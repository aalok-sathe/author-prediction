We
were
seated
at
breakfast
one
morning,
my
wife
and
I,
when
the
maid
brought
in
a
telegram.
It
was
from
Sherlock
Holmes
and
ran
in
this
way:
"Have
you
a
couple
of
days
to
spare?
Have
just
been
wired
for
from
the
west
of
England
in
connection
with
Boscombe
Valley
tragedy.
Shall
be
glad
if
you
will
come
with
me.
Air
and
scenery
perfect.
Leave
Paddington
by
the
11:15."
"What
do
you
say,
dear?"
said
my
wife,
looking
across
at
me.
"Will
you
go?"
"I
really
don't
know
what
to
say.
I
have
a
fairly
long
list
at
present."
"Oh,
Anstruther
would
do
your
work
for
you.
You
have
been
looking
a
little
pale
lately.
I
think
that
the
change
would
do
you
good,
and
you
are
always
so
interested
in
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes'
cases."
"I
should
be
ungrateful
if
I
were
not,
seeing
what
I
gained
through
one
of
them,"
I
answered.
"But
if
I
am
to
go,
I
must
pack
at
once,
for
I
have
only
half
an
hour."
My
experience
of
camp
life
in
Afghanistan
had
at
least
had
the
effect
of
making
me
a
prompt
and
ready
traveller.
My
wants
were
few
and
simple,
so
that
in
less
than
the
time
stated
I
was
in
a
cab
with
my
valise,
rattling
away
to
Paddington
Station.
Sherlock
Holmes
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
platform,
his
tall,
gaunt
figure
made
even
gaunter
and
taller
by
his
long
grey
travelling-cloak
and
close-fitting
cloth
cap.
"It
is
really
very
good
of
you
to
come,
Watson,"
said
he.
"It
makes
a
considerable
difference
to
me,
having
someone
with
me
on
whom
I
can
thoroughly
rely.
Local
aid
is
always
either
worthless
or
else
biassed.
If
you
will
keep
the
two
corner
seats
I
shall
get
the
tickets."
We
had
the
carriage
to
ourselves
save
for
an
immense
litter
of
papers
which
Holmes
had
brought
with
him.
Among
these
he
rummaged
and
read,
with
intervals
of
note-taking
and
of
meditation,
until
we
were
past
Reading.
Then
he
suddenly
rolled
them
all
into
a
gigantic
ball
and
tossed
them
up
onto
the
rack.
"Have
you
heard
anything
of
the
case?"
he
asked.
"Not
a
word.
I
have
not
seen
a
paper
for
some
days."
"The
London
press
has
not
had
very
full
accounts.
I
have
just
been
looking
through
all
the
recent
papers
in
order
to
master
the
particulars.
It
seems,
from
what
I
gather,
to
be
one
of
those
simple
cases
which
are
so
extremely
difficult."
"That
sounds
a
little
paradoxical."
"But
it
is
profoundly
true.
Singularity
is
almost
invariably
a
clue.
The
more
featureless
and
commonplace
a
crime
is,
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
bring
it
home.
In
this
case,
however,
they
have
established
a
very
serious
case
against
the
son
of
the
murdered
man."
"It
is
a
murder,
then?"
"Well,
it
is
conjectured
to
be
so.
I
shall
take
nothing
for
granted
until
I
have
the
opportunity
of
looking
personally
into
it.
I
will
explain
the
state
of
things
to
you,
as
far
as
I
have
been
able
to
understand
it,
in
a
very
few
words.
"Boscombe
Valley
is
a
country
district
not
very
far
from
Ross,
in
Herefordshire.
The
largest
landed
proprietor
in
that
part
is
a
Mr.
John
Turner,
who
made
his
money
in
Australia
and
returned
some
years
ago
to
the
old
country.
One
of
the
farms
which
he
held,
that
of
Hatherley,
was
let
to
Mr.
Charles
McCarthy,
who
was
also
an
ex-Australian.
The
men
had
known
each
other
in
the
colonies,
so
that
it
was
not
unnatural
that
when
they
came
to
settle
down
they
should
do
so
as
near
each
other
as
possible.
Turner
was
apparently
the
richer
man,
so
McCarthy
became
his
tenant
but
still
remained,
it
seems,
upon
terms
of
perfect
equality,
as
they
were
frequently
together.
McCarthy
had
one
son,
a
lad
of
eighteen,
and
Turner
had
an
only
daughter
of
the
same
age,
but
neither
of
them
had
wives
living.
They
appear
to
have
avoided
the
society
of
the
neighbouring
English
families
and
to
have
led
retired
lives,
though
both
the
McCarthys
were
fond
of
sport
and
were
frequently
seen
at
the
race-meetings
of
the
neighbourhood.
McCarthy
kept
two
servants--a
man
and
a
girl.
Turner
had
a
considerable
household,
some
half-dozen
at
the
least.
That
is
as
much
as
I
have
been
able
to
gather
about
the
families.
Now
for
the
facts.
"On
June
3rd,
that
is,
on
Monday
last,
McCarthy
left
his
house
at
Hatherley
about
three
in
the
afternoon
and
walked
down
to
the
Boscombe
Pool,
which
is
a
small
lake
formed
by
the
spreading
out
of
the
stream
which
runs
down
the
Boscombe
Valley.
He
had
been
out
with
his
serving-man
in
the
morning
at
Ross,
and
he
had
told
the
man
that
he
must
hurry,
as
he
had
an
appointment
of
importance
to
keep
at
three.
From
that
appointment
he
never
came
back
alive.
"From
Hatherley
Farm-house
to
the
Boscombe
Pool
is
a
quarter
of
a
mile,
and
two
people
saw
him
as
he
passed
over
this
ground.
One
was
an
old
woman,
whose
name
is
not
mentioned,
and
the
other
was
William
Crowder,
a
game-keeper
in
the
employ
of
Mr.
Turner.
Both
these
witnesses
depose
that
Mr.
McCarthy
was
walking
alone.
The
game-keeper
adds
that
within
a
few
minutes
of
his
seeing
Mr.
McCarthy
pass
he
had
seen
his
son,
Mr.
James
McCarthy,
going
the
same
way
with
a
gun
under
his
arm.
To
the
best
of
his
belief,
the
father
was
actually
in
sight
at
the
time,
and
the
son
was
following
him.
He
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
until
he
heard
in
the
evening
of
the
tragedy
that
had
occurred.
"The
two
McCarthys
were
seen
after
the
time
when
William
Crowder,
the
game-keeper,
lost
sight
of
them.
The
Boscombe
Pool
is
thickly
wooded
round,
with
just
a
fringe
of
grass
and
of
reeds
round
the
edge.
A
girl
of
fourteen,
Patience
Moran,
who
is
the
daughter
of
the
lodge-keeper
of
the
Boscombe
Valley
estate,
was
in
one
of
the
woods
picking
flowers.
She
states
that
while
she
was
there
she
saw,
at
the
border
of
the
wood
and
close
by
the
lake,
Mr.
McCarthy
and
his
son,
and
that
they
appeared
to
be
having
a
violent
quarrel.
She
heard
Mr.
McCarthy
the
elder
using
very
strong
language
to
his
son,
and
she
saw
the
latter
raise
up
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
his
father.
She
was
so
frightened
by
their
violence
that
she
ran
away
and
told
her
mother
when
she
reached
home
that
she
had
left
the
two
McCarthys
quarrelling
near
Boscombe
Pool,
and
that
she
was
afraid
that
they
were
going
to
fight.
She
had
hardly
said
the
words
when
young
Mr.
McCarthy
came
running
up
to
the
lodge
to
say
that
he
had
found
his
father
dead
in
the
wood,
and
to
ask
for
the
help
of
the
lodge-keeper.
He
was
much
excited,
without
either
his
gun
or
his
hat,
and
his
right
hand
and
sleeve
were
observed
to
be
stained
with
fresh
blood.
On
following
him
they
found
the
dead
body
stretched
out
upon
the
grass
beside
the
pool.
The
head
had
been
beaten
in
by
repeated
blows
of
some
heavy
and
blunt
weapon.
The
injuries
were
such
as
might
very
well
have
been
inflicted
by
the
butt-end
of
his
son's
gun,
which
was
found
lying
on
the
grass
within
a
few
paces
of
the
body.
Under
these
circumstances
the
young
man
was
instantly
arrested,
and
a
verdict
of
'wilful
murder'
having
been
returned
at
the
inquest
on
Tuesday,
he
was
on
Wednesday
brought
before
the
magistrates
at
Ross,
who
have
referred
the
case
to
the
next
Assizes.
Those
are
the
main
facts
of
the
case
as
they
came
out
before
the
coroner
and
the
police-court."
"I
could
hardly
imagine
a
more
damning
case,"
I
remarked.
"If
ever
circumstantial
evidence
pointed
to
a
criminal
it
does
so
here."
"Circumstantial
evidence
is
a
very
tricky
thing,"
answered
Holmes
thoughtfully.
"It
may
seem
to
point
very
straight
to
one
thing,
but
if
you
shift
your
own
point
of
view
a
little,
you
may
find
it
pointing
in
an
equally
uncompromising
manner
to
something
entirely
different.
It
must
be
confessed,
however,
that
the
case
looks
exceedingly
grave
against
the
young
man,
and
it
is
very
possible
that
he
is
indeed
the
culprit.
There
are
several
people
in
the
neighbourhood,
however,
and
among
them
Miss
Turner,
the
daughter
of
the
neighbouring
landowner,
who
believe
in
his
innocence,
and
who
have
retained
Lestrade,
whom
you
may
recollect
in
connection
with
the
Study
in
Scarlet,
to
work
out
the
case
in
his
interest.
Lestrade,
being
rather
puzzled,
has
referred
the
case
to
me,
and
hence
it
is
that
two
middle-aged
gentlemen
are
flying
westward
at
fifty
miles
an
hour
instead
of
quietly
digesting
their
breakfasts
at
home."
"I
am
afraid,"
said
I,
"that
the
facts
are
so
obvious
that
you
will
find
little
credit
to
be
gained
out
of
this
case."
"There
is
nothing
more
deceptive
than
an
obvious
fact,"
he
answered,
laughing.
"Besides,
we
may
chance
to
hit
upon
some
other
obvious
facts
which
may
have
been
by
no
means
obvious
to
Mr.
Lestrade.
You
know
me
too
well
to
think
that
I
am
boasting
when
I
say
that
I
shall
either
confirm
or
destroy
his
theory
by
means
which
he
is
quite
incapable
of
employing,
or
even
of
understanding.
To
take
the
first
example
to
hand,
I
very
clearly
perceive
that
in
your
bedroom
the
window
is
upon
the
right-hand
side,
and
yet
I
question
whether
Mr.
Lestrade
would
have
noted
even
so
self-evident
a
thing
as
that."
"How
on
earth--"
"My
dear
fellow,
I
know
you
well.
I
know
the
military
neatness
which
characterises
you.
You
shave
every
morning,
and
in
this
season
you
shave
by
the
sunlight;
but
since
your
shaving
is
less
and
less
complete
as
we
get
farther
back
on
the
left
side,
until
it
becomes
positively
slovenly
as
we
get
round
the
angle
of
the
jaw,
it
is
surely
very
clear
that
that
side
is
less
illuminated
than
the
other.
I
could
not
imagine
a
man
of
your
habits
looking
at
himself
in
an
equal
light
and
being
satisfied
with
such
a
result.
I
only
quote
this
as
a
trivial
example
of
observation
and
inference.
Therein
lies
my
metier,
and
it
is
just
possible
that
it
may
be
of
some
service
in
the
investigation
which
lies
before
us.
There
are
one
or
two
minor
points
which
were
brought
out
in
the
inquest,
and
which
are
worth
considering."
"What
are
they?"
"It
appears
that
his
arrest
did
not
take
place
at
once,
but
after
the
return
to
Hatherley
Farm.
On
the
inspector
of
constabulary
informing
him
that
he
was
a
prisoner,
he
remarked
that
he
was
not
surprised
to
hear
it,
and
that
it
was
no
more
than
his
deserts.
This
observation
of
his
had
the
natural
effect
of
removing
any
traces
of
doubt
which
might
have
remained
in
the
minds
of
the
coroner's
jury."
"It
was
a
confession,"
I
ejaculated.
"No,
for
it
was
followed
by
a
protestation
of
innocence."
"Coming
on
the
top
of
such
a
damning
series
of
events,
it
was
at
least
a
most
suspicious
remark."
"On
the
contrary,"
said
Holmes,
"it
is
the
brightest
rift
which
I
can
at
present
see
in
the
clouds.
However
innocent
he
might
be,
he
could
not
be
such
an
absolute
imbecile
as
not
to
see
that
the
circumstances
were
very
black
against
him.
Had
he
appeared
surprised
at
his
own
arrest,
or
feigned
indignation
at
it,
I
should
have
looked
upon
it
as
highly
suspicious,
because
such
surprise
or
anger
would
not
be
natural
under
the
circumstances,
and
yet
might
appear
to
be
the
best
policy
to
a
scheming
man.
His
frank
acceptance
of
the
situation
marks
him
as
either
an
innocent
man,
or
else
as
a
man
of
considerable
self-restraint
and
firmness.
As
to
his
remark
about
his
deserts,
it
was
also
not
unnatural
if
you
consider
that
he
stood
beside
the
dead
body
of
his
father,
and
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
had
that
very
day
so
far
forgotten
his
filial
duty
as
to
bandy
words
with
him,
and
even,
according
to
the
little
girl
whose
evidence
is
so
important,
to
raise
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
him.
The
self-reproach
and
contrition
which
are
displayed
in
his
remark
appear
to
me
to
be
the
signs
of
a
healthy
mind
rather
than
of
a
guilty
one."
I
shook
my
head.
"Many
men
have
been
hanged
on
far
slighter
evidence,"
I
remarked.
"So
they
have.
And
many
men
have
been
wrongfully
hanged."
"What
is
the
young
man's
own
account
of
the
matter?"
"It
is,
I
am
afraid,
not
very
encouraging
to
his
supporters,
though
there
are
one
or
two
points
in
it
which
are
suggestive.
You
will
find
it
here,
and
may
read
it
for
yourself."
He
picked
out
from
his
bundle
a
copy
of
the
local
Herefordshire
paper,
and
having
turned
down
the
sheet
he
pointed
out
the
paragraph
in
which
the
unfortunate
young
man
had
given
his
own
statement
of
what
had
occurred.
I
settled
myself
down
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
and
read
it
very
carefully.
It
ran
in
this
way:
"Mr.
James
McCarthy,
the
only
son
of
the
deceased,
was
then
called
and
gave
evidence
as
follows:
'I
had
been
away
from
home
for
three
days
at
Bristol,
and
had
only
just
returned
upon
the
morning
of
last
Monday,
the
3rd.
My
father
was
absent
from
home
at
the
time
of
my
arrival,
and
I
was
informed
by
the
maid
that
he
had
driven
over
to
Ross
with
John
Cobb,
the
groom.
Shortly
after
my
return
I
heard
the
wheels
of
his
trap
in
the
yard,
and,
looking
out
of
my
window,
I
saw
him
get
out
and
walk
rapidly
out
of
the
yard,
though
I
was
not
aware
in
which
direction
he
was
going.
I
then
took
my
gun
and
strolled
out
in
the
direction
of
the
Boscombe
Pool,
with
the
intention
of
visiting
the
rabbit
warren
which
is
upon
the
other
side.
On
my
way
I
saw
William
Crowder,
the
game-keeper,
as
he
had
stated
in
his
evidence;
but
he
is
mistaken
in
thinking
that
I
was
following
my
father.
I
had
no
idea
that
he
was
in
front
of
me.
When
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
pool
I
heard
a
cry
of
"Cooee!"
which
was
a
usual
signal
between
my
father
and
myself.
I
then
hurried
forward,
and
found
him
standing
by
the
pool.
He
appeared
to
be
much
surprised
at
seeing
me
and
asked
me
rather
roughly
what
I
was
doing
there.
A
conversation
ensued
which
led
to
high
words
and
almost
to
blows,
for
my
father
was
a
man
of
a
very
violent
temper.
Seeing
that
his
passion
was
becoming
ungovernable,
I
left
him
and
returned
towards
Hatherley
Farm.
I
had
not
gone
more
than
150
yards,
however,
when
I
heard
a
hideous
outcry
behind
me,
which
caused
me
to
run
back
again.
I
found
my
father
expiring
upon
the
ground,
with
his
head
terribly
injured.
I
dropped
my
gun
and
held
him
in
my
arms,
but
he
almost
instantly
expired.
I
knelt
beside
him
for
some
minutes,
and
then
made
my
way
to
Mr.
Turner's
lodge-keeper,
his
house
being
the
nearest,
to
ask
for
assistance.
I
saw
no
one
near
my
father
when
I
returned,
and
I
have
no
idea
how
he
came
by
his
injuries.
He
was
not
a
popular
man,
being
somewhat
cold
and
forbidding
in
his
manners,
but
he
had,
as
far
as
I
know,
no
active
enemies.
I
know
nothing
further
of
the
matter.'
"The
Coroner:
Did
your
father
make
any
statement
to
you
before
he
died?
"Witness:
He
mumbled
a
few
words,
but
I
could
only
catch
some
allusion
to
a
rat.
"The
Coroner:
What
did
you
understand
by
that?
"Witness:
It
conveyed
no
meaning
to
me.
I
thought
that
he
was
delirious.
"The
Coroner:
What
was
the
point
upon
which
you
and
your
father
had
this
final
quarrel?
"Witness:
I
should
prefer
not
to
answer.
"The
Coroner:
I
am
afraid
that
I
must
press
it.
"Witness:
It
is
really
impossible
for
me
to
tell
you.
I
can
assure
you
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sad
tragedy
which
followed.
"The
Coroner:
That
is
for
the
court
to
decide.
I
need
not
point
out
to
you
that
your
refusal
to
answer
will
prejudice
your
case
considerably
in
any
future
proceedings
which
may
arise.
"Witness:
I
must
still
refuse.
"The
Coroner:
I
understand
that
the
cry
of
'Cooee'
was
a
common
signal
between
you
and
your
father?
"Witness:
It
was.
"The
Coroner:
How
was
it,
then,
that
he
uttered
it
before
he
saw
you,
and
before
he
even
knew
that
you
had
returned
from
Bristol?
"Witness
(with
considerable
confusion):
I
do
not
know.
"A
Juryman:
Did
you
see
nothing
which
aroused
your
suspicions
when
you
returned
on
hearing
the
cry
and
found
your
father
fatally
injured?
"Witness:
Nothing
definite.
"The
Coroner:
What
do
you
mean?
"Witness:
I
was
so
disturbed
and
excited
as
I
rushed
out
into
the
open,
that
I
could
think
of
nothing
except
of
my
father.
Yet
I
have
a
vague
impression
that
as
I
ran
forward
something
lay
upon
the
ground
to
the
left
of
me.
It
seemed
to
me
to
be
something
grey
in
colour,
a
coat
of
some
sort,
or
a
plaid
perhaps.
When
I
rose
from
my
father
I
looked
round
for
it,
but
it
was
gone.
"'Do
you
mean
that
it
disappeared
before
you
went
for
help?'
"'Yes,
it
was
gone.'
"'You
cannot
say
what
it
was?'
"'No,
I
had
a
feeling
something
was
there.'
"'How
far
from
the
body?'
"'A
dozen
yards
or
so.'
"'And
how
far
from
the
edge
of
the
wood?'
"'About
the
same.'
"'Then
if
it
was
removed
it
was
while
you
were
within
a
dozen
yards
of
it?'
"'Yes,
but
with
my
back
towards
it.'
"This
concluded
the
examination
of
the
witness."
"I
see,"
said
I
as
I
glanced
down
the
column,
"that
the
coroner
in
his
concluding
remarks
was
rather
severe
upon
young
McCarthy.
He
calls
attention,
and
with
reason,
to
the
discrepancy
about
his
father
having
signalled
to
him
before
seeing
him,
also
to
his
refusal
to
give
details
of
his
conversation
with
his
father,
and
his
singular
account
of
his
father's
dying
words.
They
are
all,
as
he
remarks,
very
much
against
the
son."
Holmes
laughed
softly
to
himself
and
stretched
himself
out
upon
the
cushioned
seat.
"Both
you
and
the
coroner
have
been
at
some
pains,"
said
he,
"to
single
out
the
very
strongest
points
in
the
young
man's
favour.
Don't
you
see
that
you
alternately
give
him
credit
for
having
too
much
imagination
and
too
little?
Too
little,
if
he
could
not
invent
a
cause
of
quarrel
which
would
give
him
the
sympathy
of
the
jury;
too
much,
if
he
evolved
from
his
own
inner
consciousness
anything
so
outre
as
a
dying
reference
to
a
rat,
and
the
incident
of
the
vanishing
cloth.
No,
sir,
I
shall
approach
this
case
from
the
point
of
view
that
what
this
young
man
says
is
true,
and
we
shall
see
whither
that
hypothesis
will
lead
us.
And
now
here
is
my
pocket
Petrarch,
and
not
another
word
shall
I
say
of
this
case
until
we
are
on
the
scene
of
action.
We
lunch
at
Swindon,
and
I
see
that
we
shall
be
there
in
twenty
minutes."
It
was
nearly
four
o'clock
when
we
at
last,
after
passing
through
the
beautiful
Stroud
Valley,
and
over
the
broad
gleaming
Severn,
found
ourselves
at
the
pretty
little
country-town
of
Ross.
A
lean,
ferret-like
man,
furtive
and
sly-looking,
was
waiting
for
us
upon
the
platform.
In
spite
of
the
light
brown
dustcoat
and
leather-leggings
which
he
wore
in
deference
to
his
rustic
surroundings,
I
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
Lestrade,
of
Scotland
Yard.
With
him
we
drove
to
the
Hereford
Arms
where
a
room
had
already
been
engaged
for
us.
"I
have
ordered
a
carriage,"
said
Lestrade
as
we
sat
over
a
cup
of
tea.
"I
knew
your
energetic
nature,
and
that
you
would
not
be
happy
until
you
had
been
on
the
scene
of
the
crime."
"It
was
very
nice
and
complimentary
of
you,"
Holmes
answered.
"It
is
entirely
a
question
of
barometric
pressure."
Lestrade
looked
startled.
"I
do
not
quite
follow,"
he
said.
"How
is
the
glass?
Twenty-nine,
I
see.
No
wind,
and
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky.
I
have
a
caseful
of
cigarettes
here
which
need
smoking,
and
the
sofa
is
very
much
superior
to
the
usual
country
hotel
abomination.
I
do
not
think
that
it
is
probable
that
I
shall
use
the
carriage
to-night."
Lestrade
laughed
indulgently.
"You
have,
no
doubt,
already
formed
your
conclusions
from
the
newspapers,"
he
said.
"The
case
is
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff,
and
the
more
one
goes
into
it
the
plainer
it
becomes.
Still,
of
course,
one
can't
refuse
a
lady,
and
such
a
very
positive
one,
too.
She
has
heard
of
you,
and
would
have
your
opinion,
though
I
repeatedly
told
her
that
there
was
nothing
which
you
could
do
which
I
had
not
already
done.
Why,
bless
my
soul!
here
is
her
carriage
at
the
door."
He
had
hardly
spoken
before
there
rushed
into
the
room
one
of
the
most
lovely
young
women
that
I
have
ever
seen
in
my
life.
Her
violet
eyes
shining,
her
lips
parted,
a
pink
flush
upon
her
cheeks,
all
thought
of
her
natural
reserve
lost
in
her
overpowering
excitement
and
concern.
"Oh,
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes!"
she
cried,
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
us,
and
finally,
with
a
woman's
quick
intuition,
fastening
upon
my
companion,
"I
am
so
glad
that
you
have
come.
I
have
driven
down
to
tell
you
so.
I
know
that
James
didn't
do
it.
I
know
it,
and
I
want
you
to
start
upon
your
work
knowing
it,
too.
Never
let
yourself
doubt
upon
that
point.
We
have
known
each
other
since
we
were
little
children,
and
I
know
his
faults
as
no
one
else
does;
but
he
is
too
tender-hearted
to
hurt
a
fly.
Such
a
charge
is
absurd
to
anyone
who
really
knows
him."
"I
hope
we
may
clear
him,
Miss
Turner,"
said
Sherlock
Holmes.
"You
may
rely
upon
my
doing
all
that
I
can."
"But
you
have
read
the
evidence.
You
have
formed
some
conclusion?
Do
you
not
see
some
loophole,
some
flaw?
Do
you
not
yourself
think
that
he
is
innocent?"
"I
think
that
it
is
very
probable."
"There,
now!"
she
cried,
throwing
back
her
head
and
looking
defiantly
at
Lestrade.
"You
hear!
He
gives
me
hopes."
Lestrade
shrugged
his
shoulders.
"I
am
afraid
that
my
colleague
has
been
a
little
quick
in
forming
his
conclusions,"
he
said.
"But
he
is
right.
Oh!
I
know
that
he
is
right.
James
never
did
it.
And
about
his
quarrel
with
his
father,
I
am
sure
that
the
reason
why
he
would
not
speak
about
it
to
the
coroner
was
because
I
was
concerned
in
it."
"In
what
way?"
asked
Holmes.
"It
is
no
time
for
me
to
hide
anything.
James
and
his
father
had
many
disagreements
about
me.
Mr.
McCarthy
was
very
anxious
that
there
should
be
a
marriage
between
us.
James
and
I
have
always
loved
each
other
as
brother
and
sister;
but
of
course
he
is
young
and
has
seen
very
little
of
life
yet,
and--and--well,
he
naturally
did
not
wish
to
do
anything
like
that
yet.
So
there
were
quarrels,
and
this,
I
am
sure,
was
one
of
them."
"And
your
father?"
asked
Holmes.
"Was
he
in
favour
of
such
a
union?"
"No,
he
was
averse
to
it
also.
No
one
but
Mr.
McCarthy
was
in
favour
of
it."
A
quick
blush
passed
over
her
fresh
young
face
as
Holmes
shot
one
of
his
keen,
questioning
glances
at
her.
"Thank
you
for
this
information,"
said
he.
"May
I
see
your
father
if
I
call
to-morrow?"
"I
am
afraid
the
doctor
won't
allow
it."
"The
doctor?"
"Yes,
have
you
not
heard?
Poor
father
has
never
been
strong
for
years
back,
but
this
has
broken
him
down
completely.
He
has
taken
to
his
bed,
and
Dr.
Willows
says
that
he
is
a
wreck
and
that
his
nervous
system
is
shattered.
Mr.
McCarthy
was
the
only
man
alive
who
had
known
dad
in
the
old
days
in
Victoria."
"Ha!
In
Victoria!
That
is
important."
"Yes,
at
the
mines."
"Quite
so;
at
the
gold-mines,
where,
as
I
understand,
Mr.
Turner
made
his
money."
"Yes,
certainly."
"Thank
you,
Miss
Turner.
You
have
been
of
material
assistance
to
me."
"You
will
tell
me
if
you
have
any
news
to-morrow.
No
doubt
you
will
go
to
the
prison
to
see
James.
Oh,
if
you
do,
Mr.
Holmes,
do
tell
him
that
I
know
him
to
be
innocent."
"I
will,
Miss
Turner."
"I
must
go
home
now,
for
dad
is
very
ill,
and
he
misses
me
so
if
I
leave
him.
Good-bye,
and
God
help
you
in
your
undertaking."
She
hurried
from
the
room
as
impulsively
as
she
had
entered,
and
we
heard
the
wheels
of
her
carriage
rattle
off
down
the
street.
"I
am
ashamed
of
you,
Holmes,"
said
Lestrade
with
dignity
after
a
few
minutes'
silence.
"Why
should
you
raise
up
hopes
which
you
are
bound
to
disappoint?
I
am
not
over-tender
of
heart,
but
I
call
it
cruel."
"I
think
that
I
see
my
way
to
clearing
James
McCarthy,"
said
Holmes.
"Have
you
an
order
to
see
him
in
prison?"
"Yes,
but
only
for
you
and
me."
"Then
I
shall
reconsider
my
resolution
about
going
out.
We
have
still
time
to
take
a
train
to
Hereford
and
see
him
to-night?"
"Ample."
"Then
let
us
do
so.
Watson,
I
fear
that
you
will
find
it
very
slow,
but
I
shall
only
be
away
a
couple
of
hours."
I
walked
down
to
the
station
with
them,
and
then
wandered
through
the
streets
of
the
little
town,
finally
returning
to
the
hotel,
where
I
lay
upon
the
sofa
and
tried
to
interest
myself
in
a
yellow-backed
novel.
The
puny
plot
of
the
story
was
so
thin,
however,
when
compared
to
the
deep
mystery
through
which
we
were
groping,
and
I
found
my
attention
wander
so
continually
from
the
action
to
the
fact,
that
I
at
last
flung
it
across
the
room
and
gave
myself
up
entirely
to
a
consideration
of
the
events
of
the
day.
Supposing
that
this
unhappy
young
man's
story
were
absolutely
true,
then
what
hellish
thing,
what
absolutely
unforeseen
and
extraordinary
calamity
could
have
occurred
between
the
time
when
he
parted
from
his
father,
and
the
moment
when,
drawn
back
by
his
screams,
he
rushed
into
the
glade?
It
was
something
terrible
and
deadly.
What
could
it
be?
Might
not
the
nature
of
the
injuries
reveal
something
to
my
medical
instincts?
I
rang
the
bell
and
called
for
the
weekly
county
paper,
which
contained
a
verbatim
account
of
the
inquest.
In
the
surgeon's
deposition
it
was
stated
that
the
posterior
third
of
the
left
parietal
bone
and
the
left
half
of
the
occipital
bone
had
been
shattered
by
a
heavy
blow
from
a
blunt
weapon.
I
marked
the
spot
upon
my
own
head.
Clearly
such
a
blow
must
have
been
struck
from
behind.
That
was
to
some
extent
in
favour
of
the
accused,
as
when
seen
quarrelling
he
was
face
to
face
with
his
father.
Still,
it
did
not
go
for
very
much,
for
the
older
man
might
have
turned
his
back
before
the
blow
fell.
Still,
it
might
be
worth
while
to
call
Holmes'
attention
to
it.
Then
there
was
the
peculiar
dying
reference
to
a
rat.
What
could
that
mean?
It
could
not
be
delirium.
A
man
dying
from
a
sudden
blow
does
not
commonly
become
delirious.
No,
it
was
more
likely
to
be
an
attempt
to
explain
how
he
met
his
fate.
But
what
could
it
indicate?
I
cudgelled
my
brains
to
find
some
possible
explanation.
And
then
the
incident
of
the
grey
cloth
seen
by
young
McCarthy.
If
that
were
true
the
murderer
must
have
dropped
some
part
of
his
dress,
presumably
his
overcoat,
in
his
flight,
and
must
have
had
the
hardihood
to
return
and
to
carry
it
away
at
the
instant
when
the
son
was
kneeling
with
his
back
turned
not
a
dozen
paces
off.
What
a
tissue
of
mysteries
and
improbabilities
the
whole
thing
was!
I
did
not
wonder
at
Lestrade's
opinion,
and
yet
I
had
so
much
faith
in
Sherlock
Holmes'
insight
that
I
could
not
lose
hope
as
long
as
every
fresh
fact
seemed
to
strengthen
his
conviction
of
young
McCarthy's
innocence.
It
was
late
before
Sherlock
Holmes
returned.
He
came
back
alone,
for
