until
Lestrade
succeeded
in
getting
his
hand
inside
his
neckcloth
and
half
strangling
him
that
we
made
him
realize
that
his
struggles
were
of
no
avail;
and
even
then
we
felt
no
security
until
we
had
pinioned
his
feet
as
well
as
his
hands.
That
done,
we
rose
to
our
feet
breathless
and
panting.
"We
have
his
cab,"
said
Sherlock
Holmes.
"It
will
serve
to
take
him
to
Scotland
Yard.
And
now,
gentlemen,"
he
continued,
with
a
pleasant
smile,
"we
have
reached
the
end
of
our
little
mystery.
You
are
very
welcome
to
put
any
questions
that
you
like
to
me
now,
and
there
is
no
danger
that
I
will
refuse
to
answer
them."
IN
the
central
portion
of
the
great
North
American
Continent
there
lies
an
arid
and
repulsive
desert,
which
for
many
a
long
year
served
as
a
barrier
against
the
advance
of
civilisation.
From
the
Sierra
Nevada
to
Nebraska,
and
from
the
Yellowstone
River
in
the
north
to
the
Colorado
upon
the
south,
is
a
region
of
desolation
and
silence.
Nor
is
Nature
always
in
one
mood
throughout
this
grim
district.
It
comprises
snow
capped
and
lofty
mountains,
and
dark
and
gloomy
valleys.
There
are
swift
flowing
rivers
which
dash
through
jagged
canons;
and
there
are
enormous
plains,
which
in
winter
are
white
with
snow,
and
in
summer
are
grey
with
the
saline
alkali
dust.
They
all
preserve,
however,
the
common
characteristics
of
barrenness,
inhospitality,
and
misery.
There
are
no
inhabitants
of
this
land
of
despair.
A
band
of
Pawnees
or
of
Blackfeet
may
occasionally
traverse
it
in
order
to
reach
other
hunting
grounds,
but
the
hardiest
of
the
braves
are
glad
to
lose
sight
of
those
awesome
plains,
and
to
find
themselves
once
more
upon
their
prairies.
The
coyote
skulks
among
the
scrub,
the
buzzard
flaps
heavily
through
the
air,
and
the
clumsy
grizzly
bear
lumbers
through
the
dark
ravines,
and
picks
up
such
sustenance
as
it
can
amongst
the
rocks.
These
are
the
sole
dwellers
in
the
wilderness.
In
the
whole
world
there
can
be
no
more
dreary
view
than
that
from
the
northern
slope
of
the
Sierra
Blanco.
As
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
stretches
the
great
flat
plain
land,
all
dusted
over
with
patches
of
alkali,
and
intersected
by
clumps
of
the
dwarfish
chaparral
bushes.
On
the
extreme
verge
of
the
horizon
lie
a
long
chain
of
mountain
peaks,
with
their
rugged
summits
flecked
with
snow.
In
this
great
stretch
of
country
there
is
no
sign
of
life,
nor
of
anything
appertaining
to
life.
There
is
no
bird
in
the
steel
blue
heaven,
no
movement
upon
the
dull,
grey
earth
above
all,
there
is
absolute
silence.
Listen
as
one
may,
there
is
no
shadow
of
a
sound
in
all
that
mighty
wilderness;
nothing
but
silence
complete
and
heart
subduing
silence.
It
has
been
said
there
is
nothing
appertaining
to
life
upon
the
broad
plain.
That
is
hardly
true.
Looking
down
from
the
Sierra
Blanco,
one
sees
a
pathway
traced
out
across
the
desert,
which
winds
away
and
is
lost
in
the
extreme
distance.
It
is
rutted
with
wheels
and
trodden
down
by
the
feet
of
many
adventurers.
Here
and
there
there
are
scattered
white
objects
which
glisten
in
the
sun,
and
stand
out
against
the
dull
deposit
of
alkali.
Approach,
and
examine
them!
They
are
bones:
some
large
and
coarse,
others
smaller
and
more
delicate.
The
former
have
belonged
to
oxen,
and
the
latter
to
men.
For
fifteen
hundred
miles
one
may
trace
this
ghastly
caravan
route
by
these
scattered
remains
of
those
who
had
fallen
by
the
wayside.
Looking
down
on
this
very
scene,
there
stood
upon
the
fourth
of
May,
eighteen
hundred
and
forty
seven,
a
solitary
traveller.
His
appearance
was
such
that
he
might
have
been
the
very
genius
or
demon
of
the
region.
An
observer
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
say
whether
he
was
nearer
to
forty
or
to
sixty.
His
face
was
lean
and
haggard,
and
the
brown
parchment
like
skin
was
drawn
tightly
over
the
projecting
bones;
his
long,
brown
hair
and
beard
were
all
flecked
and
dashed
with
white;
his
eyes
were
sunken
in
his
head,
and
burned
with
an
unnatural
lustre;
while
the
hand
which
grasped
his
rifle
was
hardly
more
fleshy
than
that
of
a
skeleton.
As
he
stood,
he
leaned
upon
his
weapon
for
support,
and
yet
his
tall
figure
and
the
massive
framework
of
his
bones
suggested
a
wiry
and
vigorous
constitution.
His
gaunt
face,
however,
and
his
clothes,
which
hung
so
baggily
over
his
shrivelled
limbs,
proclaimed
what
it
was
that
gave
him
that
senile
and
decrepit
appearance.
The
man
was
dying
dying
from
hunger
and
from
thirst.
He
had
toiled
painfully
down
the
ravine,
and
on
to
this
little
elevation,
in
the
vain
hope
of
seeing
some
signs
of
water.
Now
the
great
salt
plain
stretched
before
his
eyes,
and
the
distant
belt
of
savage
mountains,
without
a
sign
anywhere
of
plant
or
tree,
which
might
indicate
the
presence
of
moisture.
In
all
that
broad
landscape
there
was
no
gleam
of
hope.
North,
and
east,
and
west
he
looked
with
wild
questioning
eyes,
and
then
he
realised
that
his
wanderings
had
come
to
an
end,
and
that
there,
on
that
barren
crag,
he
was
about
to
die.
"Why
not
here,
as
well
as
in
a
feather
bed,
twenty
years
hence,"
he
muttered,
as
he
seated
himself
in
the
shelter
of
a
boulder.
Before
sitting
down,
he
had
deposited
upon
the
ground
his
useless
rifle,
and
also
a
large
bundle
tied
up
in
a
grey
shawl,
which
he
had
carried
slung
over
his
right
shoulder.
It
appeared
to
be
somewhat
too
heavy
for
his
strength,
for
in
lowering
it,
it
came
down
on
the
ground
with
some
little
violence.
Instantly
there
broke
from
the
grey
parcel
a
little
moaning
cry,
and
from
it
there
protruded
a
small,
scared
face,
with
very
bright
brown
eyes,
and
two
little
speckled,
dimpled
fists.
"You've
hurt
me!"
said
a
childish
voice
reproachfully.
"Have
I
though,"
the
man
answered
penitently,
"I
didn't
go
for
to
do
it."
As
he
spoke
he
unwrapped
the
grey
shawl
and
extricated
a
pretty
little
girl
of
about
five
years
of
age,
whose
dainty
shoes
and
smart
pink
frock
with
its
little
linen
apron
all
bespoke
a
mother's
care.
The
child
was
pale
and
wan,
but
her
healthy
arms
and
legs
showed
that
she
had
suffered
less
than
her
companion.
"How
is
it
now?"
he
answered
anxiously,
for
she
was
still
rubbing
the
towsy
golden
curls
which
covered
the
back
of
her
head.
"Kiss
it
and
make
it
well,"
she
said,
with
perfect
gravity,
shoving
the
injured
part
up
to
him.
"That's
what
mother
used
to
do.
Where's
mother?"
"Mother's
gone.
I
guess
you'll
see
her
before
long."
"Gone,
eh!"
said
the
little
girl.
"Funny,
she
didn't
say
good
bye;
she
'most
always
did
if
she
was
just
goin'
over
to
Auntie's
for
tea,
and
now
she's
been
away
three
days.
Say,
it's
awful
dry,
ain't
it?
Ain't
there
no
water,
nor
nothing
to
eat?"
"No,
there
ain't
nothing,
dearie.
You'll
just
need
to
be
patient
awhile,
and
then
you'll
be
all
right.
Put
your
head
up
agin
me
like
that,
and
then
you'll
feel
bullier.
It
ain't
easy
to
talk
when
your
lips
is
like
leather,
but
I
guess
I'd
best
let
you
know
how
the
cards
lie.
What's
that
you've
got?"
"Pretty
things!
fine
things!"
cried
the
little
girl
enthusiastically,
holding
up
two
glittering
fragments
of
mica.
"When
we
goes
back
to
home
I'll
give
them
to
brother
Bob."
"You'll
see
prettier
things
than
them
soon,"
said
the
man
confidently.
"You
just
wait
a
bit.
I
was
going
to
tell
you
though
you
remember
when
we
left
the
river?"
"Oh,
yes."
"Well,
we
reckoned
we'd
strike
another
river
soon,
d'ye
see.
But
there
was
somethin'
wrong;
compasses,
or
map,
or
somethin',
and
it
didn't
turn
up.
Water
ran
out.
Just
except
a
little
drop
for
the
likes
of
you
and
and
"
"And
you
couldn't
wash
yourself,"
interrupted
his
companion
gravely,
staring
up
at
his
grimy
visage.
"No,
nor
drink.
And
Mr.
Bender,
he
was
the
fust
to
go,
and
then
Indian
Pete,
and
then
Mrs.
McGregor,
and
then
Johnny
Hones,
and
then,
dearie,
your
mother."
"Then
mother's
a
deader
too,"
cried
the
little
girl
dropping
her
face
in
her
pinafore
and
sobbing
bitterly.
"Yes,
they
all
went
except
you
and
me.
Then
I
thought
there
was
some
chance
of
water
in
this
direction,
so
I
heaved
you
over
my
shoulder
and
we
tramped
it
together.
It
don't
seem
as
though
we've
improved
matters.
There's
an
almighty
small
chance
for
us
now!"
"Do
you
mean
that
we
are
going
to
die
too?"
asked
the
child,
checking
her
sobs,
and
raising
her
tear
stained
face.
"I
guess
that's
about
the
size
of
it."
"Why
didn't
you
say
so
before?"
she
said,
laughing
gleefully.
"You
gave
me
such
a
fright.
Why,
of
course,
now
as
long
as
we
die
we'll
be
with
mother
again."
"Yes,
you
will,
dearie."
"And
you
too.
I'll
tell
her
how
awful
good
you've
been.
I'll
bet
she
meets
us
at
the
door
of
Heaven
with
a
big
pitcher
of
water,
and
a
lot
of
buckwheat
cakes,
hot,
and
toasted
on
both
sides,
like
Bob
and
me
was
fond
of.
How
long
will
it
be
first?"
"I
don't
know
not
very
long."
The
man's
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
northern
horizon.
In
the
blue
vault
of
the
heaven
there
had
appeared
three
little
specks
which
increased
in
size
every
moment,
so
rapidly
did
they
approach.
They
speedily
resolved
themselves
into
three
large
brown
birds,
which
circled
over
the
heads
of
the
two
wanderers,
and
then
settled
upon
some
rocks
which
overlooked
them.
They
were
buzzards,
the
vultures
of
the
west,
whose
coming
is
the
forerunner
of
death.
"Cocks
and
hens,"
cried
the
little
girl
gleefully,
pointing
at
their
ill
omened
forms,
and
clapping
her
hands
to
make
them
rise.
"Say,
did
God
make
this
country?"
"In
course
He
did,"
said
her
companion,
rather
startled
by
this
unexpected
question.
"He
made
the
country
down
in
Illinois,
and
He
made
the
Missouri,"
the
little
girl
continued.
"I
guess
somebody
else
made
the
country
in
these
parts.
It's
not
nearly
so
well
done.
They
forgot
the
water
and
the
trees."
"What
would
ye
think
of
offering
up
prayer?"
the
man
asked
diffidently.
"It
ain't
night
yet,"
she
answered.
"It
don't
matter.
It
ain't
quite
regular,
but
He
won't
mind
that,
you
bet.
You
say
over
them
ones
that
you
used
to
say
every
night
in
the
waggon
when
we
was
on
the
Plains."
"Why
don't
you
say
some
yourself?"
the
child
asked,
with
wondering
eyes.
"I
disremember
them,"
he
answered.
"I
hain't
said
none
since
I
was
half
the
height
o'
that
gun.
I
guess
it's
never
too
late.
You
say
them
out,
and
I'll
stand
by
and
come
in
on
the
choruses."
"Then
you'll
need
to
kneel
down,
and
me
too,"
she
said,
laying
the
shawl
out
for
that
purpose.
"You've
got
to
put
your
hands
up
like
this.
It
makes
you
feel
kind
o'
good."
It
was
a
strange
sight
had
there
been
anything
but
the
buzzards
to
see
it.
Side
by
side
on
the
narrow
shawl
knelt
the
two
wanderers,
the
little
prattling
child
and
the
reckless,
hardened
adventurer.
Her
chubby
face,
and
his
haggard,
angular
visage
were
both
turned
up
to
the
cloudless
heaven
in
heartfelt
entreaty
to
that
dread
being
with
whom
they
were
face
to
face,
while
the
two
voices
the
one
thin
and
clear,
the
other
deep
and
harsh
united
in
the
entreaty
for
mercy
and
forgiveness.
The
prayer
finished,
they
resumed
their
seat
in
the
shadow
of
the
boulder
until
the
child
fell
asleep,
nestling
upon
the
broad
breast
of
her
protector.
He
watched
over
her
slumber
for
some
time,
but
Nature
proved
to
be
too
strong
for
him.
For
three
days
and
three
nights
he
had
allowed
himself
neither
rest
nor
repose.
Slowly
the
eyelids
drooped
over
the
tired
eyes,
and
the
head
sunk
lower
and
lower
upon
the
breast,
until
the
man's
grizzled
beard
was
mixed
with
the
gold
tresses
of
his
companion,
and
both
slept
the
same
deep
and
dreamless
slumber.
Had
the
wanderer
remained
awake
for
another
half
hour
a
strange
sight
would
have
met
his
eyes.
Far
away
on
the
extreme
verge
of
the
alkali
plain
there
rose
up
a
little
spray
of
dust,
very
slight
at
first,
and
hardly
to
be
distinguished
from
the
mists
of
the
distance,
but
gradually
growing
higher
and
broader
until
it
formed
a
solid,
well
defined
cloud.
This
cloud
continued
to
increase
in
size
until
it
became
evident
that
it
could
only
be
raised
by
a
great
multitude
of
moving
creatures.
In
more
fertile
spots
the
observer
would
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
one
of
those
great
herds
of
bisons
which
graze
upon
the
prairie
land
was
approaching
him.
This
was
obviously
impossible
in
these
arid
wilds.
As
the
whirl
of
dust
drew
nearer
to
the
solitary
bluff
upon
which
the
two
castaways
were
reposing,
the
canvas
covered
tilts
of
waggons
and
the
figures
of
armed
horsemen
began
to
show
up
through
the
haze,
and
the
apparition
revealed
itself
as
being
a
great
caravan
upon
its
journey
for
the
West.
But
what
a
caravan!
When
the
head
of
it
had
reached
the
base
of
the
mountains,
the
rear
was
not
yet
visible
on
the
horizon.
Right
across
the
enormous
plain
stretched
the
straggling
array,
waggons
and
carts,
men
on
horseback,
and
men
on
foot.
Innumerable
women
who
staggered
along
under
burdens,
and
children
who
toddled
beside
the
waggons
or
peeped
out
from
under
the
white
coverings.
This
was
evidently
no
ordinary
party
of
immigrants,
but
rather
some
nomad
people
who
had
been
compelled
from
stress
of
circumstances
to
seek
themselves
a
new
country.
There
rose
through
the
clear
air
a
confused
clattering
and
rumbling
from
this
great
mass
of
humanity,
with
the
creaking
of
wheels
and
the
neighing
of
horses.
Loud
as
it
was,
it
was
not
sufficient
to
rouse
the
two
tired
wayfarers
above
them.
At
the
head
of
the
column
there
rode
a
score
or
more
of
grave
ironfaced
men,
clad
in
sombre
homespun
garments
and
armed
with
rifles.
On
reaching
the
base
of
the
bluff
they
halted,
and
held
a
short
council
among
themselves.
"The
wells
are
to
the
right,
my
brothers,"
said
one,
a
hard
lipped,
clean
shaven
man
with
grizzly
hair.
"To
the
right
of
the
Sierra
Blanco
so
we
shall
reach
the
Rio
Grande,"
said
another.
"Fear
not
for
water,"
cried
a
third.
"He
who
could
draw
it
from
the
rocks
will
not
now
abandon
His
own
chosen
people."
"Amen!
Amen!"
responded
the
whole
party.
They
were
about
to
resume
their
journey
when
one
of
the
youngest
and
keenest
eyed
uttered
an
exclamation
and
pointed
up
at
the
rugged
crag
above
them.
From
its
summit
there
fluttered
a
little
wisp
of
pink,
showing
up
hard
and
bright
against
the
grey
rocks
behind.
At
the
sight
there
was
a
general
reining
up
of
horses
and
unslinging
of
guns,
while
fresh
horsemen
came
galloping
up
to
reinforce
the
vanguard.
The
word
'Redskins'
was
on
every
lip.
"There
can't
be
any
number
of
Injuns
here,"
said
the
elderly
man
who
appeared
to
be
in
command.
"We
have
passed
the
Pawnees,
and
there
are
no
other
tribes
until
we
cross
the
great
mountains."
"Shall
I
go
forward
and
see,
Brother
Stangerson,"
asked
one
of
the
band.
"And
I,"
"and
I,"
cried
a
dozen
voices.
"Leave
your
horses
below
and
we
will
await
you
here,"
the
Elder
answered.
In
a
moment
the
young
fellows
had
dismounted,
fastened
their
horses,
and
were
ascending
the
precipitous
slope
which
led
up
to
the
object
which
had
excited
their
curiosity.
They
advanced
rapidly
and
noiselessly,
with
the
confidence
and
dexterity
of
practised
scouts.
The
watchers
from
the
plain
below
could
see
them
flit
from
rock
to
rock
until
their
figures
stood
out
against
the
skyline.
The
young
man
who
had
first
given
the
alarm
was
leading
them.
Suddenly
his
followers
saw
him
throw
up
his
hands,
as
though
overcome
with
astonishment,
and
on
joining
him
they
were
affected
in
the
same
way
by
the
sight
which
met
their
eyes.
On
the
little
plateau
which
crowned
the
barren
hill
there
stood
a
single
giant
boulder,
and
against
this
boulder
there
lay
a
tall
man,
long
bearded
and
hard
featured,
but
of
an
excessive
thinness.
His
placid
face
and
regular
breathing
showed
that
he
was
fast
asleep.
Beside
him
lay
a
little
child,
with
her
round
white
arms
encircling
his
brown
sinewy
neck,
and
her
golden
haired
head
resting
upon
the
breast
of
his
velveteen
tunic.
Her
rosy
lips
were
parted,
showing
the
regular
line
of
snow
white
teeth
within,
and
a
playful
smile
played
over
her
infantile
features.
Her
plump
little
white
legs
terminating
in
white
socks
and
neat
shoes
with
shining
buckles,
offered
a
strange
contrast
to
the
long
shrivelled
members
of
her
companion.
On
the
ledge
of
rock
above
this
strange
couple
there
stood
three
solemn
buzzards,
who,
at
the
sight
of
the
new
comers
uttered
raucous
screams
of
disappointment
and
flapped
sullenly
away.
The
cries
of
the
foul
birds
awoke
the
two
sleepers
who
stared
about
[20]
them
in
bewilderment.
The
man
staggered
to
his
feet
and
looked
down
upon
the
plain
which
had
been
so
desolate
when
sleep
had
overtaken
him,
and
which
was
now
traversed
by
this
enormous
body
of
men
and
of
beasts.
His
face
assumed
an
expression
of
incredulity
as
he
gazed,
and
he
passed
his
boney
hand
over
his
eyes.
"This
is
what
they
call
delirium,
I
guess,"
he
muttered.
The
child
stood
beside
him,
holding
on
to
the
skirt
of
his
coat,
and
said
nothing
but
looked
all
round
her
with
the
wondering
questioning
gaze
of
childhood.
The
rescuing
party
were
speedily
able
to
convince
the
two
castaways
that
their
appearance
was
no
delusion.
One
of
them
seized
the
little
girl,
and
hoisted
her
upon
his
shoulder,
while
two
others
supported
her
gaunt
companion,
and
assisted
him
towards
the
waggons.
"My
name
is
John
Ferrier,"
the
wanderer
explained;
"me
and
that
little
un
are
all
that's
left
o'
twenty
one
people.
The
rest
is
all
dead
o'
thirst
and
hunger
away
down
in
the
south."
"Is
she
your
child?"
asked
someone.
"I
guess
she
is
now,"
the
other
cried,
defiantly;
"she's
mine
'cause
I
saved
her.
No
man
will
take
her
from
me.
She's
Lucy
Ferrier
from
this
day
on.
Who
are
you,
though?"
he
continued,
glancing
with
curiosity
at
his
stalwart,
sunburned
rescuers;
"there
seems
to
be
a
powerful
lot
of
ye."
"Nigh
upon
ten
thousand,"
said
one
of
the
young
men;
"we
are
the
persecuted
children
of
God
the
chosen
of
the
Angel
Merona."
"I
never
heard
tell
on
him,"
said
the
wanderer.
"He
appears
to
have
chosen
a
fair
crowd
of
ye."
"Do
not
jest
at
that
which
is
sacred,"
said
the
other
sternly.
"We
are
of
those
who
believe
in
those
sacred
writings,
drawn
in
Egyptian
letters
on
plates
of
beaten
gold,
which
were
handed
unto
the
holy
Joseph
Smith
at
Palmyra.
We
have
come
from
Nauvoo,
in
the
State
of
Illinois,
where
we
had
founded
our
temple.
We
have
come
to
seek
a
refuge
from
the
violent
man
and
from
the
godless,
even
though
it
be
the
heart
of
the
desert."
The
name
of
Nauvoo
evidently
recalled
recollections
to
John
Ferrier.
"I
see,"
he
said,
"you
are
the
Mormons."
"We
are
the
Mormons,"
answered
his
companions
with
one
voice.
"And
where
are
you
going?"
"We
do
not
know.
The
hand
of
God
is
leading
us
under
the
person
of
our
Prophet.
You
must
come
before
him.
He
shall
say
what
is
to
be
done
with
you."
They
had
reached
the
base
of
the
hill
by
this
time,
and
were
surrounded
by
crowds
of
the
pilgrims
pale
faced
meek
looking
women,
strong
laughing
children,
and
anxious
earnest
eyed
men.
Many
were
the
cries
of
astonishment
and
of
commiseration
which
arose
from
them
when
they
perceived
the
youth
of
one
of
the
strangers
and
the
destitution
of
the
other.
Their
escort
did
not
halt,
however,
but
pushed
on,
followed
by
a
great
crowd
of
Mormons,
until
they
reached
a
waggon,
which
was
conspicuous
for
its
great
size
and
for
the
gaudiness
and
smartness
of
its
appearance.
Six
horses
were
yoked
to
it,
whereas
the
others
were
furnished
with
two,
or,
at
most,
four
a
piece.
Beside
the
driver
there
sat
a
man
who
could
not
have
been
more
than
thirty
years
of
age,
but
whose
massive
head
and
resolute
expression
marked
him
as
a
leader.
He
was
reading
a
brown
backed
volume,
but
as
the
crowd
approached
he
laid
it
aside,
and
listened
attentively
to
an
account
of
the
episode.
Then
he
turned
to
the
two
castaways.
"If
we
take
you
with
us,"
he
said,
in
solemn
words,
"it
can
only
be
as
believers
in
our
own
creed.
We
shall
have
no
wolves
in
our
fold.
Better
far
that
your
bones
should
bleach
in
this
wilderness
than
that
you
should
prove
to
be
that
little
speck
of
decay
which
in
time
corrupts
the
whole
fruit.
Will
you
come
with
us
on
these
terms?"
"Guess
I'll
come
with
you
on
any
terms,"
said
Ferrier,
with
such
emphasis
that
the
grave
Elders
could
not
restrain
a
smile.
The
leader
alone
retained
his
stern,
impressive
expression.
"Take
him,
Brother
Stangerson,"
he
said,
"give
him
food
and
drink,
and
the
child
likewise.
Let
it
be
your
task
also
to
teach
him
our
holy
creed.
We
have
delayed
long
enough.
Forward!
On,
on
to
Zion!"
"On,
on
to
Zion!"
cried
the
crowd
of
Mormons,
and
the
words
rippled
down
the
long
caravan,
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
until
they
died
away
in
a
dull
murmur
in
the
far
distance.
With
a
cracking
of
whips
and
a
creaking
of
wheels
the
great
waggons
got
into
motion,
and
soon
the
whole
caravan
was
winding
along
once
more.
The
Elder
to
whose
care
the
two
waifs
had
been
committed,
led
them
to
his
waggon,
where
a
meal
was
already
awaiting
them.
"You
shall
remain
here,"
he
said.
"In
a
few
days
you
will
have
recovered
from
your
fatigues.
In
the
meantime,
remember
that
now
and
for
ever
you
are
of
our
religion.
Brigham
Young
has
said
it,
and
he
has
spoken
with
the
voice
of
Joseph
Smith,
which
is
the
voice
of
God."
THIS
is
not
the
place
to
commemorate
the
trials
and
privations
endured
by
the
immigrant
Mormons
before
they
came
to
their
final
haven.
From
the
shores
of
the
Mississippi
to
the
western
slopes
of
the
Rocky
Mountains
they
had
struggled
on
with
a
constancy
almost
unparalleled
in
history.
The
savage
man,
and
the
savage
beast,
hunger,
thirst,
fatigue,
and
disease
every
impediment
which
Nature
could
place
in
the
way,
had
all
been
overcome
with
Anglo
Saxon
tenacity.
Yet
the
long
journey
and
the
accumulated
terrors
had
shaken
the
hearts
of
the
stoutest
among
them.
There
was
not
one
who
did
not
sink
upon
his
knees
in
heartfelt
prayer
when
they
saw
the
broad
valley
of
Utah
bathed
in
the
sunlight
beneath
them,
and
learned
from
the
lips
of
their
leader
that
this
was
the
promised
land,
and
that
these
virgin
acres
were
to
be
theirs
for
evermore.
Young
speedily
proved
himself
to
be
a
skilful
administrator
as
well
as
a
resolute
chief.
Maps
were
drawn
and
charts
prepared,
in
which
the
future
city
was
sketched
out.
All
around
farms
were
apportioned
and
allotted
in
proportion
to
the
standing
of
each
individual.
The
tradesman
was
put
to
his
trade
and
the
artisan
to
his
calling.
In
the
town
streets
and
squares
sprang
up,
as
if
by
magic.
In
the
country
there
was
draining
and
hedging,
planting
and
clearing,
until
the
next
summer
saw
the
whole
country
golden
with
the
wheat
crop.
Everything
prospered
in
the
strange
settlement.
Above
all,
the
great
temple
which
they
had
erected
in
the
centre
of
the
city
grew
ever
taller
and
larger.
From
the
first
blush
of
dawn
until
the
closing
of
the
twilight,
the
clatter
of
the
hammer
and
the
rasp
of
the
saw
was
never
absent
from
the
monument
which
the
immigrants
erected
to
Him
who
had
led
them
safe
through
many
dangers.
The
two
castaways,
John
Ferrier
and
the
little
girl
who
had
shared
his
fortunes
and
had
been
adopted
as
his
daughter,
accompanied
the
Mormons
to
the
end
of
their
great
pilgrimage.
Little
Lucy
Ferrier
was
borne
along
pleasantly
enough
in
Elder
Stangerson's
waggon,
a
retreat
which
she
shared
with
the
Mormon's
three
wives
and
with
his
son,
a
headstrong
forward
boy
of
twelve.
Having
rallied,
with
the
elasticity
of
childhood,
from
the
shock
caused
by
her
mother's
death,
she
soon
became
a
pet
with
the
women,
and
reconciled
herself
to
this
new
life
in
her
moving
canvas
covered
home.
In
the
meantime
Ferrier
having
recovered
from
his
privations,
distinguished
himself
as
a
useful
guide
and
an
indefatigable
hunter.
So
rapidly
did
he
gain
the
esteem
of
his
new
companions,
that
when
they
reached
the
end
of
their
wanderings,
it
was
unanimously
agreed
that
he
should
be
provided
with
as
large
and
as
fertile
a
tract
of
land
as
any
of
the
settlers,
with
the
exception
of
Young
himself,
and
of
Stangerson,
Kemball,
Johnston,
and
Drebber,
who
were
the
four
principal
Elders.
On
the
farm
thus
acquired
John
Ferrier
built
himself
a
substantial
log
house,
which
received
so
many
additions
in
succeeding
years
that
it
grew
into
a
roomy
villa.
He
was
a
man
of
a
practical
turn
of
mind,
keen
in
his
dealings
and
skilful
with
his
hands.
His
iron
constitution
enabled
him
to
work
morning
and
evening
at
improving
and
tilling
his
lands.
Hence
it
came
about
that
his
farm
and
all
that
belonged
to
him
prospered
exceedingly.
In
three
years
he
was
better
off
than
his
neighbours,
in
six
he
was
well
to
do,
in
nine
he
was
rich,
and
in
twelve
there
were
not
half
a
dozen
men
in
the
whole
of
Salt
Lake
City
who
could
compare
with
him.
From
the
great
inland
sea
to
the
distant
Wahsatch
Mountains
there
was
no
name
better
known
than
that
of
John
Ferrier.
There
was
one
way
and
only
one
in
which
he
offended
the
susceptibilities
of
his
co
religionists.
No
argument
or
persuasion
could
ever
induce
him
to
set
up
a
female
establishment
after
the
manner
of
his
companions.
He
never
gave
reasons
for
this
persistent
refusal,
but
contented
himself
by
resolutely
and
inflexibly
adhering
to
his
determination.
There
were
some
who
accused
him
of
lukewarmness
in
his
adopted
religion,
and
others
who
put
it
down
to
greed
of
wealth
and
reluctance
to
incur
expense.
Others,
again,
spoke
of
some
early
love
affair,
and
of
a
fair
haired
girl
who
had
pined
away
on
the
shores
of
the
Atlantic.
Whatever
the
reason,
Ferrier
remained
strictly
celibate.
In
every
other
respect
he
conformed
to
the
religion
of
the
young
settlement,
and
gained
the
name
of
being
an
orthodox
and
straight
walking
man.
Lucy
Ferrier
grew
up
within
the
log
house,
and
assisted
her
adopted
father
in
all
his
undertakings.
The
keen
air
of
the
mountains
and
the
balsamic
odour
of
the
pine
trees
took
the
place
of
nurse
and
mother
to
the
young
girl.
As
year
succeeded
to
year
she
grew
taller
and
stronger,
her
cheek
more
rudy,
and
her
step
more
elastic.
Many
a
wayfarer
upon
the
high
road
which
ran
by
Ferrier's
farm
felt
long
forgotten
thoughts
revive
in
their
mind
as
they
watched
her
lithe
girlish
figure
tripping
through
the
wheatfields,
or
met
her
mounted
upon
her
father's
mustang,
and
managing
it
with
all
the
ease
and
grace
of
a
true
child
of
the
West.
So
the
bud
blossomed
into
a
flower,
and
the
year
which
saw
her
father
the
richest
of
the
farmers
left
her
as
fair
a
specimen
of
American
girlhood
as
could
be
found
in
the
whole
Pacific
slope.
It
was
not
the
father,
however,
who
first
discovered
that
the
child
had
developed
into
the
woman.
It
seldom
is
in
such
cases.
That
mysterious
change
is
too
subtle
and
too
gradual
to
be
measured
by
dates.
Least
of
all
does
the
maiden
herself
know
it
until
the
tone
of
a
voice
or
the
touch
of
a
hand
sets
her
heart
thrilling
within
her,
and
she
learns,
with
a
mixture
of
pride
and
of
fear,
that
a
new
and
a
larger
nature
has
awoken
within
her.
There
are
few
who
cannot
recall
that
day
and
remember
the
one
little
incident
which
heralded
the
dawn
of
a
new
life.
In
the
case
of
Lucy
Ferrier
the
occasion
was
serious
enough
in
itself,
apart
from
its
future
influence
on
her
destiny
and
that
of
many
besides.
It
was
a
warm
June
morning,
and
the
Latter
Day
Saints
were
as
busy
as
the
bees
whose
hive
they
have
chosen
for
their
emblem.
In
the
fields
and
in
the
streets
rose
the
same
hum
of
human
industry.
Down
the
dusty
high
roads
defiled
long
streams
of
heavily
laden
mules,
all
heading
to
the
west,
for
the
gold
fever
had
broken
out
in
California,
and
the
Overland
Route
lay
through
the
City
of
the
Elect.
There,
too,
were
droves
of
sheep
and
bullocks
coming
in
from
the
outlying
pasture
lands,
and
trains
of
tired
immigrants,
men
and
horses
equally
weary
of
their
interminable
journey.
Through
all
this
motley
assemblage,
threading
her
way
with
the
skill
of
an
accomplished
rider,
there
galloped
Lucy
Ferrier,
her
fair
face
flushed
with
the
exercise
and
her
long
chestnut
hair
floating
out
behind
her.
She
had
a
commission
from
her
father
in
the
City,
and
was
dashing
in
as
she
had
done
many
a
time
before,
with
all
the
fearlessness
of
youth,
thinking
only
of
her
task
and
how
it
was
to
be
performed.
The
travel
stained
adventurers
gazed
after
her
in
astonishment,
and
even
the
unemotional
Indians,
journeying
in
with
their
pelties,
relaxed
their
accustomed
stoicism
as
they
marvelled
at
the
beauty
of
the
pale
faced
maiden.
She
had
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
city
when
she
found
the
road
blocked
by
a
great
drove
of
cattle,
driven
by
a
half
dozen
wild
looking
herdsmen
from
the
plains.
In
her
impatience
she
endeavoured
to
pass
this
obstacle
by
pushing
her
horse
into
what
appeared
to
be
a
gap.
Scarcely
had
she
got
fairly
into
it,
however,
before
the
beasts
closed
in
behind
her,
and
she
found
herself
completely
imbedded
in
the
moving
stream
of
fierce
eyed,
long
horned
bullocks.
Accustomed
as
she
was
to
deal
with
cattle,
she
was
not
alarmed
at
her
situation,
but
took
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
urge
her
horse
on
in
the
hopes
of
pushing
her
way
through
the
cavalcade.
Unfortunately
the
horns
of
one
of
the
creatures,
either
by
accident
or
design,
came
in
violent
contact
with
the
flank
of
the
mustang,
and
excited
it
to
madness.
In
an
instant
it
reared
up
upon
its
hind
legs
with
a
snort
of
rage,
and
pranced
and
tossed
in
a
way
that
would
have
unseated
any
but
a
most
skilful
rider.
The
situation
was
full
of
peril.
Every
plunge
of
the
excited
horse
brought
it
against
the
horns
again,
and
goaded
it
to
fresh
madness.
It
was
all
that
the
girl
could
do
to
keep
herself
in
the
saddle,
yet
a
slip
would
mean
a
terrible
death
under
the
hoofs
of
the
unwieldy
and
terrified
animals.
Unaccustomed
to
sudden
emergencies,
her
head
began
to
swim,
and
her
grip
upon
the
bridle
to
relax.
Choked
by
the
rising
cloud
of
dust
and
by
the
steam
from
the
struggling
creatures,
she
might
have
abandoned
her
efforts
in
despair,
but
for
a
kindly
voice
at
her
elbow
which
assured
her
of
assistance.
At
the
same
moment
a
sinewy
brown
hand
caught
the
frightened
horse
by
the
curb,
and
forcing
a
way
through
the
drove,
soon
brought
her
to
the
outskirts.
"You're
not
hurt,
I
hope,
miss,"
said
her
preserver,
respectfully.
She
looked
up
at
his
dark,
fierce
face,
and
laughed
saucily.
"I'm
awful
frightened,"
she
said,
naively;
"whoever
would
have
thought
that
Poncho
would
have
been
so
scared
by
a
lot
of
cows?"
"Thank
God
you
kept
your
seat,"
the
other
said
earnestly.
He
was
a
tall,
savage
looking
young
fellow,
mounted
on
a
powerful
roan
horse,
and
clad
in
the
rough
dress
of
a
hunter,
with
a
long
rifle
slung
over
his
shoulders.
"I
guess
you
are
the
daughter
of
John
Ferrier,"
he
remarked,
"I
saw
you
ride
down
from
his
house.
When
you
see
him,
ask
him
if
he
remembers
the
Jefferson
Hopes
of
St.
Louis.
If
he's
the
same
Ferrier,
my
father
and
he
were
pretty
thick."
"Hadn't
you
better
come
and
ask
yourself?"
she
asked,
demurely.
The
young
fellow
seemed
pleased
at
the
suggestion,
and
his
dark
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure.
"I'll
do
so,"
he
said,
"we've
been
in
the
mountains
for
two
months,
and
are
not
over
and
above
in
visiting
condition.
He
must
take
us
as
he
finds
us."
"He
has
a
good
deal
to
thank
you
for,
and
so
have
I,"
she
answered,
"he's
awful
fond
of
me.
If
those
cows
had
jumped
on
me
he'd
have
never
got
over
it."
"Neither
would
I,"
said
her
companion.
"You!
Well,
I
don't
see
that
it
would
make
much
matter
to
you,
anyhow.
You
ain't
even
a
friend
of
ours."
The
young
hunter's
dark
face
grew
so
gloomy
over
this
remark
that
Lucy
Ferrier
laughed
aloud.
"There,
I
didn't
mean
that,"
she
said;
"of
course,
you
are
a
friend
now.
You
must
come
and
see
us.
Now
I
must
push
along,
or
father
won't
trust
me
with
his
business
any
more.
Good
bye!"
"Good
bye,"
he
answered,
raising
his
broad
sombrero,
and
bending
over
her
little
hand.
She
wheeled
her
mustang
round,
gave
it
a
cut
with
her
riding
whip,
and
darted
away
down
the
broad
road
in
a
rolling
cloud
of
dust.
Young
Jefferson
Hope
rode
on
with
his
companions,
gloomy
and
taciturn.
He
and
they
had
been
among
the
Nevada
Mountains
prospecting
for
silver,
and
were
returning
to
Salt
Lake
City
in
the
hope
of
raising
capital
enough
to
work
some
lodes
which
they
had
discovered.
He
had
been
as
keen
as
any
of
them
upon
the
business
until
this
sudden
incident
had
drawn
his
thoughts
into
another
channel.
The
sight
of
the
fair
young
girl,
as
frank
and
wholesome
as
the
Sierra
breezes,
had
stirred
his
volcanic,
untamed
heart
to
its
very
depths.
When
she
had
vanished
from
his
sight,
he
realized
that
a
crisis
had
come
in
his
life,
and
that
neither
silver
speculations
nor
any
other
questions
could
ever
be
of
such
importance
to
him
as
this
new
and
all
absorbing
one.
The
love
which
had
sprung
up
in
his
heart
was
not
the
sudden,
changeable
fancy
of
a
boy,
but
rather
the
wild,
fierce
passion
of
a
man
of
strong
will
and
imperious
temper.
He
had
been
accustomed
to
succeed
in
all
that
he
undertook.
He
swore
in
his
heart
that
he
would
not
fail
in
this
if
human
effort
and
human
perseverance
could
render
him
successful.
He
called
on
John
Ferrier
that
night,
and
many
times
again,
until
his
face
was
a
familiar
one
at
the
farm
house.
John,
cooped
up
in
the
valley,
and
absorbed
in
his
work,
had
had
little
chance
of
learning
the
news
of
the
outside
world
during
the
last
twelve
years.
All
this
Jefferson
Hope
was
able
to
tell
him,
and
in
a
style
which
interested
Lucy
as
well
as
her
father.
He
had
been
a
pioneer
in
California,
and
could
narrate
many
a
strange
tale
of
fortunes
made
and
fortunes
lost
in
those
wild,
halcyon
days.
He
had
been
a
scout
too,
and
a
trapper,
a
silver
explorer,
and
a
ranchman.
Wherever
stirring
adventures
were
to
be
had,
Jefferson
Hope
had
been
there
in
search
of
them.
He
soon
became
a
favourite
with
the
old
farmer,
who
spoke
eloquently
of
his
virtues.
On
such
occasions,
Lucy
was
silent,
but
her
blushing
cheek
and
her
bright,
happy
eyes,
showed
only
too
clearly
that
her
young
heart
was
no
longer
her
own.
Her
honest
father
may
not
have
observed
these
symptoms,
but
they
were
assuredly
not
thrown
away
upon
the
man
who
had
won
her
affections.
It
was
a
summer
evening
when
he
came
galloping
down
the
road
and
pulled
up
at
the
gate.
She
was
at
the
doorway,
and
came
down
to
meet
him.
He
threw
the
bridle
over
the
fence
and
strode
up
the
pathway.
"I
am
off,
Lucy,"
he
said,
taking
her
two
hands
in
his,
and
gazing
tenderly
down
into
her
face;
"I
won't
ask
you
to
come
with
me
now,
but
will
you
be
ready
to
come
when
I
am
here
again?"
"And
when
will
that
be?"
she
asked,
blushing
and
laughing.
"A
couple
of
months
at
the
outside.
I
will
come
and
claim
you
then,
my
darling.
There's
no
one
who
can
stand
between
us."
"And
how
about
father?"
she
asked.
"He
has
given
his
consent,
provided
we
get
these
mines
working
all
right.
I
have
no
fear
on
that
head."
"Oh,
well;
of
course,
if
you
and
father
have
arranged
it
all,
there's
no
more
to
be
said,"
she
whispered,
with
her
cheek
against
his
broad
breast.
"Thank
God!"
he
said,
hoarsely,
stooping
and
kissing
her.
"It
is
settled,
then.
The
longer
I
stay,
the
harder
it
will
be
to
go.
They
are
waiting
for
me
at
the
canon.
Good
bye,
my
own
darling
good
bye.
In
two
months
you
shall
see
me."
He
tore
himself
from
her
as
he
spoke,
and,
flinging
himself
upon
his
horse,
galloped
furiously
away,
never
even
looking
round,
as
though
afraid
that
his
resolution
might
fail
him
if
he
took
one
glance
at
what
he
was
leaving.
She
stood
at
the
gate,
gazing
after
him
until
he
vanished
from
her
sight.
Then
she
walked
back
into
the
house,
the
happiest
girl
in
all
Utah.
THREE
weeks
had
passed
since
Jefferson
Hope
and
his
comrades
had
departed
from
Salt
Lake
City.
John
Ferrier's
heart
was
sore
within
him
when
he
thought
of
the
young
man's
return,
and
of
the
impending
loss
of
his
adopted
child.
Yet
her
bright
and
happy
face
reconciled
him
to
the
arrangement
more
than
any
argument
could
have
done.
He
had
always
determined,
deep
down
in
his
resolute
heart,
that
nothing
would
ever
induce
him
to
allow
his
daughter
to
wed
a
Mormon.
Such
a
marriage
he
regarded
as
no
marriage
at
all,
but
as
a
shame
and
a
disgrace.
Whatever
he
might
think
of
the
Mormon
doctrines,
upon
that
one
point
he
was
inflexible.
He
had
to
seal
his
mouth
on
the
subject,
however,
for
to
express
an
unorthodox
opinion
was
a
dangerous
matter
in
those
days
in
the
Land
of
the
Saints.
Yes,
a
dangerous
matter
so
dangerous
that
even
the
most
saintly
dared
only
whisper
their
religious
opinions
with
bated
breath,
lest
something
which
fell
from
their
lips
might
be
misconstrued,
and
bring
down
a
swift
retribution
upon
them.
The
victims
of
persecution
had
now
turned
persecutors
on
their
own
account,
and
persecutors
of
the
most
terrible
description.
Not
the
Inquisition
of
Seville,
nor
the
German
Vehm
gericht,
nor
the
Secret
Societies
of
Italy,
were
ever
able
to
put
a
more
formidable
machinery
in
motion
than
that
which
cast
a
cloud
over
the
State
of
Utah.
Its
invisibility,
and
the
mystery
which
was
attached
to
it,
made
this
organization
doubly
terrible.
It
appeared
to
be
omniscient
and
omnipotent,
and
yet
was
neither
seen
nor
heard.
The
man
who
held
out
against
the
Church
vanished
away,
and
none
knew
whither
he
had
gone
or
what
had
befallen
him.
His
wife
and
his
children
awaited
him
at
home,
but
no
father
ever
returned
to
tell
them
how
he
had
fared
at
the
hands
of
his
secret
judges.
A
rash
word
or
a
hasty
act
was
followed
by
annihilation,
and
yet
none
knew
what
the
nature
might
be
of
this
terrible
power
which
was
suspended
over
them.
No
wonder
that
men
went
about
in
fear
and
trembling,
and
that
even
in
the
heart
of
the
wilderness
they
dared
not
whisper
the
doubts
which
oppressed
them.
At
first
this
vague
and
terrible
power
was
exercised
only
upon
the
recalcitrants
who,
having
embraced
the
Mormon
faith,
wished
afterwards
to
pervert
or
to
abandon
it.
Soon,
however,
it
took
a
wider
range.
The
supply
of
adult
women
was
running
short,
and
polygamy
without
a
female
population
on
which
to
draw
was
a
barren
doctrine
indeed.
Strange
rumours
began
to
be
bandied
about
rumours
of
murdered
immigrants
and
rifled
camps
in
regions
where
Indians
had
never
been
seen.
Fresh
women
appeared
in
the
harems
of
the
Elders
women
who
pined
and
wept,
and
bore
upon
their
faces
the
traces
of
an
unextinguishable
horror.
Belated
wanderers
upon
the
mountains
spoke
of
gangs
of
armed
men,
masked,
stealthy,
and
noiseless,
who
flitted
by
them
in
the
darkness.
These
tales
and
rumours
took
substance
and
shape,
and
were
corroborated
and
re
corroborated,
until
they
resolved
themselves
into
a
definite
name.
To
this
day,
in
the
lonely
ranches
of
the
West,
the
name
of
the
Danite
Band,
or
the
Avenging
Angels,
is
a
sinister
and
an
ill
omened
one.
Fuller
knowledge
of
the
organization
which
produced
such
terrible
results
served
to
increase
rather
than
to
lessen
the
horror
which
it
inspired
in
the
minds
of
men.
None
knew
who
belonged
to
this
ruthless
society.
The
names
of
the
participators
in
the
deeds
of
blood
and
violence
done
under
the
name
of
religion
were
kept
profoundly
secret.
The
very
friend
to
whom
you
communicated
your
misgivings
as
to
the
Prophet
and
his
mission,
might
be
one
of
those
who
would
come
forth
at
night
with
fire
and
sword
to
exact
a
terrible
reparation.
Hence
every
man
feared
his
neighbour,
and
none
spoke
of
the
things
which
were
nearest
his
heart.
One
fine
morning,
John
Ferrier
was
about
to
set
out
to
his
wheatfields,
when
he
heard
the
click
of
the
latch,
and,
looking
through
the
window,
saw
a
stout,
sandy
haired,
middle
aged
man
coming
up
the
pathway.
His
heart
leapt
to
his
mouth,
for
this
was
none
other
than
the
great
Brigham
Young
himself.
Full
of
trepidation
for
he
knew
that
such
a
visit
boded
him
little
good
Ferrier
ran
to
the
door
to
greet
the
Mormon
chief.
The
latter,
however,
received
his
salutations
coldly,
and
followed
him
with
a
stern
face
into
the
sitting
room.
"Brother
Ferrier,"
he
said,
taking
a
seat,
and
eyeing
the
farmer
keenly
from
under
his
light
coloured
eyelashes,
"the
true
believers
have
been
good
friends
to
you.
We
picked
you
up
when
you
were
starving
in
the
desert,
we
shared
our
food
with
you,
led
you
safe
to
the
Chosen
Valley,
gave
you
a
goodly
share
of
land,
and
allowed
you
to
wax
rich
under
our
protection.
Is
not
this
so?"
"It
is
so,"
answered
John
Ferrier.
"In
return
for
all
this
we
asked
but
one
condition:
that
was,
that
you
should
embrace
the
true
faith,
and
conform
in
every
way
to
its
usages.
This
you
promised
to
do,
and
this,
if
common
report
says
truly,
you
have
neglected."
"And
how
have
I
neglected
it?"
asked
Ferrier,
throwing
out
his
hands
in
expostulation.
"Have
I
not
given
to
the
common
fund?
Have
I
not
attended
at
the
Temple?
Have
I
not
?"
"Where
are
your
wives?"
asked
Young,
looking
round
him.
"Call
them
in,
that
I
may
greet
them."
"It
is
true
that
I
have
not
married,"
Ferrier
answered.
"But
women
were
few,
and
there
were
many
who
had
better
claims
than
I.
I
was
not
a
lonely
man:
I
had
my
daughter
to
attend
to
my
wants."
"It
is
of
that
daughter
that
I
would
speak
to
you,"
said
the
leader
of
the
Mormons.
"She
has
grown
to
be
the
flower
of
Utah,
and
has
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
many
who
are
high
in
the
land."
John
Ferrier
groaned
internally.
"There
are
stories
of
her
which
I
would
fain
disbelieve
stories
that
she
is
sealed
to
some
Gentile.
This
must
be
the
gossip
of
idle
tongues.
What
is
the
thirteenth
rule
in
the
code
of
the
sainted
Joseph
Smith?
'Let
every
maiden
of
the
true
faith
marry
one
of
the
elect;
for
if
she
wed
a
Gentile,
she
commits
a
grievous
sin.'
This
being
so,
it
is
impossible
that
you,
who
profess
the
holy
creed,
should
suffer
your
daughter
to
violate
it."
John
Ferrier
made
no
answer,
but
he
played
nervously
with
his
riding
whip.
"Upon
this
one
point
your
whole
faith
shall
be
tested
so
it
has
been
decided
in
the
Sacred
Council
of
Four.
The
girl
is
young,
and
we
would
not
have
her
wed
grey
hairs,
neither
would
we
deprive
her
of
all
choice.
We
Elders
have
many
heifers,
but
our
children
must
also
be
provided.
Stangerson
has
a
son,
and
Drebber
has
a
son,
and
either
of
them
would
gladly
welcome
your
daughter
to
their
house.
Let
her
choose
between
them.
They
are
young
and
rich,
and
of
the
true
faith.
What
say
you
to
that?"
Ferrier
remained
silent
for
some
little
time
with
his
brows
knitted.
"You
will
give
us
time,"
he
said
at
last.
"My
daughter
is
very
young
she
is
scarce
of
an
age
to
marry."
"She
shall
have
a
month
to
choose,"
said
Young,
rising
from
his
seat.
"At
the
end
of
that
time
she
shall
give
her
answer."
He
was
passing
through
the
door,
when
he
turned,
with
flushed
face
and
flashing
eyes.
"It
were
better
for
you,
John
Ferrier,"
he
thundered,
"that
you
and
she
were
now
lying
blanched
skeletons
upon
the
Sierra
Blanco,
than
that
you
should
put
your
weak
wills
against
the
orders
of
the
Holy
Four!"
With
a
threatening
gesture
of
his
hand,
he
turned
from
the
door,
and
Ferrier
heard
his
heavy
step
scrunching
along
the
shingly
path.
He
was
still
sitting
with
his
elbows
upon
his
knees,
considering
how
he
should
broach
the
matter
to
his
daughter
when
a
soft
hand
was
laid
upon
his,
and
looking
up,
he
saw
her
standing
beside
him.
One
glance
at
her
pale,
frightened
face
showed
him
that
she
had
heard
what
had
passed.
"I
could
not
help
it,"
she
said,
in
answer
to
his
look.
"His
voice
rang
through
the
house.
Oh,
father,
father,
what
shall
we
do?"
"Don't
you
scare
yourself,"
he
answered,
drawing
her
to
him,
and
passing
his
broad,
rough
hand
caressingly
over
her
chestnut
hair.
"We'll
fix
it
up
somehow
or
another.
You
don't
find
your
fancy
kind
o'
lessening
for
this
chap,
do
you?"
A
sob
and
a
squeeze
of
his
hand
was
her
only
answer.
"No;
of
course
not.
I
shouldn't
care
to
hear
you
say
you
did.
He's
a
likely
lad,
and
he's
a
Christian,
which
is
more
than
these
folk
here,
in
spite
o'
all
their
praying
and
preaching.
There's
a
party
starting
for
Nevada
to
morrow,
and
I'll
manage
to
send
him
a
message
letting
him
know
the
hole
we
are
in.
If
I
know
anything
o'
that
young
man,
he'll
be
back
here
with
a
speed
that
would
whip
electro
telegraphs."
Lucy
laughed
through
her
tears
at
her
father's
description.
"When
he
comes,
he
will
advise
us
for
the
best.
But
it
is
for
you
that
I
am
frightened,
dear.
One
hears
one
hears
such
dreadful
stories
about
those
who
oppose
the
Prophet:
something
terrible
always
happens
to
them."
"But
we
haven't
opposed
him
yet,"
her
father
answered.
"It
will
be
time
to
look
out
for
squalls
when
we
do.
We
have
a
clear
month
before
us;
at
the
end
of
that,
I
guess
we
had
best
shin
out
of
Utah."
"Leave
Utah!"
"That's
about
the
size
of
it."
"But
the
farm?"
"We
will
raise
as
much
as
we
can
in
money,
and
let
the
rest
go.
To
tell
the
truth,
Lucy,
it
isn't
the
first
time
I
have
thought
of
doing
it.
I
don't
care
about
knuckling
under
to
any
man,
as
these
folk
do
to
their
darned
prophet.
I'm
a
free
born
American,
and
it's
all
new
to
me.
Guess
I'm
too
old
to
learn.
If
he
comes
browsing
about
this
farm,
he
might
chance
to
run
up
against
a
charge
of
buckshot
travelling
in
the
opposite
direction."
"But
they
won't
let
us
leave,"
his
daughter
objected.
"Wait
till
Jefferson
comes,
and
we'll
soon
manage
that.
In
the
meantime,
don't
you
fret
yourself,
my
dearie,
and
don't
get
your
eyes
swelled
up,
else
he'll
be
walking
into
me
when
he
sees
you.
There's
nothing
to
be
afeared
about,
and
there's
no
danger
at
all."
John
Ferrier
uttered
these
consoling
remarks
in
a
very
confident
tone,
but
she
could
not
help
observing
that
he
paid
unusual
care
to
the
fastening
of
the
doors
that
night,
and
that
he
carefully
cleaned
and
loaded
the
rusty
old
shotgun
which
hung
upon
the
wall
of
his
bedroom.
ON
the
morning
which
followed
his
interview
with
the
Mormon
Prophet,
John
Ferrier
went
in
to
Salt
Lake
City,
and
having
found
his
acquaintance,
who
was
bound
for
the
Nevada
Mountains,
he
entrusted
him
with
his
message
to
Jefferson
Hope.
In
it
he
told
the
young
man
of
the
imminent
danger
which
threatened
them,
and
how
necessary
it
was
that
he
should
return.
Having
done
thus
he
felt
easier
in
his
mind,
and
returned
home
with
a
lighter
heart.
As
he
approached
his
farm,
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
horse
hitched
to
each
of
the
posts
of
the
gate.
Still
more
surprised
was
he
on
entering
to
find
two
young
men
in
possession
of
his
sitting
room.
One,
with
a
long
pale
face,
was
leaning
back
in
the
rocking
chair,
with
his
feet
cocked
up
upon
the
stove.
The
other,
a
bull
necked
youth
with
coarse
bloated
features,
was
standing
in
front
of
the
window
with
his
hands
in
his
pocket,
whistling
a
popular
hymn.
Both
of
them
nodded
to
Ferrier
as
he
entered,
and
the
one
in
the
rocking
chair
commenced
the
conversation.
"Maybe
you
don't
know
us,"
he
said.
"This
here
is
the
son
of
Elder
Drebber,
and
I'm
Joseph
Stangerson,
who
travelled
with
you
in
the
desert
when
the
Lord
stretched
out
His
hand
and
gathered
you
into
the
true
fold."
"As
He
will
all
the
nations
in
His
own
good
time,"
said
the
other
in
a
nasal
voice;
"He
grindeth
slowly
but
exceeding
small."
John
Ferrier
bowed
coldly.
He
had
guessed
who
his
visitors
were.
"We
have
come,"
continued
Stangerson,
"at
the
advice
of
our
fathers
to
solicit
the
hand
of
your
daughter
for
whichever
of
us
may
seem
good
to
you
and
to
her.
As
I
have
but
four
wives
and
Brother
Drebber
here
has
seven,
it
appears
to
me
that
my
claim
is
the
stronger
one."
"Nay,
nay,
Brother
Stangerson,"
cried
the
other;
"the
question
is
not
how
many
wives
we
have,
but
how
many
we
can
keep.
My
father
has
now
given
over
his
mills
to
me,
and
I
am
the
richer
man."
"But
my
prospects
are
better,"
said
the
other,
warmly.
"When
the
Lord
removes
my
father,
I
shall
have
his
tanning
yard
and
his
leather
factory.
Then
I
am
your
elder,
and
am
higher
in
the
Church."
"It
will
be
for
the
maiden
to
decide,"
rejoined
young
Drebber,
smirking
at
his
own
reflection
in
the
glass.
"We
will
leave
it
all
to
her
decision."
During
this
dialogue,
John
Ferrier
had
stood
fuming
in
the
doorway,
hardly
able
to
keep
his
riding
whip
from
the
backs
of
his
two
visitors.
"Look
here,"
he
said
at
last,
striding
up
to
them,
"when
my
daughter
summons
you,
you
can
come,
but
until
then
I
don't
want
to
see
your
faces
again."
The
two
young
Mormons
stared
at
him
in
amazement.
In
their
eyes
this
competition
between
them
for
the
maiden's
hand
was
the
highest
of
honours
both
to
her
and
her
father.
"There
are
two
ways
out
of
the
room,"
cried
Ferrier;
"there
is
the
door,
and
there
is
the
window.
Which
do
you
care
to
use?"
His
brown
face
looked
so
savage,
and
his
gaunt
hands
so
threatening,
that
his
visitors
sprang
to
their
feet
and
beat
a
hurried
retreat.
The
old
farmer
followed
them
to
the
door.
"Let
me
know
when
you
have
settled
which
it
is
to
be,"
he
said,
sardonically.
"You
shall
smart
for
this!"
Stangerson
cried,
white
with
rage.
"You
have
defied
the
Prophet
and
the
Council
of
Four.
You
shall
rue
it
to
the
end
of
your
days."
"The
hand
of
the
Lord
shall
be
heavy
upon
you,"
cried
young
Drebber;
"He
will
arise
and
smite
you!"
"Then
I'll
start
the
smiting,"
exclaimed
Ferrier
furiously,
and
would
have
rushed
upstairs
for
his
gun
had
not
Lucy
seized
him
by
the
arm
and
restrained
him.
Before
he
could
escape
from
her,
the
clatter
of
horses'
hoofs
told
him
that
they
were
beyond
his
reach.
"The
young
canting
rascals!"
he
exclaimed,
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead;
"I
would
sooner
see
you
in
your
grave,
my
girl,
than
the
wife
of
either
of
them."
"And
so
should
I,
father,"
she
answered,
with
spirit;
"but
Jefferson
will
soon
be
here."
"Yes.
It
will
not
be
long
before
he
comes.
The
sooner
the
better,
for
we
do
not
know
what
their
next
move
may
be."
It
was,
indeed,
high
time
that
someone
capable
of
giving
advice
and
help
should
come
to
the
aid
of
the
sturdy
old
farmer
and
his
adopted
daughter.
In
the
whole
history
of
the
settlement
there
had
never
been
such
a
case
of
rank
disobedience
to
the
authority
of
the
Elders.
If
minor
errors
were
punished
so
sternly,
what
would
be
the
fate
of
this
arch
rebel.
Ferrier
knew
that
his
wealth
and
position
would
be
of
no
avail
to
him.
Others
as
well
known
and
as
rich
as
himself
had
been
spirited
away
before
now,
and
their
goods
given
over
to
the
Church.
He
was
a
brave
man,
but
he
trembled
at
the
vague,
shadowy
terrors
which
hung
over
him.
Any
known
danger
he
could
face
with
a
firm
lip,
but
this
suspense
was
unnerving.
He
concealed
his
fears
from
his
daughter,
however,
and
affected
to
make
light
of
the
whole
matter,
though
she,
with
the
keen
eye
of
love,
saw
plainly
that
he
was
ill
at
ease.
He
expected
that
he
would
receive
some
message
or
remonstrance
from
Young
as
to
his
conduct,
and
he
was
not
mistaken,
though
it
came
in
an
unlooked
for
manner.
Upon
rising
next
morning
he
found,
to
his
surprise,
a
small
square
of
paper
pinned
on
to
the
coverlet
of
his
bed
just
over
his
chest.
On
it
was
printed,
in
bold
straggling
letters:
"Twenty
nine
days
are
given
you
for
amendment,
and
then
"
The
dash
was
more
fear
inspiring
than
any
threat
could
have
been.
How
this
warning
came
into
his
room
puzzled
John
Ferrier
sorely,
for
his
servants
slept
in
an
outhouse,
and
the
doors
and
windows
had
all
been
secured.
He
crumpled
the
paper
up
and
said
nothing
to
his
daughter,
but
the
incident
struck
a
chill
into
his
heart.
The
twenty
nine
days
were
evidently
the
balance
of
the
month
which
Young
had
promised.
What
strength
or
courage
could
avail
against
an
enemy
armed
with
such
mysterious
powers?
The
hand
which
fastened
that
pin
might
have
struck
him
to
the
heart,
and
he
could
never
have
known
who
had
slain
him.
Still
more
shaken
was
he
next
morning.
They
had
sat
down
to
their
breakfast
when
Lucy
with
a
cry
of
surprise
pointed
upwards.
In
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
was
scrawled,
with
a
burned
stick
apparently,
the
number
28.
To
his
daughter
it
was
unintelligible,
and
he
did
not
enlighten
her.
That
night
he
sat
up
with
his
gun
and
kept
watch
and
ward.
He
saw
and
he
heard
nothing,
and
yet
in
the
morning
a
great
27
had
been
painted
upon
the
outside
of
his
door.
Thus
day
followed
day;
and
as
sure
as
morning
came
he
found
that
his
unseen
enemies
had
kept
their
register,
and
had
marked
up
in
some
conspicuous
position
how
many
days
were
still
left
to
him
out
of
the
month
of
grace.
Sometimes
the
fatal
numbers
appeared
upon
the
walls,
sometimes
upon
the
floors,
occasionally
they
were
on
small
placards
stuck
upon
the
garden
gate
or
the
railings.
With
all
his
vigilance
John
Ferrier
could
not
discover
whence
these
daily
warnings
proceeded.
A
horror
which
was
almost
superstitious
came
upon
him
at
the
sight
of
them.
He
became
haggard
and
restless,
and
his
eyes
had
the
troubled
look
of
some
hunted
creature.
He
had
but
one
hope
in
life
now,
and
that
was
for
the
arrival
of
the
young
hunter
from
Nevada.
Twenty
had
changed
to
fifteen
and
fifteen
to
ten,
but
there
was
no
news
of
the
absentee.
One
by
one
the
numbers
dwindled
down,
and
still
there
came
no
sign
of
him.
Whenever
a
horseman
clattered
down
the
road,
or
a
driver
shouted
at
his
team,
the
old
farmer
hurried
to
the
gate
thinking
that
help
had
arrived
at
last.
At
last,
when
he
saw
five
give
way
to
four
and
that
again
to
three,
he
lost
heart,
and
abandoned
all
hope
of
escape.
Single
handed,
and
with
his
limited
knowledge
of
the
mountains
which
surrounded
the
settlement,
he
knew
that
he
was
powerless.
The
more
frequented
roads
were
strictly
watched
and
guarded,
and
none
could
pass
along
them
without
an
order
from
the
Council.
Turn
which
way
he
would,
there
appeared
to
be
no
avoiding
the
blow
which
hung
over
him.
Yet
the
old
man
never
wavered
in
his
resolution
to
part
with
life
itself
before
he
consented
to
what
he
regarded
as
his
daughter's
dishonour.
He
was
sitting
alone
one
evening
pondering
deeply
over
his
troubles,
and
searching
vainly
for
some
way
out
of
them.
That
morning
had
shown
the
figure
2
upon
the
wall
of
his
house,
and
the
next
day
would
be
the
last
of
the
allotted
time.
What
was
to
happen
then?
All
manner
of
vague
and
terrible
fancies
filled
his
imagination.
And
his
daughter
what
was
to
become
of
her
after
he
was
gone?
Was
there
no
escape
from
the
invisible
network
which
was
drawn
all
round
them.
He
sank
his
head
upon
the
table
and
sobbed
at
the
thought
of
his
own
impotence.
What
was
that?
In
the
silence
he
heard
a
gentle
scratching
sound
low,
but
very
distinct
in
the
quiet
of
the
night.
It
came
from
the
door
of
the
house.
Ferrier
crept
into
the
hall
and
listened
intently.
There
was
a
pause
for
a
few
moments,
and
then
the
low
insidious
sound
was
repeated.
Someone
was
evidently
tapping
very
gently
upon
one
of
the
panels
of
the
door.
Was
it
some
midnight
assassin
who
had
come
to
carry
out
the
murderous
orders
of
the
secret
tribunal?
Or
was
it
some
agent
who
was
marking
up
that
the
last
day
of
grace
had
arrived.
John
Ferrier
felt
that
instant
death
would
be
better
than
the
suspense
which
shook
his
nerves
and
chilled
his
heart.
Springing
forward
he
drew
the
bolt
and
threw
the
door
open.
Outside
all
was
calm
and
quiet.
The
night
was
fine,
and
the
stars
were
twinkling
brightly
overhead.
The
little
front
garden
lay
before
the
farmer's
eyes
bounded
by
the
fence
and
gate,
but
neither
there
nor
on
the
road
was
any
human
being
to
be
seen.
With
a
sigh
of
relief,
Ferrier
looked
to
right
and
to
left,
until
happening
to
glance
straight
down
at
his
own
feet
he
saw
to
his
astonishment
a
man
lying
flat
upon
his
face
upon
the
ground,
with
arms
and
legs
all
asprawl.
So
unnerved
was
he
at
the
sight
that
he
leaned
up
against
the
wall
with
his
hand
to
his
throat
to
stifle
his
inclination
to
call
out.
His
first
thought
was
that
the
prostrate
figure
was
that
of
some
wounded
or
dying
man,
but
as
he
watched
it
he
saw
it
writhe
along
the
ground
and
into
the
hall
with
the
rapidity
and
noiselessness
of
a
serpent.
Once
within
the
house
the
man
sprang
to
his
feet,
closed
the
door,
and
revealed
to
the
astonished
farmer
the
fierce
face
and
resolute
expression
of
Jefferson
Hope.
"Good
God!"
gasped
John
Ferrier.
"How
you
scared
me!
Whatever
made
you
come
in
like
that."
"Give
me
food,"
the
other
said,
hoarsely.
"I
have
had
no
time
for
bite
or
sup
for
eight
and
forty
hours."
He
flung
himself
upon
the
cold
meat
and
bread
which
were
still
lying
upon
the
table
from
his
host's
supper,
and
devoured
it
voraciously.
"Does
Lucy
bear
up
well?"
he
asked,
when
he
had
satisfied
his
hunger.
"Yes.
She
does
not
know
the
danger,"
her
father
answered.
"That
is
well.
The
house
is
watched
on
every
side.
That
is
why
I
crawled
my
way
up
to
it.
They
may
be
darned
sharp,
but
they're
not
quite
sharp
enough
to
catch
a
Washoe
hunter."
John
Ferrier
felt
a
different
man
now
that
he
realized
that
he
had
a
devoted
ally.
He
seized
the
young
man's
leathery
hand
and
wrung
it
cordially.
"You're
a
man
to
be
proud
of,"
he
said.
"There
are
not
many
who
would
come
to
share
our
danger
and
our
troubles."
"You've
hit
it
there,
pard,"
the
young
hunter
answered.
"I
have
a
respect
for
you,
but
if
you
were
alone
in
this
business
I'd
think
twice
before
I
put
my
head
into
such
a
hornet's
nest.
It's
Lucy
that
brings
me
here,
and
before
harm
comes
on
her
I
guess
there
will
be
one
less
o'
the
Hope
family
in
Utah."
"What
are
we
to
do?"
"To
morrow
is
your
last
day,
and
unless
you
act
to
night
you
are
lost.
I
have
a
mule
and
two
horses
waiting
in
the
Eagle
Ravine.
How
much
money
have
you?"
"Two
thousand
dollars
in
gold,
and
five
in
notes."
"That
will
do.
I
have
as
much
more
to
add
to
it.
We
must
push
for
Carson
City
through
the
mountains.
You
had
best
wake
Lucy.
It
is
as
well
that
the
servants
do
not
sleep
in
the
house."
While
Ferrier
was
absent,
preparing
his
daughter
for
the
approaching
journey,
Jefferson
Hope
packed
all
the
eatables
that
he
could
find
into
a
small
parcel,
and
filled
a
stoneware
jar
with
water,
for
he
knew
by
experience
that
the
mountain
wells
were
few
and
far
between.
He
had
hardly
completed
his
arrangements
before
the
farmer
returned
with
his
daughter
all
dressed
and
ready
for
a
start.
The
greeting
between
the
lovers
was
warm,
but
brief,
for
minutes
were
precious,
and
there
was
much
to
be
done.
"We
must
make
our
start
at
once,"
said
Jefferson
Hope,
speaking
in
a
low
but
resolute
voice,
like
one
who
realizes
the
greatness
of
the
peril,
but
has
steeled
his
heart
to
meet
it.
"The
front
and
back
entrances
are
watched,
but
with
caution
we
may
get
away
through
the
side
window
and
across
the
fields.
Once
on
the
road
we
are
only
two
miles
from
the
Ravine
where
the
horses
are
waiting.
By
daybreak
we
should
be
half
way
through
the
mountains."
"What
if
we
are
stopped,"
asked
Ferrier.
Hope
slapped
the
revolver
butt
which
protruded
from
the
front
of
his
tunic.
"If
they
are
too
many
for
us
we
shall
take
two
or
three
of
them
with
us,"
he
said
with
a
sinister
smile.
The
lights
inside
the
house
had
all
been
extinguished,
and
from
the
darkened
window
Ferrier
peered
over
the
fields
which
had
been
his
own,
and
which
he
was
now
about
to
abandon
for
ever.
He
had
long
nerved
himself
to
the
sacrifice,
however,
and
the
thought
of
the
honour
and
happiness
of
his
daughter
outweighed
any
regret
at
his
ruined
fortunes.
All
looked
so
peaceful
and
happy,
the
rustling
trees
and
the
broad
silent
stretch
of
grain
land,
that
it
was
difficult
to
realize
that
the
spirit
of
murder
lurked
through
it
all.
Yet
the
white
face
and
set
expression
of
the
young
hunter
showed
that
in
his
approach
to
the
house
he
had
seen
enough
to
satisfy
him
upon
that
head.
Ferrier
carried
the
bag
of
gold
and
notes,
Jefferson
Hope
had
the
scanty
provisions
and
water,
while
Lucy
had
a
small
bundle
containing
a
few
of
her
more
valued
possessions.
Opening
the
window
very
slowly
and
carefully,
they
waited
until
a
dark
cloud
had
somewhat
obscured
the
night,
and
then
one
by
one
passed
through
into
the
little
garden.
With
bated
breath
and
crouching
figures
they
stumbled
across
it,
and
gained
the
shelter
of
the
hedge,
which
they
skirted
until
they
came
to
the
gap
which
opened
into
the
cornfields.
They
had
just
reached
this
point
when
the
young
man
seized
his
two
companions
and
dragged
them
down
into
the
shadow,
where
they
lay
silent
and
trembling.
It
was
as
well
that
his
prairie
training
had
given
Jefferson
Hope
the
ears
of
a
lynx.
He
and
his
friends
had
hardly
crouched
down
before
the
melancholy
hooting
of
a
mountain
owl
was
heard
within
a
few
yards
of
them,
which
was
immediately
answered
by
another
hoot
at
a
small
distance.
At
the
same
moment
a
vague
shadowy
figure
emerged
from
the
gap
for
which
they
had
been
making,
and
uttered
the
plaintive
signal
cry
again,
on
which
a
second
man
appeared
out
of
the
obscurity.
"To
morrow
at
midnight,"
said
the
first
who
appeared
to
be
in
authority.
"When
the
Whip
poor
Will
calls
three
times."
"It
is
well,"
returned
the
other.
"Shall
I
tell
Brother
Drebber?"
"Pass
it
on
to
him,
and
from
him
to
the
others.
Nine
to
seven!"
"Seven
to
five!"
repeated
the
other,
and
the
two
figures
flitted
away
in
different
directions.
Their
concluding
words
had
evidently
been
some
form
of
sign
and
countersign.
The
instant
that
their
footsteps
had
died
away
in
the
distance,
Jefferson
Hope
sprang
to
his
feet,
and
helping
his
companions
through
the
gap,
led
the
way
across
the
fields
at
the
top
of
his
speed,
supporting
and
half
carrying
the
girl
when
her
strength
appeared
to
fail
her.
"Hurry
on!
hurry
on!"
he
gasped
from
time
to
time.
"We
are
through
the
line
of
sentinels.
Everything
depends
on
speed.
Hurry
on!"
Once
on
the
high
road
they
made
rapid
progress.
Only
once
did
they
meet
anyone,
and
then
they
managed
to
slip
into
a
field,
and
so
avoid
recognition.
Before
reaching
the
town
the
hunter
branched
away
into
a
rugged
and
narrow
footpath
which
led
to
the
mountains.
Two
dark
jagged
peaks
loomed
above
them
through
the
darkness,
and
the
defile
which
led
between
them
was
the
Eagle
Canon
in
which
the
horses
were
awaiting
them.
With
unerring
instinct
Jefferson
Hope
picked
his
way
among
the
great
boulders
and
along
the
bed
of
a
dried
up
watercourse,
until
he
came
to
the
retired
corner,
screened
with
rocks,
where
the
faithful
animals
had
been
picketed.
The
girl
was
placed
upon
the
mule,
and
old
Ferrier
upon
one
of
the
horses,
with
his
money
bag,
while
Jefferson
Hope
led
the
other
along
the
precipitous
and
dangerous
path.
It
was
a
bewildering
route
for
anyone
who
was
not
accustomed
to
face
Nature
in
her
wildest
moods.
On
the
one
side
a
great
crag
towered
up
a
thousand
feet
or
more,
black,
stern,
and
menacing,
with
long
basaltic
columns
upon
its
rugged
surface
like
the
ribs
of
some
petrified
monster.
On
the
other
hand
a
wild
chaos
of
boulders
and
debris
made
all
advance
impossible.
Between
the
two
ran
the
irregular
track,
so
narrow
in
places
that
they
had
to
travel
in
Indian
file,
and
so
rough
that
only
practised
riders
could
have
traversed
it
at
all.
Yet
in
spite
of
all
dangers
and
difficulties,
the
hearts
of
the
fugitives
were
light
within
them,
for
every
step
increased
the
distance
between
them
and
the
terrible
despotism
from
which
they
were
flying.
They
soon
had
a
proof,
however,
that
they
were
still
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Saints.
They
had
reached
the
very
wildest
and
most
desolate
portion
of
the
pass
when
the
girl
gave
a
startled
cry,
and
pointed
upwards.
On
a
rock
which
overlooked
the
track,
showing
out
dark
and
plain
against
the
sky,
there
stood
a
solitary
sentinel.
He
saw
them
as
soon
as
they
perceived
him,
and
his
military
challenge
of
"Who
goes
there?"
rang
through
the
silent
ravine.
"Travellers
for
Nevada,"
said
Jefferson
Hope,
with
his
hand
upon
the
rifle
which
hung
by
his
saddle.
They
could
see
the
lonely
watcher
fingering
his
gun,
and
peering
down
at
them
as
if
dissatisfied
at
their
reply.
"By
whose
permission?"
he
asked.
"The
Holy
Four,"
answered
Ferrier.
His
Mormon
experiences
had
taught
him
that
that
was
the
highest
authority
to
which
he
could
refer.
"Nine
from
seven,"
cried
the
sentinel.
"Seven
from
five,"
returned
Jefferson
Hope
promptly,
remembering
the
countersign
which
he
had
heard
in
the
garden.
"Pass,
and
the
Lord
go
with
you,"
said
the
voice
from
above.
Beyond
his
post
the
path
broadened
out,
and
the
horses
were
able
to
break
into
a
trot.
Looking
back,
they
could
see
the
solitary
watcher
leaning
upon
his
gun,
and
knew
that
they
had
passed
the
outlying
post
of
the
chosen
people,
and
that
freedom
lay
before
them.
ALL
night
their
course
lay
through
intricate
defiles
and
over
irregular
and
rock
strewn
paths.
More
than
once
they
lost
their
way,
but
Hope's
intimate
knowledge
of
the
mountains
enabled
them
to
regain
the
track
once
more.
When
morning
broke,
a
scene
of
marvellous
though
savage
beauty
lay
before
them.
In
every
direction
the
great
snow
capped
peaks
hemmed
them
in,
peeping
over
each
other's
shoulders
to
the
far
horizon.
So
steep
were
the
rocky
banks
on
either
side
of
them,
that
the
larch
and
the
pine
seemed
to
be
suspended
over
their
heads,
and
to
need
only
a
gust
of
wind
to
come
hurtling
down
upon
them.
Nor
was
the
fear
entirely
an
illusion,
for
the
barren
valley
was
thickly
strewn
with
trees
and
boulders
which
had
fallen
in
a
similar
manner.
Even
as
they
passed,
a
great
rock
came
thundering
down
with
a
hoarse
rattle
which
woke
the
echoes
in
the
silent
gorges,
and
startled
the
weary
horses
into
a
gallop.
As
the
sun
rose
slowly
above
the
eastern
horizon,
the
caps
of
the
great
mountains
lit
up
one
after
the
other,
like
lamps
at
a
festival,
until
they
were
all
ruddy
and
glowing.
The
magnificent
spectacle
cheered
the
hearts
of
the
three
fugitives
and
gave
them
fresh
energy.
At
a
wild
torrent
which
swept
out
of
a
ravine
they
called
a
halt
and
watered
their
horses,
while
they
partook
of
a
hasty
breakfast.
Lucy
and
her
father
would
fain
have
rested
longer,
but
Jefferson
Hope
was
inexorable.
"They
will
be
upon
our
track
by
this
time,"
he
said.
"Everything
depends
upon
our
speed.
Once
safe
in
Carson
we
may
rest
for
the
remainder
of
our
lives."
During
the
whole
of
that
day
they
struggled
on
through
the
defiles,
and
by
evening
they
calculated
that
they
were
more
than
thirty
miles
from
their
enemies.
At
night
time
they
chose
the
base
of
a
beetling
crag,
where
the
rocks
offered
some
protection
from
the
chill
wind,
and
there
huddled
together
for
warmth,
they
enjoyed
a
few
hours'
sleep.
Before
daybreak,
however,
they
were
up
and
on
their
way
once
more.
They
had
seen
no
signs
of
any
pursuers,
and
Jefferson
Hope
began
to
think
that
they
were
fairly
out
of
the
reach
of
the
terrible
organization
whose
enmity
they
had
incurred.
He
little
knew
how
far
that
iron
grasp
could
reach,
or
how
soon
it
was
to
close
upon
them
and
crush
them.
About
the
middle
of
the
second
day
of
their
flight
their
scanty
store
of
provisions
began
to
run
out.
This
gave
the
hunter
little
uneasiness,
however,
for
there
was
game
to
be
had
among
the
mountains,
and
he
had
frequently
before
had
to
depend
upon
his
rifle
for
the
needs
of
life.
Choosing
a
sheltered
nook,
he
piled
together
a
few
dried
branches
and
made
a
blazing
fire,
at
which
his
companions
might
warm
themselves,
for
they
were
now
nearly
five
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
level,
and
the
air
was
bitter
and
keen.
Having
tethered
the
horses,
and
bade
Lucy
adieu,
he
threw
his
gun
over
his
shoulder,
and
set
out
in
search
of
whatever
chance
might
throw
in
his
way.
Looking
back
he
saw
the
old
man
and
the
young
girl
crouching
over
the
blazing
fire,
while
the
three
animals
stood
motionless
in
the
back
ground.
Then
the
intervening
rocks
hid
them
from
his
view.
He
walked
for
a
couple
of
miles
through
one
ravine
after
another
without
success,
though
from
the
marks
upon
the
bark
of
the
trees,
and
other
indications,
he
judged
that
there
were
numerous
bears
in
the
vicinity.
At
last,
after
two
or
three
hours'
fruitless
search,
he
was
thinking
of
turning
back
in
despair,
when
casting
his
eyes
upwards
he
saw
a
sight
which
sent
a
thrill
of
pleasure
through
his
heart.
On
the
edge
of
a
jutting
pinnacle,
three
or
four
hundred
feet
above
him,
there
stood
a
creature
somewhat
resembling
a
sheep
in
appearance,
but
armed
with
a
pair
of
gigantic
horns.
The
big
horn
for
so
it
is
called
was
acting,
probably,
as
a
guardian
over
a
flock
which
were
invisible
to
the
hunter;
but
fortunately
it
was
heading
in
the
opposite
direction,
and
had
not
perceived
him.
Lying
on
his
face,
he
rested
his
rifle
upon
a
rock,
and
took
a
long
and
steady
aim
before
drawing
the
trigger.
The
animal
sprang
into
the
air,
tottered
for
a
moment
upon
the
edge
of
the
precipice,
and
then
came
crashing
down
into
the
valley
beneath.
The
creature
was
too
unwieldy
to
lift,
so
the
hunter
contented
himself
with
cutting
away
one
haunch
and
part
of
the
flank.
With
this
trophy
over
his
shoulder,
he
hastened
to
retrace
his
steps,
for
the
evening
was
already
drawing
in.
He
had
hardly
started,
however,
before
he
realized
the
difficulty
which
faced
him.
In
his
eagerness
he
had
wandered
far
past
the
ravines
which
were
known
to
him,
and
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
pick
out
the
path
which
he
had
taken.
The
valley
in
which
he
found
himself
divided
and
sub
divided
into
many
gorges,
which
were
so
like
each
other
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other.
He
followed
one
for
a
mile
or
more
until
he
came
to
a
mountain
torrent
which
he
was
sure
that
he
had
never
seen
before.
Convinced
that
he
had
taken
the
wrong
turn,
he
tried
another,
but
with
the
same
result.
Night
was
coming
on
rapidly,
and
it
was
almost
dark
before
he
at
last
found
himself
in
a
defile
which
was
familiar
to
him.
Even
then
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
keep
to
the
right
track,
for
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen,
and
the
high
cliffs
on
either
side
made
the
obscurity
more
profound.
Weighed
down
with
his
burden,
and
weary
from
his
exertions,
he
stumbled
along,
keeping
up
his
heart
by
the
reflection
that
every
step
brought
him
nearer
to
Lucy,
and
that
he
carried
with
him
enough
to
ensure
them
food
for
the
remainder
of
their
journey.
He
had
now
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
very
defile
in
which
he
had
left
them.
Even
in
the
darkness
he
could
recognize
the
outline
of
the
cliffs
which
bounded
it.
They
must,
he
reflected,
be
awaiting
him
anxiously,
for
he
had
been
absent
nearly
five
hours.
In
the
gladness
of
his
heart
he
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
made
the
glen
re
echo
to
a
loud
halloo
as
a
signal
that
he
was
coming.
He
paused
and
listened
for
an
answer.
None
came
save
his
own
cry,
which
clattered
up
the
dreary
silent
ravines,
and
was
borne
back
to
his
ears
in
countless
repetitions.
Again
he
shouted,
even
louder
than
before,
and
again
no
whisper
came
back
from
the
friends
whom
he
had
left
such
a
short
time
ago.
A
vague,
nameless
dread
came
over
him,
and
he
hurried
onwards
frantically,
dropping
the
precious
food
in
his
agitation.
When
he
turned
the
corner,
he
came
full
in
sight
of
the
spot
where
the
fire
had
been
lit.
There
was
still
a
glowing
pile
of
wood
ashes
there,
but
it
had
evidently
not
been
tended
since
his
departure.
The
same
dead
silence
still
reigned
all
round.
With
his
fears
all
changed
to
convictions,
he
hurried
on.
There
was
no
living
creature
near
the
remains
of
the
fire:
animals,
man,
maiden,
all
were
gone.
It
was
only
too
clear
that
some
sudden
and
terrible
disaster
had
occurred
during
his
absence
a
disaster
which
had
embraced
them
all,
and
yet
had
left
no
traces
behind
it.
Bewildered
and
stunned
by
this
blow,
Jefferson
Hope
felt
his
head
spin
round,
and
had
to
lean
upon
his
rifle
to
save
himself
from
falling.
He
was
essentially
a
man
of
action,
however,
and
speedily
recovered
from
his
temporary
impotence.
Seizing
a
half
consumed
piece
of
wood
from
the
smouldering
fire,
he
blew
it
into
a
flame,
and
proceeded
with
its
help
to
examine
the
little
camp.
The
ground
was
all
stamped
down
by
the
feet
of
horses,
showing
that
a
large
party
of
mounted
men
had
overtaken
the
fugitives,
and
the
direction
of
their
tracks
proved
that
they
had
afterwards
turned
back
to
Salt
Lake
City.
Had
they
carried
back
both
of
his
companions
with
them?
Jefferson
Hope
had
almost
persuaded
himself
that
they
must
have
done
so,
when
his
eye
fell
upon
an
object
which
made
every
nerve
of
his
body
tingle
within
him.
A
little
way
on
one
side
of
the
camp
was
a
low
lying
heap
of
reddish
soil,
which
had
assuredly
not
been
there
before.
There
was
no
mistaking
it
for
anything
but
a
newly
dug
grave.
As
the
young
hunter
approached
it,
he
perceived
that
a
stick
had
been
planted
on
it,
with
a
sheet
of
paper
stuck
in
the
cleft
fork
of
it.
The
inscription
upon
the
paper
was
brief,
but
to
the
point:
JOHN
FERRIER,
FORMERLY
OF
SALT
LAKE
CITY,
[22]
Died
August
4th,
1860.
The
sturdy
old
man,
whom
he
had
left
so
short
a
time
before,
was
gone,
then,
and
this
was
all
his
epitaph.
Jefferson
Hope
looked
wildly
round
to
see
if
there
was
a
second
grave,
but
there
was
no
sign
of
one.
Lucy
had
been
carried
back
by
their
terrible
pursuers
to
fulfil
her
original
destiny,
by
becoming
one
of
the
harem
of
the
Elder's
son.
As
the
young
fellow
realized
the
certainty
of
her
fate,
and
his
own
powerlessness
to
prevent
it,
he
wished
that
he,
too,
was
lying
with
the
old
farmer
in
his
last
silent
resting
place.
Again,
however,
his
active
spirit
shook
off
the
lethargy
which
springs
from
despair.
If
there
was
nothing
else
left
to
him,
he
could
at
least
devote
his
life
to
revenge.
With
indomitable
patience
and
perseverance,
Jefferson
Hope
possessed
also
a
power
of
sustained
vindictiveness,
which
he
may
have
learned
from
the
Indians
amongst
whom
he
had
lived.
As
he
stood
by
the
desolate
fire,
he
felt
that
the
only
one
thing
which
could
assuage
his
grief
would
be
thorough
and
complete
retribution,
brought
by
his
own
hand
upon
his
enemies.
His
strong
will
and
untiring
energy
should,
he
determined,
be
devoted
to
that
one
end.
With
a
grim,
white
face,
he
retraced
his
steps
to
where
he
had
dropped
the
food,
and
having
stirred
up
the
smouldering
fire,
he
cooked
enough
to
last
him
for
a
few
days.
This
he
made
up
into
a
bundle,
and,
tired
as
he
was,
he
set
himself
to
walk
back
through
the
mountains
upon
the
track
of
the
avenging
angels.
For
five
days
he
toiled
footsore
and
weary
through
the
defiles
which
he
had
already
traversed
on
horseback.
At
night
he
flung
himself
down
among
the
rocks,
and
snatched
a
few
hours
of
sleep;
but
before
daybreak
he
was
always
well
on
his
way.
On
the
sixth
day,
he
reached
the
Eagle
Canon,
from
which
they
had
commenced
their
ill
fated
flight.
Thence
he
could
look
down
upon
the
home
of
the
saints.
Worn
and
exhausted,
he
leaned
upon
his
rifle
and
shook
his
gaunt
hand
fiercely
at
the
silent
widespread
city
beneath
him.
As
he
looked
at
it,
he
observed
that
there
were
flags
in
some
of
the
principal
streets,
and
other
signs
of
festivity.
He
was
still
speculating
as
to
what
this
might
mean
when
he
heard
the
clatter
of
horse's
hoofs,
and
saw
a
mounted
man
riding
towards
him.
As
he
approached,
he
recognized
him
as
a
Mormon
named
Cowper,
to
whom
he
had
rendered
services
at
different
times.
He
therefore
accosted
him
when
he
got
up
to
him,
with
the
object
of
finding
out
what
Lucy
Ferrier's
fate
had
been.
"I
am
Jefferson
Hope,"
he
said.
"You
remember
me."
The
Mormon
looked
at
him
with
undisguised
astonishment
indeed,
it
was
difficult
to
recognize
in
this
tattered,
unkempt
wanderer,
with
ghastly
white
face
and
fierce,
wild
eyes,
the
spruce
young
hunter
of
former
days.
Having,
however,
at
last,
satisfied
himself
as
to
his
identity,
the
man's
surprise
changed
to
consternation.
"You
are
mad
to
come
here,"
he
cried.
"It
is
as
much
as
my
own
life
is
worth
to
be
seen
talking
with
you.
There
is
a
warrant
against
you
from
the
Holy
Four
for
assisting
the
Ferriers
away."
"I
don't
fear
them,
or
their
warrant,"
Hope
said,
earnestly.
"You
must
know
something
of
this
matter,
Cowper.
I
conjure
you
by
everything
you
hold
dear
to
answer
a
few
questions.
We
have
always
been
friends.
For
God's
sake,
don't
refuse
to
answer
me."
"What
is
it?"
the
Mormon
asked
uneasily.
"Be
quick.
The
very
rocks
have
ears
and
the
trees
eyes."
"What
has
become
of
Lucy
Ferrier?"
"She
was
married
yesterday
to
young
Drebber.
Hold
up,
man,
hold
up,
you
have
no
life
left
in
you."
"Don't
mind
me,"
said
Hope
faintly.
He
was
white
to
the
very
lips,
and
had
sunk
down
on
the
stone
against
which
he
had
been
leaning.
"Married,
you
say?"
"Married
yesterday
that's
what
those
flags
are
for
on
the
Endowment
House.
There
was
some
words
between
young
Drebber
and
young
Stangerson
as
to
which
was
to
have
her.
They'd
both
been
in
the
party
that
followed
them,
and
Stangerson
had
shot
her
father,
which
seemed
to
give
him
the
best
claim;
but
when
they
argued
it
out
in
council,
Drebber's
party
was
the
stronger,
so
the
Prophet
gave
her
over
to
him.
No
one
won't
have
her
very
long
though,
for
I
saw
death
in
her
face
yesterday.
She
is
more
like
a
ghost
than
a
woman.
Are
you
off,
then?"
"Yes,
I
am
off,"
said
Jefferson
Hope,
who
had
risen
from
his
seat.
His
face
might
have
been
chiselled
out
of
marble,
so
hard
and
set
was
its
expression,
while
its
eyes
glowed
with
a
baleful
light.
"Where
are
you
going?"
"Never
mind,"
he
answered;
and,
slinging
his
weapon
over
his
shoulder,
strode
off
down
the
gorge
and
so
away
into
the
heart
of
the
mountains
to
the
haunts
of
the
wild
beasts.
Amongst
them
all
there
was
none
so
fierce
and
so
dangerous
as
himself.
The
prediction
of
the
Mormon
was
only
too
well
fulfilled.
Whether
it
was
the
terrible
death
of
her
father
or
the
effects
of
the
hateful
marriage
into
which
she
had
been
forced,
poor
Lucy
never
held
up
her
head
again,
but
pined
away
and
died
within
a
month.
Her
sottish
husband,
who
had
married
her
principally
for
the
sake
of
John
Ferrier's
property,
did
not
affect
any
great
grief
at
his
bereavement;
but
his
other
wives
mourned
over
her,
and
sat
up
with
her
the
night
before
the
burial,
as
is
the
Mormon
custom.
They
were
grouped
round
the
bier
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning,
when,
to
their
inexpressible
fear
and
astonishment,
the
door
was
flung
open,
and
a
savage
looking,
weather
beaten
man
in
tattered
garments
strode
into
the
room.
Without
a
glance
or
a
word
to
the
cowering
women,
he
walked
up
to
the
white
silent
figure
which
had
once
contained
the
pure
soul
of
Lucy
Ferrier.
Stooping
over
her,
he
pressed
his
lips
reverently
to
her
cold
forehead,
and
then,
snatching
up
her
hand,
he
took
the
wedding
ring
from
her
finger.
"She
shall
not
be
buried
in
that,"
he
cried
with
a
fierce
snarl,
and
before
an
alarm
could
be
raised
sprang
down
the
stairs
and
was
gone.
So
strange
and
so
brief
was
the
episode,
that
the
watchers
might
have
found
it
hard
to
believe
it
themselves
or
persuade
other
people
of
it,
had
it
not
been
for
the
undeniable
fact
that
the
circlet
of
gold
which
marked
her
as
having
been
a
bride
had
disappeared.
For
some
months
Jefferson
Hope
lingered
among
the
mountains,
leading
a
strange
wild
life,
and
nursing
in
his
heart
the
fierce
desire
for
vengeance
which
possessed
him.
Tales
were
told
in
the
City
of
the
weird
figure
which
was
seen
prowling
about
the
suburbs,
and
which
haunted
the
lonely
mountain
gorges.
Once
a
bullet
whistled
through
Stangerson's
window
and
flattened
itself
upon
the
wall
within
a
foot
of
him.
On
another
occasion,
as
Drebber
passed
under
a
cliff
a
great
boulder
crashed
down
on
him,
and
he
only
escaped
a
terrible
death
by
throwing
himself
upon
his
face.
The
two
young
Mormons
were
not
long
in
discovering
the
reason
of
these
attempts
upon
their
lives,
and
led
repeated
expeditions
into
the
mountains
in
the
hope
of
capturing
or
killing
their
enemy,
but
always
without
success.
Then
they
adopted
the
precaution
of
never
going
out
alone
or
after
nightfall,
and
of
having
their
houses
guarded.
After
a
time
they
were
able
to
relax
these
measures,
for
nothing
was
either
heard
or
seen
of
their
opponent,
and
they
hoped
that
time
had
cooled
his
vindictiveness.
Far
from
doing
so,
it
had,
if
anything,
augmented
it.
The
hunter's
mind
was
of
a
hard,
unyielding
nature,
and
the
predominant
idea
of
revenge
had
taken
such
complete
possession
of
it
that
there
was
no
room
for
any
other
emotion.
He
was,
however,
above
all
things
practical.
He
soon
realized
that
even
his
iron
constitution
could
not
stand
the
incessant
strain
which
he
was
putting
upon
it.
Exposure
and
want
of
wholesome
food
were
wearing
him
out.
If
he
died
like
a
dog
among
the
mountains,
what
was
to
become
of
his
revenge
then?
And
yet
such
a
death
was
sure
to
overtake
him
if
he
persisted.
He
felt
that
that
was
to
play
his
enemy's
game,
so
he
reluctantly
returned
to
the
old
Nevada
mines,
there
to
recruit
his
health
and
to
amass
money
enough
to
allow
him
to
pursue
his
object
without
privation.
His
intention
had
been
to
be
absent
a
year
at
the
most,
but
a
combination
of
unforeseen
circumstances
prevented
his
leaving
the
mines
for
nearly
five.
At
the
end
of
that
time,
however,
his
memory
of
his
wrongs
and
his
craving
for
revenge
were
quite
as
keen
as
on
that
memorable
night
when
he
had
stood
by
John
Ferrier's
grave.
Disguised,
and
under
an
assumed
name,
he
returned
to
Salt
Lake
City,
careless
what
became
of
his
own
life,
as
long
as
he
obtained
what
he
knew
to
be
justice.
There
he
found
evil
tidings
awaiting
him.
There
had
been
a
schism
among
the
Chosen
People
a
few
months
before,
some
of
the
younger
members
of
the
Church
having
rebelled
against
the
authority
of
the
Elders,
and
the
result
had
been
the
secession
of
a
certain
number
of
the
malcontents,
who
had
left
Utah
and
become
Gentiles.
Among
these
had
been
Drebber
and
Stangerson;
and
no
one
knew
whither
they
had
gone.
Rumour
reported
that
Drebber
had
managed
to
convert
a
large
part
of
his
property
into
money,
and
that
he
had
departed
a
wealthy
man,
while
his
companion,
Stangerson,
was
comparatively
poor.
There
was
no
clue
at
all,
however,
as
to
their
whereabouts.
Many
a
man,
however
vindictive,
would
have
abandoned
all
thought
of
revenge
in
the
face
of
such
a
difficulty,
but
Jefferson
Hope
never
faltered
for
a
moment.
With
the
small
competence
he
possessed,
eked
out
by
such
employment
as
he
could
pick
up,
he
travelled
from
town
to
town
through
the
United
States
in
quest
of
his
enemies.
Year
passed
into
year,
his
black
hair
turned
grizzled,
but
still
he
wandered
on,
a
human
bloodhound,
with
his
mind
wholly
set
upon
the
one
object
upon
which
he
had
devoted
his
life.
At
last
his
perseverance
was
rewarded.
It
was
but
a
glance
of
a
face
in
a
window,
but
that
one
glance
told
him
that
Cleveland
in
Ohio
possessed
the
men
whom
he
was
in
pursuit
of.
He
returned
to
his
miserable
lodgings
with
his
plan
of
vengeance
all
arranged.
It
chanced,
however,
that
Drebber,
looking
from
his
window,
had
recognized
the
vagrant
in
the
street,
and
had
read
murder
in
his
eyes.
He
hurried
before
a
justice
of
the
peace,
accompanied
by
Stangerson,
who
had
become
his
private
secretary,
and
represented
to
him
that
they
were
in
danger
of
their
lives
from
the
jealousy
and
hatred
of
an
old
rival.
That
evening
Jefferson
Hope
was
taken
into
custody,
and
not
being
able
to
find
sureties,
was
detained
for
some
weeks.
When
at
last
he
was
liberated,
it
was
only
to
find
that
Drebber's
house
was
deserted,
and
that
he
and
his
secretary
had
departed
for
Europe.
Again
the
avenger
had
been
foiled,
and
again
his
concentrated
hatred
urged
him
to
continue
the
pursuit.
Funds
were
wanting,
however,
and
for
some
time
he
had
to
return
to
work,
saving
every
dollar
for
his
approaching
journey.
At
last,
having
collected
enough
to
keep
life
in
him,
he
departed
for
Europe,
and
tracked
his
enemies
from
city
to
city,
working
his
way
in
any
menial
capacity,
but
never
overtaking
the
fugitives.
When
he
reached
St.
Petersburg
they
had
departed
for
Paris;
and
when
he
followed
them
there
he
learned
that
they
had
just
set
off
for
Copenhagen.
At
the
Danish
capital
he
was
again
a
few
days
late,
for
they
had
journeyed
on
to
London,
where
he
at
last
succeeded
in
running
them
to
earth.
As
to
what
occurred
there,
we
cannot
do
better
than
quote
the
old
hunter's
own
account,
as
duly
recorded
in
Dr.
Watson's
Journal,
to
which
we
are
already
under
such
obligations.
OUR
prisoner's
furious
resistance
did
not
apparently
indicate
any
ferocity
in
his
disposition
towards
ourselves,
for
on
finding
himself
powerless,
he
smiled
in
an
affable
manner,
and
expressed
his
hopes
that
he
had
not
hurt
any
of
us
in
the
scuffle.
"I
guess
you're
going
to
take
me
to
the
police
station,"
he
remarked
to
Sherlock
Holmes.
"My
cab's
at
the
door.
If
you'll
loose
my
legs
I'll
walk
down
to
it.
I'm
not
so
light
to
lift
as
I
used
to
be."
Gregson
and
Lestrade
exchanged
glances
as
if
they
thought
this
proposition
rather
a
bold
one;
but
Holmes
at
once
took
the
prisoner
at
his
word,
and
loosened
the
towel
which
we
had
bound
round
his
ancles.
He
rose
and
stretched
his
legs,
as
though
to
assure
himself
that
they
were
free
once
more.
I
remember
that
I
thought
to
myself,
as
I
eyed
him,
that
I
had
seldom
seen
a
more
powerfully
built
man;
and
his
dark
sunburned
face
bore
an
expression
of
determination
and
energy
which
was
as
formidable
as
his
personal
strength.
"If
there's
a
vacant
place
for
a
chief
of
the
police,
I
reckon
you
are
the
man
for
it,"
he
said,
gazing
with
undisguised
admiration
at
my
fellow
lodger.
"The
way
you
kept
on
my
trail
was
a
caution."
"You
had
better
come
with
me,"
said
Holmes
to
the
two
detectives.
"I
can
drive
you,"
said
Lestrade.
"Good!
and
Gregson
can
come
inside
with
me.
You
too,
Doctor,
you
have
taken
an
interest
in
the
case
and
may
as
well
stick
to
us."
I
assented
gladly,
and
we
all
descended
together.
Our
prisoner
made
no
attempt
at
escape,
but
stepped
calmly
into
the
cab
which
had
been
his,
and
we
followed
him.
Lestrade
mounted
the
box,
whipped
up
the
horse,
and
brought
us
in
a
very
short
time
to
our
destination.
We
were
ushered
into
a
small
chamber
where
a
police
Inspector
noted
down
our
prisoner's
name
and
the
names
of
the
men
with
whose
murder
he
had
been
charged.
The
official
was
a
white
faced
unemotional
man,
who
went
through
his
duties
in
a
dull
mechanical
way.
"The
prisoner
will
be
put
before
the
magistrates
in
the
course
of
the
week,"
he
said;
"in
the
mean
time,
Mr.
Jefferson
Hope,
have
you
anything
that
you
wish
to
say?
I
must
warn
you
that
your
words
will
be
taken
down,
and
may
be
used
against
you."
"I've
got
a
good
deal
to
say,"
our
prisoner
said
slowly.
"I
want
to
tell
you
gentlemen
all
about
it."
"Hadn't
you
better
reserve
that
for
your
trial?"
asked
the
Inspector.
"I
may
never
be
tried,"
he
answered.
"You
needn't
look
startled.
It
isn't
suicide
I
am
thinking
of.
Are
you
a
Doctor?"
He
turned
his
fierce
dark
eyes
upon
me
as
he
asked
this
last
question.
"Yes;
I
am,"
I
answered.
"Then
put
your
hand
here,"
he
said,
with
a
smile,
motioning
with
his
manacled
wrists
towards
his
chest.
I
did
so;
and
became
at
once
conscious
of
an
extraordinary
throbbing
and
commotion
which
was
going
on
inside.
The
walls
of
his
chest
seemed
to
thrill
and
quiver
as
a
frail
building
would
do
inside
when
some
powerful
engine
was
at
work.
In
the
silence
of
the
room
I
could
hear
a
dull
humming
and
buzzing
noise
which
proceeded
from
the
same
source.
"Why,"
I
cried,
"you
have
an
aortic
aneurism!"
"That's
what
they
call
it,"
he
said,
placidly.
"I
went
to
a
Doctor
last
week
about
it,
and
he
told
me
that
it
is
bound
to
burst
before
many
days
passed.
It
has
been
getting
worse
for
years.
I
got
it
from
over
exposure
and
under
feeding
among
the
Salt
Lake
Mountains.
I've
done
my
work
now,
and
I
don't
care
how
soon
I
go,
but
I
should
like
to
leave
some
account
of
the
business
behind
me.
I
don't
want
to
be
remembered
as
a
common
cut
throat."
The
Inspector
and
the
two
detectives
had
a
hurried
discussion
as
to
the
advisability
of
allowing
him
to
tell
his
story.
"Do
you
consider,
Doctor,
that
there
is
immediate
danger?"
the
former
asked,
[24]
"Most
certainly
there
is,"
I
answered.
"In
that
case
it
is
clearly
our
duty,
in
the
interests
of
justice,
to
take
his
statement,"
said
the
Inspector.
"You
are
at
liberty,
sir,
to
give
your
account,
which
I
again
warn
you
will
be
taken
down."
"I'll
sit
down,
with
your
leave,"
the
prisoner
said,
suiting
the
action
to
the
word.
"This
aneurism
of
mine
makes
me
easily
tired,
and
the
tussle
we
had
half
an
hour
ago
has
not
mended
matters.
I'm
on
the
brink
of
the
grave,
and
I
am
not
likely
to
lie
to
you.
Every
word
I
say
is
the
absolute
truth,
and
how
you
use
it
is
a
matter
of
no
consequence
to
me."
With
these
words,
Jefferson
Hope
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
began
the
following
remarkable
statement.
He
spoke
in
a
calm
and
methodical
manner,
as
though
the
events
which
he
narrated
were
commonplace
enough.
I
can
vouch
for
the
accuracy
of
the
subjoined
account,
for
I
have
had
access
to
Lestrade's
note
book,
in
which
the
prisoner's
words
were
taken
down
exactly
as
they
were
uttered.
"It
don't
much
matter
to
you
why
I
hated
these
men,"
he
said;
"it's
enough
that
they
were
guilty
of
the
death
of
two
human
beings
a
father
and
a
daughter
and
that
they
had,
therefore,
forfeited
their
own
lives.
After
the
lapse
of
time
that
has
passed
since
their
crime,
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
secure
a
conviction
against
them
in
any
court.
I
knew
of
their
guilt
though,
and
I
determined
that
I
should
be
judge,
jury,
and
executioner
all
rolled
into
one.
You'd
have
done
the
same,
if
you
have
any
manhood
in
you,
if
you
had
been
in
my
place.
"That
girl
that
I
spoke
of
was
to
have
married
me
twenty
years
ago.
She
was
forced
into
marrying
that
same
Drebber,
and
broke
her
heart
over
it.
I
took
the
marriage
ring
from
her
dead
finger,
and
I
vowed
that
his
dying
eyes
should
rest
upon
that
very
ring,
and
that
his
last
thoughts
should
be
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
punished.
I
have
carried
it
about
with
me,
and
have
followed
him
and
his
accomplice
over
two
continents
until
I
caught
them.
They
thought
to
tire
me
out,
but
they
could
not
do
it.
If
I
die
to
morrow,
as
is
likely
enough,
I
die
knowing
that
my
work
in
this
world
is
done,
and
well
done.
They
have
perished,
and
by
my
hand.
There
is
nothing
left
for
me
to
hope
for,
or
to
desire.
"They
were
rich
and
I
was
poor,
so
that
it
was
no
easy
matter
for
me
to
follow
them.
When
I
got
to
London
my
pocket
was
about
empty,
and
I
found
that
I
must
turn
my
hand
to
something
for
my
living.
Driving
and
riding
are
as
natural
to
me
as
walking,
so
I
applied
at
a
cabowner's
office,
and
soon
got
employment.
I
was
to
bring
a
certain
sum
a
week
to
the
owner,
and
whatever
was
over
that
I
might
keep
for
myself.
There
was
seldom
much
over,
but
I
managed
to
scrape
along
somehow.
The
hardest
job
was
to
learn
my
way
about,
for
I
reckon
that
of
all
the
mazes
that
ever
were
contrived,
this
city
is
the
most
confusing.
I
had
a
map
beside
me
though,
and
when
once
I
had
spotted
the
principal
hotels
and
stations,
I
got
on
pretty
well.
"It
was
some
time
before
I
found
out
where
my
two
gentlemen
were
living;
but
I
inquired
and
inquired
until
at
last
I
dropped
across
them.
They
were
at
a
boarding
house
at
Camberwell,
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
river.
When
once
I
found
them
out
I
knew
that
I
had
them
at
my
mercy.
I
had
grown
my
beard,
and
there
was
no
chance
of
their
recognizing
me.
I
would
dog
them
and
follow
them
until
I
saw
my
opportunity.
I
was
determined
that
they
should
not
escape
me
again.
"They
were
very
near
doing
it
for
all
that.
Go
where
they
would
about
London,
I
was
always
at
their
heels.
Sometimes
I
followed
them
on
my
cab,
and
sometimes
on
foot,
but
the
former
was
the
best,
for
then
they
could
not
get
away
from
me.
It
was
only
early
in
the
morning
or
late
at
night
that
I
could
earn
anything,
so
that
I
began
to
get
behind
hand
with
my
employer.
I
did
not
mind
that,
however,
as
long
as
I
could
lay
my
hand
upon
the
men
I
wanted.
"They
were
very
cunning,
though.
They
must
have
thought
that
there
was
some
chance
of
their
being
followed,
for
they
would
never
go
out
alone,
and
never
after
nightfall.
During
two
weeks
I
drove
behind
them
every
day,
and
never
once
saw
them
separate.
Drebber
himself
was
drunk
half
the
time,
but
Stangerson
was
not
to
be
caught
napping.
I
watched
them
late
and
early,
but
never
saw
the
ghost
of
a
chance;
but
I
was
not
discouraged,
for
something
told
me
that
the
hour
had
almost
come.
My
only
fear
was
that
this
thing
in
my
chest
might
burst
a
little
too
soon
and
leave
my
work
undone.
"At
last,
one
evening
I
was
driving
up
and
down
Torquay
Terrace,
as
the
street
was
called
in
which
they
boarded,
when
I
saw
a
cab
drive
up
to
their
door.
Presently
some
luggage
was
brought
out,
and
after
a
time
Drebber
and
Stangerson
followed
it,
and
drove
off.
I
whipped
up
my
horse
and
kept
within
sight
of
them,
feeling
very
ill
at
ease,
for
I
feared
that
they
were
going
to
shift
their
quarters.
At
Euston
Station
they
got
out,
and
I
left
a
boy
to
hold
my
horse,
and
followed
them
on
to
the
platform.
I
heard
them
ask
for
the
Liverpool
train,
and
the
guard
answer
that
one
had
just
gone
and
there
would
not
be
another
for
some
hours.
Stangerson
seemed
to
be
put
out
at
that,
but
Drebber
was
rather
pleased
than
otherwise.
I
got
so
close
to
them
in
the
bustle
that
I
could
hear
every
word
that
passed
between
them.
Drebber
said
that
he
had
a
little
business
of
his
own
to
do,
and
that
if
the
other
would
wait
for
him
he
would
soon
rejoin
him.
His
companion
remonstrated
with
him,
and
reminded
him
that
they
had
resolved
to
stick
together.
Drebber
answered
that
the
matter
was
a
delicate
one,
and
that
he
must
go
alone.
I
could
not
catch
what
Stangerson
said
to
that,
but
the
other
burst
out
swearing,
and
reminded
him
that
he
was
nothing
more
than
his
paid
servant,
and
that
he
must
not
presume
to
dictate
to
him.
On
that
the
Secretary
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job,
and
simply
bargained
with
him
that
if
he
missed
the
last
train
he
should
rejoin
him
at
Halliday's
Private
Hotel;
to
which
Drebber
answered
that
he
would
be
back
on
the
platform
before
eleven,
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
station.
"The
moment
for
which
I
had
waited
so
long
had
at
last
come.
I
had
my
enemies
within
my
power.
Together
they
could
protect
each
other,
but
singly
they
were
at
my
mercy.
I
did
not
act,
however,
with
undue
precipitation.
My
plans
were
already
formed.
There
is
no
satisfaction
in
vengeance
unless
the
offender
has
time
to
realize
who
it
is
that
strikes
him,
and
why
retribution
has
come
upon
him.
I
had
my
plans
arranged
by
which
I
should
have
the
opportunity
of
making
the
man
who
had
wronged
me
understand
that
his
old
sin
had
found
him
out.
It
chanced
that
some
days
before
a
gentleman
who
had
been
engaged
in
looking
over
some
houses
in
the
Brixton
Road
had
dropped
the
key
of
one
of
them
in
my
carriage.
It
was
claimed
that
same
evening,
and
returned;
but
in
the
interval
I
had
taken
a
moulding
of
it,
and
had
a
duplicate
constructed.
By
means
of
this
I
had
access
to
at
least
one
spot
in
this
great
city
where
I
could
rely
upon
being
free
from
interruption.
How
to
get
Drebber
to
that
house
was
the
difficult
problem
which
I
had
now
to
solve.
"He
walked
down
the
road
and
went
into
one
or
two
liquor
shops,
staying
for
nearly
half
an
hour
in
the
last
of
them.
When
he
came
out
he
staggered
in
his
walk,
and
was
evidently
pretty
well
on.
There
was
a
hansom
just
in
front
of
me,
and
he
hailed
it.
I
followed
it
so
close
that
the
nose
of
my
horse
was
within
a
yard
of
his
driver
the
whole
way.
We
rattled
across
Waterloo
Bridge
and
through
miles
of
streets,
until,
to
my
astonishment,
we
found
ourselves
back
in
the
Terrace
in
which
he
had
boarded.
I
could
not
imagine
what
his
intention
was
in
returning
there;
but
I
went
on
and
pulled
up
my
cab
a
hundred
yards
or
so
from
the
house.
He
entered
it,
and
his
hansom
drove
away.
Give
me
a
glass
of
water,
if
you
please.
My
mouth
gets
dry
with
the
talking."
I
handed
him
the
glass,
and
he
drank
it
down.
"That's
better,"
he
said.
"Well,
I
waited
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour,
or
more,
when
suddenly
there
came
a
noise
like
people
struggling
inside
the
house.
Next
moment
the
door
was
flung
open
and
two
men
appeared,
one
of
whom
was
Drebber,
and
the
other
was
a
young
chap
whom
I
had
never
seen
before.
This
fellow
had
Drebber
by
the
collar,
and
when
they
came
to
the
head
of
the
steps
he
gave
him
a
shove
and
a
kick
which
sent
him
half
across
the
road.
'You
hound,'
he
cried,
shaking
his
stick
at
him;
'I'll
teach
you
to
insult
an
honest
girl!'
He
was
so
hot
that
I
think
he
would
have
thrashed
Drebber
with
his
cudgel,
only
that
the
cur
staggered
away
down
the
road
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him.
He
ran
as
far
as
the
corner,
and
then,
seeing
my
cab,
he
hailed
me
and
jumped
in.
'Drive
me
to
Halliday's
Private
Hotel,'
said
he.
"When
I
had
him
fairly
inside
my
cab,
my
heart
jumped
so
with
joy
that
I
feared
lest
at
this
last
moment
my
aneurism
might
go
wrong.
I
drove
along
slowly,
weighing
in
my
own
mind
what
it
was
best
to
do.
I
might
take
him
right
out
into
the
country,
and
there
in
some
deserted
lane
have
my
last
interview
with
him.
I
had
almost
decided
upon
this,
when
he
solved
the
problem
for
me.
The
craze
for
drink
had
seized
him
again,
and
he
ordered
me
to
pull
up
outside
a
gin
palace.
He
went
in,
leaving
word
that
I
should
wait
for
him.
There
he
remained
until
closing
time,
and
when
he
came
out
he
was
so
far
gone
that
I
knew
the
game
was
in
my
own
hands.
"Don't
imagine
that
I
intended
to
kill
him
in
cold
blood.
It
would
only
have
been
rigid
justice
if
I
had
done
so,
but
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
do
it.
I
had
long
determined
that
he
should
have
a
show
for
his
life
if
he
chose
to
take
advantage
of
it.
Among
the
many
billets
which
I
have
filled
in
America
during
my
wandering
life,
I
was
once
janitor
and
sweeper
out
of
the
laboratory
at
York
College.
One
day
the
professor
was
lecturing
on
poisions,
and
he
showed
his
students
some
alkaloid,
as
he
called
it,
which
he
had
extracted
from
some
South
American
arrow
poison,
and
which
was
so
powerful
that
the
least
grain
meant
instant
death.
I
spotted
the
bottle
in
which
this
preparation
was
kept,
and
when
they
were
all
gone,
I
helped
myself
to
a
little
of
it.
I
was
a
fairly
good
dispenser,
so
I
worked
this
alkaloid
into
small,
soluble
pills,
and
each
pill
I
put
in
a
box
with
a
similar
pill
made
without
the
poison.
I
determined
at
the
time
that
when
I
had
my
chance,
my
gentlemen
should
each
have
a
draw
out
of
one
of
these
boxes,
while
I
ate
the
pill
that
remained.
It
would
be
quite
as
deadly,
and
a
good
deal
less
noisy
than
firing
across
a
handkerchief.
From
that
day
I
had
always
my
pill
boxes
about
with
me,
and
the
time
had
now
come
when
I
was
to
use
them.
"It
was
nearer
one
than
twelve,
and
a
wild,
bleak
night,
blowing
hard
and
raining
in
torrents.
Dismal
as
it
was
outside,
I
was
glad
within
so
glad
that
I
could
have
shouted
out
from
pure
exultation.
If
any
of
you
gentlemen
have
ever
pined
for
a
thing,
and
longed
for
it
during
twenty
long
years,
and
then
suddenly
found
it
within
your
reach,
you
would
understand
my
feelings.
I
lit
a
cigar,
and
puffed
at
it
to
steady
my
nerves,
but
my
hands
were
trembling,
and
my
temples
throbbing
with
excitement.
As
I
drove,
I
could
see
old
John
Ferrier
and
sweet
Lucy
looking
at
me
out
of
the
darkness
and
smiling
at
me,
just
as
plain
as
I
see
you
all
in
this
room.
All
the
way
they
were
ahead
of
me,
one
on
each
side
of
the
horse
until
I
pulled
up
at
the
house
in
the
Brixton
Road.
"There
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen,
nor
a
sound
to
be
heard,
except
the
dripping
of
the
rain.
When
I
looked
in
at
the
window,
I
found
Drebber
all
huddled
together
in
a
drunken
sleep.
I
shook
him
by
the
arm,
'It's
time
to
get
out,'
I
said.
"'All
right,
cabby,'
said
he.
"I
suppose
he
thought
we
had
come
to
the
hotel
that
he
had
mentioned,
for
he
got
out
without
another
word,
and
followed
me
down
the
garden.
I
had
to
walk
beside
him
to
keep
him
steady,
for
he
was
still
a
little
top
heavy.
When
we
came
to
the
door,
I
opened
it,
and
led
him
into
the
front
room.
I
give
you
my
word
that
all
the
way,
the
father
and
the
daughter
were
walking
in
front
of
us.
"'It's
infernally
dark,'
said
he,
stamping
about.
"'We'll
soon
have
a
light,'
I
said,
striking
a
match
and
putting
it
to
a
wax
candle
which
I
had
brought
with
me.
'Now,
Enoch
Drebber,'
I
continued,
turning
to
him,
and
holding
the
light
to
my
own
face,
'who
am
I?'
"He
gazed
at
me
with
bleared,
drunken
eyes
for
a
moment,
and
then
I
saw
a
horror
spring
up
in
them,
and
convulse
his
whole
features,
which
showed
me
that
he
knew
me.
He
staggered
back
with
a
livid
face,
and
I
saw
the
perspiration
break
out
upon
his
brow,
while
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head.
At
the
sight,
I
leaned
my
back
against
the
door
and
laughed
loud
and
long.
I
had
always
known
that
vengeance
would
be
sweet,
but
I
had
never
hoped
for
the
contentment
of
soul
which
now
possessed
me.
"'You
dog!'
I
said;
'I
have
hunted
you
from
Salt
Lake
City
to
St.
Petersburg,
and
you
have
always
escaped
me.
Now,
at
last
your
wanderings
have
come
to
an
end,
for
either
you
or
I
shall
never
see
to
morrow's
sun
rise.'
He
shrunk
still
further
away
as
I
spoke,
and
I
could
see
on
his
face
that
he
thought
I
was
mad.
So
I
was
for
the
time.
The
pulses
in
my
temples
beat
like
sledge
hammers,
and
I
believe
I
would
have
had
a
fit
of
some
sort
if
the
blood
had
not
gushed
from
my
nose
and
relieved
me.
"'What
do
you
think
of
Lucy
Ferrier
now?'
I
cried,
locking
the
door,
and
shaking
the
key
in
his
face.
'Punishment
has
been
slow
in
coming,
but
it
has
overtaken
you
at
last.'
I
saw
his
coward
lips
tremble
as
I
spoke.
He
would
have
begged
for
his
life,
but
he
knew
well
that
it
was
useless.
"'Would
you
murder
me?'
he
stammered.
"'There
is
no
murder,'
I
answered.
'Who
talks
of
murdering
a
mad
dog?
What
mercy
had
you
upon
my
poor
darling,
when
you
dragged
her
from
her
slaughtered
father,
and
bore
her
away
to
your
accursed
and
shameless
harem.'
"'It
was
not
I
who
killed
her
father,'
he
cried.
"'But
it
was
you
who
broke
her
innocent
heart,'
I
shrieked,
thrusting
the
box
before
him.
'Let
the
high
God
judge
between
us.
Choose
and
eat.
There
is
death
in
one
and
life
in
the
other.
I
shall
take
what
you
leave.
Let
us
see
if
there
is
justice
upon
the
earth,
or
if
we
are
ruled
by
chance.'
"He
cowered
away
with
wild
cries
and
prayers
for
mercy,
but
I
drew
my
knife
and
held
it
to
his
throat
until
he
had
obeyed
me.
Then
I
swallowed
the
other,
and
we
stood
facing
one
another
in
silence
for
a
minute
or
more,
waiting
to
see
which
was
to
live
and
which
was
to
die.
Shall
I
ever
forget
the
look
which
came
over
his
face
when
the
first
warning
pangs
told
him
that
the
poison
was
in
his
system?
I
laughed
as
I
saw
it,
and
held
Lucy's
marriage
ring
in
front
of
his
eyes.
It
was
but
for
a
moment,
for
the
action
of
the
alkaloid
is
rapid.
A
spasm
of
pain
contorted
his
features;
he
threw
his
hands
out
in
front
of
him,
staggered,
and
then,
with
a
hoarse
cry,
fell
heavily
upon
the
floor.
I
turned
him
over
with
my
foot,
and
placed
my
hand
upon
his
heart.
There
was
no
movement.
He
was
dead!
"The
blood
had
been
streaming
from
my
nose,
but
I
had
taken
no
notice
of
it.
I
don't
know
what
it
was
that
put
it
into
my
head
to
write
upon
the
wall
with
it.
Perhaps
it
was
some
mischievous
idea
of
setting
the
police
upon
a
wrong
track,
for
I
felt
light
hearted
and
cheerful.
I
remembered
a
German
being
found
in
New
York
with
RACHE
written
up
above
him,
and
it
was
argued
at
the
time
in
the
newspapers
that
the
secret
societies
must
have
done
it.
I
guessed
that
what
puzzled
the
New
Yorkers
would
puzzle
the
Londoners,
so
I
dipped
my
finger
in
my
own
blood
and
printed
it
on
a
convenient
place
on
the
wall.
Then
I
walked
down
to
my
cab
and
found
that
there
was
nobody
about,
and
that
the
night
was
still
very
wild.
I
had
driven
some
distance
when
I
put
my
hand
into
the
pocket
in
which
I
usually
kept
Lucy's
ring,
and
found
that
it
was
not
there.
I
was
thunderstruck
at
this,
for
it
was
the
only
memento
that
I
had
of
her.
Thinking
that
I
might
have
dropped
it
when
I
stooped
over
Drebber's
body,
I
drove
back,
and
leaving
my
cab
in
a
side
street,
I
went
boldly
up
to
the
house
for
I
was
ready
to
dare
anything
rather
than
lose
the
ring.
When
I
arrived
there,
I
walked
right
into
the
arms
of
a
police
officer
who
was
coming
out,
and
only
managed
to
disarm
his
suspicions
by
pretending
to
be
hopelessly
drunk.
"That
was
how
Enoch
Drebber
came
to
his
end.
All
I
had
to
do
then
was
to
do
as
much
for
Stangerson,
and
so
pay
off
John
Ferrier's
debt.
I
knew
that
he
was
staying
at
Halliday's
Private
Hotel,
and
I
hung
about
all
day,
but
he
never
came
out.
fancy
that
he
suspected
something
when
Drebber
failed
to
put
in
an
appearance.
He
was
cunning,
was
Stangerson,
and
always
on
his
guard.
If
he
thought
he
could
keep
me
off
by
staying
indoors
he
was
very
much
mistaken.
I
soon
found
out
which
was
the
window
of
his
bedroom,
and
early
next
morning
I
took
advantage
of
some
ladders
which
were
lying
in
the
lane
behind
the
hotel,
and
so
made
my
way
into
his
room
in
the
grey
of
the
dawn.
I
woke
him
up
and
told
him
that
the
hour
had
come
when
he
was
to
answer
for
the
life
he
had
taken
so
long
before.
I
described
Drebber's
death
to
him,
and
I
gave
him
the
same
choice
of
the
poisoned
pills.
Instead
of
grasping
at
the
chance
of
safety
which
that
offered
him,
he
sprang
from
his
bed
and
flew
at
my
throat.
In
self
defence
I
stabbed
him
to
the
heart.
It
would
have
been
the
same
in
any
case,
for
Providence
would
never
have
allowed
his
guilty
hand
to
pick
out
anything
but
the
poison.
"I
have
little
more
to
say,
and
it's
as
well,
for
I
am
about
done
up.
I
went
on
cabbing
it
for
a
day
or
so,
intending
to
keep
at
it
until
I
could
save
enough
to
take
me
back
to
America.
I
was
standing
in
the
yard
when
a
ragged
youngster
asked
if
there
was
a
cabby
there
called
Jefferson
Hope,
and
said
that
his
cab
was
wanted
by
a
gentleman
at
221B,
Baker
Street.
I
went
round,
suspecting
no
harm,
and
the
next
thing
I
knew,
this
young
man
here
had
the
bracelets
on
my
wrists,
and
as
neatly
snackled
as
ever
I
saw
in
my
life.
That's
the
whole
of
my
story,
gentlemen.
You
may
consider
me
to
be
a
murderer;
but
I
hold
that
I
am
just
as
much
an
officer
of
justice
as
you
are."
So
thrilling
had
the
man's
narrative
been,
and
his
manner
was
so
impressive
that
we
had
sat
silent
and
absorbed.
Even
the
professional
detectives,
blase
as
they
were
in
every
detail
of
crime,
appeared
to
be
keenly
interested
in
the
man's
story.
When
he
finished
we
sat
for
some
minutes
in
a
stillness
which
was
only
broken
by
the
scratching
of
Lestrade's
pencil
as
he
gave
the
finishing
touches
to
his
shorthand
account.
"There
is
only
one
point
on
which
I
should
like
a
little
more
information,"
Sherlock
Holmes
said
at
last.
"Who
was
your
accomplice
who
came
for
the
ring
which
I
advertised?"
The
prisoner
winked
at
my
friend
jocosely.
"I
can
tell
my
own
secrets,"
he
said,
"but
I
don't
get
other
people
into
trouble.
I
saw
your
advertisement,
and
I
thought
it
might
be
a
plant,
or
it
might
be
the
ring
which
I
wanted.
My
friend
volunteered
to
go
and
see.
I
think
you'll
own
he
did
it
smartly."
"Not
a
doubt
of
that,"
said
Holmes
heartily.
"Now,
gentlemen,"
the
Inspector
remarked
gravely,
"the
forms
of
the
law
must
be
complied
with.
On
Thursday
the
prisoner
will
be
brought
before
the
magistrates,
and
your
attendance
will
be
required.
Until
then
I
will
be
responsible
for
him."
He
rang
the
bell
as
he
spoke,
and
Jefferson
Hope
was
led
off
by
a
couple
of
warders,
while
my
friend
and
I
made
our
way
out
of
the
Station
and
took
a
cab
back
to
Baker
Street.
WE
had
all
been
warned
to
appear
before
the
magistrates
upon
the
Thursday;
but
when
the
Thursday
came
there
was
no
occasion
for
our
testimony.
A
higher
Judge
had
taken
the
matter
in
hand,
and
Jefferson
Hope
had
been
summoned
before
a
tribunal
where
strict
justice
would
be
meted
out
to
him.
On
the
very
night
after
his
capture
the
aneurism
burst,
and
he
was
found
in
the
morning
stretched
upon
the
floor
of
the
cell,
with
a
placid
smile
upon
his
face,
as
though
he
had
been
able
in
his
dying
moments
to
look
back
upon
a
useful
life,
and
on
work
well
done.
"Gregson
and
Lestrade
will
be
wild
about
his
death,"
Holmes
remarked,
as
we
chatted
it
over
next
evening.
"Where
will
their
grand
advertisement
be
now?"
"I
don't
see
that
they
had
very
much
to
do
with
his
capture,"
I
answered.
"What
you
do
in
this
world
is
a
matter
of
no
consequence,"
returned
my
companion,
bitterly.
"The
question
is,
what
can
you
make
people
believe
that
you
have
done.
Never
mind,"
he
continued,
more
brightly,
after
a
pause.
"I
would
not
have
missed
the
investigation
for
anything.
There
has
been
no
better
case
within
my
recollection.
Simple
as
it
was,
there
were
several
most
instructive
points
about
it."
"Simple!"
I
ejaculated.
"Well,
really,
it
can
hardly
be
described
as
otherwise,"
said
Sherlock
Holmes,
smiling
at
my
surprise.
"The
proof
of
its
intrinsic
simplicity
is,
that
without
any
help
save
a
few
very
ordinary
deductions
I
was
able
to
lay
my
hand
upon
the
criminal
within
three
days."
"That
is
true,"
said
I.
"I
have
already
explained
to
you
that
what
is
out
of
the
common
is
usually
a
guide
rather
than
a
hindrance.
In
solving
a
problem
of
this
sort,
the
grand
thing
is
to
be
able
to
reason
backwards.
That
is
a
very
useful
accomplishment,
and
a
very
easy
one,
but
people
do
not
practise
it
much.
In
the
every
day
affairs
of
life
it
is
more
useful
to
reason
forwards,
and
so
the
other
comes
to
be
neglected.
There
are
fifty
who
can
reason
synthetically
for
one
who
can
reason
analytically."
"I
confess,"
said
I,
"that
I
do
not
quite
follow
you."
"I
hardly
expected
that
you
would.
Let
me
see
if
I
can
make
it
clearer.
Most
people,
if
you
describe
a
train
of
events
to
them,
will
tell
you
what
the
result
would
be.
They
can
put
those
events
together
in
their
minds,
and
argue
from
them
that
something
will
come
to
pass.
There
are
few
people,
however,
who,
if
you
told
them
a
result,
would
be
able
to
evolve
from
their
own
inner
consciousness
what
the
steps
were
which
led
up
to
that
result.
This
power
is
what
I
mean
when
I
talk
of
reasoning
backwards,
or
analytically."
"I
understand,"
said
I.
"Now
this
was
a
case
in
which
you
were
given
the
result
and
had
to
find
everything
else
for
yourself.
Now
let
me
endeavour
to
show
you
the
different
steps
in
my
reasoning.
To
begin
at
the
beginning.
I
approached
the
house,
as
you
know,
on
foot,
and
with
my
mind
entirely
free
from
all
impressions.
I
naturally
began
by
examining
the
roadway,
and
there,
as
I
have
already
explained
to
you,
I
saw
clearly
the
marks
of
a
cab,
which,
I
ascertained
by
inquiry,
must
have
been
there
during
the
night.
I
satisfied
myself
that
it
was
a
cab
and
not
a
private
carriage
by
the
narrow
gauge
of
the
wheels.
The
ordinary
London
growler
is
considerably
less
wide
than
a
gentleman's
brougham.
"This
was
the
first
point
gained.
I
then
walked
slowly
down
the
garden
path,
which
happened
to
be
composed
of
a
clay
soil,
peculiarly
suitable
for
taking
impressions.
No
doubt
it
appeared
to
you
to
be
a
mere
trampled
line
of
slush,
but
to
my
trained
eyes
every
mark
upon
its
surface
had
a
meaning.
There
is
no
branch
of
detective
science
which
is
so
important
and
so
much
neglected
as
the
art
of
tracing
footsteps.
Happily,
I
have
always
laid
great
stress
upon
it,
and
much
practice
has
made
it
second
nature
to
me.
I
saw
the
heavy
footmarks
of
the
constables,
but
I
saw
also
the
track
of
the
two
men
who
had
first
passed
through
the
garden.
It
was
easy
to
tell
that
they
had
been
before
the
others,
because
in
places
their
marks
had
been
entirely
obliterated
by
the
others
coming
upon
the
top
of
them.
In
this
way
my
second
link
was
formed,
which
told
me
that
the
nocturnal
visitors
were
two
in
number,
one
remarkable
for
his
height
(as
I
calculated
from
the
length
of
his
stride),
and
the
other
fashionably
dressed,
to
judge
from
the
small
and
elegant
impression
left
by
his
boots.
"On
entering
the
house
this
last
inference
was
confirmed.
My
well
booted
man
lay
before
me.
The
tall
one,
then,
had
done
the
murder,
if
murder
there
was.
There
was
no
wound
upon
the
dead
man's
person,
but
the
agitated
expression
upon
his
face
assured
me
that
he
had
foreseen
his
fate
before
it
came
upon
him.
Men
who
die
from
heart
disease,
or
any
sudden
natural
cause,
never
by
any
chance
exhibit
agitation
upon
their
features.
Having
sniffed
the
dead
man's
lips
I
detected
a
slightly
sour
smell,
and
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
had
poison
forced
upon
him.
Again,
I
argued
that
it
had
been
forced
upon
him
from
the
hatred
and
fear
expressed
upon
his
face.
By
the
method
of
exclusion,
I
had
arrived
at
this
result,
for
no
other
hypothesis
would
meet
the
facts.
Do
not
imagine
that
it
was
a
very
unheard
of
idea.
The
forcible
administration
of
poison
is
by
no
means
a
new
thing
in
criminal
annals.
The
cases
of
Dolsky
in
Odessa,
and
of
Leturier
in
Montpellier,
will
occur
at
once
to
any
toxicologist.
"And
now
came
the
great
question
as
to
the
reason
why.
Robbery
had
not
been
the
object
of
the
murder,
for
nothing
was
taken.
Was
it
politics,
then,
or
was
it
a
woman?
That
was
the
question
which
confronted
me.
I
was
inclined
from
the
first
to
the
latter
supposition.
Political
assassins
are
only
too
glad
to
do
their
work
and
to
fly.
This
murder
had,
on
the
contrary,
been
done
most
deliberately,
and
the
perpetrator
had
left
his
tracks
all
over
the
room,
showing
that
he
had
been
there
all
the
time.
It
must
have
been
a
private
wrong,
and
not
a
political
one,
which
called
for
such
a
methodical
revenge.
When
the
inscription
was
discovered
upon
the
wall
I
was
more
inclined
than
ever
to
my
opinion.
The
thing
was
too
evidently
a
blind.
When
the
ring
was
found,
however,
it
settled
the
question.
Clearly
the
murderer
had
used
it
to
remind
his
victim
of
some
dead
or
absent
woman.
It
was
at
this
point
that
I
asked
Gregson
whether
he
had
enquired
in
his
telegram
to
Cleveland
as
to
any
particular
point
in
Mr.
Drebber's
former
career.
He
answered,
you
remember,
in
the
negative.
"I
then
proceeded
to
make
a
careful
examination
of
the
room,
which
confirmed
me
in
my
opinion
as
to
the
murderer's
height,
and
furnished
me
with
the
additional
details
as
to
the
Trichinopoly
cigar
and
the
length
of
his
nails.
I
had
already
come
to
the
conclusion,
since
there
were
no
signs
of
a
struggle,
that
the
blood
which
covered
the
floor
had
burst
from
the
murderer's
nose
in
his
excitement.
I
could
perceive
that
the
track
of
blood
coincided
with
the
track
of
his
feet.
It
is
seldom
that
any
man,
unless
he
is
very
full
blooded,
breaks
out
in
this
way
through
emotion,
so
I
hazarded
the
opinion
that
the
criminal
was
probably
a
robust
and
ruddy
faced
man.
Events
proved
that
I
had
judged
correctly.
"Having
left
the
house,
I
proceeded
to
do
what
Gregson
had
neglected.
I
telegraphed
to
the
head
of
the
police
at
Cleveland,
limiting
my
enquiry
to
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
marriage
of
Enoch
Drebber.
The
answer
was
conclusive.
It
told
me
that
Drebber
had
already
applied
for
the
protection
of
the
law
against
an
old
rival
in
love,
named
Jefferson
Hope,
and
that
this
same
Hope
was
at
present
in
Europe.
I
knew
now
that
I
held
the
clue
to
the
mystery
in
my
hand,
and
all
that
remained
was
to
secure
the
murderer.
"I
had
already
determined
in
my
own
mind
that
the
man
who
had
walked
into
the
house
with
Drebber,
was
none
other
than
the
man
who
had
driven
the
cab.
The
marks
in
the
road
showed
me
that
the
horse
had
wandered
on
in
a
way
which
would
have
been
impossible
had
there
been
anyone
in
charge
of
it.
Where,
then,
could
the
driver
be,
unless
he
were
inside
the
house?
Again,
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
any
sane
man
would
carry
out
a
deliberate
crime
under
the
very
eyes,
as
it
were,
of
a
third
person,
who
was
sure
to
betray
him.
Lastly,
supposing
one
man
wished
to
dog
another
through
London,
what
better
means
could
he
adopt
than
to
turn
cabdriver.
All
these
considerations
led
me
to
the
irresistible
conclusion
that
Jefferson
Hope
was
to
be
found
among
the
jarveys
of
the
Metropolis.
"If
he
had
been
one
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
ceased
to
be.
On
the
contrary,
from
his
point
of
view,
any
sudden
change
would
be
likely
to
draw
attention
to
himself.
He
would,
probably,
for
a
time
at
least,
continue
to
perform
his
duties.
There
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
was
going
under
an
assumed
name.
Why
should
he
change
his
name
in
a
country
where
no
one
knew
his
original
one?
I
therefore
organized
my
Street
Arab
detective
corps,
and
sent
them
systematically
to
every
cab
proprietor
in
London
until
they
ferreted
out
the
man
that
I
wanted.
How
well
they
succeeded,
and
how
quickly
I
took
advantage
of
it,
are
still
fresh
in
your
recollection.
The
murder
of
Stangerson
was
an
incident
which
was
entirely
unexpected,
but
which
could
hardly
in
any
case
have
been
prevented.
Through
it,
as
you
know,
I
came
into
possession
of
the
pills,
the
existence
of
which
I
had
already
surmised.
You
see
the
whole
thing
is
a
chain
of
logical
sequences
without
a
break
or
flaw."
"It
is
wonderful!"
I
cried.
"Your
merits
should
be
publicly
recognized.
You
should
publish
an
account
of
the
case.
If
you
won't,
I
will
for
you."
"You
may
do
what
you
like,
Doctor,"
he
answered.
"See
here!"
he
continued,
handing
a
paper
over
to
me,
"look
at
this!"
It
was
the
Echo
for
the
day,
and
the
paragraph
to
which
he
pointed
was
devoted
to
the
case
in
question.
"The
public,"
it
said,
"have
lost
a
sensational
treat
through
the
sudden
death
of
the
man
Hope,
who
was
suspected
of
the
murder
of
Mr.
Enoch
Drebber
and
of
Mr.
Joseph
Stangerson.
The
details
of
the
case
will
probably
be
never
known
now,
though
we
are
informed
upon
good
authority
that
the
crime
was
the
result
of
an
old
standing
and
romantic
feud,
in
which
love
and
Mormonism
bore
a
part.
It
seems
that
both
the
victims
belonged,
in
their
younger
days,
to
the
Latter
Day
Saints,
and
Hope,
the
deceased
prisoner,
hails
also
from
Salt
Lake
City.
If
the
case
has
had
no
other
effect,
it,
at
least,
brings
out
in
the
most
striking
manner
the
efficiency
of
our
detective
police
force,
and
will
serve
as
a
lesson
to
all
foreigners
that
they
will
do
wisely
to
settle
their
feuds
at
home,
and
not
to
carry
them
on
to
British
soil.
It
is
an
open
secret
that
the
credit
of
this
smart
capture
belongs
entirely
to
the
well
known
Scotland
Yard
officials,
Messrs.
Lestrade
and
Gregson.
The
man
was
apprehended,
it
appears,
in
the
rooms
of
a
certain
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes,
who
has
himself,
as
an
amateur,
shown
some
talent
in
the
detective
line,
and
who,
with
such
instructors,
may
hope
in
time
to
attain
to
some
degree
of
their
skill.
It
is
expected
that
a
testimonial
of
some
sort
will
be
presented
to
the
two
officers
as
a
fitting
recognition
of
their
services."
"Didn't
I
tell
you
so
when
we
started?"
cried
Sherlock
Holmes
with
a
laugh.
"That's
the
result
of
all
our
Study
in
Scarlet:
to
get
them
a
testimonial!"
"Never
mind,"
I
answered,
"I
have
all
the
facts
in
my
journal,
and
the
public
shall
know
them.
In
the
meantime
you
must
make
yourself
contented
by
the
consciousness
of
success,
like
the
Roman
miser
"'Populus
me
sibilat,
