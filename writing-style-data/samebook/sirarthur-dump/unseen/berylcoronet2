not
itself
within
the
grounds
at
all,
being
a
public,
though
little
used,
thoroughfare.
Holmes
left
us
standing
at
the
door
and
walked
slowly
all
round
the
house,
across
the
front,
down
the
tradesmen's
path,
and
so
round
by
the
garden
behind
into
the
stable
lane.
So
long
was
he
that
Mr.
Holder
and
I
went
into
the
dining-room
and
waited
by
the
fire
until
he
should
return.
We
were
sitting
there
in
silence
when
the
door
opened
and
a
young
lady
came
in.
She
was
rather
above
the
middle
height,
slim,
with
dark
hair
and
eyes,
which
seemed
the
darker
against
the
absolute
pallor
of
her
skin.
I
do
not
think
that
I
have
ever
seen
such
deadly
paleness
in
a
woman's
face.
Her
lips,
too,
were
bloodless,
but
her
eyes
were
flushed
with
crying.
As
she
swept
silently
into
the
room
she
impressed
me
with
a
greater
sense
of
grief
than
the
banker
had
done
in
the
morning,
and
it
was
the
more
striking
in
her
as
she
was
evidently
a
woman
of
strong
character,
with
immense
capacity
for
self-restraint.
Disregarding
my
presence,
she
went
straight
to
her
uncle
and
passed
her
hand
over
his
head
with
a
sweet
womanly
caress.
"You
have
given
orders
that
Arthur
should
be
liberated,
have
you
not,
dad?"
she
asked.
"No,
no,
my
girl,
the
matter
must
be
probed
to
the
bottom."
"But
I
am
so
sure
that
he
is
innocent.
You
know
what
woman's
instincts
are.
I
know
that
he
has
done
no
harm
and
that
you
will
be
sorry
for
having
acted
so
harshly."
"Why
is
he
silent,
then,
if
he
is
innocent?"
"Who
knows?
Perhaps
because
he
was
so
angry
that
you
should
suspect
him."
"How
could
I
help
suspecting
him,
when
I
actually
saw
him
with
the
coronet
in
his
hand?"
"Oh,
but
he
had
only
picked
it
up
to
look
at
it.
Oh,
do,
do
take
my
word
for
it
that
he
is
innocent.
Let
the
matter
drop
and
say
no
more.
It
is
so
dreadful
to
think
of
our
dear
Arthur
in
prison!"
"I
shall
never
let
it
drop
until
the
gems
are
found
never,
Mary!
Your
affection
for
Arthur
blinds
you
as
to
the
awful
consequences
to
me.
Far
from
hushing
the
thing
up,
I
have
brought
a
gentleman
down
from
London
to
inquire
more
deeply
into
it."
"This
gentleman?"
she
asked,
facing
round
to
me.
"No,
his
friend.
He
wished
us
to
leave
him
alone.
He
is
round
in
the
stable
lane
now."
"The
stable
lane?"
She
raised
her
dark
eyebrows.
"What
can
he
hope
to
find
there?
Ah!
this,
I
suppose,
is
he.
I
trust,
sir,
that
you
will
succeed
in
proving,
what
I
feel
sure
is
the
truth,
that
my
cousin
Arthur
is
innocent
of
this
crime."
"I
fully
share
your
opinion,
and
I
trust,
with
you,
that
we
may
prove
it,"
returned
Holmes,
going
back
to
the
mat
to
knock
the
snow
from
his
shoes.
"I
believe
I
have
the
honour
of
addressing
Miss
Mary
Holder.
Might
I
ask
you
a
question
or
two?"
"Pray
do,
sir,
if
it
may
help
to
clear
this
horrible
affair
up."
"You
heard
nothing
yourself
last
night?"
"Nothing,
until
my
uncle
here
began
to
speak
loudly.
I
heard
that,
and
I
came
down."
"You
shut
up
the
windows
and
doors
the
night
before.
Did
you
fasten
all
the
windows?"
"Yes."
"Were
they
all
fastened
this
morning?"
"Yes."
"You
have
a
maid
who
has
a
sweetheart?
I
think
that
you
remarked
to
your
uncle
last
night
that
she
had
been
out
to
see
him?"
"Yes,
and
she
was
the
girl
who
waited
in
the
drawing-room,
and
who
may
have
heard
uncle's
remarks
about
the
coronet."
"I
see.
You
infer
that
she
may
have
gone
out
to
tell
her
sweetheart,
and
that
the
two
may
have
planned
the
robbery."
"But
what
is
the
good
of
all
these
vague
theories,"
cried
the
banker
impatiently,
"when
I
have
told
you
that
I
saw
Arthur
with
the
coronet
in
his
hands?"
"Wait
a
little,
Mr.
Holder.
We
must
come
back
to
that.
About
this
girl,
Miss
Holder.
You
saw
her
return
by
the
kitchen
door,
I
presume?"
"Yes;
when
I
went
to
see
if
the
door
was
fastened
for
the
night
I
met
her
slipping
in.
I
saw
the
man,
too,
in
the
gloom."
"Do
you
know
him?"
"Oh,
yes!
he
is
the
green-grocer
who
brings
our
vegetables
round.
His
name
is
Francis
Prosper."
"He
stood,"
said
Holmes,
"to
the
left
of
the
door
that
is
to
say,
farther
up
the
path
than
is
necessary
to
reach
the
door?"
"Yes,
he
did."
"And
he
is
a
man
with
a
wooden
leg?"
Something
like
fear
sprang
up
in
the
young
lady's
expressive
black
eyes.
"Why,
you
are
like
a
magician,"
said
she.
"How
do
you
know
that?"
She
smiled,
but
there
was
no
answering
smile
in
Holmes'
thin,
eager
face.
"I
should
be
very
glad
now
to
go
upstairs,"
said
he.
"I
shall
probably
wish
to
go
over
the
outside
of
the
house
again.
Perhaps
I
had
better
take
a
look
at
the
lower
windows
before
I
go
up."
He
walked
swiftly
round
from
one
to
the
other,
pausing
only
at
the
large
one
which
looked
from
the
hall
onto
the
stable
lane.
This
he
opened
and
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
sill
with
his
powerful
magnifying
lens.
"Now
we
shall
go
upstairs,"
said
he
at
last.
The
banker's
dressing-room
was
a
plainly
furnished
little
chamber,
with
a
grey
carpet,
a
large
bureau,
and
a
long
mirror.
Holmes
went
to
the
bureau
first
and
looked
hard
at
the
lock.
"Which
key
was
used
to
open
it?"
he
asked.
"That
which
my
son
himself
indicated
that
of
the
cupboard
of
the
lumber-room."
"Have
you
it
here?"
"That
is
it
on
the
dressing-table."
Sherlock
Holmes
took
it
up
and
opened
the
bureau.
"It
is
a
noiseless
lock,"
said
he.
"It
is
no
wonder
that
it
did
not
wake
you.
This
case,
I
presume,
contains
the
coronet.
We
must
have
a
look
at
it."
He
opened
the
case,
and
taking
out
the
diadem
he
laid
it
upon
the
table.
It
was
a
magnificent
specimen
of
the
jeweller's
art,
and
the
thirty-six
stones
were
the
finest
that
I
have
ever
seen.
At
one
side
of
the
coronet
was
a
cracked
edge,
where
a
corner
holding
three
gems
had
been
torn
away.
"Now,
Mr.
Holder,"
said
Holmes,
"here
is
the
corner
which
corresponds
to
that
which
has
been
so
unfortunately
lost.
Might
I
beg
that
you
will
break
it
off."
The
banker
recoiled
in
horror.
"I
should
not
dream
of
trying,"
said
he.
"Then
I
will."
Holmes
suddenly
bent
his
strength
upon
it,
but
without
result.
"I
feel
it
give
a
little,"
said
he;
"but,
though
I
am
exceptionally
strong
in
the
fingers,
it
would
take
me
all
my
time
to
break
it.
An
ordinary
man
could
not
do
it.
Now,
what
do
you
think
would
happen
if
I
did
break
it,
Mr.
Holder?
There
would
be
a
noise
like
a
pistol
shot.
Do
you
tell
me
that
all
this
happened
within
a
few
yards
of
your
bed
and
that
you
heard
nothing
of
it?"
"I
do
not
know
what
to
think.
It
is
all
dark
to
me."
"But
perhaps
it
may
grow
lighter
as
we
go.
What
do
you
think,
Miss
Holder?"
"I
confess
that
I
still
share
my
uncle's
perplexity."
"Your
son
had
no
shoes
or
slippers
on
when
you
saw
him?"
"He
had
nothing
on
save
only
his
trousers
and
shirt."
"Thank
you.
We
have
certainly
been
favoured
with
extraordinary
luck
during
this
inquiry,
and
it
will
be
entirely
our
own
fault
if
we
do
not
succeed
in
clearing
the
matter
up.
With
your
permission,
Mr.
Holder,
I
shall
now
continue
my
investigations
outside."
He
went
alone,
at
his
own
request,
for
he
explained
that
any
unnecessary
footmarks
might
make
his
task
more
difficult.
For
an
hour
or
more
he
was
at
work,
returning
at
last
with
his
feet
heavy
with
snow
and
his
features
as
inscrutable
as
ever.
"I
think
that
I
have
seen
now
all
that
there
is
to
see,
Mr.
Holder,"
said
he;
"I
can
serve
you
best
by
returning
to
my
rooms."
"But
the
gems,
Mr.
Holmes.
Where
are
they?"
"I
cannot
tell."
The
banker
wrung
his
hands.
"I
shall
never
see
them
again!"
he
cried.
"And
my
son?
You
give
me
hopes?"
"My
opinion
is
in
no
way
altered."
"Then,
for
God's
sake,
what
was
this
dark
business
which
was
acted
in
my
house
last
night?"
"If
you
can
call
upon
me
at
my
Baker
Street
rooms
to-morrow
morning
between
nine
and
ten
I
shall
be
happy
to
do
what
I
can
to
make
it
clearer.
I
understand
that
you
give
me
carte
blanche
to
act
for
you,
provided
only
that
I
get
back
the
gems,
and
that
you
place
no
limit
on
the
sum
I
may
draw."
"I
would
give
my
fortune
to
have
them
back."
"Very
good.
I
shall
look
into
the
matter
between
this
and
then.
Good-bye;
it
is
just
possible
that
I
may
have
to
come
over
here
again
before
evening."
It
was
obvious
to
me
that
my
companion's
mind
was
now
made
up
about
the
case,
although
what
his
conclusions
were
was
more
than
I
could
even
dimly
imagine.
Several
times
during
our
homeward
journey
I
endeavoured
to
sound
him
upon
the
point,
but
he
always
glided
away
to
some
other
topic,
until
at
last
I
gave
it
over
in
despair.
It
was
not
yet
three
when
we
found
ourselves
in
our
rooms
once
more.
He
hurried
to
his
chamber
and
was
down
again
in
a
few
minutes
dressed
as
a
common
loafer.
With
his
collar
turned
up,
his
shiny,
seedy
coat,
his
red
cravat,
and
his
worn
boots,
he
was
a
perfect
sample
of
the
class.
"I
think
that
this
should
do,"
said
he,
glancing
into
the
glass
above
the
fireplace.
"I
only
wish
that
you
could
come
with
me,
Watson,
but
I
fear
that
it
won't
do.
I
may
be
on
the
trail
in
this
matter,
or
I
may
be
following
a
will-o'-the-wisp,
but
I
shall
soon
know
which
it
is.
I
hope
that
I
may
be
back
in
a
few
hours."
He
cut
a
slice
of
beef
from
the
joint
upon
the
sideboard,
sandwiched
it
between
two
rounds
of
bread,
and
thrusting
this
rude
meal
into
his
pocket
he
started
off
upon
his
expedition.
I
had
just
finished
my
tea
when
he
returned,
evidently
in
excellent
spirits,
swinging
an
old
elastic-sided
boot
in
his
hand.
He
chucked
it
down
into
a
corner
and
helped
himself
to
a
cup
of
tea.
"I
only
looked
in
as
I
passed,"
said
he.
"I
am
going
right
on."
"Where
to?"
"Oh,
to
the
other
side
of
the
West
End.
It
may
be
some
time
before
I
get
back.
Don't
wait
up
for
me
in
case
I
should
be
late."
"How
are
you
getting
on?"
"Oh,
so
so.
Nothing
to
complain
of.
I
have
been
out
to
Streatham
since
I
saw
you
last,
but
I
did
not
call
at
the
house.
It
is
a
very
sweet
little
problem,
and
I
would
not
have
missed
it
for
a
good
deal.
However,
I
must
not
sit
gossiping
here,
but
must
get
these
disreputable
clothes
off
and
return
to
my
highly
respectable
self."
I
could
see
by
his
manner
that
he
had
stronger
reasons
for
satisfaction
than
his
words
alone
would
imply.
His
eyes
twinkled,
and
there
was
even
a
touch
of
colour
upon
his
sallow
cheeks.
He
hastened
upstairs,
and
a
few
minutes
later
I
heard
the
slam
of
the
hall
door,
which
told
me
that
he
was
off
once
more
upon
his
congenial
hunt.
I
waited
until
midnight,
but
there
was
no
sign
of
his
return,
so
I
retired
to
my
room.
It
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
him
to
be
away
for
days
and
nights
on
end
when
he
was
hot
upon
a
scent,
so
that
his
lateness
caused
me
no
surprise.
I
do
not
know
at
what
hour
he
came
in,
but
when
I
came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
there
he
was
with
a
cup
of
coffee
in
one
hand
and
the
paper
in
the
other,
as
fresh
and
trim
as
possible.
"You
will
excuse
my
beginning
without
you,
Watson,"
said
he,
"but
you
remember
that
our
client
has
rather
an
early
appointment
this
morning."
"Why,
it
is
after
nine
now,"
I
answered.
"I
should
not
be
surprised
if
that
were
he.
I
thought
I
heard
a
ring."
It
was,
indeed,
our
friend
the
financier.
I
was
shocked
by
the
change
which
had
come
over
him,
for
his
face
which
was
naturally
of
a
broad
and
massive
mould,
was
now
pinched
and
fallen
in,
while
his
hair
seemed
to
me
at
least
a
shade
whiter.
He
entered
with
a
weariness
and
lethargy
which
was
even
more
painful
than
his
violence
of
the
morning
before,
and
he
dropped
heavily
into
the
armchair
which
I
pushed
forward
for
him.
"I
do
not
know
what
I
have
done
to
be
so
severely
tried,"
said
he.
"Only
two
days
ago
I
was
a
happy
and
prosperous
man,
without
a
care
in
the
world.
Now
I
am
left
to
a
lonely
and
dishonoured
age.
One
sorrow
comes
close
upon
the
heels
of
another.
My
niece,
Mary,
has
deserted
me."
"Deserted
you?"
"Yes.
Her
bed
this
morning
had
not
been
slept
in,
her
room
was
empty,
and
a
note
for
me
lay
upon
the
hall
table.
I
had
said
to
her
last
night,
in
sorrow
and
not
in
anger,
that
if
she
had
married
my
boy
all
might
have
been
well
with
him.
Perhaps
it
was
thoughtless
of
me
to
say
so.
It
is
to
that
remark
that
she
refers
in
this
note:
"'MY
DEAREST
UNCLE:
I
feel
that
I
have
brought
trouble
upon
you,
and
that
if
I
had
acted
differently
this
terrible
misfortune
might
never
have
occurred.
I
cannot,
with
this
thought
in
my
mind,
ever
again
be
happy
under
your
roof,
and
I
feel
that
I
must
leave
you
forever.
Do
not
worry
about
my
future,
for
that
is
provided
for;
and,
above
all,
do
not
search
for
me,
for
it
will
be
fruitless
labour
and
an
ill-service
to
me.
In
life
or
in
death,
I
am
ever
your
loving,
MARY.'
"What
could
she
mean
by
that
note,
Mr.
Holmes?
Do
you
think
it
points
to
suicide?"
"No,
no,
nothing
of
the
kind.
It
is
perhaps
the
best
possible
solution.
I
trust,
Mr.
Holder,
that
you
are
nearing
the
end
of
your
troubles."
"Ha!
You
say
so!
You
have
heard
something,
Mr.
Holmes;
you
have
learned
something!
Where
are
the
gems?"
"You
would
not
think
1000
pounds
apiece
an
excessive
sum
for
them?"
"I
would
pay
ten."
"That
would
be
unnecessary.
Three
thousand
will
cover
the
matter.
And
there
is
a
little
reward,
I
fancy.
Have
you
your
check-book?
Here
is
a
pen.
Better
make
it
out
for
4000
pounds."
With
a
dazed
face
the
banker
made
out
the
required
check.
Holmes
walked
over
to
his
desk,
took
out
a
little
triangular
piece
of
gold
with
three
gems
in
it,
and
threw
it
down
upon
the
table.
With
a
shriek
of
joy
our
client
clutched
it
up.
"You
have
it!"
he
gasped.
"I
am
saved!
I
am
saved!"
The
reaction
of
joy
was
as
passionate
as
his
grief
had
been,
and
he
hugged
his
recovered
gems
to
his
bosom.
"There
is
one
other
thing
you
owe,
Mr.
Holder,"
said
Sherlock
Holmes
rather
sternly.
"Owe!"
He
caught
up
a
pen.
"Name
the
sum,
and
I
will
pay
it."
"No,
the
debt
is
not
to
me.
You
owe
a
very
humble
apology
to
that
noble
lad,
your
son,
who
has
carried
himself
in
this
matter
as
I
should
be
proud
to
see
my
own
son
do,
should
I
ever
chance
to
have
one."
"Then
it
was
not
Arthur
who
took
them?"
"I
told
you
yesterday,
and
I
repeat
to-day,
that
it
was
not."
"You
are
sure
of
it!
Then
let
us
hurry
to
him
at
once
to
let
him
know
that
the
truth
is
known."
"He
knows
it
already.
When
I
had
cleared
it
all
up
I
had
an
interview
with
him,
and
finding
that
he
would
not
tell
me
the
story,
I
told
it
to
him,
on
which
he
had
to
confess
that
I
was
right
and
to
add
the
very
few
details
which
were
not
yet
quite
clear
to
me.
Your
news
of
this
morning,
however,
may
open
his
lips."
"For
heaven's
sake,
tell
me,
then,
what
is
this
extraordinary
mystery!"
"I
will
do
so,
and
I
will
show
you
the
steps
by
which
I
reached
it.
And
let
me
say
to
you,
first,
that
which
it
is
hardest
for
me
to
say
and
for
you
to
hear:
there
has
been
an
understanding
between
Sir
George
Burnwell
and
your
niece
Mary.
They
have
now
fled
together."
"My
Mary?
Impossible!"
"It
is
unfortunately
more
than
possible;
it
is
certain.
Neither
you
nor
your
son
knew
the
true
character
of
this
man
when
you
admitted
him
into
your
family
circle.
He
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
England
a
ruined
gambler,
an
absolutely
desperate
villain,
a
man
without
heart
or
conscience.
Your
niece
knew
nothing
of
such
men.
When
he
breathed
his
vows
to
her,
as
he
had
done
to
a
hundred
before
her,
she
flattered
herself
that
she
alone
had
touched
his
heart.
The
devil
knows
best
what
he
said,
but
at
least
she
became
his
tool
and
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
him
nearly
every
evening."
"I
cannot,
and
I
will
not,
believe
it!"
cried
the
banker
with
an
ashen
face.
"I
will
tell
you,
then,
what
occurred
in
your
house
last
night.
Your
niece,
when
you
had,
as
she
thought,
gone
to
your
room,
slipped
down
and
talked
to
her
lover
through
the
window
which
leads
into
the
stable
lane.
His
footmarks
had
pressed
right
through
the
snow,
so
long
had
he
stood
there.
She
told
him
of
the
coronet.
His
wicked
lust
for
gold
kindled
at
the
news,
and
he
bent
her
to
his
will.
I
have
no
doubt
that
she
loved
you,
but
there
are
women
in
whom
the
love
of
a
lover
extinguishes
all
other
loves,
and
I
think
that
she
must
have
been
one.
She
had
hardly
listened
to
his
instructions
when
she
saw
you
coming
downstairs,
on
which
she
closed
the
window
rapidly
and
told
you
about
one
of
the
servants'
escapade
with
her
wooden-legged
lover,
which
was
all
perfectly
true.
"Your
boy,
Arthur,
went
to
bed
after
his
interview
with
you
but
he
slept
badly
on
account
of
his
uneasiness
about
his
club
debts.
In
the
middle
of
the
night
he
heard
a
soft
tread
pass
his
door,
so
he
rose
and,
looking
out,
was
surprised
to
see
his
cousin
walking
very
stealthily
along
the
passage
until
she
disappeared
into
your
dressing-room.
Petrified
with
astonishment,
the
lad
slipped
on
some
clothes
and
waited
there
in
the
dark
to
see
what
would
come
of
this
strange
affair.
Presently
she
emerged
from
the
room
again,
and
in
the
light
of
the
passage-lamp
your
son
saw
that
she
carried
the
precious
coronet
in
her
hands.
She
passed
down
the
stairs,
and
he,
thrilling
with
horror,
ran
along
and
slipped
behind
the
curtain
near
your
door,
whence
he
could
see
what
passed
in
the
hall
beneath.
He
saw
her
stealthily
open
the
window,
hand
out
the
coronet
to
someone
in
the
gloom,
and
then
closing
it
once
more
hurry
back
to
her
room,
passing
quite
close
to
where
he
stood
hid
behind
the
curtain.
"As
long
as
she
was
on
the
scene
he
could
not
take
any
action
without
a
horrible
exposure
of
the
woman
whom
he
loved.
But
the
instant
that
she
was
gone
he
realised
how
crushing
a
misfortune
this
would
be
for
you,
and
how
all-important
it
was
to
set
it
right.
He
rushed
down,
just
as
he
was,
in
his
bare
feet,
opened
the
window,
sprang
out
into
the
snow,
and
ran
down
the
lane,
where
he
could
see
a
dark
figure
in
the
moonlight.
Sir
George
Burnwell
tried
to
get
away,
but
Arthur
caught
him,
and
there
was
a
struggle
between
them,
your
lad
tugging
at
one
side
of
the
coronet,
and
his
opponent
at
the
other.
In
the
scuffle,
your
son
struck
Sir
George
and
cut
him
over
the
eye.
Then
something
suddenly
snapped,
and
your
son,
finding
that
he
had
the
coronet
in
his
hands,
rushed
back,
closed
the
window,
ascended
to
your
room,
and
had
just
observed
that
the
coronet
had
been
twisted
in
the
struggle
and
was
endeavouring
to
straighten
it
when
you
appeared
upon
the
scene."
"Is
it
possible?"
gasped
the
banker.
"You
then
roused
his
anger
by
calling
him
names
at
a
moment
when
he
felt
that
he
had
deserved
your
warmest
thanks.
He
could
not
explain
the
true
state
of
affairs
without
betraying
one
who
certainly
deserved
little
enough
consideration
at
his
hands.
He
took
the
more
chivalrous
view,
however,
and
preserved
her
secret."
"And
that
was
why
she
shrieked
and
fainted
when
she
saw
the
coronet,"
cried
Mr.
Holder.
"Oh,
my
God!
what
a
blind
fool
I
have
been!
And
his
asking
to
be
allowed
to
go
out
for
five
minutes!
The
dear
fellow
wanted
to
see
if
the
missing
piece
were
at
the
scene
of
the
struggle.
How
cruelly
I
have
misjudged
him!"
"When
I
arrived
at
the
house,"
continued
Holmes,
"I
at
once
went
very
carefully
round
it
to
observe
if
there
were
any
traces
in
the
snow
which
might
help
me.
I
knew
that
none
had
fallen
since
the
evening
before,
and
also
that
there
had
been
a
strong
frost
to
preserve
impressions.
I
passed
along
the
tradesmen's
path,
but
found
it
all
trampled
down
and
indistinguishable.
Just
beyond
it,
however,
at
the
far
side
of
the
kitchen
door,
a
woman
had
stood
and
talked
with
a
man,
whose
round
impressions
on
one
side
showed
that
he
had
a
wooden
leg.
I
could
even
tell
that
they
had
been
disturbed,
for
the
woman
had
run
back
swiftly
to
the
door,
as
was
shown
by
the
deep
toe
and
light
heel
marks,
while
Wooden-leg
had
waited
a
little,
and
then
had
gone
away.
I
thought
at
the
time
that
this
might
be
the
maid
and
her
sweetheart,
of
whom
you
had
already
spoken
to
me,
and
inquiry
showed
it
was
so.
I
passed
round
the
garden
without
seeing
anything
more
than
random
tracks,
which
I
took
to
be
the
police;
but
when
I
got
into
the
stable
lane
a
very
long
and
complex
story
was
written
in
the
snow
in
front
of
me.
"There
was
a
double
line
of
tracks
of
a
booted
man,
and
a
second
double
line
which
I
saw
with
delight
belonged
to
a
man
with
naked
feet.
I
was
at
once
convinced
from
what
you
had
told
me
that
the
latter
was
your
son.
The
first
had
walked
both
ways,
but
the
other
had
run
swiftly,
and
as
his
tread
was
marked
in
places
over
the
depression
of
the
boot,
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
passed
after
the
other.
I
followed
them
up
and
found
they
led
to
the
hall
window,
where
Boots
had
worn
all
the
snow
away
while
waiting.
Then
I
walked
to
the
other
end,
which
was
a
hundred
yards
or
more
down
the
lane.
I
saw
where
Boots
had
faced
round,
where
the
snow
was
cut
up
as
though
there
had
been
a
struggle,
and,
finally,
where
a
few
drops
of
blood
had
fallen,
to
show
me
that
I
was
not
mistaken.
Boots
had
then
run
down
the
lane,
and
another
little
smudge
of
blood
showed
that
it
was
he
who
had
been
hurt.
When
he
came
to
the
highroad
at
the
other
end,
I
found
that
the
pavement
had
been
cleared,
so
there
was
an
end
to
that
clue.
"On
entering
the
house,
however,
I
examined,
as
you
remember,
the
sill
and
framework
of
the
hall
window
with
my
lens,
and
I
could
at
once
see
that
someone
had
passed
out.
I
could
distinguish
the
outline
of
an
instep
where
the
wet
foot
had
been
placed
in
coming
in.
I
was
then
beginning
to
be
able
to
form
an
opinion
as
to
what
had
occurred.
A
man
had
waited
outside
the
window;
someone
had
brought
the
gems;
the
deed
had
been
overseen
by
your
son;
he
had
pursued
the
thief;
had
struggled
with
him;
they
had
each
tugged
at
the
coronet,
their
united
strength
causing
injuries
which
neither
alone
could
have
effected.
He
had
returned
with
the
prize,
but
had
left
a
fragment
in
the
grasp
of
his
opponent.
So
far
I
was
clear.
The
question
now
was,
who
was
the
man
and
who
was
it
brought
him
the
coronet?
"It
is
an
old
maxim
of
mine
that
when
you
have
excluded
the
impossible,
whatever
remains,
however
improbable,
must
be
the
truth.
Now,
I
knew
that
it
was
not
you
who
had
brought
it
down,
so
there
only
remained
your
niece
and
the
maids.
But
if
it
were
the
maids,
why
should
your
son
allow
himself
to
be
accused
in
their
place?
There
could
be
no
possible
reason.
As
he
loved
his
cousin,
however,
there
was
an
excellent
explanation
why
he
should
retain
her
secret
the
more
so
as
the
secret
was
a
disgraceful
one.
When
I
remembered
that
you
had
seen
her
at
that
window,
and
how
she
had
fainted
on
seeing
the
coronet
again,
my
conjecture
became
a
certainty.
"And
who
could
it
be
who
was
her
confederate?
A
lover
evidently,
for
who
else
could
outweigh
the
love
and
gratitude
which
she
must
feel
to
you?
I
knew
that
you
went
out
little,
and
that
your
circle
of
friends
was
a
very
limited
one.
But
among
them
was
Sir
George
Burnwell.
I
had
heard
of
him
before
as
being
a
man
of
evil
reputation
among
women.
It
must
have
been
he
who
wore
those
boots
and
retained
the
missing
gems.
Even
though
he
knew
that
Arthur
had
discovered
him,
he
might
still
flatter
himself
that
he
was
safe,
for
the
lad
could
not
say
a
word
without
compromising
his
own
family.
"Well,
your
own
good
sense
will
suggest
what
measures
I
took
next.
I
went
in
the
shape
of
a
loafer
to
Sir
George's
house,
managed
to
pick
up
an
acquaintance
with
his
valet,
learned
that
his
master
had
cut
his
head
the
night
before,
and,
finally,
at
the
expense
of
six
shillings,
made
all
sure
by
buying
a
pair
of
his
cast-off
shoes.
With
these
I
journeyed
down
to
Streatham
and
saw
that
they
exactly
fitted
the
tracks."
"I
saw
an
ill-dressed
vagabond
in
the
lane
yesterday
evening,"
said
Mr.
Holder.
"Precisely.
It
was
I.
I
found
that
I
had
my
man,
so
I
came
home
and
changed
my
clothes.
It
was
a
delicate
part
which
I
had
to
play
then,
for
I
saw
that
a
prosecution
must
be
avoided
to
avert
scandal,
and
I
knew
that
so
astute
a
villain
would
see
that
our
hands
were
tied
in
the
matter.
I
went
and
saw
him.
At
first,
of
course,
he
denied
everything.
But
when
I
gave
him
every
particular
that
had
occurred,
he
tried
to
bluster
and
took
down
a
life-preserver
from
the
wall.
I
knew
my
man,
however,
and
I
clapped
a
pistol
to
his
head
before
he
could
strike.
Then
he
became
a
little
more
reasonable.
I
told
him
that
we
would
give
him
a
price
for
the
stones
he
held
1000
pounds
apiece.
That
brought
out
the
first
signs
of
grief
that
he
had
shown.
'Why,
dash
it
all!'
said
he,
'I've
let
them
go
at
six
hundred
for
the
three!'
I
soon
managed
to
get
the
address
of
the
receiver
who
had
them,
on
promising
him
that
there
would
be
no
prosecution.
Off
I
set
to
him,
and
after
much
chaffering
I
got
our
stones
at
1000
pounds
apiece.
Then
I
looked
in
upon
your
son,
told
him
that
all
was
right,
and
eventually
got
to
my
bed
about
two
o'clock,
after
what
I
may
call
a
really
hard
day's
work."
"A
day
which
has
saved
England
from
a
great
public
scandal,"
said
the
banker,
rising.
"Sir,
I
cannot
find
words
to
thank
you,
but
you
shall
not
find
me
ungrateful
for
what
you
have
done.
Your
skill
has
indeed
exceeded
all
that
I
have
heard
of
it.
And
now
I
must
fly
to
my
dear
boy
to
apologise
to
him
for
the
wrong
which
I
have
done
him.
As
to
what
you
tell
me
of
poor
Mary,
it
goes
to
my
very
heart.
Not
even
your
skill
can
inform
me
where
she
is
now."
"I
think
that
we
may
safely
say,"
returned
Holmes,
"that
she
is
wherever
Sir
George
Burnwell
is.
It
is
equally
certain,
too,
that
whatever
her
sins
are,
they
will
soon
receive
a
more
than
sufficient
