within
a
stone's
throw
of
the
said
knoll
and
church.
I
found
myself,
in
short,
in
Thornton
Lacey."
"It
sounds
like
it,"
said
Edmund;
"but
which
way
did
you
turn
after
passing
Sewell's
farm?"
"I
answer
no
such
irrelevant
and
insidious
questions;
though
were
I
to
answer
all
that
you
could
put
in
the
course
of
an
hour,
you
would
never
be
able
to
prove
that
it
was
not
Thornton
Lacey
for
such
it
certainly
was."
"You
inquired,
then?"
"No,
I
never
inquire.
But
I
told
a
man
mending
a
hedge
that
it
was
Thornton
Lacey,
and
he
agreed
to
it."
"You
have
a
good
memory.
I
had
forgotten
having
ever
told
you
half
so
much
of
the
place."
Thornton
Lacey
was
the
name
of
his
impending
living,
as
Miss
Crawford
well
knew;
and
her
interest
in
a
negotiation
for
William
Price's
knave
increased.
"Well,"
continued
Edmund,
"and
how
did
you
like
what
you
saw?"
"Very
much
indeed.
You
are
a
lucky
fellow.
There
will
be
work
for
five
summers
at
least
before
the
place
is
liveable."
"No,
no,
not
so
bad
as
that.
The
farmyard
must
be
moved,
I
grant
you;
but
I
am
not
aware
of
anything
else.
The
house
is
by
no
means
bad,
and
when
the
yard
is
removed,
there
may
be
a
very
tolerable
approach
to
it."
"The
farmyard
must
be
cleared
away
entirely,
and
planted
up
to
shut
out
the
blacksmith's
shop.
The
house
must
be
turned
to
front
the
east
instead
of
the
north
the
entrance
and
principal
rooms,
I
mean,
must
be
on
that
side,
where
the
view
is
really
very
pretty;
I
am
sure
it
may
be
done.
And
there
must
be
your
approach,
through
what
is
at
present
the
garden.
You
must
make
a
new
garden
at
what
is
now
the
back
of
the
house;
which
will
be
giving
it
the
best
aspect
in
the
world,
sloping
to
the
south
east.
The
ground
seems
precisely
formed
for
it.
I
rode
fifty
yards
up
the
lane,
between
the
church
and
the
house,
in
order
to
look
about
me;
and
saw
how
it
might
all
be.
Nothing
can
be
easier.
The
meadows
beyond
what
will
be
the
garden,
as
well
as
what
now
is,
sweeping
round
from
the
lane
I
stood
in
to
the
north
east,
that
is,
to
the
principal
road
through
the
village,
must
be
all
laid
together,
of
course;
very
pretty
meadows
they
are,
finely
sprinkled
with
timber.
They
belong
to
the
living,
I
suppose;
if
not,
you
must
purchase
them.
Then
the
stream
something
must
be
done
with
the
stream;
but
I
could
not
quite
determine
what.
I
had
two
or
three
ideas."
"And
I
have
two
or
three
ideas
also,"
said
Edmund,
"and
one
of
them
is,
that
very
little
of
your
plan
for
Thornton
Lacey
will
ever
be
put
in
practice.
I
must
be
satisfied
with
rather
less
ornament
and
beauty.
I
think
the
house
and
premises
may
be
made
comfortable,
and
given
the
air
of
a
gentleman's
residence,
without
any
very
heavy
expense,
and
that
must
suffice
me;
and,
I
hope,
may
suffice
all
who
care
about
me."
Miss
Crawford,
a
little
suspicious
and
resentful
of
a
certain
tone
of
voice,
and
a
certain
half
look
attending
the
last
expression
of
his
hope,
made
a
hasty
finish
of
her
dealings
with
William
Price;
and
securing
his
knave
at
an
exorbitant
rate,
exclaimed,
"There,
I
will
stake
my
last
like
a
woman
of
spirit.
No
cold
prudence
for
me.
I
am
not
born
to
sit
still
and
do
nothing.
If
I
lose
the
game,
it
shall
not
be
from
not
striving
for
it."
The
game
was
hers,
and
only
did
not
pay
her
for
what
she
had
given
to
secure
it.
Another
deal
proceeded,
and
Crawford
began
again
about
Thornton
Lacey.
"My
plan
may
not
be
the
best
possible:
I
had
not
many
minutes
to
form
it
in;
but
you
must
do
a
good
deal.
The
place
deserves
it,
and
you
will
find
yourself
not
satisfied
with
much
less
than
it
is
capable
of.
(Excuse
me,
your
ladyship
must
not
see
your
cards.
There,
let
them
lie
just
before
you.)
The
place
deserves
it,
Bertram.
You
talk
of
giving
it
the
air
of
a
gentleman's
residence.
That
will
be
done
by
the
removal
of
the
farmyard;
for,
independent
of
that
terrible
nuisance,
I
never
saw
a
house
of
the
kind
which
had
in
itself
so
much
the
air
of
a
gentleman's
residence,
so
much
the
look
of
a
something
above
a
mere
parsonage
house
above
the
expenditure
of
a
few
hundreds
a
year.
It
is
not
a
scrambling
collection
of
low
single
rooms,
with
as
many
roofs
as
windows;
it
is
not
cramped
into
the
vulgar
compactness
of
a
square
farmhouse:
it
is
a
solid,
roomy,
mansion
like
looking
house,
such
as
one
might
suppose
a
respectable
old
country
family
had
lived
in
from
generation
to
generation,
through
two
centuries
at
least,
and
were
now
spending
from
two
to
three
thousand
a
year
in."
Miss
Crawford
listened,
and
Edmund
agreed
to
this.
"The
air
of
a
gentleman's
residence,
therefore,
you
cannot
but
give
it,
if
you
do
anything.
But
it
is
capable
of
much
more.
(Let
me
see,
Mary;
Lady
Bertram
bids
a
dozen
for
that
queen;
no,
no,
a
dozen
is
more
than
it
is
worth.
Lady
Bertram
does
not
bid
a
dozen.
She
will
have
nothing
to
say
to
it.
Go
on,
go
on.)
By
some
such
improvements
as
I
have
suggested
(I
do
not
really
require
you
to
proceed
upon
my
plan,
though,
by
the
bye,
I
doubt
anybody's
striking
out
a
better)
you
may
give
it
a
higher
character.
You
may
raise
it
into
a
place.
From
being
the
mere
gentleman's
residence,
it
becomes,
by
judicious
improvement,
the
residence
of
a
man
of
education,
taste,
modern
manners,
good
connexions.
All
this
may
be
stamped
on
it;
and
that
house
receive
such
an
air
as
to
make
its
owner
be
set
down
as
the
great
landholder
of
the
parish
by
every
creature
travelling
the
road;
especially
as
there
is
no
real
squire's
house
to
dispute
the
point
a
circumstance,
between
ourselves,
to
enhance
the
value
of
such
a
situation
in
point
of
privilege
and
independence
beyond
all
calculation.
You
think
with
me,
I
hope"
(turning
with
a
softened
voice
to
Fanny).
"Have
you
ever
seen
the
place?"
Fanny
gave
a
quick
negative,
and
tried
to
hide
her
interest
in
the
subject
by
an
eager
attention
to
her
brother,
who
was
driving
as
hard
a
bargain,
and
imposing
on
her
as
much
as
he
could;
but
Crawford
pursued
with
"No,
no,
you
must
not
part
with
the
queen.
You
have
bought
her
too
dearly,
and
your
brother
does
not
offer
half
her
value.
No,
no,
sir,
hands
off,
hands
off.
Your
sister
does
not
part
with
the
queen.
She
is
quite
determined.
The
game
will
be
yours,"
turning
to
her
again;
"it
will
certainly
be
yours."
"And
Fanny
had
much
rather
it
were
William's,"
said
Edmund,
smiling
at
her.
"Poor
Fanny!
not
allowed
to
cheat
herself
as
she
wishes!"
"Mr.
Bertram,"
said
Miss
Crawford,
a
few
minutes
afterwards,
"you
know
Henry
to
be
such
a
capital
improver,
that
you
cannot
possibly
engage
in
anything
of
the
sort
at
Thornton
Lacey
without
accepting
his
help.
Only
think
how
useful
he
was
at
Sotherton!
Only
think
what
grand
things
were
produced
there
by
our
all
going
with
him
one
hot
day
in
August
to
drive
about
the
grounds,
and
see
his
genius
take
fire.
There
we
went,
and
there
we
came
home
again;
and
what
was
done
there
is
not
to
be
told!"
Fanny's
eyes
were
turned
on
Crawford
for
a
moment
with
an
expression
more
than
grave
even
reproachful;
but
on
catching
his,
were
instantly
withdrawn.
With
something
of
consciousness
he
shook
his
head
at
his
sister,
and
laughingly
replied,
"I
cannot
say
there
was
much
done
at
Sotherton;
but
it
was
a
hot
day,
and
we
were
all
walking
after
each
other,
and
bewildered."
As
soon
as
a
general
buzz
gave
him
shelter,
he
added,
in
a
low
voice,
directed
solely
at
Fanny,
"I
should
be
sorry
to
have
my
powers
of
planning
judged
of
by
the
day
at
Sotherton.
I
see
things
very
differently
now.
Do
not
think
of
me
as
I
appeared
then."
Sotherton
was
a
word
to
catch
Mrs.
Norris,
and
being
just
then
in
the
happy
leisure
which
followed
securing
the
odd
trick
by
Sir
Thomas's
capital
play
and
her
own
against
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Grant's
great
hands,
she
called
out,
in
high
good
humour,
"Sotherton!
Yes,
that
is
a
place,
indeed,
and
we
had
a
charming
day
there.
William,
you
are
quite
out
of
luck;
but
the
next
time
you
come,
I
hope
dear
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Rushworth
will
be
at
home,
and
I
am
sure
I
can
answer
for
your
being
kindly
received
by
both.
Your
cousins
are
not
of
a
sort
to
forget
their
relations,
and
Mr.
Rushworth
is
a
most
amiable
man.
They
are
at
Brighton
now,
you
know;
in
one
of
the
best
houses
there,
as
Mr.
Rushworth's
fine
fortune
gives
them
a
right
to
be.
I
do
not
exactly
know
the
distance,
but
when
you
get
back
to
Portsmouth,
if
it
is
not
very
far
off,
you
ought
to
go
over
and
pay
your
respects
to
them;
and
I
could
send
a
little
parcel
by
you
that
I
want
to
get
conveyed
to
your
cousins."
"I
should
be
very
happy,
aunt;
but
Brighton
is
almost
by
Beachey
Head;
and
if
I
could
get
so
far,
I
could
not
expect
to
be
welcome
in
such
a
smart
place
as
that
poor
scrubby
midshipman
as
I
am."
Mrs.
Norris
was
beginning
an
eager
assurance
of
the
affability
he
might
depend
on,
when
she
was
stopped
by
Sir
Thomas's
saying
with
authority,
"I
do
not
advise
your
going
to
Brighton,
William,
as
I
trust
you
may
soon
have
more
convenient
opportunities
of
meeting;
but
my
daughters
would
be
happy
to
see
their
cousins
anywhere;
and
you
will
find
Mr.
Rushworth
most
sincerely
disposed
to
regard
all
the
connexions
of
our
family
as
his
own."
"I
would
rather
find
him
private
secretary
to
the
First
Lord
than
anything
else,"
was
William's
only
answer,
in
an
undervoice,
not
meant
to
reach
far,
and
the
subject
dropped.
As
yet
Sir
Thomas
had
seen
nothing
to
remark
in
Mr.
Crawford's
behaviour;
but
when
the
whist
table
broke
up
at
the
end
of
the
second
rubber,
and
leaving
Dr.
Grant
and
Mrs.
Norris
to
dispute
over
their
last
play,
he
became
a
looker
on
at
the
other,
he
found
his
niece
the
object
of
attentions,
or
rather
of
professions,
of
a
somewhat
pointed
character.
Henry
Crawford
was
in
the
first
glow
of
another
scheme
about
Thornton
Lacey;
and
not
being
able
to
catch
Edmund's
ear,
was
detailing
it
to
his
fair
neighbour
with
a
look
of
considerable
earnestness.
His
scheme
was
to
rent
the
house
himself
the
following
winter,
that
he
might
have
a
home
of
his
own
in
that
neighbourhood;
and
it
was
not
merely
for
the
use
of
it
in
the
hunting
season
(as
he
was
then
telling
her),
though
that
consideration
had
certainly
some
weight,
feeling
as
he
did
that,
in
spite
of
all
Dr.
Grant's
very
great
kindness,
it
was
impossible
for
him
and
his
horses
to
be
accommodated
where
they
now
were
without
material
inconvenience;
but
his
attachment
to
that
neighbourhood
did
not
depend
upon
one
amusement
or
one
season
of
the
year:
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
having
a
something
there
that
he
could
come
to
at
any
time,
a
little
homestall
at
his
command,
where
all
the
holidays
of
his
year
might
be
spent,
and
he
might
find
himself
continuing,
improving,
and
perfecting
that
friendship
and
intimacy
with
the
Mansfield
Park
family
which
was
increasing
in
value
to
him
every
day.
Sir
Thomas
heard
and
was
not
offended.
There
was
no
want
of
respect
in
the
young
man's
address;
and
Fanny's
reception
of
it
was
so
proper
and
modest,
so
calm
and
uninviting,
that
he
had
nothing
to
censure
in
her.
She
said
little,
assented
only
here
and
there,
and
betrayed
no
inclination
either
of
appropriating
any
part
of
the
compliment
to
herself,
or
of
strengthening
his
views
in
favour
of
Northamptonshire.
Finding
by
whom
he
was
observed,
Henry
Crawford
addressed
himself
on
the
same
subject
to
Sir
Thomas,
in
a
more
everyday
tone,
but
still
with
feeling.
"I
want
to
be
your
neighbour,
Sir
Thomas,
as
you
have,
perhaps,
heard
me
telling
Miss
Price.
May
I
hope
for
your
acquiescence,
and
for
your
not
influencing
your
son
against
such
a
tenant?"
Sir
Thomas,
politely
bowing,
replied,
"It
is
the
only
way,
sir,
in
which
I
could
not
wish
you
established
as
a
permanent
neighbour;
but
I
hope,
and
believe,
that
Edmund
will
occupy
his
own
house
at
Thornton
Lacey.
Edmund,
am
I
saying
too
much?"
Edmund,
on
this
appeal,
had
first
to
hear
what
was
going
on;
but,
on
understanding
the
question,
was
at
no
loss
for
an
answer.
"Certainly,
sir,
I
have
no
idea
but
of
residence.
But,
Crawford,
though
I
refuse
you
as
a
tenant,
come
to
me
as
a
friend.
Consider
the
house
as
half
your
own
every
winter,
and
we
will
add
to
the
stables
on
your
own
improved
plan,
and
with
all
the
improvements
of
your
improved
plan
that
may
occur
to
you
this
spring."
"We
shall
be
the
losers,"
continued
Sir
Thomas.
"His
going,
though
only
eight
miles,
will
be
an
unwelcome
contraction
of
our
family
circle;
but
I
should
have
been
deeply
mortified
if
any
son
of
mine
could
reconcile
himself
to
doing
less.
It
is
perfectly
natural
that
you
should
not
have
thought
much
on
the
subject,
Mr.
Crawford.
But
a
parish
has
wants
and
claims
which
can
be
known
only
by
a
clergyman
constantly
resident,
and
which
no
proxy
can
be
capable
of
satisfying
to
the
same
extent.
Edmund
might,
in
the
common
phrase,
do
the
duty
of
Thornton,
that
is,
he
might
read
prayers
and
preach,
without
giving
up
Mansfield
Park:
he
might
ride
over
every
Sunday,
to
a
house
nominally
inhabited,
and
go
through
divine
service;
he
might
be
the
clergyman
of
Thornton
Lacey
every
seventh
day,
for
three
or
four
hours,
if
that
would
content
him.
But
it
will
not.
He
knows
that
human
nature
needs
more
lessons
than
a
weekly
sermon
can
convey;
and
that
if
he
does
not
live
among
his
parishioners,
and
prove
himself,
by
constant
attention,
their
well
wisher
and
friend,
he
does
very
little
either
for
their
good
or
his
own."
Mr.
Crawford
bowed
his
acquiescence.
"I
repeat
again,"
added
Sir
Thomas,
"that
Thornton
Lacey
is
the
only
house
in
the
neighbourhood
in
which
I
should
not
be
happy
to
wait
on
Mr.
Crawford
as
occupier."
Mr.
Crawford
bowed
his
thanks.
"Sir
Thomas,"
said
Edmund,
"undoubtedly
understands
the
duty
of
a
parish
priest.
We
must
hope
his
son
may
prove
that
he
knows
it
too."
Whatever
effect
Sir
Thomas's
little
harangue
might
really
produce
on
Mr.
Crawford,
it
raised
some
awkward
sensations
in
two
of
the
others,
two
of
his
most
attentive
listeners
Miss
Crawford
and
Fanny.
One
of
whom,
having
never
before
understood
that
Thornton
was
so
soon
and
so
completely
to
be
his
home,
was
pondering
with
downcast
eyes
on
what
it
would
be
not
to
see
Edmund
every
day;
and
the
other,
startled
from
the
agreeable
fancies
she
had
been
previously
indulging
on
the
strength
of
her
brother's
description,
no
longer
able,
in
the
picture
she
had
been
forming
of
a
future
Thornton,
to
shut
out
the
church,
sink
the
clergyman,
and
see
only
the
respectable,
elegant,
modernised,
and
occasional
residence
of
a
man
of
independent
fortune,
was
considering
Sir
Thomas,
with
decided
ill
will,
as
the
destroyer
of
all
this,
and
suffering
the
more
from
that
involuntary
forbearance
which
his
character
and
manner
commanded,
and
from
not
daring
to
relieve
herself
by
a
single
attempt
at
throwing
ridicule
on
his
cause.
All
the
agreeable
of
her
speculation
was
over
for
that
hour.
It
was
time
to
have
done
with
cards,
if
sermons
prevailed;
and
she
was
glad
to
find
it
necessary
to
come
to
a
conclusion,
and
be
able
to
refresh
her
spirits
by
a
change
of
place
and
neighbour.
The
chief
of
the
party
were
now
collected
irregularly
round
the
fire,
and
waiting
the
final
break
up.
William
and
Fanny
were
the
most
detached.
They
remained
together
at
the
otherwise
deserted
card
table,
talking
very
comfortably,
and
not
thinking
of
the
rest,
till
some
of
the
rest
began
to
think
of
them.
Henry
Crawford's
chair
was
the
first
to
be
given
a
direction
towards
them,
and
he
sat
silently
observing
them
for
a
few
minutes;
himself,
in
the
meanwhile,
observed
by
Sir
Thomas,
who
was
standing
in
chat
with
Dr.
Grant.
"This
is
the
assembly
night,"
said
William.
"If
I
were
at
Portsmouth
I
should
be
at
it,
perhaps."
"But
you
do
not
wish
yourself
at
Portsmouth,
William?"
"No,
Fanny,
that
I
do
not.
I
shall
have
enough
of
Portsmouth
and
of
dancing
too,
when
I
cannot
have
you.
And
I
do
not
know
that
there
would
be
any
good
in
going
to
the
assembly,
for
I
might
not
get
a
partner.
The
Portsmouth
girls
turn
up
their
noses
at
anybody
who
has
not
a
commission.
One
might
as
well
be
nothing
as
a
midshipman.
One
is
nothing,
indeed.
You
remember
the
Gregorys;
they
are
grown
up
amazing
fine
girls,
but
they
will
hardly
speak
to
me,
because
Lucy
is
courted
by
a
lieutenant."
"Oh!
shame,
shame!
But
never
mind
it,
William"
(her
own
cheeks
in
a
glow
of
indignation
as
she
spoke).
"It
is
not
worth
minding.
It
is
no
reflection
on
you;
it
is
no
more
than
what
the
greatest
admirals
have
all
experienced,
more
or
less,
in
their
time.
You
must
think
of
that,
you
must
try
to
make
up
your
mind
to
it
as
one
of
the
hardships
which
fall
to
every
sailor's
share,
like
bad
weather
and
hard
living,
only
with
this
advantage,
that
there
will
be
an
end
to
it,
that
there
will
come
a
time
when
you
will
have
nothing
of
that
sort
to
endure.
When
you
are
a
lieutenant!
only
think,
William,
when
you
are
a
lieutenant,
how
little
you
will
care
for
any
nonsense
of
this
kind."
"I
begin
to
think
I
shall
never
be
a
lieutenant,
Fanny.
Everybody
gets
made
but
me."
"Oh!
my
dear
William,
do
not
talk
so;
do
not
be
so
desponding.
My
uncle
says
nothing,
but
I
am
sure
he
will
do
everything
in
his
power
to
get
you
made.
He
knows,
as
well
as
you
do,
of
what
consequence
it
is."
She
was
checked
by
the
sight
of
her
uncle
much
nearer
to
them
than
she
had
any
suspicion
of,
and
each
found
it
necessary
to
talk
of
something
else.
"Are
you
fond
of
dancing,
Fanny?"
"Yes,
very;
only
I
am
soon
tired."
"I
should
like
to
go
to
a
ball
with
you
and
see
you
dance.
Have
you
never
any
balls
at
Northampton?
I
should
like
to
see
you
dance,
and
I'd
dance
with
you
if
you
would,
for
nobody
would
know
who
I
was
here,
and
I
should
like
to
be
your
partner
once
more.
We
used
to
jump
about
together
many
a
time,
did
not
we?
when
the
hand
organ
was
in
the
street?
I
am
a
pretty
good
dancer
in
my
way,
but
I
dare
say
you
are
a
better."
And
turning
to
his
uncle,
who
was
now
close
to
them,
"Is
not
Fanny
a
very
good
dancer,
sir?"
Fanny,
in
dismay
at
such
an
unprecedented
question,
did
not
know
which
way
to
look,
or
how
to
be
prepared
for
the
answer.
Some
very
grave
reproof,
or
at
least
the
coldest
expression
of
indifference,
must
be
coming
to
distress
her
brother,
and
sink
her
to
the
ground.
But,
on
the
contrary,
it
was
no
worse
than,
"I
am
sorry
to
say
that
I
am
unable
to
answer
your
question.
I
have
never
seen
Fanny
dance
since
she
was
a
little
girl;
but
I
trust
we
shall
both
think
she
acquits
herself
like
a
gentlewoman
when
we
do
see
her,
which,
perhaps,
we
may
have
an
opportunity
of
doing
ere
long."
"I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
your
sister
dance,
Mr.
Price,"
said
Henry
Crawford,
leaning
forward,
"and
will
engage
to
answer
every
inquiry
which
you
can
make
on
the
subject,
to
your
entire
satisfaction.
But
I
believe"
(seeing
Fanny
looked
distressed)
"it
must
be
at
some
other
time.
There
is
one
person
in
company
who
does
not
like
to
have
Miss
Price
spoken
of."
True
enough,
he
had
once
seen
Fanny
dance;
and
it
was
equally
true
that
he
would
now
have
answered
for
her
gliding
about
with
quiet,
light
elegance,
and
in
admirable
time;
but,
in
fact,
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
recall
what
her
dancing
had
been,
and
rather
took
it
for
granted
that
she
had
been
present
than
remembered
anything
about
her.
He
passed,
however,
for
an
admirer
of
her
dancing;
and
Sir
Thomas,
by
no
means
displeased,
prolonged
the
conversation
on
dancing
in
general,
and
was
so
well
engaged
in
describing
the
balls
of
Antigua,
and
listening
to
what
his
nephew
could
relate
of
the
different
modes
of
dancing
which
had
fallen
within
his
observation,
that
he
had
not
heard
his
carriage
announced,
and
was
first
called
to
the
knowledge
of
it
by
the
bustle
of
Mrs.
Norris.
"Come,
Fanny,
Fanny,
what
are
you
about?
We
are
going.
Do
not
you
see
your
aunt
is
going?
Quick,
quick!
I
cannot
bear
to
keep
good
old
Wilcox
waiting.
You
should
always
remember
the
coachman
and
horses.
My
dear
Sir
Thomas,
we
have
settled
it
that
the
carriage
should
come
back
for
you,
and
Edmund
and
William."
Sir
Thomas
could
not
dissent,
as
it
had
been
his
own
arrangement,
previously
communicated
to
his
wife
and
sister;
but
that
seemed
forgotten
by
Mrs.
Norris,
who
must
fancy
that
she
settled
it
all
herself.
Fanny's
last
feeling
in
the
visit
was
disappointment:
for
the
shawl
which
Edmund
was
quietly
taking
from
the
servant
to
bring
and
put
round
her
shoulders
was
seized
by
Mr.
Crawford's
quicker
hand,
and
she
was
obliged
to
be
indebted
to
his
more
prominent
attention.
William's
desire
of
seeing
Fanny
dance
made
more
than
a
momentary
impression
on
his
uncle.
The
hope
of
an
opportunity,
which
Sir
Thomas
had
then
given,
was
not
given
to
be
thought
of
no
more.
He
remained
steadily
inclined
to
gratify
so
amiable
a
feeling;
to
gratify
anybody
else
who
might
wish
to
see
Fanny
dance,
and
to
give
pleasure
to
the
young
people
in
general;
and
having
thought
the
matter
over,
and
taken
his
resolution
in
quiet
independence,
the
result
of
it
appeared
the
next
morning
at
breakfast,
when,
after
recalling
and
commending
what
his
nephew
had
said,
he
added,
"I
do
not
like,
William,
that
you
should
leave
Northamptonshire
without
this
indulgence.
It
would
give
me
pleasure
to
see
you
both
dance.
You
spoke
of
the
balls
at
Northampton.
Your
cousins
have
occasionally
attended
them;
but
they
would
not
altogether
suit
us
now.
The
fatigue
would
be
too
much
for
your
aunt.
I
believe
we
must
not
think
of
a
Northampton
ball.
A
dance
at
home
would
be
more
eligible;
and
if
"
"Ah,
my
dear
Sir
Thomas!"
interrupted
Mrs.
Norris,
"I
knew
what
was
coming.
I
knew
what
you
were
going
to
say.
If
dear
Julia
were
at
home,
or
dearest
Mrs.
Rushworth
at
Sotherton,
to
afford
a
reason,
an
occasion
for
such
a
thing,
you
would
be
tempted
to
give
the
young
people
a
dance
at
Mansfield.
I
know
you
would.
If
they
were
at
home
to
grace
the
ball,
a
ball
you
would
have
this
very
Christmas.
Thank
your
uncle,
William,
thank
your
uncle!"
"My
daughters,"
replied
Sir
Thomas,
gravely
interposing,
"have
their
pleasures
at
Brighton,
and
I
hope
are
very
happy;
but
the
dance
which
I
think
of
giving
at
Mansfield
will
be
for
their
cousins.
Could
we
be
all
assembled,
our
satisfaction
would
undoubtedly
be
more
complete,
but
the
absence
of
some
is
not
to
debar
the
others
of
amusement."
Mrs.
Norris
had
not
another
word
to
say.
She
saw
decision
in
his
looks,
and
her
surprise
and
vexation
required
some
minutes'
silence
to
be
settled
into
composure.
A
ball
at
such
a
time!
His
daughters
absent
and
herself
not
consulted!
There
was
comfort,
however,
soon
at
hand.
She
must
be
the
doer
of
everything:
Lady
Bertram
would
of
course
be
spared
all
thought
and
exertion,
and
it
would
all
fall
upon
her.
She
should
have
to
do
the
honours
of
the
evening;
and
this
reflection
quickly
restored
so
much
of
her
good
humour
as
enabled
her
to
join
in
with
the
others,
before
their
happiness
and
thanks
were
all
expressed.
Edmund,
William,
and
Fanny
did,
in
their
different
ways,
look
and
speak
as
much
grateful
pleasure
in
the
promised
ball
as
Sir
Thomas
could
desire.
Edmund's
feelings
were
for
the
other
two.
His
father
had
never
conferred
a
favour
or
shewn
a
kindness
more
to
his
satisfaction.
Lady
Bertram
was
perfectly
quiescent
and
contented,
and
had
no
objections
to
make.
Sir
Thomas
engaged
for
its
giving
her
very
little
trouble;
and
she
assured
him
"that
she
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
the
trouble;
indeed,
she
could
not
imagine
there
would
be
any."
Mrs.
Norris
was
ready
with
her
suggestions
as
to
the
rooms
he
would
think
fittest
to
be
used,
but
found
it
all
prearranged;
and
when
she
would
have
conjectured
and
hinted
about
the
day,
it
appeared
that
the
day
was
settled
too.
Sir
Thomas
had
been
amusing
himself
with
shaping
a
very
complete
outline
of
the
business;
and
as
soon
as
she
would
listen
quietly,
could
read
his
list
of
the
families
to
be
invited,
from
whom
he
calculated,
with
all
necessary
allowance
for
the
shortness
of
the
notice,
to
collect
young
people
enough
to
form
twelve
or
fourteen
couple:
and
could
detail
the
considerations
which
had
induced
him
to
fix
on
the
22nd
as
the
most
eligible
day.
William
was
required
to
be
at
Portsmouth
on
the
24th;
the
22nd
would
therefore
be
the
last
day
of
his
visit;
but
where
the
days
were
so
few
it
would
be
unwise
to
fix
on
any
earlier.
Mrs.
Norris
was
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
thinking
just
the
same,
and
with
having
been
on
the
point
of
proposing
the
22nd
herself,
as
by
far
the
best
day
for
the
purpose.
The
ball
was
now
a
settled
thing,
and
before
the
evening
a
proclaimed
thing
to
all
whom
it
concerned.
Invitations
were
sent
with
despatch,
and
many
a
young
lady
went
to
bed
that
night
with
her
head
full
of
happy
cares
as
well
as
Fanny.
To
her
the
cares
were
sometimes
almost
beyond
the
happiness;
for
young
and
inexperienced,
with
small
means
of
choice
and
no
confidence
in
her
own
taste,
the
"how
she
should
be
dressed"
was
a
point
of
painful
solicitude;
and
the
almost
solitary
ornament
in
her
possession,
a
very
pretty
amber
cross
which
William
had
brought
her
from
Sicily,
was
the
greatest
distress
of
all,
for
she
had
nothing
but
a
bit
of
ribbon
to
fasten
it
to;
and
though
she
had
worn
it
in
that
manner
once,
would
it
be
allowable
at
such
a
time
in
the
midst
of
all
the
rich
ornaments
which
she
supposed
all
the
other
young
ladies
would
appear
in?
And
yet
not
to
wear
it!
William
had
wanted
to
buy
her
a
gold
chain
too,
but
the
purchase
had
been
beyond
his
means,
and
therefore
not
to
wear
the
cross
might
be
mortifying
him.
These
were
anxious
considerations;
enough
to
sober
her
spirits
even
under
the
prospect
of
a
ball
given
principally
for
her
gratification.
The
preparations
meanwhile
went
on,
and
Lady
Bertram
continued
to
sit
on
her
sofa
without
any
inconvenience
from
them.
She
had
some
extra
visits
from
the
housekeeper,
and
her
maid
was
rather
hurried
in
making
up
a
new
dress
for
her:
Sir
Thomas
gave
orders,
and
Mrs.
Norris
ran
about;
but
all
this
gave
her
no
trouble,
and
as
she
had
foreseen,
"there
was,
in
fact,
no
trouble
in
the
business."
Edmund
was
at
this
time
particularly
full
of
cares:
his
mind
being
deeply
occupied
in
the
consideration
of
two
important
events
now
at
hand,
which
were
to
fix
his
fate
in
life
ordination
and
matrimony
events
of
such
a
serious
character
as
to
make
the
ball,
which
would
be
very
quickly
followed
by
one
of
them,
appear
of
less
moment
in
his
eyes
than
in
those
of
any
other
person
in
the
house.
On
the
23rd
he
was
going
to
a
friend
near
Peterborough,
in
the
same
situation
as
himself,
and
they
were
to
receive
ordination
in
the
course
of
the
Christmas
week.
Half
his
destiny
would
then
be
determined,
but
the
other
half
might
not
be
so
very
smoothly
wooed.
His
duties
would
be
established,
but
the
wife
who
was
to
share,
and
animate,
and
reward
those
duties,
might
yet
be
unattainable.
He
knew
his
own
mind,
but
he
was
not
always
perfectly
assured
of
knowing
Miss
Crawford's.
There
were
points
on
which
they
did
not
quite
agree;
there
were
moments
in
which
she
did
not
seem
propitious;
and
though
trusting
altogether
to
her
affection,
so
far
as
to
be
resolved
almost
resolved
on
bringing
it
to
a
decision
within
a
very
short
time,
as
soon
as
the
variety
of
business
before
him
were
arranged,
and
he
knew
what
he
had
to
offer
her,
he
had
many
anxious
feelings,
many
doubting
hours
as
to
the
result.
His
conviction
of
her
regard
for
him
was
sometimes
very
strong;
he
could
look
back
on
a
long
course
of
encouragement,
and
she
was
as
perfect
in
disinterested
attachment
as
in
everything
else.
But
at
other
times
doubt
and
alarm
intermingled
with
his
hopes;
and
when
he
thought
of
her
acknowledged
disinclination
for
privacy
and
retirement,
her
decided
preference
of
a
London
life,
what
could
he
expect
but
a
determined
rejection?
unless
it
were
an
acceptance
even
more
to
be
deprecated,
demanding
such
sacrifices
of
situation
and
employment
on
his
side
as
conscience
must
forbid.
The
issue
of
all
depended
on
one
question.
Did
she
love
him
well
enough
to
forego
what
had
used
to
be
essential
points?
Did
she
love
him
well
enough
to
make
them
no
longer
essential?
And
this
question,
which
he
was
continually
repeating
to
himself,
though
oftenest
answered
with
a
"Yes,"
had
sometimes
its
"No."
Miss
Crawford
was
soon
to
leave
Mansfield,
and
on
this
circumstance
the
"no"
and
the
"yes"
had
been
very
recently
in
alternation.
He
had
seen
her
eyes
sparkle
as
she
spoke
of
the
dear
friend's
letter,
which
claimed
a
long
visit
from
her
in
London,
and
of
the
kindness
of
Henry,
in
engaging
to
remain
where
he
was
till
January,
that
he
might
convey
her
thither;
he
had
heard
her
speak
of
the
pleasure
of
such
a
journey
with
an
animation
which
had
"no"
in
every
tone.
But
this
had
occurred
on
the
first
day
of
its
being
settled,
within
the
first
hour
of
the
burst
of
such
enjoyment,
when
nothing
but
the
friends
she
was
to
visit
was
before
her.
He
had
since
heard
her
express
herself
differently,
with
other
feelings,
more
chequered
feelings:
he
had
heard
her
tell
Mrs.
Grant
that
she
should
leave
her
with
regret;
that
she
began
to
believe
neither
the
friends
nor
the
pleasures
she
was
going
to
were
worth
those
she
left
behind;
and
that
though
she
felt
she
must
go,
and
knew
she
should
enjoy
herself
when
once
away,
she
was
already
looking
forward
to
being
at
Mansfield
again.
Was
there
not
a
"yes"
in
all
this?
With
such
matters
to
ponder
over,
and
arrange,
and
re
arrange,
Edmund
could
not,
on
his
own
account,
think
very
much
of
the
evening
which
the
rest
of
the
family
were
looking
forward
to
with
a
more
equal
degree
of
strong
interest.
Independent
of
his
two
cousins'
enjoyment
in
it,
the
evening
was
to
him
of
no
higher
value
than
any
other
appointed
meeting
of
the
two
families
might
be.
In
every
meeting
there
was
a
hope
of
receiving
farther
confirmation
of
Miss
Crawford's
attachment;
but
the
whirl
of
a
ballroom,
perhaps,
was
not
particularly
favourable
to
the
excitement
or
expression
of
serious
feelings.
To
engage
her
early
for
the
two
first
dances
was
all
the
command
of
individual
happiness
which
he
felt
in
his
power,
and
the
only
preparation
for
the
ball
which
he
could
enter
into,
in
spite
of
all
that
was
passing
around
him
on
the
subject,
from
morning
till
night.
Thursday
was
the
day
of
the
ball;
and
on
Wednesday
morning
Fanny,
still
unable
to
satisfy
herself
as
to
what
she
ought
to
wear,
determined
to
seek
the
counsel
of
the
more
enlightened,
and
apply
to
Mrs.
Grant
and
her
sister,
whose
acknowledged
taste
would
certainly
bear
her
blameless;
and
as
Edmund
and
William
were
gone
to
Northampton,
and
she
had
reason
to
think
Mr.
Crawford
likewise
out,
she
walked
down
to
the
Parsonage
without
much
fear
of
wanting
an
opportunity
for
private
discussion;
and
the
privacy
of
such
a
discussion
was
a
most
important
part
of
it
to
Fanny,
being
more
than
half
ashamed
of
her
own
solicitude.
She
met
Miss
Crawford
within
a
few
yards
of
the
Parsonage,
just
setting
out
to
call
on
her,
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
friend,
though
obliged
to
insist
on
turning
back,
was
unwilling
to
lose
her
walk,
she
explained
her
business
at
once,
and
observed,
that
if
she
would
be
so
kind
as
to
give
her
opinion,
it
might
be
all
talked
over
as
well
without
doors
as
within.
Miss
Crawford
appeared
gratified
by
the
application,
and
after
a
moment's
thought,
urged
Fanny's
returning
with
her
in
a
much
more
cordial
manner
than
before,
and
proposed
their
going
up
into
her
room,
where
they
might
have
a
comfortable
coze,
without
disturbing
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Grant,
who
were
together
in
the
drawing
room.
It
was
just
the
plan
to
suit
Fanny;
and
with
a
great
deal
of
gratitude
on
her
side
for
such
ready
and
kind
attention,
they
proceeded
indoors,
and
upstairs,
and
were
soon
deep
in
the
interesting
subject.
Miss
Crawford,
pleased
with
the
appeal,
gave
her
all
her
best
judgment
and
taste,
made
everything
easy
by
her
suggestions,
and
tried
to
make
everything
agreeable
by
her
encouragement.
The
dress
being
settled
in
all
its
grander
parts
"But
what
shall
you
have
by
way
of
necklace?"
said
Miss
Crawford.
"Shall
not
you
wear
your
brother's
cross?"
And
as
she
spoke
she
was
undoing
a
small
parcel,
which
Fanny
had
observed
in
her
hand
when
they
met.
Fanny
acknowledged
her
wishes
and
doubts
on
this
point:
she
did
not
know
how
either
to
wear
the
cross,
or
to
refrain
from
wearing
it.
She
was
answered
by
having
a
small
trinket
box
placed
before
her,
and
being
requested
to
chuse
from
among
several
gold
chains
and
necklaces.
Such
had
been
the
parcel
with
which
Miss
Crawford
was
provided,
and
such
the
object
of
her
intended
visit:
and
in
the
kindest
manner
she
now
urged
Fanny's
taking
one
for
the
cross
and
to
keep
for
her
sake,
saying
everything
she
could
think
of
to
obviate
the
scruples
which
were
making
Fanny
start
back
at
first
with
a
look
of
horror
at
the
proposal.
"You
see
what
a
collection
I
have,"
said
she;
"more
by
half
than
I
ever
use
or
think
of.
I
do
not
offer
them
as
new.
I
offer
nothing
but
an
old
necklace.
You
must
forgive
the
liberty,
and
oblige
me."
Fanny
still
resisted,
and
from
her
heart.
The
gift
was
too
valuable.
But
Miss
Crawford
persevered,
and
argued
the
case
with
so
much
affectionate
earnestness
through
all
the
heads
of
William
and
the
cross,
and
the
ball,
and
herself,
as
to
be
finally
successful.
Fanny
found
herself
obliged
to
yield,
that
she
might
not
be
accused
of
pride
or
indifference,
or
some
other
littleness;
and
having
with
modest
reluctance
given
her
consent,
proceeded
to
make
the
selection.
She
looked
and
looked,
longing
to
know
which
might
be
least
valuable;
and
was
determined
in
her
choice
at
last,
by
fancying
there
was
one
necklace
more
frequently
placed
before
her
eyes
than
the
rest.
It
was
of
gold,
prettily
worked;
and
though
Fanny
would
have
preferred
a
longer
and
a
plainer
chain
as
more
adapted
for
her
purpose,
she
hoped,
in
fixing
on
this,
to
be
chusing
what
Miss
Crawford
least
wished
to
keep.
Miss
Crawford
smiled
her
perfect
approbation;
and
hastened
to
complete
the
gift
by
putting
the
necklace
round
her,
and
making
her
see
how
well
it
looked.
Fanny
had
not
a
word
to
say
against
its
becomingness,
and,
excepting
what
remained
of
her
scruples,
was
exceedingly
pleased
with
an
acquisition
so
very
apropos.
She
would
rather,
perhaps,
have
been
obliged
to
some
other
person.
But
this
was
an
unworthy
feeling.
Miss
Crawford
had
anticipated
her
wants
with
a
kindness
which
proved
her
a
real
friend.
"When
I
wear
this
necklace
I
shall
always
think
of
you,"
said
she,
"and
feel
how
very
kind
you
were."
"You
must
think
of
somebody
else
too,
when
you
wear
that
necklace,"
replied
Miss
Crawford.
"You
must
think
of
Henry,
for
it
was
his
choice
in
the
first
place.
He
gave
it
to
me,
and
with
the
necklace
I
make
over
to
you
all
the
duty
of
remembering
the
original
giver.
It
is
to
be
a
family
remembrancer.
The
sister
is
not
to
be
in
your
mind
without
bringing
the
brother
too."
Fanny,
in
great
astonishment
and
confusion,
would
have
returned
the
present
instantly.
To
take
what
had
been
the
gift
of
another
person,
of
a
brother
too,
impossible!
it
must
not
be!
and
with
an
eagerness
and
embarrassment
quite
diverting
to
her
companion,
she
laid
down
the
necklace
again
on
its
cotton,
and
seemed
resolved
either
to
take
another
or
none
at
all.
Miss
Crawford
thought
she
had
never
seen
a
prettier
consciousness.
"My
dear
child,"
said
she,
laughing,
"what
are
you
afraid
of?
Do
you
think
Henry
will
claim
the
necklace
as
mine,
and
fancy
you
did
not
come
honestly
by
it?
or
are
you
imagining
he
would
be
too
much
flattered
by
seeing
round
your
lovely
throat
an
ornament
which
his
money
purchased
three
years
ago,
before
he
knew
there
was
such
a
throat
in
the
world?
or
perhaps"
looking
archly
"you
suspect
a
confederacy
between
us,
and
that
what
I
am
now
doing
is
with
his
knowledge
and
at
his
desire?"
With
the
deepest
blushes
Fanny
protested
against
such
a
thought.
"Well,
then,"
replied
Miss
Crawford
more
seriously,
but
without
at
all
believing
her,
"to
convince
me
that
you
suspect
no
trick,
and
are
as
unsuspicious
of
compliment
as
I
have
always
found
you,
take
the
necklace
and
say
no
more
about
it.
Its
being
a
gift
of
my
brother's
need
not
make
the
smallest
difference
in
your
accepting
it,
as
I
assure
you
it
makes
none
in
my
willingness
to
part
with
it.
He
is
always
giving
me
something
or
other.
I
have
such
innumerable
presents
from
him
that
it
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
value
or
for
him
to
remember
half.
And
as
for
this
necklace,
I
do
not
suppose
I
have
worn
it
six
times:
it
is
very
pretty,
but
I
never
think
of
it;
and
though
you
would
be
most
heartily
welcome
to
any
other
in
my
trinket
box,
you
have
happened
to
fix
on
the
very
one
which,
if
I
have
a
choice,
I
would
rather
part
with
and
see
in
your
possession
than
any
other.
Say
no
more
against
it,
I
entreat
you.
Such
a
trifle
is
not
worth
half
so
many
words."
Fanny
dared
not
make
any
farther
opposition;
and
with
renewed
but
less
happy
thanks
accepted
the
necklace
again,
for
there
was
an
expression
in
Miss
Crawford's
eyes
which
she
could
not
be
satisfied
with.
It
was
impossible
for
her
to
be
insensible
of
Mr.
Crawford's
change
of
manners.
She
had
long
seen
it.
He
evidently
tried
to
please
her:
he
was
gallant,
he
was
attentive,
he
was
something
like
what
he
had
been
to
her
cousins:
he
wanted,
she
supposed,
to
cheat
her
of
her
tranquillity
as
he
had
cheated
them;
and
whether
he
might
not
have
some
concern
in
this
necklace
she
could
not
be
convinced
that
he
had
not,
for
Miss
Crawford,
complaisant
as
a
sister,
was
careless
as
a
woman
and
a
friend.
Reflecting
and
doubting,
and
feeling
that
the
possession
of
what
she
had
so
much
wished
for
did
not
bring
much
satisfaction,
she
now
walked
home
again,
with
a
change
rather
than
a
diminution
of
cares
since
her
treading
that
path
before.
On
reaching
home
Fanny
went
immediately
upstairs
to
deposit
this
unexpected
acquisition,
this
doubtful
good
of
a
necklace,
in
some
favourite
box
in
the
East
room,
which
held
all
her
smaller
treasures;
but
on
opening
the
door,
what
was
her
surprise
to
find
her
cousin
Edmund
there
writing
at
the
table!
Such
a
sight
having
never
occurred
before,
was
almost
as
wonderful
as
it
was
welcome.
"Fanny,"
said
he
directly,
leaving
his
seat
and
his
pen,
and
meeting
her
with
something
in
his
hand,
"I
beg
your
pardon
for
being
here.
I
came
to
look
for
you,
and
after
waiting
a
little
while
in
hope
of
your
coming
in,
was
making
use
of
your
inkstand
to
explain
my
errand.
You
will
find
the
beginning
of
a
note
to
yourself;
but
I
can
now
speak
my
business,
which
is
merely
to
beg
your
acceptance
of
this
little
trifle
a
chain
for
William's
cross.
You
ought
to
have
had
it
a
week
ago,
but
there
has
been
a
delay
from
my
brother's
not
being
in
town
by
several
days
so
soon
as
I
expected;
and
I
have
only
just
now
received
it
at
Northampton.
I
hope
you
will
like
the
chain
itself,
Fanny.
I
endeavoured
to
consult
the
simplicity
of
your
taste;
but,
at
any
rate,
I
know
you
will
be
kind
to
my
intentions,
and
consider
it,
as
it
really
is,
a
token
of
the
love
of
one
of
your
oldest
friends."
And
so
saying,
he
was
hurrying
away,
before
Fanny,
overpowered
by
a
thousand
feelings
of
pain
and
pleasure,
could
attempt
to
speak;
but
quickened
by
one
sovereign
wish,
she
then
called
out,
"Oh!
cousin,
stop
a
moment,
pray
stop!"
He
turned
back.
"I
cannot
attempt
to
thank
you,"
she
continued,
in
a
very
agitated
manner;
"thanks
are
out
of
the
question.
I
feel
much
more
than
I
can
possibly
express.
Your
goodness
in
thinking
of
me
in
such
a
way
is
beyond
"
"If
that
is
all
you
have
to
say,
Fanny"
smiling
and
turning
away
again.
"No,
no,
it
is
not.
I
want
to
consult
you."
Almost
unconsciously
she
had
now
undone
the
parcel
he
had
just
put
into
her
hand,
and
seeing
before
her,
in
all
the
niceness
of
jewellers'
packing,
a
plain
gold
chain,
perfectly
simple
and
neat,
she
could
not
help
bursting
forth
again,
"Oh,
this
is
beautiful
indeed!
This
is
the
very
thing,
precisely
what
I
wished
for!
This
is
the
only
ornament
I
have
ever
had
a
desire
to
possess.
It
will
exactly
suit
my
cross.
They
must
and
shall
be
worn
together.
It
comes,
too,
in
such
an
acceptable
moment.
Oh,
cousin,
you
do
not
know
how
acceptable
it
is."
"My
dear
Fanny,
you
feel
these
things
a
great
deal
too
much.
I
am
most
happy
that
you
like
the
chain,
and
that
it
should
be
here
in
time
for
to
morrow;
but
your
thanks
are
far
beyond
the
occasion.
Believe
me,
I
have
no
pleasure
in
the
world
superior
to
that
of
contributing
to
yours.
No,
I
can
safely
say,
I
have
no
pleasure
so
complete,
so
unalloyed.
It
is
without
a
drawback."
Upon
such
expressions
of
affection
Fanny
could
have
lived
an
hour
without
saying
another
word;
but
Edmund,
after
waiting
a
moment,
obliged
her
to
bring
down
her
mind
from
its
heavenly
flight
by
saying,
"But
what
is
it
that
you
want
to
consult
me
about?"
It
was
about
the
necklace,
which
she
was
now
most
earnestly
longing
to
return,
and
hoped
to
obtain
his
approbation
of
her
doing.
She
gave
the
history
of
her
recent
visit,
and
now
her
raptures
might
well
be
over;
for
Edmund
was
so
struck
with
the
circumstance,
so
delighted
with
what
Miss
Crawford
had
done,
so
gratified
by
such
a
coincidence
of
conduct
between
them,
that
Fanny
could
not
but
admit
the
superior
power
of
one
pleasure
over
his
own
mind,
though
it
might
have
its
drawback.
It
was
some
time
before
she
could
get
his
attention
to
her
plan,
or
any
answer
to
her
demand
of
his
opinion:
he
was
in
a
reverie
of
fond
reflection,
uttering
only
now
and
then
a
few
half
sentences
of
praise;
but
when
he
did
awake
and
understand,
he
was
very
decided
in
opposing
what
she
wished.
"Return
the
necklace!
No,
my
dear
Fanny,
upon
no
account.
It
would
be
mortifying
her
severely.
There
can
hardly
be
a
more
unpleasant
sensation
than
the
having
anything
returned
on
our
hands
which
we
have
given
with
a
reasonable
hope
of
its
contributing
to
the
comfort
of
a
friend.
Why
should
she
lose
a
pleasure
which
she
has
shewn
herself
so
deserving
of?"
"If
it
had
been
given
to
me
in
the
first
instance,"
said
Fanny,
"I
should
not
have
thought
of
returning
it;
but
being
her
brother's
present,
is
not
it
fair
to
suppose
that
she
would
rather
not
part
with
it,
when
it
is
not
wanted?"
"She
must
not
suppose
it
not
wanted,
not
acceptable,
at
least:
and
its
having
been
originally
her
brother's
gift
makes
no
difference;
for
as
she
was
not
prevented
from
offering,
nor
you
from
taking
it
on
that
account,
it
ought
not
to
prevent
you
from
keeping
it.
No
doubt
it
is
handsomer
than
mine,
and
fitter
for
a
ballroom."
"No,
it
is
not
handsomer,
not
at
all
handsomer
in
its
way,
and,
for
my
purpose,
not
half
so
fit.
The
chain
will
agree
with
William's
cross
beyond
all
comparison
better
than
the
necklace."
"For
one
night,
Fanny,
for
only
one
night,
if
it
be
a
sacrifice;
I
am
sure
you
will,
upon
consideration,
make
that
sacrifice
rather
than
give
pain
to
one
who
has
been
so
studious
of
your
comfort.
Miss
Crawford's
attentions
to
you
have
been
not
more
than
you
were
justly
entitled
to
I
am
the
last
person
to
think
that
could
be,
but
they
have
been
invariable;
and
to
be
returning
them
with
what
must
have
something
the
air
of
ingratitude,
though
I
know
it
could
never
have
the
meaning,
is
not
in
your
nature,
I
am
sure.
Wear
the
necklace,
as
you
are
engaged
to
do,
to
morrow
evening,
and
let
the
chain,
which
was
not
ordered
with
any
reference
to
the
ball,
be
kept
for
commoner
occasions.
This
is
my
advice.
I
would
not
have
the
shadow
of
a
coolness
between
the
two
whose
intimacy
I
have
been
observing
with
the
greatest
pleasure,
and
in
whose
characters
there
is
so
much
general
resemblance
in
true
generosity
and
natural
delicacy
as
to
make
the
few
slight
differences,
resulting
principally
from
situation,
no
reasonable
hindrance
to
a
perfect
friendship.
I
would
not
have
the
shadow
of
a
coolness
arise,"
he
repeated,
his
voice
sinking
a
little,
"between
the
two
dearest
objects
I
have
on
earth."
He
was
gone
as
he
spoke;
and
Fanny
remained
to
tranquillise
herself
as
she
could.
She
was
one
of
his
two
dearest
that
must
support
her.
But
the
other:
the
first!
She
had
never
heard
him
speak
so
openly
before,
and
though
it
told
her
no
more
than
what
she
had
long
perceived,
it
was
a
stab,
for
it
told
of
his
own
convictions
and
views.
They
were
decided.
He
would
marry
Miss
Crawford.
It
was
a
stab,
in
spite
of
every
long
standing
expectation;
and
she
was
obliged
to
repeat
again
and
again,
that
she
was
one
of
his
two
dearest,
before
the
words
gave
her
any
sensation.
Could
she
believe
Miss
Crawford
to
deserve
him,
it
would
be
oh,
how
different
would
it
be
how
far
more
tolerable!
But
he
was
deceived
in
her:
he
gave
her
merits
which
she
had
not;
her
faults
were
what
they
had
ever
been,
but
he
saw
them
no
longer.
Till
she
had
shed
many
tears
over
this
deception,
Fanny
could
not
subdue
her
agitation;
and
the
dejection
which
followed
could
only
be
relieved
by
the
influence
of
fervent
prayers
for
his
happiness.
It
was
her
intention,
as
she
felt
it
to
be
her
duty,
to
try
to
overcome
all
that
was
excessive,
all
that
bordered
on
selfishness,
in
her
affection
for
Edmund.
To
call
or
to
fancy
it
a
loss,
a
disappointment,
would
be
a
presumption
for
which
she
had
not
words
strong
enough
to
satisfy
her
own
humility.
To
think
of
him
as
Miss
Crawford
might
be
justified
in
thinking,
would
in
her
be
insanity.
To
her
he
could
be
nothing
under
any
circumstances;
nothing
dearer
than
a
friend.
Why
did
such
an
idea
occur
to
her
even
enough
to
be
reprobated
and
forbidden?
It
ought
not
to
have
touched
on
the
confines
of
her
imagination.
She
would
endeavour
to
be
rational,
and
to
deserve
the
right
of
judging
of
Miss
Crawford's
character,
and
the
privilege
of
true
solicitude
for
him
by
a
sound
intellect
and
an
honest
heart.
She
had
all
the
heroism
of
principle,
and
was
determined
to
do
her
duty;
but
having
also
many
of
the
feelings
of
youth
and
nature,
let
her
not
be
much
wondered
at,
if,
after
making
all
these
good
resolutions
on
the
side
of
self
government,
she
seized
the
scrap
of
paper
on
which
Edmund
had
begun
writing
to
her,
as
a
treasure
beyond
all
her
hopes,
and
reading
with
the
tenderest
emotion
these
words,
"My
very
dear
Fanny,
you
must
do
me
the
favour
to
accept"
locked
it
up
with
the
chain,
as
the
dearest
part
of
the
gift.
It
was
the
only
thing
approaching
to
a
letter
which
she
had
ever
received
from
him;
she
might
never
receive
another;
it
was
impossible
that
she
ever
should
receive
another
so
perfectly
gratifying
in
the
occasion
and
the
style.
Two
lines
more
prized
had
never
fallen
from
the
pen
of
the
most
distinguished
author
never
more
completely
blessed
the
researches
of
the
fondest
biographer.
The
enthusiasm
of
a
woman's
love
is
even
beyond
the
biographer's.
To
her,
the
handwriting
itself,
independent
of
anything
it
may
convey,
is
a
blessedness.
Never
were
such
characters
cut
by
any
other
human
being
as
Edmund's
commonest
handwriting
gave!
This
specimen,
written
in
haste
as
it
was,
had
not
a
fault;
and
there
was
a
felicity
in
the
flow
of
the
first
four
words,
in
the
arrangement
of
"My
very
dear
Fanny,"
which
she
could
have
looked
at
for
ever.
Having
regulated
her
thoughts
and
comforted
her
feelings
by
this
happy
mixture
of
reason
and
weakness,
she
was
able
in
due
time
to
go
down
and
resume
her
usual
employments
near
her
aunt
Bertram,
and
pay
her
the
usual
observances
without
any
apparent
want
of
spirits.
Thursday,
predestined
to
hope
and
enjoyment,
came;
and
opened
with
more
kindness
to
Fanny
than
such
self
willed,
unmanageable
days
often
volunteer,
for
soon
after
breakfast
a
very
friendly
note
was
brought
from
Mr.
Crawford
to
William,
stating
that
as
he
found
himself
obliged
to
go
to
London
on
the
morrow
for
a
few
days,
he
could
not
help
trying
to
procure
a
companion;
and
therefore
hoped
that
if
William
could
make
up
his
mind
to
leave
Mansfield
half
a
day
earlier
than
had
been
proposed,
he
would
accept
a
place
in
his
carriage.
Mr.
Crawford
meant
to
be
in
town
by
his
uncle's
accustomary
late
dinner
hour,
and
William
was
invited
to
dine
with
him
at
the
Admiral's.
The
proposal
was
a
very
pleasant
one
to
William
himself,
who
enjoyed
the
idea
of
travelling
post
with
four
horses,
and
such
a
good
humoured,
agreeable
friend;
and,
in
likening
it
to
going
up
with
despatches,
was
saying
at
once
everything
in
favour
of
its
happiness
and
dignity
which
his
imagination
could
suggest;
and
Fanny,
from
a
different
motive,
was
exceedingly
pleased;
for
the
original
plan
was
that
William
should
go
up
by
the
mail
from
Northampton
the
following
night,
which
would
not
have
allowed
him
an
hour's
rest
before
he
must
have
got
into
a
Portsmouth
coach;
and
though
this
offer
of
Mr.
Crawford's
would
rob
her
of
many
hours
of
his
company,
she
was
too
happy
in
having
William
spared
from
the
fatigue
of
such
a
journey,
to
think
of
anything
else.
Sir
Thomas
approved
of
it
for
another
reason.
His
nephew's
introduction
to
Admiral
Crawford
might
be
of
service.
The
Admiral,
he
believed,
had
interest.
Upon
the
whole,
it
was
a
very
joyous
note.
Fanny's
spirits
lived
on
it
half
the
morning,
deriving
some
accession
of
pleasure
from
its
writer
being
himself
to
go
away.
As
for
the
ball,
so
near
at
hand,
she
had
too
many
agitations
and
fears
to
have
half
the
enjoyment
in
anticipation
which
she
ought
to
have
had,
or
must
have
been
supposed
to
have
by
the
many
young
ladies
looking
forward
to
the
same
event
in
situations
more
at
ease,
but
under
circumstances
of
less
novelty,
less
interest,
less
peculiar
gratification,
than
would
be
attributed
to
her.
Miss
Price,
known
only
by
name
to
half
the
people
invited,
was
now
to
make
her
first
appearance,
and
must
be
regarded
as
the
queen
of
the
evening.
Who
could
be
happier
than
Miss
Price?
But
Miss
Price
had
not
been
brought
up
to
the
trade
of
coming
out;
and
had
she
known
in
what
light
this
ball
was,
in
general,
considered
respecting
her,
it
would
very
much
have
lessened
her
comfort
by
increasing
the
fears
she
already
had
of
doing
wrong
and
being
looked
at.
To
dance
without
much
observation
or
any
extraordinary
fatigue,
to
have
strength
and
partners
for
about
half
the
evening,
to
dance
a
little
with
Edmund,
and
not
a
great
deal
with
Mr.
Crawford,
to
see
William
enjoy
himself,
and
be
able
to
keep
away
from
her
aunt
Norris,
was
the
height
of
her
ambition,
and
seemed
to
comprehend
her
greatest
possibility
of
happiness.
As
these
were
the
best
of
her
hopes,
they
could
not
always
prevail;
and
in
the
course
of
a
long
morning,
spent
principally
with
her
two
aunts,
she
was
often
under
the
influence
of
much
less
sanguine
views.
William,
determined
to
make
this
last
day
a
day
of
thorough
enjoyment,
was
out
snipe
shooting;
Edmund,
she
had
too
much
reason
to
suppose,
was
at
the
Parsonage;
and
left
alone
to
bear
the
worrying
of
Mrs.
Norris,
who
was
cross
because
the
housekeeper
would
have
her
own
way
with
the
supper,
and
whom
she
could
not
avoid
though
the
housekeeper
might,
Fanny
was
worn
down
at
last
to
think
everything
an
evil
belonging
to
the
ball,
and
when
sent
off
with
a
parting
worry
to
dress,
moved
as
languidly
towards
her
own
room,
and
felt
as
incapable
of
happiness
as
if
she
had
been
allowed
no
share
in
it.
As
she
walked
slowly
upstairs
she
thought
of
yesterday;
it
had
been
about
the
same
hour
that
she
had
returned
from
the
Parsonage,
and
found
Edmund
in
the
East
room.
"Suppose
I
were
to
find
him
there
again
to
day!"
said
she
to
herself,
in
a
fond
indulgence
of
fancy.
"Fanny,"
said
a
voice
at
that
moment
near
her.
Starting
and
looking
up,
she
saw,
across
the
lobby
she
had
just
reached,
Edmund
himself,
standing
at
the
head
of
a
different
staircase.
He
came
towards
her.
"You
look
tired
and
fagged,
Fanny.
You
have
been
walking
too
far."
"No,
I
have
not
been
out
at
all."
"Then
you
have
had
fatigues
within
doors,
which
are
worse.
You
had
better
have
gone
out."
Fanny,
not
liking
to
complain,
found
it
easiest
to
make
no
answer;
and
though
he
looked
at
her
with
his
usual
kindness,
she
believed
he
had
soon
ceased
to
think
of
her
countenance.
He
did
not
appear
in
spirits:
something
unconnected
with
her
was
probably
amiss.
They
proceeded
upstairs
together,
their
rooms
being
on
the
same
floor
above.
"I
come
from
Dr.
Grant's,"
said
Edmund
presently.
"You
may
guess
my
errand
there,
Fanny."
And
he
looked
so
conscious,
that
Fanny
could
think
but
of
one
errand,
which
turned
her
too
sick
for
speech.
"I
wished
to
engage
Miss
Crawford
for
the
two
first
dances,"
was
the
explanation
that
followed,
and
brought
Fanny
to
life
again,
enabling
her,
as
she
found
she
was
expected
to
speak,
to
utter
something
like
an
inquiry
as
to
the
result.
"Yes,"
he
answered,
"she
is
engaged
to
me;
but"
(with
a
smile
that
did
not
sit
easy)
"she
says
it
is
to
be
the
last
time
that
she
ever
will
dance
with
me.
She
is
not
serious.
I
think,
I
hope,
I
am
sure
she
is
not
serious;
but
I
would
rather
not
hear
it.
She
never
has
danced
with
a
clergyman,
she
says,
and
she
never
will.
For
my
own
sake,
I
could
wish
there
had
been
no
ball
just
at
I
mean
not
this
very
week,
this
very
day;
to
morrow
I
leave
home."
Fanny
struggled
for
speech,
and
said,
"I
am
very
sorry
that
anything
has
occurred
to
distress
you.
This
ought
to
be
a
day
of
pleasure.
My
uncle
meant
it
so."
"Oh
yes,
yes!
and
it
will
be
a
day
of
pleasure.
It
will
all
end
right.
I
am
only
vexed
for
a
moment.
In
fact,
it
is
not
that
I
consider
the
ball
as
ill
timed;
what
does
it
signify?
But,
Fanny,"
stopping
her,
by
taking
her
hand,
and
speaking
low
and
seriously,
"you
know
what
all
this
means.
You
see
how
it
is;
and
could
tell
me,
perhaps
better
than
I
could
tell
you,
how
and
why
I
am
vexed.
Let
me
talk
to
you
a
little.
You
are
a
kind,
kind
listener.
I
have
been
pained
by
her
manner
this
morning,
and
cannot
get
the
better
of
it.
I
know
her
disposition
to
be
as
sweet
and
faultless
as
your
own,
but
the
influence
of
her
former
companions
makes
her
seem
gives
to
her
conversation,
to
her
professed
opinions,
sometimes
a
tinge
of
wrong.
She
does
not
think
evil,
but
she
speaks
it,
speaks
it
in
playfulness;
and
though
I
know
it
to
be
playfulness,
it
grieves
me
to
the
soul."
"The
effect
of
education,"
said
Fanny
gently.
Edmund
could
not
but
agree
to
it.
"Yes,
that
uncle
and
aunt!
They
have
injured
the
finest
mind;
for
sometimes,
Fanny,
I
own
to
you,
it
does
appear
more
than
manner:
it
appears
as
if
the
mind
itself
was
tainted."
Fanny
imagined
this
to
be
an
appeal
to
her
judgment,
and
therefore,
after
a
moment's
consideration,
said,
"If
you
only
want
me
as
a
listener,
cousin,
I
will
be
as
useful
as
I
can;
but
I
am
not
qualified
for
an
adviser.
Do
not
ask
advice
of
me.
I
am
not
competent."
"You
are
right,
Fanny,
to
protest
against
such
an
office,
but
you
need
not
be
afraid.
It
is
a
subject
on
which
I
should
never
ask
advice;
it
is
the
sort
of
subject
on
which
it
had
better
never
be
asked;
and
few,
I
imagine,
do
ask
it,
but
when
they
want
to
be
influenced
against
their
conscience.
I
only
want
to
talk
to
you."
"One
thing
more.
Excuse
the
liberty;
but
take
care
how
you
talk
to
me.
Do
not
tell
me
anything
now,
which
hereafter
you
may
be
sorry
for.
The
time
may
come
"
The
colour
rushed
into
her
cheeks
as
she
spoke.
"Dearest
Fanny!"
cried
Edmund,
pressing
her
hand
to
his
lips
with
almost
as
much
warmth
as
if
it
had
been
Miss
Crawford's,
"you
are
all
considerate
thought!
But
it
is
unnecessary
here.
The
time
will
never
come.
No
such
time
as
you
allude
to
will
ever
come.
I
begin
to
think
it
most
improbable:
the
chances
grow
less
and
less;
and
even
if
it
should,
there
will
be
nothing
to
be
remembered
by
either
you
or
me
that
we
need
be
afraid
of,
for
I
can
never
be
ashamed
of
my
own
scruples;
and
if
they
are
removed,
it
must
be
by
changes
that
will
only
raise
her
character
the
more
by
the
recollection
of
the
faults
she
once
had.
You
are
the
only
being
upon
earth
to
whom
I
should
say
what
I
have
said;
but
you
have
always
known
my
opinion
of
her;
you
can
bear
me
witness,
Fanny,
that
I
have
never
been
blinded.
How
many
a
time
have
we
talked
over
her
little
errors!
You
need
not
fear
me;
I
have
almost
given
up
every
serious
idea
of
her;
but
I
must
be
a
blockhead
indeed,
if,
whatever
befell
me,
I
could
think
of
your
kindness
and
sympathy
without
the
sincerest
gratitude."
He
had
said
enough
to
shake
the
experience
of
eighteen.
He
had
said
enough
to
give
Fanny
some
happier
feelings
than
she
had
lately
known,
and
with
a
brighter
look,
she
answered,
"Yes,
cousin,
I
am
convinced
that
you
would
be
incapable
of
anything
else,
though
perhaps
some
might
not.
I
cannot
be
afraid
of
hearing
anything
you
wish
to
say.
Do
not
check
yourself.
Tell
me
whatever
you
like."
They
were
now
on
the
second
floor,
and
the
appearance
of
a
housemaid
prevented
any
farther
conversation.
For
Fanny's
present
comfort
it
was
concluded,
perhaps,
at
the
happiest
moment:
had
he
been
able
to
talk
another
five
minutes,
there
is
no
saying
that
he
might
not
have
talked
away
all
Miss
Crawford's
faults
and
his
own
despondence.
But
as
it
was,
they
parted
with
looks
on
his
side
of
grateful
affection,
and
with
some
very
precious
sensations
on
hers.
She
had
felt
nothing
like
it
for
hours.
Since
the
first
joy
from
Mr.
Crawford's
note
to
William
had
worn
away,
she
had
been
in
a
state
absolutely
the
reverse;
there
had
been
no
comfort
around,
no
hope
within
her.
Now
everything
was
smiling.
William's
good
fortune
returned
again
upon
her
mind,
and
seemed
of
greater
value
than
at
first.
The
ball,
too
such
an
evening
of
pleasure
before
her!
It
was
now
a
real
animation;
and
she
began
to
dress
for
it
with
much
of
the
happy
flutter
which
belongs
to
a
ball.
All
went
well:
she
did
not
dislike
her
own
looks;
and
when
she
came
to
the
necklaces
again,
her
good
fortune
seemed
complete,
for
upon
trial
the
one
given
her
by
Miss
Crawford
would
by
no
means
go
through
the
ring
of
the
cross.
She
had,
to
oblige
Edmund,
resolved
to
wear
it;
but
it
was
too
large
for
the
purpose.
His,
therefore,
must
be
worn;
and
having,
with
delightful
feelings,
joined
the
chain
and
the
cross
those
memorials
of
the
two
most
beloved
of
her
heart,
those
dearest
tokens
so
formed
for
each
other
by
everything
real
and
imaginary
and
put
them
round
her
neck,
and
seen
and
felt
how
full
of
William
and
Edmund
they
were,
she
was
able,
without
an
effort,
to
resolve
on
wearing
Miss
Crawford's
necklace
too.
She
acknowledged
it
to
be
right.
Miss
Crawford
had
a
claim;
and
when
it
was
no
longer
to
encroach
on,
to
interfere
with
the
stronger
claims,
the
truer
kindness
of
another,
she
could
do
her
justice
even
with
pleasure
to
herself.
The
necklace
really
looked
very
well;
and
Fanny
left
her
room
at
last,
comfortably
satisfied
with
herself
and
all
about
her.
Her
aunt
Bertram
had
recollected
her
on
this
occasion
with
an
unusual
degree
of
wakefulness.
It
had
really
occurred
to
her,
unprompted,
that
Fanny,
preparing
for
a
ball,
might
be
glad
of
better
help
than
the
upper
housemaid's,
and
when
dressed
herself,
she
actually
sent
her
own
maid
to
assist
her;
too
late,
of
course,
to
be
of
any
use.
Mrs.
Chapman
had
just
reached
the
attic
floor,
when
Miss
Price
came
out
of
her
room
completely
dressed,
and
only
civilities
were
necessary;
but
Fanny
felt
her
aunt's
attention
almost
as
much
as
Lady
Bertram
or
Mrs.
Chapman
could
do
themselves.
Her
uncle
and
both
her
aunts
were
in
the
drawing
room
when
Fanny
went
down.
To
the
former
she
was
an
interesting
object,
and
he
saw
with
pleasure
the
general
elegance
of
her
appearance,
and
her
being
in
remarkably
good
looks.
The
neatness
and
propriety
of
her
dress
was
all
that
he
would
allow
himself
to
commend
in
her
presence,
but
upon
her
leaving
the
room
again
soon
afterwards,
he
spoke
of
her
beauty
with
very
decided
praise.
"Yes,"
said
Lady
Bertram,
"she
looks
very
well.
I
sent
Chapman
to
her."
"Look
well!
Oh,
yes!"
cried
Mrs.
Norris,
"she
has
good
reason
to
look
well
with
all
her
advantages:
brought
up
in
this
family
as
she
has
been,
with
all
the
benefit
of
her
cousins'
manners
before
her.
Only
think,
my
dear
Sir
Thomas,
what
extraordinary
advantages
you
and
I
have
been
the
means
of
giving
her.
The
very
gown
you
have
been
taking
notice
of
is
your
own
generous
present
to
her
when
dear
Mrs.
Rushworth
married.
What
would
she
have
been
if
we
had
not
taken
her
by
the
hand?"
Sir
Thomas
said
no
more;
but
when
they
sat
down
to
table
the
eyes
of
the
two
young
men
assured
him
that
the
subject
might
be
gently
touched
again,
when
the
ladies
withdrew,
with
more
success.
Fanny
saw
that
she
was
approved;
and
the
consciousness
of
looking
well
made
her
look
still
better.
From
a
variety
of
causes
she
was
happy,
and
she
was
soon
made
still
happier;
for
in
following
her
aunts
out
of
the
room,
Edmund,
who
was
holding
open
the
door,
said,
as
she
passed
him,
"You
must
dance
with
me,
Fanny;
you
must
keep
two
dances
for
me;
any
two
that
you
like,
except
the
first."
She
had
nothing
more
to
wish
for.
She
had
hardly
ever
been
in
a
state
so
nearly
approaching
high
spirits
in
her
life.
Her
cousins'
former
gaiety
on
the
day
of
a
ball
was
no
longer
surprising
to
her;
she
felt
it
to
be
indeed
very
charming,
and
was
actually
practising
her
steps
about
the
drawing
room
as
long
as
she
could
be
safe
from
the
notice
of
her
aunt
Norris,
who
was
entirely
taken
up
at
first
in
fresh
arranging
and
injuring
the
noble
fire
which
the
butler
had
prepared.
Half
an
hour
followed
that
would
have
been
at
least
languid
under
any
other
circumstances,
but
Fanny's
happiness
still
prevailed.
It
was
but
to
think
of
her
conversation
with
Edmund,
and
what
was
the
restlessness
of
Mrs.
Norris?
What
were
the
yawns
of
Lady
Bertram?
The
gentlemen
joined
them;
and
soon
after
began
the
sweet
expectation
of
a
carriage,
when
a
general
spirit
of
ease
and
enjoyment
seemed
diffused,
and
they
all
stood
about
and
talked
and
laughed,
and
every
moment
had
its
pleasure
and
its
hope.
Fanny
felt
that
there
must
be
a
struggle
in
Edmund's
cheerfulness,
but
it
was
delightful
to
see
the
effort
so
successfully
made.
When
the
carriages
were
really
heard,
when
the
guests
began
really
to
assemble,
her
own
gaiety
of
heart
was
much
subdued:
the
sight
of
so
many
strangers
threw
her
back
into
herself;
and
besides
the
gravity
and
formality
of
the
first
great
circle,
which
the
manners
of
neither
Sir
Thomas
nor
Lady
Bertram
were
of
a
kind
to
do
away,
she
found
herself
occasionally
called
on
to
endure
something
worse.
She
was
introduced
here
and
there
by
her
uncle,
and
forced
to
be
spoken
to,
and
to
curtsey,
and
speak
again.
This
was
a
hard
duty,
and
she
was
never
summoned
to
it
without
looking
at
William,
as
he
walked
about
at
his
ease
in
the
background
of
the
scene,
and
longing
to
be
with
him.
The
entrance
of
the
Grants
and
Crawfords
was
a
favourable
epoch.
The
stiffness
of
the
meeting
soon
gave
way
before
their
popular
manners
and
more
diffused
intimacies:
little
groups
were
formed,
and
everybody
grew
comfortable.
Fanny
felt
the
advantage;
and,
drawing
back
from
the
toils
of
civility,
would
have
been
again
most
happy,
could
she
have
kept
her
eyes
from
wandering
between
Edmund
and
Mary
Crawford.
She
looked
all
loveliness
and
what
might
not
be
the
end
of
it?
Her
own
musings
were
brought
to
an
end
on
perceiving
Mr.
Crawford
before
her,
and
her
thoughts
were
put
into
another
channel
by
his
engaging
her
almost
instantly
for
the
first
two
dances.
Her
happiness
on
this
occasion
was
very
much
a
la
mortal,
finely
chequered.
To
be
secure
of
a
partner
at
first
was
a
most
essential
good
for
the
moment
of
beginning
was
now
growing
seriously
near;
and
she
so
little
understood
her
own
claims
as
to
think
that
if
Mr.
Crawford
had
not
asked
her,
she
must
have
been
the
last
to
be
sought
after,
and
should
have
received
a
partner
only
through
a
series
of
inquiry,
and
bustle,
and
interference,
which
would
have
been
terrible;
but
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
pointedness
in
his
manner
of
asking
her
which
she
did
not
like,
and
she
saw
his
eye
glancing
for
a
moment
at
her
necklace,
with
a
smile
she
thought
there
was
a
smile
which
made
her
blush
and
feel
wretched.
And
though
there
was
no
second
glance
to
disturb
her,
though
his
object
seemed
then
to
be
only
quietly
agreeable,
she
could
not
get
the
better
of
her
embarrassment,
heightened
as
it
was
by
the
idea
of
his
perceiving
it,
and
had
no
composure
till
he
turned
away
to
some
one
else.
Then
she
could
gradually
rise
up
to
the
genuine
satisfaction
of
having
a
partner,
a
voluntary
partner,
secured
against
the
dancing
began.
When
the
company
were
moving
into
the
ballroom,
she
found
herself
for
the
first
time
near
Miss
Crawford,
whose
eyes
and
smiles
were
immediately
and
more
unequivocally
directed
as
her
brother's
had
been,
and
who
was
beginning
to
speak
on
the
subject,
when
Fanny,
anxious
to
get
the
story
over,
hastened
to
give
the
explanation
of
the
second
necklace:
the
real
chain.
Miss
Crawford
listened;
and
all
her
intended
compliments
and
insinuations
to
Fanny
were
forgotten:
she
felt
only
one
thing;
and
her
eyes,
bright
as
they
had
been
before,
shewing
they
could
yet
be
brighter,
she
exclaimed
with
eager
pleasure,
"Did
he?
Did
Edmund?
That
was
like
himself.
No
other
man
would
have
thought
of
it.
I
honour
him
beyond
expression."
And
she
looked
around
as
if
longing
to
tell
him
so.
He
was
not
near,
he
was
attending
a
party
of
ladies
out
of
the
room;
and
Mrs.
Grant
coming
up
to
the
two
girls,
and
taking
an
arm
of
each,
they
followed
with
the
rest.
Fanny's
heart
sunk,
but
there
was
no
leisure
for
thinking
long
even
of
Miss
Crawford's
feelings.
They
were
in
the
ballroom,
the
violins
were
playing,
and
her
mind
was
in
a
flutter
that
forbade
its
fixing
on
anything
serious.
She
must
watch
the
general
arrangements,
and
see
how
everything
was
done.
In
a
few
minutes
Sir
Thomas
came
to
her,
and
asked
if
she
were
engaged;
and
the
"Yes,
sir;
to
Mr.
Crawford,"
was
exactly
what
he
had
intended
to
hear.
Mr.
Crawford
was
not
far
off;
Sir
Thomas
brought
him
to
her,
saying
something
which
discovered
to
Fanny,
that
she
was
to
lead
the
way
and
open
the
ball;
an
idea
that
had
never
occurred
to
her
before.
Whenever
she
had
thought
of
the
minutiae
of
the
evening,
it
had
been
as
a
matter
of
course
that
Edmund
would
begin
with
Miss
Crawford;
and
the
impression
was
so
strong,
that
though
her
uncle
spoke
the
contrary,
she
could
not
help
an
exclamation
of
surprise,
a
hint
of
her
unfitness,
an
entreaty
even
to
be
excused.
To
be
urging
her
opinion
against
Sir
Thomas's
was
a
proof
of
the
extremity
of
the
case;
but
such
was
her
horror
at
the
first
suggestion,
that
she
could
actually
look
him
in
the
face
and
say
that
she
hoped
it
might
be
settled
otherwise;
in
vain,
however:
Sir
Thomas
smiled,
tried
to
encourage
her,
and
then
looked
too
serious,
and
said
too
decidedly,
"It
must
be
so,
my
dear,"
for
her
to
hazard
another
word;
and
she
found
herself
the
next
moment
conducted
by
Mr.
Crawford
to
the
top
of
the
room,
and
standing
there
to
be
joined
by
the
rest
of
the
dancers,
couple
after
couple,
as
they
were
formed.
She
could
hardly
believe
it.
To
be
placed
above
so
many
elegant
young
women!
The
distinction
was
too
great.
It
was
treating
her
like
her
cousins!
And
her
thoughts
flew
to
those
absent
cousins
with
most
unfeigned
and
truly
tender
regret,
that
they
were
not
at
home
to
take
their
own
place
in
the
room,
and
have
their
share
of
a
pleasure
which
would
have
been
so
very
delightful
to
them.
So
often
as
she
had
heard
them
wish
for
a
ball
at
home
as
the
greatest
of
all
felicities!
And
to
have
them
away
when
it
was
given
and
for
her
to
be
opening
the
ball
and
with
Mr.
Crawford
too!
She
hoped
they
would
not
envy
her
that
distinction
now;
but
when
she
looked
back
to
the
state
of
things
in
the
autumn,
to
what
they
had
all
been
to
each
other
when
once
dancing
in
that
house
before,
the
present
arrangement
was
almost
more
than
she
could
understand
herself.
The
ball
began.
It
was
rather
honour
than
happiness
to
Fanny,
for
the
first
dance
at
least:
her
partner
was
in
excellent
spirits,
and
tried
to
impart
them
to
her;
but
she
was
a
great
deal
too
much
frightened
to
have
any
enjoyment
till
she
could
suppose
herself
no
longer
looked
at.
Young,
pretty,
and
gentle,
however,
she
had
no
awkwardnesses
that
were
not
as
good
as
graces,
and
there
were
few
persons
present
that
were
not
disposed
to
praise
her.
She
was
attractive,
she
was
modest,
she
was
Sir
Thomas's
niece,
and
she
was
soon
said
to
be
admired
by
Mr.
Crawford.
It
was
enough
to
give
her
general
favour.
Sir
Thomas
himself
was
watching
her
progress
down
the
dance
with
much
complacency;
he
was
proud
of
his
niece;
and
without
attributing
all
her
personal
beauty,
as
Mrs.
Norris
seemed
to
do,
to
her
transplantation
to
Mansfield,
he
was
pleased
with
himself
for
having
supplied
everything
else:
education
and
manners
she
owed
to
him.
Miss
Crawford
saw
much
of
Sir
Thomas's
thoughts
as
he
stood,
and
having,
in
spite
of
all
his
wrongs
towards
her,
a
general
prevailing
desire
of
recommending
herself
to
him,
took
an
opportunity
of
stepping
aside
to
say
something
agreeable
of
Fanny.
Her
praise
was
warm,
and
he
received
it
as
she
could
wish,
joining
in
it
as
far
as
discretion,
and
politeness,
and
slowness
of
speech
would
allow,
and
certainly
appearing
to
greater
advantage
on
the
subject
than
his
lady
did
soon
afterwards,
when
Mary,
perceiving
her
on
a
sofa
very
near,
turned
round
before
she
began
to
dance,
to
compliment
her
on
Miss
Price's
looks.
"Yes,
she
does
look
very
well,"
was
Lady
Bertram's
placid
reply.
"Chapman
helped
her
to
dress.
I
sent
Chapman
to
her."
Not
but
that
she
was
really
pleased
to
have
Fanny
admired;
but
she
was
so
much
more
struck
with
her
own
kindness
in
sending
Chapman
to
her,
that
she
could
not
get
it
out
of
her
head.
Miss
Crawford
knew
Mrs.
Norris
too
well
to
think
of
gratifying
her
by
commendation
of
Fanny;
to
her,
it
was
as
the
occasion
offered
"Ah!
ma'am,
how
much
we
want
dear
Mrs.
Rushworth
and
Julia
to
night!"
and
Mrs.
Norris
paid
her
with
as
many
smiles
and
courteous
words
as
she
had
time
for,
amid
so
much
occupation
as
she
found
for
herself
in
making
up
card
tables,
giving
hints
to
Sir
Thomas,
and
trying
to
move
all
the
chaperons
to
a
better
part
of
the
room.
Miss
Crawford
blundered
most
towards
Fanny
herself
in
her
intentions
to
please.
She
meant
to
be
giving
her
little
heart
a
happy
flutter,
and
filling
her
with
sensations
of
delightful
self
consequence;
and,
misinterpreting
Fanny's
blushes,
still
thought
she
must
be
doing
so
when
she
went
to
her
after
the
two
first
dances,
and
said,
with
a
significant
look,
"Perhaps
you
can
tell
me
why
my
brother
goes
to
town
to
morrow?
He
says
he
has
business
there,
but
will
not
tell
me
what.
The
first
time
he
ever
denied
me
his
confidence!
But
this
is
what
we
all
come
to.
All
are
supplanted
sooner
or
later.
Now,
I
must
apply
to
you
for
information.
Pray,
what
is
Henry
going
for?"
Fanny
protested
her
ignorance
as
steadily
as
her
embarrassment
allowed.
"Well,
then,"
replied
Miss
Crawford,
laughing,
"I
must
suppose
it
to
be
purely
for
the
pleasure
of
conveying
your
brother,
and
of
talking
of
you
by
the
way."
Fanny
was
confused,
but
it
was
the
confusion
of
discontent;
while
Miss
Crawford
wondered
she
did
not
smile,
and
thought
her
over
anxious,
or
thought
her
odd,
or
thought
her
anything
rather
than
insensible
of
pleasure
in
Henry's
attentions.
Fanny
had
a
good
deal
of
enjoyment
in
the
course
of
the
evening;
but
Henry's
attentions
had
very
little
to
do
with
it.
She
would
much
rather
not
have
been
asked
by
him
again
so
very
soon,
and
she
wished
she
had
not
been
obliged
to
suspect
that
his
previous
inquiries
of
Mrs.
Norris,
about
the
supper
hour,
were
all
for
the
sake
of
securing
her
at
that
part
of
the
evening.
But
it
was
not
to
be
avoided:
he
made
her
feel
that
she
was
the
object
of
all;
though
she
could
not
say
that
it
was
unpleasantly
done,
that
there
was
indelicacy
or
ostentation
in
his
manner;
and
sometimes,
when
he
talked
of
William,
he
was
really
not
unagreeable,
and
shewed
even
a
warmth
of
heart
which
did
him
credit.
But
still
his
attentions
made
no
part
of
her
satisfaction.
She
was
happy
whenever
she
looked
at
William,
and
saw
how
perfectly
he
was
enjoying
himself,
in
every
five
minutes
that
she
could
walk
about
with
him
and
hear
his
account
of
his
partners;
she
was
happy
in
knowing
herself
admired;
and
she
was
happy
in
having
the
two
dances
with
Edmund
still
to
look
forward
to,
during
the
greatest
part
of
the
evening,
her
hand
being
so
eagerly
sought
after
that
her
indefinite
engagement
with
him
was
in
continual
perspective.
She
was
happy
even
when
they
did
take
place;
but
not
from
any
flow
of
spirits
on
his
side,
or
any
such
expressions
of
tender
gallantry
as
had
blessed
the
morning.
His
mind
was
fagged,
and
her
happiness
sprung
from
being
the
friend
with
whom
it
could
find
repose.
"I
am
worn
out
with
civility,"
said
he.
"I
have
been
talking
incessantly
all
night,
and
with
nothing
to
say.
But
with
you,
Fanny,
there
may
be
peace.
You
will
not
want
to
be
talked
to.
Let
us
have
the
luxury
of
silence."
Fanny
would
hardly
even
speak
her
agreement.
A
weariness,
arising
probably,
in
great
measure,
from
the
same
feelings
which
he
had
acknowledged
in
the
morning,
was
peculiarly
to
be
respected,
and
they
went
down
their
two
dances
together
with
such
sober
tranquillity
as
might
satisfy
any
looker
on
that
Sir
Thomas
had
been
bringing
up
no
wife
for
his
younger
son.
The
evening
had
afforded
Edmund
little
pleasure.
Miss
Crawford
had
been
in
gay
spirits
when
they
first
danced
together,
but
it
was
not
her
gaiety
that
could
do
him
good:
it
rather
sank
than
raised
his
comfort;
and
afterwards,
for
he
found
himself
still
impelled
to
seek
her
again,
she
had
absolutely
pained
him
by
her
manner
of
speaking
of
the
profession
to
which
he
was
now
on
the
point
of
belonging.
They
had
talked,
and
they
had
been
silent;
he
had
reasoned,
she
had
ridiculed;
and
they
had
parted
at
last
with
mutual
vexation.
Fanny,
not
able
to
refrain
entirely
from
observing
them,
had
seen
enough
to
be
tolerably
satisfied.
It
was
barbarous
to
be
happy
when
Edmund
was
suffering.
Yet
some
happiness
must
and
would
arise
from
the
very
conviction
that
he
did
suffer.
When
her
two
dances
with
him
were
over,
her
inclination
and
strength
for
more
were
pretty
well
at
an
end;
and
Sir
Thomas,
having
seen
her
walk
rather
than
dance
down
the
shortening
set,
breathless,
and
with
her
hand
at
her
side,
gave
his
orders
for
her
sitting
down
entirely.
From
that
time
Mr.
Crawford
sat
down
likewise.
"Poor
Fanny!"
cried
William,
coming
for
a
moment
to
visit
her,
and
working
away
his
partner's
fan
as
if
for
life,
"how
soon
she
is
knocked
up!
Why,
the
sport
is
but
just
begun.
I
hope
we
shall
keep
it
up
these
two
hours.
How
can
you
be
tired
so
soon?"
"So
soon!
my
good
friend,"
said
Sir
Thomas,
producing
his
watch
with
all
necessary
caution;
"it
is
three
o'clock,
and
your
sister
is
not
used
to
these
sort
of
hours."
"Well,
then,
Fanny,
you
shall
not
get
up
to
morrow
before
I
go.
Sleep
as
long
as
you
can,
and
never
mind
me."
"Oh!
William."
"What!
Did
she
think
of
being
up
before
you
set
off?"
"Oh!
yes,
sir,"
cried
Fanny,
rising
eagerly
from
her
seat
to
be
nearer
her
uncle;
"I
must
get
up
and
breakfast
with
him.
It
will
be
the
last
time,
you
know;
the
last
morning."
"You
had
better
not.
He
is
to
have
breakfasted
and
be
gone
by
half
past
nine.
Mr.
Crawford,
I
think
you
call
for
him
at
half
past
nine?"
Fanny
was
too
urgent,
however,
and
had
too
many
tears
in
her
eyes
for
denial;
and
it
ended
in
a
gracious
"Well,
well!"
which
was
permission.
"Yes,
half
past
nine,"
said
Crawford
to
William
as
the
latter
was
leaving
them,
"and
I
shall
be
punctual,
for
there
will
be
no
kind
sister
to
get
up
for
me."
And
in
a
lower
tone
to
Fanny,
"I
shall
have
only
a
desolate
house
to
hurry
from.
Your
brother
will
find
my
ideas
of
time
and
his
own
very
different
to
morrow."
After
a
short
consideration,
Sir
Thomas
asked
Crawford
to
join
the
early
breakfast
party
in
that
house
instead
of
eating
alone:
he
should
himself
be
of
it;
and
the
readiness
with
which
his
invitation
was
accepted
convinced
him
that
the
suspicions
whence,
he
must
confess
to
himself,
this
very
ball
had
in
great
measure
sprung,
were
well
founded.
Mr.
Crawford
was
in
love
with
Fanny.
He
had
a
pleasing
anticipation
of
what
would
be.
His
niece,
meanwhile,
did
not
thank
him
for
what
he
had
just
done.
She
had
hoped
to
have
William
all
to
herself
the
last
morning.
It
would
have
been
an
unspeakable
indulgence.
But
though
her
wishes
were
overthrown,
there
was
no
spirit
of
murmuring
within
her.
On
the
contrary,
she
was
so
totally
unused
to
have
her
pleasure
consulted,
or
to
have
anything
take
place
at
all
in
the
way
she
could
desire,
that
she
was
more
disposed
to
wonder
and
rejoice
in
having
carried
her
point
so
far,
than
to
repine
at
the
counteraction
which
followed.
Shortly
afterward,
Sir
Thomas
was
again
interfering
a
little
with
her
inclination,
by
advising
her
to
go
immediately
to
bed.
"Advise"
was
his
word,
but
it
was
the
advice
of
absolute
power,
and
she
had
only
to
rise,
and,
with
Mr.
Crawford's
very
cordial
adieus,
pass
quietly
away;
stopping
at
the
entrance
door,
like
the
Lady
of
Branxholm
Hall,
"one
moment
and
no
more,"
to
view
the
happy
scene,
and
take
a
last
look
at
the
five
or
six
determined
couple
who
were
still
hard
at
work;
and
then,
creeping
slowly
up
the
principal
staircase,
pursued
by
the
ceaseless
country
dance,
feverish
with
hopes
and
fears,
soup
and
negus,
sore
footed
and
fatigued,
restless
and
agitated,
yet
feeling,
in
spite
of
everything,
that
a
ball
was
indeed
delightful.
In
thus
sending
her
away,
Sir
Thomas
perhaps
might
not
be
thinking
merely
of
her
health.
It
might
occur
to
him
that
Mr.
Crawford
had
been
sitting
by
her
long
enough,
or
he
might
mean
to
recommend
her
as
a
wife
by
shewing
her
persuadableness.
The
ball
was
over,
and
the
breakfast
was
soon
over
too;
the
last
kiss
was
given,
and
William
was
gone.
Mr.
Crawford
had,
as
he
foretold,
been
very
punctual,
and
short
and
pleasant
had
been
the
meal.
After
seeing
William
to
the
last
moment,
Fanny
walked
back
to
the
breakfast
room
with
a
very
saddened
heart
to
grieve
over
the
melancholy
change;
and
there
her
uncle
kindly
left
her
to
cry
in
peace,
conceiving,
perhaps,
that
the
deserted
chair
of
each
young
man
might
exercise
her
tender
enthusiasm,
and
that
the
remaining
cold
pork
bones
and
mustard
in
William's
plate
might
but
divide
her
feelings
with
the
broken
egg
shells
in
Mr.
Crawford's.
She
sat
and
cried
con
amore
as
her
uncle
intended,
but
it
was
con
amore
fraternal
and
no
other.
William
was
gone,
and
she
now
felt
as
if
she
had
wasted
half
his
visit
in
idle
cares
and
selfish
solicitudes
unconnected
with
him.
Fanny's
disposition
was
such
that
she
could
never
even
think
of
her
aunt
Norris
in
the
meagreness
and
cheerlessness
of
her
own
small
house,
without
reproaching
herself
for
some
little
want
of
attention
to
her
when
they
had
been
last
together;
much
less
could
her
feelings
acquit
her
of
having
done
and
said
and
thought
everything
by
William
that
was
due
to
him
for
a
whole
fortnight.
It
was
a
heavy,
melancholy
day.
Soon
after
the
second
breakfast,
Edmund
bade
them
good
bye
for
a
week,
and
mounted
his
horse
for
Peterborough,
and
then
all
were
gone.
Nothing
remained
of
last
night
but
remembrances,
which
she
had
nobody
to
share
in.
She
talked
to
her
aunt
Bertram
she
must
talk
to
somebody
of
the
ball;
but
her
aunt
had
seen
so
little
of
what
had
passed,
and
had
so
little
curiosity,
that
it
was
heavy
work.
Lady
Bertram
was
not
certain
of
anybody's
dress
or
anybody's
place
at
supper
but
her
own.
"She
could
not
recollect
what
it
was
that
she
had
heard
about
one
of
the
Miss
Maddoxes,
or
what
it
was
that
Lady
Prescott
had
noticed
in
Fanny:
she
was
not
sure
whether
Colonel
Harrison
had
been
talking
of
Mr.
Crawford
or
of
William
when
he
said
he
was
the
finest
young
man
in
the
room
somebody
had
whispered
something
to
her;
she
had
forgot
to
ask
Sir
Thomas
what
it
could
be."
And
these
were
her
longest
speeches
and
clearest
communications:
the
rest
was
only
a
languid
"Yes,
yes;
very
well;
did
you?
did
he?
I
did
not
see
that;
I
should
not
know
one
from
the
other."
This
was
very
bad.
It
was
only
better
than
Mrs.
Norris's
sharp
answers
would
have
been;
but
she
being
gone
home
with
all
the
supernumerary
jellies
to
nurse
a
sick
maid,
there
was
peace
and
good
humour
in
their
little
party,
though
it
could
not
boast
much
beside.
The
evening
was
heavy
like
the
day.
"I
cannot
think
what
is
the
matter
with
me,"
said
Lady
Bertram,
when
the
tea
things
were
removed.
"I
feel
quite
stupid.
It
must
be
sitting
up
so
late
last
night.
Fanny,
you
must
do
something
to
keep
me
awake.
I
cannot
work.
Fetch
the
cards;
I
feel
so
very
stupid."
The
cards
were
brought,
and
Fanny
played
at
cribbage
with
her
aunt
till
bedtime;
and
as
Sir
Thomas
was
reading
to
himself,
no
sounds
were
heard
in
the
room
for
the
next
two
hours
beyond
the
reckonings
of
the
game
"And
that
makes
thirty
one;
four
in
hand
and
eight
in
crib.
You
are
to
deal,
ma'am;
shall
I
deal
for
you?"
Fanny
thought
and
thought
again
of
the
difference
which
twenty
four
hours
had
made
in
that
room,
and
all
that
part
of
the
house.
Last
night
it
had
been
hope
and
smiles,
bustle
and
motion,
noise
and
brilliancy,
in
the
drawing
room,
and
out
of
the
drawing
room,
and
everywhere.
Now
it
was
languor,
and
all
but
solitude.
A
good
night's
rest
improved
her
spirits.
She
could
think
of
William
the
next
day
more
cheerfully;
and
as
the
morning
afforded
her
an
opportunity
of
talking
over
Thursday
night
with
Mrs.
Grant
and
Miss
Crawford,
in
a
very
handsome
style,
with
all
the
heightenings
of
imagination,
and
all
the
laughs
of
playfulness
which
are
so
essential
to
the
shade
of
a
departed
ball,
she
could
afterwards
bring
her
mind
without
much
effort
into
its
everyday
state,
and
easily
conform
to
the
tranquillity
of
the
present
quiet
week.
They
were
indeed
a
smaller
party
than
she
had
ever
known
there
for
a
whole
day
together,
and
he
was
gone
on
whom
the
comfort
and
cheerfulness
of
every
family
meeting
and
every
meal
chiefly
depended.
But
this
must
be
learned
to
be
endured.
He
would
soon
be
always
gone;
and
she
was
thankful
that
she
could
now
sit
in
the
same
room
with
her
uncle,
hear
his
voice,
receive
his
questions,
and
even
answer
them,
without
such
wretched
feelings
as
she
had
formerly
known.
"We
miss
our
two
young
men,"
was
Sir
Thomas's
observation
on
both
the
first
and
second
day,
as
they
formed
their
very
reduced
circle
after
dinner;
and
in
consideration
of
Fanny's
swimming
eyes,
nothing
more
was
said
on
the
first
day
than
to
drink
their
good
health;
but
on
the
second
it
led
to
something
farther.
William
was
kindly
commended
and
his
promotion
hoped
for.
"And
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose,"
added
Sir
Thomas,
"but
that
his
visits
to
us
may
now
be
tolerably
frequent.
As
to
Edmund,
we
must
learn
to
do
without
him.
This
will
be
the
last
winter
of
his
belonging
to
us,
as
he
has
done."
"Yes,"
said
Lady
Bertram,
"but
I
wish
he
was
not
going
away.
They
are
all
going
away,
I
think.
I
wish
they
would
stay
at
home."
This
wish
was
levelled
principally
at
Julia,
who
had
just
applied
for
permission
to
go
to
town
with
Maria;
and
as
Sir
Thomas
thought
it
best
for
each
daughter
that
the
permission
should
be
granted,
Lady
Bertram,
though
in
her
own
good
nature
she
would
not
have
prevented
it,
was
lamenting
the
change
it
made
in
the
prospect
of
Julia's
return,
which
would
otherwise
have
taken
place
about
this
time.
A
great
deal
of
good
sense
followed
on
Sir
Thomas's
side,
tending
to
reconcile
his
wife
to
the
arrangement.
Everything
that
a
considerate
parent
ought
to
feel
was
advanced
for
her
use;
and
everything
that
an
affectionate
mother
must
feel
in
promoting
her
children's
enjoyment
was
attributed
to
her
nature.
Lady
Bertram
agreed
to
it
all
with
a
calm
"Yes";
and
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour's
silent
consideration
spontaneously
observed,
"Sir
Thomas,
I
have
been
thinking
and
I
am
very
glad
we
took
Fanny
as
we
did,
for
now
the
others
are
away
we
feel
the
good
of
it."
Sir
Thomas
immediately
improved
this
compliment
by
adding,
"Very
true.
We
shew
Fanny
what
a
good
girl
we
think
her
by
praising
her
to
her
face,
she
is
now
a
very
valuable
companion.
If
we
have
been
kind
to
her,
she
is
now
quite
as
necessary
to
us."
"Yes,"
said
Lady
Bertram
presently;
"and
it
is
a
comfort
to
think
that
we
shall
always
have
her."
Sir
Thomas
paused,
half
smiled,
glanced
at
his
niece,
and
then
gravely
replied,
"She
will
never
leave
us,
I
hope,
till
invited
to
some
other
home
that
may
reasonably
promise
her
greater
happiness
than
she
knows
here."
"And
that
is
not
very
likely
to
be,
Sir
Thomas.
Who
should
invite
her?
Maria
might
be
very
glad
to
see
her
at
Sotherton
now
and
then,
but
she
would
not
think
of
asking
her
to
live
there;
and
I
am
sure
she
is
better
off
here;
and
besides,
I
cannot
do
without
her."
The
week
which
passed
so
quietly
and
peaceably
at
the
great
house
in
Mansfield
had
a
very
different
character
at
the
Parsonage.
To
the
young
lady,
at
least,
in
each
family,
it
brought
very
different
feelings.
What
was
tranquillity
and
comfort
to
Fanny
was
tediousness
and
vexation
to
Mary.
Something
arose
from
difference
of
disposition
and
habit:
one
so
easily
satisfied,
the
other
so
unused
to
endure;
but
still
more
might
be
imputed
to
difference
of
circumstances.
In
some
points
of
interest
they
were
exactly
opposed
to
each
other.
To
Fanny's
mind,
Edmund's
absence
was
really,
in
its
cause
and
its
tendency,
a
relief.
To
Mary
it
was
every
way
painful.
She
felt
the
want
of
his
society
every
day,
almost
every
hour,
and
was
too
much
in
want
of
it
to
derive
anything
but
irritation
from
considering
the
object
for
which
he
went.
He
could
not
have
devised
anything
more
likely
to
raise
his
consequence
than
this
week's
absence,
occurring
as
it
did
at
the
very
time
of
her
brother's
going
away,
of
William
Price's
going
too,
and
completing
the
sort
of
general
break
up
of
a
party
which
had
been
so
animated.
She
felt
it
keenly.
They
were
now
a
miserable
trio,
confined
within
doors
by
a
series
of
rain
and
snow,
with
nothing
to
do
and
no
variety
to
hope
for.
Angry
as
she
was
with
Edmund
for
adhering
to
his
own
notions,
and
acting
on
them
in
defiance
of
her
(and
she
had
been
so
angry
that
they
had
hardly
parted
friends
at
the
ball),
she
could
not
help
thinking
of
him
continually
when
absent,
dwelling
on
his
merit
and
affection,
and
longing
again
for
the
almost
daily
meetings
they
lately
had.
His
absence
was
unnecessarily
long.
He
should
not
have
planned
such
an
absence
he
should
not
have
left
home
for
a
week,
when
her
own
departure
from
Mansfield
was
so
near.
Then
she
began
to
blame
herself.
She
wished
she
had
not
spoken
so
warmly
in
their
last
conversation.
She
was
afraid
she
had
used
some
strong,
some
contemptuous
expressions
in
speaking
of
the
clergy,
and
that
should
not
have
been.
It
was
ill
bred;
it
was
wrong.
She
wished
such
words
unsaid
with
all
her
heart.
Her
vexation
did
not
end
with
the
week.
All
this
was
bad,
but
she
had
still
more
to
feel
when
Friday
came
round
again
and
brought
no
Edmund;
when
Saturday
came
and
still
no
Edmund;
and
when,
through
the
slight
communication
with
the
other
family
which
Sunday
produced,
she
learned
that
he
had
actually
written
home
to
defer
his
return,
having
promised
to
remain
some
days
longer
with
his
friend.
If
she
had
felt
impatience
and
regret
before
if
she
had
been
sorry
for
what
she
said,
and
feared
its
too
strong
effect
on
him
she
now
felt
and
feared
it
all
tenfold
more.
She
had,
moreover,
to
contend
with
one
disagreeable
emotion
entirely
new
to
her
jealousy.
His
friend
Mr.
Owen
had
sisters;
he
might
find
them
attractive.
But,
at
any
rate,
his
staying
away
at
a
time
when,
according
to
all
preceding
plans,
she
was
to
remove
to
London,
meant
something
that
she
could
not
bear.
Had
Henry
returned,
as
he
talked
of
doing,
at
the
end
of
three
or
four
days,
she
should
now
have
been
leaving
Mansfield.
It
became
absolutely
necessary
for
her
to
get
to
Fanny
and
try
to
learn
something
more.
She
could
not
live
any
longer
in
such
solitary
wretchedness;
and
she
made
her
way
to
the
Park,
through
difficulties
of
walking
which
she
had
deemed
unconquerable
a
week
before,
for
the
chance
of
hearing
a
little
in
addition,
for
the
sake
of
at
least
hearing
his
name.
The
first
half
hour
was
lost,
for
Fanny
and
Lady
Bertram
were
together,
and
unless
she
had
Fanny
to
herself
she
could
hope
for
nothing.
But
at
last
Lady
Bertram
left
the
room,
and
then
almost
immediately
Miss
Crawford
thus
began,
with
a
voice
as
well
regulated
as
she
could
"And
how
do
you
like
your
cousin
Edmund's
staying
away
so
long?
Being
the
only
young
person
at
home,
I
consider
you
as
the
greatest
sufferer.
You
must
miss
him.
Does
his
staying
longer
surprise
you?"
"I
do
not
know,"
said
Fanny
hesitatingly.
"Yes;
I
had
not
particularly
expected
it."
"Perhaps
he
will
always
stay
longer
than
he
talks
of.
It
is
the
general
way
all
young
men
do."
"He
did
not,
the
only
time
he
went
to
see
Mr.
Owen
before."
"He
finds
the
house
more
agreeable
now.
He
is
a
very
a
very
pleasing
young
man
himself,
and
I
cannot
help
being
rather
concerned
at
not
seeing
him
again
before
I
go
to
London,
as
will
now
undoubtedly
be
the
case.
I
am
looking
for
Henry
every
day,
and
as
soon
as
he
comes
there
will
be
nothing
to
detain
me
at
Mansfield.
I
should
like
to
have
seen
him
once
more,
I
confess.
But
you
must
give
my
compliments
to
him.
Yes;
I
think
it
must
be
compliments.
Is
not
there
a
something
wanted,
Miss
Price,
in
our
language
a
something
between
compliments
and
and
love
to
suit
the
sort
of
friendly
acquaintance
we
have
had
together?
So
many
months'
acquaintance!
But
compliments
may
be
sufficient
here.
Was
his
letter
a
long
one?
Does
he
give
you
much
account
of
what
he
is
doing?
Is
it
Christmas
gaieties
that
he
is
staying
for?"
"I
only
heard
a
part
of
the
letter;
it
was
to
my
uncle;
but
I
believe
it
was
very
short;
indeed
I
am
sure
it
was
but
a
few
lines.
All
that
I
heard
was
that
his
friend
had
pressed
him
to
stay
longer,
and
that
he
had
agreed
to
do
so.
A
few
days
longer,
or
some
days
longer;
I
am
not
quite
sure
which."
"Oh!
if
he
wrote
to
his
father;
but
I
thought
it
might
have
been
to
Lady
Bertram
or
you.
But
if
he
wrote
to
his
father,
no
wonder
he
was
concise.
Who
could
write
chat
to
Sir
Thomas?
If
he
had
written
to
you,
there
would
have
been
more
particulars.
You
would
have
heard
of
balls
and
parties.
He
would
have
sent
you
a
description
of
everything
and
everybody.
How
many
Miss
Owens
are
there?"
"Three
grown
up."
"Are
they
musical?"
"I
do
not
at
all
know.
I
never
heard."
"That
is
the
first
question,
you
know,"
said
Miss
Crawford,
trying
to
appear
gay
and
unconcerned,
"which
every
woman
who
plays
herself
is
sure
to
ask
about
another.
But
it
is
very
foolish
to
ask
questions
about
any
young
ladies
about
any
three
sisters
just
grown
up;
for
one
knows,
without
being
told,
exactly
what
they
are:
all
very
accomplished
and
pleasing,
and
one
very
pretty.
There
is
a
beauty
in
every
family;
it
is
a
regular
thing.
Two
play
on
the
pianoforte,
and
one
on
the
harp;
and
all
sing,
or
would
sing
if
they
were
taught,
or
sing
all
the
better
for
not
being
taught;
or
something
like
it."
"I
know
nothing
of
the
Miss
Owens,"
said
Fanny
calmly.
"You
know
nothing
and
you
care
less,
as
people
say.
Never
did
tone
express
indifference
plainer.
Indeed,
how
can
one
care
for
those
one
has
never
seen?
Well,
when
your
cousin
comes
back,
he
will
find
Mansfield
very
quiet;
all
the
noisy
ones
gone,
your
brother
and
mine
and
myself.
I
do
not
like
the
idea
of
leaving
Mrs.
Grant
now
the
time
draws
near.
She
does
not
like
my
going."
Fanny
felt
obliged
to
speak.
"You
cannot
doubt
your
being
missed
by
many,"
said
she.
"You
will
be
very
much
missed."
Miss
Crawford
turned
her
eye
on
her,
as
if
wanting
to
hear
or
see
more,
and
then
laughingly
said,
"Oh
yes!
missed
as
every
noisy
evil
is
missed
when
it
is
taken
away;
that
is,
there
is
a
great
difference
felt.
But
I
am
not
fishing;
don't
compliment
me.
If
I
am
missed,
it
will
appear.
I
may
be
discovered
by
those
who
want
to
see
me.
I
shall
not
be
in
any
doubtful,
or
distant,
or
unapproachable
region."
Now
Fanny
could
not
bring
herself
to
speak,
and
Miss
Crawford
was
disappointed;
for
she
had
hoped
to
hear
some
pleasant
assurance
of
her
power
from
one
who
she
thought
must
know,
and
her
spirits
were
clouded
again.
"The
Miss
Owens,"
said
she,
soon
afterwards;
"suppose
you
were
to
have
one
of
the
Miss
Owens
settled
at
Thornton
Lacey;
how
should
you
like
it?
Stranger
things
have
happened.
I
dare
say
they
are
trying
for
it.
And
they
are
quite
in
the
right,
for
it
would
be
a
very
pretty
establishment
for
them.
I
do
not
at
all
wonder
or
blame
them.
It
is
everybody's
duty
to
do
as
well
for
themselves
as
they
can.
Sir
Thomas
Bertram's
son
is
somebody;
and
now
he
is
in
their
own
line.
Their
father
is
a
clergyman,
and
their
brother
is
a
clergyman,
and
they
are
all
clergymen
together.
He
is
their
lawful
property;
he
fairly
belongs
to
them.
You
don't
speak,
Fanny;
Miss
Price,
you
don't
speak.
But
honestly
now,
do
not
you
rather
expect
it
than
otherwise?"
"No,"
said
Fanny
stoutly,
"I
do
not
expect
it
at
all."
"Not
at
all!"
cried
Miss
Crawford
with
alacrity.
"I
wonder
at
that.
But
I
dare
say
you
know
exactly
I
always
imagine
you
are
perhaps
you
do
not
think
him
likely
to
marry
at
all
or
not
at
present."
"No,
I
do
not,"
said
Fanny
softly,
hoping
she
did
not
err
either
in
the
belief
or
the
acknowledgment
of
it.
Her
companion
looked
at
her
keenly;
and
gathering
greater
spirit
from
the
blush
soon
produced
from
such
a
look,
only
said,
"He
is
best
off
as
he
is,"
and
turned
the
subject.
Miss
Crawford's
uneasiness
was
much
lightened
by
this
conversation,
and
she
walked
home
again
in
spirits
which
might
have
defied
almost
another
week
of
the
same
small
party
in
the
same
bad
weather,
had
they
been
put
to
the
proof;
but
as
that
very
evening
brought
her
brother
down
from
London
again
in
quite,
or
more
than
quite,
his
usual
cheerfulness,
she
had
nothing
farther
to
try
her
own.
His
still
refusing
to
tell
her
what
he
had
gone
for
was
but
the
promotion
of
gaiety;
a
day
before
it
might
have
irritated,
but
now
it
was
a
pleasant
joke
suspected
only
of
concealing
something
planned
as
a
pleasant
surprise
to
herself.
And
the
next
day
did
bring
a
surprise
to
her.
Henry
had
said
he
should
just
go
and
ask
the
Bertrams
how
they
did,
and
be
back
in
ten
minutes,
but
he
was
gone
above
an
hour;
and
when
his
sister,
who
had
been
waiting
for
him
to
walk
with
her
in
the
garden,
met
him
at
last
most
impatiently
in
the
sweep,
and
cried
out,
"My
dear
Henry,
where
can
you
have
been
all
this
time?"
he
had
only
to
say
that
he
had
been
sitting
with
Lady
Bertram
and
Fanny.
"Sitting
with
them
an
hour
and
a
half!"
exclaimed
Mary.
But
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
her
surprise.
"Yes,
Mary,"
said
he,
drawing
her
arm
within
his,
and
walking
along
the
sweep
as
if
not
knowing
where
he
was:
"I
could
not
get
away
sooner;
Fanny
looked
so
lovely!
I
am
quite
determined,
Mary.
My
mind
is
entirely
made
up.
Will
it
astonish
you?
No:
you
must
be
aware
that
I
am
quite
determined
to
marry
Fanny
Price."
The
surprise
was
now
complete;
for,
in
spite
of
whatever
his
consciousness
might
suggest,
a
suspicion
of
his
having
any
such
views
had
never
entered
his
sister's
imagination;
and
she
looked
so
truly
the
astonishment
she
felt,
that
he
was
obliged
to
repeat
what
he
had
said,
and
more
fully
and
more
solemnly.
The
conviction
of
his
determination
once
admitted,
it
was
not
unwelcome.
There
was
even
pleasure
with
the
surprise.
Mary
was
in
a
state
of
mind
to
rejoice
in
a
connexion
with
the
Bertram
family,
and
to
be
not
displeased
with
her
brother's
marrying
a
little
beneath
him.
"Yes,
Mary,"
was
Henry's
concluding
assurance.
"I
am
fairly
caught.
You
know
with
what
idle
designs
I
began;
but
this
is
the
end
of
them.
I
have,
I
flatter
myself,
made
no
inconsiderable
progress
in
her
affections;
but
my
own
are
entirely
fixed."
"Lucky,
lucky
girl!"
cried
Mary,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak;
"what
a
match
for
her!
My
dearest
Henry,
this
must
be
my
first
feeling;
but
my
second,
which
you
shall
have
as
sincerely,
is,
that
I
approve
your
choice
from
my
soul,
and
foresee
your
happiness
as
heartily
as
I
wish
and
desire
it.
You
will
have
a
sweet
little
wife;
all
gratitude
and
devotion.
Exactly
what
you
deserve.
What
an
amazing
match
for
her!
Mrs.
Norris
often
talks
of
her
luck;
what
will
she
say
now?
The
delight
of
all
the
family,
indeed!
And
she
has
some
true
friends
in
it!
How
they
will
rejoice!
But
tell
me
all
about
it!
Talk
to
me
for
ever.
When
did
you
begin
to
think
seriously
about
her?"
Nothing
could
be
more
impossible
than
to
answer
such
a
question,
though
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
than
to
have
it
asked.
"How
the
pleasing
plague
had
stolen
on
him"
he
could
not
say;
and
before
he
had
expressed
the
same
sentiment
with
a
little
variation
of
words
three
times
over,
his
sister
eagerly
interrupted
him
with,
"Ah,
my
dear
Henry,
and
this
is
what
took
you
to
London!
This
was
your
business!
You
chose
to
consult
the
Admiral
before
you
made
up
your
mind."
But
this
he
stoutly
denied.
He
knew
his
uncle
too
well
to
consult
him
on
any
matrimonial
scheme.
The
Admiral
hated
marriage,
and
thought
it
never
pardonable
in
a
young
man
of
independent
fortune.
"When
Fanny
is
known
to
him,"
continued
Henry,
"he
will
doat
on
her.
She
is
exactly
the
woman
to
do
away
every
prejudice
of
such
a
man
as
the
Admiral,
for
she
he
would
describe,
if
indeed
he
has
now
delicacy
of
language
enough
to
embody
his
own
ideas.
But
till
it
is
absolutely
settled
settled
beyond
all
interference,
he
shall
know
nothing
of
the
matter.
No,
Mary,
you
are
quite
mistaken.
You
have
not
discovered
my
business
yet."
"Well,
well,
I
am
satisfied.
I
know
now
to
whom
it
must
relate,
and
am
in
no
hurry
for
the
rest.
Fanny
Price!
wonderful,
quite
wonderful!
That
Mansfield
should
have
done
so
much
for
that
you
should
have
found
your
fate
in
Mansfield!
But
you
are
quite
right;
you
could
not
have
chosen
better.
There
is
not
a
better
girl
in
the
world,
and
you
do
not
want
for
fortune;
and
as
to
her
connexions,
they
are
more
than
good.
The
Bertrams
are
undoubtedly
some
of
the
first
people
in
this
country.
She
is
niece
to
Sir
Thomas
Bertram;
that
will
be
enough
for
the
world.
But
go
on,
go
on.
Tell
me
more.
What
are
your
plans?
Does
she
know
her
own
happiness?"
"No."
"What
are
you
waiting
for?"
"For
for
very
little
more
than
opportunity.
Mary,
she
is
not
like
her
cousins;
but
I
think
I
shall
not
ask
in
vain."
"Oh
no!
you
cannot.
Were
you
even
less
pleasing
supposing
her
not
to
love
you
already
(of
which,
however,
I
can
have
little
doubt)
you
would
be
safe.
The
gentleness
and
gratitude
of
her
disposition
would
secure
her
all
your
own
immediately.
From
my
soul
I
do
not
think
she
would
marry
you
without
love;
that
is,
if
there
is
a
girl
in
the
world
capable
of
being
uninfluenced
by
ambition,
I
can
suppose
it
her;
but
ask
her
to
love
you,
and
she
will
never
have
the
heart
to
refuse."
As
soon
as
her
eagerness
could
rest
in
silence,
he
was
as
happy
to
tell
as
she
could
be
to
listen;
and
a
conversation
followed
almost
as
deeply
interesting
to
her
as
to
himself,
though
he
had
in
fact
nothing
to
relate
but
his
own
sensations,
nothing
to
dwell
on
but
Fanny's
charms.
Fanny's
beauty
of
face
and
figure,
Fanny's
graces
of
manner
and
goodness
of
heart,
were
the
exhaustless
theme.
The
gentleness,
modesty,
and
sweetness
of
her
character
were
warmly
expatiated
on;
that
sweetness
which
makes
so
essential
a
part
of
every
woman's
worth
in
the
judgment
of
man,
that
though
he
sometimes
loves
where
it
is
not,
he
can
never
believe
it
absent.
Her
temper
he
had
good
reason
to
depend
on
and
to
praise.
He
had
often
seen
it
tried.
Was
there
one
of
the
family,
excepting
Edmund,
who
had
not
in
some
way
or
other
continually
exercised
her
patience
and
forbearance?
Her
affections
were
evidently
strong.
To
see
her
with
her
brother!
What
could
more
delightfully
prove
that
the
warmth
of
her
heart
was
equal
to
its
gentleness?
What
could
be
more
encouraging
to
a
man
who
had
her
love
in
view?
Then,
her
understanding
was
beyond
every
suspicion,
quick
and
clear;
and
her
manners
were
the
mirror
of
her
own
modest
and
elegant
mind.
Nor
was
this
all.
Henry
Crawford
had
too
much
sense
not
to
feel
the
worth
of
good
principles
in
a
wife,
though
he
was
too
little
accustomed
to
serious
reflection
to
know
them
by
their
proper
name;
but
when
he
talked
of
her
having
such
a
steadiness
and
regularity
of
conduct,
such
a
high
notion
of
honour,
and
such
an
observance
of
decorum
as
might
warrant
any
man
in
the
fullest
dependence
on
her
faith
and
integrity,
he
expressed
what
was
inspired
by
the
knowledge
of
her
being
well
principled
and
religious.
"I
could
so
wholly
and
absolutely
confide
in
her,"
said
he;
"and
that
is
what
I
want."
Well
might
his
sister,
believing
as
she
really
did
that
his
opinion
of
Fanny
Price
was
scarcely
beyond
her
merits,
rejoice
in
her
prospects.
"The
more
I
think
of
it,"
she
cried,
"the
more
am
I
convinced
that
you
are
doing
quite
right;
and
though
I
should
never
have
selected
Fanny
Price
as
the
girl
most
likely
to
attach
you,
I
am
now
persuaded
she
is
the
very
one
to
make
you
happy.
Your
wicked
project
upon
her
peace
turns
out
a
clever
thought
indeed.
You
will
both
find
your
good
in
it."
"It
was
bad,
very
bad
in
me
against
such
a
creature;
but
I
did
not
know
her
then;
and
she
shall
have
no
reason
to
lament
the
hour
that
first
put
it
into
my
head.
I
will
make
her
very
happy,
Mary;
happier
than
she
has
ever
yet
been
herself,
or
ever
seen
anybody
else.
I
will
not
take
her
from
Northamptonshire.
I
shall
let
Everingham,
and
rent
a
place
in
this
neighbourhood;
perhaps
Stanwix
Lodge.
I
shall
let
a
seven
years'
lease
of
Everingham.
I
am
sure
of
an
excellent
tenant
at
half
a
word.
I
could
name
three
people
now,
who
would
give
me
my
own
terms
and
thank
me."
"Ha!"
cried
Mary;
"settle
in
Northamptonshire!
That
is
pleasant!
Then
we
shall
be
all
together."
When
she
had
spoken
it,
she
recollected
herself,
and
wished
it
unsaid;
but
there
was
no
need
of
confusion;
for
her
brother
saw
her
only
as
the
supposed
inmate
of
Mansfield
parsonage,
and
replied
but
to
invite
her
in
the
kindest
manner
to
his
own
house,
and
to
claim
the
best
right
in
her.
"You
must
give
us
more
than
half
your
time,"
said
he.
"I
cannot
admit
Mrs.
Grant
to
have
an
equal
claim
with
Fanny
and
myself,
for
we
shall
both
have
a
right
in
you.
Fanny
will
be
so
truly
your
sister!"
Mary
had
only
to
be
grateful
and
give
general
assurances;
but
she
was
now
very
fully
purposed
to
be
the
guest
of
neither
brother
nor
sister
many
months
longer.
"You
will
divide
your
year
between
London
and
Northamptonshire?"
"Yes."
"That's
right;
and
in
London,
of
course,
a
house
of
your
own:
no
longer
with
the
Admiral.
My
dearest
Henry,
the
advantage
to
you
of
getting
away
from
the
Admiral
before
your
manners
are
hurt
by
the
contagion
of
his,
before
you
have
contracted
any
of
his
foolish
opinions,
or
learned
to
sit
over
your
dinner
as
if
it
were
the
best
blessing
of
life!
You
are
not
sensible
of
the
gain,
for
your
regard
for
him
has
blinded
you;
but,
in
my
estimation,
your
marrying
early
may
be
the
saving
of
you.
To
have
seen
you
grow
like
the
Admiral
in
word
or
deed,
look
or
gesture,
would
have
broken
my
heart."
"Well,
well,
we
do
not
think
quite
alike
here.
The
Admiral
has
his
faults,
but
he
is
a
very
good
man,
and
has
been
more
than
a
father
to
me.
Few
fathers
would
have
let
me
have
my
own
way
half
so
much.
You
must
not
prejudice
Fanny
against
him.
I
must
have
them
love
one
another."
Mary
refrained
from
saying
what
she
felt,
that
there
could
not
be
two
persons
in
existence
whose
characters
and
manners
were
less
accordant:
time
would
discover
it
to
him;
but
she
could
not
help
this
reflection
on
the
Admiral.
"Henry,
I
think
so
highly
of
Fanny
Price,
that
if
I
could
suppose
the
next
Mrs.
Crawford
would
have
half
the
reason
which
my
poor
ill
used
aunt
had
to
abhor
the
very
name,
I
would
prevent
the
marriage,
if
possible;
but
I
know
you:
I
know
that
a
wife
you
loved
would
be
the
happiest
of
women,
and
that
even
when
you
ceased
to
love,
she
would
yet
find
in
you
the
liberality
and
good
breeding
of
a
gentleman."
The
impossibility
of
not
doing
everything
in
the
world
to
make
Fanny
Price
happy,
or
of
ceasing
to
love
Fanny
Price,
was
of
course
the
groundwork
of
his
eloquent
answer.
"Had
you
seen
her
this
morning,
Mary,"
he
continued,
"attending
with
such
ineffable
sweetness
and
patience
to
all
the
demands
of
her
aunt's
stupidity,
working
with
her,
and
for
her,
her
colour
beautifully
heightened
as
she
leant
over
the
work,
then
returning
to
her
seat
to
finish
a
note
which
she
was
previously
engaged
in
writing
for
that
stupid
woman's
service,
and
all
this
with
such
unpretending
gentleness,
so
much
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
course
that
she
was
not
to
have
a
moment
at
her
own
command,
her
hair
arranged
as
neatly
as
it
always
is,
and
one
little
curl
falling
forward
as
she
wrote,
which
she
now
and
then
shook
back,
and
in
the
midst
of
all
this,
still
speaking
at
intervals
to
me,
or
listening,
and
as
if
she
liked
to
listen,
to
what
I
said.
Had
you
seen
her
so,
Mary,
you
would
not
have
implied
the
possibility
of
her
power
over
my
heart
ever
ceasing."
"My
dearest
Henry,"
cried
Mary,
stopping
short,
and
smiling
in
his
face,
"how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
so
much
in
love!
It
quite
delights
me.
But
what
will
Mrs.
Rushworth
and
Julia
say?"
"I
care
neither
what
they
say
nor
what
they
feel.
They
will
now
see
what
sort
of
woman
it
is
that
can
attach
me,
that
can
attach
a
man
of
sense.
I
wish
the
discovery
may
do
them
any
good.
And
they
will
now
see
their
cousin
treated
as
she
ought
to
be,
and
I
wish
they
may
be
heartily
ashamed
of
their
own
abominable
neglect
and
unkindness.
They
will
be
angry,"
he
added,
after
a
moment's
silence,
and
in
a
cooler
tone;
"Mrs.
Rushworth
will
be
very
angry.
It
will
be
a
bitter
pill
to
her;
that
is,
like
other
bitter
pills,
it
will
have
two
moments'
ill
flavour,
and
then
be
swallowed
and
forgotten;
for
I
am
not
such
a
coxcomb
as
to
suppose
her
feelings
more
lasting
than
other
women's,
though
I
was
the
object
of
them.
Yes,
Mary,
my
Fanny
will
feel
a
difference
indeed:
a
daily,
hourly
difference,
in
the
behaviour
of
every
being
who
approaches
her;
and
it
will
be
the
completion
of
my
happiness
to
know
that
I
am
the
doer
of
it,
that
I
am
the
person
to
give
the
consequence
so
justly
her
due.
Now
she
is
dependent,
helpless,
friendless,
neglected,
forgotten."
"Nay,
Henry,
not
by
all;
not
forgotten
by
all;
not
friendless
or
forgotten.
Her
cousin
Edmund
never
forgets
her."
"Edmund!
True,
I
believe
he
is,
generally
speaking,
kind
to
her,
and
so
is
Sir
Thomas
in
his
way;
but
it
is
the
way
of
a
rich,
superior,
long
worded,
arbitrary
uncle.
What
can
Sir
Thomas
and
Edmund
together
do,
what
do
they
do
for
her
happiness,
comfort,
honour,
and
dignity
in
the
world,
to
what
I
shall
do?"
Henry
Crawford
was
at
Mansfield
Park
again
the
next
morning,
and
at
an
earlier
hour
than
common
visiting
warrants.
The
two
ladies
were
together
in
the
breakfast
room,
and,
fortunately
for
him,
Lady
Bertram
was
on
the
very
point
of
quitting
it
as
he
entered.
She
was
almost
at
the
door,
and
not
chusing
by
any
means
to
take
so
much
trouble
in
vain,
she
still
went
on,
after
a
civil
reception,
a
short
sentence
about
being
waited
for,
and
a
"Let
Sir
Thomas
know"
to
the
servant.
Henry,
overjoyed
to
have
her
go,
bowed
and
watched
her
off,
and
without
losing
another
moment,
turned
instantly
to
Fanny,
and,
taking
out
some
letters,
said,
with
a
most
animated
look,
"I
must
acknowledge
myself
infinitely
obliged
to
any
creature
who
gives
me
such
an
opportunity
of
seeing
you
alone:
I
have
been
wishing
it
more
than
you
can
have
any
idea.
Knowing
as
I
do
what
your
feelings
as
a
sister
are,
I
could
hardly
have
borne
that
any
one
in
the
house
should
share
with
you
in
the
first
knowledge
of
the
news
I
now
bring.
He
is
made.
Your
brother
is
a
lieutenant.
I
have
the
infinite
satisfaction
of
congratulating
you
on
your
brother's
promotion.
Here
are
the
letters
which
announce
it,
this
moment
come
to
hand.
You
will,
perhaps,
like
to
see
them."
Fanny
could
not
speak,
but
he
did
not
want
her
to
speak.
To
see
the
expression
of
her
eyes,
the
change
of
her
complexion,
the
progress
of
her
feelings,
their
doubt,
confusion,
and
felicity,
was
enough.
She
took
the
letters
as
he
gave
them.
The
first
was
from
the
Admiral
to
inform
his
nephew,
in
a
few
words,
of
his
having
succeeded
in
the
object
he
had
undertaken,
the
promotion
of
young
Price,
and
enclosing
two
more,
one
from
the
Secretary
of
the
First
Lord
to
a
friend,
whom
the
Admiral
had
set
to
work
in
the
business,
the
other
from
that
friend
to
himself,
by
which
it
appeared
that
his
lordship
had
the
very
great
happiness
of
attending
to
the
recommendation
of
Sir
Charles;
that
Sir
Charles
was
much
delighted
in
having
such
an
opportunity
of
proving
his
regard
for
Admiral
Crawford,
and
that
the
circumstance
of
Mr.
William
Price's
commission
as
Second
Lieutenant
of
H.M.
Sloop
Thrush
being
made
out
was
spreading
general
joy
through
a
wide
circle
of
great
people.
While
her
hand
was
trembling
under
these
letters,
her
eye
running
from
one
to
the
other,
and
her
heart
swelling
with
emotion,
Crawford
thus
continued,
with
unfeigned
eagerness,
to
express
his
interest
in
the
event
"I
will
not
talk
of
my
own
happiness,"
said
he,
"great
as
it
is,
for
I
think
only
of
yours.
Compared
with
you,
who
has
a
right
to
be
happy?
I
have
almost
grudged
myself
my
own
prior
knowledge
of
what
you
ought
to
have
known
before
all
the
world.
I
have
not
lost
a
moment,
however.
The
post
was
late
this
morning,
but
there
has
not
been
since
a
moment's
delay.
How
impatient,
how
anxious,
how
wild
I
have
been
on
the
subject,
I
will
not
attempt
to
describe;
how
severely
mortified,
how
cruelly
disappointed,
in
not
having
it
finished
while
I
was
in
London!
I
was
kept
there
from
day
to
day
in
the
hope
of
it,
for
nothing
less
dear
to
me
than
such
an
object
would
have
detained
me
half
the
time
from
Mansfield.
But
though
my
uncle
entered
into
my
wishes
with
all
the
warmth
I
could
desire,
and
exerted
himself
immediately,
there
were
difficulties
from
the
absence
of
one
friend,
and
the
engagements
of
another,
which
at
last
I
could
no
longer
bear
to
stay
the
end
of,
and
knowing
in
what
good
hands
I
left
the
cause,
I
came
away
on
Monday,
trusting
that
many
posts
would
not
pass
before
I
should
be
followed
by
such
very
letters
as
these.
My
uncle,
who
is
the
very
best
man
in
the
world,
has
exerted
himself,
as
I
knew
he
would,
after
seeing
your
brother.
He
was
delighted
with
him.
I
would
not
allow
myself
yesterday
to
say
how
delighted,
or
to
repeat
half
that
the
Admiral
said
in
his
praise.
I
deferred
it
all
till
his
praise
should
be
proved
the
praise
of
a
friend,
as
this
day
does
prove
it.
Now
I
may
say
that
even
I
could
not
require
William
Price
to
excite
a
greater
interest,
or
be
followed
by
warmer
wishes
and
higher
commendation,
than
were
most
voluntarily
bestowed
by
my
uncle
after
the
evening
they
had
passed
together."
"Has
this
been
all
your
doing,
then?"
cried
Fanny.
"Good
heaven!
how
very,
very
kind!
Have
you
really
was
it
by
your
desire?
I
beg
your
pardon,
but
I
am
bewildered.
Did
Admiral
Crawford
apply?
How
was
it?
I
am
stupefied."
Henry
was
most
happy
to
make
it
more
intelligible,
by
beginning
at
an
earlier
stage,
and
explaining
very
particularly
what
he
had
done.
His
last
journey
to
London
had
been
undertaken
with
no
other
view
than
that
of
introducing
her
brother
in
Hill
Street,
and
prevailing
on
the
Admiral
to
exert
whatever
interest
he
might
have
for
getting
him
on.
This
had
been
his
business.
He
had
communicated
it
to
no
creature:
he
had
not
breathed
a
syllable
of
it
even
to
Mary;
while
uncertain
of
the
issue,
he
could
not
have
borne
any
participation
of
his
feelings,
but
this
had
been
his
business;
and
he
spoke
with
such
a
glow
of
what
his
solicitude
had
been,
and
used
such
strong
expressions,
was
so
abounding
in
the
deepest
interest,
in
twofold
motives,
in
views
and
wishes
more
than
could
be
told,
that
Fanny
could
not
have
remained
insensible
of
his
drift,
had
she
been
able
to
attend;
but
her
heart
was
so
full
and
her
senses
still
so
astonished,
that
she
could
listen
but
imperfectly
even
to
what
he
told
her
of
William,
and
saying
only
when
he
paused,
"How
kind!
how
very
kind!
Oh,
Mr.
Crawford,
we
are
infinitely
obliged
to
you!
Dearest,
dearest
William!"
She
jumped
up
and
moved
in
haste
towards
the
door,
crying
out,
"I
will
go
to
my
uncle.
My
uncle
ought
to
know
it
as
soon
as
possible."
But
this
could
not
be
suffered.
The
opportunity
was
too
fair,
and
his
feelings
too
impatient.
He
was
after
her
immediately.
"She
must
not
go,
she
must
allow
him
five
minutes
longer,"
and
he
took
her
hand
and
led
her
back
to
her
seat,
and
was
in
the
middle
of
his
farther
explanation,
before
she
had
suspected
for
what
she
was
detained.
When
she
did
understand
it,
however,
and
found
herself
expected
to
believe
that
she
had
created
sensations
which
his
heart
had
never
known
before,
and
that
everything
he
had
done
for
William
was
to
be
placed
to
the
account
of
his
excessive
and
unequalled
attachment
to
her,
she
was
exceedingly
distressed,
and
for
some
moments
unable
to
speak.
She
considered
it
all
as
nonsense,
as
mere
trifling
and
gallantry,
which
meant
only
to
deceive
for
the
hour;
she
could
not
but
feel
that
it
was
treating
her
improperly
and
unworthily,
and
in
such
a
way
as
she
had
not
deserved;
but
it
was
like
himself,
and
entirely
of
a
piece
with
what
she
had
seen
before;
and
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
shew
half
the
displeasure
she
felt,
because
he
had
been
conferring
an
obligation,
which
no
want
of
delicacy
on
his
part
could
make
a
trifle
to
her.
While
her
heart
was
still
bounding
with
joy
and
gratitude
on
William's
behalf,
she
could
not
be
severely
resentful
of
anything
that
injured
only
herself;
and
after
having
twice
drawn
back
her
hand,
and
twice
attempted
in
vain
to
turn
away
from
him,
she
got
up,
and
said
only,
with
much
agitation,
"Don't,
Mr.
Crawford,
pray
don't!
I
beg
you
would
not.
This
is
a
sort
of
talking
which
is
very
unpleasant
to
me.
I
must
go
away.
I
cannot
bear
it."
But
he
was
still
talking
on,
describing
his
affection,
soliciting
a
return,
and,
finally,
in
words
so
plain
as
to
bear
but
one
meaning
even
to
her,
offering
himself,
hand,
fortune,
everything,
to
her
acceptance.
It
was
so;
he
had
said
it.
Her
astonishment
and
confusion
increased;
and
though
still
not
knowing
how
to
suppose
him
serious,
she
could
hardly
stand.
He
pressed
for
an
answer.
"No,
no,
no!"
she
cried,
hiding
her
face.
"This
is
all
nonsense.
Do
not
distress
me.
I
can
hear
no
more
of
this.
Your
kindness
to
William
makes
me
more
obliged
to
you
than
words
can
express;
but
I
do
not
want,
I
cannot
bear,
I
must
not
listen
to
such
No,
no,
don't
think
of
me.
But
you
are
not
thinking
of
me.
I
know
it
is
all
nothing."
She
had
burst
away
from
him,
and
at
that
moment
Sir
Thomas
was
heard
speaking
to
a
servant
in
his
way
towards
the
room
they
were
in.
It
was
no
time
for
farther
assurances
or
entreaty,
though
to
part
with
her
at
a
moment
when
her
modesty
alone
seemed,
to
his
sanguine
and
preassured
mind,
to
stand
in
the
way
of
the
happiness
he
sought,
was
a
cruel
necessity.
She
rushed
out
at
an
opposite
door
from
the
one
her
uncle
was
approaching,
and
was
walking
up
and
down
the
East
room
in
the
utmost
confusion
of
contrary
feeling,
before
Sir
Thomas's
politeness
or
apologies
were
over,
or
he
had
reached
the
beginning
of
the
joyful
intelligence
which
his
visitor
came
to
communicate.
She
was
feeling,
thinking,
trembling
about
everything;
agitated,
happy,
miserable,
infinitely
obliged,
absolutely
angry.
It
was
all
beyond
belief!
He
was
inexcusable,
incomprehensible!
But
such
were
his
habits
that
he
could
do
nothing
without
a
mixture
of
evil.
He
had
previously
made
her
the
happiest
of
human
beings,
and
now
he
had
insulted
she
knew
not
what
to
say,
how
to
class,
or
how
to
regard
it.
She
would
not
have
him
be
serious,
and
yet
what
could
excuse
the
use
of
such
words
and
offers,
if
they
meant
but
to
trifle?
But
William
was
a
lieutenant.
That
was
a
fact
beyond
a
doubt,
and
without
an
alloy.
She
would
think
of
it
for
ever
and
forget
all
the
rest.
Mr.
Crawford
would
certainly
never
address
her
so
again:
he
must
have
seen
how
unwelcome
it
was
to
her;
and
in
that
case,
how
gratefully
she
could
esteem
him
for
his
friendship
to
William!
She
would
not
stir
farther
from
the
East
room
than
the
head
of
the
great
staircase,
till
she
had
satisfied
herself
of
Mr.
Crawford's
having
left
the
house;
but
when
convinced
of
his
being
gone,
she
was
eager
to
go
down
and
be
with
her
uncle,
and
have
all
the
happiness
of
his
joy
as
well
as
her
own,
and
all
the
benefit
of
his
information
or
his
conjectures
as
to
what
would
now
be
William's
destination.
Sir
Thomas
was
as
joyful
as
she
could
desire,
and
very
kind
and
communicative;
and
she
had
so
comfortable
a
talk
with
him
about
William
as
to
make
her
feel
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
to
vex
her,
till
she
found,
towards
the
close,
that
Mr.
Crawford
was
engaged
to
return
and
dine
there
that
very
day.
This
was
a
most
unwelcome
hearing,
for
though
he
might
think
nothing
of
what
had
passed,
it
would
be
quite
distressing
to
her
to
see
him
again
so
soon.
She
tried
to
get
the
better
of
it;
tried
very
hard,
as
the
dinner
hour
approached,
to
feel
and
appear
as
usual;
but
it
was
quite
impossible
for
her
not
to
look
most
shy
and
uncomfortable
when
their
visitor
entered
the
room.
She
could
not
have
supposed
it
in
the
power
of
any
concurrence
of
circumstances
to
give
her
so
many
painful
sensations
on
the
first
day
of
hearing
of
William's
promotion.
Mr.
Crawford
was
not
only
in
the
room
he
was
soon
close
to
her.
He
had
a
note
to
deliver
from
his
sister.
Fanny
could
not
look
at
him,
but
there
was
no
consciousness
of
past
folly
in
his
voice.
She
opened
her
note
immediately,
glad
to
have
anything
to
do,
and
happy,
as
she
read
it,
to
feel
that
the
fidgetings
of
her
aunt
Norris,
who
was
also
to
dine
there,
screened
her
a
little
from
view.
"My
dear
Fanny,
for
so
I
may
now
always
call
you,
to
the
infinite
relief
of
a
tongue
that
has
been
stumbling
at
Miss
Price
for
at
least
the
last
six
weeks
I
cannot
let
my
brother
go
without
sending
you
a
few
lines
of
general
congratulation,
and
giving
my
most
joyful
consent
and
approval.
Go
on,
my
dear
Fanny,
and
without
fear;
there
can
be
no
difficulties
worth
naming.
I
chuse
to
suppose
that
the
assurance
of
my
consent
will
be
something;
so
you
may
smile
upon
him
with
your
sweetest
smiles
this
afternoon,
and
send
him
back
to
me
even
happier
than
he
goes.
Yours
affectionately,
M.
C."
These
were
not
expressions
to
do
Fanny
any
good;
for
though
she
read
in
too
much
haste
and
confusion
to
form
the
clearest
judgment
of
Miss
Crawford's
meaning,
it
was
evident
that
she
meant
to
compliment
her
on
her
brother's
attachment,
and
even
to
appear
to
believe
it
serious.
She
did
not
know
what
to
do,
or
what
to
think.
There
was
wretchedness
in
the
idea
of
its
being
serious;
there
was
perplexity
and
agitation
every
way.
She
was
distressed
whenever
Mr.
Crawford
spoke
to
her,
and
he
spoke
to
her
much
too
often;
and
she
was
afraid
there
was
a
something
in
his
voice
and
manner
in
addressing
her
very
different
from
what
they
were
when
he
talked
to
the
others.
Her
comfort
in
that
day's
dinner
was
quite
destroyed:
she
could
hardly
eat
anything;
and
when
Sir
Thomas
good
humouredly
observed
that
joy
had
taken
away
her
appetite,
she
was
ready
to
sink
with
shame,
from
the
dread
of
Mr.
Crawford's
interpretation;
for
though
nothing
could
have
tempted
her
to
turn
her
eyes
to
the
right
hand,
where
he
sat,
she
felt
that
his
were
immediately
directed
towards
her.
She
was
more
silent
than
ever.
She
would
hardly
join
even
when
William
was
the
subject,
for
his
commission
came
all
from
the
right
hand
too,
and
there
was
pain
in
the
connexion.
She
thought
Lady
Bertram
sat
longer
than
ever,
and
began
to
be
in
despair
of
ever
getting
away;
but
at
last
they
were
in
the
drawing
room,
and
she
was
able
to
think
as
she
would,
while
her
aunts
finished
the
subject
of
William's
appointment
in
their
own
style.
Mrs.
Norris
seemed
as
much
delighted
with
the
saving
it
would
be
to
Sir
Thomas
as
with
any
part
of
it.
"Now
William
would
be
able
to
keep
himself,
which
would
make
a
vast
difference
to
his
uncle,
for
it
was
unknown
how
much
he
had
cost
his
uncle;
and,
indeed,
it
would
make
some
difference
in
her
presents
too.
She
was
very
glad
that
she
had
given
William
what
she
did
at
parting,
very
glad,
indeed,
that
it
had
been
in
her
power,
without
material
inconvenience,
just
at
that
time
to
give
him
something
rather
considerable;
that
is,
for
her,
with
her
limited
means,
for
now
it
would
all
be
useful
in
helping
to
fit
up
his
cabin.
She
knew
he
must
be
at
some
expense,
that
he
would
have
many
things
to
buy,
though
to
be
sure
his
father
and
mother
would
be
able
to
put
him
in
the
way
of
getting
everything
very
cheap;
but
she
was
very
glad
she
had
contributed
her
mite
towards
it."
"I
am
glad
you
gave
him
something
considerable,"
said
Lady
Bertram,
with
most
unsuspicious
calmness,
"for
I
gave
him
only
10
pounds."
"Indeed!"
cried
Mrs.
Norris,
reddening.
"Upon
my
word,
he
must
have
gone
off
with
his
pockets
well
lined,
and
at
no
expense
for
his
journey
to
London
either!"
"Sir
Thomas
told
me
10
pounds
would
be
enough."
Mrs.
Norris,
being
not
at
all
inclined
to
question
its
sufficiency,
began
to
take
the
matter
in
another
point.
"It
is
amazing,"
said
she,
"how
much
young
people
cost
their
friends,
what
with
bringing
them
up
and
putting
them
out
in
the
world!
They
little
think
how
much
it
comes
to,
or
what
their
parents,
or
their
uncles
and
aunts,
pay
for
them
in
the
course
of
the
year.
Now,
here
are
my
sister
Price's
children;
take
them
all
together,
I
dare
say
nobody
would
believe
what
a
sum
they
cost
Sir
Thomas
every
year,
to
say
nothing
of
what
I
do
for
them."
"Very
true,
sister,
as
you
say.
But,
poor
things!
they
cannot
help
it;
and
you
know
it
makes
very
little
difference
to
Sir
Thomas.
Fanny,
William
must
not
forget
my
shawl
if
he
goes
to
the
East
Indies;
and
I
shall
give
him
a
commission
for
anything
else
that
is
worth
having.
I
wish
he
may
go
to
the
East
Indies,
that
I
may
have
my
shawl.
I
think
I
will
have
two
shawls,
Fanny."
Fanny,
meanwhile,
speaking
only
when
she
could
not
help
it,
was
very
earnestly
trying
to
understand
what
Mr.
and
Miss
Crawford
were
at.
There
was
everything
in
the
world
against
their
being
serious
but
his
words
and
manner.
Everything
natural,
probable,
reasonable,
was
against
it;
all
their
habits
and
ways
of
thinking,
and
all
her
own
demerits.
How
could
she
have
excited
serious
attachment
in
a
man
who
had
seen
so
many,
and
been
admired
by
so
many,
and
flirted
with
so
many,
infinitely
her
superiors;
who
seemed
so
little
open
to
serious
impressions,
even
where
pains
had
been
taken
to
please
him;
who
thought
so
slightly,
so
carelessly,
so
unfeelingly
on
all
such
points;
who
was
everything
to
everybody,
and
seemed
to
find
no
one
essential
to
him?
And
farther,
how
could
it
be
supposed
that
his
sister,
with
all
her
high
and
worldly
notions
of
matrimony,
would
be
forwarding
anything
of
a
serious
nature
in
such
a
quarter?
Nothing
could
be
more
unnatural
in
either.
Fanny
was
ashamed
of
her
own
doubts.
Everything
might
be
possible
rather
than
serious
attachment,
or
serious
approbation
of
it
toward
her.
She
had
quite
convinced
herself
of
this
before
Sir
Thomas
and
Mr.
Crawford
joined
them.
The
difficulty
was
in
maintaining
the
conviction
quite
so
absolutely
after
Mr.
Crawford
was
in
the
room;
for
once
or
twice
a
look
seemed
forced
on
her
which
she
did
not
know
how
to
class
among
the
common
meaning;
in
any
other
man,
at
least,
she
would
have
said
that
it
meant
something
very
earnest,
very
pointed.
But
she
still
tried
to
believe
it
no
more
than
what
he
might
often
have
expressed
towards
her
cousins
and
fifty
other
women.
She
thought
he
was
wishing
to
speak
to
her
unheard
by
the
rest.
She
fancied
he
was
trying
for
it
the
whole
evening
at
intervals,
whenever
Sir
Thomas
was
out
of
the
room,
or
at
all
engaged
with
Mrs.
Norris,
and
she
carefully
refused
him
every
opportunity.
At
last
it
seemed
an
at
last
to
Fanny's
nervousness,
though
not
remarkably
late
he
began
to
talk
of
going
away;
but
the
comfort
of
the
sound
was
impaired
by
his
turning
to
her
the
next
moment,
and
saying,
"Have
you
nothing
to
send
to
Mary?
No
answer
to
her
note?
She
will
be
disappointed
if
she
receives
nothing
from
you.
Pray
write
to
her,
if
it
be
only
a
line."
"Oh
yes!
certainly,"
cried
Fanny,
rising
in
haste,
the
haste
of
embarrassment
and
of
wanting
to
get
away
"I
will
write
directly."
She
went
accordingly
to
the
table,
where
she
was
in
the
habit
of
writing
for
her
aunt,
and
prepared
her
materials
without
knowing
what
in
the
world
to
say.
She
had
read
Miss
Crawford's
note
only
once,
and
how
to
reply
to
anything
so
imperfectly
understood
was
most
distressing.
Quite
unpractised
in
such
sort
of
note
writing,
had
there
been
time
for
scruples
and
fears
as
to
style
she
would
have
felt
them
in
abundance:
but
something
must
be
instantly
written;
and
with
only
one
decided
feeling,
that
of
wishing
not
to
appear
to
think
anything
really
intended,
she
wrote
thus,
in
great
trembling
both
of
spirits
and
hand
"I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you,
my
dear
Miss
Crawford,
for
your
kind
congratulations,
as
far
as
they
relate
to
my
dearest
William.
The
rest
of
your
note
I
know
means
nothing;
but
I
am
so
unequal
to
anything
of
the
sort,
that
I
hope
you
will
excuse
my
begging
you
to
take
no
farther
notice.
I
have
seen
too
much
of
Mr.
Crawford
not
to
understand
his
manners;
if
he
understood
me
as
well,
he
would,
I
dare
say,
behave
differently.
I
do
not
know
what
I
write,
but
it
would
be
a
great
favour
of
you
never
to
mention
the
subject
again.
With
thanks
for
the
honour
of
your
note,
I
remain,
dear
Miss
Crawford,
etc.,
etc."
The
conclusion
was
scarcely
intelligible
from
increasing
fright,
for
she
found
that
Mr.
Crawford,
under
pretence
of
receiving
the
note,
was
coming
towards
her.
"You
cannot
think
I
mean
to
hurry
you,"
said
he,
in
an
undervoice,
perceiving
the
amazing
trepidation
with
which
she
made
up
the
note,
"you
cannot
think
I
have
any
such
object.
Do
not
hurry
yourself,
I
entreat."
"Oh!
I
thank
you;
I
have
quite
done,
just
done;
it
will
be
ready
in
a
moment;
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you;
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
give
that
to
Miss
Crawford."
The
note
was
held
out,
and
must
be
taken;
and
as
she
instantly
and
with
averted
eyes
walked
towards
the
fireplace,
where
sat
the
others,
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
in
good
earnest.
Fanny
thought
she
had
never
known
a
day
of
greater
agitation,
both
of
pain
and
pleasure;
but
happily
the
pleasure
was
not
of
a
sort
to
die
with
the
day;
for
every
day
would
restore
the
knowledge
of
William's
advancement,
whereas
the
pain,
she
hoped,
would
return
no
more.
She
had
no
doubt
that
her
note
must
appear
excessively
ill
written,
that
the
language
would
disgrace
a
child,
for
her
distress
had
allowed
no
arrangement;
but
at
least
it
would
assure
them
both
of
her
being
neither
imposed
on
nor
gratified
by
Mr.
Crawford's
attentions.
Fanny
had
by
no
means
forgotten
Mr.
Crawford
when
she
awoke
the
next
morning;
but
she
remembered
the
purport
of
her
note,
and
was
not
less
sanguine
as
to
its
effect
than
she
had
been
the
night
before.
If
Mr.
Crawford
would
but
go
away!
That
was
what
she
most
earnestly
desired:
go
and
take
his
sister
with
him,
as
he
was
to
do,
and
as
he
returned
to
Mansfield
on
purpose
to
do.
And
why
it
was
not
done
already
she
could
not
devise,
for
Miss
Crawford
certainly
wanted
no
delay.
Fanny
had
hoped,
in
the
course
of
his
yesterday's
visit,
to
hear
the
day
named;
but
he
had
only
spoken
of
their
journey
as
what
would
take
place
ere
long.
Having
so
satisfactorily
settled
the
conviction
her
note
would
convey,
she
could
not
but
be
astonished
to
see
Mr.
Crawford,
as
she
accidentally
did,
coming
up
to
the
house
again,
and
at
an
hour
as
early
as
the
day
before.
His
coming
might
have
nothing
to
do
with
her,
but
she
must
avoid
seeing
him
if
possible;
and
being
then
on
her
way
upstairs,
she
resolved
there
to
remain,
during
the
whole
of
his
visit,
unless
actually
sent
for;
and
as
Mrs.
Norris
was
still
in
the
house,
there
seemed
little
danger
of
her
being
wanted.
She
sat
some
time
in
a
good
deal
of
agitation,
listening,
trembling,
and
fearing
to
be
sent
for
every
moment;
but
as
no
footsteps
approached
the
East
room,
she
grew
gradually
composed,
could
sit
down,
and
be
able
to
employ
herself,
and
able
to
hope
that
Mr.
Crawford
had
come
and
would
go
without
her
being
obliged
to
know
anything
of
the
matter.
Nearly
half
an
hour
had
passed,
and
she
was
growing
very
comfortable,
when
suddenly
the
sound
of
a
step
in
regular
approach
was
heard;
a
heavy
step,
an
unusual
step
in
that
part
of
the
house:
it
was
her
uncle's;
she
knew
it
as
well
as
his
voice;
she
had
trembled
at
it
as
often,
and
began
to
tremble
again,
at
the
idea
of
his
coming
up
to
speak
to
her,
whatever
might
be
the
subject.
It
was
indeed
Sir
Thomas
who
opened
the
door
and
asked
if
she
were
there,
and
if
he
might
come
in.
The
terror
of
his
former
occasional
visits
to
that
room
seemed
all
renewed,
and
she
felt
as
if
he
were
going
to
examine
her
again
in
French
and
English.
She
was
all
attention,
however,
in
placing
a
chair
for
him,
and
trying
to
appear
honoured;
and,
in
her
agitation,
had
quite
overlooked
the
deficiencies
of
her
apartment,
till
he,
stopping
short
as
he
entered,
said,
with
much
surprise,
"Why
have
you
no
fire
to
day?"
There
was
snow
on
the
ground,
and
she
was
sitting
in
a
shawl.
She
hesitated.
"I
am
not
cold,
sir:
I
never
sit
here
long
at
this
time
of
year."
"But
you
have
a
fire
in
general?"
"No,
sir."
"How
comes
this
about?
Here
must
be
some
mistake.
I
understood
that
you
had
the
use
of
this
room
by
way
of
making
you
perfectly
comfortable.
In
your
bedchamber
I
know
you
cannot
have
a
fire.
Here
is
some
great
misapprehension
which
must
be
rectified.
It
is
highly
unfit
for
you
to
sit,
be
it
only
half
an
hour
a
day,
without
a
fire.
You
are
not
strong.
You
are
chilly.
Your
aunt
cannot
be
aware
of
this."
Fanny
would
rather
have
been
silent;
but
being
obliged
to
speak,
she
could
not
forbear,
in
justice
to
the
aunt
she
loved
best,
from
saying
something
in
which
the
words
"my
aunt
Norris"
were
distinguishable.
"I
understand,"
cried
her
uncle,
recollecting
himself,
and
not
wanting
to
hear
more:
"I
understand.
Your
aunt
Norris
has
always
been
an
advocate,
and
very
judiciously,
for
young
people's
being
brought
up
without
unnecessary
indulgences;
but
there
should
be
moderation
in
everything.
She
is
also
very
hardy
herself,
which
of
course
will
influence
her
in
her
opinion
of
the
wants
of
others.
And
on
another
account,
too,
I
can
perfectly
comprehend.
I
know
what
her
sentiments
have
always
been.
The
principle
was
good
in
itself,
but
it
may
have
been,
and
I
believe
has
been,
carried
too
far
in
your
case.
I
am
aware
that
there
has
been
sometimes,
in
some
points,
a
misplaced
distinction;
but
I
think
too
well
of
you,
Fanny,
to
suppose
you
will
ever
harbour
resentment
on
that
account.
You
have
an
understanding
which
will
prevent
you
from
receiving
things
only
in
part,
and
judging
partially
by
the
event.
You
will
take
in
the
whole
of
the
past,
you
will
consider
times,
persons,
and
probabilities,
and
you
will
feel
that
they
were
not
least
your
friends
who
were
educating
and
preparing
you
for
that
mediocrity
of
condition
which
seemed
to
be
your
lot.
Though
their
caution
may
prove
eventually
unnecessary,
it
was
kindly
meant;
and
of
this
you
may
be
assured,
that
every
advantage
of
affluence
will
be
doubled
by
the
little
privations
and
restrictions
that
may
have
been
imposed.
I
am
sure
you
will
not
disappoint
my
opinion
of
you,
by
failing
at
any
time
to
treat
your
aunt
Norris
with
the
respect
and
attention
that
are
due
to
her.
But
enough
of
this.
Sit
down,
my
dear.
I
must
speak
to
you
for
a
few
minutes,
but
I
will
not
detain
you
long."
Fanny
obeyed,
with
eyes
cast
down
and
colour
rising.
After
a
moment's
pause,
Sir
Thomas,
trying
to
suppress
a
smile,
went
on.
"You
are
not
aware,
perhaps,
that
I
have
had
a
visitor
this
morning.
I
had
not
been
long
in
my
own
room,
after
breakfast,
when
Mr.
Crawford
was
shewn
in.
His
errand
you
may
probably
conjecture."
Fanny's
colour
grew
deeper
and
deeper;
and
her
uncle,
perceiving
that
she
was
embarrassed
to
a
degree
that
made
either
speaking
or
looking
up
quite
impossible,
turned
away
his
own
eyes,
and
without
any
farther
pause
proceeded
in
his
account
of
Mr.
Crawford's
visit.
Mr.
Crawford's
business
had
been
to
declare
himself
the
lover
of
Fanny,
make
decided
proposals
for
her,
and
entreat
the
sanction
of
the
uncle,
who
seemed
to
stand
in
the
place
of
her
parents;
and
he
had
done
it
all
so
well,
so
openly,
so
liberally,
so
properly,
that
Sir
Thomas,
feeling,
moreover,
his
own
replies,
and
his
own
remarks
to
have
been
very
much
to
the
purpose,
was
exceedingly
happy
to
give
the
particulars
of
their
conversation;
and
little
aware
of
what
was
passing
in
his
niece's
mind,
conceived
that
by
such
details
he
must
be
gratifying
her
far
more
than
himself.
He
talked,
therefore,
for
several
minutes
without
Fanny's
daring
to
interrupt
him.
She
had
hardly
even
attained
the
wish
to
do
it.
Her
mind
was
in
too
much
confusion.
She
had
changed
her
position;
and,
with
her
eyes
fixed
intently
on
one
of
the
windows,
was
listening
to
her
uncle
in
the
utmost
perturbation
and
dismay.
For
a
moment
he
ceased,
but
she
had
barely
become
conscious
of
it,
when,
rising
from
his
chair,
he
said,
"And
now,
Fanny,
having
performed
one
part
of
my
commission,
and
shewn
you
everything
placed
on
a
basis
the
most
assured
and
satisfactory,
I
may
execute
the
remainder
by
prevailing
on
you
to
accompany
me
downstairs,
where,
though
I
cannot
but
presume
on
having
been
no
unacceptable
companion
myself,
I
must
submit
to
your
finding
one
still
better
worth
listening
to.
Mr.
Crawford,
as
you
have
perhaps
foreseen,
is
yet
in
the
house.
He
is
in
my
room,
and
hoping
to
see
you
there."
There
was
a
look,
a
start,
an
exclamation
on
hearing
this,
which
astonished
Sir
Thomas;
but
what
was
his
increase
of
astonishment
on
hearing
her
exclaim
"Oh!
no,
sir,
I
cannot,
indeed
I
cannot
go
down
to
him.
Mr.
Crawford
ought
to
know
he
must
know
that:
I
told
him
enough
yesterday
to
convince
him;
he
spoke
to
me
on
this
subject
yesterday,
and
I
told
him
without
disguise
that
it
was
very
disagreeable
to
me,
and
quite
out
of
my
power
to
return
his
good
opinion."
"I
do
not
catch
your
meaning,"
said
Sir
Thomas,
sitting
down
again.
"Out
of
your
power
to
return
his
good
opinion?
What
is
all
this?
I
know
he
spoke
to
you
yesterday,
and
(as
far
as
I
understand)
received
as
much
encouragement
to
proceed
as
a
well
judging
young
woman
could
permit
herself
to
give.
I
was
very
much
pleased
with
what
I
collected
to
have
been
your
behaviour
on
the
occasion;
it
shewed
a
discretion
highly
to
be
commended.
But
now,
when
he
has
made
his
overtures
so
properly,
and
honourably
what
are
your
scruples
now?"
"You
are
mistaken,
sir,"
cried
Fanny,
forced
by
the
anxiety
of
the
moment
even
to
tell
her
uncle
that
he
was
wrong;
"you
are
quite
mistaken.
How
could
Mr.
Crawford
say
such
a
thing?
I
gave
him
no
encouragement
yesterday.
On
the
contrary,
I
told
him,
I
cannot
recollect
my
exact
words,
but
I
am
sure
I
told
him
that
I
would
not
listen
to
him,
that
it
was
very
unpleasant
to
me
in
every
respect,
and
that
I
begged
him
never
to
talk
to
me
in
that
manner
again.
I
am
sure
I
said
as
much
as
that
and
more;
and
I
should
have
said
still
more,
if
I
had
been
quite
certain
of
his
meaning
anything
seriously;
but
I
did
not
like
to
be,
I
could
not
bear
to
be,
imputing
more
than
might
be
intended.
I
thought
it
might
all
pass
for
nothing
with
him."
She
could
say
no
more;
her
breath
was
almost
gone.
"Am
I
to
understand,"
said
Sir
Thomas,
after
a
few
moments'
silence,
"that
you
mean
to
refuse
Mr.
Crawford?"
"Yes,
sir."
"Refuse
him?"
"Yes,
sir."
"Refuse
Mr.
Crawford!
Upon
what
plea?
For
what
reason?"
"I
I
cannot
like
him,
sir,
well
enough
to
marry
him."
"This
is
very
strange!"
said
Sir
Thomas,
in
a
voice
of
calm
displeasure.
"There
is
something
in
this
which
my
comprehension
does
not
reach.
Here
is
a
young
man
wishing
to
pay
his
addresses
to
you,
with
everything
to
recommend
him:
not
merely
situation
in
life,
fortune,
and
character,
but
with
more
than
common
agreeableness,
with
address
and
conversation
pleasing
to
everybody.
And
he
is
not
an
acquaintance
of
to
day;
you
have
now
known
him
some
time.
His
sister,
moreover,
is
your
intimate
friend,
and
he
has
been
doing
that
for
your
brother,
which
I
should
suppose
would
have
been
almost
sufficient
recommendation
to
you,
had
there
been
no
other.
It
is
very
uncertain
when
my
interest
might
have
got
William
on.
He
has
done
it
already."
"Yes,"
said
Fanny,
in
a
faint
voice,
and
looking
down
with
fresh
shame;
and
she
did
feel
almost
ashamed
of
herself,
after
such
a
picture
as
her
uncle
had
drawn,
for
not
liking
Mr.
Crawford.
"You
must
have
been
aware,"
continued
Sir
Thomas
presently,
"you
must
have
been
some
time
aware
of
a
particularity
in
Mr.
Crawford's
manners
to
you.
This
cannot
have
taken
you
by
surprise.
You
must
have
observed
his
attentions;
and
though
you
always
received
them
very
properly
(I
have
no
accusation
to
make
on
that
head),
I
never
perceived
them
to
be
unpleasant
to
you.
I
am
half
inclined
to
think,
Fanny,
that
you
do
not
quite
know
your
own
feelings."
"Oh
yes,
sir!
indeed
I
do.
His
attentions
were
always
what
I
did
not
like."
Sir
Thomas
looked
at
her
with
deeper
surprise.
"This
is
beyond
me,"
said
he.
"This
requires
explanation.
Young
as
you
are,
and
having
seen
scarcely
any
one,
it
is
hardly
possible
that
your
affections
"
He
paused
and
eyed
her
fixedly.
He
saw
her
lips
formed
into
a
no,
though
the
sound
was
inarticulate,
but
her
face
was
like
scarlet.
That,
however,
in
so
modest
a
girl,
might
be
very
compatible
with
innocence;
and
chusing
at
least
to
appear
satisfied,
he
quickly
added,
"No,
no,
I
know
that
is
quite
out
of
the
question;
quite
impossible.
Well,
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said."
And
for
a
few
minutes
he
did
say
nothing.
He
was
deep
in
thought.
His
niece
was
deep
in
thought
likewise,
trying
to
harden
and
prepare
herself
against
farther
questioning.
She
would
rather
die
than
own
the
truth;
and
she
hoped,
by
a
little
reflection,
to
fortify
herself
beyond
betraying
it.
"Independently
of
the
interest
which
Mr.
Crawford's
choice
seemed
to
justify"
said
Sir
Thomas,
beginning
again,
and
very
composedly,
"his
wishing
to
marry
at
all
so
early
is
recommendatory
to
me.
I
am
an
advocate
for
early
marriages,
where
there
are
means
in
proportion,
and
would
have
every
young
man,
with
a
sufficient
income,
settle
as
soon
after
four
and
twenty
as
he
can.
This
is
so
much
my
opinion,
that
I
am
sorry
to
think
how
little
likely
my
own
eldest
son,
your
cousin,
Mr.
Bertram,
is
to
marry
early;
but
at
present,
as
far
as
I
can
judge,
matrimony
makes
no
part
of
his
plans
or
thoughts.
I
wish
he
were
more
likely
to
fix."
Here
was
a
glance
at
Fanny.
"Edmund,
I
consider,
from
his
dispositions
and
habits,
as
much
more
likely
to
marry
early
than
his
brother.
He,
indeed,
I
have
lately
thought,
has
seen
the
woman
he
could
love,
which,
I
am
convinced,
my
eldest
son
has
not.
Am
I
right?
Do
you
agree
with
me,
my
dear?"
"Yes,
sir."
It
was
gently,
but
it
was
calmly
said,
and
Sir
Thomas
was
easy
on
the
score
of
the
cousins.
But
the
removal
of
his
alarm
did
his
niece
no
service:
as
her
unaccountableness
was
confirmed
his
displeasure
increased;
and
getting
up
and
walking
about
the
room
with
a
frown,
which
Fanny
could
picture
to
herself,
though
she
dared
not
lift
up
her
eyes,
he
shortly
afterwards,
and
in
a
voice
of
authority,
said,
"Have
you
any
reason,
child,
to
think
ill
of
Mr.
Crawford's
temper?"
"No,
sir."
She
longed
to
add,
"But
of
his
principles
I
have";
but
her
heart
sunk
under
the
appalling
prospect
of
discussion,
explanation,
and
probably
non
conviction.
Her
ill
opinion
of
him
was
founded
chiefly
on
observations,
which,
for
her
cousins'
sake,
she
could
scarcely
dare
mention
to
their
father.
Maria
and
Julia,
and
especially
Maria,
were
so
closely
implicated
in
Mr.
Crawford's
misconduct,
that
she
could
not
give
his
character,
such
as
she
believed
it,
without
betraying
them.
She
had
hoped
that,
to
a
man
like
her
uncle,
so
discerning,
so
honourable,
so
good,
the
simple
acknowledgment
of
settled
dislike
on
her
side
would
have
been
sufficient.
To
her
infinite
grief
she
found
it
was
not.
Sir
Thomas
came
towards
the
table
where
she
sat
in
trembling
wretchedness,
and
with
a
good
deal
of
cold
sternness,
said,
"It
is
of
no
use,
I
perceive,
to
talk
to
you.
We
had
better
put
an
end
to
this
most
mortifying
conference.
Mr.
Crawford
must
not
be
kept
longer
waiting.
I
will,
therefore,
only
add,
as
thinking
it
my
duty
to
mark
my
opinion
of
your
conduct,
that
you
have
disappointed
every
expectation
I
had
formed,
and
proved
yourself
of
a
character
the
very
reverse
of
what
I
had
supposed.
For
I
had,
Fanny,
as
I
think
my
behaviour
must
have
shewn,
formed
a
very
favourable
opinion
of
you
from
the
period
of
my
return
to
England.
I
had
thought
you
peculiarly
free
from
wilfulness
of
temper,
self
conceit,
and
every
tendency
to
that
independence
of
spirit
which
prevails
so
much
in
modern
days,
even
in
young
women,
and
which
in
young
women
is
offensive
and
disgusting
beyond
all
common
offence.
But
you
have
now
shewn
me
that
you
can
be
wilful
and
perverse;
that
you
can
and
will
decide
for
yourself,
without
any
consideration
or
deference
for
those
who
have
surely
some
right
to
guide
you,
without
even
asking
their
advice.
You
have
shewn
yourself
very,
very
different
from
anything
that
I
had
imagined.
The
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
your
family,
of
your
parents,
your
brothers
and
sisters,
never
seems
to
have
had
a
moment's
share
in
your
thoughts
on
this
occasion.
How
they
might
be
benefited,
how
they
must
rejoice
in
such
an
establishment
for
you,
is
nothing
to
you.
You
think
only
of
yourself,
and
because
you
do
not
feel
for
Mr.
Crawford
exactly
what
a
young
heated
fancy
imagines
to
be
necessary
for
happiness,
you
resolve
to
refuse
him
at
once,
without
wishing
even
for
a
little
time
to
consider
of
it,
a
little
more
time
for
cool
consideration,
and
for
really
examining
your
own
inclinations;
and
are,
in
a
wild
fit
of
folly,
throwing
away
from
you
such
an
opportunity
of
being
settled
in
life,
eligibly,
honourably,
nobly
settled,
as
will,
probably,
never
occur
to
you
again.
Here
is
a
young
man
of
sense,
of
character,
of
temper,
of
manners,
and
of
fortune,
exceedingly
attached
to
you,
and
seeking
your
hand
in
the
most
handsome
and
disinterested
way;
and
let
me
tell
you,
Fanny,
that
you
may
live
eighteen
years
longer
in
the
world
without
being
addressed
by
a
man
of
half
Mr.
Crawford's
estate,
or
a
tenth
part
of
his
merits.
Gladly
would
I
have
bestowed
either
of
my
own
daughters
on
him.
Maria
is
nobly
married;
but
had
Mr.
Crawford
sought
Julia's
hand,
I
should
have
given
it
to
him
with
superior
and
more
heartfelt
satisfaction
than
I
gave
Maria's
to
Mr.
Rushworth."
After
half
a
moment's
pause:
"And
I
should
have
been
very
much
surprised
had
either
of
my
daughters,
on
receiving
a
proposal
of
marriage
at
any
time
which
might
carry
with
it
only
half
the
eligibility
of
this,
immediately
and
peremptorily,
and
without
paying
my
opinion
or
my
regard
the
compliment
of
any
consultation,
put
a
decided
negative
on
it.
I
should
have
been
much
surprised
and
much
hurt
by
such
a
proceeding.
I
should
have
thought
it
a
gross
violation
of
duty
and
respect.
You
are
not
to
be
judged
by
the
same
rule.
You
do
not
owe
me
the
duty
of
a
child.
But,
Fanny,
if
your
heart
can
acquit
you
of
ingratitude
"
He
ceased.
Fanny
was
by
this
time
crying
so
bitterly
that,
angry
as
he
was,
he
would
not
press
that
article
farther.
Her
heart
was
almost
broke
by
such
a
picture
of
what
she
appeared
to
him;
by
such
accusations,
so
heavy,
so
multiplied,
so
rising
in
dreadful
gradation!
Self
willed,
obstinate,
selfish,
and
ungrateful.
He
thought
her
all
this.
She
had
deceived
his
expectations;
she
had
lost
his
good
opinion.
What
was
to
become
of
her?
"I
am
very
sorry,"
said
she
inarticulately,
through
her
tears,
"I
am
very
sorry
indeed."
"Sorry!
yes,
I
hope
you
are
sorry;
and
you
will
probably
have
reason
to
be
long
sorry
for
this
day's
transactions."
"If
it
were
possible
for
me
to
do
otherwise"
said
she,
with
another
strong
effort;
"but
I
am
so
perfectly
convinced
that
I
could
never
make
him
happy,
and
that
I
should
be
miserable
myself."
Another
burst
of
tears;
but
in
spite
of
that
burst,
and
in
spite
of
that
great
black
word
miserable,
which
served
to
introduce
it,
Sir
Thomas
began
to
think
a
little
relenting,
a
little
change
of
inclination,
might
have
something
to
do
with
it;
and
to
augur
favourably
from
the
personal
entreaty
of
the
young
man
himself.
He
knew
her
to
be
very
timid,
and
exceedingly
nervous;
and
thought
it
not
improbable
that
her
mind
might
be
in
such
a
state
as
a
little
time,
a
little
pressing,
a
little
patience,
and
a
little
impatience,
a
judicious
mixture
of
all
on
the
lover's
side,
might
work
their
usual
effect
on.
If
the
gentleman
would
but
persevere,
if
he
had
but
love
enough
to
persevere,
Sir
Thomas
began
to
have
hopes;
and
these
reflections
having
passed
across
his
mind
and
cheered
it,
"Well,"
said
he,
in
a
tone
of
becoming
gravity,
but
of
less
anger,
"well,
child,
dry
up
your
tears.
There
is
no
use
in
these
tears;
they
can
do
no
good.
You
must
now
come
downstairs
with
me.
Mr.
Crawford
has
been
kept
waiting
too
long
already.
You
must
give
him
your
own
answer:
we
cannot
expect
him
to
be
satisfied
with
less;
and
you
only
can
explain
to
him
the
grounds
of
that
misconception
of
your
sentiments,
which,
unfortunately
for
himself,
he
certainly
has
imbibed.
I
am
totally
unequal
to
it."
But
Fanny
shewed
such
reluctance,
such
misery,
at
the
idea
of
going
down
to
him,
that
Sir
Thomas,
after
a
little
consideration,
judged
it
better
to
indulge
her.
His
hopes
from
both
gentleman
and
lady
suffered
a
small
depression
in
consequence;
but
when
he
looked
at
his
niece,
and
saw
the
state
of
feature
and
complexion
which
her
crying
had
brought
her
into,
he
thought
there
might
be
as
much
lost
as
gained
by
an
immediate
interview.
With
a
few
words,
therefore,
of
no
particular
meaning,
he
walked
off
by
himself,
leaving
his
poor
niece
to
sit
and
cry
over
what
had
passed,
with
very
wretched
feelings.
Her
mind
was
all
disorder.
The
past,
present,
future,
everything
was
terrible.
But
her
uncle's
anger
gave
her
the
severest
pain
of
all.
Selfish
and
ungrateful!
to
have
appeared
so
to
him!
She
was
miserable
for
ever.
She
had
no
one
to
take
her
part,
to
counsel,
or
speak
for
her.
Her
only
friend
was
absent.
He
might
have
softened
his
father;
but
all,
perhaps
all,
would
think
her
selfish
and
ungrateful.
She
might
have
to
endure
the
reproach
again
and
again;
she
might
hear
it,
or
see
it,
or
know
it
to
exist
for
ever
in
every
connexion
about
her.
She
could
not
but
feel
some
resentment
against
Mr.
Crawford;
yet,
if
he
really
loved
her,
and
were
unhappy
too!
It
was
all
wretchedness
together.
In
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
her
uncle
returned;
she
was
almost
ready
to
faint
at
the
sight
of
him.
He
spoke
calmly,
however,
without
austerity,
without
reproach,
and
she
revived
a
little.
There
was
comfort,
too,
in
his
words,
as
well
as
his
manner,
for
he
began
with,
"Mr.
Crawford
is
gone:
he
has
just
left
me.
I
need
not
repeat
what
has
passed.
I
do
not
want
to
add
to
anything
you
may
now
be
feeling,
by
an
account
of
what
he
has
felt.
Suffice
it,
that
he
has
behaved
in
the
most
gentlemanlike
and
generous
manner,
and
has
confirmed
me
in
a
most
favourable
opinion
of
his
understanding,
heart,
and
temper.
Upon
my
representation
of
what
you
were
suffering,
he
immediately,
and
with
the
greatest
delicacy,
ceased
to
urge
to
see
you
for
the
present."
Here
Fanny,
who
had
looked
up,
looked
down
again.
"Of
course,"
continued
her
uncle,
"it
cannot
be
supposed
but
that
he
should
request
to
speak
with
you
alone,
be
it
only
for
five
minutes;
a
request
too
natural,
a
claim
too
just
to
be
denied.
But
there
is
no
time
fixed;
perhaps
to
morrow,
or
whenever
your
spirits
are
composed
enough.
For
the
present
you
have
only
to
tranquillise
yourself.
Check
these
tears;
they
do
but
exhaust
you.
If,
as
I
am
willing
to
suppose,
you
wish
to
shew
me
any
observance,
you
will
not
give
way
to
these
emotions,
but
endeavour
to
reason
yourself
into
a
stronger
frame
of
mind.
I
advise
you
to
go
out:
the
air
will
do
you
good;
go
out
for
an
hour
on
the
gravel;
you
will
have
the
shrubbery
to
yourself,
and
will
be
the
better
for
air
and
exercise.
And,
Fanny"
(turning
back
again
for
a
moment),
"I
shall
make
no
mention
below
of
what
has
passed;
I
shall
not
even
tell
your
aunt
Bertram.
There
is
no
occasion
for
spreading
the
disappointment;
say
nothing
about
it
yourself."
This
was
an
order
to
be
most
joyfully
obeyed;
this
was
an
act
of
kindness
which
Fanny
felt
at
her
heart.
To
be
spared
from
her
aunt
Norris's
interminable
reproaches!
he
left
her
in
a
glow
of
gratitude.
Anything
might
be
bearable
rather
than
such
reproaches.
Even
to
see
Mr.
Crawford
would
be
less
overpowering.
She
walked
out
directly,
as
her
uncle
recommended,
and
followed
his
advice
throughout,
as
far
as
she
could;
did
check
her
tears;
did
earnestly
try
to
compose
her
spirits
and
strengthen
her
mind.
She
wished
to
prove
to
him
that
she
did
desire
his
comfort,
and
sought
to
regain
his
favour;
and
he
had
given
her
another
strong
motive
for
exertion,
in
keeping
the
whole
affair
from
the
knowledge
of
her
aunts.
Not
to
excite
suspicion
by
her
look
or
manner
was
now
an
object
worth
attaining;
and
she
felt
equal
to
almost
anything
that
might
save
her
from
her
aunt
Norris.
She
was
struck,
quite
struck,
when,
on
returning
from
her
walk
and
going
into
the
East
room
again,
the
first
thing
which
caught
her
eye
was
a
fire
lighted
and
burning.
A
fire!
it
seemed
too
much;
just
at
that
time
to
be
giving
her
such
an
indulgence
was
exciting
even
painful
gratitude.
She
wondered
that
Sir
Thomas
could
have
leisure
to
think
of
such
a
trifle
again;
but
she
soon
found,
from
the
voluntary
information
of
the
housemaid,
who
came
in
to
attend
it,
that
so
it
was
to
be
every
day.
Sir
Thomas
had
given
orders
for
it.
"I
must
be
a
brute,
indeed,
if
I
can
be
really
ungrateful!"
said
she,
in
soliloquy.
"Heaven
defend
me
from
being
ungrateful!"
She
saw
nothing
more
of
her
uncle,
nor
of
her
aunt
Norris,
till
they
met
at
dinner.
Her
uncle's
behaviour
to
her
was
then
as
nearly
as
possible
what
it
had
been
before;
she
was
sure
he
did
not
mean
there
should
be
any
change,
and
that
it
was
only
her
own
conscience
that
could
fancy
any;
but
her
aunt
was
soon
quarrelling
with
her;
and
when
she
found
how
much
and
how
unpleasantly
her
having
only
walked
out
without
her
aunt's
knowledge
could
be
dwelt
on,
she
felt
all
the
reason
she
had
to
bless
the
kindness
which
saved
her
from
the
same
spirit
of
reproach,
exerted
on
a
more
momentous
subject.
"If
I
had
known
you
were
going
out,
I
should
have
got
you
just
to
go
as
far
as
my
house
with
some
orders
for
Nanny,"
said
she,
"which
I
have
since,
to
my
very
great
inconvenience,
been
obliged
to
go
and
carry
myself.
I
could
very
ill
spare
the
time,
and
you
might
have
saved
me
the
trouble,
if
you
would
only
have
been
so
good
as
to
let
us
know
you
were
going
out.
It
would
have
made
no
difference
to
you,
I
suppose,
whether
you
had
walked
in
the
shrubbery
or
gone
to
my
house."
"I
recommended
the
shrubbery
to
Fanny
as
the
driest
place,"
said
Sir
Thomas.
"Oh!"
said
Mrs.
Norris,
with
a
moment's
check,
"that
was
very
kind
of
you,
Sir
Thomas;
but
you
do
not
know
how
dry
the
path
is
to
my
house.
Fanny
would
have
had
quite
as
good
a
walk
there,
I
assure
you,
with
the
advantage
of
being
of
some
use,
and
obliging
her
aunt:
it
is
all
her
fault.
If
she
would
but
have
let
us
know
she
was
going
out
but
there
is
a
something
about
Fanny,
I
have
often
observed
it
before
she
likes
to
go
her
own
way
to
work;
she
does
not
like
to
be
dictated
to;
she
takes
her
own
independent
walk
whenever
she
can;
she
certainly
has
a
little
spirit
of
secrecy,
and
independence,
and
nonsense,
about
her,
which
I
would
advise
her
to
get
the
better
of."
As
a
general
reflection
on
Fanny,
Sir
Thomas
thought
nothing
could
be
more
unjust,
though
he
had
been
so
lately
expressing
the
same
sentiments
himself,
and
he
tried
to
turn
the
conversation:
tried
repeatedly
before
he
could
succeed;
for
Mrs.
Norris
had
not
discernment
enough
to
perceive,
either
now,
or
at
any
other
time,
to
what
degree
he
thought
well
of
his
niece,
or
how
very
far
he
was
from
wishing
to
have
his
own
children's
merits
set
off
by
the
depreciation
of
hers.
She
was
talking
at
Fanny,
and
resenting
this
private
walk
half
through
the
dinner.
It
was
over,
however,
at
last;
and
the
evening
set
in
with
more
composure
to
Fanny,
and
more
cheerfulness
of
spirits
than
she
could
have
hoped
for
after
so
stormy
a
morning;
but
she
trusted,
in
the
first
place,
that
she
had
done
right:
that
her
judgment
had
not
misled
her.
For
the
purity
of
her
intentions
she
could
answer;
and
she
was
willing
to
hope,
secondly,
that
her
uncle's
displeasure
was
abating,
and
would
abate
farther
as
he
considered
the
matter
with
more
impartiality,
and
felt,
as
a
good
man
must
feel,
how
wretched,
and
how
unpardonable,
how
hopeless,
and
how
wicked
it
was
to
marry
without
affection.
When
the
meeting
with
which
she
was
threatened
for
the
morrow
was
past,
she
could
not
but
flatter
herself
that
the
subject
would
be
finally
concluded,
and
Mr.
Crawford
once
gone
from
Mansfield,
that
everything
would
soon
be
as
if
no
such
subject
had
existed.
She
would
not,
could
not
believe,
that
Mr.
Crawford's
affection
for
her
could
distress
him
long;
his
mind
was
not
of
that
sort.
London
would
soon
bring
its
cure.
In
London
he
would
soon
learn
to
wonder
at
his
infatuation,
and
be
thankful
for
the
right
reason
in
her
which
had
saved
him
from
its
evil
consequences.
While
Fanny's
mind
was
engaged
in
these
sort
of
hopes,
her
uncle
was,
soon
after
tea,
called
out
of
the
room;
an
occurrence
too
common
to
strike
her,
and
she
thought
nothing
of
it
till
the
butler
reappeared
ten
minutes
afterwards,
and
advancing
decidedly
towards
herself,
said,
"Sir
Thomas
wishes
to
speak
with
you,
ma'am,
in
his
own
room."
Then
it
occurred
to
her
what
might
be
going
on;
a
suspicion
rushed
over
her
mind
which
drove
the
colour
from
her
cheeks;
but
instantly
rising,
she
was
preparing
to
obey,
when
Mrs.
Norris
called
out,
"Stay,
stay,
Fanny!
what
are
you
about?
where
are
you
going?
don't
be
in
such
a
hurry.
Depend
upon
it,
it
is
not
you
who
are
wanted;
depend
upon
it,
it
is
me"
(looking
at
the
butler);
"but
you
are
so
very
eager
to
put
yourself
forward.
What
should
Sir
Thomas
want
you
for?
It
is
me,
Baddeley,
you
mean;
I
am
coming
this
moment.
You
mean
me,
Baddeley,
I
am
sure;
Sir
Thomas
wants
me,
not
Miss
Price."
But
Baddeley
was
stout.
"No,
ma'am,
it
is
Miss
Price;
I
am
certain
of
its
being
Miss
Price."
And
there
was
a
half
smile
with
the
words,
which
meant,
"I
do
not
think
you
would
answer
the
purpose
at
all."
Mrs.
Norris,
much
discontented,
was
obliged
to
compose
herself
to
work
again;
and
Fanny,
walking
off
in
agitating
consciousness,
found
herself,
as
she
anticipated,
in
another
minute
alone
with
Mr.
Crawford.
The
conference
was
neither
so
short
nor
so
conclusive
as
the
lady
had
designed.
The
gentleman
was
not
so
easily
satisfied.
He
had
all
the
disposition
to
persevere
that
Sir
Thomas
could
wish
him.
He
had
vanity,
which
strongly
inclined
him
in
the
first
place
to
think
she
did
love
him,
though
she
might
not
know
it
herself;
and
which,
secondly,
when
constrained
at
last
to
admit
that
she
did
know
her
own
present
feelings,
convinced
him
that
he
should
be
able
in
time
to
make
those
feelings
what
he
wished.
He
was
in
love,
very
much
in
love;
and
it
was
a
love
which,
operating
on
an
active,
sanguine
spirit,
of
more
warmth
than
delicacy,
made
her
affection
appear
of
greater
consequence
because
it
was
withheld,
and
determined
him
to
have
the
glory,
as
well
as
the
felicity,
of
forcing
her
to
love
him.
He
would
not
despair:
he
would
not
desist.
He
had
every
well
grounded
reason
for
solid
attachment;
he
knew
her
to
have
all
the
worth
that
could
justify
the
warmest
hopes
of
lasting
happiness
with
her;
her
conduct
at
this
very
time,
by
speaking
the
disinterestedness
and
delicacy
of
her
character
(qualities
which
he
believed
most
rare
indeed),
was
of
a
sort
to
heighten
all
his
wishes,
and
confirm
all
his
resolutions.
He
knew
not
that
he
had
a
pre
engaged
heart
to
attack.
Of
that
he
had
no
suspicion.
He
considered
her
rather
as
one
who
had
never
thought
on
the
subject
enough
to
be
in
danger;
who
had
been
guarded
by
youth,
a
youth
of
mind
as
lovely
as
of
person;
whose
modesty
had
prevented
her
from
understanding
his
attentions,
and
who
was
still
overpowered
by
the
suddenness
of
addresses
so
wholly
unexpected,
and
the
novelty
of
a
situation
which
her
fancy
had
never
taken
into
account.
Must
it
not
follow
of
course,
that,
when
he
was
understood,
he
should
succeed?
He
believed
it
fully.
Love
such
as
his,
in
a
man
like
himself,
must
with
perseverance
secure
a
return,
and
at
no
great
distance;
and
he
had
so
much
delight
in
the
idea
of
obliging
her
to
love
him
in
a
very
short
time,
that
her
not
loving
him
now
was
scarcely
regretted.
A
little
difficulty
to
be
overcome
was
no
evil
to
Henry
Crawford.
He
rather
derived
spirits
from
it.
He
had
been
apt
to
gain
hearts
too
easily.
His
situation
was
new
and
animating.
To
Fanny,
however,
who
had
known
too
much
opposition
all
her
life
to
find
any
charm
in
it,
all
this
was
unintelligible.
She
found
that
he
did
mean
to
persevere;
but
how
he
could,
after
such
language
from
her
as
she
felt
herself
obliged
to
use,
was
not
to
be
understood.
She
told
him
that
she
did
not
love
him,
could
not
love
him,
was
sure
she
never
should
love
him;
that
such
a
change
was
quite
impossible;
that
the
subject
was
most
painful
to
her;
that
she
must
entreat
him
never
to
mention
it
again,
to
allow
her
to
leave
him
at
once,
and
let
it
be
considered
as
concluded
for
ever.
And
when
farther
pressed,
had
added,
that
in
her
opinion
their
dispositions
were
so
totally
dissimilar
as
to
make
mutual
affection
incompatible;
and
that
they
were
unfitted
for
each
other
by
nature,
education,
and
habit.
All
this
she
had
said,
and
with
the
earnestness
of
sincerity;
yet
this
was
not
enough,
for
he
immediately
denied
there
being
anything
uncongenial
in
their
characters,
or
anything
unfriendly
in
their
situations;
and
positively
declared,
that
he
would
still
love,
and
still
hope!
Fanny
knew
her
own
meaning,
but
was
no
judge
of
her
own
manner.
Her
manner
was
incurably
gentle;
and
she
was
not
aware
how
much
it
concealed
the
sternness
of
her
purpose.
Her
diffidence,
gratitude,
and
softness
made
every
expression
of
indifference
seem
almost
an
effort
of
self
denial;
seem,
at
least,
to
be
giving
nearly
as
much
pain
to
herself
as
to
him.
Mr.
Crawford
was
no
longer
the
Mr.
Crawford
who,
as
the
clandestine,
insidious,
treacherous
admirer
of
Maria
Bertram,
had
been
her
abhorrence,
whom
she
had
hated
to
see
or
to
speak
to,
in
whom
she
could
believe
no
good
quality
to
exist,
and
whose
power,
even
of
being
agreeable,
she
had
barely
acknowledged.
He
was
now
the
Mr.
Crawford
who
was
addressing
herself
with
ardent,
disinterested
love;
whose
feelings
were
apparently
become
all
that
was
honourable
and
upright,
whose
views
of
happiness
were
all
fixed
on
a
marriage
of
attachment;
who
was
pouring
out
his
sense
of
her
merits,
describing
and
describing
again
his
affection,
proving
as
far
as
words
could
prove
it,
and
in
the
language,
tone,
and
spirit
of
a
man
of
talent
too,
that
he
sought
her
for
her
gentleness
and
her
goodness;
and
to
complete
the
whole,
he
was
now
the
Mr.
Crawford
who
had
procured
William's
promotion!
Here
was
a
change,
and
here
were
claims
which
could
not
but
operate!
She
might
have
disdained
him
in
all
the
dignity
of
angry
virtue,
in
the
grounds
of
Sotherton,
or
the
theatre
at
Mansfield
Park;
but
he
approached
her
now
with
rights
that
demanded
different
treatment.
She
must
be
courteous,
and
she
must
be
compassionate.
She
must
have
a
sensation
of
being
honoured,
and
whether
thinking
of
herself
or
her
brother,
she
must
have
a
strong
feeling
of
gratitude.
The
effect
of
the
whole
was
a
manner
so
pitying
and
agitated,
and
words
intermingled
with
her
refusal
so
expressive
of
obligation
and
concern,
that
to
a
temper
of
vanity
and
hope
like
Crawford's,
the
truth,
or
at
least
the
strength
of
her
indifference,
might
well
be
questionable;
and
he
was
not
so
irrational
as
Fanny
considered
him,
in
the
professions
of
persevering,
assiduous,
and
not
desponding
attachment
which
closed
the
interview.
It
was
with
reluctance
that
he
suffered
her
to
go;
but
there
was
no
look
of
despair
in
parting
to
belie
his
words,
or
give
her
hopes
of
his
being
less
unreasonable
than
he
professed
himself.
Now
she
was
angry.
Some
resentment
did
arise
at
a
perseverance
so
selfish
and
ungenerous.
Here
was
again
a
want
of
delicacy
and
regard
for
others
which
had
formerly
so
struck
and
disgusted
her.
Here
was
again
a
something
of
the
same
Mr.
Crawford
whom
she
had
so
reprobated
before.
How
evidently
was
there
a
gross
want
of
feeling
and
humanity
where
his
own
pleasure
was
concerned;
and
alas!
how
always
known
no
principle
to
supply
as
a
duty
what
the
heart
was
deficient
in!
Had
her
own
affections
been
as
free
as
perhaps
they
ought
to
have
been,
he
never
could
have
engaged
them.
So
thought
Fanny,
in
good
truth
and
sober
sadness,
as
she
sat
musing
over
that
too
great
indulgence
and
luxury
of
a
fire
upstairs:
wondering
at
the
past
and
present;
wondering
at
what
was
yet
to
come,
and
in
a
nervous
agitation
which
made
nothing
clear
to
her
but
the
persuasion
of
her
being
never
under
any
circumstances
able
to
love
Mr.
Crawford,
and
the
felicity
of
having
a
fire
to
sit
over
and
think
of
it.
Sir
Thomas
was
obliged,
or
obliged
himself,
to
wait
till
the
morrow
for
a
knowledge
of
what
had
passed
between
the
young
people.
He
then
saw
Mr.
Crawford,
and
received
his
account.
The
first
feeling
was
disappointment:
he
had
hoped
better
things;
he
had
thought
that
an
hour's
entreaty
from
a
young
man
like
Crawford
could
not
have
worked
so
little
change
on
a
gentle
tempered
girl
like
Fanny;
but
there
was
speedy
comfort
in
the
determined
views
and
sanguine
perseverance
of
the
lover;
and
when
seeing
such
confidence
of
success
in
the
principal,
Sir
Thomas
was
soon
able
to
depend
on
it
himself.
Nothing
was
omitted,
on
his
side,
of
civility,
compliment,
or
kindness,
that
might
assist
the
plan.
Mr.
Crawford's
steadiness
was
honoured,
and
Fanny
was
praised,
and
the
connexion
was
still
the
most
desirable
in
the
world.
At
Mansfield
Park
Mr.
Crawford
would
always
be
welcome;
he
had
only
to
consult
his
own
judgment
and
feelings
as
to
the
frequency
of
his
visits,
at
present
or
in
future.
In
all
his
niece's
family
and
friends,
there
could
be
but
one
opinion,
one
wish
on
the
subject;
the
influence
of
all
who
loved
her
must
incline
one
way.
Everything
was
said
that
could
encourage,
every
encouragement
received
with
grateful
joy,
and
the
gentlemen
parted
the
best
of
friends.
Satisfied
that
the
cause
was
now
on
a
footing
the
most
proper
and
hopeful,
Sir
Thomas
resolved
to
abstain
from
all
farther
importunity
with
his
niece,
and
to
shew
no
open
interference.
Upon
her
disposition
he
believed
kindness
might
be
the
best
way
of
working.
Entreaty
should
be
from
one
quarter
only.
The
forbearance
of
her
family
on
a
point,
respecting
which
she
could
be
in
no
doubt
of
their
wishes,
might
be
their
surest
means
of
forwarding
it.
Accordingly,
on
this
principle,
Sir
Thomas
took
the
first
opportunity
of
saying
to
her,
with
a
mild
gravity,
intended
to
be
overcoming,
"Well,
Fanny,
I
have
seen
Mr.
Crawford
again,
and
learn
from
him
exactly
how
matters
stand
between
you.
He
is
a
most
extraordinary
young
man,
and
whatever
be
the
event,
you
must
feel
that
you
have
created
an
attachment
of
no
common
character;
though,
young
as
you
are,
and
little
acquainted
with
the
transient,
varying,
unsteady
nature
of
love,
as
it
generally
exists,
you
cannot
be
struck
as
I
am
with
all
that
is
wonderful
in
a
perseverance
of
this
sort
against
discouragement.
With
him
it
is
entirely
a
matter
of
feeling:
he
claims
no
merit
in
it;
perhaps
is
entitled
to
none.
Yet,
having
chosen
so
well,
his
constancy
has
a
respectable
stamp.
Had
his
choice
been
less
unexceptionable,
I
should
have
condemned
his
persevering."
"Indeed,
sir,"
said
Fanny,
"I
am
very
sorry
that
Mr.
Crawford
should
continue
to
know
that
it
is
paying
me
a
very
great
compliment,
and
I
feel
most
undeservedly
honoured;
but
I
am
so
perfectly
convinced,
and
I
have
told
him
so,
that
it
never
will
be
in
my
power
"
"My
dear,"
interrupted
Sir
Thomas,
"there
is
no
occasion
for
this.
Your
feelings
are
as
well
known
to
me
as
my
wishes
and
regrets
must
be
to
you.
There
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
or
done.
From
this
hour
the
subject
is
never
to
be
revived
between
us.
You
will
have
nothing
to
fear,
or
to
be
agitated
about.
You
cannot
suppose
me
capable
of
trying
to
persuade
you
to
marry
against
your
inclinations.
Your
happiness
and
advantage
are
all
that
I
have
in
view,
and
nothing
is
required
of
you
but
to
bear
with
Mr.
Crawford's
endeavours
to
convince
you
that
they
may
not
be
incompatible
with
his.
He
proceeds
at
his
own
risk.
You
are
on
safe
ground.
I
have
engaged
for
your
seeing
him
whenever
he
calls,
as
you
might
have
done
had
nothing
of
this
sort
occurred.
You
will
see
him
with
the
rest
of
us,
in
the
same
manner,
and,
as
much
as
you
can,
dismissing
the
recollection
of
everything
unpleasant.
He
leaves
Northamptonshire
so
soon,
that
even
this
slight
sacrifice
cannot
be
often
demanded.
The
future
must
be
very
uncertain.
And
now,
my
dear
Fanny,
this
subject
is
closed
between
us."
The
promised
departure
was
all
that
Fanny
could
think
of
with
much
satisfaction.
Her
uncle's
kind
expressions,
however,
and
forbearing
manner,
were
sensibly
felt;
and
when
she
considered
how
much
of
the
truth
was
unknown
to
him,
she
believed
she
had
no
right
to
wonder
at
the
line
of
conduct
he
pursued.
He,
who
had
married
a
daughter
to
Mr.
Rushworth:
romantic
delicacy
was
certainly
not
to
be
expected
from
him.
She
must
do
her
duty,
and
trust
that
time
might
make
her
duty
easier
than
it
now
was.
She
could
not,
though
only
eighteen,
suppose
Mr.
Crawford's
attachment
would
hold
out
for
ever;
she
could
not
but
imagine
that
steady,
unceasing
discouragement
from
herself
would
put
an
end
to
it
in
time.
How
much
time
she
might,
in
her
own
fancy,
allot
for
its
dominion,
is
another
concern.
It
would
not
be
fair
to
inquire
into
a
young
lady's
exact
estimate
of
her
own
perfections.
In
spite
of
his
intended
silence,
Sir
Thomas
found
himself
once
more
obliged
to
mention
the
subject
to
his
niece,
to
prepare
her
briefly
for
its
being
imparted
to
her
aunts;
a
measure
which
he
would
still
have
avoided,
if
possible,
but
which
became
necessary
from
the
totally
opposite
feelings
of
Mr.
Crawford
as
to
any
secrecy
of
proceeding.
He
had
no
idea
of
concealment.
It
was
all
known
at
the
Parsonage,
where
he
loved
to
talk
over
the
future
with
both
his
sisters,
and
it
would
be
rather
gratifying
to
him
to
have
enlightened
witnesses
of
the
progress
of
his
success.
When
Sir
Thomas
understood
this,
he
felt
the
necessity
of
making
his
own
wife
and
sister
in
law
acquainted
with
the
business
without
delay;
though,
on
Fanny's
account,
he
almost
dreaded
the
effect
of
the
communication
to
Mrs.
Norris
as
much
as
Fanny
herself.
He
deprecated
her
mistaken
but
well
meaning
zeal.
Sir
Thomas,
indeed,
was,
by
this
time,
not
very
far
from
classing
Mrs.
Norris
as
one
of
those
well
meaning
people
who
are
always
doing
mistaken
and
very
disagreeable
things.
Mrs.
Norris,
however,
relieved
him.
He
pressed
for
the
strictest
forbearance
and
silence
towards
their
niece;
she
not
only
promised,
but
did
observe
it.
She
only
looked
her
increased
ill
will.
Angry
she
was:
bitterly
angry;
but
she
was
more
angry
with
Fanny
for
having
received
such
an
offer
than
for
refusing
it.
It
was
an
injury
and
affront
to
Julia,
who
ought
to
have
been
Mr.
Crawford's
choice;
and,
independently
of
that,
she
disliked
Fanny,
because
she
had
neglected
her;
and
she
would
have
grudged
such
an
elevation
to
one
whom
she
had
been
always
trying
to
depress.
Sir
Thomas
gave
her
more
credit
for
discretion
on
the
occasion
than
she
deserved;
and
Fanny
could
have
blessed
her
for
allowing
her
only
to
see
her
displeasure,
and
not
to
hear
it.
Lady
Bertram
took
it
differently.
She
had
been
a
beauty,
and
a
prosperous
beauty,
all
her
life;
and
beauty
and
wealth
were
all
that
excited
her
respect.
To
know
Fanny
to
be
sought
in
marriage
by
a
man
of
fortune,
raised
her,
therefore,
very
much
in
her
opinion.
By
convincing
her
that
Fanny
was
very
pretty,
which
she
had
been
doubting
about
before,
and
that
she
would
be
advantageously
married,
it
made
her
feel
a
sort
of
credit
in
calling
her
niece.
"Well,
Fanny,"
said
she,
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
together
afterwards,
and
she
really
had
known
something
like
impatience
to
be
alone
with
her,
and
her
countenance,
as
she
spoke,
had
extraordinary
animation;
"Well,
Fanny,
I
have
had
a
very
agreeable
surprise
this
morning.
I
must
just
speak
of
it
once,
I
told
Sir
Thomas
I
must
once,
and
then
I
shall
have
done.
I
give
you
joy,
my
dear
niece."
And
looking
at
her
complacently,
she
added,
"Humph,
we
certainly
are
a
handsome
family!"
Fanny
coloured,
and
doubted
at
first
what
to
say;
when,
hoping
to
assail
her
on
her
vulnerable
side,
she
presently
answered
"My
dear
aunt,
you
cannot
wish
me
to
do
differently
from
what
I
have
done,
I
am
sure.
You
cannot
wish
me
to
marry;
for
you
would
miss
me,
should
not
you?
Yes,
I
am
sure
you
would
miss
me
too
much
for
that."
"No,
my
dear,
I
should
not
think
of
missing
you,
when
such
an
offer
as
this
comes
in
your
way.
I
could
do
very
well
without
you,
if
you
were
married
to
a
man
of
such
good
estate
as
Mr.
Crawford.
And
you
must
be
aware,
Fanny,
that
it
is
every
young
woman's
duty
to
accept
such
a
very
unexceptionable
offer
as
this."
This
was
almost
the
only
rule
of
conduct,
the
only
piece
of
advice,
which
Fanny
had
ever
received
from
her
aunt
in
the
course
of
eight
years
and
a
half.
It
silenced
her.
She
felt
how
unprofitable
contention
would
be.
If
her
aunt's
feelings
were
against
her,
nothing
could
be
hoped
from
attacking
her
understanding.
Lady
Bertram
was
quite
talkative.
"I
will
tell
you
what,
Fanny,"
said
she,
"I
am
sure
he
fell
in
love
with
you
at
the
ball;
I
am
sure
the
mischief
was
done
that
evening.
You
did
look
remarkably
well.
Everybody
said
so.
Sir
Thomas
said
so.
And
you
know
you
had
Chapman
to
help
you
to
dress.
I
am
very
glad
I
sent
Chapman
to
you.
I
shall
tell
Sir
Thomas
that
I
am
sure
it
was
done
that
evening."
And
still
pursuing
the
same
cheerful
thoughts,
she
soon
afterwards
added,
"And
will
tell
you
what,
Fanny,
which
is
more
than
I
did
for
Maria:
the
next
time
Pug
has
a
litter
you
shall
have
a
puppy."
Edmund
had
great
things
to
hear
on
his
return.
Many
surprises
were
awaiting
him.
The
first
that
occurred
was
not
least
in
interest:
the
appearance
of
Henry
Crawford
and
his
sister
walking
together
through
the
village
as
he
rode
into
it.
He
had
concluded
he
had
meant
them
to
be
far
distant.
His
absence
had
been
extended
beyond
a
fortnight
purposely
to
avoid
Miss
Crawford.
He
was
returning
to
Mansfield
with
spirits
ready
to
feed
on
melancholy
remembrances,
and
tender
associations,
when
her
own
fair
self
was
before
him,
leaning
on
her
brother's
arm,
and
he
found
himself
receiving
a
welcome,
unquestionably
friendly,
from
the
woman
whom,
two
moments
before,
he
had
been
thinking
of
as
seventy
miles
off,
and
as
farther,
much
farther,
from
him
in
inclination
than
any
distance
could
express.
Her
reception
of
him
was
of
a
sort
which
he
could
not
have
hoped
for,
had
he
expected
to
see
her.
Coming
as
he
did
from
such
a
purport
fulfilled
as
had
taken
him
away,
he
would
have
expected
anything
rather
than
a
look
of
satisfaction,
and
words
of
simple,
pleasant
meaning.
It
was
enough
to
set
his
heart
in
a
glow,
and
to
bring
him
home
in
the
properest
state
for
feeling
the
full
value
of
the
other
joyful
surprises
at
hand.
William's
promotion,
with
all
its
particulars,
he
was
soon
master
of;
and
with
such
a
secret
provision
of
comfort
within
his
own
breast
to
help
the
joy,
he
found
in
it
a
source
of
most
gratifying
sensation
and
unvarying
cheerfulness
all
dinner
time.
After
dinner,
when
he
and
his
father
were
alone,
he
had
Fanny's
history;
and
then
all
the
great
events
of
the
last
fortnight,
and
the
present
situation
of
matters
at
Mansfield
were
known
to
him.
Fanny
suspected
what
was
going
on.
They
sat
so
much
longer
than
usual
in
the
dining
parlour,
that
she
was
sure
they
must
be
talking
of
her;
and
when
tea
at
last
brought
them
away,
and
she
was
to
be
seen
by
Edmund
again,
she
felt
dreadfully
guilty.
He
came
to
her,
sat
down
by
her,
took
her
hand,
and
pressed
it
kindly;
and
at
that
moment
she
thought
that,
but
for
the
occupation
and
the
scene
which
the
tea
things
afforded,
she
must
have
betrayed
her
emotion
in
some
unpardonable
excess.
He
was
not
intending,
however,
by
such
action,
to
be
conveying
to
her
that
unqualified
approbation
and
encouragement
which
her
hopes
drew
from
it.
It
was
designed
only
to
express
his
participation
in
all
that
interested
her,
and
to
tell
her
that
he
had
been
hearing
what
quickened
every
feeling
of
affection.
He
was,
in
fact,
entirely
on
his
father's
side
of
the
question.
His
surprise
was
not
so
great
as
his
father's
at
her
refusing
Crawford,
because,
so
far
from
supposing
her
to
consider
him
with
anything
like
a
preference,
he
had
always
believed
it
to
be
rather
the
reverse,
and
could
imagine
her
to
be
taken
perfectly
unprepared,
but
Sir
Thomas
could
not
regard
the
connexion
as
more
desirable
than
he
did.
It
had
every
recommendation
to
him;
and
while
honouring
her
for
what
she
had
done
under
the
influence
of
her
present
indifference,
honouring
her
in
rather
stronger
terms
than
Sir
Thomas
could
quite
echo,
he
was
most
earnest
in
hoping,
and
sanguine
in
believing,
that
it
would
be
a
match
at
last,
and
that,
united
by
mutual
affection,
it
would
appear
that
their
dispositions
were
as
exactly
fitted
to
make
them
blessed
in
each
other,
as
he
was
now
beginning
seriously
to
consider
them.
Crawford
had
been
too
precipitate.
He
had
not
given
her
time
to
attach
herself.
He
had
begun
at
the
wrong
end.
With
such
powers
as
his,
however,
and
such
a
disposition
as
hers,
Edmund
trusted
that
everything
would
work
out
a
happy
conclusion.
Meanwhile,
he
saw
enough
of
Fanny's
embarrassment
to
make
him
scrupulously
guard
against
exciting
it
a
second
time,
by
any
word,
or
look,
or
movement.
Crawford
called
the
next
day,
and
on
the
score
of
Edmund's
return,
Sir
Thomas
felt
himself
more
than
licensed
to
ask
him
to
stay
dinner;
it
was
really
a
necessary
compliment.
He
staid
of
course,
and
Edmund
had
then
ample
opportunity
for
observing
how
he
sped
with
Fanny,
and
what
degree
of
immediate
encouragement
for
him
might
be
extracted
from
her
manners;
and
it
was
so
little,
so
very,
very
little
every
chance,
every
possibility
of
it,
resting
upon
her
embarrassment
only;
if
there
was
not
hope
in
her
confusion,
there
was
hope
in
nothing
else
that
he
was
almost
ready
to
wonder
at
his
friend's
perseverance.
Fanny
was
worth
it
all;
he
held
her
to
be
worth
every
effort
of
patience,
every
exertion
of
mind,
but
he
did
not
think
he
could
have
gone
on
himself
with
any
woman
breathing,
without
something
more
to
warm
his
courage
than
his
eyes
could
discern
in
hers.
He
was
very
willing
to
hope
that
Crawford
saw
clearer,
and
this
was
the
most
comfortable
conclusion
for
his
friend
that
he
could
come
to
from
all
that
he
observed
to
pass
before,
and
at,
and
after
dinner.
In
the
evening
a
few
circumstances
occurred
which
he
thought
more
promising.
When
he
and
Crawford
walked
into
the
drawing
room,
his
mother
and
Fanny
were
sitting
as
intently
and
silently
at
work
as
if
there
were
nothing
else
to
care
for.
Edmund
could
not
help
noticing
their
apparently
deep
tranquillity.
"We
have
not
been
so
silent
all
the
time,"
replied
his
mother.
"Fanny
has
been
reading
to
me,
and
only
put
the
book
down
upon
hearing
you
coming."
And
sure
enough
there
was
a
book
on
the
table
which
had
the
air
of
being
very
recently
closed:
a
volume
of
Shakespeare.
"She
often
reads
to
me
out
of
those
books;
and
she
was
in
the
middle
of
a
very
fine
speech
of
that
man's
what's
his
name,
Fanny?
when
we
heard
your
footsteps."
Crawford
took
the
volume.
"Let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
finishing
that
speech
to
your
ladyship,"
said
he.
"I
shall
find
it
immediately."
And
by
carefully
giving
way
to
the
inclination
of
the
leaves,
he
did
find
it,
or
within
a
page
or
two,
quite
near
enough
to
satisfy
Lady
Bertram,
who
assured
him,
as
soon
as
he
mentioned
the
name
of
Cardinal
Wolsey,
that
he
had
got
the
very
speech.
Not
a
look
or
an
offer
of
help
had
Fanny
given;
not
a
syllable
for
or
against.
All
her
attention
was
for
her
work.
She
seemed
determined
to
be
interested
by
nothing
else.
But
taste
was
too
strong
in
her.
She
could
not
abstract
her
mind
five
minutes:
she
was
forced
to
listen;
his
reading
was
capital,
and
her
pleasure
in
good
reading
extreme.
To
good
reading,
however,
she
had
been
long
used:
her
uncle
read
well,
her
cousins
all,
Edmund
very
well,
but
in
Mr.
Crawford's
reading
there
was
a
variety
of
excellence
beyond
what
she
had
ever
met
with.
The
King,
the
Queen,
Buckingham,
Wolsey,
Cromwell,
all
were
given
in
turn;
for
with
the
happiest
knack,
the
happiest
power
of
jumping
and
guessing,
he
could
always
alight
at
will
on
the
best
scene,
or
the
best
speeches
of
each;
and
whether
it
were
dignity,
or
pride,
or
tenderness,
or
remorse,
or
whatever
were
to
be
expressed,
he
could
do
it
with
equal
beauty.
It
was
truly
dramatic.
His
acting
had
first
taught
Fanny
what
pleasure
a
play
might
give,
and
his
reading
brought
all
his
acting
before
her
again;
nay,
perhaps
with
greater
enjoyment,
for
it
came
unexpectedly,
and
with
no
such
drawback
as
she
had
been
used
to
suffer
in
seeing
him
on
the
stage
with
Miss
Bertram.
Edmund
watched
the
progress
of
her
attention,
and
was
amused
and
gratified
by
seeing
how
she
gradually
slackened
in
the
needlework,
which
at
the
beginning
seemed
to
occupy
her
totally:
how
it
fell
from
her
hand
while
she
sat
motionless
over
it,
and
at
last,
how
the
eyes
which
had
appeared
so
studiously
to
avoid
him
throughout
the
day
were
turned
and
fixed
on
Crawford
fixed
on
him
for
minutes,
fixed
on
him,
in
short,
till
the
attraction
drew
Crawford's
upon
her,
and
the
book
was
closed,
and
the
charm
was
broken.
Then
she
was
shrinking
again
into
herself,
and
blushing
and
working
as
hard
as
ever;
but
it
had
been
enough
to
give
Edmund
encouragement
for
his
friend,
and
as
he
cordially
thanked
him,
he
hoped
to
be
expressing
Fanny's
secret
feelings
too.
"That
play
must
be
a
favourite
with
you,"
said
he;
"you
read
as
if
you
knew
it
well."
"It
will
be
a
favourite,
I
believe,
from
this
hour,"
replied
Crawford;
"but
I
do
not
think
I
have
had
a
volume
of
Shakespeare
in
my
hand
before
since
I
was
fifteen.
I
once
saw
Henry
the
Eighth
acted,
or
I
have
heard
of
it
from
somebody
who
did,
I
am
not
certain
which.
But
Shakespeare
one
gets
acquainted
with
without
knowing
how.
It
is
a
part
of
an
Englishman's
constitution.
His
thoughts
and
beauties
are
so
spread
abroad
that
one
touches
them
everywhere;
one
is
intimate
with
him
by
instinct.
No
man
of
any
brain
can
open
at
a
good
part
of
one
of
his
plays
without
falling
into
the
flow
of
his
meaning
immediately."
"No
doubt
one
is
familiar
with
Shakespeare
in
a
degree,"
said
Edmund,
"from
one's
earliest
years.
His
celebrated
passages
are
quoted
by
everybody;
they
are
in
half
the
books
we
open,
and
we
all
talk
Shakespeare,
use
his
similes,
and
describe
with
his
descriptions;
but
this
is
totally
distinct
from
giving
his
sense
as
you
gave
it.
To
know
him
in
bits
and
scraps
is
common
enough;
to
know
him
pretty
thoroughly
is,
perhaps,
not
uncommon;
but
to
read
him
well
aloud
is
no
everyday
talent."
"Sir,
you
do
me
honour,"
was
Crawford's
answer,
with
a
bow
of
mock
gravity.
Both
gentlemen
had
a
glance
at
Fanny,
to
see
if
a
word
of
accordant
praise
could
be
extorted
from
her;
yet
both
feeling
that
it
could
not
be.
Her
praise
had
been
given
in
her
attention;
that
must
content
them.
Lady
Bertram's
admiration
was
expressed,
and
strongly
too.
"It
was
really
like
being
at
a
play,"
said
she.
"I
wish
Sir
Thomas
had
been
here."
Crawford
was
excessively
pleased.
If
Lady
Bertram,
with
all
her
incompetency
and
languor,
could
feel
this,
the
inference
of
what
her
niece,
alive
and
enlightened
as
she
was,
must
feel,
was
elevating.
"You
have
a
great
turn
for
acting,
I
am
sure,
Mr.
Crawford,"
said
her
ladyship
soon
afterwards;
"and
I
will
tell
you
what,
I
think
you
will
have
a
theatre,
some
time
or
other,
at
your
house
in
Norfolk.
I
mean
when
you
are
settled
there.
I
do
indeed.
I
think
you
will
fit
up
a
theatre
at
your
house
in
Norfolk."
"Do
you,
ma'am?"
cried
he,
with
quickness.
"No,
no,
that
will
never
be.
Your
ladyship
is
quite
mistaken.
No
theatre
at
Everingham!
Oh
no!"
And
he
looked
at
Fanny
with
an
expressive
smile,
which
evidently
meant,
"That
lady
will
never
allow
a
theatre
at
Everingham."
Edmund
saw
it
all,
and
saw
Fanny
so
determined
not
to
see
it,
as
to
make
it
clear
that
the
voice
was
enough
to
convey
the
full
meaning
of
the
protestation;
and
such
a
quick
consciousness
of
compliment,
such
a
ready
comprehension
of
a
hint,
he
thought,
was
rather
favourable
than
not.
The
subject
of
reading
aloud
was
farther
discussed.
The
two
young
men
were
the
only
talkers,
but
they,
standing
by
the
fire,
talked
over
the
too
common
neglect
of
the
qualification,
the
total
inattention
to
it,
in
the
ordinary
school
system
for
boys,
the
consequently
natural,
yet
in
some
instances
almost
unnatural,
degree
of
ignorance
and
uncouthness
of
men,
of
sensible
and
well
informed
men,
when
suddenly
called
to
the
necessity
of
reading
aloud,
which
had
fallen
within
their
notice,
giving
instances
of
blunders,
and
failures
with
their
secondary
causes,
the
want
of
management
of
the
voice,
of
proper
modulation
and
emphasis,
of
foresight
and
judgment,
all
proceeding
from
the
first
cause:
want
of
early
attention
and
habit;
and
Fanny
was
listening
again
with
great
entertainment.
"Even
in
my
profession,"
said
Edmund,
with
a
smile,
"how
little
the
art
of
reading
has
been
studied!
how
little
a
clear
manner,
and
good
delivery,
have
been
attended
to!
I
speak
rather
of
the
past,
however,
than
the
present.
There
is
now
a
spirit
of
improvement
abroad;
but
among
those
who
were
ordained
twenty,
thirty,
forty
years
ago,
the
larger
number,
to
judge
by
their
performance,
must
have
thought
reading
was
reading,
and
preaching
was
preaching.
It
is
different
now.
The
subject
is
more
justly
considered.
It
is
felt
that
distinctness
and
energy
may
have
weight
in
recommending
the
most
solid
truths;
and
besides,
there
is
more
general
observation
and
taste,
a
more
critical
knowledge
diffused
than
formerly;
in
every
congregation
there
is
a
larger
proportion
who
know
a
little
of
the
matter,
and
who
can
judge
and
criticise."
Edmund
had
already
gone
through
the
service
once
since
his
ordination;
and
upon
this
being
understood,
he
had
a
variety
of
questions
from
Crawford
as
to
his
feelings
and
success;
questions,
which
being
made,
though
with
the
vivacity
of
friendly
interest
and
quick
taste,
without
any
touch
of
that
spirit
of
banter
or
air
of
levity
which
Edmund
knew
to
be
most
offensive
to
Fanny,
he
had
true
pleasure
in
satisfying;
and
when
Crawford
proceeded
to
ask
his
opinion
and
give
his
own
as
to
the
properest
manner
in
which
particular
passages
in
the
service
should
be
delivered,
shewing
it
to
be
a
subject
on
which
he
had
thought
before,
and
thought
with
judgment,
Edmund
was
still
more
and
more
pleased.
This
would
be
the
way
to
Fanny's
heart.
She
was
not
to
be
won
by
all
that
gallantry
and
wit
and
good
nature
together
could
do;
or,
at
least,
she
would
not
be
won
by
them
nearly
so
soon,
without
the
assistance
of
sentiment
and
feeling,
and
seriousness
on
serious
subjects.
"Our
liturgy,"
observed
Crawford,
"has
beauties,
which
not
even
a
careless,
slovenly
style
of
reading
can
destroy;
but
it
has
also
redundancies
and
repetitions
which
require
good
reading
not
to
be
felt.
For
myself,
at
least,
I
must
confess
being
not
always
so
attentive
as
I
ought
to
be"
(here
was
a
glance
at
Fanny);
"that
nineteen
times
out
of
twenty
I
am
thinking
how
such
a
prayer
ought
to
be
read,
and
longing
to
have
it
to
read
myself.
Did
you
speak?"
stepping
eagerly
to
Fanny,
and
addressing
her
in
a
softened
voice;
and
upon
her
saying
"No,"
he
added,
"Are
you
sure
you
did
not
speak?
I
saw
your
lips
move.
I
fancied
you
might
be
going
to
tell
me
I
ought
to
be
more
attentive,
and
not
allow
my
thoughts
to
wander.
Are
not
you
going
to
tell
me
so?"
"No,
indeed,
you
know
your
duty
too
well
for
me
to
even
supposing
"
She
stopt,
felt
herself
getting
into
a
puzzle,
and
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
add
another
word,
not
by
dint
of
several
minutes
of
supplication
and
waiting.
He
then
returned
to
his
former
station,
and
went
on
as
if
there
had
been
no
such
tender
interruption.
"A
sermon,
well
delivered,
is
more
uncommon
even
than
prayers
well
read.
A
sermon,
good
in
itself,
is
no
rare
thing.
It
is
more
difficult
to
speak
well
than
to
compose
well;
that
is,
the
rules
and
trick
of
composition
are
oftener
an
object
of
study.
A
thoroughly
good
sermon,
thoroughly
well
delivered,
is
a
capital
gratification.
I
can
never
hear
such
a
one
without
the
greatest
admiration
and
respect,
and
more
than
half
a
mind
to
take
orders
and
preach
myself.
There
is
something
in
the
eloquence
of
the
pulpit,
when
it
is
really
eloquence,
which
is
entitled
to
the
highest
praise
and
honour.
The
preacher
who
can
touch
and
affect
such
an
heterogeneous
mass
of
hearers,
on
subjects
limited,
and
long
worn
threadbare
in
all
common
hands;
who
can
say
anything
new
or
striking,
anything
that
rouses
the
attention
without
offending
the
taste,
or
wearing
out
the
feelings
of
his
hearers,
is
a
man
whom
one
could
not,
in
his
public
capacity,
honour
enough.
I
should
like
to
be
such
a
man."
Edmund
laughed.
"I
should
indeed.
I
never
listened
to
a
distinguished
preacher
in
my
life
without
a
sort
of
envy.
But
then,
I
must
have
a
London
audience.
I
could
not
preach
but
to
the
educated;
to
those
who
were
capable
of
estimating
my
composition.
And
I
do
not
know
that
I
should
be
fond
of
preaching
often;
now
and
then,
perhaps
once
or
twice
in
the
spring,
after
being
anxiously
expected
for
half
a
dozen
Sundays
together;
but
not
for
a
constancy;
it
would
not
do
for
a
constancy."
Here
Fanny,
who
could
not
but
listen,
involuntarily
shook
her
head,
and
Crawford
was
instantly
by
her
side
again,
entreating
to
know
her
meaning;
and
as
Edmund
perceived,
by
his
drawing
in
a
chair,
and
sitting
down
close
by
her,
that
it
was
to
be
a
very
thorough
attack,
that
looks
and
undertones
were
to
be
well
tried,
he
sank
as
quietly
as
possible
into
a
corner,
turned
his
back,
and
took
up
a
newspaper,
very
sincerely
wishing
that
dear
little
Fanny
might
be
persuaded
into
explaining
away
that
shake
of
the
head
to
the
satisfaction
of
her
ardent
lover;
and
as
earnestly
trying
to
bury
every
sound
of
the
business
from
himself
in
murmurs
of
his
own,
over
the
various
advertisements
of
"A
most
desirable
Estate
in
South
Wales";
"To
Parents
and
Guardians";
and
a
"Capital
season'd
Hunter."
Fanny,
meanwhile,
vexed
with
herself
for
not
having
been
as
motionless
as
she
was
speechless,
and
grieved
to
the
heart
to
see
Edmund's
arrangements,
was
trying
by
everything
in
the
power
of
her
modest,
gentle
nature,
to
repulse
Mr.
Crawford,
and
avoid
both
his
looks
and
inquiries;
and
he,
unrepulsable,
was
persisting
in
both.
"What
did
that
shake
of
the
head
mean?"
said
he.
"What
was
it
meant
to
express?
Disapprobation,
I
fear.
But
of
what?
What
had
I
been
saying
to
displease
you?
Did
you
think
me
speaking
improperly,
lightly,
irreverently
on
the
subject?
Only
tell
me
if
I
was.
Only
tell
me
if
I
was
wrong.
I
want
to
be
set
right.
Nay,
nay,
I
entreat
you;
for
one
moment
put
down
your
work.
What
did
that
shake
of
the
head
mean?"
In
vain
was
her
"Pray,
sir,
don't;
pray,
Mr.
Crawford,"
repeated
twice
over;
and
in
vain
did
she
try
to
move
away.
In
the
same
low,
eager
voice,
and
the
same
close
neighbourhood,
he
went
on,
reurging
the
same
questions
as
before.
She
grew
more
agitated
and
displeased.
"How
can
you,
sir?
You
quite
astonish
me;
I
wonder
how
you
can
"
"Do
I
astonish
you?"
said
he.
"Do
you
wonder?
Is
there
anything
in
my
present
entreaty
that
you
do
not
understand?
I
will
explain
to
you
instantly
all
that
makes
me
urge
you
in
this
manner,
all
that
gives
me
an
interest
in
what
you
look
and
do,
and
excites
my
present
curiosity.
I
will
not
leave
you
to
wonder
long."
In
spite
of
herself,
she
could
not
help
half
a
smile,
but
she
said
nothing.
"You
shook
your
head
at
my
acknowledging
that
I
should
not
like
to
engage
in
the
duties
of
a
clergyman
always
for
a
constancy.
Yes,
that
was
the
word.
Constancy:
I
am
not
afraid
of
the
word.
I
would
spell
it,
read
it,
write
it
with
anybody.
I
see
nothing
alarming
in
the
word.
Did
you
think
I
ought?"
"Perhaps,
sir,"
said
Fanny,
wearied
at
last
into
speaking
"perhaps,
sir,
I
thought
it
was
a
pity
you
did
not
always
know
yourself
as
well
as
you
seemed
to
do
at
that
moment."
Crawford,
delighted
to
get
her
to
speak
at
any
rate,
was
determined
to
keep
it
up;
and
poor
Fanny,
who
had
hoped
to
silence
him
by
such
an
extremity
of
reproof,
found
herself
sadly
mistaken,
and
that
it
was
only
a
change
from
one
object
of
curiosity
and
one
set
of
words
to
another.
He
had
always
something
to
entreat
the
explanation
of.
The
opportunity
was
too
fair.
None
such
had
occurred
since
his
seeing
her
in
her
uncle's
room,
none
such
might
occur
again
before
his
leaving
Mansfield.
Lady
Bertram's
being
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
was
a
trifle,
for
she
might
always
be
considered
as
only
half
awake,
and
Edmund's
advertisements
were
still
of
the
first
utility.
"Well,"
said
Crawford,
after
a
course
of
rapid
questions
and
reluctant
answers;
"I
am
happier
than
I
was,
because
I
now
understand
more
clearly
your
opinion
of
me.
You
think
me
unsteady:
easily
swayed
by
the
whim
of
the
moment,
easily
tempted,
easily
put
aside.
With
such
an
opinion,
no
wonder
that.
But
we
shall
see.
It
is
not
by
protestations
that
I
shall
endeavour
to
convince
you
I
am
wronged;
it
is
not
by
telling
you
that
my
affections
are
steady.
My
conduct
shall
speak
for
me;
absence,
distance,
time
shall
speak
for
me.
They
shall
prove
that,
as
far
as
you
can
be
deserved
by
anybody,
I
do
deserve
you.
You
are
infinitely
my
superior
in
merit;
all
that
I
know.
You
have
qualities
which
I
had
not
before
supposed
to
exist
in
such
a
degree
in
any
human
creature.
You
have
some
touches
of
the
angel
in
you
beyond
what
not
merely
beyond
what
one
sees,
because
one
never
sees
anything
like
it
but
beyond
what
one
fancies
might
be.
But
still
I
am
not
frightened.
It
is
not
by
equality
of
merit
that
you
can
be
won.
That
is
out
of
the
question.
It
is
he
who
sees
and
worships
your
merit
the
strongest,
who
loves
you
most
devotedly,
that
has
the
best
right
to
a
return.
There
I
build
my
confidence.
By
that
right
I
do
and
will
deserve
you;
and
when
once
convinced
that
my
attachment
is
what
I
declare
it,
I
know
you
too
well
not
to
entertain
the
warmest
hopes.
Yes,
dearest,
sweetest
Fanny.
Nay"
(seeing
her
draw
back
displeased),
"forgive
me.
Perhaps
I
have
as
yet
no
right;
but
by
what
other
name
can
I
call
you?
Do
you
suppose
you
are
ever
present
to
my
imagination
under
any
other?
No,
it
is
'Fanny'
that
I
think
of
all
day,
and
dream
of
all
night.
You
have
given
the
name
such
reality
of
sweetness,
that
nothing
else
can
now
be
descriptive
of
you."
Fanny
could
hardly
have
kept
her
seat
any
longer,
or
have
refrained
from
at
least
trying
to
get
away
in
spite
of
all
the
too
public
opposition
she
foresaw
to
it,
had
it
not
been
for
the
sound
of
approaching
relief,
the
very
sound
which
she
had
been
long
watching
for,
and
long
thinking
strangely
delayed.
The
solemn
procession,
headed
by
Baddeley,
of
tea
board,
urn,
and
cake
bearers,
made
its
appearance,
and
delivered
her
from
a
grievous
imprisonment
of
body
and
mind.
Mr.
Crawford
was
obliged
to
move.
She
was
at
liberty,
she
was
busy,
she
was
protected.
Edmund
was
not
sorry
to
be
admitted
again
among
the
number
of
those
who
might
speak
and
hear.
But
though
the
conference
had
seemed
full
long
to
him,
and
though
on
looking
at
Fanny
he
saw
rather
a
flush
of
vexation,
he
inclined
to
hope
that
so
much
could
not
have
been
said
and
listened
to
without
some
profit
to
the
speaker.
Edmund
had
determined
that
it
belonged
entirely
to
Fanny
to
chuse
whether
her
situation
with
regard
to
Crawford
should
be
mentioned
between
them
or
not;
and
that
if
she
did
not
lead
the
way,
it
should
never
be
touched
on
by
him;
but
after
a
day
or
two
of
mutual
reserve,
he
was
induced
by
his
father
to
change
his
mind,
and
try
what
his
influence
might
do
for
his
friend.
A
day,
and
a
very
early
day,
was
actually
fixed
for
the
Crawfords'
departure;
and
Sir
Thomas
thought
it
might
be
as
well
to
make
one
more
effort
for
the
young
man
before
he
left
Mansfield,
that
all
his
professions
and
vows
of
unshaken
attachment
might
have
as
much
hope
to
sustain
them
as
possible.
Sir
Thomas
was
most
cordially
anxious
for
the
perfection
of
Mr.
Crawford's
character
in
that
point.
He
wished
him
to
be
a
model
of
constancy;
and
fancied
the
best
means
of
effecting
it
would
be
by
not
trying
him
too
long.
Edmund
was
not
unwilling
to
be
persuaded
to
engage
in
the
business;
he
wanted
to
know
Fanny's
feelings.
She
had
been
used
to
consult
him
in
every
difficulty,
and
he
loved
her
too
well
to
bear
to
be
denied
her
confidence
now;
he
hoped
to
be
of
service
to
her,
he
thought
he
must
be
of
service
to
her;
whom
else
had
she
to
open
her
heart
to?
If
she
did
not
need
counsel,
she
must
need
the
comfort
of
communication.
Fanny
estranged
from
him,
silent
and
reserved,
was
an
unnatural
state
of
things;
a
state
which
he
must
break
through,
and
which
he
could
easily
learn
to
think
she
was
wanting
him
to
break
through.
"I
will
speak
to
her,
sir:
I
will
take
the
first
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
alone,"
was
the
result
of
such
thoughts
as
these;
and
upon
Sir
Thomas's
information
of
her
being
at
that
very
time
walking
alone
in
the
shrubbery,
he
instantly
joined
her.
"I
am
come
to
walk
with
you,
Fanny,"
said
he.
"Shall
I?"
Drawing
her
arm
within
his.
"It
is
a
long
while
since
we
have
had
a
comfortable
walk
together."
She
assented
to
it
all
rather
by
look
than
word.
Her
spirits
were
low.
"But,
Fanny,"
he
presently
added,
"in
order
to
have
a
comfortable
walk,
something
more
is
necessary
than
merely
pacing
this
gravel
together.
You
must
talk
to
me.
I
know
you
have
something
on
your
mind.
I
know
what
you
are
thinking
of.
You
cannot
suppose
me
uninformed.
Am
I
to
hear
of
it
from
everybody
but
Fanny
herself?"
Fanny,
at
once
agitated
and
dejected,
replied,
"If
you
hear
of
it
from
everybody,
cousin,
there
can
be
nothing
for
me
to
tell."
"Not
of
facts,
perhaps;
but
of
feelings,
Fanny.
No
one
but
you
can
tell
me
them.
I
do
not
mean
to
press
you,
however.
If
it
is
not
what
you
wish
yourself,
I
have
done.
I
had
thought
it
might
be
a
relief."
"I
am
afraid
we
think
too
differently
for
me
to
find
any
relief
in
talking
of
what
I
feel."
"Do
you
suppose
that
we
think
differently?
I
have
no
idea
of
it.
I
dare
say
that,
on
a
comparison
of
our
opinions,
they
would
be
found
as
much
alike
as
they
have
been
used
to
be:
to
the
point
I
consider
Crawford's
proposals
as
most
advantageous
and
desirable,
if
you
could
return
his
affection.
I
consider
it
as
most
natural
that
all
your
family
should
wish
you
could
return
it;
but
that,
as
you
cannot,
you
have
done
exactly
as
you
ought
in
refusing
him.
Can
there
be
any
disagreement
between
us
here?"
"Oh
no!
But
I
thought
you
blamed
me.
I
thought
you
were
against
me.
This
is
such
a
comfort!"
"This
comfort
you
might
have
had
sooner,
Fanny,
had
you
sought
it.
But
how
could
you
possibly
suppose
me
against
you?
How
could
you
imagine
me
an
advocate
for
marriage
without
love?
Were
I
even
careless
in
general
on
such
matters,
how
could
you
imagine
me
so
where
your
happiness
was
at
stake?"
"My
uncle
thought
me
wrong,
and
I
knew
he
had
been
talking
to
you."
"As
far
as
you
have
gone,
Fanny,
I
think
you
perfectly
right.
I
may
be
sorry,
I
may
be
surprised
though
hardly
that,
for
you
had
not
had
time
to
attach
yourself
but
I
think
you
perfectly
right.
Can
it
admit
of
a
question?
It
is
disgraceful
to
us
if
it
does.
You
did
not
love
him;
nothing
could
have
justified
your
accepting
him."
Fanny
had
not
felt
so
comfortable
for
days
and
days.
"So
far
your
conduct
has
been
faultless,
and
they
were
quite
mistaken
who
wished
you
to
do
otherwise.
But
the
matter
does
not
end
here.
Crawford's
is
no
common
attachment;
he
perseveres,
with
the
hope
of
creating
that
regard
which
had
not
been
created
before.
This,
we
know,
must
be
a
work
of
time.
But"
(with
an
affectionate
smile)
"let
him
succeed
at
last,
Fanny,
let
him
succeed
at
last.
You
have
proved
yourself
upright
and
disinterested,
prove
yourself
grateful
and
tender
hearted;
and
then
you
will
be
the
perfect
model
of
a
woman
which
I
have
always
believed
you
born
for."
"Oh!
never,
never,
never!
he
never
will
succeed
with
me."
And
she
spoke
with
a
warmth
which
quite
astonished
Edmund,
and
which
she
blushed
at
the
recollection
of
herself,
when
she
saw
his
look,
and
heard
him
reply,
"Never!
Fanny!
so
very
determined
and
positive!
This
is
not
like
yourself,
your
rational
self."
"I
mean,"
she
cried,
sorrowfully
correcting
herself,
"that
I
think
I
never
shall,
as
far
as
the
future
can
be
answered
for;
I
think
I
never
shall
return
his
regard."
"I
must
hope
better
things.
I
am
aware,
more
aware
than
Crawford
can
be,
that
the
man
who
means
to
make
you
love
him
(you
having
due
notice
of
his
intentions)
must
have
very
uphill
work,
for
there
are
all
your
early
attachments
and
habits
in
battle
array;
and
before
he
can
get
your
heart
for
his
own
use
he
has
to
unfasten
it
from
all
the
holds
upon
things
animate
and
inanimate,
which
so
many
years'
growth
have
confirmed,
and
which
are
considerably
tightened
for
the
moment
by
the
very
idea
of
separation.
I
know
that
the
apprehension
of
being
forced
to
quit
Mansfield
will
for
a
time
be
arming
you
against
him.
I
wish
he
had
not
been
obliged
to
tell
you
what
he
was
trying
for.
I
wish
he
had
known
you
as
well
as
I
do,
Fanny.
Between
us,
I
think
we
should
have
won
you.
My
theoretical
and
his
practical
knowledge
together
could
not
have
failed.
He
should
have
worked
upon
my
plans.
I
must
hope,
however,
that
time,
proving
him
(as
I
firmly
believe
it
will)
to
deserve
you
by
his
steady
affection,
will
give
him
his
reward.
I
cannot
suppose
that
you
have
not
the
wish
to
love
him
the
natural
wish
of
gratitude.
You
must
have
some
feeling
of
that
sort.
You
must
be
sorry
for
your
own
indifference."
"We
are
so
totally
unlike,"
said
Fanny,
avoiding
a
direct
answer,
"we
are
so
very,
very
different
in
all
our
inclinations
and
ways,
that
I
consider
it
as
quite
impossible
we
should
ever
be
tolerably
happy
together,
even
if
I
could
like
him.
There
never
were
two
people
more
dissimilar.
We
have
not
one
taste
in
common.
We
should
be
miserable."
"You
are
mistaken,
Fanny.
The
dissimilarity
is
not
so
strong.
You
are
quite
enough
alike.
You
have
tastes
in
common.
You
have
moral
and
literary
tastes
in
common.
You
have
both
warm
hearts
and
benevolent
feelings;
and,
Fanny,
who
that
heard
him
read,
and
saw
you
listen
to
Shakespeare
the
other
night,
will
think
you
unfitted
as
companions?
You
forget
yourself:
there
is
a
decided
difference
in
your
tempers,
I
allow.
He
is
lively,
you
are
serious;
but
so
much
the
better:
his
spirits
will
support
yours.
It
is
your
disposition
to
be
easily
dejected
and
to
fancy
difficulties
greater
than
they
are.
His
cheerfulness
will
counteract
this.
He
sees
difficulties
nowhere:
and
his
pleasantness
and
gaiety
will
be
a
constant
support
to
you.
Your
being
so
far
unlike,
Fanny,
does
not
in
the
smallest
degree
make
against
the
probability
of
your
happiness
together:
do
not
imagine
it.
I
am
myself
convinced
that
it
is
rather
a
favourable
circumstance.
I
am
perfectly
persuaded
that
the
tempers
had
better
be
unlike:
I
mean
unlike
in
the
flow
of
the
spirits,
in
the
manners,
in
the
inclination
for
much
or
little
company,
in
the
propensity
to
talk
or
to
be
silent,
to
be
grave
or
to
be
gay.
Some
opposition
here
is,
I
am
thoroughly
convinced,
friendly
to
matrimonial
happiness.
I
exclude
extremes,
of
course;
and
a
very
close
resemblance
in
all
those
points
would
be
the
likeliest
way
to
produce
an
extreme.
A
counteraction,
gentle
and
continual,
is
the
best
safeguard
of
manners
and
conduct."
Full
well
could
Fanny
guess
where
his
thoughts
were
now:
Miss
Crawford's
power
was
all
returning.
He
had
been
speaking
of
her
cheerfully
from
the
hour
of
his
coming
home.
His
avoiding
her
was
quite
at
an
end.
He
had
dined
at
the
Parsonage
only
the
preceding
day.
After
leaving
him
to
his
happier
thoughts
for
some
minutes,
Fanny,
feeling
it
due
to
herself,
returned
to
Mr.
Crawford,
and
said,
"It
is
not
merely
in
temper
that
I
consider
him
as
totally
unsuited
to
myself;
though,
in
that
respect,
I
think
the
difference
between
us
too
great,
infinitely
too
great:
his
spirits
often
oppress
me;
but
there
is
something
in
him
which
I
object
to
still
more.
I
must
say,
cousin,
that
I
cannot
approve
his
character.
I
have
not
thought
well
of
him
from
the
time
of
the
play.
I
then
saw
him
behaving,
as
it
appeared
to
me,
so
very
improperly
and
unfeelingly
I
may
speak
of
it
now
because
it
is
all
over
so
improperly
by
poor
Mr.
Rushworth,
not
seeming
to
care
how
he
exposed
or
hurt
him,
and
paying
attentions
to
my
cousin
Maria,
which
in
short,
at
the
time
of
the
play,
I
received
an
impression
which
will
never
be
got
over."
"My
dear
Fanny,"
replied
Edmund,
scarcely
hearing
her
to
the
end,
"let
us
not,
any
of
us,
be
judged
by
what
we
appeared
at
that
period
of
general
folly.
The
time
of
the
play
is
a
time
which
I
hate
to
recollect.
Maria
was
wrong,
Crawford
was
wrong,
we
were
all
wrong
together;
but
none
so
wrong
as
myself.
Compared
with
me,
all
the
rest
were
blameless.
I
was
playing
the
fool
with
my
eyes
open."
"As
a
bystander,"
said
Fanny,
"perhaps
I
saw
more
than
you
did;
and
I
do
think
that
Mr.
Rushworth
was
sometimes
very
jealous."
"Very
possibly.
No
wonder.
Nothing
could
be
more
improper
than
the
whole
business.
I
am
shocked
whenever
I
think
that
Maria
could
be
capable
of
it;
but,
if
she
could
undertake
the
part,
we
must
not
be
surprised
at
the
rest."
"Before
the
play,
I
am
much
mistaken
if
Julia
did
not
think
he
was
paying
her
attentions."
"Julia!
I
have
heard
before
from
some
one
of
his
being
in
love
with
Julia;
but
I
could
never
see
anything
of
it.
And,
Fanny,
though
I
hope
I
do
justice
to
my
sisters'
good
qualities,
I
think
it
very
possible
that
they
might,
one
or
both,
be
more
desirous
of
being
admired
by
Crawford,
and
might
shew
that
desire
rather
more
unguardedly
than
was
perfectly
prudent.
I
can
remember
that
they
were
evidently
fond
of
his
society;
and
with
such
encouragement,
a
man
like
Crawford,
lively,
and
it
may
be,
a
little
unthinking,
might
be
led
on
to
there
could
be
nothing
very
striking,
because
it
is
clear
that
he
had
no
pretensions:
his
heart
was
reserved
for
you.
And
I
must
say,
that
its
being
for
you
has
raised
him
inconceivably
in
my
opinion.
It
does
him
the
highest
honour;
it
shews
his
proper
estimation
of
the
blessing
of
domestic
happiness
and
pure
attachment.
It
proves
him
unspoilt
by
his
uncle.
It
proves
him,
in
short,
everything
that
I
had
been
used
to
wish
to
believe
him,
and
feared
he
was
not."
"I
am
persuaded
that
he
does
not
think,
as
he
ought,
on
serious
subjects."
"Say,
rather,
that
he
has
not
thought
at
all
upon
serious
subjects,
which
I
believe
to
be
a
good
deal
the
case.
How
could
it
be
otherwise,
with
such
an
education
and
adviser?
Under
the
disadvantages,
indeed,
which
both
have
had,
is
it
not
wonderful
that
they
should
be
what
they
are?
Crawford's
feelings,
I
am
ready
to
acknowledge,
have
hitherto
been
too
much
his
guides.
Happily,
those
feelings
have
generally
been
good.
You
will
supply
the
rest;
and
a
most
fortunate
man
he
is
to
attach
himself
to
such
a
creature
to
a
woman
who,
firm
as
a
rock
in
her
own
principles,
has
a
gentleness
of
character
so
well
adapted
to
recommend
them.
He
has
chosen
his
partner,
indeed,
with
rare
felicity.
He
will
make
you
happy,
Fanny;
I
know
he
will
make
you
happy;
but
you
will
make
him
everything."
"I
would
not
engage
in
such
a
charge,"
cried
Fanny,
in
a
shrinking
accent;
"in
such
an
office
of
high
responsibility!"
"As
usual,
believing
yourself
unequal
to
anything!
fancying
everything
too
much
for
you!
Well,
though
I
may
not
be
able
to
persuade
you
into
different
feelings,
you
will
be
persuaded
into
them,
I
trust.
I
confess
myself
sincerely
anxious
that
you
may.
I
have
no
common
interest
in
Crawford's
well
doing.
Next
to
your
happiness,
Fanny,
his
has
the
first
claim
on
me.
You
are
aware
of
my
having
no
common
interest
in
Crawford."
Fanny
was
too
well
aware
of
it
to
have
anything
to
say;
and
they
walked
on
together
some
fifty
yards
in
mutual
silence
and
abstraction.
Edmund
first
began
again
"I
was
very
much
pleased
by
her
manner
of
speaking
of
it
yesterday,
particularly
pleased,
because
I
had
not
depended
upon
her
seeing
everything
in
so
just
a
light.
I
knew
she
was
very
fond
of
you;
but
yet
I
was
afraid
of
her
not
estimating
your
worth
to
her
brother
quite
as
it
deserved,
and
of
her
regretting
that
he
had
not
rather
fixed
on
some
woman
of
distinction
or
fortune.
I
was
afraid
of
the
bias
of
those
worldly
maxims,
which
she
has
been
too
much
used
to
hear.
But
it
was
very
different.
She
spoke
of
you,
Fanny,
just
as
she
ought.
She
desires
the
connexion
as
warmly
as
your
uncle
or
myself.
We
had
a
long
talk
about
it.
I
should
not
have
mentioned
the
subject,
though
very
anxious
to
know
her
sentiments;
but
I
had
not
been
in
the
room
five
minutes
before
she
began
introducing
it
with
all
that
openness
of
heart,
and
sweet
peculiarity
of
manner,
that
spirit
and
ingenuousness
which
are
so
much
a
part
of
herself.
Mrs.
Grant
laughed
at
her
for
her
rapidity."
"Was
Mrs.
Grant
in
the
room,
then?"
"Yes,
when
I
reached
the
house
I
found
the
two
sisters
together
by
themselves;
and
when
once
we
had
begun,
we
had
not
done
with
you,
Fanny,
till
Crawford
and
Dr.
Grant
came
in."
"It
is
above
a
week
since
I
saw
Miss
Crawford."
"Yes,
she
laments
it;
yet
owns
it
may
have
been
best.
You
will
see
her,
however,
before
she
goes.
She
is
very
angry
with
you,
Fanny;
you
must
be
prepared
for
that.
She
calls
herself
very
angry,
but
you
can
imagine
her
anger.
It
is
the
regret
and
disappointment
of
a
sister,
who
thinks
her
brother
has
a
right
to
everything
he
may
wish
for,
at
the
first
moment.
She
is
hurt,
as
you
would
be
for
William;
but
she
loves
and
esteems
you
with
all
her
heart."
"I
knew
she
would
be
very
angry
with
me."
"My
dearest
Fanny,"
cried
Edmund,
pressing
her
arm
closer
to
him,
"do
not
let
the
idea
of
her
anger
distress
you.
It
is
anger
to
be
talked
of
rather
than
felt.
Her
heart
is
made
for
love
and
kindness,
not
for
resentment.
I
wish
you
could
have
overheard
her
tribute
of
praise;
I
wish
you
could
have
seen
her
countenance,
when
she
said
that
you
should
be
Henry's
wife.
And
I
observed
that
she
always
spoke
of
you
as
'Fanny,'
which
she
was
never
used
to
do;
and
it
had
a
sound
of
most
sisterly
cordiality."
"And
Mrs.
Grant,
did
she
say
did
she
speak;
was
she
there
all
the
time?"
"Yes,
she
was
agreeing
exactly
with
her
sister.
The
surprise
of
your
refusal,
Fanny,
seems
to
have
been
unbounded.
That
you
could
refuse
such
a
man
as
Henry
Crawford
seems
more
than
they
can
understand.
I
said
what
I
could
for
you;
but
in
good
truth,
as
they
stated
the
case
you
must
prove
yourself
to
be
in
your
senses
as
soon
as
you
can
by
a
different
conduct;
nothing
else
will
satisfy
them.
But
this
is
teasing
you.
I
have
done.
Do
not
turn
away
from
me."
"I
should
have
thought,"
said
Fanny,
after
a
pause
of
recollection
and
exertion,
"that
every
woman
must
have
felt
the
possibility
of
a
man's
not
being
approved,
not
being
loved
by
some
one
of
her
sex
at
least,
let
him
be
ever
so
generally
agreeable.
Let
him
have
all
the
perfections
in
the
world,
I
think
it
ought
not
to
be
set
down
as
certain
that
a
man
must
be
acceptable
to
every
woman
he
may
happen
to
like
himself.
But,
even
supposing
it
is
so,
allowing
Mr.
Crawford
to
have
all
the
claims
which
his
sisters
think
he
has,
how
was
I
to
be
prepared
to
meet
him
with
any
feeling
answerable
to
his
own?
He
took
me
wholly
by
surprise.
I
had
not
an
idea
that
his
behaviour
to
me
before
had
any
meaning;
and
surely
I
was
not
to
be
teaching
myself
to
like
him
only
because
he
was
taking
what
seemed
very
idle
notice
of
me.
In
my
situation,
it
would
have
been
the
extreme
of
vanity
to
be
forming
expectations
on
Mr.
Crawford.
I
am
sure
his
sisters,
rating
him
as
they
do,
must
have
thought
it
so,
supposing
he
had
meant
nothing.
How,
then,
was
I
to
be
to
be
in
love
with
him
the
moment
he
said
he
was
with
me?
How
was
I
to
have
an
attachment
at
his
service,
as
soon
as
it
was
asked
for?
His
sisters
should
consider
me
as
well
as
him.
The
higher
his
deserts,
the
more
improper
for
me
ever
to
have
thought
of
him.
And,
and
we
think
very
differently
of
the
nature
of
women,
if
they
can
imagine
a
woman
so
very
soon
capable
of
returning
an
affection
as
this
seems
to
imply."
"My
dear,
dear
Fanny,
now
I
have
the
truth.
I
know
this
to
be
the
truth;
and
most
worthy
of
you
are
such
feelings.
I
had
attributed
them
to
you
before.
I
thought
I
could
understand
you.
You
have
now
given
exactly
the
explanation
which
I
ventured
to
make
for
you
to
your
friend
and
Mrs.
Grant,
and
they
were
both
better
satisfied,
though
your
warm
hearted
friend
was
still
run
away
with
a
little
by
the
enthusiasm
of
her
fondness
for
Henry.
I
told
them
that
you
were
of
all
human
creatures
the
one
over
whom
habit
had
most
power
and
novelty
least;
and
that
the
very
circumstance
of
the
novelty
of
Crawford's
addresses
was
against
him.
Their
being
so
new
and
so
recent
was
all
in
their
disfavour;
that
you
could
tolerate
nothing
that
you
were
not
used
to;
and
a
great
deal
more
to
the
same
purpose,
to
give
them
a
knowledge
of
your
character.
Miss
Crawford
made
us
laugh
by
her
plans
of
encouragement
for
her
brother.
She
meant
to
urge
him
to
persevere
in
the
hope
of
being
loved
in
time,
and
of
having
his
addresses
most
kindly
received
at
the
end
of
about
ten
years'
happy
marriage."
Fanny
could
with
difficulty
give
the
smile
that
was
here
asked
for.
Her
feelings
were
all
in
revolt.
She
feared
she
had
been
doing
wrong:
saying
too
much,
overacting
the
caution
which
she
had
been
fancying
necessary;
in
guarding
against
one
evil,
laying
herself
open
to
another;
and
to
have
Miss
Crawford's
liveliness
repeated
to
her
at
such
a
moment,
and
on
such
a
subject,
was
a
bitter
aggravation.
Edmund
saw
weariness
and
distress
in
her
face,
and
immediately
resolved
to
forbear
all
farther
discussion;
and
not
even
to
mention
the
name
of
Crawford
again,
except
as
it
might
be
connected
with
what
must
be
agreeable
to
her.
On
this
principle,
he
soon
afterwards
observed
"They
go
on
Monday.
You
are
sure,
therefore,
of
seeing
your
friend
either
to
morrow
or
Sunday.
They
really
go
on
Monday;
and
I
was
within
a
trifle
of
being
persuaded
to
stay
at
Lessingby
till
that
very
day!
I
had
almost
promised
it.
What
a
difference
it
might
have
made!
Those
five
or
six
days
more
at
Lessingby
might
have
been
felt
all
my
life."
"You
were
near
staying
there?"
"Very.
I
was
most
kindly
pressed,
and
had
nearly
consented.
Had
I
received
any
letter
from
Mansfield,
to
tell
me
how
you
were
all
going
on,
I
believe
I
should
certainly
have
staid;
but
I
knew
nothing
that
had
happened
here
for
a
fortnight,
and
felt
that
I
had
been
away
long
enough."
"You
spent
your
time
pleasantly
there?"
"Yes;
that
is,
it
was
the
fault
of
my
own
mind
if
I
did
not.
They
were
all
very
pleasant.
I
doubt
their
finding
me
so.
I
took
uneasiness
with
me,
and
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
it
till
I
was
in
Mansfield
again."
"The
Miss
Owens
you
liked
them,
did
not
you?"
"Yes,
very
well.
Pleasant,
good
humoured,
unaffected
girls.
But
I
am
spoilt,
Fanny,
for
common
female
society.
Good
humoured,
unaffected
girls
will
not
do
for
a
man
who
has
been
used
to
sensible
women.
They
are
two
distinct
orders
of
being.
You
and
Miss
Crawford
have
made
me
too
nice."
Still,
however,
Fanny
was
oppressed
and
wearied;
he
saw
it
in
her
looks,
it
could
not
be
talked
away;
and
attempting
it
no
more,
he
led
her
directly,
with
the
kind
authority
of
a
privileged
guardian,
into
the
house.
Edmund
now
believed
himself
perfectly
acquainted
with
all
that
Fanny
could
tell,
or
could
leave
to
be
conjectured
of
her
sentiments,
and
he
was
satisfied.
It
had
been,
as
he
before
presumed,
too
hasty
a
measure
on
Crawford's
side,
and
time
must
be
given
to
make
the
idea
first
familiar,
and
then
agreeable
to
her.
She
must
be
used
to
the
consideration
of
his
being
in
love
with
her,
and
then
a
return
of
affection
might
not
be
very
distant.
He
gave
this
opinion
as
the
result
of
the
conversation
to
his
father;
and
recommended
there
being
nothing
more
said
to
her:
no
farther
attempts
to
influence
or
persuade;
but
that
everything
should
be
left
to
Crawford's
assiduities,
and
the
natural
workings
of
her
own
mind.
Sir
Thomas
promised
that
it
should
be
so.
Edmund's
account
of
Fanny's
disposition
he
could
believe
to
be
just;
he
supposed
she
had
all
those
feelings,
but
he
must
consider
it
as
very
unfortunate
that
she
had;
for,
less
willing
than
his
son
to
trust
to
the
future,
he
could
not
help
fearing
that
if
such
very
long
allowances
of
time
and
habit
were
necessary
for
her,
she
might
not
have
persuaded
herself
into
receiving
his
addresses
properly
before
the
young
man's
inclination
for
paying
them
were
over.
There
was
nothing
to
be
done,
however,
but
to
submit
quietly
and
hope
the
best.
The
promised
visit
from
"her
friend,"
as
Edmund
called
Miss
Crawford,
was
a
formidable
threat
to
Fanny,
and
she
lived
in
continual
terror
of
it.
As
a
sister,
so
partial
and
so
angry,
and
so
little
scrupulous
of
what
she
said,
and
in
another
light
so
triumphant
and
secure,
she
was
in
every
way
an
object
of
painful
alarm.
Her
displeasure,
her
penetration,
and
her
happiness
were
all
fearful
to
encounter;
and
the
dependence
of
having
others
present
when
they
met
was
Fanny's
only
support
in
looking
forward
to
it.
She
absented
herself
as
little
as
possible
from
Lady
Bertram,
kept
away
from
the
East
room,
and
took
no
solitary
walk
in
the
shrubbery,
in
her
caution
to
avoid
any
sudden
attack.
She
succeeded.
She
was
safe
in
the
breakfast
room,
with
her
aunt,
when
Miss
Crawford
did
come;
and
the
first
misery
over,
and
Miss
Crawford
looking
and
speaking
with
much
less
particularity
of
expression
than
she
had
anticipated,
Fanny
began
to
hope
there
would
be
nothing
worse
to
be
endured
than
a
half
hour
of
moderate
agitation.
But
here
she
hoped
too
much;
Miss
Crawford
was
not
the
slave
of
opportunity.
She
was
determined
to
see
Fanny
alone,
and
therefore
said
to
her
tolerably
soon,
in
a
low
voice,
"I
must
speak
to
you
for
a
few
minutes
somewhere";
words
that
Fanny
felt
all
over
her,
in
all
her
pulses
and
all
her
nerves.
Denial
was
impossible.
Her
habits
of
ready
submission,
on
the
contrary,
made
her
almost
instantly
rise
and
lead
the
way
out
of
the
room.
She
did
it
with
wretched
feelings,
but
it
was
inevitable.
They
were
no
sooner
in
the
hall
than
all
restraint
of
countenance
was
over
on
Miss
Crawford's
side.
She
immediately
shook
her
head
at
Fanny
with
arch,
yet
affectionate
reproach,
and
taking
her
hand,
seemed
hardly
able
to
help
beginning
directly.
She
said
nothing,
however,
but,
"Sad,
sad
girl!
I
do
not
know
when
I
shall
have
done
scolding
you,"
and
had
discretion
enough
to
reserve
the
rest
till
they
might
be
secure
of
having
four
walls
to
themselves.
Fanny
naturally
turned
upstairs,
and
took
her
guest
to
the
apartment
which
was
now
always
fit
for
comfortable
use;
opening
the
door,
however,
with
a
most
aching
heart,
and
feeling
that
she
had
a
more
distressing
scene
before
her
than
ever
that
spot
had
yet
witnessed.
But
the
evil
ready
to
burst
on
her
was
at
least
delayed
by
the
sudden
change
in
Miss
Crawford's
ideas;
by
the
strong
effect
on
her
mind
which
the
finding
herself
in
the
East
room
again
produced.
"Ha!"
she
cried,
with
instant
animation,
"am
I
here
again?
The
East
room!
Once
only
was
I
in
this
room
before";
and
after
stopping
to
look
about
her,
and
seemingly
to
retrace
all
that
had
then
passed,
she
added,
"Once
only
before.
Do
you
remember
it?
I
came
to
rehearse.
Your
cousin
came
too;
and
we
had
a
rehearsal.
You
were
our
audience
and
prompter.
A
delightful
rehearsal.
I
shall
never
forget
it.
Here
we
were,
just
in
this
part
of
the
room:
here
was
your
cousin,
here
was
I,
here
were
the
chairs.
Oh!
why
will
such
things
ever
pass
away?"
Happily
for
her
companion,
she
wanted
no
answer.
Her
mind
was
entirely
self
engrossed.
She
was
in
a
reverie
of
sweet
remembrances.
"The
scene
we
were
rehearsing
was
so
very
remarkable!
The
subject
of
it
so
very
very
what
shall
I
say?
He
was
to
be
describing
and
recommending
matrimony
to
me.
I
think
I
see
him
now,
trying
to
be
as
demure
and
composed
as
Anhalt
ought,
through
the
two
long
speeches.
'When
two
sympathetic
hearts
meet
in
the
marriage
state,
matrimony
may
be
called
a
happy
life.'
I
suppose
no
time
can
ever
wear
out
the
impression
I
have
of
his
looks
and
voice
as
he
said
those
words.
It
was
curious,
very
curious,
that
we
should
have
such
a
scene
to
play!
If
I
had
the
power
of
recalling
any
one
week
of
my
existence,
it
should
be
that
week
that
acting
week.
Say
what
you
would,
Fanny,
it
should
be
that;
for
I
never
knew
such
exquisite
happiness
in
any
other.
His
sturdy
spirit
to
bend
as
it
did!
Oh!
it
was
sweet
beyond
expression.
But
alas,
that
very
evening
destroyed
it
all.
That
very
evening
brought
your
most
unwelcome
uncle.
Poor
Sir
Thomas,
who
was
glad
to
see
you?
Yet,
Fanny,
do
not
imagine
I
would
now
speak
disrespectfully
of
Sir
Thomas,
though
I
certainly
did
hate
him
for
many
a
week.
No,
I
do
him
justice
now.
He
is
just
what
the
head
of
such
a
family
should
be.
Nay,
in
sober
sadness,
I
believe
I
now
love
you
all."
And
having
said
so,
with
a
degree
of
tenderness
and
consciousness
which
Fanny
had
never
seen
in
her
before,
and
now
thought
only
too
becoming,
she
turned
away
for
a
moment
to
recover
herself.
"I
have
had
a
little
fit
since
I
came
into
this
room,
as
you
may
perceive,"
said
she
presently,
with
a
playful
smile,
"but
it
is
over
now;
so
let
us
sit
down
and
be
comfortable;
for
as
to
scolding
you,
Fanny,
which
I
came
fully
intending
to
do,
I
have
not
the
heart
for
it
when
it
comes
to
the
point."
And
embracing
her
very
affectionately,
"Good,
gentle
Fanny!
when
I
think
of
this
being
the
last
time
of
seeing
you
for
I
do
not
know
how
long,
I
feel
it
quite
impossible
to
do
anything
but
love
you."
Fanny
was
affected.
She
had
not
foreseen
anything
of
this,
and
her
feelings
could
seldom
withstand
the
melancholy
influence
of
the
word
"last."
She
cried
as
if
she
had
loved
Miss
Crawford
more
than
she
possibly
could;
and
Miss
Crawford,
yet
farther
softened
by
the
sight
of
such
emotion,
hung
about
her
with
fondness,
and
said,
"I
hate
to
leave
you.
I
shall
see
no
one
half
so
amiable
where
I
am
going.
Who
says
we
shall
not
be
sisters?
I
know
we
shall.
I
feel
that
we
are
born
to
be
connected;
and
those
tears
convince
me
that
you
feel
it
too,
dear
Fanny."
Fanny
roused
herself,
and
replying
only
in
part,
said,
"But
you
are
only
going
from
one
set
of
friends
to
another.
You
are
going
to
a
very
particular
friend."
"Yes,
very
true.
Mrs.
Fraser
has
been
my
intimate
friend
for
years.
But
I
have
not
the
least
inclination
to
go
near
her.
I
can
think
only
of
the
friends
I
am
leaving:
my
excellent
sister,
yourself,
and
the
Bertrams
in
general.
You
have
all
so
much
more
heart
among
you
than
one
finds
in
the
world
at
large.
You
all
give
me
a
feeling
of
being
able
to
trust
and
confide
in
you,
which
in
common
intercourse
one
knows
nothing
of.
I
wish
I
had
settled
with
Mrs.
Fraser
not
to
go
to
her
till
after
Easter,
a
much
better
time
for
the
visit,
but
now
I
cannot
put
her
off.
And
when
I
have
done
with
her
I
must
go
to
her
sister,
Lady
Stornaway,
because
she
was
rather
my
most
particular
friend
of
the
two,
but
I
have
not
cared
much
for
her
these
three
years."
After
this
speech
the
two
girls
sat
many
minutes
silent,
each
thoughtful:
Fanny
meditating
on
the
different
sorts
of
friendship
in
the
world,
Mary
on
something
of
less
philosophic
tendency.
She
first
spoke
again.
"How
perfectly
I
remember
my
resolving
to
look
for
you
upstairs,
and
setting
off
to
find
my
way
to
the
East
room,
without
having
an
idea
whereabouts
it
was!
How
well
I
remember
what
I
was
thinking
of
as
I
came
along,
and
my
looking
in
and
seeing
you
here
sitting
at
this
table
at
work;
and
then
your
cousin's
astonishment,
when
he
opened
the
door,
at
seeing
me
here!
To
be
sure,
your
uncle's
returning
that
very
evening!
There
never
was
anything
quite
like
it."
Another
short
fit
of
abstraction
followed,
when,
shaking
it
off,
she
thus
attacked
her
companion.
"Why,
Fanny,
you
are
absolutely
in
a
reverie.
Thinking,
I
hope,
of
one
who
is
always
thinking
of
you.
Oh!
that
I
could
transport
you
for
a
short
time
into
our
circle
in
town,
that
you
might
understand
how
your
power
over
Henry
is
thought
of
there!
Oh!
the
envyings
and
heartburnings
of
dozens
and
dozens;
the
wonder,
the
incredulity
that
will
be
felt
at
hearing
what
you
have
done!
For
as
to
secrecy,
Henry
is
quite
the
hero
of
an
old
romance,
and
glories
in
his
chains.
You
should
come
to
London
to
know
how
to
estimate
your
conquest.
If
you
were
to
see
how
he
is
courted,
and
how
I
am
courted
for
his
sake!
Now,
I
am
well
aware
that
I
shall
not
be
half
so
welcome
to
Mrs.
Fraser
in
consequence
of
his
situation
with
you.
When
she
comes
to
know
the
truth
she
will,
very
likely,
wish
me
in
Northamptonshire
again;
for
there
is
a
daughter
of
Mr.
Fraser,
by
a
first
wife,
whom
she
is
wild
to
get
married,
and
wants
Henry
to
take.
Oh!
she
has
been
trying
for
him
to
such
a
degree.
Innocent
and
quiet
as
you
sit
here,
you
cannot
have
an
idea
of
the
sensation
that
you
will
be
occasioning,
of
the
curiosity
there
will
be
to
see
you,
of
the
endless
questions
I
shall
have
to
answer!
Poor
Margaret
Fraser
will
be
at
me
for
ever
about
your
eyes
and
your
teeth,
and
how
you
do
your
hair,
and
who
makes
your
shoes.
I
wish
Margaret
were
married,
for
my
poor
friend's
sake,
for
I
look
upon
the
Frasers
to
be
about
as
unhappy
as
most
other
married
people.
And
yet
it
was
a
most
desirable
match
for
Janet
at
the
time.
We
were
all
delighted.
She
could
not
do
otherwise
than
accept
him,
for
he
was
rich,
and
she
had
nothing;
but
he
turns
out
ill
tempered
and
exigeant,
and
wants
a
young
woman,
a
beautiful
young
woman
of
five
and
twenty,
to
be
as
steady
as
himself.
And
my
friend
does
not
manage
him
well;
she
does
not
seem
to
know
how
to
make
the
best
of
it.
There
is
a
spirit
of
irritation
which,
to
say
nothing
worse,
is
certainly
very
ill
bred.
In
their
house
I
shall
call
to
mind
the
conjugal
manners
of
Mansfield
Parsonage
with
respect.
Even
Dr.
Grant
does
shew
a
thorough
confidence
in
my
sister,
and
a
certain
consideration
for
her
judgment,
which
makes
one
feel
there
is
attachment;
but
of
that
I
shall
see
nothing
with
the
Frasers.
I
shall
be
at
Mansfield
for
ever,
Fanny.
My
own
sister
as
a
wife,
Sir
Thomas
Bertram
as
a
husband,
are
my
standards
of
perfection.
Poor
Janet
has
been
sadly
taken
in,
and
yet
there
was
nothing
improper
on
her
side:
she
did
not
run
into
the
match
inconsiderately;
there
was
no
want
of
foresight.
She
took
three
days
to
consider
of
his
proposals,
and
during
those
three
days
asked
the
advice
of
everybody
connected
with
her
whose
opinion
was
worth
having,
and
especially
applied
to
my
late
dear
aunt,
whose
knowledge
of
the
world
made
her
judgment
very
generally
and
deservedly
looked
up
to
by
all
the
young
people
of
her
acquaintance,
and
she
was
decidedly
in
favour
of
Mr.
Fraser.
This
seems
as
if
nothing
were
a
security
for
matrimonial
comfort.
I
have
not
so
much
to
say
for
my
friend
Flora,
who
jilted
a
very
nice
young
man
in
the
Blues
for
the
sake
of
that
horrid
Lord
Stornaway,
who
has
about
as
much
sense,
Fanny,
as
Mr.
Rushworth,
but
much
worse
looking,
and
with
a
blackguard
character.
I
had
my
doubts
at
the
time
about
her
being
right,
for
he
has
not
even
the
air
of
a
gentleman,
and
now
I
am
sure
she
was
wrong.
By
the
bye,
Flora
Ross
was
dying
for
Henry
the
first
winter
she
came
out.
But
were
I
to
attempt
to
tell
you
of
all
the
women
whom
I
have
known
to
be
in
love
with
him,
I
should
never
have
done.
It
is
you,
only
you,
insensible
Fanny,
who
can
think
of
him
with
anything
like
indifference.
But
are
you
so
insensible
as
you
profess
yourself?
No,
no,
I
see
you
are
not."
There
was,
indeed,
so
deep
a
blush
over
Fanny's
face
at
that
moment
as
might
warrant
strong
suspicion
in
a
predisposed
mind.
"Excellent
creature!
I
will
not
tease
you.
Everything
shall
take
its
course.
But,
dear
Fanny,
you
must
allow
that
you
were
not
so
absolutely
unprepared
to
have
the
question
asked
as
your
cousin
fancies.
It
is
not
possible
but
that
you
must
have
had
some
thoughts
on
the
subject,
some
surmises
as
to
what
might
be.
You
must
have
seen
that
he
was
trying
to
please
you
by
every
attention
in
his
power.
Was
not
he
devoted
to
you
at
the
ball?
And
then
before
the
ball,
the
necklace!
Oh!
you
received
it
just
as
it
was
meant.
You
were
as
conscious
as
heart
could
desire.
I
remember
it
perfectly."
"Do
you
mean,
then,
that
your
brother
knew
of
the
necklace
beforehand?
Oh!
Miss
Crawford,
that
was
not
fair."
"Knew
of
it!
It
was
his
own
doing
entirely,
his
own
thought.
I
am
ashamed
to
say
that
it
had
never
entered
my
head,
but
I
was
delighted
to
act
on
his
proposal
for
both
your
sakes."
"I
will
not
say,"
replied
Fanny,
"that
I
was
not
half
afraid
at
the
time
of
its
being
so,
for
there
was
something
in
your
look
that
frightened
me,
but
not
at
first;
I
was
as
unsuspicious
of
it
at
first
indeed,
indeed
I
was.
It
is
as
true
as
that
I
sit
here.
And
had
I
had
an
idea
of
it,
nothing
should
have
induced
me
to
accept
the
necklace.
As
to
your
brother's
behaviour,
certainly
I
was
sensible
of
a
particularity:
I
had
been
sensible
of
it
some
little
time,
perhaps
two
or
three
weeks;
but
then
I
considered
it
as
meaning
nothing:
I
put
it
down
as
simply
being
his
way,
and
was
as
far
from
supposing
as
from
wishing
him
to
have
any
serious
thoughts
of
me.
I
had
not,
Miss
Crawford,
been
an
inattentive
observer
of
what
was
passing
between
him
and
some
part
of
this
family
in
the
summer
and
autumn.
I
was
quiet,
but
I
was
not
blind.
I
could
not
but
see
that
Mr.
Crawford
allowed
himself
in
gallantries
which
did
mean
nothing."
"Ah!
I
cannot
deny
it.
He
has
now
and
then
been
a
sad
flirt,
and
cared
very
little
for
the
havoc
he
might
be
making
in
young
ladies'
affections.
I
have
often
scolded
him
for
it,
but
it
is
his
only
fault;
and
there
is
this
to
be
said,
that
very
few
young
ladies
have
any
affections
worth
caring
for.
And
then,
Fanny,
the
glory
of
fixing
one
who
has
been
shot
at
by
so
many;
of
having
it
in
one's
power
to
pay
off
the
debts
of
one's
sex!
Oh!
I
am
sure
it
is
not
in
woman's
nature
to
refuse
such
a
triumph."
Fanny
shook
her
head.
"I
cannot
think
well
of
a
man
who
sports
with
any
woman's
feelings;
and
there
may
often
be
a
great
deal
more
suffered
than
a
stander
by
can
judge
of."
"I
do
not
defend
him.
I
leave
him
entirely
to
your
mercy,
and
when
he
has
got
you
at
Everingham,
I
do
not
care
how
much
you
lecture
him.
But
this
I
will
say,
that
his
fault,
the
liking
to
make
girls
a
little
in
love
with
him,
is
not
half
so
dangerous
to
a
wife's
happiness
as
a
tendency
to
fall
in
love
himself,
which
he
has
never
been
addicted
to.
And
I
do
seriously
and
truly
believe
that
he
is
attached
to
you
in
a
way
that
he
never
was
to
any
woman
before;
that
he
loves
you
with
all
his
heart,
and
will
love
you
as
nearly
for
ever
as
possible.
If
any
man
ever
loved
a
woman
for
ever,
I
think
Henry
will
do
as
much
for
you."
Fanny
could
not
avoid
a
faint
smile,
but
had
nothing
to
say.
"I
cannot
imagine
Henry
ever
to
have
been
happier,"
continued
Mary
presently,
"than
when
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
your
brother's
commission."
She
had
made
a
sure
push
at
Fanny's
feelings
here.
"Oh!
yes.
How
very,
very
kind
of
him."
"I
know
he
must
have
exerted
himself
very
much,
for
I
know
the
parties
he
had
to
move.
The
Admiral
hates
trouble,
and
scorns
asking
favours;
and
there
are
so
many
young
men's
claims
to
be
attended
to
in
the
same
way,
that
a
friendship
and
energy,
not
very
determined,
is
easily
put
by.
What
a
happy
creature
William
must
be!
I
wish
we
could
see
him."
Poor
Fanny's
mind
was
thrown
into
the
most
distressing
of
all
its
varieties.
The
recollection
of
what
had
been
done
for
William
was
always
the
most
powerful
disturber
of
every
decision
against
Mr.
Crawford;
and
she
sat
thinking
deeply
of
it
till
Mary,
who
had
been
first
watching
her
complacently,
and
then
musing
on
something
else,
suddenly
called
her
attention
by
saying:
"I
should
like
to
sit
talking
with
you
here
all
day,
but
we
must
not
forget
the
ladies
below,
and
so
good
bye,
my
dear,
my
amiable,
my
excellent
Fanny,
for
though
we
shall
nominally
part
in
the
breakfast
parlour,
I
must
take
leave
of
you
here.
And
I
do
take
leave,
longing
for
a
happy
reunion,
and
trusting
that
when
we
meet
again,
it
will
be
under
circumstances
which
may
open
our
hearts
to
each
other
without
any
remnant
or
shadow
of
reserve."
A
very,
very
kind
embrace,
and
some
agitation
of
manner,
accompanied
these
words.
"I
shall
see
your
cousin
in
town
soon:
he
talks
of
being
there
tolerably
soon;
and
Sir
Thomas,
I
dare
say,
in
the
course
of
the
spring;
and
your
eldest
cousin,
and
the
Rushworths,
and
Julia,
I
am
sure
of
meeting
again
and
again,
and
all
but
you.
I
have
two
favours
to
ask,
Fanny:
one
is
your
correspondence.
You
must
write
to
me.
And
the
other,
that
you
will
often
call
on
Mrs.
Grant,
and
make
her
amends
for
my
being
gone."
The
first,
at
least,
of
these
favours
Fanny
would
rather
not
have
been
asked;
but
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
refuse
the
correspondence;
it
was
impossible
for
her
even
not
to
accede
to
it
more
readily
than
her
own
judgment
authorised.
There
was
no
resisting
so
much
apparent
affection.
Her
disposition
was
peculiarly
calculated
to
value
a
fond
treatment,
and
from
having
hitherto
known
so
little
of
it,
she
was
the
more
overcome
by
Miss
Crawford's.
Besides,
there
was
gratitude
towards
her,
for
having
made
their
tete
a
tete
so
much
less
painful
than
her
fears
had
predicted.
It
was
over,
and
she
had
escaped
without
reproaches
and
without
detection.
Her
secret
was
still
her
own;
and
while
that
was
the
case,
she
thought
she
could
resign
herself
to
almost
everything.
In
the
evening
there
was
another
parting.
Henry
Crawford
came
and
sat
some
time
with
them;
and
her
spirits
not
being
previously
in
the
strongest
state,
her
heart
was
softened
for
a
while
towards
him,
because
he
really
seemed
to
feel.
Quite
unlike
his
usual
self,
he
scarcely
said
anything.
He
was
evidently
oppressed,
and
Fanny
must
grieve
for
him,
though
hoping
she
might
never
see
him
again
till
he
were
the
husband
of
some
other
woman.
When
it
came
to
the
moment
of
parting,
he
would
take
her
hand,
he
would
not
be
denied
it;
he
said
nothing,
however,
or
nothing
that
she
heard,
and
when
he
had
left
the
room,
she
was
better
pleased
that
such
a
token
of
friendship
had
passed.
On
the
morrow
the
Crawfords
were
gone.
Mr.
Crawford
gone,
Sir
Thomas's
next
object
was
that
he
should
be
missed;
and
he
entertained
great
hope
that
his
niece
would
find
a
blank
in
the
loss
of
those
attentions
which
at
the
time
she
had
felt,
or
fancied,
an
evil.
She
had
tasted
of
consequence
in
its
most
flattering
form;
and
he
did
hope
that
the
loss
of
it,
the
sinking
again
into
nothing,
would
awaken
very
wholesome
regrets
in
her
mind.
He
watched
her
with
this
idea;
but
he
could
hardly
tell
with
what
success.
He
hardly
knew
whether
there
were
any
difference
in
her
spirits
or
not.
She
was
always
so
gentle
and
retiring
that
her
emotions
were
beyond
his
discrimination.
He
did
not
understand
her:
he
felt
that
he
did
not;
and
therefore
applied
to
Edmund
to
tell
him
how
she
stood
affected
on
the
present
occasion,
and
whether
she
were
more
or
less
happy
than
she
had
been.
Edmund
did
not
discern
any
symptoms
of
regret,
and
thought
his
father
a
little
unreasonable
in
supposing
the
first
three
or
four
days
could
produce
any.
What
chiefly
surprised
Edmund
was,
that
Crawford's
sister,
the
friend
and
companion
who
had
been
so
much
to
her,
should
not
be
more
visibly
regretted.
He
wondered
that
Fanny
spoke
so
seldom
of
her,
and
had
so
little
voluntarily
to
say
of
her
concern
at
this
separation.
Alas!
it
was
this
sister,
this
friend
and
companion,
who
was
now
the
chief
bane
of
Fanny's
comfort.
If
she
could
have
believed
Mary's
future
fate
as
unconnected
with
Mansfield
as
she
was
determined
the
brother's
should
be,
if
she
could
have
hoped
her
return
thither
to
be
as
distant
as
she
was
much
inclined
to
think
his,
she
would
have
been
light
of
heart
indeed;
but
the
more
she
recollected
and
observed,
the
more
deeply
was
she
convinced
that
everything
was
now
in
a
fairer
train
for
Miss
Crawford's
marrying
Edmund
than
it
had
ever
been
before.
On
his
side
the
inclination
was
stronger,
on
hers
less
equivocal.
His
objections,
the
scruples
of
his
integrity,
seemed
all
done
away,
nobody
could
tell
how;
and
the
doubts
and
hesitations
of
her
ambition
were
equally
got
over
and
equally
without
apparent
reason.
It
could
only
be
imputed
to
increasing
attachment.
His
good
and
her
bad
feelings
yielded
to
love,
and
such
love
must
unite
them.
He
was
to
go
to
town
as
soon
as
some
business
relative
to
Thornton
Lacey
were
completed
perhaps
within
a
fortnight;
he
talked
of
going,
he
loved
to
talk
of
it;
and
when
once
with
her
again,
Fanny
could
not
doubt
the
rest.
Her
acceptance
must
be
as
certain
as
his
offer;
and
yet
there
were
bad
feelings
still
remaining
which
made
the
prospect
of
it
most
sorrowful
to
her,
independently,
she
believed,
independently
of
self.
In
their
very
last
conversation,
Miss
Crawford,
in
spite
of
some
amiable
sensations,
and
much
personal
kindness,
had
still
been
Miss
Crawford;
still
shewn
a
mind
led
astray
and
bewildered,
and
without
any
suspicion
of
being
so;
darkened,
yet
fancying
itself
light.
She
might
love,
but
she
did
not
deserve
Edmund
by
any
other
sentiment.
Fanny
believed
there
was
scarcely
a
second
feeling
in
common
between
them;
and
she
may
be
forgiven
by
older
sages
for
looking
on
the
chance
of
Miss
Crawford's
future
improvement
as
nearly
desperate,
for
thinking
that
if
Edmund's
influence
in
this
season
of
love
had
already
done
so
little
in
clearing
her
judgment,
and
regulating
her
notions,
his
worth
would
be
finally
wasted
on
her
even
in
years
of
matrimony.
Experience
might
have
hoped
more
for
any
young
people
so
circumstanced,
and
impartiality
would
not
have
denied
to
Miss
Crawford's
nature
that
participation
of
the
general
nature
of
women
which
would
lead
her
to
adopt
the
opinions
of
the
man
she
loved
and
respected
as
her
own.
But
as
such
were
Fanny's
persuasions,
she
suffered
very
much
from
them,
and
could
never
speak
of
Miss
Crawford
without
pain.
Sir
Thomas,
meanwhile,
went
on
with
his
own
hopes
and
his
own
observations,
still
feeling
a
right,
by
all
his
knowledge
of
human
nature,
to
expect
to
see
the
effect
of
the
loss
of
power
and
consequence
on
his
niece's
spirits,
and
the
past
attentions
of
the
lover
producing
a
craving
for
their
return;
and
he
was
soon
afterwards
able
to
account
for
his
not
yet
completely
and
indubitably
seeing
all
this,
by
the
prospect
of
another
visitor,
whose
approach
he
could
allow
to
be
quite
enough
to
support
the
spirits
he
was
watching.
William
had
obtained
a
ten
days'
leave
of
absence,
to
be
given
to
Northamptonshire,
and
was
coming,
the
happiest
of
lieutenants,
because
the
latest
made,
to
shew
his
happiness
and
describe
his
uniform.
He
came;
and
he
would
have
been
delighted
to
shew
his
uniform
there
too,
had
not
cruel
custom
prohibited
its
appearance
except
on
duty.
So
the
uniform
remained
at
Portsmouth,
and
Edmund
conjectured
that
before
Fanny
had
any
chance
of
seeing
it,
all
its
own
freshness
and
all
the
freshness
of
its
wearer's
feelings
must
be
worn
away.
It
would
be
sunk
into
a
badge
of
disgrace;
for
what
can
be
more
unbecoming,
or
more
worthless,
than
the
uniform
of
a
lieutenant,
who
has
been
a
lieutenant
a
year
or
two,
and
sees
others
made
commanders
before
him?
So
reasoned
Edmund,
till
his
father
made
him
the
confidant
of
a
scheme
which
placed
Fanny's
chance
of
seeing
the
second
lieutenant
of
H.M.S.
Thrush
in
all
his
glory
in
another
light.
This
scheme
was
that
she
should
accompany
her
brother
back
to
Portsmouth,
and
spend
a
little
time
with
her
own
family.
It
had
occurred
to
Sir
Thomas,
in
one
of
his
dignified
musings,
as
a
right
and
desirable
measure;
but
before
he
absolutely
made
up
his
mind,
he
consulted
his
son.
Edmund
considered
it
every
way,
and
saw
nothing
but
what
was
right.
The
thing
was
good
in
itself,
and
could
not
be
done
at
a
better
time;
and
he
had
no
doubt
of
it
being
highly
agreeable
to
Fanny.
This
was
enough
to
determine
Sir
Thomas;
and
a
decisive
"then
so
it
shall
be"
closed
that
stage
of
the
business;
Sir
Thomas
retiring
from
it
with
some
feelings
of
satisfaction,
and
views
of
good
over
and
above
what
he
had
communicated
to
his
son;
for
his
prime
motive
in
sending
her
away
had
very
little
to
do
with
the
propriety
of
her
seeing
her
parents
again,
and
nothing
at
all
with
any
idea
of
making
her
happy.
He
certainly
wished
her
to
go
willingly,
but
he
as
certainly
wished
her
to
be
heartily
sick
of
home
before
her
visit
ended;
and
that
a
little
abstinence
from
the
elegancies
and
luxuries
of
Mansfield
Park
would
bring
her
mind
into
a
sober
state,
and
incline
her
to
a
juster
estimate
of
the
value
of
that
home
of
greater
permanence,
and
equal
comfort,
of
which
she
had
the
offer.
It
was
a
medicinal
project
upon
his
niece's
understanding,
which
he
must
consider
as
at
present
diseased.
A
residence
of
eight
or
nine
years
in
the
abode
of
wealth
and
plenty
had
a
little
disordered
her
powers
of
comparing
and
judging.
Her
father's
house
would,
in
all
probability,
teach
her
the
value
of
a
good
income;
and
he
trusted
that
she
would
be
the
wiser
and
happier
woman,
all
her
life,
for
the
experiment
he
had
devised.
Had
Fanny
been
at
all
addicted
to
raptures,
she
must
have
had
a
strong
attack
of
them
when
she
first
understood
what
was
intended,
when
her
uncle
first
made
her
the
offer
of
visiting
the
parents,
and
brothers,
and
sisters,
from
whom
she
had
been
divided
almost
half
her
life;
of
returning
for
a
couple
of
months
to
the
scenes
of
her
infancy,
with
William
for
the
protector
and
companion
of
her
journey,
and
the
certainty
of
continuing
to
see
William
to
the
last
hour
of
his
remaining
on
land.
Had
she
ever
given
way
to
bursts
of
delight,
it
must
have
been
then,
for
she
was
delighted,
but
her
happiness
was
of
a
quiet,
deep,
heart
swelling
sort;
and
though
never
a
great
talker,
she
was
always
more
inclined
to
silence
when
feeling
most
strongly.
At
the
moment
she
could
only
thank
and
accept.
Afterwards,
when
familiarised
with
the
visions
of
enjoyment
so
suddenly
opened,
she
could
speak
more
largely
to
William
and
Edmund
of
what
she
felt;
but
still
there
were
emotions
of
tenderness
that
could
not
be
clothed
in
words.
The
remembrance
of
all
her
earliest
pleasures,
and
of
what
she
had
suffered
in
being
torn
from
them,
came
over
her
with
renewed
strength,
and
it
seemed
as
if
to
be
at
home
again
would
heal
every
pain
that
had
since
grown
out
of
the
separation.
To
be
in
the
centre
of
such
a
circle,
loved
by
so
many,
and
more
loved
by
all
than
she
had
ever
been
before;
to
feel
affection
without
fear
or
restraint;
to
feel
herself
the
equal
of
those
who
surrounded
her;
to
be
at
peace
from
all
mention
of
the
Crawfords,
safe
from
every
look
which
could
be
fancied
a
reproach
on
their
account.
This
was
a
prospect
to
be
dwelt
on
with
a
fondness
that
could
be
but
half
acknowledged.
Edmund,
too
to
be
two
months
from
him
(and
perhaps
she
might
be
allowed
to
make
her
absence
three)
must
do
her
good.
At
a
distance,
unassailed
by
his
looks
or
his
kindness,
and
safe
from
the
perpetual
irritation
of
knowing
his
heart,
and
striving
to
avoid
his
confidence,
she
should
be
able
to
reason
herself
into
a
properer
state;
she
should
be
able
to
think
of
him
as
in
London,
and
arranging
everything
there,
without
wretchedness.
What
might
have
been
hard
to
bear
at
Mansfield
was
to
become
a
slight
evil
at
Portsmouth.
The
only
drawback
was
the
doubt
of
her
aunt
Bertram's
being
comfortable
without
her.
She
was
of
use
to
no
one
else;
but
there
she
might
be
missed
to
a
degree
that
she
did
not
like
to
think
of;
and
that
part
of
the
arrangement
was,
indeed,
the
hardest
for
Sir
Thomas
to
accomplish,
and
what
only
he
could
have
accomplished
at
all.
But
he
was
master
at
Mansfield
Park.
When
he
had
really
resolved
on
any
measure,
he
could
always
carry
it
through;
and
now
by
dint
of
long
talking
on
the
subject,
explaining
and
dwelling
on
the
duty
of
Fanny's
sometimes
seeing
her
family,
he
did
induce
his
wife
to
let
her
go;
obtaining
it
rather
from
submission,
however,
than
conviction,
for
Lady
Bertram
was
convinced
of
very
little
more
than
that
Sir
Thomas
thought
Fanny
ought
to
go,
and
therefore
that
she
must.
In
the
calmness
of
her
own
dressing
room,
in
the
impartial
flow
of
her
own
meditations,
unbiassed
by
his
bewildering
statements,
she
could
not
acknowledge
any
necessity
for
Fanny's
ever
going
near
a
father
and
mother
who
had
done
without
her
so
long,
while
she
was
so
useful
to
herself.
And
as
to
the
not
missing
her,
which
under
Mrs.
Norris's
discussion
was
the
point
attempted
to
be
proved,
she
set
herself
very
steadily
against
admitting
any
such
thing.
Sir
Thomas
had
appealed
to
her
reason,
conscience,
and
dignity.
He
called
it
a
sacrifice,
and
demanded
it
of
her
goodness
and
self
command
as
such.
But
Mrs.
Norris
wanted
to
persuade
her
that
Fanny
could
be
very
well
spared
she
being
ready
to
give
up
all
her
own
time
to
her
as
requested
and,
in
short,
could
not
really
be
wanted
or
missed.
"That
may
be,
sister,"
was
all
Lady
Bertram's
reply.
"I
dare
say
you
are
very
right;
but
I
am
sure
I
shall
miss
her
very
much."
The
next
step
was
to
communicate
with
Portsmouth.
Fanny
wrote
to
offer
herself;
and
her
mother's
answer,
though
short,
was
so
kind
a
few
simple
lines
expressed
so
natural
and
motherly
a
joy
in
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
child
again,
as
to
confirm
all
the
daughter's
views
of
happiness
in
being
with
her
convincing
her
that
she
should
now
find
a
warm
and
affectionate
friend
in
the
"mama"
who
had
certainly
shewn
no
remarkable
fondness
for
her
formerly;
but
this
she
could
easily
suppose
to
have
been
her
own
fault
or
her
own
fancy.
She
had
probably
alienated
love
by
the
helplessness
and
fretfulness
of
a
fearful
temper,
or
been
unreasonable
in
wanting
a
larger
share
than
any
one
among
so
many
could
deserve.
Now,
when
she
knew
better
how
to
be
useful,
and
how
to
forbear,
and
when
her
mother
could
be
no
longer
occupied
by
the
incessant
demands
of
a
house
full
of
little
children,
there
would
be
leisure
and
inclination
for
every
comfort,
and
they
should
soon
be
what
mother
and
daughter
ought
to
be
to
each
other.
William
was
almost
as
happy
in
the
plan
as
his
sister.
It
would
be
the
greatest
pleasure
to
him
to
have
her
there
to
the
last
moment
before
he
sailed,
and
perhaps
find
her
there
still
when
he
came
in
from
his
first
cruise.
And
besides,
he
wanted
her
so
very
much
to
see
the
Thrush
before
she
went
out
of
harbour
the
Thrush
was
certainly
the
finest
sloop
in
the
service
and
there
were
several
improvements
in
the
dockyard,
too,
which
he
quite
longed
to
shew
her.
He
did
not
scruple
to
add
that
her
being
at
home
for
a
while
would
be
a
great
advantage
to
everybody.
"I
do
not
know
how
it
is,"
said
he;
"but
we
seem
to
want
some
of
your
nice
ways
and
orderliness
at
my
father's.
The
house
is
always
in
confusion.
You
will
set
things
going
in
a
better
way,
I
am
sure.
You
will
tell
my
mother
how
it
all
ought
to
be,
and
you
will
be
so
useful
to
Susan,
and
you
will
teach
Betsey,
and
make
the
boys
love
and
mind
you.
How
right
and
comfortable
it
will
all
be!"
By
the
time
Mrs.
Price's
answer
arrived,
there
remained
but
a
very
few
days
more
to
be
spent
at
Mansfield;
and
for
part
of
one
of
those
days
the
young
travellers
were
in
a
good
deal
of
alarm
on
the
subject
of
their
journey,
for
when
the
mode
of
it
came
to
be
talked
of,
and
Mrs.
Norris
found
that
all
her
anxiety
to
save
her
brother
in
law's
money
was
vain,
and
that
in
spite
of
her
wishes
and
hints
for
a
less
expensive
conveyance
of
Fanny,
they
were
to
travel
post;
when
she
saw
Sir
Thomas
actually
give
William
notes
for
the
purpose,
she
was
struck
with
the
idea
of
there
being
room
for
a
third
in
the
carriage,
and
suddenly
seized
with
a
strong
inclination
to
go
with
them,
to
go
and
see
her
poor
dear
sister
Price.
She
proclaimed
her
thoughts.
She
must
say
that
she
had
more
than
half
a
mind
to
go
with
the
young
people;
it
would
be
such
an
indulgence
to
her;
she
had
not
seen
her
poor
dear
sister
Price
for
more
than
twenty
years;
and
it
would
be
a
help
to
the
young
people
in
their
journey
to
have
her
older
head
to
manage
for
them;
and
she
could
not
help
thinking
her
poor
dear
sister
Price
would
feel
it
very
unkind
of
her
not
to
come
by
such
an
opportunity.
William
and
Fanny
were
horror
struck
at
the
idea.
All
the
comfort
of
their
comfortable
journey
would
be
destroyed
at
once.
With
woeful
countenances
they
looked
at
each
other.
Their
suspense
lasted
an
hour
or
two.
No
one
interfered
to
encourage
or
dissuade.
Mrs.
Norris
was
left
to
settle
the
matter
by
herself;
and
it
ended,
to
the
infinite
joy
of
her
nephew
and
niece,
in
the
recollection
that
she
could
not
possibly
be
spared
from
Mansfield
Park
at
present;
that
she
was
a
great
deal
too
necessary
to
Sir
Thomas
and
Lady
Bertram
for
her
to
be
able
to
answer
it
to
herself
to
leave
them
even
for
a
week,
and
therefore
must
certainly
sacrifice
every
other
pleasure
to
that
of
being
useful
to
them.
It
had,
in
fact,
occurred
to
her,
that
though
taken
to
Portsmouth
for
nothing,
it
would
be
hardly
possible
for
her
to
avoid
paying
her
own
expenses
back
again.
So
her
poor
dear
sister
Price
was
left
to
all
the
disappointment
of
her
missing
such
an
opportunity,
and
another
twenty
years'
absence,
perhaps,
begun.
Edmund's
plans
were
affected
by
this
Portsmouth
journey,
this
absence
of
Fanny's.
He
too
had
a
sacrifice
to
make
to
Mansfield
Park
as
well
as
his
aunt.
He
had
intended,
about
this
time,
to
be
going
to
London;
but
he
could
not
leave
his
father
and
mother
just
when
everybody
else
of
most
importance
to
their
comfort
was
leaving
them;
and
with
an
effort,
felt
but
not
boasted
of,
he
delayed
for
a
week
or
two
longer
a
journey
which
he
was
looking
forward
to
with
the
hope
of
its
fixing
his
happiness
for
ever.
He
told
Fanny
of
it.
She
knew
so
much
already,
that
she
must
know
everything.
It
made
the
substance
of
one
other
confidential
discourse
about
Miss
Crawford;
and
Fanny
was
the
more
affected
from
feeling
it
to
be
the
last
time
in
which
Miss
Crawford's
name
would
ever
be
mentioned
between
them
with
any
remains
of
liberty.
Once
afterwards
she
was
alluded
to
by
him.
Lady
Bertram
had
been
telling
her
niece
in
the
evening
to
write
to
her
soon
and
often,
and
promising
to
be
a
good
correspondent
herself;
and
Edmund,
at
a
convenient
moment,
then
added
in
a
whisper,
"And
I
shall
write
to
you,
Fanny,
when
I
have
anything
worth
writing
about,
anything
to
say
that
I
think
you
will
like
to
hear,
and
that
you
will
not
hear
so
soon
from
any
other
quarter."
Had
she
doubted
his
meaning
while
she
listened,
the
glow
in
his
face,
when
she
looked
up
at
him,
would
have
been
decisive.
For
this
letter
she
must
try
to
arm
herself.
That
a
letter
from
Edmund
should
be
a
subject
of
terror!
She
began
to
feel
that
she
had
not
yet
gone
through
all
the
changes
of
opinion
and
sentiment
which
the
progress
of
time
and
variation
of
circumstances
occasion
in
this
world
of
changes.
The
vicissitudes
of
the
human
mind
had
not
yet
been
exhausted
by
her.
Poor
Fanny!
though
going
as
she
did
willingly
and
eagerly,
the
last
evening
at
Mansfield
Park
must
still
be
wretchedness.
Her
heart
was
completely
sad
at
parting.
She
had
tears
for
every
room
in
the
house,
much
more
for
every
beloved
inhabitant.
She
clung
to
her
aunt,
because
she
would
miss
her;
she
kissed
the
hand
of
her
uncle
with
struggling
sobs,
because
she
had
displeased
him;
and
as
for
Edmund,
she
could
neither
speak,
nor
look,
nor
think,
when
the
last
moment
came
with
him;
and
it
was
not
till
it
was
over
that
she
knew
he
was
giving
her
the
affectionate
farewell
of
a
brother.
All
this
passed
overnight,
for
the
journey
was
to
begin
very
early
in
the
morning;
and
when
the
small,
diminished
party
met
at
breakfast,
William
and
Fanny
were
talked
of
as
already
advanced
one
stage.
The
novelty
of
travelling,
and
the
happiness
of
being
with
William,
soon
produced
their
natural
effect
on
Fanny's
spirits,
when
Mansfield
Park
was
fairly
left
behind;
and
by
the
time
their
first
stage
was
ended,
and
they
were
to
quit
Sir
Thomas's
carriage,
she
was
able
to
take
leave
of
the
old
coachman,
and
send
back
proper
messages,
with
cheerful
looks.
Of
pleasant
talk
between
the
brother
and
sister
there
was
no
end.
Everything
supplied
an
amusement
to
the
high
glee
of
William's
mind,
and
he
was
full
of
frolic
and
joke
in
the
intervals
of
their
higher
toned
subjects,
all
of
which
ended,
if
they
did
not
begin,
in
praise
of
the
Thrush,
conjectures
how
she
would
be
employed,
schemes
for
an
action
with
some
superior
force,
which
(supposing
the
first
lieutenant
out
of
the
way,
and
William
was
not
very
merciful
to
the
first
lieutenant)
was
to
give
himself
the
next
step
as
soon
as
possible,
or
speculations
upon
prize
money,
which
was
to
be
generously
distributed
at
home,
with
only
the
reservation
of
enough
to
make
the
little
cottage
comfortable,
in
which
he
and
Fanny
were
to
pass
all
their
middle
and
later
life
together.
Fanny's
immediate
concerns,
as
far
as
they
involved
Mr.
Crawford,
made
no
part
of
their
conversation.
William
knew
what
had
passed,
and
from
his
heart
lamented
that
his
sister's
feelings
should
be
so
cold
towards
a
man
whom
he
must
consider
as
the
first
of
human
characters;
but
he
was
of
an
age
to
be
all
for
love,
and
therefore
unable
to
blame;
and
knowing
her
wish
on
the
subject,
he
would
not
distress
her
by
the
slightest
allusion.
She
had
reason
to
suppose
herself
not
yet
forgotten
by
Mr.
Crawford.
She
had
heard
repeatedly
from
his
sister
within
the
three
weeks
which
had
passed
since
their
leaving
Mansfield,
and
in
each
letter
there
had
been
a
few
lines
from
himself,
warm
and
determined
like
his
speeches.
It
was
a
correspondence
which
Fanny
found
quite
as
unpleasant
as
she
had
feared.
Miss
Crawford's
style
of
writing,
lively
and
affectionate,
was
itself
an
evil,
independent
of
what
she
was
thus
forced
into
reading
from
the
brother's
pen,
for
Edmund
would
never
rest
till
she
had
read
the
chief
of
the
letter
to
him;
and
then
she
had
to
listen
to
his
admiration
of
her
language,
and
the
warmth
of
her
attachments.
There
had,
in
fact,
been
so
much
of
message,
of
allusion,
of
recollection,
so
much
of
Mansfield
in
every
letter,
that
Fanny
could
not
but
suppose
it
meant
for
him
to
hear;
and
to
find
herself
forced
into
a
purpose
of
that
kind,
compelled
into
a
correspondence
which
was
bringing
her
the
addresses
of
the
man
she
did
not
love,
and
obliging
her
to
administer
to
the
adverse
passion
of
the
man
she
did,
was
cruelly
mortifying.
Here,
too,
her
present
removal
promised
advantage.
When
no
longer
under
the
same
roof
with
Edmund,
she
trusted
that
Miss
Crawford
would
have
no
motive
for
writing
strong
enough
to
overcome
the
trouble,
and
that
at
Portsmouth
their
correspondence
would
dwindle
into
nothing.
With
such
thoughts
as
these,
among
ten
hundred
others,
Fanny
proceeded
in
her
journey
safely
and
cheerfully,
and
as
expeditiously
as
could
rationally
be
hoped
in
the
dirty
month
of
February.
They
entered
Oxford,
but
she
could
take
only
a
hasty
glimpse
of
Edmund's
college
as
they
passed
along,
and
made
no
stop
anywhere
till
they
reached
Newbury,
where
a
comfortable
meal,
uniting
dinner
and
supper,
wound
up
the
enjoyments
and
fatigues
of
the
day.
The
next
morning
saw
them
off
again
at
an
early
hour;
and
with
no
events,
and
no
delays,
they
regularly
advanced,
and
were
in
the
environs
of
Portsmouth
while
there
was
yet
daylight
for
Fanny
to
look
around
her,
and
wonder
at
the
new
buildings.
They
passed
the
drawbridge,
and
entered
the
town;
and
the
light
was
only
beginning
to
fail
as,
guided
by
William's
powerful
voice,
they
were
rattled
into
a
narrow
street,
leading
from
the
High
Street,
and
drawn
up
before
the
door
of
a
small
house
now
inhabited
by
Mr.
Price.
Fanny
was
all
agitation
and
flutter;
all
hope
and
apprehension.
The
moment
they
stopped,
a
trollopy
looking
maidservant,
seemingly
in
waiting
for
them
at
the
door,
stepped
forward,
and
more
intent
on
telling
the
news
than
giving
them
any
help,
immediately
began
with,
"The
Thrush
is
gone
out
of
harbour,
please
sir,
and
one
of
the
officers
has
been
here
to
"
She
was
interrupted
by
a
fine
tall
boy
of
eleven
years
old,
who,
rushing
out
of
the
house,
pushed
the
maid
aside,
and
while
William
was
opening
the
chaise
door
himself,
called
out,
"You
are
just
in
time.
We
have
been
looking
for
you
this
half
hour.
The
Thrush
went
out
of
harbour
this
morning.
I
saw
her.
It
was
a
beautiful
sight.
And
they
think
she
will
have
her
orders
in
a
day
or
two.
And
Mr.
Campbell
was
here
at
four
o'clock
to
ask
for
you:
he
has
got
one
of
the
Thrush's
boats,
and
is
going
off
to
her
at
six,
and
hoped
you
would
be
here
in
time
to
go
with
him."
A
stare
or
two
at
Fanny,
as
William
helped
her
out
of
the
carriage,
was
all
the
voluntary
notice
which
this
brother
bestowed;
but
he
made
no
objection
to
her
kissing
him,
though
still
entirely
engaged
in
detailing
farther
particulars
of
the
Thrush's
going
out
of
harbour,
in
which
he
had
a
strong
right
of
interest,
being
to
commence
his
career
of
seamanship
in
her
at
this
very
time.
Another
moment
and
Fanny
was
in
the
narrow
entrance
passage
of
the
house,
and
in
her
mother's
arms,
who
met
her
there
with
looks
of
true
kindness,
and
with
features
which
Fanny
loved
the
more,
because
they
brought
her
aunt
Bertram's
before
her,
and
there
were
her
two
sisters:
Susan,
a
well
grown
fine
girl
of
fourteen,
and
Betsey,
the
youngest
of
the
family,
about
five
both
glad
to
see
her
in
their
way,
though
with
no
advantage
of
manner
in
receiving
her.
But
manner
Fanny
did
not
want.
Would
they
but
love
her,
she
should
be
satisfied.
She
was
then
taken
into
a
parlour,
so
small
that
her
first
conviction
was
of
its
being
only
a
passage
room
to
something
better,
and
she
stood
for
a
moment
expecting
to
be
invited
on;
but
when
she
saw
there
was
no
other
door,
and
that
there
were
signs
of
habitation
before
her,
she
called
back
her
thoughts,
reproved
herself,
and
grieved
lest
they
should
have
been
suspected.
Her
mother,
however,
could
not
stay
long
enough
to
suspect
anything.
She
was
gone
again
to
the
street
door,
to
welcome
William.
"Oh!
my
dear
William,
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you.
But
have
you
heard
about
the
Thrush?
She
is
gone
out
of
harbour
already;
three
days
before
we
had
any
thought
of
it;
and
I
do
not
know
what
I
am
to
do
about
Sam's
things,
they
will
never
be
ready
in
time;
for
she
may
have
her
orders
to
morrow,
perhaps.
It
takes
me
quite
unawares.
And
now
you
must
be
off
for
Spithead
too.
Campbell
has
been
here,
quite
in
a
worry
about
you;
and
now
what
shall
we
do?
I
thought
to
have
had
such
a
comfortable
evening
with
you,
and
here
everything
comes
upon
me
at
once."
Her
son
answered
cheerfully,
telling
her
that
everything
was
always
for
the
best;
and
making
light
of
his
own
inconvenience
in
being
obliged
to
hurry
away
so
soon.
"To
be
sure,
I
had
much
rather
she
had
stayed
in
harbour,
that
I
might
have
sat
a
few
hours
with
you
in
comfort;
but
as
there
is
a
boat
ashore,
I
had
better
go
off
at
once,
and
there
is
no
help
for
it.
Whereabouts
does
the
Thrush
lay
at
Spithead?
Near
the
Canopus?
But
no
matter;
here's
Fanny
in
the
parlour,
and
why
should
we
stay
in
the
passage?
Come,
mother,
you
have
hardly
looked
at
your
own
dear
Fanny
yet."
In
they
both
came,
and
Mrs.
Price
having
kindly
kissed
her
daughter
again,
and
commented
a
little
on
her
growth,
began
with
very
natural
solicitude
to
feel
for
their
fatigues
and
wants
as
travellers.
"Poor
dears!
how
tired
you
must
both
be!
and
now,
what
will
you
have?
I
began
to
think
you
would
never
come.
Betsey
and
I
have
been
watching
for
you
this
half
hour.
And
when
did
you
get
anything
to
eat?
And
what
would
you
like
to
have
now?
I
could
not
tell
whether
you
would
be
for
some
meat,
or
only
a
dish
of
tea,
after
your
journey,
or
else
I
would
have
got
something
ready.
And
now
I
am
afraid
Campbell
will
be
here
before
there
is
time
to
dress
a
steak,
and
we
have
no
butcher
at
hand.
It
is
very
inconvenient
to
have
no
butcher
in
the
street.
We
were
better
off
in
our
last
house.
Perhaps
you
would
like
some
tea
as
soon
as
it
can
be
got."
They
both
declared
they
should
prefer
it
to
anything.
"Then,
Betsey,
my
dear,
run
into
the
kitchen
and
see
if
Rebecca
has
put
the
water
on;
and
tell
her
to
bring
in
the
tea
things
as
soon
as
she
can.
I
wish
we
could
get
the
bell
mended;
but
Betsey
is
a
very
handy
little
messenger."
Betsey
went
with
alacrity,
proud
to
shew
her
abilities
before
her
fine
new
sister.
"Dear
me!"
continued
the
anxious
mother,
"what
a
sad
fire
we
have
got,
and
I
dare
say
you
are
both
starved
with
cold.
Draw
your
chair
nearer,
my
dear.
I
cannot
think
what
Rebecca
has
been
about.
I
am
sure
I
told
her
to
bring
some
coals
half
an
hour
ago.
Susan,
you
should
have
taken
care
of
the
fire."
"I
was
upstairs,
mama,
moving
my
things,"
said
Susan,
in
a
fearless,
self
defending
tone,
which
startled
Fanny.
"You
know
you
had
but
just
settled
that
my
sister
Fanny
and
I
should
have
the
other
room;
and
I
could
not
get
Rebecca
to
give
me
any
help."
Farther
discussion
was
prevented
by
various
bustles:
first,
the
driver
came
to
be
paid;
then
there
was
a
squabble
between
Sam
and
Rebecca
about
the
manner
of
carrying
up
his
sister's
trunk,
which
he
would
manage
all
his
own
way;
and
lastly,
in
walked
Mr.
Price
himself,
his
own
loud
voice
preceding
him,
as
with
something
of
the
oath
kind
he
kicked
away
his
son's
port
manteau
and
his
daughter's
bandbox
in
the
passage,
and
called
out
for
a
candle;
no
candle
was
brought,
however,
and
he
walked
into
the
room.
Fanny
with
doubting
feelings
had
risen
to
meet
him,
but
sank
down
again
on
finding
herself
undistinguished
in
the
dusk,
and
unthought
of.
With
a
friendly
shake
of
his
son's
hand,
and
an
eager
voice,
he
instantly
began
"Ha!
welcome
back,
my
boy.
Glad
to
see
you.
Have
you
heard
the
news?
The
Thrush
went
out
of
harbour
this
morning.
Sharp
is
the
word,
you
see!
By
G
,
you
are
just
in
time!
The
doctor
has
been
here
inquiring
for
you:
he
has
got
one
of
the
boats,
and
is
to
be
off
for
Spithead
by
six,
so
you
had
better
go
with
him.
I
have
been
to
Turner's
about
your
mess;
it
is
all
in
a
way
to
be
done.
I
should
not
wonder
if
you
had
your
orders
to
morrow:
but
you
cannot
sail
with
this
wind,
if
you
are
to
cruise
to
the
westward;
and
Captain
Walsh
thinks
you
will
certainly
have
a
cruise
to
the
westward,
with
the
Elephant.
By
G
,
I
wish
you
may!
But
old
Scholey
was
saying,
just
now,
that
he
thought
you
would
be
sent
first
to
the
Texel.
Well,
well,
we
are
ready,
whatever
happens.
But
by
G
,
you
lost
a
fine
sight
by
not
being
here
in
the
morning
to
see
the
Thrush
go
out
of
harbour!
I
would
not
have
been
out
of
the
way
for
a
thousand
pounds.
Old
Scholey
ran
in
at
breakfast
time,
to
say
she
had
slipped
her
moorings
and
was
coming
out,
I
jumped
up,
and
made
but
two
steps
to
the
platform.
If
ever
there
was
a
perfect
beauty
afloat,
she
is
one;
and
there
she
lays
at
Spithead,
and
anybody
in
England
would
take
her
for
an
eight
and
twenty.
I
was
upon
the
platform
two
hours
this
afternoon
looking
at
her.
She
lays
close
to
the
Endymion,
between
her
and
the
Cleopatra,
just
to
the
eastward
of
the
sheer
hulk."
"Ha!"
cried
William,
"that's
just
where
I
should
have
put
her
myself.
It's
the
best
berth
at
Spithead.
But
here
is
my
sister,
sir;
here
is
Fanny,"
turning
and
leading
her
forward;
"it
is
so
dark
you
do
not
see
her."
With
an
acknowledgment
that
he
had
quite
forgot
her,
Mr.
Price
now
received
his
daughter;
and
having
given
her
a
cordial
hug,
and
observed
that
she
was
grown
into
a
woman,
and
he
supposed
would
be
wanting
a
husband
soon,
seemed
very
much
inclined
to
forget
her
again.
Fanny
shrunk
back
to
her
seat,
with
feelings
sadly
pained
by
his
language
and
his
smell
of
spirits;
and
he
talked
on
only
to
his
son,
and
only
of
the
Thrush,
though
William,
warmly
interested
as
he
was
in
that
subject,
more
than
once
tried
to
make
his
father
think
of
Fanny,
and
her
long
absence
and
long
journey.
After
sitting
some
time
longer,
a
candle
was
obtained;
but
as
there
was
still
no
appearance
of
tea,
nor,
from
Betsey's
reports
from
the
kitchen,
much
hope
of
any
under
a
considerable
period,
William
determined
to
go
and
change
his
dress,
and
make
the
necessary
preparations
for
his
removal
on
board
directly,
that
he
might
have
his
tea
in
comfort
afterwards.
As
he
left
the
room,
two
rosy
faced
boys,
ragged
and
dirty,
about
eight
and
nine
years
old,
rushed
into
it
just
released
from
school,
and
coming
eagerly
to
see
their
sister,
and
tell
that
the
Thrush
was
gone
out
of
harbour;
Tom
and
Charles.
Charles
had
been
born
since
Fanny's
going
away,
but
Tom
she
had
often
helped
to
nurse,
and
now
felt
a
particular
pleasure
in
seeing
again.
Both
were
kissed
very
tenderly,
but
Tom
she
wanted
to
keep
by
her,
to
try
to
trace
the
features
of
the
baby
she
had
loved,
and
talked
to,
of
his
infant
preference
of
herself.
Tom,
however,
had
no
mind
for
such
treatment:
he
came
home
not
to
stand
and
be
talked
to,
but
to
run
about
and
make
a
noise;
and
both
boys
had
soon
burst
from
her,
and
slammed
the
parlour
door
till
her
temples
ached.
She
had
now
seen
all
that
were
at
home;
there
remained
only
two
brothers
between
herself
and
Susan,
one
of
whom
was
a
clerk
in
a
public
office
in
London,
and
the
other
midshipman
on
board
an
Indiaman.
But
though
she
had
seen
all
the
members
of
the
family,
she
had
not
yet
heard
all
the
noise
they
could
make.
Another
quarter
of
an
hour
brought
her
a
great
deal
more.
William
was
soon
calling
out
from
the
landing
place
of
the
second
story
for
his
mother
and
for
Rebecca.
He
was
in
distress
for
something
that
he
had
left
there,
and
did
not
find
again.
A
key
was
mislaid,
Betsey
accused
of
having
got
at
his
new
hat,
and
some
slight,
but
essential
alteration
of
his
uniform
waistcoat,
which
he
had
been
promised
to
have
done
for
him,
entirely
neglected.
Mrs.
Price,
Rebecca,
and
Betsey
all
went
up
to
defend
themselves,
all
talking
together,
but
Rebecca
loudest,
and
the
job
was
to
be
done
as
well
as
it
could
in
a
great
hurry;
William
trying
in
vain
to
send
Betsey
down
again,
or
keep
her
from
being
troublesome
where
she
was;
the
whole
of
which,
as
almost
every
door
in
the
house
was
open,
could
be
plainly
distinguished
in
the
parlour,
except
when
drowned
at
intervals
by
the
superior
noise
of
Sam,
Tom,
and
Charles
chasing
each
other
up
and
down
stairs,
and
tumbling
about
and
hallooing.
Fanny
was
almost
stunned.
The
smallness
of
the
house
and
thinness
of
the
walls
brought
everything
so
close
to
her,
that,
added
to
the
fatigue
of
her
journey,
and
all
her
recent
agitation,
she
hardly
knew
how
to
bear
it.
Within
the
room
all
was
tranquil
enough,
for
Susan
having
disappeared
with
the
others,
there
were
soon
only
her
father
and
herself
remaining;
and
he,
taking
out
a
newspaper,
the
accustomary
loan
of
a
neighbour,
applied
himself
to
studying
it,
without
seeming
to
recollect
her
existence.
The
solitary
candle
was
held
between
himself
and
the
paper,
without
any
reference
to
her
possible
convenience;
but
she
had
nothing
to
do,
and
was
glad
to
have
the
light
screened
from
her
aching
head,
as
she
sat
in
bewildered,
broken,
sorrowful
contemplation.
She
was
at
home.
But,
alas!
it
was
not
such
a
home,
she
had
not
such
a
welcome,
as
she
checked
herself;
she
was
unreasonable.
What
right
had
she
to
be
of
importance
to
her
family?
She
could
have
none,
so
long
lost
sight
of!
William's
concerns
must
be
dearest,
they
always
had
been,
and
he
had
every
right.
Yet
to
have
so
little
said
or
asked
about
herself,
to
have
scarcely
an
inquiry
made
after
Mansfield!
It
did
pain
her
to
have
Mansfield
forgotten;
the
friends
who
had
done
so
much
the
dear,
dear
friends!
But
here,
one
subject
swallowed
up
all
the
rest.
Perhaps
it
must
be
so.
The
destination
of
the
Thrush
must
be
now
preeminently
interesting.
A
day
or
two
might
shew
the
difference.
She
only
was
to
blame.
Yet
she
thought
it
would
not
have
been
so
at
Mansfield.
No,
in
her
uncle's
house
there
would
have
been
a
consideration
of
times
and
seasons,
a
regulation
of
subject,
a
propriety,
an
attention
towards
everybody
which
there
was
not
here.
The
only
interruption
which
thoughts
like
these
received
for
nearly
half
an
hour
was
from
a
sudden
burst
of
her
father's,
not
at
all
calculated
to
compose
them.
At
a
more
than
ordinary
pitch
of
thumping
and
hallooing
in
the
passage,
he
exclaimed,
"Devil
take
those
young
dogs!
How
they
are
singing
out!
Ay,
Sam's
voice
louder
than
all
the
rest!
That
boy
is
fit
for
a
boatswain.
Holla,
you
there!
Sam,
stop
your
confounded
pipe,
or
I
shall
be
after
you."
This
threat
was
so
palpably
disregarded,
that
though
within
five
minutes
afterwards
the
three
boys
all
burst
into
the
room
together
and
sat
down,
Fanny
could
not
consider
it
as
a
proof
of
anything
more
than
their
being
for
the
time
thoroughly
fagged,
which
their
hot
faces
and
panting
breaths
seemed
to
prove,
especially
as
they
were
still
kicking
each
other's
shins,
and
hallooing
out
at
sudden
starts
immediately
under
their
father's
eye.
The
next
opening
of
the
door
brought
something
more
welcome:
it
was
for
the
tea
things,
which
she
had
begun
almost
to
despair
of
seeing
that
evening.
Susan
and
an
attendant
girl,
whose
inferior
appearance
informed
Fanny,
to
her
great
surprise,
that
she
had
previously
seen
the
upper
servant,
brought
in
everything
necessary
for
the
meal;
Susan
looking,
as
she
put
the
kettle
on
the
fire
and
glanced
at
her
sister,
as
if
divided
between
the
agreeable
triumph
of
shewing
her
activity
and
usefulness,
and
the
dread
of
being
thought
to
demean
herself
by
such
an
office.
"She
had
been
into
the
kitchen,"
she
said,
"to
hurry
Sally
and
help
make
the
toast,
and
spread
the
bread
and
butter,
or
she
did
not
know
when
they
should
have
got
tea,
and
she
was
sure
her
sister
must
want
something
after
her
journey."
Fanny
was
very
thankful.
She
could
not
but
own
that
she
should
be
very
glad
of
a
little
tea,
and
Susan
immediately
set
about
making
it,
as
if
pleased
to
have
the
employment
all
to
herself;
and
with
only
a
little
unnecessary
bustle,
and
some
few
injudicious
attempts
at
keeping
her
brothers
in
better
order
than
she
could,
acquitted
herself
very
well.
Fanny's
spirit
was
as
much
refreshed
as
her
body;
her
head
and
heart
were
soon
the
better
for
such
well
timed
kindness.
Susan
had
an
open,
sensible
countenance;
she
was
like
William,
and
Fanny
hoped
to
find
her
like
him
in
disposition
and
goodwill
towards
herself.
In
this
more
placid
state
of
things
William
reentered,
followed
not
far
behind
by
his
mother
and
Betsey.
He,
complete
in
his
lieutenant's
uniform,
looking
and
moving
all
the
taller,
firmer,
and
more
graceful
for
it,
and
with
the
happiest
smile
over
his
face,
walked
up
directly
to
Fanny,
who,
rising
from
her
seat,
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
in
speechless
admiration,
and
then
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
to
sob
out
her
various
emotions
of
pain
and
pleasure.
Anxious
not
to
appear
unhappy,
she
soon
recovered
herself;
and
wiping
away
her
tears,
was
able
to
notice
and
admire
all
the
striking
parts
of
his
dress;
listening
with
reviving
spirits
to
his
cheerful
hopes
of
being
on
shore
some
part
of
every
day
before
they
sailed,
and
even
of
getting
her
to
Spithead
to
see
the
sloop.
The
next
bustle
brought
in
Mr.
Campbell,
the
surgeon
of
the
Thrush,
a
very
well
behaved
young
man,
who
came
to
call
for
his
friend,
and
for
whom
there
was
with
some
contrivance
found
a
chair,
and
with
some
hasty
washing
of
the
young
tea
maker's,
a
cup
and
saucer;
and
after
another
quarter
of
an
hour
of
earnest
talk
between
the
gentlemen,
noise
rising
upon
noise,
and
bustle
upon
bustle,
men
and
boys
at
last
all
in
motion
together,
the
moment
came
for
setting
off;
everything
was
ready,
William
took
leave,
and
all
of
them
were
gone;
for
the
three
boys,
in
spite
of
their
mother's
entreaty,
determined
to
see
their
brother
and
Mr.
Campbell
to
the
sally
port;
and
Mr.
Price
walked
off
at
the
same
time
to
carry
back
his
neighbour's
newspaper.
Something
like
tranquillity
might
now
be
hoped
for;
and
accordingly,
when
Rebecca
had
been
prevailed
on
to
carry
away
the
tea
things,
and
Mrs.
Price
had
walked
about
the
room
some
time
looking
for
a
shirt
sleeve,
which
Betsey
at
last
hunted
out
from
a
drawer
in
the
kitchen,
the
small
party
of
females
were
pretty
well
composed,
and
the
mother
having
lamented
again
over
the
impossibility
of
getting
Sam
ready
in
time,
was
at
leisure
to
think
of
her
eldest
daughter
and
the
friends
she
had
come
from.
A
few
inquiries
began:
but
one
of
the
earliest
"How
did
sister
Bertram
manage
about
her
servants?"
"Was
she
as
much
plagued
as
herself
to
get
tolerable
servants?"
soon
led
her
mind
away
from
Northamptonshire,
and
fixed
it
on
her
own
domestic
grievances,
and
the
shocking
character
of
all
the
Portsmouth
servants,
of
whom
she
believed
her
own
two
were
the
very
worst,
engrossed
her
completely.
The
Bertrams
were
all
forgotten
in
detailing
the
faults
of
Rebecca,
against
whom
Susan
had
also
much
to
depose,
and
little
Betsey
a
great
deal
more,
and
who
did
seem
so
thoroughly
without
a
single
recommendation,
that
Fanny
could
not
help
modestly
presuming
that
her
mother
meant
to
part
with
her
when
her
year
was
up.
"Her
year!"
cried
Mrs.
Price;
"I
am
sure
I
hope
I
shall
be
rid
of
her
before
she
has
staid
a
year,
for
that
will
not
be
up
till
November.
Servants
are
come
to
such
a
pass,
my
dear,
in
Portsmouth,
that
it
is
quite
a
miracle
if
one
keeps
them
more
than
half
a
year.
I
have
no
hope
of
ever
being
settled;
and
if
I
was
to
part
with
Rebecca,
I
should
only
get
something
worse.
And
yet
I
do
not
think
I
am
a
very
difficult
mistress
to
please;
and
I
am
sure
the
place
is
easy
enough,
for
there
is
always
a
girl
under
her,
and
I
often
do
half
the
work
myself."
Fanny
was
silent;
but
not
from
being
convinced
that
there
might
not
be
a
remedy
found
for
some
of
these
evils.
As
she
now
sat
looking
at
Betsey,
she
could
not
but
think
particularly
of
another
sister,
a
very
pretty
little
girl,
whom
she
had
left
there
not
much
younger
when
she
went
into
Northamptonshire,
who
had
died
a
few
years
afterwards.
There
had
been
something
remarkably
amiable
about
her.
Fanny
in
those
early
days
had
preferred
her
to
Susan;
and
when
the
news
of
her
death
had
at
last
reached
Mansfield,
had
for
a
short
time
been
quite
afflicted.
The
sight
of
Betsey
brought
the
image
of
little
Mary
back
again,
but
she
would
not
have
pained
her
mother
by
alluding
to
her
for
the
world.
While
considering
her
with
these
ideas,
Betsey,
at
a
small
distance,
was
holding
out
something
to
catch
her
eyes,
meaning
to
screen
it
at
the
same
time
from
Susan's.
"What
have
you
got
there,
my
love?"
said
Fanny;
"come
and
shew
it
to
me."
It
was
a
silver
knife.
Up
jumped
Susan,
claiming
it
as
her
own,
and
trying
to
get
it
away;
but
the
child
ran
to
her
mother's
protection,
and
Susan
could
only
reproach,
which
she
did
very
warmly,
and
evidently
hoping
to
interest
Fanny
on
her
side.
"It
was
very
hard
that
she
was
not
to
have
her
own
knife;
it
was
her
own
knife;
little
sister
Mary
had
left
it
to
her
upon
her
deathbed,
and
she
ought
to
have
had
it
to
keep
herself
long
ago.
But
mama
kept
it
from
her,
and
was
always
letting
Betsey
get
hold
of
it;
and
the
end
of
it
would
be
that
Betsey
would
spoil
it,
and
get
it
for
her
own,
though
mama
had
promised
her
that
Betsey
should
not
have
it
in
her
own
hands."
Fanny
was
quite
shocked.
Every
feeling
of
duty,
honour,
and
tenderness
was
wounded
by
her
sister's
speech
and
her
mother's
reply.
"Now,
Susan,"
cried
Mrs.
Price,
in
a
complaining
voice,
"now,
how
can
you
be
so
cross?
You
are
always
quarrelling
about
that
knife.
I
wish
you
would
not
be
so
quarrelsome.
Poor
little
Betsey;
how
cross
Susan
is
to
you!
But
you
should
not
have
taken
it
out,
my
dear,
when
I
sent
you
to
the
drawer.
You
know
I
told
you
not
to
touch
it,
because
Susan
is
so
cross
about
it.
I
must
hide
it
another
time,
Betsey.
Poor
Mary
little
thought
it
would
be
such
a
bone
of
contention
when
she
gave
it
me
to
keep,
only
two
hours
before
she
died.
Poor
little
soul!
she
could
but
just
speak
to
be
heard,
and
she
said
so
prettily,
'Let
sister
Susan
have
my
knife,
mama,
when
I
am
dead
and
buried.'
Poor
little
dear!
she
was
so
fond
of
it,
Fanny,
that
she
would
have
it
lay
by
her
in
bed,
all
through
her
illness.
It
was
the
gift
of
her
good
godmother,
old
Mrs.
Admiral
Maxwell,
only
six
weeks
before
she
was
taken
for
death.
Poor
little
sweet
creature!
Well,
she
was
taken
away
from
evil
to
come.
My
own
Betsey"
(fondling
her),
"you
have
not
the
luck
of
such
a
good
godmother.
Aunt
Norris
lives
too
far
off
to
think
of
such
little
people
as
you."
Fanny
had
indeed
nothing
to
convey
from
aunt
Norris,
but
a
message
to
say
she
hoped
that
her
god
daughter
was
a
good
girl,
and
learnt
her
book.
There
had
been
at
one
moment
a
slight
murmur
in
the
drawing
room
at
Mansfield
Park
about
sending
her
a
prayer
book;
but
no
second
sound
had
been
heard
of
such
a
purpose.
Mrs.
Norris,
however,
had
gone
home
and
taken
down
two
old
prayer
books
of
her
husband
with
that
idea;
but,
upon
examination,
the
ardour
of
generosity
went
off.
One
was
found
to
have
too
small
a
print
for
a
child's
eyes,
and
the
other
to
be
too
cumbersome
for
her
to
carry
about.
Fanny,
fatigued
and
fatigued
again,
was
thankful
to
accept
the
first
invitation
of
going
to
bed;
and
before
Betsey
had
finished
her
cry
at
being
allowed
to
sit
up
only
one
hour
extraordinary
in
honour
of
sister,
she
was
off,
leaving
all
below
in
confusion
and
noise
again;
the
boys
begging
for
toasted
cheese,
her
father
calling
out
for
his
rum
and
water,
and
Rebecca
never
where
she
ought
to
be.
There
was
nothing
to
raise
her
spirits
in
the
confined
and
scantily
furnished
chamber
that
she
was
to
share
with
Susan.
The
smallness
of
the
rooms
above
and
below,
indeed,
and
the
narrowness
of
the
passage
and
staircase,
struck
her
beyond
her
imagination.
She
soon
learned
to
think
with
respect
of
her
own
little
attic
at
Mansfield
Park,
in
that
house
reckoned
too
small
for
anybody's
comfort.
Could
Sir
Thomas
have
seen
all
his
niece's
feelings,
when
she
wrote
her
first
letter
to
her
aunt,
he
would
not
have
despaired;
for
though
a
good
night's
rest,
a
pleasant
morning,
the
hope
of
soon
seeing
William
again,
and
the
comparatively
quiet
state
of
the
house,
from
Tom
and
Charles
being
gone
to
school,
Sam
on
some
project
of
his
own,
and
her
father
on
his
usual
lounges,
enabled
her
to
express
herself
cheerfully
on
the
subject
of
home,
there
were
still,
to
her
own
perfect
consciousness,
many
drawbacks
suppressed.
Could
he
have
seen
only
half
that
she
felt
before
the
end
of
a
week,
he
would
have
thought
Mr.
Crawford
sure
of
her,
and
been
delighted
with
his
own
sagacity.
Before
the
week
ended,
it
was
all
disappointment.
In
the
first
place,
William
was
gone.
The
Thrush
had
had
her
orders,
the
wind
had
changed,
and
he
was
sailed
within
four
days
from
their
reaching
Portsmouth;
and
during
those
days
she
had
seen
him
only
twice,
in
a
short
and
hurried
way,
when
he
had
come
ashore
on
duty.
There
had
been
no
free
conversation,
no
walk
on
the
ramparts,
no
visit
to
the
dockyard,
no
acquaintance
with
the
Thrush,
nothing
of
all
that
they
had
planned
and
depended
on.
Everything
in
that
quarter
failed
her,
except
William's
affection.
His
last
thought
on
leaving
home
was
for
her.
He
stepped
back
again
to
the
door
to
say,
"Take
care
of
Fanny,
mother.
She
is
tender,
and
not
used
to
rough
it
like
the
rest
of
us.
I
charge
you,
take
care
of
Fanny."
William
was
gone:
and
the
home
he
had
left
her
in
was,
Fanny
could
not
conceal
it
from
herself,
in
almost
every
respect
the
very
reverse
of
what
she
could
have
wished.
It
was
the
abode
of
noise,
disorder,
and
impropriety.
Nobody
was
in
their
right
place,
nothing
was
done
as
it
ought
to
be.
She
could
not
respect
her
parents
as
she
had
hoped.
On
her
father,
her
confidence
had
not
been
sanguine,
but
he
was
more
negligent
of
his
family,
his
habits
were
worse,
and
his
manners
coarser,
than
she
had
been
prepared
for.
He
did
not
want
abilities
but
he
had
no
curiosity,
and
no
information
beyond
his
profession;
he
read
only
the
newspaper
and
the
navy
list;
he
talked
only
of
the
dockyard,
the
harbour,
Spithead,
and
the
Motherbank;
he
swore
and
he
drank,
he
was
dirty
and
gross.
She
had
never
been
able
to
recall
anything
approaching
to
tenderness
in
his
former
treatment
of
herself.
There
had
remained
only
a
general
impression
of
roughness
and
loudness;
and
now
he
scarcely
ever
noticed
her,
but
to
make
her
the
object
of
a
coarse
joke.
Her
disappointment
in
her
mother
was
greater:
there
she
had
hoped
much,
and
found
almost
nothing.
Every
flattering
scheme
of
being
of
consequence
to
her
soon
fell
to
the
ground.
Mrs.
Price
was
not
unkind;
but,
instead
of
gaining
on
her
affection
and
confidence,
and
becoming
more
and
more
dear,
her
daughter
never
met
with
greater
kindness
from
her
than
on
the
first
day
of
her
arrival.
The
instinct
of
nature
was
soon
satisfied,
and
Mrs.
Price's
attachment
had
no
other
source.
Her
heart
and
her
time
were
already
quite
full;
she
had
neither
leisure
nor
affection
to
bestow
on
Fanny.
Her
daughters
never
had
been
much
to
her.
She
was
fond
of
her
sons,
especially
of
William,
but
Betsey
was
the
first
of
her
girls
whom
she
had
ever
much
regarded.
To
her
she
was
most
injudiciously
indulgent.
William
was
her
pride;
Betsey
her
darling;
and
John,
Richard,
Sam,
Tom,
and
Charles
occupied
all
the
rest
of
her
maternal
solicitude,
alternately
her
worries
and
her
comforts.
These
shared
her
heart:
her
time
was
given
chiefly
to
her
house
and
her
servants.
Her
days
were
spent
in
a
kind
of
slow
bustle;
all
was
busy
without
getting
on,
always
behindhand
and
lamenting
it,
without
altering
her
ways;
wishing
to
be
an
economist,
without
contrivance
or
regularity;
dissatisfied
with
her
servants,
without
skill
to
make
them
better,
and
whether
helping,
or
reprimanding,
or
indulging
them,
without
any
power
of
engaging
their
respect.
Of
her
two
sisters,
Mrs.
Price
very
much
more
resembled
Lady
Bertram
than
Mrs.
Norris.
She
was
a
manager
by
necessity,
without
any
of
Mrs.
Norris's
inclination
for
it,
or
any
of
her
activity.
Her
disposition
was
naturally
easy
and
indolent,
like
Lady
Bertram's;
and
a
situation
of
similar
affluence
and
do
nothingness
would
have
been
much
more
suited
to
her
capacity
than
the
exertions
and
self
denials
of
the
one
which
her
imprudent
marriage
had
placed
her
in.
She
might
have
made
just
as
good
a
woman
of
consequence
as
Lady
Bertram,
but
Mrs.
Norris
would
have
been
a
more
respectable
mother
of
nine
children
on
a
small
income.
Much
of
all
this
Fanny
could
not
but
be
sensible
of.
She
might
scruple
to
make
use
of
the
words,
but
she
must
and
did
feel
that
her
mother
was
a
partial,
ill
judging
parent,
a
dawdle,
a
slattern,
who
neither
taught
nor
restrained
her
children,
whose
house
was
the
scene
of
mismanagement
and
discomfort
from
beginning
to
end,
and
who
had
no
talent,
no
conversation,
no
affection
towards
herself;
no
curiosity
to
know
her
better,
no
desire
of
her
friendship,
and
no
inclination
for
her
company
that
could
lessen
her
sense
of
such
feelings.
Fanny
was
very
anxious
to
be
useful,
and
not
to
appear
above
her
home,
or
in
any
way
disqualified
or
disinclined,
by
her
foreign
education,
from
contributing
her
help
to
its
comforts,
and
therefore
set
about
working
for
Sam
immediately;
and
by
working
early
and
late,
with
perseverance
and
great
despatch,
did
so
much
that
the
boy
was
shipped
off
at
last,
with
more
than
half
his
linen
ready.
She
had
great
pleasure
in
feeling
her
usefulness,
but
could
not
conceive
how
they
would
have
managed
without
her.
Sam,
loud
and
overbearing
as
he
was,
she
rather
regretted
when
he
went,
for
he
was
clever
and
intelligent,
and
glad
to
be
employed
in
any
errand
in
the
town;
and
though
spurning
the
remonstrances
of
Susan,
given
as
they
were,
though
very
reasonable
in
themselves,
with
ill
timed
and
powerless
warmth,
was
beginning
to
be
influenced
by
Fanny's
services
and
gentle
persuasions;
and
she
found
that
the
best
of
the
three
younger
ones
was
gone
in
him:
Tom
and
Charles
being
at
least
as
many
years
as
they
were
his
juniors
distant
from
that
age
of
feeling
and
reason,
which
might
suggest
the
expediency
of
making
friends,
and
of
endeavouring
to
be
less
disagreeable.
Their
sister
soon
despaired
of
making
the
smallest
impression
on
them;
they
were
quite
untameable
by
any
means
of
address
which
she
had
spirits
or
time
to
attempt.
Every
afternoon
brought
a
return
of
their
riotous
games
all
over
the
house;
and
she
very
early
learned
to
sigh
at
the
approach
of
Saturday's
constant
half
holiday.
Betsey,
too,
a
spoiled
child,
trained
up
to
think
the
alphabet
her
greatest
enemy,
left
to
be
with
the
servants
at
her
pleasure,
and
then
encouraged
to
report
any
evil
of
them,
she
was
almost
as
ready
to
despair
of
being
able
to
love
or
assist;
and
of
Susan's
temper
she
had
many
doubts.
Her
continual
disagreements
with
her
mother,
her
rash
squabbles
with
Tom
and
Charles,
and
petulance
with
Betsey,
were
at
least
so
distressing
to
Fanny
that,
though
admitting
they
were
by
no
means
without
provocation,
she
feared
the
disposition
that
could
push
them
to
such
length
must
be
far
from
amiable,
and
from
affording
any
repose
to
herself.
Such
was
the
home
which
was
to
put
Mansfield
out
of
her
head,
and
teach
her
to
think
of
her
cousin
Edmund
with
moderated
feelings.
On
the
contrary,
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
Mansfield,
its
beloved
inmates,
its
happy
ways.
Everything
where
she
now
was
in
full
contrast
to
it.
The
elegance,
propriety,
regularity,
harmony,
and
perhaps,
above
all,
the
peace
and
tranquillity
of
Mansfield,
were
brought
to
her
remembrance
every
hour
of
the
day,
by
the
prevalence
of
everything
opposite
to
them
here.
The
living
in
incessant
noise
was,
to
a
frame
and
temper
delicate
and
nervous
like
Fanny's,
an
evil
which
no
superadded
elegance
or
harmony
could
have
entirely
atoned
for.
It
was
the
greatest
misery
of
all.
At
Mansfield,
no
sounds
of
contention,
no
raised
voice,
no
abrupt
bursts,
no
tread
of
violence,
was
ever
heard;
all
proceeded
in
a
regular
course
of
cheerful
orderliness;
everybody
had
their
due
importance;
everybody's
feelings
were
consulted.
If
tenderness
could
be
ever
supposed
wanting,
good
sense
and
good
breeding
supplied
its
place;
and
as
to
the
little
irritations
sometimes
introduced
by
aunt
Norris,
they
were
short,
they
were
trifling,
they
were
as
a
drop
of
water
to
the
ocean,
compared
with
the
ceaseless
tumult
of
her
present
abode.
Here
everybody
was
noisy,
every
voice
was
loud
(excepting,
perhaps,
her
mother's,
which
resembled
the
soft
monotony
of
Lady
Bertram's,
only
worn
into
fretfulness).
Whatever
was
wanted
was
hallooed
for,
and
the
servants
hallooed
out
their
excuses
from
the
kitchen.
The
doors
were
in
constant
banging,
the
stairs
were
never
at
rest,
nothing
was
done
without
a
clatter,
nobody
sat
still,
and
nobody
could
command
attention
when
they
spoke.
In
a
review
of
the
two
houses,
as
they
appeared
to
her
before
the
end
of
a
week,
Fanny
was
tempted
to
apply
to
them
Dr.
Johnson's
celebrated
judgment
as
to
matrimony
and
celibacy,
and
say,
that
though
Mansfield
Park
might
have
some
pains,
Portsmouth
could
have
no
pleasures.
Fanny
was
right
enough
in
not
expecting
to
hear
from
Miss
Crawford
now
at
the
rapid
rate
in
which
their
correspondence
had
begun;
Mary's
next
letter
was
after
a
decidedly
longer
interval
than
the
last,
but
she
was
not
right
in
supposing
that
such
an
interval
would
be
felt
a
great
relief
to
herself.
Here
was
another
strange
revolution
of
mind!
She
was
really
glad
to
receive
the
letter
when
it
did
come.
In
her
present
exile
from
good
society,
and
distance
from
everything
that
had
been
wont
to
interest
her,
a
letter
from
one
belonging
to
the
set
where
her
heart
lived,
written
with
affection,
and
some
degree
of
elegance,
was
thoroughly
acceptable.
The
usual
plea
of
increasing
engagements
was
made
in
excuse
for
not
having
written
to
her
earlier;
"And
now
that
I
have
begun,"
she
continued,
"my
letter
will
not
be
worth
your
reading,
for
there
will
be
no
little
offering
of
love
at
the
end,
no
three
or
four
lines
passionnees
from
the
most
devoted
H.
C.
in
the
world,
for
Henry
is
in
Norfolk;
business
called
him
to
Everingham
ten
days
ago,
or
perhaps
he
only
pretended
to
call,
for
the
sake
of
being
travelling
at
the
same
time
that
you
were.
But
there
he
is,
and,
by
the
bye,
his
absence
may
sufficiently
account
for
any
remissness
of
his
sister's
in
writing,
for
there
has
been
no
'Well,
Mary,
when
do
you
write
to
Fanny?
Is
not
it
time
for
you
to
write
to
Fanny?'
to
spur
me
on.
At
last,
after
various
attempts
at
meeting,
I
have
seen
your
cousins,
'dear
Julia
and
dearest
Mrs.
Rushworth';
they
found
me
at
home
yesterday,
and
we
were
glad
to
see
each
other
again.
We
seemed
very
glad
to
see
each
other,
and
I
do
really
think
we
were
a
little.
We
had
a
vast
deal
to
say.
Shall
I
tell
you
how
Mrs.
Rushworth
looked
when
your
name
was
mentioned?
I
did
not
use
to
think
her
wanting
in
self
possession,
but
she
had
not
quite
enough
for
the
demands
of
yesterday.
Upon
the
whole,
Julia
was
in
the
best
looks
of
the
two,
at
least
after
you
were
spoken
of.
There
was
no
recovering
the
complexion
from
the
moment
that
I
spoke
of
'Fanny,'
and
spoke
of
her
as
a
sister
should.
But
Mrs.
Rushworth's
day
of
good
looks
will
come;
we
have
cards
for
her
first
party
on
the
28th.
Then
she
will
be
in
beauty,
for
she
will
open
one
of
the
best
houses
in
Wimpole
Street.
I
was
in
it
two
years
ago,
when
it
was
Lady
Lascelle's,
and
prefer
it
to
almost
any
I
know
in
London,
and
certainly
she
will
then
feel,
to
use
a
vulgar
phrase,
that
she
has
got
her
pennyworth
for
her
penny.
Henry
could
not
have
afforded
her
such
a
house.
I
hope
she
will
recollect
it,
and
be
satisfied,
as
well
as
she
may,
with
moving
the
queen
of
a
palace,
though
the
king
may
appear
best
in
the
background;
and
as
I
have
no
desire
to
tease
her,
I
shall
never
force
your
name
upon
her
again.
She
will
grow
sober
by
degrees.
From
all
that
I
hear
and
guess,
Baron
Wildenheim's
attentions
to
Julia
continue,
but
I
do
not
know
that
he
has
any
serious
encouragement.
She
ought
to
do
better.
A
poor
honourable
is
no
catch,
and
I
cannot
imagine
any
liking
in
the
case,
for
take
away
his
rants,
and
the
poor
baron
has
nothing.
What
a
difference
a
vowel
makes!
If
his
rents
were
but
equal
to
his
rants!
Your
cousin
Edmund
moves
slowly;
detained,
perchance,
by
parish
duties.
There
may
be
some
old
woman
at
Thornton
Lacey
to
be
converted.
I
am
unwilling
to
fancy
myself
neglected
for
a
young
one.
Adieu!
my
dear
sweet
Fanny,
this
is
a
long
letter
from
London:
write
me
a
pretty
one
in
reply
to
gladden
Henry's
eyes,
when
he
comes
back,
and
send
me
an
account
of
all
the
dashing
young
captains
whom
you
disdain
for
his
sake."
There
was
great
food
for
meditation
in
this
letter,
and
chiefly
for
unpleasant
meditation;
and
yet,
with
all
the
uneasiness
it
supplied,
it
connected
her
with
the
absent,
it
told
her
of
people
and
things
about
whom
she
had
never
felt
so
much
curiosity
as
now,
and
she
would
have
been
glad
to
have
been
sure
of
such
a
letter
every
week.
Her
correspondence
with
her
aunt
Bertram
was
her
only
concern
of
higher
interest.
As
for
any
society
in
Portsmouth,
that
could
at
all
make
amends
for
deficiencies
at
home,
there
were
none
within
the
circle
of
her
father's
and
mother's
acquaintance
to
afford
her
the
smallest
satisfaction:
she
saw
nobody
in
whose
favour
she
could
wish
to
overcome
her
own
shyness
and
reserve.
The
men
appeared
to
her
all
coarse,
the
women
all
pert,
everybody
underbred;
and
she
gave
as
little
contentment
as
she
received
from
introductions
either
to
old
or
new
acquaintance.
The
young
ladies
who
approached
her
at
first
with
some
respect,
in
consideration
of
her
coming
from
a
baronet's
family,
were
soon
offended
by
what
they
termed
"airs";
for,
as
she
neither
played
on
the
pianoforte
nor
wore
fine
pelisses,
they
could,
on
farther
observation,
admit
no
right
of
superiority.
The
first
solid
consolation
which
Fanny
received
for
the
evils
of
home,
the
first
which
her
judgment
could
entirely
approve,
and
which
gave
any
promise
of
durability,
was
in
a
better
knowledge
of
Susan,
and
a
hope
of
being
of
service
to
her.
Susan
had
always
behaved
pleasantly
to
herself,
but
the
determined
character
of
her
general
manners
had
astonished
and
alarmed
her,
and
it
was
at
least
a
fortnight
before
she
began
to
understand
a
disposition
so
totally
different
from
her
own.
Susan
saw
that
much
was
wrong
at
home,
and
wanted
to
set
it
right.
That
a
girl
of
fourteen,
acting
only
on
her
own
unassisted
reason,
should
err
in
the
method
of
reform,
was
not
wonderful;
and
Fanny
soon
became
more
disposed
to
admire
the
natural
light
of
the
mind
which
could
so
early
distinguish
justly,
than
to
censure
severely
the
faults
of
conduct
to
which
it
led.
Susan
was
only
acting
on
the
same
truths,
and
pursuing
the
same
system,
which
her
own
judgment
acknowledged,
but
which
her
more
supine
and
yielding
temper
would
have
shrunk
from
asserting.
Susan
tried
to
be
useful,
where
she
could
only
have
gone
away
and
cried;
and
that
Susan
was
useful
she
could
perceive;
that
things,
bad
as
they
were,
would
have
been
worse
but
for
such
interposition,
and
that
both
her
mother
and
Betsey
were
restrained
from
some
excesses
of
very
offensive
indulgence
and
vulgarity.
In
every
argument
with
her
mother,
Susan
had
in
point
of
reason
the
advantage,
and
never
was
there
any
maternal
tenderness
to
buy
her
off.
The
blind
fondness
which
was
for
ever
producing
evil
around
her
she
had
never
known.
There
was
no
gratitude
for
affection
past
or
present
to
make
her
better
bear
with
its
excesses
to
the
others.
All
this
became
gradually
evident,
and
gradually
placed
Susan
before
her
sister
as
an
object
of
mingled
compassion
and
respect.
That
her
manner
was
wrong,
however,
at
times
very
wrong,
her
measures
often
ill
chosen
and
ill
timed,
and
her
looks
and
language
very
often
indefensible,
Fanny
could
not
cease
to
feel;
but
she
began
to
hope
they
might
be
rectified.
Susan,
she
found,
looked
up
to
her
and
wished
for
her
good
opinion;
and
new
as
anything
like
an
office
of
authority
was
to
Fanny,
new
as
it
was
to
imagine
herself
capable
of
guiding
or
informing
any
one,
she
did
resolve
to
give
occasional
hints
to
Susan,
and
endeavour
to
exercise
for
her
advantage
the
juster
notions
of
what
was
due
to
everybody,
and
what
would
be
wisest
for
herself,
which
her
own
more
favoured
education
had
fixed
in
her.
Her
influence,
or
at
least
the
consciousness
and
use
of
it,
originated
in
an
act
of
kindness
by
Susan,
which,
after
many
hesitations
of
delicacy,
she
at
last
worked
herself
up
to.
It
had
very
early
occurred
to
her
that
a
small
sum
of
money
might,
perhaps,
restore
peace
for
ever
on
the
sore
subject
of
the
silver
knife,
canvassed
as
it
now
was
continually,
and
the
riches
which
she
was
in
possession
of
herself,
her
uncle
having
given
her
10
pounds
at
parting,
made
her
as
able
as
she
was
willing
to
be
generous.
But
she
was
so
wholly
unused
to
confer
favours,
except
on
the
very
poor,
so
unpractised
in
removing
evils,
or
bestowing
kindnesses
among
her
equals,
and
so
fearful
of
appearing
to
elevate
herself
as
a
great
lady
at
home,
that
it
took
some
time
to
determine
that
it
would
not
be
unbecoming
in
her
to
make
such
a
present.
It
was
made,
however,
at
last:
a
silver
knife
was
bought
for
Betsey,
and
accepted
with
great
delight,
its
newness
giving
it
every
advantage
over
the
other
that
could
be
desired;
Susan
was
established
in
the
full
possession
of
her
own,
Betsey
handsomely
declaring
that
now
she
had
got
one
so
much
prettier
herself,
she
should
never
want
that
again;
and
no
reproach
seemed
conveyed
to
the
equally
satisfied
mother,
which
Fanny
had
almost
feared
to
be
impossible.
The
deed
thoroughly
answered:
a
source
of
domestic
altercation
was
entirely
done
away,
and
it
was
the
means
of
opening
Susan's
heart
to
her,
and
giving
her
something
more
to
love
and
be
interested
in.
Susan
shewed
that
she
had
delicacy:
pleased
as
she
was
to
be
mistress
of
property
which
she
had
been
struggling
for
at
least
two
years,
she
yet
feared
that
her
sister's
judgment
had
been
against
her,
and
that
a
reproof
was
designed
her
for
having
so
struggled
as
to
make
the
purchase
necessary
for
the
tranquillity
of
the
house.
Her
temper
was
open.
She
acknowledged
her
fears,
blamed
herself
for
having
contended
so
warmly;
and
from
that
hour
Fanny,
understanding
the
worth
of
her
disposition
and
perceiving
how
fully
she
was
inclined
to
seek
her
good
opinion
and
refer
to
her
judgment,
began
to
feel
again
the
blessing
of
affection,
and
to
entertain
the
hope
of
being
useful
to
a
mind
so
much
in
need
of
help,
and
so
much
deserving
it.
She
gave
advice,
advice
too
sound
to
be
resisted
by
a
good
understanding,
and
given
so
mildly
and
considerately
as
not
to
irritate
an
imperfect
temper,
and
she
had
the
happiness
of
observing
its
good
effects
not
unfrequently.
More
was
not
expected
by
one
who,
while
seeing
all
the
obligation
and
expediency
of
submission
and
forbearance,
saw
also
with
sympathetic
acuteness
of
feeling
all
that
must
be
hourly
grating
to
a
girl
like
Susan.
Her
greatest
wonder
on
the
subject
soon
became
not
that
Susan
should
have
been
provoked
into
disrespect
and
impatience
against
her
better
knowledge
but
that
so
much
better
knowledge,
so
many
good
notions
should
have
been
hers
at
all;
and
that,
brought
up
in
the
midst
of
negligence
and
error,
she
should
have
formed
such
proper
opinions
of
what
ought
to
be;
she,
who
had
had
no
cousin
Edmund
to
direct
her
thoughts
or
fix
her
principles.
The
intimacy
thus
begun
between
them
was
a
material
advantage
to
each.
By
sitting
together
upstairs,
they
avoided
a
great
deal
of
the
disturbance
of
the
house;
Fanny
had
peace,
and
Susan
learned
to
think
it
no
misfortune
to
be
quietly
employed.
They
sat
without
a
fire;
but
that
was
a
privation
familiar
even
to
Fanny,
and
she
suffered
the
less
because
reminded
by
it
of
the
East
room.
It
was
the
only
point
of
resemblance.
In
space,
light,
furniture,
and
prospect,
there
was
nothing
alike
in
the
two
apartments;
and
she
often
heaved
a
sigh
at
the
remembrance
of
all
her
books
and
boxes,
and
various
comforts
there.
By
degrees
the
girls
came
to
spend
the
chief
of
the
morning
upstairs,
at
first
only
in
working
and
talking,
but
after
a
few
days,
the
remembrance
of
the
said
books
grew
so
potent
and
stimulative
that
Fanny
found
it
impossible
not
to
try
for
books
again.
There
were
none
in
her
father's
house;
but
wealth
is
luxurious
and
daring,
and
some
of
hers
found
its
way
to
a
circulating
library.
She
became
a
subscriber;
amazed
at
being
anything
in
propria
persona,
amazed
at
her
own
doings
in
every
way,
to
be
a
renter,
a
chuser
of
books!
And
to
be
having
any
one's
improvement
in
view
in
her
choice!
But
so
it
was.
Susan
had
read
nothing,
and
Fanny
longed
to
give
her
a
share
in
her
own
first
pleasures,
and
inspire
a
taste
for
the
biography
and
poetry
which
she
delighted
in
herself.
In
this
occupation
she
hoped,
moreover,
to
bury
some
of
the
recollections
of
Mansfield,
which
were
too
apt
to
seize
her
mind
if
her
fingers
only
were
busy;
and,
especially
at
this
time,
hoped
it
might
be
useful
in
diverting
her
thoughts
from
pursuing
Edmund
to
London,
whither,
on
the
authority
of
her
aunt's
last
letter,
she
knew
he
was
gone.
She
had
no
doubt
of
what
would
ensue.
The
promised
notification
was
hanging
over
her
head.
The
postman's
knock
within
the
neighbourhood
was
beginning
to
bring
its
daily
terrors,
and
if
reading
could
banish
the
idea
for
even
half
an
hour,
it
was
something
gained.
A
week
was
gone
since
Edmund
might
be
supposed
in
town,
and
Fanny
had
heard
nothing
of
him.
There
were
three
different
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
his
silence,
between
which
her
mind
was
in
fluctuation;
each
of
them
at
times
being
held
the
most
probable.
Either
his
going
had
been
again
delayed,
or
he
had
yet
procured
no
opportunity
of
seeing
Miss
Crawford
alone,
or
he
was
too
happy
for
letter
writing!
One
morning,
about
this
time,
Fanny
having
now
been
nearly
four
weeks
from
Mansfield,
a
point
which
she
never
failed
to
think
over
and
calculate
every
day,
as
she
and
Susan
were
preparing
to
remove,
as
usual,
upstairs,
they
were
stopped
by
the
knock
of
a
visitor,
whom
they
felt
they
could
not
avoid,
from
Rebecca's
alertness
in
going
to
the
door,
a
duty
which
always
interested
her
beyond
any
other.
It
was
a
gentleman's
voice;
it
was
a
voice
that
Fanny
was
just
turning
pale
about,
when
Mr.
Crawford
walked
into
the
room.
Good
sense,
like
hers,
will
always
act
when
really
called
upon;
and
she
found
that
she
had
been
able
to
name
him
to
her
mother,
and
recall
her
remembrance
of
the
name,
as
that
of
"William's
friend,"
though
she
could
not
previously
have
believed
herself
capable
of
uttering
a
syllable
at
such
a
moment.
The
consciousness
of
his
being
known
there
only
as
William's
friend
was
some
support.
Having
introduced
him,
however,
and
being
all
reseated,
the
terrors
that
occurred
of
what
this
visit
might
lead
to
were
overpowering,
and
she
fancied
herself
on
the
point
of
fainting
away.
While
trying
to
keep
herself
alive,
their
visitor,
who
had
at
first
approached
her
with
as
animated
a
countenance
as
ever,
was
wisely
and
kindly
keeping
his
eyes
away,
and
giving
her
time
to
recover,
while
he
devoted
himself
entirely
to
her
mother,
addressing
her,
and
attending
to
her
with
the
utmost
politeness
and
propriety,
at
the
same
time
with
a
degree
of
friendliness,
of
interest
at
least,
which
was
making
his
manner
perfect.
Mrs.
Price's
manners
were
also
at
their
best.
Warmed
by
the
sight
of
such
a
friend
to
her
son,
and
regulated
by
the
wish
of
appearing
to
advantage
before
him,
she
was
overflowing
with
gratitude
artless,
maternal
gratitude
which
could
not
be
unpleasing.
Mr.
Price
was
out,
which
she
regretted
very
much.
Fanny
was
just
recovered
enough
to
feel
that
she
could
not
regret
it;
for
to
her
many
other
sources
of
uneasiness
was
added
the
severe
one
of
shame
for
the
home
in
which
he
found
her.
She
might
scold
herself
for
the
weakness,
but
there
was
no
scolding
it
away.
She
was
ashamed,
and
she
would
have
been
yet
more
ashamed
of
her
father
than
of
all
the
rest.
They
talked
of
William,
a
subject
on
which
Mrs.
Price
could
never
tire;
and
Mr.
Crawford
was
as
warm
in
his
commendation
as
even
her
heart
could
wish.
She
felt
that
she
had
never
seen
so
agreeable
a
man
in
her
life;
and
was
only
astonished
to
find
that,
so
great
and
so
agreeable
as
he
was,
he
should
be
come
down
to
Portsmouth
neither
on
a
visit
to
the
port
admiral,
nor
the
commissioner,
nor
yet
with
the
intention
of
going
over
to
the
island,
nor
of
seeing
the
dockyard.
Nothing
of
all
that
she
had
been
used
to
think
of
as
the
proof
of
importance,
or
the
employment
of
wealth,
had
brought
him
to
Portsmouth.
He
had
reached
it
late
the
night
before,
was
come
for
a
day
or
two,
was
staying
at
the
Crown,
had
accidentally
met
with
a
navy
officer
or
two
of
his
acquaintance
since
his
arrival,
but
had
no
object
of
that
kind
in
coming.
By
the
time
he
had
given
all
this
information,
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
Fanny
might
be
looked
at
and
spoken
to;
and
she
was
tolerably
able
to
bear
his
eye,
and
hear
that
he
had
spent
half
an
hour
with
his
sister
the
evening
before
his
leaving
London;
that
she
had
sent
her
best
and
kindest
love,
but
had
had
no
time
for
writing;
that
he
thought
himself
lucky
in
seeing
Mary
for
even
half
an
hour,
having
spent
scarcely
twenty
four
hours
in
London,
after
his
return
from
Norfolk,
before
he
set
off
again;
that
her
cousin
Edmund
was
in
town,
had
been
in
town,
he
understood,
a
few
days;
that
he
had
not
seen
him
himself,
but
that
he
was
well,
had
left
them
all
well
at
Mansfield,
and
was
to
dine,
as
yesterday,
with
the
Frasers.
Fanny
listened
collectedly,
even
to
the
last
mentioned
circumstance;
nay,
it
seemed
a
relief
to
her
worn
mind
to
be
at
any
certainty;
and
the
words,
"then
by
this
time
it
is
all
settled,"
passed
internally,
without
more
evidence
of
emotion
than
a
faint
blush.
After
talking
a
little
more
about
Mansfield,
a
subject
in
which
her
interest
was
most
apparent,
Crawford
began
to
hint
at
the
expediency
of
an
early
walk.
"It
was
a
lovely
morning,
and
at
that
season
of
the
year
a
fine
morning
so
often
turned
off,
that
it
was
wisest
for
everybody
not
to
delay
their
exercise";
and
such
hints
producing
nothing,
he
soon
proceeded
to
a
positive
recommendation
to
Mrs.
Price
and
her
daughters
to
take
their
walk
without
loss
of
time.
Now
they
came
to
an
understanding.
Mrs.
Price,
it
appeared,
scarcely
ever
stirred
out
of
doors,
except
of
a
Sunday;
she
owned
she
could
seldom,
with
her
large
family,
find
time
for
a
walk.
"Would
she
not,
then,
persuade
her
daughters
to
take
advantage
of
such
weather,
and
allow
him
the
pleasure
of
attending
them?"
Mrs.
Price
was
greatly
obliged
and
very
complying.
"Her
daughters
were
very
much
confined;
Portsmouth
was
a
sad
place;
they
did
not
often
get
out;
and
she
knew
they
had
some
errands
in
the
town,
which
they
would
be
very
glad
to
do."
And
the
consequence
was,
that
Fanny,
strange
as
it
was
strange,
awkward,
and
distressing
found
herself
and
Susan,
within
ten
minutes,
walking
towards
the
High
Street
with
Mr.
Crawford.
It
was
soon
pain
upon
pain,
confusion
upon
confusion;
for
they
were
hardly
in
the
High
Street
before
they
met
her
father,
whose
appearance
was
not
the
better
from
its
being
Saturday.
He
stopt;
and,
ungentlemanlike
as
he
looked,
Fanny
was
obliged
to
introduce
him
to
Mr.
Crawford.
She
could
not
have
a
doubt
of
the
manner
in
which
Mr.
Crawford
must
be
struck.
He
must
be
ashamed
and
disgusted
altogether.
He
must
soon
give
her
up,
and
cease
to
have
the
smallest
inclination
for
the
match;
and
yet,
though
she
had
been
so
much
wanting
his
affection
to
be
cured,
this
was
a
sort
of
cure
that
would
be
almost
as
bad
as
the
complaint;
and
I
believe
there
is
scarcely
a
young
lady
in
the
United
Kingdoms
who
would
not
rather
put
up
with
the
misfortune
of
being
sought
by
a
clever,
agreeable
man,
than
have
him
driven
away
by
the
vulgarity
of
her
nearest
relations.
Mr.
Crawford
probably
could
not
regard
his
future
father
in
law
with
any
idea
of
taking
him
for
a
model
in
dress;
but
(as
Fanny
instantly,
and
to
her
great
relief,
discerned)
her
father
was
a
very
different
man,
a
very
different
Mr.
Price
in
his
behaviour
to
this
most
highly
respected
stranger,
from
what
he
was
in
his
own
family
at
home.
His
manners
now,
though
not
polished,
were
more
than
passable:
they
were
grateful,
animated,
manly;
his
expressions
were
those
of
an
attached
father,
and
a
sensible
man;
his
loud
tones
did
very
well
in
the
open
air,
and
there
was
not
a
single
oath
to
be
heard.
Such
was
his
instinctive
compliment
to
the
good
manners
of
Mr.
Crawford;
and,
be
the
consequence
what
it
might,
Fanny's
immediate
feelings
were
infinitely
soothed.
The
conclusion
of
the
two
gentlemen's
civilities
was
an
offer
of
Mr.
Price's
to
take
Mr.
Crawford
into
the
dockyard,
which
Mr.
Crawford,
desirous
of
accepting
as
a
favour
what
was
intended
as
such,
though
he
had
seen
the
dockyard
again
and
again,
and
hoping
to
be
so
much
the
longer
with
Fanny,
was
very
gratefully
disposed
to
avail
himself
of,
if
the
Miss
Prices
were
not
afraid
of
the
fatigue;
and
as
it
was
somehow
or
other
ascertained,
or
inferred,
or
at
least
acted
upon,
that
they
were
not
at
all
afraid,
to
the
dockyard
they
were
all
to
go;
and
but
for
Mr.
Crawford,
Mr.
Price
would
have
turned
thither
directly,
without
the
smallest
consideration
for
his
daughters'
errands
in
the
High
Street.
He
took
care,
however,
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
go
to
the
shops
they
came
out
expressly
to
visit;
and
it
did
not
delay
them
long,
for
Fanny
could
so
little
bear
to
excite
impatience,
or
be
waited
for,
that
before
the
gentlemen,
as
they
stood
at
the
door,
could
do
more
than
begin
upon
the
last
naval
regulations,
or
settle
the
number
of
three
deckers
now
in
commission,
their
companions
were
ready
to
proceed.
They
were
then
to
set
forward
for
the
dockyard
at
once,
and
the
walk
would
have
been
conducted
according
to
Mr.
Crawford's
opinion
in
a
singular
manner,
had
Mr.
Price
been
allowed
the
entire
regulation
of
it,
as
the
two
girls,
he
found,
would
have
been
left
to
follow,
and
keep
up
with
them
or
not,
as
they
could,
while
they
walked
on
together
at
their
own
hasty
pace.
He
was
able
to
introduce
some
improvement
occasionally,
though
by
no
means
to
the
extent
he
wished;
he
absolutely
would
not
walk
away
from
them;
and
at
any
crossing
or
any
crowd,
when
Mr.
Price
was
only
calling
out,
"Come,
girls;
come,
Fan;
come,
Sue,
take
care
of
yourselves;
keep
a
sharp
lookout!"
he
would
give
them
his
particular
attendance.
Once
fairly
in
the
dockyard,
he
began
to
reckon
upon
some
happy
intercourse
with
Fanny,
as
they
were
very
soon
joined
by
a
brother
lounger
of
Mr.
Price's,
who
was
come
to
take
his
daily
survey
of
how
things
went
on,
and
who
must
prove
a
far
more
worthy
companion
than
himself;
and
after
a
time
the
two
officers
seemed
very
well
satisfied
going
about
together,
and
discussing
matters
of
equal
and
never
failing
interest,
while
the
young
people
sat
down
upon
some
timbers
in
the
yard,
or
found
a
seat
on
board
a
vessel
in
the
stocks
which
they
all
went
to
look
at.
Fanny
was
most
conveniently
in
want
of
rest.
Crawford
could
not
have
wished
her
more
fatigued
or
more
ready
to
sit
down;
but
he
could
have
wished
her
sister
away.
A
quick
looking
girl
of
Susan's
age
was
the
very
worst
third
in
the
world:
totally
different
from
Lady
Bertram,
all
eyes
and
ears;
and
there
was
no
introducing
the
main
point
before
her.
He
must
content
himself
with
being
only
generally
agreeable,
and
letting
Susan
have
her
share
of
entertainment,
with
the
indulgence,
now
and
then,
of
a
look
or
hint
for
the
better
informed
and
conscious
Fanny.
Norfolk
was
what
he
had
mostly
to
talk
of:
there
he
had
been
some
time,
and
everything
there
was
rising
in
importance
from
his
present
schemes.
Such
a
man
could
come
from
no
place,
no
society,
without
importing
something
to
amuse;
his
journeys
and
his
acquaintance
were
all
of
use,
and
Susan
was
entertained
in
a
way
quite
new
to
her.
For
Fanny,
somewhat
more
was
related
than
the
accidental
agreeableness
of
the
parties
he
had
been
in.
For
her
approbation,
the
particular
reason
of
his
going
into
Norfolk
at
all,
at
this
unusual
time
of
year,
was
given.
It
had
been
real
business,
relative
to
the
renewal
of
a
lease
in
which
the
welfare
of
a
large
and
he
believed
industrious
family
was
at
stake.
He
had
suspected
his
agent
of
some
underhand
dealing;
of
meaning
to
bias
him
against
the
deserving;
and
he
had
determined
to
go
himself,
and
thoroughly
investigate
the
merits
of
the
case.
He
had
gone,
had
done
even
more
good
than
he
had
foreseen,
had
been
useful
to
more
than
his
first
plan
had
comprehended,
and
was
now
able
to
congratulate
himself
upon
it,
and
to
feel
that
in
performing
a
duty,
he
had
secured
agreeable
recollections
for
his
own
mind.
He
had
introduced
himself
to
some
tenants
whom
he
had
never
seen
before;
he
had
begun
making
acquaintance
with
cottages
whose
very
existence,
though
on
his
own
estate,
had
been
hitherto
unknown
to
him.
This
was
aimed,
and
well
aimed,
at
Fanny.
It
was
pleasing
to
hear
him
speak
so
properly;
here
he
had
been
acting
as
he
ought
to
do.
To
be
the
friend
of
the
poor
and
the
oppressed!
Nothing
could
be
more
grateful
to
her;
and
she
was
on
the
point
of
giving
him
an
approving
look,
when
it
was
all
frightened
off
by
his
adding
a
something
too
pointed
of
his
hoping
soon
to
have
an
assistant,
a
friend,
a
guide
in
every
plan
of
utility
or
charity
for
Everingham:
a
somebody
that
would
make
Everingham
and
all
about
it
a
dearer
object
than
it
had
ever
been
yet.
She
turned
away,
and
wished
he
would
not
say
such
things.
She
was
willing
to
allow
he
might
have
more
good
qualities
than
she
had
been
wont
to
suppose.
She
began
to
feel
the
possibility
of
his
turning
out
well
at
last;
but
he
was
and
must
ever
be
completely
unsuited
to
her,
and
ought
not
to
think
of
her.
He
perceived
that
enough
had
been
said
of
Everingham,
and
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
talk
of
something
else,
and
turned
to
Mansfield.
He
could
not
have
chosen
better;
that
was
a
topic
to
bring
back
her
attention
and
her
looks
almost
instantly.
It
was
a
real
indulgence
to
her
to
hear
or
to
speak
of
Mansfield.
Now
so
long
divided
from
everybody
who
knew
the
place,
she
felt
it
quite
the
voice
of
a
friend
when
he
mentioned
it,
and
led
the
way
to
her
fond
exclamations
in
praise
of
its
beauties
and
comforts,
and
by
his
honourable
tribute
to
its
inhabitants
allowed
her
to
gratify
her
own
heart
in
the
warmest
eulogium,
in
speaking
of
her
uncle
as
all
that
was
clever
and
good,
and
her
aunt
as
having
the
sweetest
of
all
sweet
tempers.
He
had
a
great
attachment
to
Mansfield
himself;
he
said
so;
he
looked
forward
with
the
hope
of
spending
much,
very
much,
of
his
time
there;
always
there,
or
in
the
neighbourhood.
He
particularly
built
upon
a
very
happy
summer
and
autumn
there
this
year;
he
felt
that
it
would
be
so:
he
depended
upon
it;
a
summer
and
autumn
infinitely
superior
to
the
last.
As
animated,
as
diversified,
as
social,
but
with
circumstances
of
superiority
undescribable.
"Mansfield,
Sotherton,
Thornton
Lacey,"
he
continued;
"what
a
society
will
be
comprised
in
those
houses!
And
at
Michaelmas,
perhaps,
a
fourth
may
be
added:
some
small
hunting
box
in
the
vicinity
of
everything
so
dear;
for
as
to
any
partnership
in
Thornton
Lacey,
as
Edmund
Bertram
once
good
humouredly
proposed,
I
hope
I
foresee
two
objections:
two
fair,
excellent,
irresistible
objections
to
that
plan."
Fanny
was
doubly
silenced
here;
though
when
the
moment
was
passed,
could
regret
that
she
had
not
forced
herself
into
the
acknowledged
comprehension
of
one
half
of
his
meaning,
and
encouraged
him
to
say
something
more
of
his
sister
and
Edmund.
It
was
a
subject
which
she
must
learn
to
speak
of,
and
the
weakness
that
shrunk
from
it
would
soon
be
quite
unpardonable.
When
Mr.
Price
and
his
friend
had
seen
all
that
they
wished,
or
had
time
for,
the
others
were
ready
to
return;
and
in
the
course
of
their
walk
back,
Mr.
Crawford
contrived
a
minute's
privacy
for
telling
Fanny
that
his
only
business
in
Portsmouth
was
to
see
her;
that
he
was
come
down
for
a
couple
of
days
on
her
account,
and
hers
only,
and
because
he
could
not
endure
a
longer
total
separation.
She
was
sorry,
really
sorry;
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
and
the
two
or
three
other
things
which
she
wished
he
had
not
said,
she
thought
him
altogether
improved
since
she
had
seen
him;
he
was
much
more
gentle,
obliging,
and
attentive
to
other
people's
feelings
than
he
had
ever
been
at
Mansfield;
she
had
never
seen
him
so
agreeable
so
near
being
agreeable;
his
behaviour
to
her
father
could
not
offend,
and
there
was
something
particularly
kind
and
proper
in
the
notice
he
took
of
Susan.
He
was
decidedly
improved.
She
wished
the
next
day
over,
she
wished
he
had
come
only
for
one
day;
but
it
was
not
so
very
bad
as
she
would
have
expected:
the
pleasure
of
talking
of
Mansfield
was
so
very
great!
Before
they
parted,
she
had
to
thank
him
for
another
pleasure,
and
one
of
no
trivial
kind.
Her
father
asked
him
to
do
them
the
honour
of
taking
his
mutton
with
them,
and
Fanny
had
time
for
only
one
thrill
of
horror,
before
he
declared
himself
prevented
by
a
prior
engagement.
He
was
engaged
to
dinner
already
both
for
that
day
and
the
next;
he
had
met
with
some
acquaintance
at
the
Crown
who
would
not
be
denied;
he
should
have
the
honour,
however,
of
waiting
on
them
again
on
the
morrow,
etc.,
and
so
they
parted
Fanny
in
a
state
of
actual
felicity
from
escaping
so
horrible
an
evil!
To
have
had
him
join
their
family
dinner
party,
and
see
all
their
deficiencies,
would
have
been
dreadful!
Rebecca's
cookery
and
Rebecca's
waiting,
and
Betsey's
eating
at
table
without
restraint,
and
pulling
everything
about
as
she
chose,
were
what
Fanny
herself
was
not
yet
enough
inured
to
for
her
often
to
make
a
tolerable
meal.
She
was
nice
only
from
natural
delicacy,
but
he
had
been
brought
up
in
a
school
of
luxury
and
epicurism.
The
Prices
were
just
setting
off
for
church
the
next
day
when
Mr.
Crawford
appeared
again.
He
came,
not
to
stop,
but
to
join
them;
he
was
asked
to
go
with
them
to
the
Garrison
chapel,
which
was
exactly
what
he
had
intended,
and
they
all
walked
thither
together.
The
family
were
now
seen
to
advantage.
Nature
had
given
them
no
inconsiderable
share
of
beauty,
and
every
Sunday
dressed
them
in
their
cleanest
skins
and
best
attire.
Sunday
always
brought
this
comfort
to
Fanny,
and
on
this
Sunday
she
felt
it
more
than
ever.
Her
poor
mother
now
did
not
look
so
very
unworthy
of
being
Lady
Bertram's
sister
as
she
was
but
too
apt
to
look.
It
often
grieved
her
to
the
heart
to
think
of
the
contrast
between
them;
to
think
that
where
nature
had
made
so
little
difference,
circumstances
should
have
made
so
much,
and
that
her
mother,
as
handsome
as
Lady
Bertram,
and
some
years
her
junior,
should
have
an
appearance
so
much
more
worn
and
faded,
so
comfortless,
so
slatternly,
so
shabby.
But
Sunday
made
her
a
very
creditable
and
tolerably
cheerful
looking
Mrs.
Price,
coming
abroad
with
a
fine
family
of
children,
feeling
a
little
respite
of
her
weekly
cares,
and
only
discomposed
if
she
saw
her
boys
run
into
danger,
or
Rebecca
pass
by
with
a
flower
in
her
hat.
In
chapel
they
were
obliged
to
divide,
but
Mr.
Crawford
took
care
not
to
be
divided
from
the
female
branch;
and
after
chapel
he
still
continued
with
them,
and
made
one
in
the
family
party
on
the
ramparts.
Mrs.
Price
took
her
weekly
walk
on
the
ramparts
every
fine
Sunday
throughout
the
year,
always
going
directly
after
morning
service
and
staying
till
dinner
time.
It
was
her
public
place:
there
she
met
her
acquaintance,
heard
a
little
news,
talked
over
the
badness
of
the
Portsmouth
servants,
and
wound
up
her
spirits
for
the
six
days
ensuing.
Thither
they
now
went;
Mr.
Crawford
most
happy
to
consider
the
Miss
Prices
as
his
peculiar
charge;
and
before
they
had
been
there
long,
somehow
or
other,
there
was
no
saying
how,
Fanny
could
not
have
believed
it,
but
he
was
walking
between
them
with
an
arm
of
each
under
his,
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
prevent
or
put
an
end
to
it.
It
made
her
uncomfortable
for
a
time,
but
yet
there
were
enjoyments
in
the
day
and
in
the
view
which
would
be
felt.
The
day
was
uncommonly
lovely.
It
was
really
March;
but
it
was
April
in
its
mild
air,
brisk
soft
wind,
and
bright
sun,
occasionally
clouded
for
a
minute;
and
everything
looked
so
beautiful
under
the
influence
of
such
a
sky,
the
effects
of
the
shadows
pursuing
each
other
on
the
ships
at
Spithead
and
the
island
beyond,
with
the
ever
varying
hues
of
the
sea,
now
at
high
water,
dancing
in
its
glee
and
dashing
against
the
ramparts
with
so
fine
a
sound,
produced
altogether
such
a
combination
of
charms
for
Fanny,
as
made
her
gradually
almost
careless
of
the
circumstances
under
which
she
felt
them.
Nay,
had
she
been
without
his
arm,
she
would
soon
have
known
that
she
needed
it,
for
she
wanted
strength
for
a
two
hours'
saunter
of
this
kind,
coming,
as
it
generally
did,
upon
a
week's
previous
inactivity.
Fanny
was
beginning
to
feel
the
effect
of
being
debarred
from
her
usual
regular
exercise;
she
had
lost
ground
as
to
health
since
her
being
in
Portsmouth;
and
but
for
Mr.
Crawford
and
the
beauty
of
the
weather
would
soon
have
been
knocked
up
now.
The
loveliness
of
the
day,
and
of
the
view,
he
felt
like
herself.
They
often
stopt
with
the
same
sentiment
and
taste,
leaning
against
the
wall,
some
minutes,
to
look
and
admire;
and
considering
he
was
not
Edmund,
Fanny
could
not
but
allow
that
he
was
sufficiently
open
to
the
charms
of
nature,
and
very
well
able
to
express
his
admiration.
She
had
a
few
tender
reveries
now
and
then,
which
he
could
sometimes
take
advantage
of
to
look
in
her
face
without
detection;
and
the
result
of
these
looks
was,
that
though
as
bewitching
as
ever,
her
face
was
less
blooming
than
it
ought
to
be.
She
said
she
was
very
well,
and
did
not
like
to
be
supposed
otherwise;
but
take
it
all
in
all,
he
was
convinced
that
her
present
residence
could
not
be
comfortable,
and
therefore
could
not
be
salutary
for
her,
and
he
was
growing
anxious
for
her
being
again
at
Mansfield,
where
her
own
happiness,
and
his
in
seeing
her,
must
be
so
much
greater.
"You
have
been
here
a
month,
I
think?"
said
he.
"No;
not
quite
a
month.
It
is
only
four
weeks
to
morrow
since
I
left
Mansfield."
"You
are
a
most
accurate
and
honest
reckoner.
I
should
call
that
a
month."
"I
did
not
arrive
here
till
Tuesday
evening."
"And
it
is
to
be
a
two
months'
visit,
is
not?"
"Yes.
My
uncle
talked
of
two
months.
I
suppose
it
will
not
be
less."
"And
how
are
you
to
be
conveyed
back
again?
Who
comes
for
you?"
"I
do
not
know.
I
have
heard
nothing
about
it
yet
from
my
aunt.
Perhaps
I
may
be
to
stay
longer.
It
may
not
be
convenient
for
me
to
be
fetched
exactly
at
the
two
months'
end."
After
a
moment's
reflection,
Mr.
Crawford
replied,
"I
know
Mansfield,
I
know
its
way,
I
know
its
faults
towards
you.
I
know
the
danger
of
your
being
so
far
forgotten,
as
to
have
your
comforts
give
way
to
the
imaginary
convenience
of
any
single
being
in
the
family.
I
am
aware
that
you
may
be
left
here
week
after
week,
if
Sir
Thomas
cannot
settle
everything
for
coming
himself,
or
sending
your
aunt's
maid
for
you,
without
involving
the
slightest
alteration
of
the
arrangements
which
he
may
have
laid
down
for
the
next
quarter
of
a
year.
This
will
not
do.
Two
months
is
an
ample
allowance;
I
should
think
six
weeks
quite
enough.
I
am
considering
your
sister's
health,"
said
he,
addressing
himself
to
Susan,
"which
I
think
the
confinement
of
Portsmouth
unfavourable
to.
She
requires
constant
air
and
exercise.
When
you
know
her
as
well
as
I
do,
I
am
sure
you
will
agree
that
she
does,
and
that
she
ought
never
to
be
long
banished
from
the
free
air
and
liberty
of
the
country.
If,
therefore"
(turning
again
to
Fanny),
"you
find
yourself
growing
unwell,
and
any
difficulties
arise
about
your
returning
to
Mansfield,
without
waiting
for
the
two
months
to
be
ended,
that
must
not
be
regarded
as
of
any
consequence,
if
you
feel
yourself
at
all
less
strong
or
comfortable
than
usual,
and
will
only
let
my
sister
know
it,
give
her
only
the
slightest
hint,
she
and
I
will
immediately
come
down,
and
take
you
back
to
Mansfield.
You
know
the
ease
and
the
pleasure
with
which
this
would
be
done.
You
know
all
that
would
be
felt
on
the
occasion."
Fanny
thanked
him,
but
tried
to
laugh
it
off.
"I
am
perfectly
serious,"
he
replied,
"as
you
perfectly
know.
And
I
hope
you
will
not
be
cruelly
concealing
any
tendency
to
indisposition.
Indeed,
you
shall
not;
it
shall
not
be
in
your
power;
for
so
long
only
as
you
positively
say,
in
every
letter
to
Mary,
'I
am
well,'
and
I
know
you
cannot
speak
or
write
a
falsehood,
so
long
only
shall
you
be
considered
as
well."
Fanny
thanked
him
again,
but
was
affected
and
distressed
to
a
degree
that
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
say
much,
or
even
to
be
certain
of
what
she
ought
to
say.
This
was
towards
the
close
of
their
walk.
He
attended
them
to
the
last,
and
left
them
only
at
the
door
of
their
own
house,
when
he
knew
them
to
be
going
to
dinner,
and
therefore
pretended
to
be
waited
for
elsewhere.
"I
wish
you
were
not
so
tired,"
said
he,
still
detaining
Fanny
after
all
the
others
were
in
the
house
"I
wish
I
left
you
in
stronger
health.
Is
there
anything
I
can
do
for
you
in
town?
I
have
half
an
idea
of
going
into
Norfolk
again
soon.
I
am
not
satisfied
about
Maddison.
I
am
sure
he
still
means
to
impose
on
me
if
possible,
and
get
a
cousin
of
his
own
into
a
certain
mill,
which
I
design
for
somebody
else.
I
must
come
to
an
understanding
with
him.
I
must
make
him
know
that
I
will
not
be
tricked
on
the
south
side
of
Everingham,
any
more
than
on
the
north:
that
I
will
be
master
of
my
own
property.
I
was
not
explicit
enough
with
him
before.
The
mischief
such
a
man
does
on
an
estate,
both
as
to
the
credit
of
his
employer
and
the
welfare
of
the
poor,
is
inconceivable.
I
have
a
great
mind
to
go
back
into
Norfolk
directly,
and
put
everything
at
once
on
such
a
footing
as
cannot
be
afterwards
swerved
from.
Maddison
is
a
clever
fellow;
I
do
not
wish
to
displace
him,
provided
he
does
not
try
to
displace
me;
but
it
would
be
simple
to
be
duped
by
a
man
who
has
no
right
of
creditor
to
dupe
me,
and
worse
than
simple
to
let
him
give
me
a
hard
hearted,
griping
fellow
for
a
tenant,
instead
of
an
honest
man,
to
whom
I
have
given
half
a
promise
already.
Would
it
not
be
worse
than
simple?
Shall
I
go?
Do
you
advise
it?"
"I
advise!
You
know
very
well
what
is
right."
"Yes.
When
you
give
me
your
opinion,
I
always
know
what
is
right.
Your
judgment
is
my
rule
of
right."
"Oh,
no!
do
not
say
so.
We
have
all
a
better
guide
in
ourselves,
if
we
would
attend
to
it,
than
any
other
person
can
be.
Good
bye;
I
wish
you
a
pleasant
journey
to
morrow."
"Is
there
nothing
I
can
do
for
you
in
town?"
"Nothing;
I
am
much
obliged
to
you."
"Have
you
no
message
for
anybody?"
"My
love
to
your
sister,
if
you
please;
and
when
you
see
my
cousin,
my
cousin
Edmund,
I
wish
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
say
that
I
suppose
I
shall
soon
hear
from
him."
"Certainly;
and
if
he
is
lazy
or
negligent,
I
will
write
his
excuses
myself."
He
could
say
no
more,
for
Fanny
would
be
no
longer
detained.
He
pressed
her
hand,
looked
at
her,
and
was
gone.
He
went
to
while
away
the
next
three
hours
as
he
could,
with
his
other
acquaintance,
till
the
best
dinner
that
a
capital
inn
afforded
was
ready
for
their
enjoyment,
and
she
turned
in
to
her
more
simple
one
immediately.
Their
general
fare
bore
a
very
different
character;
and
could
he
have
suspected
how
many
privations,
besides
that
of
exercise,
she
endured
in
her
father's
house,
he
would
have
wondered
that
her
looks
were
not
much
more
affected
than
he
found
them.
She
was
so
little
equal
to
Rebecca's
puddings
and
Rebecca's
hashes,
brought
to
table,
as
they
all
were,
with
such
accompaniments
of
half
cleaned
plates,
and
not
half
cleaned
knives
and
forks,
that
she
was
very
often
constrained
to
defer
her
heartiest
meal
till
she
could
send
her
brothers
in
the
evening
for
biscuits
and
buns.
After
being
nursed
up
at
Mansfield,
it
was
too
late
in
the
day
to
be
hardened
at
Portsmouth;
and
though
Sir
Thomas,
had
he
known
all,
might
have
thought
his
niece
in
the
most
promising
way
of
being
starved,
both
mind
and
body,
into
a
much
juster
value
for
Mr.
Crawford's
good
company
and
good
fortune,
he
would
probably
have
feared
to
push
his
experiment
farther,
lest
she
might
die
under
the
cure.
Fanny
was
out
of
spirits
all
the
rest
of
the
day.
Though
tolerably
secure
of
not
seeing
Mr.
Crawford
again,
she
could
not
help
being
low.
It
was
parting
with
somebody
of
the
nature
of
a
friend;
and
though,
in
one
light,
glad
to
have
him
gone,
it
seemed
as
if
she
was
now
deserted
by
everybody;
it
was
a
sort
of
renewed
separation
from
Mansfield;
and
she
could
not
think
of
his
returning
to
town,
and
being
frequently
with
Mary
and
Edmund,
without
feelings
so
near
akin
to
envy
as
made
her
hate
herself
for
having
them.
Her
dejection
had
no
abatement
from
anything
passing
around
her;
a
friend
or
two
of
her
father's,
as
always
happened
if
he
was
not
with
them,
spent
the
long,
long
evening
there;
and
from
six
o'clock
till
half
past
nine,
there
was
little
intermission
of
noise
or
grog.
She
was
very
low.
The
wonderful
improvement
which
she
still
fancied
in
Mr.
Crawford
was
the
nearest
to
administering
comfort
of
anything
within
the
current
of
her
thoughts.
Not
considering
in
how
different
a
circle
she
had
been
just
seeing
him,
nor
how
much
might
be
owing
to
contrast,
she
was
quite
persuaded
of
his
being
astonishingly
more
gentle
and
regardful
of
others
than
formerly.
And,
if
in
little
things,
must
it
not
be
so
in
great?
So
anxious
for
her
health
and
comfort,
so
very
feeling
as
he
now
expressed
himself,
and
really
seemed,
might
not
it
be
fairly
supposed
that
he
would
not
much
longer
persevere
in
a
suit
so
distressing
to
her?
It
was
presumed
that
Mr.
Crawford
was
travelling
back,
to
London,
on
the
morrow,
for
nothing
more
was
seen
of
him
at
Mr.
Price's;
and
two
days
afterwards,
it
was
a
fact
ascertained
to
Fanny
by
the
following
letter
from
his
sister,
opened
and
read
by
her,
on
another
account,
with
the
most
anxious
curiosity:
"I
have
to
inform
you,
my
dearest
Fanny,
that
Henry
has
been
down
to
Portsmouth
to
see
you;
that
he
had
a
delightful
walk
with
you
to
the
dockyard
last
Saturday,
and
one
still
more
to
be
dwelt
on
the
next
day,
on
the
ramparts;
when
the
balmy
air,
the
sparkling
sea,
and
your
sweet
looks
and
conversation
were
altogether
in
the
most
delicious
harmony,
and
afforded
sensations
which
are
to
raise
ecstasy
even
in
retrospect.
This,
as
well
as
I
understand,
is
to
be
the
substance
of
my
information.
He
makes
me
write,
but
I
do
not
know
what
else
is
to
be
communicated,
except
this
said
visit
to
Portsmouth,
and
these
two
said
walks,
and
his
introduction
to
your
family,
especially
to
a
fair
sister
of
yours,
a
fine
girl
of
fifteen,
who
was
of
the
party
on
the
ramparts,
taking
her
first
lesson,
I
presume,
in
love.
I
have
not
time
for
writing
much,
but
it
would
be
out
of
place
if
I
had,
for
this
is
to
be
a
mere
letter
of
business,
penned
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
necessary
information,
which
could
not
be
delayed
without
risk
of
evil.
My
dear,
dear
Fanny,
if
I
had
you
here,
how
I
would
talk
to
you!
You
should
listen
to
me
till
you
were
tired,
and
advise
me
till
you
were
still
tired
more;
but
it
is
impossible
to
put
a
hundredth
part
of
my
great
mind
on
paper,
so
I
will
abstain
altogether,
and
leave
you
to
guess
what
you
like.
I
have
no
news
for
you.
You
have
politics,
of
course;
and
it
would
be
too
bad
to
plague
you
with
the
names
of
people
and
parties
that
fill
up
my
time.
I
ought
to
have
sent
you
an
account
of
your
cousin's
first
party,
but
I
was
lazy,
and
now
it
is
too
long
ago;
suffice
it,
that
everything
was
just
as
it
ought
to
be,
in
a
style
that
any
of
her
connexions
must
have
been
gratified
to
witness,
and
that
her
own
dress
and
manners
did
her
the
greatest
credit.
My
friend,
Mrs.
Fraser,
is
mad
for
such
a
house,
and
it
would
not
make
me
miserable.
I
go
to
Lady
Stornaway
after
Easter;
she
seems
in
high
spirits,
and
very
happy.
I
fancy
Lord
S.
is
very
good
humoured
and
pleasant
in
his
own
family,
and
I
do
not
think
him
so
very
ill
looking
as
I
did
at
least,
one
sees
many
worse.
He
will
not
do
by
the
side
of
your
cousin
Edmund.
Of
the
last
mentioned
hero,
what
shall
I
say?
If
I
avoided
his
name
entirely,
it
would
look
suspicious.
I
will
say,
then,
that
we
have
seen
him
two
or
three
times,
and
that
my
friends
here
are
very
much
struck
with
his
gentlemanlike
appearance.
Mrs.
Fraser
(no
bad
judge)
declares
she
knows
but
three
men
in
town
who
have
so
good
a
person,
height,
and
air;
and
I
must
confess,
when
he
dined
here
the
other
day,
there
were
none
to
compare
with
him,
and
we
were
a
party
of
sixteen.
Luckily
there
is
no
distinction
of
dress
nowadays
to
tell
tales,
but
but
but
Yours
affectionately."
"I
had
almost
forgot
(it
was
Edmund's
fault:
he
gets
into
my
head
more
than
does
me
good)
one
very
material
thing
I
had
to
say
from
Henry
and
myself
I
mean
about
our
taking
you
back
into
Northamptonshire.
My
dear
little
creature,
do
not
stay
at
Portsmouth
to
lose
your
pretty
looks.
Those
vile
sea
breezes
are
the
ruin
of
beauty
and
health.
My
poor
aunt
always
felt
affected
if
within
ten
miles
of
the
sea,
which
the
Admiral
of
course
never
believed,
but
I
know
it
was
so.
I
am
at
your
service
and
Henry's,
at
an
hour's
notice.
I
should
like
the
scheme,
and
we
would
make
a
little
circuit,
and
shew
you
Everingham
in
our
way,
and
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
passing
through
London,
and
seeing
the
inside
of
St.
George's,
Hanover
Square.
Only
keep
your
cousin
Edmund
from
me
at
such
a
time:
I
should
not
like
to
be
tempted.
What
a
long
letter!
one
word
more.
Henry,
I
find,
has
some
idea
of
going
into
Norfolk
again
upon
some
business
that
you
approve;
but
this
cannot
possibly
be
permitted
before
the
middle
of
next
week;
that
is,
he
cannot
anyhow
be
spared
till
after
the
14th,
for
we
have
a
party
that
evening.
The
value
of
a
man
like
Henry,
on
such
an
occasion,
is
what
you
can
have
no
conception
of;
so
you
must
take
it
upon
my
word
to
be
inestimable.
He
will
see
the
Rushworths,
which
own
I
am
not
sorry
for
having
a
little
curiosity,
and
so
I
think
has
he
though
he
will
not
acknowledge
it."
This
was
a
letter
to
be
run
through
eagerly,
to
be
read
deliberately,
to
supply
matter
for
much
reflection,
and
to
leave
everything
in
greater
suspense
than
ever.
The
only
certainty
to
be
drawn
from
it
was,
that
nothing
decisive
had
yet
taken
place.
Edmund
had
not
yet
spoken.
How
Miss
Crawford
really
felt,
how
she
meant
to
act,
or
might
act
without
or
against
her
meaning;
whether
his
importance
to
her
were
quite
what
it
had
been
before
the
last
separation;
whether,
if
lessened,
it
were
likely
to
lessen
more,
or
to
recover
itself,
were
subjects
for
endless
conjecture,
and
to
be
thought
of
on
that
day
and
many
days
to
come,
without
producing
any
conclusion.
The
idea
that
returned
the
oftenest
was
that
Miss
Crawford,
after
proving
herself
cooled
and
staggered
by
a
return
to
London
habits,
would
yet
prove
herself
in
the
end
too
much
attached
to
him
to
give
him
up.
She
would
try
to
be
more
ambitious
than
her
heart
would
allow.
She
would
hesitate,
she
would
tease,
she
would
condition,
she
would
require
a
great
deal,
but
she
would
finally
accept.
This
was
Fanny's
most
frequent
expectation.
A
house
in
town
that,
she
thought,
must
be
impossible.
Yet
there
was
no
saying
what
Miss
Crawford
might
not
ask.
The
prospect
for
her
cousin
grew
worse
and
worse.
The
woman
who
could
speak
of
him,
and
speak
only
of
his
appearance!
What
an
unworthy
attachment!
To
be
deriving
support
from
the
commendations
of
Mrs.
Fraser!
She
who
had
known
him
intimately
half
a
year!
Fanny
was
ashamed
of
her.
Those
parts
of
the
letter
which
related
only
to
Mr.
Crawford
and
herself,
touched
her,
in
comparison,
slightly.
Whether
Mr.
Crawford
went
into
Norfolk
before
or
after
the
14th
was
certainly
no
concern
of
hers,
though,
everything
considered,
she
thought
he
would
go
without
delay.
That
Miss
Crawford
should
endeavour
to
secure
a
meeting
between
him
and
Mrs.
Rushworth,
was
all
in
her
worst
line
of
conduct,
and
grossly
unkind
and
ill
judged;
but
she
hoped
he
would
not
be
actuated
by
any
such
degrading
curiosity.
He
acknowledged
no
such
inducement,
and
his
sister
ought
to
have
given
him
credit
for
better
feelings
than
her
own.
She
was
yet
more
impatient
for
another
letter
from
town
after
receiving
this
than
she
had
been
before;
and
for
a
few
days
was
so
unsettled
by
it
altogether,
by
what
had
come,
and
what
might
come,
that
her
usual
readings
and
conversation
with
Susan
were
much
suspended.
She
could
not
command
her
attention
as
she
wished.
If
Mr.
Crawford
remembered
her
message
to
her
cousin,
she
thought
it
very
likely,
most
likely,
that
he
would
write
to
her
at
all
events;
it
would
be
most
consistent
with
his
usual
kindness;
and
till
she
got
rid
of
this
idea,
till
it
gradually
wore
off,
by
no
letters
appearing
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
days
more,
she
was
in
a
most
restless,
anxious
state.
At
length,
a
something
like
composure
succeeded.
Suspense
must
be
submitted
to,
and
must
not
be
allowed
to
wear
her
out,
and
make
her
useless.
Time
did
something,
her
own
exertions
something
more,
and
she
resumed
her
attentions
to
Susan,
and
again
awakened
the
same
interest
in
them.
Susan
was
growing
very
fond
of
her,
and
though
without
any
of
the
early
delight
in
books
which
had
been
so
strong
in
Fanny,
with
a
disposition
much
less
inclined
to
sedentary
pursuits,
or
to
information
for
information's
sake,
she
had
so
strong
a
desire
of
not
appearing
ignorant,
as,
with
a
good
clear
understanding,
made
her
a
most
attentive,
profitable,
thankful
pupil.
Fanny
was
her
oracle.
Fanny's
explanations
and
remarks
were
a
most
important
addition
to
every
essay,
or
every
chapter
of
history.
What
Fanny
told
her
of
former
times
dwelt
more
on
her
mind
than
the
pages
of
Goldsmith;
and
she
paid
her
sister
the
compliment
of
preferring
her
style
to
that
of
any
printed
author.
The
early
habit
of
reading
was
wanting.
Their
conversations,
however,
were
not
always
on
subjects
so
high
as
history
or
morals.
Others
had
their
hour;
and
of
lesser
matters,
none
returned
so
often,
or
remained
so
long
between
them,
as
Mansfield
Park,
a
description
of
the
people,
the
manners,
the
amusements,
the
ways
of
Mansfield
Park.
Susan,
who
had
an
innate
taste
for
the
genteel
and
well
appointed,
was
eager
to
hear,
and
Fanny
could
not
but
indulge
herself
in
dwelling
on
so
beloved
a
theme.
She
hoped
it
was
not
wrong;
though,
after
a
time,
Susan's
very
great
admiration
of
everything
said
or
done
in
her
uncle's
house,
and
earnest
longing
to
go
into
Northamptonshire,
seemed
almost
to
blame
her
for
exciting
feelings
which
could
not
be
gratified.
Poor
Susan
was
very
little
better
fitted
for
home
than
her
elder
sister;
and
as
Fanny
grew
thoroughly
to
understand
this,
she
began
to
feel
that
when
her
own
release
from
Portsmouth
came,
her
happiness
would
have
a
material
drawback
in
leaving
Susan
behind.
That
a
girl
so
capable
of
being
made
everything
good
should
be
left
in
such
hands,
distressed
her
more
and
more.
Were
she
likely
to
have
a
home
to
invite
her
to,
what
a
blessing
it
would
be!
And
had
it
been
possible
for
her
to
return
Mr.
Crawford's
regard,
the
probability
of
his
being
very
far
from
objecting
to
such
a
measure
would
have
been
the
greatest
increase
of
all
her
own
comforts.
She
thought
he
was
really
good
tempered,
and
could
fancy
his
entering
into
a
plan
of
that
sort
most
pleasantly.
Seven
weeks
of
the
two
months
were
very
nearly
gone,
when
the
one
letter,
the
letter
from
Edmund,
so
long
expected,
was
put
into
Fanny's
hands.
As
she
opened,
and
saw
its
length,
she
prepared
herself
for
a
minute
detail
of
happiness
and
a
profusion
of
love
and
praise
towards
the
fortunate
creature
who
was
now
mistress
of
his
fate.
These
were
the
contents
"My
Dear
Fanny,
Excuse
me
that
I
have
not
written
before.
Crawford
told
me
that
you
were
wishing
to
hear
from
me,
but
I
found
it
impossible
to
write
from
London,
and
persuaded
myself
that
you
would
understand
my
silence.
Could
I
have
sent
a
few
happy
lines,
they
should
not
have
been
wanting,
but
nothing
of
that
nature
was
ever
in
my
power.
I
am
returned
to
Mansfield
in
a
less
assured
state
than
when
I
left
it.
My
hopes
are
much
weaker.
You
are
probably
aware
of
this
already.
So
very
fond
of
you
as
Miss
Crawford
is,
it
is
most
natural
that
she
should
tell
you
enough
of
her
own
feelings
to
furnish
a
tolerable
guess
at
mine.
I
will
not
be
prevented,
however,
from
making
my
own
communication.
Our
confidences
in
you
need
not
clash.
I
ask
no
questions.
There
is
something
soothing
in
the
idea
that
we
have
the
same
friend,
and
that
whatever
unhappy
differences
of
opinion
may
exist
between
us,
we
are
united
in
our
love
of
you.
It
will
be
a
comfort
to
me
to
tell
you
how
things
now
are,
and
what
are
my
present
plans,
if
plans
I
can
be
said
to
have.
I
have
been
returned
since
Saturday.
I
was
three
weeks
in
London,
and
saw
her
(for
London)
very
often.
I
had
every
attention
from
the
Frasers
that
could
be
reasonably
expected.
I
dare
say
I
was
not
reasonable
in
carrying
with
me
hopes
of
an
intercourse
at
all
like
that
of
Mansfield.
It
was
her
manner,
however,
rather
than
any
unfrequency
of
meeting.
Had
she
been
different
when
I
did
see
her,
I
should
have
made
no
complaint,
but
from
the
very
first
she
was
altered:
my
first
reception
was
so
unlike
what
I
had
hoped,
that
I
had
almost
resolved
on
leaving
London
again
directly.
I
need
not
particularise.
You
know
the
weak
side
of
her
character,
and
may
imagine
the
sentiments
and
expressions
which
were
torturing
me.
She
was
in
high
spirits,
and
surrounded
by
those
who
were
giving
all
the
support
of
their
own
bad
sense
to
her
too
lively
mind.
I
do
not
like
Mrs.
Fraser.
She
is
a
cold
hearted,
vain
woman,
who
has
married
entirely
from
convenience,
and
though
evidently
unhappy
in
her
marriage,
places
her
disappointment
not
to
faults
of
judgment,
or
temper,
or
disproportion
of
age,
but
to
her
being,
after
all,
less
affluent
than
many
of
her
acquaintance,
especially
than
her
sister,
Lady
Stornaway,
and
is
the
determined
supporter
of
everything
mercenary
and
ambitious,
provided
it
be
only
mercenary
and
ambitious
enough.
I
look
upon
her
intimacy
with
those
two
sisters
as
the
greatest
misfortune
of
her
life
and
mine.
They
have
been
leading
her
astray
for
years.
Could
she
be
detached
from
them!
and
sometimes
I
do
not
despair
of
it,
for
the
affection
appears
to
me
principally
on
their
side.
They
are
very
fond
of
her;
but
I
am
sure
she
does
not
love
them
as
she
loves
you.
When
I
think
of
her
great
attachment
to
you,
indeed,
and
the
whole
of
her
judicious,
upright
conduct
as
a
sister,
she
appears
a
very
different
creature,
capable
of
everything
noble,
and
I
am
ready
to
blame
myself
for
a
too
harsh
construction
of
a
playful
manner.
I
cannot
give
her
up,
Fanny.
She
is
the
only
woman
in
the
world
whom
I
could
ever
think
of
as
a
wife.
If
I
did
not
believe
that
she
had
some
regard
for
me,
of
course
I
should
not
say
this,
but
I
do
believe
it.
I
am
convinced
that
she
is
not
without
a
decided
preference.
I
have
no
jealousy
of
any
individual.
It
is
the
influence
of
the
fashionable
world
altogether
that
I
am
jealous
of.
It
is
the
habits
of
wealth
that
I
fear.
Her
ideas
are
not
higher
than
her
own
fortune
may
warrant,
but
they
are
beyond
what
our
incomes
united
could
authorise.
There
is
comfort,
however,
even
here.
I
could
better
bear
to
lose
her
because
not
rich
enough,
than
because
of
my
profession.
That
would
only
prove
her
affection
not
equal
to
sacrifices,
which,
in
fact,
I
am
scarcely
justified
in
asking;
and,
if
I
am
refused,
that,
I
think,
will
be
the
honest
motive.
Her
prejudices,
I
trust,
are
not
so
strong
as
they
were.
You
have
my
thoughts
exactly
as
they
arise,
my
dear
Fanny;
perhaps
they
are
sometimes
contradictory,
but
it
will
not
be
a
less
faithful
picture
of
my
mind.
Having
once
begun,
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
tell
you
all
I
feel.
I
cannot
give
her
up.
Connected
as
we
already
are,
and,
I
hope,
are
to
be,
to
give
up
Mary
Crawford
would
be
to
give
up
the
society
of
some
of
those
most
dear
to
me;
to
banish
myself
from
the
very
houses
and
friends
whom,
under
any
other
distress,
I
should
turn
to
for
consolation.
The
loss
of
Mary
I
must
consider
as
comprehending
the
loss
of
Crawford
and
of
Fanny.
Were
it
a
decided
thing,
an
actual
refusal,
I
hope
I
should
know
how
to
bear
it,
and
how
to
endeavour
to
weaken
her
hold
on
my
heart,
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
but
I
am
writing
nonsense.
Were
I
refused,
I
must
bear
it;
and
till
I
am,
I
can
never
cease
to
try
for
her.
This
is
the
truth.
The
only
question
is
how?
What
may
be
the
likeliest
means?
I
have
sometimes
thought
of
going
to
London
again
after
Easter,
and
sometimes
resolved
on
doing
nothing
till
she
returns
to
Mansfield.
Even
now,
she
speaks
with
pleasure
of
being
in
Mansfield
in
June;
but
June
is
at
a
great
distance,
and
I
believe
I
shall
write
to
her.
I
have
nearly
determined
on
explaining
myself
by
letter.
To
be
at
an
early
certainty
is
a
material
object.
My
present
state
is
miserably
irksome.
Considering
everything,
I
think
a
letter
will
be
decidedly
the
best
method
of
explanation.
I
shall
be
able
to
write
much
that
I
could
not
say,
and
shall
be
giving
her
time
for
reflection
before
she
resolves
on
her
answer,
and
I
am
less
afraid
of
the
result
of
reflection
than
of
an
immediate
hasty
impulse;
I
think
I
am.
My
greatest
danger
would
lie
in
her
consulting
Mrs.
Fraser,
and
I
at
a
distance
unable
to
help
my
own
cause.
A
letter
exposes
to
all
the
evil
of
consultation,
and
where
the
mind
is
anything
short
of
perfect
decision,
an
adviser
may,
in
an
unlucky
moment,
lead
it
to
do
what
it
may
afterwards
regret.
I
must
think
this
matter
over
a
little.
This
long
letter,
full
of
my
own
concerns
alone,
will
be
enough
to
tire
even
the
friendship
of
a
Fanny.
The
last
time
I
saw
Crawford
was
at
Mrs.
Fraser's
party.
I
am
more
and
more
satisfied
with
all
that
I
see
and
hear
of
him.
There
is
not
a
shadow
of
wavering.
He
thoroughly
knows
his
own
mind,
and
acts
up
to
his
resolutions:
an
inestimable
quality.
I
could
not
see
him
and
my
eldest
sister
in
the
same
room
without
recollecting
what
you
once
told
me,
and
I
acknowledge
that
they
did
not
meet
as
friends.
There
was
marked
coolness
on
her
side.
They
scarcely
spoke.
I
saw
him
draw
back
surprised,
and
I
was
sorry
that
Mrs.
Rushworth
should
resent
any
former
supposed
slight
to
Miss
Bertram.
You
will
wish
to
hear
my
opinion
of
Maria's
degree
of
comfort
as
a
wife.
There
is
no
appearance
of
unhappiness.
I
hope
they
get
on
pretty
well
together.
I
dined
twice
in
Wimpole
Street,
and
might
have
been
there
oftener,
but
it
is
mortifying
to
be
with
Rushworth
as
a
brother.
Julia
seems
to
enjoy
London
exceedingly.
I
had
little
enjoyment
there,
but
have
less
here.
We
are
not
a
lively
party.
You
are
very
much
wanted.
I
miss
you
more
than
I
can
express.
My
mother
desires
her
best
love,
and
hopes
to
hear
from
you
soon.
She
talks
of
you
almost
every
hour,
and
I
am
sorry
to
find
how
many
weeks
more
she
is
likely
to
be
without
you.
My
father
means
to
fetch
you
himself,
but
it
will
not
be
till
after
Easter,
when
he
has
business
in
town.
You
are
happy
at
Portsmouth,
I
hope,
but
this
must
not
be
a
yearly
visit.
I
want
you
at
home,
that
I
may
have
your
opinion
about
Thornton
Lacey.
I
have
little
heart
for
extensive
improvements
till
I
know
that
it
will
ever
have
a
mistress.
I
think
I
shall
certainly
write.
It
is
quite
settled
that
the
Grants
go
to
Bath;
they
leave
Mansfield
on
Monday.
I
am
glad
of
it.
I
am
not
comfortable
enough
to
be
fit
for
anybody;
but
your
aunt
seems
to
feel
out
of
luck
that
such
an
article
of
Mansfield
news
should
fall
to
my
pen
instead
of
hers.
Yours
ever,
my
dearest
Fanny."
"I
never
will,
no,
I
certainly
never
will
wish
for
a
letter
again,"
was
Fanny's
secret
declaration
as
she
finished
this.
"What
do
they
bring
but
disappointment
and
sorrow?
Not
till
after
Easter!
How
shall
I
bear
it?
And
my
poor
aunt
talking
of
me
every
hour!"
Fanny
checked
the
tendency
of
these
thoughts
as
well
as
she
could,
but
she
was
within
half
a
minute
of
starting
the
idea
that
Sir
Thomas
was
quite
unkind,
both
to
her
aunt
and
to
herself.
As
for
the
main
subject
of
the
letter,
there
was
nothing
in
that
to
soothe
irritation.
She
was
almost
vexed
into
displeasure
and
anger
against
Edmund.
"There
is
no
good
in
this
delay,"
said
she.
"Why
is
not
it
settled?
He
is
blinded,
and
nothing
will
open
his
eyes;
nothing
can,
after
having
had
truths
before
him
so
long
in
vain.
He
will
marry
her,
and
be
poor
and
miserable.
God
grant
that
her
influence
do
not
make
him
cease
to
be
respectable!"
She
looked
over
the
letter
again.
"'So
very
fond
of
me!'
'tis
nonsense
all.
She
loves
nobody
but
herself
and
her
brother.
Her
friends
leading
her
astray
for
years!
She
is
quite
as
likely
to
have
led
them
astray.
They
have
all,
perhaps,
been
corrupting
one
another;
but
if
they
are
so
much
fonder
of
her
than
she
is
of
them,
she
is
the
less
likely
to
have
been
hurt,
except
by
their
flattery.
'The
only
woman
in
the
world
whom
he
could
ever
think
of
as
a
wife.'
I
firmly
believe
it.
It
is
an
attachment
to
govern
his
whole
life.
Accepted
or
refused,
his
heart
is
wedded
to
her
for
ever.
'The
loss
of
Mary
I
must
consider
as
comprehending
the
loss
of
Crawford
and
Fanny.'
Edmund,
you
do
not
know
me.
The
families
would
never
be
connected
if
you
did
not
connect
them!
Oh!
write,
write.
Finish
it
at
once.
Let
there
be
an
end
of
this
suspense.
Fix,
commit,
condemn
yourself."
Such
sensations,
however,
were
too
near
akin
to
resentment
to
be
long
guiding
Fanny's
soliloquies.
She
was
soon
more
softened
and
sorrowful.
His
warm
regard,
his
kind
expressions,
his
confidential
treatment,
touched
her
strongly.
He
was
only
too
good
to
everybody.
It
was
a
letter,
in
short,
which
she
would
not
but
have
had
for
the
world,
and
which
could
never
be
valued
enough.
This
was
the
end
of
it.
Everybody
at
all
addicted
to
letter
writing,
without
having
much
to
say,
which
will
include
a
large
proportion
of
the
female
world
at
least,
must
feel
with
Lady
Bertram
that
she
was
out
of
luck
in
having
such
a
capital
piece
of
Mansfield
news
as
the
certainty
of
the
Grants
going
to
Bath,
occur
at
a
time
when
she
could
make
no
advantage
of
it,
and
will
admit
that
it
must
have
been
very
mortifying
to
her
to
see
it
fall
to
the
share
of
her
thankless
son,
and
treated
as
concisely
as
possible
at
the
end
of
a
long
letter,
instead
of
having
it
to
spread
over
the
largest
part
of
a
page
of
her
own.
For
though
Lady
Bertram
rather
shone
in
the
epistolary
line,
having
early
in
her
marriage,
from
the
want
of
other
employment,
and
the
circumstance
of
Sir
Thomas's
being
in
Parliament,
got
into
the
way
of
making
and
keeping
correspondents,
and
formed
for
herself
a
very
creditable,
common
place,
amplifying
style,
so
that
a
very
little
matter
was
enough
for
her:
she
could
not
do
entirely
without
any;
she
must
have
something
to
write
about,
even
to
her
niece;
and
being
so
soon
to
lose
all
the
benefit
of
Dr.
Grant's
gouty
symptoms
and
Mrs.
Grant's
morning
calls,
it
was
very
hard
upon
her
to
be
deprived
of
one
of
the
last
epistolary
uses
she
could
put
them
to.
There
was
a
rich
amends,
however,
preparing
for
her.
Lady
Bertram's
hour
of
good
luck
came.
Within
a
few
days
from
the
receipt
of
Edmund's
letter,
Fanny
had
one
from
her
aunt,
beginning
thus
"My
Dear
Fanny,
I
take
up
my
pen
to
communicate
some
very
alarming
intelligence,
which
I
make
no
doubt
will
give
you
much
concern".
This
was
a
great
deal
better
than
to
have
to
take
up
the
pen
to
acquaint
her
with
all
the
particulars
of
the
Grants'
intended
journey,
for
the
present
intelligence
was
of
a
nature
to
promise
occupation
for
the
pen
for
many
days
to
come,
being
no
less
than
the
dangerous
illness
of
her
eldest
son,
of
which
they
had
received
notice
by
express
a
few
hours
before.
Tom
had
gone
from
London
with
a
party
of
young
men
to
Newmarket,
where
a
neglected
fall
and
a
good
deal
of
drinking
had
brought
on
a
fever;
and
when
the
party
broke
up,
being
unable
to
move,
had
been
left
by
himself
at
the
house
of
one
of
these
young
men
to
the
comforts
of
sickness
and
solitude,
and
the
attendance
only
of
servants.
Instead
of
being
soon
well
enough
to
follow
his
friends,
as
he
had
then
hoped,
his
disorder
increased
considerably,
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
thought
so
ill
of
himself
as
to
be
as
ready
as
his
physician
to
have
a
letter
despatched
to
Mansfield.
"This
distressing
intelligence,
as
you
may
suppose,"
observed
her
ladyship,
after
giving
the
substance
of
it,
"has
agitated
us
exceedingly,
and
we
cannot
prevent
ourselves
from
being
greatly
alarmed
and
apprehensive
for
the
poor
invalid,
whose
state
Sir
Thomas
fears
may
be
very
critical;
and
Edmund
kindly
proposes
attending
his
brother
immediately,
but
I
am
happy
to
add
that
Sir
Thomas
will
not
leave
me
on
this
distressing
occasion,
as
it
would
be
too
trying
for
me.
We
shall
greatly
miss
Edmund
in
our
small
circle,
but
I
trust
and
hope
he
will
find
the
poor
invalid
in
a
less
alarming
state
than
might
be
apprehended,
and
that
he
will
be
able
to
bring
him
to
Mansfield
shortly,
which
Sir
Thomas
proposes
should
be
done,
and
thinks
best
on
every
account,
and
I
flatter
myself
the
poor
sufferer
will
soon
be
able
to
bear
the
removal
without
material
inconvenience
or
injury.
As
I
have
little
doubt
of
your
feeling
for
us,
my
dear
Fanny,
under
these
distressing
circumstances,
I
will
write
again
very
soon."
Fanny's
feelings
on
the
occasion
were
indeed
considerably
more
warm
and
genuine
than
her
aunt's
style
of
writing.
She
felt
truly
for
them
all.
Tom
dangerously
ill,
Edmund
gone
to
attend
him,
and
the
sadly
small
party
remaining
at
Mansfield,
were
cares
to
shut
out
every
other
care,
or
almost
every
other.
She
could
just
find
selfishness
enough
to
wonder
whether
Edmund
had
written
to
Miss
Crawford
before
this
summons
came,
but
no
sentiment
dwelt
long
with
her
that
was
not
purely
affectionate
and
disinterestedly
anxious.
Her
aunt
did
not
neglect
her:
she
wrote
again
and
again;
they
were
receiving
frequent
accounts
from
Edmund,
and
these
accounts
were
as
regularly
transmitted
to
Fanny,
in
the
same
diffuse
style,
and
the
same
medley
of
trusts,
hopes,
and
fears,
all
following
and
producing
each
other
at
haphazard.
It
was
a
sort
of
playing
at
being
frightened.
The
sufferings
which
Lady
Bertram
did
not
see
had
little
power
over
her
fancy;
and
she
wrote
very
comfortably
about
agitation,
and
anxiety,
and
poor
invalids,
till
Tom
was
actually
conveyed
to
Mansfield,
and
her
own
eyes
had
beheld
his
altered
appearance.
Then
a
letter
which
she
had
been
previously
preparing
for
Fanny
was
finished
in
a
different
style,
in
the
language
of
real
feeling
and
alarm;
then
she
wrote
as
she
might
have
spoken.
"He
is
just
come,
my
dear
Fanny,
and
is
taken
upstairs;
and
I
am
so
shocked
to
see
him,
that
I
do
not
know
what
to
do.
I
am
sure
he
has
been
very
ill.
Poor
Tom!
I
am
quite
grieved
for
him,
and
very
much
frightened,
and
so
is
Sir
Thomas;
and
how
glad
I
should
be
if
you
were
here
to
comfort
me.
But
Sir
Thomas
hopes
he
will
be
better
to
morrow,
and
says
we
must
consider
his
journey."
The
real
solicitude
now
awakened
in
the
maternal
bosom
was
not
soon
over.
Tom's
extreme
impatience
to
be
removed
to
Mansfield,
and
experience
those
comforts
of
home
and
family
which
had
been
little
thought
of
in
uninterrupted
health,
had
probably
induced
his
being
conveyed
thither
too
early,
as
a
return
of
fever
came
on,
and
for
a
week
he
was
in
a
more
alarming
state
than
ever.
They
were
all
very
seriously
frightened.
Lady
Bertram
wrote
her
daily
terrors
to
her
niece,
who
might
now
be
said
to
live
upon
letters,
and
pass
all
her
time
between
suffering
from
that
of
to
day
and
looking
forward
to
to
morrow's.
Without
any
particular
affection
for
her
eldest
cousin,
her
tenderness
of
heart
made
her
feel
that
she
could
not
spare
him,
and
the
purity
of
her
principles
added
yet
a
keener
solicitude,
when
she
considered
how
little
useful,
how
little
self
denying
his
life
had
(apparently)
been.
Susan
was
her
only
companion
and
listener
on
this,
as
on
more
common
occasions.
Susan
was
always
ready
to
hear
and
to
sympathise.
Nobody
else
could
be
interested
in
so
remote
an
evil
as
illness
in
a
family
above
an
hundred
miles
off;
not
even
Mrs.
Price,
beyond
a
brief
question
or
two,
if
she
saw
her
daughter
with
a
letter
in
her
hand,
and
now
and
then
the
quiet
observation
of,
"My
poor
sister
Bertram
must
be
in
a
great
deal
of
trouble."
So
long
divided
and
so
differently
situated,
the
ties
of
blood
were
little
more
than
nothing.
An
attachment,
originally
as
tranquil
as
their
tempers,
was
now
become
a
mere
name.
Mrs.
Price
did
quite
as
much
for
Lady
Bertram
as
Lady
Bertram
would
have
done
for
Mrs.
Price.
Three
or
four
Prices
might
have
been
swept
away,
any
or
all
except
Fanny
and
William,
and
Lady
Bertram
would
have
thought
little
about
it;
or
perhaps
might
have
caught
from
Mrs.
Norris's
lips
the
cant
of
its
being
a
very
happy
thing
and
a
great
blessing
to
their
poor
dear
sister
Price
to
have
them
so
well
provided
for.
At
about
the
week's
end
from
his
return
to
Mansfield,
Tom's
immediate
danger
was
over,
and
he
was
so
far
pronounced
safe
as
to
make
his
mother
perfectly
easy;
for
being
now
used
to
the
sight
of
him
in
his
suffering,
helpless
state,
and
hearing
only
the
best,
and
never
thinking
beyond
what
she
heard,
with
no
disposition
for
alarm
and
no
aptitude
at
a
hint,
Lady
Bertram
was
the
happiest
subject
in
the
world
for
a
little
medical
imposition.
The
fever
was
subdued;
the
fever
had
been
his
complaint;
of
course
he
would
soon
be
well
again.
Lady
Bertram
could
think
nothing
less,
and
Fanny
shared
her
aunt's
security,
till
she
received
a
few
lines
from
Edmund,
written
purposely
to
give
her
a
clearer
idea
of
his
brother's
situation,
and
acquaint
her
with
the
apprehensions
which
he
and
his
father
had
imbibed
from
the
physician
with
respect
to
some
strong
hectic
symptoms,
which
seemed
to
seize
the
frame
on
the
departure
of
the
fever.
They
judged
it
best
that
Lady
Bertram
should
not
be
harassed
by
alarms
which,
it
was
to
be
hoped,
would
prove
unfounded;
but
there
was
no
reason
why
Fanny
should
not
know
the
truth.
They
were
apprehensive
for
his
lungs.
A
very
few
lines
from
Edmund
shewed
her
the
patient
and
the
sickroom
in
a
juster
and
stronger
light
than
all
Lady
Bertram's
sheets
of
paper
could
do.
There
was
hardly
any
one
in
the
house
who
might
not
have
described,
from
personal
observation,
better
than
herself;
not
one
who
was
not
more
useful
at
times
to
her
son.
She
could
do
nothing
but
glide
in
quietly
and
look
at
him;
but
when
able
to
talk
or
be
talked
to,
or
read
to,
Edmund
was
the
companion
he
preferred.
His
aunt
worried
him
by
her
cares,
and
Sir
Thomas
knew
not
how
to
bring
down
his
conversation
or
his
voice
to
the
level
of
irritation
and
feebleness.
Edmund
was
all
in
all.
Fanny
would
certainly
believe
him
so
at
least,
and
must
find
that
her
estimation
of
him
was
higher
than
ever
when
he
appeared
as
the
attendant,
supporter,
cheerer
of
a
suffering
brother.
There
was
not
only
the
debility
of
recent
illness
to
assist:
there
was
also,
as
she
now
learnt,
nerves
much
affected,
spirits
much
depressed
to
calm
and
raise,
and
her
own
imagination
added
that
there
must
be
a
mind
to
be
properly
guided.
The
family
were
not
consumptive,
and
she
was
more
inclined
to
hope
than
fear
for
her
cousin,
except
when
she
thought
of
Miss
Crawford;
but
Miss
Crawford
gave
her
the
idea
of
being
the
child
of
good
luck,
and
to
her
selfishness
and
vanity
it
would
be
good
luck
to
have
Edmund
the
only
son.
Even
in
the
sick
chamber
the
fortunate
Mary
was
not
forgotten.
Edmund's
letter
had
this
postscript.
"On
the
subject
of
my
last,
I
had
actually
begun
a
letter
when
called
away
by
Tom's
illness,
but
I
have
now
changed
my
mind,
and
fear
to
trust
the
influence
of
friends.
When
Tom
is
better,
I
shall
go."
Such
was
the
state
of
Mansfield,
and
so
it
continued,
with
scarcely
any
change,
till
Easter.
A
line
occasionally
added
by
Edmund
to
his
mother's
letter
was
enough
for
Fanny's
information.
Tom's
amendment
was
alarmingly
slow.
Easter
came
particularly
late
this
year,
as
Fanny
had
most
sorrowfully
considered,
on
first
learning
that
she
had
no
chance
of
leaving
Portsmouth
till
after
it.
It
came,
and
she
had
yet
heard
nothing
of
her
return
nothing
even
of
the
going
to
London,
which
was
to
precede
her
return.
Her
aunt
often
expressed
a
wish
for
her,
but
there
was
no
notice,
no
message
from
the
uncle
on
whom
all
depended.
She
supposed
he
could
not
yet
leave
his
son,
but
it
was
a
cruel,
a
terrible
delay
to
her.
The
end
of
April
was
coming
on;
it
would
soon
be
almost
three
months,
instead
of
two,
that
she
had
been
absent
from
them
all,
and
that
her
days
had
been
passing
in
a
state
of
penance,
which
she
loved
them
too
well
to
hope
they
would
thoroughly
understand;
and
who
could
yet
say
when
there
might
be
leisure
to
think
of
or
fetch
her?
Her
eagerness,
her
impatience,
her
longings
to
be
with
them,
were
such
as
to
bring
a
line
or
two
of
Cowper's
Tirocinium
for
ever
before
her.
"With
what
intense
desire
she
wants
her
home,"
was
continually
on
her
tongue,
as
the
truest
description
of
a
yearning
which
she
could
not
suppose
any
schoolboy's
bosom
to
feel
more
keenly.
When
she
had
been
coming
to
Portsmouth,
she
had
loved
to
call
it
her
home,
had
been
fond
of
saying
that
she
was
going
home;
the
word
had
been
very
dear
to
her,
and
so
it
still
was,
but
it
must
be
applied
to
Mansfield.
That
was
now
the
home.
Portsmouth
was
Portsmouth;
Mansfield
was
home.
They
had
been
long
so
arranged
in
the
indulgence
of
her
secret
meditations,
and
nothing
was
more
consolatory
to
her
than
to
find
her
aunt
using
the
same
language:
"I
cannot
but
say
I
much
regret
your
being
from
home
at
this
distressing
time,
so
very
trying
to
my
spirits.
I
trust
and
hope,
and
sincerely
wish
you
may
never
be
absent
from
home
so
long
again,"
were
most
delightful
sentences
to
her.
Still,
however,
it
was
her
private
regale.
Delicacy
to
her
parents
made
her
careful
not
to
betray
such
a
preference
of
her
uncle's
house.
It
was
always:
"When
I
go
back
into
Northamptonshire,
or
when
I
return
to
Mansfield,
I
shall
do
so
and
so."
For
a
great
while
it
was
so,
but
at
last
the
longing
grew
stronger,
it
overthrew
caution,
and
she
found
herself
talking
of
what
she
should
do
when
she
went
home
before
she
was
aware.
She
reproached
herself,
coloured,
and
looked
fearfully
towards
her
father
and
mother.
She
need
not
have
been
uneasy.
There
was
no
sign
of
displeasure,
or
even
of
hearing
her.
They
were
perfectly
free
from
any
jealousy
of
Mansfield.
She
was
as
welcome
to
wish
herself
there
as
to
be
there.
It
was
sad
to
Fanny
to
lose
all
the
pleasures
of
spring.
She
had
not
known
before
what
pleasures
she
had
to
lose
in
passing
March
and
April
in
a
town.
She
had
not
known
before
how
much
the
beginnings
and
progress
of
vegetation
had
delighted
her.
What
animation,
both
of
body
and
mind,
she
had
derived
from
watching
the
advance
of
that
season
which
cannot,
in
spite
of
its
capriciousness,
be
unlovely,
and
seeing
its
increasing
beauties
from
the
earliest
flowers
in
the
warmest
divisions
of
her
aunt's
garden,
to
the
opening
of
leaves
of
her
uncle's
plantations,
and
the
glory
of
his
woods.
To
be
losing
such
pleasures
was
no
trifle;
to
be
losing
them,
because
she
was
in
the
midst
of
closeness
and
noise,
to
have
confinement,
bad
air,
bad
smells,
substituted
for
liberty,
freshness,
fragrance,
and
verdure,
was
infinitely
worse:
but
even
these
incitements
to
regret
were
feeble,
compared
with
what
arose
from
the
conviction
of
being
missed
by
her
best
friends,
and
the
longing
to
be
useful
to
those
who
were
wanting
her!
Could
she
have
been
at
home,
she
might
have
been
of
service
to
every
creature
in
the
house.
She
felt
that
she
must
have
been
of
use
to
all.
To
all
she
must
have
saved
some
trouble
of
head
or
hand;
and
were
it
only
in
supporting
the
spirits
of
her
aunt
Bertram,
keeping
her
from
the
evil
of
solitude,
or
the
still
greater
evil
of
a
restless,
officious
companion,
too
apt
to
be
heightening
danger
in
order
to
enhance
her
own
importance,
her
being
there
would
have
been
a
general
good.
She
loved
to
fancy
how
she
could
have
read
to
her
aunt,
how
she
could
have
talked
to
her,
and
tried
at
once
to
make
her
feel
the
blessing
of
what
was,
and
prepare
her
mind
for
what
might
be;
and
how
many
walks
up
and
down
stairs
she
might
have
saved
her,
and
how
many
messages
she
might
have
carried.
It
astonished
her
that
Tom's
sisters
could
be
satisfied
with
remaining
in
London
at
such
a
time,
through
an
illness
which
had
now,
under
different
degrees
of
danger,
lasted
several
weeks.
They
might
return
to
Mansfield
when
they
chose;
travelling
could
be
no
difficulty
to
them,
and
she
could
not
comprehend
how
both
could
still
keep
away.
If
Mrs.
Rushworth
could
imagine
any
interfering
obligations,
Julia
was
certainly
able
to
quit
London
whenever
she
chose.
It
appeared
from
one
of
her
aunt's
letters
that
Julia
had
offered
to
return
if
wanted,
but
this
was
all.
It
was
evident
that
she
would
rather
remain
where
she
was.
Fanny
was
disposed
to
think
the
influence
of
London
very
much
at
war
with
all
respectable
attachments.
She
saw
the
proof
of
it
in
Miss
Crawford,
as
well
as
in
her
cousins;
her
attachment
to
Edmund
had
been
respectable,
the
most
respectable
part
of
her
character;
her
friendship
for
herself
had
at
least
been
blameless.
Where
was
either
sentiment
now?
It
was
so
long
since
Fanny
had
had
any
letter
from
her,
that
she
had
some
reason
to
think
lightly
of
the
friendship
which
had
been
so
dwelt
on.
It
was
weeks
since
she
had
heard
anything
of
Miss
Crawford
or
of
her
other
connexions
in
town,
except
through
Mansfield,
and
she
was
beginning
to
suppose
that
she
might
never
know
whether
Mr.
Crawford
had
gone
into
Norfolk
again
or
not
till
they
met,
and
might
never
hear
from
his
sister
any
more
this
spring,
when
the
following
letter
was
received
to
revive
old
and
create
some
new
sensations
"Forgive
me,
my
dear
Fanny,
as
soon
as
you
can,
for
my
long
silence,
and
behave
as
if
you
could
forgive
me
directly.
This
is
my
modest
request
and
expectation,
for
you
are
so
good,
that
I
depend
upon
being
treated
better
than
I
deserve,
and
I
write
now
to
beg
an
immediate
answer.
I
want
to
know
the
state
of
things
at
Mansfield
Park,
and
you,
no
doubt,
are
perfectly
able
to
give
it.
One
should
be
a
brute
not
to
feel
for
the
distress
they
are
in;
and
from
what
I
hear,
poor
Mr.
Bertram
has
a
bad
chance
of
ultimate
recovery.
I
thought
little
of
his
illness
at
first.
I
looked
upon
him
as
the
sort
of
person
to
be
made
a
fuss
with,
and
to
make
a
fuss
himself
in
any
trifling
disorder,
and
was
chiefly
concerned
for
those
who
had
to
nurse
him;
but
now
it
is
confidently
asserted
that
he
is
really
in
a
decline,
that
the
symptoms
are
most
alarming,
and
that
part
of
the
family,
at
least,
are
aware
of
it.
If
it
be
so,
I
am
sure
you
must
be
included
in
that
part,
that
discerning
part,
and
therefore
entreat
you
to
let
me
know
how
far
I
have
been
rightly
informed.
I
need
not
say
how
rejoiced
I
shall
be
to
hear
there
has
been
any
mistake,
but
the
report
is
so
prevalent
that
I
confess
I
cannot
help
trembling.
To
have
such
a
fine
young
man
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
his
days
is
most
melancholy.
Poor
Sir
Thomas
will
feel
it
dreadfully.
I
really
am
quite
agitated
on
the
subject.
Fanny,
Fanny,
I
see
you
smile
and
look
cunning,
but,
upon
my
honour,
I
never
bribed
a
physician
in
my
life.
Poor
young
man!
If
he
is
to
die,
there
will
be
two
poor
young
men
less
in
the
world;
and
with
a
fearless
face
and
bold
voice
would
I
say
to
any
one,
that
wealth
and
consequence
could
fall
into
no
hands
more
deserving
of
them.
It
was
a
foolish
precipitation
last
Christmas,
but
the
evil
of
a
few
days
may
be
blotted
out
in
part.
Varnish
and
gilding
hide
many
stains.
It
will
be
but
the
loss
of
the
Esquire
after
his
name.
With
real
affection,
Fanny,
like
mine,
more
might
be
overlooked.
Write
to
me
by
return
of
post,
judge
of
my
anxiety,
and
do
not
trifle
with
it.
Tell
me
the
real
truth,
as
you
have
it
from
the
fountainhead.
And
now,
do
not
trouble
yourself
to
be
ashamed
of
either
my
feelings
or
your
own.
Believe
me,
they
are
not
only
natural,
they
are
philanthropic
and
virtuous.
I
put
it
to
your
conscience,
whether
'Sir
Edmund'
would
not
do
more
good
with
all
the
Bertram
property
than
any
other
possible
'Sir.'
Had
the
Grants
been
at
home
I
would
not
have
troubled
you,
but
you
are
now
the
only
one
I
can
apply
to
for
the
truth,
his
sisters
not
being
within
my
reach.
Mrs.
R.
has
been
spending
the
Easter
with
the
Aylmers
at
Twickenham
(as
to
be
sure
you
know),
and
is
not
yet
returned;
and
Julia
is
with
the
cousins
who
live
near
Bedford
Square,
but
I
forget
their
name
and
street.
Could
I
immediately
apply
to
either,
however,
I
should
still
prefer
you,
because
it
strikes
me
that
they
have
all
along
been
so
unwilling
to
have
their
own
amusements
cut
up,
as
to
shut
their
eyes
to
the
truth.
I
suppose
Mrs.
R.'s
Easter
holidays
will
not
last
much
longer;
no
doubt
they
are
thorough
holidays
to
her.
The
Aylmers
are
pleasant
people;
and
her
husband
away,
she
can
have
nothing
but
enjoyment.
I
give
her
credit
for
promoting
his
going
dutifully
down
to
Bath,
to
fetch
his
mother;
but
how
will
she
and
the
dowager
agree
in
one
house?
Henry
is
not
at
hand,
so
I
have
nothing
to
say
from
him.
Do
not
you
think
Edmund
would
have
been
in
town
again
long
ago,
but
for
this
illness?
Yours
ever,
Mary."
"I
had
actually
begun
folding
my
letter
when
Henry
walked
in,
but
he
brings
no
intelligence
to
prevent
my
sending
it.
Mrs.
R.
knows
a
decline
is
apprehended;
he
saw
her
this
morning:
she
returns
to
Wimpole
Street
to
day;
the
old
lady
is
come.
Now
do
not
make
yourself
uneasy
with
any
queer
fancies
because
he
has
been
spending
a
few
days
at
Richmond.
He
does
it
every
spring.
Be
assured
he
cares
for
nobody
but
you.
At
this
very
moment
he
is
wild
to
see
you,
and
occupied
only
in
contriving
the
means
for
doing
so,
and
for
making
his
pleasure
conduce
to
yours.
In
proof,
he
repeats,
and
more
eagerly,
what
he
said
at
Portsmouth
about
our
conveying
you
home,
and
I
join
him
in
it
with
all
my
soul.
Dear
Fanny,
write
directly,
and
tell
us
to
come.
It
will
do
us
all
good.
He
and
I
can
go
to
the
Parsonage,
you
know,
and
be
no
trouble
to
our
friends
at
Mansfield
Park.
It
would
really
be
gratifying
to
see
them
all
again,
and
a
little
addition
of
society
might
be
of
infinite
use
to
them;
and
as
to
yourself,
you
must
feel
yourself
to
be
so
wanted
there,
that
you
cannot
in
conscience
conscientious
as
you
are
keep
away,
when
you
have
the
means
of
returning.
I
have
not
time
or
patience
to
give
half
Henry's
messages;
be
satisfied
that
the
spirit
of
each
and
every
one
is
unalterable
affection."
Fanny's
disgust
at
the
greater
part
of
this
letter,
with
her
extreme
reluctance
to
bring
the
writer
of
it
and
her
cousin
Edmund
together,
would
have
made
her
(as
she
felt)
incapable
of
judging
impartially
whether
the
concluding
offer
might
be
accepted
or
not.
To
herself,
individually,
it
was
most
tempting.
To
be
finding
herself,
perhaps
within
three
days,
transported
to
Mansfield,
was
an
image
of
the
greatest
felicity,
but
it
would
have
been
a
material
drawback
to
be
owing
such
felicity
to
persons
in
whose
feelings
and
conduct,
at
the
present
moment,
she
saw
so
much
to
condemn:
the
sister's
feelings,
the
brother's
conduct,
her
cold
hearted
ambition,
his
thoughtless
vanity.
To
have
him
still
the
acquaintance,
the
flirt
perhaps,
of
Mrs.
Rushworth!
She
was
mortified.
She
had
thought
better
of
him.
Happily,
however,
she
was
not
left
to
weigh
and
decide
between
opposite
inclinations
and
doubtful
notions
of
right;
there
was
no
occasion
to
determine
whether
she
ought
to
keep
Edmund
and
Mary
asunder
or
not.
She
had
a
rule
to
apply
to,
which
settled
everything.
Her
awe
of
her
uncle,
and
her
dread
of
taking
a
liberty
with
him,
made
it
instantly
plain
to
her
what
she
had
to
do.
She
must
absolutely
decline
the
proposal.
If
he
wanted,
he
would
send
for
her;
and
even
to
offer
an
early
return
was
a
presumption
which
hardly
anything
would
have
seemed
to
justify.
She
thanked
Miss
Crawford,
but
gave
a
decided
negative.
"Her
uncle,
she
understood,
meant
to
fetch
her;
and
as
her
cousin's
illness
had
continued
so
many
weeks
without
her
being
thought
at
all
necessary,
she
must
suppose
her
return
would
be
unwelcome
at
present,
and
that
she
should
be
felt
an
encumbrance."
Her
representation
of
her
cousin's
state
at
this
time
was
exactly
according
to
her
own
belief
of
it,
and
such
as
she
supposed
would
convey
to
the
sanguine
mind
of
her
correspondent
the
hope
of
everything
she
was
wishing
for.
Edmund
would
be
forgiven
for
being
a
clergyman,
it
seemed,
under
certain
conditions
of
wealth;
and
this,
she
suspected,
was
all
the
conquest
of
prejudice
which
he
was
so
ready
to
congratulate
himself
upon.
She
had
only
learnt
to
think
nothing
of
consequence
but
money.
As
Fanny
could
not
doubt
that
her
answer
was
conveying
a
real
disappointment,
she
was
rather
in
expectation,
from
her
knowledge
of
Miss
Crawford's
temper,
of
being
urged
again;
and
though
no
second
letter
arrived
for
the
space
of
a
week,
she
had
still
the
same
feeling
when
it
did
come.
On
receiving
it,
she
could
instantly
decide
on
its
containing
little
writing,
and
was
persuaded
of
its
having
the
air
of
a
letter
of
haste
and
business.
Its
object
was
unquestionable;
and
two
moments
were
enough
to
start
the
probability
of
its
being
merely
to
give
her
notice
that
they
should
be
in
Portsmouth
that
very
day,
and
to
throw
her
into
all
the
agitation
of
doubting
what
she
ought
to
do
in
such
a
case.
If
two
moments,
however,
can
surround
with
difficulties,
a
third
can
disperse
them;
and
before
she
had
opened
the
letter,
the
possibility
of
Mr.
and
Miss
Crawford's
having
applied
to
her
uncle
and
obtained
his
permission
was
giving
her
ease.
This
was
the
letter
"A
most
scandalous,
ill
natured
rumour
has
just
reached
me,
and
I
write,
dear
Fanny,
to
warn
you
against
giving
the
least
credit
to
it,
should
it
spread
into
the
country.
Depend
upon
it,
there
is
some
mistake,
and
that
a
day
or
two
will
clear
it
up;
at
any
rate,
that
Henry
is
blameless,
and
in
spite
of
a
moment's
etourderie,
thinks
of
nobody
but
you.
Say
not
a
word
of
it;
hear
nothing,
surmise
nothing,
whisper
nothing
till
I
write
again.
I
am
sure
it
will
be
all
hushed
up,
and
nothing
proved
but
Rushworth's
folly.
If
they
are
gone,
I
would
lay
my
life
they
are
only
gone
to
Mansfield
Park,
and
Julia
with
them.
But
why
would
not
you
let
us
come
for
you?
I
wish
you
may
not
repent
it.
Yours,
etc."
Fanny
stood
aghast.
As
no
scandalous,
ill
natured
rumour
had
reached
her,
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
understand
much
of
this
strange
letter.
She
could
only
perceive
that
it
must
relate
to
Wimpole
Street
and
Mr.
Crawford,
and
only
conjecture
that
something
very
imprudent
had
just
occurred
in
that
quarter
to
draw
the
notice
of
the
world,
and
to
excite
her
jealousy,
in
Miss
Crawford's
apprehension,
if
she
heard
it.
Miss
Crawford
need
not
be
alarmed
for
her.
She
was
only
sorry
for
the
parties
concerned
and
for
Mansfield,
if
the
report
should
spread
so
far;
but
she
hoped
it
might
not.
If
the
Rushworths
were
gone
themselves
to
Mansfield,
as
was
to
be
inferred
from
what
Miss
Crawford
said,
it
was
not
likely
that
anything
unpleasant
should
have
preceded
them,
or
at
least
should
make
any
impression.
As
to
Mr.
Crawford,
she
hoped
it
might
give
him
a
knowledge
of
his
own
disposition,
convince
him
that
he
was
not
capable
of
being
steadily
attached
to
any
one
woman
in
the
world,
and
shame
him
from
persisting
any
longer
in
addressing
herself.
It
was
very
strange!
She
had
begun
to
think
he
really
loved
her,
and
to
fancy
his
affection
for
her
something
more
than
common;
and
his
sister
still
said
that
he
cared
for
nobody
else.
Yet
there
must
have
been
some
marked
display
of
attentions
to
her
cousin,
there
must
have
been
some
strong
indiscretion,
since
her
correspondent
was
not
of
a
sort
to
regard
a
slight
one.
Very
uncomfortable
she
was,
and
must
continue,
till
she
heard
from
Miss
Crawford
again.
It
was
impossible
to
banish
the
letter
from
her
thoughts,
and
she
could
not
relieve
herself
by
speaking
of
it
to
any
human
being.
Miss
Crawford
need
not
have
urged
secrecy
with
so
much
warmth;
she
might
have
trusted
to
her
sense
of
what
was
due
to
her
cousin.
The
next
day
came
and
brought
no
second
letter.
Fanny
was
disappointed.
She
could
still
think
of
little
else
all
the
morning;
but,
when
her
father
came
back
in
the
afternoon
with
the
daily
newspaper
as
usual,
she
was
so
far
from
expecting
any
elucidation
through
such
a
channel
that
the
subject
was
for
a
moment
out
of
her
head.
She
was
deep
in
other
musing.
The
remembrance
of
her
first
evening
in
that
room,
of
her
father
and
his
newspaper,
came
across
her.
No
candle
was
now
wanted.
The
sun
was
yet
an
hour
and
half
above
the
horizon.
She
felt
that
she
had,
indeed,
been
three
months
there;
and
the
sun's
rays
falling
strongly
into
the
parlour,
instead
of
cheering,
made
her
still
more
melancholy,
for
sunshine
appeared
to
her
a
totally
different
thing
in
a
town
and
in
the
country.
Here,
its
power
was
only
a
glare:
a
stifling,
sickly
glare,
serving
but
to
bring
forward
stains
and
dirt
that
might
otherwise
have
slept.
There
was
neither
health
nor
gaiety
in
sunshine
in
a
town.
She
sat
in
a
blaze
of
oppressive
heat,
in
a
cloud
of
moving
dust,
and
her
eyes
could
only
wander
from
the
walls,
marked
by
her
father's
head,
to
the
table
cut
and
notched
by
her
brothers,
where
stood
the
tea
board
never
thoroughly
cleaned,
the
cups
and
saucers
wiped
in
streaks,
the
milk
a
mixture
of
motes
floating
in
thin
blue,
and
the
bread
and
butter
growing
every
minute
more
greasy
than
even
Rebecca's
hands
had
first
produced
it.
Her
father
read
his
newspaper,
and
her
mother
lamented
over
the
ragged
carpet
as
usual,
while
the
tea
was
in
preparation,
and
wished
Rebecca
would
mend
it;
and
Fanny
was
first
roused
by
his
calling
out
to
her,
after
humphing
and
considering
over
a
particular
paragraph:
"What's
the
name
of
your
great
cousins
in
town,
Fan?"
A
moment's
recollection
enabled
her
to
say,
"Rushworth,
sir."
"And
don't
they
live
in
Wimpole
Street?"
"Yes,
sir."
"Then,
there's
the
devil
to
pay
among
them,
that's
all!
There"
(holding
out
the
paper
to
her);
"much
good
may
such
fine
relations
do
you.
I
don't
know
what
Sir
Thomas
may
think
of
such
matters;
he
may
be
too
much
of
the
courtier
and
fine
gentleman
to
like
his
daughter
the
less.
But,
by
G
!
if
she
belonged
to
me,
I'd
give
her
the
rope's
end
as
long
as
I
could
stand
over
her.
A
little
flogging
for
man
and
woman
too
would
be
the
best
way
of
preventing
such
things."
Fanny
read
to
herself
that
"it
was
with
infinite
concern
the
newspaper
had
to
announce
to
the
world
a
matrimonial
fracas
in
the
family
of
Mr.
R.
of
Wimpole
Street;
the
beautiful
Mrs.
R.,
whose
name
had
not
long
been
enrolled
in
the
lists
of
Hymen,
and
who
had
promised
to
become
so
brilliant
a
leader
in
the
fashionable
world,
having
quitted
her
husband's
roof
in
company
with
the
well
known
and
captivating
Mr.
C.,
the
intimate
friend
and
associate
of
Mr.
R.,
and
it
was
not
known
even
to
the
editor
of
the
newspaper
whither
they
were
gone."
"It
is
a
mistake,
sir,"
said
Fanny
instantly;
"it
must
be
a
mistake,
it
cannot
be
true;
it
must
mean
some
other
people."
She
spoke
from
the
instinctive
wish
of
delaying
shame;
she
spoke
with
a
resolution
which
sprung
from
despair,
for
she
spoke
what
she
did
not,
could
not
believe
herself.
It
had
been
the
shock
of
conviction
as
she
read.
The
truth
rushed
on
her;
and
how
she
could
have
spoken
at
all,
how
she
could
even
have
breathed,
was
afterwards
matter
of
wonder
to
herself.
Mr.
Price
cared
too
little
about
the
report
to
make
her
much
answer.
"It
might
be
all
a
lie,"
he
acknowledged;
"but
so
many
fine
ladies
were
going
to
the
devil
nowadays
that
way,
that
there
was
no
answering
for
anybody."
"Indeed,
I
hope
it
is
not
true,"
said
Mrs.
Price
plaintively;
"it
would
be
so
very
shocking!
If
I
have
spoken
once
to
Rebecca
about
that
carpet,
I
am
sure
I
have
spoke
at
least
a
dozen
times;
have
not
I,
Betsey?
And
it
would
not
be
ten
minutes'
work."
The
horror
of
a
mind
like
Fanny's,
as
it
received
the
conviction
of
such
guilt,
and
began
to
take
in
some
part
of
the
misery
that
must
ensue,
can
hardly
be
described.
At
first,
it
was
a
sort
of
stupefaction;
but
every
moment
was
quickening
her
perception
of
the
horrible
evil.
She
could
not
doubt,
she
dared
not
indulge
a
hope,
of
the
paragraph
being
false.
Miss
Crawford's
letter,
which
she
had
read
so
often
as
to
make
every
line
her
own,
was
in
frightful
conformity
with
it.
Her
eager
defence
of
her
brother,
her
hope
of
its
being
hushed
up,
her
evident
agitation,
were
all
of
a
piece
with
something
very
bad;
and
if
there
was
a
woman
of
character
in
existence,
who
could
treat
as
a
trifle
this
sin
of
the
first
magnitude,
who
would
try
to
gloss
it
over,
and
desire
to
have
it
unpunished,
she
could
believe
Miss
Crawford
to
be
the
woman!
Now
she
could
see
her
own
mistake
as
to
who
were
gone,
or
said
to
be
gone.
It
was
not
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Rushworth;
it
was
Mrs.
Rushworth
and
Mr.
Crawford.
Fanny
seemed
to
herself
never
to
have
been
shocked
before.
There
was
no
possibility
of
rest.
The
evening
passed
without
a
pause
of
misery,
the
night
was
totally
sleepless.
She
passed
only
from
feelings
of
sickness
to
shudderings
of
horror;
and
from
hot
fits
of
fever
to
cold.
The
event
was
so
shocking,
that
there
were
moments
even
when
her
heart
revolted
from
it
as
impossible:
when
she
thought
it
could
not
be.
A
woman
married
only
six
months
ago;
a
man
professing
himself
devoted,
even
engaged
to
another;
that
other
her
near
relation;
the
whole
family,
both
families
connected
as
they
were
by
tie
upon
tie;
all
friends,
all
intimate
together!
It
was
too
horrible
a
confusion
of
guilt,
too
gross
a
complication
of
evil,
for
human
nature,
not
in
a
state
of
utter
barbarism,
to
be
capable
of!
yet
her
judgment
told
her
it
was
so.
His
unsettled
affections,
wavering
with
his
vanity,
Maria's
decided
attachment,
and
no
sufficient
principle
on
either
side,
gave
it
possibility:
Miss
Crawford's
letter
stampt
it
a
fact.
What
would
be
the
consequence?
Whom
would
it
not
injure?
Whose
views
might
it
not
affect?
Whose
peace
would
it
not
cut
up
for
ever?
Miss
Crawford,
herself,
Edmund;
but
it
was
dangerous,
perhaps,
to
tread
such
ground.
She
confined
herself,
or
tried
to
confine
herself,
to
the
simple,
indubitable
family
misery
which
must
envelop
all,
if
it
were
indeed
a
matter
of
certified
guilt
and
public
exposure.
The
mother's
sufferings,
the
father's;
there
she
paused.
Julia's,
Tom's,
Edmund's;
there
a
yet
longer
pause.
They
were
the
two
on
whom
it
would
fall
most
horribly.
Sir
Thomas's
parental
solicitude
and
high
sense
of
honour
and
decorum,
Edmund's
upright
principles,
unsuspicious
temper,
and
genuine
strength
of
feeling,
made
her
think
it
scarcely
possible
for
them
to
support
life
and
reason
under
such
disgrace;
and
it
appeared
to
her
that,
as
far
as
this
world
alone
was
concerned,
the
greatest
blessing
to
every
one
of
kindred
with
Mrs.
Rushworth
would
be
instant
annihilation.
Nothing
happened
the
next
day,
or
the
next,
to
weaken
her
terrors.
Two
posts
came
in,
and
brought
no
refutation,
public
or
private.
There
was
no
second
letter
to
explain
away
the
first
from
Miss
Crawford;
there
was
no
intelligence
from
Mansfield,
though
it
was
now
full
time
for
her
to
hear
again
from
her
aunt.
This
was
an
evil
omen.
She
had,
indeed,
scarcely
the
shadow
of
a
hope
to
soothe
her
mind,
and
was
reduced
to
so
low
and
wan
and
trembling
a
condition,
as
no
mother,
not
unkind,
except
Mrs.
Price
could
have
overlooked,
when
the
third
day
did
bring
the
sickening
knock,
and
a
letter
was
again
put
into
her
hands.
It
bore
the
London
postmark,
and
came
from
Edmund.
"Dear
Fanny,
You
know
our
present
wretchedness.
May
God
support
you
under
your
share!
We
have
been
here
two
days,
but
there
is
nothing
to
be
done.
They
cannot
be
traced.
You
may
not
have
heard
of
the
last
blow
Julia's
elopement;
she
is
gone
to
Scotland
with
Yates.
She
left
London
a
few
hours
before
we
entered
it.
At
any
other
time
this
would
have
been
felt
dreadfully.
Now
it
seems
nothing;
yet
it
is
an
heavy
aggravation.
My
father
is
not
overpowered.
More
cannot
be
hoped.
He
is
still
able
to
think
and
act;
and
I
write,
by
his
desire,
to
propose
your
returning
home.
He
is
anxious
to
get
you
there
for
my
mother's
sake.
I
shall
be
at
Portsmouth
the
morning
after
you
receive
this,
and
hope
to
find
you
ready
to
set
off
for
Mansfield.
My
father
wishes
you
to
invite
Susan
to
go
with
you
for
a
few
months.
Settle
it
as
you
like;
say
what
is
proper;
I
am
sure
you
will
feel
such
an
instance
of
his
kindness
at
such
a
moment!
Do
justice
to
his
meaning,
however
I
may
confuse
it.
You
may
imagine
something
of
my
present
state.
There
is
no
end
of
the
evil
let
loose
upon
us.
You
will
see
me
early
by
the
mail.
Yours,
etc."
Never
had
Fanny
more
wanted
a
cordial.
Never
had
she
felt
such
a
one
as
this
letter
contained.
To
morrow!
to
leave
Portsmouth
to
morrow!
She
was,
she
felt
she
was,
in
the
greatest
danger
of
being
exquisitely
happy,
while
so
many
were
miserable.
The
evil
which
brought
such
good
to
her!
She
dreaded
lest
she
should
learn
to
be
insensible
of
it.
To
be
going
so
soon,
sent
for
so
kindly,
sent
for
as
a
comfort,
and
with
leave
to
take
Susan,
was
altogether
such
a
combination
of
blessings
as
set
her
heart
in
a
glow,
and
for
a
time
seemed
to
distance
every
pain,
and
make
her
incapable
of
suitably
sharing
the
distress
even
of
those
whose
distress
she
thought
of
most.
Julia's
elopement
could
affect
her
comparatively
but
little;
she
was
amazed
and
shocked;
but
it
could
not
occupy
her,
could
not
dwell
on
her
mind.
She
was
obliged
to
call
herself
to
think
of
it,
and
acknowledge
it
to
be
terrible
and
grievous,
or
it
was
escaping
her,
in
the
midst
of
all
the
agitating
pressing
joyful
cares
attending
this
summons
to
herself.
There
is
nothing
like
employment,
active
indispensable
employment,
for
relieving
sorrow.
Employment,
even
melancholy,
may
dispel
melancholy,
and
her
occupations
were
hopeful.
She
had
so
much
to
do,
that
not
even
the
horrible
story
of
Mrs.
Rushworth
now
fixed
to
the
last
point
of
certainty
could
affect
her
as
it
had
done
before.
She
had
not
time
to
be
miserable.
Within
twenty
four
hours
she
was
hoping
to
be
gone;
her
father
and
mother
must
be
spoken
to,
Susan
prepared,
everything
got
ready.
Business
followed
business;
the
day
was
hardly
long
enough.
The
happiness
she
was
imparting,
too,
happiness
very
little
alloyed
by
the
black
communication
which
must
briefly
precede
it
the
joyful
consent
of
her
father
and
mother
to
Susan's
going
with
her
the
general
satisfaction
with
which
the
going
of
both
seemed
regarded,
and
the
ecstasy
of
Susan
herself,
was
all
serving
to
support
her
spirits.
The
affliction
of
the
Bertrams
was
little
felt
in
the
family.
Mrs.
Price
talked
of
her
poor
sister
for
a
few
minutes,
but
how
to
find
anything
to
hold
Susan's
clothes,
because
Rebecca
took
away
all
the
boxes
and
spoilt
them,
was
much
more
in
her
thoughts:
and
as
for
Susan,
now
unexpectedly
gratified
in
the
first
wish
of
her
heart,
and
knowing
nothing
personally
of
those
who
had
sinned,
or
of
those
who
were
sorrowing
if
she
could
help
rejoicing
from
beginning
to
end,
it
was
as
much
as
ought
to
be
expected
from
human
virtue
at
fourteen.
As
nothing
was
really
left
for
the
decision
of
Mrs.
Price,
or
the
good
offices
of
Rebecca,
everything
was
rationally
and
duly
accomplished,
and
the
girls
were
ready
for
the
morrow.
The
advantage
of
much
sleep
to
prepare
them
for
their
journey
was
impossible.
The
cousin
who
was
travelling
towards
them
could
hardly
have
less
than
visited
their
agitated
spirits
one
all
happiness,
the
other
all
varying
and
indescribable
perturbation.
By
eight
in
the
morning
Edmund
was
in
the
house.
The
girls
heard
his
entrance
from
above,
and
Fanny
went
down.
The
idea
of
immediately
seeing
him,
with
the
knowledge
of
what
he
must
be
suffering,
brought
back
all
her
own
first
feelings.
He
so
near
her,
and
in
misery.
She
was
ready
to
sink
as
she
entered
the
parlour.
He
was
alone,
and
met
her
instantly;
and
she
found
herself
pressed
to
his
heart
with
only
these
words,
just
articulate,
"My
Fanny,
my
only
sister;
my
only
comfort
now!"
She
could
say
nothing;
nor
for
some
minutes
could
he
say
more.
He
turned
away
to
recover
himself,
and
when
he
spoke
again,
though
his
voice
still
faltered,
his
manner
shewed
the
wish
of
self
command,
and
the
resolution
of
avoiding
any
farther
allusion.
"Have
you
breakfasted?
When
shall
you
be
ready?
Does
Susan
go?"
were
questions
following
each
other
rapidly.
His
great
object
was
to
be
off
as
soon
as
possible.
When
Mansfield
was
considered,
time
was
precious;
and
the
state
of
his
own
mind
made
him
find
relief
only
in
motion.
It
was
settled
that
he
should
order
the
carriage
to
the
door
in
half
an
hour.
Fanny
answered
for
their
having
breakfasted
and
being
quite
ready
in
half
an
hour.
He
had
already
ate,
and
declined
staying
for
their
meal.
He
would
walk
round
the
ramparts,
and
join
them
with
the
carriage.
He
was
gone
again;
glad
to
get
away
even
from
Fanny.
He
looked
very
ill;
evidently
suffering
under
violent
emotions,
which
he
was
determined
to
suppress.
She
knew
it
must
be
so,
but
it
was
terrible
to
her.
The
carriage
came;
and
he
entered
the
house
again
at
the
same
moment,
just
in
time
to
spend
a
few
minutes
with
the
family,
and
be
a
witness
but
that
he
saw
nothing
of
the
tranquil
manner
in
which
the
daughters
were
parted
with,
and
just
in
time
to
prevent
their
sitting
down
to
the
breakfast
table,
which,
by
dint
of
much
unusual
activity,
was
quite
and
completely
ready
as
the
carriage
drove
from
the
door.
Fanny's
last
meal
in
her
father's
house
was
in
character
with
her
first:
she
was
dismissed
from
it
as
hospitably
as
she
had
been
welcomed.
How
her
heart
swelled
with
joy
and
gratitude
as
she
passed
the
barriers
of
Portsmouth,
and
how
Susan's
face
wore
its
broadest
smiles,
may
be
easily
conceived.
Sitting
forwards,
however,
and
screened
by
her
bonnet,
those
smiles
were
unseen.
The
journey
was
likely
to
be
a
silent
one.
Edmund's
deep
sighs
often
reached
Fanny.
Had
he
been
alone
with
her,
his
heart
must
have
opened
in
spite
of
every
resolution;
but
Susan's
presence
drove
him
quite
into
himself,
and
his
attempts
to
talk
on
indifferent
subjects
could
never
be
long
supported.
Fanny
watched
him
with
never
failing
solicitude,
and
sometimes
catching
his
eye,
revived
an
affectionate
smile,
which
comforted
her;
but
the
first
day's
journey
passed
without
her
hearing
a
word
from
him
on
the
subjects
that
were
weighing
him
down.
The
next
morning
produced
a
little
more.
Just
before
their
setting
out
from
Oxford,
while
Susan
was
stationed
at
a
window,
in
eager
observation
of
the
departure
of
a
large
family
from
the
inn,
the
other
two
were
standing
by
the
fire;
and
Edmund,
particularly
struck
by
the
alteration
in
Fanny's
looks,
and
from
his
ignorance
of
the
daily
evils
of
her
father's
house,
attributing
an
undue
share
of
the
change,
attributing
all
to
the
recent
event,
took
her
hand,
and
said
in
a
low,
but
very
expressive
tone,
"No
wonder
you
must
feel
it
you
must
suffer.
How
a
man
who
had
once
loved,
could
desert
you!
But
yours
your
regard
was
new
compared
with
Fanny,
think
of
me!"
The
first
division
of
their
journey
occupied
a
long
day,
and
brought
them,
almost
knocked
up,
to
Oxford;
but
the
second
was
over
at
a
much
earlier
hour.
They
were
in
the
environs
of
Mansfield
long
before
the
usual
dinner
time,
and
as
they
approached
the
beloved
place,
the
hearts
of
both
sisters
sank
a
little.
Fanny
began
to
dread
the
meeting
with
her
aunts
and
Tom,
under
so
dreadful
a
humiliation;
and
Susan
to
feel
with
some
anxiety,
that
all
her
best
manners,
all
her
lately
acquired
knowledge
of
what
was
practised
here,
was
on
the
point
of
being
called
into
action.
Visions
of
good
and
ill
breeding,
of
old
vulgarisms
and
new
gentilities,
were
before
her;
and
she
was
meditating
much
upon
silver
forks,
napkins,
and
finger
glasses.
Fanny
had
been
everywhere
awake
to
the
difference
of
the
country
since
February;
but
when
they
entered
the
Park
her
perceptions
and
her
pleasures
were
of
the
keenest
sort.
It
was
three
months,
full
three
months,
since
her
quitting
it,
and
the
change
was
from
winter
to
summer.
Her
eye
fell
everywhere
on
lawns
and
plantations
of
the
freshest
green;
and
the
trees,
though
not
fully
clothed,
were
in
that
delightful
state
when
farther
beauty
is
known
to
be
at
hand,
and
when,
while
much
is
actually
given
to
the
sight,
more
yet
remains
for
the
imagination.
Her
enjoyment,
however,
was
for
herself
alone.
Edmund
could
not
share
it.
She
looked
at
him,
but
he
was
leaning
back,
sunk
in
a
deeper
gloom
than
ever,
and
with
eyes
closed,
as
if
the
view
of
cheerfulness
oppressed
him,
and
the
lovely
scenes
of
home
must
be
shut
out.
It
made
her
melancholy
again;
and
the
knowledge
of
what
must
be
enduring
there,
invested
even
the
house,
modern,
airy,
and
well
situated
as
it
was,
with
a
melancholy
aspect.
By
one
of
the
suffering
party
within
they
were
expected
with
such
impatience
as
she
had
never
known
before.
Fanny
had
scarcely
passed
the
solemn
looking
servants,
when
Lady
Bertram
came
from
the
drawing
room
to
meet
her;
came
with
no
indolent
step;
and
falling
on
her
neck,
said,
"Dear
Fanny!
now
I
shall
be
comfortable."
It
had
been
a
miserable
party,
each
of
the
three
believing
themselves
most
miserable.
Mrs.
Norris,
however,
as
most
attached
to
Maria,
was
really
the
greatest
sufferer.
Maria
was
her
first
favourite,
the
dearest
of
all;
the
match
had
been
her
own
contriving,
as
she
had
been
wont
with
such
pride
of
heart
to
feel
and
say,
and
this
conclusion
of
it
almost
overpowered
her.
She
was
an
altered
creature,
quieted,
stupefied,
indifferent
to
everything
that
passed.
The
being
left
with
her
sister
and
nephew,
and
all
the
house
under
her
care,
had
been
an
advantage
entirely
thrown
away;
she
had
been
unable
to
direct
or
dictate,
or
even
fancy
herself
useful.
When
really
touched
by
affliction,
her
active
powers
had
been
all
benumbed;
and
neither
Lady
Bertram
nor
Tom
had
received
from
her
the
smallest
support
or
attempt
at
support.
She
had
done
no
more
for
them
than
they
had
done
for
each
other.
They
had
been
all
solitary,
helpless,
and
forlorn
alike;
and
now
the
arrival
of
the
others
only
established
her
superiority
in
wretchedness.
Her
companions
were
relieved,
but
there
was
no
good
for
her.
Edmund
was
almost
as
welcome
to
his
brother
as
Fanny
to
her
aunt;
but
Mrs.
Norris,
instead
of
having
comfort
from
either,
was
but
the
more
irritated
by
the
sight
of
the
person
whom,
in
the
blindness
of
her
anger,
she
could
have
charged
as
the
daemon
of
the
piece.
Had
Fanny
accepted
Mr.
Crawford
this
could
not
have
happened.
Susan
too
was
a
grievance.
She
had
not
spirits
to
notice
her
in
more
than
a
few
repulsive
looks,
but
she
felt
her
as
a
spy,
and
an
intruder,
and
an
indigent
niece,
and
everything
most
odious.
By
her
other
aunt,
Susan
was
received
with
quiet
kindness.
Lady
Bertram
could
not
give
her
much
time,
or
many
words,
but
she
felt
her,
as
Fanny's
sister,
to
have
a
claim
at
Mansfield,
and
was
ready
to
kiss
and
like
her;
and
Susan
was
more
than
satisfied,
for
she
came
perfectly
aware
that
nothing
but
ill
humour
was
to
be
expected
from
aunt
Norris;
and
was
so
provided
with
happiness,
so
strong
in
that
best
of
blessings,
an
escape
from
many
certain
evils,
that
she
could
have
stood
against
a
great
deal
more
indifference
than
she
met
with
from
the
others.
She
was
now
left
a
good
deal
to
herself,
to
get
acquainted
with
the
house
and
grounds
as
she
could,
and
spent
her
days
very
happily
in
so
doing,
while
those
who
might
otherwise
have
attended
to
her
were
shut
up,
or
wholly
occupied
each
with
the
person
quite
dependent
on
them,
at
this
time,
for
everything
like
comfort;
Edmund
trying
to
bury
his
own
feelings
in
exertions
for
the
relief
of
his
brother's,
and
Fanny
devoted
to
her
aunt
Bertram,
returning
to
every
former
office
with
more
than
former
zeal,
and
thinking
she
could
never
do
enough
for
one
who
seemed
so
much
to
want
her.
To
talk
over
the
dreadful
business
with
Fanny,
talk
and
lament,
was
all
Lady
Bertram's
consolation.
To
be
listened
to
and
borne
with,
and
hear
the
voice
of
kindness
and
sympathy
in
return,
was
everything
that
could
be
done
for
her.
To
be
otherwise
comforted
was
out
of
the
question.
The
case
admitted
of
no
comfort.
Lady
Bertram
did
not
think
deeply,
but,
guided
by
Sir
Thomas,
she
thought
justly
on
all
important
points;
and
she
saw,
therefore,
in
all
its
enormity,
what
had
happened,
and
neither
endeavoured
herself,
nor
required
Fanny
to
advise
her,
to
think
little
of
guilt
and
infamy.
Her
affections
were
not
acute,
nor
was
her
mind
tenacious.
After
a
time,
Fanny
found
it
not
impossible
to
direct
her
thoughts
to
other
subjects,
and
revive
some
interest
in
the
usual
occupations;
but
whenever
Lady
Bertram
was
fixed
on
the
event,
she
could
see
it
only
in
one
light,
as
comprehending
the
loss
of
a
daughter,
and
a
disgrace
never
to
be
wiped
off.
Fanny
learnt
from
her
all
the
particulars
which
had
yet
transpired.
Her
aunt
was
no
very
methodical
narrator,
but
with
the
help
of
some
letters
to
and
from
Sir
Thomas,
and
what
she
already
knew
herself,
and
could
reasonably
combine,
she
was
soon
able
to
understand
quite
as
much
as
she
wished
of
the
circumstances
attending
the
story.
Mrs.
Rushworth
had
gone,
for
the
Easter
holidays,
to
Twickenham,
with
a
family
whom
she
had
just
grown
intimate
with:
a
family
of
lively,
agreeable
manners,
and
probably
of
morals
and
discretion
to
suit,
for
to
their
house
Mr.
Crawford
had
constant
access
at
all
times.
His
having
been
in
the
same
neighbourhood
Fanny
already
knew.
Mr.
Rushworth
had
been
gone
at
this
time
to
Bath,
to
pass
a
few
days
with
his
mother,
and
bring
her
back
to
town,
and
Maria
was
with
these
friends
without
any
restraint,
without
even
Julia;
for
Julia
had
removed
from
Wimpole
Street
two
or
three
weeks
before,
on
a
visit
to
some
relations
of
Sir
Thomas;
a
removal
which
her
father
and
mother
were
now
disposed
to
attribute
to
some
view
of
convenience
on
Mr.
Yates's
account.
Very
soon
after
the
Rushworths'
return
to
Wimpole
Street,
Sir
Thomas
had
received
a
letter
from
an
old
and
most
particular
friend
in
London,
who
hearing
and
witnessing
a
good
deal
to
alarm
him
in
that
quarter,
wrote
to
recommend
Sir
Thomas's
coming
to
London
himself,
and
using
his
influence
with
his
daughter
to
put
an
end
to
the
intimacy
which
was
already
exposing
her
to
unpleasant
remarks,
and
evidently
making
Mr.
Rushworth
uneasy.
Sir
Thomas
was
preparing
to
act
upon
this
letter,
without
communicating
its
contents
to
any
creature
at
Mansfield,
when
it
was
followed
by
another,
sent
express
from
the
same
friend,
to
break
to
him
the
almost
desperate
situation
in
which
affairs
then
stood
with
the
young
people.
Mrs.
Rushworth
had
left
her
husband's
house:
Mr.
Rushworth
had
been
in
great
anger
and
distress
to
him
(Mr.
Harding)
for
his
advice;
Mr.
Harding
feared
there
had
been
at
least
very
flagrant
indiscretion.
The
maidservant
of
Mrs.
Rushworth,
senior,
threatened
alarmingly.
He
was
doing
all
in
his
power
to
quiet
everything,
with
the
hope
of
Mrs.
Rushworth's
return,
but
was
so
much
counteracted
in
Wimpole
Street
by
the
influence
of
Mr.
Rushworth's
mother,
that
the
worst
consequences
might
be
apprehended.
This
dreadful
communication
could
not
be
kept
from
the
rest
of
the
family.
Sir
Thomas
set
off,
Edmund
would
go
with
him,
and
the
others
had
been
left
in
a
state
of
wretchedness,
inferior
only
to
what
followed
the
receipt
of
the
next
letters
from
London.
Everything
was
by
that
time
public
beyond
a
hope.
The
servant
of
Mrs.
Rushworth,
the
mother,
had
exposure
in
her
power,
and
supported
by
her
mistress,
was
not
to
be
silenced.
The
two
ladies,
even
in
the
short
time
they
had
been
together,
had
disagreed;
and
the
bitterness
of
the
elder
against
her
daughter
in
law
might
perhaps
arise
almost
as
much
from
the
personal
disrespect
with
which
she
had
herself
been
treated
as
from
sensibility
for
her
son.
However
that
might
be,
she
was
unmanageable.
But
had
she
been
less
obstinate,
or
of
less
weight
with
her
son,
who
was
always
guided
by
the
last
speaker,
by
the
person
who
could
get
hold
of
and
shut
him
up,
the
case
would
still
have
been
hopeless,
for
Mrs.
Rushworth
did
not
appear
again,
and
there
was
every
reason
to
conclude
her
to
be
concealed
somewhere
with
Mr.
Crawford,
who
had
quitted
his
uncle's
house,
as
for
a
journey,
on
the
very
day
of
her
absenting
herself.
Sir
Thomas,
however,
remained
yet
a
little
longer
in
town,
in
the
hope
of
discovering
and
snatching
her
from
farther
vice,
though
all
was
lost
on
the
side
of
character.
His
present
state
Fanny
could
hardly
bear
to
think
of.
There
was
but
one
of
his
children
who
was
not
at
this
time
a
source
of
misery
to
him.
Tom's
complaints
had
been
greatly
heightened
by
the
shock
of
his
sister's
conduct,
and
his
recovery
so
much
thrown
back
by
it,
that
even
Lady
Bertram
had
been
struck
by
the
difference,
and
all
her
alarms
were
regularly
sent
off
to
her
husband;
and
Julia's
elopement,
the
additional
blow
which
had
met
him
on
his
arrival
in
London,
though
its
force
had
been
deadened
at
the
moment,
must,
she
knew,
be
sorely
felt.
She
saw
that
it
was.
His
letters
expressed
how
much
he
deplored
it.
Under
any
circumstances
it
would
have
been
an
unwelcome
alliance;
but
to
have
it
so
clandestinely
formed,
and
such
a
period
chosen
for
its
completion,
placed
Julia's
feelings
in
a
most
unfavourable
light,
and
severely
aggravated
the
folly
of
her
choice.
He
called
it
a
bad
thing,
done
in
the
worst
manner,
and
at
the
worst
time;
and
though
Julia
was
yet
as
more
pardonable
than
Maria
as
folly
than
vice,
he
could
not
but
regard
the
step
she
had
taken
as
opening
the
worst
probabilities
of
a
conclusion
hereafter
like
her
sister's.
Such
was
his
opinion
of
the
set
into
which
she
had
thrown
herself.
Fanny
felt
for
him
most
acutely.
He
could
have
no
comfort
but
in
Edmund.
Every
other
child
must
be
racking
his
heart.
His
displeasure
against
herself
she
trusted,
reasoning
differently
from
Mrs.
Norris,
would
now
be
done
away.
She
should
be
justified.
Mr.
Crawford
would
have
fully
acquitted
her
conduct
in
refusing
him;
but
this,
though
most
material
to
herself,
would
be
poor
consolation
to
Sir
Thomas.
Her
uncle's
displeasure
was
terrible
to
her;
but
what
could
her
justification
or
her
gratitude
and
attachment
do
for
him?
His
stay
must
be
on
Edmund
alone.
She
was
mistaken,
however,
in
supposing
that
Edmund
gave
his
father
no
present
pain.
It
was
of
a
much
less
poignant
nature
than
what
the
others
excited;
but
Sir
Thomas
was
considering
his
happiness
as
very
deeply
involved
in
the
offence
of
his
sister
and
friend;
cut
off
by
it,
as
he
must
be,
from
the
woman
whom
he
had
been
pursuing
with
undoubted
attachment
and
strong
probability
of
success;
and
who,
in
everything
but
this
despicable
brother,
would
have
been
so
eligible
a
connexion.
He
was
aware
of
what
Edmund
must
be
suffering
on
his
own
behalf,
in
addition
to
all
the
rest,
when
they
were
in
town:
he
had
seen
or
conjectured
his
feelings;
and,
having
reason
to
think
that
one
interview
with
Miss
Crawford
had
taken
place,
from
which
Edmund
derived
only
increased
distress,
had
been
as
anxious
on
that
account
as
on
others
to
get
him
out
of
town,
and
had
engaged
him
in
taking
Fanny
home
to
her
aunt,
with
a
view
to
his
relief
and
benefit,
no
less
than
theirs.
Fanny
was
not
in
the
secret
of
her
uncle's
feelings,
Sir
Thomas
not
in
the
secret
of
Miss
Crawford's
character.
Had
he
been
privy
to
her
conversation
with
his
son,
he
would
not
have
wished
her
to
belong
to
him,
though
her
twenty
thousand
pounds
had
been
forty.
That
Edmund
must
be
for
ever
divided
from
Miss
Crawford
did
not
admit
of
a
doubt
with
Fanny;
and
yet,
till
she
knew
that
he
felt
the
same,
her
own
conviction
was
insufficient.
She
thought
he
did,
but
she
wanted
to
be
assured
of
it.
If
he
would
now
speak
to
her
with
the
unreserve
which
had
sometimes
been
too
much
for
her
before,
it
would
be
most
consoling;
but
that
she
found
was
not
to
be.
She
seldom
saw
him:
never
alone.
He
probably
avoided
being
alone
with
her.
What
was
to
be
inferred?
That
his
judgment
submitted
to
all
his
own
peculiar
and
bitter
share
of
this
family
affliction,
but
that
it
was
too
keenly
felt
to
be
a
subject
of
the
slightest
communication.
This
must
be
his
state.
He
yielded,
but
it
was
with
agonies
which
did
not
admit
of
speech.
Long,
long
would
it
be
ere
Miss
Crawford's
name
passed
his
lips
again,
or
she
could
hope
for
a
renewal
of
such
confidential
intercourse
as
had
been.
It
was
long.
They
reached
Mansfield
on
Thursday,
and
it
was
not
till
Sunday
evening
that
Edmund
began
to
talk
to
her
on
the
subject.
Sitting
with
her
on
Sunday
evening
a
wet
Sunday
evening
the
very
time
of
all
others
when,
if
a
friend
is
at
hand,
the
heart
must
be
opened,
and
everything
told;
no
one
else
in
the
room,
except
his
mother,
who,
after
hearing
an
affecting
sermon,
had
cried
herself
to
sleep,
it
was
impossible
not
to
speak;
and
so,
with
the
usual
beginnings,
hardly
to
be
traced
as
to
what
came
first,
and
the
usual
declaration
that
if
she
would
listen
to
him
for
a
few
minutes,
he
should
be
very
brief,
and
certainly
never
tax
her
kindness
in
the
same
way
again;
she
need
not
fear
a
repetition;
it
would
be
a
subject
prohibited
entirely:
he
entered
upon
the
luxury
of
relating
circumstances
and
sensations
of
the
first
interest
to
himself,
to
one
of
whose
affectionate
sympathy
he
was
quite
convinced.
How
Fanny
listened,
with
what
curiosity
and
concern,
what
pain
and
what
delight,
how
the
agitation
of
his
voice
was
watched,
and
how
carefully
her
own
eyes
were
fixed
on
any
object
but
himself,
may
be
imagined.
The
opening
was
alarming.
He
had
seen
Miss
Crawford.
He
had
been
invited
to
see
her.
He
had
received
a
note
from
Lady
Stornaway
to
beg
him
to
call;
and
regarding
it
as
what
was
meant
to
be
the
last,
last
interview
of
friendship,
and
investing
her
with
all
the
feelings
of
shame
and
wretchedness
which
Crawford's
sister
ought
to
have
known,
he
had
gone
to
her
in
such
a
state
of
mind,
so
softened,
so
devoted,
as
made
it
for
a
few
moments
impossible
to
Fanny's
fears
that
it
should
be
the
last.
But
as
he
proceeded
in
his
story,
these
fears
were
over.
She
had
met
him,
he
said,
with
a
serious
certainly
a
serious
even
an
agitated
air;
but
before
he
had
been
able
to
speak
one
intelligible
sentence,
she
had
introduced
the
subject
in
a
manner
which
he
owned
had
shocked
him.
"'I
heard
you
were
in
town,'
said
she;
'I
wanted
to
see
you.
Let
us
talk
over
this
sad
business.
What
can
equal
the
folly
of
our
two
relations?'
I
could
not
answer,
but
I
believe
my
looks
spoke.
She
felt
reproved.
Sometimes
how
quick
to
feel!
With
a
graver
look
and
voice
she
then
added,
'I
do
not
mean
to
defend
Henry
at
your
sister's
expense.'
So
she
began,
but
how
she
went
on,
Fanny,
is
not
fit,
is
hardly
fit
to
be
repeated
to
you.
I
cannot
recall
all
her
words.
I
would
not
dwell
upon
them
if
I
could.
Their
substance
was
great
anger
at
the
folly
of
each.
She
reprobated
her
brother's
folly
in
being
drawn
on
by
a
woman
whom
he
had
never
cared
for,
to
do
what
must
lose
him
the
woman
he
adored;
but
still
more
the
folly
of
poor
Maria,
in
sacrificing
such
a
situation,
plunging
into
such
difficulties,
under
the
idea
of
being
really
loved
by
a
man
who
had
long
ago
made
his
indifference
clear.
Guess
what
I
must
have
felt.
To
hear
the
woman
whom
no
harsher
name
than
folly
given!
So
voluntarily,
so
freely,
so
coolly
to
canvass
it!
No
reluctance,
no
horror,
no
feminine,
shall
I
say,
no
modest
loathings?
This
is
what
the
world
does.
For
where,
Fanny,
shall
we
find
a
woman
whom
nature
had
so
richly
endowed?
Spoilt,
spoilt!"
After
a
little
reflection,
he
went
on
with
a
sort
of
desperate
calmness.
"I
will
tell
you
everything,
and
then
have
done
for
ever.
She
saw
it
only
as
folly,
and
that
folly
stamped
only
by
exposure.
The
want
of
common
discretion,
of
caution:
his
going
down
to
Richmond
for
the
whole
time
of
her
being
at
Twickenham;
her
putting
herself
in
the
power
of
a
servant;
it
was
the
detection,
in
short
oh,
Fanny!
it
was
the
detection,
not
the
offence,
which
she
reprobated.
It
was
the
imprudence
which
had
brought
things
to
extremity,
and
obliged
her
brother
to
give
up
every
dearer
plan
in
order
to
fly
with
her."
He
stopt.
"And
what,"
said
Fanny
(believing
herself
required
to
speak),
"what
could
you
say?"
"Nothing,
nothing
to
be
understood.
I
was
like
a
man
stunned.
She
went
on,
began
to
talk
of
you;
yes,
then
she
began
to
talk
of
you,
regretting,
as
well
she
might,
the
loss
of
such
a
.
There
she
spoke
very
rationally.
But
she
has
always
done
justice
to
you.
'He
has
thrown
away,'
said
she,
'such
a
woman
as
he
will
never
see
again.
She
would
have
fixed
him;
she
would
have
made
him
happy
for
ever.'
My
dearest
Fanny,
I
am
giving
you,
I
hope,
more
pleasure
than
pain
by
this
retrospect
of
what
might
have
been
but
what
never
can
be
now.
You
do
not
wish
me
to
be
silent?
If
you
do,
give
me
but
a
look,
a
word,
and
I
have
done."
No
look
or
word
was
given.
"Thank
God,"
said
he.
"We
were
all
disposed
to
wonder,
but
it
seems
to
have
been
the
merciful
appointment
of
Providence
that
the
heart
which
knew
no
guile
should
not
suffer.
She
spoke
of
you
with
high
praise
and
warm
affection;
yet,
even
here,
there
was
alloy,
a
dash
of
evil;
for
in
the
midst
of
it
she
could
exclaim,
'Why
would
not
she
have
him?
It
is
all
her
fault.
Simple
girl!
I
shall
never
forgive
her.
Had
she
accepted
him
as
she
ought,
they
might
now
have
been
on
the
point
of
marriage,
and
Henry
would
have
been
too
happy
and
too
busy
to
want
any
other
object.
He
would
have
taken
no
pains
to
be
on
terms
with
Mrs.
Rushworth
again.
It
would
have
all
ended
in
a
regular
standing
flirtation,
in
yearly
meetings
at
Sotherton
and
Everingham.'
Could
you
have
believed
it
possible?
But
the
charm
is
broken.
My
eyes
are
opened."
"Cruel!"
said
Fanny,
"quite
cruel.
At
such
a
moment
to
give
way
to
gaiety,
to
speak
with
lightness,
and
to
you!
Absolute
cruelty."
"Cruelty,
do
you
call
it?
We
differ
there.
No,
hers
is
not
a
cruel
nature.
I
do
not
consider
her
as
meaning
to
wound
my
feelings.
The
evil
lies
yet
deeper:
in
her
total
ignorance,
unsuspiciousness
of
there
being
such
feelings;
in
a
perversion
of
mind
which
made
it
natural
to
her
to
treat
the
subject
as
she
did.
She
was
speaking
only
as
she
had
been
used
to
hear
others
speak,
as
she
imagined
everybody
else
would
speak.
Hers
are
not
faults
of
temper.
She
would
not
voluntarily
give
unnecessary
pain
to
any
one,
and
though
I
may
deceive
myself,
I
cannot
but
think
that
for
me,
for
my
feelings,
she
would
Hers
are
faults
of
principle,
Fanny;
of
blunted
delicacy
and
a
corrupted,
vitiated
mind.
Perhaps
it
is
best
for
me,
since
it
leaves
me
so
little
to
regret.
Not
so,
however.
Gladly
would
I
submit
to
all
the
increased
pain
of
losing
her,
rather
than
have
to
think
of
her
as
I
do.
I
told
her
so."
"Did
you?"
"Yes;
when
I
left
her
I
told
her
so."
"How
long
were
you
together?"
"Five
and
twenty
minutes.
Well,
she
went
on
to
say
that
what
remained
now
to
be
done
was
to
bring
about
a
marriage
between
them.
She
spoke
of
it,
Fanny,
with
a
steadier
voice
than
I
can."
He
was
obliged
to
pause
more
than
once
as
he
continued.
"'We
must
persuade
Henry
to
marry
her,'
said
she;
'and
what
with
honour,
and
the
certainty
of
having
shut
himself
out
for
ever
from
Fanny,
I
do
not
despair
of
it.
Fanny
he
must
give
up.
I
do
not
think
that
even
he
could
now
hope
to
succeed
with
one
of
her
stamp,
and
therefore
I
hope
we
may
find
no
insuperable
difficulty.
My
influence,
which
is
not
small
shall
all
go
that
way;
and
when
once
married,
and
properly
supported
by
her
own
family,
people
of
respectability
as
they
are,
she
may
recover
her
footing
in
society
to
a
certain
degree.
In
some
circles,
we
know,
she
would
never
be
admitted,
but
with
good
dinners,
and
large
parties,
there
will
always
be
those
who
will
be
glad
of
her
acquaintance;
and
there
is,
undoubtedly,
more
liberality
and
candour
on
those
points
than
formerly.
What
I
advise
is,
that
your
father
be
quiet.
Do
not
let
him
injure
his
own
cause
by
interference.
Persuade
him
to
let
things
take
their
course.
If
by
any
officious
exertions
of
his,
she
is
induced
to
leave
Henry's
protection,
there
will
be
much
less
chance
of
his
marrying
her
than
if
she
remain
with
him.
I
know
how
he
is
likely
to
be
influenced.
Let
Sir
Thomas
trust
to
his
honour
and
compassion,
and
it
may
all
end
well;
but
if
he
get
his
daughter
away,
it
will
be
destroying
the
chief
hold.'"
After
repeating
this,
Edmund
was
so
much
affected
that
Fanny,
watching
him
with
silent,
but
most
tender
concern,
was
almost
sorry
that
the
subject
had
been
entered
on
at
all.
It
was
long
before
he
could
speak
again.
At
last,
"Now,
Fanny,"
said
he,
"I
shall
soon
have
done.
I
have
told
you
the
substance
of
all
that
she
said.
As
soon
as
I
could
speak,
I
replied
that
I
had
not
supposed
it
possible,
coming
in
such
a
state
of
mind
into
that
house
as
I
had
done,
that
anything
could
occur
to
make
me
suffer
more,
but
that
she
had
been
inflicting
deeper
wounds
in
almost
every
sentence.
That
though
I
had,
in
the
course
of
our
acquaintance,
been
often
sensible
of
some
difference
in
our
opinions,
on
points,
too,
of
some
moment,
it
had
not
entered
my
imagination
to
conceive
the
difference
could
be
such
as
she
had
now
proved
it.
That
the
manner
in
which
she
treated
the
dreadful
crime
committed
by
her
brother
and
my
sister
(with
whom
lay
the
greater
seduction
I
pretended
not
to
say),
but
the
manner
in
which
she
spoke
of
the
crime
itself,
giving
it
every
reproach
but
the
right;
considering
its
ill
consequences
only
as
they
were
to
be
braved
or
overborne
by
a
defiance
of
decency
and
impudence
in
wrong;
and
last
of
all,
and
above
all,
recommending
to
us
a
compliance,
a
compromise,
an
acquiescence
in
the
continuance
of
the
sin,
on
the
chance
of
a
marriage
which,
thinking
as
I
now
thought
of
her
brother,
should
rather
be
prevented
than
sought;
all
this
together
most
grievously
convinced
me
that
I
had
never
understood
her
before,
and
that,
as
far
as
related
to
mind,
it
had
been
the
creature
of
my
own
imagination,
not
Miss
Crawford,
that
I
had
been
too
apt
to
dwell
on
for
many
months
past.
That,
perhaps,
it
was
best
for
me;
I
had
less
to
regret
in
sacrificing
a
friendship,
feelings,
hopes
which
must,
at
any
rate,
have
been
torn
from
me
now.
And
yet,
that
I
must
and
would
confess
that,
could
I
have
restored
her
to
what
she
had
appeared
to
me
before,
I
would
infinitely
prefer
any
increase
of
the
pain
of
parting,
for
the
sake
of
carrying
with
me
the
right
of
tenderness
and
esteem.
This
is
what
I
said,
the
purport
of
it;
but,
as
you
may
imagine,
not
spoken
so
collectedly
or
methodically
as
I
have
repeated
it
to
you.
She
was
astonished,
exceedingly
astonished
more
than
astonished.
I
saw
her
change
countenance.
She
turned
extremely
red.
I
imagined
I
saw
a
mixture
of
many
feelings:
a
great,
though
short
struggle;
half
a
wish
of
yielding
to
truths,
half
a
sense
of
shame,
but
habit,
habit
carried
it.
She
would
have
laughed
if
she
could.
It
was
a
sort
of
laugh,
as
she
answered,
'A
pretty
good
lecture,
upon
my
word.
Was
it
part
of
your
last
sermon?
At
this
rate
you
will
soon
reform
everybody
at
Mansfield
and
Thornton
Lacey;
and
when
I
hear
of
you
next,
it
may
be
as
a
celebrated
preacher
in
some
great
society
of
Methodists,
or
as
a
missionary
into
foreign
parts.'
She
tried
to
speak
carelessly,
but
she
was
not
so
careless
as
she
wanted
to
appear.
I
only
said
in
reply,
that
from
my
heart
I
wished
her
well,
and
earnestly
hoped
that
she
might
soon
learn
to
think
more
justly,
and
not
owe
the
most
valuable
knowledge
we
could
any
of
us
acquire,
the
knowledge
of
ourselves
and
of
our
duty,
to
the
lessons
of
affliction,
and
immediately
left
the
room.
I
had
gone
a
few
steps,
Fanny,
when
I
heard
the
door
open
behind
me.
'Mr.
Bertram,'
said
she.
I
looked
back.
'Mr.
Bertram,'
said
she,
with
a
smile;
but
it
was
a
smile
ill
suited
to
the
conversation
that
had
passed,
a
saucy
playful
smile,
seeming
to
invite
in
order
to
subdue
me;
at
least
it
appeared
so
to
me.
I
resisted;
it
was
the
impulse
of
the
moment
to
resist,
and
still
walked
on.
I
have
since,
sometimes,
for
a
moment,
regretted
that
I
did
not
go
back,
but
I
know
I
was
right,
and
such
has
been
the
end
of
our
acquaintance.
And
what
an
acquaintance
has
it
been!
How
have
I
been
deceived!
Equally
in
brother
and
sister
deceived!
I
thank
you
for
your
patience,
Fanny.
This
has
been
the
greatest
relief,
and
now
we
will
have
done."
And
such
was
Fanny's
dependence
on
his
words,
that
for
five
minutes
she
thought
they
had
done.
Then,
however,
it
all
came
on
again,
or
something
very
like
it,
and
nothing
less
than
Lady
Bertram's
rousing
thoroughly
up
could
really
close
such
a
conversation.
Till
that
happened,
they
continued
to
talk
of
Miss
Crawford
alone,
and
how
she
had
attached
him,
and
how
delightful
nature
had
made
her,
and
how
excellent
she
would
have
been,
had
she
fallen
into
good
hands
earlier.
Fanny,
now
at
liberty
to
speak
openly,
felt
more
than
justified
in
adding
to
his
knowledge
of
her
real
character,
by
some
hint
of
what
share
his
brother's
state
of
health
might
be
supposed
to
have
in
her
wish
for
a
complete
reconciliation.
This
was
not
an
agreeable
intimation.
Nature
resisted
it
for
a
while.
It
would
have
been
a
vast
deal
pleasanter
to
have
had
her
more
disinterested
in
her
attachment;
but
his
vanity
was
not
of
a
strength
to
fight
long
against
reason.
He
submitted
to
believe
that
Tom's
illness
had
influenced
her,
only
reserving
for
himself
this
consoling
thought,
that
considering
the
many
counteractions
of
opposing
habits,
she
had
certainly
been
more
attached
to
him
than
could
have
been
expected,
and
for
his
sake
been
more
near
doing
right.
Fanny
thought
exactly
the
same;
and
they
were
also
quite
agreed
in
their
opinion
of
the
lasting
effect,
the
indelible
impression,
which
such
a
disappointment
must
make
on
his
mind.
Time
would
undoubtedly
abate
somewhat
of
his
sufferings,
but
still
it
was
a
sort
of
thing
which
he
never
could
get
entirely
the
better
of;
and
as
to
his
ever
meeting
with
any
other
woman
who
could
it
was
too
impossible
to
be
named
but
with
indignation.
Fanny's
friendship
was
all
that
he
had
to
cling
to.
Let
other
pens
dwell
on
guilt
and
misery.
I
quit
such
odious
subjects
as
soon
as
I
can,
impatient
to
restore
everybody,
not
greatly
in
fault
themselves,
to
tolerable
comfort,
and
to
have
done
with
all
the
rest.
My
Fanny,
indeed,
at
this
very
time,
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing,
must
have
been
happy
in
spite
of
everything.
She
must
have
been
a
happy
creature
in
spite
of
all
that
she
felt,
or
thought
she
felt,
for
the
distress
of
those
around
her.
She
had
sources
of
delight
that
must
force
their
way.
She
was
returned
to
Mansfield
Park,
she
was
useful,
she
was
beloved;
she
was
safe
from
Mr.
Crawford;
and
when
Sir
Thomas
came
back
she
had
every
proof
that
could
be
given
in
his
then
melancholy
state
of
spirits,
of
his
perfect
approbation
and
increased
regard;
and
happy
as
all
this
must
make
her,
she
would
still
have
been
happy
without
any
of
it,
for
Edmund
was
no
longer
the
dupe
of
Miss
Crawford.
It
is
true
that
Edmund
was
very
far
from
happy
himself.
He
was
suffering
from
disappointment
and
regret,
grieving
over
what
was,
and
wishing
for
what
could
never
be.
She
knew
it
was
so,
and
was
sorry;
but
it
was
with
a
sorrow
so
founded
on
satisfaction,
so
tending
to
ease,
and
so
much
in
harmony
with
every
dearest
sensation,
that
there
are
few
who
might
not
have
been
glad
to
exchange
their
greatest
gaiety
for
it.
Sir
Thomas,
poor
Sir
Thomas,
a
parent,
and
conscious
of
errors
in
his
own
conduct
as
a
parent,
was
the
longest
to
suffer.
He
felt
that
he
ought
not
to
have
allowed
the
marriage;
that
his
daughter's
sentiments
had
been
sufficiently
known
to
him
to
render
him
culpable
in
authorising
it;
that
in
so
doing
he
had
sacrificed
the
right
to
the
expedient,
and
been
governed
by
motives
of
selfishness
and
worldly
wisdom.
These
were
reflections
that
required
some
time
to
soften;
but
time
will
do
almost
everything;
and
though
little
comfort
arose
on
Mrs.
Rushworth's
side
for
the
misery
she
had
occasioned,
comfort
was
to
be
found
greater
than
he
had
supposed
in
his
other
children.
Julia's
match
became
a
less
desperate
business
than
he
had
considered
it
at
first.
She
was
humble,
and
wishing
to
be
forgiven;
and
Mr.
Yates,
desirous
of
being
really
received
into
the
family,
was
disposed
to
look
up
to
him
and
be
guided.
He
was
not
very
solid;
but
there
was
a
hope
of
his
becoming
less
trifling,
of
his
being
at
least
tolerably
domestic
and
quiet;
and
at
any
rate,
there
was
comfort
in
finding
his
estate
rather
more,
and
his
debts
much
less,
than
he
had
feared,
and
in
being
consulted
and
treated
as
the
friend
best
worth
attending
to.
There
was
comfort
also
in
Tom,
who
gradually
regained
his
health,
without
regaining
the
thoughtlessness
and
selfishness
of
his
previous
habits.
He
was
the
better
for
ever
for
his
illness.
He
had
suffered,
and
he
had
learned
to
think:
two
advantages
that
he
had
never
known
before;
and
the
self
reproach
arising
from
the
deplorable
event
in
Wimpole
Street,
to
which
he
felt
himself
accessory
by
all
the
dangerous
intimacy
of
his
unjustifiable
theatre,
made
an
impression
on
his
mind
which,
at
the
age
of
six
and
twenty,
with
no
want
of
sense
or
good
companions,
was
durable
in
its
happy
effects.
He
became
what
he
ought
to
be:
useful
to
his
father,
steady
and
quiet,
and
not
living
merely
for
himself.
Here
was
comfort
indeed!
and
quite
as
soon
as
Sir
Thomas
could
place
dependence
on
such
sources
of
good,
Edmund
was
contributing
to
his
father's
ease
by
improvement
in
the
only
point
in
which
he
had
given
him
pain
before
improvement
in
his
spirits.
After
wandering
about
and
sitting
under
trees
with
Fanny
all
the
summer
evenings,
he
had
so
well
talked
his
mind
into
submission
as
to
be
very
tolerably
cheerful
again.
These
were
the
circumstances
and
the
hopes
which
gradually
brought
their
alleviation
to
Sir
Thomas,
deadening
his
sense
of
what
was
lost,
and
in
part
reconciling
him
to
himself;
though
the
anguish
arising
from
the
conviction
of
his
own
errors
in
the
education
of
his
daughters
was
never
to
be
entirely
done
away.
Too
late
he
became
aware
how
unfavourable
to
the
character
of
any
young
people
must
be
the
totally
opposite
treatment
which
Maria
and
Julia
had
been
always
experiencing
at
home,
where
the
excessive
indulgence
and
flattery
of
their
aunt
had
been
continually
contrasted
with
his
own
severity.
He
saw
how
ill
he
had
judged,
in
expecting
to
counteract
what
was
wrong
in
Mrs.
Norris
by
its
reverse
in
himself;
clearly
saw
that
he
had
but
increased
the
evil
by
teaching
them
to
repress
their
spirits
in
his
presence
so
as
to
make
their
real
disposition
unknown
to
him,
and
sending
them
for
all
their
indulgences
to
a
person
who
had
been
able
to
attach
them
only
by
the
blindness
of
her
affection,
and
the
excess
of
her
praise.
Here
had
been
grievous
mismanagement;
but,
bad
as
it
was,
he
gradually
grew
to
feel
that
it
had
not
been
the
most
direful
mistake
in
his
plan
of
education.
Something
must
have
been
wanting
within,
or
time
would
have
worn
away
much
of
its
ill
effect.
He
feared
that
principle,
active
principle,
had
been
wanting;
that
they
had
never
been
properly
taught
to
govern
their
inclinations
and
tempers
by
that
sense
of
duty
which
can
alone
suffice.
They
had
been
instructed
theoretically
in
their
religion,
but
never
required
to
bring
it
into
daily
practice.
To
be
distinguished
for
elegance
and
accomplishments,
the
authorised
object
of
their
youth,
could
have
had
no
useful
influence
that
way,
no
moral
effect
on
the
mind.
He
had
meant
them
to
be
good,
but
his
cares
had
been
directed
to
the
understanding
and
manners,
not
the
disposition;
and
of
the
necessity
of
self
denial
and
humility,
he
feared
they
had
never
heard
from
any
lips
that
could
profit
them.
Bitterly
did
he
deplore
a
deficiency
which
now
he
could
scarcely
comprehend
to
have
been
possible.
Wretchedly
did
he
feel,
that
with
all
the
cost
and
care
of
an
anxious
and
expensive
education,
he
had
brought
up
his
daughters
without
their
understanding
their
first
duties,
or
his
being
acquainted
with
their
character
and
temper.
The
high
spirit
and
strong
passions
of
Mrs.
Rushworth,
especially,
were
made
known
to
him
only
in
their
sad
result.
She
was
not
to
be
prevailed
on
to
leave
Mr.
Crawford.
She
hoped
to
marry
him,
and
they
continued
together
till
she
was
obliged
to
be
convinced
that
such
hope
was
vain,
and
till
the
disappointment
and
wretchedness
arising
from
the
conviction
rendered
her
temper
so
bad,
and
her
feelings
for
him
so
like
hatred,
as
to
make
them
for
a
while
each
other's
punishment,
and
then
induce
a
voluntary
separation.
She
had
lived
with
him
to
be
reproached
as
the
ruin
of
all
his
happiness
in
Fanny,
and
carried
away
no
better
consolation
in
leaving
him
than
that
she
had
divided
them.
What
can
exceed
the
misery
of
such
a
mind
in
such
a
situation?
Mr.
Rushworth
had
no
difficulty
in
procuring
a
divorce;
and
so
ended
a
marriage
contracted
under
such
circumstances
as
to
make
any
better
end
the
effect
of
good
luck
not
to
be
reckoned
on.
She
had
despised
him,
and
loved
another;
and
he
had
been
very
much
aware
that
it
was
so.
The
indignities
of
stupidity,
and
the
disappointments
of
selfish
passion,
can
excite
little
pity.
His
punishment
followed
his
conduct,
as
did
a
deeper
punishment
the
deeper
guilt
of
his
wife.
He
was
released
from
the
engagement
to
be
mortified
and
unhappy,
till
some
other
pretty
girl
could
attract
him
into
matrimony
again,
and
he
might
set
forward
on
a
second,
and,
it
is
to
be
hoped,
more
prosperous
trial
of
the
state:
if
duped,
to
be
duped
at
least
with
good
humour
and
good
luck;
while
she
must
withdraw
with
infinitely
stronger
feelings
to
a
retirement
and
reproach
which
could
allow
no
second
spring
of
hope
or
character.
Where
she
could
be
placed
became
a
subject
of
most
melancholy
and
momentous
consultation.
Mrs.
Norris,
whose
attachment
seemed
to
augment
with
the
demerits
of
her
niece,
would
have
had
her
received
at
home
and
countenanced
by
them
all.
Sir
Thomas
would
not
hear
of
it;
and
Mrs.
Norris's
anger
against
Fanny
was
so
much
the
greater,
from
considering
her
residence
there
as
the
motive.
She
persisted
in
placing
his
scruples
to
her
account,
though
Sir
Thomas
very
solemnly
assured
her
that,
had
there
been
no
young
woman
in
question,
had
there
been
no
young
person
of
either
sex
belonging
to
him,
to
be
endangered
by
the
society
or
hurt
by
the
character
of
Mrs.
Rushworth,
he
would
never
have
offered
so
great
an
insult
to
the
neighbourhood
as
to
expect
it
to
notice
her.
As
a
daughter,
he
hoped
a
penitent
one,
she
should
be
protected
by
him,
and
secured
in
every
comfort,
and
supported
by
every
encouragement
to
do
right,
which
their
relative
situations
admitted;
but
farther
than
that
he
could
not
go.
Maria
had
destroyed
her
own
character,
and
he
would
not,
by
a
vain
attempt
to
restore
what
never
could
be
restored,
by
affording
his
sanction
to
vice,
or
in
seeking
to
lessen
its
disgrace,
be
anywise
accessory
to
introducing
such
misery
in
another
man's
family
as
he
had
known
himself.
It
ended
in
Mrs.
Norris's
resolving
to
quit
Mansfield
and
devote
herself
to
her
unfortunate
Maria,
and
in
an
establishment
being
formed
for
them
in
another
country,
remote
and
private,
where,
shut
up
together
with
little
society,
on
one
side
no
affection,
on
the
other
no
judgment,
it
may
be
reasonably
supposed
that
their
tempers
became
their
mutual
punishment.
Mrs.
Norris's
removal
from
Mansfield
was
the
great
supplementary
comfort
of
Sir
Thomas's
life.
His
opinion
of
her
had
been
sinking
from
the
day
of
his
return
from
Antigua:
in
every
transaction
together
from
that
period,
in
their
daily
intercourse,
in
business,
or
in
chat,
she
had
been
regularly
losing
ground
in
his
esteem,
and
convincing
him
that
either
time
had
done
her
much
disservice,
or
that
he
had
considerably
over
rated
her
sense,
and
wonderfully
borne
with
her
manners
before.
He
had
felt
her
as
an
hourly
evil,
which
was
so
much
the
worse,
as
there
seemed
no
chance
of
its
ceasing
but
with
life;
she
seemed
a
part
of
himself
that
must
be
borne
for
ever.
To
be
relieved
from
her,
therefore,
was
so
great
a
felicity
that,
had
she
not
left
bitter
remembrances
behind
her,
there
might
have
been
danger
of
his
learning
almost
to
approve
the
evil
which
produced
such
a
good.
She
was
regretted
by
no
one
at
Mansfield.
She
had
never
been
able
to
attach
even
those
she
loved
best;
and
since
Mrs.
Rushworth's
elopement,
her
temper
had
been
in
a
state
of
such
irritation
as
to
make
her
everywhere
tormenting.
Not
even
Fanny
had
tears
for
aunt
Norris,
not
even
when
she
was
gone
for
ever.
That
Julia
escaped
better
than
Maria
was
owing,
in
some
measure,
to
a
favourable
difference
of
disposition
and
circumstance,
but
in
a
greater
to
her
having
been
less
the
darling
of
that
very
aunt,
less
flattered
and
less
spoilt.
Her
beauty
and
acquirements
had
held
but
a
second
place.
She
had
been
always
used
to
think
herself
a
little
inferior
to
Maria.
Her
temper
was
naturally
the
easiest
of
the
two;
her
feelings,
though
quick,
were
more
controllable,
and
education
had
not
given
her
so
very
hurtful
a
degree
of
self
consequence.
She
had
submitted
the
best
to
the
disappointment
in
Henry
Crawford.
After
the
first
bitterness
of
the
conviction
of
being
slighted
was
over,
she
had
been
tolerably
soon
in
a
fair
way
of
not
thinking
of
him
again;
and
when
the
acquaintance
was
renewed
in
town,
and
Mr.
Rushworth's
house
became
Crawford's
object,
she
had
had
the
merit
of
withdrawing
herself
from
it,
and
of
chusing
that
time
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
other
friends,
in
order
to
secure
herself
from
being
again
too
much
attracted.
This
had
been
her
motive
in
going
to
her
cousin's.
Mr.
Yates's
convenience
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
She
had
been
allowing
his
attentions
some
time,
but
with
very
little
idea
of
ever
accepting
him;
and
had
not
her
sister's
conduct
burst
forth
as
it
did,
and
her
increased
dread
of
her
father
and
of
home,
on
that
event,
imagining
its
certain
consequence
to
herself
would
be
greater
severity
and
restraint,
made
her
hastily
resolve
on
avoiding
such
immediate
horrors
at
all
risks,
it
is
probable
that
Mr.
Yates
would
never
have
succeeded.
She
had
not
eloped
with
any
worse
feelings
than
those
of
selfish
alarm.
It
had
appeared
to
her
the
only
thing
to
be
done.
Maria's
guilt
had
induced
Julia's
folly.
Henry
Crawford,
ruined
by
early
independence
and
bad
domestic
example,
indulged
in
the
freaks
of
a
cold
blooded
vanity
a
little
too
long.
Once
it
had,
by
an
opening
undesigned
and
unmerited,
led
him
into
the
way
of
happiness.
Could
he
have
been
satisfied
with
the
conquest
of
one
amiable
woman's
affections,
could
he
have
found
sufficient
exultation
in
overcoming
the
reluctance,
in
working
himself
into
the
esteem
and
tenderness
of
Fanny
Price,
there
would
have
been
every
probability
of
success
and
felicity
for
him.
His
affection
had
already
done
something.
Her
influence
over
him
had
already
given
him
some
influence
over
her.
Would
he
have
deserved
more,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
more
would
have
been
obtained,
especially
when
that
marriage
had
taken
place,
which
would
have
given
him
the
assistance
of
her
conscience
in
subduing
her
first
inclination,
and
brought
them
very
often
together.
Would
he
have
persevered,
and
uprightly,
Fanny
must
have
been
his
reward,
and
a
reward
very
voluntarily
bestowed,
within
a
reasonable
period
from
Edmund's
marrying
Mary.
Had
he
done
as
he
intended,
and
as
he
knew
he
ought,
by
going
down
to
Everingham
after
his
return
from
Portsmouth,
he
might
have
been
deciding
his
own
happy
destiny.
But
he
was
pressed
to
stay
for
Mrs.
Fraser's
party;
his
staying
was
made
of
flattering
consequence,
and
he
was
to
meet
Mrs.
Rushworth
there.
Curiosity
and
vanity
were
both
engaged,
and
the
temptation
of
immediate
pleasure
was
too
strong
for
a
mind
unused
to
make
any
sacrifice
to
right:
he
resolved
to
defer
his
Norfolk
journey,
resolved
that
writing
should
answer
the
purpose
of
it,
or
that
its
purpose
was
unimportant,
and
staid.
He
saw
Mrs.
Rushworth,
was
received
by
her
with
a
coldness
which
ought
to
have
been
repulsive,
and
have
established
apparent
indifference
between
them
for
ever;
but
he
was
mortified,
he
could
not
bear
to
be
thrown
off
by
the
woman
whose
smiles
had
been
so
wholly
at
his
command:
he
must
exert
himself
to
subdue
so
proud
a
display
of
resentment;
it
was
anger
on
Fanny's
account;
he
must
get
the
better
of
it,
and
make
Mrs.
Rushworth
Maria
Bertram
again
in
her
treatment
of
himself.
In
this
spirit
he
began
the
attack,
and
by
animated
perseverance
had
soon
re
established
the
sort
of
familiar
intercourse,
of
gallantry,
of
flirtation,
which
bounded
his
views;
but
in
triumphing
over
the
discretion
which,
though
beginning
in
anger,
might
have
saved
them
both,
he
had
put
himself
in
the
power
of
feelings
on
her
side
more
strong
than
he
had
supposed.
She
loved
him;
there
was
no
withdrawing
attentions
avowedly
dear
to
her.
He
was
entangled
by
his
own
vanity,
with
as
little
excuse
of
love
as
possible,
and
without
the
smallest
inconstancy
of
mind
towards
her
cousin.
To
keep
Fanny
and
the
Bertrams
from
a
knowledge
of
what
was
passing
became
his
first
object.
Secrecy
could
not
have
been
more
desirable
for
Mrs.
Rushworth's
credit
than
he
felt
it
for
his
own.
When
he
returned
from
Richmond,
he
would
have
been
glad
to
see
Mrs.
Rushworth
no
more.
All
that
followed
was
the
result
of
her
imprudence;
and
he
went
off
with
her
at
last,
because
he
could
not
help
it,
regretting
Fanny
even
at
the
moment,
but
regretting
her
infinitely
more
when
all
the
bustle
of
the
intrigue
was
over,
and
a
very
few
months
had
taught
him,
by
the
force
of
contrast,
to
place
a
yet
higher
value
on
the
sweetness
of
her
temper,
the
purity
of
her
mind,
and
the
excellence
of
her
principles.
That
punishment,
the
public
punishment
of
disgrace,
should
in
a
just
measure
attend
his
share
of
the
offence
is,
we
know,
not
one
of
the
barriers
which
society
gives
to
virtue.
In
this
world
the
penalty
is
less
equal
than
could
be
wished;
but
without
presuming
to
look
forward
to
a
juster
appointment
hereafter,
we
may
fairly
consider
a
man
of
sense,
like
Henry
Crawford,
to
be
providing
for
himself
no
small
portion
of
vexation
and
regret:
vexation
that
must
rise
sometimes
to
self
reproach,
and
regret
to
wretchedness,
in
having
so
requited
hospitality,
so
injured
family
peace,
so
forfeited
his
best,
most
estimable,
and
endeared
acquaintance,
and
so
lost
the
woman
whom
he
had
rationally
as
well
as
passionately
loved.
After
what
had
passed
to
wound
and
alienate
the
two
families,
the
continuance
of
the
Bertrams
and
Grants
in
such
close
neighbourhood
would
have
been
most
distressing;
but
the
absence
of
the
latter,
for
some
months
purposely
lengthened,
ended
very
fortunately
in
the
necessity,
or
at
least
the
practicability,
of
a
permanent
removal.
Dr.
Grant,
through
an
interest
on
which
he
had
almost
ceased
to
form
hopes,
succeeded
to
a
stall
in
Westminster,
which,
as
affording
an
occasion
for
leaving
Mansfield,
an
excuse
for
residence
in
London,
and
an
increase
of
income
to
answer
the
expenses
of
the
change,
was
highly
acceptable
to
those
who
went
and
those
who
staid.
Mrs.
Grant,
with
a
temper
to
love
and
be
loved,
must
have
gone
with
some
regret
from
the
scenes
and
people
she
had
been
used
to;
but
the
same
happiness
of
disposition
must
in
any
place,
and
any
society,
secure
her
a
great
deal
to
enjoy,
and
she
had
again
a
home
to
offer
Mary;
and
Mary
had
had
enough
of
her
own
friends,
enough
of
vanity,
ambition,
love,
and
disappointment
in
the
course
of
the
last
half
year,
to
be
in
need
of
the
true
kindness
of
her
sister's
heart,
and
the
rational
tranquillity
of
her
ways.
They
lived
together;
and
when
Dr.
Grant
had
brought
on
apoplexy
and
death,
by
three
great
institutionary
dinners
in
one
week,
they
still
lived
together;
for
Mary,
though
perfectly
resolved
against
ever
attaching
herself
to
a
younger
brother
again,
was
long
in
finding
among
the
dashing
representatives,
or
idle
heir
apparents,
who
were
at
the
command
of
her
beauty,
and
her
Ł20,000,
any
one
who
could
satisfy
the
better
taste
she
had
acquired
at
Mansfield,
whose
character
and
manners
could
authorise
a
hope
of
the
domestic
happiness
she
had
there
learned
to
estimate,
or
put
Edmund
Bertram
sufficiently
out
of
her
head.
Edmund
had
greatly
the
advantage
of
her
in
this
respect.
He
had
not
to
wait
and
wish
with
vacant
affections
for
an
object
worthy
to
succeed
her
in
them.
Scarcely
had
he
done
regretting
Mary
Crawford,
and
observing
to
Fanny
how
impossible
it
was
that
he
should
ever
meet
with
such
another
woman,
before
it
began
to
strike
him
whether
a
very
different
kind
of
woman
might
not
do
just
as
well,
or
a
great
deal
better:
whether
Fanny
herself
were
not
growing
as
dear,
as
important
to
him
in
all
her
smiles
and
all
her
ways,
as
Mary
Crawford
had
ever
been;
and
whether
it
might
not
be
a
possible,
an
hopeful
undertaking
to
persuade
her
that
her
warm
and
sisterly
regard
for
him
would
be
foundation
enough
for
wedded
love.
I
purposely
abstain
from
dates
on
this
occasion,
that
every
one
may
be
at
liberty
to
fix
their
own,
aware
that
the
cure
of
unconquerable
passions,
and
the
transfer
of
unchanging
attachments,
must
vary
much
as
to
time
in
different
people.
I
only
entreat
everybody
to
believe
that
exactly
at
the
time
when
it
was
quite
natural
that
it
should
be
so,
and
not
a
week
earlier,
Edmund
did
cease
to
care
about
Miss
Crawford,
and
became
as
anxious
to
marry
Fanny
as
Fanny
herself
could
desire.
With
such
a
regard
for
her,
indeed,
as
his
had
long
been,
a
regard
founded
on
the
most
endearing
claims
of
innocence
and
helplessness,
and
completed
by
every
recommendation
of
growing
worth,
what
could
be
more
natural
than
the
change?
Loving,
guiding,
protecting
her,
as
he
had
been
doing
ever
since
her
being
ten
years
old,
her
mind
in
so
great
a
degree
formed
by
his
care,
and
her
comfort
depending
on
his
kindness,
an
object
to
him
of
such
close
and
peculiar
interest,
dearer
by
all
his
own
importance
with
her
than
any
one
else
at
Mansfield,
what
was
there
now
to
add,
but
that
he
should
learn
to
prefer
soft
light
eyes
to
sparkling
dark
ones.
And
being
always
with
her,
and
always
talking
confidentially,
and
his
feelings
exactly
in
that
favourable
state
which
a
recent
disappointment
gives,
those
soft
light
eyes
could
not
be
very
long
in
obtaining
the
pre
eminence.
Having
once
set
out,
and
felt
that
he
had
done
so
on
this
road
to
happiness,
there
was
nothing
on
the
side
of
prudence
to
stop
him
or
make
his
progress
slow;
no
doubts
of
her
deserving,
no
fears
of
opposition
of
taste,
no
need
of
drawing
new
hopes
of
happiness
from
dissimilarity
of
temper.
Her
mind,
disposition,
opinions,
and
habits
wanted
no
half
concealment,
no
self
deception
on
the
present,
no
reliance
on
future
improvement.
Even
in
the
midst
of
his
late
infatuation,
he
had
acknowledged
Fanny's
mental
superiority.
What
must
be
his
sense
of
it
now,
therefore?
She
was
of
course
only
too
good
for
him;
but
as
nobody
minds
having
what
is
too
good
for
them,
he
was
very
steadily
earnest
in
the
pursuit
of
the
blessing,
and
it
was
not
possible
that
encouragement
from
her
should
be
long
wanting.
Timid,
anxious,
doubting
as
she
was,
it
was
still
impossible
that
such
tenderness
as
hers
should
not,
at
times,
hold
out
the
strongest
hope
of
success,
though
it
remained
for
a
later
period
to
tell
him
the
whole
delightful
and
astonishing
truth.
His
happiness
in
knowing
himself
to
have
been
so
long
the
beloved
of
such
a
heart,
must
have
been
great
enough
to
warrant
any
strength
of
language
in
which
he
could
clothe
it
to
her
or
to
himself;
it
must
have
been
a
delightful
happiness.
But
there
was
happiness
elsewhere
which
no
description
can
reach.
Let
no
one
presume
to
give
the
feelings
of
a
young
woman
on
receiving
the
assurance
of
that
affection
of
which
she
has
scarcely
allowed
herself
to
entertain
a
hope.
Their
own
inclinations
ascertained,
there
were
no
difficulties
behind,
no
drawback
of
poverty
or
parent.
It
was
a
match
which
Sir
Thomas's
wishes
had
even
forestalled.
Sick
of
ambitious
and
mercenary
connexions,
prizing
more
and
more
the
sterling
good
of
principle
and
temper,
and
chiefly
anxious
to
bind
by
the
strongest
securities
all
that
remained
to
him
of
domestic
felicity,
he
had
pondered
with
genuine
satisfaction
on
the
more
than
possibility
of
the
two
young
friends
finding
their
natural
consolation
in
each
other
for
all
that
had
occurred
of
disappointment
to
either;
and
the
joyful
consent
which
met
Edmund's
application,
the
high
sense
of
having
realised
a
great
acquisition
in
the
promise
of
Fanny
for
a
daughter,
formed
just
such
a
contrast
with
his
early
opinion
on
the
subject
when
the
poor
little
girl's
coming
had
been
first
agitated,
as
time
is
for
ever
producing
between
the
plans
and
decisions
of
mortals,
for
their
own
instruction,
and
their
neighbours'
entertainment.
Fanny
was
indeed
the
daughter
that
he
wanted.
His
charitable
kindness
had
been
rearing
a
prime
comfort
for
himself.
His
liberality
had
a
rich
repayment,
and
the
general
goodness
of
his
intentions
by
her
deserved
it.
He
might
have
made
her
childhood
happier;
but
it
had
been
an
error
of
judgment
only
which
had
given
him
the
appearance
of
harshness,
and
deprived
him
of
her
early
love;
and
now,
on
really
knowing
each
other,
their
mutual
attachment
became
very
strong.
After
settling
her
at
Thornton
Lacey
with
every
kind
attention
to
her
comfort,
the
object
of
almost
every
day
was
to
see
her
there,
or
to
get
her
away
from
it.
Selfishly
dear
as
she
had
long
been
to
Lady
Bertram,
she
could
not
be
parted
with
willingly
by
her.
No
happiness
of
son
or
niece
could
make
her
wish
the
marriage.
But
it
was
possible
to
part
with
her,
because
Susan
remained
to
supply
her
place.
Susan
became
the
stationary
niece,
delighted
to
be
so;
and
equally
well
adapted
for
it
by
a
readiness
of
mind,
and
an
inclination
for
usefulness,
as
Fanny
had
been
by
sweetness
of
temper,
and
strong
feelings
of
gratitude.
Susan
could
never
be
spared.
First
as
a
comfort
to
Fanny,
then
as
an
auxiliary,
and
last
as
her
substitute,
she
was
established
at
Mansfield,
with
every
appearance
of
equal
permanency.
Her
more
fearless
disposition
and
happier
nerves
made
everything
easy
to
her
there.
With
quickness
in
understanding
the
tempers
of
those
she
had
to
deal
with,
and
no
natural
timidity
to
restrain
any
consequent
wishes,
she
was
soon
welcome
and
useful
to
all;
and
after
Fanny's
removal
succeeded
so
naturally
to
her
influence
over
the
hourly
comfort
of
her
aunt,
as
gradually
to
become,
perhaps,
the
most
beloved
of
the
two.
In
her
usefulness,
in
Fanny's
excellence,
in
William's
continued
good
conduct
and
rising
fame,
and
in
the
general
well
doing
and
success
of
the
other
members
of
the
family,
all
assisting
to
advance
each
other,
and
doing
credit
to
his
countenance
and
aid,
Sir
Thomas
saw
repeated,
and
for
ever
repeated,
reason
to
rejoice
in
what
he
had
done
for
them
all,
and
acknowledge
the
advantages
of
early
hardship
and
discipline,
and
the
consciousness
of
being
born
to
struggle
and
endure.
With
so
much
true
merit
and
true
love,
and
no
want
of
fortune
and
friends,
the
happiness
of
the
married
cousins
must
appear
as
secure
as
earthly
happiness
can
be.
Equally
formed
for
domestic
life,
and
attached
to
country
pleasures,
their
home
was
the
home
of
affection
and
comfort;
and
to
complete
the
picture
of
good,
the
acquisition
of
Mansfield
living,
by
the
death
of
Dr.
Grant,
occurred
just
after
they
had
been
married
long
enough
to
begin
to
want
an
increase
of
income,
and
feel
their
distance
from
the
paternal
abode
an
inconvenience.
On
that
event
they
removed
to
Mansfield;
and
the
Parsonage
there,
which,
under
each
of
its
two
former
owners,
Fanny
had
never
been
able
to
approach
but
with
some
painful
sensation
of
restraint
or
alarm,
soon
grew
as
dear
to
her
heart,
and
as
thoroughly
perfect
in
her
eyes,
as
everything
else
within
the
view
and
patronage
of
Mansfield
Park
had
