The
secret
is
how
to
die.
Since
the
beginning
of
time,
the
secret
had
always
been
how
to
die.
The
thirty-four-year-old
initiate
gazed
down
at
the
human
skull
cradled
in
his
palms.
The
skull
was
hollow,
like
a
bowl,
filled
with
bloodred
wine.
Drink
it,
he
told
himself.
You
have
nothing
to
fear.
As
was
tradition,
he
had
begun
this
journey
adorned
in
the
ritualistic
garb
of
a
medieval
heretic
being
led
to
the
gallows,
his
loose-fitting
shirt
gaping
open
to
reveal
his
pale
chest,
his
left
pant
leg
rolled
up
to
the
knee,
and
his
right
sleeve
rolled
up
to
the
elbow.
Around
his
neck
hung
a
heavy
rope
noose
a
"cable-tow"
as
the
brethren
called
it.
Tonight,
however,
like
the
brethren
bearing
witness,
he
was
dressed
as
a
master.
The
assembly
of
brothers
encircling
him
all
were
adorned
in
their
full
regalia
of
lambskin
aprons,
sashes,
and
white
gloves.
Around
their
necks
hung
ceremonial
jewels
that
glistened
like
ghostly
eyes
in
the
muted
light.
Many
of
these
men
held
powerful
stations
in
life,
and
yet
the
initiate
knew
their
worldly
ranks
meant
nothing
within
these
walls.
Here
all
men
were
equals,
sworn
brothers
sharing
a
mystical
bond.
As
he
surveyed
the
daunting
assembly,
the
initiate
wondered
who
on
the
outside
would
ever
believe
that
this
collection
of
men
would
assemble
in
one
place
much
less
this
place.
The
room
looked
like
a
holy
sanctuary
from
the
ancient
world.
The
truth,
however,
was
stranger
still.
/
am
just
blocks
away
from
the
White
House.
This
colossal
edifice,
located
at
1733
Sixteenth
Street
NW
in
Washington,
D.C.,
was
a
replica
of
a
pre-
Christian
temple
the
temple
of
King
Mausolus,
the
original
mausoleum
a
place
to
be
taken
after
death.
Outside
the
main
entrance,
two
seventeen-ton
sphinxes
guarded
the
bronze
doors.
The
interior
was
an
ornate
labyrinth
of
ritualistic
chambers,
halls,
sealed
vaults,
libraries,
and
even
a
hollow
wall
that
held
the
remains
of
two
human
bodies.
The
initiate
had
been
told
every
room
in
this
building
held
a
secret,
and
yet
he
knew
no
room
held
deeper
secrets
than
the
gigantic
chamber
in
which
he
was
currently
kneeling
with
a
skull
cradled
in
his
palms.
The
Temple
Room.
This
room
was
a
perfect
square.
And
cavernous.
The
ceiling
soared
an
astonishing
one
hundred
feet
overhead,
supported
by
monolithic
columns
of
green
granite.
A
tiered
gallery
of
dark
Russian
walnut
seats
with
hand-tooled
pigskin
encircled
the
room.
A
thirty-three-foot-tall
throne
dominated
the
western
wall,
with
a
concealed
pipe
organ
opposite
it.
The
walls
were
a
kaleidoscope
of
ancient
symbols
Egyptian,
Hebraic,
astronomical,
alchemical,
and
others
yet
unknown.
Tonight,
the
Temple
Room
was
lit
by
a
series
of
precisely
arranged
candles.
Their
dim
glow
was
aided
only
by
a
pale
shaft
of
moonlight
that
filtered
down
through
the
expansive
oculus
in
the
ceiling
and
illuminated
the
room's
most
startling
feature
an
enormous
altar
hewn
from
a
solid
block
of
polished
Belgian
black
marble,
situated
dead
center
of
the
square
chamber.
The
secret
is
how
to
die,
the
initiate
reminded
himself.
"It
is
time,"
a
voice
whispered.
The
initiate
let
his
gaze
climb
the
distinguished
white
-robed
figure
standing
before
him.
The
Supreme
Worshipful
Master.
The
man,
in
his
late
fifties,
was
an
American
icon,
well
loved,
robust,
and
incalculably
wealthy.
His
once-dark
hair
was
turning
silver,
and
his
famous
visage
reflected
a
lifetime
of
power
and
a
vigorous
intellect.
"Take
the
oath,"
the
Worshipful
Master
said,
his
voice
soft
like
falling
snow.
"Complete
your
journey."
The
initiate's
journey,
like
all
such
journeys,
had
begun
at
the
first
degree.
On
that
night,
in
a
ritual
similar
to
this
one,
the
Worshipful
Master
had
blindfolded
him
with
a
velvet
hoodwink
and
pressed
a
ceremonial
dagger
to
his
bare
chest,
demanding:
"Do
you
seriously
declare
on
your
honor,
uninfluenced
by
mercenary
or
any
other
unworthy
motive,
that
you
freely
and
voluntarily
offer
yourself
as
a
candidate
for
the
mysteries
and
privileges
of
this
brotherhood?"
"I
do,"
the
initiate
had
lied.
"Then
let
this
be
a
sting
to
your
consciousness,"
the
master
had
warned
him,
"as
well
as
instant
death
should
you
ever
betray
the
secrets
to
be
imparted
to
you."
At
the
time,
the
initiate
had
felt
no
fear.
They
will
never
know
my
true
purpose
here.
Tonight,
however,
he
sensed
a
foreboding
solemnity
in
the
Temple
Room,
and
his
mind
began
replaying
all
the
dire
warnings
he
had
been
given
on
his
journey,
threats
of
terrible
consequences
if
he
ever
shared
the
ancient
secrets
he
was
about
to
learn:
Throat
cut
from
ear
to
ear
tongue
torn
out
by
its
roots
bowels
taken
out
and
burned
scattered
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
heart
plucked
out
and
given
to
the
beasts
of
the
field
"Brother,"
the
gray-eyed
master
said,
placing
his
left
hand
on
the
initiate's
shoulder.
"Take
the
final
oath."
Steeling
himself
for
the
last
step
of
his
journey,
the
initiate
shifted
his
muscular
frame
and
turned
his
attention
back
to
the
skull
cradled
in
his
palms.
The
crimson
wine
looked
almost
black
in
the
dim
candlelight.
The
chamber
had
fallen
deathly
silent,
and
he
could
feel
all
of
the
witnesses
watching
him,
waiting
for
him
to
take
his
final
oath
and
join
their
elite
ranks.
Tonight,
he
thought,
something
is
taking
place
within
these
walls
that
has
never
before
occurred
in
the
history
of
this
brotherhood.
Not
once,
in
centuries.
He
knew
it
would
be
the
spark
and
it
would
give
him
unfathomable
power.
Energized,
he
drew
a
breath
and
spoke
aloud
the
same
words
that
countless
men
had
spoken
before
him
in
countries
all
over
the
world.
"May
this
wine
I
now
drink
become
a
deadly
poison
to
me
should
I
ever
knowingly
or
willfully
violate
my
oath.
His
words
echoed
in
the
hollow
space.
Then
all
was
quiet.
Steadying
his
hands,
the
initiate
raised
the
skull
to
his
mouth
and
felt
his
lips
touch
the
dry
bone.
He
closed
his
eyes
and
tipped
the
skull
toward
his
mouth,
drinking
the
wine
in
long,
deep
swallows.
When
the
last
drop
was
gone,
he
lowered
the
skull.
For
an
instant,
he
thought
he
felt
his
lungs
growing
tight,
and
his
heart
began
to
pound
wildly.
My
God,
they
know!
Then,
as
quickly
as
it
came,
the
feeling
passed.
A
pleasant
warmth
began
to
stream
through
his
body.
The
initiate
exhaled,
smiling
inwardly
as
he
gazed
up
at
the
unsuspecting
gray-eyed
man
who
had
foolishly
admitted
him
into
this
brotherhood's
most
secretive
ranks.
Soon
you
will
lose
everything
you
hold
most
dear.
The
Otis
elevator
climbing
the
south
pillar
of
the
Eiffel
Tower
was
overflowing
with
tourists.
Inside
the
cramped
lift,
an
austere
businessman
in
a
pressed
suit
gazed
down
at
the
boy
beside
him.
"You
look
pale,
son.
You
should
have
stayed
on
the
ground."
"I'm
okay"
the
boy
answered,
struggling
to
control
his
anxiety.
"I'll
get
out
on
the
next
level."
I
can't
breathe.
The
man
leaned
closer.
"I
thought
by
now
you
would
have
gotten
over
this."
He
brushed
the
child's
cheek
affectionately.
The
boy
felt
ashamed
to
disappoint
his
father,
but
he
could
barely
hear
through
the
ringing
in
his
ears.
/
can't
breathe.
I've
got
to
get
out
of
this
box!
The
elevator
operator
was
saying
something
reassuring
about
the
lift's
articulated
pistons
and
puddled-iron
construction.
Far
beneath
them,
the
streets
of
Paris
stretched
out
in
all
directions.
Almost
there,
the
boy
told
himself,
craning
his
neck
and
looking
up
at
the
unloading
platform.
Just
hold
on.
As
the
lift
angled
steeply
toward
the
upper
viewing
deck,
the
shaft
began
to
narrow,
its
massive
struts
contracting
into
a
tight,
vertical
tunnel.
"Dad,
I
don't
think"
Suddenly
a
staccato
crack
echoed
overhead.
The
carriage
jerked,
swaying
awkwardly
to
one
side.
Frayed
cables
began
whipping
around
the
carriage,
thrashing
like
snakes.
The
boy
reached
out
for
his
father.
"Dad!"
Their
eyes
locked
for
one
terrifying
second.
Then
the
bottom
dropped
out.
Robert
Langdon
jolted
upright
in
his
soft
leather
seat,
startling
out
of
the
semiconscious
daydream.
He
was
sitting
all
alone
in
the
enormous
cabin
of
a
Falcon
2000EX
corporate
jet
as
it
bounced
its
way
through
turbulence.
In
the
background,
the
dual
Pratt
&amp;
Whitney
engines
hummed
evenly.
"Mr.
Langdon?"
The
intercom
crackled
overhead.
"We're
on
final
approach."
Langdon
sat
up
straight
and
slid
his
lecture
notes
back
into
his
leather
daybag.
He'd
been
halfway
through
reviewing
Masonic
symbology
when
his
mind
had
drifted.
The
daydream
about
his
late
father,
Langdon
suspected,
had
been
stirred
by
this
morning's
unexpected
invitation
from
Langdon'
s
longtime
mentor,
Peter
Solomon.
The
other
man
I
never
want
to
disappoint.
The
fifty-eight-year-old
philanthropist,
historian,
and
scientist
had
taken
Langdon
under
his
wing
nearly
thirty
years
ago,
in
many
ways
filling
the
void
left
by
Langdon'
s
father's
death.
Despite
the
man's
influential
family
dynasty
and
massive
wealth,
Langdon
had
found
humility
and
warmth
in
Solomon's
soft
gray
eyes.
Outside
the
window
the
sun
had
set,
but
Langdon
could
still
make
out
the
slender
silhouette
of
the
world's
largest
obelisk,
rising
on
the
horizon
like
the
spire
of
an
ancient
gnomon.
The
555-foot
marble-faced
obelisk
marked
this
nation's
heart.
All
around
the
spire,
the
meticulous
geometry
of
streets
and
monuments
radiated
outward.
Even
from
the
air,
Washington,
D.C.,
exuded
an
almost
mystical
power.
Langdon
loved
this
city,
and
as
the
jet
touched
down,
he
felt
a
rising
excitement
about
what
lay
ahead.
The
jet
taxied
to
a
private
terminal
somewhere
in
the
vast
expanse
of
Dulles
International
Airport
and
came
to
a
stop.
Langdon
gathered
his
things,
thanked
the
pilots,
and
stepped
out
of
the
jet'
s
luxurious
interior
onto
the
foldout
staircase.
The
cold
January
air
felt
liberating.
Breathe,
Robert,
he
thought,
appreciating
the
wide-open
spaces.
A
blanket
of
white
fog
crept
across
the
runway,
and
Langdon
had
the
sensation
he
was
stepping
into
a
marsh
as
he
descended
onto
the
misty
tarmac.
"Hello!
Hello!"
a
singsong
British
voice
shouted
from
across
the
tarmac.
"Professor
Langdon?"
Langdon
looked
up
to
see
a
middle-aged
woman
with
a
badge
and
clipboard
hurrying
toward
him,
waving
happily
as
he
approached.
Curly
blond
hair
protruded
from
under
a
stylish
knit
wool
hat.
"Welcome
to
Washington,
sir!"
Langdon
smiled.
"Thank
you."
"My
name
is
Pam,
from
passenger
services."
The
woman
spoke
with
an
exuberance
that
was
almost
unsettling.
"If
you'll
come
with
me,
sir,
your
car
is
waiting."
Langdon
followed
her
across
the
runway
toward
the
Signature
terminal,
which
was
surrounded
by
glistening
private
jets.
A
taxi
stand
for
the
rich
and
famous.
"I
hate
to
embarrass
you,
Professor,"
the
woman
said,
sounding
sheepish,
"but
you
are
the
Robert
Langdon
who
writes
books
about
symbols
and
religion,
aren't
you?"
Langdon
hesitated
and
then
nodded.
"I
thought
so!"
she
said,
beaming.
"My
book
group
read
your
book
about
the
sacred
feminine
and
the
church!
What
a
delicious
scandal
that
one
caused!
You
do
enjoy
putting
the
fox
in
the
henhouse!"
Langdon
smiled.
"Scandal
wasn't
really
my
intention."
The
woman
seemed
to
sense
Langdon
was
not
in
the
mood
to
discuss
his
work.
"I'm
sorry.
Listen
to
me
rattling
on.
I
know
you
probably
get
tired
of
being
recoghttp://education.wolfram.com/summer/camp/nized
but
it's
your
own
fault."
She
playfully
motioned
to
his
clothing.
"Your
uniform
gave
you
away."
My
uniform?
Langdon
glanced
down
at
his
attire.
He
was
wearing
his
usual
charcoal
turtleneck,
Harris
Tweed
jacket,
khakis,
and
collegiate
cordovan
loafers
his
standard
attire
for
the
classroom,
lecture
circuit,
author
photos,
and
social
events.
The
woman
laughed.
"Those
turtlenecks
you
wear
are
so
dated.
You'd
look
much
sharper
in
a
tie!"
No
chance,
Langdon
thought.
Little
nooses.
Neckties
had
been
required
six
days
a
week
when
Langdon
attended
Phillips
Exeter
Academy,
and
despite
the
headmaster's
romantic
claims
that
the
origin
of
the
cravat
went
back
to
the
silk
fascalia
worn
by
Roman
orators
to
warm
their
vocal
cords,
Langdon
knew
that,
etymologically,
cravat
actually
derived
from
a
ruthless
band
of
"Croat"
mercenaries
who
donned
knotted
neckerchiefs
before
they
stormed
into
battle.
To
this
day,
this
ancient
battle
garb
was
donned
by
modern
office
warriors
hoping
to
intimidate
their
enemies
in
daily
boardroom
battles.
"Thanks
for
the
advice,"
Langdon
said
with
a
chuckle.
"I'll
consider
a
tie
in
the
future."
Mercifully,
a
professional-looking
man
in
a
dark
suit
got
out
of
a
sleek
Lincoln
Town
Car
parked
near
the
terminal
and
held
up
his
finger.
"Mr.
Langdon?
I'm
Charles
with
Beltway
Limousine."
He
opened
the
passenger
door.
"Good
evening,
sir.
Welcome
to
Washington."
Langdon
tipped
Pam
for
her
hospitality
and
then
climbed
into
the
plush
interior
of
the
Town
Car.
The
driver
showed
him
the
temperature
controls,
the
bottled
water,
and
the
basket
of
hot
muffins.
Seconds
later,
Langdon
was
speeding
away
on
a
private
access
road.
So
this
is
how
the
other
half
lives.
As
the
driver
gunned
the
car
up
Windsock
Drive,
he
consulted
his
passenger
manifest
and
placed
a
quick
call.
"This
is
Beltway
Limousine,"
the
driver
said
with
professional
efficiency.
"I
was
asked
to
confirm
once
my
passenger
had
landed."
He
paused.
"Yes,
sir.
Your
guest,
Mr.
Langdon,
has
arrived,
and
I
will
deliver
him
to
the
Capitol
Building
by
seven
P.M.
You're
welcome,
sir."
He
hung
up.
Langdon
had
to
smile.
No
stone
left
unturned.
Peter
Solomon's
attention
to
detail
was
one
of
his
most
potent
assets,
allowing
him
to
manage
his
substantial
power
with
apparent
ease.
A
few
billion
dollars
in
the
bank
doesn
't
hurt
either.
Langdon
settled
into
the
plush
leather
seat
and
closed
his
eyes
as
the
noise
of
the
airport
faded
behind
him.
The
U.S.
Capitol
was
a
half
hour
away,
and
he
appreciated
the
time
alone
to
gather
his
thoughts.
Everything
had
happened
so
quickly
today
that
Langdon
only
now
had
begun
to
think
in
earnest
about
the
incredible
evening
that
lay
ahead.
Arriving
under
a
veil
of
secrecy,
Langdon
thought,
amused
by
the
prospect.
Ten
miles
from
the
Capitol
Building,
a
lone
figure
was
eagerly
preparing
for
Robert
Langdon'
s
arrival.
The
one
who
called
himself
Mal'akh
pressed
the
tip
of
the
needle
against
his
shaved
head,
sighing
with
pleasure
as
the
sharp
tool
plunged
in
and
out
of
his
flesh.
The
soft
hum
of
the
electric
device
was
addictive
.
.
.
as
was
the
bite
of
the
needle
sliding
deep
into
his
dermis
and
depositing
its
dye.
/
am
a
masterpiece.
The
goal
of
tattooing
was
never
beauty.
The
goal
was
change.
From
the
scarified
Nubian
priests
of
2000
B.C.,
to
the
tattooed
acolytes
of
the
Cybele
cult
of
ancient
Rome,
to
the
moko
scars
of
the
modern
Maori,
humans
have
tattooed
themselves
as
a
way
of
offering
up
their
bodies
in
partial
sacrifice,
enduring
the
physical
pain
of
embellishment
and
emerging
changed
beings.
Despite
the
ominous
admonitions
of
Leviticus
19:28,
which
forbade
the
marking
of
one's
flesh,
tattoos
had
become
a
rite
of
passage
shared
by
millions
of
people
in
the
modern
age
everyone
from
clean-cut
teenagers
to
hard-core
drug
users
to
suburban
housewives.
The
act
of
tattooing
one's
skin
was
a
transformative
declaration
of
power,
an
announcement
to
the
world:
/
am
in
control
of
my
own
flesh.
The
intoxicating
feeling
of
control
derived
from
physical
transformation
had
addicted
millions
to
flesh-altering
practices
cosmetic
surgery,
body
piercing,
bodybuilding,
and
steroids
.
.
.
even
bulimia
and
transgendering.
The
human
spirit
craves
mastery
over
its
carnal
shell.
A
single
bell
chimed
on
Mal'akh's
grandfather
clock,
and
he
looked
up.
Six
thirty
P.M.
Leaving
his
tools,
he
wrapped
the
Kiryu
silk
robe
around
his
naked,
six-foot-three
body
and
strode
down
the
hall.
The
air
inside
this
sprawling
mansion
was
heavy
with
the
pungent
fragrance
of
his
skin
dyes
and
smoke
from
the
beeswax
candles
he
used
to
sterilize
his
needles.
The
towering
young
man
moved
down
the
corridor
past
priceless
Italian
antiques
a
Piranesi
etching,
a
Savonarola
chair,
a
silver
Bugarini
oil
lamp.
He
glanced
through
a
floor-to-ceiling
window
as
he
passed,
admiring
the
classical
skyline
in
the
distance.
The
luminous
dome
of
the
U.S.
Capitol
glowed
with
solemn
power
against
the
dark
winter
sky.
This
is
where
it
is
hidden,
he
thought.
It
is
buried
out
there
somewhere.
Few
men
knew
it
existed
and
even
fewer
knew
its
awesome
power
or
the
ingenious
way
in
which
it
had
been
hidden.
To
this
day,
it
remained
this
country's
greatest
untold
secret.
Those
few
who
did
know
the
truth
kept
it
hidden
behind
a
veil
of
symbols,
legends,
and
allegory.
Now
they
have
opened
their
doors
to
me,
Mal'akh
thought.
Three
weeks
ago,
in
a
dark
ritual
witnessed
by
America's
most
influential
men,
Mal'akh
had
ascended
to
the
thirty-third
degree,
the
highest
echelon
of
the
world's
oldest
surviving
brotherhood.
Despite
Mal'akh's
new
rank,
the
brethren
had
told
him
nothing.
Nor
will
they,
he
knew.
That
was
not
how
it
worked.
There
were
circles
within
circles
brotherhoods
within
brotherhoods.
Even
if
Mal'akh
waited
years,
he
might
never
earn
their
ultimate
trust.
Fortunately,
he
did
not
need
their
trust
to
obtain
their
deepest
secret.
My
initiation
served
its
purpose.
Now,
energized
by
what
lay
ahead,
he
strode
toward
his
bedroom.
Throughout
his
entire
home,
audio
speakers
broadcast
the
eerie
strains
of
a
rare
recording
of
a
castrato
singing
the
"Lux
Aeterna"
from
the
Verdi
Requiem
a
reminder
of
a
previous
life.
Mal'akh
touched
a
remote
control
to
bring
on
the
thundering
"Dies
Irae."
Then,
against
a
backdrop
of
crashing
timpani
and
parallel
fifths,
he
bounded
up
the
marble
staircase,
his
robe
billowing
as
he
ascended
on
sinewy
legs.
As
he
ran,
his
empty
stomach
growled
in
protest.
For
two
days
now,
Mal'akh
had
fasted,
consuming
only
water,
preparing
his
body
in
accordance
with
the
ancient
ways.
Your
hunger
will
be
satisfied
by
dawn,
he
reminded
himself.
Along
with
your
pain.
Mal'akh
entered
his
bedroom
sanctuary
with
reverence,
locking
the
door
behind
him.
As
he
moved
toward
his
dressing
area,
he
paused,
feeling
himself
drawn
to
the
enormous
gilded
mirror.
Unable
to
resist,
he
turned
and
faced
his
own
reflection.
Slowly,
as
if
unwrapping
a
priceless
gift,
Mal'akh
opened
his
robe
to
unveil
his
naked
form.
The
vision
awed
him.
/
am
a
masterpiece.
His
massive
body
was
shaved
and
smooth.
He
lowered
his
gaze
first
to
his
feet,
which
were
tattooed
with
the
scales
and
talons
of
a
hawk.
Above
that,
his
muscular
legs
were
tattooed
as
carved
pillars
his
left
leg
spiraled
and
his
right
vertically
striated.
Boaz
and
Jachin.
His
groin
and
abdomen
formed
a
decorated
archway,
above
which
his
powerful
chest
was
emblazoned
with
the
double-headed
phoenix
each
head
in
profile
with
its
visible
eye
formed
by
one
of
Mal'akh's
nipples.
His
shoulders,
neck,
face,
and
shaved
head
were
completely
covered
with
an
intricate
tapestry
of
ancient
symbols
and
sigils.
/
am
an
artifact
an
evolving
icon.
One
mortal
man
had
seen
Mal'akh
naked,
eighteen
hours
earlier.
The
man
had
shouted
in
fear.
"Good
God,
you're
a
demon!"
"If
you
perceive
me
as
such,"
Mal'akh
had
replied,
understanding
as
had
the
ancients
that
angels
and
demons
were
identical
interchangeable
archetypes
all
a
matter
of
polarity:
the
guardian
angel
who
conquered
your
enemy
in
battle
was
perceived
by
your
enemy
as
a
demon
destroyer.
Mal'akh
tipped
his
face
down
now
and
got
an
oblique
view
of
the
top
of
his
head.
There,
within
the
crownlike
halo,
shone
a
small
circle
of
pale,
untattooed
flesh.
This
carefully
guarded
canvas
was
Mal'akh's
only
remaining
piece
of
virgin
skin.
The
sacred
space
had
waited
patiently
and
tonight,
it
would
be
filled.
Although
Mal'akh
did
not
yet
possess
what
he
required
to
complete
his
masterpiece,
he
knew
the
moment
was
fast
approaching.
Exhilarated
by
his
reflection,
he
could
already
feel
his
power
growing.
He
closed
his
robe
and
walked
to
the
window,
again
gazing
out
at
the
mystical
city
before
him.
It
is
buried
out
there
somewhere.
Refocusing
on
the
task
at
hand,
Mal'akh
went
to
his
dressing
table
and
carefully
applied
a
base
of
concealer
makeup
to
his
face,
scalp,
and
neck
until
his
tattoos
had
disappeared.
Then
he
donned
the
special
set
of
clothing
and
other
items
he
had
meticulously
prepared
for
this
evening.
When
he
finished,
he
checked
himself
in
the
mirror.
Satisfied,
he
ran
a
soft
palm
across
his
smooth
scalp
and
smiled.
It
is
out
there,
he
thought.
And
tonight,
one
man
will
help
me
find
it.
As
Mal'akh
exited
his
home,
he
prepared
himself
for
the
event
that
would
soon
shake
the
U.S.
Capitol
Building.
He
had
gone
to
enormous
lengths
to
arrange
all
the
pieces
for
tonight.
And
now,
at
last,
his
final
pawn
had
entered
the
game.
Robert
Langdon
was
busy
reviewing
his
note
cards
when
the
hum
of
the
Town
Car's
tires
changed
pitch
on
the
road
beneath
him.
Langdon
glanced
up,
surprised
to
see
where
they
were.
Memorial
Bridge
already?
He
put
down
his
notes
and
gazed
out
at
the
calm
waters
of
the
Potomac
passing
beneath
him.
A
heavy
mist
hovered
on
the
surface.
Aptly
named,
Foggy
Bottom
had
always
seemed
a
peculiar
site
on
which
to
build
the
nation's
capital.
Of
all
the
places
in
the
New
World,
the
forefathers
had
chosen
a
soggy
riverside
marsh
on
which
to
lay
the
cornerstone
of
their
Utopian
society.
Langdon
gazed
left,
across
the
Tidal
Basin,
toward
the
gracefully
rounded
silhouette
of
the
Jefferson
Memorial
America's
Pantheon,
as
many
called
it.
Directly
in
front
of
the
car,
the
Lincoln
Memorial
rose
with
rigid
austerity,
its
orthogonal
lines
reminiscent
of
Athens's
ancient
Parthenon.
But
it
was
farther
away
that
Langdon
saw
the
city's
centerpiece
the
same
spire
he
had
seen
from
the
air.
Its
architectural
inspiration
was
far,
far
older
than
the
Romans
or
the
Greeks.
America
's
Egyptian
obelisk.
The
monolithic
spire
of
the
Washington
Monument
loomed
dead
ahead,
illuminated
against
the
sky
like
the
majestic
mast
of
a
ship.
From
Langdon'
s
oblique
angle,
the
obelisk
appeared
ungrounded
tonight
swaying
against
the
dreary
sky
as
if
on
an
unsteady
sea.
Langdon
felt
similarly
ungrounded.
His
visit
to
Washington
had
been
utterly
unexpected.
/
woke
up
this
morning
anticipating
a
quiet
Sunday
at
home
and
now
I'm
a
few
minutes
away
from
the
U.S.
Capitol.
This
morning
at
four
forty-five,
Langdon
had
plunged
into
dead-calm
water,
beginning
his
day
as
he
always
did,
swimming
fifty
laps
in
the
deserted
Harvard
Pool.
His
physique
was
not
quite
what
it
had
been
in
his
college
days
as
a
water-polo
all-
American,
but
he
was
still
lean
and
toned,
respectable
for
a
man
in
his
forties.
The
only
difference
now
was
the
amount
of
effort
it
took
Langdon
to
keep
it
that
way.
When
Langdon
arrived
home
around
six,
he
began
his
morning
ritual
of
hand-grinding
Sumatra
coffee
beans
and
savoring
the
exotic
scent
that
filled
his
kitchen.
This
morning,
however,
he
was
surprised
to
see
the
blinking
red
light
on
his
voice-mail
display.
Who
calls
at
six
A.M.
on
a
Sunday?
He
pressed
the
button
and
listened
to
the
message.
"Good
morning,
Professor
Langdon,
I'm
terribly
sorry
for
this
early-morning
call."
The
polite
voice
was
noticeably
hesitant,
with
a
hint
of
a
southern
accent.
"My
name
is
Anthony
Jelbart,
and
I'm
Peter
Solomon's
executive
assistant.
Mr.
Solomon
told
me
you're
an
early
riser
he
has
been
trying
to
reach
you
this
morning
on
short
notice.
As
soon
as
you
receive
this
message,
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
call
Peter
directly?
You
probably
have
his
new
private
line,
but
if
not,
it's
202-329-5746."
Langdon
felt
a
sudden
concern
for
his
old
friend.
Peter
Solomon
was
impeccably
well-bred
and
courteous,
and
certainly
not
the
kind
of
man
to
call
at
daybreak
on
a
Sunday
unless
something
was
very
wrong.
Langdon
left
his
coffee
half
made
and
hurried
toward
his
study
to
return
the
call.
/
hope
he
's
okay.
Peter
Solomon
had
been
a
friend,
mentor,
and,
although
only
twelve
years
Langdon'
s
senior,
a
father
figure
to
him
ever
since
their
first
meeting
at
Princeton
University.
As
a
sophomore,
Langdon
had
been
required
to
attend
an
evening
guest
lecture
by
the
well-known
young
historian
and
philanthropist.
Solomon
had
spoken
with
a
contagious
passion,
presenting
a
dazzling
vision
of
semiotics
and
archetypal
history
that
had
sparked
in
Langdon
what
would
later
become
his
lifelong
passion
for
symbols.
It
was
not
Peter
Solomon's
brilliance,
however,
but
the
humility
in
his
gentle
gray
eyes
that
had
given
Langdon
the
courage
to
write
him
a
thank-
you
letter.
The
young
sophomore
had
never
dreamed
that
Peter
Solomon,
one
of
America's
wealthiest
and
most
intriguing
young
intellectuals,
would
ever
write
back.
But
Solomon
did.
And
it
had
been
the
beginning
of
a
truly
gratifying
friendship.
A
prominent
academic
whose
quiet
manner
belied
his
powerful
heritage,
Peter
Solomon
came
from
the
ultrawealthy
Solomon
family,
whose
names
appeared
on
buildings
and
universities
all
over
the
nation.
Like
the
Rothschilds
in
Europe,
the
surname
Solomon
had
always
carried
the
mystique
of
American
royalty
and
success.
Peter
had
inherited
the
mantle
at
a
young
age
after
the
death
of
his
father,
and
now,
at
fifty-eight,
he
had
held
numerous
positions
of
power
in
his
life.
He
currently
served
as
the
head
of
the
Smithsonian
Institution.
Langdon
occasionally
ribbed
Peter
that
the
lone
tarnish
on
his
sterling
pedigree
was
his
diploma
from
a
second-rate
university
Yale.
Now,
as
Langdon
entered
his
study,
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
he
had
received
a
fax
from
Peter
as
well.
Peter
Solomon
OFFICE
OF
THE
SECRETARY
THE
SMITHSONIAN
INSTITUTION
Good
morning,
Robert,
I
need
to
speak
with
you
at
once.
Please
call
me
this
morning
as
soon
as
you
can
at
202-329-5746.
Peter
Langdon
immediately
dialed
the
number,
sitting
down
at
his
hand-carved
oak
desk
to
wait
as
the
call
went
through.
"Office
of
Peter
Solomon,"
the
familiar
voice
of
the
assistant
answered.
"This
is
Anthony.
May
I
help
you?"
"Hello,
this
is
Robert
Langdon.
You
left
me
a
message
earlier
"Yes,
Professor
Langdon!"
The
young
man
sounded
relieved.
"Thank
you
for
calling
back
so
quickly.
Mr.
Solomon
is
eager
to
speak
to
you.
Let
me
tell
him
you're
on
the
line.
May
I
put
you
on
hold?"
"Of
course."
As
Langdon
waited
for
Solomon
to
get
on
the
line,
he
gazed
down
at
Peter's
name
atop
the
Smithsonian
letterhead
and
had
to
smile.
Not
many
slackers
in
the
Solomon
clan.
Peter'
s
ancestral
tree
burgeoned
with
the
names
of
wealthy
business
magnates,
influential
politicians,
and
a
number
of
distinguished
scientists,
some
even
fellows
of
London's
Royal
Society.
Solomon's
only
living
family
member,
his
younger
sister,
Katherine,
had
apparently
inherited
the
science
gene,
because
she
was
now
a
leading
figure
in
a
new
cutting-
edge
discipline
called
Noetic
Science.
All
Greek
to
me,
Langdon
thought,
amused
to
recall
Katherine'
s
unsuccessful
attempt
to
explain
Noetic
Science
to
him
at
a
party
at
her
brother's
home
last
year.
Langdon
had
listened
carefully
and
then
replied,
"Sounds
more
like
magic
than
science."
Katherine
winked
playfully.
"They're
closer
than
you
think,
Robert."
Now
Solomon's
assistant
returned
to
the
phone.
"I'm
sorry,
Mr.
Solomon
is
trying
to
get
off
a
conference
call.
Things
are
a
little
chaotic
here
this
morning."
"That's
not
a
problem.
I
can
easily
call
back."
"Actually,
he
asked
me
to
fill
you
in
on
his
reason
for
contacting
you,
if
you
don't
mind?"
"Of
course
not."
The
assistant
inhaled
deeply.
"As
you
probably
know,
Professor,
every
year
here
in
Washington,
the
board
of
the
Smithsonian
hosts
a
private
gala
to
thank
our
most
generous
supporters.
Many
of
the
country's
cultural
elite
attend."
Langdon
knew
his
own
bank
account
had
too
few
zeros
to
qualify
him
as
culturally
elite,
but
he
wondered
if
maybe
Solomon
was
going
to
invite
him
to
attend
nonetheless.
"This
year,
as
is
customary,"
the
assistant
continued,
"the
dinner
will
be
preceded
by
a
keynote
address.
We've
been
lucky
enough
to
secure
the
National
Statuary
Hall
for
that
speech."
The
best
room
in
all
ofD.C,
Langdon
thought,
recalling
a
political
lecture
he
had
once
attended
in
the
dramatic
semicircular
hall.
It
was
hard
to
forget
five
hundred
folding
chairs
splayed
in
a
perfect
arc,
surrounded
by
thirty
-eight
life-size
statues,
in
a
room
that
had
once
served
as
the
nation's
original
House
of
Representatives
chamber.
"The
problem
is
this,"
the
man
said.
"Our
speaker
has
fallen
ill
and
has
just
informed
us
she
will
be
unable
to
give
the
address."
He
paused
awkwardly.
"This
means
we
are
desperate
for
a
replacement
speaker.
And
Mr.
Solomon
is
hoping
you
would
consider
filling
in."
Langdon
did
a
double
take.
"Me?"
This
was
not
at
all
what
he
had
expected.
"I'm
sure
Peter
could
find
a
far
better
substitute."
"You're
Mr.
Solomon's
first
choice,
Professor,
and
you're
being
much
too
modest.
The
institution's
guests
would
be
thrilled
to
hear
from
you,
and
Mr.
Solomon
thought
you
could
give
the
same
lecture
you
gave
on
Bookspan
TV
a
few
years
back?
That
way,
you
wouldn't
have
to
prepare
a
thing.
He
said
your
talk
involved
symbolism
in
the
architecture
of
our
nation's
capital
it
sounds
absolutely
perfect
for
the
venue."
Langdon
was
not
so
sure.
"If
I
recall,
that
lecture
had
more
to
do
with
the
Masonic
history
of
the
building
than"
"Exactly!
As
you
know,
Mr.
Solomon
is
a
Mason,
as
are
many
of
his
professional
friends
who
will
be
in
attendance.
I'm
sure
they
would
love
to
hear
you
speak
on
the
topic."
/
admit
it
would
be
easy.
Langdon
had
kept
the
lecture
notes
from
every
talk
he'd
ever
given.
"I
suppose
I
could
consider
it.
What
date
is
the
event?"
The
assistant
cleared
his
throat,
sounding
suddenly
uncomfortable.
"Well,
actually,
sir,
it's
tonight."
Langdon
laughed
out
loud.
"Tonight?!"
"That's
why
it's
so
hectic
here
this
morning.
The
Smithsonian
is
in
a
deeply
embarrassing
predicament"
The
assistant
spoke
more
hurriedly
now.
"Mr.
Solomon
is
ready
to
send
a
private
jet
to
Boston
for
you.
The
flight
is
only
an
hour,
and
you
would
be
back
home
before
midnight.
You're
familiar
with
the
private
air
terminal
at
Boston's
Logan
Airport?"
"I
am,"
Langdon
admitted
reluctantly.
No
wonder
Peter
always
gets
his
way.
"Wonderful!
Would
you
be
willing
to
meet
the
jet
there
at
say
five
o'clock?"
"You
haven't
left
me
much
choice,
have
you?"
Langdon
chuckled.
"I
just
want
to
make
Mr.
Solomon
happy,
sir."
Peter
has
that
effect
on
people.
Langdon
considered
it
a
long
moment,
seeing
no
way
out.
"All
right.
Tell
him
I
can
do
it."
"Outstanding!"
the
assistant
exclaimed,
sounding
deeply
relieved.
He
gave
Langdon
the
jet's
tail
number
and
various
other
information.
When
Langdon
finally
hung
up,
he
wondered
if
Peter
Solomon
had
ever
been
told
no.
Returning
to
his
coffee
preparation,
Langdon
scooped
some
additional
beans
into
the
grinder.
A
little
extra
caffeine
this
morning,
he
thought.
It's
going
to
be
a
long
day.
The
U.S.
Capitol
Building
stands
regally
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
National
Mall,
on
a
raised
plateau
that
city
designer
Pierre
L'Enfant
described
as
"a
pedestal
waiting
for
a
monument."
The
Capitol's
massive
footprint
measures
more
than
750
feet
in
length
and
350
feet
deep.
Housing
more
than
sixteen
acres
of
floor
space,
it
contains
an
astonishing
541
rooms.
The
neoclassical
architecture
is
meticulously
designed
to
echo
the
grandeur
of
ancient
Rome,
whose
ideals
were
the
inspiration
for
America's
founders
in
establishing
the
laws
and
culture
of
the
new
republic.
The
new
security
checkpoint
for
tourists
entering
the
Capitol
Building
is
located
deep
within
the
recently
completed
subterranean
visitor
center,
beneath
a
magnificent
glass
skylight
that
frames
the
Capitol
Dome.
Newly
hired
security
guard
Alfonso
Nunez
carefully
studied
the
male
visitor
now
approaching
his
checkpoint.
The
man
had
a
shaved
head
and
had
been
lingering
in
the
lobby,
completing
a
phone
call
before
entering
the
building.
His
right
arm
was
in
a
sling,
and
he
moved
with
a
slight
limp.
He
was
wearing
a
tattered
army-navy
surplus
coat,
which,
combined
with
his
shaved
head,
made
Nunez
guess
military.
Those
who
had
served
in
the
U.S.
armed
forces
were
among
the
most
common
visitors
to
Washington.
"Good
evening,
sir,"
Nunez
said,
following
the
security
protocol
of
verbally
engaging
any
male
visitor
who
entered
alone.
"Hello,"
the
visitor
said,
glancing
around
at
the
nearly
deserted
entry.
"Quiet
night."
"NFC
play-offs,"
Nunez
replied.
"Everyone's
watching
the
Redskins
tonight."
Nunez
wished
he
were,
too,
but
this
was
his
first
month
on
the
job,
and
he'd
drawn
the
short
straw.
"Metal
objects
in
the
dish,
please."
As
the
visitor
fumbled
to
empty
the
pockets
of
his
long
coat
with
his
one
working
hand,
Nunez
watched
him
carefully.
Human
instinct
made
special
allowances
for
the
injured
and
handicapped,
but
it
was
an
instinct
Nunez
had
been
trained
to
override.
Nunez
waited
while
the
visitor
removed
from
his
pockets
the
usual
assortment
of
loose
change,
keys,
and
a
couple
of
cell
phones.
"Sprain?"
Nunez
asked,
eyeing
the
man's
injured
hand,
which
appeared
to
be
wrapped
in
a
series
of
thick
Ace
bandages.
The
bald
man
nodded.
"Slipped
on
the
ice.
A
week
ago.
Still
hurts
like
hell."
"Sorry
to
hear
that.
Walk
through,
please."
The
visitor
limped
through
the
detector,
and
the
machine
buzzed
in
protest.
The
visitor
frowned.
"I
was
afraid
of
that.
I'm
wearing
a
ring
under
these
bandages.
My
finger
was
too
swollen
to
get
it
off,
so
the
doctors
wrapped
right
over
it."
"No
problem,"
Nunez
said.
"I'll
use
the
wand."
Nunez
ran
the
metal-detection
wand
over
the
visitor's
wrapped
hand.
As
expected,
the
only
metal
he
detected
was
a
large
lump
on
the
man's
injured
ring
finger.
Nunez
took
his
time
rubbing
the
metal
detector
over
every
inch
of
the
man's
sling
and
finger.
He
knew
his
supervisor
was
probably
monitoring
him
on
the
closed
circuit
in
the
building's
security
center,
and
Nunez
needed
this
job.
Always
better
to
be
cautious.
He
carefully
slid
the
wand
up
inside
the
man's
sling.
The
visitor
winced
in
pain.
"Sorry."
"It's
okay,"
the
man
said.
"You
can't
be
too
careful
these
days."
"Ain't
that
the
truth."
Nunez
liked
this
guy.
Strangely,
that
counted
for
a
lot
around
here.
Human
instinct
was
America's
first
line
of
defense
against
terrorism.
It
was
a
proven
fact
that
human
intuition
was
a
more
accurate
detector
of
danger
than
all
the
electronic
gear
in
the
world
the
gift
of
fear,
as
one
of
their
security
reference
books
termed
it.
In
this
case,
Nunez's
instincts
sensed
nothing
that
caused
him
any
fear.
The
only
oddity
that
he
noticed,
now
that
they
were
standing
so
close,
was
that
this
tough-looking
guy
appeared
to
have
used
some
kind
of
self-
tanner
or
concealer
makeup
on
his
face.
Whatever.
Everyone
hates
to
be
pale
in
the
winter.
"You're
fine,"
Nunez
said,
completing
his
sweep
and
stowing
the
wand.
"Thanks."
The
man
started
collecting
his
belongings
from
the
tray.
As
he
did,
Nunez
noticed
that
the
two
fingers
protruding
from
his
bandage
each
bore
a
tattoo;
the
tip
of
his
index
finger
bore
the
image
of
a
crown,
and
the
tip
of
his
thumb
bore
that
of
a
star.
Seems
everyone
has
tattoos
these
days,
Nunez
thought,
although
the
pads
of
his
fingertips
seemed
like
painful
spots
to
get
them.
"Those
tats
hurt?"
The
man
glanced
down
at
his
fingertips
and
chuckled.
"Less
than
you
might
think."
"Lucky,"
Nunez
said.
"Mine
hurt
a
lot.
I
got
a
mermaid
on
my
back
when
I
was
in
boot
camp."
"A
mermaid?"
The
bald
man
chuckled.
"Yeah,"
he
said,
feeling
sheepish.
"The
mistakes
we
make
in
our
youth."
"I
hear
you,"
the
bald
man
said.
"I
made
a
big
mistake
in
my
youth,
too.
Now
I
wake
up
with
her
every
morning."
They
both
laughed
as
the
man
headed
off.
Child's
play,
Mal'akh
thought
as
he
moved
past
Nunez
and
up
the
escalator
toward
the
Capitol
Building.
The
entry
had
been
easier
than
anticipated.
Mal'akh's
slouching
posture
and
padded
belly
had
hidden
his
true
physique,
while
the
makeup
on
his
face
and
hands
had
hidden
the
tattoos
that
covered
his
body.
The
true
genius,
however,
was
the
sling,
which
disguised
the
potent
object
Mal'akh
was
transporting
into
the
building.
A
gift
for
the
one
man
on
earth
who
can
help
me
obtain
what
I
seek.
The
world's
largest
and
most
technologically
advanced
museum
is
also
one
of
the
world's
best-kept
secrets.
It
houses
more
pieces
than
the
Hermitage,
the
Vatican
Museum,
and
the
New
York
Metropolitan
combined.
Yet
despite
its
magnificent
collection,
few
members
of
the
public
are
ever
invited
inside
its
heavily
guarded
walls.
Located
at
4210
Silver
Hill
Road
just
outside
of
Washington,
D.C.,
the
museum
is
a
massive
zigzag-shaped
edifice
constructed
of
five
interconnected
pods
each
pod
larger
than
a
football
field.
The
building's
bluish
metal
exterior
barely
hints
at
the
strangeness
within
a
six-hundred-thousand-square-foot
alien
world
that
contains
a
"dead
zone,"
a
"wet
pod,"
and
more
than
twelve
miles
of
storage
cabinets.
Tonight,
scientist
Katherine
Solomon
was
feeling
unsettled
as
she
drove
her
white
Volvo
up
to
the
building's
main
security
gate.
The
guard
smiled.
"Not
a
football
fan,
Ms.
Solomon?"
He
lowered
the
volume
on
the
Redskins
play-off
pregame
show.
Katherine
forced
a
tense
smile.
"It's
Sunday
night."
"Oh,
that's
right.
Your
meeting."
"Is
he
here
yet?"
she
asked
anxiously.
He
glanced
down
at
his
paperwork.
"I
don't
see
him
on
the
log."
"I'm
early."
Katherine
gave
a
friendly
wave
and
continued
up
the
winding
access
road
to
her
usual
parking
spot
at
the
bottom
of
the
small,
two-tiered
lot.
She
began
collecting
her
things
and
gave
herself
a
quick
check
in
the
rearview
mirror
more
out
of
force
of
habit
than
actual
vanity.
Katherine
Solomon
had
been
blessed
with
the
resilient
Mediterranean
skin
of
her
ancestry,
and
even
at
fifty
years
old
she
had
a
smooth
olive
complexion.
She
used
almost
no
makeup
and
wore
her
thick
black
hair
unstyled
and
down.
Like
her
older
brother,
Peter,
she
had
gray
eyes
and
a
slender,
patrician
elegance.
You
two
might
as
well
be
twins,
people
often
told
them.
Their
father
had
succumbed
to
cancer
when
Katherine
was
only
seven,
and
she
had
little
memory
of
him.
Her
brother,
eight
years
Katherine'
s
senior
and
only
fifteen
when
their
father
died,
had
begun
his
journey
toward
becoming
the
Solomon
patriarch
much
sooner
than
anyone
had
ever
dreamed.
As
expected,
though,
Peter
had
grown
into
the
role
with
the
dignity
and
strength
befitting
their
family
name.
To
this
day,
he
still
watched
over
Katherine
as
though
they
were
just
kids.
Despite
her
brother's
occasional
prodding,
and
no
shortage
of
suitors,
Katherine
had
never
married.
Science
had
become
her
life
partner,
and
her
work
had
proven
more
fulfilling
and
exciting
than
any
man
could
ever
hope
to
be.
Katherine
had
no
regrets.
Her
field
of
choice
Noetic
Science
had
been
virtually
unknown
when
she
first
heard
of
it,
but
in
recent
years
it
had
started
opening
new
doors
of
understanding
into
the
power
of
the
human
mind.
Our
untapped
potential
is
truly
shocking.
Katherine'
s
two
books
on
Noetics
had
established
her
as
a
leader
in
this
obscure
field,
but
her
most
recent
discoveries,
when
published,
promised
to
make
Noetic
Science
a
topic
of
mainstream
conversation
around
the
world.
Tonight,
however,
science
was
the
last
thing
on
her
mind.
Earlier
in
the
day,
she
had
received
some
truly
upsetting
information
relating
to
her
brother.
/
still
can't
believe
it's
true.
She'd
thought
of
nothing
else
all
afternoon.
A
pattering
of
light
rain
drummed
on
her
windshield,
and
Katherine
quickly
gathered
her
things
to
get
inside.
She
was
about
to
step
out
of
her
car
when
her
cell
phone
rang.
She
checked
the
caller
ID
and
inhaled
deeply.
Then
she
tucked
her
hair
behind
her
ears
and
settled
in
to
take
the
call.
Six
miles
away,
Mal'akh
was
moving
through
the
corridors
of
the
U.S.
Capitol
Building
with
a
cell
phone
pressed
to
his
ear.
He
waited
patiently
as
the
line
rang.
Finally,
a
woman's
voice
answered.
"Yes?"
"We
need
to
meet
again,"
Mal'akh
said.
There
was
a
long
pause.
"Is
everything
all
right?"
"I
have
new
information,"
Mal'akh
said.
"Tell
me."
Mal'akh
took
a
deep
breath.
"That
which
your
brother
believes
is
hidden
in
D.C.
?"
"Yes?"
"It
can
be
found."
Katherine
Solomon
sounded
stunned.
"You're
telling
me
it
is
realT
Mal'akh
smiled
to
himself.
"Sometimes
a
legend
that
endures
for
centuries
endures
for
a
reason."
Is
this
as
close
as
you
can
get?"
Robert
Langdon
felt
a
sudden
wave
of
anxiety
as
his
driver
parked
on
First
Street,
a
good
quarter
mile
from
the
Capitol
Building.
"Afraid
so,"
the
driver
said.
"Homeland
Security.
No
vehicles
near
landmark
buildings
anymore.
I'm
sorry,
sir."
Langdon
checked
his
watch,
startled
to
see
it
was
already
6:50.
A
construction
zone
around
the
National
Mall
had
slowed
them
down,
and
his
lecture
was
to
begin
in
ten
minutes.
"Weather's
turning,"
the
driver
said,
hopping
out
and
opening
Langdon'
s
door
for
him.
"You'll
want
to
hurry."
Langdon
reached
for
his
wallet
to
tip
the
driver,
but
the
man
waved
him
off.
"Your
host
already
added
a
very
generous
tip
to
the
charge."
Typical
Peter,
Langdon
thought,
gathering
his
things.
"Okay,
thanks
for
the
ride."
The
first
few
raindrops
began
to
fall
as
Langdon
reached
the
top
of
the
gracefully
arched
concourse
that
descended
to
the
new
"underground"
visitors'
entrance.
The
Capitol
Visitor
Center
had
been
a
costly
and
controversial
project.
Described
as
an
underground
city
to
rival
parts
of
Disney
World,
this
subterranean
space
reportedly
provided
over
a
half-million
square
feet
of
space
for
exhibits,
restaurants,
and
meeting
halls.
Langdon
had
been
looking
forward
to
seeing
it,
although
he
hadn't
anticipated
quite
this
long
a
walk.
The
skies
were
threatening
to
open
at
any
moment,
and
he
broke
into
a
jog,
his
loafers
offering
almost
no
traction
on
the
wet
cement.
/
dressed
for
a
lecture,
not
a
four-hundred-yard
downhill
dash
through
the
rain!
When
he
arrived
at
the
bottom,
he
was
breathless
and
panting.
Langdon
pushed
through
the
revolving
door,
taking
a
moment
in
the
foyer
to
catch
his
breath
and
brush
off
the
rain.
As
he
did,
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
newly
completed
space
before
him.
Okay,
I'm
impressed.
The
Capitol
Visitor
Center
was
not
at
all
what
he
had
expected.
Because
the
space
was
underground,
Langdon
had
been
apprehensive
about
passing
through
it.
A
childhood
accident
had
left
him
stranded
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
well
overnight,
and
Langdon
now
lived
with
an
almost
crippling
aversion
to
enclosed
spaces.
But
this
underground
space
was
airy
somehow.
Light.
Spacious.
The
ceiling
was
a
vast
expanse
of
glass
with
a
series
of
dramatic
light
fixtures
that
threw
a
muted
glow
across
the
pearl-colored
interior
finishes.
Normally,
Langdon
would
have
taken
a
full
hour
in
here
to
admire
the
architecture,
but
with
five
minutes
until
showtime,
he
put
his
head
down
and
dashed
through
the
main
hall
toward
the
security
checkpoint
and
escalators.
Relax,
he
told
himself.
Peter
knows
you
're
on
your
way.
The
event
won
't
start
without
you.
At
the
security
point,
a
young
Hispanic
guard
chatted
with
him
while
Langdon
emptied
his
pockets
and
removed
his
vintage
watch.
"Mickey
Mouse?"
the
guard
said,
sounding
mildly
amused.
Langdon
nodded,
accustomed
to
the
comments.
The
collector's
edition
Mickey
Mouse
watch
had
been
a
gift
from
his
parents
on
his
ninth
birthday.
"I
wear
it
to
remind
me
to
slow
down
and
take
life
less
seriously."
"I
don't
think
it's
working,"
the
guard
said
with
a
smile.
"You
look
like
you're
in
a
serious
hurry."
Langdon
smiled
and
put
his
daybag
through
the
X-ray
machine.
"Which
way
to
the
Statuary
Hall?"
The
guard
motioned
toward
the
escalators.
"You'll
see
the
signs."
"Thanks."
Langdon
grabbed
his
bag
off
the
conveyor
and
hurried
on.
As
the
escalator
ascended,
Langdon
took
a
deep
breath
and
tried
to
gather
his
thoughts.
He
gazed
up
through
the
rain-speckled
glass
ceiling
at
the
mountainous
form
of
the
illuminated
Capitol
Dome
overhead.
It
was
an
astonishing
building.
High
atop
her
roof,
almost
three
hundred
feet
in
the
air,
the
Statue
of
Freedom
peered
out
into
the
misty
darkness
like
a
ghostly
sentinel.
Langdon
always
found
it
ironic
that
the
workers
who
hoisted
each
piece
of
the
nineteen-and-a-half-foot
bronze
statue
to
her
perch
were
slaves
a
Capitol
secret
that
seldom
made
the
syllabi
of
high
school
history
classes.
This
entire
building,
in
fact,
was
a
treasure
trove
of
bizarre
arcana
that
included
a
"killer
bathtub"
responsible
for
the
pneumonic
murder
of
Vice
President
Henry
Wilson,
a
staircase
with
a
permanent
bloodstain
over
which
an
inordinate
number
of
guests
seemed
to
trip,
and
a
sealed
basement
chamber
in
which
workers
in
1930
discovered
General
John
Alexander
Logan's
long-deceased
stuffed
horse.
No
legends
were
as
enduring,
however,
as
the
claims
of
thirteen
different
ghosts
that
haunted
this
building.
The
spirit
of
city
designer
Pierre
L'
Enfant
frequently
was
reported
wandering
the
halls,
seeking
payment
of
his
bill,
now
two
hundred
years
overdue.
The
ghost
of
a
worker
who
fell
from
the
Capitol
Dome
during
construction
was
seen
wandering
the
corridors
with
a
tray
of
tools.
And,
of
course,
the
most
famous
apparition
of
all,
reported
numerous
times
in
the
Capitol
basement
an
ephemeral
black
cat
that
prowled
the
substructure's
eerie
maze
of
narrow
passageways
and
cubicles.
Langdon
stepped
off
the
escalator
and
again
checked
his
watch.
Three
minutes.
He
hurried
down
the
wide
corridor,
following
the
signs
toward
the
Statuary
Hall
and
rehearsing
his
opening
remarks
in
his
head.
Langdon
had
to
admit
that
Peter's
assistant
had
been
correct;
this
lecture
topic
would
be
a
perfect
match
for
an
event
hosted
in
Washington,
D.C.,
by
a
prominent
Mason.
It
was
no
secret
that
D.C.
had
a
rich
Masonic
history.
The
cornerstone
of
this
very
building
had
been
laid
in
a
full
Masonic
ritual
by
George
Washington
himself.
This
city
had
been
conceived
and
designed
by
Master
Masons
George
Washington,
Ben
Franklin,
and
Pierre
L'
Enfant
powerful
minds
who
adorned
their
new
capital
with
Masonic
symbolism,
architecture,
and
art.
Of
course,
people
see
in
those
symbols
all
kinds
of
crazy
ideas.
Many
conspiracy
theorists
claimed
the
Masonic
forefathers
had
concealed
powerful
secrets
throughout
Washington
along
with
symbolic
messages
hidden
in
the
city's
layout
of
streets.
Langdon
never
paid
any
attention.
Misinformation
about
the
Masons
was
so
commonplace
that
even
educated
Harvard
students
seemed
to
have
surprisingly
warped
conceptions
about
the
brotherhood.
Last
year,
a
freshman
had
rushed
wild-eyed
into
Langdon'
s
classroom
with
a
printout
from
the
Web.
It
was
a
street
map
of
D.C.
on
which
certain
streets
had
been
highlighted
to
form
various
shapes
satanic
pentacles,
a
Masonic
compass
and
square,
the
head
of
Baphomet
proof
apparently
that
the
Masons
who
designed
Washington,
D.C,
were
involved
in
some
kind
of
dark,
mystical
conspiracy.
"Fun,"
Langdon
said,
"but
hardly
convincing.
If
you
draw
enough
intersecting
lines
on
a
map,
you're
bound
to
find
all
kinds
of
shapes."
"But
this
can't
be
coincidence!"
the
kid
exclaimed.
Langdon
patiently
showed
the
student
that
the
same
exact
shapes
could
be
formed
on
a
street
map
of
Detroit.
The
kid
seemed
sorely
disappointed.
"Don't
be
disheartened,"
Langdon
said.
"Washington
does
have
some
incredible
secrets
just
none
on
this
street
map."
The
young
man
perked
up.
"Secrets?
Like
what?"
"Every
spring
I
teach
a
course
called
Occult
Symbols.
I
talk
a
lot
about
D.C.
You
should
take
the
course."
"Occult
symbols!"
The
freshman
looked
excited
again.
"So
there
are
devil
symbols
in
D.C!"
Langdon
smiled.
"Sorry,
but
the
word
occult,
despite
conjuring
images
of
devil
worship,
actually
means
'hidden'
or
'obscured.'
In
times
of
religious
oppression,
knowledge
that
was
counterdoctrinal
had
to
be
kept
hidden
or
'occult,'
and
because
the
church
felt
threatened
by
this,
they
redefined
anything
'occult'
as
evil,
and
the
prejudice
survived."
"Oh."
The
kid
slumped.
Nonetheless,
that
spring,
Langdon
spotted
the
freshman
seated
in
the
front
row
as
five
hundred
students
bustled
into
Harvard's
Sanders
Theatre,
a
hollow
old
lecture
hall
with
creaking
wooden
benches.
"Good
morning,
everybody,"
Langdon
shouted
from
the
expansive
stage.
He
turned
on
a
slide
projector,
and
an
image
materialized
behind
him.
"As
you're
getting
settled,
how
many
of
you
recognize
the
building
in
this
picture?"
"U.S.
Capitol!"
dozens
of
voices
called
out
in
unison.
"Washington,
D.C!"
"Yes.
There
are
nine
million
pounds
of
ironwork
in
that
dome.
An
unparalleled
feat
of
architectural
ingenuity
for
the
1850s."
"Awesome!"
somebody
shouted.
Langdon
rolled
his
eyes,
wishing
somebody
would
ban
that
word.
"Okay,
and
how
many
of
you
have
ever
been
to
Washington?"
A
scattering
of
hands
went
up.
"So
few?"
Langdon
feigned
surprise.
"And
how
many
of
you
have
been
to
Rome,
Paris,
Madrid,
or
London?"
Almost
all
the
hands
in
the
room
went
up.
As
usual.
One
of
the
rites
of
passage
for
American
college
kids
was
a
summer
with
a
Eurorail
ticket
before
the
harsh
reality
of
real
life
set
in.
"It
appears
many
more
of
you
have
visited
Europe
than
have
visited
your
own
capital.
Why
do
you
think
that
is?"
"No
drinking
age
in
Europe!"
someone
in
back
shouted.
Langdon
smiled.
"As
if
the
drinking
age
here
stops
any
of
you?"
Everyone
laughed.
It
was
the
first
day
of
school,
and
the
students
were
taking
longer
than
usual
to
get
settled,
shifting
and
creaking
in
their
wooden
pews.
Langdon
loved
teaching
in
this
hall
because
he
always
knew
how
engaged
the
students
were
simply
by
listening
to
how
much
they
fidgeted
in
their
pews.
"Seriously,"
Langdon
said,
"Washington,
D.C.,
has
some
of
the
world's
finest
architecture,
art,
and
symbolism.
Why
would
you
go
overseas
before
visiting
your
own
capital?"
"Ancient
stuff
is
cooler,"
someone
said.
"And
by
ancient
stuff,"
Langdon
clarified,
"I
assume
you
mean
castles,
crypts,
temples,
that
sort
of
thing?"
Their
heads
nodded
in
unison.
"Okay.
Now,
what
if
I
told
you
that
Washington,
D.C.,
has
every
one
of
those
things?
Castles,
crypts,
pyramids,
temples
it's
all
there."
The
creaking
diminished.
"My
friends,"
Langdon
said,
lowering
his
voice
and
moving
to
the
front
of
the
stage,
"in
the
next
hour,
you
will
discover
that
our
nation
is
overflowing
with
secrets
and
hidden
history.
And
exactly
as
in
Europe,
all
of
the
best
secrets
are
hidden
in
plain
view."
The
wooden
pews
fell
dead
silent.
Gotcha.
Langdon
dimmed
the
lights
and
called
up
his
second
slide.
"Who
can
tell
me
what
George
Washington
is
doing
here?"
The
slide
was
a
famous
mural
depicting
George
Washington
dressed
in
full
Masonic
regalia
standing
before
an
odd-looking
contraption
a
giant
wooden
tripod
that
supported
a
rope-and-pulley
system
from
which
was
suspended
a
massive
block
of
stone.
A
group
of
well-dressed
onlookers
stood
around
him.
"Lifting
that
big
block
of
stone?"
someone
ventured.
Langdon
said
nothing,
preferring
that
a
student
make
the
correction
if
possible.
"Actually,"
another
student
offered,
"I
think
Washington
is
lowering
the
rock.
He's
wearing
a
Masonic
costume.
I've
seen
pictures
of
Masons
laying
cornerstones
before.
The
ceremony
always
uses
that
tripod
thing
to
lower
the
first
stone."
"Excellent,"
Langdon
said.
"The
mural
portrays
the
Father
of
Our
Country
using
a
tripod
and
pulley
to
lay
the
cornerstone
of
our
Capitol
Building
on
September
18,
1793,
between
the
hours
of
eleven
fifteen
and
twelve
thirty."
Langdon
paused,
scanning
the
class.
"Can
anyone
tell
me
the
significance
of
that
date
and
time?"
Silence.
"What
if
I
told
you
that
precise
moment
was
chosen
by
three
famous
Masons
George
Washington,
Benjamin
Franklin,
and
Pierre
L'Enfant,
the
primary
architect
for
D.C.?"
More
silence.
"Quite
simply,
the
cornerstone
was
set
at
that
date
and
time
because,
among
other
things,
the
auspicious
Caput
Draconis
was
in
Virgo."
Everyone
exchanged
odd
looks.
"Hold
on,"
someone
said.
"You
mean
like
astrology!"
"Exactly.
Although
a
different
astrology
than
we
know
today."
A
hand
went
up.
"You
mean
our
Founding
Fathers
believed
in
astrology?"
Langdon
grinned.
"Big-time.
What
would
you
say
if
I
told
you
the
city
of
Washington,
D.C.,
has
more
astrological
signs
in
its
architecture
than
any
other
city
in
the
world
zodiacs,
star
charts,
cornerstones
laid
at
precise
astrological
dates
and
times?
More
than
half
of
the
framers
of
our
Constitution
were
Masons,
men
who
strongly
believed
that
the
stars
and
fate
were
intertwined,
men
who
paid
close
attention
to
the
layout
of
the
heavens
as
they
structured
their
new
world."
"But
that
whole
thing
about
the
Capitol
cornerstone
being
laid
while
Caput
Draconis
was
in
Virgo
who
cares?
Can't
that
just
be
coincidence?"
"An
impressive
coincidence
considering
that
the
cornerstones
of
the
three
structures
that
make
up
Federal
Triangle
the
Capitol,
the
White
House,
the
Washington
Monument
were
all
laid
in
different
years
but
were
carefully
timed
to
occur
under
this
exact
same
astrological
condition."
Langdon'
s
gaze
was
met
by
a
room
full
of
wide
eyes.
A
number
of
heads
dipped
down
as
students
began
taking
notes.
A
hand
in
back
went
up.
"Why
did
they
do
that?"
Langdon
chuckled.
"The
answer
to
that
is
an
entire
semester's
worth
of
material.
If
you're
curious,
you
should
take
my
mysticism
course.
Frankly,
I
don't
think
you
guys
are
emotionally
prepared
to
hear
the
answer."
"What?"
the
person
shouted.
"Try
us!"
Langdon
made
a
show
of
considering
it
and
then
shook
his
head,
toying
with
them.
"Sorry,
I
can't
do
that.
Some
of
you
are
only
freshmen.
I'm
afraid
it
might
blow
your
minds."
"Tell
us!"
everyone
shouted.
Langdon
shrugged.
"Perhaps
you
should
join
the
Masons
or
Eastern
Star
and
learn
about
it
from
the
source."
"We
can't
get
in,"
a
young
man
argued.
"The
Masons
are
like
a
supersecret
society!"
"Supersecret?
Really?"
Langdon
remembered
the
large
Masonic
ring
that
his
friend
Peter
Solomon
wore
proudly
on
his
right
hand.
"Then
why
do
Masons
wear
obvious
Masonic
rings,
tie
clips,
or
pins?
Why
are
Masonic
buildings
clearly
marked?
Why
are
their
meeting
times
in
the
newspaper?"
Langdon
smiled
at
all
the
puzzled
faces.
"My
friends,
the
Masons
are
not
a
secret
society
they
are
a
society
with
secrets."
"Same
thing,"
someone
muttered.
"Is
it?"
Langdon
challenged.
"Would
you
consider
Coca-Cola
a
secret
society?"
"Of
course
not,"
the
student
said.
"Well,
what
if
you
knocked
on
the
door
of
corporate
headquarters
and
asked
for
the
recipe
for
Classic
Coke?"
"They'd
never
tell
you."
"Exactly.
In
order
to
learn
Coca-Cola's
deepest
secret,
you
would
need
to
join
the
company,
work
for
many
years,
prove
you
were
trustworthy,
and
eventually
rise
to
the
upper
echelons
of
the
company,
where
that
information
might
be
shared
with
you.
Then
you
would
be
sworn
to
secrecy."
"So
you're
saying
Freemasonry
is
like
a
corporation?"
"Only
insofar
as
they
have
a
strict
hierarchy
and
they
take
secrecy
very
seriously."
"My
uncle
is
a
Mason,"
a
young
woman
piped
up.
"And
my
aunt
hates
it
because
he
won't
talk
about
it
with
her.
She
says
Masonry
is
some
kind
of
strange
religion."
"A
common
misperception."
"It's
not
a
religion?"
"Give
it
the
litmus
test,"
Langdon
said.
"Who
here
has
taken
Professor
Witherspoon's
comparative
religion
course?"
Several
hands
went
up.
"Good.
So
tell
me,
what
are
the
three
prerequisites
for
an
ideology
to
be
considered
a
religion?"
"ABC,"
one
woman
offered.
"Assure,
Believe,
Convert."
"Correct,"
Langdon
said.
"Religions
assure
salvation;
religions
believe
in
a
precise
theology;
and
religions
convert
nonbelievers."
He
paused.
"Masonry,
however,
is
batting
zero
for
three.
Masons
make
no
promises
of
salvation;
they
have
no
specific
theology;
and
they
do
not
seek
to
convert
you.
In
fact,
within
Masonic
lodges,
discussions
of
religion
are
prohibited."
"So
Masonry
is
anti
religious?"
"On
the
contrary.
One
of
the
prerequisites
for
becoming
a
Mason
is
that
you
must
believe
in
a
higher
power.
The
difference
between
Masonic
spirituality
and
organized
religion
is
that
the
Masons
do
not
impose
a
specific
definition
or
name
on
a
higher
power.
Rather
than
definitive
theological
identities
like
God,
Allah,
Buddha,
or
Jesus,
the
Masons
use
more
general
terms
like
Supreme
Being
or
Great
Architect
of
the
Universe.
This
enables
Masons
of
different
faiths
to
gather
together."
"Sounds
a
little
far-out,"
someone
said.
"Or,
perhaps,
refreshingly
open-minded?"
Langdon
offered.
"In
this
age
when
different
cultures
are
killing
each
other
over
whose
definition
of
God
is
better,
one
could
say
the
Masonic
tradition
of
tolerance
and
open-
mindedness
is
commendable."
Langdon
paced
the
stage.
"Moreover,
Masonry
is
open
to
men
of
all
races,
colors,
and
creeds,
and
provides
a
spiritual
fraternity
that
does
not
discriminate
in
any
way."
"Doesn't
discriminate?"
A
member
of
the
university's
Women's
Center
stood
up.
"How
many
women
are
permitted
to
be
Masons,
Professor
Langdon?"
Langdon
showed
his
palms
in
surrender.
"A
fair
point.
Freemasonry
had
its
roots,
traditionally,
in
the
stone
masons'
guilds
of
Europe
and
was
therefore
a
man's
organization.
Several
hundred
years
ago,
some
say
as
early
as
1703,
a
women's
branch
called
Eastern
Star
was
founded.
They
have
more
than
a
million
members."
"Nonetheless,"
the
woman
said,
"Masonry
is
a
powerful
organization
from
which
women
are
excluded."
Langdon
was
not
sure
how
powerful
the
Masons
really
were
anymore,
and
he
was
not
going
to
go
down
that
road;
perceptions
of
the
modern
Masons
ranged
from
their
being
a
group
of
harmless
old
men
who
liked
to
play
dress-up
all
the
way
to
an
underground
cabal
of
power
brokers
who
ran
the
world.
The
truth,
no
doubt,
was
somewhere
in
the
middle.
"Professor
Langdon,"
called
a
young
man
with
curly
hair
in
the
back
row,
"if
Masonry
is
not
a
secret
society,
not
a
corporation,
and
not
a
religion,
then
what
is
it?"
"Well,
if
you
were
to
ask
a
Mason,
he
would
offer
the
following
definition:
Masonry
is
a
system
of
morality,
veiled
in
allegory
and
illustrated
by
symbols."
"Sounds
to
me
like
a
euphemism
for
'freaky
cult.'
"Freaky,
you
say?"
"Hell
yes!"
the
kid
said,
standing
up.
"I
heard
what
they
do
inside
those
secret
buildings!
Weird
candlelight
rituals
with
coffins,
and
nooses,
and
drinking
wine
out
of
skulls.
Now
that's
freaky!"
Langdon
scanned
the
class.
"Does
that
sound
freaky
to
anyone
else?"
"Yes!"
they
all
chimed
in.
Langdon
feigned
a
sad
sigh.
"Too
bad.
If
that's
too
freaky
for
you,
then
I
know
you'll
never
want
to
join
my
cult."
Silence
settled
over
the
room.
The
student
from
the
Women's
Center
looked
uneasy.
"You're
in
a
cult?"
Langdon
nodded
and
lowered
his
voice
to
a
conspiratorial
whisper.
"Don't
tell
anyone,
but
on
the
pagan
day
of
the
sun
god
Ra,
I
kneel
at
the
foot
of
an
ancient
instrument
of
torture
and
consume
ritualistic
symbols
of
blood
and
flesh."
The
class
looked
horrified.
Langdon
shrugged.
"And
if
any
of
you
care
to
join
me,
come
to
the
Harvard
chapel
on
Sunday,
kneel
beneath
the
crucifix,
and
take
Holy
Communion."
The
classroom
remained
silent.
Langdon
winked.
"Open
your
minds,
my
friends.
We
all
fear
what
we
do
not
understand."
The
tolling
of
a
clock
began
echoing
through
the
Capitol
corridors.
Seven
o
'clock.
Robert
Langdon
was
now
running.
Talk
about
a
dramatic
entrance.
Passing
through
the
House
Connecting
Corridor,
he
spotted
the
entrance
to
the
National
Statuary
Hall
and
headed
straight
for
it.
As
he
neared
the
door,
he
slowed
to
a
nonchalant
stroll
and
took
several
deep
breaths.
Buttoning
his
jacket,
he
lifted
his
chin
ever
so
slightly
and
turned
the
corner
just
as
the
final
chime
sounded.
Showtime.
As
Professor
Robert
Langdon
strode
into
the
National
Statuary
Hall,
he
raised
his
eyes
and
smiled
warmly.
An
instant
later,
his
smile
evaporated.
He
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks.
Something
was
very,
very
wrong.
Katherine
Solomon
hurried
across
the
parking
lot
through
the
cold
rain,
wishing
she
had
worn
more
than
jeans
and
a
cashmere
sweater.
As
she
neared
the
building's
main
entrance,
the
roar
of
the
giant
air
purifiers
got
louder.
She
barely
heard
them,
her
ears
still
ringing
from
the
phone
call
she'd
just
received.
That
which
your
brother
believes
is
hidden
in
D.C.
it
can
be
found.
Katherine
found
the
notion
almost
impossible
to
believe.
She
and
the
caller
still
had
much
to
discuss
and
had
agreed
to
do
so
later
that
evening.
Reaching
the
main
doors,
she
felt
the
same
sense
of
excitement
she
always
felt
upon
entering
the
gargantuan
building.
Nobody
knows
this
place
is
here.
The
sign
on
the
door
announced:
SMITHSONIAN
MUSEUM
SUPPORT
CENTER
(SMSC)
The
Smithsonian
Institution,
despite
having
more
than
a
dozen
massive
museums
on
the
National
Mall,
had
a
collection
so
huge
that
only
2
percent
of
it
could
be
on
display
at
any
one
time.
The
other
98
percent
of
the
collection
had
to
be
stored
somewhere.
And
that
somewhere
was
here.
Not
surprisingly,
this
building
was
home
to
an
astonishingly
diverse
array
of
artifacts
giant
Buddhas,
handwritten
codices,
poisoned
darts
from
New
Guinea,
jewel-encrusted
knives,
a
kayak
made
of
baleen.
Equally
mind-boggling
were
the
building's
natural
treasures
plesiosaur
skeletons,
a
priceless
meteorite
collection,
a
giant
squid,
even
a
collection
of
elephant
skulls
brought
back
from
an
African
safari
by
Teddy
Roosevelt.
But
none
of
this
was
why
the
Smithsonian
secretary,
Peter
Solomon,
had
introduced
his
sister
to
the
SMSC
three
years
ago.
He
had
brought
her
to
this
place
not
to
behold
scientific
marvels,
but
rather
to
create
them.
And
that
was
exactly
what
Katherine
had
been
doing.
Deep
within
this
building,
in
the
darkness
of
the
most
remote
recesses,
was
a
small
scientific
laboratory
unlike
any
other
in
the
world.
The
recent
breakthroughs
Katherine
had
made
here
in
the
field
of
Noetic
Science
had
ramifications
across
every
discipline
from
physics,
to
history,
to
philosophy,
to
religion.
Soon
everything
will
change,
she
thought.
As
Katherine
entered
the
lobby,
the
front
desk
guard
quickly
stashed
his
radio
and
yanked
the
earplugs
from
his
ears.
"Ms.
Solomon!"
He
smiled
broadly.
"Redskins?"
He
blushed,
looking
guilty.
"Pregame."
She
smiled.
"I
won't
tell."
She
walked
to
the
metal
detector
and
emptied
her
pockets.
When
she
slid
the
gold
Cartier
watch
from
her
wrist,
she
felt
the
usual
pang
of
sadness.
The
timepiece
had
been
a
gift
from
her
mother
for
Katherine's
eighteenth
birthday.
Almost
ten
years
had
now
passed
since
her
mother
had
died
violently
passing
away
in
Katherine's
arms.
"So,
Ms.
Solomon?"
the
guard
whispered
jokingly.
"Are
you
ever
gonna
tell
anybody
what
you're
doing
back
there?"
She
glanced
up.
"Someday,
Kyle.
Not
tonight."
"Come
on,"
he
pressed.
"A
secret
lab
in
a
secret
museum?
You
must
be
doing
something
cool."
Miles
beyond
cool,
Katherine
thought
as
she
collected
her
things.
The
truth
was
that
Katherine
was
doing
science
so
advanced
that
it
no
longer
even
resembled
science.
Robert
Langdon
stood
frozen
in
the
doorway
of
the
National
Statuary
Hall
and
studied
the
startling
scene
before
him.
The
room
was
precisely
as
he
remembered
it
a
balanced
semicircle
built
in
the
style
of
a
Greek
amphitheater.
The
graceful
arched
walls
of
sandstone
and
Italian
plaster
were
punctuated
by
columns
of
variegated
breccia,
interspersed
with
the
nation's
statuary
collection
life-size
statues
of
thirty-eight
great
Americans
standing
in
a
semicircle
on
a
stark
expanse
of
black-and-white
marble
tile.
It
was
exactly
as
Langdon
had
recalled
from
the
lecture
he
had
once
attended
here.
Except
for
one
thing.
Tonight,
the
room
was
empty.
No
chairs.
No
audience.
No
Peter
Solomon.
Just
a
handful
of
tourists
milling
around
aimlessly,
oblivious
to
Langdon'
s
grand
entrance.
Did
Peter
mean
the
Rotunda?
He
peered
down
the
south
corridor
toward
the
Rotunda
and
could
see
tourists
milling
around
in
there,
too.
The
echoes
of
the
clock
chime
had
faded.
Langdon
was
now
officially
late.
He
hurried
back
into
the
hallway
and
found
a
docent.
"Excuse
me,
the
lecture
for
the
Smithsonian
event
tonight?
Where
is
that
being
held?"
The
docent
hesitated.
"I'm
not
sure,
sir.
When
does
it
start?"
"Now!"
The
man
shook
his
head.
"I
don't
know
about
any
Smithsonian
event
this
evening
not
here,
at
least."
Bewildered,
Langdon
hurried
back
toward
the
center
of
the
room,
scanning
the
entire
space.
Is
Solomon
playing
some
kind
of
joke?
Langdon
couldn't
imagine
it.
He
pulled
out
his
cell
phone
and
the
fax
page
from
this
morning
and
dialed
Peter'
s
number.
His
phone
took
a
moment
to
locate
a
signal
inside
the
enormous
building.
Finally,
it
began
to
ring.
The
familiar
southern
accent
answered.
"Peter
Solomon's
office,
this
is
Anthony.
May
I
help
you?"
"Anthony!"
Langdon
said
with
relief.
"I'm
glad
you're
still
there.
This
is
Robert
Langdon.
There
seems
to
be
some
confusion
about
the
lecture.
I'm
standing
in
the
Statuary
Hall,
but
there's
nobody
here.
Has
the
lecture
been
moved
to
a
different
room?"
"I
don't
believe
so,
sir.
Let
me
check."
His
assistant
paused
a
moment.
"Did
you
confirm
with
Mr.
Solomon
directly?"
Langdon
was
confused.
"No,
I
confirmed
with
you,
Anthony.
This
morning!"
"Yes,
I
recall
that."
There
was
a
silence
on
the
line.
"That
was
a
bit
careless
of
you,
don't
you
think,
Professor?"
Langdon
was
now
fully
alert.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"Consider
this"
the
man
said.
"You
received
a
fax
asking
you
to
call
a
number,
which
you
did.
You
spoke
to
a
total
stranger
who
said
he
was
Peter
Solomon'
s
assistant.
Then
you
willingly
boarded
a
private
plane
to
Washington
and
climbed
into
a
waiting
car.
Is
that
right?"
Langdon
felt
a
chill
race
through
his
body.
"Who
the
hell
is
this?
Where
is
Peter?"
"I'm
afraid
Peter
Solomon
has
no
idea
you're
in
Washington
today."
The
man's
southern
accent
disappeared,
and
his
voice
morphed
into
a
deeper,
mellifluous
whisper.
"You
are
here,
Mr.
Langdon,
because
/
want
you
here."
Inside
the
Statuary
Hall,
Robert
Langdon
clutched
his
cell
phone
to
his
ear
and
paced
in
a
tight
circle.
"Who
the
hell
are
you?"
The
man's
reply
was
a
silky
calm
whisper.
"Do
not
be
alarmed,
Professor.
You
have
been
summoned
here
for
a
reason."
"Summoned?"
Langdon
felt
like
a
caged
animal.
"Try
kidnapped!"
"Hardly."
The
man's
voice
was
eerily
serene.
"If
I
wanted
to
harm
you,
you
would
be
dead
in
your
Town
Car
right
now."
He
let
the
words
hang
for
a
moment.
"My
intentions
are
purely
noble,
I
assure
you.
I
would
simply
like
to
offer
you
an
invitation."
No
thanks.
Ever
since
his
experiences
in
Europe
over
the
last
several
years,
Langdon'
s
unwanted
celebrity
had
made
him
a
magnet
for
nut-cases,
and
this
one
had
just
crossed
a
very
serious
line.
"Look,
I
don't
know
what
the
hell
is
going
on
here,
but
I'm
hanging
up
"Unwise,"
said
the
man.
"Your
window
of
opportunity
is
very
small
if
you
want
to
save
Peter
Solomon's
soul."
Langdon
drew
a
sharp
breath.
"What
did
you
say?"
"I'm
sure
you
heard
me."
The
way
this
man
had
uttered
Peter's
name
had
stopped
Langdon
cold.
"What
do
you
know
about
Peter?"
"At
this
point,
I
know
his
deepest
secrets.
Mr.
Solomon
is
my
guest,
and
I
can
be
a
persuasive
host."
This
can
't
be
happening.
"You
don't
have
Peter."
"I
answered
his
private
cell
phone.
That
should
give
you
pause."
"I'm
calling
the
police."
"No
need,"
the
man
said.
"The
authorities
will
join
you
momentarily."
What
is
this
lunatic
talking
about?
Langdon'
s
tone
hardened.
"If
you
have
Peter,
put
him
on
the
phone
right
now.""
"That's
impossible.
Mr.
Solomon
is
trapped
in
an
unfortunate
place."
The
man
paused.
"He
is
in
the
Araf."
"Where?"
Langdon
realized
he
was
clutching
his
phone
so
tightly
his
fingers
were
going
numb.
"The
Araf?
Hamistagan?
That
place
to
which
Dante
devoted
the
canticle
immediately
following
his
legendary
InfernoT
The
man's
religious
and
literary
references
solidified
Langdon'
s
suspicion
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
madman.
The
second
canticle.
Langdon
knew
it
well;
nobody
escaped
Phillips
Exeter
Academy
without
reading
Dante.
"You're
saying
you
think
Peter
Solomon
is
in
purgatoryT
"A
crude
word
you
Christians
use,
but
yes,
Mr.
Solomon
is
in
the
in-between."
The
man's
words
hung
in
Langdon'
s
ear.
"Are
you
saying
Peter
is
deadV
"Not
exactly,
no."
"Not
exactly?!"
Langdon
yelled,
his
voice
echoing
sharply
in
the
hall.
A
family
of
tourists
looked
over
at
him.
He
turned
away
and
lowered
his
voice.
"Death
is
usually
an
all-or-nothing
thing!"
"You
surprise
me,
Professor.
I
expected
you
to
have
a
better
understanding
of
the
mysteries
of
life
and
death.
There
is
a
world
in
between
a
world
in
which
Peter
Solomon
is
hovering
at
the
moment.
He
can
either
return
to
your
world,
or
he
can
move
on
to
the
next
depending
on
your
actions
right
now."
Langdon
tried
to
process
this.
"What
do
you
want
from
me?"
"It's
simple.
You
have
been
given
access
to
something
quite
ancient.
And
tonight,
you
will
share
it
with
me."
"I
have
no
idea
what
you're
talking
about."
"No?
You
pretend
not
to
understand
the
ancient
secrets
that
have
been
entrusted
to
you?"
Langdon
felt
a
sudden
sinking
sensation,
now
guessing
what
this
was
probably
about.
Ancient
secrets.
He
had
not
uttered
a
word
to
anyone
about
his
experiences
in
Paris
several
years
earlier,
but
Grail
fanatics
had
followed
the
media
coverage
closely,
some
connecting
the
dots
and
believing
Langdon
was
now
privy
to
secret
information
regarding
the
Holy
Grail
perhaps
even
its
location.
"Look,"
Langdon
said,
"if
this
is
about
the
Holy
Grail,
I
can
assure
you
I
know
nothing
more
than
"Don't
insult
my
intelligence,
Mr.
Langdon,"
the
man
snapped.
"I
have
no
interest
in
anything
so
frivolous
as
the
Holy
Grail
or
mankind's
pathetic
debate
over
whose
version
of
history
is
correct.
Circular
arguments
over
the
semantics
of
faith
hold
no
interest
for
me.
Those
are
questions
answered
only
through
death."
The
stark
words
left
Langdon
confused.
"Then
what
the
hell
is
this
about?"
The
man
paused
for
several
seconds.
"As
you
may
know,
there
exists
within
this
city
an
ancient
portal."
An
ancient
portal?
"And
tonight,
Professor,
you
will
unlock
it
for
me.
You
should
be
honored
I
contacted
you
this
is
the
invitation
of
your
lifetime.
You
alone
have
been
chosen."
And
you
have
lost
your
mind.
"I'm
sorry,
but
you've
chosen
poorly,"
Langdon
said.
"I
don't
know
anything
about
any
ancient
portal."
"You
don't
understand,
Professor.
It
was
not
/
who
chose
you
it
was
Peter
Solomon."
"What?"
Langdon
replied,
his
voice
barely
a
whisper.
"Mr.
Solomon
told
me
how
to
find
the
portal,
and
he
confessed
to
me
that
only
one
man
on
earth
could
unlock
it.
And
he
said
that
man
is
you."
"If
Peter
said
that,
he
was
mistaken
or
lying."
"I
think
not.
He
was
in
a
fragile
state
when
he
confessed
that
fact,
and
I
am
inclined
to
believe
him."
Langdon
felt
a
stab
of
anger.
"I'm
warning
you,
if
you
hurt
Peter
in
any
"It's
far
too
late
for
that,"
the
man
said
in
an
amused
tone.
"I've
already
taken
what
I
need
from
Peter
Solomon.
But
for
his
sake,
I
suggest
you
provide
what
I
need
from
you.
Time
is
of
the
essence
for
both
of
you.
I
suggest
you
find
the
portal
and
unlock
it.
Peter
will
point
the
way."
Peter?
"I
thought
you
said
Peter
was
in
'purgatory.'"
"As
above,
so
below,"
the
man
said.
Langdon
felt
a
deepening
chill.
This
strange
response
was
an
ancient
Hermetic
adage
that
proclaimed
a
belief
in
the
physical
connection
between
heaven
and
earth.
As
above,
so
below.
Langdon
eyed
the
vast
room
and
wondered
how
everything
had
veered
so
suddenly
out
of
control
tonight.
"Look,
I
don't
know
how
to
find
any
ancient
portal.
I'm
calling
the
police."
"It
really
hasn't
dawned
on
you
yet,
has
it?
Why
you
were
chosen?"
"No,"
Langdon
said.
"It
will,"
he
replied,
chuckling.
"Any
moment
now."
Then
the
line
went
dead.
Langdon
stood
rigid
for
several
terrifying
moments,
trying
to
process
what
had
just
happened.
Suddenly,
in
the
distance,
he
heard
an
unexpected
sound.
It
was
coming
from
the
Rotunda.
Someone
was
screaming.
Robert
Langdon
had
entered
the
Capitol
Rotunda
many
times
in
his
life,
but
never
at
a
full
sprint.
As
he
ran
through
the
north
entrance,
he
spotted
a
group
of
tourists
clustered
in
the
center
of
the
room.
A
small
boy
was
screaming,
and
his
parents
were
trying
to
console
him.
Others
were
crowding
around,
and
several
security
guards
were
doing
their
best
to
restore
order.
"He
pulled
it
out
of
his
sling,"
someone
said
frantically,
"and
just
left
it
there!"
As
Langdon
drew
nearer,
he
got
his
first
glimpse
of
what
was
causing
all
the
commotion.
Admittedly,
the
object
on
the
Capitol
floor
was
odd,
but
its
presence
hardly
warranted
screaming.
The
device
on
the
floor
was
one
Langdon
had
seen
many
times.
The
Harvard
art
department
had
dozens
of
these
life-size
plastic
models
used
by
sculptors
and
painters
to
help
them
render
the
human
body's
most
complex
feature,
which,
surprisingly,
was
not
the
human
face
but
rather
the
human
hand.
Someone
left
a
mannequin
hand
in
the
Rotunda
?
Mannequin
hands,
or
handequins
as
some
called
them,
had
articulated
fingers
enabling
an
artist
to
pose
the
hand
in
whatever
position
he
wanted,
which
for
sophomoric
college
students
was
often
with
the
middle
finger
extended
straight
up
in
the
air.
This
handequin,
however,
had
been
positioned
with
its
index
finger
and
thumb
pointing
up
toward
the
ceiling.
As
Langdon
drew
nearer,
though,
he
realized
this
handequin
was
unusual.
Its
plastic
surface
was
not
smooth
like
most.
Instead,
the
surface
was
mottled
and
slightly
wrinkled,
and
appeared
almost
Like
real
skin.
Langdon
stopped
abruptly.
Now
he
saw
the
blood.
My
God!
The
severed
wrist
appeared
to
have
been
skewered
onto
a
spiked
wooden
base
so
that
it
would
stand
up.
A
wave
of
nausea
rushed
over
him.
Langdon
inched
closer,
unable
to
breathe,
seeing
now
that
the
tips
of
the
index
finger
and
thumb
had
been
decorated
with
tiny
tattoos.
The
tattoos,
however,
were
not
what
held
Langdon'
s
attention.
His
gaze
moved
instantly
to
the
familiar
golden
ring
on
the
fourth
finger.
No.
Langdon
recoiled.
His
world
began
to
spin
as
he
realized
he
was
looking
at
the
severed
right
hand
of
Peter
Solomon.
Why
isn't
Peter
answering?
Katherine
Solomon
wondered
as
she
hung
up
her
cell
phone.
Where
is
he?
For
three
years,
Peter
Solomon
had
always
been
the
first
to
arrive
for
their
weekly
seven
P.M.
Sunday-night
meetings.
It
was
their
private
family
ritual,
a
way
to
remain
connected
before
the
start
of
a
new
week,
and
for
Peter
to
stay
up-to-date
on
Katherine's
work
at
the
lab.
He
's
never
late,
she
thought,
and
he
always
answers
his
phone.
To
make
matters
worse,
Katherine
was
still
not
sure
what
she
was
going
to
say
to
him
when
he
did
finally
arrive.
How
do
I
even
begin
to
ask
him
about
what
I
found
out
today?
Her
footsteps
clicked
rhythmically
down
the
cement
corridor
that
ran
like
a
spine
through
the
SMSC.
Known
as
"The
Street,"
the
corridor
connected
the
building's
five
massive
storage
pods.
Forty
feet
overhead,
a
circulatory
system
of
orange
ductwork
throbbed
with
the
heartbeat
of
the
building
the
pulsing
sounds
of
thousands
of
cubic
feet
of
filtered
air
being
circulated.
Normally,
during
her
nearly
quarter-mile
walk
to
her
lab,
Katherine
felt
calmed
by
the
breathing
sounds
of
the
building.
Tonight,
however,
the
pulsing
had
her
on
edge.
What
she
had
learned
about
her
brother
today
would
have
troubled
anyone,
and
yet
because
Peter
was
the
only
family
she
had
in
the
world,
Katherine
felt
especially
disturbed
to
think
he
might
be
keeping
secrets
from
her.
As
far
as
she
knew,
he
had
kept
a
secret
from
her
only
once
a
wonderful
secret
that
was
hidden
at
the
end
of
this
very
hallway.
Three
years
ago,
her
brother
had
walked
Katherine
down
this
corridor,
introducing
her
to
the
SMSC
by
proudly
showing
off
some
of
the
building's
more
unusual
items
the
Mars
meteorite
ALH-
84001,
the
handwritten
pictographic
diary
of
Sitting
Bull,
a
collection
of
wax-sealed
Ball
jars
containing
original
specimens
collected
by
Charles
Darwin.
At
one
point,
they
walked
past
a
heavy
door
with
a
small
window.
Katherine
caught
a
glimpse
of
what
lay
beyond
and
gasped.
"What
in
the
world
is
thatll"
Her
brother
chuckled
and
kept
walking.
"Pod
Three.
It's
called
Wet
Pod.
Pretty
unusual
sight,
isn't
it?"
Terrifying
is
more
like
it.
Katherine
hurried
after
him.
This
building
was
like
another
planet
"What
I
really
want
to
show
you
is
in
Pod
Five,"
her
brother
said,
guiding
her
down
the
seemingly
endless
corridor.
"It's
our
newest
addition.
It
was
built
to
house
artifacts
from
the
basement
of
the
National
Museum
of
Natural
History.
That
collection
is
scheduled
for
relocation
here
in
about
five
years,
which
means
Pod
Five
is
sitting
empty
at
the
moment."
Katherine
glanced
over.
"Empty?
So
why
are
we
looking
at
it?"
Her
brother's
gray
eyes
flashed
a
familiar
mischief.
"It
occurred
to
me
that
because
nobody
is
using
the
space,
maybe
you
could
use
it."
"Me?"
"Sure.
I
thought
maybe
you
could
use
a
dedicated
lab
space
a
facility
where
you
can
actually
perform
some
of
the
theoretical
experiments
you've
been
developing
for
all
these
years."
Katherine
stared
at
her
brother
in
shock.
"But,
Peter,
those
experiments
are
theoretical!
To
actually
perform
them
would
be
almost
impossible."
"Nothing
is
impossible,
Katherine,
and
this
building
is
perfect
for
you.
The
SMSC
is
not
just
a
warehouse
of
treasures;
it's
one
of
the
world's
most
advanced
scientific
research
facilities.
We're
constantly
taking
pieces
from
the
collection
and
examining
them
with
the
best
quantitative
technologies
money
can
buy.
All
the
equipment
you
could
possibly
need
would
be
here
at
your
disposal."
"Peter,
the
technologies
required
to
run
these
experiments
are
"Already
in
place."
He
smiled
broadly.
"The
lab
is
done."
Katherine
stopped
short.
Her
brother
pointed
down
the
long
corridor.
"We're
going
to
see
it
now."
Katherine
could
barely
speak.
"You
you
built
me
a
lab?"
"It's
my
job.
The
Smithsonian
was
established
to
advance
scientific
knowledge.
As
secretary,
I
must
take
that
charge
seriously.
I
believe
the
experiments
you've
proposed
have
the
potential
to
push
the
boundaries
of
science
into
uncharted
territory."
Peter
stopped
and
looked
her
squarely
in
the
eyes.
"Whether
or
not
you
were
my
sister,
I
would
feel
obliged
to
support
this
research.
Your
ideas
are
brilliant.
The
world
deserves
to
see
where
they
lead."
"Peter,
I
can't
possibly
"Okay,
relax
it
was
my
own
money,
and
nobody's
using
Pod
Five
right
now.
When
you're
done
with
your
experiments,
you'll
move
out.
Besides,
Pod
Five
has
some
unique
properties
that
will
be
perfect
for
your
work."
Katherine
could
not
imagine
what
a
massive,
empty
pod
might
offer
that
would
serve
her
research,
but
she
sensed
she
was
about
to
find
out.
They
had
just
reached
a
steel
door
with
boldly
stenciled
letters:
POD
5
Her
brother
inserted
his
key
card
into
a
slot
and
an
electronic
keypad
lit
up.
He
raised
his
finger
to
type
his
access
code,
but
paused,
arching
his
eyebrows
in
the
same
mischievous
way
he
always
had
as
a
boy.
"You
sure
you're
ready?"
She
nodded.
My
brother,
always
the
showman.
"Stand
back."
Peter
hit
the
keys.
The
steel
door
hissed
loudly
open.
Beyond
the
threshold
was
only
inky
blackness
a
yawning
void.
A
hollow
moan
seemed
to
echo
out
of
the
depths.
Katherine
felt
a
cold
blast
of
air
emanating
from
within.
It
was
like
staring
into
the
Grand
Canyon
at
night.
"Picture
an
empty
airline
hangar
waiting
for
a
fleet
of
Airbuses,"
her
brother
said,
"and
you
get
the
basic
idea."
Katherine
felt
herself
take
a
step
backward.
"The
pod
itself
is
far
too
voluminous
to
be
heated,
but
your
lab
is
a
thermally
insulated
cinder-block
room,
roughly
a
cube,
located
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
pod
for
maximum
separation."
Katherine
tried
to
picture
it.
A
box
inside
a
box.
She
strained
to
see
into
the
darkness,
but
it
was
absolute.
"How
far
back?"
"Pretty
far
a
football
field
would
fit
easily
in
here.
I
should
warn
you,
though,
the
walk
is
a
little
unnerving.
It's
exceptionally
dark."
Katherine
peered
tentatively
around
the
corner.
"No
light
switch?"
"Pod
Five
is
not
yet
wired
for
electricity."
"But
then
how
can
a
lab
function?"
He
winked.
"Hydrogen
fuel
cell."
Katherine's
jaw
dropped.
"You're
kidding,
right?"
"Enough
clean
power
to
run
a
small
town.
Your
lab
enjoys
full
radio-frequency
separation
from
the
rest
of
the
building.
What's
more,
all
pod
exteriors
are
sealed
with
photo-resistant
membranes
to
protect
the
artifacts
inside
from
solar
radiation.
Essentially,
this
pod
is
a
sealed,
energy-neutral
environment."
Katherine
was
starting
to
comprehend
the
appeal
of
Pod
5.
Because
much
of
her
work
centered
on
quantifying
previously
unknown
energy
fields,
her
experiments
needed
to
be
performed
in
a
location
isolated
from
any
extraneous
radiation
or
"white
noise."
This
included
interference
as
subtle
as
"brain
radiation"
or
"thought
emissions"
generated
by
people
nearby.
For
this
reason,
a
university
campus
or
hospital
lab
wouldn't
work,
but
a
deserted
pod
at
the
SMSC
could
not
have
been
more
perfect.
"Let's
go
back
and
have
a
look."
Her
brother
was
grinning
as
he
stepped
into
the
vast
darkness.
"Just
follow
me."
Katherine
stalled
at
the
threshold.
Over
a
hundred
yards
in
total
darkness?
She
wanted
to
suggest
a
flashlight,
but
her
brother
had
already
disappeared
into
the
abyss.
"Peter?"
she
called.
"Leap
of
faith,"
he
called
back,
his
voice
already
fading
away.
"You'll
find
your
way.
Trust
me."
He's
kidding,
right?
Katherine's
heart
was
pounding
as
she
stepped
a
few
feet
over
the
threshold,
trying
to
peer
into
the
darkness.
/
can't
see
a
thing!
Suddenly
the
steel
door
hissed
and
slammed
shut
behind
her,
plunging
her
into
total
blackness.
Not
a
speck
of
light
anywhere.
"Peter?!"
Silence.
You
'11
find
your
way.
Trust
me.
Tentative,
she
inched
forward
blindly.
Leap
of
faith?
Katherine
could
not
even
see
her
hand
directly
in
front
of
her
face.
She
kept
moving
forward,
but
within
a
matter
of
seconds,
she
was
entirely
lost.
Where
am
I
going?
That
was
three
years
ago.
Now,
as
Katherine
arrived
at
the
same
heavy
metal
door,
she
realized
how
far
she
had
come
since
that
first
night.
Her
lab
nicknamed
the
Cube
had
become
her
home,
a
sanctuary
within
the
depths
of
Pod
5.
Exactly
as
her
brother
had
predicted,
she
had
found
her
way
through
the
darkness
that
night,
and
every
day
since
thanks
to
an
ingeniously
simple
guidance
system
that
her
brother
had
let
her
discover
for
herself.
Far
more
important,
her
brother's
other
prediction
had
come
true
as
well:
Katherine's
experiments
had
produced
astonishing
results,
particularly
in
the
last
six
months,
breakthroughs
that
would
alter
entire
paradigms
of
thinking.
Katherine
and
her
brother
had
agreed
to
keep
her
results
absolutely
secret
until
the
implications
were
more
fully
understood.
One
day
soon,
however,
Katherine
knew
she
would
publish
some
of
the
most
transformative
scientific
revelations
in
human
history.
A
secret
lab
in
a
secret
museum,
she
thought,
inserting
her
key
card
into
the
Pod
5
door.
The
keypad
lit
up,
and
Katherine
typed
her
PIN.
The
steel
door
hissed
open.
The
familiar
hollow
moan
was
accompanied
by
the
same
blast
of
cold
air.
As
always,
Katherine
felt
her
pulse
rate
start
to
climb.
Strangest
commute
on
earth.
Steeling
herself
for
the
journey,
Katherine
Solomon
glanced
at
her
watch
as
she
stepped
into
the
void.
Tonight,
however,
a
troubled
thought
followed
her
inside.
Where
is
Peter?
Capitol
police
chief
Trent
Anderson
had
overseen
security
in
the
U.S.
Capitol
Complex
for
over
a
decade.
A
burly,
square-chested
man
with
a
chiseled
face
and
red
hair,
he
kept
his
hair
cropped
in
a
buzz
cut,
giving
him
an
air
of
military
authority.
He
wore
a
visible
sidearm
as
a
warning
to
anyone
foolish
enough
to
question
the
extent
of
his
authority.
Anderson
spent
the
majority
of
his
time
coordinating
his
small
army
of
police
officers
from
a
high-tech
surveillance
center
in
the
basement
of
the
Capitol.
Here
he
oversaw
a
staff
of
technicians
who
watched
visual
monitors,
computer
readouts,
and
a
telephone
switchboard
that
kept
him
in
contact
with
the
many
security
personnel
he
commanded.
This
evening
had
been
unusually
quiet,
and
Anderson
was
pleased.
He
had
been
hoping
to
catch
a
bit
of
the
Redskins
game
on
the
flat-panel
television
in
his
office.
The
game
had
just
kicked
off
when
his
intercom
buzzed.
"Chief?"
Anderson
groaned
and
kept
his
eyes
on
the
television
as
he
pressed
the
button.
"Yeah."
"We've
got
some
kind
of
disturbance
in
the
Rotunda.
I've
got
officers
arriving
now,
but
I
think
you'll
want
to
have
a
look."
"Right."
Anderson
walked
into
the
security
nerve
center
a
compact,
neomodern
facility
packed
with
computer
monitors.
"What
have
you
got?"
The
technician
was
cueing
a
digital
video
clip
on
his
monitor.
"Rotunda
east
balcony
camera.
Twenty
seconds
ago."
He
played
the
clip.
Anderson
watched
over
the
technician'
s
shoulder.
The
Rotunda
was
almost
deserted
today,
dotted
with
just
a
few
tourists.
Anderson's
trained
eye
went
immediately
to
the
one
person
who
was
alone
and
moving
faster
than
all
the
others.
Shaved
head.
Green
army-surplus
jacket.
Injured
arm
in
a
sling.
Slight
limp.
Slouched
posture.
Talking
on
a
cell
phone.
The
bald
man's
footfalls
echoed
crisply
on
the
audio
feed
until,
suddenly,
arriving
at
the
exact
center
of
the
Rotunda,
he
stopped
short,
ended
his
phone
call,
and
then
knelt
down
as
if
to
tie
his
shoe.
But
instead
of
tying
a
shoe,
he
pulled
something
out
of
his
sling
and
set
it
on
the
floor.
Then
he
stood
up
and
limped
briskly
toward
the
east
exit.
Anderson
eyed
the
oddly
shaped
object
the
man
had
left
behind.
What
in
the
world?
It
was
about
eight
inches
tall
and
standing
vertically.
Anderson
crouched
closer
to
the
screen
and
squinted.
That
can't
be
what
it
looks
like!
As
the
bald
man
hurried
off,
disappearing
through
the
east
portico,
a
little
boy
nearby
could
be
heard
saying,
"Mommy,
that
man
dropped
something."
The
boy
drifted
toward
the
object
but
suddenly
stopped
short.
After
a
long,
motionless
beat,
he
pointed
and
let
out
a
deafening
scream.
Instantly,
the
police
chief
spun
and
ran
for
the
door,
barking
orders
as
he
went.
"Radio
all
points!
Find
the
bald
guy
with
the
sling
and
detain
him!
NOW!"
Dashing
out
of
the
security
center,
he
bounded
up
the
treads
of
the
well-worn
staircase
three
at
a
time.
The
security
feed
had
shown
the
bald
man
with
the
sling
leave
the
Rotunda
via
the
east
portico.
The
shortest
route
out
of
the
building
would
therefore
take
him
through
the
east-west
corridor,
which
was
just
ahead.
/
can
head
him
off.
As
he
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
rounded
the
corner,
Anderson
surveyed
the
quiet
hallway
before
him.
An
elderly
couple
strolled
at
the
far
end,
hand
in
hand.
Nearby,
a
blond
tourist
wearing
a
blue
blazer
was
reading
a
guidebook
and
studying
the
mosaic
ceiling
outside
the
House
chamber.
"Excuse
me,
sir!"
Anderson
barked,
running
toward
him.
"Have
you
seen
a
bald
man
with
a
sling
on
his
arm?"
The
man
looked
up
from
his
book
with
a
confused
expression.
"A
bald
man
with
a
sling!"
Anderson
repeated
more
firmly.
"Have
you
seen
him?"
The
tourist
hesitated
and
glanced
nervously
toward
the
far
eastern
end
of
the
hallway.
"Uh
yes,"
he
said.
"I
think
he
just
ran
past
me
to
that
staircase
over
there."
He
pointed
down
the
hall.
Anderson
pulled
out
his
radio
and
yelled
into
it.
"All
points
!
The
suspect
is
headed
for
the
southeast
exit.
Converge!"
He
stowed
the
radio
and
yanked
his
sidearm
from
its
holster,
running
toward
the
exit.
Thirty
seconds
later,
at
a
quiet
exit
on
the
east
side
of
the
Capitol,
the
powerfully
built
blond
man
in
the
blue
blazer
stepped
into
the
damp
night
air.
He
smiled,
savoring
the
coolness
of
the
evening.
Transformation.
It
had
been
so
easy.
Only
a
minute
ago
he
had
limped
quickly
out
of
the
Rotunda
in
an
army-surplus
coat.
Stepping
into
a
darkened
alcove,
he
shed
his
coat,
revealing
the
blue
blazer
he
wore
underneath.
Before
abandoning
his
surplus
jacket,
he
pulled
a
blond
wig
from
the
pocket
and
fit
it
snugly
on
his
head.
Then
he
stood
up
straight,
pulled
a
slim
Washington
guidebook
from
his
blazer,
and
stepped
calmly
from
the
niche
with
an
elegant
gait.
Transformation.
This
is
my
gift.
As
Mal'akh's
mortal
legs
carried
him
toward
his
waiting
limousine,
he
arched
his
back,
standing
to
his
full
six-foot-three
height
and
throwing
back
his
shoulders.
He
inhaled
deeply,
letting
the
air
fill
his
lungs.
He
could
feel
the
wings
of
the
tattooed
phoenix
on
his
chest
opening
wide.
If
they
only
knew
my
power,
he
thought,
gazing
out
at
the
city.
Tonight
my
transformation
will
be
complete.
Mal'akh
had
played
his
cards
artfully
within
the
Capitol
Building,
showing
obeisance
to
all
the
ancient
etiquettes.
The
ancient
invitation
has
been
delivered.
If
Langdon
had
not
yet
grasped
his
role
here
tonight,
soon
he
would.
For
Robert
Langdon,
the
Capitol
Rotunda
like
St.
Peter's
Basilica
always
had
a
way
of
taking
him
by
surprise.
Intellectually,
he
knew
the
room
was
so
large
that
the
Statue
of
Liberty
could
stand
comfortably
inside
it,
but
somehow
the
Rotunda
always
felt
larger
and
more
hallowed
than
he
anticipated,
as
if
there
were
spirits
in
the
air.
Tonight,
however,
there
was
only
chaos.
Capitol
police
officers
were
sealing
the
Rotunda
while
attempting
to
herd
distraught
tourists
away
from
the
hand.
The
little
boy
was
still
crying.
A
bright
light
flashed
a
tourist
taking
a
photo
of
the
hand
and
several
guards
immediately
detained
the
man,
taking
his
camera
and
escorting
him
off.
In
the
confusion,
Langdon
felt
himself
moving
forward
in
a
trance,
slipping
through
the
crowd,
inching
closer
to
the
hand.
Peter
Solomon's
severed
right
hand
was
standing
upright,
the
flat
plane
of
the
detached
wrist
skewered
down
onto
the
spike
of
a
small
wooden
stand.
Three
of
the
fingers
were
closed
in
a
fist,
while
the
thumb
and
index
finger
were
fully
extended,
pointing
up
toward
the
soaring
dome.
"Everyone
back!"
an
officer
called.
Langdon
was
close
enough
now
that
he
could
see
dried
blood,
which
had
run
down
from
the
wrist
and
coagulated
on
the
wooden
base.
Postmortem
wounds
don't
bleed
which
means
Peter
is
alive.
Langdon
didn't
know
whether
to
be
relieved
or
nauseated.
Peter's
hand
was
removed
while
he
was
alive?
Bile
rose
in
his
throat.
He
thought
of
all
the
times
his
dear
friend
had
extended
this
same
hand
to
shake
Langdon's
or
offer
a
warm
embrace.
For
several
seconds,
Langdon
felt
his
mind
go
blank,
like
an
untuned
television
set
broadcasting
only
static.
The
first
clear
image
that
broke
through
was
utterly
unexpected.
A
crown
and
a
star.
Langdon
crouched
down,
eyeing
the
tips
of
Peter's
thumb
and
index
finger.
Tattoos?
Incredibly,
the
monster
who
had
done
this
appeared
to
have
tattooed
tiny
symbols
on
Peter's
fingertips.
On
the
thumb
a
crown.
On
the
index
finger
a
star.
This
can't
be.
The
two
symbols
registered
instantly
in
Langdon's
mind,
amplifying
this
already
horrific
scene
into
something
almost
otherworldly.
These
symbols
had
appeared
together
many
times
in
history,
and
always
in
the
same
place
on
the
fingertips
of
a
hand.
It
was
one
of
the
ancient
world's
most
coveted
and
secretive
icons.
The
Hand
of
the
Mysteries.
The
icon
was
rarely
seen
anymore,
but
throughout
history
it
had
symbolized
a
powerful
call
to
action.
Langdon
strained
to
comprehend
the
grotesque
artifact
now
before
him.
Someone
crafted
the
Hand
of
the
Mysteries
out
of
Peter's
hand?
It
was
unthinkable.
Traditionally,
the
icon
was
sculpted
in
stone
or
wood
or
rendered
as
a
drawing.
Langdon
had
never
heard
of
the
Hand
of
the
Mysteries
being
fashioned
from
actual
flesh.
The
concept
was
abhorrent.
"Sir?"
a
guard
said
behind
Langdon.
"Please
step
back."
Langdon
barely
heard
him.
There
are
other
tattoos.
Although
he
could
not
see
the
fingertips
of
the
three
clenched
fingers,
Langdon
knew
these
fingertips
would
bear
their
own
unique
markings.
That
was
the
tradition.
Five
symbols
in
total.
Through
the
millennia,
the
symbols
on
the
fingertips
of
the
Hand
of
the
Mysteries
had
never
changed
nor
had
the
hand's
iconic
purpose.
The
hand
represents
an
invitation.
Langdon
felt
a
sudden
chill
as
he
recalled
the
words
of
the
man
who
had
brought
him
here.
Professor,
tonight
you
are
receiving
the
invitation
of
your
lifetime.
In
ancient
times,
the
Hand
of
the
Mysteries
actually
served
as
the
most
coveted
invitation
on
earth.
To
receive
this
icon
was
a
sacred
summons
to
join
an
elite
group
those
who
were
said
to
guard
the
secret
wisdom
of
all
the
ages.
The
invitation
not
only
was
a
great
honor,
but
it
signified
that
a
master
believed
you
were
worthy
to
receive
this
hidden
wisdom.
The
hand
of
the
master
extended
to
the
initiate.
"Sir,"
the
guard
said,
putting
a
firm
hand
on
Langdon's
shoulder.
"I
need
you
to
back
up
right
now."
"I
know
what
this
means,"
Langdon
managed.
"I
can
help
you."
"Now!"
the
guard
said.
"My
friend
is
in
trouble.
We
have
to
Langdon
felt
powerful
arms
pulling
him
up
and
leading
him
away
from
the
hand.
He
simply
let
it
happen
feeling
too
off
balance
to
protest.
A
formal
invitation
had
just
been
delivered.
Someone
was
summoning
Langdon
to
unlock
a
mystical
portal
that
would
unveil
a
world
of
ancient
mysteries
and
hidden
knowledge.
But
it
was
all
madness.
Delusions
of
a
lunatic.
Mal'akh's
stretch
limousine
eased
away
from
the
U.S.
Capitol,
moving
eastward
down
Independence
Avenue.
A
young
couple
on
the
sidewalk
strained
to
see
through
the
tinted
rear
windows,
hoping
to
glimpse
a
VIP.
I'm
in
front,
Mal'akh
thought,
smiling
to
himself.
Mal'akh
loved
the
feeling
of
power
he
got
from
driving
this
massive
car
all
alone.
None
of
his
other
five
cars
offered
him
what
he
needed
tonight
the
guarantee
of
privacy.
Total
privacy.
Limousines
in
this
city
enjoyed
a
kind
of
unspoken
immunity.
Embassies
on
wheels.
Police
officers
who
worked
near
Capitol
Hill
were
never
certain
what
power
broker
they
might
mistakenly
pull
over
in
a
limousine,
and
so
most
simply
chose
not
to
take
the
chance.
As
Mal'akh
crossed
the
Anacostia
River
into
Maryland,
he
could
feel
himself
moving
closer
to
Katherine,
pulled
onward
by
destiny's
gravity.
/
am
being
called
to
a
second
task
tonight
one
I
had
not
imagined.
Last
night,
when
Peter
Solomon
told
the
last
of
his
secrets,
Mal'akh
had
learned
of
the
existence
of
a
secret
lab
in
which
Katherine
Solomon
had
performed
miracles
staggering
breakthroughs
that
Mal'akh
realized
would
change
the
world
if
they
were
ever
made
known.
Her
work
will
unveil
the
true
nature
of
all
things.
For
centuries
the
"brightest
minds"
on
earth
had
ignored
the
ancient
sciences,
mocking
them
as
ignorant
superstitions,
arming
themselves
instead
with
smug
skepticism
and
dazzling
new
technologies
tools
that
led
them
only
further
from
the
truth.
Every
generation
's
breakthroughs
are
proven
false
by
the
next
generation
's
technology.
And
so
it
had
gone
through
the
ages.
The
more
man
learned,
the
more
he
realized
he
did
not
know.
For
millennia,
mankind
had
wandered
in
the
darkness
but
now,
as
had
been
prophesied,
there
was
a
change
coming.
After
hurtling
blindly
through
history,
mankind
had
reached
a
crossroads.
This
moment
had
been
predicted
long
ago,
prophesied
by
the
ancient
texts,
by
the
primeval
calendars,
and
even
by
the
stars
themselves.
The
date
was
specific,
its
arrival
imminent.
It
would
be
preceded
by
a
brilliant
explosion
of
knowledge
a
flash
of
clarity
to
illuminate
the
darkness
and
give
mankind
a
final
chance
to
veer
away
from
the
abyss
and
take
the
path
of
wisdom.
I
have
come
to
obscure
the
light,
Mal'akh
thought.
This
is
my
role.
Fate
had
linked
him
to
Peter
and
Katherine
Solomon.
The
breakthroughs
Katherine
Solomon
had
made
within
the
SMSC
would
risk
opening
floodgates
of
new
thinking,
starting
a
new
Renaissance.
Katherine'
s
revelations,
if
made
public,
would
become
a
catalyst
that
would
inspire
mankind
to
rediscover
the
knowledge
he
had
lost,
empowering
him
beyond
all
imagination.
Katherine
's
destiny
is
to
light
this
torch.
Mine
is
to
extinguish
it.
In
total
darkness,
Katherine
Solomon
groped
for
the
outer
door
of
her
lab.
Finding
it,
she
heaved
open
the
lead-lined
door
and
hurried
into
the
small
entry
room.
The
journey
across
the
void
had
taken
only
ninety
seconds,
and
yet
her
heart
was
pounding
wildly.
After
three
years,
you'd
think
I'd
be
used
to
that.
Katherine
always
felt
relieved
to
escape
the
blackness
of
Pod
5
and
step
into
this
clean,
well-lit
space.
The
"Cube"
was
a
massive
windowless
box.
Every
inch
of
the
interior
walls
and
ceiling
was
covered
with
a
stiff
mesh
of
titanium-coated
lead
fiber,
giving
the
impression
of
a
giant
cage
built
inside
a
cement
enclosure
Dividers
of
frosted
Plexiglas
separated
the
space
into
different
compartments
a
laboratory,
a
control
room,
a
mechanical
room,
a
bathroom,
and
a
small
research
library.
Katherine
strode
briskly
into
the
main
lab.
The
bright
and
sterile
work
space
glistened
with
advanced
quantitative
equipment:
paired
electro
encephalographs,
a
femtosecond
comb,
a
magneto-optical
trap,
and
quantum-
indeterminate
electronic
noise
REGs,
more
simply
known
as
Random
Event
Generators.
Despite
Noetic
Science's
use
of
cutting-edge
technologies,
the
discoveries
themselves
were
far
more
mystical
than
the
cold,
high-tech
machines
that
were
producing
them.
The
stuff
of
magic
and
myth
was
fast
becoming
reality
as
the
shocking
new
data
poured
in,
all
of
it
supporting
the
basic
ideology
of
Noetic
Science
the
untapped
potential
of
the
human
mind.
The
overall
thesis
was
simple:
We
have
barely
scratched
the
surface
of
our
mental
and
spiritual
capabilities.
Experiments
at
facilities
like
the
Institute
of
Noetic
Sciences
(IONS)
in
California
and
the
Princeton
Engineering
Anomalies
Research
Lab
(PEAR)
had
categorically
proven
that
human
thought,
if
properly
focused,
had
the
ability
to
affect
and
change
physical
mass.
Their
experiments
were
no
"spoon-bending"
parlor
tricks,
but
rather
highly
controlled
inquiries
that
all
produced
the
same
extraordinary
result:
our
thoughts
actually
interacted
with
the
physical
world,
whether
or
not
we
knew
it,
effecting
change
all
the
way
down
to
the
subatomic
realm.
Mind
over
matter.
In
2001,
in
the
hours
following
the
horrifying
events
of
September
11,
the
field
of
Noetic
Science
made
a
quantum
leap
forward.
Four
scientists
discovered
that
as
the
frightened
world
came
together
and
focused
in
shared
grief
on
this
single
tragedy,
the
outputs
of
thirty-seven
different
Random
Event
Generators
around
the
world
suddenly
became
significantly
less
random.
Somehow,
the
oneness
of
this
shared
experience,
the
coalescing
of
millions
of
minds,
had
affected
the
randomizing
function
of
these
machines,
organizing
their
outputs
and
bringing
order
from
chaos.
The
shocking
discovery,
it
seemed,
paralleled
the
ancient
spiritual
belief
in
a
"cosmic
consciousness"
a
vast
coalescing
of
human
intention
that
was
actually
capable
of
interacting
with
physical
matter.
Recently,
studies
in
mass
meditation
and
prayer
had
produced
similar
results
in
Random
Event
Generators,
fueling
the
claim
that
human
consciousness,
as
Noetic
author
Lynne
McTaggart
described
it,
was
a
substance
outside
the
confines
of
the
body
a
highly
ordered
energy
capable
of
changing
the
physical
world.
Katherine
had
been
fascinated
by
McTaggart'
s
book
The
Intention
Experiment,
and
her
global,
Web-based
study
theintentionexperiment.com
aimed
at
discovering
how
human
intention
could
affect
the
world.
A
handful
of
other
progressive
texts
had
also
piqued
Katherine'
s
interest.
From
this
foundation,
Katherine
Solomon's
research
had
vaulted
forward,
proving
that
"focused
thought"
could
affect
literally
anything
the
growth
rate
of
plants,
the
direction
that
fish
swam
in
a
bowl,
the
manner
in
which
cells
divided
in
a
petri
dish,
the
synchronization
of
separately
automated
systems,
and
the
chemical
reactions
in
one's
own
body.
Even
the
crystalline
structure
of
a
newly
forming
solid
was
rendered
mutable
by
one's
mind;
Katherine
had
created
beautifully
symmetrical
ice
crystals
by
sending
loving
thoughts
to
a
glass
of
water
as
it
froze.
Incredibly,
the
converse
was
also
true:
when
she
sent
negative,
polluting
thoughts
to
the
water,
the
ice
crystals
froze
in
chaotic,
fractured
forms.
Human
thought
can
literally
transform
the
physical
world.
As
Katherine'
s
experiments
grew
bolder,
her
results
became
more
astounding.
Her
work
in
this
lab
had
proven
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
"mind
over
matter"
was
not
just
some
New
Age
self-help
mantra.
The
mind
had
the
ability
to
alter
the
state
of
matter
itself,
and,
more
important,
the
mind
had
the
power
to
encourage
the
physical
world
to
move
in
a
specific
direction.
We
are
the
masters
of
our
own
universe.
At
the
subatomic
level,
Katherine
had
shown
that
particles
themselves
came
in
and
out
of
existence
based
solely
on
her
intention
to
observe
them.
In
a
sense,
her
desire
to
see
a
particle
manifested
that
particle.
Heisenberg
had
hinted
at
this
reality
decades
ago,
and
now
it
had
be
come
a
fundamental
principle
of
Noetic
Science.
In
the
words
of
Lynne
McTaggart:
"Living
consciousness
somehow
is
the
influence
that
turns
the
possibility
of
something
into
something
real.
The
most
essential
ingredient
in
creating
our
universe
is
the
consciousness
that
observes
it."
The
most
astonishing
aspect
of
Katherine'
s
work,
however,
had
been
the
realization
that
the
mind's
ability
to
affect
the
physical
world
could
be
augmented
through
practice.
Intention
was
a
learned
skill.
Like
meditation,
harnessing
the
true
power
of
"thought"
required
practice.
More
important
some
people
were
born
more
skilled
at
it
than
others.
And
throughout
history,
there
had
been
those
few
who
had
become
true
masters.
This
is
the
missing
link
between
modern
science
and
ancient
mysticism.
Katherine
had
learned
this
from
her
brother,
Peter,
and
now,
as
her
thoughts
turned
back
to
him,
she
felt
a
deepening
concern.
She
walked
to
the
lab's
research
library
and
peered
in.
Empty.
The
library
was
a
small
reading
room
two
Morris
chairs,
a
wooden
table,
two
floor
lamps,
and
a
wall
of
mahogany
bookshelves
that
held
some
five
hundred
books.
Katherine
and
Peter
had
pooled
their
favorite
texts
here,
writings
on
everything
from
particle
physics
to
ancient
mysticism.
Their
collection
had
grown
into
an
eclectic
fusion
of
new
and
old
of
cutting-edge
and
historical.
Most
of
Katherine'
s
books
bore
titles
like
Quantum
Consciousness,
The
New
Physics,
and
Principles
of
Neural
Science.
Her
brother's
bore
older,
more
esoteric
titles
like
the
Kybalion,
the
Zohar,
The
Dancing
Wu
Li
Masters,
and
a
translation
of
the
Sumerian
tablets
from
the
British
Museum.
"The
key
to
our
scientific
future,"
her
brother
often
said,
"is
hidden
in
our
past."
A
lifelong
scholar
of
history,
science,
and
mysticism,
Peter
had
been
the
first
to
encourage
Katherine
to
boost
her
university
science
education
with
an
understanding
of
early
Hermetic
philosophy.
She
had
been
only
nineteen
years
old
when
Peter
sparked
her
interest
in
the
link
between
modern
science
and
ancient
mysticism.
"So
tell
me,
Kate,"
her
brother
had
asked
while
she
was
home
on
vacation
during
her
sophomore
year
at
Yale.
"What
are
Elis
reading
these
days
in
theoretical
physics?"
Katherine
had
stood
in
her
family's
book-
filled
library
and
recited
her
demanding
reading
list.
"Impressive,"
her
brother
replied.
"Einstein,
Bohr,
and
Hawking
are
modern
geniuses.
But
are
you
reading
anything
older?"
Katherine
scratched
her
head.
"You
mean
like
Newton?"
He
smiled.
"Keep
going."
At
twenty-seven,
Peter
had
already
made
a
name
for
himself
in
the
academic
world,
and
he
and
Katherine
had
grown
to
savor
this
kind
of
playful
intellectual
sparring.
Older
than
Newton?
Katherine'
s
head
now
filled
with
distant
names
like
Ptolemy,
Pythagoras,
and
Hermes
Trismegistus.
Nobody
reads
that
stuff
anymore.
Her
brother
ran
a
finger
down
the
long
shelf
of
cracked
leather
bindings
and
old
dusty
tomes.
"The
scientific
wisdom
of
the
ancients
was
staggering
modern
physics
is
only
now
beginning
to
comprehend
it
all."
"Peter,"
she
said,
"you
already
told
me
that
the
Egyptians
understood
levers
and
pulleys
long
before
Newton,
and
that
the
early
alchemists
did
work
on
a
par
with
modern
chemistry,
but
so
what?
Today's
physics
deals
with
concepts
that
would
have
been
unimaginable
to
the
ancients."
"Like
what?"
"Well
like
entanglement
theory,
for
one!"
Subatomic
research
had
now
proven
categorically
that
all
matter
was
interconnected
entangled
in
a
single
unified
mesh
a
kind
of
universal
oneness.
"You're
telling
me
the
ancients
sat
around
discussing
entanglement
theory?"
"Absolutely!"
Peter
said,
pushing
his
long,
dark
bangs
out
of
his
eyes.
"Entanglement
was
at
the
core
of
primeval
beliefs.
Its
names
are
as
old
as
history
itself
Dharmakaya,
Tao,
Brahman.
In
fact,
man's
oldest
spiritual
quest
was
to
perceive
his
own
entanglement,
to
sense
his
own
interconnection
with
all
things.
He
has
always
wanted
to
become
'one'
with
the
universe
to
achieve
the
state
of
'at-one-ment.'Her
brother
raised
his
eyebrows.
"To
this
day,
Jews
and
Christians
still
strive
for
'atonement'
although
most
of
us
have
forgotten
it
is
actually
'at-one-ment'
we're
seeking."
Katherine
sighed,
having
forgotten
how
hard
it
was
to
argue
with
a
man
so
well
versed
in
history.
"Okay,
but
you're
talking
in
generalities.
I'm
talking
specific
physics."
"Then
be
specific."
His
keen
eyes
challenged
her
now.
"Okay,
how
about
something
as
simple
as
polarity
the
positive/negative
balance
of
the
subatomic
realm.
Obviously,
the
ancients
didn't
underst
"Hold
on!"
Her
brother
pulled
down
a
large
dusty
text,
which
he
dropped
loudly
on
the
library
table.
"Modern
polarity
is
nothing
but
the
'dual
world'
described
by
Krishna
here
in
the
Bhagavad
Gita
over
two
thousand
years
ago.
A
dozen
other
books
in
here,
including
the
Kybalion,
talk
about
binary
systems
and
the
opposing
forces
in
nature."
Katherine
was
skeptical.
"Okay,
but
if
we
talk
about
modern
discoveries
in
subatomics
the
Heisenberg
uncertainty
principle,
for
example
"Then
we
must
look
here,"
Peter
said,
striding
down
his
long
bookshelf
and
pulling
out
another
text.
"The
sacred
Hindu
Vendantic
scriptures
known
as
the
Upanishads."
He
dropped
the
tome
heavily
on
the
first.
"Heisenberg
and
Schrodinger
studied
this
text
and
credited
it
with
helping
them
formulate
some
of
their
theories."
The
showdown
continued
for
several
minutes,
and
the
stack
of
dusty
books
on
the
desk
grew
taller
and
taller.
Finally
Katherine
threw
up
her
hands
in
frustration.
"Okay!
You
made
your
point,
but
I
want
to
study
cutting-edge
theoretical
physics.
The
future
of
science!
I
really
doubt
Krishna
or
Vyasa
had
much
to
say
about
superstring
theory
and
multidimensional
cosmological
models."
"You're
right.
They
didn't."
Her
brother
paused,
a
smile
crossing
his
lips.
"If
you're
talking
superstring
theory"
He
wandered
over
to
the
bookshelf
yet
again.
"Then
you're
talking
this
book
here."
He
heaved
out
a
colossal
leather-bound
book
and
dropped
it
with
a
crash
onto
the
desk.
"Thirteenth-century
translation
of
the
original
medieval
Aramaic."
"Superstring
theory
in
the
thirteenth
century?!"
Katherine
wasn't
buying
it.
"Come
on!"
Superstring
theory
was
a
brand-new
cosmological
model.
Based
on
the
most
recent
scientific
observations,
it
suggested
the
multidimensional
universe
was
made
up
not
of
three
but
rather
of
ten
dimensions,
which
all
interacted
like
vibrating
strings,
similar
to
resonating
violin
strings.
Katherine
waited
as
her
brother
heaved
open
the
book,
ran
through
the
ornately
printed
table
of
contents,
and
then
flipped
to
a
spot
near
the
beginning
of
the
book.
"Read
this."
He
pointed
to
a
faded
page
of
text
and
diagrams.
Dutifully,
Katherine
studied
the
page.
The
translation
was
old-fashioned
and
very
hard
to
read,
but
to
her
utter
amazement,
the
text
and
drawings
clearly
outlined
the
exact
same
universe
heralded
by
modern
superstring
theory
a
ten-dimensional
universe
of
resonating
strings.
As
she
continued
reading,
she
suddenly
gasped
and
recoiled.
"My
God,
it
even
describes
how
six
of
the
dimensions
are
entangled
and
act
as
one?!"
She
took
a
frightened
step
backward.
"What
is
this
book?!"
Her
brother
grinned.
"Something
I'm
hoping
you'll
read
one
day."
He
flipped
back
to
the
title
page,
where
an
ornately
printed
plate
bore
three
words.
The
Complete
Zohar.
Although
Katherine
had
never
read
the
Zohar,
she
knew
it
was
the
fundamental
text
of
early
Jewish
mysticism,
once
believed
so
potent
that
it
was
reserved
only
for
the
most
erudite
rabbis.
Katherine
eyed
the
book.
"You're
saying
the
early
mystics
knew
their
universe
had
ten
dimensions?"
"Absolutely."
He
motioned
to
the
page's
illustration
of
ten
intertwined
circles
called
Sephiroth.
"Obviously,
the
nomenclature
is
esoteric,
but
the
physics
is
very
advanced."
Katherine
didn't
know
how
to
respond.
"But
then
why
don't
more
people
study
this?"
Her
brother
smiled.
"They
will."
"I
don't
understand."
"Katherine,
we
have
been
born
into
wonderful
times.
A
change
is
coming.
Human
beings
are
poised
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
age
when
they
will
begin
turning
their
eyes
back
to
nature
and
to
the
old
ways
back
to
the
ideas
in
books
like
the
Zohar
and
other
ancient
texts
from
around
the
world.
Powerful
truth
has
its
own
gravity
and
eventually
pulls
people
back
to
it.
There
will
come
a
day
when
modern
science
begins
in
earnest
to
study
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
that
will
be
the
day
that
mankind
begins
to
find
answers
to
the
big
questions
that
still
elude
him."
That
night,
Katherine
eagerly
began
reading
her
brother'
s
ancient
texts
and
quickly
came
to
understand
that
he
was
right.
The
ancients
possessed
profound
scientific
wisdom.
Today's
science
was
not
so
much
making
"discoveries"
as
it
was
making
"rediscoveries."
Mankind,
it
seemed,
had
once
grasped
the
true
nature
of
the
universe
but
had
let
go
and
forgotten.
Modern
physics
can
help
us
remember!
This
quest
had
become
Katherine's
mission
in
life
to
use
advanced
science
to
rediscover
the
lost
wisdom
of
the
ancients.
It
was
more
than
academic
thrill
that
kept
her
motivated.
Beneath
it
all
was
her
conviction
that
the
world
needed
this
understanding
now
more
than
ever.
At
the
rear
of
the
lab,
Katherine
saw
her
brother's
white
lab
coat
hanging
on
its
hook
along
with
her
own.
Reflexively,
she
pulled
out
her
phone
to
check
for
messages.
Nothing.
A
voice
echoed
again
in
her
memory.
That
which
your
brother
believes
is
hidden
in
D.C.
it
can
be
found.
Sometimes
a
legend
that
endures
for
centuries
endures
for
a
reason.
"No,"
Katherine
said
aloud.
"It
can't
possibly
be
real."
Sometimes
a
legend
was
just
that
a
legend.
Security
chief
Trent
Anderson
stormed
back
toward
the
Capitol
Rotunda,
fuming
at
the
failure
of
his
security
team.
One
of
his
men
had
just
found
a
sling
and
an
army-surplus
jacket
in
an
alcove
near
the
east
portico.
The
goddamn
guy
walked
right
out
of
here!
Anderson
had
already
assigned
teams
to
start
scanning
exterior
video,
but
by
the
time
they
found
anything,
this
guy
would
be
long
gone.
Now,
as
Anderson
entered
the
Rotunda
to
survey
the
damage,
he
saw
that
the
situation
had
been
contained
as
well
as
could
be
expected.
All
four
entrances
to
the
Rotunda
were
closed
with
as
inconspicuous
a
method
of
crowd
control
as
Security
had
at
its
disposal
a
velvet
swag,
an
apologetic
guard,
and
a
sign
that
read
THIS
ROOM
TEMPORARILY
CLOSED
FOR
CLEANING.
The
dozen
or
so
witnesses
were
all
being
herded
into
a
group
on
the
eastern
perimeter
of
the
room,
where
the
guards
were
collecting
cell
phones
and
cameras;
the
last
thing
Anderson
needed
was
for
one
of
these
people
to
send
a
cell-phone
snapshot
to
CNN.
One
of
the
detained
witnesses,
a
tall,
dark-haired
man
in
a
tweed
sport
coat,
was
trying
to
break
away
from
the
group
to
speak
to
the
chief.
The
man
was
currently
in
a
heated
discussion
with
the
guards.
"I'll
speak
to
him
in
a
moment,"
Anderson
called
over
to
the
guards.
"For
now,
please
hold
everyone
in
the
main
lobby
until
we
sort
this
out."
Anderson
turned
his
eyes
now
to
the
hand,
which
stood
at
attention
in
the
middle
of
the
room.
For
the
love
of
God.
In
fifteen
years
on
security
detail
for
the
Capitol
Building,
he
had
seen
some
strange
things.
But
nothing
like
this.
Forensics
had
better
get
here
fast
and
get
this
thing
out
of
my
building.
Anderson
moved
closer,
seeing
that
the
bloody
wrist
had
been
skewered
on
a
spiked
wooden
base
to
make
the
hand
stand
up.
Wood
and
flesh,
he
thought.
Invisible
to
metal
detectors.
The
only
metal
was
a
large
gold
ring,
which
Anderson
assumed
had
either
been
wanded
or
casually
pulled
off
the
dead
finger
by
the
suspect
as
if
it
were
his
own.
Anderson
crouched
down
to
examine
the
hand.
It
looked
as
if
it
had
belonged
to
a
man
of
about
sixty.
The
ring
bore
some
kind
of
ornate
seal
with
a
two-headed
bird
and
the
number
33.
Anderson
didn't
recognize
it.
What
really
caught
his
eye
were
the
tiny
tattoos
on
the
tips
of
the
thumb
and
index
finger.
A
goddamn
freak
show.
"Chief?"
One
of
the
guards
hurried
over,
holding
out
a
phone.
"Personal
call
for
you.
Security
switchboard
just
patched
it
through."
Anderson
looked
at
him
like
he
was
insane.
"I'm
in
the
middle
of
something
here,"
he
growled.
The
guard's
face
was
pale.
He
covered
the
mouthpiece
and
whispered.
"It's
CIA."
Anderson
did
a
double
take.
CIA
heard
about
this
already?!
"It's
their
Office
of
Security."
Anderson
stiffened.
Holy
shit.
He
glanced
uneasily
at
the
phone
in
the
guard's
hand.
In
Washington's
vast
ocean
of
intelligence
agencies,
the
CIA's
Office
of
Security
was
something
of
a
Bermuda
Triangle
a
mysterious
and
treacherous
region
from
which
all
who
knew
of
it
steered
clear
whenever
possible.
With
a
seemingly
self-destructive
mandate,
the
OS
had
been
created
by
the
CIA
for
one
strange
purpose
to
spy
on
the
CIA
itself.
Like
a
powerful
internal-affairs
office,
the
OS
monitored
all
CIA
employees
for
illicit
behavior:
misappropriation
of
funds,
selling
of
secrets,
stealing
classified
technologies,
and
use
of
illegal
torture
tactics,
to
name
a
few.
They
spy
on
America
's
spies.
With
investigative
carte
blanche
in
all
matters
of
national
security,
the
OS
had
a
long
and
potent
reach.
Anderson
could
not
fathom
why
they
would
be
interested
in
this
incident
at
the
Capitol,
or
how
they
had
found
out
so
fast.
Then
again,
the
OS
was
rumored
to
have
eyes
everywhere.
For
all
Anderson
knew,
they
had
a
direct
feed
of
U.S.
Capitol
security
cameras.
This
incident
did
not
match
OS
directives
in
any
way,
although
the
timing
of
the
call
seemed
too
coincidental
to
Anderson
to
be
about
anything
other
than
this
severed
hand.
"Chief?"The
guard
was
holding
the
phone
out
to
him
like
a
hot
potato.
"You
need
to
take
this
call
right
now.
It's"
He
paused
and
silently
mouthed
two
syllables.
"SA-TO."
Anderson
squinted
hard
at
the
man.
You've
got
to
be
kidding.
He
felt
his
palms
begin
to
sweat.
Sato
is
handling
this
personally?
The
overlord
of
the
Office
of
Security
Director
Inoue
Sato
was
a
legend
in
the
intelligence
community.
Born
inside
the
fences
of
a
Japanese
internment
camp
in
Manzanar,
California,
in
the
aftermath
of
Pearl
Harbor,
Sato
was
a
toughened
survivor
who
had
never
forgotten
the
horrors
of
war,
or
the
perils
of
insufficient
military
intelligence.
Now,
having
risen
to
one
of
the
most
secretive
and
potent
posts
in
U.S.
intelligence
work,
Sato
had
proven
an
uncompromising
patriot
as
well
as
a
terrifying
enemy
to
any
who
stood
in
opposition.
Seldom
seen
but
universally
feared,
the
OS
director
cruised
the
deep
waters
of
the
CIA
like
a
leviathan
who
surfaced
only
to
devour
its
prey.
Anderson
had
met
Sato
face-to-face
only
once,
and
the
memory
of
looking
into
those
cold
black
eyes
was
enough
to
make
him
count
his
blessings
that
he
would
be
having
this
conversation
by
telephone.
Anderson
took
the
phone
and
brought
it
to
his
lips.
"Director
Sato,"
he
said
in
as
friendly
a
voice
as
possible.
"This
is
Chief
Anderson.
How
may
I
"There
is
a
man
in
your
building
to
whom
I
need
to
speak
immediately."
The
OS
director's
voice
was
unmistakable
like
gravel
grating
on
a
chalkboard.
Throat
cancer
surgery
had
left
Sato
with
a
profoundly
unnerving
intonation
and
a
repulsive
neck
scar
to
match.
"I
want
you
to
find
him
for
me
immediately."
That's
all?
You
want
me
to
page
someone?
Anderson
felt
suddenly
hopeful
that
maybe
the
timing
of
this
call
was
pure
coincidence.
"Who
are
you
looking
for?"
"His
name
is
Robert
Langdon.
I
believe
he
is
inside
your
building
right
now."
Langdon?
The
name
sounded
vaguely
familiar,
but
Anderson
couldn't
quite
place
it.
He
was
now
wondering
if
Sato
knew
about
the
hand.
"I'm
in
the
Rotunda
at
the
moment,"
Anderson
said,
"but
we've
got
some
tourists
here
hold
on."
He
lowered
his
phone
and
called
out
to
the
group,
"Folks,
is
there
anyone
here
by
the
name
of
Langdon?"
After
a
short
silence,
a
deep
voice
replied
from
the
crowd
of
tourists.
"Yes.
I'm
Robert
Langdon."
Sato
knows
all.
Anderson
craned
his
neck,
trying
to
see
who
had
spoken
up.
The
same
man
who
had
been
trying
to
get
to
him
earlier
stepped
away
from
the
others.
He
looked
distraught
.
.
.
but
familiar
somehow.
Anderson
raised
the
phone
to
his
lips.
"Yes,
Mr.
Langdon
is
here."
"Put
him
on,"
Sato
said
coarsely.
Anderson
exhaled.
Better
him
than
me.
"Hold
on."
He
waved
Langdon
over.
As
Langdon
approached,
Anderson
suddenly
realized
why
the
name
sounded
familiar.
/
just
read
an
article
about
this
guy.
What
the
hell
is
he
doing
here?
Despite
Langdon'
s
six-foot
frame
and
athletic
build,
Anderson
saw
none
of
the
cold,
hardened
edge
he
expected
from
a
man
famous
for
surviving
an
explosion
at
the
Vatican
and
a
manhunt
in
Paris.
This
guy
eluded
the
French
police
in
loafers?
He
looked
more
like
someone
Anderson
would
expect
to
find
hearthside
in
some
Ivy
League
library
reading
Dostoyevsky.
"Mr.
Langdon?"Anderson
said,
walking
halfway
to
meet
him.
"I'm
Chief
Anderson.
I
handle
security
here.
You
have
a
phone
call."
"For
me?"
Langdon'
s
blue
eyes
looked
anxious
and
uncertain.
Anderson
held
out
the
phone.
"It's
the
CIA's
Office
of
Security."
"I've
never
heard
of
it."
Anderson
smiled
ominously.
"Well,
sir,
it's
heard
of
you."
Langdon
put
the
phone
to
his
ear.
"Yes?"
"Robert
Langdon?"
Director
Sato's
harsh
voice
blared
in
the
tiny
speaker,
loud
enough
that
Anderson
could
hear.
"Yes?"
Langdon
replied.
Anderson
stepped
closer
to
hear
what
Sato
was
saying.
"This
is
Director
Inoue
Sato,
Mr.
Langdon.
I
am
handling
a
crisis
at
the
moment,
and
I
believe
you
have
information
that
can
help
me."
Langdon
looked
hopeful.
"Is
this
about
Peter
Solomon?
Do
you
know
where
he
is?!"
Peter
Solomon?
Anderson
felt
entirely
out
of
the
loop.
"Professor,"
Sato
replied.
"I
am
asking
the
questions
at
the
moment."
"Peter
Solomon
is
in
very
serious
trouble,"
Langdon
exclaimed.
"Some
madman
just
"Excuse
me,"
Sato
said,
cutting
him
off.
Anderson
cringed.
Bad
move.
Interrupting
a
top
CIA
official's
line
of
questioning
was
a
mistake
only
a
civilian
would
make.
/
thought
Langdon
was
supposed
to
be
smart.
"Listen
carefully,"
Sato
said.
"As
we
speak,
this
nation
is
facing
a
crisis.
I
have
been
advised
that
you
have
information
that
can
help
me
avert
it.
Now,
I
am
going
to
ask
you
again.
What
information
do
you
possess?"
Langdon
looked
lost.
"Director,
I
have
no
idea
what
you're
talking
about.
All
I'm
concerned
with
is
finding
Peter
and
"No
idea?"
Sato
challenged.
Anderson
saw
Langdon
bristle.
The
professor
now
took
a
more
aggressive
tone.
"No,
sir.
No
damned
idea
at
all."
Anderson
winced.
Wrong.
Wrong.
Wrong.
Robert
Langdon
had
just
made
a
very
costly
mistake
in
dealing
with
Director
Sato.
Incredibly,
Anderson
now
realized
it
was
too
late.
To
his
astonishment,
Director
Sato
had
just
appeared
on
the
far
side
of
the
Rotunda,
and
was
approaching
fast
behind
Langdon.
Sato
is
in
the
building!
Anderson
held
his
breath
and
braced
for
impact.
Langdon
has
no
idea.
The
director's
dark
form
drew
closer,
phone
held
to
ear,
black
eyes
locked
like
two
lasers
on
Langdon'
s
back.
Langdon
clutched
the
police
chief's
phone
and
felt
a
rising
frustration
as
the
OS
director
pressed
him.
"I'm
sorry,
sir,"
Langdon
said
tersely,
"but
I
can't
read
your
mind.
What
do
you
want
from
me?"
"What
do
I
want
from
you?"
The
OS
director's
grating
voice
crackled
through
Langdon'
s
phone,
scraping
and
hollow,
like
that
of
a
dying
man
with
strep
throat.
As
the
man
spoke,
Langdon
felt
a
tap
on
his
shoulder.
He
turned
and
his
eyes
were
drawn
down
directly
into
the
face
of
a
tiny
Japanese
woman.
She
had
a
fierce
expression,
a
mottled
complexion,
thinning
hair,
tobacco-stained
teeth,
and
an
unsettling
white
scar
that
sliced
horizontally
across
her
neck.
The
woman's
gnarled
hand
held
a
cell
phone
to
her
ear,
and
when
her
lips
moved,
Langdon
heard
the
familiar
raspy
voice
through
his
cell
phone.
"What
do
I
want
from
you,
Professor?"
She
calmly
closed
her
phone
and
glared
at
him.
"For
starters,
you
can
stop
calling
me
'sir.'
Langdon
stared,
mortified.
"Ma'am,
I
apologize.
Our
connection
was
poor
and
"Our
connection
was
fine,
Professor,"
she
said.
"And
I
have
an
extremely
low
tolerance
for
bullshit."
Director
Inoue
Sato
was
a
fearsome
specimen
a
bristly
tempest
of
a
woman
who
stood
a
mere
four
feet
ten
inches.
She
was
bone
thin,
with
jagged
features
and
a
dermatological
condition
known
as
vitiligo,
which
gave
her
complexion
the
mottled
look
of
coarse
granite
blotched
with
lichen.
Her
rumpled
blue
pantsuit
hung
on
her
emaciated
frame
like
a
loose
sack,
the
open-necked
blouse
doing
nothing
to
hide
the
scar
across
her
neck.
It
had
been
noted
by
her
coworkers
that
Sato's
only
acquiescence
to
physical
vanity
appeared
to
be
that
of
plucking
her
substantial
mustache.
For
over
a
decade,
Inoue
Sato
had
overseen
the
CIA's
Office
of
Security.
She
possessed
an
off-the-chart
IQ
and
chillingly
accurate
instincts,
a
combination
which
girded
her
with
a
self-confidence
that
made
her
terrifying
to
anyone
who
could
not
perform
the
impossible.
Not
even
a
terminal
diagnosis
of
aggressive
throat
cancer
had
knocked
her
from
her
perch.
The
battle
had
cost
her
one
month
of
work,
half
her
voice
box,
and
a
third
of
her
body
weight,
but
she
returned
to
the
office
as
if
nothing
had
happened.
Inoue
Sato
appeared
to
be
indestructible.
Robert
Langdon
suspected
he
was
probably
not
the
first
to
mistake
Sato
for
a
man
on
the
phone,
but
the
director
was
still
glaring
at
him
with
simmering
black
eyes.
"Again,
my
apologies,
ma'am,"
Langdon
said.
"I'm
still
trying
to
get
my
bearings
here
the
person
who
claims
to
have
Peter
Solomon
tricked
me
into
coming
to
D.C.
this
evening."
He
pulled
the
fax
from
his
jacket.
"This
is
what
he
sent
me
earlier.
I
wrote
down
the
tail
number
of
the
plane
he
sent,
so
maybe
if
you
call
the
FAA
and
track
the
Sato's
tiny
hand
shot
out
and
snatched
the
sheet
of
paper.
She
stuck
it
in
her
pocket
without
even
opening
it.
"Professor,
I
am
running
this
investigation,
and
until
you
start
telling
me
what
I
want
to
know,
I
suggest
you
not
speak
unless
spoken
to."
Sato
now
spun
to
the
police
chief.
"Chief
Anderson,"
she
said,
stepping
entirely
too
close
and
staring
up
at
him
through
tiny
black
eyes,
"would
you
care
to
tell
me
what
the
hell
is
going
on
here?
The
guard
at
the
east
gate
told
me
you
found
a
human
hand
on
the
floor.
Is
that
true?"
Anderson
stepped
to
the
side
and
revealed
the
object
in
the
center
of
the
floor.
"Yes,
ma'am,
only
a
few
minutes
ago."
She
glanced
at
the
hand
as
if
it
were
nothing
more
than
a
misplaced
piece
of
clothing.
"And
yet
you
didn't
mention
it
to
me
when
I
called?"
"I
I
thought
you
knew."
"Do
not
lie
to
me."
Anderson
wilted
under
her
gaze,
but
his
voice
remained
confident.
"Ma'am,
this
situation
is
under
control."
"I
really
doubt
that,"
Sato
said,
with
equal
confidence.
"A
forensics
team
is
on
the
way.
Whoever
did
this
may
have
left
fingerprints."
Sato
looked
skeptical.
"I
think
someone
clever
enough
to
walk
through
your
security
checkpoint
with
a
human
hand
is
probably
clever
enough
not
to
leave
fingerprints."
"That
may
be
true,
but
I
have
a
responsibility
to
investigate."
"Actually,
I
am
relieving
you
of
your
responsibility
as
of
this
moment.
I'm
taking
over."
Anderson
stiffened.
"This
is
not
exactly
OS
domain,
is
it?"
"Absolutely.
This
is
an
issue
of
national
security."
Peter's
hand?
Langdon
wondered,
watching
their
exchange
in
a
daze.
National
security?
Langdon
was
sensing
that
his
own
urgent
goal
of
finding
Peter
was
not
Sato's.
The
OS
director
seemed
to
be
on
another
page
entirely.
Anderson
looked
puzzled
as
well.
"National
security?
With
all
due
respect,
ma'am
"The
last
I
checked,"
she
interrupted,
"I
outrank
you.
I
suggest
you
do
exactly
as
I
say,
and
that
you
do
it
without
question."
Anderson
nodded
and
swallowed
hard.
"But
shouldn't
we
at
least
print
the
fingers
to
confirm
the
hand
belongs
to
Peter
Solomon?"
"I'll
confirm
it,"
Langdon
said,
feeling
a
sickening
certainty.
"I
recognize
his
ring
and
his
hand."
He
paused.
"The
tattoos
are
new,
though.
Someone
did
that
to
him
recently."
"I'm
sorry?"
Sato
looked
unnerved
for
the
first
time
since
arriving.
"The
hand
is
tattooedV
Langdon
nodded.
"The
thumb
has
a
crown.
And
the
index
finger
a
star."
Sato
pulled
out
a
pair
of
glasses
and
walked
toward
the
hand,
circling
like
a
shark.
"Also,"
Langdon
said,
"although
you
can't
see
the
other
three
fingers,
I'm
certain
they
will
have
tattoos
on
the
fingertips
as
well."
Sato
looked
intrigued
by
the
comment
and
motioned
to
Anderson.
"Chief,
can
you
look
at
the
other
fingertips
for
us,
please?"
Anderson
crouched
down
beside
the
hand,
being
careful
not
to
touch
it.
He
put
his
cheek
near
the
floor
and
looked
up
under
the
clenched
fingertips.
"He's
right,
ma'am.
All
of
the
fingertips
have
tattoos,
although
I
can't
quite
see
what
the
other
"A
sun,
a
lantern,
and
a
key,"
Langdon
said
flatly.
Sato
turned
fully
to
Langdon
now,
her
small
eyes
appraising
him.
"And
how
exactly
would
you
know
that?"
Langdon
stared
back.
"The
image
of
a
human
hand,
marked
in
this
way
on
the
fingertips,
is
a
very
old
icon.
It's
known
as
'the
Hand
of
the
Mysteries.'
Anderson
stood
up
abruptly.
"This
thing
has
a
nameT
Langdon
nodded.
"It's
one
of
the
most
secretive
icons
of
the
ancient
world."
Sato
cocked
her
head.
"Then
might
I
ask
what
the
hell
it's
doing
in
the
middle
of
the
U.S.
Capitol?"
Langdon
wished
he
would
wake
up
from
this
nightmare.
"Traditionally,
ma'am,
it
was
used
as
an
invitation."
"An
invitation
to
what?"
she
demanded.
Langdon
looked
down
at
the
symbols
on
his
friend's
severed
hand.
"For
centuries,
the
Hand
of
the
Mysteries
served
as
a
mystical
summons.
Basically,
it's
an
invitation
to
receive
secret
knowledge
protected
wisdom
known
only
to
an
elite
few."
Sato
folded
her
thin
arms
and
stared
up
at
him
with
jet-black
eyes.
"Well,
Professor,
for
someone
who
claims
to
have
no
clue
why
he's
here
you're
doing
quite
well
so
far."
Katherine
Solomon
donned
her
white
lab
coat
and
began
her
usual
arrival
routine
her
"rounds"
as
her
brother
called
them.
Like
a
nervous
parent
checking
on
a
sleeping
baby,
Katherine
poked
her
head
into
the
mechanical
room.
The
hydrogen
fuel
cell
was
running
smoothly,
its
backup
tanks
all
safely
nestled
in
their
racks.
Katherine
continued
down
the
hall
to
the
data-storage
room.
As
always,
the
two
redundant
holographic
backup
units
hummed
safely
within
their
temperature-controlled
vault.
All
of
my
research,
she
thought,
gazing
in
through
the
three-inch-thick
shatterproof
glass.
Holographic
data-
storage
devices,
unlike
their
refrigerator-
size
ancestors,
looked
more
like
sleek
stereo
components,
each
perched
atop
a
columnar
pedestal.
Both
of
her
lab's
holographic
drives
were
synchronized
and
identical
serving
as
redundant
backups
to
safeguard
identical
copies
of
her
work.
Most
backup
protocols
advocated
a
secondary
backup
system
off-site
in
case
of
earthquake,
fire,
or
theft,
but
Katherine
and
her
brother
agreed
that
secrecy
was
paramount;
once
this
data
left
the
building
to
an
off-site
server,
they
could
no
longer
be
certain
it
would
stay
private.
Content
that
everything
was
running
smoothly
here,
she
headed
back
down
the
hallway.
As
she
rounded
the
corner,
however,
she
spotted
something
unexpected
across
the
lab.
What
in
the
world?
A
muted
glow
was
glinting
off
all
the
equipment.
She
hurried
in
to
have
a
look,
surprised
to
see
light
emanating
from
behind
the
Plexiglas
wall
of
the
control
room.
He's
here.
Katherine
flew
across
the
lab,
arriving
at
the
control-room
door
and
heaving
it
open.
"Peter!"
she
said,
running
in.
The
plump
woman
seated
at
the
control
room's
terminal
jumped
up.
"Oh
my
God!
Katherine!
You
scared
me!"
Trish
Dunne
the
only
other
person
on
earth
allowed
back
here
was
Katherine'
s
metasy
stems
analyst
and
seldom
worked
weekends.
The
twenty-six-year-old
redhead
was
a
genius
data
modeler
and
had
signed
a
nondisclosure
document
worthy
of
the
KGB.
Tonight,
she
was
apparently
analyzing
data
on
the
control
room's
plasma
wall
a
huge
flat-screen
display
that
looked
like
something
out
of
NASA
mission
control.
"Sorry,"
Trish
said.
"I
didn't
know
you
were
here
yet.
I
was
trying
to
finish
up
before
you
and
your
brother
arrived."
"Have
you
spoken
to
him?
He's
late
and
he's
not
answering
his
phone."
Trish
shook
her
head.
"I
bet
he's
still
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
use
that
new
iPhone
you
gave
him."
Katherine
appreciated
Trish'
s
good
humor,
and
Trish'
s
presence
here
had
just
given
her
an
idea.
"Actually,
I'm
glad
you're
in
tonight.
You
might
be
able
to
help
me
with
something,
if
you
don't
mind?"
"Whatever
it
is,
I'm
sure
it
beats
football."
Katherine
took
a
deep
breath,
calming
her
mind.
"I'm
not
sure
how
to
explain
this,
but
earlier
today,
I
heard
an
unusual
story"
Trish
Dunne
didn't
know
what
story
Katherine
Solomon
had
heard,
but
clearly
it
had
her
on
edge.
Her
boss's
usually
calm
gray
eyes
looked
anxious,
and
she
had
tucked
her
hair
behind
her
ears
three
times
since
entering
the
room
a
nervous
"tell,as
Trish
called
it.
Brilliant
scientist.
Lousy
poker
player.
"To
me,"
Katherine
said,
"this
story
sounds
like
fiction
an
old
legend.
And
yet"
She
paused,
tucking
a
wisp
of
hair
behind
her
ears
once
again.
"And
yet?"
Katherine
sighed.
"And
yet
I
was
told
today
by
a
trusted
source
that
the
legend
is
true."
"Okay"
Where
is
she
going
with
this?
"I'm
going
to
talk
to
my
brother
about
it,
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
maybe
you
can
help
me
shed
some
light
on
it
before
I
do.
I'd
love
to
know
if
this
legend
has
ever
been
corroborated
anywhere
else
in
history."
"In
all
of
history?"
Katherine
nodded.
"Anywhere
in
the
world,
in
any
language,
at
any
point
in
history."
Strange
request,
Trish
thought,
but
certainly
feasible.
Ten
years
ago,
the
task
would
have
been
impossible.
Today,
however,
with
the
Internet,
the
World
Wide
Web,
and
the
ongoing
digitization
of
the
great
libraries
and
museums
in
the
world,
Katherine'
s
goal
could
be
achieved
by
using
a
relatively
simple
search
engine
equipped
with
an
army
of
translation
modules
and
some
well-chosen
keywords.
"No
problem,"
Trish
said.
Many
of
the
lab's
research
books
contained
passages
in
ancient
languages,
and
so
Trish
was
often
asked
to
write
specialized
Optical
Character
Recognition
translation
modules
to
generate
English
text
from
obscure
languages.
She
had
to
be
the
only
metasystems
specialist
on
earth
who
had
built
OCR
translation
modules
in
Old
Frisian,
Maek,
and
Akkadian.
The
modules
would
help,
but
the
trick
to
building
an
effective
search
spider
was
all
in
choosing
the
right
key
words.
Unique
but
not
overly
restrictive.
Katherine
looked
to
be
a
step
ahead
of
Trish
and
was
already
jotting
down
possible
keywords
on
a
slip
of
paper.
Katherine
had
written
down
several
when
she
paused,
thought
a
moment,
and
then
wrote
several
more.
"Okay,"
she
finally
said,
handing
Trish
the
slip
of
paper.
Trish
perused
the
list
of
search
strings,
and
her
eyes
grew
wide.
What
kind
of
crazy
legend
is
Katherine
investigating?
"You
want
me
to
search
for
all
of
these
key
phrases?"
One
of
the
words
Trish
didn't
even
recognize.
Is
that
even
English?
"Do
you
really
think
we'll
find
all
of
these
in
one
place?
Verbatim?"
"I'd
like
to
try."
Trish
would
have
said
impossible,
but
the
I-word
was
banned
here.
Katherine
considered
it
a
dangerous
mind-set
in
a
field
that
often
transformed
preconceived
falsehoods
into
confirmed
truths.
Trish
Dunne
seriously
doubted
this
key-phrase
search
would
fall
into
that
category.
"How
long
for
results?"
Katherine
asked.
"A
few
minutes
to
write
the
spider
and
launch
it.
After
that,
maybe
fifteen
for
the
spider
to
exhaust
itself."
"So
fast?"
Katherine
looked
encouraged.
Trish
nodded.
Traditional
search
engines
often
required
a
full
day
to
crawl
across
the
entire
online
universe,
find
new
documents,
digest
their
content,
and
add
it
to
their
searchable
database.
But
this
was
not
the
kind
of
search
spider
Trish
would
write.
"I'll
write
a
program
called
a
delegator,^
Trish
explained.
"It's
not
entirely
kosher,
but
it's
fast.
Essentially,
it's
a
program
that
orders
other
people's
search
engines
to
do
our
work.
Most
databases
have
a
search
function
built
in
libraries,
museums,
universities,
governments.
So
I
write
a
spider
that
finds
their
search
engines,
inputs
your
keywords,
and
asks
them
to
search.
This
way,
we
harness
the
power
of
thousands
of
engines,
working
in
unison."
Katherine
looked
impressed.
"Parallel
processing."
A
kind
of
metasystem.
"I'll
call
you
if
I
get
anything."
"I
appreciate
it,Trish."
Katherine
patted
her
on
the
back
and
headed
for
the
door.
"I'll
be
in
the
library."
Trish
settled
in
to
write
the
program.
Coding
a
search
spider
was
a
menial
task
far
below
her
skill
level,
but
Trish
Dunne
didn't
care.
She
would
do
anything
for
Katherine
Solomon.
Sometimes
Trish
still
couldn't
believe
the
good
fortune
that
had
brought
her
here.
You
've
come
a
long
way,
baby.
Just
over
a
year
ago,
Trish
had
quit
her
job
as
a
metasystems
analyst
in
one
of
the
high-tech
industry's
many
cubicle
farms.
In
her
off-hours,
she
did
some
freelance
programming
and
started
an
industry
blog
"Future
Applications
in
Computational
Metasystem
Analysis"
although
she
doubted
anyone
read
it.
Then
one
evening
her
phone
rang.
"Trish
Dunne?"
a
woman's
voice
asked
politely.
"Yes,
who's
calling,
please?"
"My
name
is
Katherine
Solomon."
Trish
almost
fainted
on
the
spot.
Katherine
Solomon?
"I
just
read
your
book
Noetic
Science:
Modern
Gateway
to
Ancient
Wisdom
and
I
wrote
about
it
on
my
blog!"
"Yes,
I
know,"
the
woman
replied
graciously.
"That's
why
I'm
calling."
Of
course
it
is,
Trish
realized,
feeling
dumb.
Even
brilliant
scientists
Google
themselves.
"Your
blog
intrigues
me,"
Katherine
told
her.
"I
wasn't
aware
metasystems
modeling
had
come
so
far."
"Yes,
ma'am,"
Trish
managed,
starstruck.
"Data
models
are
an
exploding
technology
with
far-reaching
applications."
For
several
minutes,
the
two
women
chatted
about
Trish'
s
work
in
metasystems,
discussing
her
experience
analyzing,
modeling,
and
predicting
the
flow
of
massive
data
fields.
"Obviously,
your
book
is
way
over
my
head,"
Trish
said,
"but
I
understood
enough
to
see
an
intersection
with
my
metasystems
work."
"Your
blog
said
you
believe
metasystems
modeling
can
transform
the
study
of
Noetics?"
"Absolutely.
I
believe
metasystems
could
turn
Noetics
into
real
science."
"Real
science?"
Katherine'
s
tone
hardened
slightly.
"As
opposed
to
?"
Oh
shit,
that
came
out
wrong.
"Urn,
what
I
meant
is
that
Noetics
is
more
esoteric."
Katherine
laughed.
"Relax,
I'm
kidding.
I
get
that
all
the
time."
I'm
not
surprised,
Trish
thought
Even
the
Institute
of
Noetic
Sciences
in
California
described
the
field
in
arcane
and
abstruse
language,
defining
it
as
the
study
of
mankind's
"direct
and
immediate
access
to
knowledge
beyond
what
is
available
to
our
normal
senses
and
the
power
of
reason."
The
word
noetic,
Trish
had
learned,
derived
from
the
ancient
Greek
nous
translating
roughly
to
"inner
knowledge"
or
"intuitive
consciousness."
"I'm
interested
in
your
metasystems
work,"
Katherine
said,
"and
how
it
might
relate
to
a
project
I'm
working
on.
Any
chance
you'd
be
willing
to
meet?
I'd
love
to
pick
your
brain."
Katherine
Solomon
wants
to
pick
my
brain?
It
felt
like
Maria
Sharapova
had
called
for
tennis
tips.
The
next
day
a
white
Volvo
pulled
into
Trish's
driveway
and
an
attractive,
willowy
woman
in
blue
jeans
got
out.
Trish
immediately
felt
two
feet
tall.
Great,
she
groaned.
Smart,
rich,
and
thin
and
I'm
supposed
to
believe
God
is
good?
But
Katherine'
s
unassuming
air
set
Trish
instantly
at
ease.
The
two
of
them
settled
in
on
Trish's
huge
back
porch
overlooking
an
impressive
piece
of
property.
"Your
house
is
amazing,"
Katherine
said.
"Thanks.
I
got
lucky
in
college
and
licensed
some
software
I'd
written."
"Metasystems
stuff?"
"A
precursor
to
metasystems.
Following
9/11,
the
government
was
intercepting
and
crunching
enormous
data
fields
civilian
e-mail,
cell
phone,
fax,
text,
Web
sites
sniffing
for
keywords
associated
with
terrorist
communications.
So
I
wrote
a
piece
of
software
that
let
them
process
their
data
field
in
a
second
way
pulling
from
it
an
additional
intelligence
product."
She
smiled.
"Essentially,
my
software
let
them
take
America's
temperature."
"I'm
sorry?"
Trish
laughed.
"Yeah,
sounds
crazy,
I
know.
What
I
mean
is
that
it
quantified
the
nation's
emotional
state.
It
offered
a
kind
of
cosmic
consciousness
barometer,
if
you
will."
Trish
explained
how,
using
a
data
field
of
the
nation's
communications,
one
could
assess
the
nation's
mood
based
on
the
"occurrence
density"
of
certain
keywords
and
emotional
indicators
in
the
data
field.
Happier
times
had
happier
language,
and
stressful
times
vice
versa.
In
the
event,
for
example,
of
a
terrorist
attack,
the
government
could
use
data
fields
to
measure
the
shift
in
America's
psyche
and
better
advise
the
president
on
the
emotional
impact
of
the
event.
"Fascinating,"
Katherine
said,
stroking
her
chin.
"So
essentially
you're
examining
a
population
of
individuals
as
if
it
were
a
single
organism."
"Exactly.
A
metasystem.
A
single
entity
defined
by
the
sum
of
its
parts.
The
human
body,
for
example,
consists
of
millions
of
individual
cells,
each
with
different
attributes
and
different
purposes,
but
it
functions
as
a
single
entity."
Katherine
nodded
enthusiastically.
"Like
a
flock
of
birds
or
a
school
of
fish
moving
as
one.
We
call
it
convergence
or
entanglement."
Trish
sensed
her
famous
guest
was
starting
to
see
the
potential
of
metasystem
programming
in
her
own
field
of
Noetics.
"My
software,"
Trish
explained,
"was
designed
to
help
government
agencies
better
evaluate
and
respond
appropriately
to
wide-scale
crises
pandemic
diseases,
national
tragedies,
terrorism,
that
sort
of
thing."
She
paused.
"Of
course,
there's
always
the
potential
that
it
could
be
used
in
other
directions
perhaps
to
take
a
snapshot
of
the
national
mind-set
and
predict
the
outcome
of
a
national
election
or
the
direction
the
stock
market
will
move
at
the
opening
bell."
"Sounds
powerful."
Trish
motioned
to
her
big
house.
"The
government
thought
so."
Katherine'
s
gray
eyes
focused
in
on
her
now.
"Trish,
might
I
ask
about
the
ethical
dilemma
posed
by
your
work?"
"What
do
you
mean?"
"I
mean
you
created
a
piece
of
software
that
can
easily
be
abused.
Those
who
possess
it
have
access
to
powerful
information
not
available
to
everyone.
You
didn't
feel
any
hesitation
creating
it?"
Trish
didn't
blink.
"Absolutely
not.
My
software
is
no
different
than
say
a
flight
simulator
program.
Some
users
will
practice
flying
first-aid
missions
into
underdeveloped
countries.
Some
users
will
practice
flying
passenger
jets
into
skyscrapers.
Knowledge
is
a
tool,
and
like
all
tools,
its
impact
is
in
the
hands
of
the
user."
Katherine
sat
back,
looking
impressed.
"So
let
me
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question."
Trish
suddenly
sensed
their
conversation
had
just
turned
into
a
job
interview.
Katherine
reached
down
and
picked
up
a
tiny
speck
of
sand
off
the
deck,
holding
it
up
for
Trish
to
see.
"It
occurs
to
me,"
she
said,
"that
your
metasystems
work
essentially
lets
you
calculate
the
weight
of
an
entire
sandy
beach
by
weighing
one
grain
at
a
time."
"Yes,
basically
that's
right."
"As
you
know,
this
little
grain
of
sand
has
mass.
A
very
small
mass,
but
mass
nonetheless."
Trish
nodded.
"And
because
this
grain
of
sand
has
mass,
it
therefore
exerts
gravity.
Again,
too
small
to
feel,
but
there."
"Right."
"Now,"
Katherine
said,
"if
we
take
trillions
of
these
sand
grains
and
let
them
attract
one
another
to
form
say,
the
moon,
then
their
combined
gravity
is
enough
to
move
entire
oceans
and
drag
the
tides
back
and
forth
across
our
planet."
Trish
had
no
idea
where
this
was
headed,
but
she
liked
what
she
was
hearing.
"So
let's
take
a
hypothetical,"
Katherine
said,
discarding
the
sand
grain.
"What
if
I
told
you
that
a
thought
.
.
.
any
tiny
idea
that
forms
in
your
mind
actually
has
massl
What
if
I
told
you
that
a
thought
is
an
actual
thing,
a
measurable
entity,
with
a
measurable
mass?
A
minuscule
mass,
of
course,
but
mass
nonetheless.
What
are
the
implications?"
"Hypothetically
speaking?
Well,
the
obvious
implications
are
if
a
thought
has
mass,
then
a
thought
exerts
gravity
and
can
pull
things
toward
it."
Katherine
smiled.
"You're
good.
Now
take
it
a
step
further.
What
happens
if
many
people
start
focusing
on
the
same
thought?
All
the
occurrences
of
that
same
thought
begin
to
merge
into
one,
and
the
cumulative
mass
of
this
thought
begins
to
grow.
And
therefore,
its
gravity
grows."
"Okay."
"Meaning
if
enough
people
begin
thinking
the
same
thing,
then
the
gravitational
force
of
that
thought
becomes
tangible
and
it
exerts
actual
force."
Katherine
winked.
"And
it
can
have
a
measurable
effect
in
our
physical
world."
Director
Inoue
Sato
stood
with
her
arms
folded,
her
eyes
locked
skeptically
on
Langdon
as
she
processed
what
he
had
just
told
her.
"He
said
he
wants
you
to
unlock
an
ancient
portal?
What
am
I
supposed
to
do
with
that,
Professor?"
Langdon
shrugged
weakly.
He
was
feeling
ill
again
and
tried
not
to
look
down
at
his
friend's
severed
hand.
"That's
exactly
what
he
told
me.
An
ancient
portal
hidden
somewhere
in
this
building.
I
told
him
I
knew
of
no
portal."
"Then
why
does
he
think
you
can
find
it?"
"Obviously,
he's
insane."
He
said
Peter
would
point
the
way.
Langdon
looked
down
at
Peter's
upstretched
finger,
again
feeling
repulsed
by
his
captor's
sadistic
play
on
words.
Peter
will
point
the
way.
Langdon
had
already
permitted
his
eyes
to
follow
the
pointing
finger
up
to
the
dome
overhead.
A
portal?
Up
there?
Insane.
"This
man
who
called
me,"
Langdon
told
Sato,
"was
the
only
one
who
knew
I
was
coming
to
the
Capitol
tonight,
so
whoever
informed
you
I
was
here
tonight,
that's
your
man.
I
recommend
"Where
I
got
my
information
is
not
your
concern,"
Sato
interrupted,
voice
sharpening.
"My
top
priority
at
the
moment
is
to
cooperate
with
this
man,
and
I
have
information
suggesting
you
are
the
only
one
who
can
give
him
what
he
wants."
"And
my
top
priority
is
to
find
my
friend,"
Langdon
replied,
frustrated.
Sato
inhaled
deeply,
her
patience
clearly
being
tested.
"If
we
want
to
find
Mr.
Solomon,
we
have
one
course
of
action,
Professor
to
start
cooperating
with
the
one
person
who
seems
to
know
where
he
is."
Sato
checked
her
watch.
"Our
time
is
limited.
I
can
assure
you
it
is
imperative
we
comply
with
this
man's
demands
quickly."
"How?"
Langdon
asked,
incredulous.
"By
locating
and
unlocking
an
ancient
portal?
There
is
no
portal,
Director
Sato.
This
guy's
a
lunatic."
Sato
stepped
close,
less
than
a
foot
from
Langdon.
"If
I
may
point
this
out
your
lunatic
deftly
manipulated
two
fairly
smart
individuals
already
this
morning."
She
stared
directly
at
Langdon
and
then
glanced
at
Anderson.
"In
my
business,
one
learns
there
is
a
fine
line
between
insanity
and
genius.
We
would
be
wise
to
give
this
man
a
little
respect."
"He
cut
off
a.
man's
hand!"
"My
point
exactly.
That
is
hardly
the
act
of
an
uncommitted
or
uncertain
individual.
More
important,
Professor,
this
man
obviously
believes
you
can
help
him.
He
brought
you
all
the
way
to
Washington
and
he
must
have
done
it
for
a
reason."
"He
said
the
only
reason
he
thinks
I
can
unlock
this
'portal'
is
that
Peter
told
him
I
can
unlock
it,"
Langdon
countered.
"And
why
would
Peter
Solomon
say
that
if
it
weren't
true?"
"I'm
sure
Peter
said
no
such
thing.
And
if
he
did,
then
he
did
so
under
duress.
He
was
confused
or
frightened."
"Yes.
It's
called
interrogational
torture,
and
it's
quite
effective.
All
the
more
reason
Mr.
Solomon
would
tell
the
truth."
Sato
spoke
as
if
she'd
had
personal
experience
with
this
technique.
"Did
he
explain
why
Peter
thinks
you
alone
can
unlock
the
portal?"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"Professor,
if
your
reputations
are
correct,
then
you
and
Peter
Solomon
both
share
an
interest
in
this
sort
of
thing
secrets,
historical
esoterica,
mysticism,
and
so
on.
In
all
of
your
discussions
with
Peter,
he
never
once
mentioned
to
you
anything
about
a
secret
portal
in
Washington,
D.C.?"
Langdon
could
scarcely
believe
he
was
being
asked
this
question
by
a
high-ranking
officer
of
the
CIA.
"I'm
certain
of
it.
Peter
and
I
talk
about
some
pretty
arcane
things,
but
believe
me,
I'd
tell
him
to
get
his
head
examined
if
he
ever
told
me
there
was
an
ancient
portal
hidden
anywhere
at
all.
Particularly
one
that
leads
to
the
Ancient
Mysteries."
She
glanced
up.
"I'm
sorry?
The
man
told
you
specifically
what
this
portal
leads
to?"
"Yes,
but
he
didn't
have
to."
Langdon
motioned
to
the
hand.
"The
Hand
of
the
Mysteries
is
a
formal
invitation
to
pass
through
a
mystical
gateway
and
acquire
ancient
secret
knowledge
powerful
wisdom
known
as
the
Ancient
Mysteries
or
the
lost
wisdom
of
all
the
ages."
"So
you've
heard
of
the
secret
he
believes
is
hidden
here."
"A
lot
of
historians
have
heard
of
it."
"Then
how
can
you
say
the
portal
does
not
exist?"
"With
respect,
ma'am,
we've
all
heard
of
the
Fountain
of
Youth
and
Shangri-la,
but
that
does
not
mean
they
exist."
The
loud
squawk
of
Anderson's
radio
interrupted
them.
"Chief?"
the
voice
on
the
radio
said.
Anderson
snatched
his
radio
from
his
belt.
"Anderson
here."
"Sir,
we've
completed
a
search
of
the
grounds.
There's
no
one
here
that
fits
the
description.
Any
further
orders,
sir?"
Anderson
shot
a
quick
glance
at
Sato,
clearly
expecting
a
reprimand,
but
Director
Sato
seemed
uninterested.
Anderson
moved
away
from
Langdon
and
Sato,
speaking
quietly
into
his
radio.
Sato's
unwavering
focus
remained
on
Langdon.
"You're
saying
the
secret
he
believes
is
hidden
in
Washington
is
a.
fantasy!"
Langdon
nodded.
"A
very
old
myth.
The
secret
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries
is
pre-Christian,
actually.
Thousands
of
years
old."
"And
yet
it's
still
around?"
"As
are
many
equally
improbable
beliefs."
Langdon
often
reminded
his
students
that
most
modern
religions
included
stories
that
did
not
hold
up
to
scientific
scrutiny:
everything
from
Moses
parting
the
Red
Sea
to
Joseph
Smith
using
magic
eyeglasses
to
translate
the
Book
of
Mormon
from
a
series
of
gold
plates
he
found
buried
in
upstate
New
York.
Wide
acceptance
of
an
idea
is
not
proof
of
its
validity.
"I
see.
So
what
exactly
are
these
Ancient
Mysteries?"
Langdon
exhaled.
Have
you
got
a
few
weeks?
"In
short,
the
Ancient
Mysteries
refer
to
a
body
of
secret
knowledge
that
was
amassed
long
ago.
One
intriguing
aspect
of
this
knowledge
is
that
it
allegedly
enables
its
practitioners
to
access
powerful
abilities
that
lie
dormant
in
the
human
mind.
The
enlightened
Adepts
who
possessed
this
knowledge
vowed
to
keep
it
veiled
from
the
masses
because
it
was
considered
far
too
potent
and
dangerous
for
the
uninitiated."
"Dangerous
in
what
way?"
"The
information
was
kept
hidden
for
the
same
reason
we
keep
matches
from
children.
In
the
correct
hands,
fire
can
provide
illumination
but
in
the
wrong
hands,
fire
can
be
highly
destructive."
Sato
took
off
her
glasses
and
studied
him.
"Tell
me,
Professor,
do
you
believe
such
powerful
information
could
truly
exist?"
Langdon
was
not
sure
how
to
respond.
The
Ancient
Mysteries
had
always
been
the
greatest
paradox
of
his
academic
career.
Virtually
every
mystical
tradition
on
earth
revolved
around
the
idea
that
there
existed
arcane
knowledge
capable
of
imbuing
humans
with
mystical,
almost
godlike,
powers:
tarot
and
/
Ching
gave
men
the
ability
to
see
the
future;
alchemy
gave
men
immortality
through
the
fabled
Philosopher's
Stone;
Wicca
permitted
advanced
practitioners
to
cast
powerful
spells.
The
list
went
on
and
on.
As
an
academic,
Langdon
could
not
deny
the
historical
record
of
these
traditions
troves
of
documents,
artifacts,
and
artwork
that,
indeed,
clearly
suggested
the
ancients
had
a
powerful
wisdom
that
they
shared
only
through
allegory,
myths,
and
symbols,
ensuring
that
only
those
properly
initiated
could
access
its
power.
Nonetheless,
as
a
realist
and
a
skeptic,
Langdon
remained
unconvinced.
"Let's
just
say
I'm
a
skeptic,"
he
told
Sato.
"I
have
never
seen
anything
in
the
real
world
to
suggest
the
Ancient
Mysteries
are
anything
other
than
legend
a
recurring
mythological
archetype.
It
seems
to
me
that
if
it
were
possible
for
humans
to
acquire
miraculous
powers,
there
would
be
evidence.
And
yet,
so
far,
history
has
given
us
no
men
with
superhuman
powers."
Sato
arched
her
eyebrows.
"That's
not
entirely
true."
Langdon
hesitated,
realizing
that
for
many
religious
people,
there
was
indeed
a
precedent
for
human
gods,
Jesus
being
the
most
obvious.
"Admittedly,"
he
said,
"there
are
plenty
of
educated
people
who
believe
this
empowering
wisdom
truly
exists,
but
I'm
not
yet
convinced."
"Is
Peter
Solomon
one
of
those
people?"
Sato
asked,
glancing
toward
the
hand
on
the
floor.
Langdon
could
not
bring
himself
to
look
at
the
hand.
"Peter
comes
from
a
family
lineage
that
has
always
had
a
passion
for
all
things
ancient
and
mystical."
"Was
that
a
yes?"
Sato
asked.
"I
can
assure
you
that
even
if
Peter
believes
the
Ancient
Mysteries
are
real,
he
does
not
believe
they
are
accessible
through
some
kind
of
portal
hidden
in
Washington,
D.C.
He
understands
metaphorical
symbolism,
which
is
something
his
captor
apparently
does
not."
Sato
nodded.
"So
you
believe
this
portal
is
a
metaphor."
"Of
course,"
Langdon
said.
"In
theory,
anyway.
It's
a
very
common
metaphor
a
mystical
portal
through
which
one
must
travel
to
become
enlightened.
Portals
and
doorways
are
common
symbolic
constructs
that
represent
transformative
rites
of
passage.
To
look
for
a
literal
portal
would
be
like
trying
to
locate
the
actual
Gates
of
Heaven."
Sato
seemed
to
consider
this
momentarily.
"But
it
sounds
like
Mr.
Solomon's
captor
believes
you
can
unlock
an
actual
portal."
Langdon
exhaled.
"He's
made
the
same
error
many
zealots
make
confusing
metaphor
with
a
literal
reality."
Similarly,
early
alchemists
had
toiled
in
vain
to
transform
lead
into
gold,
never
realizing
that
lead-to-gold
was
nothing
but
a
metaphor
for
tapping
into
true
human
potential
that
of
taking
a
dull,
ignorant
mind
and
transforming
it
into
a
bright,
enlightened
one.
Sato
motioned
to
the
hand.
"If
this
man
wants
you
to
locate
some
kind
of
portal
for
him,
why
wouldn't
he
simply
tell
you
how
to
find
it?
Why
all
the
dramatics?
Why
give
you
a
tattooed
hand?"
Langdon
had
asked
himself
the
same
question
and
the
answer
was
unsettling.
"Well,
it
seems
the
man
we
are
dealing
with,
in
addition
to
being
mentally
unstable,
is
also
highly
educated.
This
hand
is
proof
that
he
is
well
versed
in
the
Mysteries
as
well
as
their
codes
of
secrecy.
Not
to
mention
with
the
history
of
this
room."
"I
don't
understand."
"Everything
he
has
done
tonight
was
done
in
perfect
accordance
with
ancient
protocols.
Traditionally,
the
Hand
of
the
Mysteries
is
a
sacred
invitation,
and
therefore
it
must
be
presented
in
a
sacred
place."
Sato's
eyes
narrowed.
"This
is
the
Rotunda
of
the
U.S.
Capitol
Building,
Professor,
not
some
sacred
shrine
to
ancient
mystical
secrets."
"Actually,
ma'am,"
Langdon
said,
"I
know
a
great
number
of
historians
who
would
disagree
with
you."
At
that
moment,
across
town,
Trish
Dunne
was
seated
in
the
glow
of
the
plasma
wall
inside
the
Cube.
She
finished
preparing
her
search
spider
and
typed
in
the
five
key
phrases
Katherine
had
given
her.
Here
goes
nothing.
Feeling
little
optimism,
she
launched
the
spider,
effectively
commencing
a
worldwide
game
of
Go
Fish.
At
blinding
speed,
the
phrases
were
now
being
compared
to
texts
all
over
the
world
looking
for
a
perfect
match.
Trish
couldn't
help
but
wonder
what
this
was
all
about,
but
she
had
come
to
accept
that
working
with
the
Solomons
meant
never
quite
knowing
the
entire
story.
Robert
Langdon
stole
an
anxious
glance
at
his
wristwatch:
7:58
P.M.
The
smiling
face
of
Mickey
Mouse
did
little
to
cheer
him
up.
I've
got
to
find
Peter.
We're
wasting
time.
Sato
had
stepped
aside
for
a
moment
to
take
a
phone
call,
but
now
she
returned
to
Langdon.
"Professor,
am
I
keeping
you
from
something?"
"No,
ma'am,"
Langdon
said,
pulling
his
sleeve
down
over
his
watch.
"I'm
just
extremely
concerned
about
Peter."
"I
can
understand,
but
I
assure
you
the
best
thing
you
can
do
to
help
Peter
is
to
help
me
understand
the
mind-
set
of
his
captor."
Langdon
was
not
so
sure,
but
he
sensed
he
was
not
going
anywhere
until
the
OS
director
got
the
information
she
desired.
"A
moment
ago,"
Sato
said,
"you
suggested
this
Rotunda
is
somehow
sacred
to
the
idea
of
these
Ancient
Mysteries?"
"Yes,
ma'am."
"Explain
that
to
me."
Langdon
knew
he
would
have
to
choose
his
words
sparingly.
He
had
taught
for
entire
semesters
on
the
mystical
symbolism
of
Washington,
D.C.,
and
there
was
an
almost
inexhaustible
list
of
mystical
references
in
this
building
alone.
America
has
a
hidden
past.
Every
time
Langdon
lectured
on
the
symbology
of
America,
his
students
were
confounded
to
learn
that
the
true
intentions
of
our
nation's
forefathers
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
what
so
many
politicians
now
claimed.
America
's
intended
destiny
has
been
lost
to
history.
The
forefathers
who
founded
this
capital
city
first
named
her
"Rome."
They
had
named
her
river
the
Tiber
and
erected
a
classical
capital
of
pantheons
and
temples,
all
adorned
with
images
of
history's
great
gods
and
goddesses
Apollo,
Minerva,
Venus,
Helios,
Vulcan,
Jupiter.
In
her
center,
as
in
many
of
the
great
classical
cities,
the
founders
had
erected
an
enduring
tribute
to
the
ancients
the
Egyptian
obelisk.
This
obelisk,
larger
even
than
Cairo's
or
Alexandria's,
rose
555
feet
into
the
sky,
more
than
thirty
stories,
proclaiming
thanks
and
honor
to
the
demigod
forefather
for
whom
this
capital
city
took
its
newer
name.
Washington.
Now,
centuries
later,
despite
America's
separation
of
church
and
state,
this
state-
sponsored
Rotunda
glistened
with
ancient
religious
symbolism.
There
were
over
a
dozen
different
gods
in
the
Rotunda
more
than
the
original
Pantheon
in
Rome.
Of
course,
the
Roman
Pantheon
had
been
converted
to
Christianity
in
609
but
this
pantheon
was
never
converted;
vestiges
of
its
true
history
still
remained
in
plain
view.
"As
you
may
know,"
Langdon
said,
"this
Rotunda
was
designed
as
a
tribute
to
one
of
Rome's
most
venerated
mystical
shrines.
The
Temple
of
Vesta."
"As
in
the
vestal
virgins?"
Sato
looked
doubtful
that
Rome's
virginal
guardians
of
the
flame
had
anything
to
do
with
the
U.S.
Capitol
Building.
"The
Temple
of
Vesta
in
Rome,"
Langdon
said,
"was
circular,
with
a
gaping
hole
in
the
floor,
through
which
the
sacred
fire
of
enlightenment
could
be
tended
by
a
sisterhood
of
virgins
whose
job
it
was
to
ensure
the
flame
never
went
out."
Sato
shrugged.
"This
Rotunda
is
a
circle,
but
I
see
no
gaping
hole
in
this
floor."
"No,
not
anymore,
but
for
years
the
center
of
this
room
had
a
large
opening
precisely
where
Peter's
hand
is
now."
Langdon
motioned
to
the
floor.
"In
fact,
you
can
still
see
the
marks
in
the
floor
from
the
railing
that
kept
people
from
falling
in."
"What?"
Sato
demanded,
scrutinizing
the
floor.
"I've
never
heard
that."
"Looks
like
he's
right."
Anderson
pointed
out
the
circle
of
iron
nubs
where
the
posts
had
once
been.
"I've
seen
these
before,
but
I
never
had
any
idea
why
they
were
there."
You
're
not
alone,
Langdon
thought,
imagining
the
thousands
of
people
every
day,
including
famous
lawmakers,
who
strode
across
the
center
of
the
Rotunda
having
no
idea
there
was
once
a
day
when
they
would
have
plunged
down
into
the
Capitol
Crypt
the
level
beneath
the
Rotunda
floor.
"The
hole
in
the
floor,"
Langdon
told
them,
"was
eventually
covered,
but
for
a
good
while,
those
who
visited
the
Rotunda
could
see
straight
down
to
the
fire
that
burned
below."
Sato
turned.
"Fire?
In
the
U.S.
Capitol?"
"More
of
a
large
torch,
actually
an
eternal
flame
that
burned
in
the
crypt
directly
beneath
us.
It
was
supposed
to
be
visible
through
the
hole
in
the
floor,
making
this
room
a
modern
Temple
of
Vesta.
This
building
even
had
its
own
vestal
virgin
a
federal
employee
called
the
Keeper
of
the
Crypt
who
successfully
kept
the
flame
burning
for
fifty
years,
until
politics,
religion,
and
smoke
damage
snuffed
out
the
idea."
Both
Anderson
and
Sato
looked
surprised.
Nowadays,
the
only
reminder
that
a
flame
once
burned
here
was
the
four-pointed
star
compass
embedded
in
the
crypt
floor
one
story
below
them
a
symbol
of
America'
s
eternal
flame,
which
once
shed
illumination
toward
the
four
corners
of
the
New
World.
"So,
Professor,"
Sato
said,
"your
contention
is
that
the
man
who
left
Peter's
hand
here
knew
all
this?"
"Clearly.
And
much,
much
more.
There
are
symbols
all
over
this
room
that
reflect
a
belief
in
the
Ancient
Mysteries."
"Secret
wisdom,"
Sato
said
with
more
than
a
hint
of
sarcasm
in
her
voice.
"Knowledge
that
lets
men
acquire
godlike
powers?"
"Yes,
ma'am."
"That
hardly
fits
with
the
Christian
underpinnings
of
this
country."
"So
it
would
seem,
but
it's
true.
This
transformation
of
man
into
God
is
called
apotheosis.
Whether
or
not
you're
aware
of
it,
this
theme
transforming
man
into
god
is
the
core
element
in
this
Rotunda's
symbolism."
"Apotheosis?"
Anderson
spun
with
a
startled
look
of
recognition.
"Yes."
Anderson
works
here.
He
knows.
"The
word
apotheosis
literally
means
'divine
transformation'
that
of
man
becoming
God.
It's
from
the
ancient
Greek:
apo
'to
become,'
theos
'god.'
Anderson
looked
amazed.
"Apotheosis
means
'to
become
God'?
I
had
no
idea."
"What
am
I
missing?"
Sato
demanded.
"Ma'am,"
Langdon
said,
"the
largest
painting
in
this
building
is
called
The
Apotheosis
of
Washington.
And
it
clearly
depicts
George
Washington
being
transformed
into
a
god."
Sato
looked
doubtful.
"I've
never
seen
anything
of
the
sort."
"Actually,
I'm
sure
you
have."
Langdon
raised
his
index
finger,
pointing
straight
up.
"It's
directly
over
your
head."
The
Apotheosis
of
Washington
a
4,664-square-foot
fresco
that
covers
the
canopy
of
the
Capitol
Rotunda
was
completed
in
1865
by
Constantino
Brumidi.
Known
as
"The
Michelangelo
of
the
Capitol,"
Brumidi
had
laid
claim
to
the
Capitol
Rotunda
in
the
same
way
Michelangelo
had
laid
claim
to
the
Sistine
Chapel,
by
painting
a
fresco
on
the
room's
most
lofty
canvas
the
ceiling.
Like
Michelangelo,
Brumidi
had
done
some
of
his
finest
work
inside
the
Vatican.
Brumidi,
however,
immigrated
to
America
in
1852,
abandoning
God's
largest
shrine
in
favor
of
a
new
shrine,
the
U.S.
Capitol,
which
now
glistened
with
examples
of
his
mastery
from
the
trompe
l'oeil
of
the
Brumidi
Corridors
to
the
frieze
ceiling
of
the
Vice
President's
Room.
And
yet
it
was
the
enormous
image
hovering
above
the
Capitol
Rotunda
that
most
historians
considered
to
be
Brumidi's
masterwork.
Robert
Langdon
gazed
up
at
the
massive
fresco
that
covered
the
ceiling.
He
usually
enjoyed
his
students'
startled
reactions
to
this
fresco's
bizarre
imagery,
but
at
the
moment
he
simply
felt
trapped
in
a
nightmare
he
had
yet
to
understand.
Director
Sato
was
standing
next
to
him
with
her
hands
on
her
hips,
frowning
up
at
the
distant
ceiling.
Langdon
sensed
she
was
having
the
same
reaction
many
had
when
they
first
stopped
to
examine
the
painting
at
the
core
of
their
nation.
Utter
confusion.
You're
not
alone,
Langdon
thought.
For
most
people,
The
Apotheosis
of
Washington
got
stranger
and
stranger
the
longer
they
looked
at
it.
"That's
George
Washington
on
the
central
panel,"
Langdon
said,
pointing
180
feet
upward
into
the
middle
of
the
dome.
"As
you
can
see,
he's
dressed
in
white
robes,
attended
by
thirteen
maidens,
and
ascending
on
a
cloud
above
mortal
man.
This
is
the
moment
of
his
apotheosis
his
transformation
into
a
god."
Sato
and
Anderson
said
nothing.
"Nearby,"
Langdon
continued,
"you
can
see
a
strange,
anachronistic
series
of
figures:
ancient
gods
presenting
our
forefathers
with
advanced
knowledge.
There's
Minerva
giving
technological
inspiration
to
our
nation's
great
inventors
Ben
Franklin,
Robert
Fulton,
Samuel
Morse."
Langdon
pointed
them
out
one
by
one.
"And
over
there
is
Vulcan
helping
us
build
a
steam
engine.
Beside
them
is
Neptune
demonstrating
how
to
lay
the
transatlantic
cable.
Beside
that
is
Ceres,
goddess
of
grain
and
root
of
our
word
cereal;
she's
sitting
on
the
McCormick
reaper,
the
farming
breakthrough
that
enabled
this
country
to
become
a
world
leader
in
food
production.
The
painting
quite
overtly
portrays
our
forefathers
receiving
great
wisdom
from
the
gods."
He
lowered
his
head,
looking
at
Sato
now.
"Knowledge
is
power,
and
the
right
knowledge
lets
man
perform
miraculous,
almost
godlike
tasks."
Sato
dropped
her
gaze
back
down
to
Langdon
and
rubbed
her
neck.
"Laying
a
phone
cable
is
a
far
cry
from
being
a
god."
"Perhaps
to
a
modern
man,"
Langdon
replied.
"But
if
George
Washington
knew
that
we
had
become
a
race
that
possessed
the
power
to
speak
to
one
another
across
oceans,
fly
at
the
speed
of
sound,
and
set
foot
on
our
moon,
he
would
assume
that
we
had
become
gods,
capable
of
miraculous
tasks."
He
paused.
"In
the
words
of
futurist
Arthur
C.
Clarke,
'Any
sufficiently
advanced
technology
is
indistinguishable
from
magic'
Sato
pursed
her
lips,
apparently
deep
in
thought.
She
glanced
down
at
the
hand,
and
then
followed
the
direction
of
the
outstretched
index
finger
up
into
the
dome.
"Professor,
you
were
told,
'Peter
will
point
the
way.'
Is
that
correct?"
"Yes,
ma'am,
but"
"Chief,"
Sato
said,
turning
away
from
Langdon,
"can
you
get
us
a
closer
look
at
the
painting?"
Anderson
nodded.
"There's
a
catwalk
around
the
interior
of
the
dome."
Langdon
looked
way,
way
up
to
the
tiny
railing
visible
just
beneath
the
painting
and
felt
his
body
go
rigid.
"There's
no
need
to
go
up
there."
He
had
experienced
that
seldom-
visited
catwalk
once
before,
as
the
guest
of
a
U.S.
senator
and
his
wife,
and
he
had
almost
fainted
from
the
dizzying
height
and
perilous
walkway.
"No
need?"
Sato
demanded.
"Professor,
we
have
a
man
who
believes
this
room
contains
a
portal
that
has
the
potential
to
make
him
a
god;
we
have
a
ceiling
fresco
that
symbolizes
the
transformation
of
a
man
into
a
god;
and
we
have
a
hand
pointing
straight
at
that
painting.
It
seems
everything
is
urging
us
upward."
"Actually,"
Anderson
interjected,
glancing
up,
"not
many
people
know
this,
but
there
is
one
hexagonal
coffer
in
the
dome
that
actually
swings
open
like
a
portal,
and
you
can
peer
down
through
it
and
"Wait
a
second,"
Langdon
said,
"you're
missing
the
point.
The
portal
this
man
is
looking
for
is
a.
figurative
portal
a
gateway
that
doesn't
exist.
When
he
said,
'Peter
will
point
the
way,'
he
was
talking
in
metaphorical
terms.
This
pointing-hand
gesture
with
its
index
finger
and
thumb
extended
upward
is
a
well-known
symbol
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries,
and
it
appears
all
over
the
world
in
ancient
art.
This
same
gesture
appears
in
three
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci's
most
famous
encoded
masterpieces
The
Last
Supper,
Adoration
of
the
Magi,
and
Saint
John
the
Baptist.
It's
a
symbol
of
man's
mystical
connection
to
God."
As
above,
so
below.
The
madman's
bizarre
choice
of
words
was
starting
to
feel
more
relevant
now.
"I've
never
seen
it
before,"
Sato
said.
Then
watch
ESPN,
Langdon
thought,
always
amused
to
see
professional
athletes
point
skyward
in
gratitude
to
God
after
a
touchdown
or
home
run.
He
wondered
how
many
knew
they
were
continuing
a
pre-Christian
mystical
tradition
of
acknowledging
the
mystical
power
above,
which,
for
one
brief
moment,
had
transformed
them
into
a
god
capable
of
miraculous
feats.
"If
it's
of
any
help,"
Langdon
said,
"Peter's
hand
is
not
the
first
such
hand
to
make
an
appearance
in
this
Rotunda."
Sato
eyed
him
like
he
was
insane.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
Langdon
motioned
to
her
BlackBerry.
"Google
'George
Washington
Zeus.'
Sato
looked
uncertain
but
started
typing.
Anderson
inched
toward
her,
looking
over
her
shoulder
intently.
Langdon
said,
"This
Rotunda
was
once
dominated
by
a
massive
sculpture
of
a
bare-chested
George
Washington
depicted
as
a
god.
He
sat
in
the
same
exact
pose
as
Zeus
in
the
Pantheon,
bare
chest
exposed,
left
hand
holding
a
sword,
right
hand
raised
with
thumb
and
finger
extended."
Sato
had
apparently
found
an
online
image,
because
Anderson
was
staring
at
her
BlackBerry
in
shock.
"Hold
on,
that's
George
Washington?"
"Yes,"
Langdon
said.
"Depicted
as
Zeus."
"Look
at
his
hand,"
Anderson
said,
still
peering
over
Sato's
shoulder.
"His
right
hand
is
in
the
same
exact
position
as
Mr.
Solomon's."
As
I
said,
Langdon
thought,
Peter's
hand
is
not
the
first
to
make
an
appearance
in
this
room.
When
Horatio
Greenough's
statue
of
a
naked
George
Washington
was
first
unveiled
in
the
Rotunda,
many
joked
that
Washington
must
be
reaching
skyward
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
find
some
clothes.
As
American
religious
ideals
changed,
however,
the
joking
criticism
turned
to
controversy,
and
the
statue
was
removed,
banished
to
a
shed
in
the
east
garden.
Currently,
it
made
its
home
at
the
Smithsonian's
National
Museum
of
American
History,
where
those
who
saw
it
had
no
reason
to
suspect
that
it
was
one
of
the
last
vestigial
links
to
a
time
when
the
father
of
the
country
had
watched
over
the
U.S.
Capitol
as
a
god
like
Zeus
watching
over
the
Pantheon.
Sato
began
dialing
a
number
on
her
BlackBerry,
apparently
seeing
this
as
an
opportune
moment
to
check
in
with
her
staff.
"What
have
you
got?"
She
listened
patiently.
"I
see"
She
glanced
directly
at
Langdon,
then
at
Peter's
hand.
"You're
certain?"
She
listened
a
moment
longer.
"Okay,
thanks."
She
hung
up
and
turned
back
toward
Langdon.
"My
support
staff
did
some
research
and
confirms
the
existence
of
your
so-called
Hand
of
the
Mysteries,
corroborating
everything
you
said:
five
fingertip
markings
the
star,
the
sun,
the
key,
the
crown,
and
the
lantern
as
well
as
the
fact
that
this
hand
served
as
an
ancient
invitation
to
learn
secret
wisdom."
"I'm
glad,"
Langdon
said.
"Don't
be,"
she
replied
curtly.
"It
appears
we're
now
at
a
dead
end
until
you
share
whatever
it
is
you're
still
not
telling
me."
"Ma'am?"
Sato
stepped
toward
him.
"We've
come
full
circle,
Professor.
You've
told
me
nothing
I
could
not
have
learned
from
my
own
staff.
And
so
I
will
ask
you
once
more.
Why
were
you
brought
here
tonight?
What
makes
you
so
special?
What
is
it
that
you
alone
know?"
"We've
been
through
this,"
Langdon
fired
back.
"I
don't
know
why
this
guy
thinks
I
know
anything
at
all!"
Langdon
was
half
tempted
to
demand
how
the
hell
Sato
knew
that
he
was
in
the
Capitol
tonight,
but
they'd
been
through
that,
too.
Sato
isn't
talking.
"If
I
knew
the
next
step,"
he
told
her,
"I'd
tell
you.
But
I
don't.
Traditionally,
the
Hand
of
the
Mysteries
is
extended
by
a
teacher
to
a
student.
And
then,
shortly
afterward,
the
hand
is
followed
up
with
a
set
of
instructions
directions
to
a
temple,
the
name
of
the
master
who
will
teach
you
something!
But
all
this
guy
left
for
us
is
five
tattoos!
Hardly
Langdon
stopped
short.
Sato
eyed
him.
"What
is
it?"
Langdon'
s
eyes
shot
back
to
the
hand.
Five
tattoos.
He
now
realized
that
what
he
was
saying
might
not
be
entirely
true.
"Professor?"
Sato
pressed.
Langdon
inched
toward
the
gruesome
object.
Peter
will
point
the
way.
"Earlier,
it
crossed
my
mind
that
maybe
this
guy
had
left
an
object
clenched
in
Peter's
palm
a
map,
or
a
letter,
or
a
set
of
directions."
"He
didn't,"
Anderson
said.
"As
you
can
see,
those
three
fingers
are
not
clenched
tightly."
"You're
right,"
Langdon
said.
"But
it
occurs
to
me"
He
crouched
down
now,
trying
to
see
up
under
the
fingers
to
the
hidden
part
of
Peter's
palm.
"Maybe
it's
not
written
on
paper."
"Tattooed?"
Anderson
said.
Langdon
nodded.
"Do
you
see
anything
on
the
palm?"
Sato
asked.
Langdon
crouched
lower,
trying
to
peer
up
under
the
loosely
clenched
fingers.
"The
angle
is
impossible.
I
can't"
"Oh,
for
heaven's
sake,"
Sato
said,
moving
toward
him.
"Just
open
the
damned
thing!"
Anderson
stepped
in
front
of
her.
"Ma'am!
We
should
really
wait
for
forensics
before
we
touch
"I
want
some
answers,"
Sato
said,
pushing
past
him.
She
crouched
down,
edging
Langdon
away
from
the
hand.
Langdon
stood
up
and
watched
in
disbelief
as
Sato
pulled
a
pen
from
her
pocket,
sliding
it
carefully
under
the
three
clenched
fingers.
Then,
one
by
one,
she
pried
each
finger
upward
until
the
hand
stood
fully
open,
with
its
palm
visible.
She
glanced
up
at
Langdon,
and
a
thin
smile
spread
across
her
face.
"Right
again,
Professor."
Pacing
the
library,
Katherine
Solomon
pulled
back
the
sleeve
of
her
lab
coat
and
checked
her
watch.
She
was
not
a
woman
accustomed
to
waiting,
but
at
the
moment,
she
felt
as
if
her
whole
world
were
on
hold.
She
was
waiting
for
Trish's
search-spider
results,
she
was
waiting
for
word
from
her
brother,
and
also,
she
was
waiting
for
a
callback
from
the
man
who
was
responsible
for
this
entire
troubling
situation.
/
wish
he
hadn
't
told
me,
she
thought.
Normally,
Katherine
was
extremely
careful
about
making
new
acquaintances,
and
although
she
had
met
this
man
for
the
first
time
only
this
afternoon,
he
had
earned
her
trust
in
a
matter
of
minutes.
Completely.
His
call
had
come
this
afternoon
while
Katherine
was
at
home
enjoying
her
usual
Sunday-afternoon
pleasure
of
catching
up
on
the
week's
scientific
journals.
"Ms.
Solomon?"
an
unusually
airy
voice
had
said.
"My
name
is
Dr.
Christopher
Abaddon.
I
was
hoping
I
might
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
about
your
brother?"
"I'm
sorry,
who
is
this?"
she
had
demanded.
And
how
did
you
get
my
private
cell-phone
number?
"Dr.
Christopher
Abaddon?"
Katherine
did
not
recognize
the
name.
The
man
cleared
his
throat,
as
if
the
situation
had
just
become
awkward.
"I
apologize,
Ms.
Solomon.
I
was
under
the
impression
your
brother
had
told
you
about
me.
I'm
his
doctor.
Your
cell
number
was
listed
as
his
emergency
contact."
Katherine'
s
heart
skipped.
Emergency
contact?
"Is
something
wrong?"
"No
I
don't
think
so,"
the
man
said.
"Your
brother
missed
an
appointment
this
morning,
and
I
can't
reach
him
on
any
of
his
numbers.
He
never
misses
appointments
without
calling,
and
I'm
just
a
little
worried.
I
hesitated
to
phone
you,
but
"No,
no,
not
at
all,
I
appreciate
the
concern."
Katherine
was
still
trying
to
place
the
doctor's
name.
"I
haven't
spoken
to
my
brother
since
yesterday
morning,
but
he
probably
just
forgot
to
turn
on
his
cell."
Katherine
had
recently
given
him
a
new
iPhone,
and
he
still
hadn't
taken
the
time
to
figure
out
how
to
use
it.
"You
say
you're
his
doctor?"
she
asked.
Does
Peter
have
an
illness
he's
keeping
from
me?
There
was
a
weighty
pause
on
the
line.
"I'm
terribly
sorry,
but
I've
obviously
just
made
a
rather
serious
professional
error
by
calling
you.
Your
brother
told
me
you
were
aware
of
his
visits
to
me,
but
now
I
see
that's
not
the
case."
My
brother
lied
to
his
doctor?
Katherine'
s
concern
was
now
growing
steadily.
"Is
he
sick?"
"I'm
sorry,
Ms.
Solomon,
doctor-patient
confidentiality
precludes
me
from
discussing
your
brother's
condition,
and
I've
already
said
too
much
by
admitting
he
is
my
patient.
I'm
going
to
hang
up
now,
but
if
you
hear
from
him
today,
please
ask
him
to
call
me
so
I
know
he's
okay."
"Wait!"
Katherine
said.
"Please
tell
me
what's
wrong
with
Peter!"
Dr.
Abaddon
exhaled,
sounding
displeased
with
his
mistake.
"Ms.
Solomon,
I
can
hear
you're
upset,
and
I
don't
blame
you.
I'm
sure
your
brother
is
fine.
He
was
in
my
office
just
yesterday."
"Yesterday?
And
he's
scheduled
again
today?
This
sounds
urgent."
The
man
heaved
a
sigh.
"I
suggest
we
give
him
a
little
more
time
before
we
"I'm
coming
by
your
office
right
now,"
Katherine
said,
heading
for
the
door.
"Where
are
you
located?"
Silence.
"Dr.
Christopher
Abaddon?"
Katherine
said.
"I
can
look
up
your
address
myself,
or
you
can
simply
give
it
to
me.
Either
way,
I'm
coming
over."
The
doctor
paused.
"If
I
meet
with
you,
Ms.
Solomon,
would
you
please
do
me
the
courtesy
of
saying
nothing
to
your
brother
until
I've
had
a
chance
to
explain
my
misstep?"
"That's
fine."
"Thank
you.
My
office
is
in
Kalorama
Heights."
He
gave
her
an
address.
Twenty
minutes
later,
Katherine
Solomon
was
navigating
the
stately
streets
of
Kalorama
Heights.
She
had
phoned
all
of
her
brother's
numbers
with
no
reply.
She
did
not
feel
overly
concerned
about
her
brother's
whereabouts,
and
yet,
the
news
that
he
was
secretly
seeing
a
doctor
was
troubling.
When
Katherine
finally
located
the
address,
she
stared
up
at
the
building
in
confusion.
This
is
a
doctor's
office?
The
opulent
mansion
before
her
had
a
wrought-
iron
security
fence,
electronic
cameras,
and
lush
grounds.
As
she
slowed
to
double-check
the
address,
one
of
the
security
cameras
rotated
toward
her,
and
the
gate
swung
open.
Tentatively,
Katherine
drove
up
the
driveway
and
parked
next
to
a
six-car
garage
and
a
stretch
limo.
What
kind
of
doctor
is
this
guy?
As
she
got
out
of
her
car,
the
front
door
of
the
mansion
opened,
and
an
elegant
figure
drifted
out
onto
the
landing.
He
was
handsome,
exceptionally
tall,
and
younger
than
she
had
imagined.
Even
so,
he
projected
the
sophistication
and
polish
of
an
older
man.
He
was
impeccably
dressed
in
a
dark
suit
and
tie,
and
his
thick
blond
hair
was
immaculately
coiffed.
"Ms.
Solomon,
I'm
Dr.
Christopher
Abaddon,"
he
said,
his
voice
a
breathy
whisper.
When
they
shook
hands,
his
skin
felt
smooth
and
well
tended.
"Katherine
Solomon,"
she
said,
trying
not
to
stare
at
his
skin,
which
was
unusually
smooth
and
bronzed.
Is
he
wearing
makeup
?
Katherine
felt
a
growing
disquiet
as
she
stepped
into
the
home's
beautifully
appointed
foyer.
Classical
music
played
softly
in
the
background,
and
it
smelled
as
if
someone
had
burned
incense.
"This
is
lovely,"
she
said,
"although
I
expected
more
of
an
office."
"I'm
fortunate
to
work
out
of
my
home."
The
man
led
her
into
a
living
room,
where
there
was
a
crackling
fire.
"Please
make
yourself
comfortable.
I'm
just
steeping
some
tea.
I'll
bring
it
out,
and
we
can
talk."
He
strode
toward
the
kitchen
and
disappeared.
Katherine
Solomon
did
not
sit.
Female
intuition
was
a
potent
instinct
that
she
had
learned
to
trust,
and
something
about
this
place
was
making
her
skin
crawl.
She
saw
nothing
that
looked
anything
like
any
doctor's
office
she
had
ever
seen.
The
walls
of
this
antique-
adorned
living
room
were
covered
with
classical
art,
primarily
paintings
with
strange
mythical
themes.
She
paused
before
a
large
canvas
depicting
the
Three
Graces,
whose
nude
bodies
were
spectacularly
rendered
in
vivid
colors.
"That's
the
original
Michael
Parkes
oil."
Dr.
Abaddon
appeared
without
warning
beside
her,
holding
a
tray
of
steaming
tea.
"I
thought
we'd
sit
by
the
fire?"
He
led
her
over
to
the
living
room
and
offered
her
a
seat.
"There's
no
reason
to
be
nervous."
"I'm
not
nervous,"
Katherine
said
entirely
too
quickly.
He
gave
her
a
reassuring
smile.
"Actually,
it
is
my
business
to
know
when
people
are
nervous."
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"I'm
a
practicing
psychiatrist,
Ms.
Solomon.
That
is
my
profession.
I've
been
seeing
your
brother
for
almost
a
year
now.
I'm
his
therapist."
Katherine
could
only
stare.
My
brother
is
in
therapy?
"Patients
often
choose
to
keep
their
therapy
to
themselves,"
the
man
said.
"I
made
a
mistake
by
calling
you,
although
in
my
defense,
your
brother
did
mislead
me."
"I
I
had
no
idea."
"I
apologize
if
I
made
you
nervous,"
he
said,
sounding
embarrassed.
"I
noticed
you
studying
my
face
when
we
met,
and
yes,
I
do
wear
makeup."
He
touched
his
own
cheek,
looking
self-conscious.
"I
have
a
dermatological
condition,
which
I
prefer
to
hide.
My
wife
usually
puts
the
makeup
on
for
me,
but
when
she's
not
here,
I
have
to
rely
on
my
own
heavy
touch."
Katherine
nodded,
too
embarrassed
to
speak.
"And
this
lovely
hair"
He
touched
his
lush
blond
mane.
"A
wig.
My
skin
condition
affected
my
scalp
follicles
as
well,
and
all
my
hair
jumped
ship."
He
shrugged.
"I'm
afraid
my
one
sin
is
vanity."
"Apparently
mine
is
rudeness,"
Katherine
said.
"Not
at
all."
Dr.
Abaddon's
smile
was
disarming.
"Shall
we
start
over?
Perhaps
with
some
tea?"
They
sat
in
front
of
the
fire
and
Abaddon
poured
tea.
"Your
brother
got
me
in
the
habit
of
serving
tea
during
our
sessions.
He
said
the
Solomons
are
tea
drinkers."
"Family
tradition,"
Katherine
said.
"Black,
please."
They
sipped
their
tea
and
made
small
talk
for
a
few
minutes,
but
Katherine
was
eager
for
information
about
her
brother.
"Why
was
my
brother
coming
to
you?"
she
asked.
And
why
didn't
he
tell
me?
Admittedly,
Peter
had
endured
more
than
his
fair
share
of
tragedy
in
his
life
losing
his
father
at
a
young
age,
and
then,
within
a
span
of
five
years,
burying
his
only
son
and
then
his
mother.
Even
so,
Peter
had
always
found
a
way
to
cope.
Dr.
Abaddon
took
a
sip
of
tea.
"Your
brother
came
to
me
because
he
trusts
me.
We
have
a
bond
beyond
that
of
normal
patient
and
doctor."
He
motioned
to
a
framed
document
near
the
fireplace.
It
looked
like
a
diploma,
until
Katherine
spied
the
double-headed
phoenix.
"You're
a
Mason?"
The
highest
degree,
no
less.
"Peter
and
I
are
brothers
of
sorts."
"You
must
have
done
something
important
to
be
invited
into
the
thirty-third
degree."
"Not
really,"
he
said.
"I
have
family
money,
and
I
give
a
lot
of
money
to
Masonic
charities."
Katherine
now
realized
why
her
brother
trusted
this
young
doctor.
A
Mason
with
family
money,
interested
in
philanthropy
and
ancient
mythology?
Dr.
Abaddon
had
more
in
common
with
her
brother
than
she
had
initially
imagined.
"When
I
asked
why
my
brother
came
to
you,"
she
said,
"I
didn't
mean
why
did
he
choose
you.
I
meant,
why
is
he
seeking
the
services
of
a
psychiatrist?"
Dr.
Abaddon
smiled.
"Yes,
I
know.
I
was
trying
to
sidestep
the
question
politely.
It's
really
not
something
I
should
be
discussing."
He
paused.
"Although
I
must
say
I'm
puzzled
that
your
brother
would
keep
our
discussions
from
you,
considering
that
they
relate
so
directly
to
your
research."
"My
research?"
Katherine
said,
taken
totally
off
guard.
My
brother
talks
about
my
research?
"Recently,
your
brother
came
to
me
looking
for
a
professional
opinion
about
the
psychological
impact
of
the
breakthroughs
you
are
making
in
your
lab."
Katherine
almost
choked
on
the
tea.
"Really?
I'm
surprised,"
she
managed.
What
is
Peter
thinking?
He
told
his
shrink
about
my
work?!
Their
security
protocol
involved
not
discussing
with
anyone
what
Katherine
was
working
on.
Moreover,
the
confidentiality
had
been
her
brother's
idea.
"Certainly
you
are
aware,
Ms.
Solomon,
that
your
brother
is
deeply
concerned
about
what
will
happen
when
your
research
goes
public.
He
sees
the
potential
for
a
significant
philosophical
shift
in
the
world
and
he
came
here
to
discuss
the
possible
ramifications
from
a
psychological
perspective."
"I
see,"
Katherine
said,
her
teacup
now
shaking
slightly.
"The
questions
we
discuss
are
challenging
ones:
What
happens
to
the
human
condition
if
the
great
mysteries
of
life
are
finally
revealed?
What
happens
when
those
beliefs
that
we
accept
on
faith
are
suddenly
categorically
proven
as
fact?
Or
disproved
as
myth?
One
could
argue
that
there
exist
certain
questions
that
are
best
left
unanswered."
Katherine
could
not
believe
what
she
was
hearing,
and
yet
she
kept
her
emotions
in
check.
"I
hope
you
don't
mind,
Dr.
Abaddon,
but
I'd
prefer
not
to
discuss
the
details
of
my
work.
I
have
no
immediate
plans
to
make
anything
public.
For
the
time
being,
my
discoveries
will
remain
safely
locked
in
my
lab."
"Interesting."
Abaddon
leaned
back
in
his
chair,
lost
in
thought
for
a
moment.
"In
any
event,
I
asked
your
brother
to
come
back
today
because
yesterday
he
suffered
a
bit
of
a
break.
When
that
happens,
I
like
to
have
clients
"Break?"
Katherine'
s
heart
was
pounding.
"As
in
breakdown?"
She
couldn't
imagine
her
brother
breaking
down
over
anything.
Abaddon
reached
out
kindly.
"Please,
I
can
see
I've
upset
you.
I'm
sorry.
Considering
these
awkward
circumstances,
I
can
understand
how
you
might
feel
entitled
to
answers."
"Whether
I'm
entitled
or
not,"
Katherine
said,
"my
brother
is
all
I
have
left
of
my
family.
Nobody
knows
him
better
than
I
do,
so
if
you
tell
me
what
the
hell
happened,
maybe
I
can
help
you.
We
all
want
the
same
thing
what's
best
for
Peter."
Dr.
Abaddon
fell
silent
for
several
long
moments
and
then
began
slowly
nodding
as
if
Katherine
might
have
a
point.
Finally,
he
spoke.
"For
the
record,
Ms.
Solomon,
if
I
decide
to
share
this
information
with
you,
I
would
do
so
only
because
I
think
your
insights
might
help
me
assist
your
brother."
"Of
course."
Abaddon
leaned
forward,
putting
his
elbows
on
his
knees.
"Ms.
Solomon,
as
long
as
I've
been
seeing
your
brother,
I've
sensed
in
him
a
deep
struggle
with
feelings
of
guilt.
I've
never
pressed
him
on
it
because
that's
not
why
he
comes
to
me.
And
yet
yesterday,
for
a
number
of
reasons,
I
finally
asked
him
about
it."
Abaddon
locked
eyes
with
her.
"Your
brother
opened
up,
rather
dramatically
and
unexpectedly.
He
told
me
things
I
had
not
expected
to
hear
including
everything
that
happened
the
night
your
mother
died."
Christmas
Eve
almost
exactly
ten
years
ago.
She
died
in
my
arms.
"He
told
me
your
mother
was
murdered
during
a
robbery
attempt
at
your
home?
A
man
broke
in
looking
for
something
he
believed
your
brother
was
hiding?"
"That's
correct."
Abaddon's
eyes
were
appraising
her.
"Your
brother
said
he
shot
the
man
dead?"
"Yes."
Abaddon
stroked
his
chin.
"Do
you
recall
what
the
intruder
was
looking
for
when
he
broke
into
your
home?"
Katherine
had
tried
in
vain
for
ten
years
to
block
out
the
memory.
"Yes,
his
demand
was
very
specific.
Unfortunately,
none
of
us
knew
what
he
was
talking
about.
His
demand
never
made
sense
to
any
of
us."
"Well,
it
made
sense
to
your
brother."
"What?"
Katherine
sat
up.
"At
least
according
to
the
story
he
told
me
yesterday,
Peter
knew
exactly
what
the
intruder
was
looking
for.
And
yet
your
brother
did
not
want
to
hand
it
over,
so
he
pretended
not
to
understand."
"That's
absurd.
Peter
couldn't
possibly
have
known
what
the
man
wanted.
His
demands
made
no
sense!"
"Interesting."
Dr.
Abaddon
paused
and
took
a
few
notes.
"As
I
mentioned,
however,
Peter
told
me
he
did
know.
Your
brother
believes
if
he
had
only
cooperated
with
the
intruder,
maybe
your
mother
would
be
alive
today.
This
decision
is
the
source
of
all
his
guilt."
Katherine
shook
her
head.
"That's
crazy"
Abaddon
slumped,
looking
troubled.
"Ms.
Solomon,
this
has
been
useful
feedback.
As
I
feared,
your
brother
seems
to
have
had
a
little
break
with
reality.
I
must
admit,
I
was
afraid
this
might
be
the
case.
That's
why
I
asked
him
to
come
back
today.
These
delusional
episodes
are
not
uncommon
when
they
relate
to
traumatic
memories."
Katherine
shook
her
head
again.
"Peter
is
far
from
delusional,
Dr.
Abaddon."
"I
would
agree,
except"
"Except
what?'
"Except
that
his
recounting
of
the
attack
was
just
the
beginning
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
long
and
far-fetched
tale
he
told
me."
Katherine
leaned
forward
in
her
seat.
"What
did
Peter
tell
you?"
Abaddon
gave
a
sad
smile.
"Ms.
Solomon,
let
me
ask
you
this.
Has
your
brother
ever
discussed
with
you
what
he
believes
is
hidden
here
in
Washington,
D.C.
or
the
role
he
believes
he
plays
in
protecting
a
great
treasure
of
lost
ancient
wisdom?"
Katherine'
s
jaw
fell
open.
"What
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about?"
Dr.
Abaddon
heaved
a
long
sigh.
"What
I
am
about
to
tell
you
will
be
a
bit
shocking,
Katherine."
He
paused
and
locked
eyes
with
her.
"But
it
will
be
immeasurably
helpful
if
you
can
tell
me
anything
you
may
know
about
it."
He
reached
for
her
cup.
"More
tea?"
Another
tattoo.
Langdon
crouched
anxiously
beside
Peter'
s
open
palm
and
examined
the
seven
tiny
symbols
that
had
been
hidden
beneath
the
lifeless
clenched
fingers.
"They
appear
to
be
numbers,"
Langdon
said,
surprised.
"Although
I
don't
recognize
them."
"The
first
is
a
Roman
numeral,"
Anderson
said.
"Actually,
I
don't
think
so,"
Langdon
corrected.
"The
Roman
numeral
I-I-I-X
doesn't
exist.
It
would
be
written
V-I-I."
"How
about
the
rest
of
it?"
Sato
asked.
"I'm
not
sure.
It
looks
like
eight-eight-five
in
Arabic
numbers."
"Arabic?"
Anderson
asked.
"They
look
like
normal
numbers."
"Our
normal
numbers
are
Arabic."
Langdon
had
become
so
accustomed
to
clarifying
this
point
for
his
students
that
he'd
actually
prepared
a
lecture
about
the
scientific
advances
made
by
early
Middle
Eastern
cultures,
one
of
them
being
our
modern
numbering
system,
whose
advantages
over
Roman
numerals
included
'positional
notation'
and
the
invention
of
the
number
zero.
Of
course,
Langdon
always
ended
this
lecture
with
a
reminder
that
Arab
culture
had
also
given
mankind
the
word
al-kuhl
the
favorite
beverage
of
Harvard
freshmen
known
as
alcohol.
Langdon
scrutinized
the
tattoo,
feeling
puzzled.
"And
I'm
not
even
sure
about
the
eight-eight-five.
The
rectilinear
writing
looks
unusual.
Those
may
not
be
numbers."
"Then
what
are
they?
Sato
asked.
"I'm
not
sure.
The
whole
tattoo
looks
almost
runic."
"Meaning?"
Sato
asked.
"Runic
alphabets
are
composed
solely
of
straight
lines.
Their
letters
are
called
runes
and
were
often
used
for
carving
in
stone
because
curves
were
too
difficult
to
chisel."
"If
these
are
runes,"
Sato
said,
"what
is
their
meaning?"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
His
expertise
extended
only
to
the
most
rudimentary
runic
alphabet
Futhark
a
third-century
Teutonic
system,
and
this
was
not
Futhark.
"To
be
honest,
I'm
not
even
sure
these
are
runes.
You'd
need
to
ask
a
specialist.
There
are
dozens
of
different
forms
Halsinge,
Manx,
the
'dotted'
Stungnar
"Peter
Solomon
is
a
Mason,
is
he
not?"
Langdon
did
a
double
take.
"Yes,
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
this?"
He
stood
up
now,
towering
over
the
tiny
woman.
"You
tell
me.
You
just
said
that
runic
alphabets
are
used
for
stone
carvings,
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
original
Freemasons
were
stone
craftsmen.
I
mention
this
only
because
when
I
asked
my
office
to
search
for
a
connection
between
the
Hand
of
the
Mysteries
and
Peter
Solomon,
their
search
returned
one
link
in
particular."
She
paused,
as
if
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
her
finding.
"The
Masons."
Langdon
exhaled,
fighting
the
impulse
to
tell
Sato
the
same
thing
he
constantly
told
his
students:
"Google"
is
not
a
synonym
for
"research.In
these
days
of
massive,
worldwide
keyword
searches,
it
seemed
everything
was
linked
to
everything.
The
world
was
becoming
one
big
entangled
web
of
information
that
was
getting
denser
every
day.
Langdon
maintained
a
patient
tone.
"I'm
not
surprised
the
Masons
appeared
in
your
staffs
search.
Masons
are
a
very
obvious
link
between
Peter
Solomon
and
any
number
of
esoteric
topics."
"Yes,"
Sato
said,
"which
is
another
reason
I
have
been
surprised
this
evening
that
you
have
not
yet
mentioned
the
Masons.
After
all,
you've
been
talking
about
secret
wisdom
protected
by
an
enlightened
few.
That
sounds
very
Masonic,
does
it
not?"
"It
does
and
it
also
sounds
very
Rosicrucian,
Kabbalistic,
Alumbradian,
and
any
number
of
other
esoteric
groups."
"But
Peter
Solomon
is
a
Mason
a
very
powerful
Mason,
at
that.
It
seems
the
Masons
would
come
to
mind
if
we
were
talking
about
secrets.
Heaven
knows
the
Masons
love
their
secrets."
Langdon
could
hear
the
distrust
in
her
voice,
and
he
wanted
no
part
of
it.
"If
you
want
to
know
anything
about
the
Masons,
you
would
be
far
better
served
to
ask
a
Mason."
"Actually,"
Sato
said,
"I'd
prefer
to
ask
someone
I
can
trust."
Langdon
found
the
comment
both
ignorant
and
offensive.
"For
the
record,
ma'am,
the
entire
Masonic
philosophy
is
built
on
honesty
and
integrity.
Masons
are
among
the
most
trustworthy
men
you
could
ever
hope
to
meet."
"I
have
seen
persuasive
evidence
to
the
contrary."
Langdon
was
liking
Director
Sato
less
and
less
with
each
passing
moment.
He
had
spent
years
writing
about
the
Masons'
rich
tradition
of
metaphorical
iconography
and
symbols,
and
knew
that
Masons
had
always
been
one
of
the
most
unfairly
maligned
and
misunderstood
organizations
in
the
world.
Regularly
accused
of
everything
from
devil
worship
to
plotting
a
one-
world
government,
the
Masons
also
had
a
policy
of
never
responding
to
their
critics,
which
made
them
an
easy
target.
"Regardless,"
Sato
said,
her
tone
biting,
"we
are
again
at
an
impasse,
Mr.
Langdon.
It
seems
to
me
there
is
either
something
you
are
missing
or
something
you
are
not
telling
me.
The
man
we're
dealing
with
said
that
Peter
Solomon
chose
you
specifically."
She
leveled
a
cold
stare
at
Langdon.
"I
think
it's
time
we
move
this
conversation
to
CIA
headquarters.
Maybe
we'll
have
more
luck
there."
Sato's
threat
barely
registered
with
Langdon.
She
had
just
said
something
that
had
lodged
in
his
mind.
Peter
Solomon
chose
you.
The
comment,
combined
with
the
mention
of
Masons,
had
hit
Langdon
strangely.
He
looked
down
at
the
Masonic
ring
on
Peter's
finger.
The
ring
was
one
of
Peter'
s
most
prized
possessions
a
Solomon
family
heirloom
that
bore
the
symbol
of
the
double-headed
phoenix
the
ultimate
mystical
icon
of
Masonic
wisdom.
The
gold
glinted
in
the
light,
sparking
an
unexpected
memory.
Langdon
gasped,
recalling
the
eerie
whisper
of
Peter'
s
captor:
It
really
hasn
't
dawned
on
you
yet,
has
it?
Why
you
were
chosen
?
Now,
in
one
terrifying
moment,
Langdon's
thoughts
snapped
into
focus
and
the
fog
lifted.
All
at
once,
Langdon's
purpose
here
was
crystal
clear.
Ten
miles
away,
driving
south
on
Suitland
Parkway,
Mal'akh
heard
a
distinctive
vibration
on
the
seat
beside
him.
It
was
Peter
Solomon's
iPhone,
which
had
proven
a
powerful
tool
today.
The
visual
caller
ID
now
displayed
the
image
of
an
attractive
middle-aged
woman
with
long
black
hair.
INCOMING
CALL
KATHERINE
SOLOMON
Mal'akh
smiled,
ignoring
the
call.
Destiny
pulls
me
closer.
He
had
lured
Katherine
Solomon
to
his
home
this
afternoon
for
one
reason
only
to
determine
if
she
had
information
that
could
assist
him
perhaps
a
family
secret
that
might
help
Mal'akh
locate
what
he
sought.
Clearly,
however,
Katherine'
s
brother
had
told
her
nothing
of
what
he
had
been
guarding
all
these
years.
Even
so,
Mal'akh
had
learned
something
else
from
Katherine.
Something
that
has
earned
her
a
few
extra
hours
of
life
today.
Katherine
had
confirmed
for
him
that
all
of
her
research
was
in
one
location,
safely
locked
inside
her
lab.
/
must
destroy
it.
Katherine'
s
research
was
poised
to
open
a
new
door
of
understanding,
and
once
the
door
was
opened
even
a
crack,
others
would
follow.
It
would
just
be
a
matter
of
time
before
everything
changed.
/
cannot
let
that
happen.
The
world
must
stay
as
it
is
adrift
in
ignorant
darkness.
The
iPhone
beeped,
indicating
Katherine
had
left
a
voice
mail.
Mal'akh
retrieved
it.
"Peter,
it's
me
again."
Katherine'
s
voice
sounded
concerned.
"Where
are
you?
I'm
still
thinking
about
my
conversation
with
Dr.
Abaddon
and
I'm
worried.
Is
everything
okay?
Please
call
me.
I'm
at
the
lab."
The
voice
mail
ended.
Mal'akh
smiled.
Katherine
should
worry
less
about
her
brother,
and
more
about
herself.
He
turned
off
Suitland
Parkway
onto
Silver
Hill
Road.
Less
than
a
mile
later,
in
the
darkness,
he
spotted
the
faint
outline
of
the
SMSC
nestled
in
the
trees
off
the
highway
to
his
right.
The
entire
complex
was
surrounded
by
a
high
razor-wire
fence.
A
secure
building?
Mal'akh
chuckled
to
himself.
/
know
someone
who
will
open
the
door
for
me.
The
revelation
crashed
over
Langdon
like
a
wave.
/
know
why
I
am
here.
Standing
in
the
center
of
the
Rotunda,
Langdon
felt
a
powerful
urge
to
turn
and
run
away
from
Peter's
hand,
from
the
shining
gold
ring,
from
the
suspicious
eyes
of
Sato
and
Anderson.
Instead,
he
stood
dead
still,
clinging
more
tightly
to
the
leather
daybag
that
hung
on
his
shoulder.
I've
got
to
get
out
of
here.
His
jaw
clenched
as
his
memory
began
replaying
the
scene
from
that
cold
morning,
years
ago
in
Cambridge.
It
was
six
A.M.
and
Langdon
was
entering
his
classroom
as
he
always
did
following
his
ritual
morning
laps
in
the
Harvard
Pool.
The
familiar
smells
of
chalk
dust
and
steam
heat
greeted
him
as
he
crossed
the
threshold.
He
took
two
steps
toward
his
desk
but
stopped
short.
A
figure
was
waiting
there
for
him
an
elegant
gentleman
with
an
aquiline
face
and
regal
gray
eyes.
"Peter?"
Langdon
stared
in
shock.
Peter
Solomon's
smile
flashed
white
in
the
dimly
lit
room.
"Good
morning,
Robert.
Surprised
to
see
me?"
His
voice
was
soft,
and
yet
there
was
power
there.
Langdon
hurried
over
and
warmly
shook
his
friend's
hand.
"What
in
the
world
is
a
Yale
blue
blood
doing
on
the
Crimson
campus
before
dawn?"
"Covert
mission
behind
enemy
lines,"
Solomon
said,
laughing.
He
motioned
to
Langdon'
s
trim
waistline.
"Laps
are
paying
off.
You're
in
good
shape."
"Just
trying
to
make
you
feel
old,"
Langdon
said,
toying
with
him.
"It's
great
to
see
you,
Peter.
What's
up?"
"Short
business
trip,"
the
man
replied,
glancing
around
the
deserted
classroom.
"I'm
sorry
to
drop
in
on
you
like
this,
Robert,
but
I
have
only
a
few
minutes.
There's
something
I
needed
to
ask
you
in
person.
A
favor."
That's
a
first.
Langdon
wondered
what
a
simple
college
professor
could
possibly
do
for
the
man
who
had
everything.
"Anything
at
all,"
he
replied,
pleased
for
any
opportunity
to
do
something
for
someone
who
had
given
him
so
much,
especially
when
Peter's
life
of
good
fortune
had
also
been
marred
by
so
much
tragedy.
Solomon
lowered
his
voice.
"I
was
hoping
you
would
consider
looking
after
something
for
me."
Langdon
rolled
his
eyes.
"Not
Hercules,
I
hope."
Langdon
had
once
agreed
to
take
care
of
Solomon's
hundred-fifty-pound
mastiff,
Hercules,
during
Solomon's
travels.
While
at
Langdon'
s
home,
the
dog
apparently
had
become
homesick
for
his
favorite
leather
chew
toy
and
had
located
a
worthy
substitute
in
Langdon'
s
study
an
original
vellum,
hand-calligraphed,
illuminated
Bible
from
the
1600s.
Somehow
"bad
dog"
didn't
quite
seem
adequate.
"You
know,
I'm
still
searching
for
a
replacement,"
Solomon
said,
smiling
sheepishly.
"Forget
it.
I'm
glad
Hercules
got
a
taste
of
religion."
Solomon
chuckled
but
seemed
distracted.
"Robert,
the
reason
I
came
to
see
you
is
I'd
like
you
to
keep
an
eye
on
something
that
is
quite
valuable
to
me.
I
inherited
it
a
while
back,
but
I'm
no
longer
comfortable
leaving
it
in
my
home
or
in
my
office."
Langdon
immediately
felt
uncomfortable.
Anything
"quite
valuable"
in
Peter
Solomon's
world
had
to
be
worth
an
absolute
fortune.
"How
about
a
safe-deposit
box?"
Doesn't
your
family
have
stock
in
half
the
banks
in
America
?
"That
would
involve
paperwork
and
bank
employees;
I'd
prefer
a
trusted
friend.
And
I
know
you
can
keep
secrets."
Solomon
reached
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
small
package,
handing
it
to
Langdon.
Considering
the
dramatic
preamble,
Langdon
had
expected
something
more
impressive.
The
package
was
a
small
cube-shaped
box,
about
three
inches
square,
wrapped
in
faded
brown
packing
paper
and
tied
with
twine.
From
the
package's
heavy
weight
and
size,
it
felt
like
its
contents
must
be
rock
or
metal.
This
is
it?
Langdon
turned
the
box
in
his
hands,
now
noticing
the
twine
had
been
carefully
secured
on
one
side
with
an
embossed
wax
seal,
like
an
ancient
edict.
The
seal
bore
a
double-headed
phoenix
with
the
number
33
emblazoned
on
its
chest
the
traditional
symbol
of
the
highest
degree
of
Freemasonry.
"Really,
Peter,"
Langdon
said,
a
lopsided
grin
creeping
across
his
face.
"You're
the
Worshipful
Master
of
a
Masonic
lodge,
not
the
pope.
Sealing
packages
with
your
ring?"
Solomon
glanced
down
at
his
gold
ring
and
gave
a
chuckle.
"I
didn't
seal
this
package,
Robert.
My
great-
grandfather
did.
Almost
a
century
ago."
Langdon's
head
snapped
up.
"What?!"
Solomon
held
up
his
ring
finger.
"This
Masonic
ring
was
his.
After
that,
it
was
my
grandfather's,
then
my
father's
and
eventually
mine."
Langdon
held
up
the
package.
"Your
great-grandfather
wrapped
this
a
century
ago
and
nobody
has
opened
it?"
"That's
right."
"But
why
not?"
Solomon
smiled.
"Because
it's
not
time."
Langdon
stared.
"Time
for
whatT
"Robert,
I
know
this
will
sound
odd,
but
the
less
you
know,
the
better.
Just
put
this
package
somewhere
safe,
and
please
tell
no
one
I
gave
it
to
you."
Langdon
searched
his
mentor's
eyes
for
a
glint
of
playfulness.
Solomon
had
a
propensity
for
dramatics,
and
Langdon
wondered
if
he
wasn't
being
played
a
bit
here.
"Peter,
are
you
sure
this
isn't
just
a
clever
ploy
to
make
me
think
I've
been
entrusted
with
some
kind
of
ancient
Masonic
secret
so
I'll
be
curious
and
decide
to
join?"
"The
Masons
do
not
recruit,
Robert,
you
know
that.
Besides,
you've
already
told
me
you'd
prefer
not
to
join."
This
was
true.
Langdon
had
great
respect
for
Masonic
philosophy
and
symbolism,
and
yet
he
had
decided
never
to
be
initiated;
the
order's
vows
of
secrecy
would
prevent
him
from
discussing
Freemasonry
with
his
students.
It
had
been
for
this
same
reason
that
Socrates
had
refused
to
formally
participate
in
the
Eleusinian
Mysteries.
As
Langdon
now
regarded
the
mysterious
little
box
and
its
Masonic
seal,
he
could
not
help
but
ask
the
obvious
question.
"Why
not
entrust
this
to
one
of
your
Masonic
brothers?"
"Let's
just
say
I
have
an
instinct
it
would
be
safer
stored
outside
the
brotherhood.
And
please
don't
let
the
size
of
this
package
fool
you.
If
what
my
father
told
me
is
correct,
then
it
contains
something
of
substantial
power."
He
paused.
"A
talisman,
of
sorts."
Did
he
say
a
talisman?
By
definition,
a
talisman
was
an
object
with
magical
powers.
Traditionally,
talismans
were
used
for
bringing
luck,
warding
off
evil
spirits,
or
aiding
in
ancient
rituals.
"Peter,
you
do
realize
that
talismans
went
out
of
vogue
in
the
Middle
Ages,
right?"
Peter
laid
a
patient
hand
on
Langdon's
shoulder.
"I
know
how
this
sounds,
Robert.
I've
known
you
a
long
time,
and
your
skepticism
is
one
of
your
greatest
strengths
as
an
academic.
It
is
also
your
greatest
weakness.
I
know
you
well
enough
to
know
you're
not
a
man
I
can
ask
to
believe
only
to
trust.
So
now
I
am
asking
you
to
trust
me
when
I
tell
you
this
talisman
is
powerful.
I
was
told
it
can
imbue
its
possessor
with
the
ability
to
bring
order
from
chaos."
Langdon
could
only
stare.
The
idea
of
"order
from
chaos"
was
one
of
the
great
Masonic
axioms.
Ordo
ab
chao.
Even
so,
the
claim
that
a
talisman
could
impart
any
power
at
all
was
absurd,
much
less
the
power
to
bring
order
from
chaos.
"This
talisman,"
Solomon
continued,
"would
be
dangerous
in
the
wrong
hands,
and
unfortunately,
I
have
reason
to
believe
powerful
people
want
to
steal
it
from
me."
His
eyes
were
as
serious
as
Langdon
could
ever
recall.
"I
would
like
you
to
keep
it
safe
for
me
for
a
while.
Can
you
do
that?"
That
night,
Langdon
sat
alone
at
his
kitchen
table
with
the
package
and
tried
to
imagine
what
could
possibly
be
inside.
In
the
end,
he
simply
chalked
it
up
to
Peter's
eccentricity
and
locked
the
package
in
his
library's
wall
safe,
eventually
forgetting
all
about
it.
That
was
until
this
morning.
The
phone
call
from
the
man
with
the
southern
accent.
"Oh,
Professor,
I
almost
forgot!"
the
assistant
had
said
after
giving
Langdon
the
specifics
of
his
travel
arrangements
to
D.C.
"There
is
one
more
thing
Mr.
Solomon
requested."
"Yes?"
Langdon
replied,
his
mind
already
moving
to
the
lecture
he
had
just
agreed
to
give.
"Mr.
Solomon
left
a
note
here
for
you."
The
man
began
reading
awkwardly,
as
if
trying
to
decipher
Peter's
penmanship.
'"Please
ask
Robert
to
bring
the
small,
sealed
package
I
gave
him
many
years
ago.'
The
man
paused.
"Does
this
make
any
sense
to
you?"
Langdon
felt
surprised
as
he
recalled
the
small
box
that
had
been
sitting
in
his
wall
safe
all
this
time.
"Actually,
yes.
I
know
what
Peter
means."
"And
you
can
bring
it?"
"Of
course.
Tell
Peter
I'll
bring
it."
"Wonderful."
The
assistant
sounded
relieved.
"Enjoy
your
speech
tonight.
Safe
travels."
Before
leaving
home,
Langdon
had
dutifully
retrieved
the
wrapped
package
from
the
back
of
his
safe
and
placed
it
in
his
shoulder
bag.
Now
he
was
standing
in
the
U.S.
Capitol,
feeling
certain
of
only
one
thing.
Peter
Solomon
would
be
horrified
to
know
how
badly
Langdon
had
failed
him.
My
God,
Katherine
was
right.
As
usual.
Trish
Dunne
stared
in
amazement
at
the
search-spider
results
that
were
materializing
on
the
plasma
wall
before
her.
She
had
doubted
the
search
would
turn
up
any
results
at
all,
but
in
fact,
she
now
had
over
a
dozen
hits.
And
they
were
still
coming
in.
One
entry
in
particular
looked
quite
promising.
Trish
turned
and
shouted
in
the
direction
of
the
library.
"Katherine?
I
think
you'll
want
to
see
this!"
It
had
been
a
couple
of
years
since
Trish
had
run
a
search
spider
like
this,
and
tonight's
results
astounded
her.
A
few
years
ago,
this
search
would
have
been
a
dead
end.
Now,
however,
it
seemed
that
the
quantity
of
searchable
digital
material
in
the
world
had
exploded
to
the
point
where
someone
could
find
literally
anything.
Incredibly,
one
of
the
keywords
was
a
word
Trish
had
never
even
heard
before
and
the
search
even
found
that.
Katherine
rushed
through
the
control-room
door.
"What
have
you
got?"
"A
bunch
of
candidates."
Trish
motioned
to
the
plasma
wall.
"Every
one
of
these
documents
contains
all
of
your
key
phrases
verbatim."
Katherine
tucked
her
hair
behind
her
ear
and
scanned
the
list.
"Before
you
get
too
excited,"
Trish
added,
"I
can
assure
you
that
most
of
these
documents
are
not
what
you're
looking
for.
They're
what
we
call
black
holes.
Look
at
the
file
sizes.
Absolutely
enormous.
They're
things
like
compressed
archives
of
millions
of
e-mails,
giant
unabridged
encyclopedia
sets,
global
message
boards
that
have
been
running
for
years,
and
so
forth.
By
virtue
of
their
size
and
diverse
content,
these
files
contain
so
many
potential
keywords
that
they
suck
in
any
search
engine
that
comes
anywhere
near
them."
Katherine
pointed
to
one
of
the
entries
near
the
top
of
the
list.
"How
about
that
one?"
Trish
smiled.
Katherine
was
a
step
ahead,
having
found
the
sole
file
on
the
list
that
had
a
small
file
size.
"Good
eyes.
Yeah,
that's
really
our
only
candidate
so
far.
In
fact,
that
file's
so
small
it
can't
be
more
than
a
page
or
so."
"Open
it."
Katherine'
s
tone
was
intense.
Trish
could
not
imagine
a
one-page
document
containing
all
the
strange
search
strings
Katherine
had
provided.
Nonetheless,
when
she
clicked
and
opened
the
document,
the
key
phrases
were
there
crystal
clear
and
easy
to
spot
in
the
text.
Katherine
strode
over,
eyes
riveted
to
the
plasma
wall.
"This
document
is
redacted!'"
Trish
nodded.
"Welcome
to
the
world
of
digitized
text."
Automatic
redaction
had
become
standard
practice
when
offering
digitized
documents.
Redaction
was
a
process
wherein
a
server
allowed
a
user
to
search
the
entire
text,
but
then
revealed
only
a
small
portion
of
it
a
teaser
of
sorts
only
that
text
immediately
flanking
the
requested
keywords.
By
omitting
the
vast
majority
of
the
text,
the
server
avoided
copyright
infringement
and
also
sent
the
user
an
intriguing
message:
/

the
information
you
're
searching
for,
but
if
you
want
the
rest
of
it,

it
from
me.
"As
you
can
see,"
Trish
said,
scrolling
through
the
heavily
abridged
page,
"the
document
contains
all
of
your
key
phrases."
Katherine
stared
up
at
the
redaction
in
silence.
Trish
gave
her
a
minute
and
then
scrolled
back
to
the
top
of
the
page.
Each
of
Katherine'
s
key
phrases
was
underlined
in
capital
letters
and
accompanied
by
a
small
sample
of
teaser
text
the
two
words
that
appeared
on

side
of
the
requested

Trish
could
not
imagine
what
this
document
was
referring
to.
And
what
the
heck
is
a
"symbolon
"?
Katherine
stepped
eagerly
toward
the
screen.
"Where
did
this
document
come
from?
Who
wrote
it?"
Trish
was
already
working
on
it.
"Give
me
a
second.
I'm
trying
to
chase
down
the
source."
"I
need
to
know
who
wrote
this,"
Katherine
repeated,
her
voice
intense.
"I
need
to
see
the
rest
of
it."
"I'm
trying,"
Trish
said,
startled
by
the
edge
in
Katherine's
tone.
Strangely,
the
file's
location
was
not
displaying
as
a
traditional
Web
address
but
rather
as
a
numeric
Internet
Protocol
address.
"I
can't
unmask
the
IP,"
Trish
said.
"The
domain
name's
not
coming
up.
Hold
on."
She
pulled
up
her
terminal
window.
"I'll
run
a
traceroute."
Trish
typed
the
sequence
of
commands
to
ping
all
the
"hops"
between
her
control
room's
machine
and
whatever
machine
was
storing
this
document.
"Tracing
now,"
she
said,
executing
the
command.
Traceroutes
were
extremely
fast,
and
a
long
list
of
network
devices
appeared
almost
instantly
on
the
plasma
wall.
Trish
scanned
down
down
through
the
path
of
routers
and
switches
that
connected
her
machine
to
What
the
hell?
Her
trace
had
stopped
before
reaching
the
document's
server.
Her
ping,
for
some
reason,
had
hit
a
network
device
that
swallowed
it
rather
than
bouncing
it
back.
"It
looks
like
my
traceroute
got
blocked,"
Trish
said.
Is
that
even
possible?
"Run
it
again."
Trish
launched
another
traceroute
and
got
the
same
result.
"Nope.
Dead
end.
It's
like
this
document
is
on
a
server
that
is
untraceable."
She
looked
at
the
last
few
hops
before
the
dead
end.
"I
can
tell
you,
though,
it's
located
somewhere
in
the
D.C.
area."
"You're
kidding."
"Not
surprising,"
Trish
said.
"These
spider
programs
spiral
out
geographically,
meaning
the
first
results
are
always
local.
Besides,
one
of
your
search
strings
was
'Washington,
D.C
"How
about
a
'who
is'
search?"
Katherine
prompted.
"Wouldn't
that
tell
you
who
owns
the
domain?"
A
bit
lowbrow,
but
not
a
bad
idea.
Trish
navigated
to
the
"who
is"
database
and
ran
a
search
for
the
IP,
hoping
to
match
the
cryptic
numbers
to
an
actual
domain
name.
Her
frustration
was
now
tempered
by
rising
curiosity.
Who
has
this
document?
The
"who
is"
results
appeared
quickly,
showing
no
match,
and
Trish
held
up
her
hands
in
defeat.
"It's
like
this
IP
address
doesn't
exist.
I
can't
get
any
information
about
it
at
all."
"Obviously
the
IP
exists.
We've
just
searched
a
document
that's
stored
there!"
True.
And
yet
whoever
had
this
document
apparently
preferred
not
to
share
his
or
her
identity.
"I'm
not
sure
what
to
tell
you.
Systems
traces
aren't
really
my
thing,
and
unless
you
want
to
call
in
someone
with
hacking
skills,
I'm
at
a
loss."
"Do
you
know
someone?"
Trish
turned
and
stared
at
her
boss.
"Katherine,
I
was
kidding.
It's
not
exactly
a
great
idea."
"But
it
is
done?"
She
checked
her
watch.
"Um,
yeah
all
the
time.
Technically
it's
pretty
easy."
"Who
do
you
know?"
"Hackers?"
Trish
laughed
nervously.
"Like
half
the
guys
at
my
old
job."
"Anyone
you
trust?"
Is
she
serious?
Trish
could
see
Katherine
was
dead
serious.
"Well,
yeah,"
she
said
hurriedly.
"I
know
this
one
guy
we
could
call.
He
was
our
systems
security
specialist
serious
computer
geek.
He
wanted
to
date
me,
which
kind
of
sucked,
but
he's
a
good
guy,
and
I'd
trust
him.
Also,
he
does
freelance."
"Can
he
be
discreet?"
"He's
a
hacker.
Of
course
he
can
be
discreet.
That's
what
he
does.
But
I'm
sure
he'd
want
at
least
a
thousand
bucks
to
even
look
"Call
him.
Offer
him
double
for
fast
results."
Trish
was
not
sure
what
made
her
more
uncomfortable
helping
Katherine
Solomon
hire
a
hacker
or
calling
a
guy
who
probably
still
found
it
impossible
to
believe
a
pudgy,
redheaded
metasystems
analyst
would
rebuff
his
romantic
advances.
"You're
sure
about
this?"
"Use
the
phone
in
the
library,"
Katherine
said.
"It's
got
a
blocked
number.
And
obviously
don't
use
my
name."
"Right."
Trish
headed
for
the
door
but
paused
when
she
heard
Katherine'
s
iPhone
chirp.
With
luck,
the
incoming
text
message
might
be
information
that
would
grant
Trish
a
reprieve
from
this
distasteful
task.
She
waited
as
Katherine
fished
the
iPhone
from
her
lab
coat's
pocket
and
eyed
the
screen.
Katherine
Solomon
felt
a
wave
of
relief
to
see
the
name
on
her
iPhone.
At
last.
PETER
SOLOMON
"It's
a
text
message
from
my
brother,"
she
said,
glancing
over
at
Trish.
Trish
looked
hopeful.
"So
maybe
we
should
ask
him
about
all
this
before
we
call
a
hacker?"
Katherine
eyed
the
redacted
document
on
the
plasma
wall
and
heard
Dr.
Abaddon's
voice.
That
which
your
brother
believes
is
hidden
in
D.C.
it
can
be
found.
Katherine
had
no
idea
what
to
believe
anymore,
and
this
document
represented
information
about
the
far-fetched
ideas
with
which
Peter
had
apparently
become
obsessed.
Katherine
shook
her
head.
"I
want
to
know
who
wrote
this
and
where
it's
located.
Make
the
call."
Trish
frowned
and
headed
for
the
door.
Whether
or
not
this
document
would
be
able
to
explain
the
mystery
of
what
her
brother
had
told
Dr.
Abaddon,
there
was
at
least
one
mystery
that
had
been
solved
today.
Her
brother
had
finally
learned
how
to
use
the
text-messaging
feature
on
the
iPhone
Katherine
had
given
him.
"And
alert
the
media,"
Katherine
called
after
Trish.
"The
great
Peter
Solomon
just
sent
his
first
text
message."
In
a
strip-mall
parking
lot
across
the
street
from
the
SMSC,
Mal'akh
stood
beside
his
limo,
stretching
his
legs
and
waiting
for
the
phone
call
he
knew
would
be
coming.
The
rain
had
stopped,
and
a
winter
moon
had
started
to
break
through
the
clouds.
It
was
the
same
moon
that
had
shone
down
on
Mal'akh
through
the
oculus
of
the
House
of
the
Temple
three
months
ago
during
his
initiation.
The
world
looks
different
tonight.
As
he
waited,
his
stomach
growled
again.
His
two-day
fast,
although
uncomfortable,
was
critical
to
his
preparation.
Such
were
the
ancient
ways.
Soon
all
physical
discomforts
would
be
inconsequential.
As
Mal'akh
stood
in
the
cold
night
air,
he
chuckled
to
see
that
fate
had
deposited
him,
rather
ironically,
directly
in
front
of
a
tiny
church.
Here,
nestled
between
Sterling
Dental
and
a
minimart,
was
a
tiny
sanctuary.
LORD'S
HOUSE
OF
GLORY.
Mal'akh
gazed
at
the
window,
which
displayed
part
of
the
church's
doctrinal
statement:
WE
BELIEVE
THAT
JESUS
CHRIST
WAS
BEGOTTEN
BY
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT,
AND
BORN
OF
THE
VIRGIN
MARY,
AND
IS
BOTH
TRUE
MAN
AND
GOD.
Mal'akh
smiled.
Yes,
Jesus
is
indeed
both
man
and
God
but
a
virgin
birth
is
not
the
prerequisite
for
divinity.
That
is
not
how
it
happens.
The
ring
of
a
cell
phone
cut
the
night
air,
quickening
his
pulse.
The
phone
that
was
now
ringing
was
Mal'akh's
own
a
cheap
disposable
phone
he
had
purchased
yesterday.
The
caller
ID
indicated
it
was
the
call
he
had
been
anticipating.
A
local
call,
Mal'akh
mused,
gazing
out
across
Silver
Hill
Road
toward
the
faint
moonlit
outline
of
a
zigzag
roofline
over
the
treetops.
Mal'akh
flipped
open
his
phone.
"This
is
Dr.
Abaddon,"
he
said,
tuning
his
voice
deeper.
"It's
Katherine,"
the
woman's
voice
said.
"I
finally
heard
from
my
brother."
"Oh,
I'm
relieved.
How
is
he?"
"He's
on
his
way
to
my
lab
right
now,"
Katherine
said.
"In
fact,
he
suggested
you
join
us."
"I'm
sorry?"
Mal'akh
feigned
hesitation.
"In
your
lab?"
"He
must
trust
you
deeply.
He
never
invites
anyone
back
there."
"I
suppose
maybe
he
thinks
a
visit
might
help
our
discussions,
but
I
feel
like
it's
an
intrusion."
"If
my
brother
says
you're
welcome,
then
you're
welcome.
Besides,
he
said
he
has
a
lot
to
tell
us
both,
and
I'd
love
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
what's
going
on."
"Very
well,
then.
Where
exactly
is
your
lab?"
"At
the
Smithsonian
Museum
Support
Center.
Do
you
know
where
that
is?"
"No,"
Mal'akh
said,
staring
across
the
parking
lot
at
the
complex.
"I'm
actually
in
my
car
right
now,
and
I
have
a
guidance
system.
What's
the
address?"
"Forty-two-ten
Silver
Hill
Road."
"Okay,
hold
on.
I'll
type
it
in."
Mal'akh
waited
for
ten
seconds
and
then
said,
"Ah,
good
news,
it
looks
like
I'm
closer
than
I
thought.
The
GPS
says
I'm
only
about
ten
minutes
away."
"Great.
I'll
phone
the
security
gate
and
tell
them
you're
coming
through."
"Thank
you."
"I'll
see
you
shortly."
Mal'akh
pocketed
the
disposable
phone
and
looked
out
toward
the
SMSC.
Was
I
rude
to
invite
myself?
Smiling,
he
now
pulled
out
Peter
Solomon's
iPhone
and
admired
the
text
message
he
had
sent
Katherine
several
minutes
earlier.
Got
your
messages.
All's
fine.
Busy
day.
Forgot
appointment
with
Dr.
Abaddon.
Sorry
not
to
mention
him
sooner.
Long
story.
Am
headed
to
lab
now.
If
available,
have
Dr.
Abaddon
join
us
inside.
I
trust
him
fully,
and
I
have
much
to
tell
you
both.
Peter
Not
surprisingly,
Peter's
iPhone
now
pinged
with
an
incoming
reply
from
Katherine.
peter,
congrats
on
learning
to
text!
relieved
you're
okay,
spoke
to
dr.
A.,
and
he
is
coming
to
lab.
see
you
shortly!
k
Clutching
Solomon's
iPhone,
Mal'akh
crouched
down
under
his
limousine
and
wedged
the
phone
between
the
front
tire
and
the
pavement.
This
phone
had
served
Mal'akh
well
but
now
it
was
time
it
became
untraceable.
He
climbed
behind
the
wheel,
put
the
car
in
gear,
and
crept
forward
until
he
heard
the
sharp
crack
of
the
iPhone
imploding.
Mal'akh
put
the
car
back
in
park
and
stared
out
at
the
distant
silhouette
of
the
SMSC.
Ten
minutes.
Peter
Solomon's
sprawling
warehouse
housed
over
thirty
million
treasures,
but
Mal'akh
had
come
here
tonight
to
obliterate
only
the
two
most
valuable.
All
of
Katherine
Solomon's
research.
And
Katherine
Solomon
herself.
Professor
Langdon?"
Sato
said.
"You
look
like
you've
seen
a
ghost.
Are
you
okay?"
Langdon
hoisted
his
daybag
higher
onto
his
shoulder
and
laid
his
hand
on
top
of
it,
as
if
somehow
this
might
better
hide
the
cube-shaped
package
he
was
carrying.
He
could
feel
his
face
had
gone
ashen.
"I'm
just
worried
about
Peter."
Sato
cocked
her
head,
eyeing
him
askew.
Langdon
felt
a
sudden
wariness
that
Sato's
involvement
tonight
might
relate
to
this
small
package
that
Solomon
had
entrusted
to
him.
Peter
had
warned
Langdon:
Powerful
people
want
to
steal
this.
It
would
be
dangerous
in
the
wrong
hands.
Langdon
couldn't
imagine
why
the
CIA
would
want
a
little
box
containing
a
talisman
or
even
what
the
talisman
could
be.
Ordo
ab
chao?
Sato
stepped
closer,
her
black
eyes
probing.
"I
sense
you've
had
a
revelation?"
Langdon
felt
himself
sweating
now.
"No,
not
exactly."
"What's
on
your
mind?"
"I
just"
Langdon
hesitated,
having
no
idea
what
to
say.
He
had
no
intention
of
revealing
the
existence
of
the
package
in
his
bag,
and
yet
if
Sato
took
him
to
the
CIA,
his
bag
most
certainly
would
be
searched
on
the
way
in.
"Actually"
he
fibbed,
"I
have
another
idea
about
the
numbers
on
Peter's
hand."
Sato's
expression
revealed
nothing.
"Yes?"
She
glanced
over
at
Anderson
now,
who
was
just
arriving
from
greeting
the
forensics
team
that
had
finally
arrived.
Langdon
swallowed
hard
and
crouched
down
beside
the
hand,
wondering
what
he
could
possibly
come
up
with
to
tell
them.
You're
a
teacher,
Robert
improvise!
He
took
one
last
look
at
the
seven
tiny
symbols,
hoping
for
some
sort
of
inspiration.
Nothing.
Blank.
As
Langdon'
s
eidetic
memory
skimmed
through
his
mental
encyclopedia
of
symbols,
he
could
find
only
one
possible
point
to
make.
It
was
something
that
had
occurred
to
him
initially,
but
had
seemed
unlikely.
At
the
moment,
however,
he
had
to
buy
time
to
think.
"Well,"
he
began,
"a
symbologist'
s
first
clue
that
he's
on
the
wrong
track
when
deciphering
symbols
and
codes
is
when
he
starts
interpreting
symbols
using
multiple
symbolic
languages.
For
example,
when
I
told
you
this
text
was
Roman
and
Arabic,
that
was
a
poor
analysis
because
I
used
multiple
symbolic
systems.
The
same
is
true
for
Roman
and
runic."
Sato
crossed
her
arms
and
arched
her
eyebrows
as
if
to
say,
"Go
on."
"In
general,
communications
are
made
in
one
language,
not
multiple
languages,
and
so
a
symbologist'
s
first
job
with
any
text
is
to
find
a
single
consistent
symbolic
system
that
applies
to
the
entire
text."
"And
you
see
a
single
system
now?"
"Well,
yes
and
no."
Langdon'
s
experience
with
the
rotational
symmetry
of
ambigrams
had
taught
him
that
symbols
sometimes
had
meanings
from
multiple
angles.
In
this
case,
he
realized
there
was
indeed
a
way
to
view
all
seven
symbols
in
a
single
language.
"If
we
manipulated
the
hand
slightly,
the
language
will
become
consistent."
Eerily,
the
manipulation
Langdon
was
about
to
perform
was
one
that
seemed
to
have
been
suggested
by
Peter's
captor
already
when
he
spoke
the
ancient
Hermetic
adage.
As
above,
so
below.
Langdon
felt
a
chill
as
he
reached
out
and
grasped
the
wooden
base
on
which
Peter's
hand
was
secured.
Gently,
he
turned
the
base
upside
down
so
that
Peter's
extended
fingers
were
now
pointing
straight
down.
The
symbols
on
the
palm
instantly
transformed
themselves.
"From
this
angle,"
Langdon
said,
"X-I-I-I
becomes
a
valid
Roman
numeral
thirteen.
Moreover,
the
rest
of
the
characters
can
be
interpreted
using
the
Roman
alphabet
SBB."
Langdon
assumed
the
analysis
would
elicit
blank
shrugs,
but
Anderson's
expression
immediately
changed.
"SBB?"
the
chief
demanded.
Sato
turned
to
Anderson.
"If
I'm
not
mistaken,
that
sounds
like
a
familiar
numbering
system
here
in
the
Capitol
Building."
Anderson
looked
pale.
"It
is."
Sato
gave
a
grim
smile
and
nodded
to
Anderson.
"Chief,
follow
me,
please.
I'd
like
a
word
in
private."
As
Director
Sato
led
Chief
Anderson
out
of
earshot,
Langdon
stood
alone
in
bewilderment.
What
the
hell
is
going
on
here?
And
what
is
SBB
XIII?
Chief
Anderson
wondered
how
this
night
could
possibly
get
any
stranger.
The
hand
says
SBB13?
He
was
amazed
any
outsider
had
even
heard
of
SBB
much
less
SBB13.
Peter
Solomon's
index
finger,
it
seemed,
was
not
directing
them
upward
as
it
had
appeared
but
rather
was
pointing
in
quite
the
opposite
direction.
Director
Sato
led
Anderson
over
to
a
quiet
area
near
the
bronze
statue
of
Thomas
Jefferson.
"Chief,"
she
said,
"I
trust
you
know
exactly
where
SBB
Thirteen
is
located?"
"Of
course."
"Do
you
know
what's
inside?"
"No,
not
without
looking.
I
don't
think
it's
been
used
in
decades."
"Well,
you're
going
to
open
it
up."
Anderson
did
not
appreciate
being
told
what
he
would
do
in
his
own
building.
"Ma'am,
that
may
be
problematic.
I'll
have
to
check
the
assignment
roster
first.
As
you
know,
most
of
the
lower
levels
are
private
offices
or
storage,
and
security
protocol
regarding
private
"You
will
unlock
SBB
Thirteen
for
me,"
Sato
said,
"or
I
will
call
OS
and
send
in
a
team
with
a
battering
ram."
Anderson
stared
at
her
a
long
moment
and
then
pulled
out
his
radio,
raising
it
to
his
lips.
"This
is
Anderson.
I
need
someone
to
unlock
the
SBB.
Have
someone
meet
me
there
in
five
minutes."
The
voice
that
replied
sounded
confused.
"Chief,
confirming
you
said
SBB?"
"Correct.
SBB.
Send
someone
immediately.
And
I'll
need
a
flashlight."
He
stowed
his
radio.
Anderson's
heart
was
pounding
as
Sato
stepped
closer,
lowering
her
voice
even
further.
"Chief,
time
is
short,"
she
whispered,
"and
I
want
you
to
get
us
down
to
SBB
Thirteen
as
quickly
as
possible."
"Yes,
ma'am."
"I
also
need
something
else
from
you."
In
addition
to
breaking
and
entering?
Anderson
was
in
no
position
to
protest,
and
yet
it
had
not
gone
unnoticed
by
him
that
Sato
had
arrived
within
minutes
of
Peter's
hand
appearing
in
the
Rotunda,
and
that
she
now
was
using
the
situation
to
demand
access
to
private
sections
of
the
U.S.
Capitol.
She
seemed
so
far
ahead
of
the
curve
tonight
that
she
was
practically
defining
it.
Sato
motioned
across
the
room
toward
the
professor.
"The
duffel
bag
on
Langdon'
s
shoulder."
Anderson
glanced
over.
"What
about
it?"
"I
assume
your
staff
X-rayed
that
bag
when
Langdon
entered
the
building?"
"Of
course.
All
bags
are
scanned."
"I
want
to
see
that
X-ray.
I
want
to
know
what's
in
his
bag."
Anderson
looked
over
at
the
bag
Langdon
had
been
carrying
all
evening.
"But
wouldn't
it
be
easier
just
to
ask
him?"
"What
part
of
my
request
was
unclear?"
Anderson
pulled
out
his
radio
again
and
called
in
her
request.
Sato
gave
Anderson
her
BlackBerry
address
and
requested
that
his
team
e-mail
her
a
digital
copy
of
the
X-ray
as
soon
as
they
had
located
it.
Reluctantly
Anderson
complied.
Forensics
was
now
collecting
the
severed
hand
for
the
Capitol
Police,
but
Sato
ordered
them
to
deliver
it
directly
to
her
team
at
Langley.
Anderson
was
too
tired
to
protest.
He
had
just
been
run
over
by
a
tiny
Japanese
steamroller.
'And
I
want
that
ring,"
Sato
called
over
to
Forensics.
The
chief
technician
seemed
ready
to
question
her
but
thought
better
of
it.
He
removed
the
gold
ring
from
Peter's
hand,
placed
it
in
a
clear
specimen
bag,
and
gave
it
to
Sato.
She
slipped
it
into
her
jacket
pocket,
and
then
turned
to
Langdon.
"We're
leaving,
Professor.
Bring
your
things."
"Where
are
we
going?"
Langdon
replied.
"Just
follow
Mr.
Anderson."
Yes,
Anderson
thought,
and
follow
me
closely.
The
SBB
was
a
section
of
the
Capitol
that
few
ever
visited.
To
reach
it,
they
would
pass
through
a
sprawling
labyrinth
of
tiny
chambers
and
tight
passages
buried
beneath
the
crypt.
Abraham
Lincoln's
youngest
son,
Tad,
had
once
gotten
lost
down
there
and
almost
perished.
Anderson
was
starting
to
suspect
that
if
Sato
had
her
way,
Robert
Langdon
might
suffer
a
similar
fate.
Systems
security
specialist
Mark
Zoubianis
had
always
prided
himself
on
his
ability
to
multitask.
At
the
moment,
he
was
seated
on
his
futon
along
with
a
TV
remote,
a
cordless
phone,
a
laptop,
a
PDA,
and
a
large
bowl
of
Pirate's
Booty.
With
one
eye
on
the
muted
Redskins
game
and
one
eye
on
his
laptop,
Zoubianis
was
speaking
on
his
Bluetooth
headset
with
a
woman
he
had
not
heard
from
in
over
a
year.
Leave
it
to
Trish
Dunne
to
call
on
the
night
of
a
play-off
game.
Confirming
her
social
ineptitude
yet
again,
his
former
colleague
had
chosen
the
Redskins
game
as
a
perfect
moment
to
chat
him
up
and
request
a
favor.
After
some
brief
small
talk
about
the
old
days
and
how
she
missed
his
great
jokes,
Trish
had
gotten
to
her
point:
she
was
trying
to
unmask
a
hidden
IP
address,
probably
that
of
a
secure
server
in
the
D.C.
area.
The
server
contained
a
small
text
document,
and
she
wanted
access
to
it
or
at
the
very
least,
some
information
about
whose
document
it
was.
Right
guy,
wrong
timing,
he
had
told
her.
Trish
then
showered
him
with
her
finest
geek
flattery,
most
of
which
was
true,
and
before
Zoubianis
knew
it,
he
was
typing
a
strange-looking
IP
address
into
his
laptop.
Zoubianis
took
one
look
at
the
number
and
immediately
felt
uneasy.
"Trish,
this
IP
has
a
funky
format.
It's
written
in
a
protocol
that
isn't
even
publicly
available
yet.
It's
probably
gov
intel
or
military."
"Military?"
Trish
laughed.
"Believe
me,
I
just
pulled
a
redacted
document
off
this
server,
and
it
was
not
military."
Zoubianis
pulled
up
his
terminal
window
and
tried
a
traceroute.
"You
said
your
traceroute
died?"
"Yeah.
Twice.
Same
hop."
"Mine,
too."
He
pulled
up
a
diagnostic
probe
and
launched
it.
"And
what's
so
interesting
about
this
IP?"
"I
ran
a
delegator
that
tapped
a
search
engine
at
this
IP
and
pulled
a
redacted
document.
I
need
to
see
the
rest
of
the
document.
I'm
happy
to
pay
them
for
it,
but
I
can't
figure
out
who
owns
the
IP
or
how
to
access
it."
Zoubianis
frowned
at
his
screen.
"Are
you
sure
about
this?
I'm
running
a
diagnostic,
and
this
firewall
coding
looks
pretty
serious."
"That's
why
you
get
the
big
bucks."
Zoubianis
considered
it.
They'd
offered
him
a
fortune
for
a
job
this
easy.
"One
question,
Trish.
Why
are
you
so
hot
on
this?"
Trish
paused.
"I'm
doing
a
favor
for
a
friend."
"Must
be
a
special
friend."
"She
is."
Zoubianis
chuckled
and
held
his
tongue.
/
knew
it.
"Look,"
Trish
said,
sounding
impatient.
"Are
you
good
enough
to
unmask
this
IP?
Yes
or
no?"
"Yes,
I'm
good
enough.
And
yes,
I
know
you're
playing
me
like
a
fiddle."
"How
long
will
it
take
you?"
"Not
long,"
he
said,
typing
as
he
spoke.
"I
should
be
able
to
get
into
a
machine
on
their
network
within
ten
minutes
or
so.
Once
I'm
in
and
know
what
I'm
looking
at,
I'll
call
you
back."
"I
appreciate
it.
So,
are
you
doing
well?"
Now
she
asks?
"Trish,
for
God's
sake,
you
called
me
on
the
night
of
a
play-off
game
and
now
you
want
to
chat?
Do
you
want
me
to
hack
this
IP
or
not?"
"Thanks,
Mark.
I
appreciate
it.
I'll
be
waiting
for
your
call."
"Fifteen
minutes."
Zoubianis
hung
up,
grabbed
his
bowl
of
Pirate's
Booty,
and
unmuted
the
game.
Women.
Where
are
they
taking
me:
As
Langdon
hurried
with
Anderson
and
Sato
into
the
depths
of
the
Capitol,
he
felt
his
heart
rate
increasing
with
each
downward
step.
They
had
begun
their
journey
through
the
west
portico
of
the
Rotunda,
descending
a
marble
staircase
and
then
doubling
back
through
a
wide
doorway
into
the
famous
chamber
directly
beneath
the
Rotunda
floor.
The
Capitol
Crypt.
The
air
was
heavier
here,
and
Langdon
was
already
feeling
claustrophobic.
The
crypt's
low
ceiling
and
soft
uplighting
accentuated
the
robust
girth
of
the
forty
Doric
columns
required
to
support
the
vast
stone
floor
directly
overhead.
Relax,
Robert.
"This
way,"
Anderson
said,
moving
quickly
as
he
angled
to
the
left
across
the
wide
circular
space.
Thankfully,
this
particular
crypt
contained
no
bodies.
Instead
it
contained
several
statues,
a
model
of
the
Capitol,
and
a
low
storage
area
for
the
wooden
catafalque
on
which
coffins
were
laid
for
state
funerals.
The
entourage
hurried
through,
without
even
a
glance
at
the
four-pointed
marble
compass
in
the
center
of
the
floor
where
the
Eternal
Flame
had
once
burned.
Anderson
seemed
to
be
in
a
hurry,
and
Sato
once
again
had
her
head
buried
in
her
BlackBerry.
Cellular
service,
Langdon
had
heard,
was
boosted
and
broadcast
to
all
corners
of
the
Capitol
Building
to
support
the
hundreds
of
government
phone
calls
that
took
place
here
every
day.
After
diagonally
crossing
the
crypt,
the
group
entered
a
dimly
lit
foyer
and
began
winding
through
a
convoluted
series
of
hallways
and
dead
ends.
The
warren
of
passages
contained
numbered
doorways,
each
of
which
bore
an
identification
number.
Langdon
read
the
doors
as
they
snaked
their
way
around.
S154
S153
S152
He
had
no
idea
what
lay
behind
these
doors,
but
at
least
one
thing
now
seemed
clear
the
meaning
of
the
tattoo
on
Peter
Solomon's
palm.
SBB13
appeared
to
be
a
numbered
doorway
somewhere
in
the
bowels
of
the
U.S.
Capitol
Building.
"What
are
all
these
doorways?"
Langdon
asked,
clutching
his
daybag
tightly
to
his
ribs
and
wondering
what
Solomon's
tiny
package
could
possibly
have
to
do
with
a
door
marked
SBB13.
"Offices
and
storage,"
Anderson
said.
"Private
offices
and
storage,"
he
added,
glancing
back
at
Sato.
Sato
did
not
even
glance
up
from
her
BlackBerry.
"They
look
tiny,"
Langdon
said.
"Glorified
closets,
most
of
them,
but
they're
still
some
of
the
most
sought-after
real
estate
in
D.C.
This
is
the
heart
of
the
original
Capitol,
and
the
old
Senate
chamber
is
two
stories
above
us."
"And
SBB
Thirteen?"
Langdon
asked.
"Whose
office
is
that?"
"Nobody's.
The
SBB
is
a
private
storage
area,
and
I
must
say,
I'm
puzzled
how
"Chief
Anderson,"
Sato
interrupted
without
looking
up
from
her
BlackBerry.
"Just
take
us
there,
please."
Anderson
clenched
his
jaw
and
guided
them
on
in
silence
through
what
was
now
feeling
like
a
hybrid
self-
storage
facility
and
epic
labyrinth.
On
almost
every
wall,
directional
signs
pointed
back
and
forth,
apparently
attempting
to
locate
specific
office
blocks
in
this
network
of
hallways.
S142toS152
ST1
to
ST70
HI
to
H166
&amp;
HT1
to
HT67
Langdon
doubted
he
could
ever
find
his
way
out
of
here
alone.
This
place
is
a
maze.
From
all
he
could
gather,
office
numbers
began
with
either
an
S
or
an
H
depending
on
whether
they
were
on
the
Senate
side
of
the
building
or
the
House
side.
Areas
designated
ST
and
HT
were
apparently
on
a
level
that
Anderson
called
Terrace
Level.
Still
no
signs
for
SBB.
Finally
they
arrived
at
a
heavy
steel
security
door
with
a
key-card
entry
box.
SB
Level
Langdon
sensed
they
were
getting
closer.
Anderson
reached
for
his
key
card
but
hesitated,
looking
uncomfortable
with
Sato's
demands.
"Chief,"
Sato
prompted.
"We
don't
have
all
night."
Anderson
reluctantly
inserted
his
key
card.
The
steel
door
released.
He
pushed
it
open,
and
they
stepped
through
into
the
foyer
beyond.
The
heavy
door
clicked
shut
behind
them.
Langdon
wasn't
sure
what
he
had
hoped
to
see
in
this
foyer,
but
the
sight
in
front
of
him
was
definitely
not
it.
He
was
staring
at
a
descending
stairway.
"Down
again?"
he
said,
stopping
short.
"There's
a
level
under
the
crypt?"
"Yes,"
Anderson
said.
"55
stands
for
'Senate
Basement.'
Langdon
groaned.
Terrific.
The
headlights
winding
up
the
SMSC's
wooded
access
road
were
the
first
the
guard
had
seen
in
the
last
hour.
Dutifully,
he
turned
down
the
volume
on
his
portable
TV
set
and
stashed
his
snacks
beneath
the
counter.
Lousy
timing.
The
Redskins
were
completing
their
opening
drive,
and
he
didn't
want
to
miss
it.
As
the
car
drew
closer,
the
guard
checked
the
name
on
the
notepad
in
front
of
him.
Dr.
Christopher
Abaddon.
Katherine
Solomon
had
just
called
to
alert
Security
of
this
guest's
imminent
arrival.
The
guard
had
no
idea
who
this
doctor
might
be,
but
he
was
apparently
very
good
at
doctoring;
he
was
arriving
in
a
black
stretch
limousine.
The
long,
sleek
vehicle
rolled
to
a
stop
beside
the
guardhouse,
and
the
driver's
tinted
window
lowered
silently.
"Good
evening,"
the
chauffeur
said,
doffing
his
cap.
He
was
a
powerfully
built
man
with
a
shaved
head.
He
was
listening
to
the
football
game
on
his
radio.
"I
have
Dr.
Christopher
Abaddon
for
Ms.
Katherine
Solomon?"
The
guard
nodded.
"Identification,
please."
The
chauffeur
looked
surprised.
"I'm
sorry,
didn't
Ms.
Solomon
call
ahead?"
The
guard
nodded,
stealing
a
glance
at
the
television.
"I'm
still
required
to
scan
and
log
visitor
identification.
Sorry,
regulations.
I'll
need
to
see
the
doctor's
ID."
"Not
a
problem."
The
chauffeur
turned
backward
in
his
seat
and
spoke
in
hushed
tones
through
the
privacy
screen.
As
he
did,
the
guard
stole
another
peek
at
the
game.
The
Redskins
were
breaking
from
the
huddle
now,
and
he
hoped
to
get
this
limo
through
before
the
next
play.
The
chauffeur
turned
forward
again
and
held
out
the
ID
that
he'd
apparently
just
received
through
the
privacy
screen.
The
guard
took
the
card
and
quickly
scanned
it
into
his
system.
The
D.C.
driver's
license
showed
one
Christopher
Abaddon
from
Kalorama
Heights.
The
photo
depicted
a
handsome
blond
gentleman
wearing
a
blue
blazer,
a
necktie,
and
a
satin
pocket
square.
Who
the
hell
wears
a
pocket
square
to
the
DMV?
A
muffled
cheer
went
up
from
the
television
set,
and
the
guard
wheeled
just
in
time
to
see
a
Redskins
player
dancing
in
the
end
zone,
his
finger
pointed
skyward.
"I
missed
it,"
the
guard
grumbled,
returning
to
the
window.
"Okay,"
he
said,
returning
the
license
to
the
chauffeur.
"You're
all
set."
As
the
limo
pulled
through,
the
guard
returned
to
his
TV,
hoping
for
a
replay.
As
Mal'akh
drove
his
limo
up
the
winding
access
road,
he
couldn't
help
but
smile.
Peter
Solomon's
secret
museum
had
been
simple
to
breach.
Sweeter
still,
tonight
was
the
second
time
in
twenty-four
hours
that
Mal'akh
had
broken
into
one
of
Solomon's
private
spaces.
Last
night,
a
similar
visit
had
been
made
to
Solomon's
home.
Although
Peter
Solomon
had
a
magnificent
country
estate
in
Potomac,
he
spent
much
of
his
time
in
the
city
at
his
penthouse
apartment
at
the
exclusive
Dorchester
Arms.
His
building,
like
most
that
catered
to
the
super-rich,
was
a
veritable
fortress.
High
walls.
Guard
gates.
Guest
lists.
Secured
underground
parking.
Mal'akh
had
driven
this
very
limousine
up
to
the
building's
guardhouse,
doffed
his
chauffeur's
cap
from
his
shaved
head,
and
proclaimed,
"I
have
Dr.
Christopher
Abaddon.
He
is
an
invited
guest
of
Mr.
Peter
Solomon."
Mal'akh
spoke
the
words
as
if
he
were
announcing
the
Duke
of
York.
The
guard
checked
a
log
and
then
Abaddon's
ID.
"Yes,
I
see
Mr.
Solomon
is
expecting
Dr.
Abaddon."
He
pressed
a
button
and
the
gate
opened.
"Mr.
Solomon
is
in
the
penthouse
apartment.
Have
your
guest
use
the
last
elevator
on
the
right.
It
goes
all
the
way
up."
"Thank
you."
Mal'akh
tipped
his
hat
and
drove
through.
As
he
wound
deep
into
the
garage,
he
scanned
for
security
cameras.
Nothing.
Apparently,
those
who
lived
here
were
neither
the
kind
of
people
who
broke
into
cars
nor
the
kind
of
people
who
appreciated
being
watched.
Mal'akh
parked
in
a
dark
corner
near
the
elevators,
lowered
the
divider
between
the
driver's
compartment
and
the
passenger
compartment,
and
slithered
through
the
opening
into
the
back
of
the
limo.
Once
in
back,
he
got
rid
of
his
chauffeur's
cap
and
donned
his
blond
wig.
Straightening
his
jacket
and
tie,
he
checked
the
mirror
to
make
sure
he
had
not
smeared
his
makeup.
Mal'akh
was
not
about
to
take
any
chances.
Not
tonight.
/
have
waited
too
long
for
this.
Seconds
later,
Mal'akh
was
stepping
into
the
private
elevator.
The
ride
to
the
top
was
silent
and
smooth.
When
the
door
opened,
he
found
himself
in
an
elegant,
private
foyer.
His
host
was
already
waiting.
"Dr.
Abaddon,
welcome."
Mal'akh
looked
into
the
man's
famous
gray
eyes
and
felt
his
heart
begin
to
race.
"Mr.
Solomon,
I
appreciate
your
seeing
me."
"Please,
call
me
Peter."
The
two
men
shook
hands.
As
Mal'akh
gripped
the
older
man's
palm,
he
saw
the
gold
Masonic
ring
on
Solomon's
hand
the
same
hand
that
had
once
aimed
a
gun
at
Mal'akh.
A
voice
whispered
from
Mal'akh's
distant
past.
If
you
pull
that
trigger,
I
will
haunt
you
forever.
"Please
come
in,"
Solomon
said,
ushering
Mal'akh
into
an
elegant
living
room
whose
expansive
windows
offered
an
astonishing
view
of
the
Washington
skyline.
"Do
I
smell
tea
steeping?"
Mal'akh
asked
as
he
entered.
Solomon
looked
impressed.
"My
parents
always
greeted
guests
with
tea.
I've
carried
on
that
tradition."
He
led
Mal'akh
into
the
living
room,
where
a
tea
service
was
waiting
in
front
of
the
fire.
"Cream
and
sugar?"
"Black,
thank
you."
Again
Solomon
looked
impressed.
"A
purist."
He
poured
them
both
a
cup
of
black
tea.
"You
said
you
needed
to
discuss
something
with
me
that
was
sensitive
in
nature
and
could
be
discussed
only
in
private."
"Thank
you.
I
appreciate
your
time."
"You
and
I
are
Masonic
brothers
now.
We
have
a
bond.
Tell
me
how
I
can
help
you."
"First,
I
would
like
to
thank
you
for
the
honor
of
the
thirty-third
degree
a
few
months
ago.
This
is
deeply
meaningful
to
me."
"I'm
glad,
but
please
know
that
those
decisions
are
not
mine
alone.
They
are
by
vote
of
the
Supreme
Council."
"Of
course."
Mal'akh
suspected
Peter
Solomon
had
probably
voted
against
him,
but
within
the
Masons,
as
with
all
things,
money
was
power.
Mal'akh,
after
achieving
the
thirty-second
degree
in
his
own
lodge,
had
waited
only
a
month
before
making
a
multimillion-dollar
donation
to
charity
in
the
name
of
the
Masonic
Grand
Lodge.
The
unsolicited
act
of
selflessness,
as
Mal'akh
anticipated,
was
enough
to
earn
him
a
quick
invitation
into
the
elite
thirty-third
degree.
And
yet
I
have
learned
no
secrets.
Despite
the
age-old
whispers
"All
is
revealed
at
the
thirty-third
degree"
Mal'akh
had
been
told
nothing
new,
nothing
of
relevance
to
his
quest.
But
he
had
never
expected
to
be
told.
The
inner
circle
of
Freemasonry
contained
smaller
circles
still
circles
Mal'akh
would
not
see
for
years,
if
ever.
He
didn't
care.
His
initiation
had
served
its
purpose.
Something
unique
had
happened
within
that
Temple
Room,
and
it
had
given
Mal'akh
power
over
all
of
them.
/
no
longer
play
by
your
rules.
"You
do
realize,"
Mal'akh
said,
sipping
his
tea,
"that
you
and
I
met
many
years
ago."
Solomon
looked
surprised.
"Really?
I
don't
recall."
"It
was
quite
a
long
time
ago."
And
Christopher
Abaddon
is
not
my
real
name.
"I'm
so
sorry.
My
mind
must
be
getting
old.
Remind
me
how
I
know
you?"
Mal'akh
smiled
one
last
time
at
the
man
he
hated
more
than
any
other
man
on
earth.
"It's
unfortunate
that
you
don't
recall."
In
one
fluid
motion,
Mal'akh
pulled
a
small
device
from
his
pocket
and
extended
it
outward,
driving
it
hard
into
the
man's
chest.
There
was
a
flash
of
blue
light,
the
sharp
sizzle
of
the
stun-gun
discharge,
and
a
gasp
of
pain
as
one
million
volts
of
electricity
coursed
through
Peter
Solomon's
body.
His
eyes
went
wide,
and
he
slumped
motionless
in
his
chair.
Mal'akh
stood
up
now,
towering
over
the
man,
salivating
like
a
lion
about
to
consume
his
injured
prey.
Solomon
was
gasping,
straining
to
breathe.
Mal'akh
saw
fear
in
his
victim's
eyes
and
wondered
how
many
people
had
ever
seen
the
great
Peter
Solomon
cower.
Mal'akh
savored
the
scene
for
several
long
seconds.
He
took
a
sip
of
tea,
waiting
for
the
man
to
catch
his
breath.
Solomon
was
twitching,
attempting
to
speak.
"Wh-why?"
he
finally
managed.
"Why
do
you
think?"
Mal'akh
demanded.
Solomon
looked
truly
bewildered.
"You
want
money?"
Money?
Mal'akh
laughed
and

"Then

you

You

me
tonight."
Solomon
struggled
to
lift
his
chin
so
he
could
look
Mal'akh
in
the
eye.
"I
don't
understand."
"No
more
lies!"
Mal'akh
shouted,
advancing
to
within
inches
of
the
paralyzed
man.
"I
know
what
is
hidden
here
in
Washington."
Solomon's
gray
eyes
were
defiant.
"I
have
no
idea
what
you're
talking
about!"
Mal'akh
took
another
sip
of
tea
and
set
the
cup
on
a
coaster.
"You
spoke
those
same
words
to
me
ten
years
ago,
on
the
night
of
your
mother's
death."
Solomon's
eyes
shot
wide
open.
"You
?"
"She
didn't
have
to
die.
If
you
had
given
me
what
I
demanded"
The
older
man's
face
contorted
in
a
mask
of
horrified
recognition
and
disbelief.
"I
warned
you,"
Mal'akh
said,
"if
you
pulled
the
trigger,
I
would
haunt
you
forever."
"But
you're"
Mal'akh
lunged,
driving
the
Taser
hard
into
Solomon's
chest
again.
There
was
another
flash
of
blue
light,
and
Solomon
went
completely
limp.
Mal'akh
put
the
Taser
back
in
his
pocket
and
calmly
finished
his
tea.
When
he
was
done,
he
dabbed
his
lips
with
a
monogrammed
linen
napkin
and
peered
down
at
his
victim.
"Shall
we
go?"
Solomon's
body
was
motionless,
but
his
eyes
were
wide
and
engaged.
Mal'akh
got
down
close
and
whispered
in
the
man's
ear.
"I'm
taking
you
to
a
place
where
only
truth
remains."
Without
another
word,
Mal'akh
wadded
up
the
monogrammed
napkin
and
stuffed
it
into
Solomon's
mouth.
Then
he
hoisted
the
limp
man
onto
his
broad
shoulders
and
headed
for
the
private
elevator.
On
his
way
out,
he
picked
up
Solomon's
iPhone
and
keys
from
the
hall
table.
Tonight
you
will
tell
me
all
your
secrets,

thought.
Including
why
you
left
me
for
dead
all
those
years
ago.
SB

Robert
Langdon's
claustrophobia
gripped
him
more
tightly
with
every
hastening
step
of
their
descent.
As
they
moved
deeper
into
the
building's
original
foundation,
the
air
became
heavy,
and
the
ventilation
seemed
nonexistent.
The
walls
down
here
were
an
uneven
blend
of
stone
and
yellow
brick.
Director
Sato
typed
on
her
BlackBerry
as
they
walked.
Langdon
sensed
a
suspicion
in
her
guarded
manner,
but
the
feeling
was
quickly
becoming
reciprocal.
Sato
still
hadn't
told
him
how
she
knew
Langdon
was
here
tonight.
An
issue
of
national
security?
He
had
a
hard
time
understanding
any
relation
between
ancient
mysticism
and
national
security.
Then
again,
he
had
a
hard
time
understanding
much
of
anything
about
this
situation.
Peter
Solomon
entrusted
me
with
a
talisman
a
deluded
lunatic
tricked
me
into
bringing
it
to
the
Capitol
and
wants
me
to
use
it
to
unlock
a
mystical
portal
possibly
in
a
room
called
SBB13.
Not
exactly
a
clear
picture.
As
they
pressed
on,
Langdon
tried
to
shake
from
his
mind
the
horrible
image
of
Peter's
tattooed
hand,
transformed
into
the
Hand
of
the
Mysteries.
The
gruesome
picture
was
accompanied
by
Peter's
voice:
The
Ancient
Mysteries,
Robert,
have
spawned
many
myths
but
that
does
not
mean
they
themselves
are
fiction.
Despite
a
career
studying
mystical
symbols
and
history,
Langdon
had
always
struggled
intellectually
with
the
idea
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries
and
their
potent
promise
of
apotheosis.
Admittedly,
the
historical
record
contained
indisputable
evidence
that
secret
wisdom
had
been
passed
down
through
the
ages,
apparently
having
come
out
of
the
Mystery
Schools
in
early
Egypt.
This
knowledge
moved
underground,
resurfacing
in
Renaissance
Europe,
where,
according
to
most
accounts,
it
was
entrusted
to
an
elite
group
of
scientists
within
the
walls
of
Europe's
premier
scientific
think
tank
the
Royal
Society
of
London
enigmatically
nicknamed
the
Invisible
College.
This
concealed
"college"
quickly
became
a
brain
trust
of
the
world's
most
enlightened
minds
those
of
Isaac
Newton,
Francis
Bacon,
Robert
Boyle,
and
even
Benjamin
Franklin.
Today,
the
list
of
modern
"fellows"
was
no
less
impressive
Einstein,
Hawking,
Bohr,
and
Celsius.
These
great
minds
had
all
made
quantum
leaps
in
human
understanding,
advances
that,
according
to
some,
were
the
result
of
their
exposure
to
ancient
wisdom
hidden
within
the
Invisible
College.
Langdon
doubted
this
was
true,
although
certainly
there
had
been
an
unusual
amount
of
"mystical
work"
taking
place
within
those
walls.
The
discovery
of
Isaac
Newton's
secret
papers
in
1936
had
stunned
the
world
by
revealing
Newton's
all-
consuming
passion
for
the
study
of
ancient
alchemy
and
mystical
wisdom.
Newton's
private
papers
included
a
handwritten
letter
to
Robert
Boyle
in
which
he
exhorted
Boyle
to
keep
"high
silence"
regarding
the
mystical
knowledge
they
had
learned.
"It
cannot
be
communicated,"
Newton
wrote,
"without
immense
damage
to
the
world."
The
meaning
of
this
strange
warning
was
still
being
debated
today.
"Professor,"
Sato
said
suddenly,
glancing
up
from
her
BlackBerry,
"despite
your
insistence
that
you
have
no
idea
why
you're
here
tonight,
perhaps
you
could
shed
light
on
the
meaning
of
Peter
Solomon's
ring."
"I
can
try,"
Langdon
said,
refocusing.
She
produced
the
specimen
bag
and
handed
it
to
Langdon.
"Tell
me
about
the
symbols
on
his
ring."
Langdon
examined
the
familiar
ring
as
they
moved
through
the
deserted
passageway.
Its
face
bore
the
image
of
a
double-headed
phoenix
holding
a
banner
proclaiming
ORDO
AB
CHAO,
and
its
chest
was
emblazoned
with
the
number
33.
"The
double-headed
phoenix
with
the
number
thirty-three
is
the
emblem
of
the
highest
Masonic
degree."
Technically,
this
prestigious
degree
existed
solely
within
the
Scottish
Rite.
Nonetheless,
the
rites
and
degrees
of
Masonry
were
a
complex
hierarchy
that
Langdon
had
no
desire
to
detail
for
Sato
tonight.
"Essentially,
the
thirty-third
degree
is
an
elite
honor
reserved
for
a
small
group
of
highly
accomplished
Masons.
All
the
other
degrees
can
be
attained
by
successful
completion
of
the
previous
degree,
but
ascension
to
the
thirty-third
degree
is
controlled.
It's
by
invitation
only."
"So
you
were
aware
that
Peter
Solomon
was
a
member
of
this
elite
inner
circle?"
"Of
course.
Membership
is
hardly
a
secret."
"And
he
is
their
highest-ranking
official?"
"Currently,
yes.
Peter
heads
the
Supreme
Council
Thirty-third
Degree,
which
is
the
governing
body
of
the
Scottish
Rite
in
America."
Langdon
always
loved
visiting
their
headquarters
the
House
of
the
Temple
a
classical
masterpiece
whose
symbolic
ornamentation
rivaled
that
of
Scotland's
Rosslyn
Chapel.
"Professor,
did
you
notice
the
engraving
on
the
ring's
band?
It
bears
the
words
'All
is
revealed
at
the
thirty-
third
degree.'
Langdon
nodded.
"It's
a
common
theme
in
Masonic
lore."
"Meaning,
I
assume,
that
if
a
Mason
is
admitted
to
this
highest
thirty-third
degree,
then
something
special
is
revealed
to
him?"
"Yes,
that's
the
lore,
but
probably
not
the
reality.
There's
always
been
conspiratorial
conjecture
that
a
select
few
within
this
highest
echelon
of
Masonry
are
made
privy
to
some
great
mystical
secret.
The
truth,
I
suspect,
is
probably
far
less
dramatic."
Peter
Solomon
often
made
playful
allusions
to
the
existence
of
a
precious
Masonic
secret,
but
Langdon
always
assumed
it
was
just
a
mischievous
attempt
to
coax
him
into
joining
the
brotherhood.
Unfortunately,
tonight's
events
had
been
anything
but
playful,
and
there
had
been
nothing
mischievous
about
the
seriousness
with
which
Peter
had
urged
Langdon
to
protect
the
sealed
package
in
his
daybag.
Langdon
glanced
forlornly
at
the
plastic
bag
containing
Peter's
gold
ring.
"Director,"
he
asked,
"would
you
mind
if
I
held
on
to
this?"
She
looked
over.
"Why?"
"It's
very
valuable
to
Peter,
and
I'd
like
to
return
it
to
him
tonight."
She
looked
skeptical.
"Let's
hope
you
get
that
chance."
"Thanks."
Langdon
pocketed
the
ring.
"Another
question,"
Sato
said
as
they
hastened
deeper
into
the
labyrinth.
"My
staff
said
that
while
cross-
checking
the
concepts
of
the
'thirty-third
degree'
and
'portal'
with
Masonry,
they
turned
up
literally
hundreds
of
references
to
a
'
pyramid
'?"
"That's
not
surprising,
either,"
Langdon
said.
"The
pyramid
builders
of
Egypt
are
the
forerunners
of
the
modern
stonemasons,
and
the
pyramid,
along
with
Egyptian
themes,
is
very
common
in
Masonic
symbolism."
"Symbolizing
what?"
"The
pyramid
essentially
represents
enlightenment.
It's
an
architectural
symbol
emblematic
of
ancient
man's
ability
to
break
free
from
his
earthly
plane
and
ascend
upward
toward
heaven,
toward
the
golden
sun,
and
ultimately,
toward
the
supreme
source
of
illumination."
She
waited
a
moment.
"Nothing
else?"
Nothing
else?!
Langdon
had
just
described
one
of
history's
most
elegant
symbols.
The
structure
through
which
man
elevated
himself
into
the
realm
of
the
gods.
"According
to
my
staff,"
she
said,
"it
sounds
like
there
is
a
much
more
relevant
connection
tonight.
They
tell
me
there
exists
a
popular
legend
about
a
specific
pyramid
here
in
Washington
a
pyramid
that
relates
specifically
to
the
Masons
and
the
Ancient
Mysteries?"
Langdon
now
realized
what
she
was
referring
to,
and
he
tried
to
dispel
the
notion
before
they
wasted
any
more
time.
"I
am
familiar
with
the
legend,
Director,
but
it's
pure
fantasy.
The
Masonic
Pyramid
is
one
of
D.C.'s
most
enduring
myths,
probably
stemming
from
the
pyramid
on
the
Great
Seal
of
the
United
States."
"Why
didn't
you
mention
it
earlier?"
Langdon
shrugged.
"Because
it
has
no
basis
in
fact.
Like
I
said,
it's
a
myth.
One
of
many
associated
with
the
Masons."
"And
yet
this
particular
myth
relates
directly
to
the
Ancient
Mysteries?"
"Sure,
as
do
plenty
of
others.
The
Ancient
Mysteries
are
the
foundation
for
countless
legends
that
have
survived
in
history
stories
about
powerful
wisdom
protected
by
secret
guardians
like
the
Templars,
the
Rosicrucians,
the
Illuminati,
the
Alumbrados
the
list
goes
on
and
on.
They
are
all
based
on
the
Ancient
Mysteries
and
the
Masonic
Pyramid
is
just
one
example."
"I
see,"
Sato
said.
"And
what
does
this
legend
actually
say?"
Langdon
considered
it
for
a
few
steps
and
then
replied,
"Well,
I'm
no
specialist
in
conspiracy
theory,
but
I
am
educated
in
mythology,
and
most
accounts
go
something
like
this:
The
Ancient
Mysteries
the
lost
wisdom
of
the
ages
have
long
been
considered
mankind's
most
sacred
treasure,
and
like
all
great
treasures,
they
have
been
carefully
protected.
The
enlightened
sages
who
understood
the
true
power
of
this
wisdom
learned
to
fear
its
awesome
potential.
They
knew
that
if
this
secret
knowledge
were
to
fall
into
uninitiated
hands,
the
results
could
be
devastating;
as
we
said
earlier,
powerful
tools
can
be
used
either
for
good
or
for
evil.
So,
in
order
to
protect
the
Ancient
Mysteries,
and
mankind
in
the
process,
the
early
practitioners
formed
secret
fraternities.
Inside
these
brotherhoods,
they
shared
their
wisdom
only
with
the
properly
initiated,
passing
the
wisdom
from
sage
to
sage.
Many
believe
we
can
look
back
and
see
the
historical
remnants
of
those
who
mastered
the
Mysteries
in
the
stories
of
sorcerers,
magicians,
and
healers."
"And
the
Masonic
Pyramid?"
Sato
asked.
"How
does
that
fit
in?"
"Well,"
Langdon
said,
striding
faster
now
to
keep
pace,
"this
is
where
history
and
myth
begin
to
merge.
According
to
some
accounts,
by
the
sixteenth
century
in
Europe,
almost
all
of
these
secret
fraternities
had
become
extinct,
most
of
them
exterminated
by
a
growing
tide
of
religious
persecution.
The
Freemasons,
it
is
said,
became
the
last
surviving
custodians
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries.
Understandably,
they
feared
that
if
their
own
brotherhood
one
day
died
off
like
its
predecessors,
the
Ancient
Mysteries
would
be
lost
for
all
time."
"And
the
pyramidT
Sato
again
pressed.
Langdon
was
getting
to
it.
"The
legend
of
the
Masonic
Pyramid
is
quite
simple.
It
states
that
the
Masons,
in
order
to
fulfill
their
responsibility
of
protecting
this
great
wisdom
for
future
generations,
decided
to
hide
it
in
a
great
fortress."
Langdon
tried
to
gather
his
recollections
of
the
story.
"Again,
I
stress
this
is
all
myth,
but
allegedly,
the
Masons
transported
their
secret
wisdom
from
the
Old
World
to
the
New
World
here,
to
America
a
land
they
hoped
would
remain
free
from
religious
tyranny.
And
here
they
built
an
impenetrable
fortress
a
hidden
pyramid
designed
to
protect
the
Ancient
Mysteries
until
the
time
that
all
of
mankind
was
ready
to
handle
the
awesome
power
that
this
wisdom
could
communicate.
According
to
the
myth,
the
Masons
crowned
their
great
pyramid
with
a
shining,
solid-gold
capstone
as
symbol
of
the
precious
treasure
within
the
ancient
wisdom
capable
of
empowering
mankind
to
his
full
human
potential.
Apotheosis."
"Quite
a
story,"
Sato
said.
"Yes.
The
Masons
fall
victim
to
all
kinds
of
crazy
legends."
"Obviously
you
don't
believe
such
a
pyramid
exists."
"Of
course
not,"
Langdon
replied.
"There'
s
no
evidence
whatsoever
to
suggest
that
our
Masonic
forefathers
built
any
kind
of
pyramid
in
America,
much
less
in
D.C.
It's
pretty
difficult
to
hide
a
pyramid,
especially
one
large
enough
to
hold
all
the
lost
wisdom
of
the
ages."
The
legend,
as
Langdon
recalled,
never
explained
exactly
what
was
supposed
to
be
inside
the
Masonic
Pyramid
whether
it
was
ancient
texts,
occult
writings,
scientific
revelations,
or
something
far
more
mysterious
but
the
legend
did
say
that
the
precious
information
inside
was
ingeniously
encoded
and
understandable
only
to
the
most
enlightened
souls.
"Anyway,"
Langdon
said,
"this
story
falls
into
a
category
we
symbologists
call
an
'archetypal
hybrid'
a
blend
of
other
classic
legends,
borrowing
so
many
elements
from
popular
mythology
that
it
could
only
be
a
fictional
construct
not
historical
fact."
When
Langdon
taught
his
students
about
archetypal
hybrids,
he
used
the
example
of
fairy
tales,
which
were
recounted
across
generations
and
exaggerated
over
time,
borrowing
so
heavily
from
one
another
that
they
evolved
into
homogenized
morality
tales
with
the
same
iconic
elements
virginal
damsels,
handsome
princes,
impenetrable
fortresses,
and
powerful
wizards.
By
way
of
fairy
tales,
this
primeval
battle
of
"good
vs.
evil"
is
ingrained
into
us
as
children
through
our
stories:
Merlin
vs.
Morgan
le
Fay,
Saint
George
vs.
the
Dragon,
David
vs.
Goliath,
Snow
White
vs.
the
Witch,
and
even
Luke
Skywalker
battling
Darth
Vader.
Sato
scratched
her
head
as
they
turned
a
corner
and
followed
Anderson
down
a
short
flight
of
stairs.
"Tell
me
this.
If
I'm
not
mistaken,
pyramids
were
once
considered
mystical
portals
through
which
the
deceased
pharaohs
could
ascend
to
the
gods,
were
they
not?"
"True."
Sato
stopped
short
and
caught
Langdon'
s
arm,
glaring
up
at
him
with
an
expression
somewhere
between
surprise
and
disbelief.
"You're
saying
Peter
Solomon's
captor
told
you
to
find
a
hidden
portal,
and
it
didn't
occur
to
you
that
he
was
talking
about
the
Masonic
Pyramid
from
this
legend?"
"By
any
name,
the
Masonic
Pyramid
is
a
fairy
tale.
It's
purely
fantasy."
Sato
stepped
closer
to
him
now,
and
Langdon
could
smell
her
cigarette
breath.
"I
understand
your
position
on
that,
Professor,
but
for
the
sake
of
my
investigation,
the
parallel
is
hard
to
ignore.
A
portal
leading
to
secret
knowledge?
To
my
ear,
this
sounds
a
lot
like
what
Peter
Solomon's
captor
claims
you,
alone,
can
unlock."
"Well,
I
can
hardly
believe
"What
you
believe
is
not
the
point.
No
matter
what
you
believe,
you
must
concede
that
this
man
might
himselfbelieve
that
the
Masonic
Pyramid
is
real."
"The
man's
a
lunatic!
He
may
well
believe
that
SBB
Thirteen
is
the
entrance
to
a
giant
underground
pyramid
that
contains
all
the
lost
wisdom
of
the
ancients!"
Sato
stood
perfectly
still,
her
eyes
seething.
"The
crisis
I
am
facing
tonight
is
not
a
fairy
tale,
Professor.
It
is
quite
real,
I
assure
you."
A
cold
silence
hung
between
them.
"Ma'am?"
Anderson
finally
said,
gesturing
to
another
secure
door
ten
feet
away.
"We're
almost
there,
if
you'd
like
to
continue."
Sato
finally
broke
eye
contact
with
Langdon,
motioning
for
Anderson
to
move
on.
They
followed
the
security
chief
through
the
secure
doorway,
which
deposited
them
in
a
narrow
passage.
Langdon
looked
left
and
then
right.
You
've
got
to
be
kidding.
He
was
standing
in
the
longest
hallway
he
had
ever
seen.
Trish
Dunne
felt
the
familiar
surge
of
adrenaline
as
she
exited
the
bright
lights
of
the
Cube
and
moved
into
the
raw
darkness
of
the
void.
The
SMSC's
front
gate
had
just
called
to
say
that
Katherine's
guest,
Dr.
Abaddon,
had
arrived
and
required
an
escort
back
to
Pod
5.
Trish
had
offered
to
bring
him
back,
mostly
out
of
curiosity.
Katherine
had
said
very
little
about
the
man
who
would
be
visiting
them,
and
Trish
was
intrigued.
The
man
was
apparently
someone
Peter
Solomon
trusted
deeply;
the
Solomons
never
invited
anyone
back
to
the
Cube.
This
was
a
first.
/
hope
he
handles
the
crossing
okay,
Trish
thought
as
she
moved
through
the
frigid
darkness.
The
last
thing
she
needed
was
Katherine's
VIP
panicking
when
he
realized
what
he
had
to
do
to
get
to
the
lab.
The
first
time
is
always
the
worst.
Trish'
s
first
time
had
been
about
a
year
ago.
She
had
accepted
Katherine's
job
offer,
signed
a
nondisclosure,
and
then
come
to
the
SMSC
with
Katherine
to
see
the
lab.
The
two
women
had
walked
the
length
of
"The
Street,"
arriving
at
a
metal
door
marked
POD
5.
Even
though
Katherine
had
tried
to
prepare
her
by
describing
the
lab's
remote
location,
Trish
was
not
ready
for
what
she
saw
when
the
pod
door
hissed
open.
The
void.
Katherine
stepped
over
the
threshold,
walked
a
few
feet
into
the
perfect
blackness,
and
then
motioned
for
Trish
to
follow.
"Trust
me.
You
won't
get
lost."
Trish
pictured
herself
wandering
in
a
pitch-black,
stadium-size
room
and
broke
a
sweat
at
the
mere
thought.
"We
have
a
guidance
system
to
keep
you
on
track."
Katherine
pointed
to
the
floor.
"Very
low-tech."
Trish
squinted
through
the
darkness
at
the
rough
cement
floor.
It
took
a
moment
to
see
it
in
the
darkness,
but
there
was
a
narrow
carpet
runner
that
had
been
laid
down
in
a
straight
line.
The
carpet
ran
like
a
roadway,
disappearing
into
the
darkness.
"See
with
your
feet,"
Katherine
said,
turning
and
walking
off.
"Just
follow
right
behind
me."
As
Katherine
disappeared
into
the
blackness,
Trish
swallowed
her
fear
and
followed.
This
is
insane!
She
had
taken
only
a
few
steps
down
the
carpet
when
the
Pod
5
door
swung
shut
behind
her,
snuffing
out
the
last
faint
hint
of
light.
Pulse
racing,
Trish
turned
all
of
her
attention
to
the
feeling
of
the
carpet
beneath
her
feet.
She
had
ventured
only
a
handful
of
steps
down
the
soft
runner
when
she
felt
the
side
of
her
right
foot
hit
hard
cement.
Startled,
she
instinctively
corrected
to
the
left,
getting
both
feet
back
on
soft
carpet.
Katherine's
voice
materialized
up
ahead
in
the
blackness,
her
words
almost
entirely
swallowed
by
the
lifeless
acoustics
of
this
abyss.
"The
human
body
is
amazing,"
she
said.
"If
you
deprive
it
of
one
sensory
input,
the
other
senses
take
over,
almost
instantly.
Right
now,
the
nerves
in
your
feet
are
literally
'tuning'
themselves
to
become
more
sensitive."
Good
thing,
Trish
thought,
correcting
course
again.
They
walked
in
silence
for
what
seemed
entirely
too
long.
"How
much
farther?"
Trish
finally
asked.
"We're
about
halfway."
Katherine's
voice
sounded
more
distant
now.
Trish
sped
up,
doing
her
best
to
stay
composed,
but
the
breadth
of
the
darkness
felt
like
it
would
engulf
her.
/
can
't
see
one
millimeter
in
front
of
my
face!
"Katherine?
How
do
you
know
when
to
stop
walking?"
"You'll
know
in
a
moment,"
Katherine
said.
That
was
a
year
ago,
and
now,
tonight,
Trish
was
once
again
in
the
void,
heading
in
the
opposite
direction,
out
to
the
lobby
to
retrieve
her
boss's
guest.
A
sudden
change
in
carpet
texture
beneath
her
feet
alerted
her
that
she
was
three
yards
from
the
exit.
The
warning
track,
as
it
was
called
by
Peter
Solomon,
an
avid
baseball
fan.
Trish
stopped
short,
pulled
out
her
key
card,
and
groped
in
the
darkness
along
the
wall
until
she
found
the
raised
slot
and
inserted
her
card.
The
door
hissed
open.
Trish
squinted
into
the
welcoming
light
of
the
SMSC
hallway.
Made
it
again.
Moving
through
the
deserted
corridors,
Trish
found
herself
thinking
about
the
bizarre
redacted
file
they
had
found
on
a
secure
network.
Ancient
portal?
Secret
location
underground?
She
wondered
if
Mark
Zoubianis
was
having
any
luck
figuring
out
where
the
mysterious
document
was
located.
Inside
the
control
room,
Katherine
stood
in
the
soft
glow
of
the
plasma
wall
and
gazed
up
at
the
enigmatic
document
they
had
uncovered.
She
had
isolated
her
key
phrases
now
and
felt
increasingly
certain
that
the
document
was
talking
about
the
same
far-flung
legend
that
her
brother
had
apparently
shared
with
Dr.
Abaddon.

to

the
rest
of

Katherine
thought.
She
stared
a
moment
longer
and
then
flipped
the
plasma
wall's
power
switch.
Katherine
always
turned
off
this
energy-intensive
display
so
as
not
to
waste
the
fuel
cell's
liquid
hydrogen
reserves.
She
watched
as
her
keywords
slowly
faded,
collapsing
down
into
a
tiny
white
dot,
which
hovered
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
and
then
finally
twinkled
out.
She
turned
and
walked
back
toward
her
office.
Dr.
Abaddon
would
be
arriving
momentarily,
and
she
wanted
to
make
him
feel
welcome.
"Almost
there,"
Anderson
said,
guiding
Langdon
and
Sato
down
the
seemingly
endless
corridor
that
ran
the
entire
length
of
the
Capitol's
eastern
foundation.
"In
Lincoln's
day,
this
passage
had
a
dirt
floor
and
was
filled
with
rats."
Langdon
felt
grateful
the
floor
had
been
tiled;
he
was
not
a
big
fan
of
rats.
The
group
continued
on,
their
footfalls
drumming
up
an
eerie,
uneven
echo
in
the
long
passageway.
Doorways
lined
the
long
hallway,
some
closed
but
many
ajar.
Many
of
the
rooms
down
on
this
level
looked
abandoned.
Langdon
noticed
the
numbers
on
the
doors
were
now
descending
and,
after
a
while,
seemed
to
be
running
out.
SB4
SB3
SB2
SB1
They
continued
past
an
unmarked
door,
but
Anderson
stopped
short
when
the
numbers
began
ascending
again.
HB1
HB2
"Sorry,"
Anderson
said.
"Missed
it.
I
almost
never
come
down
this
deep."
The
group
backed
up
a
few
yards
to
an
old
metal
door,
which
Langdon
now
realized
was
located
at
the
hallway's
central
point
the
meridian
that
divided
the
Senate
Basement
(SB)
and
the
House
Basement
(HB).
As
it
turned
out,
the
door
was
indeed
marked,
but
its
engraving
was
so
faded,
it
was
almost
imperceptible.
SBB
"Here
we
are,"
Anderson
said.
"Keys
will
be
arriving
any
moment."
Sato
frowned
and
checked
her
watch.
Langdon
eyed
the
SBB
marking
and
asked
Anderson,
"Why
is
this
space
associated
with
the
Senate
side
even
though
it's
in
the
middle?"
Anderson
looked
puzzled.
"What
do
you
mean?"
"It
says
SBB,
which
begins
with
an
S,
not
an
H."
Anderson
shook
his
head.
"The
S
in
SBB
doesn't
stand
for
Senate.
It
"Chief?"
a
guard
called
out
in
the
distance.
He
came
jogging
up
the
hallway
toward
them,
holding
out
a
key.
"Sorry,
sir,
it
took
a
few
minutes.
We
couldn't
locate
the
main
SBB
key.
This
is
a
spare
from
an
auxiliary
box."
"The
original
is
missing?"
Anderson
said,
sounding
surprised.
"Probably
lost,"
the
guard
replied,
arriving
out
of
breath.
"Nobody
has
requested
access
down
here
for
ages."
Anderson
took
the
key.
"No
secondary
key
for
SBB
Thirteen?"
"Sorry,
so
far
we're
not
finding
keys
for
any
of
the
rooms
in
the
SBB.
MacDonald'
s
on
it
now."
The
guard
pulled
out
his
radio
and
spoke
into
it.
"Bob?
I'm
with
the
chief.
Any
additional
info
yet
on
the
key
for
SBB
Thirteen?"
The
guard's
radio
crackled,
and
a
voice
replied,
"Actually,
yeah.
It's
strange.
I'm
seeing
no
entries
since
we
computerized,
but
the
hard
logs
indicate
all
the
storage
rooms
in
the
SBB
were
cleaned
out
and
abandoned
more
than
twenty
years
ago.
They're
now
listed
as
unused
space."
He
paused.
"All
except
for
SBB
Thirteen."
Anderson
grabbed
the
radio.
"This
is
the
chief.
What
do
you
mean,
all
except
SBB
Thirteen?"
"Well,
sir,"
the
voice
replied,
"I've
got
a
handwritten
notation
here
that
designates
SBB
Thirteen
as
'private.'
It
was
a
long
time
ago,
but
it's
written
and
initialed
by
the
Architect
himself."
The
term
Architect,
Langdon
knew,
was
not
a
reference
to
the
man
who
had
designed
the
Capitol,
but
rather
to
the
man
who
ran
it.
Similar
to
a
building
manager,
the
man
appointed
as
Architect
of
the
Capitol
was
in
charge
of
everything
including
maintenance,
restoration,
security,
hiring
personnel,
and
assigning
offices.
"The
strange
thing"
the
voice
on
the
radio
said,
"is
that
the
Architect's
notation
indicates
that
this
'private
space'
was
set
aside
for
the
use
of
Peter
Solomon."
Langdon,
Sato,
and
Anderson
all
exchanged
startled
looks.
"I'm
guessing,
sir,"
the
voice
continued,
"that
Mr.
Solomon
has
our
primary
key
to
the
SBB
as
well
as
any
keys
to
SBB
Thirteen."
Langdon
could
not
believe
his
ears.
Peter
has
a
private
room
in
the
basement
of
the
Capitol?
He
had
always
known
Peter
Solomon
had
secrets,
but
this
was
surprising
even
to
Langdon.
"Okay,"
Anderson
said,
clearly
unamused.
"We're
hoping
to
get
access
to
SBB
Thirteen
specifically,
so
keep
looking
for
a
secondary
key."
"Will
do,
sir.
We're
also
working
on
the
digital
image
that
you
requested
"Thank
you,"
Anderson
interrupted,
pressing
the
talk
button
and
cutting
him
off.
"That
will
be
all.
Send
that
file
to
Director
Sato's
BlackBerry
as
soon
as
you
have
it."
"Understood,
sir."
The
radio
went
silent.
Anderson
handed
the
radio
back
to
the
guard
in
front
of
them.
The
guard
pulled
out
a
photocopy
of
a
blueprint
and
handed
it
to
his
chief.
"Sir,
the
SBB
is
in
gray,
and
we've
notated
with
an
X
which
room
is
SBB
Thirteen,
so
it
shouldn't
be
hard
to
find.
The
area
is
quite
small."
Anderson
thanked
the
guard
and
turned
his
focus
to
the
blueprint
as
the
young
man
hurried
off.
Langdon
looked
on,
surprised
to
see
the
astonishing
number
of
cubicles
that
made
up
the
bizarre
maze
beneath
the
U.S.
Capitol.
Anderson
studied
the
blueprint
for
a
moment,
nodded,
and
then
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket.
Turning
to
the
door
marked
SBB,
he
raised
the
key,
but
hesitated,
looking
uneasy
about
opening
it.
Langdon
felt
similar
misgivings;
he
had
no
idea
what
was
behind
this
door,
but
he
was
quite
certain
that
whatever
Solomon
had
hidden
down
here,
he
wanted
to
keep
private.
Very
private.
Sato
cleared
her
throat,
and
Anderson
got
the
message.
The
chief
took
a
deep
breath,
inserted
the
key,
and
tried
to
turn
it.
The
key
didn't
move.
For
a
split
second,
Langdon
felt
hopeful
the
key
was
wrong.
On
the
second
try,
though,
the
lock
turned,
and
Anderson
heaved
the
door
open.
As
the
heavy
door
creaked
outward,
damp
air
rushed
out
into
the
corridor.
Langdon
peered
into
the
darkness
but
could
see
nothing
at
all.
"Professor,"
Anderson
said,
glancing
back
at
Langdon
as
he
groped
blindly
for
a
light
switch.
"To
answer
your
question,
the
S
in
SBB
doesn't
stand
for
Senate.
It
stands
for
sub."
"Sub?"
Langdon
asked,
puzzled.
Anderson
nodded
and
flicked
the
switch
just
inside
the
door.
A
single
bulb
illuminated
an
alarmingly
steep
staircase
descending
into
inky
blackness.
"SBB
is
the
Capitol's
subbasement."
Systems
security
specialist
Mark
Zoubianis
was
sinking
deeper
into
his
futon
and
scowling
at
the
information
on
his
laptop
screen.
What
the
hell
kind
of
address
is
this?
His
best
hacking
tools
were
entirely
ineffective
at
breaking
into
the
document
or
at
unmasking
Trish's
mysterious
IP
address.
Ten
minutes
had
passed,
and
Zoubianis's
program
was
still
pounding
away
in
vain
at
the
network
firewalls.
They
showed
little
hope
of
penetration.
No
wonder
they're
overpaying
me.
He
was
about
to
retool
and
try
a
different
approach
when
his
phone
rang.
Trish,
for
Christ's
sake,
I
said
I'd
call
you.
He
muted
the
football
game
and
answered.
"Yeah?"
"Is
this
Mark
Zoubianis?"
a
man
asked.
"At
357
Kingston
Drive
in
Washington?"
Zoubianis
could
hear
other
muffled
conversations
in
the
background.
A
telemarketer
during
the
play-offs?
Are
they
insane?
"Let
me
guess,
I
won
a
week
in
Anguilla?"
"No,"
the
voice
replied
with
no
trace
of
humor.
"This
is
systems
security
for
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency.
We
would
like
to
know
why
you
are
attempting
to
hack
one
of
our
classified
databases?"
Three
stories
above
the
Capitol
Building's
subbasement,
in
the
wide-open
spaces
of
the
visitor
center,
security
guard
Nunez
locked
the
main
entry
doors
as
he
did
every
night
at
this
time.
As
he
headed
back
across
the
expansive
marble
floors,
he
thought
of
the
man
in
the
army-surplus
jacket
with
the
tattoos.
/
let
him
in.
Nunez
wondered
if
he
would
have
a
job
tomorrow.
As
he
headed
toward
the
escalator,
a
sudden
pounding
on
the
outside
doors
caused
him
to
turn.
He
squinted
back
toward
the
main
entrance
and
saw
an
elderly
African
American
man
outside,
rapping
on
the
glass
with
his
open
palm
and
motioning
to
be
let
in.
Nunez
shook
his
head
and
pointed
to
his
watch.
The
man
pounded
again
and
stepped
into
the
light.
He
was
immaculately
dressed
in
a
blue
suit
and
had
close-
cropped
graying
hair.
Nunez's
pulse
quickened.
Holy
shit.
Even
at
a
distance,
Nunez
now
recognized
who
this
man
was.
He
hurried
back
to
the
entrance
and
unlocked
the
door.
"I'm
sorry,
sir.
Please,
please
come
in."
Warren
Bellamy
Architect
of
the
Capitol
stepped
across
the
threshold
and
thanked
Nunez
with
a
polite
nod.
Bellamy
was
lithe
and
slender,
with
an
erect
posture
and
piercing
gaze
that
exuded
the
confidence
of
a
man
in
full
control
of
his
surroundings.
For
the
last
twenty-five
years,
Bellamy
had
served
as
the
supervisor
of
the
U.S.
Capitol.
"May
I
help
you,
sir?"
Nunez
asked.
"Thank
you,
yes."
Bellamy
enunciated
his
words
with
crisp
precision.
As
a
northeastern
Ivy
League
graduate,
his
diction
was
so
exacting
he
sounded
almost
British.
"I've
just
learned
that
you
had
an
incident
here
this
evening."
He
looked
deeply
concerned.
"Yes,
sir.
It
was"
"Where's
Chief
Anderson?"
"Downstairs
with
Director
Sato
from
the
CIA's
Office
of
Security."
Bellamy's
eyes
widened
with
concern.
"The
CIA
is
here?"
"Yes,
sir.
Director
Sato
arrived
almost
immediately
after
the
incident."
"Why?"
Bellamy
demanded.
Nunez
shrugged.
As
if
I
was
going
to
ask?
Bellamy
strode
directly
toward
the
escalators.
"Where
are
they?"
"They
just
went
to
the
lower
levels."
Nunez
hastened
after
him.
Bellamy
glanced
back
with
a
look
of
concern.
"Downstairs?
Why?"
"I
don't
really
know
I
just
heard
it
on
my
radio."
Bellamy
was
moving
faster
now.
"Take
me
to
them
right
away."
"Yes,
sir."
As
the
two
men
hurried
across
the
open
expanse,
Nunez
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
large
golden
ring
on
Bellamy's
finger.
Nunez
pulled
out
his
radio.
"I'll
alert
the
chief
that
you're
coming
down."
"No."
Bellamy's
eyes
flashed
dangerously.
"I'd
prefer
to
be
unannounced."
Nunez
had
made
some
big
mistakes
tonight,
but
failing
to
alert
Chief
Anderson
that
the
Architect
was
now
in
the
building
would
be
his
last.
"Sir?"
he
said,
uneasy.
"I
think
Chief
Anderson
would
prefer
"You
are
aware
that
I
employ
Mr.
Anderson?"
Bellamy
said.
Nunez
nodded.
"Then
I
think
he
would
prefer
you
obey
my
wishes."
Trish
Dunne
entered
the
SMSC
lobby
and
looked
up
with
surprise.
The
guest
waiting
here
looked
nothing
like
the
usual
bookish,
flannel-clad
doctors
who
entered
this
building
those
of
anthropology,
oceanography,
geology,
and
other
scientific
fields.
Quite
to
the
contrary,
Dr.
Abaddon
looked
almost
aristocratic
in
his
impeccably
tailored
suit.
He
was
tall,
with
a
broad
torso,
well-tanned
face,
and
perfectly
combed
blond
hair
that
gave
Trish
the
impression
he
was
more
accustomed
to
luxuries
than
to
laboratories.
"Dr.
Abaddon,
I
presume?"
Trish
said,
extending
her
hand.
The
man
looked
uncertain,
but
he
took
Trish's
plump
hand
in
his
broad
palm.
"I'm
sorry.
And
you
are?"
"Trish
Dunne,"
she
replied.
"I'm
Katherine's
assistant.
She
asked
me
to
escort
you
back
to
her
lab."
"Oh,
I
see."
The
man
smiled
now.
"Very
nice
to
meet
you,
Trish.
My
apologies
if
I
seemed
confused.
I
was
under
the
impression
Katherine
was
here
alone
this
evening."
He
motioned
down
the
hall.
"But
I'm
all
yours.
Lead
the
way."
Despite
the
man's
quick
recovery,
Trish
had
seen
the
flash
of
disappointment
in
his
eyes.
She
now
suspected
the
motive
for
Katherine's
secrecy
earlier
about
Dr.
Abaddon.
A
budding
romance,
maybe?
Katherine
never
discussed
her
social
life,
but
her
visitor
was
attractive
and
well-groomed,
and
although
younger
than
Katherine,
he
clearly
came
from
her
world
of
wealth
and
privilege.
Nonetheless,
whatever
Dr.
Abaddon
had
imagined
tonight's
visit
might
entail,
Trish's
presence
did
not
seem
to
be
part
of
his
plan.
At
the
lobby's
security
checkpoint,
a
lone
guard
quickly
pulled
off
his
headphones,
and
Trish
could
hear
the
Redskins
game
blaring.
The
guard
put
Dr.
Abaddon
through
the
usual
visitor
routine
of
metal
detectors
and
temporary
security
badges.
"Who's
winning?"
Dr.
Abaddon
said
affably
as
he
emptied
his
pockets
of
a
cell
phone,
some
keys,
and
a
cigarette
lighter.
"Skins
by
three,"
the
guard
said,
sounding
eager
to
get
back.
"Helluva
game."
"Mr.
Solomon
will
be
arriving
shortly,"
Trish
told
the
guard.
"Would
you
please
send
him
back
to
the
lab
once
he
arrives?"
"Will
do."
The
guard
gave
an
appreciative
wink
as
they
passed
through.
"Thanks
for
the
heads-up.
I'll
look
busy."
Trish's
comment
had
been
not
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
guard
but
also
to
remind
Dr.
Abaddon
that
Trish
was
not
the
only
one
intruding
on
his
private
evening
here
with
Katherine.
"So
how
do
you
know
Katherine?"
Trish
asked,
glancing
up
at
the
mysterious
guest.
Dr.
Abaddon
chuckled.
"Oh,
it's
a
long
story.
We've
been
working
on
something
together."
Understood,
Trish
thought.
None
of
my
business.
"This
is
an
amazing
facility,"
Abaddon
said,
glancing
around
as
they
moved
down
the
massive
corridor.
"I've
never
actually
been
here."
His
airy
tone
was
becoming
more
genial
with
every
step,
and
Trish
noticed
he
was
actively
taking
it
all
in.
In
the
bright
lights
of
the
hallway,
she
also
noticed
that
his
face
looked
like
he
had
a
fake
tan.
Odd.
Nonetheless,
as
they
navigated
the
deserted
corridors,
Trish
gave
him
a
general
synopsis
of
the
SMSC's
purpose
and
function,
including
the
various
pods
and
their
contents.
The
visitor
looked
impressed.
"Sounds
like
this
place
has
a
treasure
trove
of
priceless
artifacts.
I
would
have
expected
guards
posted
everywhere."
"No
need,"
Trish
said,
motioning
to
the
row
of
fish-eye
lenses
lining
the
ceiling
high
above.
"Security
here
is
automated.
Every
inch
of
this
corridor
is
recorded
twenty-four/seven,
and
this
corridor
is
the
spine
of
the
facility.
It's
impossible
to
access
any
of
the
rooms
off
this
corridor
without
a
key
card
and
PIN
number."
"Efficient
use
of
cameras."
"Knock
on
wood,
we've
never
had
a
theft.
Then
again,
this
is
not
the
kind
of
museum
anyone
would
rob
there's
not
much
call
on
the
black
market
for
extinct
flowers,
Inuit
kayaks,
or
giant
squid
carcasses."
Dr.
Abaddon
chuckled.
"I
suppose
you're
right."
"Our
biggest
security
threat
is
rodents
and
insects."
Trish
explained
how
the
building
prevented
insect
infestations
by
freezing
all
SMSC
refuse
and
also
by
an
architectural
feature
called
a
"dead
zone"
an
inhospitable
compartment
between
double
walls,
which
surrounded
the
entire
building
like
a
sheath.
"Incredible,"
Abaddon
said.
"So,
where
is
Katherine
and
Peter's
lab?"
"Pod
Five,"
Trish
said.
"It's
all
the
way
at
the
end
of
this
hallway."
Abaddon
halted
suddenly,
spinning
to
his
right,
toward
a
small
window.
"My
word!
Will
you
look
at
thatl"
Trish
laughed.
"Yeah,
that's
Pod
Three.
They
call
it
Wet
Pod."
"Wet?"
Abaddon
said,
face
pressed
to
the
glass.
"There
are
over
three
thousand
gallons
of
liquid
ethanol
in
there.
Remember
the
giant
squid
carcass
I
mentioned
earlier?"
"That's
the
squid?!"
Dr.
Abaddon
turned
from
the
window
momentarily,
his
eyes
wide.
"It's
huge!"
"A
female
Architeuthis,"
Trish
said.
"She's
over
forty
feet."
Dr.
Abaddon,
apparently
enraptured
by
the
sight
of
the
squid,
seemed
unable
to
pull
his
eyes
away
from
the
glass.
For
a
moment,
the
grown
man
reminded
Trish
of
a
little
boy
at
a
pet-store
window,
wishing
he
could
go
in
and
see
a
puppy.
Five
seconds
later,
he
was
still
staring
longingly
through
the
window.
"Okay,
okay,"
Trish
finally
said,
laughing
as
she
inserted
her
key
card
and
typed
her
PIN
number.
"Come
on.
I'll
show
you
the
squid."
As
Mal'akh
stepped
into
the
dimly
lit
world
of
Pod
3,
he
scanned
the
walls
for
security
cameras.
Katherine's
pudgy
little
assistant
began
rattling
on
about
the
specimens
in
this
room.
Mal'akh
tuned
her
out.
He
had
no
interest
whatsoever
in
giant
squids.
His
only
interest
was
in
using
this
dark,
private
space
to
solve
an
unexpected
problem.
The
wooden
stairs
descending
to
the
Capitol's
subbasement
were
as
steep
and
shallow
as
any
stairs
Langdon
had
ever
traversed.
His
breathing
was
faster
now,
and
his
lungs
felt
tight.
The
air
down
here
was
cold
and
damp,
and
Langdon
couldn't
help
but
flash
on
a
similar
set
of
stairs
he
had
taken
a
few
years
back
into
the
Vatican's
Necropolis.
The
City
of
the
Dead.
Ahead
of
him,
Anderson
led
the
way
with
his
flashlight.
Behind
Langdon,
Sato
followed
closely,
her
tiny
hands
occasionally
pressing
into
Langdon'
s
back.
I'm
going
as
fast
as
I
can.
Langdon
inhaled
deeply,
trying
to
ignore
the
cramped
walls
on
either
side
of
him.
There
was
barely
room
for
his
shoulders
on
this
staircase,
and
his
daybag
now
scraped
down
the
sidewall.
"Maybe
you
should
leave
your
bag
above,"
Sato
offered
behind
him.
"I'm
fine,"
Langdon
replied,
having
no
intention
of
letting
it
out
of
his
sight.
He
pictured
Peter's
little
package
and
could
not
begin
to
imagine
how
it
might
relate
to
anything
in
the
subbasement
of
the
U.S.
Capitol.
"Just
a
few
more
steps,"
Anderson
said.
"Almost
there."
The
group
had
descended
into
darkness,
moving
beyond
the
reach
of
the
staircase's
lone
lightbulb.
When
Langdon
stepped
off
the
final
wooden
tread,
he
could
feel
that
the
floor
beneath
his
feet
was
dirt.
Journey
to
the
center
of
the
Earth.
Sato
stepped
down
behind
him.
Anderson
now
raised
his
beam,
examining
their
surroundings.
The
subbasement
was
less
of
a
basement
than
it
was
an
ultranarrow
corridor
that
ran
perpendicular
to
the
stairs.
Anderson
shone
his
light
left
and
then
right,
and
Langdon
could
see
the
passage
was
only
about
fifty
feet
long
and
lined
on
both
sides
with
small
wooden
doors.
The
doors
abutted
one
another
so
closely
that
the
rooms
behind
them
could
not
have
been
more
than
ten
feet
wide.
ACME
Storage
meets
the
Catacombs
ofDomatilla,
Langdon
thought
as
Anderson
consulted
the
blueprint.
The
tiny
section
depicting
the
subbasement
was
marked
with
an
X
to
show
the
location
of
SBB13.
Langdon
couldn't
help
but
notice
that
the
layout
was
identical
to
a
fourteen-tomb
mausoleum
seven
vaults
facing
seven
vaults
with
one
removed
to
accommodate
the
stairs
they
had
just
descended.
Thirteen
in
all.
He
suspected
America's
"thirteen"
conspiracy
theorists
would
have
a
field
day
if
they
knew
there
were
exactly
thirteen
storage
rooms
buried
beneath
the
U.S.
Capitol.
Some
found
it
suspicious
that
the
Great
Seal
of
the
United
States
had
thirteen
stars,
thirteen
arrows,
thirteen
pyramid
steps,
thirteen
shield
stripes,
thirteen
olive
leaves,
thirteen
olives,
thirteen
letters
in
annuit
coeptis,
thirteen
letters
in
e
pluribus
unum,
and
on
and
on.
"It
does
look
abandoned,"
Anderson
said,
shining
the
beam
into
the
chamber
directly
in
front
of
them.
The
heavy
wooden
door
was
wide
open.
The
shaft
of
light
illuminated
a
narrow
stone
chamber
about
ten
feet
wide
by
some
thirty
feet
deep
like
a
dead-end
hallway
to
nowhere.
The
chamber
contained
nothing
more
than
a
couple
of
old
collapsed
wooden
boxes
and
some
crumpled
packing
paper.
Anderson
shone
his
light
on
a
copper
plate
mounted
on
the
door.
The
plate
was
covered
with
verdigris,
but
the
old
marking
was
legible:
SBB
IV
"SBB
Four,"
Anderson
said.
"Which
one
is
SBB
Thirteen?"
Sato
asked,
faint
wisps
of
steam
curling
out
of
her
mouth
in
the
cold
subterranean
air.
Anderson
turned
the
beam
toward
the
south
end
of
the
corridor.
"Down
there."
Langdon
peered
down
the
narrow
passage
and
shivered,
feeling
a
light
sweat
despite
the
cold.
As
they
moved
through
the
phalanx
of
doorways,
all
of
the
rooms
looked
the
same,
doors
ajar,
apparently
abandoned
long
ago.
When
they
reached
the
end
of
the
line,
Anderson
turned
to
his
right,
raising
the
beam
to
peer
into
room
SBB
13.
The
flashlight
beam,
however,
was
impeded
by
a
heavy
wooden
door.
Unlike
the
others,
the
door
to
SBB
13
was
closed.
This
final
door
looked
exactly
like
the
others
heavy
hinges,
iron
handle,
and
a
copper
number
plate
encrusted
with
green.
The
seven
characters
on
the
number
plate
were
the
same
characters
on
Peter's
palm
upstairs.
SBB
XIII
Please
tell
me
the
door
is
locked,
Langdon
thought.
Sato
spoke
without
hesitation.
"Try
the
door."
The
police
chief
looked
uneasy,
but
he
reached
out,
grasped
the
heavy
iron
handle,
and
pushed
down
on
it.
The
handle
didn't
budge.
He
shone
the
light
now,
illuminating
a
heavy,
old-fashioned
lock
plate
and
keyhole.
"Try
the
master
key,"
Sato
said.
Anderson
produced
the
main
key
from
the
entry
door
upstairs,
but
it
was
not
even
close
to
fitting.
"Am
I
mistaken,"
Sato
said,
her
tone
sarcastic,
"or
shouldn't
Security
have
access
to
every
corner
of
a
building
in
case
of
emergency?"
Anderson
exhaled
and
looked
back
at
Sato.
"Ma'am,
my
men
are
checking
for
a
secondary
key,
but
"Shoot
the
lock,"
she
said,
nodding
toward
the
key
plate
beneath
the
lever.
Langdon'
s
pulse
leaped.
Anderson
cleared
his
throat,
sounding
uneasy.
"Ma'am,
I'm
waiting
for
news
on
a
secondary
key.
I
am
not
sure
I'm
comfortable
blasting
our
way
into
"Perhaps
you'd
be
more
comfortable
in
prison
for
obstructing
a
CIA
investigation?"
Anderson
looked
incredulous.
After
a
long
beat,
he
reluctantly
handed
the
light
to
Sato
and
unsnapped
his
holster.
"Wait!"
Langdon
said,
no
longer
able
to
stand
idly
by.
"Think
about
it.
Peter
gave
up
his
right
hand
rather
than
reveal
whatever
might
be
behind
this
door.
Are
you
sure
we
want
to
do
this?
Unlocking
this
door
is
essentially
complying
with
the
demands
of
a
terrorist."
"Do
you
want
to
get
Peter
Solomon
back?"
Sato
asked.
"Of
course,
but"
"Then
I
suggest
you
do
exactly
what
his
captor
is
requesting."
"Unlock
an
ancient
portal?
You
think
this
is
the
portal?"
Sato
shone
the
light
in
Langdon'
s
face.
"Professor,
I
have
no
idea
what
the
hell
this
is.
Whether
it's
a
storage
unit
or
the
secret
entrance
to
an
ancient
pyramid,
I
intend
to
open
it.
Do
I
make
myself
clear?"
Langdon
squinted
into
the
light
and
finally
nodded.
Sato
lowered
the
beam
and
redirected
it
at
the
door'
s
antique
key
plate.
"Chief?
Go
ahead."
Still
looking
averse
to
the
plan,
Anderson
extracted
his
sidearm
very,
very
slowly,
gazing
down
at
it
with
uncertainty.
"Oh,
for
God's
sake!"
Sato's
tiny
hands
shot
out,
and
she
grabbed
the
weapon
from
him.
She
stuffed
the
flashlight
into
his
now
empty
palm.
"Shine
the
damned
light."
She
handled
the
gun
with
the
confidence
of
someone
who
had
trained
with
weapons,
wasting
no
time
turning
off
the
pistol's
safety,
cocking
the
weapon,
and
aiming
at
the
lock.
"Wait!"
Langdon
yelled,
but
he
was
too
late.
The
gun
roared
three
times.
Langdon'
s
eardrums
felt
like
they
had
exploded.
Is
she
insane?!
The
gunshots
in
the
tiny
space
had
been
deafening.
Anderson
also
looked
shaken,
his
hand
wavering
a
bit
as
he
shone
the
flashlight
on
the
bullet-riddled
door.
The
lock
mechanism
was
now
in
tatters,
the
wood
surrounding
it
entirely
pulverized.
The
lock
had
released,
the
door
now
having
fallen
ajar.
Sato
extended
the
pistol
and
pressed
the
tip
of
the
barrel
against
the
door,
giving
it
a
push.
The
door
swung
fully
into
the
blackness
beyond.
Langdon
peered
in
but
could
see
nothing
in
the
darkness.
What
in
the
world
is
that
smell?
An
unusual,
fetid
odor
wafted
out
of
the
darkness.
Anderson
stepped
into
the
doorway
and
shone
the
light
on
the
floor,
tracing
carefully
down
the
length
of
the
barren
dirt
floor.
This
room
was
like
the
others
a
long,
narrow
space.
The
sidewalls
were
rugged
stone,
giving
the
room
the
feel
of
an
ancient
prison
cell.
But
that
smell
"There's
nothing
here,"
Anderson
said,
moving
the
beam
farther
down
the
chamber
floor.
Finally,
as
the
beam
reached
the
end
of
the
floor,
he
raised
it
up
to
illuminate
the
chamber's
farthest
wall.
"My
God
!"
Anderson
shouted.
Everyone
saw
it
and
jumped
back.
Langdon
stared
in
disbelief
at
the
deepest
recess
of
the
chamber.
To
his
horror,
something
was
staring
back.
"What
in
God's
name
?"
At
the
threshold
of
SBB13,
Anderson
fumbled
with
his
light
and
retreated
a
step.
Langdon
also
recoiled,
as
did
Sato,
who
looked
startled
for
the
first
time
all
night.
Sato
aimed
the
gun
at
the
back
wall
and
motioned
for
Anderson
to
shine
the
light
again.
Anderson
raised
the
light.
The
beam
was
dim
by
the
time
it
reached
the
far
wall,
but
the
light
was
enough
to
illuminate
the
shape
of
a
pallid
and
ghostly
face,
staring
back
at
them
through
lifeless
sockets.
A
human
skull.
The
skull
sat
atop
a
rickety
wooden
desk
positioned
against
the
rear
wall
of
the
chamber.
Two
human
leg
bones
sat
beside
the
skull,
along
with
a
collection
of
other
items
that
were
meticulously
arranged
on
the
desk
in
shrinelike
fashion
an
antique
hourglass,
a
crystal
flask,
a
candle,
two
saucers
of
pale
powder,
and
a
sheet
of
paper.
Propped
against
the
wall
beside
the
desk
stood
the
fearsome
shape
of
a
long
scythe,
its
curved
blade
as
familiar
as
that
of
the
grim
reaper.
Sato
stepped
into
the
room.
"Well,
now
it
appears
Peter
Solomon
keeps
more
secrets
than
I
imagined."
Anderson
nodded,
inching
after
her.
"Talk
about
skeletons
in
your
closet."
He
raised
the
light
and
surveyed
the
rest
of
the
empty
chamber.
"And
that
smellT
he
added,
crinkling
his
nose.
"What
is
it?"
"Sulfur,"
Langdon
replied
evenly
behind
them.
"There
should
be
two
saucers
on
the
desk.
The
saucer
on
the
right
will
contain
salt.
And
the
other
sulfur."
Sato
wheeled
in
disbelief.
"How
the
hell
would
you
know
thatV"
"Because,
ma'am,
there
are
rooms
exactly
like
this
all
over
the
world."
One
story
above
the
subbasement,
Capitol
security
guard
Nunez
escorted
the
Architect
of
the
Capitol,
Warren
Bellamy,
down
the
long
hallway
that
ran
the
length
of
the
eastern
basement.
Nunez
could
have
sworn
that
he
had
just
heard
three
gunshots
down
here,
muffled
and
underground.
There
's
no
way.
"Subbasement
door
is
open,"
Bellamy
said,
squinting
down
the
hallway
at
a
door
that
stood
ajar
in
the
distance.
Strange
evening
indeed,
Nunez
thought.
Nobody
goes
down
there.
"I'll
be
glad
to
find
out
what's
going
on,"
he
said,
reaching
for
his
radio.
"Go
back
to
your
duties,"
Bellamy
said.
"I'm
fine
from
here."
Nunez
shifted
uneasily.
"You
sure?"
Warren
Bellamy
stopped,
placing
a
firm
hand
on
Nunez's
shoulder.
"Son,
I've
worked
here
for
twenty-five
years.
I
think
I
can
find
my
way."
Mal'akh
had
seen
some
eerie
spaces
in
his
life,
but
few
rivaled
the
unearthly
world
of
Pod
3.
Wet
Pod.
The
massive
room
looked
as
if
a
mad
scientist
had
taken
over
a
Walmart
and
packed
every
aisle
and
shelf
with
specimen
jars
of
all
shapes
and
sizes.
Lit
like
a
photographic
darkroom,
the
space
was
bathed
in
a
reddish
haze
of
"safelight"
that
emanated
from
beneath
the
shelves,
filtering
upward
and
illuminating
the
ethanol-
filled
containers.
The
clinical
smell
of
preservative
chemicals
was
nauseating.
"This
pod
houses
over
twenty
thousand
species,"
the
chubby
girl
was
saying.
"Fish,
rodents,
mammals,
reptiles."
"All
dead,
I
hope?"
Mal'akh
asked,
making
a
show
of
sounding
nervous.
The
girl
laughed.
"Yes,
yes.
All
very
much
dead.
I'll
admit,
I
didn't
dare
come
in
for
at
least
six
months
after
I
started
work."
Mal'akh
could
understand
why.
Everywhere
he
looked
there
were
specimen
jars
of
dead
life-forms
salamanders,
jellyfish,
rats,
bugs,
birds,
and
other
things
he
could
not
begin
to
identify.
As
if
this
collection
were
not
unsettling
enough
on
its
own,
the
hazy
red
safelights
that
protected
these
photosensitive
specimens
from
long-term
light
exposure
gave
the
visitor
the
feeling
he
was
standing
inside
a
giant
aquarium,
where
lifeless
creatures
were
somehow
congregating
to
watch
from
the
shadows.
"That's
a
coelacanth,"
the
girl
said,
pointing
to
a
big
Plexiglas
container
that
held
the
ugliest
fish
Mal'akh
had
ever
seen.
"They
were
thought
to
be
extinct
with
the
dinosaurs,
but
this
was
caught
off
Africa
a
few
years
back
and
donated
to
the
Smithsonian."
Lucky
you,
Mal'akh
thought,
barely
listening.
He
was
busy
scanning
the
walls
for
security
cameras.
He
saw
only
one
trained
on
the
entry
door
not
surprising,
considering
that
entrance
was
probably
the
only
way
in.
"And
here
is
what
you
wanted
to
see"
she
said,
leading
him
to
the
giant
tank
he
had
seen
from
the
window.
"Our
longest
specimen."
She
swept
her
arm
out
over
the
vile
creature
like
a
game-show
host
displaying
a
new
car.
"Architeuthis."
The
squid
tank
looked
like
a
series
of
glass
phone
booths
had
been
laid
on
their
sides
and
fused
end
to
end.
Within
the
long,
clear
Plexiglas
coffin
hovered
a
sickeningly
pale
and
amorphous
shape.
Mal'akh
gazed
down
at
the
bulbous,
saclike
head
and
its
basketball-
size
eyes.
"Almost
makes
your
coelacanth
look
handsome,"
he
said.
"Wait
till
you
see
her
lit."
Trish
flipped
back
the
long
lid
of
the
tank.
Ethanol
fumes
wafted
out
as
she
reached
down
into
the
tank
and
flipped
a
switch
just
above
the
liquid
line.
A
string
of
fluorescent
lights
flickered
to
life
along
the
entire
base
of
the
tank.
Architeuthis
was
now
shining
in
all
her
glory
a
colossal
head
attached
to
a
slithery
mass
of
decaying
tentacles
and
razor-
sharp
suckers.
She
began
talking
about
how
Architeuthis
could
beat
a
sperm
whale
in
a
fight.
Mal'akh
heard
only
empty
prattling.
The
time
had
come.
Trish
Dunne
always
felt
a
bit
uneasy
in
Pod
3,
but
the
chill
that
had
just
run
through
her
felt
different.
Visceral.
Primal.
She
tried
to
ignore
it,
but
it
grew
quickly
now,
clawing
deeply
at
her.
Although
Trish
could
not
seem
to
place
the
source
of
her
anxiety,
her
gut
was
clearly
telling
her
it
was
time
to
leave.
"Anyhow,
that's
the
squid,"
she
said,
reaching
into
the
tank
and
turning
off
the
display
light.
"We
should
probably
get
back
to
Katherine's
A
broad
palm
clamped
hard
over
her
mouth,
yanking
her
head
back.
Instantly,
a
powerful
arm
was
wrapped
around
her
torso,
pinning
her
against
a
rock-hard
chest.
For
a
split
second,
Trish
went
numb
with
shock.
Then
came
the
terror.
The
man
groped
across
her
chest,
grabbing
her
key
card
and
yanking
down
hard.
The
cord
burned
the
back
of
her
neck
before
snapping.
The
key
card
fell
on
the
floor
at
their
feet.
She
fought,
trying
to
twist
away,
but
she
was
no
match
for
the
man's
size
and
strength.
She
tried
to
scream,
but
his
hand
remained
tightly
across
her
mouth.
He
leaned
down
and
placed
his
mouth
next
to
her
ear,
whispering,
"When
I
take
my
hand
off
your
mouth,
you
will
not
scream,
is
that
clear?"
She
nodded
vigorously,
her
lungs
burning
for
air.
/
can
't
breathe!
The
man
removed
his
hand
from
her
mouth,
and
Trish
gasped,
inhaling
deeply.
"Let
me
go!"
she
demanded,
breathless.
"What
the
hell
are
you
doing?"
"Tell
me
your
PIN
number,"
the
man
said.
Trish
felt
totally
at
a
loss.
Katherine!
Help!
Who
is
this
man?!
"Security
can
see
you!"
she
said,
knowing
full
well
they
were
out
of
range
of
the
cameras.
And
nobody
is
watching
anyway.
"Your
PIN
number,"
the
man
repeated.
"The
one
that
matches
your
key
card."
An
icy
fear
churned
in
her
gut,
and
Trish
spun
violently,
wriggling
an
arm
free
and
twisting
around,
clawing
at
the
man's
eyes.
Her
fingers
hit
flesh
and
raked
down
one
cheek.
Four
dark
gashes
opened
on
his
flesh
where
she
scratched
him.
Then
she
realized
the
dark
stripes
on
his
flesh
were
not
blood.
The
man
was
wearing
makeup,
which
she
had
just
scratched
off,
revealing
dark
tattoos
hidden
underneath.
Who
is
this
monster?!
With
seemingly
superhuman
strength,
the
man
spun
her
around
and
hoisted
her
up,
pushing
her
out
over
the
open
squid
tank,
her
face
now
over
the
ethanol.
The
fumes
burned
her
nostrils.
"What
is
your
PIN
number?"
he
repeated.
Her
eyes
burned,
and
she
could
see
the
pale
flesh
of
the
squid
submerged
beneath
her
face.
"Tell
me,"
he
said,
pushing
her
face
closer
to
the
surface.
"What
is
it?"
Her
throat
was
burning
now.
"Zero-eight-zero-four!"
she
blurted,
barely
able
to
breathe.
"Let
me
go!
Zero-
eight-
zero-four
!
"If
you're
lying,"
he
said,
pushing
down
farther,
her
hair
in
the
ethanol
now.
"I'm
not
lying!"
she
said,
coughing.
"August
4!
It's
my
birthday!"
"Thank
you,
Trish."
His
powerful
hands
clasped
her
head
tighter,
and
a
crushing
force
rammed
her
downward,
plunging
her
face
into
the
tank.
Searing
pain
burned
her
eyes.
The
man
pressed
down
harder,
driving
her
whole
head
under
the
ethanol.
Trish
felt
her
face
pressing
into
the
fleshy
head
of
the
squid.
Summoning
all
of
her
strength,
she
bucked
violently,
arching
backward,
trying
to
pull
her
head
out
of
the
tank.
But
the
powerful
hands
did
not
budge.
/
have
to
breathe!
She
remained
submerged,
straining
not
to
open
her
eyes
or
mouth.
Her
lungs
burned
as
she
fought
the
powerful
urge
to
breathe
in.
No!
Don't!
But
Trish'
s
inhalation
reflex
finally
took
over.
Her
mouth
flew
open,
and
her
lungs
expanded
violently,
attempting
to
suck
in
the
oxygen
that
her
body
craved.
In
a
searing
rush,
a
wave
of
ethanol
poured
into
her
mouth.
As
the
chemicals
gushed
down
her
throat
into
her
lungs,
Trish
felt
a
pain
like
nothing
she
had
ever
imagined
possible.
Mercifully,
it
lasted
only
a
few
seconds
before
her
world
went
black.
Mal'akh
stood
beside
the
tank,
catching
his
breath
and
surveying
the
damage.
The
lifeless
woman
lay
slumped
over
the
rim
of
the
tank,
her
face
still
submerged
in
ethanol.
Seeing
her
there,
Mal'akh
flashed
on
the
only
other
woman
he
had
ever
killed.
Isabel
Solomon.
Long
ago.
Another
life.
Mal'akh
gazed
down
now
at
the
woman's
flaccid
corpse.
He
grabbed
her
ample
hips
and
lifted
with
his
legs,
hoisting
her
up,
pushing
forward,
until
she
began
to
slide
over
the
rim
of
the
squid
tank.
Trish
Dunne
slithered
headfirst
down
into
the
ethanol.
The
rest
of
her
body
followed,
sloshing
down.
Gradually,
the
ripples
subsided,
leaving
the
woman
hovering
limp
over
the
huge
sea
creature.
As
her
clothing
got
heavier,
she
began
to
sink,
slipping
into
the
darkness.
Bit
by
bit,
Trish
Dunne's
body
settled
on
top
of
the
great
beast.
Mal'akh
wiped
his
hands
and
replaced
the
Plexiglas
lid,
sealing
the
tank.
Wet
Pod
has
a
new
specimen.
He
retrieved
Trish'
s
key
card
from
the
floor
and
slipped
it
in
his
pocket:
0804.
When
Mal'akh
had
first
seen
Trish
in
the
lobby,
he'd
seen
a
liability.
Then
he'd
realized
her
key
card
and
password
were
his
insurance.
If
Katherine's
data-storage
room
was
as
secure
as
Peter
had
implied,
then
Mal'akh
was
anticipating
some
challenges
persuading
Katherine
to
unlock
it
for
him.
/
now
have
my
own
set
of
keys.
He
was
pleased
to
know
he
would
no
longer
have
to
waste
time
bending
Katherine
to
his
will.
As
Mal'akh
stood
up
straight,
he
saw
his
own
reflection
in
the
window
and
could
tell
his
makeup
was
badly
mangled.
It
didn't
matter
anymore.
By
the
time
Katherine
put
it
all
together,
it
would
be
too
late.
"This
room
is
Masonic?"
Sato
demanded,
turning
from
the
skull
and
staring
at
Langdon
in
the
darkness.
Langdon
nodded
calmly.
"It's
called
a
Chamber
of
Reflection.
These
rooms
are
designed
as
cold,
austere
places
in
which
a
Mason
can
reflect
on
his
own
mortality.
By
meditating
on
the
inevitability
of
death,
a
Mason
gains
a
valuable
perspective
on
the
fleeting
nature
of
life."
Sato
looked
around
the
eerie
space,
apparently
not
convinced.
"This
is
some
kind
of
meditation
room?"
"Essentially,
yes.
These
chambers
always
incorporate
the
same
symbols
skull
and
crossed
bones,
scythe,
hourglass,
sulfur,
salt,
blank
paper,
a
candle,
et
cetera.
The
symbols
of
death
inspire
Masons
to
ponder
how
better
to
lead
their
lives
while
on
this
earth."
"It
looks
like
a
death
shrine,"
Anderson
said.
That's
kind
of
the
point.
"Most
of
my
symbology
students
have
the
same
reaction
at
first."
Langdon
often
assigned
them
Symbols
of
Freemasonry
by
Beresniak,
which
contained
beautiful
photos
of
Chambers
of
Reflection.
"And
your
students,"
Sato
demanded,
"don't
find
it
unnerving
that
Masons
meditate
with
skulls
and
scythes?"
"No
more
unnerving
than
Christians
praying
at
the
feet
of
a
man
nailed
to
a
cross,
or
Hindus
chanting
in
front
of
a
four-armed
elephant
named
Ganesh.
Misunderstanding
a
culture's
symbols
is
a
common
root
of
prejudice."
Sato
turned
away,
apparently
in
no
mood
for
a
lecture.
She
moved
toward
the
table
of
artifacts.
Anderson
tried
to
light
her
way
with
the
flashlight,
but
the
beam
was
beginning
to
dim.
He
tapped
the
heel
of
the
light
and
coaxed
it
to
burn
a
little
brighter.
As
the
threesome
moved
deeper
into
the
narrow
space,
the
pungent
tang
of
sulfur
filled
Langdon's
nostrils.
The
subbasement
was
damp,
and
the
humidity
in
the
air
was
activating
the
sulfur
in
the
bowl.
Sato
arrived
at
the
table
and
stared
down
at
the
skull
and
accompanying
objects.
Anderson
joined
her,
doing
his
best
to
light
the
desk
with
the
weakening
beam
of
his
flashlight.
Sato
examined
everything
on
the
table
and
then
placed
her
hands
on
her
hips,
sighing.
"What
is
all
this
junk?"
The
artifacts
in
this
room,
Langdon
knew,
were
carefully
selected
and
arranged.
"Symbols
of
transformation,"
he
told
her,
feeling
confined
as
he
inched
forward
and
joined
them
at
the
table.
"The
skull,
or
caput
mortuum,
represents
man's
final
transformation
through
decay;
it's
a
reminder
that
we
all
shed
our
mortal
flesh
one
day.
The
sulfur
and
salt
are
alchemical
catalysts
that
facilitate
transformation.
The
hourglass
represents
the
transformational
power
of
time."
He
motioned
to
the
unlit
candle.
"And
this
candle
represents
the
formative
primordial
fire
and
the
awakening
of
man
from
his
ignorant
slumber
transformation
through
illumination."
"And
thatV
Sato
asked,
pointing
into
the
corner.
Anderson
swung
his
dimming
flashlight
beam
to
the
giant
scythe
that
leaned
against
the
back
wall.
"Not
a
death
symbol,
as
most
assume,"
Langdon
said.
"The
scythe
is
actually
a
symbol
of
the
transformative
nourishment
of
nature
the
reaping
of
nature's
gifts."
Sato
and
Anderson
fell
silent,
apparently
trying
to
process
their
bizarre
surroundings.
Langdon
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
get
out
of
the
place.
"I
realize
this
room
may
seem
unusual,"
he
told
them,
"but
there's
nothing
to
see
here;
it's
really
quite
normal.
A
lot
of
Masonic
lodges
have
chambers
exactly
like
this
one."
"But
this
is
not
a
Masonic
lodge
["Anderson
declared.
"It's
the
U.S.
Capitol,
and
I'd
like
to
know
what
the
hell
this
room
is
doing
in
my
building."
"Sometimes
Masons
set
aside
rooms
like
this
in
their
offices
or
private
homes
as
meditation
spaces.
It
is
not
uncommon."
Langdon
knew
a
heart
surgeon
in
Boston
who
had
converted
a
closet
in
his
office
into
a
Masonic
Chamber
of
Reflection
so
he
could
ponder
mortality
before
going
into
surgery.
Sato
looked
troubled.
"You're
saying
Peter
Solomon
comes
down
here
to
reflect
on
death?"
"I
really
don't
know,"
Langdon
said
sincerely.
"Maybe
he
created
it
as
a
sanctuary
for
his
Masonic
brothers
who
work
in
the
building,
giving
them
a
spiritual
sanctuary
away
from
the
chaos
of
the
material
world
a
place
for
a
powerful
lawmaker
to
reflect
before
making
decisions
that
affect
his
fellow
man."
"Lovely
sentiment,"
Sato
said,
her
tone
sarcastic,
"but
I
have
a
feeling
Americans
might
have
a
problem
with
their
leaders
praying
in
closets
with
scythes
and
skulls."
Well,
they
shouldn
't,
Langdon
thought,
imagining
how
different
a
world
it
might
be
if
more
leaders
took
time
to
ponder
the
finality
of
death
before
racing
off
to
war.
Sato
pursed
her
lips
and
carefully
surveyed
all
four
corners
of
the
candle
lit
chamber.
"There
must
be
something
in
here
besides
human
bones
and
bowls
of
chemicals,
Professor.
Someone
transported
you
all
the
way
from
your
home
in
Cambridge
to
be
in
this
precise
room."
Langdon
clutched
his
daybag
to
his
side,
still
unable
to
imagine
how
the
package
he
carried
might
relate
to
this
chamber.
"Ma'am,
I'm
sorry,
but
I
don't
see
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
here."
Langdon
hoped
that
now
at
last
they
could
get
to
the
business
of
trying
to
find
Peter.
Anderson's
light
flickered
again,
and
Sato
spun
on
him,
her
temper
starting
to
show.
"For
Christ's
sake,
is
it
too
much
to
ask?"
She
plunged
her
hand
into
her
pocket
and
yanked
out
a
cigarette
lighter.
Striking
her
thumb
on
the
flint,
she
held
out
the
flame
and
lit
the
desk's
lone
candle.
The
wick
sputtered
and
then
caught,
spreading
a
ghostly
luminescence
throughout
the
constricted
space.
Long
shadows
raked
the
stone
walls.
As
the
flame
grew
brighter,
an
unexpected
sight
materialized
before
them.
"Look!"
Anderson
said,
pointing.
In
the
candlelight,
they
could
now
see
a
faded
patch
of
graffiti
seven
capital
letters
scrawled
across
the
rear
wall.
VITRIOL
"An
odd
choice
of
word,"
Sato
said
as
the
candlelight
cast
a
frightening
skull-shaped
silhouette
across
the
letters.
"Actually,
it's
an
acronym,"
Langdon
said.
"It's
written
on
the
rear
wall
of
most
chambers
like
this
as
a
shorthand
for
the
Masonic
meditative
mantra:
Visita
interiora
terrae,
rectificando
invenies
occultum
lapidem."
Sato
eyed
him,
looking
almost
impressed.
"Meaning?"
"Visit
the
interior
of
the
earth,
and
by
rectifying,
you
will
find
the
hidden
stone."
Sato's
gaze
sharpened.
"Does
the
hidden
stone
have
any
connection
to
a
hidden
pyramid?"
Langdon
shrugged,
not
wanting
to
encourage
the
comparison.
"Those
who
enjoy
fantasizing
about
hidden
pyramids
in
Washington
would
tell
you
that
occultum
lapidem
refers
to
the
stone
pyramid,
yes.
Others
will
tell
you
it's
a
reference
to
the
Philosopher's
Stone
a
substance
alchemists
believed
could
bring
them
everlasting
life
or
turn
lead
into
gold.
Others
claim
it's
a
reference
to
the
Holy
of
Holies,
a
hidden
stone
chamber
at
the
core
of
the
Great
Temple.
Some
say
it's
a
Christian
reference
to
the
hidden
teachings
of
Saint
Peter
the
Rock.
Every
esoteric
tradition
interprets
'the
stone'
in
its
own
way,
but
invariably
the
occultum
lapidem
is
a
source
of
power
and
enlightenment."
Anderson
cleared
his
throat.
"Is
it
possible
Solomon
lied
to
this
guy?
Maybe
he
told
him
there
was
something
down
here
and
there
really
isn't."
Langdon
was
having
similar
thoughts.
Without
warning,
the
candle
flame
flickered,
as
if
caught
by
a
draft.
It
dimmed
for
a
moment
and
then
recovered,
burning
brightly
again.
"That's
odd,"
Anderson
said.
"I
hope
no
one
closed
the
door
upstairs."
He
strode
out
of
the
chamber
into
the
darkness
of
the
hallway.
"Hello?"
Langdon
barely
noticed
him
leave.
His
gaze
had
been
drawn
suddenly
to
the
rear
wall.
What
just
happened?
"Did
you
see
that?"
Sato
asked,
also
staring
with
alarm
at
the
wall.
Langdon
nodded,
his
pulse
quickening.
What
did
I
just
see?
A
moment
earlier,
the
rear
wall
seemed
to
have
shimmered,
as
if
a
ripple
of
energy
had
passed
through
it.
Anderson
now
strode
back
into
the
room.
"No
one's
out
there."
As
he
entered,
the
wall
shimmered
again.
"Holy
shit!"
he
exclaimed,
jumping
back.
All
three
stood
mute
for
a
long
moment,
staring
in
unison
at
the
back
wall.
Langdon
felt
another
chill
run
through
him
as
he
realized
what
they
were
seeing.
He
reached
out
tentatively,
until
his
fingertips
touched
the
rear
surface
of
the
chamber.
"It's
not
a
wall,"
he
said.
Anderson
and
Sato
stepped
closer,
peering
intently.
"It's
a
canvas,"
Langdon
said.
"But
it
billowed,"
Sato
said
quickly.
Yes,
in
a
very
strange
way.
Langdon
examined
the
surface
more
closely.
The
sheen
on
the
canvas
had
refracted
the
candlelight
in
a
startling
manner
because
the
canvas
had
just
billowed
away
from
the
room
fluttering
backward
through
the
plane
of
the
rear
wall.
Langdon
extended
his
outstretched
fingers
very
gently,
pressing
the
canvas
backward.
Startled,
he
yanked
his
hand
back.
There
's
an
opening!
"Pull
it
aside,"
Sato
ordered.
Langdon'
s
heart
pounded
wildly
now.
He
reached
up
and
clutched
the
edge
of
the
canvas
banner,
slowly
pulling
the
fabric
to
one
side.
He
stared
in
disbelief
at
what
lay
hidden
behind
it.
My
God.
Sato
and
Anderson
stood
in
stunned
silence
as
they
looked
through
the
opening
in
the
rear
wall.
Finally,
Sato
spoke.
"It
appears
we've
just
found
our
pyramid."
Robert
Langdon
stared
at
the
opening
in
the
rear
wall
of
the
chamber.
Hidden
behind
the
canvas
banner,
a
perfectly
square
hole
had
been
hollowed
out
of
the
wall.
The
opening,
about
three
feet
across,
appeared
to
have
been
created
by
removing
a
series
of
bricks.
For
a
moment,
in
the
darkness,
Langdon
thought
the
hole
was
a
window
to
a
room
beyond.
Now
he
saw
it
was
not.
The
opening
extended
only
a
few
feet
into
the
wall
before
terminating.
Like
a
rough-hewn
cubbyhole,
the
recessed
niche
reminded
Langdon
of
a
museum
alcove
designed
to
hold
a
statuette.
Fittingly,
this
niche
displayed
one
small
object.
About
nine
inches
tall,
it
was
a
piece
of
carved,
solid
granite.
The
surface
was
elegant
and
smooth
with
four
polished
sides
that
shone
in
the
candlelight.
Langdon
could
not
fathom
what
it
was
doing
here.
A
stone
pyramid?
"From
your
look
of
surprise,"
Sato
said,
sounding
self-satisfied,
"I
take
it
this
object
is
not
typical
within
a
Chamber
of
Reflection?"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"Then
perhaps
you
would
like
to
reassess
your
previous
claims
regarding
the
legend
of
a
Masonic
Pyramid
hidden
in
Washington?"
Her
tone
now
was
almost
smug.
"Director,"
Langdon
replied
instantly,
"this
little
pyramid
is
not
the
Masonic
Pyramid."
"So
it
is
merely
coincidence
that
we
found
a
pyramid
hidden
at
the
heart
of
the
U.S.
Capitol
in
a
secret
chamber
belonging
to
a
Masonic
leader?"
Langdon
rubbed
his
eyes
and
tried
to
think
clearly.
"Ma'am,
this
pyramid
doesn't
resemble
the
myth
in
any
way.
The
Masonic
Pyramid
is
described
as
enormous,
with
a
tip
forged
of
solid
gold."
Moreover,
Langdon
knew,
this
little
pyramid
with
its
flat
top
was
not
even
a
true
pyramid.
Without
its
tip,
this
was
another
symbol
entirely.
Known
as
an
Unfinished
Pyramid,
it
was
a
symbolic
reminder
that
man's
ascent
to
his
full
human
potential
was
always
a
work
in
progress.
Though
few
realized
it,
this
symbol
was
the
most
widely
published
symbol
on
earth.
Over
twenty
billion
in
print.
Adorning
every
one-dollar
bill
in
circulation,
the
Unfinished
Pyramid
waited
patiently
for
its
shining
capstone,
which
hovered
above
it
as
a
reminder
of
America's
yet-unfulfilled
destiny
and
the
work
yet
to
be
done,
both
as
a
country
and
as
individuals.
"Lift
it
down,"
Sato
said
to
Anderson,
motioning
to
the
pyramid.
"I
want
a
closer
look."
She
began
making
room
on
the
desk
by
shoving
the
skull
and
crossed
bones
to
one
side
with
no
reverence
whatsoever.
Langdon
was
starting
to
feel
like
they
were
common
grave
robbers,
desecrating
a
personal
shrine.
Anderson
maneuvered
past
Langdon,
reached
into
the
niche,
and
clamped
his
large
palms
on
either
side
of
the
pyramid.
Then,
barely
able
to
lift
at
this
awkward
angle,
he
slid
the
pyramid
toward
him
and
lowered
it
with
a
hard
thud
onto
the
wooden
desk.
He
stepped
back
to
give
Sato
room.
The
director
repositioned
the
candle
close
to
the
pyramid
and
studied
its
polished
surface.
Slowly,
she
ran
her
tiny
fingers
over
it,
examining
every
inch
of
the
flat
top,
and
then
the
sides.
She
wrapped
her
hands
around
to
feel
the
back,
then
frowned
in
apparent
disappointment.
"Professor,
earlier
you
said
the
Masonic
Pyramid
was
constructed
to
protect
secret
information."
"That's
the
legend,
yes."
"So,
hypothetically
speaking,
if
Peter's
captor
believed
this
was
the
Masonic
Pyramid,
he
would
believe
it
contained
powerful
information."
Langdon
nodded,
exasperated.
"Yes,
although
even
if
he
found
this
information,
he
probably
would
not
be
able
to
read
it.
According
to
legend,
the
contents
of
the
pyramid
are
encoded,
making
them
indecipherable
.
.
.
except
to
the
most
worthy."
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
Despite
Langdon'
s
growing
impatience,
he
replied
with
an
even
tone.
"Mythological
treasures
are
always
protected
by
tests
of
worthiness.
As
you
may
recall,
in
the
legend
of
the
Sword
in
the
Stone,
the
stone
refuses
to
give
up
the
sword
except
to
Arthur,
who
was
spiritually
prepared
to
wield
the
sword's
awesome
power.
The
Masonic
Pyramid
is
based
on
the
same
idea.
In
this
case,
the
information
is
the
treasure,
and
it
is
said
to
be
written
in
an
encoded
language
a
mystical
tongue
of
lost
words
legible
only
to
the
worthy."
A
faint
smile
crossed
Sato's
lips.
"That
may
explain
why
you
were
summoned
here
tonight."
"I'm
sorry?"
Calmly,
Sato
rotated
the
pyramid
in
place,
turning
it
a
full
180
degrees.
The
pyramid's
fourth
side
now
shone
in
the
candlelight.
Robert
Langdon
stared
at
it
with
surprise.
"It
appears,"
Sato
said,
"that
someone
believes
you're
worthy."
What's
taking
Trish
so
long?
Katherine
Solomon
checked
her
watch
again.
She'd
forgotten
to
warn
Dr.
Abaddon
about
the
bizarre
commute
to
her
lab,
but
she
couldn't
imagine
the
darkness
had
slowed
them
down
this
much.
They
should
have
arrived
by
now.
Katherine
walked
over
to
the
exit
and
heaved
open
the
lead-lined
door,
staring
out
into
the
void.
She
listened
for
a
moment,
but
heard
nothing.
"Trish?"
she
called
out,
her
voice
swallowed
by
the
darkness.
Silence.
Puzzled,
she
closed
the
door,
took
out
her
cell
phone,
and
called
the
lobby.
"This
is
Katherine.
Is
Trish
out
there?"
"No,
ma'am,"
the
lobby
guard
said.
"She
and
your
guest
headed
back
about
ten
minutes
ago."
"Really?
I
don't
think
they're
even
inside
Pod
Five
yet."
"Hold
on.
I'll
check."
Katherine
could
hear
the
guard's
fingers
clicking
on
his
computer
keyboard.
"You're
right.
According
to
Ms.
Dunne's
key-card
logs,
she
has
not
yet
opened
the
Pod
Five
door.
Her
last
access
event
was
about
eight
minutes
ago
at
Pod
Three.
I
guess
she's
giving
your
guest
a
little
tour
on
his
way
in."
Katherine
frowned.
Apparently.
The
news
was
a
bit
odd,
but
at
least
she
knew
Trish
wouldn't
be
long
in
Pod
3.
The
smell
in
there
is
terrible.
"Thanks.
Has
my
brother
arrived
yet?"
"No,
ma'am,
not
yet."
"Thank
you."
As
Katherine
hung
up,
she
felt
an
unexpected
twinge
of
trepidation.
The
uneasy
feeling
made
her
pause,
but
only
for
a
moment.
It
was
the
same
exact
disquiet
she'd
felt
earlier
when
she
stepped
into
Dr.
Abaddon's
house.
Embarrassingly,
her
feminine
intuition
had
failed
her
there.
Badly.
It's
nothing,
Katherine
told
herself.
Robert
Langdon
studied
the
stone
pyramid.
This
isn
't
possible.
"An
ancient
encoded
language,"
Sato
said
without
looking
up.
"Tell
me,
does
this
qualify?"
On
the
newly
exposed
face
of
the
pyramid,
a
series
of
sixteen
characters
was
precisely
engraved
into
the
smooth
stone.
Beside
Langdon,
Anderson's
mouth
now
gaped
open,
mirroring
Langdon'
s
own
shock.
The
security
chief
looked
like
he
had
just
seen
some
kind
of
alien
keypad.
"Professor?"
Sato
said.
"I
assume
you
can
read
this?"
Langdon
turned.
"Why
would
you
assume
that?"
"Because
you
were
brought
here,
Professor.
You
were
chosen.
This
inscription
appears
to
be
a
code
of
some
sort,
and
considering
your
reputation,
it
seems
obvious
to
me
that
you
were
brought
here
to
decipher
it."
Langdon
had
to
admit
that
after
his
experiences
in
Rome
and
Paris,
he'd
received
a
steady
flow
of
requests
asking
for
his
help
deciphering
some
of
history's
great
unsolved
codes
the
Phaistos
Disk,
the
Dorabella
Cipher,
the
mysterious
Voynich
Manuscript.
Sato
ran
her
finger
over
the
inscription.
"Can
you
tell
me
the
meaning
of
these
icons?"
They
're
not
icons,
Langdon
thought.
They
're
symbols.
The
language
was
one
he
had
recognized
immediately
an
encrypted
cipher
language
from
the
seventeenth
century.
Langdon
knew
very
well
how
to
break
it.
"Ma'am,"
he
said,
feeling
hesitant,
"this
pyramid
is
Peter's
private
property."
"Private
or
not,
if
this
code
is
indeed
the
reason
you
were
brought
to
Washington,
I
am
not
giving
you
a
choice
in
the
matter.
I
want
to
know
what
it
says."
Sato's
BlackBerry
pinged
loudly,
and
she
yanked
the
device
from
her
pocket,
studying
the
incoming
message
for
several
moments.
Langdon
was
amazed
that
the
Capitol
Building's
internal
wireless
network
provided
service
this
far
down.
Sato
grunted
and
raised
her
eyebrows,
giving
Langdon
an
odd
look.
"Chief
Anderson?"
she
said,
turning
to
him.
"A
word
in
private,
if
I
may?"
The
director
motioned
for
Anderson
to
join
her,
and
they
disappeared
into
the
pitch-black
hallway,
leaving
Langdon
alone
in
the
flickering
candlelight
of
Peter'
s
Chamber
of
Reflection.
Chief
Anderson
wondered
when
this
night
would
end.
A
severed
hand
in
my
Rotunda?
A
death
shrine
in
my
basement?
Bizarre
engravings
on
a
stone
pyramid?
Somehow,
the
Redskins
game
no
longer
felt
significant.
As
he
followed
Sato
into
the
darkness
of
the
hall,
Anderson
flicked
on
his
flashlight.
The
beam
was
weak
but
better
than
nothing.
Sato
led
him
down
the
hall
a
few
yards,
out
of
sight
of
Langdon.
"Have
a
look
at
this,"
she
whispered,
handing
Anderson
her
BlackBerry.
Anderson
took
the
device
and
squinted
at
the
illuminated
screen.
It
displayed
a
black-and-white
image
the
X-ray
of
Langdon'
s
bag
that
Anderson
had
requested
be
sent
to
Sato.
As
in
all
X-rays,
the
objects
of
greatest
density
appeared
in
the
brightest
white.
In
Langdon'
s
bag,
a
lone
item
outshone
everything
else.
Obviously
extremely
dense,
the
object
glowed
like
a
dazzling
jewel
in
a
murky
jumble
of
other
items.
Its
shape
was
unmistakable.
He's
been
carrying
that
all
night?
Anderson
looked
over
at
Sato
in
surprise.
"Why
didn't
Langdon
mention
this?"
"Damned
good
question,"
Sato
whispered.
"The
shape
it
can't
be
coincidence."
"No,"
Sato
said,
her
tone
angry
now.
"I
would
say
not."
A
faint
rustle
in
the
corridor
drew
Anderson's
attention.
Startled,
he
pointed
his
flashlight
down
the
black
passageway.
The
dying
beam
revealed
only
a
deserted
corridor,
lined
with
open
doors.
"Hello?"
Anderson
said.
"Is
somebody
there?"
Silence.
Sato
gave
him
an
odd
look,
apparently
having
heard
nothing.
Anderson
listened
a
moment
longer
and
then
shook
it
off.
I've
got
to
get
out
of
here.
Alone
in
the
candlelit
chamber,
Langdon
ran
his
fingers
over
the
sharply
carved
edges
of
the
pyramid's
engraving.
He
was
curious
to
know
what
the
message
said,
and
yet
he
was
not
about
to
intrude
on
Peter
Solomon's
privacy
any
more
than
they
already
had.
And
why
would
this
lunatic
care
about
this
small
pyramid
anyway?
"We
have
a
problem,
Professor,"
Sato's
voice
declared
loudly
behind
him.
"I've
just
received
a
new
piece
of
information,
and
I've
had
enough
of
your
lies."
Langdon
turned
to
see
the
OS
director
marching
in,
BlackBerry
in
hand
and
fire
in
her
eyes.
Taken
aback,
Langdon
looked
to
Anderson
for
help,
but
the
chief
was
now
standing
guard
at
the
door,
his
expression
unsympathetic.
Sato
arrived
in
front
of
Langdon
and
thrust
her
BlackBerry
in
his
face.
Bewildered,
Langdon
looked
at
the
screen,
which
displayed
an
inverted
black-and-white
photograph,
like
a
ghostly
film
negative.
The
photo
looked
like
a
jumble
of
objects,
and
one
of
them
shone
very
brightly.
Though
askew
and
off
center,
the
brightest
object
was
clearly
a
little,
pointed
pyramid.
A
tiny
pyramid?
Langdon
looked
at
Sato.
"What
is
this?"
The
question
seemed
only
to
incense
Sato
further.
"You're
pretending
you
don't
know?"
Langdon's
temper
flared.
"I'm
not
pretending
anything!
I've
never
seen
this
before
in
my
life!"
"Bullshit!"
Sato
snapped,
her
voice
cutting
through
the
musty
air.
"You've
been
carrying
it
in
your
bag
all
night!"
"I
Langdon
stalled
midsentence.
His
eyes
moved
slowly
down
to
the
daybag
on
his
shoulder.
Then
he
raised
them
again
to
the
BlackBerry.
My
God
the
package.
He
looked
more
closely
at
the
image.
Now
he
saw
it.
A
ghostly
cube,
enclosing
the
pyramid.
Stunned,
Langdon
realized
he
was
looking
at
an
X-ray
of
his
bag
and
also
of
Peter's
mysterious
cube-shaped
package.
The
cube
was,
in
fact,
a
hollow
box
a
small
pyramid.
Langdon
opened
his
mouth
to
speak,
but
his
words
failed
him.
He
felt
the
breath
go
out
of
his
lungs
as
a
new
revelation
struck
him.
Simple.
Pure.
Devastating.
My
God.
He
looked
back
at
the
truncated
stone
pyramid
on
the
desk.
Its
apex
was
flat
a
small
square
area
a
blank
space
symbolically
awaiting
its
final
piece
that
piece
which
would
transform
it
from
an
Unfinished
Pyramid
into
a
True
Pyramid.
Langdon
now
realized
the
tiny
pyramid
he
was
carrying
was
not
a
pyramid
at
all.
It's
a
capstone.
At
that
instant,
he
knew
why
he
alone
could
unlock
the
mysteries
of
this
pyramid.
/
hold
the
final
piece.
And
it
is
indeed
a
talisman.
When
Peter
had
told
Langdon
the
package
contained
a
talisman,
Langdon
had
laughed.
Now
he
realized
his
friend
was
right.
This
tiny
capstone
was
a
talisman,
but
not
the
magic
kind
the
far
older
kind.
Long
before
talisman
had
magical
connotations,
it
had
another
meaning
"completion."
From
the
Greek
telesma,
meaning
"complete,"
a
talisman
was
any
object
or
idea
that
completed
another
and
made
it
whole.
The
finishing
element.
A
capstone,
symbolically
speaking,
was
the
ultimate
talisman,
transforming
the
Unfinished
Pyramid
into
a
symbol
of
completed
perfection.
Langdon
now
felt
an
eerie
convergence
that
forced
him
to
accept
one
very
strange
truth:
with
the
exception
of
its
size,
the
stone
pyramid
in
Peter's
Chamber
of
Reflection
seemed
to
be
transforming
itself,
bit
by
bit,
into
something
vaguely
resembling
the
Masonic
Pyramid
of
legend.
From
the
brightness
with
which
the
capstone
shone
on
the
X-ray,
Langdon
suspected
it
was
made
of
metal
.
.
.
a
very
dense
metal.
Whether
or
not
it
was
solid
gold,
he
had
no
way
of
knowing,
and
he
was
not
about
to
let
his
mind
start
playing
tricks
on
him.
This
pyramid
is
too
small.
The
code's
too
easy
to
read.
And
it's
a
myth,
for
heaven
's
sake!
Sato
was
watching
him.
"For
a
bright
man,
Professor,
you've
made
some
dumb
choices
tonight.
Lying
to
an
intelligence
director?
Intentionally
obstructing
a
CIA
investigation?"
"I
can
explain,
if
you'll
let
me."
"You
will
be
explaining
at
CIA
headquarters.
As
of
this
moment,
I
am
detaining
you."
Langdon'
s
body
went
rigid.
"You
can't
possibly
be
serious."
"Deadly
serious.
I
made
it
very
clear
to
you
that
the
stakes
tonight
were
high,
and
you
chose
not
to
cooperate.
I
strongly
suggest
you
start
thinking
about
explaining
the
inscription
on
this
pyramid,
because
when
we
arrive
at
the
CIA"
She
raised
her
BlackBerry
and
took
a
close-up
snapshot
of
the
engraving
on
the
stone
pyramid.
"My
analysts
will
have
had
a
head
start."
Langdon
opened
his
mouth
to
protest,
but
Sato
was
already
turning
to
Anderson
at
the
door.
"Chief,"
she
said,
"put
the
stone
pyramid
in
Langdon'
s
bag
and
carry
it.
I'll
handle
taking
Mr.
Langdon
into
custody.
Your
weapon,
if
I
may?"
Anderson
was
stone-faced
as
he
advanced
into
the
chamber,
unsnapping
his
shoulder
holster
as
he
came.
He
gave
his
gun
to
Sato,
who
immediately
aimed
it
at
Langdon.
Langdon
watched
as
if
in
a
dream.
This
cannot
be
happening.
Anderson
now
came
to
Langdon
and
removed
the
daybag
from
his
shoulder,
carrying
it
over
to
the
desk
and
setting
it
on
the
chair.
He
unzipped
the
bag,
propped
it
open,
and
then
hoisted
the
heavy
stone
pyramid
off
the
desk
and
into
the
bag,
along
with
Langdon'
s
notes
and
the
tiny
package.
Suddenly
there
was
a
rustle
of
movement
in
the
hallway.
A
dark
outline
of
a
man
materialized
in
the
doorway,
rushing
into
the
chamber
and
approaching
fast
behind
Anderson.
The
chief
never
saw
him
coming.
In
an
instant,
the
stranger
had
lowered
his
shoulder
and
crashed
into
Anderson's
back.
The
chief
launched
forward,
his
head
cracking
into
the
edge
of
the
stone
niche.
He
fell
hard,
crumpling
on
the
desk,
sending
bones
and
artifacts
flying.
The
hourglass
shattered
on
the
floor.
The
candle
toppled
to
the
floor,
still
burning.
Sato
reeled
amid
the
chaos,
raising
the
gun,
but
the
intruder
grabbed
a
femur
and
lashed
out
with
it,
striking
her
shoulder
with
the
leg
bone.
Sato
let
out
a
cry
of
pain
and
fell
back,
dropping
the
weapon.
The
newcomer
kicked
the
gun
away
and
then
wheeled
toward
Langdon.
The
man
was
tall
and
slender,
an
elegant
African
American
whom
Langdon
had
never
seen
before
in
his
life.
"Grab
the
pyramid!"
the
man
commanded.
"Follow
me!"
The
African
American
man
leading
Langdon
through
the
Capitol's
subterranean
maze
was
clearly
someone
of
power.
Beyond
knowing
his
way
through
all
the
side
corridors
and
back
rooms,
the
elegant
stranger
carried
a
key
ring
that
seemed
to
unlock
every
door
that
blocked
their
way.
Langdon
followed,
quickly
running
up
an
unfamiliar
staircase.
As
they
climbed,
he
felt
the
leather
strap
of
his
daybag
cutting
hard
into
his
shoulder.
The
stone
pyramid
was
so
heavy
that
Langdon
feared
the
bag's
strap
might
break.
The
past
few
minutes
defied
all
logic,
and
now
Langdon
found
himself
moving
on
instinct
alone.
His
gut
told
him
to
trust
this
stranger.
Beyond
saving
Langdon
from
Sato's
arrest,
the
man
had
taken
dangerous
action
to
protect
Peter
Solomon's
mysterious
pyramid.
Whatever
the
pyramid
may
be.
While
his
motivation
remained
a
mystery,
Langdon
had
glimpsed
a
telltale
shimmer
of
gold
on
the
man's
hand
a
Masonic
ring
the
double-headed
phoenix
and
the
number
33.
This
man
and
Peter
Solomon
were
more
than
trusted
friends.
They
were
Masonic
brothers
of
the
highest
degree.
Langdon
followed
him
to
the
top
of
the
stairs,
into
another
corridor,
and
then
through
an
unmarked
door
into
a
utilitarian
hallway.
They
ran
past
supply
boxes
and
bags
of
garbage,
veering
off
suddenly
through
a
service
door
that
deposited
them
in
an
utterly
unexpected
world
a
plush
movie
theater
of
some
sort.
The
older
man
led
the
way
up
the
side
aisle
and
out
the
main
doors
into
the
light
of
a
large
atrium.
Langdon
now
realized
they
were
in
the
visitor
center
through
which
he
had
entered
earlier
tonight.
Unfortunately,
so
was
a
Capitol
police
officer.
As
they
came
face-to-face
with
the
officer,
all
three
men
stopped,
staring
at
one
another.
Langdon
recognized
the
young
Hispanic
officer
from
the
X-ray
machine
earlier
tonight.
"Officer
Nunez,"
the
African
American
man
said.
"Not
a
word.
Follow
me."
The
guard
looked
uneasy
but
obeyed
without
question.
Who
is
this
guy?
The
three
of
them
hurried
toward
the
southeast
corner
of
the
visitor
center,
where
they
arrived
at
a
small
foyer
and
a
set
of
heavy
doors
blocked
with
orange
pylons.
The
doors
were
sealed
with
masking
tape,
apparently
to
keep
the
dust
of
whatever
was
happening
beyond
out
of
the
visitor
center.
The
man
reached
up
and
peeled
off
the
tape
on
the
door.
Then
he
flipped
through
his
key
ring
as
he
spoke
to
the
guard.
"Our
friend
Chief
Anderson
is
in
the
subbasement.
He
may
be
injured.
You'll
want
to
check
on
him."
"Yes,
sir."
Nunez
looked
as
baffled
as
he
did
alarmed.
"Most
important,
you
did
not
see
us."
The
man
found
a
key,
took
it
off
the
key
ring,
and
used
it
to
turn
the
heavy
dead
bolt.
He
pulled
open
the
steel
door
and
tossed
the
key
to
the
guard.
"Lock
this
door
behind
us.
Put
the
tape
back
on
as
best
as
you
can.
Pocket
the
key
and
say
nothing.
To
anyone.
Including
the
chief.
Is
that
clear,
Officer
Nunez?"
The
guard
eyed
the
key
as
if
he'd
just
been
entrusted
with
a
precious
gem.
"It
is,
sir."
The
man
hurried
through
the
door,
and
Langdon
followed.
The
guard
locked
the
heavy
bolt
behind
them,
and
Langdon
could
hear
him
re-applying
the
masking
tape.
"Professor
Langdon,"
the
man
said
as
they
strode
briskly
down
a
modern-
looking
corridor
that
was
obviously
under
construction.
"My
name
is
Warren
Bellamy.
Peter
Solomon
is
a
dear
friend
of
mine."
Langdon
shot
a
startled
glance
at
the
stately
man.
You're
Warren
Bellamy?
Langdon
had
never
met
the
Architect
of
the
Capitol,
but
he
certainly
knew
the
man'
s
name.
"Peter
speaks
very
highly
of
you,"
Bellamy
said,
"and
I'm
sorry
we
are
meeting
under
these
dreadful
circumstances."
"Peter
is
in
terrible
trouble.
His
hand"
"I
know."
Bellamy
sounded
grim.
"That's
not
the
half
of
it,
I'm
afraid."
They
reached
the
end
of
the
lit
section
of
corridor,
and
the
passageway
took
an
abrupt
left.
The
remaining
length
of
corridor,
wherever
it
went,
was
pitch-black.
"Hold
on,"
Bellamy
said,
disappearing
into
a
nearby
electrical
room
from
which
a
tangle
of
heavy-duty
orange
extension
cords
snaked
out,
running
away
from
them
into
the
darkness
of
the
corridor.
Langdon
waited
while
Bellamy
rooted
around
inside.
The
Architect
must
have
located
the
switch
that
sent
power
to
the
extension
cords,
because
suddenly
the
route
before
them
became
illuminated.
Langdon
could
only
stare.
Washington,
D.C.
like
Rome
was
a
city
laced
with
secret
passageways
and
underground
tunnels.
The
passage
before
them
now
reminded
Langdon
of
the
passetto
tunnel
connecting
the
Vatican
to
Castel
Sant'Angelo.
Long.
Dark.
Narrow.
Unlike
the
ancient
passetto,
however,
this
passage
was
modern
and
not
yet
complete.
It
was
a
slender
construction
zone
that
was
so
long
it
seemed
to
narrow
to
nothing
at
its
distant
end.
The
only
lighting
was
a
string
of
intermittent
construction
bulbs
that
did
little
more
than
accentuate
the
tunnel's
impossible
length.
Bellamy
was
already
heading
down
the
passage.
"Follow
me.
Watch
your
step."
Langdon
felt
himself
fall
into
step
behind
Bellamy,
wondering
where
on
earth
this
tunnel
led.
At
that
moment,
Mal'akh
stepped
out
of
Pod
3
and
strode
briskly
down
the
deserted
main
corridor
of
the
SMSC
toward
Pod
5.
He
clutched
Trish's
key
card
in
his
hand
and
quietly
whispered,
"Zero-eight-
zero-
four."
Something
else
was
cycling
through
his
mind
as
well.
Mal'akh
had
just
received
an
urgent
message
from
the
Capitol
Building.
My
contact
has
run
into
unforeseen
difficulties.
Even
so,
the
news
remained
encouraging:
Robert
Langdon
now
possessed
both
the
pyramid
and
the
capstone.
Despite
the
unexpected
way
in
which
it
had
happened,
the
crucial
pieces
were
falling
into
place.
It
was
almost
as
if
destiny
itself
were
guiding
tonight's
events,
ensuring
Mal'akh's
victory.
Langdon
hurried
to
keep
pace
with
Warren
Bellamy's
brisk
footsteps
as
they
moved
without
a
word
down
the
long
tunnel.
So
far,
the
Architect
of
the
Capitol
appeared
far
more
intent
on
putting
distance
between
Sato
and
this
stone
pyramid
than
he
did
on
explaining
to
Langdon
what
was
going
on.
Langdon
had
a
growing
apprehension
that
there
was
far
more
going
on
than
he
could
imagine.
The
CIA?
The
Architect
of
the
Capitol?
Two
Thirty-third-degree
Masons?
The
shrill
sound
of
Langdon'
s
cell
phone
cut
the
air.
He
pulled
his
phone
from
his
jacket.
Uncertain,
he
answered.
"Hello?"
The
voice
that
spoke
was
an
eerie,
familiar
whisper.
"Professor,
I
hear
you
had
unexpected
company."
Langdon
felt
an
icy
chill.
"Where
the
hell
is
Peter?!"
he
demanded,
his
words
reverberating
in
the
enclosed
tunnel.
Beside
him,
Warren
Bellamy
glanced
over,
looking
concerned
and
motioning
for
Langdon
to
keep
walking.
"Don't
worry,"
the
voice
said.
"As
I
told
you,
Peter
is
somewhere
safe."
"You
cut
off
his
hand,
for
God's
sake!
He
needs
a
doctor!"
"He
needs
a
priest,"
the
man
replied.
"But
you
can
save
him.
If
you
do
as
I
command,
Peter
will
live.
I
give
you
my
word."
"The
word
of
a
madman
means
nothing
to
me."
"Madman?
Professor,
surely
you
appreciate
the
reverence
with
which
I
have
adhered
to
the
ancient
protocols
tonight.
The
Hand
of
the
Mysteries
guided
you
to
a
portal
the
pyramid
that
promises
to
unveil
ancient
wisdom.
I
know
you
now
possess
it."
"You
think
this
is
the
Masonic
Pyramid?"
Langdon
demanded.
"It's
a
chunk
of
rock."
There
was
silence
on
the
other
end
of
the
line.
"Mr.
Langdon,
you're
too
smart
to
play
dumb.
You
know
very
well
what
you've
uncovered
tonight.
A
stone
pyramid
hidden
at
the
core
of
Washington,
D.C.
by
a
powerful
Mason?"
"You're
chasing
a
mythl
Whatever
Peter
told
you,
he
told
you
in
fear.
The
Legend
of
the
Masonic
Pyramid
is
fiction.
The
Masons
never
built
any
pyramid
to
protect
secret
wisdom.
And
even
if
they
did,
this
pyramid
is
far
too
small
to
be
what
you
think
it
is."
The
man
chuckled.
"I
see
Peter
has
told
you
very
little.
Nonetheless,
Mr.
Langdon,
whether
or
not
you
choose
to
accept
what
it
is
you
now
possess,
you
will
do
as
I
say.
I
am
well
aware
that
the
pyramid
you
are
carrying
has
an
encrypted
engraving.
You
will
decipher
that
engraving
for
me.
Then,
and
only
then,
will
I
return
Peter
Solomon
to
you."
"Whatever
you
believe
this
engraving
reveals,"
Langdon
said,
"it
won't
be
the
Ancient
Mysteries."
"Of
course
not,"
he
replied.
"The
mysteries
are
far
too
vast
to
be
written
on
the
side
of
a
little
stone
pyramid."
The
response
caught
Langdon
off
guard.
"But
if
this
engraving
is
not
the
Ancient
Mysteries,
then
this
pyramid
is
not
the
Masonic
Pyramid.
Legend
clearly
states
the
Masonic
Pyramid
was
constructed
to
protect
the
Ancient
Mysteries."
The
man's
tone
was
condescending
now.
"Mr.
Langdon,
the
Masonic
Pyramid
was
constructed
to
preserve
the
Ancient
Mysteries,
but
with
a
twist
you've
apparently
not
yet
grasped.
Did
Peter
never
tell
you?
The
power
of
the
Masonic
Pyramid
is
not
that
it
reveals
the
mysteries
themselves
but
rather
that
it
reveals
the
secret
location
where
the
mysteries
are
buried."
Langdon
did
a
double
take.
"Decipher
the
engraving,"
the
voice
continued,
"and
it
will
tell
you
the
hiding
place
of
mankind's
greatest
treasure."
He
laughed.
"Peter
did
not
entrust
you
with
the
treasure
itself,
Professor."
Langdon
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
in
the
tunnel.
"Hold
on.
You're
saying
this
pyramid
is
a
mapl
"
Bellamy
jolted
to
a
stop
now,
too,
his
expression
one
of
shock
and
alarm.
Clearly,
the
caller
had
just
hit
a
raw
nerve.
The
pyramid
is
a
map.
"This
map,"
the
voice
whispered,
"or
pyramid,
or
portal,
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
was
created
long
ago
to
ensure
the
hiding
place
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries
would
never
be
forgotten
that
it
would
never
be
lost
to
history."
"A
grid
of
sixteen
symbols
doesn't
look
much
like
a
map."
"Appearances
can
be
deceiving,
Professor.
But
regardless,
you
alone
have
the
power
to
read
that
inscription."
"You're
wrong,"
Langdon
fired
back,
picturing
the
simplistic
cipher.
"Anyone
could
decipher
this
engraving.
It's
not
very
sophisticated."
"I
suspect
there
is
more
to
the
pyramid
than
meets
the
eye.
Regardless,
you
alone
possess
the
capstone."
Langdon
pictured
the
little
capstone
in
his
bag.
Order
from
chaos?
He
didn't
know
what
to
believe
anymore,
but
the
stone
pyramid
in
his
bag
seemed
to
be
getting
heavier
with
every
passing
moment.
Mal'akh
pressed
the
cell
phone
to
his
ear,
enjoying
the
sound
of
Langdon'
s
anxious
breathing
on
the
other
end.
"Right
now,
I
have
business
to
attend
to,
Professor,
and
so
do
you.
Call
me
as
soon
as
you
have
deciphered
the
map.
We
will
go
together
to
the
hiding
place
and
make
our
trade.
Peter's
life
for
all
the
wisdom
of
the
ages."
"I
will
do
nothing"
Langdon
declared.
"Especially
not
without
proof
Peter
is
alive."
"I
suggest
you
not
test
me.
You
are
a
very
small
cog
in
a
vast
machine.
If
you
disobey
me,
or
attempt
to
find
me,
Peter
will
die.
This
I
swear."
"For
all
I
know,
Peter
is
already
dead."
"He
is
very
much
alive,
Professor,
but
he
desperately
needs
your
help."
"What
are
you
really
looking
for?"
Langdon
shouted
into
the
phone.
Mal'akh
paused
before
answering.
"Many
people
have
pursued
the
Ancient
Mysteries
and
debated
their
power.
Tonight,
I
will
prove
the
mysteries
are
real."
Langdon
was
silent.
"I
suggest
you
get
to
work
on
the
map
immediately,"
Mal'akh
said.
"I
need
this
information
today.'"
"Today?!
It's
already
after
nine
o'clock!"
"Exactly.
Tempus
fugit."
New
York
editor
Jonas
Faukman
was
just
turning
off
the
lights
in
his
Manhattan
office
when
his
phone
rang.
He
had
no
intention
of
picking
up
at
this
hour
that
is,
until
he
glimpsed
the
caller-ID
display.
This
ought
to
be
good,
he
thought,
reaching
for
the
receiver.
"Do
we
still
publish
you?"
Faukman
asked,
half
serious.
"Jonas!"
Robert
Langdon's
voice
sounded
anxious.
"Thank
God
you're
there.
I
need
your
help."
Faukman'
s
spirits
lifted.
"You've
got
pages
for
me
to
edit,
Robert?"
Finally?
"No,
I
need
information.
Last
year,
I
connected
you
with
a
scientist
named
Katherine
Solomon,
the
sister
of
Peter
Solomon?"
Faukman
frowned.
No
pages.
"She
was
looking
for
a
publisher
for
a
book
on
Noetic
Science?
Do
you
remember
her?"
Faukman
rolled
his
eyes.
"Sure.
I
remember.
And
thanks
a
million
for
that
introduction.
Not
only
did
she
refuse
to
let
me
read
the
results
of
her
research,
she
didn't
want
to
publish
anything
until
some
magical
date
in
the
future."
"Jonas,
listen
to
me,
I
don't
have
time.
I
need
Katherine'
s
phone
number.
Right
now.
Do
you
have
it?"
"I've
got
to
warn
you
you're
acting
a
little
desperate.
She's
great
looking,
but
you're
not
going
to
impress
her
by
"This
is
no
joke,
Jonas,
I
need
her
number
now."
"All
right
hold
on."
Faukman
and
Langdon
had
been
close
friends
for
enough
years
that
Faukman
knew
when
Langdon
was
serious.
Jonas
typed
the
name
Katherine
Solomon
into
a
search
window
and
began
scanning
the
company's
e-mail
server.
"I'm
looking
now,"
Faukman
said.
"And
for
what
it's
worth,
when
you
call
her,
you
may
not
want
to
call
from
the
Harvard
Pool.
It
sounds
like
you're
in
an
asylum."
"I'm
not
at
the
pool.
I'm
in
a
tunnel
under
the
U.S.
Capitol."
Faukman
sensed
from
Langdon's
voice
that
he
was
not
joking.
What
is
it
with
this
guy?
"Robert,
why
can't
you
just
stay
home
and
writeV
His
computer
pinged.
"Okay,
hold
on
I
got
it."
He
moused
through
the
old
e-mail
thread.
"It
looks
like
all
I
have
is
her
cell."
"I'll
take
it."
Faukman
gave
him
the
number.
"Thanks,
Jonas,"
Langdon
said,
sounding
grateful.
"I
owe
you
one."
"You
owe
me
a
manuscript,
Robert.
Do
you
have
any
idea
how
long
The
line
went
dead.
Faukman
stared
at
the
receiver
and
shook
his
head.
Book
publishing
would
be
so
much
easier
without
the
authors.
Katherine
Solomon
did
a
double
take
when
she
saw
the
name
on
her
caller
ID.
She
had
imagined
the
incoming
call
was
from
Trish,
checking
in
to
explain
why
she
and
Christopher
Abaddon
were
taking
so
long.
But
the
caller
was
not
Trish.
Far
from
it.
Katherine
felt
a
blushing
smile
cross
her
lips.
Could
tonight
get
any
stranger?
She
flipped
open
her
phone.
"Don't
tell
me,"
she
said
playfully.
"Bookish
bachelor
seeking
single
Noetic
Scientist?"
"Katherine!"
The
deep
voice
belonged
to
Robert
Langdon.
"Thank
God
you're
okay."
"Of
course
I'm
okay,"
she
replied,
puzzled.
"Other
than
the
fact
that
you
never
called
me
after
that
party
at
Peter's
house
last
summer."
"Something
has
happened
tonight.
Please
listen."
His
normally
smooth
voice
sounded
ragged.
"I'm
so
sorry
to
have
to
tell
you
this
but
Peter
is
in
serious
trouble."
Katherine'
s
smile
disappeared.
"What
are
you
talking
about?"
"Peter"
Langdon
hesitated
as
if
searching
for
words.
"I
don't
know
how
to
say
it,
but
he's
been
taken.
I'm
not
sure
how
or
by
whom,
but
"Taken?"
Katherine
demanded.
"Robert,
you're
scaring
me.
Taken
where?"
"Taken
captive."
Langdon's
voice
cracked
as
if
he
were
overwhelmed.
"It
must
have
happened
earlier
today
or
maybe
yesterday."
"This
isn't
funny,"
she
said
angrily.
"My
brother
is
fine.
I
just
spoke
to
him
fifteen
minutes
ago!"
"You
did?!"
Langdon
sounded
stunned.
"Yes
!
He
just
texted
me
to
say
he
was
coming
to
the
lab."
"He
texted
you"
Langdon
thought
out
loud.
"But
you
didn't
actually
hear
his
voiceV
"No,
but"
"Listen
to
me.
The
text
you
received
was
not
from
your
brother.
Someone
has
Peter's
phone.
He's
dangerous.
Whoever
it
is
tricked
me
into
coming
to
Washington
tonight."
"Tricked
you?
You're
not
making
any
sense!"
"I
know,
I'm
so
sorry."
Langdon
seemed
uncharacteristically
disorientated.
"Katherine,
I
think
you
could
be
in
danger."
Katherine
Solomon
was
sure
that
Langdon
would
never
joke
about
something
like
this,
and
yet
he
sounded
like
he
had
lost
his
mind.
"I'm
fine,"
she
said.
"I'm
locked
inside
a
secure
building!"
"Read
me
the
message
you
got
from
Peter's
phone.
Please."
Bewildered,
Katherine
pulled
up
the
text
message
and
read
it
to
Langdon,
feeling
a
chill
as
she
came
to
the
final
part
referencing
Dr.
Abaddon.
'"If
available,
have
Dr.
Abaddon
join
us
inside.
I
trust
him
fully
"Oh
God"
Langdon'
s
voice
was
laced
with
fear.
"Did
you
invite
this
man
inside?"
"Yes!
My
assistant
just
went
out
to
the
lobby
to
get
him.
I
expect
them
back
any
"Katherine,
get
out!"
Langdon
yelled.
"Now!"
At
the
other
side
of
the
SMSC,
inside
the
security
room,
a
phone
began
ringing,
drowning
out
the
Redskins
game.
The
guard
reluctantly
pulled
out
his
earbuds
one
more
time.
"Lobby,"
he
answered.
"This
is
Kyle."
"Kyle,
it's
Katherine
Solomon!"
Her
voice
sounded
anxious,
out
of
breath.
"Ma'am,
your
brother
has
not
yet
"Where's
Trish?!"
she
demanded.
"Can
you
see
her
on
the
monitors?"
The
guard
rolled
his
chair
over
to
look
at
the
screens.
"She
hasn't
gotten
back
to
the
Cube
yet?"
"No!"
Katherine
shouted,
sounding
alarmed.
The
guard
now
realized
that
Katherine
Solomon
was
out
of
breath,
as
if
she
were
running.
What's
going
on
back
there?
The
guard
quickly
worked
the
video
joystick,
skimming
through
frames
of
digital
video
at
rapid
speed.
"Okay,
hold
on,
scrolling
through
playback
I've
got
Trish
with
your
guest

Wet
Pod
fast-forwarding
okay,

are

out
of
Wet
Pod
just
a
minute
ago
heading

He
cocked
his
head,
slowing
the
playback.
"Wait
a
minute.
That's
odd."
"What?"
"The
gentleman
came
out
of
Wet
Pod
alone."
"Trish
stayed
inside?"
"Yes,
it
looks
that
way.
I'm
watching
your
guest
now
he's
in
the
hall
on
his
own."
"Where
is
Trish?"
Katherine
asked
more
frantically.
"I
don't
see
her
on
the
video
feed,"
he
replied,
an
edge
of
anxiety
creeping
into
his
voice.
He
looked
back
at
the
screen
and
noticed
that
the
man's
jacket
sleeves
appeared
to
be
wet
all
the
way
up
to
his
elbows.
What
in
the
world
did
he
do
in
Wet
Pod?
The
guard
watched
as
the
man
began
to
move
purposefully
down
the
main
hallway
toward
Pod
5,
clutching
in
his
hand
what
looked
like
a
key
card.
The
guard
felt
the
hair
on
the
back
of
his
neck
stand
on
end.
"Ms.
Solomon,
we've
got
a
serious
problem."
Tonight
was
a
night
of
firsts
for
Katherine
Solomon.
In
two
years,
she
had
never
used
her
cell
phone
inside
the
void.
Nor
had
she
ever
crossed
the
void
at
a
dead
run.
At
the
moment,
however,
Katherine
had
a
cell
phone
pressed
to
her
ear
while
she
was
dashing
blindly
along
the
endless
length
of
carpet.
Each
time
she
felt
a
foot
stray
from
the
carpet,
she
corrected
back
to
center,
racing
on
through
the
sheer
darkness.
"Where
is
he
now?"
Katherine
asked
the
guard,
breathless.
"Checking
now,"
the
guard
replied.
"Fast-forwarding
okay,
here
he
is
walking
down
the
hall
moving
toward
Pod
Five"
Katherine
ran
harder,
hoping
to
reach
the
exit
before
she
got
trapped
back
here.
"How
long
until
he
gets
to
the
Pod
Five
entrance?"
The
guard
paused.
"Ma'am,
you
don't
understand.
I'm
still
fast-forwarding.
This
is
recorded
playback.
This
already
happened."
He
paused.
"Hold
on,
let
me
check
the
entry
event
monitor."
He
paused
and
then
said,
"Ma'am,
Ms.
Dunne's
key
card
shows
a
Pod
Five
entry
event
about
a
minute
ago."
Katherine
slammed
on
the
brakes,
sliding
to
a
halt
in
the
middle
of
the
abyss.
"He
already
unlocked
Pod
Five?"
she
whispered
into
the
phone.
The
guard
was
typing
frantically.
"Yes,
it
looks
like
he
entered
ninety
seconds
ago."
Katherine'
s
body
went
rigid.
She
stopped
breathing.
The
darkness
felt
suddenly
alive
all
around
her.
He
's
in
here
with
me.
In
an
instant,
Katherine
realized
that
the
only
light
in
the
entire
space
was
coming
from
her
cell
phone,
illuminating
the
side
of
her
face.
"Send
help,"
she
whispered
to
the
guard.
"And
get
to
Wet
Pod
to
help
Trish."
Then
she
quietly
closed
her
phone,
extinguishing
the
light.
Absolute
darkness
settled
around
her.
She
stood
stock-still
and
breathed
as
quietly
as
possible.
After
a
few
seconds,
the
pungent
scent
of
ethanol
wafted
out
of
the
darkness
in
front
of
her.
The
smell
got
stronger.
She
could
sense
a
presence,
only
a
few
feet
in
front
of
her
on
the
carpet.
In
the
silence,
the
pounding
of
Katherine
's
heart
seemed
loud
enough
to
give
her
away.
Silently,
she
stepped
out
of
her
shoes
and
inched
to
her
left,
sidestepping
off
the
carpet.
The
cement
felt
cold
under
her
feet.
She
took
one
more
step
to
clear
the
carpet.
One
of
her
toes
cracked.
It
sounded
like
a
gunshot
in
the
stillness.
Only
a
few
yards
away,
a
rustle
of
clothing
suddenly
came
at
her
out
of
the
darkness.
Katherine
bolted
an
instant
too
late
and
a
powerful
arm
snagged
her,
groping
in
the
darkness,
hands
violently
attempting
to
gain
purchase.
She
spun
away
as
a
viselike
grip
caught
her
lab
coat,
yanking
her
backward,
reeling
her
in.
Katherine
threw
her
arms
backward,
slithering
out
of
her
lab
coat
and
slipping
free.
Suddenly,
with
no
idea
anymore
which
way
was
out,
Katherine
Solomon
found
herself
dashing,
dead
blind,
across
an
endless
black
abyss.
Despite
containing
what
many
have
called
"the
most
beautiful
room
in
the
world,"
the
Library
of
Congress
is
known
less
for
its
breathtaking
splendor
than
for
its
vast
collections.
With
over
five
hundred
miles
of
shelves
enough
to
stretch
from
Washington,
D.C.,
to
Boston
it
easily
claims
the
title
of
largest
library
on
earth.
And
yet
still
it
expands,
at
a
rate
of
over
ten
thousand
items
per
day.
As
an
early
repository
for
Thomas
Jefferson's
personal
collection
of
books
on
science
and
philosophy,
the
library
stood
as
a
symbol
of
America's
commitment
to
the
dissemination
of
knowledge.
One
of
the
first
buildings
in
Washington
to
have
electric
lights,
it
literally
shone
like
a
beacon
in
the
darkness
of
the
New
World.
As
its
name
implies,
the
Library
of
Congress
was
established
to
serve
Congress,
whose
venerated
members
worked
across
the
street
in
the
Capitol
Building.
This
age-old
bond
between
library
and
Capitol
had
been
fortified
recently
by
the
construction
of
a
physical
connection
a
long
tunnel
beneath
Independence
Avenue
that
linked
the
two
buildings.
Tonight,
inside
this
dimly
lit
tunnel,
Robert
Langdon
followed
Warren
Bellamy
through
a
construction
zone,
trying
to
quell
his
own
deepening
concern
for
Katherine.
This
lunatic
is
at
her
lab?!
Langdon
didn't
even
want
to
imagine
why.
When
he
had
called
to
warn
her,
Langdon
had
told
Katherine
exactly
where
to
meet
him
before
they
hung
up.
How
much
longer
is
this
damned
tunnel?
His
head
ached
now,
a
roiling
torrent
of
interconnected
thoughts:
Katherine,
Peter,
the
Masons,
Bellamy,
pyramids,
ancient
prophecy
and
a
map.
Langdon
shook
it
all
off
and
pressed
on.
Bellamy
promised
me
answers.
When
the
two
men
finally
reached
the
end
of
the
passage,
Bellamy
guided
Langdon
through
a
set
of
double
doors
that
were
still
under
construction.
Finding
no
way
to
lock
the
unfinished
doors
behind
them,
Bellamy
improvised,
grabbing
an
aluminum
ladder
from
the
construction
supplies
and
leaning
it
precariously
against
the
outside
of
the
door.
Then
he
balanced
a
metal
bucket
on
top.
If
anyone
opened
the
door,
the
bucket
would
crash
loudly
to
the
floor.
That's
our
alarm
system?
Langdon
eyed
the
perched
bucket,
hoping
Bellamy
had
a
more
comprehensive
plan
for
their
safety
tonight.
Everything
had
happened
so
fast,
and
Langdon
was
only
now
starting
to
process
the
repercussions
of
his
fleeing
with
Bellamy.
I'm
a
fugitive
from
the
CIA.
Bellamy
led
the
way
around
a
corner,
where
the
two
men
began
ascending
a
wide
staircase
that
was
cordoned
off
with
orange
pylons.
Langdon'
s
daybag
weighed
him
down
as
he
climbed.
"The
stone
pyramid,"
he
said,
"I
still
don't
understand
"Not
here,"
Bellamy
interrupted.
"We'll
examine
it
in
the
light.
I
know
a
safe
place."
Langdon
doubted
such
a
place
existed
for
anyone
who
had
just
physically
assaulted
the
director
of
the
CIA'
s
Office
of
Security.
As
the
two
men
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs,
they
entered
a
wide
hallway
of
Italian
marble,
stucco,
and
gold
leaf.
The
hall
was
lined
with
eight
pairs
of
statues
all
depicting
the
goddess
Minerva.
Bellamy
pressed
on,
leading
Langdon
eastward,
through
a
vaulted
archway,
into
a
far
grander
space.
Even
in
the
dim,
after-hours
lighting,
the
library's
great
hall
shone
with
the
classical
grandeur
of
an
opulent
European
palace.
Seventy-five
feet
overhead,
stained-glass
skylights
glistened
between
paneled
beams
adorned
with
rare
"aluminum
leaf
a
metal
that
was
considered
to
be
more
precious
than
gold
at
one
time.
Beneath
that,
a
stately
course
of
paired
pillars
lined
the
second-floor
balcony,
accessible
by
two
magnificent
curling
staircases
whose
newel
posts
supported
giant
bronze
female
figures
raising
torches
of
enlightenment.
In
a
bizarre
attempt
to
reflect
this
theme
of
modern
enlightenment
and
yet
stay
within
the
decorative
register
of
Renaissance
architecture,
the
stairway
banisters
had
been
carved
with
cupidlike
putti
portrayed
as
modern
scientists.
An
angelic
electrician
holding
a
telephone?
A
cherubic
entomologist
with
a
specimen
box?
Langdon
wondered
what
Bernini
would
have
thought.
"We'll
talk
over
here,"
Bellamy
said,
leading
Langdon
past
the
bulletproof
display
cases
that
contained
the
library's
two
most
valuable
books
the
Giant
Bible
of
Mainz,
handwritten
in
the
1450s,
and
America's
copy
of
the
Gutenberg
Bible,
one
of
only
three
perfect
vellum
copies
in
the
world.
Fittingly,
the
vaulted
ceiling
overhead
bore
John
White
Alexander's
six-panel
painting
titled
The
Evolution
of
the
Book.
Bellamy
strode
directly
to
a
pair
of
elegant
double
doors
at
the
center
rear
of
the
east-corridor
wall.
Langdon
knew
what
room
lay
beyond
those
doors,
but
it
seemed
a
strange
choice
for
a
conversation.
Notwithstanding
the
irony
of
talking
in
a
space
filled
with
"Silence
Please"
signs,
this
room
hardly
seemed
like
a
"safe
place."
Located
dead
center
of
the
library's
cruciform-
shaped
floor
plan,
this
chamber
served
as
the
heart
of
the
building.
Hiding
in
here
was
like
breaking
into
a
cathedral
and
hiding
on
the
altar.
Nonetheless,
Bellamy
unlocked
the
doors,
stepped
into
the
darkness
beyond,
and
groped
for
the
lights.
When
he
flipped
the
switch,
one
of
America'
s
great
architectural
masterpieces
seemed
to
materialize
out
of
thin
air.
The
famous
reading
room
was
a
feast
for
the
senses.
A
voluminous
octagon
rose
160
feet
at
its
center,
its
eight
sides
finished
in
chocolate-brown
Tennessee
marble,
cream-colored
Siena
marble,
and
apple-red
Algerian
marble.
Because
it
was
lit
from
eight
angles,
no
shadows
fell
anywhere,
creating
the
effect
that
the
room
itself
was
glowing.
"Some
say
it's
the
most
striking
room
in
Washington,"
Bellamy
said,
ushering
Langdon
inside.
Maybe
in
the
whole
world,
Langdon
thought
as
he
stepped
across
the
threshold.
As
always,
his
gaze
first
ascended
straight
up
to
the
towering
central
collar,
where
rays
of
arabesque
coffers
curled
down
the
dome
to
an
upper
balcony.
Encircling
the
room,
sixteen
bronze
"portrait"
statues
peered
down
from
the
balustrade.
Beneath
them,
a
stunning
arcade
of
archways
formed
a
lower
balcony.
Down
at
floor
level,
three
concentric
circles
of
burnished
wood
desks
radiated
out
from
the
massive
octagonal
circulation
desk.
Langdon
returned
his
focus
to
Bellamy,
who
was
now
propping
the
room's
double
doors
wide
open.
"I
thought
we
were
hiding"
Langdon
said,
confused.
"If
anyone
enters
the
building,"
Bellamy
said,
"I
want
to
hear
them
coming."
"But
won't
they
find
us
instantly
in
here?"
"No
matter
where
we
hide,
they'll
find
us.
But
if
anyone
corners
us
in
this
building,
you'll
be
very
glad
I
chose
this
room."
Langdon
had
no
idea
why,
but
Bellamy
apparently
wasn't
looking
to
discuss
it.
He
was
already
on
the
move
toward
the
center
of
the
room,
where
he
selected
one
of
the
available
reading
desks,
pulled
up
two
chairs,
and
flipped
on
the
reading
light.
Then
he
motioned
to
Langdon'
s
bag.
"Okay,
Professor,
let's
have
a
closer
look."
Not
wanting
to
risk
scratching
its
polished
surface
with
a
rough
piece
of
granite,
Langdon
hoisted
his
entire
bag
onto
the
desk
and
unzipped
it,
folding
the
sides
all
the
way
down
to
reveal
the
pyramid
inside.
Warren
Bellamy
adjusted
the
reading
lamp
and
studied
the
pyramid
carefully.
He
ran
his
fingers
over
the
unusual
engraving.
"I
assume
you
recognize
this
language?"
Bellamy
asked.
"Of
course,"
Langdon
replied,
eyeing
the
sixteen
symbols.
Known
as
the
Freemason's
Cipher,
this
encoded
language
had
been
used
for
private
communication
among
early
Masonic
brothers.
The
encryption
method
had
been
abandoned
long
ago
for
one
simple
reason
it
was
much
too
easy
to
break.
Most
of
the
students
in
Langdon'
s
senior
symbology
seminar
could
break
this
code
in
about
five
minutes.
Langdon,
with
a
pencil
and
paper,
could
do
it
in
under
sixty
seconds.
The
notorious
breakability
of
this
centuries-old
encryption
scheme
now
presented
a
couple
of
paradoxes.
First,
the
claim
that
Langdon
was
the
only
person
on
earth
who
could
break
it
was
absurd.
Second,
for
Sato
to
suggest
that
a
Masonic
cipher
was
an
issue
of
national
security
was
like
her
suggesting
our
nuclear
launch
codes
were
encrypted
with
a
Cracker
Jack
decoder
ring.
Langdon
was
still
struggling
to
believe
any
of
it.
This
pyramid
is
a
map?
Pointing
to
the
lost
wisdom
of
the
ages?
"Robert,"
Bellamy
said,
his
tone
grave.
"Did
Director
Sato
tell
you
why
she
is
so
interested
in
this?"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"Not
specifically.
She
just
kept
saying
it
was
an
issue
of
national
security.
I
assume
she's
lying."
"Perhaps,"
Bellamy
said,
rubbing
the
back
of
his
neck.
He
seemed
to
be
struggling
with
something.
"But
there
is
a
far
more
troubling
possibility."
He
turned
to
look
Langdon
in
the
eye.
"It's
possible
that
Director
Sato
has
discovered
this
pyramid's
true
potential."
The
blackness
engulfing
Katherine
Solomon
felt
absolute.
Having
fled
the
familiar
safety
of
the
carpet,
she
was
now
groping
blindly
forward,
her
outstretched
hands
touching
only
empty
space
as
she
staggered
deeper
into
the
desolate
void.
Beneath
her
stockinged
feet,
the
endless
expanse
of
cold
cement
felt
like
a
frozen
lake
a
hostile
environment
from
which
she
now
needed
to
escape.
No
longer
smelling
ethanol,
she
stopped
and
waited
in
darkness.
Standing
dead
still,
she
listened,
willing
her
heart
to
stop
pounding
so
loudly.
The
heavy
footsteps
behind
her
seemed
to
have
stopped.
Did
I
lose
him?
Katherine
closed
her
eyes
and
tried
to
imagine
where
she
was.
Which
direction
did
I
run?
Where
is
the
door?
It
was
no
use.
She
was
so
turned
around
now
that
the
exit
could
be
anywhere.
Fear,
Katherine
had
once
heard,
acted
as
a
stimulant,
sharpening
the
mind's
ability
to
think.
Right
now,
however,
her
fear
had
turned
her
mind
into
a
tumbling
torrent
of
panic
and
confusion.
Even
if
I
find
the
exit,
I
can
't
get
out.
Her
key
card
had
been
lost
when
she'd
shed
her
lab
coat.
Her
only
hope
seemed
to
be
that
she
was
now
a
needle
in
a
haystack
a
single
point
on
a
thirty-thousand-square-foot
grid.
Despite
the
overwhelming
urge
to
flee,
Katherine'
s
analytical
mind
told
her
instead
to
make
the
only
logical
move
no
move
at
all.
Stay
still.
Don
't
make
a
sound.
The
security
guard
was
on
his
way,
and
for
some
unknown
reason,
her
attacker
smelled
strongly
of
ethanol.
If
he
gets
too
close,
I'll
know
it.
As
Katherine
stood
in
silence,
her
mind
raced
over
what
Langdon
had
said.
Your
brother
he's
been
taken.
She
felt
a
bead
of
cold
sweat
materialize
on
her
arm
and
trickle
down,
toward
the
cell
phone
still
clenched
in
her
right
hand.
It
was
a
danger
she
had
forgotten
to
consider.
If
the
phone
rang,
it
would
give
away
her
position,
and
she
could
not
turn
it
off
without
opening
it
and
illuminating
the
display.
Set
down
the
phone
and
move
away
from
it.
But
it
was
too
late.
The
smell
of
ethanol
approached
on
her
right.
And
now
it
grew
stronger.
Katherine
struggled
to
stay
calm,
forcing
herself
to
override
the
instinct
to
run.
Carefully,
slowly,
she
took
one
step
to
her
left.
The
faint
rustle
of
her
clothing
was
apparently
all
her
attacker
needed.
She
heard
him
lunge,
and
the
smell
of
ethanol
washed
over
her
as
a
powerful
hand
grabbed
at
her
shoulder.
She
twisted
away,
raw
terror
gripping
her.
Mathematical
probability
went
out
the
window,
and
Katherine
broke
into
a
blind
sprint.
She
veered
hard
to
the
left,
changing
course,
dashing
blindly
now
into
the
void.
The
wall
materialized
out
of
nowhere.
Katherine
hit
it
hard,
knocking
the
wind
from
her
lungs.
Pain
blossomed
in
her
arm
and
shoulder,
but
she
managed
to
stay
on
her
feet.
The
oblique
angle
at
which
she
had
collided
with
the
wall
had
spared
her
the
full
force
of
the
blow,
but
it
was
little
comfort
now.
The
sound
had
echoed
everywhere.
He
knows
where
I
am.
Doubled
over
in
pain,
she
turned
her
head
and
stared
out
into
the
blackness
of
the
pod
and
sensed
him
staring
back
at
her.
Change
your
location.
Now!
Still
struggling
to
catch
her
breath,
she
began
moving
down
the
wall,
touching
her
left
hand
quietly
to
each
exposed
steel
stud
as
she
passed.
Stay
along
the
wall.
Slip
past
him
before
he
corners
you.
In
her
right
hand,
Katherine
still
clutched
her
cell
phone,
ready
to
hurl
it
as
a
projectile
if
need
be.
Katherine
was
in
no
way
prepared
for
the
sound
she
heard
next
the
clear
rustle
of
clothing
directly
in
front
of
her
against
the
wall.
She
froze,
stock-still,
and
stopped
breathing.
How
could
he
be
on
the
wall
already?
She
felt
a
faint
puff
of
air,
laced
with
the
stench
of
ethanol.
He's
moving
down
the
wall
toward
me!
Katherine
backed
up
several
steps.
Then,
turning
silently
180
degrees,
she
began
moving
quickly
in
the
opposite
direction
down
the
wall.
She
moved
twenty
feet
or
so
when
the
impossible
happened.
Once
again,
directly
in
front
of
her,
along
the
wall,
she
heard
the
rustling
sound
of
clothing.
Then
came
the
same
puff
of
air
and
the
smell
of
ethanol.
Katherine
Solomon
froze
in
place.
My
God,
he
's
everywhere!
Bare-chested,
Mal'akh
stared
into
the
darkness.
The
smell
of
ethanol
on
his
sleeves
had
proven
a
liability,
and
so
he
had
transformed
it
into
an
asset,
stripping
off
his
shirt
and
jacket
and
using
them
to
help
corner
his
prey.
Throwing
his
jacket
against
the
wall
to
the
right,
he
had
heard
Katherine
stop
short
and
change
direction.
Now,
having
thrown
his
shirt
ahead
to
the
left,
Mal'akh
had
heard
her
stop
again.
He
had
effectively
corralled
Katherine
against
the
wall
by
establishing
points
beyond
which
she
dared
not
pass.
Now
he
waited,
ears
straining
in
the
silence.
She
has
only
one
direction
she
can
move
directly
toward
me.
Even
so,
Mal'akh
heard
nothing.
Either
Katherine
was
paralyzed
with
fear,
or
she
had
decided
to
stand
still
and
wait
for
help
to
enter
Pod
5.
Either
way
she
loses.
Nobody
would
be
entering
Pod
5
anytime
soon;
Mal'akh
had
disabled
the
outer
keypad
with
a
very
crude,
yet
very
effective,
technique.
After
using
Trish's
key
card,
he
had
rammed
a
single
dime
deep
into
the
key-card
slot
to
prevent
any
other
key-card
use
without
first
dismantling
the
entire
mechanism.
You
and
I
are
alone,
Katherine
for
as
long
as
this
takes.
Mal'akh
inched
silently
forward,
listening
for
any
movement.
Katherine
Solomon
would
die
tonight
in
the
darkness
of
her
brother's
museum.
A
poetic
end.
Mal'akh
looked
forward
to
sharing
the
news
of
Katherine'
s
death
with
her
brother.
The
old
man's
anguish
would
be
long-awaited
revenge.
Suddenly
in
the
darkness,
to
Mal'akh's
great
surprise,
he
saw
a
tiny
glow
in
the
distance
and
realized
Katherine
had
just
made
a
deadly
error
in
judgment.
She
's
phoning
for
help
?!
The
electronic
display
that
had
just
flickered
to
life
was
hovering
waist
high,
about
twenty
yards
ahead,
like
a
shining
beacon
on
a
vast
ocean
of
black.
Mal'akh
had
been
prepared
to
wait
Katherine
out,
but
now
he
wouldn't
have
to.
Mal'akh
sprang
into
motion,
racing
toward
the
hovering
light,
knowing
he
had
to
reach
her
before
she
could
complete
her
call
for
help.
He
was
there
in
a
matter
of
seconds,
and
he
lunged,
arms
outstretched
on
either
side
of
her
glowing
cell
phone,
preparing
to
engulf
her.
Mal'akh's
fingers
jammed
into
a
solid
wall,
bending
backward
and
almost
breaking.
His
head
collided
next,
crashing
into
a
steel
beam.
He
cried
out
in
pain
as
he
crumpled
beside
the
wall.
Cursing,
he
clambered
back
to
his
feet,
pulling
himself
up
by
the
waist-high,
horizontal
strut
on
which
Katherine
Solomon
had
cleverly
placed
her
open
cell
phone.
Katherine
was
running
again,
this
time
with
no
concern
for
the
noise
her
hand
was
making
as
it
bounced
rhythmically
off
the
evenly
spaced
metal
studs
of
Pod
5.
Run!
If
she
followed
the
wall
all
the
way
around
the
pod,
she
knew
that
sooner
or
later
she
would
feel
the
exit
door.
Where
the
hell
is
the
guard?
The
even
spacing
of
the
studs
continued
as
she
ran
with
her
left
hand
on
the
sidewall
and
her
right
out
in
front
of
her
for
protection.
When
will
I
reach
the
corner?
The
sidewall
seemed
to
go
on
and
on,
but
suddenly
the
rhythm
of
the
studs
was
broken.
Her
left
hand
hit
empty
space
for
several
long
strides,
and
then
the
studs
began
again.
Katherine
slammed
on
the
brakes
and
backed
up,
feeling
her
way
across
the
smooth
metal
panel.
Why
are
there
no
studs
here?
She
could
hear
her
attacker
lumbering
loudly
after
her
now,
groping
his
way
down
the
wall
in
her
direction.
Even
so,
it
was
a
different
sound
that
scared
Katherine
even
more
the
distant
rhythmic
banging
of
a
security
guard
pounding
his
flashlight
against
the
Pod
5
door.
The
guard
can
't
get
in
?
While
the
thought
was
terrifying,
the
location
of
his
banging
diagonally
to
her
right
instantly
oriented
Katherine.
She
could
now
picture
where
in
Pod
5
she
was
located.
The
visual
flash
brought
with
it
an
unexpected
realization.
She
now
knew
what
this
flat
panel
on
the
wall
was.
Every
pod
was
equipped
with
a
specimen
bay
a
giant
movable
wall
that
could
be
retracted
for
transporting
oversize
specimens
in
and
out
of
the
pods.
Like
those
of
an
airplane
hangar,
this
door
was
mammoth,
and
Katherine
in
her
wildest
dreams
had
never
imagined
needing
to
open
it.
At
the
moment,
though,
it
seemed
like
her
only
hope.
Is
it
even
operable?
Katherine
fumbled
blindly
in
the
blackness,
searching
the
bay
door
until
she
found
the
large
metal
handle.
Grasping
it,
she
threw
her
weight
backward,
trying
to
slide
open
the
door.
Nothing.
She
tried
again.
It
didn't
budge.
She
could
hear
her
attacker
closing
faster
now,
homing
in
on
the
sounds
of
her
efforts.
The
bay
door
is
locked!
Wild
with
panic,
she
slid
her
hands
all
over
the
door,
feeling
the
surface
for
any
latch
or
lever.
She
suddenly
hit
what
felt
like
a
vertical
pole.
She
followed
it
down
to
the
floor,
crouching,
and
could
feel
it
was
inserted
into
a
hole
in
the
cement.
A
security
rod!
She
stood
up,
grabbed
the
pole,
and,
lifting
with
her
legs,
slid
the
rod
up
and
out
of
the
hole.
He
's
almost
here!
Katherine
groped
now
for
the
handle,
found
it
again,
and
heaved
back
on
it
with
all
her
might.
The
massive
panel
seemed
barely
to
move,
and
yet
a
sliver
of
moonlight
now
sliced
into
Pod
5.
Katherine
pulled
again.
The
shaft
of
light
from
outside
the
building
grew
wider.
A
little
more!
She
pulled
one
last
time,
sensing
her
attacker
was
now
only
a
few
feet
away.
Leaping
toward
the
light,
Katherine
wriggled
her
slender
body
sideways
into
the
opening.
A
hand
materialized
in
the
darkness,
clawing
at
her,
trying
to
pull
her
back
inside.
She
heaved
herself
through
the
opening,
pursued
by
a
massive
bare
arm
that
was
covered
with
tattooed
scales.
The
terrifying
arm
writhed
like
an
angry
snake
trying
to
seize
her.
Katherine
spun
and
fled
down
the
long,
pale
outer
wall
of
Pod
5.
The
bed
of
loose
stones
that
surrounded
the
entire
perimeter
of
the
SMSC
cut
into
her
stockinged
feet
as
she
ran,
but
she
pressed
on,
heading
for
the
main
entrance.
The
night
was
dark,
but
with
her
eyes
fully
dilated
from
the
utter
blackness
of
Pod
5,
she
could
see
perfectly
almost
as
if
it
were
daylight.
Behind
her,
the
heavy
bay
door
ground
open,
and
she
heard
heavy
footsteps
accelerating
in
pursuit
down
the
side
of
the
building.
The
footsteps
seemed
impossibly
fast.
I'll
never
outrun
him
to
the
main
entrance.
She
knew
her
Volvo
was
closer,
but
even
that
would
be
too
far.
I'm
not
going
to
make
it.
Then
Katherine
realized
she
had
one
final
card
to
play.
As
she
neared
the
corner
of
Pod
5,
she
could
hear
his
footsteps
quickly
overtaking
her
in
the
darkness.
Now
or
never.
Instead
of
rounding
the
corner,
Katherine
suddenly
cut
hard
to
her
left,
away
from
the
building,
out
onto
the
grass.
As
she
did
so,
she
closed
her
eyes
tightly,
placed
both
hands
over
her
face,
and
began
running
totally
blind
across
the
lawn.
The
motion-activated
security
lighting
that
blazed
to
life
around
Pod
5
transformed
night
into
day
instantly.
Katherine
heard
a
scream
of
pain
behind
her
as
the
brilliant
floodlights
seared
into
her
assailant's
hyper
dilated
pupils
with
over
twenty-five-million
candlepower
of
light.
She
could
hear
him
stumbling
on
the
loose
stones.
Katherine
kept
her
eyes
tightly
closed,
trusting
herself
on
the
open
lawn.
When
she
sensed
she
was
far
enough
away
from
the
building
and
the
lights,
she
opened
her
eyes,
corrected
her
course,
and
ran
like
hell
through
the
dark.
Her
Volvo's
keys
were
exactly
where
she
always
left
them,
in
the
center
console.
Breathless,
she
seized
the
keys
in
her
trembling
hands
and
found
the
ignition.
The
engine
roared
to
life,
and
her
headlights
flipped
on,
illuminating
a
terrifying
sight.
A
hideous
form
raced
toward
her.
Katherine
froze
for
an
instant.
The
creature
caught
in
her
headlights
was
a
bald
and
bare-chested
animal,
its
skin
covered
with
tattooed
scales,
symbols,
and
text.
He
bellowed
as
he
ran
into
the
glare,
raising
his
hands
before
his
eyes
like
a
cave-
dwelling
beast
seeing
sunlight
for
the
first
time.
She
reached
for
the
gearshift
but
suddenly
he
was
there,
hurling
his
elbow
through
her
side
window,
sending
a
shower
of
safety
glass
into
her
lap.
A
massive
scale-covered
arm
burst
through
her
window,
groping
half
blind,
finding
her
neck.
She
threw
the
car
in
reverse,
but
her
attacker
had
latched
on
to
her
throat,
squeezing
with
unimaginable
force.
She
turned
her
head
in
an
attempt
to
escape
his
grasp,
and
suddenly
she
was
staring
at
his
face.
Three
dark
stripes,
like
fingernail
scratches,
had
torn
through
his
face
makeup
to
reveal
the
tattoos
beneath.
His
eyes
were
wild
and
ruthless.
"I
should
have
killed
you
ten
years
ago,"
he
growled.
"The
night
I
killed
your
mother."
As
his
words
registered,
Katherine
was
seized
by
a
horrifying
memory:
that
feral
look
in
his
eyes
she
had
seen
it
before.
It's
him.
She
would
have
screamed
had
it
not
been
for
the
viselike
grip
around
her
neck.
She
smashed
her
foot
onto
the
accelerator,
and
the
car
lurched
backward,
almost
snapping
her
neck
as
he
was
dragged
beside
her
car.
The
Volvo
careened
up
an
inclined
median,
and
Katherine
could
feel
her
neck
about
to
give
way
beneath
his
weight.
Suddenly
tree
branches
were
scraping
the
side
of
her
car,
slapping
through
the
side
windows,
and
the
weight
was
gone.
The
car
burst
through
the
evergreens
and
out
into
the
upper
parking
lot,
where
Katherine
slammed
on
the
brakes.
Below
her,
the
half-naked
man
clambered
to
his
feet,
staring
into
her
headlights.
With
a
terrifying
calm,
he
raised
a
menacing
scale-covered
arm
and
pointed
directly
at
her.
Katherine'
s
blood
coursed
with
raw
fear
and
hatred
as
she
spun
the
wheel
and
hit
the
gas.
Seconds
later,
she
was
fishtailing
out
onto
Silver
Hill
Road.
In
the
heat
of
the
moment,
Capitol
police
officer
Nunez
had
seen
no
option
but
to
help
the
Capitol
Architect
and
Robert
Langdon
escape.
Now,
however,
back
in
the
basement
police
headquarters,
Nunez
could
see
the
storm
clouds
gathering
fast.
Chief
Trent
Anderson
was
holding
an
ice
pack
to
his
head
while
another
officer
was
tending
to
Sato's
bruises.
Both
of
them
were
standing
with
the
video
surveillance
team,
reviewing
digital
playback
files
in
an
attempt
to
locate
Langdon
and
Bellamy.
"Check
the
playback
on
every
hallway
and
exit,"
Sato
demanded.
"I
want
to
know
where
they
went!"
Nunez
felt
ill
as
he
looked
on.
He
knew
it
would
be
only
a
matter
of
minutes
before
they
found
the
right
video
clip
and
learned
the
truth.
/
helped
them
escape.
Making
matters
worse
was
the
arrival
of
a
four-man
CIA
field
team
that
was
now
staging
nearby,
prepping
to
go
after
Langdon
and
Bellamy.
These
guys
looked
nothing
like
the
Capitol
Police.
These
guys
were
dead-serious
soldiers
black
camouflage,
night
vision,
futuristic-looking
handguns.
Nunez
felt
like
he
would
throw
up.
Making
up
his
mind,
he
motioned
discreetly
to
Chief
Anderson.
"A
word,
Chief?"
"What
is
it?"
Anderson
followed
Nunez
into
the
hall.
"Chief,
I
made
a
bad
mistake,"
Nunez
said,
breaking
a
sweat.
"I'm
sorry,
and
I'm
resigning."
You'll
fire
me
in
a
few
minutes
anyway.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
Nunez
swallowed
hard.
"Earlier,
I
saw
Langdon
and
Architect
Bellamy
in
the
visitor
center
on
their
way
out
of
the
building."
"What?!"
Anderson
bellowed.
"Why
didn't
you
say
something?!"
"The
Architect
told
me
not
to
say
a
word."
"You
work
for
me,
goddamm
it!"
Anderson's
voice
echoed
down
the
corridor.
"Bellamy
smashed
my
head
into
a
wall,
for
Christ's
sake!"
Nunez
handed
Anderson
the
key
that
the
Architect
had
given
him.
"What
is
this?"
Anderson
demanded.
"A
key
to
the
new
tunnel
under
Independence
Avenue.
Architect
Bellamy
had
it.
That's
how
they
escaped."
Anderson
stared
down
at
the
key,
speechless.
Sato
poked
her
head
out
into
the
hallway,
eyes
probing.
"What's
going
on
out
here?"
Nunez
felt
himself
go
pale.
Anderson
was
still
holding
the
key,
and
Sato
clearly
had
seen
it.
As
the
hideous
little
woman
drew
near,
Nunez
improvised
as
best
as
he
could,
hoping
to
protect
his
chief.
"I
found
a
key
on
the
floor
in
the
subbasement.
I
was
just
asking
Chief
Anderson
if
he
knew
what
it
might
go
to."
Sato
arrived,
eyeing
the
key.
"And
does
the
chief
know?"
Nunez
glanced
up
at
Anderson,
who
was
clearly
weighing
all
his
options
before
speaking.
Finally,
the
chief
shook
his
head.
"Not
offhand.
I'd
have
to
check
the
"Don't
bother,"
Sato
said.
"This
key
unlocks
a
tunnel
off
the
visitor
center."
"Really?"
Anderson
said.
"How
do
you
know
that?"
"We
just
found
the
surveillance
clip.
Officer
Nunez
here
helped
Langdon
and
Bellamy
escape
and
then
relocked
that
tunnel
door
behind
them.
Bellamy
gave
Nunez
that
key."
Anderson
turned
to
Nunez
with
a
flare
of
anger.
"Is
this
true?!"
Nunez
nodded
vigorously,
doing
his
best
to
play
along.
"I'm
sorry,
sir.
The
Architect
told
me
not
to
tell
a
soul!"
"I
don't
give
a
damn
what
the
Architect
told
you!"
Anderson
yelled.
"I
expect
"Shut
up,
Trent,"
Sato
snapped.
"You're
both
lousy
liars.
Save
it
for
your
CIA
inquisition."
She
snatched
the
Architect's
tunnel
key
from
Anderson.
"You're
done
here."
Robert
Langdon
hung
up
his
cell
phone,
feeling
increasingly
worried.
Katherine's
not
answering
her
cell?
Katherine
had
promised
to
call
him
as
soon
as
she
was
safely
out
of
the
lab
and
on
her
way
to
meet
him
here,
but
she
had
never
done
so.
Bellamy
sat
beside
Langdon
at
the
reading-room
desk.
He,
too,
had
just
made
a
call,
his
to
an
individual
he
claimed
could
offer
them
sanctuary
a
safe
place
to
hide.
Unfortunately,
this
person
was
not
answering
either,
and
so
Bellamy
had
left
an
urgent
message,
telling
him
to
call
Langdon'
s
cell
phone
right
away.
"I'll
keep
trying,"
he
said
to
Langdon,
"but
for
the
moment,
we're
on
our
own.
And
we
need
to
discuss
a
plan
for
this
pyramid."
The
pyramid.
For
Langdon,
the
spectacular
backdrop
of
the
reading
room
had
all
but
disappeared,
his
world
constricting
now
to
include
only
what
was
directly
in
front
of
him
a
stone
pyramid,
a
sealed
package
containing
a
capstone,
and
an
elegant
African
American
man
who
had
materialized
out
of
the
darkness
and
rescued
him
from
the
certainty
of
a
CIA
interrogation.
Langdon
had
expected
a
modicum
of
sanity
from
the
Architect
of
the
Capitol,
but
now
it
seemed
Warren
Bellamy
was
no
more
rational
than
the
madman
claiming
Peter
was
in
purgatory.
Bellamy
was
insisting
this
stone
pyramid
was,
in
fact,
the
Masonic
Pyramid
of
legend.
An
ancient
map?
That
guides
us
to
powerful
wisdom?
"Mr.
Bellamy,"
Langdon
said
politely,
"this
idea
that
there
exists
some
kind
of
ancient
knowledge
that
can
imbue
men
with
great
power
I
simply
can't
take
it
seriously."
Bellamy's
eyes
looked
both
disappointed
and
earnest,
making
Langdon'
s
skepticism
all
the
more
awkward.
"Yes,
Professor,
I
had
imagined
you
might
feel
this
way,
but
I
suppose
I
should
not
be
surprised.
You
are
an
outsider
looking
in.
There
exist
certain
Masonic
realities
that
you
will
perceive
as
myth
because
you
are
not
properly
initiated
and
prepared
to
understand
them."
Now
Langdon
felt
patronized.
/
wasn
't
a
member
of
Odysseus'
s
crew,
but
I'm
certain
the
Cyclops
is
a
myth.
"Mr.
Bellamy,
even
if
the
legend
is
true
this
pyramid
cannot
possibly
be
the
Masonic
Pyramid."
"No?"
Bellamy
ran
a
finger
across
the
Masonic
cipher
on
the
stone.
"It
looks
to
me
like
it
fits
the
description
perfectly.
A
stone
pyramid
with
a
shining
metal
capstone,
which,
according
to
Sato's
X-ray,
is
exactly
what
Peter
entrusted
to
you."
Bellamy
picked
up
the
little
cube-shaped
package,
weighing
it
in
his
hand.
"This
stone
pyramid
is
less
than
a
foot
tall,"
Langdon
countered.
"Every
version
of
the
story
I've
ever
heard
describes
the
Masonic
Pyramid
as
enormous."
Bellamy
had
clearly
anticipated
this
point.
"As
you
know,
the
legend
speaks
of
a
pyramid
rising
so
high
that
God
Himself
can
reach
out
and
touch
it."
"Exactly."
"I
can
see
your
dilemma,
Professor.
However,
both
the
Ancient
Mysteries
and
Masonic
philosophy
celebrate
the
potentiality
of
God
within
each
of
us.
Symbolically
speaking,
one
could
claim
that
anything
within
reach
of
an
enlightened
man
is
within
reach
of
God."
Langdon
felt
unswayed
by
the
wordplay.
"Even
the
Bible
concurs,"
Bellamy
said.
"If
we
accept,
as
Genesis
tells
us,
that
'God
created
man
in
his
own
image,'
then
we
also
must
accept
what
this
implies
that
mankind
was
not
created
inferior
to
God.
In
Luke
17:20
we
are
told,
'The
kingdom
of
God
is
within
you.'
"I'm
sorry,
but
I
don't
know
any
Christians
who
consider
themselves
God's
equal."
"Of
course
not,"
Bellamy
said,
his
tone
hardening.
"Because
most
Christians
want
it
both
ways.
They
want
to
be
able
to
proudly
declare
they
are
believers
in
the
Bible
and
yet
simply
ignore
those
parts
they
find
too
difficult
or
too
inconvenient
to
believe."
Langdon
made
no
response.
"Anyhow,"
Bellamy
said,
"the
Masonic
Pyramid's
age-old
description
as
being
tall
enough
to
be
touched
by
God
this
has
long
led
to
misinterpretations
about
its
size.
Conveniently,
it
keeps
academics
like
yourself
insisting
the
pyramid
is
a
legend,
and
nobody
searches
for
it."
Langdon
looked
down
at
the
stone
pyramid.
"I
apologize
that
I'm
frustrating
you,"
he
said.
"I've
simply
always
thought
of
the
Masonic
Pyramid
as
a
myth."
"Does
it
not
seem
perfectly
fitting
to
you
that
a
map
created
by
stonemasons
would
be
carved
in
stone?
Throughout
history,
our
most
important
guideposts
have
always
been
carved
in
stone
including
the
tablets
God
gave
Moses
Ten
Commandments
to
guide
our
human
conduct."
"I
understand,
and
yet
it
is
always
referred
to
as
the
Legend
of
the
Masonic
Pyramid.
Legend
implies
it
is
mythical."
"Yes,
legend."
Bellamy
chuckled.
"I'm
afraid
you're
suffering
from
the
same
problem
Moses
had."
"I'm
sorry?"
Bellamy
looked
almost
amused
as
he
turned
in
his
seat,
glancing
up
at
the
second-tier
balcony,
where
sixteen
bronze
statues
peered
down
at
them.
"Do
you
see
Moses?"
Langdon
gazed
up
at
the
library's
celebrated
statue
of
Moses.
"Yes."
"He
has
horns."
"I'm
aware
of
that."
"But
do
you
know
why
he
has
horns?"
Like
most
teachers,
Langdon
did
not
enjoy
being
lectured
to.
The
Moses
above
them
had
horns
for
the
same
reason
thousands
of
Christian
images
of
Moses
had
horns
a
mistranslation
of
the
book
of
Exodus.
The
original
Hebrew
text
described
Moses
as
having
"karan
'ohr
panav"
"facial
skin
that
glowed
with
rays
of
light"
but
when
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
created
the
official
Latin
translation
of
the
Bible,
the
translator
bungled
Moses's
description,
rendering
it
as
"cornuta
esset
fades
sua,meaning
"his
face
was
horned."
From
that
moment
on,
artists
and
sculptors,
fearing
reprisals
if
they
were
not
true
to
the
Gospels,
began
depicting
Moses
with
horns.
"It
was
a
simple
mistake,"
Langdon
replied.
"A
mistranslation
by
Saint
Jerome
around
four
hundred
A.D."
Bellamy
looked
impressed.
"Exactly.
A
mistranslation.
And
the
result
is
poor
Moses
is
now
misshapen
for
all
history."
"Misshapen"
was
a
nice
way
to
put
it.
Langdon,
as
a
child,
had
been
terrified
when
he
saw
Michelangelo's
diabolical
"horned
Moses"
the
centerpiece
of
Rome's
Basilica
of
St.
Peter
in
Chains.
"I
mention
the
horned
Moses,"
Bellamy
now
said,
"to
illustrate
how
a
single
word,
misunderstood,
can
rewrite
history."
You
're
preaching
to
the
choir,
Langdon
thought,
having
learned
the
lesson
firsthand
in
Paris
a
number
of
years
back.
SanGreal:
Holy
Grail.
SangReal:
Royal
Blood.
"In
the
case
of
the
Masonic
Pyramid,"
Bellamy
continued,
"people
heard
whispers
about
a
'legend.'
And
the
idea
stuck.
The
Legend
of
the
Masonic
Pyramid
sounded
like
a
myth.
But
the
word
legend
was
referring
to
something
else.
It
had
been
misconstrued.
Much
like
the
word
talisman."
He
smiled.
"Language
can
be
very
adept
at
hiding
the
truth."
"That's
true,
but
you're
losing
me
here."
"Robert,
the
Masonic
Pyramid
is
a
map.
And
like
every
map,
it
has
a
legend
a
key
that
tells
you
how
to
read
it."
Bellamy
took
the
cube-shaped
package
and
held
it
up.
"Don't
you
see?
This
capstone
is
the
legend
to
the
pyramid.
It
is
the
key
that
tells
you
how
to
read
the
most
powerful
artifact
on
earth
a
map
that
unveils
the
hiding
place
of
mankind's
greatest
treasure
the
lost
wisdom
of
the
ages."
Langdon
fell
silent.
"I
humbly
submit,"
Bellamy
said,
"that
your
towering
Masonic
Pyramid
is
only
this
a
modest
stone
whose
golden
capstone
reaches
high
enough
to
be
touched
by
God.
High
enough
that
an
enlightened
man
can
reach
down
and
touch
it."
Silence
hung
between
the
two
men
for
several
seconds.
Langdon
felt
an
unexpected
pulse
of
excitement
as
he
looked
down
at
the
pyramid,
seeing
it
in
a
new
light.
His
eyes
moved
again
to
the
Masonic
cipher.
"But
this
code
it
seems
so"
"Simple?"
Langdon
nodded.
"Almost
anyone
could
decipher
this."
Bellamy
smiled
and
retrieved
a
pencil
and
paper
for
Langdon.
"Then
perhaps
you
should
enlighten
us?"
Langdon
felt
uneasy
about
reading
the
code,
and
yet
considering
the
circumstances,
it
seemed
a
minor
betrayal
of
Peter's
trust.
Moreover,
whatever
the
engraving
said,
he
could
not
imagine
that
it
unveiled
a
secret
hiding
place
of
anything
at
all
much
less
that
of
one
of
history's
greatest
treasures.
Langdon
accepted
the
pencil
from
Bellamy
and
tapped
it
on
his
chin
as
he
studied
the
cipher.
The
code
was
so
simple
that
he
barely
needed
pencil
and
paper.
Even
so,
he
wanted
to
ensure
he
made
no
mistakes,
and
so
he
dutifully
put
pencil
to
paper
and
wrote
down
the
most
common
decryption
key
for
a
Masonic
cipher.
The
key
consisted
of
four
grids
two
plain
and
two
dotted
with
the
alphabet
running
through
them
in
order.
Each
letter
of
the
alphabet
was
now
positioned
inside
a
uniquely
shaped
"enclosure"
or
"pen."
The
shape
of
each
letter'
s
enclosure
became
the
symbol
for
that
letter.
The
scheme
was
so
simple,
it
was
almost
infantile.

Langdon
double-checked
his
handiwork.
Feeling
confident
the
decryption
key
was
correct,
he
now
turned
his
attention
back
to
the
code
inscribed
on
the
pyramid.
To
decipher
it,
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
find
the
matching
shape
on
his
decryption
key
and
write
down
the
letter
inside
it.
vED&lt;
Lvjv
The
first
character
on
the
pyramid
looked
like
a
down
arrow
or
a
chalice.
Langdon
quickly
found
the
chalice-
shaped
segment
on
the
decryption
key.
It
was
located
in
the
lower
left-hand
corner
and
enclosed
the
letter
S.
Langdon
wrote
down
S.
The
next
symbol
on
the
pyramid
was
a
dotted
square
missing
its
right
side.
That
shape
on
the
decryption
grid
enclosed
the
letter
O.
He
wrote
down
O.
The
third
symbol
was
a
simple
square,
which
enclosed
the
letter
E.
Langdon
wrote
down
E.
SOE..
.
He
continued,
picking
up
speed
until
he
had
completed
the
entire
grid.
Now,
as
he
gazed
down
at
his
finished
translation,
Langdon
let
out
a
puzzled
sigh.
Hardly
what
I'd
call
a
eureka
moment.
Bellamy's
face
showed
the
hint
of
a
smile.
"As
you
know,
Professor,
the
Ancient
Mysteries
are
reserved
only
for
the
truly
enlightened."
"Right,"
Langdon
said,
frowning.
Apparently,
I
don't
qualify.
In
a
basement
office
deep
inside
CIA
headquarters
in
Langley,
Virginia,
the
same
sixteen-character
Masonic
cipher
glowed
brightly
on
a
high-definition
computer
monitor.
Senior
OS
analyst
Nola
Kaye
sat
alone
and
studied
the
image
that
had
been
e-mailed
to
her
ten
minutes
ago
by
her
boss,
Director
Inoue
Sato.
Is
this
some
kind
of
joke?
Nola
knew
it
was
not,
of
course;
Director
Sato
had
no
sense
of
humor,
and
the
events
of
tonight
were
anything
but
a
joking
matter.
Nola's
high-level
clearance
within
the
CIA's
all-seeing
Office
of
Security
had
opened
her
eyes
to
the
shadow
worlds
of
power.
But
what
Nola
had
witnessed
in
the
last
twenty-four
hours
had
changed
her
impressions
forever
of
the
secrets
that
powerful
men
kept.
"Yes,
Director,"
Nola
now
said,
cradling
the
phone
on
her
shoulder
as
she
talked
to
Sato.
"The
engraving
is
indeed
the
Masonic
cipher.
However,
the
cleartext
is
meaningless.
It
appears
to
be
a
grid
of
random
letters."
She
gazed
down
at
her
decryption.

"It
must
say
something,"
Sato
insisted.
"Not
unless
it
has
a
second
layer
of
encryption
that
I'm
not
aware
of."
"Any
guesses?"
Sato
asked.
"It's
a
grid-based
matrix,
so
I
could
run
the
usual
Vigenere,
grilles,
trellises,
and
so
forth
but
no
promises,
especially
if
it's
a
onetime
pad."
"Do
what
you
can.
And
do
it
fast.
How
about
the
X-ray?"
Nola
swiveled
her
chair
to
a
second
system,
which
displayed
a
standard
security
X-ray
of
someone's
bag.
Sato
had
requested
information
on
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
pyramid
inside
a
cube-shaped
box.
Normally,
a
two-inch-tall
object
would
not
be
an
issue
of
national
security
unless
it
was
made
of
enriched
plutonium.
This
one
was
not.
It
was
made
of
something
almost
equally
startling.
"Image-density
analysis
was
conclusive,"
Nola
said.
"Nineteen-point-three
grams
per
cubic
centimeter.
It's
pure
gold.
Very,
very
valuable."
"Anything
else?"
"Actually,
yes.
The
density
scan
picked
up
minor
irregularities
on
the
surface
of
the
gold
pyramid.
It
turns
out
the
gold
is
engraved
with
text."
"Really?"
Sato
sounded
hopeful.
"What
does
it
say?"
"I
can't
tell
yet.
The
inscription
is
extremely
faint.
I'm
trying
to
enhance
with
filters,
but
the
resolution
on
the
X-ray
is
not
great."
"Okay,
keep
trying.
Call
me
when
you
have
something."
"Yes,
ma'am."
"And,
Nola?"
Sato's
tone
turned
ominous.
"As
with
everything
you
have
learned
in
the
last
twenty-four
hours,
the
images
of
the
stone
pyramid
and
gold
capstone
are
classified
at
the
highest
levels
of
security.
You
are
to
consult
no
one.
You
report
to
me
directly.
I
want
to
make
sure
that
is
clear."
"Of
course,
ma'am."
"Good.
Keep
me
posted."
Sato
hung
up.
Nola
rubbed
her
eyes
and
looked
blearily
back
at
her
computer
screens.
She
had
not
slept
in
over
thirty-six
hours,
and
she
knew
damn
well
she
would
not
sleep
again
until
this
crisis
had
reached
its
conclusion.
Whatever
that
may
be.
Back
at
the
Capitol
Visitor
Center,
four
black-clad
CIA
field-op
specialists
stood
at
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel,
peering
hungrily
down
the
dimly
lit
shaft
like
a
pack
of
dogs
eager
for
the
hunt.
Sato
approached,
having
just
hung
up
from
a
call.
"Gentlemen,"
she
said,
still
holding
the
Architect's
key,
"are
your
mission
parameters
clear?"
"Affirmative,"
the
lead
agent
replied.
"We
have
two
targets.
The
first
is
an
engraved
stone
pyramid,
approximately
one
foot
tall.
The
second
is
a
smaller,
cube-shaped
package,
approximately
two
inches
tall.
Both
were
last
seen
in
Robert
Langdon's
shoulder
bag."
"Correct,"
Sato
said.
"These
two
items
must
be
retrieved
quickly
and
intact.
Do
you
have
any
questions?"
"Parameters
for
use
of
force?"
Sato's
shoulder
was
still
throbbing
from
where
Bellamy
had
struck
her
with
a
bone.
"As
I
said,
it
is
of
critical
importance
that
these
items
be
retrieved."
"Understood."
The
four
men
turned
and
headed
into
the
darkness
of
the
tunnel.
Sato
lit
a
cigarette
and
watched
them
disappear.
Katherine
Solomon
had
always
been
a
prudent
driver,
but
now
she
was
pushing
her
Volvo
at
over
ninety
as
she
fled
blindly
up
the
Suitland
Parkway.
Her
trembling
foot
had
been
lodged
on
the
accelerator
for
a
full
mile
before
her
panic
began
to
lift.
She
now
realized
her
uncontrollable
shivering
was
no
longer
solely
from
fear.
I'm
freezing.
The
wintry
night
air
was
gushing
through
her
shattered
window,
buffeting
her
body
like
an
arctic
wind.
Her
stockinged
feet
were
numb,
and
she
reached
down
for
her
spare
pair
of
shoes,
which
she
kept
beneath
the
passenger
seat.
As
she
did,
she
felt
a
stab
of
pain
from
the
bruise
on
her
throat,
where
the
powerful
hand
had
latched
on
to
her
neck.
The
man
who
had
smashed
through
her
window
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
blond-haired
gentleman
whom
Katherine
knew
as
Dr.
Christopher
Abaddon.
His
thick
hair
and
smooth,
tanned
complexion
had
disappeared.
His
shaved
head,
bare
chest,
and
makeup-smeared
face
had
been
unveiled
as
a
terrifying
tapestry
of
tattoos.
She
heard
his
voice
again,
whispering
to
her
in
the
howl
of
wind
outside
her
broken
window.
Katherine,
I
should
have
killed
you
years
ago
the
night
I
killed
your
mother.
Katherine
shivered,
feeling
no
doubt.
That
was
him.
She
had
never
forgotten
the
look
of
fiendish
violence
in
his
eyes.
Nor
had
she
ever
forgotten
the
sound
of
her
brother's
single
gunshot,
which
had
killed
this
man,
propelling
him
off
a
high
ledge
into
the
frozen
river
below,
where
he
plummeted
through
the
ice
and
never
resurfaced.
Investigators
had
searched
for
weeks,
never
finding
his
body,
and
finally
decided
it
had
been
washed
away
by
the
current
out
to
the
Chesapeake
Bay.
They
were
wrong,
she
now
knew.
He
is
still
alive.
And
he
's
back.
Katherine
felt
angst-ridden
as
the
memories
flooded
back.
It
was
almost
exactly
ten
years
ago.
Christmas
Day.
Katherine,
Peter,
and
their
mother
her
entire
family
were
gathered
at
their
sprawling
stone
mansion
in
Potomac,
nestled
on
a
two-hundred-acre
wooded
estate
with
its
own
river
running
through
it.
As
was
tradition,
their
mother
worked
diligently
in
the
kitchen,
rejoicing
in
the
holiday
custom
of
cooking
for
her
two
children.
Even
at
seventy-five
years
of
age,
Isabel
Solomon
was
an
exuberant
cook,
and
tonight
the
mouthwatering
smells
of
roast
venison,
parsnip
gravy,
and
garlic
mashed
potatoes
wafted
through
the
house.
While
Mother
prepared
the
feast,
Katherine
and
her
brother
relaxed
in
the
conservatory,
discussing
Katherine'
s
latest
fascination
a
new
field
called
Noetic
Science.
An
unlikely
fusion
of
modern
particle
physics
and
ancient
mysticism,
Noetics
had
absolutely
captivated
Katherine'
s
imagination.
Physics
meets
philosophy.
Katherine
told
Peter
about
some
of
the
experiments
she
was
dreaming
up,
and
she
could
see
in
his
eyes
that
he
was
intrigued.
Katherine
felt
particularly
pleased
to
give
her
brother
something
positive
to
think
about
this
Christmas,
since
the
holiday
had
also
become
a
painful
reminder
of
a
terrible
tragedy.
Peter's
son,
Zachary.
Katherine'
s
nephew's
twenty-first
birthday
had
been
his
last.
The
family
had
been
through
a
nightmare,
and
it
seemed
that
her
brother
was
only
now
finally
learning
how
to
laugh
again.
Zachary
had
been
a
late
bloomer,
frail
and
awkward,
a
rebellious
and
angry
teenager.
Despite
his
deeply
loving
and
privileged
upbringing,
the
boy
seemed
determined
to
detach
himself
from
the
Solomon
"establishment."
He
was
kicked
out
of
prep
school,
partied
hard
with
the
"celebrati,"
and
shunned
his
parents'
exhaustive
attempts
to
provide
him
firm
and
loving
guidance.
He
broke
Peter's
heart.
Shortly
before
Zachary'
s
eighteenth
birthday,
Katherine
had
sat
down
with
her
mother
and
brother
and
listened
to
them
debating
whether
or
not
to
withhold
Zachary
's
inheritance
until
he
was
more
mature.
The
Solomon
inheritance
a
centuries-old
tradition
in
the
family
bequeathed
a
staggeringly
generous
piece
of
the
Solomon
wealth
to
every
Solomon
child
on
his
or
her
eighteenth
birthday.
The
Solomons
believed
that
an
inheritance
was
more
helpful
at
the
beginning
of
someone's
life
than
at
the
end.
Moreover,
placing
large
pieces
of
the
Solomon
fortune
in
the
hands
of
eager
young
descendants
had
been
the
key
to
growing
the
family's
dynastic
wealth.
In
this
case,
however,
Katherine'
s
mother
argued
that
it
was
dangerous
to
give
Peter's
troubled
son
such
a
large
sum
of
money.
Peter
disagreed.
"The
Solomon
inheritance,"
her
brother
had
said,
"is
a
family
tradition
that
should
not
be
broken.
This
money
may
well
force
Zachary
to
be
more
responsible."
Sadly,
her
brother
had
been
wrong.
The
moment
Zachary
received
the
money,
he
broke
from
the
family,
disappearing
from
the
house
without
taking
any
of
his
belongings.
He
surfaced
a
few
months
later
in
the
tabloids:
TRUST
FUND
PLAYBOY
LIVING
EUROPEAN
HIGH
LIFE.
The
tabloids
took
joy
in
documenting
Zachary'
s
spoiled
life
of
debauchery.
The
photos
of
wild
parties
on
yachts
and
drunken
disco
stupors
were
hard
for
the
Solomons
to
take,
but
the
photos
of
their
wayward
teen
turned
from
tragic
to
frightening
when
the
papers
reported
Zachary
had
been
caught
carrying
cocaine
across
a
border
in
Eastern
Europe:
SOLOMON
MILLIONAIRE
IN
TURKISH
PRISON.
The
prison,
they
learned,
was
called
Soganlik
a
brutal
F-class
detention
center
located
in
the
Kartal
district
outside
of
Istanbul.
Peter
Solomon,
fearing
for
his
son's
safety,
flew
to
Turkey
to
retrieve
him.
Katherine's
distraught
brother
returned
empty-handed,
having
been
forbidden
even
to
visit
with
Zachary.
The
only
promising
news
was
that
Solomon's
influential
contacts
at
the
U.S.
State
Department
were
working
on
getting
him
extradited
as
quickly
as
possible.
Two
days
later,
however,
Peter
received
a
horrifying
international
phone
call.
The
next
morning,
headlines
blared:
SOLOMON
HEIR
MURDERED
IN
PRISON.
The
prison
photos
were
horrific,
and
the
media
callously
aired
them
all,
even
long
after
the
Solomons'
private
burial
ceremony.
Peter's
wife
never
forgave
him
for
failing
to
free
Zachary,
and
their
marriage
came
to
an
end
six
months
later.
Peter
had
been
alone
ever
since.
It
was
years
later
that
Katherine,
Peter,
and
their
mother,
Isabel,
were
gathered
quietly
for
Christmas.
The
pain
was
still
a
presence
in
their
family,
but
mercifully
it
was
fading
with
each
passing
year.
The
pleasant
rattle
of
pots
and
pans
now
echoed
from
the
kitchen
as
their
mother
prepared
the
traditional
feast.
Out
in
the
conservatory,
Peter
and
Katherine
were
enjoying
a
baked
Brie
and
relaxed
holiday
conversation.
Then
came
an
utterly
unexpected
sound.
"Hello,
Solomons,"
an
airy
voice
said
behind
them.
Startled,
Katherine
and
her
brother
spun
to
see
an
enormous
muscular
figure
stepping
into
the
conservatory.
He
wore
a
black
ski
mask
that
covered
all
of
his
face
except
his
eyes,
which
shone
with
feral
ferocity.
Peter
was
on
his
feet
in
an
instant.
"Who
are
you?!
How
did
you
get
in
here?!"
"I
knew
your
little
boy,
Zachary,
in
prison.
He
told
me
where
this
key
was
hidden."
The
stranger
held
up
an
old
key
and
grinned
like
a
beast.
"Right
before
I
bludgeoned
him
to
death."
Peter's
mouth
fell
open.
A
pistol
appeared,
aimed
directly
at
Peter's
chest.
"Sit."
Peter
fell
back
into
his
chair.
As
the
man
moved
into
the
room,
Katherine
was
frozen
in
place.
Behind
his
mask,
the
man's
eyes
were
wild
like
those
of
a
rabid
animal.
"Hey!"
Peter
yelled,
as
if
trying
to
warn
their
mother
in
the
kitchen.
"Whoever
you
are,
take
what
you
want,
and
get
out!"
The
man
leveled
his
gun
at
Peter's
chest.
"And
what
is
it
you
think
I
want?"
"Just
tell
me
how
much,"
Solomon
said.
"We
don't
have
money
in
the
house,
but
I
can
The
monster
laughed.
"Do
not
insult
me.
I
have
not
come
for
money.
I
have
come
tonight
for
Zachary'
s
other
birthright."
He
grinned.
"He
told
me
about
the
pyramid."
Pyramid?
Katherine
thought
in
bewildered
terror.
What
pyramid?
Her
brother
was
defiant.
"I
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about."
"Don't
play
dumb
with
me!
Zachary
told
me
what
you
keep
in
your
study
vault.
I
want
it.
Now."
"Whatever
Zachary
told
you,
he
was
confused,"
Peter
said.
"I
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about!"
"No?"
The
intruder
turned
and
aimed
the
gun
at
Katherine'
s
face.
"How
about
now?"
Peter's
eyes
filled
with
terror.
"You
must
believe
me!
I
don't
know
what
it
is
you
want!"
"Lie
to
me
one
more
time,"
he
said,
still
aiming
at
Katherine,
"and
I
swear
I
will
take
her
from
you."
He
smiled.
"And
from
what
Zachary
said,
your
little
sister
is
more
precious
to
you
than
all
your
"What's
going
on?!"
Katherine'
s
mother
shouted,
marching
into
the
room
with
Peter's
Browning
Citori
shotgun
which
she
aimed
directly
at
the
man's
chest.
The
intruder
spun
toward
her,
and
the
feisty
seventy-
five-year-old
woman
wasted
no
time.
She
fired
a
deafening
blast
of
pellets.
The
intruder
staggered
backward,
firing
his
handgun
wildly
in
all
directions,
shattering
windows
as
he
fell
and
crashed
through
the
glass
doorway,
dropping
the
pistol
as
he
fell.
Peter
was
instantly
in
motion,
diving
on
the
loose
handgun.
Katherine
had
fallen,
and
Mrs.
Solomon
hurried
to
her
side,
kneeling
beside
her.
"My
God,
are
you
hurt?!"
Katherine
shook
her
head,
mute
with
shock.
Outside
the
shattered
glass
door,
the
masked
man
had
clambered
to
his
feet
and
was
running
into
the
woods,
clutching
his
side
as
he
ran.
Peter
Solomon
glanced
back
to
make
sure
his
mother
and
sister
were
safe,
and
seeing
they
were
fine,
he
held
the
pistol
and
raced
out
the
door
after
the
intruder.
Katherine's
mother
held
her
hand,
trembling.
"Thank
heavens
you're
okay."
Then
suddenly
her
mother
pulled
away.
"Katherine?
You're
bleeding!
There's
blood!
You're
hurt!"
Katherine
saw
the
blood.
A
lot
of
blood.
It
was
all
over
her.
But
she
felt
no
pain.
Her
mother
frantically
searched
Katherine's
body
for
a
wound.
"Where
does
it
hurt!"
"Mom,
I
don't
know,
I
don't
feel
anything!"
Then
Katherine
saw
the
source
of
the
blood,
and
she
went
cold.
"Mom,
it's
not
me"
She
pointed
to
the
side
of
her
mother's
white
satin
blouse,
where
blood
was
running
freely,
and
a
small
tattered
hole
was
visible.
Her
mother
glanced
down,
looking
more
confused
than
anything
else.
She
winced
and
shrank
back,
as
if
the
pain
had
just
hit
her.
"Katherine?"
Her
voice
was
calm,
but
suddenly
it
carried
the
weight
of
her
seventy-five
years.
"I
need
you
to
call
an
ambulance."
Katherine
ran
to
the
hall
phone
and
called
for
help.
When
she
got
back
to
the
conservatory,
she
found
her
mother
lying
motionless
in
a
pool
of
blood.
She
ran
to
her,
crouching
down,
cradling
her
mother's
body
in
her
arms.
Katherine
had
no
idea
how
much
time
had
passed
when
she
heard
the
distant
gunshot
in
the
woods.
Finally,
the
conservatory
door
burst
open,
and
her
brother,
Peter,
rushed
in,
eyes
wild,
gun
still
in
his
hand.
When
he
saw
Katherine
sobbing,
holding
their
lifeless
mother
in
her
arms,
his
face
contorted
in
anguish.
The
scream
that
echoed
through
the
conservatory
was
a
sound
Katherine
Solomon
would
never
forget.
Mal'akh
could
feel
the
tattooed
muscles
on
his
back
rippling
as
he
sprinted
back
around
the
building
toward
the
open
bay
door
of
Pod
5.
/
must
gain
access
to
her
lab.
Katherine's
escape
had
been
unanticipated
and
problematic.
Not
only
did
she
know
where
Mal'akh
lived,
she
now
knew
his
true
identity
and
that
he
was
the
one
who
had
invaded
their
home
a
decade
earlier.
Mal'akh
had
not
forgotten
that
night
either.
He
had
come
within
inches
of
possessing
the
pyramid,
but
destiny
had
obstructed
him.
/
was
not
yet
ready.
But
he
was
ready
now.
More
powerful.
More
influential.
Having
endured
unthinkable
hardship
in
preparation
for
his
return,
Mal'akh
was
poised
tonight
to
fulfill
his
destiny
at
last.
He
felt
certain
that
before
the
night
was
over,
he
would
indeed
be
staring
into
the
dying
eyes
of
Katherine
Solomon.
As
Mal'akh
reached
the
bay
door,
he
reassured
himself
that
Katherine
had
not
truly
escaped;
she
had
only
prolonged
the
inevitable.
He
slid
through
the
opening
and
strode
confidently
across
the
darkness
until
his
feet
hit
the
carpet.
Then
he
took
a
right
turn
and
headed
for
the
Cube.
The
banging
on
the
door
of
Pod
5
had
stopped,
and
Mal'akh
suspected
the
guard
was
now
trying
to
remove
the
dime
Mal'akh
had
jammed
into
the
key
panel
to
render
it
useless.
When
Mal'akh
reached
the
door
that
led
into
the
Cube,
he
located
the
outer
keypad
and
inserted
Trish's
key
card.
The
panel
lit
up.
He
entered
Trish's
PIN
and
went
inside.
The
lights
were
all
ablaze,
and
as
he
moved
into
the
sterile
space,
he
squinted
in
amazement
at
the
dazzling
array
of
equipment.
Mal'akh
was
no
stranger
to
the
power
of
technology;
he
performed
his
own
breed
of
science
in
the
basement
of
his
home,
and
last
night
some
of
that
science
had
borne
fruit.
The
Truth.
Peter
Solomon's
unique
confinement
trapped
alone
in
the
in-between
had
laid
bare
all
of
the
man's
secrets.
/
can
see
his
soul.
Mal'akh
had
learned
certain
secrets
he
anticipated,
and
others
he
had
not,
including
the
news
about
Katherine's
lab
and
her
shocking
discoveries.
Science
is
getting
close,
Mal'akh
had
realized.
And
I
will
not
allow
it
to
light
the
way
for
the
unworthy.
Katherine's
work
here
had
begun
using
modern
science
to
answer
ancient
philosophical
questions.
Does
anyone
hear
our
prayers?
Is
there
life
after
death?
Do
humans
have
souls?
Incredibly,
Katherine
had
answered
all
of
these
questions,
and
more.
Scientifically.
Conclusively.
The
methods
she
used
were
irrefutable.
Even
the
most
skeptical
of
people
would
be
persuaded
by
the
results
of
her
experiments.
If
this
information
were
published
and
made
known,
a
fundamental
shift
would
begin
in
the
consciousness
of
man.
They
will
start
to
find
their
way.
Mal'akh's
last
task
tonight,
before
his
transformation,
was
to
ensure
that
this
did
not
happen.
As
he
moved
through
the
lab,
Mal'akh
located
the
data
room
that
Peter
had
told
him
about.
He
peered
through
the
heavy
glass
walls
at
the
two
holographic
data-storage
units.
Exactly
as
he
said
they
would
be.
Mal'akh
found
it
hard
to
imagine
that
the
contents
of
these
little
boxes
could
change
the
course
of
human
development,
and
yet
Truth
had
always
been
the
most
potent
of
all
the
catalysts.
Eyeing
the
holographic
storage
units,
Mal'akh
produced
Trish's
key
card
and
inserted
it
in
the
door's
security
panel.
To
his
surprise,
the
panel
did
not
light
up.
Apparently,
access
to
this
room
was
not
a
trust
extended
to
Trish
Dunne.
He
now
reached
for
the
key
card
he
had
found
in
Katherine's
lab-coat
pocket.
When
he
inserted
this
one,
the
panel
lit
up.
Mal'akh
had
a
problem.
/
never
got
Katherine
's
PIN.
He
tried
Trish's
PIN,
but
it
didn't
work.
Stroking
his
chin,
he
stepped
back
and
examined
the
three-inch-thick
Plexiglas
door.
Even
with
an
ax,
he
knew
he
would
be
unable
to
break
through
and
obtain
the
drives
he
needed
to
destroy.
Mal'akh
had
planned
for
this
contingency,
however.
Inside
the
power-supply
room,
exactly
as
Peter
had
described,
Mal'akh
located
the
rack
holding
several
metal
cylinders
resembling
large
scuba
tanks.
The
cylinders
bore
the
letters
LH,
the
number
2,
and
the
universal
symbol
for
combustible.
One
of
the
canisters
was
connected
to
the
lab's
hydrogen
fuel
cell.
Mal'akh
left
one
canister
connected
and
carefully
heaved
one
of
the
reserve
cylinders
down
onto
a
dolly
beside
the
rack.
Then
he
rolled
the
cylinder
out
of
the
power-supply
room,
across
the
lab,
to
the
Plexiglas
door
of
the
data-storage
room.
Although
this
location
would
certainly
be
plenty
close
enough,
he
had
noticed
one
weakness
in
the
heavy
Plexiglas
door
the
small
space
between
the
bottom
and
the
jamb.
At
the
threshold,
he
carefully
laid
the
canister
on
its
side
and
slid
the
flexible
rubber
tube
beneath
the
door.
It
took
him
a
moment
to
remove
the
safety
seals
and
access
the
cylinder's
valve,
but
once
he
did,
ever
so
gently,
he
uncocked
the
valve.
Through
the
Plexiglas,
he
could
see
the
clear,
bubbling
liquid
begin
draining
out
of
the
tube
onto
the
floor
inside
the
storage
room.
Mal'akh
watched
the
puddle
expand,
oozing
across
the
floor,
steaming
and
bubbling
as
it
grew.
Hydrogen
remained
in
liquid
form
only
when
it
was
cold,
and
as
it
warmed
up,
it
would
start
to
boil
off.
The
resulting
gas,
conveniently,
was
even
more
flammable
than
the
liquid.
Remember
the
Hindenburg.
Mal'akh
hurried
now
into
the
lab
and
retrieved
the
Pyrex
jug
of
Bunsen-burner
fuel
a
viscous,
highly
flammable,
yet
noncombustible
oil.
He
carried
it
to
the
Plexiglas
door,
pleased
to
see
the
liquid
hydrogen
canister
was
still
draining,
the
puddle
of
boiling
liquid
inside
the
data-storage
room
now
covering
the
entire
floor,
encircling
the
pedestals
that
supported
the
holographic
storage
units.
A
whitish
mist
now
rose
from
the
boiling
puddle
as
the
liquid
hydrogen
began
turning
to
gas
filling
the
small
space.
Mal'akh
raised
the
jug
of
Bunsen-burner
fuel
and
squirted
a
healthy
amount
on
the
hydrogen
canister,
the
tubing,
and
into
the
small
opening
beneath
the
door.
Then,
very
carefully,
he
began
backing
out
of
the
lab,
leaving
an
unbroken
stream
of
oil
on
the
floor
as
he
went.
The
dispatch
operator
handling
911
calls
for
Washington,
D.C.,
had
been
unusually
busy
tonight.
Football,
beer,
and
a
full
moon,
she
thought
as
yet
another
emergency
call
appeared
on
her
screen,
this
one
from
a
gas-
station
pay
phone
on
the
Suitland
Parkway
in
Anacostia.
A
car
accident
probably.
"Nine-one-one,"
she
answered.
"What
is
your
emergency?"
"I
was
just
attacked
at
the
Smithsonian
Museum
Support
Center,"
a
panicked
woman's
voice
said.
"Please
send
the
police!
Forty-two-ten
Silver
Hill
Road!"
"Okay,
slow
down,"
the
operator
said.
"You
need
to
"I
need
you
to
send
officers
also
to
a
mansion
in
Kalorama
Heights
where
I
think
my
brother
may
be
held
captive!"
The
operator
sighed.
Full
moon.
As
I
tried
to
tell
you,"
Bellamy
was
saying
to
Langdon,
"there
is
more
to
this
pyramid
than
meets
the
eye."
Apparently
so.
Langdon
had
to
admit
that
the
stone
pyramid
sitting
in
his
unzipped
daybag
looked
much
more
mysterious
to
him
now.
His
decryption
of
the
Masonic
cipher
had
rendered
a
seemingly
meaningless
grid
of
letters.
Chaos.
S
o
E
A
T
N
c:
s
A
S
\
\
I
For
a
long
while,
Langdon
examined
the
grid,
searching
for
any
hint
of
meaning
within
the
letters
hidden
words,
anagrams,
clues
of
any
sort
but
he
found
nothing.
"The
Masonic
Pyramid,"
Bellamy
explained,
"is
said
to
guard
its
secrets
behind
many
veils.
Each
time
you
pull
back
a
curtain,
you
face
another.
You
have
unveiled
these
letters,
and
yet
they
tell
you
nothing
until
you
peel
back
another
layer.
Of
course,
the
way
to
do
that
is
known
only
to
the
one
who
holds
the
capstone.
The
capstone,
I
suspect,
has
an
inscription
as
well,
which
tells
you
how
to
decipher
the
pyramid."
Langdon
glanced
at
the
cube-shaped
package
on
the
desk.
From
what
Bellamy
had
said,
Langdon
now
understood
that
the
capstone
and
pyramid
were
a
"segmented
cipher"
a
code
broken
into
pieces.
Modern
cryptologists
used
segmented
ciphers
all
the
time,
although
the
security
scheme
had
been
invented
in
ancient
Greece.
The
Greeks,
when
they
wanted
to
store
secret
information,
inscribed
it
on
a
clay
tablet
and
then
shattered
the
tablet
into
pieces,
storing
each
piece
in
a
separate
location.
Only
when
all
the
pieces
were
gathered
together
could
the
secrets
be
read.
This
kind
of
inscribed
clay
tablet
called
a
symbolon
was
in
fact
the
origin
of
the
modern
word
symbol.
"Robert,"
Bellamy
said,
"this
pyramid
and
capstone
have
been
kept
apart
for
generations,
ensuring
the
secret's
safety."
His
tone
turned
rueful.
"Tonight,
however,
the
pieces
have
come
dangerously
close.
I'm
sure
I
don't
have
to
say
this
but
it
is
our
duty
to
ensure
this
pyramid
is
not
assembled."
Langdon
found
Bellamy's
sense
of
drama
to
be
somewhat
overwrought.
Is
he
describing
the
capstone
and
pyramid
or
a
detonator
and
nuclear
bomb?
He
still
couldn't
quite
accept
Bellamy's
claims,
but
it
hardly
seemed
to
matter.
"Even
if
this
is
the
Masonic
Pyramid,
and
even
if
this
inscription
does
somehow
reveal
the
location
of
ancient
knowledge,
how
could
that
knowledge
possibly
impart
the
kind
of
power
it
is
said
to
impart?"
"Peter
always
told
me
you
were
a
hard
man
to
convince
an
academic
who
prefers
proof
to
speculation."
"You're
saying
you
do
believe
that?"
Langdon
demanded,
feeling
impatient
now.
"Respectfully
you
are
a
modern,
educated
man.
How
could
you
believe
such
a
thing?"
Bellamy
gave
a
patient
smile.
"The
craft
of
Freemasonry
has
given
me
a
deep
respect
for
that
which
transcends
human
understanding.
I've
learned
never
to
close
my
mind
to
an
idea
simply
because
it
seems
miraculous."
Frantically,
the
SMSC
perimeter
patrolman
dashed
down
the
gravel
pathway
that
ran
along
the
outside
of
the
building.
He'd
just
received
a
call
from
an
officer
inside
saying
that
the
keypad
to
Pod
5
had
been
sabotaged,
and
that
a
security
light
indicated
that
Pod
5's
specimen
bay
door
was
now
open.
What
the
hell
is
going
on
?!
As
he
arrived
at
the
specimen
bay,
sure
enough
he
found
the
door
open
a
couple
of
feet.
Bizarre,
he
thought.
This
can
only
be
unlocked
from
the
inside.
He
took
the
flashlight
off
his
belt
and
shone
it
into
the
inky
blackness
of
the
pod.
Nothing.
Having
no
desire
to
step
into
the
unknown,
he
moved
only
as
far
as
the
threshold
and
then
stuck
the
flashlight
through
the
opening,
swinging
it
to
the
left,
and
then
to
the
Powerful
hands
seized
his
wrist
and
yanked
him
into
the
blackness.
The
guard
felt
himself
being
spun
around
by
an
invisible
force.
He
smelled
ethanol.
The
flashlight
flew
out
of
his
hand,
and
before
he
could
even
process
what
was
happening,
a
rock-hard
fist
collided
with
his
sternum.
The
guard
crumpled
to
the
cement
floor
groaning
in
pain
as
a
large
black
form
stepped
away
from
him.
The
guard
lay
on
his
side,
gasping
and
wheezing
for
breath.
His
flashlight
lay
nearby,
its
beam
spilling
across
the
floor
and
illuminating
what
appeared
to
be
a
metal
can
of
some
sort.
The
can's
label
said
it
was
fuel
oil
for
a
Bunsen
burner.
A
cigarette
lighter
sparked,
and
the
orange
flame
illuminated
a
vision
that
hardly
seemed
human.
Jesus
Christ!
The
guard
barely
had
time
to
process
what
he
was
seeing
before
the
bare-chested
creature
knelt
down
and
touched
the
flame
to
the
floor.
Instantly,
a
strip
of
fire
materialized,
leaping
away
from
them,
racing
into
the
void.
Bewildered,
the
guard
looked
back,
but
the
creature
was
already
slipping
out
the
open
bay
door
into
the
night.
The
guard
managed
to
sit
up,
wincing
in
pain
as
his
eyes
followed
the
thin
ribbon
of
fire.
What
the
hell?!
The
flame
looked
too
small
to
be
truly
dangerous,
and
yet
now
he
saw
something
utterly
terrifying.
The
fire
was
no
longer
illuminating
only
the
darkened
void.
It
had
traveled
all
the
way
to
the
back
wall,
where
it
was
now
illuminating
a
massive
cinder-
block
structure.
The
guard
had
never
been
permitted
inside
Pod
5,
but
he
knew
very
well
what
this
structure
must
be.
The
Cube.
Katherine
Solomon
's
lab.
The
flame
raced
in
a
straight
line
directly
to
the
lab's
outer
door.
The
guard
clambered
to
his
feet,
knowing
full
well
that
the
ribbon
of
oil
probably
continued
beneath
the
lab
door
and
would
soon
start
a
fire
inside.
But
as
he
turned
to
run
for
help,
he
felt
an
unexpected
puff
of
air
sucking
past
him.
For
a
brief
instant,
all
of
Pod
5
was
bathed
in
light.
The
guard
never
saw
the
hydrogen
fireball
erupting
skyward,
ripping
the
roof
off
Pod
5
and
billowing
hundreds
of
feet
into
the
air.
Nor
did
he
see
the
sky
raining
fragments
of
titanium
mesh,
electronic
equipment,
and
droplets
of
melted
silicon
from
the
lab's
holographic
storage
units.
Katherine
Solomon
was
driving
north
when
she
saw
the
sudden
flash
of
light
in
her
rearview
mirror.
A
deep
rumble
thundered
through
the
night
air,
startling
her.
Fireworks?
she
wondered.
Do
the
Redskins
have
a
halftime
show?
She
refocused
on
the
road,
her
thoughts
still
on
the
91
1
call
she'd
placed
from
the
deserted
gas
station's
pay
phone.
Katherine
had
successfully
convinced
the
911
dispatcher
to
send
the
police
to
the
SMSC
to
investigate
a
tattooed
intruder
and,
Katherine
prayed,
to
find
her
assistant,
Trish.
In
addition,
she
urged
the
dispatcher
to
check
Dr.
Abaddon's
address
in
Kalorama
Heights,
where
she
thought
Peter
was
being
held
hostage.
Unfortunately,
Katherine
had
been
unable
to
obtain
Robert
Langdon's
unlisted
cell-phone
number.
So
now,
seeing
no
other
option,
she
was
speeding
toward
the
Library
of
Congress,
where
Langdon
had
told
her
he
was
headed.
The
terrifying
revelation
of
Dr.
Abaddon's
true
identity
had
changed
everything.
Katherine
had
no
idea
what
to
believe
anymore.
All
she
knew
for
certain
was
that
the
same
man
who
had
killed
her
mother
and
nephew
all
those
years
ago
had
now
captured
her
brother
and
had
come
to
kill
her.
Who
is
this
madman?
What
does
he
want?
The
only
answer
she
could
come
up
with
made
no
sense.
A
pyramid?
Equally
confusing
was
why
this
man
had
come
to
her
lab
tonight.
If
he
wanted
to
hurt
her,
why
hadn't
he
done
so
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home
earlier
today?
Why
go
to
the
trouble
of
sending
a
text
message
and
risk
breaking
into
her
lab?
Unexpectedly,
the
fireworks
in
her
rearview
mirror
grew
brighter,
the
initial
flash
followed
by
an
unexpected
sight
a
blazing
orange
fireball
that
Katherine
could
see
rising
above
the
tree
line.
What
in
the
world?!
The
fireball
was
accompanied
by
dark
black
smoke
and
it
was
nowhere
near
the
Redskins'
FedEx
Field.
Bewildered,
she
tried
to
determine
what
industry
might
be
located
on
the
other
side
of
those
trees
just
southeast
of
the
parkway.
Then,
like
an
oncoming
truck,
it
hit
her.
Warren
Bellamy
stabbed
urgently
at
the
buttons
on
his
cell
phone,
trying
again
to
make
contact
with
someone
who
could
help
them,
whoever
that
might
be.
Langdon
watched
Bellamy,
but
his
mind
was
with
Peter,
trying
to
figure
out
how
best
to
find
him.
Decipher
the
engraving,
Peter's
captor
had
commanded,
and
it
will
tell
you
the
hiding
place
of
mankind's
greatest
treasure
We
will
go
together
and
make
our
trade.
Bellamy
hung
up,
frowning.
Still
no
answer.
"Here's
what
I
don't
understand,"
Langdon
said.
"Even
if
I
could
somehow
accept
that
this
hidden
wisdom
exists
and
that
this
pyramid
somehow
points
to
its
underground
location
what
am
I
looking
for?
A
vault?
A
bunker?"
Bellamy
sat
quietly
for
a
long
moment.
Then
he
gave
a
reluctant
sigh
and
spoke
guardedly.
"Robert,
according
to
what
Eve
heard
through
the
years,
the
pyramid
leads
to
the
entrance
of
a
spiral
staircase."
"A
staircase!"
"That's
right.
A
staircase
that
leads
down
into
the
earth
many
hundreds
of
feet."
Langdon
could
not
believe
what
he
was
hearing.
He
leaned
closer.
"Eve
heard
it
said
that
the
ancient
wisdom
is
buried
at
the
bottom."
Robert
Langdon
stood
up
and
began
pacing.
A
spiral
staircase
descending
hundreds
of
feet
into
the
earth
in
Washington,
D.C.
"And
nobody
has
ever
seen
this
staircase?"
"Allegedly
the
entrance
has
been
covered
with
an
enormous
stone."
Langdon
sighed.
The
idea
of
a
tomb
covered
with
an
enormous
stone
was
right
out
of
the
biblical
accounts
of
Jesus'
tomb.
This
archetypal
hybrid
was
the
grandfather
of
them
all.
"Warren,
do
you
believe
this
secret
mystical
staircase
into
the
earth
exists?"
"Eve
never
seen
it
personally,
but
a
few
of
the
older
Masons
swear
it
exists.
I
was
trying
to
call
one
of
them
just
now."
Langdon
continued
pacing,
uncertain
what
to
say
next.
"Robert,
you
leave
me
a
difficult
task
with
respect
to
this
pyramid."
Warren
Bellamy's
gaze
hardened
in
the
soft
glow
of
the
reading
lamp.
"I
know
of
no
way
to
force
a
man
to
believe
what
he
does
not
want
to
believe.
And
yet
I
hope
you
understand
your
duty
to
Peter
Solomon."
Yes,
I
have
a
duty
to
help
him,
Langdon
thought.
"I
don't
need
you
to
believe
in
the
power
this
pyramid
can
unveil.
Nor
do
I
need
you
to
believe
in
the
staircase
it
supposedly
leads
to.
But
I
do
need
you
to
believe
that
you
are
morally
obliged
to
protect
this
secret
whatever
it
may
be."
Bellamy
motioned
to
the
little
cube-shaped
package.
"Peter
entrusted
the
capstone
to
you
because
he
had
faith
you
would
obey
his
wishes
and
keep
it
secret.
And
now
you
must
do
exactly
that,
even
if
it
means
sacrificing
Peter's
life."
Langdon
stopped
short
and
wheeled
around.
"What?!"
Bellamy
remained
seated,
his
expression
pained
but
resolute.
"It's
what
he
would
want.
You
need
to
forget
Peter.
He's
gone.
Peter
did
his
job,
doing
the
best
he
could
to
protect
the
pyramid.
Now
it
is
our
job
to
make
sure
his
efforts
were
not
in
vain."
"I
can't
believe
you're
saying
this!"
Langdon
exclaimed,
temper
flaring.
"Even
if
this
pyramid
is
everything
you
say
it
is,
Peter
is
your
Masonic
brother.
You're
sworn
to
protect
him
above
all
else,
even
your
country!"
"No,
Robert.
A
Mason
must
protect
a
fellow
Mason
above
all
things
except
one
the
great
secret
our
brotherhood
protects
for
all
mankind.
Whether
or
not
I
believe
this
lost
wisdom
has
the
potential
that
history
suggests,
I
have
taken
a
vow
to
keep
it
out
of
the
hands
of
the
unworthy.
And
I
would
not
give
it
over
to
anyone
even
in
exchange
for
Peter
Solomon's
life."
"I
know
plenty
of
Masons,"
Langdon
said
angrily,
"including
the
most
advanced,
and
I'm
damned
sure
these
men
are
not
sworn
to
sacrifice
their
lives
for
the
sake
of
a
stone
pyramid.
And
I'm
also
damned
sure
none
of
them
believes
in
a
secret
staircase
that
descends
to
a
treasure
buried
deep
in
the
earth."
"There
are
circles
within
circles,
Robert.
Not
everyone
knows
everything."
Langdon
exhaled,
trying
to
control
his
emotions.
He,
like
everyone,
had
heard
the
rumors
of
elite
circles
within
the
Masons.
Whether
or
not
it
was
true
seemed
irrelevant
in
the
face
of
this
situation.
"Warren,
if
this
pyramid
and
capstone
truly
reveal
the
ultimate
Masonic
secret,
then
why
would
Peter
involve
mel
I'm
not
even
a
brother
much
less
part
of
any
inner
circle."
"I
know,
and
I
suspect
that
is
precisely
why
Peter
chose
you
to
guard
it.
This
pyramid
has
been
targeted
in
the
past,
even
by
those
who
infiltrated
our
brotherhood
with
unworthy
motives.
Peter's
choice
to
store
it
outside
the
brotherhood
was
a
clever
one."
"Were
you
aware
I
had
the
capstone?"
Langdon
asked.
"No.
And
if
Peter
told
anyone
at
all,
it
would
have
been
only
one
man."
Bellamy
pulled
out
his
cell
phone
and
hit
redial.
"And
so
far,
I've
been
unable
to
reach
him."
He
got
a
voice-mail
greeting
and
hung
up.
"Well,
Robert,
it
looks
like
you
and
I
are
on
our
own
for
the
moment.
And
we
have
a
decision
to
make."
Langdon
looked
at
his
Mickey
Mouse
watch.
9:42
P.M.
"You
do
realize
that
Peter's
captor
is
waiting
for
me
to
decipher
this
pyramid
tonight
and
tell
him
what
it
says."
Bellamy
frowned.
"Great
men
throughout
history
have
made
deep
personal
sacrifices
to
protect
the
Ancient
Mysteries.
You
and
I
must
do
the
same."
He
stood
up
now.
"We
should
keep
moving.
Sooner
or
later
Sato
will
figure
out
where
we
are."
"What
about
Katherine?!"
Langdon
demanded,
not
wanting
to
leave.
"I
can't
reach
her,
and
she
never
called."
"Obviously,
something
happened."
"But
we
can't
just
abandon
her!"
"Forget
Katherine!"
Bellamy
said,
his
voice
commanding
now.
"Forget
Peter!
Forget
everyone!
Don't
you
understand,
Robert,
that
you've
been
entrusted
with
a
duty
that
is
bigger
than
all
of
us
you,
Peter,
Katherine,
myself?"
He
locked
eyes
with
Langdon.
"We
need
to
find
a
safe
place
to
hide
this
pyramid
and
capstone
far
from
A
loud
metallic
crash
echoed
in
the
direction
of
the
great
hall.
Bellamy
wheeled,
eyes
filling
with
fear.
"That
was
fast."
Langdon
turned
toward
the
door.
The
sound
apparently
had
come
from
the
metal
bucket
that
Bellamy
had
placed
on
the
ladder
blocking
the
tunnel
doors.
They're
coming
for
us.
Then,
quite
unexpectedly,
the
crash
echoed
again.
And
again.
And
again.
The
homeless
man
on
the
bench
in
front
of
the
Library
of
Congress
rubbed
his
eyes
and
watched
the
strange
scene
unfolding
before
him.
A
white
Volvo
had
just
jumped
the
curb,
lurched
across
the
deserted
pedestrian
walkway,
and
screeched
to
a
halt
at
the
foot
of
the
library's
main
entrance.
An
attractive,
dark-haired
woman
had
leaped
out,
anxiously
surveyed
the
area,
and,
spotting
the
homeless
man,
had
shouted,
"Do
you
have
a
phone?"
Lady,
I
don
't
have
a
left
shoe.
Apparently
realizing
as
much,
the
woman
dashed
up
the
staircase
toward
the
library's
main
doors.
Arriving
at
the
top
of
the
stairs,
she
grabbed
the
handle
and
tried
desperately
to
open
each
of
the
three
giant
doors.
The
library
's
closed,
lady.
But
the
woman
didn't
seem
to
care.
She
seized
one
of
the
heavy
ring-shaped
handles,
heaved
it
backward,
and
let
it
fall
with
a
loud
crash
against
the
door.
Then
she
did
it
again.
And
again.
And
again.
Wow,
the
homeless
man
thought,
she
must
really
need
a
book.
When
Katherine
Solomon
finally
saw
the
massive
bronze
doors
of
the
library
swing
open
before
her,
she
felt
as
if
an
emotional
floodgate
had
burst.
All
the
fear
and
confusion
she
had
bottled
up
tonight
came
pouring
through.
The
figure
in
the
library
doorway
was
Warren
Bellamy,
a
friend
and
confidant
of
her
brother's.
But
it
was
the
man
behind
Bellamy
in
the
shadows
whom
Katherine
felt
happiest
to
see.
The
feeling
was
apparently
mutual.
Robert
Langdon'
s
eyes
filled
with
relief
as
she
rushed
through
the
doorway
directly
into
his
arms.
As
Katherine
lost
herself
in
the
comforting
embrace
of
an
old
friend,
Bellamy
closed
the
front
door.
She
heard
the
heavy
lock
click
into
place,
and
at
last
she
felt
safe.
Tears
came
unexpectedly,
but
she
fought
them
back.
Langdon
held
her.
"It's
okay,"
he
whispered.
"You're
okay."
Because
you
saved
me,
Katherine
wanted
to
tell
him.
He
destroyed
my
lab
all
my
work.
Years
of
research
up
in
smoke.
She
wanted
to
tell
him
everything,
but
she
could
barely
breathe.
"We'll
find
Peter."
Langdon's
deep
voice
resonated
against
her
chest,
comforting
her
somehow.
"I
promise."
/
know
who
did
this!
Katherine
wanted
to
yell.
The
same
man
who
killed
my
mother
and
nephew!
Before
she
could
explain
herself,
an
unexpected
sound
broke
the
silence
of
the
library.
The
loud
crash
echoed
up
from
beneath
them
in
a
vestibule
stairwell
as
if
a
large
metal
object
had
fallen
on
a
tile
floor.
Katherine
felt
Langdon's
muscles
stiffen
instantly.
Bellamy
stepped
forward,
his
expression
dire.
"We're
leaving.
Now."
Bewildered,
Katherine
followed
as
the
Architect
and
Langdon
hurried
across
the
great
hall
toward
the
library's
famed
reading
room,
which
was
ablaze
with
light.
Bellamy
quickly
locked
the
two
sets
of
doors
behind
them,
first
the
outer,
then
the
inner.
Katherine
followed
in
a
daze
as
Bellamy
hustled
them
both
toward
the
center
of
the
room.
The
threesome
arrived
at
a
reading
desk
where
a
leather
bag
sat
beneath
a
light.
Beside
the
bag,
there
was
a
tiny
cube-shaped
package,
which
Bellamy
scooped
up
and
placed
inside
the
bag,
alongside
a
Katherine
stopped
short.
A
pyramid?
Although
she
had
never
seen
this
engraved
stone
pyramid,
she
felt
her
entire
body
recoil
in
recognition.
Somehow
her
gut
knew
the
truth.
Katherine
Solomon
had
just
come
face-to-face
with
the
object
that
had
so
deeply
damaged
her
life.
The
pyramid.
Bellamy
zipped
up
the
bag
and
handed
it
to
Langdon.
"Don't
let
this
out
of
your
sight."
A
sudden
explosion
rocked
the
room's
outer
doors.
The
tinkling
of
shattered
glass
followed.
"This
way!"
Bellamy
spun,
looking
scared
now
as
he
rushed
them
over
to
the
central
circulation
desk
eight
counters
around
a
massive
octagonal
cabinet.
He
guided
them
in
behind
the
counters
and
then
pointed
to
an
opening
in
the
cabinet.
"Get
in
there!"
"In
thereV
Langdon
demanded.
"They'll
find
us
for
sure!"
"Trust
me,"
Bellamy
said.
"It's
not
what
you
think."
Mal'akh
gunned
his
limousine
north
toward
Kalorama
Heights.
The
explosion
in
Katherine'
s
lab
had
been
bigger
than
he
had
anticipated,
and
he
had
been
lucky
to
escape
unscathed.
Conveniently,
the
ensuing
chaos
had
enabled
him
to
slip
out
without
opposition,
powering
his
limousine
past
a
distracted
gate
guard
who
was
busy
yelling
into
a
telephone.
I've
got
to
get
off
the
road,
he
thought.
If
Katherine
hadn't
yet
phoned
the
police,
the
explosion
would
certainly
draw
their
attention.
And
a
shirtless
man
driving
a
limousine
would
be
hard
to
miss.
After
years
of
preparation,
Mal'akh
could
scarcely
believe
the
night
was
now
upon
him.
The
journey
to
this
moment
had
been
a
long,
difficult
one.
What
began
years
ago
in
misery
will
end
tonight
in
glory.
On
the
night
it
all
began,
he
had
not
had
the
name
Mal'akh.
In
fact,
on
the
night
it
all
began,
he
had
not
had
any
name
at
all.
Inmate
37.
Like
most
of
the
prisoners
at
the
brutal
Soganlik
Prison
outside
of
Istanbul,
Inmate
37
was
here
because
of
drugs.
He
had
been
lying
on
his
bunk
in
a
cement
cell,
hungry
and
cold
in
the
darkness,
wondering
how
long
he
would
be
incarcerated.
His
new
cellmate,
whom
he'd
met
only
twenty-four
hours
ago,
was
sleeping
in
the
bunk
above
him.
The
prison
administrator,
an
obese
alcoholic
who
hated
his
job
and
took
it
out
on
the
inmates,
had
just
killed
all
the
lights
for
the
night.
It
was
almost
ten
o'clock
when
Inmate
37
heard
the
conversation
filtering
in
through
the
ventilation
shaft.
The
first
voice
was
unmistakably
clear
the
piercing,
belligerent
accent
of
the
prison
administrator,
who
clearly
did
not
appreciate
being
woken
up
by
a
late-night
visitor.
"Yes,
yes,
you've
come
a
long
way,"
he
was
saying,
"but
there
are
no
visitors
for
the
first
month.
State
regulations.
No
exceptions."
The
voice
that
replied
was
soft
and
refined,
filled
with
pain.
"Is
my
son
safe?"
"He
is
a
drug
addict."
"Is
he
being
treated
well?"
"Well
enough,"
the
administrator
said.
"This
is
not
a
hotel."
There
was
a
pained
pause.
"You
do
realize
the
U.S.
State
Department
will
request
extradition."
"Yes,
yes,
they
always
do.
It
will
be
granted,
although
the
paperwork
might
take
us
a
couple
of
weeks
or
even
a
month
depending."
"Depending
on
what?"
"Well,"
the
administrator
said,
"we
are
understaffed."
He
paused.
"Of
course,
sometimes
concerned
parties
like
yourself
make
donations
to
the
prison
staff
to
help
us
push
things
through
more
quickly."
The
visitor
did
not
reply.
"Mr.
Solomon,"
the
administrator
continued,
lowering
his
voice,
"for
a
man
like
yourself,
for
whom
money
is
no
object,
there
are
always
options.
I
know
people
in
government.
If
you
and
I
work
together,
we
may
be
able
to
get
your
son
out
of
here
tomorrow,
with
all
the
charges
dropped.
He
would
not
even
have
to
face
prosecution
at
home."
The
response
was
immediate.
"Forgetting
the
legal
ramifications
of
your
suggestion,
I
refuse
to
teach
my
son
that
money
solves
all
problems
or
that
there
is
no
accountability
in
life,
especially
in
a
serious
matter
like
this."
"You'd
like
to
leave
him
here?"
"I'd
like
to
speak
to
him.
Right
now."
"As
I
said,
we
have
rules.
Your
son
is
unavailable
to
you
unless
you
would
like
to
negotiate
his
immediate
release."
A
cold
silence
hung
for
several
moments.
"The
State
Department
will
be
contacting
you.
Keep
Zachary
safe.
I
expect
him
on
a
plane
home
within
the
week.
Good
night."
The
door
slammed.
Inmate
37
could
not
believe
his
ears.
What
kind
of
father
leaves
his
son
in
this
hellhole
in
order
to
teach
him
a
lesson?
Peter
Solomon
had
even
rejected
an
offer
to
clear
Zachary's
record.
It
was
later
that
night,
lying
awake
in
his
bunk,
that
Inmate
37
had
realized
how
he
would
free
himself.
If
money
was
the
only
thing
separating
a
prisoner
from
freedom,
then
Inmate
37
was
as
good
as
free.
Peter
Solomon
might
not
be
willing
to
part
with
money,
but
as
anyone
who
read
the
tabloids
knew,
his
son,
Zachary,
had
plenty
of
money,
too.
The
next
day,
Inmate
37
spoke
privately
to
the
administrator
and
suggested
a
plan
a
bold,
ingenious
scheme
that
would
give
them
both
exactly
what
they
wanted.
"Zachary
Solomon
would
have
to
die
for
this
to
work,"
explained
Inmate
37.
"But
we
could
both
disappear
immediately.
You
could
retire
to
the
Greek
Islands.
You
would
never
see
this
place
again."
After
some
discussion,
the
two
men
shook
hands.
Soon
Zachary
Solomon
will
be
dead,
Inmate
37
thought,
smiling
to
think
how
easy
it
would
be.
It
was
two
days
later
that
the
State
Department
contacted
the
Solomon
family
with
the
horrific
news.
The
prison
snapshots
showed
their
son's
brutally
bludgeoned
body,
lying
curled
and
lifeless
on
the
floor
of
his
prison
cell.
His
head
had
been
bashed
in
by
a
steel
bar,
and
the
rest
of
him
was
battered
and
twisted
beyond
what
was
humanly
imaginable.
He
appeared
to
have
been
tortured
and
finally
killed.
The
prime
suspect
was
the
prison
administrator
himself,
who
had
disappeared,
probably
with
all
of
the
murdered
boy's
money.
Zachary
had
signed
papers
moving
his
vast
fortune
into
a
private
numbered
account,
which
had
been
emptied
immediately
following
his
death.
There
was
no
telling
where
the
money
was
now.
Peter
Solomon
flew
to
Turkey
on
a
private
jet
and
returned
with
their
son's
casket,
which
they
buried
in
the
Solomon
family
cemetery.
The
prison
administrator
was
never
found.
Nor
would
he
be,
Inmate
37
knew.
The
Turk's
rotund
body
was
now
resting
at
the
bottom
of
the
Sea
of
Marmara,
feeding
the
blue
manna
crabs
that
migrated
in
through
the
Bosporus
Strait.
The
vast
fortune
belonging
to
Zachary
Solomon
had
all
been
moved
to
an
untraceable
numbered
account.
Inmate
37
was
a
free
man
again
a
free
man
with
a
massive
fortune.
The
Greek
Islands
were
like
heaven.
The
light.
The
water.
The
women.
There
was
nothing
money
couldn't
buy
new
identities,
new
passports,
new
hope.
He
chose
a
Greek
name
Andros
Dareios
Andros
meaning
"warrior,"
and
Dareios
meaning
"wealthy."
The
dark
nights
in
prison
had
frightened
him,
and
Andros
vowed
never
to
go
back.
He
shaved
off
his
shaggy
hair
and
shunned
the
drug
world
entirely.
He
began
life
anew
exploring
never-before-imagined
sensual
pleasures.
The
serenity
of
sailing
alone
on
the
ink-blue
Aegean
Sea
became
his
new
heroin
trance;
the
sensuality
of
sucking
moist
ami
souvlakia
right
off
the
skewer
became
his
new
Ecstasy;
and
the
rash
of
cliff
diving
into
the
foam-filled
ravines
of
Mykonos
became
his
new
cocaine.
/
am
reborn.
Andros
bought
a
sprawling
villa
on
the
island
of
Syros
and
settled
in
among
the
bella
gente
in
the
exclusive
town
of
Possidonia.
This
new
world
was
a
community
not
only
of
wealth,
but
of
culture
and
physical
perfection.
His
neighbors
took
great
pride
in
their
bodies
and
minds,
and
it
was
contagious.
The
newcomer
suddenly
found
himself
jogging
on
the
beach,
tanning
his
pale
body,
and
reading
books.
Andros
read
Homer's
Odyssey,
captivated
by
the
images
of
powerful
bronze
men
doing
battle
on
these
islands.
The
next
day,
he
began
lifting
weights,
and
was
amazed
to
see
how
quickly
his
chest
and
arms
grew
larger.
Gradually,
he
began
to
feel
women's
eyes
on
him,
and
the
admiration
was
intoxicating.
He
longed
to
grow
stronger
still.
And
he
did.
With
the
help
of
aggressive
cycles
of
steroids
intermixed
with
black-market
growth
hormones
and
endless
hours
of
weight
lifting,
Andros
transformed
himself
into
something
he
had
never
imagined
he
could
be
a
perfect
male
specimen.
He
grew
in
both
height
and
musculature,
developing
flawless
pectorals
and
massive,
sinewy
legs,
which
he
kept
perfectly
tanned.
Everyone
was
looking
now.
As
Andros
had
been
warned,
the
heavy
steroids
and
hormones
changed
not
only
his
body,
but
also
his
voice
box,
giving
him
an
eerie,
breathy
whisper,
which
made
him
feel
more
mysterious.
The
soft,
enigmatic
voice,
combined
with
his
new
body,
his
wealth,
and
his
refusal
to
speak
about
his
mysterious
past,
served
as
catnip
for
the
women
who
met
him.
They
gave
themselves
willingly,
and
he
satisfied
them
all
from
fashion
models
visiting
his
island
on
photo
shoots,
to
nubile
American
college
girls
on
vacation,
to
the
lonely
wives
of
his
neighbors,
to
the
occasional
young
man.
They
could
not
get
enough.
/
am
a
masterpiece.
As
the
years
passed,
however,
Andros's
sexual
adventures
began
to
lose
their
thrill.
As
did
everything.
The
island's
sumptuous
cuisine
lost
its
taste,
books
no
longer
held
his
interest,
and
even
the
dazzling
sunsets
from
his
villa
looked
dull.
How
could
this
be?
He
was
only
in
his
midtwenties,
and
yet
he
felt
old.
What
more
is
there
to
life?
He
had
sculpted
his
body
into
a
masterpiece;
he
had
educated
himself
and
nourished
his
mind
with
culture;
he
had
made
his
home
in
paradise;
and
he
had
the
love
of
anyone
he
desired.
And
yet,
incredibly,
he
felt
as
empty
as
he
had
in
that
Turkish
prison.
What
is
it
I
am
missing?
The
answer
had
come
to
him
several
months
later.
Andros
was
sitting
alone
in
his
villa,
absently
surfing
channels
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
when
he
stumbled
across
a
program
about
the
secrets
of
Freemasonry.
The
show
was
poorly
done,
posing
more
questions
than
answers,
and
yet
he
found
himself
intrigued
by
the
plethora
of
conspiracy
theories
surrounding
the
brotherhood.
The
narrator
described
legend
after
legend.
Freemasons
and
the
New
World
Order
The
Great
Masonic
Seal
of
the
United
States
The
P2
Masonic
Lodge
The
Lost
Secret
of
Freemasonry
The
Masonic
Pyramid
Andros
sat
up,
startled.
Pyramid.
The
narrator
began
recounting
the
story
of
a
mysterious
stone
pyramid
whose
encrypted
engraving
promised
to
lead
to
lost
wisdom
and
unfathomable
power.
The
story,
though
seemingly
implausible,
sparked
in
him
a
distant
memory
a
faint
recollection
from
a
much
darker
time.
Andros
remembered
what
Zachary
Solomon
had
heard
from
his
father
about
a
mysterious
pyramid.
Could
it
be?
Andros
strained
to
recall
the
details.
When
the
show
ended,
he
stepped
out
onto
the
balcony,
letting
the
cool
air
clear
his
mind.
He
remembered
more
now,
and
as
it
all
came
back,
he
began
to
sense
there
might
be
some
truth
to
this
legend
after
all.
And
if
so,
then
Zachary
Solomon
although
long
dead
still
had
something
to
offer.
What
do
I
have
to
lose
?
Three
weeks
later,
his
timing
carefully
planned,
Andros
stood
in
the
frigid
cold
outside
the
conservatory
of
the
Solomons'
Potomac
estate.
Through
the
glass,
he
could
see
Peter
Solomon
chatting
and
laughing
with
his
sister,
Katherine.
It
looks
like
they've
had
no
trouble
forgetting
Zachary,
he
thought.
Before
he
pulled
the
ski
mask
over
his
face,
Andros
took
a
hit
of
cocaine,
his
first
in
ages.
He
felt
the
familiar
rush
of
fearlessness.
He
pulled
out
a
handgun,
used
an
old
key
to
unlock
the
door,
and
stepped
inside.
"Hello,
Solomons."
Unfortunately,
the
night
had
not
gone
as
Andros
had
planned.
Rather
than
obtaining
the
pyramid
for
which
he
had
come,
he
found
himself
riddled
with
bird
shot
and
fleeing
across
the
snow-covered
lawn
toward
the
dense
woods.
To
his
surprise,
behind
him,
Peter
Solomon
was
giving
chase,
pistol
glinting
in
his
hand.
Andros
dashed
into
the
woods,
running
down
a
trail
along
the
edge
of
a
deep
ravine.
Far
below,
the
sounds
of
a
waterfall
echoed
up
through
the
crisp
winter
air.
He
passed
a
stand
of
oak
trees
and
rounded
a
corner
to
his
left.
Seconds
later,
he
was
skidding
to
a
stop
on
the
icy
path,
narrowly
escaping
death.
My
God!
Only
feet
in
front
of
him,
the
path
ended,
plunging
straight
down
into
an
icy
river
far
below.
The
large
boulder
at
the
side
of
the
path
had
been
carved
by
the
unskilled
hand
of
a
child:
On
the
far
side
of
the
ravine,
the
path
continued
on.
So
where'
s
the
bridge?!
The
cocaine
was
no
longer
working.
I'm
trapped!
Panicking
now,
Andros
turned
to
flee
back
up
the
path,
but
he
found
himself
facing
Peter
Solomon,
who
stood
breathless
before
him,
pistol
in
hand.
Andros
looked
at
the
gun
and
took
a
step
backward.
The
drop
behind
him
was
at
least
fifty
feet
to
an
ice-
covered
river.
The
mist
from
the
waterfall
upstream
billowed
around
them,
chilling
him
to
the
bone.
"Zach's
bridge
rotted
out
long
ago,"
Solomon
said,
panting.
"He
was
the
only
one
who
ever
came
down
this
far."
Solomon
held
the
gun
remarkably
steady.
"Why
did
you
kill
my
son?"
"He
was
nothing,"
Andros
replied.
"A
drug
addict.
I
did
him
a
favor."
Solomon
moved
closer,
gun
aimed
directly
at
Andros
's
chest.
"Perhaps
I
should
do
you
the
same
favor."
His
tone
was
surprisingly
fierce.
"You
bludgeoned
my
son
to
death.
How
does
a
man
do
such
a
thing?"
"Men
do
the
unthinkable
when
pushed
to
the
brink."
"You
killed
my
son!"
"No,"
Andros
replied,
hotly
now.
"You
killed
your
son.
What
kind
of
man
leaves
his
son
in
a
prison
when
he
has
the
option
to
get
him
out!
You
killed
your
son!
Not
me."
"You
know
nothing!"
Solomon
yelled,
his
voice
filled
with
pain.
You
're
wrong,
Andros
thought.
/
know
everything.
Peter
Solomon
drew
closer,
only
five
yards
away
now,
gun
leveled.
Andros
's
chest
was
burning,
and
he
could
tell
he
was
bleeding
badly.
The
warmth
ran
down
over
his
stomach.
He
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
drop.
Impossible.
He
turned
back
to
Solomon.
"I
know
more
about
you
than
you
think,"
he
whispered.
"I
know
you
are
not
the
kind
of
man
who
kills
in
cold
blood."
Solomon
stepped
closer,
taking
dead
aim.
"I'm
warning
you,"
Andros
said,
"if
you
pull
that
trigger,
I
will
haunt
you
forever."
"You
already
will."
And
with
that,
Solomon
fired.
As
he
raced
his
black
limousine
back
toward
Kalorama
Heights,
the
one
who
now
called
himself
Mal'akh
reflected
on
the
miraculous
events
that
had
delivered
him
from
certain
death
atop
that
icy
ravine.
He
had
been
transformed
forever.
The
gunshot
had
echoed
only
for
an
instant,
and
yet
its
effects
had
reverberated
across
decades.
His
body,
once
tanned
and
perfect,
was
now
marred
by
scars
from
that
night
scars
he
kept
hidden
beneath
the
tattooed
symbols
of
his
new
identity.
/
am
Mai
'akh.
This
was
my
destiny
all
along.
He
had
walked
through
fire,
been
reduced
to
ashes,
and
then
emerged
again
transformed
once
more.
Tonight
would
be
the
final
step
of
his
long
and
magnificent
journey.
The
coyly
nicknamed
explosive
Key4
had
been
developed
by
Special
Forces
specifically
for
opening
locked
doors
with
minimal
collateral
damage.
Consisting
primarily
of
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine
with
a
diethylhexyl
plasticizer,
it
was
essentially
a
piece
of
C-4
rolled
into
paper-thin
sheets
for
insertion
into
doorjambs.
In
the
case
of
the
library's
reading
room,
the
explosive
had
worked
perfectly.
Operation
leader
Agent
Turner
Simkins
stepped
over
the
wreckage
of
the
doors
and
scanned
the
massive
octagonal
room
for
any
signs
of
movement.
Nothing.
"Kill
the
lights,"
Simkins
said.
A
second
agent
found
the
wall
panel,
threw
the
switches,
and
plunged
the
room
into
darkness.
In
unison,
all
four
men
reached
up
and
yanked
down
their
night-
vision
headgear,
adjusting
the
goggles
over
their
eyes.
They
stood
motionless,
surveying
the
reading
room,
which
now
materialized
in
shades
of
luminescent
green
inside
their
goggles.
The
scene
remained
unchanged.
Nobody
made
a
dash
for
it
in
the
dark.
The
fugitives
were
probably
unarmed,
and
yet
the
field
team
entered
the
room
with
weapons
raised.
In
the
darkness,
their
firearms
projected
four
menacing
rods
of
laser
light.
The
men
washed
the
beams
in
all
directions,
across
the
floor,
up
the
far
walls,
into
the
balconies,
probing
the
darkness.
Oftentimes,
a
mere
glimpse
of
a
laser-sighted
weapon
in
a
darkened
room
was
enough
to
induce
instant
surrender.
Apparently
not
tonight.
Still
no
movement.
Agent
Simkins
raised
his
hand,
motioning
his
team
into
the
space.
Silently,
the
men
fanned
out.
Moving
cautiously
up
the
center
aisle,
Simkins
reached
up
and
flipped
a
switch
on
his
goggles,
activating
the
newest
addition
to
the
CIA's
arsenal.
Thermal
imaging
had
been
around
for
years,
but
recent
advances
in
miniaturization,
differential
sensitivity,
and
dual-source
integration
had
facilitated
a
new
generation
of
vision
enhancing
equipment
that
gave
field
agents
eyesight
that
bordered
on
superhuman.
We
see
in
the
dark.
We
see
through
walls.
And
now
we
see
back
in
time.
Thermal-imaging
equipment
had
become
so
sensitive
to
heat
differentials
that
it
could
detect
not
only
a
person's
location
but
their
previous
locations.
The
ability
to
see
into
the
past
often
proved
the
most
valuable
asset
of
all.
And
tonight,
once
again,
it
proved
its
worth.
Agent
Simkins
now
spied
a
thermal
signature
at
one
of
the
reading
desks.
The
two
wooden
chairs
luminesced
in
his
goggles,
registering
a
reddish-purple
color,
indicating
those
chairs
were
warmer
than
the
other
chairs
in
the
room.
The
desk
lamp's
bulb
glowed
orange.
Obviously
the
two
men
had
been
sitting
at
the
desk,
but
the
question
now
was
in
which
direction
they
had
gone.
He
found
his
answer
on
the
central
counter
that
surrounded
the
large
wooden
console
in
the
middle
of
the
room.
A
ghostly
handprint,
glowing
crimson.
Weapon
raised,
Simkins
moved
toward
the
octagonal
cabinet,
training
his
laser
sight
across
the
surface.
He
circled
until
he
saw
an
opening
in
the
side
of
the
console.
Did
they
really
corner
themselves
in
a
cabinet?
The
agent
scanned
the
trim
around
the
opening
and
saw
another
glowing
handprint
on
it.
Clearly
someone
had
grabbed
the
doorjamb
as
he
ducked
inside
the
console.
The
time
for
silence
was
over.
"Thermal
signature!"
Simkins
shouted,
pointing
at
the
opening.
"Flanks
converge!"
His
two
flanks
moved
in
from
opposite
sides,
effectively
surrounding
the
octagonal
console.
Simkins
moved
toward
the
opening.
Still
ten
feet
away,
he
could
see
a
light
source
within.
"Light
inside
the
console!"
he
shouted,
hoping
the
sound
of
his
voice
might
convince
Mr.
Bellamy
and
Mr.
Langdon
to
exit
the
cabinet
with
their
hands
up.
Nothing
happened.
Fine,
we
'11
do
this
the
other
way.
As
Simkins
drew
closer
to
the
opening,
he
could
hear
an
unexpected
hum
rumbling
from
within.
It
sounded
like
machinery.
He
paused,
trying
to
imagine
what
could
be
making
such
a
noise
in
such
a
small
space.
He
inched
closer,
now
hearing
voices
over
the
sound
of
machinery.
Then,
just
as
he
arrived
at
the
opening,
the
lights
inside
went
out.
Thank
you,
he
thought,
adjusting
his
night
vision.
Advantage,
us.
Standing
at
the
threshold,
he
peered
through
the
opening.
What
lay
beyond
was
unexpected.
The
console
was
less
of
a
cabinet
than
a
raised
ceiling
over
a
steep
set
of
stairs
that
descended
into
a
room
below.
The
agent
aimed
his
weapon
down
the
stairs
and
began
descending.
The
hum
of
machinery
grew
louder
with
every
step.
What
the
hell
is
this
place?
The
room
beneath
the
reading
room
was
a
small,
industrial-looking
space.
The
hum
he
heard
was
indeed
machinery,
although
he
was
not
sure
whether
it
was
running
because
Bellamy
and
Langdon
had
activated
it,
or
because
it
ran
around
the
clock.
Either
way,
it
clearly
made
no
difference.
The
fugitives
had
left
their
telltale
heat
signatures
on
the
room's
lone
exit
a
heavy
steel
door
whose
keypad
showed
four
clear
fingerprints
glowing
on
the
numbers.
Around
the
door,
slivers
of
glowing
orange
shone
beneath
the
doorjamb,
indicating
that
lights
were
illuminated
on
the
other
side.
"Blow
the
door,"
Simkins
said.
"This
was
their
escape
route."
It
took
eight
seconds
to
insert
and
detonate
a
sheet
of
Key4.
When
the
smoke
cleared,
the
field-team
agents
found
themselves
peering
into
a
strange
underground
world
known
here
as
"the
stacks."
The
Library
of
Congress
had
miles
and
miles
of
bookshelves,
most
of
them
underground.
The
endless
rows
of
shelves
looked
like
some
kind
of
"infinity"
optical
illusion
created
with
mirrors.
A
sign
announced
TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED
ENVIRONMENT
Keep
this
door
closed
at
all
times.
Simkins
pushed
through
the
mangled
doors
and
felt
cool
air
beyond.
He
couldn't
help
but
smile.
Could
this
get
any
easier?
Heat
signatures
in
controlled
environments
showed
up
like
solar
flares,
and
already
his
goggles
revealed
a
glowing
red
smear
on
a
banister
up
ahead,
which
Bellamy
or
Langdon
had
grabbed
on
to
while
running
past.
"You
can
run,"
he
whispered
to
himself,
"but
you
can't
hide."
As
Simkins
and
his
team
advanced
into
the
maze
of
stacks,
he
realized
the
playing
field
was
tipped
so
heavily
in
his
favor
that
he
would
not
even
need
his
goggles
to
track
his
prey.
Under
normal
circumstances,
this
maze
of
stacks
would
have
been
a
respectable
hiding
place,
but
the
Library
of
Congress
used
motion-
activated
lights
to
save
energy,
and
the
fugitives'
escape
route
was
now
lit
up
like
a
runway.
A
narrow
strip
of
illumination
stretched
into
the
distance,
dodging
and
weaving
as
it
went.
All
the
men
ripped
off
their
goggles.
Surging
ahead
on
well-trained
legs,
the
field
team
followed
the
trail
of
lights,
zigging
and
zagging
through
a
seemingly
endless
labyrinth
of
books.
Soon
Simkins
began
seeing
lights
flickering
on
in
the
darkness
up
ahead.
We're
gaining.
He
pushed
harder,
faster,
until
he
heard
footsteps
and
labored
breathing
ahead.
Then
he
saw
a
target.
"I've
got
visual!"
he
yelled.
The
lanky
form
of
Warren
Bellamy
was
apparently
bringing
up
the
rear.
The
primly
dressed
African
American
staggered
through
the
stacks,
obviously
out
of
breath.
It's
no
use,
old
man.
"Stop
right
there,
Mr.
Bellamy!"
Simkins
yelled.
Bellamy
kept
running,
turning
sharp
corners,
weaving
through
the
rows
of
books.
At
every
turn,
the
lights
kept
coming
on
over
his
head.
As
the
team
drew
within
twenty
yards,
they
shouted
again
to
stop,
but
Bellamy
ran
on.
"Take
him
down!"
Simkins
commanded.
The
agent
carrying
the
team's
nonlethal
rifle
raised
it
and
fired.
The
projectile
that
launched
down
the
aisle
and
wrapped
itself
around
Bellamy's
legs
was
nicknamed
Silly
String,
but
there
was
nothing
silly
about
it.
A
military
technology
invented
at
Sandia
National
Laboratories,
this
nonlethal
"incapacitant"
was
a
thread
of
gooey
polyurethane
that
turned
rock
hard
on
contact,
creating
a
rigid
web
of
plastic
across
the
back
of
the
fugitive's
knees.
The
effect
on
a
running
target
was
that
of
jamming
a
stick
into
the
spokes
of
a
moving
bike.
The
man's
legs
seized
midstride,
and
he
pitched
forward,
crashing
to
the
floor.
Bellamy
slid
another
ten
feet
down
a
darkened
aisle
before
coming
to
a
stop,
the
lights
above
him
flickering
unceremoniously
to
life.
"I'll
deal
with
Bellamy,"
Simkins
shouted.
"You
keep
going
after
Langdon!
He
must
be
up
ahead
some
The
team
leader
stopped,
now
seeing
that
the
library
stacks
ahead
of
Bellamy
were
all
pitch-black.
Obviously,
there
was
no
one
else
running
in
front
of
Bellamy.
He's
alone?
Bellamy
was
still
on
his
chest,
breathing
heavily,
his
legs
and
ankles
all
tangled
with
hardened
plastic.
The
agent
walked
over
and
used
his
foot
to
roll
the
old
man
over
onto
his
back.
"Where
is
he?!"
the
agent
demanded.
Bellamy's
lip
was
bleeding
from
the
fall.
"Where
is
whoT
Agent
Simkins
lifted
his
foot
and
placed
his
boot
squarely
on
Bellamy's
pristine
silk
tie.
Then
he
leaned
in,
applying
some
pressure.
"Believe
me,
Mr.
Bellamy,
you
do
not
want
to
play
this
game
with
me."
Robert
Langdon
felt
like
a
corpse.
He
lay
supine,
hands
folded
on
his
chest,
in
total
darkness,
trapped
in
the
most
confined
of
spaces.
Although
Katherine
lay
nearby
in
a
similar
position
near
his
head,
Langdon
could
not
see
her.
He
had
his
eyes
closed
to
prevent
himself
from
catching
even
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
his
frightening
predicament.
The
space
around
him
was
small.
Very
small.
Sixty
seconds
ago,
with
the
double
doors
of
the
reading
room
crashing
down,
he
and
Katherine
had
followed
Bellamy
into
the
octagonal
console,
down
a
steep
set
of
stairs,
and
into
the
unexpected
space
below.
Langdon
had
realized
at
once
where
they
were.
The
heart
of
the
library's
circulation
system.
Resembling
a
small
airport
baggage
distribution
center,
the
circulation
room
had
numerous
conveyor
belts
that
angled
off
in
different
directions.
Because
the
Library
of
Congress
was
housed
in
three
separate
buildings,
books
requested
in
the
reading
room
often
had
to
be
transported
great
distances
by
a
system
of
conveyors
through
a
web
of
underground
tunnels.
Bellamy
immediately
crossed
the
room
to
a
steel
door,
where
he
inserted
his
key
card,
typed
a
sequence
of
buttons,
and
pushed
open
the
door.
The
space
beyond
was
dark,
but
as
the
door
opened,
a
span
of
motion-
sensor
lights
flickered
to
life.
When
Langdon
saw
what
lay
beyond,
he
realized
he
was
looking
at
something
few
people
ever
saw.
The
Library
of
Congress
stacks.
He
felt
encouraged
by
Bellamy's
plan.
What
better
place
to
hide
than
in
a
giant
labyrinth?
Bellamy
did
not
guide
them
into
the
stacks,
however.
Instead,
he
propped
the
door
open
with
a
book
and
turned
back
to
face
them.
"I
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
explain
a
lot
more
to
you,
but
we
have
no
time."
He
gave
Langdon
his
key
card.
"You'll
need
this."
"You're
not
coming
with
us?"
Langdon
asked.
Bellamy
shook
his
head.
"You'll
never
make
it
unless
we
split
up.
The
most
important
thing
is
to
keep
that
pyramid
and
capstone
in
safe
hands."
Langdon
saw
no
other
way
out
except
the
stairs
back
up
to
the
reading
room.
"And
where
are
you
going?"
"I'll
coax
them
into
the
stacks
away
from
you,"
Bellamy
said.
"It's
all
I
can
do
to
help
you
escape."
Before
Langdon
could
ask
where
he
and
Katherine
were
supposed
to
go,
Bellamy
was
heaving
a
large
crate
of
books
off
one
of
the
conveyors.
"Lie
on
the
belt,"
Bellamy
said.
"Keep
your
hands
in."
Langdon
stared.
You
cannot
be
serious!
The
conveyor
belt
extended
a
short
distance
then
disappeared
into
a
dark
hole
in
the
wall.
The
opening
looked
large
enough
to
permit
passage
of
a
crate
of
books,
but
not
much
more.
Langdon
glanced
back
longingly
at
the
stacks.
"Forget
it,"
Bellamy
said.
"The
motion-sensor
lights
will
make
it
impossible
to
hide."
"Thermal
signature!"
a
voice
upstairs
shouted.
"Flanks
converge!"
Katherine
apparently
had
heard
all
she
needed
to
hear.
She
climbed
onto
the
conveyor
belt
with
her
head
only
a
few
feet
from
the
opening
in
the
wall.
She
crossed
her
hands
over
her
chest
like
a
mummy
in
a
sarcophagus.
Langdon
stood
frozen.
"Robert,"
Bellamy
urged,
"if
you
won't
do
this
for
me,
do
it
for
Peter."
The
voices
upstairs
sounded
closer
now.
As
if
in
a
dream,
Langdon
moved
to
the
conveyor.
He
slung
his
daybag
onto
the
belt
and
then
climbed
on,
placing
his
head
at
Katherine'
s
feet.
The
hard
rubber
conveyor
felt
cold
against
his
back.
He
stared
at
the
ceiling
and
felt
like
a
hospital
patient
preparing
for
insertion
headfirst
into
an
MRI
machine.
"Keep
your
phone
on,"
Bellamy
said.
"Someone
will
call
soon
and
offer
help.
Trust
him."
Someone
will
call?
Langdon
knew
that
Bellamy
had
been
trying
to
reach
someone
with
no
luck
and
had
left
a
message
earlier.
And
only
moments
ago,
as
they
hurried
down
the
spiral
staircase,
Bellamy
had
tried
one
last
time
and
gotten
through,
speaking
very
briefly
in
hushed
tones
and
then
hanging
up.
"Follow
the
conveyor
to
the
end,"
Bellamy
said.
"And
jump
off
quickly
before
you
circle
back.
Use
my
key
card
to
get
out."
"Get
out
of
whereir
Langdon
demanded.
But
Bellamy
was
already
pulling
levers.
All
the
different
conveyors
in
the
room
hummed
to
life.
Langdon
felt
himself
jolt
into
motion,
and
the
ceiling
began
moving
overhead.
God
save
me.
As
Langdon
approached
the
opening
in
the
wall,
he
looked
back
and
saw
Warren
Bellamy
race
through
the
doorway
into
the
stacks,
closing
the
door
behind
him.
An
instant
later,
Langdon
slid
into
the
darkness,
swallowed
up
by
the
library
just
as
a
glowing
red
laser
dot
came
dancing
down
the
stairs.
The
underpaid
female
security
guard
from
Preferred
Security
double-checked
the
Kalorama
Heights
address
on
her
call
sheet.
This
is
it?
The
gated
driveway
before
her
belonged
to
one
of
the
neighborhood's
largest
and
quietest
estates,
and
so
it
seemed
odd
that
911
had
just
received
an
urgent
call
about
it.
As
usual
with
unconfirmed
call-ins,
911
had
contacted
the
local
alarm
company
before
bothering
the
police.
The
guard
often
thought
the
alarm
company's
motto
"Your
first
line
of
defense"
could
just
as
easily
have
been
"False
alarms,
pranks,
lost
pets,
and
complaints
from
wacky
neighbors."
Tonight,
as
usual,
the
guard
had
arrived
with
no
details
about
the
specific
concern.
Above
my
pay
grade.
Her
job
was
simply
to
show
up
with
her
yellow
bubble
light
spinning,
assess
the
property,
and
report
anything
unusual.
Normally,
something
innocuous
had
tripped
the
house
alarm,
and
she
would
use
her
override
keys
to
reset
it.
This
house,
however,
was
silent.
No
alarm.
From
the
road,
everything
looked
dark
and
peaceful.
The
guard
buzzed
the
intercom
at
the
gate,
but
got
no
answer.
She
typed
her
override
code
to
open
the
gate
and
pulled
into
the
driveway.
Leaving
her
engine
running
and
her
bubble
light
spinning,
she
walked
up
to
the
front
door
and
rang
the
bell.
No
answer.
She
saw
no
lights
and
no
movement.
Reluctantly
following
procedure,
she
flicked
on
her
flashlight
to
begin
her
trek
around
the
house
to
check
the
doors
and
windows
for
signs
of
break-in.
As
she
rounded
the
corner,
a
black
stretch
limousine
drove
past
the
house,
slowing
for
a
moment
before
continuing
on.
Rubbernecking
neighbors.
Bit
by
bit,
she
made
her
way
around
the
house,
but
saw
nothing
out
of
place.
The
house
was
bigger
than
she
had
imagined,
and
by
the
time
she
reached
the
backyard,
she
was
shivering
from
the
cold.
Obviously
there
was
nobody
home.
"Dispatch?"
she
called
in
on
her
radio.
"I'm
on
the
Kalorama
Heights
call?
Owners
aren't
home.
No
signs
of
trouble.
Finished
the
perimeter
check.
No
indication
of
an
intruder.
False
alarm."
"Roger
that,"
the
dispatcher
replied.
"Have
a
good
night."
The
guard
put
her
radio
back
on
her
belt
and
began
retracing
her
steps,
eager
to
get
back
to
the
warmth
of
her
vehicle.
As
she
did
so,
however,
she
spotted
something
she
had
missed
earlier
a
tiny
speck
of
bluish
light
on
the
back
of
the
house.
Puzzled,
she
walked
over
to
it,
now
seeing
the
source
a
low
transom
window,
apparently
to
the
home's
basement.
The
glass
of
the
window
had
been
blacked
out,
coated
on
the
inside
with
an
opaque
paint.
Some
kind
of
darkroom
maybe?
The
bluish
glow
she
had
seen
was
emanating
through
a
tiny
spot
on
the
window
where
the
black
paint
had
started
to
peel.
She
crouched
down,
trying
to
peer
through,
but
she
couldn't
see
much
through
the
tiny
opening.
She
tapped
on
the
glass,
wondering
if
maybe
someone
was
working
down
there.
"Hello?"
she
shouted.
There
was
no
answer,
but
as
she
knocked
on
the
window,
the
paint
chip
suddenly
detached
and
fell
off,
affording
her
a
more
complete
view.
She
leaned
in,
nearly
pressing
her
face
to
the
window
as
she
scanned
the
basement.
Instantly,
she
wished
she
hadn't.
What
in
the
name
of
God?!
Transfixed,
she
remained
crouched
there
for
a
moment,
staring
in
abject
horror
at
the
scene
before
her.
Finally,
trembling,
the
guard
groped
for
the
radio
on
her
belt.
She
never
found
it.
A
sizzling
pair
of
Taser
prongs
slammed
into
the
back
of
her
neck,
and
a
searing
pain
shot
through
her
body.
Her
muscles
seized,
and
she
pitched
forward,
unable
even
to
close
her
eyes
before
her
face
hit
the
cold
ground.
Tonight
was
not
the
first
time
Warren
Bellamy
had
been
blindfolded.
Like
all
of
his
Masonic
brothers,
he
had
worn
the
ritual
"hoodwink"
during
his
ascent
to
the
upper
echelons
of
Masonry.
That,
however,
had
taken
place
among
trusted
friends.
Tonight
was
different.
These
rough-handed
men
had
bound
him,
placed
a
bag
on
his
head,
and
were
now
marching
him
through
the
library
stacks.
The
agents
had
physically
threatened
Bellamy
and
demanded
to
know
the
whereabouts
of
Robert
Langdon.
Knowing
his
aging
body
couldn't
take
much
punishment,
Bellamy
had
told
his
lie
quickly.
"Langdon
never
came
down
here
with
me!"
he
had
said,
gasping
for
air.
"I
told
him
to
go
up
to
the
balcony
and
hide
behind
the
Moses
statue,
but
I
don't
know
where
he
is
now!"
The
story
apparently
had
been
convincing,
because
two
of
the
agents
had
run
off
in
pursuit.
Now
the
remaining
two
agents
were
marching
him
in
silence
through
the
stacks.
Bellamy's
only
solace
was
in
knowing
Langdon
and
Katherine
were
whisking
the
pyramid
off
to
safety.
Soon
Langdon
would
be
contacted
by
a
man
who
could
offer
sanctuary.
Trust
him.
The
man
Bellamy
had
called
knew
a
great
deal
about
the
Masonic
Pyramid
and
the
secret
it
held
the
location
of
a
hidden
spiral
staircase
that
led
down
into
the
earth
to
the
hiding
place
of
potent
ancient
wisdom
buried
long
ago.
Bellamy
had
finally
gotten
through
to
the
man
as
they
were
escaping
the
reading
room,
and
he
felt
confident
that
his
short
message
would
be
understood
perfectly.
Now,
as
he
moved
in
total
darkness,
Bellamy
pictured
the
stone
pyramid
and
golden
capstone
in
Langdon'
s
bag.
It
has
been
many
years
since
those
two
pieces
were
in
the
same
room.
Bellamy
would
never
forget
that
painful
night.
The
first
of
many
for
Peter.
Bellamy
had
been
asked
to
come
to
the
Solomon
estate
in
Potomac
for
Zachary
Solomon's
eighteenth
birthday.
Zachary,
despite
being
a
rebellious
child,
was
a
Solomon,
which
meant
tonight,
following
family
tradition,
he
would
receive
his
inheritance.
Bellamy
was
one
of
Peter's
dearest
friends
and
a
trusted
Masonic
brother,
and
therefore
was
asked
to
attend
as
a
witness.
But
it
was
not
only
the
transference
of
money
that
Bellamy
had
been
asked
to
witness.
There
was
far
more
than
money
at
stake
tonight.
Bellamy
had
arrived
early
and
waited,
as
requested,
in
Peter's
private
study.
The
wonderful
old
room
smelled
of
leather,
wood
fires,
and
loose-leaf
tea.
Warren
was
seated
when
Peter
led
his
son,
Zachary,
into
the
room.
When
the
scrawny
eighteen-year-old
saw
Bellamy,
he
frowned.
"What
are
you
doing
here?"
"Bearing
witness,"
Bellamy
offered.
"Happy
birthday,
Zachary."
The
boy
mumbled
and
looked
away.
"Sit
down,
Zach,"
Peter
said.
Zachary
sat
in
the
solitary
chair
facing
his
father's
huge
wooden
desk.
Solomon
bolted
the
study
door.
Bellamy
took
a
seat
off
to
one
side.
Solomon
addressed
Zachary
in
a
serious
tone.
"Do
you
know
why
you're
here?"
"I
think
so,"
Zachary
said.
Solomon
sighed
deeply.
"I
know
you
and
I
have
not
seen
eye
to
eye
for
quite
some
time,
Zach.
I've
done
my
best
to
be
a
good
father
and
to
prepare
you
for
this
moment."
Zachary
said
nothing.
"As
you
know,
every
Solomon
child,
upon
reaching
adulthood,
is
presented
with
his
or
her
birthright
a
share
of
the
Solomon
fortune
which
is
intended
to
be
a
seed
a
seed
for
you
to
nurture,
make
grow,
and
use
to
help
nourish
mankind."
Solomon
walked
to
a
vault
in
the
wall,
unlocked
it,
and
removed
a
large
black
folder.
"Son,
this
portfolio
contains
everything
you
need
to
legally
transfer
your
financial
inheritance
into
your
own
name."
He
laid
it
on
the
desk.
"The
aim
is
that
you
use
this
money
to
build
a
life
of
productivity,
prosperity,
and
philanthropy."
Zachary
reached
for
the
folder.
"Thanks."
"Hold
on,"
his
father
said,
putting
his
hand
on
the
portfolio.
"There's
something
else
I
need
to
explain."
Zachary
shot
his
father
a
contemptuous
look
and
slumped
back
down.
"There
are
aspects
of
the
Solomon
inheritance
of
which
you
are
not
yet
aware."
His
father
was
staring
straight
into
Zachary'
s
eyes
now.
"You
are
my
firstborn,
Zachary,
which
means
you
are
entitled
to
a
choice."
The
teenager
sat
up,
looking
intrigued.
"It
is
a
choice
that
may
well
determine
the
direction
of
your
future,
and
so
I
urge
you
to
ponder
it
carefully."
"What
choice?"
His
father
took
a
deep
breath.
"It
is
the
choice
between
wealth
or
wisdom."
Zachary
gave
him
a
blank
stare.
"Wealth
or
wisdom?
I
don't
get
it."
Solomon
stood,
walking
again
to
the
vault,
where
he
pulled
out
a
heavy
stone
pyramid
with
Masonic
symbols
carved
into
it.
Peter
heaved
the
stone
onto
the
desk
beside
the
portfolio.
"This
pyramid
was
created
long
ago
and
has
been
entrusted
to
our
family
for
generations."
"A
pyramid?"
Zachary
didn't
look
very
excited.
"Son,
this
pyramid
is
a
map
a
map
that
reveals
the
location
of
one
of
humankind's
greatest
lost
treasures.
This
map
was
created
so
that
the
treasure
could
one
day
be
rediscovered."
Peter's
voice
swelled
now
with
pride.
"And
tonight,
following
tradition,
I
am
able
to
offer
it
to
you
under
certain
conditions."
Zachary
eyed
the
pyramid
suspiciously.
"What's
the
treasure?"
Bellamy
could
tell
that
this
coarse
question
was
not
what
Peter
had
hoped
for.
Nonetheless,
his
demeanor
remained
steady.
"Zachary,
it's
hard
to
explain
without
a
lot
of
background.
But
this
treasure
in
essence
is
something
we
call
the
Ancient
Mysteries."
Zachary
laughed,
apparently
thinking
his
father
was
joking.
Bellamy
could
see
the
melancholy
growing
now
in
Peter's
eyes.
"This
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
describe,
Zach.
Traditionally,
by
the
time
a
Solomon
is
eighteen
years
of
age,
he
is
about
to
embark
on
his
years
of
higher
education
in
"I
told
you!"
Zachary
fired
back.
"I'm
not
interested
in
college!"
"I
don't
mean
college,"
his
father
said,
his
voice
still
calm
and
quiet.
"I'm
talking
about
the
brotherhood
of
Freemasonry.
I'm
talking
about
an
education
in
the
enduring
mysteries
of
human
science.
If
you
had
plans
to
join
me
within
their
ranks,
you
would
be
on
the
verge
of
receiving
the
education
necessary
to
understand
the
importance
of
your
decision
tonight."
Zachary
rolled
his
eyes.
"Spare
me
the
Masonic
lecture
again.
I
know
I'm
the
first
Solomon
who
doesn't
want
to
join.
But
so
what?
Don't
you
get
it?
I
have
no
interest
in
playing
dress-up
with
a
bunch
of
old
men!"
His
father
was
silent
for
a
long
time,
and
Bellamy
noticed
the
fine
age
lines
that
had
started
to
appear
around
Peter's
still-youthful
eyes.
"Yes,
I
get
it,"
Peter
finally
said.
"Times
are
different
now.
I
understand
that
Masonry
probably
appears
strange
to
you,
or
maybe
even
boring.
But
I
want
you
to
know,
that
doorway
will
always
be
open
for
you
should
you
change
your
mind."
"Don't
hold
your
breath,"
Zach
grumbled.
"That's
enough!"
Peter
snapped,
standing
up.
"I
realize
life
has
been
a
struggle
for
you,
Zachary,
but
I
am
not
your
only
guidepost.
There
are
good
men
waiting
for
you,
men
who
will
welcome
you
within
the
Masonic
fold
and
show
you
your
true
potential."
Zachary
chuckled
and
glanced
over
at
Bellamy.
"Is
that
why
you're
here,
Mr.
Bellamy?
So
you
Masons
can
gang
up
on
me?"
Bellamy
said
nothing,
instead
directing
a
respectful
gaze
back
at
Peter
Solomon
a
reminder
to
Zachary
of
who
held
the
power
in
this
room.
Zachary
turned
back
to
his
father.
"Zach,"
Peter
said,
"we're
getting
nowhere
so
let
me
just
tell
you
this.
Whether
or
not
you
comprehend
the
responsibility
being
offered
to
you
tonight,
it
is
my
family
obligation
to
present
it."
He
motioned
to
the
pyramid.
"It
is
a
rare
privilege
to
guard
this
pyramid.
I
urge
you
to
consider
this
opportunity
for
a
few
days
before
making
your
decision."
"Opportunity?"
Zachary
said.
"Babysitting
a
rock?"
"There
are
great
mysteries
in
this
world,
Zach,"
Peter
said
with
a
sigh.
"Secrets
that
transcend
your
wildest
imagination.
This
pyramid
protects
those
secrets.
And
even
more
important,
there
will
come
a
time,
probably
within
your
lifetime,
when
this
pyramid
will
at
last
be
deciphered
and
its
secrets
unearthed.
It
will
be
a
moment
of
great
human
transformation
and
you
have
a
chance
to
play
a
role
in
that
moment.
I
want
you
to
consider
it
very
carefully.
Wealth
is
commonplace,
but
wisdom
is
rare."
He
motioned
to
the
portfolio
and
then
to
the
pyramid.
"I
beg
you
to
remember
that
wealth
without
wisdom
can
often
end
in
disaster."
Zachary
looked
like
he
thought
his
father
was
insane.
"Whatever
you
say,
Dad,
but
there's
no
way
I'm
giving
up
my
inheritance
for
this."
He
gestured
to
the
pyramid.
Peter
folded
his
hands
before
him.
"If
you
choose
to
accept
the
responsibility,
I
will
hold
your
money
and
the
pyramid
for
you
until
you
have
successfully
completed
your
education
within
the
Masons.
This
will
take
years,
but
you
will
emerge
with
the
maturity
to
receive
both
your
money
and
this
pyramid.
Wealth
and
wisdom.
A
potent
combination."
Zachary
shot
up.
"Jesus,
Dad!
You
don't
give
up,
do
you?
Can't
you
see
that
I
don't
give
a
damn
about
the
Masons
or
stone
pyramids
and
ancient
mysteries?"
He
reached
down
and
scooped
up
the
black
portfolio,
waving
it
in
front
of
his
father's
face.
"This
is
my
birthright!
The
same
birthright
of
the
Solomons
who
came
before
me!
I
can't
believe
you'd
try
to
trick
me
out
of
my
inheritance
with
lame
stories
about
ancient
treasure
maps!"
He
tucked
the
portfolio
under
his
arm
and
marched
past
Bellamy
to
the
study's
patio
door.
"Zachary,
wait!"
His
father
rushed
after
him
as
Zachary
stalked
out
into
the
night.
"Whatever
you
do,
you
can
never
speak
of
the
pyramid
you
have
seen!"
Peter
Solomon's
voice
cracked.
"Not
to
anyonel
Ever!"
But
Zachary
ignored
him,
disappearing
into
the
night.
Peter
Solomon's
gray
eyes
were
filled
with
pain
as
he
returned
to
his
desk
and
sat
heavily
in
his
leather
chair.
After
a
long
silence,
he
looked
up
at
Bellamy
and
forced
a
sad
smile.
"That
went
well."
Bellamy
sighed,
sharing
in
Solomon's
pain.
"Peter,
I
don't
mean
to
sound
insensitive
but
do
you
trust
him?"
Solomon
stared
blankly
into
space.
"I
mean"
Bellamy
pressed,
"not
to
say
anything
about
the
pyramid?"
Solomon's
face
was
blank.
"I
really
don't
know
what
to
say,
Warren.
I'm
not
sure
I
even
know
him
anymore."
Bellamy
rose
and
walked
slowly
back
and
forth
before
the
large
desk.
"Peter,
you
have
followed
your
family
duty,
but
now,
considering
what
just
happened,
I
think
we
need
to
take
precautions.
I
should
return
the
capstone
to
you
so
you
can
find
a
new
home
for
it.
Someone
else
should
watch
over
it."
"Why?"
Solomon
asked.
"If
Zachary
tells
anyone
about
the
pyramid
and
mentions
my
being
present
tonight"
"He
knows
nothing
of
the
capstone,
and
he's
too
immature
to
know
the
pyramid
has
any
significance.
We
don't
need
a
new
home
for
it.
I'll
keep
the
pyramid
in
my
vault.
And
you
will
keep
the
capstone
wherever
you
keep
it.
As
we
always
have."
It
was
six
years
later,
on
Christmas
Day,
with
the
family
still
healing
from
Zachary
's
death,
that
the
enormous
man
claiming
to
have
killed
him
in
prison
broke
into
the
Solomon
estate.
The
intruder
had
come
for
the
pyramid,
but
he
had
taken
with
him
only
Isabel
Solomon's
life.
Days
later,
Peter
summoned
Bellamy
to
his
office.
He
locked
the
door
and
took
the
pyramid
out
of
his
vault,
setting
it
on
the
desk
between
them.
"I
should
have
listened
to
you."
Bellamy
knew
Peter
was
racked
with
guilt
over
this.
"It
wouldn't
have
mattered."
Solomon
drew
a
tired
breath.
"Did
you
bring
the
capstone?"
Bellamy
pulled
a
small
cube-shaped
package
from
his
pocket.
The
faded
brown
paper
was
tied
with
twine
and
bore
a
wax
seal
of
Solomon's
ring.
Bellamy
laid
the
package
on
the
desk,
knowing
the
two
halves
of
the
Masonic
Pyramid
were
closer
together
tonight
than
they
should
be.
"Find
someone
else
to
watch
this.
Don't
tell
me
who
it
is."
Solomon
nodded.
"And
I
know
where
you
can
hide
the
pyramid,"
Bellamy
said.
He
told
Solomon
about
the
Capitol
Building
subbasement.
"There's
no
place
in
Washington
more
secure."
Bellamy
recalled
Solomon
liking
the
idea
right
away
because
it
felt
symbolically
apt
to
hide
the
pyramid
in
the
symbolic
heart
of
our
nation.
Typical
Solomon,
Bellamy
had
thought.
The
idealist
even
in
a
crisis.
Now,
ten
years
later,
as
Bellamy
was
being
shoved
blindly
through
the
Library
of
Congress,
he
knew
the
crisis
tonight
was
far
from
over.
He
also
now
knew
whom
Solomon
had
chosen
to
guard
the
capstone
and
he
prayed
to
God
that
Robert
Langdon
was
up
to
the
job.
I'm
under
Second
Street.
Langdon'
s
eyes
remained
tightly
shut
as
the
conveyor
rumbled
through
the
darkness
toward
the
Adams
Building.
He
did
his
best
not
to
picture
the
tons
of
earth
overhead
and
the
narrow
tube
through
which
he
was
now
traveling.
He
could
hear
Katherine
breathing
several
yards
ahead
of
him,
but
so
far,
she
had
not
uttered
a
word.
She's
in
shock.
Langdon
was
not
looking
forward
to
telling
her
about
her
brother's
severed
hand.
You
have
to,
Robert.
She
needs
to
know.
"Katherine?"
Langdon
finally
said,
without
opening
his
eyes.
"Are
you
okay?"
A
tremulous,
disembodied
voice
replied
somewhere
up
ahead.
"Robert,
the
pyramid
you're
carrying.
It's
Peter's,
isn't
it?"
"Yes,"
Langdon
replied.
A
long
silence
followed.
"I
think
that
pyramid
is
why
my
mother
was
murdered."
Langdon
was
well
aware
that
Isabel
Solomon
had
been
murdered
ten
years
ago,
but
he
didn't
know
the
details,
and
Peter
had
never
mentioned
anything
about
a
pyramid.
"What
are
you
talking
about?"
Katherine'
s
voice
filled
with
emotion
as
she
recounted
the
harrowing
events
of
that
night,
how
the
tattooed
man
had
broken
into
their
estate.
"It
was
a
long
time
ago,
but
I'll
never
forget
that
he
demanded
a
pyramid.
He
said
he
heard
about
the
pyramid
in
prison,
from
my
nephew,
Zachary
right
before
he
killed
him."
Langdon
listened
in
amazement.
The
tragedy
within
the
Solomon
family
was
almost
beyond
belief.
Katherine
continued,
telling
Langdon
that
she
had
always
believed
the
intruder
was
killed
that
night
that
is,
until
this
same
man
had
resurfaced
today,
posing
as
Peter's
psychiatrist
and
luring
Katherine
to
his
home.
"He
knew
private
things
about
my
brother,
my
mother's
death,
and
even
my
work,"
she
said
anxiously,
"things
he
could
only
have
learned
from
my
brother.
And
so
I
trusted
him
and
that's
how
he
got
inside
the
Smithsonian
Museum
Support
Center."
Katherine
took
a
deep
breath
and
told
Langdon
she
was
nearly
certain
the
man
had
destroyed
her
lab
tonight.
Langdon
listened
in
utter
shock.
For
several
moments,
the
two
of
them
lay
together
in
silence
on
the
moving
conveyor.
Langdon
knew
he
had
an
obligation
to
share
with
Katherine
the
rest
of
tonight's
terrible
news.
He
began
slowly,
and
as
gently
as
he
possibly
could
he
told
her
how
her
brother
had
entrusted
him
with
a
small
package
years
earlier,
how
Langdon
had
been
tricked
into
bringing
this
package
to
Washington
tonight,
and
finally,
about
her
brother's
hand
having
been
found
in
the
Rotunda
of
the
Capitol
Building.
Katherine
's
reaction
was
deafening
silence.
Langdon
could
tell
she
was
reeling,
and
he
wished
he
could
reach
out
and
comfort
her,
but
lying
end
to
end
in
the
narrow
blackness
made
it
impossible.
"Peter's
okay,"
he
whispered.
"He's
alive,
and
we'll
get
him
back."
Langdon
tried
to
give
her
hope.
"Katherine,
his
captor
promised
me
your
brother
would
be
returned
alive
as
long
as
I
decipher
the
pyramid
for
him."
Still
Katherine
said
nothing.
Langdon
kept
talking.
He
told
her
about
the
stone
pyramid,
its
Masonic
cipher,
the
sealed
capstone,
and,
of
course,
about
Bellamy's
claims
that
this
pyramid
was
in
fact
the
Masonic
Pyramid
of
legend
a
map
that
revealed
the
hiding
place
of
a
long
spiral
staircase
that
led
deep
into
the
earth
down
hundreds
of
feet
to
a
mystical
ancient
treasure
that
had
been
buried
in
Washington
long
ago.
Katherine
finally
spoke,
but
her
voice
was
flat
and
emotionless.
"Robert,
open
your
eyes."
Open
my
eyes?
Langdon
had
no
desire
to
have
even
the
slightest
glimpse
of
how
cramped
this
space
really
was.
"Robert!"
Katherine
demanded,
urgently
now.
"Open
your
eyes!
We're
here!"
Langdon'
s
eyes
flew
open
as
his
body
emerged
through
an
opening
similar
to
the
one
it
had
entered
at
the
other
end.
Katherine
was
already
climbing
off
the
conveyor
belt.
She
lifted
his
daybag
off
the
belt
as
Langdon
swung
his
legs
over
the
edge
and
jumped
down
onto
the
tile
floor
just
in
time,
before
the
conveyor
turned
the
corner
and
headed
back
the
way
it
came.
The
space
around
them
was
a
circulation
room
much
like
the
one
they
had
come
from
in
the
other
building.
A
small
sign
read
ADAMS
BUILDING:
CIRCULATION
ROOM
3.
Langdon
felt
like
he
had
just
emerged
from
some
kind
of
subterranean
birth
canal.
Born
again.
He
turned
immediately
to
Katherine.
"Are
you
okay?"
Her
eyes
were
red,
and
she
had
obviously
been
crying,
but
she
nodded
with
a
resolute
stoicism.
She
picked
up
Langdon'
s
daybag
and
carried
it
across
the
room
without
a
word,
setting
it
on
a
cluttered
desk.
She
lit
the
desk's
halogen
clamp
lamp,
unzipped
the
bag,
folded
down
the
sides,
and
peered
inside.
The
granite
pyramid
looked
almost
austere
in
the
clean
halogen
light.
Katherine
ran
her
fingers
over
the
engraved
Masonic
cipher,
and
Langdon
sensed
deep
emotion
churning
within
her.
Slowly,
she
reached
into
the
daybag
and
pulled
out
the
cube-shaped
package.
She
held
it
under
the
light,
examining
it
closely.
"As
you
can
see,"
Langdon
quietly
said,
"the
wax
seal
is
embossed
with
Peter's
Masonic
ring.
He
said
this
ring
was
used
to
seal
the
package
more
than
a
century
ago."
Katherine
said
nothing.
"When
your
brother
entrusted
the
package
to
me,"
Langdon
told
her,
"he
said
it
would
give
me
the
power
to
create
order
out
of
chaos.
I'm
not
entirely
sure
what
that
means,
but
I've
got
to
assume
the
capstone
reveals
something
important,
because
Peter
was
insistent
that
it
not
fall
into
the
wrong
hands.
Mr.
Bellamy
just
told
me
the
same
thing,
urging
me
to
hide
the
pyramid
and
not
let
anyone
open
the
package."
Katherine
turned
now,
looking
angry.
"Bellamy
told
you
not
to
open
the
package?"
"Yes.
He
was
adamant."
Katherine
looked
incredulous.
"But
you
said
this
capstone
is
the
only
way
we
can
decipher
the
pyramid,
right?"
"Probably,
yes."
Katherine'
s
voice
was
rising
now.
"And
you
said
deciphering
the
pyramid
is
what
you
were
told
to
do.
It's
the
only
way
we
can
get
Peter
back,
right?"
Langdon
nodded.
"Then,
Robert,
why
wouldn't
we
open
the
package
and
decipher
this
thing
right
now?!"
Langdon
didn't
know
how
to
respond.
"Katherine,
I
had
the
same
exact
reaction,
and
yet
Bellamy
told
me
that
keeping
this
pyramid's
secret
intact
was
more
important
than
anything
including
your
brother's
life."
Katherine
's
pretty
features
hardened,
and
she
tucked
a
wisp
of
hair
behind
her
ears.
When
she
spoke,
her
voice
was
resolved.
"This
stone
pyramid,
whatever
it
is,
has
cost
me
my
entire
family.
First
my
nephew,
Zachary,
then
my
mother,
and
now
my
brother.And
let's
face
it,
Robert,
if
you
hadn't
called
tonight
to
warn
me"
Langdon
could
feel
himself
trapped
between
Katherine'
s
logic
and
Bellamy's
steadfast
urging.
"I
may
be
a
scientist,"
she
said,
"but
I
also
come
from
a
family
of
well-known
Masons.
Believe
me,
I've
heard
all
the
stories
about
the
Masonic
Pyramid
and
its
promise
of
some
great
treasure
that
will
enlighten
mankind.
Honestly,
I
find
it
hard
to
imagine
such
a
thing
exists.
However,
if
it
does
exist
perhaps
it's
time
to
unveil
it."
Katherine
slid
a
finger
beneath
the
old
twine
on
the
package.
Langdon
jumped.
"Katherine,
no!
Wait!"
She
paused,
but
her
finger
remained
beneath
the
string.
"Robert,
I'm
not
going
to
let
my
brother
die
for
this.
Whatever
this
capstone
says
whatever
lost
treasures
this
engraving
might
reveal
those
secrets
end
tonight."
With
that,
Katherine
yanked
defiantly
on
the
twine,
and
the
brittle
wax
seal
exploded.
In
a
quiet
neighborhood
just
west
of
Embassy
Row
in
Washington,
there
exists
a
medieval-
style
walled
garden
whose
roses,
it
is
said,
spring
from
twelfth-century
plants.
The
garden's
Carderock
gazebo
known
as
Shadow
House
sits
elegantly
amid
meandering
pathways
of
stones
dug
from
George
Washington's
private
quarry.
Tonight
the
silence
of
the
gardens
was
broken
by
a
young
man
who
rushed
through
the
wooden
gate,
shouting
as
he
came.
"Hello?"
he
called
out,
straining
to
see
in
the
moonlight.
"Are
you
in
here?"
The
voice
that
replied
was
frail,
barely
audible.
"In
the
gazebo
just
taking
some
air."
The
young
man
found
his
withered
superior
seated
on
the
stone
bench
beneath
a
blanket.
The
hunched
old
man
was
tiny,
with
elfin
features.
The
years
had
bent
him
in
two
and
stolen
his
eyesight,
but
his
soul
remained
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with.
Catching
his
breath,
the
young
man
told
him,
"I
just
took
a
call
from
your
friend
Warren
Bellamy."
"Oh?"
The
old
man
perked
up.
"About
what?"
"He
didn't
say,
but
he
sounded
like
he
was
in
a
big
hurry.
He
told
me
he
left
you
a
message
on
your
voice
mail,
which
you
need
to
listen
to
right
away."
"That's
all
he
said?"
"Not
quite."
The
young
man
paused.
"He
told
me
to
ask
you
a
question."
A
very
strange
question.
"He
said
he
needed
your
response
right
away."
The
old
man
leaned
closer.
"What
question?"
As
the
young
man
spoke
Mr.
Bellamy's
question,
the
pall
that
crossed
the
old
man's
face
was
visible
even
in
the
moonlight.
Immediately,
he
threw
off
his
blanket
and
began
struggling
to
his
feet.
"Please
help
me
inside.
Right
away."
No
more
secrets,
thought
Katherine
Solomon.
On
the
table
in
front
of
her,
the
wax
seal
that
had
been
intact
for
generations
now
lay
in
pieces.
She
finished
removing
the
faded
brown
paper
from
her
brother's
precious
package.
Beside
her,
Langdon
looked
decidedly
uneasy.
From
within
the
paper,
Katherine
extracted
a
small
box
made
of
gray
stone.
Resembling
a
polished
granite
cube,
the
box
had
no
hinges,
no
latch,
and
no
apparent
way
inside.
It
reminded
Katherine
of
a
Chinese
puzzle
box.
"It
looks
like
a
solid
block,"
she
said,
running
her
fingers
over
the
edges.
"Are
you
sure
the
X-ray
showed
it
was
hollow?
With
a
capstone
inside?"
"It
did,"
Langdon
said,
moving
next
to
Katherine
and
scrutinizing
the
mysterious
box.
He
and
Katherine
peered
at
the
box
from
different
angles,
attempting
to
find
a
way
in.
"Got
it,"
Katherine
said
as
her
fingernail
located
the
hidden
slit
along
one
of
the
box's
top
edges.
She
set
the
box
down
on
the
desk
and
then
carefully
pried
open
the
lid,
which
rose
smoothly,
like
the
top
of
a
fine
jewelry
box.
When
the
lid
fell
back,
Langdon
and
Katherine
both
drew
audible
breaths.
The
interior
of
the
box
seemed
to
be
glowing.
The
inside
was
shining
with
an
almost
supernatural
effulgence.
Katherine
had
never
seen
a
piece
of
gold
this
large,
and
it
took
her
an
instant
to
realize
that
the
precious
metal
was
simply
reflecting
the
radiance
of
the
desk
lamp.
"It's
spectacular,"
she
whispered.
Despite
being
sealed
in
a
dark
stone
cube
for
over
a
century,
the
capstone
had
not
faded
or
tarnished
in
any
way.
Gold
resists
the
entropic
laws
of
decay;
that's
one
of
the
reasons
the
ancients
considered
it
magical.
Katherine
felt
her
pulse
quicken
as
she
leaned
forward,
peering
down
over
the
small
golden
point.
"There's
an
inscription."
Langdon
moved
closer,
their
shoulders
now
touching.
His
blue
eyes
flashed
with
curiosity.
He
had
told
Katherine
about
the
ancient
Greek
practice
of
creating
a
symbolon
a
code
broken
into
parts
and
how
this
capstone,
long
separated
from
the
pyramid
itself,
would
hold
the
key
to
deciphering
the
pyramid.
Allegedly,
this
inscription,
whatever
it
said,
would
bring
order
from
this
chaos.
Katherine
held
the
little
box
up
to
the
light
and
peered
straight
down
over
the
capstone.
Though
small,
the
inscription
was
perfectly
visible
a
small
bit
of
elegantly
engraved
text
on
the
face
of
one
side.
Katherine
read
the
six
simple
words.
Then
she
read
them
again.
"No!she
declared.
"That
can
't
be
what
it
says
!"
Across
the
street,
Director
Sato
hurried
up
the
long
walkway
outside
the
Capitol
Building
toward
her
rendezvous
point
on
First
Street.
The
update
from
her
field
team
had
been
unacceptable.
No
Langdon.
No
pyramid.
No
capstone.
Bellamy
was
in
custody,
but
he
was
not
telling
them
the
truth.
At
least
not
yet.
I'll
make
him
talk.
She
glanced
back
over
her
shoulder
at
one
of
Washington's
newest
vistas
the
Capitol
Dome
framed
above
the
new
visitor
center.
The
illuminated
dome
only
accentuated
the
significance
of
what
was
truly
at
stake
tonight.
Dangerous
times.
Sato
was
relieved
to
hear
her
cell
phone
ring
and
see
her
analyst's
ID
on
the
screen.
"Nola,"
Sato
answered.
"What
have
you
got?"
Nola
Kaye
gave
her
the
bad
news.
The
X-ray
of
the
capstone's
inscription
was
too
faint
to
read,
and
the
image-enhancing
filters
had
not
helped.
Shit.
Sato
chewed
at
her
lip.
"How
about
the
sixteen-letter
grid?"
"I'm
still
trying,"
Nola
said,
"but
so
far
I've
found
no
secondary
encryption
scheme
that's
applicable.
I've
got
a
computer
reshuffling
the
letters
in
the
grid
and
looking
for
anything
identifiable,
but
there
are
over
twenty
trillion
possibilities."
"Stay
on
it.
Let
me
know."
Sato
hung
up,
scowling.
Her
hopes
of
deciphering
the
pyramid
using
only
a
photograph
and
X-ray
were
fading
fast.
/
need
that
pyramid
and
capstone
and
I'm
running
out
of
time.
Sato
arrived
at
First
Street
just
as
a
black
Escalade
SUV
with
dark
windows
roared
across
the
double
yellow
and
skidded
to
a
stop
in
front
of
her
at
their
rendezvous
point.
A
lone
agent
got
out.
"Any
word
yet
on
Langdon?"
Sato
demanded.
"Confidence
is
high,"
the
man
said,
emotionless.
"Backup
just
arrived.
All
library
exits
are
surrounded.
We
even
have
air
support
coming
in.
We'll
flush
him
with
tear
gas,
and
he'll
have
nowhere
to
run."
"And
Bellamy?"
"Tied
up
in
the
backseat."
Good.
Her
shoulder
was
still
smarting.
The
agent
handed
Sato
a
plastic
Ziploc
bag
containing
cell
phone,
keys,
and
wallet.
"Bellamy's
effects."
"Nothing
else?"
"No,
ma'am.
The
pyramid
and
package
must
still
be
with
Langdon."
"Okay,"
Sato
said.
"Bellamy
knows
plenty
he's
not
telling.
I'd
like
to
question
him
personally."
"Yes,
ma'am.
To
Langley,
then?"
Sato
took
a
deep
breath
and
paced
a
moment
beside
the
SUV.
Strict
protocols
governed
the
interrogation
of
U.S.
civilians,
and
questioning
Bellamy
was
highly
illegal
unless
it
was
done
at
Langley
on
video
with
witnesses,
attorneys,
blah,
blah,
blah
"Not
Langley,"
she
said,
trying
to
think
of
somewhere
closer.
And
more
private.
The
agent
said
nothing,
standing
at
attention
beside
the
idling
SUV,
waiting
for
orders.
Sato
lit
a
cigarette,
took
a
long
drag,
and
gazed
down
at
the
Ziploc
bag
of
Bellamy's
items.
His
key
ring,
she
had
noticed,
included
an
electronic
fob
adorned
with
four
letters
USBG.
Sato
knew,
of
course,
which
government
building
this
fob
accessed.
The
building
was
very
close
and,
at
this
hour,
very
private.
She
smiled
and
pocketed
the
fob.
Perfect.
When
she
told
the
agent
where
she
wanted
to
take
Bellamy,
she
expected
the
man
to
look
surprised,
but
he
simply
nodded
and
opened
the
passenger
door
for
her,
his
cold
stare
revealing
nothing.
Sato
loved
professionals.
Langdon
stood
in
the
basement
of
the
Adams
Building
and
stared
in
disbelief
at
the
elegantly
inscribed
words
on
the
face
of
the
golden
capstone.
That's
all
it
says?
Beside
him,
Katherine
held
the
capstone
under
the
light
and
shook
her
head.
"There's
got
to
be
more,"
she
insisted,
sounding
cheated.
"This
is
what
my
brother
has
been
protecting
all
these
years?"
Langdon
had
to
admit
he
was
mystified.
According
to
Peter
and
Bellamy,
this
capstone
was
supposed
to
help
them
decipher
the
stone
pyramid.
In
light
of
those
claims,
Langdon
had
expected
something
illuminating
and
helpful.
More
like
obvious
and
useless.
Once
again,
he
read
the
six
words
delicately
inscribed
on
the
face
of
the
capstone.
The
secret
hides
within
The
Order
The
secret
hides
within
The
Order?
At
first
glance,
the
inscription
appeared
to
be
stating
the
obvious
that
the
letters
on
the
pyramid
were
out
of
"order"
and
that
their
secret
lay
in
finding
their
proper
sequence.
This
reading,
however,
in
addition
to
being
self-evident,
seemed
unlikely
for
another
reason.
"The
words
the
and
order
are
capitalized,"
Langdon
said.
Katherine
nodded
blankly.
"I
saw
that."
The
secret
hides
within
The
Order.
Langdon
could
think
of
only
one
logical
implication.'The
Order'
must
be
referencing
the
