at
the
Royal
Holloway."
"So
then,
that
explains
it."
Teabing
hobbled
lower
through
the
shadows.
"Perhaps
Robert
told
you
I
schooled
just
down
the
road
at
Oxford."
Teabing
fixed
Langdon
with
a
devilish
smile.
"Of
course,
I
also
applied
to
Harvard
as
my
safety
school."
Their
host
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs,
appearing
to
Sophie
no
more
like
a
knight
than
Sir
Elton
John.
Portly
and
ruby
faced,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
had
bushy
red
hair
and
jovial
hazel
eyes
that
seemed
to
twinkle
as
he
spoke.
He
wore
pleated
pants
and
a
roomy
silk
shirt
under
a
paisley
vest.
Despite
the
aluminum
braces
on
his
legs,
he
carried
himself
with
a
resilient,
vertical
dignity
that
seemed
more
a
by
product
of
noble
ancestry
than
any
kind
of
conscious
effort.
Teabing
arrived
and
extended
a
hand
to
Langdon.
"Robert,
you've
lost
weight."
Langdon
grinned.
"And
you've
found
some."
Teabing
laughed
heartily,
patting
his
rotund
belly.
"Touche.
My
only
carnal
pleasures
these
days
seem
to
be
culinary.
"
Turning
now
to
Sophie,
he
gently
took
her
hand,
bowing
his
head
slightly,
breathing
lightly
on
her
fingers,
and
diverting
his
eyes.
"M'lady."
Sophie
glanced
at
Langdon,
uncertain
whether
she'd
stepped
back
in
time
or
into
a
nuthouse.
The
butler
who
had
answered
the
door
now
entered
carrying
a
tea
service,
which
he
arranged
on
a
table
in
front
of
the
fireplace.
"This
is
Remy
Legaludec,"
Teabing
said,
"my
manservant."
The
slender
butler
gave
a
stiff
nod
and
disappeared
yet
again.
"Remy
is
Lyonais,
"
Teabing
whispered,
as
if
it
were
an
unfortunate
disease.
"But
he
does
sauces
quite
nicely."
Langdon
looked
amused.
"I
would
have
thought
you'd
import
an
English
staff?"
"Good
heavens,
no!
I
would
not
wish
a
British
chef
on
anyone
except
the
French
tax
collectors."
He
glanced
over
at
Sophie.
"Pardonnez
moi,
Mademoiselle
Neveu.
Please
be
assured
that
my
distaste
for
the
French
extends
only
to
politics
and
the
soccer
pitch.
Your
government
steals
my
money,
and
your
football
squad
recently
humiliated
us."
Sophie
offered
an
easy
smile.
Teabing
eyed
her
a
moment
and
then
looked
at
Langdon.
"Something
has
happened.
You
both
look
shaken.
Langdon
nodded.
"We've
had
an
interesting
night,
Leigh."
"No
doubt.
You
arrive
on
my
doorstep
unannounced
in
the
middle
of
the
night
speaking
of
the
Grail.
Tell
me,
is
this
indeed
about
the
Grail,
or
did
you
simply
say
that
because
you
know
it
is
the
lone
topic
for
which
I
would
rouse
myself
in
the
middle
of
the
night?"
A
little
of
both,
Sophie
thought,
picturing
the
cryptex
hidden
beneath
the
couch.
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
"we'd
like
to
talk
to
you
about
the
Priory
of
Sion."
Teabing's
bushy
eyebrows
arched
with
intrigue.
"The
keepers.
So
this
is
indeed
about
the
Grail.
You
say
you
come
with
information?
Something
new,
Robert?"
"Perhaps.
We're
not
quite
sure.
We
might
have
a
better
idea
if
we
could
get
some
information
from
you
first."
Teabing
wagged
his
finger.
"Ever
the
wily
American.
A
game
of
quid
pro
quo.
Very
well.
I
am
at
your
service.
What
is
it
I
can
tell
you?"
Langdon
sighed.
"I
was
hoping
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
explain
to
Ms.
Neveu
the
true
nature
of
the
Holy
Grail."
Teabing
looked
stunned.
"She
doesn't
know?"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
The
smile
that
grew
on
Teabing's
face
was
almost
obscene.
"Robert,
you've
brought
me
a
virgin?"
Langdon
winced,
glancing
at
Sophie.
"Virgin
is
the
term
Grail
enthusiasts
use
to
describe
anyone
who
has
never
heard
the
true
Grail
story."
Teabing
turned
eagerly
to
Sophie.
"How
much
do
you
know,
my
dear?"
Sophie
quickly
outlined
what
Langdon
had
explained
earlier
the
Priory
of
Sion,
the
Knights
Templar,
the
Sangreal
documents,
and
the
Holy
Grail,
which
many
claimed
was
not
a
cup
but
rather
something
far
more
powerful.
"That's
all?"
Teabing
fired
Langdon
a
scandalous
look.
"Robert,
I
thought
you
were
a
gentleman.
You've
robbed
her
of
the
climax!"
"I
know,
I
thought
perhaps
you
and
I
could"
Langdon
apparently
decided
the
unseemly
metaphor
had
gone
far
enough.
Teabing
already
had
Sophie
locked
in
his
twinkling
gaze.
"You
are
a
Grail
virgin,
my
dear.
And
trust
me,
you
will
never
forget
your
first
time."
Seated
on
the
divan
beside
Langdon,
Sophie
drank
her
tea
and
ate
a
scone,
feeling
the
welcome
effects
of
caffeine
and
food.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
was
beaming
as
he
awkwardly
paced
before
the
open
fire,
his
leg
braces
clicking
on
the
stone
hearth.
"The
Holy
Grail,"
Teabing
said,
his
voice
sermonic.
"Most
people
ask
me
only
where
it
is.
I
fear
that
is
a
question
I
may
never
answer."
He
turned
and
looked
directly
at
Sophie.
"However
the
far
more
relevant
question
is
this:
What
is
the
Holy
Grail?"
Sophie
sensed
a
rising
air
of
academic
anticipation
now
in
both
of
her
male
companions.
"To
fully
understand
the
Grail,"
Teabing
continued,
"we
must
first
understand
the
Bible.
How
well
do
you
know
the
New
Testament?"
Sophie
shrugged.
"Not
at
all,
really.
I
was
raised
by
a
man
who
worshipped
Leonardo
da
Vinci."
Teabing
looked
both
startled
and
pleased.
"An
enlightened
soul.
Superb!
Then
you
must
be
aware
that
Leonardo
was
one
of
the
keepers
of
the
secret
of
the
Holy
Grail.
And
he
hid
clues
in
his
art."
"Robert
told
me
as
much,
yes."
"And
Da
Vinci's
views
on
the
New
Testament?"
"I
have
no
idea."
Teabing's
eyes
turned
mirthful
as
he
motioned
to
the
bookshelf
across
the
room.
"Robert,
would
you
mind?
On
the
bottom
shelf.
La
Storia
di
Leonardo.
Langdon
went
across
the
room,
found
a
large
art
book,
and
brought
it
back,
setting
it
down
on
the
table
between
them.
Twisting
the
book
to
face
Sophie,
Teabing
flipped
open
the
heavy
cover
and
pointed
inside
the
rear
cover
to
a
series
of
quotations.
"From
Da
Vinci's
notebook
on
polemics
and
speculation,"
Teabing
said,
indicating
one
quote
in
particular.
"I
think
you'll
find
this
relevant
to
our
discussion."
Sophie
read
the
words.
Many
have
made
a
trade
of
delusions
and
false
miracles,
deceiving
the
stupid
multitude.
LEONARDO
DA
VINCI
"Here's
another,"
Teabing
said,
pointing
to
a
different
quote.
Blinding
ignorance
does
mislead
us.
01
Wretched
mortals,
open
your
eyes!
LEONARDO
DA
VINCI
Sophie
felt
a
little
chill.
"Da
Vinci
is
talking
about
the
Bible?"
Teabing
nodded.
"Leonardo's
feelings
about
the
Bible
relate
directly
to
the
Holy
Grail.
In
fact,
Da
Vinci
painted
the
true
Grail,
which
I
will
show
you
momentarily,
but
first
we
must
speak
of
the
Bible."
Teabing
smiled.
"And
everything
you
need
to
know
about
the
Bible
can
be
summed
up
by
the
great
canon
doctor
Martyn
Percy."
Teabing
cleared
his
throat
and
declared,
"The
Bible
did
not
arrive
by
fax
from
heaven."
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"The
Bible
is
a
product
of
man,
my
dear.
Not
of
God.
The
Bible
did
not
fall
magically
from
the
clouds.
Man
created
it
as
a
historical
record
of
tumultuous
times,
and
it
has
evolved
through
countless
translations,
additions,
and
revisions.
History
has
never
had
a
definitive
version
of
the
book."
"Okay."
"Jesus
Christ
was
a
historical
figure
of
staggering
influence,
perhaps
the
most
enigmatic
and
inspirational
leader
the
world
has
ever
seen.
As
the
prophesied
Messiah,
Jesus
toppled
kings,
inspired
millions,
and
founded
new
philosophies.
As
a
descendant
of
the
lines
of
King
Solomon
and
King
David,
Jesus
possessed
a
rightful
claim
to
the
throne
of
the
King
of
the
Jews.
Understandably,
His
life
was
recorded
by
thousands
of
followers
across
the
land."
Teabing
paused
to
sip
his
tea
and
then
placed
the
cup
back
on
the
mantel.
"More
than
eighty
gospels
were
considered
for
the
New
Testament,
and
yet
only
a
relative
few
were
chosen
for
inclusion
Matthew,
Mark,
Luke,
and
John
among
them.
"Who
chose
which
gospels
to
include?"
Sophie
asked.
"Aha!"
Teabing
burst
in
with
enthusiasm.
"The
fundamental
irony
of
Christianity!
The
Bible,
as
we
know
it
today,
was
collated
by
the
pagan
Roman
emperor
Constantine
the
Great."
"I
thought
Constantine
was
a
Christian,"
Sophie
said.
"Hardly,"
Teabing
scoffed.
"He
was
a
lifelong
pagan
who
was
baptized
on
his
deathbed,
too
weak
to
protest.
In
Constantine's
day,
Rome's
official
religion
was
sun
worship
the
cult
of
Sol
Invictus,
or
the
Invincible
Sun
and
Constantine
was
its
head
priest.
Unfortunately
for
him,
a
growing
religious
turmoil
was
gripping
Rome.
Three
centuries
after
the
crucifixion
of
Jesus
Christ,
Christ's
followers
had
multiplied
exponentially.
Christians
and
pagans
began
warring,
and
the
conflict
grew
to
such
proportions
that
it
threatened
to
rend
Rome
in
two.
Constantine
decided
something
had
to
be
done.
In
325
A.D.,
he
decided
to
unify
Rome
under
a
single
religion.
Christianity."
Sophie
was
surprised.
"Why
would
a
pagan
emperor
choose
Christianity
as
the
official
religion?"
Teabing
chuckled.
"Constantine
was
a
very
good
businessman.
He
could
see
that
Christianity
was
on
the
rise,
and
he
simply
backed
the
winning
horse.
Historians
still
marvel
at
the
brilliance
with
which
Constantine
converted
the
sun
worshipping
pagans
to
Christianity.
By
fusing
pagan
symbols,
dates,
and
rituals
into
the
growing
Christian
tradition,
he
created
a
kind
of
hybrid
religion
that
was
acceptable
to
both
parties."
"Transmogrification,"
Langdon
said.
"The
vestiges
of
pagan
religion
in
Christian
symbology
are
undeniable.
Egyptian
sun
disks
became
the
halos
of
Catholic
saints.
Pictograms
of
Isis
nursing
her
miraculously
conceived
son
Horus
became
the
blueprint
for
our
modern
images
of
the
Virgin
Mary
nursing
Baby
Jesus.
And
virtually
all
the
elements
of
the
Catholic
ritual
the
miter,
the
altar,
the
doxology,
and
communion,
the
act
of
"God
eating"
were
taken
directly
from
earlier
pagan
mystery
religions."
Teabing
groaned.
"Don't
get
a
symbologist
started
on
Christian
icons.
Nothing
in
Christianity
is
original.
The
pre
Christian
God
Mithras
called
the
Son
of
God
and
the
Light
of
the
World
was
born
on
December
25,
died,
was
buried
in
a
rock
tomb,
and
then
resurrected
in
three
days.
By
the
way,
December
25
is
also
the
birthday
of
Osiris,
Adonis,
and
Dionysus.
The
newborn
Krishna
was
presented
with
gold,
frankincense,
and
myrrh.
Even
Christianity's
weekly
holy
day
was
stolen
from
the
pagans."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"Originally,"
Langdon
said,
"Christianity
honored
the
Jewish
Sabbath
of
Saturday,
but
Constantine
shifted
it
to
coincide
with
the
pagan's
veneration
day
of
the
sun."
He
paused,
grinning.
"To
this
day,
most
churchgoers
attend
services
on
Sunday
morning
with
no
idea
that
they
are
there
on
account
of
the
pagan
sun
god's
weekly
tribute
Sunday."
Sophie's
head
was
spinning.
"And
all
of
this
relates
to
the
Grail?"
"Indeed,"
Teabing
said.
"Stay
with
me.
During
this
fusion
of
religions,
Constantine
needed
to
strengthen
the
new
Christian
tradition,
and
held
a
famous
ecumenical
gathering
known
as
the
Council
of
Nicaea."
Sophie
had
heard
of
it
only
insofar
as
its
being
the
birthplace
of
the
Nicene
Creed.
"At
this
gathering,"
Teabing
said,
"many
aspects
of
Christianity
were
debated
and
voted
upon
the
date
of
Easter,
the
role
of
the
bishops,
the
administration
of
sacraments,
and,
of
course,
the
divinity
of
Jesus."
"I
don't
follow.
His
divinity?"
"My
dear,"
Teabing
declared,
"until
that
moment
in
history,
Jesus
was
viewed
by
His
followers
as
a
mortal
prophet
a
great
and
powerful
man,
but
a
man
nonetheless.
A
mortal."
"Not
the
Son
of
God?"
"Right,"
Teabing
said.
"Jesus'
establishment
as
'the
Son
of
God'
was
officially
proposed
and
voted
on
by
the
Council
of
Nicaea.
"Hold
on.
You're
saying
Jesus'
divinity
was
the
result
of
a
vote?"
"A
relatively
close
vote
at
that,"
Teabing
added.
"Nonetheless,
establishing
Christ's
divinity
was
critical
to
the
further
unification
of
the
Roman
empire
and
to
the
new
Vatican
power
base.
By
officially
endorsing
Jesus
as
the
Son
of
God,
Constantine
turned
Jesus
into
a
deity
who
existed
beyond
the
scope
of
the
human
world,
an
entity
whose
power
was
unchallengeable.
This
not
only
precluded
further
pagan
challenges
to
Christianity,
but
now
the
followers
of
Christ
were
able
to
redeem
themselves
only
via
the
established
sacred
channel
the
Roman
Catholic
Church.
Sophie
glanced
at
Langdon,
and
he
gave
her
a
soft
nod
of
concurrence.
"It
was
all
about
power,"
Teabing
continued.
"Christ
as
Messiah
was
critical
to
the
functioning
of
Church
and
state.
Many
scholars
claim
that
the
early
Church
literally
stole
Jesus
from
His
original
followers,
hijacking
His
human
message,
shrouding
it
in
an
impenetrable
cloak
of
divinity,
and
using
it
to
expand
their
own
power.
I've
written
several
books
on
the
topic."
"And
I
assume
devout
Christians
send
you
hate
mail
on
a
daily
basis?"
"Why
would
they?"
Teabing
countered.
"The
vast
majority
of
educated
Christians
know
the
history
of
their
faith.
Jesus
was
indeed
a
great
and
powerful
man.
Constantine's
underhanded
political
maneuvers
don't
diminish
the
majesty
of
Christ's
life.
Nobody
is
saying
Christ
was
a
fraud,
or
denying
that
He
walked
the
earth
and
inspired
millions
to
better
lives.
All
we
are
saying
is
that
Constantine
took
advantage
of
Christ's
substantial
influence
and
importance.
And
in
doing
so,
he
shaped
the
face
of
Christianity
as
we
know
it
today."
Sophie
glanced
at
the
art
book
before
her,
eager
to
move
on
and
see
the
Da
Vinci
painting
of
the
Holy
Grail.
"The
twist
is
this,"
Teabing
said,
talking
faster
now.
"Because
Constantine
upgraded
Jesus'
status
almost
four
centuries
after
Jesus'
death,
thousands
of
documents
already
existed
chronicling
His
life
as
a
mortal
man.
To
rewrite
the
history
books,
Constantine
knew
he
would
need
a
bold
stroke.
From
this
sprang
the
most
profound
moment
in
Christian
history."
Teabing
paused,
eyeing
Sophie.
"Constantine
commissioned
and
financed
a
new
Bible,
which
omitted
those
gospels
that
spoke
of
Christ's
human
traits
and
embellished
those
gospels
that
made
Him
godlike.
The
earlier
gospels
were
outlawed,
gathered
up,
and
burned."
"An
interesting
note,"
Langdon
added.
"Anyone
who
chose
the
forbidden
gospels
over
Constantine's
version
was
deemed
a
heretic.
The
word
heretic
derives
from
that
moment
in
history.
The
Latin
word
haereticus
means
'choice.'
Those
who
'chose'
the
original
history
of
Christ
were
the
world's
first
heretics.
"Fortunately
for
historians,"
Teabing
said,
"some
of
the
gospels
that
Constantine
attempted
to
eradicate
managed
to
survive.
The
Dead
Sea
Scrolls
were
found
in
the
1950s
hidden
in
a
cave
near
Qumran
in
the
Judean
desert.
And,
of
course,
the
Coptic
Scrolls
in
1945
at
Nag
Hammadi.
In
addition
to
telling
the
true
Grail
story,
these
documents
speak
of
Christ's
ministry
in
very
human
terms.
Of
course,
the
Vatican,
in
keeping
with
their
tradition
of
misinformation,
tried
very
hard
to
suppress
the
release
of
these
scrolls.
And
why
wouldn't
they?
The
scrolls
highlight
glaring
historical
discrepancies
and
fabrications,
clearly
confirming
that
the
modern
Bible
was
compiled
and
edited
by
men
who
possessed
a
political
agenda
to
promote
the
divinity
of
the
man
Jesus
Christ
and
use
His
influence
to
solidify
their
own
power
base."
"And
yet,"
Langdon
countered,
"it's
important
to
remember
that
the
modern
Church's
desire
to
suppress
these
documents
comes
from
a
sincere
belief
in
their
established
view
of
Christ.
The
Vatican
is
made
up
of
deeply
pious
men
who
truly
believe
these
contrary
documents
could
only
be
false
testimony.
Teabing
chuckled
as
he
eased
himself
into
a
chair
opposite
Sophie.
"As
you
can
see,
our
professor
has
a
far
softer
heart
for
Rome
than
I
do.
Nonetheless,
he
is
correct
about
the
modern
clergy
believing
these
opposing
documents
are
false
testimony.
That's
understandable.
Constantine's
Bible
has
been
their
truth
for
ages.
Nobody
is
more
indoctrinated
than
the
indoctrinator.
"What
he
means,"
Langdon
said,
"is
that
we
worship
the
gods
of
our
fathers."
"What
I
mean,"
Teabing
countered,
"is
that
almost
everything
our
fathers
taught
us
about
Christ
is
false.
As
are
the
stories
about
the
Holy
Grail."
Sophie
looked
again
at
the
Da
Vinci
quote
before
her.
Blinding
ignorance
does
mislead
us.
01
Wretched
mortals,
open
your
eyes!
Teabing
reached
for
the
book
and
flipped
toward
the
center.
"And
finally,
before
I
show
you
Da
Vinci's
paintings
of
the
Holy
Grail,
I'd
like
you
to
take
a
quick
look
at
this."
He
opened
the
book
to
a
colorful
graphic
that
spanned
both
full
pages.
"I
assume
you
recognize
this
fresco?"
He's
kidding,
right?
Sophie
was
staring
at
the
most
famous
fresco
of
all
time
The
Last
Supper
Da
Vinci's
legendary
painting
from
the
wall
of
Santa
Maria
delle
Grazie
near
Milan.
The
decaying
fresco
portrayed
Jesus
and
His
disciples
at
the
moment
that
Jesus
announced
one
of
them
would
betray
Him.
"I
know
the
fresco,
yes."
"Then
perhaps
you
would
indulge
me
this
little
game?
Close
your
eyes
if
you
would."
Uncertain,
Sophie
closed
her
eyes.
"Where
is
Jesus
sitting?"
Teabing
asked.
"In
the
center."
"Good.
And
what
food
are
He
and
His
disciples
breaking
and
eating?"
"Bread."
Obviously.
"Superb.
And
what
drink?"
"Wine.
They
drank
wine."
"Great.
And
one
final
question.
How
many
wineglasses
are
on
the
table?"
Sophie
paused,
realizing
it
was
the
trick
question.
And
after
dinner,
Jesus
took
the
cup
of
wine,
sharing
it
with
His
disciples.
"One
cup,"
she
said.
"The
chalice."
The
Cup
of
Christ.
The
Holy
Grail.
"Jesus
passed
a
single
chalice
of
wine,
just
as
modern
Christians
do
at
communion."
Teabing
sighed.
"Open
your
eyes."
She
did.
Teabing
was
grinning
smugly.
Sophie
looked
down
at
the
painting,
seeing
to
her
astonishment
that
everyone
at
the
table
had
a
glass
of
wine,
including
Christ.
Thirteen
cups.
Moreover,
the
cups
were
tiny,
stemless,
and
made
of
glass.
There
was
no
chalice
in
the
painting.
No
Holy
Grail.
Teabing's
eyes
twinkled.
"A
bit
strange,
don't
you
think,
considering
that
both
the
Bible
and
our
standard
Grail
legend
celebrate
this
moment
as
the
definitive
arrival
of
the
Holy
Grail.
Oddly,
Da
Vinci
appears
to
have
forgotten
to
paint
the
Cup
of
Christ.
"Surely
art
scholars
must
have
noted
that."
"You
will
be
shocked
to
learn
what
anomalies
Da
Vinci
included
here
that
most
scholars
either
do
not
see
or
simply
choose
to
ignore.
This
fresco,
in
fact,
is
the
entire
key
to
the
Holy
Grail
mystery.
Da
Vinci
lays
it
all
out
in
the
open
in
The
Last
Supper"
Sophie
scanned
the
work
eagerly.
"Does
this
fresco
tell
us
what
the
Grail
really
is?"
"Not
what
it
is,"
Teabing
whispered.
"But
rather
who
it
is.
The
Holy
Grail
is
not
a
thing.
It
is,
in
fact
a.
person"
Sophie
stared
at
Teabing
a
long
moment
and
then
turned
to
Langdon.
"The
Holy
Grail
is
a
person?"
Langdon
nodded.
"A
woman,
in
fact."
From
the
blank
look
on
Sophie's
face,
Langdon
could
tell
they
had
already
lost
her.
He
recalled
having
a
similar
reaction
the
first
time
he
heard
the
statement.
It
was
not
until
he
understood
the
symbology
behind
the
Grail
that
the
feminine
connection
became
clear.
Teabing
apparently
had
a
similar
thought.
"Robert,
perhaps
this
is
the
moment
for
the
symbologist
to
clarify?"
He
went
to
a
nearby
end
table,
found
a
piece
of
paper,
and
laid
it
in
front
of
Langdon.
Langdon
pulled
a
pen
from
his
pocket.
"Sophie,
are
you
familiar
with
the
modern
icons
for
male
and
female?"
He
drew
the
common
male
symbol
c?
and
female
symbol
.
"Of
course,"
she
said.
"These,"
he
said
quietly,
"are
not
the
original
symbols
for
male
and
female.
Many
people
incorrectly
assume
the
male
symbol
is
derived
from
a
shield
and
spear,
while
the
female
symbol
represents
a
mirror
reflecting
beauty.
In
fact,
the
symbols
originated
as
ancient
astronomical
symbols
for
the
planet
god
Mars
and
planet
goddess
Venus.
The
original
symbols
are
far
simpler."
Langdon
drew
another
icon
on
the
paper.
"This
symbol
is
the
original
icon
for
male,
"
he
told
her.
"A
rudimentary
phallus."
"Quite
to
the
point,"
Sophie
said.
"As
it
were,"
Teabing
added.
Langdon
went
on.
"This
icon
is
formally
known
as
the
blade,
and
it
represents
aggression
and
manhood.
In
fact,
this
exact
phallus
symbol
is
still
used
today
on
modern
military
uniforms
to
denote
rank."
"Indeed."
Teabing
grinned.
"The
more
penises
you
have,
the
higher
your
rank.
Boys
will
be
boys."
Langdon
winced.
"Moving
on,
the
female
symbol,
as
you
might
imagine,
is
the
exact
opposite."
He
drew
another
symbol
on
the
page.
"This
is
called
the
chalice.
Sophie
glanced
up,
looking
surprised.
Langdon
could
see
she
had
made
the
connection.
"The
chalice,"
he
said,
"resembles
a
cup
or
vessel,
and
more
important,
it
resembles
the
shape
of
a
woman's
womb.
This
symbol
communicates
femininity,
womanhood,
and
fertility."
Langdon
looked
directly
at
her
now.
"Sophie,
legend
tells
us
the
Holy
Grail
is
a
chalice
a
cup.
But
the
Grail's
description
as
a
chalice
is
actually
an
allegory
to
protect
the
true
nature
of
the
Holy
Grail.
That
is
to
say,
the
legend
uses
the
chalice
as
a
metaphor
for
something
far
more
important."
"A
woman,"
Sophie
said.
"Exactly."
Langdon
smiled.
"The
Grail
is
literally
the
ancient
symbol
for
womanhood,
and
the
Holy
Grail
represents
the
sacred
feminine
and
the
goddess,
which
of
course
has
now
been
lost,
virtually
eliminated
by
the
Church.
The
power
of
the
female
and
her
ability
to
produce
life
was
once
very
sacred,
but
it
posed
a
threat
to
the
rise
of
the
predominantly
male
Church,
and
so
the
sacred
feminine
was
demonized
and
called
unclean.
It
was
man,
not
God,
who
created
the
concept
of
'original
sin,'
whereby
Eve
tasted
of
the
apple
and
caused
the
downfall
of
the
human
race.
Woman,
once
the
sacred
giver
of
life,
was
now
the
enemy."
"I
should
add,"
Teabing
chimed,
"that
this
concept
of
woman
as
life
bringer
was
the
foundation
of
ancient
religion.
Childbirth
was
mystical
and
powerful.
Sadly,
Christian
philosophy
decided
to
embezzle
the
female's
creative
power
by
ignoring
biological
truth
and
making
man
the
Creator.
Genesis
tells
us
that
Eve
was
created
from
Adam's
rib.
Woman
became
an
offshoot
of
man.
And
a
sinful
one
at
that.
Genesis
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
the
goddess."
"The
Grail,"
Langdon
said,
"is
symbolic
of
the
lost
goddess.
When
Christianity
came
along,
the
old
pagan
religions
did
not
die
easily.
Legends
of
chivalric
quests
for
the
lost
Grail
were
in
fact
stories
of
forbidden
quests
to
find
the
lost
sacred
feminine.
Knights
who
claimed
to
be
"searching
for
the
chalice"
were
speaking
in
code
as
a
way
to
protect
themselves
from
a
Church
that
had
subjugated
women,
banished
the
Goddess,
burned
nonbelievers,
and
forbidden
the
pagan
reverence
for
the
sacred
feminine."
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"I'm
sorry,
when
you
said
the
Holy
Grail
was
a
person,
I
thought
you
meant
it
was
an
actual
person."
"It
is,"
Langdon
said.
"And
not
just
any
person,"
Teabing
blurted,
clambering
excitedly
to
his
feet.
"A
woman
who
carried
with
her
a
secret
so
powerful
that,
if
revealed,
it
threatened
to
devastate
the
very
foundation
of
Christianity!"
Sophie
looked
overwhelmed.
"Is
this
woman
well
known
in
history?"
"Quite."
Teabing
collected
his
crutches
and
motioned
down
the
hall.
"And
if
we
adjourn
to
the
study,
my
friends,
it
would
be
my
honor
to
show
you
Da
Vinci's
painting
of
her."
Two
rooms
away,
in
the
kitchen,
manservant
Remy
Legaludec
stood
in
silence
before
a
television.
The
news
station
was
broadcasting
photos
of
a
man
and
woman
the
same
two
individuals
to
whom
Remy
had
just
served
tea.
Standing
at
the
roadblock
outside
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich,
Lieutenant
Collet
wondered
what
was
taking
Fache
so
long
to
come
up
with
the
search
warrant.
The
bankers
were
obviously
hiding
something.
They
claimed
Langdon
and
Neveu
had
arrived
earlier
and
were
turned
away
from
the
bank
because
they
did
not
have
proper
account
identification.
So
why
won't
they
let
us
inside
for
a
look?
Finally,
Collet's
cellular
phone
rang.
It
was
the
command
post
at
the
Louvre.
"Do
we
have
a
search
warrant
yet?"
Collet
demanded.
"Forget
about
the
bank,
Lieutenant,"
the
agent
told
him.
"We
just
got
a
tip.
We
have
the
exact
location
where
Langdon
and
Neveu
are
hiding."
Collet
sat
down
hard
on
the
hood
of
his
car.
"You're
kidding."
"I
have
an
address
in
the
suburbs.
Somewhere
near
Versailles."
"Does
Captain
Fache
know?"
"Not
yet.
He's
busy
on
an
important
call."
"I'm
on
my
way.
Have
him
call
as
soon
as
he's
free."
Collet
took
down
the
address
and
jumped
in
his
car.
As
he
peeled
away
from
the
bank,
Collet
realized
he
had
forgotten
to
ask
who
had
tipped
DCPJ
off
to
Langdon's
location.
Not
that
it
mattered.
Collet
had
been
blessed
with
a
chance
to
redeem
his
skepticism
and
earlier
blunders.
He
was
about
to
make
the
most
high
profile
arrest
of
his
career.
Collet
radioed
the
five
cars
accompanying
him.
"No
sirens,
men.
Langdon
can't
know
we're
coming."
Forty
kilometers
away,
a
black
Audi
pulled
off
a
rural
road
and
parked
in
the
shadows
on
the
edge
of
a
field.
Silas
got
out
and
peered
through
the
rungs
of
the
wrought
iron
fence
that
encircled
the
vast
compound
before
him.
He
gazed
up
the
long
moonlit
slope
to
the
chateau
in
the
distance.
The
downstairs
lights
were
all
ablaze.
Odd
for
this
hour,
Silas
thought,
smiling.
The
information
the
Teacher
had
given
him
was
obviously
accurate.
will
not
leave
this
house
without
the
keystone,
he
vowed.
will
not
fail
the
bishop
and
the
Teacher.
Checking
the
thirteen
round
clip
in
his
Heckler
Koch,
Silas
pushed
it
through
the
bars
and
let
it
fall
onto
the
mossy
ground
inside
the
compound.
Then,
gripping
the
top
of
the
fence,
he
heaved
himself
up
and
over,
dropping
to
the
ground
on
the
other
side.
Ignoring
the
slash
of
pain
from
his
cilice,
Silas
retrieved
his
gun
and
began
the
long
trek
up
the
grassy
slope.
Teabing's
"study"
was
like
no
study
Sophie
had
ever
seen.
Six
or
seven
times
larger
than
even
the
most
luxurious
of
office
spaces,
the
knight's
cabinet
de
travail
resembled
an
ungainly
hybrid
of
science
laboratory,
archival
library,
and
indoor
flea
market.
Lit
by
three
overhead
chandeliers,
the
boundless
tile
floor
was
dotted
with
clustered
islands
of
worktables
buried
beneath
books,
artwork,
artifacts,
and
a
surprising
amount
of
electronic
gear
computers,
projectors,
microscopes,
copy
machines,
and
flatbed
scanners.
"I
converted
the
ballroom,"
Teabing
said,
looking
sheepish
as
he
shuffled
into
the
room.
"I
have
little
occasion
to
dance.
Sophie
felt
as
if
the
entire
night
had
become
some
kind
of
twilight
zone
where
nothing
was
as
she
expected.
"This
is
all
for
your
work?"
"Learning
the
truth
has
become
my
life's
love,"
Teabing
said.
"And
the
Sangreal
is
my
favorite
mistress."
The
Holy
Grail
is
a
woman,
Sophie
thought,
her
mind
a
collage
of
interrelated
ideas
that
seemed
to
make
no
sense.
"You
said
you
have
a
picture
of
this
woman
who
you
claim
is
the
Holy
Grail."
"Yes,
but
it
is
not
I
who
claim
she
is
the
Grail.
Christ
Himself
made
that
claim."
"Which
one
is
the
painting?"
Sophie
asked,
scanning
the
walls.
"Hmmm"
Teabing
made
a
show
of
seeming
to
have
forgotten.
"The
Holy
Grail.
The
Sangreal.
The
Chalice."
He
wheeled
suddenly
and
pointed
to
the
far
wall.
On
it
hung
an
eight
foot
long
print
of
The
Last
Supper,
the
same
exact
image
Sophie
had
just
been
looking
at.
"There
she
is!"
Sophie
was
certain
she
had
missed
something.
"That's
the
same
painting
you
just
showed
me."
He
winked.
"I
know,
but
the
enlargement
is
so
much
more
exciting.
Don't
you
think?"
Sophie
turned
to
Langdon
for
help.
"I'm
lost."
Langdon
smiled.
"As
it
turns
out,
the
Holy
Grail
does
indeed
make
an
appearance
in
The
Last
Supper.
Leonardo
included
her
prominently."
"Hold
on,"
Sophie
said.
"You
told
me
the
Holy
Grail
is
a
woman.
The
Last
Supper
is
a
painting
of
thirteen
men."
"Is
it?"
Teabing
arched
his
eyebrows.
"Take
a
closer
look."
Uncertain,
Sophie
made
her
way
closer
to
the
painting,
scanning
the
thirteen
figures
Jesus
Christ
in
the
middle,
six
disciples
on
His
left,
and
six
on
His
right.
"They're
all
men,"
she
confirmed.
"Oh?"
Teabing
said.
"How
about
the
one
seated
in
the
place
of
honor,
at
the
right
hand
of
the
Lord?"
Sophie
examined
the
figure
to
Jesus'
immediate
right,
focusing
in.
As
she
studied
the
person's
face
and
body,
a
wave
of
astonishment
rose
within
her.
The
individual
had
flowing
red
hair,
delicate
folded
hands,
and
the
hint
of
a
bosom.
It
was,
without
a
doubt
female.
"That's
a
woman!"
Sophie
exclaimed.
Teabing
was
laughing.
"Surprise,
surprise.
Believe
me,
it's
no
mistake.
Leonardo
was
skilled
at
painting
the
difference
between
the
sexes."
Sophie
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
the
woman
beside
Christ.
The
Last
Supper
is
supposed
to
be
thirteen
men.
Who
is
this
woman?
Although
Sophie
had
seen
this
classic
image
many
times,
she
had
not
once
noticed
this
glaring
discrepancy.
"Everyone
misses
it,"
Teabing
said.
"Our
preconceived
notions
of
this
scene
are
so
powerful
that
our
mind
blocks
out
the
incongruity
and
overrides
our
eyes."
"It's
known
as
skitoma,
"
Langdon
added.
"The
brain
does
it
sometimes
with
powerful
symbols."
"Another
reason
you
might
have
missed
the
woman,"
Teabing
said,
"is
that
many
of
the
photographs
in
art
books
were
taken
before
1954,
when
the
details
were
still
hidden
beneath
layers
of
grime
and
several
restorative
repaintings
done
by
clumsy
hands
in
the
eighteenth
century.
Now,
at
last,
the
fresco
has
been
cleaned
down
to
Da
Vinci's
original
layer
of
paint."
He
motioned
to
the
photograph.
"Etvoilaf"
Sophie
moved
closer
to
the
image.
The
woman
to
Jesus'
right
was
young
and
pious
looking,
with
a
demure
face,
beautiful
red
hair,
and
hands
folded
quietly.
This
is
the
woman
who
singlehandedly
could
crumble
the
Church?
"Who
is
she?"
Sophie
asked.
"That,
my
dear,"
Teabing
replied,
"is
Mary
Magdalene."
Sophie
turned.
"The
prostitute?"
Teabing
drew
a
short
breath,
as
if
the
word
had
injured
him
personally.
"Magdalene
was
no
such
thing.
That
unfortunate
misconception
is
the
legacy
of
a
smear
campaign
launched
by
the
early
Church.
The
Church
needed
to
defame
Mary
Magdalene
in
order
to
cover
up
her
dangerous
secret
her
role
as
the
Holy
Grail."
"Herroe?"
"As
I
mentioned,"
Teabing
clarified,
"the
early
Church
needed
to
convince
the
world
that
the
mortal
prophet
Jesus
was
a
divine
being.
Therefore,
any
gospels
that
described
earthly
aspects
of
Jesus'
life
had
to
be
omitted
from
the
Bible.
Unfortunately
for
the
early
editors,
one
particularly
troubling
earthly
theme
kept
recurring
in
the
gospels.
Mary
Magdalene."
He
paused.
"More
specifically,
her
marriage
to
Jesus
Christ."
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
Sophie's
eyes
moved
to
Langdon
and
then
back
to
Teabing.
"It's
a
matter
of
historical
record,"
Teabing
said,
"and
Da
Vinci
was
certainly
aware
of
that
fact.
The
Last
Supper
practically
shouts
at
the
viewer
that
Jesus
and
Magdalene
were
a
pair.
Sophie
glanced
back
to
the
fresco.
"Notice
that
Jesus
and
Magdalene
are
clothed
as
mirror
images
of
one
another."
Teabing
pointed
to
the
two
individuals
in
the
center
of
the
fresco.
Sophie
was
mesmerized.
Sure
enough,
their
clothes
were
inverse
colors.
Jesus
wore
a
red
robe
and
blue
cloak;
Mary
Magdalene
wore
a
blue
robe
and
red
cloak.
Yin
and
yang.
"Venturing
into
the
more
bizarre,"
Teabing
said,
"note
that
Jesus
and
His
bride
appear
to
be
joined
at
the
hip
and
are
leaning
away
from
one
another
as
if
to
create
this
clearly
delineated
negative
space
between
them."
Even
before
Teabing
traced
the
contour
for
her,
Sophie
saw
it
the
indisputable
V
shape
at
the
focal
point
of
the
painting.
It
was
the
same
symbol
Langdon
had
drawn
earlier
for
the
Grail,
the
chalice,
and
the
female
womb.
"Finally,"
Teabing
said,
"if
you
view
Jesus
and
Magdalene
as
compositional
elements
rather
than
as
people,
you
will
see
another
obvious
shape
leap
out
at
you."
He
paused.
"A
letter
of
the
alphabet."
Sophie
saw
it
at
once.
To
say
the
letter
leapt
out
at
her
was
an
understatement.
The
letter
was
suddenly
all
Sophie
could
see.
Glaring
in
the
center
of
the
painting
was
the
unquestionable
outline
of
an
enormous,
flawlessly
formed
letter
M.
"A
bit
too
perfect
for
coincidence,
wouldn't
you
say?"
Teabing
asked.
Sophie
was
amazed.
"Why
is
it
there?"
Teabing
shrugged.
"Conspiracy
theorists
will
tell
you
it
stands
for
Matrimonio
or
Mary
Magdalene.
To
be
honest,
nobody
is
certain.
The
only
certainty
is
that
the
hidden
M
is
no
mistake.
Countless
Grail
related
works
contain
the
hidden
letter
M
whether
as
watermarks,
underpaintings,
or
compositional
allusions.
The
most
blatant
M,
of
course,
is
emblazoned
on
the
altar
at
Our
Lady
of
Paris
in
London,
which
was
designed
by
a
former
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion,
Jean
Cocteau."
Sophie
weighed
the
information.
"I'll
admit,
the
hidden
M's
are
intriguing,
although
I
assume
nobody
is
claiming
they
are
proof
of
Jesus'
marriage
to
Magdalene."
"No,
no,"
Teabing
said,
going
to
a
nearby
table
of
books.
"As
I
said
earlier,
the
marriage
of
Jesus
and
Mary
Magdalene
is
part
of
the
historical
record.
"
He
began
pawing
through
his
book
collection.
"Moreover,
Jesus
as
a
married
man
makes
infinitely
more
sense
than
our
standard
biblical
view
of
Jesus
as
a
bachelor.
"Why?"
Sophie
asked.
"Because
Jesus
was
a
Jew,"
Langdon
said,
taking
over
while
Teabing
searched
for
his
book,
"and
the
social
decorum
during
that
time
virtually
forbid
a
Jewish
man
to
be
unmarried.
According
to
Jewish
custom,
celibacy
was
condemned,
and
the
obligation
for
a
Jewish
father
was
to
find
a
suitable
wife
for
his
son.
If
Jesus
were
not
married,
at
least
one
of
the
Bible's
gospels
would
have
mentioned
it
and
offered
some
explanation
for
His
unnatural
state
of
bachelorhood."
Teabing
located
a
huge
book
and
pulled
it
toward
him
across
the
table.
The
leather
bound
edition
was
poster
sized,
like
a
huge
atlas.
The
cover
read:
The
Gnostic
Gospels.
Teabing
heaved
it
open,
and
Langdon
and
Sophie
joined
him.
Sophie
could
see
it
contained
photographs
of
what
appeared
to
be
magnified
passages
of
ancient
documents
tattered
papyrus
with
handwritten
text.
She
did
not
recognize
the
ancient
language,
but
the
facing
pages
bore
typed
translations.
"These
are
photocopies
of
the
Nag
Hammadi
and
Dead
Sea
scrolls,
which
I
mentioned
earlier,"
Teabing
said.
"The
earliest
Christian
records.
Troublingly,
they
do
not
match
up
with
the
gospels
in
the
Bible."
Flipping
toward
the
middle
of
the
book,
Teabing
pointed
to
a
passage.
"The
Gospel
of
Philip
is
always
a
good
place
to
start."
Sophie
read
the
passage:
And
the
companion
of
the
Saviour
is
Mary
Magdalene.
Christ
loved
her
more
than
all
the
disciples
and
used
to
kiss
her
often
on
her
mouth.
The
rest
of
the
disciples
were
offended
by
it
and
expressed
disapproval.
They
said
to
him,
"Why
do
you
love
her
more
than
all
of
us?"
The
words
surprised
Sophie,
and
yet
they
hardly
seemed
conclusive.
"It
says
nothing
of
marriage."
"Au
contraire.
"
Teabing
smiled,
pointing
to
the
first
line.
"As
any
Aramaic
scholar
will
tell
you,
the
word
companion,
in
those
days,
literally
meant
spouse.
Langdon
concurred
with
a
nod.
Sophie
read
the
first
line
again.
And
the
companion
of
the
Saviour
is
Mary
Magdalene.
Teabing
flipped
through
the
book
and
pointed
out
several
other
passages
that,
to
Sophie's
surprise,
clearly
suggested
Magdalene
and
Jesus
had
a
romantic
relationship.
As
she
read
the
passages,
Sophie
recalled
an
angry
priest
who
had
banged
on
her
grandfather's
door
when
she
was
a
schoolgirl.
"Is
this
the
home
of
Jacques
Sauniere?"
the
priest
had
demanded,
glaring
down
at
young
Sophie
when
she
pulled
open
the
door.
"I
want
to
talk
to
him
about
this
editorial
he
wrote."
The
priest
held
up
a
newspaper.
Sophie
summoned
her
grandfather,
and
the
two
men
disappeared
into
his
study
and
closed
the
door.
My
grandfather
wrote
something
in
the
paper?
Sophie
immediately
ran
to
the
kitchen
and
flipped
through
that
morning's
paper.
She
found
her
grandfather's
name
on
an
article
on
the
second
page.
She
read
it.
Sophie
didn't
understand
all
of
what
was
said,
but
it
sounded
like
the
French
government,
under
pressure
from
priests,
had
agreed
to
ban
an
American
movie
called
The
Last
Temptation
of
Christ,
which
was
about
Jesus
having
sex
with
a
lady
called
Mary
Magdalene.
Her
grandfather's
article
said
the
Church
was
arrogant
and
wrong
to
ban
it.
No
wonder
the
priest
is
mad,
Sophie
thought.
"It's
pornography!
Sacrilege!"
the
priest
yelled,
emerging
from
the
study
and
storming
to
the
front
door.
"How
can
you
possibly
endorse
that!
This
American
Martin
Scorsese
is
a
blasphemer,
and
the
Church
will
permit
him
no
pulpit
in
France
!
"
The
priest
slammed
the
door
on
his
way
out.
When
her
grandfather
came
into
the
kitchen,
he
saw
Sophie
with
the
paper
and
frowned.
"You're
quick."
Sophie
said,
"You
think
Jesus
Christ
had
a
girlfriend?"
"No,
dear,
I
said
the
Church
should
not
be
allowed
to
tell
us
what
notions
we
can
and
can't
entertain.
"Did
Jesus
have
a
girlfriend?"
Her
grandfather
was
silent
for
several
moments.
"Would
it
be
so
bad
if
He
did?"
Sophie
considered
it
and
then
shrugged.
"I
wouldn't
mind."
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
was
still
talking.
"I
shan't
bore
you
with
the
countless
references
to
Jesus
and
Magdalene's
union.
That
has
been
explored
ad
nauseum
by
modern
historians.
I
would,
however,
like
to
point
out
the
following."
He
motioned
to
another
passage.
"This
is
from
the
Gospel
of
Mary
Magdalene."
Sophie
had
not
known
a
gospel
existed
in
Magdalene's
words.
She
read
the
text:
And
Peter
said,
"Did
the
Saviour
really
speak
with
a
woman
without
our
knowledge
?
Are
we
to
turn
about
and
all
listen
to
her?
Did
he
prefer
her
to
us?"
And
Levi
answered,
"Peter,
you
have
always
been
hot
tempered.
Now
I
see
you
contending
against
the
woman
like
an
adversary.
If
the
Saviour
made
her
worthy,
who
are
you
indeed
to
reject
her?
Surely
the
Saviour
knows
her
very
well.
That
is
why
he
loved
her
more
than
us.
"The
woman
they
are
speaking
of,"
Teabing
explained,
"is
Mary
Magdalene.
Peter
is
jealous
of
her."
"Because
Jesus
preferred
Mary?"
"Not
only
that.
The
stakes
were
far
greater
than
mere
affection.
At
this
point
in
the
gospels,
Jesus
suspects
He
will
soon
be
captured
and
crucified.
So
He
gives
Mary
Magdalene
instructions
on
how
to
carry
on
His
Church
after
He
is
gone.
As
a
result,
Peter
expresses
his
discontent
over
playing
second
fiddle
to
a
woman.
I
daresay
Peter
was
something
of
a
sexist."
Sophie
was
trying
to
keep
up.
"This
is
Saint
Peter.
The
rock
on
which
Jesus
built
His
Church."
"The
same,
except
for
one
catch.
According
to
these
unaltered
gospels,
it
was
not
Peter
to
whom
Christ
gave
directions
with
which
to
establish
the
Christian
Church.
It
was
Mary
Magdalene.
Sophie
looked
at
him.
"You're
saying
the
Christian
Church
was
to
be
carried
on
by
a
woman?"
"That
was
the
plan.
Jesus
was
the
original
feminist.
He
intended
for
the
future
of
His
Church
to
be
in
the
hands
of
Mary
Magdalene."
"And
Peter
had
a
problem
with
that,"
Langdon
said,
pointing
to
The
Last
Supper.
"That's
Peter
there.
You
can
see
that
Da
Vinci
was
well
aware
of
how
Peter
felt
about
Mary
Magdalene."
Again,
Sophie
was
speechless.
In
the
painting,
Peter
was
leaning
menacingly
toward
Mary
Magdalene
and
slicing
his
blade
like
hand
across
her
neck.
The
same
threatening
gesture
as
in
Madonna
of
the
Rocks!
"And
here
too,"
Langdon
said,
pointing
now
to
the
crowd
of
disciples
near
Peter.
"A
bit
ominous,
no?"
Sophie
squinted
and
saw
a
hand
emerging
from
the
crowd
of
disciples.
"Is
that
hand
wielding
a
dagger?"
"Yes.
Stranger
still,
if
you
count
the
arms,
you'll
see
that
this
hand
belongs
to
no
one
at
all.
It's
disembodied.
Anonymous."
Sophie
was
starting
to
feel
overwhelmed.
"I'm
sorry,
I
still
don't
understand
how
all
of
this
makes
Mary
Magdalene
the
Holy
Grail."
"Aha!"
Teabing
exclaimed
again.
"Therein
lies
the
rub!"
He
turned
once
more
to
the
table
and
pulled
out
a
large
chart,
spreading
it
out
for
her.
It
was
an
elaborate
genealogy.
"Few
people
realize
that
Mary
Magdalene,
in
addition
to
being
Christ's
right
hand,
was
a
powerful
woman
already."
Sophie
could
now
see
the
title
of
the
family
tree.
THE
TRIBE
OF
BENJAMIN
"Mary
Magdalene
is
here,"
Teabing
said,
pointing
near
the
top
of
the
genealogy.
Sophie
was
surprised.
"She
was
of
the
House
of
Benjamin?"
"Indeed,"
Teabing
said.
"Mary
Magdalene
was
of
royal
descent."
"But
I
was
under
the
impression
Magdalene
was
poor."
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"Magdalene
was
recast
as
a
whore
in
order
to
erase
evidence
of
her
powerful
family
ties."
Sophie
found
herself
again
glancing
at
Langdon,
who
again
nodded.
She
turned
back
to
Teabing.
"But
why
would
the
early
Church
care
if
Magdalene
had
royal
blood?"
The
Briton
smiled.
"My
dear
child,
it
was
not
Mary
Magdalene's
royal
blood
that
concerned
the
Church
so
much
as
it
was
her
consorting
with
Christ,
who
also
had
royal
blood.
As
you
know,
the
Book
of
Matthew
tells
us
that
Jesus
was
of
the
House
of
David.
A
descendant
of
King
Solomon
King
of
the
Jews.
By
marrying
into
the
powerful
House
of
Benjamin,
Jesus
fused
two
royal
bloodlines,
creating
a
potent
political
union
with
the
potential
of
making
a
legitimate
claim
to
the
throne
and
restoring
the
line
of
kings
as
it
was
under
Solomon."
Sophie
sensed
he
was
at
last
coming
to
his
point.
Teabing
looked
excited
now.
"The
legend
of
the
Holy
Grail
is
a
legend
about
royal
blood.
When
Grail
legend
speaks
of
'the
chalice
that
held
the
blood
of
Christ'
it
speaks,
in
fact,
of
Mary
Magdalene
the
female
womb
that
carried
Jesus'
royal
bloodline."
The
words
seemed
to
echo
across
the
ballroom
and
back
before
they
fully
registered
in
Sophie's
mind.
Mary
Magdalene
carried
the
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ?
"But
how
could
Christ
have
a
bloodline
unless?"
She
paused
and
looked
at
Langdon.
Langdon
smiled
softly.
"Unless
they
had
a
child."
Sophie
stood
transfixed.
"Behold,"
Teabing
proclaimed,
"the
greatest
cover
up
in
human
history.
Not
only
was
Jesus
Christ
married,
but
He
was
a
father.
My
dear,
Mary
Magdalene
was
the
Holy
Vessel.
She
was
the
chalice
that
bore
the
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ.
She
was
the
womb
that
bore
the
lineage,
and
the
vine
from
which
the
sacred
fruit
sprang
forth!"
Sophie
felt
the
hairs
stand
up
on
her
arms.
"But
how
could
a
secret
that
big
be
kept
quiet
all
of
these
years?"
"Heavens!"
Teabing
said.
"It
has
been
anything
but
quiet!
The
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ
is
the
source
of
the
most
enduring
legend
of
all
time
the
Holy
Grail.
Magdalene's
story
has
been
shouted
from
the
rooftops
for
centuries
in
all
kinds
of
metaphors
and
languages.
Her
story
is
everywhere
once
you
open
your
eyes."
"And
the
Sangreal
documents?"
Sophie
said.
"They
allegedly
contain
proof
that
Jesus
had
a
royal
bloodline?"
"They
do."
"So
the
entire
Holy
Grail
legend
is
all
about
royal
blood?"
"Quite
literally,"
Teabing
said.
"The
word
Sangreal
derives
from
San
Great
or
Holy
Grail.
But
in
its
most
ancient
form,
the
word
Sangreal
was
divided
in
a
different
spot."
Teabing
wrote
on
a
piece
of
scrap
paper
and
handed
it
to
her.
She
read
what
he
had
written.
Sang
Real
Instantly,
Sophie
recognized
the
translation.
Sang
Real
literally
meant
Royal
Blood.
The
male
receptionist
in
the
lobby
of
the
Opus
Dei
headquarters
on
Lexington
Avenue
in
New
York
City
was
surprised
to
hear
Bishop
Aringarosa's
voice
on
the
line.
"Good
evening,
sir."
"Have
I
had
any
messages?"
the
bishop
demanded,
sounding
unusually
anxious.
"Yes,
sir.
I'm
very
glad
you
called
in.
I
couldn't
reach
you
in
your
apartment.
You
had
an
urgent
phone
message
about
half
an
hour
ago."
"Yes?"
He
sounded
relieved
by
the
news.
"Did
the
caller
leave
a
name?"
"No,
sir,
just
a
number."
The
operator
relayed
the
number.
"Prefix
thirty
three?
That's
France,
am
I
right?"
"Yes,
sir.
Paris.
The
caller
said
it
was
critical
you
contact
him
immediately."
"Thank
you.
I
have
been
waiting
for
that
call."
Aringarosa
quickly
severed
the
connection.
As
the
receptionist
hung
up
the
receiver,
he
wondered
why
Aringarosa's
phone
connection
sounded
so
crackly.
The
bishop's
daily
schedule
showed
him
in
New
York
this
weekend,
and
yet
he
sounded
a
world
away.
The
receptionist
shrugged
it
off.
Bishop
Aringarosa
had
been
acting
very
strangely
the
last
few
months.
My
cellular
phone
must
not
have
been
receiving,
Aringarosa
thought
as
the
Fiat
approached
the
exit
for
Rome's
Ciampino
Charter
Airport.
The
Teacher
was
trying
to
reach
me.
Despite
Aringarosa's
concern
at
having
missed
the
call,
he
felt
encouraged
that
the
Teacher
felt
confident
enough
to
call
Opus
Dei
headquarters
directly.
Things
must
have
gone
well
in
Paris
tonight.
As
Aringarosa
began
dialing
the
number,
he
felt
excited
to
know
he
would
soon
be
in
Paris.
I'll
be
on
the
ground
before
dawn.
Aringarosa
had
a
chartered
turbo
prop
awaiting
him
here
for
the
short
flight
to
France.
Commercial
carriers
were
not
an
option
at
this
hour,
especially
considering
the
contents
of
his
briefcase.
The
line
began
to
ring.
A
female
voice
answered.
"Direction
Centrale
Police
Judidaire.
Aringarosa
felt
himself
hesitate.
This
was
unexpected.
"Ah,
yes
I
was
asked
to
call
this
number?"
"Qui
etes
vous?"
the
woman
said.
"Your
name?"
Aringarosa
was
uncertain
if
he
should
reveal
it.
The
French
Judicial
Police
?
"Your
name,
monsieur?"
the
woman
pressed.
"Bishop
Manuel
Aringarosa."
"Un
moment.
"
There
was
a
click
on
the
line.
After
a
long
wait,
another
man
came
on,
his
tone
gruff
and
concerned.
"Bishop,
I
am
glad
I
finally
reached
you.
You
and
I
have
much
to
discuss."
Sangreal
Sang
Real
San
Great.
Royal
Blood
Holy
Grail.
It
was
all
intertwined.
The
Holy
Grail
is
Mary
Magdalene
the
mother
of
the
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ.
Sophie
felt
a
new
wave
of
disorientation
as
she
stood
in
the
silence
of
the
ballroom
and
stared
at
Robert
Langdon.
The
more
pieces
Langdon
and
Teabing
laid
on
the
table
tonight,
the
more
unpredictable
this
puzzle
became.
"As
you
can
see,
my
dear,"
Teabing
said,
hobbling
toward
a
bookshelf,
"Leonardo
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
been
trying
to
tell
the
world
the
truth
about
the
Holy
Grail.
The
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ
has
been
chronicled
in
exhaustive
detail
by
scores
of
historians."
He
ran
a
finger
down
a
row
of
several
dozen
books.
Sophie
tilted
her
head
and
scanned
the
list
of
titles:
THE
TEMPLAR
REVELATION:
Secret
Guardians
of
the
True
Identity
of
Christ
THE
WOMAN
WITH
THE
ALABASTER
JAR:
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
Holy
Grail
THE
GODDESS
IN
THE
GOSPELS
Reclaiming
the
Sacred
Feminine
"Here
is
perhaps
the
best
known
tome,"
Teabing
said,
pulling
a
tattered
hardcover
from
the
stack
and
handing
it
to
her.
The
cover
read:
HOLY
BLOOD,
HOLY
GRAIL
The
Acclaimed
International
Bestseller
Sophie
glanced
up.
"An
international
bestseller?
I've
never
heard
of
it."
"You
were
young.
This
caused
quite
a
stir
back
in
the
nineteen
eighties.
To
my
taste,
the
authors
made
some
dubious
leaps
of
faith
in
their
analysis,
but
their
fundamental
premise
is
sound,
and
to
their
credit,
they
finally
brought
the
idea
of
Christ's
bloodline
into
the
mainstream."
"What
was
the
Church's
reaction
to
the
book?"
"Outrage,
of
course.
But
that
was
to
be
expected.
After
all,
this
was
a
secret
the
Vatican
had
tried
to
bury
in
the
fourth
century.
That's
part
of
what
the
Crusades
were
about.
Gathering
and
destroying
information.
The
threat
Mary
Magdalene
posed
to
the
men
of
the
early
Church
was
potentially
ruinous.
Not
only
was
she
the
woman
to
whom
Jesus
had
assigned
the
task
of
founding
the
Church,
but
she
also
had
physical
proof
that
the
Church's
newly
proclaimed
deity
had
spawned
a
mortal
bloodline.
The
Church,
in
order
to
defend
itself
against
the
Magdalene's
power,
perpetuated
her
image
as
a
whore
and
buried
evidence
of
Christ's
marriage
to
her,
thereby
defusing
any
potential
claims
that
Christ
had
a
surviving
bloodline
and
was
a
mortal
prophet."
Sophie
glanced
at
Langdon,
who
nodded.
"Sophie,
the
historical
evidence
supporting
this
is
substantial."
"I
admit,"
Teabing
said,
"the
assertions
are
dire,
but
you
must
understand
the
Church's
powerful
motivations
to
conduct
such
a
cover
up.
They
could
never
have
survived
public
knowledge
of
a
bloodline.
A
child
of
Jesus
would
undermine
the
critical
notion
of
Christ's
divinity
and
therefore
the
Christian
Church,
which
declared
itself
the
sole
vessel
through
which
humanity
could
access
the
divine
and
gain
entrance
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven."
"The
five
petal
rose,"
Sophie
said,
pointing
suddenly
to
the
spine
of
one
of
Teabing's
books.
The
same
exact
design
inlaid
on
the
rosewood
box.
Teabing
glanced
at
Langdon
and
grinned.
"She
has
a
good
eye."
He
turned
back
to
Sophie.
"That
is
the
Priory
symbol
for
the
Grail.
Mary
Magdalene.
Because
her
name
was
forbidden
by
the
Church,
Mary
Magdalene
became
secretly
known
by
many
pseudonyms
the
Chalice,
the
Holy
Grail,
and
the
Rose."
He
paused.
"The
Rose
has
ties
to
the
five
pointed
pentacle
of
Venus
and
the
guiding
Compass
Rose.
By
the
way,
the
word
rose
is
identical
in
English,
French,
German,
and
many
other
languages."
"Rose,"
Langdon
added,
"is
also
an
anagram
of
Eros,
the
Greek
god
of
sexual
love."
Sophie
gave
him
a
surprised
look
as
Teabing
plowed
on.
"The
Rose
has
always
been
the
premiere
symbol
of
female
sexuality.
In
primitive
goddess
cults,
the
five
petals
represented
the
five
stations
of
female
life
birth,
menstruation,
motherhood,
menopause,
and
death.
And
in
modern
times,
the
flowering
rose's
ties
to
womanhood
are
considered
more
visual."
He
glanced
at
Robert.
"Perhaps
the
symbologist
could
explain?"
Robert
hesitated.
A
moment
too
long.
"Oh,
heavens!"
Teabing
huffed.
"You
Americans
are
such
prudes."
He
looked
back
at
Sophie.
"What
Robert
is
fumbling
with
is
the
fact
that
the
blossoming
flower
resembles
the
female
genitalia,
the
sublime
blossom
from
which
all
mankind
enters
the
world.
And
if
you've
ever
seen
any
paintings
by
Georgia
O'Keeffe,
you'll
know
exactly
what
I
mean.
"The
point
here,"
Langdon
said,
motioning
back
to
the
bookshelf,
"is
that
all
of
these
books
substantiate
the
same
historical
claim."
"That
Jesus
was
a
father."
Sophie
was
still
uncertain.
"Yes,"
Teabing
said.
"And
that
Mary
Magdalene
was
the
womb
that
carried
His
royal
lineage.
The
Priory
of
Sion,
to
this
day,
still
worships
Mary
Magdalene
as
the
Goddess,
the
Holy
Grail,
the
Rose,
and
the
Divine
Mother."
Sophie
again
flashed
on
the
ritual
in
the
basement.
"According
to
the
Priory,"
Teabing
continued,
"Mary
Magdalene
was
pregnant
at
the
time
of
the
crucifixion.
For
the
safety
of
Christ's
unborn
child,
she
had
no
choice
but
to
flee
the
Holy
Land.
With
the
help
of
Jesus'
trusted
uncle,
Joseph
of
Arimathea,
Mary
Magdalene
secretly
traveled
to
France,
then
known
as
Gaul.
There
she
found
safe
refuge
in
the
Jewish
community.
It
was
here
in
France
that
she
gave
birth
to
a
daughter.
Her
name
was
Sarah."
Sophie
glanced
up.
"They
actually
know
the
child's
name?"
"Far
more
than
that.
Magdalene's
and
Sarah's
lives
were
scrutinously
chronicled
by
their
Jewish
protectors.
Remember
that
Magdalene's
child
belonged
to
the
lineage
of
Jewish
kings
David
and
Solomon.
For
this
reason,
the
Jews
in
France
considered
Magdalene
sacred
royalty
and
revered
her
as
the
progenitor
of
the
royal
line
of
kings.
Countless
scholars
of
that
era
chronicled
Mary
Magdalene's
days
in
France,
including
the
birth
of
Sarah
and
the
subsequent
family
tree."
Sophie
was
startled.
"There
exists
a
family
tree
of
Jesus
Christ?"
"Indeed.
And
it
is
purportedly
one
of
the
cornerstones
of
the
Sangreal
documents.
A
complete
genealogy
of
the
early
descendants
of
Christ."
"But
what
good
is
a
documented
genealogy
of
Christ's
bloodline?"
Sophie
asked.
"It's
not
proof.
Historians
could
not
possibly
confirm
its
authenticity."
Teabing
chuckled.
"No
more
so
than
they
can
confirm
the
authenticity
of
the
Bible.
"Meaning?"
"Meaning
that
history
is
always
written
by
the
winners.
When
two
cultures
clash,
the
loser
is
obliterated,
and
the
winner
writes
the
history
books
books
which
glorify
their
own
cause
and
disparage
the
conquered
foe.
As
Napoleon
once
said,
'What
is
history,
but
a
fable
agreed
upon?'
He
smiled.
"By
its
very
nature,
history
is
always
a
one
sided
account."
Sophie
had
never
thought
of
it
that
way.
"The
Sangreal
documents
simply
tell
the
other
side
of
the
Christ
story.
In
the
end,
which
side
of
the
story
you
believe
becomes
a
matter
of
faith
and
personal
exploration,
but
at
least
the
information
has
survived.
The
Sangreal
documents
include
tens
of
thousands
of
pages
of
information.
Eyewitness
accounts
of
the
Sangreal
treasure
describe
it
as
being
carried
in
four
enormous
trunks.
In
those
trunks
are
reputed
to
be
the
Purist
Documents
thousands
of
pages
of
unaltered,
pre
Constantine
documents,
written
by
the
early
followers
of
Jesus,
revering
Him
as
a
wholly
human
teacher
and
prophet.
Also
rumored
to
be
part
of
the
treasure
is
the
legendary
"Q"
Document
a
manuscript
that
even
the
Vatican
admits
they
believe
exists.
Allegedly,
it
is
a
book
of
Jesus'
teachings,
possibly
written
in
His
own
hand."
"Writings
by
Christ
Himself?"
"Of
course,"
Teabing
said.
"Why
wouldn't
Jesus
have
kept
a
chronicle
of
His
ministry?
Most
people
did
in
those
days.
Another
explosive
document
believed
to
be
in
the
treasure
is
a
manuscript
called
The
Magdalene
Diaries
Mary
Magdalene's
personal
account
of
her
relationship
with
Christ,
His
crucifixion,
and
her
time
in
France."
Sophie
was
silent
for
a
long
moment.
"And
these
four
chests
of
documents
were
the
treasure
that
the
Knights
Templar
found
under
Solomon's
Temple?"
"Exactly.
The
documents
that
made
the
Knights
so
powerful.
The
documents
that
have
been
the
object
of
countless
Grail
quests
throughout
history."
"But
you
said
the
Holy
Grail
was
Mary
Magdalene.
If
people
are
searching
for
documents,
why
would
you
call
it
a
search
for
the
Holy
Grail?"
Teabing
eyed
her,
his
expression
softening.
"Because
the
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail
includes
a
sarcophagus."
Outside,
the
wind
howled
in
the
trees.
Teabing
spoke
more
quietly
now.
"The
quest
for
the
Holy
Grail
is
literally
the
quest
to
kneel
before
the
bones
of
Mary
Magdalene.
A
journey
to
pray
at
the
feet
of
the
outcast
one,
the
lost
sacred
feminine."
Sophie
felt
an
unexpected
wonder.
"The
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail
is
actually
a
tomb?"
Teabing's
hazel
eyes
got
misty.
"It
is.
A
tomb
containing
the
body
of
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
documents
that
tell
the
true
story
of
her
life.
At
its
heart,
the
quest
for
the
Holy
Grail
has
always
been
a
quest
for
the
Magdalene
the
wronged
Queen,
entombed
with
proof
of
her
family's
rightful
claim
to
power.
Sophie
waited
a
moment
as
Teabing
gathered
himself.
So
much
about
her
grandfather
was
still
not
making
sense.
"Members
of
the
Priory,"
she
finally
said,
"all
these
years
have
answered
the
charge
of
protecting
the
Sangreal
documents
and
the
tomb
of
Mary
Magdalene?"
"Yes,
but
the
brotherhood
had
another,
more
important
duty
as
well
to
protect
the
bloodline
itself.
Christ's
lineage
was
in
perpetual
danger.
The
early
Church
feared
that
if
the
lineage
were
permitted
to
grow,
the
secret
of
Jesus
and
Magdalene
would
eventually
surface
and
challenge
the
fundamental
Catholic
doctrine
that
of
a
divine
Messiah
who
did
not
consort
with
women
or
engage
in
sexual
union."
He
paused.
"Nonetheless,
Christ's
line
grew
quietly
under
cover
in
France
until
making
a
bold
move
in
the
fifth
century,
when
it
intermarried
with
French
royal
blood
and
created
a
lineage
known
as
the
Merovingian
bloodline.
This
news
surprised
Sophie.
Merovingian
was
a
term
learned
by
every
student
in
France.
"The
Merovingians
founded
Paris."
"Yes.
That's
one
of
the
reasons
the
Grail
legend
is
so
rich
in
France.
Many
of
the
Vatican's
Grail
quests
here
were
in
fact
stealth
missions
to
erase
members
of
the
royal
bloodline.
Have
you
heard
of
King
Dagobert?"
Sophie
vaguely
recalled
the
name
from
a
grisly
tale
in
history
class.
"Dagobert
was
a
Merovingian
king,
wasn't
he?
Stabbed
in
the
eye
while
sleeping?"
"Exactly.
Assassinated
by
the
Vatican
in
collusion
with
Pepin
d'Heristal.
Late
seventh
century.
With
Dagobert's
murder,
the
Merovingian
bloodline
was
almost
exterminated.
Fortunately,
Dagobert's
son,
Sigisbert,
secretly
escaped
the
attack
and
carried
on
the
lineage,
which
later
included
Godefroi
de
Bouillon
founder
of
the
Priory
of
Sion."
"The
same
man,"
Langdon
said,
"who
ordered
the
Knights
Templar
to
recover
the
Sangreal
documents
from
beneath
Solomon's
Temple
and
thus
provide
the
Merovingians
proof
of
their
hereditary
ties
to
Jesus
Christ."
Teabing
nodded,
heaving
a
ponderous
sigh.
"The
modern
Priory
of
Sion
has
a
momentous
duty.
Theirs
is
a
threefold
charge.
The
brotherhood
must
protect
the
Sangreal
documents.
They
must
protect
the
tomb
of
Mary
Magdalene.
And,
of
course,
they
must
nurture
and
protect
the
bloodline
of
Christ
those
few
members
of
the
royal
Merovingian
bloodline
who
have
survived
into
modern
times."
The
words
hung
in
the
huge
space,
and
Sophie
felt
an
odd
vibration,
as
if
her
bones
were
reverberating
with
some
new
kind
of
truth.
Descendants
of
Jesus
who
survived
into
modern
times.
Her
grandfather's
voice
again
was
whispering
in
her
ear.
Princess,
I
must
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
family.
A
chill
raked
her
flesh.
Royal
blood.
She
could
not
imagine.
Princess
Sophie.
"Sir
Leigh?"
The
manservant's
words
crackled
through
the
intercom
on
the
wall,
and
Sophie
jumped.
"If
you
could
join
me
in
the
kitchen
a
moment?"
Teabing
scowled
at
the
ill
timed
intrusion.
He
went
over
to
the
intercom
and
pressed
the
button.
"Remy,
as
you
know,
I
am
busy
with
my
guests.
If
we
need
anything
else
from
the
kitchen
tonight,
we
will
help
ourselves.
Thank
you
and
good
night."
"A
word
with
you
before
I
retire,
sir.
If
you
would."
Teabing
grunted
and
pressed
the
button.
"Make
it
quick,
Remy."
"It
is
a
household
matter,
sir,
hardly
fare
for
guests
to
endure."
Teabing
looked
incredulous.
"And
it
cannot
wait
until
morning?"
"No,
sir.
My
question
won't
take
a
minute."
Teabing
rolled
his
eyes
and
looked
at
Langdon
and
Sophie.
"Sometimes
I
wonder
who
is
serving
whom?"
He
pressed
the
button
again.
"I'll
be
right
there,
Remy.
Can
I
bring
you
anything
when
I
come?"
"Only
freedom
from
oppression,
sir."
"Remy,
you
realize
your
steak
au
poivre
is
the
only
reason
you
still
work
for
me."
"So
you
tell
me,
sir.
So
you
tell
me."
Princess
Sophie.
Sophie
felt
hollow
as
she
listened
to
the
clicking
of
Teabing's
crutches
fade
down
the
hallway.
Numb,
she
turned
and
faced
Langdon
in
the
deserted
ballroom.
He
was
already
shaking
his
head
as
if
reading
her
mind.
"No,
Sophie,"
he
whispered,
his
eyes
reassuring.
"The
same
thought
crossed
my
mind
when
I
realized
your
grandfather
was
in
the
Priory,
and
you
said
he
wanted
to
tell
you
a
secret
about
your
family.
But
it's
impossible."
Langdon
paused.
"Sauniere
is
not
a
Merovingian
name."
Sophie
wasn't
sure
whether
to
feel
relieved
or
disappointed.
Earlier,
Langdon
had
asked
an
unusual
passing
question
about
Sophie's
mother's
maiden
name.
Chauvel.
The
question
now
made
sense.
"And
Chauvel?"
she
asked,
anxious.
Again
he
shook
his
head.
"I'm
sorry.
I
know
that
would
have
answered
some
questions
for
you.
Only
two
direct
lines
of
Merovingians
remain.
Their
family
names
are
Plantard
and
Saint
Clair.
Both
families
live
in
hiding,
probably
protected
by
the
Priory."
Sophie
repeated
the
names
silently
in
her
mind
and
then
shook
her
head.
There
was
no
one
in
her
family
named
Plantard
or
Saint
Clair.
A
weary
undertow
was
pulling
at
her
now.
She
realized
she
was
no
closer
than
she
had
been
at
the
Louvre
to
understanding
what
truth
her
grandfather
had
wanted
to
reveal
to
her.
Sophie
wished
her
grandfather
had
never
mentioned
her
family
this
afternoon.
He
had
torn
open
old
wounds
that
felt
as
painful
now
as
ever.
They
are
dead,
Sophie.
They
are
not
coming
back.
She
thought
of
her
mother
singing
her
to
sleep
at
night,
of
her
father
giving
her
rides
on
his
shoulders,
and
of
her
grandmother
and
younger
brother
smiling
at
her
with
their
fervent
green
eyes.
All
that
was
stolen.
And
all
she
had
left
was
her
grandfather.
And
now
he
is
gone
too.
I
am
alone.
Sophie
turned
quietly
back
to
The
Last
Supper
and
gazed
at
Mary
Magdalene's
long
red
hair
and
quiet
eyes.
There
was
something
in
the
woman's
expression
that
echoed
the
loss
of
a
loved
one.
Sophie
could
feel
it
too.
"Robert?"
she
said
softly.
He
stepped
closer.
"I
know
Leigh
said
the
Grail
story
is
all
around
us,
but
tonight
is
the
first
time
I've
ever
heard
any
of
this."
Langdon
looked
as
if
he
wanted
to
put
a
comforting
hand
on
her
shoulder,
but
he
refrained.
"You've
heard
her
story
before,
Sophie.
Everyone
has.
We
just
don't
realize
it
when
we
hear
it."
"I
don't
understand."
"The
Grail
story
is
everywhere,
but
it
is
hidden.
When
the
Church
outlawed
speaking
of
the
shunned
Mary
Magdalene,
her
story
and
importance
had
to
be
passed
on
through
more
discreet
channels
channels
that
supported
metaphor
and
symbolism."
"Of
course.
The
arts."
Langdon
motioned
to
The
Last
Supper.
"A
perfect
example.
Some
of
today's
most
enduring
art,
literature,
and
music
secretly
tell
the
history
of
Mary
Magdalene
and
Jesus."
Langdon
quickly
told
her
about
works
by
Da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
Poussin,
Bernini,
Mozart,
and
Victor
Hugo
that
all
whispered
of
the
quest
to
restore
the
banished
sacred
feminine.
Enduring
legends
like
Sir
Gawain
and
the
Green
Knight,
King
Arthur,
and
Sleeping
Beauty
were
Grail
allegories.
Victor
Hugo's
Hunchback
of
Notre
Dame
and
Mozart's
Magic
Flute
were
filled
with
Masonic
symbolism
and
Grail
secrets.
"Once
you
open
your
eyes
to
the
Holy
Grail,"
Langdon
said,
"you
see
her
everywhere.
Paintings.
Music.
Books.
Even
in
cartoons,
theme
parks,
and
popular
movies."
Langdon
held
up
his
Mickey
Mouse
watch
and
told
her
that
Walt
Disney
had
made
it
his
quiet
life's
work
to
pass
on
the
Grail
story
to
future
generations.
Throughout
his
entire
life,
Disney
had
been
hailed
as
"the
Modern
Day
Leonardo
da
Vinci."
Both
men
were
generations
ahead
of
their
times,
uniquely
gifted
artists,
members
of
secret
societies,
and,
most
notably,
avid
pranksters.
Like
Leonardo,
Walt
Disney
loved
infusing
hidden
messages
and
symbolism
in
his
art.
For
the
trained
symbologist,
watching
an
early
Disney
movie
was
like
being
barraged
by
an
avalanche
of
allusion
and
metaphor.
Most
of
Disney's
hidden
messages
dealt
with
religion,
pagan
myth,
and
stories
of
the
subjugated
goddess.
It
was
no
mistake
that
Disney
retold
tales
like
Cinderella,
Sleeping
Beauty,
and
Snow
White
all
of
which
dealt
with
the
incarceration
of
the
sacred
feminine.
Nor
did
one
need
a
background
in
symbolism
to
understand
that
Snow
White
a
princess
who
fell
from
grace
after
partaking
of
a
poisoned
apple
was
a
clear
allusion
to
the
downfall
of
Eve
in
the
Garden
of
Eden.
Or
that
Sleeping
Beauty's
Princess
Aurora
code
named
"Rose"
and
hidden
deep
in
the
forest
to
protect
her
from
the
clutches
of
the
evil
witch
was
the
Grail
story
for
children.
Despite
its
corporate
image,
Disney
still
had
a
savvy,
playful
element
among
its
employees,
and
their
artists
still
amused
themselves
by
inserting
hidden
symbolism
in
Disney
products.
Langdon
would
never
forget
one
of
his
students
bringing
in
a
DVD
of
The
Lion
King
and
pausing
the
film
to
reveal
a
freeze
frame
in
which
the
word
SEX
was
clearly
visible,
spelled
out
by
floating
dust
particles
over
Simba's
head.
Although
Langdon
suspected
this
was
more
of
a
cartoonist's
sophomoric
prank
than
any
kind
of
enlightened
allusion
to
pagan
human
sexuality,
he
had
learned
not
to
underestimate
Disney's
grasp
of
symbolism.
The
Little
Mermaid
was
a
spellbinding
tapestry
of
spiritual
symbols
so
specifically
goddess
related
that
they
could
not
be
coincidence.
When
Langdon
had
first
seen
The
Little
Mermaid,
he
had
actually
gasped
aloud
when
he
noticed
that
the
painting
in
Ariel's
underwater
home
was
none
other
than
seventeenth
century
artist
Georges
de
la
Tour's
The
Penitent
Magdalene
a
famous
homage
to
the
banished
Mary
Magdalene
fitting
decor
considering
the
movie
turned
out
to
be
a
ninety
minute
collage
of
blatant
symbolic
references
to
the
lost
sanctity
of
Isis,
Eve,
Pisces
the
fish
goddess,
and,
repeatedly,
Mary
Magdalene.
The
Little
Mermaid's
name,
Ariel,
possessed
powerful
ties
to
the
sacred
feminine
and,
in
the
Book
of
Isaiah,
was
synonymous
with
"the
Holy
City
besieged."
Of
course,
the
Little
Mermaid's
flowing
red
hair
was
certainly
no
coincidence
either.
The
clicking
of
Teabing's
crutches
approached
in
the
hallway,
his
pace
unusually
brisk.
When
their
host
entered
the
study,
his
expression
was
stern.
"You'd
better
explain
yourself,
Robert,"
he
said
coldly.
"You
have
not
been
honest
with
me."
"I'm
being
framed,
Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
trying
to
stay
calm.
You
know
me.
I
wouldn't
kill
anyone.
Teabing's
tone
did
not
soften.
"Robert,
you're
on
television,
for
Christ's
sake.
Did
you
know
you
were
wanted
by
the
authorities?"
"Yes."
"Then
you
abused
my
trust.
I'm
astonished
you
would
put
me
at
risk
by
coming
here
and
asking
me
to
ramble
on
about
the
Grail
so
you
could
hide
out
in
my
home."
"I
didn't
kill
anyone."
"Jacques
Sauniere
is
dead,
and
the
police
say
you
did
it."
Teabing
looked
saddened.
"Such
a
contributor
to
the
arts"
"Sir?"
The
manservant
had
appeared
now,
standing
behind
Teabing
in
the
study
doorway,
his
arms
crossed.
"Shall
I
show
them
out?"
"Allow
me."
Teabing
hobbled
across
the
study,
unlocked
a
set
of
wide
glass
doors,
and
swung
them
open
onto
a
side
lawn.
"Please
find
your
car,
and
leave."
Sophie
did
not
move.
"We
have
information
about
the
clef
de
voute.
The
Priory
keystone.
Teabing
stared
at
her
for
several
seconds
and
scoffed
derisively.
"A
desperate
ploy.
Robert
knows
how
I've
sought
it.
"She's
telling
the
truth,"
Langdon
said.
"That's
why
we
came
to
you
tonight.
To
talk
to
you
about
the
keystone.
The
manservant
intervened
now.
"Leave,
or
I
shall
call
the
authorities."
"Leigh,"
Langdon
whispered,
"we
know
where
it
is."
Teabing's
balance
seemed
to
falter
a
bit.
Remy
now
marched
stiffly
across
the
room.
"Leave
at
once!
Or
I
will
forcibly
"Remy!"
Teabing
spun,
snapping
at
his
servant.
"Excuse
us
for
a
moment."
The
servant's
jaw
dropped.
"Sir?
I
must
protest.
These
people
are
"I'll
handle
this."
Teabing
pointed
to
the
hallway.
After
a
moment
of
stunned
silence,
Remy
skulked
out
like
a
banished
dog.
In
the
cool
night
breeze
coming
through
the
open
doors,
Teabing
turned
back
to
Sophie
and
Langdon,
his
expression
still
wary.
"This
better
be
good.
What
do
you
know
of
the
keystone?"
In
the
thick
brush
outside
Teabing's
study,
Silas
clutched
his
pistol
and
gazed
through
the
glass
doors.
Only
moments
ago,
he
had
circled
the
house
and
seen
Langdon
and
the
woman
talking
in
the
large
study.
Before
he
could
move
in,
a
man
on
crutches
entered,
yelled
at
Langdon,
threw
open
the
doors,
and
demanded
his
guests
leave.
Then
the
woman
mentioned
the
keystone,
and
everything
changed.
Shouts
turned
to
whispers.
Moods
softened.
And
the
glass
doors
were
quickly
closed.
Now,
as
he
huddled
in
the
shadows,
Silas
peered
through
the
glass.
The
keystone
is
somewhere
inside
the
house.
Silas
could
feel
it.
Staying
in
the
shadows,
he
inched
closer
to
the
glass,
eager
to
hear
what
was
being
said.
He
would
give
them
five
minutes.
If
they
did
not
reveal
where
they
had
placed
the
keystone,
Silas
would
have
to
enter
and
persuade
them
with
force.
Inside
the
study,
Langdon
could
sense
their
host's
bewilderment.
"Grand
Master?"
Teabing
choked,
eyeing
Sophie.
"Jacques
Sauniere?"
Sophie
nodded,
seeing
the
shock
in
his
eyes.
"But
you
could
not
possibly
know
that!"
"Jacques
Sauniere
was
my
grandfather."
Teabing
staggered
back
on
his
crutches,
shooting
a
glance
at
Langdon,
who
nodded.
Teabing
turned
back
to
Sophie.
"Miss
Neveu,
I
am
speechless.
If
this
is
true,
then
I
am
truly
sorry
for
your
loss.
I
should
admit,
for
my
research,
I
have
kept
lists
of
men
in
Paris
whom
I
thought
might
be
good
candidates
for
involvement
in
the
Priory.
Jacques
Sauniere
was
on
that
list
along
with
many
others.
But
Grand
Master,
you
say?
It's
hard
to
fathom."
Teabing
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
shook
his
head.
"But
it
still
makes
no
sense.
Even
if
your
grandfather
were
the
Priory
Grand
Master
and
created
the
keystone
himself,
he
would
never
tell
you
how
to
find
it.
The
keystone
reveals
the
pathway
to
the
brotherhood's
ultimate
treasure.
Granddaughter
or
not,
you
are
not
eligible
to
receive
such
knowledge."
"Mr.
Sauniere
was
dying
when
he
passed
on
the
information,"
Langdon
said.
"He
had
limited
options."
"He
didn't
need
options,"
Teabing
argued.
"There
exist
three
senechaux
who
also
know
the
secret.
That
is
the
beauty
of
their
system.
One
will
rise
to
Grand
Master
and
they
will
induct
a
new
senechal
and
share
the
secret
of
the
keystone."
"I
guess
you
didn't
see
the
entire
news
broadcast,"
Sophie
said.
"In
addition
to
my
grandfather,
three
other
prominent
Parisians
were
murdered
today.
All
in
similar
ways.
All
looked
like
they
had
been
interrogated."
Teabing's
jaw
fell.
"And
you
think
they
were"
"The
senechaux,
"
Langdon
said.
"But
how?
A
murderer
could
not
possibly
learn
the
identities
of
all
four
top
members
of
the
Priory
of
Sion!
Look
at
me,
I
have
been
researching
them
for
decades,
and
I
can't
even
name
one
Priory
member.
It
seems
inconceivable
that
all
three
senechaux
and
the
Grand
Master
could
be
discovered
and
killed
in
one
day.
"I
doubt
the
information
was
gathered
in
a
single
day,"
Sophie
said.
"It
sounds
like
a
well
planned
decapiter.
It's
a
technique
we
use
to
fight
organized
crime
syndicates.
If
DCPJ
wants
to
move
on
a
certain
group,
they
will
silently
listen
and
watch
for
months,
identify
all
the
main
players,
and
then
move
in
and
take
them
all
at
the
same
moment.
Decapitation.
With
no
leadership,
the
group
falls
into
chaos
and
divulges
other
information.
It's
possible
someone
patiently
watched
the
Priory
and
then
attacked,
hoping
the
top
people
would
reveal
the
location
of
the
keystone."
Teabing
looked
unconvinced.
"But
the
brothers
would
never
talk.
They
are
sworn
to
secrecy.
Even
in
the
face
of
death."
"Exactly,"
Langdon
said.
"Meaning,
if
they
never
divulged
the
secret,
and
they
were
killed"
Teabing
gasped.
"Then
the
location
of
the
keystone
would
be
lost
forever!"
"And
with
it,"
Langdon
said,
"the
location
of
the
Holy
Grail."
Teabing's
body
seemed
to
sway
with
the
weight
of
Langdon's
words.
Then,
as
if
too
tired
to
stand
another
moment,
he
flopped
in
a
chair
and
stared
out
the
window.
Sophie
walked
over,
her
voice
soft.
"Considering
my
grandfather's
predicament,
it
seems
possible
that
in
total
desperation
he
tried
to
pass
the
secret
on
to
someone
outside
the
brotherhood.
Someone
he
thought
he
could
trust.
Someone
in
his
family."
Teabing
was
pale.
"But
someone
capable
of
such
an
attack
of
discovering
so
much
about
the
brotherhood"
He
paused,
radiating
a
new
fear.
"It
could
only
be
one
force.
This
kind
of
infiltration
could
only
have
come
from
the
Priory's
oldest
enemy."
Langdon
glanced
up.
"The
Church."
"Who
else?
Rome
has
been
seeking
the
Grail
for
centuries."
Sophie
was
skeptical.
"You
think
the
Church
killed
my
grandfather?"
Teabing
replied,
"It
would
not
be
the
first
time
in
history
the
Church
has
killed
to
protect
itself.
The
documents
that
accompany
the
Holy
Grail
are
explosive,
and
the
Church
has
wanted
to
destroy
them
for
years."
Langdon
was
having
trouble
buying
Teabing's
premise
that
the
Church
would
blatantly
murder
people
to
obtain
these
documents.
Having
met
the
new
Pope
and
many
of
the
cardinals,
Langdon
knew
they
were
deeply
spiritual
men
who
would
never
condone
assassination.
Regardless
of
the
stakes.
Sophie
seemed
to
be
having
similar
thoughts.
"Isn't
it
possible
that
these
Priory
members
were
murdered
by
someone
outside
the
Church?
Someone
who
didn't
understand
what
the
Grail
really
is?
The
Cup
of
Christ,
after
all,
would
be
quite
an
enticing
treasure.
Certainly
treasure
hunters
have
killed
for
less."
"In
my
experience,"
Teabing
said,
"men
go
to
far
greater
lengths
to
avoid
what
they
fear
than
to
obtain
what
they
desire.
I
sense
a
desperation
in
this
assault
on
the
Priory."
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
"the
argument
is
paradoxical.
Why
would
members
of
the
Catholic
clergy
murder
Priory
members
in
an
effort
to
find
and
destroy
documents
they
believe
are
false
testimony
anyway?"
Teabing
chuckled.
"The
ivory
towers
of
Harvard
have
made
you
soft,
Robert.
Yes,
the
clergy
in
Rome
are
blessed
with
potent
faith,
and
because
of
this,
their
beliefs
can
weather
any
storm,
including
documents
that
contradict
everything
they
hold
dear.
But
what
about
the
rest
of
the
world?
What
about
those
who
are
not
blessed
with
absolute
certainty?
What
about
those
who
look
at
the
cruelty
in
the
world
and
say,
where
is
God
today?
Those
who
look
at
Church
scandals
and
ask,
who
are
these
men
who
claim
to
speak
the
truth
about
Christ
and
yet
lie
to
cover
up
the
sexual
abuse
of
children
by
their
own
priests?"
Teabing
paused.
"What
happens
to
those
people,
Robert,
if
persuasive
scientific
evidence
comes
out
that
the
Church's
version
of
the
Christ
story
is
inaccurate,
and
that
the
greatest
story
ever
told
is,
in
fact,
the
greatest
story
ever
sold"
Langdon
did
not
respond.
"I'll
tell
you
what
happens
if
the
documents
get
out,"
Teabing
said.
"The
Vatican
faces
a
crisis
of
faith
unprecedented
in
its
two
millennia
history."
After
a
long
silence,
Sophie
said,
"But
if
it
is
the
Church
who
is
responsible
for
this
attack,
why
would
they
act
now?
After
all
these
years?
The
Priory
keeps
the
Sangreal
documents
hidden.
They
pose
no
immediate
threat
to
the
Church."
Teabing
heaved
an
ominous
sigh
and
glanced
at
Langdon.
"Robert,
I
assume
you
are
familiar
with
the
Priory's
final
charge?"
Langdon
felt
his
breath
catch
at
the
thought.
"I
am."
"Miss
Neveu,"
Teabing
said,
"the
Church
and
the
Priory
have
had
a
tacit
understanding
for
years.
That
is,
the
Church
does
not
attack
the
Priory,
and
the
Priory
keeps
the
Sangreal
documents
hidden."
He
paused.
"However,
part
of
the
Priory
history
has
always
included
a
plan
to
unveil
the
secret.
With
the
arrival
of
a
specific
date
in
history,
the
brotherhood
plans
to
break
the
silence
and
carry
out
its
ultimate
triumph
by
unveiling
the
Sangreal
documents
to
the
world
and
shouting
the
true
story
of
Jesus
Christ
from
the
mountaintops."
Sophie
stared
at
Teabing
in
silence.
Finally,
she
too
sat
down.
"And
you
think
that
date
is
approaching?
And
the
Church
knows
it?"
"A
speculation,"
Teabing
said,
"but
it
would
certainly
provide
the
Church
motivation
for
an
all
out
attack
to
find
the
documents
before
it
was
too
late.
Langdon
had
the
uneasy
feeling
that
Teabing
was
making
good
sense.
"Do
you
think
the
Church
would
actually
be
capable
of
uncovering
hard
evidence
of
the
Priory's
date?"
"Why
not
if
we're
assuming
the
Church
was
able
to
uncover
the
identities
of
the
Priory
members,
then
certainly
they
could
have
learned
of
their
plans.
And
even
if
they
don't
have
the
exact
date,
their
superstitions
may
be
getting
the
best
of
them."
"Superstitions?"
Sophie
asked.
"In
terms
of
prophecy,"
Teabing
said,
"we
are
currently
in
an
epoch
of
enormous
change.
The
millennium
has
recently
passed,
and
with
it
has
ended
the
two
thousand
year
long
astrological
Age
of
Pisces
the
fish,
which
is
also
the
sign
of
Jesus.
As
any
astrological
symbologist
will
tell
you,
the
Piscean
ideal
believes
that
man
must
be
told
what
to
do
by
higher
powers
because
man
is
incapable
of
thinking
for
himself.
Hence
it
has
been
a
time
of
fervent
religion.
Now,
however,
we
are
entering
the
Age
of
Aquarius
the
water
bearer
whose
ideals
claim
that
man
will
learn
the
truth
and
be
able
to
think
for
himself.
The
ideological
shift
is
enormous,
and
it
is
occurring
right
now."
Langdon
felt
a
shiver.
Astrological
prophecy
never
held
much
interest
or
credibility
for
him,
but
he
knew
there
were
those
in
the
Church
who
followed
it
very
closely.
"The
Church
calls
this
transitional
period
the
End
of
Days."
Sophie
looked
skeptical.
"As
in
the
end
of
the
world?
The
Apocalypse?"
"No."
Langdon
replied.
"That's
a
common
misconception.
Many
religions
speak
of
the
End
of
Days.
It
refers
not
to
the
end
of
the
world,
but
rather
the
end
of
our
current
age
Pisces,
which
began
at
the
time
of
Christ's
birth,
spanned
two
thousand
years,
and
waned
with
the
passing
of
the
millennium.
Now
that
we've
passed
into
the
Age
of
Aquarius,
the
End
of
Days
has
arrived."
"Many
Grail
historians,"
Teabing
added,
"believe
that
"the
Priory
is
indeed
planning
to
release
this
truth,
this
point
in
history
would
be
a
symbolically
apt
time.
Most
Priory
academics,
myself
included,
anticipated
the
brotherhood's
release
would
coincide
precisely
with
the
millennium.
Obviously,
it
did
not.
Admittedly,
the
Roman
calendar
does
not
mesh
perfectly
with
astrological
markers,
so
there
is
some
gray
area
in
the
prediction.
Whether
the
Church
now
has
inside
information
that
an
exact
date
is
looming,
or
whether
they
are
just
getting
nervous
on
account
of
astrological
prophecy,
I
don't
know.
Anyway,
it's
immaterial.
Either
scenario
explains
how
the
Church
might
be
motivated
to
launch
a
preemptive
attack
against
the
Priory."
Teabing
frowned.
"And
believe
me,
if
the
Church
finds
the
Holy
Grail,
they
will
destroy
it.
The
documents
and
the
relics
of
the
blessed
Mary
Magdalene
as
well."
His
eyes
grew
heavy.
"Then,
my
dear,
with
the
Sangreal
documents
gone,
all
evidence
will
be
lost.
The
Church
will
have
won
their
age
old
war
to
rewrite
history.
The
past
will
be
erased
forever."
Slowly,
Sophie
pulled
the
cruciform
key
from
her
sweater
pocket
and
held
it
out
to
Teabing.
Teabing
took
the
key
and
studied
it.
"My
goodness.
The
Priory
seal.
Where
did
you
get
this?"
"My
grandfather
gave
it
to
me
tonight
before
he
died."
Teabing
ran
his
fingers
across
the
cruciform.
"A
key
to
a
church?"
She
drew
a
deep
breath.
"This
key
provides
access
to
the
keystone."
Teabing's
head
snapped
up,
his
face
wild
with
disbelief.
"Impossible!
What
church
did
I
miss?
I've
searched
every
church
in
France!"
"It's
not
in
a
church,"
Sophie
said.
"It's
in
a
Swiss
depository
bank."
Teabing's
look
of
excitement
waned.
"The
keystone
is
in
a
bank?"
"A
vault,"
Langdon
offered.
"A
bank
vault?"
Teabing
shook
his
head
violently.
"That's
impossible.
The
keystone
is
supposed
to
be
hidden
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose."
"It
is,"
Langdon
said.
"It
was
stored
in
a
rosewood
box
inlaid
with
a
five
petal
Rose."
Teabing
looked
thunderstruck.
"You've
seen
the
keystone?"
Sophie
nodded.
"We
visited
the
bank."
Teabing
came
over
to
them,
his
eyes
wild
with
fear.
"My
friends,
we
must
do
something.
The
keystone
is
in
danger!
We
have
a
duty
to
protect
it.
What
if
there
are
other
keys?
Perhaps
stolen
from
the
murdered
senechaux?
If
the
Church
can
gain
access
to
the
bank
as
you
have
"Then
they
will
be
too
late,"
Sophie
said.
"We
removed
the
keystone."
"What!
You
removed
the
keystone
from
its
hiding
place?"
"Don't
worry,"
Langdon
said.
"The
keystone
is
well
hidden."
"Extremely
well
hidden,
I
hope
!
"Actually,"
Langdon
said,
unable
to
hide
his
grin,
"that
depends
on
how
often
you
dust
under
your
couch."
The
wind
outside
Chateau
Villette
had
picked
up,
and
Silas's
robe
danced
in
the
breeze
as
he
crouched
near
the
window.
Although
he
had
been
unable
to
hear
much
of
the
conversation,
the
word
keystone
had
sifted
through
the
glass
on
numerous
occasions.
It
is
inside.
The
Teacher's
words
were
fresh
in
his
mind.
Enter
Chateau
Villette.
Take
the
keystone.
Hun
no
one.
Now,
Langdon
and
the
others
had
adjourned
suddenly
to
another
room,
extinguishing
the
study
lights
as
they
went.
Feeling
like
a
panther
stalking
prey,
Silas
crept
to
the
glass
doors.
Finding
them
unlocked,
he
slipped
inside
and
closed
the
doors
silently
behind
him.
He
could
hear
muffled
voices
from
another
room.
Silas
pulled
the
pistol
from
his
pocket,
turned
off
the
safety,
and
inched
down
the
hallway.
Lieutenant
Collet
stood
alone
at
the
foot
of
Leigh
Teabing's
driveway
and
gazed
up
at
the
massive
house.
Isolated.
Dark.
Good
ground
cover.
Collet
watched
his
half
dozen
agents
spreading
silently
out
along
the
length
of
the
fence.
They
could
be
over
it
and
have
the
house
surrounded
in
a
matter
of
minutes.
Langdon
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
ideal
spot
for
Collet's
men
to
make
a
surprise
assault.
Collet
was
about
to
call
Fache
himself
when
at
last
his
phone
rang.
Fache
sounded
not
nearly
as
pleased
with
the
developments
as
Collet
would
have
imagined.
"Why
didn't
someone
tell
me
we
had
a
lead
on
Langdon?"
"You
were
on
a
phone
call
and
"Where
exactly
are
you,
Lieutenant
Collet?"
Collet
gave
him
the
address.
"The
estate
belongs
to
a
British
national
named
Teabing.
Langdon
drove
a
fair
distance
to
get
here,
and
the
vehicle
is
inside
the
security
gate,
with
no
signs
of
forced
entry,
so
chances
are
good
that
Langdon
knows
the
occupant."
"I'm
coming
out,"
Fache
said.
"Don't
make
a
move.
I'll
handle
this
personally."
Collet's
jaw
dropped.
"But
Captain,
you're
twenty
minutes
away!
We
should
act
immediately.
I
have
him
staked
out.
I'm
with
eight
men
total.
Four
of
us
have
field
rifles
and
the
others
have
sidearms."
"Wait
for
me."
"Captain,
what
if
Langdon
has
a
hostage
in
there?
What
if
he
sees
us
and
decides
to
leave
on
foot?
We
need
to
move
now!
My
men
are
in
position
and
ready
to
go."
"Lieutenant
Collet,
you
will
wait
for
me
to
arrive
before
taking
action.
That
is
an
order."
Fache
hung
up.
Stunned,
Lieutenant
Collet
switched
off
his
phone.
Why
the
hell
is
Fache
asking
me
to
wait?
Collet
knew
the
answer.
Fache,
though
famous
for
his
instinct,
was
notorious
for
his
pride.
Fache
wants
credit
for
the
arrest.
After
putting
the
American's
face
all
over
the
television,
Fache
wanted
to
be
sure
his
own
face
got
equal
time.
Collet's
job
was
simply
to
hold
down
the
fort
until
the
boss
showed
up
to
save
the
day.
As
he
stood
there,
Collet
flashed
on
a
second
possible
explanation
for
this
delay.
Damage
control.
In
law
enforcement,
hesitating
to
arrest
a
fugitive
only
occurred
when
uncertainty
had
arisen
regarding
the
suspect's
guilt.
Is
Fache
having
second
thoughts
that
Langdon
is
the
right
man
?
The
thought
was
frightening.
Captain
Fache
had
gone
out
on
a
limb
tonight
to
arrest
Robert
Langdon
surveillance
cachee,
Interpol,
and
now
television.
Not
even
the
great
Bezu
Fache
would
survive
the
political
fallout
if
he
had
mistakenly
splashed
a
prominent
American's
face
all
over
French
television,
claiming
he
was
a
murderer.
If
Fache
now
realized
he'd
made
a
mistake,
then
it
made
perfect
sense
that
he
would
tell
Collet
not
to
make
a
move.
The
last
thing
Fache
needed
was
for
Collet
to
storm
an
innocent
Brit's
private
estate
and
take
Langdon
at
gunpoint.
Moreover,
Collet
realized,
if
Langdon
were
innocent,
it
explained
one
of
this
case's
strangest
paradoxes:
Why
had
Sophie
Neveu,
the
granddaughter
of
the
victim,
helped
the
alleged
killer
escape?
Unless
Sophie
knew
Langdon
was
falsely
charged.
Fache
had
posited
all
kinds
of
explanations
tonight
to
explain
Sophie's
odd
behavior,
including
that
Sophie,
as
Sauniere's
sole
heir,
had
persuaded
her
secret
lover
Robert
Langdon
to
kill
off
Sauniere
for
the
inheritance
money.
Sauniere,
if
he
had
suspected
this,
might
have
left
the
police
the
message
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Collet
was
fairly
certain
something
else
was
going
on
here.
Sophie
Neveu
seemed
far
too
solid
of
character
to
be
mixed
up
in
something
that
sordid.
"Lieutenant?"
One
of
the
field
agents
came
running
over.
"We
found
a
car."
Collet
followed
the
agent
about
fifty
yards
past
the
driveway.
The
agent
pointed
to
a
wide
shoulder
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road.
There,
parked
in
the
brush,
almost
out
of
sight,
was
a
black
Audi.
It
had
rental
plates.
Collet
felt
the
hood.
Still
warm.
Hot
even.
"That
must
be
how
Langdon
got
here,"
Collet
said.
"Call
the
rental
company.
Find
out
if
it's
stolen."
"Yes,
sir."
Another
agent
waved
Collet
back
over
in
the
direction
of
the
fence.
"Lieutenant,
have
a
look
at
this."
He
handed
Collet
a
pair
of
night
vision
binoculars.
"The
grove
of
trees
near
the
top
of
the
driveway."
Collet
aimed
the
binoculars
up
the
hill
and
adjusted
the
image
intensifier
dials.
Slowly,
the
greenish
shapes
came
into
focus.
He
located
the
curve
of
the
driveway
and
slowly
followed
it
up,
reaching
the
grove
of
trees.
All
he
could
do
was
stare.
There,
shrouded
in
the
greenery,
was
an
armored
truck.
A
truck
identical
to
the
one
Collet
had
permitted
to
leave
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
earlier
tonight.
He
prayed
this
was
some
kind
of
bizarre
coincidence,
but
he
knew
it
could
not
be.
"It
seems
obvious,"
the
agent
said,
"that
this
truck
is
how
Langdon
and
Neveu
got
away
from
the
bank."
Collet
was
speechless.
He
thought
of
the
armored
truck
driver
he
had
stopped
at
the
roadblock.
The
Rolex.
His
impatience
to
leave.
never
checked
the
cargo
hold.
Incredulous,
Collet
realized
that
someone
in
the
bank
had
actually
lied
to
DCPJ
about
Langdon
and
Sophie's
whereabouts
and
then
helped
them
escape.
But
who?
And
why?
Collet
wondered
if
maybe
this
were
the
reason
Fache
had
told
him
not
to
take
action
yet.
Maybe
Fache
realized
there
were
more
people
involved
tonight
than
just
Langdon
and
Sophie.
And
if
Langdon
and
Neveu
arrived
in
the
armored
truck,
then
who
drove
the
Audi?
Hundreds
of
miles
to
the
south,
a
chartered
Beechcraft
Baron
58
raced
northward
over
the
Tyrrhenian
Sea.
Despite
calm
skies,
Bishop
Aringarosa
clutched
an
airsickness
bag,
certain
he
could
be
ill
at
any
moment.
His
conversation
with
Paris
had
not
at
all
been
what
he
had
imagined.
Alone
in
the
small
cabin,
Aringarosa
twisted
the
gold
ring
on
his
finger
and
tried
to
ease
his
overwhelming
sense
of
fear
and
desperation.
Everything
in
Paris
has
gone
terribly
wrong.
Closing
his
eyes,
Aringarosa
said
a
prayer
that
Bezu
Fache
would
have
the
means
to
fix
it.
Teabing
sat
on
the
divan,
cradling
the
wooden
box
on
his
lap
and
admiring
the
lid's
intricate
inlaid
Rose.
Tonight
has
become
the
strangest
and
most
magical
night
of
my
life.
"Lift
the
lid,"
Sophie
whispered,
standing
over
him,
beside
Langdon.
Teabing
smiled.
Do
not
rush
me.
Having
spent
over
a
decade
searching
for
this
keystone,
he
wanted
to
savor
every
millisecond
of
this
moment.
He
ran
a
palm
across
the
wooden
lid,
feeling
the
texture
of
the
inlaid
flower.
"The
Rose,"
he
whispered.
The
Rose
is
Magdalene
is
the
Holy
Grail.
The
Rose
is
the
compass
that
guides
the
way.
Teabing
felt
foolish.
For
years
he
had
traveled
to
cathedrals
and
churches
all
over
France,
paying
for
special
access,
examining
hundreds
of
archways
beneath
rose
windows,
searching
for
an
encrypted
keystone.
La
clef
de
voute
a
stone
key
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
Teabing
slowly
unlatched
the
lid
and
raised
it.
As
his
eyes
finally
gazed
upon
the
contents,
he
knew
in
an
instant
it
could
only
be
the
keystone.
He
was
staring
at
a
stone
cylinder,
crafted
of
interconnecting
lettered
dials.
The
device
seemed
surprisingly
familiar
to
him.
"Designed
from
Da
Vinci's
diaries,"
Sophie
said.
"My
grandfather
made
them
as
a
hobby."
Of
course,
Teabing
realized.
He
had
seen
the
sketches
and
blueprints.
The
key
to
finding
the
Holy
Grail
lies
inside
this
stone.
Teabing
lifted
the
heavy
cryptex
from
the
box,
holding
it
gently.
Although
he
had
no
idea
how
to
open
the
cylinder,
he
sensed
his
own
destiny
lay
inside.
In
moments
of
failure,
Teabing
had
questioned
whether
his
life's
quest
would
ever
be
rewarded.
Now
those
doubts
were
gone
forever.
He
could
hear
the
ancient
words
the
foundation
of
the
Grail
legend:
Vous
ne
trouvezpas
le
Saint
Graal,
c'est
le
Saint
Graal
qui
vous
trouve.
You
do
not
find
the
Grail,
the
Grail
finds
you.
And
tonight,
incredibly,
the
key
to
finding
the
Holy
Grail
had
walked
right
through
his
front
door.
While
Sophie
and
Teabing
sat
with
the
cryptex
and
talked
about
the
vinegar,
the
dials,
and
what
the
password
might
be,
Langdon
carried
the
rosewood
box
across
the
room
to
a
well
lit
table
to
get
a
better
look
at
it.
Something
Teabing
had
just
said
was
now
running
through
Langdon's
mind.
The
key
to
the
Grail
is
hidden
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
Langdon
held
the
wooden
box
up
to
the
light
and
examined
the
inlaid
symbol
of
the
Rose.
Although
his
familiarity
with
art
did
not
include
woodworking
or
inlaid
furniture,
he
had
just
recalled
the
famous
tiled
ceiling
of
the
Spanish
monastery
outside
of
Madrid,
where,
three
centuries
after
its
construction,
the
ceiling
tiles
began
to
fall
out,
revealing
sacred
texts
scrawled
by
monks
on
the
plaster
beneath.
Langdon
looked
again
at
the
Rose.
Beneath
the
Rose.
Sub
Rosa.
Secret.
A
bump
in
the
hallway
behind
him
made
Langdon
turn.
He
saw
nothing
but
shadows.
Teabing's
manservant
most
likely
had
passed
through.
Langdon
turned
back
to
the
box.
He
ran
his
finger
over
the
smooth
edge
of
the
inlay,
wondering
if
he
could
pry
the
Rose
out,
but
the
craftsmanship
was
perfect.
He
doubted
even
a
razor
blade
could
fit
in
between
the
inlaid
Rose
and
the
carefully
carved
depression
into
which
it
was
seated.
Opening
the
box,
he
examined
the
inside
of
the
lid.
It
was
smooth.
As
he
shifted
its
position,
though,
the
light
caught
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
hole
on
the
underside
of
the
lid,
positioned
in
the
exact
center.
Langdon
closed
the
lid
and
examined
the
inlaid
symbol
from
the
top.
No
hole.
It
doesn
't
pass
through.
Setting
the
box
on
the
table,
he
looked
around
the
room
and
spied
a
stack
of
papers
with
a
paper
clip
on
it.
Borrowing
the
clip,
he
returned
to
the
box,
opened
it,
and
studied
the
hole
again.
Carefully,
he
unbent
the
paper
clip
and
inserted
one
end
into
the
hole.
He
gave
a
gentle
push.
It
took
almost
no
effort.
He
heard
something
clatter
quietly
onto
the
table.
Langdon
closed
the
lid
to
look.
It
was
a
small
piece
of
wood,
like
a
puzzle
piece.
The
wooden
Rose
had
popped
out
of
the
lid
and
fallen
onto
the
desk.
Speechless,
Langdon
stared
at
the
bare
spot
on
the
lid
where
the
Rose
had
been.
There,
engraved
in
the
wood,
written
in
an
immaculate
hand,
were
four
lines
of
text
in
a
language
he
had
never
seen.
The
characters
look
vaguely
Semitic,
Langdon
thought
to
himself,
and
yet
I
don
't
recognize
the
language!
A
sudden
movement
behind
him
caught
his
attention.
Out
of
nowhere,
a
crushing
blow
to
the
head
knocked
Langdon
to
his
knees.
As
he
fell,
he
thought
for
a
moment
he
saw
a
pale
ghost
hovering
over
him,
clutching
a
gun.
Then
everything
went
black.
Sophie
Neveu,
despite
working
in
law
enforcement,
had
never
found
herself
at
gunpoint
until
tonight.
Almost
inconceivably,
the
gun
into
which
she
was
now
staring
was
clutched
in
the
pale
hand
of
an
enormous
albino
with
long
white
hair.
He
looked
at
her
with
red
eyes
that
radiated
a
frightening,
disembodied
quality.
Dressed
in
a
wool
robe
with
a
rope
tie,
he
resembled
a
medieval
cleric.
Sophie
could
not
imagine
who
he
was,
and
yet
she
was
feeling
a
sudden
newfound
respect
for
Teabing's
suspicions
that
the
Church
was
behind
this.
"You
know
what
I
have
come
for,"
the
monk
said,
his
voice
hollow.
Sophie
and
Teabing
were
seated
on
the
divan,
arms
raised
as
their
attacker
had
commanded.
Langdon
lay
groaning
on
the
floor.
The
monk's
eyes
fell
immediately
to
the
keystone
on
Teabing's
lap.
Teabing's
tone
was
defiant.
"You
will
not
be
able
to
open
it."
"My
Teacher
is
very
wise,"
the
monk
replied,
inching
closer,
the
gun
shifting
between
Teabing
and
Sophie.
Sophie
wondered
where
Teabing's
manservant
was.
Didn't
he
hear
Robert
fall?
"Who
is
your
teacher?"
Teabing
asked.
"Perhaps
we
can
make
a
financial
arrangement."
"The
Grail
is
priceless."
He
moved
closer.
"You're
bleeding,"
Teabing
noted
calmly,
nodding
to
the
monk's
right
ankle
where
a
trickle
of
blood
had
run
down
his
leg.
"And
you're
limping."
"As
do
you,"
the
monk
replied,
motioning
to
the
metal
crutches
propped
beside
Teabing.
"Now,
hand
me
the
keystone."
"You
know
of
the
keystone?"
Teabing
said,
sounding
surprised.
"Never
mind
what
I
know.
Stand
up
slowly,
and
give
it
to
me."
"Standing
is
difficult
for
me."
"Precisely.
I
would
prefer
nobody
attempt
any
quick
moves."
Teabing
slipped
his
right
hand
through
one
of
his
crutches
and
grasped
the
keystone
in
his
left.
Lurching
to
his
feet,
he
stood
erect,
palming
the
heavy
cylinder
in
his
left
hand,
and
leaning
unsteadily
on
his
crutch
with
his
right.
The
monk
closed
to
within
a
few
feet,
keeping
the
gun
aimed
directly
at
Teabing's
head.
Sophie
watched,
feeling
helpless
as
the
monk
reached
out
to
take
the
cylinder.
"You
will
not
succeed,"
Teabing
said.
"Only
the
worthy
can
unlock
this
stone."
God
alone
judges
the
worthy,
Silas
thought.
"It's
quite
heavy,"
the
man
on
crutches
said,
his
arm
wavering
now.
"If
you
don't
take
it
soon,
I'm
afraid
I
shall
drop
it!"
He
swayed
perilously.
Silas
stepped
quickly
forward
to
take
the
stone,
and
as
he
did,
the
man
on
crutches
lost
his
balance.
The
crutch
slid
out
from
under
him,
and
he
began
to
topple
sideways
to
his
right.
No!
Silas
lunged
to
save
the
stone,
lowering
his
weapon
in
the
process.
But
the
keystone
was
moving
away
from
him
now.
As
the
man
fell
to
his
right,
his
left
hand
swung
backward,
and
the
cylinder
tumbled
from
his
palm
onto
the
couch.
At
the
same
instant,
the
metal
crutch
that
had
been
sliding
out
from
under
the
man
seemed
to
accelerate,
cutting
a
wide
arc
through
the
air
toward
Silas's
leg.
Splinters
of
pain
tore
up
Silas's
body
as
the
crutch
made
perfect
contact
with
his
cilice,
crushing
the
barbs
into
his
already
raw
flesh.
Buckling,
Silas
crumpled
to
his
knees,
causing
the
belt
to
cut
deeper
still.
The
pistol
discharged
with
a
deafening
roar,
the
bullet
burying
itself
harmlessly
in
the
floorboards
as
Silas
fell.
Before
he
could
raise
the
gun
and
fire
again,
the
woman's
foot
caught
him
square
beneath
the
jaw.
At
the
bottom
of
the
driveway,
Collet
heard
the
gunshot.
The
muffled
pop
sent
panic
through
his
veins.
With
Fache
on
the
way,
Collet
had
already
relinquished
any
hopes
of
claiming
personal
credit
for
finding
Langdon
tonight.
But
Collet
would
be
damned
if
Fache's
ego
landed
him
in
front
of
a
Ministerial
Review
Board
for
negligent
police
procedure.
A
weapon
was
discharged
inside
a
private
home!
And
you
waited
at
the
bottom
of
the
driveway?
Collet
knew
the
opportunity
for
a
stealth
approach
had
long
since
passed.
He
also
knew
if
he
stood
idly
by
for
another
second,
his
entire
career
would
be
history
by
morning.
Eyeing
the
estate's
iron
gate,
he
made
his
decision.
"Tie
on,
and
pull
it
down."
In
the
distant
recesses
of
his
groggy
mind,
Robert
Langdon
had
heard
the
gunshot.
He'd
also
heard
a
scream
of
pain.
His
own?
A
jackhammer
was
boring
a
hole
into
the
back
of
his
cranium.
Somewhere
nearby,
people
were
talking.
"Where
the
devil
were
you?"
Teabing
was
yelling.
The
manservant
hurried
in.
"What
happened?
Oh
my
God!
Who
is
that?
I'll
call
the
police!"
"Bloody
hell!
Don't
call
the
police.
Make
yourself
useful
and
get
us
something
with
which
to
restrain
this
monster."
"And
some
ice!"
Sophie
called
after
him.
Langdon
drifted
out
again.
More
voices.
Movement.
Now
he
was
seated
on
the
divan.
Sophie
was
holding
an
ice
pack
to
his
head.
His
skull
ached.
As
Langdon's
vision
finally
began
to
clear,
he
found
himself
staring
at
a
body
on
the
floor.
Am
I
hallucinating?
The
massive
body
of
an
albino
monk
lay
bound
and
gagged
with
duct
tape.
His
chin
was
split
open,
and
the
robe
over
his
right
thigh
was
soaked
with
blood.
He
too
appeared
to
be
just
now
coming
to.
Langdon
turned
to
Sophie.
"Who
is
that?
What
happened?"
Teabing
hobbled
over.
"You
were
rescued
by
a
knight
brandishing
an
Excalibur
made
by
Acme
Orthopedic."
Huh?
Langdon
tried
to
sit
up.
Sophie's
touch
was
shaken
but
tender.
"Just
give
yourself
a
minute,
Robert."
"I
fear,"
Teabing
said,
"that
I've
just
demonstrated
for
your
lady
friend
the
unfortunate
benefit
of
my
condition.
It
seems
everyone
underestimates
you."
From
his
seat
on
the
divan,
Langdon
gazed
down
at
the
monk
and
tried
to
imagine
what
had
happened.
"He
was
wearing
a
cilice,
"
Teabing
explained.
"A
what?"
Teabing
pointed
to
a
bloody
strip
of
barbed
leather
that
lay
on
the
floor.
"A
Discipline
belt.
He
wore
it
on
his
thigh.
I
took
careful
aim."
Langdon
rubbed
his
head.
He
knew
of
Discipline
belts.
"But
how
did
you
know?"
Teabing
grinned.
"Christianity
is
my
field
of
study,
Robert,
and
there
are
certain
sects
who
wear
their
hearts
on
their
sleeves."
He
pointed
his
crutch
at
the
blood
soaking
through
the
monk's
cloak.
"As
it
were."
"Opus
Dei,"
Langdon
whispered,
recalling
recent
media
coverage
of
several
prominent
Boston
businessmen
who
were
members
of
Opus
Dei.
Apprehensive
coworkers
had
falsely
and
publicly
accused
the
men
of
wearing
Discipline
belts
beneath
their
three
piece
suits.
In
fact,
the
three
men
did
no
such
thing.
Like
many
members
of
Opus
Dei,
these
businessmen
were
at
the
"supernumerary"
stage
and
practiced
no
corporal
mortification
at
all.
They
were
devout
Catholics,
caring
fathers
to
their
children,
and
deeply
dedicated
members
of
the
community.
Not
surprisingly,
the
media
spotlighted
their
spiritual
commitment
only
briefly
before
moving
on
to
the
shock
value
of
the
sect's
more
stringent
"numerary"
members
members
like
the
monk
now
lying
on
the
floor
before
Langdon.
Teabing
was
looking
closely
at
the
bloody
belt.
"But
why
would
Opus
Dei
be
trying
to
find
the
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon
was
too
groggy
to
consider
it.
"Robert,"
Sophie
said,
walking
to
the
wooden
box.
"What's
this?"
She
was
holding
the
small
Rose
inlay
he
had
removed
from
the
lid.
"It
covered
an
engraving
on
the
box.
I
think
the
text
might
tell
us
how
to
open
the
keystone."
Before
Sophie
and
Teabing
could
respond,
a
sea
of
blue
police
lights
and
sirens
erupted
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
began
snaking
up
the
half
mile
driveway.
Teabing
frowned.
"My
friends,
it
seems
we
have
a
decision
to
make.
And
we'd
better
make
it
fast."
Collet
and
his
agents
burst
through
the
front
door
of
Sir
Leigh
Teabing's
estate
with
their
guns
drawn.
Fanning
out,
they
began
searching
all
the
rooms
on
the
first
level.
They
found
a
bullet
hole
in
the
drawing
room
floor,
signs
of
a
struggle,
a
small
amount
of
blood,
a
strange,
barbed
leather
belt,
and
a
partially
used
roll
of
duct
tape.
The
entire
level
seemed
deserted.
Just
as
Collet
was
about
to
divide
his
men
to
search
the
basement
and
grounds
behind
the
house,
he
heard
voices
on
the
level
above
them.
"They're
upstairs!"
Rushing
up
the
wide
staircase,
Collet
and
his
men
moved
room
by
room
through
the
huge
home,
securing
darkened
bedrooms
and
hallways
as
they
closed
in
on
the
sounds
of
voices.
The
sound
seemed
to
be
coming
from
the
last
bedroom
on
an
exceptionally
long
hallway.
The
agents
inched
down
the
corridor,
sealing
off
alternate
exits.
As
they
neared
the
final
bedroom,
Collet
could
see
the
door
was
wide
open.
The
voices
had
stopped
suddenly,
and
had
been
replaced
by
an
odd
rumbling,
like
an
engine.
Sidearm
raised,
Collet
gave
the
signal.
Reaching
silently
around
the
door
frame,
he
found
the
light
switch
and
flicked
it
on.
Spinning
into
the
room
with
men
pouring
in
after
him,
Collet
shouted
and
aimed
his
weapon
at
nothing.
An
empty
guest
bedroom.
Pristine.
The
rumbling
sounds
of
an
automobile
engine
poured
from
a
black
electronic
panel
on
the
wall
beside
the
bed.
Collet
had
seen
these
elsewhere
in
the
house.
Some
kind
of
intercom
system.
He
raced
over.
The
panel
had
about
a
dozen
labeled
buttons:
STUDY
KITCHEN
LAUNDRY
CELLAR
So
where
the
hell
do
I
hear
a
car?
MASTER
BEDROOM
SUN
ROOM
BARN
LIBRARY.
Barn!
Collet
was
downstairs
in
seconds,
running
toward
the
back
door,
grabbing
one
of
his
agents
on
the
way.
The
men
crossed
the
rear
lawn
and
arrived
breathless
at
the
front
of
a
weathered
gray
barn.
Even
before
they
entered,
Collet
could
hear
the
fading
sounds
of
a
car
engine.
He
drew
his
weapon,
rushed
in,
and
flicked
on
the
lights.
The
right
side
of
the
barn
was
a
rudimentary
workshop
lawn
mowers,
automotive
tools,
gardening
supplies.
A
familiar
intercom
panel
hung
on
the
wall
nearby.
One
of
its
buttons
was
flipped
down,
transmitting.
GUEST
BEDROOM
II.
Collet
wheeled,
anger
brimming.
They
lured
us
upstairs
with
the
intercom!
Searching
the
other
side
of
the
barn,
he
found
a
long
line
of
horse
stalls.
No
horses.
Apparently
the
owner
preferred
a
different
kind
of
horsepower;
the
stalls
had
been
converted
into
an
impressive
automotive
parking
facility.
The
collection
was
astonishing
a
black
Ferrari,
a
pristine
Rolls
Royce,
an
antique
Astin
Martin
sports
coupe,
a
vintage
Porsche
356.
The
last
stall
was
empty.
Collet
ran
over
and
saw
oil
stains
on
the
stall
floor.
They
can't
get
off
the
compound.
The
driveway
and
gate
were
barricaded
with
two
patrol
cars
to
prevent
this
very
situation.
"Sir?"
The
agent
pointed
down
the
length
of
the
stalls.
The
barn's
rear
slider
was
wide
open,
giving
way
to
a
dark,
muddy
slope
of
rugged
fields
that
stretched
out
into
the
night
behind
the
barn.
Collet
ran
to
the
door,
trying
to
see
out
into
the
darkness.
All
he
could
make
out
was
the
faint
shadow
of
a
forest
in
the
distance.
No
headlights.
This
wooded
valley
was
probably
crisscrossed
by
dozens
of
unmapped
fire
roads
and
hunting
trails,
but
Collet
was
confident
his
quarry
would
never
make
the
woods.
"Get
some
men
spread
out
down
there.
They're
probably
already
stuck
somewhere
nearby.
These
fancy
sports
cars
can't
handle
terrain."
"Urn,
sir?"
The
agent
pointed
to
a
nearby
pegboard
on
which
hung
several
sets
of
keys.
The
labels
above
the
keys
bore
familiar
names.
DAIMLER
ROLLS
ROYCE
ASTIN
MARTIN
PORSCHE
The
last
peg
was
empty.
When
Collet
read
the
label
above
the
empty
peg,
he
knew
he
was
in
trouble.
The
Range
Rover
was
Java
Black
Pearl,
four
wheel
drive,
standard
transmission,
with
high
strength
polypropylene
lamps,
rear
light
cluster
fittings,
and
the
steering
wheel
on
the
right.
Langdon
was
pleased
he
was
not
driving.
Teabing's
manservant
Remy,
on
orders
from
his
master,
was
doing
an
impressive
job
of
maneuvering
the
vehicle
across
the
moonlit
fields
behind
Chateau
Villette.
With
no
headlights,
he
had
crossed
an
open
knoll
and
was
now
descending
a
long
slope,
moving
farther
away
from
the
estate.
He
seemed
to
be
heading
toward
a
jagged
silhouette
of
wooded
land
in
the
distance.
Langdon,
cradling
the
keystone,
turned
in
the
passenger
seat
and
eyed
Teabing
and
Sophie
in
the
back
seat.
"How's
your
head,
Robert?"
Sophie
asked,
sounding
concerned.
Langdon
forced
a
pained
smile.
"Better,
thanks."
It
was
killing
him.
Beside
her,
Teabing
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
bound
and
gagged
monk
lying
in
the
cramped
luggage
area
behind
the
back
seat.
Teabing
had
the
monk's
gun
on
his
lap
and
looked
like
an
old
photo
of
a
British
safari
chap
posing
over
his
kill.
"So
glad
you
popped
in
this
evening,
Robert,"
Teabing
said,
grinning
as
if
he
were
having
fun
for
the
first
time
in
years.
"Sorry
to
get
you
involved
in
this,
Leigh."
"Oh,
please,
I've
waited
my
entire
life
to
be
involved."
Teabing
looked
past
Langdon
out
the
windshield
at
the
shadow
of
a
long
hedgerow.
He
tapped
Remy
on
the
shoulder
from
behind.
"Remember,
no
brake
lights.
Use
the
emergency
brake
if
you
need
it.
I
want
to
get
into
the
woods
a
bit.
No
reason
to
risk
them
seeing
us
from
the
house."
Remy
coasted
to
a
crawl
and
guided
the
Range
Rover
through
an
opening
in
the
hedge.
As
the
vehicle
lurched
onto
an
overgrown
pathway,
almost
immediately
the
trees
overhead
blotted
out
the
moonlight.
can
't
see
a
thing,
Langdon
thought,
straining
to
distinguish
any
shapes
at
all
in
front
of
them.
It
was
pitch
black.
Branches
rubbed
against
the
left
side
of
the
vehicle,
and
Remy
corrected
in
the
other
direction.
Keeping
the
wheel
more
or
less
straight
now,
he
inched
ahead
about
thirty
yards.
"You're
doing
beautifully,
Remy,"
Teabing
said.
"That
should
be
far
enough.
Robert,
if
you
could
press
that
little
blue
button
just
below
the
vent
there.
See
it?"
Langdon
found
the
button
and
pressed
it.
A
muted
yellow
glow
fanned
out
across
the
path
in
front
of
them,
revealing
thick
underbrush
on
either
side
of
the
pathway.
Fog
lights,
Langdon
realized.
They
gave
off
just
enough
light
to
keep
them
on
the
path,
and
yet
they
were
deep
enough
into
the
woods
now
that
the
lights
would
not
give
them
away.
"Well,
Remy,"
Teabing
chimed
happily.
"The
lights
are
on.
Our
lives
are
in
your
hands."
"Where
are
we
going?"
Sophie
asked.
"This
trail
continues
about
three
kilometers
into
the
forest,"
Teabing
said.
"Cutting
across
the
estate
and
then
arching
north.
Provided
we
don't
hit
any
standing
water
or
fallen
trees,
we
shall
emerge
unscathed
on
the
shoulder
of
highway
five."
Unscathed.
Langdon's
head
begged
to
differ.
He
turned
his
eyes
down
to
his
own
lap,
where
the
keystone
was
safely
stowed
in
its
wooden
box.
The
inlaid
Rose
on
the
lid
was
back
in
place,
and
although
his
head
felt
muddled,
Langdon
was
eager
to
remove
the
inlay
again
and
examine
the
engraving
beneath
more
closely.
He
unlatched
the
lid
and
began
to
raise
it
when
Teabing
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
from
behind.
"Patience,
Robert,"
Teabing
said.
"It's
bumpy
and
dark.
God
save
us
if
we
break
anything.
If
you
didn't
recognize
the
language
in
the
light,
you
won't
do
any
better
in
the
dark.
Let's
focus
on
getting
away
in
one
piece,
shall
we?
There
will
be
time
for
that
very
soon."
Langdon
knew
Teabing
was
right.
With
a
nod,
he
relatched
the
box.
The
monk
in
back
was
moaning
now,
struggling
against
his
trusses.
Suddenly,
he
began
kicking
wildly.
Teabing
spun
around
and
aimed
the
pistol
over
the
seat.
"I
can't
imagine
your
complaint,
sir.
You
trespassed
in
my
home
and
planted
a
nasty
welt
on
the
skull
of
a
dear
friend.
I
would
be
well
within
my
rights
to
shoot
you
right
now
and
leave
you
to
rot
in
the
woods."
The
monk
fell
silent.
"Are
you
sure
we
should
have
brought
him?"
Langdon
asked.
"Bloody
well
positive!"
Teabing
exclaimed.
"You're
wanted
for
murder,
Robert.
This
scoundrel
is
your
ticket
to
freedom.
The
police
apparently
want
you
badly
enough
to
have
tailed
you
to
my
home."
"My
fault,"
Sophie
said.
"The
armored
car
probably
had
a
transmitter."
"Not
the
point,"
Teabing
said.
"I'm
not
surprised
the
police
found
you,
but
I
am
surprised
that
this
Opus
Dei
character
found
you.
From
all
you've
told
me,
I
can't
imagine
how
this
man
could
have
tailed
you
to
my
home
unless
he
had
a
contact
either
within
the
Judicial
Police
or
within
the
Zurich
Depository."
Langdon
considered
it.
Bezu
Fache
certainly
seemed
intent
on
finding
a
scapegoat
for
tonight's
murders.
And
Vernet
had
turned
on
them
rather
suddenly,
although
considering
Langdon
was
being
charged
with
four
murders,
the
banker's
change
of
heart
seemed
understandable.
"This
monk
is
not
working
alone,
Robert,"
Teabing
said,
"and
until
you
learn
who
is
behind
all
this,
you
both
are
in
danger.
The
good
news,
my
friend,
is
that
you
are
now
in
the
position
of
power.
This
monster
behind
me
holds
that
information,
and
whoever
is
pulling
his
strings
has
got
to
be
quite
nervous
right
now."
Remy
was
picking
up
speed,
getting
comfortable
with
the
trail.
They
splashed
through
some
water,
climbed
a
small
rise,
and
began
descending
again.
"Robert,
could
you
be
so
kind
as
to
hand
me
that
phone?"
Teabing
pointed
to
the
car
phone
on
the
dash.
Langdon
handed
it
back,
and
Teabing
dialed
a
number.
He
waited
for
a
very
long
time
before
someone
answered.
"Richard?
Did
I
wake
you?
Of
course,
I
did.
Silly
question.
I'm
sorry.
I
have
a
small
problem.
I'm
feeling
a
bit
off.
Remy
and
I
need
to
pop
up
to
the
Isles
for
my
treatments.
Well,
right
away,
actually.
Sorry
for
the
short
notice.
Can
you
have
Elizabeth
ready
in
about
twenty
minutes?
I
know,
do
the
best
you
can.
See
you
shortly."
He
hung
up.
"Elizabeth?"
Langdon
said.
"My
plane.
She
cost
me
a
Queen's
ransom."
Langdon
turned
full
around
and
looked
at
him.
"What?"
Teabing
demanded.
"You
two
can't
expect
to
stay
in
France
with
the
entire
Judicial
Police
after
you.
London
will
be
much
safer."
Sophie
had
turned
to
Teabing
as
well.
"You
think
we
should
leave
the
country?"
"My
friends,
I
am
far
more
influential
in
the
civilized
world
than
here
in
France.
Furthermore,
the
Grail
is
believed
to
be
in
Great
Britain.
If
we
unlock
the
keystone,
I
am
certain
we
will
discover
a
map
that
indicates
we
have
moved
in
the
proper
direction."
"You're
running
a
big
risk,"
Sophie
said,
"by
helping
us.
You
won't
make
any
friends
with
the
French
police."
Teabing
gave
a
wave
of
disgust.
"I
am
finished
with
France.
I
moved
here
to
find
the
keystone.
That
work
is
now
done.
I
shan't
care
if
I
ever
again
see
Chateau
Villette."
Sophie
sounded
uncertain.
"How
will
we
get
through
airport
security?"
Teabing
chuckled.
"I
fly
from
Le
Bourget
an
executive
airfield
not
far
from
here.
French
doctors
make
me
nervous,
so
every
fortnight,
I
fly
north
to
take
my
treatments
in
England.
I
pay
for
certain
special
privileges
at
both
ends.
Once
we're
airborne,
you
can
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
you'd
like
someone
from
the
U.S.
Embassy
to
meet
us."
Langdon
suddenly
didn't
want
anything
to
do
with
the
embassy.
All
he
could
think
of
was
the
keystone,
the
inscription,
and
whether
it
would
all
lead
to
the
Grail.
He
wondered
if
Teabing
was
right
about
Britain.
Admittedly
most
modern
legends
placed
the
Grail
somewhere
in
the
United
Kingdom.
Even
King
Arthur's
mythical,
Grail
rich
Isle
of
Avalon
was
now
believed
to
be
none
other
than
Glastonbury,
England.
Wherever
the
Grail
lay,
Langdon
never
imagined
he
would
actually
be
looking
for
it.
The
Sangreal
documents.
The
true
history
of
Jesus
Christ.
The
tomb
of
Mary
Magdalene.
He
suddenly
felt
as
if
he
were
living
in
some
kind
of
limbo
tonight
a
bubble
where
the
real
world
could
not
reach
him.
"Sir?"
Remy
said.
"Are
you
truly
thinking
of
returning
to
England
for
good?"
"Remy,
you
needn't
worry,"
Teabing
assured.
"Just
because
I
am
returning
to
the
Queen's
realm
does
not
mean
I
intend
to
subject
my
palate
to
bangers
and
mash
for
the
rest
of
my
days.
I
expect
you
will
join
me
there
permanently.
I'm
planning
to
buy
a
splendid
villa
in
Devonshire,
and
we'll
have
all
your
things
shipped
up
immediately.
An
adventure,
Remy.
I
say,
an
adventure!"
Langdon
had
to
smile.
As
Teabing
railed
on
about
his
plans
for
a
triumphant
return
to
Britain,
Langdon
felt
himself
caught
up
in
the
man's
infectious
enthusiasm.
Gazing
absently
out
the
window,
Langdon
watched
the
woods
passing
by,
ghostly
pale
in
the
yellow
blush
of
the
fog
lights.
The
side
mirror
was
tipped
inward,
brushed
askew
by
branches,
and
Langdon
saw
the
reflection
of
Sophie
sitting
quietly
in
the
back
seat.
He
watched
her
for
a
long
while
and
felt
an
unexpected
upwelling
of
contentment.
Despite
his
troubles
tonight,
Langdon
was
thankful
to
have
landed
in
such
good
company.
After
several
minutes,
as
if
suddenly
sensing
his
eyes
on
her,
Sophie
leaned
forward
and
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders,
giving
him
a
quick
rub.
"You
okay?"
"Yeah,"
Langdon
said.
"Somehow."
Sophie
sat
back
in
her
seat,
and
Langdon
saw
a
quiet
smile
cross
her
lips.
He
realized
that
he
too
was
now
grinning.
Wedged
in
the
back
of
the
Range
Rover,
Silas
could
barely
breathe.
His
arms
were
wrenched
backward
and
heavily
lashed
to
his
ankles
with
kitchen
twine
and
duct
tape.
Every
bump
in
the
road
sent
pain
shooting
through
his
twisted
shoulders.
At
least
his
captors
had
removed
the
cilice.
Unable
to
inhale
through
the
strip
of
tape
over
his
mouth,
he
could
only
breathe
through
his
nostrils,
which
were
slowly
clogging
up
due
to
the
dusty
rear
cargo
area
into
which
he
had
been
crammed.
He
began
coughing.
"I
think
he's
choking,"
the
French
driver
said,
sounding
concerned.
The
British
man
who
had
struck
Silas
with
his
crutch
now
turned
and
peered
over
the
seat,
frowning
coldly
at
Silas.
"Fortunately
for
you,
we
British
judge
man's
civility
not
by
his
compassion
for
his
friends,
but
by
his
compassion
for
his
enemies."
The
Brit
reached
down
and
grabbed
the
duct
tape
on
Silas's
mouth.
In
one
fast
motion,
he
tore
it
off.
Silas
felt
as
if
his
lips
had
just
caught
fire,
but
the
air
pouring
into
his
lungs
was
sent
from
God.
"Whom
do
you
work
for?"
the
British
man
demanded.
"I
do
the
work
of
God,"
Silas
spat
back
through
the
pain
in
his
jaw
where
the
woman
had
kicked
him.
"You
belong
to
Opus
Dei,"
the
man
said.
It
was
not
a
question.
"You
know
nothing
of
who
I
am."
"Why
does
Opus
Dei
want
the
keystone?"
Silas
had
no
intention
of
answering.
The
keystone
was
the
link
to
the
Holy
Grail,
and
the
Holy
Grail
was
the
key
to
protecting
the
faith.
do
the
work
of
God.
The
Way
is
in
peril.
Now,
in
the
Range
Rover,
struggling
against
his
bonds,
Silas
feared
he
had
failed
the
Teacher
and
the
bishop
forever.
He
had
no
way
even
to
contact
them
and
tell
them
the
terrible
turn
of
events.
My
captors
have
the
keystone!
They
will
reach
the
Grail
before
we
do!
In
the
stifling
darkness,
Silas
prayed.
He
let
the
pain
of
his
body
fuel
his
supplications.
A
miracle,
Lord.
I
need
a
miracle.
Silas
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
hours
from
now,
he
would
get
one.
"Robert?"
Sophie
was
still
watching
him.
"A
funny
look
just
crossed
your
face."
Langdon
glanced
back
at
her,
realizing
his
jaw
was
firmly
set
and
his
heart
was
racing.
An
incredible
notion
had
just
occurred
to
him.
Could
it
really
be
that
simple
an
explanation?
"I
need
to
use
your
cell
phone,
Sophie."
"Now?"
"I
think
I
just
figured
something
out."
"What?"
"I'll
tell
you
in
a
minute.
I
need
your
phone."
Sophie
looked
wary.
"I
doubt
Fache
is
tracing,
but
keep
it
under
a
minute
just
in
case."
She
gave
him
her
phone.
"How
do
I
dial
the
States?"
"You
need
to
reverse
the
charges.
My
service
doesn't
cover
transatlantic."
Langdon
dialed
zero,
knowing
that
the
next
sixty
seconds
might
answer
a
question
that
had
been
puzzling
him
all
night.
New
York
editor
Jonas
Faukman
had
just
climbed
into
bed
for
the
night
when
the
telephone
rang.
A
little
late
for
callers,
he
grumbled,
picking
up
the
receiver.
An
operator's
voice
asked
him,
"Will
you
accept
charges
for
a
collect
call
from
Robert
Langdon?"
Puzzled,
Jonas
turned
on
the
light.
"Uh
sure,
okay."
The
line
clicked.
"Jonas?"
"Robert?
You
wake
me
up
and
you
charge
me
for
it?"
"Jonas,
forgive
me,"
Langdon
said.
"I'll
keep
this
very
short.
I
really
need
to
know.
The
manuscript
I
gave
you.
Have
you
"Robert,
I'm
sorry,
I
know
I
said
I'd
send
the
edits
out
to
you
this
week,
but
I'm
swamped.
Next
Monday.
I
promise."
"I'm
not
worried
about
the
edits.
I
need
to
know
if
you
sent
any
copies
out
for
blurbs
without
telling
me?"
Faukman
hesitated.
Langdon's
newest
manuscript
an
exploration
of
the
history
of
goddess
worship
included
several
sections
about
Mary
Magdalene
that
were
going
to
raise
some
eyebrows.
Although
the
material
was
well
documented
and
had
been
covered
by
others,
Faukman
had
no
intention
of
printing
Advance
Reading
Copies
of
Langdon's
book
without
at
least
a
few
endorsements
from
serious
historians
and
art
luminaries.
Jonas
had
chosen
ten
big
names
in
the
art
world
and
sent
them
all
sections
of
the
manuscript
along
with
a
polite
letter
asking
if
they
would
be
willing
to
write
a
short
endorsement
for
the
jacket.
In
Faukman's
experience,
most
people
jumped
at
the
opportunity
to
see
their
name
in
print.
"Jonas?"
Langdon
pressed.
"You
sent
out
my
manuscript,
didn't
you?"
Faukman
frowned,
sensing
Langdon
was
not
happy
about
it.
"The
manuscript
was
clean,
Robert,
and
I
wanted
to
surprise
you
with
some
terrific
blurbs."
A
pause.
"Did
you
send
one
to
the
curator
of
the
Paris
Louvre?"
"What
do
you
think?
Your
manuscript
referenced
his
Louvre
collection
several
times,
his
books
are
in
your
bibliography,
and
the
guy
has
some
serious
clout
for
foreign
sales.
Sauniere
was
a
no
brainer.
The
silence
on
the
other
end
lasted
a
long
time.
"When
did
you
send
it?"
"About
a
month
ago.
I
also
mentioned
you
would
be
in
Paris
soon
and
suggested
you
two
chat.
Did
he
ever
call
you
to
meet?"
Faukman
paused,
rubbing
his
eyes.
"Hold
on,
aren't
you
supposed
to
be
in
Paris
this
week?"
"lam
in
Paris."
Faukman
sat
upright.
"You
called
me
collect
from
Paris?"
"Take
it
out
of
my
royalties,
Jonas.
Did
you
ever
hear
back
from
Sauniere?
Did
he
like
the
manuscript?"
"I
don't
know.
I
haven't
yet
heard
from
him."
"Well,
don't
hold
your
breath.
I've
got
to
run,
but
this
explains
a
lot
Thanks."
"Robert"
But
Langdon
was
gone.
Faukman
hung
up
the
phone,
shaking
his
head
in
disbelief
Authors,
he
thought.
Even
the
sane
ones
are
nuts.
Inside
the
Range
Rover,
Leigh
Teabing
let
out
a
guffaw.
"Robert,
you're
saying
you
wrote
a
manuscript
that
delves
into
a
secret
society,
and
your
editor
sent
a
copy
to
that
secret
society?"
Langdon
slumped.
"Evidently."
"A
cruel
coincidence,
my
friend."
Coincidence
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
Langdon
knew.
Asking
Jacques
Sauniere
to
endorse
a
manuscript
on
goddess
worship
was
as
obvious
as
asking
Tiger
Woods
to
endorse
a
book
on
golf.
Moreover,
it
was
virtually
guaranteed
that
any
book
on
goddess
worship
would
have
to
mention
the
Priory
of
Sion.
"Here's
the
million
dollar
question,"
Teabing
said,
still
chuckling.
"Was
your
position
on
the
Priory
favorable
or
unfavorable?"
Langdon
could
hear
Teabing's
true
meaning
loud
and
clear.
Many
historians
questioned
why
the
Priory
was
still
keeping
the
Sangreal
documents
hidden.
Some
felt
the
information
should
have
been
shared
with
the
world
long
ago.
"I
took
no
position
on
the
Priory's
actions."
"You
mean
lack
thereof."
Langdon
shrugged.
Teabing
was
apparently
on
the
side
of
making
the
documents
public.
"I
simply
provided
history
on
the
brotherhood
and
described
them
as
a
modern
goddess
worship
society,
keepers
of
the
Grail,
and
guardians
of
ancient
documents."
Sophie
looked
at
him.
"Did
you
mention
the
keystone?"
Langdon
winced.
He
had.
Numerous
times.
"I
talked
about
the
supposed
keystone
as
an
example
of
the
lengths
to
which
the
Priory
would
go
to
protect
the
Sangreal
documents."
Sophie
looked
amazed.
"I
guess
that
explains
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Langdon
sensed
it
was
actually
something
else
in
the
manuscript
that
had
piqued
Sauniere's
interest,
but
that
topic
was
something
he
would
discuss
with
Sophie
when
they
were
alone.
"So,"
Sophie
said,
"you
lied
to
Captain
Fache."
"What?"
Langdon
demanded.
"You
told
him
you
had
never
corresponded
with
my
grandfather."
"I
didn't!
My
editor
sent
him
a
manuscript."
"Think
about
it,
Robert.
If
Captain
Fache
didn't
find
the
envelope
in
which
your
editor
sent
the
manuscript,
he
would
have
to
conclude
that
you
sent
it."
She
paused.
"Or
worse,
that
you
hand
delivered
it
and
lied
about
it.
When
the
Range
Rover
arrived
at
Le
Bourget
Airfield,
Remy
drove
to
a
small
hangar
at
the
far
end
of
the
airstrip.
As
they
approached,
a
tousled
man
in
wrinkled
khakis
hurried
from
the
hangar,
waved,
and
slid
open
the
enormous
corrugated
metal
door
to
reveal
a
sleek
white
jet
within.
Langdon
stared
at
the
glistening
fuselage.
"That's
Elizabeth?"
Teabing
grinned.
"Beats
the
bloody
Chunnel."
The
man
in
khakis
hurried
toward
them,
squinting
into
the
headlights.
"Almost
ready,
sir,"
he
called
in
a
British
accent.
"My
apologies
for
the
delay,
but
you
took
me
by
surprise
and
"
He
stopped
short
as
the
group
unloaded.
He
looked
at
Sophie
and
Langdon,
and
then
Teabing.
Teabing
said,
"My
associates
and
I
have
urgent
business
in
London.
We've
no
time
to
waste.
Please
prepare
to
depart
immediately."
As
he
spoke,
Teabing
took
the
pistol
out
of
the
vehicle
and
handed
it
to
Langdon.
The
pilot's
eyes
bulged
at
the
sight
of
the
weapon.
He
walked
over
to
Teabing
and
whispered,
"Sir,
my
humble
apologies,
but
my
diplomatic
flight
allowance
provides
only
for
you
and
your
manservant.
I
cannot
take
your
guests."
"Richard,"
Teabing
said,
smiling
warmly,
"two
thousand
pounds
sterling
and
that
loaded
gun
say
you
can
take
my
guests."
He
motioned
to
the
Range
Rover.
"And
the
unfortunate
fellow
in
the
back."
The
Hawker
731's
twin
Garrett
TFE
731
engines
thundered,
powering
the
plane
skyward
with
gut
wrenching
force.
Outside
the
window,
Le
Bourget
Airfield
dropped
away
with
startling
speed.
I'm
fleeing
the
country,
Sophie
thought,
her
body
forced
back
into
the
leather
seat.
Until
this
moment,
she
had
believed
her
game
of
cat
and
mouse
with
Fache
would
be
somehow
justifiable
to
the
Ministry
of
Defense.
was
attempting
to
protect
an
innocent
man.
I
was
trying
to
fulfill
my
grandfather's
dying
wishes.
That
window
of
opportunity,
Sophie
knew,
had
just
closed.
She
was
leaving
the
country,
without
documentation,
accompanying
a
wanted
man,
and
transporting
a
bound
hostage.
If
a
"line
of
reason"
had
ever
existed,
she
had
just
crossed
it.
At
almost
the
speed
of
sound.
Sophie
was
seated
with
Langdon
and
Teabing
near
the
front
of
the
cabin
the
Fan
Jet
Executive
Elite
Design,
according
to
the
gold
medallion
on
the
door.
Their
plush
swivel
chairs
were
bolted
to
tracks
on
the
floor
and
could
be
repositioned
and
locked
around
a
rectangular
hardwood
table.
A
mini
boardroom.
The
dignified
surroundings,
however,
did
little
to
camouflage
the
less
than
dignified
state
of
affairs
in
the
rear
of
the
plane
where,
in
a
separate
seating
area
near
the
rest
room,
Teabing's
manservant
Remy
sat
with
the
pistol
in
hand,
begrudgingly
carrying
out
Teabing's
orders
to
stand
guard
over
the
bloody
monk
who
lay
trussed
at
his
feet
like
a
piece
of
luggage.
"Before
we
turn
our
attention
to
the
keystone,"
Teabing
said,
"I
was
wondering
if
you
would
permit
me
a
few
words."
He
sounded
apprehensive,
like
a
father
about
to
give
the
birds
and
the
bees
lecture
to
his
children.
"My
friends,
I
realize
I
am
but
a
guest
on
this
journey,
and
I
am
honored
as
such.
And
yet,
as
someone
who
has
spent
his
life
in
search
of
the
Grail,
I
feel
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
you
are
about
to
step
onto
a
path
from
which
there
is
no
return,
regardless
of
the
dangers
involved."
He
turned
to
Sophie.
"Miss
Neveu,
your
grandfather
gave
you
this
cryptex
in
hopes
you
would
keep
the
secret
of
the
Holy
Grail
alive."
"Yes."
"Understandably,
you
feel
obliged
to
follow
the
trail
wherever
it
leads."
Sophie
nodded,
although
she
felt
a
second
motivation
still
burning
within
her.
The
truth
about
my
family.
Despite
Langdon's
assurances
that
the
keystone
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
past,
Sophie
still
sensed
something
deeply
personal
entwined
within
this
mystery,
as
if
this
cryptex,
forged
by
her
grandfather's
own
hands,
were
trying
to
speak
to
her
and
offer
some
kind
of
resolution
to
the
emptiness
that
had
haunted
her
all
these
years.
"Your
grandfather
and
three
others
died
tonight,"
Teabing
continued,
"and
they
did
so
to
keep
this
keystone
away
from
the
Church.
Opus
Dei
came
within
inches
tonight
of
possessing
it.
You
understand,
I
hope,
that
this
puts
you
in
a
position
of
exceptional
responsibility.
You
have
been
handed
a
torch.
A
two
thousand
year
old
flame
that
cannot
be
allowed
to
go
out.
This
torch
cannot
fall
into
the
wrong
hands."
He
paused,
glancing
at
the
rosewood
box.
"I
realize
you
have
been
given
no
choice
in
this
matter,
Miss
Neveu,
but
considering
what
is
at
stake
here,
you
must
either
fully
embrace
this
responsibility
or
you
must
pass
that
responsibility
to
someone
else."
"My
grandfather
gave
the
cryptex
to
me.
I'm
sure
he
thought
I
could
handle
the
responsibility."
Teabing
looked
encouraged
but
unconvinced.
"Good.
A
strong
will
is
necessary.
And
yet,
I
am
curious
if
you
understand
that
successfully
unlocking
the
keystone
will
bring
with
it
a
far
greater
trial."
"How
so?"
"My
dear,
imagine
that
you
are
suddenly
holding
a
map
that
reveals
the
location
of
the
Holy
Grail.
In
that
moment,
you
will
be
in
possession
of
a
truth
capable
of
altering
history
forever.
You
will
be
the
keeper
of
a
truth
that
man
has
sought
for
centuries.
You
will
be
faced
with
the
responsibility
of
revealing
that
truth
to
the
world.
The
individual
who
does
so
will
be
revered
by
many
and
despised
by
many.
The
question
is
whether
you
will
have
the
necessary
strength
to
carry
out
that
task."
Sophie
paused.
"I'm
not
sure
that
is
my
decision
to
make."
Teabing's
eyebrows
arched.
"No?
If
not
the
possessor
of
the
keystone,
then
who?"
"The
brotherhood
who
has
successfully
protected
the
secret
for
so
long."
"The
Priory?"
Teabing
looked
skeptical.
"But
how?
The
brotherhood
was
shattered
tonight.
Decapitated,
as
you
so
aptly
put
it.
Whether
they
were
infiltrated
by
some
kind
of
eavesdropping
or
by
a
spy
within
their
ranks,
we
will
never
know,
but
the
fact
remains
that
someone
got
to
them
and
uncovered
the
identities
of
their
four
top
members.
I
would
not
trust
anyone
who
stepped
forward
from
the
brotherhood
at
this
point."
"So
what
do
you
suggest?"
Langdon
asked.
"Robert,
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
that
the
Priory
has
not
protected
the
truth
all
these
years
to
have
it
gather
dust
until
eternity.
They
have
been
waiting
for
the
right
moment
in
history
to
share
their
secret.
A
time
when
the
world
is
ready
to
handle
the
truth."
"And
you
believe
that
moment
has
arrived?"
Langdon
asked.
"Absolutely.
It
could
not
be
more
obvious.
All
the
historical
signs
are
in
place,
and
if
the
Priory
did
not
intend
to
make
their
secret
known
very
soon,
why
has
the
Church
now
attacked?"
Sophie
argued,
"The
monk
has
not
yet
told
us
his
purpose."
"The
monk's
purpose
is
the
Church's
purpose,"
Teabing
replied,
"to
destroy
the
documents
that
reveal
the
great
deception.
The
Church
came
closer
tonight
than
they
have
ever
come,
and
the
Priory
has
put
its
trust
in
you,
Miss
Neveu.
The
task
of
saving
the
Holy
Grail
clearly
includes
carrying
out
the
Priory's
final
wishes
of
sharing
the
truth
with
the
world.
Langdon
intervened.
"Leigh,
asking
Sophie
to
make
that
decision
is
quite
a
load
to
drop
on
someone
who
only
an
hour
ago
learned
the
Sangreal
documents
exist."
Teabing
sighed.
"I
apologize
if
I
am
pressing,
Miss
Neveu.
Clearly
I
have
always
believed
these
documents
should
be
made
public,
but
in
the
end
the
decision
belongs
to
you.
I
simply
feel
it
is
important
that
you
begin
to
think
about
what
happens
should
we
succeed
in
opening
the
keystone."
"Gentlemen,"
Sophie
said,
her
voice
firm.
"To
quote
your
words,
'You
do
not
find
the
Grail,
the
Grail
finds
you.'
I
am
going
to
trust
that
the
Grail
has
found
me
for
a
reason,
and
when
the
time
comes,
I
will
know
what
to
do."
Both
of
them
looked
startled.
"So
then,"
she
said,
motioning
to
the
rosewood
box.
"Let's
move
on.
Standing
in
the
drawing
room
of
Chateau
Villette,
Lieutenant
Collet
watched
the
dying
fire
and
felt
despondent.
Captain
Fache
had
arrived
moments
earlier
and
was
now
in
the
next
room,
yelling
into
the
phone,
trying
to
coordinate
the
failed
attempt
to
locate
the
missing
Range
Rover.
It
could
be
anywhere
by
now,
Collet
thought.
Having
disobeyed
Fache's
direct
orders
and
lost
Langdon
for
a
second
time,
Collet
was
grateful
that
PTS
had
located
a
bullet
hole
in
the
floor,
which
at
least
corroborated
Collet's
claims
that
a
shot
had
been
fired.
Still,
Fache's
mood
was
sour,
and
Collet
sensed
there
would
be
dire
repercussions
when
the
dust
settled.
Unfortunately,
the
clues
they
were
turning
up
here
seemed
to
shed
no
light
at
all
on
what
was
going
on
or
who
was
involved.
The
black
Audi
outside
had
been
rented
in
a
false
name
with
false
credit
card
numbers,
and
the
prints
in
the
car
matched
nothing
in
the
Interpol
database.
Another
agent
hurried
into
the
living
room,
his
eyes
urgent.
"Where's
Captain
Fache?"
Collet
barely
looked
up
from
the
burning
embers.
"He's
on
the
phone."
"I'm
off
the
phone,"
Fache
snapped,
stalking
into
the
room.
"What
have
you
got?"
The
second
agent
said,
"Sir,
Central
just
heard
from
Andre
Vernet
at
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich.
He
wants
to
talk
to
you
privately.
He
is
changing
his
story."
"Oh?"
Fache
said.
Now
Collet
looked
up.
"Vernet
is
admitting
that
Langdon
and
Neveu
spent
time
inside
his
bank
tonight."
"We
figured
that
out,"
Fache
said.
"Why
did
Vernet
lie
about
it?"
"He
said
he'll
talk
only
to
you,
but
he's
agreed
to
cooperate
fully."
"In
exchange
for
what?"
"For
our
keeping
his
bank's
name
out
of
the
news
and
also
for
helping
him
recover
some
stolen
property.
It
sounds
like
Langdon
and
Neveu
stole
something
from
Sauniere's
account."
"What?"
Collet
blurted.
"How?"
Fache
never
flinched,
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
second
agent.
"What
did
they
steal?"
"Vernet
didn't
elaborate,
but
he
sounds
like
he's
willing
to
do
anything
to
get
it
back."
Collet
tried
to
imagine
how
this
could
happen.
Maybe
Langdon
and
Neveu
had
held
a
bank
employee
at
gunpoint?
Maybe
they
forced
Vernet
to
open
Sauniere's
account
and
facilitate
an
escape
in
the
armored
truck.
As
feasible
as
it
was,
Collet
was
having
trouble
believing
Sophie
Neveu
could
be
involved
in
anything
like
that.
From
the
kitchen,
another
agent
yelled
to
Fache.
"Captain?
I'm
going
through
Mr.
Teabing's
speed
dial
numbers,
and
I'm
on
the
phone
with
Le
Bourget
Airfield.
I've
got
some
bad
news."
Thirty
seconds
later,
Fache
was
packing
up
and
preparing
to
leave
Chateau
Villette.
He
had
just
learned
that
Teabing
kept
a
private
jet
nearby
at
Le
Bourget
Airfield
and
that
the
plane
had
taken
off
about
a
half
hour
ago.
The
Bourget
representative
on
the
phone
had
claimed
not
to
know
who
was
on
the
plane
or
where
it
was
headed.
The
takeoff
had
been
unscheduled,
and
no
flight
plan
had
been
logged.
Highly
illegal,
even
for
a
small
airfield.
Fache
was
certain
that
by
applying
the
right
pressure,
he
could
get
the
answers
he
was
looking
for.
"Lieutenant
Collet,"
Fache
barked,
heading
for
the
door.
"I
have
no
choice
but
to
leave
you
in
charge
of
the
PTS
investigation
here.
Try
to
do
something
right
for
a
change."
As
the
Hawker
leveled
off,
with
its
nose
aimed
for
England,
Langdon
carefully
lifted
the
rosewood
box
from
his
lap,
where
he
had
been
protecting
it
during
takeoff.
Now,
as
he
set
the
box
on
the
table,
he
could
sense
Sophie
and
Teabing
leaning
forward
with
anticipation.
Unlatching
the
lid
and
opening
the
box,
Langdon
turned
his
attention
not
to
the
lettered
dials
of
the
cryptex,
but
rather
to
the
tiny
hole
on
the
underside
of
the
box
lid.
Using
the
tip
of
a
pen,
he
carefully
removed
the
inlaid
Rose
on
top
and
revealed
the
text
beneath
it.
Sub
Rosa,
he
mused,
hoping
a
fresh
look
at
the
text
would
bring
clarity.
Focusing
all
his
energies,
Langdon
studied
the
strange
text.
t&amp;%&amp;V7C0dM&amp;
After
several
seconds,
he
began
to
feel
the
initial
frustration
resurfacing.
"Leigh,
I
just
can't
seem
to
place
it.
From
where
Sophie
was
seated
across
the
table,
she
could
not
yet
see
the
text,
but
Langdon's
inability
to
immediately
identify
the
language
surprised
her.
My
grandfather
spoke
a
language
so
obscure
that
even
a
symbologist
can't
identify
it?
She
quickly
realized
she
should
not
find
this
surprising.
This
would
not
be
the
first
secret
Jacques
Sauniere
had
kept
from
his
granddaughter.
Opposite
Sophie,
Leigh
Teabing
felt
ready
to
burst.
Eager
for
his
chance
to
see
the
text,
he
quivered
with
excitement,
leaning
in,
trying
to
see
around
Langdon,
who
was
still
hunched
over
the
box.
"I
don't
know,"
Langdon
whispered
intently.
"My
first
guess
is
a
Semitic,
but
now
I'm
not
so
sure.
Most
primary
Semitics
include
nekkudot.
This
has
none."
"Probably
ancient,"
Teabing
offered.
"Nekkudot?"
Sophie
inquired.
Teabing
never
took
his
eyes
from
the
box.
"Most
modern
Semitic
alphabets
have
no
vowels
and
use
nekkudot
tiny
dots
and
dashes
written
either
below
or
within
the
consonants
to
indicate
what
vowel
sound
accompanies
them.
Historically
speaking,
nekkudot
are
a
relatively
modern
addition
to
language."
Langdon
was
still
hovering
over
the
script.
"A
Sephardic
transliteration,
perhaps?"
Teabing
could
bear
it
no
longer.
"Perhaps
if
I
just"
Reaching
over,
he
edged
the
box
away
from
Langdon
and
pulled
it
toward
himself.
No
doubt
Langdon
had
a
solid
familiarity
with
the
standard
ancients
Greek,
Latin,
the
Romances
but
from
the
fleeting
glance
Teabing
had
of
this
language,
he
thought
it
looked
more
specialized,
possibly
a
Rashi
script
or
a
STA'M
with
crowns.
Taking
a
deep
breath,
Teabing
feasted
his
eyes
upon
the
engraving.
He
said
nothing
for
a
very
long
time.
With
each
passing
second,
Teabing
felt
his
confidence
deflating.
"I'm
astonished,"
he
said.
"This
language
looks
like
nothing
I've
ever
seen!"
Langdon
slumped.
"Might
I
see
it?"
Sophie
asked.
Teabing
pretended
not
to
hear
her.
"Robert,
you
said
earlier
that
you
thought
you'd
seen
something
like
this
before?"
Langdon
looked
vexed.
"I
thought
so.
I'm
not
sure.
The
script
looks
familiar
somehow."
"Leigh?"
Sophie
repeated,
clearly
not
appreciating
being
left
out
of
the
discussion.
"Might
I
have
a
look
at
the
box
my
grandfather
made?"
"Of
course,
dear,"
Teabing
said,
pushing
it
over
to
her.
He
hadn't
meant
to
sound
belittling,
and
yet
Sophie
Neveu
was
light
years
out
of
her
league.
If
a
British
Royal
Historian
and
a
Harvard
symbologist
could
not
even
identify
the
language
"Aah,"
Sophie
said,
seconds
after
examining
the
box.
"I
should
have
guessed."
Teabing
and
Langdon
turned
in
unison,
staring
at
her.
"Guessed
what?"
Teabing
demanded.
Sophie
shrugged.
"Guessed
that
this
would
be
the
language
my
grandfather
would
have
used."
"You're
saying
you
can
read
this
text?"
Teabing
exclaimed.
"Quite
easily,"
Sophie
chimed,
obviously
enjoying
herself
now.
"My
grandfather
taught
me
this
language
when
I
was
only
six
years
old.
I'm
fluent."
She
leaned
across
the
table
and
fixed
Teabing
with
an
admonishing
glare.
"And
frankly,
sir,
considering
your
allegiance
to
the
Crown,
I'm
a
little
surprised
you
didn't
recognize
it."
In
a
flash,
Langdon
knew.
No
wonder
the
script
looks
so
damned
familiar!
Several
years
ago,
Langdon
had
attended
an
event
at
Harvard's
Fogg
Museum.
Harvard
dropout
Bill
Gates
had
returned
to
his
alma
mater
to
lend
to
the
museum
one
of
his
priceless
acquisitions
eighteen
sheets
of
paper
he
had
recently
purchased
at
auction
from
the
Armand
Hammar
Estate.
His
winning
bid
a
cool
$30.8
million.
The
author
of
the
pages
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
The
eighteen
folios
now
known
as
Leonardo's
Codex
Leicester
after
their
famous
owner,
the
Earl
of
Leicester
were
all
that
remained
of
one
of
Leonardo's
most
fascinating
notebooks:
essays
and
drawings
outlining
Da
Vinci's
progressive
theories
on
astronomy,
geology,
archaeology,
and
hydrology.
Langdon
would
never
forget
his
reaction
after
waiting
in
line
and
finally
viewing
the
priceless
parchment.
Utter
letdown.
The
pages
were
unintelligible.
Despite
being
beautifully
preserved
and
written
in
an
impeccably
neat
penmanship
crimson
ink
on
cream
paper
the
codex
looked
like
gibberish.
At
first
Langdon
thought
he
could
not
read
them
because
Da
Vinci
wrote
his
notebooks
in
an
archaic
Italian.
But
after
studying
them
more
closely,
he
realized
he
could
not
identify
a
single
Italian
word,
or
even
one
letter.
"Try
this,
sir,"
whispered
the
female
docent
at
the
display
case.
She
motioned
to
a
hand
mirror
affixed
to
the
display
on
a
chain.
Langdon
picked
it
up
and
examined
the
text
in
the
mirror's
surface.
Instantly
it
was
clear.
Langdon
had
been
so
eager
to
peruse
some
of
the
great
thinker's
ideas
that
he
had
forgotten
one
of
the
man's
numerous
artistic
talents
was
an
ability
to
write
in
a
mirrored
script
that
was
virtually
illegible
to
anyone
other
than
himself.
Historians
still
debated
whether
Da
Vinci
wrote
this
way
simply
to
amuse
himself
or
to
keep
people
from
peering
over
his
shoulder
and
stealing
his
ideas,
but
the
point
was
moot.
Da
Vinci
did
as
he
pleased.
Sophie
smiled
inwardly
to
see
that
Robert
understood
her
meaning.
"I
can
read
the
first
few
words,"
she
said.
"It's
English."
Teabing
was
still
sputtering.
"What's
going
on?"
"Reverse
text,"
Langdon
said.
"We
need
a
mirror."
"No
we
don't,"
Sophie
said.
"I
bet
this
veneer
is
thin
enough."
She
lifted
the
rosewood
box
up
to
a
canister
light
on
the
wall
and
began
examining
the
underside
of
the
lid.
Her
grandfather
couldn't
actually
write
in
reverse,
so
he
always
cheated
by
writing
normally
and
then
flipping
the
paper
over
and
tracing
the
reversed
impression.
Sophie's
guess
was
that
he
had
wood
burned
normal
text
into
a
block
of
wood
and
then
run
the
back
of
the
block
through
a
sander
until
the
wood
was
paper
thin
and
the
wood
burning
could
be
seen
through
the
wood.
Then
he'd
simply
flipped
the
piece
over,
and
laid
it
in.
As
Sophie
moved
the
lid
closer
to
the
light,
she
saw
she
was
right.
The
bright
beam
sifted
through
the
thin
layer
of
wood,
and
the
script
appeared
in
reverse
on
the
underside
of
the
lid.
Instantly
legible.
"English,"
Teabing
croaked,
hanging
his
head
in
shame.
"My
native
tongue."
At
the
rear
of
the
plane,
Remy
Legaludec
strained
to
hear
beyond
the
rumbling
engines,
but
the
conversation
up
front
was
inaudible.
Remy
did
not
like
the
way
the
night
was
progressing.
Not
at
all.
He
looked
down
at
the
bound
monk
at
his
feet.
The
man
lay
perfectly
still
now,
as
if
in
a
trance
of
acceptance,
or
perhaps,
in
silent
prayer
for
deliverance.
Fifteen
thousand
feet
in
the
air,
Robert
Langdon
felt
the
physical
world
fade
away
as
all
of
his
thoughts
converged
on
Sauniere's
mirror
image
poem,
which
was
illuminated
through
the
lid
of
the
box.
^^3ftkV3wta
w&amp;Ssii
Sophie
quickly
found
some
paper
and
copied
it
down
longhand.
When
she
was
done,
the
three
of
them
took
turns
reading
the
text.
It
was
like
some
kind
of
archaeological
crossword
a
riddle
that
promised
to
reveal
how
to
open
the
cryptex.
Langdon
read
the
verse
slowly.
An
ancient
word
of
wisdom
frees
this
scroll
and
helps
us
keep
her
scatter'
d
family
whole,
headstone
praised
by
templars
is
the
key
and
atbash
will
reveal
the
truth
to
thee.
a
Before
Langdon
could
even
ponder
what
ancient
password
the
verse
was
trying
to
reveal,
he
felt
something
far
more
fundamental
resonate
within
him
the
meter
of
the
poem.
Iambic
pentameter.
Langdon
had
come
across
this
meter
often
over
the
years
while
researching
secret
societies
across
Europe,
including
just
last
year
in
the
Vatican
Secret
Archives.
For
centuries,
iambic
pentameter
had
been
a
preferred
poetic
meter
of
outspoken
literati
across
the
globe,
from
the
ancient
Greek
writer
Archilochus
to
Shakespeare,
Milton,
Chaucer,
and
Voltaire
bold
souls
who
chose
to
write
their
social
commentaries
in
a
meter
that
many
of
the
day
believed
had
mystical
properties.
The
roots
of
iambic
pentameter
were
deeply
pagan.
Iambs.
Two
syllables
with
opposite
emphasis.
Stressed
and
unstressed.
Yin
yang.
A
balanced
pair.
Arranged
in
strings
of
five.
Pentameter.
Five
for
the
pentacle
of
Venus
and
the
sacred
feminine.
"It's
pentameter!"
Teabing
blurted,
turning
to
Langdon.
"And
the
verse
is
in
English!
La
lingua
pural"
Langdon
nodded.
The
Priory,
like
many
European
secret
societies
at
odds
with
the
Church,
had
considered
English
the
only
European
pure
language
for
centuries.
Unlike
French,
Spanish,
and
Italian,
which
were
rooted
in
Latin
the
tongue
of
the
Vatican
English
was
linguistically
removed
from
Rome's
propaganda
machine,
and
therefore
became
a
sacred,
secret
tongue
for
those
brotherhoods
educated
enough
to
learn
it.
"This
poem,"
Teabing
gushed,
"references
not
only
the
Grail,
but
the
Knights
Templar
and
the
scattered
family
of
Mary
Magdalene!
What
more
could
we
ask
for?"
"The
password,"
Sophie
said,
looking
again
at
the
poem.
"It
sounds
like
we
need
some
kind
of
ancient
word
of
wisdom?"
"Abracadabra?"
Teabing
ventured,
his
eyes
twinkling.
A
word
of
five
letters,
Langdon
thought,
pondering
the
staggering
number
of
ancient
words
that
might
be
considered
words
of
wisdom
selections
from
mystic
chants,
astrological
prophecies,
secret
society
inductions,
Wicca
incantations,
Egyptian
magic
spells,
pagan
mantras
the
list
was
endless.
"The
password,"
Sophie
said,
"appears
to
have
something
to
do
with
the
Templars."
She
read
the
text
aloud.
"
'A
headstone
praised
by
Templars
is
the
key.'
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
"you're
the
Templar
specialist.
Any
ideas?"
Teabing
was
silent
for
several
seconds
and
then
sighed.
"Well,
a
headstone
is
obviously
a
grave
marker
of
some
sort.
It's
possible
the
poem
is
referencing
a
gravestone
the
Templars
praised
at
the
tomb
of
Magdalene,
but
that
doesn't
help
us
much
because
we
have
no
idea
where
her
tomb
is."
"The
last
line,"
Sophie
said,
"says
that
Atbash
will
reveal
the
truth.
I've
heard
that
word.
Atbash."
"I'm
not
surprised,"
Langdon
replied.
"You
probably
heard
it
in
Cryptology
101.
The
Atbash
Cipher
is
one
of
the
oldest
codes
known
to
man."
Of
course!
Sophie
thought.
The
famous
Hebrew
encoding
system.
The
Atbash
Cipher
had
indeed
been
part
of
Sophie's
early
cryptology
training.
The
cipher
dated
back
to
500
B.C.
and
was
now
used
as
a
classroom
example
of
a
basic
rotational
substitution
scheme.
A
common
form
of
Jewish
cryptogram,
the
Atbash
Cipher
was
a
simple
substitution
code
based
on
the
twenty
two
letter
Hebrew
alphabet.
In
Atbash,
the
first
letter
was
substituted
by
the
last
letter,
the
second
letter
by
the
next
to
last
letter,
and
so
on.
"Atbash
is
sublimely
appropriate,"
Teabing
said.
"Text
encrypted
with
Atbash
is
found
throughout
the
Kabbala,
the
Dead
Sea
Scrolls,
and
even
the
Old
Testament.
Jewish
scholars
and
mystics
are
still
finding
hidden
meanings
using
Atbash.
The
Priory
certainly
would
include
the
Atbash
Cipher
as
part
of
their
teachings."
"The
only
problem,"
Langdon
said,
"is
that
we
don't
have
anything
on
which
to
apply
the
cipher."
Teabing
sighed.
"There
must
be
a
code
word
on
the
headstone.
We
must
find
this
headstone
praised
by
Templars."
Sophie
sensed
from
the
grim
look
on
Langdon's
face
that
finding
the
Templar
headstone
would
be
no
small
feat.
Atbash
is
the
key,
Sophie
thought.
But
we
don
't
have
a
door.
It
was
three
minutes
later
that
Teabing
heaved
a
frustrated
sigh
and
shook
his
head.
"My
friends,
I'm
stymied.
Let
me
ponder
this
while
I
get
us
some
nibblies
and
check
on
Remy
and
our
guest."
He
stood
up
and
headed
for
the
back
of
the
plane.
Sophie
felt
tired
as
she
watched
him
go.
Outside
the
window,
the
blackness
of
the
predawn
was
absolute.
Sophie
felt
as
if
she
were
being
hurtled
through
space
with
no
idea
where
she
would
land.
Having
grown
up
solving
her
grandfather's
riddles,
she
had
the
uneasy
sense
right
now
that
this
poem
before
them
contained
information
they
still
had
not
seen.
There
is
more
there,
she
told
herself.
Ingeniously
hidden
but
present
nonetheless.
Also
plaguing
her
thoughts
was
a
fear
that
what
they
eventually
found
inside
this
cryptex
would
not
be
as
simple
as
"a
map
to
the
Holy
Grail."
Despite
Teabing's
and
Langdon's
confidence
that
the
truth
lay
just
within
the
marble
cylinder,
Sophie
had
solved
enough
of
her
grandfather's
treasure
hunts
to
know
that
Jacques
Sauniere
did
not
give
up
his
secrets
easily.
Bourget
Airfield's
night
shift
air
traffic
controller
had
been
dozing
before
a
blank
radar
screen
when
the
captain
of
the
Judicial
Police
practically
broke
down
his
door.
"Teabing's
jet,"
Bezu
Fache
blared,
marching
into
the
small
tower,
"where
did
it
go?"
The
controller's
initial
response
was
a
babbling,
lame
attempt
to
protect
the
privacy
of
their
British
client
one
of
the
airfield's
most
respected
customers.
It
failed
miserably.
"Okay,"
Fache
said,
"I
am
placing
you
under
arrest
for
permitting
a
private
plane
to
take
off
without
registering
a
flight
plan.
"
Fache
motioned
to
another
officer,
who
approached
with
handcuffs,
and
the
traffic
controller
felt
a
surge
of
terror.
He
thought
of
the
newspaper
articles
debating
whether
the
nation's
police
captain
was
a
hero
or
a
menace.
That
question
had
just
been
answered.
"Wait!"
the
controller
heard
himself
whimper
at
the
sight
of
the
handcuffs.
"I
can
tell
you
this
much.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
makes
frequent
trips
to
London
for
medical
treatments.
He
has
a
hangar
at
Biggin
Hill
Executive
Airport
in
Kent.
On
the
outskirts
of
London."
Fache
waved
off
the
man
with
the
cuffs.
"Is
Biggin
Hill
his
destination
tonight?"
"I
don't
know,"
the
controller
said
honestly.
"The
plane
left
on
its
usual
tack,
and
his
last
radar
contact
suggested
the
United
Kingdom.
Biggin
Hill
is
an
extremely
likely
guess."
"Did
he
have
others
onboard?"
"I
swear,
sir,
there
is
no
way
for
me
to
know
that.
Our
clients
can
drive
directly
to
their
hangars,
and
load
as
they
please.
Who
is
onboard
is
the
responsibility
of
the
customs
officials
at
the
receiving
airport."
Fache
checked
his
watch
and
gazed
out
at
the
scattering
of
jets
parked
in
front
of
the
terminal.
"If
they're
going
to
Biggin
Hill,
how
long
until
they
land?"
The
controller
fumbled
through
his
records.
"It's
a
short
flight.
His
plane
could
be
on
the
ground
by
around
six
thirty.
Fifteen
minutes
from
now."
Fache
frowned
and
turned
to
one
of
his
men.
"Get
a
transport
up
here.
I'm
going
to
London.
And
get
me
the
Kent
local
police.
Not
British
MI5.
1
want
this
quiet.
Kent
local.
Tell
them
I
want
Teabing's
plane
to
be
permitted
to
land.
Then
I
want
it
surrounded
on
the
tarmac.
Nobody
deplanes
until
I
get
there."
"You're
quiet,"
Langdon
said,
gazing
across
the
Hawker's
cabin
at
Sophie.
"Just
tired,"
she
replied.
"And
the
poem.
I
don't
know."
Langdon
was
feeling
the
same
way.
The
hum
of
the
engines
and
the
gentle
rocking
of
the
plane
were
hypnotic,
and
his
head
still
throbbed
where
he'd
been
hit
by
the
monk.
Teabing
was
still
in
the
back
of
the
plane,
and
Langdon
decided
to
take
advantage
of
the
moment
alone
with
Sophie
to
tell
her
something
that
had
been
on
his
mind.
"I
think
I
know
part
of
the
reason
why
your
grandfather
conspired
to
put
us
together.
I
think
there's
something
he
wanted
me
to
explain
to
you."
"The
history
of
the
Holy
Grail
and
Mary
Magdalene
isn't
enough?"
Langdon
felt
uncertain
how
to
proceed.
"The
rift
between
you.
The
reason
you
haven't
spoken
to
him
in
ten
years.
I
think
maybe
he
was
hoping
I
could
somehow
make
that
right
by
explaining
what
drove
you
apart."
Sophie
squirmed
in
her
seat.
"I
haven't
told
you
what
drove
us
apart."
Langdon
eyed
her
carefully.
"You
witnessed
a
sex
rite.
Didn't
you?"
Sophie
recoiled.
"How
do
you
know
that?"
"Sophie,
you
told
me
you
witnessed
something
that
convinced
you
your
grandfather
was
in
a
secret
society.
And
whatever
you
saw
upset
you
enough
that
you
haven't
spoken
to
him
since.
I
know
a
fair
amount
about
secret
societies.
It
doesn't
take
the
brains
of
Da
Vinci
to
guess
what
you
saw."
Sophie
stared.
"Was
it
in
the
spring?"
Langdon
asked.
"Sometime
around
the
equinox?
Mid
March?"
Sophie
looked
out
the
window.
"I
was
on
spring
break
from
university.
I
came
home
a
few
days
early."
"You
want
to
tell
me
about
it?"
"I'd
rather
not."
She
turned
suddenly
back
to
Langdon,
her
eyes
welling
with
emotion.
"I
don't
know
what
I
saw."
"Were
both
men
and
women
present?"
After
a
beat,
she
nodded.
"Dressed
in
white
and
black?"
She
wiped
her
eyes
and
then
nodded,
seeming
to
open
up
a
little.
"The
women
were
in
white
gossamer
gowns
with
golden
shoes.
They
held
golden
orbs.
The
men
wore
black
tunics
and
black
shoes."
Langdon
strained
to
hide
his
emotion,
and
yet
he
could
not
believe
what
he
was
hearing.
Sophie
Neveu
had
unwittingly
witnessed
a
two
thousand
year
old
sacred
ceremony.
"Masks?"
he
asked,
keeping
his
voice
calm.
"Androgynous
masks?"
"Yes.
Everyone.
Identical
masks.
White
on
the
women.
Black
on
the
men."
Langdon
had
read
descriptions
of
this
ceremony
and
understood
its
mystic
roots.
"It's
called
Hieros
Gamos,"
he
said
softly.
"It
dates
back
more
than
two
thousand
years.
Egyptian
priests
and
priestesses
performed
it
regularly
to
celebrate
the
reproductive
power
of
the
female,"
He
paused,
leaning
toward
her.
"And
if
you
witnessed
Hieros
Gamos
without
being
properly
prepared
to
understand
its
meaning,
I
imagine
it
would
be
pretty
shocking."
Sophie
said
nothing.
"Hieros
Gamos
is
Greek,"
he
continued.
"It
means
sacred
marriage.
"The
ritual
I
saw
was
no
marriage."
"Marriage
as
in
union,
Sophie."
"You
mean
as
in
sex."
"No."
"No?"
she
said,
her
olive
eyes
testing
him.
Langdon
backpedaled.
"Well
yes,
in
a
manner
of
speaking,
but
not
as
we
understand
it
today."
He
explained
that
although
what
she
saw
probably
looked
like
a
sex
ritual,
Hieros
Gamos
had
nothing
to
do
with
eroticism.
It
was
a
spiritual
act.
Historically,
intercourse
was
the
act
through
which
male
and
female
experienced
God.
The
ancients
believed
that
the
male
was
spiritually
incomplete
until
he
had
carnal
knowledge
of
the
sacred
feminine.
Physical
union
with
the
female
remained
the
sole
means
through
which
man
could
become
spiritually
complete
and
ultimately
achieve
gnosis
knowledge
of
the
divine.
Since
the
days
of
Isis,
sex
rites
had
been
considered
man's
only
bridge
from
earth
to
heaven.
"By
communing
with
woman,"
Langdon
said,
"man
could
achieve
a
climactic
instant
when
his
mind
went
totally
blank
and
he
could
see
God.
Sophie
looked
skeptical.
"Orgasm
as
prayer?"
Langdon
gave
a
noncommittal
shrug,
although
Sophie
was
essentially
correct.
Physiologically
speaking,
the
male
climax
was
accompanied
by
a
split
second
entirely
devoid
of
thought.
A
brief
mental
vacuum.
A
moment
of
clarity
during
which
God
could
be
glimpsed.
Meditation
gurus
achieved
similar
states
of
thoughtlessness
without
sex
and
often
described
Nirvana
as
a
never
ending
spiritual
orgasm.
"Sophie,"
Langdon
said
quietly,
"it's
important
to
remember
that
the
ancients'
view
of
sex
was
entirely
opposite
from
ours
today.
Sex
begot
new
life
the
ultimate
miracle
and
miracles
could
be
performed
only
by
a
god.
The
ability
of
the
woman
to
produce
life
from
her
womb
made
her
sacred.
A
god.
Intercourse
was
the
revered
union
of
the
two
halves
of
the
human
spirit
male
and
female
through
which
the
male
could
find
spiritual
wholeness
and
communion
with
God.
What
you
saw
was
not
about
sex,
it
was
about
spirituality.
The
Hieros
Gamos
ritual
is
not
a
perversion.
It's
a
deeply
sacrosanct
ceremony."
His
words
seemed
to
strike
a
nerve.
Sophie
had
been
remarkably
poised
all
evening,
but
now,
for
the
first
time,
Langdon
saw
the
aura
of
composure
beginning
to
crack.
Tears
materialized
in
her
eyes
again,
and
she
dabbed
them
away
with
her
sleeve.
He
gave
her
a
moment.
Admittedly,
the
concept
of
sex
as
a
pathway
to
God
was
mind
boggling
at
first.
Langdon's
Jewish
students
always
looked
flabbergasted
when
he
first
told
them
that
the
early
Jewish
tradition
involved
ritualistic
sex.
In
the
Temple,
no
less.
Early
Jews
believed
that
the
Holy
of
Holies
in
Solomon's
Temple
housed
not
only
God
but
also
His
powerful
female
equal,
Shekinah.
Men
seeking
spiritual
wholeness
came
to
the
Temple
to
visit
priestesses
or
hierodules
with
whom
they
made
love
and
experienced
the
divine
through
physical
union.
The
Jewish
tetragrammaton
YHWH
the
sacred
name
of
God
in
fact
derived
from
Jehovah,
an
androgynous
physical
union
between
the
masculine
Jah
and
the
pre
Hebraic
name
for
Eve,
Havah.
"For
the
early
Church,"
Langdon
explained
in
a
soft
voice,
"mankind's
use
of
sex
to
commune
directly
with
God
posed
a
serious
threat
to
the
Catholic
power
base.
It
left
the
Church
out
of
the
loop,
undermining
their
selfproclaimed
status
as
the
sole
conduit
to
God.
For
obvious
reasons,
they
worked
hard
to
demonize
sex
and
recast
it
as
a
disgusting
and
sinful
act.
Other
major
religions
did
the
same."
Sophie
was
silent,
but
Langdon
sensed
she
was
starting
to
understand
her
grandfather
better.
Ironically,
Langdon
had
made
this
same
point
in
a
class
lecture
earlier
this
semester.
"Is
it
surprising
we
feel
conflicted
about
sex?"
he
asked
his
students.
"Our
ancient
heritage
and
our
very
physiologies
tell
us
sex
is
natural
a
cherished
route
to
spiritual
fulfillment
and
yet
modern
religion
decries
it
as
shameful,
teaching
us
to
fear
our
sexual
desire
as
the
hand
of
the
devil."
Langdon
decided
not
to
shock
his
students
with
the
fact
that
more
than
a
dozen
secret
societies
around
the
world
many
of
them
quite
influential
still
practiced
sex
rites
and
kept
the
ancient
traditions
alive.
Tom
Cruise's
character
in
the
film
Eyes
Wide
Shut
discovered
this
the
hard
way
when
he
sneaked
into
a
private
gathering
of
ultraelite
Manhattanites
only
to
find
himself
witnessing
Hieros
Gamos.
Sadly,
the
filmmakers
had
gotten
most
of
the
specifics
wrong,
but
the
basic
gist
was
there
a
secret
society
communing
to
celebrate
the
magic
of
sexual
union.
"Professor
Langdon?"
A
male
student
in
back
raised
his
hand,
sounding
hopeful.
"Are
you
saying
that
instead
of
going
to
chapel,
we
should
have
more
sex?"
Langdon
chuckled,
not
about
to
take
the
bait.
From
what
he'd
heard
about
Harvard
parties,
these
kids
were
having
more
than
enough
sex.
"Gentlemen,"
he
said,
knowing
he
was
on
tender
ground,
"might
I
offer
a
suggestion
for
all
of
you.
Without
being
so
bold
as
to
condone
premarital
sex,
and
without
being
so
naive
as
to
think
you're
all
chaste
angels,
I
will
give
you
this
bit
of
advice
about
your
sex
lives."
All
the
men
in
the
audience
leaned
forward,
listening
intently.
"The
next
time
you
find
yourself
with
a
woman,
look
in
your
heart
and
see
if
you
cannot
approach
sex
as
a
mystical,
spiritual
act.
Challenge
yourself
to
find
that
spark
of
divinity
that
man
can
only
achieve
through
union
with
the
sacred
feminine."
The
women
smiled
knowingly,
nodding.
The
men
exchanged
dubious
giggles
and
off
color
jokes.
Langdon
sighed.
College
men
were
still
boys.
Sophie's
forehead
felt
cold
as
she
pressed
it
against
the
plane's
window
and
stared
blankly
into
the
void,
trying
to
process
what
Langdon
had
just
told
her.
She
felt
a
new
regret
well
within
her.
Ten
years.
She
pictured
the
stacks
of
unopened
letters
her
grandfather
had
sent
her.
will
tell
Robert
everything.
Without
turning
from
the
window,
Sophie
began
to
speak.
Quietly.
Fearfully.
As
she
began
to
recount
what
had
happened
that
night,
she
felt
herself
drifting
back
alighting
in
the
woods
outside
her
grandfather's
Normandy
chateau
searching
the
deserted
house
in
confusion
hearing
the
voices
below
her
and
then
finding
the
hidden
door.
She
inched
down
the
stone
staircase,
one
step
at
a
time,
into
that
basement
grotto.
She
could
taste
the
earthy
air.
Cool
and
light.
It
was
March.
In
the
shadows
of
her
hiding
place
on
the
staircase,
she
watched
as
the
strangers
swayed
and
chanted
by
flickering
orange
candles.
I'm
dreaming,
Sophie
told
herself.
This
is
a
dream.
What
else
could
this
be?
The
women
and
men
were
staggered,
black,
white,
black,
white.
The
women's
beautiful
gossamer
gowns
billowed
as
they
raised
in
their
right
hands
golden
orbs
and
called
out
in
unison,
'7
was
with
you
in
the
beginning,
in
the
dawn
of
all
that
is
holy,
I
bore
you
from
the
womb
before
the
start
of
day."
The
women
lowered
their
orbs,
and
everyone
rocked
back
and
forth
as
if
in
a
trance.
They
were
revering
something
in
the
center
of
the
circle.
What
are
they
looking
at?
The
voices
accelerated
now.
Louder.
Faster.
"The
woman
whom
you
behold
is
love!"
The
women
called,
raising
their
orbs
again.
The
men
responded,
"She
has
her
dwelling
in
eternity!
The
chanting
grew
steady
again.
Accelerating.
Thundering
now.
Faster.
The
participants
stepped
inward
and
knelt.
In
that
instant,
Sophie
could
finally
see
what
they
were
all
watching.
On
a
low,
ornate
altar
in
the
center
of
the
circle
lay
a
man.
He
was
naked,
positioned
on
his
back,
and
wearing
a
black
mask.
Sophie
instantly
recognized
his
body
and
the
birthmark
on
his
shoulder.
She
almost
cried
out.
Grand
pere!
This
image
alone
would
have
shocked
Sophie
beyond
belief,
and
yet
there
was
more.
Straddling
her
grandfather
was
a
naked
woman
wearing
a
white
mask,
her
luxuriant
silver
hair
flowing
out
behind
it.
Her
body
was
plump,
far
from
perfect,
and
she
was
gyrating
in
rhythm
to
the
chanting
making
love
to
Sophie's
grandfather.
Sophie
wanted
to
turn
and
run,
but
she
couldn't.
The
stone
walls
of
the
grotto
imprisoned
her
as
the
chanting
rose
to
a
fever
pitch.
The
circle
of
participants
seemed
almost
to
be
singing
now,
the
noise
rising
in
crescendo
to
a
frenzy.
With
a
sudden
roar,
the
entire
room
seemed
to
erupt
in
climax.
Sophie
could
not
breathe.
She
suddenly
realized
she
was
quietly
sobbing.
She
turned
and
staggered
silently
up
the
stairs,
out
of
the
house,
and
drove
trembling
back
to
Paris.
The
chartered
turboprop
was
just
passing
over
the
twinkling
lights
of
Monaco
when
Aringarosa
hung
up
on
Fache
for
the
second
time.
He
reached
for
the
airsickness
bag
again
but
felt
too
drained
even
to
be
sick.
Just
let
it
be
over!
Fache's
newest
update
seemed
unfathomable,
and
yet
almost
nothing
tonight
made
sense
anymore.
What
is
going
on
?
Everything
had
spiraled
wildly
out
of
control.
What
have
I
gotten
Silas
into
?
What
have
I
gotten
myself
into!
On
shaky
legs,
Aringarosa
walked
to
the
cockpit.
"I
need
to
change
destinations."
The
pilot
glanced
over
his
shoulder
and
laughed.
"You're
joking,
right?"
"No.
I
have
to
get
to
London
immediately."
"Father,
this
is
a
charter
flight,
not
a
taxi."
"I
will
pay
you
extra,
of
course.
How
much?
London
is
only
one
hour
farther
north
and
requires
almost
no
change
of
direction,
so
"It's
not
a
question
of
money,
Father,
there
are
other
issues."
"Ten
thousand
euro.
Right
now."
The
pilot
turned,
his
eyes
wide
with
shock.
"How
much?
What
kind
of
priest
carries
that
kind
of
cash?"
Aringarosa
walked
back
to
his
black
briefcase,
opened
it,
and
removed
one
of
the
bearer
bonds.
He
handed
it
to
the
pilot.
"What
is
this?"
the
pilot
demanded.
"A
ten
thousand
euro
bearer
bond
drawn
on
the
Vatican
Bank."
The
pilot
looked
dubious.
"It's
the
same
as
cash."
"Only
cash
is
cash,"
the
pilot
said,
handing
the
bond
back.
Aringarosa
felt
weak
as
he
steadied
himself
against
the
cockpit
door.
"This
is
a
matter
of
life
or
death.
You
must
help
me.
I
need
to
get
to
London."
The
pilot
eyed
the
bishop's
gold
ring.
"Real
diamonds?"
Aringarosa
looked
at
the
ring.
"I
could
not
possibly
part
with
this."
The
pilot
shrugged,
turning
and
focusing
back
out
the
windshield.
Aringarosa
felt
a
deepening
sadness.
He
looked
at
the
ring.
Everything
it
represented
was
about
to
be
lost
to
the
bishop
anyway.
After
a
long
moment,
he
slid
the
ring
from
his
finger
and
placed
it
gently
on
the
instrument
panel.
Aringarosa
slunk
out
of
the
cockpit
and
sat
back
down.
Fifteen
seconds
later,
he
could
feel
the
pilot
banking
a
few
more
degrees
to
the
north.
Even
so,
Aringarosa's
moment
of
glory
was
in
shambles.
It
had
all
begun
as
a
holy
cause.
A
brilliantly
crafted
scheme.
Now,
like
a
house
of
cards,
it
was
collapsing
in
on
itself
and
the
end
was
nowhere
in
sight.
Langdon
could
see
Sophie
was
still
shaken
from
recounting
her
experience
of
Hieros
Gamos.
For
his
part,
Langdon
was
amazed
to
have
heard
it.
Not
only
had
Sophie
witnessed
the
full
blown
ritual,
but
her
own
grandfather
had
been
the
celebrant
the
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion.
It
was
heady
company.
Da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
Isaac
Newton,
Victor
Hugo,
Jean
Cocteau
Jacques
Sauniere.
"I
don't
know
what
else
I
can
tell
you,"
Langdon
said
softly.
Sophie's
eyes
were
a
deep
green
now,
tearful.
"He
raised
me
like
his
own
daughter."
Langdon
now
recognized
the
emotion
that
had
been
growing
in
her
eyes
as
they
spoke.
It
was
remorse.
Distant
and
deep.
Sophie
Neveu
had
shunned
her
grandfather
and
was
now
seeing
him
in
an
entirely
different
light.
Outside,
the
dawn
was
coming
fast,
its
crimson
aura
gathering
off
the
starboard.
The
earth
was
still
black
beneath
them.
"Victuals,
my
dears?"
Teabing
rejoined
them
with
a
flourish,
presenting
several
cans
of
Coke
and
a
box
of
old
crackers.
He
apologized
profusely
for
the
limited
fare
as
he
doled
out
the
goods.
"Our
friend
the
monk
isn't
talking
yet,"
he
chimed,
"but
give
him
time."
He
bit
into
a
cracker
and
eyed
the
poem.
"So,
my
lovely,
any
headway?"
He
looked
at
Sophie.
"What
is
your
grandfather
trying
to
tell
us
here?
Where
the
devil
is
this
headstone?
This
headstone
praised
by
Templars."
Sophie
shook
her
head
and
remained
silent.
While
Teabing
again
dug
into
the
verse,
Langdon
popped
a
Coke
and
turned
to
the
window,
his
thoughts
awash
with
images
of
secret
rituals
and
unbroken
codes.
A
headstone
praised
by
Templars
is
the
key.
He
took
a
long
sip
from
the
can.
A
headstone
praised
by
Templars.
The
cola
was
warm.
The
dissolving
veil
of
night
seemed
to
evaporate
quickly,
and
as
Langdon
watched
the
transformation,
he
saw
a
shimmering
ocean
stretch
out
beneath
them.
The
English
Channel.
It
wouldn't
be
long
now.
Langdon
willed
the
light
of
day
to
bring
with
it
a
second
kind
of
illumination,
but
the
lighter
it
became
outside,
the
further
he
felt
from
the
truth.
He
heard
the
rhythms
of
iambic
pentameter
and
chanting,
Hieros
Gamos
and
sacred
rites,
resonating
with
the
rumble
of
the
jet.
A
headstone
praised
by
Templars.
The
plane
was
over
land
again
when
a
flash
of
enlightenment
struck
him.
Langdon
set
down
his
empty
can
of
Coke
hard.
"You
won't
believe
this,"
he
said,
turning
to
the
others.
"The
Templar
headstone
I
figured
it
out."
Teabing's
eyes
turned
to
saucers.
"You
know
where
the
headstone
is?"
Langdon
smiled.
"Not
where
it
is.
What
it
is."
Sophie
leaned
in
to
hear.
"I
think
the
headstone
references
a
literal
stone
head,
"
Langdon
explained,
savoring
the
familiar
excitement
of
academic
breakthrough.
"Not
a
grave
marker."
"A
stone
head?"
Teabing
demanded.
Sophie
looked
equally
confused.
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
turning,
"during
the
Inquisition,
the
Church
accused
the
Knights
Templar
of
all
kinds
of
heresies,
right?"
"Correct.
They
fabricated
all
kinds
of
charges.
Sodomy,
urination
on
the
cross,
devil
worship,
quite
a
list."
"And
on
that
list
was
the
worship
of
false
idols,
right?
Specifically,
the
Church
accused
the
Templars
of
secretly
performing
rituals
in
which
they
prayed
to
a
carved
stone
head
the
pagan
god
"Baphomet!"
Teabing
blurted.
"My
heavens,
Robert,
you're
right!
A
headstone
praised
by
Templars!"
Langdon
quickly
explained
to
Sophie
that
Baphomet
was
a
pagan
fertility
god
associated
with
the
creative
force
of
reproduction.
Baphomet's
head
was
represented
as
that
of
a
ram
or
goat,
a
common
symbol
of
procreation
and
fecundity.
The
Templars
honored
Baphomet
by
encircling
a
stone
replica
of
his
head
and
chanting
prayers.
"Baphomet,"
Teabing
tittered.
"The
ceremony
honored
the
creative
magic
of
sexual
union,
but
Pope
Clement
convinced
everyone
that
Baphomet's
head
was
in
fact
that
of
the
devil.
The
Pope
used
the
head
of
Baphomet
as
the
linchpin
in
his
case
against
the
Templars."
Langdon
concurred.
The
modern
belief
in
a
homed
devil
known
as
Satan
could
be
traced
back
to
Baphomet
and
the
Church's
attempts
to
recast
the
horned
fertility
god
as
a
symbol
of
evil.
The
Church
had
obviously
succeeded,
although
not
entirely.
Traditional
American
Thanksgiving
tables
still
bore
pagan,
horned
fertility
symbols.
The
cornucopia
or
"horn
of
plenty"
was
a
tribute
to
Baphomet's
fertility
and
dated
back
to
Zeus
being
suckled
by
a
goat
whose
horn
broke
off
and
magically
filled
with
fruit.
Baphomet
also
appeared
in
group
photographs
when
some
joker
raised
two
fingers
behind
a
friend's
head
in
the
V
symbol
of
horns;
certainly
few
of
the
pranksters
realized
their
mocking
gesture
was
in
fact
advertising
their
victim's
robust
sperm
count.
"Yes,
yes,"
Teabing
was
saying
excitedly.
"Baphomet
must
be
what
the
poem
is
referring
to.
A
headstone
praised
by
Templars."
"Okay,"
Sophie
said,
"but
if
Baphomet
is
the
headstone
praised
by
Templars,
then
we
have
a
new
dilemma."
She
pointed
to
the
dials
on
the
cryptex.
"Baphomet
has
eight
letters.
We
only
have
room
for
five.
Teabing
grinned
broadly.
"My
dear,
this
is
where
the
Atbash
Cipher
comes
into
play"
Langdon
was
impressed.
Teabing
had
just
finished
writing
out
the
entire
twenty
two
letter
Hebrew
alphabet
alef
beit
from
memory.
Granted,
he'd
used
Roman
equivalents
rather
than
Hebrew
characters,
but
even
so,
he
was
now
reading
through
them
with
flawless
pronunciation.
ABGDHVZChTYKLMNSOPTzQRShTh

"
Teabing
dramatically
mopped
his
brow
and
plowed
on.
"In
formal
Hebrew
spelling,
the
vowel
sounds
are
not
written.
Therefore,
when
we
write
the
word
Baphomet
using
the
Hebrew
alphabet,
it
will
lose
its
three
vowels
in
translation,
leaving
us
"Five
letters,"
Sophie
blurted.
Teabing
nodded
and
began
writing
again.
"Okay,
here
is
the
proper
spelling
of
Baphomet
in
Hebrew
letters.
I'll
sketch
in
the
missing
vowels
for
clarity's
sake.
BaPVoMeTh
"Remember,
of
course,"
he
added,
"that
Hebrew
is
normally
written
in
the
opposite
direction,
but
we
can
just
as
easily
use
Atbash
this
way.
Next,
all
we
have
to
do
is
create
our
substitution
scheme
by
rewriting
the
entire
alphabet
in
reverse
order
opposite
the
original
alphabet."
"There's
an
easier
way,"
Sophie
said,
taking
the
pen
from
Teabing.
"It
works
for
all
reflectional
substitution
ciphers,
including
the
Atbash.
A
little
trick
I
learned
at
the
Royal
Holloway."
Sophie
wrote
the
first
half
of
the
alphabet
from
left
to
right,
and
then,
beneath
it,
wrote
the
second
half,
right
to
left.
"Cryptanalysts
call
it
the
fold
over.
Half
as
complicated.
Twice
as
clean."

Teabing
eyed
her
handiwork
and
chuckled.
"Right
you
are.
Glad
to
see
those
boys
at
the
Holloway
are
doing
their
job."
Looking
at
Sophie's
substitution
matrix,
Langdon
felt
a
rising
thrill
that
he
imagined
must
have
rivaled
the
thrill
felt
by
early
scholars
when
they
first
used
the
Atbash
Cipher
to
decrypt
the
now
famous
Mystery
of
Sheshach.
For
years,
religious
scholars
had
been
baffled
by
biblical
references
to
a
city
called
Sheshach.
The
city
did
not
appear
on
any
map
nor
in
any
other
documents,
and
yet
it
was
mentioned
repeatedly
in
the
Book
of
Jeremiah
the
king
of
Sheshach,
the
city
of
Sheshach,
the
people
of
Sheshach.
Finally,
a
scholar
applied
the
Atbash
Cipher
to
the
word,
and
his
results
were
mind
numbing.
The
cipher
revealed
that
Sheshach
was
in
fact
a
code
word
for
another
very
well
known
city.
The
decryption
process
was
simple.
Sheshach,
in
Hebrew,
was
spelled:
Sh
Sh
K.
Sh
Sh
K,
when
placed
in
the
substitution
matrix,
became
B
B
L.
B
B
L,
in
Hebrew,
spelled
Babel.
The
mysterious
city
of
Sheshach
was
revealed
as
the
city
of
Babel,
and
a
frenzy
of
biblical
examination
ensued.
Within
weeks,
several
more
Atbash
code
words
were
uncovered
in
the
Old
Testament,
unveiling
myriad
hidden
meanings
that
scholars
had
no
idea
were
there.
"We're
getting
close,"
Langdon
whispered,
unable
to
control
his
excitement.
"Inches,
Robert,"
Teabing
said.
He
glanced
over
at
Sophie
and
smiled.
"You
ready?"
She
nodded.
"Okay,
Baphomet
in
Hebrew
without
the
vowels
reads:
B
P
V
M
Th.
Now
we
simply
apply
your
Atbash
substitution
matrix
to
translate
the
letters
into
our
five
letter
password."
Langdon's
heart
pounded.
B
P
V
M
Th.
The
sun
was
pouring
through
the
windows
now.
He
looked
at
Sophie's
substitution
matrix
and
slowly
began
to
make
the
conversion.
B
is
Sh
P
is
V
Teabing
was
grinning
like
a
schoolboy
at
Christmas.
"And
the
Atbash
Cipher
reveals"
He
stopped
short.
"Good
God!"
His
face
went
white.
Langdon's
head
snapped
up.
"What's
wrong?"
Sophie
demanded.
"You
won't
believe
this."
Teabing
glanced
at
Sophie.
"Especially
you."
"What
do
you
mean?"
she
said.
"This
is
ingenious,"
he
whispered.
"Utterly
ingenious!"
Teabing
wrote
again
on
the
paper.
"Drumroll,
please.
Here
is
your
password."
He
showed
them
what
he
had
written.
Sh
V
P
Y
A
Sophie
scowled.
"What
is
it?"
Langdon
didn't
recognize
it
either.
Teabing's
voice
seemed
to
tremble
with
awe.
"This,
my
friend,
is
actually
an
ancient
word
of
wisdom."
Langdon
read
the
letters
again.
An
ancient
word
of
wisdom
frees
this
scroll.
An
instant
later
he
got
it.
He
had
newer
seen
this
coming.
"An
ancient
word
of
wisdom!"
Teabing
was
laughing.
"Quite
literally!"
Sophie
looked
at
the
word
and
then
at
the
dial.
Immediately
she
realized
Langdon
and
Teabing
had
failed
to
see
a
serious
glitch.
"Hold
on!
This
can't
be
the
password,"
she
argued.
"The
cryptex
doesn't
have
an
Sh
on
the
dial.
It
uses
a
traditional
Roman
alphabet.
"Read
the
word,"
Langdon
urged.
"Keep
in
mind
two
things.
In
Hebrew,
the
symbol
for
the
sound
Sh
can
also
be
pronounced
as
S,
depending
on
the
accent.
Just
as
the
letter
P
can
be
pronounced
F."
SVFYA?
she
thought,
puzzled.
"Genius!"
Teabing
added.
"The
letter
Vav
is
often
a
placeholder
for
the
vowel
sound
O!"
Sophie
again
looked
at
the
letters,
attempting
to
sound
them
out.
"Sofya."
She
heard
the
sound
of
her
voice,
and
could
not
believe
what
she
had
just
said.
"Sophia?
This
spells
Sophia?"
Langdon
was
nodding
enthusiastically.
"Yes!
Sophia
literally
means
wisdom
in
Greek.
The
root
of
your
name,
Sophie,
is
literally
a
'word
of
wisdom.'
Sophie
suddenly
missed
her
grandfather
immensely.
He
encrypted
the
Priory
keystone
with
my
name.
A
knot
caught
in
her
throat.
It
all
seemed
so
perfect.
But
as
she
turned
her
gaze
to
the
five
lettered
dials
on
the
cryptex,
she
realized
a
problem
still
existed.
"But
wait
the
word
Sophia
has
six
letters."
Teabing's
smile
never
faded.
"Look
at
the
poem
again.
Your
grandfather
wrote,
'An
ancient
word
of
wisdom.'
"Yes?"
Teabing
winked.
"In
ancient
Greek,
wisdom
is
spelled
S
O
F
I
A."
Sophie
felt
a
wild
excitement
as
she
cradled
the
cryptex
and
began
dialing
in
the
letters.
An
ancient
word
of
wisdom
frees
this
scroll.
Langdon
and
Teabing
seemed
to
have
stopped
breathing
as
they
looked
on.
S
OF
"Carefully,"
Teabing
urged.
"Ever
so
carefully."
I
A.
Sophie
aligned
the
final
dial.
"Okay,"
she
whispered,
glancing
up
at
the
others.
"I'm
going
to
pull
it
apart."
"Remember
the
vinegar,"
Langdon
whispered
with
fearful
exhilaration.
"Be
careful."
Sophie
knew
that
if
this
cryptex
were
like
those
she
had
opened
in
her
youth,
all
she
would
need
to
do
is
grip
the
cylinder
at
both
ends,
just
beyond
the
dials,
and
pull,
applying
slow,
steady
pressure
in
opposite
directions.
If
the
dials
were
properly
aligned
with
the
password,
then
one
of
the
ends
would
slide
off,
much
like
a
lens
cap,
and
she
could
reach
inside
and
remove
the
rolled
papyrus
document,
which
would
be
wrapped
around
the
vial
of
vinegar.
However,
if
the
password
they
had
entered
were
incorrect,
Sophie's
outward
force
on
the
ends
would
be
transferred
to
a
hinged
lever
inside,
which
would
pivot
downward
into
the
cavity
and
apply
pressure
to
the
glass
vial,
eventually
shattering
it
if
she
pulled
too
hard.
Pull
gently,
she
told
herself.
Teabing
and
Langdon
both
leaned
in
as
Sophie
wrapped
her
palms
around
the
ends
of
the
cylinder.
In
the
excitement
of
deciphering
the
code
word,
Sophie
had
almost
forgotten
what
they
expected
to
find
inside.
This
is
the
Priory
keystone.
According
to
Teabing,
it
contained
a
map
to
the
Holy
Grail,
unveiling
the
tomb
of
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
Sangreal
treasure
the
ultimate
treasure
trove
of
secret
truth.
Now
gripping
the
stone
tube,
Sophie
double
checked
that
all
of
the
letters
were
properly
aligned
with
the
indicator.
Then,
slowly,
she
pulled.
Nothing
happened.
She
applied
a
little
more
force.
Suddenly,
the
stone
slid
apart
like
a
well
crafted
telescope.
The
heavy
end
piece
detached
in
her
hand.
Langdon
and
Teabing
almost
jumped
to
their
feet.
Sophie's
heart
rate
climbed
as
she
set
the
end
cap
on
the
table
and
tipped
the
cylinder
to
peer
inside.
A
scroll!
Peering
down
the
hollow
of
the
rolled
paper,
Sophie
could
see
it
had
been
wrapped
around
a
cylindrical
object
the
vial
of
vinegar,
she
assumed.
Strangely,
though,
the
paper
around
the
vinegar
was
not
the
customary
delicate
papyrus
but
rather,
vellum.
That's
odd,
she
thought,
vinegar
can
't
dissolve
a
lambskin
vellum.
She
looked
again
down
the
hollow
of
the
scroll
and
realized
the
object
in
the
center
was
not
a
vial
of
vinegar
after
all.
It
was
something
else
entirely.
"What's
wrong?"
Teabing
asked.
"Pull
out
the
scroll."
Frowning,
Sophie
grabbed
the
rolled
vellum
and
the
object
around
which
it
was
wrapped,
pulling
them
both
out
of
the
container.
"That's
not
papyrus,"
Teabing
said.
"It's
too
heavy."
"I
know.
It's
padding."
"For
what?
The
vial
of
vinegar?"
"No."
Sophie
unrolled
the
scroll
and
revealed
what
was
wrapped
inside.
"For
this.
When
Langdon
saw
the
object
inside
the
sheet
of
vellum,
his
heart
sank.
"God
help
us,"
Teabing
said,
slumping.
"Your
grandfather
was
a
pitiless
architect."
Langdon
stared
in
amazement.
see
Sauniere
has
no
intention
of
making
this
easy.
On
the
table
sat
a
second
cryptex.
Smaller.
Made
of
black
onyx.
It
had
been
nested
within
the
first.
Sauniere's
passion
for
dualism.
Two
cryptexes.
Everything
in
pairs.
Double
entendres.
Male
female.
Black
nested
within
white.
Langdon
felt
the
web
of
symbolism
stretching
onward.
White
gives
birth
to
black.
Every
man
sprang
from
woman.
White
female.
Black
male.
Reaching
over,
Langdon
lifted
the
smaller
cryptex.
It
looked
identical
to
the
first,
except
half
the
size
and
black.
He
heard
the
familiar
gurgle.
Apparently,
the
vial
of
vinegar
they
had
heard
earlier
was
inside
this
smaller
cryptex.
"Well,
Robert,"
Teabing
said,
sliding
the
page
of
vellum
over
to
him.
"You'll
be
pleased
to
hear
that
at
least
we're
flying
in
the
right
direction."
Langdon
examined
the
thick
vellum
sheet.
Written
in
ornate
penmanship
was
another
four
line
verse.
Again,
in
iambic
pentameter.
The
verse
was
cryptic,
but
Langdon
needed
to
read
only
as
far
as
the
first
line
to
realize
that
Teabing's
plan
to
come
to
Britain
was
going
to
pay
off.
IN
LONDON
LIES
A
KNIGHT
A
POPE
INTERRED.
The
remainder
of
the
poem
clearly
implied
that
the
password
for
opening
the
second
cryptex
could
be
found
by
visiting
this
knight's
tomb,
somewhere
in
the
city.
Langdon
turned
excitedly
to
Teabing.
"Do
you
have
any
idea
what
knight
this
poem
is
referring
t0?
Teabing
grinned.
"Not
the
foggiest.
But
I
know
in
precisely
which
crypt
we
should
look."
At
that
moment,
fifteen
miles
ahead
of
them,
six
Kent
police
cars
streaked
down
rain
soaked
streets
toward
Biggin
Hill
Executive
Airport.
Lieutenant
Collet
helped
himself
to
a
Perrier
from
Teabing's
refrigerator
and
strode
back
out
through
the
drawing
room.
Rather
than
accompanying
Fache
to
London
where
the
action
was,
he
was
now
baby
sitting
the
PTS
team
that
had
spread
out
through
Chateau
Villette.
So
far,
the
evidence
they
had
uncovered
was
unhelpful:
a
single
bullet
buried
in
the
floor;
a
paper
with
several
symbols
scrawled
on
it
along
with
the
words
blade
and
chalice;
and
a
bloody
spiked
belt
that
PTS
had
told
Collet
was
associated
with
the
conservative
Catholic
group
Opus
Dei,
which
had
caused
a
stir
recently
when
a
news
program
exposed
their
aggressive
recruiting
practices
in
Paris.
Collet
sighed.
Good
luck
making
sense
of
this
unlikely
melange.
Moving
down
a
lavish
hallway,
Collet
entered
the
vast
ballroom
study,
where
the
chief
PTS
examiner
was
busy
dusting
for
fingerprints.
He
was
a
corpulent
man
in
suspenders.
"Anything?"
Collet
asked,
entering.
The
examiner
shook
his
head.
"Nothing
new.
Multiple
sets
matching
those
in
the
rest
of
the
house."
"How
about
the
prints
on
the
cilice
belt?"
"Interpol
is
still
working.
I
uploaded
everything
we
found."
Collet
motioned
to
two
sealed
evidence
bags
on
the
desk.
"And
this?"
The
man
shrugged.
"Force
of
habit.
I
bag
anything
peculiar."
Collet
walked
over.
Peculiar?
"This
Brit's
a
strange
one,"
the
examiner
said.
"Have
a
look
at
this."
He
sifted
through
the
evidence
bags
and
selected
one,
handing
it
to
Collet.
The
photo
showed
the
main
entrance
of
a
Gothic
cathedral
the
traditional,
recessed
archway,
narrowing
through
multiple,
ribbed
layers
to
a
small
doorway.
Collet
studied
the
photo
and
turned.
"This
is
peculiar?"
"Turn
it
over."
On
the
back,
Collet
found
notations
scrawled
in
English,
describing
a
cathedral's
long
hollow
nave
as
a
secret
pagan
tribute
to
a
woman's
womb.
This
was
strange.
The
notation
describing
the
cathedral's
doorway,
however,
was
what
startled
him.
"Hold
on!
He
thinks
a
cathedral's
entrance
represents
a
woman's"
The
examiner
nodded.
"Complete
with
receding
labial
ridges
and
a
nice
little
cinquefoil
clitoris
above
the
doorway."
He
sighed.
"Kind
of
makes
you
want
to
go
back
to
church."
Collet
picked
up
the
second
evidence
bag.
Through
the
plastic,
he
could
see
a
large
glossy
photograph
of
what
appeared
to
be
an
old
document.
The
heading
at
the
top
read:
Les
Dossiers
Secrets
Number
4
Im
1
249
"What's
this?"
Collet
asked.
"No
idea.
He's
got
copies
of
it
all
over
the
place,
so
I
bagged
it."
Collet
studied
the
document.

?
Collet
wondered.
"Lieutenant?"
Another
agent
stuck
his
head
in.
"The
switchboard
has
an
urgent
call
for
Captain
Fache,
but
they
can't
reach
him.
Will
you
take
it?"
Collet
returned
to
the
kitchen
and
took
the
call.
It
was
Andre
Vernet.
The
banker's
refined
accent
did
little
to
mask
the
tension
in
his
voice.
"I
thought
Captain
Fache
said
he
would
call
me,
but
I
have
not
yet
heard
from
him."
"The
captain
is
quite
busy,"
Collet
replied.
"May
I
help
you?"
"I
was
assured
I
would
be
kept
abreast
of
your
progress
tonight."
For
a
moment,
Collet
thought
he
recognized
the
timbre
of
the
man's
voice,
but
he
couldn't
quite
place
it.
"Monsieur
Vernet,
I
am
currently
in
charge
of
the
Paris
investigation.
My
name
is
Lieutenant
Collet."
There
was
a
long
pause
on
the
line.
"Lieutenant,
I
have
another
call
coming
in.
Please
excuse
me.
I
will
call
you
later."
He
hung
up.
For
several
seconds,
Collet
held
the
receiver.
Then
it
dawned
on
him.
knew
I
recognized
that
voice!
The
revelation
made
him
gasp.
The
armored
car
driver.
With
the
fake
Rolex.
Collet
now
understood
why
the
banker
had
hung
up
so
quickly.
Vernet
had
remembered
the
name
Lieutenant
Collet
the
officer
he
blatantly
lied
to
earlier
tonight.
Collet
pondered
the
implications
of
this
bizarre
development.
Vernet
is
involved.
Instinctively,
he
knew
he
should
call
Fache.
Emotionally,
he
knew
this
lucky
break
was
going
to
be
his
moment
to
shine.
He
immediately
called
Interpol
and
requested
every
shred
of
information
they
could
find
on
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
and
its
president,
Andre
Vernet.
"Seat
belts,
please,"
Teabing's
pilot
announced
as
the
Hawker
731
descended
into
a
gloomy
morning
drizzle.
"We'll
be
landing
in
five
minutes."
Teabing
felt
a
joyous
sense
of
homecoming
when
he
saw
the
misty
hills
of
Kent
spreading
wide
beneath
the
descending
plane.
England
was
less
than
an
hour
from
Paris,
and
yet
a
world
away.
This
morning,
the
damp,
spring
green
of
his
homeland
looked
particularly
welcoming.
My
time
in
France
is
over.
I
am
returning
to
England
victorious.
The
keystone
has
been
found.
The
question
remained,
of
course,
as
to
where
the
keystone
would
ultimately
lead.
Somewhere
in
the
United
Kingdom.
Where
exactly,
Teabing
had
no
idea,
but
he
was
already
tasting
the
glory.
As
Langdon
and
Sophie
looked
on,
Teabing
got
up
and
went
to
the
far
side
of
the
cabin,
then
slid
aside
a
wall
panel
to
reveal
a
discreetly
hidden
wall
safe.
He
dialed
in
the
combination,
opened
the
safe,
and
extracted
two
passports.
"Documentation
for
Rimy
and
myself."
He
then
removed
a
thick
stack
of
fifty
pound
notes.
"And
documentation
for
you
two."
Sophie
looked
leery.
"A
bribe?"
"Creative
diplomacy.
Executive
airfields
make
certain
allowances.
A
British
customs
official
will
greet
us
at
my
hangar
and
ask
to
board
the
plane.
Rather
than
permitting
him
to
come
on,
I'll
tell
him
I'm
traveling
with
a
French
celebrity
who
prefers
that
nobody
knows
she
is
in
England
press
considerations,
you
know
and
I'll
offer
the
official
this
generous
tip
as
gratitude
for
his
discretion."
Langdon
looked
amazed.
"And
the
official
will
accept?"
"Not
from
anyone,
they
won't,
but
these
people
all
know
me.
I'm
not
an
arms
dealer,
for
heaven's
sake.
I
was
knighted."
Teabing
smiled.
"Membership
has
its
privileges."
Remy
approached
up
the
aisle
now,
the
Heckler
Koch
pistol
cradled
in
his
hand.
"Sir,
my
agenda?"
Teabing
glanced
at
his
servant.
"I'm
going
to
have
you
stay
onboard
with
our
guest
until
we
return.
We
can't
very
well
drag
him
all
over
London
with
us."
Sophie
looked
wary.
"Leigh,
I
was
serious
about
the
French
police
finding
your
plane
before
we
return.
Teabing
laughed.
"Yes,
imagine
their
surprise
if
they
board
and
find
Remy."
Sophie
looked
surprised
by
his
cavalier
attitude.
"Leigh,
you
transported
a
bound
hostage
across
international
borders.
This
is
serious."
"So
are
my
lawyers."
He
scowled
toward
the
monk
in
the
rear
of
the
plane.
"That
animal
broke
into
my
home
and
almost
killed
me.
That
is
a
fact,
and
Remy
will
corroborate."
"But
you
tied
him
up
and
flew
him
to
London!"
Langdon
said.
Teabing
held
up
his
right
hand
and
feigned
a
courtroom
oath.
"Your
honor,
forgive
an
eccentric
old
knight
his
foolish
prejudice
for
the
British
court
system.
I
realize
I
should
have
called
the
French
authorities,
but
I'm
a
snob
and
do
not
trust
those
laissez
faire
French
to
prosecute
properly.
This
man
almost
murdered
me.
Yes,
I
made
a
rash
decision
forcing
my
manservant
to
help
me
bring
him
to
England,
but
I
was
under
great
stress.
Mea
culpa.
Mea
culpa."
Langdon
looked
incredulous.
"Coming
from
you,
Leigh,
that
just
might
fly."
"Sir?"
the
pilot
called
back.
"The
tower
just
radioed.
They've
got
some
kind
of
maintenance
problem
out
near
your
hangar,
and
they're
asking
me
to
bring
the
plane
directly
to
the
terminal
instead."
Teabing
had
been
flying
to
Biggin
Hill
for
over
a
decade,
and
this
was
a
first.
"Did
they
mention
what
the
problem
is?"
"The
controller
was
vague.
Something
about
a
gas
leak
at
the
pumping
station?
They
asked
me
to
park
in
front
of
the
terminal
and
keep
everyone
onboard
until
further
notice.
Safety
precaution.
We're
not
supposed
to
deplane
until
we
get
the
all
clear
from
airport
authorities."
Teabing
was
skeptical.
Must
be
one
hell
of
a
gas
leak.
The
pumping
station
was
a
good
half
mile
from
his
hangar.
Remy
also
looked
concerned.
"Sir,
this
sounds
highly
irregular."
Teabing
turned
to
Sophie
and
Langdon.
"My
friends,
I
have
an
unpleasant
suspicion
that
we
are
about
to
be
met
by
a
welcoming
committee."
Langdon
gave
a
bleak
sigh.
"I
guess
Fache
still
thinks
I'm
his
man."
"Either
that,"
Sophie
said,
"or
he
is
too
deep
into
this
to
admit
his
error.
Teabing
was
not
listening.
Regardless
of
Fache's
mind
set,
action
needed
to
be
taken
fast.
Don't
lose
sight
of
the
ultimate
goal.
The
Grail.
We're
so
dose.
Below
them,
the
landing
gear
descended
with
a
clunk.
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
sounding
deeply
remorseful,
"I
should
turn
myself
in
and
sort
this
out
legally.
Leave
you
all
out
of
it.
"Oh,
heavens,
Robert!"
Teabing
waved
it
off.
"Do
you
really
think
they're
going
to
let
the
rest
of
us
go?
I
just
transported
you
illegally.
Miss
Neveu
assisted
in
your
escape
from
the
Louvre,
and
we
have
a
man
tied
up
in
the
back
of
the
plane.
Really
now!
We're
all
in
this
together."
"Maybe
a
different
airport?"
Sophie
said.
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"If
we
pull
up
now,
by
the
time
we
get
clearance
anywhere
else,
our
welcoming
party
will
include
army
tanks."
Sophie
slumped.
Teabing
sensed
that
if
they
were
to
have
any
chance
of
postponing
confrontation
with
the
British
authorities
long
enough
to
find
the
Grail,
bold
action
had
to
be
taken.
"Give
me
a
minute,"
he
said,
hobbling
toward
the
cockpit.
"What
are
you
doing?"
Langdon
asked.
"Sales
meeting,"
Teabing
said,
wondering
how
much
it
would
cost
him
to
persuade
his
pilot
to
perform
one
highly
irregular
maneuver.
The
Hawker
is
on
final
approach.
Simon
Edwards
Executive
Services
Officer
at
Biggin
Hill
Airport
paced
the
control
tower,
squinting
nervously
at
the
rain
drenched
runway.
He
never
appreciated
being
awoken
early
on
a
Saturday
morning,
but
it
was
particularly
distasteful
that
he
had
been
called
in
to
oversee
the
arrest
of
one
of
his
most
lucrative
clients.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
paid
Biggin
Hill
not
only
for
a
private
hangar
but
a
"per
landing
fee"
for
his
frequent
arrivals
and
departures.
Usually,
the
airfield
had
advance
warning
of
his
schedule
and
was
able
to
follow
a
strict
protocol
for
his
arrival.
Teabing
liked
things
just
so.
The
custom
built
Jaguar
stretch
limousine
that
he
kept
in
his
hangar
was
to
be
fully
gassed,
polished,
and
the
day's
London
Times
laid
out
on
the
back
seat.
A
customs
official
was
to
be
waiting
for
the
plane
at
the
hangar
to
expedite
the
mandatory
documentation
and
luggage
check.
Occasionally,
customs
agents
accepted
large
tips
from
Teabing
in
exchange
for
turning
a
blind
eye
to
the
transport
of
harmless
organics
mostly
luxury
foods
French
escargots,
a
particularly
ripe
unprocessed
Roquefort,
certain
fruits.
Many
customs
laws
were
absurd,
anyway,
and
if
Biggin
Hill
didn't
accommodate
its
clients,
certainly
competing
airfields
would.
Teabing
was
provided
with
what
he
wanted
here
at
Biggin
Hill,
and
the
employees
reaped
the
benefits.
Edwards's
nerves
felt
frayed
now
as
he
watched
the
jet
coming
in.
He
wondered
if
Teabing's
penchant
for
spreading
the
wealth
had
gotten
him
in
trouble
somehow;
the
French
authorities
seemed
very
intent
on
containing
him.
Edwards
had
not
yet
been
told
what
the
charges
were,
but
they
were
obviously
serious.
At
the
French
authorities'
request,
Kent
police
had
ordered
the
Biggin
Hill
air
traffic
controller
to
radio
the
Hawker's
pilot
and
order
him
directly
to
the
terminal
rather
than
to
the
client's
hangar.
The
pilot
had
agreed,
apparently
believing
the
far
fetched
story
of
a
gas
leak.
Though
the
British
police
did
not
generally
carry
weapons,
the
gravity
of
the
situation
had
brought
out
an
armed
response
team.
Now,
eight
policemen
with
handguns
stood
just
inside
the
terminal
building,
awaiting
the
moment
when
the
plane's
engines
powered
down.
The
instant
this
happened,
a
runway
attendant
would
place
safety
wedges
under
the
tires
so
the
plane
could
no
longer
move.
Then
the
police
would
step
into
view
and
hold
the
occupants
at
bay
until
the
French
police
arrived
to
handle
the
situation.
The
Hawker
was
low
in
the
sky
now,
skimming
the
treetops
to
their
right.
Simon
Edwards
went
downstairs
to
watch
the
landing
from
tarmac
level.
The
Kent
police
were
poised,
just
out
of
sight,
and
the
maintenance
man
waited
with
his
wedges.
Out
on
the
runway,
the
Hawker's
nose
tipped
up,
and
the
tires
touched
down
in
a
puff
of
smoke.
The
plane
settled
in
for
deceleration,
streaking
from
right
to
left
in
front
of
the
terminal,
its
white
hull
glistening
in
the
wet
weather.
But
rather
than
braking
and
turning
into
the
terminal,
the
jet
coasted
calmly
past
the
access
lane
and
continued
on
toward
Teabing's
hangar
in
the
distance.
All
the
police
spun
and
stared
at
Edwards.
"I
thought
you
said
the
pilot
agreed
to
come
to
the
terminal
!
Edwards
was
bewildered.
"He
did!"
Seconds
later,
Edwards
found
himself
wedged
in
a
police
car
racing
across
the
tarmac
toward
the
distant
hangar.
The
convoy
of
police
was
still
a
good
five
hundred
yards
away
as
Teabing's
Hawker
taxied
calmly
into
the
private
hangar
and
disappeared.
When
the
cars
finally
arrived
and
skidded
to
a
stop
outside
the
gaping
hangar
door,
the
police
poured
out,
guns
drawn.
Edwards
jumped
out
too.
The
noise
was
deafening.
The
Hawker's
engines
were
still
roaring
as
the
jet
finished
its
usual
rotation
inside
the
hangar,
positioning
itself
nose
out
in
preparation
for
later
departure.
As
the
plane
completed
its
180
degree
turn
and
rolled
toward
the
front
of
the
hangar,
Edwards
could
see
the
pilot's
face,
which
understandably
looked
surprised
and
fearful
to
see
the
barricade
of
police
cars.
The
pilot
brought
the
plane
to
a
final
stop,
and
powered
down
the
engines.
The
police
streamed
in,
taking
up
positions
around
the
jet.
Edwards
joined
the
Kent
chief
inspector,
who
moved
warily
toward
the
hatch.
After
several
seconds,
the
fuselage
door
popped
open.
Leigh
Teabing
appeared
in
the
doorway
as
the
plane's
electronic
stairs
smoothly
dropped
down.
As
he
gazed
out
at
the
sea
of
weapons
aimed
at
him,
he
propped
himself
on
his
crutches
and
scratched
his
head.
"Simon,
did
I
win
the
policemen's
lottery
while
I
was
away?"
He
sounded
more
bewildered
than
concerned.
Simon
Edwards
stepped
forward,
swallowing
the
frog
in
his
throat.
"Good
morning,
sir.
I
apologize
for
the
confusion.
We've
had
a
gas
leak
and
your
pilot
said
he
was
coming
to
the
terminal."
"Yes,
yes,
well,
I
told
him
to
come
here
instead.
I'm
late
for
an
appointment.
I
pay
for
this
hangar,
and
this
rubbish
about
avoiding
a
gas
leak
sounded
overcautious."
"I'm
afraid
your
arrival
has
taken
us
a
bit
off
guard,
sir."
"I
know.
I'm
off
my
schedule,
I
am.
Between
you
and
me,
the
new
medication
gives
me
the
tinkles.
Thought
I'd
come
over
for
a
tune
up."
The
policemen
all
exchanged
looks.
Edwards
winced.
"Very
good,
sir."
"Sir,"
the
Kent
chief
inspector
said,
stepping
forward.
"I
need
to
ask
you
to
stay
onboard
for
another
half
hour
or
so."
Teabing
looked
unamused
as
he
hobbled
down
the
stairs.
"I'm
afraid
that
is
impossible.
I
have
a
medical
appointment."
He
reached
the
tarmac.
"I
cannot
afford
to
miss
it."
The
chief
inspector
repositioned
himself
to
block
Teabing's
progress
away
from
the
plane.
"I
am
here
at
the
orders
of
the
French
Judicial
Police.
They
claim
you
are
transporting
fugitives
from
the
law
on
this
plane."
Teabing
stared
at
the
chief
inspector
a
long
moment,
and
then
burst
out
laughing.
"Is
this
one
of
those
hidden
camera
programs?
Jolly
good!"
The
chief
inspector
never
flinched.
"This
is
serious,
sir.
The
French
police
claim
you
also
may
have
a
hostage
onboard."
Teabing's
manservant
Remy
appeared
in
the
doorway
at
the
top
of
the
stairs.
"I
feel
like
a
hostage
working
for
Sir
Leigh,
but
he
assures
me
I
am
free
to
go."
Remy
checked
his
watch.
"Master,
we
really
are
running
late."
He
nodded
toward
the
Jaguar
stretch
limousine
in
the
far
corner
of
the
hangar.
The
enormous
automobile
was
ebony
with
smoked
glass
and
whitewall
tires.
"I'll
bring
the
car."
Remy
started
down
the
stairs.
"I'm
afraid
we
cannot
let
you
leave,"
the
chief
inspector
said.
"Please
return
to
your
aircraft.
Both
of
you.
Representatives
from
the
French
police
will
be
landing
shortly."
Teabing
looked
now
toward
Simon
Edwards.
"Simon,
for
heaven's
sake,
this
is
ridiculous!
We
don't
have
anyone
else
on
board.
Just
the
usual
Remy,
our
pilot,
and
myself.
Perhaps
you
could
act
as
an
intermediary?
Go
have
a
look
onboard,
and
verify
that
the
plane
is
empty."
Edwards
knew
he
was
trapped.
"Yes,
sir.
I
can
have
a
look."
"The
devil
you
will!"
the
Kent
chief
inspector
declared,
apparently
knowing
enough
about
executive
airfields
to
suspect
Simon
Edwards
might
well
lie
about
the
plane's
occupants
in
an
effort
to
keep
Teabing's
business
at
Biggin
Hill.
"I
will
look
myself."
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"No
you
won't,
Inspector.
This
is
private
property
and
until
you
have
a
search
warrant,
you
will
stay
off
my
plane.
I
am
offering
you
a
reasonable
option
here.
Mr.
Edwards
can
perform
the
inspection."
"No
deal."
Teabing's
demeanor
turned
frosty.
"Inspector,
I'm
afraid
I
don't
have
time
to
indulge
in
your
games.
I'm
late,
and
I'm
leaving.
If
it
is
that
important
to
you
to
stop
me,
you'll
just
have
to
shoot
me."
With
that,
Teabing
and
Remy
walked
around
the
chief
inspector
and
headed
across
the
hangar
toward
the
parked
limousine.
The
Kent
chief
inspector
felt
only
distaste
for
Leigh
Teabing
as
the
man
hobbled
around
him
in
defiance.
Men
of
privilege
always
felt
like
they
were
above
the
law.
They
are
not.
The
chief
inspector
turned
and
aimed
at
Teabing's
back.
"Stop!
I
will
fire!"
"Go
ahead,"
Teabing
said
without
breaking
stride
or
glancing
back.
"My
lawyers
will
fricassee
your
testicles
for
breakfast.
And
if
you
dare
board
my
plane
without
a
warrant,
your
spleen
will
follow."
No
stranger
to
power
plays,
the
chief
inspector
was
unimpressed.
Technically,
Teabing
was
correct
and
the
police
needed
a
warrant
to
board
his
jet,
but
because
the
flight
had
originated
in
France,
and
because
the
powerful
Bezu
Fache
had
given
his
authority,
the
Kent
chief
inspector
felt
certain
his
career
would
be
far
better
served
by
finding
out
what
it
was
on
this
plane
that
Teabing
seemed
so
intent
on
hiding.
"Stop
them,"
the
inspector
ordered.
"I'm
searching
the
plane."
His
men
raced
over,
guns
leveled,
and
physically
blocked
Teabing
and
his
servant
from
reaching
the
limousine.
Now
Teabing
turned.
"Inspector,
this
is
your
last
warning.
Do
not
even
think
of
boarding
that
plane.
You
will
regret
it."
Ignoring
the
threat,
the
chief
inspector
gripped
his
sidearm
and
marched
up
the
plane's
gangway.
Arriving
at
the
hatch,
he
peered
inside.
After
a
moment,
he
stepped
into
the
cabin.
What
the
devil?
With
the
exception
of
the
frightened
looking
pilot
in
the
cockpit,
the
aircraft
was
empty.
Entirely
devoid
of
human
life.
Quickly
checking
the
bathroom,
the
chairs,
and
the
luggage
areas,
the
inspector
found
no
traces
of
anyone
hiding
much
less
multiple
individuals.
What
the
hell
was
Bezu
Fache
thinking?
It
seemed
Leigh
Teabing
had
been
telling
the
truth.
The
Kent
chief
inspector
stood
alone
in
the
deserted
cabin
and
swallowed
hard.
Shit.
His
face
flushed,
he
stepped
back
onto
the
gangway,
gazing
across
the
hangar
at
Leigh
Teabing
and
his
servant,
who
were
now
under
gunpoint
near
the
limousine.
"Let
them
go,"
the
inspector
ordered.
"We
received
a
bad
tip."
Teabing's
eyes
were
menacing
even
across
the
hangar.
"You
can
expect
a
call
from
my
lawyers.
And
for
future
reference,
the
French
police
cannot
be
trusted.
With
that,
Teabing's
manservant
opened
the
door
at
the
rear
of
the
stretch
limousine
and
helped
his
crippled
master
into
the
back
seat.
Then
the
servant
walked
the
length
of
the
car,
climbed
in
behind
the
wheel,
and
gunned
the
engine.
Policemen
scattered
as
the
Jaguar
peeled
out
of
the
hangar.
"Well
played,
my
good
man,"
Teabing
chimed
from
the
rear
seat
as
the
limousine
accelerated
out
of
the
airport.
He
turned
his
eyes
now
to
the
dimly
lit
front
recesses
of
the
spacious
interior.
"Everyone
comfy?"
Langdon
gave
a
weak
nod.
He
and
Sophie
were
still
crouched
on
the
floor
beside
the
bound
and
gagged
albino.
Moments
earlier,
as
the
Hawker
taxied
into
the
deserted
hangar,
Remy
had
popped
the
hatch
as
the
plane
jolted
to
a
stop
halfway
through
its
turn.
With
the
police
closing
in
fast,
Langdon
and
Sophie
dragged
the
monk
down
the
gangway
to
ground
level
and
out
of
sight
behind
the
limousine.
Then
the
jet
engines
had
roared
again,
rotating
the
plane
and
completing
its
turn
as
the
police
cars
came
skidding
into
the
hangar.
Now,
as
the
limousine
raced
toward
Kent,
Langdon
and
Sophie
clambered
toward
the
rear
of
the
limo's
long
interior,
leaving
the
monk
bound
on
the
floor.
They
settled
onto
the
long
seat
facing
Teabing.
The
Brit
gave
them
both
a
roguish
smile
and
opened
the
cabinet
on
the
limo's
bar.
"Could
I
offer
you
a
drink?
Some
nibblies?
Crisps?
Nuts?
Seltzer?"
Sophie
and
Langdon
both
shook
their
heads.
Teabing
grinned
and
closed
the
bar.
"So
then,
about
this
knight's
tomb"
"Fleet
Street?"
Langdon
asked,
eyeing
Teabing
in
the
back
of
the
limo.
There's
a
crypt
on
Fleet
Street?
So
far,
Leigh
was
being
playfully
cagey
about
where
he
thought
they
would
find
the
"knight's
tomb,"
which,
according
to
the
poem,
would
provide
the
password
for
opening
the
smaller
cryptex.
Teabing
grinned
and
turned
to
Sophie.
"Miss
Neveu,
give
the
Harvard
boy
one
more
shot
at
the
verse,
will
you?"
Sophie
fished
in
her
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
black
cryptex,
which
was
wrapped
in
the
vellum.
Everyone
had
decided
to
leave
the
rosewood
box
and
larger
cryptex
behind
in
the
plane's
strongbox,
carrying
with
them
only
what
they
needed,
the
far
more
portable
and
discreet
black
cryptex.
Sophie
unwrapped
the
vellum
and
handed
the
sheet
to
Langdon.
Although
Langdon
had
read
the
poem
several
times
onboard
the
jet,
he
had
been
unable
to
extract
any
specific
location.
Now,
as
he
read
the
words
again,
he
processed
them
slowly
and
carefully,
hoping
the
pentametric
rhythms
would
reveal
a
clearer
meaning
now
that
he
was
on
the
ground.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
His
labor's
fruit
a
Holy
wrath
incurred.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
The
language
seemed
simple
enough.
There
was
a
knight
buried
in
London.
A
knight
who
labored
at
something
that
angered
the
Church.
A
knight
whose
tomb
was
missing
an
orb
that
should
be
present.
The
poem's
final
reference
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb
was
a
clear
allusion
to
Mary
Magdalene,
the
Rose
who
bore
the
seed
of
Jesus.
Despite
the
apparent
straightforwardness
of
the
verse,
Langdon
still
had
no
idea
who
this
knight
was
or
where
he
was
buried.
Moreover,
once
they
located
the
tomb,
it
sounded
as
if
they
would
be
searching
for
something
that
was
absent.
The
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb
?
"No
thoughts?"
Teabing
clucked
in
disappointment,
although
Langdon
sensed
the
Royal
Historian
was
enjoying
being
one
up.
"Miss
Neveu?"
She
shook
her
head.
"What
would
you
two
do
without
me?"
Teabing
said.
"Very
well,
I
will
walk
you
through
it.
It's
quite
simple
really.
The
first
line
is
the
key.
Would
you
read
it
please?"
Langdon
read
aloud.
"
'In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.'
"Precisely.
A
knight
a
Pope
interred."
He
eyed
Langdon.
"What
does
that
mean
to
you?"
Langdon
shrugged.
"A
knight
buried
by
a
Pope?
A
knight
whose
funeral
was
presided
over
by
a
Pope?"
Teabing
laughed
loudly.
"Oh,
that's
rich.
Always
the
optimist,
Robert.
Look
at
the
second
line.
This
knight
obviously
did
something
that
incurred
the
Holy
wrath
of
the
Church.
Think
again.
Consider
the
dynamic
between
the
Church
and
the
Knights
Templar.
A
knight
a
Pope
interred?"
"A
knight
a
Pope
killed?"
Sophie
asked.
Teabing
smiled
and
patted
her
knee.
"Well
done,
my
dear.
A
knight
a
Pope
buried.
Or
killed."
Langdon
thought
of
the
notorious
Templar
round
up
in
1307
unlucky
Friday
the
thirteenth
when
Pope
Clement
killed
and
interred
hundreds
of
Knights
Templar.
"But
there
must
be
endless
graves
of
'knights
killed
by
Popes.'
"Aha,
not
so!
"Teabing
said.
"Many
of
them
were
burned
at
the
stake
and
tossed
unceremoniously
into
the
Tiber
River.
But
this
poem
refers
to
a
tomb.
A
tomb
in
London.
And
there
are
few
knights
buried
in
London.
"
He
paused,
eyeing
Langdon
as
if
waiting
for
light
to
dawn.
Finally
he
huffed.
"Robert,
for
heaven's
sake!
The
church
built
in
London
by
the
Priory's
military
arm
the
Knights
Templar
themselves
!
"The
Temple
Church?"
Langdon
drew
a
startled
breath.
"It
has
a
crypt?"
"Ten
of
the
most
frightening
tombs
you
will
ever
see."
Langdon
had
never
actually
visited
the
Temple
Church,
although
he'd
come
across
numerous
references
in
his
Priory
research.
Once
the
epicenter
of
all
TemplarPriory
activities
in
the
United
Kingdom,
the
Temple
Church
had
been
so
named
in
honor
of
Solomon's
Temple,
from
which
the
Knights
Templar
had
extracted
their
own
title,
as
well
as
the
Sangreal
documents
that
gave
them
all
their
influence
in
Rome.
Tales
abounded
of
knights
performing
strange,
secretive
rituals
within
the
Temple
Church's
unusual
sanctuary.
"The
Temple
Church
is
on
Fleet
Street?"
"Actually,
it's
just
off
Fleet
Street
on
Inner
Temple
Lane."
Teabing
looked
mischievous.
"I
wanted
to
see
you
sweat
a
little
more
before
I
gave
it
away."
"Thanks."
"Neither
of
you
has
ever
been
there?"
Sophie
and
Langdon
shook
their
heads.
"I'm
not
surprised,"
Teabing
said.
"The
church
is
hidden
now
behind
much
larger
buildings.
Few
people
even
know
it's
there.
Eerie
old
place.
The
architecture
is
pagan
to
the
core."
Sophie
looked
surprised.
"Pagan?"
"Pantheonically
pagan!"
Teabing
exclaimed.
"The
church
is
round.
The
Templars
ignored
the
traditional
Christian
cruciform
layout
and
built
a
perfectly
circular
church
in
honor
of
the
sun."
His
eyebrows
did
a
devilish
dance.
"A
not
so
subtle
howdy
do
to
the
boys
in
Rome.
They
might
as
well
have
resurrected
Stonehenge
in
downtown
London."
Sophie
eyed
Teabing.
"What
about
the
rest
of
the
poem?"
The
historian's
mirthful
air
faded.
"I'm
not
sure.
It's
puzzling.
We
will
need
to
examine
each
of
the
ten
tombs
carefully.
With
luck,
one
of
them
will
have
a
conspicuously
absent
orb."
Langdon
realized
how
close
they
really
were.
If
the
missing
orb
revealed
the
password,
they
would
be
able
to
open
the
second
cryptex.
He
had
a
hard
time
imagining
what
they
might
find
inside.
Langdon
eyed
the
poem
again.
It
was
like
some
kind
of
primordial
crossword
puzzle.
A
five
letter
word
that
speaks
of
the
Grail?
On
the
plane,
they
had
already
tried
all
the
obvious
passwords
GRAIL,
GRAAL,
GREAL,
VENUS,
MARIA,
JESUS,
SARAH
but
the
cylinder
had
not
budged.
Far
too
obvious.
Apparently
there
existed
some
other
five
letter
reference
to
the
Rose's
seeded
womb.
The
fact
that
the
word
was
eluding
a
specialist
like
Leigh
Teabing
signified
to
Langdon
that
it
was
no
ordinary
Grail
reference.
"Sir
Leigh?"
Remy
called
over
his
shoulder.
He
was
watching
them
in
the
rearview
mirror
through
the
open
divider.
"You
said
Fleet
Street
is
near
Blackfriars
Bridge?"
"Yes,
take
Victoria
Embankment."
"I'm
sorry.
I'm
not
sure
where
that
is.
We
usually
go
only
to
the
hospital."
Teabing
rolled
his
eyes
at
Langdon
and
Sophie
and
grumbled,
"I
swear,
sometimes
it's
like
baby
sitting
a
child.
One
moment
please.
Help
yourself
to
a
drink
and
savory
snacks."
He
left
them,
clambering
awkwardly
toward
the
open
divider
to
talk
to
Remy.
Sophie
turned
to
Langdon
now,
her
voice
quiet.
"Robert,
nobody
knows
you
and
I
are
in
England."
Langdon
realized
she
was
right.
The
Kent
police
would
tell
Fache
the
plane
was
empty,
and
Fache
would
have
to
assume
they
were
still
in
France.
We
are
invisible.
Leigh's
little
stunt
had
just
bought
them
a
lot
of
time.
"Fache
will
not
give
up
easily,"
Sophie
said.
"He
has
too
much
riding
on
this
arrest
now."
Langdon
had
been
trying
not
to
think
about
Fache.
Sophie
had
promised
she
would
do
everything
in
her
power
to
exonerate
Langdon
once
this
was
over,
but
Langdon
was
starting
to
fear
it
might
not
matter.
Fache
could
easily
be
pan
of
this
plot.
Although
Langdon
could
not
imagine
the
Judicial
Police
tangled
up
in
the
Holy
Grail,
he
sensed
too
much
coincidence
tonight
to
disregard
Fache
as
a
possible
accomplice.
Fache
is
religions,
and
he
is
intent
on
pinning
these
murders
on
me.
Then
again,
Sophie
had
argued
that
Fache
might
simply
be
overzealous
to
make
the
arrest.
After
all,
the
evidence
against
Langdon
was
substantial.
In
addition
to
Langdon's
name
scrawled
on
the
Louvre
floor
and
in
Sauniere's
date
book,
Langdon
now
appeared
to
have
lied
about
his
manuscript
and
then
run
away.
At
Sophie
's
suggestion.
"Robert,
I'm
sorry
you're
so
deeply
involved,"
Sophie
said,
placing
her
hand
on
his
knee.
"But
I'm
very
glad
you're
here."
The
comment
sounded
more
pragmatic
than
romantic,
and
yet
Langdon
felt
an
unexpected
flicker
of
attraction
between
them.
He
gave
her
a
tired
smile.
"I'm
a
lot
more
fun
when
I've
slept."
Sophie
was
silent
for
several
seconds.
"My
grandfather
asked
me
to
trust
you.
I'm
glad
I
listened
to
him
for
once."
"Your
grandfather
didn't
even
know
me."
"Even
so,
I
can't
help
but
think
you've
done
everything
he
would
have
wanted.
You
helped
me
find
the
keystone,
explained
the
Sangreal,
told
me
about
the
ritual
in
the
basement."
She
paused.
"Somehow
I
feel
closer
to
my
grandfather
tonight
than
I
have
in
years.
I
know
he
would
be
happy
about
that."
In
the
distance,
now,
the
skyline
of
London
began
to
materialize
through
the
dawn
drizzle.
Once
dominated
by
Big
Ben
and
Tower
Bridge,
the
horizon
now
bowed
to
the
Millennium
Eye
a
colossal,
ultramodern
Ferris
wheel
that
climbed
five
hundred
feet
and
afforded
breathtaking
views
of
the
city.
Langdon
had
attempted
to
board
it
once,
but
the
"viewing
capsules"
reminded
him
of
sealed
sarcophagi,
and
he
opted
to
keep
his
feet
on
the
ground
and
enjoy
the
view
from
the
airy
banks
of
the
Thames.
Langdon
felt
a
squeeze
on
his
knee,
pulling
him
back,
and
Sophie's
green
eyes
were
on
him.
He
realized
she
had
been
speaking
to
him.
"What
do
you
think
we
should
do
with
the
Sangreal
documents
if
we
ever
find
them?"
she
whispered.
"What
I
think
is
immaterial,"
Langdon
said.
"Your
grandfather
gave
the
cryptex
to
you,
and
you
should
do
with
it
what
your
instinct
tells
you
he
would
want
done."
"I'm
asking
for
your
opinion.
You
obviously
wrote
something
in
that
manuscript
that
made
my
grandfather
trust
your
judgment.
He
scheduled
a
private
meeting
with
you.
That's
rare."
"Maybe
he
wanted
to
tell
me
I
have
it
all
wrong."
"Why
would
he
tell
me
to
find
you
unless
he
liked
your
ideas?
In
your
manuscript,
did
you
support
the
idea
that
the
Sangreal
documents
should
be
revealed
or
stay
buried?"
"Neither.
I
made
no
judgment
either
way.
The
manuscript
deals
with
the
symbology
of
the
sacred
feminine
tracing
her
iconography
throughout
history.
I
certainly
didn't
presume
to
know
where
the
Grail
is
hidden
or
whether
it
should
ever
be
revealed.
"And
yet
you're
writing
a
book
about
it,
so
you
obviously
feel
the
information
should
be
shared."
"There's
an
enormous
difference
between
hypothetically
discussing
an
alternate
history
of
Christ,
and"
He
paused.
"And
what?"
"And
presenting
to
the
world
thousands
of
ancient
documents
as
scientific
evidence
that
the
New
Testament
is
false
testimony."
"But
you
told
me
the
New
Testament
is
based
on
fabrications."
Langdon
smiled.
"Sophie,
every
faith
in
the
world
is
based
on
fabrication.
That
is
the
definition
of
faith
acceptance
of
that
which
we
imagine
to
be
true,
that
which
we
cannot
prove.
Every
religion
describes
God
through
metaphor,
allegory,
and
exaggeration,
from
the
early
Egyptians
through
modern
Sunday
school.
Metaphors
are
a
way
to
help
our
minds
process
the
unprocessible.
The
problems
arise
when
we
begin
to
believe
literally
in
our
own
metaphors."
"So
you
are
in
favor
of
the
Sangreal
documents
staying
buried
forever?"
"I'm
a
historian.
I'm
opposed
to
the
destruction
of
documents,
and
I
would
love
to
see
religious
scholars
have
more
information
to
ponder
the
exceptional
life
of
Jesus
Christ."
"You're
arguing
both
sides
of
my
question."
"Am
I?
The
Bible
represents
a
fundamental
guidepost
for
millions
of
people
on
the
planet,
in
much
the
same
way
the
Koran,
Torah,
and
Pali
Canon
offer
guidance
to
people
of
other
religions.
If
you
and
I
could
dig
up
documentation
that
contradicted
the
holy
stories
of
Islamic
belief,
Judaic
belief,
Buddhist
belief,
pagan
belief,
should
we
do
that?
Should
we
wave
a
flag
and
tell
the
Buddhists
that
we
have
proof
the
Buddha
did
not
come
from
a
lotus
blossom?
Or
that
Jesus
was
not
born
of
a
literal
virgin
birth?
Those
who
truly
understand
their
faiths
understand
the
stories
are
metaphorical."
Sophie
looked
skeptical.
"My
friends
who
are
devout
Christians
definitely
believe
that
Christ
literally
walked
on
water,
literally
turned
water
into
wine,
and
was
born
of
a
literal
virgin
birth."
"My
point
exactly,"
Langdon
said.
"Religious
allegory
has
become
apart
of
the
fabric
of
reality.
And
living
in
that
reality
helps
millions
of
people
cope
and
be
better
people."
"But
it
appears
their
reality
is
false."
Langdon
chuckled.
"No
more
false
than
that
of
a
mathematical
cryptographer
who
believes
in
the
imaginary
number
'V
because
it
helps
her
break
codes."
Sophie
frowned.
"That's
not
fair."
A
moment
passed.
"What
was
your
question
again?"
Langdon
asked.
"I
can't
remember."
He
smiled.
"Works
every
time."
Langdon's
Mickey
Mouse
wristwatch
read
almost
seven
thirty
when
he
emerged
from
the
Jaguar
limousine
onto
Inner
Temple
Lane
with
Sophie
and
Teabing.
The
threesome
wound
through
a
maze
of
buildings
to
a
small
courtyard
outside
the
Temple
Church.
The
rough
hewn
stone
shimmered
in
the
rain,
and
doves
cooed
in
the
architecture
overhead.
London's
ancient
Temple
Church
was
constructed
entirely
of
Caen
stone.
A
dramatic,
circular
edifice
with
a
daunting
facade,
a
central
turret,
and
a
protruding
nave
off
one
side,
the
church
looked
more
like
a
military
stronghold
than
a
place
of
worship.
Consecrated
on
the
tenth
of
February
in
1
185
by
Heraclius,
Patriarch
of
Jerusalem,
the
Temple
Church
survived
eight
centuries
of
political
turmoil,
the
Great
Fire
of
London,
and
the
First
World
War,
only
to
be
heavily
damaged
by
Luftwaffe
incendiary
bombs
in
1940.
After
the
war,
it
was
restored
to
its
original,
stark
grandeur.
The
simplicity
of
the
circle,
Langdon
thought,
admiring
the
building
for
the
first
time.
The
architecture
was
coarse
and
simple,
more
reminiscent
of
Rome's
rugged
Castel
Sant'Angelo
than
the
refined
Pantheon.
The
boxy
annex
jutting
out
to
the
right
was
an
unfortunate
eyesore,
although
it
did
little
to
shroud
the
original
pagan
shape
of
the
primary
structure.
"It's
early
on
a
Saturday,"
Teabing
said,
hobbling
toward
the
entrance,
"so
I'm
assuming
we
won't
have
services
to
deal
with."
The
church's
entryway
was
a
recessed
stone
niche
inside
which
stood
a
large
wooden
door.
To
the
left
of
the
door,
looking
entirely
out
of
place,
hung
a
bulletin
board
covered
with
concert
schedules
and
religious
service
announcements.
Teabing
frowned
as
he
read
the
board.
"They
don't
open
to
sightseers
for
another
couple
of
hours."
He
moved
to
the
door
and
tried
it.
The
door
didn't
budge.
Putting
his
ear
to
the
wood,
he
listened.
After
a
moment,
he
pulled
back,
a
scheming
look
on
his
face
as
he
pointed
to
the
bulletin
board.
"Robert,
check
the
service
schedule,
will
you?
Who
is
presiding
this
week?"
Inside
the
church,
an
altar
boy
was
almost
finished
vacuuming
the
communion
kneelers
when
he
heard
a
knocking
on
the
sanctuary
door.
He
ignored
it.
Father
Harvey
Knowles
had
his
own
keys
and
was
not
due
for
another
couple
of
hours.
The
knocking
was
probably
a
curious
tourist
or
indigent.
The
altar
boy
kept
vacuuming,
but
the
knocking
continued.
Can't
you
read?
The
sign
on
the
door
clearly
stated
that
the
church
did
not
open
until
nine
thirty
on
Saturday.
The
altar
boy
remained
with
his
chores.
Suddenly,
the
knocking
turned
to
a
forceful
banging,
as
if
someone
were
hitting
the
door
with
a
metal
rod.
The
young
man
switched
off
his
vacuum
cleaner
and
marched
angrily
toward
the
door.
Unlatching
it
from
within,
he
swung
it
open.
Three
people
stood
in
the
entryway.
Tourists,
he
grumbled.
"We
open
at
nine
thirty."
The
heavyset
man,
apparently
the
leader,
stepped
forward
using
metal
crutches.
"I
am
Sir
Leigh
Teabing,"
he
said,
his
accent
a
highbrow,
Saxonesque
British.
"As
you
are
no
doubt
aware,
I
am
escorting
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Christopher
Wren
the
Fourth."
He
stepped
aside,
flourishing
his
arm
toward
the
attractive
couple
behind
them.
The
woman
was
soft
featured,
with
lush
burgundy
hair.
The
man
was
tall,
dark
haired,
and
looked
vaguely
familiar.
The
altar
boy
had
no
idea
how
to
respond.
Sir
Christopher
Wren
was
the
Temple
Church's
most
famous
benefactor.
He
had
made
possible
all
the
restorations
following
damage
caused
by
the
Great
Fire.
He
had
also
been
dead
since
the
early
eighteenth
century.
"Urn
an
honor
to
meet
you?"
The
man
on
crutches
frowned.
"Good
thing
you're
not
in
sales,
young
man,
you're
not
very
convincing.
Where
is
Father
Knowles?"
"It's
Saturday.
He's
not
due
in
until
later."
The
crippled
man's
scowl
deepened.
"There's
gratitude.
He
assured
us
he
would
be
here,
but
it
looks
like
we'll
do
it
without
him.
It
won't
take
long."
The
altar
boy
remained
blocking
the
doorway.
"I'm
sorry,
what
won't
take
long?"
The
visitor's
eyes
sharpened
now,
and
he
leaned
forward
whispering
as
if
to
save
everyone
some
embarrassment.
"Young
man,
apparently
you
are
new
here.
Every
year
Sir
Christopher
Wren's
descendants
bring
a
pinch
of
the
old
man's
ashes
to
scatter
in
the
Temple
sanctuary.
It
is
part
of
his
last
will
and
testament.
Nobody
is
particularly
happy
about
making
the
trip,
but
what
can
we
do?"
The
altar
boy
had
been
here
a
couple
of
years
but
had
never
heard
of
this
custom.
"It
would
be
better
if
you
waited
until
nine
thirty.
The
church
isn't
open
yet,
and
I'm
not
finished
hoovering."
The
man
on
crutches
glared
angrily.
"Young
man,
the
only
reason
there's
anything
left
of
this
building
for
you
to
hoover
is
on
account
of
the
gentleman
in
that
woman's
pocket."
"I'm
sorry?"
"Mrs.
Wren,"
the
man
on
crutches
said,
"would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
show
this
impertinent
young
man
the
reliquary
of
ashes?"
The
woman
hesitated
a
moment
and
then,
as
if
awaking
from
a
trance,
reached
in
her
sweater
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
small
cylinder
wrapped
in
protective
fabric.
"There,
you
see?"
the
man
on
crutches
snapped.
"Now,
you
can
either
grant
his
dying
wish
and
let
us
sprinkle
his
ashes
in
the
sanctuary,
or
I
tell
Father
Knowles
how
we've
been
treated."
The
altar
boy
hesitated,
well
acquainted
with
Father
Knowles'
deep
observance
of
church
tradition
and,
more
importantly,
with
his
foul
temper
when
anything
cast
this
time
honored
shrine
in
anything
but
favorable
light.
Maybe
Father
Knowles
had
simply
forgotten
these
family
members
were
coming.
If
so,
then
there
was
far
more
risk
in
turning
them
away
than
in
letting
them
in.
After
all,
they
said
it
would
only
take
a
minute.
What
harm
could
it
do
?
When
the
altar
boy
stepped
aside
to
let
the
three
people
pass,
he
could
have
sworn
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Wren
looked
just
as
bewildered
by
all
of
this
as
he
was.
Uncertain,
the
boy
returned
to
his
chores,
watching
them
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye.
Langdon
had
to
smile
as
the
threesome
moved
deeper
into
the
church.
"Leigh,"
he
whispered,
"you
lie
entirely
too
well."
Teabing's
eyes
twinkled.
"Oxford
Theatre
Club.
They
still
talk
of
my
Julius
Caesar.
I'm
certain
nobody
has
ever
performed
the
first
scene
of
Act
Three
with
more
dedication."
Langdon
glanced
over.
"I
thought
Caesar
was
dead
in
that
scene."
Teabing
smirked.
"Yes,
but
my
toga
tore
open
when
I
fell,
and
I
had
to
lie
on
stage
for
half
an
hour
with
my
todger
hanging
out.
Even
so,
I
never
moved
a
muscle.
I
was
brilliant,
I
tell
you."
Langdon
cringed.
Sorry
I
missed
it.
As
the
group
moved
through
the
rectangular
annex
toward
the
archway
leading
into
the
main
church,
Langdon
was
surprised
by
the
barren
austerity.
Although
the
altar
layout
resembled
that
of
a
linear
Christian
chapel,
the
furnishings
were
stark
and
cold,
bearing
none
of
the
traditional
ornamentation.
"Bleak,"
he
whispered.
Teabing
chuckled.
"Church
of
England.
Anglicans
drink
their
religion
straight.
Nothing
to
distract
from
their
misery."
Sophie
motioned
through
the
vast
opening
that
gave
way
to
the
circular
section
of
the
church.
"It
looks
like
a
fortress
in
there,"
she
whispered.
Langdon
agreed.
Even
from
here,
the
walls
looked
unusually
robust.
"The
Knights
Templar
were
warriors,"
Teabing
reminded,
the
sound
of
his
aluminum
crutches
echoing
in
this
reverberant
space.
"A
religio
military
society.
Their
churches
were
their
strongholds
and
their
banks."
"Banks?"
Sophie
asked,
glancing
at
Leigh.
"Heavens,
yes.
The
Templars
invented
the
concept
of
modern
banking.
For
European
nobility,
traveling
with
gold
was
perilous,
so
the
Templars
allowed
nobles
to
deposit
gold
in
their
nearest
Temple
Church
and
then
draw
it
from
any
other
Temple
Church
across
Europe.
All
they
needed
was
proper
documentation."
He
winked.
"And
a
small
commission.
They
were
the
original
ATMs."
Teabing
pointed
toward
a
stained
glass
window
where
the
breaking
sun
was
refracting
through
a
white
clad
knight
riding
a
rose
colored
horse.
"Alanus
Marcel,"
Teabing
said,
"Master
of
the
Temple
in
the
early
twelve
hundreds.
He
and
his
successors
actually
held
the
Parliamentary
chair
of
Primus
Baro
Angiae."
Langdon
was
surprised.
"First
Baron
of
the
Realm?"
Teabing
nodded.
"The
Master
of
the
Temple,
some
claim,
held
more
influence
than
the
king
himself.
"
As
they
arrived
outside
the
circular
chamber,
Teabing
shot
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
altar
boy,
who
was
vacuuming
in
the
distance.
"You
know,"
Teabing
whispered
to
Sophie,
"the
Holy
Grail
is
said
to
once
have
been
stored
in
this
church
overnight
while
the
Templars
moved
it
from
one
hiding
place
to
another.
Can
you
imagine
the
four
chests
of
Sangreal
documents
sitting
right
here
with
Mary
Magdalene's
sarcophagus?
It
gives
me
gooseflesh."
Langdon
was
feeling
gooseflesh
too
as
they
stepped
into
the
circular
chamber.
His
eye
traced
the
curvature
of
the
chamber's
pale
stone
perimeter,
taking
in
the
carvings
of
gargoyles,
demons,
monsters,
and
pained
human
faces,
all
staring
inward.
Beneath
the
carvings,
a
single
stone
pew
curled
around
the
entire
circumference
of
the
room.
"Theater
in
the
round,"
Langdon
whispered.
Teabing
raised
a
crutch,
pointing
toward
the
far
left
of
the
room
and
then
to
the
far
right.
Langdon
had
already
seen
them.
Ten
stone
knights.
Five
on
the
left.
Five
on
the
right.
Lying
prone
on
the
floor,
the
carved,
life
sized
figures
rested
in
peaceful
poses.
The
knights
were
depicted
wearing
full
armor,
shields,
and
swords,
and
the
tombs
gave
Langdon
the
uneasy
sensation
that
someone
had
snuck
in
and
poured
plaster
over
the
knights
while
they
were
sleeping.
All
of
the
figures
were
deeply
weathered,
and
yet
each
was
clearly
unique
different
armory
pieces,
distinct
leg
and
arm
positions,
facial
features,
and
markings
on
their
shields.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
Langdon
felt
shaky
as
he
inched
deeper
into
the
circular
room.
This
had
to
be
the
place.
In
a
rubbish
strewn
alley
very
close
to
Temple
Church,
Remy
Legaludec
pulled
the
Jaguar
limousine
to
a
stop
behind
a
row
of
industrial
waste
bins.
Killing
the
engine,
he
checked
the
area.
Deserted.
He
got
out
of
the
car,
walked
toward
the
rear,
and
climbed
back
into
the
limousine's
main
cabin
where
the
monk
was.
Sensing
Remy's
presence,
the
monk
in
the
back
emerged
from
a
prayer
like
trance,
his
red
eyes
looking
more
curious
than
fearful.
All
evening
Remy
had
been
impressed
with
this
trussed
man's
ability
to
stay
calm.
After
some
initial
struggles
in
the
Range
Rover,
the
monk
seemed
to
have
accepted
his
plight
and
given
over
his
fate
to
a
higher
power.
Loosening
his
bow
tie,
Remy
unbuttoned
his
high,
starched,
wing
tipped
collar
and
felt
as
if
he
could
breathe
for
the
first
time
in
years.
He
went
to
the
limousine's
wet
bar,
where
he
poured
himself
a
Smirnoff
vodka.
He
drank
it
in
a
single
swallow
and
followed
it
with
a
second.
Soon
I
will
be
a
man
of
leisure.
Searching
the
bar,
Remy
found
a
standard
service
wine
opener
and
flicked
open
the
sharp
blade.
The
knife
was
usually
employed
to
slice
the
lead
foil
from
corks
on
fine
bottles
of
wine,
but
it
would
serve
a
far
more
dramatic
purpose
this
morning.
Remy
turned
and
faced
Silas,
holding
up
the
glimmering
blade.
Now
those
red
eyes
flashed
fear.
Remy
smiled
and
moved
toward
the
back
of
the
limousine.
The
monk
recoiled,
struggling
against
his
bonds.
"Be
still,"
Remy
whispered,
raising
the
blade.
Silas
could
not
believe
that
God
had
forsaken
him.
Even
the
physical
pain
of
being
bound
Silas
had
turned
into
a
spiritual
exercise,
asking
the
throb
of
his
blood
starved
muscles
to
remind
him
of
the
pain
Christ
endured.
have
been
praying
all
night
for
liberation.
Now,
as
the
knife
descended,
Silas
clenched
his
eyes
shut.
A
slash
of
pain
tore
through
his
shoulder
blades.
He
cried
out,
unable
to
believe
he
was
going
to
die
here
in
the
back
of
this
limousine,
unable
to
defend
himself.
was
doing
God's
work.
The
Teacher
said
he
would
protect
me.
Silas
felt
the
biting
warmth
spreading
across
his
back
and
shoulders
and
could
picture
his
own
blood,
spilling
out
over
his
flesh.
A
piercing
pain
cut
through
his
thighs
now,
and
he
felt
the
onset
of
that
familiar
undertow
of
disorientation
the
body's
defense
mechanism
against
the
pain.
As
the
biting
heat
tore
through
all
of
his
muscles
now,
Silas
clenched
his
eyes
tighter,
determined
that
the
final
image
of
his
life
would
not
be
of
his
own
killer.
Instead
he
pictured
a
younger
Bishop
Aringarosa,
standing
before
the
small
church
in
Spain
the
church
that
he
and
Silas
had
built
with
their
own
hands.
The
beginning
of
my
life.
Silas
felt
as
if
his
body
were
on
fire.
"Take
a
drink,"
the
tuxedoed
man
whispered,
his
accent
French.
"It
will
help
with
your
circulation."
Silas's
eyes
flew
open
in
surprise.
A
blurry
image
was
leaning
over
him,
offering
a
glass
of
liquid.
A
mound
of
shredded
duct
tape
lay
on
the
floor
beside
the
bloodless
knife.
"Drink
this,"
he
repeated.
"The
pain
you
feel
is
the
blood
rushing
into
your
muscles."
Silas
felt
the
fiery
throb
transforming
now
to
a
prickling
sting.
The
vodka
tasted
terrible,
but
he
drank
it,
feeling
grateful.
Fate
had
dealt
Silas
a
healthy
share
of
bad
luck
tonight,
but
God
had
solved
it
all
with
one
miraculous
twist.
God
has
not
forsaken
me.
Silas
knew
what
Bishop
Aringarosa
would
call
it.
Divine
intervention.
"I
had
wanted
to
free
you
earlier,"
the
servant
apologized,
"but
it
was
impossible.
With
the
police
arriving
at
Chateau
Villette,
and
then
at
Biggin
Hill
airport,
this
was
the
first
possible
moment.
You
understand,
don't
you,
Silas?"
Silas
recoiled,
startled.
"You
know
my
name?"
The
servant
smiled.
Silas
sat
up
now,
rubbing
his
stiff
muscles,
his
emotions
a
torrent
of
incredulity,
appreciation,
and
confusion.
"Are
you
the
Teacher?"
Remy
shook
his
head,
laughing
at
the
proposition.
"I
wish
I
had
that
kind
of
power.
No,
I
am
not
the
Teacher.
Like
you,
I
serve
him.
But
the
Teacher
speaks
highly
of
you.
My
name
is
Remy."
Silas
was
amazed.
"I
don't
understand.
If
you
work
for
the
Teacher,
why
did
Langdon
bring
the
keystone
to
your
home?"
"Not
my
home.
The
home
of
the
world's
foremost
Grail
historian,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing."
"But
you
live
there.
The
odds"
Remy
smiled,
seeming
to
have
no
trouble
with
the
apparent
coincidence
of
Langdon's
chosen
refuge.
"It
was
all
utterly
predictable.
Robert
Langdon
was
in
possession
of
the
keystone,
and
he
needed
help.
What
more
logical
place
to
run
than
to
the
home
of
Leigh
Teabing?
That
I
happen
to
live
there
is
why
the
Teacher
approached
me
in
the
first
place."
He
paused.
"How
do
you
think
the
Teacher
knows
so
much
about
the
Grail?"
Now
it
dawned,
and
Silas
was
stunned.
The
Teacher
had
recruited
a
servant
who
had
access
to
all
of
Sir
Leigh
Teabing's
research.
It
was
brilliant.
"There
is
much
I
have
to
tell
you,"
Remy
said,
handing
Silas
the
loaded
Heckler
Koch
pistol.
Then
he
reached
through
the
open
partition
and
retrieved
a
small,
palm
sized
revolver
from
the
glove
box.
"But
first,
you
and
I
have
a
job
to
do."
Captain
Fache
descended
from
his
transport
plane
at
Biggin
Hill
and
listened
in
disbelief
to
the
Kent
chief
inspector's
account
of
what
had
happened
in
Teabing's
hangar.
"I
searched
the
plane
myself,"
the
inspector
insisted,
"and
there
was
no
one
inside."
His
tone
turned
haughty.
"And
I
should
add
that
if
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
presses
charges
against
me,
I
will
"Did
you
interrogate
the
pilot?"
"Of
course
not.
He
is
French,
and
our
jurisdiction
requires
"Take
me
to
the
plane."
Arriving
at
the
hangar,
Fache
needed
only
sixty
seconds
to
locate
an
anomalous
smear
of
blood
on
the
pavement
near
where
the
limousine
had
been
parked.
Fache
walked
up
to
the
plane
and
rapped
loudly
on
the
fuselage.
"This
is
the
captain
of
the
French
Judicial
Police.
Open
the
door!"
The
terrified
pilot
opened
the
hatch
and
lowered
the
stairs.
Fache
ascended.
Three
minutes
later,
with
the
help
of
his
sidearm,
he
had
a
full
confession,
including
a
description
of
the
bound
albino
monk.
In
addition,
he
learned
that
the
pilot
saw
Langdon
and
Sophie
leave
something
behind
in
Teabing's
safe,
a
wooden
box
of
some
sort.
Although
the
pilot
denied
knowing
what
was
in
the
box,
he
admitted
it
had
been
the
focus
of
Langdon's
full
attention
during
the
flight
to
London.
"Open
the
safe,"
Fache
demanded.
The
pilot
looked
terrified.
"I
don't
know
the
combination!"
"That's
too
bad.
I
was
going
to
offer
to
let
you
keep
your
pilot's
license."
The
pilot
wrung
his
hands.
"I
know
some
men
in
maintenance
here.
Maybe
they
could
drill
it?"
"You
have
half
an
hour."
The
pilot
leapt
for
his
radio.
Fache
strode
to
the
back
of
the
plane
and
poured
himself
a
hard
drink.
It
was
early,
but
he
had
not
yet
slept,
so
this
hardly
counted
as
drinking
before
noon.
Sitting
in
a
plush
bucket
seat,
he
closed
his
eyes,
trying
to
sort
out
what
was
going
on.
The
Kent
police's
blunder
could
cost
me
dearly.
Everyone
was
now
on
the
lookout
for
a
black
Jaguar
limousine.
Fache's
phone
rang,
and
he
wished
for
a
moment's
peace.
"Alio?"
"I'm
en
route
to
London."
It
was
Bishop
Aringarosa.
"I'll
be
arriving
in
an
hour."
Fache
sat
up.
"I
thought
you
were
going
to
Paris."
"I
am
deeply
concerned.
I
have
changed
my
plans."
"You
should
not
have."
"Do
you
have
Silas?"
"No.
His
captors
eluded
the
local
police
before
I
landed."
Aringarosa's
anger
rang
sharply.
"You
assured
me
you
would
stop
that
plane!"
Fache
lowered
his
voice.
"Bishop,
considering
your
situation,
I
recommend
you
not
test
my
patience
today.
I
will
find
Silas
and
the
others
as
soon
as
possible.
Where
are
you
landing?"
"One
moment."
Aringarosa
covered
the
receiver
and
then
came
back.
"The
pilot
is
trying
to
get
clearance
at
Heathrow.
I'm
his
only
passenger,
but
our
redirect
was
unscheduled."
"Tell
him
to
come
to
Biggin
Hill
Executive
Airport
in
Kent.
I'll
get
him
clearance.
If
I'm
not
here
when
you
land,
I'll
have
a
car
waiting
for
you.
"Thank
you."
"As
I
expressed
when
we
first
spoke,
Bishop,
you
would
do
well
to
remember
that
you
are
not
the
only
man
on
the
verge
of
losing
everything."
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
Each
of
the
carved
knights
within
the
Temple
Church
lay
on
his
back
with
his
head
resting
on
a
rectangular
stone
pillow.
Sophie
felt
a
chill.
The
poem's
reference
to
an
"orb"
conjured
images
of
the
night
in
her
grandfather's
basement.
Hieros
Gamos.
The
orbs.
Sophie
wondered
if
the
ritual
had
been
performed
in
this
very
sanctuary.
The
circular
room
seemed
custom
built
for
such
a
pagan
rite.
A
stone
pew
encircled
a
bare
expanse
of
floor
in
the
middle.
A
theater
in
the
round,
as
Robert
had
called
it.
She
imagined
this
chamber
at
night,
filled
with
masked
people,
chanting
by
torchlight,
all
witnessing
a
"sacred
communion"
in
the
center
of
the
room.
Forcing
the
image
from
her
mind,
she
advanced
with
Langdon
and
Teabing
toward
the
first
group
of
knights.
Despite
Teabing's
insistence
that
their
investigation
should
be
conducted
meticulously,
Sophie
felt
eager
and
pushed
ahead
of
them,
making
a
cursory
walk
through
of
the
five
knights
on
the
left.
Scrutinizing
these
first
tombs,
Sophie
noted
the
similarities
and
differences
between
them.
Every
knight
was
on
his
back,
but
three
of
the
knights
had
their
legs
extended
straight
out
while
two
had
their
legs
crossed.
The
oddity
seemed
to
have
no
relevance
to
the
missing
orb.
Examining
their
clothing,
Sophie
noted
that
two
of
the
knights
wore
tunics
over
their
armor,
while
the
other
three
wore
ankle
length
robes.
Again,
utterly
unhelpful.
Sophie
turned
her
attention
to
the
only
other
obvious
difference
their
hand
positions.
Two
knights
clutched
swords,
two
prayed,
and
one
had
his
arms
at
his
side.
After
a
long
moment
looking
at
the
hands,
Sophie
shrugged,
having
seen
no
hint
anywhere
of
a
conspicuously
absent
orb.
Feeling
the
weight
of
the
cryptex
in
her
sweater
pocket,
she
glanced
back
at
Langdon
and
Teabing.
The
men
were
moving
slowly,
still
only
at
the
third
knight,
apparently
having
no
luck
either.
In
no
mood
to
wait,
she
turned
away
from
them
toward
the
second
group
of
knights.
As
she
crossed
the
open
space,
she
quietly
recited
the
poem
she
had
read
so
many
times
now
that
it
was
committed
to
memory.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
His
labor's
fruit
a
Holy
wrath
incurred.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
When
Sophie
arrived
at
the
second
group
of
knights,
she
found
that
this
second
group
was
similar
to
the
first.
All
lay
with
varied
body
positions,
wearing
armor
and
swords.
That
was,
all
except
the
tenth
and
final
tomb.
Hurrying
over
to
it,
she
stared
down.
No
pillow.
No
armor.
No
tunic.
No
sword.
"Robert?
Leigh?"
she
called,
her
voice
echoing
around
the
chamber.
"There's
something
missing
over
here."
Both
men
looked
up
and
immediately
began
to
cross
the
room
toward
her.
"An
orb?"
Teabing
called
excitedly.
His
crutches
clicked
out
a
rapid
staccato
as
he
hurried
across
the
room.
"Are
we
missing
an
orb?"
"Not
exactly,"
Sophie
said,
frowning
at
the
tenth
tomb.
"We
seem
to
be
missing
an
entire
knight."
Arriving
beside
her
both
men
gazed
down
in
confusion
at
the
tenth
tomb.
Rather
than
a
knight
lying
in
the
open
air,
this
tomb
was
a
sealed
stone
casket.
The
casket
was
trapezoidal,
tapered
at
the
feet,
widening
toward
the
top,
with
a
peaked
lid.
"Why
isn't
this
knight
shown?"
Langdon
asked.
"Fascinating,"
Teabing
said,
stroking
his
chin.
"I
had
forgotten
about
this
oddity.
It's
been
years
since
I
was
here."
"This
coffin,"
Sophie
said,
"looks
like
it
was
carved
at
the
same
time
and
by
the
same
sculptor
as
the
other
nine
tombs.
So
why
is
this
knight
in
a
casket
rather
than
in
the
open?"
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"One
of
this
church's
mysteries.
To
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
nobody
has
ever
found
any
explanation
for
it.
"Hello?"
the
altar
boy
said,
arriving
with
a
perturbed
look
on
his
face.
"Forgive
me
if
this
seems
rude,
but
you
told
me
you
wanted
to
spread
ashes,
and
yet
you
seem
to
be
sightseeing."
Teabing
scowled
at
the
boy
and
turned
to
Langdon.
"Mr.
Wren,
apparently
your
family's
philanthropy
does
not
buy
you
the
time
it
used
to,
so
perhaps
we
should
take
out
the
ashes
and
get
on
with
it."
Teabing
turned
to
Sophie.
"Mrs.
Wren?"
Sophie
played
along,
pulling
the
vellumwrapped
cryptex
from
her
pocket.
"Now
then,"
Teabing
snapped
at
the
boy,
"if
you
would
give
us
some
privacy?"
The
altar
boy
did
not
move.
He
was
eyeing
Langdon
closely
now.
"You
look
familiar."
Teabing
huffed.
"Perhaps
that
is
because
Mr.
Wren
comes
here
every
year!"
Or
perhaps,
Sophie
now
feared,
because
he
saw
Langdon
on
television
at
the
Vatican
last
year.
"I
have
never
met
Mr.
Wren,"
the
altar
boy
declared.
"You're
mistaken,"
Langdon
said
politely.
"I
believe
you
and
I
met
in
passing
last
year.
Father
Knowles
failed
to
formally
introduce
us,
but
I
recognized
your
face
as
we
came
in.
Now,
I
realize
this
is
an
intrusion,
but
if
you
could
afford
me
a
few
more
minutes,
I
have
traveled
a
great
distance
to
scatter
ashes
amongst
these
tombs."
Langdon
spoke
his
lines
with
Teabing
esque
belie
vability.
The
altar
boy's
expression
turned
even
more
skeptical.
"These
are
not
tombs.
"I'm
sorry?"
Langdon
said.
"Of
course
they
are
tombs,"
Teabing
declared.
"What
are
you
talking
about?"
The
altar
boy
shook
his
head.
"Tombs
contain
bodies.
These
are
effigies.
Stone
tributes
to
real
men.
There
are
no
bodies
beneath
these
figures."
"This
is
a
crypt!"
Teabing
said.
"Only
in
outdated
history
books.
This
was
believed
to
be
a
crypt
but
was
revealed
as
nothing
of
the
sort
during
the
1950
renovation."
He
turned
back
to
Langdon.
"And
I
imagine
Mr.
Wren
would
know
that.
Considering
it
was
his
family
that
uncovered
that
fact.
An
uneasy
silence
fell.
It
was
broken
by
the
sound
of
a
door
slamming
out
in
the
annex.
"That
must
be
Father
Knowles,"
Teabing
said.
"Perhaps
you
should
go
see?"
The
altar
boy
looked
doubtful
but
stalked
back
toward
the
annex,
leaving
Langdon,
Sophie,
and
Teabing
to
eye
one
another
gloomily.
"Leigh,"
Langdon
whispered.
"No
bodies?
What
is
he
talking
about?"
Teabing
looked
distraught.
"I
don't
know.
I
always
thought
certainly,
this
must
be
the
place.
I
can't
imagine
he
knows
what
he
is
talking
about.
It
makes
no
sense
!
"Can
I
see
the
poem
again?"
Langdon
said.
Sophie
pulled
the
cryptex
from
her
pocket
and
carefully
handed
it
to
him.
Langdon
unwrapped
the
vellum,
holding
the
cryptex
in
his
hand
while
he
examined
the
poem.
"Yes,
the
poem
definitely
references
a
tomb.
Not
an
effigy."
"Could
the
poem
be
wrong?"
Teabing
asked.
"Could
Jacques
Sauniere
have
made
the
same
mistake
I
just
did?"
Langdon
considered
it
and
shook
his
head.
"Leigh,
you
said
it
yourself.
This
church
was
built
by
Templars,
the
military
arm
of
the
Priory.
Something
tells
me
the
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
would
have
a
pretty
good
idea
if
there
were
knights
buried
here."
Teabing
looked
flabbergasted.
"But
this
place
is
perfect."
He
wheeled
back
toward
the
knights.
"We
must
be
missing
something!"
Entering
the
annex,
the
altar
boy
was
surprised
to
find
it
deserted.
"Father
Knowles?"
know
I
heard
the
door,
he
thought,
moving
forward
until
he
could
see
the
entryway.
A
thin
man
in
a
tuxedo
stood
near
the
doorway,
scratching
his
head
and
looking
lost.
The
altar
boy
gave
an
irritated
huff,
realizing
he
had
forgotten
to
relock
the
door
when
he
let
the
others
in.
Now
some
pathetic
sod
had
wandered
in
off
the
street,
looking
for
directions
to
some
wedding
from
the
looks
of
it.
"I'm
sorry,"
he
called
out,
passing
a
large
pillar,
"we're
closed."
A
flurry
of
cloth
ruffled
behind
him,
and
before
the
altar
boy
could
turn,
his
head
snapped
backward,
a
powerful
hand
clamping
hard
over
his
mouth
from
behind,
muffling
his
scream.
The
hand
over
the
boy's
mouth
was
snow
white,
and
he
smelled
alcohol.
The
prim
man
in
the
tuxedo
calmly
produced
a
very
small
revolver,
which
he
aimed
directly
at
the
boy's
forehead.
The
altar
boy
felt
his
groin
grow
hot
and
realized
he
had
wet
himself.
"Listen
carefully,"
the
tuxedoed
man
whispered.
"You
will
exit
this
church
silently,
and
you
will
run.
You
will
not
stop.
Is
that
clear?"
The
boy
nodded
as
best
he
could
with
the
hand
over
his
mouth.
"If
you
call
the
police"
The
tuxedoed
man
pressed
the
gun
to
his
skin.
"I
will
find
you."
The
next
thing
the
boy
knew,
he
was
sprinting
across
the
outside
courtyard
with
no
plans
of
stopping
until
his
legs
gave
out.
Like
a
ghost,
Silas
drifted
silently
behind
his
target.
Sophie
Neveu
sensed
him
too
late.
Before
she
could
turn,
Silas
pressed
the
gun
barrel
into
her
spine
and
wrapped
a
powerful
arm
across
her
chest,
pulling
her
back
against
his
hulking
body.
She
yelled
in
surprise.
Teabing
and
Langdon
both
turned
now,
their
expressions
astonished
and
fearful.
"What?"
Teabing
choked
out.
"What
did
you
do
to
Remy!"
"Your
only
concern,"
Silas
said
calmly,
"is
that
I
leave
here
with
the
keystone."
This
recovery
mission,
as
Remy
had
described
it,
was
to
be
clean
and
simple:
Enter
the
church,
take
the
keystone,
and
walk
out;
no
killing,
no
struggle.
Holding
Sophie
firm,
Silas
dropped
his
hand
from
her
chest,
down
to
her
waist,
slipping
it
inside
her
deep
sweater
pockets,
searching.
He
could
smell
the
soft
fragrance
of
her
hair
through
his
own
alcohol
laced
breath.
"Where
is
it?"
he
whispered.
The
keystone
was
in
her
sweater
pocket
earlier.
So
where
is
it
now?
"It's
over
here,"
Langdon's
deep
voice
resonated
from
across
the
room.
Silas
turned
to
see
Langdon
holding
the
black
cryptex
before
him,
waving
it
back
and
forth
like
a
matador
tempting
a
dumb
animal.
"Set
it
down,"
Silas
demanded.
"Let
Sophie
and
Leigh
leave
the
church,"
Langdon
replied.
"You
and
I
can
settle
this."
Silas
pushed
Sophie
away
from
him
and
aimed
the
gun
at
Langdon,
moving
toward
him.
"Not
a
step
closer,"
Langdon
said.
"Not
until
they
leave
the
building."
"You
are
in
no
position
to
make
demands."
"I
disagree."
Langdon
raised
the
cryptex
high
over
his
head.
"I
will
not
hesitate
to
smash
this
on
the
floor
and
break
the
vial
inside."
Although
Silas
sneered
outwardly
at
the
threat,
he
felt
a
flash
of
fear.
This
was
unexpected.
He
aimed
the
gun
at
Langdon's
head
and
kept
his
voice
as
steady
as
his
hand.
"You
would
never
break
the
keystone.
You
want
to
find
the
Grail
as
much
as
I
do."
You're
wrong.
You
want
it
much
more.
You've
proven
you're
willing
to
kill
for
it."
Forty
feet
away,
peering
out
from
the
annex
pews
near
the
archway,
Remy
Legaludec
felt
a
rising
alarm.
The
maneuver
had
not
gone
as
planned,
and
even
from
here,
he
could
see
Silas
was
uncertain
how
to
handle
the
situation.
At
the
Teacher's
orders,
Remy
had
forbidden
Silas
to
fire
his
gun.
"Let
them
go,"
Langdon
again
demanded,
holding
the
cryptex
high
over
his
head
and
staring
into
Silas's
gun.
The
monk's
red
eyes
filled
with
anger
and
frustration,
and
Remy
tightened
with
fear
that
Silas
might
actually
shoot
Langdon
while
he
was
holding
the
cryptex.
The
cryptex
cannot
fall!
The
cryptex
was
to
be
Remy's
ticket
to
freedom
and
wealth.
A
little
over
a
year
ago,
he
was
simply
a
fifty
five
year
old
manservant
living
within
the
walls
of
Chateau
Villette,
catering
to
the
whims
of
the
insufferable
cripple
Sir
Leigh
Teabing.
Then
he
was
approached
with
an
extraordinary
proposition.
Remy's
association
with
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
the
preeminent
Grail
historian
on
earth
was
going
to
bring
Remy
everything
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
in
life.
Since
then,
every
moment
he
had
spent
inside
Chateau
Villette
had
been
leading
him
to
this
very
instant.
am
so
close,
Remy
told
himself,
gazing
into
the
sanctuary
of
the
Temple
Church
and
the
keystone
in
Robert
Langdon's
hand.
If
Langdon
dropped
it,
all
would
be
lost.
Am
I
willing
to
show
my
face?
It
was
something
the
Teacher
had
strictly
forbidden.
Remy
was
the
only
one
who
knew
the
Teacher's
identity.
"Are
you
certain
you
want
Silas
to
carry
out
this
task?"
Remy
had
asked
the
Teacher
less
than
half
an
hour
ago,
upon
getting
orders
to
steal
the
keystone.
"I
myself
am
capable."
The
Teacher
was
resolute.
"Silas
served
us
well
with
the
four
Priory
members.
He
will
recover
the
keystone.
You
must
remain
anonymous.
If
others
see
you,
they
will
need
to
be
eliminated,
and
there
has
been
enough
killing
already.
Do
not
reveal
your
face."
My
face
will
change,
Remy
thought.
With
what
you've
promised
to
pay
me,
I
will
become
an
entirely
new
man.
Surgery
could
even
change
his
fingerprints,
the
Teacher
had
told
him.
Soon
he
would
be
free
another
unrecognizable,
beautiful
face
soaking
up
the
sun
on
the
beach.
"Understood,"
Remy
said.
"I
will
assist
Silas
from
the
shadows."
"For
your
own
knowledge,
Remy,"
the
Teacher
had
told
him,
"the
tomb
in
question
is
not
in
the
Temple
Church.
So
have
no
fear.
They
are
looking
in
the
wrong
place."
Remy
was
stunned.
"And
you
know
where
the
tomb
is?"
"Of
course.
Later,
I
will
tell
you.
For
the
moment,
you
must
act
quickly.
If
the
others
figure
out
the
true
location
of
the
tomb
and
leave
the
church
before
you
take
the
cryptex,
we
could
lose
the
Grail
forever."
Remy
didn't
give
a
damn
about
the
Grail,
except
that
the
Teacher
refused
to
pay
him
until
it
was
found.
Remy
felt
giddy
every
time
he
thought
of
the
money
he
soon
would
have.
One
third
of
twenty
million
euro.
Plenty
to
disappear
forever.
Remy
had
pictured
the
beach
towns
on
the
Cote
d'Azur,
where
he
planned
to
live
out
his
days
basking
in
the
sun
and
letting
others
serve
him
for
a
change.
Now,
however,
here
in
the
Temple
Church,
with
Langdon
threatening
to
break
the
keystone,
Remy's
future
was
at
risk.
Unable
to
bear
the
thought
of
coming
this
close
only
to
lose
it
all,
Remy
made
the
decision
to
take
bold
action.
The
gun
in
his
hand
was
a
concealable,
small
caliber,
J
frame
Medusa,
but
it
would
be
plenty
deadly
at
close
range.
Stepping
from
the
shadows,
Remy
marched
into
the
circular
chamber
and
aimed
the
gun
directly
at
Teabing's
head.
"Old
man,
I've
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
do
this."
Sir
Leigh
Teabing's
heart
practically
stalled
to
see
Remy
aiming
a
gun
at
him.
What
is
he
doing!
Teabing
recognized
the
tiny
Medusa
revolver
as
his
own,
the
one
he
kept
locked
in
the
limousine
glove
box
for
safety.
"Remy?"
Teabing
sputtered
in
shock.
"What
is
going
on?"
Langdon
and
Sophie
looked
equally
dumbstruck.
Remy
circled
behind
Teabing
and
rammed
the
pistol
barrel
into
his
back,
high
and
on
the
left,
directly
behind
his
heart.
Teabing
felt
his
muscles
seize
with
terror.
"Remy,
I
don't
"I'll
make
it
simple,"
Remy
snapped,
eyeing
Langdon
over
Teabing's
shoulder.
"Set
down
the
keystone,
or
I
pull
the
trigger."
Langdon
seemed
momentarily
paralyzed.
"The
keystone
is
worthless
to
you,"
he
stammered.
"You
cannot
possibly
open
it."
"Arrogant
fools,"
Remy
sneered.
"Have
you
not
noticed
that
I
have
been
listening
tonight
as
you
discussed
these
poems?
Everything
I
heard,
I
have
shared
with
others.
Others
who
know
more
than
you.
You
are
not
even
looking
in
the
right
place.
The
tomb
you
seek
is
in
another
location
entirely!"
Teabing
felt
panicked.
What
is
he
saying!
"Why
do
you
want
the
Grail?"
Langdon
demanded.
"To
destroy
it?
Before
the
End
of
Days?"
Remy
called
to
the
monk.
"Silas,
take
the
keystone
from
Mr.
Langdon."
As
the
monk
advanced,
Langdon
stepped
back,
raising
the
keystone
high,
looking
fully
prepared
to
hurl
it
at
the
floor.
"I
would
rather
break
it,"
Langdon
said,
"than
see
it
in
the
wrong
hands."
Teabing
now
felt
a
wave
of
horror.
He
could
see
his
life's
work
evaporating
before
his
eyes.
All
his
dreams
about
to
be
shattered.
"Robert,
no!"
Teabing
exclaimed.
"Don't!
That's
the
Grail
you're
holding!
Remy
would
never
shoot
me.
We've
known
each
other
for
ten
Remy
aimed
at
the
ceiling
and
fired
the
Medusa.
The
blast
was
enormous
for
such
a
small
weapon,
the
gunshot
echoing
like
thunder
inside
the
stone
chamber.
Everyone
froze.
"I
am
not
playing
games,"
Remy
said.
"The
next
one
is
in
his
back.
Hand
the
keystone
to
Silas."
Langdon
reluctantly
held
out
the
cryptex.
Silas
stepped
forward
and
took
it,
his
red
eyes
gleaming
with
the
self
satisfaction
of
vengeance.
Slipping
the
keystone
in
the
pocket
of
his
robe,
Silas
backed
off,
still
holding
Langdon
and
Sophie
at
gunpoint.
Teabing
felt
Remy's
arm
clamp
hard
around
his
neck
as
the
servant
began
backing
out
of
the
building,
dragging
Teabing
with
him,
the
gun
still
pressed
in
his
back.
"Let
him
go,"
Langdon
demanded.
"We're
taking
Mr.
Teabing
for
a
drive,"
Remy
said,
still
backing
up.
"If
you
call
the
police,
he
will
die.
If
you
do
anything
to
interfere,
he
will
die.
Is
that
clear?"
"Take
me,"
Langdon
demanded,
his
voice
cracking
with
emotion.
"Let
Leigh
go."
Remy
laughed.
"I
don't
think
so.
He
and
I
have
such
a
nice
history.
Besides,
he
still
might
prove
useful."
Silas
was
backing
up
now,
keeping
Langdon
and
Sophie
at
gunpoint
as
Remy
pulled
Leigh
toward
the
exit,
his
crutches
dragging
behind
him.
Sophie's
voice
was
unwavering.
"Who
are
you
working
for?"
The
question
brought
a
smirk
to
the
departing
Remy's
face.
"You
would
be
surprised,
Mademoiselle
Neveu."
The
fireplace
in
Chateau
Villette's
drawing
room
was
cold,
but
Collet
paced
before
it
nonetheless
as
he
read
the
faxes
from
Interpol.
Not
at
all
what
he
expected.
Andre
Vernet,
according
to
official
records,
was
a
model
citizen.
No
police
record
not
even
a
parking
ticket.
Educated
at
prep
school
and
the
Sorbonne,
he
had
a
cum
laude
degree
in
international
finance.
Interpol
said
Vernet's
name
appeared
in
the
newspapers
from
time
to
time,
but
always
in
a
positive
light.
Apparently
the
man
had
helped
design
the
security
parameters
that
kept
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
a
leader
in
the
ultramodern
world
of
electronic
security.
Vernet's
credit
card
records
showed
a
penchant
for
art
books,
expensive
wine,
and
classical
CD's
mostly
Brahms
which
he
apparently
enjoyed
on
an
exceptionally
high
end
stereo
system
he
had
purchased
several
years
ago.
Zero,
Collet
sighed.
The
only
red
flag
tonight
from
Interpol
had
been
a
set
of
fingerprints
that
apparently
belonged
to
Teabing's
servant.
The
chief
PTS
examiner
was
reading
the
report
in
a
comfortable
chair
across
the
room.
Collet
looked
over.
"Anything?"
The
examiner
shrugged.
"Prints
belong
to
Remy
Legaludec.
Wanted
for
petty
crime.
Nothing
serious.
Looks
like
he
got
kicked
out
of
university
for
rewiring
phone
jacks
to
get
free
service
later
did
some
petty
theft.
Breaking
and
entering.
Skipped
out
on
a
hospital
bill
once
for
an
emergency
tracheotomy."
He
glanced
up,
chuckling.
"Peanut
allergy."
Collet
nodded,
recalling
a
police
investigation
into
a
restaurant
that
had
failed
to
notate
on
its
menu
that
the
chili
recipe
contained
peanut
oil.
An
unsuspecting
patron
had
died
of
anaphylactic
shock
at
the
table
after
a
single
bite.
"Legaludec
is
probably
a
live
in
here
to
avoid
getting
picked
up."
The
examiner
looked
amused.
"His
lucky
night."
Collet
sighed.
"All
right,
you
better
forward
this
info
to
Captain
Fache."
The
examiner
headed
off
just
as
another
PTS
agent
burst
into
the
living
room.
"Lieutenant!
We
found
something
in
the
barn.
From
the
anxious
look
on
the
agent's
face,
Collet
could
only
guess.
"A
body."
"No,
sir.
Something
more"
He
hesitated.
"Unexpected."
Rubbing
his
eyes,
Collet
followed
the
agent
out
to
the
barn.
As
they
entered
the
musty,
cavernous
space,
the
agent
motioned
toward
the
center
of
the
room,
where
a
wooden
ladder
now
ascended
high
into
the
rafters,
propped
against
the
ledge
of
a
hayloft
suspended
high
above
them.
"That
ladder
wasn't
there
earlier,"
Collet
said.
"No,
sir.
I
set
that
up.
We
were
dusting
for
prints
near
the
Rolls
when
I
saw
the
ladder
lying
on
the
floor.
I
wouldn't
have
given
it
a
second
thought
except
the
rungs
were
worn
and
muddy.
This
ladder
gets
regular
use.
The
height
of
the
hayloft
matched
the
ladder,
so
I
raised
it
and
climbed
up
to
have
a
look."
Collet's
eyes
climbed
the
ladder's
steep
incline
to
the
soaring
hayloft.
Someone
goes
up
there
regularly?
From
down
here,
the
loft
appeared
to
be
a
deserted
platform,
and
yet
admittedly
most
of
it
was
invisible
from
this
line
of
sight.
A
senior
PTS
agent
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
ladder,
looking
down.
"You'll
definitely
want
to
see
this,
Lieutenant,"
he
said,
waving
Collet
up
with
a
latex
gloved
hand.
Nodding
tiredly,
Collet
walked
over
to
the
base
of
the
old
ladder
and
grasped
the
bottom
rungs.
The
ladder
was
an
antique
tapered
design
and
narrowed
as
Collet
ascended.
As
he
neared
the
top,
Collet
almost
lost
his
footing
on
a
thin
rung.
The
barn
below
him
spun.
Alert
now,
he
moved
on,
finally
reaching
the
top.
The
agent
above
him
reached
out,
offering
his
wrist.
Collet
grabbed
it
and
made
the
awkward
transition
onto
the
platform.
"It's
over
there,"
the
PTS
agent
said,
pointing
deep
into
the
immaculately
clean
loft.
"Only
one
set
of
prints
up
here.
We'll
have
an
ID
shortly."
Collet
squinted
through
the
dim
light
toward
the
far
wall.
What
the
hell?
Nestled
against
the
far
wall
sat
an
elaborate
computer
workstation
two
tower
CPUs,
a
flat
screen
video
monitor
with
speakers,
an
array
of
hard
drives,
and
a
multichannel
audio
console
that
appeared
to
have
its
own
filtered
power
supply.
Why
in
the
world
would
anyone
work
all
the
way
up
here?
Collet
moved
toward
the
gear.
"Have
you
examined
the
system?"
"It's
a
listening
post."
Collet
spun.
"Surveillance?"
The
agent
nodded.
"Very
advanced
surveillance."
He
motioned
to
a
long
project
table
strewn
with
electronic
parts,
manuals,
tools,
wires,
soldering
irons,
and
other
electronic
components.
"Someone
clearly
knows
what
he's
doing.
A
lot
of
this
gear
is
as
sophisticated
as
our
own
equipment.
Miniature
microphones,
photoelectric
recharging
cells,
high
capacity
RAM
chips.
He's
even
got
some
of
those
new
nano
drives."
Collet
was
impressed.
"Here's
a
complete
system,"
the
agent
said,
handing
Collet
an
assembly
not
much
larger
than
a
pocket
calculator.
Dangling
off
the
contraption
was
a
foot
long
wire
with
a
stamp
sized
piece
of
wafer
thin
foil
stuck
on
the
end.
"The
base
is
a
high
capacity
hard
disk
audio
recording
system
with
rechargeable
battery.
That
strip
of
foil
at
the
end
of
the
wire
is
a
combination
microphone
and
photoelectric
recharging
cell."
Collet
knew
them
well.
These
foil
like,
photocell
microphones
had
been
an
enormous
breakthrough
a
few
years
back.
Now,
a
hard
disk
recorder
could
be
affixed
behind
a
lamp,
for
example,
with
its
foil
microphone
molded
into
the
contour
of
the
base
and
dyed
to
match.
As
long
as
the
microphone
was
positioned
such
that
it
received
a
few
hours
of
sunlight
per
day,
the
photo
cells
would
keep
recharging
the
system.
Bugs
like
this
one
could
listen
indefinitely.
"Reception
method?"
Collet
asked.
The
agent
signaled
to
an
insulated
wire
that
ran
out
of
the
back
of
the
computer,
up
the
wall,
through
a
hole
in
the
barn
roof.
"Simple
radio
wave.
Small
antenna
on
the
roof."
Collet
knew
these
recording
systems
were
generally
placed
in
offices,
were
voice
activated
to
save
hard
disk
space,
and
recorded
snippets
of
conversation
during
the
day,
transmitting
compressed
audio
files
at
night
to
avoid
detection.
After
transmitting,
the
hard
drive
erased
itself
and
prepared
to
do
it
all
over
again
the
next
day.
Collet's
gaze
moved
now
to
a
shelf
on
which
were
stacked
several
hundred
audio
cassettes,
all
labeled
with
dates
and
numbers.
Someone
has
been
very
busy.
He
turned
back
to
the
agent.
"Do
you
have
any
idea
what
target
is
being
bugged?"
"Well,
Lieutenant,"
the
agent
said,
walking
to
the
computer
and
launching
a
piece
of
software.
"It's
the
strangest
thing."
Langdon
felt
utterly
spent
as
he
and
Sophie
hurdled
a
turnstile
at
the
Temple
tube
station
and
dashed
deep
into
the
grimy
labyrinth
of
tunnels
and
platforms.
The
guilt
ripped
through
him.
involved
Leigh,
and
now
he's
in
enormous
danger.
Remy's
involvement
had
been
a
shock,
and
yet
it
made
sense.
Whoever
was
pursuing
the
Grail
had
recruited
someone
on
the
inside.
They
went
to
Teabing'sfor
the
same
reason
I
did.
Throughout
history,
those
who
held
knowledge
of
the
Grail
had
always
been
magnets
for
thieves
and
scholars
alike.
The
fact
that
Teabing
had
been
a
target
all
along
should
have
made
Langdon
feel
less
guilty
about
involving
him.
It
did
not.
We
need
to
find
Leigh
and
help
him.
Immediately.
Langdon
followed
Sophie
to
the
westbound
District
and
Circle
Line
platform,
where
she
hurried
to
a
pay
phone
to
call
the
police,
despite
Remy's
warning
to
the
contrary.
Langdon
sat
on
a
grungy
bench
nearby,
feeling
remorseful.
"The
best
way
to
help
Leigh,"
Sophie
reiterated
as
she
dialed,
"is
to
involve
the
London
authorities
immediately.
Trust
me."
Langdon
had
not
initially
agreed
with
this
idea,
but
as
they
had
hatched
their
plan,
Sophie's
logic
began
to
make
sense.
Teabing
was
safe
at
the
moment.
Even
if
Remy
and
the
others
knew
where
the
knight's
tomb
was
located,
they
still
might
need
Teabing's
help
deciphering
the
orb
reference.
What
worried
Langdon
was
what
would
happen
after
the
Grail
map
had
been
found.
Leigh
will
become
a
huge
liability.
If
Langdon
were
to
have
any
chance
of
helping
Leigh,
or
of
ever
seeing
the
keystone
again,
it
was
essential
that
he
find
the
tomb
first.
Unfortunately,
Remy
has
a
big
head
start.
Slowing
Remy
down
had
become
Sophie's
task.
Finding
the
right
tomb
had
become
Langdon's.
Sophie
would
make
Remy
and
Silas
fugitives
of
the
London
police,
forcing
them
into
hiding
or,
better
yet,
catching
them.
Langdon's
plan
was
less
certain
to
take
the
tube
to
nearby
King's
College,
which
was
renowned
for
its
electronic
theological
database.
The
ultimate
research
tool,
Langdon
had
heard.
Instant
answers
to
any
religious
historical
question.
He
wondered
what
the
database
would
have
to
say
about
"a
knight
a
Pope
interred."
He
stood
up
and
paced,
wishing
the
train
would
hurry.
At
the
pay
phone,
Sophie's
call
finally
connected
to
the
London
police.
"Snow
Hill
Division,"
the
dispatcher
said.
"How
may
I
direct
your
call?"
"I'm
reporting
a
kidnapping."
Sophie
knew
to
be
concise.
"Name
please?"
Sophie
paused.
"Agent
Sophie
Neveu
with
the
French
Judicial
Police."
The
title
had
the
desired
effect.
"Right
away,
ma'am.
Let
me
get
a
detective
on
the
line
for
you."
As
the
call
went
through,
Sophie
began
wondering
if
the
police
would
even
believe
her
description
of
Teabing's
captors.
A
man
in
a
tuxedo.
How
much
easier
to
identify
could
a
suspect
be?
Even
if
Remy
changed
clothes,
he
was
partnered
with
an
albino
monk.
Impossible
to
miss.
Moreover,
they
had
a
hostage
and
could
not
take
public
transportation.
She
wondered
how
many
Jaguar
stretch
limos
there
could
be
in
London.
Sophie's
connection
to
the
detective
seemed
to
be
taking
forever.
Come
on!
She
could
hear
the
line
clicking
and
buzzing,
as
if
she
was
being
transferred.
Fifteen
seconds
passed.
Finally
a
man
came
on
the
line.
"Agent
Neveu?"
Stunned,
Sophie
registered
the
gruff
tone
immediately.
"Agent
Neveu,"
Bezu
Fache
demanded.
"Where
the
hell
are
you?"
Sophie
was
speechless.
Captain
Fache
had
apparently
requested
the
London
police
dispatcher
alert
him
if
Sophie
called
in.
"Listen,"
Fache
said,
speaking
to
her
in
terse
French.
"I
made
a
terrible
mistake
tonight.
Robert
Langdon
is
innocent.
All
charges
against
him
have
been
dropped.
Even
so,
both
of
you
are
in
danger.
You
need
to
come
in."
Sophie's
jaw
fell
slack.
She
had
no
idea
how
to
respond.
Fache
was
not
a
man
who
apologized
for
anything.
"You
did
not
tell
me,"
Fache
continued,
"that
Jacques
Sauniere
was
your
grandfather.
I
fully
intend
to
overlook
your
insubordination
last
night
on
account
of
the
emotional
stress
you
must
be
under.
At
the
moment,
however,
you
and
Langdon
need
to
go
to
the
nearest
London
police
headquarters
for
refuge."
He
knows
I'm
in
London?
What
else
does
Fache
know?
Sophie
heard
what
sounded
like
drilling
or
machinery
in
the
background.
She
also
heard
an
odd
clicking
on
the
line.
"Are
you
tracing
this
call,
Captain?"
Fache's
voice
was
firm
now.
"You
and
I
need
to
cooperate,
Agent
Neveu.
We
both
have
a
lot
to
lose
here.
This
is
damage
control.
I
made
errors
in
judgment
last
night,
and
if
those
errors
result
in
the
deaths
of
an
American
professor
and
a
DCPJ
cryptologist,
my
career
will
be
over.
I've
been
trying
to
pull
you
back
into
safety
for
the
last
several
hours."
A
warm
wind
was
now
pushing
through
the
station
as
a
train
approached
with
a
low
rumble.
Sophie
had
every
intention
of
being
on
it.
Langdon
apparently
had
the
same
idea;
he
was
gathering
himself
together
and
moving
toward
her
now.
"The
man
you
want
is
Remy
Legaludec,"
Sophie
said.
"He
is
Teabing's
servant.
He
just
kidnapped
Teabing
inside
the
Temple
Church
and
"Agent
Neveu!"
Fache
bellowed
as
the
train
thundered
into
the
station.
"This
is
not
something
to
discuss
on
an
open
line.
You
and
Langdon
will
come
in
now.
For
your
own
well
being!
That
is
a
direct
order!"
Sophie
hung
up
and
dashed
with
Langdon
onto
the
train.
The
immaculate
cabin
of
Teabing's
Hawker
was
now
covered
with
steel
shavings
and
smelled
of
compressed
air
and
propane.
Bezu
Fache
had
sent
everyone
away
and
sat
alone
with
his
drink
and
the
heavy
wooden
box
found
in
Teabing's
safe.
Running
his
finger
across
the
inlaid
Rose,
he
lifted
the
ornate
lid.
Inside
he
found
a
stone
cylinder
with
lettered
dials.
The
five
dials
were
arranged
to
spell
SOFIA.
Fache
stared
at
the
word
a
long
moment
and
then
lifted
the
cylinder
from
its
padded
resting
place
and
examined
every
inch.
Then,
pulling
slowly
on
the
ends,
Fache
slid
off
one
of
the
end
caps.
The
cylinder
was
empty.
Fache
set
it
back
in
the
box
and
gazed
absently
out
the
jet's
window
at
the
hangar,
pondering
his
brief
conversation
with
Sophie,
as
well
as
the
information
he'd
received
from
PTS
in
Chateau
Villette.
The
sound
of
his
phone
shook
him
from
his
daydream.
It
was
the
DCPJ
switchboard.
The
dispatcher
was
apologetic.
The
president
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
had
been
calling
repeatedly,
and
although
he
had
been
told
several
times
that
the
captain
was
in
London
on
business,
he
just
kept
calling.
Begrudgingly
Fache
told
the
operator
to
forward
the
call.
"Monsieur
Vernet,"
Fache
said,
before
the
man
could
even
speak,
"I
am
sorry
I
did
not
call
you
earlier.
I
have
been
busy.
As
promised,
the
name
of
your
bank
has
not
appeared
in
the
media.
So
what
precisely
is
your
concern?"
Vernet's
voice
was
anxious
as
he
told
Fache
how
Langdon
and
Sophie
had
extracted
a
small
wooden
box
from
the
bank
and
then
persuaded
Vernet
to
help
them
escape.
"Then
when
I
heard
on
the
radio
that
they
were
criminals,"
Vernet
said,
"I
pulled
over
and
demanded
the
box
back,
but
they
attacked
me
and
stole
the
truck.
"You
are
concerned
for
a
wooden
box,"
Fache
said,
eyeing
the
Rose
inlay
on
the
cover
and
again
gently
opening
the
lid
to
reveal
the
white
cylinder.
"Can
you
tell
me
what
was
in
the
box?"
"The
contents
are
immaterial,"
Vernet
fired
back.
"I
am
concerned
with
the
reputation
of
my
bank.
We
have
never
had
a
robbery.
Ever.
It
will
ruin
us
if
I
cannot
recover
this
property
on
behalf
of
my
client."
"You
said
Agent
Neveu
and
Robert
Langdon
had
a
password
and
a
key.
What
makes
you
say
they
stole
the
box?"
"They
murdered
people
tonight.
Including
Sophie
Neveu's
grandfather.
The
key
and
password
were
obviously
ill
gotten."
"Mr.
Vernet,
my
men
have
done
some
checking
into
your
background
and
your
interests.
You
are
obviously
a
man
of
great
culture
and
refinement.
I
would
imagine
you
are
a
man
of
honor,
as
well.
As
am
I.
That
said,
I
give
you
my
word
as
commanding
officer
of
the
Police
Judiciaire
that
your
box,
along
with
your
bank's
reputation,
are
in
the
safest
of
hands."
High
in
the
hayloft
at
Chateau
Villette,
Collet
stared
at
the
computer
monitor
in
amazement.
"This
system
is
eavesdropping
on
all
these
locations?"
"Yes,"
the
agent
said.
"It
looks
like
data
has
been
collected
for
over
a
year
now."
Collet
read
the
list
again,
speechless.
COLBERT
SOSTAQUE
Chairman
of
the
Conseil
Constitutionnel
JEAN
CHAFFEE
Curator,
Musee
du
Jeu
de
Paume
EDOUARD
DESROCHERS
Senior
Archivist,
Mitterrand
Library
JACQUES
SAUNIERE
Curator,
Musee
du
Louvre
MICHEL
BRETON
Head
of
DAS
(French
Intelligence)
The
agent
pointed
to
the
screen.
"Number
four
is
of
obvious
concern."
Collet
nodded
blankly.
He
had
noticed
it
immediately.
Jacques
Sauniere
was
being
bugged.
He
looked
at
the
rest
of
the
list
again.
How
could
anyone
possibly
manage
to
bug
these
prominent
people?
"Have
you
heard
any
of
the
audio
files?"
"A
few.
Here's
one
of
the
most
recent."
The
agent
clicked
a
few
computer
keys.
The
speakers
crackled
to
life.
"Capitaine,
un
agent
du
Departement
de
Cryptographic
est
arrive.
Collet
could
not
believe
his
ears.
"That's
me!
That's
my
voice!"
He
recalled
sitting
at
Sauniere's
desk
and
radioing
Fache
in
the
Grand
Gallery
to
alert
him
of
Sophie
Neveu's
arrival.
The
agent
nodded.
"A
lot
of
our
Louvre
investigation
tonight
would
have
been
audible
if
someone
had
been
interested."
"Have
you
sent
anyone
in
to
sweep
for
the
bug?"
"No
need.
I
know
exactly
where
it
is."
The
agent
went
to
a
pile
of
old
notes
and
blueprints
on
the
worktable.
He
selected
a
page
and
handed
it
to
Collet.
"Look
familiar?"
Collet
was
amazed.
He
was
holding
a
photocopy
of
an
ancient
schematic
diagram,
which
depicted
a
rudimentary
machine.
He
was
unable
to
read
the
handwritten
Italian
labels,
and
yet
he
knew
what
he
was
looking
at.
A
model
for
a
fully
articulated
medieval
French
knight.
The
knight
sitting
on
Sauniere's
desk!
Collet's
eyes
moved
to
the
margins,
where
someone
had
scribbled
notes
on
the
photocopy
in
red
felt
tipped
marker.
The
notes
were
in
French
and
appeared
to
be
ideas
outlining
how
best
to
insert
a
listening
device
into
the
knight.
Silas
sat
in
the
passenger
seat
of
the
parked
Jaguar
limousine
near
the
Temple
Church.
His
hands
felt
damp
on
the
keystone
as
he
waited
for
Remy
to
finish
tying
and
gagging
Teabing
in
back
with
the
rope
they
had
found
in
the
trunk.
Finally,
Remy
climbed
out
of
the
rear
of
the
limo,
walked
around,
and
slid
into
the
driver's
seat
beside
Silas.
"Secure?"
Silas
asked.
Remy
chuckled,
shaking
off
the
rain
and
glancing
over
his
shoulder
through
the
open
partition
at
the
crumpled
form
of
Leigh
Teabing,
who
was
barely
visible
in
the
shadows
in
the
rear.
"He's
not
going
anywhere."
Silas
could
hear
Teabing's
muffled
cries
and
realized
Remy
had
used
some
of
the
old
duct
tape
to
gag
him.
"Ferme
ta
gueule!"
Remy
shouted
over
his
shoulder
at
Teabing.
Reaching
to
a
control
panel
on
the
elaborate
dash,
Remy
pressed
a
button.
An
opaque
partition
raised
behind
them,
sealing
off
the
back.
Teabing
disappeared,
and
his
voice
was
silenced.
Remy
glanced
at
Silas.
"I've
been
listening
to
his
miserable
whimpering
long
enough."
Minutes
later,
as
the
Jaguar
stretch
limo
powered
through
the
streets,
Silas's
cell
phone
rang.
The
Teacher.
He
answered
excitedly.
"Hello?"
"Silas,"
the
Teacher's
familiar
French
accent
said,
"I
am
relieved
to
hear
your
voice.
This
means
you
are
safe."
Silas
was
equally
comforted
to
hear
the
Teacher.
It
had
been
hours,
and
the
operation
had
veered
wildly
off
course.
Now,
at
last,
it
seemed
to
be
back
on
track.
"I
have
the
keystone."
"This
is
superb
news,"
the
Teacher
told
him.
"Is
Remy
with
you?"
Silas
was
surprised
to
hear
the
Teacher
use
Remy's
name.
"Yes.
Remy
freed
me."
"As
I
ordered
him
to
do.
I
am
only
sorry
you
had
to
endure
captivity
for
so
long."
"Physical
discomfort
has
no
meaning.
The
important
thing
is
that
the
keystone
is
ours."
"Yes.
I
need
it
delivered
to
me
at
once.
Time
is
of
the
essence."
Silas
was
eager
to
meet
the
Teacher
face
to
face
at
last.
"Yes,
sir,
I
would
be
honored."
"Silas,
I
would
like
Remy
to
bring
it
to
me."
Remy?
Silas
was
crestfallen.
After
everything
Silas
had
done
for
the
Teacher,
he
had
believed
he
would
be
the
one
to
hand
over
the
prize.
The
Teacher
favors
Remy?
"I
sense
your
disappointment,"
the
Teacher
said,
"which
tells
me
you
do
not
understand
my
meaning."
He
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper.
"You
must
believe
that
I
would
much
prefer
to
receive
the
keystone
from
you
a
man
of
God
rather
than
a
criminal
but
Remy
must
be
dealt
with.
He
disobeyed
my
orders
and
made
a
grave
mistake
that
has
put
our
entire
mission
at
risk.
Silas
felt
a
chill
and
glanced
over
at
Remy.
Kidnapping
Teabing
had
not
been
part
of
the
plan,
and
deciding
what
to
do
with
him
posed
a
new
problem.
"You
and
I
are
men
of
God,"
the
Teacher
whispered.
"We
cannot
be
deterred
from
our
goal."
There
was
an
ominous
pause
on
the
line.
"For
this
reason
alone,
I
will
ask
Remy
to
bring
me
the
keystone.
Do
you
understand?"
Silas
sensed
anger
in
the
Teacher's
voice
and
was
surprised
the
man
was
not
more
understanding.
Showing
his
face
could
not
be
avoided,
Silas
thought.
Remy
did
what
he
had
to
do.
He
saved
the
keystone.
"I
understand,"
Silas
managed.
"Good.
For
your
own
safety,
you
need
to
get
off
the
street
immediately.
The
police
will
be
looking
for
the
limousine
soon,
and
I
do
not
want
you
caught.
Opus
Dei
has
a
residence
in
London,
no?"
"Of
course."
"And
you
are
welcome
there?"
"As
a
brother."
"Then
go
there
and
stay
out
of
sight.
I
will
call
you
the
moment
I
am
in
possession
of
the
keystone
and
have
attended
to
my
current
problem.
"You
are
in
London?"
"Do
as
I
say,
and
everything
will
be
fine."
"Yes,
sir."
The
Teacher
heaved
a
sigh,
as
if
what
he
now
had
to
do
was
profoundly
regrettable.
"It's
time
I
speak
to
Remy."
Silas
handed
Remy
the
phone,
sensing
it
might
be
the
last
call
Remy
Legaludec
ever
took.
As
Remy
took
the
phone,
he
knew
this
poor,
twisted
monk
had
no
idea
what
fate
awaited
him
now
that
he
had
served
his
purpose.
The
Teacher
used
you,
Silas.
And
your
bishop
is
a
pawn.
Remy
still
marveled
at
the
Teacher's
powers
of
persuasion.
Bishop
Aringarosa
had
trusted
everything.
He
had
been
blinded
by
his
own
desperation.
Aringarosa
was
far
too
eager
to
believe.
Although
Remy
did
not
particularly
like
the
Teacher,
he
felt
pride
at
having
gained
the
man's
trust
and
helped
him
so
substantially.
have
earned
my
payday.
"Listen
carefully,"
the
Teacher
said.
"Take
Silas
to
the
Opus
Dei
residence
hall
and
drop
him
off
a
few
streets
away.
Then
drive
to
St.
James's
Park.
It
is
adjacent
to
Parliament
and
Big
Ben.
You
can
park
the
limousine
on
Horse
Guards
Parade.
We'll
talk
there."
With
that,
the
connection
went
dead.
King's
College,
established
by
King
George
IV
in
1829,
houses
its
Department
of
Theology
and
Religious
Studies
adjacent
to
Parliament
on
property
granted
by
the
Crown.
King's
College
Religion
Department
boasts
not
only
150
years'
experience
in
teaching
and
research,
but
the

which
possesses

of

complete
and
electronically
advanced
religious
research
libraries
in
the
world.
Langdon
still
felt
shaky
as
he
and
Sophie
came
in
from
the
rain
and
entered
the
library.
The
primary
research
room
was
as
Teabing
had
described
it
a
dramatic
octagonal
chamber
dominated
by
an
enormous
round
table
around
which
King
Arthur
and
his
knights
might
have
been
comfortable
were
it
not
for
the
presence
of
twelve
flat
screen
computer
workstations.
On
the
far
side
of
the
room,
a
reference
librarian
was
just
pouring
a
pot
of
tea
and
settling
in
for
her
day
of
work.
"Lovely
morning,"
she
said
in
a
cheerful
British
accent,
leaving
the
tea
and
walking
over.
"May
I
help
you?"
"Thank
you,
yes,"
Langdon
replied.
"My
name
is
"Robert
Langdon."
She
gave
a
pleasant
smile.
"I
know
who
you
are."
For
an
instant,
he
feared
Fache
had
put
him
on
English
television
as
well,
but
the
librarian's
smile
suggested
otherwise.
Langdon
still
had
not
gotten
used
to
these
moments
of
unexpected
celebrity.
Then
again,
if
anyone
on
earth
were
going
to
recognize
his
face,
it
would
be
a
librarian
in
a
Religious
Studies
reference
facility.
"Pamela
Gettum,"
the
librarian
said,
offering
her
hand.
She
had
a
genial,
erudite
face
and
a
pleasingly
fluid
voice.
The
horn
rimmed
glasses
hanging
around
her
neck
were
thick.
"A
pleasure,"
Langdon
said.
"This
is
my
friend
Sophie
Neveu."
The
two
women
greeted
one
another,
and
Gettum
turned
immediately
back
to
Langdon.
"I
didn't
know
you
were
coming."
"Neither
did
we.
If
it's
not
too
much
trouble,
we
could
really
use
your
help
finding
some
information."
Gettum
shifted,
looking
uncertain.
"Normally
our
services
are
by
petition
and
appointment
only,
unless
of
course
you're
the
guest
of
someone
at
the
college?"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"I'm
afraid
we've
come
unannounced.
A
friend
of
mine
speaks
very
highly
of
you.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing?"
Langdon
felt
a
pang
of
gloom
as
he
said
the
name.
"The
British
Royal
Historian."
Gettum
brightened
now,
laughing.
"Heavens,
yes.
What
a
character.
Fanatical!
Every
time
he
comes
in,
it's
always
the
same
search
strings.
Grail.
Grail.
Grail.
I
swear
that
man
will
die
before
he
gives
up
on
that
quest."
She
winked.
"Time
and
money
afford
one
such
lovely
luxuries,
wouldn't
you
say?
A
regular
Don
Quixote,
that
one."
"Is
there
any
chance
you
can
help
us?"
Sophie
asked.
"It's
quite
important."
Gettum
glanced
around
the
deserted
library
and
then
winked
at
them
both.
"Well,
I
can't
very
well
claim
I'm
too
busy,
now
can
I?
As
long
as
you
sign
in,
I
can't
imagine
anyone
being
too
upset.
What
did
you
have
in
mind?"
"We're
trying
to
find
a
tomb
in
London."
Gettum
looked
dubious.
"We've
got
about
twenty
thousand
of
them.
Can
you
be
a
little
more
specific?"
"It's
the
tomb
of
a
knight.
We
don't
have
a
name."
"A
knight.
That
tightens
the
net
substantially.
Much
less
common."
"We
don't
have
much
information
about
the
knight
we're
looking
for,"
Sophie
said,
"but
this
is
what
we
know."
She
produced
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
she
had
written
only
the
first
two
lines
of
the
poem.
Hesitant
to
show
the
entire
poem
to
an
outsider,
Langdon
and
Sophie
had
decided
to
share
just
the
first
two
lines,
those
that
identified
the
knight.
Compartmentalized
cryptography,
Sophie
had
called
it.
When
an
intelligence
agency
intercepted
a
code
containing
sensitive
data,
cryptographers
each
worked
on
a
discrete
section
of
the
code.
This
way,
when
they
broke
it,
no
single
cryptographer
possessed
the
entire
deciphered
message.
In
this
case,
the
precaution
was
probably
excessive;
even
if
this
librarian
saw
the
entire
poem,
identified
the
knight's
tomb,
and
knew
what
orb
was
missing,
the
information
was
useless
without
the
cryptex.
Gettum
sensed
an
urgency
in
the
eyes
of
this
famed
American
scholar,
almost
as
if
his
finding
this
tomb
quickly
were
a
matter
of
critical
importance.
The
green
eyed
woman
accompanying
him
also
seemed
anxious.
Puzzled,
Gettum
put
on
her
glasses
and
examined
the
paper
they
had
just
handed
her.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
His
labor's
fruit
a
Holy
wrath
incurred.
She
glanced
at
her
guests.
"What
is
this?
Some
kind
of
Harvard
scavenger
hunt?"
Langdon's
laugh
sounded
forced.
"Yeah,
something
like
that."
Gettum
paused,
feeling
she
was
not
getting
the
whole
story.
Nonetheless,
she
felt
intrigued
and
found
herself
pondering
the
verse
carefully.
"According
to
this
rhyme,
a
knight
did
something
that
incurred
displeasure
with
God,
and
yet
a
Pope
was
kind
enough
to
bury
him
in
London."
Langdon
nodded.
"Does
it
ring
any
bells?"
Gettum
moved
toward
one
of
the
workstations.
"Not
offhand,
but
let's
see
what
we
can
pull
up
in
the
database."
Over
the
past
two
decades,
King's
College
Research
Institute
in
Systematic
Theology
had
used
optical
character
recognition
software
in
unison
with
linguistic
translation
devices
to
digitize
and
catalog
an
enormous
collection
of
texts
encyclopedias
of
religion,
religious
biographies,
sacred
scriptures
in
dozens
of
languages,
histories,
Vatican
letters,
diaries
of
clerics,
anything
at
all
that
qualified
as
writings
on
human
spirituality.
Because
the
massive
collection
was
now
in
the
form
of
bits
and
bytes
rather
than
physical
pages,
the
data
was
infinitely
more
accessible.
Settling
into
one
of
the
workstations,
Gettum
eyed
the
slip
of
paper
and
began
typing.
"To
begin,
we'll
run
a
straight
Boolean
with
a
few
obvious
keywords
and
see
what
happens."
"Thank
you."
Gettum
typed
in
a
few
words:
LONDON,
KNIGHT,
POPE
As
she
clicked
the
SEARCH
button,
she
could
feel
the
hum
of
the
massive
mainframe
downstairs
scanning
data
at
a
rate
of
500
MBsec.
"I'm
asking
the
system
to
show
us
any
documents
whose
complete
text
contains
all
three
of
these
keywords.
We'll
get
more
hits
than
we
want,
but
it's
a
good
place
to
start.
The
screen
was
already
showing
the
first
of
the
hits
now.
Painting
the
Pope.
The
Collected
Portraits
of
Sir
Joshua
Reynolds.
London
University
Press.
Gettum
shook
her
head.
"Obviously
not
what
you're
looking
for."
She
scrolled
to
the
next
hit.
The
London
Writings
of
Alexander
Pope
by
G.
Wilson
Knight.
Again
she
shook
her
head.
As
the
system
churned
on,
the
hits
came
up
more
quickly
than
usual.
Dozens
of
texts
appeared,
many
of
them
referencing
the
eighteenth
century
British
writer
Alexander
Pope,
whose
counterreligious,
mock
epic
poetry
apparently
contained
plenty
of
references
to
knights
and
London.
Gettum
shot
a
quick
glance
to
the
numeric
field
at
the
bottom
of
the
screen.
This
computer,
by
calculating
the
current
number
of
hits
and
multiplying
by
the
percentage
of
the
database
left
to
search,
provided
a
rough
guess
of
how
much
information
would
be
found.
This
particular
search
looked
like
it
was
going
to
return
an
obscenely
large
amount
of
data.
Estimated
number
of
total
hits:
2,692
"We
need
to
refine
the
parameters
further,"
Gettum
said,
stopping
the
search.
"Is
this
all
the
information
you
have
regarding
the
tomb?
There's
nothing
else
to
go
on?"
Langdon
glanced
at
Sophie
Neveu,
looking
uncertain.
This
is
no
scavenger
hunt,
Gettum
sensed.
She
had
heard
the
whisperings
of
Robert
Langdon's
experience
in
Rome
last
year.
This
American
had
been
granted
access
to
the
most
secure
library
on
earth
the
Vatican
Secret
Archives.
She
wondered
what
kinds
of
secrets
Langdon
might
have
learned
inside
and
if
his
current
desperate
hunt
for
a
mysterious
London
tomb
might
relate
to
information
he
had
gained
within
the
Vatican.
Gettum
had
been
a
librarian
long
enough
to
know
the
most
common
reason
people
came
to
London
to
look
for
knights.
The
Grail.
Gettum
smiled
and
adjusted
her
glasses.
"You
are
friends
with
Leigh
Teabing,
you
are
in
England,
and
you
are
looking
for
a
knight."
She
folded
her
hands.
"I
can
only
assume
you
are
on
a
Grail
quest."
Langdon
and
Sophie
exchanged
startled
looks.
Gettum
laughed.
"My
friends,
this
library
is
a
base
camp
for
Grail
seekers.
Leigh
Teabing
among
them.
I
wish
I
had
a
shilling
for
every
time
I'd
run
searches
for
the
Rose,
Mary
Magdalene,
Sangreal,
Merovingian,
Priory
of
Sion,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
Everyone
loves
a
conspiracy."
She
took
off
her
glasses
and
eyed
them.
"I
need
more
information."
In
the
silence,
Gettum
sensed
her
guests'
desire
for
discretion
was
quickly
being
outweighed
by
their
eagerness
for
a
fast
result.
"Here,"
Sophie
Neveu
blurted.
"This
is
everything
we
know."
Borrowing
a
pen
from
Langdon,
she
wrote
two
more
lines
on
the
slip
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
Gettum.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
Gettum
gave
an
inward
smile.
The
Grail
indeed,
she
thought,
noting
the
references
to
the
Rose
and
her
seeded
womb.
"I
can
help
you,"
she
said,
looking
up
from
the
slip
of
paper.
"Might
I
ask
where
this
verse
came
from?
And
why
you
are
seeking
an
orb?"
"You
might
ask,"
Langdon
said,
with
a
friendly
smile,
"but
it's
a
long
story
and
we
have
very
little
time."
"Sounds
like
a
polite
way
of
saying
'mind
your
own
business.'
"We
would
be
forever
in
your
debt,
Pamela,"
Langdon
said,
"if
you
could
find
out
who
this
knight
is
and
where
he
is
buried."
"Very
well,"
Gettum
said,
typing
again.
"I'll
play
along.
If
this
is
a
Grail
related
issue,
we
should
cross
reference
against
Grail
keywords.
I'll
add
a
proximity
parameter
and
remove
the
title
weighting.
That
will
limit
our
hits
only
to
those
instances
of
textual
keywords
that
occur
near
a
Grail
related
word."

"How
long
will
this
take?"
Sophie
asked.
"A
few
hundred
terabytes
with
multiple
cross
referencing
fields?"
Gettum's
eyes
glimmered
as
she
clicked
the
SEARCH
key.
"A
mere
fifteen
minutes."
Langdon
and
Sophie
said
nothing,
but
Gettum
sensed
this
sounded
like
an
eternity
to
them.
"Tea?"
Gettum
asked,
standing
and
walking
toward
the
pot
she
had
made
earlier.
"Leigh
always
loves
my
tea.
London's
Opus
Dei
Centre
is
a
modest
brick
building
at
5
Orme
Court,
overlooking
the
North
Walk
at
Kensington
Gardens.
Silas
had
never
been
here,
but
he
felt
a
rising
sense
of
refuge
and
asylum
as
he
approached
the
building
on
foot.
Despite
the
rain,
Remy
had
dropped
him
off
a
short
distance
away
in
order
to
keep
the
limousine
off
the
main
streets.
Silas
didn't
mind
the
walk.
The
rain
was
cleansing.
At
Remy's
suggestion,
Silas
had
wiped
down
his
gun
and
disposed
of
it
through
a
sewer
grate.
He
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
it.
He
felt
lighter.
His
legs
still
ached
from
being
bound
all
that
time,
but
Silas
had
endured
far
greater
pain.
He
wondered,
though,
about
Teabing,
whom
Remy
had
left
bound
in
the
back
of
the
limousine.
The
Briton
certainly
had
to
be
feeling
the
pain
by
now.
"What
will
you
do
with
him?"
Silas
had
asked
Remy
as
they
drove
over
here.
Remy
had
shrugged.
"That
is
a
decision
for
the
Teacher."
There
was
an
odd
finality
in
his
tone.
Now,
as
Silas
approached
the
Opus
Dei
building,
the
rain
began
to
fall
harder,
soaking
his
heavy
robe,
stinging
the
wounds
of
the
day
before.
He
was
ready
to
leave
behind
the
sins
of
the
last
twenty
four
hours
and
purge
his
soul.
His
work
was
done.
Moving
across
a
small
courtyard
to
the
front
door,
Silas
was
not
surprised
to
find
the
door
unlocked.
He
opened
it
and
stepped
into
the
minimalist
foyer.
A
muted
electronic
chime
sounded
upstairs
as
Silas
stepped
onto
the
carpet.
The
bell
was
a
common
feature
in
these
halls
where
the
residents
spent
most
of
the
day
in
their
rooms
in
prayer.
Silas
could
hear
movement
above
on
the
creaky
wood
floors.
A
man
in
a
cloak
came
downstairs.
"May
I
help
you?"
He
had
kind
eyes
that
seemed
not
even
to
register
Silas's
startling
physical
appearance.
"Thank
you.
My
name
is
Silas.
I
am
an
Opus
Dei
numerary."
"American?"
Silas
nodded.
"I
am
in
town
only
for
the
day.
Might
I
rest
here?"
"You
need
not
even
ask.
There
are
two
empty
rooms
on
the
third
floor.
Shall
I
bring
you
some
tea
and
bread?"
"Thank
you."
Silas
was
famished.
Silas
went
upstairs
to
a
modest
room
with
a
window,
where
he
took
off
his
wet
robe
and
knelt
down
to
pray
in
his
undergarments.
He
heard
his
host
come
up
and
lay
a
tray
outside
his
door.
Silas
finished
his
prayers,
ate
his
food,
and
lay
down
to
sleep.
Three
stories
below,
a
phone
was
ringing.
The
Opus
Dei
numerary
who
had
welcomed
Silas
answered
the
line.
"This
is
the
London
police,"
the
caller
said.
"We
are
trying
to
find
an
albino
monk.
We've
had
a
tip
off
that
he
might
be
there.
Have
you
seen
him?"
The
numerary
was
startled.
"Yes,
he
is
here.
Is
something
wrong?"
"He
is
there
now?"
"Yes,
upstairs
praying.
What
is
going
on?"
"Leave
him
precisely
where
he
is,"
the
officer
commanded.
"Don't
say
a
word
to
anyone.
I'm
sending
officers
over

St.
James's
Park
is
a
sea
of
green
in
the
middle
of
London,
a
public
park
bordering
the
palaces
of
Westminster,
Buckingham,
and
St.
James's.
Once
enclosed
by
King
Henry
VIII
and
stocked
with
deer
for
the
hunt,
St.
James's
Park
is
now
open
to
the
public.
On
sunny
afternoons,
Londoners
picnic
beneath
the
willows
and
feed
the
pond's
resident
pelicans,
whose
ancestors
were
a
gift
to
Charles
II
from
the
Russian
ambassador.
The
Teacher
saw
no
pelicans
today.
The
stormy
weather
had
brought
instead
seagulls
from
the
ocean.
The
lawns
were
covered
with
them
hundreds
of
white
bodies
all
facing
the
same
direction,
patiently
riding
out
the
damp
wind.
Despite
the
morning
fog,
the
park
afforded
splendid
views
of
the
Houses
of
Parliament
and
Big
Ben.
Gazing
across
the
sloping
lawns,
past
the
duck
pond
and
the
delicate
silhouettes
of
the
weeping
willows,
the
Teacher
could
see
the
spires
of
the
building
that
housed
the
knight's
tomb
the
real
reason
he
had
told
Remy
to
come
to
this
spot.
As
the
Teacher
approached
the
front
passenger
door
of
the
parked
limousine,
Remy
leaned
across
and
opened
the
door.
The
Teacher
paused
outside,
taking
a
pull
from
the
flask
of
cognac
he
was
carrying.
Then,
dabbing
his
mouth,
he
slid
in
beside
Remy
and
closed
the
door.
Remy
held
up
the
keystone
like
a
trophy.
"It
was
almost
lost."
"You
have
done
well,"
the
Teacher
said.
"We
have
done
well,"
Remy
replied,
laying
the
keystone
in
the
Teacher's
eager
hands.
The
Teacher
admired
it
a
long
moment,
smiling.
"And
the
gun?
You
wiped
it
down?"
"Back
in
the
glove
box
where
I
found
it."
"Excellent."
The
Teacher
took
another
drink
of
cognac
and
handed
the
flask
to
Remy.
"Let's
toast
our
success.
The
end
is
near."
Remy
accepted
the
bottle
gratefully.
The
cognac
tasted
salty,
but
Remy
didn't
care.
He
and
the
Teacher
were
truly
partners
now.
He
could
feel
himself
ascending
to
a
higher
station
in
life.

a
servant
again.
As
Remy
gazed
down
the
embankment
at
the
duck
pond
below,
Chateau
Villette
seemed
miles
away.
Taking
another
swig
from
the
flask,
Remy
could
feel
the
cognac
warming
his
blood.
The
warmth
in
Remy's
throat,
however,
mutated
quickly
to
an
uncomfortable
heat.
Loosening
his
bow
tie,
Remy
tasted
an
unpleasant
grittiness
and
handed
the
flask
back
to
the
Teacher.
"I've
probably
had
enough,"
he
managed,
weakly.
Taking
the
flask,
the
Teacher
said,
"Remy,
as
you
are
aware,
you
are
the
only
one
who
knows
my
face.
I
placed
enormous
trust
in
you."
"Yes,"
he
said,
feeling
feverish
as
he
loosened
his
tie
further.
"And
your
identity
shall
go
with
me
to
the
grave."
The
Teacher
was
silent
a
long
moment.
"I
believe
you."
Pocketing
the
flask
and
the
keystone,
the
Teacher
reached
for
the
glove
box
and
pulled
out
the
tiny
Medusa
revolver.
For
an
instant,
Remy
felt
a
surge
of
fear,
but
the
Teacher
simply
slipped
it
in
his
trousers
pocket.
What
is
he
doing?
Remy
felt
himself
sweating
suddenly.
"I
know
I
promised
you
freedom,"
the
Teacher
said,
his
voice
now
sounding
regretful.
"But
considering
your
circumstances,
this
is
the
best
I
can
do."
The
swelling
in
Remy's
throat
came
on
like
an
earthquake,
and
he
lurched
against
the
steering
column,
grabbing
his
throat
and
tasting
vomit
in
his
narrowing
esophagus.
He
let
out
a
muted
croak
of
a
scream,
not
even
loud
enough
to
be
heard
outside
the
car.
The
saltiness
in
the
cognac
now
registered.
I'm
being
murdered!
Incredulous,
Remy
turned
to
see
the
Teacher
sitting
calmly
beside
him,
staring
straight
ahead
out
the
windshield.
Remy's
eyesight
blurred,
and
he
gasped
for
breath.
I
made
everything
possible
for
him!
How
could
he
do
this!
Whether
the
Teacher
had
intended
to
kill
Remy
all
along
or
whether
it
had
been
Remy's
actions
in
the
Temple
Church
that
had
made
the
Teacher
lose
faith,
Remy
would
never
know.
Terror
and
rage
coursed
through
him
now.
Remy
tried
to
lunge
for
the
Teacher,
but
his
stiffening
body
could
barely
move.
trusted
you
with
everything!
Remy
tried
to
lift
his
clenched
fists
to
blow
the
horn,
but
instead
he
slipped
sideways,
rolling
onto
the
seat,
lying
on
his
side
beside
the
Teacher,
clutching
at
his
throat.
The
rain
fell
harder
now.
Remy
could
no
longer
see,
but
he
could
sense
his
oxygen
deprived
brain
straining
to
cling
to
his
last
faint
shreds
of
lucidity.
As
his
world
slowly
went
black,
Remy
Legaludec
could
have
sworn
he
heard
the
sounds
of
the
soft
Riviera
surf.
The
Teacher
stepped
from
the
limousine,
pleased
to
see
that
nobody
was
looking
in
his
direction.
had
no
choice,
he
told
himself,
surprised
how
little
remorse
he
felt
for
what
he
had
just
done.
Remy
sealed
his
own
fate.
The
Teacher
had
feared
all
along
that
Remy
might
need
to
be
eliminated
when
the
mission
was
complete,
but
by
brazenly
showing
himself
in
the
Temple
Church,
Remy
had
accelerated
the
necessity
dramatically.
Robert
Langdon's
unexpected
visit
to
Chateau
Villette
had
brought
the
Teacher
both
a
fortuitous
windfall
and
an
intricate
dilemma.
Langdon
had
delivered
the
keystone
directly
to
the
heart
of
the
operation,
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise,
and
yet
he
had
brought
the
police
on
his
tail.
Remy's
prints
were
all
over
Chateau
Villette,
as
well
as
in
the
barn's
listening
post,
where
Remy
had
carried
out
the
surveillance.
The
Teacher
was
grateful
he
had
taken
so
much
care
in
preventing
any
ties
between
Remy's
activities
and
his
own.
Nobody
could
implicate
the
Teacher
unless
Remy
talked,
and
that
was
no
longer
a
concern.
One
more
loose
end
to
tie
up
here,
the
Teacher
thought,
moving
now
toward
the
rear
door
of
the
limousine.
The
police
will
have
no
idea
what
happened
and
no
living
witness
left
to
tell
them.
Glancing
around
to
ensure
nobody
was
watching,
he
pulled
open
the
door
and
climbed
into
the
spacious
rear
compartment.
Minutes
later,
the
Teacher
was
crossing
St.
James's
Park.
Only
two
people
now
remain.
Langdon
and
Neveu.
They
were
more
complicated.
But
manageable.
At
the
moment,
however,
the
Teacher
had
the
cryptex
to
attend
to.
Gazing
triumphantly
across
the
park,
he
could
see
his
destination.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
As
soon
as
the
Teacher
had
heard
the
poem,
he
had
known
the
answer.
Even
so,
that
the
others
had
not
figured
it
out
was
not
surprising.
have
an
unfair
advantage.
Having
listened
to
Sauniere's
conversations
for
months
now,
the
Teacher
had
heard
the
Grand
Master
mention
this
famous
knight
on
occasion,
expressing
esteem
almost
matching
that
he
held
for
Da
Vinci.
The
poem's
reference
to
the
knight
was
brutally
simple
once
one
saw
it
a
credit
to
Sauniere's
wit
and
yet
how
this
tomb
would
reveal
the
final
password
was
still
a
mystery.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
The
Teacher
vaguely
recalled
photos
of
the
famous
tomb
and,
in
particular,
its
most
distinguishing
feature.
A
magnificent
orb.
The
huge
sphere
mounted
atop
the
tomb
was
almost
as
large
as
the
tomb
itself.
The
presence
of
the
orb
seemed
both
encouraging
and
troubling
to
the
Teacher.
On
one
hand,
it
felt
like
a
signpost,
and
yet,
according
to
the
poem,
the
missing
piece
of
the
puzzle
was
an
orb
that
ought
to
be
on
his
tomb
not
one
that
was
already
there.
He
was
counting
on
his
closer
inspection
of
the
tomb
to
unveil
the
answer.
The
rain
was
getting
heavier
now,
and
he
tucked
the
cryptex
deep
in
his
right
hand
pocket
to
protect
it
from
the
dampness.
He
kept
the
tiny
Medusa
revolver
in
his
left,
out
of
sight.
Within
minutes,
he
was
stepping
into
the
quiet
sanctuary
of
London's
grandest
nine
hundred
year
old
building.
Just
as
the
Teacher
was
stepping
out
of
the
rain,
Bishop
Aringarosa
was
stepping
into
it.
On
the
rainy
tarmac
at
Biggin
Hill
Executive
Airport,
Aringarosa
emerged
from
his
cramped
plane,
bundling
his
cassock
against
the
cold
damp.
He
had
hoped
to
be
greeted
by
Captain
Fache.
Instead
a
young
British
police
officer
approached
with
an
umbrella.
"Bishop
Aringarosa?
Captain
Fache
had
to
leave.
He
asked
me
to
look
after
you.
He
suggested
I
take
you
to
Scotland
Yard.
He
thought
it
would
be
safest."
Safest?
Aringarosa
looked
down
at
the
heavy
briefcase
of
Vatican
bonds
clutched
in
his
hand.
He
had
almost
forgotten.
"Yes,
thank
you."
Aringarosa
climbed
into
the
police
car,
wondering
where
Silas
could
be.
Minutes
later,
the
police
scanner
crackled
with
the
answer.
5
Orme
Court.
Aringarosa
recognized
the
address
instantly.
The
Opus
Dei
Centre
in
London.
He
spun
to
the
driver.
"Take
me
there
at
once!"
Langdon's
eyes
had
not
left
the
computer
screen
since
the
search
began.
Five
minutes.
Only
two
hits.
Both
irrelevant.
He
was
starting
to
get
worried.
Pamela
Gettum
was
in
the
adjoining
room,
preparing
hot
drinks.
Langdon
and
Sophie
had
inquired
unwisely
if
there
might
be
some
coffee
brewing
alongside
the
tea
Gettum
had
offered,
and
from
the
sound
of
the
microwave
beeps
in
the
next
room,
Langdon
suspected
their
request
was
about
to
be
rewarded
with
instant
Nescafe.
Finally,
the
computer
pinged
happily.
"Sounds
like
you
got
another,"
Gettum
called
from
the
next
room.
"What's
the
title?"
Langdon
eyed
the
screen.
Grail
Allegory
in
Medieval
Literature:
A
Treatise
on
Sir
Gawain
and
the
Green
Knight.
"Allegory
of
the
Green
Knight,"
he
called
back.
"No
good,"
Gettum
said.
"Not
many
mythological
green
giants
buried
in
London."
Langdon
and
Sophie
sat
patiently
in
front
of
the
screen
and
waited
through
two
more
dubious
returns.
When
the
computer
pinged
again,
though,
the
offering
was
unexpected.
DIE
OPERN
VON
RICHARD
WAGNER
"The
operas
of
Wagner?"
Sophie
asked.
Gettum
peeked
back
in
the
doorway,
holding
a
packet
of
instant
coffee.
"That
seems
like
a
strange
match.
Was
Wagner
a
knight?"
"No,"
Langdon
said,
feeling
a
sudden
intrigue.
"But
he
was
a
well
known
Freemason."
Along
with
Mozart,
Beethoven,
Shakespeare,
Gershwin,
Houdini,
and
Disney.
Volumes
had
been
written
about
the
ties
between
the
Masons
and
the
Knights
Templar,
the
Priory
of
Sion,
and
the
Holy
Grail.
"I
want
to
look
at
this
one.
How
do
I
see
the
full
text?"
"You
don't
want
the
full
text,"
Gettum
called.
"Click
on
the
hypertext
title.
The
computer
will
display
your
keyword
hits
along
with
mono
prelogs
and
triple
postlogs
for
context."
Langdon
had
no
idea
what
she
had
just
said,
but
he
clicked
anyway.
A
new
window
popped
up.

"Wrong

Langdon
said,
disappointed.
Even
so,
he
was
amazed
by
the
system's
ease
of
use.
The
keywords
with
context
were
enough
to
remind
him
that
Wagner's
opera
Parsifal
was
a
tribute
to
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ,
told
through
the
story
of
a
young
knight
on
a
quest
for
truth.
"Just
be
patient,"
Gettum
urged.
"It's
a

Let
the
machine
run."
Over
the
next
few
minutes,
the
computer
returned
several
more
Grail
references,
including
a
text
about
troubadours
France's
famous
wandering
minstrels.
Langdon
knew
it
was
no
coincidence
that
the
word
minstrel
and
minister
shared
an
etymological
root.
The
troubadours
were
the
traveling
servants
or
"ministers"
of
the
Church
of
Mary
Magdalene,
using
music
to
disseminate
the
story
of
the
sacred
feminine
among
the
common
folk.
To
this
day,
the
troubadours
sang
songs
extolling
the
virtues
of
"our
Lady"
a
mysterious
and
beautiful
woman
to
whom
they
pledged
themselves
forever.
Eagerly,
he
checked
the
hypertext
but
found
nothing.
The
computer
pinged
again.
KNIGHTS,
KNAVES,
POPES,
AND
PENTACLES:
THE
HISTORY
OF

THROUGH

"Not
surprising,"
Langdon
said
to
Sophie.
"Some
of
our
keywords
have
the
same
names
as
individual
cards."
He
reached
for
the
mouse
to
click
on
a
hyperlink.
"I'm
not
sure
if
your
grandfather
ever
mentioned
it
when
you
played
Tarot
with
him,
Sophie,
but
this
game
is
a
'flash
card
catechism'
into
the
story
of
the
Lost
Bride
and
her
subjugation
by
the
evil
Church."
Sophie
eyed
him,
looking
incredulous.
"I
had
no
idea."
"That's
the
point.
By
teaching
through
a
metaphorical
game,
the
followers
of
the
Grail
disguised
their
message
from
the
watchful
eye
of
the
Church."
Langdon
often
wondered
how
many
modern
card
players
had
any
clue
that
their
four
suits
spades,
hearts,
clubs,
diamonds
were
Grail
related
symbols
that
came
directly
from
Tarot's
four
suits
of
swords,
cups,
scepters,
and
pentacles.
Spades
were
Swords
The
blade.
Male.
Hearts
were
Cups
The
chalice.
Feminine.
Clubs
were
Scepters
The
Royal
Line.
The
flowering
staff.
Diamonds
were
Pentacles
The
goddess.
The
sacred
feminine.
Four
minutes
later,
as
Langdon
began
feeling
fearful
they
would
not
find
what
they
had
come
for,
the
computer
produced
another
hit.
The
Gravity
of
Genius:
Biography
of
a
Modern
Knight.
"Gravity
of
Genius?"
Langdon
called
out
to
Gettum.
"Bio
of
a
modern
knight?"
Gettum
stuck
her
head
around
the
corner.
"How
modern?
Please
don't
tell
me
it's
your
Sir
Rudy
Giuliani.
Personally,
I
found
that
one
a
bit
off
the
mark."
Langdon
had
his
own
qualms
about
the
newly
knighted
Sir
Mick
Jagger,
but
this
hardly
seemed
the
moment
to
debate
the
politics
of
modern
British
knighthood.
"Let's
have
a
look."
Langdon
summoned
up
the
hypertext
keywords.

Sophie
called
to
Gettum.
"It's

Gettum
shook
her
head
in
the
doorway.
"No

the
seat
of
English
Protestantism.
There's

Cream
and
sugar?"
Sophie
nodded.
Gettum
waited.
"Robert?"
Langdon's
heart
was
hammering.
He
pulled
his
eyes
from
the
screen
and
stood
up.
"Sir
Isaac
Newton
is
our
knight."
Sophie
remained
seated.
"What
are
you
talking
about?"
"Newton
is
buried
in
London,"
Langdon
said.
"His

And
he

What

"What

Sophie
pointed
to
the
poem.
"How

You
heard
Ms.
Gettum.
Newton
was
not
buried

Langdon
reached
for
the
mouse.
"Who
said
anything
about

Catholic
Pope?"
He
clicked
on
the
"Pope"
hyperlink,
and
the
complete
sentence
appeared.
Sir
Isaac
Newton's

attended
by
kings
and
nobles,
was
presided
over
by
Alexander
Pope,
friend
and
colleague,
who
gave
a
stirring
eulogy
before
sprinkling
dirt
on
the
tomb.
Langdon
looked
at
Sophie.
"We
had
the
correct
Pope
on
our
second
hit.
Alexander."
He
paused.
"A.Pope."
In
London
lies
a
knight
A.
Pope
interred.
Sophie
stood
up,
looking
stunned.
Jacques
Sauniere,
the
master
of
double
entendres,
had
proven
once
again
that
he
was
a
frighteningly
clever
man.
Silas
awoke
with
a
start.
He
had
no
idea
what
had
awoken
him
or
how
long
he
had
been
asleep.
Was
I
dreaming?
Sitting
up
now
on
his
straw
mat,
he
listened
to
the
quiet
breathing
of
the
Opus
Dei
residence
hall,
the
stillness
textured
only
by
the
soft
murmurs
of
someone
praying
aloud
in
a
room
below
him.
These
were
familiar
sounds
and
should
have
comforted
him.
And
yet
he
felt
a
sudden
and
unexpected
wariness.
Standing,
wearing
only
his
undergarments,
Silas
walked
to
the
window.
Was
I
followed?
The
courtyard
below
was
deserted,
exactly
as
he
had
seen
it
when
he
entered.
He
listened.
Silence.
So
why
am
I
uneasy?
Long
ago
Silas
had
learned
to
trust
his
intuition.
Intuition
had
kept
him
alive
as
a
child
on
the
streets
of
Marseilles
long
before
prison
long
before
he
was
born
again
by
the
hand
of
Bishop
Aringarosa.
Peering
out
the
window,
he
now
saw
the
faint
outline
of
a
car
through
the
hedge.
On
the
car's
roof
was
a
police
siren.
A
floorboard
creaked
in
the
hallway.
A
door
latch
moved.
Silas
reacted
on
instinct,
surging
across
the
room
and
sliding
to
a
stop
just
behind
the
door
as
it
crashed
open.
The
first
police
officer
stormed
through,
swinging
his
gun
left
then
right
at
what
appeared
an
empty
room.
Before
he
realized
where
Silas
was,
Silas
had
thrown
his
shoulder
into
the
door,
crushing
a
second
officer
as
he
came
through.
As
the
first
officer
wheeled
to
shoot,
Silas
dove
for
his
legs.
The
gun
went
off,
the
bullet
sailing
above
Silas's
head,
just
as
he
connected
with
the
officer's
shins,
driving
his
legs
out
from
under
him,
and
sending
the
man
down,
his
head
hitting
the
floor.
The
second
officer
staggered
to
his
feet
in
the
doorway,
and
Silas
drove
a
knee
into
his
groin,
then
went
clambering
over
the
writhing
body
into
the
hall.
Almost
naked,
Silas
hurled
his
pale
body
down
the
staircase.
He
knew
he
had
been
betrayed,
but
by
whom?
When
he
reached
the
foyer,
more
officers
were
surging
through
the
front
door.
Silas
turned
the
other
way
and
dashed
deeper
into
the
residence
hall.
The
women
's
entrance.
Every
Opus
Dei
building
has
one.
Winding
down
narrow
hallways,
Silas
snaked
through
a
kitchen,
past
terrified
workers,
who
left
to
avoid
the
naked
albino
as
he
knocked
over
bowls
and
silverware,
bursting
into
a
dark
hallway
near
the
boiler
room.
He
now
saw
the
door
he
sought,
an
exit
light
gleaming
at
the
end.
Running
full
speed
through
the
door
out
into
the
rain,
Silas
leapt
off
the
low
landing,
not
seeing
the
officer
coming
the
other
way
until
it
was
too
late.
The
two
men
collided,
Silas's
broad,
naked
shoulder
grinding
into
the
man's
sternum
with
crushing
force.
He
drove
the
officer
backward
onto
the
pavement,
landing
hard
on
top
of
him.
The
officer's
gun
clattered
away.
Silas
could
hear
men
running
down
the
hall
shouting.
Rolling,
he
grabbed
the
loose
gun
just
as
the
officers
emerged.
A
shot
rang
out
on
the
stairs,
and
Silas
felt
a
searing
pain
below
his
ribs.
Filled
with
rage,
he
opened
fire
at
all
three
officers,
their
blood
spraying.
A
dark
shadow
loomed
behind,
coming
out
of
nowhere.
The
angry
hands
that
grabbed
at
his
bare
shoulders
felt
as
if
they
were
infused
with
the
power
of
the
devil
himself.
The
man
roared
in
his
ear.
SILAS,
NO!
Silas
spun
and
fired.
Their
eyes
met.
Silas
was
already
screaming
in
horror
as
Bishop
Aringarosa
fell.
More
than
three
thousand
people
are
entombed
or
enshrined
within
Westminster
Abbey.
The
colossal
stone
interior
burgeons
with
the
remains
of
kings,
statesmen,
scientists,
poets,
and
musicians.
Their
tombs,
packed
into
every
last
niche
and
alcove,
range
in
grandeur
from
the
most
regal
of
mausoleums
that
of
Queen
Elizabeth
I,
whose
canopied
sarcophagus
inhabits
its
own
private,
apsidal
chapel
down
to
the
most
modest
etched
floor
tiles
whose
inscriptions
have
worn
away
with
centuries
of
foot
traffic,
leaving
it
to
one's
imagination
whose
relics
might
lie
below
the
tile
in
the
undercroft.
Designed
in
the
style
of
the
great
cathedrals
of
Amiens,
Chartres,
and
Canterbury,
Westminster
Abbey
is
considered
neither
cathedral
nor
parish
church.
It
bears
the
classification
of
royal
peculiar,
subject
only
to
the
Sovereign.
Since
hosting
the
coronation
of
William
the
Conqueror
on
Christmas
Day
in
1066,
the
dazzling
sanctuary
has
witnessed
an
endless
procession
of
royal
ceremonies
and
affairs
of
state
from
the
canonization
of
Edward
the
Confessor,
to
the
marriage
of
Prince
Andrew
and
Sarah
Ferguson,
to
the
funerals
of
Henry
V,
Queen
Elizabeth
I,
and
Lady
Diana.
Even
so,
Robert
Langdon
currently
felt
no
interest
in
any
of
the
abbey's
ancient
history,
save
one
event
the
funeral
of
the
British
knight
Sir
Isaac
Newton.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
Hurrying
through
the
grand
portico
on
the
north
transept,
Langdon
and
Sophie
were
met
by
guards
who
politely
ushered
them
through
the
abbey's
newest
addition
a
large
walk
through
metal
detector
now
present
in
most
historic
buildings
in
London.
They
both
passed
through
without
setting
off
the
alarm
and
continued
to
the
abbey
entrance.
Stepping
across
the
threshold
into
Westminster
Abbey,
Langdon
felt
the
outside
world
evaporate
with
a
sudden
hush.
No
rumble
of
traffic.
No
hiss
of
rain.
Just
a
deafening
silence,
which
seemed
to
reverberate
back
and
forth
as
if
the
building
were
whispering
to
itself.
Langdon's
and
Sophie's
eyes,
like
those
of
almost
every
visitor,
shifted
immediately
skyward,
where
the
abbey's
great
abyss
seemed
to
explode
overhead.
Gray
stone
columns
ascended
like
redwoods
into
the
shadows,
arching
gracefully
over
dizzying
expanses,
and
then
shooting
back
down
to
the
stone
floor.
Before
them,
the
wide
alley
of
the
north
transept
stretched
out
like
a
deep
canyon,
flanked
by
sheer
cliffs
of
stained
glass.
On
sunny
days,
the
abbey
floor
was
a
prismatic
patchwork
of
light.
Today,
the
rain
and
darkness
gave
this
massive
hollow
a
wraithlike
aura
more
like
that
of
the
crypt
it
truly
was.
"It's
practically
empty,"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
felt
disappointed.
He
had
hoped
for
a
lot
more
people.
A
more
public
place.
Their
earlier
experience
in
the
deserted
Temple
Church
was
not
one
Langdon
wanted
to
repeat.
He
had
been
anticipating
a
certain
feeling
of
security
in
the
popular
tourist
destination,
but
Langdon's
recollections
of
bustling
throngs
in
a
well
lit
abbey
had
been
formed
during
the
peak
summer
tourist
season.
Today
was
a
rainy
April
morning.
Rather
than
crowds
and
shimmering
stained
glass,
all
Langdon
saw
was
acres
of
desolate
floor
and
shadowy,
empty
alcoves.
"We
passed
through
metal
detectors,"
Sophie
reminded,
apparently
sensing
Langdon's
apprehension.
"If
anyone
is
in
here,
they
can't
be
armed."
Langdon
nodded
but
still
felt
circumspect.
He
had
wanted
to
bring
the
London
police
with
them,
but
Sophie's
fears
of
who
might
be
involved
put
a
damper
on
any
contact
with
the
authorities.
We
need
to
recover
the
cryptex,
Sophie
had
insisted.
It
is
the
key
to
everything.
She
was
right,
of
course.
The
key
to
getting
Leigh
back
alive.
The
key
to
finding
the
Holy
Grail.
The
key
to
learning
who
is
behind
this.
Unfortunately,
their
only
chance
to
recover
the
keystone
seemed
to
be
here
and
now
at
the
tomb
of
Isaac
Newton.
Whoever
held
the
cryptex
would
have
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
tomb
to
decipher
the
final
clue,
and
if
they
had
not
already
come
and
gone,
Sophie
and
Langdon
intended
to
intercept
them.
Striding
toward
the
left
wall
to
get
out
of
the
open,
they
moved
into
an
obscure
side
aisle
behind
a
row
of
pilasters.
Langdon
couldn't
shake
the
image
of
Leigh
Teabing
being
held
captive,
probably
tied
up
in
the
back
of
his
own
limousine.
Whoever
had
ordered
the
top
Priory
members
killed
would
not
hesitate
to
eliminate
others
who
stood
in
the
way.
It
seemed
a
cruel
irony
that
Teabing
a
modern
British
knight
was
a
hostage
in
the
search
for
his
own
countryman,
Sir
Isaac
Newton.
"Which
way
is
it?"
Sophie
asked,
looking
around.
The
tomb.
Langdon
had
no
idea.
"We
should
find
a
docent
and
ask."
Langdon
knew
better
than
to
wander
aimlessly
in
here.
Westminster
Abbey
was
a
tangled
warren
of
mausoleums,
perimeter
chambers,
and
walk
in
burial
niches.
Like
the
Louvre's
Grand
Gallery,
it
had
a
lone
point
of
entry
the
door
through
which
they
had
just
passed
easy
to
find
your
way
in,
but
impossible
to
find
your
way
out.
A
literal
tourist
trap,
one
of
Langdon's
befuddled
colleagues
had
called
it.
Keeping
architectural
tradition,
the
abbey
was
laid
out
in
the
shape
of
a
giant
crucifix.
Unlike
most
churches,
however,
it
had
its
entrance
on
the
side,
rather
than
the
standard
rear
of
the
church
via
the
narthex
at
the
bottom
of
the
nave.
Moreover,
the
abbey
had
a
series
of
sprawling
cloisters
attached.
One
false
step
through
the
wrong
archway,
and
a
visitor
was
lost
in
a
labyrinth
of
outdoor
passageways
surrounded
by
high
walls.
"Docents
wear
crimson
robes,"
Langdon
said,
approaching
the
center
of
the
church.
Peering
obliquely
across
the
towering
gilded
altar
to
the
far
end
of
the
south
transept,
Langdon
saw
several
people
crawling
on
their
hands
and
knees.
This
prostrate
pilgrimage
was
a
common
occurrence
in
Poets'
Corner,
although
it
was
far
less
holy
than
it
appeared.
Tourists
doing
grave
rubbings.
"I
don't
see
any
docents,"
Sophie
said.
"Maybe
we
can
find
the
tomb
on
our
own?"
Without
a
word,
Langdon
led
her
another
few
steps
to
the
center
of
the
abbey
and
pointed
to
the
right.
Sophie
drew
a
startled
breath
as
she
looked
down
the
length
of
the
abbey's
nave,
the
full
magnitude
of
the
building
now
visible.
"Aah,"
she
said.
"Let's
find
a
docent."
At
that
moment,
a
hundred
yards
down
the
nave,
out
of
sight
behind
the
choir
screen,
the
stately
tomb
of
Sir
Isaac
Newton
had
a
lone
visitor.
The
Teacher
had
been
scrutinizing
the
monument
for
ten
minutes
now.
Newton's
tomb
consisted
of
a
massive
black
marble
sarcophagus
on
which
reclined
the
sculpted
form
of
Sir
Isaac
Newton,
wearing
classical
costume,
and
leaning
proudly
against
a
stack
of
his
own
books
Divinity,
Chronology,
Opticks,
and
Philosophiae
Naturalis
Principia
Mathematica.
At
Newton's
feet
stood
two
winged
boys
holding
a
scroll.
Behind
Newton's
recumbent
body
rose
an
austere
pyramid.
Although
the
pyramid
itself
seemed
an
oddity,
it
was
the
giant
shape
mounted
halfway
up
the
pyramid
that
most
intrigued
the
Teacher.
An
orb.
The
Teacher
pondered
Sauniere's
beguiling
riddle.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
The
massive
orb
protruding
from
the
face
of
the
pyramid
was
carved
in
basso
relievo
and
depicted
all
kinds
of
heavenly
bodies
constellations,
signs
of
the
zodiac,
comets,
stars,
and
planets.
Above
it,
the
image
of
the
Goddess
of
Astronomy
beneath
a
field
of
stars.
Countless
orbs.
The
Teacher
had
been
convinced
that
once
he
found
the
tomb,
discerning
the
missing
orb
would
be
easy.
Now
he
was
not
so
sure.
He
was
gazing
at
a
complicated
map
of
the
heavens.
Was
there
a
missing
planet?
Had
some
astronomical
orb
been
omitted
from
a
constellation?
He
had
no
idea.
Even
so,
the
Teacher
could
not
help
but
suspect
that
the
solution
would
be
ingeniously
clean
and
simple
"a
knight
a
pope
interred."
What
orb
am
I
looking
for?
Certainly,
an
advanced
knowledge
of
astrophysics
was
not
a
prerequisite
for
finding
the
Holy
Grail,
was
it?
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
The
Teacher's
concentration
was
broken
by
several
approaching
tourists.
He
slipped
the
cryptex
back
in
his
pocket
and
watched
warily
as
the
visitors
went
to
a
nearby
table,
left
a
donation
in
the
cup,
and
restocked
on
the
complimentary
grave
rubbing
supplies
set
out
by
the
abbey.
Armed
with
fresh
charcoal
pencils
and
large
sheets
of
heavy
paper,
they
headed
off
toward
the
front
of
the
abbey,
probably
to
the
popular
Poets'
Corner
to
pay
their
respects
to
Chaucer,
Tennyson,
and
Dickens
by
rubbing
furiously
on
their
graves.
Alone
again,
he
stepped
closer
to
the
tomb,
scanning
it
from
bottom
to
top.
He
began
with
the
clawed
feet
beneath
the
sarcophagus,
moved
upward
past
Newton,
past
his
books
on
science,
past
the
two
boys
with
their
mathematical
scroll,
up
the
face
of
the
pyramid
to
the
giant
orb
with
its
constellations,
and
finally
up
to
the
niche's
star
filled
canopy.
What
orb
ought
to
be
here
and
yet
is
missing?
He
touched
the
cryptex
in
his
pocket
as
if
he
could
somehow
divine
the
answer
from
Sauniere's
crafted
marble.
Only
five
letters
separate
me
from
the
Grail.
Pacing
now
near
the
corner
of
the
choir
screen,
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
glanced
up
the
long
nave
toward
the
main
altar
in
the
distance.
His
gaze
dropped
from
the
gilded
altar
down
to
the
bright
crimson
robe
of
an
abbey
docent
who
was
being
waved
over
by
two
very
familiar
individuals.
Langdon
and
Neveu.
Calmly,
the
Teacher
moved
two
steps
back
behind
the
choir
screen.
That
was
fast.
He
had
anticipated
Langdon
and
Sophie
would
eventually
decipher
the
poem's
meaning
and
come
to
Newton's
tomb,
but
this
was
sooner
than
he
had
imagined.
Taking
a
deep
breath,
the
Teacher
considered
his
options.
He
had
grown
accustomed
to
dealing
with
surprises.
am
holding
the
cryptex.
Reaching
down
to
his
pocket,
he
touched
the
second
object
that
gave
him
his
confidence:
the
Medusa
revolver.
As
expected,
the
abbey's
metal
detectors
had
blared
as
the
Teacher
passed
through
with
the
concealed
gun.
Also
as
expected,
the
guards
had
backed
off
at
once
when
the
Teacher
glared
indignantly
and
flashed
his
identification
card.
Official
rank
always
commanded
the
proper
respect.
Although
initially
the
Teacher
had
hoped
to
solve
the
cryptex
alone
and
avoid
any
further
complications,
he
now
sensed
that
the
arrival
of
Langdon
and
Neveu
was
actually
a
welcome
development.
Considering
the
lack
of
success
he
was
having
with
the
"orb"
reference,
he
might
be
able
to
use
their
expertise.
After
all,
if
Langdon
had
deciphered
the
poem
to
find
the
tomb,
there
was
a
reasonable
chance
he
also
knew
something
about
the
orb.
And
if
Langdon
knew
the
password,
then
it
was
just
a
matter
of
applying
the
right
pressure.
Not
here,
of
course.
Somewhere
private.
The
Teacher
recalled
a
small
announcement
sign
he
had
seen
on
his
way
into
the
abbey.
Immediately
he
knew
the
perfect
place
to
lure
them.
The
only
question
now
what
to
use
as
bait.
Langdon
and
Sophie
moved
slowly
down
the
north
aisle,
keeping
to
the
shadows
behind
the
ample
pillars
that
separated
it
from
the
open
nave.
Despite
having
traveled
more
than
halfway
down
the
nave,
they
still
had
no
clear
view
of
Newton's
tomb.
The
sarcophagus
was
recessed
in
a
niche,
obscured
from
this
oblique
angle.
"At
least
there's
nobody
over
there,"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
nodded,
relieved.
The
entire
section
of
the
nave
near
Newton's
tomb
was
deserted.
"I'll
go
over,"
he
whispered.
"You
should
stay
hidden
just
in
case
someone
Sophie
had
already
stepped
from
the
shadows
and
was
headed
across
the
open
floor.
"
is
watching,"
Langdon
sighed,
hurrying
to
join
her.
Crossing
the
massive
nave
on
a
diagonal,
Langdon
and
Sophie
remained
silent
as
the
elaborate
sepulchre
revealed
itself
in
tantalizing
increments
a
black
marble
sarcophagus
a
reclining
statue
of
Newton
two
winged
boys
a
huge
pyramid
and
an
enormous
orb.
"Did
you
know
about
that?"
Sophie
said,
sounding
startled.
Langdon
shook
his
head,
also
surprised.
"Those
look
like
constellations
carved
on
it,"
Sophie
said.
As
they
approached
the
niche,
Langdon
felt
a
slow
sinking
sensation.
Newton's
tomb
was
covered
with
orbs
stars,
comets,
planets.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb?
It
could
turn
out
to
be
like
trying
to
find
a
missing
blade
of
grass
on
a
golf
course.
"Astronomical
bodies,"
Sophie
said,
looking
concerned.
"And
a
lot
of
them."
Langdon
frowned.
The
only
link
between
the
planets
and
the
Grail
that
Langdon
could
imagine
was
the
pentacle
of
Venus,
and
he
had
already
tried
the
password
"Venus"
en
route
to
the
Temple
Church.
Sophie
moved
directly
to
the
sarcophagus,
but
Langdon
hung
back
a
few
feet,
keeping
an
eye
on
the
abbey
around
them.
"Divinity,
"
Sophie
said,
tilting
her
head
and
reading
the
titles
of
the
books
on
which
Newton
was
leaning.
"Chronology.
Opticks.
Philosophiae
Naturalis
Principia
Mathematica?"
She
turned
to
him.
"Ring
any
bells?"
Langdon
stepped
closer,
considering
it.
"Principia
Mathematica,
as
I
remember,
has
something
to
do
with
the
gravitation
pull
of
planets
which
admittedly
are
orbs,
but
it
seems
a
little
far
fetched."
"How
about
the
signs
of
the
zodiac?"
Sophie
asked,
pointing
to
the
constellations
on
the
orb.
"You
were
talking
about
Pisces
and
Aquarius
earlier,
weren't
you?"
The
End
of
Days,
Langdon
thought.
"The
end
of
Pisces
and
the
beginning
of
Aquarius
was
allegedly
the
historical
marker
at
which
the
Priory
planned
to
release
the
Sangreal
documents
to
the
world."
But
the
millennium
came
and
went
without
incident,
leaving
historians
uncertain
when
the
truth
was
coming.
"It
seems
possible,"
Sophie
said,
"that
the
Priory's
plans
to
reveal
the
truth
might
be
related
to
the
last
line
of
the
poem."
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
Langdon
felt
a
shiver
of
potential.
He
had
not
considered
the
line
that
way
before.
"You
told
me
earlier,"
she
said,
"that
the
timing
of
the
Priory's
plans
to
unveil
the
truth
about
'the
Rose'
and
her
fertile
womb
was
linked
directly
to
the
position
of
planets
orbs."
Langdon
nodded,
feeling
the
first
faint
wisps
of
possibility
materializing.
Even
so,
his
intuition
told
him
astronomy
was
not
the
key.
The
Grand
Master's
previous
solutions
had
all
possessed
an
eloquent,
symbolic
significance
the
Mona
Lisa,
Madonna
of
the
Rocks,
SOFIA.
This
eloquence
was
definitely
lacking
in
the
concept
of
planetary
orbs
and
the
zodiac.
Thus
far,
Jacques
Sauniere
had
proven
himself
a
meticulous
code
writer,
and
Langdon
had
to
believe
that
his
final
password
those
five
letters
that
unlocked
the
Priory's
ultimate
secret
would
prove
to
be
not
only
symbolically
fitting
but
also
crystal
clear.
If
this
solution
were
anything
like
the
others,
it
would
be
painfully
obvious
once
it
dawned.
"Look!"
Sophie
gasped,
jarring
his
thoughts
as
she
grabbed
his
arm.
From
the
fear
in
her
touch
Langdon
sensed
someone
must
be
approaching,
but
when
he
turned
to
her,
she
was
staring
aghast
at
the
top
of
the
black
marble
sarcophagus.
"Someone
was
here,"
she
whispered,
pointing
to
a
spot
on
the
sarcophagus
near
Newton's
outstretched
right
foot.
Langdon
did
not
understand
her
concern.
A
careless
tourist
had
left
a
charcoal,
grave
rubbing
pencil
on
the
sarcophagus
lid
near
Newton's
foot.
It's
nothing.
Langdon
reached
out
to
pick
it
up,
but
as
he
leaned
toward
the
sarcophagus,
the
light
shifted
on
the
polished
black
marble
slab,
and
Langdon
froze.
Suddenly,
he
saw
why
Sophie
was
afraid.
Scrawled
on
the
sarcophagus
lid,
at
Newton's
feet,
shimmered
a
barely
visible
charcoal
pencil
message:
I
have
Teabing.
Go
through
Chapter
House,
out
south
exit,
to
public
garden.
Langdon
read
the
words
twice,
his
heart
pounding
wildly.
Sophie
turned
and
scanned
the
nave.
Despite
the
pall
of
trepidation
that
settled
over
him
upon
seeing
the
words,
Langdon
told
himself
this
was
good
news.
Leigh
is
still
alive.
There
was
another
implication
here
too.
"They
don't
know
the
password
either,"
he
whispered.
Sophie
nodded.
Otherwise
why
make
their
presence
known?
"They
may
want
to
trade
Leigh
for
the
password."
"Or
it's
a
trap."
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"I
don't
think
so.
The
garden
is
outside
the
abbey
walls.
A
very
public
place."
Langdon
had
once
visited
the
abbey's
famous
College
Garden
a
small
fruit
orchard
and
herb
garden
left
over
from
the
days
when
monks
grew
natural
pharmacological
remedies
here.
Boasting
the
oldest
living
fruit
trees
in
Great
Britain,
College
Garden
was
a
popular
spot
for
tourists
to
visit
without
having
to
enter
the
abbey.
"I
think
sending
us
outside
is
a
show
of
faith.
So
we
feel
safe."
Sophie
looked
dubious.
"You
mean
outside,
where
there
are
no
metal
detectors?"
Langdon
scowled.
She
had
a
point.
Gazing
back
at
the
orb
filled
tomb,
Langdon
wished
he
had
some
idea
about
the
cryptex
password
something
with
which
to
negotiate.
got
Leigh
involved
in
this,
and
I'll
do
whatever
it
takes
if
there
is
a
chance
to
help
him.
"The
note
says
to
go
through
the
Chapter
House
to
the
south
exit,"
Sophie
said.
"Maybe
from
the
exit
we
would
have
a
view
of
the
garden?
That
way
we
could
assess
the
situation
before
we
walked
out
there
and
exposed
ourselves
to
any
danger?"
The
idea
was
a
good
one.
Langdon
vaguely
recalled
the
Chapter
House
as
a
huge
octagonal
hall
where
the
original
British
Parliament
convened
in
the
days
before
the
modern
Parliament
building
existed.
It
had
been
years
since
he
had
been
there,
but
he
remembered
it
being
out
through
the
cloister
somewhere.
Taking
several
steps
back
from
the
tomb,
Langdon
peered
around
the
choir
screen
to
his
right,
across
the
nave
to
the
side
opposite
that
which
they
had
descended.
A
gaping
vaulted
passageway
stood
nearby,
with
a
large
sign.
THIS
WAY
TO:
CLOISTERS
DEANERY
COLLEGE
HALL
MUSEUM
PYX
CHAMBER
ST.
FAITH'S
CHAPEL
Langdon
and
Sophie
were
jogging
as
they
passed
beneath
the
sign,
moving
too
quickly
to
notice
the
small
announcement
apologizing
that
certain
areas
were
closed
for
renovations.
They
emerged
immediately
into
a
high
walled,
open
roof
courtyard
through
which
morning
rain
was
falling.
Above
them,
the
wind
howled
across
the
opening
with
a
low
drone,
like
someone
blowing
over
the
mouth
of
a
bottle.
Entering
the
narrow,
low
hanging
walkways
that
bordered
the
courtyard
perimeter,
Langdon
felt
the
familiar
uneasiness
he
always
felt
in
enclosed
spaces.
These
walkways
were
called
cloisters,
and
Langdon
noted
with
uneasiness
that
these
particular
cloisters
lived
up
to
their
Latin
ties
to
the
word
claustrophobic.
Focusing
his
mind
straight
ahead
toward
the
end
of
the
tunnel,
Langdon
followed
the
signs
for
the
that
blew
through
the
lone
pillared
wall
that
was
the
cloister's
only
source
of
light.
Another
couple
scurried
past
them
the
other
way,
hurrying
to
get
out
of
the
worsening
weather.
The
cloisters
looked
deserted
now,
admittedly
the
abbey's
least
enticing
section
in
the
wind
and
rain.
Forty
yards
down
the
east
cloister,
an
archway
materialized
on
their
left,
giving
way
to
another
hallway.
Although
this
was
the
entrance
they
were
looking
for,
the
opening
was
cordoned
off
by
a
swag
and
an
official
looking
sign.
CLOSED
FOR
RENOVATION
PYX
CHAMBER
ST.
FAITH'S
CHAPEL
The
long,
deserted
corridor
beyond
the
swag
was
littered
with
scaffolding
and
drop
cloths.
Immediately
beyond
the
swag,
Langdon
could
see
the
entrances
to
the
Pyx
Chamber
and
St.
Faith's
Chapel
on
the
right
and
left.
The
entrance
to
the
Chapter
House,
however,
was
much
farther
away,
at
the
far
end
of
the
long
hallway.
Even
from
here,
Langdon
could
see
that
its
heavy
wooden
door
was
wide
open,
and
the
spacious
octagonal
interior
was
bathed
in
a
grayish
natural
light
from
the
room's
enormous
windows
that
looked
out
on
College
Garden.
Go
through
Chapter
House,
out
south
exit,
to
public
garden.
"We
just
left
the
east
cloister,"
Langdon
said,
"so
the
south
exit
to
the
garden
must
be
through
there
and
to
the
right."
Sophie
was
already
stepping
over
the
swag
and
moving
forward.
As
they
hurried
down
the
dark
corridor,
the
sounds
of
the
wind
and
rain
from
the
open
cloister
faded
behind
them.
The
Chapter
House
was
a
kind
of
satellite
structure
a
freestanding
annex
at
the
end
of
the
long
hallway
to
ensure
the
privacy
of
the
Parliament
proceedings
housed
there.
"It
looks
huge,"
Sophie
whispered
as
they
approached.
Langdon
had
forgotten
just
how
large
this
room
was.
Even
from
outside
the
entrance,
he
could
gaze
across
the
vast
expanse
of
floor
to
the
breathtaking
windows
on
the
far
side
of
the
octagon,
which
rose
five
stories
to
a
vaulted
ceiling.
They
would
certainly
have
a
clear
view
of
the
garden
from
in
here.
Crossing
the
threshold,
both
Langdon
and
Sophie
found
themselves
having
to
squint.
After
the
gloomy
cloisters,
the
Chapter
House
felt
like
a
solarium.
They
were
a
good
ten
feet
into
the
room,
searching
the
south
wall,
when
they
realized
the
door
they
had
been
promised
was
not
there.
They
were
standing
in
an
enormous
dead
end.
The
creaking
of
a
heavy
door
behind
them
made
them
turn,
just
as
the
door
closed
with
a
resounding
thud
and
the
latch
fell
into
place.
The
lone
man
who
had
been
standing
behind
the
door
looked
calm
as
he
aimed
a
small
revolver
at
them.
He
was
portly
and
was
propped
on
a
pair
of
aluminum
crutches.
For
a
moment
Langdon
thought
he
must
be
dreaming.
It
was
Leigh
Teabing.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
felt
rueful
as
he
gazed
out
over
the
barrel
of
his
Medusa
revolver
at
Robert
Langdon
and
Sophie
Neveu.
"My
friends,"
he
said,
"since
the
moment
you
walked
into
my
home
last
night,
I
have
done
everything
in
my
power
to
keep
you
out
of
harm's
way.
But
your
persistence
has
now
put
me
in
a
difficult
position."
He
could
see
the
expressions
of
shock
and
betrayal
on
Sophie's
and
Langdon's
faces,
and
yet
he
was
confident
that
soon
they
would
both
understand
the
chain
of
events
that
had
guided
the
three
of
them
to
this
unlikely
crossroads.
There
is
so
much
I
have
to
tell
you
both
so
much
you
do
not
yet
understand.
"Please
believe,"
Teabing
said,
"I
never
had
any
intention
of
your
being
involved.
You
came
to
my
home.
You
came
searching
for
me.
"Leigh?"
Langdon
finally
managed.
"What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
We
thought
you
were
in
trouble.
We
came
here
to
help
you!"
"As
I
trusted
you
would,"
he
said.
"We
have
much
to
discuss."
Langdon
and
Sophie
seemed
unable
to
tear
their
stunned
gazes
from
the
revolver
aimed
at
them.
"It
is
simply
to
ensure
your
full
attention,"
Teabing
said.
"If
I
had
wanted
to
harm
you,
you
would
be
dead
by
now.
When
you
walked
into
my
home
last
night,
I
risked
everything
to
spare
your
lives.
I
am
a
man
of
honor,
and
I
vowed
in
my
deepest
conscience
only
to
sacrifice
those
who
had
betrayed
the
Sangreal."
"What
are
you
talking
about?"
Langdon
said.
"Betrayed
the
Sangreal?"
"I
discovered
a
terrible
truth,"
Teabing
said,
sighing.
"I
learned
why
the
Sangreal
documents
were
never
revealed
to
the
world.
I
learned
that
the
Priory
had
decided
not
to
release
the
truth
after
all.
That's
why
the
millennium
passed
without
any
revelation,
why
nothing
happened
as
we
entered
the
End
of
Days."
Langdon
drew
a
breath,
about
to
protest.
"The
Priory,"
Teabing
continued,
"was
given
a
sacred
charge
to
share
the
truth.
To
release
the
Sangreal
documents
when
the
End
of
Days
arrived.
For
centuries,
men
like
Da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
and
Newton
risked
everything
to
protect
the
documents
and
carry
out
that
charge.
And
now,
at
the
ultimate
moment
of
truth,
Jacques
Sauniere
changed
his
mind.
The
man
honored
with
the
greatest
responsibility
in
Christian
history
eschewed
his
duty.
He
decided
the
time
was
not
right."
Teabing
turned
to
Sophie.
"He
failed
the
Grail.
He
failed
the
Priory.
And
he
failed
the
memory
of
all
the
generations
that
had
worked
to
make
that
moment
possible."
"You?"
Sophie
declared,
glancing
up
now,
her
green
eyes
boring
into
him
with
rage
and
realization.
"You
are
the
one
responsible
for
my
grandfather's
murder?"
Teabing
scoffed.
"Your
grandfather
and
his
senechaux
were
traitors
to
the
Grail."
Sophie
felt
a
fury
rising
from
deep
within.
He's
lying!
Teabing's
voice
was
relentless.
"Your
grandfather
sold
out
to
the
Church.
It
is
obvious
they
pressured
him
to
keep
the
truth
quiet."
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"The
Church
had
no
influence
on
my
grandfather!"
Teabing
laughed
coldly.
"My
dear,
the
Church
has
two
thousand
years
of
experience
pressuring
those
who
threaten
to
unveil
its
lies.
Since
the
days
of
Constantine,
the
Church
has
successfully
hidden
the
truth
about
Mary
Magdalene
and
Jesus.
We
should
not
be
surprised
that
now,
once
again,
they
have
found
a
way
to
keep
the
world
in
the
dark.
The
Church
may
no
longer
employ
crusaders
to
slaughter
non
believers,
but
their
influence
is
no
less
persuasive.
No
less
insidious."
He
paused,
as
if
to
punctuate
his
next
point.
"Miss
Neveu,
for
some
time
now
your
grandfather
has
wanted
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
family."
Sophie
was
stunned.
"How
could
you
know
that?"
"My
methods
are
immaterial.
The
important
thing
for
you
to
grasp
right
now
is
this."
He
took
a
deep
breath.
"The
deaths
of
your
mother,
father,
grandmother,
and
brother
were
not
accidental."
The
words
sent
Sophie's
emotions
reeling.
She
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
but
was
unable.
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"What
are
you
saying?"
"Robert,
it
explains
everything.
All
the
pieces
fit.
History
repeats
itself.
The
Church
has
a
precedent
of
murder
when
it
comes
to
silencing
the
Sangreal.
With
the
End
of
Days
imminent,
killing
the
Grand
Master's
loved
ones
sent
a
very
clear
message.
Be
quiet,
or
you
and
Sophie
are
next."
"It
was
a
car
accident,"
Sophie
stammered,
feeling
the
childhood
pain
welling
inside
her.
"An
accident!"
"Bedtime
stories
to
protect
your
innocence,"
Teabing
said.
"Consider
that
only
two
family
members
went
untouched
the
Priory's
Grand
Master
and
his
lone
granddaughter
the
perfect
pair
to
provide
the
Church
with
control
over
the
brotherhood.
I
can
only
imagine
the
terror
the
Church
wielded
over
your
grandfather
these
past
years,
threatening
to
kill
you
if
he
dared
release
the
Sangreal
secret,
threatening
to
finish
the
job
they
started
unless
Sauniere
influenced
the
Priory
to
reconsider
its
ancient
vow."
"Leigh,"
Langdon
argued,
now
visibly
riled,
"certainly
you
have
no
proof
that
the
Church
had
anything
to
do
with
those
deaths,
or
that
it
influenced
the
Priory's
decision
to
remain
silent."
"Proof?"
Teabing
fired
back.
"You
want
proof
the
Priory
was
influenced?
The
new
millennium
has
arrived,
and
yet
the
world
remains
ignorant!
Is
that
not
proof
enough?"
In
the
echoes
of
Teabing's
words,
Sophie
heard
another
voice
speaking.
Sophie,
I
must
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
family.
She
realized
she
was
trembling.
Could
this
possibly
be
that
truth
her
grandfather
had
wanted
to
tell
her?
That
her
family
had
been
murdered?
What
did
she
truly
know
about
the
crash
that
took
her
family?
Only
sketchy
details.
Even
the
stories
in
the
newspaper
had
been
vague.
An
accident?
Bedtime
stories?
Sophie
flashed
suddenly
on
her
grandfather's
overprotectiveness,
how
he
never
liked
to
leave
her
alone
when
she
was
young.
Even
when
Sophie
was
grown
and
away
at
university,
she
had
the
sense
her
grandfather
was
watching
over.
She
wondered
if
there
had
been
Priory
members
in
the
shadows
throughout
her
entire
life,
looking
after
her.
"You
suspected
he
was
being
manipulated,"
Langdon
said,
glaring
with
disbelief
at
Teabing.
"So
you
murdered
him?"
"I
did
not
pull
the
trigger,"
Teabing
said.
"Sauniere
was
dead
years
ago,
when
the
Church
stole
his
family
from
him.
He
was
compromised.
Now
he
is
free
of
that
pain,
released
from
the
shame
caused
by
his
inability
to
carry
out
his
sacred
duty.
Consider
the
alternative.
Something
had
to
be
done.
Shall
the
world
be
ignorant
forever?
Shall
the
Church
be
allowed
to
cement
its
lies
into
our
history
books
for
all
eternity?
Shall
the
Church
be
permitted
to
influence
indefinitely
with
murder
and
extortion?
No,
something
needed
to
be
done!
And
now
we
are
poised
to
carry
out
Sauniere's
legacy
and
right
a
terrible
wrong."
He
paused.
"The
three
of
us.
Together."
Sophie
felt
only
incredulity.
"How
could
you
possibly
believe
that
we
would
help
you?"
"Because,
my
dear,
you
are
the
reason
the
Priory
failed
to
release
the
documents.
Your
grandfather's
love
for
you
prevented
him
from
challenging
the
Church.
His
fear
of
reprisal
against
his
only
remaining
family
crippled
him.
He
never
had
a
chance
to
explain
the
truth
because
you
rejected
him,
tying
his
hands,
making
him
wait.
Now
you
owe
the
world
the
truth.
You
owe
it
to
the
memory
of
your
grandfather."
Robert
Langdon
had
given
up
trying
to
get
his
bearings.
Despite
the
torrent
of
questions
running
through
his
mind,
he
knew
only
one
thing
mattered
now
getting
Sophie
out
of
here
alive.
All
the
guilt
Langdon
had
mistakenly
felt
earlier
for
involving
Teabing
had
now
been
transferred
to
Sophie.
took
her
to
Chateau
Villette.
I
am
responsible.
Langdon
could
not
fathom
that
Leigh
Teabing
would
be
capable
of
killing
them
in
cold
blood
here
in
the
Chapter
House,
and
yet
Teabing
certainly
had
been
involved
in
killing
others
during
his
misguided
quest.
Langdon
had
the
uneasy
feeling
that
gunshots
in
this
secluded,
thick
walled
chamber
would
go
unheard,
especially
in
this
rain.
And
Leigh
just
admitted
his
guilt
to
us.
Langdon
glanced
at
Sophie,
who
looked
shaken.
The
Church
murdered
Sophie
's
family
to
silence
the
Priory?
Langdon
felt
certain
the
modern
Church
did
not
murder
people.
There
had
to
be
some
other
explanation.
"Let
Sophie
leave,"
Langdon
declared,
staring
at
Leigh.
"You
and
I
should
discuss
this
alone."
Teabing
gave
an
unnatural
laugh.
"I'm
afraid
that
is
one
show
of
faith
I
cannot
afford.
I
can,
however,
offer
you
this.
"
He
propped
himself
fully
on
his
crutches,
gracelessly
keeping
the
gun
aimed
at
Sophie,
and
removed
the
keystone
from
his
pocket.
He
swayed
a
bit
as
he
held
it
out
for
Langdon.
"A
token
of
trust,
Robert."
Robert
felt
wary
and
didn't
move.
Leigh
is
giving
the
keystone
back
to
us?
"Take
it,"
Teabing
said,
thrusting
it
awkwardly
toward
Langdon.
Langdon
could
imagine
only
one
reason
Teabing
would
give
it
back.
"You
opened
it
already.
You
removed
the
map."
Teabing
was
shaking
his
head.
"Robert,
if
I
had
solved
the
keystone,
I
would
have
disappeared
to
find
the
Grail
myself
and
kept
you
uninvolved.
No,
I
do
not
know
the
answer.
And
I
can
admit
that
freely.
A
true
knight
learns
humility
in
the
face
of
the
Grail.
He
learns
to
obey
the
signs
placed
before
him.
When
I
saw
you
enter
the
abbey,
I
understood.
You
were
here
for
a
reason.
To
help.
I
am
not
looking
for
singular
glory
here.
I
serve
a
far
greater
master
than
my
own
pride.
The
Truth.
Mankind
deserves
to
know
that
truth.
The
Grail
found
us
all,
and
now
she
is
begging
to
be
revealed.
We
must
work
together."
Despite
Teabing's
pleas
for
cooperation
and
trust,
his
gun
remained
trained
on
Sophie
as
Langdon
stepped
forward
and
accepted
the
cold
marble
cylinder.
The
vinegar
inside
gurgled
as
Langdon
grasped
it
and
stepped
backward.
The
dials
were
still
in
random
order,
and
the
cryptex
remained
locked.
Langdon
eyed
Teabing.
"How
do
you
know
I
won't
smash
it
right
now?"
Teabing's
laugh
was
an
eerie
chortle.
"I
should
have
realized
your
threat
to
break
it
in
the
Temple
Church
was
an
empty
one.
Robert
Langdon
would
never
break
the
keystone.
You
are
an
historian,
Robert.
You
are
holding
the
key
to
two
thousand
years
of
history
the
lost
key
to
the
Sangreal.
You
can
feel
the
souls
of
all
the
knights
burned
at
the
stake
to
protect
her
secret.
Would
you
have
them
die
in
vain?
No,
you
will
vindicate
them.
You
will
join
the
ranks
of
the
great
men
you
admire
Da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
Newton
each
of
whom
would
have
been
honored
to
be
in
your
shoes
right
now.
The
contents
of
the
keystone
are
crying
out
to
us.
Longing
to
be
set
free.
The
time
has
come.
Destiny
has
led
us
to
this
moment."
"I
cannot
help
you,
Leigh.
I
have
no
idea
how
to
open
this.
I
only
saw
Newton's
tomb
for
a
moment.
And
even
if
I
knew
the
password"
Langdon
paused,
realizing
he
had
said
too
much.
"You
would
not
tell
me?"
Teabing
sighed.
"I
am
disappointed
and
surprised,
Robert,
that
you
do
not
appreciate
the
extent
to
which
you
are
in
my
debt.
My
task
would
have
been
far
simpler
had
Remy
and
I
eliminated
you
both
when
you
walked
into
Chateau
Villette.
Instead
I
risked
everything
to
take
the
nobler
course."
"This
is
noble?"
Langdon
demanded,
eyeing
the
gun.
"Sauniere's
fault,"
Teabing
said.
"He
and
his
senechaux
lied
to
Silas.
Otherwise,
I
would
have
obtained
the
keystone
without
complication.
How
was
I
to
imagine
the
Grand
Master
would
go
to
such
ends
to
deceive
me
and
bequeath
the
keystone
to
an
estranged
granddaughter?"
Teabing
looked
at
Sophie
with
disdain.
"Someone
so
unqualified
to
hold
this
knowledge
that
she
required
a
symbologist
baby
sitter."
Teabing
glanced
back
at
Langdon.
"Fortunately,
Robert,
your
involvement
turned
out
to
be
my
saving
grace.
Rather
than
the
keystone
remaining
locked
in
the
depository
bank
forever,
you
extracted
it
and
walked
into
my
home."
Where
else
would
I
run?
Langdon
thought.
The
community
of
Grail
historians
is
small,
and
Teabing
and
I
have
a
history
together.
Teabing
now
looked
smug.
"When
I
learned
Sauniere
left
you
a
dying
message,
I
had
a
pretty
good
idea
you
were
holding
valuable
Priory
information.
Whether
it
was
the
keystone
itself,
or
information
on
where
to
find
it,
I
was
not
sure.
But
with
the
police
on
your
heels,
I
had
a
sneaking
suspicion
you
might
arrive
on
my
doorstep."
Langdon
glared.
"And
if
we
had
not?"
"I
was
formulating
a
plan
to
extend
you
a
helping
hand.
One
way
or
another,
the
keystone
was
coming
to
Chateau
Villette.
The
fact
that
you
delivered
it
into
my
waiting
hands
only
serves
as
proof
that
my
cause
is
just."
"What!"
Langdon
was
appalled.
"Silas
was
supposed
to
break
in
and
steal
the
keystone
from
you
in
Chateau
Villette
thus
removing
you
from
the
equation
without
hurting
you,
and
exonerating
me
from
any
suspicion
of
complicity.
However,
when
I
saw
the
intricacy
of
Sauniere's
codes,
I
decided
to
include
you
both
in
my
quest
a
bit
longer.
I
could
have
Silas
steal
the
keystone
later,
once
I
knew
enough
to
carry
on
alone."
"The
Temple
Church,"
Sophie
said,
her
tone
awash
with
betrayal.
Light
begins
to
dawn,
Teabing
thought.
The
Temple
Church
was
the
perfect
location
to
steal
the
keystone
from
Robert
and
Sophie,
and
its
apparent
relevance
to
the
poem
made
it
a
plausible
decoy.
Remy's
orders
had
been
clear
stay
out
of
sight
while
Silas
recovers
the
keystone.
Unfortunately,
Langdon's
threat
to
smash
the
keystone
on
the
chapel
floor
had
caused
Remy
to
panic.
If
only
Remy
had
not
revealed
himself,
Teabing
thought
ruefully,
recalling
his
own
mock
kidnapping.
Remy
was
the
sole
link
to
me,
and
he
showed
his
face!
Fortunately,
Silas
remained
unaware
of
Teabing's
true
identity
and
was
easily
fooled
into
taking
him
from
the
church
and
then
watching
naively
as
Remy
pretended
to
tie
their
hostage
in
the
back
of
the
limousine.
With
the
soundproof
divider
raised,
Teabing
was
able
to
phone
Silas
in
the
front
seat,
use
the
fake
French
accent
of
the
Teacher,
and
direct
Silas
to
go
straight
to
Opus
Dei.
A
simple
anonymous
tip
to
the
police
was
all
it
would
take
to
remove
Silas
from
the
picture.
One
loose
end
tied
up.
The
other
loose
end
was
harder.
Remy.
Teabing
struggled
deeply
with
the
decision,
but
in
the
end
Remy
had
proven
himself
a
liability.
Every
Grail
quest
requires
sacrifice.
The
cleanest
solution
had
been
staring
Teabing
in
the
face
from
the
limousine's
wet
bar
a
flask,
some
cognac,
and
a
can
of
peanuts.
The
powder
at
the
bottom
of
the
can
would
be
more
than
enough
to
trigger
Remy's
deadly
allergy.
When
Remy
parked
the
limo
on
Horse
Guards
Parade,
Teabing
climbed
out
of
the
back,
walked
to
the
side
passenger
door,
and
sat
in
the
front
next
to
Remy.
Minutes
later,
Teabing
got
out
of
the
car,
climbed
into
the
rear
again,
cleaned
up
the
evidence,
and
finally
emerged
to
carry
out
the
final
phase
of
his
mission.
Westminster
Abbey
had
been
a
short
walk,
and
although
Teabing's
leg
braces,
crutches,
and
gun
had
set
off
the
metal
detector,
the
rent
a
cops
never
knew
what
to
do.
Do
we
ask
him
to
remove
his
braces
and
crawl
through?
Do
we
frisk
his
deformed
body?
Teabing
presented
the
flustered
guards
a
far
easier
solution
an
embossed
card
identifying
him
as
Knight
of
the
Realm.
The
poor
fellows
practically
tripped
over
one
another
ushering
him
in.
Now,
eyeing
the
bewildered
Langdon
and
Neveu,
Teabing
resisted
the
urge
to
reveal
how
he
had
brilliantly
implicated
Opus
Dei
in
the
plot
that
would
soon
bring
about
the
demise
of
the
entire
Church.
That
would
have
to
wait.
Right
now
there
was
work
to
do.
"Mes
amis,
"
Teabing
declared
in
flawless
French,
"vous
ne
trouvezpas
le
Saint
Graal,
c'est
le
Saint
Graal
qui
vous
trouve.
"
He
smiled.
"Our
paths
together
could
not
be
more
clear.
The
Grail
has
found
us."
Silence.
He
spoke
to
them
in
a
whisper
now.
"Listen.
Can
you
hear
it?
The
Grail
is
speaking
to
us
across
the
centuries.
She
is
begging
to
be
saved
from
the
Priory's
folly.
I
implore
you
both
to
recognize
this
opportunity.
There
could
not
possibly
be
three
more
capable
people
assembled
at
this
moment
to
break
the
final
code
and
open
the
cryptex."
Teabing
paused,
his
eyes
alight.
"We
need
to
swear
an
oath
together.
A
pledge
of
faith
to
one
another.
A
knight's
allegiance
to
uncover
the
truth
and
make
it
known."
Sophie
stared
deep
into
Teabing's
eyes
and
spoke
in
a
steely
tone.
"I
will
never
swear
an
oath
with
my
grandfather's
murderer.
Except
an
oath
that
I
will
see
you
go
to
prison."
Teabing's
heart
turned
grave,
then
resolute.
"I
am
sorry
you
feel
that
way,
mademoiselle."
He
turned
and
aimed
the
gun
at
Langdon.
"And
you,
Robert?
Are
you
with
me,
or
against
me?"
Bishop
Manuel
Aringarosa's
body
had
endured
many
kinds
of
pain,
and
yet
the
searing
heat
of
the
bullet
wound
in
his
chest
felt
profoundly
foreign
to
him.
Deep
and
grave.
Not
a
wound
of
the
flesh
but
closer
to
the
soul.
He
opened
his
eyes,
trying
to
see,
but
the
rain
on
his
face
blurred
his
vision.
Where
am
I?
He
could
feel
powerful
arms
holding
him,
carrying
his
limp
body
like
a
rag
doll,
his
black
cassock
flapping.
Lifting
a
weary
arm,
he
mopped
his
eyes
and
saw
the
man
holding
him
was
Silas.
The
great
albino
was
struggling
down
a
misty
sidewalk,
shouting
for
a
hospital,
his
voice
a
heartrending
wail
of
agony.
His
red
eyes
were
focused
dead
ahead,
tears
streaming
down
his
pale,
bloodspattered
face.
"My
son,"
Aringarosa
whispered,
"you're
hurt."
Silas
glanced
down,
his
visage
contorted
in
anguish.
"I
am
so
very
sorry,
Father."
He
seemed
almost
too
pained
to
speak.
"No,
Silas,"
Aringarosa
replied.
"It
is
I
who
am
sorry.
This
is
my
fault."
The
Teacher
promised
me
there
would
be
no
killing,
and
I
told
you
to
obey
him
fully.
"I
was
too
eager.
Too
fearful.
You
and
I
were
deceived."
The
Teacher
was
never
going
to
deliver
us
the
Holy
Grail.
Cradled
in
the
arms
of
the
man
he
had
taken
in
all
those
years
ago,
Bishop
Aringarosa
felt
himself
reel
back
in
time.
To
Spain.
To
his
modest
beginnings,
building
a
small
Catholic
church
in
Oviedo
with
Silas.
And
later,
to
New
York
City,
where
he
had
proclaimed
the
glory
of
God
with
the
towering
Opus
Dei
Center
on
Lexington
Avenue.
Five
months
ago,
Aringarosa
had
received
devastating
news.
His
life's
work
was
in
jeopardy.
He
recalled,
with
vivid
detail,
the
meeting
inside
Castel
Gandolfo
that
had
changed
his
life
the
news
that
had
set
this
entire
calamity
into
motion.
Aringarosa
had
entered
Gandolfo's
Astronomy
Library
with
his
head
held
high,
fully
expecting
to
be
lauded
by
throngs
of
welcoming
hands,
all
eager
to
pat
him
on
the
back
for
his
superior
work
representing
Catholicism
in
America.
But
only
three
people
were
present.
The
Vatican
secretariat.
Obese.
Dour.
Two
high
ranking
Italian
cardinals.
Sanctimonious.
Smug.
"Secretariat?"
Aringarosa
said,
puzzled.
The
rotund
overseer
of
legal
affairs
shook
Aringarosa's
hand
and
motioned
to
the
chair
opposite
him.
"Please,
make
yourself
comfortable."
Aringarosa
sat,
sensing
something
was
wrong.
"I
am
not
skilled
in
small
talk,
Bishop,"
the
secretariat
said,
"so
let
me
be
direct
about
the
reason
for
your
visit."
"Please.
Speak
openly."
Aringarosa
glanced
at
the
two
cardinals,
who
seemed
to
be
measuring
him
with
self
righteous
anticipation.
"As
you
are
well
aware,"
the
secretariat
said,
"His
Holiness
and
others
in
Rome
have
been
concerned
lately
with
the
political
fallout
from
Opus
Dei's
more
controversial
practices."
Aringarosa
felt
himself
bristle
instantly.
He
already
had
been
through
this
on
numerous
occasions
with
the
new
pontiff,
who,
to
Aringarosa's
great
dismay,
had
turned
out
to
be
a
distressingly
fervent
voice
for
liberal
change
in
the
Church.
"I
want
to
assure
you,"
the
secretariat
added
quickly,
"that
His
Holiness
does
not
seek
to
change
anything
about
the
way
you
run
your
ministry.
should
hope
not!
"Then
why
am
I
here?"
The
enormous
man
sighed.
"Bishop,
I
am
not
sure
how
to
say
this
delicately,
so
I
will
state
it
directly.
Two
days
ago,
the
Secretariat
Council
voted
unanimously
to
revoke
the
Vatican's
sanction
of
Opus
Dei."
Aringarosa
was
certain
he
had
heard
incorrectly.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"Plainly
stated,
six
months
from
today,
Opus
Dei
will
no
longer
be
considered
a
prelature
of
the
Vatican.
You
will
be
a
church
unto
yourself.
The
Holy
See
will
be
disassociating
itself
from
you.
His
Holiness
agrees
and
we
are
already
drawing
up
the
legal
papers."
"But
that
is
impossible!"
"On
the
contrary,
it
is
quite
possible.
And
necessary.
His
Holiness
has
become
uneasy
with
your
aggressive
recruiting
policies
and
your
practices
of
corporal
mortification."
He
paused.
"Also
your
policies
regarding
women.
Quite
frankly,
Opus
Dei
has
become
a
liability
and
an
embarrassment."
Bishop
Aringarosa
was
stupefied.
"An
embarrassment?"
"Certainly
you
cannot
be
surprised
it
has
come
to
this."
"Opus
Dei
is
the
only
Catholic
organization
whose
numbers
are
growing!
We
now
have
over
eleven
hundred
priests
!
"True.
A
troubling
issue
for
us
all."
Aringarosa
shot
to
his
feet.
"Ask
His
Holiness
if
Opus
Dei
was
an
embarrassment
in
1982
when
we
helped
the
Vatican
Bank!"
"The
Vatican
will
always
be
grateful
for
that,"
the
secretariat
said,
his
tone
appeasing,
"and
yet
there
are
those
who
still
believe
your
financial
munificence
in
1982
is
the
only
reason
you
were
granted
prelature
status
in
the
first
place."
"That
is
not
true!"
The
insinuation
offended
Aringarosa
deeply.
"Whatever
the
case,
we
plan
to
act
in
good
faith.
We
are
drawing
up
severance
terms
that
will
include
a
reimbursement
of
those
monies.
It
will
be
paid
in
five
installments."
"You
are
buying
me
off?"
Aringarosa
demanded.
"Paying
me
to
go
quietly?
When
Opus
Dei
is
the
only
remaining
voice
of
reason!"
One
of
the
cardinals
glanced
up.
"I'm
sorry,
did
you
say
reason?"
Aringarosa
leaned
across
the
table,
sharpening
his
tone
to
a
point.
"Do
you
really
wonder
why
Catholics
are
leaving
the
Church?
Look
around
you,
Cardinal.
People
have
lost
respect.
The
rigors
of
faith
are
gone.
The
doctrine
has
become
a
buffet
line.
Abstinence,
confession,
communion,
baptism,
mass
take
your
pick
choose
whatever
combination
pleases
you
and
ignore
the
rest.
What
kind
of
spiritual
guidance
is
the
Church
offering?"
"Third
century
laws,"
the
second
cardinal
said,
"cannot
be
applied
to
the
modern
followers
of
Christ.
The
rules
are
not
workable
in
today's
society."
"Well,
they
seem
to
be
working
for
Opus
Dei!"
"Bishop
Aringarosa,"
the
secretariat
said,
his
voice
conclusive.
"Out
of
respect
for
your
organization's
relationship
with
the
previous
Pope,
His
Holiness
will
be
giving
Opus
Dei
six
months
to
voluntarily
break
away
from
the
Vatican.
I
suggest
you
cite
your
differences
of
opinion
with
the
Holy
See
and
establish
yourself
as
your
own
Christian
organization."
"I
refuse!"
Aringarosa
declared.
"And
I'll
tell
him
that
in
person!"
"I'm
afraid
His
Holiness
no
longer
cares
to
meet
with
you."
Aringarosa
stood
up.
"He
would
not
dare
abolish
a
personal
prelature
established
by
a
previous
Pope!"
"I'm
sorry."
The
secretariat's
eyes
did
not
flinch.
"The
Lord
giveth
and
the
Lord
taketh
away."
Aringarosa
had
staggered
from
that
meeting
in
bewilderment
and
panic.
Returning
to
New
York,
he
stared
out
at
the
skyline
in
disillusionment
for
days,
overwhelmed
with
sadness
for
the
future
of
Christianity.
It
was
several
weeks
later
that
he
received
the
phone
call
that
changed
all
that.
The
caller
sounded
French
and
identified
himself
as
the
Teacher
a
title
common
in
the
prelature.
He
said
he
knew
of
the
Vatican's
plans
to
pull
support
from
Opus
Dei.
How
could
he
know
that?
Aringarosa
wondered.
He
had
hoped
only
a
handful
of
Vatican
power
brokers
knew
of
Opus
Dei's
impending
annulment.
Apparently
the
word
was
out.
When
it
came
to
containing
gossip,
no
walls
in
the
world
were
as
porous
as
those
surrounding
Vatican
City.
"I
have
ears
everywhere,
Bishop,"
the
Teacher
whispered,
"and
with
these
ears
I
have
gained
certain
knowledge.
With
your
help,
I
can
uncover
the
hiding
place
of
a
sacred
relic
that
will
bring
you
enormous
power
enough
power
to
make
the
Vatican
bow
before
you.
Enough
power
to
save
the
Faith."
He
paused.
"Not
just
for
Opus
Dei.
But
for
all
of
us."
The
Lord
taketh
away
and
the
Lord
giveth.
Aringarosa
felt
a
glorious
ray
of
hope.
"Tell
me
your
plan."
Bishop
Aringarosa
was
unconscious
when
the
doors
of
St.
Mary's
Hospital
hissed
open.
Silas
lurched
into
the
entryway
delirious
with
exhaustion.
Dropping
to
his
knees
on
the
tile
floor,
he
cried
out
for
help.
Everyone
in
the
reception
area
gaped
in
wonderment
at
the
half
naked
albino
offering
forth
a
bleeding
clergyman.
The
doctor
who
helped
Silas
heave
the
delirious
bishop
onto
a
gurney
looked
gloomy
as
he
felt
Aringarosa's
pulse.
"He's
lost
a
lot
of
blood.
I
am
not
hopeful."
Aringarosa's
eyes
flickered,
and
he
returned
for
a
moment,
his
gaze
locating
Silas.
"My
child"
Silas's
soul
thundered
with
remorse
and
rage.
"Father,
if
it
takes
my
lifetime,
I
will
find
the
one
who
deceived
us,
and
I
will
kill
him."
Aringarosa
shook
his
head,
looking
sad
as
they
prepared
to
wheel
him
away.
"Silas
if
you
have
learned
nothing
from
me,
please
learn
this."
He
took
Silas's
hand
and
gave
it
a
firm
squeeze.
"Forgiveness
is
God's
greatest
gift."
"But
Father"
Aringarosa
closed
his
eyes.
"Silas,
you
must
pray."
Robert
Langdon
stood
beneath
the
lofty
cupola
of
the
deserted
Chapter
House
and
stared
into
the
barrel
of
Leigh
Teabing's
gun.
Robert,
are
you
with
me,
or
against
me?
The
Royal
Historian's
words
echoed
in
the
silence
of
Langdon's
mind.
There
was
no
viable
response,
Langdon
knew.
Answer
yes,
and
he
would
be
selling
out
Sophie.
Answer
no,
and
Teabing
would
have
no
choice
but
to
kill
them
both.
Langdon's
years
in
the
classroom
had
not
imbued
him
with
any
skills
relevant
to
handling
confrontations
at
gunpoint,
but
the
classroom
had
taught
him
something
about
answering
paradoxical
questions.
When
a
question
has
no
correct
answer,
there
is
only
one
honest
response.
The
gray
area
between
yes
and
no.
Silence.
Staring
at
the
cryptex
in
his
hands,
Langdon
chose
simply
to
walk
away.
Without
ever
lifting
his
eyes,
he
stepped
backward,
out
into
the
room's
vast
empty
spaces.
Neutral
ground.
He
hoped
his
focus
on
the
cryptex
signaled
Teabing
that
collaboration
might
be
an
option,
and
that
his
silence
signaled
Sophie
he
had
not
abandoned
her.
All
the
while
buying
time
to
think.
The
act
of
thinking,
Langdon
suspected,
was
exactly
what
Teabing
wanted
him
to
do.
That's
why
he
handed
me
the
cryptex.
So
I
could
feel
the
weight
of
my
decision.
The
British
historian
hoped
the
touch
of
the
Grand
Master's
cryptex
would
make
Langdon
fully
grasp
the
magnitude
of
its
contents,
coaxing
his
academic
curiosity
to
overwhelm
all
else,
forcing
him
to
realize
that
failure
to
unlock
the
keystone
would
mean
the
loss
of
history
itself.
With
Sophie
at
gunpoint
across
the
room,
Langdon
feared
that
discovering
the
cryptex's
elusive
password
would
be
his
only
remaining
hope
of
bartering
her
release.
If
I
can
free
the
map,
Teabing
will
negotiate.
Forcing
his
mind
to
this
critical
task,
Langdon
moved
slowly
toward
the
far
windows
allowing
his
mind
to
fill
with
the
numerous
astronomical
images
on
Newton's
tomb.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
Turning
his
back
to
the
others,
he
walked
toward
the
towering
windows,
searching
for
any
inspiration
in
their
stained
glass
mosaics.
There
was
none.
Place
yourself
in
Sauniere's
mind,
he
urged,
gazing
outward
now
into
College
Garden.
What
would
he
believe
is
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
Newton's
tomb?
Images
of
stars,
comets,
and
planets
twinkled
in
the
falling
rain,
but
Langdon
ignored
them.
Sauniere
was
not
a
man
of
science.
He
was
a
man
of
humanity,
of
art,
of
history.
The
sacred
feminine
the
chalice
the
Rose
the
banished
Mary
Magdalene
the
decline
of
the
goddess
the
Holy
Grail.
Legend
had
always
portrayed
the
Grail
as
a
cruel
mistress,
dancing
in
the
shadows
just
out
of
sight,
whispering
in
your
ear,
luring
you
one
more
step
and
then
evaporating
into
the
mist.
Gazing
out
at
the
rustling
trees
of
College
Garden,
Langdon
sensed
her
playful
presence.
The
signs
were
everywhere.
Like
a
taunting
silhouette
emerging
from
the
fog,
the
branches
of
Britain's
oldest
apple
tree
burgeoned
with
five
petaled
blossoms,
all
glistening
like
Venus.
The
goddess
was
in
the
garden
now.
She
was
dancing
in
the
rain,
singing
songs
of
the
ages,
peeking
out
from
behind
the
bud
filled
branches
as
if
to
remind
Langdon
that
the
fruit
of
knowledge
was
growing
just
beyond
his
reach.
Across
the
room,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
watched
with
confidence
as
Langdon
gazed
out
the
window
as
if
under
a
spell.
Exactly
as
I
hoped,
Teabing
thought.
He
will
come
around.
For
some
time
now,
Teabing
had
suspected
Langdon
might
hold
the
key
to
the
Grail.
It
was
no
coincidence
that
Teabing
launched
his
plan
into
action
on
the
same
night
Langdon
was
scheduled
to
meet
Jacques
Sauniere.
Listening
in
on
the
curator,
Teabing
was
certain
the
man's
eagerness
to
meet
privately
with
Langdon
could
mean
only
one
thing.
Langdon'
s
mysterious
manuscript
has
touched
a
nerve
with
the
Priory.
Langdon
has
stumbled
onto
a
truth,
and
Sauniere
fears
its
release.
Teabing
felt
certain
the
Grand
Master
was
summoning
Langdon
to
silence
him.
The
Truth
has
been
silenced
long
enough!
Teabing
knew
he
had
to
act
quickly.
Silas's
attack
would
accomplish
two
goals.
It
would
prevent
Sauniere
from
persuading
Langdon
to
keep
quiet,
and
it
would
ensure
that
once
the
keystone
was
in
Teabing's
hands,
Langdon
would
be
in
Paris
for
recruitment
should
Teabing
need
him.
Arranging
the
fatal
meeting
between
Sauniere
and
Silas
had
been
almost
too
easy.
had
inside
information
about
Sauniere
's
deepest
fears.
Yesterday
afternoon,
Silas
had
phoned
the
curator
and
posed
as
a
distraught
priest.
"Monsieur
Sauniere,
forgive
me,
I
must
speak
to
you
at
once.
I
should
never
breach
the
sanctity
of
the
confessional,
but
in
this
case,
I
feel
I
must.
I
just
took
confession
from
a
man
who
claimed
to
have
murdered
members
of
your
family.
Sauniere's
response
was
startled
but
wary.
"My
family
died
in
an
accident.
The
police
report
was
conclusive."
"Yes,
a
car
accident,"
Silas
said,
baiting
the
hook.
"The
man
I
spoke
to
said
he
forced
their
car
off
the
road
into
a
river.
Sauniere
fell
silent.
"Monsieur
Sauniere,
I
would
never
have
phoned
you
directly
except
this
man
made
a
comment
which
makes
me
now
fear
for
your
safety."
He
paused.
"The
man
also
mentioned
your
granddaughter,
Sophie."
The
mention
of
Sophie's
name
had
been
the
catalyst.
The
curator
leapt
into
action.
He
ordered
Silas
to
come
see
him
immediately
in
the
safest
location
Sauniere
knew
his
Louvre
office.
Then
he
phoned
Sophie
to
warn
her
she
might
be
in
danger.
Drinks
with
Robert
Langdon
were
instantly
abandoned.
Now,
with
Langdon
separated
from
Sophie
on
the
far
side
of
the
room,
Teabing
sensed
he
had
successfully
alienated
the
two
companions
from
one
another.
Sophie
Neveu
remained
defiant,
but
Langdon
clearly
saw
the
larger
picture.
He
was
trying
to
figure
out
the
password.
He
understands
the
importance
of
finding
the
Grail
and
releasing
her
from
bondage.
"He
won't
open
it
for
you,"
Sophie
said
coldly.
"Even
if
he
can."
Teabing
was
glancing
at
Langdon
as
he
held
the
gun
on
Sophie.
He
was
fairly
certain
now
he
was
going
to
have
to
use
the
weapon.
Although
the
idea
troubled
him,
he
knew
he
would
not
hesitate
if
it
came
to
that.
have
given
her
every
opportunity
to
do
the
right
thing.
The
Grail
is
bigger
than
any
one
of
us.
At
that
moment,
Langdon
turned
from
the
window.
"The
tomb"
he
said
suddenly,
facing
them
with
a
faint
glimmer
of
hope
in
his
eyes.
"I
know
where
to
look
on
Newton's
tomb.
Yes,
I
think
I
can
find
the
password!"
Teabing's
heart
soared.
"Where,
Robert?
Tell
me!"
Sophie
sounded
horrified.
"Robert,
no!
You're
not
going
to
help
him,
are
you?"
Langdon
approached
with
a
resolute
stride,
holding
the
cryptex
before
him.
"No,"
he
said,
his
eyes
hardening
as
he
turned
to
Leigh.
"Not
until
he
lets
you
go."
Teabing's
optimism
darkened.
"We
are
so
close,
Robert.
Don't
you
dare
start
playing
games
with
me!"
"No
games,"
Langdon
said.
"Let
her
go.
Then
I'll
take
you
to
Newton's
tomb.
We'll
open
the
cryptex
together."
"I'm
not
going
anywhere,"
Sophie
declared,
her
eyes
narrowing
with
rage.
"That
cryptex
was
given
to
me
by
my
grandfather.
It
is
not
yours
to
open."
Langdon
wheeled,
looking
fearful.
"Sophie,
please!
You're
in
danger.
I'm
trying
to
help
you!"
"How?
By
unveiling
the
secret
my
grandfather
died
trying
to
protect?
He
trusted
you,
Robert.
trusted
you!"
Langdon's
blue
eyes
showed
panic
now,
and
Teabing
could
not
help
but
smile
to
see
the
two
of
them
working
against
one
another.
Langdon's
attempts
to
be
gallant
were
more
pathetic
than
anything.
On
the
verge
of
unveiling
one
of
history's
greatest
secrets,
and
he
troubles
himself
with
a
woman
who
has
proven
herself
unworthy
of
the
quest.
"Sophie,"
Langdon
pleaded.
"Please
you
must
leave."
She
shook
her
head.
"Not
unless
you
either
hand
me
the
cryptex
or
smash
it
on
the
floor."
"What?"
Langdon
gasped.
"Robert,
my
grandfather
would
prefer
his
secret
lost
forever
than
see
it
in
the
hands
of
his
murderer."
Sophie's
eyes
looked
as
if
they
would
well
with
tears,
but
they
did
not.
She
stared
directly
back
at
Teabing.
"Shoot
me
if
you
have
to.
I
am
not
leaving
my
grandfather's
legacy
in
your
hands."
Very
well.
Teabing
aimed
the
weapon.
"No!"
Langdon
shouted,
raising
his
arm
and
suspending
the
cryptex
precariously
over
the
hard
stone
floor.
"Leigh,
if
you
even
think
about
it,
I
will
drop
this."
Teabing
laughed.
"That
bluff
worked
on
Remy.
Not
on
me.
I
know
you
better
than
that."
"Do
you,
Leigh?"
Yes
I
do.
Your
poker
face
needs
work,
my
friend.
It
took
me
several
seconds,
but
I
can
see
now
that
you
are
lying.
You
have
no
idea
where
on
Newton
's
tomb
the
answer
lies.
"Truly,
Robert?
You
know
where
on
the
tomb
to
look?"
"Ida"
The
falter
in
Langdon's
eyes
was
fleeting
but
Leigh
caught
it.
There
was
a
lie
there.
A
desperate,
pathetic
ploy
to
save
Sophie.
Teabing
felt
a
profound
disappointment
in
Robert
Langdon.
am
a
lone
knight,
surrounded
by
unworthy
souls.
And
I
will
have
to
decipher
the
keystone
on
my
own.
Langdon
and
Neveu
were
nothing
but
a
threat
to
Teabing
now
and
to
the
Grail.
As
painful
as
the
solution
was
going
to
be,
he
knew
he
could
carry
it
out
with
a
clean
conscience.
The
only
challenge
would
be
to
persuade
Langdon
to
set
down
the
keystone
so
Teabing
could
safely
end
this
charade.
"A
show
of
faith,"
Teabing
said,
lowering
the
gun
from
Sophie.
"Set
down
the
keystone,
and
we'll
talk."
Langdon
knew
his
lie
had
failed.
He
could
see
the
dark
resolve
in
Teabing's
face
and
knew
the
moment
was
upon
them.
When
I
set
this
down,
he
will
kill
us
both.
Even
without
looking
at
Sophie,
he
could
hear
her
heart
beseeching
him
in
silent
desperation.
Robert,
this
man
is
not
worthy
of
the
Grail.
Please
do
not
place
it
in
his
hands.
No
matter
what
the
cost.
Langdon
had
already
made
his
decision
several
minutes
ago,
while
standing
alone
at
the
window
overlooking
College
Garden.
Protect
Sophie.
Protect
the
Grail.
Langdon
had
almost
shouted
out
in
desperation.
But
I
cannot
see
how!
The
stark
moments
of
disillusionment
had
brought
with
them
a
clarity
unlike
any
he
had
ever
felt.
The
Truth
is
right
before
your
eyes,
Robert.
He
knew
not
from
where
the
epiphany
came.
The
Grail
is
not
mocking
you,
she
is
calling
out
to
a
worthy
soul.
Now,
bowing
down
like
a
subject
several
yards
in
front
of
Leigh
Teabing,
Langdon
lowered
the
cryptex
to
within
inches
of
the
stone
floor.
"Yes,
Robert,"
Teabing
whispered,
aiming
the
gun
at
him.
"Set
it
down."
Langdon's
eyes
moved
heavenward,
up
into
the
gaping
void
of
the
Chapter
House
cupola.
Crouching
lower,
Langdon
lowered
his
gaze
to
Teabing's
gun,
aimed
directly
at
him.
"I'm
sorry,
Leigh."
In
one
fluid
motion,
Langdon
leapt
up,
swinging
his
arm
skyward,
launching
the
cryptex
straight
up
toward
the
dome
above.
Leigh
Teabing
did
not
feel
his
finger
pull
the
trigger,
but
the
Medusa
discharged
with
a
thundering
crash.
Langdon's
crouched
form
was
now
vertical,
almost
airborne,
and
the
bullet
exploded
in
the
floor
near
Langdon's
feet.
Half
of
Teabing's
brain
attempted
to
adjust
his
aim
and
fire
again
in
rage,
but
the
more
powerful
half
dragged
his
eyes
upward
into
the
cupola.
The
keystone!
Time
seemed
to
freeze,
morphing
into
a
slow
motion
dream
as
Teabing's
entire
world
became
the
airborne
keystone.
He
watched
it
rise
to
the
apex
of
its
climb
hovering
for
a
moment
in
the
void
and
then
tumbling
downward,
end
over
end,
back
toward
the
stone
floor.
All
of
Teabing's
hopes
and
dreams
were
plummeting
toward
earth.
It
cannot
strike
the
floor!
I
can
reach
it!
Teabing's
body
reacted
on
instinct.
He
released
the
gun
and
heaved
himself
forward,
dropping
his
crutches
as
he
reached
out
with
his
soft,
manicured
hands.
Stretching
his
arms
and
fingers,
he
snatched
the
keystone
from
midair.
Falling
forward
with
the
keystone
victoriously
clutched
in
his
hand,
Teabing
knew
he
was
falling
too
fast.
With
nothing
to
break
his
fall,
his
outstretched
arms
hit
first,
and
the
cryptex
collided
hard
with
the
floor.
There
was
a
sickening
crunch
of
glass
within.
For
a
full
second,
Teabing
did
not
breathe.
Lying
there
outstretched
on
the
cold
floor,
staring
the
length
of
his
outstretched
arms
at
the
marble
cylinder
in
his
bare
palms,
he
implored
the
glass
vial
inside
to
hold.
Then
the
acrid
tang
of
vinegar
cut
the
air,
and
Teabing
felt
the
cool
liquid
flowing
out
through
the
dials
onto
his
palm.
Wild
panic
gripped
him.
NO!
The
vinegar
was
streaming
now,
and
Teabing
pictured
the
papyrus
dissolving
within.
Robert,
you
fool!
The
secret
is
lost!
Teabing
felt
himself
sobbing
uncontrollably.
The
Grail
is
gone.
Everything
destroyed.
Shuddering
in
disbelief
over
Langdon's
actions,
Teabing
tried
to
force
the
cylinder
apart,
longing
to
catch
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
history
before
it
dissolved
forever.
To
his
shock,
as
he
pulled
the
ends
of
the
keystone,
the
cylinder
separated.
He
gasped
and
peered
inside.
It
was
empty
except
for
shards
of
wet
glass.
No
dissolving
papyrus.
Teabing
rolled
over
and
looked
up
at
Langdon.
Sophie
stood
beside
him,
aiming
the
gun
down
at
Teabing.
Bewildered,
Teabing
looked
back
at
the
keystone
and
saw
it.
The
dials
were
no
longer
at
random.
They
spelled
a
five
letter
word:
APPLE.
"The
orb
from
which
Eve
partook,"
Langdon
said
coolly,
"incurring
the
Holy
wrath
of
God.
Original
sin.
The
symbol
of
the
fall
of
the
sacred
feminine."
Teabing
felt
the
truth
come
crashing
down
on
him
in
excruciating
austerity.
The
orb
that
ought
be
on
Newton's
tomb
could
be
none
other
than
the
Rosy
apple
that
fell
from
heaven,
struck
Newton
on
the
head,
and
inspired
his
life's
work.
His
labor's
fruit!
The
Rosy
flesh
with
a
seeded
womb!
"Robert,"
Teabing
stammered,
overwhelmed.
"You
opened
it.
Where
is
the
map?"
Without
blinking,
Langdon
reached
into
the
breast
pocket
of
his
tweed
coat
and
carefully
extracted
a
delicate
rolled
papyrus.
Only
a
few
yards
from
where
Teabing
lay,
Langdon
unrolled
the
scroll
and
looked
at
it.
After
a
long
moment,
a
knowing
smile
crossed
Langdon's
face.
He
knows!
Teabing's
heart
craved
that
knowledge.
His
life's
dream
was
right
in
front
of
him.
"Tell
me!"
Teabing
demanded.
"Please!
Oh
God,
please!
It's
not
too
late!"
As
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
thundered
down
the
hall
toward
the
Chapter
House,
Langdon
quietly
rolled
the
papyrus
and
slipped
it
back
in
his
pocket.
"No!"
Teabing
cried
out,
trying
in
vain
to
stand.
When
the
doors
burst
open,
Bezu
Fache
entered
like
a
bull
into
a
ring,
his
feral
eyes
scanning,
finding
his
target
Leigh
Teabing
helpless
on
the
floor.
Exhaling
in
relief,
Fache
holstered
his
Manurhin
sidearm
and
turned
to
Sophie.
"Agent
Neveu,
I
am
relieved
you
and
Mr.
Langdon
are
safe.
You
should
have
come
in
when
I
asked."
The
British
police
entered
on
Fache's
heels,
seizing
the
anguished
prisoner
and
placing
him
in
handcuffs.
Sophie
seemed
stunned
to
see
Fache.
"How
did
you
find
us?"
Fache
pointed
to
Teabing.
"He
made
the
mistake
of
showing
his
ID
when
he
entered
the
abbey.
The
guards
heard
a
police
broadcast
about
our
search
for
him."
"It's
in
Langdon's
pocket!"
Teabing
was
screaming
like
a
madman.
"The
map
to
the
Holy
Grail!"
As
they
hoisted
Teabing
and
carried
him
out,
he
threw
back
his
head
and
howled.
"Robert!
Tell
me
where
it's
hidden!"
As
Teabing
passed,
Langdon
looked
him
in
the
eye.
"Only
the
worthy
find
the
Grail,
Leigh.
You
taught
me
that.
The
mist
had
settled
low
on
Kensington
Gardens
as
Silas
limped
into
a
quiet
hollow
out
of
sight.
Kneeling
on
the
wet
grass,
he
could
feel
a
warm
stream
of
blood
flowing
from
the
bullet
wound
below
his
ribs.
Still,
he
stared
straight
ahead.
The
fog
made
it
look
like
heaven
here.
Raising
his
bloody
hands
to
pray,
he
watched
the
raindrops
caress
his
fingers,
turning
them
white
again.
As
the
droplets
fell
harder
across
his
back
and
shoulders,
he
could
feel
his
body
disappearing
bit
by
bit
into
the
mist.
am
a
ghost.
A
breeze
rustled
past
him,
carrying
the
damp,
earthy
scent
of
new
life.
With
every
living
cell
in
his
broken
body,
Silas
prayed.
He
prayed
for
forgiveness.
He
prayed
for
mercy.
And,
above
all,
he
prayed
for
his
mentor
Bishop
Aringarosa
that
the
Lord
would
not
take
him
before
his
time.
He
has
so
much
work
left
to
do.
The
fog
was
swirling
around
him
now,
and
Silas
felt
so
light
that
he
was
sure
the
wisps
would
carry
him
away.
Closing
his
eyes,
he
said
a
final
prayer.
From
somewhere
in
the
mist,
the
voice
of
Manuel
Aringarosa
whispered
to
him.
Our
Lord
is
a
good
and
merciful
God.
Silas's
pain
at
last
began
to
fade,
and
he
knew
the
bishop
was
right.
It
was
late
afternoon
when
the
London
sun
broke
through
and
the
city
began
to
dry.
Bezu
Fache
felt
weary
as
he
emerged
from
the
interrogation
room
and
hailed
a
cab.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
had
vociferously
proclaimed
his
innocence,
and
yet
from
his
incoherent
rantings
about
the
Holy
Grail,
secret
documents,
and
mysterious
brotherhoods,
Fache
suspected
the
wily
historian
was
setting
the
stage
for
his
lawyers
to
plead
an
insanity
defense.
Sure,
Fache
thought.
Insane.
Teabing
had
displayed
ingenious
precision
in
formulating
a
plan
that
protected
his
innocence
at
every
turn.
He
had
exploited
both
the
Vatican
and
Opus
Dei,
two
groups
that
turned
out
to
be
completely
innocent.
His
dirty
work
had
been
carried
out
unknowingly
by
a
fanatical
monk
and
a
desperate
bishop.
More
clever
still,
Teabing
had
situated
his
electronic
listening
post
in
the
one
place
a
man
with
polio
could
not
possibly
reach.
The
actual
surveillance
had
been
carried
out
by
his
manservant,
Remy
the
lone
person
privy
to
Teabing's
true
identity
now
conveniently
dead
of
an
allergic
reaction.
Hardly
the
handiwork
of
someone
lacking
mental
faculties,
Fache
thought.
The
information
coming
from
Collet
out
of
Chateau
Villette
suggested
that
Teabing's
cunning
ran
so
deep
that
Fache
himself
might
even
learn
from
it.
To
successfully
hide
bugs
in
some
of
Paris's
most
powerful
offices,
the
British
historian
had
turned
to
the
Greeks.
Trojan
horses.
Some
of
Teabing's
intended
targets
received
lavish
gifts
of
artwork,
others
unwittingly
bid
at
auctions
in
which
Teabing
had
placed
specific
lots.
In
Sauniere's
case,
the
curator
had
received
a
dinner
invitation
to
Chateau
Villette
to
discuss
the
possibility
of
Teabing's
funding
a
new
Da
Vinci
Wing
at
the
Louvre.
Sauniere's
invitation
had
contained
an
innocuous
postscript
expressing
fascination
with
a
robotic
knight
that
Sauniere
was
rumored
to
have
built.
Bring
him
to
dinner,
Teabing
had
suggested.
Sauniere
apparently
had
done
just
that
and
left
the
knight
unattended
long
enough
for
Remy
Legaludec
to
make
one
inconspicuous
addition.
Now,
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
cab,
Fache
closed
his
eyes.
One
more
thing
to
attend
to
before
I
return
to
Paris.
The
St.
Mary's
Hospital
recovery
room
was
sunny.
"You've
impressed
us
all,"
the
nurse
said,
smiling
down
at
him.
"Nothing
short
of
miraculous."
Bishop
Aringarosa
gave
a
weak
smile.
"I
have
always
been
blessed."
The
nurse
finished
puttering,
leaving
the
bishop
alone.
The
sunlight
felt
welcome
and
warm
on
his
face.
Last
night
had
been
the
darkest
night
of
his
life.
Despondently,
he
thought
of
Silas,
whose
body
had
been
found
in
the
park.
Please
forgive
me,
my
son.
Aringarosa
had
longed
for
Silas
to
be
part
of
his
glorious
plan.
Last
night,
however,
Aringarosa
had
received
a
call
from
Bezu
Fache,
questioning
the
bishop
about
his
apparent
connection
to
a
nun
who
had
been
murdered
in
Saint
Sulpice.
Aringarosa
realized
the
evening
had
taken
a
horrifying
turn.
News
of
the
four
additional
murders
transformed
his
horror
to
anguish.
Silas,
what
have
you
done!
Unable
to
reach
the
Teacher,
the
bishop
knew
he
had
been
cut
loose.
Used.
The
only
way
to
stop
the
horrific
chain
of
events
he
had
helped
put
in
motion
was
to
confess
everything
to
Fache,
and
from
that
moment
on,
Aringarosa
and
Fache
had
been
racing
to
catch
up
with
Silas
before
the
Teacher
persuaded
him
to
kill
again.
Feeling
bone
weary,
Aringarosa
closed
his
eyes
and
listened
to
the
television
coverage
of
the
arrest
of
a
prominent
British
knight,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing.
The
Teacher
laid
bare
for
all
to
see.
Teabing
had
caught
wind
of
the
Vatican's
plans
to
disassociate
itself
from
Opus
Dei.
He
had
chosen
Aringarosa
as
the
perfect
pawn
in
his
plan.
After
all,
who
more
likely
to
leap
blindly
after
the
Holy
Grail
than
a
man
like
myself
with
everything
to
lose?
The
Grail
would
have
brought
enormous
power
to
anyone
who
possessed
it.
Leigh
Teabing
had
protected
his
identity
shrewdly
feigning
a
French
accent
and
a
pious
heart,
and
demanding
as
payment
the
one
thing
he
did
not
need
money.
Aringarosa
had
been
far
too
eager
to
be
suspicious.
The
price
tag
of
twenty
million
euro
was
paltry
when
compared
with
the
prize
of
obtaining
the
Grail,
and
with
the
Vatican's
separation
payment
to
Opus
Dei,
the
finances
had
worked
nicely.
The
blind
see
what
they
want
to
see.
Teabing's
ultimate
insult,
of
course,
had
been
to
demand
payment
in
Vatican
bonds,
such
that
if
anything
went
wrong,
the
investigation
would
lead
to
Rome.
"I
am
glad
to
see
you're
well,
My
Lord."
Aringarosa
recognized
the
gruff
voice
in
the
doorway,
but
the
face
was
unexpected
stern,
powerful
features,
slicked
back
hair,
and
a
broad
neck
that
strained
against
his
dark
suit.
"Captain
Fache?"
Aringarosa
asked.
The
compassion
and
concern
the
captain
had
shown
for
Aringarosa's
plight
last
night
had
conjured
images
of
a
far
gentler
physique.
The
captain
approached
the
bed
and
hoisted
a
familiar,
heavy
black
briefcase
onto
a
chair.
"I
believe
this
belongs
to
you."
Aringarosa
looked
at
the
briefcase
filled
with
bonds
and
immediately
looked
away,
feeling
only
shame.
"Yes
thank
you."
He
paused
while
working
his
fingers
across
the
seam
of
his
bedsheet,
then
continued.
"Captain,
I
have
been
giving
this
deep
thought,
and
I
need
to
ask
a
favor
of
you."
"Of
course."
"The
families
of
those
in
Paris
who
Silas"
He
paused,
swallowing
the
emotion.
"I
realize
no
sum
could
possibly
serve
as
sufficient
restitution,
and
yet,
if
you
could
be
kind
enough
to
divide
the
contents
of
this
briefcase
among
them
the
families
of
the
deceased."
Fache's
dark
eyes
studied
him
a
long
moment.
"A
virtuous
gesture,
My
Lord.
I
will
see
to
it
your
wishes
are
carried
out.
A
heavy
silence
fell
between
them.
On
the
television,
a
lean
French
police
officer
was
giving
a
press
conference
in
front
of
a
sprawling
mansion.
Fache
saw
who
it
was
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
screen.
"Lieutenant
Collet,"
a
BBC
reporter
said,
her
voice
accusing.
"Last
night,
your
captain
publicly
charged
two
innocent
people
with
murder.
Will
Robert
Langdon
and
Sophie
Neveu
be
seeking
accountability
from
your
department?
Will
this
cost
Captain
Fache
his
job?"
Lieutenant
Collet's
smile
was
tired
but
calm.
"It
is
my
experience
that
Captain
Bezu
Fache
seldom
makes
mistakes.
I
have
not
yet
spoken
to
him
on
this
matter,
but
knowing
how
he
operates,
I
suspect
his
public
manhunt
for
Agent
Neveu
and
Mr.
Langdon
was
part
of
a
ruse
to
lure
out
the
real
killer.
The
reporters
exchanged
surprised
looks.
Collet
continued.
"Whether
or
not
Mr.
Langdon
and
Agent
Neveu
were
willing
participants
in
the
sting,
I
do
not
know.
Captain
Fache
tends
to
keep
his
more
creative
methods
to
himself.
All
I
can
confirm
at
this
point
is
that
the
captain
has
successfully
arrested
the
man
responsible,
and
that
Mr.
Langdon
and
Agent
Neveu
are
both
innocent
and
safe."
Fache
had
a
faint
smile
on
his
lips
as
he
turned
back
to
Aringarosa.
"A
good
man,
that
Collet."
Several
moments
passed.
Finally,
Fache
ran
his
hand
over
his
forehead,
slicking
back
his
hair
as
he
gazed
down
at
Aringarosa.
"My
Lord,
before
I
return
to
Paris,
there
is
one
final
matter
I'd
like
to
discuss
your
impromptu
flight
to
London.
You
bribed
a
pilot
to
change
course.
In
doing
so,
you
broke
a
number
of
international
laws."
Aringarosa
slumped.
"I
was
desperate."
"Yes.
As
was
the
pilot
when
my
men
interrogated
him."
Fache
reached
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
purple
amethyst
ring
with
a
familiar
hand
tooled
mitre
crozier
applique.
Aringarosa
felt
tears
welling
as
he
accepted
the
ring
and
slipped
it
back
on
his
finger.
"You've
been
so
kind."
He
held
out
his
hand
and
clasped
Fache's.
"Thank
you."
Fache
waved
off
the
gesture,
walking
to
the
window
and
gazing
out
at
the
city,
his
thoughts
obviously
far
away.
When
he
turned,
there
was
an
uncertainty
about
him.
"My
Lord,
where
do
you
go
from
here?"
Aringarosa
had
been
asked
the
exact
same
question
as
he
left
Castel
Gandolfo
the
night
before.
"I
suspect
my
path
is
as
uncertain
as
yours."
"Yes."
Fache
paused.
"I
suspect
I
will
be
retiring
early."
Aringarosa
smiled.
"A
little
faith
can
do
wonders,
Captain.
A
little
faith.
Rosslyn
Chapel
often
called
the
Cathedral
of
Codes
stands
seven
miles
south
of
Edinburgh,
Scotland,
on
the
site
of
an
ancient
Mithraic
temple.
Built
by
the
Knights
Templar
in
1446,
the
chapel
is
engraved
with
a
mind
boggling
array
of
symbols
from
the
Jewish,
Christian,
Egyptian,
Masonic,
and
pagan
traditions.
The
chapel's
geographic
coordinates
fall
precisely
on
the
north
south
meridian
that
runs
through
Glastonbury.
This
longitudinal
Rose
Line
is
the
traditional
marker
of
King
Arthur's
Isle
of
Avalon
and
is
considered
the
central
pillar
of
Britain's
sacred
geometry.
It
is
from
this
hallowed
Rose
Line
that
Rosslyn
originally
spelled
Roslin
takes
its
name.
Rosslyn's
rugged
spires
were
casting
long
evening
shadows
as
Robert
Langdon
and
Sophie
Neveu
pulled
their
rental
car
into
the
grassy
parking
area
at
the
foot
of
the
bluff
on
which
the
chapel
stood.
Their
short
flight
from
London
to
Edinburgh
had
been
restful,
although
neither
of
them
had
slept
for
the
anticipation
of
what
lay
ahead.
Gazing
up
at
the
stark
edifice
framed
against
a
cloud
swept
sky,
Langdon
felt
like
Alice
falling
headlong
into
the
rabbit
hole.
This
must
be
a
dream.
And
yet
he
knew
the
text
of
Sauniere's
final
message
could
not
have
been
more
specific.
The
Holy
Grail
'neath
ancient
Roslin
waits.
Langdon
had
fantasized
that
Sauniere's
"Grail
map"
would
be
a
diagram
a
drawing
with
an
X
marks
the
spot
and
yet
the
Priory's
final
secret
had
been
unveiled
in
the
same
way
Sauniere
had
spoken
to
them
from
the
beginning.
Simple
verse.
Four
explicit
lines
that
pointed
without
a
doubt
to
this
very
spot.
In
addition
to
identifying
Rosslyn
by
name,
the
verse
made
reference
to
several
of
the
chapel's
renowned
architectural
features.
Despite
the
clarity
of
Sauniere's
final
revelation,
Langdon
had
been
left
feeling
more
off
balance
than
enlightened.
To
him,
Rosslyn
Chapel
seemed
far
too
obvious
a
location.
For
centuries,
this
stone
chapel
had
echoed
with
whispers
of
the
Holy
Grail's
presence.
The
whispers
had
turned
to
shouts
in
recent
decades
when
ground
penetrating
radar
revealed
the
presence
of
an
astonishing
structure
beneath
the
chapel
a
massive
subterranean
chamber.
Not
only
did
this
deep
vault
dwarf
the
chapel
atop
it,
but
it
appeared
to
have
no
entrance
or
exit.
Archaeologists
petitioned
to
begin
blasting
through
the
bedrock
to
reach
the
mysterious
chamber,
but
the
Rosslyn
Trust
expressly
forbade
any
excavation
of
the
sacred
site.
Of
course,
this
only
fueled
the
fires
of
speculation.
What
was
the
Rosslyn
Trust
trying
to
hide?
Rosslyn
had
now
become
a
pilgrimage
site
for
mystery
seekers.
Some
claimed
they
were
drawn
here
by
the
powerful
magnetic
field
that
emanated
inexplicably
from
these
coordinates,
some
claimed
they
came
to
search
the
hillside
for
a
hidden
entrance
to
the
vault,
but
most
admitted
they
had
come
simply
to
wander
the
grounds
and
absorb
the
lore
of
the
Holy
Grail.
Although
Langdon
had
never
been
to
Rosslyn
before
now,
he
always
chuckled
when
he
heard
the
chapel
described
as
the
current
home
of
the
Holy
Grail.
Admittedly,
Rosslyn
once
might
have
been
home
to
the
Grail,
long
ago
but
certainly
no
longer.
Far
too
much
attention
had
been
drawn
to
Rosslyn
in
past
decades,
and
sooner
or
later
someone
would
find
a
way
to
break
into
the
vault.
True
Grail
academics
agreed
that
Rosslyn
was
a
decoy
one
of
the
devious
dead
ends
the
Priory
crafted
so
convincingly.
Tonight,
however,
with
the
Priory's
keystone
offering
a
verse
that
pointed
directly
to
this
spot,
Langdon
no
longer
felt
so
smug.
A
perplexing
question
had
been
running
through
his
mind
all
day:
Why
would
Sauniere
go
to
such
effort
to
guide
us
to
so
obvious
a
location?
There
seemed
only
one
logical
answer.
There
is
something
about
Rosslyn
we
have
yet
to
understand.
"Robert?"
Sophie
was
standing
outside
the
car,
looking
back
at
him.
"Are
you
corning?"
She
was
holding
the
rosewood
box,
which
Captain
Fache
had
returned
to
them.
Inside,
both
cryptexes
had
been
reassembled
and
nested
as
they
had
been
found.
The
papyrus
verse
was
locked
safely
at
its
core
minus
the
shattered
vial
of
vinegar.
Making
their
way
up
the
long
gravel
path,
Langdon
and
Sophie
passed
the
famous
west
wall
of
the
chapel.
Casual
visitors
assumed
this
oddly
protruding
wall
was
a
section
of
the
chapel
that
had
not
been
finished.
The
truth,
Langdon
recalled,
was
far
more
intriguing.
The
west
wall
of
Solomon's
Temple.
The
Knights
Templar
had
designed
Rosslyn
Chapel
as
an
exact
architectural
blueprint
of
Solomon's
Temple
in
Jerusalem
complete
with
a
west
wall,
a
narrow
rectangular
sanctuary,
and
a
subterranean
vault
like
the
Holy
of
Holies,
in
which
the
original
nine
knights
had
first
unearthed
their
priceless
treasure.
Langdon
had
to
admit,
there
existed
an
intriguing
symmetry
in
the
idea
of
the
Templars
building
a
modern
Grail
repository
that
echoed
the
Grail's
original
hiding
place.
Rosslyn
Chapel's
entrance
was
more
modest
than
Langdon
expected.
The
small
wooden
door
had
two
iron
hinges
and
a
simple,
oak
sign.
ROSLIN
This
ancient
spelling,
Langdon
explained
to
Sophie,
derived
from
the
Rose
Line
meridian
on
which
the
chapel
sat;
or,
as
Grail
academics
preferred
to
believe,
from
the
"Line
of
Rose"
the
ancestral
lineage
of
Mary
Magdalene.
The
chapel
would
be
closing
soon,
and
as
Langdon
pulled
open
the
door,
a
warm
puff
of
air
escaped,
as
if
the
ancient
edifice
were
heaving
a
weary
sigh
at
the
end
of
a
long
day.
Her
entry
arches
burgeoned
with
carved
cinquefoils.
Roses.
The
womb
of
the
goddess.
Entering
with
Sophie,
Langdon
felt
his
eyes
reaching
across
the
famous
sanctuary
and
taking
it
all
in.
Although
he
had
read
accounts
of
Rosslyn's
arrestingly
intricate
stonework,
seeing
it
in
person
was
an
overwhelming
encounter.
Symbology
heaven,
one
of
Langdon's
colleagues
had
called
it.
Every
surface
in
the
chapel
had
been
carved
with
symbols
Christian
cruciforms,
Jewish
stars,
Masonic
seals,
Templar
crosses,
cornucopias,
pyramids,
astrological
signs,
plants,
vegetables,
pentacles,
and
roses.
The
Knights
Templar
had
been
master
stonemasons,
erecting
Templar
churches
all
over
Europe,
but
Rosslyn
was
considered
their
most
sublime
labor
of
love
and
veneration.
The
master
masons
had
left
no
stone
uncarved.
Rosslyn
Chapel
was
a
shrine
to
all
faiths
to
all
traditions
and,
above
all,
to
nature
and
the
goddess.
The
sanctuary
was
empty
except
for
a
handful
of
visitors
listening
to
a
young
man
giving
the
day's
last
tour.
He
was
leading
them
in
a
single
file
line
along
a
well
known
route
on
the
floor
an
invisible
pathway
linking
six
key
architectural
points
within
the
sanctuary.
Generations
of
visitors
had
walked
these
straight
lines,
connecting
the
points,
and
their
countless
footsteps
had
engraved
an
enormous
symbol
on
the
floor.
The
Star
of
David,
Langdon
thought.
No
coincidence
there.
Also
known
as
Solomon's
Seal,
this
hexagram
had
once
been
the
secret
symbol
of
the
stargazing
priests
and
was
later
adopted
by
the
Israelite
kings
David
and
Solomon.
The
docent
had
seen
Langdon
and
Sophie
enter,
and
although
it
was
closing
time,
offered
a
pleasant
smile
and
motioned
for
them
to
feel
free
to
look
around.
Langdon
nodded
his
thanks
and
began
to
move
deeper
into
the
sanctuary.
Sophie,
however,
stood
riveted
in
the
entryway,
a
puzzled
look
on
her
face.
"What
is
it?"
Langdon
asked.
Sophie
stared
out
at
the
chapel.
"I
think
I've
been
here."
Langdon
was
surprised.
"But
you
said
you
hadn't
even
heard
of
Rosslyn."
"I
hadn't"
She
scanned
the
sanctuary,
looking
uncertain.
"My
grandfather
must
have
brought
me
here
when
I
was
very
young.
I
don't
know.
It
feels
familiar."
As
her
eyes
scanned
the
room,
she
began
nodding
with
more
certainty.
"Yes."
She
pointed
to
the
front
of
the
sanctuary.
"Those
two
pillars
I've
seen
them."
Langdon
looked
at
the
pair
of
intricately
sculpted
columns
at
the
far
end
of
the
sanctuary.
Their
white
lacework
carvings
seemed
to
smolder
with
a
ruddy
glow
as
the
last
of
the
day's
sunlight
streamed
in
through
the
west
window.
The
pillars
positioned
where
the
altar
would
normally
stand
were
an
oddly
matched
pair.
The
pillar
on
the
left
was
carved
with
simple,
vertical
lines,
while
the
pillar
on
the
right
was
embellished
with
an
ornate,
flowering
spiral.
Sophie
was
already
moving
toward
them.
Langdon
hurried
after
her,
and
as
they
reached
the
pillars,
Sophie
was
nodding
with
incredulity.
"Yes,
I'm
positive
I
have
seen
these!"
"I
don't
doubt
you've
seen
them,"
Langdon
said,
"but
it
wasn't
necessarily
here.
She
turned.
"What
do
you
mean?"
"These
two
pillars
are
the
most
duplicated
architectural
structures
in
history.
Replicas
exist
all
over
the
world."
"Replicas
of
Rosslyn?"
She
looked
skeptical.
"No.
Of
the
pillars.
Do
you
remember
earlier
that
I
mentioned
Rosslyn
itself
is
a
copy
of
Solomon's
Temple?
Those
two
pillars
are
exact
replicas
of
the
two
pillars
that
stood
at
the
head
of
Solomon's
Temple."
Langdon
pointed
to
the
pillar
on
the
left.
"That's
called
Boaz
or
the
Mason's
Pillar.
The
other
is
called
Jachin
or
the
Apprentice
Pillar."
He
paused.
"In
fact,
virtually
every
Masonic
temple
in
the
world
has
two
pillars
like
these."
Langdon
had
already
explained
to
her
about
the
Templars'
powerful
historic
ties
to
the
modern
Masonic
secret
societies,
whose
primary
degrees
Apprentice
Freemason,
Fellowcraft
Freemason,
and
Master
Mason
harked
back
to
early
Templar
days.
Sophie's
grandfather's
final
verse
made
direct
reference
to
the
Master
Masons
who
adorned
Rosslyn
with
their
carved
artistic
offerings.
It
also
noted
Rosslyn's
central
ceiling,
which
was
covered
with
carvings
of
stars
and
planets.
"I've
never
been
in
a
Masonic
temple,"
Sophie
said,
still
eyeing
the
pillars.
"I
am
almost
positive
I
saw
these
here.
"
She
turned
back
into
the
chapel,
as
if
looking
for
something
else
to
jog
her
memory.
The
rest
of
the
visitors
were
now
leaving,
and
the
young
docent
made
his
way
across
the
chapel
to
them
with
a
pleasant
smile.
He
was
a
handsome
young
man
in
his
late
twenties,
with
a
Scottish
brogue
and
strawberry
blond
hair.
"I'm
about
to
close
up
for
the
day.
May
I
help
you
find
anything?"
How
about
the
Holy
Grail?
Langdon
wanted
to
say.
"The
code,"
Sophie
blurted,
in
sudden
revelation.
"There's
a
code
here!"
The
docent
looked
pleased
by
her
enthusiasm.
"Yes
there
is,
ma'am."
"It's
on
the
ceiling,"
she
said,
turning
to
the
right
hand
wall.
"Somewhere
over
there."
He
smiled.
"Not
your
first
visit
to
Rosslyn,
I
see."
The
code,
Langdon
thought.
He
had
forgotten
that
little
bit
of
lore.
Among
Rosslyn's
numerous
mysteries
was
a
vaulted
archway
from
which
hundreds
of
stone
blocks
protruded,
jutting
down
to
form
a
bizarre
multifaceted
surface.
Each
block
was
carved
with
a
symbol,
seemingly
at
random,
creating
a
cipher
of
unfathomable
proportion.
Some
people
believed
the
code
revealed
the
entrance
to
the
vault
beneath
the
chapel.
Others
believed
it
told
the
true
Grail
legend.
Not
that
it
mattered
cryptographers
had
been
trying
for
centuries
to
decipher
its
meaning.
To
this
day
the
Rosslyn
Trust
offered
a
generous
reward
to
anyone
who
could
unveil
the
secret
meaning,
but
the
code
remained
a
mystery.
"I'd
be
happy
to
show"
The
docent's
voice
trailed
off.
My
first
code,
Sophie
thought,
moving
alone,
in
a
trance,
toward
the
encoded
archway.
Having
handed
the
rosewood
box
to
Langdon,
she
could
feel
herself
momentarily
forgetting
all
about
the
Holy
Grail,
the
Priory
of
Sion,
and
all
the
mysteries
of
the
past
day.
When
she
arrived
beneath
the
encoded
ceiling
and
saw
the
symbols
above
her,
the
memories
came
flooding
back.
She
was
recalling
her
first
visit
here,
and
strangely,
the
memories
conjured
an
unexpected
sadness.
She
was
a
little
girl
a
year
or
so
after
her
family's
death.
Her
grandfather
had
brought
her
to
Scotland
on
a
short
vacation.
They
had
come
to
see
Rosslyn
Chapel
before
going
back
to
Paris.
It
was
late
evening,
and
the
chapel
was
closed.
But
they
were
still
inside.
"Can
we
go
home,
Grand
pere?"
Sophie
begged,
feeling
tired.
"Soon,
dear,
very
soon."
His
voice
was
melancholy.
"I
have
one
last
thing
I
need
to
do
here.
How
about
if
you
wait
in
the
car?"
"You're
doing
another
big
person
thing?"
He
nodded.
"I'll
be
fast.
I
promise."
"Can
I
do
the
archway
code
again?
That
was
fun."
"I
don't
know.
I
have
to
step
outside.
You
won't
be
frightened
in
here
alone?"
"Of
course
not!"
she
said
with
a
huff.
"It's
not
even
dark
yet!"
He
smiled.
"Very
well
then.
"
He
led
her
over
to
the
elaborate
archway
he
had
shown
her
earlier.
Sophie
immediately
plopped
down
on
the
stone
floor,
lying
on
her
back
and
staring
up
at
the
collage
of
puzzle
pieces
overhead.
"I'm
going
to
break
this
code
before
you
get
back!"
"It's
a
race
then."
He
bent
over,
kissed
her
forehead,
and
walked
to
the
nearby
side
door.
"I'll
be
right
outside.
I'll
leave
the
door
open.
If
you
need
me,
just
call."
He
exited
into
the
soft
evening
light.
Sophie
lay
there
on
the
floor,
gazing
up
at
the
code.
Her
eyes
felt
sleepy.
After
a
few
minutes,
the
symbols
got
fuzzy.
And
then
they
disappeared.
When
Sophie
awoke,
the
floor
felt
cold.
"Grand
pere?"
There
was
no
answer.
Standing
up,
she
brushed
herself
off.
The
side
door
was
still
open.
The
evening
was
getting
darker.
She
walked
outside
and
could
see
her
grandfather
standing
on
the
porch
of
a
nearby
stone
house
directly
behind
the
church.
Her
grandfather
was
talking
quietly
to
a
person
barely
visible
inside
the
screened
door.
"Grand
pere
?
"
she
called.
Her
grandfather
turned
and
waved,
motioning
for
her
to
wait
just
a
moment.
Then,
slowly,
he
said
some
final
words
to
the
person
inside
and
blew
a
kiss
toward
the
screened
door.
He
came
to
her
with
tearful
eyes.
"Why
are
you
crying,
Grand
pere?"
He
picked
her
up
and
held
her
close.
"Oh,
Sophie,
you
and
I
have
said
good
bye
to
a
lot
of
people
this
year.
It's
hard."
Sophie
thought
of
the
accident,
of
saying
good
bye
to
her
mother
and
father,
her
grandmother
and
baby
brother.
"Were
you
saying
goodbye
to
another
person?"
"To
a
dear
friend
whom
I
love
very
much,"
he
replied,
his
voice
heavy
with
emotion.
"And
I
fear
I
will
not
see
her
again
for
a
very
long
time."
Standing
with
the
docent,
Langdon
had
been
scanning
the
chapel
walls
and
feeling
a
rising
wariness
that
a
dead
end
might
be
looming.
Sophie
had
wandered
off
to
look
at
the
code
and
left
Langdon
holding
the
rosewood
box,
which
contained
a
Grail
map
that
now
appeared
to
be
no
help
at
all.
Although
Sauniere's
poem
clearly
indicated
Rosslyn,
Langdon
was
not
sure
what
to
do
now
that
they
had
arrived.
The
poem
made
reference
to
a
"blade
and
chalice,"
which
Langdon
saw
nowhere.
The
Holy
Grail
'neath
ancient
Roslin
waits.
The
blade
and
chalice
guarding
o'er
Her
gates.
Again
Langdon
sensed
there
remained
some
facet
of
this
mystery
yet
to
reveal
itself.
"I
hate
to
pry,"
the
docent
said,
eyeing
the
rosewood
box
in
Langdon's
hands.
"But
this
box
might
I
ask
where
you
got
it?"
Langdon
gave
a
weary
laugh.
"That's
an
exceptionally
long
story."
The
young
man
hesitated,
his
eyes
on
the
box
again.
"It's
the
strangest
thing
my
grandmother
has
a
box
exactly
like
that
a
jewelry
box.
Identical
polished
rosewood,
same
inlaid
rose,
even
the
hinges
look
the
same."
Langdon
knew
the
young
man
must
be
mistaken.
If
ever
a
box
had
been
one
of
a
kind,
it
was
this
one
the
box
custom
made
for
the
Priory
keystone.
"The
two
boxes
may
be
similar
but
The
side
door
closed
loudly,
drawing
both
of
their
gazes.
Sophie
had
exited
without
a
word
and
was
now
wandering
down
the
bluff
toward
a
fieldstone
house
nearby.
Langdon
stared
after
her.
Where
is
she
going?
She
had
been
acting
strangely
ever
since
they
entered
the
building.
He
turned
to
the
docent.
"Do
you
know
what
that
house
is?"
He
nodded,
also
looking
puzzled
that
Sophie
was
going
down
there.
"That's
the
chapel
rectory.
The
chapel
curator
lives
there.
She
also
happens
to
be
the
head
of
the
Rosslyn
Trust."
He
paused.
"And
my
grandmother."
"Your
grandmother
heads
the
Rosslyn
Trust?"
The
young
man
nodded.
"I
live
with
her
in
the
rectory
and
help
keep
up
the
chapel
and
give
tours."
He
shrugged.
"I've
lived
here
my
whole
life.
My
grandmother
raised
me
in
that
house."
Concerned
for
Sophie,
Langdon
moved
across
the
chapel
toward
the
door
to
call
out
to
her.
He
was
only
halfway
there
when
he
stopped
short.
Something
the
young
man
said
just
registered.
My
grandmother
raised
me.
Langdon
looked
out
at
Sophie
on
the
bluff,
then
down
at
the
rosewood
box
in
his
hand.
Impossible.
Slowly,
Langdon
turned
back
to
the
young
man.
"You
said
your
grandmother
has
a
box
like
this
one?"
"Almost
identical."
"Where
did
she
get
it?"
"My
grandfather
made
it
for
her.
He
died
when
I
was
a
baby,
but
my
grandmother
still
talks
about
him.
She
says
he
was
a
genius
with
his
hands.
He
made
all
kinds
of
things."
Langdon
glimpsed
an
unimaginable
web
of
connections
emerging.
"You
said
your
grandmother
raised
you.
Do
you
mind
my
asking
what
happened
to
your
parents?"
The
young
man
looked
surprised.
"They
died
when
I
was
young."
He
paused.
"The
same
day
as
my
grandfather."
Langdon's
heart
pounded.
"In
a
car
accident?"
The
docent
recoiled,
a
look
of
bewilderment
in
his
olive
green
eyes.
"Yes.
In
a
car
accident.
My
entire
family
died
that
day.
I
lost
my
grandfather,
my
parents,
and"
He
hesitated,
glancing
down
at
the
floor.
"And
your
sister,"
Langdon
said.
Out
on
the
bluff,
the
fieldstone
house
was
exactly
as
Sophie
remembered
it.
Night
was
falling
now,
and
the
house
exuded
a
warm
and
inviting
aura.
The
smell
of
bread
wafted
through
the
opened
screened
door,
and
a
golden
light
shone
in
the
windows.
As
Sophie
approached,
she
could
hear
the
quiet
sounds
of
sobbing
from
within.
Through
the
screened
door,
Sophie
saw
an
elderly
woman
in
the
hallway.
Her
back
was
to
the
door,
but
Sophie
could
see
she
was
crying.
The
woman
had
long,
luxuriant,
silver
hair
that
conjured
an
unexpected
wisp
of
memory.
Feeling
herself
drawn
closer,
Sophie
stepped
onto
the
porch
stairs.
The
woman
was
clutching
a
framed
photograph
of
a
man
and
touching
her
fingertips
to
his
face
with
loving
sadness.
It
was
a
face
Sophie
knew
well.
Grand
pere.
The
woman
had
obviously
heard
the
sad
news
of
his
death
last
night.
A
board
squeaked
beneath
Sophie's
feet,
and
the
woman
turned
slowly,
her
sad
eyes
finding
Sophie's.
Sophie
wanted
to
run,
but
she
stood
transfixed.
The
woman's
fervent
gaze
never
wavered
as
she
set
down
the
photo
and
approached
the
screened
door.
An
eternity
seemed
to
pass
as
the
two
women
stared
at
one
another
through
the
thin
mesh.
Then,
like
the
slowly
gathering
swell
of
an
ocean
wave,
the
woman's
visage
transformed
from
one
of
uncertainty
to
disbelief
to
hope
and
finally,
to
cresting
joy.
Throwing
open
the
door,
she
came
out,
reaching
with
soft
hands,
cradling
Sophie's
thunderstruck
face.
"Oh,
dear
child
look
at
you!"
Although
Sophie
did
not
recognize
her,
she
knew
who
this
woman
was.
She
tried
to
speak
but
found
she
could
not
even
breathe.
"Sophie,"
the
woman
sobbed,
kissing
her
forehead.
Sophie's
words
were
a
choked
whisper.
"But
Grand
pere
said
you
were"
"I
know."
The
woman
placed
her
tender
hands
on
Sophie's
shoulders
and
gazed
at
her
with
familiar
eyes.
"Your
grandfather
and
I
were
forced
to
say
so
many
things.
We
did
what
we
thought
was
right.
I'm
so
sorry.
It
was
for
your
own
safety,
princess."
Sophie
heard
her
final
word,
and
immediately
thought
of
her
grandfather,
who
had
called
her
princess
for
so
many
years.
The
sound
of
his
voice
seemed
to
echo
now
in
the
ancient
stones
of
Rosslyn,
settling
through
the
earth
and
reverberating
in
the
unknown
hollows
below.
The
woman
threw
her
arms
around
Sophie,
the
tears
flowing
faster.
"Your
grandfather
wanted
so
badly
to
tell
you
everything.
But
things
were
difficult
between
you
two.
He
tried
so
hard.
There's
so
much
to
explain.
So
very
much
to
explain."
She
kissed
Sophie's
forehead
once
again,
then
whispered
in
her
ear.
"No
more
secrets,
princess.
It's
time
you
learn
the
truth
about
our
family."
Sophie
and
her
grandmother
were
seated
on
the
porch
stairs
in
a
tearful
hug
when
the
young
docent
dashed
across
the
lawn,
his
eyes
shining
with
hope
and
disbelief.
"Sophie?"
Through
her
tears,
Sophie
nodded,
standing.
She
did
not
know
the
young
man's
face,
but
as
they
embraced,
she
could
feel
the
power
of
the
blood
coursing
through
his
veins
the
blood
she
now
understood
they
shared.
When
Langdon
walked
across
the
lawn
to
join
them,
Sophie
could
not
imagine
that
only
yesterday
she
had
felt
so
alone
in
the
world.
And
now,
somehow,
in
this
foreign
place,
in
the
company
of
three
people
she
barely
knew,
she
felt
at
last
that
she
was
home.
Night
had
fallen
over
Rosslyn.
Robert
Langdon
stood
alone
on
the
porch
of
the
fieldstone
house
enjoying
the
sounds
of
laughter
and
reunion
drifting
through
the
screened
door
behind
him.
The
mug
of
potent
Brazilian
coffee
in
his
hand
had
granted
him
a
hazy
reprieve
from
his
mounting
exhaustion,
and
yet
he
sensed
the
reprieve
would
be
fleeting.
The
fatigue
in
his
body
went
to
the
core.
"You
slipped
out
quietly,"
a
voice
behind
him
said.
He
turned.
Sophie's
grandmother
emerged,
her
silver
hair
shimmering
in
the
night.
Her
name,
for
the
last
twenty
eight
years
at
least,
was
Marie
Chauvel.
Langdon
gave
a
tired
smile.
"I
thought
I'd
give
your
family
some
time
together."
Through
the
window,
he
could
see
Sophie
talking
with
her
brother.
Marie
came
over
and
stood
beside
him.
"Mr.
Langdon,
when
I
first
heard
of
Jacques's
murder,
I
was
terrified
for
Sophie's
safety.
Seeing
her
standing
in
my
doorway
tonight
was
the
greatest
relief
of
my
life.
I
cannot
thank
you
enough."
Langdon
had
no
idea
how
to
respond.
Although
he
had
offered
to
give
Sophie
and
her
grandmother
time
to
talk
in
private,
Marie
had
asked
him
to
stay
and
listen.
My
husband
obviously
trusted
you,
Mr.
Langdon,
so
I
do
as
well.
And
so
Langdon
had
remained,
standing
beside
Sophie
and
listening
in
mute
astonishment
while
Marie
told
the
story
of
Sophie's
late
parents.
Incredibly,
both
had
been
from
Merovingian
families
direct
descendants
of
Mary
Magdalene
and
Jesus
Christ.
Sophie's
parents
and
ancestors,
for
protection,
had
changed
their
family
names
of
Plantard
and
Saint
Clair.
Their
children
represented
the
most
direct
surviving
royal
bloodline
and
therefore
were
carefully
guarded
by
the
Priory.
When
Sophie's
parents
were
killed
in
a
car
accident
whose
cause
could
not
be
determined,
the
Priory
feared
the
identity
of
the
royal
line
had
been
discovered.
"Your
grandfather
and
I,"
Marie
had
explained
in
a
voice
choked
with
pain,
"had
to
make
a
grave
decision
the
instant
we
received
the
phone
call.
Your
parents'
car
had
just
been
found
in
the
river."
She
dabbed
at
the
tears
in
her
eyes.
"All
six
of
us
including
you
two
grandchildren
were
supposed
to
be
traveling
together
in
that
car
that
very
night.
Fortunately
we
changed
our
plans
at
the
last
moment,
and
your
parents
were
alone.
Hearing
of
the
accident,
Jacques
and
I
had
no
way
to
know
what
had
really
happened
or
if
this
was
truly
an
accident.
"
Marie
looked
at
Sophie.
"We
knew
we
had
to
protect
our
grandchildren,
and
we
did
what
we
thought
was
best.
Jacques
reported
to
the
police
that
your
brother
and
I
had
been
in
the
car
our
two
bodies
apparently
washed
off
in
the
current.
Then
your
brother
and
I
went
underground
with
the
Priory.
Jacques,
being
a
man
of
prominence,
did
not
have
the
luxury
of
disappearing.
It
only
made
sense
that
Sophie,
being
the
eldest,
would
stay
in
Paris
to
be
taught
and
raised
by
Jacques,
close
to
the
heart
and
protection
of
the
Priory."
Her
voice
fell
to
a
whisper.
"Separating
the
family
was
the
hardest
thing
we
ever
had
to
do.
Jacques
and
I
saw
each
other
only
very
infrequently,
and
always
in
the
most
secret
of
settings
under
the
protection
of
the
Priory.
There
are
certain
ceremonies
to
which
the
brotherhood
always
stays
faithful."
Langdon
had
sensed
the
story
went
far
deeper,
but
he
also
sensed
it
was
not
for
him
to
hear.
So
he
had
stepped
outside.
Now,
gazing
up
at
the
spires
of
Rosslyn,
Langdon
could
not
escape
the
hollow
gnaw
of
Rosslyn's
unsolved
mystery.
Is
the
Grail
really
here
at
Rosslyn?
And
if
so,
where
are
the
blade
and
chalice
that
Sauniere
mentioned
in
his
poem?
"I'll
take
that,"
Marie
said,
motioning
to
Langdon's
hand.
"Oh,
thank
you."
Langdon
held
out
his
empty
coffee
cup.
She
stared
at
him.
"I
was
referring
to
your
other
hand,
Mr.
Langdon."
Langdon
looked
down
and
realized
he
was
holding
Sauniere's
papyrus.
He
had
taken
it
from
the
cryptex
once
again
in
hopes
of
seeing
something
he
had
missed
earlier.
"Of
course,
I'm
sorry."
Marie
looked
amused
as
she
took
the
paper.
"I
know
of
a
man
at
a
bank
in
Paris
who
is
probably
very
eager
to
see
the
return
of
this
rosewood
box.
Andre
Vernet
was
a
dear
friend
of
Jacques,
and
Jacques
trusted
him
explicitly.
Andre
would
have
done
anything
to
honor
Jacques's
requests
for
the
care
of
this
box."
Including
shooting
me,
Langdon
recalled,
deciding
not
to
mention
that
he
had
probably
broken
the
poor
man's
nose.
Thinking
of
Paris,
Langdon
flashed
on
the
three
senechaux
who
had
been
killed
the
night
before.
"And
the
Priory?
What
happens
now?"
"The
wheels
are
already
in
motion,
Mr.
Langdon.
The
brotherhood
has
endured
for
centuries,
and
it
will
endure
this.
There
are
always
those
waiting
to
move
up
and
rebuild."
All
evening
Langdon
had
suspected
that
Sophie's
grandmother
was
closely
tied
to
the
operations
of
the
Priory.
After
all,
the
Priory
had
always
had
women
members.
Four
Grand
Masters
had
been
women.
The
senechaux
were
traditionally
men
the
guardians
and
yet
women
held
far
more
honored
status
within
the
Priory
and
could
ascend
to
the
highest
post
from
virtually
any
rank.
Langdon
thought
of
Leigh
Teabing
and
Westminster
Abbey.
It
seemed
a
lifetime
ago.
"Was
the
Church
pressuring
your
husband
not
to
release
the
Sangreal
documents
at
the
End
of
Days?"
"Heavens
no.
The
End
of
Days
is
a
legend
of
paranoid
minds.
There
is
nothing
in
the
Priory
doctrine
that
identifies
a
date
at
which
the
Grail
should
be
unveiled.
In
fact
the
Priory
has
always
maintained
that
the
Grail
should
never
be
unveiled."
"Never?"
Langdon
was
stunned.
"It
is
the
mystery
and
wonderment
that
serve
our
souls,
not
the
Grail
itself.
The
beauty
of
the
Grail
lies
in
her
ethereal
nature."
Marie
Chauvel
gazed
up
at
Rosslyn
now.
"For
some,
the
Grail
is
a
chalice
that
will
bring
them
everlasting
life.
For
others,
it
is
the
quest
for
lost
documents
and
secret
history.
And
for
most,
I
suspect
the
Holy
Grail
is
simply
a
grand
idea
a
glorious
unattainable
treasure
that
somehow,
even
in
today's
world
of
chaos,
inspires
us."
"But
if
the
Sangreal
documents
remain
hidden,
the
story
of
Mary
Magdalene
will
be
lost
forever,"
Langdon
said.
"Will
it?
Look
around
you.
Her
story
is
being
told
in
art,
music,
and
books.
More
so
every
day.
The
pendulum
is
swinging.
We
are
starting
to
sense
the
dangers
of
our
history
and
of
our
destructive
paths.
We
are
beginning
to
sense
the
need
to
restore
the
sacred
feminine."
She
paused.
"You
mentioned
you
are
writing
a
manuscript
about
the
symbols
of
the
sacred
feminine,
are
you
not?"
"I
am."
She
smiled.
"Finish
it,
Mr.
Langdon.
Sing
her
song.
The
world
needs
modern
troubadours."
Langdon
fell
silent,
feeling
the
weight
of
her
message
upon
him.
Across
the
open
spaces,
a
new
moon
was
rising
above
the
tree
line.
Turning
his
eyes
toward
Rosslyn,
Langdon
felt
a
boyish
craving
to
know
her
secrets.
Don't
ask,
he
told
himself.
This
is
not
the
moment.
He
glanced
at
the
papyrus
in
Marie's
hand,
and
then
back
at
Rosslyn.
"Ask
the
question,
Mr.
Langdon,"
Marie
said,
looking
amused.
"You
have
earned
the
right."
Langdon
felt
himself
flush.
"You
want
to
know
if
the
Grail
is
here
at
Rosslyn."
"Can
you
tell
me?"
She
sighed
in
mock
exasperation.
"Why
is
it
that
men
simply
cannot
let
the
Grail
rest?"
She
laughed,
obviously
enjoying
herself.
"Why
do
you
think
it's
here?"
Langdon
motioned
to
the
papyrus
in
her
hand.
"Your
husband's
poem
speaks
specifically
of
Rosslyn,
except
it
also
mentions
a
blade
and
chalice
watching
over
the
Grail.
I
didn't
see
any
symbols
of
the
blade
and
chalice
up
there."
"The
blade
and
chalice?"
Marie
asked.
"What
exactly
do
they
look
like?"
Langdon
sensed
she
was
toying
with
him,
but
he
played
along,
quickly
describing
the
symbols.
A
look
of
vague
recollection
crossed
her
face.
"Ah,
yes,
of
course.
The
blade
represents
all
that
is
masculine.
I
believe
it
is
drawn
like
this,
no?"
Using
her
index
finger,
she
traced
a
shape
on
her
palm.
A
"Yes,"
Langdon
said.
Marie
had
drawn
the
less
common
"closed"
form
of
the
blade,
although
Langdon
had
seen
the
symbol
portrayed
both
ways.
"And
the
inverse,"
she
said,
drawing
again
on
her
palm,
"is
the
chalice,
which
represents
the
feminine."
v
"Correct,"
Langdon
said.
"And
you
are
saying
that
in
all
the
hundreds
of
symbols
we
have
here
in
Rosslyn
Chapel,
these
two
shapes
appear
nowhere?"
"I
didn't
see
them."
"And
if
I
show
them
to
you,
will
you
get
some
sleep?"
Before
Langdon
could
answer,
Marie
Chauvel
had
stepped
off
the
porch
and
was
heading
toward
the
chapel.
Langdon
hurried
after
her.
Entering
the
ancient
building,
Marie
turned
on
the
lights
and
pointed
to
the
center
of
the
sanctuary
floor.
"There
you
are,
Mr.
Langdon.
The
blade
and
chalice."
Langdon
stared
at
the
scuffed
stone
floor.
It
was
blank.
"There's
nothing
here."
Marie
sighed
and
began
to
walk
along
the
famous
path
worn
into
the
chapel
floor,
the
same
path
Langdon
had
seen
the
visitors
walking
earlier
this
evening.
As
his
eyes
adjusted
to
see
the
giant
symbol,
he
still
felt
lost.
"But
that's
the
Star
of
Dav
Langdon
stopped
short,
mute
with
amazement
as
it
dawned
on
him.
The
blade
and
chalice.
Fused
as
one.
The
Star
of
David
the
perfect
union
of
male
and
female
Solomon's
Seal
marking
the
Holy
of
Holies,
where
the
male
and
female
deities
Yahweh
and
Shekinah
were
thought
to
dwell.
Langdon
needed
a
minute
to
find
his
words.
"The
verse
does
point
here
to
Rosslyn.
Completely.
Perfectly."
Marie
smiled.
"Apparently."
The
implications
chilled
him.
"So
the
Holy
Grail
is
in
the
vault
beneath
us?"
She
laughed.
"Only
in
spirit.
One
of
the
Priory's
most
ancient
charges
was
one
day
to
return
the
Grail
to
her
homeland
of
France
where
she
could
rest
for
eternity.
For
centuries,
she
was
dragged
across
the
countryside
to
keep
her
safe.
Most
undignified.
Jacques's
charge
when
he
became
Grand
Master
was
to
restore
her
honor
by
returning
her
to
France
and
building
her
a
resting
place
fit
for
a
queen."
"And
he
succeeded?"
Now
her
face
grew
serious.
"Mr.
Langdon,
considering
what
you've
done
for
me
tonight,
and
as
curator
of
the
Rosslyn
Trust,
I
can
tell
you
for
certain
that
the
Grail
is
no
longer
here."
Langdon
decided
to
press.
"But
the
keystone
is
supposed
to
point
to
the
place
where
the
Holy
Grail
is
hidden
now.
Why
does
it
point
to
Rosslyn?"
"Maybe
you're
misreading
its
meaning.
Remember,
the
Grail
can
be
deceptive.
As
could
my
late
husband."
"But
how
much
clearer
could
he
be?"
he
asked.
"We
are
standing
over
an
underground
vault
marked
by
the
blade
and
chalice,
underneath
a
ceiling
of
stars,
surrounded
by
the
art
of
Master
Masons.
Everything
speaks
of
Rosslyn."
"Very
well,
let
me
see
this
mysterious
verse."
She
unrolled
the
papyrus
and
read
the
poem
aloud
in
a
deliberate
tone.
The
Holy
Grail
'neath
ancient
Roslin
waits.
The
blade
and
chalice
guarding
o'er
Her
gates.
Adorned
in
masters'
loving
art,
She
lies.
She
rests
at
last
beneath
the
starry
skies.
When
she
finished,
she
was
still
for
several
seconds,
until
a
knowing
smile
crossed
her
lips.
"Aah,
Jacques."
Langdon
watched
her
expectantly.
"You
understand
this?"
"As
you
have
witnessed
on
the
chapel
floor,
Mr.
Langdon,
there
are
many
ways
to
see
simple
things."
Langdon
strained
to
understand.
Everything
about
Jacques
Sauniere
seemed
to
have
double
meanings,
and
yet
Langdon
could
see
no
further.
Marie
gave
a
tired
yawn.
"Mr.
Langdon,
I
will
make
a
confession
to
you.
I
have
never
officially
been
privy
to
the
present
location
of
the
Grail.
But,
of
course,
I
was
married
to
a
person
of
enormous
influence
and
my
women's
intuition
is
strong."
Langdon
started
to
speak
but
Marie
continued.
"I
am
sorry
that
after
all
your
hard
work,
you
will
be
leaving
Rosslyn
without
any
real
answers.
And
yet,
something
tells
me
you
will
eventually
find
what
you
seek.
One
day
it
will
dawn
on
you."
She
smiled.
"And
when
it
does,
I
trust
that
you,
of
all
people,
can
keep
a
secret."
There
was
a
sound
of
someone
arriving
in
the
doorway.
"Both
of
you
disappeared,"
Sophie
said,
entering.
"I
was
just
leaving,"
her
grandmother
replied,
walking
over
to
Sophie
at
the
door.
"Good
night,
princess."
She
kissed
Sophie's
forehead.
"Don't
keep
Mr.
Langdon
out
too
late."
Langdon
and
Sophie
watched
her
grandmother
walk
back
toward
the
fieldstone
house.
When
Sophie
turned
to
him,
her
eyes
were
awash
in
deep
emotion.
"Not
exactly
the
ending
I
expected."
That
makes
two
of
us,
he
thought.
Langdon
could
see
she
was
overwhelmed.
The
news
she
had
received
tonight
had
changed
everything
in
her
life.
"Are
you
okay?
It's
a
lot
to
take
in."
She
smiled
quietly.
"I
have
a
family.
That's
where
I'm
going
to
start.
Who
we
are
and
where
we
came
from
will
take
some
time."
Langdon
remained
silent.
"Beyond
tonight,
will
you
stay
with
us?"
Sophie
asked.
"At
least
for
a
few
days?"
Langdon
sighed,
wanting
nothing
more.
"You
need
some
time
here
with
your
family,
Sophie.
I'm
going
back
to
Paris
in
the
morning."
She
looked
disappointed
but
seemed
to
know
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do.
Neither
of
them
spoke
for
a
long
time.
Finally
Sophie
reached
over
and,
taking
his
hand,
led
him
out
of
the
chapel.
They
walked
to
a
small
rise
on
the
bluff.
From
here,
the
Scottish
countryside
spread
out
before
them,
suffused
in
a
pale
moonlight
that
sifted
through
the
departing
clouds.
They
stood
in
silence,
holding
hands,
both
of
them
fighting
the
descending
shroud
of
exhaustion.
The
stars
were
just
now
appearing,
but
to
the
east,
a
single
point
of
light
glowed
brighter
than
any
other.
Langdon
smiled
when
he
saw
it.
It
was
Venus.
The
ancient
Goddess
shining
down
with
her
steady
and
patient
light.
The
night
was
growing
cooler,
a
crisp
breeze
rolling
up
from
the
lowlands.
After
a
while,
Langdon
looked
over
at
Sophie.
Her
eyes
were
closed,
her
lips
relaxed
in
a
contented
smile.
Langdon
could
feel
his
own
eyes
growing
heavy.
Reluctantly,
he
squeezed
her
hand.
"Sophie?"
Slowly,
she
opened
her
eyes
and
turned
to
him.
Her
face
was
beautiful
in
the
moonlight.
She
gave
him
a
sleepy
smile.
"Hi."
Langdon
felt
an
unexpected
sadness
to
realize
he
would
be
returning
to
Paris
without
her.
"I
may
be
gone
before
you
wake
up."
He
paused,
a
knot
growing
in
his
throat.
"I'm
sorry,
I'm
not
very
good
at
Sophie
reached
out
and
placed
her
soft
hand
on
the
side
of
his
face.
Then,
leaning
forward,
she
kissed
him
tenderly
on
the
cheek.
"When
can
I
see
you
again?"
Langdon
reeled
momentarily,
lost
in
her
eyes.
"When?"
He
paused,
curious
if
she
had
any
idea
how
much
he
had
been
wondering
the
same
thing.
"Well,
actually,
next
month
I'm
lecturing
at
a
conference
in
Florence.
I'll
be
there
a
week
without
much
to
do."
"Is
that
an
invitation?"
"We'd
be
living
in
luxury.
They're
giving
me
a
room
at
the
Brunelleschi.
Sophie
smiled
playfully.
"You
presume
a
lot,
Mr.
Langdon."
He
cringed
at
how
it
had
sounded.
"What
I
meant
"I
would
love
nothing
more
than
to
meet
you
in
Florence,
Robert.
But
on
one
condition."
Her
tone
turned
serious.
"No
museums,
no
churches,
no
tombs,
no
art,
no
relics."
"In
Florence?
For
a
week?
There's
nothing
else
to
do."
Sophie
leaned
forward
and
kissed
him
again,
now
on
the
lips.
Their
bodies
came
together,
softly
at
first,
and
then
completely.
When
she
pulled
away,
her
eyes
were
full
of
promise.
"Right,"
Langdon
managed.
"It's
a
date."
Epilogue
Robert
Langdon
awoke
with
a
start.
He
had
been
dreaming.
The
bathrobe
beside
his
bed
bore
the
monogram
HOTEL
RITZ
PARIS.
He
saw
a
dim
light
filtering
through
the
blinds.
Is
it
dusk
or
dawn
?
he
wondered.
Langdon's
body
felt
warm
and
deeply
contented.
He
had
slept
the
better
part
of
the
last
two
days.
Sitting
up
slowly
in
bed,
he
now
realized
what
had
awoken
him
the
strangest
thought.
For
days
he
had
been
trying
to
sort
through
a
barrage
of
information,
but
now
Langdon
found
himself
fixed
on
something
he'd
not
considered
before.
Could
it
be?
He
remained
motionless
a
long
moment.
Getting
out
of
bed,
he
walked
to
the
marble
shower.
Stepping
inside,
he
let
the
powerful
jets
message
his
shoulders.
Still,
the
thought
enthralled
him.
Impossible.
Twenty
minutes
later,
Langdon
stepped
out
of
the
Hotel
Ritz
into
Place
Vendome.
Night
was
falling.
The
days
of
sleep
had
left
him
disoriented
and
yet
his
mind
felt
oddly
lucid.
He
had
promised
himself
he
would
stop
in
the
hotel
lobby
for
a
cafe
au
lait
to
clear
his
thoughts,
but
instead
his
legs
carried
him
directly
out
the
front
door
into
the
gathering
Paris
night.
Walking
east
on
Rue
des
Petits
Champs,
Langdon
felt
a
growing
excitement.
He
turned
south
onto
Rue
Richelieu,
where
the
air
grew
sweet
with
the
scent
of
blossoming
jasmine
from
the
stately
gardens
of
the
Palais
Royal.
He
continued
south
until
he
saw
what
he
was
looking
for
the
famous
royal
arcade
a
glistening
expanse
of
polished
black
marble.
Moving
onto
it,
Langdon
scanned
the
surface
beneath
his
feet.
Within
seconds,
he
found
what
he
knew
was
there
several
bronze
medallions
embedded
in
the
ground
in
a
perfectly
straight
line.
Each
disk
was
five
inches
in
diameter
and
embossed
with
the
letters
N
and
S.
Nord.
Sud.
He
turned
due
south,
letting
his
eye
trace
the
extended
line
formed
by
the
medallions.
He
began
moving
again,
following
the
trail,
watching
the
pavement
as
he
walked.
As
he
cut
across
the
corner
of
the
Comedie
Francaise,
another
bronze
medallion
passed
beneath
his
feet.
Yes!
The
streets
of
Paris,
Langdon
had
learned
years
ago,
were
adorned
with
135
of
these
bronze
markers,
embedded
in
sidewalks,
courtyards,
and
streets,
on
a
north
south
axis
across
the
city.
He
had
once
followed
the
line
from
Sacre
Coeur,
north
across
the
Seine,
and
finally
to
the
ancient
Paris
Observatory.
There
he
discovered
the
significance
of
the
sacred
path
it
traced.
The
earth's
original
prime
meridian.
The
first
zero
longitude
of
the
world.
Paris
's
ancient
Rose
Line.
Now,
as
Langdon
hurried
across
Rue
de
Rivoli,
he
could
feel
his
destination
within
reach.
Less
than
a
block
away.
The
Holy
Grail
'neath
ancient
Roslin
waits.
The
revelations
were
coming
now
in
waves.
Sauniere's
ancient
spelling
of
Roslin
the
blade
and
chalice
the
tomb
adorned
with
masters'
art.
Is
that
why
Sauniere
needed
to
talk
with
me
?
Had
I
unknowingly
guessed
the
truth
?
He
broke
into
a
jog,
feeling
the
Rose
Line
beneath
his
feet,
guiding
him,
pulling
him
toward
his
destination.
As
he
entered
the
long
tunnel
of
Passage
Richelieu,
the
hairs
on
his
neck
began
to
bristle
with
anticipation.
He
knew
that
at
the
end
of
this
tunnel
stood
the
most
mysterious
of
Parisian
monuments
conceived
and
commissioned
in
the
1980s
by
the
Sphinx
himself,
Francois
Mitterrand,
a
man
rumored
to
move
in
secret
circles,
a
man
whose
final
legacy
to
Paris
was
a
place
Langdon
had
visited
only
days
before.
Another
lifetime.
With
a
final
surge
of
energy,
Langdon
burst
from
the
passageway
into
the
familiar
courtyard
and
came
to
a
stop.
Breathless,
he
raised
his
eyes,
slowly,
disbelieving,
to
the
glistening
structure
in
front
of
him.
The
Louvre
Pyramid.
Gleaming
in
the
darkness.
He
admired
it
only
a
moment.
He
was
more
interested
in
what
lay
to
his
right.
Turning,
he
felt
his
feet
again
tracing
the
invisible
path
of
the
ancient
Rose
Line,
carrying
him
across
the
courtyard
to
the
Carrousel
du
Louvre
the
enormous
circle
of
grass
surrounded
by
a
perimeter
of
neatly
trimmed
hedges
once
the
site
of
Paris's
primeval
nature
worshipping
festivals
joyous
rites
to
celebrate
fertility
and
the
Goddess.
Langdon
felt
as
if
he
were
crossing
into
another
world
as
he
stepped
over
the
bushes
to
the
grassy
area
within.
This
hallowed
ground
was
now
marked
by
one
of
the
city's
most
unusual
monuments.
There
in
the
center,
plunging
into
the
earth
like
a
crystal
chasm,
gaped
the
giant
inverted
pyramid
of
glass
that
he
had
seen
a
few
nights
ago
when
he
entered
the
Louvre's
subterranean
entresol.
La
Pyramide
Inversee.
Tremulous,
Langdon
walked
to
the
edge
and
peered
down
into
the
Louvre's
sprawling
underground
complex,
aglow
with
amber
light.
His
eye
was
trained
not
just
on
the
massive
inverted
pyramid,
but
on
what
lay
directly
beneath
it.
There,
on
the
floor
of
the
chamber
below,
stood
the
tiniest
of
structures
a
structure
Langdon
had
mentioned
in
his
manuscript.
Langdon
felt
himself
awaken
fully
now
to
the
thrill
of
unthinkable
possibility.
Raising
his
eyes
again
to
the
Louvre,
he
sensed
the
huge
wings
of
the
museum
enveloping
him
hallways
that
burgeoned
with
the
world's
finest
art.
Da
Vinci
Botticelli
Adorned
in
masters'
loving
art,
She
lies.
Alive
with
wonder,
he
stared
once
again
downward
through
the
glass
at
the
tiny
structure
below.
must
go
down
there!
Stepping
out
of
the
circle,
he
hurried
across
the
courtyard
back
toward
the
towering
pyramid
entrance
of
the
Louvre.
The
day's
last
visitors
were
trickling
out
of
the
museum.
Pushing
through
the
revolving
door,
Langdon
descended
the
curved
staircase
into
the
pyramid.
He
could
feel
the
air
grow
cooler.
When
he
reached
the
bottom,
he
entered
the
long
tunnel
that
stretched
beneath
the
Louvre's
courtyard,
back
toward
La
Pyramide
Inversee.
At
the
end
of
the
tunnel,
he
emerged
into
a
large
chamber.
Directly
before
him,
hanging
down
from
above,
gleamed
the
inverted
pyramid
a
breathtaking
V
shaped
contour
of
glass.
The
Chalice.
Langdon's
eyes
traced
its
narrowing
form
downward
to
its
tip,
suspended
only
six
feet
above
the
floor.
There,
directly
beneath
it,
stood
the
tiny
structure.
A
miniature
pyramid.
Only
three
feet
tall.
The
only
structure
in
this
colossal
complex
that
had
been
built
on
a
small
scale.
Langdon's
manuscript,
while
discussing
the
Louvre's
elaborate
collection
of
goddess
art,
had
made
passing
note
of
this
modest
pyramid.
"The
miniature
structure
itself
protrudes
up
through
the
floor
as
though
it
were
the
tip
of
an
iceberg
the
apex,
of
an
enormous,
pyramidical
vault,
submerged
below
like
a
hidden
chamber.
Illuminated
in
the
soft
lights
of
the
deserted
entresol,
the
two
pyramids
pointed
at
one
another,
their
bodies
perfectly
aligned,
their
tips
almost
touching.
The
Chalice
above.
The
Blade
below.
The
blade
and
chalice
guarding
o'er
Her
gates.
Langdon
heard
Marie
Chauvel's
words.
One
day
it
will
dawn
on
you.
He
was
standing
beneath
the
ancient
Rose
Line,
surrounded
by
the
work
of
masters.
What
better
place
for
Sauniere
to
keep
watch?
Now
at
last,
he
sensed
he
understood
the
true
meaning
of
the
Grand
Master's
verse.
Raising
his
eyes
to
heaven,
he
gazed
upward
through
the
glass
to
a
glorious,
star
filled
night.
She
rests
at
last
beneath
the
starry
skies.
Like
the
murmurs
of
spirits
in
the
darkness,
forgotten
words
echoed.
The
quest
for
the
Holy
Grail
is
the
quest
to
kneel
before
the
bones
of
Mary
Magdalene.
A
journey
to
pray
at
the
feet
of
the
outcast
one.
With
a
sudden
upwelling
of
reverence,
Robert
Langdon
fell
to
his
knees.
For
a
moment,
he
thought
he
heard
a
woman's
voice
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
whispering
up
from
the
chasms
of
the
