Robert
Langdon
awoke
slowly.
A
telephone
was
ringing
in
the
darkness
a
tinny,
unfamiliar
ring.
He
fumbled
for
the
bedside
lamp
and
turned
it
on.
Squinting
at
his
surroundings
he
saw
a
plush
Renaissance
bedroom
with
Louis
XVI
furniture,
hand
frescoed
walls,
and
a
colossal
mahogany
four
poster
bed.
Where
the
hell
am
I?
The
jacquard
bathrobe
hanging
on
his
bedpost
bore
the
monogram:
HOTEL
RITZ
PARIS.
Slowly,
the
fog
began
to
lift.
Langdon
picked
up
the
receiver.
"Hello?"
"Monsieur
Langdon?"
a
man's
voice
said.
"I
hope
I
have
not
awoken
you?"
Dazed,
Langdon
looked
at
the
bedside
clock.
It
was
12:32
A.M.
He
had
been
asleep
only
an
hour,
but
he
felt
like
the
dead.
"This
is
the
concierge,
monsieur.
I
apologize
for
this
intrusion,
but
you
have
a
visitor.
He
insists
it
is
urgent."
Langdon
still
felt
fuzzy.
A
visitor?
His
eyes
focused
now
on
a
crumpled
flyer
on
his
bedside
table.
THE
AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY
OF
PARIS
proudly
presents
AN
EVENING
WITH
ROBERT
LANGDON
PROFESSOR
OF
RELIGIOUS
SYMBOLOGY,
HARVARD
UNIVERSITY
Langdon
groaned.
Tonight's
lecture
a
slide
show
about
pagan
symbolism
hidden
in
the
stones
of
Chartres
Cathedral
had
probably
ruffled
some
conservative
feathers
in
the
audience.
Most
likely,
some
religious
scholar
had
trailed
him
home
to
pick
a
fight.
"I'm
sorry,"
Langdon
said,
"but
I'm
very
tired
and
"Mais,
monsieur,
"
the
concierge
pressed,
lowering
his
voice
to
an
urgent
whisper.
"Your
guest
is
an
important
man."
Langdon
had
little
doubt.
His
books
on
religious
paintings
and
cult
symbology
had
made
him
a
reluctant
celebrity
in
the
art
world,
and
last
year
Langdon's
visibility
had
increased
a
hundredfold
after
his
involvement
in
a
widely
publicized
incident
at
the
Vatican.
Since
then,
the
stream
of
self
important
historians
and
art
buffs
arriving
at
his
door
had
seemed
never
ending.
"If
you
would
be
so
kind,"
Langdon
said,
doing
his
best
to
remain
polite,
"could
you
take
the
man's
name
and
number,
and
tell
him
I'll
try
to
call
him
before
I
leave
Paris
on
Tuesday?
Thank
you."
He
hung
up
before
the
concierge
could
protest.
Sitting
up
now,
Langdon
frowned
at
his
bedside
Guest
Relations
Handbook,
whose
cover
boasted:
SLEEP
LIKE
A
BABY
IN
THE
CITY
OF
LIGHTS.
SLUMBER
AT
THE
PARIS
RITZ.
He
turned
and
gazed
tiredly
into
the
full
length
mirror
across
the
room.
The
man
staring
back
at
him
was
a
stranger
tousled
and
weary.
You
need
a
vacation,
Robert.
The
past
year
had
taken
a
heavy
toll
on
him,
but
he
didn't
appreciate
seeing
proof
in
the
mirror.
His
usually
sharp
blue
eyes
looked
hazy
and
drawn
tonight.
A
dark
stubble
was
shrouding
his
strong
jaw
and
dimpled
chin.
Around
his
temples,
the
gray
highlights
were
advancing,
making
their
way
deeper
into
his
thicket
of
coarse
black
hair.
Although
his
female
colleagues
insisted
the
gray
only
accentuated
his
bookish
appeal,
Langdon
knew
better.
"Boston
Magazine
could
see
me
now.
Last
month,
much
to
Langdon's
embarrassment,
Boston
Magazine
had
listed
him
as
one
of
that
city's
top
ten
most
intriguing
people
a
dubious
honor
that
made
him
the
brunt
of
endless
ribbing
by
his
Harvard
colleagues.
Tonight,
three
thousand
miles
from
home,
the
accolade
had
resurfaced
to
haunt
him
at
the
lecture
he
had
given.
"Ladies
and
gentlemen"
the
hostess
had
announced
to
a
full
house
at
the
American
University
of
Paris's
Pavilion
Dauphine,
"Our
guest
tonight
needs
no
introduction.
He
is
the
author
of
numerous
books:
The
Symbology
of
Secret
Sects,
The
An
of
the
Illuminati,
The
Lost
Language
of
Ideograms,
and
when
I
say
he
wrote
the
book
on
Religious
Iconology,
I
mean
that
quite
literally.
Many
of
you
use
his
textbooks
in
class."
The
students
in
the
crowd
nodded
enthusiastically.
"I
had
planned
to
introduce
him
tonight
by
sharing
his
impressive
curriculum
vitae.
However"
She
glanced
playfully
at
Langdon,
who
was
seated
onstage.
"An
audience
member
has
just
handed
me
a
far
more,
shall
we
say
intriguing
introduction."
She
held
up
a
copy
of
Boston
Magazine.
Langdon
cringed.
Where
the
hell
did
she
get
that?
The
hostess
began
reading
choice
excerpts
from
the
inane
article,
and
Langdon
felt
himself
sinking
lower
and
lower
in
his
chair.
Thirty
seconds
later,
the
crowd
was
grinning,
and
the
woman
showed
no
signs
of
letting
up.
"And
Mr.
Langdon's
refusal
to
speak
publicly
about
his
unusual
role
in
last
year's
Vatican
conclave
certainly
wins
him
points
on
our
intrigue
o
meter."
The
hostess
goaded
the
crowd.
"Would
you
like
to
hear
more?"
The
crowd
applauded.
Somebody
stop
her,
Langdon
pleaded
as
she
dove
into
the
article
again.
"Although
Professor
Langdon
might
not
be
considered
hunk
handsome
like
some
of
our
younger
awardees,
this
forty
something
academic
has
more
than
his
share
of
scholarly
allure.
His
captivating
presence
is
punctuated
by
an
unusually
low,
baritone
speaking
voice,
which
his
female
students
describe
as
'chocolate
for
the
ears.'
The
hall
erupted
in
laughter.
Langdon
forced
an
awkward
smile.
He
knew
what
came
next
some
ridiculous
line
about
"Harrison
Ford
in
Harris
tweed"
and
because
this
evening
he
had
figured
it
was
finally
safe
again
to
wear
his
Harris
tweed
and
Burberry
turtleneck,
he
decided
to
take
action.
"Thank
you,
Monique,"
Langdon
said,
standing
prematurely
and
edging
her
away
from
the
podium.
"Boston
Magazine
clearly
has
a
gift
for
fiction."
He
turned
to
the
audience
with
an
embarrassed
sigh.
"And
if
I
find
which
one
of
you
provided
that
article,
I'll
have
the
consulate
deport
you."
The
crowd
laughed.
"Well,
folks,
as
you
all
know,
I'm
here
tonight
to
talk
about
the
power
of
symbols"
The
ringing
of
Langdon's
hotel
phone
once
again
broke
the
silence.
Groaning
in
disbelief,
he
picked
up.
"Yes?"
As
expected,
it
was
the
concierge.
"Mr.
Langdon,
again
my
apologies.
I
am
calling
to
inform
you
that
your
guest
is
now
en
route
to
your
room.
I
thought
I
should
alert
you."
Langdon
was
wide
awake
now.
"You
sent
someone
to
my
room?"
"I
apologize,
monsieur,
but
a
man
like
this
I
cannot
presume
the
authority
to
stop
him."
"Who
exactly
is
he?"
But
the
concierge
was
gone.
Almost
immediately,
a
heavy
fist
pounded
on
Langdon's
door.
Uncertain,
Langdon
slid
off
the
bed,
feeling
his
toes
sink
deep
into
the
savonniere
carpet.
He
donned
the
hotel
bathrobe
and
moved
toward
the
door.
"Who
is
it?"
"Mr.
Langdon?
I
need
to
speak
with
you."
The
man's
English
was
accented
a
sharp,
authoritative
bark.
"My
name
is
Lieutenant
Jerome
Collet.
Direction
Centrale
Police
Judiciaire."
Langdon
paused.
The
Judicial
Police?
The
DCPJ
was
the
rough
equivalent
of
the
U.S.
FBI.
Leaving
the
security
chain
in
place,
Langdon
opened
the
door
a
few
inches.
The
face
staring
back
at
him
was
thin
and
washed
out.
The
man
was
exceptionally
lean,
dressed
in
an
official
looking
blue
uniform.
"May
I
come
in?"
the
agent
asked.
Langdon
hesitated,
feeling
uncertain
as
the
stranger's
sallow
eyes
studied
him.
"What
is
this
all
about?"
"My
capitaine
requires
your
expertise
in
a
private
matter."
"Now?"
Langdon
managed.
"It's
after
midnight."
"Am
I
correct
that
you
were
scheduled
to
meet
with
the
curator
of
the
Louvre
this
evening?"
Langdon
felt
a
sudden
surge
of
uneasiness.
He
and
the
revered
curator
Jacques
Sauniere
had
been
slated
to
meet
for
drinks
after
Langdon's
lecture
tonight,
but
Sauniere
had
never
shown
up.
"Yes.
How
did
you
know
that?"
"We
found
your
name
in
his
daily
planner."
"I
trust
nothing
is
wrong?"
The
agent
gave
a
dire
sigh
and
slid
a
Polaroid
snapshot
through
the
narrow
opening
in
the
door.
When
Langdon
saw
the
photo,
his
entire
body
went
rigid.
"This
photo
was
taken
less
than
an
hour
ago.
Inside
the
Louvre."
As
Langdon
stared
at
the
bizarre
image,
his
initial
revulsion
and
shock
gave
way
to
a
sudden
upwelling
of
anger.
"Who
would
do
this!"
"We
had
hoped
that
you
might
help
us
answer
that
very
question,
considering
your
knowledge
in
symbology
and
your
plans
to
meet
with
him."
Langdon
stared
at
the
picture,
his
horror
now
laced
with
fear.
The
image
was
gruesome
and
profoundly
strange,
bringing
with
it
an
unsettling
sense
of
deja
vu.
A
little
over
a
year
ago,
Langdon
had
received
a
photograph
of
a
corpse
and
a
similar
request
for
help.
Twenty
four
hours
later,
he
had
almost
lost
his
life
inside
Vatican
City.
This
photo
was
entirely
different,
and
yet
something
about
the
scenario
felt
disquietingly
familiar.
The
agent
checked
his
watch.
"My
capitaine
is
waiting,
sir."
Langdon
barely
heard
him.
His
eyes
were
still
riveted
on
the
picture.
"This
symbol
here,
and
the
way
his
body
is
so
oddly"
"Positioned?"
the
agent
offered.
Langdon
nodded,
feeling
a
chill
as
he
looked
up.
"I
can't
imagine
who
would
do
this
to
someone."
The
agent
looked
grim.
"You
don't
understand,
Mr.
Langdon.
What
you
see
in
this
photograph"
He
paused.
"Monsieur
Sauniere
did
that
to
himself."
One
mile
away,
the
hulking
albino
named
Silas
limped
through
the
front
gate
of
the
luxurious
brownstone
residence
on
Rue
La
Bruyere.
The
spiked
cilice
belt
that
he
wore
around
his
thigh
cut
into
his
flesh,
and
yet
his
soul
sang
with
satisfaction
of
service
to
the
Lord.
Pain
is
good.
His
red
eyes
scanned
the
lobby
as
he
entered
the
residence.
Empty.
He
climbed
the
stairs
quietly,
not
wanting
to
awaken
any
of
his
fellow
numeraries.
His
bedroom
door
was
open;
locks
were
forbidden
here.
He
entered,
closing
the
door
behind
him.
The
room
was
spartan
hardwood
floors,
a
pine
dresser,
a
canvas
mat
in
the
corner
that
served
as
his
bed.
He
was
a
visitor
here
this
week,
and
yet
for
many
years
he
had
been
blessed
with
a
similar
sanctuary
in
New
York
City.
The
Lord
has
provided
me
shelter
and
purpose
in
my
life.
Tonight,
at
last,
Silas
felt
he
had
begun
to
repay
his
debt.
Hurrying
to
the
dresser,
he
found
the
cell
phone
hidden
in
his
bottom
drawer
and
placed
a
call.
"Yes?"
a
male
voice
answered.
"Teacher,
I
have
returned."
"Speak,"
the
voice
commanded,
sounding
pleased
to
hear
from
him.
"All
four
are
gone.
The
three
senechaux
and
the
Grand
Master
himself."
There
was
a
momentary
pause,
as
if
for
prayer.
"Then
I
assume
you
have
the
information?"
"All
four
concurred.
Independently."
"And
you
believed
them?"
"Their
agreement
was
too
great
for
coincidence."
An
excited
breath.
"Excellent.
I
had
feared
the
brotherhood's
reputation
for
secrecy
might
prevail."
"The
prospect
of
death
is
strong
motivation."
"So,
my
pupil,
tell
me
what
I
must
know."
Silas
knew
the
information
he
had
gleaned
from
his
victims
would
come
as
a
shock.
"Teacher,
all
four
confirmed
the
existence
of
the
clef
de
voiite
the
legendary
keystone.
He
heard
a
quick
intake
of
breath
over
the
phone
and
could
feel
the
Teacher's
excitement.
"The
keystone.
Exactly
as
we
suspected."
According
to
lore,
the
brotherhood
had
created
a
map
of
stone
a
clef
de
voiite
or
keystone
an
engraved
tablet
that
revealed
the
final
resting
place
of
the
brotherhood's
greatest
secret
information
so
powerful
that
its
protection
was
the
reason
for
the
brotherhood's
very
existence.
"When
we
possess
the
keystone,"
the
Teacher
said,
"we
will
be
only
one
step
away."
"We
are
closer
than
you
think.
The
keystone
is
here
in
Paris."
"Paris?
Incredible.
It
is
almost
too
easy."
Silas
relayed
the
earlier
events
of
the
evening
how
all
four
of
his
victims,
moments
before
death,
had
desperately
tried
to
buy
back
their
godless
lives
by
telling
their
secret.
Each
had
told
Silas
the
exact
same
thing
that
the
keystone
was
ingeniously
hidden
at
a
precise
location
inside
one
of
Paris's
ancient
churches
the
Eglise
de
SaintSulpice.
"Inside
a
house
of
the
Lord,"
the
Teacher
exclaimed.
"How
they
mock
us!"
"As
they
have
for
centuries."
The
Teacher
fell
silent,
as
if
letting
the
triumph
of
this
moment
settle
over
him.
Finally,
he
spoke.
"You
have
done
a
great
service
to
God.
We
have
waited
centuries
for
this.
You
must
retrieve
the
stone
for
me.
Immediately.
Tonight.
You
understand
the
stakes."
Silas
knew
the
stakes
were
incalculable,
and
yet
what
the
Teacher
was
now
commanding
seemed
impossible.
"But
the
church,
it
is
a
fortress.
Especially
at
night.
How
will
I
enter?"
With
the
confident
tone
of
a
man
of
enormous
influence,
the
Teacher
explained
what
was
to
be
done.
When
Silas
hung
up
the
phone,
his
skin
tingled
with
anticipation.
One
hour,
he
told
himself,
grateful
that
the
Teacher
had
given
him
time
to
carry
out
the
necessary
penance
before
entering
a
house
of
God.
must
purge
my
soul
of
today's
sins.
The
sins
committed
today
had
been
holy
in
purpose.
Acts
of
war
against
the
enemies
of
God
had
been
committed
for
centuries.
Forgiveness
was
assured.
Even
so,
Silas
knew,
absolution
required
sacrifice.
Pulling
his
shades,
he
stripped
naked
and
knelt
in
the
center
of
his
room.
Looking
down,
he
examined
the
spiked
cilice
belt
clamped
around
his
thigh.
All
true
followers
of
The
Way
wore
this
device
a
leather
strap,
studded
with
sharp
metal
barbs
that
cut
into
the
flesh
as
a
perpetual
reminder
of
Christ's
suffering.
The
pain
caused
by
the
device
also
helped
counteract
the
desires
of
the
flesh.
Although
Silas
already
had
worn
his
cilice
today
longer
than
the
requisite
two
hours,
he
knew
today
was
no
ordinary
day.
Grasping
the
buckle,
he
cinched
it
one
notch
tighter,
wincing
as
the
barbs
dug
deeper
into
his
flesh.
Exhaling
slowly,
he
savored
the
cleansing
ritual
of
his
pain.
Pain
is
good,
Silas
whispered,
repeating
the
sacred
mantra
of
Father
Josemaria
Escriva
the
Teacher
of
all
Teachers.
Although
Escriva
had
died
in
1975,
his
wisdom
lived
on,
his
words
still
whispered
by
thousands
of
faithful
servants
around
the
globe
as
they
knelt
on
the
floor
and
performed
the
sacred
practice
known
as
"corporal
mortification."
Silas
turned
his
attention
now
to
a
heavy
knotted
rope
coiled
neatly
on
the
floor
beside
him.
The
Discipline.
The
knots
were
caked
with
dried
blood.
Eager
for
the
purifying
effects
of
his
own
agony,
Silas
said
a
quick
prayer.
Then,
gripping
one
end
of
the
rope,
he
closed
his
eyes
and
swung
it
hard
over
his
shoulder,
feeling
the
knots
slap
against
his
back.
He
whipped
it
over
his
shoulder
again,
slashing
at
his
flesh.
Again
and
again,
he
lashed.
Castigo
corpus
meum.
Finally,
he
felt
the
blood
begin
to
flow.
The
crisp
April
air
whipped
through
the
open
window
of
the
Citroen
ZX
as
it
skimmed
south
past
the
Opera
House
and
crossed
Place
Vendome.
In
the
passenger
seat,
Robert
Langdon
felt
the
city
tear
past
him
as
he
tried
to
clear
his
thoughts.
His
quick
shower
and
shave
had
left
him
looking
reasonably
presentable
but
had
done
little
to
ease
his
anxiety.
The
frightening
image
of
the
curator's
body
remained
locked
in
his
mind.
Jacques
Sauniere
is
dead.
Langdon
could
not
help
but
feel
a
deep
sense
of
loss
at
the
curator's
death.
Despite
Sauniere's
reputation
for
being
reclusive,
his
recognition
for
dedication
to
the
arts
made
him
an
easy
man
to
revere.
His
books
on
the
secret
codes
hidden
in
the
paintings
of
Poussin
and
Teniers
were
some
of
Langdon's

Tonight's
meeting
had
been
one
Langdon
was
very
much
looking
forward
to,
and
he
was
disappointed
when
the
curator
had
not
shown.
Again
the
image
of
the
curator's
body
flashed
in
his
mind.
Jacques
Sauniere
did
that
to
himself?
Langdon
turned
and
looked
out
the
window,
forcing
the
picture
from
his
mind.
Outside,
the
city
was
just
now
winding
down
street
vendors
wheeling
carts
of
candied
amandes,
waiters
carrying
bags
of
garbage
to
the
curb,
a
pair
of
late
night
lovers
cuddling
to
stay
warm
in
a
breeze
scented
with
jasmine
blossom.
The
Citroen
navigated
the
chaos
with
authority,
its
dissonant
two
tone
siren
parting
the
traffic
like
a
knife.
"he
capitaine
was
pleased
to
discover
you
were
still
in
Paris
tonight,"
the
agent
said,
speaking
for
the
first
time
since
they'd
left
the
hotel.
"A
fortunate
coincidence."
Langdon
was
feeling
anything
but
fortunate,
and
coincidence
was
a
concept
he
did
not
entirely
trust.
As
someone
who
had
spent
his
life
exploring
the
hidden
interconnectivity
of
disparate
emblems
and
ideologies,
Langdon
viewed
the
world
as
a
web
of
profoundly
intertwined
histories
and
events.
The
connections
may
be
invisible,
he
often
preached
to
his
symbology
classes
at
Harvard,
but
they
are
always
there,
buried
just
beneath
the
surface.
"I
assume,"
Langdon
said,
"that
the
American
University
of
Paris
told
you
where
I
was
staying?"
The
driver
shook
his
head.
"Interpol."
Interpol,
Langdon
thought.
Of
course.
He
had
forgotten
that
the
seemingly
innocuous
request
of
all
European
hotels
to
see
a
passport
at
check
in
was
more
than
a
quaint
formality
it
was
the
law.
On
any
given
night,
all
across
Europe,
Interpol
officials
could
pinpoint
exactly
who
was
sleeping
where.
Finding
Langdon
at
the
Ritz
had
probably
taken
all
of
five
seconds.
As
the
Citroen
accelerated
southward
across
the
city,
the
illuminated
profile
of
the
Eiffel
Tower
appeared,
shooting
skyward
in
the
distance
to
the
right.
Seeing
it,
Langdon
thought
of
Vittoria,
recalling
their
playful
promise
a
year
ago
that
every
six
months
they
would
meet
again
at
a
different
romantic
spot
on
the
globe.
The
Eiffel
Tower,
Langdon
suspected,
would
have
made
their
list.
Sadly,
he
last
kissed
Vittoria
in
a
noisy
airport
in
Rome
more
than
a
year
ago.
"Did
you
mount
her?"
the
agent
asked,
looking
over.
Langdon
glanced
up,
certain
he
had
misunderstood.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"She
is
lovely,
no?"
The
agent
motioned
through
the
windshield
toward
the
Eiffel
Tower.
"Have
you
mounted
her?"
Langdon
rolled
his
eyes.
"No,
I
haven't
climbed
the
tower."
"She
is
the
symbol
of
France.
I
think
she
is
perfect."
Langdon
nodded
absently.
Symbologists
often
remarked
that
France
a
country
renowned
for
machismo,
womanizing,
and
diminutive
insecure
leaders
like
Napoleon
and
Pepin
the
Short
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
apt
national
emblem
than
a
thousand
foot
phallus.
When
they
reached
the
intersection
at
Rue
de
Rivoli,
the
traffic
light
was
red,
but
the
Citroen
didn't
slow.
The
agent
gunned
the
sedan
across
the
junction
and
sped
onto
a
wooded
section
of
Rue
Castiglione,
which
served
as
the
northern
entrance
to
the
famed
Tuileries
Gardens
Paris's
own
version
of
Central
Park.
Most
tourists
mistranslated
Jardins
des
Tuileries
as
relating
to
the
thousands
of
tulips
that
bloomed
here,
but
Tuileries
was
actually
a
literal
reference
to
something
far
less
romantic.
This
park
had
once
been
an
enormous,
polluted
excavation
pit
from
which
Parisian
contractors
mined
clay
to
manufacture
the
city's
famous
red
roofing
tiles
or
tuiles.
As
they
entered
the
deserted
park,
the
agent
reached
under
the
dash
and
turned
off
the
blaring
siren.
Langdon
exhaled,
savoring
the
sudden
quiet.
Outside
the
car,
the
pale
wash
of
halogen
headlights
skimmed
over
the
crushed
gravel
parkway,
the
rugged
whir
of
the
tires
intoning
a
hypnotic
rhythm.
Langdon
had
always
considered
the
Tuileries
to
be
sacred
ground.
These
were
the
gardens
in
which
Claude
Monet
had
experimented
with
form
and
color,
and
literally
inspired
the
birth
of
the
Impressionist
movement.
Tonight,
however,
this
place
held
a
strange
aura
of
foreboding.
The
Citroen
swerved
left
now,
angling
west
down
the
park's
central
boulevard.
Curling
around
a
circular
pond,
the
driver
cut
across
a
desolate
avenue
out
into
a
wide
quadrangle
beyond.
Langdon
could
now
see
the
end
of
the
Tuileries
Gardens,
marked
by
a
giant
stone
archway.
Arc
du
Carrousel.
Despite
the
orgiastic
rituals
once
held
at
the
Arc
du
Carrousel,
art
aficionados
revered
this
place
for
another
reason
entirely.
From
the
esplanade
at
the
end
of
the
Tuileries,
four
of
the
finest
art
museums
in
the
world
could
be
seen
one
at
each
point
of
the
compass.
Out
the
right
hand
window,
south
across
the
Seine
and
Quai
Voltaire,
Langdon
could
see
the
dramatically
lit
facade
of
the
old
train
station
now
the
esteemed
Musee
d'Orsay.
Glancing
left,
he
could
make
out
the
top
of
the
ultramodern
Pompidou
Center,
which
housed
the
Museum
of
Modern
Art.
Behind
him
to
the
west,
Langdon
knew
the
ancient
obelisk
of
Ramses
rose
above
the
trees,
marking
the
Musee
du
Jeu
de
Paume.
But
it
was
straight
ahead,
to
the
east,
through
the
archway,
that
Langdon
could
now
see
the
monolithic
Renaissance
palace
that
had
become
the
most
famous
art
museum
in
the
world.
Musee
du
Louvre.
Langdon
felt
a
familiar
tinge
of
wonder
as
his
eyes
made
a
futile
attempt
to
absorb
the
entire
mass
of
the
edifice.
Across
a
staggeringly
expansive
plaza,
the
imposing
facade
of
the
Louvre
rose
like
a
citadel
against
the
Paris
sky.
Shaped
like
an
enormous
horseshoe,
the
Louvre
was
the
longest
building
in
Europe,
stretching
farther
than
three
Eiffel
Towers
laid
end
to
end.
Not
even
the
million
square
feet
of
open
plaza
between
the
museum
wings
could
challenge
the
majesty
of
the
facade's
breadth.
Langdon
had
once
walked
the
Louvre's
entire
perimeter,
an
astonishing
three
mile
journey.
Despite
the
estimated
five
days
it
would
take
a
visitor
to
properly
appreciate
the
65,300
pieces
of
art
in
this
building,
most
tourists
chose
an
abbreviated
experience
Langdon
referred
to
as
"Louvre
Lite"
a
full
sprint
through
the
museum
to
see
the
three
most
famous
objects:
the
Mona
Lisa,
Venus
de
Milo,
and
Winged
Victory.
Art
Buchwald
had
once
boasted
he'd
seen
all
three
masterpieces
in
five
minutes
and
fifty
six
seconds.
The
driver
pulled
out
a
handheld
walkie
talkie
and
spoke
in
rapid
fire
French.
"Monsieur
Langdon
est
arrive.
Deux
minutes.
An
indecipherable
confirmation
came
crackling
back.
The
agent
stowed
the
device,
turning
now
to
Langdon.
"You
will
meet
the
capitaine
at
the
main
entrance."
The
driver
ignored
the
signs
prohibiting
auto
traffic
on
the
plaza,
revved
the
engine,
and
gunned
the
Citroen
up
over
the
curb.
The
Louvre's
main
entrance
was
visible
now,
rising
boldly
in
the
distance,
encircled
by
seven
triangular
pools
from
which
spouted
illuminated
fountains.
La
Pyramide.
The
new
entrance
to
the
Paris
Louvre
had
become
almost
as
famous
as
the
museum
itself.
The
controversial,
neomodern
glass
pyramid
designed
by
Chinese
born
American
architect
I.
M.
Pei
still
evoked
scorn
from
traditionalists
who
felt
it
destroyed
the
dignity
of
the
Renaissance
courtyard.
Goethe
had
described
architecture
as
frozen
music,
and
Pei's
critics
described
this
pyramid
as
fingernails
on
a
chalkboard.
Progressive
admirers,
though,
hailed
Pei's
seventy
one
foot
tall
transparent
pyramid
as
a
dazzling
synergy
of
ancient
structure
and
modern
method
a
symbolic
link
between
the
old
and
new
helping
usher
the
Louvre
into
the
next
millennium.
"Do
you
like
our
pyramid?"
the
agent
asked.
Langdon
frowned.
The
French,
it
seemed,
loved
to
ask
Americans
this.
It
was
a
loaded
question,
of
course.
Admitting
you
liked
the
pyramid
made
you
a
tasteless
American,
and
expressing
dislike
was
an
insult
to
the
French.
"Mitterrand
was
a
bold
man,"
Langdon
replied,
splitting
the
difference.
The
late
French
president
who
had
commissioned
the
pyramid
was
said
to
have
suffered
from
a
"Pharaoh
complex."
Singlehandedly
responsible
for
filling
Paris
with
Egyptian
obelisks,
art,
and
artifacts.
Francois
Mitterrand
had
an
affinity
for
Egyptian
culture
that
was
so
all
consuming
that
the
French
still
referred
to
him
as
the
Sphinx.
"What
is
the
captain's
name?"
Langdon
asked,
changing
topics.
"Bezu
Fache,"
the
driver
said,
approaching
the
pyramid's
main
entrance.
"We
call
him
le
Taureau.
Langdon
glanced
over
at
him,
wondering
if
every
Frenchman
had
a
mysterious
animal
epithet.
"You
call
your
captain
the
Bull?"
The
man
arched
his
eyebrows.
"Your
French
is
better
than
you
admit,
Monsieur
Langdon."
My
French
stinks,
Langdon
thought,
but
my
zodiac
iconography
is
pretty
good.
Taurus
was
always
the
bull.
Astrology
was
a
symbolic
constant
all
over
the
world.
The
agent
pulled
the
car
to
a
stop
and
pointed
between
two
fountains
to
a
large
door
in
the
side
of
the
pyramid.
"There
is
the
entrance.
Good
luck,
monsieur."
"You're
not
coming?"
"My
orders
are
to
leave
you
here.
I
have
other
business
to
attend
to."
Langdon
heaved
a
sigh
and
climbed
out.
It's
your
circus.
The
agent
revved
his
engine
and
sped
off.
As
Langdon
stood
alone
and
watched
the
departing
taillights,
he
realized
he
could
easily
reconsider,
exit
the
courtyard,
grab
a
taxi,
and
head
home
to
bed.
Something
told
him
it
was
probably
a
lousy
idea.
As
he
moved
toward
the
mist
of
the
fountains,
Langdon
had
the
uneasy
sense
he
was
crossing
an
imaginary
threshold
into
another
world.
The
dreamlike
quality
of
the
evening
was
settling
around
him
again.
Twenty
minutes
ago
he
had
been
asleep
in
his
hotel
room.
Now
he
was
standing
in
front
of
a
transparent
pyramid
built
by
the
Sphinx,
waiting
for
a
policeman
they
called
the
Bull.
I'm
trapped
in
a
Salvador
Dali
painting,
he
thought.
Langdon
strode
to
the
main
entrance
an
enormous
revolving
door.
The
foyer
beyond
was
dimly
lit
and
deserted.
Do
I
knock?
Langdon
wondered
if
any
of
Harvard's
revered
Egyptologists
had
ever
knocked
on
the
front
door
of
a
pyramid
and
expected
an
answer.
He
raised
his
hand
to
bang
on
the
glass,
but
out
of
the
darkness
below,
a
figure
appeared,
striding
up
the
curving
staircase.
The
man
was
stocky
and
dark,
almost
Neanderthal,
dressed
in
a
dark
double
breasted
suit
that
strained
to
cover
his
wide
shoulders.
He
advanced
with
unmistakable
authority
on
squat,
powerful
legs.
He
was
speaking
on
his
cell
phone
but
finished
the
call
as
he
arrived.
He
motioned
for
Langdon
to
enter.
"I
am
Bezu
Fache,"
he
announced
as
Langdon
pushed
through
the
revolving
door.
"Captain
of
the
Central
Directorate
Judicial
Police."
His
tone
was
fitting
a
guttural
rumble
like
a
gathering
storm.
Langdon
held
out
his
hand
to
shake.
"Robert
Langdon."
Fache's
enormous
palm
wrapped
around
Langdon's
with
crushing
force.
"I
saw
the
photo,"
Langdon
said.
"Your
agent
said
Jacques
Sauniere
himself
did
"Mr.
Langdon,"
Fache's
ebony
eyes
locked
on.
"What
you
see
in
the
photo
is
only
the
beginning
of
what
Sauniere
did."
Captain
Bezu
Fache
carried
himself
like
an
angry
ox,
with
his
wide
shoulders
thrown
back
and
his
chin
tucked
hard
into
his
chest.
His
dark
hair
was
slicked
back
with
oil,
accentuating
an
arrow
like
widow's
peak
that
divided
his
jutting
brow
and
preceded
him
like
the
prow
of
a
battleship.
As
he
advanced,
his
dark
eyes
seemed
to
scorch
the
earth
before
him,
radiating
a
fiery
clarity
that
forecast
his
reputation
for
unblinking
severity
in
all
matters.
Langdon
followed
the
captain
down
the
famous
marble
staircase
into
the
sunken
atrium
beneath
the
glass
pyramid.
As
they
descended,
they
passed
between
two
armed
Judicial
Police
guards
with
machine
guns.
The
message
was
clear:
Nobody
goes
in
or
out
tonight
without
the
blessing
of
Captain
Fache.
Descending
below
ground
level,
Langdon
fought
a
rising
trepidation.
Fache's
presence
was
anything
but
welcoming,
and
the
Louvre
itself
had
an
almost
sepulchral
aura
at
this
hour.
The
staircase,
like
the
aisle
of
a
dark
movie
theater,
was
illuminated
by
subtle
tread
lighting
embedded
in
each
step.
Langdon
could
hear
his
own
footsteps
reverberating
off
the
glass
overhead.
As
he
glanced
up,
he
could
see
the
faint
illuminated
wisps
of
mist
from
the
fountains
fading
away
outside
the
transparent
roof.
"Do
you
approve?"
Fache
asked,
nodding
upward
with
his
broad
chin.
Langdon
sighed,
too
tired
to
play
games.
"Yes,
your
pyramid
is
magnificent."
Fache
grunted.
"A
scar
on
the
face
of
Paris."
Strike
one.
Langdon
sensed
his
host
was
a
hard
man
to
please.
He
wondered
if
Fache
had
any
idea
that
this
pyramid,
at
President
Mitterrand's
explicit
demand,
had
been
constructed
of
exactly
666
panes
of
glass
a
bizarre
request
that
had
always
been
a
hot
topic
among
conspiracy
buffs
who
claimed
666
was
the
number
of
Satan.
Langdon
decided
not
to
bring
it
up.
As
they
dropped
farther
into
the
subterranean
foyer,
the
yawning
space
slowly
emerged
from
the
shadows.
Built
fifty
seven
feet
beneath
ground
level,
the
Louvre's
newly
constructed
70,000
square
foot
lobby
spread
out
like
an
endless
grotto.
Constructed
in
warm
ocher
marble
to
be
compatible
with
the
honey
colored
stone
of
the
Louvre
facade
above,
the
subterranean
hall
was
usually
vibrant
with
sunlight
and
tourists.
Tonight,
however,
the
lobby
was
barren
and
dark,
giving
the
entire
space
a
cold
and
crypt
like
atmosphere.
"And
the
museum's
regular
security
staff?"
Langdon
asked.
"En
quarantaine,
"
Fache
replied,
sounding
as
if
Langdon
were
questioning
the
integrity
of
Fache's
team.
"Obviously,
someone
gained
entry
tonight
who
should
not
have.
All
Louvre
night
wardens
are
in
the
Sully
Wing
being
questioned.
My
own
agents
have
taken
over
museum
security
for
the
evening."
Langdon
nodded,
moving
quickly
to
keep
pace
with
Fache.
"How
well
did
you
know
Jacques
Sauniere?"
the
captain
asked.
"Actually,
not
at
all.
We'd
never
met."
Fache
looked
surprised.
"Your
first
meeting
was
to
be
tonight?"
"Yes.
We'd
planned
to
meet
at
the
American
University
reception
following
my
lecture,
but
he
never
showed
up."
Fache
scribbled
some
notes
in
a
little
book.
As
they
walked,
Langdon
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
Louvre's
lesser
known
pyramid
La
Pyramide
Inversee
a
huge
inverted
skylight
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
like
a
stalactite
in
an
adjoining
section
of
the
entresol.
Fache
guided
Langdon
up
a
short
set
of
stairs
to
the
mouth
of
an
arched
tunnel,
over
which
a
sign
read:
DENON.
The
Denon
Wing
was
the
most
famous
of
the
Louvre's
three
main
sections.
"Who
requested
tonight's
meeting?"
Fache
asked
suddenly.
"You
or
he?"
The
question
seemed
odd.
"Mr.
Sauniere
did,"
Langdon
replied
as
they
entered
the
tunnel.
"His
secretary
contacted
me
a
few
weeks
ago
via
e
mail.
She
said
the
curator
had
heard
I
would
be
lecturing
in
Paris
this
month
and
wanted
to
discuss
something
with
me
while
I
was
here."
"Discuss
what?"
"I
don't
know.
Art,
I
imagine.
We
share
similar
interests."
Fache
looked
skeptical.
"You
have
no
idea
what
your
meeting
was
about?"
Langdon
did
not.
He'd
been
curious
at
the
time
but
had
not
felt
comfortable
demanding
specifics.
The
venerated
Jacques
Sauniere
had
a
renowned
penchant
for
privacy
and
granted
very
few
meetings;
Langdon
was
grateful
simply
for
the
opportunity
to
meet
him.
"Mr.
Langdon,
can
you
at
least
guess
what
our
murder
victim
might
have
wanted
to
discuss
with
you
on
the
night
he
was
killed?
It
might
be
helpful."
The
pointedness
of
the
question
made
Langdon
uncomfortable.
"I
really
can't
imagine.
I
didn't
ask.
I
felt
honored
to
have
been
contacted
at
all.
I'm
an
admirer
of
Mr.
Sauniere's
work.
I
use
his
texts
often
in
my
classes."
Fache
made
note
of
that
fact
in
his
book.
The
two
men
were
now
halfway
up
the
Denon
Wing's
entry
tunnel,
and
Langdon
could
see
the
twin
ascending
escalators
at
the
far
end,
both
motionless.
"So
you
shared
interests
with
him?"
Fache
asked.
"Yes.
In
fact,
I've
spent
much
of
the
last
year
writing
the
draft
for
a
book
that
deals
with
Mr.
Sauniere's
primary
area
of
expertise.
I
was
looking
forward
to
picking
his
brain."
Fache
glanced
up.
"Pardon?"
The
idiom
apparently
didn't
translate.
"I
was
looking
forward
to
learning
his
thoughts
on
the
topic."
"I
see.
And
what
is
the
topic?"
Langdon
hesitated,
uncertain
exactly
how
to
put
it.
"Essentially,
the
manuscript
is
about
the
iconography
of
goddess
worship
the
concept
of
female
sanctity
and
the
art
and
symbols
associated
with
it."
Fache
ran
a
meaty
hand
across
his
hair.
"And
Sauniere
was
knowledgeable
about
this?"
"Nobody
more
so."
"I
see."
Langdon
sensed
Fache
did
not
see
at
all.
Jacques
Sauniere
was
considered
the
premiere
goddess
iconographer
on
earth.
Not
only
did
Sauniere
have
a
personal
passion
for
relics
relating
to
fertility,
goddess
cults,
Wicca,
and
the
sacred
feminine,
but
during
his
twenty
year
tenure
as
curator,
Sauniere
had
helped
the
Louvre
amass
the
largest
collection
of
goddess
art
on
earth
labrys
axes
from
the
priestesses'
oldest
Greek
shrine
in
Delphi,
gold
caducei
wands,
hundreds
of
Tjet
ankhs
resembling
small
standing
angels,
sistrum
rattles
used
in
ancient
Egypt
to
dispel
evil
spirits,
and
an
astonishing
array
of
statues
depicting
Horus
being
nursed
by
the
goddess
Isis.
"Perhaps
Jacques
Sauniere
knew
of
your
manuscript?"
Fache
offered.
"And
he
called
the
meeting
to
offer
his
help
on
your
book."
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"Actually,
nobody
yet
knows
about
my
manuscript.
It's
still
in
draft
form,
and
I
haven't
shown
it
to
anyone
except
my
editor."
Fache
fell
silent.
Langdon
did
not
add
the
reason
he
hadn't
yet
shown
the
manuscript
to
anyone
else.
The
three
hundred
page
draft
tentatively
titled
Symbols
of
the
Lost
Sacred
Feminine
proposed
some
very
unconventional
interpretations
of
established
religious
iconography
which
would
certainly
be
controversial.
Now,
as
Langdon
approached
the
stationary
escalators,
he
paused,
realizing
Fache
was
no
longer
beside
him.
Turning,
Langdon
saw
Fache
standing
several
yards
back
at
a
service
elevator.
"We'll
take
the
elevator,"
Fache
said
as
the
lift
doors
opened.
"As
I'm
sure
you're
aware,
the
gallery
is
quite
a
distance
on
foot.
Although
Langdon
knew
the
elevator
would
expedite
the
long,
two
story
climb
to
the
Denon
Wing,
he
remained
motionless.
"Is
something
wrong?"
Fache
was
holding
the
door,
looking
impatient.
Langdon
exhaled,
turning
a
longing
glance
back
up
the
open
air
escalator.
Nothing's
wrong
at
all,
he
lied
to
himself,
trudging
back
toward
the
elevator.
As
a
boy,
Langdon
had
fallen
down
an
abandoned
well
shaft
and
almost
died
treading
water
in
the
narrow
space
for
hours
before
being
rescued.
Since
then,
he'd
suffered
a
haunting
phobia
of
enclosed
spaces
elevators,
subways,
squash
courts.
The
elevator
is
a
perfectly
safe
machine,
Langdon
continually
told
himself,
never
believing
it.
It's
a
tiny
metal
box
hanging
in
an
enclosed
shaft!
Holding
his
breath,
he
stepped
into
the
lift,
feeling
the
familiar
tingle
of
adrenaline
as
the
doors
slid
shut.
Two
floors.
Ten
seconds.
"You
and
Mr.
Sauniere,"
Fache
said
as
the
lift
began
to
move,
"you
never
spoke
at
all?
Never
corresponded?
Never
sent
each
other
anything
in
the
mail?"
Another
odd
question.
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"No.
Never."
Fache
cocked
his
head,
as
if
making
a
mental
note
of
that
fact.
Saying
nothing,
he
stared
dead
ahead
at
the
chrome
doors.
As
they
ascended,
Langdon
tried
to
focus
on
anything
other
than
the
four
walls
around
him.
In
the
reflection
of
the
shiny
elevator
door,
he
saw
the
captain's
tie
clip
a
silver
crucifix
with
thirteen
embedded
pieces
of
black
onyx.
Langdon
found
it
vaguely
surprising.
The
symbol
was
known
as
a
crux
gemmata
a
cross
bearing
thirteen
gems
a
Christian
ideogram
for
Christ
and
His
twelve
apostles.
Somehow
Langdon
had
not
expected
the
captain
of
the
French
police
to
broadcast
his
religion
so
openly.
Then
again,
this
was
France;
Christianity
was
not
a
religion
here
so
much
as
a
birthright.
"It's
a
crux
gemmata"
Fache
said
suddenly.
Startled,
Langdon
glanced
up
to
find
Fache's
eyes
on
him
in
the
reflection.
The
elevator
jolted
to
a
stop,
and
the
doors
opened.
Langdon
stepped
quickly
out
into
the
hallway,
eager
for
the
wide
open
space
afforded
by
the
famous
high
ceilings
of
the
Louvre
galleries.
The
world
into
which
he
stepped,
however,
was
nothing
like
he
expected.
Surprised,
Langdon
stopped
short.
Fache
glanced
over.
"I
gather,
Mr.
Langdon,
you
have
never
seen
the
Louvre
after
hours?"
guess
not,
Langdon
thought,
trying
to
get
his
bearings.
Usually
impeccably
illuminated,
the
Louvre
galleries
were
startlingly
dark
tonight.
Instead
of
the
customary
flat
white
light
flowing
down
from
above,
a
muted
red
glow
seemed
to
emanate
upward
from
the
baseboards
intermittent
patches
of
red
light
spilling
out
onto
the
tile
floors.
As
Langdon
gazed
down
the
murky
corridor,
he
realized
he
should
have
anticipated
this
scene.
Virtually
all
major
galleries
employed
red
service
lighting
at
night
strategically
placed,
low
level,
noninvasive
lights
that
enabled
staff
members
to
navigate
hallways
and
yet
kept
the
paintings
in
relative
darkness
to
slow
the
fading
effects
of
overexposure
to
light.
Tonight,
the
museum
possessed
an
almost
oppressive
quality.
Long
shadows
encroached
everywhere,
and
the
usually
soaring
vaulted
ceilings
appeared
as
a
low,
black
void.
"This
way,"
Fache
said,
turning
sharply
right
and
setting
out
through
a
series
of
interconnected
galleries.
Langdon
followed,
his
vision
slowly
adjusting
to
the
dark.
All
around,
large
format
oils
began
to
materialize
like
photos
developing
before
him
in
an
enormous
darkroom
their
eyes
following
as
he
moved
through
the
rooms.
He
could
taste
the
familiar
tang
of
museum
air
an
arid,
deionized
essence
that
carried
a
faint
hint
of
carbon
the
product
of
industrial,
coal
filter
dehumidifiers
that
ran
around
the
clock
to
counteract
the
corrosive
carbon
dioxide
exhaled
by
visitors.
Mounted
high
on
the
walls,
the
visible
security
cameras
sent
a
clear
message
to
visitors:
We
see
you.
Do
not
touch
anything.
"Any
of
them
real?"
Langdon
asked,
motioning
to
the
cameras.
Fache
shook
his
head.
"Of
course
not."
Langdon
was
not
surprised.
Video
surveillance
in
museums
this
size
was
cost
prohibitive
and
ineffective.
With
acres
of
galleries
to
watch
over,
the
Louvre
would
require
several
hundred
technicians
simply
to
monitor
the
feeds.
Most
large
museums
now
used
"containment
security."
Forget
keeping
thieves
out.
Keep
them
in.
Containment
was
activated
after
hours,
and
if
an
intruder
removed
a
piece
of
artwork,
compartmentalized
exits
would
seal
around
that
gallery,
and
the
thief
would
find
himself
behind
bars
even
before
the
police
arrived.
The
sound
of
voices
echoed
down
the
marble
corridor
up
ahead.
The
noise
seemed
to
be
coming
from
a
large
recessed
alcove
that
lay
ahead
on
the
right.
A
bright
light
spilled
out
into
the
hallway.
"Office
of
the
curator,"
the
captain
said.
As
he
and
Fache
drew
nearer
the
alcove,
Langdon
peered
down
a
short
hallway,
into
Sauniere's
luxurious
study
warm
wood,
Old
Master
paintings,
and
an
enormous
antique
desk
on
which
stood
a
two
foot
tall
model
of
a
knight
in
full
armor.
A
handful
of
police
agents
bustled
about
the
room,
talking
on
phones
and
taking
notes.
One
of
them
was
seated
at
Sauniere's
desk,
typing
into
a
laptop.
Apparently,
the
curator's
private
office
had
become
DCPJ's
makeshift
command
post
for
the
evening.
"Messieurs,
"
Fache
called
out,
and
the
men
turned.
"Ne
nous
derangez
pas
sous
aucun
pretexte.
Entendu?"
Everyone
inside
the
office
nodded
their
understanding.
Langdon
had
hung
enough
NE
PAS
DERANGER
signs
on
hotel
room
doors
to
catch
the
gist
of
the
captain's
orders.
Fache
and
Langdon
were
not
to
be
disturbed
under
any
circumstances.
Leaving
the
small
congregation
of
agents
behind,
Fache
led
Langdon
farther
down
the
darkened
hallway.
Thirty
yards
ahead
loomed
the
gateway
to
the
Louvre's
most
popular
section
la
Grande
Galerie
a
seemingly
endless
corridor
that
housed
the
Louvre's
most
valuable
Italian
masterpieces.
Langdon
had
already
discerned
that
this
was
where
Sauniere's
body
lay;
the
Grand
Gallery's
famous
parquet
floor
had
been
unmistakable
in
the
Polaroid.
As
they
approached,
Langdon
saw
the
entrance
was
blocked
by
an
enormous
steel
grate
that
looked
like
something
used
by
medieval
castles
to
keep
out
marauding
armies.
"Containment
security,
"
Fache
said,
as
they
neared
the
grate.
Even
in
the
darkness,
the
barricade
looked
like
it
could
have
restrained
a
tank.
Arriving
outside,
Langdon
peered
through
the
bars
into
the
dimly
lit
caverns
of
the
Grand
Gallery.
"After
you,
Mr.
Langdon,"
Fache
said.
Langdon
turned.
After
me,
where
?
Fache
motioned
toward
the
floor
at
the
base
of
the
grate.
Langdon
looked
down.
In
the
darkness,
he
hadn't
noticed.
The
barricade
was
raised
about
two
feet,
providing
an
awkward
clearance
underneath.
"This
area
is
still
off
limits
to
Louvre
security,"
Fache
said.
"My
team
from
Police
Technique
et
Scientifique
has
just
finished
their
investigation."
He
motioned
to
the
opening.
"Please
slide
under."
Langdon
stared
at
the
narrow
crawl
space
at
his
feet
and
then
up
at
the
massive
iron
grate.
He's
kidding,
right?
The
barricade
looked
like
a
guillotine
waiting
to
crush
intruders.
Fache
grumbled
something
in
French
and
checked
his
watch.
Then
he
dropped
to
his
knees
and
slithered
his
bulky
frame
underneath
the
grate.
On
the
other
side,
he
stood
up
and
looked
back
through
the
bars
at
Langdon.
Langdon
sighed.
Placing
his
palms
flat
on
the
polished
parquet,
he
lay
on
his
stomach
and
pulled
himself
forward.
As
he
slid
underneath,
the
nape
of
his
Harris
tweed
snagged
on
the
bottom
of
the
grate,
and
he
cracked
the
back
of
his
head
on
the
iron.
Very
suave,
Robert,
he
thought,
fumbling
and
then
finally
pulling
himself
through.
As
he
stood
up,
Langdon
was
beginning
to
suspect
it
was
going
to
be
a
very
long
night.
Murray
Hill
Place
the
new
Opus
Dei
World
Headquarters
and
conference
center
is
located
at
243
Lexington
Avenue
in
New
York
City.
With
a
price
tag
of
just
over
$47
million,
the
133,000
square
foot
tower
is
clad
in
red
brick
and
Indiana
limestone.
Designed
by
May
&amp;
Pinska,
the
building
contains
over
one
hundred
bedrooms,
six
dining
rooms,
libraries,
living
rooms,
meeting
rooms,
and
offices.
The
second,
eighth,
and
sixteenth
floors
contain
chapels,
ornamented
with
mill
work
and
marble.
The
seventeenth
floor
is
entirely
residential.
Men
enter
the
building
through
the
main
doors
on
Lexington
Avenue.
Women
enter
through
a
side
street
and
are
"acoustically
and
visually
separated"
from
the
men
at
all
times
within
the
building.
Earlier
this
evening,
within
the
sanctuary
of
his
penthouse
apartment,
Bishop
Manuel
Aringarosa
had
packed
a
small
travel
bag
and
dressed
in
a
traditional
black
cassock.
Normally,
he
would
have
wrapped
a
purple
cincture
around
his
waist,
but
tonight
he
would
be
traveling
among
the
public,
and
he
preferred
not
to
draw
attention
to
his
high
office.
Only
those
with
a
keen
eye
would
notice
his
14
karat
gold
bishop's
ring
with
purple
amethyst,
large
diamonds,
and
hand
tooled
mitre
crozier
applique.
Throwing
the
travel
bag
over
his
shoulder,
he
said
a
silent
prayer
and
left
his
apartment,
descending
to
the
lobby
where
his
driver
was
waiting
to
take
him
to
the
airport.
Now,
sitting
aboard
a
commercial
airliner
bound
for
Rome,
Aringarosa
gazed
out
the
window
at
the
dark
Atlantic.
The
sun
had
already
set,
but
Aringarosa
knew
his
own
star
was
on
the
rise.
Tonight
the
battle
will
be
won,
he
thought,
amazed
that
only
months
ago
he
had
felt
powerless
against
the
hands
that
threatened
to
destroy
his
empire.
As
president
general
of
Opus
Dei,
Bishop
Aringarosa
had
spent
the
last
decade
of
his
life
spreading
the
message
of
"God's
Work"
literally,
Opus
Dei.
The
congregation,
founded
in
1928
by
the
Spanish
priest
Josemaria
Escriva,
promoted
a
return
to
conservative
Catholic
values
and
encouraged
its
members
to
make
sweeping
sacrifices
in
their
own
lives
in
order
to
do
the
Work
of
God.
Opus
Dei's
traditionalist
philosophy
initially
had
taken
root
in
Spain
before
Franco's
regime,
but
with
the
1934
publication
of
Josemaria
Escriva's
spiritual
book
The
Way
999
points
of
meditation
for
doing
God's
Work
in
one's
own
life
Escriva's
message
exploded
across
the
world.
Now,
with
over
four
million
copies
of
The
Way
in
circulation
in
forty
two
languages,
Opus
Dei
was
a
global
force.
Its
residence
halls,
teaching
centers,
and
even
universities
could
be
found
in
almost
every
major
metropolis
on
earth.
Opus
Dei
was
the
fastest
growing
and
most
financially
secure
Catholic
organization
in
the
world.
Unfortunately,
Aringarosa
had
learned,
in
an
age
of
religious
cynicism,
cults,
and
televangelists,
Opus
Dei's
escalating
wealth
and
power
was
a
magnet
for
suspicion.
"Many
call
Opus
Dei
a
brainwashing
cult,"
reporters
often
challenged.
"Others
call
you
an
ultraconservative
Christian
secret
society.
Which
are
you?"
"Opus
Dei
is
neither,"
the
bishop
would
patiently
reply.
"We
are
a
Catholic
Church.
We
are
a
congregation
of
Catholics
who
have
chosen
as
our
priority
to
follow
Catholic
doctrine
as
rigorously
as
we
can
in
our
own
daily
lives."
"Does
God's
Work
necessarily
include
vows
of
chastity,
tithing,
and
atonement
for
sins
through
self
flagellation
and
the
cilice?"
"You
are
describing
only
a
small
portion
of
the
Opus
Dei
population,"
Aringarosa
said.
"There
are
many
levels
of
involvement.
Thousands
of
Opus
Dei
members
are
married,
have
families,
and
do
God's
Work
in
their
own
communities.
Others
choose
lives
of
asceticism
within
our
cloistered
residence
halls.
These
choices
are
personal,
but
everyone
in
Opus
Dei
shares
the
goal
of
bettering
the
world
by
doing
the
Work
of
God.
Surely
this
is
an
admirable
quest."
Reason
seldom
worked,
though.
The
media
always
gravitated
toward
scandal,
and
Opus
Dei,
like
most
large
organizations,
had
within
its
membership
a
few
misguided
souls
who
cast
a
shadow
over
the
entire
group.
Two
months
ago,
an
Opus
Dei
group
at
a
midwestern
university
had
been
caught
drugging
new
recruits
with
mescaline
in
an
effort
to
induce
a
euphoric
state
that
neophytes
would
perceive
as
a
religious
experience.
Another
university
student
had
used
his
barbed
cilice
belt
more
often
than
the
recommended
two
hours
a
day
and
had
given
himself
a
near
lethal
infection.
In
Boston
not
long
ago,
a
disillusioned
young
investment
banker
had
signed
over
his
entire
life
savings
to
Opus
Dei
before
attempting
suicide.
Misguided
sheep,
Aringarosa
thought,
his
heart
going
out
to
them.
Of
course
the
ultimate
embarrassment
had
been
the
widely
publicized
trial
of
FBI
spy
Robert
Hanssen,
who,
in
addition
to
being
a
prominent
member
of
Opus
Dei,
had
turned
out
to
be
a
sexual
deviant,
his
trial
uncovering
evidence
that
he
had
rigged
hidden
video
cameras
in
his
own
bedroom
so
his
friends
could
watch
him
having
sex
with
his
wife.
"Hardly
the
pastime
of
a
devout
Catholic,"
the
judge
had
noted.
Sadly,
all
of
these
events
had
helped
spawn
the
new
watch
group
known
as
the
Opus
Dei
Awareness
Network
(ODAN).
The
group's
popular
website
www.odan.org
relayed
frightening
stories
from
former
Opus
Dei
members
who
warned
of
the
dangers
of
joining.
The
media
was
now
referring
to
Opus
Dei
as
"God's
Mafia"
and
"the
Cult
of
Christ."
We
fear
what
we
do
not
understand,
Aringarosa
thought,
wondering
if
these
critics
had
any
idea
how
many
lives
Opus
Dei
had
enriched.
The
group
enjoyed
the
full
endorsement
and
blessing
of
the
Vatican.
Opus
Dei
is
a
personal
prelature
of
the
Pope
himself.
Recently,
however,
Opus
Dei
had
found
itself
threatened
by
a
force
infinitely
more
powerful
than
the
media
an
unexpected
foe
from
which
Aringarosa
could
not
possibly
hide.
Five
months
ago,
the
kaleidoscope
of
power
had
been
shaken,
and
Aringarosa
was
still
reeling
from
the
blow.
"They
know
not
the
war
they
have
begun,"
Aringarosa
whispered
to
himself,
staring
out
the
plane's
window
at
the
darkness
of
the
ocean
below.
For
an
instant,
his
eyes
refocused,
lingering
on
the
reflection
of
his
awkward
face
dark
and
oblong,
dominated
by
a
flat,
crooked
nose
that
had
been
shattered
by
a
fist
in
Spain
when
he
was
a
young
missionary.
The
physical
flaw
barely
registered
now.
Aringarosa's
was
a
world
of
the
soul,
not
of
the
flesh.
As
the
jet
passed
over
the
coast
of
Portugal,
the
cell
phone
in
Aringarosa's
cassock
began
vibrating
in
silent
ring
mode.
Despite
airline
regulations
prohibiting
the
use
of
cell
phones
during
flights,
Aringarosa
knew
this
was
a
call
he
could
not
miss.
Only
one
man
possessed
this
number,
the
man
who
had
mailed
Aringarosa
the
phone.
Excited,
the
bishop
answered
quietly.
"Yes?"
"Silas
has
located
the
keystone,"
the
caller
said.
"It
is
in
Paris.
Within
the
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice."
Bishop
Aringarosa
smiled.
"Then
we
are
close."
"We
can
obtain
it
immediately.
But
we
need
your
influence."
"Of
course.
Tell
me
what
to
do."
When
Aringarosa
switched
off
the
phone,
his
heart
was
pounding.
He
gazed
once
again
into
the
void
of
night,
feeling
dwarfed
by
the
events
he
had
put
into
motion.
Five
hundred
miles
away,
the
albino
named
Silas
stood
over
a
small
basin
of
water
and
dabbed
the
blood
from
his
back,
watching
the
patterns
of
red
spinning
in
the
water.
Purge
me
with
hyssop
and
I
shall
be
clean,
he
prayed,
quoting
Psalms.
Wash
me,
and
I
shall
be
whiter
than
snow.
Silas
was
feeling
an
aroused
anticipation
that
he
had
not
felt
since
his
previous
life.
It
both
surprised
and
electrified
him.
For
the
last
decade,
he
had
been
following
The
Way,
cleansing
himself
of
sins
rebuilding
his
life
erasing
the
violence
in
his
past.
Tonight,
however,
it
had
all
come
rushing
back.
The
hatred
he
had
fought
so
hard
to
bury
had
been
summoned.
He
had
been
startled
how
quickly
his
past
had
resurfaced.
And
with
it,
of
course,
had
come
his
skills.
Rusty
but
serviceable.
Jesus'
message
is
one
of
peace
of
nonviolence
of
love.
This
was
the
message
Silas
had
been
taught
from
the
beginning,
and
the
message
he
held
in
his
heart.
And
yet
this
was
the
message
the
enemies
of
Christ
now
threatened
to
destroy.
Those
who
threaten
God
with
force
will
be
met
with
force.
Immovable
and
steadfast.
For
two
millennia,
Christian
soldiers
had
defended
their
faith
against
those
who
tried
to
displace
it.
Tonight,
Silas
had
been
called
to
battle.
Drying
his
wounds,
he
donned
his
ankle
length,
hooded
robe.
It
was
plain,
made
of
dark
wool,
accentuating
the
whiteness
of
his
skin
and
hair.
Tightening
the
rope
tie
around
his
waist,
he
raised
the
hood
over
his
head
and
allowed
his
red
eyes
to
admire
his
reflection
in
the
mirror.
The
wheels
are
in
motion.
Having
squeezed
beneath
the
security
gate,
Robert
Langdon
now
stood
just
inside
the
entrance
to
the
Grand
Gallery.
He
was
staring
into
the
mouth
of
a
long,
deep
canyon.
On
either
side
of
the
gallery,
stark
walls
rose
thirty
feet,
evaporating
into
the
darkness
above.
The
reddish
glow
of
the
service
lighting
sifted
upward,
casting
an
unnatural
smolder
across
a
staggering
collection
of
Da
Vincis,
Titians,
and
Caravaggios
that
hung
suspended
from
ceiling
cables.
Still
lifes,
religious
scenes,
and
landscapes
accompanied
portraits
of
nobility
and
politicians.
Although
the
Grand
Gallery
housed
the
Louvre's
most
famous
Italian
art,
many
visitors
felt
the
wing's
most
stunning
offering
was
actually
its
famous
parquet
floor.
Laid
out
in
a
dazzling
geometric
design
of
diagonal
oak
slats,
the
floor
produced
an
ephemeral
optical
illusion
a
multi
dimensional
network
that
gave
visitors
the
sense
they
were
floating
through
the
gallery
on
a
surface
that
changed
with
every
step.
As
Langdon's
gaze
began
to
trace
the
inlay,
his
eyes
stopped
short
on
an
unexpected
object
lying
on
the
floor
just
a
few
yards
to
his
left,
surrounded
by
police
tape.
He
spun
toward
Fache.
"Is
that
a
Caravaggio
on
the
floor?"
Fache
nodded
without
even
looking.
The
painting,
Langdon
guessed,
was
worth
upward
of
two
million
dollars,
and
yet
it
was
lying
on
the
floor
like
a
discarded
poster.
"What
the
devil
is
it
doing
on
the
floor!"
Fache
glowered,
clearly
unmoved.
"This
is
a
crime
scene,
Mr.
Langdon.
We
have
touched
nothing.
That
canvas
was
pulled
from
the
wall
by
the
curator.
It
was
how
he
activated
the
security
system."
Langdon
looked
back
at
the
gate,
trying
to
picture
what
had
happened.
"The
curator
was
attacked
in
his
office,
fled
into
the
Grand
Gallery,
and
activated
the
security
gate
by
pulling
that
painting
from
the
wall.
The
gate
fell
immediately,
sealing
off
all
access.
This
is
the
only
door
in
or
out
of
this
gallery."
Langdon
felt
confused.
"So
the
curator
actually
captured
his
attacker
inside
the
Grand
Gallery?"
Fache
shook
his
head.
"The
security
gate
separated
Sauniere
from
his
attacker.
The
killer
was
locked
out
there
in
the
hallway
and
shot
Sauniere
through
this
gate."
Fache
pointed
toward
an
orange
tag
hanging
from
one
of
the
bars
on
the
gate
under
which
they
had
just
passed.
"The
PTS
team
found
flashback
residue
from
a
gun.
He
fired
through
the
bars.
Sauniere
died
in
here
alone."
Langdon
pictured
the
photograph
of
Sauniere's
body.
They
said
he
did
that
to
himself.
Langdon
looked
out
at
the
enormous
corridor
before
them.
"So
where
is
his
body?"
Fache
straightened
his
cruciform
tie
clip
and
began
to
walk.
"As
you
probably
know,
the
Grand
Gallery
is
quite
long."
The
exact
length,
if
Langdon
recalled
correctly,
was
around
fifteen
hundred
feet,
the
length
of
three
Washington
Monuments
laid
end
to
end.
Equally
breathtaking
was
the
corridor's
width,
which
easily
could
have
accommodated
a
pair
of
side
by
side
passenger
trains.
The
center
of
the
hallway
was
dotted
by
the
occasional
statue
or
colossal
porcelain
urn,
which
served
as
a
tasteful
divider
and
kept
the
flow
of
traffic
moving
down
one
wall
and
up
the
other.
Fache
was
silent
now,
striding
briskly
up
the
right
side
of
the
corridor
with
his
gaze
dead
ahead.
Langdon
felt
almost
disrespectful
to
be
racing
past
so
many
masterpieces
without
pausing
for
so
much
as
a
glance.
Not
that
I
could
see
anything
in
this
lighting,
he
thought.
The
muted
crimson
lighting
unfortunately
conjured
memories
of
Langdon'
s
last
experience
in
noninvasive
lighting
in
the
Vatican
Secret
Archives.
This
was
tonight's
second
unsettling
parallel
with
his
near
death
in
Rome.
He
flashed
on
Vittoria
again.
She
had
been
absent
from
his
dreams
for
months.
Langdon
could
not
believe
Rome
had
been
only
a
year
ago;
it
felt
like
decades.
Another
life.
His
last
correspondence
from
Vittoria
had
been
in
December
a
postcard
saying
she
was
headed
to
the
Java
Sea
to
continue
her
research
in
entanglement
physics
something
about
using
satellites
to
track
manta
ray
migrations.
Langdon
had
never
harbored
delusions
that
a
woman
like
Vittoria
Vetra
could
have
been
happy
living
with
him
on
a
college
campus,
but
their
encounter
in
Rome
had
unlocked
in
him
a
longing
he
never
imagined
he
could
feel.
His
lifelong
affinity
for
bachelorhood
and
the
simple
freedoms
it
allowed
had
been
shaken
somehow
replaced
by
an
unexpected
emptiness
that
seemed
to
have
grown
over
the
past
year.
They
continued
walking
briskly,
yet
Langdon
still
saw
no
corpse.
"Jacques
Sauniere
went
this
far?"
"Mr.
Sauniere
suffered
a
bullet
wound
to
his
stomach.
He
died
very
slowly.
Perhaps
over
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes.
He
was
obviously
a
man
of
great
personal
strength."
Langdon
turned,
appalled.
"Security
took
fifteen
minutes
to
get
here?"
"Of
course
not.
Louvre
security
responded
immediately
to
the
alarm
and
found
the
Grand
Gallery
sealed.
Through
the
gate,
they
could
hear
someone
moving
around
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor,
but
they
could
not
see
who
it
was.
They
shouted,
but
they
got
no
answer.
Assuming
it
could
only
be
a
criminal,
they
followed
protocol
and
called
in
the
Judicial
Police.
We
took
up
positions
within
fifteen
minutes.
When
we
arrived,
we
raised
the
barricade
enough
to
slip
underneath,
and
I
sent
a
dozen
armed
agents
inside.
They
swept
the
length
of
the
gallery
to
corner
the
intruder."
"And?"
"They
found
no
one
inside.
Except"
He
pointed
farther
down
the
hall.
"Him."
Langdon
lifted
his
gaze
and
followed
Fache's
outstretched
finger.
At
first
he
thought
Fache
was
pointing
to
a
large
marble
statue
in
the
middle
of
the
hallway.
As
they
continued,
though,
Langdon
began
to
see
past
the
statue.
Thirty
yards
down
the
hall,
a
single
spotlight
on
a
portable
pole
stand
shone
down
on
the
floor,
creating
a
stark
island
of
white
light
in
the
dark
crimson
gallery.
In
the
center
of
the
light,
like
an
insect
under
a
microscope,
the
corpse
of
the
curator
lay
naked
on
the
parquet
floor.
"You
saw
the
photograph,"
Fache
said,
"so
this
should
be
of
no
surprise."
Langdon
felt
a
deep
chill
as
they
approached
the
body.
Before
him
was
one
of
the
strangest
images
he
had
ever
seen.
The
pallid
corpse
of
Jacques
Sauniere
lay
on
the
parquet
floor
exactly
as
it
appeared
in
the
photograph.
As
Langdon
stood
over
the
body
and
squinted
in
the
harsh
light,
he
reminded
himself
to
his
amazement
that
Sauniere
had
spent
his
last
minutes
of
life
arranging
his
own
body
in
this
strange
fashion.
Sauniere
looked
remarkably
fit
for
a
man
of
his
years
and
all
of
his
musculature
was
in
plain
view.
He
had
stripped
off
every
shred
of
clothing,
placed
it
neatly
on
the
floor,
and
laid
down
on
his
back
in
the
center
of
the
wide
corridor,
perfectly
aligned
with
the
long
axis
of
the
room.
His
arms
and
legs
were
sprawled
outward
in
a
wide
spread
eagle,
like
those
of
a
child
making
a
snow
angel
or,
perhaps
more
appropriately,
like
a
man
being
drawn
and
quartered
by
some
invisible
force.
Just
below
Sauniere's
breastbone,
a
bloody
smear
marked
the
spot
where
the
bullet
had
pierced
his
flesh.
The
wound
had
bled
surprisingly
little,
leaving
only
a
small
pool
of
blackened
blood.
Sauniere's
left
index
finger
was
also
bloody,
apparently
having
been
dipped
into
the
wound
to
create
the
most
unsettling
aspect
of
his
own
macabre
deathbed;
using
his
own
blood
as
ink,
and
employing
his
own
naked
abdomen
as
a
canvas,
Sauniere
had
drawn
a
simple
symbol
on
his
flesh
five
straight
lines
that
intersected
to
form
a
five
pointed
star.
The
pentacle.
The
bloody
star,
centered
on
Sauniere's
navel,
gave
his
corpse
a
distinctly
ghoulish
aura.
The
photo
Langdon
had
seen
was
chilling
enough,
but
now,
witnessing
the
scene
in
person,
Langdon
felt
a
deepening
uneasiness.
He
did
this
to
himself.
"Mr.
Langdon?"
Fache's
dark
eyes
settled
on
him
again.
"It's
a
pentacle,"
Langdon
offered,
his
voice
feeling
hollow
in
the
huge
space.
"One
of
the
oldest
symbols
on
earth.
Used
over
four
thousand
years
before
Christ."
"And
what
does
it
mean?"
Langdon
always
hesitated
when
he
got
this
question.
Telling
someone
what
a
symbol
"meant"
was
like
telling
them
how
a
song
should
make
them
feel
it
was
different
for
all
people.
A
white
Ku
Klux
Klan
headpiece
conjured
images
of
hatred
and
racism
in
the
United
States,
and
yet
the
same
costume
carried
a
meaning
of
religious
faith
in
Spain.
"Symbols
carry
different
meanings
in
different
settings,"
Langdon
said.
"Primarily,
the
pentacle
is
a
pagan
religious
symbol."
Fache
nodded.
"Devil
worship."
"No,"
Langdon
corrected,
immediately
realizing
his
choice
of
vocabulary
should
have
been
clearer.
Nowadays,
the
term
pagan
had
become
almost
synonymous
with
devil
worship
a
gross
misconception.
The
word's
roots
actually
reached
back
to
the
Latin
paganus,
meaning
country
dwellers.
"Pagans"
were
literally
unindoctrinated
country
folk
who
clung
to
the
old,
rural
religions
of
Nature
worship.
In
fact,
so
strong
was
the
Church's
fear
of
those
who
lived
in
the
rural
villes
that
the
once
innocuous
word
for
"villager"
villain
came
to
mean
a
wicked
soul.
"The
pentacle,"
Langdon
clarified,
"is
a
pre
Christian
symbol
that
relates
to
Nature
worship.
The
ancients
envisioned
their
world
in
two
halves
masculine
and
feminine.
Their
gods
and
goddesses
worked
to
keep
a
balance
of
power.
Yin
and
yang.
When
male
and
female
were
balanced,
there
was
harmony
in
the
world.
When
they
were
unbalanced,
there
was
chaos."
Langdon
motioned
to
Sauniere's
stomach.
"This
pentacle
is
representative
of
the
female
half
of
all
things
a
concept
religious
historians
call
the
'sacred
feminine'
or
the
'divine
goddess.'
Sauniere,
of
all
people,
would
know
this."
"Sauniere
drew
a
goddess
symbol
on
his
stomach?"
Langdon
had
to
admit,
it
seemed
odd.
"In
its
most
specific
interpretation,
the
pentacle
symbolizes
Venus
the
goddess
of
female
sexual
love
and
beauty."
Fache
eyed
the
naked
man,
and
grunted.
"Early
religion
was
based
on
the
divine
order
of
Nature.
The
goddess
Venus
and
the
planet
Venus
were
one
and
the
same.
The
goddess
had
a
place
in
the
nighttime
sky
and
was
known
by
many
names
Venus,
the
Eastern
Star,
Ishtar,
Astarte
all
of
them
powerful
female
concepts
with
ties
to
Nature
and
Mother
Earth.
Fache
looked
more
troubled
now,
as
if
he
somehow
preferred
the
idea
of
devil
worship.
Langdon
decided
not
to
share
the
pentacle's
most
astonishing
property
the
graphic
origin
of
its
ties
to
Venus.
As
a
young
astronomy
student,
Langdon
had
been
stunned
to
learn
the
planet
Venus
traced
a
perfect
pentacle
across
the
ecliptic
sky
every
four
years.
So
astonished
were
the
ancients
to
observe
this
phenomenon,
that
Venus
and
her
pentacle
became
symbols
of
perfection,
beauty,
and
the
cyclic
qualities
of
sexual
love.
As
a
tribute
to
the
magic
of
Venus,
the
Greeks
used
her
four
year
cycle
to
organize
their
Olympiads.
Nowadays,
few
people
realized
that
the
four
year
schedule
of
modern
Olympic
Games
still
followed
the
cycles
of
Venus.
Even
fewer
people
knew
that
the
five
pointed
star
had
almost
become
the
official
Olympic
seal
but
was
modified
at
the
last
moment
its
five
points
exchanged
for
five
intersecting
rings
to
better
reflect
the
games'
spirit
of
inclusion
and
harmony.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
Fache
said
abruptly.
"Obviously,
the
pentacle
must
also
relate
to
the
devil.
Your
American
horror
movies
make
that
point
clearly."
Langdon
frowned.
Thank
you,
Hollywood.
The
five
pointed
star
was
now
a
virtual
cliche
in
Satanic
serial
killer
movies,
usually
scrawled
on
the
wall
of
some
Satanist's
apartment
along
with
other
alleged
demonic
symbology.
Langdon
was
always
frustrated
when
he
saw
the
symbol
in
this
context;
the
pentacle's
true
origins
were
actually
quite
godly.
"I
assure
you,"
Langdon
said,
"despite
what
you
see
in
the
movies,
the
pentacle's
demonic
interpretation
is
historically
inaccurate.
The
original
feminine
meaning
is
correct,
but
the
symbolism
of
the
pentacle
has
been
distorted
over
the
millennia.
In
this
case,
through
bloodshed."
"I'm
not
sure
I
follow."
Langdon
glanced
at
Fache's
crucifix,
uncertain
how
to
phrase
his
next
point.
"The
Church,
sir.
Symbols
are
very
resilient,
but
the
pentacle
was
altered
by
the
early
Roman
Catholic
Church.
As
part
of
the
Vatican's
campaign
to
eradicate
pagan
religions
and
convert
the
masses
to
Christianity,
the
Church
launched
a
smear
campaign
against
the
pagan
gods
and
goddesses,
recasting
their
divine
symbols
as
evil.
"Goon."
"This
is
very
common
in
times
of
turmoil,"
Langdon
continued.
"A
newly
emerging
power
will
take
over
the
existing
symbols
and
degrade
them
over
time
in
an
attempt
to
erase
their
meaning.
In
the
battle
between
the
pagan
symbols
and
Christian
symbols,
the
pagans
lost;
Poseidon's
trident
became
the
devil's
pitchfork,
the
wise
crone's
pointed
hat
became
the
symbol
of
a
witch,
and
Venus's
pentacle
became
a
sign
of
the
devil."
Langdon
paused.
"Unfortunately,
the
United
States
military
has
also
perverted
the
pentacle;
it's
now
our
foremost
symbol
of
war.
We
paint
it
on
all
our
fighter
jets
and
hang
it
on
the
shoulders
of
all
our
generals."
So
much
for
the
goddess
of
love
and
beauty.
"Interesting."
Fache
nodded
toward
the
spread
eagle
corpse.
"And
the
positioning
of
the
body?
What
do
you
make
of
that?"
Langdon
shrugged.
"The
position
simply
reinforces
the
reference
to
the
pentacle
and
sacred
feminine."
Fache's
expression
clouded.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"Replication.
Repeating
a
symbol
is
the
simplest
way
to
strengthen
its
meaning.
Jacques
Sauniere
positioned
himself
in
the
shape
of
a
five
pointed
star."
If
one
pentacle
is
good,
two
is
better.
Fache's
eyes
followed
the
five
points
of
Sauniere's
arms,
legs,
and
head
as
he
again
ran
a
hand
across
his
slick
hair.
"Interesting
analysis."
He
paused.
"And
the
nudity?"
He
grumbled
as
he
spoke
the
word,
sounding
repulsed
by
the
sight
of
an
aging
male
body.
"Why
did
he
remove
his
clothing?"
Damned
good
question,
Langdon
thought.
He'd
been
wondering
the
same
thing
ever
since
he
first
saw
the
Polaroid.
His
best
guess
was
that
a
naked
human
form
was
yet
another
endorsement
of
Venus
the
goddess
of
human
sexuality.
Although
modern
culture
had
erased
much
of
Venus's
association
with
the
malefemale
physical
union,
a
sharp
etymological
eye
could
still
spot
a
vestige
of
Venus's
original
meaning
in
the
word
"venereal."
Langdon
decided
not
to
go
there.
"Mr.
Fache,
I
obviously
can't
tell
you
why
Mr.
Sauniere
drew
that
symbol
on
himself
or
placed
himself
in
this
way,
but
I
can
tell
you
that
a
man
like
Jacques
Sauniere
would
consider
the
pentacle
a
sign
of
the
female
deity.
The
correlation
between
this
symbol
and
the
sacred
feminine
is
widely
known
by
art
historians
and
symbologists."
"Fine.
And
the
use
of
his
own
blood
as
ink?"
"Obviously
he
had
nothing
else
to
write
with."
Fache
was
silent
a
moment.
"Actually,
I
believe
he
used
blood
such
that
the
police
would
follow
certain
forensic
procedures."
"I'm
sorry?"
"Look
at
his
left
hand."
Langdon's
eyes
traced
the
length
of
the
curator's
pale
arm
to
his
left
hand
but
saw
nothing.
Uncertain,
he
circled
the
corpse
and
crouched
down,
now
noting
with
surprise
that
the
curator
was
clutching
a
large,
felt
tipped
marker.
"Sauniere
was
holding
it
when
we
found
him,"
Fache
said,
leaving
Langdon
and
moving
several
yards
to
a
portable
table
covered
with
investigation
tools,
cables,
and
assorted
electronic
gear.
"As
I
told
you,"
he
said,
rummaging
around
the
table,
"we
have
touched
nothing.
Are
you
familiar
with
this
kind
of
pen?"
Langdon
knelt
down
farther
to
see
the
pen's
label.
STYLO
DE
LUMIERE
NOIRE.
He
glanced
up
in
surprise.
The
black
light
pen
or
watermark
stylus
was
a
specialized
felt
tipped
marker
originally
designed
by
museums,
restorers,
and
forgery
police
to
place
invisible
marks
on
items.
The
stylus
wrote
in
a
noncorrosive,
alcohol
based
fluorescent
ink
that
was
visible
only
under
black
light.
Nowadays,
museum
maintenance
staffs
carried
these
markers
on
their
daily
rounds
to
place
invisible
"tick
marks"
on
the
frames
of
paintings
that
needed
restoration.
As
Langdon
stood
up,
Fache
walked
over
to
the
spotlight
and
turned
it
off.
The
gallery
plunged
into
sudden
darkness.
Momentarily
blinded,
Langdon
felt
a
rising
uncertainty.
Fache's
silhouette
appeared,
illuminated
in
bright
purple.
He
approached
carrying
a
portable
light
source,
which
shrouded
him
in
a
violet
haze.
"As
you
may
know,"
Fache
said,
his
eyes
luminescing
in
the
violet
glow,
"police
use
black
light
illumination
to
search
crime
scenes
for
blood
and
other
forensic
evidence.
So
you
can
imagine
our
surprise"
Abruptly,
he
pointed
the
light
down
at
the
corpse.
Langdon
looked
down
and
jumped
back
in
shock.
His
heart
pounded
as
he
took
in
the
bizarre
sight
now
glowing
before
him
on
the
parquet
floor.
Scrawled
in
luminescent
handwriting,
the
curator's
final
words
glowed
purple
beside
his
corpse.
As
Langdon
stared
at
the
shimmering
text,
he
felt
the
fog
that
had
surrounded
this
entire
night
growing
thicker.
Langdon
read
the
message
again
and
looked
up
at
Fache.
"What
the
hell
does
this
mean!"
Fache's
eyes
shone
white.
"That,
monsieur,
is
precisely
the
question
you
are
here
to
answer."
Not
far
away,
inside
Sauniere's
office,
Lieutenant
Collet
had
returned
to
the
Louvre
and
was
huddled
over
an
audio
console
set
up
on
the
curator's
enormous
desk.
With
the
exception
of
the
eerie,
robot
like
doll
of
a
medieval
knight
that
seemed
to
be
staring
at
him
from
the
corner
of
Sauniere's
desk,
Collet
was
comfortable.
He
adjusted
his
AKG
headphones
and
checked
the
input
levels
on
the
hard
disk
recording
system.
All
systems
were
go.
The
microphones
were
functioning
flawlessly,
and
the
audio
feed
was
crystal
clear.
he
moment
de
verite,
he
mused.
Smiling,
he
closed
his
eyes
and
settled
in
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
conversation
now
being
taped
inside
the
Grand
Gallery.
The
modest
dwelling
within
the
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice
was
located
on
the
second
floor
of
the
church
itself,
to
the
left
of
the
choir
balcony.
A
two
room
suite
with
a
stone
floor
and
minimal
furnishings,
it
had
been
home
to
Sister
Sandrine
Bieil
for
over
a
decade.
The
nearby
convent
was
her
formal
residence,
if
anyone
asked,
but
she
preferred
the
quiet
of
the
church
and
had
made
herself
quite
comfortable
upstairs
with
a
bed,
phone,
and
hot
plate.
As
the
church's
conservatrice
d'affaires,
Sister
Sandrine
was
responsible
for
overseeing
all
nonreligious
aspects
of
church
operations
general
maintenance,
hiring
support
staff
and
guides,
securing
the
building
after
hours,
and
ordering
supplies
like
communion
wine
and
wafers.
Tonight,
asleep
in
her
small
bed,
she
awoke
to
the
shrill
of
her
telephone.
Tiredly,
she
lifted
the
receiver.
"Soeur
Sandrine.
Eglise
Saint
Sulpice.
"Hello,
Sister,"
the
man
said
in
French.
Sister
Sandrine
sat
up.
What
time
is
it?
Although
she
recognized
her
boss's
voice,
in
fifteen
years
she
had
never
been
awoken
by
him.
The
abbe
was
a
deeply
pious
man
who
went
home
to
bed
immediately
after
mass.
"I
apologize
if
I
have
awoken
you,
Sister,"
the
abbe
said,
his
own
voice
sounding
groggy
and
on
edge.
"I
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you.
I
just
received
a
call
from
an
influential
American
bishop.
Perhaps
you
know
him?
Manuel
Aringarosa?"
"The
head
of
Opus
Dei?"
Of
course
I
know
of
him.
Who
in
the
Church
doesn't?
Aringarosa's
conservative
prelature
had
grown
powerful
in
recent
years.
Their
ascension
to
grace
was
jump
started
in
1982
when
Pope
John
Paul
II
unexpectedly
elevated
them
to
a
"personal
prelature
of
the
Pope,"
officially
sanctioning
all
of
their
practices.
Suspiciously,
Opus
Dei's
elevation
occurred
the
same
year
the
wealthy
sect
allegedly
had
transferred
almost
one
billion
dollars
into
the
Vatican's
Institute
for
Religious
Works
commonly
known
as
the
Vatican
Bank
bailing
it
out
of
an
embarrassing
bankruptcy.
In
a
second
maneuver
that
raised
eyebrows,
the
Pope
placed
the
founder
of
Opus
Dei
on
the
"fast
track"
for
sainthood,
accelerating
an
often
century
long
waiting
period
for
canonization
to
a
mere
twenty
years.
Sister
Sandrine
could
not
help
but
feel
that
Opus
Dei's
good
standing
in
Rome
was
suspect,
but
one
did
not
argue
with
the
Holy
See.
"Bishop
Aringarosa
called
to
ask
me
a
favor,"
the
abbe
told
her,
his
voice
nervous.
"One
of
his
numeraries
is
in
Paris
tonight."
As
Sister
Sandrine
listened
to
the
odd
request,
she
felt
a
deepening
confusion.
"I'm
sorry,
you
say
this
visiting
Opus
Dei
numerary
cannot
wait
until
morning?"
"I'm
afraid
not.
His
plane
leaves
very
early.
He
has
always
dreamed
of
seeing
Saint
Sulpice."
"But
the
church
is
far
more
interesting
by
day.
The
sun's
rays
through
the
oculus,
the
graduated
shadows
on
the
gnomon,
this
is
what
makes
Saint
Sulpice
unique."
"Sister,
I
agree,
and
yet
I
would
consider
it
a
personal
favor
if
you
could
let
him
in
tonight.
He
can
be
there
at
say
one
o'clock?
That's
in
twenty
minutes."
Sister
Sandrine
frowned.
"Of
course.
It
would
be
my
pleasure."
The
abbe
thanked
her
and
hung
up.
Puzzled,
Sister
Sandrine
remained
a
moment
in
the
warmth
of
her
bed,
trying
to
shake
off
the
cobwebs
of
sleep.
Her
sixty
year
old
body
did
not
awake
as
fast
as
it
used
to,
although
tonight's
phone
call
had
certainly
roused
her
senses.
Opus
Dei
had
always
made
her
uneasy.
Beyond
the
prelature's
adherence
to
the
arcane
ritual
of
corporal
mortification,
their
views
on
women
were
medieval
at
best.
She
had
been
shocked
to
learn
that
female
numeraries
were
forced
to
clean
the
men's
residence
halls
for
no
pay
while
the
men
were
at
mass;
women
slept
on
hardwood
floors,
while
the
men
had
straw
mats;
and
women
were
forced
to
endure
additional
requirements
of
corporal
mortification
all
as
added
penance
for
original
sin.
It
seemed
Eve's
bite
from
the
apple
of
knowledge
was
a
debt
women
were
doomed
to
pay
for
eternity.
Sadly,
while
most
of
the
Catholic
Church
was
gradually
moving
in
the
right
direction
with
respect
to
women's
rights,
Opus
Dei
threatened
to
reverse
the
progress.
Even
so,
Sister
Sandrine
had
her
orders.
Swinging
her
legs
off
the
bed,
she
stood
slowly,
chilled
by
the
cold
stone
on
the
soles
of
her
bare
feet.
As
the
chill
rose
through
her
flesh,
she
felt
an
unexpected
apprehension.
Women's
intuition?
A
follower
of
God,
Sister
Sandrine
had
learned
to
find
peace
in
the
calming
voices
of
her
own
soul.
Tonight,
however,
those
voices
were
as
silent
as
the
empty
church
around
her.
Langdon
couldn't
tear
his
eyes
from
the
glowing
purple
text
scrawled
across
the
parquet
floor.
Jacques
Sauniere's
final
communication
seemed
as
unlikely
a
departing
message
as
any
Langdon
could
imagine.
The
message
read:
13
3
2
21
1
1
8
5
O,
Draconian
devil
!
Oh,
lame
saint!
Although
Langdon
had
not
the
slightest
idea
what
it
meant,
he
did
understand
Fache's
instinct
that
the
pentacle
had
something
to
do
with
devil
worship.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Sauniere
had
left
a
literal
reference
to
the
devil.
Equally
as
bizarre
was
the
series
of
numbers.
"Part
of
it
looks
like
a
numeric
cipher.
"Yes,"
Fache
said.
"Our
cryptographers
are
already
working
on
it.
We
believe
these
numbers
may
be
the
key
to
who
killed
him.
Maybe
a
telephone
exchange
or
some
kind
of
social
identification.
Do
the
numbers
have
any
symbolic
meaning
to
you?"
Langdon
looked
again
at
the
digits,
sensing
it
would
take
him
hours
to
extract
any
symbolic
meaning.
If
Sauniere
had
even
intended
any.
To
Langdon,
the
numbers
looked
totally
random.
He
was
accustomed
to
symbolic
progressions
that
made
some
semblance
of
sense,
but
everything
here
the
pentacle,
the
text,
the
numbers
seemed
disparate
at
the
most
fundamental
level.
"You
alleged
earlier,"
Fache
said,
"that
Sauniere's
actions
here
were
all
in
an
effort
to
send
some
sort
of
message
goddess
worship
or
something
in
that
vein?
How
does
this
message
fit
in?"
Langdon
knew
the
question
was
rhetorical.
This
bizarre
communique
obviously
did
not
fit
Langdon's
scenario
of
goddess
worship
at
all.
O,
Draconian
devil?
Oh,
lame
saint?
Fache
said,
"This
text
appears
to
be
an
accusation
of
some
sort.
Wouldn't
you
agree?"
Langdon
tried
to
imagine
the
curator's
final
minutes
trapped
alone
in
the
Grand
Gallery,
knowing
he
was
about
to
die.
It
seemed
logical.
"An
accusation
against
his
murderer
makes
sense,
I
suppose."
"My
job,
of
course,
is
to
put
a
name
to
that
person.
Let
me
ask
you
this,
Mr.
Langdon.
To
your
eye,
beyond
the
numbers,
what
about
this
message
is
most
strange?"
Most
strange?
A
dying
man
had
barricaded
himself
in
the
gallery,
drawn
a
pentacle
on
himself,
and
scrawled
a
mysterious
accusation
on
the
floor.
What
about
the
scenario
wasn't
strange?
"The
word
'Draconian'?"
he
ventured,
offering
the
first
thing
that
came
to
mind.
Langdon
was
fairly
certain
that
a
reference
to
Draco
the
ruthless
seventh
century
B.C.
politician
was
an
unlikely
dying
thought.
"
'Draconian
devil'
seems
an
odd
choice
of
vocabulary."
"Draconian?"
Fache's
tone
came
with
a
tinge
of
impatience
now.
"Sauniere's
choice
of
vocabulary
hardly
seems
the
primary
issue
here."
Langdon
wasn't
sure
what
issue
Fache
had
in
mind,
but
he
was
starting
to
suspect
that
Draco
and
Fache
would
have
gotten
along
well.
"Sauniere
was
a
Frenchman,"
Fache
said
flatly.
"He
lived
in
Paris.
And
yet
he
chose
to
write
this
message"
"In
English,"
Langdon
said,
now
realizing
the
captain's
meaning.
Fache
nodded.
"Precisement.
Any
idea
why?"
Langdon
knew
Sauniere
spoke
impeccable
English,
and
yet
the
reason
he
had
chosen
English
as
the
language
in
which
to
write
his
final
words
escaped
Langdon.
He
shrugged.
Fache
motioned
back
to
the
pentacle
on
Sauniere's
abdomen.
"Nothing
to
do
with
devil
worship?
Are
you
still
certain?"
Langdon
was
certain
of
nothing
anymore.
"The
symbology
and
text
don't
seem
to
coincide.
I'm
sorry
I
can't
be
of
more
help."
"Perhaps
this
will
clarify."
Fache
backed
away
from
the
body
and
raised
the
black
light
again,
letting
the
beam
spread
out
in
a
wider
angle.
"And
now?"
To
Langdon's
amazement,
a
rudimentary
circle
glowed
around
the
curator's
body.
Sauniere
had
apparently
lay
down
and
swung
the
pen
around
himself
in
several
long
arcs,
essentially
inscribing
himself
inside
a
circle.
In
a
flash,
the
meaning
became
clear.
"The
Vitruvian
Man,
"
Langdon
gasped.
Sauniere
had
created
a
life
sized
replica
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci's
most
famous
sketch.
Considered
the
most
anatomically
correct
drawing
of
its
day,
Da
Vinci's
The
Vitruvian
Man
had
become
a
modern
day
icon
of
culture,
appearing
on
posters,
mouse
pads,
and
T
shirts
around
the
world.
The
celebrated
sketch
consisted
of
a
perfect
circle
in
which
was
inscribed
a
nude
male
his
arms
and
legs
outstretched
in
a
naked
spread
eagle.
Da
Vinci.
Langdon
felt
a
shiver
of
amazement.
The
clarity
of
Sauniere's
intentions
could
not
be
denied.
In
his
final
moments
of
life,
the
curator
had
stripped
off
his
clothing
and
arranged
his
body
in
a
clear
image
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci's
Vitruvian
Man.
The
circle
had
been
the
missing
critical
element.
A
feminine
symbol
of
protection,
the
circle
around
the
naked
man's
body
completed
Da
Vinci's
intended
message
male
and
female
harmony.
The
question
now,
though,
was
why
Sauniere
would
imitate
a
famous
drawing.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
Fache
said,
"certainly
a
man
like
yourself
is
aware
that
Leonardo
da
Vinci
had
a
tendency
toward
the
darker
arts."
Langdon
was
surprised
by
Fache's
knowledge
of
Da
Vinci,
and
it
certainly
went
a
long
way
toward
explaining
the
captain's
suspicions
about
devil
worship.
Da
Vinci
had
always
been
an
awkward
subject
for
historians,
especially
in
the
Christian
tradition.
Despite
the
visionary's
genius,
he
was
a
flamboyant
homosexual
and
worshipper
of
Nature's
divine
order,
both
of
which
placed
him
in
a
perpetual
state
of
sin
against
God.
Moreover,
the
artist's
eerie
eccentricities
projected
an
admittedly
demonic
aura:
Da
Vinci
exhumed
corpses
to
study
human
anatomy;
he
kept
mysterious
journals
in
illegible
reverse
handwriting;
he
believed
he
possessed
the
alchemic
power
to
turn
lead
into
gold
and
even
cheat
God
by
creating
an
elixir
to
postpone
death;
and
his
inventions
included
horrific,
never
before
imagined
weapons
of
war
and
torture.
Misunderstanding
breeds
distrust,
Langdon
thought.
Even
Da
Vinci's
enormous
output
of
breathtaking
Christian
art
only
furthered
the
artist's
reputation
for
spiritual
hypocrisy.
Accepting
hundreds
of
lucrative
Vatican
commissions,
Da
Vinci
painted
Christian
themes
not
as
an
expression
of
his
own
beliefs
but
rather
as
a
commercial
venture
a
means
of
funding
a
lavish
lifestyle.
Unfortunately,
Da
Vinci
was
a
prankster
who
often
amused
himself
by
quietly
gnawing
at
the
hand
that
fed
him.
He
incorporated
in
many
of
his
Christian
paintings
hidden
symbolism
that
was
anything
but
Christian
tributes
to
his
own
beliefs
and
a
subtle
thumbing
of
his
nose
at
the
Church.
Langdon
had
even
given
a
lecture
once
at
the
National
Gallery
in
London
entitled:
"The
Secret
Life
of
Leonardo:
Pagan
Symbolism
in
Christian
Art."
"I
understand
your
concerns,"
Langdon
now
said,
"but
Da
Vinci
never
really
practiced
any
dark
arts.
He
was
an
exceptionally
spiritual
man,
albeit
one
in
constant
conflict
with
the
Church."
As
Langdon
said
this,
an
odd
thought
popped
into
his
mind.
He
glanced
down
at
the
message
on
the
floor
again.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Oh,
lame
saint!
"Yes?"
Fache
said.
Langdon
weighed
his
words
carefully.
"I
was
just
thinking
that
Sauniere
shared
a
lot
of
spiritual
ideologies
with
Da
Vinci,
including
a
concern
over
the
Church's
elimination
of
the
sacred
feminine
from
modern
religion.
Maybe,
by
imitating
a
famous
Da
Vinci
drawing,
Sauniere
was
simply
echoing
some
of
their
shared
frustrations
with
the
modern
Church's
demonization
of
the
goddess."
Fache's
eyes
hardened.
"You
think
Sauniere
is
calling
the
Church
a
lame
saint
and
a
Draconian
devil?"
Langdon
had
to
admit
it
seemed
far
fetched,
and
yet
the
pentacle
seemed
to
endorse
the
idea
on
some
level.
"All
I
am
saying
is
that
Mr.
Sauniere
dedicated
his
life
to
studying
the
history
of
the
goddess,
and
nothing
has
done
more
to
erase
that
history
than
the
Catholic
Church.
It
seems
reasonable
that
Sauniere
might
have
chosen
to
express
his
disappointment
in
his
final
good
bye."
"Disappointment?"
Fache
demanded,
sounding
hostile
now.
"This
message
sounds
more
enraged
than
disappointed,
wouldn't
you
say?"
Langdon
was
reaching
the
end
of
his
patience.
"Captain,
you
asked
for
my
instincts
as
to
what
Sauniere
is
trying
to
say
here,
and
that's
what
I'm
giving
you."
"That
this
is
an
indictment
of
the
Church?"
Fache's
jaw
tightened
as
he
spoke
through
clenched
teeth.
"Mr.
Langdon,
I
have
seen
a
lot
of
death
in
my
work,
and
let
me
tell
you
something.
When
a
man
is
murdered
by
another
man,
I
do
not
believe
his
final
thoughts
are
to
write
an
obscure
spiritual
statement
that
no
one
will
understand.
I
believe
he
is
thinking
of
one
thing
only."
Fache's
whispery
voice
sliced
the
air.
"La
vengeance.
I
believe
Sauniere
wrote
this
note
to
tell
us
who
killed
him."
Langdon
stared.
"But
that
makes
no
sense
whatsoever."
"No?"
"No,"
he
fired
back,
tired
and
frustrated.
"You
told
me
Sauniere
was
attacked
in
his
office
by
someone
he
had
apparently
invited
in."
"Yes."
"So
it
seems
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
curator
knew
his
attacker."
Fache
nodded.
"Go
on."
"So
if
Sauniere
knew
the
person
who
killed
him,
what
kind
of
indictment
is
this?"
He
pointed
at
the
floor.
"Numeric
codes?
Lame
saints?
Draconian
devils?
Pentacles
on
his
stomach?
It's
all
too
cryptic."
Fache
frowned
as
if
the
idea
had
never
occurred
to
him.
"You
have
a
point."
"Considering
the
circumstances,"
Langdon
said,
"I
would
assume
that
if
Sauniere
wanted
to
tell
you
who
killed
him,
he
would
have
written
down
somebody's
name.
As
Langdon
spoke
those
words,
a
smug
smile
crossed
Fache's
lips
for
the
first
time
all
night.
"Precisement,
"
Fache
said.
"Precisement.
I
am
witnessing
the
work
of
a
master,
mused
Lieutenant
Collet
as
he
tweaked
his
audio
gear
and
listened
to
Fache's
voice
coming
through
the
headphones.
The
agent
superieur
knew
it
was
moments
like
these
that
had
lifted
the
captain
to
the
pinnacle
of
French
law
enforcement.
Fache
will
do
what
no
one
else
dares.
The
delicate
art
of
cajoler
was
a
lost
skill
in
modern
law
enforcement,
one
that
required
exceptional
poise
under
pressure.
Few
men
possessed
the
necessary
sangfroid
for
this
kind
of
operation,
but
Fache
seemed
born
for
it.
His
restraint
and
patience
bordered
on
the
robotic.
Fache's
sole
emotion
this
evening
seemed
to
be
one
of
intense
resolve,
as
if
this
arrest
were
somehow
personal
to
him.
Fache's
briefing
of
his
agents
an
hour
ago
had
been
unusually
succinct
and
assured.
know
who
murdered
Jacques
Sauniere,
Fache
had
said.
You
know
what
to
do.
No
mistakes
tonight.
And
so
far,
no
mistakes
had
been
made.
Collet
was
not
yet
privy
to
the
evidence
that
had
cemented
Fache's
certainty
of
their
suspect's
guilt,
but
he
knew
better
than
to
question
the
instincts
of
the
Bull.
Fache's
intuition
seemed
almost
supernatural
at
times.
God
whispers
in
his
ear,
one
agent
had
insisted
after
a
particularly
impressive
display
of
Fache's
sixth
sense.
Collet
had
to
admit,
if
there
was
a
God,
Bezu
Fache
would
be
on
His
A
list.
The
captain
attended
mass
and
confession
with
zealous
regularity
far
more
than
the
requisite
holiday
attendance
fulfilled
by
other
officials
in
the
name
of
good
public
relations.
When
the
Pope
visited
Paris
a
few
years
back,
Fache
had
used
all
his
muscle
to
obtain
the
honor
of
an
audience.
A
photo
of
Fache
with
the
Pope
now
hung
in
his
office.
The
Papal
Bull,
the
agents
secretly
called
it.
Collet
found
it
ironic
that
one
of
Fache's
rare
popular
public
stances
in
recent
years
had
been
his
outspoken
reaction
to
the
Catholic
pedophilia
scandal.
These
priests
should
be
hanged
twice!
Fache
had
declared.
Once
for
their
crimes
against
children.
And
once
for
shaming
the
good
name
of
the
Catholic
Church.
Collet
had
the
odd
sense
it
was
the
latter
that
angered
Fache
more.
Turning
now
to
his
laptop
computer,
Collet
attended
to
the
other
half
of
his
responsibilities
here
tonight
the
GPS
tracking
system.
The
image
onscreen
revealed
a
detailed
floor
plan
of
the
Denon
Wing,
a
structural
schematic
uploaded
from
the
Louvre
Security
Office.
Letting
his
eyes
trace
the
maze
of
galleries
and
hallways,
Collet
found
what
he
was
looking
for.
Deep
in
the
heart
of
the
Grand
Gallery
blinked
a
tiny
red
dot.
La
marque.
Fache
was
keeping
his
prey
on
a
very
tight
leash
tonight.
Wisely
so.
Robert
Langdon
had
proven
himself
one
cool
customer.
To
ensure
his
conversation
with
Mr.
Langdon
would
not
be
interrupted,
Bezu
Fache
had
turned
off
his
cellular
phone.
Unfortunately,
it
was
an
expensive
model
equipped
with
a
two
way
radio
feature,
which,
contrary
to
his
orders,
was
now
being
used
by
one
of
his
agents
to
page
him.
"Capitaine?"
The
phone
crackled
like
a
walkie
talkie.
Fache
felt
his
teeth
clench
in
rage.
He
could
imagine
nothing
important
enough
that
Collet
would
interrupt
this
surveillance
cachee
especially
at
this
critical
juncture.
He
gave
Langdon
a
calm
look
of
apology.
"One
moment
please."
He
pulled
the
phone
from
his
belt
and
pressed
the
radio
transmission
button.
"Oui?"
"Capitaine,
un
agent
du
Departement
de
Cryptographic
est
arrive.
Fache's
anger
stalled
momentarily.
A
cryptographer?
Despite
the
lousy
timing,
this
was
probably
good
news.
Fache,
after
finding
Sauniere's
cryptic
text
on
the
floor,
had
uploaded
photographs
of
the
entire
crime
scene
to
the
Cryptography
Department
in
hopes
someone
there
could
tell
him
what
the
hell
Sauniere
was
trying
to
say.
If
a
code
breaker
had
now
arrived,
it
most
likely
meant
someone
had
decrypted
Sauniere's
message.
"I'm
busy
at
the
moment,"
Fache
radioed
back,
leaving
no
doubt
in
his
tone
that
a
line
had
been
crossed.
"Ask
the
cryptographer
to
wait
at
the
command
post.
I'll
speak
to
him
when
I'm
done."
"Her,
"
the
voice
corrected.
"It's
Agent
Neveu."
Fache
was
becoming
less
amused
with
this
call
every
passing
moment.
Sophie
Neveu
was
one
of
DCPJ's
biggest
mistakes.
A
young
Parisian
dechiffreuse
who
had
studied
cryptography
in
England
at
the
Royal
Holloway,
Sophie
Neveu
had
been
foisted
on
Fache
two
years
ago
as
part
of
the
ministry's
attempt
to
incorporate
more
women
into
the
police
force.
The
ministry's
ongoing
foray
into
political
correctness,
Fache
argued,
was
weakening
the
department.
Women
not
only
lacked
the
physicality
necessary
for
police
work,
but
their
mere
presence
posed
a
dangerous
distraction
to
the
men
in
the
field.
As
Fache
had
feared,
Sophie
Neveu
was
proving
far
more
distracting
than
most.
At
thirty
two
years
old,
she
had
a
dogged
determination
that
bordered
on
obstinate.
Her
eager
espousal
of
Britain's
new
cryptologic
methodology
continually
exasperated
the
veteran
French
cryptographers
above
her.
And
by
far
the
most
troubling
to
Fache
was
the
inescapable
universal
truth
that
in
an
office
of
middle
aged
men,
an
attractive
young
woman
always
drew
eyes
away
from
the
work
at
hand.
The
man
on
the
radio
said,
"Agent
Neveu
insisted
on
speaking
to
you
immediately,
Captain.
I
tried
to
stop
her,
but
she's
on
her
way
into
the
gallery.
Fache
recoiled
in
disbelief.
"Unacceptable!
I
made
it
very
clear
For
a
moment,
Robert
Langdon
thought
Bezu
Fache
was
suffering
a
stroke.
The
captain
was
mid
sentence
when
his
jaw
stopped
moving
and
his
eyes
bulged.
His
blistering
gaze
seemed
fixated
on
something
over
Langdon's
shoulder.
Before
Langdon
could
turn
to
see
what
it
was,
he
heard
a
woman's
voice
chime
out
behind
him.
"Excusez
moi,
messieurs.
Langdon
turned
to
see
a
young
woman
approaching.
She
was
moving
down
the
corridor
toward
them
with
long,
fluid
strides
a
haunting
certainty
to
her
gait.
Dressed
casually
in
a
knee
length,
cream
colored
Irish
sweater
over
black
leggings,
she
was
attractive
and
looked
to
be
about
thirty.
Her
thick
burgundy
hair
fell
unstyled
to
her
shoulders,
framing
the
warmth
of
her
face.
Unlike
the
waifish,
cookie
cutter
blondes
that
adorned
Harvard
dorm
room
walls,
this
woman
was
healthy
with
an
unembellished
beauty
and
genuineness
that
radiated
a
striking
personal
confidence.
To
Langdon's
surprise,
the
woman
walked
directly
up
to
him
and
extended
a
polite
hand.
"Monsieur
Langdon,
I
am
Agent
Neveu
from
DCPJ's
Cryptology
Department."
Her
words
curved
richly
around
her
muted
Anglo
Franco
accent.
"It
is
a
pleasure
to
meet
you."
Langdon
took
her
soft
palm
in
his
and
felt
himself
momentarily
fixed
in
her
strong
gaze.
Her
eyes
were
olive
green
incisive
and
clear.
Fache
drew
a
seething
inhalation,
clearly
preparing
to
launch
into
a
reprimand.
"Captain,"
she
said,
turning
quickly
and
beating
him
to
the
punch,
"please
excuse
the
interruption,
but"
"Ce
n
'est
pas
le
moment!"
Fache
sputtered.
"I
tried
to
phone
you."
Sophie
continued
in
English,
as
if
out
of
courtesy
to
Langdon.
"But
your
cell
phone
was
turned
off.
"I
turned
it
off
for
a
reason,"
Fache
hissed.
"I
am
speaking
to
Mr.
Langdon."
"I've
deciphered
the
numeric
code,"
she
said
flatly.
Langdon
felt
a
pulse
of
excitement.
She
broke
the
code
?
Fache
looked
uncertain
how
to
respond.
"Before
I
explain,"
Sophie
said,
"I
have
an
urgent
message
for
Mr.
Langdon."
Fache's
expression
turned
to
one
of
deepening
concern.
"For
Mr.
Langdon?"
She
nodded,
turning
back
to
Langdon.
"You
need
to
contact
the
U.S.
Embassy,
Mr.
Langdon.
They
have
a
message
for
you
from
the
States."
Langdon
reacted
with
surprise,
his
excitement
over
the
code
giving
way
to
a
sudden
ripple
of
concern.
A
message
from
the
States?
He
tried
to
imagine
who
could
be
trying
to
reach
him.
Only
a
few
of
his
colleagues
knew
he
was
in
Paris.
Fache's
broad
jaw
had
tightened
with
the
news.
"The
U.S.
Embassy?"
he
demanded,
sounding
suspicious.
"How
would
they
know
to
find
Mr.
Langdon
here?"
Sophie
shrugged.
"Apparently
they
called
Mr.
Langdon's
hotel,
and
the
concierge
told
them
Mr.
Langdon
had
been
collected
by
a
DCPJ
agent."
Fache
looked
troubled.
"And
the
embassy
contacted
DCPJ
Cryptography?"
"No,
sir,"
Sophie
said,
her
voice
firm.
"When
I
called
the
DCPJ
switchboard
in
an
attempt
to
contact
you,
they
had
a
message
waiting
for
Mr.
Langdon
and
asked
me
to
pass
it
along
if
I
got
through
to
you."
Fache's
brow
furrowed
in
apparent
confusion.
He
opened
his
mouth
to
speak,
but
Sophie
had
already
turned
back
to
Langdon.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
she
declared,
pulling
a
small
slip
of
paper
from
her
pocket,
"this
is
the
number
for
your
embassy's
messaging
service.
They
asked
that
you
phone
in
as
soon
as
possible."
She
handed
him
the
paper
with
an
intent
gaze.
"While
I
explain
the
code
to
Captain
Fache,
you
need
to
make
this
call."
Langdon
studied
the
slip.
It
had
a
Paris
phone
number
and
extension
on
it.
"Thank
you,"
he
said,
feeling
worried
now.
"Where
do
I
find
a
phone?"
Sophie
began
to
pull
a
cell
phone
from
her
sweater
pocket,
but
Fache
waved
her
off.
He
now
looked
like
Mount
Vesuvius
about
to
erupt.
Without
taking
his
eyes
off
Sophie,
he
produced
his
own
cell
phone
and
held
it
out.
"This
line
is
secure,
Mr.
Langdon.
You
may
use
it."
Langdon
felt
mystified
by
Fache's
anger
with
the
young
woman.
Feeling
uneasy,
he
accepted
the
captain's
phone.
Fache
immediately
marched
Sophie
several
steps
away
and
began
chastising
her
in
hushed
tones.
Disliking
the
captain
more
and
more,
Langdon
turned
away
from
the
odd
confrontation
and
switched
on
the
cell
phone.
Checking
the
slip
of
paper
Sophie
had
given
him,
Langdon
dialed
the
number.
The
line
began
to
ring.
One
ring
two
rings
three
rings
Finally
the
call
connected.
Langdon
expected
to
hear
an
embassy
operator,
but
he
found
himself
instead
listening
to
an
answering
machine.
Oddly,
the
voice
on
the
tape
was
familiar.
It
was
that
of
Sophie
Neveu.
"Bonjour,
vous
etes
bien
chez
Sophie
Neveu,
"
the
woman's
voice
said.
"Je
suis
absenle
pour
le
moment,
mais"
Confused,
Langdon
turned
back
toward
Sophie.
"I'm
sorry,
Ms.
Neveu?
I
think
you
may
have
given
me
"No,
that's
the
right
number,"
Sophie
interjected
quickly,
as
if
anticipating
Langdon's
confusion.
"The
embassy
has
an
automated
message
system.
You
have
to
dial
an
access
code
to
pick
up
your
messages.
Langdon
stared.
"But
"It's
the
three
digit
code
on
the
paper
I
gave
you."
Langdon
opened
his
mouth
to
explain
the
bizarre
error,
but
Sophie
flashed
him
a
silencing
glare
that
lasted
only
an
instant.
Her
green
eyes
sent
a
crystal
clear
message.
Don
't
ask
questions.
Just
do
it.
Bewildered,
Langdon
punched
in
the
extension
on
the
slip
of
paper:
454.
Sophie's
outgoing
message
immediately
cut
off,
and
Langdon
heard
an
electronic
voice
announce
in
French:
"You
have
one
new
message."
Apparently,
454
was
Sophie's
remote
access
code
for
picking
up
her
messages
while
away
from
home.
I'm
picking
up
this
woman's
messages?
Langdon
could
hear
the
tape
rewinding
now.
Finally,
it
stopped,
and
the
machine
engaged.
Langdon
listened
as
the
message
began
to
play.
Again,
the
voice
on
the
line
was
Sophie's.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
the
message
began
in
a
fearful
whisper.
"Do
not
react
to
this
message.
Just
listen
calmly.
You
are
in
danger
right
now.
Follow
my
directions
very
closely."
Silas
sat
behind
the
wheel
of
the
black
Audi
the
Teacher
had
arranged
for
him
and
gazed
out
at
the
great
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice.
Lit
from
beneath
by
banks
of
floodlights,
the
church's
two
bell
towers
rose
like
stalwart
sentinels
above
the
building's
long
body.
On
either
flank,
a
shadowy
row
of
sleek
buttresses
jutted
out
like
the
ribs
of
a
beautiful
beast.
The
heathens
used
a
house
of
God
to
conceal
their
keystone.
Again
the
brotherhood
had
confirmed
their
legendary
reputation
for
illusion
and
deceit.
Silas
was
looking
forward
to
finding
the
keystone
and
giving
it
to
the
Teacher
so
they
could
recover
what
the
brotherhood
had
long
ago
stolen
from
the
faithful.
How
powerful
that
will
make
Opus
Dei.
Parking
the
Audi
on
the
deserted
Place
Saint
Sulpice,
Silas
exhaled,
telling
himself
to
clear
his
mind
for
the
task
at
hand.
His
broad
back
still
ached
from
the
corporal
mortification
he
had
endured
earlier
today,
and
yet
the
pain
was
inconsequential
compared
with
the
anguish
of
his
life
before
Opus
Dei
had
saved
him.
Still,
the
memories
haunted
his
soul.
Release
your
hatred,
Silas
commanded
himself.
Forgive
those
who
trespassed
against
you.
Looking
up
at
the
stone
towers
of
Saint
Sulpice,
Silas
fought
that
familiar
undertow
that
force
that
often
dragged
his
mind
back
in
time,
locking
him
once
again
in
the
prison
that
had
been
his
world
as
a
young
man.
The
memories
of
purgatory
came
as
they
always
did,
like
a
tempest
to
his
senses
the
reek
of
rotting
cabbage,
the
stench
of
death,
human
urine
and
feces.
The
cries
of
hopelessness
against
the
howling
wind
of
the
Pyrenees
and
the
soft
sobs
of
forgotten
men.
Andorra,
he
thought,
feeling
his
muscles
tighten.
Incredibly,
it
was
in
that
barren
and
forsaken
suzerain
between
Spain
and
France,
shivering
in
his
stone
cell,
wanting
only
to
die,
that
Silas
had
been
saved.
He
had
not
realized
it
at
the
time.
The
light
came
long
after
the
thunder.
His
name
was
not
Silas
then,
although
he
didn't
recall
the
name
his
parents
had
given
him.
He
had
left
home
when
he
was
seven.
His
drunken
father,
a
burly
dockworker,
enraged
by
the
arrival
of
an
albino
son,
beat
his
mother
regularly,
blaming
her
for
the
boy's
embarrassing
condition.
When
the
boy
tried
to
defend
her,
he
too
was
badly
beaten.
One
night,
there
was
a
horrific
fight,
and
his
mother
never
got
up.
The
boy
stood
over
his
lifeless
mother
and
felt
an
unbearable
up
welling
of
guilt
for
permitting
it
to
happen.
This
is
my
fault!
As
if
some
kind
of
demon
were
controlling
his
body,
the
boy
walked
to
the
kitchen
and
grasped
a
butcher
knife.
Hypnotically,
he
moved
to
the
bedroom
where
his
father
lay
on
the
bed
in
a
drunken
stupor.
Without
a
word,
the
boy
stabbed
him
in
the
back.
His
father
cried
out
in
pain
and
tried
to
roll
over,
but
his
son
stabbed
him
again,
over
and
over
until
the
apartment
fell
quiet.
The
boy
fled
home
but
found
the
streets
of
Marseilles
equally
unfriendly.
His
strange
appearance
made
him
an
outcast
among
the
other
young
runaways,
and
he
was
forced
to
live
alone
in
the
basement
of
a
dilapidated
factory,
eating
stolen
fruit
and
raw
fish
from
the
dock.
His
only
companions
were
tattered
magazines
he
found
in
the
trash,
and
he
taught
himself
to
read
them.
Over
time,
he
grew
strong.
When
he
was
twelve,
another
drifter
a
girl
twice
his
age
mocked
him
on
the
streets
and
attempted
to
steal
his
food.
The
girl
found
herself
pummeled
to
within
inches
of
her
life.
When
the
authorities
pulled
the
boy
off
her,
they
gave
him
an
ultimatum
leave
Marseilles
or
go
to
juvenile
prison.
The
boy
moved
down
the
coast
to
Toulon.
Over
time,
the
looks
of
pity
on
the
streets
turned
to
looks
of
fear.
The
boy
had
grown
to
a
powerful
young
man.
When
people
passed
by,
he
could
hear
them
whispering
to
one
another.
A
ghost,
they
would
say,
their
eyes
wide
with
fright
as
they
stared
at
his
white
skin.
A
ghost
with
the
eyes
of
a
devil!
And
he
felt
like
a
ghost
transparent
floating
from
seaport
to
seaport.
People
seemed
to
look
right
through
him.
At
eighteen,
in
a
port
town,
while
attempting
to
steal
a
case
of
cured
ham
from
a
cargo
ship,
he
was
caught
by
a
pair
of
crewmen.
The
two
sailors
who
began
to
beat
him
smelled
of
beer,
just
as
his
father
had.
The
memories
of
fear
and
hatred
surfaced
like
a
monster
from
the
deep.
The
young
man
broke
the
first
sailor's
neck
with
his
bare
hands,
and
only
the
arrival
of
the
police
saved
the
second
sailor
from
a
similar
fate.
Two
months
later,
in
shackles,
he
arrived
at
a
prison
in
Andorra.
You
are
as
white
as
a
ghost,
the
inmates
ridiculed
as
the
guards
marched
him
in,
naked
and
cold.
Mira
el
espectro!
Perhaps
the
ghost
will
pass
right
through
these
walls!
Over
the
course
of
twelve
years,
his
flesh
and
soul
withered
until
he
knew
he
had
become
transparent.
am
a
ghost.
I
am
weightless.
Yo
soy
un
espectro
palido
coma
unafantasma
caminando
este
mundo
a
solas.
One
night
the
ghost
awoke
to
the
screams
of
other
inmates.
He
didn't
know
what
invisible
force
was
shaking
the
floor
on
which
he
slept,
nor
what
mighty
hand
was
trembling
the
mortar
of
his
stone
cell,
but
as
he
jumped
to
his
feet,
a
large
boulder
toppled
onto
the
very
spot
where
he
had
been
sleeping.
Looking
up
to
see
where
the
stone
had
come
from,
he
saw
a
hole
in
the
trembling
wall,
and
beyond
it,
a
vision
he
had
not
seen
in
over
ten
years.
The
moon.
Even
while
the
earth
still
shook,
the
ghost
found
himself
scrambling
through
a
narrow
tunnel,
staggering
out
into
an
expansive
vista,
and
tumbling
down
a
barren
mountainside
into
the
woods.
He
ran
all
night,
always
downward,
delirious
with
hunger
and
exhaustion.
Skirting
the
edges
of
consciousness,
he
found
himself
at
dawn
in
a
clearing
where
train
tracks
cut
a
swath
across
the
forest.
Following
the
rails,
he
moved
on
as
if
dreaming.
Seeing
an
empty
freight
car,
he
crawled
in
for
shelter
and
rest.
When
he
awoke
the
train
was
moving.
How
long?
How
far?
A
pain
was
growing
in
his
gut.
Am
I
dying
?
He
slept
again.
This
time
he
awoke
to
someone
yelling,
beating
him,
throwing
him
out
of
the
freight
car.
Bloody,
he
wandered
the
outskirts
of
a
small
village
looking
in
vain
for
food.
Finally,
his
body
too
weak
to
take
another
step,
he
lay
down
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
slipped
into
unconsciousness.
The
light
came
slowly,
and
the
ghost
wondered
how
long
he
had
been
dead.
A
day?
Three
days?
It
didn't
matter.
His
bed
was
soft
like
a
cloud,
and
the
air
around
him
smelled
sweet
with
candles.
Jesus
was
there,
staring
down
at
him.
am
here,
Jesus
said.
The
stone
has
been
rolled
aside,
and
you
are
born
again.
He
slept
and
awoke.
Fog
shrouded
his
thoughts.
He
had
never
believed
in
heaven,
and
yet
Jesus
was
watching
over
him.
Food
appeared
beside
his
bed,
and
the
ghost
ate
it,
almost
able
to
feel
the
flesh
materializing
on
his
bones.
He
slept
again.
When
he
awoke,
Jesus
was
still
smiling
down,
speaking.
You
are
saved,
my
son.
Blessed
are
those
who
follow
my
path.
Again,
he
slept.
It
was
a
scream
of
anguish
that
startled
the
ghost
from
his
slumber.
His
body
leapt
out
of
bed,
staggered
down
a
hallway
toward
the
sounds
of
shouting.
He
entered
into
a
kitchen
and
saw
a
large
man
beating
a
smaller
man.
Without
knowing
why,
the
ghost
grabbed
the
large
man
and
hurled
him
backward
against
a
wall.
The
man
fled,
leaving
the
ghost
standing
over
the
body
of
a
young
man
in
priest's
robes.
The
priest
had
a
badly
shattered
nose.
Lifting
the
bloody
priest,
the
ghost
carried
him
to
a
couch.
"Thank
you,
my
friend,"
the
priest
said
in
awkward
French.
"The
offertory
money
is
tempting
for
thieves.
You
speak
French
in
your
sleep.
Do
you
also
speak
Spanish?"
The
ghost
shook
his
head.
"What
is
your
name?"
he
continued
in
broken
French.
The
ghost
could
not
remember
the
name
his
parents
had
given
him.
All
he
heard
were
the
taunting
gibes
of
the
prison
guards.
The
priest
smiled.
"No
hay
problema.
My
name
is
Manuel
Aringarosa.
I
am
a
missionary
from
Madrid.
I
was
sent
here
to
build
a
church
for
the
Obra
de
Dios."
"Where
am
I?"
His
voice
sounded
hollow.
"Oviedo.
In
the
north
of
Spain."
"How
did
I
get
here?"
"Someone
left
you
on
my
doorstep.
You
were
ill.
I
fed
you.
You've
been
here
many
days."
The
ghost
studied
his
young
caretaker.
Years
had
passed
since
anyone
had
shown
any
kindness.
"Thank
you,
Father."
The
priest
touched
his
bloody
lip.
"It
is
I
who
am
thankful,
my
friend."
When
the
ghost
awoke
in
the
morning,
his
world
felt
clearer.
He
gazed
up
at
the
crucifix
on
the
wall
above
his
bed.
Although
it
no
longer
spoke
to
him,
he
felt
a
comforting
aura
in
its
presence.
Sitting
up,
he
was
surprised
to
find
a
newspaper
clipping
on
his
bedside
table.
The
article
was
in
French,
a
week
old.
When
he
read
the
story,
he
filled
with
fear.
It
told
of
an
earthquake
in
the
mountains
that
had
destroyed
a
prison
and
freed
many
dangerous
criminals.
His
heart
began
pounding.
The
priest
knows
who
I
am!
The
emotion
he
felt
was
one
he
had
not
felt
for
some
time.
Shame.
Guilt.
It
was
accompanied
by
the
fear
of
being
caught.
He
jumped
from
his
bed.
Where
do
I
run
?
"The
Book
of
Acts,"
a
voice
said
from
the
door.
The
ghost
turned,
frightened.
The
young
priest
was
smiling
as
he
entered.
His
nose
was
awkwardly
bandaged,
and
he
was
holding
out
an
old
Bible.
"I
found
one
in
French
for
you.
The
chapter
is
marked."
Uncertain,
the
ghost
took
the
Bible
and
looked
at
the
chapter
the
priest
had
marked.
Acts
16.
The
verses
told
of
a
prisoner
named
Silas
who
lay
naked
and
beaten
in
his
cell,
singing
hymns
to
God.
When
the
ghost
reached
Verse
26,
he
gasped
in
shock.
"
And
suddenly,
there
was
a
great
earthquake,
so
that
the
foundations
of
the
prison
were
shaken,
and
all
the
doors
fell
open.
His
eyes
shot
up
at
the
priest.
The
priest
smiled
warmly.
"From
now
on,
my
friend,
if
you
have
no
other
name,
I
shall
call
you
Silas."
The
ghost
nodded
blankly.
Silas.
He
had
been
given
flesh.
My
name
is
Silas.
"It's
time
for
breakfast,"
the
priest
said.
"You
will
need
your
strength
if
you
are
to
help
me
build
this
church."
Twenty
thousand
feet
above
the
Mediterranean,
Alitalia
flight
1618
bounced
in
turbulence,
causing
passengers
to
shift
nervously.
Bishop
Aringarosa
barely
noticed.
His
thoughts
were
with
the
future
of
Opus
Dei.
Eager
to
know
how
plans
in
Paris
were
progressing,
he
wished
he
could
phone
Silas.
But
he
could
not.
The
Teacher
had
seen
to
that.
"It
is
for
your
own
safety,"
the
Teacher
had
explained,
speaking
in
English
with
a
French
accent.
"I
am
familiar
enough
with
electronic
communications
to
know
they
can
be
intercepted.
The
results
could
be
disastrous
for
you.
Aringarosa
knew
he
was
right.
The
Teacher
seemed
an
exceptionally
careful
man.
He
had
not
revealed
his
own
identity
to
Aringarosa,
and
yet
he
had
proven
himself
a
man
well
worth
obeying.
After
all,
he
had
somehow
obtained
very
secret
information.
The
names
of
the
brotherhood'
s
four
top
members!
This
had
been
one
of
the
coups
that
convinced
the
bishop
the
Teacher
was
truly
capable
of
delivering
the
astonishing
prize
he
claimed
he
could
unearth.
"Bishop,"
the
Teacher
had
told
him,
"I
have
made
all
the
arrangements.
For
my
plan
to
succeed,
you
must
allow
Silas
to
answer
only
to
me
for
several
days.
The
two
of
you
will
not
speak.
I
will
communicate
with
him
through
secure
channels."
"You
will
treat
him
with
respect?"
"A
man
of
faith
deserves
the
highest."
"Excellent.
Then
I
understand.
Silas
and
I
shall
not
speak
until
this
is
over."
"I
do
this
to
protect
your
identity,
Silas's
identity,
and
my
investment."
"Your
investment?"
"Bishop,
if
your
own
eagerness
to
keep
abreast
of
progress
puts
you
in
jail,
then
you
will
be
unable
to
pay
me
my
fee."
The
bishop
smiled.
"A
fine
point.
Our
desires
are
in
accord.
Godspeed."
Twenty
million
euro,
the
bishop
thought,
now
gazing
out
the
plane's
window.
The
sum
was
approximately
the
same
number
of
U.S.
dollars.
A
pittance
for
something
so
powerful.
He
felt
a
renewed
confidence
that
the
Teacher
and
Silas
would
not
fail.
Money
and
faith
were
powerful
motivators.
"Une
plaisanterie
numerique?"
Bezu
Fache
was
livid,
glaring
at
Sophie
Neveu
in
disbelief.
A
numeric
joke?
"Your
professional
assessment
of
Sauniere's
code
is
that
it
is
some
kind
of
mathematical
prank?"
Fache
was
in
utter
incomprehension
of
this
woman's
gall.
Not
only
had
she
just
barged
in
on
Fache
without
permission,
but
she
was
now
trying
to
convince
him
that
Sauniere,
in
his
final
moments
of
life,
had
been
inspired
to
leave
a
mathematical
gag?
"This
code,"
Sophie
explained
in
rapid
French,
"is
simplistic
to
the
point
of
absurdity.
Jacques
Sauniere
must
have
known
we
would
see
through
it
immediately."
She
pulled
a
scrap
of
paper
from
her
sweater
pocket
and
handed
it
to
Fache.
"Here
is
the
decryption."
Fache
looked
at
the
card.

"This
is
it?"
he
snapped.
"All
you
did
was
put
the
numbers
in
increasing
order!"
Sophie
actually
had
the
nerve
to
give
a
satisfied
smile.
"Exactly."
Fache's
tone
lowered
to
a
guttural
rumble.
"Agent
Neveu,
I
have
no
idea
where
the
hell
you're
going
with
this,
but
I
suggest
you
get
there
fast."
He
shot
an
anxious
glance
at
Langdon,
who
stood
nearby
with
the
phone
pressed
to
his
ear,
apparently
still
listening
to
his
phone
message
from
the
U.S.
Embassy.
From
Langdon's
ashen
expression,
Fache
sensed
the
news
was
bad.
"Captain,"
Sophie
said,
her
tone
dangerously
defiant,
"the
sequence
of
numbers
you
have
in
your
hand
happens
to
be
one
of
the
most
famous
mathematical
progressions
in
history."
Fache
was
not
aware
there
even
existed
a
mathematical
progression
that
qualified
as
famous,
and
he
certainly
didn't
appreciate
Sophie's
off
handed
tone.
"This
is
the
Fibonacci
sequence,"
she
declared,
nodding
toward
the
piece
of
paper
in
Fache's
hand.
"A
progression
in
which
each
term
is
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
two
preceding
terms."
Fache
studied
the
numbers.
Each
term
was
indeed
the
sum
of
the
two
previous,
and
yet
Fache
could
not
imagine
what
the
relevance
of
all
this
was
to
Sauniere's
death.
"Mathematician
Leonardo
Fibonacci
created
this
succession
of
numbers
in
the
thirteenth
century.
Obviously
there
can
be
no
coincidence
that
all
of
the
numbers
Sauniere
wrote
on
the
floor
belong
to
Fibonacci's
famous
sequence."
Fache
stared
at
the
young
woman
for
several
moments.
"Fine,
if
there
is
no
coincidence,
would
you
tell
me
why
Jacques
Sauniere
chose
to
do
this.
What
is
he
saying?
What
does
this
mean?"
She
shrugged.
"Absolutely
nothing.
That's
the
point.
It's
a
simplistic
cryptographic
joke.
Like
taking
the
words
of
a
famous
poem
and
shuffling
them
at
random
to
see
if
anyone
recognizes
what
all
the
words
have
in
common."
Fache
took
a
menacing
step
forward,
placing
his
face
only
inches
from
Sophie's.
"I
certainly
hope
you
have
a
much
more
satisfying
explanation
than
that.
Sophie's
soft
features
grew
surprisingly
stern
as
she
leaned
in.
"Captain,
considering
what
you
have
at
stake
here
tonight,
I
thought
you
might
appreciate
knowing
that
Jacques
Sauniere
might
be
playing
games
with
you.
Apparently
not.
I'll
inform
the
director
of
Cryptography
you
no
longer
need
our
services."
With
that,
she
turned
on
her
heel,
and
marched
off
the
way
she
had
come.
Stunned,
Fache
watched
her
disappear
into
the
darkness.
Is
she
out
of
her
mind?
Sophie
Neveu
had
just
redefined
le
suicide
professionnel.
Fache
turned
to
Langdon,
who
was
still
on
the
phone,
looking
more
concerned
than
before,
listening
intently
to
his
phone
message.
The
U.S.
Embassy.
Bezu
Fache
despised
many
things
but
few
drew
more
wrath
than
the
U.S.
Embassy.
Fache
and
the
ambassador
locked
horns
regularly
over
shared
affairs
of
state
their
most
common
battleground
being
law
enforcement
for
visiting
Americans.
Almost
daily,
DCPJ
arrested
American
exchange
students
in
possession
of
drugs,
U.S.
businessmen
for
soliciting
underage
Prostitutes,
American
tourists
for
shoplifting
or
destruction
of
property.
Legally,
the
U.S.
Embassy
could
intervene
and
extradite
guilty
citizens
back
to
the
United
States,
where
they
received
nothing
more
than
a
slap
on
the
wrist.
And
the
embassy
invariably
did
just
that.
L
'emasculation
de
la
Police
Judiciaire,
Fache
called
it.
Paris
Match
had
run
a
cartoon
recently
depicting
Fache
as
a
police
dog,
trying
to
bite
an
American
criminal,
but
unable
to
reach
because
it
was
chained
to
the
U.S.
Embassy.
Not
tonight,
Fache
told
himself.
There
is
far
too
much
at
stake.
By
the
time
Robert
Langdon
hung
up
the
phone,
he
looked
ill.
"Is
everything
all
right?"
Fache
asked.
Weakly,
Langdon
shook
his
head.
Bad
news
from
home,
Fache
sensed,
noticing
Langdon
was
sweating
slightly
as
Fache
took
back
his
cell
phone.
"An
accident,"
Langdon
stammered,
looking
at
Fache
with
a
strange
expression.
"A
friend"
He
hesitated.
"I'll
need
to
fly
home
first
thing
in
the
morning."
Fache
had
no
doubt
the
shock
on
Langdon's
face
was
genuine,
and
yet
he
sensed
another
emotion
there
too,
as
if
a
distant
fear
were
suddenly
simmering
in
the
American's
eyes.
"I'm
sorry
to
hear
that,"
Fache
said,
watching
Langdon
closely.
"Would
you
like
to
sit
down?"
He
motioned
toward
one
of
the
viewing
benches
in
the
gallery.
Langdon
nodded
absently
and
took
a
few
steps
toward
the
bench.
He
paused,
looking
more
confused
with
every
moment.
"Actually,
I
think
I'd
like
to
use
the
rest
room."
Fache
frowned
inwardly
at
the
delay.
"The
rest
room.
Of
course.
Let's
take
a
break
for
a
few
minutes."
He
motioned
back
down
the
long
hallway
in
the
direction
they
had
come
from.
"The
rest
rooms
are
back
toward
the
curator's
office."
Langdon
hesitated,
pointing
in
the
other
direction
toward
the
far
end
of
the
Grand
Gallery
corridor.
"I
believe
there's
a
much
closer
rest
room
at
the
end."
Fache
realized
Langdon
was
right.
They
were
two
thirds
of
the
way
down,
and
the
Grand
Gallery
dead
ended
at
a
pair
of
rest
rooms.
"Shall
I
accompany
you?"
Langdon
shook
his
head,
already
moving
deeper
into
the
gallery.
"Not
necessary.
I
think
I'd
like
a
few
minutes
alone."
Fache
was
not
wild
about
the
idea
of
Langdon
wandering
alone
down
the
remaining
length
of
corridor,
but
he
took
comfort
in
knowing
the
Grand
Gallery
was
a
dead
end
whose
only
exit
was
at
the
other
end
the
gate
under
which
they
had
entered.
Although
French
fire
regulations
required
several
emergency
stairwells
for
a
space
this
large,
those
stairwells
had
been
sealed
automatically
when
Sauniere
tripped
the
security
system.
Granted,
that
system
had
now
been
reset,
unlocking
the
stairwells,
but
it
didn't
matter
the
external
doors,
if
opened,
would
set
off
fire
alarms
and
were
guarded
outside
by
DCPJ
agents.
Langdon
could
not
possibly
leave
without
Fache
knowing
about
it.
"I
need
to
return
to
Mr.
Sauniere's
office
for
a
moment,"
Fache
said.
"Please
come
find
me
directly,
Mr.
Langdon.
There
is
more
we
need
to
discuss."
Langdon
gave
a
quiet
wave
as
he
disappeared
into
the
darkness.
Turning,
Fache
marched
angrily
in
the
opposite
direction.
Arriving
at
the
gate,
he
slid
under,
exited
the
Grand
Gallery,
marched
down
the
hall,
and
stormed
into
the
command
center
at
Sauniere's
office.
"Who
gave
the
approval
to
let
Sophie
Neveu
into
this
building!"
Fache
bellowed.
Collet
was
the
first
to
answer.
"She
told
the
guards
outside
she'd
broken
the
code."
Fache
looked
around.
"Is
she
gone?"
"She's
not
with
you?"
"She
left."
Fache
glanced
out
at
the
darkened
hallway.
Apparently
Sophie
had
been
in
no
mood
to
stop
by
and
chat
with
the
other
officers
on
her
way
out.
For
a
moment,
Fache
considered
radioing
the
guards
in
the
entresol
and
telling
them
to
stop
Sophie
and
drag
her
back
up
here
before
she
could
leave
the
premises.
He
thought
better
of
it.
That
was
only
his
pride
talking
wanting
the
last
word.
He'd
had
enough
distractions
tonight.
Deal
with
Agent
Neveu
later,
he
told
himself,
already
looking
forward
to
firing
her.
Pushing
Sophie
from
his
mind,
Fache
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
miniature
knight
standing
on
Sauniere's
desk.
Then
he
turned
back
to
Collet.
"Do
you
have
him?"
Collet
gave
a
curt
nod
and
spun
the
laptop
toward
Fache.
The
red
dot
was
clearly
visible
on
the
floor
plan
overlay,
blinking
methodically
in
a
room
marked
TOILETTES
PUBLIQUES.
"Good,"
Fache
said,
lighting
a
cigarette
and
stalking
into
the
hall.
I've
got
a
phone
call
to
make.
Be
damned
sure
the
rest
room
is
the
only
place
Langdon
goes."
Robert
Langdon
felt
light
headed
as
he
trudged
toward
the
end
of
the
Grand
Gallery.
Sophie's
phone
message
played
over
and
over
in
his
mind.
At
the
end
of
the
corridor,
illuminated
signs
bearing
the
international
stick
figure
symbols
for
rest
rooms
guided
him
through
a
maze
like
series
of
dividers
displaying
Italian
drawings
and
hiding
the
rest
rooms
from
sight.
Finding
the
men's
room
door,
Langdon
entered
and
turned
on
the
lights.
The
room
was
empty.
Walking
to
the
sink,
he
splashed
cold
water
on
his
face
and
tried
to
wake
up.
Harsh
fluorescent
lights
glared
off
the
stark
tile,
and
the
room
smelled
of
ammonia.
As
he
toweled
off,
the
rest
room's
door
creaked
open
behind
him.
He
spun.
Sophie
Neveu
entered,
her
green
eyes
flashing
fear.
"Thank
God
you
came.
We
don't
have
much
time."
Langdon
stood
beside
the
sinks,
staring
in
bewilderment
at
DCPJ
cryptographer
Sophie
Neveu.
Only
minutes
ago,
Langdon
had
listened
to
her
phone
message,
thinking
the
newly
arrived
cryptographer
must
be
insane.
And
yet,
the
more
he
listened,
the
more
he
sensed
Sophie
Neveu
was
speaking
in
earnest.
Do
not
react
to
this
message.
Just
listen
calmly.
You
are
in
danger
right
now.
Follow
my
directions
very
closely.
Filled
with
uncertainty,
Langdon
had
decided
to
do
exactly
as
Sophie
advised.
He
told
Fache
that
the
phone
message
was
regarding
an
injured
friend
back
home.
Then
he
had
asked
to
use
the
rest
room
at
the
end
of
the
Grand
Gallery.
Sophie
stood
before
him
now,
still
catching
her
breath
after
doubling
back
to
the
rest
room.
In
the
fluorescent
lights,
Langdon
was
surprised
to
see
that
her
strong
air
actually
radiated
from
unexpectedly
soft
features.
Only
her
gaze
was
sharp,
and
the
juxtaposition
conjured
images
of
a
multilayered
Renoir
portrait
veiled
but
distinct,
with
a
boldness
that
somehow
retained
its
shroud
of
mystery.
"I
wanted
to
warn
you,
Mr.
Langdon"
Sophie
began,
still
catching
her
breath,
"that
you
are
sous
surveillance
cachee.
Under
a
guarded
observation."
As
she
spoke,
her
accented
English
resonated
off
the
tile
walls,
giving
her
voice
a
hollow
quality.
"But
why?"
Langdon
demanded.
Sophie
had
already
given
him
an
explanation
on
the
phone,
but
he
wanted
to
hear
it
from
her
lips.
"Because,"
she
said,
stepping
toward
him,
"Fache's
primary
suspect
in
this
murder
is
you.
Langdon
was
braced
for
the
words,
and
yet
they
still
sounded
utterly
ridiculous.
According
to
Sophie,
Langdon
had
been
called
to
the
Louvre
tonight
not
as
a
symbologist
but
rather
as
a
suspect
and
was
currently
the
unwitting
target
of
one
of
DCPJ's
favorite
interrogation
methods
surveillance
cachee
a
deft
deception
in
which
the
police
calmly
invited
a
suspect
to
a
crime
scene
and
interviewed
him
in
hopes
he
would
get
nervous
and
mistakenly
incriminate
himself.
"Look
in
your
jacket's
left
pocket,"
Sophie
said.
"You'll
find
proof
they
are
watching
you."
Langdon
felt
his
apprehension
rising.
Look
in
my
pocket?
It
sounded
like
some
kind
of
cheap
magic
trick.
"Just
look."
Bewildered,
Langdon
reached
his
hand
into
his
tweed
jacket's
left
pocket
one
he
never
used.
Feeling
around
inside,
he
found
nothing.
What
the
devil
did
you
expect?
He
began
wondering
if
Sophie
might
just
be
insane
after
all.
Then
his
fingers
brushed
something
unexpected.
Small
and
hard.
Pinching
the
tiny
object
between
his
fingers,
Langdon
pulled
it
out
and
stared
in
astonishment.
It
was
a
metallic,
button
shaped
disk,
about
the
size
of
a
watch
battery.
He
had
never
seen
it
before.
"What
the?"
"GPS
tracking
dot,"
Sophie
said.
"Continuously
transmits
its
location
to
a
Global
Positioning
System
satellite
that
DCPJ
can
monitor.
We
use
them
to
monitor
people's
locations.
It's
accurate
within
two
feet
anywhere
on
the
globe.
They
have
you
on
an
electronic
leash.
The
agent
who
picked
you
up
at
the
hotel
slipped
it
inside
your
pocket
before
you
left
your
room."
Langdon
flashed
back
to
the
hotel
room
his
quick
shower,
getting
dressed,
the
DCPJ
agent
politely
holding
out
Langdon'
s
tweed
coat
as
they
left
the
room.
It's
cool
outside,
Mr.
Langdon,
the
agent
had
said.
Spring
in
Paris
is
not
all
your
song
boasts.
Langdon
had
thanked
him
and
donned
the
jacket.
Sophie's
olive
gaze
was
keen.
"I
didn't
tell
you
about
the
tracking
dot
earlier
because
I
didn't
want
you
checking
your
pocket
in
front
of
Fache.
He
can't
know
you've
found
it."
Langdon
had
no
idea
how
to
respond.
"They
tagged
you
with
GPS
because
they
thought
you
might
run."
She
paused.
"In
fact,
they
hoped
you
would
run;
it
would
make
their
case
stronger."
"Why
would
I
run!"
Langdon
demanded.
"I'm
innocent!"
"Fache
feels
otherwise."
Angrily,
Langdon
stalked
toward
the
trash
receptacle
to
dispose
of
the
tracking
dot.
"No!"
Sophie
grabbed
his
arm
and
stopped
him.
"Leave
it
in
your
pocket.
If
you
throw
it
out,
the
signal
will
stop
moving,
and
they'll
know
you
found
the
dot.
The
only
reason
Fache
left
you
alone
is
because
he
can
monitor
where
you
are.
If
he
thinks
you've
discovered
what
he's
doing"
Sophie
did
not
finish
the
thought.
Instead,
she
pried
the
metallic
disk
from
Langdon'
s
hand
and
slid
it
back
into
the
pocket
of
his
tweed
coat.
"The
dot
stays
with
you.
At
least
for
the
moment."
Langdon
felt
lost.
"How
the
hell
could
Fache
actually
believe
I
killed
Jacques
Sauniere!"
"He
has
some
fairly
persuasive
reasons
to
suspect
you."
Sophie's
expression
was
grim.
"There
is
a
piece
of
evidence
here
that
you
have
not
yet
seen.
Fache
has
kept
it
carefully
hidden
from
you."
Langdon
could
only
stare.
"Do
you
recall
the
three
lines
of
text
that
Sauniere
wrote
on
the
floor?"
Langdon
nodded.
The
numbers
and
words
were
imprinted
on
Langdon's
mind.
Sophie's
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
now.
"Unfortunately,
what
you
saw
was
not
the
entire
message.
There
was
a
fourth
line
that
Fache
photographed
and
then
wiped
clean
before
you
arrived.
Although
Langdon
knew
the
soluble
ink
of
a
watermark
stylus
could
easily
be
wiped
away,
he
could
not
imagine
why
Fache
would
erase
evidence.
"The
last
line
of
the
message,"
Sophie
said,
"was
something
Fache
did
not
want
you
to
know
about."
She
paused.
"At
least
not
until
he
was
done
with
you."
Sophie
produced
a
computer
printout
of
a
photo
from
her
sweater
pocket
and
began
unfolding
it.
"Fache
uploaded
images
of
the
crime
scene
to
the
Cryptology
Department
earlier
tonight
in
hopes
we
could
figure
out
what
Sauniere's
message
was
trying
to
say.
This
is
a
photo
of
the
complete
message."
She
handed
the
page
to
Langdon.
Bewildered,
Langdon
looked
at
the
image.
The
close
up
photo
revealed
the
glowing
message
on
the
parquet
floor.
The
final
line
hit
Langdon
like
a
kick
in
the
gut.

O,

P.S.

For
several
seconds,
Langdon
stared
in
wonder
at
the
photograph
of
Sauniere's
postscript.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
He
felt
as
if
the
floor
were
tilting
beneath
his
feet.
Sauniere
left
a
postscript
with
my
name
on
it?
In
his
wildest
dreams,
Langdon
could
not
fathom
why.
"Now
do
you
understand,"
Sophie
said,
her
eyes
urgent,
"why
Fache
ordered
you
here
tonight,
and
why
you
are
his
primary
suspect?"
The
only
thing
Langdon
understood
at
the
moment
was
why
Fache
had
looked
so
smug
when
Langdon
suggested
Sauniere
would
have
accused
his
killer
by
name.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
"Why
would
Sauniere
write
this?"
Langdon
demanded,
his
confusion
now
giving
way
to
anger.
"Why
would
I
want
to
kill
Jacques
Sauniere?"
"Fache
has
yet
to
uncover
a
motive,
but
he
has
been
recording
his
entire
conversation
with
you
tonight
in
hopes
you
might
reveal
one."
Langdon
opened
his
mouth,
but
still
no
words
came.
"He's
fitted
with
a
miniature
microphone,"
Sophie
explained.
"It's
connected
to
a
transmitter
in
his
pocket
that
radios
the
signal
back
to
the
command
post."
"This
is
impossible,"
Langdon
stammered.
"I
have
an
alibi.
I
went
directly
back
to
my
hotel
after
my
lecture.
You
can
ask
the
hotel
desk."
"Fache
already
did.
His
report
shows
you
retrieving
your
room
key
from
the
concierge
at
about
ten
thirty.
Unfortunately,
the
time
of
the
murder
was
closer
to
eleven.
You
easily
could
have
left
your
hotel
room
unseen."
"This
is
insanity!
Fache
has
no
evidence!"
Sophie's
eyes
widened
as
if
to
say:
No
evidence?
"Mr.
Langdon,
your
name
is
written
on
the
floor
beside
the
body,
and
Sauniere's
date
book
says
you
were
with
him
at
approximately
the
time
of
the
murder."
She
paused.
"Fache
has
more
than
enough
evidence
to
take
you
into
custody
for
questioning."
Langdon
suddenly
sensed
that
he
needed
a
lawyer.
"I
didn't
do
this."
Sophie
sighed.
"This
is
not
American
television,
Mr.
Langdon.
In
France,
the
laws
protect
the
police,
not
criminals.
Unfortunately,
in
this
case,
there
is
also
the
media
consideration.
Jacques
Sauniere
was
a
very
prominent
and
well
loved
figure
in
Paris,
and
his
murder
will
be
news
in
the
morning.
Fache
will
be
under
immediate
pressure
to
make
a
statement,
and
he
looks
a
lot
better
having
a
suspect
in
custody
already.
Whether
or
not
you
are
guilty,
you
most
certainly
will
be
held
by
DCPJ
until
they
can
figure
out
what
really
happened."
Langdon
felt
like
a
caged
animal.
"Why
are
you
telling
me
all
this?"
"Because,
Mr.
Langdon,
I
believe
you
are
innocent."
Sophie
looked
away
for
a
moment
and
then
back
into
his
eyes.
"And
also
because
it
is
partially
my
fault
that
you're
in
trouble."
"I'm
sorry?
It's
your
fault
Sauniere
is
trying
to
frame
me?"
"Sauniere
wasn't
trying
to
frame
you.
It
was
a
mistake.
That
message
on
the
floor
was
meant
for
me."
Langdon
needed
a
minute
to
process
that
one.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"That
message
wasn't
for
the
police.
He
wrote
it
for
me.
I
think
he
was
forced
to
do
everything
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
just
didn't
realize
how
it
would
look
to
the
police."
She
paused.
"The
numbered
code
is
meaningless.
Sauniere
wrote
it
to
make
sure
the
investigation
included
cryptographers,
ensuring
that
would
know
as
soon
as
possible
what
had
happened
to
him."
Langdon
felt
himself
losing
touch
fast.
Whether
or
not
Sophie
Neveu
had
lost
her
mind
was
at
this
point
up
for
grabs,
but
at
least
Langdon
now
understood
why
she
was
trying
to
help
him.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
She
apparently
believed
the
curator
had
left
her
a
cryptic
postscript
telling
her
to
find
Langdon.
"But
why
do
you
think
his
message
was
for
you?"
"The
Vitruvian
Man,
"
she
said
flatly.
"That
particular
sketch
has
always
been
my
favorite
Da
Vinci
work.
Tonight
he
used
it
to
catch
my
attention."
"Hold
on.
You're
saying
the
curator
knew
your
favorite
piece
of
art?"
She
nodded.
"I'm
sorry.
This
is
all
coming
out
of
order.
Jacques
Sauniere
and
I"
Sophie's
voice
caught,
and
Langdon
heard
a
sudden
melancholy
there,
a
painful
past,
simmering
just
below
the
surface.
Sophie
and
Jacques
Sauniere
apparently
had
some
kind
of
special
relationship.
Langdon
studied
the
beautiful
young
woman
before
him,
well
aware
that
aging
men
in
France
often
took
young
mistresses.
Even
so,
Sophie
Neveu
as
a
"kept
woman"
somehow
didn't
seem
to
fit.
"We
had
a
falling
out
ten
years
ago,"
Sophie
said,
her
voice
a
whisper
now.
"We've
barely
spoken
since.
Tonight,
when
Crypto
got
the
call
that
he
had
been
murdered,
and
I
saw
the
images
of
his
body
and
text
on
the
floor,
I
realized
he
was
trying
to
send
me
a
message."
"Because
of
The
Vitruvian
Man?"
"Yes.
And
the
letters
P.S."
"PostScript?"
She
shook
her
head.
"P.S.
are
my
initials."
"But
your
name
is
Sophie
Neveu."
She
looked
away.
"P.S.
is
the
nickname
he
called
me
when
I
lived
with
him."
She
blushed.
"It
stood
for
Princesse
Sophie
Langdon
had
no
response.
"Silly,
I
know,"
she
said.
"But
it
was
years
ago.
When
I
was
a
little
girl."
"You
knew
him
when
you
were
a
little
girl?"
"Quite
well,"
she
said,
her
eyes
welling
now
with
emotion.
"Jacques
Sauniere
was
my
grandfather."
"Where's
Langdon?"
Fache
demanded,
exhaling
the
last
of
a
cigarette
as
he
paced
back
into
the
command
post.
"Still
in
the
men's
room,
sir."
Lieutenant
Collet
had
been
expecting
the
question.
Fache
grumbled,
"Taking
his
time,
I
see."
The
captain
eyed
the
GPS
dot
over
Collet's
shoulder,
and
Collet
could
almost
hear
the
wheels
turning.
Fache
was
fighting
the
urge
to
go
check
on
Langdon.
Ideally,
the
subject
of
an
observation
was
allowed
the
most
time
and
freedom
possible,
lulling
him
into
a
false
sense
of
security.
Langdon
needed
to
return
of
his
own
volition.
Still,
it
had
been
almost
ten
minutes.
Too
long.
"Any
chance
Langdon
is
onto
us?"
Fache
asked.
Collet
shook
his
head.
"We're
still
seeing
small
movements
inside
the
men's
room,
so
the
GPS
dot
is
obviously
still
on
him.
Perhaps
he
feels
ill?
If
he
had
found
the
dot,
he
would
have
removed
it
and
tried
to
run.
Fache
checked
his
watch.
"Fine."
Still
Fache
seemed
preoccupied.
All
evening,
Collet
had
sensed
an
atypical
intensity
in
his
captain.
Usually
detached
and
cool
under
pressure,
Fache
tonight
seemed
emotionally
engaged,
as
if
this
were
somehow
a
personal
matter
for
him.
Not
surprising,
Collet
thought.
Fache
needs
this
arrest
desperately.
Recently
the
Board
of
Ministers
and
the
media
had
become
more
openly
critical
of
Fache's
aggressive
tactics,
his
clashes
with
powerful
foreign
embassies,
and
his
gross
overbudgeting
on
new
technologies.
Tonight,
a
high
tech,
high
profile
arrest
of
an
American
would
go
a
long
way
to
silence
Fache's
critics,
helping
him
secure
the
job
a
few
more
years
until
he
could
retire
with
the
lucrative
pension.
God
knows
he
needs
the
pension,
Collet
thought.
Fache's
zeal
for
technology
had
hurt
him
both
professionally
and
personally.
Fache
was
rumored
to
have
invested
his
entire
savings
in
the
technology
craze
a
few
years
back
and
lost
his
shirt.
And
Fache
is
a
man
who
wears
only
the
finest
shirts.
Tonight,
there
was
still
plenty
of
time.
Sophie
Neveu's
odd
interruption,
though
unfortunate,
had
been
only
a
minor
wrinkle.
She
was
gone
now,
and
Fache
still
had
cards
to
play.
He
had
yet
to
inform
Langdon
that
his
name
had
been
scrawled
on
the
floor
by
the
victim.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
The
American's
reaction
to
that
little
bit
of
evidence
would
be
telling
indeed.
"Captain?"
one
of
the
DCPJ
agents
now
called
from
across
the
office.
"I
think
you
better
take
this
call."
He
was
holding
out
a
telephone
receiver,
looking
concerned.
"Who
is
it?"
Fache
said.
The
agent
frowned.
"It's
the
director
of
our
Cryptology
Department."
"And?"
"It's
about
Sophie
Neveu,
sir.
Something
is
not
quite
right."
It
was
time.
Silas
felt
strong
as
he
stepped
from
the
black
Audi,
the
nighttime
breeze
rustling
his
loose
fitting
robe.
The
winds
of
change
are
in
the
air.
He
knew
the
task
before
him
would
require
more
finesse
than
force,
and
he
left
his
handgun
in
the
car.
The
thirteen
round
Heckler
Koch
USP
40
had
been
provided
by
the
Teacher.
A
weapon
of
death
has
no
place
in
a
house
of
God.
The
plaza
before
the
great
church
was
deserted
at
this
hour,
the
only
visible
souls
on
the
far
side
of
Place
Saint
Sulpice
a
couple
of
teenage
hookers
showing
their
wares
to
the
late
night
tourist
traffic.
Their
nubile
bodies
sent
a
familiar
longing
to
Silas's
loins.
His
thigh
flexed
instinctively,
causing
the
barbed
cilice
belt
to
cut
painfully
into
his
flesh.
The
lust
evaporated
instantly.
For
ten
years
now,
Silas
had
faithfully
denied
himself
all
sexual
indulgence,
even
self
administered.
It
was
The
Way.
He
knew
he
had
sacrificed
much
to
follow
Opus
Dei,
but
he
had
received
much
more
in
return.
A
vow
of
celibacy
and
the
relinquishment
of
all
personal
assets
hardly
seemed
a
sacrifice.
Considering
the
poverty
from
which
he
had
come
and
the
sexual
horrors
he
had
endured
in
prison,
celibacy
was
a
welcome
change.
Now,
having
returned
to
France
for
the
first
time
since
being
arrested
and
shipped
to
prison
in
Andorra,
Silas
could
feel
his
homeland
testing
him,
dragging
violent
memories
from
his
redeemed
soul.
You
have
been
reborn,
he
reminded
himself.
His
service
to
God
today
had
required
the
sin
of
murder,
and
it
was
a
sacrifice
Silas
knew
he
would
have
to
hold
silently
in
his
heart
for
all
eternity.
The
measure
of
your
faith
is
the
measure
of
the
pain
you
can
endure,
the
Teacher
had
told
him.
Silas
was
no
stranger
to
pain
and
felt
eager
to
prove
himself
to
the
Teacher,
the
one
who
had
assured
him
his
actions
were
ordained
by
a
higher
power.
"Hago
la
obra
de
Dios,
"
Silas
whispered,
moving
now
toward
the
church
entrance.
Pausing
in
the
shadow
of
the
massive
doorway,
he
took
a
deep
breath.
It
was
not
until
this
instant
that
he
truly
realized
what
he
was
about
to
do,
and
what
awaited
him
inside.
The
keystone.
It
will
lead
us
to
our
final
goal.
He
raised
his
ghost
white
fist
and
banged
three
times
on
the
door.
Moments
later,
the
bolts
of
the
enormous
wooden
portal
began
to
move.
Sophie
wondered
how
long
it
would
take
Fache
to
figure
out
she
had
not
left
the
building.
Seeing
that
Langdon
was
clearly
overwhelmed,
Sophie
questioned
whether
she
had
done
the
right
thing
by
cornering
him
here
in
the
men's
room.
What
else
was
I
supposed
to
do
?
She
pictured
her
grandfather's
body,
naked
and
spread
eagle
on
the
floor.
There
was
a
time
when
he
had
meant
the
world
to
her,
yet
tonight,
Sophie
was
surprised
to
feel
almost
no
sadness
for
the
man.
Jacques
Sauniere
was
a
stranger
to
her
now.
Their
relationship
had
evaporated
in
a
single
instant
one
March
night
when
she
was
twenty
two.
Ten
years
ago.
Sophie
had
come
home
a
few
days
early
from
graduate
university
in
England
and
mistakenly
witnessed
her
grandfather
engaged
in
something
Sophie
was
obviously
not
supposed
to
see.
It
was
an
image
she
barely
could
believe
to
this
day.
If
I
hadn't
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
Too
ashamed
and
stunned
to
endure
her
grandfather's
pained
attempts
to
explain,
Sophie
immediately
moved
out
on
her
own,
taking
money
she
had
saved,
and
getting
a
small
flat
with
some
roommates.
She
vowed
never
to
speak
to
anyone
about
what
she
had
seen.
Her
grandfather
tried
desperately
to
reach
her,
sending
cards
and
letters,
begging
Sophie
to
meet
him
so
he
could
explain.
Explain
how!
?
Sophie
never
responded
except
once
to
forbid
him
ever
to
call
her
or
try
to
meet
her
in
public.
She
was
afraid
his
explanation
would
be
more
terrifying
than
the
incident
itself.
Incredibly,
Sauniere
had
never
given
up
on
her,
and
Sophie
now
possessed
a
decade's
worth
of
correspondence
unopened
in
a
dresser
drawer.
To
her
grandfather's
credit,
he
had
never
once
disobeyed
her
request
and
phoned
her.
Until
this
afternoon.
"Sophie?"
His
voice
had
sounded
startlingly
old
on
her
answering
machine.
"I
have
abided
by
your
wishes
for
so
long
and
it
pains
me
to
call,
but
I
must
speak
to
you.
Something
terrible
has
happened."
Standing
in
the
kitchen
of
her
Paris
flat,
Sophie
felt
a
chill
to
hear
him
again
after
all
these
years.
His
gentle
voice
brought
back
a
flood
of
fond
childhood
memories.
"Sophie,
please
listen."
He
was
speaking
English
to
her,
as
he
always
did
when
she
was
a
little
girl.
Practice
French
at
school.
Practice
English
at
home.
"You
cannot
be
mad
forever.
Have
you
not
read
the
letters
that
I've
sent
all
these
years?
Do
you
not
yet
understand?"
He
paused.
"We
must
speak
at
once.
Please
grant
your
grandfather
this
one
wish.
Call
me
at
the
Louvre.
Right
away.
I
believe
you
and
I
are
in
grave
danger."
Sophie
stared
at
the
answering
machine.
Danger?
What
was
he
talking
about?
"Princess"
Her
grandfather's
voice
cracked
with
an
emotion
Sophie
could
not
place.
"I
know
I've
kept
things
from
you,
and
I
know
it
has
cost
me
your
love.
But
it
was
for
your
own
safety.
Now
you
must
know
the
truth.
Please,
I
must
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
family."
Sophie
suddenly
could
hear
her
own
heart.
My
family?
Sophie's
parents
had
died
when
she
was
only
four.
Their
car
went
off
a
bridge
into
fast
moving
water.
Her
grandmother
and
younger
brother
had
also
been
in
the
car,
and
Sophie's
entire
family
had
been
erased
in
an
instant.
She
had
a
box
of
newspaper
clippings
to
confirm
it.
His
words
had
sent
an
unexpected
surge
of
longing
through
her
bones.
My
family!
In
that
fleeting
instant,
Sophie
saw
images
from
the
dream
that
had
awoken
her
countless
times
when
she
was
a
little
girl:
My
family
is
alive!
They
are
coming
home!
But,
as
in
her
dream,
the
pictures
evaporated
into
oblivion.
Your
family
is
dead,
Sophie.
They
are
not
coming
home.
"Sophie"
her
grandfather
said
on
the
machine.
"I
have
been
waiting
for
years
to
tell
you.
Waiting
for
the
right
moment,
but
now
time
has
run
out.
Call
me
at
the
Louvre.
As
soon
as
you
get
this.
I'll
wait
here
all
night.
I
fear
we
both
may
be
in
danger.
There's
so
much
you
need
to
know."
The
message
ended.
In
the
silence,
Sophie
stood
trembling
for
what
felt
like
minutes.
As
she
considered
her
grandfather's
message,
only
one
possibility
made
sense,
and
his
true
intent
dawned.
It
was
bait.
Obviously,
her
grandfather
wanted
desperately
to
see
her.
He
was
trying
anything.
Her
disgust
for
the
man
deepened.
Sophie
wondered
if
maybe
he
had
fallen
terminally
ill
and
had
decided
to
attempt
any
ploy
he
could
think
of
to
get
Sophie
to
visit
him
one
last
time.
If
so,
he
had
chosen
wisely.
My
family.
Now,
standing
in
the
darkness
of
the
Louvre
men's
room,
Sophie
could
hear
the
echoes
of
this
afternoon's
phone
message.
Sophie,
we
both
may
be
in
danger.
Call
me.
She
had
not
called
him.
Nor
had
she
planned
to.
Now,
however,
her
skepticism
had
been
deeply
challenged.
Her
grandfather
lay
murdered
inside
his
own
museum.
And
he
had
written
a
code
on
the
floor.
A
code
for
her.
Of
this,
she
was
certain.
Despite
not
understanding
the
meaning
of
his
message,
Sophie
was
certain
its
cryptic
nature
was
additional
proof
that
the
words
were
intended
for
her.
Sophie's
passion
and
aptitude
for
cryptography
were
a
product
of
growing
up
with
Jacques
Sauniere
a
fanatic
himself
for
codes,
word
games,
and
puzzles.
How
many
Sundays
did
we
spend
doing
the
cryptograms
and
crosswords
in
the
newspaper?
At
the
age
of
twelve,
Sophie
could
finish
the
he
Monde
crossword
without
any
help,
and
her
grandfather
graduated
her
to
crosswords
in
English,
mathematical
puzzles,
and
substitution
ciphers.
Sophie
devoured
them
all.
Eventually
she
turned
her
passion
into
a
profession
by
becoming
a
codebreaker
for
the
Judicial
Police.
Tonight,
the
cryptographer
in
Sophie
was
forced
to
respect
the
efficiency
with
which
her
grandfather
had
used
a
simple
code
to
unite
two
total
strangers
Sophie
Neveu
and
Robert
Langdon.
The
question
was
why?
Unfortunately,
from
the
bewildered
look
in
Langdon's
eyes,
Sophie
sensed
the
American
had
no
more
idea
than
she
did
why
her
grandfather
had
thrown
them
together.
She
pressed
again.
"You
and
my
grandfather
had
planned
to
meet
tonight.
What
about?"
Langdon
looked
truly
perplexed.
"His
secretary
set
the
meeting
and
didn't
offer
any
specific
reason,
and
I
didn't
ask.
I
assumed
he'd
heard
I
would
be
lecturing
on
the
pagan
iconography
of
French
cathedrals,
was
interested
in
the
topic,
and
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
meet
for
drinks
after
the
talk."
Sophie
didn't
buy
it.
The
connection
was
flimsy.
Her
grandfather
knew
more
about
pagan
iconography
than
anyone
else
on
earth.
Moreover,
he
an
exceptionally
private
man,
not
someone
prone
to
chatting
with
random
American
professors
unless
there
were
an
important
reason.
Sophie
took
a
deep
breath
and
probed
further.
"My
grandfather
called
me
this
afternoon
and
told
me
he
and
I
were
in
grave
danger.
Does
that
mean
anything
to
you?"
Langdon's
blue
eyes
now
clouded
with
concern.
"No,
but
considering
what
just
happened"
Sophie
nodded.
Considering
tonight's
events,
she
would
be
a
fool
not
to
be
frightened.
Feeling
drained,
she
walked
to
the
small
plate
glass
window
at
the
far
end
of
the
bathroom
and
gazed
out
in
silence
through
the
mesh
of
alarm
tape
embedded
in
the
glass.
They
were
high
up
forty
feet
at
least.
Sighing,
she
raised
her
eyes
and
gazed
out
at
Paris's
dazzling
landscape.
On
her
left,
across
the
Seine,
the
illuminated
Eiffel
Tower.
Straight
ahead,
the
Arc
de
Triomphe.
And
to
the
right,
high
atop
the
sloping
rise
of
Montmartre,
the
graceful
arabesque
dome
of
Sacre
Coeur,
its
polished
stone
glowing
white
like
a
resplendent
sanctuary.
Here
at
the
westernmost
tip
of
the
Denon
Wing,
the
north
south
thoroughfare
of
Place
du
Carrousel
ran
almost
flush
with
the
building
with
only
a
narrow
sidewalk
separating
it
from
the
Louvre's
outer
wall.
Far
below,
the
usual
caravan
of
the
city's
nighttime
delivery
trucks
sat
idling,
waiting
for
the
signals
to
change,
their
running
lights
seeming
to
twinkle
mockingly
up
at
Sophie.
"I
don't
know
what
to
say,"
Langdon
said,
coming
up
behind
her.
"Your
grandfather
is
obviously
trying
to
tell
us
something.
I'm
sorry
I'm
so
little
help."
Sophie
turned
from
the
window,
sensing
a
sincere
regret
in
Langdon's
deep
voice.
Even
with
all
the
trouble
around
him,
he
obviously
wanted
to
help
her.
The
teacher
in
him,
she
thought,
having
read
DCPJ's
workup
on
their
suspect.
This
was
an
academic
who
clearly
despised
not
understanding.
We
have
that
in
common,
she
thought.
As
a
codebreaker,
Sophie
made
her
living
extracting
meaning
from
seemingly
senseless
data.
Tonight,
her
best
guess
was
that
Robert
Langdon,
whether
he
knew
it
or
not,
possessed
information
that
she
desperately
needed.
Princesse
Sophie,
Find
Robert
Langdon.
How
much
clearer
could
her
grandfather's
message
be?
Sophie
needed
more
time
with
Langdon.
Time
to
think.
Time
to
sort
out
this
mystery
together.
Unfortunately,
time
was
running
out.
Gazing
up
at
Langdon,
Sophie
made
the
only
play
she
could
think
of.
"Bezu
Fache
will
be
taking
you
into
custody
at
any
minute.
I
can
get
you
out
of
this
museum.
But
we
need
to
act
now."
Langdon's
eyes
went
wide.
"You
want
me
to
run?"
"It's
the
smartest
thing
you
could
do.
If
you
let
Fache
take
you
into
custody
now,
you'll
spend
weeks
in
a
French
jail
while
DCPJ
and
the
U.S.
Embassy
fight
over
which
courts
try
your
case.
But
if
we
get
you
out
of
here,
and
make
it
to
your
embassy,
then
your
government
will
protect
your
rights
while
you
and
I
prove
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
murder.
Langdon
looked
not
even
vaguely
convinced.
"Forget
it!
Fache
has
armed
guards
on
every
single
exit!
Even
if
we
escape
without
being
shot,
running
away
only
makes
me
look
guilty.
You
need
to
tell
Fache
that
the
message
on
the
floor
was
for
you,
and
that
my
name
is
not
there
as
an
accusation.
"I
will
do
that,"
Sophie
said,
speaking
hurriedly,
"but
after
you're
safely
inside
the
U.S.
Embassy.
It's
only
about
a
mile
from
here,
and
my
car
is
parked
just
outside
the
museum.
Dealing
with
Fache
from
here
is
too
much
of
a
gamble.
Don't
you
see?
Fache
has
made
it
his
mission
tonight
to
prove
you
are
guilty.
The
only
reason
he
postponed
your
arrest
was
to
run
this
observance
in
hopes
you
did
something
that
made
his
case
stronger."
"Exactly.
Like
running!"
The
cell
phone
in
Sophie's
sweater
pocket
suddenly
began
ringing.
Fache
probably.
She
reached
in
her
sweater
and
turned
off
the
phone.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
she
said
hurriedly,
"I
need
to
ask
you
one
last
question."
And
your
entire
future
may
depend
on
it.
"The
writing
on
the
floor
is
obviously
not
proof
of
your
guilt,
and
yet
Fache
told
our
team
he
is
certain
you
are
his
man.
Can
you
think
of
any
other
reason
he
might
be
convinced
you're
guilty?"
Langdon
was
silent
for
several
seconds.
"None
whatsoever."
Sophie
sighed.
Which
means
Fache
is
lying.
Why,
Sophie
could
not
begin
to
imagine,
but
that
was
hardly
the
issue
at
this
point.
The
fact
remained
that
Bezu
Fache
was
determined
to
put
Robert
Langdon
behind
bars
tonight,
at
any
cost.
Sophie
needed
Langdon
for
herself,
and
it
was
this
dilemma
that
left
Sophie
only
one
logical
conclusion.
need
to
get
Langdon
to
the
U.S.
Embassy.
Turning
toward
the
window,
Sophie
gazed
through
the
alarm
mesh
embedded
in
the
plate
glass,
down
the
dizzying
forty
feet
to
the
pavement
below.
A
leap
from
this
height
would
leave
Langdon
with
a
couple
of
broken
legs.
At
best.
Nonetheless,
Sophie
made
her
decision.
Robert
Langdon
was
about
to
escape
the
Louvre,
whether
he
wanted
to
or
not.
"What
do
you
mean
she's
not
answering?"
Fache
looked
incredulous.
"You're
calling
her
cell
phone,
right?
I
know
she's
carrying
it."
Collet
had
been
trying
to
reach
Sophie
now
for
several
minutes.
"Maybe
her
batteries
are
dead.
Or
her
ringer's
off."
Fache
had
looked
distressed
ever
since
talking
to
the
director
of
Cryptology
on
the
phone.
After
hanging
up,
he
had
marched
over
to
Collet
and
demanded
he
get
Agent
Neveu
on
the
line.
Now
Collet
had
failed,
and
Fache
was
pacing
like
a
caged
lion.
"Why
did
Crypto
call?"
Collet
now
ventured.
Fache
turned.
"To
tell
us
they
found
no
references
to
Draconian
devils
and
lame
saints."
"That's
all?"
"No,
also
to
tell
us
that
they
had
just
identified
the
numerics
as
Fibonacci
numbers,
but
they
suspected
the
series
was
meaningless."
Collet
was
confused.
"But
they
already
sent
Agent
Neveu
to
tell
us
that."
Fache
shook
his
head.
"They
didn't
send
Neveu."
"What?"
"According
to
the
director,
at
my
orders
he
paged
his
entire
team
to
look
at
the
images
I'd
wired
him.
When
Agent
Neveu
arrived,
she
took
one
look
at
the
photos
of
Sauniere
and
the
code
and
left
the
office
without
a
word.
The
director
said
he
didn't
question
her
behavior
because
she
was
understandably
upset
by
the
photos."
"Upset?
She's
never
seen
a
picture
of
a
dead
body?"
Fache
was
silent
a
moment.
"I
was
not
aware
of
this,
and
it
seems
neither
was
the
director
until
a
coworker
informed
him,
but
apparently
Sophie
Neveu
is
Jacques
Sauniere's
granddaughter."
Collet
was
speechless.
"The
director
said
she
never
once
mentioned
Sauniere
to
him,
and
he
assumed
it
was
because
she
probably
didn't
want
preferential
treatment
for
having
a
famous
grandfather."
No
wonder
she
was
upset
by
the
pictures.
Collet
could
barely
conceive
of
the
unfortunate
coincidence
that
called
in
a
young
woman
to
decipher
a
code
written
by
a
dead
family
member.
Still,
her
actions
made
no
sense.
"But
she
obviously
recognized
the
numbers
as
Fibonacci
numbers
because
she
came
here
and
told
us.
I
don't
understand
why
she
would
leave
the
office
without
telling
anyone
she
had
figured
it
out."
Collet
could
think
of
only
one
scenario
to
explain
the
troubling
developments:
Sauniere
had
written
a
numeric
code
on
the
floor
in
hopes
Fache
would
involve
cryptographers
in
the
investigation,
and
therefore
involve
his
own
granddaughter.
As
for
the
rest
of
the
message,
was
Sauniere
communicating
in
some
way
with
his
granddaughter?
If
so,
what
did
the
message
tell
her?
And
how
did
Langdon
fit
in?
Before
Collet
could
ponder
it
any
further,
the
silence
of
the
deserted
museum
was
shattered
by
an
alarm.
The
bell
sounded
like
it
was
coming
from
inside
the
Grand
Gallery.
"Alarme!
"
one
of
the
agents
yelled,
eyeing
his
feed
from
the
Louvre
security
center.
"Grande
Galerie!
Toilettes
Messieurs!
Fache
wheeled
to
Collet.
"Where's
Langdon?"
"Still
in
the
men's
room!"
Collet
pointed
to
the
blinking
red
dot
on
his
laptop
schematic.
"He
must
have
broken
the
window
!
"
Collet
knew
Langdon
wouldn't
get
far.
Although
Paris
fire
codes
required
windows
above
fifteen
meters
in
public
buildings
be
breakable
in
case
of
fire,
exiting
a
Louvre
second
story
window
without
the
help
of
a
hook
and
ladder
would
be
suicide.
Furthermore,
there
were
no
trees
or
grass
on
the
western
end
of
the
Denon
Wing
to
cushion
a
fall.
Directly
beneath
that
rest
room
window,
the
two
lane
Place
du
Carrousel
ran
within
a
few
feet
of
the
outer
wall.
"My
God,"
Collet
exclaimed,
eyeing
the
screen.
"Langdon's
moving
to
the
window
ledge!"
But
Fache
was
already
in
motion.
Yanking
his
Manurhin
MR
93
revolver
from
his
shoulder
holster,
the
captain
dashed
out
of
the
office.
Collet
watched
the
screen
in
bewilderment
as
the
blinking
dot
arrived
at
the
window
ledge
and
then
did
something
utterly
unexpected.
The
dot
moved
outside
the
perimeter
of
the
building.
What's
going
on?
he
wondered.
Is
Langdon
out
on
a
ledge
or
"Jesuf"
Collet
jumped
to
his
feet
as
the
dot
shot
farther
outside
the
wall.
The
signal
seemed
to
shudder
for
a
moment,
and
then
the
blinking
dot
came
to
an
abrupt
stop
about
ten
yards
outside
the
perimeter
of
the
building.
Fumbling
with
the
controls,
Collet
called
up
a
Paris
street
map
and
recalibrated
the
GPS.
Zooming
in,
he
could
now
see
the
exact
location
of
the
signal.
It
was
no
longer
moving.
It
lay
at
a
dead
stop
in
the
middle
of
Place
du
Carrousel.
Langdon
had
jumped.
Fache
sprinted
down
the
Grand
Gallery
as
Collet's
radio
blared
over
the
distant
sound
of
the
alarm.
"He
jumped!"
Collet
was
yelling.
"I'm
showing
the
signal
out
on
Place
du
Carrousel!
Outside
the
bathroom
window!
And
it's
not
moving
at
all!
Jesus,
I
think
Langdon
has
just
committed
suicide!"
Fache
heard
the
words,
but
they
made
no
sense.
He
kept
running.
The
hallway
seemed
never
ending.
As
he
sprinted
past
Sauniere's
body,
he
set
his
sights
on
the
partitions
at
the
far
end
of
the
Denon
Wing.
The
alarm
was
getting
louder
now.
"Wait!"
Collet's
voice
blared
again
over
the
radio.
"He's
moving!
My
God,
he's
alive.
Langdon's
moving
!
Fache
kept
running,
cursing
the
length
of
the
hallway
with
every
step.
"Langdon's
moving
faster!"
Collet
was
still
yelling
on
the
radio.
"He's
running
down
Carrousel.
Wait
he's
picking
up
speed.
He's
moving
too
fast!"
Arriving
at
the
partitions,
Fache
snaked
his
way
through
them,
saw
the
rest
room
door,
and
ran
for
it.
The
walkie
talkie
was
barely
audible
now
over
the
alarm.
"He
must
be
in
a
car!
I
think
he's
in
a
car!
I
can't
Collet's
words
were
swallowed
by
the
alarm
as
Fache
finally
burst
into
the
men's
room
with
his
gun
drawn.
Wincing
against
the
piercing
shrill,
he
scanned
the
area.
The
stalls
were
empty.
The
bathroom
deserted.
Fache's
eyes
moved
immediately
to
the
shattered
window
at
the
far
end
of
the
room.
He
ran
to
the
opening
and
looked
over
the
edge.
Langdon
was
nowhere
to
be
seen.
Fache
could
not
imagine
anyone
risking
a
stunt
like
this.
Certainly
if
he
had
dropped
that
far,
he
would
be
badly
injured.
The
alarm
cut
off
finally,
and
Collet's
voice
became
audible
again
over
the
walkie
talkie.
"moving
south
faster
crossing
the
Seine
on
Pont
du
Carrousel!"
Fache
turned
to
his
left.
The
only
vehicle
on
Pont
du
Carrousel
was
an
enormous
twin
bed
Trailor
delivery
truck
moving
southward
away
from
the
Louvre.
The
truck's
open
air
bed
was
covered
with
a
vinyl
tarp,
roughly
resembling
a
giant
hammock.
Fache
felt
a
shiver
of
apprehension.
That
truck,
only
moments
ago,
had
probably
been
stopped
at
a
red
light
directly
beneath
the
rest
room
window.
An
insane
risk,
Fache
told
himself.
Langdon
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
truck
was
carrying
beneath
that
tarp.
What
if
the
truck
were
carrying
steel?
Or
cement?
Or
even
garbage?
A
forty
foot
leap?
It
was
madness.
"The
dot
is
turning!"
Collet
called.
"He's
turning
right
on
Pont
des
Saints
Peres!"
Sure
enough,
the
Trailor
truck
that
had
crossed
the
bridge
was
slowing
down
and
making
a
right
turn
onto
Pont
des
Saints
Peres.
So
be
it,
Fache
thought.
Amazed,
he
watched
the
truck
disappear
around
the
corner.
Collet
was
already
radioing
the
agents
outside,
pulling
them
off
the
Louvre
perimeter
and
sending
them
to
their
patrol
cars
in
pursuit,
all
the
while
broadcasting
the
truck's
changing
location
like
some
kind
of
bizarre
play
by
play.
It's
over,
Fache
knew.
His
men
would
have
the
truck
surrounded
within
minutes.
Langdon
was
not
going
anywhere.
Stowing
his
weapon,
Fache
exited
the
rest
room
and
radioed
Collet.
"Bring
my
car
around.
I
want
to
be
there
when
we
make
the
arrest."
As
Fache
jogged
back
down
the
length
of
the
Grand
Gallery,
he
wondered
if
Langdon
had
even
survived
the
fall.
Not
that
it
mattered.
Langdon
ran.
Guilty
as
charged.
Only
fifteen
yards
from
the
rest
room,
Langdon
and
Sophie
stood
in
the
darkness
of
the
Grand
Gallery,
their
backs
pressed
to
one
of
the
large
partitions
that
hid
the
bathrooms
from
the
gallery.
They
had
barely
managed
to
hide
themselves
before
Fache
had
darted
past
them,
gun
drawn,
and
disappeared
into
the
bathroom.
The
last
sixty
seconds
had
been
a
blur.
Langdon
had
been
standing
inside
the
men's
room
refusing
to
run
from
a
crime
he
didn't
commit,
when
Sophie
began
eyeing
the
plate
glass
window
and
examining
the
alarm
mesh
running
through
it.
Then
she
peered
downward
into
the
street,
as
if
measuring
the
drop.
"With
a
little
aim,
you
can
get
out
of
here,"
she
said.
Aim?
Uneasy,
he
peered
out
the
rest
room
window.
Up
the
street,
an
enormous
twin
bed
eighteenwheeler
was
headed
for
the
stoplight
beneath
the
window.
Stretched
across
the
truck's
massive
cargo
bay
was
a
blue
vinyl
tarp,
loosely
covering
the
truck's
load.
Langdon
hoped
Sophie
was
not
thinking
what
she
seemed
to
be
thinking.
"Sophie,
there's
no
way
I'm
jump
"Take
out
the
tracking
dot."
Bewildered,
Langdon
fumbled
in
his
pocket
until
he
found
the
tiny
metallic
disk.
Sophie
took
it
from
him
and
strode
immediately
to
the
sink.
She
grabbed
a
thick
bar
of
soap,
placed
the
tracking
dot
on
top
of
it,
and
used
her
thumb
to
push
the
disk
down
hard
into
the
bar.
As
the
disk
sank
into
the
soft
surface,
she
pinched
the
hole
closed,
firmly
embedding
the
device
in
the
bar.
Handing
the
bar
to
Langdon,
Sophie
retrieved
a
heavy,
cylindrical
trash
can
from
under
the
sinks.
Before
Langdon
could
protest,
Sophie
ran
at
the
window,
holding
the
can
before
her
like
a
battering
ram.
Driving
the
bottom
of
the
trash
can
into
the
center
of
the
window,
she
shattered
the
glass.
Alarms
erupted
overhead
at
earsplitting
decibel
levels.
"Give
me
the
soap!"
Sophie
yelled,
barely
audible
over
the
alarm.
Langdon
thrust
the
bar
into
her
hand.
Palming
the
soap,
she
peered
out
the
shattered
window
at
the
eighteen
wheeler
idling
below.
The
target
was
plenty
big
an
expansive,
stationary
tarp
and
it
was
less
than
ten
feet
from
the
side
of
the
building.
As
the
traffic
lights
prepared
to
change,
Sophie
took
a
deep
breath
and
lobbed
the
bar
of
soap
out
into
the
night.
The
soap
plummeted
downward
toward
the
truck,
landing
on
the
edge
of
the
tarp,
and
sliding
downward
into
the
cargo
bay
just
as
the
traffic
light
turned
green.
"Congratulations,"
Sophie
said,
dragging
him
toward
the
door.
"You
just
escaped
from
the
Louvre."
Fleeing
the
men's
room,
they
moved
into
the
shadows
just
as
Fache
rushed
past.
Now,
with
the
fire
alarm
silenced,
Langdon
could
hear
the
sounds
of
DCPJ
sirens
tearing
away
from
the
Louvre.
A
police
exodus.
Fache
had
hurried
off
as
well,
leaving
the
Grand
Gallery
deserted.
"There's
an
emergency
stairwell
about
fifty
meters
back
into
the
Grand
Gallery,"
Sophie
said.
"Now
that
the
guards
are
leaving
the
perimeter,
we
can
get
out
of
here."
Langdon
decided
not
to
say
another
word
all
evening.
Sophie
Neveu
was
clearly
a
hell
of
a
lot
smarter
than
he
was.
The
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice,
it
is
said,
has
the
most
eccentric
history
of
any
building
in
Paris.
Built
over
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
temple
to
the
Egyptian
goddess
Isis,
the
church
possesses
an
architectural
footprint
matching
that
of
Notre
Dame
to
within
inches.
The
sanctuary
has
played
host
to
the
baptisms
of
the
Marquis
de
Sade
and
Baudelaire,
as
well
as
the
marriage
of
Victor
Hugo.
The
attached
seminary
has
a
well
documented
history
of
unorthodoxy
and
was
once
the
clandestine
meeting
hall
for
numerous
secret
societies.
Tonight,
the
cavernous
nave
of
Saint
Sulpice
was
as
silent
as
a
tomb,
the
only
hint
of
life
the
faint
smell
of
incense
from
mass
earlier
that
evening.
Silas
sensed
an
uneasiness
in
Sister
Sandrine's
demeanor
as
she
led
him
into
the
sanctuary.
He
was
not
surprised
by
this.
Silas
was
accustomed
to
people
being
uncomfortable
with
his
appearance.
"You're
an
American,"
she
said.
"French
by
birth,"
Silas
responded.
"I
had
my
calling
in
Spain,
and
I
now
study
in
the
United
States."
Sister
Sandrine
nodded.
She
was
a
small
woman
with
quiet
eyes.
"And
you
have
never
seen
Saint
Sulpice?"
"I
realize
this
is
almost
a
sin
in
itself."
"She
is
more
beautiful
by
day."
"I
am
certain.
Nonetheless,
I
am
grateful
that
you
would
provide
me
this
opportunity
tonight."
"The
abbe
requested
it.
You
obviously
have
powerful
friends."
You
have
no
idea,
Silas
thought.
As
he
followed
Sister
Sandrine
down
the
main
aisle,
Silas
was
surprised
by
the
austerity
of
the
sanctuary.
Unlike
Notre
Dame
with
its
colorful
frescoes,
gilded
altar
work,
and
warm
wood,
Saint
Sulpice
was
stark
and
cold,
conveying
an
almost
barren
quality
reminiscent
of
the
ascetic
cathedrals
of
Spain.
The
lack
of
decor
made
the
interior
look
even
more
expansive,
and
as
Silas
gazed
up
into
the
soaring
ribbed
vault
of
the
ceiling,
he
imagined
he
was
standing
beneath
the
hull
of
an
enormous
overturned
ship.
A
fitting
image,
he
thought.
The
brotherhood's
ship
was
about
to
be
capsized
forever.
Feeling
eager
to
get
to
work,
Silas
wished
Sister
Sandrine
would
leave
him.
She
was
a
small
woman
whom
Silas
could
incapacitate
easily,
but
he
had
vowed
not
to
use
force
unless
absolutely
necessary.
She
is
a
woman
of
the
cloth,
and
it
is
not
her
fault
the
brotherhood
chose
her
church
as
a
hiding
place
for
their
keystone.
She
should
not
be
punished
for
the
sins
of
others.
"I
am
embarrassed,
Sister,
that
you
were
awoken
on
my
behalf."
"Not
at
all.
You
are
in
Paris
a
short
time.
You
should
not
miss
Saint
Sulpice.
Are
your
interests
in
the
church
more
architectural
or
historical?"
"Actually,
Sister,
my
interests
are
spiritual."
She
gave
a
pleasant
laugh.
"That
goes
without
saying.
I
simply
wondered
where
to
begin
your
tour."
Silas
felt
his
eyes
focus
on
the
altar.
"A
tour
is
unnecessary.
You
have
been
more
than
kind.
I
can
show
myself
around.
"It
is
no
trouble,"
she
said.
"After
all,
I
am
awake."
Silas
stopped
walking.
They
had
reached
the
front
pew
now,
and
the
altar
was
only
fifteen
yards
away.
He
turned
his
massive
body
fully
toward
the
small
woman,
and
he
could
sense
her
recoil
as
she
gazed
up
into
his
red
eyes.
"If
it
does
not
seem
too
rude,
Sister,
I
am
not
accustomed
to
simply
walking
into
a
house
of
God
and
taking
a
tour.
Would
you
mind
if
I
took
some
time
alone
to
pray
before
I
look
around?"
Sister
Sandrine
hesitated.
"Oh,
of
course.
I
shall
wait
in
the
rear
of
the
church
for
you."
Silas
put
a
soft
but
heavy
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
peered
down.
"Sister,
I
feel
guilty
already
for
having
awoken
you.
To
ask
you
to
stay
awake
is
too
much.
Please,
you
should
return
to
bed.
I
can
enjoy
your
sanctuary
and
then
let
myself
out."
She
looked
uneasy.
"Are
you
sure
you
won't
feel
abandoned?"
"Not
at
all.
Prayer
is
a
solitary
joy."
"As
you
wish."
Silas
took
his
hand
from
her
shoulder.
"Sleep
well,
Sister.
May
the
peace
of
the
Lord
be
with
you."
"And
also
with
you."
Sister
Sandrine
headed
for
the
stairs.
"Please
be
sure
the
door
closes
tightly
on
your
way
out."
"I
will
be
sure
of
it."
Silas
watched
her
climb
out
of
sight.
Then
he
turned
and
knelt
in
the
front
pew,
feeling
the
cilice
cut
into
his
leg.
Dear
God,
I
offer
up
to
you
this
work
I
do
today.
Crouching
in
the
shadows
of
the
choir
balcony
high
above
the
altar,
Sister
Sandrine
peered
silently
through
the
balustrade
at
the
cloaked
monk
kneeling
alone.
The
sudden
dread
in
her
soul
made
it
hard
to
stay
still.
For
a
fleeting
instant,
she
wondered
if
this
mysterious
visitor
could
be
the
enemy
they
had
warned
her
about,
and
if
tonight
she
would
have
to
carry
out
the
orders
she
had
been
holding
all
these
years.
She
decided
to
stay
there
in
the
darkness
and
watch
his
every
move.
Emerging
from
the
shadows,
Langdon
and
Sophie
moved
stealthily
up
the
deserted
Grand
Gallery
corridor
toward
the
emergency
exit
stairwell.
As
he
moved,
Langdon
felt
like
he
was
trying
to
assemble
a
jigsaw
puzzle
in
the
dark.
The
newest
aspect
of
this
mystery
was
a
deeply
troubling
one:
The
captain
of
the
Judicial
Police
is
trying
to
frame
me
for
murder
"Do
you
think,"
he
whispered,
"that
maybe
Fache
wrote
that
message
on
the
floor?"
Sophie
didn't
even
turn.
"Impossible."
Langdon
wasn't
so
sure.
"He
seems
pretty
intent
on
making
me
look
guilty.
Maybe
he
thought
writing
my
name
on
the
floor
would
help
his
case?"
"The
Fibonacci
sequence?
The
P.S.?
All
the
Da
Vinci
and
goddess
symbolism?
That
had
to
be
my
grandfather."
Langdon
knew
she
was
right.
The
symbolism
of
the
clues
meshed
too
perfectly
the
pentacle,
The
Vitruvian
Man,
Da
Vinci,
the
goddess,
and
even
the
Fibonacci
sequence.
A
coherent
symbolic
set,
as
iconographers
would
call
it.
All
inextricably
tied.
"And
his
phone
call
to
me
this
afternoon,"
Sophie
added.
"He
said
he
had
to
tell
me
something.
I'm
certain
his
message
at
the
Louvre
was
his
final
effort
to
tell
me
something
important,
something
he
thought
you
could
help
me
understand.
Langdon
frowned.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Oh,
lame
saint.
!
He
wished
he
could
comprehend
the
message,
both
for
Sophie's
well
being
and
for
his
own.
Things
had
definitely
gotten
worse
since
he
first
laid
eyes
on
the
cryptic
words.
His
fake
leap
out
the
bathroom
window
was
not
going
to
help
Langdon's
popularity
with
Fache
one
bit.
Somehow
he
doubted
the
captain
of
the
French
police
would
see
the
humor
in
chasing
down
and
arresting
a
bar
of
soap.
"The
doorway
isn't
much
farther,"
Sophie
said.
"Do
you
think
there's
a
possibility
that
the
numbers
in
your
grandfather's
message
hold
the
key
to
understanding
the
other
lines?"
Langdon
had
once
worked
on
a
series
of
Baconian
manuscripts
that
contained
epigraphical
ciphers
in
which
certain
lines
of
code
were
clues
as
to
how
to
decipher
the
other
lines.
"I've
been
thinking
about
the
numbers
all
night.
Sums,
quotients,
products.
I
don't
see
anything.
Mathematically,
they're
arranged
at
random.
Cryptographic
gibberish."
"And
yet
they're
all
part
of
the
Fibonacci
sequence.
That
can't
be
coincidence."
"It's
not.
Using
Fibonacci
numbers
was
my
grandfather's
way
of
waving
another
flag
at
me
like
writing
the
message
in
English,
or
arranging
himself
like
my
favorite
piece
of
art,
or
drawing
a
pentacle
on
himself.
All
of
it
was
to
catch
my
attention."
"The
pentacle
has
meaning
to
you?"
"Yes.
I
didn't
get
a
chance
to
tell
you,
but
the
pentacle
was
a
special
symbol
between
my
grandfather
and
me
when
I
was
growing
up.
We
used
to
play
Tarot
cards
for
fun,
and
my
indicator
card
always
turned
out
to
be
from
the
suit
of
pentacles.
I'm
sure
he
stacked
the
deck,
but
pentacles
got
to
be
our
little
joke."
Langdon
felt
a
chill.
They
played
Tarot?
The
medieval
Italian
card
game
was
so
replete
with
hidden
heretical
symbolism
that
Langdon
had
dedicated
an
entire
chapter
in
his
new
manuscript
to
the
Tarot.
The
game's
twenty
two
cards
bore
names
like
The
Female
Pope,
The
Empress,
and
The
Star.
Originally,
Tarot
had
been
devised
as
a
secret
means
to
pass
along
ideologies
banned
by
the
Church.
Now,
Tarot's
mystical
qualities
were
passed
on
by
modern
fortune
tellers.
The
Tarot
indicator
suit
for
feminine
divinity
is
pentacles,
Langdon
thought,
realizing
that
if
Sauniere
had
been
stacking
his
granddaughter's
deck
for
fun,
pentacles
was
an
apropos
inside
joke.
They
arrived
at
the
emergency
stairwell,
and
Sophie
carefully
pulled
open
the
door.
No
alarm
sounded.
Only
the
doors
to
the
outside
were
wired.
Sophie
led
Langdon
down
a
tight
set
of
switchback
stairs
toward
the
ground
level,
picking
up
speed
as
they
went.
"Your
grandfather,"
Langdon
said,
hurrying
behind
her,
"when
he
told
you
about
the
pentacle,
did
he
mention
goddess
worship
or
any
resentment
of
the
Catholic
Church?"
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"I
was
more
interested
in
the
mathematics
of
it
the
Divine
Proportion,
PHI,
Fibonacci
sequences,
that
sort
of
thing."
Langdon
was
surprised.
"Your
grandfather
taught
you
about
the
number
PHI?"
"Of
course.
The
Divine
Proportion."
Her
expression
turned
sheepish.
"In
fact,
he
used
to
joke
that
I
was
half
divine
you
know,
because
of
the
letters
in
my
name."
Langdon
considered
it
a
moment
and
then
groaned.
s
o
PHI
e.
Still
descending,
Langdon
refocused
on
PHI.
He
was
starting
to
realize
that
Sauniere's
clues
were
even
more
consistent
than
he
had
first
imagined.
Da
Vinci
Fibonacci
numbers
the
pentacle.
Incredibly,
all
of
these
things
were
connected
by
a
single
concept
so
fundamental
to
art
history
that
Langdon
often
spent
several
class
periods
on
the
topic.
PHI.
He
felt
himself
suddenly
reeling
back
to
Harvard,
standing
in
front
of
his
"Symbolism
in
Art"
class,
writing
his
favorite
number
on
the
chalkboard.
1.618
Langdon
turned
to
face
his
sea
of
eager
students.
"Who
can
tell
me
what
this
number
is?"
A
long
legged
math
major
in
back
raised
his
hand.
"That's
the
number
PHI."
He
pronounced
it
fee.
"Nice
job,
Stettner,"
Langdon
said.
"Everyone,
meet
PHI."
"Not
to
be
confused
with
PI,"
Stettner
added,
grinning.
"As
we
mathematicians
like
to
say:
PHI
is
one
H
of
a
lot
cooler
than
PI
!
Langdon
laughed,
but
nobody
else
seemed
to
get
the
joke.
Stettner
slumped.
"This
number
PHI,"
Langdon
continued,
"one
point
six
one
eight,
is
a
very
important
number
in
art.
Who
can
tell
me
why?"
Stettner
tried
to
redeem
himself.
"Because
it's
so
pretty?"
Everyone
laughed.
"Actually,"
Langdon
said,
"Stettner's
right
again.
PHI
is
generally
considered
the
most
beautiful
number
in
the
universe."
The
laughter
abruptly
stopped,
and
Stettner
gloated.
As
Langdon
loaded
his
slide
projector,
he
explained
that
the
number
PHI
was
derived
from
the
Fibonacci
sequence
a
progression
famous
not
only
because
the
sum
of
adjacent
terms
equaled
the
next
term,
but
because
the
quotients
of
adjacent
terms
possessed
the
astonishing
property
of
approaching
the
number
1.618
PHI!
Despite
PHI's
seemingly
mystical
mathematical
origins,
Langdon
explained,
the
truly
mind
boggling
aspect
of
PHI
was
its
role
as
a
fundamental
building
block
in
nature.
Plants,
animals,
and
even
human
beings
all
possessed
dimensional
properties
that
adhered
with
eerie
exactitude
to
the
ratio
of
PHI
to
1.
"PHI's
ubiquity
in
nature,"
Langdon
said,
killing
the
lights,
"clearly
exceeds
coincidence,
and
so
the
ancients
assumed
the
number
PHI
must
have
been
preordained
by
the
Creator
of
the
universe.
Early
scientists
heralded
one
point
six
one
eight
as
the
Divine
Proportion.
"Hold
on,"
said
a
young
woman
in
the
front
row.
"I'm
a
bio
major
and
I've
never
seen
this
Divine
Proportion
in
nature."
"No?"
Langdon
grinned.
"Ever
study
the
relationship
between
females
and
males
in
a
honeybee
community?"
"Sure.
The
female
bees
always
outnumber
the
male
bees."
"Correct.
And
did
you
know
that
if
you
divide
the
number
of
female
bees
by
the
number
of
male
bees
in
any
beehive
in
the
world,
you
always
get
the
same
number?"
"You
do?"
"Yup.
PHI."
The
girl
gaped.
"NO
WAY!"
"Way!"
Langdon
fired
back,
smiling
as
he
projected
a
slide
of
a
spiral
seashell.
"Recognize
this?"
"It's
a
nautilus,"
the
bio
major
said.
"A
cephalopod
mollusk
that
pumps
gas
into
its
chambered
shell
to
adjust
its
buoyancy."
"Correct.
And
can
you
guess
what
the
ratio
is
of
each
spiral's
diameter
to
the
next?"
The
girl
looked
uncertain
as
she
eyed
the
concentric
arcs
of
the
nautilus
spiral.
Langdon
nodded.
"PHI.
The
Divine
Proportion.
One
point
six
one
eight
to
one."
The
girl
looked
amazed.
Langdon
advanced
to
the
next
slide
a
close
up
of
a
sunflower's
seed
head.
"Sunflower
seeds
grow
in
opposing
spirals.
Can
you
guess
the
ratio
of
each
rotation's
diameter
to
the
next?"
"PHI?"
everyone
said.
"Bingo."
Langdon
began
racing
through
slides
now
spiraled
pinecone
petals,
leaf
arrangement
on
plant
stalks,
insect
segmentation
all
displaying
astonishing
obedience
to
the
Divine
Proportion.
"This
is
amazing!"
someone
cried
out.
"Yeah,"
someone
else
said,
"but
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
art?"
"Aha!"
Langdon
said.
"Glad
you
asked."
He
pulled
up
another
slide
a
pale
yellow
parchment
displaying
Leonardo
da
Vinci's
famous
male
nude
The
Vitruvian
Man
named
for
Marcus
Vitruvius,
the
brilliant
Roman
architect
who
praised
the
Divine
Proportion
in
his
text
De
Architectura.
"Nobody
understood
better
than
Da
Vinci
the
divine
structure
of
the
human
body.
Da
Vinci
actually
exhumed
corpses
to
measure
the
exact
proportions
of
human
bone
structure.
He
was
the
first
to
show
that
the
human
body
is
literally
made
of
building
blocks
whose
proportional
ratios
always
equal
PHI."
Everyone
in
class
gave
him
a
dubious
look.
"Don't
believe
me?"
Langdon
challenged.
"Next
time
you're
in
the
shower,
take
a
tape
measure."
A
couple
of
football
players
snickered.
"Not
just
you
insecure
jocks,"
Langdon
prompted.
"All
of
you.
Guys
and
girls.
Try
it.
Measure
the
distance
from
the
tip
of
your
head
to
the
floor.
Then
divide
that
by
the
distance
from
your
belly
button
to
the
floor.
Guess
what
number
you
get."
"Not
PHI!"
one
of
the
jocks
blurted
out
in
disbelief.
"Yes,
PHI,"
Langdon
replied.
"One
point
six
one
eight.
Want
another
example?
Measure
the
distance
from
your
shoulder
to
your
fingertips,
and
then
divide
it
by
the
distance
from
your
elbow
to
your
fingertips.
PHI
again.
Another?
Hip
to
floor
divided
by
knee
to
floor.
PHI
again.
Finger
joints.
Toes.
Spinal
divisions.
PHI.
PHI.
PHI.
My
friends,
each
of
you
is
a
walking
tribute
to
the
Divine
Proportion.
Even
in
the
darkness,
Langdon
could
see
they
were
all
astounded.
He
felt
a
familiar
warmth
inside.
This
is
why
he
taught.
"My
friends,
as
you
can
see,
the
chaos
of
the
world
has
an
underlying
order.
When
the
ancients
discovered
PHI,
they
were
certain
they
had
stumbled
across
God's
building
block
for
the
world,
and
they
worshipped
Nature
because
of
that.
And
one
can
understand
why.
God's
hand
is
evident
in
Nature,
and
even
to
this
day
there
exist
pagan,
Mother
Earth
revering
religions.
Many
of
us
celebrate
nature
the
way
the
pagans
did,
and
don't
even
know
it.
May
Day
is
a
perfect
example,
the
celebration
of
spring
the
earth
coming
back
to
life
to
produce
her
bounty.
The
mysterious
magic
inherent
in
the
Divine
Proportion
was
written
at
the
beginning
of
time.
Man
is
simply
playing
by
Nature's
rules,
and
because
art
is
man's
attempt
to
imitate
the
beauty
of
the
Creator's
hand,
you
can
imagine
we
might
be
seeing
a
lot
of
instances
of
the
Divine
Proportion
in
art
this
semester."
Over
the
next
half
hour,
Langdon
showed
them
slides
of
artwork
by
Michelangelo,
Albrecht
Diirer,
Da
Vinci,
and
many
others,
demonstrating
each
artist's
intentional
and
rigorous
adherence
to
the
Divine
Proportion
in
the
layout
of
his
compositions.
Langdon
unveiled
PHI
in
the
architectural
dimensions
of
the
Greek
Parthenon,
the
pyramids
of
Egypt,
and
even
the
United
Nations
Building
in
New
York.
PHI
appeared
in
the
organizational
structures
of
Mozart's
sonatas,
Beethoven's
Fifth
Symphony,
as
well
as
the
works
of
Bartok,
Debussy,
and
Schubert.
The
number
PHI,
Langdon
told
them,
was
even
used
by
Stradivarius
to
calculate
the
exact
placement
of
the
f
holes
in
the
construction
of
his
famous
violins.
"In
closing,"
Langdon
said,
walking
to
the
chalkboard,
"we
return
to
symbols"
He
drew
five
intersecting
lines
that
formed
a
five
pointed
star.
"This
symbol
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
images
you
will
see
this
term.
Formally
known
as
a
pentagram
or
pentacle,
as
the
ancients
called
it
this
symbol
is
considered
both
divine
and
magical
by
many
cultures.
Can
anyone
tell
me
why
that
might
be?"
Stettner,
the
math
major,
raised
his
hand.
"Because
if
you
draw
a
pentagram,
the
lines
automatically
divide
themselves
into
segments
according
to
the
Divine
Proportion."
Langdon
gave
the
kid
a
proud
nod.
"Nice
job.
Yes,
the
ratios
of
line
segments
in
a
pentacle
all
equal
PHI,
making
this
symbol
the
ultimate
expression
of
the
Divine
Proportion.
For
this
reason,
the
five
pointed
star
has
always
been
the
symbol
for
beauty
and
perfection
associated
with
the
goddess
and
the
sacred
feminine."
The
girls
in
class
beamed.
"One
note,
folks.
We've
only
touched
on
Da
Vinci
today,
but
we'll
be
seeing
a
lot
more
of
him
this
semester.
Leonardo
was
a
well
documented
devotee
of
the
ancient
ways
of
the
goddess.
Tomorrow,
I'll
show
you
his
fresco
The
Last
Supper,
which
is
one
of
the
most
astonishing
tributes
to
the
sacred
feminine
you
will
ever
see."
"You're
kidding,
right?"
somebody
said.
"I
thought
The
Last
Supper
was
about
Jesus!'
Langdon
winked.
"There
are
symbols
hidden
in
places
you
would
never
imagine."
"Come
on,"
Sophie
whispered.
"What's
wrong?
We're
almost
there.
Hurry!"
Langdon
glanced
up,
feeling
himself
return
from
faraway
thoughts.
He
realized
he
was
standing
at
a
dead
stop
on
the
stairs,
paralyzed
by
sudden
revelation.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Oh,
lame
saint!
Sophie
was
looking
back
at
him.
It
can
't
be
that
simple,
Langdon
thought.
But
he
knew
of
course
that
it
was.
There
in
the
bowels
of
the
Louvre
with
images
of
PHI
and
Da
Vinci
swirling
through
his
mind,
Robert
Langdon
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
deciphered
Sauniere's
code.
"O,
Draconian
devil!"
he
said.
"Oh,
lame
saint!
It's
the
simplest
kind
of
code!"
Sophie
was
stopped
on
the
stairs
below
him,
staring
up
in
confusion.
A
code?
She
had
been
pondering
the
words
all
night
and
had
not
seen
a
code.
Especially
a
simple
one.
"You
said
it
yourself."
Langdon's
voice
reverberated
with
excitement.
"Fibonacci
numbers
only
have
meaning
in
their
proper
order.
Otherwise
they're
mathematical
gibberish.
Sophie
had
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about.
The
Fibonacci
numbers?
She
was
certain
they
had
been
intended
as
nothing
more
than
a
means
to
get
the
Cryptography
Department
involved
tonight.
They
have
another
purpose?
She
plunged
her
hand
into
her
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
printout,
studying
her
grandfather's
message
again.

O,
Draconian
devil
!
Oh,
lame
saint!
What
about
the
numbers
?
"The
scrambled
Fibonacci
sequence
is
a
clue,"
Langdon
said,
taking
the
printout.
"The
numbers
are
a
hint
as
to
how
to
decipher
the
rest
of
the
message.
He
wrote
the
sequence
out
of
order
to
tell
us
to
apply
the
same
concept
to
the
text.
O,
Draconian
devil?
Oh,
lame
saint?
Those
lines
mean
nothing.
They
are
simply
letters
written
out
of
order."
Sophie
needed
only
an
instant
to
process
Langdon's
implication,
and
it
seemed
laughably
simple.
"You
think
this
message
is
une
anagramme?"
She
stared
at
him.
"Like
a
word
jumble
from
a
newspaper?"
Langdon
could
see
the
skepticism
on
Sophie's
face
and
certainly
understood.
Few
people
realized
that
anagrams,
despite
being
a
trite
modern
amusement,
had
a
rich
history
of
sacred
symbolism.
The
mystical
teachings
of
the
Kabbala
drew
heavily
on
anagrams
rearranging
the
letters
of
Hebrew
words
to
derive
new
meanings.
French
kings
throughout
the
Renaissance
were
so
convinced
that
anagrams
held
magic
power
that
they
appointed
royal
anagrammatists
to
help
them
make
better
decisions
by
analyzing
words
in
important
documents.
The
Romans
actually
referred
to
the
study
of
anagrams
as
ars
magna
"the
great
art."
Langdon
looked
up
at
Sophie,
locking
eyes
with
her
now.
"Your
grandfather's
meaning
was
right
in
front
of
us
all
along,
and
he
left
us
more
than
enough
clues
to
see
it.
Without
another
word,
Langdon
pulled
a
pen
from
his
jacket
pocket
and
rearranged
the
letters
in
each
line.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Oh,
lame
saint!
was
a
perfect
anagram
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci!
The
Mona
Lisa!
The
Mona
Lisa.
For
an
instant,
standing
in
the
exit
stairwell,
Sophie
forgot
all
about
trying
to
leave
the
Louvre.
Her
shock
over
the
anagram
was
matched
only
by
her
embarrassment
at
not
having
deciphered
the
message
herself.
Sophie's
expertise
in
complex
cryptanalysis
had
caused
her
to
overlook
simplistic
word
games,
and
yet
she
knew
she
should
have
seen
it.
After
all,
she
was
no
stranger
to
anagrams
especially
in
English.
When
she
was
young,
often
her
grandfather
would
use
anagram
games
to
hone
her
English
spelling.
Once
he
had
written
the
English
word
"planets"
and
told
Sophie
that
an
astonishing
sixty
two
other
English
words
of
varying
lengths
could
be
formed
using
those
same
letters.
Sophie
had
spent
three
days
with
an
English
dictionary
until
she
found
them
all.
"I
can't
imagine,"
Langdon
said,
staring
at
the
printout,
"how
your
grandfather
created
such
an
intricate
anagram
in
the
minutes
before
he
died."
Sophie
knew
the
explanation,
and
the
realization
made
her
feel
even
worse.
should
have
seen
this!
She
now
recalled
that
her
grandfather
a
wordplay
aficionado
and
art
lover
had
entertained
himself
as
a
young
man
by
creating
anagrams
of
famous
works
of
art.
In
fact,
one
of
his
anagrams
had
gotten
him
in
trouble
once
when
Sophie
was
a
little
girl.
While
being
interviewed
by
an
American
art
magazine,
Sauniere
had
expressed
his
distaste
for
the
modernist
Cubist
movement
by
noting
that
Picasso's
masterpiece
Les
Demoiselles
d
'Avignon
was
a
perfect
anagram
of
vile
meaningless
doodles.
Picasso
fans
were
not
amused.
"My
grandfather
probably
created
this
Mona
Lisa
anagram
long
ago,"
Sophie
said,
glancing
up
at
Langdon.
And
tonight
he
was
forced
to
use
it
as
a
makeshift
code.
Her
grandfather's
voice
had
called
out
from
beyond
with
chilling
precision.
Leonardo
da
Vinci!
The
Mona
Lisa!
Why
his
final
words
to
her
referenced
the
famous
painting,
Sophie
had
no
idea,
but
she
could
think
of
only
one
possibility.
A
disturbing
one.
Those
were
not
his
final
words.
Was
she
supposed
to
visit
the
Mona
Lisa?
Had
her
grandfather
left
her
a
message
there?
The
idea
seemed
perfectly
plausible.
After
all,
the
famous
painting
hung
in
the
Salle
des
Etats
a
private
viewing
chamber
accessible
only
from
the
Grand
Gallery.
In
fact,
Sophie
now
realized,
the
doors
that
opened
into
the
chamber
were
situated
only
twenty
meters
from
where
her
grandfather
had
been
found
dead.
He
easily
could
have
visited
the
Mona
Lisa
before
he
died.
Sophie
gazed
back
up
the
emergency
stairwell
and
felt
torn.
She
knew
she
should
usher
Langdon
from
the
museum
immediately,
and
yet
instinct
urged
her
to
the
contrary.
As
Sophie
recalled
her
first
childhood
visit
to
the
Denon
Wing,
she
realized
that
if
her
grandfather
had
a
secret
to
tell
her,
few
places
on
earth
made
a
more
apt
rendezvous
than
Da
Vinci's
Mona
Lisa.
"She's
just
a
little
bit
farther,"
her
grandfather
had
whispered,
clutching
Sophie's
tiny
hand
as
he
led
her
through
the
deserted
museum
after
hours.
Sophie
was
six
years
old.
She
felt
small
and
insignificant
as
she
gazed
up
at
the
enormous
ceilings
and
down
at
the
dizzying
floor.
The
empty
museum
frightened
her,
although
she
was
not
about
to
let
her
grandfather
know
that.
She
set
her
jaw
firmly
and
let
go
of
his
hand.
"Up
ahead
is
the
Salle
des
Etats,"
her
grandfather
said
as
they
approached
the
Louvre's
most
famous
room.
Despite
her
grandfather's
obvious
excitement,
Sophie
wanted
to
go
home.
She
had
seen
pictures
of
the
Mona
Lisa
in
books
and
didn't
like
it
at
all.
She
couldn't
understand
why
everyone
made
such
a
fuss.
"C'est
ennuyeux,
"
Sophie
grumbled.
"Boring,"
he
corrected.
"French
at
school.
English
at
home."
"Le
Louvre,
c'est
pas
chez
moil"
she
challenged.
He
gave
her
a
tired
laugh.
"Right
you
are.
Then
let's
speak
English
just
for
fun."
Sophie
pouted
and
kept
walking.
As
they
entered
the
Salle
des
Etats,
her
eyes
scanned
the
narrow
room
and
settled
on
the
obvious
spot
of
honor
the
center
of
the
right
hand
wall,
where
a
lone
portrait
hung
behind
a
protective
Plexiglas
wall.
Her
grandfather
paused
in
the
doorway
and
motioned
toward
the
painting.
"Go
ahead,
Sophie.
Not
many
people
get
a
chance
to
visit
her
alone."
Swallowing
her
apprehension,
Sophie
moved
slowly
across
the
room.
After
everything
she'd
heard
about
the
Mona
Lisa,
she
felt
as
if
she
were
approaching
royalty.
Arriving
in
front
of
the
protective
Plexiglas,
Sophie
held
her
breath
and
looked
up,
taking
it
in
all
at
once.
Sophie
was
not
sure
what
she
had
expected
to
feel,
but
it
most
certainly
was
not
this.
No
jolt
of
amazement.
No
instant
of
wonder.
The
famous
face
looked
as
it
did
in
books.
She
stood
in
silence
for
what
felt
like
forever,
waiting
for
something
to
happen.
"So
what
do
you
think?"
her
grandfather
whispered,
arriving
behind
her.
"Beautiful,
yes?"
"She's
too
little."
Sauniere
smiled.
"You're
little
and
you're
beautiful."
am
not
beautiful,
she
thought.
Sophie
hated
her
red
hair
and
freckles,
and
she
was
bigger
than
all
the
boys
in
her
class.
She
looked
back
at
the
Mona
Lisa
and
shook
her
head.
"She's
even
worse
than
in
the
books.
Her
face
is
brumeux.
"Foggy,"
her
grandfather
tutored.
"Foggy,"
Sophie
repeated,
knowing
the
conversation
would
not
continue
until
she
repeated
her
new
vocabulary
word.
"That's
called
the
sfumato
style
of
painting,"
he
told
her,
"and
it's
very
hard
to
do.
Leonardo
da
Vinci
was
better
at
it
than
anyone."
Sophie
still
didn't
like
the
painting.
"She
looks
like
she
knows
something
like
when
kids
at
school
have
a
secret.
Her
grandfather
laughed.
"That's
part
of
why
she
is
so
famous.
People
like
to
guess
why
she
is
smiling."
"Do
you
know
why
she's
smiling?"
"Maybe."
Her
grandfather
winked.
"Someday
I'll
tell
you
all
about
it."
Sophie
stamped
her
foot.
"I
told
you
I
don't
like
secrets!"
"Princess,"
he
smiled.
"Life
is
filled
with
secrets.
You
can't
learn
them
all
at
once."
"I'm
going
back
up,"
Sophie
declared,
her
voice
hollow
in
the
stairwell.
"To
the
Mona
Lisa?"
Langdon
recoiled.
"Now?"
Sophie
considered
the
risk.
"I'm
not
a
murder
suspect.
I'll
take
my
chances.
I
need
to
understand
what
my
grandfather
was
trying
to
tell
me."
"What
about
the
embassy?"
Sophie
felt
guilty
turning
Langdon
into
a
fugitive
only
to
abandon
him,
but
she
saw
no
other
option.
She
pointed
down
the
stairs
to
a
metal
door.
"Go
through
that
door,
and
follow
the
illuminated
exit
signs.
My
grandfather
used
to
bring
me
down
here.
The
signs
will
lead
you
to
a
security
turnstile.
It's
monodirectional
and
opens
out."
She
handed
Langdon
her
car
keys.
"Mine
is
the
red
SmartCar
in
the
employee
lot.
Directly
outside
this
bulkhead.
Do
you
know
how
to
get
to
the
embassy?"
Langdon
nodded,
eyeing
the
keys
in
his
hand.
"Listen,"
Sophie
said,
her
voice
softening.
"I
think
my
grandfather
may
have
left
me
a
message
at
the
Mona
Lisa
some
kind
of
clue
as
to
who
killed
him.
Or
why
I'm
in
danger."
Or
what
happened
to
my
family.
"I
have
to
go
see."
"But
if
he
wanted
to
tell
you
why
you
were
in
danger,
why
wouldn't
he
simply
write
it
on
the
floor
where
he
died?
Why
this
complicated
word
game?"
"Whatever
my
grandfather
was
trying
to
tell
me,
I
don't
think
he
wanted
anyone
else
to
hear
it.
Not
even
the
police."
Clearly,
her
grandfather
had
done
everything
in
his
power
to
send
a
confidential
transmission
directly
to
her.
He
had
written
it
in
code,
included
her
secret
initials,
and
told
her
to
find
Robert
Langdon
a
wise
command,
considering
the
American
symbologist
had
deciphered
his
code.
"As
strange
as
it
may
sound,"
Sophie
said,
"I
think
he
wants
me
to
get
to
the
Mona
Lisa
before
anyone
else
does."
"I'llcome."
"No!
We
don't
know
how
long
the
Grand
Gallery
will
stay
empty.
You
have
to
go."
Langdon
seemed
hesitant,
as
if
his
own
academic
curiosity
were
threatening
to
override
sound
judgment
and
drag
him
back
into
Fache's
hands.
"Go.
Now."
Sophie
gave
him
a
grateful
smile.
"I'll
see
you
at
the
embassy,
Mr.
Langdon."
Langdon
looked
displeased.
"I'll
meet
you
there
on
one
condition,"
he
replied,
his
voice
stern.
She
paused,
startled.
"What's
that?"
"That
you
stop
calling
me
Mr.
Langdon."
Sophie
detected
the
faint
hint
of
a
lopsided
grin
growing
across
Langdon's
face,
and
she
felt
herself
smile
back.
"Good
luck,
Robert."
When
Langdon
reached
the
landing
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs,
the
unmistakable
smell
of
linseed
oil
and
plaster
dust
assaulted
his
nostrils.
Ahead,
an
illuminated
SORTIEEXIT
displayed
an
arrow
pointing
down
a
long
corridor.
Langdon
stepped
into
the
hallway.
To
the
right
gaped
a
murky
restoration
studio
out
of
which
peered
an
army
of
statues
in
various
states
of
repair.
To
the
left,
Langdon
saw
a
suite
of
studios
that
resembled
Harvard
art
classrooms
rows
of
easels,
paintings,
palettes,
framing
tools
an
art
assembly
line.
As
he
moved
down
the
hallway,
Langdon
wondered
if
at
any
moment
he
might
awake
with
a
start
in
his
bed
in
Cambridge.
The
entire
evening
had
felt
like
a
bizarre
dream.
I'm
about
to
dash
out
of
the
Louvre
a
fugitive.
Sauniere's
clever
anagrammatic
message
was
still
on
his
mind,
and
Langdon
wondered
what
Sophie
would
find
at
the
Mona
Lisa
if
anything.
She
had
seemed
certain
her
grandfather
meant
for
her
to
visit
the
famous
painting
one
more
time.
As
plausible
an
interpretation
as
this
seemed,
Langdon
felt
haunted
now
by
a
troubling
paradox.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Sauniere
had
written
Langdon's
name
on
the
floor,
commanding
Sophie
to
find
him.
But
why?
Merely
so
Langdon
could
help
her
break
an
anagram?
It
seemed
quite
unlikely.
After
all,
Sauniere
had
no
reason
to
think
Langdon
was
especially
skilled
at
anagrams.
We've
never
even
met.
More
important,
Sophie
had
stated
flat
out
that
she
should
have
broken
the
anagram
on
her
own.
It
had
been
Sophie
who
spotted
the
Fibonacci
sequence,
and,
no
doubt,
Sophie
who,
if
given
a
little
more
time,
would
have
deciphered
the
message
with
no
help
from
Langdon.
Sophie
was
supposed
to
break
that
anagram
on
her
own.
Langdon
was
suddenly
feeling
more
certain
about
this,
and
yet
the
conclusion
left
an
obvious
gaping
lapse
in
the
logic
of
Sauniere's
actions.
Why
me?
Langdon
wondered,
heading
down
the
hall.
Why
was
Sauniere's
dying
wish
that
his
estranged
granddaughter
find
me?
What
is
it
that
Sauniere
thinks
I
know?
With
an
unexpected
jolt,
Langdon
stopped
short.
Eyes
wide,
he
dug
in
his
pocket
and
yanked
out
the
computer
printout.
He
stared
at
the
last
line
of
Sauniere's
message.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
He
fixated
on
two
letters.
P.S.
In
that
instant,
Langdon
felt
Sauniere's
puzzling
mix
of
symbolism
fall
into
stark
focus.
Like
a
peal
of
thunder,
a
career's
worth
of
symbology
and
history
came
crashing
down
around
him.
Everything
Jacques
Sauniere
had
done
tonight
suddenly
made
perfect
sense.
Langdon's
thoughts
raced
as
he
tried
to
assemble
the
implications
of
what
this
all
meant.
Wheeling,
he
stared
back
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come.
Is
there
time
?
He
knew
it
didn't
matter.
Without
hesitation,
Langdon
broke
into
a
sprint
back
toward
the
stairs.
Kneeling
in
the
first
pew,
Silas
pretended
to
pray
as
he
scanned
the
layout
of
the
sanctuary.
Saint
Sulpice,
like
most
churches,
had
been
built
in
the
shape
of
a
giant
Roman
cross.
Its
long
central
section
the
nave
led
directly
to
the
main
altar,
where
it
was
transversely
intersected
by
a
shorter
section,
known
as
the
transept.
The
intersection
of
nave
and
transept
occurred
directly
beneath
the
main
cupola
and
was
considered
the
heart
of
the
church
her
most
sacred
and
mystical
point.
Not
tonight,
Silas
thought.
Saint
Sulpice
hides
her
secrets
elsewhere.
Turning
his
head
to
the
right,
he
gazed
into
the
south
transept,
toward
the
open
area
of
floor
beyond
the
end
of
the
pews,
to
the
object
his
victims
had
described.
There
it
is.
Embedded
in
the
gray
granite
floor,
a
thin
polished
strip
of
brass
glistened
in
the
stone
a
golden
line
slanting
across
the
church's
floor.
The
line
bore
graduated
markings,
like
a
ruler.
It
was
a
gnomon,
Silas
had
been
told,
a
pagan
astronomical
device
like
a
sundial.
Tourists,
scientists,
historians,
and
pagans
from
around
the
world
came
to
Saint
Sulpice
to
gaze
upon
this
famous
line.
The
Rose
Line.
Slowly,
Silas
let
his
eyes
trace
the
path
of
the
brass
strip
as
it
made
its
way
across
the
floor
from
his
right
to
left,
slanting
in
front
of
him
at
an
awkward
angle,
entirely
at
odds
with
the
symmetry
of
the
church.
Slicing
across
the
main
altar
itself,
the
line
looked
to
Silas
like
a
slash
wound
across
a
beautiful
face.
The
strip
cleaved
the
communion
rail
in
two
and
then
crossed
the
entire
width
of
the
church,
finally
reaching
the
corner
of
the
north
transept,
where
it
arrived
at
the
base
of
a
most
unexpected
structure.
A
colossal
Egyptian
obelisk.
Here,
the
glistening
Rose
Line
took
a
ninety
degree
vertical
turn
and
continued
directly
up
the
face
of
the
obelisk
itself,
ascending
thirty
three
feet
to
the
very
tip
of
the
pyramidical
apex,
where
it
finally
ceased.
The
Rose
Line,
Silas
thought.
The
brotherhood
hid
the
keystone
at
the
Rose
Line.
Earlier
tonight,
when
Silas
told
the
Teacher
that
the
Priory
keystone
was
hidden
inside
Saint
Sulpice,
the
Teacher
had
sounded
doubtful.
But
when
Silas
added
that
the
brothers
had
all
given
him
a
precise
location,
with
relation
to
a
brass
line
running
through
Saint
Sulpice,
the
Teacher
had
gasped
with
revelation.
"You
speak
of
the
Rose
Line!"
The
Teacher
quickly
told
Silas
of
Saint
Sulpice's
famed
architectural
oddity
a
strip
of
brass
that
segmented
the
sanctuary
on
a
perfect
north
south
axis.
It
was
an
ancient
sundial
of
sorts,
a
vestige
of
the
pagan
temple
that
had
once
stood
on
this
very
spot.
The
sun's
rays,
shining
through
the
oculus
on
the
south
wall,
moved
farther
down
the
line
every
day,
indicating
the
passage
of
time,
from
solstice
to
solstice.
The
north
south
stripe
had
been
known
as
the
Rose
Line.
For
centuries,
the
symbol
of
the
Rose
had
been
associated
with
maps
and
guiding
souls
in
the
proper
direction.
The
Compass
Rose
drawn
on
almost
every
map
indicated
North,
East,
South,
and
West.
Originally
known
as
the
Wind
Rose,
it
denoted
the
directions
of
the
thirty
two
winds,
blowing
from
the
directions
of
eight
major
winds,
eight
half
winds,
and
sixteen
quarter
winds.
When
diagrammed
inside
a
circle,
these
thirty
two
points
of
the
compass
perfectly
resembled
a
traditional
thirty
two
petal
rose
bloom.
To
this
day,
the
fundamental
navigational
tool
was
still
known
as
a
Compass
Rose,
its
northernmost
direction
still
marked
by
an
arrowhead
or,
more
commonly,
the
symbol
of
the
fleur
de
lis.
On
a
globe,
a
Rose
Line
also
called
a
meridian
or
longitude
was
any
imaginary
line
drawn
from
the
North
Pole
to
the
South
Pole.
There
were,
of
course,
an
infinite
number
of
Rose
Lines
because
every
point
on
the
globe
could
have
a
longitude
drawn
through
it
connecting
north
and
south
poles.
The
question
for
early
navigators
was
which
of
these
lines
would
be
called
the
Rose
Line
the
zero
longitude
the
line
from
which
all
other
longitudes
on
earth
would
be
measured.
Today
that
line
was
in
Greenwich,
England.
But
it
had
not
always
been.
Long
before
the
establishment
of
Greenwich
as
the
prime
meridian,
the
zero
longitude
of
the
entire
world
had
passed
directly
through
Paris,
and
through
the
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice.
The
brass
marker
in
Saint
Sulpice
was
a
memorial
to
the
world's
first
prime
meridian,
and
although
Greenwich
had
stripped
Paris
of
the
honor
in
1888,
the
original
Rose
Line
was
still
visible
today.
"And
so
the
legend
is
true,"
the
Teacher
had
told
Silas.
"The
Priory
keystone
has
been
said
to
lie
'beneath
the
Sign
of
the
Rose.'
Now,
still
on
his
knees
in
a
pew,
Silas
glanced
around
the
church
and
listened
to
make
sure
no
one
was
there.
For
a
moment,
he
thought
he
heard
a
rustling
in
the
choir
balcony.
He
turned
and
gazed
up
for
several
seconds.
Nothing.
am
alone.
Standing
now,
he
faced
the
altar
and
genuflected
three
times.
Then
he
turned
left
and
followed
the
brass
line
due
north
toward
the
obelisk.
At
that
moment,
at
Leonardo
da
Vinci
International
Airport
in
Rome,
the
jolt
of
tires
hitting
the
runway
startled
Bishop
Aringarosa
from
his
slumber.
drifted
off,
he
thought,
impressed
he
was
relaxed
enough
to
sleep.
"Benvenuto
a
Roma,
"
the
intercom
announced.
Sitting
up,
Aringarosa
straightened
his
black
cassock
and
allowed
himself
a
rare
smile.
This
was
one
trip
he
had
been
happy
to
make.
have
been
on
the
defensive
for
too
long.
Tonight,
however,
the
rules
had
changed.
Only
five
months
ago,
Aringarosa
had
feared
for
the
future
of
the
Faith.
Now,
as
if
by
the
will
of
God,
the
solution
had
presented
itself.
Divine
intervention.
If
all
went
as
planned
tonight
in
Paris,
Aringarosa
would
soon
be
in
possession
of
something
that
would
make
him
the
most
powerful
man
in
Christendom.
Sophie
arrived
breathless
outside
the
large
wooden
doors
of
the
Salle
des
Etats
the
room
that
housed
the
Mona
Lisa.
Before
entering,
she
gazed
reluctantly
farther
down
the
hall,
twenty
yards
or
so,
to
the
spot
where
her
grandfather's
body
still
lay
under
the
spotlight.
The
remorse
that
gripped
her
was
powerful
and
sudden,
a
deep
sadness
laced
with
guilt.
The
man
had
reached
out
to
her
so
many
times
over
the
past
ten
years,
and
yet
Sophie
had
remained
immovable
leaving
his
letters
and
packages
unopened
in
a
bottom
drawer
and
denying
his
efforts
to
see
her.
He
lied
to
me!
Kept
appalling
secrets!
What
was
I
supposed
to
do
?
And
so
she
had
blocked
him
out.
Completely.
Now
her
grandfather
was
dead,
and
he
was
talking
to
her
from
the
grave.
The
Mona
Lisa.
She
reached
for
the
huge
wooden
doors,
and
pushed.
The
entryway
yawned
open.
Sophie
stood
on
the
threshold
a
moment,
scanning
the
large
rectangular
chamber
beyond.
It
too
was
bathed
in
a
soft
red
light.
The
Salle
des
Etats
was
one
of
this
museum's
rare
culs
de
sac
a
dead
end
and
the
only
room
off
the
middle
of
the
Grand
Gallery.
This
door,
the
chamber's
sole
point
of
entry,
faced
a
dominating
fifteen
foot
Botticelli
on
the
far
wall.
Beneath
it,
centered
on
the
parquet
floor,
an
immense
octagonal
viewing
divan
served
as
a
welcome
respite
for
thousands
of
visitors
to
rest
their
legs
while
they
admired
the
Louvre's
most
valuable
asset.
Even
before
Sophie
entered,
though,
she
knew
she
was
missing
something.
A
black
light.
She
gazed
down
the
hall
at
her
grandfather
under
the
lights
in
the
distance,
surrounded
by
electronic
gear.
If
he
had
written
anything
in
here,
he
almost
certainly
would
have
written
it
with
the
watermark
stylus.
Taking
a
deep
breath,
Sophie
hurried
down
to
the
well
lit
crime
scene.
Unable
to
look
at
her
grandfather,
she
focused
solely
on
the
PTS
tools.
Finding
a
small
ultraviolet
penlight,
she
slipped
it
in
the
pocket
of
her
sweater
and
hurried
back
up
the
hallway
toward
the
open
doors
of
the
Salle
des
Etats.
Sophie
turned
the
corner
and
stepped
over
the
threshold.
Her
entrance,
however,
was
met
by
an
unexpected
sound
of
muffled
footsteps
racing
toward
her
from
inside
the
chamber.
There
's
someone
in
here!
A
ghostly
figure
emerged
suddenly
from
out
of
the
reddish
haze.
Sophie
jumped
back.
"There
you
are!"
Langdon's
hoarse
whisper
cut
the
air
as
his
silhouette
slid
to
a
stop
in
front
of
her.
Her
relief
was
only
momentary.
"Robert,
I
told
you
to
get
out
of
here!
If
Fache
"Where
were
you?"
"I
had
to
get
the
black
light,"
she
whispered,
holding
it
up.
"If
my
grandfather
left
me
a
message
"Sophie,
listen."
Langdon
caught
his
breath
as
his
blue
eyes
held
her
firmly.
"The
letters
P.S.
do
they
mean
anything
else
to
you?
Anything
at
all?"
Afraid
their
voices
might
echo
down
the
hall,
Sophie
pulled
him
into
the
Salle
des
Etats
and
closed
the
enormous
twin
doors
silently,
sealing
them
inside.
"I
told
you,
the
initials
mean
Princess
Sophie."
"I
know,
but
did
you
ever
see
them
anywhere
else?
Did
your
grandfather
ever
use
P.S.
in
any
other
way?
As
a
monogram,
or
maybe
on
stationery
or
a
personal
item?"
The
question
startled
her.
How
would
Robert
know
that?
Sophie
had
indeed
seen
the
initials
P.S.
once
before,
in
a
kind
of
monogram.
It
was
the
day
before
her
ninth
birthday.
She
was
secretly
combing
the
house,
searching
for
hidden
birthday
presents.
Even
then,
she
could
not
bear
secrets
kept
from
her.
What
did
Grand
pere
get
for
me
this
year?
She
dug
through
cupboards
and
drawers.
Did
he
get
me
the
doll
I
wanted?
Where
would
he
hide
it?
Finding
nothing
in
the
entire
house,
Sophie
mustered
the
courage
to
sneak
into
her
grandfather's
bedroom.
The
room
was
off
limits
to
her,
but
her
grandfather
was
downstairs
asleep
on
the
couch.
I'll
just
take
a
fast
peek!
Tiptoeing
across
the
creaky
wood
floor
to
his
closet,
Sophie
peered
on
the
shelves
behind
his
clothing.
Nothing.
Next
she
looked
under
the
bed.
Still
nothing.
Moving
to
his
bureau,
she
opened
the
drawers
and
one
by
one
began
pawing
carefully
through
them.
There
must
be
something
for
me
here!
As
she
reached
the
bottom
drawer,
she
still
had
not
found
any
hint
of
a
doll.
Dejected,
she
opened
the
final
drawer
and
pulled
aside
some
black
clothes
she
had
never
seen
him
wear.
She
was
about
to
close
the
drawer
when
her
eyes
caught
a
glint
of
gold
in
the
back
of
the
drawer.
It
looked
like
a
pocket
watch
chain,
but
she
knew
he
didn't
wear
one.
Her
heart
raced
as
she
realized
what
it
must
be.
A
necklace!
Sophie
carefully
pulled
the
chain
from
the
drawer.
To
her
surprise,
on
the
end
was
a
brilliant
gold
key.
Heavy
and
shimmering.
Spellbound,
she
held
it
up.
It
looked
like
no
key
she
had
ever
seen.
Most
keys
were
flat
with
jagged
teeth,
but
this
one
had
a
triangular
column
with
little
pockmarks
all
over
it.
Its
large
golden
head
was
in
the
shape
of
a
cross,
but
not
a
normal
cross.
This
was
an
even
armed
one,
like
a
plus
sign.
Embossed
in
the
middle
of
the
cross
was
a
strange
symbol
two
letters
intertwined
with
some
kind
of
flowery
design.
"P.S.,"
she
whispered,
scowling
as
she
read
the
letters.
Whatever
could
this
be?
"Sophie?"
her
grandfather
spoke
from
the
doorway.
Startled,
she
spun,
dropping
the
key
on
the
floor
with
a
loud
clang.
She
stared
down
at
the
key,
afraid
to
look
up
at
her
grandfather's
face.
"I
was
looking
for
my
birthday
present,"
she
said,
hanging
her
head,
knowing
she
had
betrayed
his
trust.
For
what
seemed
like
an
eternity,
her
grandfather
stood
silently
in
the
doorway.
Finally,
he
let
out
a
long
troubled
breath.
"Pick
up
the
key,
Sophie."
Sophie
retrieved
the
key.
Her
grandfather
walked
in.
"Sophie,
you
need
to
respect
other
people's
privacy."
Gently,
he
knelt
down
and
took
the
key
from
her.
"This
key
is
very
special.
If
you
had
lost
it"
Her
grandfather's
quiet
voice
made
Sophie
feel
even
worse.
"I'm
sorry,
Grand
pere.
I
really
am."
She
paused.
"I
thought
it
was
a
necklace
for
my
birthday."
He
gazed
at
her
for
several
seconds.
"I'll
say
this
once
more,
Sophie,
because
it's
important.
You
need
to
learn
to
respect
other
people's
privacy."
"Yes,
Grand
pere.
"We'll
talk
about
this
some
other
time.
Right
now,
the
garden
needs
to
be
weeded."
Sophie
hurried
outside
to
do
her
chores.
The
next
morning,
Sophie
received
no
birthday
present
from
her
grandfather.
She
hadn't
expected
one,
not
after
what
she
had
done.
But
he
didn't
even
wish
her
happy
birthday
all
day.
Sadly,
she
trudged
up
to
bed
that
night.
As
she
climbed
in,
though,
she
found
a
note
card
lying
on
her
pillow.
On
the
card
was
written
a
simple
riddle.
Even
before
she
solved
the
riddle,
she
was
smiling.
know
what
this
is!
Her
grandfather
had
done
this
for
her
last
Christmas
morning.
A
treasure
hunt!
Eagerly,
she
pored
over
the
riddle
until
she
solved
it.
The
solution
pointed
her
to
another
part
of
the
house,
where
she
found
another
card
and
another
riddle.
She
solved
this
one
too,
racing
on
to
the
next
card.
Running
wildly,
she
darted
back
and
forth
across
the
house,
from
clue
to
clue,
until
at
last
she
found
a
clue
that
directed
her
back
to
her
own
bedroom.
Sophie
dashed
up
the
stairs,
rushed
into
her
room,
and
stopped
in
her
tracks.
There
in
the
middle
of
the
room
sat
a
shining
red
bicycle
with
a
ribbon
tied
to
the
handlebars.
Sophie
shrieked
with
delight.
"I
know
you
asked
for
a
doll,"
her
grandfather
said,
smiling
in
the
corner.
"I
thought
you
might
like
this
even
better."
The
next
day,
her
grandfather
taught
her
to
ride,
running
beside
her
down
the
walkway.
When
Sophie
steered
out
over
the
thick
lawn
and
lost
her
balance,
they
both
went
tumbling
onto
the
grass,
rolling
and
laughing.
"Grand
pere,
"
Sophie
said,
hugging
him.
"I'm
really
sorry
about
the
key."
"I
know,
sweetie.
You're
forgiven.
I
can't
possibly
stay
mad
at
you.
Grandfathers
and
granddaughters
always
forgive
each
other.
Sophie
knew
she
shouldn't
ask,
but
she
couldn't
help
it.
"What
does
it
open?
I
never
saw
a
key
like
that.
It
was
very
pretty."
Her
grandfather
was
silent
a
long
moment,
and
Sophie
could
see
he
was
uncertain
how
to
answer.
Grand
pere
never
lies.
"It
opens
a
box,"
he
finally
said.
"Where
I
keep
many
secrets."
Sophie
pouted.
"I
hate
secrets!"
"I
know,
but
these
are
important
secrets.
And
someday,
you'll
learn
to
appreciate
them
as
much
as
I
do."
"I
saw
letters
on
the
key,
and
a
flower."
"Yes,
that's
my
favorite
flower.
It's
called
a
fleur
de
lis.
We
have
them
in
the
garden.
The
white
ones.
In
English
we
call
that
kind
of
flower
a
lily."
"I
know
those!
They're
my
favorite
too!"
"Then
I'll
make
a
deal
with
you."
Her
grandfather's
eyebrows
raised
the
way
they
always
did
when
he
was
about
to
give
her
a
challenge.
"If
you
can
keep
my
key
a
secret,
and
never
talk
about
it
ever
again,
to
me
or
anybody,
then
someday
I
will
give
it
to
you."
Sophie
couldn't
believe
her
ears.
"You
will?"
"I
promise.
When
the
time
comes,
the
key
will
be
yours.
It
has
your
name
on
it."
Sophie
scowled.
"No
it
doesn't.
It
said
P.S.
My
name
isn't
P.S.!"
Her
grandfather
lowered
his
voice
and
looked
around
as
if
to
make
sure
no
one
was
listening.
"Okay,
Sophie,
if
you
must
know,
P.S.
is
a
code.
It's
your
secret
initials."
Her
eyes
went
wide.
"I
have
secret
initials?"
"Of
course.
Granddaughters
always
have
secret
initials
that
only
their
grandfathers
know."
"PS.?"
He
tickled
her.
"Princesse
Sophie.
She
giggled.
"I'm
not
a
princess!"
He
winked.
"You
are
to
me."
From
that
day
on,
they
never
again
spoke
of
the
key.
And
she
became
his
Princess
Sophie.
Inside
the
Salle
des
Etats,
Sophie
stood
in
silence
and
endured
the
sharp
pang
of
loss.
"The
initials,"
Langdon
whispered,
eyeing
her
strangely.
"Have
you
seen
them?"
Sophie
sensed
her
grandfather's
voice
whispering
in
the
corridors
of
the
museum.
Never
speak
of
this
key,
Sophie.
To
me
or
to
anyone.
She
knew
she
had
failed
him
in
forgiveness,
and
she
wondered
if
she
could
break
his
trust
again.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Her
grandfather
wanted
Langdon
to
help.
Sophie
nodded.
"Yes,
I
saw
the
initials
P.S.
once.
When
I
was
very
young."
"Where?"
Sophie
hesitated.
"On
something
very
important
to
him."
Langdon
locked
eyes
with
her.
"Sophie,
this
is
crucial.
Can
you
tell
me
if
the
initials
appeared
with
a
symbol?
A
fleur
de
lis?"
Sophie
felt
herself
staggering
backward
in
amazement.
"But
how
could
you
possibly
know
that!"
Langdon
exhaled
and
lowered
his
voice.
"I'm
fairly
certain
your
grandfather
was
a
member
of
a
secret
society.
A
very
old
covert
brotherhood."
Sophie
felt
a
knot
tighten
in
her
stomach.
She
was
certain
of
it
too.
For
ten
years
she
had
tried
to
forget
the
incident
that
had
confirmed
that
horrifying
fact
for
her.
She
had
witnessed
something
unthinkable.
Unforgivable.
"The
fleur
de
lis,"
Langdon
said,
"combined
with
the
initials
P.S.,
that
is
the
brotherhood's
official
device.
Their
coat
of
arms.
Their
logo."
"How
do
you
know
this?"
Sophie
was
praying
Langdon
was
not
going
to
tell
her
that
he
himself
was
a
member.
"I've
written
about
this
group,"
he
said,
his
voice
tremulous
with
excitement.
"Researching
the
symbols
of
secret
societies
is
a
specialty
of
mine.
They
call
themselves
the
Prieure
de
Sion
the
Priory
of
Sion.
They're
based
here
in
France
and
attract
powerful
members
from
all
over
Europe.
In
fact,
they
are
one
of
the
oldest
surviving
secret
societies
on
earth.
Sophie
had
never
heard
of
them.
Langdon
was
talking
in
rapid
bursts
now.
"The
Priory's
membership
has
included
some
of
history's
most
cultured
individuals:
men
like
Botticelli,
Sir
Isaac
Newton,
Victor
Hugo."
He
paused,
his
voice
brimming
now
with
academic
zeal.
"And,
Leonardo
da
Vinci."
Sophie
stared.
"Da
Vinci
was
in
a
secret
society?"
"Da
Vinci
presided
over
the
Priory
between
1510
and
1519
as
the
brotherhood's
Grand
Master,
which
might
help
explain
your
grandfather's
passion
for
Leonardo's
work.
The
two
men
share
a
historical
fraternal
bond.
And
it
all
fits
perfectly
with
their
fascination
for
goddess
iconology,
paganism,
feminine
deities,
and
contempt
for
the
Church.
The
Priory
has
a
well
documented
history
of
reverence
for
the
sacred
feminine."
"You're
telling
me
this
group
is
a
pagan
goddess
worship
cult?"
"More
like
the
pagan
goddess
worship
cult.
But
more
important,
they
are
known
as
the
guardians
of
an
ancient
secret.
One
that
made
them
immeasurably
powerful."
Despite
the
total
conviction
in
Langdon's
eyes,
Sophie's
gut
reaction
was
one
of
stark
disbelief.
A
secret
pagan
cult?
Once
headed
by
Leonardo
da
Vinci?
It
all
sounded
utterly
absurd.
And
yet,
even
as
she
dismissed
it,
she
felt
her
mind
reeling
back
ten
years
to
the
night
she
had
mistakenly
surprised
her
grandfather
and
witnessed
what
she
still
could
not
accept.
Could
that
explain
?
"The
identities
of
living
Priory
members
are
kept
extremely
secret,"
Langdon
said,
"but
the
P.S.
and
fleur
de
lis
that
you
saw
as
a
child
are
proof.
It
could
only
have
been
related
to
the
Priory."
Sophie
realized
now
that
Langdon
knew
far
more
about
her
grandfather
than
she
had
previously
imagined.
This
American
obviously
had
volumes
to
share
with
her,
but
this
was
not
the
place.
"I
can't
afford
to
let
them
catch
you,
Robert.
There's
a
lot
we
need
to
discuss.
You
need
to
go!"
Langdon
heard
only
the
faint
murmur
of
her
voice.
He
wasn't
going
anywhere.
He
was
lost
in
another
place
now.
A
place
where
ancient
secrets
rose
to
the
surface.
A
place
where
forgotten
histories
emerged
from
the
shadows.
Slowly,
as
if
moving
underwater,
Langdon
turned
his
head
and
gazed
through
the
reddish
haze
toward
the
Mona
Lisa.
The
fleur
de
lis
the
flower
of
Lisa
the
Mona
Lisa.
It
was
all
intertwined,
a
silent
symphony
echoing
the
deepest
secrets
of
the
Priory
of
Sion
and
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
A
few
miles
away,
on
the
riverbank
beyond
Les
Invalides,
the
bewildered
driver
of
a
twin
bed
Trailor
truck
stood
at
gunpoint
and
watched
as
the
captain
of
the
Judicial
Police
let
out
a
guttural
roar
of
rage
and
heaved
a
bar
of
soap
out
into
the
turgid
waters
of
the
Seine.
Silas
gazed
upward
at
the
Saint
Sulpice
obelisk,
taking
in
the
length
of
the
massive
marble
shaft.
His
sinews
felt
taut
with
exhilaration.
He
glanced
around
the
church
one
more
time
to
make
sure
he
was
alone.
Then
he
knelt
at
the
base
of
the
structure,
not
out
of
reverence,
but
out
of
necessity.
The
keystone
is
hidden
beneath
the
Rose
Line.
At
the
base
of
the
Sulpice
obelisk.
All
the
brothers
had
concurred.
On
his
knees
now,
Silas
ran
his
hands
across
the
stone
floor.
He
saw
no
cracks
or
markings
to
indicate
a
movable
tile,
so
he
began
rapping
softly
with
his
knuckles
on
the
floor.
Following
the
brass
line
closer
to
the
obelisk,
he
knocked
on
each
tile
adjacent
to
the
brass
line.
Finally,
one
of
them
echoed
strangely.
There's
a
hollow
area
beneath
the
floor!
Silas
smiled.
His
victims
had
spoken
the
truth.
Standing,
he
searched
the
sanctuary
for
something
with
which
to
break
the
floor
tile.
High
above
Silas,
in
the
balcony,
Sister
Sandrine
stifled
a
gasp.
Her
darkest
fears
had
just
been
confirmed.
This
visitor
was
not
who
he
seemed.
The
mysterious
Opus
Dei
monk
had
come
to
Saint
Sulpice
for
another
purpose.
A
secret
purpose.
You
are
not
the
only
one
with
secrets,
she
thought.
Sister
Sandrine
Bieil
was
more
than
the
keeper
of
this
church.
She
was
a
sentry.
And
tonight,
the
ancient
wheels
had
been
set
in
motion.
The
arrival
of
this
stranger
at
the
base
of
the
obelisk
was
a
signal
from
the
brotherhood.
It
was
a
silent
call
of
distress.
The
U.S.
Embassy
in
Paris
is
a
compact
complex
on
Avenue
Gabriel,
just
north
of
the
Champs
Elysees.
The
three
acre
compound
is
considered
U.S.
soil,
meaning
all
those
who
stand
on
it
are
subject
to
the
same
laws
and
protections
as
they
would
encounter
standing
in
the
United
States.
The
embassy's
night
operator
was
reading
Time
magazine's
International
Edition
when
the
sound
of
her
phone
interrupted.
"U.S.
Embassy,"
she
answered.
"Good
evening."
The
caller
spoke
English
accented
with
French.
"I
need
some
assistance."
Despite
the
politeness
of
the
man's
words,
his
tone
sounded
gruff
and
official.
"I
was
told
you
had
a
phone
message
for
me
on
your
automated
system.
The
name
is
Langdon.
Unfortunately,
I
have
forgotten
my
three
digit
access
code.
If
you
could
help
me,
I
would
be
most
grateful."
The
operator
paused,
confused.
"I'm
sorry,
sir.
Your
message
must
be
quite
old.
That
system
was
removed
two
years
ago
for
security
precautions.
Moreover,
all
the
access
codes
were
five
digit.
Who
told
you
we
had
a
message
for
you?"
"You
have
no
automated
phone
system?"
"No,
sir.
Any
message
for
you
would
be
handwritten
in
our
services
department.
What
was
your
name
again?"
But
the
man
had
hung
up.
Bezu
Fache
felt
dumbstruck
as
he
paced
the
banks
of
the
Seine.
He
was
certain
he
had
seen
Langdon
dial
a
local
number,
enter
a
three
digit
code,
and
then
listen
to
a
recording.
But
if
Langdon
didn't
phone
the
embassy,
then
who
the
hell
did
he
call?
It
was
at
that
moment,
eyeing
his
cellular
phone,
that
Fache
realized
the
answers
were
in
the
palm
of
his
hand.
Langdon
used
my
phone
to
place
that
call.
Keying
into
the
cell
phone's
menu,
Fache
pulled
up
the
list
of
recently
dialed
numbers
and
found
the
call
Langdon
had
placed.
A
Paris
exchange,
followed
by
the
three
digit
code
454.
Redialing
the
phone
number,
Fache
waited
as
the
line
began
ringing.
Finally
a
woman's
voice
answered.
"Bonjour,
vous
etes
bien
chez
Sophie
Neveu,
"
the
recording
announced.
"Je
suis
absente
pour
le
moment,
mais"
Fache's
blood
was
boiling
as
he
typed
the
numbers
4
5
4.
Despite
her
monumental
reputation,
the
Mona
Lisa
was
a
mere
thirty
one
inches
by
twenty
one
inches
smaller
even
than
the
posters
of
her
sold
in
the
Louvre
gift
shop.
She
hung
on
the
northwest
wall
of
the
Salle
des
Etats
behind
a
two
inch
thick
pane
of
protective
Plexiglas.
Painted
on
a
poplar
wood
panel,
her
ethereal,
mist
filled
atmosphere
was
attributed
to
Da
Vinci's
mastery
of
the
sfumato
style,
in
which
forms
appear
to
evaporate
into
one
another.
Since
taking
up
residence
in
the
Louvre,
the
Mona
Lisa
or
La
Jaconde
as
they
call
her
in
France
had
been
stolen
twice,
most
recently
in
1911,
when
she
disappeared
from
the
Louvre's
"satte
impenetrable"
Le
Salon
Carre.
Parisians
wept
in
the
streets
and
wrote
newspaper
articles
begging
the
thieves
for
the
painting's
return.
Two
years
later,
the
Mona
Lisa
was
discovered
hidden
in
the
false
bottom
of
a
trunk
in
a
Florence
hotel
room.
Langdon,
now
having
made
it
clear
to
Sophie
that
he
had
no
intention
of
leaving,
moved
with
her
across
the
Salle
des
Etats.
The
Mona
Lisa
was
still
twenty
yards
ahead
when
Sophie
turned
on
the
black
light,
and
the
bluish
crescent
of
penlight
fanned
out
on
the
floor
in
front
of
them.
She
swung
the
beam
back
and
forth
across
the
floor
like
a
minesweeper,
searching
for
any
hint
of
luminescent
ink.
Walking
beside
her,
Langdon
was
already
feeling
the
tingle
of
anticipation
that
accompanied
his
face
to
face
reunions
with
great
works
of
art.
He
strained
to
see
beyond
the
cocoon
of
purplish
light
emanating
from
the
black
light
in
Sophie's
hand.
To
the
left,
the
room's
octagonal
viewing
divan
emerged,
looking
like
a
dark
island
on
the
empty
sea
of
parquet.
Langdon
could
now
begin
to
see
the
panel
of
dark
glass
on
the
wall.
Behind
it,
he
knew,
in
the
confines
of
her
own
private
cell,
hung
the
most
celebrated
painting
in
the
world.
The
Mona
Lisa
's
status
as
the
most
famous
piece
of
art
in
the
world,
Langdon
knew,
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
enigmatic
smile.
Nor
was
it
due
to
the
mysterious
interpretations
attributed
her
by
many
art
historians
and
conspiracy
buffs.
Quite
simply,
the
Mona
Lisa
was
famous
because
Leonardo
da
Vinci
claimed
she
was
his
finest
accomplishment.
He
carried
the
painting
with
him
whenever
he
traveled
and,
if
asked
why,
would
reply
that
he
found
it
hard
to
part
with
his
most
sublime
expression
of
female
beauty.
Even
so,
many
art
historians
suspected
Da
Vinci's
reverence
for
the
Mona
Lisa
had
nothing
to
do
with
its
artistic
mastery.
In
actuality,
the
painting
was
a
surprisingly
ordinary
sfumato
portrait.
Da
Vinci's
veneration
for
this
work,
many
claimed,
stemmed
from
something
far
deeper:
a
hidden
message
in
the
layers
of
paint.
The
Mona
Lisa
was,
in
fact,
one
of
the
world's
most
documented
inside
jokes.
The
painting's
well
documented
collage
of
double
entendres
and
playful
allusions
had
been
revealed
in
most
art
history
tomes,
and
yet,
incredibly,
the
public
at
large
still
considered
her
smile
a
great
mystery.
No
mystery
at
all,
Langdon
thought,
moving
forward
and
watching
as
the
faint
outline
of
the
painting
began
to
take
shape.
No
mystery
at
all.
Most
recently
Langdon
had
shared
the
Mona
Lisa
's
secret
with
a
rather
unlikely
group
a
dozen
inmates
at
the
Essex
County
Penitentiary.
Langdon's
jail
seminar
was
part
of
a
Harvard
outreach
program
attempting
to
bring
education
into
the
prison
system
Culture
for
Convicts,
as
Langdon's
colleagues
liked
to
call
it.
Standing
at
an
overhead
projector
in
a
darkened
penitentiary
library,
Langdon
had
shared
the
Mona
Lisa's
secret
with
the
prisoners
attending
class,
men
whom
he
found
surprisingly
engaged
rough,
but
sharp.
"You
may
notice,"
Langdon
told
them,
walking
up
to
the
projected
image
of
the
Mona
Lisa
on
the
library
wall,
"that
the
background
behind
her
face
is
uneven."
Langdon
motioned
to
the
glaring
discrepancy.
"Da
Vinci
painted
the
horizon
line
on
the
left
significantly
lower
than
the
right."
"He
screwed
it
up?"
one
of
the
inmates
asked.
Langdon
chuckled.
"No.
Da
Vinci
didn't
do
that
too
often.
Actually,
this
is
a
little
trick
Da
Vinci
played.
By
lowering
the
countryside
on
the
left,
Da
Vinci
made
Mona
Lisa
look
much
larger
from
the
left
side
than
from
the
right
side.
A
little
Da
Vinci
inside
joke.
Historically,
the
concepts
of
male
and
female
have
assigned
sides
left
is
female,
and
right
is
male.
Because
Da
Vinci
was
a
big
fan
of
feminine
principles,
he
made
Mona
Lisa
look
more
majestic
from
the
left
than
the
right."
"I
heard
he
was
a
fag,"
said
a
small
man
with
a
goatee.
Langdon
winced.
"Historians
don't
generally
put
it
quite
that
way,
but
yes,
Da
Vinci
was
a
homosexual."
"Is
that
why
he
was
into
that
whole
feminine
thing?"
"Actually,
Da
Vinci
was
in
tune
with
the
balance
between
male
and
female.
He
believed
that
a
human
soul
could
not
be
enlightened
unless
it
had
both
male
and
female
elements."
"You
mean
like
chicks
with
dicks?"
someone
called.
This
elicited
a
hearty
round
of
laughs.
Langdon
considered
offering
an
etymological
sidebar
about
the
word
hermaphrodite
and
its
ties
to
Hermes
and
Aphrodite,
but
something
told
him
it
would
be
lost
on
this
crowd.
"Hey,
Mr.
Langford,"
a
muscle
bound
man
said.
"Is
it
true
that
the
Mona
Lisa
is
a
picture
of
Da
Vinci
in
drag?
I
heard
that
was
true."
"It's
quite
possible,"
Langdon
said.
"Da
Vinci
was
a
prankster,
and
computerized
analysis
of
the
Mona
Lisa
and
Da
Vinci's
self
portraits
confirm
some
startling
points
of
congruency
in
their
faces.
Whatever
Da
Vinci
was
up
to,"
Langdon
said,
"his
Mona
Lisa
is
neither
male
nor
female.
It
carries
a
subtle
message
of
androgyny.
It
is
a
fusing
of
both."
"You
sure
that's
not
just
some
Harvard
bullshit
way
of
saying
Mona
Lisa
is
one
ugly
chick."
Now
Langdon
laughed.
"You
may
be
right.
But
actually
Da
Vinci
left
a
big
clue
that
the
painting
was
supposed
to
be
androgynous.
Has
anyone
here
ever
heard
of
an
Egyptian
god
named
Anion?"
"Hell
yes!"
the
big
guy
said.
"God
of
masculine
fertility!"
Langdon
was
stunned.
"It
says
so
on
every
box
of
Amon
condoms."
The
muscular
man
gave
a
wide
grin.
"It's
got
a
guy
with
a
ram's
head
on
the
front
and
says
he's
the
Egyptian
god
of
fertility."
Langdon
was
not
familiar
with
the
brand
name,
but
he
was
glad
to
hear
the
prophylactic
manufacturers
had
gotten
their
hieroglyphs
right.
"Well
done.
Amon
is
indeed
represented
as
a
man
with
a
ram's
head,
and
his
promiscuity
and
curved
horns
are
related
to
our
modern
sexual
slang
'horny.'
"No
shit!"
"No
shit,"
Langdon
said.
"And
do
you
know
who
Amon's
counterpart
was?
The
Egyptian
goddess
of
fertility?"
The
question
met
with
several
seconds
of
silence.
"It
was
Isis,"
Langdon
told
them,
grabbing
a
grease
pen.
"So
we
have
the
male
god,
Amon."
He
wrote
it
down.
"And
the
female
goddess,
Isis,
whose
ancient
pictogram
was
once
called
L'ISA."
Langdon
finished
writing
and
stepped
back
from
the
projector.
AMON
L'ISA
"Ring
any
bells?"
he
asked.
"Mona
Lisa
holy
crap,"
somebody
gasped.
Langdon
nodded.
"Gentlemen,
not
only
does
the
face
of
Mona
Lisa
look
androgynous,
but
her
name
is
an
anagram
of
the
divine
union
of
male
and
female.
And
that,
my
friends,
is
Da
Vinci's
little
secret,
and
the
reason
for
Mona
Lisa's
knowing
smile."
"My
grandfather
was
here,"
Sophie
said,
dropping
suddenly
to
her
knees,
now
only
ten
feet
from
the
Mona
Lisa.
She
pointed
the
black
light
tentatively
to
a
spot
on
the
parquet
floor.
At
first
Langdon
saw
nothing.
Then,
as
he
knelt
beside
her,
he
saw
a
tiny
droplet
of
dried
liquid
that
was
luminescing.
Ink?
Suddenly
he
recalled
what
black
lights
were
actually
used
for.
Blood.
His
senses
tingled.
Sophie
was
right.
Jacques
Sauniere
had
indeed
paid
a
visit
to
the
Mona
Lisa
before
he
died.
"He
wouldn't
have
come
here
without
a
reason,"
Sophie
whispered,
standing
up.
"I
know
he
left
a
message
for
me
here."
Quickly
striding
the
final
few
steps
to
the
Mona
Lisa,
she
illuminated
the
floor
directly
in
front
of
the
painting.
She
waved
the
light
back
and
forth
across
the
bare
parquet.
"There's
nothing
here!"
At
that
moment,
Langdon
saw
a
faint
purple
glimmer
on
the
protective
glass
before
the
Mona
Lisa.
Reaching
down,
he
took
Sophie's
wrist
and
slowly
moved
the
light
up
to
the
painting
itself.
They
both
froze.
On
the
glass,
six
words
glowed
in
purple,
scrawled
directly
across
the
Mona
Lisa's
face.
Seated
at
Sauniere's
desk,
Lieutenant
Collet
pressed
the
phone
to
his
ear
in
disbelief.
Did
I
hear
Fache
correctly?
"A
bar
of
soap?
But
how
could
Langdon
have
known
about
the
GPS
dot?"
"Sophie
Neveu,"
Fache
replied.
"She
told
him."
"What!
Why?"
"Damned
good
question,
but
I
just
heard
a
recording
that
confirms
she
tipped
him
off."
Collet
was
speechless.
What
was
Neveu
thinking?
Fache
had
proof
that
Sophie
had
interfered
with
a
DCPJ
sting
operation?
Sophie
Neveu
was
not
only
going
to
be
fired,
she
was
also
going
to
jail.
"But,
Captain
then
where
is
Langdon
now?"
"Have
any
fire
alarms
gone
off
there?"
"No,
sir."
"And
no
one
has
come
out
under
the
Grand
Gallery
gate?"
"No.
We've
got
a
Louvre
security
officer
on
the
gate.
Just
as
you
requested."
"Okay,
Langdon
must
still
be
inside
the
Grand
Gallery."
"Inside?
But
what
is
he
doing?"
"Is
the
Louvre
security
guard
armed?"
"Yes,
sir.
He's
a
senior
warden."
"Send
him
in,"
Fache
commanded.
"I
can't
get
my
men
back
to
the
perimeter
for
a
few
minutes,
and
I
don't
want
Langdon
breaking
for
an
exit."
Fache
paused.
"And
you'd
better
tell
the
guard
Agent
Neveu
is
probably
in
there
with
him."
"Agent
Neveu
left,
I
thought."
"Did
you
actually
see
her
leave?"
"No,
sir,
but"
"Well,
nobody
on
the
perimeter
saw
her
leave
either.
They
only
saw
her
go
in."
Collet
was
flabbergasted
by
Sophie
Neveu's
bravado.
She's
still
inside
the
building?
"Handle
it,"
Fache
ordered.
"I
want
Langdon
and
Neveu
at
gunpoint
by
the
time
I
get
back."
As
the
Trailor
truck
drove
off,
Captain
Fache
rounded
up
his
men.
Robert
Langdon
had
proven
an
elusive
quarry
tonight,
and
with
Agent
Neveu
now
helping
him,
he
might
be
far
harder
to
corner
than
expected.
Fache
decided
not
to
take
any
chances.
Hedging
his
bets,
he
ordered
half
of
his
men
back
to
the
Louvre
perimeter.
The
other
half
he
sent
to
guard
the
only
location
in
Paris
where
Robert
Langdon
could
find
safe
harbor.
Inside
the
Salle
des
Etats,
Langdon
stared
in
astonishment
at
the
six
words
glowing
on
the
Plexiglas.
The
text
seemed
to
hover
in
space,
casting
a
jagged
shadow
across
Mona
Lisa's
mysterious
smile.
"The
Priory,"
Langdon
whispered.
"This
proves
your
grandfather
was
a
member!"
Sophie
looked
at
him
in
confusion.
"You
understand
this?"
"It's
flawless,"
Langdon
said,
nodding
as
his
thoughts
churned.
"It's
a
proclamation
of
one
of
the
Priory's
most
fundamental
philosophies!"
Sophie
looked
baffled
in
the
glow
of
the
message
scrawled
across
the
Mona
Lisa's
face.
SO
DARK
THE
CON
OF
MAN
"Sophie,"
Langdon
said,
"the
Priory's
tradition
of
perpetuating
goddess
worship
is
based
on
a
belief
that
powerful
men
in
the
early
Christian
church
'conned'
the
world
by
propagating
lies
that
devalued
the
female
and
tipped
the
scales
in
favor
of
the
masculine."
Sophie
remained
silent,
staring
at
the
words.
"The
Priory
believes
that
Constantine
and
his
male
successors
successfully
converted
the
world
from
matriarchal
paganism
to
patriarchal
Christianity
by
waging
a
campaign
of
propaganda
that
demonized
the
sacred
feminine,
obliterating
the
goddess
from
modern
religion
forever."
Sophie's
expression
remained
uncertain.
"My
grandfather
sent
me
to
this
spot
to
find
this.
He
must
be
trying
to
tell
me
more
than
that.
Langdon
understood
her
meaning.
She
thinks
this
is
another
code.
Whether
a
hidden
meaning
existed
here
or
not,
Langdon
could
not
immediately
say.
His
mind
was
still
grappling
with
the
bold
clarity
of
Sauniere's
outward
message.
So
dark
the
con
of
man,
he
thought.
So
dark
indeed.
Nobody
could
deny
the
enormous
good
the
modern
Church
did
in
today's
troubled
world,
and
yet
the
Church
had
a
deceitful
and
violent
history.
Their
brutal
crusade
to
"reeducate"
the
pagan
and
feminine
worshipping
religions
spanned
three
centuries,
employing
methods
as
inspired
as
they
were
horrific.
The
Catholic
Inquisition
published
the
book
that
arguably
could
be
called
the
most
blood
soaked
publication
in
human
history.
Malleus
Maleficarum
or
The
Witches'
Hammer
indoctrinated
the
world
to
"the
dangers
of
freethinking
women"
and
instructed
the
clergy
how
to
locate,
torture,
and
destroy
them.
Those
deemed
"witches"
by
the
Church
included
all
female
scholars,
priestesses,
gypsies,
mystics,
nature
lovers,
herb
gatherers,
and
any
women
"suspiciously
attuned
to
the
natural
world.
"
Midwives
also
were
killed
for
their
heretical
practice
of
using
medical
knowledge
to
ease
the
pain
of
childbirth
a
suffering,
the
Church
claimed,
that
was
God's
rightful
punishment
for
Eve's
partaking
of
the
Apple
of
Knowledge,
thus
giving
birth
to
the
idea
of
Original
Sin.
During
three
hundred
years
of
witch
hunts,
the
Church
burned
at
the
stake
an
astounding
five
million
women.
The
propaganda
and
bloodshed
had
worked.
Today's
world
was
living
proof.
Women,
once
celebrated
as
an
essential
half
of
spiritual
enlightenment,
had
been
banished
from
the
temples
of
the
world.
There
were
no
female
Orthodox
rabbis,
Catholic
priests,
nor
Islamic
clerics.
The
once
hallowed
act
of
Hieros
Gamos
the
natural
sexual
union
between
man
and
woman
through
which
each
became
spiritually
whole
had
been
recast
as
a
shameful
act.
Holy
men
who
had
once
required
sexual
union
with
their
female
counterparts
to
commune
with
God
now
feared
their
natural
sexual
urges
as
the
work
of
the
devil,
collaborating
with
his
favorite
accomplice
woman.
Not
even
the
feminine
association
with
the
left
hand
side
could
escape
the
Church's
defamation.
In
France
and
Italy,
the
words
for
"left"
gauche
and
sinistra
came
to
have
deeply
negative
overtones,
while
their
right
hand
counterparts
rang
of
ngz?eousness,
dexterity,
and
correctness.
To
this
day,
radical
thought
was
considered
left
wing,
irrational
thought
was
left
brain,
and
anything
evil,
sinister.
The
days
of
the
goddess
were
over.
The
pendulum
had
swung.
Mother
Earth
had
become
a
man's
world,
and
the
gods
of
destruction
and
war
were
taking
their
toll.
The
male
ego
had
spent
two
millennia
running
unchecked
by
its
female
counterpart.
The
Priory
of
Sion
believed
that
it
was
this
obliteration
of
the
sacred
feminine
in
modern
life
that
had
caused
what
the
Hopi
Native
Americans
called
koyanisquatsi
"life
out
of
balance"
an
unstable
situation
marked
by
testosterone
fueled
wars,
a
plethora
of
misogynistic
societies,
and
a
growing
disrespect
for
Mother
Earth.
"Robert!"
Sophie
said,
her
whisper
yanking
him
back.
"Someone's
coming!"
He
heard
the
approaching
footsteps
out
in
the
hallway.
"Over
here!"
Sophie
extinguished
the
black
light
and
seemed
to
evaporate
before
Langdon's
eyes.
For
an
instant
he
felt
totally
blind.
Over
where!
As
his
vision
cleared
he
saw
Sophie's
silhouette
racing
toward
the
center
of
the
room
and
ducking
out
of
sight
behind
the
octagonal
viewing
bench.
He
was
about
to
dash
after
her
when
a
booming
voice
stopped
him
cold.
"Arretez!"
a
man
commanded
from
the
doorway.
The
Louvre
security
agent
advanced
through
the
entrance
to
the
Salle
des
Etats,
his
pistol
outstretched,
taking
deadly
aim
at
Langdon's
chest.
Langdon
felt
his
arms
raise
instinctively
for
the
ceiling.
"Couchez
vous!"
the
guard
commanded.
"Lie
down!"
Langdon
was
face
first
on
the
floor
in
a
matter
of
seconds.
The
guard
hurried
over
and
kicked
his
legs
apart,
spreading
Langdon
out.
"Mauvaise
idee,
Monsieur
Langdon,
"
he
said,
pressing
the
gun
hard
into
Langdon's
back.
"Mauvaise
idee.
Face
down
on
the
parquet
floor
with
his
arms
and
legs
spread
wide,
Langdon
found
little
humor
in
the
irony
of
his
position.
The
Vitruvian
Man,
he
thought.
Face
down.
Inside
Saint
Sulpice,
Silas
carried
the
heavy
iron
votive
candle
holder
from
the
altar
back
toward
the
obelisk.
The
shaft
would
do
nicely
as
a
battering
ram.
Eyeing
the
gray
marble
panel
that
covered
the
apparent
hollow
in
the
floor,
he
realized
he
could
not
possibly
shatter
the
covering
without
making
considerable
noise.
Iron
on
marble.
It
would
echo
off
the
vaulted
ceilings.
Would
the
nun
hear
him?
She
should
be
asleep
by
now.
Even
so,
it
was
a
chance
Silas
preferred
not
to
take.
Looking
around
for
a
cloth
to
wrap
around
the
tip
of
the
iron
pole,
he
saw
nothing
except
the
altar's
linen
mantle,
which
he
refused
to
defile.
My
cloak,
he
thought.
Knowing
he
was
alone
in
the
great
church,
Silas
untied
his
cloak
and
slipped
it
off
his
body.
As
he
removed
it,
he
felt
a
sting
as
the
wool
fibers
stuck
to
the
fresh
wounds
on
his
back.
Naked
now,
except
for
his
loin
swaddle,
Silas
wrapped
his
cloak
over
the
end
of
the
iron
rod.
Then,
aiming
at
the
center
of
the
floor
tile,
he
drove
the
tip
into
it.
A
muffled
thud.
The
stone
did
not
break.
He
drove
the
pole
into
it
again.
Again
a
dull
thud,
but
this
time
accompanied
by
a
crack.
On
the
third
swing,
the
covering
finally
shattered,
and
stone
shards
fell
into
a
hollow
area
beneath
the
floor.
A
compartment!
Quickly
pulling
the
remaining
pieces
from
the
opening,
Silas
gazed
into
the
void.
His
blood
pounded
as
he
knelt
down
before
it.
Raising
his
pale
bare
arm,
he
reached
inside.
At
first
he
felt
nothing.
The
floor
of
the
compartment
was
bare,
smooth
stone.
Then,
feeling
deeper,
reaching
his
arm
in
under
the
Rose
Line,
he
touched
something!
A
thick
stone
tablet.
Getting
his
fingers
around
the
edge,
he
gripped
it
and
gently
lifted
the
tablet
out.
As
he
stood
and
examined
his
find,
he
realized
he
was
holding
a
rough
hewn
stone
slab
with
engraved
words.
He
felt
for
an
instant
like
a
modern
day
Moses.
As
Silas
read
the
words
on
the
tablet,
he
felt
surprise.
He
had
expected
the
keystone
to
be
a
map,
or
a
complex
series
of
directions,
perhaps
even
encoded.
The
keystone,
however,
bore
the
simplest
of
inscriptions.
Job
38:11
A
Bible
verse
?
Silas
was
stunned
with
the
devilish
simplicity.
The
secret
location
of
that
which
they
sought
was
revealed
in
a
Bible
verse?
The
brotherhood
stopped
at
nothing
to
mock
the
righteous!
Job.
Chapter
thirty
eight.
Verse
eleven.
Although
Silas
did
not
recall
the
exact
contents
of
verse
eleven
by
heart,
he
knew
the
Book
of
Job
told
the
story
of
a
man
whose
faith
in
God
survived
repeated
tests.
Appropriate,
he
thought,
barely
able
to
contain
his
excitement.
Looking
over
his
shoulder,
he
gazed
down
the
shimmering
Rose
Line
and
couldn't
help
but
smile.
There
atop
the
main
altar,
propped
open
on
a
gilded
book
stand,
sat
an
enormous
leather
bound
Bible.
Up
in
the
balcony,
Sister
Sandrine
was
shaking.
Moments
ago,
she
had
been
about
to
flee
and
carry
out
her
orders,
when
the
man
below
suddenly
removed
his
cloak.
When
she
saw
his
alabaster
white
flesh,
she
was
overcome
with
a
horrified
bewilderment.
His
broad,
pale
back
was
soaked
with
blood
red
slashes.
Even
from
here
she
could
see
the
wounds
were
fresh.
This
man
has
been
mercilessly
whipped!
She
also
saw
the
bloody
cilice
around
his
thigh,
the
wound
beneath
it
dripping.
What
kind
of
God
would
want
a
body
punished
this
way?
The
rituals
of
Opus
Dei,
Sister
Sandrine
knew,
were
not
something
she
would
ever
understand.
But
that
was
hardly
her
concern
at
this
instant.
Opus
Dei
is
searching
for
the
keystone.
How
they
knew
of
it,
Sister
Sandrine
could
not
imagine,
although
she
knew
she
did
not
have
time
to
think.
The
bloody
monk
was
now
quietly
donning
his
cloak
again,
clutching
his
prize
as
he
moved
toward
the
altar,
toward
the
Bible.
In
breathless
silence,
Sister
Sandrine
left
the
balcony
and
raced
down
the
hall
to
her
quarters.
Getting
on
her
hands
and
knees,
she
reached
beneath
her
wooden
bed
frame
and
retrieved
the
sealed
envelope
she
had
hidden
there
years
ago.
Tearing
it
open,
she
found
four
Paris
phone
numbers.
Trembling,
she
began
to
dial.
Downstairs,
Silas
laid
the
stone
tablet
on
the
altar
and
turned
his
eager
hands
to
the
leather
Bible.
His
long
white
fingers
were
sweating
now
as
he
turned
the
pages.
Flipping
through
the
Old
Testament,
he
found
the
Book
of
Job.
He
located
chapter
thirty
eight.
As
he
ran
his
finger
down
the
column
of
text,
he
anticipated
the
words
he
was
about
to
read.
They
will
lead
the
way!
Finding
verse
number
eleven,
Silas
read
the
text.
It
was
only
seven
words.
Confused,
he
read
it
again,
sensing
something
had
gone
terribly
wrong.
The
verse
simply
read:
HITHERTO
SHALT
THOU
COME,
BUT
NO
FURTHER.
Security
warden
Claude
Grouard
simmered
with
rage
as
he
stood
over
his
prostrate
captive
in
front
of
the
Mona
Lisa.
This
bastard
killed
Jacques
Sauniere!
Sauniere
had
been
like
a
well
loved
father
to
Grouard
and
his
security
team.
Grouard
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
pull
the
trigger
and
bury
a
bullet
in
Robert
Langdon's
back.
As
senior
warden,
Grouard
was
one
of
the
few
guards
who
actually
carried
a
loaded
weapon.
He
reminded
himself,
however,
that
killing
Langdon
would
be
a
generous
fate
compared
to
the
misery
about
to
be
communicated
by
Bezu
Fache
and
the
French
prison
system.
Grouard
yanked
his
walkie
talkie
off
his
belt
and
attempted
to
radio
for
backup.
All
he
heard
was
static.
The
additional
electronic
security
in
this
chamber
always
wrought
havoc
with
the
guards'
communications.
have
to
move
to
the
doorway.
Still
aiming
his
weapon
at
Langdon,
Grouard
began
backing
slowly
toward
the
entrance.
On
his
third
step,
he
spied
something
that
made
him
stop
short.
What
the
hell
is
that!
An
inexplicable
mirage
was
materializing
near
the
center
of
the
room.
A
silhouette.
There
was
someone
else
in
the
room?
A
woman
was
moving
through
the
darkness,
walking
briskly
toward
the
far
left
wall.
In
front
of
her,
a
purplish
beam
of
light
swung
back
and
forth
across
the
floor,
as
if
she
were
searching
for
something
with
a
colored
flashlight.
"Qui
est
la
?
"
Grouard
demanded,
feeling
his
adrenaline
spike
for
a
second
time
in
the
last
thirty
seconds.
He
suddenly
didn't
know
where
to
aim
his
gun
or
what
direction
to
move.
"PTS,"
the
woman
replied
calmly,
still
scanning
the
floor
with
her
light.
Police
Technique
et
Scientifique.
Grouard
was
sweating
now.
thought
all
the
agents
were
gone!
He
now
recognized
the
purple
light
as
ultraviolet,
consistent
with
a
PTS
team,
and
yet
he
could
not
understand
why
DCPJ
would
be
looking
for
evidence
in
here.
"Votre
nom!"
Grouard
yelled,
instinct
telling
him
something
was
amiss.
"Repondez!"
"C'est
mot,"
the
voice
responded
in
calm
French.
"Sophie
Neveu.
Somewhere
in
the
distant
recesses
of
Grouard's
mind,
the
name
registered.
Sophie
Neveu?
That
was
the
name
of
Sauniere's
granddaughter,
wasn't
it?
She
used
to
come
in
here
as
a
little
kid,
but
that
was
years
ago.
This
couldn't
possibly
be
her!
And
even
if
it
were
Sophie
Neveu,
that
was
hardly
a
reason
to
trust
her;
Grouard
had
heard
the
rumors
of
the
painful
falling
out
between
Sauniere
and
his
granddaughter.
"You
know
me,"
the
woman
called.
"And
Robert
Langdon
did
not
kill
my
grandfather.
Believe
me."
Warden
Grouard
was
not
about
to
take
that
on
faith.
need
backup!
Trying
his
walkie
talkie
again,
he
got
only
static.
The
entrance
was
still
a
good
twenty
yards
behind
him,
and
Grouard
began
backing
up
slowly,
choosing
to
leave
his
gun
trained
on
the
man
on
the
floor.
As
Grouard
inched
backward,
he
could
see
the
woman
across
the
room
raising
her
UV
light
and
scrutinizing
a
large
painting
that
hung
on
the
far
side
of
the
Salle
des
Etats,
directly
opposite
the
Mona
Lisa.
Grouard
gasped,
realizing
which
painting
it
was.
What
in
the
name
of
God
is
she
doing?
Across
the
room,
Sophie
Neveu
felt
a
cold
sweat
breaking
across
her
forehead.
Langdon
was
still
spread
eagle
on
the
floor.
Hold
on,
Robert.
Almost
there.
Knowing
the
guard
would
never
actually
shoot
either
of
them,
Sophie
now
turned
her
attention
back
to
the
matter
at
hand,
scanning
the
entire
area
around
one
masterpiece
in
particular
another
Da
Vinci.
But
the
UV
light
revealed
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary.
Not
on
the
floor,
on
the
walls,
or
even
on
the
canvas
itself.
There
must
be
something
here!
Sophie
felt
totally
certain
she
had
deciphered
her
grandfather's
intentions
correctly.
What
else
could
he
possibly
intend?
The
masterpiece
she
was
examining
was
a
five
foot
tall
canvas.
The
bizarre
scene
Da
Vinci
had
painted
included
an
awkwardly
posed
Virgin
Mary
sitting
with
Baby
Jesus,
John
the
Baptist,
and
the
Angel
Uriel
on
a
perilous
outcropping
of
rocks.
When
Sophie
was
a
little
girl,
no
trip
to
the
Mona
Lisa
had
been
complete
without
her
grandfather
dragging
her
across
the
room
to
see
this
second
painting.
Grand
pere,
I'm
here!
But
I
don
't
see
it!
Behind
her,
Sophie
could
hear
the
guard
trying
to
radio
again
for
help.
Think!
She
pictured
the
message
scrawled
on
the
protective
glass
of
the
Mona
Lisa.
So
dark
the
con
of
man.
The
painting
before
her
had
no
protective
glass
on
which
to
write
a
message,
and
Sophie
knew
her
grandfather
would
never
have
defaced
this
masterpiece
by
writing
on
the
painting
itself.
She
paused.
At
least
not
on
the
front.
Her
eyes
shot
upward,
climbing
the
long
cables
that
dangled
from
the
ceiling
to
support
the
canvas.
Could
that
be
it?
Grabbing
the
left
side
of
the
carved
wood
frame,
she
pulled
it
toward
her.
The
painting
was
large
and
the
backing
flexed
as
she
swung
it
away
from
the
wall.
Sophie
slipped
her
head
and
shoulders
in
behind
the
painting
and
raised
the
black
light
to
inspect
the
back.
It
took
only
seconds
to
realize
her
instinct
had
been
wrong.
The
back
of
the
painting
was
pale
and
blank.
There
was
no
purple
text
here,
only
the
mottled
brown
backside
of
aging
canvas
and
Wait.
Sophie's
eyes
locked
on
an
incongruous
glint
of
lustrous
metal
lodged
near
the
bottom
edge
of
the
frame's
wooden
armature.
The
object
was
small,
partially
wedged
in
the
slit
where
the
canvas
met
the
frame.
A
shimmering
gold
chain
dangled
off
it.
To
Sophie's
utter
amazement,
the
chain
was
affixed
to
a
familiar
gold
key.
The
broad,
sculpted
head
was
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
and
bore
an
engraved
seal
she
had
not
seen
since
she
was
nine
years
old.
A
fleur
de
lis
with
the
initials
P.S.
In
that
instant,
Sophie
felt
the
ghost
of
her
grandfather
whispering
in
her
ear.
When
the
time
comes,
the
key
will
be
yours.
A
tightness
gripped
her
throat
as
she
realized
that
her
grandfather,
even
in
death,
had
kept
his
promise.
This
key
opens
a
box,
his
voice
was
saying,
where
I
keep
many
secrets.
Sophie
now
realized
that
the
entire
purpose
of
tonight's
word
game
had
been
this
key.
Her
grandfather
had
it
with
him
when
he
was
killed.
Not
wanting
it
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
police,
he
hid
it
behind
this
painting.
Then
he
devised
an
ingenious
treasure
hunt
to
ensure
only
Sophie
would
find
it.
"Au
secours!"
the
guard's
voice
yelled.
Sophie
snatched
the
key
from
behind
the
painting
and
slipped
it
deep
in
her
pocket
along
with
the
UV
penlight.
Peering
out
from
behind
the
canvas,
she
could
see
the
guard
was
still
trying
desperately
to
raise
someone
on
the
walkie
talkie.
He
was
backing
toward
the
entrance,
still
aiming
the
gun
firmly
at
Langdon.
"Au
secours!"
he
shouted
again
into
his
radio.
Static.
He
can
't
transmit,
Sophie
realized,
recalling
that
tourists
with
cell
phones
often
got
frustrated
in
here
when
they
tried
to
call
home
to
brag
about
seeing
the
Mona
Lisa.
The
extra
surveillance
wiring
in
the
walls
made
it
virtually
impossible
to
get
a
carrier
unless
you
stepped
out
into
the
hall.
The
guard
was
backing
quickly
toward
the
exit
now,
and
Sophie
knew
she
had
to
act
immediately.
Gazing
up
at
the
large
painting
behind
which
she
was
partially
ensconced,
Sophie
realized
that
Leonardo
da
Vinci,
for
the
second
time
tonight,
was
there
to
help.
Another
few
meters,
Grouard
told
himself,
keeping
his
gun
leveled.
"Arretez!
Ouje
la
detruis!"
the
woman's
voice
echoed
across
the
room.
Grouard
glanced
over
and
stopped
in
his
tracks.
"Mon
dieu,
non!"
Through
the
reddish
haze,
he
could
see
that
the
woman
had
actually
lifted
the
large
painting
off
its
cables
and
propped
it
on
the
floor
in
front
of
her.
At
five
feet
tall,
the
canvas
almost
entirely
hid
her
body.
Grouard's
first
thought
was
to
wonder
why
the
painting's
trip
wires
hadn't
set
off
alarms,
but
of
course
the
artwork
cable
sensors
had
yet
to
be
reset
tonight.
What
is
she
doing!
When
he
saw
it,
his
blood
went
cold.
The
canvas
started
to
bulge
in
the
middle,
the
fragile
outlines
of
the
Virgin
Mary,
Baby
Jesus,
and
John
the
Baptist
beginning
to
distort.
"Non!"
Grouard
screamed,
frozen
in
horror
as
he
watched
the
priceless
Da
Vinci
stretching.
The
woman
was
pushing
her
knee
into
the
center
of
the
canvas
from
behind!
"NON!"
Grouard
wheeled
and
aimed
his
gun
at
her
but
instantly
realized
it
was
an
empty
threat.
The
canvas
was
only
fabric,
but
it
was
utterly
impenetrable
a
six
million
dollar
piece
of
body
armor.
can
't
put
a
bullet
through
a
Da
Vinci!
"Set
down
your
gun
and
radio,"
the
woman
said
in
calm
French,
"or
I'll
put
my
knee
through
this
painting.
I
think
you
know
how
my
grandfather
would
feel
about
that."
Grouard
felt
dizzy.
"Please
no.
That's
Madonna
of
the
Rocks!"
He
dropped
his
gun
and
radio,
raising
his
hands
over
his
head.
"Thank
you,"
the
woman
said.
"Now
do
exactly
as
I
tell
you,
and
everything
will
work
out
fine."
Moments
later,
Langdon's
pulse
was
still
thundering
as
he
ran
beside
Sophie
down
the
emergency
stairwell
toward
the
ground
level.
Neither
of
them
had
said
a
word
since
leaving
the
trembling
Louvre
guard
lying
in
the
Salle
des
Etats.
The
guard's
pistol
was
now
clutched
tightly
in
Langdon's
hands,
and
he
couldn't
wait
to
get
rid
of
it.
The
weapon
felt
heavy
and
dangerously
foreign.
Taking
the
stairs
two
at
a
time,
Langdon
wondered
if
Sophie
had
any
idea
how
valuable
a
painting
she
had
almost
ruined.
Her
choice
in
art
seemed
eerily
pertinent
to
tonight's
adventure.
The
Da
Vinci
she
had
grabbed,
much
like
the
Mona
Lisa,
was
notorious
among
art
historians
for
its
plethora
of
hidden
pagan
symbolism.
"You
chose
a
valuable
hostage,"
he
said
as
they
ran.
"Madonna
of
the
Rocks,
"
she
replied.
"But
I
didn't
choose
it,
my
grandfather
did.
He
left
me
a
little
something
behind
the
painting."
Langdon
shot
her
a
startled
look.
"What!?
But
how
did
you
know
which
painting?
Why
Madonna
of
the
Rocks?"
"So
dark
the
con
of
man."
She
flashed
a
triumphant
smile.
"I
missed
the
first
two
anagrams,
Robert.
I
wasn't
about
to
miss
the
third."
"They're
dead!"
Sister
Sandrine
stammered
into
the
telephone
in
her
Saint
Sulpice
residence.
She
was
leaving
a
message
on
an
answering
machine.
"Please
pick
up!
They're
all
dead!"
The
first
three
phone
numbers
on
the
list
had
produced
terrifying
results
a
hysterical
widow,
a
detective
working
late
at
a
murder
scene,
and
a
somber
priest
consoling
a
bereaved
family.
All
three
contacts
were
dead.
And
now,
as
she
called
the
fourth
and
final
number
the
number
she
was
not
supposed
to
call
unless
the
first
three
could
not
be
reached
she
got
an
answering
machine.
The
outgoing
message
offered
no
name
but
simply
asked
the
caller
to
leave
a
message.
"The
floor
panel
has
been
broken!"
she
pleaded
as
she
left
the
message.
"The
other
three
are
dead!"
Sister
Sandrine
did
not
know
the
identities
of
the
four
men
she
protected,
but
the
private
phone
numbers
stashed
beneath
her
bed
were
for
use
on
only
one
condition.
If
that
floor
panel
is
ever
broken,
the
faceless
messenger
had
told
her,
it
means
the
upper
echelon
has
been
breached.
One
of
us
has
been
mortally
threatened
and
been
forced
to
tell
a
desperate
lie.
Call
the
numbers.
Warn
the
others.
Do
not
fail
us
in
this.
It
was
a
silent
alarm.
Foolproof
in
its
simplicity.
The
plan
had
amazed
her
when
she
first
heard
it.
If
the
identity
of
one
brother
was
compromised,
he
could
tell
a
lie
that
would
start
in
motion
a
mechanism
to
warn
the
others.
Tonight,
however,
it
seemed
that
more
than
one
had
been
compromised.
"Please
answer,"
she
whispered
in
fear.
"Where
are
you?"
"Hang
up
the
phone,"
a
deep
voice
said
from
the
doorway.
Turning
in
terror,
she
saw
the
massive
monk.
He
was
clutching
the
heavy
iron
candle
stand.
Shaking,
she
set
the
phone
back
in
the
cradle.
"They
are
dead,"
the
monk
said.
"All
four
of
them.
And
they
have
played
me
for
a
fool.
Tell
me
where
the
keystone
is."
"I
don't
know!"
Sister
Sandrine
said
truthfully.
"That
secret
is
guarded
by
others."
Others
who
are
dead!
The
man
advanced,
his
white
fists
gripping
the
iron
stand.
"You
are
a
sister
of
the
Church,
and
yet
you
serve
them?"
"Jesus
had
but
one
true
message,"
Sister
Sandrine
said
defiantly.
"I
cannot
see
that
message
in
Opus
Dei."
A
sudden
explosion
of
rage
erupted
behind
the
monk's
eyes.
He
lunged,
lashing
out
with
the
candle
stand
like
a
club.
As
Sister
Sandrine
fell,
her
last
feeling
was
an
overwhelming
sense
of
foreboding.
All
four
are
dead.
The
precious
truth
is
lost
forever.
The
security
alarm
on
the
west
end
of
the
Denon
Wing
sent
the
pigeons
in
the
nearby
Tuileries
Gardens
scattering
as
Langdon
and
Sophie
dashed
out
of
the
bulkhead
into
the
Paris
night.
As
they
ran
across
the
plaza
to
Sophie's
car,
Langdon
could
hear
police
sirens
wailing
in
the
distance.
"That's
it
there,"
Sophie
called,
pointing
to
a
red
snub
nosed
two
seater
parked
on
the
plaza.
She's
kidding,
right?
The
vehicle
was
easily
the
smallest
car
Langdon
had
ever
seen.
"SmartCar,"
she
said.
"A
hundred
kilometers
to
the
liter."
Langdon
had
barely
thrown
himself
into
the
passenger
seat
before
Sophie
gunned
the
SmartCar
up
and
over
a
curb
onto
a
gravel
divider.
He
gripped
the
dash
as
the
car
shot
out
across
a
sidewalk
and
bounced
back
down
over
into
the
small
rotary
at
Carrousel
du
Louvre.
For
an
instant,
Sophie
seemed
to
consider
taking
the
shortcut
across
the
rotary
by
plowing
straight
ahead,
through
the
median's
perimeter
hedge,
and
bisecting
the
large
circle
of
grass
in
the
center.
"No!"
Langdon
shouted,
knowing
the
hedges
around
Carrousel
du
Louvre
were
there
to
hide
the
perilous
chasm
in
the
center
La
Pyramide
Inversee
the
upside
down
pyramid
skylight
he
had
seen
earlier
from
inside
the
museum.
It
was
large
enough
to
swallow
their
Smart
Car
in
a
single
gulp.
Fortunately,
Sophie
decided
on
the
more
conventional
route,
jamming
the
wheel
hard
to
the
right,
circling
properly
until
she
exited,
cut
left,
and
swung
into
the
northbound
lane,
accelerating
toward
Rue
de
Rivoli.
The
two
tone
police
sirens
blared
louder
behind
them,
and
Langdon
could
see
the
lights
now
in
his
side
view
mirror.
The
SmartCar
engine
whined
in
protest
as
Sophie
urged
it
faster
away
from
the
Louvre.
Fifty
yards
ahead,
the
traffic
light
at
Rivoli
turned
red.
Sophie
cursed
under
her
breath
and
kept
racing
toward
it.
Langdon
felt
his
muscles
tighten.
"Sophie?"
Slowing
only
slightly
as
they
reached
the
intersection,
Sophie
flicked
her
headlights
and
stole
a
quick
glance
both
ways
before
flooring
the
accelerator
again
and
carving
a
sharp
left
turn
through
the
empty
intersection
onto
Rivoli.
Accelerating
west
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile,
Sophie
banked
to
the
right
around
a
wide
rotary.
Soon
they
were
shooting
out
the
other
side
onto
the
wide
avenue
of
Champs
Ely
sees.
As
they
straightened
out,
Langdon
turned
in
his
seat,
craning
his
neck
to
look
out
the
rear
window
toward
the
Louvre.
The
police
did
not
seem
to
be
chasing
them.
The
sea
of
blue
lights
was
assembling
at
the
museum.
His
heartbeat
finally
slowing,
Langdon
turned
back
around.
"That
was
interesting."
Sophie
didn't
seem
to
hear.
Her
eyes
remained
fixed
ahead
down
the
long
thoroughfare
of
Champs
Elysees,
the
two
mile
stretch
of
posh
storefronts
that
was
often
called
the
Fifth
Avenue
of
Paris.
The
embassy
was
only
about
a
mile
away,
and
Langdon
settled
into
his
seat.
So
dark
the
con
of
man.
Sophie's
quick
thinking
had
been
impressive.
Madonna
of
the
Rocks.
Sophie
had
said
her
grandfather
left
her
something
behind
the
painting.
A
final
message?
Langdon
could
not
help
but
marvel
over
Sauniere's
brilliant
hiding
place;
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
was
yet
another
fitting
link
in
the
evening's
chain
of
interconnected
symbolism.
Sauniere,
it
seemed,
at
every
turn,
was
reinforcing
his
fondness
for
the
dark
and
mischievous
side
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
Da
Vinci's
original
commission
for
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
had
come
from
an
organization
known
as
the
Confraternity
of
the
Immaculate
Conception,
which
needed
a
painting
for
the
centerpiece
of
an
altar
triptych
in
their
church
of
San
Francesco
in
Milan.
The
nuns
gave
Leonardo
specific
dimensions,
and
the
desired
theme
for
the
painting
the
Virgin
Mary,
baby
John
the
Baptist,
Uriel,
and
Baby
Jesus
sheltering
in
a
cave.
Although
Da
Vinci
did
as
they
requested,
when
he
delivered
the
work,
the
group
reacted
with
horror.
He
had
filled
the
painting
with
explosive
and
disturbing
details.
The
painting
showed
a
blue
robed
Virgin
Mary
sitting
with
her
arm
around
an
infant
child,
presumably
Baby
Jesus.
Opposite
Mary
sat
Uriel,
also
with
an
infant,
presumably
baby
John
the
Baptist.
Oddly,
though,
rather
than
the
usual
Jesus
blessing
John
scenario,
it
was
baby
John
who
was
blessing
Jesus
and
Jesus
was
submitting
to
his
authority!
More
troubling
still,
Mary
was
holding
one
hand
high
above
the
head
of
infant
John
and
making
a
decidedly
threatening
gesture
her
fingers
looking
like
eagle's
talons,
gripping
an
invisible
head.
Finally,
the
most
obvious
and
frightening
image:
Just
below
Mary's
curled
fingers,
Uriel
was
making
a
cutting
gesture
with
his
hand
as
if
slicing
the
neck
of
the
invisible
head
gripped
by
Mary's
claw
like
hand.
Langdon's
students
were
always
amused
to
learn
that
Da
Vinci
eventually
mollified
the
confraternity
by
painting
them
a
second,
"watered
down"
version
of
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
in
which
everyone
was
arranged
in
a
more
orthodox
manner.
The
second
version
now
hung
in
London's
National
Gallery
under
the
name
Virgin
of
the
Rocks,
although
Langdon
still
preferred
the
Louvre's
more
intriguing
original.
As
Sophie
gunned
the
car
up
Champs
Elysees,
Langdon
said,
"The
painting.
What
was
behind
it?"
Her
eyes
remained
on
the
road.
"I'll
show
you
once
we're
safely
inside
the
embassy."
"You'll
show
it
to
me?"
Langdon
was
surprised.
"He
left
you
a
physical
object?"
Sophie
gave
a
curt
nod.
"Embossed
with
a
fleur
de
lis
and
the
initials
P.S."
Langdon
couldn't
believe
his
ears.
We're
going
to
make
it,
Sophie
thought
as
she
swung
the
SmartCar's
wheel
to
the
right,
cutting
sharply
past
the
luxurious
Hotel
de
Crillon
into
Paris's
tree
lined
diplomatic
neighborhood.
The
embassy
was
less
than
a
mile
away
now.
She
was
finally
feeling
like
she
could
breathe
normally
again.
Even
as
she
drove,
Sophie's
mind
remained
locked
on
the
key
in
her
pocket,
her
memories
of
seeing
it
many
years
ago,
the
gold
head
shaped
as
an
equal
armed
cross,
the
triangular
shaft,
the
indentations,
the
embossed
flowery
seal,
and
the
letters
P.S.
Although
the
key
barely
had
entered
Sophie's
thoughts
through
the
years,
her
work
in
the
intelligence
community
had
taught
her
plenty
about
security,
and
now
the
key's
peculiar
tooling
no
longer
looked
so
mystifying.
A
laser
tooled
varying
matrix.
Impossible
to
duplicate.
Rather
than
teeth
that
moved
tumblers,
this
key's
complex
series
of
laser
burned
pockmarks
was
examined
by
an
electric
eye.
If
the
eye
determined
that
the
hexagonal
pockmarks
were
correctly
spaced,
arranged,
and
rotated,
then
the
lock
would
open.
Sophie
could
not
begin
to
imagine
what
a
key
like
this
opened,
but
she
sensed
Robert
would
be
able
to
tell
her.
After
all,
he
had
described
the
key's
embossed
seal
without
ever
seeing
it.
The
cruciform
on
top
implied
the
key
belonged
to
some
kind
of
Christian
organization,
and
yet
Sophie
knew
of
no
churches
that
used
laser
tooled
varying
matrix
keys.
Besides,
my
grandfather
was
no
Christian.
Sophie
had
witnessed
proof
of
that
ten
years
ago.
Ironically,
it
had
been
another
key
a
far
more
normal
one
that
had
revealed
his
true
nature
to
her.
The
afternoon
had
been
warm
when
she
landed
at
Charles
de
Gaulle
Airport
and
hailed
a
taxi
home.
Grand
pere
will
be
so
surprised
to
see
me,
she
thought.
Returning
from
graduate
school
in
Britain
for
spring
break
a
few
days
early,
Sophie
couldn't
wait
to
see
him
and
tell
him
all
about
the
encryption
methods
she
was
studying.
When
she
arrived
at
their
Paris
home,
however,
her
grandfather
was
not
there.
Disappointed,
she
knew
he
had
not
been
expecting
her
and
was
probably
working
at
the
Louvre.
But
it's
Saturday
afternoon,
she
realized.
He
seldom
worked
on
weekends.
On
weekends,
he
usually
Grinning,
Sophie
ran
out
to
the
garage.
Sure
enough,
his
car
was
gone.
It
was
the
weekend.
Jacques
Sauniere
despised
city
driving
and
owned
a
car
for
one
destination
only
his
vacation
chateau
in
Normandy,
north
of
Paris.
Sophie,
after
months
in
the
congestion
of
London,
was
eager
for
the
smells
of
nature
and
to
start
her
vacation
right
away.
It
was
still
early
evening,
and
she
decided
to
leave
immediately
and
surprise
him.
Borrowing
a
friend's
car,
Sophie
drove
north,
winding
into
the
deserted
moon
swept
hills
near
Creully.
She
arrived
just
after
ten
o'clock,
turning
down
the
long
private
driveway
toward
her
grandfather's
retreat.
The
access
road
was
over
a
mile
long,
and
she
was
halfway
down
it
before
she
could
start
to
see
the
house
through
the
trees
a
mammoth,
old
stone
chateau
nestled
in
the
woods
on
the
side
of
a
hill.
Sophie
had
half
expected
to
find
her
grandfather
asleep
at
this
hour
and
was
excited
to
see
the
house
twinkling
with
lights.
Her
delight
turned
to
surprise,
however,
when
she
arrived
to
find
the
driveway
filled
with
parked
cars
Mercedeses,
BMWs,
Audis,
and
a
Rolls
Royce.
Sophie
stared
a
moment
and
then
burst
out
laughing.
My
grand
pere,
the
famous
recluse!
Jacques
Sauniere,
it
seemed,
was
far
less
reclusive
than
he
liked
to
pretend.
Clearly
he
was
hosting
a
party
while
Sophie
was
away
at
school,
and
from
the
looks
of
the
automobiles,
some
of
Paris's
most
influential
people
were
in
attendance.
Eager
to
surprise
him,
she
hurried
to
the
front
door.
When
she
got
there,
though,
she
found
it
locked.
She
knocked.
Nobody
answered.
Puzzled,
she
walked
around
and
tried
the
back
door.
It
too
was
locked.
No
answer.
Confused,
she
stood
a
moment
and
listened.
The
only
sound
she
heard
was
the
cool
Normandy
air
letting
out
a
low
moan
as
it
swirled
through
the
valley.
No
music.
No
voices.
Nothing.
In
the
silence
of
the
woods,
Sophie
hurried
to
the
side
of
the
house
and
clambered
up
on
a
woodpile,
pressing
her
face
to
the
living
room
window.
What
she
saw
inside
made
no
sense
at
all.
"Nobody's
here!"
The
entire
first
floor
looked
deserted.
Where
are
all
the
people
?
Heart
racing,
Sophie
ran
to
the
woodshed
and
got
the
spare
key
her
grandfather
kept
hidden
under
the
kindling
box.
She
ran
to
the
front
door
and
let
herself
in.
As
she
stepped
into
the
deserted
foyer,
the
control
panel
for
the
security
system
started
blinking
red
a
warning
that
the
entrant
had
ten
seconds
to
type
the
proper
code
before
the
security
alarms
went
off.
He
has
the
alarm
on
during
a
party?
Sophie
quickly
typed
the
code
and
deactivated
the
system.
Entering,
she
found
the
entire
house
uninhabited.
Upstairs
too.
As
she
descended
again
to
the
deserted
living
room,
she
stood
a
moment
in
the
silence,
wondering
what
could
possibly
be
happening.
It
was
then
that
Sophie
heard
it.
Muffled
voices.
And
they
seemed
to
be
coming
from
underneath
her.
Sophie
could
not
imagine.
Crouching,
she
put
her
ear
to
the
floor
and
listened.
Yes,
the
sound
was
definitely
coming
from
below.
The
voices
seemed
to
be
singing,
or
chanting?
She
was
frightened.
Almost
more
eerie
than
the
sound
itself
was
the
realization
that
this
house
did
not
even
have
a
basement.
At
least
none
I've
ever
seen.
Turning
now
and
scanning
the
living
room,
Sophie's
eyes
fell
to
the
only
object
in
the
entire
house
that
seemed
out
of
place
her
grandfather's
favorite
antique,
a
sprawling
Aubusson
tapestry.
It
usually
hung
on
the
east
wall
beside
the
fireplace,
but
tonight
it
had
been
pulled
aside
on
its
brass
rod,
exposing
the
wall
behind
it.
Walking
toward
the
bare
wooden
wall,
Sophie
sensed
the
chanting
getting
louder.
Hesitant,
she
leaned
her
ear
against
the
wood.
The
voices
were
clearer
now.
People
were
definitely
chanting
intoning
words
Sophie
could
not
discern.
The
space
behind
this
wall
is
hollow!
Feeling
around
the
edge
of
the
panels,
Sophie
found
a
recessed
fingerhold.
It
was
discreetly
crafted.
A
sliding
door.
Heart
pounding,
she
placed
her
finger
in
the
slot
and
pulled
it.
With
noiseless
precision,
the
heavy
wall
slid
sideways.
From
out
of
the
darkness
beyond,
the
voices
echoed
up.
Sophie
slipped
through
the
door
and
found
herself
on
a
rough
hewn
stone
staircase
that
spiraled
downward.
She'd
been
coming
to
this
house
since
she
was
a
child
and
yet
had
no
idea
this
staircase
even
existed!
As
she
descended,
the
air
grew
cooler.
The
voices
clearer.
She
heard
men
and
women
now.
Her
line
of
sight
was
limited
by
the
spiral
of
the
staircase,
but
the
last
step
was
now
rounding
into
view.
Beyond
it,
she
could
see
a
small
patch
of
the
basement
floor
stone,
illuminated
by
the
flickering
orange
blaze
of
firelight.
Holding
her
breath,
Sophie
inched
down
another
few
steps
and
crouched
down
to
look.
It
took
her
several
seconds
to
process
what
she
was
seeing.
The
room
was
a
grotto
a
coarse
chamber
that
appeared
to
have
been
hollowed
from
the
granite
of
the
hillside.
The
only
light
came
from
torches
on
the
walls.
In
the
glow
of
the
flames,
thirty
or
so
people
stood
in
a
circle
in
the
center
of
the
room.
I'm
dreaming,
Sophie
told
herself.
A
dream.
What
else
could
this
be?
Everyone
in
the
room
was
wearing
a
mask.
The
women
were
dressed
in
white
gossamer
gowns
and
golden
shoes.
Their
masks
were
white,
and
in
their
hands
they
carried
golden
orbs.
The
men
wore
long
black
tunics,
and
their
masks
were
black.
They
looked
like
pieces
in
a
giant
chess
set.
Everyone
in
the
circle
rocked
back
and
forth
and
chanted
in
reverence
to
something
on
the
floor
before
them
something
Sophie
could
not
see.
The
chanting
grew
steady
again.
Accelerating.
Thundering
now.
Faster.
The
participants
took
a
step
inward
and
knelt.
In
that
instant,
Sophie
could
finally
see
what
they
all
were
witnessing.
Even
as
she
staggered
back
in
horror,
she
felt
the
image
searing
itself
into
her
memory
forever.
Overtaken
by
nausea,
Sophie
spun,
clutching
at
the
stone
walls
as
she
clambered
back
up
the
stairs.
Pulling
the
door
closed,
she
fled
the
deserted
house,
and
drove
in
a
tearful
stupor
back
to
Paris.
That
night,
with
her
life
shattered
by
disillusionment
and
betrayal,
she
packed
her
belongings
and
left
her
home.
On
the
dining
room
table,
she
left
a
note.
I
WAS
THERE.
DON'T
TRY
TO
FIND
ME.
Beside
the
note,
she
laid
the
old
spare
key
from
the
chateau's
woodshed.
"Sophie!
Langdon's
voice
intruded.
"Stop!
Stop!"
Emerging
from
the
memory,
Sophie
slammed
on
the
brakes,
skidding
to
a
halt.
"What?
What
happened?
!
Langdon
pointed
down
the
long
street
before
them.
When
she
saw
it,
Sophie's
blood
went
cold.
A
hundred
yards
ahead,
the
intersection
was
blocked
by
a
couple
of
DCPJ
police
cars,
parked
askew,
their
purpose
obvious.
They've
sealed
off
Avenue
Gabriel!
Langdon
gave
a
grim
sigh.
"I
take
it
the
embassy
is
off
limits
this
evening?"
Down
the
street,
the
two
DCPJ
officers
who
stood
beside
their
cars
were
now
staring
in
their
direction,
apparently
curious
about
the
headlights
that
had
halted
so
abruptly
up
the
street
from
them.
Okay,
Sophie,
turn
around
very
slowly.
Putting
the
SmartCar
in
reverse,
she
performed
a
composed
three
point
turn
and
reversed
her
direction.
As
she
drove
away,
she
heard
the
sound
of
squealing
tires
behind
them.
Sirens
blared
to
life.
Cursing,
Sophie
slammed
down
the
accelerator.
Sophie's
SmartCar
tore
through
the
diplomatic
quarter,
weaving
past
embassies
and
consulates,
finally
racing
out
a
side
street
and
taking
a
right
turn
back
onto
the
massive
thoroughfare
of
Champs
Elysees.
Langdon
sat
white
knuckled
in
the
passenger
seat,
twisted
backward,
scanning
behind
them
for
any
signs
of
the
police.
He
suddenly
wished
he
had
not
decided
to
run.
You
didn't,
he
reminded
himself.
Sophie
had
made
the
decision
for
him
when
she
threw
the
GPS
dot
out
the
bathroom
window.
Now,
as
they
sped
away
from
the
embassy,
serpentining
through
sparse
traffic
on
Champs
Elysees,
Langdon
felt
his
options
deteriorating.
Although
Sophie
seemed
to
have
lost
the
police,
at
least
for
the
moment,
Langdon
doubted
their
luck
would
hold
for
long.
Behind
the
wheel
Sophie
was
fishing
in
her
sweater
pocket.
She
removed
a
small
metal
object
and
held
it
out
for
him.
"Robert,
you'd
better
have
a
look
at
this.
This
is
what
my
grandfather
left
me
behind
Madonna
of
the
Rocks.
Feeling
a
shiver
of
anticipation,
Langdon
took
the
object
and
examined
it.
It
was
heavy
and
shaped
like
a
cruciform.
His
first
instinct
was
that
he
was
holding
a
funeral
pieu
a
miniature
version
of
a
memorial
spike
designed
to
be
stuck
into
the
ground
at
a
gravesite.
But
then
he
noted
the
shaft
protruding
from
the
cruciform
was
prismatic
and
triangular.
The
shaft
was
also
pockmarked
with
hundreds
of
tiny
hexagons
that
appeared
to
be
finely
tooled
and
scattered
at
random.
"It's
a
laser
cut
key,"
Sophie
told
him.
"Those
hexagons
are
read
by
an
electric
eye."
A
key?
Langdon
had
never
seen
anything
like
it.
"Look
at
the
other
side,"
she
said,
changing
lanes
and
sailing
through
an
intersection.
When
Langdon
turned
the
key,
he
felt
his
jaw
drop.
There,
intricately
embossed
on
the
center
of
the
cross,
was
a
stylized
fleur
de
lis
with
the
initials
P.S.!
"Sophie,"
he
said,
"this
is
the
seal
I
told
you
about!
The
official
device
of
the
Priory
of
Sion."
She
nodded.
"As
I
told
you,
I
saw
the
key
a
long
time
ago.
He
told
me
never
to
speak
of
it
again."
Langdon's
eyes
were
still
riveted
on
the
embossed
key.
Its
high
tech
tooling
and
age
old
symbolism
exuded
an
eerie
fusion
of
ancient
and
modern
worlds.
"He
told
me
the
key
opened
a
box
where
he
kept
many
secrets."
Langdon
felt
a
chill
to
imagine
what
kind
of
secrets
a
man
like
Jacques
Sauniere
might
keep.
What
an
ancient
brotherhood
was
doing
with
a
futuristic
key,
Langdon
had
no
idea.
The
Priory
existed
for
the
sole
purpose
of
protecting
a
secret.
A
secret
of
incredible
power.
Could
this
key
have
something
to
do
with
it?
The
thought
was
overwhelming.
"Do
you
know
what
it
opens?"
Sophie
looked
disappointed.
"I
was
hoping
you
knew."
Langdon
remained
silent
as
he
turned
the
cruciform
in
his
hand,
examining
it.
"It
looks
Christian,"
Sophie
pressed.
Langdon
was
not
so
sure
about
that.
The
head
of
this
key
was
not
the
traditional
long
stemmed
Christian
cross
but
rather
was
a
square
cross
with
four
arms
of
equal
length
which
predated
Christianity
by
fifteen
hundred
years.
This
kind
of
cross
carried
none
of
the
Christian
connotations
of
crucifixion
associated
with
the
longerstemmed
Latin
Cross,
originated
by
Romans
as
a
torture
device.
Langdon
was
always
surprised
how
few
Christians
who
gazed
upon
"the
crucifix"
realized
their
symbol's
violent
history
was
reflected
in
its
very
name:
"cross"
and
"crucifix"
came
from
the
Latin
verb
cruciare
to
torture.
"Sophie,"
he
said,
"all
I
can
tell
you
is
that
equal
armed
crosses
like
this
one
are
considered
peaceful
crosses.
Their
square
configurations
make
them
impractical
for
use
in
crucifixion,
and
their
balanced
vertical
and
horizontal
elements
convey
a
natural
union
of
male
and
female,
making
them
symbolically
consistent
with
Priory
philosophy.
She
gave
him
a
weary
look.
"You
have
no
idea,
do
you?"
Langdon
frowned.
"Not
a
clue."
"Okay,
we
have
to
get
off
the
road."
Sophie
checked
her
rearview
mirror.
"We
need
a
safe
place
to
figure
out
what
that
key
opens."
Langdon
thought
longingly
of
his
comfortable
room
at
the
Ritz.
Obviously,
that
was
not
an
option.
"How
about
my
hosts
at
the
American
University
of
Paris?"
"Too
obvious.
Fache
will
check
with
them."
"You
must
know
people.
You
live
here."
"Fache
will
run
my
phone
and
e
mail
records,
talk
to
my
coworkers.
My
contacts
are
compromised,
and
finding
a
hotel
is
no
good
because
they
all
require
identification.
Langdon
wondered
again
if
he
might
have
been
better
off
taking
his
chances
letting
Fache
arrest
him
at
the
Louvre.
"Let's
call
the
embassy.
I
can
explain
the
situation
and
have
the
embassy
send
someone
to
meet
us
somewhere."
"Meet
us?"
Sophie
turned
and
stared
at
him
as
if
he
were
crazy.
"Robert,
you're
dreaming.
Your
embassy
has
no
jurisdiction
except
on
their
own
property.
Sending
someone
to
retrieve
us
would
be
considered
aiding
a
fugitive
of
the
French
government.
It
won't
happen.
If
you
walk
into
your
embassy
and
request
temporary
asylum,
that's
one
thing,
but
asking
them
to
take
action
against
French
law
enforcement
in
the
field?"
She
shook
her
head.
"Call
your
embassy
right
now,
and
they
are
going
to
tell
you
to
avoid
further
damage
and
turn
yourself
over
to
Fache.
Then
they'll
promise
to
pursue
diplomatic
channels
to
get
you
a
fair
trial.
"
She
gazed
up
the
line
of
elegant
storefronts
on
Champs
Ely
sees.
"How
much
cash
do
you
have?"
Langdon
checked
his
wallet.
"A
hundred
dollars.
A
few
euro.
Why?"
"Credit
cards?"
"Of
course."
As
Sophie
accelerated,
Langdon
sensed
she
was
formulating
a
plan.
Dead
ahead,
at
the
end
of
Champs
Elysees,
stood
the
Arc
de
Triomphe
Napoleon's
164
foot
tall
tribute
to
his
own
military
potency
encircled
by
France's
largest
rotary,
a
nine
lane
behemoth.
Sophie's
eyes
were
on
the
rearview
mirror
again
as
they
approached
the
rotary.
"We
lost
them
for
the
time
being,"
she
said,
"but
we
won't
last
another
five
minutes
if
we
stay
in
this
car."
So
steal
a
different
one,
Langdon
mused,
now
that
we're
criminals.
"What
are
you
going
to
do?"
Sophie
gunned
the
SmartCar
into
the
rotary.
"Trust
me."
Langdon
made
no
response.
Trust
had
not
gotten
him
very
far
this
evening.
Pulling
back
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket,
he
checked
his
watch
a
vintage,
collector's
edition
Mickey
Mouse
wristwatch
that
had
been
a
gift
from
his
parents
on
his
tenth
birthday.
Although
its
juvenile
dial
often
drew
odd
looks,
Langdon
had
never
owned
any
other
watch;
Disney
animations
had
been
his
first
introduction
to
the
magic
of
form
and
color,
and
Mickey
now
served
as
Langdon's
daily
reminder
to
stay
young
at
heart.
At
the
moment,
however,
Mickey's
arms
were
skewed
at
an
awkward
angle,
indicating
an
equally
awkward
hour.
2:51A.M.
"Interesting
watch,"
Sophie
said,
glancing
at
his
wrist
and
maneuvering
the
SmartCar
around
the
wide,
counterclockwise
rotary.
"Long
story,"
he
said,
pulling
his
sleeve
back
down.
"I
imagine
it
would
have
to
be."
She
gave
him
a
quick
smile
and
exited
the
rotary,
heading
due
north,
away
from
the
city
center.
Barely
making
two
green
lights,
she
reached
the
third
intersection
and
took
a
hard
right
onto
Boulevard
Malesherbes.
They'd
left
the
rich,
tree
lined
streets
of
the
diplomatic
neighborhood
and
plunged
into
a
darker
industrial
neighborhood.
Sophie
took
a
quick
left,
and
a
moment
later,
Langdon
realized
where
they
were.
Gare
Saint
Lazare.
Ahead
of
them,
the
glass
roofed
train
terminal
resembled
the
awkward
offspring
of
an
airplane
hangar
and
a
greenhouse.
European
train
stations
never
slept.
Even
at
this
hour,
a
half
dozen
taxis
idled
near
the
main
entrance.
Vendors
manned
carts
of
sandwiches
and
mineral
water
while
grungy
kids
in
backpacks
emerged
from
the
station
rubbing
their
eyes,
looking
around
as
if
trying
to
remember
what
city
they
were
in
now.
Up
ahead
on
the
street,
a
couple
of
city
policemen
stood
on
the
curb
giving
directions
to
some
confused
tourists.
Sophie
pulled
her
SmartCar
in
behind
the
line
of
taxis
and
parked
in
a
red
zone
despite
plenty
of
legal
parking
across
the
street.
Before
Langdon
could
ask
what
was
going
on,
she
was
out
of
the
car.
She
hurried
to
the
window
of
the
taxi
in
front
of
them
and
began
speaking
to
the
driver.
As
Langdon
got
out
of
the
SmartCar,
he
saw
Sophie
hand
the
taxi
driver
a
big
wad
of
cash.
The
taxi
driver
nodded
and
then,
to
Langdon's
bewilderment,
sped
off
without
them.
"What
happened?"
Langdon
demanded,
joining
Sophie
on
the
curb
as
the
taxi
disappeared.
Sophie
was
already
heading
for
the
train
station
entrance.
"Come
on.
We're
buying
two
tickets
on
the
next
train
out
of
Paris."
Langdon
hurried
along
beside
her.
What
had
begun
as
a
one
mile
dash
to
the
U.S.
Embassy
had
now
become
a
full
fledged
evacuation
from
Paris.
Langdon
was
liking
this
idea
less
and
less.
The
driver
who
collected
Bishop
Aringarosa
from
Leonardo
da
Vinci
International
Airport
pulled
up
in
a
small,
unimpressive
black
Fiat
sedan.
Aringarosa
recalled
a
day
when
all
Vatican
transports
were
big
luxury
cars
that
sported
grille
plate
medallions
and
flags
emblazoned
with
the
seal
of
the
Holy
See.
Those
days
are
gone.
Vatican
cars
were
now
less
ostentatious
and
almost
always
unmarked.
The
Vatican
claimed
this
was
to
cut
costs
to
better
serve
their
dioceses,
but
Aringarosa
suspected
it
was
more
of
a
security
measure.
The
world
had
gone
mad,
and
in
many
parts
of
Europe,
advertising
your
love
of
Jesus
Christ
was
like
painting
a
bull's
eye
on
the
roof
of
your
car.
Bundling
his
black
cassock
around
himself,
Aringarosa
climbed
into
the
back
seat
and
settled
in
for
the
long
drive
to
Castel
Gandolfo.
It
would
be
the
same
ride
he
had
taken
five
months
ago.
Last
year's
trip
to
Rome,
he
sighed.
The
longest
night
of
my
life.
Five
months
ago,
the
Vatican
had
phoned
to
request
Aringarosa's
immediate
presence
in
Rome.
They
offered
no
explanation.
Your
tickets
are
at
the
airport.
The
Holy
See
worked
hard
to
retain
a
veil
of
mystery,
even
for
its
highest
clergy.
The
mysterious
summons,
Aringarosa
suspected,
was
probably
a
photo
opportunity
for
the
Pope
and
other
Vatican
officials
to
piggyback
on
Opus
Dei's
recent
public
success
the
completion
of
their
World
Headquarters
in
New
York
City.
Architectural
Digest
had
called
Opus
Dei's
building
"a
shining
beacon
of
Catholicism
sublimely
integrated
with
the
modern
landscape,"
and
lately
the
Vatican
seemed
to
be
drawn
to
anything
and
everything
that
included
the
word
"modern."
Aringarosa
had
no
choice
but
to
accept
the
invitation,
albeit
reluctantly.
Not
a
fan
of
the
current
papal
administration,
Aringarosa,
like
most
conservative
clergy,
had
watched
with
grave
concern
as
the
new
Pope
settled
into
his
first
year
in
office.
An
unprecedented
liberal,
His
Holiness
had
secured
the
papacy
through
one
of
the
most
controversial
and
unusual
conclaves
in
Vatican
history.
Now,
rather
than
being
humbled
by
his
unexpected
rise
to
power,
the
Holy
Father
had
wasted
no
time
flexing
all
the
muscle
associated
with
the
highest
office
in
Christendom.
Drawing
on
an
unsettling
tide
of
liberal
support
within
the
College
of
Cardinals,
the
Pope
was
now
declaring
his
papal
mission
to
be
"rejuvenation
of
Vatican
doctrine
and
updating
Catholicism
into
the
third
millennium."
The
translation,
Aringarosa
feared,
was
that
the
man
was
actually
arrogant
enough
to
think
he
could
rewrite
God's
laws
and
win
back
the
hearts
of
those
who
felt
the
demands
of
true
Catholicism
had
become
too
inconvenient
in
a
modern
world.
Aringarosa
had
been
using
all
of
his
political
sway
substantial
considering
the
size
of
the
Opus
Dei
constituency
and
their
bankroll
to
persuade
the
Pope
and
his
advisers
that
softening
the
Church's
laws
was
not
only
faithless
and
cowardly,
but
political
suicide.
He
reminded
them
that
previous
tempering
of
Church
law
the
Vatican
II
fiasco
had
left
a
devastating
legacy:
Church
attendance
was
now
lower
than
ever,
donations
were
drying
up,
and
there
were
not
even
enough
Catholic
priests
to
preside
over
their
churches.
People
need
structure
and
direction
from
the
Church,
Aringarosa
insisted,
not
coddling
and
indulgence!
On
that
night,
months
ago,
as
the
Fiat
had
left
the
airport,
Aringarosa
was
surprised
to
find
himself
heading
not
toward
Vatican
City
but
rather
eastward
up
a
sinuous
mountain
road.
"Where
are
we
going?"
he
had
demanded
of
his
driver.
"Alban
Hills,"
the
man
replied.
"Your
meeting
is
at
Castel
Gandolfo."
The
Pope
's
summer
residence
?
Aringarosa
had
never
been,
nor
had
he
ever
desired
to
see
it.
In
addition
to
being
the
Pope's
summer
vacation
home,
the
sixteenth
century
citadel
housed
the
Specula
Vaticana
the
Vatican
Observatory
one
of
the
most
advanced
astronomical
observatories
in
Europe.
Aringarosa
had
never
been
comfortable
with
the
Vatican's
historical
need
to
dabble
in
science.
What
was
the
rationale
for
fusing
science
and
faith?
Unbiased
science
could
not
possibly
be
performed
by
a
man
who
possessed
faith
in
God.
Nor
did
faith
have
any
need
for
physical
confirmation
of
its
beliefs.
Nonetheless,
there
it
is,
he
thought
as
Castel
Gandolfo
came
into
view,
rising
against
a
star
filled
November
sky.
From
the
access
road,
Gandolfo
resembled
a
great
stone
monster
pondering
a
suicidal
leap.
Perched
at
the
very
edge
of
a
cliff,
the
castle
leaned
out
over
the
cradle
of
Italian
civilization
the
valley
where
the
Curiazi
and
Orazi
clans
fought
long
before
the
founding
of
Rome.
Even
in
silhouette,
Gandolfo
was
a
sight
to
behold
an
impressive
example
of
tiered,
defensive
architecture,
echoing
the
potency
of
this
dramatic
cliffside
setting.
Sadly,
Aringarosa
now
saw,
the
Vatican
had
ruined
the
building
by
constructing
two
huge
aluminum
telescope
domes
atop
the
roof,
leaving
this
once
dignified
edifice
looking
like
a
proud
warrior
wearing
a
couple
of
party
hats.
When
Aringarosa
got
out
of
the
car,
a
young
Jesuit
priest
hurried
out
and
greeted
him.
"Bishop,
welcome.
I
am
Father
Mangano.
An
astronomer
here."
Good
for
you.
Aringarosa
grumbled
his
hello
and
followed
his
host
into
the
castle's
foyer
a
wide
open
space
whose
decor
was
a
graceless
blend
of
Renaissance
art
and
astronomy
images.
Following
his
escort
up
the
wide
travertine
marble
staircase,
Aringarosa
saw
signs
for
conference
centers,
science
lecture
halls,
and
tourist
information
services.
It
amazed
him
to
think
the
Vatican
was
failing
at
every
turn
to
provide
coherent,
stringent
guidelines
for
spiritual
growth
and
yet
somehow
still
found
time
to
give
astrophysics
lectures
to
tourists.
"Tell
me,"
Aringarosa
said
to
the
young
priest,
"when
did
the
tail
start
wagging
the
dog?"
The
priest
gave
him
an
odd
look.
"Sir?"
Aringarosa
waved
it
off,
deciding
not
to
launch
into
that
particular
offensive
again
this
evening.
The
Vatican
has
gone
mad.
Like
a
lazy
parent
who
found
it
easier
to
acquiesce
to
the
whims
of
a
spoiled
child
than
to
stand
firm
and
teach
values,
the
Church
just
kept
softening
at
every
turn,
trying
to
reinvent
itself
to
accommodate
a
culture
gone
astray.
The
top
floor's
corridor
was
wide,
lushly
appointed,
and
led
in
only
one
direction
toward
a
huge
set
of
oak
doors
with
a
brass
sign.
BIBLIOTECA
ASTRONOMICA
Aringarosa
had
heard
of
this
place
the
Vatican's
Astronomy
Library
rumored
to
contain
more
than
twenty
five
thousand
volumes,
including
rare
works
of
Copernicus,
Galileo,
Kepler,
Newton,
and
Secchi.
Allegedly,
it
was
also
the
place
in
which
the
Pope's
highest
officers
held
private
meetings
those
meetings
they
preferred
not
to
hold
within
the
walls
of
Vatican
City.
Approaching
the
door,
Bishop
Aringarosa
would
never
have
imagined
the
shocking
news
he
was
about
to
receive
inside,
or
the
deadly
chain
of
events
it
would
put
into
motion.
It
was
not
until
an
hour
later,
as
he
staggered
from
the
meeting,
that
the
devastating
implications
settled
in.
Six
months
from
now!
he
had
thought.
God
help
us!
Now,
seated
in
the
Fiat,
Bishop
Aringarosa
realized
his
fists
were
clenched
just
thinking
about
that
first
meeting.
He
released
his
grip
and
forced
a
slow
inhalation,
relaxing
his
muscles.
Everything
will
be
fine,
he
told
himself
as
the
Fiat
wound
higher
into
the
mountains.
Still,
he
wished
his
cell
phone
would
ring.
Why
hasn't
the
Teacher
called
me?
Silas
should
have
the
keystone
by
now.
Trying
to
ease
his
nerves,
the
bishop
meditated
on
the
purple
amethyst
in
his
ring.
Feeling
the
textures
of
the
mitre
crozier
applique
and
the
facets
of
the
diamonds,
he
reminded
himself
that
this
ring
was
a
symbol
of
power
far
less
than
that
which
he
would
soon
attain.
The
inside
of
Gare
Saint
Lazare
looked
like
every
other
train
station
in
Europe,
a
gaping
indoor
outdoor
cavern
dotted
with
the
usual
suspects
homeless
men
holding
cardboard
signs,
collections
of
bleary
eyed
college
kids
sleeping
on
backpacks
and
zoning
out
to
their
portable
MP3
players,
and
clusters
of
blue
clad
baggage
porters
smoking
cigarettes.
Sophie
raised
her
eyes
to
the
enormous
departure
board
overhead.
The
black
and
white
tabs
reshuffled,
ruffling
downward
as
the
information
refreshed.
When
the
update
was
finished,
Langdon
eyed
the
offerings.
The
topmost
listing
read:
LYON
RAPIDE
3:06
"I
wish
it
left
sooner,"
Sophie
said,
"but
Lyon
will
have
to
do."
Sooner?
Langdon
checked
his
watch
2:59
A.M.
The
train
left
in
seven
minutes
and
they
didn't
even
have
tickets
yet.
Sophie
guided
Langdon
toward
the
ticket
window
and
said,
"Buy
us
two
tickets
with
your
credit
card."
"I
thought
credit
card
usage
could
be
traced
by
"Exactly."
Langdon
decided
to
stop
trying
to
keep
ahead
of
Sophie
Neveu.
Using
his
Visa
card,
he
purchased
two
coach
tickets
to
Lyon
and
handed
them
to
Sophie.
Sophie
guided
him
out
toward
the
tracks,
where
a
familiar
tone
chimed
overhead
and
a
P.A.
announcer
gave
the
final
boarding
call
for
Lyon.
Sixteen
separate
tracks
spread
out
before
them.
In
the
distance
to
the
right,
at
quay
three,
the
train
to
Lyon
was
belching
and
wheezing
in
preparation
for
departure,
but
Sophie
already
had
her
arm
through
Langdon's
and
was
guiding
him
in
the
exact
opposite
direction.
They
hurried
through
a
side
lobby,
past
an
all
night
cafe,
and
finally
out
a
side
door
onto
a
quiet
street
on
the
west
side
of
the
station.
A
lone
taxi
sat
idling
by
the
doorway.
The
driver
saw
Sophie
and
flicked
his
lights.
Sophie
jumped
in
the
back
seat.
Langdon
got
in
after
her.
As
the
taxi
pulled
away
from
station,
Sophie
took
out
their
newly
purchased
train
tickets
and
tore
them
up.
Langdon
sighed.
Seventy
dollars
well
spent.
It
was
not
until
their
taxi
had
settled
into
a
monotonous
northbound
hum
on
Rue
de
Clichy
that
Langdon
felt
they'd
actually
escaped.
Out
the
window
to
his
right,
he
could
see
Montmartre
and
the
beautiful
dome
of
Sacre
Coeur.
The
image
was
interrupted
by
the
flash
of
police
lights
sailing
past
them
in
the
opposite
direction.
Langdon
and
Sophie
ducked
down
as
the
sirens
faded.
Sophie
had
told
the
cab
driver
simply
to
head
out
of
the
city,
and
from
her
firmly
set
jaw,
Langdon
sensed
she
was
trying
to
figure
out
their
next
move.
Langdon
examined
the
cruciform
key
again,
holding
it
to
the
window,
bringing
it
close
to
his
eyes
in
an
effort
to
find
any
markings
on
it
that
might
indicate
where
the
key
had
been
made.
In
the
intermittent
glow
of
passing
streetlights,
he
saw
no
markings
except
the
Priory
seal.
"It
doesn't
make
sense,"
he
finally
said.
"Which
part?"
"That
your
grandfather
would
go
to
so
much
trouble
to
give
you
a
key
that
you
wouldn't
know
what
to
do
with."
"I
agree."
"Are
you
sure
he
didn't
write
anything
else
on
the
back
of
the
painting?"
"I
searched
the
whole
area.
This
is
all
there
was.
This
key,
wedged
behind
the
painting.
I
saw
the
Priory
seal,
stuck
the
key
in
my
pocket,
then
we
left."
Langdon
frowned,
peering
now
at
the
blunt
end
of
the
triangular
shaft.
Nothing.
Squinting,
he
brought
the
key
close
to
his
eyes
and
examined
the
rim
of
the
head.
Nothing
there
either.
"I
think
this
key
was
cleaned
recently."
"Why?"
"It
smells
like
rubbing
alcohol."
She
turned.
"I'm
sorry?"
"It
smells
like
somebody
polished
it
with
a
cleaner."
Langdon
held
the
key
to
his
nose
and
sniffed.
"It's
stronger
on
the
other
side."
He
flipped
it
over.
"Yes,
it's
alcohol
based,
like
it's
been
buffed
with
a
cleaner
or
"
Langdon
stopped.
"What?"
He
angled
the
key
to
the
light
and
looked
at
the
smooth
surface
on
the
broad
arm
of
the
cross.
It
seemed
to
shimmer
in
places
like
it
was
wet.
"How
well
did
you
look
at
the
back
of
this
key
before
you
put
it
in
your
pocket?"
"What?
Not
well.
I
was
in
a
hurry."
Langdon
turned
to
her.
"Do
you
still
have
the
black
light?"
Sophie
reached
in
her
pocket
and
produced
the
UV
penlight.
Langdon
took
it
and
switched
it
on,
shining
the
beam
on
the
back
of
the
key.
The
back
luminesced
instantly.
There
was
writing
there.
In
penmanship
that
was
hurried
but
legible.
Well,"
Langdon
said,
smiling.
"I
guess
we
know
what
the
alcohol
smell
was."
Sophie
stared
in
amazement
at
the
purple
writing
on
the
back
of
the
key.
24
Rue
Haxo
An
address!
My
grandfather
wrote
down
an
address!
"Where
is
this?"
Langdon
asked.
Sophie
had
no
idea.
Facing
front
again,
she
leaned
forward
and
excitedly
asked
the
driver,
"Connaissez
vous
la
Rue
Haxo?"
The
driver
thought
a
moment
and
then
nodded.
He
told
Sophie
it
was
out
near
the
tennis
stadium
on
the
western
outskirts
of
Paris.
She
asked
him
to
take
them
there
immediately.
"Fastest
route
is
through
Bois
de
Boulogne,"
the
driver
told
her
in
French.
"Is
that
okay?"
Sophie
frowned.
She
could
think
of
far
less
scandalous
routes,
but
tonight
she
was
not
going
to
be
picky.
"Oui."
We
can
shock
the
visiting
American.
Sophie
looked
back
at
the
key
and
wondered
what
they
would
possibly
find
at
24
Rue
Haxo.
A
church?
Some
kind
of
Priory
headquarters?
Her
mind
filled
again
with
images
of
the
secret
ritual
she
had
witnessed
in
the
basement
grotto
ten
years
ago,
and
she
heaved
a
long
sigh.
"Robert,
I
have
a
lot
of
things
to
tell
you."
She
paused,
locking
eyes
with
him
as
the
taxi
raced
westward.
"But
first
I
want
you
to
tell
me
everything
you
know
about
this
Priory
of
Sion."
Outside
the
Salle
des
Etats,
Bezu
Fache
was
fuming
as
Louvre
warden
Grouard
explained
how
Sophie
and
Langdon
had
disarmed
him.
Why
didn't
you
just
shoot
the
blessed
painting!
"Captain?"
Lieutenant
Collet
loped
toward
them
from
the
direction
of
the
command
post.
"Captain,
I
just
heard.
They
located
Agent
Neveu's
car."
"Did
she
make
the
embassy?"
"No.
Train
station.
Bought
two
tickets.
Train
just
left."
Fache
waved
off
warden
Grouard
and
led
Collet
to
a
nearby
alcove,
addressing
him
in
hushed
tones.
"What
was
the
destination?"
"Lyon."
"Probably
a
decoy."
Fache
exhaled,
formulating
a
plan.
"Okay,
alert
the
next
station,
have
the
train
stopped
and
searched,
just
in
case.
Leave
her
car
where
it
is
and
put
plainclothes
on
watch
in
case
they
try
to
come
back
to
it.
Send
men
to
search
the
streets
around
the
station
in
case
they
fled
on
foot.
Are
buses
running
from
the
station?"
"Not
at
this
hour,
sir.
Only
the
taxi
queue."
"Good.
Question
the
drivers.
See
if
they
saw
anything.
Then
contact
the
taxi
company
dispatcher
with
descriptions.
I'm
calling
Interpol."
Collet
looked
surprised.
"You're
putting
this
on
the
wire?"
Fache
regretted
the
potential
embarrassment,
but
he
saw
no
other
choice.
Close
the
net
fast,
and
close
it
tight.
The
first
hour
was
critical.
Fugitives
were
predictable
the
first
hour
after
escape.
They
always
needed
the
same
thing.
Travel.
Lodging.
Cash.
The
Holy
Trinity.
Interpol
had
the
power
to
make
all
three
disappear
in
the
blink
of
an
eye.
By
broadcast
faxing
photos
of
Langdon
and
Sophie
to
Paris
travel
authorities,
hotels,
and
banks,
Interpol
would
leave
no
options
no
way
to
leave
the
city,
no
place
to
hide,
and
no
way
to
withdraw
cash
without
being
recognized.
Usually,
fugitives
panicked
on
the
street
and
did
something
stupid.
Stole
a
car.
Robbed
a
store.
Used
a
bank
card
in
desperation.
Whatever
mistake
they
committed,
they
quickly
made
their
whereabouts
known
to
local
authorities.
"Only
Langdon,
right?"
Collet
said.
"You're
not
flagging
Sophie
Neveu.
She's
our
own
agent."
"Of
course
I'm
flagging
her!"
Fache
snapped.
"What
good
is
flagging
Langdon
if
she
can
do
all
his
dirty
work?
I
plan
to
run
Neveu's
employment
file
friends,
family,
personal
contacts
anyone
she
might
turn
to
for
help.
I
don't
know
what
she
thinks
she's
doing
out
there,
but
it's
going
to
cost
her
one
hell
of
a
lot
more
than
her
job!"
"Do
you
want
me
on
the
phones
or
in
the
field?"
"Field.
Get
over
to
the
train
station
and
coordinate
the
team.
You've
got
the
reins,
but
don't
make
a
move
without
talking
to
me."
"Yes,
sir."
Collet
ran
out.
Fache
felt
rigid
as
he
stood
in
the
alcove.
Outside
the
window,
the
glass
pyramid
shone,
its
reflection
rippling
in
the
windswept
pools.
They
slipped
through
my
fingers.
He
told
himself
to
relax.
Even
a
trained
field
agent
would
be
lucky
to
withstand
the
pressure
that
Interpol
was
about
to
apply.
A
female
cryptologist
and
a
schoolteacher?
They
wouldn't
last
till
dawn.
The
heavily
forested
park
known
as
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
was
called
many
things,
but
the
Parisian
cognoscenti
knew
it
as
"the
Garden
of
Earthly
Delights."
The
epithet,
despite
sounding
flattering,
was
quite
to
the
contrary.
Anyone
who
had
seen
the
lurid
Bosch
painting
of
the
same
name
understood
the
jab;
the
painting,
like
the
forest,
was
dark
and
twisted,
a
purgatory
for
freaks
and
fetishists.
At
night,
the
forest's
winding
lanes
were
lined
with
hundreds
of
glistening
bodies
for
hire,
earthly
delights
to
satisfy
one's
deepest
unspoken
desires
male,
female,
and
everything
in
between.
As
Langdon
gathered
his
thoughts
to
tell
Sophie
about
the
Priory
of
Sion,
their
taxi
passed
through
the
wooded
entrance
to
the
park
and
began
heading
west
on
the
cobblestone
crossfare.
Langdon
was
having
trouble
concentrating
as
a
scattering
of
the
park's
nocturnal
residents
were
already
emerging
from
the
shadows
and
flaunting
their
wares
in
the
glare
of
the
headlights.
Ahead,
two
topless
teenage
girls
shot
smoldering
gazes
into
the
taxi.
Beyond
them,
a
well
oiled
black
man
in
a
G
string
turned
and
flexed
his
buttocks.
Beside
him,
a
gorgeous
blond
woman
lifted
her
miniskirt
to
reveal
that
she
was
not,
in
fact,
a
woman.
Heaven
help
me!
Langdon
turned
his
gaze
back
inside
the
cab
and
took
a
deep
breath.
"Tell
me
about
the
Priory
of
Sion,"
Sophie
said.
Langdon
nodded,
unable
to
imagine
a
less
congruous
a
backdrop
for
the
legend
he
was
about
to
tell.
He
wondered
where
to
begin.
The
brotherhood's
history
spanned
more
than
a
millennium
an
astonishing
chronicle
of
secrets,
blackmail,
betrayal,
and
even
brutal
torture
at
the
hands
of
an
angry
Pope.
"The
Priory
of
Sion,"
he
began,
"was
founded
in
Jerusalem
in
1099
by
a
French
king
named
Godefroi
de
Bouillon,
immediately
after
he
had
conquered
the
city."
Sophie
nodded,
her
eyes
riveted
on
him.
"King
Godefroi
was
allegedly
the
possessor
of
a
powerful
secret
a
secret
that
had
been
in
his
family
since
the
time
of
Christ.
Fearing
his
secret
might
be
lost
when
he
died,
he
founded
a
secret
brotherhood
the
Priory
of
Sion
and
charged
them
with
protecting
his
secret
by
quietly
passing
it
on
from
generation
to
generation.
During
their
years
in
Jerusalem,
the
Priory
learned
of
a
stash
of
hidden
documents
buried
beneath
the
ruins
of
Herod's
temple,
which
had
been
built
atop
the
earlier
ruins
of
Solomon's
Temple.
These
documents,
they
believed,
corroborated
Godefroi's
powerful
secret
and
were
so
explosive
in
nature
that
the
Church
would
stop
at
nothing
to
get
them."
Sophie
looked
uncertain.
"The
Priory
vowed
that
no
matter
how
long
it
took,
these
documents
must
be
recovered
from
the
rubble
beneath
the
temple
and
protected
forever,
so
the
truth
would
never
die.
In
order
to
retrieve
the
documents
from
within
the
ruins,
the
Priory
created
a
military
arm
a
group
of
nine
knights
called
the
Order
of
the
Poor
Knights
of
Christ
and
the
Temple
of
Solomon."
Langdon
paused.
"More
commonly
known
as
the
Knights
Templar."
Sophie
glanced
up
with
a
surprised
look
of
recognition.
Langdon
had
lectured
often
enough
on
the
Knights
Templar
to
know
that
almost
everyone
on
earth
had
heard
of
them,
at
least
abstractedly.
For
academics,
the
Templars'
history
was
a
precarious
world
where
fact,
lore,
and
misinformation
had
become
so
intertwined
that
extracting
a
pristine
truth
was
almost
impossible.
Nowadays,
Langdon
hesitated
even
to
mention
the
Knights
Templar
while
lecturing
because
it
invariably
led
to
a
barrage
of
convoluted
inquiries
into
assorted
conspiracy
theories.
Sophie
already
looked
troubled.
"You're
saying
the
Knights
Templar
were
founded
by
the
Priory
of
Sion
to
retrieve
a
collection
of
secret
documents?
I
thought
the
Templars
were
created
to
protect
the
Holy
Land."
"A
common
misconception.
The
idea
of
protection
of
pilgrims
was
the
guise
under
which
the
Templars
ran
their
mission.
Their
true
goal
in
the
Holy
Land
was
to
retrieve
the
documents
from
beneath
the
ruins
of
the
temple."
"And
did
they
find
them?"
Langdon
grinned.
"Nobody
knows
for
sure,
but
the
one
thing
on
which
all
academics
agree
is
this:
The
Knights
discovered
something
down
there
in
the
ruins
something
that
made
them
wealthy
and
powerful
beyond
anyone's
wildest
imagination."
Langdon
quickly
gave
Sophie
the
standard
academic
sketch
of
the
accepted
Knights
Templar
history,
explaining
how
the
Knights
were
in
the
Holy
Land
during
the
Second
Crusade
and
told
King
Baldwin
II
that
they
were
there
to
protect
Christian
pilgrims
on
the
roadways.
Although
unpaid
and
sworn
to
poverty,
the
Knights
told
the
king
they
required
basic
shelter
and
requested
his
permission
to
take
up
residence
in
the
stables
under
the
ruins
of
the
temple.
King
Baldwin
granted
the
soldiers'
request,
and
the
Knights
took
up
their
meager
residence
inside
the
devastated
shrine.
The
odd
choice
of
lodging,
Langdon
explained,
had
been
anything
but
random.
The
Knights
believed
the
documents
the
Priory
sought
were
buried
deep
under
the
ruins
beneath
the
Holy
of
Holies,
a
sacred
chamber
where
God
Himself
was
believed
to
reside.
Literally,
the
very
center
of
the
Jewish
faith.
For
almost
a
decade,
the
nine
Knights
lived
in
the
ruins,
excavating
in
total
secrecy
through
solid
rock.
Sophie
looked
over.
"And
you
said
they
discovered
something?"
"They
certainly
did,"
Langdon
said,
explaining
how
it
had
taken
nine
years,
but
the
Knights
had
finally
found
what
they
had
been
searching
for.
They
took
the
treasure
from
the
temple
and
traveled
to
Europe,
where
their
influence
seemed
to
solidify
overnight.
Nobody
was
certain
whether
the
Knights
had
blackmailed
the
Vatican
or
whether
the
Church
simply
tried
to
buy
the
Knights'
silence,
but
Pope
Innocent
II
immediately
issued
an
unprecedented
papal
bull
that
afforded
the
Knights
Templar
limitless
power
and
declared
them
"a
law
unto
themselves"
an
autonomous
army
independent
of
all
interference
from
kings
and
prelates,
both
religious
and
political.
With
their
new
carte
blanche
from
the
Vatican,
the
Knights
Templar
expanded
at
a
staggering
rate,
both
in
numbers
and
political
force,
amassing
vast
estates
in
over
a
dozen
countries.
They
began
extending
credit
to
bankrupt
royals
and
charging
interest
in
return,
thereby
establishing
modern
banking
and
broadening
their
wealth
and
influence
still
further.
By
the
1300s,
the
Vatican
sanction
had
helped
the
Knights
amass
so
much
power
that
Pope
Clement
V
decided
that
something
had
to
be
done.
Working
in
concert
with
France's
King
Philippe
IV,
the
Pope
devised
an
ingeniously
planned
sting
operation
to
quash
the
Templars
and
seize
their
treasure,
thus
taking
control
of
the
secrets
held
over
the
Vatican.
In
a
military
maneuver
worthy
of
the
CIA,
Pope
Clement
issued
secret
sealed
orders
to
be
opened
simultaneously
by
his
soldiers
all
across
Europe
on
Friday,
October
13
of
1307.
At
dawn
on
the
thirteenth,
the
documents
were
unsealed
and
their
appalling
contents
revealed.
Clement's
letter
claimed
that
God
had
visited
him
in
a
vision
and
warned
him
that
the
Knights
Templar
were
heretics
guilty
of
devil
worship,
homosexuality,
defiling
the
cross,
sodomy,
and
other
blasphemous
behavior.
Pope
Clement
had
been
asked
by
God
to
cleanse
the
earth
by
rounding
up
all
the
Knights
and
torturing
them
until
they
confessed
their
crimes
against
God.
Clement's
Machiavellian
operation
came
off
with
clockwork
precision.
On
that
day,
countless
Knights
were
captured,
tortured
mercilessly,
and
finally
burned
at
the
stake
as
heretics.
Echoes
of
the
tragedy
still
resonated
in
modern
culture;
to
this
day,
Friday
the
thirteenth
was
considered
unlucky.
Sophie
looked
confused.
"The
Knights
Templar
were
obliterated?
I
thought
fraternities
of
Templars
still
exist
today?"
"They
do,
under
a
variety
of
names.
Despite
Clement's
false
charges
and
best
efforts
to
eradicate
them,
the
Knights
had
powerful
allies,
and
some
managed
to
escape
the
Vatican
purges.
The
Templars'
potent
treasure
trove
of
documents,
which
had
apparently
been
their
source
of
power,
was
Clement's
true
objective,
but
it
slipped
through
his
fingers.
The
documents
had
long
since
been
entrusted
to
the
Templars'
shadowy
architects,
the
Priory
of
Sion,
whose
veil
of
secrecy
had
kept
them
safely
out
of
range
of
the
Vatican's
onslaught.
As
the
Vatican
closed
in,
the
Priory
smuggled
their
documents
from
a
Paris
preceptory
by
night
onto
Templar
ships
in
La
Rochelle."
"Where
did
the
documents
go?"
Langdon
shrugged.
"That
mystery's
answer
is
known
only
to
the
Priory
of
Sion.
Because
the
documents
remain
the
source
of
constant
investigation
and
speculation
even
today,
they
are
believed
to
have
been
moved
and
rehidden
several
times.
Current
speculation
places
the
documents
somewhere
in
the
United
Kingdom."
Sophie
looked
uneasy.
"For
a
thousand
years,"
Langdon
continued,
"legends
of
this
secret
have
been
passed
on.
The
entire
collection
of
documents,
its
power,
and
the
secret
it
reveals
have
become
known
by
a
single
name
Sangreal.
Hundreds
of
books
have
been
written
about
it,
and
few
mysteries
have
caused
as
much
interest
among
historians
as
the
Sangreal."
"The
Sangreal?
Does
the
word
have
anything
to
do
with
the
French
word
sang
or
Spanish
sangre
meaning
'blood'?"
Langdon
nodded.
Blood
was
the
backbone
of
the
Sangreal,
and
yet
not
in
the
way
Sophie
probably
imagined.
"The
legend
is
complicated,
but
the
important
thing
to
remember
is
that
the
Priory
guards
the
proof,
and
is
purportedly
awaiting
the
right
moment
in
history
to
reveal
the
truth."
"What
truth?
What
secret
could
possibly
be
that
powerful?"
Langdon
took
a
deep
breath
and
gazed
out
at
the
underbelly
of
Paris
leering
in
the
shadows.
"Sophie,
the
word
Sangreal
is
an
ancient
word.
It
has
evolved
over
the
years
into
another
term
a
more
modern
name."
He
paused.
"When
I
tell
you
its
modern
name,
you'll
realize
you
already
know
a
lot
about
it.
In
fact,
almost
everyone
on
earth
has
heard
the
story
of
the
Sangreal."
Sophie
looked
skeptical.
"I've
never
heard
of
it."
"Sure
you
have."
Langdon
smiled.
"You're
just
used
to
hearing
it
called
by
the
name
'Holy
Grail.'
Sophie
scrutinized
Langdon
in
the
back
of
the
taxi.
He's
joking.
"The
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon
nodded,
his
expression
serious.
"Holy
Grail
is
the
literal
meaning
of
Sangreal.
The
phrase
derives
from
the
French
Sangraal,
which
evolved
to
Sangreal,
and
was
eventually
split
into
two
words,
San
Great.
Holy
Grail.
Sophie
was
surprised
she
had
not
spotted
the
linguistic
ties
immediately.
Even
so,
Langdon's
claim
still
made
no
sense
to
her.
"I
thought
the
Holy
Grail
was
a
cup.
You
just
told
me
the
Sangreal
is
a
collection
of
documents
that
reveals
some
dark
secret."
"Yes,
but
the
Sangreal
documents
are
only
half
of
the
Holy
Grail
treasure.
They
are
buried
with
the
Grail
itself
and
reveal
its
true
meaning.
The
documents
gave
the
Knights
Templar
so
much
power
because
the
pages
revealed
the
true
nature
of
the
Grail."
The
true
nature
of
the
Grail?
Sophie
felt
even
more
lost
now.
The
Holy
Grail,
she
had
thought,
was
the
cup
that
Jesus
drank
from
at
the
Last
Supper
and
with
which
Joseph
of
Arimathea
later
caught
His
blood
at
the
crucifixion.
"The
Holy
Grail
is
the
Cup
of
Christ,"
she
said.
"How
much
simpler
could
it
be?"
"Sophie,"
Langdon
whispered,
leaning
toward
her
now,
"according
to
the
Priory
of
Sion,
the
Holy
Grail
is
not
a
cup
at
all.
They
claim
the
Grail
legend
that
of
a
chalice
is
actually
an
ingeniously
conceived
allegory.
That
is,
that
the
Grail
story
uses
the
chalice
as
a
metaphor
for
something
else,
something
far
more
powerful."
He
paused.
"Something
that
fits
perfectly
with
everything
your
grandfather
has
been
trying
to
tell
us
tonight,
including
all
his
symbologic
references
to
the
sacred
feminine."
Still
unsure,
Sophie
sensed
in
Langdon's
patient
smile
that
he
empathized
with
her
confusion,
and
yet
his
eyes
remained
earnest.
"But
if
the
Holy
Grail
is
not
a
cup,"
she
asked,
"what
is
it?"
Langdon
had
known
this
question
was
coming,
and
yet
he
still
felt
uncertain
exactly
how
to
tell
her.
If
he
did
not
present
the
answer
in
the
proper
historical
background,
Sophie
would
be
left
with
a
vacant
air
of
bewilderment
the
exact
expression
Langdon
had
seen
on
his
own
editor's
face
a
few
months
ago
after
Langdon
handed
him
a
draft
of
the
manuscript
he
was
working
on.
"This
manuscript
claims
what?"
his
editor
had
choked,
setting
down
his
wineglass
and
staring
across
his
half
eaten
power
lunch.
"You
can't
be
serious."
"Serious
enough
to
have
spent
a
year
researching
it."
Prominent
New
York
editor
Jonas
Faukman
tugged
nervously
at
his
goatee.
Faukman
no
doubt
had
heard
some
wild
book
ideas
in
his
illustrious
career,
but
this
one
seemed
to
have
left
the
man
flabbergasted.
"Robert,"
Faukman
finally
said,
"don't
get
me
wrong.
I
love
your
work,
and
we've
had
a
great
run
together.
But
if
I
agree
to
publish
an
idea
like
this,
I'll
have
people
picketing
outside
my
office
for
months.
Besides,
it
will
kill
your
reputation.
You're
a
Harvard
historian,
for
God's
sake,
not
a
pop
schlockmeister
looking
for
a
quick
buck.
Where
could
you
possibly
find
enough
credible
evidence
to
support
a
theory
like
this?"
With
a
quiet
smile
Langdon
pulled
a
piece
of
paper
from
the
pocket
of
his
tweed
coat
and
handed
it
to
Faukman.
The
page
listed
a
bibliography
of
over
fifty
titles
books
by
well
known
historians,
some
contemporary,
some
centuries
old
many
of
them
academic
bestsellers.
All
the
book
titles
suggested
the
same
premise
Langdon
had
just
proposed.
As
Faukman
read
down
the
list,
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
just
discovered
the
earth
was
actually
flat.
"I
know
some
of
these
authors.
They're
real
historians!"
Langdon
grinned.
"As
you
can
see,
Jonas,
this
is
not
only
my
theory.
It's
been
around
for
a
long
time.
I'm
simply
building
on
it.
No
book
has
yet
explored
the
legend
of
the
Holy
Grail
from
a
symbologic
angle.
The
iconographic
evidence
I'm
finding
to
support
the
theory
is,
well,
staggeringly
persuasive."
Faukman
was
still
staring
at
the
list.
"My
God,
one
of
these
books
was
written
by
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
a
British
Royal
Historian."
"Teabing
has
spent
much
of
his
life
studying
the
Holy
Grail.
I've
met
with
him.
He
was
actually
a
big
part
of
my
inspiration.
He's
a
believer,
Jonas,
along
with
all
of
the
others
on
that
list."
"You're
telling
me
all
of
these
historians
actually
believe"
Faukman
swallowed,
apparently
unable
to
say
the
words.
Langdon
grinned
again.
"The
Holy
Grail
is
arguably
the
most
sought
after
treasure
in
human
history.
The
Grail
has
spawned
legends,
wars,
and
lifelong
quests.
Does
it
make
sense
that
it
is
merely
a
cup?
If
so,
then
certainly
other
relics
should
generate
similar
or
greater
interest
the
Crown
of
Thorns,
the
True
Cross
of
the
Crucifixion,
the
Titulus
and
yet,
they
do
not.
Throughout
history,
the
Holy
Grail
has
been
the
most
special."
Langdon
grinned.
"Now
you
know
why."
Faukman
was
still
shaking
his
head.
"But
with
all
these
books
written
about
it,
why
isn't
this
theory
more
widely
known?"
"These
books
can't
possibly
compete
with
centuries
of
established
history,
especially
when
that
history
is
endorsed
by
the
ultimate
bestseller
of
all
time."
Faukman's
eyes
went
wide.
"Don't
tell
me
Harry
Potter
is
actually
about
the
Holy
Grail."
"I
was
referring
to
the
Bible."
Faukman
cringed.
"I
knew
that."
"Laissez
le!"
Sophie's
shouts
cut
the
air
inside
the
taxi.
"Put
it
down!"
Langdon
jumped
as
Sophie
leaned
forward
over
the
seat
and
yelled
at
the
taxi
driver.
Langdon
could
see
the
driver
was
clutching
his
radio
mouthpiece
and
speaking
into
it.
Sophie
turned
now
and
plunged
her
hand
into
the
pocket
of
Langdon's
tweed
jacket.
Before
Langdon
knew
what
had
happened,
she
had
yanked
out
the
pistol,
swung
it
around,
and
was
pressing
it
to
the
back
of
the
driver's
head.
The
driver
instantly
dropped
his
radio,
raising
his
one
free
hand
overhead.
"Sophie!"
Langdon
choked.
"What
the
hell"
"Arretez!
"
Sophie
commanded
the
driver.
Trembling,
the
driver
obeyed,
stopping
the
car
and
putting
it
in
park.
It
was
then
that
Langdon
heard
the
metallic
voice
of
the
taxi
company's
dispatcher
coming
from
the
dashboard,
"qui
s'appette
Agent
Sophie
Neveu"
the
radio
crackled.
"Et
un
Americain,
Robert
Langdon"
Langdon's
muscles
turned
rigid.
They
found
us
already?
"Descendez,
"
Sophie
demanded.
The
trembling
driver
kept
his
arms
over
his
head
as
he
got
out
of
his
taxi
and
took
several
steps
backward.
Sophie
had
rolled
down
her
window
and
now
aimed
the
gun
outside
at
the
bewildered
cabbie.
"Robert,"
she
said
quietly,
"take
the
wheel.
You're
driving."
Langdon
was
not
about
to
argue
with
a
woman
wielding
a
gun.
He
climbed
out
of
the
car
and
jumped
back
in
behind
the
wheel.
The
driver
was
yelling
curses,
his
arms
still
raised
over
his
head.
"Robert,"
Sophie
said
from
the
back
seat,
"I
trust
you've
seen
enough
of
our
magic
forest?"
He
nodded.
Plenty.
"Good.
Drive
us
out
of
here."
Langdon
looked
down
at
the
car's
controls
and
hesitated.
Shit.
He
groped
for
the
stick
shift
and
clutch.
"Sophie?
Maybe
you
"Go!"
she
yelled.
Outside,
several
hookers
were
walking
over
to
see
what
was
going
on.
One
woman
was
placing
a
call
on
her
cell
phone.
Langdon
depressed
the
clutch
and
jostled
the
stick
into
what
he
hoped
was
first
gear.
He
touched
the
accelerator,
testing
the
gas.
Langdon
popped
the
clutch.
The
tires
howled
as
the
taxi
leapt
forward,
fishtailing
wildly
and
sending
the
gathering
crowd
diving
for
cover.
The
woman
with
the
cell
phone
leapt
into
the
woods,
only
narrowly
avoiding
being
run
down.
"Doucement!"
Sophie
said,
as
the
car
lurched
down
the
road.
"What
are
you
doing?"
"I
tried
to
warn
you,"
he
shouted
over
the
sound
of
gnashing
gears.
"I
drive
an
automatic!"
Although
the
spartan
room
in
the
brownstone
on
Rue
La
Bruyere
had
witnessed
a
lot
of
suffering,
Silas
doubted
anything
could
match
the
anguish
now
gripping
his
pale
body.
was
deceived.
Everything
is
lost.
Silas
had
been
tricked.
The
brothers
had
lied,
choosing
death
instead
of
revealing
their
true
secret.
Silas
did
not
have
the
strength
to
call
the
Teacher.
Not
only
had
Silas
killed
the
only
four
people
who
knew
where
the
keystone
was
hidden,
he
had
killed
a
nun
inside
Saint
Sulpice.
She
was
working
against
God!
She
scorned
the
work
of
Opus
Dei!
A
crime
of
impulse,
the
woman's
death
complicated
matters
greatly.
Bishop
Aringarosa
had
placed
the
phone
call
that
got
Silas
into
Saint
Sulpice;
what
would
the
abbe
think
when
he
discovered
the
nun
was
dead?
Although
Silas
had
placed
her
back
in
her
bed,
the
wound
on
her
head
was
obvious.
Silas
had
attempted
to
replace
the
broken
tiles
in
the
floor,
but
that
damage
too
was
obvious.
They
would
know
someone
had
been
there.
Silas
had
planned
to
hide
within
Opus
Dei
when
his
task
here
was
complete.
Bishop
Aringarosa
will
protect
me.
Silas
could
imagine
no
more
blissful
existence
than
a
life
of
meditation
and
prayer
deep
within
the
walls
of
Opus
Dei's
headquarters
in
New
York
City.
He
would
never
again
set
foot
outside.
Everything
he
needed
was
within
that
sanctuary.
Nobody
will
miss
me.
Unfortunately,
Silas
knew,
a
prominent
man
like
Bishop
Aringarosa
could
not
disappear
so
easily.
have
endangered
the
bishop.
Silas
gazed
blankly
at
the
floor
and
pondered
taking
his
own
life.
After
all,
it
had
been
Aringarosa
who
gave
Silas
life
in
the
first
place
in
that
small
rectory
in
Spain,
educating
him,
giving
him
purpose.
"My
friend,"
Aringarosa
had
told
him,
"you
were
born
an
albino.
Do
not
let
others
shame
you
for
this.
Do
you
not
understand
how
special
this
makes
you?
Were
you
not
aware
that
Noah
himself
was
an
albino?"
"Noah
of
the
Ark?"
Silas
had
never
heard
this.
Aringarosa
was
smiling.
"Indeed,
Noah
of
the
Ark.
An
albino.
Like
you,
he
had
skin
white
like
an
angel.
Consider
this.
Noah
saved
all
of
life
on
the
planet.
You
are
destined
for
great
things,
Silas.
The
Lord
has
freed
you
for
a
reason.
You
have
your
calling.
The
Lord
needs
your
help
to
do
His
work."
Over
time,
Silas
learned
to
see
himself
in
a
new
light.
am
pure.
White.
Beautiful.
Like
an
angel.
At
the
moment,
though,
in
his
room
at
the
residence
hall,
it
was
his
father's
disappointed
voice
that
whispered
to
him
from
the
past.
Tu
es
un
desastre.
Un
spectre.
Kneeling
on
the
wooden
floor,
Silas
prayed
for
forgiveness.
Then,
stripping
off
his
robe,
he
reached
again
for
the
Discipline.
Struggling
with
the
gear
shift,
Langdon
managed
to
maneuver
the
hijacked
taxi
to
the
far
side
of
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
while
stalling
only
twice.
Unfortunately,
the
inherent
humor
in
the
situation
was
overshadowed
by
the
taxi
dispatcher
repeatedly
hailing
their
cab
over
the
radio.
"Voiture
cinq
six
trois.
Oil
etes
vous?
Repondez!"
When
Langdon
reached
the
exit
of
the
park,
he
swallowed
his
machismo
and
jammed
on
the
brakes.
"You'd
better
drive."
Sophie
looked
relieved
as
she
jumped
behind
the
wheel.
Within
seconds
she
had
the
car
humming
smoothly
westward
along
Allee
de
Longchamp,
leaving
the
Garden
of
Earthly
Delights
behind.
"Which
way
is
Rue
Haxo?"
Langdon
asked,
watching
Sophie
edge
the
speedometer
over
a
hundred
kilometers
an
hour.
Sophie's
eyes
remained
focused
on
the
road.
"The
cab
driver
said
it's
adjacent
to
the
Roland
Garros
tennis
stadium.
I
know
that
area."
Langdon
pulled
the
heavy
key
from
his
pocket
again,
feeling
the
weight
in
his
palm.
He
sensed
it
was
an
object
of
enormous
consequence.
Quite
possibly
the
key
to
his
own
freedom.
Earlier,
while
telling
Sophie
about
the
Knights
Templar,
Langdon
had
realized
that
this
key,
in
addition
to
having
the
Priory
seal
embossed
on
it,
possessed
a
more
subtle
tie
to
the
Priory
of
Sion.
The
equal
armed
cruciform
was
symbolic
of
balance
and
harmony
but
also
of
the
Knights
Templar.
Everyone
had
seen
the
paintings
of
Knights
Templar
wearing
white
tunics
emblazoned
with
red
equal
armed
crosses.
Granted,
the
arms
of
the
Templar
cross
were
slightly
flared
at
the
ends,
but
they
were
still
of
equal
length.
A
square
cross.
Just
like
the
one
on
this
key.
Langdon
felt
his
imagination
starting
to
run
wild
as
he
fantasized
about
what
they
might
find.
The
Holy
Grail.
He
almost
laughed
out
loud
at
the
absurdity
of
it.
The
Grail
was
believed
to
be
somewhere
in
England,
buried
in
a
hidden
chamber
beneath
one
of
the
many
Templar
churches,
where
it
had
been
hidden
since
at
least
1500.
The
era
of
Grand
Master
Da
Vinci.
The
Priory,
in
order
to
keep
their
powerful
documents
safe,
had
been
forced
to
move
them
many
times
in
the
early
centuries.
Historians
now
suspected
as
many
as
six
different
Grail
relocations
since
its
arrival
in
Europe
from
Jerusalem.
The
last
Grail
"sighting"
had
been
in
1447
when
numerous
eyewitnesses
described
a
fire
that
had
broken
out
and
almost
engulfed
the
documents
before
they
were
carried
to
safety
in
four
huge
chests
that
each
required
six
men
to
carry.
After
that,
nobody
claimed
to
see
the
Grail
ever
again.
All
that
remained
were
occasional
whisperings
that
it
was
hidden
in
Great
Britain,
the
land
of
King
Arthur
and
the
Knights
of
the
Round
Table.
Wherever
it
was,
two
important
facts
remained:
Leonardo
knew
where
the
Grail
resided
during
his
lifetime.
That
hiding
place
had
probably
not
changed
to
this
day.
For
this
reason,
Grail
enthusiasts
still
pored
over
Da
Vinci's
art
and
diaries
in
hopes
of
unearthing
a
hidden
clue
as
to
the
Grail's
current
location.
Some
claimed
the
mountainous
backdrop
in
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
matched
the
topography
of
a
series
of
cave
ridden
hills
in
Scotland.
Others
insisted
that
the
suspicious
placement
of
disciples
in
The
Last
Supper
was
some
kind
of
code.
Still
others
claimed
that
X
rays
of
the
Mona
Lisa
revealed
she
originally
had
been
painted
wearing
a
lapis
lazuli
pendant
of
Isis
a
detail
Da
Vinci
purportedly
later
decided
to
paint
over.
Langdon
had
never
seen
any
evidence
of
the
pendant,
nor
could
he
imagine
how
it
could
possibly
reveal
the
Holy
Grail,
and
yet
Grail
aficionados
still
discussed
it
ad
nauseum
on
Internet
bulletin
boards
and
worldwideweb
chat
rooms.
Everyone
loves
a
conspiracy.
And
the
conspiracies
kept
coming.
Most
recently,
of
course,
had
been
the
earthshaking
discovery
that
Da
Vinci's
famed
Adoration
of
the
Magi
was
hiding
a
dark
secret
beneath
its
layers
of
paint.
Italian
art
diagnostician
Maurizio
Seracini
had
unveiled
the
unsettling
truth,
which
the
New
York
Times
Magazine
carried
prominently
in
a
story
titled
"The
Leonardo
Cover
Up."
Seracini
had
revealed
beyond
any
doubt
that
while
the
Adoration's
gray
green
sketched
underdrawing
was
indeed
Da
Vinci's
work,
the
painting
itself
was
not.
The
truth
was
that
some
anonymous
painter
had
filled
in
Da
Vinci's
sketch
like
a
paint
by
numbers
years
after
Da
Vinci's
death.
Far
more
troubling,
however,
was
what
lay
beneath
the
impostor's
paint.
Photographs
taken
with
infrared
reflectography
and
X
ray
suggested
that
this
rogue
painter,
while
filling
in
Da
Vinci's
sketched
study,
had
made
suspicious
departures
from
the
underdrawing
as
if
to
subvert
Da
Vinci's
true
intention.
Whatever
the
true
nature
of
the
underdrawing,
it
had
yet
to
be
made
public.
Even
so,
embarrassed
officials
at
Florence's
Uffizi
Gallery
immediately
banished
the
painting
to
a
warehouse
across
the
street.
Visitors
at
the
gallery's
Leonardo
Room
now
found
a
misleading
and
unapologetic
plaque
where
the
Adoration
once
hung.
THIS
WORK
IS
UNDERGOING
DIAGNOSTIC
TESTS
IN
PREPARATION
FOR
RESTORATION.
In
the
bizarre
underworld
of
modern
Grail
seekers,
Leonardo
da
Vinci
remained
the
quest's
great
enigma.
His
artwork
seemed
bursting
to
tell
a
secret,
and
yet
whatever
it
was
remained
hidden,
perhaps
beneath
a
layer
of
paint,
perhaps
enciphered
in
plain
view,
or
perhaps
nowhere
at
all.
Maybe
Da
Vinci's
plethora
of
tantalizing
clues
was
nothing
but
an
empty
promise
left
behind
to
frustrate
the
curious
and
bring
a
smirk
to
the
face
of
his
knowing
Mona
Lisa.
"Is
it
possible,"
Sophie
asked,
drawing
Langdon
back,
"that
the
key
you're
holding
unlocks
the
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon's
laugh
sounded
forced,
even
to
him.
"I
really
can't
imagine.
Besides,
the
Grail
is
believed
to
be
hidden
in
the
United
Kingdom
somewhere,
not
France."
He
gave
her
the
quick
history.
"But
the
Grail
seems
the
only
rational
conclusion,"
she
insisted.
"We
have
an
extremely
secure
key,
stamped
with
the
Priory
of
Sion
seal,
delivered
to
us
by
a
member
of
the
Priory
of
Sion
a
brotherhood
which,
you
just
told
me,
are
guardians
of
the
Holy
Grail."
Langdon
knew
her
contention
was
logical,
and
yet
intuitively
he
could
not
possibly
accept
it.
Rumors
existed
that
the
Priory
had
vowed
someday
to
bring
the
Grail
back
to
France
to
a
final
resting
place,
but
certainly
no
historical
evidence
existed
to
suggest
that
this
indeed
had
happened.
Even
if
the
Priory
had
managed
to
bring
the
Grail
back
to
France,
the
address
24
Rue
Haxo
near
a
tennis
stadium
hardly
sounded
like
a
noble
final
resting
place.
"Sophie,
I
really
don't
see
how
this
key
could
have
anything
to
do
with
the
Grail."
"Because
the
Grail
is
supposed
to
be
in
England?"
"Not
only
that.
The
location
of
the
Holy
Grail
is
one
of
the
best
kept
secrets
in
history.
Priory
members
wait
decades
proving
themselves
trustworthy
before
being
elevated
to
the
highest
echelons
of
the
fraternity
and
learning
where
the
Grail
is.
That
secret
is
protected
by
an
intricate
system
of
compartmentalized
knowledge,
and
although
the
Priory
brotherhood
is
very
large,
only
four
members
at
any
given
time
know
where
the
Grail
is
hidden
the
Grand
Master
and
his
three
senechaux.
The
probability
of
your
grandfather
being
one
of
those
four
top
people
is
very
slim."
My
grandfather
was
one
of
them,
Sophie
thought,
pressing
down
on
the
accelerator.
She
had
an
image
stamped
in
her
memory
that
confirmed
her
grandfather's
status
within
the
brotherhood
beyond
any
doubt.
"And
even
if
your
grandfather
were
in
the
upper
echelon,
he
would
never
be
allowed
to
reveal
anything
to
anyone
outside
the
brotherhood.
It
is
inconceivable
that
he
would
bring
you
into
the
inner
circle."
I've
already
been
there,
Sophie
thought,
picturing
the
ritual
in
the
basement.
She
wondered
if
this
were
the
moment
to
tell
Langdon
what
she
had
witnessed
that
night
in
the
Normandy
chateau.
For
ten
years
now,
simple
shame
had
kept
her
from
telling
a
soul.
Just
thinking
about
it,
she
shuddered.
Sirens
howled
somewhere
in
the
distance,
and
she
felt
a
thickening
shroud
of
fatigue
settling
over
her.
"There!"
Langdon
said,
feeling
excited
to
see
the
huge
complex
of
the
Roland
Garros
tennis
stadium
looming
ahead.
Sophie
snaked
her
way
toward
the
stadium.
After
several
passes,
they
located
the
intersection
of
Rue
Haxo
and
turned
onto
it,
driving
in
the
direction
of
the
lower
numbers.
The
road
became
more
industrial,
lined
with
businesses.
We
need
number
twenty
four,
Langdon
told
himself,
realizing
he
was
secretly
scanning
the
horizon
for
the
spires
of
a
church.
Don't
be
ridiculous.
A
forgotten
Templar
church
in
this
neighborhood?
"There
it
is,"
Sophie
exclaimed,
pointing.
Langdon's
eyes
followed
to
the
structure
ahead.
What
in
the
world?
The
building
was
modern.
A
squat
citadel
with
a
giant,
neon
equal
armed
cross
emblazoned
atop
its
facade.
Beneath
the
cross
were
the
words:
DEPOSITORY
BANK
OF
ZURICH
Langdon
was
thankful
not
to
have
shared
his
Templar
church
hopes
with
Sophie.
A
career
hazard
of
symbologists
was
a
tendency
to
extract
hidden
meaning
from
situations
that
had
none.
In
this
case,
Langdon
had
entirely
forgotten
that
the
peaceful,
equal
armed
cross
had
been
adopted
as
the
perfect
symbol
for
the
flag
of
neutral
Switzerland.
At
least
the
mystery
was
solved.
Sophie
and
Langdon
were
holding
the
key
to
a
Swiss
bank
deposit
box.
Outside
Castel
Gandolfo,
an
updraft
of
mountain
air
gushed
over
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
across
the
high
bluff,
sending
a
chill
through
Bishop
Aringarosa
as
he
stepped
from
the
Fiat.
should
have
worn
more
than
this
cassock,
he
thought,
fighting
the
reflex
to
shiver.
The
last
thing
he
needed
to
appear
tonight
was
weak
or
fearful.
The
castle
was
dark
save
the
windows
at
the
very
top
of
the
building,
which
glowed
ominously.
The
library,
Aringarosa
thought.
They
are
awake
and
waiting.
He
ducked
his
head
against
the
wind
and
continued
on
without
so
much
as
a
glance
toward
the
observatory
domes.
The
priest
who
greeted
him
at
the
door
looked
sleepy.
He
was
the
same
priest
who
had
greeted
Aringarosa
five
months
ago,
albeit
tonight
he
did
so
with
much
less
hospitality.
"We
were
worried
about
you,
Bishop,"
the
priest
said,
checking
his
watch
and
looking
more
perturbed
than
worried.
"My
apologies.
Airlines
are
so
unreliable
these
days."
The
priest
mumbled
something
inaudible
and
then
said,
"They
are
waiting
upstairs.
I
will
escort
you
up."
The
library
was
a
vast
square
room
with
dark
wood
from
floor
to
ceiling.
On
all
sides,
towering
bookcases
burgeoned
with
volumes.
The
floor
was
amber
marble
with
black
basalt
trim,
a
handsome
reminder
that
this
building
had
once
been
a
palace.
"Welcome,
Bishop,"
a
man's
voice
said
from
across
the
room.
Aringarosa
tried
to
see
who
had
spoken,
but
the
lights
were
ridiculously
low
much
lower
than
they
had
been
on
his
first
visit,
when
everything
was
ablaze.
The
night
of
stark
awakening.
Tonight,
these
men
sat
in
the
shadows,
as
if
they
were
somehow
ashamed
of
what
was
about
to
transpire.
Aringarosa
entered
slowly,
regally
even.
He
could
see
the
shapes
of
three
men
at
a
long
table
on
the
far
side
of
the
room.
The
silhouette
of
the
man
in
the
middle
was
immediately
recognizable
the
obese
Secretariat
Vaticana,
overlord
of
all
legal
matters
within
Vatican
City.
The
other
two
were
high
ranking
Italian
cardinals.
Aringarosa
crossed
the
library
toward
them.
"My
humble
apologies
for
the
hour.
We're
on
different
time
zones.
You
must
be
tired."
"Not
at
all,"
the
secretariat
said,
his
hands
folded
on
his
enormous
belly.
"We
are
grateful
you
have
come
so
far.
The
least
we
can
do
is
be
awake
to
meet
you.
Can
we
offer
you
some
coffee
or
refreshments?"
"I'd
prefer
we
don't
pretend
this
is
a
social
visit.
I
have
another
plane
to
catch.
Shall
we
get
to
business?"
"Of
course,"
the
secretariat
said.
"You
have
acted
more
quickly
than
we
imagined."
"Have
I?"
"You
still
have
a
month."
"You
made
your
concerns
known
five
months
ago,"
Aringarosa
said.
"Why
should
I
wait?"
"Indeed.
We
are
very
pleased
with
your
expediency."
Aringarosa's
eyes
traveled
the
length
of
the
long
table
to
a
large
black
briefcase.
"Is
that
what
I
requested?"
"It
is."
The
secretariat
sounded
uneasy.
"Although,
I
must
admit,
we
are
concerned
with
the
request.
It
seems
quite"
"Dangerous,"
one
of
the
cardinals
finished.
"Are
you
certain
we
cannot
wire
it
to
you
somewhere?
The
sum
is
exorbitant."
Freedom
is
expensive.
"I
have
no
concerns
for
my
own
safety.
God
is
with
me."
The
men
actually
looked
doubtful.
"The
funds
are
exactly
as
I
requested?"
The
secretariat
nodded.
"Large
denomination
bearer
bonds
drawn
on
the
Vatican
Bank.
Negotiable
as
cash
anywhere
in
the
world."
Aringarosa
walked
to
the
end
of
the
table
and
opened
the
briefcase.
Inside
were
two
thick
stacks
of
bonds,
each
embossed
with
the
Vatican
seal
and
the
title
PORTATORE,
making
the
bonds
redeemable
to
whoever
was
holding
them.
The
secretariat
looked
tense.
"I
must
say,
Bishop,
all
of
us
would
feel
less
apprehensive
if
these
funds
were
in
cash.
I
could
not
lift
that
much
cash,
Aringarosa
thought,
closing
the
case.
"Bonds
are
negotiable
as
cash.
You
said
so
yourself.
The
cardinals
exchanged
uneasy
looks,
and
finally
one
said,
"Yes,
but
these
bonds
are
traceable
directly
to
the
Vatican
Bank."
Aringarosa
smiled
inwardly.
That
was
precisely
the
reason
the
Teacher
suggested
Aringarosa
get
the
money
in
Vatican
Bank
bonds.
It
served
as
insurance.
We
are
all
in
this
together
now.
"This
is
a
perfectly
legal
transaction,"
Aringarosa
defended.
"Opus
Dei
is
a
personal
prelature
of
Vatican
City,
and
His
Holiness
can
disperse
monies
however
he
sees
fit.
No
law
has
been
broken
here."
"True,
and
yet"
The
secretariat
leaned
forward
and
his
chair
creaked
under
the
burden.
"We
have
no
knowledge
of
what
you
intend
to
do
with
these
funds,
and
if
it
is
in
any
way
illegal"
"Considering
what
you
are
asking
of
me,"
Aringarosa
countered,
"what
I
do
with
this
money
is
not
your
concern.
There
was
a
long
silence.
They
know
I'm
right,
Aringarosa
thought.
"Now,
I
imagine
you
have
something
for
me
to
sign?"
They
all
jumped,
eagerly
pushing
the
paper
toward
him,
as
if
they
wished
he
would
simply
leave.
Aringarosa
eyed
the
sheet
before
him.
It
bore
the
papal
seal.
"This
is
identical
to
the
copy
you
sent
me?"
"Exactly."
Aringarosa
was
surprised
how
little
emotion
he
felt
as
he
signed
the
document.
The
three
men
present,
however,
seemed
to
sigh
in
relief.
"Thank
you,
Bishop,"
the
secretariat
said.
"Your
service
to
the
Church
will
never
be
forgotten."
Aringarosa
picked
up
the
briefcase,
sensing
promise
and
authority
in
its
weight.
The
four
men
looked
at
one
another
for
a
moment
as
if
there
were
something
more
to
say,
but
apparently
there
was
not.
Aringarosa
turned
and
headed
for
the
door.
"Bishop?"
one
of
the
cardinals
called
out
as
Aringarosa
reached
the
threshold.
Aringarosa
paused,
turning.
"Yes?"
"Where
will
you
go
from
here?"
Aringarosa
sensed
the
query
was
more
spiritual
than
geographical,
and
yet
he
had
no
intention
of
discussing
morality
at
this
hour.
"Paris,"
he
said,
and
walked
out
the
door.
The
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
was
a
twenty
four
hour
Geldschrank
bank
offering
the
full
modern
array
of
anonymous
services
in
the
tradition
of
the
Swiss
numbered
account.
Maintaining
offices
in
Zurich,
Kuala
Lumpur,
New
York,
and
Paris,
the
bank
had
expanded
its
services
in
recent
years
to
offer
anonymous
computer
source
code
escrow
services
and
faceless
digitized
backup.
The
bread
and
butter
of
its
operation
was
by
far
its
oldest
and
simplest
offering
the
anonyme
Lager
blind
drop
services,
otherwise
known
as
anonymous
safe
deposit
boxes.
Clients
wishing
to
store
anything
from
stock
certificates
to
valuable
paintings
could
deposit
their
belongings
anonymously,
through
a
series
of
high
tech
veils
of
privacy,
withdrawing
items
at
any
time,
also
in
total
anonymity.
As
Sophie
pulled
the
taxi
to
a
stop
in
front
of
their
destination,
Langdon
gazed
out
at
the
building's
uncompromising
architecture
and
sensed
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
was
a
firm
with
little
sense
of
humor.
The
building
was
a
windowless
rectangle
that
seemed
to
be
forged
entirely
of
dull
steel.
Resembling
an
enormous
metal
brick,
the
edifice
sat
back
from
the
road
with
a
fifteen
foot
tall,
neon,
equilateral
cross
glowing
over
its
facade.
Switzerland's
reputation
for
secrecy
in
banking
had
become
one
of
the
country's
most
lucrative
exports.
Facilities
like
this
had
become
controversial
in
the
art
community
because
they
provided
a
perfect
place
for
art
thieves
to
hide
stolen
goods,
for
years
if
necessary,
until
the
heat
was
off.
Because
deposits
were
protected
from
police
inspection
by
privacy
laws
and
were
attached
to
numbered
accounts
rather
than
people's
names,
thieves
could
rest
easily
knowing
their
stolen
goods
were
safe
and
could
never
be
traced
to
them.
Sophie
stopped
the
taxi
at
an
imposing
gate
that
blocked
the
bank's
driveway
a
cement
lined
ramp
that
descended
beneath
the
building.
A
video
camera
overhead
was
aimed
directly
at
them,
and
Langdon
had
the
feeling
that
this
camera,
unlike
those
at
the
Louvre,
was
authentic.
Sophie
rolled
down
the
window
and
surveyed
the
electronic
podium
on
the
driver's
side.
An
LCD
screen
provided
directions
in
seven
languages.
Topping
the
list
was
English.
INSERT
KEY.
Sophie
took
the
gold
laser
pocked
key
from
her
pocket
and
turned
her
attention
back
to
the
podium.
Below
the
screen
was
a
triangular
hole.
"Something
tells
me
it
will
fit,"
Langdon
said.
Sophie
aligned
the
key's
triangular
shaft
with
the
hole
and
inserted
it,
sliding
it
in
until
the
entire
shaft
had
disappeared.
This
key
apparently
required
no
turning.
Instantly,
the
gate
began
to
swing
open.
Sophie
took
her
foot
off
the
brake
and
coasted
down
to
a
second
gate
and
podium.
Behind
her,
the
first
gate
closed,
trapping
them
like
a
ship
in
a
lock.
Langdon
disliked
the
constricted
sensation.
Let's
hope
this
second
gate
works
too.
This
second
podium
bore
familiar
directions.
INSERT
KEY.
When
Sophie
inserted
the
key,
the
second
gate
immediately
opened.
Moments
later
they
were
winding
down
the
ramp
into
the
belly
of
the
structure.
The
private
garage
was
small
and
dim,
with
spaces
for
about
a
dozen
cars.
At
the
far
end,
Langdon
spied
the
building's
main
entrance.
A
red
carpet
stretched
across
the
cement
floor,
welcoming
visitors
to
a
huge
door
that
appeared
to
be
forged
of
solid
metal.
Talk
about
mixed
messages,
Langdon
thought.
Welcome
and
keep
out.
Sophie
pulled
the
taxi
into
a
parking
space
near
the
entrance
and
killed
the
engine.
"You'd
better
leave
the
gun
here."
With
pleasure,
Langdon
thought,
sliding
the
pistol
under
the
seat.
Sophie
and
Langdon
got
out
and
walked
up
the
red
carpet
toward
the
slab
of
steel.
The
door
had
no
handle,
but
on
the
wall
beside
it
was
another
triangular
keyhole.
No
directions
were
posted
this
time.
"Keeps
out
the
slow
learners,"
Langdon
said.
Sophie
laughed,
looking
nervous.
"Here
we
go."
She
stuck
the
key
in
the
hole,
and
the
door
swung
inward
with
a
low
hum.
Exchanging
glances,
Sophie
and
Langdon
entered.
The
door
shut
with
a
thud
behind
them.
The
foyer
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
employed
as
imposing
a
decor
as
any
Langdon
had
ever
seen.
Where
most
banks
were
content
with
the
usual
polished
marble
and
granite,
this
one
had
opted
for
wall
to
wall
metal
and
rivets.
Who's
their
decorator?
Langdon
wondered.
Allied
Steel?
Sophie
looked
equally
intimidated
as
her
eyes
scanned
the
lobby.
The
gray
metal
was
everywhere
the
floor,
walls,
counters,
doors,
even
the
lobby
chairs
appeared
to
be
fashioned
of
molded
iron.
Nonetheless,
the
effect
was
impressive.
The
message
was
clear:
You
are
walking
into
a
vault.
A
large
man
behind
the
counter
glanced
up
as
they
entered.
He
turned
off
the
small
television
he
was
watching
and
greeted
them
with
a
pleasant
smile.
Despite
his
enormous
muscles
and
visible
sidearm,
his
diction
chimed
with
the
polished
courtesy
of
a
Swiss
bellhop.
"Bonsoir,
"
he
said.
"How
may
I
help
you?"
The
dual
language
greeting
was
the
newest
hospitality
trick
of
the
European
host.
It
presumed
nothing
and
opened
the
door
for
the
guest
to
reply
in
whichever
language
was
more
comfortable.
Sophie
replied
with
neither.
She
simply
laid
the
gold
key
on
the
counter
in
front
of
the
man.
The
man
glanced
down
and
immediately
stood
straighter.
"Of
course.
Your
elevator
is
at
the
end
of
the
hall.
I
will
alert
someone
that
you
are
on
your
way."
Sophie
nodded
and
took
her
key
back.
"Which
floor?"
The
man
gave
her
an
odd
look.
"Your
key
instructs
the
elevator
which
floor."
She
smiled.
"Ah,
yes."
The
guard
watched
as
the
two
newcomers
made
their
way
to
the
elevators,
inserted
their
key,
boarded
the
lift,
and
disappeared.
As
soon
as
the
door
had
closed,
he
grabbed
the
phone.
He
was
not
calling
to
alert
anyone
of
their
arrival;
there
was
no
need
for
that.
A
vault
greeter
already
had
been
alerted
automatically
when
the
client's
key
was
inserted
outside
in
the
entry
gate.
Instead,
the
guard
was
calling
the
bank's
night
manager.
As
the
line
rang,
the
guard
switched
the
television
back
on
and
stared
at
it.
The
news
story
he
had
been
watching
was
just
ending.
It
didn't
matter.
He
got
another
look
at
the
two
faces
on
the
television.
The
manager
answered.
"Oui?"
"We
have
a
situation
down
here."
"What's
happening?"
the
manager
demanded.
"The
French
police
are
tracking
two
fugitives
tonight."
"So?"
"Both
of
them
just
walked
into
our
bank."
The
manager
cursed
quietly.
"Okay.
I'll
contact
Monsieur
Vernet
immediately."
The
guard
then
hung
up
and
placed
a
second
call.
This
one
to
Interpol.
Langdon
was
surprised
to
feel
the
elevator
dropping
rather
than
climbing.
He
had
no
idea
how
many
floors
they
had
descended
beneath
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
before
the
door
finally
opened.
He
didn't
care.
He
was
happy
to
be
out
of
the
elevator.
Displaying
impressive
alacrity,
a
host
was
already
standing
there
to
greet
them.
He
was
elderly
and
pleasant,
wearing
a
neatly
pressed
flannel
suit
that
made
him
look
oddly
out
of
place
an
old
world
banker
in
a
high
tech
world.
"Bonsoir,
"
the
man
said.
"Good
evening.
Would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
follow
me,
s'il
vous
plait?"
Without
waiting
for
a
response,
he
spun
on
his
heel
and
strode
briskly
down
a
narrow
metal
corridor.
Langdon
walked
with
Sophie
down
a
series
of
corridors,
past
several
large
rooms
filled
with
blinking
mainframe
computers.
"Void,
"
their
host
said,
arriving
at
a
steel
door
and
opening
it
for
them.
"Here
you
are."
Langdon
and
Sophie
stepped
into
another
world.
The
small
room
before
them
looked
like
a
lavish
sitting
room
at
a
fine
hotel.
Gone
were
the
metal
and
rivets,
replaced
with
oriental
carpets,
dark
oak
furniture,
and
cushioned
chairs.
On
the
broad
desk
in
the
middle
of
the
room,
two
crystal
glasses
sat
beside
an
opened
bottle
of
Perrier,
its
bubbles
still
fizzing.
A
pewter
pot
of
coffee
steamed
beside
it.
Clockwork,
Langdon
thought.
Leave
it
to
the
Swiss.
The
man
gave
a
perceptive
smile.
"I
sense
this
is
your
first
visit
to
us?"
Sophie
hesitated
and
then
nodded.
"Understood.
Keys
are
often
passed
on
as
inheritance,
and
our
first
time
users
are
invariably
uncertain
of
the
protocol."
He
motioned
to
the
table
of
drinks.
"This
room
is
yours
as
long
as
you
care
to
use
it."
"You
say
keys
are
sometimes
inherited?"
Sophie
asked.
"Indeed.
Your
key
is
like
a
Swiss
numbered
account,
which
are
often
willed
through
generations.
On
our
gold
accounts,
the
shortest
safety
deposit
box
lease
is
fifty
years.
Paid
in
advance.
So
we
see
plenty
of
family
turnover.
Langdon
stared.
"Did
you
say
fifty
years?"
"At
a
minimum,"
their
host
replied.
"Of
course,
you
can
purchase
much
longer
leases,
but
barring
further
arrangements,
if
there
is
no
activity
on
an
account
for
fifty
years,
the
contents
of
that
safe
deposit
box
are
automatically
destroyed.
Shall
I
run
through
the
process
of
accessing
your
box?"
Sophie
nodded.
"Please."
Their
host
swept
an
arm
across
the
luxurious
salon.
"This
is
your
private
viewing
room.
Once
I
leave
the
room,
you
may
spend
all
the
time
you
need
in
here
to
review
and
modify
the
contents
of
your
safe
deposit
box,
which
arrives
over
here."
He
walked
them
to
the
far
wall
where
a
wide
conveyor
belt
entered
the
room
in
a
graceful
curve,
vaguely
resembling
a
baggage
claim
carousel.
"You
insert
your
key
in
that
slot
there."
The
man
pointed
to
a
large
electronic
podium
facing
the
conveyor
belt.
The
podium
had
a
familiar
triangular
hole.
"Once
the
computer
confirms
the
markings
on
your
key,
you
enter
your
account
number,
and
your
safe
deposit
box
will
be
retrieved
robotically
from
the
vault
below
for
your
inspection.
When
you
are
finished
with
your
box,
you
place
it
back
on
the
conveyor
belt,
insert
your
key
again,
and
the
process
is
reversed.
Because
everything
is
automated,
your
privacy
is
guaranteed,
even
from
the
staff
of
this
bank.
If
you
need
anything
at
all,
simply
press
the
call
button
on
the
table
in
the
center
of
the
room."
Sophie
was
about
to
ask
a
question
when
a
telephone
rang.
The
man
looked
puzzled
and
embarrassed.
"Excuse
me,
please."
He
walked
over
to
the
phone,
which
was
sitting
on
the
table
beside
the
coffee
and
Perrier.
"Oui?"
he
answered.
His
brow
furrowed
as
he
listened
to
the
caller.
"Oui
oui
d'
accord.
"
He
hung
up,
and
gave
them
an
uneasy
smile.
"I'm
sorry,
I
must
leave
you
now.
Make
yourselves
at
home."
He
moved
quickly
toward
the
door.
"Excuse
me,"
Sophie
called.
"Could
you
clarify
something
before
you
go?
You
mentioned
that
we
enter
an
account
number?"
The
man
paused
at
the
door,
looking
pale.
"But
of
course.
Like
most
Swiss
banks,
our
safe
deposit
boxes
are
attached
to
a
number,
not
a
name.
You
have
a
key
and
a
personal
account
number
known
only
to
you.
Your
key
is
only
half
of
your
identification.
Your
personal
account
number
is
the
other
half.
Otherwise,
if
you
lost
your
key,
anyone
could
use
it."
Sophie
hesitated.
"And
if
my
benefactor
gave
me
no
account
number?"
The
banker's
heart
pounded.
Then
you
obviously
have
no
business
here!
He
gave
them
a
calm
smile.
"I
will
ask
someone
to
help
you.
He
will
be
in
shortly."
Leaving,
the
banker
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
twisted
a
heavy
lock,
sealing
them
inside.
Across
town,
Collet
was
standing
in
the
Gare
du
Nord
train
terminal
when
his
phone
rang.
It
was
Fache.
"Interpol
got
a
tip,"
he
said.
"Forget
the
train.
Langdon
and
Neveu
just
walked
into
the
Paris
branch
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich.
I
want
your
men
over
there
right
away."
"Any
leads
yet
on
what
Sauniere
was
trying
to
tell
Agent
Neveu
and
Robert
Langdon?"
Fache's
tone
was
cold.
"If
you
arrest
them,
Lieutenant
Collet,
then
I
can
ask
them
personally."
Collet
took
the
hint.
"Twenty
four
Rue
Haxo.
Right
away,
Captain."
He
hung
up
and
radioed
his
men.
Andre
Vernet
president
of
the
Paris
branch
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
lived
in
a
lavish
flat
above
the
bank.
Despite
his
plush
accommodations,
he
had
always
dreamed
of
owning
a
riverside
apartment
on
L'lle
Saint
Louis,
where
he
could
rub
shoulders
with
the
true
cognoscenti,
rather
than
here,
where
he
simply
met
the
filthy
rich.
When
I
retire,
Vernet
told
himself,
will
fill
my
cellar
with
rare
Bordeaux,
adorn
my
salon
with
a
Fragonard
and
perhaps
a
Boucher,
and
spend
my
days
hunting
for
antique
furniture
and
rare
books
in
the
Quartier
Latin.
Tonight,
Vernet
had
been
awake
only
six
and
a
half
minutes.
Even
so,
as
he
hurried
through
the
bank's
underground
corridor,
he
looked
as
if
his
personal
tailor
and
hairdresser
had
polished
him
to
a
fine
sheen.
Impeccably
dressed
in
a
silk
suit,
Vernet
sprayed
some
breath
spray
in
his
mouth
and
tightened
his
tie
as
he
walked.
No
stranger
to
being
awoken
to
attend
to
his
international
clients
arriving
from
different
time
zones,
Vernet
modeled
his
sleep
habits
after
the
Maasai
warriors
the
African
tribe
famous
for
their
ability
to
rise
from
the
deepest
sleep
to
a
state
of
total
battle
readiness
in
a
matter
of
seconds.
Battle
ready,
Vernet
thought,
fearing
the
comparison
might
be
uncharacteristically
apt
tonight.
The
arrival
of
a
gold
key
client
always
required
an
extra
flurry
of
attention,
but
the
arrival
of
a
gold
key
client
who
was
wanted
by
the
Judicial
Police
would
be
an
extremely
delicate
matter.
The
bank
had
enough
battles
with
law
enforcement
over
the
privacy
rights
of
their
clients
without
proof
that
some
of
them
were
criminals.
Five
minutes,
Vernet
told
himself.
need
these
people
out
of
my
bank
before
the
police
arrive.
If
he
moved
quickly,
this
impending
disaster
could
be
deftly
sidestepped.
Vernet
could
tell
the
police
that
the
fugitives
in
question
had
indeed
walked
into
his
bank
as
reported,
but
because
they
were
not
clients
and
had
no
account
number,
they
were
turned
away.
He
wished
the
damned
watchman
had
not
called
Interpol.
Discretion
was
apparently
not
part
of
the
vocabulary
of
a
15
euro
per
hour
watchman.
Stopping
at
the
doorway,
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
loosened
his
muscles.
Then,
forcing
a
balmy
smile,
he
unlocked
the
door
and
swirled
into
the
room
like
a
warm
breeze.
"Good
evening,"
he
said,
his
eyes
finding
his
clients.
"I
am
Andre
Vernet.
How
can
I
be
of
serv
The
rest
of
the
sentence
lodged
somewhere
beneath
his
Adam's
apple.
The
woman
before
him
was
as
unexpected
a
visitor
as
Vernet
had
ever
had.
"I'm
sorry,
do
we
know
each
other?"
Sophie
asked.
She
did
not
recognize
the
banker,
but
he
for
a
moment
looked
as
if
he'd
seen
a
ghost.
"No,"
the
bank
president
fumbled.
"I
don't
believe
so.
Our
services
are
anonymous."
He
exhaled
and
forced
a
calm
smile.
"My
assistant
tells
me
you
have
a
gold
key
but
no
account
number?
Might
I
ask
how
you
came
by
this
key?"
"My
grandfather
gave
it
to
me,"
Sophie
replied,
watching
the
man
closely.
His
uneasiness
seemed
more
evident
now.
"Really?
Your
grandfather
gave
you
the
key
but
failed
to
give
you
the
account
number?"
"I
don't
think
he
had
time,"
Sophie
said.
"He
was
murdered
tonight."
Her
words
sent
the
man
staggering
backward.
"Jacques
Sauniere
is
dead?"
he
demanded,
his
eyes
filling
with
horror.
"But
how?!"
Now
it
was
Sophie
who
reeled,
numb
with
shock.
"You
knew
my
grandfather?"
Banker
Andre
Vernet
looked
equally
astounded,
steadying
himself
by
leaning
on
an
end
table.
"Jacques
and
I
were
dear
friends.
When
did
this
happen?"
"Earlier
this
evening.
Inside
the
Louvre."
Vernet
walked
to
a
deep
leather
chair
and
sank
into
it.
"I
need
to
ask
you
both
a
very
important
question."
He
glanced
up
at
Langdon
and
then
back
to
Sophie.
"Did
either
of
you
have
anything
to
do
with
his
death?"
"No!"
Sophie
declared.
"Absolutely
not."
Vernet's
face
was
grim,
and
he
paused,
pondering.
"Your
pictures
are
being
circulated
by
Interpol.
This
is
how
I
recognized
you.
You're
wanted
for
a
murder."
Sophie
slumped.
Fache
ran
an
Interpol
broadcast
already?
It
seemed
the
captain
was
more
motivated
than
Sophie
had
anticipated.
She
quickly
told
Vernet
who
Langdon
was
and
what
had
happened
inside
the
Louvre
tonight.
Vernet
looked
amazed.
"And
as
your
grandfather
was
dying,
he
left
you
a
message
telling
you
to
find
Mr.
Langdon?"
"Yes.
And
this
key."
Sophie
laid
the
gold
key
on
the
coffee
table
in
front
of
Vernet,
placing
the
Priory
seal
face
down.
Vernet
glanced
at
the
key
but
made
no
move
to
touch
it.
"He
left
you
only
this
key?
Nothing
else?
No
slip
of
paper?"
Sophie
knew
she
had
been
in
a
hurry
inside
the
Louvre,
but
she
was
certain
she
had
seen
nothing
else
behind
Madonna
of
the
Rocks.
"No.
Just
the
key."
Vernet
gave
a
helpless
sigh.
"I'm
afraid
every
key
is
electronically
paired
with
a
ten
digit
account
number
that
functions
as
a
password.
Without
that
number,
your
key
is
worthless."
Ten
digits.
Sophie
reluctantly
calculated
the
cryptographic
odds.
Over
ten
billion
possible
choices.
Even
if
she
could
bring
in
DCPJ's
most
powerful
parallel
processing
computers,
she
still
would
need
weeks
to
break
the
code.
"Certainly,
monsieur,
considering
the
circumstances,
you
can
help
us."
"I'm
sorry.
I
truly
can
do
nothing.
Clients
select
their
own
account
numbers
via
a
secure
terminal,
meaning
account
numbers
are
known
only
to
the
client
and
computer.
This
is
one
way
we
ensure
anonymity.
And
the
safety
of
our
employees."
Sophie
understood.
Convenience
stores
did
the
same
thing.
EMPLOYEES
DO
NOT
HAVE
KEYS
TO
THE
SAFE.
This
bank
obviously
did
not
want
to
risk
someone
stealing
a
key
and
then
holding
an
employee
hostage
for
the
account
number.
Sophie
sat
down
beside
Langdon,
glanced
down
at
the
key
and
then
up
at
Vernet.
"Do
you
have
any
idea
what
my
grandfather
is
storing
in
your
bank?"
"None
whatsoever.
That
is
the
definition
of
a
Geldschrank
bank."
"Monsieur
Vernet,"
she
pressed,
"our
time
tonight
is
short.
I
am
going
to
be
very
direct
if
I
may."
She
reached
out
to
the
gold
key
and
flipped
it
over,
watching
the
man's
eyes
as
she
revealed
the
Priory
of
Sion
seal.
"Does
the
symbol
on
this
key
mean
anything
to
you?"
Vernet
glanced
down
at
the
fleur
de
lis
seal
and
made
no
reaction.
"No,
but
many
of
our
clients
emboss
corporate
logos
or
initials
onto
their
keys."
Sophie
sighed,
still
watching
him
carefully.
"This
seal
is
the
symbol
of
a
secret
society
known
as
the
Priory
of
Sion."
Vernet
again
showed
no
reaction.
"I
know
nothing
of
this.
Your
grandfather
was
a
friend,
but
we
spoke
mostly
of
business."
The
man
adjusted
his
tie,
looking
nervous
now.
"Monsieur
Vernet,"
Sophie
pressed,
her
tone
firm.
"My
grandfather
called
me
tonight
and
told
me
he
and
I
were
in
grave
danger.
He
said
he
had
to
give
me
something.
He
gave
me
a
key
to
your
bank.
Now
he
is
dead.
Anything
you
can
tell
us
would
be
helpful."
Vernet
broke
a
sweat.
"We
need
to
get
out
of
the
building.
I'm
afraid
the
police
will
arrive
shortly.
My
watchman
felt
obliged
to
call
Interpol."
Sophie
had
feared
as
much.
She
took
one
last
shot.
"My
grandfather
said
he
needed
to
tell
me
the
truth
about
my
family.
Does
that
mean
anything
to
you?"
"Mademoiselle,
your
family
died
in
a
car
accident
when
you
were
young.
I'm
sorry.
I
know
your
grandfather
loved
you
very
much.
He
mentioned
to
me
several
times
how
much
it
pained
him
that
you
two
had
fallen
out
of
touch."
Sophie
was
uncertain
how
to
respond.
Langdon
asked,
"Do
the
contents
of
this
account
have
anything
to
do
with
the
Sangreal?"
Vernet
gave
him
an
odd
look.
"I
have
no
idea
what
that
is."
Just
then,
Vernet's
cell
phone
rang,
and
he
snatched
it
off
his
belt.
"Oui?"
He
listened
a
moment,
his
expression
one
of
surprise
and
growing
concern.
"La
police?
Si
rapidement?"
He
cursed,
gave
some
quick
directions
in
French,
and
said
he
would
be
up
to
the
lobby
in
a
minute.
Hanging
up
the
phone,
he
turned
back
to
Sophie.
"The
police
have
responded
far
more
quickly
than
usual.
They
are
arriving
as
we
speak."
Sophie
had
no
intention
of
leaving
empty
handed.
"Tell
them
we
came
and
went
already.
If
they
want
to
search
the
bank,
demand
a
search
warrant.
That
will
take
them
time."
"Listen,"
Vernet
said,
"Jacques
was
a
friend,
and
my
bank
does
not
need
this
kind
of
press,
so
for
those
two
reasons,
I
have
no
intention
of
allowing
this
arrest
to
be
made
on
my
premises.
Give
me
a
minute
and
I
will
see
what
I
can
do
to
help
you
leave
the
bank
undetected.
Beyond
that,
I
cannot
get
involved."
He
stood
up
and
hurried
for
the
door.
"Stay
here.
I'll
make
arrangements
and
be
right
back."
"But
the
safe
deposit
box,"
Sophie
declared.
"We
can't
just
leave."
"There's
nothing
I
can
do,"
Vernet
said,
hurrying
out
the
door.
"I'm
sorry."
Sophie
stared
after
him
a
moment,
wondering
if
maybe
the
account
number
was
buried
in
one
of
the
countless
letters
and
packages
her
grandfather
had
sent
her
over
the
years
and
which
she
had
left
unopened.
Langdon
stood
suddenly,
and
Sophie
sensed
an
unexpected
glimmer
of
contentment
in
his
eyes.
"Robert?
You're
smiling."
"Your
grandfather
was
a
genius."
"I'm
sorry?"
"Ten
digits?"
Sophie
had
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about.
"The
account
number,"
he
said,
a
familiar
lopsided
grin
now
craning
his
face.
"I'm
pretty
sure
he
left
it
for
us
after
all.
"Where?"
Langdon
produced
the
printout
of
the
crime
scene
photo
and
spread
it
out
on
the
coffee
table.
Sophie
needed
only
to
read
the
first
line
to
know
Langdon
was
correct.

Sophie
said,
her
cryptologic
senses
tingling
as
she
studied
the
printout.

Grand
pere
wrote
his
account
number
on
the
Louvre
floor!
When
Sophie
had
first
seen
the
scrambled
Fibonacci
sequence
on
the
parquet,
she
had
assumed
its
sole
purpose
was
to
encourage
DCPJ
to
call
in
their
cryptographers
and
get
Sophie
involved.
Later,
she
realized
the
numbers
were
also
a
clue
as
to
how
to
decipher
the
other
lines
a
sequence
out
of
order
a
numeric
anagram.
Now,
utterly
amazed,
she
saw
the
numbers
had
a
more
important
meaning
still.
They
were
almost
certainly
the
final
key
to
opening
her
grandfather's
mysterious
safe
deposit
box.
"He
was
the
master
of
double
entendres,"
Sophie
said,
turning
to
Langdon.
"He
loved
anything
with
multiple
layers
of
meaning.
Codes
within
codes."
Langdon
was
already
moving
toward
the
electronic
podium
near
the
conveyor
belt.
Sophie
grabbed
the
computer
printout
and
followed.
The
podium
had
a
keypad
similar
to
that
of
a
bank
ATM
terminal.
The
screen
displayed
the
bank's
cruciform
logo.
Beside
the
keypad
was
a
triangular
hole.
Sophie
wasted
no
time
inserting
the
shaft
of
her
key
into
the
hole.
The
screen
refreshed
instantly.
ACCOUNT
NUMBER:
The
cursor
blinked.
Waiting.
Ten
digits.
Sophie
read
the
numbers
off
the
printout,
and
Langdon
typed
them
in.
ACCOUNT
NUMBER:
1332211185
When
he
had
typed
the
last
digit,
the
screen
refreshed
again.
A
message
in
several
languages
appeared.
English
was
on
top.
CAUTION:
Before
you
strike
the
enter
key,
please
check
the
accuracy
of
your
account
number.
For
your
own
security,
if
the
computer
does
not
recognize
your
account
number,
this
system
will
automatically
shut
down.
"Fonction
terminer,
"
Sophie
said,
frowning.
"Looks
like
we
only
get
one
try."
Standard
ATM
machines
allowed
users
three
attempts
to
type
a
PIN
before
confiscating
their
bank
card.
This
was
obviously
no
ordinary
cash
machine.
"The
number
looks
right,"
Langdon
confirmed,
carefully
checking
what
they
had
typed
and
comparing
it
to
the
printout.
He
motioned
to
the
ENTER
key.
"Fire
away."
Sophie
extended
her
index
finger
toward
the
keypad,
but
hesitated,
an
odd
thought
now
hitting
her.
"Go
ahead,"
Langdon
urged.
"Vernet
will
be
back
soon."
"No."
She
pulled
her
hand
away.
"This
isn't
the
right
account
number."
"Of
course
it
is!
Ten
digits.
What
else
would
it
be?"
"It's
too
random."
Too
random?
Langdon
could
not
have
disagreed
more.
Every
bank
advised
its
customers
to
choose
PINs
at
random
so
nobody
could
guess
them.
Certainly
clients
here
would
be
advised
to
choose
their
account
numbers
at
random.
Sophie
deleted
everything
she
had
just
typed
in
and
looked
up
at
Langdon,
her
gaze
self
assured.
"It's
far
too
coincidental
that
this
supposedly
random
account
number
could
be
rearranged
to
form
the
Fibonacci
sequence.
Langdon
realized
she
had
a
point.
Earlier,
Sophie
had
rearranged
this
account
number
into
the
Fibonacci
sequence.
What
were
the
odds
of
being
able
to
do
that?
Sophie
was
at
the
keypad
again,
entering
a
different
number,
as
if
from
memory.
"Moreover,
with
my
grandfather's
love
of
symbolism
and
codes,
it
seems
to
follow
that
he
would
have
chosen
an
account
number
that
had
meaning
to
him,
something
he
could
easily
remember."
She
finished
typing
the
entry
and
gave
a
sly
smile.
"Something
that
appeared
random
but
was
not.
"
Langdon
looked
at
the
screen.
ACCOUNT
NUMBER:
1123581321
It
took
him
an
instant,
but
when
Langdon
spotted
it,
he
knew
she
was
right.
The
Fibonacci
sequence.

When
the
Fibonacci
sequence
was
melded
into
a
single
ten
digit
number,
it
became
virtually
unrecognizable.
Easy
to
remember,
and
yet
seemingly
random.
A
brilliant
ten
digit
code
that
Sauniere
would
never
forget.
Furthermore,
it
perfectly
explained
why
the
scrambled
numbers
on
the
Louvre
floor
could
be
rearranged
to
form
the
famous
progression.
Sophie
reached
down
and
pressed
the
ENTER
key.
Nothing
happened.
At
least
nothing
they
could
detect.
At
that
moment,
beneath
them,
in
the
bank's
cavernous
subterranean
vault,
a
robotic
claw
sprang
to
life.
Sliding
on
a
double
axis
transport
system
attached
to
the
ceiling,
the
claw
headed
off
in
search
of
the
proper
coordinates.
On
the
cement
floor
below,
hundreds
of
identical
plastic
crates
lay
aligned
on
an
enormous
grid
like
rows
of
small
coffins
in
an
underground
crypt.
Whirring
to
a
stop
over
the
correct
spot
on
the
floor,
the
claw
dropped
down,
an
electric
eye
confirming
the
bar
code
on
the
box.
Then,
with
computer
precision,
the
claw
grasped
the
heavy
handle
and
hoisted
the
crate
vertically.
New
gears
engaged,
and
the
claw
transported
the
box
to
the
far
side
of
the
vault,
coming
to
a
stop
over
a
stationary
conveyor
belt.
Gently
now,
the
retrieval
arm
set
down
the
crate
and
retracted.
Once
the
arm
was
clear,
the
conveyor
belt
whirred
to
life.
Upstairs,
Sophie
and
Langdon
exhaled
in
relief
to
see
the
conveyor
belt
move.
Standing
beside
the
belt,
they
felt
like
weary
travelers
at
baggage
claim
awaiting
a
mysterious
piece
of
luggage
whose
contents
were
unknown.
The
conveyor
belt
entered
the
room
on
their
right
through
a
narrow
slit
beneath
a
retractable
door.
The
metal
door
slid
up,
and
a
huge
plastic
box
appeared,
emerging
from
the
depths
on
the
inclined
conveyor
belt.
The
box
was
black,
heavy
molded
plastic,
and
far
larger
than
she
imagined.
It
looked
like
an
air
freight
pet
transport
crate
without
any
airholes.
The
box
coasted
to
a
stop
directly
in
front
of
them.
Langdon
and
Sophie
stood
there,
silent,
staring
at
the
mysterious
container.
Like
everything
else
about
this
bank,
this
crate
was
industrial
metal
clasps,
a
bar
code
sticker
on
top,
and
molded
heavy
duty
handle.
Sophie
thought
it
looked
like
a
giant
toolbox.
Wasting
no
time,
Sophie
unhooked
the
two
buckles
facing
her.
Then
she
glanced
over
at
Langdon.
Together,
they
raised
the
heavy
lid
and
let
it
fall
back.
Stepping
forward,
they
peered
down
into
the
crate.
At
first
glance,
Sophie
thought
the
crate
was
empty.
Then
she
saw
something.
Sitting
at
the
bottom
of
the
crate.
A
lone
item.
The
polished
wooden
box
was
about
the
size
of
a
shoebox
and
had
ornate
hinges.
The
wood
was
a
lustrous
deep
purple
with
a
strong
grain.
Rosewood,
Sophie
realized.
Her
grandfather's
favorite.
The
lid
bore
a
beautiful
inlaid
design
of
a
rose.
She
and
Langdon
exchanged
puzzled
looks.
Sophie
leaned
in
and
grabbed
the
box,
lifting
it
out.
My
God,
it's
heavy!
She
carried
it
gingerly
to
a
large
receiving
table
and
set
it
down.
Langdon
stood
beside
her,
both
of
them
staring
at
the
small
treasure
chest
her
grandfather
apparently
had
sent
them
to
retrieve.
Langdon
stared
in
wonderment
at
the
lid's
hand
carved
inlay
a
five
petal
rose.
He
had
seen
this
type
of
rose
many
times.
"The
five
petal
rose,"
he
whispered,
"is
a
Priory
symbol
for
the
Holy
Grail."
Sophie
turned
and
looked
at
him.
Langdon
could
see
what
she
was
thinking,
and
he
was
thinking
it
too.
The
dimensions
of
the
box,
the
apparent
weight
of
its
contents,
and
a
Priory
symbol
for
the
Grail
all
seemed
to
imply
one
unfathomable
conclusion.
The
Cup
of
Christ
is
in
this
wooden
box.
Langdon
again
told
himself
it
was
impossible.
"It's
a
perfect
size,"
Sophie
whispered,
"to
hold
a
chalice."
It
can
't
be
a
chalice.
Sophie
pulled
the
box
toward
her
across
the
table,
preparing
to
open
it.
As
she
moved
it,
though,
something
unexpected
happened.
The
box
let
out
an
odd
gurgling
sound.
Langdon
did
a
double
take.
There's
liquid
inside?
Sophie
looked
equally
confused.
"Did
you
just
hear?"
Langdon
nodded,
lost.
"Liquid."
Reaching
forward,
Sophie
slowly
unhooked
the
clasp
and
raised
the
lid.
The
object
inside
was
unlike
anything
Langdon
had
ever
seen.
One
thing
was
immediately
clear
to
both
of
them,
however.
This
was
definitely
not
the
Cup
of
Christ.
"The
police
are
blocking
the
street,"
Andre
Vernet
said,
walking
into
the
waiting
room.
"Getting
you
out
will
be
difficult."
As
he
closed
the
door
behind
him,
Vernet
saw
the
heavy
duty
plastic
case
on
the
conveyor
belt
and
halted
in
his
tracks.
My
God!
They
accessed
Sauniere's
account?
Sophie
and
Langdon
were
at
the
table,
huddling
over
what
looked
to
be
a
large
wooden
jewelry
box.
Sophie
immediately
closed
the
lid
and
looked
up.
"We
had
the
account
number
after
all,"
she
said.
Vernet
was
speechless.
This
changed
everything.
He
respectfully
diverted
his
eyes
from
the
box
and
tried
to
figure
out
his
next
move.
have
to
get
them
out
of
the
bank!
But
with
the
police
already
having
set
up
a
roadblock,
Vernet
could
imagine
only
one
way
to
do
that.
"Mademoiselle
Neveu,
if
I
can
get
you
safely
out
of
the
bank,
will
you
be
taking
the
item
with
you
or
returning
it
to
the
vault
before
you
leave?"
Sophie
glanced
at
Langdon
and
then
back
to
Vernet.
"We
need
to
take
it."
Vernet
nodded.
"Very
well.
Then
whatever
the
item
is,
I
suggest
you
wrap
it
in
your
jacket
as
we
move
through
the
hallways.
I
would
prefer
nobody
else
see
it."
As
Langdon
shed
his
jacket,
Vernet
hurried
over
to
the
conveyor
belt,
closed
the
now
empty
crate,
and
typed
a
series
of
simple
commands.
The
conveyor
belt
began
moving
again,
carrying
the
plastic
container
back
down
to
the
vault.
Pulling
the
gold
key
from
the
podium,
he
handed
it
to
Sophie.
"This
way
please.
Hurry."
When
they
reached
the
rear
loading
dock,
Vernet
could
see
the
flash
of
police
lights
filtering
through
the
underground
garage.
He
frowned.
They
were
probably
blocking
the
ramp.
Am
I
really
going
to
try
to
pull
this
off?
He
was
sweating
now.
Vernet
motioned
to
one
of
the
bank's
small
armored
trucks.
Transport
siir
was
another
service
offered
by
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich.
"Get
in
the
cargo
hold,"
he
said,
heaving
open
the
massive
rear
door
and
motioning
to
the
glistening
steel
compartment.
"I'll
be
right
back."
As
Sophie
and
Langdon
climbed
in,
Vernet
hurried
across
the
loading
dock
to
the
dock
overseer's
office,
let
himself
in,
collected
the
keys
for
the
truck,
and
found
a
driver's
uniform
jacket
and
cap.
Shedding
his
own
suit
coat
and
tie,
he
began
to
put
on
the
driver's
jacket.
Reconsidering,
he
donned
a
shoulder
holster
beneath
the
uniform.
On
his
way
out,
he
grabbed
a
driver's
pistol
from
the
rack,
put
in
a
clip,
and
stuffed
it
in
the
holster,
buttoning
his
uniform
over
it.
Returning
to
the
truck,
Vernet
pulled
the
driver's
cap
down
low
and
peered
in
at
Sophie
and
Langdon,
who
were
standing
inside
the
empty
steel
box.
"You'll
want
this
on,"
Vernet
said,
reaching
inside
and
flicking
a
wall
switch
to
illuminate
the
lone
courtesy
bulb
on
the
hold's
ceiling.
"And
you'd
better
sit
down.
Not
a
sound
on
our
way
out
the
gate."
Sophie
and
Langdon
sat
down
on
the
metal
floor.
Langdon
cradled
the
treasure
wadded
in
his
tweed
jacket.
Swinging
the
heavy
doors
closed,
Vernet
locked
them
inside.
Then
he
got
in
behind
the
wheel
and
revved
the
engine.
As
the
armored
truck
lumbered
toward
the
top
of
the
ramp,
Vernet
could
feel
the
sweat
already
collecting
beneath
his
driver's
cap.
He
could
see
there
were
far
more
police
lights
in
front
than
he
had
imagined.
As
the
truck
powered
up
the
ramp,
the
interior
gate
swung
inward
to
let
him
pass.
Vernet
advanced
and
waited
while
the
gate
behind
him
closed
before
pulling
forward
and
tripping
the
next
sensor.
The
second
gate
opened,
and
the
exit
beckoned.
Except
for
the
police
car
blocking
the
top
of
the
ramp.
Vernet
dabbed
his
brow
and
pulled
forward.
A
lanky
officer
stepped
out
and
waved
him
to
a
stop
a
few
meters
from
the
roadblock.
Four
patrol
cars
were
parked
out
front.
Vernet
stopped.
Pulling
his
driver's
cap
down
farther,
he
effected
as
rough
a
facade
as
his
cultured
upbringing
would
allow.
Not
budging
from
behind
the
wheel,
he
opened
the
door
and
gazed
down
at
the
agent,
whose
face
was
stern
and
sallow.
"Qu'est
ce
qui
se
passe?"
Vernet
asked,
his
tone
rough.
"Je
suis
Jerome
Collet,
"
the
agent
said.
"Lieutenant
Police
Judiciaire.
"
He
motioned
to
the
truck's
cargo
hold.
"Qu'est
ce
qu'ily
a
la
dedans?"
"Hell
if
I
know,"
Vernet
replied
in
crude
French.
"I'm
only
a
driver."
Collet
looked
unimpressed.
"We're
looking
for
two
criminals."
Vernet
laughed.
"Then
you
came
to
the
right
spot.
Some
of
these
bastards
I
drive
for
have
so
much
money
they
must
be
criminals."
The
agent
held
up
a
passport
picture
of
Robert
Langdon.
"Was
this
man
in
your
bank
tonight?"
Vernet
shrugged.
"No
clue.
I'm
a
dock
rat.
They
don't
let
us
anywhere
near
the
clients.
You
need
to
go
in
and
ask
the
front
desk."
"Your
bank
is
demanding
a
search
warrant
before
we
can
enter."
Vernet
put
on
a
disgusted
look.
"Administrators.
Don't
get
me
started."
"Open
your
truck,
please."
Collet
motioned
toward
the
cargo
hold.
Vernet
stared
at
the
agent
and
forced
an
obnoxious
laugh.
"Open
the
truck?
You
think
I
have
keys?
You
think
they
trust
us?
You
should
see
the
crap
wages
I
get
paid."
The
agent's
head
tilted
to
one
side,
his
skepticism
evident.
"You're
telling
me
you
don't
have
keys
to
your
own
truck?"
Vernet
shook
his
head.
"Not
the
cargo
area.
Ignition
only.
These
trucks
get
sealed
by
overseers
on
the
loading
dock.
Then
the
truck
sits
in
dock
while
someone
drives
the
cargo
keys
to
the
drop
off.
Once
we
get
the
call
that
the
cargo
keys
are
with
the
recipient,
then
I
get
the
okay
to
drive.
Not
a
second
before.
I
never
know
what
the
hell
I'm
lugging."
"When
was
this
truck
sealed?"
"Must
have
been
hours
ago.
I'm
driving
all
the
way
up
to
St.
Thurial
tonight.
Cargo
keys
are
already
up
there."
The
agent
made
no
response,
his
eyes
probing
as
if
trying
to
read
Vernet's
mind.
A
drop
of
sweat
was
preparing
to
slide
down
Vernet's
nose.
"You
mind?"
he
said,
wiping
his
nose
with
his
sleeve
and
motioning
to
the
police
car
blocking
his
way.
"I'm
on
a
tight
schedule."
"Do
all
the
drivers
wear
Rolexes?"
the
agent
asked,
pointing
to
Vernet's
wrist.
Vernet
glanced
down
and
saw
the
glistening
band
of
his
absurdly
expensive
watch
peeking
out
from
beneath
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket.
Merde.
"This
piece
of
shit?
Bought
it
for
twenty
euro
from
a
Taiwanese
street
vendor
in
St.
Germain
des
Pres.
I'll
sell
it
to
you
for
forty."
The
agent
paused
and
finally
stepped
aside.
"No
thanks.
Have
a
safe
trip."
Vernet
did
not
breathe
again
until
the
truck
was
a
good
fifty
meters
down
the
street.
And
now
he
had
another
problem.
His
cargo.
Where
do
I
take
them?
Silas
lay
prone
on
the
canvas
mat
in
his
room,
allowing
the
lash
wounds
on
his
back
to
clot
in
the
air.
Tonight's
second
session
with
the
Discipline
had
left
him
dizzy
and
weak.
He
had
yet
to
remove
the
cilice
belt,
and
he
could
feel
the
blood
trickling
down
his
inner
thigh.
Still,
he
could
not
justify
removing
the
strap.
have
failed
the
Church.
Far
worse,
I
have
failed
the
bishop.
Tonight
was
supposed
to
be
Bishop
Aringarosa's
salvation.
Five
months
ago,
the
bishop
had
returned
from
a
meeting
at
the
Vatican
Observatory,
where
he
had
learned
something
that
left
him
deeply
changed.
Depressed
for
weeks,
Aringarosa
had
finally
shared
the
news
with
Silas.
"But
this
is
impossible!"
Silas
had
cried
out.
"I
cannot
accept
it!"
"It
is
true,"
Aringarosa
said.
"Unthinkable,
but
true.
In
only
six
months."
The
bishop's
words
terrified
Silas.
He
prayed
for
deliverance,
and
even
in
those
dark
days,
his
trust
in
God
and
The
Way
never
wavered.
It
was
only
a
month
later
that
the
clouds
parted
miraculously
and
the
light
of
possibility
shone
through.
Divine
intervention,
Aringarosa
had
called
it.
The
bishop
had
seemed
hopeful
for
the
first
time.
"Silas,"
he
whispered,
"God
has
bestowed
upon
us
an
opportunity
to
protect
The
Way.
Our
battle,
like
all
battles,
will
take
sacrifice.
Will
you
be
a
soldier
of
God?"
Silas
fell
to
his
knees
before
Bishop
Aringarosa
the
man
who
had
given
him
a
new
life
and
he
said,
"I
am
a
lamb
of
God.
Shepherd
me
as
your
heart
commands."
When
Aringarosa
described
the
opportunity
that
had
presented
itself,
Silas
knew
it
could
only
be
the
hand
of
God
at
work.
Miraculous
fate!
Aringarosa
put
Silas
in
contact
with
the
man
who
had
proposed
the
plan
a
man
who
called
himself
the
Teacher.
Although
the
Teacher
and
Silas
never
met
face
to
face,
each
time
they
spoke
by
phone,
Silas
was
awed,
both
by
the
profundity
of
the
Teacher's
faith
and
by
the
scope
of
his
power.
The
Teacher
seemed
to
be
a
man
who
knew
all,
a
man
with
eyes
and
ears
in
all
places.
How
the
Teacher
gathered
his
information,
Silas
did
not
know,
but
Aringarosa
had
placed
enormous
trust
in
the
Teacher,
and
he
had
told
Silas
to
do
the
same.
"Do
as
the
Teacher
commands
you,"
the
bishop
told
Silas.
"And
we
will
be
victorious."
Victorious.
Silas
now
gazed
at
the
bare
floor
and
feared
victory
had
eluded
them.
The
Teacher
had
been
tricked.
The
keystone
was
a
devious
dead
end.
And
with
the
deception,
all
hope
had
vanished.
Silas
wished
he
could
call
Bishop
Aringarosa
and
warn
him,
but
the
Teacher
had
removed
all
their
lines
of
direct
communication
tonight.
For
our
safety.
Finally,
overcoming
enormous
trepidation,
Silas
crawled
to
his
feet
and
found
his
robe,
which
lay
on
the
floor.
He
dug
his
cell
phone
from
the
pocket.
Hanging
his
head
in
shame,
he
dialed.
"Teacher,"
he
whispered,
"all
is
lost."
Silas
truthfully
told
the
man
how
he
had
been
tricked.
"You
lose
your
faith
too
quickly,"
the
Teacher
replied.
"I
have
just
received
news.
Most
unexpected
and
welcome.
The
secret
lives.
Jacques
Sauniere
transferred
information
before
he
died.
I
will
call
you
soon.
Our
work
tonight
is
not
yet
done."
Riding
inside
the
dimly
lit
cargo
hold
of
the
armored
truck
was
like
being
transported
inside
a
cell
for
solitary
confinement.
Langdon
fought
the
all
too
familiar
anxiety
that
haunted
him
in
confined
spaces.
Vernet
said
he
would
take
us
a
safe
distance
out
of
the
city.
Where?
How
far?
Langdon's
legs
had
gotten
stiff
from
sitting
cross
legged
on
the
metal
floor,
and
he
shifted
his
position,
wincing
to
feel
the
blood
pouring
back
into
his
lower
body.
In
his
arms,
he
still
clutched
the
bizarre
treasure
they
had
extricated
from
the
bank.
"I
think
we're
on
the
highway
now,"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
sensed
the
same
thing.
The
truck,
after
an
unnerving
pause
atop
the
bank
ramp,
had
moved
on,
snaking
left
and
right
for
a
minute
or
two,
and
was
now
accelerating
to
what
felt
like
top
speed.
Beneath
them,
the
bulletproof
tires
hummed
on
smooth
pavement.
Forcing
his
attention
to
the
rosewood
box
in
his
arms,
Langdon
laid
the
precious
bundle
on
the
floor,
unwrapped
his
jacket,
and
extracted
the
box,
pulling
it
toward
him.
Sophie
shifted
her
position
so
they
were
sitting
side
by
side.
Langdon
suddenly
felt
like
they
were
two
kids
huddled
over
a
Christmas
present.
In
contrast
to
the
warm
colors
of
the
rosewood
box,
the
inlaid
rose
had
been
crafted
of
a
pale
wood,
probably
ash,
which
shone
clearly
in
the
dim
light.
The
Rose.
Entire
armies
and
religions
had
been
built
on
this
symbol,
as
had
secret
societies.
The
Rosicrucians.
The
Knights
of
the
Rosy
Cross.
"Go
ahead,"
Sophie
said.
"Open
it."
Langdon
took
a
deep
breath.
Reaching
for
the
lid,
he
stole
one
more
admiring
glance
at
the
intricate
woodwork
and
then,
unhooking
the
clasp,
he
opened
the
lid,
revealing
the
object
within.
Langdon
had
harbored
several
fantasies
about
what
they
might
find
inside
this
box,
but
clearly
he
had
been
wrong
on
every
account.
Nestled
snugly
inside
the
box's
heavily
padded
interior
of
crimson
silk
lay
an
object
Langdon
could
not
even
begin
to
comprehend.
Crafted
of
polished
white
marble,
it
was
a
stone
cylinder
approximately
the
dimensions
of
a
tennis
ball
can.
More
complicated
than
a
simple
column
of
stone,
however,
the
cylinder
appeared
to
have
been
assembled
in
many
pieces.
Six
doughnutsized
disks
of
marble
had
been
stacked
and
affixed
to
one
another
within
a
delicate
brass
framework.
It
looked
like
some
kind
of
tubular,
multiwheeled
kaleidoscope.
Each
end
of
the
cylinder
was
affixed
with
an
end
cap,
also
marble,
making
it
impossible
to
see
inside.
Having
heard
liquid
within,
Langdon
assumed
the
cylinder
was
hollow.
As
mystifying
as
the
construction
of
the
cylinder
was,
however,
it
was
the
engravings
around
the
tube's
circumference
that
drew
Langdon's
primary
focus.
Each
of
the
six
disks
had
been
carefully
carved
with
the
same
unlikely
series
of
letters
the
entire
alphabet.
The
lettered
cylinder
reminded
Langdon
of
one
of
his
childhood
toys
a
rod
threaded
with
lettered
tumblers
that
could
be
rotated
to
spell
different
words.
"Amazing,
isn't
it?"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
glanced
up.
"I
don't
know.
What
the
hell
is
it?"
Now
there
was
a
glint
in
Sophie's
eye.
"My
grandfather
used
to
craft
these
as
a
hobby.
They
were
invented
by
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
Even
in
the
diffuse
light,
Sophie
could
see
Langdon'
s
surprise.
"Da
Vinci?"
he
muttered,
looking
again
at
the
canister.
"Yes.
It's
called
a
cryptex.
According
to
my
grandfather,
the
blueprints
come
from
one
of
Da
Vinci's
secret
diaries."
"What
is
it
for?"
Considering
tonight's
events,
Sophie
knew
the
answer
might
have
some
interesting
implications.
"It's
a
vault,"
she
said.
"For
storing
secret
information."
Langdon's
eyes
widened
further.
Sophie
explained
that
creating
models
of
Da
Vinci's
inventions
was
one
of
her
grandfather's
best
loved
hobbies.
A
talented
craftsman
who
spent
hours
in
his
wood
and
metal
shop,
Jacques
Sauniere
enjoyed
imitating
master
craftsmen
Faberge,
assorted
cloisonne
artisans,
and
the
less
artistic,
but
far
more
practical,
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
Even
a
cursory
glance
through
Da
Vinci's
journals
revealed
why
the
luminary
was
as
notorious
for
his
lack
of
follow
through
as
he
was
famous
for
his
brilliance.
Da
Vinci
had
drawn
up
blueprints
for
hundreds
of
inventions
he
had
never
built.
One
of
Jacques
Sauniere's
favorite
pastimes
was
bringing
Da
Vinci's
more
obscure
brainstorms
to
life
timepieces,
water
pumps,
cryptexes,
and
even
a
fully
articulated
model
of
a
medieval
French
knight,
which
now
stood
proudly
on
the
desk
in
his
office.
Designed
by
Da
Vinci
in
1495
as
an
outgrowth
of
his
earliest
anatomy
and
kinesiology
studies,
the
internal
mechanism
of
the
robot
knight
possessed
accurate
joints
and
tendons,
and
was
designed
to
sit
up,
wave
its
arms,
and
move
its
head
via
a
flexible
neck
while
opening
and
closing
an
anatomically
correct
jaw.
This
armor
clad
knight,
Sophie
had
always
believed,
was
the
most
beautiful
object
her
grandfather
had
ever
built
that
was,
until
she
had
seen
the
cryptex
in
this
rosewood
box.
"He
made
me
one
of
these
when
I
was
little,"
Sophie
said.
"But
I've
never
seen
one
so
ornate
and
large."
Langdon's
eyes
had
never
left
the
box.
"I've
never
heard
of
a
cryptex."
Sophie
was
not
surprised.
Most
of
Leonardo's
unbuilt
inventions
had
never
been
studied
or
even
named.
The
term
cryptex
possibly
had
been
her
grandfather's
creation,
an
apt
title
for
this
device
that
used
the
science
of
cryptology
to
protect
information
written
on
the
contained
scroll
or
codex.
Da
Vinci
had
been
a
cryptology
pioneer,
Sophie
knew,
although
he
was
seldom
given
credit.
Sophie's
university
instructors,
while
presenting
computer
encryption
methods
for
securing
data,
praised
modern
cryptologists
like
Zimmerman
and
Schneier
but
failed
to
mention
that
it
was
Leonardo
who
had
invented
one
of
the
first
rudimentary
forms
of
public
key
encryption
centuries
ago.
Sophie's
grandfather,
of
course,
had
been
the
one
to
tell
her
all
about
that.
As
their
armored
truck
roared
down
the
highway,
Sophie
explained
to
Langdon
that
the
cryptex
had
been
Da
Vinci's
solution
to
the
dilemma
of
sending
secure
messages
over
long
distances.
In
an
era
without
telephones
or
e
mail,
anyone
wanting
to
convey
private
information
to
someone
far
away
had
no
option
but
to
write
it
down
and
then
trust
a
messenger
to
carry
the
letter.
Unfortunately,
if
a
messenger
suspected
the
letter
might
contain
valuable
information,
he
could
make
far
more
money
selling
the
information
to
adversaries
than
he
could
delivering
the
letter
properly.
Many
great
minds
in
history
had
invented
cryptologic
solutions
to
the
challenge
of
data
protection:
Julius
Caesar
devised
a
code
writing
scheme
called
the
Caesar
Box;
Mary,
Queen
of
Scots
created
a
transposition
cipher
and
sent
secret
communiques
from
prison;
and
the
brilliant
Arab
scientist
Abu
Yusuf
Ismail
al
Kindi
protected
his
secrets
with
an
ingeniously
conceived
polyalphabetic
substitution
cipher.
Da
Vinci,
however,
eschewed
mathematics
and
cryptology
for
a
mechanical
solution.
The
cryptex.
A
portable
container
that
could
safeguard
letters,
maps,
diagrams,
anything
at
all.
Once
information
was
sealed
inside
the
cryptex,
only
the
individual
with
the
proper
password
could
access
it.
"We
require
a
password,"
Sophie
said,
pointing
out
the
lettered
dials.
"A
cryptex
works
much
like
a
bicycle's
combination
lock.
If
you
align
the
dials
in
the
proper
position,
the
lock
slides
open.
This
cryptex
has
five
lettered
dials.
When
you
rotate
them
to
their
proper
sequence,
the
tumblers
inside
align,
and
the
entire
cylinder
slides
apart."
"And
inside?"
"Once
the
cylinder
slides
apart,
you
have
access
to
a
hollow
central
compartment,
which
can
hold
a
scroll
of
paper
on
which
is
the
information
you
want
to
keep
private."
Langdon
looked
incredulous.
"And
you
say
your
grandfather
built
these
for
you
when
you
were
younger?"
"Some
smaller
ones,
yes.
A
couple
times
for
my
birthday,
he
gave
me
a
cryptex
and
told
me
a
riddle.
The
answer
to
the
riddle
was
the
password
to
the
cryptex,
and
once
I
figured
it
out,
I
could
open
it
up
and
find
my
birthday
card."
"A
lot
of
work
for
a
card."
"No,
the
cards
always
contained
another
riddle
or
clue.
My
grandfather
loved
creating
elaborate
treasure
hunts
around
our
house,
a
string
of
clues
that
eventually
led
to
my
real
gift.
Each
treasure
hunt
was
a
test
of
character
and
merit,
to
ensure
I
earned
my
rewards.
And
the
tests
were
never
simple."
Langdon
eyed
the
device
again,
still
looking
skeptical.
"But
why
not
just
pry
it
apart?
Or
smash
it?
The
metal
looks
delicate,
and
marble
is
a
soft
rock.
Sophie
smiled.
"Because
Da
Vinci
is
too
smart
for
that.
He
designed
the
cryptex
so
that
if
you
try
to
force
it
open
in
any
way,
the
information
self
destructs.
Watch."
Sophie
reached
into
the
box
and
carefully
lifted
out
the
cylinder.
"Any
information
to
be
inserted
is
first
written
on
a
papyrus
scroll."
"Not
vellum?"
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"Papyrus.
I
know
sheep's
vellum
was
more
durable
and
more
common
in
those
days,
but
it
had
to
be
papyrus.
The
thinner
the
better."
"Okay."
"Before
the
papyrus
was
inserted
into
the
cryptex's
compartment,
it
was
rolled
around
a
delicate
glass
vial."
She
tipped
the
cryptex,
and
the
liquid
inside
gurgled.
"A
vial
of
liquid."
"Liquid
what?"
Sophie
smiled.
"Vinegar."
Langdon
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
began
nodding.
"Brilliant."
Vinegar
and
papyrus,
Sophie
thought.
If
someone
attempted
to
force
open
the
cryptex,
the
glass
vial
would
break,
and
the
vinegar
would
quickly
dissolve
the
papyrus.
By
the
time
anyone
extracted
the
secret
message,
it
would
be
a
glob
of
meaningless
pulp.
"As
you
can
see,"
Sophie
told
him,
"the
only
way
to
access
the
information
inside
is
to
know
the
proper
five
letter
password.
And
with
five
dials,
each
with
twenty
six
letters,
that's
twenty
six
to
the
fifth
power."
She
quickly
estimated
the
permutations.
"Approximately
twelve
million
possibilities."
"If
you
say
so,"
Langdon
said,
looking
like
he
had
approximately
twelve
million
questions
running
through
his
head.
"What
information
do
you
think
is
inside?"
"Whatever
it
is,
my
grandfather
obviously
wanted
very
badly
to
keep
it
secret."
She
paused,
closing
the
box
lid
and
eyeing
the
five
petal
Rose
inlaid
on
it.
Something
was
bothering
her.
"Did
you
say
earlier
that
the
Rose
is
a
symbol
for
the
Grail?"
"Exactly.
In
Priory
symbolism,
the
Rose
and
the
Grail
are
synonymous."
Sophie
furrowed
her
brow.
"That's
strange,
because
my
grandfather
always
told
me
the
Rose
meant
secrecy.
He
used
to
hang
a
rose
on
his
office
door
at
home
when
he
was
having
a
confidential
phone
call
and
didn't
want
me
to
disturb
him.
He
encouraged
me
to
do
the
same."
Sweetie,
her
grandfather
said,
rather
than
lock
each
other
out,
we
can
each
hang
a
rose
lafleur
des
secrets
on
our
door
when
we
need
privacy.
This
way
we
learn
to
respect
and
trust
each
other.
Hanging
a
rose
is
an
ancient
Roman
custom.
"Sub
rosa,
"
Langdon
said.
"The
Romans
hung
a
rose
over
meetings
to
indicate
the
meeting
was
confidential.
Attendees
understood
that
whatever
was
said
under
the
rose
or
sub
rosa
had
to
remain
a
secret."
Langdon
quickly
explained
that
the
Rose's
overtone
of
secrecy
was
not
the
only
reason
the
Priory
used
it
as
a
symbol
for
the
Grail.
Rosa
rugosa,
one
of
the
oldest
species
of
rose,
had
five
petals
and
pentagonal
symmetry,
just
like
the
guiding
star
of
Venus,
giving
the
Rose
strong
iconographic
ties
to
womanhood.
In
addition,
the
Rose
had
close
ties
to
the
concept
of
"true
direction"
and
navigating
one's
way.
The
Compass
Rose
helped
travelers
navigate,
as
did
Rose
Lines,
the
longitudinal
lines
on
maps.
For
this
reason,
the
Rose
was
a
symbol
that
spoke
of
the
Grail
on
many
levels
secrecy,
womanhood,
and
guidance
the
feminine
chalice
and
guiding
star
that
led
to
secret
truth.
As
Langdon
finished
his
explanation,
his
expression
seemed
to
tighten
suddenly.
"Robert?
Are
you
okay?"
His
eyes
were
riveted
to
the
rosewood
box.
"Sub
rosa,
"
he
choked,
a
fearful
bewilderment
sweeping
across
his
face.
"It
can't
be."
"What?"
Langdon
slowly
raised
his
eyes.
"Under
the
sign
of
the
Rose,"
he
whispered.
"This
cryptex
I
think
I
know
what
it
is."
Langdon
could
scarcely
believe
his
own
supposition,
and
yet,
considering
who
had
given
this
stone
cylinder
to
them,
how
he
had
given
it
to
them,
and
now,
the
inlaid
Rose
on
the
container,
Langdon
could
formulate
only
one
conclusion.
am
holding
the
Priory
keystone.
The
legend
was
specific.
The
keystone
is
an
encoded
stone
that
lies
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
"Robert?"
Sophie
was
watching
him.
"What's
going
on?"
Langdon
needed
a
moment
to
gather
his
thoughts.
"Did
your
grandfather
ever
speak
to
you
of
something
called
la
clef
de
voiite?"
"The
key
to
the
vault?"
Sophie
translated.
"No,
that's
the
literal
translation.
Clef
de
voiite
is
a
common
architectural
term.
Voiite
refers
not
to
a
bank
vault,
but
to
a
vault
in
an
archway.
Like
a
vaulted
ceiling."
"But
vaulted
ceilings
don't
have
keys."
"Actually
they
do.
Every
stone
archway
requires
a
central,
wedge
shaped
stone
at
the
top
which
locks
the
pieces
together
and
carries
all
the
weight.
This
stone
is,
in
an
architectural
sense,
the
key
to
the
vault.
In
English
we
call
it
a
keystone.
"
Langdon
watched
her
eyes
for
any
spark
of
recognition.
Sophie
shrugged,
glancing
down
at
the
cryptex.
"But
this
obviously
is
not
a
keystone."
Langdon
didn't
know
where
to
begin.
Keystones
as
a
masonry
technique
for
building
stone
archways
had
been
one
of
the
best
kept
secrets
of
the
early
Masonic
brotherhood.
The
Royal
Arch
Degree.
Architecture.
Keystones.
It
was
all
interconnected.
The
secret
knowledge
of
how
to
use
a
wedged
keystone
to
build
a
vaulted
archway
was
part
of
the
wisdom
that
had
made
the
Masons
such
wealthy
craftsmen,
and
it
was
a
secret
they
guarded
carefully.
Keystones
had
always
had
a
tradition
of
secrecy.
And
yet,
the
stone
cylinder
in
the
rosewood
box
was
obviously
something
quite
different.
The
Priory
keystone
if
this
was
indeed
what
they
were
holding
was
not
at
all
what
Langdon
had
imagined.
"The
Priory
keystone
is
not
my
specialty,"
Langdon
admitted.
"My
interest
in
the
Holy
Grail
is
primarily
symbologic,
so
I
tend
to
ignore
the
plethora
of
lore
regarding
how
to
actually
find
it."
Sophie's
eyebrows
arched.
"Find
the
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon
gave
an
uneasy
nod,
speaking
his
next
words
carefully.
"Sophie,
according
to
Priory
lore,
the
keystone
is
an
encoded
map
a
map
that
reveals
the
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail."
Sophie's
face
went
blank.
"And
you
think
this
is
it?"
Langdon
didn't
know
what
to
say.
Even
to
him
it
sounded
unbelievable,
and
yet
the
keystone
was
the
only
logical
conclusion
he
could
muster.
An
encrypted
stone,
hidden
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
The
idea
that
the
cryptex
had
been
designed
by
Leonardo
da
Vinci
former
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion
shone
as
another
tantalizing
indicator
that
this
was
indeed
the
Priory
keystone.
A
former
Grand
Master's
blueprint
brought
to
life
centuries
later
by
another
Priory
member.
The
bond
was
too
palpable
to
dismiss.
For
the
last
decade,
historians
had
been
searching
for
the
keystone
in
French
churches.
Grail
seekers,
familiar
with
the
Priory's
history
of
cryptic
double
talk,
had
concluded
la
clef
de
voute
was
a
literal
keystone
an
architectural
wedge
an
engraved,
encrypted
stone,
inserted
into
a
vaulted
archway
in
a
church.
Beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
In
architecture,
there
was
no
shortage
of
roses.
Rose
windows.
Rosette
reliefs.
And,
of
course,
an
abundance
of
cinquefoils
the
five
petaled
decorative
flowers
often
found
at
the
top
of
archways,
directly
over
the
keystone.
The
hiding
place
seemed
diabolically
simple.
The
map
to
the
Holy
Grail
was
incorporated
high
in
an
archway
of
some
forgotten
church,
mocking
the
blind
churchgoers
who
wandered
beneath
it.
"This
cryptex
can't
bo,
the
keystone,"
Sophie
argued.
"It's
not
old
enough.
I'm
certain
my
grandfather
made
this.
It
can't
be
part
of
any
ancient
Grail
legend."
"Actually,"
Langdon
replied,
feeling
a
tingle
of
excitement
ripple
through
him,
"the
keystone
is
believed
to
have
been
created
by
the
Priory
sometime
in
the
past
couple
of
decades."
Sophie's
eyes
flashed
disbelief.
"But
if
this
cryptex
reveals
the
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail,
why
would
my
grandfather
give
it
to
me
?
I
have
no
idea
how
to
open
it
or
what
to
do
with
it.
I
don't
even
know
what
the
Holy
Grail
is!"
Langdon
realized
to
his
surprise
that
she
was
right.
He
had
not
yet
had
a
chance
to
explain
to
Sophie
the
true
nature
of
the
Holy
Grail.
That
story
would
have
to
wait.
At
the
moment,
they
were
focused
on
the
keystone.
If
that
is
indeed
what
this
is.
Against
the
hum
of
the
bulletproof
wheels
beneath
them,
Langdon
quickly
explained
to
Sophie
everything
he
had
heard
about
the
keystone.
Allegedly,
for
centuries,
the
Priory's
biggest
secret
the
location
of
the
Holy
Grail
was
never
written
down.
For
security's
sake,
it
was
verbally
transferred
to
each
new
rising
senechal
at
a
clandestine
ceremony.
However,
at
some
point
during
the
last
century,
whisperings
began
to
surface
that
the
Priory
policy
had
changed.
Perhaps
it
was
on
account
of
new
electronic
eavesdropping
capabilities,
but
the
Priory
vowed
never
again
even
to
speak
the
location
of
the
sacred
hiding
place.
"But
then
how
could
they
pass
on
the
secret?"
Sophie
asked.
"That's
where
the
keystone
comes
in,"
Langdon
explained.
"When
one
of
the
top
four
members
died,
the
remaining
three
would
choose
from
the
lower
echelons
the
next
candidate
to
ascend
as
senechal.
Rather
than
telling
the
new
senechal
where
the
Grail
was
hidden,
they
gave
him
a
test
through
which
he
could
prove
he
was
worthy."
Sophie
looked
unsettled
by
this,
and
Langdon
suddenly
recalled
her
mentioning
how
her
grandfather
used
to
make
treasure
hunts
for
her
preuves
de
merite.
Admittedly,
the
keystone
was
a
similar
concept.
Then
again,
tests
like
this
were
extremely
common
in
secret
societies.
The
best
known
was
the
Masons',
wherein
members
ascended
to
higher
degrees
by
proving
they
could
keep
a
secret
and
by
performing
rituals
and
various
tests
of
merit
over
many
years.
The
tasks
became
progressively
harder
until
they
culminated
in
a
successful
candidate's
induction
as
thirty
second
degree
Mason.
"So
the
keystone
is
apreuve
de
merite,
"
Sophie
said.
"If
a
rising
Priory
senechal
can
open
it,
he
proves
himself
worthy
of
the
information
it
holds."
Langdon
nodded.
"I
forgot
you'd
had
experience
with
this
sort
of
thing."
"Not
only
with
my
grandfather.
In
cryptology,
that's
called
a
'self
authorizing
language.'
That
is,
if
you're
smart
enough
to
read
it,
you're
permitted
to
know
what
is
being
said.
Langdon
hesitated
a
moment.
"Sophie,
you
realize
that
if
this
is
indeed
the
keystone,
your
grandfather's
access
to
it
implies
he
was
exceptionally
powerful
within
the
Priory
of
Sion.
He
would
have
to
have
been
one
of
the
highest
four
members."
Sophie
sighed.
"He
was
powerful
in
a
secret
society.
I'm
certain
of
it.
I
can
only
assume
it
was
the
Priory.
Langdon
did
a
double
take.
"You
knew
he
was
in
a
secret
society?"
"I
saw
some
things
I
wasn't
supposed
to
see
ten
years
ago.
We
haven't
spoken
since."
She
paused.
"My
grandfather
was
not
only
a
ranking
top
member
of
the
group
I
believe
he
was
the
top
member."
Langdon
could
not
believe
what
she
had
just
said.
"Grand
Master?
But
there's
no
way
you
could
know
that!"
"I'd
rather
not
talk
about
it."
Sophie
looked
away,
her
expression
as
determined
as
it
was
pained.
Langdon
sat
in
stunned
silence.
Jacques
Sauniere?
Grand
Master?
Despite
the
astonishing
repercussions
if
it
were
true,
Langdon
had
the
eerie
sensation
it
almost
made
perfect
sense.
After
all,
previous
Priory
Grand
Masters
had
also
been
distinguished
public
figures
with
artistic
souls.
Proof
of
that
fact
had
been
uncovered
years
ago
in
Paris's
Bibliotheque
Nationale
in
papers
that
became
known
as
Les
Dossiers
Secrets.
Every
Priory
historian
and
Grail
buff
had
read
the
Dossiers.
Cataloged
under
Number
4
lm
1
249,
the
Dossiers
Secrets
had
been
authenticated
by
many
specialists
and
incontrovertibly
confirmed
what
historians
had
suspected
for
a
long
time:
Priory
Grand
Masters
included
Leonardo
da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
Sir
Isaac
Newton,
Victor
Hugo,
and,
more
recently,
Jean
Cocteau,
the
famous
Parisian
artist.
Why
not
Jacques
Sauniere
?
Langdon's
incredulity
intensified
with
the
realization
that
he
had
been
slated
to
meet
Sauniere
tonight.
The
Priory
Grand
Master
called
a
meeting
with
me.
Why?
To
make
artistic
small
talk?
It
suddenly
seemed
unlikely.
After
all,
if
Langdon's
instincts
were
correct,
the
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion
had
just
transferred
the
brotherhood's
legendary
keystone
to
his
granddaughter
and
simultaneously
commanded
her
to
find
Robert
Langdon.
Inconceivable!
Langdon's
imagination
could
conjure
no
set
of
circumstances
that
would
explain
Sauniere's
behavior.
Even
if
Sauniere
feared
his
own
death,
there
were
three
senechaux
who
also
possessed
the
secret
and
therefore
guaranteed
the
Priory's
security.
Why
would
Sauniere
take
such
an
enormous
risk
giving
his
granddaughter
the
keystone,
especially
when
the
two
of
them
didn't
get
along?
And
why
involve
Langdon
a
total
stranger?
Apiece
of
this
puzzle
is
missing,
Langdon
thought.
The
answers
were
apparently
going
to
have
to
wait.
The
sound
of
the
slowing
engine
caused
them
both
to
look
up.
Gravel
crunched
beneath
the
tires.
Why
is
he
pulling
over
already?
Langdon
wondered.
Vernet
had
told
them
he
would
take
them
well
outside
the
city
to
safety.
The
truck
decelerated
to
a
crawl
and
made
its
way
over
unexpectedly
rough
terrain.
Sophie
shot
Langdon
an
uneasy
look,
hastily
closing
the
cryptex
box
and
latching
it.
Langdon
slipped
his
jacket
back
on.
When
the
truck
came
to
a
stop,
the
engine
remained
idling
as
the
locks
on
the
rear
doors
began
to
turn.
When
the
doors
swung
open,
Langdon
was
surprised
to
see
they
were
parked
in
a
wooded
area,
well
off
the
road.
Vernet
stepped
into
view,
a
strained
look
in
his
eye.
In
his
hand,
he
held
a
pistol.
'I'm
sorry
about
this,"
he
said.
"I
really
have
no
choice.
Andre
Vernet
looked
awkward
with
a
pistol,
but
his
eyes
shone
with
a
determination
that
Langdon
sensed
would
be
unwise
to
test.
"I'm
afraid
I
must
insist,"
Vernet
said,
training
the
weapon
on
the
two
of
them
in
the
back
of
the
idling
truck.
"Set
the
box
down."
Sophie
clutched
the
box
to
her
chest.
"You
said
you
and
my
grandfather
were
friends."
"I
have
a
duty
to
protect
your
grandfather's
assets,"
Vernet
replied.
"And
that
is
exactly
what
I
am
doing.
Now
set
the
box
on
the
floor."
"My
grandfather
entrusted
this
to
me!"
Sophie
declared.
"Do
it,"
Vernet
commanded,
raising
the
gun.
Sophie
set
the
box
at
her
feet.
Langdon
watched
the
gun
barrel
swing
now
in
his
direction.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
Vernet
said,
"you
will
bring
the
box
over
to
me.
And
be
aware
that
I'm
asking
you
because
you
I
would
not
hesitate
to
shoot."
Langdon
stared
at
the
banker
in
disbelief.
"Why
are
you
doing
this?"
"Why
do
you
imagine?"
Vernet
snapped,
his
accented
English
terse
now.
"To
protect
my
client's
assets."
"We
are
your
clients
now,"
Sophie
said.
Vernet's
visage
turned
ice
cold,
an
eerie
transformation.
"Mademoiselle
Neveu,
I
don't
know
how
you
got
that
key
and
account
number
tonight,
but
it
seems
obvious
that
foul
play
was
involved.
Had
I
known
the
extent
of
your
crimes,
I
would
never
have
helped
you
leave
the
bank."
"I
told
you,"
Sophie
said,
"we
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
grandfather's
death!"
Vernet
looked
at
Langdon.
"And
yet
the
radio
claims
you
are
wanted
not
only
for
the
murder
of
Jacques
Sauniere
but
for
those
of
three
other
men
as
well?"
"What!"
Langdon
was
thunderstruck.
Three
more
murders?
The
coincidental
number
hit
him
harder
than
the
fact
that
he
was
the
prime
suspect.
It
seemed
too
unlikely
to
be
a
coincidence.
The
three
senechaux?
Langdon's
eyes
dropped
to
the
rosewood
box.
If
the
senechaux
were
murdered,
Sauniere
had
no
options.
He
had
to
transfer
the
keystone
to
someone.
"The
police
can
sort
that
out
when
I
turn
you
in,"
Vernet
said.
"I
have
gotten
my
bank
involved
too
far
already."
Sophie
glared
at
Vernet.
"You
obviously
have
no
intention
of
turning
us
in.
You
would
have
driven
us
back
to
the
bank.
And
instead
you
bring
us
out
here
and
hold
us
at
gunpoint?"
"Your
grandfather
hired
me
for
one
reason
to
keep
his
possessions
both
safe
and
private.
Whatever
this
box
contains,
I
have
no
intention
of
letting
it
become
a
piece
of
cataloged
evidence
in
a
police
investigation.
Mr.
Langdon,
bring
me
the
box.
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"Don't
do
it."
A
gunshot
roared,
and
a
bullet
tore
into
the
wall
above
him.
The
reverberation
shook
the
back
of
the
truck
as
a
spent
shell
clinked
onto
the
cargo
floor.
Shit!
Langdon
froze.
Vernet
spoke
more
confidently
now.
"Mr.
Langdon,
pick
up
the
box."
Langdon
lifted
the
box.
"Now
bring
it
over
to
me."
Vernet
was
taking
dead
aim,
standing
on
the
ground
behind
the
rear
bumper,
his
gun
outstretched
into
the
cargo
hold
now.
Box
in
hand,
Langdon
moved
across
the
hold
toward
the
open
door.
I've
got
to
do
something!
Langdon
thought.
I'm
about
to
hand
over
the
Priory
keystone!
As
Langdon
moved
toward
the
doorway,
his
position
of
higher
ground
became
more
pronounced,
and
he
began
wondering
if
he
could
somehow
use
it
to
his
advantage.
Vernet's
gun,
though
raised,
was
at
Langdon's
knee
level.
A
well
placed
kick
perhaps?
Unfortunately,
as
Langdon
neared,
Vernet
seemed
to
sense
the
dangerous
dynamic
developing,
and
he
took
several
steps
back,
repositioning
himself
six
feet
away.
Well
out
of
reach.
Vernet
commanded,
"Place
the
box
beside
the
door."
Seeing
no
options,
Langdon
knelt
down
and
set
the
rosewood
box
at
the
edge
of
the
cargo
hold,
directly
in
front
of
the
open
doors.
"Now
stand
up."
Langdon
began
to
stand
up
but
paused,
spying
the
small,
spent
pistol
shell
on
the
floor
beside
the
truck's
precision
crafted
doorsill.
"Stand
up,
and
step
away
from
the
box."
Langdon
paused
a
moment
longer,
eyeing
the
metal
threshold.
Then
he
stood.
As
he
did,
he
discreetly
brushed
the
shell
over
the
edge
onto
the
narrow
ledge
that
was
the
door's
lower
sill.
Fully
upright
now,
Langdon
stepped
backward.
"Return
to
the
back
wall
and
turn
around."
Langdon
obeyed.
Vernet
could
feel
his
own
heart
pounding.
Aiming
the
gun
with
his
right
hand,
he
reached
now
with
his
left
for
the
wooden
box.
He
discovered
that
it
was
far
too
heavy.
need
two
hands.
Turning
his
eyes
back
to
his
captives,
he
calculated
the
risk.
Both
were
a
good
fifteen
feet
away,
at
the
far
end
of
the
cargo
hold,
facing
away
from
him.
Vernet
made
up
his
mind.
Quickly,
he
laid
down
the
gun
on
the
bumper,
lifted
the
box
with
two
hands,
and
set
it
on
the
ground,
immediately
grabbing
the
gun
again
and
aiming
it
back
into
the
hold.
Neither
of
his
prisoners
had
moved.
Perfect.
Now
all
that
remained
was
to
close
and
lock
the
door.
Leaving
the
box
on
the
ground
for
the
moment,
he
grabbed
the
metal
door
and
began
to
heave
it
closed.
As
the
door
swung
past
him,
Vernet
reached
up
to
grab
the
single
bolt
that
needed
to
be
slid
into
place.
The
door
closed
with
a
thud,
and
Vernet
quickly
grabbed
the
bolt,
pulling
it
to
the
left.
The
bolt
slid
a
few
inches
and
crunched
to
an
unexpected
halt,
not
lining
up
with
its
sleeve.
What's
going
on?
Vernet
pulled
again,
but
the
bolt
wouldn't
lock.
The
mechanism
was
not
properly
aligned.
The
door
isn't
fully
closed!
Feeling
a
surge
of
panic,
Vernet
shoved
hard
against
the
outside
of
the
door,
but
it
refused
to
budge.
Something
is
blocking
it!
Vernet
turned
to
throw
full
shoulder
into
the
door,
but
this
time
the
door
exploded
outward,
striking
Vernet
in
the
face
and
sending
him
reeling
backward
onto
the
ground,
his
nose
shattering
in
pain.
The
gun
flew
as
Vernet
reached
for
his
face
and
felt
the
warm
blood
running
from
his
nose.
Robert
Langdon
hit
the
ground
somewhere
nearby,
and
Vernet
tried
to
get
up,
but
he
couldn't
see.
His
vision
blurred
and
he
fell
backward
again.
Sophie
Neveu
was
shouting.
Moments
later,
Vernet
felt
a
cloud
of
dirt
and
exhaust
billowing
over
him.
He
heard
the
crunching
of
tires
on
gravel
and
sat
up
just
in
time
to
see
the
truck's
wide
wheelbase
fail
to
navigate
a
turn.
There
was
a
crash
as
the
front
bumper
clipped
a
tree.
The
engine
roared,
and
the
tree
bent.
Finally,
it
was
the
bumper
that
gave,
tearing
half
off.
The
armored
car
lurched
away,
its
front
bumper
dragging.
When
the
truck
reached
the
paved
access
road,
a
shower
of
sparks
lit
up
the
night,
trailing
the
truck
as
it
sped
away.
Vernet
turned
his
eyes
back
to
the
ground
where
the
truck
had
been
parked.
Even
in
the
faint
moonlight
he
could
see
there
was
nothing
there.
The
wooden
box
was
gone.
The
unmarked
Fiat
sedan
departing
Castel
Gandolfo
snaked
downward
through
the
Alban
Hills
into
the
valley
below.
In
the
back
seat,
Bishop
Aringarosa
smiled,
feeling
the
weight
of
the
bearer
bonds
in
the
briefcase
on
his
lap
and
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
he
and
the
Teacher
could
make
the
exchange.
Twenty
million
euro.
The
sum
would
buy
Aringarosa
power
far
more
valuable
than
that.
As
his
car
sped
back
toward
Rome,
Aringarosa
again
found
himself
wondering
why
the
Teacher
had
not
yet
contacted
him.
Pulling
his
cell
phone
from
his
cassock
pocket,
he
checked
the
carrier
signal.
Extremely
faint.
"Cell
service
is
intermittent
up
here,"
the
driver
said,
glancing
at
him
in
the
rearview
mirror.
"In
about
five
minutes,
we'll
be
out
of
the
mountains,
and
service
improves."
"Thank
you."
Aringarosa
felt
a
sudden
surge
of
concern.
No
service
in
the
mountains?
Maybe
the
Teacher
had
been
trying
to
reach
him
all
this
time.
Maybe
something
had
gone
terribly
wrong.
Quickly,
Aringarosa
checked
the
phone's
voice
mail.
Nothing.
Then
again,
he
realized,
the
Teacher
never
would
have
left
a
recorded
message;
he
was
a
man
who
took
enormous
care
with
his
communications.
Nobody
understood
better
than
the
Teacher
the
perils
of
speaking
openly
in
this
modern
world.
Electronic
eavesdropping
had
played
a
major
role
in
how
he
had
gathered
his
astonishing
array
of
secret
knowledge.
For
this
reason,
he
takes
extra
precautions.
Unfortunately,
the
Teacher's
protocols
for
caution
included
a
refusal
to
give
Aringarosa
any
kind
of
contact
number.
alone
will
initiate
contact,
the
Teacher
had
informed
him.
So
keep
your
phone
close.
Now
that
Aringarosa
realized
his
phone
might
not
have
been
working
properly,
he
feared
what
the
Teacher
might
think
if
he
had
been
repeatedly
phoning
with
no
answer.
He
'11
think
something
is
wrong.
Or
that
I
failed
to
get
the
bonds.
The
bishop
broke
a
light
sweat.
Or
worse
that
I
took
the
money
and
ran!
Even
at
a
modest
sixty
kilometers
an
hour,
the
dangling
front
bumper
of
the
armored
truck
grated
against
the
deserted
suburban
road
with
a
grinding
roar,
spraying
sparks
up
onto
the
hood.
We've
got
to
get
off
the
road,
Langdon
thought.
He
could
barely
even
see
where
they
were
headed.
The
truck's
lone
working
headlight
had
been
knocked
off
center
and
was
casting
a
skewed
sidelong
beam
into
the
woods
beside
the
country
highway.
Apparently
the
armor
in
this
"armored
truck"
referred
only
to
the
cargo
hold
and
not
the
front
end.
Sophie
sat
in
the
passenger
seat,
staring
blankly
at
the
rosewood
box
on
her
lap.
"Are
you
okay?"
Langdon
asked.
Sophie
looked
shaken.
"Do
you
believe
him?"
"About
the
three
additional
murders?
Absolutely.
It
answers
a
lot
of
questions
the
issue
of
your
grandfather's
desperation
to
pass
on
the
keystone,
as
well
as
the
intensity
with
which
Fache
is
hunting
me."
"No,
I
meant
about
Vernet
trying
to
protect
his
bank."
Langdon
glanced
over.
"As
opposed
to?"
"Taking
the
keystone
for
himself."
Langdon
had
not
even
considered
it.
"How
would
he
even
know
what
this
box
contains?"
"His
bank
stored
it.
He
knew
my
grandfather.
Maybe
he
knew
things.
He
might
have
decided
he
wanted
the
Grail
for
himself."
Langdon
shook
his
head.
Vernet
hardly
seemed
the
type.
"In
my
experience,
there
are
only
two
reasons
people
seek
the
Grail.
Either
they
are
naive
and
believe
they
are
searching
for
the
long
lost
Cup
of
Christ"
"Or?"
"Or
they
know
the
truth
and
are
threatened
by
it.
Many
groups
throughout
history
have
sought
to
destroy
the
Grail."
The
silence
between
them
accentuated
the
sound
of
the
scraping
bumper.
They
had
driven
a
few
kilometers
now,
and
as
Langdon
watched
the
cascade
of
sparks
coming
off
the
front
of
the
truck,
he
wondered
if
it
was
dangerous.
Either
way,
if
they
passed
another
car,
it
would
certainly
draw
attention.
Langdon
made
up
his
mind.
"I'm
going
to
see
if
I
can
bend
this
bumper
back."
Pulling
onto
the
shoulder,
he
brought
the
truck
to
a
stop.
Silence
at
last.
As
Langdon
walked
toward
the
front
of
the
truck,
he
felt
surprisingly
alert.
Staring
into
the
barrel
of
yet
another
gun
tonight
had
given
him
a
second
wind.
He
took
a
deep
breath
of
nighttime
air
and
tried
to
get
his
wits
about
him.
Accompanying
the
gravity
of
being
a
hunted
man,
Langdon
was
starting
to
feel
the
ponderous
weight
of
responsibility,
the
prospect
that
he
and
Sophie
might
actually
be
holding
an
encrypted
set
of
directions
to
one
of
the
most
enduring
mysteries
of
all
time.
As
if
this
burden
were
not
great
enough,
Langdon
now
realized
that
any
possibility
of
finding
a
way
to
return
the
keystone
to
the
Priory
had
just
evaporated.
News
of
the
three
additional
murders
had
dire
implications.
The
Priory
has
been
infiltrated.
They
are
compromised.
The
brotherhood
was
obviously
being
watched,
or
there
was
a
mole
within
the
ranks.
It
seemed
to
explain
why
Sauniere
might
have
transferred
the
keystone
to
Sophie
and
Langdon
people
outside
the
brotherhood,
people
he
knew
were
not
compromised.
We
can
't
very
well
give
the
keystone
back
to
the
brotherhood.
Even
if
Langdon
had
any
idea
how
to
find
a
Priory
member,
chances
were
good
that
whoever
stepped
forward
to
take
the
keystone
could
be
the
enemy
himself.
For
the
moment,
at
least,
it
seemed
the
keystone
was
in
Sophie
and
Langdon's
hands,
whether
they
wanted
it
or
not.
The
truck's
front
end
looked
worse
than
Langdon
had
imagined.
The
left
headlight
was
gone,
and
the
right
one
looked
like
an
eyeball
dangling
from
its
socket.
Langdon
straightened
it,
and
it
dislodged
again.
The
only
good
news
was
that
the
front
bumper
had
been
torn
almost
clean
off.
Langdon
gave
it
a
hard
kick
and
sensed
he
might
be
able
to
break
it
off
entirely.
As
he
repeatedly
kicked
the
twisted
metal,
Langdon
recalled
his
earlier
conversation
with
Sophie.
My
grandfather
left
me
a
phone
message,
Sophie
had
told
him.
He
said
he
needed
to
tell
me
the
truth
about
my
family.
At
the
time
it
had
meant
nothing,
but
now,
knowing
the
Priory
of
Sion
was
involved,
Langdon
felt
a
startling
new
possibility
emerge.
The
bumper
broke
off
suddenly
with
a
crash.
Langdon
paused
to
catch
his
breath.
At
least
the
truck
would
no
longer
look
like
a
Fourth
of
July
sparkler.
He
grabbed
the
bumper
and
began
dragging
it
out
of
sight
into
the
woods,
wondering
where
they
should
go
next.
They
had
no
idea
how
to
open
the
cryptex,
or
why
Sauniere
had
given
it
to
them.
Unfortunately,
their
survival
tonight
seemed
to
depend
on
getting
answers
to
those
very
questions.
We
need
help,
Langdon
decided.
Professional
help.
In
the
world
of
the
Holy
Grail
and
the
Priory
of
Sion,
that
meant
only
one
man.
The
challenge,
of
course,
would
be
selling
the
idea
to
Sophie.
Inside
the
armored
car,
while
Sophie
waited
for
Langdon
to
return,
she
could
feel
the
weight
of
the
rosewood
box
on
her
lap
and
resented
it.
Why
did
my
grandfather
give
this
to
me
?
She
had
not
the
slightest
idea
what
to
do
with
it.
Think,
Sophie!
Use
your
head.
Grand
pere
is
trying
to
tell
you
something!
Opening
the
box,
she
eyed
the
cryptex's
dials.
A
proof
of
merit.
She
could
feel
her
grandfather's
hand
at
work.
The
keystone
is
a
map
that
can
be
followed
only
by
the
worthy.
It
sounded
like
her
grandfather
to
the
core.
Lifting
the
cryptex
out
of
the
box,
Sophie
ran
her
fingers
over
the
dials.
Five
letters.
She
rotated
the
dials
one
by
one.
The
mechanism
moved
smoothly.
She
aligned
the
disks
such
that
her
chosen
letters
lined
up
between
the
cryptex's
two
brass
alignment
arrows
on
either
end
of
the
cylinder.
The
dials
now
spelled
a
five
letter
word
that
Sophie
knew
was
absurdly
obvious.
G
R
A
I
L.
Gently,
she
held
the
two
ends
of
the
cylinder
and
pulled,
applying
pressure
slowly.
The
cryptex
didn't
budge.
She
heard
the
vinegar
inside
gurgle
and
stopped
pulling.
Then
she
tried
again.
V
I
N
C
I
Again,
no
movement.
V
O
U
T
E
Nothing.
The
cryptex
remained
locked
solid.
Frowning,
she
replaced
it
in
the
rosewood
box
and
closed
the
lid.
Looking
outside
at
Langdon,
Sophie
felt
grateful
he
was
with
her
tonight.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Her
grandfather's
rationale
for
including
him
was
now
clear.
Sophie
was
not
equipped
to
understand
her
grandfather's
intentions,
and
so
he
had
assigned
Robert
Langdon
as
her
guide.
A
tutor
to
oversee
her
education.
Unfortunately
for
Langdon,
he
had
turned
out
to
be
far
more
than
a
tutor
tonight.
He
had
become
the
target
of
Bezu
Fache
and
some
unseen
force
intent
on
possessing
the
Holy
Grail.
Whatever
the
Grail
turns
out
to
be.
Sophie
wondered
if
finding
out
was
worth
her
life.
As
the
armored
truck
accelerated
again,
Langdon
was
pleased
how
much
more
smoothly
it
drove.
"Do
you
know
how
to
get
to
Versailles?"
Sophie
eyed
him.
"Sightseeing?"
"No,
I
have
a
plan.
There's
a
religious
historian
I
know
who
lives
near
Versailles.
I
can't
remember
exactly
where,
but
we
can
look
it
up.
I've
been
to
his
estate
a
few
times.
His
name
is
Leigh
Teabing.
He's
a
former
British
Royal
Historian."
"And
he
lives
in
Paris?"
"Teabing's
life
passion
is
the
Grail.
When
whisperings
of
the
Priory
keystone
surfaced
about
fifteen
years
ago,
he
moved
to
France
to
search
churches
in
hopes
of
finding
it.
He's
written
some
books
on
the
keystone
and
the
Grail.
He
may
be
able
to
help
us
figure
out
how
to
open
it
and
what
to
do
with
it."
Sophie's
eyes
were
wary.
"Can
you
trust
him?"
"Trust
him
to
what?
Not
steal
the
information?"
"And
not
to
turn
us
in."
"I
don't
intend
to
tell
him
we're
wanted
by
the
police.
I'm
hoping
he'll
take
us
in
until
we
can
sort
all
this
out."
"Robert,
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
every
television
in
France
is
probably
getting
ready
to
broadcast
our
pictures?
Bezu
Fache
always
uses
the
media
to
his
advantage.
He'll
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
move
around
without
being
recognized."
Terrific,
Langdon
thought.
My
French
TV
debut
will
be
on
"Paris
's
Most
Wanted.
"
At
least
Jonas
Faukman
would
be
pleased;
every
time
Langdon
made
the
news,
his
book
sales
jumped.
"Is
this
man
a
good
enough
friend?"
Sophie
asked.
Langdon
doubted
Teabing
was
someone
who
watched
television,
especially
at
this
hour,
but
still
the
question
deserved
consideration.
Instinct
told
Langdon
that
Teabing
would
be
totally
trustworthy.
An
ideal
safe
harbor.
Considering
the
circumstances,
Teabing
would
probably
trip
over
himself
to
help
them
as
much
as
possible.
Not
only
did
he
owe
Langdon
a
favor,
but
Teabing
was
a
Grail
researcher,
and
Sophie
claimed
her
grandfather
was
the
actual
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion.
If
Teabing
heard
that,
he
would
salivate
at
the
thought
of
helping
them
figure
this
out.
"Teabing
could
be
a
powerful
ally,"
Langdon
said.
Depending
on
how
much
you
want
to
tell
him.
"Fache
probably
will
be
offering
a
monetary
reward."
Langdon
laughed.
"Believe
me,
money
is
the
last
thing
this
guy
needs."
Leigh
Teabing
was
wealthy
in
the
way
small
countries
were
wealthy.
A
descendant
of
Britain's
First
Duke
of
Lancaster,
Teabing
had
gotten
his
money
the
old
fashioned
way
he'd
inherited
it.
His
estate
outside
of
Paris
was
a
seventeenth
century
palace
with
two
private
lakes.
Langdon
had
first
met
Teabing
several
years
ago
through
the
British
Broadcasting
Corporation.
Teabing
had
approached
the
BBC
with
a
proposal
for
a
historical
documentary
in
which
he
would
expose
the
explosive
history
of
the
Holy
Grail
to
a
mainstream
television
audience.
The
BBC
producers
loved
Teabing's
hot
premise,
his
research,
and
his
credentials,
but
they
had
concerns
that
the
concept
was
so
shocking
and
hard
to
swallow
that
the
network
might
end
up
tarnishing
its
reputation
for
quality
journalism.
At
Teabing's
suggestion,
the
BBC
solved
its
credibility
fears
by
soliciting
three
cameos
from
respected
historians
from
around
the
world,
all
of
whom
corroborated
the
stunning
nature
of
the
Holy
Grail
secret
with
their
own
research.
Langdon
had
been
among
those
chosen.
The
BBC
had
flown
Langdon
to
Teabing's
Paris
estate
for
the
filming.
He
sat
before
cameras
in
Teabing's
opulent
drawing
room
and
shared
his
story,
admitting
his
initial
skepticism
on
hearing
of
the
alternate
Holy
Grail
story,
then
describing
how
years
of
research
had
persuaded
him
that
the
story
was
true.
Finally,
Langdon
offered
some
of
his
own
research
a
series
of
symbologic
connections
that
strongly
supported
the
seemingly
controversial
claims.
When
the
program
aired
in
Britain,
despite
its
ensemble
cast
and
well
documented
evidence,
the
premise
rubbed
so
hard
against
the
grain
of
popular
Christian
thought
that
it
instantly
confronted
a
firestorm
of
hostility.
It
never
aired
in
the
States,
but
the
repercussions
echoed
across
the
Atlantic.
Shortly
afterward,
Langdon
received
a
postcard
from
an
old
friend
the
Catholic
Bishop
of
Philadelphia.
The
card
simply
read:
Et
tu,
Robert?
"Robert,"
Sophie
asked,
"you're
certain
we
can
trust
this
man?"
"Absolutely.
We're
colleagues,
he
doesn't
need
money,
and
I
happen
to
know
he
despises
the
French
authorities.
The
French
government
taxes
him
at
absurd
rates
because
he
bought
a
historic
landmark.
He'll
be
in
no
hurry
to
cooperate
with
Fache."
Sophie
stared
out
at
the
dark
roadway.
"If
we
go
to
him,
how
much
do
you
want
to
tell
him?"
Langdon
looked
unconcerned.
"Believe
me,
Leigh
Teabing
knows
more
about
the
Priory
of
Sion
and
the
Holy
Grail
than
anyone
on
earth.
Sophie
eyed
him.
"More
than
my
grandfather?"
"I
meant
more
than
anyone
outside
the
brotherhood."
"How
do
you
know
Teabing
isn't
a
member
of
the
brotherhood?"
"Teabing
has
spent
his
life
trying
to
broadcast
the
truth
about
the
Holy
Grail.
The
Priory's
oath
is
to
keep
its
true
nature
hidden.
"Sounds
to
me
like
a
conflict
of
interest."
Langdon
understood
her
concerns.
Sauniere
had
given
the
cryptex
directly
to
Sophie,
and
although
she
didn't
know
what
it
contained
or
what
she
was
supposed
to
do
with
it,
she
was
hesitant
to
involve
a
total
stranger.
Considering
the
information
potentially
enclosed,
the
instinct
was
probably
a
good
one.
"We
don't
need
to
tell
Teabing
about
the
keystone
immediately.
Or
at
all,
even.
His
house
will
give
us
a
place
to
hide
and
think,
and
maybe
when
we
talk
to
him
about
the
Grail,
you'll
start
to
have
an
idea
why
your
grandfather
gave
this
to
you.
"Us,
"
Sophie
reminded.
Langdon
felt
a
humble
pride
and
wondered
yet
again
why
Sauniere
had
included
him.
"Do
you
know
more
or
less
where
Mr.
Teabing
lives?"
Sophie
asked.
"His
estate
is
called
Chateau
Villette."
Sophie
turned
with
an
incredulous
look.
"The
Chateau
Villette?"
"That's
the
one."
"Nice
friends."
"You
know
the
estate?"
"I've
passed
it.
It's
in
the
castle
district.
Twenty
minutes
from
here."
Langdon
frowned.
"That
far?"
"Yes,
which
will
give
you
enough
time
to
tell
me
what
the
Holy
Grail
really
is."
Langdon
paused.
"I'll
tell
you
at
Teabing's.
He
and
I
specialize
in
different
areas
of
the
legend,
so
between
the
two
of
us,
you'll
get
the
full
story."
Langdon
smiled.
"Besides,
the
Grail
has
been
Teabing's
life,
and
hearing
the
story
of
the
Holy
Grail
from
Leigh
Teabing
will
be
like
hearing
the
theory
of
relativity
from
Einstein
himself."
"Let's
hope
Leigh
doesn't
mind
late
night
visitors."
"For
the
record,
it's
Sir
Leigh."
Langdon
had
made
that
mistake
only
once.
"Teabing
is
quite
a
character.
He
was
knighted
by
the
Queen
several
years
back
after
composing
an
extensive
history
on
the
House
of
York."
Sophie
looked
over.
"You're
kidding,
right?
We're
going
to
visit
a
knight?"
Langdon
gave
an
awkward
smile.
"We're
on
a
Grail
quest,
Sophie.
Who
better
to
help
us
than
a
knight?"
The
Sprawling
185
acre
estate
of
Chateau
Villette
was
located
twenty
five
minutes
northwest
of
Paris
in
the
environs
of
Versailles.
Designed
by
Francois
Mansart
in
1668
for
the
Count
of
Aufflay,
it
was
one
of
Paris's
most
significant
historical
chateaux.
Complete
with
two
rectangular
lakes
and
gardens
designed
by
Le
Notre,
Chateau
Villette
was
more
of
a
modest
castle
than
a
mansion.
The
estate
fondly
had
become
known
as
la
Petite
Versailles.
Langdon
brought
the
armored
truck
to
a
shuddering
stop
at
the
foot
of
the
mile
long
driveway.
Beyond
the
imposing
security
gate,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing's
residence
rose
on
a
meadow
in
the
distance.
The
sign
on
the
gate
was
in
English:
PRIVATE
PROPERTY.
NO
TRESPASSING.
As
if
to
proclaim
his
home
a
British
Isle
unto
itself,
Teabing
had
not
only
posted
his
signs
in
English,
but
he
had
installed
his
gate's
intercom
entry
system
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
truck
the
passenger's
side
everywhere
in
Europe
except
England.
Sophie
gave
the
misplaced
intercom
an
odd
look.
"And
if
someone
arrives
without
a
passenger?"
"Don't
ask."
Langdon
had
already
been
through
that
with
Teabing.
"He
prefers
things
the
way
they
are
at
home."
Sophie
rolled
down
her
window.
"Robert,
you'd
better
do
the
talking."
Langdon
shifted
his
position,
leaning
out
across
Sophie
to
press
the
intercom
button.
As
he
did,
an
alluring
whiff
of
Sophie's
perfume
filled
his
nostrils,
and
he
realized
how
close
they
were.
He
waited
there,
awkwardly
prone,
while
a
telephone
began
ringing
over
the
small
speaker.
Finally,
the
intercom
crackled
and
an
irritated
French
accent
spoke.
"Chateau
Villette.
Who
is
calling?"
"This
is
Robert
Langdon,"
Langdon
called
out,
sprawled
across
Sophie's
lap.
"I'm
a
friend
of
Sir
Leigh
Teabing.
I
need
his
help."
"My
master
is
sleeping.
As
was
I.
What
is
your
business
with
him?"
"It
is
a
private
matter.
One
of
great
interest
to
him."
"Then
I'm
sure
he
will
be
pleased
to
receive
you
in
the
morning."
Langdon
shifted
his
weight.
"It's
quite
important."
"As
is
Sir
Leigh's
sleep.
If
you
are
a
friend,
then
you
are
aware
he
is
in
poor
health."
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
had
suffered
from
polio
as
a
child
and
now
wore
leg
braces
and
walked
with
crutches,
but
Langdon
had
found
him
such
a
lively
and
colorful
man
on
his
last
visit
that
it
hardly
seemed
an
infirmity.
"If
you
would,
please
tell
him
I
have
uncovered
new
information
about
the
Grail.
Information
that
cannot
wait
until
morning."
There
was
a
long
pause.
Langdon
and
Sophie
waited,
the
truck
idling
loudly.
A
full
minute
passed.
Finally,
someone
spoke.
"My
good
man,
I
daresay
you
are
still
on
Harvard
Standard
Time."
The
voice
was
crisp
and
light.
Langdon
grinned,
recognizing
the
thick
British
accent.
"Leigh,
my
apologies
for
waking
you
at
this
obscene
hour."
"My
manservant
tells
me
that
not
only
are
you
in
Paris,
but
you
speak
of
the
Grail."
"I
thought
that
might
get
you
out
of
bed."
"And
so
it
has."
"Any
chance
you'd
open
the
gate
for
an
old
friend?"
"Those
who
seek
the
truth
are
more
than
friends.
They
are
brothers."
Langdon
rolled
his
eyes
at
Sophie,
well
accustomed
to
Teabing's
predilection
for
dramatic
antics.
"Indeed
I
will
open
the
gate,"
Teabing
proclaimed,
"but
first
I
must
confirm
your
heart
is
true.
A
test
of
your
honor.
You
will
answer
three
questions."
Langdon
groaned,
whispering
at
Sophie.
"Bear
with
me
here.
As
I
mentioned,
he's
something
of
a
character."
"Your
first
question,"
Teabing
declared,
his
tone
Herculean.
"Shall
I
serve
you
coffee,
or
tea?"
Langdon
knew
Teabing's
feelings
about
the
American
phenomenon
of
coffee.
"Tea,"
he
replied.
"Earl
Grey."
"Excellent.
Your
second
question.
Milk
or
sugar?"
Langdon
hesitated.
"Milk,
"
Sophie
whispered
in
his
ear.
"I
think
the
British
take
milk."
"Milk,"
Langdon
said.
Silence.
"Sugar?"
Teabing
made
no
reply.
Wait!
Langdon
now
recalled
the
bitter
beverage
he
had
been
served
on
his
last
visit
and
realized
this
question
was
a
trick.
"Lemon!"
he
declared.
"Earl
Grey
with
lemon"
"Indeed."
Teabing
sounded
deeply
amused
now.
"And
finally,
I
must
make
the
most
grave
of
inquiries."
Teabing
paused
and
then
spoke
in
a
solemn
tone.
"In
which
year
did
a
Harvard
sculler
last
outrow
an
Oxford
man
at
Henley?"
Langdon
had
no
idea,
but
he
could
imagine
only
one
reason
the
question
had
been
asked.
"Surely
such
a
travesty
has
never
occurred.
The
gate
clicked
open.
"Your
heart
is
true,
my
friend.
You
may
pass."
"Monsieur
Vernet!"
The
night
manager
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
felt
relieved
to
hear
the
bank
president's
voice
on
the
phone.
"Where
did
you
go,
sir?
The
police
are
here,
everyone
is
waiting
for
you!"
"I
have
a
little
problem,"
the
bank
president
said,
sounding
distressed.
"I
need
your
help
right
away."
You
have
more
than
a
little
problem,
the
manager
thought.
The
police
had
entirely
surrounded
the
bank
and
were
threatening
to
have
the
DCPJ
captain
himself
show
up
with
the
warrant
the
bank
had
demanded.
"How
can
I
help
you,
sir?"
"Armored
truck
number
three.
I
need
to
find
it."
Puzzled,
the
manager
checked
his
delivery
schedule.
"It's
here.
Downstairs
at
the
loading
dock."
"Actually,
no.
The
truck
was
stolen
by
the
two
individuals
the
police
are
tracking."
"What?
How
did
they
drive
out?"
"I
can't
go
into
the
specifics
on
the
phone,
but
we
have
a
situation
here
that
could
potentially
be
extremely
unfortunate
for
the
bank.
"What
do
you
need
me
to
do,
sir?"
"I'd
like
you
to
activate
the
truck's
emergency
transponder."
The
night
manager's
eyes
moved
to
the
LoJack
control
box
across
the
room.
Like
many
armored
cars,
each
of
the
bank's
trucks
had
been
equipped
with
a
radio
controlled
homing
device,
which
could
be
activated
remotely
from
the
bank.
The
manager
had
only
used
the
emergency
system
once,
after
a
hijacking,
and
it
had
worked
flawlessly
locating
the
truck
and
transmitting
the
coordinates
to
the
authorities
automatically.
Tonight,
however,
the
manager
had
the
impression
the
president
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
prudence.
"Sir,
you
are
aware
that
if
I
activate
the
LoJack
system,
the
transponder
will
simultaneously
inform
the
authorities
that
we
have
a
problem."
Vernet
was
silent
for
several
seconds.
"Yes,
I
know.
Do
it
anyway.
Truck
number
three.
I'll
hold.
I
need
the
exact
location
of
that
truck
the
instant
you
have
it."
"Right
away,
sir."
Thirty
seconds
later,
forty
kilometers
away,
hidden
in
the
undercarriage
of
the
armored
truck,
a
tiny
transponder
blinked
to
life.
As
Langdon
and
Sophie
drove
the
armored
truck
up
the
winding,
poplar
lined
driveway
toward
the
house,
Sophie
could
already
feel
her
muscles
relaxing.
It
was
a
relief
to
be
off
the
road,
and
she
could
think
of
few
safer
places
to
get
their
feet
under
them
than
this
private,
gated
estate
owned
by
a
good
natured
foreigner.
They
turned
into
the
sweeping
circular
driveway,
and
Chateau
Villette
came
into
view
on
their
right.
Three
stories
tall
and
at
least
sixty
meters
long,
the
edifice
had
gray
stone
facing
illuminated
by
outside
spotlights.
The
coarse
facade
stood
in
stark
juxtaposition
to
the
immaculately
landscaped
gardens
and
glassy
pond.
The
inside
lights
were
just
now
coming
on.
Rather
than
driving
to
the
front
door,
Langdon
pulled
into
a
parking
area
nestled
in
the
evergreens.
"No
reason
to
risk
being
spotted
from
the
road,"
he
said.
"Or
having
Leigh
wonder
why
we
arrived
in
a
wrecked
armored
truck."
Sophie
nodded.
"What
do
we
do
with
the
cryptex?
We
probably
shouldn't
leave
it
out
here,
but
if
Leigh
sees
it,
he'll
certainly
want
to
know
what
it
is."
"Not
to
worry,"
Langdon
said,
removing
his
jacket
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
car.
He
wrapped
the
tweed
coat
around
the
box
and
held
the
bundle
in
his
arms
like
a
baby.
Sophie
looked
dubious.
"Subtle."
"Teabing
never
answers
his
own
door;
he
prefers
to
make
an
entrance.
I'll
find
somewhere
inside
to
stash
this
before
he
joins
us."
Langdon
paused.
"Actually,
I
should
probably
warn
you
before
you
meet
him.
Sir
Leigh
has
a
sense
of
humor
that
people
often
find
a
bit
strange."
Sophie
doubted
anything
tonight
would
strike
her
as
strange
anymore.
The
pathway
to
the
main
entrance
was
hand
laid
cobblestone.
It
curved
to
a
door
of
carved
oak
and
cherry
with
a
brass
knocker
the
size
of
a
grapefruit.
Before
Sophie
could
grasp
the
knocker,
the
door
swung
open
from
within.
A
prim
and
elegant
butler
stood
before
them,
making
final
adjustments
on
the
white
tie
and
tuxedo
he
had
apparently
just
donned.
He
looked
to
be
about
fifty,
with
refined
features
and
an
austere
expression
that
left
little
doubt
he
was
unamused
by
their
presence
here.
"Sir
Leigh
will
be
down
presently,"
he
declared,
his
accent
thick
French.
"He
is
dressing.
He
prefers
not
to
greet
visitors
while
wearing
only
a
nightshirt.
May
I
take
your
coat?"
He
scowled
at
the
bunched
up
tweed
in
Langdon'
s
arms.
"Thank
you,
I'm
fine."
"Of
course
you
are.
Right
this
way,
please."
The
butler
guided
them
through
a
lush
marble
foyer
into
an
exquisitely
adorned
drawing
room,
softly
lit
by
tassel
draped
Victorian
lamps.
The
air
inside
smelled
antediluvian,
regal
somehow,
with
traces
of
pipe
tobacco,
tea
leaves,
cooking
sherry,
and
the
earthen
aroma
of
stone
architecture.
Against
the
far
wall,
flanked
between
two
glistening
suits
of
chain
mail
armor,
was
a
rough
hewn
fireplace
large
enough
to
roast
an
ox.
Walking
to
the
hearth,
the
butler
knelt
and
touched
a
match
to
a
pre
laid
arrangement
of
oak
logs
and
kindling.
A
fire
quickly
crackled
to
life.
The
man
stood,
straightening
his
jacket.
"His
master
requests
that
you
make
yourselves
at
home."
With
that,
he
departed,
leaving
Langdon
and
Sophie
alone.
Sophie
wondered
which
of
the
fireside
antiques
she
was
supposed
to
sit
on
the
Renaissance
velvet
divan,
the
rustic
eagle
claw
rocker,
or
the
pair
of
stone
pews
that
looked
like
they'd
been
lifted
from
some
Byzantine
temple.
Langdon
unwrapped
the
cryptex
from
his
coat,
walked
to
the
velvet
divan,
and
slid
the
wooden
box
deep
underneath
it,
well
out
of
sight.
Then,
shaking
out
his
jacket,
he
put
it
back
on,
smoothed
the
lapels,
and
smiled
at
Sophie
as
he
sat
down
directly
over
the
stashed
treasure.
The
divan
it
is,
Sophie
thought,
taking
a
seat
beside
him.
As
she
stared
into
the
growing
fire,
enjoying
the
warmth,
Sophie
had
the
sensation
that
her
grandfather
would
have
loved
this
room.
The
dark
wood
paneling
was
bedecked
with
Old
Master
paintings,
one
of
which
Sophie
recognized
as
a
Poussin,
her
grandfather's
second
favorite
painter.
On
the
mantel
above
the
fireplace,
an
alabaster
bust
of
Isis
watched
over
the
room.
Beneath
the
Egyptian
goddess,
inside
the
fireplace,
two
stone
gargoyles
served
as
andirons,
their
mouths
gaping
to
reveal
their
menacing
hollow
throats.
Gargoyles
had
always
terrified
Sophie
as
a
child;
that
was,
until
her
grandfather
cured
her
of
the
fear
by
taking
her
atop
Notre
Dame
Cathedral
in
a
rainstorm.
"Princess,
look
at
these
silly
creatures,"
he
had
told
her,
pointing
to
the
gargoyle
rainspouts
with
their
mouths
gushing
water.
"Do
you
hear
that
funny
sound
in
their
throats?"
Sophie
nodded,
having
to
smile
at
the
burping
sound
of
the
water
gurgling
through
their
throats.
"They're
gargling,
"
her
grandfather
told
her.
"Gargariser!
And
that's
where
they
get
the
silly
name
'gargoyles.'
"
Sophie
had
never
again
been
afraid.
The
fond
memory
caused
Sophie
a
pang
of
sadness
as
the
harsh
reality
of
the
murder
gripped
her
again.
Grand
pere
is
gone.
She
pictured
the
cryptex
under
the
divan
and
wondered
if
Leigh
Teabing
would
have
any
idea
how
to
open
it.
Or
if
we
even
should
ask
him.
Sophie's
grandfather's
final
words
had
instructed
her
to
find
Robert
Langdon.
He
had
said
nothing
about
involving
anyone
else.
We
needed
somewhere
to
hide,
Sophie
said,
deciding
to
trust
Robert's
judgment.
"Sir
Robert!"
a
voice
bellowed
somewhere
behind
them.
"I
see
you
travel
with
a
maiden."
Langdon
stood
up.
Sophie
jumped
to
her
feet
as
well.
The
voice
had
come
from
the
top
of
a
curled
staircase
that
snaked
up
to
the
shadows
of
the
second
floor.
At
the
top
of
the
stairs,
a
form
moved
in
the
shadows,
only
his
silhouette
visible.
"Good
evening,"
Langdon
called
up.
"Sir
Leigh,
may
I
present
Sophie
Neveu."
"An
honor."
Teabing
moved
into
the
light.
"Thank
you
for
having
us,"
Sophie
said,
now
seeing
the
man
wore
metal
leg
braces
and
used
crutches.
He
was
coming
down
one
stair
at
a
time.
"I
realize
it's
quite
late."
"It
is
so
late,
my
dear,
it's
early."
He
laughed.
"Vous
n'etes
pas
Americaine?"
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"Parisienne.
"Your
English
is
superb."
"Thank
you.
I
studied
