doorway
into
his
living
room.
Inside,
he
paused,
admiring
his
spectacular
painting
of
the
Three
Graces
and
savoring
the
familiar
smells
and
sounds
of
his
home.
Soon
I
will
be
leaving
forever.
Mal'akh
knew
that
after
tonight
he
would
be
unable
to
return
to
this
place.
After
tonight,
he
thought,
smiling,
/
will
have
no
need
for
this
place.
He
wondered
if
Robert
Langdon
yet
understood
the
true
power
of
the
pyramid
or
the
importance
of
the
role
for
which
fate
had
chosen
him.
Langdon
has
yet
to
call
me,
Mal'akh
thought,
after
double-checking
for
messages
on
his
disposable
phone.
It
was
now
10:02
P.M.
He
has
less
than
two
hours.
Mal'akh
went
upstairs
to
his
Italian-marble
bathroom
and
turned
on
the
steam
shower
to
let
it
heat
up.
Methodically,
he
stripped
off
his
clothes,
eager
to
begin
his
cleansing
ritual.
He
drank
two
glasses
of
water
to
calm
his
starving
stomach.
Then
he
walked
to
the
full-length
mirror
and
studied
his
naked
body.
His
two
days
of
fasting
had
accentuated
his
musculature,
and
he
could
not
help
but
admire
that
which
he
had
become.
By
dawn,
I
will
be
so
much
more.
"We
should
get
out
of
here,"
Langdon
said
to
Katherine.
"It's
only
a
matter
of
time
before
they
figure
out
where
we
are."
He
hoped
Bellamy
had
managed
to
escape.
Katherine
still
seemed
fixated
on
the
gold
capstone,
looking
incredulous
that
the
inscription
was
so
unhelpful.
She
had
taken
the
capstone
out
of
the
box,
examined
every
side,
and
was
now
carefully
putting
it
back
in
the
box.
The
secret
hides
within
The
Order,
Langdon
thought.
Big
help.
Langdon
found
himself
wondering
now
if
perhaps
Peter
had
been
misinformed
about
the
contents
of
the
box.
This
pyramid
and
capstone
had
been
created
long
before
Peter
was
born,
and
Peter
was
simply
doing
as
his
forefathers
had
told
him,
keeping
a
secret
that
was
probably
as
much
a
mystery
to
him
as
it
was
to
Langdon
and
Katherine.
What
did
I
expect?
Langdon
wondered.
The
more
he
learned
tonight
about
the
Legend
of
the
Masonic
Pyramid,
the
less
plausible
it
all
seemed.
I'm
searching
for
a
hidden
spiral
staircase
covered
by
a
huge
stone?
Something
told
Langdon
he
was
chasing
shadows.
Nonetheless,
deciphering
this
pyramid
seemed
his
best
chance
at
saving
Peter.
"Robert,
does
the
year
1514
mean
anything
to
you?"
Fifteen-fourteen?
The
question
seemed
apropos
of
nothing.
Langdon
shrugged.
"No.
Why?"
Katherine
handed
him
the
stone
box.
"Look.
The
box
is
dated.
Have
a
look
under
the
light."
Langdon
took
a
seat
at
the
desk
and
studied
the
cube-
shaped
box
beneath
the
light.
Katherine
put
a
soft
hand
on
his
shoulder,
leaning
in
to
point
out
the
tiny
text
she
had
found
carved
on
the
exterior
of
the
box,
near
the
bottom
corner
of
one
side.
"Fifteen-fourteen
A.D.,"
she
said,
pointing
into
the
box.
Sure
enough,
the
carving
depicted
the
number
1514,
followed
by
an
unusual
stylization
of
the
letters
A
and
I).
"This
date,"
Katherine
was
saying,
sounding
suddenly
hopeful,
"maybe
it's
the
link
we're
missing?
This
dated
cube
looks
a
lot
like
a
Masonic
cornerstone,
so
maybe
it's
pointing
to
a
real
cornerstone?
Maybe
to
a
building
built
in
1514
A.D.?"
Langdon
barely
heard
her.
Fifteen-fourteen
A.D.
is
not
a
date.
The
symbol
IK
,
as
any
scholar
of
medieval
art
would
recognize,
was
a
well-known
symbature
a
symbol
used
in
place
of
a
signature.
Many
of
the
early
philosophers,
artists,
and
authors
signed
their
work
with
their
own
unique
symbol
or
monogram
rather
than
their
name.
This
practice
added
a
mysterious
allure
to
their
work
and
also
protected
them
from
persecution
should
their
writings
or
artwork
be
deemed
counterestablishment.
In
the
case
of
this
symbature,
the
letters
A.D.
did
not
stand
for
Anno
Domini
they
were
German
for
something
else
entirely.
Langdon
instantly
saw
all
the
pieces
fall
into
place.
Within
seconds,
he
was
certain
he
knew
exactly
how
to
decipher
the
pyramid.
"Katherine,
you
did
it,"
he
said,
packing
up.
"That's
all
we
needed.
Let's
go.
I'll
explain
on
the
way."
Katherine
looked
amazed.
"The
date
1514
A.D.
actually
means
something
to
you?"
Langdon
winked
at
her
and
headed
for
the
door.
"A.D.
isn't
a
date,
Katherine.
It's
a
person."
West
of
Embassy
Row,
all
was
silent
again
inside
the
walled
garden
with
its
twelfth-century
roses
and
Shadow
House
gazebo.
On
the
other
side
of
an
entry
road,
the
young
man
was
helping
his
hunched
superior
walk
across
an
expansive
lawn.
He's
letting
me
guide
him?
Normally,
the
blind
old
man
refused
help,
preferring
to
navigate
by
memory
alone
while
on
the
grounds
of
his
sanctuary.
Tonight,
however,
he
was
apparently
in
a
hurry
to
get
inside
and
return
Warren
Bellamy's
phone
call.
"Thank
you,"
the
old
man
said
as
they
entered
the
building
that
held
his
private
study.
"I
can
find
my
way
from
here."
"Sir,
I
would
be
happy
to
stay
and
help
"That's
all
for
tonight,"
he
said,
letting
go
of
his
helper's
arm
and
shuffling
hurriedly
off
into
the
darkness.
"Goodnight."
The
young
man
exited
the
building
and
walked
back
across
the
great
lawn
to
his
modest
dwelling
on
the
grounds.
By
the
time
he
entered
his
flat,
he
could
feel
his
curiosity
gnawing
at
him.
The
old
man
clearly
had
been
upset
by
the
question
posed
by
Mr.
Bellamy
and
yet
the
question
had
seemed
strange,
almost
meaningless.
Is
there
no
help
for
the
widow's
son?
In
his
wildest
imagination,
he
could
not
guess
what
this
could
mean.
Puzzled,
he
went
to
his
computer
and
typed
in
a
search
for
this
precise
phrase.
To
his
great
surprise,
page
after
page
of
references
appeared,
all
citing
this
exact
question.
He
read
the
information
in
wonderment.
It
seemed
Warren
Bellamy
was
not
the
first
person
in
history
to
ask
this
strange
question.
These
same
words
had
been
uttered
centuries
ago
by
King
Solomon
as
he
mourned
a
murdered
friend.
The
question
was
allegedly
still
spoken
today
by
Masons,
who
used
it
as
a
kind
of
encoded
cry
for
help.
Warren
Bellamy,
it
seemed,
was
sending
a
distress
call
to
a
fellow
Mason.
Albrecht
DUrer?
Katherine
was
trying
to
put
the
pieces
together
as
she
hurried
with
Langdon
through
the
basement
of
the
Adams
Building.
A.D.
stands
for
Albrecht
Durer?
The
famous
sixteenth-century
German
engraver
and
painter
was
one
of
her
brother's
favorite
artists,
and
Katherine
was
vaguely
familiar
with
his
work.
Even
so,
she
could
not
imagine
how
Diner
would
be
any
help
to
them
in
this
case.
For
one
thing,
he's
been
dead
more
than
four
hundred
years.
"Durer
is
symbolically
perfect,"
Langdon
was
saying
as
they
followed
the
trail
of
illuminated
EXIT
signs.
"He
was
the
ultimate
Renaissance
mind
artist,
philosopher,
alchemist,
and
a
lifelong
student
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries.
To
this
day,
nobody
fully
understands
the
messages
hidden
in
Diirer's
art."
"That
may
be
true,"
she
said.
"But
how
does
'1514
Albrecht
Durer'
explain
how
to
decipher
the
pyramid?"
They
reached
a
locked
door,
and
Langdon
used
Bellamy's
key
card
to
get
through.
"The
number
1514,"
Langdon
said
as
they
hurried
up
the
stairs,
"is
pointing
us
to
a
very
specific
piece
of
Diirer's
work."
They
came
into
a
huge
corridor.
Langdon
glanced
around
and
then
pointed
left.
"This
way."
They
moved
quickly
again.
"Albrecht
Durer
actually
hid
the
number
1514
in
his
most
mysterious
piece
of
art
Melencolia
I
which
he
completed
in
the
year
1514.
It's
considered
the
seminal
work
of
the
Northern
European
Renaissance."
Peter
had
once
shown
Katherine
Melencolia
I
in
an
old
book
on
ancient
mysticism,
but
she
didn't
recall
any
hidden
number
1514.
"As
you
may
know,"
Langdon
said,
sounding
excited,
"Melencolia
/
depicts
mankind's
struggle
to
comprehend
the
Ancient
Mysteries.
The
symbolism
in
Melencolia
I
is
so
complex
it
makes
Leonardo
da
Vinci
look
overt."
Katherine
stopped
abruptly
and
looked
at
Langdon.
"Robert,
Melencolia
I
is
here
in
Washington.
It
hangs
in
the
National
Gallery."
"Yes,"
he
said
with
a
smile,
"and
something
tells
me
that's
not
a
coincidence.
The
gallery
is
closed
at
this
hour,
but
I
know
the
curator
and
"Forget
it,
Robert,
I
know
what
happens
when
you
go
to
museums."
Katherine
headed
off
into
a
nearby
alcove,
where
she
saw
a
desk
with
a
computer.
Langdon
followed,
looking
unhappy.
"Let's
do
this
the
easier
way."
It
seemed
Professor
Langdon,
the
art
connoisseur,
was
having
an
ethical
dilemma
about
using
the
Internet
when
an
original
was
so
nearby.
Katherine
stepped
behind
the
desk
and
powered
up
the
computer.
When
the
machine
finally
came
to
life,
she
realized
she
had
another
problem.
"There's
no
icon
for
a
browser."
"It's
an
internal
library
network."
Langdon
pointed
to
an
icon
on
the
desktop.
"Try
that."
Katherine
clicked
on
the
icon
marked
DIGITAL
COLLECTIONS.
The
computer
accessed
a
new
screen,
and
Langdon
pointed
again.
Katherine
clicked
on
his
choice
of
icon:
FINE
PRINTS
COLLECTION.
The
screen
refreshed.
FINE
PRINTS:
SEARCH.
"Type
in
'Albrecht
Durer.'
Katherine
entered
the
name
and
then
clicked
the
search
key.
Within
seconds,
the
screen
began
displaying
a
series
of
thumbnail
images.
All
of
the
images
looked
to
be
similar
in
style
intricate
black-and-white
engravings.
Durer
had
apparently
done
dozens
of
similar
engravings.
Katherine
scanned
the
alphabetical
list
of
his
artwork.
Adam
and
Eve
Betrayal
of
Christ
Four
Horsemen
of
the
Apocalypse
Great
Passion
Last
Supper
Seeing
all
the
biblical
titles,
Katherine
recalled
that
Durer
practiced
something
called
Mystic
Christianity
a
fusion
of
early
Christianity,
alchemy,
astrology,
and
science.
Science
The
image
of
her
lab
in
flames
rushed
through
her
mind.
She
could
barely
process
the
long-term
ramifications,
but
for
the
moment,
her
thoughts
turned
to
her
assistant,
Trish.
/
hope
she
made
it
out.
Langdon
was
saying
something
about
Durer'
s
version
of
the
Last
Supper,
but
Katherine
was
barely
listening.
She
had
just
seen
the
link
for
Melencolia
I.
She
clicked
the
mouse,
and
the
page
refreshed
with
general
information.
Melencolia
I,
1514
Albrecht
Durer
(engraving
on
laid
paper)
Rosenwald
Collection
National
Gallery
of
Art
Washington,
D.C.
When
she
scrolled
down,
a
high-res
digital
image
of
Durer'
s
masterpiece
appeared
in
all
its
glory.
Katherine
stared
in
bewilderment,
having
forgotten
just
how
strange
it
was.
Langdon
gave
an
understanding
chuckle.
"As
I
said,
it's
cryptic."
Melencolia
I
consisted
of
a
brooding
figure
with
giant
wings,
seated
in
front
of
a
stone
building,
surrounded
by
the
most
disparate
and
bizarre
collection
of
objects
imaginable
measuring
scales,
an
emaciated
dog,
carpenter's
tools,
an
hourglass,
various
geometric
solids,
a
hanging
bell,
a
putto,
a
blade,
a
ladder.
Katherine
vaguely
recalled
her
brother
telling
her
that
the
winged
figure
was
a
representation
of
"human
genius"
a
great
thinker
with
chin
in
hand,
looking
depressed,
still
unable
to
achieve
enlightenment.
The
genius
is
surrounded
with
all
of
the
symbols
of
his
human
intellect
objects
of
science,
math,
philosophy,
nature,
geometry,
even
carpentry
and
yet
is
still
unable
to
climb
the
ladder
to
true
enlightenment.
Even
the
human
genius
has
difficulty
comprehending
the
Ancient
Mysteries.
"Symbolically,"
Langdon
said,
"this
represents
mankind's
failed
attempt
to
transform
human
intellect
into
godlike
power.
In
alchemical
terms,
it
represents
our
inability
to
turn
lead
into
gold."
"Not
a
particularly
encouraging
message,"
Katherine
agreed.
"So
how
does
it
help
us?"
She
did
not
see
the
hidden
number
1514
that
Langdon
was
talking
about.
"Order
from
chaos,"
Langdon
said,
flashing
a
lopsided
grin.
"Just
as
your
brother
promised."
He
reached
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
grid
of
letters
he
had
written
earlier
from
the
Masonic
cipher.
"Right
now,
this
grid
is
meaningless."
He
spread
the
paper
out
on
the
desk.
S
O
E
I
A
I
I
\
C
S
A
S

Katherine
eyed
the
grid.
Definitely
meaningless.
"But
Diirer
will
transform
it."
"And
how
might
he
do
that?"
"Linguistic
alchemy."
Langdon
motioned
to
the
computer
screen.
"Look
carefully.
Hidden
in
this
masterpiece
is
something
that
will
make
sense
of
our
sixteen
letters."
He
waited.
"Do
you
see
it
yet?
Look
for
the
number
1514."
Katherine
was
in
no
mood
to
play
classroom.
"Robert,
I
see
nothing
an
orb,
a
ladder,
a
knife,
a
polyhedron,
a
scale?
I
give
up."
"Look!
There
in
the
background.
Carved
into
that
building
behind
the
angel?
Beneath
the
bell?
Diirer
engraved
a
square
that
is
full
of
numbers."
Katherine
now
saw
the
square
that
contained
numbers,
among
them
1514.
"Katherine,
that
square
is
the
key
to
deciphering
the
pyramid!"
She
shot
him
a
surprised
look.
"That's
not
just
any
square,"
Langdon
said,
grinning.
"That,
Ms.
Solomon,
is
a
magic
square."
Where
the
hell
are
they
taking
me?
Bellamy
was
still
blindfolded
in
the
back
of
an
SUV.
After
a
short
stop
somewhere
close
to
the
Library
of
Congress,
the
vehicle
had
continued
on
but
only
for
a
minute.
Now
the
SUV
had
stopped
again,
having
again
traveled
only
about
a
block.
Bellamy
heard
muffled
voices
talking.
"Sorry
impossible"
an
authoritative
voice
was
saying.
"closed
at
this
hour"
The
man
driving
the
SUV
replied
with
equal
authority.
"CIA
investigation
national
security"
Apparently
the
exchange
of
words
and
IDs
was
persuasive,
because
the
tone
shifted
immediately.
"Yes,
of
course
service
entrance"
There
was
the
loud
grinding
of
what
sounded
like
a
garage
door,
and
as
it
opened,
the
voice
added,
"Shall
I
accompany
you?
Once
you're
inside,
you
won't
be
able
to
get
through"
"No.
We
have
access
already."
If
the
guard
was
surprised,
it
was
too
late.
The
SUV
was
moving
again.
It
advanced
about
fifty
yards
and
then
came
to
a
stop.
The
heavy
door
rumbled
closed
again
behind
them.
Silence.
Bellamy
realized
he
was
trembling.
With
a
bang,
the
SUV's
rear
hatch
flew
open.
Bellamy
felt
a
sharp
pain
in
his
shoulders
as
someone
dragged
him
out
by
his
arms,
then
lifted
him
to
his
feet.
Without
a
word,
a
powerful
force
led
him
across
a
wide
expanse
of
pavement.
There
was
a
strange,
earthy
smell
here
that
he
could
not
place.
There
were
footsteps
of
someone
else
walking
with
them,
but
whoever
it
was
had
yet
to
speak.
They
stopped
at
a
door,
and
Bellamy
heard
an
electronic
ping.
The
door
clicked
open.
Bellamy
was
manhandled
through
several
corridors
and
could
not
help
but
notice
that
the
air
was
warmer
and
more
humid.
An
indoor
pool,
maybe?
No.
The
smell
in
the
air
was
not
chlorine
it
was
far
more
earthy
and
primal.
Where
the
hell
are
we?!
Bellamy
knew
he
could
not
be
more
than
a
block
or
two
from
the
Capitol
Building.
Again
they
stopped,
and
again
he
heard
the
electronic
beep
of
a
security
door.
This
one
slid
open
with
a
hiss.
As
they
pushed
him
through,
the
smell
that
hit
him
was
unmistakable.
Bellamy
now
realized
where
they
were.
My
God!
He
came
here
often,
although
never
through
the
service
entrance.
This
magnificent
glass
building
was
only
three
hundred
yards
from
the
Capitol
Building
and
was
technically
part
of
the
Capitol
Complex.
/
run
this
place!
Bellamy
now
realized
it
was
his
own
key
fob
that
was
giving
them
access.
Powerful
arms
pushed
him
through
the
doorway,
leading
him
down
a
familiar,
winding
walkway.
The
heavy,
damp
warmth
of
this
place
usually
felt
comforting
to
him.
Tonight,
he
was
sweating.
What
are
we
doing
here?!
Bellamy
was
halted
suddenly
and
seated
on
a
bench.
The
man
with
the
muscles
unhooked
his
handcuffs
only
long
enough
to
reaffix
them
to
the
bench
behind
his
back.
"What
do
you
want
from
me?"
Bellamy
demanded,
heart
pounding
wildly.
The
only
response
he
received
was
the
sound
of
boots
walking
off
and
the
glass
door
sliding
shut.
Then
silence.
Dead
silence.
They're
just
going
to
leave
me
here?
Bellamy
was
sweating
more
heavily
now
as
he
struggled
to
release
his
hands.
/
can't
even
take
off
my
blindfold?
"Help!"
he
shouted.
"Anybody!"
Even
as
he
called
out
in
panic,
Bellamy
knew
nobody
was
going
to
hear
him.
This
massive
glass
room
known
as
the
Jungle
was
entirely
airtight
when
the
doors
were
closed.
They
left
me
in
the
Jungle,
he
thought.
Nobody
will
find
me
until
morning.
Then
he
heard
it.
The
sound
was
barely
audible,
but
it
terrified
Bellamy
like
no
sound
he
had
ever
heard
in
his
life.
Something
breathing.
Very
close.
He
was
not
alone
on
the
bench.
The
sudden
hiss
of
a
sulfur
match
sizzled
so
close
to
his
face
that
he
could
feel
the
heat.
Bellamy
recoiled,
instinctively
yanking
hard
at
his
chains.
Then,
without
warning,
a
hand
was
on
his
face,
removing
his
blindfold.
The
flame
before
him
reflected
in
the
black
eyes
of
Inoue
Sato
as
she
pressed
the
match
against
the
cigarette
dangling
from
her
lips,
only
inches
away
from
Bellamy's
face.
She
glared
at
him
in
the
moonlight
that
filtered
down
through
the
glass
ceiling.
She
looked
pleased
to
see
his
fear.
"So,
Mr.
Bellamy,"
Sato
said,
shaking
out
the
match.
"Where
shall
we
begin?"
A
magic
square.
Katherine
nodded
as
she
eyed
the
numbered
square
in
Diirer's
engraving.
Most
people
would
have
thought
Langdon
had
lost
his
mind,
but
Katherine
had
quickly
realized
he
was
right.
The
term
magic
square
referred
not
to
something
mystical
but
to
something
mathematical
it
was
the
name
given
to
a
grid
of
consecutive
numbers
arranged
in
such
a
way
that
all
the
rows,
columns,
and
diagonals
added
up
to
the
same
thing.
Created
some
four
thousand
years
ago
by
mathematicians
in
Egypt
and
India,
magic
squares
were
still
believed
by
some
to
hold
magical
powers.
Katherine
had
read
that
even
nowadays
devout
Indians
drew
special
three-by-three
magic
squares
called
the
Kubera
Kolam
on
their
pooja
altars.
Primarily,
though,
modern
man
had
relegated
magic
squares
to
the
category
of
"recreational
mathematics,"
some
people
still
deriving
pleasure
from
the
quest
to
discover
new
"magical"
configurations.
Sudokufor
geniuses.
Katherine
quickly
analyzed
Diirer's
square,
adding
up
the
numbers
in
several
rows
and
columns.

"Thirty-four,"
she
said.
"Every
direction
adds
up
to
thirty-four."
"Exactly,"
Langdon
said.
"But
did
you
know
that
this
magic
square
is
famous
because
Diirer
accomplished
the
seemingly
impossible?"
He
quickly
showed
Katherine
that
in
addition
to
making
the
rows,
columns,
and
diagonals
add
up
to
thirty-four,
Diirer
had
also
found
a
way
to
make
the
four
quadrants,
the
four
center
squares,
and
even
the
four
corner
squares
add
up
to
that
number.
"Most
amazing,
though,
was
Diirer's
ability
to
position
the
numbers
15
and
14
together
in
the
bottom
row
as
an
indication
of
the
year
in
which
he
accomplished
this
incredible
feat!"
Katherine
scanned
the
numbers,
amazed
by
all
the
combinations.
Langdon'
s
tone
grew
more
excited
now.
"Extraordinarily,
Melencolia
/
represents
the
very
first
time
in
history
that
a
magic
square
appeared
in
European
art.
Some
historians
believe
this
was
Diirer'
s
encoded
way
of
indicating
that
the
Ancient
Mysteries
had
traveled
outside
the
Egyptian
Mystery
Schools
and
were
now
held
by
the
European
secret
societies."
Langdon
paused.
"Which
brings
us
back
to
this."
He
motioned
to
the
slip
of
paper
bearing
the
grid
of
letters
from
the
stone
pyramid.

"I
assume
the
layout
looks
familiar
now?"
Langdon
asked.
"Four-by-four
square."
Langdon
picked
up
the
pencil
and
carefully
transcribed
Diirer'
s
numbered
magic
square
onto
the
slip
of
paper,
directly
beside
the
lettered
square.
Katherine
was
now
seeing
just
how
easy
this
was
going
to
be.
He
stood
poised,
pencil
in
hand,
and
yet
strangely,
after
all
this
enthusiasm,
he
seemed
to
hesitate.
"Robert?"
He
turned
to
her,
his
expression
one
of
trepidation.
"Are
you
sure
we
want
to
do
this?
Peter
expressly
"Robert,
if
you
don't
want
to
decipher
this
engraving,
then
/
will."
She
held
out
her
hand
for
the
pencil.
Langdon
could
tell
there
would
be
no
deterring
her
and
so
he
acquiesced,
turning
his
attention
back
to
the
pyramid.
Carefully,
he
superimposed
the
magic
square
over
the
pyramid's
grid
of
letters
and
assigned
each
letter
a
number.
Then
he
created
a
new
grid,
placing
the
Masonic
cipher'
s
letters
in
the
new
order
as
defined
by
the
sequence
in
Diirer'
s
magic
square.
When
Langdon
was
finished,
they
both
examined
the
result.

Katherine
immediately
felt
confused.
"It's
still
gibberish."
Langdon
remained
silent
a
long
moment.
"Actually,
Katherine,
it's
not
gibberish."
His
eyes
brightened
again
with
the
thrill
of
discovery.
"It's
Latin."
In
a
long,
dark
corridor,
an
old
blind
man
shuffled
as
quickly
as
he
could
toward
his
office.
When
he
finally
arrived,
he
collapsed
in
his
desk
chair,
his
old
bones
grateful
for
the
reprieve.
His
answering
machine
was
beeping.
He
pressed
the
button
and
listened.
"It's
Warren
Bellamy,"
said
the
hushed
whisper
of
his
friend
and
Masonic
brother.
"I'm
afraid
I
have
alarming
news"
Katherine
Solomon's
eyes
shot
back
to
the
grid
of
letters,
reexamining
the
text.
Sure
enough,
a
Latin
word
now
materialized
before
her
eyes.
Jeova.

U

Katherine
had
not
studied
Latin,
but
this
word
was
familiar
from
her
reading
of
ancient
Hebrew
texts.
Jeova.
Jehovah.
As
her
eyes
continued
to
trace
downward,
reading
the
grid
like
a
book,
she
was
surprised
to
realize
she
could
read
the
entire
text
of
the
pyramid.
Jeova
Sanctus
Unus.
She
knew
its
meaning
at
once.
This
phrase
was
ubiquitous
in
modern
translations
of
Hebrew
scripture.
In
the
Torah,
the
God
of
the
Hebrews
was
known
by
many
names
Jeova,
Jehovah,
Jeshua,
Yahweh,
the
Source,
the
Elohim
but
many
Roman
translations
had
consolidated
the
confusing
nomenclature
into
a
single
Latin
phrase:
Jeova
Sanctus
Unus.
"One
true
God?"
she
whispered
to
herself.
The
phrase
certainly
did
not
seem
like
something
that
would
help
them
find
her
brother.
"That's
this
pyramid's
secret
message?
One
true
God?
I
thought
this
was
a
map."
Langdon
looked
equally
perplexed,
the
excitement
in
his
eyes
evaporating.
"This
decryption
obviously
is
correct,
but"
"The
man
who
has
my
brother
wants
to
know
a
location."
She
tucked
her
hair
behind
her
ear.
"This
is
not
going
to
make
him
very
happy."
"Katherine,"
Langdon
said,
heaving
a
sigh.
"I've
been
afraid
of
this.
All
night,
I've
had
a
feeling
we're
treating
as
reality
a
collection
of
myths
and
allegories.
Maybe
this
inscription
is
pointing
to
a
metaphorical
location
telling
us
that
the
true
potential
of
man
can
be
accessed
only
through
the
one
true
God."
"But
that
makes
no
sensel"
Katherine
replied,
her
jaw
now
clenched
in
frustration.
"My
family
protected
this
pyramid
for
generations!
One
true
God?
That's
the
secret?
And
the
CIA
considers
this
an
issue
of
national
security?
Either
they're
lying
or
we're
missing
something!"
Langdon
shrugged
in
accord.
Just
then,
his
phone
began
to
ring.
In
a
cluttered
office
lined
with
old
books,
the
old
man
hunched
over
his
desk,
clutching
a
phone
receiver
in
his
arthritic
hand.
The
line
rang
and
rang.
At
last,
a
tentative
voice
answered.
"Hello?"
The
voice
was
deep
but
uncertain.
The
old
man
whispered,
"I
was
told
you
require
sanctuary."
The
man
on
the
line
seemed
startled.
"Who
is
this?
Did
Warren
Bell
"No
names,
please,"
the
old
man
said.
"Tell
me,
have
you
successfully
protected
the
map
that
was
entrusted
to
you?"
A
startled
pause.
"Yes
but
I
don't
think
it
matters.
It
doesn't
say
much.
If
it
is
a
map,
it
seems
to
be
more
metaphorical
than
"No,
the
map
is
quite
real,
I
assure
you.
And
it
points
to
a
very
real
location.
You
must
keep
it
safe.
I
cannot
impress
upon
you
enough
how
important
this
is.
You
are
being
pursued,
but
if
you
can
travel
unseen
to
my
location,
I
will
provide
sanctuary
and
answers."
The
man
hesitated,
apparently
uncertain.
"My
friend,"
the
old
man
began,
choosing
his
words
carefully.
"There
is
a
refuge
in
Rome,
north
of
the
Tiber,
which
contains
ten
stones
from
Mount
Sinai,
one
from
heaven
itself,
and
one
with
the
visage
of
Luke's
dark
father.
Do
you
know
my
location?"
There
was
a
long
pause
on
the
line,
and
then
the
man
replied,
"Yes,
I
do."
The
old
man
smiled.
/
thought
you
might,
Professor.
"Come
at
once.
Make
sure
you're
not
followed."
Mal'akh
stood
naked
in
the
billowing
warmth
of
his
steam
shower.
He
felt
pure
again,
having
washed
off
the
last
remaining
scent
of
ethanol.
As
the
eucalyptus-infused
vapors
permeated
his
skin,
he
could
feel
his
pores
opening
to
the
heat.
Then
he
began
his
ritual.
First,
he
rubbed
depilatory
chemicals
across
his
tattooed
body
and
scalp,
removing
any
traces
of
body
hair.
Hairless
were
the
gods
of
the
seven
islands
ofHeliades.
Then
he
massaged
Abramelin
oil
into
his
softened
and
receptive
flesh.
Abramelin
is
the
sacred
oil
of
the
great
Magi.
Then
he
turned
his
shower
lever
hard
to
the
left,
and
the
water
turned
ice
cold.
He
stood
beneath
the
frigid
water
for
a
full
minute
to
close
his
pores
and
trap
the
heat
and
energy
within
his
core.
The
cold
served
as
a
reminder
of
the
icy
river
in
which
this
transformation
had
begun.
When
he
stepped
from
the
shower,
he
was
shivering,
but
within
seconds,
his
core
heat
emanated
up
through
his
layers
of
flesh
and
warmed
him.
Mal'akh's
insides
felt
like
a
furnace.
He
stood
naked
before
the
mirror
and
admired
his
form
perhaps
the
last
time
he
would
see
himself
as
a
mere
mortal.
His
feet
were
the
talons
of
a
hawk.
His
legs
Boaz
and
Jachin
were
the
ancient
pillars
of
wisdom.
His
hips
and
abdomen
were
the
archways
of
mystical
power.
Hanging
beneath
the
archway,
his
massive
sex
organ
bore
the
tattooed
symbols
of
his
destiny.
In
another
life,
this
heavy
shaft
of
flesh
had
been
his
source
of
carnal
pleasure.
But
no
longer.
/
have
been
purified.
Like
the
mystical
eunuch
monks
of
Katharoi,
Mal'akh
had
removed
his
testicles.
He
had
sacrificed
his
physical
potency
for
a
more
worthy
one.
Gods
have
no
gender.
Having
shed
the
human
imperfection
of
gender
along
with
the
earthly
pull
of
sexual
temptation,
Mal'akh
had
become
like
Ouranos,
Attis,
Sporas,
and
the
great
castrati
magicians
of
Arthurian
legend.
Every
spiritual
metamorphosis
is
preceded
by
a
physical
one.
Such
was
the
lesson
of
all
the
great
gods
from
Osiris,
to
Tammuz,
to
Jesus,
to
Shiva,
to
the
Buddha
himself.
/
must
shed
the
man
who
clothes
me.
Abruptly,
Mal'akh
drew
his
gaze
upward,
past
the
double-headed
phoenix
on
his
chest,
past
the
collage
of
ancient
sigils
adorning
his
face,
and
directly
to
the
top
of
his
head.
He
tipped
his
head
toward
the
mirror,
barely
able
to
see
the
circle
of
bare
flesh
that
waited
there.
This
location
on
the
body
was
sacred.
Known
as
the
fontanel,
it
was
the
one
area
of
the
human
skull
that
remained
open
at
birth.
An
oculus
to
the
brain.
Although
this
physiological
portal
closes
within
a
matter
of
months,
it
remains
a
symbolic
vestige
of
the
lost
connection
between
the
outer
and
inner
worlds.
Mal'akh
studied
the
sacred
patch
of
virginal
skin,
which
was
enclosed
by
the
crownlike
circle
of
an
ouroboros
a
mystical
snake
devouring
its
own
tail.
The
bare
flesh
seemed
to
stare
back
at
him
bright
with
promise.
Robert
Langdon
soon
would
uncover
the
great
treasure
that
Mal'akh
required.
Once
Mal'akh
possessed
it,
the
void
on
top
of
his
head
would
be
filled,
and
he
would
at
last
be
prepared
for
his
final
transformation.
Mal'akh
padded
across
his
bedroom
and
took
from
his
bottom
drawer
a
long
strip
of
white
silk.
As
he
had
done
many
times
before,
he
wrapped
it
around
his
groin
and
buttocks.
Then
he
went
downstairs.
In
his
office,
his
computer
had
received
an
e-mail
message.
It
was
from
his
contact:
WHAT
YOU
REQUIRE
IS
NOW
WITHIN
REACH.
I
WILL
CONTACT
YOU
WITHIN
THE
HOUR.
PATIENCE.
Mal'akh
smiled.
It
was
time
to
make
final
preparations.
The
CIA
field
agent
was
in
a
foul
mood
as
he
descended
from
the
reading-room
balcony.
Bellamy
lied
to
us.
The
agent
had
seen
no
heat
signatures
whatsoever
upstairs
near
the
Moses
statue,
nor
anywhere
else
upstairs
for
that
matter.
So
where
the
hell
did
Langdon
go
?
The
agent
retraced
his
steps
now
to
the
only
place
they'd
spotted
any
heat
signatures
at
all
the
library's
distribution
hub.
He
descended
the
stairs
again,
moving
beneath
the
octagonal
console.
The
noise
of
the
rumbling
conveyors
was
grating.
Advancing
into
the
space,
he
flipped
down
his
thermal
goggles
and
scanned
the
room.
Nothing.
He
looked
toward
the
stacks,
where
the
mangled
door
still
showed
hot
from
the
explosion.
Other
than
that,
he
saw
no
Holy
shit!
The
agent
jumped
back
as
an
unexpected
luminescence
drifted
into
his
field
of
vision.
Like
a
pair
of
ghosts,
the
dimly
glowing
imprints
of
two
humanoids
had
just
emerged
from
the
wall
on
a
conveyor
belt.
Heat
signatures.
Stunned,
the
agent
watched
as
the
two
apparitions
circled
the
room
on
the
conveyor
loop
and
then
disappeared
headfirst
into
a
narrow
hole
in
the
wall.
They
rode
the
conveyor
out?
That's
insanity.
In
addition
to
realizing
they
had
just
lost
Robert
Langdon
through
a
hole
in
the
wall,
the
field
agent
was
now
aware
that
he
had
another
problem.
Langdon'
s
not
alone?
He
was
just
about
to
switch
on
his
transceiver
and
call
the
team
leader,
but
the
team
leader
beat
him
to
it.
"All
points,
we've
got
an
abandoned
Volvo
on
the
plaza
in
front
of
the
library.
Registered
to
one
Katherine
Solomon.
Eyewitness
says
she
entered
the
library
not
long
ago.
We
suspect
she's
with
Robert
Langdon.
Director
Sato
has
ordered
that
we
find
them
both
immediately."
"I've
got
heat
signatures
for
both
of
them!"
shouted
the
field
agent
in
the
distribution
room.
He
explained
the
situation.
"For
Christ's
sake!"
the
team
leader
replied.
"Where
the
hell
does
the
conveyor
go?"
The
field
agent
was
already
consulting
the
employee
reference
schematic
on
the
bulletin
board.
"Adams
Building,"
he
replied.
"One
block
from
here."
"All
points.
Redirect
to
the
Adams
Building!
NOW!"
Sanctuary.
Answers.
The
words
echoed
in
Langdon
's
mind
as
he
and
Katherine
burst
through
a
side
door
of
the
Adams
Building
and
out
into
the
cold
winter
night.
The
mysterious
caller
had
conveyed
his
location
cryptically,
but
Langdon
had
understood.
Katherine's
reaction
to
their
destination
had
been
surprisingly
sanguine:
Where
better
to
find
One
True
God?
Now
the
question
was
how
to
get
there.
Langdon
spun
in
place,
trying
to
get
his
bearings.
It
was
dark,
but
thankfully
the
weather
had
cleared.
They
were
standing
in
a
small
courtyard.
In
the
distance,
the
Capitol
Dome
looked
startlingly
far
away,
and
Langdon
realized
this
was
the
first
moment
he
had
stepped
outside
since
arriving
at
the
Capitol
several
hours
ago.
So
much
for
my
lecture.
"Robert,
look."
Katherine
pointed
toward
the
silhouette
of
the
Jefferson
Building.
Langdon'
s
first
reaction
on
seeing
the
building
was
astonishment
that
they
had
traveled
so
far
underground
on
a
conveyor
belt.
His
second
reaction,
however,
was
alarm.
The
Jefferson
Building
was
now
abuzz
with
activity
trucks
and
cars
pulling
in,
men
shouting.
Is
that
a
searchlight?
Langdon
grabbed
Katherine'
s
hand.
"Come
on."
They
ran
northeast
across
the
courtyard,
quickly
disappearing
from
view
behind
an
elegant
U-shaped
building,
which
Langdon
realized
was
the
Folger
Shakespeare
Library.
This
particular
building
seemed
appropriate
camouflage
for
them
tonight,
as
it
housed
the
original
Latin
manuscript
of
Francis
Bacon's
New
Atlantis,
the
Utopian
vision
on
which
the
American
forefathers
had
allegedly
modeled
a
new
world
based
on
ancient
knowledge.
Even
so,
Langdon
would
not
be
stopping.
We
need
a
cab.
They
arrived
at
the
corner
of
Third
Street
and
East
Capitol.
The
traffic
was
sparse,
and
Langdon
felt
fading
hope
as
he
scanned
for
taxis.
He
and
Katherine
hurried
northward
on
Third
Street,
putting
distance
between
themselves
and
the
Library
of
Congress.
It
was
not
until
they
had
gone
an
entire
block
that
Langdon
finally
spotted
a
cab
rounding
the
corner.
He
flagged
it
down,
and
the
cab
pulled
over.
Middle
Eastern
music
played
on
his
radio,
and
the
young
Arab
driver
gave
them
a
friendly
smile.
"Where
to?"
the
driver
asked
as
they
jumped
into
the
car.
"We
need
to
go
to"
"Northwest!"
Katherine
interjected,
pointing
up
Third
Street
away
from
the
Jefferson
Building.
"Drive
toward
Union
Station,
then
left
on
Massachusetts
Avenue.
We'll
tell
you
when
to
stop."
The
driver
shrugged,
closed
the
Plexiglas
divider,
and
turned
his
music
back
on.
Katherine
shot
Langdon
an
admonishing
look
as
if
to
say:
"Leave
no
trail."
She
pointed
out
the
window,
directing
Langdon'
s
attention
to
a
black
helicopter
that
was
skimming
in
low,
approaching
the
area.
Shit.
Sato
was
apparently
dead
serious
about
recovering
Solomon's
pyramid.
As
they
watched
the
helicopter
land
between
the
Jefferson
and
Adams
buildings,
Katherine
turned
to
him,
looking
increasingly
worried.
"Can
I
see
your
cell
phone
for
a
second?"
Langdon
handed
her
his
phone.
"Peter
told
me
you
have
an
eidetic
memory?"
she
said,
rolling
down
her
window.
"And
that
you
remember
every
phone
number
you've
ever
dialed?"
"That's
true,
but"
Katherine
hurled
his
phone
out
into
the
night.
Langdon
spun
in
his
seat
and
watched
as
his
cell
phone
cartwheeled
and
splintered
into
pieces
on
the
pavement
behind
them.
"Why
did
you
do
that!"
"Off
the
grid,"
Katherine
said,
her
eyes
grave.
"This
pyramid
is
our
only
hope
of
finding
my
brother,
and
I
have
no
intention
of
letting
the
CIA
steal
it
from
us."
In
the
front
seat,
Omar
Amirana
bobbed
his
head
and
hummed
along
with
his
music.
Tonight
had
been
slow,
and
he
felt
blessed
to
finally
have
a
fare.
His
cab
was
just
passing
Stanton
Park,
when
the
familiar
voice
of
his
company
dispatcher
crackled
over
the
radio.
"This
is
Dispatch.
All
vehicles
in
the
area
of
the
National
Mall.
We
have
just
received
a
bulletin
from
government
authorities
regarding
two
fugitives
in
the
area
of
the
Adams
Building"
Omar
listened
in
amazement
as
Dispatch
described
the
precise
couple
in
his
cab.
He
stole
an
uneasy
glance
in
his
rearview
mirror.
Omar
had
to
admit,
the
tall
guy
did
look
familiar
somehow.
Did
I
see
him
on
America's
Most
Wanted?
Gingerly,
Omar
reached
for
his
radio
handset.
"Dispatch?"
he
said,
speaking
quietly
into
the
transceiver.
"This
is
cab
one-three-four.
The
two
people
you
asked
about
they
are
in
my
cab
right
now."
Dispatch
immediately
advised
Omar
what
to
do.
Omar's
hands
were
trembling
as
he
called
the
phone
number
Dispatch
had
given
him.
The
voice
that
answered
was
tight
and
efficient,
like
that
of
a
soldier.
"This
is
Agent
Turner
Simkins,
CIA
field
ops.
Who
is
this?"
"Um
I'm
the
taxi
driver?"
Omar
said.
"I
was
told
to
call
about
the
two
"Are
the
fugitives
currently
in
your
vehicle?
Answer
only
yes
or
no."
"Yes."
"Can
they
hear
this
conversation?
Yes
or
no?"
"No.
The
slider
is"
"Where
are
you
taking
them?"
"Northwest
on
Massachusetts."
"Specific
destination?"
"They
didn't
say."
The
agent
hesitated.
"Is
the
male
passenger
carrying
a
leather
bag?"
Omar
glanced
in
the
rearview
mirror,
and
his
eyes
went
wide.
"Yes!
That
bag
doesn't
have
explosives
or
anything
in
"Listen
carefully,"
the
agent
said.
"You
are
in
no
danger
so
long
as
you
follow
my
directions
exactly.
Is
that
clear?"
"Yes,
sir."
"What
is
your
name?"
"Omar,"
he
said,
breaking
a
sweat.
"Listen,
Omar,"
the
man
said
calmly.
"You're
doing
great.
I
want
you
to
drive
as
slowly
as
possible
while
I
get
my
team
out
in
front
of
you.
Do
you
understand?"
"Yes,
sir."
"Also,
is
your
cab
equipped
with
an
intercom
system
so
you
can
communicate
with
them
in
the
backseat?"
"Yes,
sir."
"Good.
Here's
what
I
want
you
to
do."
The
Jungle,
as
it
is
known,
is
the
centerpiece
of
the
U.S.
Botanic
Garden
(USBG)
America's
living
museum
located
adjacent
to
the
U.S.
Capitol
Building.
Technically
a
rain
forest,
the
Jungle
is
housed
in
a
towering
greenhouse,
complete
with
soaring
rubber
trees,
strangler
figs,
and
a
canopy
catwalk
for
more
daring
tourists.
Normally,
Warren
Bellamy
felt
nurtured
by
the
Jungle's
earthy
smells
and
the
sunlight
glinting
through
the
mist
that
filtered
down
from
the
vapor
nozzles
in
the
glass
ceiling.
Tonight,
however,
lit
only
by
moonlight,
the
Jungle
terrified
him.
He
was
sweating
profusely,
writhing
against
the
cramps
that
now
stabbed
at
his
arms,
still
pinned
painfully
behind
him.
Director
Sato
paced
before
him,
puffing
calmly
on
her
cigarette
the
equivalent
of
ecoterrorism
in
this
carefully
calibrated
environment.
Her
face
looked
almost
demonic
in
the
smoke-filled
moonlight
that
streamed
down
through
the
glass
ceiling
overhead.
"So
then,"
Sato
continued,
"when
you
arrived
at
the
Capitol
tonight,
and
you
discovered
that
I
was
already
there
you
made
a
decision.
Rather
than
making
your
presence
known
to
me,
you
descended
quietly
into
the
SBB,
where,
at
great
risk
to
yourself,
you
attacked
Chief
Anderson
and
myself,
and
you
helped
Langdon
escape
with
the
pyramid
and
capstone."
She
rubbed
her
shoulder.
"An
interesting
choice."
A
choice
I
would
make
again,
Bellamy
thought.
"Where
is
Peter?"
he
demanded
angrily.
"How
would
/
know?"
Sato
said.
"You
seem
to
know
everything
else!"
Bellamy
fired
back
at
her,
making
no
attempt
to
hide
his
suspicion
that
she
was
somehow
behind
all
this.
"You
knew
to
go
to
the
Capitol
Building.
You
knew
to
find
Robert
Langdon.
And
you
even
knew
to
X-ray
Langdon'
s
bag
to
find
the
capstone.
Obviously,
someone
is
giving
you
a
lot
of
inside
information."
Sato
laughed
coldly
and
stepped
closer
to
him.
"Mr.
Bellamy,
is
that
why
you
attacked
me?
Do
you
think
I'm
the
enemyl
Do
you
think
I'm
trying
to
steal
your
little
pyramid?"
Sato
took
a
drag
on
her
cigarette
and
blew
the
smoke
out
of
her
nostrils.
"Listen
carefully.
No
one
understands
better
than
I
do
the
importance
of
keeping
secrets.
I
believe,
as
you
do,
that
there
is
certain
information
to
which
the
masses
should
not
be
privy.
Tonight,
however,
there
are
forces
at
work
that
I
fear
you
have
not
yet
grasped.
The
man
who
kidnapped
Peter
Solomon
holds
enormous
power
a
power
that
you
apparently
have
yet
to
realize.
Believe
me,
he
is
a
walking
time
bomb
capable
of
initiating
a
series
of
events
that
will
profoundly
change
the
world
as
you
know
it."
"I
don't
understand."
Bellamy
shifted
on
the
bench,
his
arms
aching
in
his
handcuffs.
"You
don't
need
to
understand.
You
need
to
obey.
Right
now,
my
only
hope
of
averting
a
major
disaster
is
to
cooperate
with
this
man
and
to
give
him
exactly
what
he
wants.
Which
means,
you
are
going
to
call
Mr.
Langdon
and
tell
him
to
turn
himself
in,
along
with
the
pyramid
and
capstone.
Once
Langdon
is
in
my
custody,
he
will
decrypt
the
pyramid's
inscription,
obtain
whatever
information
this
man
is
demanding,
and
provide
him
with
exactly
what
he
wants."
The
location
of
the
spiral
staircase
that
leads
to
the
Ancient
Mysteries?
"I
can't
do
that.
I've
taken
vows
of
secrecy."
Sato
erupted.
"I
don't
give
a
damn
what
you've
vowed,
I
will
throw
you
in
prison
so
fast
"Threaten
me
all
you
like,"
Bellamy
said
defiantly.
"I
will
not
help
you."
Sato
took
a
deep
breath
and
spoke
now
in
a
fearsome
whisper.
"Mr.
Bellamy,
you
have
no
idea
what's
really
going
on
tonight,
do
you?"
The
tense
silence
hung
for
several
seconds,
finally
broken
by
the
sound
of
Sato's
phone.
She
plunged
her
hand
into
her
pocket
and
eagerly
snatched
it
out.
"Talk
to
me,"
she
answered,
listening
carefully
to
the
reply.
"Where
is
their
taxi
now?
How
long?
Okay,
good.
Bring
them
to
the
U.S.
Botanic
Garden.
Service
entrance.
And
make
sure
you
get
me
that
god-damn
pyramid
and
capstone."
Sato
hung
up
and
turned
back
to
Bellamy
with
a
smug
smile.
"Well
then
it
seems
you're
fast
outliving
your
usefulness."
Robert
Langdon
stared
blankly
into
space,
feeling
too
tired
to
urge
the
slow-moving
taxi
driver
to
pick
up
the
pace.
Beside
him,
Katherine
had
fallen
silent,
too,
looking
frustrated
by
their
lack
of
understanding
of
what
made
the
pyramid
so
special.
They
had
again
been
through
everything
they
knew
about
the
pyramid,
the
capstone,
and
the
evening's
strange
events;
they
still
had
no
ideas
as
to
how
this
pyramid
could
possibly
be
considered
a
map
to
anything
at
all.
Jeova
Sanctus
Unus?
The
secret
hides
within
The
Order?
Their
mysterious
contact
had
promised
them
answers
if
they
could
meet
him
at
a
specific
place.
A
refuge
in
Rome,
north
of
the
Tiber.
Langdon
knew
the
forefathers'
"new
Rome"
had
been
renamed
Washington
early
in
her
history,
and
yet
vestiges
of
their
original
dream
remained:
the
Tiber's
waters
still
flowed
into
the
Potomac;
senators
still
convened
beneath
a
replica
of
St.
Peter's
dome;
and
Vulcan
and
Minerva
still
watched
over
the
Rotunda's
long-extinguished
flame.
The
answers
sought
by
Langdon
and
Katherine
were
apparently
waiting
for
them
just
a
few
miles
ahead.
Northwest
on
Massachusetts
Avenue.
Their
destination
was
indeed
a
refuge
north
of
Washington'
s
Tiber
Creek.
Langdon
wished
the
driver
would
speed
up.
Abruptly,
Katherine
jolted
upright
in
her
seat,
as
if
she
had
made
a
sudden
realization.
"Oh
my
God,
Robert!"
She
turned
to
him,
her
face
going
white.
She
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
spoke
emphatically.
"We're
going
the
wrong
way!"
"No,
this
is
right,"
Langdon
countered.
"It's
northwest
on
Massachu
"No!
I
mean
we're
going
to
the
wrong
placel"
Langdon
was
mystified.
He
had
already
told
Katherine
how
he
knew
what
location
was
being
described
by
the
mysterious
caller.
It
contains
ten
stones
from
Mount
Sinai,
one
from
heaven
itself,
and
one
with
the
visage
of
Luke's
dark
father.
Only
one
building
on
earth
could
make
those
claims.
And
that
was
exactly
where
this
taxi
was
headed.
"Katherine,
I'm
certain
the
location
is
correct."
"No!"
she
shouted.
"We
don't
need
to
go
there
anymore.
I
figured
out
the
pyramid
and
capstone!
I
know
what
this
is
all
about!"
Langdon
was
amazed.
"You
understand
it?"
"Yes!
We
have
to
go
to
Freedom
Plaza
instead!"
Now
Langdon
was
lost.
Freedom
Plaza,
although
nearby,
seemed
totally
irrelevant.
"Jeova
Sanctus
Unus!"
Katherine
said.
"The
One
True
God
of
the
Hebrews.
The
sacred
symbol
of
the
Hebrews
is
the
Jewish
star
the
Seal
of
Solomon
an
important
symbol
to
the
Masons!"
She
fished
a
dollar
bill
out
of
her
pocket.
"Give
me
your
pen."
Bewildered,
Langdon
pulled
a
pen
from
his
jacket.
"Look."
She
spread
the
bill
out
on
her
thigh
and
took
his
pen,
pointing
to
the
Great
Seal
on
the
back.
"If
you
superimpose
Solomon's
seal
on
the
Great
Seal
of
the
United
States"
She
drew
the
symbol
of
a
Jewish
star
precisely
over
the
pyramid.
"Look
what
you
get!"
Langdon
looked
down
at
the
bill
and
then
back
at
Katherine
as
if
she
were
mad.
"Robert,
look
more
closely!
Don't
you
see
what
I'm
pointing
at?"
He
glanced
back
at
the
drawing.
What
in
the
world
is
she
getting
at?
Langdon
had
seen
this
image
before.
It
was
popular
among
conspiracy
theorists
as
"proof
that
the
Masons
held
secret
influence
over
our
early
nation.
When
the
six-pointed
star
was
laid
perfectly
over
the
Great
Seal
of
the
United
States,
the
star's
top
vertex
fit
perfectly
over
the
Masonic
all-seeing
eye
and,
quite
eerily,
the
other
five
vertices
clearly
pointed
to
the
letters
M-A-S-O-N.
"Katherine,
that's
just
a
coincidence,
and
I
still
don't
see
how
it
has
anything
to
do
with
Freedom
Plaza."
"Look
again!"
she
said,
sounding
almost
angry
now.
"You're
not
looking
where
I
am
pointing!
Right
there.
Don't
you
see
it?"
An
instant
later,
Langdon
saw
it.
CIA
field-operations
leader
Turner
Simkins
stood
outside
the
Adams
Building
and
pressed
his
cell
phone
tightly
to
his
ear,
straining
to
hear
the
conversation
now
taking
place
in
the
back
of
the
taxi.
Something
just
happened.
His
team
was
about
to
board
the
modified
Sikorsky
UH-60
helicopter
to
head
northwest
and
set
up
a
roadblock,
but
now
it
seemed
the
situation
had
suddenly
changed.
Seconds
ago,
Katherine
Solomon
had
begun
insisting
they
were
going
to
the
wrong
destination.
Her
explanation
something
about
the
dollar
bill
and
Jewish
stars
made
no
sense
to
the
team
leader,
nor,
apparently,
to
Robert
Langdon.
At
least
at
first.
Now,
however,
Langdon
seemed
to
have
grasped
her
meaning.
"My
God,
you're
right!"
Langdon
blurted.
"I
didn't
see
it
earlier!"
Suddenly
Simkins
could
hear
someone
banging
on
the
driver's
divider,
and
then
it
slid
open.
"Change
of
plans,"
Katherine
shouted
to
the
driver.
"Take
us
to
Freedom
Plaza!"
"Freedom
Plaza?"
the
cabbie
said,
sounding
nervous.
"Not
northwest
on
Massachusetts?"
"Forget
that!"
Katherine
shouted.
"Freedom
Plaza!
Go
left
here!
Here!
HERE!"
Agent
Simkins
heard
the
cab
screeching
around
a
corner.
Katherine
was
talking
excitedly
again
to
Langdon,
saying
something
about
the
famous
bronze
cast
of
the
Great
Seal
embedded
in
the
plaza.
"Ma'am,
just
to
confirm,"
the
cabbie's
voice
interjected,
sounding
tense.
"We're
going
to
Freedom
Plaza
on
the
corner
of
Pennsylvania
and
Thirteenth?"
"Yes!"
Katherine
said.
"Hurry!"
"It's
very
close.
Two
minutes."
Simkins
smiled.
Nicely
done,
Omar.
As
he
dashed
toward
the
idling
helicopter,
he
shouted
to
his
team.
"We've
got
them!
Freedom
Plaza!
Move!"
Freedom
Plaza
is
a
map.
Located
at
the
corner
of
Pennsylvania
Avenue
and
Thirteenth
Street,
the
plaza's
vast
surface
of
inlaid
stone
depicts
the
streets
of
Washington
as
they
were
originally
envisioned
by
Pierre
L'Enfant.
The
plaza
is
a
popular
tourist
destination
not
only
because
the
giant
map
is
fun
to
walk
on,
but
also
because
Martin
Luther
King
Jr.,
for
whom
Freedom
Plaza
is
named,
wrote
much
of
his
"I
Have
a
Dream"
speech
in
the
nearby
Willard
Hotel.
D.C.
cabdriver
Omar
Amirana
brought
tourists
to
Freedom
Plaza
all
the
time,
but
tonight,
his
two
passengers
were
obviously
no
ordinary
sightseers.
The
CIA
is
chasing
them?
Omar
had
barely
come
to
a
stop
at
the
curb
before
the
man
and
woman
had
jumped
out.
"Stay
right
here!"
the
man
in
the
tweed
coat
told
Omar.
"We'll
be
right
back!"
Omar
watched
the
two
people
dash
out
onto
the
wide-open
spaces
of
the
enormous
map,
pointing
and
shouting
as
they
scanned
the
geometry
of
intersecting
streets.
Omar
grabbed
his
cell
phone
off
the
dashboard.
"Sir,
are
you
still
there?"
"Yes,
Omar!"
a
voice
shouted,
barely
audible
over
a
thundering
noise
on
his
end
of
the
line.
"Where
are
they
now?"
"Out
on
the
map.
It
seems
like
they're
looking
for
something."
"Do
not
let
them
out
of
your
sight,"
the
agent
shouted.
"I'm
almost
there!"
Omar
watched
as
the
two
fugitives
quickly
found
the
plaza's
famous
Great
Seal
one
of
the
largest
bronze
medallions
ever
cast.
They
stood
over
it
a
moment
and
quickly
began
pointing
to
the
southwest.
Then
the
man
in
tweed
came
racing
back
toward
the
cab.
Omar
quickly
set
his
phone
down
on
the
dashboard
as
the
man
arrived,
breathless.
"Which
direction
is
Alexandria,
Virginia?"
he
demanded.
"Alexandria?"
Omar
pointed
southwest,
the
exact
same
direction
the
man
and
woman
had
just
pointed
toward.
"I
knew
it!"
the
man
whispered
beneath
his
breath.
He
spun
and
shouted
back
to
the
woman.
"You're
right!
Alexandria!"
The
woman
now
pointed
across
the
plaza
to
an
illuminated
"Metro"
sign
nearby.
"The
Blue
Line
goes
directly
there.
We
want
King
Street
Station!"
Omar
felt
a
surge
of
panic.
Oh
no.
The
man
turned
back
to
Omar
and
handed
him
entirely
too
many
bills
for
the
fare.
"Thanks.
We're
all
set."
He
hoisted
his
leather
bag
and
ran
off.
"Wait!
I
can
drive
you!
I
go
there
all
the
time!"
But
it
was
too
late.
The
man
and
woman
were
already
dashing
across
the
plaza.
They
disappeared
down
the
stairs
into
the
Metro
Center
subway
station.
Omar
grabbed
his
cell
phone.
"Sir!
They
ran
down
into
the
subway!
I
couldn't
stop
them!
They're
taking
the
Blue
Line
to
Alexandria!"
"Stay
right
there!"
the
agent
shouted.
"I'll
be
there
in
fifteen
seconds!"
Omar
looked
down
at
the
wad
of
bills
the
man
had
given
him.
The
bill
on
top
was
apparently
the
one
they
had
been
writing
on.
It
had
a
Jewish
star
on
top
of
the
Great
Seal
of
the
United
States.
Sure
enough,
the
star's
points
fell
on
letters
that
spelled
MASON.
Without
warning,
Omar
felt
a
deafening
vibration
all
around
him,
as
if
a
tractor
trailer
were
about
to
collide
with
his
cab.
He
looked
up,
but
the
street
was
deserted.
The
noise
increased,
and
suddenly
a
sleek
black
helicopter
dropped
down
out
of
the
night
and
landed
hard
in
the
middle
of
the
plaza
map.
A
group
of
black-clad
men
jumped
out.
Most
ran
toward
the
subway
station,
but
one
came
dashing
toward
Omar's
cab.
He
yanked
open
the
passenger
door.
"Omar?
Is
that
you?"
Omar
nodded,
speechless.
"Did
they
say
where
they
were
headed?"
the
agent
demanded.
"Alexandria!
King
Street
Station,"
Omar
blurted.
"I
offered
to
drive,
but
"Did
they
say
where
in
Alexandria
they
were
going?"
"No!
They
looked
at
the
medallion
of
the
Great
Seal
on
the
plaza,
then
they
asked
about
Alexandria,
and
they
paid
me
with
this."
He
handed
the
agent
the
dollar
bill
with
the
bizarre
diagram.
As
the
agent
studied
the
bill,
Omar
suddenly
put
it
all
together.
The
Masons!
Alexandria!
One
of
the
most
famous
Masonic
buildings
in
America
was
in
Alexandria.
"That's
it!"
he
blurted.
"The
George
Washington
Masonic
Memorial!
It's
directly
across
from
King
Street
Station!"
"That
it
is,"
the
agent
said,
apparently
having
just
come
to
the
same
realization
as
the
rest
of
the
agents
came
sprinting
back
from
the
station.
"We
missed
them!"
one
of
the
men
yelled.
"Blue
Line
just
left!
They're
not
down
there!"
Agent
Simkins
checked
his
watch
and
turned
back
to
Omar.
"How
long
does
the
subway
take
to
Alexandria?"
"Ten
minutes
at
least.
Probably
more."
"Omar,
you've
done
an
excellent
job.
Thank
you."
"Sure.
What's
this
all
about?!"
But
Agent
Simkins
was
already
running
back
to
the
chopper,
shouting
as
he
went.
"King
Street
Station!
We'll
get
there
before
they
do!"
Bewildered,
Omar
watched
the
great
black
bird
lift
off.
It
banked
hard
to
the
south
across
Pennsylvania
Avenue,
and
then
thundered
off
into
the
night.
Underneath
the
cabbie's
feet,
a
subway
train
was
picking
up
speed
as
it
headed
away
from
Freedom
Plaza.
On
board,
Robert
Langdon
and
Katherine
Solomon
sat
breathless,
neither
one
saying
a
word
as
the
train
whisked
them
toward
their
destination.
The
memory
always
began
the
same
way.
He
was
falling
plummeting
backward
toward
an
ice-covered
river
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
ravine.
Above
him,
the
merciless
gray
eyes
of
Peter
Solomon
stared
down
over
the
barrel
of
Andros's
handgun.
As
he
fell,
the
world
above
him
receded,
everything
disappearing
as
he
was
enveloped
by
the
cloud
of
billowing
mist
from
the
waterfall
upstream.
For
an
instant,
everything
was
white,
like
heaven.
Then
he
hit
the
ice.
Cold.
Black.
Pain.
He
was
tumbling
being
dragged
by
a
powerful
force
that
pounded
him
relentlessly
across
rocks
in
an
impossibly
cold
void.
His
lungs
ached
for
air,
and
yet
his
chest
muscles
had
contracted
so
violently
in
the
cold
that
he
was
unable
even
to
inhale.
I'm
under
the
ice.
The
ice
near
the
waterfall
was
apparently
thin
on
account
of
the
turbulent
water,
and
Andros
had
broken
directly
through
it.
Now
he
was
being
washed
downstream,
trapped
beneath
a
transparent
ceiling.
He
clawed
at
the
underside
of
the
ice,
trying
to
break
out,
but
he
had
no
leverage.
The
searing
pain
from
the
bullet
hole
in
his
shoulder
was
evaporating,
as
was
the
sting
of
the
bird
shot;
both
were
blotted
out
now
by
the
crippling
throb
of
his
body
going
numb.
The
current
was
accelerating,
slingshotting
him
around
a
bend
in
the
river.
His
body
screamed
for
oxygen.
Suddenly
he
was
tangled
in
branches,
lodged
against
a
tree
that
had
fallen
into
the
water.
Think!
He
groped
wildly
at
the
branch,
working
his
way
toward
the
surface,
finding
the
spot
where
the
branch
pierced
up
through
the
ice.
His
fingertips
found
the
tiny
space
of
open
water
surrounding
the
branch,
and
he
pulled
at
the
edges,
trying
to
break
the
hole
wider;
once,
twice,
the
opening
was
growing,
now
several
inches
across.
Propping
himself
against
the
branch,
he
tipped
his
head
back
and
pressed
his
mouth
against
the
small
opening.
The
winter
air
that
poured
into
his
lungs
felt
warm.
The
sudden
burst
of
oxygen
fueled
his
hope.
He
planted
his
feet
on
the
tree
trunk
and
pressed
his
back
and
shoulders
forcefully
upward.
The
ice
around
the
fallen
tree,
perforated
by
branches
and
debris,
was
weakened
already,
and
as
he
drove
his
powerful
legs
into
the
trunk,
his
head
and
shoulders
broke
through
the
ice,
crashing
up
into
the
winter
night.
Air
poured
into
his
lungs.
Still
mostly
submerged,
he
wriggled
desperately
upward,
pushing
with
his
legs,
pulling
with
his
arms,
until
finally
he
was
out
of
the
water,
lying
breathless
on
the
bare
ice.
Andros
tore
off
his
soaked
ski
mask
and
pocketed
it,
glancing
back
upstream
for
Peter
Solomon.
The
bend
in
the
river
obscured
his
view.
His
chest
was
burning
again.
Quietly,
he
dragged
a
small
branch
over
the
hole
in
the
ice
in
order
to
hide
it.
The
hole
would
be
frozen
again
by
morning.
As
Andros
staggered
into
the
woods,
it
began
to
snow.
He
had
no
idea
how
far
he
had
run
when
he
stumbled
out
of
the
woods
onto
an
embankment
beside
a
small
highway.
He
was
delirious
and
hypothermic.
The
snow
was
falling
harder
now,
and
a
single
set
of
headlights
approached
in
the
distance.
Andros
waved
wildly,
and
the
lone
pickup
truck
immediately
pulled
over.
It
had
Vermont
plates.
An
old
man
in
a
red
plaid
shirt
jumped
out.
Andros
staggered
toward
him,
holding
his
bleeding
chest.
"A
hunter
shot
me!
I
need
a
hospital!"
Without
hesitation,
the
old
man
helped
Andros
up
into
the
passenger
seat
of
the
truck
and
turned
up
the
heater.
"Where's
the
nearest
hospital?!"
Andros
had
no
idea,
but
he
pointed
south.
"Next
exit."
We
're
not
going
to
a
hospital.
The
old
man
from
Vermont
was
reported
missing
the
next
day,
but
nobody
had
any
idea
where
on
his
journey
from
Vermont
he
might
have
disappeared
in
the
blinding
snowstorm.
Nor
did
anyone
link
his
disappearance
to
the
other
news
story
that
dominated
the
headlines
the
next
day
the
shocking
murder
of
Isabel
Solomon.
When
Andros
awoke,
he
was
lying
in
a
desolate
bedroom
of
a
cheap
motel
that
had
been
boarded
up
for
the
season.
He
recalled
breaking
in
and
binding
his
wounds
with
torn
bedsheets,
and
then
burrowing
into
a
flimsy
bed
beneath
a
pile
of
musty
blankets.
He
was
famished.
He
limped
to
the
bathroom
and
saw
the
pile
of
bloody
bird-shot
pellets
in
the
sink.
He
vaguely
recalled
prying
them
out
of
his
chest.
Raising
his
eyes
to
the
dirty
mirror,
he
reluctantly
unwrapped
his
bloody
bandages
to
survey
the
damage.
The
hard
muscles
of
his
chest
and
abdomen
had
stopped
the
bird
shot
from
penetrating
too
deep,
and
yet
his
body,
once
perfect,
was
now
ruined
with
wounds.
The
single
bullet
fired
by
Peter
Solomon
had
apparently
gone
cleanly
through
his
shoulder,
leaving
a
bloody
crater.
Making
matters
worse,
Andros
had
failed
to
obtain
that
for
which
he
had
traveled
all
this
distance.
The
pyramid.
His
stomach
growled,
and
he
limped
outside
to
the
man's
truck,
hoping
maybe
to
find
food.
The
pickup
was
now
covered
with
heavy
snow,
and
Andros
wondered
how
long
he
had
been
sleeping
in
this
old
motel.
Thank
God
I
woke
up.
Andros
found
no
food
anywhere
in
the
front
seat,
but
he
did
find
some
arthritis
painkillers
in
the
glove
compartment.
He
took
a
handful,
washing
them
down
with
several
mouthfuls
of
snow.
/
need
food.
A
few
hours
later,
the
pickup
that
pulled
out
from
behind
the
old
motel
looked
nothing
like
the
truck
that
had
pulled
in
two
days
earlier.
The
cab
cap
was
missing,
as
were
the
hubcaps,
bumper
stickers,
and
all
of
the
trim.
The
Vermont
plates
were
gone,
replaced
by
those
from
an
old
maintenance
truck
Andros
had
found
parked
by
the
motel
Dumpster,
into
which
he
had
thrown
all
the
bloody
sheets,
bird
shot,
and
other
evidence
that
he
had
ever
been
at
the
motel.
Andros
had
not
given
up
on
the
pyramid,
but
for
the
moment
it
would
have
to
wait.
He
needed
to
hide,
heal,
and
above
all,
eat.
He
found
a
roadside
diner
where
he
gorged
himself
on
eggs,
bacon,
hash
browns,
and
three
glasses
of
orange
juice.
When
he
was
done,
he
ordered
more
food
to
go.
Back
on
the
road,
Andros
listened
to
the
truck's
old
radio.
He
had
not
seen
a
television
or
newspaper
since
his
ordeal,
and
when
he
finally
heard
a
local
news
station,
the
report
stunned
him.
"FBI
investigators,"
a
news
announcer
said,
"continue
their
search
for
the
armed
intruder
who
murdered
Isabel
Solomon
in
her
Potomac
home
two
days
ago.
The
murderer
is
believed
to
have
fallen
through
the
ice
and
been
washed
out
to
sea."
Andros
froze.
Murdered
Isabel
Solomon?
He
drove
on
in
bewildered
silence,
listening
to
the
full
report.
It
was
time
to
get
far,
far
away
from
this
place.
The
Upper
West
Side
apartment
offered
breathtaking
views
of
Central
Park.
Andros
had
chosen
it
because
the
sea
of
green
outside
his
window
reminded
him
of
his
lost
view
of
the
Adriatic.
Although
he
knew
he
should
be
happy
to
be
alive,
he
was
not.
The
emptiness
had
never
left
him,
and
he
found
himself
fixated
on
his
failed
attempt
to
steal
Peter
Solomon's
pyramid.
Andros
had
spent
long
hours
researching
the
Legend
of
the
Masonic
Pyramid,
and
although
nobody
seemed
to
agree
on
whether
or
not
the
pyramid
was
real,
they
all
concurred
on
its
famous
promise
of
vast
wisdom
and
power.
The
Masonic
Pyramid
is
real,
Andros
told
himself.
My
inside
information
is
irrefutable.
Fate
had
placed
the
pyramid
within
Andros'
s
reach,
and
he
knew
that
ignoring
it
was
like
holding
a
winning
lottery
ticket
and
never
cashing
it
in.
/
am
the
only
non-Mason
alive
who
knows
the
pyramid
is
real
as
well
as
the
identity
of
the
man
who
guards
it.
Months
had
passed,
and
although
his
body
had
healed,
Andros
was
no
longer
the
cocky
specimen
he
had
been
in
Greece.
He
had
stopped
working
out,
and
he
had
stopped
admiring
himself
naked
in
the
mirror.
He
felt
as
if
his
body
were
beginning
to
show
signs
of
age.
His
once-perfect
skin
was
a
patchwork
of
scars,
and
this
only
depressed
him
further.
He
still
relied
on
the
painkillers
that
had
nursed
him
through
his
recovery,
and
he
felt
himself
slipping
back
to
the
lifestyle
that
had
put
him
in
Soganlik
Prison.
He
didn't
care.
The
body
craves
what
the
body
craves.
One
night,
he
was
in
Greenwich
Village
buying
drugs
from
a
man
whose
forearm
had
been
tattooed
with
a
long,
jagged
lightning
bolt.
Andros
asked
him
about
it,
and
the
man
told
him
the
tattoo
was
covering
a
long
scar
he
had
gotten
in
a
car
accident.
"Seeing
the
scar
every
day
reminded
me
of
the
accident,"
the
dealer
said,
"and
so
I
tattooed
over
it
with
a
symbol
of
personal
power.
I
took
back
control."
That
night,
high
on
his
new
stash
of
drugs,
Andros
staggered
into
a
local
tattoo
parlor
and
took
off
his
shirt.
"I
want
to
hide
these
scars,"
he
announced.
/
want
to
take
back
control.
"Hide
them?"
The
tattoo
artist
eyed
his
chest.
"With
whatT
"Tattoos."
"Yes
I
mean
tattoos
of
whatV
Andros
shrugged,
wanting
nothing
more
than
to
hide
the
ugly
reminders
of
his
past.
"I
don't
know.
You
choose."
The
artist
shook
his
head
and
handed
Andros
a
pamphlet
on
the
ancient
and
sacred
tradition
of
tattooing.
"Come
back
when
you're
ready."
Andros
discovered
that
the
New
York
Public
Library
had
in
its
collection
fifty-three
books
on
tattooing,
and
within
a
few
weeks,
he
had
read
them
all.
Having
rediscovered
his
passion
for
reading,
he
began
carrying
entire
backpacks
of
books
back
and
forth
between
the
library
and
his
apartment,
where
he
voraciously
devoured
them
while
overlooking
Central
Park.
These
books
on
tattoos
had
opened
a
door
to
a
strange
world
Andros
had
never
known
existed
a
world
of
symbols,
mysticism,
mythology,
and
the
magical
arts.
The
more
he
read,
the
more
he
realized
how
blind
he
had
been.
He
began
keeping
notebooks
of
his
ideas,
his
sketches,
and
his
strange
dreams.
When
he
could
no
longer
find
what
he
wanted
at
the
library,
he
paid
rare-book
dealers
to
purchase
for
him
some
of
the
most
esoteric
texts
on
earth.
De
Praestigiis
Daemonum
Lemegeton
Ars
Almadel
Grimorium
Verum
Ars
Notoria
and
on
and
on.
He
read
them
all,
becoming
more
and
more
certain
that
the
world
still
had
many
treasures
yet
to
offer
him.
There
are
secrets
out
there
that
transcend
human
understanding.
Then
he
discovered
the
writings
of
Aleister
Crowley
a
visionary
mystic
from
the
early
1900s
whom
the
church
had
deemed
"the
most
evil
man
who
ever
lived."
Great
minds
are
always
feared
by
lesser
minds.
Andros
learned
about
the
power
of
ritual
and
incantation.
He
learned
that
sacred
words,
if
properly
spoken,
functioned
like
keys
that
opened
gateways
to
other
worlds.
There
is
a
shadow
universe
beyond
this
one
a
world
from
which
I
can
draw
power.
And
although
Andros
longed
to
harness
that
power,
he
knew
there
were
rules
and
tasks
to
be
completed
beforehand.
Become
something
holy,
Crowley
wrote.
Make
yourself
sacred.
The
ancient
rite
of
"sacred
making"
had
once
been
the
law
of
the
land.
From
the
early
Hebrews
who
made
burnt
offerings
at
the
Temple,
to
the
Mayans
who
beheaded
humans
atop
the
pyramids
of
Chichen
Itza,
to
Jesus
Christ,
who
offered
his
body
on
the
cross,
the
ancients
understood
God's
requirement
for
sacrifice.
Sacrifice
was
the
original
ritual
by
which
humans
drew
favor
from
the
gods
and
made
themselves
holy.
Sacra
sacred.
Face
make.
Even
though
the
rite
of
sacrifice
had
been
abandoned
eons
ago,
its
power
remained.
There
had
been
a
handful
of
modern
mystics,
including
Aleister
Crowley,
who
practiced
the
Art,
perfecting
it
over
time,
and
transforming
themselves
gradually
into
something
more.
Andros
craved
to
transform
himself
as
they
had.
And
yet
he
knew
he
would
have
to
cross
a
dangerous
bridge
to
do
so.
Blood
is
all
that
separates
the
light
from
the
dark.
One
night,
a
crow
flew
through
Andros'
s
open
bathroom
window
and
got
trapped
in
his
apartment.
Andros
watched
the
bird
flutter
around
for
a
while
and
then
finally
stop,
apparently
accepting
its
inability
to
escape.
Andros
had
learned
enough
to
recognize
a
sign.
/
am
being
urged
onward.
Clutching
the
bird
in
one
hand,
he
stood
at
the
makeshift
altar
in
his
kitchen
and
raised
a
sharp
knife,
speaking
aloud
the
incantation
he
had
memorized.
"Camiach,
Eomiahe,
Emial,
Macbal,
Emoii,
Zazean
by
the
most
holy
names
of
the
angels
in
the
Book
of
Assamaian,
I
conjure
thee
that
thou
assist
me
in
this
operation
by
the
power
of
the
One
True
God.
Andros
now
lowered
the
knife
and
carefully
pierced
the
large
vein
on
the
right
wing
of
the
panicked
bird.
The
crow
began
to
bleed.
As
he
watched
the
stream
of
red
liquid
flowing
down
into
the
metal
cup
he
had
placed
as
a
receptacle,
he
felt
an
unexpected
chill
in
the
air.
Nonetheless,
he
continued.
"Almighty
Adonai,
Arathron,
Ashai,
Elohim,
Elohi,
Elion,
Asher
Eheieh,
Shaddai
be
my
aid,
so
that
this
blood
may
have
power
and
efficacy
in
all
wherein
I
shall
wish,
and
in
all
that
I
shall
demand.
That
night,
he
dreamed
of
birds
of
a
giant
phoenix
rising
from
a
billowing
fire.
The
next
morning,
he
awoke
with
an
energy
he
had
not
felt
since
childhood.
He
went
running
in
the
park,
faster
and
farther
than
he'd
imagined
possible.
When
he
could
run
no
longer,
he
stopped
to
do
pushups
and
sit-ups.
Countless
repetitions.
Still
he
had
energy.
That
night,
again,
he
dreamed
of
the
phoenix.
Autumn
had
fallen
again
on
Central
Park,
and
the
wildlife
were
scurrying
about
searching
for
food
for
winter.
Andros
despised
the
cold,
and
yet
his
carefully
hidden
traps
were
now
overflowing
with
live
rats
and
squirrels.
He
took
them
home
in
his
backpack,
performing
rituals
of
increasing
complexity.
Emanual,
Massiach,
Yod,
He,
Vaud
please
find
me
worthy.
The
blood
rituals
fueled
his
vitality.
Andros
felt
younger
every
day.
He
continued
to
read
day
and
night
ancient
mystical
texts,
epic
medieval
poems,
the
early
philosophers
and
the
more
he
learned
about
the
true
nature
of
things,
the
more
he
realized
that
all
hope
for
mankind
was
lost.
They
are
blind
wandering
aimlessly
in
a
world
they
will
never
understand.
Andros
was
still
a
man,
but
he
sensed
he
was
evolving
into
something
else.
Something
greater.
Something
sacred.
His
massive
physique
had
emerged
from
dormancy,
more
powerful
now
than
ever
before.
He
finally
understood
its
true
purpose.
My
body
is
but
a
vessel
for
my
most
potent
treasure
my
mind.
Andros
knew
his
true
potential
had
not
yet
been
realized,
and
he
delved
deeper.
What
is
my
destiny?
All
the
ancient
texts
spoke
of
good
and
evil
and
of
man's
need
to
choose
between
them.
/
made
my
choice
long
ago,
he
knew,
and
yet
he
felt
no
remorse.
What
is
evil,
if
not
a
natural
law?
Darkness
followed
light.
Chaos
followed
order.
Entropy
was
fundamental.
Everything
decayed.
The
perfectly
ordered
crystal
eventually
turned
into
random
particles
of
dust.
There
are
those
who
create
and
those
who
destroy.
It
was
not
until
Andros
read
John
Milton's
Paradise
Lost
that
he
saw
his
destiny
materialize
before
him.
He
read
of
the
great
fallen
angel
the
warrior
demon
who
fought
against
the
light
the
valiant
one
the
angel
called
Moloch.
Moloch
walked
the
earth
as
a
god.
The
angel's
name,
Andros
later
learned,
when
translated
to
the
ancient
tongue,
became
Mal'akh.
And
so
shall
I.
Like
all
great
transformations,
this
one
had
to
begin
with
a
sacrifice
but
not
of
rats,
nor
birds.
No,
this
transformation
required
a
true
sacrifice.
There
is
but
one
worthy
sacrifice.
Suddenly
he
had
a
sense
of
clarity
unlike
anything
he
had
ever
experienced
in
his
life.
His
entire
destiny
had
materialized.
For
three
straight
days
he
sketched
on
an
enormous
sheet
of
paper.
When
he
was
done,
he
had
created
a
blueprint
of
what
he
would
become.
He
hung
the
life-size
sketch
on
his
wall
and
gazed
into
it
as
if
into
a
mirror.
/
am
a
masterpiece.
The
next
day,
he
took
his
drawing
to
the
tattoo
parlor.
He
was
ready.
The
George
Washington
Masonic
Memorial
stands
atop
Shuter's
Hill
in
Alexandria,
Virginia.
Built
in
three
distinct
tiers
of
increasing
architectural
complexity
from
bottom
to
top
Doric,
Ionic,
and
Corinthian
the
structure
stands
as
a
physical
symbol
of
man's
intellectual
ascent.
Inspired
by
the
ancient
Pharos
lighthouse
of
Alexandria,
Egypt,
this
soaring
tower
is
capped
by
an
Egyptian
pyramid
with
a
flamelike
finial.
Inside
the
spectacular
marble
foyer
sits
a
massive
bronze
of
George
Washington
in
full
Masonic
regalia,
along
with
the
actual
trowel
he
used
to
lay
the
cornerstone
of
the
Capitol
Building.
Above
the
foyer,
nine
different
levels
bear
names
like
the
Grotto,
the
Crypt
Room,
and
the
Knights
Templar
Chapel.
Among
the
treasures
housed
within
these
spaces
are
over
twenty
thousand
volumes
of
Masonic
writings,
a
dazzling
replica
of
the
Ark
of
the
Covenant,
and
even
a
scale
model
of
the
throne
room
in
King
Solomon's
Temple.
CIA
agent
Simkins
checked
his
watch
as
the
modified
UH-60
chopper
skimmed
in
low
over
the
Potomac.
Six
minutes
until
their
train
arrives.
He
exhaled
and
gazed
out
the
window
at
the
shining
Masonic
Memorial
on
the
horizon.
He
had
to
admit,
the
brilliantly
shining
tower
was
as
impressive
as
any
building
on
the
National
Mall.
Simkins
had
never
been
inside
the
memorial,
and
tonight
would
be
no
different.
If
all
went
according
to
plan,
Robert
Langdon
and
Katherine
Solomon
would
never
make
it
out
of
the
subway
station.
"Over
there!"
Simkins
shouted
to
the
pilot,
pointing
down
at
the
King
Street
subway
station
across
from
the
memorial.
The
pilot
banked
the
helicopter
and
set
it
down
on
a
grassy
area
at
the
foot
of
Shuter's
Hill.
Pedestrians
looked
up
in
surprise
as
Simkins
and
his
team
piled
out,
dashed
across
the
street,
and
ran
down
into
King
Street
Station.
In
the
stairwell,
several
departing
passengers
leaped
out
of
the
way,
plastering
themselves
to
the
walls
as
the
phalanx
of
armed
men
in
black
thundered
past
them.
The
King
Street
Station
was
larger
than
Simkins
had
anticipated,
apparently
serving
several
different
lines
Blue,
Yellow,
and
Amtrak.
He
raced
over
to
the
Metro
map
on
the
wall,
found
Freedom
Plaza
and
the
direct
line
to
this
location.
"Blue
Line,
southbound
platform!"
Simkins
shouted.
"Get
down
there
and
clear
everyone
out!"
His
team
dashed
off.
Simkins
rushed
over
to
the
ticket
booth,
flashed
his
identification,
and
shouted
to
the
woman
inside.
"The
next
train
from
Metro
Center
what
time
is
it
due?!"
The
woman
inside
looked
frightened.
"I'm
not
sure.
Blue
Line
arrives
every
eleven
minutes.
There's
no
set
schedule."
"How
long
since
the
last
train?"
"Five
six
minutes,
maybe?
No
more
than
that."
Turner
did
the
math.
Perfect.
The
next
train
had
to
be
Langdon's.
Inside
a
fast-moving
subway
car,
Katherine
Solomon
shifted
uncomfortably
on
the
hard
plastic
seat.
The
bright
fluorescent
lights
overhead
hurt
her
eyes,
and
she
fought
the
impulse
to
let
her
eyelids
close,
even
for
a
second.
Langdon
sat
beside
her
in
the
empty
car,
staring
blankly
down
at
the
leather
bag
at
his
feet.
His
eyelids
looked
heavy,
too,
as
if
the
rhythmic
sway
of
the
moving
car
were
lulling
him
into
a
trance.
Katherine
pictured
the
strange
contents
of
Langdon's
bag.
Why
does
the
CIA
want
this
pyramid?
Bellamy
had
said
that
Sato
might
be
pursuing
the
pyramid
because
she
knew
its
true
potential.
But
even
if
this
pyramid
somehow
did
reveal
the
hiding
place
of
ancient
secrets,
Katherine
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
its
promise
of
primeval
mystical
wisdom
would
interest
the
CIA.
Then
again,
she
reminded
herself,
the
CIA
had
been
caught
several
times
running
parapsychological
or
psi
programs
that
bordered
on
ancient
magic
and
mysticism.
In
1995,
the
"Stargate/Scannate"
scandal
had
exposed
a
classified
CIA
technology
called
remote
viewing
a
kind
of
telepathic
mind
travel
that
enabled
a
"viewer"
to
transport
his
mind's
eye
to
any
location
on
earth
and
spy
there,
without
being
physically
present.
Of
course,
the
technology
was
nothing
new.
Mystics
called
it
astral
projection,
and
yogis
called
it
out-of-
body
experience.
Unfortunately,
horrified
American
taxpayers
called
it
absurd,
and
the
program
had
been
scuttled.
At
least
publicly.
Ironically,
Katherine
saw
remarkable
connections
between
the
CIA's
failed
programs
and
her
own
breakthroughs
in
Noetic
Science.
Katherine
felt
eager
to
call
the
police
and
find
out
if
they
had
discovered
anything
in
Kalorama
Heights,
but
she
and
Langdon
were
phoneless
now,
and
making
contact
with
the
authorities
would
probably
be
a
mistake
anyway;
there
was
no
telling
how
far
Sato's
reach
extended.
Patience,
Katherine.
Within
minutes,
they
would
be
in
a
safe
hiding
place,
guests
of
a
man
who
had
assured
them
he
could
provide
answers.
Katherine
hoped
his
answers,
whatever
they
might
be,
would
help
her
save
her
brother.
"Robert?"
she
whispered,
glancing
up
at
the
subway
map.
"Next
stop
is
ours."
Langdon
emerged
slowly
from
his
daydream.
"Right,
thanks."
As
the
train
rumbled
toward
the
station,
he
collected
his
daybag
and
gave
Katherine
an
uncertain
glance.
"Let's
just
hope
our
arrival
is
uneventful."
By
the
time
Turner
Simkins
dashed
down
to
join
his
men,
the
subway
platform
had
been
entirely
cleared,
and
his
team
was
fanning
out,
taking
up
positions
behind
the
support
pillars
that
ran
the
length
of
the
platform.
A
distant
rumble
echoed
in
the
tunnel
at
the
other
end
of
the
platform,
and
as
it
grew
louder,
Simkins
felt
the
push
of
stale
warm
air
billowing
around
him.
No
escape,
Mr.
Langdon.
Simkins
turned
to
the
two
agents
he
had
told
to
join
him
on
the
platform.
"Identification
and
weapons
out.
These
trains
are
automated,
but
they
all
have
a
conductor
who
opens
the
doors.
Find
him."
The
train's
headlamp
now
appeared
down
the
tunnel,
and
the
sound
of
squealing
brakes
pierced
the
air.
As
the
train
burst
into
the
station
and
began
slowing
down,
Simkins
and
his
two
agents
leaned
out
over
the
track,
waving
CIA
identification
badges
and
straining
to
make
eye
contact
with
the
conductor
before
he
could
open
the
doors.
The
train
was
closing
fast.
In
the
third
car,
Simkins
finally
saw
the
startled
face
of
the
conductor,
who
was
apparently
trying
to
figure
out
why
three
men
in
black
were
all
waving
identification
badges
at
him.
Simkins
jogged
toward
the
train,
which
was
now
nearing
a
full
stop.
"CIA!"
Simkins
shouted,
holding
up
his
ID.
"Do
NOT
open
the
doors!"
As
the
train
glided
slowly
past
him,
he
went
toward
the
conductor's
car,
shouting
in
at
him.
"Do
not
open
your
doors!
Do
you
understand?!
Do
NOT
open
your
doors!"
The
train
came
to
a
full
stop,
its
wide-eyed
conductor
nodding
repeatedly.
"What's
wrong?!"
the
man
demanded
through
his
side
window.
"Don't
let
this
train
move,"
Simkins
said.
"And
don't
open
the
doors."
"Okay."
"Can
you
let
us
into
the
first
car?"
The
conductor
nodded.
Looking
fearful,
he
stepped
out
of
the
train,
closing
the
door
behind
him.
He
escorted
Simkins
and
his
men
to
the
first
car,
where
he
manually
opened
the
door.
"Lock
it
behind
us,"
Simkins
said,
pulling
his
weapon.
Simkins
and
his
men
stepped
quickly
into
the
stark
light
of
the
first
car.
The
conductor
locked
the
door
behind
them.
The
first
car
contained
only
four
passengers
three
teenage
boys
and
an
old
woman
all
of
whom
looked
understandably
startled
to
see
three
armed
men
entering.
Simkins
held
up
his
ID.
"Everything's
fine.
Just
stay
seated."
Simkins
and
his
men
now
began
their
sweep,
pushing
toward
the
back
of
the
sealed
train
one
car
at
a
time
"squeezing
toothpaste,"
as
it
was
called
during
his
training
at
the
Farm.
Very
few
passengers
were
on
this
train,
and
halfway
to
the
back,
the
agents
still
had
seen
nobody
even
remotely
resembling
the
description
of
Robert
Langdon
and
Katherine
Solomon.
Nonetheless,
Simkins
remained
confident.
There
was
absolutely
no
place
to
hide
on
a
subway
car.
No
bathrooms,
no
storage,
and
no
alternative
exits.
Even
if
the
targets
had
seen
them
board
the
train
and
fled
to
the
back,
there
was
no
way
out.
Prying
open
a
door
was
almost
impossible,
and
Simkins
had
men
watching
the
platform
and
both
sides
of
the
train
anyway.
Patience.
By
the
time
Simkins
reached
the
second-to-last
car,
however,
he
was
feeling
edgy.
This
penultimate
car
had
only
one
passenger
a
Chinese
man.
Simkins
and
his
agents
moved
through,
scanning
for
any
place
to
hide.
There
was
none.
"Last
car,"
Simkins
said,
raising
his
weapon
as
the
threesome
moved
toward
the
threshold
of
the
train's
final
section.
As
they
stepped
into
the
last
car,
all
three
of
them
immediately
stopped
and
stared.
What
the
?!
Simkins
raced
to
the
rear
of
the
deserted
cabin,
searching
behind
all
the
seats.
He
spun
back
to
his
men,
blood
boiling.
"Where
the
hell
did
they
go?!"
Eight
miles
due
north
of
Alexandria,
Virginia,
Robert
Langdon
and
Katherine
Solomon
strode
calmly
across
a
wide
expanse
of
frost-covered
lawn.
"You
should
be
an
actress,"
Langdon
said,
still
impressed
by
Katherine'
s
quick
thinking
and
improvisational
skills.
"You
weren't
half
bad
yourself."
She
gave
him
a
smile.
At
first,
Langdon
had
been
mystified
by
Katherine's
abrupt
antics
in
the
taxi.
Without
warning,
she
had
suddenly
demanded
they
go
to
Freedom
Plaza
based
on
some
revelation
about
a
Jewish
star
and
the
Great
Seal
of
the
United
States.
She
drew
a
well-known
conspiracy-theory
image
on
a
dollar
bill
and
then
insisted
Langdon
look
closely
where
she
was
pointing.
Finally,
Langdon
realized
that
Katherine
was
pointing
not
at
the
dollar
bill
but
at
a
tiny
indicator
bulb
on
the
back
of
the
driver's
seat.
The
bulb
was
so
covered
with
grime
that
he
had
not
even
noticed
it.
As
he
leaned
forward,
however,
he
could
see
that
the
bulb
was
illuminated,
emitting
a
dull
red
glow.
He
could
also
see
the
two
faint
words
directly
beneath
the
lit
bulb.
INTERCOM
ON
Startled,
Langdon
glanced
back
at
Katherine,
whose
frantic
eyes
were
urging
him
to
look
into
the
front
seat.
He
obeyed,
stealing
a
discreet
glance
through
the
divider.
The
cabby's
cell
phone
was
on
the
dash,
wide
open,
illuminated,
facing
the
intercom
speaker.
An
instant
later,
Langdon
understood
Katherine's
actions.
They
know
we
're
in
this
cab
they
've
been
listening
to
us.
Langdon
had
no
idea
how
much
time
he
and
Katherine
had
until
their
taxi
was
stopped
and
surrounded,
but
he
knew
they
had
to
act
fast.
Instantly,
he'd
begun
playing
along,
realizing
that
Katherine's
desire
to
go
to
Freedom
Plaza
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
pyramid
but
rather
with
its
being
a
large
subway
station
Metro
Center
from
which
they
could
take
the
Red,
Blue,
or
Orange
lines
in
any
of
six
different
directions.
They
jumped
out
of
the
taxi
at
Freedom
Plaza,
and
Langdon
took
over,
doing
some
improvising
of
his
own,
leaving
a
trail
to
the
Masonic
Memorial
in
Alexandria
before
he
and
Katherine
ran
down
into
the
subway
station,
dashing
past
the
Blue
Line
platforms
and
continuing
on
to
the
Red
Line,
where
they
caught
a
train
in
the
opposite
direction.
Traveling
six
stops
northbound
to
Tenleytown,
they
emerged
all
alone
into
a
quiet,
upscale
neighborhood.
Their
destination,
the
tallest
structure
for
miles,
was
immediately
visible
on
the
horizon,
just
off
Massachusetts
Avenue
on
a
vast
expanse
of
manicured
lawn.
Now
"off
the
grid,"
as
Katherine
called
it,
the
two
of
them
walked
across
the
damp
grass.
On
their
right
was
a
medieval-
style
garden,
famous
for
its
ancient
rosebushes
and
Shadow
House
gazebo.
They
moved
past
the
garden,
directly
toward
the
magnificent
building
to
which
they
had
been
summoned.
A
refuge
containing
ten
stones
from
Mount
Sinai,
one
from
heaven
itself
and
one
with
the
visage
of
Luke's
dark
father.
"I've
never
been
here
at
night,"
Katherine
said,
gazing
up
at
the
brightly
lit
towers.
"It's
spectacular."
Langdon
agreed,
having
forgotten
how
impressive
this
place
truly
was.
This
neo-Gothic
masterpiece
stood
at
the
north
end
of
Embassy
Row.
He
hadn't
been
here
for
years,
not
since
writing
a
piece
about
it
for
a
kids'
magazine
in
hopes
of
generating
some
excitement
among
young
Americans
to
come
see
this
amazing
landmark.
His
article
"Moses,
Moon
Rocks,
and
Star
Wars"
had
been
part
of
the
tourist
literature
for
years.
Washington
National
Cathedral,
Langdon
thought,
feeling
an
unexpected
anticipation
at
being
back
after
all
these
years.
Where
better
to
ask
about
One
True
God?
"This
cathedral
really
has
ten
stones
from
Mount
Sinai?"
Katherine
asked,
gazing
up
at
the
twin
bell
towers.
Langdon
nodded.
"Near
the
main
altar.
They
symbolize
the
Ten
Commandments
given
to
Moses
on
Mount
Sinai."
"And
there's
a
lunar
rock?"
A
rock
from
heaven
itself.
"Yes.
One
of
the
stained-glass
windows
is
called
the
Space
Window
and
has
a
fragment
of
moon
rock
embedded
in
it."
"Okay,
but
you
can't
be
serious
about
the
last
thing."
Katherine
glanced
over,
her
pretty
eyes
flashing
skepticism.
"A
statue
of
Darth
Vader?"
Langdon
chuckled.
"Luke
Sky
walker's
dark
father?
Absolutely.
Vader
is
one
of
the
National
Cathedral's
most
popular
grotesques."
He
pointed
high
into
the
west
towers.
"Tough
to
see
him
at
night,
but
he's
there."
"What
in
the
world
is
Darth
Vader
doing
on
Washington
National
Cathedral?"
"A
contest
for
kids
to
carve
a
gargoyle
that
depicted
the
face
of
evil.
Darth
won."
They
reached
the
grand
staircase
to
the
main
entrance,
which
was
set
back
in
an
eighty-foot
archway
beneath
a
breathtaking
rose
window.
As
they
began
climbing,
Langdon'
s
mind
shifted
to
the
mysterious
stranger
who
had
called
him.
No
names,
please
Tell
me,
have
you
successfully
protected
the
map
that
was
entrusted
to
you?
Langdon'
s
shoulder
ached
from
carrying
the
heavy
stone
pyramid,
and
he
was
looking
forward
to
setting
it
down.
Sanctuary
and
answers.
As
they
approached
the
top
of
the
stairs,
they
were
met
with
an
imposing
pair
of
wooden
doors.
"Do
we
just
knock?"
Katherine
asked.
Langdon
had
been
wondering
the
same
thing,
except
that
now
one
of
the
doors
was
creaking
open.
"Who's
there?"
a
frail
voice
said.
The
face
of
a
withered
old
man
appeared
in
the
doorway.
He
wore
priest's
robes
and
a
blank
stare.
His
eyes
were
opaque
and
white,
clouded
with
cataracts.
"My
name
is
Robert
Langdon,"
he
replied.
"Katherine
Solomon
and
I
are
seeking
sanctuary."
The
blind
man
exhaled
in
relief.
"Thank
God.
I've
been
expecting
you."
Warren
Bellamy
felt
a
sudden
ray
of
hope.
Inside
the
Jungle,
Director
Sato
had
just
received
a
phone
call
from
a
field
agent
and
had
immediately
flown
into
a
tirade.
"Well,
you
damn
well
better
find
them!"
she
shouted
into
her
phone.
"We're
running
out
of
time!"
She
had
hung
up
and
was
now
stalking
back
and
forth
in
front
of
Bellamy
as
if
trying
to
decide
what
to
do
next.
Finally,
she
stopped
directly
in
front
of
him
and
turned.
"Mr.
Bellamy,
I'm
going
to
ask
you
this
once,
and
only
once."
She
stared
deep
into
his
eyes.
"Yes
or
no
do
you
have
any
idea
where
Robert
Langdon
might
have
gone?"
Bellamy
had
more
than
a
good
idea,
but
he
shook
his
head.
"No."
Sato's
piercing
gaze
had
never
left
his
eyes.
"Unfortunately,
part
of
my
job
is
to
know
when
people
are
lying."
Bellamy
averted
his
eyes.
"Sorry,
I
can't
help
you."
"Architect
Bellamy,"
Sato
said,
"tonight
just
after
seven
P.M.,
you
were
having
dinner
in
a
restaurant
outside
the
city
when
you
received
a
phone
call
from
a
man
who
told
you
he
had
kidnapped
Peter
Solomon."
Bellamy
felt
an
instant
chill
and
returned
his
eyes
to
hers.
How
could
you
possibly
know
that?!
"The
man,"
Sato
continued,
"told
you
that
he
had
sent
Robert
Langdon
to
the
Capitol
Building
and
given
Langdon
a
task
to
complete
a
task
that
required
your
help.
He
warned
that
if
Langdon
failed
in
this
task,
your
friend
Peter
Solomon
would
die.
Panicked,
you
called
all
of
Peter's
numbers
but
failed
to
reach
him.
Understandably,
you
then
raced
to
the
Capitol."
Bellamy
could
not
imagine
how
Sato
knew
about
this
phone
call.
"As
you
fled
the
Capitol,"
Sato
said
behind
the
smoldering
tip
of
her
cigarette,
"you
sent
a
text
message
to
Solomon's
kidnapper,
assuring
him
that
you
and
Langdon
had
been
successful
in
obtaining
the
Masonic
Pyramid."
Where
is
she
getting
her
information
?
Bellamy
wondered.
Not
even
Langdon
knows
I
sent
that
text
message.
Immediately
after
entering
the
tunnel
to
the
Library
of
Congress,
Bellamy
had
stepped
into
the
electrical
room
to
plug
in
the
construction
lighting.
In
the
privacy
of
that
moment,
he
had
decided
to
send
a
quick
text
message
to
Solomon's
captor,
telling
him
about
Sato's
involvement,
but
reassuring
him
that
he
Bellamy
and
Langdon
had
obtained
the
Masonic
Pyramid
and
would
indeed
cooperate
with
his
demands.
It
was
a
lie,
of
course,
but
Bellamy
hoped
the
reassurance
might
buy
time,
both
for
Peter
Solomon
and
also
to
hide
the
pyramid.
"Who
told
you
I
sent
a
text?"
Bellamy
demanded.
Sato
tossed
Bellamy's
cell
phone
on
the
bench
next
to
him.
"Hardly
rocket
science."
Bellamy
now
remembered
his
phone
and
keys
had
been
taken
from
him
by
the
agents
who
captured
him.
"As
for
the
rest
of
my
inside
information,"
Sato
said,
"the
Patriot
Act
gives
me
the
right
to
place
a
wiretap
on
the
phone
of
anyone
I
consider
a
viable
threat
to
national
security.
I
consider
Peter
Solomon
to
be
such
a
threat,
and
last
night
I
took
action."
Bellamy
could
barely
get
his
mind
around
what
she
was
telling
him.
"You're
tapping
Peter
Solomon's
phone?"
"Yes.
This
is
how
I
knew
the
kidnapper
called
you
at
the
restaurant.
You
called
Peter's
cell
phone
and
left
an
anxious
message
explaining
what
had
just
happened."
Bellamy
realized
she
was
right.
"We
had
also
intercepted
a
call
from
Robert
Langdon,
who
was
in
the
Capitol
Building,
deeply
confused
to
learn
he
had
been
tricked
into
coming
there.
I
went
to
the
Capitol
at
once,
arriving
before
you
because
I
was
closer.
As
for
how
I
knew
to
check
the
X-ray
of
Langdon'
s
bag
in
light
of
my
realization
that
Langdon
was
involved
in
all
of
this,
I
had
my
staff
reexamine
a
seemingly
innocuous
early-morning
call
between
Langdon
and
Peter
Solomon's
cell
phone,
in
which
the
kidnapper,
posing
as
Solomon's
assistant,
persuaded
Langdon
to
come
for
a
lecture
and
also
to
bring
a
small
package
that
Peter
had
entrusted
to
him.
When
Langdon
was
not
forthcoming
with
me
about
the
package
he
was
carrying,
I
requested
the
X-ray
of
his
bag."
Bellamy
could
barely
think.
Admittedly,
everything
Sato
was
saying
was
feasible,
and
yet
something
was
not
adding
up.
"But
how
could
you
possibly
think
Peter
Solomon
is
a
threat
to
national
security?"
"Believe
me,
Peter
Solomon
is
a
serious
national-
security
threat,"
she
snapped.
"And
frankly,
Mr.
Bellamy,
so
are
you."
Bellamy
sat
bolt
upright,
the
handcuffs
chafing
against
his
wrists.
"I
beg
your
pardon?!"
She
forced
a
smile.
"You
Masons
play
a
risky
game.
You
keep
a
very,
very
dangerous
secret."
Is
she
talking
about
the
Ancient
Mysteries
?
"Thankfully,
you've
always
done
a
good
job
of
keeping
your
secrets
hidden.
Unfortunately,
recently
you've
been
careless,
and
tonight,
your
most
dangerous
secret
is
about
to
be
unveiled
to
the
world.
And
unless
we
can
stop
that
from
happening,
I
assure
you
the
results
will
be
catastrophic."
Bellamy
stared
in
bewilderment.
"If
you
had
not
attacked
me,"
Sato
said,
"you
would
have
realized
that
you
and
I
are
on
the
same
team."
The
same
team.
The
words
sparked
in
Bellamy
an
idea
that
seemed
almost
impossible
to
fathom.
Is
Sato
a
member
of
Eastern
Star?
The
Order
of
the
Eastern
Star
often
considered
a
sister
organization
to
the
Masons
embraced
a
similar
mystical
philosophy
of
benevolence,
secret
wisdom,
and
spiritual
open-
mindedness.
The
same
team?
I'm
in
handcuffs!
She's
tapping
Peter's
phone!
"You
will
help
me
stop
this
man,"
Sato
said.
"He
has
the
potential
to
bring
about
a
cataclysm
from
which
this
country
might
not
recover."
Her
face
was
like
stone.
"Then
why
aren't
you
tracking
him?"
Sato
looked
incredulous.
"Do
you
think
I'm
not
trying!
My
trace
on
Solomon's
cell
phone
went
dead
before
we
got
a
location.
His
other
number
appears
to
be
a
disposable
phone
which
is
almost
impossible
to
track.
The
private-jet
company
told
us
that
Langdon's
flight
was
booked
by
Solomon's
assistant,
on
Solomon's
cell
phone,
with
Solomon's
Marquis
Jet
card.
There
is
no
trail.
Not
that
it
matters
anyway.
Even
if
we
find
out
exactly
where
he
is,
I
can't
possibly
risk
moving
in
and
trying
to
grab
him."
"Why
not?!"
"I'd
prefer
not
to
share
that,
as
the
information
is
classified,"
Sato
said,
patience
clearly
waning.
"I
am
asking
you
to
trust
me
on
this."
"Well,
I
don't!"
Sato's
eyes
were
like
ice.
She
turned
suddenly
and
shouted
across
the
Jungle.
"Agent
Hartmann!
The
briefcase,
please."
Bellamy
heard
the
hiss
of
the
electronic
door,
and
an
agent
strode
into
the
Jungle.
He
was
carrying
a
sleek
titanium
briefcase,
which
he
set
on
the
ground
beside
the
OS
director.
"Leave
us,"
Sato
said.
As
the
agent
departed,
the
door
hissed
again,
and
then
everything
fell
silent.
Sato
picked
up
the
metal
case,
laid
it
across
her
lap,
and
popped
the
clasps.
Then
she
raised
her
eyes
slowly
to
Bellamy.
"I
did
not
want
to
do
this,
but
our
time
is
running
out,
and
you've
left
me
no
choice."
Bellamy
eyed
the
strange
briefcase
and
felt
a
swell
of
fear.
Is
she
going
to
torture
me?
He
strained
at
his
cuffs
again.
"What's
in
that
case?!"
Sato
smiled
grimly.
"Something
that
will
persuade
you
to
see
things
my
way.
I
guarantee
it."
The
subterranean
space
in
which
Mal'akh
performed
the
Art
was
ingeniously
hidden.
His
home's
basement,
to
those
who
entered,
appeared
quite
normal
a
typical
cellar
with
boiler,
fuse
box,
woodpile,
and
a
hodgepodge
of
storage.
This
visible
cellar,
however,
was
only
a
portion
of
Mal'akh's
underground
space.
A
sizable
area
had
been
walled
off
for
his
clandestine
practices.
Mal'akh's
private
work
space
was
a
suite
of
small
rooms,
each
with
a
specialized
purpose.
The
area's
sole
entrance
was
a
steep
ramp
secretly
accessible
through
his
living
room,
making
the
area's
discovery
virtually
impossible.
Tonight,
as
Mal'akh
descended
the
ramp,
the
tattooed
sigils
and
signs
on
his
flesh
seemed
to
come
alive
in
the
cerulean
glow
of
his
basement's
specialized
lighting.
Moving
into
the
bluish
haze,
he
walked
past
several
closed
doors
and
headed
directly
for
the
largest
room
at
the
end
of
the
corridor.
The
"sanctum
sanctorum,"
as
Mal'akh
liked
to
call
it,
was
a
perfect
twelve-foot
square.
Twelve
are
the
signs
of
the
zodiac.
Twelve
are
the
hours
of
the
day.
Twelve
are
the
gates
of
heaven.
In
the
center
of
the
chamber
was
a
stone
table,
a
seven-by-seven
square.
Seven
are
the
seals
of
Revelation.
Seven
are
the
steps
of
the
Temple.
Centered
over
the
table
hung
a
carefully
calibrated
light
source
that
cycled
through
a
spectrum
of
preordained
colors,
completing
its
cycle
every
six
hours
in
accordance
with
the
sacred
Table
of
Planetary
Hours.
The
hour
ofYanor
is
blue.
The
hour
ofNasnia
is
red.
The
hour
ofSalam
is
white.
Now
was
the
hour
of
Caerra,
meaning
the
light
in
the
room
had
modulated
to
a
soft
purplish
hue.
Wearing
only
a
silken
loincloth
wrapped
around
his
buttocks
and
neutered
sex
organ,
Mal'akh
began
his
preparations.
He
carefully
combined
the
suffumigation
chemicals
that
he
would
later
ignite
to
sanctify
the
air.
Then
he
folded
the
virgin
silk
robe
that
he
would
eventually
don
in
place
of
his
loincloth.
And
finally,
he
purified
a
flask
of
water
for
the
anointing
of
his
offering.
When
he
was
done,
he
placed
all
of
these
prepared
ingredients
on
a
side
table.
Next
he
went
to
a
shelf
and
retrieved
a
small
ivory
box,
which
he
carried
to
the
side
table
and
placed
with
the
other
items.
Although
he
was
not
yet
ready
to
use
it,
he
could
not
resist
opening
the
lid
and
admiring
this
treasure.
The
knife.
Inside
the
ivory
box,
nestled
in
a
cradle
of
black
velvet,
shone
the
sacrificial
knife
that
Mal'akh
had
been
saving
for
tonight.
He
had
purchased
it
for
$1.6
million
on
the
Middle
Eastern
antiquities
black
market
last
year.
The
most
famous
knife
in
history.
Unimaginably
old
and
believed
lost,
this
precious
blade
was
made
of
iron,
attached
to
a
bone
handle.
Over
the
ages,
it
had
been
in
the
possession
of
countless
powerful
individuals.
In
recent
decades,
however,
it
had
disappeared,
languishing
in
a
secret
private
collection.
Mal'akh
had
gone
to
enormous
lengths
to
obtain
it.
The
knife,
he
suspected,
had
not
drawn
blood
for
decades
possibly
centuries.
Tonight,
this
blade
would
again
taste
the
power
of
the
sacrifice
for
which
it
was
honed.
Mal'akh
gently
lifted
the
knife
from
its
cushioned
compartment
and
reverently
polished
the
blade
with
a
silk
cloth
soaked
in
purified
water.
His
skills
had
progressed
greatly
since
his
first
rudimentary
experiments
in
New
York.
The
dark
Art
that
Mal'akh
practiced
had
been
known
by
many
names
in
many
languages,
but
by
any
name,
it
was
a
precise
science.
This
primeval
technology
had
once
held
the
key
to
the
portals
of
power,
but
it
had
been
banished
long
ago,
relegated
to
the
shadows
of
occultism
and
magic.
Those
few
who
still
practiced
this
Art
were
considered
madmen,
but
Mal'akh
knew
better.
This
is
not
work
for
those
with
dull
faculties.
The
ancient
dark
Art,
like
modern
science,
was
a
discipline
involving
precise
formulas,
specific
ingredients,
and
meticulous
timing.
This
Art
was
not
the
impotent
black
magic
of
today,
often
practiced
halfheartedly
by
curious
souls.
This
Art,
like
nuclear
physics,
had
the
potential
to
unleash
enormous
power.
The
warnings
were
dire:
The
unskilled
practitioner
runs
the
risk
of
being
struck
by
a
reflux
current
and
destroyed.
Mal'akh
finished
admiring
the
sacred
blade
and
turned
his
attention
to
a
lone
sheet
of
thick
vellum
lying
on
the
table
before
him.
He
had
made
this
vellum
himself
from
the
skin
of
a
baby
lamb.
As
was
the
protocol,
the
lamb
was
pure,
having
not
yet
reached
sexual
maturity.
Beside
the
vellum
was
a
quill
pen
he
had
made
from
the
feather
of
a
crow,
a
silver
saucer,
and
three
glimmering
candles
arranged
around
a
solid-brass
bowl.
The
bowl
contained
one
inch
of
thick
crimson
liquid.
The
liquid
was
Peter
Solomon's
blood.
Blood
is
the
tincture
of
eternity.
Mal'akh
picked
up
the
quill
pen,
placed
his
left
hand
on
the
vellum,
and
dipping
the
quill
tip
in
the
blood,
he
carefully
traced
the
outline
of
his
open
palm.
When
he
was
done,
he
added
the
five
symbols
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries,
one
on
each
fingertip
of
the
drawing.
The
crown
to
represent
the
king
I
shall
become.
The
star
to
represent
the
heavens
which
have
ordained
my
destiny.
The
sun
to
represent
the
illumination
of
my
soul.
The
lantern
to
represent
the
feeble
light
of
human
understanding.
And
the
key
to
represent
the
missing
piece,
that
which
tonight
I
shall
at
last
possess.
Mal'akh
completed
his
blood
tracing
and
held
up
the
vellum,
admiring
his
work
in
the
light
of
the
three
candles.
He
waited
until
the
blood
was
dry
and
then
folded
the
thick
vellum
three
times.
While
chanting
an
ethereal
ancient
incantation,
Mal'akh
touched
the
vellum
to
the
third
candle,
and
it
burst
into
flames.
He
set
the
flaming
vellum
on
the
silver
saucer
and
let
it
burn.
As
it
did,
the
carbon
in
the
animal
skin
dissolved
to
a
powdery
black
char.
When
the
flame
went
out,
Mal'akh
carefully
tapped
the
ashes
into
the
brass
bowl
of
blood.
Then
he
stirred
the
mixture
with
the
crow's
feather.
The
liquid
turned
a
deeper
crimson,
nearly
black.
Holding
the
bowl
in
both
palms,
Mal'akh
raised
it
over
his
head
and
gave
thanks,
intoning
the
blood
eukharistos
of
the
ancients.
Then
he
carefully
poured
the
blackened
mixture
into
a
glass
vial
and
corked
it.
This
would
be
the
ink
with
which
Mal'akh
would
inscribe
the
untattooed
flesh
atop
his
head
and
complete
his
masterpiece.
Washington
National
Cathedral
is
the
sixth-largest
cathedral
in
the
world
and
soars
higher
than
a
thirty-
story
skyscraper.
Embellished
with
over
two
hundred
stained-glass
windows,
a
fifty-three-bell
carillon,
and
a
10,647
-pipe
organ,
this
Gothic
masterpiece
can
accommodate
more
than
three
thousand
worshippers.
Tonight,
however,
the
great
cathedral
was
deserted.
Reverend
Colin
Galloway
dean
of
the
cathedral
looked
like
he
had
been
alive
forever.
Stooped
and
withered,
he
wore
a
simple
black
cassock
and
shuffled
blindly
ahead
without
a
word.
Langdon
and
Katherine
followed
in
silence
through
the
darkness
of
the
four-hundred-foot-long
nave's
central
aisle,
which
was
curved
ever
so
slightly
to
the
left
to
create
a
softening
optical
illusion.
When
they
reached
the
Great
Crossing,
the
dean
guided
them
through
the
rood
screen
the
symbolic
divider
between
the
public
area
and
the
sanctuary
beyond.
The
scent
of
frankincense
hung
in
the
air
of
the
chancel.
This
sacred
space
was
dark,
illuminated
only
by
indirect
reflections
in
the
foliated
vaults
overhead.
Flags
of
the
fifty
states
hung
above
the
quire,
which
was
ornately
appointed
with
several
carved
reredos
depicting
biblical
events.
Dean
Galloway
continued
on,
apparently
knowing
this
walk
by
heart.
For
a
moment,
Langdon
thought
they
were
headed
straight
for
the
high
altar,
where
the
ten
stones
from
Mount
Sinai
were
embedded,
but
the
old
dean
finally
turned
left
and
groped
his
way
through
a
discreetly
hidden
door
that
led
into
an
administrative
annex.
They
moved
down
a
short
hallway
to
an
office
door
bearing
a
brass
nameplate:
THE
REVEREND
DR.
COLIN
GALLOWAY
CATHEDRAL
DEAN
Galloway
opened
the
door
and
turned
on
the
lights,
apparently
accustomed
to
remembering
this
courtesy
for
his
guests.
He
ushered
them
in
and
closed
the
door.
The
dean's
office
was
small
but
elegant,
with
high
bookshelves,
a
desk,
a
carved
armoire,
and
a
private
bathroom.
On
the
walls
hung
sixteenth-century
tapestries
and
several
religious
paintings.
The
old
dean
motioned
to
the
two
leather
chairs
directly
opposite
his
desk.
Langdon
sat
with
Katherine
and
felt
grateful
finally
to
set
his
heavy
shoulder
bag
on
the
floor
at
his
feet.
Sanctuary
and
answers,
Langdon
thought,
settling
into
the
comfortable
chair.
The
aged
man
shuffled
around
behind
his
desk
and
eased
himself
down
into
his
high-backed
chair.
Then,
with
a
weary
sigh,
he
raised
his
head,
staring
blankly
out
at
them
through
clouded
eyes.
When
he
spoke,
his
voice
was
unexpectedly
clear
and
strong.
"I
realize
we
have
never
met,"
the
old
man
said,
"and
yet
I
feel
I
know
you
both."
He
took
out
a
handkerchief
and
dabbed
his
mouth.
"Professor
Langdon,
I
am
familiar
with
your
writings,
including
the
clever
piece
you
did
on
the
symbolism
of
this
cathedral.
And,
Ms.
Solomon,
your
brother,
Peter,
and
I
have
been
Masonic
brothers
for
many
years
now."
"Peter
is
in
terrible
trouble,"
Katherine
said.
"So
I
have
been
told."
The
old
man
sighed.
"And
I
will
do
everything
in
my
power
to
help
you."
Langdon
saw
no
Masonic
ring
on
the
dean's
finger,
and
yet
he
knew
many
Masons,
especially
those
within
the
clergy,
chose
not
to
advertise
their
affiliation.
As
they
began
to
talk,
it
became
clear
that
Dean
Galloway
already
knew
some
of
the
night's
events
from
Warren
Bellamy's
phone
message.
As
Langdon
and
Katherine
filled
him
in
on
the
rest,
the
dean
looked
more
and
more
troubled.
"And
this
man
who
has
taken
our
beloved
Peter,"
the
dean
said,
"he
is
insisting
you
decipher
the
pyramid
in
exchange
for
Peter's
life?"
"Yes,"
Langdon
said.
"He
thinks
it's
a
map
that
will
lead
him
to
the
hiding
place
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries."
The
dean
turned
his
eerie,
opaque
eyes
toward
Langdon.
"My
ears
tell
me
you
do
not
believe
in
such
things."
Langdon
did
not
want
to
waste
time
going
down
this
road.
"It
doesn't
matter
what
I
believe.
We
need
to
help
Peter.
Unfortunately,
when
we
deciphered
the
pyramid,
it
pointed
nowhere."
The
old
man
sat
straighter.
"You've
deciphered
the
pyramid?"
Katherine
interceded
now,
quickly
explaining
that
despite
Bellamy's
warnings
and
her
brother's
request
that
Langdon
not
unwrap
the
package,
she
had
done
so,
feeling
her
first
priority
was
to
help
her
brother
however
she
could.
She
told
the
dean
about
the
golden
capstone,
Albrecht
Durer's
magic
square,
and
how
it
decrypted
the
sixteen-letter
Masonic
cipher
into
the
phrase
Jeova
Sanctus
Unus.
"That's
all
it
says?"
the
dean
asked.
"One
True
God?"
"Yes,
sir,"
Langdon
replied.
"Apparently
the
pyramid
is
more
of
a
metaphorical
map
than
a
geographic
one."
The
dean
held
out
his
hands.
"Let
me
feel
it."
Langdon
unzipped
his
bag
and
pulled
out
the
pyramid,
which
he
carefully
hoisted
up
on
the
desk,
setting
it
directly
in
front
of
the
reverend.
Langdon
and
Katherine
watched
as
the
old
man's
frail
hands
examined
every
inch
of
the
stone
the
engraved
side,
the
smooth
base,
and
the
truncated
top.
When
he
was
finished,
he
held
out
his
hands
again.
"And
the
capstone?"
Langdon
retrieved
the
small
stone
box,
set
it
on
the
desk,
and
opened
the
lid.
Then
he
removed
the
capstone
and
placed
it
into
the
old
man's
waiting
hands.
The
dean
performed
a
similar
examination,
feeling
every
inch,
pausing
on
the
capstone's
engraving,
apparently
having
some
trouble
reading
the
small,
elegantly
inscribed
text.
'"The
secret
hides
within
The
Order,'"
Langdon
offered.
"And
the
words
the
and
order
are
capitalized."
The
old
man's
face
was
expressionless
as
he
positioned
the
capstone
on
top
of
the
pyramid
and
aligned
it
by
sense
of
touch.
He
seemed
to
pause
a
moment,
as
if
in
prayer,
and
reverently
ran
his
palms
over
the
complete
pyramid
several
times.
Then
he
reached
out
and
located
the
cube-shaped
box,
taking
it
in
his
hands,
feeling
it
carefully,
his
fingers
probing
inside
and
out.
When
he
was
done,
he
set
down
the
box
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair.
"So
tell
me,"
he
demanded,
his
voice
suddenly
stern.
"Why
have
you
come
to
me?"
The
question
took
Langdon
off
guard.
"We
came,
sir,
because
you
told
us
to.
And
Mr.
Bellamy
said
we
should
trust
you."
"And
yet
you
did
not
trust
himT
"I'm
sorry?"
The
dean's
white
eyes
stared
directly
through
Langdon.
"The
package
containing
the
capstone
was
sealed.
Mr.
Bellamy
told
you
not
to
open
it,
and
yet
you
did.
In
addition,
Peter
Solomon
himself
told
you
not
to
open
it.
And
yet
you
did."
"Sir,"
Katherine
intervened,
"we
were
trying
to
help
my
brother.
The
man
who
has
him
demanded
we
decipher
"I
can
appreciate
that,"
the
dean
declared,
"and
yet
what
have
you
achieved
by
opening
the
package?
Nothing.
Peter's
captor
is
looking
for
a
location,
and
he
will
not
be
satisfied
with
the
answer
of
Jeova
Sanctus
Unus."
"I
agree,"
Langdon
said,
"but
unfortunately
that's
all
the
pyramid
says.
As
I
mentioned,
the
map
seems
to
be
more
figurative
than
"You're
mistaken,
Professor,"
the
dean
said.
"The
Masonic
Pyramid
is
a
real
map.
It
points
to
a
real
location.
You
do
not
understand
that,
because
you
have
not
yet
deciphered
the
pyramid
fully.
Not
even
close."
Langdon
and
Katherine
exchanged
startled
looks.
The
dean
laid
his
hands
back
on
the
pyramid,
almost
caressing
it.
"This
map,
like
the
Ancient
Mysteries
themselves,
has
many
layers
of
meaning.
Its
true
secret
remains
veiled
from
you."
"Dean
Galloway,"
Langdon
said,
"we've
been
over
every
inch
of
the
pyramid
and
capstone,
and
there's
nothing
else
to
see."
"Not
in
its
current
state,
no.
But
objects
change."
"Sir?"
"Professor,
as
you
know,
the
promise
of
this
pyramid
is
one
of
miraculous
transformative
power.
Legend
holds
that
this
pyramid
can
change
its
shape
alter
its
physical
form
to
reveal
its
secrets.
Like
the
famed
stone
that
released
Excalibur
into
the
hands
of
King
Arthur,
the
Masonic
Pyramid
can
transform
itself
if
it
so
chooses
and
reveal
its
secret
to
the
worthy."
Langdon
now
sensed
that
the
old
man's
advanced
years
had
perhaps
robbed
him
of
his
faculties.
"I'm
sorry,
sir.
Are
you
saying
this
pyramid
can
undergo
a
literal
physical
transformation?"
"Professor,
if
I
were
to
reach
out
with
my
hand
and
transform
this
pyramid
right
before
your
eyes,
would
you
believe
what
you
had
witnessed?"
Langdon
had
no
idea
how
to
respond.
"I
suppose
I
would
have
no
choice."
"Very
well,
then.
In
a
moment,
I
shall
do
exactly
that."
He
dabbed
his
mouth
again.
"Let
me
remind
you
that
there
was
an
era
when
even
the
brightest
minds
perceived
the
earth
as
flat.
For
if
the
earth
were
round,
then
surely
the
oceans
would
spill
off.
Imagine
how
they
would
have
mocked
you
if
you
proclaimed,
'Not
only
is
the
world
a
sphere,
but
there
is
an
invisible,
mystical
force
that
holds
everything
to
its
surface'
!"
"There's
a
difference,"
Langdon
said,
"between
the
existence
of
gravity
and
the
ability
to
transform
objects
with
a
touch
of
your
hand."
"Is
there?
Is
it
not
possible
that
we
are
still
living
in
the
Dark
Ages,
still
mocking
the
suggestion
of
'mystical'
forces
that
we
cannot
see
or
comprehend.
History,
if
it
has
taught
us
anything
at
all,
has
taught
us
that
the
strange
ideas
we
deride
today
will
one
day
be
our
celebrated
truths.
I
claim
I
can
transform
this
pyramid
with
a
touch
of
my
finger,
and
you
question
my
sanity.
I
would
expect
more
from
an
historian.
History
is
replete
with
great
minds
who
have
all
proclaimed
the
same
thing
great
minds
who
have
all
insisted
that
man
possesses
mystical
abilities
of
which
he
is
unaware."
Langdon
knew
the
dean
was
correct.
The
famous
Hermetic
aphorism
Know
ye
not
that
ye
are
gods?
was
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries.
As
above,
so
below
Man
created
in
God's
image
Apotheosis.
This
persistent
message
of
man's
own
divinity
of
his
hidden
potential
was
the
recurring
theme
in
the
ancient
texts
of
countless
traditions.
Even
the
Holy
Bible
cried
out
in
Psalms
82:6:
Ye
are
gods!
"Professor,"
the
old
man
said,
"I
realize
thatyow,
like
many
educated
people,
live
trapped
between
worlds
one
foot
in
the
spiritual,
one
foot
in
the
physical.
Your
heart
yearns
to
believe
but
your
intellect
refuses
to
permit
it.
As
an
academic,
you
would
be
wise
to
learn
from
the
great
minds
of
history."
He
paused
and
cleared
his
throat.
"If
I'm
remembering
correctly,
one
of
the
greatest
minds
ever
to
live
proclaimed:
'That
which
is
impenetrable
to
us
really
exists.
Behind
the
secrets
of
nature
remains
something
subtle,
intangible,
and
inexplicable.
Veneration
for
this
force
beyond
anything
that
we
can
comprehend
is
my
religion.'
"Who
said
that?"
Langdon
said.
"Gandhi?"
"No,"
Katherine
interjected.
"Albert
Einstein."
Katherine
Solomon
had
read
every
word
Einstein
had
ever
written
and
was
struck
by
his
profound
respect
for
the
mystical,
as
well
as
his
predictions
that
the
masses
would
one
day
feel
the
same.
The
religion
of
the
future,
Einstein
had
predicted,
will
be
a
cosmic
religion.
It
will
transcend
personal
God
and
avoid
dogma
and
theology.
Robert
Langdon
appeared
to
be
struggling
with
the
idea.
Katherine
could
sense
his
rising
frustration
with
the
old
Episcopal
priest,
and
she
understood.
After
all,
they
had
traveled
here
for
answers,
and
they
had
found
instead
a
blind
man
who
claimed
he
could
transform
objects
with
a
touch
of
his
hands.
Even
so,
the
old
man's
overt
passion
for
mystical
forces
reminded
Katherine
of
her
brother.
"Father
Galloway,"
Katherine
said,
"Peter
is
in
trouble.
The
CIA
is
chasing
us.
And
Warren
Bellamy
sent
us
to
you
for
help.
I
don't
know
what
this
pyramid
says
or
where
it
points,
but
if
deciphering
it
means
that
we
can
help
Peter,
we
need
to
do
that.
Mr.
Bellamy
may
have
preferred
to
sacrifice
my
brother's
life
to
hide
this
pyramid,
but
my
family
has
experienced
nothing
but
pain
because
of
it.
Whatever
secret
it
may
hold,
it
ends
tonight."
"You
are
correct,"
the
old
man
replied,
his
tone
dire.
"It
will
all
end
tonight.
You've
guaranteed
that."
He
sighed.
"Ms.
Solomon,
when
you
broke
the
seal
on
that
box,
you
set
in
motion
a
series
of
events
from
which
there
will
be
no
return.
There
are
forces
at
work
tonight
that
you
do
not
yet
comprehend.
There
is
no
turning
back."
Katherine
stared
dumbfounded
at
the
reverend.
There
was
something
apocalyptic
about
his
tone,
as
if
he
were
referring
to
the
Seven
Seals
of
Revelation
or
Pandora's
box.
"Respectfully,
sir,"
Langdon
interceded,
"I
can't
imagine
how
a
stone
pyramid
could
set
in
motion
anything
at
all."
"Of
course
you
can't,
Professor."
The
old
man
stared
blindly
through
him.
"You
do
not
yet
have
eyes
to
see."
In
the
moist
air
of
the
Jungle,
the
Architect
of
the
Capitol
could
feel
the
sweat
now
rolling
down
his
back.
His
handcuffed
wrists
ached,
but
all
of
his
attention
remained
riveted
on
the
ominous
titanium
briefcase
that
Sato
had
just
opened
on
the
bench
between
them.
The
contents
of
this
case,
Sato
had
told
him,
will
persuade
you
to
see
things
my
way.
I
guarantee
it.
The
tiny
Asian
woman
had
unclasped
the
metal
case
away
from
Bellamy's
line
of
sight,
and
he
had
yet
to
see
its
contents,
but
his
imagination
was
running
wild.
Sato's
hands
were
doing
something
inside
the
case,
and
Bellamy
half
expected
her
to
extract
a
series
of
glistening,
razor-sharp
tools.
Suddenly
a
light
source
flickered
inside
the
case,
growing
brighter,
illuminating
Sato's
face
from
beneath.
Her
hands
kept
moving
inside,
and
the
light
changed
hue.
After
a
few
moments,
she
removed
her
hands,
grasped
the
entire
case,
and
turned
it
toward
Bellamy
so
he
could
see
inside.
Bellamy
found
himself
squinting
into
the
glow
of
what
appeared
to
be
some
kind
of
futuristic
laptop
with
a
handheld
phone
receiver,
two
antennae,
and
a
double
keyboard.
His
initial
surge
of
relief
turned
quickly
to
confusion.
The
screen
bore
the
CIA
logo
and
the
text:
SECURE
LOG-IN
USER:
INOUE
SATO
SECURITY
CLEARANCE:
LEVEL
5
Beneath
the
laptop's
log-in
window,
a
progress
icon
was
spinning:
ONE
MOMENT
PLEASE
DECRYPTING
FILE
Bellamy's
gaze
shot
back
up
to
Sato,
whose
eyes
were
locked
on
his.
"I
had
not
wanted
to
show
you
this,"
she
said.
"But
you've
left
me
no
choice."
The
screen
flickered
again,
and
Bellamy
glanced
back
down
as
the
file
opened,
its
contents
filling
the
entire
LCD.
For
several
moments,
Bellamy
stared
at
the
screen,
trying
to
make
sense
of
what
he
was
looking
at.
Gradually,
as
it
began
to
dawn
on
him,
he
felt
the
blood
draining
from
his
face.
He
stared
in
horror,
unable
to
look
away.
"But
this
is
impossible!"
he
exclaimed.
"How
could
this
be!"
Sato's
face
was
grim.
"You
tell
me,
Mr.
Bellamy.
You
tell
me."
As
the
Architect
of
the
Capitol
began
to
fully
comprehend
the
ramifications
of
what
he
was
seeing,
he
could
feel
his
entire
world
teetering
precariously
on
the
brink
of
disaster.
My
God
I've
made
a
terrible,
terrible
mistake!
Dean
Galloway
felt
alive.
Like
all
mortals,
he
knew
the
time
was
coming
when
he
would
shed
his
mortal
shell,
but
tonight
was
not
the
night.
His
corporeal
heart
was
beating
strong
and
fast
and
his
mind
felt
sharp.
There
is
work
to
be
done.
As
he
ran
his
arthritic
hands
across
the
pyramid's
smooth
surfaces,
he
could
scarcely
believe
what
he
was
feeling.
/
never
imagined
I
would
live
to
witness
this
moment.
For
generations,
the
pieces
of
the
symbolon
map
had
been
kept
safely
apart
from
one
another.
Now
they
were
united
at
last.
Galloway
wondered
if
this
was
the
foretold
time.
Strangely,
fate
had
selected
two
non-Masons
to
assemble
the
pyramid.
Somehow,
this
seemed
fitting.
The
Mysteries
are
moving
out
of
the
inner
circles
out
of
darkness
into
the
light.
"Professor,"
he
said,
turning
his
head
in
the
direction
of
Langdon's
breathing.
"Did
Peter
tell
you
why
he
wanted
you
to
watch
over
the
little
package?"
"He
said
powerful
people
wanted
to
steal
it
from
him,"
Langdon
replied.
The
dean
nodded.
"Yes,
Peter
told
me
the
same
thing."
"He
did?"
Katherine
said
suddenly
on
his
left.
"You
and
my
brother
spoke
about
this
pyramid?"
"Of
course,"
Galloway
said.
"Your
brother
and
I
have
spoken
on
many
things.
I
was
once
the
Worshipful
Master
at
the
House
of
the
Temple,
and
he
comes
to
me
for
guidance
at
times.
It
was
about
a
year
ago
that
he
came
to
me,
deeply
troubled.
He
sat
exactly
where
you
are
now,
and
he
asked
me
if
I
believed
in
supernatural
premonitions."
"Premonitions?"
Katherine
sounded
concerned.
"You
mean
like
visionsV
"Not
exactly.
It
was
more
visceral.
Peter
said
he
was
feeling
the
growing
presence
of
a
dark
force
in
his
life.
He
sensed
something
was
watching
him
waiting
intending
to
do
him
great
harm."
"Obviously
he
was
right,"
Katherine
said,
"considering
that
the
same
man
who
killed
our
mother
and
Peter's
son
had
come
to
Washington
and
become
one
of
Peter's
own
Masonic
brothers."
"True,"
Langdon
said,
"but
it
doesn't
explain
the
involvement
of
the
CIA."
Galloway
was
not
so
sure.
"Men
in
power
are
always
interested
in
greater
power."
"But
the
CIA?"
Langdon
challenged.
"And
mystical
secrets?
Something
doesn't
add
up."
"Sure
it
does,"
Katherine
said.
"The
CIA
thrives
on
technological
advancement
and
has
always
experimented
with
the
mystical
sciences
ESP,
remote
viewing,
sensory
deprivation,
pharmacologically
induced
highly
mentalized
states.
It's
all
the
same
thing
tapping
the
unseen
potential
of
the
human
mind.
If
there's
one
thing
I've
learned
from
Peter,
it's
this:
Science
and
mysticism
are
very
closely
related,
distinguishable
only
by
their
approaches.
They
have
identical
goals
but
different
methods."
"Peter
tells
me,"
Galloway
said,
"that
your
field
of
study
is
a
kind
of
modern
mystical
science?"
"Noetics,"
Katherine
said,
nodding.
"And
it's
proving
man
has
powers
unlike
anything
we
can
imagine."
She
motioned
to
a
stained-glass
window
depicting
the
familiar
image
of
the
"Luminous
Jesus,"
that
of
Christ
with
rays
of
light
flowing
from
his
head
and
hands.
"In
fact,
I
just
used
a
supercooled
charge-coupled
device
to
photograph
the
hands
of
a
faith
healer
at
work.
The
photos
looked
a
lot
like
the
image
of
Jesus
in
your
stained-glass
window
streams
of
energy
pouring
through
the
healer's
fingertips."
The
well-trained
mind,
Galloway
thought,
hiding
a
smile.
How
do
you
think
Jesus
healed
the
sick?
"I
realize,"
Katherine
said,
"that
modern
medicine
ridicules
healers
and
shamans,
but
I
saw
this
with
my
own
eyes.
My
CCD
cameras
clearly
photographed
this
man
transmitting
a
massive
energy
field
from
his
fingertips
and
literally
changing
the
cellular
makeup
of
his
patient.
If
that's
not
godlike
power,
then
I
don't
know
what
is."
Dean
Galloway
let
himself
smile.
Katherine
had
the
same
fiery
passion
as
her
brother.
"Peter
once
compared
Noetic
Scientists
to
the
early
explorers
who
were
mocked
for
embracing
the
heretical
notion
of
a
spherical
earth.
Almost
overnight,
these
explorers
went
from
fools
to
heroes,
discovering
uncharted
worlds
and
expanding
the
horizons
of
everyone
on
the
planet.
Peter
thinks
you
will
do
this
as
well.
He
has
very
high
hopes
for
your
work.
After
all,
every
great
philosophical
shift
in
history
began
with
a
single
bold
idea."
Galloway
knew,
of
course,
that
one
needn't
go
to
a
lab
to
witness
proof
of
this
bold
new
idea,
this
proposal
of
man's
untapped
potential.
This
very
cathedral
held
healing
prayer
circles
for
the
sick,
and
repeatedly
had
witnessed
truly
miraculous
results,
medically
documented
physical
transformations.
The
question
was
not
whether
God
had
imbued
man
with
great
powers
but
rather
how
we
liberate
those
powers.
The
old
dean
placed
his
hands
reverently
around
the
sides
of
the
Masonic
Pyramid
and
spoke
very
quietly.
"My
friends,
I
do
not
know
exactly
where
this
pyramid
points
but
I
do
know
this.
There
is
a
great
spiritual
treasure
buried
out
there
somewhere
a
treasure
that
has
waited
patiently
in
darkness
for
generations.
I
believe
it
is
a
catalyst
that
has
the
power
to
transform
this
world."
He
now
touched
the
golden
tip
of
the
capstone.
"And
now
that
this
pyramid
is
assembled
the
time
is
fast
approaching.
And
why
shouldn't
it?
The
promise
of
a
great
transformational
enlightenment
has
been
prophesied
forever."
"Father,"
Langdon
said,
his
tone
challenging,
"we're
all
familiar
with
the
Revelation
of
Saint
John
and
the
literal
meaning
of
the
Apocalypse,
but
biblical
prophecy
hardly
seems
"Oh,
heavens,
the
Book
of
Revelation
is
a
mess!"
the
dean
said.
"Nobody
knows
how
to
read
that.
I'm
talking
about
clear
minds
writing
in
clear
language
the
predictions
of
Saint
Augustine,
Sir
Francis
Bacon,
Newton,
Einstein,
the
list
goes
on
and
on,
all
anticipating
a
transformative
moment
of
enlightenment.
Even
Jesus
himself
said,
'Nothing
is
hidden
that
will
not
be
made
known,
nor
secret
that
will
not
come
to
light.'"
"It's
a
safe
prediction
to
make,"
Langdon
said.
"Knowledge
grows
exponentially.
The
more
we
know,
the
greater
our
ability
to
learn,
and
the
faster
we
expand
our
knowledge
base."
"Yes,"
Katherine
added.
"We
see
this
in
science
all
the
time.
Each
new
technology
we
invent
becomes
a
tool
with
which
to
invent
new
technologies
and
it
snowballs.
That's
why
science
has
advanced
more
in
the
last
five
years
than
in
the
previous
five
thousand.
Exponential
growth.
Mathematically,
as
time
passes,
the
exponential
curve
of
progress
becomes
almost
vertical,
and
new
development
occurs
incredibly
fast."
Silence
fell
in
the
dean's
office,
and
Galloway
sensed
that
his
two
guests
still
had
no
idea
how
this
pyramid
could
possibly
help
them
reveal
anything
further.
That
is
why
fate
brought
you
to
me,
he
thought.
/
have
a
role
to
play.
For
many
years,
the
Reverend
Colin
Galloway,
along
with
his
Masonic
brothers,
had
played
the
role
of
gatekeeper.
Now
it
was
all
changing.
/
am
no
longer
a
gatekeeper
I
am
a
guide.
"Professor
Langdon?"
Galloway
said,
reaching
out
across
his
desk.
"Take
my
hand
if
you
will."
Robert
Langdon
felt
uncertain
as
he
stared
across
at
Dean
Galloway's
outstretched
palm.
Are
we
going
to
pray?
Politely,
Langdon
reached
out
and
placed
his
right
hand
in
the
dean's
withered
hand.
The
old
man
grasped
it
firmly
but
did
not
begin
to
pray.
Instead,
he
found
Langdon'
s
index
finger
and
guided
it
downward
into
the
stone
box
that
had
once
housed
the
golden
capstone.
"Your
eyes
have
blinded
you,"
the
dean
said.
"If
you
saw
with
your
fingertips
as
I
do,
you
would
realize
this
box
has
something
left
to
teach
you."
Dutifully,
Langdon
worked
his
fingertip
around
the
inside
of
the
box,
but
he
felt
nothing.
The
inside
was
perfectly
smooth.
"Keep
looking,"
Galloway
prompted.
Finally,
Langdon'
s
fingertip
felt
something
a
tiny
raised
circle
a
minuscule
dot
in
the
center
of
the
base
of
the
box.
He
removed
his
hand
and
peered
inside.
The
little
circle
was
virtually
invisible
to
the
naked
eye.
What
is
that?
"Do
you
recognize
that
symbol?"
Galloway
asked.
"Symbol?"
Langdon
replied.
"I
can
barely
see
anything
at
all."
"Push
down
on
it."
Langdon
did
as
he
asked,
pressing
his
fingertip
down
onto
the
spot.
What
does
he
think
will
happen?
"Hold
your
finger
down,"
the
dean
said.
"Apply
pressure."
Langdon
glanced
over
at
Katherine,
who
looked
puzzled
as
she
tucked
a
wisp
of
hair
behind
her
ears.
A
few
seconds
later,
the
old
dean
finally
nodded.
"Okay,
remove
your
hand.
The
alchemy
is
complete."
Alchemy?
Robert
Langdon
removed
his
hand
from
the
stone
box
and
sat
in
bewildered
silence.
Nothing
had
changed
at
all.
The
box
just
sat
there
on
the
desk.
"Nothing,"
Langdon
said.
"Look
at
your
fingertip,"
the
dean
replied.
"You
should
see
a
transformation."
Langdon
looked
at
his
finger,
but
the
only
transformation
he
could
see
was
that
he
now
had
an
indentation
on
his
skin
made
by
the
circular
nubbin
a
tiny
circle
with
a
dot
in
the
middle.
"Now
do
you
recognize
this
symbol?"
the
dean
asked.
Although
Langdon
recognized
the
symbol,
he
was
more
impressed
that
the
dean
had
been
able
to
feel
the
detail
of
it.
Seeing
with
one's
fingertips
was
apparently
a
learned
skill.
"It's
alchemical,"
Katherine
said,
sliding
her
chair
closer
and
examining
Langdon'
s
finger.
"It's
the
ancient
symbol
for
gold."
"Indeed
it
is."
The
dean
smiled
and
patted
the
box.
"Professor,
congratulations.
You
have
just
achieved
what
every
alchemist
in
history
has
strived
for.
From
a
worthless
substance,
you've
created
gold."
Langdon
frowned,
unimpressed.
The
little
parlor
trick
seemed
to
be
no
help
at
all.
"An
interesting
idea,
sir,
but
I'm
afraid
this
symbol
a
circle
with
a
round
dot
in
the
middle
has
dozens
of
meanings.
It's
called
a
circumpunct,
and
it's
one
of
the
most
widely
used
symbols
in
history."
"What
are
you
talking
about?"
the
dean
asked,
sounding
skeptical.
Langdon
was
stunned
that
a
Mason
was
not
more
familiar
with
the
spiritual
importance
of
this
symbol.
"Sir,
the
circumpunct
has
countless
meanings.
In
ancient
Egypt,
it
was
the
symbol
for
Ra
the
sun
god
and
modern
astronomy
still
uses
it
as
the
solar
symbol.
In
Eastern
philosophy,
it
represents
the
spiritual
insight
of
the
Third
Eye,
the
divine
rose,
and
the
sign
of
illumination.
The
Kabbalists
use
it
to
symbolize
the
Kether
the
highest
Sephiroth
and
'the
most
hidden
of
all
hidden
things.'
Early
mystics
called
it
the
Eye
of
God
and
it's
the
origin
of
the
All-Seeing
Eye
on
the
Great
Seal.
The
Pythagoreans
used
the
circumpunct
as
the
symbol
of
the
Monad
the
Divine
Truth,
the
Prisca
Sapientia,
the
at-one-ment
of
mind
and
soul,
and
the
"Enough!"
Dean
Galloway
was
chuckling
now.
"Professor,
thank
you.
You
are
correct,
of
course."
Langdon
now
realized
he
had
just
been
played.
He
knew
all
that.
"The
circumpunct,"
Galloway
said,
still
smiling
to
himself,
"is
essentially
the
symbol
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries.
For
this
reason,
I
would
suggest
that
its
presence
in
this
box
is
not
mere
coincidence.
Legend
holds
that
the
secrets
of
this
map
are
hidden
in
the
smallest
of
details."
"Fine,"
Katherine
said,
"but
even
if
this
symbol
was
inscribed
there
intentionally,
it
doesn't
bring
us
any
closer
to
deciphering
the
map,
does
it?"
"You
mentioned
earlier
that
the
wax
seal
you
broke
was
embossed
with
Peter's
ring?"
"That's
correct."
"And
you
said
you
have
that
ring
with
you?"
"I
do."
Langdon
reached
into
his
pocket,
found
the
ring,
took
it
out
of
the
plastic
bag,
and
placed
it
on
the
desk
in
front
of
the
dean.
Galloway
picked
up
the
ring
and
began
feeling
its
surfaces.
"This
unique
ring
was
created
at
the
same
time
as
the
Masonic
Pyramid,
and
traditionally,
it
is
worn
by
the
Mason
in
charge
of
protecting
the
pyramid.
Tonight,
when
I
felt
the
tiny
circumpunct
on
the
bottom
of
the
stone
box,
I
realized
that
the
ring
is,
in
fact,
part
of
the
symbolon."
"It
is?"
"I'm
certain
of
it.
Peter
is
my
closest
friend,
and
he
wore
this
ring
for
many
years.
I
am
quite
familiar
with
it."
He
handed
the
ring
to
Langdon.
"See
for
yourself."
Langdon
took
the
ring
and
examined
it,
running
his
fingers
over
the
double-headed
phoenix,
the
number
33,
the
words
ORDO
AB
CHAO,
and
also
the
words
All
is
revealed
at
the
thirty-third
degree.
He
felt
nothing
helpful.
Then,
as
his
fingers
traced
down
around
the
outside
of
the
band,
he
stopped
short.
Startled,
he
turned
the
ring
over
and
eyed
the
very
bottom
of
its
band.
"Did
you
find
it?"
Galloway
said.
"I
think
so,
yes!"
Langdon
said.
Katherine
slid
her
chair
closer.
"What?"
"The
degree
sign
on
the
band,"
Langdon
said,
showing
her.
"It's
so
small
that
you
don't
really
notice
it
with
your
eyes,
but
if
you
feel
it,
you
can
tell
it's
actually
indented
like
a
tiny
circular
incision."
The
degree
sign
was
centered
on
the
bottom
of
the
band
and
admittedly
looked
to
be
the
same
size
as
the
raised
nubbin
in
the
bottom
of
the
cube.
"Is
it
the
same
size?"
Katherine
moved
closer
still,
sounding
excited
now.
"There's
one
way
to
find
out."
He
took
the
ring
and
lowered
it
into
the
box,
aligning
the
two
tiny
circles.
As
he
pushed
down,
the
raised
circle
on
the
box
slid
into
the
ring's
opening,
and
there
was
a
faint
but
decisive
click.
They
all
jumped.
Langdon
waited,
but
nothing
happened.
"What
was
that?!"
the
priest
said.
"Nothing,"
Katherine
replied.
"The
ring
locked
into
place
but
nothing
else
happened."
"No
great
transformation?"
Galloway
looked
puzzled.
We're
not
done,
Langdon
realized,
gazing
down
at
the
ring's
embossed
insignia
a
double-headed
phoenix
and
the
number
33.
All
is
revealed
at
the
thirty
-third
degree.
His
mind
filled
with
thoughts
of
Pythagoras,
sacred
geometry,
and
angles;
he
wondered
if
perhaps
degrees
had
a
mathematical
meaning.
Slowly,
heart
beating
faster
now,
he
reached
down
and
grasped
the
ring,
which
was
affixed
to
the
base
of
the
cube.
Then,
slowly,
he
began
turning
the
ring
to
the
right.
All
is
revealed
at
the
thirty-third
degree.
He
turned
the
ring
ten
degrees
twenty
degrees
thirty
degrees
What
happened
next,
Langdon
never
saw
coming.
Transformation.
Dean
Galloway
heard
it
happen,
and
so
he
didn't
need
to
see
it.
Across
the
desk
from
him,
Langdon
and
Katherine
were
dead
silent,
no
doubt
staring
in
mute
astonishment
at
the
stone
cube,
which
had
just
transformed
itself
loudly
before
their
very
eyes.
Galloway
couldn't
help
but
smile.
He
had
anticipated
the
result,
and
although
he
still
had
no
idea
how
this
development
would
ultimately
help
them
solve
the
riddle
of
the
pyramid,
he
was
enjoying
the
rare
chance
to
teach
a
Harvard
symbologist
something
about
symbols.
"Professor,"
the
dean
said,
"few
people
realize
that
the
Masons
venerate
the
shape
of
the
cube
or
ashlar,
as
we
call
it
because
it
is
a
three-dimensional
representation
of
another
symbol
a
much
older,
two-
dimensional
symbol."
Galloway
didn't
need
to
ask
if
the
professor
recognized
the
ancient
symbol
now
lying
before
them
on
the
desk.
It
was
one
of
the
most
famous
symbols
in
the
world.
Robert
Langdon'
s
thoughts
churned
as
he
stared
at
the
transformed
box
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him.
/
had
no
idea
Moments
ago,
he
had
reached
into
the
stone
box,
grasped
the
Masonic
ring,
and
gently
turned
it.
As
he
rotated
the
ring
through
thirty-three
degrees,
the
cube
had
suddenly
changed
before
his
eyes.
The
square
panels
that
made
up
the
sides
of
the
box
fell
away
from
one
another
as
their
hidden
hinges
released.
The
box
collapsed
all
at
once,
its
side
panels
and
lid
falling
outward,
slapping
loudly
on
the
desk.
The
cube
becomes
a
cross,
Langdon
thought.
Symbolic
alchemy.
Katherine
looked
bewildered
by
the
sight
of
the
collapsed
cube.
"The
Masonic
Pyramid
relates
to
Christianity?"
For
a
moment,
Langdon
had
wondered
the
same
thing.
After
all,
the
Christian
crucifix
was
a
respected
symbol
within
the
Masons,
and
certainly
there
were
plenty
of
Christian
Masons.
However,
Masons
were
also
Jews,
Muslims,
Buddhists,
Hindus,
and
those
who
had
no
name
for
their
God.
The
presence
of
an
exclusively
Christian
symbol
seemed
restrictive.
Then
the
true
meaning
of
this
symbol
had
dawned
on
him.
"It's
not
a
crucifix,"
Langdon
said,
standing
up
now.
"The
cross
with
the
circumpunct
in
the
middle
is
a
binary
symbol
two
symbols
fused
to
create
one."
"What
are
you
saying?"
Katherine'
s
eyes
followed
him
as
he
paced
the
room.
"The
cross,"
Langdon
said,
"was
not
a
Christian
symbol
until
the
fourth
century.
Long
before
that,
it
was
used
by
the
Egyptians
to
represent
the
intersection
of
two
dimensions
the
human
and
the
celestial.
As
above,
so
below.
It
was
a
visual
representation
of
the
juncture
where
man
and
God
become
one."
"Okay."
"The
circumpunct,"
Langdon
said,
"we
already
know
has
many
meanings
one
of
its
most
esoteric
being
the
rose,
the
alchemical
symbol
for
perfection.
But,
when
you
place
a
rose
on
the
center
of
a
cross,
you
create
another
symbol
entirely
the
Rose
Cross."
Galloway
reclined
in
his
chair,
smiling.
"My,
my.
Now
you're
cooking."
Katherine
stood
now,
too.
"What
am
I
missing?"
"The
Rose
Cross,"
Langdon
explained,
"is
a
common
symbol
in
Freemasonry.
In
fact,
one
of
the
degrees
of
the
Scottish
Rite
is
called
'Knights
of
the
Rose
Cross'
and
honors
the
early
Rosicrucians,
who
contributed
to
Masonic
mystical
philosophy.
Peter
may
have
mentioned
the
Rosicrucians
to
you.
Dozens
of
great
scientists
were
members
John
Dee,
Elias
Ashmole,
Robert
Fludd
"Absolutely,"
Katherine
said.
"I've
read
all
of
the
Rosicrucian
manifestos
in
my
research."
Every
scientist
should,
Langdon
thought.
The
Order
of
the
Rose
Cross
or
more
formally
the
Ancient
and
Mystical
Order
Rosae
Crucis
had
an
enigmatic
history
that
had
greatly
influenced
science
and
closely
paralleled
the
legend
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries
early
sages
possessing
secret
wisdom
that
was
passed
down
through
the
ages
and
studied
by
only
the
brightest
minds.
Admittedly,
history's
list
of
famous
Rosicrucians
was
a
who's
who
of
European
Renaissance
luminaries:
Paracelsus,
Bacon,
Fludd,
Descartes,
Pascal,
Spinoza,
Newton,
Leibniz.
According
to
Rosicrucian
doctrine,
the
order
was
"built
on
esoteric
truths
of
the
ancient
past,"
truths
which
had
to
be
"concealed
from
the
average
man"
and
which
promised
great
insight
into
"the
spiritual
realm."
The
brotherhood's
symbol
had
blossomed
over
the
years
into
a
flowering
rose
on
an
ornate
cross,
but
it
had
begun
as
a
more
modest
dotted
circle
on
an
unadorned
cross
the
simplest
manifestation
of
the
rose
on
the
simplest
manifestation
of
the
cross.
"Peter
and
I
often
discuss
Rosicrucian
philosophy,"
Galloway
told
Katherine.
As
the
dean
began
outlining
the
interrelationship
between
Masonry
and
Rosicrucianism,
Langdon
felt
his
attention
drawn
back
to
the
same
nagging
thought
he'd
had
all
night.
Jeova
Sanctus
Unus.
This
phrase
is
linked
to
alchemy
somehow.
He
still
could
not
remember
exactly
what
Peter
had
told
him
about
the
phrase,
but
for
some
reason,
the
mention
of
Rosicrucianism
seemed
to
have
rekindled
the
thought.
Think,
Robert!
"The
Rosicrucian
founder,"
Galloway
was
saying,
"was
allegedly
a
German
mystic
who
went
by
the
name
Christian
Rosenkreuz
a
pseudonym
obviously,
perhaps
even
for
Francis
Bacon,
who
some
historians
believe
founded
the
group
himself,
although
there
is
no
proof
of
"A
pseudonym!"
Langdon
declared
suddenly,
startling
even
himself.
"That's
it!
Jeova
Sanctus
Unus!
It's
a
pseudonym!"
"What
are
you
talking
about?"
Katherine
demanded.
Langdon'
s
pulse
had
quickened
now.
"All
night,
I've
been
trying
to
remember
what
Peter
told
me
about
Jeova
Sanctus
Unus
and
its
relationship
to
alchemy.
Finally
I
remembered!
It's
not
about
alchemy
so
much
as
about
an
alchemistl
A
very
famous
alchemist!"
Galloway
chuckled.
"It's
about
time,
Professor.
I
mentioned
his
name
twice
and
also
the
word
pseudonym."
Langdon
stared
at
the
old
dean.
"You
knewT
"Well,
I
had
my
suspicions
when
you
told
me
the
engraving
said
Jeova
Sanctus
Unus
and
had
been
decrypted
using
Diirer's
alchemical
magic
square,
but
when
you
found
the
Rose
Cross,
I
was
certain.
As
you
probably
know,
the
personal
papers
of
the
scientist
in
question
included
a
very
heavily
annotated
copy
of
the
Rosicrucian
manifestos."
"Who?"
Katherine
asked.
"One
of
the
world's
greatest
scientists!"
Langdon
replied.
"He
was
an
alchemist,
a
member
of
the
Royal
Society
of
London,
a
Rosicrucian,
and
he
signed
some
of
his
most
secretive
science
papers
with
a
pseudonym
'Jeova
Sanctus
Unus'l"
"One
True
God?"
Katherine
said.
"Modest
guy."
"Brilliant
guy,
actually,"
Galloway
corrected.
"He
signed
his
name
that
way
because,
like
the
ancient
Adepts,
he
understood
himself
as
divine.
In
addition,
because
the
sixteen
letters
in
Jeova
Sanctus
Unus
could
be
rearranged
to
spell
his
name
in
Latin,
making
it
a
perfect
pseudonym."
Katherine
now
looked
puzzled.
"Jeova
Sanctus
Unus
is
an
anagram
of
a
famous
alchemist's
name
in
Latin?"
Langdon
grabbed
a
piece
of
paper
and
pencil
off
the
dean's
desk,
writing
as
he
talked.
"Latin
interchanges
the
letters
J
for
/
and
the
letter
V
for
U,
which
means
Jeova
Sanctus
Unus
can
actually
be
perfectly
rearranged
to
spell
this
man's
name."
Langdon
wrote
down
sixteen
letters:
Isaacus
Neutonuus.
He
handed
the
slip
of
paper
to
Katherine
and
said,
"I
think
you've
heard
of
him."
"Isaac
Newton?"
Katherine
demanded,
looking
at
the
paper.
"That's
what
the
engraving
on
the
pyramid
was
trying
to
tell
us!"
For
a
moment,
Langdon
was
back
in
Westminster
Abbey,
standing
at
Newton's
pyramidical
tomb,
where
he
had
experienced
a
similar
epiphany.
And
tonight,
the
great
scientist
surfaces
again.
It
was
no
coincidence,
of
course
the
pyramids,
mysteries,
science,
hidden
knowledge
it
was
all
intertwined.
Newton's
name
had
always
been
a
recurring
guidepost
for
those
seeking
secret
knowledge.
"Isaac
Newton,"
Galloway
said,
"must
have
something
to
do
with
how
to
decipher
the
meaning
of
the
pyramid.
I
can't
imagine
what
it
would
be,
but
"Genius!"
Katherine
exclaimed,
her
eyes
going
wide.
"That's
how
we
transform
the
pyramid!"
"You
understand?"
Langdon
said.
"Yes!"
she
said.
"I
can't
believe
we
didn't
see
it!
It
has
been
staring
us
right
in
the
face.
A
simple
alchemical
process.
I
can
transform
this
pyramid
using
basic
science!
Newtonian
science!"
Langdon
strained
to
understand.
"Dean
Galloway,"
Katherine
said.
"If
you
read
the
ring,
it
says
"Stop!"
The
old
dean
suddenly
raised
his
finger
in
the
air
and
motioned
for
silence.
Gently,
he
cocked
his
head
to
the
side,
as
if
he
were
listening
to
something.
After
a
moment,
he
stood
up
abruptly.
"My
friends,
this
pyramid
obviously
has
secrets
left
to
reveal.
I
don't
know
what
Ms.
Solomon
is
getting
at,
but
if
she
knows
your
next
step,
then
I
have
played
my
role.
Pack
up
your
things
and
say
no
more
to
me.
Leave
me
in
darkness
for
the
moment.
I
would
prefer
to
have
no
information
to
share
should
our
visitors
try
to
force
me."
"Visitors?"
Katherine
said,
listening.
"I
don't
hear
anyone."
"You
will,"
Galloway
said,
heading
for
the
door.
"Hurry."
Across
town,
a
cell
tower
was
attempting
to
contact
a
phone
that
lay
in
pieces
on
Massachusetts
Avenue.
Finding
no
signal,
it
redirected
the
call
to
voice
mail.
"Robert!"
Warren
Bellamy's
panicked
voice
shouted.
"Where
are
you?!
Call
me!
Something
terrible
is
happening!"
In
the
cerulean
glow
of
his
basement
lights,
Mal'akh
stood
at
the
stone
table
and
continued
his
preparations.
As
he
worked,
his
empty
stomach
growled.
He
paid
no
heed.
His
days
of
servitude
to
the
whims
of
his
flesh
were
behind
him.
Transformation
requires
sacrifice.
Like
many
of
history's
most
spiritually
evolved
men,
Mal'akh
had
committed
to
his
path
by
making
the
noblest
of
flesh
sacrifices.
Castration
had
been
less
painful
than
he
had
imagined.
And,
he
had
learned,
far
more
common.
Every
year,
thousands
of
men
underwent
surgical
gelding
orchiectomy,
as
the
process
was
known
their
motivations
ranging
from
transgender
issues,
to
curbing
sexual
addictions,
to
deep-seated
spiritual
beliefs.
For
Mal'akh,
the
reasons
were
of
the
highest
nature.
Like
the
mythological
self-castrated
Attis,
Mal'akh
knew
that
achieving
immortality
required
a
clean
break
with
the
material
world
of
male
and
female.
The
androgyne
is
one.
Nowadays,
eunuchs
were
shunned,
although
the
ancients
understood
the
inherent
power
of
this
transmutational
sacrifice.
Even
the
early
Christians
had
heard
Jesus
Himself
extol
its
virtues
in
Matthew
19:12:
"There
are
those
who
have
made
themselves
eunuchs
for
the
sake
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven.
He
who
is
able
to
accept
this,
let
him
accept
it.
Peter
Solomon
had
made
a
flesh
sacrifice,
although
a
single
hand
was
a
small
price
in
the
grand
scheme.
By
night's
end,
however,
Solomon
would
be
sacrificing
much,
much
more.
In
order
to
create,
I
must
destroy.
Such
was
the
nature
of
polarity.
Peter
Solomon,
of
course,
deserved
the
fate
that
awaited
him
tonight.
It
would
be
a
fitting
end.
Long
ago,
he
had
played
the
pivotal
role
in
Mal'akh's
mortal
life
path.
For
this
reason,
Peter
had
been
chosen
to
play
the
pivotal
role
in
Mal'akh's
great
transformation.
This
man
had
earned
all
the
horror
and
pain
he
was
about
to
endure.
Peter
Solomon
was
not
the
man
the
world
believed
he
was.
He
sacrificed
his
own
son.
Peter
Solomon
had
once
presented
his
son,
Zachary,
with
an
impossible
choice
wealth
or
wisdom.
Zachary
chose
poorly.
The
boy's
decision
had
begun
a
chain
of
events
that
eventually
dragged
the
young
man
into
the
depths
of
hell.
Soganlik
Prison.
Zachary
Solomon
had
died
in
that
Turkish
prison.
The
whole
world
knew
the
story
but
what
they
didn't
know
was
that
Peter
Solomon
could
have
saved
his
son.
/
was
there,
Mal'akh
thought.
/
heard
it
all.
Mal'akh
had
never
forgotten
that
night.
Solomon's
brutal
decision
had
meant
the
end
of
his
son,
Zach,
but
it
had
been
the
birth
of
Mal'akh.
Some
must
die
that
others
may
live.
As
the
light
over
Mal'akh's
head
began
changing
color
again,
he
realized
the
hour
was
late.
He
completed
his
preparations
and
headed
back
up
the
ramp.
It
was
time
to
attend
to
matters
of
the
mortal
world.
All
is
revealed
at
the
thirty-third
degree,
Katherine
thought
as
she
ran.
/
know
how
to
transform
the
pyramid!
The
answer
had
been
right
in
front
of
them
all
night.
Katherine
and
Langdon
were
alone
now,
dashing
through
the
cathedral's
annex,
following
signs
for
"The
Garth."
Now,
exactly
as
the
dean
had
promised,
they
burst
out
of
the
cathedral
into
a
massive,
walled-in
courtyard.
The
cathedral
garth
was
a
cloistered,
pentagonal
garden
with
a
bronze
postmodern
fountain.
Katherine
was
amazed
how
loudly
the
fountain's
flowing
water
seemed
to
be
reverberating
in
the
courtyard.
Then
she
realized
it
was
not
the
fountain
she
was
hearing.
"Helicopter!"
she
shouted
as
a
beam
of
light
pierced
the
night
sky
above
them.
"Get
under
that
portico!"
The
dazzling
glare
of
a
searchlight
flooded
the
garth
just
as
Langdon
and
Katherine
reached
the
other
side,
slipping
beneath
a
Gothic
arch
into
a
tunnel
that
led
to
the
outside
lawn.
They
waited,
huddled
in
the
tunnel,
as
the
helicopter
passed
overhead
and
began
circling
the
cathedral
in
wide
arcs.
"I
guess
Galloway
was
right
about
hearing
visitors,"
Katherine
said,
impressed.
Bad
eyes
make
for
great
ears.
Her
own
ears
now
pounded
rhythmically
with
her
racing
pulse.
"This
way,"
Langdon
said,
clutching
his
daybag
and
moving
through
the
passage.
Dean
Galloway
had
given
them
a
single
key
and
a
clear
set
of
directions.
Unfortunately,
when
they
reached
the
end
of
the
short
tunnel,
they
found
themselves
separated
from
their
destination
by
a
wide-open
expanse
of
lawn,
currently
flooded
with
light
from
the
helicopter
overhead.
"We
can't
get
across,"
Katherine
said.
"Hold
on
look."
Langdon
pointed
to
a
black
shadow
that
was
materializing
on
the
lawn
to
their
left.
The
shadow
began
as
an
amorphous
blob,
but
it
was
growing
quickly,
moving
in
their
direction,
becoming
more
defined,
rushing
at
them
faster
and
faster,
stretching,
and
finally
transforming
itself
into
a
massive
black
rectangle
crowned
by
two
impossibly
tall
spires.
"The
cathedral
facade
is
blocking
the
searchlight,"
Langdon
said.
"They're
landing
out
in
front!"
Langdon
grabbed
Katherine's
hand.
"Run!
Now!"
Inside
the
cathedral,
Dean
Galloway
felt
a
lightness
in
his
step
that
he
had
not
felt
in
years.
He
moved
through
the
Great
Crossing,
down
the
nave
toward
the
narthex
and
the
front
doors.
He
could
hear
the
helicopter
hovering
in
front
of
the
cathedral
now,
and
he
imagined
its
lights
coming
through
the
rose
window
in
front
of
him,
throwing
spectacular
colors
all
over
the
sanctuary.
He
recalled
the
days
when
he
could
see
color.
Ironically,
the
lightless
void
that
had
become
his
world
had
illuminated
many
things
for
him.
/
see
more
clearly
now
than
ever.
Galloway
had
been
called
to
God
as
a
young
man
and
over
his
lifetime
had
loved
the
church
as
much
as
any
man
could.
Like
many
of
his
colleagues
who
had
given
their
lives
in
earnest
to
God,
Galloway
was
weary.
He
had
spent
his
life
straining
to
be
heard
above
the
din
of
ignorance.
What
did
I
expect?
From
the
Crusades,
to
the
Inquisition,
to
American
politics
the
name
Jesus
had
been
hijacked
as
an
ally
in
all
kinds
of
power
struggles.
Since
the
beginning
of
time,
the
ignorant
had
always
screamed
the
loudest,
herding
the
unsuspecting
masses
and
forcing
them
to
do
their
bidding.
They
defended
their
worldly
desires
by
citing
Scripture
they
did
not
understand.
They
celebrated
their
intolerance
as
proof
of
their
convictions.
Now,
after
all
these
years,
mankind
had
finally
managed
to
utterly
erode
everything
that
had
once
been
so
beautiful
about
Jesus.
Tonight,
encountering
the
symbol
of
the
Rose
Cross
had
fueled
him
with
great
hope,
reminding
him
of
the
prophecies
written
in
the
Rosicrucian
manifestos,
which
Galloway
had
read
countless
times
in
the
past
and
could
still
recall.
the
elect.
shall
be
reconciled.
suffering
of
humankind.
chalice,
which
was
filled
with
the
false
life
of
the
theological
vine.
Galloway
knew
the
church
had
long
ago
lost
her
way,
and
he
had
dedicated
his
life
to
righting
her
course.
Now,
he
realized,
the
moment
was
fast
approaching.
It
is
always
darkest
before
the
dawn.
CIA
field
agent
Turner
Simkins
was
perched
on
the
strut
of
the
Sikorsky
helicopter
as
it
touched
down
on
the
frosty
grass.
He
leaped
off,
joined
by
his
men,
and
immediately
waved
the
chopper
back
up
into
the
air
to
keep
an
eye
on
all
the
exits.
Nobody
leaves
this
building.
As
the
chopper
rose
back
into
the
night
sky,
Simkins
and
his
team
ran
up
the
stairs
to
the
cathedral's
main
entrance.
Before
he
could
decide
which
of
the
six
doors
to
pound
on,
one
of
them
swung
open.
"Yes?"
a
calm
voice
said
from
the
shadows.
Simkins
could
barely
make
out
the
hunched
figure
in
priest's
robes.
"Are
you
Dean
Colin
Galloway?"
"I
am,"
the
old
man
replied.
"I'm
looking
for
Robert
Langdon.
Have
you
seen
him?"
The
old
man
stepped
forward
now,
staring
past
Simkins
with
eerie
blank
eyes.
"Now,
wouldn't
that
be
a
miracle."
Time
is
running
out.
Security
analyst
Nola
Kaye
was
already
on
edge,
and
the
third
mug
of
coffee
she
was
now
drinking
had
begun
coursing
through
her
like
an
electric
current.
No
word
yet
from
Sato.
Finally,
her
phone
rang,
and
Nola
leaped
on
it.
"OS,"
she
answered.
"Nola
here."
"Nola,
it's
Rick
Parrish
in
systems
security."
Nola
slumped.
No
Sato.
"Hi,
Rick.
What
can
I
do
for
you?"
"I
wanted
to
give
you
a
heads-up
our
department
may
have
information
relevant
to
what
you're
working
on
tonight."
Nola
set
down
her
coffee.
How
the
hell
do
you
know
what
I'm
working
on
tonight?
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"Sorry,
it's
the
new
CI
program
we're
beta-testing,"
Parrish
said.
"It
keeps
flagging
your
workstation
number."
Nola
now
realized
what
he
was
talking
about.
The
Agency
was
currently
running
a
new
piece
of
"collaborative
integration"
software
designed
to
provide
real-time
alerts
to
disparate
CIA
departments
when
they
happened
to
be
processing
related
data
fields.
In
an
era
of
time-
sensitive
terrorist
threats,
the
key
to
thwarting
disaster
was
often
as
simple
as
a
heads-up
telling
you
that
the
guy
down
the
hall
was
analyzing
the
very
data
you
needed.
As
far
as
Nola
was
concerned,
this
CI
software
had
proven
more
of
a
distraction
than
any
real
help
constant
interruption
software,
she
called
it.
"Right,
I
forgot,"
Nola
said.
"What
have
you
got?"
She
was
positive
that
nobody
else
in
the
building
knew
about
this
crisis,
much
less
could
be
working
on
it.
The
only
computer
work
Nola
had
done
tonight
was
historical
research
for
Sato
on
esoteric
Masonic
topics.
Nonetheless,
she
was
obliged
to
play
the
game.
"Well,
it's
probably
nothing,"
Parrish
said,
"but
we
stopped
a
hacker
tonight,
and
the
CI
program
keeps
suggesting
I
share
the
information
with
you."
A
hacker?
Nola
sipped
her
coffee.
"I'm
listening."
"About
an
hour
ago,"
Parrish
said,
"we
snagged
a
guy
named
Zoubianis
trying
to
access
a
file
on
one
of
our
internal
databases.
This
guy
claims
it
was
a
job
for
hire
and
that
he
has
no
idea
why
he
was
being
paid
to
access
this
particular
file
or
even
that
it
was
on
a
CIA
server."
"Okay."
"We
finished
questioning
him,
and
he's
clean.
But
here's
the
weird
thing
the
same
file
he
was
targeting
had
been
flagged
earlier
tonight
by
an
internal
search
engine.
It
looks
like
someone
piggybacked
into
our
system,
ran
a
specific
keyword
search,
and
generated
a
redaction.
The
thing
is,
the
keywords
they
used
are
really
strange.
And
there's
one
in
particular
that
the
CI
flagged
as
a
high-priority
match
one
that's
unique
to
both
of
our
data
sets."
He
paused.
"Do
you
know
the
word
symbolonT
Nola
jolted
upright,
spilling
coffee
on
her
desk.
"The
other
keywords
are
just
as
unusual,"
Parrish
continued.
"Pyramid,
portal
"Get
down
here,"
Nola
commanded,
mopping
up
her
desk.
"And
bring
everything
you've
got!"
"These
words
actually
mean
something
to
you?"
"NOW!"
Cathedral
College
is
an
elegant,
castlelike
edifice
located
adjacent
to
the
National
Cathedral.
The
College
of
Preachers,
as
it
was
originally
envisioned
by
the
first
Episcopal
bishop
of
Washington,
was
founded
to
provide
ongoing
education
for
clergy
after
their
ordination.
Today,
the
college
offers
a
wide
variety
of
programs
on
theology,
global
justice,
healing,
and
spirituality.
Langdon
and
Katherine
had
made
the
dash
across
the
lawn
and
used
Galloway's
key
to
slip
inside
just
as
the
helicopter
rose
back
over
the
cathedral,
its
floodlights
turning
night
back
into
day.
Now,
standing
breathless
inside
the
foyer,
they
surveyed
their
surroundings.
The
windows
provided
sufficient
illumination,
and
Langdon
saw
no
reason
to
turn
the
lights
on
and
take
a
chance
of
broadcasting
their
whereabouts
to
the
helicopter
overhead.
As
they
moved
down
the
central
hallway,
they
passed
a
series
of
conference
halls,
classrooms,
and
sitting
areas.
The
interior
reminded
Langdon
of
the
neo-Gothic
buildings
of
Yale
University
breathtaking
on
the
outside,
and
yet
surprisingly
utilitarian
on
the
inside,
their
period
elegance
having
been
retrofitted
to
endure
heavy
foot
traffic.
"Down
here,"
Katherine
said,
motioning
toward
the
far
end
of
the
hall.
Katherine
had
yet
to
share
with
Langdon
her
new
revelation
regarding
the
pyramid,
but
apparently
the
reference
to
Isaacus
Neutonuus
had
sparked
it.
All
she
had
said
as
they
crossed
the
lawn
was
that
the
pyramid
could
be
transformed
using
simple
science.
Everything
she
needed,
she
believed,
could
probably
be
found
in
this
building.
Langdon
had
no
idea
what
she
needed
or
how
Katherine
intended
to
transform
a
solid
piece
of
granite
or
gold,
but
considering
he
had
just
witnessed
a
cube
metamorphose
into
a
Rosicrucian
cross,
he
was
willing
to
have
faith.
They
reached
the
end
of
the
hall
and
Katherine
frowned,
apparently
not
seeing
what
she
wanted.
"You
said
this
building
has
dormitory
facilities?"
"Yes,
for
residential
conferences."
"So
they
must
have
a
kitchen
in
here
somewhere,
right?"
"You're
hungry?"
She
frowned
back
at
him.
"No,
I
need
a
lab."
Of
course
you
do.
Langdon
spotted
a
descending
staircase
that
bore
a
promising
symbol.
America's
favorite
pictogram.
The
basement
kitchen
was
industrial
looking
lots
of
stainless
steel
and
big
bowls
clearly
designed
to
cook
for
large
groups.
The
kitchen
had
no
windows.
Katherine
closed
the
door
and
flipped
on
the
lights.
The
exhaust
fans
came
on
automatically.
She
began
rooting
around
in
the
cupboards
for
whatever
it
was
she
needed.
"Robert,"
she
directed,
"put
the
pyramid
out
on
the
island,
if
you
would."
Feeling
like
the
novice
sous
chef
taking
orders
from
Daniel
Boulud,
Langdon
did
as
he
was
told,
removing
the
pyramid
from
his
bag
and
placing
the
gold
capstone
on
top
of
it.
When
he
finished,
Katherine
was
busy
filling
an
enormous
pot
with
hot
tap
water.
"Would
you
please
lift
this
to
the
stove
for
me?"
Langdon
heaved
the
sloshing
pot
onto
the
stove
as
Katherine
turned
on
the
gas
burner
and
cranked
up
the
flame.
"Are
we
doing
lobsters?"
he
asked
hopefully.
"Very
funny.
No,
we're
doing
alchemy.
And
for
the
record,
this
is
a
pasta
pot,
not
a
lobster
pot."
She
pointed
to
the
perforated
strainer
insert
that
she
had
removed
from
the
pot
and
placed
on
the
island
beside
the
pyramid.
Silly
me.
"And
boiling
pasta
is
going
to
help
us
decipher
the
pyramid?"
Katherine
ignored
the
comment,
her
tone
turning
serious.
"As
I'm
sure
you
know,
there
is
a
historical
and
symbolic
reason
the
Masons
chose
thirty-three
as
their
highest
degree."
"Of
course,"
Langdon
said.
In
the
days
of
Pythagoras,
six
centuries
before
Christ,
the
tradition
of
numerology
hailed
the
number
33
as
the
highest
of
all
the
Master
Numbers.
It
was
the
most
sacred
figure,
symbolizing
Divine
Truth.
The
tradition
lived
on
within
the
Masons
and
elsewhere.
It
was
no
coincidence
that
Christians
were
taught
that
Jesus
was
crucified
at
age
thirty-three,
despite
no
real
historical
evidence
to
that
effect.
Nor
was
it
coincidence
that
Joseph
was
said
to
have
been
thirty-three
when
he
married
the
Virgin
Mary,
or
that
Jesus
accomplished
thirty-three
miracles,
or
that
God's
name
was
mentioned
thirty-three
times
in
Genesis,
or
that,
in
Islam,
all
the
dwellers
of
heaven
were
permanently
thirty-three
years
old.
"Thirty-three,"
Katherine
said,
"is
a
sacred
number
in
many
mystical
traditions."
"Correct."
Langdon
still
had
no
idea
what
this
had
to
do
with
a
pasta
pot.
"So
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
to
you
that
an
early
alchemist,
Rosicrucian,
and
mystic
like
Isaac
Newton
also
considered
the
number
thirty-three
special."
"I'm
sure
he
did,"
Langdon
replied.
"Newton
was
deep
into
numerology,
prophecy,
and
astrology,
but
what
does"
"All
is
revealed
at
the
thirty-third
degree."
Langdon
pulled
Peter's
ring
from
his
pocket
and
read
the
inscription.
Then
he
glanced
back
at
the
pot
of
water.
"Sorry,
you
lost
me."
"Robert,
earlier
tonight,
we
all
assumed
'thirty-third
degree'
referred
to
the
Masonic
degree,
and
yet
when
we
rotated
that
ring
thirty-three
degrees,
the
cube
transformed
and
revealed
a
cross.
At
that
moment,
we
realized
the
word
degree
was
being
used
in
another
sense."
"Yes.
Degrees
of
arc."
"Exactly.
But
degree
has
a
third
meaning
as
well."
Langdon
eyed
the
pot
of
water
on
the
stove.
"Temperature."
"Exactly!"
she
said.
"It
was
right
in
front
of
us
all
night.
'All
is
revealed
at
the
thirty-third
degree.'
If
we
bring
this
pyramid's
temperature
to
thirty-three
degrees
it
may
just
reveal
something."
Langdon
knew
Katherine
Solomon
was
exceptionally
bright,
and
yet
she
seemed
to
be
missing
a
rather
obvious
point.
"If
I'm
not
mistaken,
thirty-three
degrees
is
almost
freezing.
Shouldn't
we
be
putting
the
pyramid
in
the
freezer?"
Katherine
smiled.
"Not
if
we
want
to
follow
the
recipe
written
by
the
great
alchemist
and
Rosicrucian
mystic
who
signed
his
papers
Jeova
Sanctus
Unus."
Isaacus
Neutonuus
wrote
recipes
?
"Robert,
temperature
is
the
fundamental
alchemical
catalyst,
and
it
was
not
always
measured
in
Fahrenheit
and
Celsius.
There
are
far
older
temperature
scales,
one
of
them
invented
by
Isaac
"The
Newton
Scale!"
Langdon
said,
realizing
she
was
right.
"Yes!
Isaac
Newton
invented
an
entire
system
of
quantifying
temperature
based
entirely
on
natural
phenomena.
The
temperature
of
melting
ice
was
Newton's
base
point,
and
he
called
it
'the
zeroth
degree.'She
paused.
"I
suppose
you
can
guess
what
degree
he
assigned
the
temperature
of
boiling
water
the
king
of
all
alchemical
processes?"
"Thirty-three."
"Yes,
thirty-three!
The
thirty-third
degree.
On
the
Newton
Scale,
the
temperature
of
boiling
water
is
thirty-
three
degrees.
I
remember
asking
my
brother
once
why
Newton
chose
that
number.
I
mean,
it
seemed
so
random.
Boiling
water
is
the
most
fundamental
alchemical
process,
and
he
chose
thirty-three?
Why
not
a
hundred?
Why
not
something
more
elegant?
Peter
explained
that,
to
a
mystic
like
Isaac
Newton,
there
was
no
number
more
elegant
than
thirty
-three."
All
is
revealed
at
the
thirty-third
degree.
Langdon
glanced
at
the
pot
of
water
and
then
over
at
the
pyramid.
"Katherine,
the
pyramid
is
made
out
of
solid
granite
and
solid
gold.
Do
you
really
think
boiling
water
is
hot
enough
to
transform
it?"
The
smile
on
her
face
told
Langdon
that
Katherine
knew
something
he
did
not
know.
Confidently,
she
walked
over
to
the
island,
lifted
the
gold-capped,
granite
pyramid,
and
set
it
in
the
strainer.
Then
she
carefully
lowered
it
into
the
bubbling
water.
"Let's
find
out,
shall
we?"
High
above
the
National
Cathedral,
the
CIA
pilot
locked
the
helicopter
in
auto-hover
mode
and
surveyed
the
perimeter
of
the
building
and
the
grounds.
No
movement.
His
thermal
imaging
couldn't
penetrate
the
cathedral
stone,
and
so
he
couldn't
tell
what
the
team
was
doing
inside,
but
if
anyone
tried
to
slip
out,
the
thermal
would
pick
it
up.
It
was
sixty
seconds
later
that
a
thermal
sensor
pinged.
Working
on
the
same
principle
as
home-security
systems,
the
detector
had
identified
a
strong
temperature
differential.
Usually
this
meant
a
human
form
moving
through
a
cool
space,
but
what
appeared
on
the
monitor
was
more
of
a
thermal
cloud,
a
patch
of
hot
air
drifting
across
the
lawn.
The
pilot
found
the
source,
an
active
vent
on
the
side
of
Cathedral
College.
Probably
nothing,
he
thought.
He
saw
these
kinds
of
gradients
all
the
time.
Someone
cooking
or
doing
laundry.
As
he
was
about
to
turn
away,
though,
he
realized
something
odd.
There
were
no
cars
in
the
parking
lot
and
no
lights
on
anywhere
in
the
building.
He
studied
the
UH-60's
imaging
system
for
a
long
moment.
Then
he
radioed
down
to
his
team
leader.
"Simkins,
it's
probably
nothing,
but"
"Incandescent
temperature
indicator!"
Langdon
had
to
admit,
it
was
clever.
"It's
simple
science,"
Katherine
said.
"Different
substances
incandesce
at
different
temperatures.
We
call
them
thermal
markers.
Science
uses
these
markers
all
the
time."
Langdon
gazed
down
at
the
submerged
pyramid
and
capstone.
Wisps
of
steam
were
beginning
to
curl
over
the
bubbling
water,
although
he
was
not
feeling
hopeful.
He
glanced
at
his
watch,
and
his
heart
rate
accelerated:
11:45
P.M.
"You
believe
something
here
will
luminesce
as
it
heats
up?"
"Not
luminesce,
Robert.
Incandesce.
There's
a
big
difference.
Incandescence
is
caused
by
heat,
and
it
occurs
at
a
specific
temperature.
For
example,
when
steel
manufacturers
temper
beams,
they
spray
a
grid
on
them
with
a
transparent
coating
that
incandesces
at
a
specific
target
temperature
so
they
know
when
the
beams
are
done.
Think
of
a
mood
ring.
Just
put
it
on
your
finger,
and
it
changes
color
from
body
heat."
"Katherine,
this
pyramid
was
built
in
the
1800s!
I
can
understand
a
craftsman
making
hidden
release
hinges
in
a
stone
box,
but
applying
some
kind
of
transparent
thermal
coating?"
"Perfectly
feasible,"
she
said,
glancing
hopefully
at
the
submerged
pyramid.
"The
early
alchemists
used
organic
phosphors
all
the
time
as
thermal
markers.
The
Chinese
made
colored
fireworks,
and
even
the
Egyptians
Katherine
stopped
midsentence,
staring
intently
into
the
roiling
water.
"What?"
Langdon
followed
her
gaze
into
the
turbulent
water
but
saw
nothing
at
all.
Katherine
leaned
in,
staring
more
intently
into
the
water.
Suddenly
she
turned
and
ran
across
the
kitchen
toward
the
door.
"Where
are
you
going?"
Langdon
shouted.
She
slid
to
a
stop
at
the
kitchen
light
switch,
flipped
it
off.
The
lights
and
exhaust
fan
went
off,
plunging
the
room
into
total
darkness
and
silence.
Langdon
turned
back
to
the
pyramid
and
peered
through
the
steam
at
the
capstone
beneath
the
water.
By
the
time
Katherine
made
it
back
to
his
side,
his
mouth
had
fallen
open
in
disbelief.
Exactly
as
Katherine
had
predicted,
a
small
section
of
the
metal
capstone
was
starting
to
glow
beneath
the
water.
Letters
were
starting
to
appear,
and
they
were
getting
brighter
as
the
water
heated
up.
"Text!"
Katherine
whispered.
Langdon
nodded,
dumbstruck.
The
glowing
words
were
materializing
just
beneath
the
engraved
inscription
on
the
capstone.
It
looked
like
only
three
words,
and
although
Langdon
could
not
yet
read
what
the
words
said,
he
wondered
if
they
would
unveil
everything
they
had
been
looking
for
tonight.
The
pyramid
is
a
real
map,
Galloway
had
told
them,
and
it
points
to
a
real
location.
As
the
letters
shone
brighter,
Katherine
turned
off
the
gas,
and
the
water
slowly
stopped
churning.
The
capstone
now
came
into
focus
beneath
the
water's
calm
surface.
Three
shining
words
were
clearly
legible.
In
the
dim
light
of
the
Cathedral
College
kitchen,
Langdon
and
Katherine
stood
over
the
pot
of
water
and
stared
at
the
transformed
capstone
beneath
the
surface.
On
the
side
of
the
golden
capstone,
an
incandescent
message
was
glowing.
Langdon
read
the
shining
text,
scarcely
able
to
believe
his
eyes.
He
knew
the
pyramid
was
rumored
to
reveal
a
specific
location
but
he
had
never
imagined
that
the
location
would
be
quite
this
specific.
Eight
Franklin
Square
"A
street
address,"
he
whispered,
stunned.
Katherine
looked
equally
amazed.
"I
don't
know
what's
there,
do
you?"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
He
knew
Franklin
Square
was
one
of
the
older
sections
of
Washington,
but
he
wasn't
familiar
with
the
address.
He
looked
at
the
tip
of
the
capstone,
and
read
downward,
taking
in
the
entire
text.
The
secret
hides
within
The
Order
Eight
Franklin
Square
Is
there
some
kind
of
Order
on
Franklin
Square?
Is
there
a
building
that
hides
the
opening
to
a
deep
spiral
staircase?
Whether
or
not
there
was
actually
something
buried
at
that
address,
Langdon
had
no
idea.
The
important
issue
at
this
point
was
that
he
and
Katherine
had
deciphered
the
pyramid
and
now
possessed
the
information
required
to
negotiate
Peter's
release.
And
not
a
moment
too
soon.
The
glowing
arms
on
Langdon's
Mickey
Mouse
watch
indicated
that
they
had
less
than
ten
minutes
to
spare.
"Make
the
call,"
Katherine
said,
motioning
to
a
phone
on
the
wall
in
the
kitchen.
"Now!"
The
sudden
arrival
of
this
moment
startled
Langdon,
and
he
found
himself
hesitating.
"Are
we
sure
about
this?"
"I
most
certainly
am."
"I'm
not
telling
him
anything
until
we
know
Peter
is
safe."
"Of
course
not.
You
remember
the
number,
right?"
Langdon
nodded
and
made
his
way
over
to
the
kitchen
phone.
He
lifted
the
receiver
and
dialed
the
man's
cell-phone
number.
Katherine
came
over
and
placed
her
head
next
to
his
so
she
could
listen
in.
As
the
line
began
to
ring,
Langdon
prepared
himself
for
the
eerie
whisper
of
the
man
who
had
tricked
him
earlier
tonight.
Finally,
the
call
connected.
There
was
no
greeting,
though.
No
voice.
Only
the
sound
of
breathing
at
the
other
end.
Langdon
waited
and
then
finally
spoke.
"I
have
the
information
you
want,
but
if
you
want
it,
you'll
have
to
give
us
Peter."
"Who
is
this?"
a
woman's
voice
replied.
Langdon
jumped.
"Robert
Langdon,"
he
said
reflexively.
"Who
are
youT
For
an
instant
he
thought
he
must
have
dialed
incorrectly.
"Your
name
is
Langdon?"
The
woman
sounded
surprised.
"There's
someone
here
asking
for
you."
What?
"I'm
sorry,
who
is
this?"
"Officer
Paige
Montgomery
with
Preferred
Security."
Her
voice
seemed
shaky.
"Maybe
you
can
help
us
with
this.
About
an
hour
ago,
my
partner
responded
to
a
91
1
call
in
Kalorama
Heights
a
possible
hostage
situation.
I
lost
all
contact
with
her,
and
so
I
called
backup
and
came
to
check
the
residence.
We
found
my
partner
dead
in
the
backyard.
The
home
owner
was
gone,
and
so
we
broke
in.
A
cell
phone
was
ringing
on
the
hall
table,
and
I"
"You're
inside?"
Langdon
demanded.
"Yes,
and
the
91
1
tip
was
a
good
one,"
the
woman
stammered.
"Sorry
if
I
sound
rattled,
but
my
partner's
dead,
and
we
found
a
man
being
held
here
against
his
will.
He's
in
bad
shape,
and
we're
working
on
him
now.
He's
been
asking
for
two
people
one
named
Langdon
and
one
named
Katherine."
"That's
my
brother!"
Katherine
blurted
into
the
receiver,
pressing
her
head
closer
to
Langdon's.
"I
made
the
911
call!
Is
he
okay?!"
"Actually,
ma'am,
he's"
The
woman's
voice
cracked.
"He's
in
bad
shape.
He's
missing
his
right
hand
.
.
95
"Please,"
Katherine
urged.
"I
want
to
talk
to
him!"
"They're
working
on
him
at
the
moment.
He's
in
and
out
of
consciousness.
If
you're
anywhere
in
the
area,
you
should
get
over
here.
He
obviously
wants
to
see
you."
"We're
about
six
minutes
away!"
Katherine
said.
"Then
I
suggest
you
hurry."
There
was
a
muffled
noise
in
the
background,
and
the
woman
then
returned
to
the
line.
"Sorry,
it
looks
like
I'm
needed.
I'll
speak
to
you
when
you
arrive."
The
line
went
dead.
Inside
Cathedral
College,
Langdon
and
Katherine
bounded
up
the
basement
stairs
and
hurried
down
a
darkened
hallway
looking
for
a
front
exit.
No
longer
did
they
hear
the
sounds
of
helicopter
blades
overhead,
and
Langdon
felt
hopeful
they
could
slip
out
unseen
and
find
their
way
up
to
Kalorama
Heights
to
see
Peter.
They
found
him.
He's
alive.
Thirty
seconds
earlier,
when
they'd
hung
up
with
the
female
security
guard,
Katherine
had
hurriedly
hoisted
the
steaming
pyramid
and
capstone
out
of
the
water.
The
pyramid
was
still
dripping
when
she
lowered
it
into
Langdon'
s
leather
bag.
Now
he
could
feel
the
heat
radiating
through
the
leather.
Excitement
over
Peter's
discovery
had
temporarily
trumped
any
further
reflection
on
the
capstone's
glowing
message
Eight
Franklin
Square
but
there
would
be
time
for
that
once
they
got
to
Peter.
As
they
rounded
the
corner
at
the
top
of
the
stairs,
Katherine
stopped
short
and
pointed
into
a
sitting
room
across
the
hall.
Through
the
bay
window,
Langdon
could
see
a
sleek
black
helicopter
sitting
silent
on
the
lawn.
A
lone
pilot
stood
beside
it,
facing
away
from
them
and
talking
on
his
radio.
There
was
also
a
black
Escalade
with
tinted
windows
parked
nearby.
Staying
in
the
shadows,
Langdon
and
Katherine
moved
into
the
sitting
room,
and
peered
out
the
window
to
see
if
they
could
see
the
rest
of
the
field
team.
Thankfully,
the
huge
lawn
outside
the
National
Cathedral
was
empty.
"They
must
be
inside
the
cathedral,"
Langdon
said.
"They're
not,"
a
deep
voice
said
behind
them.
Langdon
and
Katherine
wheeled
around
to
see
who
had
spoken.
In
the
doorway
of
the
sitting
room,
two
black-clad
figures
aimed
laser-
sighted
rifles
at
them.
Langdon
could
see
a
glowing
red
dot
dancing
on
his
chest.
"Nice
to
see
you
again,
Professor,"
said
a
familiar
raspy
voice.
The
agents
parted,
and
the
tiny
form
of
Director
Sato
sliced
effortlessly
through,
crossing
the
sitting
room
and
stopping
directly
in
front
of
Langdon.
"You've
made
some
exceedingly
poor
choices
tonight."
"The
police
found
Peter
Solomon,"
Langdon
declared
forcefully.
"He's
in
bad
shape,
but
he'll
live.
It's
over."
If
Sato
was
surprised
Peter
had
been
found,
she
did
not
show
it.
Her
eyes
were
unflinching
as
she
walked
to
Langdon
and
stopped
only
inches
away.
"Professor,
I
can
assure
you,
this
is
nowhere
near
over.
And
if
the
police
are
now
involved,
it
has
only
become
more
serious.
As
I
told
you
earlier
this
evening,
this
is
an
extremely
delicate
situation.
You
never
should
have
run
away
with
that
pyramid."
"Ma'am,"
Katherine
blurted,
"I
need
to
see
my
brother.
You
can
have
the
pyramid,
but
you
must
let
"I
mustT
Sato
demanded,
spinning
to
Katherine.
"Ms.
Solomon,
I
assume?"
She
stared
at
Katherine
with
fire
in
her
eyes
and
then
turned
back
to
Langdon.
"Put
the
leather
bag
on
the
table."
Langdon
glanced
down
at
the
pair
of
laser
sights
on
his
chest.
He
set
the
leather
bag
on
the
coffee
table.
An
agent
approached
cautiously,
unzipped
the
bag,
and
pulled
the
two
sides
apart.
A
little
puff
of
trapped
steam
billowed
up
out
of
the
bag.
He
aimed
his
light
inside,
stared
for
a
long,
puzzled
moment,
and
then
nodded
to
Sato.
Sato
walked
over
and
peered
into
the
bag.
The
wet
pyramid
and
capstone
glistened
in
the
beam
of
the
flashlight.
Sato
crouched
down,
looking
very
closely
at
the
golden
capstone,
which
Langdon
realized
she
had
only
seen
in
X-ray.
"The
inscription,"
Sato
demanded.
"Does
it
mean
anything
to
you?
'The
secret
hides
within
The
Order'?"
"We're
not
sure,
ma'am."
"Why
is
the
pyramid
steaming
hot?"
"We
submerged
it
in
boiling
water,"
Katherine
said
without
hesitation.
"It
was
part
of
the
process
of
deciphering
the
code.
We'll
tell
you
everything,
but
please
let
us
go
see
my
brother.
He's
been
through
"You
boiled
the
pyramid?"
Sato
demanded.
"Turn
off
the
flashlight,"
Katherine
said.
"Look
at
the
capstone.
You
can
probably
still
see."
The
agent
flicked
off
his
light,
and
Sato
knelt
down
before
the
capstone.
Even
from
where
Langdon
was
standing,
he
could
see
that
the
text
on
the
capstone
was
still
glowing
slightly.
"Eight
Franklin
Square?"
Sato
said,
sounding
amazed.
"Yes,
ma'am.
That
text
was
written
with
an
incandescent
lacquer
or
something.
The
thirty-third
degree
was
actually
"And
the
address?"
Sato
demanded.
"Is
this
what
this
guy
wants?"
"Yes,"
Langdon
said.
"He
believes
the
pyramid
is
a
map
that
will
tell
him
the
location
of
a
great
treasure
the
key
to
unlocking
the
Ancient
Mysteries."
Sato
looked
again
at
the
capstone,
her
expression
one
of
disbelief.
"Tell
me,"
she
said,
fear
creeping
into
her
voice,
"have
you
contacted
this
man
yet?
Have
you
already
given
him
this
address?"
"We
tried."
Langdon
explained
what
had
happened
when
they
called
the
man's
cell
phone.
Sato
listened,
running
her
tongue
over
her
yellow
teeth
as
he
spoke.
Despite
looking
ready
to
erupt
with
anger
over
the
situation,
she
turned
to
one
of
her
agents
and
spoke
in
a
restrained
whisper.
"Send
him
in.
He's
in
the
SUV."
The
agent
nodded
and
spoke
into
his
transceiver.
"Send
who
in?"
Langdon
said.
"The
only
person
who
has
any
hope
of
fixing
the
goddamn
mess
you
made!"
"What
mess?"
Langdon
fired
back.
"Now
that
Peter
is
safe,
everything
is
"For
Christ's
sake!"
Sato
exploded.
"This
is
not
about
Peter!
I
tried
to
tell
you
that
at
the
Capitol
Building,
Professor,
but
you
chose
to
work
against
me
rather
than
with
me!
Now
you've
made
an
ungodly
mess!
When
you
destroyed
your
cell
phone,
which,
by
the
way,
we
were
tracking,
you
cut
off
your
communication
with
this
man.
And
this
address
you
uncovered
whatever
the
hell
it
is
this
address
was
our
one
chance
to
catch
this
lunatic.
I
needed
you
to
play
his
game,
to
provide
him
with
this
address
so
we
would
know
where
the
hell
to
catch
him!"
Before
Langdon
could
reply,
Sato
directed
the
remainder
of
her
wrath
at
Katherine.
"And
you,
Ms.
Solomon!
You
knew
where
this
maniac
lived?
Why
didn't
you
tell
me?
You
sent
a
rent-a-cop
to
this
man's
house?
Don't
you
see
you've
ruined
any
chance
we
had
of
catching
him
there?
I'm
glad
your
brother
is
safe,
but
let
me
tell
you
this,
we
are
facing
a
crisis
tonight
whose
ramifications
far
outreach
your
family.
They
will
be
felt
all
around
the
world.
The
man
who
took
your
brother
has
enormous
power,
and
we
need
to
catch
him
immediately."
As
she
finished
her
tirade,
the
tall,
elegant
silhouette
of
Warren
Bellamy
emerged
from
the
shadows
and
stepped
into
the
sitting
room.
He
looked
rumpled,
bruised,
and
shaken
like
he'd
been
through
hell.
"Warren!"
Langdon
stood
up.
"Are
you
okay?"
"No,"
he
replied.
"Not
really."
"Did
you
hear?
Peter
is
safe!"
Bellamy
nodded,
looking
dazed,
as
if
nothing
mattered
anymore.
"Yes,
I
just
heard
your
conversation.
I'm
glad."
"Warren,
what
the
hell
is
going
on?"
Sato
intervened.
"You
boys
can
catch
up
in
a
minute.
Right
now,
Mr.
Bellamy
is
going
to
reach
out
to
this
lunatic
and
communicate
with
him.
Just
like
he's
been
doing
all
night."
Langdon
felt
lost.
"Bellamy
hasn't
been
communicating
with
this
guy
tonight!
This
guy
doesn't
even
know
Bellamy
is
involved!"
Sato
turned
to
Bellamy
and
raised
her
eyebrows.
Bellamy
sighed.
"Robert,
I'm
afraid
I
haven't
been
entirely
honest
with
you
this
evening."
Langdon
could
only
stare.
"I
thought
I
was
doing
the
right
thing"
Bellamy
said,
looking
frightened.
"Well,"
Sato
said,
"now
you
will
do
the
right
thing
and
we'd
all
better
pray
to
God
it
works."
As
if
to
substantiate
Sato's
portentous
tone,
the
mantel
clock
began
chiming
the
hour.
Sato
took
out
a
Ziploc
bag
of
items
and
tossed
it
to
Bellamy.
"Here's
your
stuff.
Does
your
cell
phone
take
photos?"
"Yes,
ma'am."
"Good.
Hold
up
the
capstone."
The
message
Mal'akh
had
just
received
was
from
his
contact
Warren
Bellamy
the
Mason
he
had
sent
to
the
Capitol
Building
earlier
tonight
to
assist
Robert
Langdon.
Bellamy,
like
Langdon,
wanted
Peter
Solomon
back
alive
and
had
assured
Mal'akh
he
would
help
Langdon
acquire
and
decipher
the
pyramid.
All
night,
Mal'akh
had
been
receiving
e-mail
updates,
which
had
been
automatically
forwarded
to
his
cell
phone.
This
should
be
interesting,
Mal'akh
thought,
opening
the
message.
From:
Warren
Bellamy
got
separated
from
langdon
but
finally
have
info
you
demanded,
proof
attached,
call
for
missing
piece.
wb
one
attachment
(jpeg)
Call
for
missing
piece?
Mal'akh
wondered,
opening
the
attachment.
The
attachment
was
a
photo.
When
Mal'akh
saw
it,
he
gasped
out
loud,
and
he
could
feel
his
heart
start
pounding
with
excitement.
He
was
looking
at
a
close-up
of
a
tiny
golden
pyramid.
The
legendary
capstone!
The
ornate
engraving
on
the
face
carried
a
promising
message:
The
secret
hides
within
The
Order.
Beneath
the
inscription,
Mal'akh
now
saw
something
that
stunned
him.
The
capstone
seemed
to
be
glowing.
In
disbelief,
he
stared
at
the
faintly
radiant
text
and
realized
that
the
legend
was
literally
true:
The
Masonic
Pyramid
transforms
itself
to
reveal
its
secret
to
the
worthy.
How
this
magical
transformation
had
occurred,
Mal'akh
had
no
idea,
and
he
didn't
care.
The
glowing
text
was
clearly
pointing
to
a
specific
location
in
D.C.,
exactly
as
prophesied.
Franklin
Square.
Unfortunately,
the
photo
of
the
capstone
also
included
Warren
Bellamy's
index
finger,
which
was
strategically
positioned
on
the
capstone
to
block
out
a
critical
piece
of
information.
The
secret
hides
within
The
Order
Franklin
Square
Call
for
missing
piece.
Mal'akh
now
understood
Bellamy's
meaning.
The
Architect
of
the
Capitol
had
been
cooperative
all
night,
but
now
he
had
chosen
to
play
a
very
dangerous
game.
Beneath
the
watchful
gaze
of
several
armed
CIA
agents,
Langdon,
Katherine,
and
Bellamy
waited
with
Sato
in
the
Cathedral
College
sitting
room.
On
the
coffee
table
before
them,
Langdon'
s
leather
bag
was
still
open,
the
golden
capstone
peeking
out
the
top.
The
words
Eight
Franklin
Square
had
now
faded
away,
leaving
no
evidence
that
they
had
ever
existed.
Katherine
had
pleaded
with
Sato
to
let
her
go
see
her
brother,
but
Sato
had
simply
shaken
her
head,
eyes
fixed
on
Bellamy's
cell
phone.
It
sat
on
the
coffee
table
and
had
yet
to
ring.
Why
didn't
Bellamy
just
tell
me
the
truth?
Langdon
wondered.
Apparently,
the
Architect
had
been
in
contact
with
Peter's
captor
all
night,
reassuring
him
that
Langdon
was
making
progress
deciphering
the
pyramid.
It
was
a
bluff,
an
attempt
to
buy
time
for
Peter.
In
fact,
Bellamy
was
doing
all
he
could
to
interfere
with
anyone
who
threatened
to
unveil
the
pyramid's
secret.
Now,
however,
it
seemed
that
Bellamy
had
switched
sides.
He
and
Sato
were
now
prepared
to
risk
the
pyramid's
secret
in
hopes
of
catching
this
man.
"Take
your
hands
off
me!"
shouted
an
elderly
voice
in
the
hall.
"I'm
blind,
not
inept!
I
know
my
way
through
the
college!"
Dean
Galloway
was
still
protesting
loudly
as
a
CIA
agent
manhandled
him
into
the
sitting
room
and
forced
him
into
one
of
the
chairs.
"Who's
here?"
Galloway
demanded,
his
blank
eyes
staring
dead
ahead.
"It
sounds
like
a
lot
of
you.
How
many
do
you
need
to
detain
an
old
man?
Really
now!"
"There
are
seven
of
us,"
Sato
declared.
"Including
Robert
Langdon,
Katherine
Solomon,
and
your
Masonic
brother
Warren
Bellamy."
Galloway
slumped,
all
his
bluster
gone.
"We're
okay,"
Langdon
said.
"And
we
just
heard
that
Peter
is
safe.
He's
in
bad
shape,
but
the
police
are
with
him."
"Thank
heavens,"
Galloway
said.
"And
the
A
loud
rattling
caused
everyone
in
the
room
to
jump.
It
was
Bellamy's
cell
phone
vibrating
against
the
coffee
table.
Everyone
fell
silent.
"Okay,
Mr.
Bellamy,"
Sato
said.
"Don't
blow
it.
You
know
the
stakes."
Bellamy
took
a
deep
breath
and
exhaled.
Then
he
reached
down
and
pressed
the
speakerphone
button
to
connect
the
call.
"Bellamy
here,"
he
said,
speaking
loudly
toward
the
phone
on
the
coffee
table.
The
voice
that
crackled
back
through
the
speaker
was
familiar,
an
airy
whisper.
It
sounded
like
he
was
calling
from
a
hands-free
speakerphone
inside
a
car.
"It's
past
midnight,
Mr.
Bellamy.
I
was
about
to
put
Peter
out
of
his
misery."
There
was
an
uneasy
silence
in
the
room.
"Let
me
talk
to
him."
"Impossible,"
the
man
replied.
"We're
driving.
He's
tied
up
in
the
trunk."
Langdon
and
Katherine
exchanged
looks
and
then
began
shaking
their
heads
at
everyone.
He
's
bluffing!
He
no
longer
has
Peter!
Sato
motioned
for
Bellamy
to
keep
pressing.
"I
want
proof
thai
Peter's
alive,"
Bellamy
said.
"I'm
not
giving
you
the
rest
of
"Your
Worshipful
Master
needs
a
doctor.
Don't
waste
time
with
negotiations.
Tell
me
the
street
number
on
Franklin
Square,
and
I'll
bring
Peter
to
you
there."
"I
told
you,
I
want"
"Now!"
the
man
exploded.
"Or
I
will
pull
over
and
Peter
Solomon
dies
this
instant!"
"You
listen
to
me,"
Bellamy
said
forcefully.
"If
you
want
the
rest
of
the
address,
you'll
play
by
my
rules.
Meet
me
at
Franklin
Square.
Once
you
deliver
Peter
alive,
I'll
tell
you
the
number
of
the
building."
"How
do
I
know
you
won't
bring
the
authorities?"
"Because
I
can't
risk
double-crossing
you.
Peter's
life
is
not
the
only
card
you
hold.
I
know
what's
really
at
stake
tonight."
"You
do
realize,"
the
man
on
the
phone
said,
"that
if
I
sense
so
much
as
a
hint
of
anyone
other
than
you
at
Franklin
Square,
I
will
keep
driving,
and
you
will
never
find
even
a
trace
of
Peter
Solomon.
And
of
course
.
.
.
that
will
be
the
least
of
your
worries."
"I'll
come
alone,"
Bellamy
replied
somberly.
"When
you
turn
over
Peter,
I'll
give
you
everything
you
need."
"Center
of
the
square,"
the
man
said.
"It
will
take
me
at
least
twenty
minutes
to
get
there.
I
suggest
you
wait
for
me
as
long
as
it
takes."
The
line
went
dead.
Instantly,
the
room
sprang
to
life.
Sato
began
shouting
orders.
Several
field
agents
grabbed
their
radios
and
headed
for
the
door.
"Move!
Move!"
In
the
chaos,
Langdon
looked
to
Bellamy
for
some
kind
of
explanation
as
to
what
was
actually
going
on
tonight,
but
the
older
man
was
already
being
hurried
out
the
door.
"I
need
to
see
my
brother!"
Katherine
shouted.
"You
have
to
let
us
go!"
Sato
walked
over
to
Katherine.
"I
don't
have
to
do
anything,
Ms.
Solomon.
Is
that
clear?"
Katherine
stood
her
ground
and
looked
desperately
into
Sato's
small
eyes.
"Ms.
Solomon,
my
top
priority
is
apprehending
the
man
at
Franklin
Square,
and
you
will
sit
here
with
one
of
my
men
until
I
accomplish
that
task.
Then,
and
only
then,
will
we
deal
with
your
brother."
"You're
missing
the
point,"
Katherine
said.
"I
know
exactly
where
this
man
lives!
It's
literally
five
minutes
up
the
road
in
Kalorama
Heights,
and
there
will
be
evidence
there
that
will
help
you!
Besides,
you
said
you
want
to
keep
this
quiet.
Who
knows
what
Peter
will
start
telling
the
authorities
once
he's
stabilized."
Sato
pursed
her
lips,
apparently
registering
Katherine'
s
point.
Outside,
the
chopper
blades
began
winding
up.
Sato
frowned
and
then
turned
to
one
of
her
men.
"Hartmann,
you
take
the
Escalade.
Transport
Ms.
Solomon
and
Mr.
Langdon
to
Kalorama
Heights.
Peter
Solomon
is
not
to
speak
to
anyone.
Is
that
understood?"
"Yes,
ma'am,"
the
agent
said.
"Call
me
when
you
get
there.
Tell
me
what
you
find.
And
don't
let
these
two
out
of
your
sight."
Agent
Hartmann
gave
a
quick
nod,
pulled
out
the
Escalade
keys,
and
headed
for
the
door.
Katherine
was
right
behind
him.
Sato
turned
to
Langdon.
"I'll
see
you
shortly,
Professor.
I
know
you
think
I'm
the
enemy,
but
I
can
assure
you
that's
not
the
case.
Get
to
Peter
at
once.
This
isn't
over
yet."
Off
to
one
side
of
Langdon,
Dean
Galloway
was
sitting
quietly
at
the
coffee
table.
His
hands
had
found
the
stone
pyramid,
which
was
still
sitting
in
Langdon'
s
open
leather
bag
on
the
table
in
front
of
him.
The
old
man
was
running
his
hands
over
the
stone's
warm
surface.
Langdon
said,
"Father,
are
you
coming
to
see
Peter?"
"I'd
just
slow
you
down."
Galloway
removed
his
hands
from
the
bag
and
zipped
it
up
around
the
pyramid.
"I'll
stay
right
here
and
pray
for
Peter's
recovery.
We
can
all
speak
later.
But
when
you
show
Peter
the
pyramid,
would
you
please
tell
him
something
for
me?"
"Of
course."
Langdon
hoisted
the
bag
onto
his
shoulder.
"Tell
him
this."
Galloway
cleared
his
throat.
"The
Masonic
Pyramid
has
always
kept
her
secret
sincerely."
"I
don't
understand."
The
old
man
winked.
"Just
tell
Peter
that.
He
will
understand."
With
that,
Dean
Galloway
bowed
his
head
and
began
praying.
Perplexed,
Langdon
left
him
there
and
hurried
outside.
Katherine
was
already
in
the
front
seat
of
the
SUV
giving
the
agent
directions.
Langdon
climbed
in
back
and
had
barely
closed
the
door
before
the
giant
vehicle
was
rocketing
across
the
lawn,
racing
northward
to
Kalorama
Heights.
Franklin
Square
is
located
in
the
northwest
quadrant
of
downtown
Washington,
bordered
by
K
and
Thirteenth
streets.
It
is
home
to
many
historic
buildings,
most
notably
the
Franklin
School,
from
which
Alexander
Graham
Bell
sent
the
world's
first
wireless
message
in
1880.
High
above
the
square,
a
fast-moving
UH-60
helicopter
approached
from
the
west,
having
completed
its
journey
from
the
National
Cathedral
in
a
matter
of
minutes.
Plenty
of
time,
Sato
thought,
peering
down
at
the
square
below.
She
knew
it
was
critical
that
her
men
got
into
position
undetected
before
their
target
arrived.
He
said
he
wouldn
't
be
here
for
at
least
twenty
minutes.
On
Sato's
command,
the
pilot
performed
a
"touch-hover"
on
the
roof
of
the
tallest
building
around
the
renowned
One
Franklin
Square
a
towering
and
prestigious
office
building
with
two
gold
spires
on
top.
The
maneuver
was
illegal,
of
course,
but
the
chopper
was
there
only
a
few
seconds,
and
its
skids
barely
touched
the
gravel
rooftop.
Once
everyone
had
jumped
out,
the
pilot
immediately
lifted
off,
banking
to
the
east,
where
he
would
climb
to
"silent
altitude"
and
provide
invisible
support
from
above.
Sato
waited
as
her
field
team
collected
their
things
and
prepared
Bellamy
for
his
task.
The
Architect
was
still
looking
dazed
from
having
seen
the
file
on
Sato's
secure
laptop.
As
I
said
an
issue
of
national
security.
Bellamy
had
quickly
understood
Sato's
meaning
and
was
now
fully
cooperative.
"All
set,
ma'am,"
Agent
Simkins
said.
On
Sato's
command,
the
agents
ushered
Bellamy
across
the
rooftop
and
disappeared
down
a
stairwell,
heading
for
ground
level
to
take
up
their
positions.
Sato
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
building
and
gazed
down.
The
rectangular
wooded
park
below
filled
the
entire
block.
Plenty
of
cover.
Sato's
team
fully
understood
the
importance
of
making
an
undetected
intercept.
If
their
target
sensed
a
presence
here
and
decided
just
to
slip
away
the
director
didn't
even
want
to
think
about
it.
The
wind
up
here
was
gusty
and
cold.
Sato
wrapped
her
arms
around
herself,
and
planted
her
feet
firmly
to
avoid
getting
blown
over
the
edge.
From
this
high
vantage
point,
Franklin
Square
looked
smaller
than
she
recalled,
with
fewer
buildings.
She
wondered
which
building
was
Eight
Franklin
Square.
This
was
information
she
had
requested
from
her
analyst
Nola,
from
whom
she
expected
word
at
any
moment.
Bellamy
and
the
agents
now
appeared,
looking
like
ants
fanning
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
wooded
area.
Simkins
positioned
Bellamy
in
a
clearing
near
the
center
of
the
deserted
park.
Then
Simkins
and
his
team
melted
into
the
natural
cover,
disappearing
from
view.
Within
seconds,
Bellamy
was
alone,
pacing
and
shivering
in
the
light
of
a
streetlamp
near
the
center
of
the
park.
Sato
felt
no
pity.
She
lit
a
cigarette
and
took
a
long
drag,
savoring
the
warmth
as
it
permeated
her
lungs.
Satisfied
that
everything
below
was
in
order,
she
stepped
back
from
the
edge
to
await
her
two
phone
calls
one
from
her
analyst
Nola
and
one
from
Agent
Hartmann,
whom
she
had
sent
to
Kalorama
Heights.
Slow
down!
Langdon
gripped
the
backseat
of
the
Escalade
as
it
flew
around
a
corner,
threatening
to
tip
up
on
two
tires.
CIA
agent
Hartmann
was
either
eager
to
show
off
his
driving
skills
to
Katherine,
or
he
had
orders
to
get
to
Peter
Solomon
before
Solomon
recuperated
enough
to
say
anything
he
shouldn't
say
to
the
local
authorities.
The
high-speed
game
of
beat-the
-red-light
on
Embassy
Row
had
been
worrisome
enough,
but
now
they
were
racing
through
the
winding
residential
neighborhood
of
Kalorama
Heights.
Katherine
shouted
directions
as
they
went,
having
been
to
this
man's
house
earlier
that
afternoon.
With
every
turn,
the
leather
bag
at
Langdon'
s
feet
rocked
back
and
forth,
and
Langdon
could
hear
the
clank
of
the
capstone,
which
had
clearly
been
jarred
from
the
top
of
the
pyramid
and
was
now
bouncing
around
in
the
bottom
of
his
bag.
Fearing
it
might
get
damaged,
he
fished
around
inside
until
he
found
it.
It
was
still
warm,
but
the
glowing
text
had
now
faded
and
disappeared,
returning
to
its
original
engraving:
The
secret
hides
within
The
Order.
As
Langdon
was
about
to
place
the
capstone
in
a
side
pocket,
he
noticed
its
elegant
surface
was
covered
with
tiny
white
gobs
of
something.
Puzzled,
he
tried
to
wipe
them
off,
but
they
were
stuck
on
and
hard
to
the
touch
like
plastic.
What
in
the
world?
He
could
now
see
that
the
surface
of
the
stone
pyramid
itself
was
also
covered
with
the
little
white
dots.
Langdon
used
his
fingernail
and
picked
one
off,
rolling
it
between
his
fingers.
"Wax?"
he
blurted.
Katherine
glanced
over
her
shoulder.
"What?"
"There
are
bits
of
wax
all
over
the
pyramid
and
capstone.
I
don't
understand
it.
Where
could
that
possibly
have
come
from?"
"Something
in
your
bag,
maybe?"
"I
don't
think
so."
As
they
rounded
a
corner,
Katherine
pointed
through
the
windshield
and
turned
to
Agent
Hartmann.
"That's
it!
We're
here."
Langdon
glanced
up
and
saw
the
spinning
lights
of
a
security
vehicle
parked
in
a
driveway
up
ahead.
The
driveway
gate
was
pulled
aside
and
the
agent
gunned
the
SUV
inside
the
compound.
The
house
was
a
spectacular
mansion.
Every
light
inside
was
ablaze,
and
the
front
door
was
wide
open.
A
half-dozen
vehicles
were
parked
haphazardly
in
the
driveway
and
on
the
lawn,
apparently
having
arrived
in
a
hurry.
Some
of
the
cars
were
still
running
and
had
their
headlights
shining,
most
on
the
house,
but
one
askew,
practically
blinding
them
as
they
drove
in.
Agent
Hartmann
skidded
to
a
stop
on
the
lawn
beside
a
white
sedan
with
a
brightly
colored
decal:
PREFERRED
SECURITY.
The
spinning
lights
and
the
high
beams
in
their
face
made
it
hard
to
see.
Katherine
immediately
jumped
out
and
raced
for
the
house.
Langdon
heaved
his
bag
onto
his
shoulder
without
taking
the
time
to
zip
it
up.
He
followed
Katherine
at
a
jog
across
the
lawn
toward
the
open
front
door.
The
sounds
of
voices
echoed
within.
Behind
Langdon,
the
SUV
chirped
as
Agent
Hartmann
locked
the
vehicle
and
hurried
after
them.
Katherine
bounded
up
the
porch
stairs,
through
the
main
door,
and
disappeared
into
the
entryway.
Langdon
crossed
the
threshold
behind
her
and
could
see
Katherine
was
already
moving
across
the
foyer
and
down
the
main
hallway
toward
the
sound
of
voices.
Beyond
her,
visible
at
the
end
of
the
hall,
was
a
dining-room
table
where
a
woman
in
a
security
uniform
was
sitting
with
her
back
to
them.
"Officer!"
Katherine
shouted
as
she
ran.
"Where
is
Peter
Solomon?"
Langdon
rushed
after
her,
but
as
he
did
so,
an
unexpected
movement
caught
his
eye.
To
his
left,
through
the
living-room
window,
he
could
see
the
driveway
gate
was
now
swinging
shut.
Odd.
Something
else
caught
his
eye
something
that
had
been
hidden
from
him
by
the
glare
of
the
spinning
lights
and
the
blinding
high
beams
when
they
drove
in.
The
half-dozen
cars
parked
haphazardly
in
the
driveway
looked
nothing
like
the
police
cars
and
emergency
vehicles
Langdon
had
imagined
they
were.
A
Mercedes?
a
Hummer?
a
Tesla
Roadster?
In
that
instant,
Langdon
also
realized
the
voices
he
heard
in
the
house
were
nothing
but
a
television
blaring
in
the
direction
of
the
dining
room.
Wheeling
in
slow
motion,
Langdon
shouted
down
the
hallway.
"Katherine,
wait!"
But
as
he
turned,
he
could
see
that
Katherine
Solomon
was
no
longer
running.
She
was
airborne.
Katherine
Solomon
knew
she
was
falling
but
she
couldn't
figure
out
why.
She
had
been
running
down
the
hall
toward
the
security
guard
in
the
dining
room
when
suddenly
her
feet
had
become
entangled
in
an
invisible
obstacle,
and
her
entire
body
had
lurched
forward,
sailing
through
the
air.
Now
she
was
returning
to
earth
in
this
case,
a
hardwood
floor.
Katherine
crashed
down
on
her
stomach,
the
wind
driven
violently
from
her
lungs.
Above
her,
a
heavy
coat
tree
teetered
precariously
and
then
toppled
over,
barely
missing
her
on
the
floor.
She
raised
her
head,
still
gasping
for
breath,
puzzled
to
see
that
the
female
security
guard
in
the
chair
had
not
moved
a
muscle.
Stranger
still,
the
toppled
coat
tree
appeared
to
have
a
thin
wire
attached
to
the
bottom,
which
had
been
stretched
across
the
hallway.
Why
in
the
world
would
someone
?
"Katherine!"
Langdon
was
shouting
to
her,
and
as
Katherine
rolled
onto
her
side
and
looked
back
at
him,
she
felt
her
blood
turn
to
ice.
Robert!
Behind
you!
She
tried
to
scream,
but
she
was
still
gasping
for
breath.
All
she
could
do
was
watch
in
terrifying
slow
motion
as
Langdon
rushed
down
the
hall
to
help
her,
completely
unaware
that
behind
him,
Agent
Hartmann
was
staggering
across
the
threshold
and
clutching
his
throat.
Blood
sprayed
through
Hartmann'
s
hands
as
he
groped
at
the
handle
of
a
long
screwdriver
that
protruded
from
his
neck.
As
the
agent
pitched
forward,
his
attacker
came
into
full
view.
My
God
no!
Naked
except
for
a
strange
undergarment
that
looked
like
a
loincloth,
the
massive
man
had
apparently
been
hiding
in
the
foyer.
His
muscular
body
was
covered
from
head
to
toe
with
strange
tattoos.
The
front
door
was
swinging
closed,
and
he
was
rushing
down
the
hall
after
Langdon.
Agent
Hartmann
hit
the
floor
just
as
the
front
door
slammed
shut.
Langdon
looked
startled
and
whirled
around,
but
the
tattooed
man
was
already
on
him,
thrusting
some
kind
of
device
into
his
back.
There
was
a
flash
of
light
and
a
sharp
electrical
sizzle,
and
Katherine
saw
Langdon
go
rigid.
Eyes
frozen
wide,
Langdon
lurched
forward,
collapsing
down
in
a
paralyzed
heap.
He
fell
hard
on
top
of
his
leather
bag,
the
pyramid
tumbling
out
onto
the
floor.
Without
so
much
as
a
glance
down
at
his
victim,
the
tattooed
man
stepped
over
Langdon
and
headed
directly
for
Katherine.
She
was
already
crawling
backward
into
the
dining
room,
where
she
collided
with
a
chair.
The
female
security
guard,
who
had
been
propped
in
that
chair,
now
wobbled
and
dropped
to
the
floor
in
a
heap
beside
her.
The
woman's
lifeless
expression
was
one
of
terror.
Her
mouth
was
stuffed
with
a
rag.
The
enormous
man
had
reached
her
before
Katherine
had
time
to
react.
He
seized
her
by
the
shoulders
with
impossible
strength.
His
face,
no
longer
covered
by
makeup,
was
an
utterly
terrifying
sight.
His
muscles
flexed,
and
she
felt
herself
being
flipped
over
onto
her
stomach
like
a
rag
doll.
A
heavy
knee
ground
into
her
back,
and
for
a
moment,
she
thought
she
would
break
in
two.
He
grabbed
her
arms
and
pulled
them
backward.
With
her
head
now
turned
to
one
side
and
her
cheek
pressed
into
the
carpet,
Katherine
could
see
Langdon,
his
body
still
jerking,
facing
away
from
her.
Beyond
that,
Agent
Hartmann
lay
motionless
in
the
foyer.
Cold
metal
pinched
Katherine'
s
wrists,
and
she
realized
she
was
being
bound
with
wire.
In
terror,
she
tried
to
pull
away,
but
doing
so
sent
searing
pain
into
her
hands.
"This
wire
will
cut
you
if
you
move,"
the
man
said,
finishing
with
her
wrists
and
moving
down
to
her
ankles
with
frightening
efficiency.
Katherine
kicked
at
him,
and
he
threw
a
powerful
fist
into
the
back
of
her
right
thigh,
crippling
her
leg.
Within
seconds,
her
ankles
were
bound.
"Robert!"
she
now
managed
to
call
out.
Langdon
was
groaning
on
the
floor
in
the
hallway.
He
lay
crumpled
on
his
leather
bag
with
the
stone
pyramid
lying
on
its
side
near
his
head.
Katherine
realized
the
pyramid
was
her
last
hope.
"We
deciphered
the
pyramid!"
she
told
her
attacker.
"I'll
tell
you
everything!"
"Yes,
you
will."
With
that,
he
pulled
the
cloth
from
the
dead
woman's
mouth
and
firmly
stuffed
it
into
Katherine'
s.
It
tasted
like
death.
Robert
Langdon's
body
was
not
his
own.
He
lay,
numb
and
immobile,
his
cheek
pressed
against
the
hardwood
floor.
He
had
heard
enough
about
stun
guns
to
know
they
crippled
their
victims
by
temporarily
overloading
the
nervous
system.
Their
action
something
called
electromuscular
disruption
might
as
well
have
been
a
bolt
of
lightning.
The
excruciating
jolt
of
pain
seemed
to
penetrate
every
molecule
of
his
body.
Now,
despite
his
mind's
focused
intention,
his
muscles
refused
to
obey
the
command
he
was
sending
them.
Get
up!
Facedown,
paralyzed
on
the
floor,
Langdon
was
gulping
shallow
breaths,
scarcely
able
to
inhale.
He
had
yet
to
lay
eyes
on
the
man
who
had
attacked
him,
but
he
could
see
Agent
Hartmann
lying
in
an
expanding
pool
of
blood.
Langdon
had
heard
Katherine
struggling
and
arguing,
but
moments
ago
her
voice
had
become
muffled,
as
if
the
man
had
stuffed
something
in
her
mouth.
Get
up,
Robert!
You
've
got
to
help
her!
Langdon's
legs
were
tingling
now,
a
fiery
and
painful
recovery
of
feeling,
but
still
they
refused
to
cooperate.
Move!
His
arms
twitched
as
sensation
started
to
come
back,
along
with
feeling
in
his
face
and
neck.
With
great
effort,
he
managed
to
rotate
his
head,
dragging
his
cheek
roughly
across
the
hardwood
floor
as
he
turned
his
head
to
look
down
into
the
dining
room.
Langdon's
sight
line
was
impeded
by
the
stone
pyramid,
which
had
toppled
out
of
his
bag
and
was
lying
sideways
on
the
floor,
its
base
inches
from
his
face.
For
an
instant,
Langdon
didn't
understand
what
he
was
looking
at.
The
square
of
stone
before
him
was
obviously
the
base
of
the
pyramid,
and
yet
it
looked
somehow
different.
Very
different.
It
was
still
square,
and
still
stone
but
it
was
no
longer
flat
and
smooth.
The
base
of
the
pyramid
was
covered
with
engraved
markings.
How
is
this
possible?
He
stared
for
several
seconds,
wondering
if
he
was
hallucinating.
/
looked
at
the
base
of
this
pyramid
a
dozen
times
and
there
were
no
markings!
Langdon
now
realized
why.
His
breathing
reflex
kick-started,
and
he
drew
a
sudden
gasp
of
air,
realizing
that
the
Masonic
Pyramid
had
secrets
yet
to
share.
/
have
witnessed
another
transformation.
In
a
flash,
Langdon
understood
the
meaning
of
Galloway's
last
request.
Tell
Peter
this:
The
Masonic
Pyramid
has
always
kept
her
secret
sincerely.
The
words
had
seemed
strange
at
the
time,
but
now
Langdon
understood
that
Dean
Galloway
was
sending
Peter
a
code.
Ironically,
this
same
code
had
been
a
plot
twist
in
a
mediocre
thriller
Langdon
had
read
years
ago.
Sin-cere.
Since
the
days
of
Michelangelo,
sculptors
had
been
hiding
the
flaws
in
their
work
by
smearing
hot
wax
into
the
cracks
and
then
dabbing
the
wax
with
stone
dust.
The
method
was
considered
cheating,
and
therefore,
any
sculpture
"without
wax"
literally
sine
cera
was
considered
a
"sincere"
piece
of
art.
The
phrase
stuck.
To
this
day
we
still
sign
our
letters
"sincerely"
as
a
promise
that
we
have
written
"without
wax"
and
that
our
words
are
true.
The
engravings
on
the
base
of
this
pyramid
had
been
concealed
by
the
same
method.
When
Katherine
followed
the
capstone's
directions
and
boiled
the
pyramid,
the
wax
melted
away,
revealing
the
writing
on
the
base.
Galloway
had
run
his
hands
over
the
pyramid
in
the
sitting
room,
apparently
feeling
the
markings
exposed
on
the
bottom.
Now,
if
only
for
an
instant,
Langdon
had
forgotten
all
the
danger
he
and
Katherine
faced.
He
stared
at
the
incredible
array
of
symbols
on
the
base
of
the
pyramid.
He
had
no
idea
what
they
meant
or
what
they
would
ultimately
reveal,
but
one
thing
was
for
certain.
The
Masonic
Pyramid
has
secrets
left
to
tell.
Eight
Franklin
Square
is
not
the
final
answer.
Whether
it
was
this
adrenaline-filled
revelation
or
simply
the
extra
few
seconds
lying
there,
Langdon
did
not
know,
but
he
suddenly
felt
control
returning
to
his
body.
Painfully,
he
swept
an
arm
to
one
side,
pushing
the
leather
bag
out
of
the
way
to
clear
his
sight
line
into
the
dining
room.
To
his
horror,
he
saw
that
Katherine
had
been
tied
up,
and
a
large
rag
had
been
stuffed
deep
into
her
mouth.
Langdon
flexed
his
muscles,
trying
to
climb
to
his
knees,
but
a
moment
later,
he
froze
in
utter
disbelief.
The
dining-room
doorway
had
just
filled
with
a
chilling
sight
a
human
form
unlike
anything
Langdon
had
ever
seen.
What
in
the
name
of
God
?!
Langdon
rolled,
kicking
with
his
legs,
trying
to
back
away,
but
the
huge
tattooed
man
grabbed
him,
flipping
him
onto
his
back
and
straddling
his
chest.
He
placed
his
knees
on
Langdon'
s
biceps,
pinning
Langdon
pain
fully
to
the
floor.
The
man's
chest
bore
a
rippling
double-headed
phoenix.
His
neck,
face,
and
shaved
head
were
covered
with
a
dazzling
array
of
unusually
intricate
symbols
sigils,
Langdon
knew
which
were
used
in
the
rituals
of
dark
ceremonial
magic.
Before
Langdon
could
process
anything
more,
the
huge
man
clasped
Langdon'
s
ears
between
his
palms,
lifted
his
head
up
off
the
floor,
and,
with
incredible
force,
smashed
it
back
down
onto
the
hardwood.
Everything
went
black.
Mal'akh
stood
in
his
hallway
and
surveyed
the
carnage
around
him.
His
home
looked
like
a
battlefield.
Robert
Langdon
lay
unconscious
at
his
feet.
Katherine
Solomon
was
bound
and
gagged
on
the
dining-room
floor.
The
corpse
of
a
female
security
guard
lay
crumpled
nearby,
having
toppled
off
the
chair
where
she
was
propped.
This
female
guard,
eager
to
save
her
own
life,
had
done
exactly
as
Mal'akh
commanded.
With
a
knife
to
her
throat,
she
had
answered
Mal'akh's
cell
phone
and
told
the
lie
that
had
coaxed
Langdon
and
Katherine
to
come
racing
out
here.
She
had
no
partner,
and
Peter
Solomon
was
certainly
not
okay.
As
soon
as
the
woman
had
given
her
performance,
Mal'akh
had
quietly
strangled
her.
To
complete
the
illusion
that
Mal'akh
was
not
home,
he
had
phoned
Bellamy
using
the
hands-free
speaker
in
one
of
his
cars.
I'm
on
the
road,
he
had
told
Bellamy
and
whoever
else
had
been
listening.
Peter
is
in
my
trunk.
In
fact,
Mal'akh
was
driving
only
between
his
garage
and
his
front
yard,
where
he
had
left
several
of
his
myriad
cars
parked
askew
with
the
headlights
on
and
the
engines
running.
The
deception
had
worked
perfectly.
Almost.
The
only
wrinkle
was
the
bloody
black-clad
heap
in
the
foyer
with
a
screwdriver
protruding
from
his
neck.
Mal'akh
searched
the
corpse
and
had
to
chuckle
when
he
found
a
high-tech
transceiver
and
cell
phone
with
a
CIA
logo.
It
seems
even
they
are
aware
of
my
power.
He
removed
the
batteries
and
crushed
both
devices
with
a
heavy
bronze
doorstop.
Mal'akh
knew
he
had
to
move
quickly
now,
especially
if
the
CIA
was
involved.
He
strode
back
over
to
Langdon.
The
professor
was
out
cold
and
would
be
for
a
while.
Mal'akh's
eyes
moved
with
trepidation
now
to
the
stone
pyramid
on
the
floor
beside
the
professor's
open
bag.
His
breath
caught,
and
his
heart
pounded.
/
have
waited
for
years
His
hands
trembled
slightly
as
he
reached
down
and
picked
up
the
Masonic
Pyramid.
As
he
ran
his
fingers
slowly
across
the
engravings,
he
felt
awed
by
their
promise.
Before
he
became
too
entranced,
he
put
the
pyramid
back
in
Langdon'
s
bag
with
the
capstone
and
zipped
it
up.

assemble
the
pyramid
soon
in
a
much
safer
location.
He
threw
Langdon'
s
bag
over
his
shoulder
and
then
tried
to
hoist
Langdon
himself,
but
the
professor's
toned
physique
weighed
much
more
than
anticipated.
Mal'akh
settled
on
grabbing
him
beneath
the
armpits
and
dragging
him
across
the
floor.
He's
not
going
to
like
where
he
ends
up,
Mal'akh
thought.
As
he
dragged
Langdon
off,
the
television
in
the
kitchen
blared.
The
sound
of
voices
from
the
TV
had
been
part
of
the
deception,
and
Mal'akh
had
yet
to
turn
it
off.
The
station
was
now
broadcasting
a
televangelist
leading
his
congregation
in
the
Lord's
Prayer.
Mal'akh
wondered
if
any
of
his
hypnotized
viewers
had
any
idea
where
this
prayer
really
came
from.
"
On
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven"
the
group
intoned.
Yes,
Mal'akh
thought.
As
above,
so
below.
"
And
lead
us
not
into
temptation"
Help
us
master
the
weakness
of
our
flesh.
"
Deliver
us
from
evil"
they
all
beseeched.
Mal'akh
smiled.
That
could
be
difficult.
The
darkness
is
growing.
Even
so,
he
had
to
give
them
credit
for
trying.
Humans
who
spoke
to
invisible
forces
and
requested
help
were
a
dying
breed
in
this
modern
world.
Mal'akh
was
dragging
Langdon
across
the
living
room
when
the
congregation
declared,
"Amen!"
Amon,
Mal'akh
corrected.
Egypt
is
the
cradle
of
your
religion.
The
god
Amon
was
the
prototype
for
Zeus
for
Jupiter
and
for
every
modern
face
of
God.
To
this
day,
every
religion
on
earth
shouted
out
a
variation
of
his
name.
Amen!
Aminl
Auml
The
televangelist
began
quoting
verses
from
the
Bible
describing
hierarchies
of
angels,
demons,
and
spirits
that
ruled
in
heaven
and
hell.
"Protect
your
souls
from
evil
forces!"
he
warned
them.
"Lift
your
hearts
in
prayer!
God
and
his
angels
will
hear
you!"
He's
right,
Mal'akh
knew.
But
so
will
the
demons.
Mal'akh
had
learned
long
ago
that
through
proper
application
of
the
Art,
a
practitioner
could
open
a
portal
to
the
spiritual
realm.
The
invisible
forces
that
existed
there,
much
like
man
himself,
came
in
many
forms,
both
good
and
evil.
Those
of
Light
healed,
protected,
and
sought
to
bring
order
to
the
universe.
Those
of
Dark
functioned
oppositely
bringing
destruction
and
chaos.
If
properly
summoned,
the
invisible
forces
could
be
persuaded
to
do
a
practitioner's
bidding
on
earth
thus
instilling
him
with
seemingly
supernatural
power.
In
exchange
for
helping
the
summoner,
these
forces
required
offerings
prayers
and
praise
for
those
of
Light
and
the
spilling
of
blood
for
those
of
Dark.
The
greater
the
sacrifice,
the
greater
the
power
that
is
transferred.
Mal'akh
had
begun
his
practice
with
the
blood
of
inconsequential
animals.
Over
time,
however,
his
choices
for
sacrifice
had
become
more
bold.
Tonight,
I
take
the
final
step.
"Beware!"
the
preacher
shouted,
warning
of
the
coming
Apocalypse.
"The
final
battle
for
the
souls
of
man
will
soon
be
fought!"
Indeed,
Mal'akh
thought.
And
I
shall
become
its
greatest
warrior.
This
battle,
of
course,
had
begun
long,
long
ago.
In
ancient
Egypt,
those
who
perfected
the
Art
had
become
the
great
Adepts
of
history,
evolving
beyond
the
masses
to
become
true
practitioners
of
Light.
They
moved
as
gods
on
earth.
They
built
great
temples
of
initiation
to
which
neophytes
traveled
from
around
the
world
to
partake
of
the
wisdom.
There
arose
a
race
of
golden
men.
For
a
brief
span
of
time,
mankind
seemed
poised
to
elevate
himself
and
transcend
his
earthly
bonds.
The
golden
age
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries.
And
yet
man,
being
of
the
flesh,
was
susceptible
to
the
sins
of
hubris,
hatred,
impatience,
and
greed.
Over
time,
there
were
those
who
corrupted
the
Art,
perverting
it
and
abusing
its
power
for
personal
gain.
They
began
using
this
perverted
version
to
summon
dark
forces.
A
different
Art
evolved
a
more
potent,
immediate,
and
intoxicating
influence.
Such
is
my
Art.
Such
is
my
Great
Work.
The
illuminated
Adepts
and
their
esoteric
fraternities
witnessed
the
rising
evil
and
saw
that
man
was
not
using
his
newfound
knowledge
for
the
good
of
his
species.
And
so
they
hid
their
wisdom
to
keep
it
from
the
eyes
of
the
unworthy.
Eventually,
it
was
lost
to
history.
With
this
came
the
Great
Fall
of
Man.
And
a
lasting
darkness.
To
this
day,
the
noble
descendants
of
the
Adepts
soldiered
on,
grasping
blindly
for
the
Light,
trying
to
recapture
the
lost
power
of
their
past,
trying
to
keep
the
darkness
at
bay.
They
were
the
priests
and
priestesses
of
the
churches,
temples,
and
shrines
of
all
the
religions
on
earth.
Time
had
erased
the
memories
.
.
.
detached
them
from
their
past.
They
no
longer
knew
the
Source
from
which
their
potent
wisdom
had
once
flowed.
When
they
were
asked
about
the
divine
mysteries
of
their
forebears,
the
new
custodians
of
faith
vociferously
disowned
them,
condemning
them
as
heresy.
Have
they
truly
forgotten!
Mal'akh
wondered.
Echoes
of
the
ancient
Art
still
resonated
in
every
corner
of
the
globe,
from
the
mystical
Kabbalists
of
Judaism
to
the
esoteric
Sufis
of
Islam.
Vestiges
remained
in
the
arcane
rituals
of
Christianity,
in
its
god-
eating
rites
of
Holy
Communion,
its
hierarchies
of
saints,
angels,
and
demons,
its
chanting
and
incantation,
its
holy
calendar's
astrological
underpinnings,
its
consecrated
robes,
and
in
its
promise
of
everlasting
life.
Even
now,
its
priests
dispelled
evil
spirits
by
swinging
smoke-filled
censers,
ringing
sacred
bells,
and
sprinkling
holy
water.
Christians
still
practiced
the
supernatural
craft
of
exorcism
an
early
practice
of
their
faith
that
required
the
ability
not
only
to
cast
out
demons
but
to
summon
them.
And
yet
they
cannot
see
their
past?
Nowhere
was
the
church's
mystical
past
more
evident
than
at
her
epicenter.
In
Vatican
City,
at
the
heart
of
St.
Peter's
Square,
stood
the
great
Egyptian
obelisk.
Carved
thirteen
hundred
years
before
Jesus
took
his
first
breath
this
numinous
monolith
had
no
relevance
there,
no
link
to
modern
Christianity.
And
yet
there
it
was.
At
the
core
of
Christ's
church.
A
stone
beacon,
screaming
to
be
heard.
A
reminder
to
those
few
sages
who
remembered
where
it
all
began.
This
church,
born
of
the
womb
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries,
still
bore
her
rites
and
symbols.
One
symbol
above
all.
Adorning
her
altars,
vestments,
spires,
and
Scripture
was
the
singular
image
of
Christianity
that
of
a
precious,
sacrificed
human
being.
Christianity,
more
than
any
other
faith,
understood
the
transformative
power
of
sacrifice.
Even
now,
to
honor
the
sacrifice
made
by
Jesus,
his
followers
proffered
their
own
feeble
gestures
of
personal
sacrifice
fasting,
Lenten
renunciation,
tithing.
All
of
those
offerings
are
impotent,
of
course.
Without
blood
there
is
no
true
sacrifice.
The
powers
of
darkness
had
long
embraced
blood
sacrifice,
and
in
doing
so,
they
had
grown
so
strong
that
the
powers
of
goodness
now
struggled
to
keep
them
in
check.
Soon
the
Light
would
be
entirely
consumed,
and
the
practitioners
of
darkness
would
move
freely
through
the
minds
of
men.
"Eight
Franklin
Square
must
exist,"
Sato
insisted.
"Look
it
up
again!"
Nola
Kaye
sat
at
her
desk
and
adjusted
her
headset.
"Ma'am,
I've
checked
everywhere
that
address
doesn't
exist
in
D.C."
"But
I'm
on
the
roof
of
One
Franklin
Square,"
Sato
said.
"There
has
to
be
an
Eightl"
Director
Sato
's
on
a
roof?
"Hold
on."
Nola
began
running
a
new
search.
She
was
considering
telling
the
OS
director
about
the
hacker,
but
Sato
seemed
fixated
on
Eight
Franklin
Square
at
the
moment.
Besides,
Nola
still
didn't
have
all
the
information.
Where's
that
damned
sys-sec,
anyway?
"Okay,"
Nola
said,
eyeing
her
screen,
"I
see
the
problem.
One
Franklin
Square
is
the
name
of
the
building
.
.
.
not
the
address.
The
address
is
actually
1301
K
Street."
The
news
seemed
to
confound
the
director.
"Nola,
I
don't
have
time
to
explain
the
pyramid
clearly
points
to
the
address
Eight
Franklin
Square."
Nola
sat
bolt
upright.
The
pyramid
points
to
a
specific
location
?
"The
inscription,"
Sato
continued,
"reads:
'The
secret
hides
within
The
Order
Eight
Franklin
Square.'"
Nola
could
scarcely
imagine.
"An
order
like
a
Masonic
or
fraternal
order?"
"I
assume
so,"
Sato
replied.
Nola
thought
a
moment,
and
then
began
typing
again.
"Ma'am,
maybe
the
street
numbers
on
the
square
changed
over
the
years?
I
mean,
if
this
pyramid
is
as
old
as
legend
claims,
maybe
the
numbers
on
Franklin
Square
were
different
when
the
pyramid
was
built?
I'm
now
running
a
search
without
the
number
eight

'the

'Franklin
Square'
and
'Washington,
D.C

this
way,

might
get
some
idea
if

She
stalled
midsentence
as
the
search
results
appeared.
"What
have
you
got?"
Sato
demanded.
Nola
stared
at
the
first
result
on
the
list
a
spectacular
image
of
the
Great
Pyramid
of
Egypt
which
served
as
the
thematic
backdrop
for
the
home
page
dedicated
to
a
building
on
Franklin
Square.
The
building
was
unlike
any
other
building
on
the
square.
Or
in
the
entire
city,
for
that
matter.
What
stopped
Nola
cold
was
not
the
building's
bizarre
architecture,
but
rather
the
description
of
its
purpose.
According
to
the
Web
site,
this
unusual
edifice
was
built
as
a
sacred
mystical
shrine,
designed
by
and
designed
for
an
ancient
secret
order.
Robert
Langdon
regained
consciousness
with
a
crippling
headache.
Where
am
I?
Wherever
he
was,
it
was
dark.
Deep-cave
dark,
and
deathly
silent.
He
was
lying
on
his
back
with
his
arms
at
his
side.
Confused,
he
tried
moving
his
fingers
and
toes,
relieved
to
find
they
moved
freely
with
no
pain.
What
happened?
With
the
exception
of
his
headache
and
the
profound
darkness,
everything
seemed
more
or
less
normal.
Almost
everything.
Langdon
realized
he
was
lying
on
a
hard
floor
that
felt
unusually
smooth,
like
a
sheet
of
glass.
Stranger
still,
he
could
feel
that
the
slick
surface
was
in
direct
contact
with
his
bare
flesh
shoulders,
back,
buttocks,
thighs,
calves.
Am
I
naked?
Puzzled,
he
ran
his
hands
over
his
body.
Jesus!
Where
the
hell
are
my
clothes?
In
the
darkness,
the
cobwebs
began
to
lift,
and
Langdon
saw
flashes
of
memory
frightening
snapshots
a
dead
CIA
agent
the
face
of
a
tattooed
beast
Langdon'
s
head
smashing
into
the
floor.
The
images
came
faster
and
now
he
recalled
the
sickening
image
of
Katherine
Solomon
bound
and
gagged
on
the
dining-room
floor.
My
God!
Langdon
sat
bolt
upright,
and
as
he
did,
his
forehead
smashed
into
something
suspended
only
inches
above
him.
Pain
exploded
through
his
skull
and
he
fell
back,
teetering
near
unconsciousness.
Groggy,
he
reached
up
with
his
hands,
groping
in
the
darkness
to
find
the
obstacle.
What
he
found
made
no
sense
to
him.
It
seemed
this
room's
ceiling
was
less
than
a
foot
above
him.
What
in
the
world?
As
he
spread
his
arms
to
his
sides
in
an
attempt
to
roll
over,
both
of
his
hands
hit
side
walls.
The
truth
now
dawned
on
him.
Robert
Langdon
was
not
in
a
room
at
all.
I'm
in
a
box!
In
the
darkness
of
his
small,
coffinlike
container,
Langdon
began
pounding
wildly
with
his
fist.
He
shouted
over
and
over
for
help.
The
terror
that
gripped
him
deepened
with
each
passing
instant
until
it
was
intolerable.
/
have
been
buried
alive.
The
lid
of
Langdon's
strange
coffin
refused
to
budge,
even
with
the
full
force
of
his
arms
and
legs
pushing
upward
in
wild
panic.
The
box,
from
all
he
could
tell,
was
made
of
heavy
fiberglass.
Airtight.
Soundproof.
Lightproof.
Escape-proof.
/
am
going
to
suffocate
alone
in
this
box.
He
thought
of
the
deep
well
into
which
he
had
fallen
as
a
young
boy,
and
of
the
terrifying
night
he
spent
treading
water
alone
in
the
darkness
of
a
bottomless
pit.
That
trauma
had
scarred
Langdon's
psyche,
burdening
him
with
an
overwhelming
phobia
of
enclosed
spaces.
Tonight,
buried
alive,
Robert
Langdon
was
living
his
ultimate
nightmare.
Katherine
Solomon
trembled
in
silence
on
the
floor
of
Mal'akh's
dining
room.
The
sharp
wire
around
her
wrists
and
ankles
had
already
cut
into
her,
and
the
slightest
movements
seemed
only
to
tighten
her
bonds.
The
tattooed
man
had
brutally
knocked
Langdon
unconscious
and
dragged
his
limp
body
across
the
floor
along
with
his
leather
bag
and
the
stone
pyramid.
Where
they
had
gone,
Katherine
had
no
idea.
The
agent
who
had
accompanied
them
was
dead.
She
had
not
heard
a
sound
in
many
minutes,
and
she
wondered
if
the
tattooed
man
and
Langdon
were
still
inside
the
house.
She
had
been
trying
to
scream
for
help,
but
with
each
attempt,
the
rag
in
her
mouth
crept
back
dangerously
closer
to
her
windpipe.
Now
she
felt
approaching
footsteps
on
the
floor,
and
she
turned
her
head,
hoping
against
hope
that
someone
was
coming
to
help.
The
massive
silhouette
of
her
captor
materialized
in
the
hallway.
Katherine
recoiled
as
she
flashed
on
the
image
of
him
standing
in
her
family
home
ten
years
earlier.
He
killed
my
family.
Now
he
strode
toward
her.
Langdon
was
nowhere
to
be
seen.
The
man
crouched
down
and
gripped
her
around
the
waist,
hoisting
her
roughly
onto
his
shoulder.
The
wire
sliced
into
her
wrists,
and
the
rag
muffled
her
muted
cries
of
pain.
He
carried
her
down
the
hallway
toward
the
living
room,
where,
earlier
today,
the
two
of
them
had
calmly
sipped
tea
together.
Where
is
he
taking
me?!
He
carried
Katherine
across
the
living
room
and
stopped
directly
in
front
of
the
large
oil
painting
of
the
Three
Graces
that
she
had
admired
this
afternoon.
"You
mentioned
you
liked
this
painting,"
the
man
whispered,
his
lips
practically
touching
her
ear.
"I'm
glad.
It
may
be
the
last
thing
of
beauty
you
see."
With
that,
he
reached
out
and
pressed
his
palm
into
the
right
side
of
the
enormous
frame.
To
Katherine'
s
shock,
the
painting
rotated
into
the
wall,
turning
on
a
central
pivot
like
a
revolving
door.
A
hidden
doorway.
Katherine
tried
to
wriggle
free,
but
the
man
held
her
firmly,
carrying
her
through
the
opening
behind
the
canvas.
As
the
Three
Graces
pivoted
shut
behind
them,
she
could
see
heavy
insulation
on
the
back
of
the
canvas.
Whatever
sounds
were
made
back
here
were
apparently
not
meant
to
be
heard
by
the
outside
world.
The
space
behind
the
painting
was
cramped,
more
like
a
hallway
than
a
room.
The
man
carried
her
to
the
far
side
and
opened
a
heavy
door,
carrying
her
through
it
onto
a
small
landing.
Katherine
found
herself
looking
down
a
narrow
ramp
into
a
deep
basement.
She
drew
a
breath
to
scream,
but
the
rag
was
choking
her.
The
incline
was
steep
and
narrow.
The
walls
on
either
side
were
made
of
cement,
awash
in
a
bluish
light
that
seemed
to
emanate
from
below.
The
air
that
wafted
up
was
warm
and
pungent,
laden
with
an
eerie
blend
of
smells
the
sharp
bite
of
chemicals,
the
smooth
calm
of
incense,
the
earthy
musk
of
human
sweat,
and,
pervading
it
all,
a
distinct
aura
of
visceral,
animal
fear.
"Your
science
impressed
me,"
the
man
whispered
as
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
ramp.
"I
hope
mine
impresses
you."
CIA
field
agent
Turner
Simkins
crouched
in
the
darkness
of
Franklin
Park
and
kept
his
steady
gaze
on
Warren
Bellamy.
Nobody
had
taken
the
bait
yet,
but
it
was
still
early.
Simkins'
s
transceiver
beeped,
and
he
activated
it,
hoping
one
of
his
men
had
spotted
something.
But
it
was
Sato.
She
had
new
information.
Simkins
listened
and
agreed
with
her
concern.
"Hold
on,"
he
said.
"I'll
see
if
I
can
get
a
visual."
He
crawled
through
the
bushes
in
which
he
was
hiding
and
peered
back
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
entered
the
square.
After
some
maneuvering,
he
finally
opened
a
sight
line.
Holy
shit.
He
was
staring
at
a
building
that
looked
like
an
Old
World
mosque.
Nestled
between
two
much
larger
buildings,
the
Moorish
facade
was
made
of
gleaming
terra-cotta
tile
laid
in
intricate
multicolored
designs.
Above
the
three
massive
doors,
two
tiers
of
lancet
windows
looked
as
if
Arabian
archers
might
appear
and
open
fire
if
anyone
approached
uninvited.
"I
see
it,"
Simkins
said.
"Any
activity?"
"Nothing."
"Good.
I
need
you
to
reposition
and
watch
it
very
carefully.
It's
called
the
Almas
Shrine
Temple,
and
it's
the
headquarters
of
a
mystical
order."
Simkins
had
worked
in
the
D.C.
area
for
a
long
time
but
was
not
familiar
with
this
temple
or
any
ancient
mystical
order
headquartered
on
Franklin
Square.
"This
building,"
Sato
said,
"belongs
to
a
group
called
the
Ancient
Arabic
Order
of
Nobles
of
the
Mystic
Shrine."
"Never
heard
of
them."
"I
think
you
have,"
Sato
said.
"They're
an
appendant
body
of
the
Masons,
more
commonly
known
as
the
S
miners."
Simkins
shot
a
dubious
glance
at
the
ornate
building.
The
Shriners?
The
guys
who
build
hospitals
for
kids?
He
could
imagine
no
"order"
less
ominous
sounding
than
a
fraternity
of
philanthropists
who
wore
little
red
fezzes
and
marched
in
parades.
Even
so,
Sato's
concerns
were
valid.
"Ma'am,
if
our
target
realizes
that
this
building
is
in
fact
'The
Order'
on
Franklin
Square,
he
won't
need
the
address.
He'll
simply
bypass
the
rendezvous
and
go
directly
to
the
correct
location."
"My
thoughts
exactly.
Keep
an
eye
on
the
entrance."
"Yes,
ma'am."
"Any
word
from
Agent
Hartmann
in
Kalorama
Heights?"
"No,
ma'am.
You
asked
him
to
phone
you
directly."
"Well,
he
hasn't."
Odd,
Simkins
thought,
checking
his
watch.
He
's
overdue.
Robert
Langdon
lay
shivering,
naked
and
alone
in
total
blackness.
Paralyzed
by
fear,
he
was
no
longer
pounding
or
shouting.
Instead,
he
had
closed
his
eyes
and
was
doing
his
best
to
control
his
hammering
heart
and
his
panicked
breathing.
You
are
lying
beneath
a
vast,
nighttime
sky,
he
tried
to
convince
himself.
There
is
nothing
above
you
but
miles
of
wide-open
space.
This
calming
visualization
had
been
the
only
way
he
had
managed
to
survive
a
recent
stint
in
an
enclosed
MRI
machine
that
and
a
triple
dose
of
Valium.
Tonight,
however,
the
visualization
was
having
no
effect
whatsoever.
The
rag
in
Katherine
Solomon's
mouth
had
shifted
backward
and
was
all
but
choking
her.
Her
captor
had
carried
her
down
a
narrow
ramp
and
into
a
dark
basement
corridor.
At
the
far
end
of
the
hall,
she
had
glimpsed
a
room
lit
with
an
eerie
reddish-purple
light,
but
they'd
never
made
it
that
far.
The
man
had
stopped
instead
at
a
small
side
room,
carried
her
inside,
and
placed
her
on
a
wooden
chair.
He
had
set
her
down
with
her
bound
wrists
behind
the
chair
back
so
she
could
not
move.
Now
Katherine
could
feel
the
wire
on
her
wrists
slicing
deeper
into
her
flesh.
The
pain
barely
registered
next
to
the
rising
panic
she
was
feeling
over
being
unable
to
breathe.
The
cloth
in
her
mouth
was
slipping
deeper
into
her
throat,
and
she
felt
herself
gagging
reflexively.
Her
vision
started
to
tunnel.
Behind
her,
the
tattooed
man
closed
the
room's
lone
door
and
flipped
on
the
light.
Katherine'
s
eyes
were
watering
profusely
now,
and
she
could
no
longer
differentiate
objects
in
her
immediate
surroundings.
Everything
had
become
a
blur.
A
distorted
vision
of
colorful
flesh
appeared
before
her,
and
Katherine
felt
her
eyes
starting
to
flutter
as
she
teetered
on
the
brink
of
unconsciousness.
A
scale-covered
arm
reached
out
and
yanked
the
rag
from
her
mouth.
Katherine
gasped,
inhaling
deep
breaths,
coughing
and
choking
as
her
lungs
flooded
with
precious
air.
Slowly,
her
vision
began
to
clear,
and
she
found
herself
looking
into
the
demon's
face.
The
visage
was
barely
human.
Blanketing
his
neck,
face,
and
shaved
head
was
an
astounding
pattern
of
bizarre
tattooed
symbols.
With
the
exception
of
a
small
circle
on
top
of
his
head,
every
inch
of
his
body
appeared
to
be
decorated.
A
massive
double-headed
phoenix
on
his
chest
glared
at
her
through
nipple
eyes
like
some
kind
of
ravenous
vulture,
patiently
waiting
for
her
death.
"Open
your
mouth,"
the
man
whispered.
Katherine
stared
at
the
monster
with
total
revulsion.
What?
"Open
your
mouth,"
the
man
repeated.
"Or
the
cloth
goes
back
in."
Trembling,
Katherine
opened
her
mouth.
The
man
extended
his
thick,
tattooed
index
finger,
inserting
it
between
her
lips.
When
he
touched
her
tongue,
Katherine
thought
she
would
vomit.
He
extracted
his
wet
finger
and
raised
it
to
the
top
of
his
shaved
head.
Closing
his
eyes,
he
massaged
her
saliva
into
his
small
circular
patch
of
untattooed
flesh.
Repulsed,
Katherine
looked
away.
The
room
in
which
she
was
sitting
appeared
to
be
a
boiler
room
of
some
sort
pipes
on
the
walls,
gurgling
sounds,
fluorescent
lights.
Before
she
could
take
in
her
surroundings,
though,
her
gaze
stopped
dead
on
something
beside
her
on
the
floor.
A
pile
of
clothing
turtleneck,
tweed
sport
coat,
loafers,
Mickey
Mouse
watch.
"My
God!"
She
wheeled
back
to
the
tattooed
animal
before
her.
"What
have
you
done
with
Robert?!"
"Shh,"
the
man
whispered.
"Or
he'll
hear
you."
He
stepped
to
one
side
and
motioned
behind
him.
Langdon
was
not
there.
All
Katherine
saw
was
a
huge
black
fiberglass
box.
Its
shape
bore
an
unsettling
resemblance
to
the
heavy
crates
in
which
corpses
were
shipped
back
from
war.
Two
massive
clasps
firmly
locked
the
box
shut.
"He's
inside?]"
Katherine
blurted.
"But
he'll
suffocate!"
"No,
he
won't,"
the
man
said,
pointing
to
a
series
of
transparent
pipes
that
ran
along
the
wall
into
the
bottom
of
the
crate.
"He'll
only
wish
he
could."
In
total
darkness,
Langdon
listened
intently
to
the
muffled
vibrations
he
now
heard
from
the
outside
world.
Voices?
He
began
pounding
on
the
box
and
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
lungs.
"Help!
Can
anyone
hear
me?!"
Far
off,
a
muted
voice
called
out.
"Robert!
My
God,
no!
NO!"
He
knew
the
voice.
It
was
Katherine,
and
she
sounded
terrified.
Even
so,
it
was
a
welcome
sound.
Langdon
drew
a
breath
to
call
out
to
her,
but
he
stopped
short,
feeling
an
unexpected
sensation
at
the
back
of
his
neck.
A
faint
breeze
seemed
to
be
emanating
from
the
bottom
of
the
box.
How
is
that
possible?
He
lay
very
still,
taking
stock.
Yes,
definitely.
He
could
feel
the
tiny
hairs
on
the
back
of
his
neck
being
tickled
by
air
movement.
Instinctively,
Langdon
began
feeling
along
the
floor
of
the
box,
searching
for
the
source
of
the
air.
It
took
only
a
moment
to
locate.
There's
a
tiny
vent!
The
small
perforated
opening
felt
similar
to
a
drain
plate
on
a
sink
or
tub,
except
that
a
soft,
steady
breeze
was
now
coming
up
through
it.
He
's
pumping
air
in
for
me.
He
doesn
't
want
me
to
suffocate.
Langdon'
s
relief
was
short-lived.
A
terrifying
sound
was
now
emanating
up
through
the
holes
in
the
vent.
It
was
the
unmistakable
gurgle
of
flowing
liquid
coming
his
way.
Katherine
stared
in
disbelief
at
the
clear
shaft
of
liquid
that
was
progressing
down
one
of
the
pipes
toward
Langdon'
s
crate.
The
scene
looked
like
some
kind
of
twisted
stage
magician's
act.
He's
pumping
water
into
the
crate?!
Katherine
strained
at
her
bonds,
ignoring
the
deep
bite
of
the
wires
around
her
wrists.
All
she
could
do
was
look
on
in
panic.
She
could
hear
Langdon
pounding
in
desperation,
but
as
the
water
reached
the
underside
of
the
container,
the
pounding
stopped.
There
was
a
moment
of
terrified
silence.
Then
the
pounding
started
again
with
renewed
desperation.
"Let
him
out!"
Katherine
begged.
"Please!
You
can't
do
this!"
"Drowning
is
a
terrible
death,
you
know."
The
man
spoke
calmly
as
he
paced
around
her
in
circles.
"Your
assistant,
Trish,
could
tell
you
that."
Katherine
heard
his
words,
but
she
could
barely
process
them.
"You
may
remember
that
I
almost
drowned
once,"
the
man
whispered.
"It
was
on
your
family's
estate
in
Potomac.
Your
brother
shot
me,
and
I
fell
through
the
ice,
out
at
Zach's
bridge."
Katherine
glared
at
him,
filled
with
loathing.
The
night
you
killed
my
mother.
"The
gods
protected
me
that
night,"
he
said.
"And
they
showed
me
the
way
to
become
one
of
them."
The
water
gurgling
into
the
box
behind
Langdon'
s
head
felt
warm
body
temperature.
The
fluid
was
already
several
inches
deep
and
had
completely
swallowed
the
back
of
his
naked
body.
As
it
began
creeping
up
his
rib
cage,
Langdon
felt
a
stark
reality
closing
in
fast.
I'm
going
to
die.
With
renewed
panic,
he
raised
his
arms
and
began
pounding
wildly
again.
"You've
got
to
let
him
out!"
Katherine
begged,
crying
now.
"We'll
do
whatever
you
want!"
She
could
hear
Langdon
pounding
more
frantically
as
the
water
flowed
into
his
container.
The
tattooed
man
just
smiled.
"You're
easier
than
your
brother.
The
things
I
had
to
do
to
get
Peter
to
tell
me
his
secrets"
"Where
is
he?!"
she
demanded.
"Where
is
Peter?!
Tell
me!
We
did
exactly
what
you
wanted!
We
solved
the
pyramid
and
"No,
you
did
not
solve
the
pyramid.
You
played
a
game.
You
withheld
information
and
brought
a
government
agent
to
my
home.
Hardly
behavior
I
intend
to
reward."
"We
didn't
have
a
choice,"
she
replied,
choking
back
the
tears.
"The
CIA
is
looking
for
you.
They
made
us
travel
with
an
agent.
I'll
tell
you
everything.
Just
let
Robert
out!"
Katherine
could
hear
Langdon
shouting
and
pounding
in
the
crate,
and
she
could
see
the
water
flowing
through
the
pipe.
She
knew
he
didn't
have
a
lot
of
time.
In
front
of
her,
the
tattooed
man
spoke
calmly,
stroking
his
chin.
"I
assume
there
are
agents
waiting
for
me
at
Franklin
Square?"
Katherine
said
nothing,
and
the
man
placed
his
massive
palms
on
her
shoulders,
slowly
pulling
her
forward.
With
her
arms
still
wire-bound
be
hind
the
chair
back,
her
shoulders
strained,
burning
with
pain,
threatening
to
dislocate.
"Yes!"
Katherine
said.
"There
are
agents
at
Franklin
Square!"
He
pulled
harder.
"What
is
the
address
on
the
capstone?"
The
pain
in
her
wrists
and
shoulders
grew
unbearable,
but
Katherine
said
nothing.
"You
can
tell
me
now,
Katherine,
or
I'll
break
your
arms
and
ask
you
again."
"Eight!"
she
gasped
in
pain.
"The
missing
number
is
eightl
The
capstone
says:
'The
secret
hides
within
The
Order
Eight
Franklin
Square!'
I
swear
it.
I
don't
know
what
else
to
tell
you!
It's
Eight
Franklin
Square!"
The
man
still
did
not
release
her
shoulders.
"That's
all
I
know!"
Katherine
said.
"That's
the
address!
Let
go
of
me!
Let
Robert
out
of
that
tank!"
"I
would"
the
man
said,
"but
there's
one
problem.
I
can't
go
to
Eight
Franklin
Square
without
being
caught.
Tell
me,
what's
at
that
address?"
"I
don't
know!"
"And
the
symbols
on
the
base
of
the
pyramid?
On
the
underside?
Do
you
know
their
meaning?"
"What
symbols
on
the
base?"
Katherine
had
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about.
"The
bottom
has
no
symbols.
It's
smooth,
blank
stone!"
Apparently
immune
to
the
muffled
cries
for
help
emanating
from
the
coffinlike
crate,
the
tattooed
man
calmly
padded
over
to
Langdon's
day
-bag
and
retrieved
the
stone
pyramid.
Then
he
returned
to
Katherine
and
held
it
up
before
her
eyes
so
she
could
see
the
base.
When
Katherine
saw
the
engraved
symbols,
she
gasped
in
bewilderment.
But
that's
impossible!

The
bottom
of
the
pyramid
was
entirely
covered
with
intricate
carvings.
There
was
nothing
there
before!
I'm
sure
of
it!
She
had
no
idea
what
these
symbols
could
possibly
mean.
They
seemed
to
span
every
mystical
tradition,
including
many
she
could
not
even
place.
Total
chaos.
"I
have
no
idea
what
this
means,"
she
said.
"Nor
do
I,"
her
captor
said.
"Fortunately,
we
have
a
specialist
at
our
disposal."
He
glanced
at
the
crate.
"Let's
ask
him,
shall
we?"
He
carried
the
pyramid
toward
the
crate.
For
a
brief
instant
of
hope,
Katherine
thought
he
was
going
to
unclasp
the
lid.
Instead,
he
sat
calmly
on
top
of
the
box,
reached
down,
and
slid
a
small
panel
to
one
side,
revealing
a
Plexiglas
window
in
the
top
of
the
tank.
Light!
Langdon
covered
his
eyes,
squinting
into
the
ray
of
light
that
now
streamed
in
from
above.
As
his
eyes
adjusted,
hope
turned
to
confusion.
He
was
looking
up
through
what
appeared
to
be
a
window
in
the
top
of
his
crate.
Through
the
window,
he
saw
a
white
ceiling
and
a
fluorescent
light.
Without
warning,
the
tattooed
face
appeared
above
him,
peering
down.
"Where
is
Katherine?!"
Langdon
shouted.
"Let
me
out!"
The
man
smiled.
"Your
friend
Katherine
is
here
with
me,"
the
man
said.
"I
have
the
power
to
spare
her
life.
Your
life
as
well.
But
your
time
is
short,
so
I
suggest
you
listen
carefully."
Langdon
could
barely
hear
him
through
the
glass,
and
the
water
had
risen
higher,
creeping
across
his
chest.
"Are
you
aware,"
the
man
asked,
"that
there
are
symbols
on
the
base
of
the
pyramid?"
"Yes!"
Langdon
shouted,
having
seen
the
extensive
array
of
symbols
when
the
pyramid
had
lain
on
the
floor
upstairs.
"But
I
have
no
idea
what
they
mean!
You
need
to
go
to
Eight
Franklin
Square!
The
answer
is
there!
That's
what
the
capstone
"Professor,
you
and
I
both
know
the
CIA
is
waiting
for
me
there.
I
have
no
intention
of
walking
into
a
trap.
Besides,
I
didn't
need
the
street
number.
There
is
only
one
building
on
that
square
that
could
possibly
be
relevant
the
Almas
Shrine
Temple."
He
paused,
staring
down
at
Langdon.
"The
Ancient
Arabic
Order
of
Nobles
of
the
Mystic
Shrine."
Langdon
was
confused.
He
was
familiar
with
the
Almas
Temple,
but
he
had
forgotten
it
was
on
Franklin
Square.
The
Shriners
are
"The
Order"?
Their
temple
sits
atop
a
secret
staircase?
It
made
no
historical
sense
whatsoever,
but
Langdon
was
in
no
position
at
the
moment
to
debate
history.
"Yes!"
he
shouted.
"That
must
be
it!
The
secret
hides
within
The
Order!"
"You're
familiar
with
the
building?"
"Absolutely!"
Langdon
raised
his
throbbing
head
to
keep
his
ears
above
the
quickly
rising
liquid.
"I
can
help
you!
Let
me
out!"
"So
you
believe
you
can
tell
me
what
this
temple
has
to
do
with
the
symbols
on
the
base
of
the
pyramid?"
"Yes!
Let
me
just
look
at
the
symbols!"
"Very
well,
then.
Let's
see
what
you
come
up
with."
Hurry!
With
the
warm
liquid
rising
around
him,
Langdon
pushed
up
on
the
lid,
willing
the
man
to
unclasp
it.
Please!
Hurry!
But
the
lid
never
opened.
Instead,
the
base
of
the
pyramid
suddenly
appeared,
hovering
above
the
Plexiglas
window.
Langdon
stared
up
in
panic.
"I
trust
this
view
is
close
enough
for
you?"The
man
held
the
pyramid
in
his
tattooed
hands.
"Think
fast,
Professor.
I'm
guessing
you
have
less
than
sixty
seconds."
Robert
Langdon
had
often
heard
it
said
that
an
animal,
when
cornered,
was
capable
of
miraculous
feats
of
strength.
Nonetheless,
when
he
threw
his
full
force
into
the
underside
of
his
crate,
nothing
budged
at
all.
Around
him,
the
liquid
continued
rising
steadily.
With
no
more
than
six
inches
of
breathing
room
left,
Langdon
had
lifted
his
head
into
the
pocket
of
air
that
remained.
He
was
now
face-to-face
with
the
Plexiglas
window,
his
eyes
only
inches
away
from
the
underside
of
the
stone
pyramid
whose
baffling
engraving
hovered
above
him.
/
have
no
idea
what
this
means.
Concealed
for
over
a
century
beneath
a
hardened
mixture
of
wax
and
stone
dust,
the
Masonic
Pyramid's
final
inscription
was
now
laid
bare.
The
engraving
was
a
perfectly
square
grid
of
symbols
from
every
tradition
imaginable
alchemical,
astrological,
heraldic,
angelic,
magical,
numeric,
sigilic,
Greek,
Latin.
As
a
totality,
this
was
symbolic
anarchy
a
bowl
of
alphabet
soup
whose
letters
came
from
dozens
of
different
languages,
cultures,
and
time
periods.
Total
chaos.

Symbologist
Robert
Langdon,
in
his
wildest
academic
interpretations,
could
not
fathom
how
this
grid
of
symbols
could
be
deciphered
to
mean
anything
at
all.
Order
from
this
chaos?
Impossible.
The
liquid
was
now
creeping
over
his
Adam'
s
apple,
and
Langdon
could
feel
his
level
of
terror
rising
along
with
it.
He
continued
banging
on
the
tank.
The
pyramid
stared
back
at
him
tauntingly.
In
frantic
desperation,
Langdon
focused
every
bit
of
his
mental
energy
on
the
chessboard
of
symbols.
What
could
they
possibly
mean?
Unfortunately,
the
assortment
seemed
so
disparate
that
he
could
not
even
imagine
where
to
begin.
They're
not
even
from
the
same
eras
in
history!
Outside
the
tank,
her
voice
muffled
but
audible,
Katherine
could
be
heard
tearfully
begging
for
Langdon'
s
release.
Despite
his
failure
to
see
a
solution,
the
prospect
of
death
seemed
to
motivate
every
cell
in
his
body
to
find
one.
He
felt
a
strange
clarity
of
mind,
unlike
anything
he
had
ever
experienced.
Think!
He
scanned
the
grid
intensely,
searching
for
some
clue
a
pattern,
a
hidden
word,
a
special
icon,
anything
at
all
but
he
saw
only
a
grid
of
unrelated
symbols.
Chaos.
With
each
passing
second,
Langdon
had
begun
to
feel
an
eerie
numbness
overtaking
his
body.
It
was
as
if
his
very
flesh
were
preparing
to
shield
his
mind
from
the
pain
of
death.
The
water
was
now
threatening
to
pour
into
his
ears,
and
he
lifted
his
head
as
far
as
he
could,
pushing
it
against
the
top
of
the
crate.
Frightening
images
began
flashing
before
his
eyes.
A
boy
in
New
England
treading
water
at
the
bottom
of
a
dark
well.
A
man
in
Rome
trapped
beneath
a
skeleton
in
an
overturned
coffin.
Katherine
's
shouts
were
growing
more
frantic.
From
all
Langdon
could
hear,
she
was
trying
to
reason
with
a
madman
insisting
that
Langdon
could
not
be
expected
to
decipher
the
pyramid
without
going
to
visit
the
Almas
Temple.
"That
building
obviously
holds
the
missing
piece
to
this
puzzle!
How
can
Robert
decipher
the
pyramid
without
all
the
information?!"
Langdon
appreciated
her
efforts,
and
yet
he
felt
certain
that
"Eight
Franklin
Square"
was
not
pointing
to
the
Almas
Temple.
The
time
line
is
all
wrong!
According
to
legend,
the
Masonic
Pyramid
was
created
in
the
mid-
1800s,
decades
before
the
Shriners
even
existed.
In
fact,
Langdon
realized,
it
was
probably
before
the
square
was
even
called
Franklin
Square.
The
capstone
could
not
possibly
have
been
pointing
to
an
unbuilt
building
at
a
nonexistent
address.
Whatever
"Eight
Franklin
Square"
was
pointing
to
it
had
to
exist
in
1850.
Unfortunately,
Langdon
was
drawing
a
total
blank.
He
probed
his
memory
banks
for
anything
that
could
possibly
fit
the
time
line.
Eight
Franklin
Square?
Something
that
was
in
existence
in
1850?
Langdon
came
up
with
nothing.
The
liquid
was
trickling
into
his
ears
now.
Fighting
his
terror,
he
stared
up
at
the
grid
of
symbols
on
the
glass.
I
don't
understand
the
connection!
In
a
petrified
frenzy,
his
mind
began
spewing
all
the
far-flung
parallels
it
could
generate.

The
water
kept
rising,
but

blocked
it
out.

Langdon
had
no

Outside
the
tank,
Katherine
was
still
pleading,
but
Langdon'
s
hearing
was
now
intermittent
as
the
water
was
sloshing
around
his
head.
"
impossible
without
knowing
capstone's
message
clearly
the
secret

Then
she
was
gone.
Water
poured
into
Langdon'
s
ears,
blotting
out
the
last
of
Katherine'
s
voice.
A
sudden
womblike
silence
engulfed
him,
and
Langdon
realized
he
truly
was
going
to
die.
The
secret
hides
within
Katherine's
final
words
echoed
through
the
hush
of
his
tomb.
The
secret
hides
within
Strangely,
Langdon
realized
he
had
heard
these
exact
words
many
times
before.
The
secret
hides
within.
Even
now,
it
seemed,
the
Ancient
Mysteries
were
taunting
him.
"The
secret
hides
within"
was
the
core
tenet
of
the
mysteries,
urging
man
kind
to
seek
God
not
in
the
heavens
above
but
rather
within
himself.
The
secret
hides
within.
It
was
the
message
of
all
the
great
mystical
teachers.
The
kingdom
of
God
is
within
you,
said
Jesus
Christ.
Know
thyself,
said
Pythagoras.
Know
ye
not
that
ye
are
gods,
said
Hermes
Trismegistus.
The
list
went
on
and
on
All
the
mystical
teachings
of
the
ages
had
attempted
to
convey
this
one
idea.
The
secret
hides
within.
Even
so,
mankind
continued
looking
to
the
heavens
for
the
face
of
God.
This
realization,
for
Langdon,
now
became
an
ultimate
irony.
Right
now,
with
his
eyes
facing
the
heavens
like
all
the
blind
men
who
preceded
him,
Robert
Langdon
suddenly
saw
the
light.
It
hit
him
like
a
bolt
from
above.
The
secret
hides
within
The
Order
Eight
Franklin
Square
In
a
flash
he
understood.
The
message
on
the
capstone
was
suddenly
crystal
clear.
Its
meaning
had
been
staring
him
in
the
face
all
night.
The
text
on
the
capstone,
like
the
Masonic
Pyramid
itself,
was
a
symbolon
a
code
in
pieces
a
message
written
in
parts.
The
capstone's
meaning
was
camouflaged
in
so
simple
a
manner
that
Langdon
could
scarcely
believe
he
and
Katherine
had
not
spotted
it.
More
astonishing
still,
Langdon
now
realized
that
the
message
on
the
capstone
did
indeed
reveal
exactly
how
to
decipher
the
grid
of
symbols
on
the
base
of
the
pyramid.
It
was
so
very
simple.
Exactly
as
Peter
Solomon
had
promised,
the
golden
capstone
was
a
potent
talisman
with
the
power
to
bring
order
from
chaos.
Langdon
began
pounding
on
the
lid
and
shouting,
"I
know!
I
know!"
Above
him,
the
stone
pyramid
lifted
off
and
hovered
away.
In
its
place,
the
tattooed
face
reappeared,
its
chilling
visage
staring
down
through
the
small
window.
"I
solved
it!"
Langdon
shouted.
"Let
me
out!"
When
the
tattooed
man
spoke,
Langdon's
submerged
ears
heard
nothing.
His
eyes,
however,
saw
the
lips
speak
two
words.
"Tell
me.
"I
will!"
Langdon
screamed,
the
water
almost
to
his
eyes.
"Let
me
out!
I'll
explain
everything!"
It's
so
simple.
The
man's
lips
moved
again.
"Tell
me
now
or
die.
With
the
water
rising
through
the
final
inch
of
air
space,
Langdon
tipped
his
head
back
to
keep
his
mouth
above
the
waterline.
As
he
did
so,
warm
liquid
poured
into
his
eyes,
blurring
his
vision.
Arching
his
back,
he
pressed
his
mouth
against
the
Plexiglas
window.
Then,
with
his
last
few
seconds
of
air,
Robert
Langdon
shared
the
secret
of
how
to
decipher
the
Masonic
Pyramid.
As
he
finished
speaking,
the
liquid
rose
around
his
lips.
Instinctively,
Langdon
drew
a
final
breath
and
clamped
his
mouth
shut.
A
moment
later,
the
fluid
covered
him
entirely,
reaching
the
top
of
his
tomb
and
spreading
out
across
the
Plexiglas.
He
did
it,
Mal'akh
realized.
Langdon
figured
out
how
to
solve
the
pyramid.
The
answer
was
so
simple.
So
obvious.
Beneath
the
window,
the
submerged
face
of
Robert
Langdon
stared
up
at
him
with
desperate
and
beseeching
eyes.
Mal'akh
shook
his
head
at
him
and
slowly
mouthed
the
words:
"Thank
you,
Professor.
Enjoy
the
afterlife."
As
a
serious
swimmer,
Robert
Langdon
had
often
wondered
what
it
would
feel
like
to
drown.
He
now
knew
he
was
going
to
learn
firsthand.
Although
he
could
hold
his
breath
longer
than
most
people,
he
could
already
feel
his
body
reacting
to
the
absence
of
air.
Carbon
dioxide
was
accumulating
in
his
blood,
bringing
with
it
the
instinctual
urge
to
inhale.
Do
not
breathe!
The
reflex
to
inhale
was
increasing
in
intensity
with
each
passing
moment.
Langdon
knew
very
soon
he
would
reach
what
was
called
the
breath-hold
breakpoint
that
critical
moment
at
which
a
person
could
no
longer
voluntarily
hold
his
breath.
Open
the
lid!
Langdon's
instinct
was
to
pound
and
struggle,
but
he
knew
better
than
to
waste
valuable
oxygen.
All
he
could
do
was
stare
up
through
the
blur
of
water
above
him
and
hope.
The
world
outside
was
now
only
a
hazy
patch
of
light
above
the
Plexiglas
window.
His
core
muscles
had
begun
burning,
and
he
knew
hypoxia
was
setting
in.
Suddenly
a
beautiful
and
ghostly
face
appeared,
gazing
down
at
him.
It
was
Katherine,
her
soft
features
looking
almost
ethereal
through
the
veil
of
liquid.
Their
eyes
met
through
the
Plexiglas
window,
and
for
an
instant,
Langdon
thought
he
was
saved.
Katherine!
Then
he
heard
her
muted
cries
of
horror
and
realized
she
was
being
held
there
by
their
captor.
The
tattooed
monster
was
forcing
her
to
bear
witness
to
what
was
about
to
happen.
Katherine,
I'm
sorry
In
this
strange,
dark
place,
trapped
underwater,
Langdon
strained
to
comprehend
that
these
would
be
his
final
moments
of
life.
Soon
he
would
cease
to
exist
everything
he
was
or
had
ever
been
or
would
ever
be
was
ending.
When
his
brain
died,
all
of
the
memories
held
in
his
gray
matter,
along
with
all
of
the
knowledge
he
had
acquired,
would
simply
evaporate
in
a
flood
of
chemical
reactions.
In
this
moment,
Robert
Langdon
realized
his
true
insignificance
in
the
universe.
It
was
as
lonely
and
humbling
a
feeling
as
he
had
ever
experienced.
Almost
thankfully,
he
could
feel
the
breath-hold
breakpoint
arriving.
The
moment
was
upon
him.
Langdon'
s
lungs
forced
out
their
spent
contents,
collapsing
in
eager
preparation
to
inhale.
Still
he
held
out
an
instant
longer.
His
final
second.
Then,
like
a
man
no
longer
able
to
hold
his
hand
to
a
burning
stove,
he
gave
himself
over
to
fate.
Reflex
overruled
reason.
His
lips
parted.
His
lungs
expanded.
And
the
liquid
came
pouring
in.
The
pain
that
filled
his
chest
was
greater
than
Langdon
had
ever
imagined.
The
liquid
burned
as
it
poured
into
his
lungs.
Instantly,
the
pain
shot
upward
into
his
skull,
and
he
felt
like
his
head
was
being
crushed
in
a
vise.
There
was
great
thundering
in
his
ears,
and
through
it
all,
Katherine
Solomon
was
screaming.
There
was
a
blinding
flash
of
light.
And
then
blackness.
Robert
Langdon
was
gone.
It's
over.
Katherine
Solomon
had
stopped
screaming.
The
drowning
she
had
just
witnessed
had
left
her
catatonic,
virtually
paralyzed
with
shock
and
despair.
Beneath
the
Plexiglas
window,
Langdon'
s
dead
eyes
stared
past
her
into
empty
space.
His
frozen
expression
was
one
of
pain
and
regret.
The
last
tiny
air
bubbles
trickled
out
of
his
lifeless
mouth,
and
then,
as
if
consenting
to
give
up
his
ghost,
the
Harvard
professor
slowly
began
sinking
to
the
bottom
of
the
tank
where
he
disappeared
into
the
shadows.
He's
gone.
Katherine
felt
numb.
The
tattooed
man
reached
down,
and
with
pitiless
finality,
he
slid
the
small
viewing
window
closed,
sealing
Langdon'
s
corpse
inside.
Then
he
smiled
at
her.
"Shall
we?"
Before
Katherine
could
respond,
he
hoisted
her
grief-
stricken
body
onto
his
shoulder,
turned
out
the
light,
and
carried
her
out
of
the
room.
With
a
few
powerful
strides,
he
transported
her
to
the
end
of
the
hall,
into
a
large
space
that
seemed
to
be
bathed
in
a
reddish-purple
light.
The
room
smelled
like
incense.
He
carried
her
to
a
square
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
and
dropped
her
hard
on
her
back,
knocking
the
wind
out
of
her.
The
surface
felt
rough
and
cold.
Is
this
stone?
Katherine
had
hardly
gotten
her
bearings
before
the
man
had
removed
the
wire
from
her
wrists
and
ankles.
Instinctively,
she
attempted
to
fight
him
off,
but
her
cramped
arms
and
legs
barely
responded.
He
now
began
strapping
her
to
the
table
with
heavy
leather
bands,
cinching
one
strap
across
her
knees
and
then
buckling
a
second
across
her
hips,
pinning
her
arms
at
her
sides.
Then
he
placed
a
final
strap
across
her
sternum,
just
above
her
breasts.
It
had
all
taken
only
moments,
and
Katherine
was
again
immobilized.
Her
wrists
and
ankles
throbbed
now
as
the
circulation
returned
to
her
limbs.
"Open
your
mouth,"
the
man
whispered,
licking
his
own
tattooed
lips.
Katherine
clenched
her
teeth
in
revulsion.
The
man
again
reached
out
with
his
index
finger
and
ran
it
slowly
around
her
lips,
making
her
skin
crawl.
She
clenched
her
teeth
tighter.
The
tattooed
man
chuckled
and,
using
his
other
hand,
found
a
pressure
point
on
her
neck
and
squeezed.
Katherine'
s
jaw
instantly
dropped
open.
She
could
feel
his
finger
entering
her
mouth
and
running
along
her
tongue.
She
gagged
and
tried
to
bite
it,
but
the
finger
was
already
gone.
Still
grinning,
he
raised
his
moist
fingertip
before
her
eyes.
Then
he
closed
his
eyes
and,
once
again,
rubbed
her
saliva
into
the
bare
circle
of
flesh
on
his
head.
The
man
sighed
and
slowly
opened
his
eyes.
Then,
with
an
eerie
calm,
he
turned
and
left
the
room.
In
the
sudden
silence,
Katherine
could
feel
her
heart
pounding.
Directly
over
her,
an
unusual
series
of
lights
seemed
to
be
modulating
from
purple
red
to
a
deep
crimson,
illuminating
the
room's
low
ceiling.
When
she
saw
the
ceiling,
all
she
could
do
was
stare.
Every
inch
was
covered
with
drawings.
The
mind-boggling
collage
above
her
appeared
to
depict
the
celestial
sky.
Stars,
planets,
and
constellations
mingled
with
astrological
symbols,
charts,
and
formulas.
There
were
arrows
predicting
elliptical
orbits,
geometric
symbols
indicating
angles
of
ascension,
and
zodiacal
creatures
peering
down
at
her.
It
looked
like
a
mad
scientist
had
gotten
loose
in
the
Sistine
Chapel.
Turning
her
head,
Katherine
looked
away,
but
the
wall
to
her
left
was
no
better.
A
series
of
candles
on
medieval
floor
stands
shed
a
flickering
glow
on
a
wall
that
was
completely
hidden
beneath
pages
of
text,
photos,
and
drawings.
Some
of
the
pages
looked
like
papyrus
or
vellum
torn
from
ancient
books;
others
were
obviously
from
newer
texts;
mixed
in
were
photographs,
drawings,
maps,
and
schematics;
all
of
them
appeared
to
have
been
glued
to
the
wall
with
meticulous
care.
A
spiderweb
of
strings
had
been
thumbtacked
across
them,
interconnecting
them
in
limitless
chaotic
possibilities.
Katherine
again
looked
away,
turning
her
head
in
the
other
direction.
Unfortunately,
this
provided
the
most
terrifying
view
of
all.
Adjacent
to
the
stone
slab
on
which
she
was
strapped,
there
stood
a
small
side
counter
that
instantly
reminded
her
of
an
instrument
table
from
a
hospital
operating
room.
On
the
counter
was
arranged
a
series
of
objects
among
them
a
syringe,
a
vial
of
dark
liquid
and
a
large
knife
with
a
bone
handle
and
a
blade
hewn
of
iron
burnished
to
an
unusually
high
shine.
My
God
what
is
he
planning
to
do
to
me?
When
CIA
systems
security
specialist
Rick
Parrish
finally
loped
into
Nola
Kaye's
office,
he
was
carrying
a
single
sheet
of
paper.
"What
took
you
so
long?!"
Nola
demanded.
/
told
you
to
come
down
immediately!
"Sorry,"
he
said,
pushing
up
his
bottle-bottom
glasses
on
his
long
nose.
"I
was
trying
to
gather
more
information
for
you,
but
"Just
show
me
what
you've
got."
Parrish
handed
her
the
printout.
"It's
a
redaction,
but
you
get
the
gist."
Nola
scanned
the
page
in
amazement.
"I'm
still
trying
to
figure
out
how
a
hacker
got
access,"
Parrish
said,
"but
it
looks
like
a
delegator
spider
hijacked
one
of
our
search
"Forget
thatV
Nola
blurted,
glancing
up
from
the
page.
"What
the
hell
is
the
CIA
doing
with
a
classified
file
about
pyramids,
ancient
portals,
and
engraved
symbolons?"
"That's
what
took
me
so
long.
I
was
trying
to
see
what
document
was
being
targeted,
so
I
traced
the
file
path."
Parrish
paused,
clearing
his
throat.
"This
document
turns
out
to
be
on
a
partition
personally
assigned
to
the
CIA
director
himself."
Nola
wheeled,
staring
in
disbelief.
Sato
's
boss
has
a
file
about
the
Masonic
Pyramid?
She
knew
that
the
current
director,
along
with
many
other
top
CIA
executives,
was
a
high-ranking
Mason,
but
Nola
could
not
imagine
any
of
them
keeping
Masonic
secrets
on
a
CIA
computer.
Then
again,
considering
what
she
had
witnessed
in
the
last
twenty-four
hours,
anything
was
possible.
Agent
Simkins
was
lying
on
his
stomach,
ensconced
in
the
bushes
of
Franklin
Square.
His
eyes
were
trained
on
the
columned
entry
of
the
Almas
Temple.
Nothing.
No
lights
had
come
on
inside,
and
no
one
had
approached
the
door.
He
turned
his
head
and
checked
on
Bellamy.
The
man
was
pacing
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
park,
looking
cold.
Really
cold.
Simkins
could
see
him
shaking
and
shivering.
His
phone
vibrated.
It
was
Sato.
"How
overdue
is
our
target?"
she
demanded.
Simkins
checked
his
chronograph.
"Target
said
twenty
minutes.
It's
been
almost
forty.
Something's
wrong."
"He's
not
coming,"
Sato
said.
"It's
over."
Simkins
knew
she
was
right.
"Any
word
from
Hartmann?"
"No,
he
never
checked
in
from
Kalorama
Heights.
I
can't
reach
him."
Simkins
stiffened.
If
this
was
true,
then
something
was
definitely
wrong.
"I
just
called
field
support,"
Sato
said,
"and
they
can't
find
him
either."
Holy
shit.
"Do
they
have
a
GPS
location
on
the
Escalade?"
"Yeah.
A
residential
address
in
Kalorama
Heights,"
Sato
said.
"Gather
your
men.
We're
pulling
out."
Sato
clicked
off
her
phone
and
gazed
out
at
the
majestic
skyline
of
her
nation's
capital.
An
icy
wind
whipped
through
her
light
jacket,
and
she
wrapped
her
arms
around
herself
to
stay
warm.
Director
Inoue
Sato
was
not
a
woman
who
often
felt
cold
or
fear.
At
the
moment,
however,
she
was
feeling
both.
Mal'akh
wore
only
his
silk
loincloth
as
he
dashed
up
the
ramp,
through
the
steel
door,
and
out
through
the
painting
into
his
living
room.
/
need
to
prepare
quickly.
He
glanced
over
at
the
dead
CIA
agent
in
the
foyer.
This
home
is
no
longer
safe.
Carrying
the
stone
pyramid
in
one
hand,
Mal'akh
strode
directly
to
his
first-floor
study
and
sat
down
at
his
laptop
computer.
As
he
logged
in,
he
pictured
Langdon
downstairs
and
wondered
how
many
days
or
even
weeks
would
pass
before
the
submerged
corpse
was
discovered
in
the
secret
basement.
It
made
no
difference.
Mal'akh
would
be
long
gone
by
then.
Langdon
has
served
his
role
brilliantly.
Not
only
had
Langdon
reunited
the
pieces
of
the
Masonic
Pyramid,
he
had
figured
out
how
to
solve
the
arcane
grid
of
symbols
on
the
base.
At
first
glance,
the
symbols
seemed
indecipherable
and
yet
the
answer
was
simple
staring
them
in
the
face.
Mal'akh's
laptop
sprang
to
life,
the
screen
displaying
the
same
e-mail
he
had
received
earlier
a
photograph
of
a
glowing
capstone,
partially
blocked
by
Warren
Bellamy's
finger.
The
secret
hides
within
The
Order.
Franklin
Square.
Eight
Franklin
Square,
Katherine
had
told
Mal'akh.
She
had
also
admitted
that
CIA
agents
were
staking
out
Franklin
Square,
hoping
to
capture
Mal'akh
and
also
figure
out
what
order
was
being
referenced
by
the
capstone.
The
Masons?
The
Shriners?
The
Rosicrucians?
None
of
these,
Mal'akh
now
knew.
Langdon
saw
the
truth.
Ten
minutes
earlier,
with
liquid
rising
around
his
face,
the
Harvard
professor
had
figured
out
the
key
to
solving
the
pyramid.
"The
Order
Eight
Franklin
Square!"
he
had
shouted,
terror
in
his
eyes.
"The
secret
hides
within
The
Order
Eight
Franklin
Square!"
At
first,
Mal'akh
failed
to
understand
his
meaning.
"It's
not
an
address!"
Langdon
yelled,
his
mouth
pressed
to
the
Plexiglas
window.
"The
Order
Eight
Franklin
Square!
It's
a
magic
square!"
Then
he
said
something
about
Albrecht
Diirer
and
how
the
pyramid's
first
code
was
a
clue
to
breaking
this
final
one.
Mal'akh
was
familiar
with
magic
squares
kameas,
as
the
early
mystics
called
them.
The
ancient
text
De
Occulta
Philosophia
described
in
detail
the
mystical
power
of
magic
squares
and
the
methods
for
designing
powerful
sigils
based
on
magical
grids
of
numbers.
Now
Langdon
was
telling
him
that
a
magic
square
held
the
key
to
deciphering
the
base
of
the
pyramid?
"You
need
an
eight-by-eight
magic
square!"
the
professor
had
been
yelling,
his
lips
the
only
part
of
his
body
above
the
liquid.
"Magic
squares
are
categorized
in
ordersl
A
three-by-three
square
is
an
'order
three'
!
A
four-by-four
square
is
an
'order
four'
!
You
need
an
'order
eight'
!"
The
liquid
had
been
about
to
engulf
Langdon
entirely,
and
the
professor
drew
one
last
desperate
breath
and
shouted
out
something
about
a
famous
Mason
an
American
forefather
a
scientist,
mystic,
mathematician,
inventor
as
well
as
the
creator
of
the
mystical
kamea
that
bore
his
name
to
this
day.
Franklin.
In
a
flash,
Mal'akh
knew
Langdon
was
right.
Now,
breathless
with
anticipation,
Mal'akh
sat
upstairs
at
his
laptop.
He
ran
a
quick
Web
search,
received
dozens
of
hits,
chose
one,
and
began
reading.
THE
ORDER
EIGHT
FRANKLIN
SQUARE
One
of
history's
best-known
magic
squares
is
the
order-eight
square
published
in
1769
by
American
scientist
Benjamin
Franklin,
and
which
became
famous
for
its
inclusion
of
never-bef
ore-
seen
"bent
diagonal
summations."
Franklin's
obsession
with
this
mystical
art
form
most
likely
stemmed
from
his
personal
associations
with
the
prominent
alchemists
and
mystics
of
his
day,
as
well
as
his
own
belief
in
astrology,
which
were
the
underpinnings
for
the
predictions
made
in
his
Poor
Richard's
Almanack.

Mal'akh
studied
Franklin's
famous
creation
a
unique
arrangement
of
the
numbers
1
through
64
in
which
every
row,
column,
and
diagonal
added
up
to
the
same
magical
constant.
The
secret
hides
within
The
Order
Eight
Franklin
Square.
Mal'akh
smiled.
Trembling
with
excitement,
he
grabbed
the
stone
pyramid
and
flipped
it
over,
examining
the
base.

These
sixty-four
symbols
needed
to
be
reorganized
and
arranged
in
a
different
order,
their
sequence
defined
by
the
numbers
in
Franklin's
magic
square.
Although
Mal'akh
could
not
imagine
how
this
chaotic
grid
of
symbols
would
suddenly
make
sense
in
a
different
order,
he
had
faith
in
the
ancient
promise.
Ordo
ab
chao.
Heart
racing,
he
took
out
a
sheet
of
paper
and
quickly
drew
an
empty
eight-by-eight
grid.
Then
he
began
inserting
the
symbols,
one
by
one,
in
their
newly
defined
positions.
Almost
immediately,
to
his
astonishment,
the
grid
began
making
sense.
Order
from
chaos!
He
completed
the
entire
decryption
and
stared
in
disbelief
at
the
solution
before
him.
A
stark
image
had
taken
shape.
The
jumbled
grid
had
been
transformed
reorganized
and
although
Mal'akh
could
not
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
entire
message,
he
understood
enough
enough
to
know
exactly
where
he
was
now
headed.
The
pyramid
points
the
way.
The
grid
pointed
to
one
of
the
world's
great
mystical
locations.
Incredibly,
it
was
the
same
location
at
which
Mal'akh
had
always
fantasized
he
would
complete
his
journey.
Destiny.
The
stone
table
felt
cold
beneath
Katherine
Solomon's
back.
Horrifying
images
of
Robert's
death
continued
to
swirl
through
her
mind,
along
with
thoughts
of
her
brother.
Is
Peter
dead,
too
?
The
strange
knife
on
the
nearby
table
kept
bringing
flashes
of
what
might
lie
in
store
for
her
as
well.
Is
this
really
the
end?
Oddly,
her
thoughts
turned
abruptly
to
her
research
to
Noetic
Science
and
to
her
recent
breakthroughs.
All
of
it
lost
up
in
smoke.
She
would
never
be
able
to
share
with
the
world
everything
she
had
learned.
Her
most
shocking
discovery
had
taken
place
only
a
few
months
ago,
and
the
results
had
the
potential
to
redefine
the
way
humans
thought
about
death.
Strangely,
thinking
now
of
that
experiment
was
bringing
her
an
unexpected
solace.
As
a
young
girl,
Katherine
Solomon
had
often
wondered
if
there
was
life
after
death.
Does
heaven
exist?
What
happens
when
we
die
?
As
she
grew
older,
her
studies
in
science
quickly
erased
any
fanciful
notions
of
heaven,
hell,
or
the
afterlife.
The
concept
of
"life
after
death,"
she
came
to
accept,
was
a
human
construct
a
fairy
tale
designed
to
soften
the
horrifying
truth
that
was
our
mortality.
Or
so
I
believed
A
year
ago,
Katherine
and
her
brother
had
been
discussing
one
of
philosophy's
most
enduring
questions
the
existence
of
the
human
soul
specifically
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
humans
possessed
some
kind
of
consciousness
capable
of
survival
outside
of
the
body.
They
both
sensed
that
such
a
human
soul
probably
did
exist.
Most
ancient
philosophies
concurred.
Buddhist
and
Brahminical
wisdom
endorsed
metempsychosis
the
transmigration
of
the
soul
into
a
new
body
after
death;
Platonists
defined
the
body
as
a
"prison"
from
which
the
soul
escaped;
and
the
Stoics
called
the
soul
apospasma
tou
theu
"a
particle
of
God"
and
believed
it
was
recalled
by
God
upon
death.
The
existence
of
the
human
soul,
Katherine
noted
with
some
frustration,
was
probably
a
concept
that
would
never
be
scientifically
proven.
Confirming
that
a
consciousness
survived
outside
the
human
body
after
death
was
akin
to
exhaling
a
puff
of
smoke
and
hoping
to
find
it
years
later.
After
their
discussion,
Katherine
had
a
strange
notion.
Her
brother
had
mentioned
the
Book
of
Genesis
and
its
description
of
the
soul
as
Neshemah
a
kind
of
spiritual
"intelligence"
that
was
separate
from
the
body.
It
occurred
to
Katherine
that
the
word
intelligence
suggested
the
presence
of
thought.
Noetic
Science
clearly
suggested
that
thoughts
had
mass,
and
so
it
stood
to
reason,
then,
that
the
human
soul
might
therefore
also
have
mass.
Can
I
weigh
a
human
soul?
The
notion
was
impossible,
of
course
foolish
even
to
ponder.
It
was
three
days
later
that
Katherine
suddenly
woke
up
from
a
dead
sleep
and
sat
bolt
upright
in
bed.
She
jumped
up,
drove
to
her
lab,
and
immediately
began
work
designing
an
experiment
that
was
both
startlingly
simple
and
frighteningly
bold.
She
had
no
idea
if
it
would
work,
and
she
decided
not
to
tell
Peter
about
her
idea
until
her
work
was
complete.
It
took
four
months,
but
finally
Katherine
brought
her
brother
into
the
lab.
She
wheeled
out
a
large
piece
of
gear
that
she
had
been
keeping
hidden
in
the
back
storage
room.
"I
designed
and
built
it
myself,"
she
said,
showing
Peter
her
invention.
"Any
guesses?"
Her
brother
stared
at
the
strange
machine.
"An
incubator?"
Katherine
laughed
and
shook
her
head,
although
it
was
a
reasonable
guess.
The
machine
did
look
a
bit
like
the
transparent
incubators
for
premature
babies
one
saw
in
hospitals.
This
machine,
however,
was
adult
size
a
long,
airtight,
clear
plastic
capsule,
like
some
kind
of
futuristic
sleeping
pod.
It
sat
atop
a
large
piece
of
electronic
gear.
"See
if
this
helps
you
guess,"
Katherine
said,
plugging
the
contraption
into
a
power
source.
A
digital
display
lit
up
on
the
machine,
its
numbers
jumping
around
as
she
carefully
calibrated
some
dials.
When
she
was
done,
the
display
read:
0.0000000000
kg
"A
scale?"
Peter
asked,
looking
puzzled.
"Not
just
any
scale."
Katherine
took
a
tiny
scrap
of
paper
off
a
nearby
counter
and
laid
it
gently
on
top
of
the
capsule.
The
numbers
on
the
display
jumped
around
again
and
then
settled
on
a
new
reading.
.0008194325
kg
"High-precision
microbalance,"
she
said.
"Resolution
down
to
a
few
micrograms."
Peter
still
looked
puzzled.
"You
built
a
precise
scale
for
a
person?"
"Exactly."
She
lifted
the
transparent
lid
on
the
machine.
"If
I
place
a
person
inside
this
capsule
and
close
the
lid,
the
individual
is
in
an
entirely
sealed
system.
Nothing
gets
in
or
out.
No
gas,
no
liquid,
no
dust
particles.
Nothing
can
escape
not
the
person's
breath
exhalations,
evaporating
sweat,
body
fluids,
nothing."
Peter
ran
a
hand
through
his
thick
head
of
silver
hair,
a
nervous
mannerism
shared
by
Katherine.
"Hmm
obviously
a
person
would
die
in
there
pretty
quickly."
She
nodded.
"Six
minutes
or
so,
depending
on
their
breathing
rate."
He
turned
to
her.
"I
don't
get
it."
She
smiled.
"You
will"
Leaving
the
machine
behind,
Katherine
led
Peter
into
the
Cube's
control
room
and
sat
him
down
in
front
of
the
plasma
wall.
She
began
typing
and
accessed
a
series
of
video
files
stored
on
the
holographic
drives.
When
the
plasma
wall
flickered
to
life,
the
image
before
them
looked
like
home-
video
footage.
The
camera
panned
across
a
modest
bedroom
with
an
unmade
bed,
medication
bottles,
a
respirator,
and
a
heart
monitor.
Peter
looked
baffled
as
the
camera
kept
panning
and
finally
revealed,
near
the
center
of
the
bedroom,
Katherine'
s
scale
contraption.
Peter's
eyes
widened.
"What
the
?"
The
capsule's
transparent
lid
was
open,
and
a
very
old
man
in
an
oxygen
mask
lay
inside.
His
elderly
wife
and
a
hospice
worker
stood
beside
the
pod.
The
man's
breathing
was
labored,
and
his
eyes
were
closed.
"The
man
in
the
capsule
was
a
science
teacher
of
mine
at
Yale,"
Katherine
said.
"He
and
I
have
kept
in
touch
over
the
years.
He's
been
very
ill.
He
always
said
he
wanted
to
donate
his
body
to
science,
so
when
I
explained
my
idea
for
this
experiment,
he
immediately
wanted
to
be
a
part
of
it."
Peter
was
apparently
mute
with
shock
as
he
stared
at
the
scene
unfolding
before
them.
The
hospice
worker
now
turned
to
the
man's
wife.
"It's
time.
He's
ready."
The
old
woman
dabbed
her
tearful
eyes
and
nodded
with
a
resolute
calm.
"Okay."
Very
gently,
the
hospice
worker
reached
into
the
pod
and
removed
the
man's
oxygen
mask.
The
man
stirred
slightly,
but
his
eyes
remained
closed.
Now
the
worker
wheeled
the
respirator
and
other
equipment
off
to
the
side,
leaving
the
old
man
in
the
capsule
totally
isolated
in
the
center
of
the
room.
The
dying
man's
wife
now
approached
the
pod,
leaned
down,
and
gently
kissed
her
husband's
forehead.
The
old
man
did
not
open
his
eyes,
but
his
lips
moved,
ever
so
slightly,
into
a
faint,
loving
smile.
Without
his
oxygen
mask,
the
man's
breathing
was
quickly
becoming
more
labored.
The
end
was
obviously
near.
With
an
admirable
strength
and
calm,
the
man's
wife
slowly
lowered
the
transparent
lid
of
the
capsule
and
sealed
it
shut,
exactly
as
Katherine
had
taught
her.
Peter
recoiled
in
alarm.
"Katherine,
what
in
the
name
of
God?!"
"It's
okay,"
Katherine
whispered.
"There's
plenty
of
air
in
the
capsule."
She
had
seen
this
video
dozens
of
times
now,
but
it
still
made
her
pulse
race.
She
pointed
to
the
scale
beneath
the
dying
man's
sealed
pod.
The
digital
numbers
read:
51.4534644
kg
"That's
his
body
weight,"
Katherine
said.
The
old
man's
breathing
became
more
shallow,
and
Peter
inched
forward,
transfixed.
"This
is
what
he
wanted,"
Katherine
whispered.
"Watch
what
happens."
The
man's
wife
had
stepped
back
and
was
now
seated
on
the
bed,
silently
looking
on
with
the
hospice
worker.
Over
the
course
of
the
next
sixty
seconds,
the
man's
shallow
breathing
grew
faster,
until
all
at
once,
as
if
the
man
himself
had
chosen
the
moment,
he
simply
took
his
last
breath.
Everything
stopped.
It
was
over.
The
wife
and
hospice
worker
quietly
comforted
each
other.
Nothing
else
happened.
After
a
few
seconds,
Peter
glanced
over
at
Katherine
in
apparent
confusion.
Wait
for
it,
she
thought,
redirecting
Peter's
gaze
to
the
capsule's
digital
display,
which
still
quietly
glowed,
showing
the
dead
man's
weight.
Then
it
happened.
When
Peter
saw
it,
he
jolted
backward,
almost
falling
out
of
his
chair.
"But
that's"
He
covered
his
mouth
in
shock.
"I
can't"
It
was
seldom
that
the
great
Peter
Solomon
was
speechless.
Katherine's
reaction
had
been
similar
the
first
few
times
she
saw
what
had
happened.
Moments
after
the
man's
death,
the
numbers
on
the
scale
had
decreased
suddenly.
The
man
had
become
lighter
immediately
after
his
death.
The
weight
change
was
minuscule,
but
it
was
measurable
and
the
implications
were
utterly
mind-boggling.
Katherine
recalled
writing
in
her
lab
notes
with
a
trembling
hand:
"There
seems
to
exist
an
invisible
'material'
that
exits
the
human
body
at
the
moment
of
death.
It
has
quantifiable
mass
which
is
unimpeded
by
physical
barriers.
I
must
assume
it
moves
in
a
dimension
I
cannot
yet
perceive."
From
the
expression
of
shock
on
her
brother's
face,
Katherine
knew
he
understood
the
implications.
"Katherine"
he
stammered,
blinking
his
gray
eyes
as
if
to
make
sure
he
was
not
dreaming.
"I
think
you
just
weighed
the
human
soul."
There
was
a
long
silence
between
them.
Katherine
sensed
that
her
brother
was
attempting
to
process
all
the
stark
and
wondrous
ramifications.
It
will
take
time.
If
what
they
had
just
witnessed
was
indeed
what
it
seemed
to
be
that
is,
evidence
that
a
soul
or
consciousness
or
life
force
could
move
outside
the
realm
of
the
body
then
a
startling
new
light
had
just
been
shed
on
countless
mystical
questions:
transmigration,
cosmic
consciousness,
near-death
experiences,
astral
projection,
remote
viewing,
lucid
dreaming,
and
on
and
on.
Medical
journals
were
filled
with
stories
of
patients
who
had
died
on
the
operating
table,
viewed
their
bodies
from
above,
and
then
been
brought
back
to
life.
Peter
was
silent,
and
Katherine
now
saw
he
had
tears
in
his
eyes.
She
understood.
She
had
cried,
too.
Peter
and
Katherine
had
lost
loved
ones,
and
for
anyone
in
that
position,
the
faintest
hint
of
the
human
spirit
continuing
after
death
brought
a
glimmer
of
hope.
He's
thinking
ofZachary,
Katherine
thought,
recognizing
the
deep
melancholy
in
her
brother's
eyes.
For
years
Peter
had
carried
the
burden
of
responsibility
for
his
son's
death.
He
had
told
Katherine
many
times
that
leaving
Zachary
in
prison
had
been
the
worst
mistake
of
his
life,
and
that
he
would
never
find
a
way
to
forgive
himself.
A
slamming
door
drew
Katherine's
attention,
and
suddenly
she
was
back
in
the
basement,
lying
on
a
cold
stone
table.
The
metal
door
at
the
top
of
the
ramp
had
closed
loudly,
and
the
tattooed
man
was
coming
back
down.
She
could
hear
him
entering
one
of
the
rooms
down
the
hall,
doing
something
inside,
and
then
continuing
along
the
hall
toward
the
room
she
was
in.
As
he
entered,
she
could
see
that
he
was
pushing
something
in
front
of
him.
Something
heavy
on
wheels.
As
he
stepped
into
the
light,
she
stared
in
disbelief.
The
tattooed
man
was
pushing
a
person
in
a
wheelchair.
Intellectually,
Katherine's
brain
recognized
the
man
in
the
chair.
Emotionally,
her
mind
could
barely
accept
what
she
was
looking
at.
Peter?
She
didn't
know
whether
to
be
overjoyed
that
her
brother
was
alive
or
utterly
horrified.
Peter's
body
had
been
shaved
smooth.
His
mane
of
thick
silver
hair
was
all
gone,
as
were
his
eyebrows,
and
his
smooth
skin
glistened
as
if
it
had
been
oiled.
He
wore
a
black
silk
gown.
Where
his
right
hand
should
have
been,
he
had
only
a
stump,
wrapped
in
a
clean,
fresh
bandage.
Her
brother's
pain-laden
eyes
reached
out
to
hers,
filled
with
regret
and
sorrow.
"Peter!"
Her
voice
cracked.
Her
brother
tried
to
speak
but
made
only
muffled,
guttural
noises.
Katherine
now
realized
he
was
bound
to
the
wheelchair
and
had
been
gagged.
The
tattooed
man
reached
down
and
gently
stroked
Peter's
shaved
scalp.
"I've
prepared
your
brother
for
a
great
honor.
He
has
a
role
to
play
tonight."
Katherine's
entire
body
went
rigid.
No
"Peter
and
I
will
be
leaving
in
a
moment,
but
I
thought
you'd
want
to
say
good-bye."
"Where
are
you
taking
him?"
she
said
weakly.
He
smiled.
"Peter
and
I
must
journey
to
the
sacred
mountain.
That
is
where
the
treasure
lies.
The
Masonic
Pyramid
has
revealed
the
location.
Your
friend
Robert
Langdon
was
most
helpful."
Katherine
looked
into
her
brother's
eyes.
"He
killed
Robert."
Her
brother's
expression
contorted
in
agony,
and
he
shook
his
head
violently,
as
if
unable
to
bear
any
more
pain.
"Now,
now,
Peter,"
the
man
said,
again
stroking
Peter's
scalp.
"Don't
let
this
ruin
the
moment.
Say
good-bye
to
your
little
sister.
This
is
your
final
family
reunion."
Katherine
felt
her
mind
welling
with
desperation.
"Why
are
you
doing
this?!"
she
shouted
at
him.
"What
have
we
ever
done
to
you?!
Why
do
you
hate
my
family
so
much?!"
The
tattooed
man
came
over
and
placed
his
mouth
right
next
to
her
ear.
"I
have
my
reasons,
Katherine."
Then
he
walked
to
the
side
table
and
picked
up
the
strange
knife.
He
brought
it
over
to
her
and
ran
the
burnished
blade
across
her
cheek.
"This
is
arguably
the
most
famous
knife
in
history."
Katherine
knew
of
no
famous
knives,
but
it
looked
foreboding
and
ancient.
The
blade
felt
razor
sharp.
"Don't
worry,"
he
said.
"I
have
no
intention
of
wasting
its
power
on
you.
I'm
saving
it
for
a
more
worthy
sacrifice
in
a
more
sacred
place."
He
turned
to
her
brother.
"Peter,
you
recognize
this
knife,
don't
you?"
Her
brother's
eyes
were
wide
with
a
mixture
of
fear
and
disbelief.
"Yes,
Peter,
this
ancient
artifact
still
exists.
I
obtained
it
at
great
expense
and
I
have
been
saving
it
for
you.
At
long
last,
you
and
I
can
end
our
painful
journey
together."
With
that,
he
wrapped
the
knife
carefully
in
a
cloth
with
all
of
his
other
items
incense,
vials
of
liquid,
white
satin
cloths,
and
other
ceremonial
objects.
He
then
placed
the
wrapped
items
inside
Robert
Langdon'
s
leather
bag
along
with
the
Masonic
Pyramid
and
capstone.
Katherine
looked
on
helplessly
as
the
man
zipped
up
Langdon'
s
daybag
and
turned
to
her
brother.
"Carry
this,
Peter,
would
you?"
He
set
the
heavy
bag
on
Peter's
lap.
Next,
the
man
walked
over
to
a
drawer
and
began
rooting
around.
She
could
hear
small
metal
objects
clinking.
When
he
returned,
he
took
her
right
arm,
steadying
it.
Katherine
couldn't
see
what
he
was
doing,
but
Peter
apparently
could,
and
he
again
started
bucking
wildly.
Katherine
felt
a
sudden,
sharp
pinch
in
the
crook
of
her
right
elbow,
and
an
eerie
warmth
ran
down
around
it.
Peter
was
making
anguished,
strangled
sounds
and
trying
in
vain
to
get
out
of
the
heavy
chair.
Katherine
felt
a
cold
numbness
spreading
through
her
forearm
and
fingertips
below
the
elbow.
When
the
man
stepped
aside,
Katherine
saw
why
her
brother
was
so
horrified.
The
tattooed
man
had
inserted
a
medical
needle
into
her
vein,
as
if
she
were
giving
blood.
The
needle,
however,
was
not
attached
to
a
tube.
Instead,
her
blood
was
now
flowing
freely
out
of
it
running
down
her
elbow,
forearm,
and
onto
the
stone
table.
"A
human
hourglass,"
the
man
said,
turning
to
Peter.
"In
a
short
while,
when
I
ask
you
to
play
your
role,
I
want
you
to
picture
Katherine
dying
alone
here
in
the
dark."
Peter's
expression
was
one
of
total
torment.
"She
will
stay
alive,"
the
man
said,
"for
about
an
hour
or
so.
If
you
cooperate
with
me
quickly,
I
will
have
enough
time
to
save
her.
Of
course,
if
you
resist
me
at
all
your
sister
will
die
here
alone
in
the
dark."
Peter
bellowed
unintelligibly
through
his
gag.
"I
know,
I
know,"
the
tattooed
man
said,
placing
a
hand
on
Peter's
shoulder,
"this
is
hard
for
you.
But
it
shouldn't
be.
After
all,
this
is
not
the
first
time
you
will
abandon
a
family
member."
He
paused,
bending
over
and
whispering
in
Peter's
ear.
"I'm
thinking,
of
course,
of
your
son,
Zachary,
in
Soganlik
prison."
Peter
pulled
against
his
restraints
and
let
out
another
muffled
scream
through
the
cloth
in
his
mouth.
"Stop
it!"
Katherine
shouted.
"I
remember
that
night
well,"
the
man
taunted
as
he
finished
packing.
"I
heard
the
whole
thing.
The
warden
offered
to
let
your
son
go,
but
you
chose
to
teach
Zachary
a
lesson
by
abandoning
him.
Your
boy
learned
his
lesson,
all
right,
didn't
he?"
The
man
smiled.
"His
loss
was
my
gain."
The
man
now
retrieved
a
linen
cloth
and
stuffed
it
deep
into
Katherine'
s
mouth.
"Death,"
he
whispered
to
her,
"should
be
a
quiet
thing."
Peter
struggled
violently.
Without
another
word,
the
tattooed
man
slowly
backed
Peter's
wheelchair
out
of
the
room,
giving
Peter
a
long,
last
look
at
his
sister.
Katherine
and
Peter
locked
eyes
one
final
time.
Then
he
was
gone.
Katherine
could
hear
them
going
up
the
ramp
and
through
the
metal
door.
As
they
exited,
she
heard
the
tattooed
man
lock
the
metal
door
behind
him
and
continue
on
through
the
painting
of
the
Three
Graces.
A
few
minutes
later,
she
heard
a
car
start.
Then
the
mansion
fell
silent.
All
alone
in
the
dark,
Katherine
lay
bleeding.
Robert
Langdon's
mind
hovered
in
an
endless
abyss.
No
light.
No
sound.
No
feeling.
Only
an
infinite
and
silent
void.
Softness.
Weightlessness.
His
body
had
released
him.
He
was
untethered.
The
physical
world
had
ceased
to
exist.
Time
had
ceased
to
exist.
He
was
pure
consciousness
now
a
fleshless
sentience
suspended
in
the
emptiness
of
a
vast
universe.
The
modified
UH-60
skimmed
in
low
over
the
expansive
rooftops
of
Kalorama
Heights,
thundering
toward
the
coordinates
given
to
them
by
the
support
team.
Agent
Simkins
was
the
first
to
spot
the
black
Escalade
parked
haphazardly
on
a
lawn
in
front
of
one
of
the
mansions.
The
driveway
gate
was
closed,
and
the
house
was
dark
and
quiet.
Sato
gave
the
signal
to
touch
down.
The
aircraft
landed
hard
on
the
front
lawn
amid
several
other
vehicles
one
of
them
a
security
sedan
with
a
bubble
light
on
top.
Simkins
and
his
team
jumped
out,
drew
their
weapons,
and
dashed
up
onto
the
porch.
Finding
the
front
door
locked,
Simkins
cupped
his
hands
and
peered
through
a
window.
The
foyer
was
dark,
but
Simkins
could
make
out
the
faint
shadow
of
a
body
on
the
floor.
"Shit,"
he
whispered.
"It's
Hartmann."
One
of
his
agents
grabbed
a
chair
off
the
porch
and
heaved
it
through
the
bay
window.
The
sound
of
shattering
glass
was
barely
audible
over
the
roar
of
the
helicopter
behind
them.
Seconds
later,
they
were
all
inside.
Simkins
rushed
to
the
foyer
and
knelt
over
Hartmann
to
check
his
pulse.
Nothing.
There
was
blood
everywhere.
Then
he
saw
the
screwdriver
in
Hartmann'
s
throat.
Jesus.
He
stood
up
and
motioned
to
his
men
to
begin
a
full
search.
The
agents
fanned
out
across
the
first
floor,
their
laser
sights
probing
the
darkness
of
the
luxurious
house.
They
found
nothing
in
the
living
room
or
study,
but
in
the
dining
room,
to
their
surprise,
they
discovered
a
strangled
female
security
guard.
Simkins
was
fast
losing
hope
that
Robert
Langdon
and
Katherine
Solomon
were
alive.
This
brutal
killer
clearly
had
set
a
trap,
and
if
he
had
managed
to
kill
a
CIA
agent
and
an
armed
security
guard,
then
it
seemed
a
professor
and
a
scientist
had
no
chance.
Once
the
first
floor
was
secure,
Simkins
sent
two
agents
to
search
upstairs.
Meanwhile,
he
found
a
set
of
basement
stairs
off
the
kitchen
and
descended.
At
the
bottom
of
the
stairs,
he
threw
on
the
lights.
The
basement
was
spacious
and
spotless,
as
if
it
were
hardly
ever
used.
Boilers,
bare
cement
walls,
a
few
boxes.
Nothing
here
at
all.
Simkins
headed
back
up
to
the
kitchen
just
as
his
men
were
coming
down
from
the
second
floor.
Everyone
shook
their
heads.
The
house
was
deserted.
No
one
home.
And
no
more
bodies.
Simkins
radioed
Sato
with
the
all-clear
and
the
grim
update.
When
he
got
to
the
foyer,
Sato
was
already
climbing
the
stairs
onto
the
porch.
Warren
Bellamy
was
visible
behind
her,
sitting
dazed
and
alone
in
the
helicopter
with
Sato's
titanium
briefcase
at
his
feet.
The
OS
director's
secure
laptop
provided
her
with
worldwide
access
to
CIA
computer
systems
via
encrypted
satellite
uplinks.
Earlier
tonight,
she
had
used
this
computer
to
share
with
Bellamy
some
kind
of
information
that
had
stunned
the
man
into
cooperating
fully.
Simkins
had
no
idea
what
Bellamy
had
seen,
but
whatever
it
was,
the
Architect
had
been
visibly
shell-shocked
ever
since.
As
Sato
entered
the
foyer,
she
paused
a
moment,
bowing
her
head
over
Hartmann's
body.
A
moment
later,
she
raised
her
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
Simkins.
"No
sign
of
Langdon
or
Katherine?
Or
Peter
Solomon?"
Simkins
shook
his
head.
"If
they're
still
alive,
he
took
them
with
him."
"Did
you
see
a
computer
in
the
house?"
"Yes,
ma'am.
In
the
office."
"Show
me."
Simkins
led
Sato
out
of
the
foyer
and
into
the
living
room.
The
plush
carpet
was
covered
with
broken
glass
from
the
shattered
bay
window.
They
walked
past
a
fireplace,
a
large
painting,
and
several
bookshelves
to
an
office
door.
The
office
was
wood
paneled,
with
an
antique
desk
and
a
large
computer
monitor.
Sato
walked
around
behind
the
desk
and
eyed
the
screen,
immediately
scowling.
"Damn
it,"
she
said
under
her
breath.
Simkins
circled
around
and
looked
at
the
screen.
It
was
blank.
"What's
wrong?"
Sato
pointed
to
an
empty
docking
station
on
the
desk.
"He
uses
a
laptop.
He
took
it
with
him."
Simkins
didn't
follow.
"Does
he
have
information
you
want
to
see?"
"No,"
Sato
replied,
her
tone
grave.
"He
has
information
I
want
nobody
to
see."
Downstairs
in
the
hidden
basement,
Katherine
Solomon
had
heard
the
sounds
of
helicopter
blades
followed
by
breaking
glass
and
heavy
boots
on
the
floor
above
her.
She
tried
to
cry
out
for
help,
but
the
gag
in
her
mouth
made
it
impossible.
She
could
barely
make
a
sound.
The
harder
she
tried,
the
faster
the
blood
began
flowing
from
her
elbow.
She
was
feeling
short
of
breath
and
a
little
dizzy.
Katherine
knew
she
needed
to
calm
down.
Use
your
mind,
Katherine.
With
all
of
her
intention,
she
coaxed
herself
into
a
meditative
state.
Robert
Langdon'
s
mind
floated
through
the
emptiness
of
space.
He
peered
into
the
infinite
void,
searching
for
any
points
of
reference.
He
found
nothing.
Total
darkness.
Total
silence.
Total
peace.
There
was
not
even
the
pull
of
gravity
to
tell
him
which
way
was
up.
His
body
was
gone.
This
must
be
death.
Time
seemed
to
be
telescoping,
stretching
and
compressing,
as
if
it
had
no
bearings
in
this
place.
He
had
lost
all
track
of
how
much
time
had
passed.
Ten
seconds?
Ten
minutes?
Ten
days?
Suddenly,
however,
like
distant
fiery
explosions
in
far-off
galaxies,
memories
began
to
materialize,
billowing
toward
Langdon
like
shock
waves
across
a
vast
nothingness.
All
at
once,
Robert
Langdon
began
to
remember.
The
images
tore
through
him
vivid
and
disturbing.
He
was
staring
up
at
a
face
that
was
covered
with
tattoos.
A
pair
of
powerful
hands
lifted
his
head
and
smashed
it
into
the
floor.
Pain
erupted
and
then
darkness.
Gray
light.
Throbbing.
Wisps
of
memory.
Langdon
was
being
dragged,
half
conscious,
down,
down,
down.
His
captor
was
chanting
something.
Verbum
significatium
Verbum
omnificum
Verbum
perdo
Director
Sato
stood
alone
in
the
study,
waiting
while
the
CIA
satellite-
imaging
division
processed
her
request.
One
of
the
luxuries
of
working
in
the
D.C.
area
was
the
satellite
coverage.
With
luck,
one
of
them
might
have
been
properly
positioned
to
get
photos
of
this
home
tonight
possibly
capturing
a
vehicle
leaving
the
place
in
the
last
half
hour.
"Sorry,
ma'am,"
the
satellite
technician
said.
"No
coverage
of
those
coordinates
tonight.
Do
you
want
to
make
a
reposition
request?"
"No
thanks.
Too
late."
She
hung
up.
Sato
exhaled,
now
having
no
idea
how
they
would
figure
out
where
their
target
had
gone.
She
walked
out
to
the
foyer,
where
her
men
had
bagged
Agent
Hartmann's
body
and
were
carrying
it
toward
the
chopper.
Sato
had
ordered
Agent
Simkins
to
gather
his
men
and
prepare
for
the
return
to
Langley,
but
Simkins
was
in
the
living
room
on
his
hands
and
knees.
He
looked
like
he
was
ill.
"You
okay?"
He
glanced
up,
an
odd
look
on
his
face.
"Did
you
see
this?"
He
pointed
at
the
living-room
floor.
Sato
came
over
and
looked
down
at
the
plush
carpet.
She
shook
her
head,
seeing
nothing.
"Crouch
down,"
Simkins
said.
"Look
at
the
nap
of
the
carpet."
She
did.
After
a
moment,
she
saw
it.
The
fibers
of
the
carpet
looked
like
they
had
been
mashed
down
depressed
along
two
straight
lines
as
if
the
wheels
of
something
heavy
had
been
rolled
across
the
room.
"The
strange
thing,"
Simkins
said,
"is
where
the
tracks
go."
He
pointed.
Sato's
gaze
followed
the
faint
parallel
lines
across
the
living-room
carpet.
The
tracks
seemed
to
disappear
beneath
a
large
floor-to-ceiling
painting
that
hung
beside
the
fireplace.
What
in
the
world?
Simkins
walked
over
to
the
painting
and
tried
to
lift
it
down
from
the
wall.
It
didn't
budge.
"It's
fixed,"
he
said,
now
running
his
fingers
around
the
edges.
"Hold
on,
there's
something
underneath"
His
finger
hit
a
small
lever
beneath
the
bottom
edge,
and
something
clicked.
Sato
stepped
forward
as
Simkins
pushed
the
frame
and
the
entire
painting
rotated
slowly
on
its
center,
like
a
revolving
door.
He
raised
his
flashlight
and
shined
it
into
the
dark
space
beyond.
Sato's
eyes
narrowed.
Here
we
go.
At
the
end
of
a
short
corridor
stood
a
heavy
metal
door.
The
memories
that
had
billowed
through
the
blackness
of
Langdon's
mind
had
come
and
gone.
In
their
wake,
a
trail
of
red-hot
sparks
was
swirling,
along
with
the
same
eerie,
distant
whisper.
Verbum
significatium
Verbum
omnificum
Verbum
perdo.
The
chanting
continued
like
the
drone
of
voices
in
a
medieval
canticle.
Verbum
significatium
Verbum
omnificum.
The
words
now
tumbled
through
the
empty
void,
fresh
voices
echoing
all
around
him.
Apocalypsis
Franklin
Apocalypsis
Verbum
Apocalypsis
Without
warning,
a
mournful
bell
began
tolling
somewhere
in
the
distance.
The
bell
rang
on
and
on,
growing
louder.
It
tolled
more
urgently
now,
as
if
hoping
Langdon
would
understand,
as
if
urging
his
mind
to
follow.
The
tolling
bell
in
the
clock
tower
rang
for
three
full
minutes,
rattling
the
crystal
chandelier
that
hung
above
Langdon's
head.
Decades
ago,
he
had
attended
lectures
in
this
well-loved
assembly
hall
at
Phillips
Exeter
Academy.
Today,
however,
he
was
here
to
listen
to
a
dear
friend
address
the
student
body.
As
the
lights
dimmed,
Langdon
took
a
seat
against
the
back
wall,
beneath
a
pantheon
of
headmaster
portraits.
A
hush
fell
across
the
crowd.
In
total
darkness,
a
tall,
shadowy
figure
crossed
the
stage
and
took
the
podium.
"Good
morning,"
the
faceless
voice
whispered
into
the
microphone.
Everyone
sat
up,
straining
to
see
who
was
addressing
them.
A
slide
projector
flashed
to
life,
revealing
a
faded
sepia
photograph
a
dramatic
castle
with
a
red
sandstone
facade,
high
square
towers,
and
Gothic
embellishments.
The
shadow
spoke
again.
"Who
can
tell
me
where
this
is?"
"England!"
a
girl
declared
in
the
darkness.
"This
facade
is
a
blend
of
early
Gothic
and
late
Romanesque,
making
this
the
quintessential
Norman
castle
and
placing
it
in
England
at
about
the
twelfth
century."
"Wow,"
the
faceless
voice
replied.
"Someone
knows
her
architecture."
Quiet
groans
all
around.
"Unfortunately,"
the
shadow
added,
"you
missed
by
three
thousand
miles
and
half
a
millennium."
The
room
perked
up.
The
projector
now
flashed
a
full-color,
modern
photo
of
the
same
castle
from
a
different
angle.
The
castle's
Seneca
Creek
sandstone
towers
dominated
the
foreground,
but
in
the
background,
startlingly
close,
stood
the
majestic,
white,
columned
dome
of
the
U.S.
Capitol
Building.
"Hold
on!"
the
girl
exclaimed.
"There's
a
Norman
castle
in
D.C.?!"
"Since
1855,"
the
voice
replied.
"Which
is
when
this
next
photo
was
taken."
A
new
slide
appeared
a
black-and-white
interior
shot,
depicting
a
massive
vaulted
ballroom,
furnished
with
animal
skeletons,
scientific
display
cases,
glass
jars
with
biological
samples,
archaeological
artifacts,
and
plaster
casts
of
prehistoric
reptiles.
"This
wondrous
castle,"
the
voice
said,
"was
America's
first
real
science
museum.
It
was
a
gift
to
America
from
a
wealthy
British
scientist
who,
like
our
forefathers,
believed
our
fledgling
country
could
become
the
land
of
enlightenment.
He
bequeathed
to
our
forefathers
a
massive
fortune
and
asked
them
to
build
at
the
core
of
our
nation
'an
establishment
for
the
increase
and
diffusion
of
knowledge.'He
paused
a
long
moment.
"Who
can
tell
me
the
name
of
this
generous
scientist?"
A
timid
voice
in
front
ventured,
"James
SmithsonV
A
whisper
of
recognition
rippled
through
the
crowd.
"Smithson
indeed,"
the
man
on
stage
replied.
Peter
Solomon
now
stepped
into
the
light,
his
gray
eyes
flashing
playfully.
"Good
morning.
My
name
is
Peter
Solomon,
and
I
am
secretary
of
the
Smithsonian
Institution."
The
students
broke
into
wild
applause.
In
the
shadows,
Langdon
watched
with
admiration
as
Peter
captivated
the
young
minds
with
a
photographic
tour
of
the
Smithsonian
Institution's
early
history.
The
show
began
with
Smithsonian
Castle,
its
basement
science
labs,
corridors
lined
with
exhibits,
a
salon
full
of
mollusks,
scientists
who
called
themselves
"the
curators
of
crustaceans,"
and
even
an
old
photo
of
the
castle's
two
most
popular
residents
a
pair
of
now-
deceased
owls
named
Diffusion
and
Increase.
The
half
-hour
slide
show
ended
with
an
impressive
satellite
photo
of
the
National
Mall,
now
lined
with
enormous
Smithsonian
museums.
"As
I
said
when
I
began,"
Solomon
stated
in
conclusion,
"James
Smithson
and
our
forefathers
envisioned
our
great
country
to
be
a
land
of
enlightenment.
I
believe
today
they
would
be
proud.
Their
great
Smithsonian
Institution
stands
as
a
symbol
of
science
and
knowledge
at
the
very
core
of
America.
It
is
a
living,
breathing,
working
tribute
to
our
forefathers'
dream
for
America
a
country
founded
on
the
principles
of
knowledge,
wisdom,
and
science."
Solomon
clicked
off
the
slides
to
an
energetic
round
of
applause.
The
houselights
came
up,
along
with
dozens
of
eager
hands
with
questions.
Solomon
called
on
a
small
red-haired
boy
in
the
middle.
"Mr.
Solomon?"
the
boy
said,
sounding
puzzled.
"You
said
our
forefathers
fled
the
religious
oppression
of
Europe
to
establish
a
country
on
the
principles
of
scientific
advancement."
"That's
correct."
"But
I
was
under
the
impression
our
forefathers
were
devoutly
religious
men
who
founded
America
as
a
Christian
nation."
Solomon
smiled.
"My
friends,
don't
get
me
wrong,
our
forefathers
were
deeply
religious
men,
but
they
were
Deists
men
who
believed
in
God,
but
in
a
universal
and
open-minded
way.
The
only
religious
ideal
they
put
forth
was
religious
freedom."
He
pulled
the
microphone
from
the
podium
and
strode
out
to
the
edge
of
the
stage.
"America's
forefathers
had
a
vision
of
a
spiritually
enlightened
Utopia,
in
which
freedom
of
thought,
education
of
the
masses,
and
scientific
advancement
would
replace
the
darkness
of
outdated
religious
superstition."
A
blond
girl
in
back
raised
her
hand.
"Yes?"
"Sir,"
the
girl
said,
holding
up
her
cell
phone,
"I've
been
researching
you
online,
and
Wikipedia
says
you're
a
prominent
Freemason."
Solomon
held
up
his
Masonic
ring.
"I
could
have
saved
you
the
data
charges."
The
students
laughed.
"Yes,
well,"
the
girl
continued,
hesitating,
"you
just
mentioned
'outdated
religious
superstition,'
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
anyone
is
responsible
for
propagating
outdated
superstitions
it
would
be
the
Masons."
Solomon
seemed
unfazed.
"Oh?
How
so?"
"Well,
I've
read
a
lot
about
Masonry,
and
I
know
you've
got
a
lot
of
strange
ancient
rituals
and
beliefs.
This
article
online
even
says
that
Masons
believe
in
the
power
of
some
kind
of
ancient
magical
wisdom
which
can
elevate
man
to
the
realm
of
the
gods?"
Everyone
turned
and
stared
at
the
girl
as
if
she
were
nuts.
"Actually,"
Solomon
said,
"she's
right."
The
kids
all
spun
around
and
faced
front,
eyes
widening.
Solomon
suppressed
a
smile
and
asked
the
girl,
"Does
it
offer
any
other
Wiki-wisdom
about
this
magical
knowledge?"
The
girl
looked
uneasy
now,
but
she
began
to
read
from
the
Web
site.
'"To
ensure
this
powerful
wisdom
could
not
be
used
by
the
unworthy,
the
early
adepts
wrote
down
their
knowledge
in
code
cloaking
its
potent
truth
in
a
metaphorical
language
of
symbols,
myth,
and
allegory.
To
this
day,
this
encrypted
wisdom
is
all
around
us
encoded
in
our
mythology,
our
art,
and
the
occult
texts
of
the
ages.
Unfortunately,
modern
man
has
lost
the
ability
to
decipher
this
complex
network
of
symbolism
and
the
great
truth
has
been
lost.'"
Solomon
waited.
"That's
all?"
The
girl
shifted
in
her
seat.
"Actually,
there
is
a
little
bit
more."
"I
should
hope
so.
Please
tell
us."
The
girl
looked
hesitant,
but
she
cleared
her
throat
and
continued.
'"According
to
legend,
the
sages
who
encrypted
the
Ancient
Mysteries
long
ago
left
behind
a
key
of
sorts
a
password
that
could
be
used
to
unlock
the
encrypted
secrets.
This
magical
password
known
as
the
verbum
significatium
is
said
to
hold
the
power
to
lift
the
darkness
and
unlock
the
Ancient
Mysteries,
opening
them
to
all
human
understanding.'
Solomon
smiled
wistfully.
"Ah,
yes
the
verbum
significatium."
He
stared
into
space
for
a
moment
and
then
lowered
his
eyes
again
to
the
blond
girl.
"And
where
is
this
wonderful
word
now?"
The
girl
looked
apprehensive,
clearly
wishing
she
had
not
challenged
their
guest
speaker.
She
finished
reading.'Legend
holds
that
the
verbum
significatium
is
buried
deep
underground,
where
it
waits
patiently
for
a
pivotal
moment
in
history
a
moment
when
mankind
can
no
longer
survive
without
the
truth,
knowledge,
and
wisdom
of
the
ages.
At
this
dark
crossroads,
mankind
will
at
last
unearth
the
Word
and
herald
in
a
wondrous
new
age
of
enlightenment.'
The
girl
turned
off
her
phone
and
shrank
down
in
her
seat.
After
a
long
silence,
another
student
raised
his
hand.
"Mr.
Solomon,
you
don't
actually
believe
that,
right?"
Solomon
smiled.
"Why
not?
Our
mythologies
have
a
long
tradition
of
magic
words
that
provide
insight
and
godlike
powers.
To
this
day,
children
still
shout
'abracadabra'
in
hopes
of
creating
something
out
of
nothing.
Of
course,
we've
all
forgotten
that
this
word
is
not
a
toy;
it
has
roots
in
ancient
Aramaic
mysticism
Avrah
KaDabra
meaning
T
create
as
I
speak.'
Silence.
"But,
sir,"
the
student
now
pressed,
"surely
you
don't
believe
that
a
single
word
this
verbum
significatium
whatever
it
is
has
the
power
to
unlock
ancient
wisdom
and
bring
about
a
worldwide
enlightenment?"
Peter
Solomon's
face
revealed
nothing.
"My
own
beliefs
should
not
concern
you.
What
should
concern
you
is
that
this
prophecy
of
a
coming
enlightenment
is
echoed
in
virtually
every
faith
and
philosophical
tradition
on
earth.
Hindus
call
it
the
Krita
Age,
astrologers
call
it
the
Age
of
Aquarius,
the
Jews
describe
the
coming
of
the
Messiah,
theosophists
call
it
the
New
Age,
cosmologists
call
it
Harmonic
Convergence
and
predict
the
actual
date."
"December
21,
2012!"
someone
called.
"Yes,
unnervingly
soon
if
you're
a
believer
in
Mayan
math."
Langdon
chuckled,
recalling
how
Solomon,
ten
years
ago,
had
correctly
predicted
the
current
spate
of
television
specials
predicting
that
the
year
2012
would
mark
the
End
of
the
World.
"Timing
aside,"
Solomon
said,
"I
find
it
wondrous
to
note
that
throughout
history,
all
of
mankind's
disparate
philosophies
have
all
concurred
on
one
thing
that
a
great
enlightenment
is
coming.
In
every
culture,
in
every
era,
in
every
corner
of
the
world,
the
human
dream
has
focused
on
the
same
exact
concept
the
coming
apotheosis
of
man
the
impending
transformation
of
our
human
minds
into
their
true
potentiality."
He
smiled.
"What
could
possibly
explain
such
a
synchronicity
of
beliefs?"
"Truth,said
a
quiet
voice
in
the
crowd.
Solomon
wheeled.
"Who
said
that?"
The
hand
that
went
up
belonged
to
a
tiny
Asian
boy
whose
soft
features
suggested
he
might
be
Nepalese
or
Tibetan.
"Maybe
there
is
a
universal
truth
embedded
in
everyone's
soul.
Maybe
we
all
have
the
same
story
hiding
inside,
like
a
shared
constant
in
our
DNA.
Maybe
this
collective
truth
is
responsible
for
the
similarity
in
all
of
our
stories."
Solomon
was
beaming
as
he
pressed
his
hands
together
and
bowed
reverently
to
the
boy.
"Thank
you."
Everyone
was
quiet.
"Truth,"
Solomon
said,
addressing
the
room.
"Truth
has
power.
And
if
we
all
gravitate
toward
similar
ideas,
maybe
we
do
so
because
those
ideas
are
true
written
deep
within
us.
And
when
we
hear
the
truth,
even
if
we
don't
understand
it,
we
feel
that
truth
resonate
within
us
vibrating
with
our
unconscious
wisdom.
Perhaps
the
truth
is
not
learned
by
us,
but
rather,
the
truth
is
re-called
re-membered
re-cognized
as
that
which
is
already
inside
us."
The
silence
in
the
hall
was
complete.
Solomon
let
it
sit
for
a
long
moment,
then
quietly
said,
"In
closing,
I
should
warn
you
that
unveiling
the
truth
is
never
easy.
Throughout
history,
every
period
of
enlightenment
has
been
accompanied
by
darkness,
pushing
in
opposition.
Such
are
the
laws
of
nature
and
balance.
And
if
we
look
at
the
darkness
growing
in
the
world
today,
we
have
to
realize
that
this
means
there
is
equal
light
growing.
We
are
on
the
verge
of
a
truly
great
period
of
illumination,
and
all
of
us
all
of
you
are
profoundly
blessed
to
be
living
through
this
pivotal
moment
of
history.
Of
all
the
people
who
have
ever
lived,
in
all
the
eras
in
history
we
are
in
that
narrow
window
of
time
during
which
we
will
bear
witness
to
our
ultimate
renaissance.
After
millennia
of
darkness,
we
will
see
our
sciences,
our
minds,
and
even
our
religions
unveil
the
truth."
Solomon
was
about
to
get
a
hearty
round
of
applause
when
he
held
up
his
hand
for
silence.
"Miss?"
He
pointed
directly
to
the
contentious
blond
girl
in
back
with
the
cell
phone.
"I
know
you
and
I
didn't
agree
on
much,
but
I
want
to
thank
you.
Your
passion
is
an
important
catalyst
in
the
coming
changes.
Darkness
feeds
on
apathy
and
conviction
is
our
most
potent
antidote.
Keep
studying
your
faith.
Study
the
Bible."
He
smiled.
"Especially
the
final
pages."
"The
Apocalypse?"
she
said.
"Absolutely.
The
Book
of
Revelation
is
a
vibrant
example
of
our
shared
truth.
The
last
book
of
the
Bible
tells
the
identical
story
as
countless
other
traditions.
They
all
predict
the
coming
unveiling
of
great
wisdom."
Someone
else
said,
"But
isn't
the
Apocalypse
about
the
end
of
the
world?
You
know,
the
Antichrist,
Armageddon,
the
final
battle
between
good
and
evil?"
Solomon
chuckled.
"Who
here
studies
Greek?"
Several
hands
went
up.
"What
does
the
word
apocalypse
literally
mean?"
"It
means,"
one
student
began,
and
then
paused
as
if
surprised.
"Apocalypse
means
'to
unveil'
or
'to
reveal.'
Solomon
gave
the
boy
a
nod
of
approval.
"Exactly.
The
Apocalypse
is
literally
a
reveal-ation.
The
Book
of
Reveal-ation
in
the
Bible
predicts
an
unveiling
of
great
truth
and
unimaginable
wisdom.
The
Apocalypse
is
not
the
end
of
the
world,
but
rather
it
is
the
end
of
the
world
as
we
know
it.
The
prophecy
of
the
Apocalypse
is
just
one
of
the
Bible's
beautiful
messages
that
has
been
distorted."
Solomon
stepped
to
the
front
of
the
stage.
"Believe
me,
the
Apocalypse
is
coming
and
it
will
be
nothing
like
what
we
were
taught."
High
over
his
head,
the
bell
began
to
toll.
The
students
erupted
into
bewildered
and
thunderous
applause.
Katherine
Solomon
was
teetering
on
the
edge
of
consciousness
when
she
was
jolted
by
the
shock
wave
of
a
deafening
explosion.
Moments
later,
she
smelled
smoke.
Her
ears
were
ringing.
There
were
muffled
voices.
Distant.
Shouting.
Footsteps.
Suddenly
she
was
breathing
more
clearly.
The
cloth
had
been
pulled
from
her
mouth.
"You're
safe,"
a
man's
voice
whispered.
"Just
hold
on."
She
expected
the
man
to
pull
the
needle
out
of
her
arm
but
instead
he
was
yelling
orders.
"Bring
the
medical
kit
attach
an
IV
to
the
needle
infuse
lactated
Ringer's
solution
get
me
a
blood
pressure."
As
the
man
began
checking
her
vital
signs,
he
said,
"Ms.
Solomon,
the
person
who
did
this
to
you
where
did
he
go?"
Katherine
tried
to
speak,
but
she
could
not.
"Ms.
Solomon?"
the
voice
repeated.
"Where
did
he
go?"
Katherine
tried
to
pry
her
eyes
open,
but
she
felt
herself
fading.
"We
need
to
know
where
he
went,"
the
man
urged.
Katherine
whispered
three
words
in
response,
although
she
knew
they
made
no
sense.
"The
sacred
mountain."
Director
Sato
stepped
over
the
mangled
steel
door
and
descended
a
wooden
ramp
into
the
hidden
basement.
One
of
her
agents
met
her
at
the
bottom.
"Director,
I
think
you'll
want
to
see
this."
Sato
followed
the
agent
into
a
small
room
off
the
narrow
hallway.
The
room
was
brightly
lit
and
barren,
except
for
a
pile
of
clothing
on
the
floor.
She
recognized
Robert
Langdon's
tweed
coat
and
loafers.
Her
agent
pointed
toward
the
far
wall
at
a
large,
casketlike
container.
What
in
the
world?
Sato
moved
toward
the
container,
seeing
now
that
it
was
fed
by
a
clear
plastic
pipe
that
ran
through
the
wall.
Warily,
she
approached
the
tank.
Now
she
could
see
that
it
had
a
small
slider
on
top.
She
reached
down
and
slid
the
covering
to
one
side,
revealing
a
small
portal-like
window.
Sato
recoiled.
Beneath
the
Plexiglas
floated
the
submerged,
vacant
face
of
Professor
Robert
Langdon.
Light!
The
endless
void
in
which
Langdon
hovered
was
suddenly
filled
by
a
blinding
sun.
Rays
of
white-hot
light
streamed
across
the
blackness
of
space,
burning
into
his
mind.
The
light
was
everywhere.
Suddenly,
within
the
radiant
cloud
before
him,
a
beautiful
silhouette
appeared.
It
was
a
face
blurry
and
indistinct
two
eyes
staring
at
him
across
the
void.
Streams
of
light
surrounded
the
face,
and
Langdon
wondered
if
he
was
looking
into
the
face
of
God.
Sato
stared
down
into
the
tank,
wondering
if
Professor
Langdon
had
any
idea
what
had
happened.
She
doubted
it.
After
all,
disorientation
was
the
entire
purpose
of
this
technology.
Sensory-deprivation
tanks
had
been
around
since
the
fifties
and
were
still
a
popular
getaway
for
wealthy
New
Age
experimenters.
"Floating,"
as
it
was
called,
offered
a
transcendental
back-to-the-womb
experience
a
kind
of
meditative
aid
that
quieted
brain
activity
by
removing
all
sensory
input
light,
sound,
touch,
and
even
the
pull
of
gravity.
In
traditional
tanks,
the
person
would
float
on
his
back
in
a
hyperbuoyant
saline
solution
that
kept
his
face
above
the
water
so
he
could
breathe.
In
recent
years,
however,
these
tanks
had
taken
a
quantum
leap.
Oxygenated
perfluorocarbons.
This
new
technology
known
as
Total
Liquid
Ventilation
(TLV)
was
so
counterintuitive
that
few
believed
it
existed.
Breathable
liquid.
Liquid
breathing
had
been
a
reality
since
1966,
when
Leland
C.
Clark
successfully
kept
alive
a
mouse
that
had
been
submerged
for
several
hours
in
an
oxygenated
perfluorocarbon.
In
1989,
TLV
technology
made
a
dramatic
appearance
in
the
movie
The
Abyss,
although
few
viewers
realized
that
they
were
watching
real
science.
Total
Liquid
Ventilation
had
been
born
of
modern
medicine's
attempts
to
help
premature
babies
breathe
by
returning
them
to
the
liquid-filled
state
of
the
womb.
Human
lungs,
having
spent
nine
months
in
utero,
were
no
strangers
to
a
liquid-filled
state.
Perfluorocarbons
had
once
been
too
viscous
to
be
fully
breathable,
but
modern
breakthroughs
had
made
breathable
liquids
almost
the
consistency
of
water.
The
CIA's
Directorate
of
Science
and
Technology
"the
Wizards
of
Langley,"
as
they
were
known
within
the
intelligence
community
had
worked
extensively
with
oxygenated
perfluorocarbons
to
develop
technologies
for
the
U.S.
military.
The
navy's
elite
deep-ocean
diving
teams
found
that
breathing
oxygenated
liquid,
rather
than
the
usual
heliox
or
trimix,
gave
them
the
ability
to
dive
to
much
greater
depths
without
risk
of
pressure
sickness.
Similarly,
NASA
and
the
air
force
had
learned
that
pilots
equipped
with
a
liquid
breathing
apparatus
rather
than
a
traditional
oxygen
tank
could
withstand
far
higher
g-forces
than
usual
because
liquid
spread
the
g-force
more
evenly
throughout
the
internal
organs
than
gas
did.
Sato
had
heard
that
there
were
now
"extreme
experience
labs"
where
one
could
try
these
Total
Liquid
Ventilation
tanks
"Meditation
Machines,"
as
they
were
called.
This
particular
tank
had
probably
been
installed
for
its
owner's
private
experimentation,
although
the
addition
of
heavy,
lockable
latches
left
little
doubt
in
Sato's
mind
that
this
tank
had
also
been
used
for
darker
applications
an
interrogation
technique
with
which
the
CIA
was
familiar.
The
infamous
interrogation
technique
of
water
boarding
was
highly
effective
because
the
victim
truly
believed
he
was
drowning.
Sato
knew
of
several
classified
operations
in
which
sensory-deprivation
tanks
like
these
had
been
used
to
enhance
that
illusion
to
terrifying
new
levels.
A
victim
submerged
in
breathable
liquid
could
literally
be
"drowned."
The
panic
associated
with
the
drowning
experience
usually
made
the
victim
unaware
that
the
liquid
he
was
breathing
was
slightly
more
viscous
than
water.
When
the
liquid
poured
into
his
lungs,
he
would
often
black
out
from
fear,
and
then
awaken
in
the
ultimate
"solitary
confinement."
Topical
numbing
agents,
paralysis
drugs,
and
hallucinogens
were
mixed
with
the
warm
oxygenated
liquid
to
give
the
prisoner
the
sense
he
was
entirely
separated
from
his
body.
When
his
mind
sent
commands
to
move
his
limbs,
nothing
happened.
The
state
of
being
"dead"
was
terrifying
on
its
own,
but
the
true
disorientation
came
from
the
"rebirthing"
process,
which,
with
the
aid
of
bright
lights,
cold
air,
and
deafening
noise,
could
be
extremely
traumatic
and
painful.
After
a
handful
of
rebirths
and
subsequent
drownings,
the
prisoner
became
so
disorientated
that
he
had
no
idea
if
he
was
alive
or
dead
and
he
would
tell
the
interrogator
absolutely
anything.
Sato
wondered
if
she
should
wait
for
a
medical
team
to
extract
Langdon,
but
she
knew
she
didn't
have
time.
/
need
to
know
what
he
knows.
"Turn
out
the
lights,"
she
said.
"And
find
me
some
blankets."
The
blinding
sun
had
vanished.
The
face
had
also
disappeared.
The
blackness
had
returned,
but
Langdon
could
now
hear
distant
whispers
echoing
across
the
light-years
of
emptiness.
Muffled
voices
unintelligible
words.
There
were
vibrations
now
as
if
the
world
were
about
to
shake
apart.
Then
it
happened.
Without
warning,
the
universe
was
ripped
in
two.
An
enormous
chasm
opened
in
the
void
as
if
space
itself
had
ruptured
at
the
seams.
A
grayish
mist
poured
through
the
opening,
and
Langdon
saw
a
terrifying
sight.
Disembodied
hands
were
suddenly
reaching
for
him,
grabbing
his
body,
trying
to
yank
him
out
of
his
world.
No!
He
tried
to
fight
them
off,
but
he
had
no
arms
no
fists.
Or
did
he?
Suddenly
he
felt
his
body
materializing
around
his
mind.
His
flesh
had
returned
and
it
was
being
seized
by
powerful
hands
that
were
dragging
him
upward.
No!
Please!
But
it
was
too
late.
Pain
racked
his
chest
as
the
hands
heaved
him
through
the
opening.
His
lungs
felt
like
they
were
filled
with
sand.
/
can't
breathe!
He
was
suddenly
on
his
back
on
the
coldest,
hardest
surface
he
could
imagine.
Something
was
pressing
on
his
chest,
over
and
over,
hard
and
painful.
He
was
spewing
out
the
warmth.
/
want
to
go
back.
He
felt
like
he
was
a
child
being
born
from
a
womb.
He
was
convulsing,
coughing
up
liquid.
He
felt
pain
in
his
chest
and
neck.
Excruciating
pain.
His
throat
was
on
fire.
People
were
talking,
trying
to
whisper,
but
it
was
deafening.
His
vision
was
blurred,
and
all
he
could
see
was
muted
shapes.
His
skin
felt
numb,
like
dead
leather.
His
chest
felt
heavier
now
pressure.
/
can't
breathe!
He
was
coughing
up
more
liquid.
An
overwhelming
gag
reflex
seized
him,
and
he
gasped
inward.
Cold
air
poured
into
his
lungs,
and
he
felt
like
a
newborn
taking
his
first
breath
on
earth.
This
world
was
excruciating.
All
Langdon
wanted
was
to
return
to
the
womb.
Robert
Langdon
had
no
idea
how
much
time
had
passed.
He
could
feel
now
that
he
was
lying
on
his
side,
wrapped
in
towels
and
blankets
on
a
hard
floor.
A
familiar
face
was
gazing
down
at
him
but
the
streams
of
glorious
light
were
gone.
The
echoes
of
distant
chanting
still
hung
in
his
mind.
Verbum
significatium
Verbum
omnificum
"Professor
Langdon,"
someone
whispered.
"Do
you
know
where
you
are?"
Langdon
nodded
weakly,
still
coughing.
More
important,
he
had
begun
to
realize
what
was
going
on
tonight.
Wrapped
in
wool
blankets,
Langdon
stood
on
wobbly
legs
and
stared
down
at
the
open
tank
of
liquid.
His
body
had
returned
to
him,
although
he
wished
it
had
not.
His
throat
and
lungs
burned.
This
world
felt
hard
and
cruel.
Sato
had
just
explained
the
sensory-deprivation
tank
adding
that
if
she
had
not
pulled
him
out,
he
would
have
died
of
starvation,
or
worse.
Langdon
had
little
doubt
that
Peter
had
endured
a
similar
experience.
Peter
is
in
the
in-between,
the
tattooed
man
had
told
him
earlier
tonight.
He
is
in
purgatory
Hamistagan.
If
Peter
had
endured
more
than
one
of
those
birthing
processes,
Langdon
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
Peter
had
told
his
captor
anything
he
had
wanted
to
know.
Sato
motioned
for
Langdon
to
follow
her,
and
he
did,
trudging
slowly
down
a
narrow
hall,
deeper
into
this
bizarre
lair
that
he
was
now
seeing
for
the
first
time.
They
entered
a
square
room
with
a
stone
table
and
eerie-
colored
lighting.
Katherine
was
here,
and
Langdon
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief.
Even
so,
the
scene
was
worrisome.
Katherine
was
lying
on
her
back
on
a
stone
table.
Blood-soaked
towels
lay
on
the
floor.
A
CIA
agent
was
holding
an
IV
bag
above
her,
the
tube
connected
to
her
arm.
She
was
sobbing
quietly.
"Katherine?"
Langdon
croaked,
barely
able
to
speak.
She
turned
her
head,
looking
disorientated
and
confused.
"Robert?!"
Her
eyes
widened
with
disbelief
and
then
joy.
"But
I
saw
you
drown!"
He
moved
toward
the
stone
table.
Katherine
pulled
herself
to
a
seated
position,
ignoring
her
IV
tube
and
the
medical
objections
of
the
agent.
Langdon
reached
the
table,
and
Katherine
reached
out,
wrapping
her
arms
around
his
blanket-clad
body,
holding
him
close.
"Thank
God,"
she
whispered,
kissing
his
cheek.
Then
she
kissed
him
again,
squeezing
him
as
though
she
didn't
believe
he
was
real.
"I
don't
understand
how"
Sato
began
saying
something
about
sensory-deprivation
tanks
and
oxygenated
perfluorocarbons,
but
Katherine
clearly
wasn't
listening.
She
just
held
Langdon
close.
"Robert,"
she
said,
"Peter's
alive."
Her
voice
wavered
as
she
recounted
her
horrifying
reunion
with
Peter.
She
described
his
physical
condition
the
wheelchair,
the
strange
knife,
the
allusions
to
some
kind
of
"sacrifice,"
and
how
she
had
been
left
bleeding
as
a
human
hourglass
to
persuade
Peter
to
cooperate
quickly.
Langdon
could
barely
speak.
"Do
you
have
any
idea
where
they
went?!"
"He
said
he
was
taking
Peter
to
the
sacred
mountain."
Langdon
pulled
away
and
stared
at
her.
Katherine
had
tears
in
her
eyes.
"He
said
he
had
deciphered
the
grid
on
the
bottom
of
the
pyramid,
and
that
the
pyramid
told
him
to
go
to
the
sacred
mountain."
"Professor,"
Sato
pressed,
"does
that
mean
anything
to
you?"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"Not
at
all."
Still,
he
felt
a
surge
of
hope.
"But
if
he
got
the
information
off
the
bottom
of
the
pyramid,
we
can
get
it,
too."
/
told
him
how
to
solve
it.
Sato
shook
her
head.
"The
pyramid's
gone.
We've
looked.
He
took
it
with
him."
Langdon
remained
silent
a
moment,
closing
his
eyes
and
trying
to
recall
what
he
had
seen
on
the
base
of
the
pyramid.
The
grid
of
symbols
had
been
one
of
the
last
images
he
had
seen
before
drowning,
and
trauma
had
a
way
of
burning
memories
deeper
into
the
mind.
He
could
recall
some
of
the
grid,
definitely
not
all
of
it,
but
maybe
enough?
He
turned
to
Sato
and
said
hurriedly,
"I
may
be
able
to
remember
enough,
but
I
need
you
to
look
up
something
on
the
Internet."
She
pulled
out
her
BlackBerry.
"Run
a
search
for
'The
Order
Eight
Franklin
Square.'
Sato
gave
him
a
startled
look
but
began
typing
without
questions.
Langdon'
s
vision
was
still
blurry,
and
he
was
only
now
starting
to
process
his
strange
surroundings.
He
realized
that
the
stone
table
on
which
they
were
leaning
was
covered
with
old
bloodstains,
and
the
wall
to
his
right
was
entirely
plastered
with
pages
of
text,
photos,
drawings,
maps,
and
a
giant
web
of
strings
interconnecting
them.
My
God.
Langdon
moved
toward
the
strange
collage,
still
clutching
the
blankets
around
his
body.
Tacked
on
the
wall
was
an
utterly
bizarre
collection
of
information
pages
from
ancient
texts
ranging
from
black
magic
to
Christian
Scripture,
drawings
of
symbols
and
sigils,
pages
of
conspiracy-theory
Web
sites,
and
satellite
photos
of
Washington,
D.C.,
scrawled
with
notes
and
question
marks.
One
of
the
sheets
was
a
long
list
of
words
in
many
languages.
He
recognized
some
of
them
as
sacred
Masonic
words,
others
as
ancient
magic
words,
and
others
from
ceremonial
incantations.
Is
that
what
he's
looking
for?
A
word?
Is
it
that
simple?
Langdon'
s
long-standing
skepticism
about
the
Masonic
Pyramid
was
based
largely
on
what
it
allegedly
revealed
the
location
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries.
This
discovery
would
have
to
involve
an
enormous
vault
filled
with
thousands
upon
thousands
of
volumes
that
had
somehow
survived
the
long-lost
ancient
libraries
in
which
they
had
once
been
stored.
It
all
seemed
impossible.
A
vault
that
big?
Beneath
D.C.
?
Now,
however,
his
recollection
of
Peter's
lecture
at
Phillips
Exeter,
combined
with
these
lists
of
magic
words,
had
opened
another
startling
possibility.
Langdon
most
definitely
did
not
believe
in
the
power
of
magic
words
and
yet
it
seemed
pretty
clear
that
the
tattooed
man
did.
His
pulse
quickened
as
he
again
scanned
the
scrawled
notes,
the
maps,
the
texts,
the
printouts,
and
all
the
interconnected
strings
and
sticky
notes.
Sure
enough,
there
was
one
recurring
theme.
My
God,
he's
looking
for
the
verbum
significatium
the
Lost
Word.
Langdon
let
the
thought
take
shape,
recalling
fragments
of
Peter's
lecture.
The
Lost
Word
is
what
he's
looking
for!
That's
what
he
believes
is
buried
here
in
Washington.
Sato
arrived
beside
him.
"Is
this
what
you
asked
for?"
She
handed
him
her
BlackBerry.
Langdon
looked
at
the
eight-by-eight
grid
of
numbers
on
the
screen.
"Exactly."
He
grabbed
a
piece
of
scrap
paper.
"I'll
need
a
pen."
Sato
handed
him
one
from
her
pocket.
"Please
hurry."
Inside
the
basement
office
of
the
Directorate
of
Science
and
Technology,
Nola
Kaye
was
once
again
studying
the
redacted
document
brought
to
her
by
sys-sec
Rick
Parrish.
What
the
hell
is
the
CIA
director
doing
with
a
file
about
ancient
pyramids
and
secret
underground
locations?
She
grabbed
the
phone
and
dialed.
Sato
answered
instantly,
sounding
tense.
"Nola,
I
was
just
about
to
call
you."
"I
have
new
information,"
Nola
said.
"I'm
not
sure
how
this
fits,
but
I've
discovered
there's
a
redacted
"Forget
it,
whatever
it
is,"
Sato
interrupted.
"We're
out
of
time.
We
failed
to
apprehend
the
target,
and
I
have
every
reason
to
believe
he's
about
to
carry
out
his
threat."
Nola
felt
a
chill.
"The
good
news
is
we
know
exactly
where
he's
going."
Sato
took
a
deep
breath.
"The
bad
news
is
that
he's
carrying
a
laptop
with
him."
Less
than
ten
miles
away,
Mal'akh
tucked
the
blanket
around
Peter
Solomon
and
wheeled
him
across
a
moonlit
parking
lot
into
the
shadow
of
an
enormous
building.
The
structure
had
exactly
thirty-three
outer
columns
each
precisely
thirty-three
feet
tall.
The
mountainous
structure
was
deserted
at
this
hour,
and
nobody
would
ever
see
them
back
here.
Not
that
it
mattered.
From
a
distance,
no
one
would
think
twice
about
a
tall,
kindly-looking
man
in
a
long
black
coat
taking
a
bald
invalid
for
an
evening
stroll.
When
they
reached
the
rear
entrance,
Marakh
wheeled
Peter
up
close
to
the
security
keypad.
Peter
stared
at
it
defiantly,
clearly
having
no
intention
of
entering
the
code.
Mal'akh
laughed.
"You
think
you're
here
to
let
me
in?
Have
you
forgotten
so
soon
that
I
am
one
of
your
brethren?"
He
reached
out
and
typed
the
access
code
that
he
had
been
given
after
his
initiation
to
the
thirty-
third
degree.
The
heavy
door
clicked
open.
Peter
groaned
and
began
struggling
in
the
wheelchair.
"Peter,
Peter,"
Mal'akh
cooed.
"Picture
Katherine.
Be
cooperative,
and
she
will
live.
You
can
save
her.
I
give
you
my
word."
Mal'akh
wheeled
his
captive
inside
and
relocked
the
door
behind
them,
his
heart
racing
now
with
anticipation.
He
pushed
Peter
through
some
hallways
to
an
elevator
and
pressed
the
call
button.
The
doors
opened,
and
Mal'akh
backed
in,
pulling
the
wheelchair
along
with
him.
Then,
making
sure
Peter
could
see
what
he
was
doing,
he
reached
out
and
pressed
the
uppermost
button.
A
look
of
deepening
dread
crossed
Peter's
tortured
face.
"Shh"
Mal'akh
whispered,
gently
stroking
Peter's
shaved
head
as
the
elevator
doors
closed.
"As
you
well
know
the
secret
is
how
to
die."
/
can
't
remember
all
the
symbols!
Langdon
closed
his
eyes,
doing
his
best
to
recall
the
precise
locations
of
the
symbols
on
the
bottom
of
the
stone
pyramid,
but
even
his
eidetic
memory
did
not
have
that
degree
of
recall.
He
wrote
down
the
few
symbols
he
could
remember,
placing
each
one
in
the
location
indicated
by
Franklin's
magic
square.
So
far,
however,
he
saw
nothing
that
made
any
sense.

"Look!"
Katherine
urged.
"You
must
be
on
the
right
track.
The
first
row
is
all
Greek
letters
the
same
kinds
of
symbols
are
being
arranged
together!"
Langdon
had
noticed
this,
too,
but
he
could
not
think
of
any
Greek
word
that
fit
that
configuration
of
letters
and
spaces.
/

He
glanced
again
at
the
magic
square,
trying
to
recall
the
letter
that
had
been
in
the
number
one
spot
near
the
lower
left
corner.
Think!
He
closed
his
eyes,
trying
to
picture
the
base
of
the
pyramid.
The
bottom
row
next
to
the
left-hand
corner
what
letter
was
there?
For
an
instant,
Langdon
was
back
in
the
tank,
racked
with
terror,
staring
up
through
the
Plexiglas
at
the
bottom
of
the
pyramid.
Now,
suddenly,
he
saw
it.
He
opened
his
eyes,
breathing
heavily.
"The
first
letter
is
HV
Langdon
turned
back
to
the
grid
and
wrote
in
the
first
letter.
The
word
was
still
incomplete,
but
he
had
seen
enough.
Suddenly
he
realized
what
the
word
might
be.
u/
Pulse
pounding,
Langdon
typed
a
new
search
into
the
BlackBerry.
He
entered
the
English
equivalent
of
this
well-known
Greek
word.
The
first
hit
that
appeared
was
an
encyclopedia
entry.
He
read
it
and
knew
it
had
to
be
right.
HEREDOM
n.
a
significant
word
in
"high
degree"
Freemasonry,
from
French
Rose
Croix
rituals,
where
it
refers
to
a
mythical
mountain
in
Scotland,
the
legendary
site
of
the
first
such
Chapter.
From
the
Greek
u
originating
from
Hieros-domos,
Greek
for
Holy
House.
"That's
it!"
Langdon
exclaimed,
incredulous.
"That's
where
they
went!"
Sato
had
been
reading
over
his
shoulder
and
looked
lost.
"To
a
mythical
mountain
in
Scotland?!"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"No,
to
a
building
in
Washington
whose
code
name
is
Heredom."
The
House
of
the
Temple
known
among
its
brethren
as
Heredom
had
always
been
the
crown
jewel
of
the
Masonic
Scottish
Rite
in
America.
With
its
steeply
sloped,
pyramidical
roof,
the
building
was
named
for
an
imaginary
Scottish
mountain.
Mal'akh
knew,
however,
there
was
nothing
imaginary
about
the
treasure
hidden
here.
This
is
the
place,
he
knew.
The
Masonic
Pyramid
has
shown
the
way.
As
the
old
elevator
slowly
made
its
way
to
the
third
floor,
Mal'akh
took
out
the
piece
of
paper
on
which
he
had
reorganized
the
grid
of
symbols
using
the
Franklin
Square.
All
the
Greek
letters
had
now
shifted
to
the
first
row
along
with
one
simple
symbol.
HlE
P
6
o
4-
The
message
could
not
have
been
more
clear.
Beneath
the
House
of
the
Temple.
Heredom
The
Lost
Word
is
here
somewhere.
Although
Mal'akh
did
not
know
precisely
how
to
locate
it,
he
was
confident
that
the
answer
lay
in
the
remaining
symbols
on
the
grid.
Conveniently,
when
it
came
to
unlocking
the
secrets
of
the
Masonic
Pyramid
and
of
this
building,
no
one
was
more
qualified
to
help
than
Peter
Solomon.
The
Worshipful
Master
himself.
Peter
continued
to
struggle
in
the
wheelchair,
making
muffled
sounds
through
his
gag.
"I
know
you're
worried
about
Katherine,"
Mal'akh
said.
"But
it's
almost
over."
For
Mal'akh,
the
end
felt
like
it
had
arrived
very
suddenly.
After
all
the
years
of
pain
and
planning,
waiting
and
searching
the
moment
had
now
arrived.
The
elevator
began
to
slow,
and
he
felt
a
rush
of
excitement.
The
carriage
jolted
to
a
stop.
The
bronze
doors
slid
open,
and
Mal'akh
gazed
out
at
the
glorious
chamber
before
them.
The
massive
square
room
was
adorned
with
symbols
and
bathed
in
moonlight,
which
shone
down
through
the
oculus
at
the
pinnacle
of
the
ceiling
high
above.
I
have
come
full
circle,
Mal'akh
thought.
The
Temple
Room
was
the
same
place
in
which
Peter
Solomon
and
his
brethren
had
so
foolishly
initiated
Mal'akh
as
one
of
their
own.
Now
the
Masons'
most
sublime
secret
something
that
most
of
the
brethren
did
not
even
believe
existed
was
about
to
be
unearthed.
"He
won't
find
anything,"
Langdon
said,
still
feeling
groggy
and
disorientated
as
he
followed
Sato
and
the
others
up
the
wooden
ramp
out
of
the
basement.
"There
is
no
actual
Word.
It's
all
a
metaphor
a
symbol
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries."
Katherine
followed,
with
two
agents
assisting
her
weakened
body
up
the
ramp.
As
the
group
moved
gingerly
through
the
wreckage
of
the
steel
door,
through
the
rotating
painting,
and
into
the
living
room,
Langdon
explained
to
Sato
that
the
Lost
Word
was
one
of
Freemasonry'
s
most
enduring
symbols
a
single
word,
written
in
an
arcane
language
that
man
could
no
longer
decipher.
The
Word,
like
the
Mysteries
themselves,
promised
to
unveil
its
hidden
power
only
to
those
enlightened
enough
to
decrypt
it.
"It
is
said,"
Langdon
concluded,
"that
if
you
can
possess
and
understand
the
Lost
Word
then
the
Ancient
Mysteries
will
become
clear
to
you."
Sato
glanced
over.
"So
you
believe
this
man
is
looking
for
a
wordV
Langdon
had
to
admit
it
sounded
absurd
at
face
value,
and
yet
it
answered
a
lot
of
questions.
"Look,
I'm
no
specialist
in
ceremonial
magic,"
he
said,
"but
from
the
documents
on
his
basement
walls
and
from
Katherine'
s
description
of
the
untattooed
flesh
on
his
head
I'd
say
he's
hoping
to
find
the
Lost
Word
and
inscribe
it
on
his
body."
Sato
moved
the
group
toward
the
dining
room.
Outside,
the
helicopter
was
warming
up,
its
blades
thundering
louder
and
louder.
Langdon
kept
talking,
thinking
aloud.
"If
this
guy
truly
believes
he
is
about
to
unlock
the
power
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries,
no
symbol
would
be
more
potent
in
his
mind
than
the
Lost
Word.
If
he
could
find
it
and
inscribe
it
on
the
top
of
his
head
a
sacred
location
in
itself
then
he
would
no
doubt
consider
himself
perfectly
adorned
and
ritualistically
prepared
to"
He
paused,
seeing
Katherine
blanch
at
the
thought
of
Peter's
impending
fate.
"But,
Robert,"
she
said
weakly,
her
voice
barely
audible
over
the
helicopter
blades.
"This
is
good
news,
right?
If
he
wants
to
inscribe
the
Lost
Word
on
the
top
of
his
head
before
he
sacrifices
Peter,
then
we
have
time.
He
won't
kill
Peter
until
he
finds
the
Word.
And,
if
there
is
no
Word"
Langdon
tried
to
look
hopeful
as
the
agents
helped
Katherine
into
a
chair.
"Unfortunately,
Peter
still
thinks
you're
bleeding
to
death.
He
thinks
the
only
way
to
save
you
is
to
cooperate
with
this
lunaticprobably
to
help
him
find
the
Lost
Word."
"So
what?"
she
insisted.
"If
the
Word
doesn't
exist
"Katherine,"
Langdon
said,
staring
deeply
into
her
eyes.
"If
/believed
you
were
dying,
and
if
someone
promised
me
I
could
save
you
by
finding
the
Lost
Word,
then
I
would
find
this
man
a
word
any
word
and
then
I'd
pray
to
God
he
kept
his
promise."
"Director
Sato!"
an
agent
shouted
from
the
next
room.
"You'd
better
see
this!"
Sato
hurried
out
of
the
dining
room
and
saw
one
of
her
agents
coming
down
the
stairs
from
the
bedroom.
He
was
carrying
a
blond
wig.
What
the
hell?
"Man's
hairpiece,"
he
said,
handing
it
to
her.
"Found
it
in
the
dressing
room.
Have
a
close
look."
The
blond
wig
was
much
heavier
than
Sato
expected.
The
skullcap
seemed
to
be
molded
of
a
thick
gel.
Strangely,
the
underside
of
the
wig
had
a
wire
protruding
from
it.
"Gel-pack
battery
that
molds
to
your
scalp,"
the
agent
said.
"Powers
a
fiber-optic
pinpoint
camera
hidden
in
the
hair."
"What?"
Sato
felt
around
with
her
fingers
until
she
found
the
tiny
camera
lens
nestled
invisibly
within
the
blond
bangs.
"This
thing's
a
hidden
camera?"
"Video
camera,"
the
agent
said.
"Stores
footage
on
this
tiny
solid-state
card."
He
pointed
to
a
stamp-size
square
of
silicon
embedded
in
the
skullcap.
"Probably
motion
activated."
Jesus,
she
thought.
So
that's
how
he
did
it.
This
sleek
version
of
the
"flower
in
the
lapel"
secret
camera
had
played
a
key
role
in
the
crisis
the
OS
director
was
facing
tonight.
She
glared
at
it
a
moment
longer
and
then
handed
it
back
to
the
agent.
"Keep
searching
the
house,"
she
said.
"I
want
every
bit
of
information
you
can
find
on
this
guy.
We
know
his
laptop
is
missing,
and
I
want
to
know
exactly
how
he
plans
to
connect
it
to
the
outside
world
while
he's
on
the
move.
Search
his
study
for
manuals,
cables,
anything
at
all
that
might
give
us
a
clue
about
his
hardware."
"Yes,
ma'am."
The
agent
hurried
off.
Time
to
move
out.
Sato
could
hear
the
whine
of
the
helicopter
blades
at
full
pitch.
She
hurried
back
to
the
dining
room,
where
Simkins
had
now
ushered
Warren
Bellamy
in
from
the
helicopter
and
was
gathering
intel
from
him
about
the
building
to
which
they
believed
their
target
had
gone.
House
of
the
Temple.
"The
front
doors
are
sealed
from
within,"
Bellamy
was
saying,
still
wrapped
in
a
foil
blanket
and
shivering
visibly
from
his
time
outside
in
Franklin
Square.
"The
building's
rear
entrance
is
your
only
way
in.
It's
got
a
keypad
with
an
access
PIN
known
only
to
the
brothers."
"What's
the
PIN?"
Simkins
demanded,
taking
notes.
Bellamy
sat
down,
looking
too
feeble
to
stand.
Through
chattering
teeth,
he
recited
his
access
code
and
then
added,
"The
address
is
1733
Sixteenth,
but
you'll
want
the
access
drive
and
parking
area,
behind
the
building.
Kind
of
tricky
to
find,
but
"I
know
exactly
where
it
is,"
Langdon
said.
"I'll
show
you
when
we
get
there."
Simkins
shook
his
head.
"You're
not
coming,
Professor.
This
is
a
military
"The
hell
I'm
not!"
Langdon
fired
back.
"Peter's
in
there!
And
that
building's
a
labyrinth!
Without
someone
to
lead
you
in,
you'll
take
ten
minutes
to
find
your
way
up
to
the
Temple
Room!"
"He's
right,"
Bellamy
said.
"It's
a
maze.
There
is
an
elevator,
but
it's
old
and
loud
and
opens
in
full
view
of
the
Temple
Room.
If
you
hope
to
move
in
quietly,
you'll
need
to
ascend
on
foot."
"You'll
never
find
your
way,"
Langdon
warned.
"From
that
rear
entrance,
you're
navigating
through
the
Hall
of
Regalia,
the
Hall
of
Honor,
the
middle
landing,
the
Atrium,
the
Grand
Stair
"Enough,"
Sato
said.
"Langdon'
s
coming."
The
energy
was
growing.
Mal'akh
could
feel
it
pulsing
within
him,
moving
up
and
down
his
body
as
he
wheeled
Peter
Solomon
toward
the
altar.
/
will
exit
this
building
infinitely
more
powerful
than
when
I
entered.
All
that
remained
now
was
to
locate
the
final
ingredient.
"Verbum
significatium,he
whispered
to
himself.
"Verbum
omnificum.
Mal'akh
parked
Peter's
wheelchair
beside
the
altar
and
then
circled
around
and
unzipped
the
heavy
daybag
that
sat
on
Peter's
lap.
Reaching
inside,
he
lifted
out
the
stone
pyramid
and
held
it
up
in
the
moonlight,
directly
in
front
of
Peter's
eyes,
showing
him
the
grid
of
symbols
engraved
on
the
bottom.
"All
these
years,"
he
taunted,
"and
you
never
knew
how
the
pyramid
kept
her
secrets."
Mal'akh
set
the
pyramid
carefully
on
the
corner
of
the
altar
and
returned
to
the
bag.
"And
this
talisman,"
he
continued,
extracting
the
golden
capstone,
"did
indeed
bring
order
from
chaos,
exactly
as
promised."
He
placed
the
metal
capstone
carefully
atop
the
stone
pyramid,
and
then
stepped
back
to
give
Peter
a
clear
view.
"Behold,
your
symbolon
is
complete."
Peter'
s
face
contorted,
and
he
tried
in
vain
to
speak.
"Good.
I
can
see
you
have
something
you'd
like
to
tell
me."
Mal'akh
roughly
yanked
out
the
gag.
Peter
Solomon
coughed
and
gasped
for
several
seconds
before
he
finally
managed
to
speak.
"Katherine"
"Katherine's
time
is
short.
If
you
want
to
save
her,
I
suggest
you
do
exactly
as
I
say."
Mal'akh
suspected
she
was
probably
already
dead,
or
if
not,
very
close.
It
made
no
difference.
She
was
lucky
to
have
lived
long
enough
to
say
good-bye
to
her
brother.
"Please,"
Peter
begged,
his
voice
ragged.
"Send
an
ambulance
for
her"
"I
will
do
exactly
that.
But
first
you
must
tell
me
how
to
access
the
secret
staircase."
Peter's
expression
turned
to
one
of
disbelief.
"What?!"
"The
staircase.
Masonic
legend
speaks
of
stairs
that
descend
hundreds
of
feet
to
the
secret
location
where
the
Lost
Word
is
buried."
Peter
now
looked
panicked.
"You
know
the
legend,"
Mal'akh
baited.
"A
secret
staircase
hidden
beneath
a
stone."
He
pointed
to
the
central
altar
a
huge
block
of
granite
with
a
gilded
inscription
in
Hebrew:
GOD
SAID,
"LET
THERE
BE
LIGHT"
AND
THERE
WAS
LIGHT.
"Obviously,
this
is
the
right
place.
The
entrance
to
the
staircase
must
be
hidden
on
one
of
the
floors
beneath
us."
"There
is
no
secret
staircase
in
this
building!"
Peter
shouted.
Mal'akh
smiled
patiently
and
motioned
upward.
"This
building
is
shaped
like
a
pyramid."
He
pointed
to
the
four-sided
vaulted
ceiling
that
angled
up
to
the
square
oculus
in
the
center.
"Yes,
the
House
of
the
Temple
is
a
pyramid,
but
what
does
"Peter,
I
have
all
night."
Mal'akh
smoothed
his
white
silk
robe
over
his
perfect
body.
"Katherine,
however,
does
not.
If
you
want
her
to
live,
you
will
tell
me
how
to
access
the
staircase."
"I
already
told
you,"
he
declared,
"there
is
no
secret
staircase
in
this
building!"
"No?"
Mal'akh
calmly
produced
the
sheet
of
paper
on
which
he
had
reorganized
the
grid
of
symbols
from
the
base
of
the
pyramid.
"This
is
the
Masonic
Pyramid'
s
final
message.
Your
friend
Robert
Langdon
helped
me
decipher
it."
Mal'akh
raised
the
paper
and
held
it
in
front
of
Peter'
s
eyes.
The
Worshipful
Master
inhaled
sharply
when
he
saw
it.
Not
only
had
the
sixty-four
symbols
been
organized
into
clearly
meaningful
groups
but
an
actual
image
had
materialized
out
of
the
chaos.
An
image
of
a
staircase
beneath
a
pyramid.
Peter
Solomon
stared
in
disbelief
at
the
grid
of
symbols
before
him.
The
Masonic
Pyramid
had
kept
its
secret
for
generations.
Now,
suddenly,
it
was
being
unveiled,
and
he
felt
a
cold
sense
of
foreboding
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach.
The
pyramid's
final
code.
At
a
glance,
the
true
meaning
of
these
symbols
remained
a
mystery
to
Peter,
and
yet
he
could
immediately
understand
why
the
tattooed
man
believed
what
he
believed.
He
thinks
there
is
a
hidden
staircase
beneath
the
pyramid
called
Heredom.
He
misunderstands
these
symbols.

"Where
is
it?"
the
tattooed
man
demanded.
"Tell
me
how
to
find
the
staircase,
and
I
will
save
Katherine."
/
wish
I
could
do
that,
Peter
thought.
But
the
staircase
is
not
real.
The
myth
of
the
staircase
was
purely
symbolic
part
of
the
great
allegories
of
Masonry.
The
Winding
Staircase,
as
it
was
known,
appeared
on
the
second-degree
tracing
boards.
It
represented
man's
intellectual
climb
toward
the
Divine
Truth.
Like
Jacob's
ladder,
the
Winding
Staircase
was
a
symbol
of
the
pathway
to
heaven
the
journey
of
man
toward
God
the
connection
between
the
earthly
and
spiritual
realms.
Its
steps
represented
the
many
virtues
of
the
mind.
He
should
know
that,
Peter
thought.
He
endured
all
the
initiations.
Every
Masonic
initiate
learned
of
the
symbolic
staircase
that
he
could
ascend,
enabling
him
"to
participate
in
the
mysteries
of
human
science."
Freemasonry,
like
Noetic
Science
and
the
Ancient
Mysteries,
revered
the
untapped
potential
of
the
human
mind,
and
many
of
Masonry's
symbols
related
to
human
physiology.
The
mind
sits
like
a
golden
capstone
atop
the
physical
body.
The
Philosopher'
s
Stone.
Through
the
staircase
of
the
spine,
energy
ascends
and
descends,
circulating,
connecting
the
heavenly
mind
to
the
physical
body.
Peter
knew
it
was
no
coincidence
that
the
spine
was
made
up
of
exactly
thirty-three
vertebrae.
Thirty-three
are
the
degrees
of
Masonry.
The
base
of
the
spine,
or
sacrum,
literally
meant
"sacred
bone."
The
body
is
indeed
a
temple.
The
human
science
that
Masons
revered
was
the
ancient
understanding
of
how
to
use
that
temple
for
its
most
potent
and
noble
purpose.
Unfortunately,
explaining
the
truth
to
this
man
was
not
going
to
help
Katherine
at
all.
Peter
gazed
down
at
the
grid
of
symbols
and
gave
a
defeated
sigh.
"You're
right,"
he
lied.
"There
is
indeed
a
secret
staircase
beneath
this
building.
And
as
soon
as
you
send
help
to
Katherine,
I'll
take
you
to
it."
The
man
with
the
tattoos
simply
stared
at
him.
Solomon
glared
back,
eyes
defiant.
"Either
save
my
sister
and
learn
the
truth
or
kill
us
both
and
remain
ignorant
forever!"
The
man
quietly
lowered
the
paper
and
shook
his
head.
"I'm
not
happy
with
you,
Peter.
You
failed
your
test.
You
still
take
me
for
a
fool.
Do
you
truly
believe
I
don't
understand
what
it
is
I
seek?
Do
you
think
I
have
not
yet
grasped
my
true
potential?"
With
that,
the
man
turned
his
back
and
slipped
off
his
robe.
As
the
white
silk
fluttered
to
the
floor,
Peter
saw
for
the
first
time
the
long
tattoo
running
up
the
man's
spine.
Dear
God
Winding
up
from
the
man's
white
loincloth,
an
elegant
spiral
staircase
ascended
the
middle
of
his
muscular
back.
Each
stair
was
positioned
on
a
different
vertebra.
Speechless,
Peter
let
his
eyes
ascend
the
staircase,
all
the
way
up
to
the
base
of
the
man's
skull.
Peter
could
only
stare.
The
tattooed
man
now
tipped
his
shaved
head
backward,
revealing
the
circle
of
bare
flesh
on
the
pinnacle
of
his
skull.
The
virgin
skin
was
bordered
by
a
single
snake,
looped
in
a
circle,
consuming
itself.
At-one-ment.
Slowly
now,
the
man
lowered
his
head
and
turned
to
face
Peter.
The
massive
double-headed
phoenix
on
his
chest
stared
out
through
dead
eyes.
"I
am
looking
for
the
Lost
Word,"
the
man
said.
"Are
you
going
to
help
me
or
are
you
and
your
sister
going
to
die?"
You
know
how
to
find
it,
Mal'akh
thought.
You
know
something
you're
not
telling
me.
Peter
Solomon
had
revealed
things
under
interrogation
that
he
probably
didn't
even
recall
now.
The
repeated
sessions
in
and
out
of
the
deprivation
tank
had
left
him
delirious
and
compliant.
Incredibly,
when
he
spilled
his
guts,
everything
he
told
Mal'akh
had
been
consistent
with
the
legend
of
the
Lost
Word.
The
Lost
Word
is
not
a
metaphor
it
is
real.
The
Word
is
written
in
an
ancient
language
and
has
been
hidden
for
ages.
The
Word
is
capable
of
bringing
unfathomable
power
to
anyone
who
grasps
its
true
meaning.
The
Word
remains
hidden
to
this
day
and
the
Masonic
Pyramid
has
the
power
to
unveil
it.
"Peter,"
Mal'akh
now
said,
staring
into
his
captive's
eyes,
"when
you
looked
at
that
grid
of
symbols
you
saw
something.
You
had
a
revelation.
This
grid
means
something
to
you.
Tell
me."
"I
will
tell
you
nothing
until
you
send
help
to
Katherine!"
Mal'akh
smiled
at
him.
"Believe
me,
the
prospect
of
losing
your
sister
is
the
least
of
your
worries
right
now."
Without
another
word,
he
turned
to
Langdon's
daybag
and
started
removing
the
items
he
had
packed
in
his
basement.
Then
he
began
meticulously
arranging
them
on
the
sacrificial
altar.
A
folded
silk
cloth.
Pure
white.
A
silver
censer.
Egyptian
myrrh.
A
vial
of
Peter's
blood.
Mixed
with
ash.
A
black
crow's
feather.
His
sacred
stylus.
The
sacrificial
knife.
Forged
of
iron
from
a
meteorite
in
the
desert
of
Canaan.
"You
think
I
am
afraid
to
die?"
Peter
shouted,
his
voice
racked
with
anguish.
"If
Katherine
is
gone,
I
have
nothing
left!
You've
murdered
my
entire
family!
You've
taken
everything
from
me!"
"Not
everything"
Mal'akh
replied.
"Not
yet."
He
reached
into
the
day-bag
and
pulled
out
the
laptop
from
his
study.
He
turned
it
on
and
looked
over
at
his
captive.
"I'm
afraid
you
have
not
yet
grasped
the
true
nature
of
your
predicament."
Langdon
felt
his
stomach
drop
as
the
CIA
helicopter
leaped
off
the
lawn,
banked
hard,
and
accelerated
faster
than
he
ever
imagined
a
helicopter
could
move.
Katherine
had
stayed
behind
to
recuperate
with
Bellamy
while
one
of
the
CIA
agents
searched
the
mansion
and
waited
for
a
backup
team.
Before
Langdon
left,
she
had
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
and
whispered,
"Be
safe,
Robert."
Now
Langdon
was
holding
on
for
dear
life
as
the
military
helicopter
finally
leveled
out
and
raced
toward
the
House
of
the
Temple.
Seated
beside
him,
Sato
was
yelling
up
to
the
pilot.
"Head
for
Dupont
Circle!"
she
shouted
over
the
deafening
noise.
"We'll
set
down
there!"
Startled,
Langdon
turned
to
her.
"Dupont?!
That's
blocks
from
the
House
of
the
Temple!
We
can
land
in
the
Temple
parking
lot!"
Sato
shook
her
head.
"We
need
to
enter
the
building
quietly.
If
our
target
hears
us
coming
"We
don't
have
time!"
Langdon
argued.
"This
lunatic
is
about
to
murder
Peter!
Maybe
the
sound
of
the
helicopter
will
scare
him
and
make
him
stop!"
Sato
stared
at
him
with
ice-cold
eyes.
"As
I
have
told
you,
Peter
Solomon's
safety
is
not
my
primary
objective.
I
believe
I've
made
that
clear."
Langdon
was
in
no
mood
for
another
national-security
lecture.
"Look,
I'm
the
only
one
on
board
who
knows
his
way
through
that
building
"Careful,
Professor,"
the
director
warned.
"You
are
here
as
a
member
of
my
team,
and
I
will
have
your
complete
cooperation."
She
paused
a
moment
and
then
added,
"In
fact,
it
might
be
wise
if
I
now
apprised
you
fully
of
the
severity
of
our
crisis
tonight."
Sato
reached
under
her
seat
and
pulled
out
a
sleek
titanium
briefcase,
which
she
opened
to
reveal
an
unusually
complicated-looking
computer.
When
she
turned
it
on,
a
CIA
logo
materialized
along
with
a
log-in
prompt.
As
Sato
logged
in,
she
asked,
"Professor,
do
you
remember
the
blond
hairpiece
we
found
in
the
man's
home?"
"Yes."
"Well,
hidden
within
that
wig
was
a
tiny
fiber-optic
camera
concealed
in
the
bangs."
"A
hidden
camera?
I
don't
understand."
Sato
looked
grim.
"You
will."
She
launched
a
file
on
the
laptop.
ONE
MOMENT
PLEASE
DECRYPTING
FILE
A
video
window
popped
up,
filling
the
entire
screen.
Sato
lifted
the
briefcase
and
set
it
on
Langdon'
s
thighs,
giving
him
a
front-row
seat.
An
unusual
image
materialized
on
the
screen.
Langdon
recoiled
in
surprise.
What
the
hell?!
Murky
and
dark,
the
video
was
of
a
blindfolded
man.
He
was
dressed
in
the
garb
of
a
medieval
heretic
being
led
to
the
gallows
noose
around
his
neck,
left
pant
leg
rolled
up
to
the
knee,
right
sleeve
rolled
up
to
the
elbow,
and
his
shirt
gaping
open
to
reveal
his
bare
chest.
Langdon
stared
in
disbelief.
He
had
read
enough
about
Masonic
rituals
to
recognize
exactly
what
he
was
looking
at.
A
Masonic
initiate
preparing
to
enter
the
first
degree.
The
man
was
very
muscular
and
tall,
with
a
familiar
blond
hairpiece
and
deeply
tanned
skin.
Langdon
recognized
his
features
at
once.
The
man's
tattoos
had
obviously
been
concealed
beneath
bronzing
makeup.
He
was
standing
before
a
full-length
mirror
videotaping
his
reflection
through
the
camera
concealed
in
his
wig.
But
why?
The
screen
faded
to
black.
New
footage
appeared.
A
small,
dimly
lit,
rectangular
chamber.
A
dramatic
chessboard
floor
of
black-and-
white
tile.
A
low
wooden
altar,
flanked
on
three
sides
by
pillars,
atop
which
burned
flickering
candles.
Langdon
felt
a
sudden
apprehension.
Oh
my
God.
Filming
in
the
erratic
style
of
an
amateur
home
video,
the
camera
now
panned
up
to
the
periphery
of
the
room
to
reveal
a
small
group
of
men
observing
the
initiate.
The
men
were
dressed
in
ritual
Masonic
regalia.
In
the
darkness,
Langdon
could
not
make
out
their
faces,
but
he
had
no
doubt
where
this
ritual
was
taking
place.
The
traditional
layout
of
this
Lodge
Room
could
have
been
anywhere
in
the
world,
but
the
powder-blue
triangular
pediment
above
the
master's
chair
revealed
it
as
the
oldest
Masonic
lodge
in
D.C.
Potomac
Lodge
No.
5
home
of
George
Washington
and
the
Masonic
forefathers
who
laid
the
cornerstone
for
the
White
House
and
the
Capitol
Building.
The
lodge
was
still
active
today.
Peter
Solomon,
in
addition
to
overseeing
the
House
of
the
Temple,
was
the
master
of
his
local
lodge.
And
it
was
at
lodges
like
this
one
that
a
Masonic
initiate'
s
journey
always
began
where
he
underwent
the
first
three
degrees
of
Freemasonry.
"Brethren,"
Peter's
familiar
voice
declared,
"in
the
name
of
the
Great
Architect
of
the
Universe,
I
open
this
lodge
for
the
practice
of
Masonry
in
the
first
degree!"
A
gavel
rapped
loudly.
Langdon
watched
in
utter
disbelief
as
the
video
progressed
through
a
quick
series
of
dissolves
featuring
Peter
Solomon
performing
some
of
the
ritual's
starker
moments.
Pressing
a
shining
dagger
to
the
initiate
's
bare
chest
threatening
impalement
should
the
initiate
"inappropriately
reveal
the
Mysteries
of
Masonry"
describing
the
black-and-white
floor
as
representing
"the
living
and
the
dead"
outlining
punishments
that
included
"having
one's
throat
cut
across,
one's
tongue
torn
out
by
its
roots,
and
one's
body
buried
in
the
rough
sands
of
the
sea"
Langdon
stared.
Am
I
really
witnessing
this?
Masonic
initiation
rites
had
remained
shrouded
in
secrecy
for
centuries.
The
only
descriptions
that
had
ever
been
leaked
were
written
by
a
handful
of
estranged
brothers.
Langdon
had
read
those
accounts,
of
course,
and
yet
to
see
an
initiation
with
his
own
eyes
this
was
a
much
different
story.
Especially
edited
this
way.
Langdon
could
already
tell
that
the
video
was
an
unfair
piece
of
propaganda,
omitting
all
the
noblest
aspects
of
the
initiation
and
highlighting
only
the
most
disconcerting.
If
this
video
were
released,
Langdon
knew
it
would
become
an
Internet
sensation
over
night.
The
anti-Masonic
conspiracy
theorists
would
feed
on
this
like
sharks.
The
Masonic
organization,
and
especially
Peter
Solomon,
would
find
themselves
embroiled
in
a
firestorm
of
controversy
and
a
desperate
effort
at
damage
control
even
though
the
ritual
was
innocuous
and
purely
symbolic.
Eerily,
the
video
included
a
biblical
reference
to
human
sacrifice
"the
submission
of
Abraham
to
the
Supreme
Being
by
proffering
Isaac,
his
firstborn
son.Langdon
thought
of
Peter
and
willed
the
helicopter
to
fly
faster.
The
video
footage
shifted
now.
Same
room.
Different
night.
A
larger
group
of
Masons
looking
on.
Peter
Solomon
was
observing
from
the
master's
chair.
This
was
the
second
degree.
More
intense
now.
Kneeling
at
the
altar
vowing
to
"forever
conceal
the
enigmas
existing
within
Freemasonry"
consenting
to
the
penalty
of
"having
one's
chest
cavity
ripped
open
and
pulsing
heart
cast
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
as
offal
for
the
ravenous
beasts"
Langdon'
s
own
heart
was
pulsing
wildly
now
as
the
video
shifted
yet
again.
Another
night.
A
much
larger
crowd.
A
coffin-
shaped
"tracing
board"
on
the
floor.
The
third
degree.
This
was
the
death
ritual
the
most
rigorous
of
all
the
degrees
the
moment
in
which
the
initiate
was
forced
"to
face
the
final
challenge
of
personal
extinction."
This
grueling
interrogation
was
in
fact
the
source
of
the
common
phrase
to
give
someone
the
third
degree.
And
although
Langdon
was
very
familiar
with
academic
accounts
of
it,
he
was
in
no
way
prepared
for
what
he
now
saw.
The
murder.
In
violent,
rapid
intercuts,
the
video
displayed
a
chilling,
victim's
point-of-view
account
of
the
initiate's
brutal
murder.
There
were
simulated
blows
to
his
head,
including
one
with
a
Mason's
stone
maul.
All
the
while,
a
deacon
mournfully
told
the
story
of
"the
widow's
son"
Hiram
Abiff
the
master
Architect
of
King
Solomon's
temple,
who
chose
to
die
rather
than
reveal
the
secret
wisdom
he
possessed.
The
attack
was
mimed,
of
course,
and
yet
its
effect
on
camera
was
bloodcurdling.
After
the
deathblow,
the
initiate
now
"dead
to
his
former
self
was
lowered
into
his
symbolic
coffin,
where
his
eyes
were
shut
and
his
arms
were
crossed
like
those
of
a
corpse.
The
Masonic
brothers
rose
and
mournfully
circled
his
dead
body
while
a
pipe
organ
played
a
march
of
the
dead.
The
macabre
scene
was
deeply
disturbing.
And
it
only
got
worse.
As
the
men
gathered
around
their
slain
brother,
the
hidden
camera
clearly
displayed
their
faces.
Langdon
now
realized
that
Solomon
was
not
the
only
famous
man
in
the
room.
One
of
the
men
peering
down
at
the
initiate
in
his
coffin
was
on
television
almost
daily.
A
prominent
U.S.
senator.
Oh
God
The
scene
changed
yet
again.
Outside
now
nighttime
the
same
jumpy
video
footage
the
man
was
walking
down
a
city
street
strands
of
blond
hair
blowing
in
front
of
the
camera
turning
a
corner
.
.
.the
camera
angle
lowering
to
something
in
the
man's
hand
a
dollar
bill
a
close-up
focusing
on
the
Great
Seal
the
all-seeing
eye
the
unfinished
pyramid
and
then,
abruptly,
pulling
away
to
reveal
a
similar
shape
in
the
distance
a
massive
pyramidical
building
with
sloping
sides
rising
to
a
truncated
top.
The
House
of
the
Temple.
A
soul-deep
dread
swelled
within
him.
The
video
kept
moving
the
man
hurrying
toward
the
building
now
up
the
multitiered
staircase
toward
the
giant
bronze
doors
between
the
two
seventeen-ton
sphinx
guardians.
A
neophyte
entering
the
pyramid
of
initiation.
Darkness
now.
A
powerful
pipe
organ
played
in
the
distance
and
a
new
image
materialized.
The
Temple
Room.
Langdon
swallowed
hard.
On-screen,
the
cavernous
space
was
alive
with
electricity.
Beneath
the
oculus,
the
black
marble
altar
shone
in
the
moonlight.
Assembled
around
it,
seated
on
hand-tooled
pigskin
chairs,
awaited
a
somber
council
of
distinguished
thirty-third-degree
Masons,
present
to
bear
witness.
The
video
now
panned
across
their
faces
with
slow
and
deliberate
intention.
Langdon
stared
in
horror.
Although
he
had
not
seen
this
coming,
what
he
was
looking
at
made
perfect
sense.
A
gathering
of
the
most
decorated
and
accomplished
Masons
in
the
most
powerful
city
on
earth
would
logically
include
many
influential
and
well-known
individuals.
Sure
enough,
seated
around
the
altar,
adorned
in
their
long
silk
gloves,
Masonic
aprons,
and
glistening
jewels,
were
some
of
the
country's
most
powerful
men.
Two
Supreme
Court
justices
The
secretary
of
defense
The
speaker
of
the
House
Langdon
felt
ill
as
the
video
continued
panning
across
the
faces
of
those
in
attendance.
Three
prominent
senators
including
the
majority
leader
The
secretary
of
homeland
security
And
The
director
of
the
CIA
Langdon
wanted
only
to
look
away,
but
he
could
not.
The
scene
was
utterly
mesmerizing,
alarming
even
to
him.
In
an
instant,
he
had
come
to
understand
the
source
of
Sato's
anxiety
and
concern.
Now,
on-screen,
the
shot
dissolved
into
a
single
shocking
image.
A
human
skull
filled
with
dark
crimson
liquid.
The
famed
caput
mortuum
was
being
offered
forth
to
the
initiate
by
the
slender
hands
of
Peter
Solomon,
whose
gold
Masonic
ring
glinted
in
the
candlelight.
The
red
liquid
was
wine
and
yet
it
shimmered
like
blood.
The
visual
effect
was
frightful.
The
Fifth
Libation,
Langdon
realized,
having
read
firsthand
accounts
of
this
sacrament
in
John
Quincy
Adams's
Letters
on
the
Masonic
Institution.
Even
so,
to
see
it
happen
to
see
it
calmly
witnessed
by
America's
most
powerful
men
this
was
as
arresting
an
image
as
any
Langdon
had
ever
seen.
The
initiate
took
the
skull
in
his
hands
his
face
reflected
in
the
calm
surface
of
the
wine.
"May
this
wine
I
now
drink
become
a
deadly
poison
to
me,he
declared,
"should
I
ever
knowingly
or
willfully
violate
my
oath.
Obviously,
this
initiate
had
intended
to
violate
his
oath
beyond
all
imagination.
Langdon
could
barely
get
his
mind
around
what
would
happen
if
this
video
were
made
public.
No
one
would
understand.
The
government
would
be
thrown
into
upheaval.
The
airwaves
would
be
filled
with
the
voices
of
anti-Masonic
groups,
fundamentalists,
and
conspiracy
theorists
spewing
hatred
and
fear,
launching
a
Puritan
witch
hunt
all
over
again.
The
truth
will
be
twisted,
Langdon
knew.
As
it
always
is
with
the
Masons.
The
truth
was
that
the
brotherhood's
focus
on
death
was
in
fact
a
bold
celebration
of
life.
Masonic
ritual
was
designed
to
awaken
the
slumbering
man
inside,
lifting
him
from
his
dark
coffin
of
ignorance,
raising
him
into
the
light,
and
giving
him
eyes
to
see.
Only
through
the
death
experience
could
man
fully
understand
his
life
experience.
Only
through
the
realization
that
his
days
on
earth
were
finite
could
he
grasp
the
importance
of
living
those
days
with
honor,
integrity,
and
service
to
his
fellow
man.
Masonic
initiations
were
startling
because
they
were
meant
to
be
transformative.
Masonic
vows
were
unforgiving
because
they
were
meant
to
be
reminders
that
man's
honor
and
his
"word"
were
all
he
could
take
from
this
world.
Masonic
teachings
were
arcane
because
they
were
meant
to
be
universal
taught
through
a
common
language
of
symbols
and
metaphors
that
transcended
religions,
cultures,
and
races
creating
a
unified
"worldwide
consciousness"
of
brotherly
love.
For
a
brief
instant,
Langdon
felt
a
glimmer
of
hope.
He
tried
to
assure
himself
that
if
this
video
were
to
leak
out,
the
public
would
be
open-minded
and
tolerant,
realizing
that
all
spiritual
rituals
included
aspects
that
would
seem
frightening
if
taken
out
of
context
crucifixion
reenactments,
Jewish
circumcision
rites,
Mormon
baptisms
of
the
dead,
Catholic
exorcisms,
Islamic
niqab,
shamanic
trance
healing,
the
Jewish
Kaparot
ceremony,
even
the
eating
of
the
figurative
body
and
blood
of
Christ.
I'm
dreaming,
Langdon
knew.
This
video
will
create
chaos.
He
could
imagine
what
would
happen
if
the
prominent
leaders
of
Russia
or
the
Islamic
world
were
seen
in
a
video,
pressing
knives
to
bare
chests,
swearing
violent
oaths,
performing
mock
murders,
lying
in
symbolic
coffins,
and
drinking
wine
from
a
human
skull.
The
global
outcry
would
be
instantaneous
and
overwhelming.
God
help
us
On-screen
now,
the
initiate
was
raising
the
skull
to
his
lips.
He
tipped
it
backward
draining
the
blood-red
wine
sealing
his
oath.
Then
he
lowered
the
skull
and
gazed
out
at
the
assembly
around
him.
America's
most
powerful
and
trusted
men
gave
contented
nods
of
acceptance.
"Welcome,
brother,Peter
Solomon
said.
As
the
image
faded
to
black,
Langdon
realized
he
had
stopped
breathing.
Without
a
word,
Sato
reached
over,
closed
the
briefcase,
and
lifted
it
off
his
lap.
Langdon
turned
to
her
trying
to
speak,
but
he
could
find
no
words.
It
didn't
matter.
Understanding
was
written
all
over
his
face.
Sato
was
right.
Tonight
was
a
national-
security
crisis
of
unimaginable
proportions.
Dressed
in
his
loincloth,
Mal'akh
padded
back
and
forth
in
front
of
Peter
Solomon's
wheelchair.
"Peter,"
he
whispered,
enjoying
every
moment
of
his
captive's
horror,
"you
forgot
you
have
a
second
family
your
Masonic
brothers.
And
I
will
destroy
them,
too
unless
you
help
me."
Solomon
looked
almost
catatonic
in
the
glow
of
the
laptop
sitting
atop
his
thighs.
"Please,"
he
finally
stammered,
glancing
up.
"If
this
video
gets
out"
"If?"
Mal'akh
laughed.
"/fit
gets
out?"
He
motioned
to
the
small
cellular
modem
plugged
into
the
side
of
his
laptop.
"I'm
connected
to
the
world."
"You
wouldn't"
I
will,
Mal'akh
thought,
enjoying
Solomon's
horror.
"You
have
the
power
to
stop
me,"
he
said.
"And
to
save
your
sister.
But
you
have
to
tell
me
what
I
want
to
know.
The
Lost
Word
is
hidden
somewhere,
Peter,
and
I
know
this
grid
reveals
exactly
where
to
find
it."
Peter
glanced
at
the
grid
of
symbols
again,
his
eyes
revealing
nothing.
"Perhaps
this
will
help
to
inspire
you."
Mal'akh
reached
over
Peter's
shoulders
and
hit
a
few
keys
on
the
laptop.
An
e-mail
program
launched
on
the
screen,
and
Peter
stiffened
visibly.
The
screen
now
displayed
an
e-mail
that
Mal'akh
had
cued
earlier
tonight
a
video
file
addressed
to
a
long
list
of
major
media
networks.
Mal'akh
smiled.
"I
think
it's
time
we
share,
don't
you?"
"Don't!"
Mal'akh
reached
down
and
clicked
the
send
button
on
the
program.
Peter
jerked
against
his
bonds,
trying
unsuccessfully
to
knock
the
laptop
to
the
floor.
"Relax,
Peter,"
Mal'akh
whispered.
"It's
a
massive
file.
It
will
take
a
few
minutes
to
go
out."
He
pointed
to
the
progress
bar:

"If

me

Peter
was
ashen

the

inched
forward.

Mal'akh
now
lifted
the
computer
from
Peter's
lap
and
set
it
on
one
of
the
nearby
pigskin
chairs,
turning
the
screen
so
the
other
man
could
watch
the
progress.
Then
he
returned
to
Peter's
side
and
laid
the
page
of
symbols
in
his
lap.
"The
legends
say

Mal'akh
glanced

Mal'akh
returned
his
eyes
to
Peter.
Solomon
was
staring
at
him,
his
gray
eyes
blazing
now
with
hatred.
Hate
me,
Mal'akh
thought.
The
greater
the
emotion,
the
more
potent
the
energy
that
will
be
released
when
the
ritual
is
completed.
At
Langley,
Nola
Kaye
pressed
the
phone
to
her
ear,
barely
able
to
hear
Sato
over
the
noise
of
the
helicopter.
"They
said
it's
impossible
to
stop
the
file
transfer!"
Nola
shouted.
"To
shut
down
local
ISPs
would
take
at
least
an
hour,
and
if
he's
got
access
to
a

won't

Nowadays,
stopping
the
flow
of
digital

had
become
nearly
impossible.
There
were
too
many

leak
was
by
destroying
the
source
machine.
"I
pulled
the
spec
sheet
on
the
UH-60
you're
flying,"
Nola
said,
"and
it
looks
like
you're
equipped
with
EMP."
Electromagnetic-pulse
or
EMP
guns
were
now
commonplace
among
law
enforcement
agencies,
which
used
them
primarily
to
stop
car
chases
from
a
safe
distance.
By
firing
a
highly
concentrated
pulse
of
electromagnetic
radiation,
an
EMP
gun
could
effectively
fry
the
electronics
of
any
device
it
targeted
cars,
cell
phones,
computers.
According
to
Nola's
spec
sheet,
the
UH-60
had
a
chassis-mounted,
laser-
sighted,
six-
gigahertz
magnetron
with
a
fifty-dB-gain
horn
that
yielded
a
ten-gigawatt
pulse.
Discharged
directly
at
a
laptop,
the
pulse
would
fry
the
computer's
motherboard
and
instantly
erase
the
hard
drive.
"EMP
will
be
useless,"
Sato
yelled
back.
"Target
is
inside
a
stone
building.
No
sight
lines
and
thick
EM
shielding.
Do
you
have
any
indication
yet
if
the
video
has
gone
out?"
Nola
glanced
at
a
second
monitor,
which
was
running
a
continuous
search
for
breaking
news
stories
about
the
Masons.
"Not
yet,
ma'am.
But
if
it
goes
public,
we'll
know
within
seconds."
"Keep
me
posted."
Sato
signed
off.
Langdon
held
his
breath
as
the
helicopter
dropped
from
the
sky
toward
Dupont
Circle.
A
handful
of
pedestrians
scattered
as
the
aircraft
descended
through
an
opening
in
the
trees
and
landed
hard
on
the
lawn
just
south
of
the
famous
two-tiered
fountain
designed
by
the
same
two
men
who
created
the
Lincoln
Memorial.
Thirty
seconds
later,
Langdon
was
riding
shotgun
in
a
commandeered
Lexus
SUV,
tearing
up
New
Hampshire
Avenue
toward
the
House
of
the
Temple.
Peter
Solomon
was
desperately
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
do.
All
he
could
see
in
his
mind
were
the
images
of
Katherine
bleeding
in
the
basement
and
of
the
video
he
had
just
witnessed.
He
turned
his
head
slowly
toward
the
laptop
on
the
pigskin
chair
several
yards
away.
The
progress
bar
was
almost
a
third
of
the
way
filled.

The
tattooed
man
was
now
walking
slow
circles
around
the
square
altar,
swinging
a
lit
censer
and
chanting
to
himself.
Thick
puffs
of
white
smoke
swirled
up
toward
the
skylight.
The
man's
eyes
were
wide
now,
and
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
demonic
trance.
Peter
turned
his
gaze
to
the
ancient
knife
that
sat
waiting
on
the
white
silk
cloth
spread
across
the
altar.
Peter
Solomon
had
no
doubt
that
he
would
die
in
this
temple
tonight.
The
question
was
how
to
die.
Would
he
find
a
way
to
save
his
sister
and
his
brotherhood
or
would
his
death
be
entirely
in
vain?
He
glanced
down
at
the
grid
of
symbols.
When
he
had
first
laid
eyes
on
the
grid,
the
shock
of
the
moment
had
blinded
him
preventing
his
vision
from
piercing
the
veil
of
chaos
to
glimpse
the
startling
truth.
Now,
however,
the
real
significance
of
these
symbols
had
become
crystal
clear
to
him.
He
had
seen
the
grid
in
an
entirely
new
light.
Peter
Solomon
knew
exactly
what
he
needed
to
do.
Taking
a
deep
breath,
he
gazed
up
at
the
moon
through
the
oculus
above.
Then
he
began
to
speak.
All
great
truths
are
simple.
Mal'akh
had
learned
that
long
ago.
The
solution
that
Peter
Solomon
was
now
explaining
was
so
graceful
and
pure
that
Mal'akh
was
sure
that
it
could
only
be
true.
Incredibly,
the
solution
to
the
pyramid's
final
code
was
far
simpler
than
he
had
ever
imagined.
The
Lost
Word
was
right
before
my
eyes.
In
an
instant,
a
bright
ray
of
light
pierced
the
murkiness
of
the
history
and
myth
surrounding
the
Lost
Word.
As
promised,
the
Lost
Word
was
indeed
written
in
an
ancient
language
and
bore
mystical
power
in
every
philosophy,
religion,
and
science
ever
known
to
man.
Alchemy,
astrology,
Kabbalah,
Christianity,
Buddhism,
Rosicrucianism,
Freemasonry,
astronomy,
physics,
Noetics
Standing
now
in
this
initiation
chamber
atop
the
great
pyramid
of
Heredom,
Mal'akh
gazed
upon
the
treasure
he
had
sought
all
these
years,
and
he
knew
he
could
not
have
prepared
himself
more
perfectly.
Soon
I
am
complete.
The
Lost
Word
is
found.
In
Kalorama
Heights,
a
lone
CIA
agent
stood
amid
a
sea
of
garbage
that
he
had
dumped
out
of
the
trash
bins
that
had
been
found
in
the
garage.
"Ms.
Kaye?"
he
said,
speaking
to
Sato's
analyst
on
the
phone.
"Good
thinking
to
search
his
garbage.
I
think
I
just
found
something."
Inside
the
house,
Katherine
Solomon
was
feeling
stronger
with
every
passing
moment.
The
infusion
of
lactated
Ringer's
solution
had
successfully
raised
her
blood
pressure
and
quelled
her
throbbing
headache.
She
was
resting
now,
seated
in
the
dining
room,
with
explicit
instructions
to
remain
still.
Her
nerves
felt
frayed,
and
she
was
increasingly
anxious
for
news
about
her
brother.
Where
is
everybody?
The
CIA's
forensics
team
had
not
yet
arrived,
and
the
agent
who
had
stayed
behind
was
still
off
searching
the
premises.
Bellamy
had
been
sitting
with
her
in
the
dining
room,
still
wrapped
in
a
foil
blanket,
but
he,
too,
had
wandered
off
to
look
for
any
information
that
might
help
the
CIA
save
Peter.
Unable
to
sit
idly,
Katherine
pulled
herself
to
her
feet,
teetered,
and
then
inched
slowly
toward
the
living
room.
She
found
Bellamy
in
the
study.
The
Architect
was
standing
at
an
open
drawer,
his
back
to
her,
apparently
too
engrossed
in
its
contents
to
hear
her
enter.
She
walked
up
behind
him.
"Warren?"
The
old
man
lurched
and
turned,
quickly
shutting
the
drawer
with
his
hip.
His
face
was
lined
with
shock
and
grief,
his
cheeks
streaked
with
tears.
"What's
wrong?!"
She
glanced
down
at
the
drawer.
"What
is
it?"
Bellamy
seemed
unable
to
speak.
He
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
had
just
seen
something
he
deeply
wished
he
had
not.
"What's
in
the
drawer?"
she
demanded.
Bellamy's
tear-
filled
eyes
held
hers
for
a
long,
sorrowful
moment.
Finally
he
spoke.
"You
and
I
wondered
why
why
this
man
seemed
to
hate
your
family."
Katherine'
s
brow
furrowed.
"Yes?"
"Well"
Bellamy's
voice
caught.
"I
just
found
the
answer."
In
the
chamber
at
the
top
of
the
House
of
the
Temple,
the
one
who
called
himself
Mal'akh
stood
before
the
great
altar
and
gently
massaged
the
virgin
skin
atop
his
head.
Verbum
significatium,
he
chanted
in
preparation.
Verbum
omnificum.
The
final
ingredient
had
been
found
at
last.
The
most
precious
treasures
are
often
the
simplest.
Above
the
altar,
wisps
of
fragrant
smoke
now
swirled,
billowing
up
from
the
censer.
The
suffumigations
ascended
through
the
shaft
of
moonlight,
clearing
a
channel
skyward
through
which
a
liberated
soul
could
travel
freely.
The
time
had
come.
Mal'akh
retrieved
the
vial
of
Peter's
darkened
blood
and
uncorked
it.
With
his
captive
looking
on,
he
dipped
the
nib
of
the
crow's
feather
into
the
crimson
tincture
and
raised
it
to
the
sacred
circle
of
flesh
atop
his
head.
He
paused
a
moment
thinking
of
how
long
he
had
waited
for
this
night.
His
great
transformation
was
finally
at
hand.
When
the
Lost
Word
is
written
on
the
mind
of
man,
he
is
then
ready
to
receive
unimaginable
power.
Such
was
the
ancient
promise
of
apotheosis.
So
far,
mankind
had
been
unable
to
realize
that
promise,
and
Mal'akh
had
done
what
he
could
to
keep
it
that
way.
With
a
steady
hand,
Mal'akh
touched
the
nib
of
the
feather
to
his
skin.
He
needed
no
mirror,
no
assistance,
only
his
sense
of
touch,
and
his
mind's
eye.
Slowly,
meticulously,
he
began
inscribing
the
Lost
Word
inside
the
circular
ouroboros
on
his
scalp.
Peter
Solomon
looked
on
with
an
expression
of
horror.
When
Mal'akh
finished,
he
closed
his
eyes,
set
down
the
feather,
and
let
the
air
out
of
his
lungs
entirely.
For
the
first
time
in
his
life,
he
felt
a
sensation
he
had
never
known.
/
am
complete.
I
am
at
one.
Mal'akh
had
worked
for
years
on
the
artifact
that
was
his
body,
and
now,
as
he
neared
his
moment
of
final
transformation,
he
could
feel
every
line
that
had
ever
been
inscribed
on
his
flesh.
I
am
a
true
masterpiece.
Perfect
and
complete.
"I
gave
you
what
you
asked
for."
Peter's
voice
intruded.
"Send
help
to
Katherine.
And
stop
that
file."
Mal'akh
opened
his
eyes
and
smiled.
"You
and
I
are
not
quite
finished."
He
turned
to
the
altar
and
picked
up
the
sacrificial
knife,
running
his
finger
across
the
sleek
iron
blade.
"This
ancient
knife
was
commissioned
by
God,"
he
said,
"for
use
in
a
human
sacrifice.
You
recognized
it
earlier,
no?"
Solomon's
gray
eyes
were
like
stone.
"It
is
unique,
and
I've
heard
the
legend."
"Legend?
The
account
appears
in
Holy
Scripture.
You
don't
believe
it's
true?"
Peter
just
stared.
Mal'akh
had
spent
a
fortune
locating
and
obtaining
this
artifact.
Known
as
the
Akedah
knife,
it
had
been
crafted
over
three
thousand
years
ago
from
an
iron
meteorite
that
had
fallen
to
earth.
Iron
from
heaven,
as
the
early
mystics
called
it.
It
was
believed
to
be
the
exact
knife
used
by
Abraham
at
the
Akedah
the
near
sacrifice
of
his
son
Isaac
on
Mount
Moriah
as
depicted
in
Genesis.
The
knife's
astounding
history
included
possession
by
popes,
Nazi
mystics,
European
alchemists,
and
private
collectors.
They
protected
and
admired
it,
Mal'akh
thought,
but
none
dared
unleash
its
true
power
by
using
it
for
its
real
purpose.
Tonight,
the
Akedah
knife
would
fulfill
its
destiny.
The
Akedah
had
always
been
sacred
in
Masonic
ritual.
In
the
very
first
degree,
Masons
celebrated
"the
most
august
gift
ever
offered
to
God
the
submission
of
Abraham
to
the
volitions
of
the
supreme
being
by
proffering
Isaac,
his
firstborn"
The
weight
of
the
blade
felt
exhilarating
in
Mal'akh's
hand
as
he
crouched
down
and
used
the
freshly
sharpened
knife
to
sever
the
ropes
binding
Peter
to
his
wheelchair.
The
bonds
fell
to
the
floor.
Peter
Solomon
winced
in
pain
as
he
attempted
to
shift
his
cramped
limbs.
"Why
are
you
doing
this
to
me?
What
do
you
think
this
will
accomplish?"
"You
of
all
people
should
understand,"
Mal'akh
replied.
"You
study
the
ancient
ways.
You
know
that
the
power
of
the
mysteries
relies
on
sacrifice
on
releasing
a
human
soul
from
its
body.
It
has
been
this
way
since
the
beginning."
"You
know
nothing
of
sacrifice,"
Peter
said,
his
voice
seething
with
pain
and
loathing.
Excellent,
Mal'akh
thought.
Feed
your
hatred.
It
will
only
make
this
easier.
Mal'akh's
empty
stomach
growled
as
he
paced
before
his
captive.
"There
is
enormous
power
in
the
shedding
of
human
blood.
Everyone
understood
that,
from
the
early
Egyptians,
to
the
Celtic
Druids,
to
the
Chinese,
to
the
Aztecs.
There
is
magic
in
human
sacrifice,
but
modern
man
has
become
weak,
too
fearful
to
make
true
offerings,
too
frail
to
give
the
life
that
is
required
for
spiritual
transformation.
The
ancient
texts
are
clear,
though.
Only
by
offering
what
is
most
sacred
can
man
access
the
ultimate
power."
"You
consider
me
a
sacred
offering?"
Mal'akh
now
laughed
out
loud.
"You
really
don't
understand
yet,
do
you?"
Peter
gave
him
an
odd
look.
"Do
you
know
why
I
have
a
deprivation
tank
in
my
home?"
Mal'akh
placed
his
hands
on
his
hips
and
flexed
his
elaborately
decorated
body,
which
was
still
covered
only
by
a
loincloth.
"I
have
been
practicing
preparing
anticipating
the
moment
when
I
am
only
mind
when
I
am
released
from
this
mortal
shell
.
.
.
when
I
have
offered
up
this
beautiful
body
to
the
gods
in
sacrifice.
/
am
the
precious
one!
/
am
the
pure
white
lamb!"
Peter'
s
mouth
fell
open
but
no
words
came
out.
"Yes,
Peter,
a
man
must
offer
to
the
gods
that
which
he
holds
most
dear.
His
purest
white
dove
his
most
precious
and
worthy
offering.
You
are
not
precious
to
me.
You
are
not
a
worthy
offering."
Mal'akh
glared
at
him.
"Don't
you
see?
You
are
not
the
sacrifice,
Peter
/
am.
Mine
is
the
flesh
that
is
the
offering.
/
am
the
gift.
Look
at
me.
I
have
prepared,
made
myself
worthy
for
my
final
journey.
/
am
the
gift!"
Peter
remained
speechless.
"The
secret
is
how
to
die,"
Mal'akh
now
said.
"Masons
understand
that."
He
pointed
to
the
altar.
"You
revere
the
ancient
truths,
and
yet
you
are
cowards.
You
understand
the
power
of
sacrifice
and
yet
you
keep
a
safe
distance
from
death,
performing
your
mock
murders
and
bloodless
death
rituals.
Tonight,
your
symbolic
altar
will
bear
witness
to
its
true
power
and
its
actual
purpose."
Mal'akh
reached
down
and
grasped
Peter
Solomon's
left
hand,
pressing
the
handle
of
the
Akedah
knife
into
his
palm.
The
left
hand
serves
the
darkness.
This,
too,
had
been
planned.
Peter
would
have
no
choice
in
the
matter.
Mal'akh
could
fathom
no
sacrifice
more
potent
and
symbolic
than
one
performed
on
this
altar,
by
this
man,
with
this
knife,
plunged
into
the
heart
of
an
offering
whose
mortal
flesh
was
wrapped
like
a
gift
in
a
shroud
of
mystical
symbols.
With
this
offering
of
self,
Mal'akh
would
establish
his
rank
in
the
hierarchy
of
demons.
Darkness
and
blood
were
where
the
true
power
lay.
The
ancients
knew
this,
the
Adepts
choosing
sides
consistent
with
their
individual
natures.
Mal'akh
had
chosen
sides
wisely.
Chaos
was
the
natural
law
of
the
universe.
Indifference
was
the
engine
of
entropy.
Man's
apathy
was
the
fertile
ground
in
which
the
dark
spirits
tended
their
seeds.
/
have
served
them,
and
they
will
receive
me
as
a
god.
Peter
did
not
move.
He
simply
stared
down
at
the
ancient
knife
gripped
in
his
hand.
"I
will
you,"
Mal'akh
taunted.
"I
am
a
willing
sacrifice.
Your
final
role
has
been
written.
You
will
transform
me.
You
will
liberate
me
from
my
body.
You
will
do
this,
or
you
will
lose
your
sister
and
your
brotherhood.
You
will
truly
be
all
alone."
He
paused,
smiling
down
at
his
captive.
"Consider
this
your
final
punishment."
Peter's
eyes
rose
slowly
to
meet
Mal'akh's.
"Killing
you!
A
punishment!
Do
you
think
I
will
hesitate?
You
murdered
my
son.
My
mother.
My
entire
family."
"No!"
Mal'akh
exploded
with
a
force
that
startled
even
himself.
"You
are
wrong!
I
did
not
murder
your
family!
You
did!
It
was
you
who
made
the
choice
to
leave
Zachary
in
prison!
And
from
there,
the
wheels
were
in
motion!
You
killed
your
family,
Peter,
not
me!"
Peter's
knuckles
turned
white,
his
fingers
clenching
the
knife
in
rage.
"You
know
nothing
of
why
I
left
Zachary
in
prison."
"I
know
everything!"
Mal'akh
fired
back.
"I
was
there.
You
claimed
you
were
trying
to
help
him.
Were
you
trying
to
help
him
when
you
offered
him
the
choice
between
wealth
or
wisdom?
Were
you
trying
to
help
him
when
you
gave
him
the
ultimatum
to
join
the
Masons?
What
kind
of
father
gives
a
child
the
choice
between
'wealth
or
wisdom'
and
expects
him
to
know
how
to
handle
it!
What
kind
of
father
leaves
his
own
son
in
a
prison
instead
of
flying
him
home
to
safety!"
Mal'akh
now
moved
in
front
of
Peter
and
crouched
down,
placing
his
tattooed
face
only
inches
from
his
face.
"But
most
important
what
kind
of
father
can
look
his
own
son
in
the
eyes
even
after
all
these
years
and
not
even
recognize
him!"
Mal'akh's
words
echoed
for
several
seconds
in
the
stone
chamber.
Then
silence.
In
the
abrupt
stillness,
Peter
Solomon
seemed
to
have
been
jolted
from
his
trance.
His
face
clouded
now
with
a
visage
of
total
incredulity.
Yes,
Father.
It's
me.
Mal'akh
had
waited
years
for
this
moment
to
take
revenge
on
the
man
who
had
abandoned
him
to
stare
into
those
gray
eyes
and
speak
the
truth
that
had
been
buried
all
these
years.
Now
the
moment
was
here,
and
he
spoke
slowly,
longing
to
watch
the
full
weight
of
his
words
gradually
crush
Peter
Solomon's
soul.
"You
should
be
happy,
Father.
Your
prodigal
son
has
returned."
Peter's
face
was
now
as
pale
as
death.
Mal'akh
savored
every
moment.
"My
own
father
made
the
decision
to
leave
me
in
prison
and
in
that
instant,
I
vowed
that
he
had
rejected
me
for
the
last
time.
I
was
no
longer
his
son.
Zachary
Solomon
ceased
to
exist."
Two
glistening
teardrops
welled
suddenly
in
his
father's
eyes,
and
Mal'akh
thought
they
were
the
most
beautiful
thing
he
had
ever
seen.
Peter
choked
back
tears,
staring
up
at
Mal'akh's
face
as
if
seeing
him
for
the
very
first
time.
"All
the
warden
wanted
was
money,"
Mal'akh
said,
"but
you
refused.
It
never
occurred
to
you,
though,
that
my
money
was
just
as
green
as
yours.
The
warden
did
not
care
who
paid
him,
only
that
he
was
paid.
When
I
offered
to
pay
him
handsomely,
he
selected
a
sickly
inmate
about
my
size,
dressed
him
in
my
clothes,
and
beat
him
beyond
all
recognition.
The
photos
you
saw
and
the
sealed
casket
you
buried
they
were
not
mine.
They
belonged
to
a
stranger."
Peter's
tear-streaked
face
contorted
now
with
anguish
and
disbelief.
"Oh
my
God
Zachary."
"Not
anymore.
When
Zachary
walked
out
of
prison,
he
was
transformed."
His
adolescent
physique
and
childlike
face
had
drastically
mutated
when
he
flooded
his
young
body
with
experimental
growth
hormones
and
steroids.
Even
his
vocal
cords
had
been
ravaged,
transforming
his
boyish
voice
into
a
permanent
whisper.
Zachary
became
Andros.
Andros
became
Mal'akh.
And
tonight
Mal'akh
will
become
his
greatest
incarnation
of
all.
At
that
moment
in
Kalorama
Heights,
Katherine
Solomon
stood
over
the
open
desk
drawer
and
gazed
down
at
what
could
be
described
only
as
a
fetishist's
collection
of
old
newspaper
articles
and
photographs.
"I
don't
understand,"
she
said,
turning
to
Bellamy.
"This
lunatic
was
obviously
obsessed
with
my
family,
but"
"Keep
going"
urged
Bellamy,
taking
a
seat
and
still
looking
deeply
shaken.
Katherine
dug
deeper
into
the
newspaper
articles,
every
one
of
which
related
to
the
Solomon
family
Peter's
many
successes,
Katherine'
s
research,
their
mother
Isabel's
terrible
murder,
Zachary
Solomon's
widely
publicized
drug
use,
incarceration,
and
brutal
murder
in
a
Turkish
prison.
The
fixation
this
man
had
on
the
Solomon
family
was
beyond
fanatical,
and
yet
Katherine
saw
nothing
yet
to
suggest
why.
It
was
then
that
she
saw
the
photographs.
The
first
showed
Zachary
standing
knee-deep
in
azure
water
on
a
beach
dotted
with
whitewashed
houses.
Greece?
The
photo,
she
assumed,
could
have
been
taken
only
during
Zach's
freewheeling
drug
days
in
Europe.
Strangely,
though,
Zach
looked
healthier
than
he
did
in
the
paparazzi
shots
of
an
emaciated
kid
partying
with
the
drug
crowd.
He
looked
more
fit,
stronger
somehow,
more
mature.
Katherine
never
recalled
him
looking
so
healthy.
Puzzled,
she
checked
the
date
stamp
on
the
photo.
But
that's
impossible.
The
date
was
almost
a
full
year
after
Zachary
had
died
in
prison.
Suddenly
Katherine
was
flipping
desperately
through
the
stack.
All
of
the
photos
were
of
Zachary
Solomon
.
.
.
gradually
getting
older.
The
collection
appeared
to
be
some
kind
of
pictorial
autobiography,
chronicling
a
slow
transformation.
As
the
pictures
progressed,
Katherine
saw
a
sudden
and
dramatic
change.
She
looked
on
in
horror
as
Zachary'
s
body
began
mutating,
his
muscles
bulging,
and
his
facial
features
morphing
from
the
obvious
heavy
use
of
steroids.
His
frame
seemed
to
double
in
mass,
and
a
haunting
fierceness
crept
into
his
eyes.
/
don
't
even
recognize
this
man!
He
looked
nothing
like
Katherine'
s
memories
of
her
young
nephew.
When
she
reached
a
picture
of
him
with
a
shaved
head,
she
felt
her
knees
begin
to
buckle.
Then
she
saw
a
photo
of
his
bare
body
adorned
with
the
first
traces
of
tattoos.
Her
heart
almost
stopped.
"Oh
my
God"
"Right
turn!"
Langdon
shouted
from
the
backseat
of
the
commandeered
Lexus
SUV.
Simkins
swerved
onto
S
Street
and
gunned
the
vehicle
through
a
tree-lined
residential
neighborhood.
As
they
neared
the
corner
of
Sixteenth
Street,
the
House
of
the
Temple
rose
like
a
mountain
on
the
right.
Simkins
stared
up
at
the
massive
structure.
It
looked
like
someone
had
built
a
pyramid
on
top
of
Rome's
Pantheon.
He
prepared
to
turn
right
on
Sixteenth
toward
the
front
of
the
building.
"Don't
turn!"
Langdon
ordered.
"Go
straight!
Stay
on
S!"
Simkins
obeyed,
driving
alongside
the
east
side
of
the
building.
"At
Fifteenth,"
Langdon
said,
"turn
right!"
Simkins
followed
his
navigator,
and
moments
later,
Langdon
had
pointed
out
a
nearly
invisible,
unpaved
access
road
that
bisected
the
gardens
behind
the
House
of
the
Temple.
Simkins
turned
in
to
the
drive
and
gunned
the
Lexus
toward
the
rear
of
the
building.
"Look!"
Langdon
said,
pointing
to
the
lone
vehicle
parked
near
the
rear
entrance.
It
was
a
large
van.
"They're
here."
Simkins
parked
the
SUV
and
killed
the
engine.
Quietly,
everyone
got
out
and
prepared
to
move
in.
Simkins
stared
up
at
the
monolithic
structure.
"You
say
the
Temple
Room
is
at
the
topT
Langdon
nodded,
pointing
all
the
way
to
the
pinnacle
of
the
building.
"That
flat
area
on
top
of
the
pyramid
is
actually
a
skylight."
Simkins
spun
back
to
Langdon.
"The
Temple
Room
has
a
skylight?'
Langdon
gave
him
an
odd
look.
"Of
course.
An
oculus
to
heaven
directly
above
the
altar."
The
UH-60
sat
idling
at
Dupont
Circle.
In
the
passenger
seat,
Sato
gnawed
at
her
fingernails,
awaiting
news
from
her
team.
Finally,
Simkins's
voice
crackled
over
the
radio.
"Director?"
"Sato
here,"
she
barked.
"We're
entering
the
building,
but
I
have
some
additional
recon
for
you."
"Go
ahead."
"Mr.
Langdon
just
informed
me
that
the
room
in
which
the
target
is
most
likely
located
has
a
very
large
skylight."
Sato
considered
the
information
for
several
seconds.
"Understood.
Thank
you."
Simkins
signed
off.
Sato
spit
out
a
fingernail
and
turned
to
the
pilot.
"Take
her
up."
Like
any
parent
who
had
lost
a
child,
Peter
Solomon
had
often
imagined
how
old
his
boy
would
be
now
what
he
would
look
like
and
what
he
would
have
become.
Peter
Solomon
now
had
his
answers.
The
massive
tattooed
creature
before
him
had
begun
life
as
a
tiny,
precious
infant
baby
Zach
curled
up
in
a
wicker
bassinette
taking
his
first
fumbling
steps
across
Peter's
study
learning
to
speak
his
first
words.
The
fact
that
evil
could
spring
from
an
innocent
child
in
a
loving
family
remained
one
of
the
paradoxes
of
the
human
soul.
Peter
had
been
forced
to
accept
early
on
that
although
his
own
blood
flowed
in
his
son's
veins,
the
heart
pumping
that
blood
was
his
son's
own.
Unique
and
singular
as
if
randomly
chosen
from
the
universe.
My
son
he
killed
my
mother,
my
friend
Robert
Langdon,
and
possibly
my
sister.
An
icy
numbness
flooded
Peter's
heart
as
he
searched
his
son's
eyes
for
any
connection
anything
familiar.
The
man's
eyes,
however,
although
gray
like
Peter's,
were
those
of
a
total
stranger,
filled
with
a
hatred
and
a
vengefulness
that
were
almost
otherworldly.
"Are
you
strong
enough?"
his
son
taunted,
glancing
at
the
Akedah
knife
gripped
in
Peter's
hand.
"Can
you
finish
what
you
started
all
those
years
ago?"
"Son"
Solomon
barely
recognized
his
own
voice.
"I
I
loved
you."
"Twice
you
tried
to
kill
me.
You
abandoned
me
in
prison.
You
shot
me
on
Zach's
bridge.
Now
finish
it!"
For
an
instant,
Solomon
felt
like
he
was
floating
outside
his
own
body.
He
no
longer
recognized
himself.
He
was
missing
a
hand,
was
totally
bald,
dressed
in
a
black
robe,
sitting
in
a
wheelchair,
and
clutching
an
ancient
knife.
"Finish
it!"
the
man
shouted
again,
the
tattoos
on
his
naked
chest
rippling.
"Killing
me
is
the
only
way
you
can
save
Katherine
the
only
way
to
save
your
brotherhood!"
Solomon
felt
his
gaze
move
to
the
laptop
and
cellular
modem
on
the
pigskin
chair.
SENDING
MESSAGE:
92%
COMPLETE
His
mind
could
not
shake
the
images
of
Katherine
bleeding
to
death
or
of
his
Masonic
brothers.
"There
is
still
time,"
the
man
whispered.
"You
know
it's
the
only
choice.
Release
me
from
my
mortal
shell."
"Please,"
Solomon
said.
"Don't
do
this"
'Tow
did
this!"
the
man
hissed.
"You
forced
your
child
to
make
an
impossible
choice!
Do
you
remember
that
night?
Wealth
or
wisdom?
That
was
the
night
you
pushed
me
away
forever.
But
Eve
returned,
Father
and
tonight
it
is
your
turn
to
choose.
Zachary
or
Katherine?
Which
will
it
be?
Will
you
kill
your
son
to
save
your
sister?
Will
you
kill
your
son
to
save
your
brotherhood?
Your
country?
Or
will
you
wait
until
it's
too
late?
Until
Katherine
is
dead
until
the
video
is
public
until
you
must
live
the
rest
of
your
life
knowing
you
could
have
stopped
these
tragedies.
Time
is
running
out.
You
know
what
must
be
done."
Peter's
heart
ached.
You
are
not
Zachary,
he
told
himself.
Zachary
died
long,
long
ago.
Whatever
you
are
and
wherever
you
came
from
you
are
not
of
me.
And
although
Peter
Solomon
did
not
believe
his
own
words,
he
knew
he
had
to
make
a
choice.
He
was
out
of
time.
Find
the
Grand
Staircase!
Robert
Langdon
dashed
through
darkened
hallways,
winding
his
way
toward
the
center
of
the
building.
Turner
Simkins
remained
close
on
his
heels.
As
Langdon
had
hoped,
he
burst
out
into
the
building's
main
atrium.
Dominated
by
eight
Doric
columns
of
green
granite,
the
atrium
looked
like
a
hybrid
sepulcher
Greco-
Roman-Egyptian
with
black
marble
statues,
chandelier
fire
bowls,
Teutonic
crosses,
double-headed
phoenix
medallions,
and
sconces
bearing
the
head
of
Hermes.
Langdon
turned
and
ran
toward
the
sweeping
marble
staircase
at
the
far
end
of
the
atrium.
"This
leads
directly
to
the
Temple
Room,"
he
whispered
as
the
two
men
ascended
as
quickly
and
quietly
as
possible.
On
the
first
landing,
Langdon
came
face-to-face
with
a
bronze
bust
of
Masonic
luminary
Albert
Pike,
along
with
the
engraving
of
his
most
famous
quote:
WHAT
WE
HAVE
DONE
FOR
OURSELVES
ALONE
DIES
WITH
US;
WHAT
WE
HAVE
DONE
FOR
OTHERS
AND
THE
WORLD
REMAINS
AND
IS
IMMORTAL.
Mal'akh
had
sensed
a
palpable
shift
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
Temple
Room,
as
if
all
the
frustration
and
pain
Peter
Solomon
had
ever
felt
was
now
boiling
to
the
surface
focusing
itself
like
a
laser
on
Mal'akh.
Yes
it
is
time.
Peter
Solomon
had
risen
from
his
wheelchair
and
was
standing
now,
facing
the
altar,
gripping
the
knife.
"Save
Katherine,"
Mal'akh
coaxed,
luring
him
toward
the
altar,
backing
up,
and
finally
laying
his
own
body
down
on
the
white
shroud
he
had
prepared.
"Do
what
you
need
to
do."
As
if
moving
through
a
nightmare,
Peter
inched
forward.
Mal'akh
reclined
fully
now
onto
his
back,
gazing
up
through
the
oculus
at
the
wintry
moon.
The
secret
is
how
to
die.
This
moment
could
not
be
any
more
perfect.
Adorned
with
the
Lost
Word
of
the
ages,
I
offer
myself
by
the
left
hand
of
my
father.
Mal'akh
drew
a
deep
breath.
Receive
me,
demons,
for
this
is
my
body,
which
is
offered
for
you.
Standing
over
Mal'akh,
Peter
Solomon
was
trembling.
His
tear-soaked
eyes
shone
with
desperation,
indecision,
anguish.
He
looked
one
last
time
toward
the
modem
and
laptop
across
the
room.
"Make
the
choice,"
Mal'akh
whispered.
"Release
me
from
my
flesh.
God
wants
this.
You
want
this."
He
laid
his
arms
at
his
side
and
arched
his
chest
forward,
offering
up
his
magnificent
double-headed
phoenix.
Help
me
shed
the
body
that
clothes
my
soul.
Peter's
tearful
eyes
seemed
to
be
staring
through
Mal'akh
now,
not
even
seeing
him.
"I
killed
your
mother!"
Mal'akh
whispered.
"I
killed
Robert
Langdon!
I'm
murdering
your
sister!
I'm
destroying
your
brotherhood!
Do
what
you
have
to
do!"
Peter
Solomon's
visage
now
contorted
into
a
mask
of
absolute
grief
and
regret.
He
threw
his
head
back
and
screamed
in
anguish
as
he
raised
the
knife.
Robert
Langdon
and
Agent
Simkins
arrived
breathless
outside
the
Temple
Room
doors
as
a
bloodcurdling
scream
erupted
from
within.
It
was
Peter's
voice.
Langdon
was
certain.
Peter's
cry
was
one
of
absolute
agony.
I'm
too
late!
Ignoring
Simkins,
Langdon
seized
the
handles
and
yanked
open
the
doors.
The
horrific
scene
before
him
confirmed
his
worst
fears.
There,
in
the
center
of
the
dimly
lit
chamber,
the
silhouette
of
a
man
with
a
shaved
head
stood
at
the
great
altar.
He
wore
a
black
robe,
and
his
hand
was
clutching
a
large
blade.
Before
Langdon
could
move,
the
man
was
driving
the
knife
down
toward
the
body
that
lay
outstretched
on
the
altar.
Marakh
had
closed
his
eyes.
So
beautiful.
So
perfect.
The
ancient
blade
of
the
Akedah
knife
had
glinted
in
the
moonlight
as
it
arched
over
him.
Scented
wisps
of
smoke
had
spiraled
upward
above
him,
preparing
a
pathway
for
his
soon-to-be-liberated
soul.
His
killer's
lone
scream
of
torment
and
desperation
still
rang
through
the
sacred
space
as
the
knife
came
down.
/
am
besmeared
with
the
blood
of
human
sacrifice
and
parents
'
tears.
Mal'akh
braced
for
the
glorious
impact.
His
moment
of
transformation
had
arrived.
Incredibly,
he
felt
no
pain.
A
thunderous
vibration
filled
his
body,
deafening
and
deep.
The
room
began
shaking,
and
a
brilliant
white
light
blinded
him
from
above.
The
heavens
roared.
And
Mal'akh
knew
it
had
happened.
Exactly
as
he
had
planned.
Langdon
did
not
remember
sprinting
toward
the
altar
as
the
helicopter
appeared
overhead.
Nor
did
he
remember
leaping
with
his
arms
out-
stretched
soaring
toward
the
man
in
the
black
robe
trying
desperately
to
tackle
him
before
he
could
plunge
the
knife
down
a
second
time.
Their
bodies
collided,
and
Langdon
saw
a
bright
light
sweep
down
through
the
oculus
and
illuminate
the
altar.
He
expected
to
see
the
bloody
body
of
Peter
Solomon
on
the
altar,
but
the
naked
chest
that
shone
in
the
light
had
no
blood
on
it
at
all
only
a
tapestry
of
tattoos.
The
knife
lay
broken
beside
him,
apparently
having
been
driven
into
the
stone
altar
rather
than
into
flesh.
As
he
and
the
man
in
the
black
robe
crashed
together
onto
the
hard
stone
floor,
Langdon
saw
the
bandaged
nub
on
the
end
of
the
man's
right
arm,
and
he
realized
to
his
bewilderment
that
he
had
just
tackled
Peter
Solomon.
As
they
slid
together
across
the
stone
floor,
the
helicopter'
s
searchlights
blazed
down
from
above.
The
chopper
thundered
in
low,
its
skids
practically
touching
the
expansive
wall
of
glass.
On
the
front
of
the
helicopter,
a
strange-looking
gun
rotated,
aiming
downward
through
the
glass.
The
red
beam
of
its
laser
scope
sliced
through
the
skylight
and
danced
across
the
floor,
directly
toward
Langdon
and
Solomon.
No!
But
there
was
no
gunfire
from
above
only
the
sound
of
the
helicopter
blades.
Langdon
felt
nothing
but
an
eerie
ripple
of
energy
that
shimmered
through
his
cells.
Behind
his
head,
on
the
pigskin
chair,
the
laptop
hissed
strangely.
He
spun
in
time
to
see
its
screen
suddenly
flash
to
black.
Unfortunately,
the
last
visible
message
had
been
clear.
SENDING
MESSAGE:
100%
COMPLETE
Pull
up!
Damn
it!
Up!
The
UH-60
pilot
threw
his
rotors
into
overdrive,
trying
to
keep
his
skids
from
touching
any
part
of
the
large
glass
skylight.
He
knew
the
six
thousand
pounds
of
lift
force
that
surged
downward
from
his
rotors
was
already
straining
the
glass
to
its
breaking
point.
Unfortunately,
the
incline
of
the
pyramid
beneath
the
helicopter
was
efficiently
shedding
the
thrust
sideways,
robbing
him
of
lift.
Up!
Now!
He
tipped
the
nose,
trying
to
skim
away,
but
the
left
strut
hit
the
center
of
the
glass.
It
was
only
for
an
instant,
but
that
was
all
it
took.
The
Temple
Room's
massive
oculus
exploded
in
a
swirl
of
glass
and
wind
sending
a
torrent
of
jagged
shards
plummeting
into
the
room
below.
Stars
falling
from
heaven.
Mal'akh
stared
up
into
the
beautiful
white
light
and
saw
a
veil
of
shimmering
jewels
fluttering
toward
him
.
.
.
accelerating
as
if
racing
to
shroud
him
in
their
splendor.
Suddenly
there
was
pain.
Everywhere.
Stabbing.
Searing.
Slashing.
Razor-sharp
knives
piercing
soft
flesh.
Chest,
neck,
thighs,
face.
His
body
tightened
all
at
once,
recoiling.
His
blood-filled
mouth
cried
out
as
the
pain
ripped
him
from
his
trance.
The
white
light
above
transformed
itself,
and
suddenly,
as
if
by
magic,
a
dark
helicopter
was
suspended
above
him,
its
thundering
blades
driving
an
icy
wind
down
into
the
Temple
Room,
chilling
Mal'akh
to
the
core
and
dispersing
the
wisps
of
incense
to
the
distant
corners
of
the
room.
Mal'akh
turned
his
head
and
saw
the
Akedah
knife
lying
broken
by
his
side,
smashed
upon
the
granite
altar,
which
was
covered
in
a
blanket
of
shattered
glass.
Even
after
everything
I
did
to
him
Peter
Solomon
averted
the
knife.
He
refused
to
spill
my
blood.
With
welling
horror,
Mal'akh
raised
his
head
and
peered
down
along
the
length
of
his
own
body.
This
living
artifact
was
to
have
been
his
great
offering.
But
it
lay
in
tatters.
His
body
was
drenched
in
blood
huge
shards
of
glass
protruding
from
his
flesh
in
all
directions.
Weakly,
Mal'akh
lowered
his
head
back
to
the
granite
altar
and
stared
up
through
the
open
space
in
the
roof.
The
helicopter
was
gone
now,
in
its
place
a
silent,
wintry
moon.
Wide-eyed,
Mal'akh
lay
gasping
for
breath
all
alone
on
the
great
altar.
The
secret
is
how
to
die.
Mal'akh
knew
it
had
all
gone
wrong.
There
was
no
brilliant
light.
No
wondrous
reception.
Only
darkness
and
excruciating
pain.
Even
in
his
eyes.
He
could
see
nothing,
and
yet
he
sensed
movement
all
around
him.
There
were
voices
human
voices
one
of
them,
strangely,
belonging
to
Robert
Langdon.
How
can
this
be?
"She's
okay,"
Langdon
kept
repeating.
"Katherine
is
fine,
Peter.
Your
sister
is
okay."
No,
Mal'akh
thought.
Katherine
is
dead.
She
must
be.
Mal'akh
could
no
longer
see,
could
not
tell
if
his
eyes
were
even
open,
but
he
heard
the
helicopter
banking
away.
An
abrupt
calm
settled
through
the
Temple
Room.
Mal'akh
could
feel
the
smooth
rhythms
of
the
earth
becoming
uneven
as
if
the
ocean's
natural
tides
were
being
disrupted
by
a
gathering
storm.
Chao
ab
ordo.
Unfamiliar
voices
were
shouting
now,
talking
urgently
with
Langdon
about
the
laptop
and
video
file.
It's
too
late,
Mal'akh
knew.
The
damage
is
done.
By
now
the
video
was
spreading
like
wildfire
into
every
corner
of
a
shocked
world,
destroying
the
future
of
the
brotherhood.
Those
most
capable
of
spreading
the
wisdom
must
be
destroyed.
The
ignorance
of
mankind
is
what
helped
the
chaos
grow.
The
absence
of
Light
on
earth
is
what
nourished
the
Darkness
that
awaited
Mal'akh.
/
have
done
great
deeds,
and
soon
I
will
be
received
as
a
king.
Mal'akh
sensed
that
a
lone
individual
had
quietly
approached.
He
knew
who
it
was.
He
could
smell
the
sacred
oils
he
had
rubbed
into
his
father's
shaved
body.
"I
don't
know
if
you
can
hear
me,"
Peter
Solomon
whispered
in
his
ear.
"But
I
want
you
to
know
something."
He
touched
a
finger
to
the
sacred
spot
atop
Mal'akh's
skull.
"What
you
wrote
here"
He
paused.
"This
is
not
the
Lost
Word."
Of
course
it
is,
Mal'akh
thought.
You
convinced
me
of
that
beyond
a
doubt.
According
to
legend,
the
Lost
Word
was
written
in
a
language
so
ancient
and
arcane
that
mankind
had
all
but
forgotten
how
to
read
it.
This
mysterious
language,
Peter
had
revealed,
was
in
fact
the
oldest
language
on
earth.
The
language
of
symbols.
In
the
idiom
of
symbology,
there
was
one
symbol
that
reigned
supreme
above
all
others.
The
oldest
and
most
universal,
this
symbol
fused
all
the
ancient
traditions
in
a
single
solitary
image
that
represented
the
illumination
of
the
Egyptian
sun
god,
the
triumph
of
alchemical
gold,
the
wisdom
of
the
Philosopher's
Stone,
the
purity
of
the
Rosicrucian
Rose,
the
moment
of
Creation,
the
All,
the
dominance
of
the
astrological
sun,
and
even
the
omniscient
all-seeing
eye
that
hovered
atop
the
unfinished
pyramid.
The
circumpunct.
The
symbol
of
the
Source.
The
origin
of
all
things.
This
is
what
Peter
had
told
him
moments
ago.
Mal'akh
had
been
skeptical
at
first,
but
then
he
had
looked
again
at
the
grid,
realizing
that
the
image
of
the
pyramid
was
pointing
directly
at
the
lone
symbol
of
the
circumpunct
a
circle
with
a
dot
in
its
center.
The
Masonic
Pyramid
is
a
map,
he
thought,
recalling
the
legend,
which
points
to
the
Lost
Word.
It
seemed
his
father
was
telling
the
truth
after
all.
All
great
truths
are
simple.
The
Lost
Word
is
not
a
word
it
is
a
symbol.
Eagerly,
Mal'akh
had
inscribed
the
great
symbol
of
the
circumpunct
on
his
scalp.
As
he
did
so,
he
felt
an
upwelling
of
power
and
satisfaction.
My
masterpiece
and
offering
are
complete.
The
forces
of
darkness
were
waiting
for
him
now.
He
would
be
rewarded
for
his
work.
This
was
to
be
his
moment
of
glory
And
yet,
at
the
last
instant,
everything
had
gone
horribly
wrong.
Peter
was
still
behind
him
now,
speaking
words
that
Mal'akh
could
barely
fathom.
"I
lied
to
you,"
he
was
saying.
"You
left
me
no
choice.
If
I
had
revealed
to
you
the
true
Lost
Word,
you
would
not
have
believed
me,
nor
would
you
have
understood."
The
Lost
Word
is
not
the
circumpunct?
"The
truth
is,"
said
Peter,
"the
Lost
Word
is
known
to
all
but
recognized
by
very
few."
The
words
echoed
in
Mal'akh's
mind.
"You
remain
incomplete,"
Peter
said,
gently
placing
his
palm
on
top
of
Mal'akh's
head.
"Your
work
is
not
yet
done.
But
wherever
you
are
going,
please
know
this
you
were
loved."
For
some
reason,
the
gentle
touch
of
his
father'
s
hand
felt
like
it
was
burning
through
him
like
a
potent
catalyst
that
was
initiating
a
chemical
reaction
inside
Mal'akh's
body.
Without
warning,
he
felt
a
rush
of
blistering
energy
surging
through
his
physical
shell,
as
if
every
cell
in
his
body
were
now
dissolving.
In
an
instant,
all
of
his
worldly
pain
evaporated.
Transformation.
It's
happening.
I
am
gazing
down
upon
myself,
a
wreck
of
bloody
flesh
on
the
sacred
slab
of
granite.
My
father
is
kneeling
behind
me,
holding
my
lifeless
head
with
his
one
remaining
hand.
I
feel
an
upwelling
of
rage
and
confusion.
This
is
not
a
moment
for
compassion
it
is
for
revenge,
for
transformation
and
yet
still
my
father
refuses
to
submit,
refuses
to
fulfill
his
role,
refuses
to
channel
his
pain
and
anger
through
the
knife
blade
and
into
my
heart.
I
am
trapped
here,
hovering
tethered
to
my
earthly
shell.
My
father
gently
runs
a
soft
palm
across
my
face
to
close
my
fading
eyes.
I
feel
the
tether
release.
A
billowing
veil
materializes
around
me,
thickening
and
dimming
the
light,
hiding
the
world
from
view.
Suddenly
time
accelerates,
and
I
am
plunging
into
an
abyss
far
darker
than
any
I
have
ever
imagined.
Here,
in
the
barren
void,
I
hear
a
whispering
I
sense
a
gathering
force.
It
strengthens,
mounting
at
a
startling
rate,
surrounding
me.
Ominous
and
powerful.
Dark
and
commanding.
I
am
not
alone
here.
This
is
my
triumph,
my
grand
reception.
And
yet,
for
some
reason,
I
am
filled
not
with
joy,
but
rather
with
boundless
fear.
It
is
nothing
like
I
expect.
The
force
is
churning
now,
swirling
around
me
with
commanding
strength,
threatening
to
tear
me
apart.
Suddenly,
without
warning,
the
blackness
gathers
itself
like
a
great
prehistoric
beast
and
rears
up
before
me.
I
am
facing
all
the
dark
souls
who
have
gone
before.
I
am
screaming
in
infinite
terror
as
the
darkness
swallows
me
whole.
Inside
the
National
Cathedral,
Dean
Galloway
sensed
a
strange
change
in
the
air.
He
was
not
sure
why,
but
he
felt
as
if
a
ghostly
shadow
had
evaporated
as
if
a
weight
had
been
lifted
far
away
and
yet
right
here.
Alone
at
his
desk,
he
was
deep
in
thought.
He
was
not
sure
how
many
minutes
had
passed
when
his
phone
rang.
It
was
Warren
Bellamy.
"Peter's
alive,"
his
Masonic
brother
said.
"I
just
heard
the
news.
I
knew
you'd
want
to
know
immediately.
He's
going
to
be
okay."
"Thank
God."
Galloway
exhaled.
"Where
is
he?"
Galloway
listened
as
Bellamy
recounted
the
extraordinary
tale
of
what
had
transpired
after
they
had
left
Cathedral
College.
"But
all
of
you
are
okay?"
"Recuperating,
yes,"
Bellamy
said.
"There
is
one
thing,
though."
He
paused.
"Yes?"
"The
Masonic
Pyramid
I
think
Langdon
may
have
solved
it."
Galloway
had
to
smile.
Somehow
he
was
not
surprised.
"And
tell
me,
did
Langdon
discover
whether
or
not
the
pyramid
kept
its
promise?
Whether
or
not
it
revealed
what
legend
always
claimed
it
would
reveal?"
"I
don't
know
yet."
It
will,
Galloway
thought.
"You
need
to
rest."
"As
do
you."
No,
/
need
to
pray.
When
the
elevator
door
opened,
the
lights
in
the
Temple
Room
were
all
ablaze.
Katherine
Solomon's
legs
still
felt
rubbery
as
she
hurried
in
to
find
her
brother.
The
air
in
this
enormous
chamber
was
cold
and
smelled
of
incense.
The
scene
that
greeted
her
stopped
her
in
her
tracks.
In
the
center
of
this
magnificent
room,
on
a
low
stone
altar,
lay
a
bloody,
tattooed
corpse,
a
body
perforated
by
spears
of
broken
glass.
High
above,
a
gaping
hole
in
the
ceiling
opened
to
the
heavens.
My
God.
Katherine
immediately
looked
away,
her
eyes
scanning
for
Peter.
She
found
her
brother
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
room,
being
tended
to
by
a
medic
while
talking
with
Langdon
and
Director
Sato.
"Peter!"
Katherine
called,
running
over.
"Peter!"
Her
brother
glanced
up,
his
expression
filling
with
relief.
He
was
on
his
feet
at
once,
moving
toward
her.
He
was
wearing
a
simple
white
shirt
and
dark
slacks,
which
someone
had
probably
gotten
for
him
from
his
office
downstairs.
His
right
arm
was
in
a
sling,
and
their
gentle
embrace
was
awkward,
but
Katherine
barely
noticed.
A
familiar
comfort
surrounded
her
like
a
cocoon,
as
it
always
had,
even
in
childhood,
when
her
protective
older
brother
embraced
her.
They
held
each
other
in
silence.
Finally
Katherine
whispered,
"Are
you
okay?
I
mean
really?"
She
released
him,
looking
down
at
the
sling
and
bandage
where
his
right
hand
used
to
be.
Tears
welled
again
in
her
eyes.
"I'm
so
so
sorry."
Peter
shrugged
as
if
it
were
nothing
of
consequence.
"Mortal
flesh.
Bodies
don't
last
forever.
The
important
thing
is
that
you're
okay."
Peter's
lighthearted
response
tore
at
her
emotions,
reminding
her
of
all
the
reasons
she
loved
him.
She
stroked
his
head,
feeling
the
unbreakable
bonds
of
family
the
shared
blood
that
flowed
in
their
veins.
Tragically,
she
knew
there
was
a
third
Solomon
in
the
room
tonight.
The
corpse
on
the
altar
drew
her
gaze,
and
Katherine
shuddered
deeply,
trying
to
block
out
the
photos
she
had
seen.
She
looked
away,
her
eyes
now
finding
Robert
Langdon's.
There
was
compassion
there,
deep
and
perceptive,
as
if
Langdon
somehow
knew
exactly
what
she
was
thinking.
Peter
knows.
Raw
emotion
gripped
Katherine
relief,
sympathy,
despair.
She
felt
her
brother's
body
begin
trembling
like
a
child's.
It
was
something
she
had
never
witnessed
in
her
entire
life.
"Just
let
it
go,"
she
whispered.
"It's
okay.
Just
let
it
go."
Peter'
s
trembling
grew
deeper.
She
held
him
again,
stroking
the
back
of
his
head.
"Peter,
you've
always
been
the
strong
one
you've
always
been
there
for
me.
But
I'm
here
for
you
now.
It's
okay.
I'm
right
here."
Katherine
eased
his
head
gently
onto
her
shoulder
and
the
great
Peter
Solomon
collapsed
sobbing
in
her
arms.
Director
Sato
stepped
away
to
take
an
incoming
call.
It
was
Nola
Kaye.
Her
news,
for
a
change,
was
good.
"Still
no
signs
of
distribution,
ma'am."
She
sounded
hopeful.
"I'm
confident
we
would
have
seen
something
by
now.
It
looks
like
you
contained
it."
Thanks
to
you,
Nola,
Sato
thought,
glancing
down
at
the
laptop,
which
Langdon
had
seen
complete
its
transmission.
A
very
close
call.
At
Nola's
suggestion,
the
agent
searching
the
mansion
had
checked
the
garbage
cans,
discovering
packaging
for
a
newly
purchased
cellular
modem.
With
the
exact
model
number,
Nola
had
been
able
to
cross-reference
compatible
carriers,
bandwidths,
and
service
grids,
isolating
the
laptop's
most
likely
access
node
a
small
transmitter
on
the
corner
of
Sixteenth
and
Corcoran
three
blocks
from
the
Temple.
Nola
quickly
relayed
the
information
to
Sato
in
the
helicopter.
On
approach
toward
the
House
of
the
Temple,
the
pilot
had
performed
a
low-altitude
flyover
and
pulsed
the
relay
node
with
a
blast
of
electromagnetic
radiation,
knocking
it
off-line
only
seconds
before
the
laptop
completed
its
transfer.
"Great
work
tonight,"
Sato
said.
"Now
get
some
sleep.
You've
earned
it."
"Thank
you,
ma'am."
Nola
hesitated.
"Was
there
something
else?"
Nola
was
silent
a
long
moment,
apparently
considering
whether
or
not
to
speak.
"Nothing
that
can't
wait
till
morning,
ma'am.
Have
a
good
night."
In
the
silence
of
an
elegant
bathroom
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
House
of
the
Temple,
Robert
Langdon
ran
warm
water
into
a
tile
sink
and
eyed
himself
in
the
mirror.
Even
in
the
muted
light,
he
looked
like
he
felt
utterly
spent.
His
daybag
was
on
his
shoulder
again,
much
lighter
now
empty
except
for
his
personal
items
and
some
crumpled
lecture
notes.
He
had
to
chuckle.
His
visit
to
D.C.
tonight
to
give
a
lecture
had
turned
out
a
bit
more
grueling
than
he'd
anticipated.
Even
so,
Langdon
had
a
lot
to
be
grateful
for.
Peter
is
alive.
And
the
video
was
contained.
As
Langdon
scooped
handfuls
of
warm
water
onto
his
face,
he
gradually
felt
himself
coming
back
to
life.
Everything
was
still
a
blur,
but
the
adrenaline
in
his
body
was
finally
dissipating
and
he
was
feeling
like
himself
again.
After
drying
his
hands,
he
checked
his
Mickey
Mouse
watch.
My
God,
it's
late.
Langdon
exited
the
bathroom
and
wound
his
way
along
the
curved
wall
of
the
Hall
of
Honor
a
gracefully
arched
passageway,
lined
with
portraits
of
accomplished
Masons
U.S.
presidents,
philanthropists,
luminaries,
and
other
influential
Americans.
He
paused
at
an
oil
painting
of
Harry
S.
Truman
and
tried
to
imagine
the
man
undergoing
the
rites,
rituals,
and
studies
required
to
become
a
Mason.
There
is
a
hidden
world
behind
the
one
we
all
see.
For
all
of
us.
"You
slipped
away,"
a
voice
said
down
the
hall.
Langdon
turned.
It
was
Katherine.
She'd
been
through
hell
tonight,
and
yet
she
looked
suddenly
radiant
rejuvenated
somehow.
Langdon
gave
a
tired
smile.
"How's
he
doing?"
Katherine
walked
up
and
embraced
him
warmly.
"How
can
I
ever
thank
you?"
He
laughed.
"You
know
I
didn't
do
anything,
right?"
Katherine
held
him
for
a
long
time.
"Peter's
going
to
be
fine"
She
let
go
and
looked
deep
into
Langdon'
s
eyes.
"And
he
just
told
me
something
incredible
something
wonderful."
Her
voice
trembled
with
anticipation.
"I
need
to
go
see
it
for
myself.
I'll
be
back
in
a
bit."
"What?
Where
are
you
going?"
"I
won't
be
long.
Right
now,
Peter
wants
to
speak
with
you
alone.
He's
waiting
in
the
library."
"Did
he
say
why?"
Katherine
chuckled
and
shook
her
head.
"You
know
Peter
and
his
secrets."
"But"
"I'll
see
you
in
a
bit."
Then
she
was
gone.
Langdon
sighed
heavily.
He
felt
like
he'd
had
enough
secrets
for
one
night.
There
were
unanswered
questions,
of
course
the
Masonic
Pyramid
and
the
Lost
Word
among
them
but
he
sensed
that
the
answers,
if
they
even
existed,
were
not
for
him.
Not
as
a
non-Mason.
Mustering
the
last
of
his
energy,
Langdon
made
his
way
to
the
Masonic
library.
When
he
arrived,
Peter
was
sitting
all
alone
at
a
table
with
the
stone
pyramid
before
him.
"Robert?"
Peter
smiled
and
waved
him
in.
"I'd
like
a
word."
Langdon
managed
a
grin.
"Yes,
I
hear
you
lost
one."
The
library
in
the
House
of
the
Temple
was
D.C.'s
oldest
public
reading
room.
Its
elegant
stacks
burgeoned
with
over
a
quarter
of
a
million
volumes,
including
a
rare
copy
of
the
Ahiman
Rezon,
The
Secrets
of
a
Prepared
Brother.
In
addition,
the
library
displayed
precious
Masonic
jewels,
ritual
artifacts,
and
even
a
rare
volume
that
had
been
hand-printed
by
Benjamin
Franklin.
Langdon'
s
favorite
library
treasure,
however,
was
one
few
ever
noticed.
The
illusion.
Solomon
had
shown
him
long
ago
that
from
the
proper
vantage
point,
the
library's
reading
desk
and
golden
table
lamp
created
an
unmistakable
optical
illusion
that
of
a
pyramid
and
shining
golden
capstone.
Solomon
said
he
always
considered
the
illusion
a
silent
reminder
that
the
mysteries
of
Freemasonry
were
perfectly
visible
to
anyone
and
everyone
if
they
were
seen
from
the
proper
perspective.
Tonight,
however,
the
mysteries
of
Freemasonry
had
materialized
front
and
center.
Langdon
now
sat
opposite
the
Worshipful
Master
Peter
Solomon
and
the
Masonic
Pyramid.
Peter
was
smiling.
"The
'word'
you
refer
to,
Robert,
is
not
a
legend.
It
is
a
reality."
Langdon
stared
across
the
table
and
finally
spoke.
"But
I
don't
understand.
How
is
that
possible?"
"What
is
so
difficult
to
accept?"
All
of
it!
Langdon
wanted
to
say,
searching
his
old
friend's
eyes
for
any
hint
of
common
sense.
"You're
saying
you
believe
the
Lost
Word
is
real
and
that
it
has
actual
power?'
"Enormous
power,"
Peter
said.
"It
has
the
power
to
transform
human
kind
by
unlocking
the
Ancient
Mysteries."
"A
wordT
Langdon
challenged.
"Peter,
I
can't
possibly
believe
a
word
"You
will
believe,"
Peter
stated
calmly.
Langdon
stared
in
silence.
"As
you
know,"
Solomon
continued,
standing
now
and
pacing
around
the
table,
"it
has
long
been
prophesied
that
there
will
come
a
day
when
the
Lost
Word
will
be
rediscovered
a
day
when
it
will
be
unearthed
and
mankind
will
once
again
have
access
to
its
forgotten
power."
Langdon
flashed
on
Peter's
lecture
about
the
Apocalypse.
Although
many
people
erroneously
interpreted
apocalypse
as
a
cataclysmic
end
of
the
world,
the
word
literally
signified
an
"unveiling,"
predicted
by
the
ancients
to
be
that
of
great
wisdom.
The
coming
age
of
enlightenment.
Even
so,
Langdon
could
not
imagine
such
a
vast
change
being
ushered
in
by
a
word.
Peter
motioned
to
the
stone
pyramid,
which
sat
on
the
table
beside
its
golden
capstone.
"The
Masonic
Pyramid,"
he
said.
"The
legendary
symbolon.
Tonight
it
stands
unified
and
complete."
Reverently,
he
lifted
the
golden
capstone
and
set
it
atop
the
pyramid.
The
heavy
gold
piece
clicked
softly
into
place.
"Tonight,
my
friend,
you
have
done
what
has
never
been
done
before.
You
have
assembled
the
Masonic
Pyramid,
deciphered
all
of
its
codes,
and
in
the
end,
unveiled
this."
Solomon
produced
a
sheet
of
paper
and
laid
it
on
the
table.
Langdon
recognized
the
grid
of
symbols
that
had
been
reorganized
using
the
Order
Eight
Franklin
Square.
He
had
studied
it
briefly
in
the
Temple
Room.
Peter
said,
"I
am
curious
to
know
if
you
can
read
this
array
of
symbols.
After
all,
you
are
the
specialist."
Langdon
eyed
the
grid.
Heredom,

Langdon
sighed.
"Well,
Peter,
as
you
can
probably
see,
this
is
an
allegorical
pictogram.
Clearly
its
language
is
metaphorical
and
symbolic
rather
than
literal."
Solomon
chuckled.
"Ask
a
symbologist
a
simple
question
Okay,
tell
me
what
you
see."
Peter
really
wants
to
hear
this?
Langdon
pulled
the
page
toward
him.
"Well,
I
looked
at
it
earlier,
and,
in
simple
terms,
I
see
that
this
grid
is
a
picture
depicting
heaven
and
earth."
Peter
arched
his
eyebrows,
looking
surprised.
"Oh?"
"Sure.
At
the
top
of
the
image,
we
have
the
word
Heredom
the
'Holy
House'
which
I
interpret
as
the
House
of
God
or
heaven."
"The
downward-facing
arrow
after
Heredom
signifies
that
the
rest
of
the
pictogram
clearly
lies
in
the
realm
beneath
heaven
that
being
earth."
Langdon'
s
eyes
glided
now
to
the
bottom
of
the
grid.
"The
lowest
two
rows,
those
beneath
the
pyramid,
represent
the
earth
itself
terra
firma
the
lowest
of
all
the
realms.
Fittingly,
these
lower
realms
contain
the
twelve
ancient
astrological
signs,
which
represent
the
primordial
religion
of
those
first
human
souls
who
looked
to
the
heavens
and
saw
the
hand
of
God
in
the
movement
of
the
stars
and
planets."
Solomon
slid
his
chair
closer
and
studied
the
grid.
"Okay,
what
else?"
"On
a
foundation
of
astrology,"
Langdon
continued,
"the
great
pyramid
rises
from
the
earth
stretching
toward
heaven
the
enduring
symbol
of
lost
wisdom.
It
is
filled
with
history's
great
philosophies
and
religions
Egyptian,
Pythagorean,
Buddhist,
Hindu,
Islamic,
Judeo-Christian,
and
on
and
on
all
flowing
upward,
merging
together,
funneling
themselves
up
through
the
transformative
gateway
of
the
pyramid
where
they
finally
fuse
into
a
single,
unified
human
philosophy."
He
paused.
"A
single
universal
consciousness
a
shared
global
vision
of
God
represented
by
the
ancient
symbol
that
hovers
over
the
capstone."
Okay.
?5
"The
circumpunct,"
Peter
said.
"A
universal
symbol
for
God."
"Right.
Throughout
history,
the
circumpunct
has
been
all
things
to
all
people
it
is
the
sun
god
Ra,
alchemical
gold,
the
all-seeing
eye,
the
singularity
point
before
the
Big
Bang,
the
"The
Great
Architect
of
the
Universe."
Langdon
nodded,
sensing
this
was
probably
the
same
argument
Peter
had
used
in
the
Temple
Room
to
sell
the
idea
of
the
circumpunct
as
the
Lost
Word.
"And
finally?"
Peter
asked.
"What
about
the
staircase?"
Langdon
glanced
down
at
the
image
of
the
stairs
beneath
the
pyramid.
"Peter,
I'm
sure
you
know
as
well
as
anyone,
this
symbolizes
the
Winding
Staircase
of
Freemasonry
leading
upward
out
of
the
earthly
darkness
into
the
light
like
Jacob's
ladder
climbing
to
heaven
or
the
tiered
human
spine
that
connects
man's
mortal
body
to
his
eternal
mind."
He
paused.
"As
for
the
rest
of
the
symbols,
they
appear
to
be
a
blend
of
celestial,
Masonic,
and
scientific,
all
lending
support
to
the
Ancient
Mysteries."
Solomon
stroked
his
chin.
"An
elegant
interpretation,
Professor.
I
agree,
of
course,
that
this
grid
can
be
read
as
allegory,
and
yet"
His
eyes
flashed
with
deepening
mystery.
"This
collection
of
symbols
tells
another
story
as
well.
A
story
that
is
far
more
revealing."
"Oh?"
Solomon
began
pacing
again,
circling
the
table.
"Earlier
tonight,
inside
the
Temple
Room,
when
I
believed
I
was
going
to
die,
I
looked
at
this
grid,
and
somehow
I
saw
past
the
metaphor,
past
the
allegory,
into
the
very
heart
of
what
these
symbols
are
telling
us."
He
paused,
turning
abruptly
to
Langdon.
"This
grid
reveals
the
exact
location
where
the
Lost
Word
is
buried."
"Come
again?"
Langdon
shifted
uneasily
in
his
chair,
suddenly
fearing
that
the
trauma
of
the
evening
had
left
Peter
disorientated
and
confused.
"Robert,
legend
has
always
described
the
Masonic
Pyramid
as
a
map
a
very
specific
map
a
map
that
could
guide
the
worthy
to
the
secret
location
of
the
Lost
Word."
Solomon
tapped
the
grid
of
symbols
in
front
of
Langdon.
"I
guarantee
you,
these
symbols
are
exactly
what
legend
says
they
are
a
map.
A
specific
diagram
that
reveals
exactly
where
we
will
find
the
staircase
that
leads
down
to
the
Lost
Word."
Langdon
gave
an
uneasy
laugh,
treading
carefully
now.
"Even
if
I
believed
the
Legend
of
the
Masonic
Pyramid,
this
grid
of
symbols
can't
possibly
be
a
map.
Look
at
it.
It
looks
nothing
like
a
map."
Solomon
smiled.
"Sometimes
all
it
takes
is
a
tiny
shift
of
perspective
to
see
something
familiar
in
a
totally
new
light."
Langdon
looked
again
but
saw
nothing
new.
"Let
me
ask
you
a
question,"
Peter
said.
"When
Masons
lay
cornerstones,
do
you
know
why
we
lay
them
in
the
northeast
corner
of
a
building?"
"Sure,
because
the
northeast
corner
receives
the
first
rays
of
morning
light.
It
is
symbolic
of
the
power
of
architecture
to
climb
out
of
the
earth
into
the
light."
"Right,"
Peter
said.
"So
perhaps
you
should
look
there
for
the
first
rays
of
light."
He
motioned
to
the
grid.
"In
the
northeast
corner."
Langdon
returned
his
eyes
to
the
page,
moving
his
gaze
to
the
upper
right
or
northeast
corner.
The
symbol
in
that
corner
was
.
"A
downward-pointing
arrow,"
Langdon
said,
trying
to
grasp
Solomon's
point.
"Which
means
beneath
Heredom."
"No,
Robert,
not
beneath"
Solomon
replied.
"Think.
This
grid
is
not
a
metaphorical
maze.
It's
a
map.
And
on
a
map,
a
directional
arrow
that
points
down
means
"South,"
Langdon
exclaimed,
startled.
"Exactly!"
Solomon
replied,
grinning
now
with
excitement.
"Due
south!
On
a
map,
down
is
south.
Moreover,
on
a
map,
the
word
Heredom
would
not
be
a
metaphor
for
heaven,
it
would
be
the
name
of
a
geographic
location."
"The
House
of
the
Temple?
You're
saying
this
map
is
pointing
due
south
of
this
building?"
"Praise
God!"
Solomon
said,
laughing.
"Light
dawns
at
last."
Langdon
studied
the
grid.
"But,
Peter
even
if
you're
right,
due
south
of
this
building
could
be
anywhere
on
a
longitude
that's
over
twenty-four
thousand
miles
long."
"No,
Robert.
You
are
ignoring
the
legend,
which
claims
the
Lost
Word
is
buried
in
D.C.
That
shortens
the
line
substantially.
In
addition,
legend
also
claims
that
a
large
stone
sits
atop
the
opening
of
the
staircase
and
that
this
stone
is
engraved
with
a
message
in
an
ancient
language
as
a
kind
of
marker
so
the
worthy
can
find
it."
Langdon
was
having
trouble
taking
any
of
this
seriously,
and
while
he
didn't
know
D.C.
well
enough
to
picture
what
was
due
south
of
their
current
location,
he
was
pretty
certain
there
was
no
huge
engraved
stone
atop
a
buried
staircase.
"The
message
inscribed
on
the
stone,"
Peter
said,
"is
right
here
before
our
eyes."
He
tapped
the
third
row
of
the
grid
before
Langdon.
"This
is
the
inscription,
Robert!
You've
solved
the
puzzle!"
Dumbfounded,
Langdon
studied
the
seven
symbols.
[L)
Am
21
Solved?
Langdon
had
no
idea
whatsoever
what
these
seven
disparate
symbols
could
possibly
mean,
and
he
was
damned
sure
they
were
not
engraved
anywhere
in
the
nation's
capital
particularly
on
a
giant
stone
over
a
staircase.
"Peter,"
he
said,
"I
don't
see
how
this
sheds
any
light
at
all.
I
know
of
no
stone
in
D.C.
engraved
with
this
message."
Solomon
patted
him
on
the
shoulder.
"You
have
walked
past
it
and
never
seen
it.
We
all
have.
It
is
sitting
in
plain
view,
like
the
mysteries
themselves.
And
tonight,
when
I
saw
these
seven
symbols,
I
realized
in
an
instant
that
the
legend
was
true.
The
Lost
Word
is
buried
in
D.C.
and
it
does
rest
at
the
bottom
of
a
long
staircase
beneath
an
enormous
engraved
stone."
Mystified,
Langdon
remained
silent.
"Robert,
tonight
I
believe
you
have
earned
the
right
to
know
the
truth."
Langdon
stared
at
Peter,
trying
to
process
what
he
had
just
heard.
"You're
going
to
tell
me
where
the
Lost
Word
is
buried?"
"No,"
Solomon
said,
standing
up
with
a
smile.
"I'm
going
to
show
you."
Five
minutes
later,
Langdon
was
buckling
himself
into
the
backseat
of
the
Escalade
beside
Peter
Solomon.
Simkins
climbed
in
behind
the
wheel
as
Sato
approached
across
the
parking
lot.
"Mr.
Solomon?"
the
director
said,
lighting
a
cigarette
as
she
arrived.
"I've
just
made
the
call
you
requested."
"And?"
Peter
asked
through
his
open
window.
"I
ordered
them
to
give
you
access.
Briefly."
"Thank
you."
Sato
studied
him,
looking
curious.
"I
must
say,
it's
a
most
unusual
request."
Solomon
gave
an
enigmatic
shrug.
Sato
let
it
go,
circling
around
to
Langdon'
s
window
and
rapping
with
her
knuckles.
Langdon
lowered
the
window.
"Professor,"
she
said,
with
no
hint
of
warmth.
"Your
assistance
tonight,
while
reluctant,
was
critical
to
our
success
and
for
that,
I
thank
you."
She
took
a
long
drag
on
her
cigarette
and
blew
it
sideways.
"However,
one
final
bit
of
advice.
The
next
time
a
senior
administrator
of
the
CIA
tells
you
she
has
a
national-
security
crisis"
Her
eyes
flashed
black.
"Leave
the
bullshit
in
Cambridge."
Langdon
opened
his
mouth
to
speak,
but
Director
Inoue
Sato
had
already
turned
and
was
headed
off
across
the
parking
lot
toward
a
waiting
helicopter.
Simkins
glanced
over
his
shoulder,
stone-faced.
"Are
you
gentlemen
ready?"
"Actually,"
Solomon
said,
"just
one
moment."
He
produced
a
small,
folded
piece
of
dark
fabric
and
handed
it
to
Langdon.
"Robert,
I'd
like
you
to
put
this
on
before
we
go
anywhere."
Puzzled,
Langdon
examined
the
cloth.
It
was
black
velvet.
As
he
unfolded
it,
he
realized
he
was
holding
a
Masonic
hoodwink
the
traditional
blindfold
of
a
first-degree
initiate.
What
the
hell?
Peter
said,
"I'd
prefer
you
not
see
where
we're
going."
Langdon
turned
to
Peter.
"You
want
to
blindfold
me
for
the
journey?"
Solomon
grinned.
"My
secret.
My
rules."
The
breeze
felt
cold
outside
CIA
headquarters
in
Langley.
Nola
Kaye
was
shivering
as
she
followed
sys-sec
Rick
Parrish
across
the
agency's
moonlit
central
courtyard.
Where
is
Rick
taking
me?
The
crisis
of
the
Masonic
video
had
been
averted,
thank
God,
but
Nola
still
felt
uneasy.
The
redacted
file
on
the
CIA
director's
partition
remained
a
mystery,
and
it
was
nagging
at
her.
She
and
Sato
would
debrief
in
the
morning,
and
Nola
wanted
all
the
facts.
Finally,
she
had
called
Rick
Parrish
and
demanded
his
help.
Now,
as
she
followed
Rick
to
some
unknown
location
outside,
Nola
could
not
push
the
bizarre
phrases
from
her
memory:
Secret
location
underground
where
the
somewhere
in
Washington,
D.C.,
the
coordinates
uncovered
an
ancient
portal
that
led
warning
the
pyramid
holds
dangerous
decipher
this
engraved
symbolon
to
unveil
"You
and
I
agree,"
Parrish
said
as
they
walked,
"that
the
hacker
who
spidered
those
keywords
was
definitely
searching
for
information
about
the
Masonic
Pyramid."
Obviously,
Nola
thought.
"It
turns
out,
though,
the
hacker
stumbled
onto
a
facet
of
the
Masonic
mystery
I
don't
think
he
expected."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"Nola,
you
know
how
the
CIA
director
sponsors
an
internal
discussion
forum
for
Agency
employees
to
share
their
ideas
about
all
kinds
of
things?"
"Of
course."
The
forums
provided
Agency
personnel
a
safe
place
to
chat
online
about
various
topics
and
gave
the
director
a
kind
of
virtual
gateway
to
his
staff.
"The
director's
forums
are
hosted
on
his
private
partition,
and
yet
in
order
to
provide
access
to
employees
of
all
clearance
levels,
they're
located
outside
the
director's
classified
firewall."
"What
are
you
getting
at?"
she
demanded
as
they
rounded
a
corner
near
the
Agency
cafeteria.
"In
a
word"
Parrish
pointed
into
the
darkness.
"That.
Nola
glanced
up.
Across
the
plaza
in
front
of
them
was
a
massive
metal
sculpture
glimmering
in
the
moonlight.
In
an
agency
that
boasted
over
five
hundred
pieces
of
original
art,
this
sculpture
titled
Kryptos
was
by
far
the
most
famous.
Greek
for
"hidden,"
Kryptos
was
the
work
of
American
artist
James
Sanborn
and
had
become
something
of
a
legend
here
at
the
CIA.
The
work
consisted
of
a
massive
S-shaped
panel
of
copper,
set
on
its
edge
like
a
curling
metal
wall.
Engraved
into
the
expansive
surface
of
the
wall
were
nearly
two
thousand
letters
organized
into
a
baffling
code.
As
if
this
were
not
enigmatic
enough,
positioned
carefully
in
the
area
around
the
encrypted
S-wall
were
numerous
other
sculptural
elements
granite
slabs
at
odd
angles,
a
compass
rose,
a
magnetic
lodestone,
and
even
a
message
in
Morse
code
that
referenced
"lucid
memory"
and
"shadow
forces."
Most
fans
believed
that
these
pieces
were
clues
that
would
reveal
how
to
decipher
the
sculpture.
Kryptos
was
art
but
it
was
also
an
enigma.
Attempting
to
decipher
its
encoded
secret
had
become
an
obsession
for
cryptologists
both
inside
and
outside
the
CIA.
Finally,
a
few
years
back,
a
portion
of
the
code
had
been
broken,
and
it
became
national
news.
Although
much
of
Kryptos'
s
code
remained
unsolved
to
this
day,
the
sections
that
had
been
deciphered
were
so
bizarre
that
they
made
the
sculpture
only
more
mysterious.
It
referenced
secret
underground
locations,
portals
that
led
into
ancient
tombs,
longitudes
and
latitudes
Nola
could
still
recall
bits
and
pieces
of
the
deciphered
sections:
The
information
was
gathered
and
transmitted
underground
to
an
unknown
location
It
was
totally
invisible
hows
that
possible
they
used
the
earths
magnetic
field
Nola
had
never
paid
much
attention
to
the
sculpture
or
cared
if
it
was
ever
fully
deciphered.
At
the
moment,
however,
she
wanted
answers.
"Why
are
you
showing
me
KryptosT
Parrish
gave
her
a
conspiratorial
smile
and
dramatically
extracted
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
from
his
pocket.
"Voila,
the
mysterious
redacted
document
you
were
so
concerned
about.
I
accessed
the
complete
text."
Nola
jumped.
"You
snooped
the
director's
classified
partition?"
"No.
That's
what
I
was
getting
at
earlier.
Have
a
look."
He
handed
her
the
file.
Nola
seized
the
page
and
unfolded
it.
When
she
saw
the
standard
Agency
headers
at
the
top
of
the
page,
she
cocked
her
head
in
surprise.
This
document
was
not
classified.
Not
even
close.
EMPLOYEE
DISCUSSION
BOARD:
KRYPTOS
COMPRESSED
STORAGE:
THREAD
#2456282.5
Nola
found
herself
looking
at
a
series
of
postings
that
had
been
compressed
into
a
single
page
for
more
efficient
storage.
"Your
keyword
document,"
Rick
said,
"is
some
cipher-punks
rambling
about
KryptosT
Nola
scanned
down
the
document
until
she
spotted
a
sentence
containing
a
familiar
set
of
keywords.
Jim,
the
sculpture
says
it
was
transmitted
to
a
secret
location
UNDERGROUND
where
the
info
was
hidden.
"This
text
is
from
the
director's
online
Kryptos
forum,"
Rick
explained.
"The
forum's
been
going
for
years.
There
are
literally
thousands
of
postings.
I'm
not
surprised
one
of
them
happened
to
contain
all
the
keywords."
Nola
kept
scanning
down
until
she
spotted
another
posting
containing
keywords.
Even
though
Mark
said
the
code's
lat/long
headings
point
somewhere
in
WASHINGTON,
D.C.,
the
coordinates
he
used
were
off
by
one
degree
Kryptos
basically
points
back
to
itself.
Parrish
walked
over
to
the
statue
and
ran
his
palm
across
the
cryptic
sea
of
letters.
"A
lot
of
this
code
has
yet
to
be
deciphered,
and
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
think
the
message
might
actually
relate
to
ancient
Masonic
secrets."
Nola
now
recalled
murmurs
of
a
Masonic/Crypto*
link,
but
she
tended
to
ignore
the
lunatic
fringe.
Then
again,
looking
around
at
the
various
pieces
of
the
sculpture
arranged
around
the
plaza,
she
realized
that
it
was
a
code
in
pieces
a
symbolon
just
like
the
Masonic
Pyramid.
Odd.
For
a
moment,
Nola
could
almost
see
Kryptos
as
a
modern
Masonic
Pyramid
a
code
in
many
pieces,
made
of
different
materials,
each
playing
a
role.
"Do
you
think
there's
any
way
Kryptos
and
the
Masonic
Pyramid
might
be
hiding
the
same
secret?"
"Who
knows?"
Parrish
shot
Kryptos
a
frustrated
look.
"I
doubt
we'll
ever
know
the
whole
message.
That
is,
unless
someone
can
convince
the
director
to
unlock
his
safe
and
sneak
a
peek
at
the
solution."
Nola
nodded.
It
was
all
coming
back
to
her
now.
When
Kryptos
was
installed,
it
arrived
with
a
sealed
envelope
containing
a
complete
decryption
of
the
sculpture's
codes.
The
sealed
solution
was
entrusted
to
then-CIA
director
William
Webster,
who
locked
it
in
his
office
safe.
The
document
was
allegedly
still
there,
having
been
transferred
from
director
to
director
over
the
years.
Strangely,
Nola's
thoughts
of
William
Webster
sparked
her
memory,
bringing
back
yet
another
portion
of
Kryptos'
s
deciphered
text:
IT'S
BURIED
OUT
THERE
SOMEWHERE.
WHO
KNOWS
THE
EXACT
LOCATION?
ONLY
WW.
Although
nobody
knew
exactly
what
was
buried
out
there,
most
people
believed
the
WW
was
a
reference
to
William
Webster.
Nola
had
heard
whispers
once
that
it
referred
in
fact
to
a
man
named
William
Whiston
a
Royal
Society
theologian
although
she
had
never
bothered
to
give
it
much
thought.
Rick
was
talking
again.
"I've
got
to
admit,
I'm
not
really
into
artists,
but
I
think
this
guy
Sanborn's
a
serious
genius.
I
was
just
looking
online
at
his
Cyrillic
Projector
project?
It
shines
giant
Russian
letters
from
a
KGB
document
on
mind
control.
Freaky."
Nola
was
no
longer
listening.
She
was
examining
the
paper,
where
she
had
found
the
third
key
phrase
in
another
posting.
Right,
that
whole
section
is
verbatim
from
some
famous
archaeologist's
diary,
telling
about
the
moment
he
dug
down
and
uncovered
an
ANCIENT
PORTAL
that
led
to
the
tomb
of
Tutankhamen.
The
archaeologist
who
was
quoted
on
Kryptos,
Nola
knew,
was
in
fact
famed
Egyptologist
Howard
Carter.
The
next
posting
referenced
him
by
name.
I
just
skimmed
the
rest
of
Carter's
field
notes
online,
and
it
sounds
like
he
found
a
clay
tablet
warning
the
PYRAMID
holds
dangerous
consequences
for
anyone
who
disturbs
the
peace
of
the
pharaoh.
A
curse!
Should
we
be
worried?
:)
Nola
scowled.
"Rick,
for
God's
sake,
this
idiot's
pyramid
reference
isn't
even
right.
Tutankhamen
wasn't
buried
in
a
pyramid.
He
was
buried
in
the
Valley
of
the
Kings.
Don't
cryptologists
watch
the
Discovery
Channel?"
Parrish
shrugged.
"Techies."
Nola
now
saw
the
final
key
phrase.
Guys,
you
know
I'm
not
a
conspiracy
theorist,
but
Jim
and
Dave
had
better
decipher
this
ENGRAVED
SYMBOLON
to
unveil
its
final
secret
before
the
world
ends
in
2012
Ciao.
"Anyhow,"
Parrish
said,
"I
figured
you'd
want
to
know
about
the
Kryptos
forum
before
you
accused
the
CIA
director
of
harboring
classified
documentation
about
an
ancient
Masonic
legend.
Somehow,
I
doubt
a
man
as
powerful
as
the
CIA
director
has
time
for
that
sort
of
thing."
Nola
pictured
the
Masonic
video
and
its
images
of
all
the
influential
men
participating
in
an
ancient
rite.
If
Rick
had
any
idea
In
the
end,
she
knew,
whatever
Kryptos
ultimately
revealed,
the
message
definitely
had
mystical
undertones.
She
gazed
up
at
the
gleaming
piece
of
art
a
three-dimensional
code
standing
silently
at
the
heart
of
one
of
the
nation's
premier
intelligence
agencies
and
she
wondered
if
it
would
ever
give
up
its
final
secret.
As
she
and
Rick
headed
back
inside,
Nola
had
to
smile.
It's
buried
out
there
somewhere.
This
is
crazy.
Blindfolded,
Robert
Langdon
could
see
nothing
as
the
Escalade
sped
southward
along
the
deserted
streets.
On
the
seat
beside
him,
Peter
Solomon
remained
silent.
Where
is
he
taking
me?
Langdon'
s
curiosity
was
a
mix
of
intrigue
and
apprehension,
his
imagination
in
overdrive
as
it
tried
desperately
to
put
the
pieces
together.
Peter
had
not
wavered
from
his
claim.
The
Lost
Word?
Buried
at
the
bottom
of
a
staircase
that's
covered
by
a
massive,
engraved
stone?
It
all
seemed
impossible.
The
stone's
alleged
engraving
was
still
lodged
in
Langdon'
s
memory
and
yet
the
seven
symbols,
as
far
as
he
could
tell,
made
no
sense
together
at
all.
The
Stonemason'
s
Square:
the
symbol
of
honesty
and
being
"true.
The
letters
Au:
the
scientific
abbreviation
for
the
element
gold.
The
Sigma:
the
Greek
letter
S,
the
mathematical
symbol
for
the
sum
of
all
parts.
The
Pyramid:
the
Egyptian
symbol
of
man
reaching
heavenward.
The
Delta:
the
Greek
letter
D,
the
mathematical
symbol
for
change.
Mercury:
as
depicted
by
its
most
ancient
alchemical
symbol.
The
Ouroboros:
the
symbol
of
wholeness
and
at-one-ment.
Solomon
still
insisted
these
seven
symbols
were
a
"message."
But
if
this
was
true,
then
it
was
a
message
Langdon
had
no
idea
how
to
read.
The
Escalade
slowed
suddenly
and
turned
sharply
right,
onto
a
different
surface,
as
if
into
a
driveway
or
access
road.
Langdon
perked
up,
listening
intently
for
clues
as
to
their
whereabouts.
They'd
been
driving
for
less
than
ten
minutes,
and
although
Langdon
had
tried
to
follow
in
his
mind,
he
had
lost
his
bearings
quickly.
For
all
he
knew,
they
were
now
pulling
back
into
the
House
of
the
Temple.
The
Escalade
came
to
a
stop,
and
Langdon
heard
the
window
roll
down.
"Agent
Simkins,
CIA,"
their
driver
announced.
"I
believe
you're
expecting
us."
"Yes,
sir,"
a
sharp
military
voice
replied.
"Director
Sato
phoned
ahead.
One
moment
while
I
move
the
security
barricade."
Langdon
listened
with
rising
confusion,
now
sensing
they
were
entering
a
military
base.
As
the
car
began
moving
again,
along
an
unusually
smooth
stretch
of
pavement,
he
turned
his
head
blindly
toward
Solomon.
"Where
are
we,
Peter?"
he
demanded.
"Do
no?
remove
your
blindfold."
Peter's
voice
was
stern.
The
vehicle
continued
a
short
distance
and
again
slowed
to
a
stop.
Simkins
killed
the
engine.
More
voices.
Military.
Someone
asked
for
Simkins's
identification.
The
agent
got
out
and
spoke
to
the
men
in
hushed
tones.
Langdon'
s
door
was
suddenly
being
opened,
and
powerful
hands
assisted
him
out
of
the
car.
The
air
felt
cold.
It
was
windy.
Solomon
was
beside
him.
"Robert,
just
let
Agent
Simkins
lead
you
inside."
Langdon
heard
metal
keys
in
a
lock
and
then
the
creak
of
a
heavy
iron
door
swinging
open.
It
sounded
like
an
ancient
bulkhead.
Where
the
hell
are
they
taking
me?!
Simkins's
hands
guided
Langdon
in
the
direction
of
the
metal
door.
They
stepped
over
a
threshold.
"Straight
ahead,
Professor."
It
was
suddenly
quiet.
Dead.
Deserted.
The
air
inside
smelled
sterile
and
processed.
Simkins
and
Solomon
flanked
Langdon
now,
guiding
him
blindly
down
a
reverberating
corridor.
The
floor
felt
like
stone
beneath
his
loafers.
Behind
them,
the
metal
door
slammed
loudly,
and
Langdon
jumped.
The
locks
turned.
He
was
sweating
now
beneath
his
blindfold.
He
wanted
only
to
tear
it
off.
They
stopped
walking
now.
Simkins
let
go
of
Langdon'
s
arm,
and
there
was
a
series
of
electronic
beeps
followed
by
an
unexpected
rumble
in
front
of
them,
which
Langdon
imagined
had
to
be
a
security
door
sliding
open
automatically.
"Mr.
Solomon,
you
and
Mr.
Langdon
continue
on
alone.
I'll
wait
for
you
here,"
Simkins
said.
"Take
my
flashlight."
"Thank
you,"
Solomon
said.
"We
won't
be
long."
Flashlight?!
Langdon's
heart
was
pounding
wildly
now.
Peter
took
Langdon's
arm
in
his
own
and
inched
forward.
"Walk
with
me,
Robert."
They
moved
slowly
together
across
another
threshold,
and
the
security
door
rumbled
shut
behind
them.
Peter
stopped
short.
"Is
something
wrong?"
Langdon
was
suddenly
feeling
queasy
and
off
balance.
"I
think
I
just
need
to
take
off
this
blindfold."
"Not
yet,
we're
almost
there."
"Almost
whereT
Langdon
felt
a
growing
heaviness
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach.
"I
told
you
I'm
taking
you
to
see
the
staircase
that
descends
to
the
Lost
Word."
"Peter,
this
isn't
funny!"
"It's
not
meant
to
be.
It's
meant
to
open
your
mind,
Robert.
It's
meant
to
remind
you
that
there
are
mysteries
in
this
world
that
even
you
have
yet
to
lay
eyes
upon.
And
before
I
take
one
more
step
with
you,
I
want
you
to
do
something
for
me.
I
want
you
to
believe
just
for
an
instant
believe
in
the
legend.
Believe
that
you
are
about
to
peer
down
a
winding
staircase
that
plunges
hundreds
of
feet
to
one
of
humankind's
greatest
lost
treasures."
Langdon
felt
dizzy.
As
much
as
he
wanted
to
believe
his
dear
friend,
he
could
not.
"Is
it
much
farther?"
His
velvet
hoodwink
was
drenched
in
sweat.
"No.
Only
a
few
more
steps,
actually.
Through
one
last
door.
I'll
open
it
now."
Solomon
let
go
of
him
for
a
moment,
and
as
he
did
so,
Langdon
swayed,
feeling
light-headed.
Unsteady,
he
reached
out
for
stability,
and
Peter
was
quickly
back
at
his
side.
The
sound
of
a
heavy
automatic
door
rumbled
in
front
of
them.
Peter
took
Langdon'
s
arm
and
they
moved
forward
again.
"This
way."
They
inched
across
another
threshold,
and
the
door
slid
closed
behind
them.
Silence.
Cold.
Langdon
immediately
sensed
that
this
place,
whatever
it
was,
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
world
on
the
other
side
of
the
security
doors.
The
air
was
dank
and
chilly,
like
a
tomb.
The
acoustics
felt
dull
and
cramped.
He
felt
an
irrational
bout
of
claustrophobia
settling
in.
"A
few
more
steps."
Solomon
guided
him
blindly
around
a
corner
and
positioned
him
precisely.
Finally,
he
said,
"Take
off
your
blindfold."
Langdon
seized
the
velvet
hoodwink
and
tore
it
from
his
face.
He
looked
all
around
to
find
out
where
he
was,
but
he
was
still
blind.
He
rubbed
his
eyes.
Nothing.
"Peter,
it's
pitch-black!"
"Yes,
I
know.
Reach
in
front
of
you.
There's
a
railing.
Grasp
it."
Langdon
groped
in
the
darkness
and
found
an
iron
railing.
"Now
watch."
He
could
hear
Peter
fumbling
with
something,
and
suddenly
a
blazing
flashlight
beam
pierced
the
darkness.
It
was
pointed
at
the
floor,
and
before
Langdon
could
take
in
his
surroundings,
Solomon
directed
the
flashlight
out
over
the
railing
and
pointed
the
beam
straight
down.
Langdon
was
suddenly
staring
into
a
bottomless
shaft
an
endless
winding
staircase
that
plunged
deep
into
the
earth.
My
God!
His
knees
nearly
buckled,
and
he
gripped
the
railing
for
support.
The
staircase
was
a
traditional
square
spiral,
and
he
could
see
at
least
thirty
landings
descending
into
the
earth
before
the
flashlight
faded
to
nothing.
/
can
't
even
see
the
bottom!
"Peter"
he
stammered.
"What
is
this
place!"
"I'll
take
you
to
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
in
a
moment,
but
before
I
do,
you
need
to
see
something
else."
Too
overwhelmed
to
protest,
Langdon
let
Peter
guide
him
away
from
the
stairwell
and
across
the
strange
little
chamber.
Peter
kept
the
flashlight
trained
on
the
worn
stone
floor
beneath
their
feet,
and
Langdon
could
get
no
real
sense
of
the
space
around
them
except
that
it
was
small.
A
tiny
stone
chamber.
They
arrived
quickly
at
the
room's
opposite
wall,
in
which
was
embedded
a
rectangle
of
glass.
Langdon
thought
it
might
be
a
window
into
a
room
beyond,
and
yet
from
where
he
stood,
he
saw
only
darkness
on
the
other
side.
"Go
ahead,"
Peter
said.
"Have
a
look."
"What's
in
there?"
Langdon
flashed
for
an
instant
on
the
Chamber
of
Reflection
beneath
the
Capitol
Building,
and
how
he
had
believed,
for
a
moment,
that
it
might
contain
a
portal
to
some
giant
underground
cavern.
"Just
look,
Robert."
Solomon
inched
him
forward.
"And
brace
yourself,
because
the
sight
will
shock
you."
Having
no
idea
what
to
expect,
Langdon
moved
toward
the
glass.
As
he
neared
the
portal,
Peter
turned
out
the
flashlight,
plunging
the
tiny
chamber
into
total
darkness.
As
his
eyes
adjusted,
Langdon
groped
in
front
of
him,
his
hands
finding
the
wall,
finding
the
glass,
his
face
moving
closer
to
the
transparent
portal.
Still
only
darkness
beyond.
He
leaned
closer
pressing
his
face
to
the
glass.
Then
he
saw
it.
The
wave
of
shock
and
disorientation
that
tore
through
Langdon'
s
body
reached
down
inside
and
spun
his
internal
compass
upside
down.
He
nearly
fell
backward
as
his
mind
strained
to
accept
the
utterly
unanticipated
sight
that
was
before
him.
In
his
wildest
dreams,
Robert
Langdon
would
never
have
guessed
what
lay
on
the
other
side
of
this
glass.
The
vision
was
a
glorious
sight.
There
in
the
darkness,
a
brilliant
white
light
shone
like
a
gleaming
jewel.
Langdon
now
understood
it
all
the
barricade
on
the
access
road
the
guards
at
the
main
entrance
the
heavy
metal
door
outside
the
automatic
doors
that
rumbled
open
and
closed
the
heaviness
in
his
stomach
the
lightness
in
his
head
and
now
this
tiny
stone
chamber.
"Robert,"
Peter
whispered
behind
him,
"sometimes
a
change
of
perspective
is
all
it
takes
to
see
the
light."
Speechless,
Langdon
stared
out
through
the
window.
His
gaze
traveled
into
the
darkness
of
the
night,
traversing
more
than
a
mile
of
empty
space,
dropping
lower
lower
through
the
darkness
until
it
came
to
rest
atop
the
brilliantly
illuminated,
stark
white
dome
of
the
U.S.
Capitol
Building.
Langdon
had
never
seen
the
Capitol
from
this
perspective
hovering
555
feet
in
the
air
atop
America's
great
Egyptian
obelisk.
Tonight,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life,
he
had
ridden
the
elevator
up
to
the
tiny
viewing
chamber
at
the
pinnacle
of
the
Washington
Monument.
Robert
Langdon
stood
mesmerized
at
the
glass
portal,
absorbing
the
power
of
the
landscape
below
him.
Having
ascended
unknowingly
hundreds
of
feet
into
the
air,
he
was
now
admiring
one
of
the
most
spectacular
vistas
he
had
ever
seen.
The
shining
dome
of
the
U.S.
Capitol
rose
like
a
mountain
at
the
east
end
of
the
National
Mall.
On
either
side
of
the
building,
two
parallel
lines
of
light
stretched
toward
him
the
illuminated
facades
of
the
Smithsonian
museums
beacons
of
art,
history,
science,
culture.
Langdon
now
realized
to
his
astonishment
that
much
of
what
Peter
had
declared
to
be
true
was
in
fact
true.
There
is
indeed
a
winding
staircase
descending
hundreds
of
feet
beneath
a
massive
stone.
The
huge
capstone
of
this
obelisk
sat
directly
over
his
head,
and
Langdon
now
recalled
a
forgotten
bit
of
trivia
that
seemed
to
have
eerie
relevance:
the
capstone
of
the
Washington
Monument
weighed
precisely
thirty-three
hundred
pounds.
Again,
the
number
33.
More
startling,
however,
was
the
knowledge
that
this
capstone's
ultimate
peak,
the
zenith
of
this
obelisk,
was
crowned
by
a
tiny,
polished
tip
of
aluminum
a
metal
as
precious
as
gold
in
its
day.
The
shining
apex
of
the
Washington
Monument
was
only
about
a
foot
tall,
the
same
size
as
the
Masonic
Pyramid.
Incredibly,
this
small
metal
pyramid
bore
a
famous
engraving
Laus
Deo
and
Langdon
suddenly
understood.
This
is
the
true
message
of
the
base
of
the
stone
pyramid.
[Lj

whispered.
The
well-known
Latin
phrase
meaning
"praise
God"
was
inscribed
on
the
tip
of
the
Washington
Monument
in
script
letters
only
one
inch
tall.
On
full
display
and
yet
invisible
to
all.
Laus

"Praise
God,"
Peter
said
behind
him,
flipping
on
the
soft
lighting
in
the
chamber.
"The
Masonic
Pyramid's
final
code."
Langdon
turned.
His
friend
was
grinning
broadly,
and
Langdon
recalled
that
Peter
had
actually
spoken
the
words
"praise
God"
earlier
inside
the
Masonic
library.
And
I
still
missed
it.
Langdon
felt
a
chill
to
realize
how
apt
it
was
that
the
legendary
Masonic
Pyramid
had
guided
him
here
to
America's
great
obelisk
the
symbol
of
ancient
mystical
wisdom
rising
toward
the
heavens
at
the
heart
of
a
nation.
In
a
state
of
wonder,
Langdon
began
moving
counterclockwise
around
the
perimeter
of
the
tiny
square
room,
arriving
now
at
another
viewing
window.
North.
Through
this
northward-facing
window,
Langdon
gazed
down
at
the
familiar
silhouette
of
the
White
House
directly
in
front
of
him.
He
raised
his
eyes
to
the
horizon,
where
the
straight
line
of
Sixteenth
Street
ran
due
north
toward
the
House
of
the
Temple.
/
am
due
south
of
Heredom.
He
continued
around
the
perimeter
to
the
next
window.
Looking
west,
Langdon'
s
eyes
traced
the
long
rectangle
of
the
reflecting
pool
to
the
Lincoln
Memorial,
its
classical
Greek
architecture
inspired
by
the
Parthenon
in
Athens,
Temple
to
Athena
goddess
of
heroic
undertakings.
Annuit
coeptis,
Langdon
thought.
God
favors
our
undertaking.
Continuing
to
the
final
window,
Langdon
gazed
southward
across
the
dark
waters
of
the
Tidal
Basin,
where
the
Jefferson
Memorial
shone
brightly
in
the
night.
The
gently
sloping
cupola,
Langdon
knew,
was
modeled
after
the
Pantheon,
the
original
home
to
the
great
Roman
gods
of
mythology.
Having
looked
in
all
four
directions,
Langdon
now
thought
about
the
aerial
photos
he
had
seen
of
the
National
Mall
her
four
arms
outstretched
from
the
Washington
Monument
toward
the
cardinal
points
of
the
compass.
/
am
standing
at
the
crossroads
of
America.
Langdon
continued
back
around
to
where
Peter
was
standing.
His
mentor
was
beaming.
"Well,
Robert,
this
is
it.
The
Lost
Word.
This
is
where
it's
buried.
The
Masonic
Pyramid
led
us
here."
Langdon
did
a
double
take.
He
had
all
but
forgotten
about
the
Lost
Word.
"Robert,
I
know
of
nobody
more
trustworthy
than
you.
And
after
a
night
like
tonight,
I
believe
you
deserve
to
know
what
this
is
all
about.
As
promised
in
legend,
the
Lost
Word
is
indeed
buried
at
the
bottom
of
a
winding
staircase."
He
motioned
to
the
mouth
of
the
monument's
long
stairwell.
Langdon
had
finally
started
to
get
his
feet
back
under
him,
but
now
he
was
puzzled.
Peter
quickly
reached
into
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
small
object.
"Do
you
remember
this?"
Langdon
took
the
cube-shaped
box
that
Peter
had
entrusted
to
him
long
ago.
"Yes
but
I'm
afraid
I
didn't
do
a
very
good
job
of
protecting
it."
Solomon
chuckled.
"Perhaps
the
time
had
come
for
it
to
see
the
light
of
day."
Langdon
eyed
the
stone
cube,
wondering
why
Peter
had
just
handed
it
to
him.
"What
does
this
look
like
to
you?"
Peter
asked.
Langdon
eyed
the
1514
and
recalled
his
first
impression
when
Katherine
had
unwrapped
the
package.
"A
cornerstone."
"Exactly,"
Peter
replied.
"Now,
there
are
a
few
things
you
might
not
know
about
cornerstones.
First,
the
concept
of
laying
a
cornerstone
comes
from
the
Old
Testament."
Langdon
nodded.
"The
Book
of
Psalms."
"Correct.
And
a
true
cornerstone
is
always
buried
beneath
the
ground
symbolizing
the
building's
initial
step
upward
out
of
the
earth
toward
the
heavenly
light."
Langdon
glanced
out
at
the
Capitol,
recalling
that
its
cornerstone
was
buried
so
deep
in
the
foundation
that,
to
this
day,
excavations
had
been
unable
to
find
it.
"And
finally,"
Solomon
said,
"like
the
stone
box
in
your
hand,
many
cornerstones
are
little
vaults
and
have
hollow
cavities
so
that
they
can
hold
buried
treasures
talismans,
if
you
will
symbols
of
hope
for
the
future
of
the
building
about
to
be
erected."
Langdon
was
well
aware
of
this
tradition,
too.
Even
today,
Masons
laid
cornerstones
in
which
they
sealed
meaningful
objects
time
capsules,
photos,
proclamations,
even
the
ashes
of
important
people.
"My
purpose
in
telling
you
this,"
Solomon
said,
glancing
over
at
the
stairwell,
"should
be
clear."
"You
think
the
Lost
Word
is
buried
in
the
cornerstone
of
the
Washington
Monument?"
"I
don't
think,
Robert.
I
know.
The
Lost
Word
was
buried
in
the
cornerstone
of
this
monument
on
July
4,
1848,
in
a
full
Masonic
ritual."
Langdon
stared
at
him.
"Our
Masonic
forefathers
buried
a
wordV."
Peter
nodded.
"They
did
indeed.
They
understood
the
true
power
of
what
they
were
burying."
All
night,
Langdon
had
been
trying
to
wrap
his
mind
around
sprawling,
ethereal
concepts
the
Ancient
Mysteries,
the
Lost
Word,
the
Secrets
of
the
Ages.
He
wanted
something
solid,
and
despite
Peter's
claims
that
the
key
to
it
all
was
buried
in
a
cornerstone
555
feet
beneath
him,
Langdon
was
having
a
hard
time
accepting
it.
People
study
the
mysteries
for
entire
lifetimes
and
are
still
unable
to
access
the
power
allegedly
hidden
there.
Langdon
flashed
on
Diirer's
Melencolia
I
the
image
of
the
dejected
Adept,
surrounded
by
the
tools
of
his
failed
efforts
to
unveil
the
mystical
secrets
of
alchemy.
If
the
secrets
can
actually
be
unlocked,
they
will
not
be
found
in
one
place!
Any
answer,
Langdon
had
always
believed,
was
spread
across
the
world
in
thousands
of
volumes
encoded
into
writings
of
Pythagoras,
Hermes,
Heraclitus,
Paracelsus,
and
hundreds
of
others.
The
answer
was
found
in
dusty,
forgotten
tomes
on
alchemy,
mysticism,
magic,
and
philosophy.
The
answer
was
hidden
in
the
ancient
library
of
Alexandria,
the
clay
tablets
of
Sumer,
and
the
hieroglyphs
of
Egypt.
"Peter,
I'm
sorry,"
Langdon
said
quietly,
shaking
his
head.
"To
understand
the
Ancient
Mysteries
is
a
lifelong
process.
I
can't
imagine
how
the
key
could
possibly
rest
within
a
single
word."
Peter
placed
a
hand
on
Langdon'
s
shoulder.
"Robert,
the
Lost
Word
is
not
a
'word.'"
He
gave
a
sage
smile.
"We
only
call
it
the
'Word'
because
that's
what
the
ancients
called
it
in
the
beginning."
In
the
beginning
was
the
Word.
Dean
Galloway
knelt
at
the
Great
Crossing
of
the
National
Cathedral
and
prayed
for
America.
He
prayed
that
his
beloved
country
would
soon
come
to
grasp
the
true
power
of
the
Word
the
recorded
collection
of
the
written
wisdom
of
all
the
ancient
masters
the
spiritual
truths
taught
by
the
great
sages.
History
had
blessed
mankind
with
the
wisest
of
teachers,
profoundly
enlightened
souls
whose
understanding
of
the
spiritual
and
mental
mysteries
exceeded
all
understanding.
The
precious
words
of
these
Adepts
Buddha,
Jesus,
Muhammad,
Zoroaster,
and
countless
others
had
been
transmitted
through
history
in
the
oldest
and
most
precious
of
vessels.
Books.
Every
culture
on
earth
had
its
own
sacred
book
its
own
Word
each
one
different
and
yet
each
one
the
same.
For
Christians,
the
Word
was
the
Bible,
for
Muslims
the
Koran,
for
Jews
the
Torah,
for
Hindus
the
Vedas,
and
on
and
on
it
went.
The
Word
shall
light
the
way.
For
America's
Masonic
forefathers,
the
Word
had
been
the
Bible.
And
yet
few
people
in
history
have
understood
its
true
message.
Tonight,
as
Galloway
knelt
alone
within
the
great
cathedral,
he
placed
his
hands
upon
the
Word
a
well-
worn
copy
of
his
own
Masonic
Bible.
This
treasured
book,
like
all
Masonic
Bibles,
contained
the
Old
Testament,
the
New
Testament,
and
a
treasure
trove
of
Masonic
philosophical
writings.
Although
Galloway's
eyes
could
no
longer
read
the
text,
he
knew
the
preface
by
heart.
Its
glorious
message
had
been
read
by
millions
of
his
brethren
in
countless
languages
around
the
world.
The
text
read:
TIME
IS
A
RIVER
AND
BOOKS
ARE
BOATS.
MANY
VOLUMES
START
DOWN
THAT
STREAM,
ONLY
TO
BE
WRECKED
AND
LOST
BEYOND
RECALL
IN
ITS
SANDS.
ONLY
A
FEW,
A
VERY
FEW,
ENDURE
THE
TESTINGS
OF
TIME
AND
LIVE
TO
BLESS
THE
AGES
FOLLOWING.
There
is
a
reason
these
volumes
survived,
while
others
vanished.
As
a
scholar
of
faith,
Dean
Galloway
had
always
found
it
astonishing
that
the
ancient
spiritual
texts
the
most
studied
books
on
earth
were,
in
fact,
the
least
understood.
Concealed
within
those
pages,
there
hides
a
wondrous
secret.
One
day
soon
the
light
would
dawn,
and
mankind
would
finally
begin
to
grasp
the
simple,
transformative
truth
of
the
ancient
teachings
and
take
a
quantum
leap
forward
in
understanding
his
own
magnificent
nature.
The
winding
staircase
that
descends
the
spine
of
the
Washington
Monument
consists
of
896
stone
steps
that
spiral
around
an
open
elevator
shaft.
Langdon
and
Solomon
were
making
their
way
down,
Langdon
still
grappling
with
the
startling
fact
that
Peter
had
shared
with
him
only
moments
ago:
Robert,
buried
within
the
hollow
cornerstone
of
this
monument,
our
forefathers
placed
a
single
copy
of
the
Word
the
Bible
which
waits
in
darkness
at
the
foot
of
this
staircase.
As
they
descended,
Peter
suddenly
stopped
on
a
landing
and
swung
his
flashlight
beam
to
illuminate
a
large
stone
medallion
embedded
in
the
wall.
What
in
the
world?!
Langdon
jumped
when
he
saw
the
carving.
The
medallion
depicted
a
frightening
cloaked
figure
holding
a
scythe
and
kneeling
beside
an
hourglass.
The
figure's
arm
was
raised,
and
his
index
finger
was
extended,
pointing
directly
at
a
large
open
Bible,
as
if
to
say:
"The
answer
is
in
there!"
Langdon
stared
at
the
carving
and
then
turned
to
Peter.
His
mentor's
eyes
shone
with
mystery.
"I'd
like
you
to
consider
something,
Robert."
His
voice
echoed
down
the
empty
stairwell.
"Why
do
you
think
the
Bible
has
survived
thousands
of
years
of
tumultuous
history?
Why
is
it
still
here?
Is
it
because
its
stories
are
such
compelling
reading?
Of
course
not
but
there
is
a
reason.
There
is
a
reason
Christian
monks
spend
lifetimes
attempting
to
decipher
the
Bible.
There
is
a
reason
that
Jewish
mystics
and
Kabbalists
pore
over
the
Old
Testament.
And
that
reason,
Robert,
is
that
there
exist
powerful
secrets
hidden
in
the
pages
of
this
ancient
book
a
vast
collection
of
untapped
wisdom
waiting
to
be
unveiled."
Langdon
was
no
stranger
to
the
theory
that
the
Scriptures
contained
a
hidden
layer
of
meaning,
a
concealed
message
that
was
veiled
in
allegory,
symbolism,
and
parable.
"The
prophets
warn
us,"
Peter
continued,
"that
the
language
used
to
share
their
secret
mysteries
is
a
cryptic
one.
The
Gospel
of
Mark
tells
us,
'Unto
you
is
given
to
know
the
mystery
but
it
will
be
told
in
parable.'
Proverbs
cautions
that
the
sayings
of
the
wise
are
'riddles,'
while
Corinthians
talks
of
'hidden
wisdom.'
The
Gospel
of
John
forewarns:
T
will
speak
to
you
in
parable
and
use
dark
sayings.'
Dark
sayings,
Langdon
mused,
knowing
this
strange
phrase
made
numerous
odd
appearances
in
Proverbs
as
well
as
in
Psalm
78.
/
will
open
my
mouth
in
a
parable
and
utter
dark
sayings
of
old.
The
concept
of
a
"dark
saying,"
Langdon
had
learned,
did
not
mean
that
the
saying
was
"evil"
but
rather
that
its
true
meaning
was
shadowed
or
obscured
from
the
light.
"And
if
you
have
any
doubts,"
Peter
added,
"Corinthians
overtly
tells
us
that
the
parables
have
two
layers
of
meaning:
'milk
for
babes
and
meat
for
men'
where
the
milk
is
a
watered-down
reading
for
infantile
minds,
and
the
meat
is
the
true
message,
accessible
only
to
mature
minds."
Peter
raised
the
flashlight,
again
illuminating
the
carving
of
the
cloaked
figure
pointing
intently
at
the
Bible.
"I
know
you
are
a
skeptic,
Robert,
but
consider
this.
If
the
Bible
does
not
contain
hidden
meaning,
then
why
have
so
many
of
history's
finest
minds
including
brilliant
scientists
at
the
Royal
Society
become
so
obsessed
with
studying
it?
Sir
Isaac
Newton
wrote
more
than
a
million
words
attempting
to
decipher
the
true
meaning
of
the
Scripture,
including
a
1704
manuscript
that
claimed
he
had
extracted
hidden
scientific
information
from
the
Bible!"
Langdon
knew
this
was
true.
"And
Sir
Francis
Bacon,"
Peter
continued,
"the
luminary
hired
by
King
James
to
literally
create
the
authorized
King
James
Bible,
became
so
utterly
convinced
that
the
Bible
contained
cryptic
meaning
that
he
wrote
in
his
own
codes,
which
are
still
studied
today!
Of
course,
as
you
know,
Bacon
was
a
Rosicrucian
and
penned
The
Wisdom
of
the
Ancients."
Peter
smiled.
"Even
the
iconoclastic
poet
William
Blake
hinted
that
we
should
read
between
the
lines."
Langdon
was
familiar
with
the
verse:
BOTH
READ
THE
BIBLE
DAY
AND
NIGHT,
BUT
THOU
READ
BLACK
WHERE
I
READ
WHITE.
"And
it
wasn't
just
the
European
luminaries,"
Peter
continued,
descending
faster
now.
"It
was
here,
Robert,
at
the
very
core
of
this
young
American
nation,
that
our
brightest
forefathers
John
Adams,
Ben
Franklin,
Thomas
Paine
all
warned
of
the
profound
dangers
of
interpreting
the
Bible
literally.
In
fact,
Thomas
Jefferson
was
so
convinced
the
Bible's
true
message
was
hidden
that
he
literally
cut
up
the
pages
and
reedited
the
book,
attempting,
in
his
words,
'to
do
away
with
the
artificial
scaffolding
and
restore
the
genuine
doctrines.'
Langdon
was
well
aware
of
this
strange
fact.
The
Jeffersonian
Bible
was
still
in
print
today
and
included
many
of
his
controversial
revisions,
among
them
the
removal
of
the
virgin
birth
and
the
resurrection.
Incredibly,
the
Jeffersonian
Bible
had
been
presented
to
every
incoming
member
of
Congress
during
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century.
"Peter,
you
know
I
find
this
topic
fascinating,
and
I
can
understand
that
it
might
be
tempting
for
bright
minds
to
imagine
the
Scriptures
contain
hidden
meaning,
but
it
makes
no
logical
sense
to
me.
Any
skilled
professor
will
tell
you
that
teaching
is
never
done
in
code."
"I'm
sorry?"
"Teachers
teach,
Peter.
We
speak
openly.
Why
would
the
prophets
the
greatest
teachers
in
history
obscure
their
language?
If
they
hoped
to
change
the
world,
why
would
they
speak
in
code?
Why
not
speak
plainly
so
the
world
could
understand?"
Peter
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
as
he
descended,
looking
surprised
by
the
question.
"Robert,
the
Bible
does
not
talk
openly
for
the
same
reason
the
Ancient
Mystery
Schools
were
kept
hidden
for
the
same
reason
the
neophytes
had
to
be
initiated
before
learning
the
secret
teachings
of
the
ages
for
the
same
reason
the
scientists
in
the
Invisible
College
refused
to
share
their
knowledge
with
others.
This
information
is
powerful,
Robert.
The
Ancient
Mysteries
cannot
be
shouted
from
the
rooftops.
The
mysteries
are
a
flaming
torch,
which,
in
the
hands
of
a
master,
can
light
the
way,
but
which,
in
the
hands
of
a
madman,
can
scorch
the
earth."
Langdon
stopped
short.
What
is
he
saying?
"Peter,
I'm
talking
about
the
Bible.
Why
are
you
talking
about
the
Ancient
MysteriesT
Peter
turned.
"Robert,
don't
you
see?
The
Ancient
Mysteries
and
the
Bible
are
the
same
thing."
Langdon
stared
in
bewilderment.
Peter
was
silent
for
several
seconds,
waiting
for
the
concept
to
soak
in.
"The
Bible
is
one
of
the
books
through
which
the
mysteries
have
been
passed
down
through
history.
Its
pages
are
desperately
trying
to
tell
us
the
secret.
Don't
you
understand?
The
'dark
sayings'
in
the
Bible
are
the
whispers
of
the
ancients,
quietly
sharing
with
us
all
of
their
secret
wisdom."
Langdon
said
nothing.
The
Ancient
Mysteries,
as
he
understood
them,
were
a
kind
of
instruction
manual
for
harnessing
the
latent
power
of
the
human
mind
a
recipe
for
personal
apotheosis.
He
had
never
been
able
to
accept
the
power
of
the
mysteries,
and
certainly
the
notion
that
the
Bible
was
somehow
hiding
a
key
to
these
mysteries
was
an
impossible
stretch.
"Peter,
the
Bible
and
the
Ancient
Mysteries
are
total
opposites.
The
mysteries
are
all
about
the
god
within
you
man
as
god.
The
Bible
is
all
about
the
God
above
you
and
man
as
a
powerless
sinner."
"Yes!
Exactly!
You've
put
your
finger
on
the
precise
problem!
The
moment
mankind
separated
himself
from
God,
the
true
meaning
of
the
Word
was
lost.
The
voices
of
the
ancient
masters
have
now
been
drowned
out,
lost
in
the
chaotic
din
of
self
-proclaimed
practitioners
shouting
that
they
alone
understand
the
Word
that
the
Word
is
written
in
their
language
and
none
other."
Peter
continued
down
the
stairs.
"Robert,
you
and
I
both
know
that
the
ancients
would
be
horrified
if
they
saw
how
their
teachings
have
been
perverted
how
religion
has
established
itself
as
a
tollbooth
to
heaven
how
warriors
march
into
battle
believing
God
favors
their
cause.
We've
lost
the
Word,
and
yet
its
true
meaning
is
still
within
reach,
right
before
our
eyes.
It
exists
in
all
the
enduring
texts,
from
the
Bible
to
the
Bhagavad
Gita
to
the
Koran
and
beyond.
All
of
these
texts
are
revered
upon
the
altars
of
Freemasonry
because
Masons
understand
what
the
world
seems
to
have
forgotten
that
each
of
these
texts,
in
its
own
way,
is
quietly
whispering
the
exact
same
message."
Peter's
voice
welled
with
emotion.'Know
ye
not
that
ye
are
gods?'"
Langdon
was
struck
by
the
way
this
famous
ancient
saying
kept
surfacing
tonight.
He
had
reflected
on
it
while
talking
to
Galloway
and
also
at
the
Capitol
Building
while
trying
to
explain
The
Apotheosis
of
Washington.
Peter
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper.
"The
Buddha
said,
'You
are
God
yourself.'
Jesus
taught
that
'the
kingdom
of
God
is
within
you'
and
even
promised
us,
'The
works
I
do,
you
can
do
and
greater.'
Even
the
first
antipope
Hippolytus
of
Rome
quoted
the
same
message,
first
uttered
by
the
gnostic
teacher
Monoimus:
'Abandon
the
search
for
God
instead,
take
yourself
as
the
starting
place.'
Langdon
flashed
on
the
House
of
the
Temple,
where
the
Masonic
Tyler's
chair
bore
two
words
of
guidance
carved
across
its
back:
KNOW
THYSELF.
"A
wise
man
once
told
me,"
Peter
said,
his
voice
faint
now,
"the
only
difference
between
you
and
God
is
that
you
have
forgotten
you
are
divine."
"Peter,
I
hear
you
I
do.
And
I'd
love
to
believe
we
are
gods,
but
I
see
no
gods
walking
our
earth.
I
see
no
superhumans.You
can
point
to
the
alleged
miracles
of
the
Bible,
or
any
other
religious
text,
but
they
are
nothing
but
old
stories
fabricated
by
man
and
then
exaggerated
over
time."
"Perhaps,"
Peter
said.
"Or
perhaps
we
simply
need
our
science
to
catch
up
with
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients."
He
paused.
"Funny
thing
is
I
believe
Katherine's
research
may
be
poised
to
do
just
that."
Langdon
suddenly
remembered
that
Katherine
had
dashed
off
from
the
House
of
the
Temple
earlier.
"Hey,
where
did
she
go,
anyway?"
"She'll
be
here
shortly,"
Peter
said,
grinning.
"She
went
to
confirm
a
wonderful
bit
of
good
fortune."
Outside,
at
the
base
of
the
monument,
Peter
Solomon
felt
invigorated
as
he
inhaled
the
cold
night
air.
He
watched
in
amusement
as
Langdon
stared
intently
at
the
ground,
scratching
his
head
and
looking
around
at
the
foot
of
the
obelisk.
"Professor,"
Peter
joked,
"the
cornerstone
that
contains
the
Bible
is
underground.
You
can't
actually
access
the
book,
but
I
assure
you
it's
there."
"I
believe
you,"
Langdon
said,
appearing
lost
in
thought.
"It'
s
just
I
noticed
something."
Langdon
stepped
back
now
and
surveyed
the
giant
plaza
on
which
the
Washington
Monument
stood.
The
circular
concourse
was
made
entirely
of
white
stone
except
for
two
decorative
courses
of
dark
stone,
which
formed
two
concentric
circles
around
the
monument.
"A
circle
within
a
circle,"
Langdon
said.
"I
never
realized
the
Washington
Monument
stands
at
the
center
of
a
circle
within
a
circle."
Peter
had
to
laugh.
He
misses
nothing.
"Yes,
the
great
circumpunct
the
universal
symbol
for
God
at
the
crossroads
of
America."
He
gave
a
coy
shrug.
"I'm
sure
it's
just
a
coincidence."
Langdon
seemed
far
off,
gazing
skyward
now,
his
eyes
ascending
the
illuminated
spire,
which
shone
stark
white
against
the
black
winter
sky.
Peter
sensed
Langdon
was
beginning
to
see
this
creation
for
what
it
truly
was
a
silent
reminder
of
ancient
wisdom
an
icon
of
enlightened
man
at
the
heart
of
a
great
nation.
Even
though
Peter
could
not
see
the
tiny
aluminum
tip
at
the
top,
he
knew
it
was
there,
man's
enlightened
mind
straining
toward
heaven.
Laus
Deo.
"Peter?"
Langdon
approached,
looking
like
a
man
who'd
endured
some
kind
of
mystical
initiation.
"I
almost
forgot,"
he
said,
reaching
into
his
pocket
and
producing
Peter's
gold
Masonic
ring.
"I've
been
wanting
to
return
this
to
you
all
night."
"Thank
you,
Robert."
Peter
held
out
his
left
hand
and
took
the
ring,
admiring
it.
"You
know,
all
the
secrecy
and
mystery
surrounding
this
ring
and
the
Masonic
Pyramid
it
had
an
enormous
effect
on
my
life.
When
I
was
a
young
man,
the
pyramid
was
given
to
me
with
the
promise
that
it
hid
mystical
secrets.
Its
mere
existence
made
me
believe
there
were
great
mysteries
in
the
world.
It
piqued
my
curiosity,
fueled
my
sense
of
wonder,
and
inspired
me
to
open
my
mind
to
the
Ancient
Mysteries."
He
smiled
quietly
and
slipped
the
ring
into
his
pocket.
"I
now
realize
that
the
Masonic
Pyramid's
true
purpose
was
not
to
reveal
the
answers,
but
rather
to
inspire
a
fascination
with
them."
The
two
men
stood
in
silence
for
a
long
while
at
the
foot
of
the
monument.
When
Langdon
finally
spoke,
his
tone
was
serious.
"I
need
to
ask
you
a
favor,
Peter
as
a
friend."
"Of
course.
Anything."
Langdon
made
his
request
firmly.
Solomon
nodded,
knowing
he
was
right.
"I
will."
"Right
away,"
Langdon
added,
motioning
to
the
waiting
Escalade.
"Okay
but
one
caveat."
Langdon
rolled
his
eyes,
chuckling.
"Somehow
you
always
get
the
last
word."
"Yes,
and
there
is
one
final
thing
I
want
you
and
Katherine
to
see."
"At
this
hour?"
Langdon
checked
his
watch.
Solomon
smiled
warmly
at
his
old
friend.
"It
is
Washington's
most
spectacular
treasure
and
something
very,
very
few
people
have
ever
seen."
Katherine
Solomon's
heart
felt
light
as
she
hurried
up
the
hill
toward
the
base
of
the
Washington
Monument.
She
had
endured
great
shock
and
tragedy
tonight,
and
yet
her
thoughts
were
refocused
now,
if
only
temporarily,
on
the
wonderful
news
Peter
had
shared
with
her
earlier
news
she
had
just
confirmed
with
her
very
own
eyes.
My
research
is
safe.
All
of
it.
Her
lab's
holographic
data
drives
had
been
destroyed
tonight,
but
earlier,
at
the
House
of
the
Temple,
Peter
had
informed
her
that
he
had
been
secretly
keeping
backups
of
all
her
Noetic
research
in
the
SMSC
executive
offices.
You
know
I'm
utterly
fascinated
with
your
work,
he
had
explained,
and
I
wanted
to
follow
your
progress
without
disturbing
you.
"Katherine?"
a
deep
voice
called
out.
She
looked
up.
A
lone
figure
stood
in
silhouette
at
the
base
of
the
illuminated
monument.
"Robert!"
She
hurried
over
and
hugged
him.
"I
heard
the
good
news,"
Langdon
whispered.
"You
must
be
relieved."
Her
voice
cracked
with
emotion.
"Incredibly."
The
research
Peter
had
saved
was
a
scientific
tour
de
force
a
massive
collection
of
experiments
that
proved
human
thought
was
a
real
and
measurable
force
in
the
world.
Katherine'
s
experiments
demonstrated
the
effect
of
human
thought
on
everything
from
ice
crystals
to
random-event
generators
to
the
movement
of
subatomic
particles.
The
results
were
conclusive
and
irrefutable,
with
the
potential
to
transform
skeptics
into
believers
and
affect
global
consciousness
on
a
massive
scale.
"Everything
is
going
to
change,
Robert.
Everything."
"Peter
certainly
thinks
so."
Katherine
glanced
around
for
her
brother.
"Hospital,"
Langdon
said.
"I
insisted
he
go
as
a
favor
to
me."
Katherine
exhaled,
relieved.
"Thank
you."
"He
told
me
to
wait
for
you
here."
Katherine
nodded,
her
gaze
climbing
the
glowing
white
obelisk.
"He
said
he
was
bringing
you
here.
Something
about
'Laus
Deo'l
He
didn't
elaborate."
Langdon
gave
a
tired
chuckle.
"I'm
not
sure
I
entirely
understand
it
myself."
He
glanced
up
at
the
top
of
the
monument.
"Your
brother
said
quite
a
few
things
tonight
that
I
couldn't
get
my
mind
around."
"Let
me
guess,"
Katherine
said.
"Ancient
Mysteries,
science,
and
the
Holy
Scriptures?"
"Bingo."
"Welcome
to
my
world."
She
winked.
"Peter
initiated
me
into
this
long
ago.
It
fueled
a
lot
of
my
research."
"Intuitively,
some
of
what
he
said
made
sense."
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"But
intellectually"
Katherine
smiled
and
put
her
arm
around
him.
"You
know,
Robert,
I
may
be
able
to
help
you
with
that."
Deep
inside
the
Capitol
Building,
Architect
Warren
Bellamy
was
walking
down
a
deserted
hallway.
Only
one
thing
left
to
do
tonight,
he
thought.
When
he
arrived
at
his
office,
he
retrieved
a
very
old
key
from
his
desk
drawer.
The
key
was
black
iron,
long
and
slender,
with
faded
markings.
He
slid
it
into
his
pocket
and
then
prepared
himself
to
welcome
his
guests.
Robert
Langdon
and
Katherine
Solomon
were
on
their
way
to
the
Capitol.
At
Peter's
request,
Bellamy
was
to
provide
them
with
a
very
rare
opportunity
the
chance
to
lay
eyes
upon
this
building's
most
magnificent
secret
something
that
could
be
revealed
only
by
the
Architect.
High
above
the
floor
of
the
Capitol
Rotunda,
Robert
Langdon
inched
nervously
around
the
circular
catwalk
that
extended
just
beneath
the
ceiling
of
the
dome.
He
peered
tentatively
over
the
railing,
dizzied
by
the
height,
still
unable
to
believe
it
had
been
less
than
ten
hours
since
Peter's
hand
had
appeared
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
below.
On
that
same
floor,
the
Architect
of
the
Capitol
was
now
a
tiny
speck
some
hundred
and
eighty
feet
below,
moving
steadily
across
the
Rotunda
and
then
disappearing.
Bellamy
had
escorted
Langdon
and
Katherine
up
to
this
balcony,
leaving
them
here
with
very
specific
instructions.
Peter's
instructions.
Langdon
eyed
the
old
iron
key
that
Bellamy
had
handed
to
him.
Then
he
glanced
over
at
a
cramped
stairwell
that
ascended
from
this
level
climbing
higher
still.
God
help
me.
These
narrow
stairs,
according
to
the
Architect,
led
up
to
a
small
metal
door
that
could
be
unlocked
with
the
iron
key
in
Langdon'
s
hand.
Beyond
the
door
lay
something
that
Peter
insisted
Langdon
and
Katherine
see.
Peter
had
not
elaborated,
but
rather
had
left
strict
instructions
regarding
the
precise
hour
at
which
the
door
was
to
be
opened.
We
have
to
wait
to
open
the
door?
Why?
Langdon
checked
his
watch
again
and
groaned.
Slipping
the
key
into
his
pocket,
he
gazed
across
the
gaping
void
before
him
at
the
far
side
of
the
balcony.
Katherine
had
walked
fearlessly
ahead,
apparently
unfazed
by
the
height.
She
was
now
halfway
around
the
circumference,
admiring
every
inch
of
Brumidi's
The
Apotheosis
of
Washington,
which
loomed
directly
over
their
heads.
From
this
rare
vantage
point,
the
fifteen-foot-tall
figures
that
adorned
the
nearly
five
thousand
square
feet
of
the
Capitol
Dome
were
visible
in
astonishing
detail.
Langdon
turned
his
back
to
Katherine,
faced
the
outer
wall,
and
whispered
very
quietly,
"Katherine,
this
is
your
conscience
speaking.
Why
did
you
abandon
Robert?"
Katherine
was
apparently
familiar
with
the
dome's
startling
acoustical
properties
because
the
wall
whispered
back.
"Because
Robert
is
being
a
chicken.
He
should
come
over
here
with
me.
We
have
plenty
of
time
before
we're
allowed
to
open
that
door."
Langdon
knew
she
was
right
and
reluctantly
made
his
way
around
the
balcony,
hugging
the
wall
as
he
went.
"This
ceiling
is
absolutely
amazing,"
Katherine
marveled,
her
neck
craned
to
take
in
the
enormous
splendor
of
the
Apotheosis
overhead.
"Mythical
gods
all
mixed
in
with
scientific
inventors
and
their
creations?
And
to
think
this
is
the
image
at
the
center
of
our
Capitol."
Langdon
turned
his
eyes
upward
to
the
sprawling
forms
of
Franklin,
Fulton,
and
Morse
with
their
technological
inventions.
A
shining
rainbow
arched
away
from
these
figures,
guiding
his
eye
to
George
Washington
ascending
to
heaven
on
a
cloud.
The
great
promise
of
man
becoming
God.
Katherine
said,
"It's
as
if
the
entire
essence
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries
is
hovering
over
the
Rotunda."
Langdon
had
to
admit,
not
many
frescoes
in
the
world
fused
scientific
inventions
with
mythical
gods
and
human
apotheosis.
This
ceiling's
spectacular
collection
of
images
was
indeed
a
message
of
the
Ancient
Mysteries,
and
it
was
here
for
a
reason.
The
founding
fathers
had
envisioned
America
as
a
blank
canvas,
a
fertile
field
on
which
the
seeds
of
the
mysteries
could
be
sown.
Today,
this
soaring
icon
the
father
of
our
country
ascending
to
heaven
hung
silently
above
our
lawmakers,
leaders,
and
presidents
a
bold
reminder,
a
map
to
the
future,
a
promise
of
a
time
when
man
would
evolve
to
complete
spiritual
maturity.
"Robert,"
Katherine
whispered,
her
gaze
still
fixated
on
the
massive
figures
of
America's
great
inventors
accompanied
by
Minerva.
"It's
prophetic,
really.
Today,
man's
most
advanced
inventions
are
being
used
to
study
man's
most
ancient
ideas.
The
science
of
Noetics
may
be
new,
but
it's
actually
the
oldest
science
on
earth
the
study
of
human
thought."
She
turned
to
him
now,
her
eyes
filled
with
wonder.
"And
we're
learning
that
the
ancients
actually
understood
thought
more
profoundly
than
we
do
today."
"Makes
sense,"
Langdon
replied.
"The
human
mind
was
the
only
technology
the
ancients
had
at
their
disposal.
The
early
philosophers
studied
it
relentlessly."
"Yes
!
The
ancient
texts
are
obsessed
with
the
power
of
the
human
mind.
The
Vedas
describe
the
flow
of
mind
energy.
The
Pistis
Sophia
describes
universal
consciousness.
The
Zohar
explores
the
nature
of
mind
spirit.
The
Shamanic
texts
predict
Einstein's
'remote
influence'
in
terms
of
healing
at
a
distance.
It's
all
there!
And
don't
even
get
me
started
about
the
Bible."
"You,
too?"
Langdon
said,
chuckling.
"Your
brother
tried
to
convince
me
that
the
Bible
is
encoded
with
scientific
information."
"It
certainly
is"
she
said.
"And
if
you
don't
believe
Peter,
read
some
of
Newton's
esoteric
texts
on
the
Bible.
When
you
start
to
understand
the
cryptic
parables
in
the
Bible,
Robert,
you
realize
it's
a
study
of
the
human
mind."
Langdon
shrugged.
"I
guess
I'd
better
go
back
and
read
it
again."
"Let
me
ask
you
something,"
she
said,
clearly
not
appreciating
his
skepticism.
"When
the
Bible
tells
us
to
'go
build
our
temple'
a
temple
that
we
must
'build
with
no
tools
and
making
no
noise,'
what
temple
do
you
think
it'
s
talking
about?"
"Well,
the
text
does
say
your
body
is
a
temple."
"Yes,
Corinthians
3:16.
You
are
the
temple
of
God."
She
smiled
at
him.
"And
the
Gospel
of
John
says
the
exact
same
thing.
Robert,
the
Scriptures
are
well
aware
of
the
power
latent
within
us,
and
they
are
urging
us
to
harness
that
power
urging
us
to
build
the
temples
of
our
minds."
"Unfortunately,
I
think
much
of
the
religious
world
is
waiting
for
a
real
temple
to
be
rebuilt.
It's
part
of
the
Messianic
Prophecy."
"Yes,
but
that
overlooks
an
important
point.
The
Second
Coming
is
the
coming
of
man
the
moment
when
mankind
finally
builds
the
temple
of
his
mind."
"I
don't
know,"
Langdon
said,
rubbing
his
chin.
"I'm
no
Bible
scholar,
but
I'm
pretty
sure
the
Scriptures
describe
in
detail
a
physical
temple
that
needs
to
be
built.
The
structure
is
described
as
being
in
two
parts
an
outer
temple
called
the
Holy
Place
and
an
inner
sanctuary
called
the
Holy
of
Holies.
The
two
parts
are
separated
from
each
other
by
a
thin
veil."
Katherine
grinned.
"Pretty
good
recall
for
a
Bible
skeptic.
By
the
way,
have
you
ever
seen
an
actual
human
brain?
It's
built
in
two
parts
an
outer
part
called
the
dura
mater
and
an
inner
part
called
the
pia
mater.
These
two
parts
are
separated
by
the
arachnoid
a
veil
of
weblike
tissue."
Langdon
cocked
his
head
in
surprise.
Gently,
she
reached
up
and
touched
Langdon'
s
temple.
"There's
a
reason
they
call
this
your
temple,
Robert."
As
Langdon
tried
to
process
what
Katherine
had
said,
he
flashed
unexpectedly
on
the
gnostic
Gospel
of
Mary:
Where
the
mind
is,
there
is
the
treasure.
"Perhaps
you've
heard,"
Katherine
said,
softly
now,
"about
the
brain
scans
taken
of
yogis
while
they
meditate?
The
human
brain,
in
advanced
states
of
focus,
will
physically
create
a
waxlike
substance
from
the
pineal
gland.
This
brain
secretion
is
unlike
anything
else
in
the
body.
It
has
an
incredible
healing
effect,
can
literally
regenerate
cells,
and
may
be
one
of
the
reasons
yogis
live
so
long.
This
is
real
science,
Robert.
This
substance
has
inconceivable
properties
and
can
be
created
only
by
a
mind
that
is
highly
tuned
to
a
deeply
focused
state."
"I
remember
reading
about
that
a
few
years
back."
"Yes,
and
on
that
topic,
you're
familiar
with
the
Bible's
account
of
'manna
from
heaven'?"
Langdon
saw
no
connection.
"You
mean
the
magical
substance
that
fell
from
heaven
to
nourish
the
hungry?"
"Exactly.
The
substance
was
said
to
heal
the
sick,
provide
everlasting
life,
and,
strangely,
cause
no
waste
in
those
who
consumed
it."
Katherine
paused,
as
if
waiting
for
him
to
understand.
"Robert?"
she
prodded.
"A
kind
of
nourishment
that
fell
from
heaven?"
She
tapped
her
temple.
"Magically
heals
the
body?
Creates
no
waste?
Don't
you
see?
These
are
code
words,
Robert!
Temple
is
code
for
'body.'
Heaven
is
code
for
'mind.'
Jacob's
ladder
is
your
spine.
And
manna
is
this
rare
brain
secretion.
When
you
see
these
code
words
in
Scripture,
pay
attention.
They
are
often
markers
for
a
more
profound
meaning
concealed
beneath
the
surface."
Katherine'
s
words
were
coming
out
in
rapid-fire
succession
now,
explaining
how
this
same
magical
substance
appeared
throughout
the
Ancient
Mysteries:
Nectar
of
the
Gods,
Elixir
of
Life,
Fountain
of
Youth,
Philosopher's
Stone,
ambrosia,
dew,
ojas,
soma.
Then
she
launched
into
an
explanation
about
the
brain's
pineal
gland
representing
the
all-seeing
eye
of
God.
"According
to
Matthew
6:22,"
she
said
excitedly,
'when
your
eye
is
single,
your
body
fills
with
light.'
This
concept
is
also
represented
by
the
Ajna
chakra
and
the
dot
on
a
Hindu's
forehead,
which
Katherine
stopped
short,
looking
sheepish.
"Sorry
I
know
I'm
rambling.
I
just
find
this
all
so
exhilarating.
For
years
I've
studied
the
ancients'
claims
of
man's
awesome
mental
power,
and
now
science
is
showing
us
that
accessing
that
power
is
an
actual
physical
process.
Our
brains,
if
used
correctly,
can
call
forth
powers
that
are
quite
literally
superhuman.
The
Bible,
like
many
ancient
texts,
is
a
detailed
exposition
of
the
most
sophisticated
machine
ever
created
the
human
mind.She
sighed.
"Incredibly,
science
has
yet
to
scratch
the
surface
of
the
mind's
full
promise."
"It
sounds
like
your
work
in
Noetics
will
be
a
quantum
leap
forward."
"Or
backward,"
she
said.
"The
ancients
already
knew
many
of
the
scientific
truths
we're
now
rediscovering.
Within
a
matter
of
years,
modern
man
will
be
forced
to
accept
what
is
now
unthinkable:
our
minds
can
generate
energy
capable
of
transforming
physical
matter."
She
paused.
"Particles
react
to
our
thoughts
which
means
our
thoughts
have
the
power
to
change
the
world."
Langdon
smiled
softly.
"What
my
research
has
brought
me
to
believe
is
this,"
Katherine
said.
"God
is
very
real
a
mental
energy
that
pervades
everything.
And
we,
as
human
beings,
have
been
created
in
that
image
"I'm
sorry?"
Langdon
interrupted.
"Created
in
the
image
of
mental
energy?"
"Exactly.
Our
physical
bodies
have
evolved
over
the
ages,
but
it
was
our
minds
that
were
created
in
the
image
of
God.
We've
been
reading
the
Bible
too
literally.
We
learn
that
God
created
us
in
his
image,
but
it's
not
our
physical
bodies
that
resemble
God,
it's
our
minds."
Langdon
was
silent
now,
fully
engrossed.
"This
is
the
great
gift,
Robert,
and
God
is
waiting
for
us
to
understand
it.
All
around
the
world,
we
are
gazing
skyward,
waiting
for
God
never
realizing
that
God
is
waiting
for
us."
Katherine
paused,
letting
her
words
soak
in.
"We
are
creators,
and
yet
we
naively
play
the
role
of
'the
created.''
We
see
ourselves
as
helpless
sheep
buffeted
around
by
the
God
who
made
us.
We
kneel
like
frightened
children,
begging
for
help,
for
forgiveness,
for
good
luck.
But
once
we
realize
that
we
are
truly
created
in
the
Creator's
image,
we
will
start
to
understand
that
we,
too,
must
be
Creators.
When
we
understand
this
fact,
the
doors
will
burst
wide
open
for
human
potential."
Langdon
recalled
a
passage
that
had
always
stuck
with
him
from
the
work
of
the
philosopher
Manly
P.
Hall:
If
the
infinite
had
not
desired
man
to
be
wise,
he
would
not
have
bestowed
upon
him
the
faculty
of
knowing.
Langdon
gazed
up
again
at
the
image
of
The
Apotheosis
of
Washington
the
symbolic
ascent
of
man
to
deity.
The
created
becoming
the
Creator.
"The
most
amazing
part,"
Katherine
said,
"is
that
as
soon
as
we
humans
begin
to
harness
our
true
power,
we
will
have
enormous
control
over
our
world.
We
will
be
able
to
design
reality
rather
than
merely
react
to
it."
Langdon
lowered
his
gaze.
"That
sounds
dangerous."
Katherine
looked
startled
and
impressed.
"Yes,
exactly!
If
thoughts
affect
the
world,
then
we
must
be
very
careful
how
we
think.
Destructive
thoughts
have
influence,
too,
and
we
all
know
it's
far
easier
to
destroy
than
it
is
to
create."
Langdon
thought
of
all
the
lore
about
needing
to
protect
the
ancient
wisdom
from
the
unworthy
and
share
it
only
with
the
enlightened.
He
thought
of
the
Invisible
College,
and
the
great
scientist
Isaac
Newton's
request
to
Robert
Boyle
to
keep
"high
silence"
about
their
secret
research.
It
cannot
be
communicated,
Newton
wrote
in
1676,
without
immense
damage
to
the
world.
"There's
an
interesting
twist
here,"
Katherine
said.
"The
great
irony
is
that
all
the
religions
of
the
world,
for
centuries,
have
been
urging
their
followers
to
embrace
the
concepts
of
faith
and
belief.
Now
science,
which
for
centuries
has
derided
religion
as
superstition,
must
admit
that
its
next
big
frontier
is
quite
literally
the
science
of
faith
and
belief
the
power
of
focused
conviction
and
intention.
The
same
science
that
eroded
our
faith
in
the
miraculous
is
now
building
a
bridge
back
across
the
chasm
it
created."
Langdon
considered
her
words
for
a
long
time.
Slowly
he
raised
his
eyes
again
to
the
Apotheosis.
"I
have
a
question,"
he
said,
looking
back
at
Katherine.
"Even
if
I
could
accept,
just
for
an
instant,
that
I
have
the
power
to
change
physical
matter
with
my
mind,
and
literally
manifest
all
that
I
desire
I'm
afraid
I
see
nothing
in
my
life
to
make
me
believe
I
have
such
power."
She
shrugged.
"Then
you're
not
looking
hard
enough."
"Come
on,
I
want
a
real
answer.
That'
s
the
answer
of
a
priest.
I
want
the
answer
of
a
scientist."
"You
want
a
real
answer?
Here
it
is.
If
I
hand
you
a
violin
and
say
you
have
the
capability
to
use
it
to
make
incredible
music,
I
am
not
lying.
You
do
have
the
capability,
but
you'll
need
enormous
amounts
of
practice
to
manifest
it.
This
is
no
different
from
learning
to
use
your
mind,
Robert.
Well-directed
thought
is
a
learned
skill.
To
manifest
an
intention
requires
laserlike
focus,
full
sensory
visualization,
and
a
profound
belief.
We
have
proven
this
in
a
lab.
And
just
like
playing
a
violin,
there
are
people
who
exhibit
greater
natural
ability
than
others.
Look
to
history.
Look
to
the
stories
of
those
enlightened
minds
who
performed
miraculous
feats."
"Katherine,
please
don't
tell
me
you
actually
believe
in
the
miracles.
I
mean,
seriously
turning
water
into
wine,
healing
the
sick
with
the
touch
of
a
hand?"
Katherine
took
a
long
breath
and
blew
it
out
slowly.
"I
have
witnessed
people
transform
cancer
cells
into
healthy
cells
simply
by
thinking
about
them.
I
have
witnessed
human
minds
affecting
the
physical
world
in
myriad
ways.
And
once
you
see
that
happen,
Robert,
once
this
becomes
part
of
your
reality,
then
some
of
the
miracles
you
read
about
become
simply
a
matter
of
degree."
Langdon
was
pensive.
"It's
an
inspiring
way
to
see
the
world,
Katherine,
but
for
me,
it
just
feels
like
an
impossible
leap
of
faith.
And
as
you
know,
faith
has
never
come
easily
for
me."
"Then
don't
think
of
it
as
faith.
Think
of
it
simply
as
changing
your
perspective,
accepting
that
the
world
is
not
precisely
as
you
imagine.
Historically,
every
major
scientific
breakthrough
began
with
a
simple
idea
that
threatened
to
overturn
all
of
our
beliefs.
The
simple
statement
'the
earth
is
round'
was
mocked
as
utterly
impossible
because
most
people
believed
the
oceans
would
flow
off
the
planet.
Heliocentricity
was
called
heresy.
Small
minds
have
always
lashed
out
at
what
they
don't
understand.
There
are
those
who
create
and
those
who
tear
down.
That
dynamic
has
existed
for
all
time.
But
eventually
the
creators
find
believers,
and
the
number
of
believers
reaches
a
critical
mass,
and
suddenly
the
world
becomes
round,
or
the
solar
system
becomes
heliocentric.
Perception
is
transformed,
and
a
new
reality
is
born."
Langdon
nodded,
his
thoughts
drifting
now.
"You
have
a
funny
look
on
your
face,"
she
said.
"Oh,
I
don't
know.
For
some
reason
I
was
just
remembering
how
I
used
to
canoe
out
into
the
middle
of
the
lake
late
at
night,
lie
down
under
the
stars,
and
think
about
stuff
like
this."
She
nodded
knowingly.
"I
think
we
all
have
a
similar
memory.
Something
about
lying
on
our
backs
staring
up
at
the
heavens
opens
the
mind."
She
glanced
up
at
the
ceiling
and
then
said,
"Give
me
your
jacket."
"What?"
He
took
it
off
and
gave
it
to
her.
She
folded
it
twice
and
laid
it
down
on
the
catwalk
like
a
long
pillow.
"Lie
down."
Langdon
lay
on
his
back,
and
Katherine
positioned
his
head
on
half
of
the
folded
jacket.
Then
she
lay
down
beside
him
two
kids,
shoulder
to
shoulder
on
the
narrow
catwalk,
staring
up
at
Brumidi's
enormous
fresco.
"Okay,"
she
whispered.
"Put
yourself
in
that
same
mind-set
a
kid
lying
out
in
a
canoe
looking
up
at
the
stars
his
mind
open
and
full
of
wonder."
Langdon
tried
to
obey,
although
at
the
moment,
prone
and
comfortable,
he
was
feeling
a
sudden
wave
of
exhaustion.
As
his
vision
blurred,
he
perceived
a
muted
shape
overhead
that
immediately
woke
him.
Is
that
possible?
He
could
not
believe
he
hadn't
noticed
it
before,
but
the
figures
in
The
Apotheosis
of
Washington
were
clearly
arranged
in
two
concentric
rings
a
circle
within
a
circle.
The
Apotheosis
is
also
a
circumpunct?
Langdon
wondered
what
else
he
had
missed
tonight.
"There's
something
important
I
want
to
tell
you,
Robert.
There's
another
piece
to
all
this
a
piece
that
I
believe
is
the
single
most
astonishing
aspect
of
my
research."
There
's
more
?
Katherine
propped
herself
on
her
elbow.
"And
I
promise
if
we
as
humans
can
honestly
grasp
this
one
simple
truth
the
world
will
change
overnight."
She
now
had
his
full
attention.
"I
should
preface
this,"
she
said,
"by
reminding
you
of
the
Masonic
mantras
to
'gather
what
is
scattered'
to
bring
'order
from
chaos'
to
find
'at-one-ment.'
"Go
on."
Langdon
was
intrigued.
Katherine
smiled
down
at
him.
"We
have
scientifically
proven
that
the
power
of
human
thought
grows
exponentially
with
the
number
of
minds
that
share
that
thought."
Langdon
remained
silent,
wondering
where
she
was
going
with
this
idea.
"What
I'm
saying
is
this
two
heads
are
better
than
one
and
yet
two
heads
are
not
twice
better,
they
are
many,
many
times
better.
Multiple
minds
working
in
unison
magnify
a
thought's
effect
exponentially.
This
is
the
inherent
power
of
prayer
groups,
healing
circles,
singing
in
unison,
and
worshipping
en
masse.
The
idea
of
universal
consciousness
is
no
ethereal
New
Age
concept.
It's
a
hard-core
scientific
reality
and
harnessing
it
has
the
potential
to
transform
our
world.
This
is
the
underlying
discovery
of
Noetic
Science.
What's
more,
it's
happening
right
now.
You
can
feel
it
all
around
you.
Technology
is
linking
us
in
ways
we
never
imagined
possible:
Twitter,
Google,
Wikipedia,
and
others
all
blend
to
create
a
web
of
interconnected
minds."
She
laughed.
"And
I
guarantee
you,
as
soon
as
I
publish
my
work,
the
Twitterati
will
all
be
sending
tweets
that
say,
"learning
about
Noetics,'
and
interest
in
this
science
will
explode
exponentially."
Langdon'
s
eyelids
felt
impossibly
heavy.
"You
know,
I
still
haven't
learned
how
to
send
a
twitter."
"A
tweet"
she
corrected,
laughing.
"I'm
sorry?"
"Never
mind.
Close
your
eyes.
I'll
wake
you
when
it's
time."
Langdon
realized
he
had
all
but
forgotten
the
old
key
the
Architect
had
given
them
and
why
they
had
come
up
here.
As
a
new
wave
of
exhaustion
engulfed
him,
Langdon
shut
his
eyes.
In
the
darkness
of
his
mind,
he
found
himself
thinking
about
universal
consciousness
about
Plato's
writings
on
"the
mind
of
the
world"
and
"gathering
God"
Jung's
"collective
unconscious."
The
notion
was
as
simple
as
it
was
startling.
God
is
found
in
the
collection
of
Many
rather
than
in
the
One.
"Elohim,"
Langdon
said
suddenly,
his
eyes
flying
open
again
as
he
made
an
unexpected
connection.
"I'm
sorry?"
Katherine
was
still
gazing
down
at
him.
"Elohim,"
he
repeated.
"The
Hebrew
word
for
God
in
the
Old
Testament!
I've
always
wondered
about
it."
Katherine
gave
a
knowing
smile.
"Yes.
The
word
is
plural."
Exactly!
Langdon
had
never
understood
why
the
very
first
passages
of
the
Bible
referred
to
God
as
a
plural
being.
Elohim.
The
Almighty
God
in
Genesis
was
described
not
as
One
but
as
Many.
"God
is
plural,"
Katherine
whispered,
"because
the
minds
of
man
are
plural."
Langdon'
s
thoughts
were
spiraling
now
dreams,
memories,
hopes,
fears,
revelations
all
swirling
above
him
in
the
Rotunda
dome.
As
his
eyes
began
to
close
again,
he
found
himself
staring
at
three
words
in
Latin,
painted
within
the
Apotheosis.
E
PLURIBUS
UNUM.
"Out
of
many,
one,he
thought,
slipping
off
into
sleep.
Epilogue
Robert
Langdon
awoke
slowly.
Faces
gazed
down
at
him.
Where
am
I?
A
moment
later,
he
recalled
where
he
was.
He
sat
up
slowly
beneath
the
Apotheosis.
His
back
felt
stiff
from
lying
on
the
hard
catwalk.
Where's
Katherine?
Langdon
checked
his
Mickey
Mouse
watch.
It's
almost
time.
He
pulled
himself
to
his
feet,
peering
cautiously
over
the
banister
into
the
gaping
space
below.
"Katherine?"
he
called
out.
The
word
echoed
back
in
the
silence
of
the
deserted
Rotunda.
Retrieving
his
tweed
jacket
from
the
floor,
he
brushed
it
off
and
put
it
back
on.
He
checked
his
pockets.
The
iron
key
the
Architect
had
given
him
was
gone.
Making
his
way
back
around
the
walkway,
Langdon
headed
for
the
opening
the
Architect
had
shown
them
.
.
.
steep
metal
stairs
ascending
into
cramped
darkness.
He
began
to
climb.
Higher
and
higher
he
ascended.
Gradually
the
stairway
became
more
narrow
and
more
inclined.
Still
Langdon
pushed
on.
Just
a
little
farther.
The
steps
had
become
almost
ladderlike
now,
the
passage
frighteningly
constricted.
Finally,
the
stairs
ended,
and
Langdon
stepped
up
onto
a
small
landing.
Before
him
was
a
heavy
metal
door.
The
iron
key
was
in
the
lock,
and
the
door
hung
slightly
ajar.
He
pushed,
and
the
door
creaked
open.
The
air
beyond
felt
cold.
As
Langdon
stepped
across
the
threshold
into
murky
darkness,
he
realized
he
was
now
outside.
"I
was
just
coming
to
get
you,"
Katherine
said,
smiling
at
him.
"It's
almost
time."
When
Langdon
recognized
his
surroundings,
he
drew
a
startled
breath.
He
was
standing
on
a
tiny
skywalk
that
encircled
the
pinnacle
of
the
U.S.
Capitol
Dome.
Directly
above
him,
the
bronze
Statue
of
Freedom
gazed
out
over
the
sleeping
capital
city.
She
faced
the
east,
where
the
first
crimson
splashes
of
dawn
had
begun
to
paint
the
horizon.
Katherine
guided
Langdon
around
the
balcony
until
they
were
facing
west,
perfectly
aligned
with
the
National
Mall.
In
the
distance,
the
silhouette
of
the
Washington
Monument
stood
in
the
early-morning
light.
From
this
vantage
point,
the
towering
obelisk
looked
even
more
impressive
than
it
had
before.
"When
it
was
built,"
Katherine
whispered,
"it
was
the
tallest
structure
on
the
entire
planet."
Langdon
pictured
the
old
sepia
photographs
of
stonemasons
on
scaffolding,
more
than
five
hundred
feet
in
the
air,
laying
each
block
by
hand,
one
by
one.
We
are
builders,
he
thought.
We
are
creators.
Since
the
beginning
of
time,
man
had
sensed
there
was
something
special
about
himself
something
more.
He
had
longed
for
powers
he
did
not
possess.
He
had
dreamed
of
flying,
of
healing,
and
of
transforming
his
world
in
every
way
imaginable.
And
he
had
done
just
that.
Today,
the
shrines
to
man's
accomplishments
adorned
the
National
Mall.
The
Smithsonian
museums
burgeoned
with
our
inventions,
our
art,
our
science,
and
the
ideas
of
our
great
thinkers.
They
told
the
history
of
man
as
creator
from
the
stone
tools
in
the
Native
American
History
Museum
to
the
jets
and
rockets
in
the
National
Air
and
Space
Museum.
If
our
ancestors
could
see
us
today,
surely
they
would
think
us
gods.
As
Langdon
peered
through
the
predawn
mist
at
the
sprawling
geometry
of
museums
and
monuments
before
him,
his
eyes
returned
to
the
Washington
Monument.
He
pictured
the
lone
Bible
in
the
buried
cornerstone
and
thought
of
how
the
Word
of
God
was
really
the
word
of
man.
He
thought
about
the
great
circumpunct,
and
how
it
had
been
embedded
in
the
circular
plaza
beneath
the
monument
at
the
crossroads
of
America.
Langdon
thought
suddenly
of
the
little
stone
box
Peter
had
entrusted
to
him.
The
cube,
he
now
realized,
had
unhinged
and
opened
to
form
the
same
exact
geometrical
form
a
cross
with
a
circumpunct
at
its
center.
Langdon
had
to
laugh.
Even
that
little
box
was
hinting
at
this
crossroads.
"Robert,
look!"
Katherine
pointed
to
the
top
of
the
monument.
Langdon
lifted
his
gaze
but
saw
nothing.
Then,
staring
more
intently,
he
glimpsed
it.
Across
the
Mall,
a
tiny
speck
of
golden
sunlight
was
glinting
off
the
highest
tip
of
the
towering
obelisk.
The
shining
pinpoint
grew
quickly
brighter,
more
radiant,
gleaming
on
the
capstone's
aluminum
peak.
Langdon
watched
in
wonder
as
the
light
transformed
into
a
beacon
that
hovered
above
the
shadowed
city.
He
pictured
the
tiny
engraving
on
the
east-facing
side
of
the
aluminum
tip
and
realized
to
his
amazement
that
the
first
ray
of
sunlight
to
hit
the
nation's
capital,
every
single
day,
did
so
by
illuminating
two
words:
Laus
Deo.
"Robert,"
Katherine
whispered.
"Nobody
ever
gets
to
come
up
here
at
sunrise.
This
is
what
Peter
wanted
us
to
witness."
Langdon
could
feel
his
pulse
quickening
as
the
glow
atop
the
monument
intensified.
"He
said
he
believes
this
is
why
the
forefathers
built
the
monument
so
tall.
I
don't
know
if
that's
true,
but
I
do
know
this
there's
a
very
old
law
decreeing
that
nothing
taller
can
be
built
in
our
capital
city.
Ever."
The
light
inched
farther
down
the
capstone
as
the
sun
crept
over
the
horizon
behind
them.
As
Langdon
watched,
he
could
almost
sense,
all
around
him,
the
celestial
spheres
tracing
their
eternal
orbits
through
the
void
of
space.
He
thought
of
the
Great
Architect
of
the
Universe
and
how
Peter
had
said
specifically
that
the
treasure
he
wanted
to
show
Langdon
could
be
unveiled
only
by
the
Architect.
Langdon
had
assumed
this
meant
Warren
Bellamy.
Wrong
Architect.
As
the
rays
of
sunlight
strengthened,
the
golden
glow
engulfed
the
entirety
of
the
thirty-three-hundred-pound
capstone.
The
mind
of
man
receiving
enlightenment.
The
light
then
began
inching
down
the
monument,
commencing
the
same
descent
it
performed
every
morning.
Heaven
moving
toward
earth
God
connecting
to
man.
This
process,
Langdon
realized,
would
reverse
come
evening.
The
sun
would
dip
in
the
west,
and
the
light
would
climb
again
from
earth
back
to
heaven
preparing
for
a
new
day.
Beside
him,
Katherine
shivered
and
inched
closer.
Langdon
put
his
arm
around
her.
As
the
two
of
them
stood
side
by
side
in
silence,
Langdon
thought
about
all
he
had
learned
tonight.
He
thought
of
Katherine'
s
belief
that
everything
was
about
to
change.
He
thought
of
Peter's
faith
that
an
age
of
enlightenment
was
imminent.
And
he
thought
of
the
words
of
a
great
prophet
who
had
boldly
declared:
Nothing
is
hidden
that
will
not
be
made
known;
nothing
is
secret
that
will
not
come
to
light.
As
the
sun
rose
over
Washington,
Langdon
looked
to
the
heavens,
where
the
last
of
the
nighttime
stars
were
fading
out.
He
thought
about
science,
about
faith,
about
man.
He
thought
about
how
every
culture,
in
every
country,
in
every
time,
had
always
shared
one
thing.
We
all
had
the
Creator.
We
used
different
names,
different
faces,
and
different
prayers,
but
God
was
the
universal
constant
for
man.
God
was
the
symbol
we
all
shared
the
symbol
of
all
the
mysteries
of
life
that
we
could
not
understand.
The
ancients
had
praised
God
as
a
symbol
of
our
limitless
human
potential,
but
that
ancient
symbol
had
been
lost
over
time.
Until
now.
In
that
moment,
standing
atop
the
Capitol,
with
the
warmth
of
the
sun
streaming
down
all
around
him,
Robert
Langdon
felt
a
powerful
upwelling
deep
within
himself.
It
was
an
emotion
he
had
never
felt
this
profoundly
in
his
entire
life.
