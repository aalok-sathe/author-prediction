Do
you
think
I
am
myself
a
stranger
to
myself?
What
you
tell
me
in
terms
so
qualified,
I
have
known
fully
from
a
child."
She
did
say
this
as
plainly
as
a
frank
and
flashing
glance
could,
but
in
a
moment
the
glow
of
her
complexion,
the
radiance
of
her
aspect,
had
subsided;
if
strongly
conscious
of
her
talents,
she
was
equally
conscious
of
her
harassing
defects,
and
the
remembrance
of
these
obliterated
for
a
single
second,
now
reviving
with
sudden
force,
at
once
subdued
the
too
vivid
characters
in
which
her
sense
of
her
powers
had
been
expressed.
So
quick
was
the
revulsion
of
feeling,
I
had
not
time
to
check
her
triumph
by
reproof;
ere
I
could
contract
my
brows
to
a
frown
she
had
become
serious
and
almost
mournful
looking.
"Thank
you,
sir,"
said
she,
rising.
There
was
gratitude
both
in
her
voice
and
in
the
look
with
which
she
accompanied
it.
It
was
time,
indeed,
for
our
conference
to
terminate;
for,
when
I
glanced
around,
behold
all
the
boarders
(the
day
scholars
had
departed)
were
congregated
within
a
yard
or
two
of
my
desk,
and
stood
staring
with
eyes
and
mouths
wide
open;
the
three
maitresses
formed
a
whispering
knot
in
one
corner,
and,
close
at
my
elbow,
was
the
directress,
sitting
on
a
low
chair,
calmly
clipping
the
tassels
of
her
finished
purse.
AFTER
all
I
had
profited
but
imperfectly
by
the
opportunity
I
had
so
boldly
achieved
of
speaking
to
Mdlle.
Henri;
it
was
my
intention
to
ask
her
how
she
came
to
be
possessed
of
two
English
baptismal
names,
Frances
and
Evans,
in
addition
to
her
French
surname,
also
whence
she
derived
her
good
accent.
I
had
forgotten
both
points,
or,
rather,
our
colloquy
had
been
so
brief
that
I
had
not
had
time
to
bring
them
forward;
moreover,
I
had
not
half
tested
her
powers
of
speaking
English;
all
I
had
drawn
from
her
in
that
language
were
the
words
"Yes,"
and
"Thank
you,
sir."
"No
matter,"
I
reflected.
"What
has
been
left
incomplete
now,
shall
be
finished
another
day."
Nor
did
I
fail
to
keep
the
promise
thus
made
to
myself.
It
was
difficult
to
get
even
a
few
words
of
particular
conversation
with
one
pupil
among
so
many;
but,
according
to
the
old
proverb,
"Where
there
is
a
will,
there
is
a
way;"
and
again
and
again
I
managed
to
find
an
opportunity
for
exchanging
a
few
words
with
Mdlle.
Henri,
regardless
that
envy
stared
and
detraction
whispered
whenever
I
approached
her.
"Your
book
an
instant."
Such
was
the
mode
in
which
I
often
began
these
brief
dialogues;
the
time
was
always
just
at
the
conclusion
of
the
lesson;
and
motioning
to
her
to
rise,
I
installed
myself
in
her
place,
allowing
her
to
stand
deferentially
at
my
side;
for
I
esteemed
it
wise
and
right
in
her
case
to
enforce
strictly
all
forms
ordinarily
in
use
between
master
and
pupil;
the
rather
because
I
perceived
that
in
proportion
as
my
manner
grew
austere
and
magisterial,
hers
became
easy
and
self
possessed
an
odd
contradiction,
doubtless,
to
the
ordinary
effect
in
such
cases;
but
so
it
was.
"A
pencil,"
said
I,
holding
out
my
hand
without
looking
at
her.
(I
am
now
about
to
sketch
a
brief
report
of
the
first
of
these
conferences.)
She
gave
me
one,
and
while
I
underlined
some
errors
in
a
grammatical
exercise
she
had
written,
I
observed
"You
are
not
a
native
of
Belgium?"
"No."
"Nor
of
France?"
"No."
"Where,
then,
is
your
birthplace?"
"I
was
born
at
Geneva."
"You
don't
call
Frances
and
Evans
Swiss
names,
I
presume?"
"No,
sir;
they
are
English
names."
"Just
so;
and
is
it
the
custom
of
the
Genevese
to
give
their
children
English
appellatives?"
"Non,
Monsieur;
mais
"
"Speak
English,
if
you
please."
"Mais
"
"English
"
"But"
(slowly
and
with
embarrassment)
"my
parents
were
not
all
the
two
Genevese."
"Say
BOTH,
instead
of
'all
the
two,'
mademoiselle."
"Not
BOTH
Swiss:
my
mother
was
English."
"Ah!
and
of
English
extraction?"
"Yes
her
ancestors
were
all
English."
"And
your
father?"
"He
was
Swiss."
"What
besides?
What
was
his
profession?"
"Ecclesiastic
pastor
he
had
a
church."
"Since
your
mother
is
an
Englishwoman,
why
do
you
not
speak
English
with
more
facility?"
"Maman
est
morte,
il
y
a
dix
ans."
"And
you
do
homage
to
her
memory
by
forgetting
her
language.
Have
the
goodness
to
put
French
out
of
your
mind
so
long
as
I
converse
with
you
keep
to
English."
"C'est
si
difficile,
monsieur,
quand
on
n'en
a
plus
l'habitude."
"You
had
the
habitude
formerly,
I
suppose?
Now
answer
me
in
your
mother
tongue."
"Yes,
sir,
I
spoke
the
English
more
than
the
French
when
I
was
a
child."
"Why
do
you
not
speak
it
now?"
"Because
I
have
no
English
friends."
"You
live
with
your
father,
I
suppose?"
"My
father
is
dead."
"You
have
brothers
and
sisters?"
"Not
one."
"Do
you
live
alone?"
"No
I
have
an
aunt
ma
tante
Julienne."
"Your
father's
sister?"
"Justement,
monsieur."
"Is
that
English?"
"No
but
I
forget
"
"For
which,
mademoiselle,
if
you
were
a
child
I
should
certainly
devise
some
slight
punishment;
at
your
age
you
must
be
two
or
three
and
twenty,
I
should
think?"
"Pas
encore,
monsieur
en
un
mois
j'aurai
dix
neuf
ans."
"Well,
nineteen
is
a
mature
age,
and,
having
attained
it,
you
ought
to
be
so
solicitous
for
your
own
improvement,
that
it
should
not
be
needful
for
a
master
to
remind
you
twice
of
the
expediency
of
your
speaking
English
whenever
practicable."
To
this
wise
speech
I
received
no
answer;
and,
when
I
looked
up,
my
pupil
was
smiling
to
herself
a
much
meaning,
though
not
very
gay
smile;
it
seemed
to
say,
"He
talks
of
he
knows
not
what:"
it
said
this
so
plainly,
that
I
determined
to
request
information
on
the
point
concerning
which
my
ignorance
seemed
to
be
thus
tacitly
affirmed.
"Are
you
solicitous
for
your
own
improvement?"
"Rather."
"How
do
you
prove
it,
mademoiselle?"
An
odd
question,
and
bluntly
put;
it
excited
a
second
smile.
"Why,
monsieur,
I
am
not
inattentive
am
I?
I
learn
my
lessons
well
"
"Oh,
a
child
can
do
that!
and
what
more
do
you
do?"
"What
more
can
I
do?"
"Oh,
certainly,
not
much;
but
you
are
a
teacher,
are
you
not,
as
well
as
a
pupil?"
"Yes."
"You
teach
lace
mending?"
"Yes."
"A
dull,
stupid
occupation;
do
you
like
it?"
"No
it
is
tedious."
"Why
do
you
pursue
it?
Why
do
you
not
rather
teach
history,
geography,
grammar,
even
arithmetic?"
"Is
monsieur
certain
that
I
am
myself
thoroughly
acquainted
with
these
studies?"
"I
don't
know;
you
ought
to
be
at
your
age."
"But
I
never
was
at
school,
monsieur
"
"Indeed!
What
then
were
your
friends
what
was
your
aunt
about?
She
is
very
much
to
blame."
"No
monsieur,
no
my
aunt
is
good
she
is
not
to
blame
she
does
what
she
can;
she
lodges
and
nourishes
me"
(I
report
Mdlle.
Henri's
phrases
literally,
and
it
was
thus
she
translated
from
the
French).
"She
is
not
rich;
she
has
only
an
annuity
of
twelve
hundred
francs,
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
send
me
to
school."
"Rather,"
thought
I
to
myself
on
hearing
this,
but
I
continued,
in
the
dogmatical
tone
I
had
adopted:
"It
is
sad,
however,
that
you
should
be
brought
up
in
ignorance
of
the
most
ordinary
branches
of
education;
had
you
known
something
of
history
and
grammar
you
might,
by
degrees,
have
relinquished
your
lace
mending
drudgery,
and
risen
in
the
world."
"It
is
what
I
mean
to
do."
"How?
By
a
knowledge
of
English
alone?
That
will
not
suffice;
no
respectable
family
will
receive
a
governess
whose
whole
stock
of
knowledge
consists
in
a
familiarity
with
one
foreign
language."
"Monsieur,
I
know
other
things."
"Yes,
yes,
you
can
work
with
Berlin
wools,
and
embroider
handkerchiefs
and
collars
that
will
do
little
for
you."
Mdlle.
Henri's
lips
were
unclosed
to
answer,
but
she
checked
herself,
as
thinking
the
discussion
had
been
sufficiently
pursued,
and
remained
silent.
"Speak,"
I
continued,
impatiently;
"I
never
like
the
appearance
of
acquiescence
when
the
reality
is
not
there;
and
you
had
a
contradiction
at
your
tongue's
end."
"Monsieur,
I
have
had
many
lessons
both
in
grammar,
history,
geography,
and
arithmetic.
I
have
gone
through
a
course
of
each
study."
"Bravo!
but
how
did
you
manage
it,
since
your
aunt
could
not
afford
to
send
you
to
school?"
"By
lace
mending;
by
the
thing
monsieur
despises
so
much."
"Truly!
And
now,
mademoiselle,
it
will
be
a
good
exercise
for
you
to
explain
to
me
in
English
how
such
a
result
was
produced
by
such
means."
"Monsieur,
I
begged
my
aunt
to
have
me
taught
lace
mending
soon
after
we
came
to
Brussels,
because
I
knew
it
was
a
METIER,
a
trade
which
was
easily
learnt,
and
by
which
I
could
earn
some
money
very
soon.
I
learnt
it
in
a
few
days,
and
I
quickly
got
work,
for
all
the
Brussels
ladies
have
old
lace
very
precious
which
must
be
mended
all
the
times
it
is
washed.
I
earned
money
a
little,
and
this
money
I
grave
for
lessons
in
the
studies
I
have
mentioned;
some
of
it
I
spent
in
buying
books,
English
books
especially;
soon
I
shall
try
to
find
a
place
of
governess,
or
school
teacher,
when
I
can
write
and
speak
English
well;
but
it
will
be
difficult,
because
those
who
know
I
have
been
a
lace
mender
will
despise
me,
as
the
pupils
here
despise
me.
Pourtant
j'ai
mon
projet,"
she
added
in
a
lower
tone.
"What
is
it?"
"I
will
go
and
live
in
England;
I
will
teach
French
there."
The
words
were
pronounced
emphatically.
She
said
"England"
as
you
might
suppose
an
Israelite
of
Moses'
days
would
have
said
Canaan.
"Have
you
a
wish
to
see
England?"
"Yes,
and
an
intention."
And
here
a
voice,
the
voice
of
the
directress,
interposed:
"Mademoiselle
Henri,
je
crois
qu'il
va
pleuvoir;
vous
feriez
bien,
ma
bonne
amie,
de
retourner
chez
vous
tout
de
suite."
In
silence,
without
a
word
of
thanks
for
this
officious
warning,
Mdlle.
Henri
collected
her
books;
she
moved
to
me
respectfully,
endeavoured
to
move
to
her
superior,
though
the
endeavour
was
almost
a
failure,
for
her
head
seemed
as
if
it
would
not
bend,
and
thus
departed.
Where
there
is
one
grain
of
perseverance
or
wilfulness
in
the
composition,
trifling
obstacles
are
ever
known
rather
to
stimulate
than
discourage.
Mdlle.
Reuter
might
as
well
have
spared
herself
the
trouble
of
giving
that
intimation
about
the
weather
(by
the
by
her
prediction
was
falsified
by
the
event
it
did
not
rain
that
evening).
At
the
close
of
the
next
lesson
I
was
again
at
Mdlle.
Henri's
desk.
Thus
did
I
accost
her:
"What
is
your
idea
of
England,
mademoiselle?
Why
do
you
wish
to
go
there?"
Accustomed
by
this
time
to
the
calculated
abruptness
of
my
manner,
it
no
longer
discomposed
or
surprised
her,
and
she
answered
with
only
so
much
of
hesitation
as
was
rendered
inevitable
by
the
difficulty
she
experienced
in
improvising
the
translation
of
her
thoughts
from
French
to
English.
"England
is
something
unique,
as
I
have
heard
and
read;
my
idea
of
it
is
vague,
and
I
want
to
go
there
to
render
my
idea
clear,
definite."
"Hum!
How
much
of
England
do
you
suppose
you
could
see
if
you
went
there
in
the
capacity
of
a
teacher?
A
strange
notion
you
must
have
of
getting
a
clear
and
definite
idea
of
a
country!
All
you
could
see
of
Great
Britain
would
be
the
interior
of
a
school,
or
at
most
of
one
or
two
private
dwellings."
"It
would
be
an
English
school;
they
would
be
English
dwellings."
"Indisputably;
but
what
then?
What
would
be
the
value
of
observations
made
on
a
scale
so
narrow?"
"Monsieur,
might
not
one
learn
something
by
analogy?
An
echantillon
a
a
sample
often
serves
to
give
an
idea
of
the
whole;
besides,
narrow
and
wide
are
words
comparative,
are
they
not?
All
my
life
would
perhaps
seem
narrow
in
your
eyes
all
the
life
of
a
that
little
animal
subterranean
une
taupe
comment
dit
on?"
"Mole."
"Yes
a
mole,
which
lives
underground
would
seem
narrow
even
to
me."
"Well,
mademoiselle
what
then?
Proceed."
"Mais,
monsieur,
vous
me
comprenez."
"Not
in
the
least;
have
the
goodness
to
explain."
"Why,
monsieur,
it
is
just
so.
In
Switzerland
I
have
done
but
little,
learnt
but
little,
and
seen
but
little;
my
life
there
was
in
a
circle;
I
walked
the
same
round
every
day;
I
could
not
get
out
of
it;
had
I
rested
remained
there
even
till
my
death,
I
should
never
have
enlarged
it,
because
I
am
poor
and
not
skilful,
I
have
not
great
acquirements;
when
I
was
quite
tired
of
this
round,
I
begged
my
aunt
to
go
to
Brussels;
my
existence
is
no
larger
here,
because
I
am
no
richer
or
higher;
I
walk
in
as
narrow
a
limit,
but
the
scene
is
changed;
it
would
change
again
if
I
went
to
England.
I
knew
something
of
the
bourgeois
of
Geneva,
now
I
know
something
of
the
bourgeois
of
Brussels;
if
I
went
to
London,
I
would
know
something
of
the
bourgeois
of
London.
Can
you
make
any
sense
out
of
what
I
say,
monsieur,
or
is
it
all
obscure?"
"I
see,
I
see
now
let
us
advert
to
another
subject;
you
propose
to
devote
your
life
to
teaching,
and
you
are
a
most
unsuccessful
teacher;
you
cannot
keep
your
pupils
in
order."
A
flush
of
painful
confusion
was
the
result
of
this
harsh
remark;
she
bent
her
head
to
the
desk,
but
soon
raising
it
replied
"Monsieur,
I
am
not
a
skilful
teacher,
it
is
true,
but
practice
improves;
besides,
I
work
under
difficulties;
here
I
only
teach
sewing,
I
can
show
no
power
in
sewing,
no
superiority
it
is
a
subordinate
art;
then
I
have
no
associates
in
this
house,
I
am
isolated;
I
am
too
a
heretic,
which
deprives
me
of
influence."
"And
in
England
you
would
be
a
foreigner;
that
too
would
deprive
you
of
influence,
and
would
effectually
separate
you
from
all
round
you;
in
England
you
would
have
as
few
connections,
as
little
importance
as
you
have
here."
"But
I
should
be
learning
something;
for
the
rest,
there
are
probably
difficulties
for
such
as
I
everywhere,
and
if
I
must
contend,
and
perhaps
be
conquered,
I
would
rather
submit
to
English
pride
than
to
Flemish
coarseness;
besides,
monsieur
"
She
stopped
not
evidently
from
any
difficulty
in
finding
words
to
express
herself,
but
because
discretion
seemed
to
say,
"You
have
said
enough."
"Finish
your
phrase,"
I
urged.
"Besides,
monsieur,
I
long
to
live
once
more
among
Protestants;
they
are
more
honest
than
Catholics;
a
Romish
school
is
a
building
with
porous
walls,
a
hollow
floor,
a
false
ceiling;
every
room
in
this
house,
monsieur,
has
eyeholes
and
ear
holes,
and
what
the
house
is,
the
inhabitants
are,
very
treacherous;
they
all
think
it
lawful
to
tell
lies;
they
all
call
it
politeness
to
profess
friendship
where
they
feel
hatred."
"All?"
said
I;
"you
mean
the
pupils
the
mere
children
inexperienced,
giddy
things,
who
have
not
learnt
to
distinguish
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong?"
"On
the
contrary,
monsieur
the
children
are
the
most
sincere;
they
have
not
yet
had
time
to
become
accomplished
in
duplicity;
they
will
tell
lies,
but
they
do
it
inartificially,
and
you
know
they
are
lying;
but
the
grown
up
people
are
very
false;
they
deceive
strangers,
they
deceive
each
other
"
A
servant
here
entered:
"Mdlle.
Henri
Mdlle.
Reuter
vous
prie
de
vouloir
bien
conduire
la
petite
de
Dorlodot
chez
elle,
elle
vous
attend
dans
le
cabinet
de
Rosalie
la
portiere
c'est
que
sa
bonne
n'est
pas
venue
la
chercher
voyez
vous."
"Eh
bien!
est
ce
que
je
suis
sa
bonne
moi?"
demanded
Mdlle.
Henri;
then
smiling,
with
that
same
bitter,
derisive
smile
I
had
seen
on
her
lips
once
before,
she
hastily
rose
and
made
her
exit.
THE
young
Anglo
Swiss
evidently
derived
both
pleasure
and
profit
from
the
study
of
her
mother
tongue.
In
teaching
her
I
did
not,
of
course,
confine
myself
to
the
ordinary
school
routine;
I
made
instruction
in
English
a
channel
for
instruction
in
literature.
I
prescribed
to
her
a
course
of
reading;
she
had
a
little
selection
of
English
classics,
a
few
of
which
had
been
left
her
by
her
mother,
and
the
others
she
had
purchased
with
her
own
penny
fee.
I
lent
her
some
more
modern
works;
all
these
she
read
with
avidity,
giving
me,
in
writing,
a
clear
summary
of
each
work
when
she
had
perused
it.
Composition,
too,
she
delighted
in.
Such
occupation
seemed
the
very
breath
of
her
nostrils,
and
soon
her
improved
productions
wrung
from
me
the
avowal
that
those
qualities
in
her
I
had
termed
taste
and
fancy
ought
rather
to
have
been
denominated
judgment
and
imagination.
When
I
intimated
so
much,
which
I
did
as
usual
in
dry
and
stinted
phrase,
I
looked
for
the
radiant
and
exulting
smile
my
one
word
of
eulogy
had
elicited
before;
but
Frances
coloured.
If
she
did
smile,
it
was
very
softly
and
shyly;
and
instead
of
looking
up
to
me
with
a
conquering
glance,
her
eyes
rested
on
my
hand,
which,
stretched
over
her
shoulder,
was
writing
some
directions
with
a
pencil
on
the
margin
of
her
book.
"Well,
are
you
pleased
that
I
am
satisfied
with
your
progress?"
I
asked.
"Yes,"
said
she
slowly,
gently,
the
blush
that
had
half
subsided
returning.
"But
I
do
not
say
enough,
I
suppose?"
I
continued.
"My
praises
are
too
cool?"
She
made
no
answer,
and,
I
thought,
looked
a
little
sad.
I
divined
her
thoughts,
and
should
much
have
liked
to
have
responded
to
them,
had
it
been
expedient
so
to
do.
She
was
not
now
very
ambitious
of
my
admiration
not
eagerly
desirous
of
dazzling
me;
a
little
affection
ever
so
little
pleased
her
better
than
all
the
panegyrics
in
the
world.
Feeling
this,
I
stood
a
good
while
behind
her,
writing
on
the
margin
of
her
book.
I
could
hardly
quit
my
station
or
relinquish
my
occupation;
something
retained
me
bending
there,
my
head
very
near
hers,
and
my
hand
near
hers
too;
but
the
margin
of
a
copy
book
is
not
an
illimitable
space
so,
doubtless,
the
directress
thought;
and
she
took
occasion
to
walk
past
in
order
to
ascertain
by
what
art
I
prolonged
so
disproportionately
the
period
necessary
for
filling
it.
I
was
obliged
to
go.
Distasteful
effort
to
leave
what
we
most
prefer!
Frances
did
not
become
pale
or
feeble
in
consequence
of
her
sedentary
employment;
perhaps
the
stimulus
it
communicated
to
her
mind
counterbalanced
the
inaction
it
imposed
on
her
body.
She
changed,
indeed,
changed
obviously
and
rapidly;
but
it
was
for
the
better.
When
I
first
saw
her,
her
countenance
was
sunless,
her
complexion
colourless;
she
looked
like
one
who
had
no
source
of
enjoyment,
no
store
of
bliss
anywhere
in
the
world;
now
the
cloud
had
passed
from
her
mien,
leaving
space
for
the
dawn
of
hope
and
interest,
and
those
feelings
rose
like
a
clear
morning,
animating
what
had
been
depressed,
tinting
what
had
been
pale.
Her
eyes,
whose
colour
I
had
not
at
first
known,
so
dim
were
they
with
repressed
tears,
so
shadowed
with
ceaseless
dejection,
now,
lit
by
a
ray
of
the
sunshine
that
cheered
her
heart,
revealed
irids
of
bright
hazel
irids
large
and
full,
screened
with
long
lashes;
and
pupils
instinct
with
fire.
That
look
of
wan
emaciation
which
anxiety
or
low
spirits
often
communicates
to
a
thoughtful,
thin
face,
rather
long
than
round,
having
vanished
from
hers,
a
clearness
of
skin
almost
bloom,
and
a
plumpness
almost
embonpoint,
softened
the
decided
lines
of
her
features.
Her
figure
shared
in
this
beneficial
change;
it
became
rounder,
and
as
the
harmony
of
her
form
was
complete
and
her
stature
of
the
graceful
middle
height,
one
did
not
regret
(or
at
least
I
did
not
regret)
the
absence
of
confirmed
fulness,
in
contours,
still
slight,
though
compact,
elegant,
flexible
the
exquisite
turning
of
waist,
wrist,
hand,
foot,
and
ankle
satisfied
completely
my
notions
of
symmetry,
and
allowed
a
lightness
and
freedom
of
movement
which
corresponded
with
my
ideas
of
grace.
Thus
improved,
thus
wakened
to
life,
Mdlle.
Henri
began
to
take
a
new
footing
in
the
school;
her
mental
power,
manifested
gradually
but
steadily,
ere
long
extorted
recognition
even
from
the
envious;
and
when
the
young
and
healthy
saw
that
she
could
smile
brightly,
converse
gaily,
move
with
vivacity
and
alertness,
they
acknowledged
in
her
a
sisterhood
of
youth
and
health,
and
tolerated
her
as
of
their
kind
accordingly.
To
speak
truth,
I
watched
this
change
much
as
a
gardener
watches
the
growth
of
a
precious
plant,
and
I
contributed
to
it
too,
even
as
the
said
gardener
contributes
to
the
development
of
his
favourite.
To
me
it
was
not
difficult
to
discover
how
I
could
best
foster
my
pupil,
cherish
her
starved
feelings,
and
induce
the
outward
manifestation
of
that
inward
vigour
which
sunless
drought
and
blighting
blast
had
hitherto
forbidden
to
expand.
Constancy
of
attention
a
kindness
as
mute
as
watchful,
always
standing
by
her,
cloaked
in
the
rough
garb
of
austerity,
and
making
its
real
nature
known
only
by
a
rare
glance
of
interest,
or
a
cordial
and
gentle
word;
real
respect
masked
with
seeming
imperiousness,
directing,
urging
her
actions,
yet
helping
her
too,
and
that
with
devoted
care:
these
were
the
means
I
used,
for
these
means
best
suited
Frances'
feelings,
as
susceptible
as
deep
vibrating
her
nature
at
once
proud
and
shy.
The
benefits
of
my
system
became
apparent
also
in
her
altered
demeanour
as
a
teacher;
she
now
took
her
place
amongst
her
pupils
with
an
air
of
spirit
and
firmness
which
assured
them
at
once
that
she
meant
to
be
obeyed
and
obeyed
she
was.
They
felt
they
had
lost
their
power
over
her.
If
any
girl
had
rebelled,
she
would
no
longer
have
taken
her
rebellion
to
heart;
she
possessed
a
source
of
comfort
they
could
not
drain,
a
pillar
of
support
they
could
not
overthrow:
formerly,
when
insulted,
she
wept;
now,
she
smiled.
The
public
reading
of
one
of
her
devoirs
achieved
the
revelation
of
her
talents
to
all
and
sundry;
I
remember
the
subject
it
was
an
emigrant's
letter
to
his
friends
at
home.
It
opened
with
simplicity;
some
natural
and
graphic
touches
disclosed
to
the
reader
the
scene
of
virgin
forest
and
great,
New
World
river
barren
of
sail
and
flag
amidst
which
the
epistle
was
supposed
to
be
indited.
The
difficulties
and
dangers
that
attend
a
settler's
life,
were
hinted
at;
and
in
the
few
words
said
on
that
subject,
Mdlle.
Henri
failed
not
to
render
audible
the
voice
of
resolve,
patience,
endeavour.
The
disasters
which
had
driven
him
from
his
native
country
were
alluded
to;
stainless
honour,
inflexible
independence,
indestructible
self
respect
there
took
the
word.
Past
days
were
spoken
of;
the
grief
of
parting,
the
regrets
of
absence,
were
touched
upon;
feeling,
forcible
and
fine,
breathed
eloquent
in
every
period.
At
the
close,
consolation
was
suggested;
religious
faith
became
there
the
speaker,
and
she
spoke
well.
The
devoir
was
powerfully
written
in
language
at
once
chaste
and
choice,
in
a
style
nerved
with
vigour
and
graced
with
harmony.
Mdlle.
Reuter
was
quite
sufficiently
acquainted
with
English
to
understand
it
when
read
or
spoken
in
her
presence,
though
she
could
neither
speak
nor
write
it
herself.
During
the
perusal
of
this
devoir,
she
sat
placidly
busy,
her
eyes
and
fingers
occupied
with
the
formation
of
a
"riviere"
or
open
work
hem
round
a
cambric
handkerchief;
she
said
nothing,
and
her
face
and
forehead,
clothed
with
a
mask
of
purely
negative
expression,
were
as
blank
of
comment
as
her
lips.
As
neither
surprise,
pleasure,
approbation,
nor
interest
were
evinced
in
her
countenance,
so
no
more
were
disdain,
envy,
annoyance,
weariness;
if
that
inscrutable
mien
said
anything,
it
was
simply
this
"The
matter
is
too
trite
to
excite
an
emotion,
or
call
forth
an
opinion."
As
soon
as
I
had
done,
a
hum
rose;
several
of
the
pupils,
pressing
round
Mdlle.
Henri,
began
to
beset
her
with
compliments;
the
composed
voice
of
the
directress
was
now
heard:
"Young
ladies,
such
of
you
as
have
cloaks
and
umbrellas
will
hasten
to
return
home
before
the
shower
becomes
heavier"
(it
was
raining
a
little),
"the
remainder
will
wait
till
their
respective
servants
arrive
to
fetch
them."
And
the
school
dispersed,
for
it
was
four
o'clock.
"Monsieur,
a
word,"
said
Mdlle.
Reuter,
stepping
on
to
the
estrade,
and
signifying,
by
a
movement
of
the
hand,
that
she
wished
me
to
relinquish,
for
an
instant,
the
castor
I
had
clutched.
"Mademoiselle,
I
am
at
your
service."
"Monsieur,
it
is
of
course
an
excellent
plan
to
encourage
effort
in
young
people
by
making
conspicuous
the
progress
of
any
particularly
industrious
pupil;
but
do
you
not
think
that
in
the
present
instance,
Mdlle.
Henri
can
hardly
be
considered
as
a
concurrent
with
the
other
pupils?
She
is
older
than
most
of
them,
and
has
had
advantages
of
an
exclusive
nature
for
acquiring
a
knowledge
of
English;
on
the
other
hand,
her
sphere
of
life
is
somewhat
beneath
theirs;
under
these
circumstances,
a
public
distinction,
conferred
upon
Mdlle.
Henri,
may
be
the
means
of
suggesting
comparisons,
and
exciting
feelings
such
as
would
be
far
from
advantageous
to
the
individual
forming
their
object.
The
interest
I
take
in
Mdlle.
Henri's
real
welfare
makes
me
desirous
of
screening
her
from
annoyances
of
this
sort;
besides,
monsieur,
as
I
have
before
hinted
to
you,
the
sentiment
of
AMOUR
PROPRE
has
a
somewhat
marked
preponderance
in
her
character;
celebrity
has
a
tendency
to
foster
this
sentiment,
and
in
her
it
should
be
rather
repressed
she
rather
needs
keeping
down
than
bringing
forward;
and
then
I
think,
monsieur
it
appears
to
me
that
ambition,
LITERARY
ambition
especially,
is
not
a
feeling
to
be
cherished
in
the
mind
of
a
woman:
would
not
Mdlle.
Henri
be
much
safer
and
happier
if
taught
to
believe
that
in
the
quiet
discharge
of
social
duties
consists
her
real
vocation,
than
if
stimulated
to
aspire
after
applause
and
publicity?
She
may
never
marry;
scanty
as
are
her
resources,
obscure
as
are
her
connections,
uncertain
as
is
her
health
(for
I
think
her
consumptive,
her
mother
died
of
that
complaint),
it
is
more
than
probable
she
never
will.
I
do
not
see
how
she
can
rise
to
a
position,
whence
such
a
step
would
be
possible;
but
even
in
celibacy
it
would
be
better
for
her
to
retain
the
character
and
habits
of
a
respectable
decorous
female."
"Indisputably,
mademoiselle,"
was
my
answer.
"Your
opinion
admits
of
no
doubt;"
and,
fearful
of
the
harangue
being
renewed,
I
retreated
under
cover
of
that
cordial
sentence
of
assent.
At
the
date
of
a
fortnight
after
the
little
incident
noted
above,
I
find
it
recorded
in
my
diary
that
a
hiatus
occurred
in
Mdlle.
Henri's
usually
regular
attendance
in
class.
The
first
day
or
two
I
wondered
at
her
absence,
but
did
not
like
to
ask
an
explanation
of
it;
I
thought
indeed
some
chance
word
might
be
dropped
which
would
afford
me
the
information
I
wished
to
obtain,
without
my
running
the
risk
of
exciting
silly
smiles
and
gossiping
whispers
by
demanding
it.
But
when
a
week
passed
and
the
seat
at
the
desk
near
the
door
still
remained
vacant,
and
when
no
allusion
was
made
to
the
circumstance
by
any
individual
of
the
class
when,
on
the
contrary,
I
found
that
all
observed
a
marked
silence
on
the
point
I
determined,
COUTE
QUI
COUTE,
to
break
the
ice
of
this
silly
reserve.
I
selected
Sylvie
as
my
informant,
because
from
her
I
knew
that
I
should
at
least
get
a
sensible
answer,
unaccompanied
by
wriggle,
titter,
or
other
flourish
of
folly.
"Ou
donc
est
Mdlle.
Henri?"
I
said
one
day
as
I
returned
an
exercise
book
I
had
been
examining.
"Elle
est
partie,
monsieur."
"Partie?
et
pour
combien
de
temps?
Quand
reviendra
t
elle?"
"Elle
est
partie
pour
toujours,
monsieur;
elle
ne
reviendra
plus."
"Ah!"
was
my
involuntary
exclamation;
then
after
a
pause:
"En
etes
vous
bien
sure,
Sylvie?"
"Oui,
oui,
monsieur,
mademoiselle
la
directrice
nous
l'a
dit
elle
meme
il
y
a
deux
ou
trois
jours."
And
I
could
pursue
my
inquiries
no
further;
time,
place,
and
circumstances
forbade
my
adding
another
word.
I
could
neither
comment
on
what
had
been
said,
nor
demand
further
particulars.
A
question
as
to
the
reason
of
the
teacher's
departure,
as
to
whether
it
had
been
voluntary
or
otherwise,
was
indeed
on
my
lips,
but
I
suppressed
it
there
were
listeners
all
round.
An
hour
after,
in
passing
Sylvie
in
the
corridor
as
she
was
putting
on
her
bonnet,
I
stopped
short
and
asked:
"Sylvie,
do
you
know
Mdlle.
Henri's
address?
I
have
some
books
of
hers,"
I
added
carelessly,
"and
I
should
wish
to
send
them
to
her."
"No,
monsieur,"
replied
Sylvie;
"but
perhaps
Rosalie,
the
portress,
will
be
able
to
give
it
you."
Rosalie's
cabinet
was
just
at
hand;
I
stepped
in
and
repeated
the
inquiry.
Rosalie
a
smart
French
grisette
looked
up
from
her
work
with
a
knowing
smile,
precisely
the
sort
of
smile
I
had
been
so
desirous
to
avoid
exciting.
Her
answer
was
prepared;
she
knew
nothing
whatever
of
Mdlle.
Henri's
address
had
never
known
it.
Turning
from
her
with
impatience
for
I
believed
she
lied
and
was
hired
to
lie
I
almost
knocked
down
some
one
who
had
been
standing
at
my
back;
it
was
the
directress.
My
abrupt
movement
made
her
recoil
two
or
three
steps.
I
was
obliged
to
apologize,
which
I
did
more
concisely
than
politely.
No
man
likes
to
be
dogged,
and
in
the
very
irritable
mood
in
which
I
then
was
the
sight
of
Mdlle.
Reuter
thoroughly
incensed
me.
At
the
moment
I
turned
her
countenance
looked
hard,
dark,
and
inquisitive;
her
eyes
were
bent
upon
me
with
an
expression
of
almost
hungry
curiosity.
I
had
scarcely
caught
this
phase
of
physiognomy
ere
it
had
vanished;
a
bland
smile
played
on
her
features;
my
harsh
apology
was
received
with
good
humoured
facility.
"Oh,
don't
mention
it,
monsieur;
you
only
touched
my
hair
with
your
elbow;
it
is
no
worse,
only
a
little
dishevelled."
She
shook
it
back,
and
passing
her
fingers
through
her
curls,
loosened
them
into
more
numerous
and
flowing
ringlets.
Then
she
went
on
with
vivacity:
"Rosalie,
I
was
coming
to
tell
you
to
go
instantly
and
close
the
windows
of
the
salon;
the
wind
is
rising,
and
the
muslin
curtains
will
be
covered
with
dust."
Rosalie
departed.
"Now,"
thought
I,
"this
will
not
do;
Mdlle.
Reuter
thinks
her
meanness
in
eaves
dropping
is
screened
by
her
art
in
devising
a
pretext,
whereas
the
muslin
curtains
she
speaks
of
are
not
more
transparent
than
this
same
pretext."
An
impulse
came
over
me
to
thrust
the
flimsy
screen
aside,
and
confront
her
craft
boldly
with
a
word
or
two
of
plain
truth.
"The
rough
shod
foot
treads
most
firmly
on
slippery
ground,"
thought
I;
so
I
began:
"Mademoiselle
Henri
has
left
your
establishment
been
dismissed,
I
presume?"
"Ah,
I
wished
to
have
a
little
conversation
with
you,
monsieur,"
replied
the
directress
with
the
most
natural
and
affable
air
in
the
world;
"but
we
cannot
talk
quietly
here;
will
Monsieur
step
into
the
garden
a
minute?"
And
she
preceded
me,
stepping
out
through
the
glass
door
I
have
before
mentioned.
"There,"
said
she,
when
we
had
reached
the
centre
of
the
middle
alley,
and
when
the
foliage
of
shrubs
and
trees,
now
in
their
summer
pride,
closing
behind
end
around
us,
shut
out
the
view
of
the
house,
and
thus
imparted
a
sense
of
seclusion
even
to
this
little
plot
of
ground
in
the
very
core
of
a
capital.
"There,
one
feels
quiet
and
free
when
there
are
only
pear
trees
and
rose
bushes
about
one;
I
dare
say
you,
like
me,
monsieur,
are
sometimes
tired
of
being
eternally
in
the
midst
of
life;
of
having
human
faces
always
round
you,
human
eyes
always
upon
you,
human
voices
always
in
your
ear.
I
am
sure
I
often
wish
intensely
for
liberty
to
spend
a
whole
month
in
the
country
at
some
little
farm
house,
bien
gentille,
bien
propre,
tout
entouree
de
champs
et
de
bois;
quelle
vie
charmante
que
la
vie
champetre!
N'est
ce
pas,
monsieur?"
"Cela
depend,
mademoiselle."
"Que
le
vent
est
bon
et
frais!"
continued
the
directress;
and
she
was
right
there,
for
it
was
a
south
wind,
soft
and
sweet.
I
carried
my
hat
in
my
hand,
and
this
gentle
breeze,
passing
through
my
hair,
soothed
my
temples
like
balm.
Its
refreshing
effect,
however,
penetrated
no
deeper
than
the
mere
surface
of
the
frame;
for
as
I
walked
by
the
side
of
Mdlle.
Reuter,
my
heart
was
still
hot
within
me,
and
while
I
was
musing
the
fire
burned;
then
spake
I
with
my
tongue:
"I
understand
Mdlle.
Henri
is
gone
from
hence,
and
will
not
return?"
"Ah,
true!
I
meant
to
have
named
the
subject
to
you
some
days
ago,
but
my
time
is
so
completely
taken
up,
I
cannot
do
half
the
things
I
wish:
have
you
never
experienced
what
it
is,
monsieur,
to
find
the
day
too
short
by
twelve
hours
for
your
numerous
duties?"
"Not
often.
Mdlle.
Henri's
departure
was
not
voluntary,
I
presume?
If
it
had
been,
she
would
certainly
have
given
me
some
intimation
of
it,
being
my
pupil."
"Oh,
did
she
not
tell
you?
that
was
strange;
for
my
part,
I
never
thought
of
adverting
to
the
subject;
when
one
has
so
many
things
to
attend
to,
one
is
apt
to
forget
little
incidents
that
are
not
of
primary
importance."
"You
consider
Mdlle.
Henri's
dismission,
then,
as
a
very
insignificant
event?"
"Dismission?
Ah!
she
was
not
dismissed;
I
can
say
with
truth,
monsieur,
that
since
I
became
the
head
of
this
establishment
no
master
or
teacher
has
ever
been
dismissed
from
it."
"Yet
some
have
left
it,
mademoiselle?"
"Many;
I
have
found
it
necessary
to
change
frequently
a
change
of
instructors
is
often
beneficial
to
the
interests
of
a
school;
it
gives
life
and
variety
to
the
proceedings;
it
amuses
the
pupils,
and
suggests
to
the
parents
the
idea
of
exertion
and
progress."
"Yet
when
you
are
tired
of
a
professor
or
maitresse,
you
scruple
to
dismiss
them?"
"No
need
to
have
recourse
to
such
extreme
measures,
I
assure
you.
Allons,
monsieur
le
professeur
asseyons
nous;
je
vais
vous
donner
une
petite
lecon
dans
votre
etat
d'instituteur."
(I
wish
I
might
write
all
she
said
to
me
in
French
it
loses
sadly
by
being
translated
into
English.)
We
had
now
reached
THE
garden
chair;
the
directress
sat
down,
and
signed
to
me
to
sit
by
her,
but
I
only
rested
my
knee
on
the
seat,
and
stood
leaning
my
head
and
arm
against
the
embowering
branch
of
a
huge
laburnum,
whose
golden
flowers,
blent
with
the
dusky
green
leaves
of
a
lilac
bush,
formed
a
mixed
arch
of
shade
and
sunshine
over
the
retreat.
Mdlle.
Reuter
sat
silent
a
moment;
some
novel
movements
were
evidently
working
in
her
mind,
and
they
showed
their
nature
on
her
astute
brow;
she
was
meditating
some
CHEF
D'OEUVRE
of
policy.
Convinced
by
several
months'
experience
that
the
affectation
of
virtues
she
did
not
possess
was
unavailing
to
ensnare
me
aware
that
I
had
read
her
real
nature,
and
would
believe
nothing
of
the
character
she
gave
out
as
being
hers
she
had
determined,
at
last,
to
try
a
new
key,
and
see
if
the
lock
of
my
heart
would
yield
to
that;
a
little
audacity,
a
word
of
truth,
a
glimpse
of
the
real.
"Yes,
I
will
try,"
was
her
inward
resolve;
and
then
her
blue
eye
glittered
upon
me
it
did
not
flash
nothing
of
flame
ever
kindled
in
its
temperate
gleam.
"Monsieur
fears
to
sit
by
me?"
she
inquired
playfully.
"I
have
no
wish
to
usurp
Pelet's
place,"
I
answered,
for
I
had
got
the
habit
of
speaking
to
her
bluntly
a
habit
begun
in
anger,
but
continued
because
I
saw
that,
instead
of
offending,
it
fascinated
her.
She
cast
down
her
eyes,
and
drooped
her
eyelids;
she
sighed
uneasily;
she
turned
with
an
anxious
gesture,
as
if
she
would
give
me
the
idea
of
a
bird
that
flutters
in
its
cage,
and
would
fain
fly
from
its
jail
and
jailer,
and
seek
its
natural
mate
and
pleasant
nest.
"Well
and
your
lesson?"
I
demanded
briefly.
"Ah!"
she
exclaimed,
recovering
herself,
"you
are
so
young,
so
frank
and
fearless,
so
talented,
so
impatient
of
imbecility,
so
disdainful
of
vulgarity,
you
need
a
lesson;
here
it
is
then:
far
more
is
to
be
done
in
this
world
by
dexterity
than
by
strength;
but,
perhaps,
you
knew
that
before,
for
there
is
delicacy
as
well
as
power
in
your
character
policy,
as
well
as
pride?"
"Go
on,"
said
I;
and
I
could
hardly
help
smiling,
the
flattery
was
so
piquant,
so
finely
seasoned.
She
caught
the
prohibited
smile,
though
I
passed
my
hand
over
my
month
to
conceal
it;
and
again
she
made
room
for
me
to
sit
beside
her.
I
shook
my
head,
though
temptation
penetrated
to
my
senses
at
the
moment,
and
once
more
I
told
her
to
go
on.
"Well,
then,
if
ever
you
are
at
the
head
of
a
large
establishment,
dismiss
nobody.
To
speak
truth,
monsieur
(and
to
you
I
will
speak
truth),
I
despise
people
who
are
always
making
rows,
blustering,
sending
off
one
to
the
right,
and
another
to
the
left,
urging
and
hurrying
circumstances.
I'll
tell
you
what
I
like
best
to
do,
monsieur,
shall
I?"
She
looked
up
again;
she
had
compounded
her
glance
well
this
time
much
archness,
more
deference,
a
spicy
dash
of
coquetry,
an
unveiled
consciousness
of
capacity.
I
nodded;
she
treated
me
like
the
great
Mogul;
so
I
became
the
great
Mogul
as
far
as
she
was
concerned.
"I
like,
monsieur,
to
take
my
knitting
in
my
hands,
and
to
sit
quietly
down
in
my
chair;
circumstances
defile
past
me;
I
watch
their
march;
so
long
as
they
follow
the
course
I
wish,
I
say
nothing,
and
do
nothing;
I
don't
clap
my
hands,
and
cry
out
'Bravo!
How
lucky
I
am!'
to
attract
the
attention
and
envy
of
my
neighbours
I
am
merely
passive;
but
when
events
fall
out
ill
when
circumstances
become
adverse
I
watch
very
vigilantly;
I
knit
on
still,
and
still
I
hold
my
tongue;
but
every
now
and
then,
monsieur,
I
just
put
my
toe
out
so
and
give
the
rebellious
circumstance
a
little
secret
push,
without
noise,
which
sends
it
the
way
I
wish,
and
I
am
successful
after
all,
and
nobody
has
seen
my
expedient.
So,
when
teachers
or
masters
become
troublesome
and
inefficient
when,
in
short,
the
interests
of
the
school
would
suffer
from
their
retaining
their
places
I
mind
my
knitting,
events
progress,
circumstances
glide
past;
I
see
one
which,
if
pushed
ever
so
little
awry,
will
render
untenable
the
post
I
wish
to
have
vacated
the
deed
is
done
the
stumbling
block
removed
and
no
one
saw
me:
I
have
not
made
an
enemy,
I
am
rid
of
an
incumbrance."
A
moment
since,
and
I
thought
her
alluring;
this
speech
concluded,
I
looked
on
her
with
distaste.
"Just
like
you,"
was
my
cold
answer.
"And
in
this
way
you
have
ousted
Mdlle.
Henri?
You
wanted
her
office,
therefore
you
rendered
it
intolerable
to
her?"
"Not
at
all,
monsieur,
I
was
merely
anxious
about
Mdlle.
Henri's
health;
no,
your
moral
sight
is
clear
and
piercing,
but
there
you
have
failed
to
discover
the
truth.
I
took
I
have
always
taken
a
real
interest
in
Mdlle.
Henri's
welfare;
I
did
not
like
her
going
out
in
all
weathers;
I
thought
it
would
be
more
advantageous
for
her
to
obtain
a
permanent
situation;
besides,
I
considered
her
now
qualified
to
do
something
more
than
teach
sewing.
I
reasoned
with
her;
left
the
decision
to
herself;
she
saw
the
correctness
of
my
views,
and
adopted
them."
"Excellent!
and
now,
mademoiselle,
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
give
me
her
address."
"Her
address!"
and
a
sombre
and
stony
change
came
over
the
mien
of
the
directress.
"Her
address?
Ah?
well
I
wish
I
could
oblige
you,
monsieur,
but
I
cannot,
and
I
will
tell
you
why;
whenever
I
myself
asked
her
for
her
address,
she
always
evaded
the
inquiry.
I
thought
I
may
be
wrong
but
I
THOUGHT
her
motive
for
doing
so,
was
a
natural,
though
mistaken
reluctance
to
introduce
me
to
some,
probably,
very
poor
abode;
her
means
were
narrow,
her
origin
obscure;
she
lives
somewhere,
doubtless,
in
the
'basse
ville.'"
"I'll
not
lose
sight
of
my
best
pupil
yet,"
said
I,
"though
she
were
born
of
beggars
and
lodged
in
a
cellar;
for
the
rest,
it
is
absurd
to
make
a
bugbear
of
her
origin
to
me
I
happen
to
know
that
she
was
a
Swiss
pastor's
daughter,
neither
more
nor
less;
and,
as
to
her
narrow
means,
I
care
nothing
for
the
poverty
of
her
purse
so
long
as
her
heart
overflows
with
affluence."
"Your
sentiments
are
perfectly
noble,
monsieur,"
said
the
directress,
affecting
to
suppress
a
yawn;
her
sprightliness
was
now
extinct,
her
temporary
candour
shut
up;
the
little,
red
coloured,
piratical
looking
pennon
of
audacity
she
had
allowed
to
float
a
minute
in
the
air,
was
furled,
and
the
broad,
sober
hued
flag
of
dissimulation
again
hung
low
over
the
citadel.
I
did
not
like
her
thus,
so
I
cut
short
the
TETE
A
TETE
and
departed.
NOVELISTS
should
never
allow
themselves
to
weary
of
the
study
of
real
life.
If
they
observed
this
duty
conscientiously,
they
would
give
us
fewer
pictures
chequered
with
vivid
contrasts
of
light
and
shade;
they
would
seldom
elevate
their
heroes
and
heroines
to
the
heights
of
rapture
still
seldomer
sink
them
to
the
depths
of
despair;
for
if
we
rarely
taste
the
fulness
of
joy
in
this
life,
we
yet
more
rarely
savour
the
acrid
bitterness
of
hopeless
anguish;
unless,
indeed,
we
have
plunged
like
beasts
into
sensual
indulgence,
abused,
strained,
stimulated,
again
overstrained,
and,
at
last,
destroyed
our
faculties
for
enjoyment;
then,
truly,
we
may
find
ourselves
without
support,
robbed
of
hope.
Our
agony
is
great,
and
how
can
it
end?
We
have
broken
the
spring
of
our
powers;
life
must
be
all
suffering
too
feeble
to
conceive
faith
death
must
be
darkness
God,
spirits,
religion
can
have
no
place
in
our
collapsed
minds,
where
linger
only
hideous
and
polluting
recollections
of
vice;
and
time
brings
us
on
to
the
brink
of
the
grave,
and
dissolution
flings
us
in
a
rag
eaten
through
and
through
with
disease,
wrung
together
with
pain,
stamped
into
the
churchyard
sod
by
the
inexorable
heel
of
despair.
But
the
man
of
regular
life
and
rational
mind
never
despairs.
He
loses
his
property
it
is
a
blow
he
staggers
a
moment;
then,
his
energies,
roused
by
the
smart,
are
at
work
to
seek
a
remedy;
activity
soon
mitigates
regret.
Sickness
affects
him;
he
takes
patience
endures
what
he
cannot
cure.
Acute
pain
racks
him;
his
writhing
limbs
know
not
where
to
find
rest;
he
leans
on
Hope's
anchors.
Death
takes
from
him
what
he
loves;
roots
up,
and
tears
violently
away
the
stem
round
which
his
affections
were
twined
a
dark,
dismal
time,
a
frightful
wrench
but
some
morning
Religion
looks
into
his
desolate
house
with
sunrise,
and
says,
that
in
another
world,
another
life,
he
shall
meet
his
kindred
again.
She
speaks
of
that
world
as
a
place
unsullied
by
sin
of
that
life,
as
an
era
unembittered
by
suffering;
she
mightily
strengthens
her
consolation
by
connecting
with
it
two
ideas
which
mortals
cannot
comprehend,
but
on
which
they
love
to
repose
Eternity,
Immortality;
and
the
mind
of
the
mourner,
being
filled
with
an
image,
faint
yet
glorious,
of
heavenly
hills
all
light
and
peace
of
a
spirit
resting
there
in
bliss
of
a
day
when
his
spirit
shall
also
alight
there,
free
and
disembodied
of
a
reunion
perfected
by
love,
purified
from
fear
he
takes
courage
goes
out
to
encounter
the
necessities
and
discharge
the
duties
of
life;
and,
though
sadness
may
never
lift
her
burden
from
his
mind,
Hope
will
enable
him
to
support
it.
Well
and
what
suggested
all
this?
and
what
is
the
inference
to
be
drawn
therefrom?
What
suggested
it,
is
the
circumstance
of
my
best
pupil
my
treasure
being
snatched
from
my
hands,
and
put
away
out
of
my
reach;
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
it
is
that,
being
a
steady,
reasonable
man,
I
did
not
allow
the
resentment,
disappointment,
and
grief,
engendered
in
my
mind
by
this
evil
chance,
to
grow
there
to
any
monstrous
size;
nor
did
I
allow
them
to
monopolize
the
whole
space
of
my
heart;
I
pent
them,
on
the
contrary,
in
one
strait
and
secret
nook.
In
the
daytime,
too,
when
I
was
about
my
duties,
I
put
them
on
the
silent
system;
and
it
was
only
after
I
had
closed
the
door
of
my
chamber
at
night
that
I
somewhat
relaxed
my
severity
towards
these
morose
nurslings,
and
allowed
vent
to
their
language
of
murmurs;
then,
in
revenge,
they
sat
on
my
pillow,
haunted
my
bed,
and
kept
me
awake
with
their
long,
midnight
cry.
A
week
passed.
I
had
said
nothing
more
to
Mdlle.
Reuter.
I
had
been
calm
in
my
demeanour
to
her,
though
stony
cold
and
hard.
When
I
looked
at
her,
it
was
with
the
glance
fitting
to
be
bestowed
on
one
who
I
knew
had
consulted
jealousy
as
an
adviser,
and
employed
treachery
as
an
instrument
the
glance
of
quiet
disdain
and
rooted
distrust.
On
Saturday
evening,
ere
I
left
the
house,
I
stept
into
the
SALLE
A
MANGER,
where
she
was
sitting
alone,
and,
placing
myself
before
her,
I
asked,
with
the
same
tranquil
tone
and
manner
that
I
should
have
used
had
I
put
the
question
for
the
first
time
"Mademoiselle,
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
give
me
the
address
of
Frances
Evans
Henri?"
A
little
surprised,
but
not
disconcerted,
she
smilingly
disclaimed
any
knowledge
of
that
address,
adding,
"Monsieur
has
perhaps
forgotten
that
I
explained
all
about
that
circumstance
before
a
week
ago?"
"Mademoiselle,"
I
continued,
"you
would
greatly
oblige
me
by
directing
me
to
that
young
person's
abode."
She
seemed
somewhat
puzzled;
and,
at
last,
looking
up
with
an
admirably
counterfeited
air
of
naivete,
she
demanded,
"Does
Monsieur
think
I
am
telling
an
untruth?"
Still
avoiding
to
give
her
a
direct
answer,
I
said,
"It
is
not
then
your
intention,
mademoiselle,
to
oblige
me
in
this
particular?"
"But,
monsieur,
how
can
I
tell
you
what
I
do
not
know?"
"Very
well;
I
understand
you
perfectly,
mademoiselle,
and
now
I
have
only
two
or
three
words
to
say.
This
is
the
last
week
in
July;
in
another
month
the
vacation
will
commence,
have
the
goodness
to
avail
yourself
of
the
leisure
it
will
afford
you
to
look
out
for
another
English
master
at
the
close
of
August,
I
shall
be
under
the
necessity
of
resigning
my
post
in
your
establishment."
I
did
not
wait
for
her
comments
on
this
announcement,
but
bowed
and
immediately
withdrew.
That
same
evening,
soon
after
dinner,
a
servant
brought
me
a
small
packet;
it
was
directed
in
a
hand
I
knew,
but
had
not
hoped
so
soon
to
see
again;
being
in
my
own
apartment
and
alone,
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
my
immediately
opening
it;
it
contained
four
five
franc
pieces,
and
a
note
in
English.
"MONSIEUR,
"I
came
to
Mdlle.
Reuter's
house
yesterday,
at
the
time
when
I
knew
you
would
be
just
about
finishing
your
lesson,
and
I
asked
if
I
might
go
into
the
schoolroom
and
speak
to
you.
Mdlle.
Reuter
came
out
and
said
you
were
already
gone;
it
had
not
yet
struck
four,
so
I
thought
she
must
be
mistaken,
but
concluded
it
would
be
vain
to
call
another
day
on
the
same
errand.
In
one
sense
a
note
will
do
as
well
it
will
wrap
up
the
20
francs,
the
price
of
the
lessons
I
have
received
from
you;
and
if
it
will
not
fully
express
the
thanks
I
owe
you
in
addition
if
it
will
not
bid
you
good
bye
as
I
could
wish
to
have
done
if
it
will
not
tell
you,
as
I
long
to
do,
how
sorry
I
am
that
I
shall
probably
never
see
you
more
why,
spoken
words
would
hardly
be
more
adequate
to
the
task.
Had
I
seen
you,
I
should
probably
have
stammered
out
something
feeble
and
unsatisfactory
something
belying
my
feelings
rather
than
explaining
them;
so
it
is
perhaps
as
well
that
I
was
denied
admission
to
your
presence.
You
often
remarked,
monsieur,
that
my
devoirs
dwelt
a
great
deal
on
fortitude
in
bearing
grief
you
said
I
introduced
that
theme
too
often:
I
find
indeed
that
it
is
much
easier
to
write
about
a
severe
duty
than
to
perform
it,
for
I
am
oppressed
when
I
see
and
feel
to
what
a
reverse
fate
has
condemned
me;
you
were
kind
to
me,
monsieur
very
kind;
I
am
afflicted
I
am
heart
broken
to
be
quite
separated
from
you;
soon
I
shall
have
no
friend
on
earth.
But
it
is
useless
troubling
you
with
my
distresses.
What
claim
have
I
on
your
sympathy?
None;
I
will
then
say
no
more.
"Farewell,
Monsieur.
"F.
E.
HENRI."
I
put
up
the
note
in
my
pocket
book.
I
slipped
the
five
franc
pieces
into
my
purse
then
I
took
a
turn
through
my
narrow
chamber.
"Mdlle.
Reuter
talked
about
her
poverty,"
said
I,
"and
she
is
poor;
yet
she
pays
her
debts
and
more.
I
have
not
yet
given
her
a
quarter's
lessons,
and
she
has
sent
me
a
quarter's
due.
I
wonder
of
what
she
deprived
herself
to
scrape
together
the
twenty
francs
I
wonder
what
sort
of
a
place
she
has
to
live
in,
and
what
sort
of
a
woman
her
aunt
is,
and
whether
she
is
likely
to
get
employment
to
supply
the
place
she
has
lost.
No
doubt
she
will
have
to
trudge
about
long
enough
from
school
to
school,
to
inquire
here,
and
apply
there
be
rejected
in
this
place,
disappointed
in
that.
Many
an
evening
she'll
go
to
her
bed
tired
and
unsuccessful.
And
the
directress
would
not
let
her
in
to
bid
me
good
bye?
I
might
not
have
the
chance
of
standing
with
her
for
a
few
minutes
at
a
window
in
the
schoolroom
and
exchanging
some
half
dozen
of
sentences
getting
to
know
where
she
lived
putting
matters
in
train
for
having
all
things
arranged
to
my
mind?
No
address
on
the
note"
I
continued,
drawing
it
again
from
the
pocket
book
and
examining
it
on
each
side
of
the
two
leaves:
"women
are
women,
that
is
certain,
and
always
do
business
like
women;
men
mechanically
put
a
date
and
address
to
their
communications.
And
these
five
franc
pieces?"
(I
hauled
them
forth
from
my
purse)
"if
she
had
offered
me
them
herself
instead
of
tying
them
up
with
a
thread
of
green
silk
in
a
kind
of
Lilliputian
packet,
I
could
have
thrust
them
back
into
her
little
hand,
and
shut
up
the
small,
taper
fingers
over
them
so
and
compelled
her
shame,
her
pride,
her
shyness,
all
to
yield
to
a
little
bit
of
determined
Will
now
where
is
she?
How
can
I
get
at
her?"
Opening
my
chamber
door
I
walked
down
into
the
kitchen.
"Who
brought
the
packet?"
I
asked
of
the
servant
who
had
delivered
it
to
me.
"Un
petit
commissionaire,
monsieur."
"Did
he
say
anything?"
"Rien."
And
I
wended
my
way
up
the
back
stairs,
wondrously
the
wiser
for
my
inquiries.
"No
matter,"
said
I
to
myself,
as
I
again
closed
the
door.
"No
matter
I'll
seek
her
through
Brussels."
And
I
did.
I
sought
her
day
by
day
whenever
I
had
a
moment's
leisure,
for
four
weeks;
I
sought
her
on
Sundays
all
day
long;
I
sought
her
on
the
Boulevards,
in
the
Allee
Verte,
in
the
Park;
I
sought
her
in
Ste.
Gudule
and
St.
Jacques;
I
sought
her
in
the
two
Protestant
chapels;
I
attended
these
latter
at
the
German,
French,
and
English
services,
not
doubting
that
I
should
meet
her
at
one
of
them.
All
my
researches
were
absolutely
fruitless;
my
security
on
the
last
point
was
proved
by
the
event
to
be
equally
groundless
with
my
other
calculations.
I
stood
at
the
door
of
each
chapel
after
the
service,
and
waited
till
every
individual
had
come
out,
scrutinizing
every
gown
draping
a
slender
form,
peering
under
every
bonnet
covering
a
young
head.
In
vain;
I
saw
girlish
figures
pass
me,
drawing
their
black
scarfs
over
their
sloping
shoulders,
but
none
of
them
had
the
exact
turn
and
air
of
Mdlle.
Henri's;
I
saw
pale
and
thoughtful
faces
"encadrees"
in
bands
of
brown
hair,
but
I
never
found
her
forehead,
her
eyes,
her
eyebrows.
All
the
features
of
all
the
faces
I
met
seemed
frittered
away,
because
my
eye
failed
to
recognize
the
peculiarities
it
was
bent
upon;
an
ample
space
of
brow
and
a
large,
dark,
and
serious
eye,
with
a
fine
but
decided
line
of
eyebrow
traced
above.
"She
has
probably
left
Brussels
perhaps
is
gone
to
England,
as
she
said
she
would,"
muttered
I
inwardly,
as
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
Sunday,
I
turned
from
the
door
of
the
chapel
royal
which
the
door
keeper
had
just
closed
and
locked,
and
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
last
of
the
congregation,
now
dispersed
and
dispersing
over
the
square.
I
had
soon
outwalked
the
couples
of
English
gentlemen
and
ladies.
(Gracious
goodness!
why
don't
they
dress
better?
My
eye
is
yet
filled
with
visions
of
the
high
flounced,
slovenly,
and
tumbled
dresses
in
costly
silk
and
satin,
of
the
large
unbecoming
collars
in
expensive
lace;
of
the
ill
cut
coats
and
strangely
fashioned
pantaloons
which
every
Sunday,
at
the
English
service,
filled
the
choirs
of
the
chapel
royal,
and
after
it,
issuing
forth
into
the
square,
came
into
disadvantageous
contrast
with
freshly
and
trimly
attired
foreign
figures,
hastening
to
attend
salut
at
the
church
of
Coburg.)
I
had
passed
these
pairs
of
Britons,
and
the
groups
of
pretty
British
children,
and
the
British
footmen
and
waiting
maids;
I
had
crossed
the
Place
Royale,
and
got
into
the
Rue
Royale,
thence
I
had
diverged
into
the
Rue
de
Louvain
an
old
and
quiet
street.
I
remember
that,
feeling
a
little
hungry,
and
not
desiring
to
go
back
and
take
my
share
of
the
"gouter,"
now
on
the
refectory
table
at
Pelet's
to
wit,
pistolets
and
water
I
stepped
into
a
baker's
and
refreshed
myself
on
a
COUC(?)
it
is
a
Flemish
word,
I
don't
know
how
to
spell
it
A
CORINTHE
ANGLICE,
a
currant
bun
and
a
cup
of
coffee;
and
then
I
strolled
on
towards
the
Porte
de
Louvain.
Very
soon
I
was
out
of
the
city,
and
slowly
mounting
the
hill,
which
ascends
from
the
gate,
I
took
my
time;
for
the
afternoon,
though
cloudy,
was
very
sultry,
and
not
a
breeze
stirred
to
refresh
the
atmosphere.
No
inhabitant
of
Brussels
need
wander
far
to
search
for
solitude;
let
him
but
move
half
a
league
from
his
own
city
and
he
will
find
her
brooding
still
and
blank
over
the
wide
fields,
so
drear
though
so
fertile,
spread
out
treeless
and
trackless
round
the
capital
of
Brabant.
Having
gained
the
summit
of
the
hill,
and
having
stood
and
looked
long
over
the
cultured
but
lifeless
campaign,
I
felt
a
wish
to
quit
the
high
road,
which
I
had
hitherto
followed,
and
get
in
among
those
tilled
grounds
fertile
as
the
beds
of
a
Brobdignagian
kitchen
garden
spreading
far
and
wide
even
to
the
boundaries
of
the
horizon,
where,
from
a
dusk
green,
distance
changed
them
to
a
sullen
blue,
and
confused
their
tints
with
those
of
the
livid
and
thunderous
looking
sky.
Accordingly
I
turned
up
a
by
path
to
the
right;
I
had
not
followed
it
far
ere
it
brought
me,
as
I
expected,
into
the
fields,
amidst
which,
just
before
me,
stretched
a
long
and
lofty
white
wall
enclosing,
as
it
seemed
from
the
foliage
showing
above,
some
thickly
planted
nursery
of
yew
and
cypress,
for
of
that
species
were
the
branches
resting
on
the
pale
parapets,
and
crowding
gloomily
about
a
massive
cross,
planted
doubtless
on
a
central
eminence
and
extending
its
arms,
which
seemed
of
black
marble,
over
the
summits
of
those
sinister
trees.
I
approached,
wondering
to
what
house
this
well
protected
garden
appertained;
I
turned
the
angle
of
the
wall,
thinking
to
see
some
stately
residence;
I
was
close
upon
great
iron
gates;
there
was
a
hut
serving
for
a
lodge
near,
but
I
had
no
occasion
to
apply
for
the
key
the
gates
were
open;
I
pushed
one
leaf
back
rain
had
rusted
its
hinges,
for
it
groaned
dolefully
as
they
revolved.
Thick
planting
embowered
the
entrance.
Passing
up
the
avenue,
I
saw
objects
on
each
hand
which,
in
their
own
mute
language
of
inscription
and
sign,
explained
clearly
to
what
abode
I
had
made
my
way.
This
was
the
house
appointed
for
all
living;
crosses,
monuments,
and
garlands
of
everlastings
announced,
"The
Protestant
Cemetery,
outside
the
gate
of
Louvain."
The
place
was
large
enough
to
afford
half
an
hour's
strolling
without
the
monotony
of
treading
continually
the
same
path;
and,
for
those
who
love
to
peruse
the
annals
of
graveyards,
here
was
variety
of
inscription
enough
to
occupy
the
attention
for
double
or
treble
that
space
of
time.
Hither
people
of
many
kindreds,
tongues,
and
nations,
had
brought
their
dead
for
interment;
and
here,
on
pages
of
stone,
of
marble,
and
of
brass,
were
written
names,
dates,
last
tributes
of
pomp
or
love,
in
English,
in
French,
in
German,
and
Latin.
Here
the
Englishman
had
erected
a
marble
monument
over
the
remains
of
his
Mary
Smith
or
Jane
Brown,
and
inscribed
it
only
with
her
name.
There
the
French
widower
had
shaded
the
grave
of
his
Elmire
or
Celestine
with
a
brilliant
thicket
of
roses,
amidst
which
a
little
tablet
rising,
bore
an
equally
bright
testimony
to
her
countless
virtues.
Every
nation,
tribe,
and
kindred,
mourned
after
its
own
fashion;
and
how
soundless
was
the
mourning
of
all!
My
own
tread,
though
slow
and
upon
smooth
rolled
paths,
seemed
to
startle,
because
it
formed
the
sole
break
to
a
silence
otherwise
total.
Not
only
the
winds,
but
the
very
fitful,
wandering
airs,
were
that
afternoon,
as
by
common
consent,
all
fallen
asleep
in
their
various
quarters;
the
north
was
hushed,
the
south
silent,
the
east
sobbed
not,
nor
did
the
west
whisper.
The
clouds
in
heaven
were
condensed
and
dull,
but
apparently
quite
motionless.
Under
the
trees
of
this
cemetery
nestled
a
warm
breathless
gloom,
out
of
which
the
cypresses
stood
up
straight
and
mute,
above
which
the
willows
hung
low
and
still;
where
the
flowers,
as
languid
as
fair,
waited
listless
for
night
dew
or
thunder
shower;
where
the
tombs,
and
those
they
hid,
lay
impassible
to
sun
or
shadow,
to
rain
or
drought.
Importuned
by
the
sound
of
my
own
footsteps,
I
turned
off
upon
the
turf,
and
slowly
advanced
to
a
grove
of
yews;
I
saw
something
stir
among
the
stems;
I
thought
it
might
be
a
broken
branch
swinging,
my
short
sighted
vision
had
caught
no
form,
only
a
sense
of
motion;
but
the
dusky
shade
passed
on,
appearing
and
disappearing
at
the
openings
in
the
avenue.
I
soon
discerned
it
was
a
living
thing,
and
a
human
thing;
and,
drawing
nearer,
I
perceived
it
was
a
woman,
pacing
slowly
to
and
fro,
and
evidently
deeming
herself
alone
as
I
had
deemed
myself
alone,
and
meditating
as
I
had
been
meditating.
Ere
long
she
returned
to
a
seat
which
I
fancy
she
had
but
just
quitted,
or
I
should
have
caught
sight
of
her
before.
It
was
in
a
nook,
screened
by
a
clump
of
trees;
there
was
the
white
wall
before
her,
and
a
little
stone
set
up
against
the
wall,
and,
at
the
foot
of
the
stone,
was
an
allotment
of
turf
freshly
turned
up,
a
new
made
grave.
I
put
on
my
spectacles,
and
passed
softly
close
behind
her;
glancing
at
the
inscription
on
the
stone,
I
read,
"Julienne
Henri,
died
at
Brussels,
aged
sixty.
August
10th,
18
."
Having
perused
the
inscription,
I
looked
down
at
the
form
sitting
bent
and
thoughtful
just
under
my
eyes,
unconscious
of
the
vicinity
of
any
living
thing;
it
was
a
slim,
youthful
figure
in
mourning
apparel
of
the
plainest
black
stuff,
with
a
little
simple,
black
crape
bonnet;
I
felt,
as
well
as
saw,
who
it
was;
and,
moving
neither
hand
nor
foot,
I
stood
some
moments
enjoying
the
security
of
conviction.
I
had
sought
her
for
a
month,
and
had
never
discovered
one
of
her
traces
never
met
a
hope,
or
seized
a
chance
of
encountering
her
anywhere.
I
had
been
forced
to
loosen
my
grasp
on
expectation;
and,
but
an
hour
ago,
had
sunk
slackly
under
the
discouraging
thought
that
the
current
of
life,
and
the
impulse
of
destiny,
had
swept
her
for
ever
from
my
reach;
and,
behold,
while
bending
suddenly
earthward
beneath
the
pressure
of
despondency
while
following
with
my
eyes
the
track
of
sorrow
on
the
turf
of
a
graveyard
here
was
my
lost
jewel
dropped
on
the
tear
fed
herbage,
nestling
in
the
messy
and
mouldy
roots
of
yew
trees.
Frances
sat
very
quiet,
her
elbow
on
her
knee,
and
her
head
on
her
hand.
I
knew
she
could
retain
a
thinking
attitude
a
long
time
without
change;
at
last,
a
tear
fell;
she
had
been
looking
at
the
name
on
the
stone
before
her,
and
her
heart
had
no
doubt
endured
one
of
those
constrictions
with
which
the
desolate
living,
regretting
the
dead,
are,
at
times,
so
sorely
oppressed.
Many
tears
rolled
down,
which
she
wiped
away,
again
and
again,
with
her
handkerchief;
some
distressed
sobs
escaped
her,
and
then,
the
paroxysm
over,
she
sat
quiet
as
before.
I
put
my
hand
gently
on
her
shoulder;
no
need
further
to
prepare
her,
for
she
was
neither
hysterical
nor
liable
to
fainting
fits;
a
sudden
push,
indeed,
might
have
startled
her,
but
the
contact
of
my
quiet
touch
merely
woke
attention
as
I
wished;
and,
though
she
turned
quickly,
yet
so
lightning
swift
is
thought
in
some
minds
especially
I
believe
the
wonder
of
what
the
consciousness
of
who
it
was
that
thus
stole
unawares
on
her
solitude,
had
passed
through
her
brain,
and
flashed
into
her
heart,
even
before
she
had
effected
that
hasty
movement;
at
least,
Amazement
had
hardly
opened
her
eyes
and
raised
them
to
mine,
ere
Recognition
informed
their
irids
with
most
speaking
brightness.
Nervous
surprise
had
hardly
discomposed
her
features
ere
a
sentiment
of
most
vivid
joy
shone
clear
and
warm
on
her
whole
countenance.
I
had
hardly
time
to
observe
that
she
was
wasted
and
pale,
ere
called
to
feel
a
responsive
inward
pleasure
by
the
sense
of
most
full
and
exquisite
pleasure
glowing
in
the
animated
flush,
and
shining
in
the
expansive
light,
now
diffused
over
my
pupil's
face.
It
was
the
summer
sun
flashing
out
after
the
heavy
summer
shower;
and
what
fertilizes
more
rapidly
than
that
beam,
burning
almost
like
fire
in
its
ardour?
I
hate
boldness
that
boldness
which
is
of
the
brassy
brow
and
insensate
nerves;
but
I
love
the
courage
of
the
strong
heart,
the
fervour
of
the
generous
blood;
I
loved
with
passion
the
light
of
Frances
Evans'
clear
hazel
eye
when
it
did
not
fear
to
look
straight
into
mine;
I
loved
the
tones
with
which
she
uttered
the
words
"Mon
maitre!
mon
maitre!"
I
loved
the
movement
with
which
she
confided
her
hand
to
my
hand;
I
loved
her
as
she
stood
there,
penniless
and
parentless;
for
a
sensualist
charmless,
for
me
a
treasure
my
best
object
of
sympathy
on
earth,
thinking
such
thoughts
as
I
thought,
feeling
such
feelings
as
I
felt;
my
ideal
of
the
shrine
in
which
to
seal
my
stores
of
love;
personification
of
discretion
and
forethought,
of
diligence
and
perseverance,
of
self
denial
and
self
control
those
guardians,
those
trusty
keepers
of
the
gift
I
longed
to
confer
on
her
the
gift
of
all
my
affections;
model
of
truth
and
honour,
of
independence
and
conscientiousness
those
refiners
and
sustainers
of
an
honest
life;
silent
possessor
of
a
well
of
tenderness,
of
a
flame,
as
genial
as
still,
as
pure
as
quenchless,
of
natural
feeling,
natural
passion
those
sources
of
refreshment
and
comfort
to
the
sanctuary
of
home.
I
knew
how
quietly
and
how
deeply
the
well
bubbled
in
her
heart;
I
knew
how
the
more
dangerous
flame
burned
safely
under
the
eye
of
reason;
I
had
seen
when
the
fire
shot
up
a
moment
high
and
vivid,
when
the
accelerated
heat
troubled
life's
current
in
its
channels;
I
had
seen
reason
reduce
the
rebel,
and
humble
its
blaze
to
embers.
I
had
confidence
in
Frances
Evans;
I
had
respect
for
her,
and
as
I
drew
her
arm
through
mine,
and
led
her
out
of
the
cemetery,
I
felt
I
had
another
sentiment,
as
strong
as
confidence,
as
firm
as
respect,
more
fervid
than
either
that
of
love.
"Well,
my
pupil,"
said
I,
as
the
ominous
sounding
gate
swung
to
behind
us
"Well,
I
have
found
you
again:
a
month's
search
has
seemed
long,
and
I
little
thought
to
have
discovered
my
lost
sheep
straying
amongst
graves."
Never
had
I
addressed
her
but
as
"Mademoiselle"
before,
and
to
speak
thus
was
to
take
up
a
tone
new
to
both
her
and
me.
Her
answer
suprised
me
that
this
language
ruffled
none
of
her
feelings,
woke
no
discord
in
her
heart:
"Mon
maitre,"
she
said,
"have
you
troubled
yourself
to
seek
me?
I
little
imagined
you
would
think
much
of
my
absence,
but
I
grieved
bitterly
to
be
taken
away
from
you.
I
was
sorry
for
that
circumstance
when
heavier
troubles
ought
to
have
made
me
forget
it."
"Your
aunt
is
dead?"
"Yes,
a
fortnight
since,
and
she
died
full
of
regret,
which
I
could
not
chase
from
her
mind;
she
kept
repeating,
even
during
the
last
night
of
her
existence,
'Frances,
you
will
be
so
lonely
when
I
am
gone,
so
friendless:'
she
wished
too
that
she
could
have
been
buried
in
Switzerland,
and
it
was
I
who
persuaded
her
in
her
old
age
to
leave
the
banks
of
Lake
Leman,
and
to
come,
only
as
it
seems
to
die,
in
this
flat
region
of
Flanders.
Willingly
would
I
have
observed
her
last
wish,
and
taken
her
remains
back
to
our
own
country,
but
that
was
impossible;
I
was
forced
to
lay
her
here."
"She
was
ill
but
a
short
time,
I
presume?"
"But
three
weeks.
When
she
began
to
sink
I
asked
Mdlle.
Reuter's
leave
to
stay
with
her
and
wait
on
her;
I
readily
got
leave."
"Do
you
return
to
the
pensionnat!"
I
demanded
hastily.
"Monsieur,
when
I
had
been
at
home
a
week
Mdlle.
Reuter
called
one
evening,
just
after
I
had
got
my
aunt
to
bed;
she
went
into
her
room
to
speak
to
her,
and
was
extremely
civil
and
affable,
as
she
always
is;
afterwards
she
came
and
sat
with
me
a
long
time,
and
just
as
she
rose
to
go
away,
she
said:
"Mademoiselle,
I
shall
not
soon
cease
to
regret
your
departure
from
my
establishment,
though
indeed
it
is
true
that
you
have
taught
your
class
of
pupils
so
well
that
they
are
all
quite
accomplished
in
the
little
works
you
manage
so
skilfully,
and
have
not
the
slightest
need
of
further
instruction;
my
second
teacher
must
in
future
supply
your
place,
with
regard
to
the
younger
pupils,
as
well
as
she
can,
though
she
is
indeed
an
inferior
artiste
to
you,
and
doubtless
it
will
be
your
part
now
to
assume
a
higher
position
in
your
calling;
I
am
sure
you
will
everywhere
find
schools
and
families
willing
to
profit
by
your
talents.'
And
then
she
paid
me
my
last
quarter's
salary.
I
asked,
as
mademoiselle
would
no
doubt
think,
very
bluntly,
if
she
designed
to
discharge
me
from
the
establishment.
She
smiled
at
my
inelegance
of
speech,
and
answered
that
'our
connection
as
employer
and
employed
was
certainly
dissolved,
but
that
she
hoped
still
to
retain
the
pleasure
of
my
acquaintance;
she
should
always
be
happy
to
see
me
as
a
friend;'
and
then
she
said
something
about
the
excellent
condition
of
the
streets,
and
the
long
continuance
of
fine
weather,
and
went
away
quite
cheerful."
I
laughed
inwardly;
all
this
was
so
like
the
directress
so
like
what
I
had
expected
and
guessed
of
her
conduct;
and
then
the
exposure
and
proof
of
her
lie,
unconsciously
afforded
by
Frances:
"She
had
frequently
applied
for
Mdlle.
Henri's
address,"
forsooth;
"Mdlle.
Henri
had
always
evaded
giving
it,"
&c.,
&c.,
and
here
I
found
her
a
visitor
at
the
very
house
of
whose
locality
she
had
professed
absolute
ignorance!
Any
comments
I
might
have
intended
to
make
on
my
pupil's
communication,
were
checked
by
the
plashing
of
large
rain
drops
on
our
faces
and
on
the
path,
and
by
the
muttering
of
a
distant
but
coming
storm.
The
warning
obvious
in
stagnant
air
and
leaden
sky
had
already
induced
me
to
take
the
road
leading
back
to
Brussels,
and
now
I
hastened
my
own
steps
and
those
of
my
companion,
and,
as
our
way
lay
downhill,
we
got
on
rapidly.
There
was
an
interval
after
the
fall
of
the
first
broad
drops
before
heavy
rain
came
on;
in
the
meantime
we
had
passed
through
the
Porte
de
Louvain,
and
were
again
in
the
city.
"Where
do
you
live?"
I
asked;
"I
will
see
you
safe
home."
"Rue
Notre
Dame
aux
Neiges,"
answered
Frances.
It
was
not
far
from
the
Rue
de
Louvain,
and
we
stood
on
the
doorsteps
of
the
house
we
sought
ere
the
clouds,
severing
with
loud
peal
and
shattered
cataract
of
lightning,
emptied
their
livid
folds
in
a
torrent,
heavy,
prone,
and
broad.
"Come
in!
come
in!"
said
Frances,
as,
after
putting
her
into
the
house,
I
paused
ere
I
followed:
the
word
decided
me;
I
stepped
across
the
threshold,
shut
the
door
on
the
rushing,
flashing,
whitening
storm,
and
followed
her
upstairs
to
her
apartments.
Neither
she
nor
I
were
wet;
a
projection
over
the
door
had
warded
off
the
straight
descending
flood;
none
but
the
first,
large
drops
had
touched
our
garments;
one
minute
more
and
we
should
not
have
had
a
dry
thread
on
us.
Stepping
over
a
little
mat
of
green
wool,
I
found
myself
in
a
small
room
with
a
painted
floor
and
a
square
of
green
carpet
in
the
middle;
the
articles
of
furniture
were
few,
but
all
bright
and
exquisitely
clean;
order
reigned
through
its
narrow
limits
such
order
as
it
soothed
my
punctilious
soul
to
behold.
And
I
had
hesitated
to
enter
the
abode,
because
I
apprehended
after
all
that
Mdlle.
Reuter's
hint
about
its
extreme
poverty
might
be
too
well
founded,
and
I
feared
to
embarrass
the
lace
mender
by
entering
her
lodgings
unawares!
Poor
the
place
might
be;
poor
truly
it
was;
but
its
neatness
was
better
than
elegance,
and
had
but
a
bright
little
fire
shone
on
that
clean
hearth,
I
should
have
deemed
it
more
attractive
than
a
palace.
No
fire
was
there,
however,
and
no
fuel
laid
ready
to
light;
the
lace
mender
was
unable
to
allow
herself
that
indulgence,
especially
now
when,
deprived
by
death
of
her
sole
relative,
she
had
only
her
own
unaided
exertions
to
rely
on.
Frances
went
into
an
inner
room
to
take
off
her
bonnet,
and
she
came
out
a
model
of
frugal
neatness,
with
her
well
fitting
black
stuff
dress,
so
accurately
defining
her
elegant
bust
and
taper
waist,
with
her
spotless
white
collar
turned
back
from
a
fair
and
shapely
neck,
with
her
plenteous
brown
hair
arranged
in
smooth
bands
on
her
temples,
and
in
a
large
Grecian
plait
behind:
ornaments
she
had
none
neither
brooch,
ring,
nor
ribbon;
she
did
well
enough
without
them
perfection
of
fit,
proportion
of
form,
grace
of
carriage,
agreeably
supplied
their
place.
Her
eye,
as
she
re
entered
the
small
sitting
room,
instantly
sought
mine,
which
was
just
then
lingering
on
the
hearth;
I
knew
she
read
at
once
the
sort
of
inward
ruth
and
pitying
pain
which
the
chill
vacancy
of
that
hearth
stirred
in
my
soul:
quick
to
penetrate,
quick
to
determine,
and
quicker
to
put
in
practice,
she
had
in
a
moment
tied
a
holland
apron
round
her
waist;
then
she
disappeared,
and
reappeared
with
a
basket;
it
had
a
cover;
she
opened
it,
and
produced
wood
and
coal;
deftly
and
compactly
she
arranged
them
in
the
grate.
"It
is
her
whole
stock,
and
she
will
exhaust
it
out
of
hospitality,"
thought
I.
"What
are
you
going
to
do?"
I
asked:
"not
surely
to
light
a
fire
this
hot
evening?
I
shall
be
smothered."
"Indeed,
monsieur,
I
feel
it
very
chilly
since
the
rain
began;
besides,
I
must
boil
the
water
for
my
tea,
for
I
take
tea
on
Sundays;
you
will
be
obliged
to
try
and
bear
the
heat."
She
had
struck
a
light;
the
wood
was
already
in
a
blaze;
and
truly,
when
contrasted
with
the
darkness,
the
wild
tumult
of
the
tempest
without,
that
peaceful
glow
which
began
to
beam
on
the
now
animated
hearth,
seemed
very
cheering.
A
low,
purring
sound,
from
some
quarter,
announced
that
another
being,
besides
myself,
was
pleased
with
the
change;
a
black
cat,
roused
by
the
light
from
its
sleep
on
a
little
cushioned
foot
stool,
came
and
rubbed
its
head
against
Frances'
gown
as
she
knelt;
she
caressed
it,
saying
it
had
been
a
favourite
with
her
"pauvre
tante
Julienne."
The
fire
being
lit,
the
hearth
swept,
and
a
small
kettle
of
a
very
antique
pattern,
such
as
I
thought
I
remembered
to
have
seen
in
old
farmhouses
in
England,
placed
over
the
now
ruddy
flame,
Frances'
hands
were
washed,
and
her
apron
removed
in
an
instant;
then
she
opened
a
cupboard,
and
took
out
a
tea
tray,
on
which
she
had
soon
arranged
a
china
tea
equipage,
whose
pattern,
shape,
and
size,
denoted
a
remote
antiquity;
a
little,
old
fashioned
silver
spoon
was
deposited
in
each
saucer;
and
a
pair
of
silver
tongs,
equally
old
fashioned,
were
laid
on
the
sugar
basin;
from
the
cupboard,
too,
was
produced
a
tidy
silver
cream
ewer,
not
larger
then
an
egg
shell.
While
making
these
preparations,
she
chanced
to
look
up,
and,
reading
curiosity
in
my
eyes,
she
smiled
and
asked
"Is
this
like
England,
monsieur?"
"Like
the
England
of
a
hundred
years
ago,"
I
replied.
"Is
it
truly?
Well,
everything
on
this
tray
is
at
least
a
hundred
years
old:
these
cups,
these
spoons,
this
ewer,
are
all
heirlooms;
my
great
grandmother
left
them
to
my
grandmother,
she
to
my
mother,
and
my
mother
brought
them
with
her
from
England
to
Switzerland,
and
left
them
to
me;
and,
ever
since
I
was
a
little
girl,
I
have
thought
I
should
like
to
carry
them
back
to
England,
whence
they
came."
She
put
some
pistolets
on
the
table;
she
made
the
tea,
as
foreigners
do
make
tea
i.e.,
at
the
rate
of
a
teaspoonful
to
half
a
dozen
cups;
she
placed
me
a
chair,
and,
as
I
took
it,
she
asked,
with
a
sort
of
exaltation
"Will
it
make
you
think
yourself
at
home
for
a
moment?"
"If
I
had
a
home
in
England,
I
believe
it
would
recall
it,"
I
answered;
and,
in
truth,
there
was
a
sort
of
illusion
in
seeing
the
fair
complexioned
English
looking
girl
presiding
at
the
English
meal,
and
speaking
in
the
English
language.
"You
have
then
no
home?"
was
her
remark.
"None,
nor
ever
have
had.
If
ever
I
possess
a
home,
it
must
be
of
my
own
making,
and
the
task
is
yet
to
begin."
And,
as
I
spoke,
a
pang,
new
to
me,
shot
across
my
heart:
it
was
a
pang
of
mortification
at
the
humility
of
my
position,
and
the
inadequacy
of
my
means;
while
with
that
pang
was
born
a
strong
desire
to
do
more,
earn
more,
be
more,
possess
more;
and
in
the
increased
possessions,
my
roused
and
eager
spirit
panted
to
include
the
home
I
had
never
had,
the
wife
I
inwardly
vowed
to
win.
Frances'
tea
was
little
better
than
hot
water,
sugar,
and
milk;
and
her
pistolets,
with
which
she
could
not
offer
me
butter,
were
sweet
to
my
palate
as
manna.
The
repast
over,
and
the
treasured
plate
and
porcelain
being
washed
and
put
by,
the
bright
table
rubbed
still
brighter,
"le
chat
de
ma
tante
Julienne"
also
being
fed
with
provisions
brought
forth
on
a
plate
for
its
special
use,
a
few
stray
cinders,
and
a
scattering
of
ashes
too,
being
swept
from
the
hearth,
Frances
at
last
sat
down;
and
then,
as
she
took
a
chair
opposite
to
me,
she
betrayed,
for
the
first
time,
a
little
embarrassment;
and
no
wonder,
for
indeed
I
had
unconsciously
watched
her
rather
too
closely,
followed
all
her
steps
and
all
her
movements
a
little
too
perseveringly
with
my
eyes,
for
she
mesmerized
me
by
the
grace
and
alertness
of
her
action
by
the
deft,
cleanly,
and
even
decorative
effect
resulting
from
each
touch
of
her
slight
and
fine
fingers;
and
when,
at
last,
she
subsided
to
stillness,
the
intelligence
of
her
face
seemed
beauty
to
me,
and
I
dwelt
on
it
accordingly.
Her
colour,
however,
rising,
rather
than
settling
with
repose,
and
her
eyes
remaining
downcast,
though
I
kept
waiting
for
the
lids
to
be
raised
that
I
might
drink
a
ray
of
the
light
I
loved
a
light
where
fire
dissolved
in
softness,
where
affection
tempered
penetration,
where,
just
now
at
least,
pleasure
played
with
thought
this
expectation
not
being
gratified,
I
began
at
last
to
suspect
that
I
had
probably
myself
to
blame
for
the
disappointment;
I
must
cease
gazing,
and
begin
talking,
if
I
wished
to
break
the
spell
under
which
she
now
sat
motionless;
so
recollecting
the
composing
effect
which
an
authoritative
tone
and
manner
had
ever
been
wont
to
produce
on
her,
I
said
"Get
one
of
your
English
books,
mademoiselle,
for
the
rain
yet
falls
heavily,
and
will
probably
detain
me
half
an
hour
longer."
Released,
and
set
at
ease,
up
she
rose,
got
her
book,
and
accepted
at
once
the
chair
I
placed
for
her
at
my
side.
She
had
selected
"Paradise
Lost"
from
her
shelf
of
classics,
thinking,
I
suppose,
the
religious
character
of
the
book
best
adapted
it
to
Sunday;
I
told
her
to
begin
at
the
beginning,
and
while
she
read
Milton's
invocation
to
that
heavenly
muse,
who
on
the
"secret
top
of
Oreb
or
Sinai"
had
taught
the
Hebrew
shepherd
how
in
the
womb
of
chaos,
the
conception
of
a
world
had
originated
and
ripened,
I
enjoyed,
undisturbed,
the
treble
pleasure
of
having
her
near
me,
hearing
the
sound
of
her
voice
a
sound
sweet
and
satisfying
in
my
ear
and
looking,
by
intervals,
at
her
face:
of
this
last
privilege,
I
chiefly
availed
myself
when
I
found
fault
with
an
intonation,
a
pause,
or
an
emphasis;
as
long
as
I
dogmatized,
I
might
also
gaze,
without
exciting
too
warm
a
flush.
"Enough,"
said
I,
when
she
had
gone
through
some
half
dozen
pages
(a
work
of
time
with
her,
for
she
read
slowly
and
paused
often
to
ask
and
receive
information)
"enough;
and
now
the
rain
is
ceasing,
and
I
must
soon
go."
For
indeed,
at
that
moment,
looking
towards
the
window,
I
saw
it
all
blue;
the
thunder
clouds
were
broken
and
scattered,
and
the
setting
August
sun
sent
a
gleam
like
the
reflection
of
rubies
through
the
lattice.
I
got
up;
I
drew
on
my
gloves.
"You
have
not
yet
found
another
situation
to
supply
the
place
of
that
from
which
you
were
dismissed
by
Mdlle.
Reuter?"
"No,
monsieur;
I
have
made
inquiries
everywhere,
but
they
all
ask
me
for
references;
and
to
speak
truth,
I
do
not
like
to
apply
to
the
directress,
because
I
consider
she
acted
neither
justly
nor
honourably
towards
me;
she
used
underhand
means
to
set
my
pupils
against
me,
and
thereby
render
me
unhappy
while
I
held
my
place
in
her
establishment,
and
she
eventually
deprived
me
of
it
by
a
masked
and
hypocritical
manoeuvre,
pretending
that
she
was
acting
for
my
good,
but
really
snatching
from
me
my
chief
means
of
subsistence,
at
a
crisis
when
not
only
my
own
life,
but
that
of
another,
depended
on
my
exertions:
of
her
I
will
never
more
ask
a
favour."
"How,
then,
do
you
propose
to
get
on?
How
do
you
live
now?"
"I
have
still
my
lace
mending
trade;
with
care
it
will
keep
me
from
starvation,
and
I
doubt
not
by
dint
of
exertion
to
get
better
employment
yet;
it
is
only
a
fortnight
since
I
began
to
try;
my
courage
or
hopes
are
by
no
means
worn
out
yet."
"And
if
you
get
what
you
wish,
what
then?
what
are
your
ultimate
views?"
"To
save
enough
to
cross
the
Channel:
I
always
look
to
England
as
my
Canaan."
"Well,
well
ere
long
I
shall
pay
you
another
visit;
good
evening
now,"
and
I
left
her
rather
abruptly;
I
had
much
ado
to
resist
a
strong
inward
impulse,
urging
me
to
take
a
warmer,
more
expressive
leave:
what
so
natural
as
to
fold
her
for
a
moment
in
a
close
embrace,
to
imprint
one
kiss
on
her
cheek
or
forehead?
I
was
not
unreasonable
that
was
all
I
wanted;
satisfied
in
that
point,
I
could
go
away
content;
and
Reason
denied
me
even
this;
she
ordered
me
to
turn
my
eyes
from
her
face,
and
my
steps
from
her
apartment
to
quit
her
as
dryly
and
coldly
as
I
would
have
quitted
old
Madame
Pelet.
I
obeyed,
but
I
swore
rancorously
to
be
avenged
one
day.
"I'll
earn
a
right
to
do
as
I
please
in
this
matter,
or
I'll
die
in
the
contest.
I
have
one
object
before
me
now
to
get
that
Genevese
girl
for
my
wife;
and
my
wife
she
shall
be
that
is,
provided
she
has
as
much,
or
half
as
much
regard
for
her
master
as
he
has
for
her.
And
would
she
be
so
docile,
so
smiling,
so
happy
under
my
instructions
if
she
had
not?
would
she
sit
at
my
side
when
I
dictate
or
correct,
with
such
a
still,
contented,
halcyon
mien?"
for
I
had
ever
remarked,
that
however
sad
or
harassed
her
countenance
might
be
when
I
entered
a
room,
yet
after
I
had
been
near
her,
spoken
to
her
a
few
words,
given
her
some
directions,
uttered
perhaps
some
reproofs,
she
would,
all
at
once,
nestle
into
a
nook
of
happiness,
and
look
up
serene
and
revived.
The
reproofs
suited
her
best
of
all:
while
I
scolded
she
would
chip
away
with
her
pen
knife
at
a
pencil
or
a
pen;
fidgetting
a
little,
pouting
a
little,
defending
herself
by
monosyllables,
and
when
I
deprived
her
of
the
pen
or
pencil,
fearing
it
would
be
all
cut
away,
and
when
I
interdicted
even
the
monosyllabic
defence,
for
the
purpose
of
working
up
the
subdued
excitement
a
little
higher,
she
would
at
last
raise
her
eyes
and
give
me
a
certain
glance,
sweetened
with
gaiety,
and
pointed
with
defiance,
which,
to
speak
truth,
thrilled
me
as
nothing
had
ever
done,
and
made
me,
in
a
fashion
(though
happily
she
did
not
know
it),
her
subject,
if
not
her
slave.
After
such
little
scenes
her
spirits
would
maintain
their
flow,
often
for
some
hours,
and,
as
I
remarked
before,
her
health
therefrom
took
a
sustenance
and
vigour
which,
previously
to
the
event
of
her
aunt's
death
and
her
dismissal,
had
almost
recreated
her
whole
frame.
It
has
taken
me
several
minutes
to
write
these
last
sentences;
but
I
had
thought
all
their
purport
during
the
brief
interval
of
descending
the
stairs
from
Frances'
room.
Just
as
I
was
opening
the
outer
door,
I
remembered
the
twenty
francs
which
I
had
not
restored;
I
paused:
impossible
to
carry
them
away
with
me;
difficult
to
force
them
back
on
their
original
owner;
I
had
now
seen
her
in
her
own
humble
abode,
witnessed
the
dignity
of
her
poverty,
the
pride
of
order,
the
fastidious
care
of
conservatism,
obvious
in
the
arrangement
and
economy
of
her
little
home;
I
was
sure
she
would
not
suffer
herself
to
be
excused
paying
her
debts;
I
was
certain
the
favour
of
indemnity
would
be
accepted
from
no
hand,
perhaps
least
of
all
from
mine:
yet
these
four
five
franc
pieces
were
a
burden
to
my
self
respect,
and
I
must
get
rid
of
them.
An
expedient
a
clumsy
one
no
doubt,
but
the
best
I
could
devise
suggested
itself
to
me.
I
darted
up
the
stairs,
knocked,
re
entered
the
room
as
if
in
haste:
"Mademoiselle,
I
have
forgotten
one
of
my
gloves;
I
must
have
left
it
here."
She
instantly
rose
to
seek
it;
as
she
turned
her
back,
I
being
now
at
the
hearth
noiselessly
lifted
a
little
vase,
one
of
a
set
of
china
ornaments,
as
old
fashioned
as
the
tea
cups
slipped
the
money
under
it,
then
saying
"Oh
here
is
my
glove!
I
had
dropped
it
within
the
fender;
good
evening,
mademoiselle,"
I
made
my
second
exit.
Brief
as
my
impromptu
return
had
been,
it
had
afforded
me
time
to
pick
up
a
heart
ache;
I
remarked
that
Frances
had
already
removed
the
red
embers
of
her
cheerful
little
fire
from
the
grate:
forced
to
calculate
every
item,
to
save
in
every
detail,
she
had
instantly
on
my
departure
retrenched
a
luxury
too
expensive
to
be
enjoyed
alone.
"I
am
glad
it
is
not
yet
winter,"
thought
I;
"but
in
two
months
more
come
the
winds
and
rains
of
November;
would
to
God
that
before
then
I
could
earn
the
right,
and
the
power,
to
shovel
coals
into
that
grate
AD
LIBITUM!"
Already
the
pavement
was
drying;
a
balmy
and
fresh
breeze
stirred
the
air,
purified
by
lightning;
I
felt
the
West
behind
me,
where
spread
a
sky
like
opal;
azure
immingled
with
crimson:
the
enlarged
sun,
glorious
in
Tyrian
tints,
dipped
his
brim
already;
stepping,
as
I
was,
eastward,
I
faced
a
vast
bank
of
clouds,
but
also
I
had
before
me
the
arch
of
an
evening
rainbow;
a
perfect
rainbow
high,
wide,
vivid.
I
looked
long;
my
eye
drank
in
the
scene,
and
I
suppose
my
brain
must
have
absorbed
it;
for
that
night,
after
lying
awake
in
pleasant
fever
a
long
time,
watching
the
silent
sheet
lightning,
which
still
played
among
the
retreating
clouds,
and
flashed
silvery
over
the
stars,
I
at
last
fell
asleep;
and
then
in
a
dream
were
reproduced
the
setting
sun,
the
bank
of
clouds,
the
mighty
rainbow.
I
stood,
methought,
on
a
terrace;
I
leaned
over
a
parapeted
wall;
there
was
space
below
me,
depth
I
could
not
fathom,
but
hearing
an
endless
dash
of
waves,
I
believed
it
to
be
the
sea;
sea
spread
to
the
horizon;
sea
of
changeful
green
and
intense
blue:
all
was
soft
in
the
distance;
all
vapour
veiled.
A
spark
of
gold
glistened
on
the
line
between
water
and
air,
floated
up,
approached,
enlarged,
changed;
the
object
hung
midway
between
heaven
and
earth,
under
the
arch
of
the
rainbow;
the
soft
but
dusk
clouds
diffused
behind.
It
hovered
as
on
wings;
pearly,
fleecy,
gleaming
air
streamed
like
raiment
round
it;
light,
tinted
with
carnation,
coloured
what
seemed
face
and
limbs;
a
large
star
shone
with
still
lustre
on
an
angel's
forehead;
an
upraised
arm
and
hand,
glancing
like
a
ray,
pointed
to
the
bow
overhead,
and
a
voice
in
my
heart
whispered
"Hope
smiles
on
Effort!"
A
COMPETENCY
was
what
I
wanted;
a
competency
it
was
now
my
aim
and
resolve
to
secure;
but
never
had
I
been
farther
from
the
mark.
With
August
the
school
year
(l'annee
scolaire)
closed,
the
examinations
concluded,
the
prizes
were
adjudged,
the
schools
dispersed,
the
gates
of
all
colleges,
the
doors
of
all
pensionnats
shut,
not
to
be
reopened
till
the
beginning
or
middle
of
October.
The
last
day
of
August
was
at
hand,
and
what
was
my
position?
Had
I
advanced
a
step
since
the
commencement
of
the
past
quarter?
On
the
contrary,
I
had
receded
one.
By
renouncing
my
engagement
as
English
master
in
Mdlle.
Reuter's
establishment,
I
had
voluntarily
cut
off
20l.
from
my
yearly
income;
I
had
diminished
my
60l.
per
annum
to
40l.,
and
even
that
sum
I
now
held
by
a
very
precarious
tenure.
It
is
some
time
since
I
made
any
reference
to
M.
Pelet.
The
moonlight
walk
is,
I
think,
the
last
incident
recorded
in
this
narrative
where
that
gentleman
cuts
any
conspicuous
figure:
the
fact
is,
since
that
event,
a
change
had
come
over
the
spirit
of
our
intercourse.
He,
indeed,
ignorant
that
the
still
hour,
a
cloudless
moon,
and
an
open
lattice,
had
revealed
to
me
the
secret
of
his
selfish
love
and
false
friendship,
would
have
continued
smooth
and
complaisant
as
ever;
but
I
grew
spiny
as
a
porcupine,
and
inflexible
as
a
blackthorn
cudgel;
I
never
had
a
smile
for
his
raillery,
never
a
moment
for
his
society;
his
invitations
to
take
coffee
with
him
in
his
parlour
were
invariably
rejected,
and
very
stiffly
and
sternly
rejected
too;
his
jesting
allusions
to
the
directress
(which
he
still
continued)
were
heard
with
a
grim
calm
very
different
from
the
petulant
pleasure
they
were
formerly
wont
to
excite.
For
a
long
time
Pelet
bore
with
my
frigid
demeanour
very
patiently;
he
even
increased
his
attentions;
but
finding
that
even
a
cringing
politeness
failed
to
thaw
or
move
me,
he
at
last
altered
too;
in
his
turn
he
cooled;
his
invitations
ceased;
his
countenance
became
suspicious
and
overcast,
and
I
read
in
the
perplexed
yet
brooding
aspect
of
his
brow,
a
constant
examination
and
comparison
of
premises,
and
an
anxious
endeavour
to
draw
thence
some
explanatory
inference.
Ere
long,
I
fancy,
he
succeeded,
for
he
was
not
without
penetration;
perhaps,
too,
Mdlle.
Zoraide
might
have
aided
him
in
the
solution
of
the
enigma;
at
any
rate
I
soon
found
that
the
uncertainty
of
doubt
had
vanished
from
his
manner;
renouncing
all
pretence
of
friendship
and
cordiality,
he
adopted
a
reserved,
formal,
but
still
scrupulously
polite
deportment.
This
was
the
point
to
which
I
had
wished
to
bring
him,
and
I
was
now
again
comparatively
at
my
ease.
I
did
not,
it
is
true,
like
my
position
in
his
house;
but
being
freed
from
the
annoyance
of
false
professions
and
double
dealing
I
could
endure
it,
especially
as
no
heroic
sentiment
of
hatred
or
jealousy
of
the
director
distracted
my
philosophical
soul;
he
had
not,
I
found,
wounded
me
in
a
very
tender
point,
the
wound
was
so
soon
and
so
radically
healed,
leaving
only
a
sense
of
contempt
for
the
treacherous
fashion
in
which
it
had
been
inflicted,
and
a
lasting
mistrust
of
the
hand
which
I
had
detected
attempting
to
stab
in
the
dark.
This
state
of
things
continued
till
about
the
middle
of
July,
and
then
there
was
a
little
change;
Pelet
came
home
one
night,
an
hour
after
his
usual
time,
in
a
state
of
unequivocal
intoxication,
a
thing
anomalous
with
him;
for
if
he
had
some
of
the
worst
faults
of
his
countrymen,
he
had
also
one
at
least
of
their
virtues,
i.e.
sobriety.
So
drunk,
however,
was
he
upon
this
occasion,
that
after
having
roused
the
whole
establishment
(except
the
pupils,
whose
dormitory
being
over
the
classes
in
a
building
apart
from
the
dwelling
house,
was
consequently
out
of
the
reach
of
disturbance)
by
violently
ringing
the
hall
bell
and
ordering
lunch
to
be
brought
in
immediately,
for
he
imagined
it
was
noon,
whereas
the
city
bells
had
just
tolled
midnight;
after
having
furiously
rated
the
servants
for
their
want
of
punctuality,
and
gone
near
to
chastise
his
poor
old
mother,
who
advised
him
to
go
to
bed,
he
began
raving
dreadfully
about
"le
maudit
Anglais,
Creemsvort."
I
had
not
yet
retired;
some
German
books
I
had
got
hold
of
had
kept
me
up
late;
I
heard
the
uproar
below,
and
could
distinguish
the
director's
voice
exalted
in
a
manner
as
appalling
as
it
was
unusual.
Opening
my
door
a
little,
I
became
aware
of
a
demand
on
his
part
for
"Creemsvort"
to
be
brought
down
to
him
that
he
might
cut
his
throat
on
the
hall
table
and
wash
his
honour,
which
he
affirmed
to
be
in
a
dirty
condition,
in
infernal
British
blood.
"He
is
either
mad
or
drunk,"
thought
I,
"and
in
either
case
the
old
woman
and
the
servants
will
be
the
better
of
a
man's
assistance,"
so
I
descended
straight
to
the
hall.
I
found
him
staggering
about,
his
eyes
in
a
fine
frenzy
rolling
a
pretty
sight
he
was,
a
just
medium
between
the
fool
and
the
lunatic.
"Come,
M.
Pelet,"
said
I,
"you
had
better
go
to
bed,"
and
I
took
hold
of
his
arm.
His
excitement,
of
course,
increased
greatly
at
sight
and
touch
of
the
individual
for
whose
blood
he
had
been
making
application:
he
struggled
and
struck
with
fury
but
a
drunken
man
is
no
match
for
a
sober
one;
and,
even
in
his
normal
state,
Pelet's
worn
out
frame
could
not
have
stood
against
my
sound
one.
I
got
him
up
stairs,
and,
in
process
of
time,
to
bed.
During
the
operation
he
did
not
fail
to
utter
comminations
which,
though
broken,
had
a
sense
in
them;
while
stigmatizing
me
as
the
treacherous
spawn
of
a
perfidious
country,
he,
in
the
same
breath,
anathematized
Zoraide
Reuter;
he
termed
her
"femme
sotte
et
vicieuse,"
who,
in
a
fit
of
lewd
caprice,
had
thrown
herself
away
on
an
unprincipled
adventurer;
directing
the
point
of
the
last
appellation
by
a
furious
blow,
obliquely
aimed
at
me.
I
left
him
in
the
act
of
bounding
elastically
out
of
the
bed
into
which
I
had
tucked
him;
but,
as
I
took
the
precaution
of
turning
the
key
in
the
door
behind
me,
I
retired
to
my
own
room,
assured
of
his
safe
custody
till
the
morning,
and
free
to
draw
undisturbed
conclusions
from
the
scene
I
had
just
witnessed.
Now,
it
was
precisely
about
this
time
that
the
directress,
stung
by
my
coldness,
bewitched
by
my
scorn,
and
excited
by
the
preference
she
suspected
me
of
cherishing
for
another,
had
fallen
into
a
snare
of
her
own
laying
was
herself
caught
in
the
meshes
of
the
very
passion
with
which
she
wished
to
entangle
me.
Conscious
of
the
state
of
things
in
that
quarter,
I
gathered,
from
the
condition
in
which
I
saw
my
employer,
that
his
lady
love
had
betrayed
the
alienation
of
her
affections
inclinations,
rather,
I
would
say;
affection
is
a
word
at
once
too
warm
and
too
pure
for
the
subject
had
let
him
see
that
the
cavity
of
her
hollow
heart,
emptied
of
his
image,
was
now
occupied
by
that
of
his
usher.
It
was
not
without
some
surprise
that
I
found
myself
obliged
to
entertain
this
view
of
the
case;
Pelet,
with
his
old
established
school,
was
so
convenient,
so
profitable
a
match
Zoraide
was
so
calculating,
so
interested
a
woman
I
wondered
mere
personal
preference
could,
in
her
mind,
have
prevailed
for
a
moment
over
worldly
advantage:
yet,
it
was
evident,
from
what
Pelet
said,
that,
not
only
had
she
repulsed
him,
but
had
even
let
slip
expressions
of
partiality
for
me.
One
of
his
drunken
exclamations
was,
"And
the
jade
doats
on
your
youth,
you
raw
blockhead!
and
talks
of
your
noble
deportment,
as
she
calls
your
accursed
English
formality
and
your
pure
morals,
forsooth!
des
moeurs
de
Caton
a
t
elle
dit
sotte!"
Hers,
I
thought,
must
be
a
curious
soul,
where
in
spite
of
a
strong,
natural
tendency
to
estimate
unduly
advantages
of
wealth
and
station,
the
sardonic
disdain
of
a
fortuneless
subordinate
had
wrought
a
deeper
impression
than
could
be
imprinted
by
the
most
flattering
assiduities
of
a
prosperous
CHEF
D'INSTITUTION.
I
smiled
inwardly;
and
strange
to
say,
though
my
AMOUR
PROPRE
was
excited
not
disagreeably
by
the
conquest,
my
better
feelings
remained
untouched.
Next
day,
when
I
saw
the
directress,
and
when
she
made
an
excuse
to
meet
me
in
the
corridor,
and
besought
my
notice
by
a
demeanour
and
look
subdued
to
Helot
humility,
I
could
not
love,
I
could
scarcely
pity
her.
To
answer
briefly
and
dryly
some
interesting
inquiry
about
my
health
to
pass
her
by
with
a
stern
bow
was
all
I
could;
her
presence
and
manner
had
then,
and
for
some
time
previously
and
consequently,
a
singular
effect
upon
me:
they
sealed
up
all
that
was
good
elicited
all
that
was
noxious
in
my
nature;
sometimes
they
enervated
my
senses,
but
they
always
hardened
my
heart.
I
was
aware
of
the
detriment
done,
and
quarrelled
with
myself
for
the
change.
I
had
ever
hated
a
tyrant;
and,
behold,
the
possession
of
a
slave,
self
given,
went
near
to
transform
me
into
what
I
abhorred!
There
was
at
once
a
sort
of
low
gratification
in
receiving
this
luscious
incense
from
an
attractive
and
still
young
worshipper;
and
an
irritating
sense
of
degradation
in
the
very
experience
of
the
pleasure.
When
she
stole
about
me
with
the
soft
step
of
a
slave,
I
felt
at
once
barbarous
and
sensual
as
a
pasha.
I
endured
her
homage
sometimes;
sometimes
I
rebuked
it.
My
indifference
or
harshness
served
equally
to
increase
the
evil
I
desired
to
check.
"Que
le
dedain
lui
sied
bien!"
I
once
overheard
her
say
to
her
mother:
"il
est
beau
comme
Apollon
quand
il
sourit
de
son
air
hautain."
And
the
jolly
old
dame
laughed,
and
said
she
thought
her
daughter
was
bewitched,
for
I
had
no
point
of
a
handsome
man
about
me,
except
being
straight
and
without
deformity.
"Pour
moi,"
she
continued,
"il
me
fait
tout
l'effet
d'un
chat
huant,
avec
ses
besicles."
Worthy
old
girl!
I
could
have
gone
and
kissed
her
had
she
not
been
a
little
too
old,
too
fat,
and
too
red
faced;
her
sensible,
truthful
words
seemed
so
wholesome,
contrasted
with
the
morbid
illusions
of
her
daughter.
When
Pelet
awoke
on
the
morning
after
his
frenzy
fit,
he
retained
no
recollection
of
what
had
happened
the
previous
night,
and
his
mother
fortunately
had
the
discretion
to
refrain
from
informing
him
that
I
had
been
a
witness
of
his
degradation.
He
did
not
again
have
recourse
to
wine
for
curing
his
griefs,
but
even
in
his
sober
mood
he
soon
showed
that
the
iron
of
jealousy
had
entered
into
his
soul.
A
thorough
Frenchman,
the
national
characteristic
of
ferocity
had
not
been
omitted
by
nature
in
compounding
the
ingredients
of
his
character;
it
had
appeared
first
in
his
access
of
drunken
wrath,
when
some
of
his
demonstrations
of
hatred
to
my
person
were
of
a
truly
fiendish
character,
and
now
it
was
more
covertly
betrayed
by
momentary
contractions
of
the
features,
and
flashes
of
fierceness
in
his
light
blue
eyes,
when
their
glance
chanced
to
encounter
mine.
He
absolutely
avoided
speaking
to
me;
I
was
now
spared
even
the
falsehood
of
his
politeness.
In
this
state
of
our
mutual
relations,
my
soul
rebelled
sometimes
almost
ungovernably,
against
living
in
the
house
and
discharging
the
service
of
such
a
man;
but
who
is
free
from
the
constraint
of
circumstances?
At
that
time,
I
was
not:
I
used
to
rise
each
morning
eager
to
shake
off
his
yoke,
and
go
out
with
my
portmanteau
under
my
arm,
if
a
beggar,
at
least
a
freeman;
and
in
the
evening,
when
I
came
back
from
the
pensionnat
de
demoiselles,
a
certain
pleasant
voice
in
my
ear;
a
certain
face,
so
intelligent,
yet
so
docile,
so
reflective,
yet
so
soft,
in
my
eyes;
a
certain
cast
of
character,
at
once
proud
and
pliant,
sensitive
and
sagacious,
serious
and
ardent,
in
my
head;
a
certain
tone
of
feeling,
fervid
and
modest,
refined
and
practical,
pure
and
powerful,
delighting
and
troubling
my
memory
visions
of
new
ties
I
longed
to
contract,
of
new
duties
I
longed
to
undertake,
had
taken
the
rover
and
the
rebel
out
of
me,
and
had
shown
endurance
of
my
hated
lot
in
the
light
of
a
Spartan
virtue.
But
Pelet's
fury
subsided;
a
fortnight
sufficed
for
its
rise,
progress,
and
extinction:
in
that
space
of
time
the
dismissal
of
the
obnoxious
teacher
had
been
effected
in
the
neighbouring
house,
and
in
the
same
interval
I
had
declared
my
resolution
to
follow
and
find
out
my
pupil,
and
upon
my
application
for
her
address
being
refused,
I
had
summarily
resigned
my
own
post.
This
last
act
seemed
at
once
to
restore
Mdlle.
Reuter
to
her
senses;
her
sagacity,
her
judgment,
so
long
misled
by
a
fascinating
delusion,
struck
again
into
the
right
track
the
moment
that
delusion
vanished.
By
the
right
track,
I
do
not
mean
the
steep
and
difficult
path
of
principle
in
that
path
she
never
trod;
but
the
plain
highway
of
common
sense,
from
which
she
had
of
late
widely
diverged.
When
there
she
carefully
sought,
and
having
found,
industriously
pursued
the
trail
of
her
old
suitor,
M.
Pelet.
She
soon
overtook
him.
What
arts
she
employed
to
soothe
and
blind
him
I
know
not,
but
she
succeeded
both
in
allaying
his
wrath,
and
hoodwinking
his
discernment,
as
was
soon
proved
by
the
alteration
in
his
mien
and
manner;
she
must
have
managed
to
convince
him
that
I
neither
was,
nor
ever
had
been,
a
rival
of
his,
for
the
fortnight
of
fury
against
me
terminated
in
a
fit
of
exceeding
graciousness
and
amenity,
not
unmixed
with
a
dash
of
exulting
self
complacency,
more
ludicrous
than
irritating.
Pelet's
bachelor's
life
had
been
passed
in
proper
French
style
with
due
disregard
to
moral
restraint,
and
I
thought
his
married
life
promised
to
be
very
French
also.
He
often
boasted
to
me
what
a
terror
he
had
been
to
certain
husbands
of
his
acquaintance;
I
perceived
it
would
not
now
be
difficult
to
pay
him
back
in
his
own
coin.
The
crisis
drew
on.
No
sooner
had
the
holidays
commenced
than
note
of
preparation
for
some
momentous
event
sounded
all
through
the
premises
of
Pelet:
painters,
polishers,
and
upholsterers
were
immediately
set
to
work,
and
there
was
talk
of
"la
chambre
de
Madame,"
"le
salon
de
Madame."
Not
deeming
it
probable
that
the
old
duenna
at
present
graced
with
that
title
in
our
house,
had
inspired
her
son
with
such
enthusiasm
of
filial
piety,
as
to
induce
him
to
fit
up
apartments
expressly
for
her
use,
I
concluded,
in
common
with
the
cook,
the
two
housemaids,
and
the
kitchen
scullion,
that
a
new
and
more
juvenile
Madame
was
destined
to
be
the
tenant
of
these
gay
chambers.
Presently
official
announcement
of
the
coming
event
was
put
forth.
In
another
week's
time
M.
Francois
Pelet,
directeur,
and
Mdlle.
Zoraide
Reuter,
directrice,
were
to
be
joined
together
in
the
bands
of
matrimony.
Monsieur,
in
person,
heralded
the
fact
to
me;
terminating
his
communication
by
an
obliging
expression
of
his
desire
that
I
should
continue,
as
heretofore,
his
ablest
assistant
and
most
trusted
friend;
and
a
proposition
to
raise
my
salary
by
an
additional
two
hundred
francs
per
annum.
I
thanked
him,
gave
no
conclusive
answer
at
the
time,
and,
when
he
had
left
me,
threw
off
my
blouse,
put
on
my
coat,
and
set
out
on
a
long
walk
outside
the
Porte
de
Flandre,
in
order,
as
I
thought,
to
cool
my
blood,
calm
my
nerves,
and
shake
my
disarranged
ideas
into
some
order.
In
fact,
I
had
just
received
what
was
virtually
my
dismissal.
I
could
not
conceal,
I
did
not
desire
to
conceal
from
myself
the
conviction
that,
being
now
certain
that
Mdlle.
Reuter
was
destined
to
become
Madame
Pelet
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
remain
a
dependent
dweller
in
the
house
which
was
soon
to
be
hers.
Her
present
demeanour
towards
me
was
deficient
neither
in
dignity
nor
propriety;
but
I
knew
her
former
feeling
was
unchanged.
Decorum
now
repressed,
and
Policy
masked
it,
but
Opportunity
would
be
too
strong
for
either
of
these
Temptation
would
shiver
their
restraints.
I
was
no
pope
I
could
not
boast
infallibility:
in
short,
if
I
stayed,
the
probability
was
that,
in
three
months'
time,
a
practical
modern
French
novel
would
be
in
full
process
of
concoction
under
the
roof
of
the
unsuspecting
Pelet.
Now,
modern
French
novels
are
not
to
my
taste,
either
practically
or
theoretically.
Limited
as
had
yet
been
my
experience
of
life,
I
had
once
had
the
opportunity
of
contemplating,
near
at
hand,
an
example
of
the
results
produced
by
a
course
of
interesting
and
romantic
domestic
treachery.
No
golden
halo
of
fiction
was
about
this
example,
I
saw
it
bare
and
real,
and
it
was
very
loathsome.
I
saw
a
mind
degraded
by
the
practice
of
mean
subterfuge,
by
the
habit
of
perfidious
deception,
and
a
body
depraved
by
the
infectious
influence
of
the
vice
polluted
soul.
I
had
suffered
much
from
the
forced
and
prolonged
view
of
this
spectacle;
those
sufferings
I
did
not
now
regret,
for
their
simple
recollection
acted
as
a
most
wholesome
antidote
to
temptation.
They
had
inscribed
on
my
reason
the
conviction
that
unlawful
pleasure,
trenching
on
another's
rights,
is
delusive
and
envenomed
pleasure
its
hollowness
disappoints
at
the
time,
its
poison
cruelly
tortures
afterwards,
its
effects
deprave
for
ever.
From
all
this
resulted
the
conclusion
that
I
must
leave
Pelet's,
and
that
instantly;
"but,"
said
Prudence,
"you
know
not
where
to
go,
nor
how
to
live;"
and
then
the
dream
of
true
love
came
over
me:
Frances
Henri
seemed
to
stand
at
my
side;
her
slender
waist
to
invite
my
arm;
her
hand
to
court
my
hand;
I
felt
it
was
made
to
nestle
in
mine;
I
could
not
relinquish
my
right
to
it,
nor
could
I
withdraw
my
eyes
for
ever
from
hers,
where
I
saw
so
much
happiness,
such
a
correspondence
of
heart
with
heart;
over
whose
expression
I
had
such
influence;
where
I
could
kindle
bliss,
infuse
awe,
stir
deep
delight,
rouse
sparkling
spirit,
and
sometimes
waken
pleasurable
dread.
My
hopes
to
will
and
possess,
my
resolutions
to
merit
and
rise,
rose
in
array
against
me;
and
here
I
was
about
to
plunge
into
the
gulf
of
absolute
destitution;
"and
all
this,"
suggested
an
inward
voice,
"because
you
fear
an
evil
which
may
never
happen!"
"It
will
happen;
you
KNOW
it
will,"
answered
that
stubborn
monitor,
Conscience.
"Do
what
you
feel
is
right;
obey
me,
and
even
in
the
sloughs
of
want
I
will
plant
for
you
firm
footing."
And
then,
as
I
walked
fast
along
the
road,
there
rose
upon
me
a
strange,
inly
felt
idea
of
some
Great
Being,
unseen,
but
all
present,
who
in
His
beneficence
desired
only
my
welfare,
and
now
watched
the
struggle
of
good
and
evil
in
my
heart,
and
waited
to
see
whether
I
should
obey
His
voice,
heard
in
the
whispers
of
my
conscience,
or
lend
an
ear
to
the
sophisms
by
which
His
enemy
and
mine
the
Spirit
of
Evil
sought
to
lead
me
astray.
Rough
and
steep
was
the
path
indicated
by
divine
suggestion;
mossy
and
declining
the
green
way
along
which
Temptation
strewed
flowers;
but
whereas,
methought,
the
Deity
of
Love,
the
Friend
of
all
that
exists,
would
smile
well
pleased
were
I
to
gird
up
my
loins
and
address
myself
to
the
rude
ascent;
so,
on
the
other
hand,
each
inclination
to
the
velvet
declivity
seemed
to
kindle
a
gleam
of
triumph
on
the
brow
of
the
man
hating,
God
defying
demon.
Sharp
and
short
I
turned
round;
fast
I
retraced
my
steps;
in
half
an
hour
I
was
again
at
M.
Pelet's:
I
sought
him
in
his
study;
brief
parley,
concise
explanation
sufficed;
my
manner
proved
that
I
was
resolved;
he,
perhaps,
at
heart
approved
my
decision.
After
twenty
minutes'
conversation,
I
re
entered
my
own
room,
self
deprived
of
the
means
of
living,
self
sentenced
to
leave
my
present
home,
with
the
short
notice
of
a
week
in
which
to
provide
another.
DIRECTLY
as
I
closed
the
door,
I
saw
laid
on
the
table
two
letters;
my
thought
was,
that
they
were
notes
of
invitation
from
the
friends
of
some
of
my
pupils;
I
had
received
such
marks
of
attention
occasionally,
and
with
me,
who
had
no
friends,
correspondence
of
more
interest
was
out
of
the
question;
the
postman's
arrival
had
never
yet
been
an
event
of
interest
to
me
since
I
came
to
Brussels.
I
laid
my
hand
carelessly
on
the
documents,
and
coldly
and
slowly
glancing
at
them,
I
prepared
to
break
the
seals;
my
eye
was
arrested
and
my
hand
too;
I
saw
what
excited
me,
as
if
I
had
found
a
vivid
picture
where
I
expected
only
to
discover
a
blank
page:
on
one
cover
was
an
English
postmark;
on
the
other,
a
lady's
clear,
fine
autograph;
the
last
I
opened
first:
"MONSIEUR,
"I
FOUND
out
what
you
had
done
the
very
morning
after
your
visit
to
me;
you
might
be
sure
I
should
dust
the
china,
every
day;
and,
as
no
one
but
you
had
been
in
my
room
for
a
week,
and
as
fairy
money
is
not
current
in
Brussels,
I
could
not
doubt
who
left
the
twenty
francs
on
the
chimney
piece.
I
thought
I
heard
you
stir
the
vase
when
I
was
stooping
to
look
for
your
glove
under
the
table,
and
I
wondered
you
should
imagine
it
had
got
into
such
a
little
cup.
Now,
monsieur,
the
money
is
not
mine,
and
I
shall
not
keep
it;
I
will
not
send
it
in
this
note
because
it
might
be
lost
besides,
it
is
heavy;
but
I
will
restore
it
to
you
the
first
time
I
see
you,
and
you
must
make
no
difficulties
about
taking
it;
because,
in
the
first
place,
I
am
sure,
monsieur,
you
can
understand
that
one
likes
to
pay
one's
debts;
that
it
is
satisfactory
to
owe
no
man
anything;
and,
in
the
second
place,
I
can
now
very
well
afford
to
be
honest,
as
I
am
provided
with
a
situation.
This
last
circumstance
is,
indeed,
the
reason
of
my
writing
to
you,
for
it
is
pleasant
to
communicate
good
news;
and,
in
these
days,
I
have
only
my
master
to
whom
I
can
tell
anything.
"A
week
ago,
monsieur,
I
was
sent
for
by
a
Mrs.
Wharton,
an
English
lady;
her
eldest
daughter
was
going
to
be
married,
and
some
rich
relation
having
made
her
a
present
of
a
veil
and
dress
in
costly
old
lace,
as
precious,
they
said,
almost
as
jewels,
but
a
little
damaged
by
time,
I
was
commissioned
to
put
them
in
repair.
I
had
to
do
it
at
the
house;
they
gave
me,
besides,
some
embroidery
to
complete,
and
nearly
a
week
elapsed
before
I
had
finished
everything.
While
I
worked,
Miss
Wharton
often
came
into
the
room
and
sat
with
me,
and
so
did
Mrs.
Wharton;
they
made
me
talk
English;
asked
how
I
had
learned
to
speak
it
so
well;
then
they
inquired
what
I
knew
besides
what
books
I
had
read;
soon
they
seemed
to
make
a
sort
of
wonder
of
me,
considering
me
no
doubt
as
a
learned
grisette.
One
afternoon,
Mrs.
Wharton
brought
in
a
Parisian
lady
to
test
the
accuracy
of
my
knowledge
of
French;
the
result
of
it
was
that,
owing
probably
in
a
great
degree
to
the
mother's
and
daughter's
good
humour
about
the
marriage,
which
inclined
them
to
do
beneficent
deeds,
and
partly,
I
think,
because
they
are
naturally
benevolent
people,
they
decided
that
the
wish
I
had
expressed
to
do
something
more
than
mend
lace
was
a
very
legitimate
one;
and
the
same
day
they
took
me
in
their
carriage
to
Mrs.
D.'s,
who
is
the
directress
of
the
first
English
school
at
Brussels.
It
seems
she
happened
to
be
in
want
of
a
French
lady
to
give
lessons
in
geography,
history,
grammar,
and
composition,
in
the
French
language.
Mrs.
Wharton
recommended
me
very
warmly;
and,
as
two
of
her
younger
daughters
are
pupils
in
the
house,
her
patronage
availed
to
get
me
the
place.
It
was
settled
that
I
am
to
attend
six
hours
daily
(for,
happily,
it
was
not
required
that
I
should
live
in
the
house;
I
should
have
been
sorry
to
leave
my
lodgings),
and,
for
this,
Mrs.
D.
will
give
me
twelve
hundred
francs
per
annum.
"You
see,
therefore,
monsieur,
that
I
am
now
rich;
richer
almost
than
I
ever
hoped
to
be:
I
feel
thankful
for
it,
especially
as
my
sight
was
beginning
to
be
injured
by
constant
working
at
fine
lace;
and
I
was
getting,
too,
very
weary
of
sitting
up
late
at
nights,
and
yet
not
being
able
to
find
time
for
reading
or
study.
I
began
to
fear
that
I
should
fall
ill,
and
be
unable
to
pay
my
way;
this
fear
is
now,
in
a
great
measure,
removed;
and,
in
truth,
monsieur,
I
am
very
grateful
to
God
for
the
relief;
and
I
feel
it
necessary,
almost,
to
speak
of
my
happiness
to
some
one
who
is
kind
hearted
enough
to
derive
joy
from
seeing
others
joyful.
I
could
not,
therefore,
resist
the
temptation
of
writing
to
you;
I
argued
with
myself
it
is
very
pleasant
for
me
to
write,
and
it
will
not
be
exactly
painful,
though
it
may
be
tiresome
to
monsieur
to
read.
Do
not
be
too
angry
with
my
circumlocution
and
inelegancies
of
expression,
and,
believe
me
"Your
attached
pupil,
"F.
E.
HENRI."
Having
read
this
letter,
I
mused
on
its
contents
for
a
few
moments
whether
with
sentiments
pleasurable
or
otherwise
I
will
hereafter
note
and
then
took
up
the
other.
It
was
directed
in
a
hand
to
me
unknown
small,
and
rather
neat;
neither
masculine
nor
exactly
feminine;
the
seal
bore
a
coat
of
arms,
concerning
which
I
could
only
decipher
that
it
was
not
that
of
the
Seacombe
family,
consequently
the
epistle
could
be
from
none
of
my
almost
forgotten,
and
certainly
quite
forgetting
patrician
relations.
From
whom,
then,
was
it?
I
removed
the
envelope;
the
note
folded
within
ran
as
follows:
"I
have
no
doubt
in
the
world
that
you
are
doing
well
in
that
greasy
Flanders;
living
probably
on
the
fat
of
the
unctuous
land;
sitting
like
a
black
haired,
tawny
skinned,
long
nosed
Israelite
by
the
flesh
pots
of
Egypt;
or
like
a
rascally
son
of
Levi
near
the
brass
cauldrons
of
the
sanctuary,
and
every
now
and
then
plunging
in
a
consecrated
hook,
and
drawing
out
of
the
sea
of
broth
the
fattest
of
heave
shoulders
and
the
fleshiest
of
wave
breasts.
I
know
this,
because
you
never
write
to
any
one
in
England.
Thankless
dog
that
you
are!
I,
by
the
sovereign
efficacy
of
my
recommendation,
got
you
the
place
where
you
are
now
living
in
clover,
and
yet
not
a
word
of
gratitude,
or
even
acknowledgment,
have
you
ever
offered
in
return;
but
I
am
coming
to
see
you,
and
small
conception
can
you,
with
your
addled
aristocratic
brains,
form
of
the
sort
of
moral
kicking
I
have,
ready
packed
in
my
carpet
bag,
destined
to
be
presented
to
you
immediately
on
my
arrival.
"Meantime
I
know
all
about
your
affairs,
and
have
just
got
information,
by
Brown's
last
letter,
that
you
are
said
to
be
on
the
point
of
forming
an
advantageous
match
with
a
pursy,
little
Belgian
schoolmistress
a
Mdlle.
Zenobie,
or
some
such
name.
Won't
I
have
a
look
at
her
when
I
come
over!
And
this
you
may
rely
on:
if
she
pleases
my
taste,
or
if
I
think
it
worth
while
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view,
I'll
pounce
on
your
prize
and
bear
her
away
triumphant
in
spite
of
your
teeth.
Yet
I
don't
like
dumpies
either,
and
Brown
says
she
is
little
and
stout
the
better
fitted
for
a
wiry,
starved
looking
chap
like
you.
"Be
on
the
look
out,
for
you
know
neither
the
day
nor
hour
when
your
"
(I
don't
wish
to
blaspheme,
so
I'll
leave
a
blank)
cometh.
"Yours
truly,
"HUNSDEN
YORKE
HUNSDEN."
"Humph!"
said
I;
and
ere
I
laid
the
letter
down,
I
again
glanced
at
the
small,
neat
handwriting,
not
a
bit
like
that
of
a
mercantile
man,
nor,
indeed,
of
any
man
except
Hunsden
himself.
They
talk
of
affinities
between
the
autograph
and
the
character:
what
affinity
was
there
here?
I
recalled
the
writer's
peculiar
face
and
certain
traits
I
suspected,
rather
than
knew,
to
appertain
to
his
nature,
and
I
answered,
"A
great
deal."
Hunsden,
then,
was
coming
to
Brussels,
and
coming
I
knew
not
when;
coming
charged
with
the
expectation
of
finding
me
on
the
summit
of
prosperity,
about
to
be
married,
to
step
into
a
warm
nest,
to
lie
comfortably
down
by
the
side
of
a
snug,
well
fed
little
mate.
"I
wish
him
joy
of
the
fidelity
of
the
picture
he
has
painted,"
thought
I.
"What
will
he
say
when,
instead
of
a
pair
of
plump
turtle
doves,
billing
and
cooing
in
a
bower
of
roses,
he
finds
a
single
lean
cormorant,
standing
mateless
and
shelterless
on
poverty's
bleak
cliff?
Oh,
confound
him!
Let
him
come,
and
let
him
laugh
at
the
contrast
between
rumour
and
fact.
Were
he
the
devil
himself,
instead
of
being
merely
very
like
him,
I'd
not
condescend
to
get
out
of
his
way,
or
to
forge
a
smile
or
a
cheerful
word
wherewith
to
avert
his
sarcasm."
Then
I
recurred
to
the
other
letter:
that
struck
a
chord
whose
sound
I
could
not
deaden
by
thrusting
my
fingers
into
my
ears,
for
it
vibrated
within;
and
though
its
swell
might
be
exquisite
music,
its
cadence
was
a
groan.
That
Frances
was
relieved
from
the
pressure
of
want,
that
the
curse
of
excessive
labour
was
taken
off
her,
filled
me
with
happiness;
that
her
first
thought
in
prosperity
should
be
to
augment
her
joy
by
sharing
it
with
me,
met
and
satisfied
the
wish
of
my
heart.
Two
results
of
her
letter
were
then
pleasant,
sweet
as
two
draughts
of
nectar;
but
applying
my
lips
for
the
third
time
to
the
cup,
and
they
were
excoriated
as
with
vinegar
and
gall.
Two
persons
whose
desires
are
moderate
may
live
well
enough
in
Brussels
on
an
income
which
would
scarcely
afford
a
respectable
maintenance
for
one
in
London:
and
that,
not
because
the
necessaries
of
life
are
so
much
dearer
in
the
latter
capital,
or
taxes
so
much
higher
than
in
the
former,
but
because
the
English
surpass
in
folly
all
the
nations
on
God's
earth,
and
are
more
abject
slaves
to
custom,
to
opinion,
to
the
desire
to
keep
up
a
certain
appearance,
than
the
Italians
are
to
priestcraft,
the
French
to
vain
glory,
the
Russians
to
their
Czar,
or
the
Germans
to
black
beer.
I
have
seen
a
degree
of
sense
in
the
modest
arrangement
of
one
homely
Belgian
household,
that
might
put
to
shame
the
elegance,
the
superfluities,
the
luxuries,
the
strained
refinements
of
a
hundred
genteel
English
mansions.
In
Belgium,
provided
you
can
make
money,
you
may
save
it;
this
is
scarcely
possible
in
England;
ostentation
there
lavishes
in
a
month
what
industry
has
earned
in
a
year.
More
shame
to
all
classes
in
that
most
bountiful
and
beggarly
country
for
their
servile
following
of
Fashion;
I
could
write
a
chapter
or
two
on
this
subject,
but
must
forbear,
at
least
for
the
present.
Had
I
retained
my
60l.
per
annum
I
could,
now
that
Frances
was
in
possession
of
50l.,
have
gone
straight
to
her
this
very
evening,
and
spoken
out
the
words
which,
repressed,
kept
fretting
my
heart
with
fever;
our
united
income
would,
as
we
should
have
managed
it,
have
sufficed
well
for
our
mutual
support;
since
we
lived
in
a
country
where
economy
was
not
confounded
with
meanness,
where
frugality
in
dress,
food,
and
furniture,
was
not
synonymous
with
vulgarity
in
these
various
points.
But
the
placeless
usher,
bare
of
resource,
and
unsupported
by
connections,
must
not
think
of
this;
such
a
sentiment
as
love,
such
a
word
as
marriage,
were
misplaced
in
his
heart,
and
on
his
lips.
Now
for
the
first
time
did
I
truly
feel
what
it
was
to
be
poor;
now
did
the
sacrifice
I
had
made
in
casting
from
me
the
means
of
living
put
on
a
new
aspect;
instead
of
a
correct,
just,
honourable
act,
it
seemed
a
deed
at
once
light
and
fanatical;
I
took
several
turns
in
my
room,
under
the
goading
influence
of
most
poignant
remorse;
I
walked
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
the
wall
to
the
window;
and
at
the
window,
self
reproach
seemed
to
face
me;
at
the
wall,
self
disdain:
all
at
once
out
spoke
Conscience:
"Down,
stupid
tormenters!"
cried
she;
"the
man
has
done
his
duty;
you
shall
not
bait
him
thus
by
thoughts
of
what
might
have
been;
he
relinquished
a
temporary
and
contingent
good
to
avoid
a
permanent
and
certain
evil
he
did
well.
Let
him
reflect
now,
and
when
your
blinding
dust
and
deafening
hum
subside,
he
will
discover
a
path."
I
sat
down;
I
propped
my
forehead
on
both
my
hands;
I
thought
and
thought
an
hour
two
hours;
vainly.
I
seemed
like
one
sealed
in
a
subterranean
vault,
who
gazes
at
utter
blackness;
at
blackness
ensured
by
yard
thick
stone
walls
around,
and
by
piles
of
building
above,
expecting
light
to
penetrate
through
granite,
and
through
cement
firm
as
granite.
But
there
are
chinks,
or
there
may
be
chinks,
in
the
best
adjusted
masonry;
there
was
a
chink
in
my
cavernous
cell;
for,
eventually,
I
saw,
or
seemed
to
see,
a
ray
pallid,
indeed,
and
cold,
and
doubtful,
but
still
a
ray,
for
it
showed
that
narrow
path
which
conscience
had
promised
after
two,
three
hours'
torturing
research
in
brain
and
memory,
I
disinterred
certain
remains
of
circumstances,
and
conceived
a
hope
that
by
putting
them
together
an
expedient
might
be
framed,
and
a
resource
discovered.
The
circumstances
were
briefly
these:
Some
three
months
ago
M.
Pelet
had,
on
the
occasion
of
his
fete,
given
the
boys
a
treat,
which
treat
consisted
in
a
party
of
pleasure
to
a
certain
place
of
public
resort
in
the
outskirts
of
Brussels,
of
which
I
do
not
at
this
moment
remember
the
name,
but
near
it
were
several
of
those
lakelets
called
etangs;
and
there
was
one
etang,
larger
than
the
rest,
where
on
holidays
people
were
accustomed
to
amuse
themselves
by
rowing
round
it
in
little
boats.
The
boys
having
eaten
an
unlimited
quantity
of
"gaufres,"
and
drank
several
bottles
of
Louvain
beer,
amid
the
shades
of
a
garden
made
and
provided
for
such
crams,
petitioned
the
director
for
leave
to
take
a
row
on
the
etang.
Half
a
dozen
of
the
eldest
succeeded
in
obtaining
leave,
and
I
was
commissioned
to
accompany
them
as
surveillant.
Among
the
half
dozen
happened
to
be
a
certain
Jean
Baptiste
Vandenhuten,
a
most
ponderous
young
Flamand,
not
tall,
but
even
now,
at
the
early
age
of
sixteen,
possessing
a
breadth
and
depth
of
personal
development
truly
national.
It
chanced
that
Jean
was
the
first
lad
to
step
into
the
boat;
he
stumbled,
rolled
to
one
side,
the
boat
revolted
at
his
weight
and
capsized.
Vandenhuten
sank
like
lead,
rose,
sank
again.
My
coat
and
waistcoat
were
off
in
an
instant;
I
had
not
been
brought
up
at
Eton
and
boated
and
bathed
and
swam
there
ten
long
years
for
nothing;
it
was
a
natural
and
easy
act
for
me
to
leap
to
the
rescue.
The
lads
and
the
boatmen
yelled;
they
thought
there
would
be
two
deaths
by
drowning
instead
of
one;
but
as
Jean
rose
the
third
time,
I
clutched
him
by
one
leg
and
the
collar,
and
in
three
minutes
more
both
he
and
I
were
safe
landed.
To
speak
heaven's
truth,
my
merit
in
the
action
was
small
indeed,
for
I
had
run
no
risk,
and
subsequently
did
not
even
catch
cold
from
the
wetting;
but
when
M.
and
Madame
Vandenhuten,
of
whom
Jean
Baptiste
was
the
sole
hope,
came
to
hear
of
the
exploit,
they
seemed
to
think
I
had
evinced
a
bravery
and
devotion
which
no
thanks
could
sufficiently
repay.
Madame,
in
particular,
was
"certain
I
must
have
dearly
loved
their
sweet
son,
or
I
would
not
thus
have
hazarded
my
own
life
to
save
his."
Monsieur,
an
honest
looking,
though
phlegmatic
man,
said
very
little,
but
he
would
not
suffer
me
to
leave
the
room,
till
I
had
promised
that
in
case
I
ever
stood
in
need
of
help
I
would,
by
applying
to
him,
give
him
a
chance
of
discharging
the
obligation
under
which
he
affirmed
I
had
laid
him.
These
words,
then,
were
my
glimmer
of
light;
it
was
here
I
found
my
sole
outlet;
and
in
truth,
though
the
cold
light
roused,
it
did
not
cheer
me;
nor
did
the
outlet
seem
such
as
I
should
like
to
pass
through.
Right
I
had
none
to
M.
Vandenhuten's
good
offices;
it
was
not
on
the
ground
of
merit
I
could
apply
to
him;
no,
I
must
stand
on
that
of
necessity:
I
had
no
work;
I
wanted
work;
my
best
chance
of
obtaining
it
lay
in
securing
his
recommendation.
This
I
knew
could
be
had
by
asking
for
it;
not
to
ask,
because
the
request
revolted
my
pride
and
contradicted
my
habits,
would,
I
felt,
be
an
indulgence
of
false
and
indolent
fastidiousness.
I
might
repent
the
omission
all
my
life;
I
would
not
then
be
guilty
of
it.
That
evening
I
went
to
M.
Vandenhuten's;
but
I
had
bent
the
bow
and
adjusted
the
shaft
in
vain;
the
string
broke.
I
rang
the
bell
at
the
great
door
(it
was
a
large,
handsome
house
in
an
expensive
part
of
the
town);
a
manservant
opened;
I
asked
for
M.
Vandenhuten;
M.
Vandenhuten
and
family
were
all
out
of
town
gone
to
Ostend
did
not
know
when
they
would
be
back.
I
left
my
card,
and
retraced
my
steps.
A
WEEK
is
gone;
LE
JOUR
DES
NOCES
arrived;
the
marriage
was
solemnized
at
St.
Jacques;
Mdlle.
Zoraide
became
Madame
Pelet,
NEE
Reuter;
and,
in
about
an
hour
after
this
transformation,
"the
happy
pair,"
as
newspapers
phrase
it,
were
on
their
way
to
Paris;
where,
according
to
previous
arrangement,
the
honeymoon
was
to
be
spent.
The
next
day
I
quitted
the
pensionnat.
Myself
and
my
chattels
(some
books
and
clothes)
were
soon
transferred
to
a
modest
lodging
I
had
hired
in
a
street
not
far
off.
In
half
an
hour
my
clothes
were
arranged
in
a
commode,
my
books
on
a
shelf,
and
the
"flitting"
was
effected.
I
should
not
have
been
unhappy
that
day
had
not
one
pang
tortured
me
a
longing
to
go
to
the
Rue
Notre
Dame
aux
Neiges,
resisted,
yet
irritated
by
an
inward
resolve
to
avoid
that
street
till
such
time
as
the
mist
of
doubt
should
clear
from
my
prospects.
It
was
a
sweet
September
evening
very
mild,
very
still;
I
had
nothing
to
do;
at
that
hour
I
knew
Frances
would
be
equally
released
from
occupation;
I
thought
she
might
possibly
be
wishing
for
her
master,
I
knew
I
wished
for
my
pupil.
Imagination
began
with
her
low
whispers,
infusing
into
my
soul
the
soft
tale
of
pleasures
that
might
be.
"You
will
find
her
reading
or
writing,"
said
she;
"you
can
take
your
seat
at
her
side;
you
need
not
startle
her
peace
by
undue
excitement;
you
need
not
embarrass
her
manner
by
unusual
action
or
language.
Be
as
you
always
are;
look
over
what
she
has
written;
listen
while
she
reads;
chide
her,
or
quietly
approve;
you
know
the
effect
of
either
system;
you
know
her
smile
when
pleased,
you
know
the
play
of
her
looks
when
roused;
you
have
the
secret
of
awakening
what
expression
you
will,
and
you
can
choose
amongst
that
pleasant
variety.
With
you
she
will
sit
silent
as
long
as
it
suits
you
to
talk
alone;
you
can
hold
her
under
a
potent
spell:
intelligent
as
she
is,
eloquent
as
she
can
be,
you
can
seal
her
lips,
and
veil
her
bright
countenance
with
diffidence;
yet,
you
know,
she
is
not
all
monotonous
mildness;
you
have
seen,
with
a
sort
of
strange
pleasure,
revolt,
scorn,
austerity,
bitterness,
lay
energetic
claim
to
a
place
in
her
feelings
and
physiognomy;
you
know
that
few
could
rule
her
as
you
do;
you
know
she
might
break,
but
never
bend
under
the
hand
of
Tyranny
and
Injustice,
but
Reason
and
Affection
can
guide
her
by
a
sign.
Try
their
influence
now.
Go
they
are
not
passions;
you
may
handle
them
safely."
"I
will
NOT
go
was
my
answer
to
the
sweet
temptress.
A
man
is
master
of
himself
to
a
certain
point,
but
not
beyond
it.
Could
I
seek
Frances
to
night,
could
I
sit
with
her
alone
in
a
quiet
room,
and
address
her
only
in
the
language
of
Reason
and
Affection?"
"No,"
was
the
brief,
fervent
reply
of
that
Love
which
had
conquered
and
now
controlled
me.
Time
seemed
to
stagnate;
the
sun
would
not
go
down;
my
watch
ticked,
but
I
thought
the
hands
were
paralyzed.
"What
a
hot
evening!"
I
cried,
throwing
open
the
lattice;
for,
indeed,
I
had
seldom
felt
so
feverish.
Hearing
a
step
ascending
the
common
stair,
I
wondered
whether
the
"locataire,"
now
mounting
to
his
apartments,
were
as
unsettled
in
mind
and
condition
as
I
was,
or
whether
he
lived
in
the
calm
of
certain
resources,
and
in
the
freedom
of
unfettered
feelings.
What!
was
he
coming
in
person
to
solve
the
problem
hardly
proposed
in
inaudible
thought?
He
had
actually
knocked
at
the
door
at
MY
door;
a
smart,
prompt
rap;
and,
almost
before
I
could
invite
him
in,
he
was
over
the
threshold,
and
had
closed
the
door
behind
him.
"And
how
are
you?"
asked
an
indifferent,
quiet
voice,
in
the
English
language;
while
my
visitor,
without
any
sort
of
bustle
or
introduction,
put
his
hat
on
the
table,
and
his
gloves
into
his
hat,
and
drawing
the
only
armchair
the
room
afforded
a
little
forward,
seated
himself
tranquilly
therein.
"Can't
you
speak?"
he
inquired
in
a
few
moments,
in
a
tone
whose
nonchalance
seemed
to
intimate
that
it
was
much
the
same
thing
whether
I
answered
or
not.
The
fact
is,
I
found
it
desirable
to
have
recourse
to
my
good
friends
"les
besicles;"
not
exactly
to
ascertain
the
identity
of
my
visitor
for
I
already
knew
him,
confound
his
impudence!
but
to
see
how
he
looked
to
get
a
clear
notion
of
his
mien
and
countenance.
I
wiped
the
glasses
very
deliberately,
and
put
them
on
quite
as
deliberately;
adjusting
them
so
as
not
to
hurt
the
bridge
of
my
nose
or
get
entangled
in
my
short
tufts
of
dun
hair.
I
was
sitting
in
the
window
seat,
with
my
back
to
the
light,
and
I
had
him
VIS
A
VIS;
a
position
he
would
much
rather
have
had
reversed;
for,
at
any
time,
he
preferred
scrutinizing
to
being
scrutinized.
Yes,
it
was
HE,
and
no
mistake,
with
his
six
feet
of
length
arranged
in
a
sitting
attitude;
with
his
dark
travelling
surtout
with
its
velvet
collar,
his
gray
pantaloons,
his
black
stock,
and
his
face,
the
most
original
one
Nature
ever
modelled,
yet
the
least
obtrusively
so;
not
one
feature
that
could
be
termed
marked
or
odd,
yet
the
effect
of
the
whole
unique.
There
is
no
use
in
attempting
to
describe
what
is
indescribable.
Being
in
no
hurry
to
address
him,
I
sat
and
stared
at
my
ease.
"Oh,
that's
your
game
is
it?"
said
he
at
last.
"Well,
we'll
see
which
is
soonest
tired."
And
he
slowly
drew
out
a
fine
cigar
case,
picked
one
to
his
taste,
lit
it,
took
a
book
from
the
shelf
convenient
to
his
hand,
then
leaning
back,
proceeded
to
smoke
and
read
as
tranquilly
as
if
he
had
been
in
his
own
room,
in
Grove
street,
X
shire,
England.
I
knew
he
was
capable
of
continuing
in
that
attitude
till
midnight,
if
he
conceived
the
whim,
so
I
rose,
and
taking
the
book
from
his
hand,
I
said,
"You
did
not
ask
for
it,
and
you
shall
not
have
it."
"It
is
silly
and
dull,"
he
observed,
"so
I
have
not
lost
much;"
then
the
spell
being
broken,
he
went
on:
"I
thought
you
lived
at
Pelet's;
I
went
there
this
afternoon
expecting
to
be
starved
to
death
by
sitting
in
a
boarding
school
drawing
room,
and
they
told
me
you
were
gone,
had
departed
this
morning;
you
had
left
your
address
behind
you
though,
which
I
wondered
at;
it
was
a
more
practical
and
sensible
precaution
than
I
should
have
imagined
you
capable
of.
Why
did
you
leave?"
"Because
M.
Pelet
has
just
married
the
lady
whom
you
and
Mr.
Brown
assigned
to
me
as
my
wife."
"Oh,
indeed!"
replied
Hunsden
with
a
short
laugh;
"so
you've
lost
both
your
wife
and
your
place?"
"Precisely
so."
I
saw
him
give
a
quick,
covert
glance
all
round
my
room;
he
marked
its
narrow
limits,
its
scanty
furniture:
in
an
instant
he
had
comprehended
the
state
of
matters
had
absolved
me
from
the
crime
of
prosperity.
A
curious
effect
this
discovery
wrought
in
his
strange
mind;
I
am
morally
certain
that
if
he
had
found
me
installed
in
a
handsome
parlour,
lounging
on
a
soft
couch,
with
a
pretty,
wealthy
wife
at
my
side,
he
would
have
hated
me;
a
brief,
cold,
haughty
visit,
would
in
such
a
case
have
been
the
extreme
limit
of
his
civilities,
and
never
would
he
have
come
near
me
more,
so
long
as
the
tide
of
fortune
bore
me
smoothly
on
its
surface;
but
the
painted
furniture,
the
bare
walls,
the
cheerless
solitude
of
my
room
relaxed
his
rigid
pride,
and
I
know
not
what
softening
change
had
taken
place
both
in
his
voice
and
look
ere
he
spoke
again.
"You
have
got
another
place?"
"No."
"You
are
in
the
way
of
getting
one?"
"No."
"That
is
bad;
have
you
applied
to
Brown?"
"No,
indeed."
"You
had
better;
he
often
has
it
in
his
power
to
give
useful
information
in
such
matters."
"He
served
me
once
very
well;
I
have
no
claim
on
him,
and
am
not
in
the
humour
to
bother
him
again."
"Oh,
if
you're
bashful,
and
dread
being
intrusive,
you
need
only
commission
me.
I
shall
see
him
to
night;
I
can
put
in
a
word."
"I
beg
you
will
not,
Mr.
Hunsden;
I
am
in
your
debt
already;
you
did
me
an
important
service
when
I
was
at
X
;
got
me
out
of
a
den
where
I
was
dying:
that
service
I
have
never
repaid,
and
at
present
I
decline
positively
adding
another
item
to
the
account."
"If
the
wind
sits
that
way,
I'm
satisfied.
I
thought
my
unexampled
generosity
in
turning
you
out
of
that
accursed
counting
house
would
be
duly
appreciated
some
day:
'Cast
your
bread
on
the
waters,
and
it
shall
be
found
after
many
days,'
say
the
Scriptures.
Yes,
that's
right,
lad
make
much
of
me
I'm
a
nonpareil:
there's
nothing
like
me
in
the
common
herd.
In
the
meantime,
to
put
all
humbug
aside
and
talk
sense
for
a
few
moments,
you
would
be
greatly
the
better
of
a
situation,
and
what
is
more,
you
are
a
fool
if
you
refuse
to
take
one
from
any
hand
that
offers
it."
"Very
well,
Mr.
Hunsden;
now
you
have
settled
that
point,
talk
of
something
else.
What
news
from
X
?"
"I
have
not
settled
that
point,
or
at
least
there
is
another
to
settle
before
we
get
to
X
.
Is
this
Miss
Zenobie"
(Zoraide,
interposed
I)
"well,
Zoraide
is
she
really
married
to
Pelet?"
"I
tell
you
yes
and
if
you
don't
believe
me,
go
and
ask
the
cure
of
St.
Jacques."
"And
your
heart
is
broken?"
"I
am
not
aware
that
it
is;
it
feels
all
right
beats
as
usual."
"Then
your
feelings
are
less
superfine
than
I
took
them
to
be;
you
must
be
a
coarse,
callous
character,
to
bear
such
a
thwack
without
staggering
under
it."
"Staggering
under
it?
What
the
deuce
is
there
to
stagger
under
in
the
circumstance
of
a
Belgian
schoolmistress
marrying
a
French
schoolmaster?
The
progeny
will
doubtless
be
a
strange
hybrid
race;
but
that's
their
look
out
not
mine."
"He
indulges
in
scurrilous
jests,
and
the
bride
was
his
affianced
one!"
"Who
said
so?"
"Brown."
"I'll
tell
you
what,
Hunsden
Brown
is
an
old
gossip."
"He
is;
but
in
the
meantime,
if
his
gossip
be
founded
on
less
than
fact
if
you
took
no
particular
interest
in
Miss
Zoraide
why,
O
youthful
pedagogue!
did
you
leave
your
place
in
consequence
of
her
becoming
Madame
Pelet?"
"Because
"
I
felt
my
face
grow
a
little
hot;
"because
in
short,
Mr.
Hunsden,
I
decline
answering
any
more
questions,"
and
I
plunged
my
hands
deep
in
my
breeches
pocket.
Hunsden
triumphed:
his
eyes
his
laugh
announced
victory.
"What
the
deuce
are
you
laughing
at,
Mr.
Hunsden?"
"At
your
exemplary
composure.
Well,
lad,
I'll
not
bore
you;
I
see
how
it
is:
Zoraide
has
jilted
you
married
some
one
richer,
as
any
sensible
woman
would
have
done
if
she
had
had
the
chance."
I
made
no
reply
I
let
him
think
so,
not
feeling
inclined
to
enter
into
an
explanation
of
the
real
state
of
things,
and
as
little
to
forge
a
false
account;
but
it
was
not
easy
to
blind
Hunsden;
my
very
silence,
instead
of
convincing
him
that
he
had
hit
the
truth,
seemed
to
render
him
doubtful
about
it;
he
went
on:
"I
suppose
the
affair
has
been
conducted
as
such
affairs
always
are
amongst
rational
people:
you
offered
her
your
youth
and
your
talents
such
as
they
are
in
exchange
for
her
position
and
money:
I
don't
suppose
you
took
appearance,
or
what
is
called
LOVE,
into
the
account
for
I
understand
she
is
older
than
you,
and
Brown
says,
rather
sensible
looking
than
beautiful.
She,
having
then
no
chance
of
making
a
better
bargain,
was
at
first
inclined
to
come
to
terms
with
you,
but
Pelet
the
head
of
a
flourishing
school
stepped
in
with
a
higher
bid;
she
accepted,
and
he
has
got
her:
a
correct
transaction
perfectly
so
business
like
and
legitimate.
And
now
we'll
talk
of
something
else."
"Do,"
said
I,
very
glad
to
dismiss
the
topic,
and
especially
glad
to
have
baffled
the
sagacity
of
my
cross
questioner
if,
indeed,
I
had
baffled
it;
for
though
his
words
now
led
away
from
the
dangerous
point,
his
eyes,
keen
and
watchful,
seemed
still
preoccupied
with
the
former
idea.
"You
want
to
hear
news
from
X
?
And
what
interest
can
you
have
in
X
?
You
left
no
friends
there,
for
you
made
none.
Nobody
ever
asks
after
you
neither
man
nor
woman;
and
if
I
mention
your
name
in
company,
the
men
look
as
if
I
had
spoken
of
Prester
John;
and
the
women
sneer
covertly.
Our
X
belles
must
have
disliked
you.
How
did
you
excite
their
displeasure?"
"I
don't
know.
I
seldom
spoke
to
them
they
were
nothing
to
me.
I
considered
them
only
as
something
to
be
glanced
at
from
a
distance;
their
dresses
and
faces
were
often
pleasing
enough
to
the
eye:
but
I
could
not
understand
their
conversation,
nor
even
read
their
countenances.
When
I
caught
snatches
of
what
they
said,
I
could
never
make
much
of
it;
and
the
play
of
their
lips
and
eyes
did
not
help
me
at
all."
"That
was
your
fault,
not
theirs.
There
are
sensible,
as
well
as
handsome
women
in
X
;
women
it
is
worth
any
man's
while
to
talk
to,
and
with
whom
I
can
talk
with
pleasure:
but
you
had
and
have
no
pleasant
address;
there
is
nothing
in
you
to
induce
a
woman
to
be
affable.
I
have
remarked
you
sitting
near
the
door
in
a
room
full
of
company,
bent
on
hearing,
not
on
speaking;
on
observing,
not
on
entertaining;
looking
frigidly
shy
at
the
commencement
of
a
party,
confusingly
vigilant
about
the
middle,
and
insultingly
weary
towards
the
end.
Is
that
the
way,
do
you
think,
ever
to
communicate
pleasure
or
excite
interest?
No;
and
if
you
are
generally
unpopular,
it
is
because
you
deserve
to
be
so."
"Content!"
I
ejaculated.
"No,
you
are
not
content;
you
see
beauty
always
turning
its
back
on
you;
you
are
mortified
and
then
you
sneer.
I
verily
believe
all
that
is
desirable
on
earth
wealth,
reputation,
love
will
for
ever
to
you
be
the
ripe
grapes
on
the
high
trellis:
you'll
look
up
at
them;
they
will
tantalize
in
you
the
lust
of
the
eye;
but
they
are
out
of
reach:
you
have
not
the
address
to
fetch
a
ladder,
and
you'll
go
away
calling
them
sour."
Cutting
as
these
words
might
have
been
under
some
circumstances,
they
drew
no
blood
now.
My
life
was
changed;
my
experience
had
been
varied
since
I
left
X
,
but
Hunsden
could
not
know
this;
he
had
seen
me
only
in
the
character
of
Mr.
Crimsworth's
clerk
a
dependant
amongst
wealthy
strangers,
meeting
disdain
with
a
hard
front,
conscious
of
an
unsocial
and
unattractive
exterior,
refusing
to
sue
for
notice
which
I
was
sure
would
be
withheld,
declining
to
evince
an
admiration
which
I
knew
would
be
scorned
as
worthless.
He
could
not
be
aware
that
since
then
youth
and
loveliness
had
been
to
me
everyday
objects;
that
I
had
studied
them
at
leisure
and
closely,
and
had
seen
the
plain
texture
of
truth
under
the
embroidery
of
appearance;
nor
could
he,
keen
sighted
as
he
was,
penetrate
into
my
heart,
search
my
brain,
and
read
my
peculiar
sympathies
and
antipathies;
he
had
not
known
me
long
enough,
or
well
enough,
to
perceive
how
low
my
feelings
would
ebb
under
some
influences,
powerful
over
most
minds;
how
high,
how
fast
they
would
flow
under
other
influences,
that
perhaps
acted
with
the
more
intense
force
on
me,
because
they
acted
on
me
alone.
Neither
could
he
suspect
for
an
instant
the
history
of
my
communications
with
Mdlle.
Reuter;
secret
to
him
and
to
all
others
was
the
tale
of
her
strange
infatuation;
her
blandishments,
her
wiles
had
been
seen
but
by
me,
and
to
me
only
were
they
known;
but
they
had
changed
me,
for
they
had
proved
that
I
COULD
impress.
A
sweeter
secret
nestled
deeper
in
my
heart;
one
full
of
tenderness
and
as
full
of
strength:
it
took
the
sting
out
of
Hunsden's
sarcasm;
it
kept
me
unbent
by
shame,
and
unstirred
by
wrath.
But
of
all
this
I
could
say
nothing
nothing
decisive
at
least;
uncertainty
sealed
my
lips,
and
during
the
interval
of
silence
by
which
alone
I
replied
to
Mr.
Hunsden,
I
made
up
my
mind
to
be
for
the
present
wholly
misjudged
by
him,
and
misjudged
I
was;
he
thought
he
had
been
rather
too
hard
upon
me,
and
that
I
was
crushed
by
the
weight
of
his
upbraidings;
so
to
re
assure
me
he
said,
doubtless
I
should
mend
some
day;
I
was
only
at
the
beginning
of
life
yet;
and
since
happily
I
was
not
quite
without
sense,
every
false
step
I
made
would
be
a
good
lesson.
Just
then
I
turned
my
face
a
little
to
the
light;
the
approach
of
twilight,
and
my
position
in
the
window
seat,
had,
for
the
last
ten
minutes,
prevented
him
from
studying
my
countenance;
as
I
moved,
however,
he
caught
an
expression
which
he
thus
interpreted:
"Confound
it!
How
doggedly
self
approving
the
lad
looks!
I
thought
he
was
fit
to
die
with
shame,
and
there
he
sits
grinning
smiles,
as
good
as
to
say,
'Let
the
world
wag
as
it
will,
I've
the
philosopher's
stone
in
my
waist
coat
pocket,
and
the
elixir
of
life
in
my
cupboard;
I'm
independent
of
both
Fate
and
Fortune.'"
"Hunsden
you
spoke
of
grapes;
I
was
thinking
of
a
fruit
I
like
better
than
your
X
hot
house
grapes
an
unique
fruit,
growing
wild,
which
I
have
marked
as
my
own,
and
hope
one
day
to
gather
and
taste.
It
is
of
no
use
your
offering
me
the
draught
of
bitterness,
or
threatening
me
with
death
by
thirst:
I
have
the
anticipation
of
sweetness
on
my
palate;
the
hope
of
freshness
on
my
lips;
I
can
reject
the
unsavoury,
and
endure
the
exhausting."
"For
how
long?"
"Till
the
next
opportunity
for
effort;
and
as
the
prize
of
success
will
be
a
treasure
after
my
own
heart,
I'll
bring
a
bull's
strength
to
the
struggle."
"Bad
luck
crushes
bulls
as
easily
as
bullaces;
and,
I
believe,
the
fury
dogs
you:
you
were
born
with
a
wooden
spoon
in
your
mouth,
depend
on
it."
"I
believe
you;
and
I
mean
to
make
my
wooden
spoon
do
the
work
of
some
people's
silver
ladles:
grasped
firmly,
and
handled
nimbly,
even
a
wooden
spoon
will
shovel
up
broth."
Hunsden
rose:
"I
see,"
said
he;
"I
suppose
you're
one
of
those
who
develop
best
unwatched,
and
act
best
unaided
work
your
own
way.
Now,
I'll
go."
And,
without
another
word,
he
was
going;
at
the
door
he
turned:
"Crimsworth
Hall
is
sold,"
said
he.
"Sold!"
was
my
echo.
"Yes;
you
know,
of
course,
that
your
brother
failed
three
months
ago?"
"What!
Edward
Crimsworth?"
"Precisely;
and
his
wife
went
home
to
her
father's;
when
affairs
went
awry,
his
temper
sympathized
with
them;
he
used
her
ill;
I
told
you
he
would
be
a
tyrant
to
her
some
day;
as
to
him
"
"Ay,
as
to
him
what
is
become
of
him?"
"Nothing
extraordinary
don't
be
alarmed;
he
put
himself
under
the
protection
of
the
court,
compounded
with
his
creditors
tenpence
in
the
pound;
in
six
weeks
set
up
again,
coaxed
back
his
wife,
and
is
flourishing
like
a
green
bay
tree."
"And
Crimsworth
Hall
was
the
furniture
sold
too?"
"Everything
from
the
grand
piano
down
to
the
rolling
pin."
"And
the
contents
of
the
oak
dining
room
were
they
sold?"
"Of
course;
why
should
the
sofas
and
chairs
of
that
room
be
held
more
sacred
than
those
of
any
other?"
"And
the
pictures?"
"What
pictures?
Crimsworth
had
no
special
collection
that
I
know
of
he
did
not
profess
to
be
an
amateur."
"There
were
two
portraits,
one
on
each
side
the
mantelpiece;
you
cannot
have
forgotten
them,
Mr.
Hunsden;
you
once
noticed
that
of
the
lady
"
"Oh,
I
know!
the
thin
faced
gentlewoman
with
a
shawl
put
on
like
drapery.
Why,
as
a
matter
of
course,
it
would
be
sold
among
the
other
things.
If
you
had
been
rich,
you
might
have
bought
it,
for
I
remember
you
said
it
represented
your
mother:
you
see
what
it
is
to
be
without
a
sou."
I
did.
"But
surely,"
I
thought
to
myself,
"I
shall
not
always
be
so
poverty
stricken;
I
may
one
day
buy
it
back
yet.
Who
purchased
it?
do
you
know?"
I
asked.
"How
is
it
likely?
I
never
inquired
who
purchased
anything;
there
spoke
the
unpractical
man
to
imagine
all
the
world
is
interested
in
what
interests
himself!
Now,
good
night
I'm
off
for
Germany
to
morrow
morning;
I
shall
be
back
here
in
six
weeks,
and
possibly
I
may
call
and
see
you
again;
I
wonder
whether
you'll
be
still
out
of
place!"
he
laughed,
as
mockingly,
as
heartlessly
as
Mephistopheles,
and
so
laughing,
vanished.
Some
people,
however
indifferent
they
may
become
after
a
considerable
space
of
absence,
always
contrive
to
leave
a
pleasant
impression
just
at
parting;
not
so
Hunsden,
a
conference
with
him
affected
one
like
a
draught
of
Peruvian
bark;
it
seemed
a
concentration
of
the
specially
harsh,
stringent,
bitter;
whether,
like
bark,
it
invigorated,
I
scarcely
knew.
A
ruffled
mind
makes
a
restless
pillow;
I
slept
little
on
the
night
after
this
interview;
towards
morning
I
began
to
doze,
but
hardly
had
my
slumber
become
sleep,
when
I
was
roused
from
it
by
hearing
a
noise
in
my
sitting
room,
to
which
my
bed
room
adjoined
a
step,
and
a
shoving
of
furniture;
the
movement
lasted
barely
two
minutes;
with
the
closing
of
the
door
it
ceased.
I
listened;
not
a
mouse
stirred;
perhaps
I
had
dreamt
it;
perhaps
a
locataire
had
made
a
mistake,
and
entered
my
apartment
instead
of
his
own.
It
was
yet
but
five
o'clock;
neither
I
nor
the
day
were
wide
awake;
I
turned,
and
was
soon
unconscious.
When
I
did
rise,
about
two
hours
later,
I
had
forgotten
the
circumstance;
the
first
thing
I
saw,
however,
on
quitting
my
chamber,
recalled
it;
just
pushed
in
at
the
door
of
my
sitting
room,
and
still
standing
on
end,
was
a
wooden
packing
case
a
rough
deal
affair,
wide
but
shallow;
a
porter
had
doubtless
shoved
it
forward,
but
seeing
no
occupant
of
the
room,
had
left
it
at
the
entrance.
"That
is
none
of
mine,"
thought
I,
approaching;
"it
must
be
meant
for
somebody
else."
I
stooped
to
examine
the
address:
"Wm.
Crimsworth,
Esq.,
No
,
St.,
Brussels."
I
was
puzzled,
but
concluding
that
the
best
way
to
obtain
information
was
to
ask
within,
I
cut
the
cords
and
opened
the
case.
Green
baize
enveloped
its
contents,
sewn
carefully
at
the
sides;
I
ripped
the
pack
thread
with
my
pen
knife,
and
still,
as
the
seam
gave
way,
glimpses
of
gilding
appeared
through
the
widening
interstices.
Boards
and
baize
being
at
length
removed,
I
lifted
from
the
case
a
large
picture,
in
a
magnificent
frame;
leaning
it
against
a
chair,
in
a
position
where
the
light
from
the
window
fell
favourably
upon
it,
I
stepped
back
already
I
had
mounted
my
spectacles.
A
portrait
painter's
sky
(the
most
sombre
and
threatening
of
welkins),
and
distant
trees
of
a
conventional
depth
of
hue,
raised
in
full
relief
a
pale,
pensive
looking
female
face,
shadowed
with
soft
dark
hair,
almost
blending
with
the
equally
dark
clouds;
large,
solemn
eyes
looked
reflectively
into
mine;
a
thin
cheek
rested
on
a
delicate
little
hand;
a
shawl,
artistically
draped,
half
hid,
half
showed
a
slight
figure.
A
listener
(had
there
been
one)
might
have
heard
me,
after
ten
minutes'
silent
gazing,
utter
the
word
"Mother!"
I
might
have
said
more
but
with
me,
the
first
word
uttered
aloud
in
soliloquy
rouses
consciousness;
it
reminds
me
that
only
crazy
people
talk
to
themselves,
and
then
I
think
out
my
monologue,
instead
of
speaking
it.
I
had
thought
a
long
while,
and
a
long
while
had
contemplated
the
intelligence,
the
sweetness,
and
alas!
the
sadness
also
of
those
fine,
grey
eyes,
the
mental
power
of
that
forehead,
and
the
rare
sensibility
of
that
serious
mouth,
when
my
glance,
travelling
downwards,
fell
on
a
narrow
billet,
stuck
in
the
corner
of
the
picture,
between
the
frame
and
the
canvas.
Then
I
first
asked,
"Who
sent
this
picture?
Who
thought
of
me,
saved
it
out
of
the
wreck
of
Crimsworth
Hall,
and
now
commits
it
to
the
care
of
its
natural
keeper?"
I
took
the
note
from
its
niche;
thus
it
spoke:
"There
is
a
sort
of
stupid
pleasure
in
giving
a
child
sweets,
a
fool
his
bells,
a
dog
a
bone.
You
are
repaid
by
seeing
the
child
besmear
his
face
with
sugar;
by
witnessing
how
the
fool's
ecstasy
makes
a
greater
fool
of
him
than
ever;
by
watching
the
dog's
nature
come
out
over
his
bone.
In
giving
William
Crimsworth
his
mother's
picture,
I
give
him
sweets,
bells,
and
bone
all
in
one;
what
grieves
me
is,
that
I
cannot
behold
the
result;
I
would
have
added
five
shillings
more
to
my
bid
if
the
auctioneer
could
only
have
promised
me
that
pleasure.
"H.
Y.
H.
"P.S.
You
said
last
night
you
positively
declined
adding
another
item
to
your
account
with
me;
don't
you
think
I've
saved
you
that
trouble?"
I
muffled
the
picture
in
its
green
baize
covering,
restored
it
to
the
case,
and
having
transported
the
whole
concern
to
my
bed
room,
put
it
out
of
sight
under
my
bed.
My
pleasure
was
now
poisoned
by
pungent
pain;
I
determined
to
look
no
more
till
I
could
look
at
my
ease.
If
Hunsden
had
come
in
at
that
moment,
I
should
have
said
to
him,
"I
owe
you
nothing,
Hunsden
not
a
fraction
of
a
farthing:
you
have
paid
yourself
in
taunts!"
Too
anxious
to
remain
any
longer
quiescent,
I
had
no
sooner
breakfasted,
than
I
repaired
once
more
to
M.
Vandenhuten's,
scarcely
hoping
to
find
him
at
home;
for
a
week
had
barely
elapsed
since
my
first
call:
but
fancying
I
might
be
able
to
glean
information
as
to
the
time
when
his
return
was
expected.
A
better
result
awaited
me
than
I
had
anticipated,
for
though
the
family
were
yet
at
Ostend,
M.
Vandenhuten
had
come
over
to
Brussels
on
business
for
the
day.
He
received
me
with
the
quiet
kindness
of
a
sincere
though
not
excitable
man.
I
had
not
sat
five
minutes
alone
with
him
in
his
bureau,
before
I
became
aware
of
a
sense
of
ease
in
his
presence,
such
as
I
rarely
experienced
with
strangers.
I
was
surprised
at
my
own
composure,
for,
after
all,
I
had
come
on
business
to
me
exceedingly
painful
that
of
soliciting
a
favour.
I
asked
on
what
basis
the
calm
rested
I
feared
it
might
be
deceptive.
Ere
long
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
ground,
and
at
once
I
felt
assured
of
its
solidity;
I
knew
where
it
was.
M.
Vandenhuten
was
rich,
respected,
and
influential;
I,
poor,
despised
and
powerless;
so
we
stood
to
the
world
at
large
as
members
of
the
world's
society;
but
to
each
other,
as
a
pair
of
human
beings,
our
positions
were
reversed.
The
Dutchman
(he
was
not
Flamand,
but
pure
Hollandais)
was
slow,
cool,
of
rather
dense
intelligence,
though
sound
and
accurate
judgment;
the
Englishman
far
more
nervous,
active,
quicker
both
to
plan
and
to
practise,
to
conceive
and
to
realize.
The
Dutchman
was
benevolent,
the
Englishman
susceptible;
in
short
our
characters
dovetailed,
but
my
mind
having
more
fire
and
action
than
his,
instinctively
assumed
and
kept
the
predominance.
This
point
settled,
and
my
position
well
ascertained,
I
addressed
him
on
the
subject
of
my
affairs
with
that
genuine
frankness
which
full
confidence
can
alone
inspire.
It
was
a
pleasure
to
him
to
be
so
appealed
to;
he
thanked
me
for
giving
him
this
opportunity
of
using
a
little
exertion
in
my
behalf.
I
went
on
to
explain
to
him
that
my
wish
was
not
so
much
to
be
helped,
as
to
be
put
into
the
way
of
helping
myself;
of
him
I
did
not
want
exertion
that
was
to
be
my
part
but
only
information
and
recommendation.
Soon
after
I
rose
to
go.
He
held
out
his
hand
at
parting
an
action
of
greater
significance
with
foreigners
than
with
Englishmen.
As
I
exchanged
a
smile
with
him,
I
thought
the
benevolence
of
his
truthful
face
was
better
than
the
intelligence
of
my
own.
Characters
of
my
order
experience
a
balm
like
solace
in
the
contact
of
such
souls
as
animated
the
honest
breast
of
Victor
Vandenhuten.
The
next
fortnight
was
a
period
of
many
alternations;
my
existence
during
its
lapse
resembled
a
sky
of
one
of
those
autumnal
nights
which
are
specially
haunted
by
meteors
and
falling
stars.
Hopes
and
fears,
expectations
and
disappointments,
descended
in
glancing
showers
from
zenith
to
horizon;
but
all
were
transient,
and
darkness
followed
swift
each
vanishing
apparition.
M.
Vandenhuten
aided
me
faithfully;
he
set
me
on
the
track
of
several
places,
and
himself
made
efforts
to
secure
them
for
me;
but
for
a
long
time
solicitation
and
recommendation
were
vain
the
door
either
shut
in
my
face
when
I
was
about
to
walk
in,
or
another
candidate,
entering
before
me,
rendered
my
further
advance
useless.
Feverish
and
roused,
no
disappointment
arrested
me;
defeat
following
fast
on
defeat
served
as
stimulants
to
will.
I
forgot
fastidiousness,
conquered
reserve,
thrust
pride
from
me:
I
asked,
I
persevered,
I
remonstrated,
I
dunned.
It
is
so
that
openings
are
forced
into
the
guarded
circle
where
Fortune
sits
dealing
favours
round.
My
perseverance
made
me
known;
my
importunity
made
me
remarked.
I
was
inquired
about;
my
former
pupils'
parents,
gathering
the
reports
of
their
children,
heard
me
spoken
of
as
talented,
and
they
echoed
the
word:
the
sound,
bandied
about
at
random,
came
at
last
to
ears
which,
but
for
its
universality,
it
might
never
have
reached;
and
at
the
very
crisis
when
I
had
tried
my
last
effort
and
knew
not
what
to
do,
Fortune
looked
in
at
me
one
morning,
as
I
sat
in
drear
and
almost
desperate
deliberation
on
my
bedstead,
nodded
with
the
familiarity
of
an
old
acquaintance
though
God
knows
I
had
never
met
her
before
and
threw
a
prize
into
my
lap.
In
the
second
week
of
October,
18
,
I
got
the
appointment
of
English
professor
to
all
the
classes
of
College,
Brussels,
with
a
salary
of
three
thousand
francs
per
annum;
and
the
certainty
of
being
able,
by
dint
of
the
reputation
and
publicity
accompanying
the
position,
to
make
as
much
more
by
private
means.
The
official
notice,
which
communicated
this
information,
mentioned
also
that
it
was
the
strong
recommendation
of
M.
Vandenhuten,
negociant,
which
had
turned
the
scale
of
choice
in
my
favour.
No
sooner
had
I
read
the
announcement
than
I
hurried
to
M.
Vandenhuten's
bureau,
pushed
the
document
under
his
nose,
and
when
he
had
perused
it,
took
both
his
hands,
and
thanked
him
with
unrestrained
vivacity.
My
vivid
words
and
emphatic
gesture
moved
his
Dutch
calm
to
unwonted
sensation.
He
said
he
was
happy
glad
to
have
served
me;
but
he
had
done
nothing
meriting
such
thanks.
He
had
not
laid
out
a
centime
only
scratched
a
few
words
on
a
sheet
of
paper.
Again
I
repeated
to
him
"You
have
made
me
quite
happy,
and
in
a
way
that
suits
me;
I
do
not
feel
an
obligation
irksome,
conferred
by
your
kind
hand;
I
do
not
feel
disposed
to
shun
you
because
you
have
done
me
a
favour;
from
this
day
you
must
consent
to
admit
me
to
your
intimate
acquaintance,
for
I
shall
hereafter
recur
again
and
again
to
the
pleasure
of
your
society."
"Ainsi
soit
il,"
was
the
reply,
accompanied
by
a
smile
of
benignant
content.
I
went
away
with
its
sunshine
in
my
heart.
IT
was
two
o'clock
when
I
returned
to
my
lodgings;
my
dinner,
just
brought
in
from
a
neighbouring
hotel,
smoked
on
the
table;
I
sat
down
thinking
to
eat
had
the
plate
been
heaped
with
potsherds
and
broken
glass,
instead
of
boiled
beef
and
haricots,
I
could
not
have
made
a
more
signal
failure:
appetite
had
forsaken
me.
Impatient
of
seeing
food
which
I
could
not
taste,
I
put
it
all
aside
into
a
cupboard,
and
then
demanded,
"What
shall
I
do
till
evening?"
for
before
six
P.M.
it
would
be
vain
to
seek
the
Rue
Notre
Dame
aux
Neiges;
its
inhabitant
(for
me
it
had
but
one)
was
detained
by
her
vocation
elsewhere.
I
walked
in
the
streets
of
Brussels,
and
I
walked
in
my
own
room
from
two
o'clock
till
six;
never
once
in
that
space
of
time
did
I
sit
down.
I
was
in
my
chamber
when
the
last
named
hour
struck;
I
had
just
bathed
my
face
and
feverish
hands,
and
was
standing
near
the
glass;
my
cheek
was
crimson,
my
eye
was
flame,
still
all
my
features
looked
quite
settled
and
calm.
Descending
swiftly
the
stair
and
stepping
out,
I
was
glad
to
see
Twilight
drawing
on
in
clouds;
such
shade
was
to
me
like
a
grateful
screen,
and
the
chill
of
latter
Autumn,
breathing
in
a
fitful
wind
from
the
north
west,
met
me
as
a
refreshing
coolness.
Still
I
saw
it
was
cold
to
others,
for
the
women
I
passed
were
wrapped
in
shawls,
and
the
men
had
their
coats
buttoned
close.
When
are
we
quite
happy?
Was
I
so
then?
No;
an
urgent
and
growing
dread
worried
my
nerves,
and
had
worried
them
since
the
first
moment
good
tidings
had
reached
me.
How
was
Frances?
It
was
ten
weeks
since
I
had
seen
her,
six
since
I
had
heard
from
her,
or
of
her.
I
had
answered
her
letter
by
a
brief
note,
friendly
but
calm,
in
which
no
mention
of
continued
correspondence
or
further
visits
was
made.
At
that
hour
my
bark
hung
on
the
topmost
curl
of
a
wave
of
fate,
and
I
knew
not
on
what
shoal
the
onward
rush
of
the
billow
might
hurl
it;
I
would
not
then
attach
her
destiny
to
mine
by
the
slightest
thread;
if
doomed
to
split
on
the
rock,
or
run
aground
on
the
sand
bank,
I
was
resolved
no
other
vessel
should
share
my
disaster:
but
six
weeks
was
a
long
time;
and
could
it
be
that
she
was
still
well
and
doing
well?
Were
not
all
sages
agreed
in
declaring
that
happiness
finds
no
climax
on
earth?
Dared
I
think
that
but
half
a
street
now
divided
me
from
the
full
cup
of
contentment
the
draught
drawn
from
waters
said
to
flow
only
in
heaven?
I
was
at
the
door;
I
entered
the
quiet
house;
I
mounted
the
stairs;
the
lobby
was
void
and
still,
all
the
doors
closed;
I
looked
for
the
neat
green
mat;
it
lay
duly
in
its
place.
"Signal
of
hope!"
I
said,
and
advanced.
"But
I
will
be
a
little
calmer;
I
am
not
going
to
rush
in,
and
get
up
a
scene
directly."
Forcibly
staying
my
eager
step,
I
paused
on
the
mat.
"What
an
absolute
hush!
Is
she
in?
Is
anybody
in?"
I
demanded
to
myself.
A
little
tinkle,
as
of
cinders
falling
from
a
grate,
replied;
a
movement
a
fire
was
gently
stirred;
and
the
slight
rustle
of
life
continuing,
a
step
paced
equably
backwards
and
forwards,
backwards
and
forwards,
in
the
apartment.
Fascinated,
I
stood,
more
fixedly
fascinated
when
a
voice
rewarded
the
attention
of
my
strained
ear
so
low,
so
self
addressed,
I
never
fancied
the
speaker
otherwise
than
alone;
solitude
might
speak
thus
in
a
desert,
or
in
the
hall
of
a
forsaken
house.
"'And
ne'er
but
once,
my
son,'
he
said,
'Was
yon
dark
cavern
trod;
In
persecution's
iron
days,
When
the
land
was
left
by
God.
From
Bewley's
bog,
with
slaughter
red,
A
wanderer
hither
drew;
And
oft
he
stopp'd
and
turn'd
his
head,
As
by
fits
the
night
winds
blew.
For
trampling
round
by
Cheviot
edge
Were
heard
the
troopers
keen;
And
frequent
from
the
Whitelaw
ridge
The
death
shot
flash'd
between.'"
etc.
etc.
The
old
Scotch
ballad
was
partly
recited,
then
dropt;
a
pause
ensued;
then
another
strain
followed,
in
French,
of
which
the
purport,
translated,
ran
as
follows:
I
gave,
at
first,
attention
close;
Then
interest
warm
ensued;
From
interest,
as
improvement
rose,
Succeeded
gratitude.
Obedience
was
no
effort
soon,
And
labour
was
no
pain;
If
tired,
a
word,
a
glance
alone
Would
give
me
strength
again.
From
others
of
the
studious
band,
Ere
long
he
singled
me;
But
only
by
more
close
demand,
And
sterner
urgency.
The
task
he
from
another
took,
From
me
he
did
reject;
He
would
no
slight
omission
brook,
And
suffer
no
defect.
If
my
companions
went
astray,
He
scarce
their
wanderings
blam'd;
If
I
but
falter'd
in
the
way,
His
anger
fiercely
flam'd.
Something
stirred
in
an
adjoining
chamber;
it
would
not
do
to
be
surprised
eaves
dropping;
I
tapped
hastily,
and
as
hastily
entered.
Frances
was
just
before
me;
she
had
been
walking
slowly
in
her
room,
and
her
step
was
checked
by
my
advent:
Twilight
only
was
with
her,
and
tranquil,
ruddy
Firelight;
to
these
sisters,
the
Bright
and
the
Dark,
she
had
been
speaking,
ere
I
entered,
in
poetry.
Sir
Walter
Scott's
voice,
to
her
a
foreign,
far
off
sound,
a
mountain
echo,
had
uttered
itself
in
the
first
stanzas;
the
second,
I
thought,
from
the
style
and
the
substance,
was
the
language
of
her
own
heart.
Her
face
was
grave,
its
expression
concentrated;
she
bent
on
me
an
unsmiling
eye
an
eye
just
returning
from
abstraction,
just
awaking
from
dreams:
well
arranged
was
her
simple
attire,
smooth
her
dark
hair,
orderly
her
tranquil
room;
but
what
with
her
thoughtful
look,
her
serious
self
reliance,
her
bent
to
meditation
and
haply
inspiration
what
had
she
to
do
with
love?
"Nothing,"
was
the
answer
of
her
own
sad,
though
gentle
countenance;
it
seemed
to
say,
"I
must
cultivate
fortitude
and
cling
to
poetry;
one
is
to
be
my
support
and
the
other
my
solace
through
life.
Human
affections
do
not
bloom,
nor
do
human
passions
glow
for
me."
Other
women
have
such
thoughts.
Frances,
had
she
been
as
desolate
as
she
deemed,
would
not
have
been
worse
off
than
thousands
of
her
sex.
Look
at
the
rigid
and
formal
race
of
old
maids
the
race
whom
all
despise;
they
have
fed
themselves,
from
youth
upwards,
on
maxims
of
resignation
and
endurance.
Many
of
them
get
ossified
with
the
dry
diet;
self
control
is
so
continually
their
thought,
so
perpetually
their
object,
that
at
last
it
absorbs
the
softer
and
more
agreeable
qualities
of
their
nature;
and
they
die
mere
models
of
austerity,
fashioned
out
of
a
little
parchment
and
much
bone.
Anatomists
will
tell
you
that
there
is
a
heart
in
the
withered
old
maid's
carcass
the
same
as
in
that
of
any
cherished
wife
or
proud
mother
in
the
land.
Can
this
be
so?
I
really
don't
know;
but
feel
inclined
to
doubt
it.
I
came
forward,
bade
Frances
"good
evening,"
and
took
my
seat.
The
chair
I
had
chosen
was
one
she
had
probably
just
left;
it
stood
by
a
little
table
where
were
her
open
desk
and
papers.
I
know
not
whether
she
had
fully
recognized
me
at
first,
but
she
did
so
now;
and
in
a
voice,
soft
but
quiet,
she
returned
my
greeting.
I
had
shown
no
eagerness;
she
took
her
cue
from
me,
and
evinced
no
surprise.
We
met
as
we
had
always
met,
as
master
and
pupil
nothing
more.
I
proceeded
to
handle
the
papers;
Frances,
observant
and
serviceable,
stepped
into
an
inner
room,
brought
a
candle,
lit
it,
placed
it
by
me;
then
drew
the
curtain
over
the
lattice,
and
having
added
a
little
fresh
fuel
to
the
already
bright
fire,
she
drew
a
second
chair
to
the
table
and
sat
down
at
my
right
hand,
a
little
removed.
The
paper
on
the
top
was
a
translation
of
some
grave
French
author
into
English,
but
underneath
lay
a
sheet
with
stanzas;
on
this
I
laid
hands.
Frances
half
rose,
made
a
movement
to
recover
the
captured
spoil,
saying,
that
was
nothing
a
mere
copy
of
verses.
I
put
by
resistance
with
the
decision
I
knew
she
never
long
opposed;
but
on
this
occasion
her
fingers
had
fastened
on
the
paper.
I
had
quietly
to
unloose
them;
their
hold
dissolved
to
my
touch;
her
hand
shrunk
away;
my
own
would
fain
have
followed
it,
but
for
the
present
I
forbade
such
impulse.
The
first
page
of
the
sheet
was
occupied
with
the
lines
I
had
overheard;
the
sequel
was
not
exactly
the
writer's
own
experience,
but
a
composition
by
portions
of
that
experience
suggested.
Thus
while
egotism
was
avoided,
the
fancy
was
exercised,
and
the
heart
satisfied.
I
translate
as
before,
and
my
translation
is
nearly
literal;
it
continued
thus:
When
sickness
stay'd
awhile
my
course,
He
seem'd
impatient
still,
Because
his
pupil's
flagging
force
Could
not
obey
his
will.
One
day
when
summoned
to
the
bed
Where
pain
and
I
did
strive,
I
heard
him,
as
he
bent
his
head,
Say,
"God,
she
must
revive!"
I
felt
his
hand,
with
gentle
stress,
A
moment
laid
on
mine,
And
wished
to
mark
my
consciousness
By
some
responsive
sign.
But
pow'rless
then
to
speak
or
move,
I
only
felt,
within,
The
sense
of
Hope,
the
strength
of
Love,
Their
healing
work
begin.
And
as
he
from
the
room
withdrew,
My
heart
his
steps
pursued;
I
long'd
to
prove,
by
efforts
new;
My
speechless
gratitude.
When
once
again
I
took
my
place,
Long
vacant,
in
the
class,
Th'
unfrequent
smile
across
his
face
Did
for
one
moment
pass.
The
lessons
done;
the
signal
made
Of
glad
release
and
play,
He,
as
he
passed,
an
instant
stay'd,
One
kindly
word
to
say.
"Jane,
till
to
morrow
you
are
free
From
tedious
task
and
rule;
This
afternoon
I
must
not
see
That
yet
pale
face
in
school.
"Seek
in
the
garden
shades
a
seat,
Far
from
the
play
ground
din;
The
sun
is
warm,
the
air
is
sweet:
Stay
till
I
call
you
in."
A
long
and
pleasant
afternoon
I
passed
in
those
green
bowers;
All
silent,
tranquil,
and
alone
With
birds,
and
bees,
and
flowers.
Yet,
when
my
master's
voice
I
heard
Call,
from
the
window,
"Jane!"
I
entered,
joyful,
at
the
word,
The
busy
house
again.
He,
in
the
hall,
paced
up
and
down;
He
paused
as
I
passed
by;
His
forehead
stern
relaxed
its
frown:
He
raised
his
deep
set
eye.
"Not
quite
so
pale,"
he
murmured
low.
"Now
Jane,
go
rest
awhile."
And
as
I
smiled,
his
smoothened
brow
Returned
as
glad
a
smile.
My
perfect
health
restored,
he
took
His
mien
austere
again;
And,
as
before,
he
would
not
brook
The
slightest
fault
from
Jane.
The
longest
task,
the
hardest
theme
Fell
to
my
share
as
erst,
And
still
I
toiled
to
place
my
name
In
every
study
first.
He
yet
begrudged
and
stinted
praise,
But
I
had
learnt
to
read
The
secret
meaning
of
his
face,
And
that
was
my
best
meed.
Even
when
his
hasty
temper
spoke
In
tones
that
sorrow
stirred,
My
grief
was
lulled
as
soon
as
woke
By
some
relenting
word.
And
when
he
lent
some
precious
book,
Or
gave
some
fragrant
flower,
I
did
not
quail
to
Envy's
look,
Upheld
by
Pleasure's
power.
At
last
our
school
ranks
took
their
ground,
The
hard
fought
field
I
won;
The
prize,
a
laurel
wreath,
was
bound
My
throbbing
forehead
on.
Low
at
my
master's
knee
I
bent,
The
offered
crown
to
meet;
Its
green
leaves
through
my
temples
sent
A
thrill
as
wild
as
sweet.
The
strong
pulse
of
Ambition
struck
In
every
vein
I
owned;
At
the
same
instant,
bleeding
broke
A
secret,
inward
wound.
The
hour
of
triumph
was
to
me
The
hour
of
sorrow
sore;
A
day
hence
I
must
cross
the
sea,
Ne'er
to
recross
it
more.
An
hour
hence,
in
my
master's
room
I
with
him
sat
alone,
And
told
him
what
a
dreary
gloom
O'er
joy
had
parting
thrown.
He
little
said;
the
time
was
brief,
The
ship
was
soon
to
sail,
And
while
I
sobbed
in
bitter
grief,
My
master
but
looked
pale.
They
called
in
haste;
he
bade
me
go,
Then
snatched
me
back
again;
He
held
me
fast
and
murmured
low,
"Why
will
they
part
us,
Jane?"
"Were
you
not
happy
in
my
care?
Did
I
not
faithful
prove?
Will
others
to
my
darling
bear
As
true,
as
deep
a
love?
"O
God,
watch
o'er
my
foster
child!
O
guard
her
gentle
head!
When
minds
are
high
and
tempests
wild
Protection
round
her
spread!
"They
call
again;
leave
then
my
breast;
Quit
thy
true
shelter,
Jane;
But
when
deceived,
repulsed,
opprest,
Come
home
to
me
again!"
I
read
then
dreamily
made
marks
on
the
margin
with
my
pencil;
thinking
all
the
while
of
other
things;
thinking
that
"Jane"
was
now
at
my
side;
no
child,
but
a
girl
of
nineteen;
and
she
might
be
mine,
so
my
heart
affirmed;
Poverty's
curse
was
taken
off
me;
Envy
and
Jealousy
were
far
away,
and
unapprized
of
this
our
quiet
meeting;
the
frost
of
the
Master's
manner
might
melt;
I
felt
the
thaw
coming
fast,
whether
I
would
or
not;
no
further
need
for
the
eye
to
practise
a
hard
look,
for
the
brow
to
compress
its
expanse
into
a
stern
fold:
it
was
now
permitted
to
suffer
the
outward
revelation
of
the
inward
glow
to
seek,
demand,
elicit
an
answering
ardour.
While
musing
thus,
I
thought
that
the
grass
on
Hermon
never
drank
the
fresh
dews
of
sunset
more
gratefully
than
my
feelings
drank
the
bliss
of
this
hour.
Frances
rose,
as
if
restless;
she
passed
before
me
to
stir
the
fire,
which
did
not
want
stirring;
she
lifted
and
put
down
the
little
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece;
her
dress
waved
within
a
yard
of
me;
slight,
straight,
and
elegant,
she
stood
erect
on
the
hearth.
There
are
impulses
we
can
control;
but
there
are
others
which
control
us,
because
they
attain
us
with
a
tiger
leap,
and
are
our
masters
ere
we
have
seen
them.
Perhaps,
though,
such
impulses
are
seldom
altogether
bad;
perhaps
Reason,
by
a
process
as
brief
as
quiet,
a
process
that
is
finished
ere
felt,
has
ascertained
the
sanity
of
the
deed
Instinct
meditates,
and
feels
justified
in
remaining
passive
while
it
is
performed.
I
know
I
did
not
reason,
I
did
not
plan
or
intend,
yet,
whereas
one
moment
I
was
sitting
solus
on
the
chair
near
the
table,
the
next,
I
held
Frances
on
my
knee,
placed
there
with
sharpness
and
decision,
and
retained
with
exceeding
tenacity.
"Monsieur!"
cried
Frances,
and
was
still:
not
another
word
escaped
her
lips;
sorely
confounded
she
seemed
during
the
lapse
of
the
first
few
moments;
but
the
amazement
soon
subsided;
terror
did
not
succeed,
nor
fury:
after
all,
she
was
only
a
little
nearer
than
she
had
ever
been
before,
to
one
she
habitually
respected
and
trusted;
embarrassment
might
have
impelled
her
to
contend,
but
self
respect
checked
resistance
where
resistance
was
useless.
"Frances,
how
much
regard
have
you
for
me?"
was
my
demand.
No
answer;
the
situation
was
yet
too
new
and
surprising
to
permit
speech.
On
this
consideration,
I
compelled
myself
for
some
seconds
to
tolerate
her
silence,
though
impatient
of
it:
presently,
I
repeated
the
same
question
probably,
not
in
the
calmest
of
tones;
she
looked
at
me;
my
face,
doubtless,
was
no
model
of
composure,
my
eyes
no
still
wells
of
tranquillity.
"Do
speak,"
I
urged;
and
a
very
low,
hurried,
yet
still
arch
voice
said
"Monsieur,
vous
me
faites
mal;
de
grace
lachez
un
peu
ma
main
droite."
In
truth
I
became
aware
that
I
was
holding
the
said
"main
droite"
in
a
somewhat
ruthless
grasp:
I
did
as
desired;
and,
for
the
third
time,
asked
more
gently
"Frances,
how
much
regard
have
you
for
me?"
"Mon
maitre,
j'en
ai
beaucoup,"
was
the
truthful
rejoinder.
"Frances,
have
you
enough
to
give
yourself
to
me
as
my
wife?
to
accept
me
as
your
husband?"
I
felt
the
agitation
of
the
heart,
I
saw
"the
purple
light
of
love"
cast
its
glowing
reflection
on
cheeks,
temples,
neck;
I
desired
to
consult
the
eye,
but
sheltering
lash
and
lid
forbade.
"Monsieur,"
said
the
soft
voice
at
last,
"Monsieur
desire
savoir
si
je
consens
si
enfin,
si
je
veux
me
marier
avec
lui?"
"Justement."
"Monsieur
sera
t
il
aussi
bon
mari
qu'il
a
ete
bon
maitre?"
"I
will
try,
Frances."
A
pause;
then
with
a
new,
yet
still
subdued
inflexion
of
the
voice
an
inflexion
which
provoked
while
it
pleased
me
accompanied,
too,
by
a
"sourire
a
la
fois
fin
et
timide"
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
tone:
"C'est
a
dire,
monsieur
sera
toujours
un
peu
entete
exigeant,
volontaire
?"
"Have
I
been
so,
Frances?"
"Mais
oui;
vous
le
savez
bien."
"Have
I
been
nothing
else?"
"Mais
oui;
vous
avez
ete
mon
meilleur
ami."
"And
what,
Frances,
are
you
to
me?"
"Votre
devouee
eleve,
qui
vous
aime
de
tout
son
coeur."
"Will
my
pupil
consent
to
pass
her
life
with
me?
Speak
English
now,
Frances."
Some
moments
were
taken
for
reflection;
the
answer,
pronounced
slowly,
ran
thus:
"You
have
always
made
me
happy;
I
like
to
hear
you
speak;
I
like
to
see
you;
I
like
to
be
near
you;
I
believe
you
are
very
good,
and
very
superior;
I
know
you
are
stern
to
those
who
are
careless
and
idle,
but
you
are
kind,
very
kind
to
the
attentive
and
industrious,
even
if
they
are
not
clever.
Master,
I
should
be
GLAD
to
live
with
you
always;"
and
she
made
a
sort
of
movement,
as
if
she
would
have
clung
to
me,
but
restraining
herself
she
only
added
with
earnest
emphasis
"Master,
I
consent
to
pass
my
life
with
you."
"Very
well,
Frances."
I
drew
her
a
little
nearer
to
my
heart;
I
took
a
first
kiss
from
her
lips,
thereby
sealing
the
compact,
now
framed
between
us;
afterwards
she
and
I
were
silent,
nor
was
our
silence
brief.
Frances'
thoughts,
during
this
interval,
I
know
not,
nor
did
I
attempt
to
guess
them;
I
was
not
occupied
in
searching
her
countenance,
nor
in
otherwise
troubling
her
composure.
The
peace
I
felt,
I
wished
her
to
feel;
my
arm,
it
is
true,
still
detained
her;
but
with
a
restraint
that
was
gentle
enough,
so
long
as
no
opposition
tightened
it.
My
gaze
was
on
the
red
fire;
my
heart
was
measuring
its
own
content;
it
sounded
and
sounded,
and
found
the
depth
fathomless.
"Monsieur,"
at
last
said
my
quiet
companion,
as
stirless
in
her
happiness
as
a
mouse
in
its
terror.
Even
now
in
speaking
she
scarcely
lifted
her
head.
"Well,
Frances?"
I
like
unexaggerated
intercourse;
it
is
not
my
way
to
overpower
with
amorous
epithets,
any
more
than
to
worry
with
selfishly
importunate
caresses.
"Monsieur
est
raisonnable,
n'est
ce
pas?"
"Yes;
especially
when
I
am
requested
to
be
so
in
English:
but
why
do
you
ask
me?
You
see
nothing
vehement
or
obtrusive
in
my
manner;
am
I
not
tranquil
enough?"
"Ce
n'est
pas
cela
"
began
Frances.
"English!"
I
reminded
her.
"Well,
monsieur,
I
wished
merely
to
say,
that
I
should
like,
of
course,
to
retain
my
employment
of
teaching.
You
will
teach
still,
I
suppose,
monsieur?"
"Oh,
yes!
It
is
all
I
have
to
depend
on."
"Bon!
I
mean
good.
Thus
we
shall
have
both
the
same
profession.
I
like
that;
and
my
efforts
to
get
on
will
be
as
unrestrained
as
yours
will
they
not,
monsieur?"
"You
are
laying
plans
to
be
independent
of
me,"
said
I.
"Yes,
monsieur;
I
must
be
no
incumbrance
to
you
no
burden
in
any
way."
"But,
Frances,
I
have
not
yet
told
you
what
my
prospects
are.
I
have
left
M.
Pelet's;
and
after
nearly
a
month's
seeking,
I
have
got
another
place,
with
a
salary
of
three
thousand
francs
a
year,
which
I
can
easily
double
by
a
little
additional
exertion.
Thus
you
see
it
would
be
useless
for
you
to
fag
yourself
by
going
out
to
give
lessons;
on
six
thousand
francs
you
and
I
can
live,
and
live
well."
Frances
seemed
to
consider.
There
is
something
flattering
to
man's
strength,
something
consonant
to
his
honourable
pride,
in
the
idea
of
becoming
the
providence
of
what
he
loves
feeding
and
clothing
it,
as
God
does
the
lilies
of
the
field.
So,
to
decide
her
resolution,
I
went
on:
"Life
has
been
painful
and
laborious
enough
to
you
so
far,
Frances;
you
require
complete
rest;
your
twelve
hundred
francs
would
not
form
a
very
important
addition
to
our
income,
and
what
sacrifice
of
comfort
to
earn
it!
Relinquish
your
labours:
you
must
be
weary,
and
let
me
have
the
happiness
of
giving
you
rest."
I
am
not
sure
whether
Frances
had
accorded
due
attention
to
my
harangue;
instead
of
answering
me
with
her
usual
respectful
promptitude,
she
only
sighed
and
said,
"How
rich
you
are,
monsieur!"
and
then
she
stirred
uneasy
in
my
arms.
"Three
thousand
francs!"
she
murmured,
"While
I
get
only
twelve
hundred!"
She
went
on
faster.
"However,
it
must
be
so
for
the
present;
and,
monsieur,
were
you
not
saying
something
about
my
giving
up
my
place?
Oh
no!
I
shall
hold
it
fast;"
and
her
little
fingers
emphatically
tightened
on
mine.
"Think
of
my
marrying
you
to
be
kept
by
you,
monsieur!
I
could
not
do
it;
and
how
dull
my
days
would
be!
You
would
be
away
teaching
in
close,
noisy
school
rooms,
from
morning
till
evening,
and
I
should
be
lingering
at
home,
unemployed
and
solitary;
I
should
get
depressed
and
sullen,
and
you
would
soon
tire
of
me."
"Frances,
you
could
read
and
study
two
things
you
like
so
well."
"Monsieur,
I
could
not;
I
like
a
contemplative
life,
but
I
like
an
active
life
better;
I
must
act
in
some
way,
and
act
with
you.
I
have
taken
notice,
monsieur,
that
people
who
are
only
in
each
other's
company
for
amusement,
never
really
like
each
other
so
well,
or
esteem
each
other
so
highly,
as
those
who
work
together,
and
perhaps
suffer
together."
"You
speak
God's
truth,"
said
I
at
last,
"and
you
shall
have
your
own
way,
for
it
is
the
best
way.
Now,
as
a
reward
for
such
ready
consent,
give
me
a
voluntary
kiss."
After
some
hesitation,
natural
to
a
novice
in
the
art
of
kissing,
she
brought
her
lips
into
very
shy
and
gentle
contact
with
my
forehead;
I
took
the
small
gift
as
a
loan,
and
repaid
it
promptly,
and
with
generous
interest.
I
know
not
whether
Frances
was
really
much
altered
since
the
time
I
first
saw
her;
but,
as
I
looked
at
her
now,
I
felt
that
she
was
singularly
changed
for
me;
the
sad
eye,
the
pale
cheek,
the
dejected
and
joyless
countenance
I
remembered
as
her
early
attributes,
were
quite
gone,
and
now
I
saw
a
face
dressed
in
graces;
smile,
dimple,
and
rosy
tint
rounded
its
contours
and
brightened
its
hues.
I
had
been
accustomed
to
nurse
a
flattering
idea
that
my
strong
attachment
to
her
proved
some
particular
perspicacity
in
my
nature;
she
was
not
handsome,
she
was
not
rich,
she
was
not
even
accomplished,
yet
was
she
my
life's
treasure;
I
must
then
be
a
man
of
peculiar
discernment.
To
night
my
eyes
opened
on
the
mistake
I
had
made;
I
began
to
suspect
that
it
was
only
my
tastes
which
were
unique,
not
my
power
of
discovering
and
appreciating
the
superiority
of
moral
worth
over
physical
charms.
For
me
Frances
had
physical
charms:
in
her
there
was
no
deformity
to
get
over;
none
of
those
prominent
defects
of
eyes,
teeth,
complexion,
shape,
which
hold
at
bay
the
admiration
of
the
boldest
male
champions
of
intellect
(for
women
can
love
a
downright
ugly
man
if
he
be
but
talented);
had
she
been
either
"edentee,
myope,
rugueuse,
ou
bossue,"
my
feelings
towards
her
might
still
have
been
kindly,
but
they
could
never
have
been
impassioned;
I
had
affection
for
the
poor
little
misshapen
Sylvie,
but
for
her
I
could
never
have
had
love.
It
is
true
Frances'
mental
points
had
been
the
first
to
interest
me,
and
they
still
retained
the
strongest
hold
on
my
preference;
but
I
liked
the
graces
of
her
person
too.
I
derived
a
pleasure,
purely
material,
from
contemplating
the
clearness
of
her
brown
eyes,
the
fairness
of
her
fine
skin,
the
purity
of
her
well
set
teeth,
the
proportion
of
her
delicate
form;
and
that
pleasure
I
could
ill
have
dispensed
with.
It
appeared,
then,
that
I
too
was
a
sensualist,
in
my
temperate
and
fastidious
way.
Now,
reader,
during
the
last
two
pages
I
have
been
giving
you
honey
fresh
from
flowers,
but
you
must
not
live
entirely
on
food
so
luscious;
taste
then
a
little
gall
just
a
drop,
by
way
of
change.
At
a
somewhat
late
hour
I
returned
to
my
lodgings:
having
temporarily
forgotten
that
man
had
any
such
coarse
cares
as
those
of
eating
and
drinking,
I
went
to
bed
fasting.
I
had
been
excited
and
in
action
all
day,
and
had
tasted
no
food
since
eight
that
morning;
besides,
for
a
fortnight
past,
I
had
known
no
rest
either
of
body
or
mind;
the
last
few
hours
had
been
a
sweet
delirium,
it
would
not
subside
now,
and
till
long
after
midnight,
broke
with
troubled
ecstacy
the
rest
I
so
much
needed.
At
last
I
dozed,
but
not
for
long;
it
was
yet
quite
dark
when
I
awoke,
and
my
waking
was
like
that
of
Job
when
a
spirit
passed
before
his
face,
and
like
him,
"the
hair
of
my
flesh
stood
up."
I
might
continue
the
parallel,
for
in
truth,
though
I
saw
nothing,
yet
"a
thing
was
secretly
brought
unto
me,
and
mine
ear
received
a
little
thereof;
there
was
silence,
and
I
heard
a
voice,"
saying
"In
the
midst
of
life
we
are
in
death."
That
sound,
and
the
sensation
of
chill
anguish
accompanying
it,
many
would
have
regarded
as
supernatural;
but
I
recognized
it
at
once
as
the
effect
of
reaction.
Man
is
ever
clogged
with
his
mortality,
and
it
was
my
mortal
nature
which
now
faltered
and
plained;
my
nerves,
which
jarred
and
gave
a
false
sound,
because
the
soul,
of
late
rushing
headlong
to
an
aim,
had
overstrained
the
body's
comparative
weakness.
A
horror
of
great
darkness
fell
upon
me;
I
felt
my
chamber
invaded
by
one
I
had
known
formerly,
but
had
thought
for
ever
departed.
I
was
temporarily
a
prey
to
hypochondria.
She
had
been
my
acquaintance,
nay,
my
guest,
once
before
in
boyhood;
I
had
entertained
her
at
bed
and
board
for
a
year;
for
that
space
of
time
I
had
her
to
myself
in
secret;
she
lay
with
me,
she
ate
with
me,
she
walked
out
with
me,
showing
me
nooks
in
woods,
hollows
in
hills,
where
we
could
sit
together,
and
where
she
could
drop
her
drear
veil
over
me,
and
so
hide
sky
and
sun,
grass
and
green
tree;
taking
me
entirely
to
her
death
cold
bosom,
and
holding
me
with
arms
of
bone.
What
tales
she
would
tell
me
at
such
hours!
What
songs
she
would
recite
in
my
ears!
How
she
would
discourse
to
me
of
her
own
country
the
grave
and
again
and
again
promise
to
conduct
me
there
ere
long;
and,
drawing
me
to
the
very
brink
of
a
black,
sullen
river,
show
me,
on
the
other
side,
shores
unequal
with
mound,
monument,
and
tablet,
standing
up
in
a
glimmer
more
hoary
than
moonlight.
"Necropolis!"
she
would
whisper,
pointing
to
the
pale
piles,
and
add,
"It
contains
a
mansion
prepared
for
you."
But
my
boyhood
was
lonely,
parentless;
uncheered
by
brother
or
sister;
and
there
was
no
marvel
that,
just
as
I
rose
to
youth,
a
sorceress,
finding
me
lost
in
vague
mental
wanderings,
with
many
affections
and
few
objects,
glowing
aspirations
and
gloomy
prospects,
strong
desires
and
slender
hopes,
should
lift
up
her
illusive
lamp
to
me
in
the
distance,
and
lure
me
to
her
vaulted
home
of
horrors.
No
wonder
her
spells
THEN
had
power;
but
NOW,
when
my
course
was
widening,
my
prospect
brightening;
when
my
affections
had
found
a
rest;
when
my
desires,
folding
wings,
weary
with
long
flight,
had
just
alighted
on
the
very
lap
of
fruition,
and
nestled
there
warm,
content,
under
the
caress
of
a
soft
hand
why
did
hypochondria
accost
me
now?
I
repulsed
her
as
one
would
a
dreaded
and
ghastly
concubine
coming
to
embitter
a
husband's
heart
toward
his
young
bride;
in
vain;
she
kept
her
sway
over
me
for
that
night
and
the
next
day,
and
eight
succeeding
days.
Afterwards,
my
spirits
began
slowly
to
recover
their
tone;
my
appetite
returned,
and
in
a
fortnight
I
was
well.
I
had
gone
about
as
usual
all
the
time,
and
had
said
nothing
to
anybody
of
what
I
felt;
but
I
was
glad
when
the
evil
spirit
departed
from
me,
and
I
could
again
seek
Frances,
and
sit
at
her
side,
freed
from
the
dreadful
tyranny
of
my
demon.
ONE
fine,
frosty
Sunday
in
November,
Frances
and
I
took
a
long
walk;
we
made
the
tour
of
the
city
by
the
Boulevards;
and,
afterwards,
Frances
being
a
little
tired,
we
sat
down
on
one
of
those
wayside
seats
placed
under
the
trees,
at
intervals,
for
the
accommodation
of
the
weary.
Frances
was
telling
me
about
Switzerland;
the
subject
animated
her;
and
I
was
just
thinking
that
her
eyes
spoke
full
as
eloquently
as
her
tongue,
when
she
stopped
and
remarked
"Monsieur,
there
is
a
gentleman
who
knows
you."
I
looked
up;
three
fashionably
dressed
men
were
just
then
passing
Englishmen,
I
knew
by
their
air
and
gait
as
well
as
by
their
features;
in
the
tallest
of
the
trio
I
at
once
recognized
Mr.
Hunsden;
he
was
in
the
act
of
lifting
his
hat
to
Frances;
afterwards,
he
made
a
grimace
at
me,
and
passed
on.
"Who
is
he?"
"A
person
I
knew
in
England."
"Why
did
he
bow
to
me?
He
does
not
know
me."
"Yes,
he
does
know
you,
in
his
way."
"How,
monsieur?"
(She
still
called
me
"monsieur";
I
could
not
persuade
her
to
adopt
any
more
familiar
term.)
"Did
you
not
read
the
expression
of
his
eyes?"
"Of
his
eyes?
No.
What
did
they
say?"
"To
you
they
said,
'How
do
you
do,
Wilhelmina
Crimsworth?'
To
me,
'So
you
have
found
your
counterpart
at
last;
there
she
sits,
the
female
of
your
kind!'"
"Monsieur,
you
could
not
read
all
that
in
his
eyes;
he
was
so
soon
gone."
"I
read
that
and
more,
Frances;
I
read
that
he
will
probably
call
on
me
this
evening,
or
on
some
future
occasion
shortly;
and
I
have
no
doubt
he
will
insist
on
being
introduced
to
you;
shall
I
bring
him
to
your
rooms?"
"If
you
please,
monsieur
I
have
no
objection;
I
think,
indeed,
I
should
rather
like
to
see
him
nearer;
he
looks
so
original."
As
I
had
anticipated,
Mr.
Hunsden
came
that
evening.
The
first
thing
he
said
was:
"You
need
not
begin
boasting,
Monsieur
le
Professeur;
I
know
about
your
appointment
to
College,
and
all
that;
Brown
has
told
me."
Then
he
intimated
that
he
had
returned
from
Germany
but
a
day
or
two
since;
afterwards,
he
abruptly
demanded
whether
that
was
Madame
Pelet
Reuter
with
whom
he
had
seen
me
on
the
Boulevards.
I
was
going
to
utter
a
rather
emphatic
negative,
but
on
second
thoughts
I
checked
myself,
and,
seeming
to
assent,
asked
what
he
thought
of
her?
"As
to
her,
I'll
come
to
that
directly;
but
first
I've
a
word
for
you.
I
see
you
are
a
scoundrel;
you've
no
business
to
be
promenading
about
with
another
man's
wife.
I
thought
you
had
sounder
sense
than
to
get
mixed
up
in
foreign
hodge
podge
of
this
sort."
"But
the
lady?"
"She's
too
good
for
you
evidently;
she
is
like
you,
but
something
better
than
you
no
beauty,
though;
yet
when
she
rose
(for
I
looked
back
to
see
you
both
walk
away)
I
thought
her
figure
and
carriage
good.
These
foreigners
understand
grace.
What
the
devil
has
she
done
with
Pelet?
She
has
not
been
married
to
him
three
months
he
must
be
a
spoon!"
I
would
not
let
the
mistake
go
too
far;
I
did
not
like
it
much.
"Pelet?
How
your
head
runs
on
Mons.
and
Madame
Pelet!
You
are
always
talking
about
them.
I
wish
to
the
gods
you
had
wed
Mdlle.
Zoraide
yourself!"
"Was
that
young
gentlewoman
not
Mdlle.
Zoraide?"
"No;
nor
Madame
Zoraide
either."
"Why
did
you
tell
a
lie,
then?"
"I
told
no
lie;
but
you
are
is
such
a
hurry.
She
is
a
pupil
of
mine
a
Swiss
girl."
"And
of
course
you
are
going
to
be
married
to
her?
Don't
deny
that."
"Married!
I
think
I
shall
if
Fate
spares
us
both
ten
weeks
longer.
That
is
my
little
wild
strawberry,
Hunsden,
whose
sweetness
made
me
careless
of
your
hothouse
grapes."
"Stop!
No
boasting
no
heroics;
I
won't
hear
them.
What
is
she?
To
what
caste
does
she
belong?"
I
smiled.
Hunsden
unconsciously
laid
stress
on
the
word
caste,
and,
in
fact,
republican,
lord
hater
as
he
was,
Hunsden
was
as
proud
of
his
old
shire
blood,
of
his
descent
and
family
standing,
respectable
and
respected
through
long
generations
back,
as
any
peer
in
the
realm
of
his
Norman
race
and
Conquest
dated
title.
Hunsden
would
as
little
have
thought
of
taking
a
wife
from
a
caste
inferior
to
his
own,
as
a
Stanley
would
think
of
mating
with
a
Cobden.
I
enjoyed
the
surprise
I
should
give;
I
enjoyed
the
triumph
of
my
practice
over
his
theory;
and
leaning
over
the
table,
and
uttering
the
words
slowly
but
with
repressed
glee,
I
said
concisely
"She
is
a
lace
mender."
Hunsden
examined
me.
He
did
not
SAY
he
was
surprised,
but
surprised
he
was;
he
had
his
own
notions
of
good
breeding.
I
saw
he
suspected
I
was
going
to
take
some
very
rash
step;
but
repressing
declamation
or
remonstrance,
he
only
answered
"Well,
you
are
the
best
judge
of
your
own
affairs.
A
lace
mender
may
make
a
good
wife
as
well
as
a
lady;
but
of
course
you
have
taken
care
to
ascertain
thoroughly
that
since
she
has
not
education,
fortune
or
station,
she
is
well
furnished
with
such
natural
qualities
as
you
think
most
likely
to
conduce
to
your
happiness.
Has
she
many
relations?"
"None
in
Brussels."
"That
is
better.
Relations
are
often
the
real
evil
in
such
cases.
I
cannot
but
think
that
a
train
of
inferior
connections
would
have
been
a
bore
to
you
to
your
life's
end."
After
sitting
in
silence
a
little
while
longer,
Hunsden
rose,
and
was
quietly
bidding
me
good
evening;
the
polite,
considerate
manner
in
which
he
offered
me
his
hand
(a
thing
he
had
never
done
before),
convinced
me
that
he
thought
I
had
made
a
terrible
fool
of
myself;
and
that,
ruined
and
thrown
away
as
I
was,
it
was
no
time
for
sarcasm
or
cynicism,
or
indeed
for
anything
but
indulgence
and
forbearance.
"Good
night,
William,"
he
said,
in
a
really
soft
voice,
while
his
face
looked
benevolently
compassionate.
"Good
night,
lad.
I
wish
you
and
your
future
wife
much
prosperity;
and
I
hope
she
will
satisfy
your
fastidious
soul."
I
had
much
ado
to
refrain
from
laughing
as
I
beheld
the
magnanimous
pity
of
his
mien;
maintaining,
however,
a
grave
air,
I
said:
"I
thought
you
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
Mdlle.
Henri?"
"Oh,
that
is
the
name!
Yes
if
it
would
be
convenient,
I
should
like
to
see
her
but
."
He
hesitated.
"Well?"
"I
should
on
no
account
wish
to
intrude."
"Come,
then,"
said
I.
We
set
out.
Hunsden
no
doubt
regarded
me
as
a
rash,
imprudent
man,
thus
to
show
my
poor
little
grisette
sweetheart,
in
her
poor
little
unfurnished
grenier;
but
he
prepared
to
act
the
real
gentleman,
having,
in
fact,
the
kernel
of
that
character,
under
the
harsh
husk
it
pleased
him
to
wear
by
way
of
mental
mackintosh.
He
talked
affably,
and
even
gently,
as
we
went
along
the
street;
he
had
never
been
so
civil
to
me
in
his
life.
We
reached
the
house,
entered,
ascended
the
stair;
on
gaining
the
lobby,
Hunsden
turned
to
mount
a
narrower
stair
which
led
to
a
higher
story;
I
saw
his
mind
was
bent
on
the
attics.
"Here,
Mr.
Hunsden,"
said
I
quietly,
tapping
at
Frances'
door.
He
turned;
in
his
genuine
politeness
he
was
a
little
disconcerted
at
having
made
the
mistake;
his
eye
reverted
to
the
green
mat,
but
he
said
nothing.
We
walked
in,
and
Frances
rose
from
her
seat
near
the
table
to
receive
us;
her
mourning
attire
gave
her
a
recluse,
rather
conventual,
but
withal
very
distinguished
look;
its
grave
simplicity
added
nothing
to
beauty,
but
much
to
dignity;
the
finish
of
the
white
collar
and
manchettes
sufficed
for
a
relief
to
the
merino
gown
of
solemn
black;
ornament
was
forsworn.
Frances
curtsied
with
sedate
grace,
looking,
as
she
always
did,
when
one
first
accosted
her,
more
a
woman
to
respect
than
to
love;
I
introduced
Mr.
Hunsden,
and
she
expressed
her
happiness
at
making
his
acquaintance
in
French.
The
pure
and
polished
accent,
the
low
yet
sweet
and
rather
full
voice,
produced
their
effect
immediately;
Hunsden
spoke
French
in
reply;
I
had
not
heard
him
speak
that
language
before;
he
managed
it
very
well.
I
retired
to
the
window
seat;
Mr.
Hunsden,
at
his
hostess's
invitation,
occupied
a
chair
near
the
hearth;
from
my
position
I
could
see
them
both,
and
the
room
too,
at
a
glance.
The
room
was
so
clean
and
bright,
it
looked
like
a
little
polished
cabinet;
a
glass
filled
with
flowers
in
the
centre
of
the
table,
a
fresh
rose
in
each
china
cup
on
the
mantelpiece
gave
it
an
air
of
FETE.
Frances
was
serious,
and
Mr.
Hunsden
subdued,
but
both
mutually
polite;
they
got
on
at
the
French
swimmingly:
ordinary
topics
were
discussed
with
great
state
and
decorum;
I
thought
I
had
never
seen
two
such
models
of
propriety,
for
Hunsden
(thanks
to
the
constraint
of
the
foreign
tongue)
was
obliged
to
shape
his
phrases,
and
measure
his
sentences,
with
a
care
that
forbade
any
eccentricity.
At
last
England
was
mentioned,
and
Frances
proceeded
to
ask
questions.
Animated
by
degrees,
she
began
to
change,
just
as
a
grave
night
sky
changes
at
the
approach
of
sunrise:
first
it
seemed
as
if
her
forehead
cleared,
then
her
eyes
glittered,
her
features
relaxed,
and
became
quite
mobile;
her
subdued
complexion
grew
warm
and
transparent;
to
me,
she
now
looked
pretty;
before,
she
had
only
looked
ladylike.
She
had
many
things
to
say
to
the
Englishman
just
fresh
from
his
island
country,
and
she
urged
him
with
an
enthusiasm
of
curiosity,
which
ere
long
thawed
Hunsden's
reserve
as
fire
thaws
a
congealed
viper.
I
use
this
not
very
flattering
comparison
because
he
vividly
reminded
me
of
a
snake
waking
from
torpor,
as
he
erected
his
tall
form,
reared
his
head,
before
a
little
declined,
and
putting
back
his
hair
from
his
broad
Saxon
forehead,
showed
unshaded
the
gleam
of
almost
savage
satire
which
his
interlocutor's
tone
of
eagerness
and
look
of
ardour
had
sufficed
at
once
to
kindle
in
his
soul
and
elicit
from
his
eyes:
he
was
himself;
as
Frances
was
herself,
and
in
none
but
his
own
language
would
he
now
address
her.
"You
understand
English?"
was
the
prefatory
question.
"A
little."
"Well,
then,
you
shall
have
plenty
of
it;
and
first,
I
see
you've
not
much
more
sense
than
some
others
of
my
acquaintance"
(indicating
me
with
his
thumb),
"or
else
you'd
never
turn
rabid
about
that
dirty
little
country
called
England;
for
rabid,
I
see
you
are;
I
read
Anglophobia
in
your
looks,
and
hear
it
in
your
words.
Why,
mademoiselle,
is
it
possible
that
anybody
with
a
grain
of
rationality
should
feel
enthusiasm
about
a
mere
name,
and
that
name
England?
I
thought
you
were
a
lady
abbess
five
minutes
ago,
and
respected
you
accordingly;
and
now
I
see
you
are
a
sort
of
Swiss
sibyl,
with
high
Tory
and
high
Church
principles!"
"England
is
your
country?"
asked
Frances.
"Yes."
"And
you
don't
like
it?"
"I'd
be
sorry
to
like
it!
A
little
corrupt,
venal,
lord
and
king
cursed
nation,
full
of
mucky
pride
(as
they
say
in
shire),
and
helpless
pauperism;
rotten
with
abuses,
worm
eaten
with
prejudices!"
"You
might
say
so
of
almost
every
state;
there
are
abuses
and
prejudices
everywhere,
and
I
thought
fewer
in
England
than
in
other
countries."
"Come
to
England
and
see.
Come
to
Birmingham
and
Manchester;
come
to
St.
Giles'
in
London,
and
get
a
practical
notion
of
how
our
system
works.
Examine
the
footprints
of
our
august
aristocracy;
see
how
they
walk
in
blood,
crushing
hearts
as
they
go.
Just
put
your
head
in
at
English
cottage
doors;
get
a
glimpse
of
Famine
crouched
torpid
on
black
hearthstones;
of
Disease
lying
bare
on
beds
without
coverlets,
of
Infamy
wantoning
viciously
with
Ignorance,
though
indeed
Luxury
is
her
favourite
paramour,
and
princely
halls
are
dearer
to
her
than
thatched
hovels
"
"I
was
not
thinking
of
the
wretchedness
and
vice
in
England;
I
was
thinking
of
the
good
side
of
what
is
elevated
in
your
character
as
a
nation."
"There
is
no
good
side
none
at
least
of
which
you
can
have
any
knowledge;
for
you
cannot
appreciate
the
efforts
of
industry,
the
achievements
of
enterprise,
or
the
discoveries
of
science:
narrowness
of
education
and
obscurity
of
position
quite
incapacitate
you
from
understanding
these
points;
and
as
to
historical
and
poetical
associations,
I
will
not
insult
you,
mademoiselle,
by
supposing
that
you
alluded
to
such
humbug."
"But
I
did
partly."
Hunsden
laughed
his
laugh
of
unmitigated
scorn.
"I
did,
Mr.
Hunsden.
Are
you
of
the
number
of
those
to
whom
such
associations
give
no
pleasure?"
"Mademoiselle,
what
is
an
association?
I
never
saw
one.
What
is
its
length,
breadth,
weight,
value
ay,
VALUE?
What
price
will
it
bring
in
the
market?"
"Your
portrait,
to
any
one
who
loved
you,
would,
for
the
sake
of
association,
be
without
price."
That
inscrutable
Hunsden
heard
this
remark
and
felt
it
rather
acutely,
too,
somewhere;
for
he
coloured
a
thing
not
unusual
with
him,
when
hit
unawares
on
a
tender
point.
A
sort
of
trouble
momentarily
darkened
his
eye,
and
I
believe
he
filled
up
the
transient
pause
succeeding
his
antagonist's
home
thrust,
by
a
wish
that
some
one
did
love
him
as
he
would
like
to
be
loved
some
one
whose
love
he
could
unreservedly
return.
The
lady
pursued
her
temporary
advantage.
"If
your
world
is
a
world
without
associations,
Mr.
Hunsden,
I
no
longer
wonder
that
you
hate
England
so.
I
don't
clearly
know
what
Paradise
is,
and
what
angels
are;
yet
taking
it
to
be
the
most
glorious
region
I
can
conceive,
and
angels
the
most
elevated
existences
if
one
of
them
if
Abdiel
the
Faithful
himself"
(she
was
thinking
of
Milton)
"were
suddenly
stripped
of
the
faculty
of
association,
I
think
he
would
soon
rush
forth
from
'the
ever
during
gates,'
leave
heaven,
and
seek
what
he
had
lost
in
hell.
Yes,
in
the
very
hell
from
which
he
turned
'with
retorted
scorn.'"
Frances'
tone
in
saying
this
was
as
marked
as
her
language,
and
it
was
when
the
word
"hell"
twanged
off
from
her
lips,
with
a
somewhat
startling
emphasis,
that
Hunsden
deigned
to
bestow
one
slight
glance
of
admiration.
He
liked
something
strong,
whether
in
man
or
woman;
he
liked
whatever
dared
to
clear
conventional
limits.
He
had
never
before
heard
a
lady
say
"hell"
with
that
uncompromising
sort
of
accent,
and
the
sound
pleased
him
from
a
lady's
lips;
he
would
fain
have
had
Frances
to
strike
the
string
again,
but
it
was
not
in
her
way.
The
display
of
eccentric
vigour
never
gave
her
pleasure,
and
it
only
sounded
in
her
voice
or
flashed
in
her
countenance
when
extraordinary
circumstances
and
those
generally
painful
forced
it
out
of
the
depths
where
it
burned
latent.
To
me,
once
or
twice,
she
had
in
intimate
conversation,
uttered
venturous
thoughts
in
nervous
language;
but
when
the
hour
of
such
manifestation
was
past,
I
could
not
recall
it;
it
came
of
itself
and
of
itself
departed.
Hunsden's
excitations
she
put
by
soon
with
a
smile,
and
recurring
to
the
theme
of
disputation,
said
"Since
England
is
nothing,
why
do
the
continental
nations
respect
her
so?"
"I
should
have
thought
no
child
would
have
asked
that
question,"
replied
Hunsden,
who
never
at
any
time
gave
information
without
reproving
for
stupidity
those
who
asked
it
of
him.
"If
you
had
been
my
pupil,
as
I
suppose
you
once
had
the
misfortune
to
be
that
of
a
deplorable
character
not
a
hundred
miles
off,
I
would
have
put
you
in
the
corner
for
such
a
confession
of
ignorance.
Why,
mademoiselle,
can't
you
see
that
it
is
our
GOLD
which
buys
us
French
politeness,
German
good
will,
and
Swiss
servility?"
And
he
sneered
diabolically.
"Swiss?"
said
Frances,
catching
the
word
"servility."
"Do
you
call
my
countrymen
servile?"
and
she
started
up.
I
could
not
suppress
a
low
laugh;
there
was
ire
in
her
glance
and
defiance
in
her
attitude.
"Do
you
abuse
Switzerland
to
me,
Mr.
Hunsden?
Do
you
think
I
have
no
associations?
Do
you
calculate
that
I
am
prepared
to
dwell
only
on
what
vice
and
degradation
may
be
found
in
Alpine
villages,
and
to
leave
quite
out
of
my
heart
the
social
greatness
of
my
countrymen,
and
our
blood
earned
freedom,
and
the
natural
glories
of
our
mountains?
You're
mistaken
you're
mistaken."
"Social
greatness?
Call
it
what
you
will,
your
countrymen
are
sensible
fellows;
they
make
a
marketable
article
of
what
to
you
is
an
abstract
idea;
they
have,
ere
this,
sold
their
social
greatness
and
also
their
blood
earned
freedom
to
be
the
servants
of
foreign
kings."
"You
never
were
in
Switzerland?"
"Yes
I
have
been
there
twice."
"You
know
nothing
of
it."
"I
do."
"And
you
say
the
Swiss
are
mercenary,
as
a
parrot
says
'Poor
Poll,'
or
as
the
Belgians
here
say
the
English
are
not
brave,
or
as
the
French
accuse
them
of
being
perfidious:
there
is
no
justice
in
your
dictums."
"There
is
truth."
"I
tell
you,
Mr.
Hunsden,
you
are
a
more
unpractical
man
than
I
am
an
unpractical
woman,
for
you
don't
acknowledge
what
really
exists;
you
want
to
annihilate
individual
patriotism
and
national
greatness
as
an
atheist
would
annihilate
God
and
his
own
soul,
by
denying
their
existence."
"Where
are
you
flying
to?
You
are
off
at
a
tangent
I
thought
we
were
talking
about
the
mercenary
nature
of
the
Swiss."
"We
were
and
if
you
proved
to
me
that
the
Swiss
are
mercenary
to
morrow
(which
you
cannot
do)
I
should
love
Switzerland
still."
"You
would
be
mad,
then
mad
as
a
March
hare
to
indulge
in
a
passion
for
millions
of
shiploads
of
soil,
timber,
snow,
and
ice."
"Not
so
mad
as
you
who
love
nothing."
"There's
a
method
in
my
madness;
there's
none
in
yours."
"Your
method
is
to
squeeze
the
sap
out
of
creation
and
make
manure
of
the
refuse,
by
way
of
turning
it
to
what
you
call
use."
"You
cannot
reason
at
all,"
said
Hunsden;
"there
is
no
logic
in
you."
"Better
to
be
without
logic
than
without
feeling,"
retorted
Frances,
who
was
now
passing
backwards
and
forwards
from
her
cupboard
to
the
table,
intent,
if
not
on
hospitable
thoughts,
at
least
on
hospitable
deeds,
for
she
was
laying
the
cloth,
and
putting
plates,
knives
and
forks
thereon.
"Is
that
a
hit
at
me,
mademoiselle?
Do
you
suppose
I
am
without
feeling?"
"I
suppose
you
are
always
interfering
with
your
own
feelings,
and
those
of
other
people,
and
dogmatizing
about
the
irrationality
of
this,
that,
and
the
other
sentiment,
and
then
ordering
it
to
be
suppressed
because
you
imagine
it
to
be
inconsistent
with
logic."
"I
do
right."
Frances
had
stepped
out
of
sight
into
a
sort
of
little
pantry;
she
soon
reappeared.
"You
do
right?
Indeed,
no!
You
are
much
mistaken
if
you
think
so.
Just
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
get
to
the
fire,
Mr.
Hunsden;
I
have
something
to
cook."
(An
interval
occupied
in
settling
a
casserole
on
the
fire;
then,
while
she
stirred
its
contents:)
"Right!
as
if
it
were
right
to
crush
any
pleasurable
sentiment
that
God
has
given
to
man,
especially
any
sentiment
that,
like
patriotism,
spreads
man's
selfishness
in
wider
circles"
(fire
stirred,
dish
put
down
before
it).
"Were
you
born
in
Switzerland?"
"I
should
think
so,
or
else
why
should
I
call
it
my
country?"
"And
where
did
you
get
your
English
features
and
figure?"
"I
am
English,
too;
half
the
blood
in
my
veins
is
English;
thus
I
have
a
right
to
a
double
power
of
patriotism,
possessing
an
interest
in
two
noble,
free,
and
fortunate
countries."
"You
had
an
English
mother?"
"Yes,
yes;
and
you,
I
suppose,
had
a
mother
from
the
moon
or
from
Utopia,
since
not
a
nation
in
Europe
has
a
claim
on
your
interest?"
"On
the
contrary,
I'm
a
universal
patriot,
if
you
could
understand
me
rightly:
my
country
is
the
world."
"Sympathies
so
widely
diffused
must
be
very
shallow:
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
come
to
table.
Monsieur"
(to
me
who
appeared
to
be
now
absorbed
in
reading
by
moonlight)
"Monsieur,
supper
is
served."
This
was
said
in
quite
a
different
voice
to
that
in
which
she
had
been
bandying
phrases
with
Mr.
Hunsden
not
so
short,
graver
and
softer.
"Frances,
what
do
you
mean
by
preparing,
supper?
we
had
no
intention
of
staying."
"Ah,
monsieur,
but
you
have
stayed,
and
supper
is
prepared;
you
have
only
the
alternative
of
eating
it."
The
meal
was
a
foreign
one,
of
course;
it
consisted
in
two
small
but
tasty
dishes
of
meat
prepared
with
skill
and
served
with
nicety;
a
salad
and
"fromage
francais,"
completed
it.
The
business
of
eating
interposed
a
brief
truce
between
the
belligerents,
but
no
sooner
was
supper
disposed
of
than
they
were
at
it
again.
The
fresh
subject
of
dispute
ran
on
the
spirit
of
religious
intolerance
which
Mr.
Hunsden
affirmed
to
exist
strongly
in
Switzerland,
notwithstanding
the
professed
attachment
of
the
Swiss
to
freedom.
Here
Frances
had
greatly
the
worst
of
it,
not
only
because
she
was
unskilled
to
argue,
but
because
her
own
real
opinions
on
the
point
in
question
happened
to
coincide
pretty
nearly
with
Mr.
Hunsden's,
and
she
only
contradicted
him
out
of
opposition.
At
last
she
gave
in,
confessing
that
she
thought
as
he
thought,
but
bidding
him
take
notice
that
she
did
not
consider
herself
beaten.
"No
more
did
the
French
at
Waterloo,"
said
Hunsden.
"There
is
no
comparison
between
the
cases,"
rejoined
Frances;
"mine
was
a
sham
fight."
"Sham
or
real,
it's
up
with
you."
"No;
though
I
have
neither
logic
nor
wealth
of
words,
yet
in
a
case
where
my
opinion
really
differed
from
yours,
I
would
adhere
to
it
when
I
had
not
another
word
to
say
in
its
defence;
you
should
be
baffled
by
dumb
determination.
You
speak
of
Waterloo;
your
Wellington
ought
to
have
been
conquered
there,
according
to
Napoleon;
but
he
persevered
in
spite
of
the
laws
of
war,
and
was
victorious
in
defiance
of
military
tactics.
I
would
do
as
he
did."
"I'll
be
bound
for
it
you
would;
probably
you
have
some
of
the
same
sort
of
stubborn
stuff
in
you."
"I
should
be
sorry
if
I
had
not;
he
and
Tell
were
brothers,
and
I'd
scorn
the
Swiss,
man
or
woman,
who
had
none
of
the
much
enduring
nature
of
our
heroic
William
in
his
soul."
"If
Tell
was
like
Wellington,
he
was
an
ass."
"Does
not
ASS
mean
BAUDET?"
asked
Frances,
turning
to
me.
"No,
no,"
replied
I,
"it
means
an
ESPRIT
FORT;
and
now,"
I
continued,
as
I
saw
that
fresh
occasion
of
strife
was
brewing
between
these
two,
"it
is
high
time
to
go."
Hunsden
rose.
"Good
bye,"
said
he
to
Frances;
"I
shall
be
off
for
this
glorious
England
to
morrow,
and
it
may
be
twelve
months
or
more
before
I
come
to
Brussels
again;
whenever
I
do
come
I'll
seek
you
out,
and
you
shall
see
if
I
don't
find
means
to
make
you
fiercer
than
a
dragon.
You've
done
pretty
well
this
evening,
but
next
interview
you
shall
challenge
me
outright.
Meantime
you're
doomed
to
become
Mrs.
William
Crimsworth,
I
suppose;
poor
young
lady?
but
you
have
a
spark
of
spirit;
cherish
it,
and
give
the
Professor
the
full
benefit
thereof."
"Are
you
married.
Mr.
Hunsden?"
asked
Frances,
suddenly.
"No.
I
should
have
thought
you
might
have
guessed
I
was
a
Benedict
by
my
look."
"Well,
whenever
you
marry
don't
take
a
wife
out
of
Switzerland;
for
if
you
begin
blaspheming
Helvetia,
and
cursing
the
cantons
above
all,
if
you
mention
the
word
ASS
in
the
same
breath
with
the
name
Tell
(for
ass
IS
baudet,
I
know;
though
Monsieur
is
pleased
to
translate
it
ESPRIT
FORT)
your
mountain
maid
will
some
night
smother
her
Breton
bretonnant,
even
as
your
own
Shakspeare's
Othello
smothered
Desdemona."
"I
am
warned,"
said
Hunsden;
"and
so
are
you,
lad,"
(nodding
to
me).
"I
hope
yet
to
hear
of
a
travesty
of
the
Moor
and
his
gentle
lady,
in
which
the
parts
shall
be
reversed
according
to
the
plan
just
sketched
you,
however,
being
in
my
nightcap.
Farewell,
mademoiselle!"
He
bowed
on
her
hand,
absolutely
like
Sir
Charles
Grandison
on
that
of
Harriet
Byron;
adding
"Death
from
such
fingers
would
not
be
without
charms."
"Mon
Dieu!"
murmured
Frances,
opening
her
large
eyes
and
lifting
her
distinctly
arched
brows;
"c'est
qu'il
fait
des
compliments!
je
ne
m'y
suis
pas
attendu."
She
smiled,
half
in
ire,
half
in
mirth,
curtsied
with
foreign
grace,
and
so
they
parted.
No
sooner
had
we
got
into
the
street
than
Hunsden
collared
me.
"And
that
is
your
lace
mender?"
said
he;
"and
you
reckon
you
have
done
a
fine,
magnanimous
thing
in
offering
to
marry
her?
You,
a
scion
of
Seacombe,
have
proved
your
disdain
of
social
distinctions
by
taking
up
with
an
ouvriere!
And
I
pitied
the
fellow,
thinking
his
feelings
had
misled
him,
and
that
he
had
hurt
himself
by
contracting
a
low
match!"
"Just
let
go
my
collar,
Hunsden."
On
the
contrary,
he
swayed
me
to
and
fro;
so
I
grappled
him
round
the
waist.
It
was
dark;
the
street
lonely
and
lampless.
We
had
then
a
tug
for
it;
and
after
we
had
both
rolled
on
the
pavement,
and
with
difficulty
picked
ourselves
up,
we
agreed
to
walk
on
more
soberly.
"Yes,
that's
my
lace
mender,"
said
I;
"and
she
is
to
be
mine
for
life
God
willing."
"God
is
not
willing
you
can't
suppose
it;
what
business
have
you
to
be
suited
so
well
with
a
partner?
And
she
treats
you
with
a
sort
of
respect,
too,
and
says,
'Monsieur'
and
modulates
her
tone
in
addressing
you,
actually,
as
if
you
were
something
superior!
She
could
not
evince
more
deference
to
such
a
one
as
I,
were
she
favoured
by
fortune
to
the
supreme
extent
of
being
my
choice
instead
of
yours."
"Hunsden,
you're
a
puppy.
But
you've
only
seen
the
title
page
of
my
happiness;
you
don't
know
the
tale
that
follows;
you
cannot
conceive
the
interest
and
sweet
variety
and
thrilling
excitement
of
the
narrative."
Hunsden
speaking
low
and
deep,
for
we
had
now
entered
a
busier
street
desired
me
to
hold
my
peace,
threatening
to
do
something
dreadful
if
I
stimulated
his
wrath
further
by
boasting.
I
laughed
till
my
sides
ached.
We
soon
reached
his
hotel;
before
he
entered
it,
he
said
"Don't
be
vainglorious.
Your
lace
mender
is
too
good
for
you,
but
not
good
enough
for
me;
neither
physically
nor
morally
does
she
come
up
to
my
ideal
of
a
woman.
No;
I
dream
of
something
far
beyond
that
pale
faced,
excitable
little
Helvetian
(by
the
by
she
has
infinitely
more
of
the
nervous,
mobile
Parisienne
in
her
than
of
the
the
robust
'jungfrau').
Your
Mdlle.
Henri
is
in
person
"chetive",
in
mind
"sans
caractere",
compared
with
the
queen
of
my
visions.
You,
indeed,
may
put
up
with
that
"minois
chiffone";
but
when
I
marry
I
must
have
straighter
and
more
harmonious
features,
to
say
nothing
of
a
nobler
and
better
developed
shape
than
that
perverse,
ill
thriven
child
can
boast."
"Bribe
a
seraph
to
fetch
you
a
coal
of
fire
from
heaven,
if
you
will,"
said
I,
"and
with
it
kindle
life
in
the
tallest,
fattest,
most
boneless,
fullest
blooded
of
Ruben's
painted
women
leave
me
only
my
Alpine
peri,
and
I'll
not
envy
you."
With
a
simultaneous
movement,
each
turned
his
back
on
the
other.
Neither
said
"God
bless
you;"
yet
on
the
morrow
the
sea
was
to
roll
between
us.
IN
two
months
more
Frances
had
fulfilled
the
time
of
mourning
for
her
aunt.
One
January
morning
the
first
of
the
new
year
holidays
I
went
in
a
fiacre,
accompanied
only
by
M.
Vandenhuten,
to
the
Rue
Notre
Dame
aux
Neiges,
and
having
alighted
alone
and
walked
upstairs,
I
found
Frances
apparently
waiting
for
me,
dressed
in
a
style
scarcely
appropriate
to
that
cold,
bright,
frosty
day.
Never
till
now
had
I
seen
her
attired
in
any
other
than
black
or
sad
coloured
stuff;
and
there
she
stood
by
the
window,
clad
all
in
white,
and
white
of
a
most
diaphanous
texture;
her
array
was
very
simple,
to
be
sure,
but
it
looked
imposing
and
festal
because
it
was
so
clear,
full,
and
floating;
a
veil
shadowed
her
head,
and
hung
below
her
knee;
a
little
wreath
of
pink
flowers
fastened
it
to
her
thickly
tressed
Grecian
plait,
and
thence
it
fell
softly
on
each
side
of
her
face.
Singular
to
state,
she
was,
or
had
been
crying;
when
I
asked
her
if
she
were
ready,
she
said
"Yes,
monsieur,"
with
something
very
like
a
checked
sob;
and
when
I
took
a
shawl,
which
lay
on
the
table,
and
folded
it
round
her,
not
only
did
tear
after
tear
course
unbidden
down
her
cheek,
but
she
shook
to
my
ministration
like
a
reed.
I
said
I
was
sorry
to
see
her
in
such
low
spirits,
and
requested
to
be
allowed
an
insight
into
the
origin
thereof.
She
only
said,
"It
was
impossible
to
help
it,"
and
then
voluntarily,
though
hurriedly,
putting
her
hand
into
mine,
accompanied
me
out
of
the
room,
and
ran
downstairs
with
a
quick,
uncertain
step,
like
one
who
was
eager
to
get
some
formidable
piece
of
business
over.
I
put
her
into
the
fiacre.
M.
Vandenhuten
received
her,
and
seated
her
beside
himself;
we
drove
all
together
to
the
Protestant
chapel,
went
through
a
certain
service
in
the
Common
Prayer
Book,
and
she
and
I
came
out
married.
M.
Vandenhuten
had
given
the
bride
away.
We
took
no
bridal
trip;
our
modesty,
screened
by
the
peaceful
obscurity
of
our
station,
and
the
pleasant
isolation
of
our
circumstances,
did
not
exact
that
additional
precaution.
We
repaired
at
once
to
a
small
house
I
had
taken
in
the
faubourg
nearest
to
that
part
of
the
city
where
the
scene
of
our
avocations
lay.
Three
or
four
hours
after
the
wedding
ceremony,
Frances,
divested
of
her
bridal
snow,
and
attired
in
a
pretty
lilac
gown
of
warmer
materials,
a
piquant
black
silk
apron,
and
a
lace
collar
with
some
finishing
decoration
of
lilac
ribbon,
was
kneeling
on
the
carpet
of
a
neatly
furnished
though
not
spacious
parlour,
arranging
on
the
shelves
of
a
chiffoniere
some
books,
which
I
handed
to
her
from
the
table.
It
was
snowing
fast
out
of
doors;
the
afternoon
had
turned
out
wild
and
cold;
the
leaden
sky
seemed
full
of
drifts,
and
the
street
was
already
ankle
deep
in
the
white
downfall.
Our
fire
burned
bright,
our
new
habitation
looked
brilliantly
clean
and
fresh,
the
furniture
was
all
arranged,
and
there
were
but
some
articles
of
glass,
china,
books,
&c.,
to
put
in
order.
Frances
found
in
this
business
occupation
till
tea
time,
and
then,
after
I
had
distinctly
instructed
her
how
to
make
a
cup
of
tea
in
rational
English
style,
and
after
she
had
got
over
the
dismay
occasioned
by
seeing
such
an
extravagant
amount
of
material
put
into
the
pot,
she
administered
to
me
a
proper
British
repast,
at
which
there
wanted
neither
candles
nor
urn,
firelight
nor
comfort.
Our
week's
holiday
glided
by,
and
we
readdressed
ourselves
to
labour.
Both
my
wife
and
I
began
in
good
earnest
with
the
notion
that
we
were
working
people,
destined
to
earn
our
bread
by
exertion,
and
that
of
the
most
assiduous
kind.
Our
days
were
thoroughly
occupied;
we
used
to
part
every
morning
at
eight
o'clock,
and
not
meet
again
till
five
P.M.;
but
into
what
sweet
rest
did
the
turmoil
of
each
busy
day
decline!
Looking
down
the
vista
of
memory,
I
see
the
evenings
passed
in
that
little
parlour
like
a
long
string
of
rubies
circling
the
dusky
brow
of
the
past.
Unvaried
were
they
as
each
cut
gem,
and
like
each
gem
brilliant
and
burning.
A
year
and
a
half
passed.
One
morning
(it
was
a
FETE,
and
we
had
the
day
to
ourselves)
Frances
said
to
me,
with
a
suddenness
peculiar
to
her
when
she
had
been
thinking
long
on
a
subject,
and
at
last,
having
come
to
a
conclusion,
wished
to
test
its
soundness
by
the
touchstone
of
my
judgment:
"I
don't
work
enough."
"What
now?"
demanded
I,
looking
up
from
my
coffee,
which
I
had
been
deliberately
stirring
while
enjoying,
in
anticipation,
a
walk
I
proposed
to
take
with
Frances,
that
fine
summer
day
(it
was
June),
to
a
certain
farmhouse
in
the
country,
where
we
were
to
dine.
"What
now?"
and
I
saw
at
once,
in
the
serious
ardour
of
her
face,
a
project
of
vital
importance.
"I
am
not
satisfied,"
returned
she:
"you
are
now
earning
eight
thousand
francs
a
year"
(it
was
true;
my
efforts,
punctuality,
the
fame
of
my
pupils'
progress,
the
publicity
of
my
station,
had
so
far
helped
me
on),
"while
I
am
still
at
my
miserable
twelve
hundred
francs.
I
CAN
do
better,
and
I
WILL."
"You
work
as
long
and
as
diligently
as
I
do,
Frances."
"Yes,
monsieur,
but
I
am
not
working
in
the
right
way,
and
I
am
convinced
of
it."
"You
wish
to
change
you
have
a
plan
for
progress
in
your
mind;
go
and
put
on
your
bonnet;
and,
while
we
take
our
walk,
you
shall
tell
me
of
it."
"Yes,
monsieur."
She
went
as
docile
as
a
well
trained
child;
she
was
a
curious
mixture
of
tractability
and
firmness:
I
sat
thinking
about
her,
and
wondering
what
her
plan
could
be,
when
she
re
entered.
"Monsieur,
I
have
given
Minnie"
(our
bonne)
"leave
to
go
out
too,
as
it
is
so
very
fine;
so
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
lock
the
door,
and
take
the
key
with
you?"
"Kiss
me,
Mrs.
Crimsworth,"
was
my
not
very
apposite
reply;
but
she
looked
so
engaging
in
her
light
summer
dress
and
little
cottage
bonnet,
and
her
manner
in
speaking
to
me
was
then,
as
always,
so
unaffectedly
and
suavely
respectful,
that
my
heart
expanded
at
the
sight
of
her,
and
a
kiss
seemed
necessary
to
content
its
importunity.
"There,
monsieur."
"Why
do
you
always
call
me
'Monsieur'?
Say,
'William.'"
"I
cannot
pronounce
your
W;
besides,
'Monsieur'
belongs
to
you;
I
like
it
best."
Minnie
having
departed
in
clean
cap
and
smart
shawl,
we,
too,
set
out,
leaving
the
house
solitary
and
silent
silent,
at
least,
but
for
the
ticking
of
the
clock.
We
were
soon
clear
of
Brussels;
the
fields
received
us,
and
then
the
lanes,
remote
from
carriage
resounding
CHAUSSEES.
Ere
long
we
came
upon
a
nook,
so
rural,
green,
and
secluded,
it
might
have
been
a
spot
in
some
pastoral
English
province;
a
bank
of
short
and
mossy
grass,
under
a
hawthorn,
offered
a
seat
too
tempting
to
be
declined;
we
took
it,
and
when
we
had
admired
and
examined
some
English
looking
wild
flowers
growing
at
our
feet,
I
recalled
Frances'
attention
and
my
own
to
the
topic
touched
on
at
breakfast.
"What
was
her
plan?"
A
natural
one
the
next
step
to
be
mounted
by
us,
or,
at
least,
by
her,
if
she
wanted
to
rise
in
her
profession.
She
proposed
to
begin
a
school.
We
already
had
the
means
for
commencing
on
a
careful
scale,
having
lived
greatly
within
our
income.
We
possessed,
too,
by
this
time,
an
extensive
and
eligible
connection,
in
the
sense
advantageous
to
our
business;
for,
though
our
circle
of
visiting
acquaintance
continued
as
limited
as
ever,
we
were
now
widely
known
in
schools
and
families
as
teachers.
When
Frances
had
developed
her
plan,
she
intimated,
in
some
closing
sentences,
her
hopes
for
the
future.
If
we
only
had
good
health
and
tolerable
success,
me
might,
she
was
sure,
in
time
realize
an
independency;
and
that,
perhaps,
before
we
were
too
old
to
enjoy
it;
then
both
she
and
I
would
rest;
and
what
was
to
hinder
us
from
going
to
live
in
England?
England
was
still
her
Promised
Land.
I
put
no
obstacle
in
her
way;
raised
no
objection;
I
knew
she
was
not
one
who
could
live
quiescent
and
inactive,
or
even
comparatively
inactive.
Duties
she
must
have
to
fulfil,
and
important
duties;
work
to
do
and
exciting,
absorbing,
profitable
work;
strong
faculties
stirred
in
her
frame,
and
they
demanded
full
nourishment,
free
exercise:
mine
was
not
the
hand
ever
to
starve
or
cramp
them;
no,
I
delighted
in
offering
them
sustenance,
and
in
clearing
them
wider
space
for
action.
"You
have
conceived
a
plan,
Frances,"
said
I,
"and
a
good
plan;
execute
it;
you
have
my
free
consent,
and
wherever
and
whenever
my
assistance
is
wanted,
ask
and
you
shall
have."
Frances'
eyes
thanked
me
almost
with
tears;
just
a
sparkle
or
two,
soon
brushed
away;
she
possessed
herself
of
my
hand
too,
and
held
it
for
some
time
very
close
clasped
in
both
her
own,
but
she
said
no
more
than
"Thank
you,
monsieur."
We
passed
a
divine
day,
and
came
home
late,
lighted
by
a
full
summer
moon.
Ten
years
rushed
now
upon
me
with
dusty,
vibrating,
unresting
wings;
years
of
bustle,
action,
unslacked
endeavour;
years
in
which
I
and
my
wife,
having
launched
ourselves
in
the
full
career
of
progress,
as
progress
whirls
on
in
European
capitals,
scarcely
knew
repose,
were
strangers
to
amusement,
never
thought
of
indulgence,
and
yet,
as
our
course
ran
side
by
side,
as
we
marched
hand
in
hand,
we
neither
murmured,
repented,
nor
faltered.
Hope
indeed
cheered
us;
health
kept
us
up;
harmony
of
thought
and
deed
smoothed
many
difficulties,
and
finally,
success
bestowed
every
now
and
then
encouraging
reward
on
diligence.
Our
school
became
one
of
the
most
popular
in
Brussels,
and
as
by
degrees
we
raised
our
terms
and
elevated
our
system
of
education,
our
choice
of
pupils
grew
more
select,
and
at
length
included
the
children
of
the
best
families
in
Belgium.
We
had
too
an
excellent
connection
in
England,
first
opened
by
the
unsolicited
recommendation
of
Mr.
Hunsden,
who
having
been
over,
and
having
abused
me
for
my
prosperity
in
set
terms,
went
back,
and
soon
after
sent
a
leash
of
young
shire
heiresses
his
cousins;
as
he
said
"to
be
polished
off
by
Mrs.
Crimsworth."
As
to
this
same
Mrs.
Crimsworth,
in
one
sense
she
was
become
another
woman,
though
in
another
she
remained
unchanged.
So
different
was
she
under
different
circumstances.
I
seemed
to
possess
two
wives.
The
faculties
of
her
nature,
already
disclosed
when
I
married
her,
remained
fresh
and
fair;
but
other
faculties
shot
up
strong,
branched
out
broad,
and
quite
altered
the
external
character
of
the
plant.
Firmness,
activity,
and
enterprise,
covered
with
grave
foliage,
poetic
feeling
and
fervour;
but
these
flowers
were
still
there,
preserved
pure
and
dewy
under
the
umbrage
of
later
growth
and
hardier
nature:
perhaps
I
only
in
the
world
knew
the
secret
of
their
existence,
but
to
me
they
were
ever
ready
to
yield
an
exquisite
fragrance
and
present
a
beauty
as
chaste
as
radiant.
In
the
daytime
my
house
and
establishment
were
conducted
by
Madame
the
directress,
a
stately
and
elegant
woman,
bearing
much
anxious
thought
on
her
large
brow;
much
calculated
dignity
in
her
serious
mien:
immediately
after
breakfast
I
used
to
part
with
this
lady;
I
went
to
my
college,
she
to
her
schoolroom;
returning
for
an
hour
in
the
course
of
the
day,
I
found
her
always
in
class,
intently
occupied;
silence,
industry,
observance,
attending
on
her
presence.
When
not
actually
teaching,
she
was
overlooking
and
guiding
by
eye
and
gesture;
she
then
appeared
vigilant
and
solicitous.
When
communicating
instruction,
her
aspect
was
more
animated;
she
seemed
to
feel
a
certain
enjoyment
in
the
occupation.
The
language
in
which
she
addressed
her
pupils,
though
simple
and
unpretending,
was
never
trite
or
dry;
she
did
not
speak
from
routine
formulas
she
made
her
own
phrases
as
she
went
on,
and
very
nervous
and
impressive
phrases
they
frequently
were;
often,
when
elucidating
favourite
points
of
history,
or
geography,
she
would
wax
genuinely
eloquent
in
her
earnestness.
Her
pupils,
or
at
least
the
elder
and
more
intelligent
amongst
them,
recognized
well
the
language
of
a
superior
mind;
they
felt
too,
and
some
of
them
received
the
impression
of
elevated
sentiments;
there
was
little
fondling
between
mistress
and
girls,
but
some
of
Frances'
pupils
in
time
learnt
to
love
her
sincerely,
all
of
them
beheld
her
with
respect;
her
general
demeanour
towards
them
was
serious;
sometimes
benignant
when
they
pleased
her
with
their
progress
and
attention,
always
scrupulously
refined
and
considerate.
In
cases
where
reproof
or
punishment
was
called
for
she
was
usually
forbearing
enough;
but
if
any
took
advantage
of
that
forbearance,
which
sometimes
happened,
a
sharp,
sudden
and
lightning
like
severity
taught
the
culprit
the
extent
of
the
mistake
committed.
Sometimes
a
gleam
of
tenderness
softened
her
eyes
and
manner,
but
this
was
rare;
only
when
a
pupil
was
sick,
or
when
it
pined
after
home,
or
in
the
case
of
some
little
motherless
child,
or
of
one
much
poorer
than
its
companions,
whose
scanty
wardrobe
and
mean
appointments
brought
on
it
the
contempt
of
the
jewelled
young
countesses
and
silk
clad
misses.
Over
such
feeble
fledglings
the
directress
spread
a
wing
of
kindliest
protection:
it
was
to
their
bedside
she
came
at
night
to
tuck
them
warmly
in;
it
was
after
them
she
looked
in
winter
to
see
that
they
always
had
a
comfortable
seat
by
the
stove;
it
was
they
who
by
turns
were
summoned
to
the
salon
to
receive
some
little
dole
of
cake
or
fruit
to
sit
on
a
footstool
at
the
fireside
to
enjoy
home
comforts,
and
almost
home
liberty,
for
an
evening
together
to
be
spoken
to
gently
and
softly,
comforted,
encouraged,
cherished
and
when
bedtime
came,
dismissed
with
a
kiss
of
true
tenderness.
As
to
Julia
and
Georgiana
G
,
daughters
of
an
English
baronet,
as
to
Mdlle.
Mathilde
de
,
heiress
of
a
Belgian
count,
and
sundry
other
children
of
patrician
race,
the
directress
was
careful
of
them
as
of
the
others,
anxious
for
their
progress,
as
for
that
of
the
rest
but
it
never
seemed
to
enter
her
head
to
distinguish
them
by
a
mark
of
preference;
one
girl
of
noble
blood
she
loved
dearly
a
young
Irish
baroness
lady
Catherine
;
but
it
was
for
her
enthusiastic
heart
and
clever
head,
for
her
generosity
and
her
genius,
the
title
and
rank
went
for
nothing.
My
afternoons
were
spent
also
in
college,
with
the
exception
of
an
hour
that
my
wife
daily
exacted
of
me
for
her
establishment,
and
with
which
she
would
not
dispense.
She
said
that
I
must
spend
that
time
amongst
her
pupils
to
learn
their
characters,
to
be
AU
COURANT
with
everything
that
was
passing
in
the
house,
to
become
interested
in
what
interested
her,
to
be
able
to
give
her
my
opinion
on
knotty
points
when
she
required
it,
and
this
she
did
constantly,
never
allowing
my
interest
in
the
pupils
to
fall
asleep,
and
never
making
any
change
of
importance
without
my
cognizance
and
consent.
She
delighted
to
sit
by
me
when
I
gave
my
lessons
(lessons
in
literature),
her
hands
folded
on
her
knee,
the
most
fixedly
attentive
of
any
present.
She
rarely
addressed
me
in
class;
when
she
did
it
was
with
an
air
of
marked
deference;
it
was
her
pleasure,
her
joy
to
make
me
still
the
master
in
all
things.
At
six
o'clock
P.M.
my
daily
labours
ceased.
I
then
came
home,
for
my
home
was
my
heaven;
ever
at
that
hour,
as
I
entered
our
private
sitting
room,
the
lady
directress
vanished
from
before
my
eyes,
and
Frances
Henri,
my
own
little
lace
mender,
was
magically
restored
to
my
arms;
much
disappointed
she
would
have
been
if
her
master
had
not
been
as
constant
to
the
tryst
as
herself,
and
if
his
truthfull
kiss
had
not
been
prompt
to
answer
her
soft,
"Bon
soir,
monsieur."
Talk
French
to
me
she
would,
and
many
a
punishment
she
has
had
for
her
wilfulness.
I
fear
the
choice
of
chastisement
must
have
been
injudicious,
for
instead
of
correcting
the
fault,
it
seemed
to
encourage
its
renewal.
Our
evenings
were
our
own;
that
recreation
was
necessary
to
refresh
our
strength
for
the
due
discharge
of
our
duties;
sometimes
we
spent
them
all
in
conversation,
and
my
young
Genevese,
now
that
she
was
thoroughly
accustomed
to
her
English
professor,
now
that
she
loved
him
too
absolutely
to
fear
him
much,
reposed
in
him
a
confidence
so
unlimited
that
topics
of
conversation
could
no
more
be
wanting
with
him
than
subjects
for
communion
with
her
own
heart.
In
those
moments,
happy
as
a
bird
with
its
mate,
she
would
show
me
what
she
had
of
vivacity,
of
mirth,
of
originality
in
her
well
dowered
nature.
She
would
show,
too,
some
stores
of
raillery,
of
"malice,"
and
would
vex,
tease,
pique
me
sometimes
about
what
she
called
my
"bizarreries
anglaises,"
my
"caprices
insulaires,"
with
a
wild
and
witty
wickedness
that
made
a
perfect
white
demon
of
her
while
it
lasted.
This
was
rare,
however,
and
the
elfish
freak
was
always
short:
sometimes
when
driven
a
little
hard
in
the
war
of
words
for
her
tongue
did
ample
justice
to
the
pith,
the
point,
the
delicacy
of
her
native
French,
in
which
language
she
always
attacked
me
I
used
to
turn
upon
her
with
my
old
decision,
and
arrest
bodily
the
sprite
that
teased
me.
Vain
idea!
no
sooner
had
I
grasped
hand
or
arm
than
the
elf
was
gone;
the
provocative
smile
quenched
in
the
expressive
brown
eyes,
and
a
ray
of
gentle
homage
shone
under
the
lids
in
its
place.
I
had
seized
a
mere
vexing
fairy,
and
found
a
submissive
and
supplicating
little
mortal
woman
in
my
arms.
Then
I
made
her
get
a
book,
and
read
English
to
me
for
an
hour
by
way
of
penance.
I
frequently
dosed
her
with
Wordsworth
in
this
way,
and
Wordsworth
steadied
her
soon;
she
had
a
difficulty
in
comprehending
his
deep,
serene,
and
sober
mind;
his
language,
too,
was
not
facile
to
her;
she
had
to
ask
questions,
to
sue
for
explanations,
to
be
like
a
child
and
a
novice,
and
to
acknowledge
me
as
her
senior
and
director.
Her
instinct
instantly
penetrated
and
possessed
the
meaning
of
more
ardent
and
imaginative
writers.
Byron
excited
her;
Scott
she
loved;
Wordsworth
only
she
puzzled
at,
wondered
over,
and
hesitated
to
pronounce
an
opinion
upon.
But
whether
she
read
to
me,
or
talked
with
me;
whether
she
teased
me
in
French,
or
entreated
me
in
English;
whether
she
jested
with
wit,
or
inquired
with
deference;
narrated
with
interest,
or
listened
with
attention;
whether
she
smiled
at
me
or
on
me,
always
at
nine
o'clock
I
was
left
abandoned.
She
would
extricate
herself
from
my
arms,
quit
my
side,
take
her
lamp,
and
be
gone.
Her
mission
was
upstairs;
I
have
followed
her
sometimes
and
watched
her.
First
she
opened
the
door
of
the
dortoir
(the
pupils'
chamber),
noiselessly
she
glided
up
the
long
room
between
the
two
rows
of
white
beds,
surveyed
all
the
sleepers;
if
any
were
wakeful,
especially
if
any
were
sad,
spoke
to
them
and
soothed
them;
stood
some
minutes
to
ascertain
that
all
was
safe
and
tranquil;
trimmed
the
watch
light
which
burned
in
the
apartment
all
night,
then
withdrew,
closing
the
door
behind
her
without
sound.
Thence
she
glided
to
our
own
chamber;
it
had
a
little
cabinet
within;
this
she
sought;
there,
too,
appeared
a
bed,
but
one,
and
that
a
very
small
one;
her
face
(the
night
I
followed
and
observed
her)
changed
as
she
approached
this
tiny
couch;
from
grave
it
warmed
to
earnest;
she
shaded
with
one
hand
the
lamp
she
held
in
the
other;
she
bent
above
the
pillow
and
hung
over
a
child
asleep;
its
slumber
(that
evening
at
least,
and
usually,
I
believe)
was
sound
and
calm;
no
tear
wet
its
dark
eyelashes;
no
fever
heated
its
round
cheek;
no
ill
dream
discomposed
its
budding
features.
Frances
gazed,
she
did
not
smile,
and
yet
the
deepest
delight
filled,
flushed
her
face;
feeling
pleasurable,
powerful,
worked
in
her
whole
frame,
which
still
was
motionless.
I
saw,
indeed,
her
heart
heave,
her
lips
were
a
little
apart,
her
breathing
grew
somewhat
hurried;
the
child
smiled;
then
at
last
the
mother
smiled
too,
and
said
in
low
soliloquy,
"God
bless
my
little
son!"
She
stooped
closer
over
him,
breathed
the
softest
of
kisses
on
his
brow,
covered
his
minute
hand
with
hers,
and
at
last
started
up
and
came
away.
I
regained
the
parlour
before
her.
Entering
it
two
minutes
later
she
said
quietly
as
she
put
down
her
extinguished
lamp
"Victor
rests
well:
he
smiled
in
his
sleep;
he
has
your
smile,
monsieur."
The
said
Victor
was
of
course
her
own
boy,
born
in
the
third
year
of
our
marriage:
his
Christian
name
had
been
given
him
in
honour
of
M.
Vandenhuten,
who
continued
always
our
trusty
and
well
beloved
friend.
Frances
was
then
a
good
and
dear
wife
to
me,
because
I
was
to
her
a
good,
just,
and
faithful
husband.
What
she
would
have
been
had
she
married
a
harsh,
envious,
careless
man
a
profligate,
a
prodigal,
a
drunkard,
or
a
tyrant
is
another
question,
and
one
which
I
once
propounded
to
her.
Her
answer,
given
after
some
reflection,
was
"I
should
have
tried
to
endure
the
evil
or
cure
it
for
awhile;
and
when
I
found
it
intolerable
and
incurable,
I
should
have
left
my
torturer
suddenly
and
silently."
"And
if
law
or
might
had
forced
you
back
again?"
"What,
to
a
drunkard,
a
profligate,
a
selfish
spendthrift,
an
unjust
fool?"
"Yes."
"I
would
have
gone
back;
again
assured
myself
whether
or
not
his
vice
and
my
misery
were
capable
of
remedy;
and
if
not,
have
left
him
again."
"And
if
again
forced
to
return,
and
compelled
to
abide?"
"I
don't
know,"
she
said,
hastily.
"Why
do
you
ask
me,
monsieur?"
I
would
have
an
answer,
because
I
saw
a
strange
kind
of
spirit
in
her
eye,
whose
voice
I
determined
to
waken.
"Monsieur,
if
a
wife's
nature
loathes
that
of
the
man
she
is
wedded
to,
marriage
must
be
slavery.
Against
slavery
all
right
thinkers
revolt,
and
though
torture
be
the
price
of
resistance,
torture
must
be
dared:
though
the
only
road
to
freedom
lie
through
the
gates
of
death,
those
gates
must
be
passed;
for
freedom
is
indispensable.
Then,
monsieur,
I
would
resist
as
far
as
my
strength
permitted;
when
that
strength
failed
I
should
be
sure
of
a
refuge.
Death
would
certainly
screen
me
both
from
bad
laws
and
their
consequences."
"Voluntary
death,
Frances?"
"No,
monsieur.
I'd
have
courage
to
live
out
every
throe
of
anguish
fate
assigned
me,
and
principle
to
contend
for
justice
and
liberty
to
the
last."
"I
see
you
would
have
made
no
patient
Grizzle.
And
now,
supposing
fate
had
merely
assigned
you
the
lot
of
an
old
maid,
what
then?
How
would
you
have
liked
celibacy?"
"Not
much,
certainly.
An
old
maid's
life
must
doubtless
be
void
and
vapid
her
heart
strained
and
empty.
Had
I
been
an
old
maid
I
should
have
spent
existence
in
efforts
to
fill
the
void
and
ease
the
aching.
I
should
have
probably
failed,
and
died
weary
and
disappointed,
despised
and
of
no
account,
like
other
single
women.
But
I'm
not
an
old
maid,"
she
added
quickly.
"I
should
have
been,
though,
but
for
my
master.
I
should
never
have
suited
any
man
but
Professor
Crimsworth
no
other
gentleman,
French,
English,
or
Belgian,
would
have
thought
me
amiable
or
handsome;
and
I
doubt
whether
I
should
have
cared
for
the
approbation
of
many
others,
if
I
could
have
obtained
it.
Now,
I
have
been
Professor
Crimsworth's
wife
eight
years,
and
what
is
he
in
my
eyes?
Is
he
honourable,
beloved
?"
She
stopped,
her
voice
was
cut
off,
her
eyes
suddenly
suffused.
She
and
I
were
standing
side
by
side;
she
threw
her
arms
round
me,
and
strained
me
to
her
heart
with
passionate
earnestness:
the
energy
of
her
whole
being
glowed
in
her
dark
and
then
dilated
eye,
and
crimsoned
her
animated
cheek;
her
look
and
movement
were
like
inspiration;
in
one
there
was
such
a
flash,
in
the
other
such
a
power.
Half
an
hour
afterwards,
when
she
had
become
calm,
I
asked
where
all
that
wild
vigour
was
gone
which
had
transformed
her
ere
while
and
made
her
glance
so
thrilling
and
ardent
her
action
so
rapid
and
strong.
She
looked
down,
smiling
softly
and
passively:
"I
cannot
tell
where
it
is
gone,
monsieur,"
said
she,
"but
I
know
that,
whenever
it
is
wanted,
it
will
come
back
again."
Behold
us
now
at
the
close
of
the
ten
years,
and
we
have
realized
an
independency.
The
rapidity
with
which
we
attained
this
end
had
its
origin
in
three
reasons:
Firstly,
we
worked
so
hard
for
it;
secondly,
we
had
no
incumbrances
to
delay
success;
thirdly,
as
soon
as
we
had
capital
to
invest,
two
well
skilled
counsellors,
one
in
Belgium,
one
in
England,
viz.
Vandenhuten
and
Hunsden,
gave
us
each
a
word
of
advice
as
to
the
sort
of
investment
to
be
chosen.
The
suggestion
made
was
judicious;
and,
being
promptly
acted
on,
the
result
proved
gainful
I
need
not
say
how
gainful;
I
communicated
details
to
Messrs.
Vandenhuten
and
Hunsden;
nobody
else
can
be
interested
in
hearing
them.
Accounts
being
wound
up,
and
our
professional
connection
disposed
of,
we
both
agreed
that,
as
mammon
was
not
our
master,
nor
his
service
that
in
which
we
desired
to
spend
our
lives;
as
our
desires
were
temperate,
and
our
habits
unostentatious,
we
had
now
abundance
to
live
on
abundance
to
leave
our
boy;
and
should
besides
always
have
a
balance
on
hand,
which,
properly
managed
by
right
sympathy
and
unselfish
activity,
might
help
philanthropy
in
her
enterprises,
and
put
solace
into
the
hand
of
charity.
To
England
we
now
resolved
to
take
wing;
we
arrived
there
safely;
Frances
realized
the
dream
of
her
lifetime.
We
spent
a
whole
summer
and
autumn
in
travelling
from
end
to
end
of
the
British
islands,
and
afterwards
passed
a
winter
in
London.
Then
we
thought
it
high
time
to
fix
our
residence.
My
heart
yearned
towards
my
native
county
of
shire;
and
it
is
in
shire
I
now
live;
it
is
in
the
library
of
my
own
home
I
am
now
writing.
That
home
lies
amid
a
sequestered
and
rather
hilly
region,
thirty
miles
removed
from
X
;
a
region
whose
verdure
the
smoke
of
mills
has
not
yet
sullied,
whose
waters
still
run
pure,
whose
swells
of
moorland
preserve
in
some
ferny
glens
that
lie
between
them
the
very
primal
wildness
of
nature,
her
moss,
her
bracken,
her
blue
bells,
her
scents
of
reed
and
heather,
her
free
and
fresh
breezes.
My
house
is
a
picturesque
and
not
too
spacious
dwelling,
with
low
and
long
windows,
a
trellised
and
leaf
veiled
porch
over
the
front
door,
just
now,
on
this
summer
evening,
looking
like
an
arch
of
roses
and
ivy.
The
garden
is
chiefly
laid
out
in
lawn,
formed
of
the
sod
of
the
hills,
with
herbage
short
and
soft
as
moss,
full
of
its
own
peculiar
flowers,
tiny
and
starlike,
imbedded
in
the
minute
embroidery
of
their
fine
foliage.
At
the
bottom
of
the
sloping
garden
there
is
a
wicket,
which
opens
upon
a
lane
as
green
as
the
lawn,
very
long,
shady,
and
little
frequented;
on
the
turf
of
this
lane
generally
appear
the
first
daisies
of
spring
whence
its
name
Daisy
Lane;
serving
also
as
a
distinction
to
the
house.
It
terminates
(the
lane
I
mean)
in
a
valley
full
of
wood;
which
wood
chiefly
oak
and
beech
spreads
shadowy
about
the
vicinage
of
a
very
old
mansion,
one
of
the
Elizabethan
structures,
much
larger,
as
well
as
more
antique
than
Daisy
Lane,
the
property
and
residence
of
an
individual
familiar
both
to
me
and
to
the
reader.
Yes,
in
Hunsden
Wood
for
so
are
those
glades
and
that
grey
building,
with
many
gables
and
more
chimneys,
named
abides
Yorke
Hunsden,
still
unmarried;
never,
I
suppose,
having
yet
found
his
ideal,
though
I
know
at
least
a
score
of
young
ladies
within
a
circuit
of
forty
miles,
who
would
be
willing
to
assist
him
in
the
search.
The
estate
fell
to
him
by
the
death
of
his
father,
five
years
since;
he
has
given
up
trade,
after
having
made
by
it
sufficient
to
pay
off
some
incumbrances
by
which
the
family
heritage
was
burdened.
I
say
he
abides
here,
but
I
do
not
think
he
is
resident
above
five
months
out
of
the
twelve;
he
wanders
from
land
to
land,
and
spends
some
part
of
each
winter
in
town:
he
frequently
brings
visitors
with
him
when
he
comes
to
shire,
and
these
visitors
are
often
foreigners;
sometimes
he
has
a
German
metaphysician,
sometimes
a
French
savant;
he
had
once
a
dissatisfied
and
savage
looking
Italian,
who
neither
sang
nor
played,
and
of
whom
Frances
affirmed
that
he
had
"tout
l'air
d'un
conspirateur."
What
English
guests
Hunsden
invites,
are
all
either
men
of
Birmingham
or
Manchester
hard
men,
seemingly
knit
up
in
one
thought,
whose
talk
is
of
free
trade.
The
foreign
visitors,
too,
are
politicians;
they
take
a
wider
theme
European
progress
the
spread
of
liberal
sentiments
over
the
Continent;
on
their
mental
tablets,
the
names
of
Russia,
Austria,
and
the
Pope,
are
inscribed
in
red
ink.
I
have
heard
some
of
them
talk
vigorous
sense
yea,
I
have
been
present
at
polyglot
discussions
in
the
old,
oak
lined
dining
room
at
Hunsden
Wood,
where
a
singular
insight
was
given
of
the
sentiments
entertained
by
resolute
minds
respecting
old
northern
despotisms,
and
old
southern
superstitions:
also,
I
have
heard
much
twaddle,
enounced
chiefly
in
French
and
Deutsch,
but
let
that
pass.
Hunsden
himself
tolerated
the
drivelling
theorists;
with
the
practical
men
he
seemed
leagued
hand
and
heart.
When
Hunsden
is
staying
alone
at
the
Wood
(which
seldom
happens)
he
generally
finds
his
way
two
or
three
times
a
week
to
Daisy
Lane.
He
has
a
philanthropic
motive
for
coming
to
smoke
his
cigar
in
our
porch
on
summer
evenings;
he
says
he
does
it
to
kill
the
earwigs
amongst
the
roses,
with
which
insects,
but
for
his
benevolent
fumigations,
he
intimates
we
should
certainly
be
overrun.
On
wet
days,
too,
we
are
almost
sure
to
see
him;
according
to
him,
it
gets
on
time
to
work
me
into
lunacy
by
treading
on
my
mental
corns,
or
to
force
from
Mrs.
Crimsworth
revelations
of
the
dragon
within
her,
by
insulting
the
memory
of
Hofer
and
Tell.
We
also
go
frequently
to
Hunsden
Wood,
and
both
I
and
Frances
relish
a
visit
there
highly.
If
there
are
other
guests,
their
characters
are
an
interesting
study;
their
conversation
is
exciting
and
strange;
the
absence
of
all
local
narrowness
both
in
the
host
and
his
chosen
society
gives
a
metropolitan,
almost
a
cosmopolitan
freedom
and
largeness
to
the
talk.
Hunsden
himself
is
a
polite
man
in
his
own
house:
he
has,
when
he
chooses
to
employ
it,
an
inexhaustible
power
of
entertaining
guests;
his
very
mansion
too
is
interesting,
the
rooms
look
storied,
the
passages
legendary,
the
low
ceiled
chambers,
with
their
long
rows
of
diamond
paned
lattices,
have
an
old
world,
haunted
air:
in
his
travels
he
has
collected
stores
of
articles
of
VERTU,
which
are
well
and
tastefully
disposed
in
his
panelled
or
tapestried
rooms:
I
have
seen
there
one
or
two
pictures,
and
one
or
two
pieces
of
statuary
which
many
an
aristocratic
connoisseur
might
have
envied.
When
I
and
Frances
have
dined
and
spent
an
evening
with
Hunsden,
he
often
walks
home
with
us.
His
wood
is
large,
and
some
of
the
timber
is
old
and
of
huge
growth.
There
are
winding
ways
in
it
which,
pursued
through
glade
and
brake,
make
the
walk
back
to
Daisy
Lane
a
somewhat
long
one.
Many
a
time,
when
we
have
had
the
benefit
of
a
full
moon,
and
when
the
night
has
been
mild
and
balmy,
when,
moreover,
a
certain
nightingale
has
been
singing,
and
a
certain
stream,
hid
in
alders,
has
lent
the
song
a
soft
accompaniment,
the
remote
church
bell
of
the
one
hamlet
in
a
district
of
ten
miles,
has
tolled
midnight
ere
the
lord
of
the
wood
left
us
at
our
porch.
Free
flowing
was
his
talk
at
such
hours,
and
far
more
quiet
and
gentle
than
in
the
day
time
and
before
numbers.
He
would
then
forget
politics
and
discussion,
and
would
dwell
on
the
past
times
of
his
house,
on
his
family
history,
on
himself
and
his
own
feelings
subjects
each
and
all
invested
with
a
peculiar
zest,
for
they
were
each
and
all
unique.
One
glorious
night
in
June,
after
I
had
been
taunting
him
about
his
ideal
bride
and
asking
him
when
she
would
come
and
graft
her
foreign
beauty
on
the
old
Hunsden
oak,
he
answered
suddenly
"You
call
her
ideal;
but
see,
here
is
her
shadow;
and
there
cannot
be
a
shadow
without
a
substance."
He
had
led
us
from
the
depth
of
the
"winding
way"
into
a
glade
from
whence
the
beeches
withdrew,
leaving
it
open
to
the
sky;
an
unclouded
moon
poured
her
light
into
this
glade,
and
Hunsden
held
out
under
her
beam
an
ivory
miniature.
Frances,
with
eagerness,
examined
it
first;
then
she
gave
it
to
me
still,
however,
pushing
her
little
face
close
to
mine,
and
seeking
in
my
eyes
what
I
thought
of
the
portrait.
I
thought
it
represented
a
very
handsome
and
very
individual
looking
female
face,
with,
as
he
had
once
said,
"straight
and
harmonious
features."
It
was
dark;
the
hair,
raven
black,
swept
not
only
from
the
brow,
but
from
the
temples
seemed
thrust
away
carelessly,
as
if
such
beauty
dispensed
with,
nay,
despised
arrangement.
The
Italian
eye
looked
straight
into
you,
and
an
independent,
determined
eye
it
was;
the
mouth
was
as
firm
as
fine;
the
chin
ditto.
On
the
back
of
the
miniature
was
gilded
"Lucia."
"That
is
a
real
head,"
was
my
conclusion.
Hunsden
smiled.
"I
think
so,"
he
replied.
"All
was
real
in
Lucia."
"And
she
was
somebody
you
would
have
liked
to
marry
but
could
not?"
"I
should
certainly
have
liked
to
marry
her,
and
that
I
HAVE
not
done
so
is
a
proof
that
I
COULD
not."
He
repossessed
himself
of
the
miniature,
now
again
in
Frances'
hand,
and
put
it
away.
"What
do
YOU
think
of
it?"
he
asked
of
my
wife,
as
he
buttoned
his
coat
over
it.
"I
am
sure
Lucia
once
wore
chains
and
broke
them,"
was
the
strange
answer.
"I
do
not
mean
matrimonial
chains,"
she
added,
correcting
herself,
as
if
she
feared
mis
interpretation,
"but
social
chains
of
some
sort.
The
face
is
that
of
one
who
has
made
an
effort,
and
a
successful
and
triumphant
effort,
to
wrest
some
vigorous
and
valued
faculty
from
insupportable
constraint;
and
when
Lucia's
faculty
got
free,
I
am
certain
it
spread
wide
pinions
and
carried
her
higher
than
"
she
hesitated.
"Than
what?"
demanded
Hunsden.
"Than
'les
convenances'
permitted
you
to
follow."
"I
think
you
grow
spiteful
impertinent."
"Lucia
has
trodden
the
stage,"
continued
Frances.
"You
never
seriously
thought
of
marrying
her;
you
admired
her
originality,
her
fearlessness,
her
energy
of
body
and
mind;
you
delighted
in
her
talent,
whatever
that
was,
whether
song,
dance,
or
dramatic
representation;
you
worshipped
her
beauty,
which
was
of
the
sort
after
your
own
heart:
but
I
am
sure
she
filled
a
sphere
from
whence
you
would
never
have
thought
of
taking
a
wife."
"Ingenious,"
remarked
Hunsden;
"whether
true
or
not
is
another
question.
Meantime,
don't
you
feel
your
little
lamp
of
a
spirit
wax
very
pale,
beside
such
a
girandole
as
Lucia's?"
"Yes."
"Candid,
at
least;
and
the
Professor
will
soon
be
dissatisfied
with
the
dim
light
you
give?"
"Will
you,
monsieur?"
"My
sight
was
always
too
weak
to
endure
a
blaze,
Frances,"
and
we
had
now
reached
the
wicket.
I
said,
a
few
pages
back,
that
this
is
a
sweet
summer
evening;
it
is
there
has
been
a
series
of
lovely
days,
and
this
is
the
loveliest;
the
hay
is
just
carried
from
my
fields,
its
perfume
still
lingers
in
the
air.
Frances
proposed
to
me,
an
hour
or
two
since,
to
take
tea
out
on
the
lawn;
I
see
the
round
table,
loaded
with
china,
placed
under
a
certain
beech;
Hunsden
is
expected
nay,
I
hear
he
is
come
there
is
his
voice,
laying
down
the
law
on
some
point
with
authority;
that
of
Frances
replies;
she
opposes
him
of
course.
They
are
disputing
about
Victor,
of
whom
Hunsden
affirms
that
his
mother
is
making
a
milksop.
Mrs.
Crimsworth
retaliates:
"Better
a
thousand
times
he
should
be
a
milksop
than
what
he,
Hunsden,
calls
'a
fine
lad;'
and
moreover
she
says
that
if
Hunsden
were
to
become
a
fixture
in
the
neighbourhood,
and
were
not
a
mere
comet,
coming
and
going,
no
one
knows
how,
when,
where,
or
why,
she
should
be
quite
uneasy
till
she
had
got
Victor
away
to
a
school
at
least
a
hundred
miles
off;
for
that
with
his
mutinous
maxims
and
unpractical
dogmas,
he
would
ruin
a
score
of
children."
I
have
a
word
to
say
of
Victor
ere
I
shut
this
manuscript
in
my
desk
but
it
must
be
a
brief
one,
for
I
hear
the
tinkle
of
silver
on
porcelain.
Victor
is
as
little
of
a
pretty
child
as
I
am
of
a
handsome
man,
or
his
mother
of
a
fine
woman;
he
is
pale
and
spare,
with
large
eyes,
as
dark
as
those
of
Frances,
and
as
deeply
set
as
mine.
His
shape
is
symmetrical
enough,
but
slight;
his
health
is
good.
I
never
saw
a
child
smile
less
than
he
does,
nor
one
who
knits
such
a
formidable
brow
when
sitting
over
a
book
that
interests
him,
or
while
listening
to
tales
of
adventure,
peril,
or
wonder,
narrated
by
his
mother,
Hunsden,
or
myself.
But
though
still,
he
is
not
unhappy
though
serious,
not
morose;
he
has
a
susceptibility
to
pleasurable
sensations
almost
too
keen,
for
it
amounts
to
enthusiasm.
He
learned
to
read
in
the
old
fashioned
way
out
of
a
spelling
book
at
his
mother's
knee,
and
as
he
got
on
without
driving
by
that
method,
she
thought
it
unnecessary
to
buy
him
ivory
letters,
or
to
try
any
of
the
other
inducements
to
learning
now
deemed
indispensable.
When
he
could
read,
he
became
a
glutton
of
books,
and
is
so
still.
His
toys
have
been
few,
and
he
has
never
wanted
more.
For
those
he
possesses,
he
seems
to
have
contracted
a
partiality
amounting
to
affection;
this
feeling,
directed
towards
one
or
two
living
animals
of
the
house,
strengthens
almost
to
a
passion.
Mr.
Hunsden
gave
him
a
mastiff
cub,
which
he
called
Yorke,
after
the
donor;
it
grew
to
a
superb
dog,
whose
fierceness,
however,
was
much
modified
by
the
companionship
and
caresses
of
its
young
master.
He
would
go
nowhere,
do
nothing
without
Yorke;
Yorke
lay
at
his
feet
while
he
learned
his
lessons,
played
with
him
in
the
garden,
walked
with
him
in
the
lane
and
wood,
sat
near
his
chair
at
meals,
was
fed
always
by
his
own
hand,
was
the
first
thing
he
sought
in
the
morning,
the
last
he
left
at
night.
Yorke
accompanied
Mr.
Hunsden
one
day
to
X
,
and
was
bitten
in
the
street
by
a
dog
in
a
rabid
state.
As
soon
as
Hunsden
had
brought
him
home,
and
had
informed
me
of
the
circumstance,
I
went
into
the
yard
and
shot
him
where
he
lay
licking
his
wound:
he
was
dead
in
an
instant;
he
had
not
seen
me
level
the
gun;
I
stood
behind
him.
I
had
scarcely
been
ten
minutes
in
the
house,
when
my
ear
was
struck
with
sounds
of
anguish:
I
repaired
to
the
yard
once
more,
for
they
proceeded
thence.
Victor
was
kneeling
beside
his
dead
mastiff,
bent
over
it,
embracing
its
bull
like
neck,
and
lost
in
a
passion
of
the
wildest
woe:
he
saw
me.
"Oh,
papa,
I'll
never
forgive
you!
I'll
never
forgive
you!"
was
his
exclamation.
"You
shot
Yorke
I
saw
it
from
the
window.
I
never
believed
you
could
be
so
cruel
I
can
love
you
no
more!"
I
had
much
ado
to
explain
to
him,
with
a
steady
voice,
the
stern
necessity
of
the
deed;
he
still,
with
that
inconsolable
and
bitter
accent
which
I
cannot
render,
but
which
pierced
my
heart,
repeated
"He
might
have
been
cured
you
should
have
tried
you
should
have
burnt
the
wound
with
a
hot
iron,
or
covered
it
with
caustic.
You
gave
no
time;
and
now
it
is
too
late
he
is
dead!"
He
sank
fairly
down
on
the
senseless
carcase;
I
waited
patiently
a
long
while,
till
his
grief
had
somewhat
exhausted
him;
and
then
I
lifted
him
in
my
arms
and
carried
him
to
his
mother,
sure
that
she
would
comfort
him
best.
She
had
witnessed
the
whole
scene
from
a
window;
she
would
not
come
out
for
fear
of
increasing
my
difficulties
by
her
emotion,
but
she
was
ready
now
to
receive
him.
She
took
him
to
her
kind
heart,
and
on
to
her
gentle
lap;
consoled
him
but
with
her
lips,
her
eyes,
her
soft
embrace,
for
some
time;
and
then,
when
his
sobs
diminished,
told
him
that
Yorke
had
felt
no
pain
in
dying,
and
that
if
he
had
been
left
to
expire
naturally,
his
end
would
have
been
most
horrible;
above
all,
she
told
him
that
I
was
not
cruel
(for
that
idea
seemed
to
give
exquisite
pain
to
poor
Victor),
that
it
was
my
affection
for
Yorke
and
him
which
had
made
me
act
so,
and
that
I
was
now
almost
heart
broken
to
see
him
weep
thus
bitterly.
Victor
would
have
been
no
true
son
of
his
father,
had
these
considerations,
these
reasons,
breathed
in
so
low,
so
sweet
a
tone
married
to
caresses
so
benign,
so
tender
to
looks
so
inspired
with
pitying
sympathy
produced
no
effect
on
him.
They
did
produce
an
effect:
he
grew
calmer,
rested
his
face
on
her
shoulder,
and
lay
still
in
her
arms.
Looking
up,
shortly,
he
asked
his
mother
to
tell
him
over
again
what
she
had
said
about
Yorke
having
suffered
no
pain,
and
my
not
being
cruel;
the
balmy
words
being
repeated,
he
again
pillowed
his
cheek
on
her
breast,
and
was
again
tranquil.
Some
hours
after,
he
came
to
me
in
my
library,
asked
if
I
forgave
him,
and
desired
to
be
reconciled.
I
drew
the
lad
to
my
side,
and
there
I
kept
him
a
good
while,
and
had
much
talk
with
him,
in
the
course
of
which
he
disclosed
many
points
of
feeling
and
thought
I
approved
of
in
my
son.
I
found,
it
is
true,
few
elements
of
the
"good
fellow"
or
the
"fine
fellow"
in
him;
scant
sparkles
of
the
spirit
which
loves
to
flash
over
the
wine
cup,
or
which
kindles
the
passions
to
a
destroying
fire;
but
I
saw
in
the
soil
of
his
heart
healthy
and
swelling
germs
of
compassion,
affection,
fidelity.
I
discovered
in
the
garden
of
his
intellect
a
rich
growth
of
wholesome
principles
reason,
justice,
moral
courage,
promised,
if
not
blighted,
a
fertile
bearing.
So
I
bestowed
on
his
large
forehead,
and
on
his
cheek
still
pale
with
tears
a
proud
and
contented
kiss,
and
sent
him
away
comforted.
Yet
I
saw
him
the
next
day
laid
on
the
mound
under
which
Yorke
had
been
buried,
his
face
covered
with
his
hands;
he
was
melancholy
for
some
weeks,
and
more
than
a
year
elapsed
before
he
would
listen
to
any
proposal
of
having
another
dog.
Victor
learns
fast.
He
must
soon
go
to
Eton,
where,
I
suspect,
his
first
year
or
two
will
be
utter
wretchedness:
to
leave
me,
his
mother,
and
his
home,
will
give
his
heart
an
agonized
wrench;
then,
the
fagging
will
not
suit
him
but
emulation,
thirst
after
knowledge,
the
glory
of
success,
will
stir
and
reward
him
in
time.
Meantime,
I
feel
in
myself
a
strong
repugnance
to
fix
the
hour
which
will
uproot
my
sole
olive
branch,
and
transplant
it
far
from
me;
and,
when
I
speak
to
Frances
on
the
subject,
I
am
heard
with
a
kind
of
patient
pain,
as
though
I
alluded
to
some
fearful
operation,
at
which
her
nature
shudders,
but
from
which
her
fortitude
will
not
permit
her
to
recoil.
The
step
must,
however,
be
taken,
and
it
shall
be;
for,
though
Frances
will
not
make
a
milksop
of
her
son,
she
will
accustom
him
to
a
style
of
treatment,
a
forbearance,
a
congenial
tenderness,
he
will
meet
with
from
none
else.
She
sees,
as
I
also
see,
a
something
in
Victor's
temper
a
kind
of
electrical
ardour
and
power
which
emits,
now
and
then,
ominous
sparks;
Hunsden
calls
it
his
spirit,
and
says
it
should
not
be
curbed.
I
call
it
the
leaven
of
the
offending
Adam,
and
consider
that
it
should
be,
if
not
WHIPPED
out
of
him,
at
least
soundly
disciplined;
and
that
he
will
be
cheap
of
any
amount
of
either
bodily
or
mental
suffering
which
will
ground
him
radically
in
the
art
of
self
control.
Frances
gives
this
something
in
her
son's
marked
character
no
name;
but
when
it
appears
in
the
grinding
of
his
teeth,
in
the
glittering
of
his
eye,
in
the
fierce
revolt
of
feeling
against
disappointment,
mischance,
sudden
sorrow,
or
supposed
injustice,
she
folds
him
to
her
breast,
or
takes
him
to
walk
with
her
alone
in
the
wood;
then
she
reasons
with
him
like
any
philosopher,
and
to
reason
Victor
is
ever
accessible;
then
she
looks
at
him
with
eyes
of
love,
and
by
love
Victor
can
be
infallibly
subjugated;
but
will
reason
or
love
be
the
weapons
with
which
in
future
the
world
will
meet
his
violence?
Oh,
no!
for
that
flash
in
his
black
eye
for
that
cloud
on
his
bony
brow
for
that
compression
of
his
statuesque
lips,
the
lad
will
some
day
get
blows
instead
of
blandishments
kicks
instead
of
kisses;
then
for
the
fit
of
mute
fury
which
will
sicken
his
body
and
madden
his
soul;
then
for
the
ordeal
of
merited
and
salutary
suffering,
out
of
which
he
will
come
(I
trust)
a
wiser
and
a
better
man.
I
see
him
now;
he
stands
by
Hunsden,
who
is
seated
on
the
lawn
under
the
beech;
Hunsden's
hand
rests
on
the
boy's
collar,
and
he
is
instilling
God
knows
what
principles
into
his
ear.
Victor
looks
well
just
now,
for
he
listens
with
a
sort
of
smiling
interest;
he
never
looks
so
like
his
mother
as
when
he
smiles
pity
the
sunshine
breaks
out
so
rarely!
Victor
has
a
preference
for
Hunsden,
full
as
strong
as
I
deem
desirable,
being
considerably
more
potent,
decided,
and
indiscriminating,
than
any
I
ever
entertained
for
that
personage
myself.
Frances,
too,
regards
it
with
a
sort
of
unexpressed
anxiety;
while
her
son
leans
on
Hunsden's
knee,
or
rests
against
his
shoulder,
she
roves
with
restless
movement
round,
like
a
dove
guarding
its
young
from
a
hovering
hawk;
she
says
she
wishes
Hunsden
had
children
of
his
own,
for
then
he
would
better
know
the
danger
of
inciting
their
pride
end
indulging
their
foibles.
Frances
approaches
my
library
window;
puts
aside
the
honeysuckle
which
half
covers
it,
and
tells
me
tea
is
ready;
seeing
that
I
continue
busy
she
enters
the
room,
comes
near
me
quietly,
and
puts
her
hand
on
my
shoulder.
"Monsieur
est
trop
applique."
"I
shall
soon
have
done."
She
draws
a
chair
near,
and
sits
down
to
wait
till
I
have
finished;
her
presence
is
as
pleasant
to
my
mind
as
the
perfume
of
the
fresh
hay
and
spicy
flowers,
as
the
glow
of
the
westering
sun,
as
the
repose
of
the
midsummer
eve
are
to
my
senses.
But
Hunsden
comes;
I
hear
his
step,
and
there
he
is,
bending
through
the
lattice,
from
which
he
has
thrust
away
the
woodbine
with
unsparing
hand,
disturbing
two
bees
and
a
butterfly.
"Crimsworth!
I
say,
Crimsworth!
take
that
pen
out
of
his
hand,
mistress,
and
make
him
lift
up
his
head."
"Well,
Hunsden?
I
hear
you
"
"I
was
at
X
yesterday!
your
brother
Ned
is
getting
richer
than
Croesus
by
railway
speculations;
they
call
him
in
the
Piece
Hall
a
stag
of
ten;
and
I
have
heard
from
Brown.
M.
and
Madame
Vandenhuten
and
Jean
Baptiste
talk
of
coming
to
see
you
next
month.
He
mentions
the
Pelets
too;
he
says
their
domestic
harmony
is
not
the
finest
in
the
world,
but
in
business
they
are
doing
'on
ne
peut
mieux,'
which
circumstance
he
concludes
will
be
a
sufficient
consolation
to
both
for
any
little
crosses
in
the
affections.
Why
don't
you
invite
the
Pelets
to
shire,
Crimsworth?
I
should
so
like
to
see
your
first
flame,
Zoraide.
Mistress,
don't
be
jealous,
but
he
loved
that
lady
to
distraction;
I
know
it
for
a
fact.
Brown
says
she
weighs
twelve
stones
now;
you
see
what
you've
lost,
Mr.
Professor.
Now,
Monsieur
and
Madame,
if
you
don't
come
to
tea,
Victor
and
I
will
begin
without
you."
