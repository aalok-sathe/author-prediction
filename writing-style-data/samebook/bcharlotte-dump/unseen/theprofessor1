THE
other
day,
in
looking
over
my
papers,
I
found
in
my
desk
the
following
copy
of
a
letter,
sent
by
me
a
year
since
to
an
old
school
acquaintance:
"DEAR
CHARLES,
"I
think
when
you
and
I
were
at
Eton
together,
we
were
neither
of
us
what
could
be
called
popular
characters:
you
were
a
sarcastic,
observant,
shrewd,
cold
blooded
creature;
my
own
portrait
I
will
not
attempt
to
draw,
but
I
cannot
recollect
that
it
was
a
strikingly
attractive
one
can
you?
What
animal
magnetism
drew
thee
and
me
together
I
know
not;
certainly
I
never
experienced
anything
of
the
Pylades
and
Orestes
sentiment
for
you,
and
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
you,
on
your
part,
were
equally
free
from
all
romantic
regard
to
me.
Still,
out
of
school
hours
we
walked
and
talked
continually
together;
when
the
theme
of
conversation
was
our
companions
or
our
masters
we
understood
each
other,
and
when
I
recurred
to
some
sentiment
of
affection,
some
vague
love
of
an
excellent
or
beautiful
object,
whether
in
animate
or
inanimate
nature,
your
sardonic
coldness
did
not
move
me.
I
felt
myself
superior
to
that
check
THEN
as
I
do
NOW.
"It
is
a
long
time
since
I
wrote
to
you,
and
a
still
longer
time
since
I
saw
you.
Chancing
to
take
up
a
newspaper
of
your
county
the
other
day,
my
eye
fell
upon
your
name.
I
began
to
think
of
old
times;
to
run
over
the
events
which
have
transpired
since
we
separated;
and
I
sat
down
and
commenced
this
letter.
What
you
have
been
doing
I
know
not;
but
you
shall
hear,
if
you
choose
to
listen,
how
the
world
has
wagged
with
me.
"First,
after
leaving
Eton,
I
had
an
interview
with
my
maternal
uncles,
Lord
Tynedale
and
the
Hon.
John
Seacombe.
They
asked
me
if
I
would
enter
the
Church,
and
my
uncle
the
nobleman
offered
me
the
living
of
Seacombe,
which
is
in
his
gift,
if
I
would;
then
my
other
uncle,
Mr.
Seacombe,
hinted
that
when
I
became
rector
of
Seacombe
cum
Scaife,
I
might
perhaps
be
allowed
to
take,
as
mistress
of
my
house
and
head
of
my
parish,
one
of
my
six
cousins,
his
daughters,
all
of
whom
I
greatly
dislike.
"I
declined
both
the
Church
and
matrimony.
A
good
clergyman
is
a
good
thing,
but
I
should
have
made
a
very
bad
one.
As
to
the
wife
oh
how
like
a
night
mare
is
the
thought
of
being
bound
for
life
to
one
of
my
cousins!
No
doubt
they
are
accomplished
and
pretty;
but
not
an
accomplishment,
not
a
charm
of
theirs,
touches
a
chord
in
my
bosom.
To
think
of
passing
the
winter
evenings
by
the
parlour
fire
side
of
Seacombe
Rectory
alone
with
one
of
them
for
instance,
the
large
and
well
modelled
statue,
Sarah
no;
I
should
be
a
bad
husband,
under
such
circumstances,
as
well
as
a
bad
clergyman.
"When
I
had
declined
my
uncles'
offers
they
asked
me
'what
I
intended
to
do?'
I
said
I
should
reflect.
They
reminded
me
that
I
had
no
fortune,
and
no
expectation
of
any,
and,
after
a
considerable
pause,
Lord
Tynedale
demanded
sternly,
'Whether
I
had
thoughts
of
following
my
father's
steps
and
engaging
in
trade?'
Now,
I
had
had
no
thoughts
of
the
sort.
I
do
not
think
that
my
turn
of
mind
qualifies
me
to
make
a
good
tradesman;
my
taste,
my
ambition
does
not
lie
in
that
way;
but
such
was
the
scorn
expressed
in
Lord
Tynedale's
countenance
as
he
pronounced
the
word
TRADE
such
the
contemptuous
sarcasm
of
his
tone
that
I
was
instantly
decided.
My
father
was
but
a
name
to
me,
yet
that
name
I
did
not
like
to
hear
mentioned
with
a
sneer
to
my
very
face.
I
answered
then,
with
haste
and
warmth,
'I
cannot
do
better
than
follow
in
my
father's
steps;
yes,
I
will
be
a
tradesman.'
My
uncles
did
not
remonstrate;
they
and
I
parted
with
mutual
disgust.
In
reviewing
this
transaction,
I
find
that
I
was
quite
right
to
shake
off
the
burden
of
Tynedale's
patronage,
but
a
fool
to
offer
my
shoulders
instantly
for
the
reception
of
another
burden
one
which
might
be
more
intolerable,
and
which
certainly
was
yet
untried.
"I
wrote
instantly
to
Edward
you
know
Edward
my
only
brother,
ten
years
my
senior,
married
to
a
rich
mill
owner's
daughter,
and
now
possessor
of
the
mill
and
business
which
was
my
father's
before
he
failed.
You
are
aware
that
my
father
once
reckoned
a
Croesus
of
wealth
became
bankrupt
a
short
time
previous
to
his
death,
and
that
my
mother
lived
in
destitution
for
some
six
months
after
him,
unhelped
by
her
aristocratical
brothers,
whom
she
had
mortally
offended
by
her
union
with
Crimsworth,
the
shire
manufacturer.
At
the
end
of
the
six
months
she
brought
me
into
the
world,
and
then
herself
left
it
without,
I
should
think,
much
regret,
as
it
contained
little
hope
or
comfort
for
her.
"My
father's
relations
took
charge
of
Edward,
as
they
did
of
me,
till
I
was
nine
years
old.
At
that
period
it
chanced
that
the
representation
of
an
important
borough
in
our
county
fell
vacant;
Mr.
Seacombe
stood
for
it.
My
uncle
Crimsworth,
an
astute
mercantile
man,
took
the
opportunity
of
writing
a
fierce
letter
to
the
candidate,
stating
that
if
he
and
Lord
Tynedale
did
not
consent
to
do
something
towards
the
support
of
their
sister's
orphan
children,
he
would
expose
their
relentless
and
malignant
conduct
towards
that
sister,
and
do
his
best
to
turn
the
circumstances
against
Mr.
Seacombe's
election.
That
gentleman
and
Lord
T.
knew
well
enough
that
the
Crimsworths
were
an
unscrupulous
and
determined
race;
they
knew
also
that
they
had
influence
in
the
borough
of
X
;
and,
making
a
virtue
of
necessity,
they
consented
to
defray
the
expenses
of
my
education.
I
was
sent
to
Eton,
where
I
remained
ten
years,
during
which
space
of
time
Edward
and
I
never
met.
He,
when
he
grew
up,
entered
into
trade,
and
pursued
his
calling
with
such
diligence,
ability,
and
success,
that
now,
in
his
thirtieth
year,
he
was
fast
making
a
fortune.
Of
this
I
was
apprised
by
the
occasional
short
letters
I
received
from
him,
some
three
or
four
times
a
year;
which
said
letters
never
concluded
without
some
expression
of
determined
enmity
against
the
house
of
Seacombe,
and
some
reproach
to
me
for
living,
as
he
said,
on
the
bounty
of
that
house.
At
first,
while
still
in
boyhood,
I
could
not
understand
why,
as
I
had
no
parents,
I
should
not
be
indebted
to
my
uncles
Tynedale
and
Seacombe
for
my
education;
but
as
I
grew
up,
and
heard
by
degrees
of
the
persevering
hostility,
the
hatred
till
death
evinced
by
them
against
my
father
of
the
sufferings
of
my
mother
of
all
the
wrongs,
in
short,
of
our
house
then
did
I
conceive
shame
of
the
dependence
in
which
I
lived,
and
form
a
resolution
no
more
to
take
bread
from
hands
which
had
refused
to
minister
to
the
necessities
of
my
dying
mother.
It
was
by
these
feelings
I
was
influenced
when
I
refused
the
Rectory
of
Seacombe,
and
the
union
with
one
of
my
patrician
cousins.
"An
irreparable
breach
thus
being
effected
between
my
uncles
and
myself,
I
wrote
to
Edward;
told
him
what
had
occurred,
and
informed
him
of
my
intention
to
follow
his
steps
and
be
a
tradesman.
I
asked,
moreover,
if
he
could
give
me
employment.
His
answer
expressed
no
approbation
of
my
conduct,
but
he
said
I
might
come
down
to
shire,
if
I
liked,
and
he
would
'see
what
could
be
done
in
the
way
of
furnishing
me
with
work.'
I
repressed
all
even
mental
comment
on
his
note
packed
my
trunk
and
carpet
bag,
and
started
for
the
North
directly.
"After
two
days'
travelling
(railroads
were
not
then
in
existence)
I
arrived,
one
wet
October
afternoon,
in
the
town
of
X
.
I
had
always
understood
that
Edward
lived
in
this
town,
but
on
inquiry
I
found
that
it
was
only
Mr.
Crimsworth's
mill
and
warehouse
which
were
situated
in
the
smoky
atmosphere
of
Bigben
Close;
his
RESIDENCE
lay
four
miles
out,
in
the
country.
"It
was
late
in
the
evening
when
I
alighted
at
the
gates
of
the
habitation
designated
to
me
as
my
brother's.
As
I
advanced
up
the
avenue,
I
could
see
through
the
shades
of
twilight,
and
the
dark
gloomy
mists
which
deepened
those
shades,
that
the
house
was
large,
and
the
grounds
surrounding
it
sufficiently
spacious.
I
paused
a
moment
on
the
lawn
in
front,
and
leaning
my
back
against
a
tall
tree
which
rose
in
the
centre,
I
gazed
with
interest
on
the
exterior
of
Crimsworth
Hall.
"Edward
is
rich,"
thought
I
to
myself.
'I
believed
him
to
be
doing
well
but
I
did
not
know
he
was
master
of
a
mansion
like
this.'
Cutting
short
all
marvelling;
speculation,
conjecture,
&c.,
I
advanced
to
the
front
door
and
rang.
A
man
servant
opened
it
I
announced
myself
he
relieved
me
of
my
wet
cloak
and
carpet
bag,
and
ushered
me
into
a
room
furnished
as
a
library,
where
there
was
a
bright
fire
and
candles
burning
on
the
table;
he
informed
me
that
his
master
was
not
yet
returned
from
X
market,
but
that
he
would
certainly
be
at
home
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour.
"Being
left
to
myself,
I
took
the
stuffed
easy
chair,
covered
with
red
morocco,
which
stood
by
the
fireside,
and
while
my
eyes
watched
the
flames
dart
from
the
glowing
coals,
and
the
cinders
fall
at
intervals
on
the
hearth,
my
mind
busied
itself
in
conjectures
concerning
the
meeting
about
to
take
place.
Amidst
much
that
was
doubtful
in
the
subject
of
these
conjectures,
there
was
one
thing
tolerably
certain
I
was
in
no
danger
of
encountering
severe
disappointment;
from
this,
the
moderation
of
my
expectations
guaranteed
me.
I
anticipated
no
overflowings
of
fraternal
tenderness;
Edward's
letters
had
always
been
such
as
to
prevent
the
engendering
or
harbouring
of
delusions
of
this
sort.
Still,
as
I
sat
awaiting
his
arrival,
I
felt
eager
very
eager
I
cannot
tell
you
why;
my
hand,
so
utterly
a
stranger
to
the
grasp
of
a
kindred
hand,
clenched
itself
to
repress
the
tremor
with
which
impatience
would
fain
have
shaken
it.
"I
thought
of
my
uncles;
and
as
I
was
engaged
in
wondering
whether
Edward's
indifference
would
equal
the
cold
disdain
I
had
always
experienced
from
them,
I
heard
the
avenue
gates
open:
wheels
approached
the
house;
Mr.
Crimsworth
was
arrived;
and
after
the
lapse
of
some
minutes,
and
a
brief
dialogue
between
himself
and
his
servant
in
the
hall,
his
tread
drew
near
the
library
door
that
tread
alone
announced
the
master
of
the
house.
"I
still
retained
some
confused
recollection
of
Edward
as
he
was
ten
years
ago
a
tall,
wiry,
raw
youth;
NOW,
as
I
rose
from
my
seat
and
turned
towards
the
library
door,
I
saw
a
fine
looking
and
powerful
man,
light
complexioned,
well
made,
and
of
athletic
proportions;
the
first
glance
made
me
aware
of
an
air
of
promptitude
and
sharpness,
shown
as
well
in
his
movements
as
in
his
port,
his
eye,
and
the
general
expression
of
his
face.
He
greeted
me
with
brevity,
and,
in
the
moment
of
shaking
hands,
scanned
me
from
head
to
foot;
he
took
his
seat
in
the
morocco
covered
arm
chair,
and
motioned
me
to
another
seat.
"'I
expected
you
would
have
called
at
the
counting
house
in
the
Close,'
said
he;
and
his
voice,
I
noticed,
had
an
abrupt
accent,
probably
habitual
to
him;
he
spoke
also
with
a
guttural
northern
tone,
which
sounded
harsh
in
my
ears,
accustomed
to
the
silvery
utterance
of
the
South.
"'The
landlord
of
the
inn,
where
the
coach
stopped,
directed
me
here,'
said
I.
'I
doubted
at
first
the
accuracy
of
his
information,
not
being
aware
that
you
had
such
a
residence
as
this.'
"'Oh,
it
is
all
right!'
he
replied,
'only
I
was
kept
half
an
hour
behind
time,
waiting
for
you
that
is
all.
I
thought
you
must
be
coming
by
the
eight
o'clock
coach.'
"I
expressed
regret
that
he
had
had
to
wait;
he
made
no
answer,
but
stirred
the
fire,
as
if
to
cover
a
movement
of
impatience;
then
he
scanned
me
again.
"I
felt
an
inward
satisfaction
that
I
had
not,
in
the
first
moment
of
meeting,
betrayed
any
warmth,
any
enthusiasm;
that
I
had
saluted
this
man
with
a
quiet
and
steady
phlegm.
"'Have
you
quite
broken
with
Tynedale
and
Seacombe?'
he
asked
hastily.
"'I
do
not
think
I
shall
have
any
further
communication
with
them;
my
refusal
of
their
proposals
will,
I
fancy,
operate
as
a
barrier
against
all
future
intercourse.'
"'Why,'
said
he,
'I
may
as
well
remind
you
at
the
very
outset
of
our
connection,
that
"no
man
can
serve
two
masters."
Acquaintance
with
Lord
Tynedale
will
be
incompatible
with
assistance
from
me.'
There
was
a
kind
of
gratuitous
menace
in
his
eye
as
he
looked
at
me
in
finishing
this
observation.
"Feeling
no
disposition
to
reply
to
him,
I
contented
myself
with
an
inward
speculation
on
the
differences
which
exist
in
the
constitution
of
men's
minds.
I
do
not
know
what
inference
Mr.
Crimsworth
drew
from
my
silence
whether
he
considered
it
a
symptom
of
contumacity
or
an
evidence
of
my
being
cowed
by
his
peremptory
manner.
After
a
long
and
hard
stare
at
me,
he
rose
sharply
from
his
seat.
"'To
morrow,'
said
he,
'I
shall
call
your
attention
to
some
other
points;
but
now
it
is
supper
time,
and
Mrs.
Crimsworth
is
probably
waiting;
will
you
come?'
"He
strode
from
the
room,
and
I
followed.
In
crossing
the
hall,
I
wondered
what
Mrs.
Crimsworth
might
be.
'Is
she,'
thought
I,
'as
alien
to
what
I
like
as
Tynedale,
Seacombe,
the
Misses
Seacombe
as
the
affectionate
relative
now
striding
before
me?
or
is
she
better
than
these?
Shall
I,
in
conversing
with
her,
feel
free
to
show
something
of
my
real
nature;
or
'
Further
conjectures
were
arrested
by
my
entrance
into
the
dining
room.
"A
lamp,
burning
under
a
shade
of
ground
glass,
showed
a
handsome
apartment,
wainscoted
with
oak;
supper
was
laid
on
the
table;
by
the
fire
place,
standing
as
if
waiting
our
entrance,
appeared
a
lady;
she
was
young,
tall,
and
well
shaped;
her
dress
was
handsome
and
fashionable:
so
much
my
first
glance
sufficed
to
ascertain.
A
gay
salutation
passed
between
her
and
Mr.
Crimsworth;
she
chid
him,
half
playfully,
half
poutingly,
for
being
late;
her
voice
(I
always
take
voices
into
the
account
in
judging
of
character)
was
lively
it
indicated,
I
thought,
good
animal
spirits.
Mr.
Crimsworth
soon
checked
her
animated
scolding
with
a
kiss
a
kiss
that
still
told
of
the
bridegroom
(they
had
not
yet
been
married
a
year);
she
took
her
seat
at
the
supper
table
in
first
rate
spirits.
Perceiving
me,
she
begged
my
pardon
for
not
noticing
me
before,
and
then
shook
hands
with
me,
as
ladies
do
when
a
flow
of
good
humour
disposes
them
to
be
cheerful
to
all,
even
the
most
indifferent
of
their
acquaintance.
It
was
now
further
obvious
to
me
that
she
had
a
good
complexion,
and
features
sufficiently
marked
but
agreeable;
her
hair
was
red
quite
red.
She
and
Edward
talked
much,
always
in
a
vein
of
playful
contention;
she
was
vexed,
or
pretended
to
be
vexed,
that
he
had
that
day
driven
a
vicious
horse
in
the
gig,
and
he
made
light
of
her
fears.
Sometimes
she
appealed
to
me.
"'Now,
Mr.
William,
isn't
it
absurd
in
Edward
to
talk
so?
He
says
he
will
drive
Jack,
and
no
other
horse,
and
the
brute
has
thrown
him
twice
already.
"She
spoke
with
a
kind
of
lisp,
not
disagreeable,
but
childish.
I
soon
saw
also
that
there
was
more
than
girlish
a
somewhat
infantine
expression
in
her
by
no
means
small
features;
this
lisp
and
expression
were,
I
have
no
doubt,
a
charm
in
Edward's
eyes,
and
would
be
so
to
those
of
most
men,
but
they
were
not
to
mine.
I
sought
her
eye,
desirous
to
read
there
the
intelligence
which
I
could
not
discern
in
her
face
or
hear
in
her
conversation;
it
was
merry,
rather
small;
by
turns
I
saw
vivacity,
vanity,
coquetry,
look
out
through
its
irid,
but
I
watched
in
vain
for
a
glimpse
of
soul.
I
am
no
Oriental;
white
necks,
carmine
lips
and
cheeks,
clusters
of
bright
curls,
do
not
suffice
for
me
without
that
Promethean
spark
which
will
live
after
the
roses
and
lilies
are
faded,
the
burnished
hair
grown
grey.
In
sunshine,
in
prosperity,
the
flowers
are
very
well;
but
how
many
wet
days
are
there
in
life
November
seasons
of
disaster,
when
a
man's
hearth
and
home
would
be
cold
indeed,
without
the
clear,
cheering
gleam
of
intellect.
"Having
perused
the
fair
page
of
Mrs.
Crimsworth's
face,
a
deep,
involuntary
sigh
announced
my
disappointment;
she
took
it
as
a
homage
to
her
beauty,
and
Edward,
who
was
evidently
proud
of
his
rich
and
handsome
young
wife,
threw
on
me
a
glance
half
ridicule,
half
ire.
"I
turned
from
them
both,
and
gazing
wearily
round
the
room,
I
saw
two
pictures
set
in
the
oak
panelling
one
on
each
side
the
mantel
piece.
Ceasing
to
take
part
in
the
bantering
conversation
that
flowed
on
between
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Crimsworth,
I
bent
my
thoughts
to
the
examination
of
these
pictures.
They
were
portraits
a
lady
and
a
gentleman,
both
costumed
in
the
fashion
of
twenty
years
ago.
The
gentleman
was
in
the
shade.
I
could
not
see
him
well.
The
lady
had
the
benefit
of
a
full
beam
from
the
softly
shaded
lamp.
I
presently
recognised
her;
I
had
seen
this
picture
before
in
childhood;
it
was
my
mother;
that
and
the
companion
picture
being
the
only
heir
looms
saved
out
of
the
sale
of
my
father's
property.
"The
face,
I
remembered,
had
pleased
me
as
a
boy,
but
then
I
did
not
understand
it;
now
I
knew
how
rare
that
class
of
face
is
in
the
world,
and
I
appreciated
keenly
its
thoughtful,
yet
gentle
expression.
The
serious
grey
eye
possessed
for
me
a
strong
charm,
as
did
certain
lines
in
the
features
indicative
of
most
true
and
tender
feeling.
I
was
sorry
it
was
only
a
picture.
"I
soon
left
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Crimsworth
to
themselves;
a
servant
conducted
me
to
my
bed
room;
in
closing
my
chamber
door,
I
shut
out
all
intruders
you,
Charles,
as
well
as
the
rest.
"Good
bye
for
the
present,
"WILLIAM
CRIMSWORTH."
To
this
letter
I
never
got
an
answer;
before
my
old
friend
received
it,
he
had
accepted
a
Government
appointment
in
one
of
the
colonies,
and
was
already
on
his
way
to
the
scene
of
his
official
labours.
What
has
become
of
him
since,
I
know
not.
The
leisure
time
I
have
at
command,
and
which
I
intended
to
employ
for
his
private
benefit,
I
shall
now
dedicate
to
that
of
the
public
at
large.
My
narrative
is
not
exciting,
and
above
all,
not
marvellous;
but
it
may
interest
some
individuals,
who,
having
toiled
in
the
same
vocation
as
myself,
will
find
in
my
experience
frequent
reflections
of
their
own.
The
above
letter
will
serve
as
an
introduction.
I
now
proceed.
A
FINE
October
morning
succeeded
to
the
foggy
evening
that
had
witnessed
my
first
introduction
to
Crimsworth
Hall.
I
was
early
up
and
walking
in
the
large
park
like
meadow
surrounding
the
house.
The
autumn
sun,
rising
over
the
shire
hills,
disclosed
a
pleasant
country;
woods
brown
and
mellow
varied
the
fields
from
which
the
harvest
had
been
lately
carried;
a
river,
gliding
between
the
woods,
caught
on
its
surface
the
somewhat
cold
gleam
of
the
October
sun
and
sky;
at
frequent
intervals
along
the
banks
of
the
river,
tall,
cylindrical
chimneys,
almost
like
slender
round
towers,
indicated
the
factories
which
the
trees
half
concealed;
here
and
there
mansions,
similar
to
Crimsworth
Hall,
occupied
agreeable
sites
on
the
hill
side;
the
country
wore,
on
the
whole,
a
cheerful,
active,
fertile
look.
Steam,
trade,
machinery
had
long
banished
from
it
all
romance
and
seclusion.
At
a
distance
of
five
miles,
a
valley,
opening
between
the
low
hills,
held
in
its
cups
the
great
town
of
X
.
A
dense,
permanent
vapour
brooded
over
this
locality
there
lay
Edward's
"Concern."
I
forced
my
eye
to
scrutinize
this
prospect,
I
forced
my
mind
to
dwell
on
it
for
a
time,
and
when
I
found
that
it
communicated
no
pleasurable
emotion
to
my
heart
that
it
stirred
in
me
none
of
the
hopes
a
man
ought
to
feel,
when
he
sees
laid
before
him
the
scene
of
his
life's
career
I
said
to
myself,
"William,
you
are
a
rebel
against
circumstances;
you
are
a
fool,
and
know
not
what
you
want;
you
have
chosen
trade
and
you
shall
be
a
tradesman.
Look!"
I
continued
mentally
"Look
at
the
sooty
smoke
in
that
hollow,
and
know
that
there
is
your
post!
There
you
cannot
dream,
you
cannot
speculate
and
theorize
there
you
shall
out
and
work!"
Thus
self
schooled,
I
returned
to
the
house.
My
brother
was
in
the
breakfast
room.
I
met
him
collectedly
I
could
not
meet
him
cheerfully;
he
was
standing
on
the
rug,
his
back
to
the
fire
how
much
did
I
read
in
the
expression
of
his
eye
as
my
glance
encountered
his,
when
I
advanced
to
bid
him
good
morning;
how
much
that
was
contradictory
to
my
nature!
He
said
"Good
morning"
abruptly
and
nodded,
and
then
he
snatched,
rather
than
took,
a
newspaper
from
the
table,
and
began
to
read
it
with
the
air
of
a
master
who
seizes
a
pretext
to
escape
the
bore
of
conversing
with
an
underling.
It
was
well
I
had
taken
a
resolution
to
endure
for
a
time,
or
his
manner
would
have
gone
far
to
render
insupportable
the
disgust
I
had
just
been
endeavouring
to
subdue.
I
looked
at
him:
I
measured
his
robust
frame
and
powerful
proportions;
I
saw
my
own
reflection
in
the
mirror
over
the
mantel
piece;
I
amused
myself
with
comparing
the
two
pictures.
In
face
I
resembled
him,
though
I
was
not
so
handsome;
my
features
were
less
regular;
I
had
a
darker
eye,
and
a
broader
brow
in
form
I
was
greatly
inferior
thinner,
slighter,
not
so
tall.
As
an
animal,
Edward
excelled
me
far;
should
he
prove
as
paramount
in
mind
as
in
person
I
must
be
a
slave
for
I
must
expect
from
him
no
lion
like
generosity
to
one
weaker
than
himself;
his
cold,
avaricious
eye,
his
stern,
forbidding
manner
told
me
he
would
not
spare.
Had
I
then
force
of
mind
to
cope
with
him?
I
did
not
know;
I
had
never
been
tried.
Mrs.
Crimsworth's
entrance
diverted
my
thoughts
for
a
moment.
She
looked
well,
dressed
in
white,
her
face
and
her
attire
shining
in
morning
and
bridal
freshness.
I
addressed
her
with
the
degree
of
ease
her
last
night's
careless
gaiety
seemed
to
warrant,
but
she
replied
with
coolness
and
restraint:
her
husband
had
tutored
her;
she
was
not
to
be
too
familiar
with
his
clerk.
As
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
Mr.
Crimsworth
intimated
to
me
that
they
were
bringing
the
gig
round
to
the
door,
and
that
in
five
minutes
he
should
expect
me
to
be
ready
to
go
down
with
him
to
X
.
I
did
not
keep
him
waiting;
we
were
soon
dashing
at
a
rapid
rate
along
the
road.
The
horse
he
drove
was
the
same
vicious
animal
about
which
Mrs.
Crimsworth
had
expressed
her
fears
the
night
before.
Once
or
twice
Jack
seemed
disposed
to
turn
restive,
but
a
vigorous
and
determined
application
of
the
whip
from
the
ruthless
hand
of
his
master
soon
compelled
him
to
submission,
and
Edward's
dilated
nostril
expressed
his
triumph
in
the
result
of
the
contest;
he
scarcely
spoke
to
me
during
the
whole
of
the
brief
drive,
only
opening
his
lips
at
intervals
to
damn
his
horse.
X
was
all
stir
and
bustle
when
we
entered
it;
we
left
the
clean
streets
where
there
were
dwelling
houses
and
shops,
churches,
and
public
buildings;
we
left
all
these,
and
turned
down
to
a
region
of
mills
and
warehouses;
thence
we
passed
through
two
massive
gates
into
a
great
paved
yard,
and
we
were
in
Bigben
Close,
and
the
mill
was
before
us,
vomiting
soot
from
its
long
chimney,
and
quivering
through
its
thick
brick
walls
with
the
commotion
of
its
iron
bowels.
Workpeople
were
passing
to
and
fro;
a
waggon
was
being
laden
with
pieces.
Mr.
Crimsworth
looked
from
side
to
side,
and
seemed
at
one
glance
to
comprehend
all
that
was
going
on;
he
alighted,
and
leaving
his
horse
and
gig
to
the
care
of
a
man
who
hastened
to
take
the
reins
from
his
hand,
he
bid
me
follow
him
to
the
counting
house.
We
entered
it;
a
very
different
place
from
the
parlours
of
Crimsworth
Hall
a
place
for
business,
with
a
bare,
planked
floor,
a
safe,
two
high
desks
and
stools,
and
some
chairs.
A
person
was
seated
at
one
of
the
desks,
who
took
off
his
square
cap
when
Mr.
Crimsworth
entered,
and
in
an
instant
was
again
absorbed
in
his
occupation
of
writing
or
calculating
I
know
not
which.
Mr.
Crimsworth,
having
removed
his
mackintosh,
sat
down
by
the
fire.
I
remained
standing
near
the
hearth;
he
said
presently
"Steighton,
you
may
leave
the
room;
I
have
some
business
to
transact
with
this
gentleman.
Come
back
when
you
hear
the
bell."
The
individual
at
the
desk
rose
and
departed,
closing
the
door
as
he
went
out.
Mr.
Crimsworth
stirred
the
fire,
then
folded
his
arms,
and
sat
a
moment
thinking,
his
lips
compressed,
his
brow
knit.
I
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
watch
him
how
well
his
features
were
cut!
what
a
handsome
man
he
was!
Whence,
then,
came
that
air
of
contraction
that
narrow
and
hard
aspect
on
his
forehead,
in
all
his
lineaments?
Turning
to
me
he
began
abruptly:
"You
are
come
down
to
shire
to
learn
to
be
a
tradesman?"
"Yes,
I
am."
"Have
you
made
up
your
mind
on
the
point?
Let
me
know
that
at
once."
"Yes."
"Well,
I
am
not
bound
to
help
you,
but
I
have
a
place
here
vacant,
if
you
are
qualified
for
it.
I
will
take
you
on
trial.
What
can
you
do?
Do
you
know
anything
besides
that
useless
trash
of
college
learning
Greek,
Latin,
and
so
forth?"
"I
have
studied
mathematics."
"Stuff!
I
dare
say
you
have."
"I
can
read
and
write
French
and
German."
"Hum!"
He
reflected
a
moment,
then
opening
a
drawer
in
a
desk
near
him
took
out
a
letter,
and
gave
it
to
me.
"Can
you
read
that?"
he
asked.
It
was
a
German
commercial
letter;
I
translated
it;
I
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
gratified
or
not
his
countenance
remained
fixed.
"It
is
well,"
he
said,
after
a
pause,
"that
you
are
acquainted
with
something
useful,
something
that
may
enable
you
to
earn
your
board
and
lodging:
since
you
know
French
and
German,
I
will
take
you
as
second
clerk
to
manage
the
foreign
correspondence
of
the
house.
I
shall
give
you
a
good
salary
90l.
a
year
and
now,"
he
continued,
raising
his
voice,
"hear
once
for
all
what
I
have
to
say
about
our
relationship,
and
all
that
sort
of
humbug!
I
must
have
no
nonsense
on
that
point;
it
would
never
suit
me.
I
shall
excuse
you
nothing
on
the
plea
of
being
my
brother;
if
I
find
you
stupid,
negligent,
dissipated,
idle,
or
possessed
of
any
faults
detrimental
to
the
interests
of
the
house,
I
shall
dismiss
you
as
I
would
any
other
clerk.
Ninety
pounds
a
year
are
good
wages,
and
I
expect
to
have
the
full
value
of
my
money
out
of
you;
remember,
too,
that
things
are
on
a
practical
footing
in
my
establishment
business
like
habits,
feelings,
and
ideas,
suit
me
best.
Do
you
understand?"
"Partly,"
I
replied.
"I
suppose
you
mean
that
I
am
to
do
my
work
for
my
wages;
not
to
expect
favour
from
you,
and
not
to
depend
on
you
for
any
help
but
what
I
earn;
that
suits
me
exactly,
and
on
these
terms
I
will
consent
to
be
your
clerk."
I
turned
on
my
heel,
and
walked
to
the
window;
this
time
I
did
not
consult
his
face
to
learn
his
opinion:
what
it
was
I
do
not
know,
nor
did
I
then
care.
After
a
silence
of
some
minutes
he
recommenced:
"You
perhaps
expect
to
be
accommodated
with
apartments
at
Crimsworth
Hall,
and
to
go
and
come
with
me
in
the
gig.
I
wish
you,
however,
to
be
aware
that
such
an
arrangement
would
be
quite
inconvenient
to
me.
I
like
to
have
the
seat
in
my
gig
at
liberty
for
any
gentleman
whom
for
business
reasons
I
may
wish
to
take
down
to
the
hall
for
a
night
or
so.
You
will
seek
out
lodgings
in
X
."
Quitting
the
window,
I
walked
back
to
the
hearth.
"Of
course
I
shall
seek
out
lodgings
in
X
,"
I
answered.
"It
would
not
suit
me
either
to
lodge
at
Crimsworth
Hall."
My
tone
was
quiet.
I
always
speak
quietly.
Yet
Mr.
Crimsworth's
blue
eye
became
incensed;
he
took
his
revenge
rather
oddly.
Turning
to
me
he
said
bluntly
"You
are
poor
enough,
I
suppose;
how
do
you
expect
to
live
till
your
quarter's
salary
becomes
due?"
"I
shall
get
on,"
said
I.
"How
do
you
expect
to
live?"
he
repeated
in
a
louder
voice.
"As
I
can,
Mr.
Crimsworth."
"Get
into
debt
at
your
peril!
that's
all,"
he
answered.
"For
aught
I
know
you
may
have
extravagant
aristocratic
habits:
if
you
have,
drop
them;
I
tolerate
nothing
of
the
sort
here,
and
I
will
never
give
you
a
shilling
extra,
whatever
liabilities
you
may
incur
mind
that."
"Yes,
Mr.
Crimsworth,
you
will
find
I
have
a
good
memory."
I
said
no
more.
I
did
not
think
the
time
was
come
for
much
parley.
I
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
it
would
be
folly
to
let
one's
temper
effervesce
often
with
such
a
man
as
Edward.
I
said
to
myself,
"I
will
place
my
cup
under
this
continual
dropping;
it
shall
stand
there
still
and
steady;
when
full,
it
will
run
over
of
itself
meantime
patience.
Two
things
are
certain.
I
am
capable
of
performing
the
work
Mr.
Crimsworth
has
set
me;
I
can
earn
my
wages
conscientiously,
and
those
wages
are
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
live.
As
to
the
fact
of
my
brother
assuming
towards
me
the
bearing
of
a
proud,
harsh
master,
the
fault
is
his,
not
mine;
and
shall
his
injustice,
his
bad
feeling,
turn
me
at
once
aside
from
the
path
I
have
chosen?
No;
at
least,
ere
I
deviate,
I
will
advance
far
enough
to
see
whither
my
career
tends.
As
yet
I
am
only
pressing
in
at
the
entrance
a
strait
gate
enough;
it
ought
to
have
a
good
terminus."
While
I
thus
reasoned,
Mr.
Crimsworth
rang
a
bell;
his
first
clerk,
the
individual
dismissed
previously
to
our
conference,
re
entered.
"Mr.
Steighton,"
said
he,
"show
Mr.
William
the
letters
from
Voss,
Brothers,
and
give
him
English
copies
of
the
answers;
he
will
translate
them."
Mr.
Steighton,
a
man
of
about
thirty
five,
with
a
face
at
once
sly
and
heavy,
hastened
to
execute
this
order;
he
laid
the
letters
on
the
desk,
and
I
was
soon
seated
at
it,
and
engaged
in
rendering
the
English
answers
into
German.
A
sentiment
of
keen
pleasure
accompanied
this
first
effort
to
earn
my
own
living
a
sentiment
neither
poisoned
nor
weakened
by
the
presence
of
the
taskmaster,
who
stood
and
watched
me
for
some
time
as
I
wrote.
I
thought
he
was
trying
to
read
my
character,
but
I
felt
as
secure
against
his
scrutiny
as
if
I
had
had
on
a
casque
with
the
visor
down
or
rather
I
showed
him
my
countenance
with
the
confidence
that
one
would
show
an
unlearned
man
a
letter
written
in
Greek;
he
might
see
lines,
and
trace
characters,
but
he
could
make
nothing
of
them;
my
nature
was
not
his
nature,
and
its
signs
were
to
him
like
the
words
of
an
unknown
tongue.
Ere
long
he
turned
away
abruptly,
as
if
baffled,
and
left
the
counting
house;
he
returned
to
it
but
twice
in
the
course
of
that
day;
each
time
he
mixed
and
swallowed
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water,
the
materials
for
making
which
he
extracted
from
a
cupboard
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace;
having
glanced
at
my
translations
he
could
read
both
French
and
German
he
went
out
again
in
silence.
I
SERVED
Edward
as
his
second
clerk
faithfully,
punctually,
diligently.
What
was
given
me
to
do
I
had
the
power
and
the
determination
to
do
well.
Mr.
Crimsworth
watched
sharply
for
defects,
but
found
none;
he
set
Timothy
Steighton,
his
favourite
and
head
man,
to
watch
also.
Tim
was
baffled;
I
was
as
exact
as
himself,
and
quicker.
Mr.
Crimsworth
made
inquiries
as
to
how
I
lived,
whether
I
got
into
debt
no,
my
accounts
with
my
landlady
were
always
straight.
I
had
hired
small
lodgings,
which
I
contrived
to
pay
for
out
of
a
slender
fund
the
accumulated
savings
of
my
Eton
pocket
money;
for
as
it
had
ever
been
abhorrent
to
my
nature
to
ask
pecuniary
assistance,
I
had
early
acquired
habits
of
self
denying
economy;
husbanding
my
monthly
allowance
with
anxious
care,
in
order
to
obviate
the
danger
of
being
forced,
in
some
moment
of
future
exigency,
to
beg
additional
aid.
I
remember
many
called
me
miser
at
the
time,
and
I
used
to
couple
the
reproach
with
this
consolation
better
to
be
misunderstood
now
than
repulsed
hereafter.
At
this
day
I
had
my
reward;
I
had
had
it
before,
when
on
parting
with
my
irritated
uncles
one
of
them
threw
down
on
the
table
before
me
a
5l.
note,
which
I
was
able
to
leave
there,
saying
that
my
travelling
expenses
were
already
provided
for.
Mr.
Crimsworth
employed
Tim
to
find
out
whether
my
landlady
had
any
complaint
to
make
on
the
score
of
my
morals;
she
answered
that
she
believed
I
was
a
very
religious
man,
and
asked
Tim,
in
her
turn,
if
he
thought
I
had
any
intention
of
going
into
the
Church
some
day;
for,
she
said,
she
had
had
young
curates
to
lodge
in
her
house
who
were
nothing
equal
to
me
for
steadiness
and
quietness.
Tim
was
"a
religious
man"
himself;
indeed,
he
was
"a
joined
Methodist,"
which
did
not
(be
it
understood)
prevent
him
from
being
at
the
same
time
an
engrained
rascal,
and
he
came
away
much
posed
at
hearing
this
account
of
my
piety.
Having
imparted
it
to
Mr.
Crimsworth,
that
gentleman,
who
himself
frequented
no
place
of
worship,
and
owned
no
God
but
Mammon,
turned
the
information
into
a
weapon
of
attack
against
the
equability
of
my
temper.
He
commenced
a
series
of
covert
sneers,
of
which
I
did
not
at
first
perceive
the
drift,
till
my
landlady
happened
to
relate
the
conversation
she
had
had
with
Mr.
Steighton;
this
enlightened
me;
afterwards
I
came
to
the
counting
house
prepared,
and
managed
to
receive
the
millowner's
blasphemous
sarcasms,
when
next
levelled
at
me,
on
a
buckler
of
impenetrable
indifference.
Ere
long
he
tired
of
wasting
his
ammunition
on
a
statue,
but
he
did
not
throw
away
the
shafts
he
only
kept
them
quiet
in
his
quiver.
Once
during
my
clerkship
I
had
an
invitation
to
Crimsworth
Hall;
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
a
large
party
given
in
honour
of
the
master's
birthday;
he
had
always
been
accustomed
to
invite
his
clerks
on
similar
anniversaries,
and
could
not
well
pass
me
over;
I
was,
however,
kept
strictly
in
the
background.
Mrs.
Crimsworth,
elegantly
dressed
in
satin
and
lace,
blooming
in
youth
and
health,
vouchsafed
me
no
more
notice
than
was
expressed
by
a
distant
move;
Crimsworth,
of
course,
never
spoke
to
me;
I
was
introduced
to
none
of
the
band
of
young
ladies,
who,
enveloped
in
silvery
clouds
of
white
gauze
and
muslin,
sat
in
array
against
me
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
long
and
large
room;
in
fact,
I
was
fairly
isolated,
and
could
but
contemplate
the
shining
ones
from
afar,
and
when
weary
of
such
a
dazzling
scene,
turn
for
a
change
to
the
consideration
of
the
carpet
pattern.
Mr.
Crimsworth,
standing
on
the
rug,
his
elbow
supported
by
the
marble
mantelpiece,
and
about
him
a
group
of
very
pretty
girls,
with
whom
he
conversed
gaily
Mr.
Crimsworth,
thus
placed,
glanced
at
me;
I
looked
weary,
solitary,
kept
down
like
some
desolate
tutor
or
governess;
he
was
satisfied.
Dancing
began;
I
should
have
liked
well
enough
to
be
introduced
to
some
pleasing
and
intelligent
girl,
and
to
have
freedom
and
opportunity
to
show
that
I
could
both
feel
and
communicate
the
pleasure
of
social
intercourse
that
I
was
not,
in
short,
a
block,
or
a
piece
of
furniture,
but
an
acting,
thinking,
sentient
man.
Many
smiling
faces
and
graceful
figures
glided
past
me,
but
the
smiles
were
lavished
on
other
eyes,
the
figures
sustained
by
other
hands
than
mine.
I
turned
away
tantalized,
left
the
dancers,
and
wandered
into
the
oak
panelled
dining
room.
No
fibre
of
sympathy
united
me
to
any
living
thing
in
this
house;
I
looked
for
and
found
my
mother's
picture.
I
took
a
wax
taper
from
a
stand,
and
held
it
up.
I
gazed
long,
earnestly;
my
heart
grew
to
the
image.
My
mother,
I
perceived,
had
bequeathed
to
me
much
of
her
features
and
countenance
her
forehead,
her
eyes,
her
complexion.
No
regular
beauty
pleases
egotistical
human
beings
so
much
as
a
softened
and
refined
likeness
of
themselves;
for
this
reason,
fathers
regard
with
complacency
the
lineaments
of
their
daughters'
faces,
where
frequently
their
own
similitude
is
found
flatteringly
associated
with
softness
of
hue
and
delicacy
of
outline.
I
was
just
wondering
how
that
picture,
to
me
so
interesting,
would
strike
an
impartial
spectator,
when
a
voice
close
behind
me
pronounced
the
words
"Humph!
there's
some
sense
in
that
face."
I
turned;
at
my
elbow
stood
a
tall
man,
young,
though
probably
five
or
six
years
older
than
I
in
other
respects
of
an
appearance
the
opposite
to
common
place;
though
just
now,
as
I
am
not
disposed
to
paint
his
portrait
in
detail,
the
reader
must
be
content
with
the
silhouette
I
have
just
thrown
off;
it
was
all
I
myself
saw
of
him
for
the
moment:
I
did
not
investigate
the
colour
of
his
eyebrows,
nor
of
his
eyes
either;
I
saw
his
stature,
and
the
outline
of
his
shape;
I
saw,
too,
his
fastidious
looking
RETROUSSE
nose;
these
observations,
few
in
number,
and
general
in
character
(the
last
excepted),
sufficed,
for
they
enabled
me
to
recognize
him.
"Good
evening,
Mr.
Hunsden,"
muttered
I
with
a
bow,
and
then,
like
a
shy
noodle
as
I
was,
I
began
moving
away
and
why?
Simply
because
Mr.
Hunsden
was
a
manufacturer
and
a
millowner,
and
I
was
only
a
clerk,
and
my
instinct
propelled
me
from
my
superior.
I
had
frequently
seen
Hunsden
in
Bigben
Close,
where
he
came
almost
weekly
to
transact
business
with
Mr.
Crimsworth,
but
I
had
never
spoken
to
him,
nor
he
to
me,
and
I
owed
him
a
sort
of
involuntary
grudge,
because
he
had
more
than
once
been
the
tacit
witness
of
insults
offered
by
Edward
to
me.
I
had
the
conviction
that
he
could
only
regard
me
as
a
poor
spirited
slave,
wherefore
I
now
went
about
to
shun
his
presence
and
eschew
his
conversation.
"Where
are
you
going?"
asked
he,
as
I
edged
off
sideways.
I
had
already
noticed
that
Mr.
Hunsden
indulged
in
abrupt
forms
of
speech,
and
I
perversely
said
to
myself
"He
thinks
he
may
speak
as
he
likes
to
a
poor
clerk;
but
my
mood
is
not,
perhaps,
so
supple
as
he
deems
it,
and
his
rough
freedom
pleases
me
not
at
all."
I
made
some
slight
reply,
rather
indifferent
than
courteous,
and
continued
to
move
away.
He
coolly
planted
himself
in
my
path.
"Stay
here
awhile,"
said
he:
"it
is
so
hot
in
the
dancing
room;
besides,
you
don't
dance;
you
have
not
had
a
partner
to
night."
He
was
right,
and
as
he
spoke
neither
his
look,
tone,
nor
manner
displeased
me;
my
AMOUR
PROPRE
was
propitiated;
he
had
not
addressed
me
out
of
condescension,
but
because,
having
repaired
to
the
cool
dining
room
for
refreshment,
he
now
wanted
some
one
to
talk
to,
by
way
of
temporary
amusement.
I
hate
to
be
condescended
to,
but
I
like
well
enough
to
oblige;
I
stayed.
"That
is
a
good
picture,"
he
continued,
recurring
to
the
portrait.
"Do
you
consider
the
face
pretty?"
I
asked.
"Pretty!
no
how
can
it
be
pretty,
with
sunk
eyes
and
hollow
cheeks?
but
it
is
peculiar;
it
seems
to
think.
You
could
have
a
talk
with
that
woman,
if
she
were
alive,
on
other
subjects
than
dress,
visiting,
and
compliments."
I
agreed
with
him,
but
did
not
say
so.
He
went
on.
"Not
that
I
admire
a
head
of
that
sort;
it
wants
character
and
force;
there's
too
much
of
the
sen
si
tive
(so
he
articulated
it,
curling
his
lip
at
the
same
time)
in
that
mouth;
besides,
there
is
Aristocrat
written
on
the
brow
and
defined
in
the
figure;
I
hate
your
aristocrats."
"You
think,
then,
Mr.
Hunsden,
that
patrician
descent
may
be
read
in
a
distinctive
cast
of
form
and
features?"
"Patrician
descent
be
hanged!
Who
doubts
that
your
lordlings
may
have
their
'distinctive
cast
of
form
and
features'
as
much
as
we
shire
tradesmen
have
ours?
But
which
is
the
best?
Not
theirs
assuredly.
As
to
their
women,
it
is
a
little
different:
they
cultivate
beauty
from
childhood
upwards,
and
may
by
care
and
training
attain
to
a
certain
degree
of
excellence
in
that
point,
just
like
the
oriental
odalisques.
Yet
even
this
superiority
is
doubtful.
Compare
the
figure
in
that
frame
with
Mrs.
Edward
Crimsworth
which
is
the
finer
animal?"
I
replied
quietly:
"Compare
yourself
and
Mr.
Edward
Crimsworth,
Mr
Hunsden."
"Oh,
Crimsworth
is
better
filled
up
than
I
am,
I
know
besides
he
has
a
straight
nose,
arched
eyebrows,
and
all
that;
but
these
advantages
if
they
are
advantages
he
did
not
inherit
from
his
mother,
the
patrician,
but
from
his
father,
old
Crimsworth,
who,
MY
father
says,
was
as
veritable
a
shire
blue
dyer
as
ever
put
indigo
in
a
vat
yet
withal
the
handsomest
man
in
the
three
Ridings.
It
is
you,
William,
who
are
the
aristocrat
of
your
family,
and
you
are
not
as
fine
a
fellow
as
your
plebeian
brother
by
long
chalk."
There
was
something
in
Mr.
Hunsden's
point
blank
mode
of
speech
which
rather
pleased
me
than
otherwise
because
it
set
me
at
my
ease.
I
continued
the
conversation
with
a
degree
of
interest.
"How
do
you
happen
to
know
that
I
am
Mr.
Crimsworth's
brother?
I
thought
you
and
everybody
else
looked
upon
me
only
in
the
light
of
a
poor
clerk."
"Well,
and
so
we
do;
and
what
are
you
but
a
poor
clerk?
You
do
Crimsworth's
work,
and
he
gives
you
wages
shabby
wages
they
are,
too."
I
was
silent.
Hunsden's
language
now
bordered
on
the
impertinent,
still
his
manner
did
not
offend
me
in
the
least
it
only
piqued
my
curiosity;
I
wanted
him
to
go
on,
which
he
did
in
a
little
while.
"This
world
is
an
absurd
one,"
said
he.
"Why
so,
Mr.
Hunsden?"
"I
wonder
you
should
ask:
you
are
yourself
a
strong
proof
of
the
absurdity
I
allude
to."
I
was
determined
he
should
explain
himself
of
his
own
accord,
without
my
pressing
him
so
to
do
so
I
resumed
my
silence.
"Is
it
your
intention
to
become
a
tradesman?"
he
inquired
presently.
"It
was
my
serious
intention
three
months
ago."
"Humph!
the
more
fool
you
you
look
like
a
tradesman!
What
a
practical
business
like
face
you
have!"
"My
face
is
as
the
Lord
made
it,
Mr.
Hunsden."
"The
Lord
never
made
either
your
face
or
head
for
X
What
good
can
your
bumps
of
ideality,
comparison,
self
esteem,
conscientiousness,
do
you
here?
But
if
you
like
Bigben
Close,
stay
there;
it's
your
own
affair,
not
mine."
"Perhaps
I
have
no
choice."
"Well,
I
care
nought
about
it
it
will
make
little
difference
to
me
what
you
do
or
where
you
go;
but
I'm
cool
now
I
want
to
dance
again;
and
I
see
such
a
fine
girl
sitting
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
there
by
her
mamma;
see
if
I
don't
get
her
for
a
partner
in
a
jiffy!
There's
Waddy
Sam
Waddy
making
up
to
her;
won't
I
cut
him
out?"
And
Mr.
Hunsden
strode
away.
I
watched
him
through
the
open
folding
doors;
he
outstripped
Waddy,
applied
for
the
hand
of
the
fine
girl,
and
led
her
off
triumphant.
She
was
a
tall,
well
made,
full
formed,
dashingly
dressed
young
woman,
much
in
the
style
of
Mrs.
E.
Crimsworth;
Hunsden
whirled
her
through
the
waltz
with
spirit;
he
kept
at
her
side
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening,
and
I
read
in
her
animated
and
gratified
countenance
that
he
succeeded
in
making
himself
perfectly
agreeable.
The
mamma
too
(a
stout
person
in
a
turban
Mrs.
Lupton
by
name)
looked
well
pleased;
prophetic
visions
probably
flattered
her
inward
eye.
The
Hunsdens
were
of
an
old
stem;
and
scornful
as
Yorke
(such
was
my
late
interlocutor's
name)
professed
to
be
of
the
advantages
of
birth,
in
his
secret
heart
he
well
knew
and
fully
appreciated
the
distinction
his
ancient,
if
not
high
lineage
conferred
on
him
in
a
mushroom
place
like
X
,
concerning
whose
inhabitants
it
was
proverbially
said,
that
not
one
in
a
thousand
knew
his
own
grandfather.
Moreover
the
Hunsdens,
once
rich,
were
still
independent;
and
report
affirmed
that
Yorke
bade
fair,
by
his
success
in
business,
to
restore
to
pristine
prosperity
the
partially
decayed
fortunes
of
his
house.
These
circumstances
considered,
Mrs.
Lupton's
broad
face
might
well
wear
a
smile
of
complacency
as
she
contemplated
the
heir
of
Hunsden
Wood
occupied
in
paying
assiduous
court
to
her
darling
Sarah
Martha.
I,
however,
whose
observations
being
less
anxious,
were
likely
to
be
more
accurate,
soon
saw
that
the
grounds
for
maternal
self
congratulation
were
slight
indeed;
the
gentleman
appeared
to
me
much
more
desirous
of
making,
than
susceptible
of
receiving
an
impression.
I
know
not
what
it
was
in
Mr.
Hunsden
that,
as
I
watched
him
(I
had
nothing
better
to
do),
suggested
to
me,
every
now
and
then,
the
idea
of
a
foreigner.
In
form
and
features
he
might
be
pronounced
English,
though
even
there
one
caught
a
dash
of
something
Gallic;
but
he
had
no
English
shyness:
he
had
learnt
somewhere,
somehow,
the
art
of
setting
himself
quite
at
his
ease,
and
of
allowing
no
insular
timidity
to
intervene
as
a
barrier
between
him
and
his
convenience
or
pleasure.
Refinement
he
did
not
affect,
yet
vulgar
he
could
not
be
called;
he
was
not
odd
no
quiz
yet
he
resembled
no
one
else
I
had
ever
seen
before;
his
general
bearing
intimated
complete,
sovereign
satisfaction
with
himself;
yet,
at
times,
an
indescribable
shade
passed
like
an
eclipse
over
his
countenance,
and
seemed
to
me
like
the
sign
of
a
sudden
and
strong
inward
doubt
of
himself,
his
words
and
actions
an
energetic
discontent
at
his
life
or
his
social
position,
his
future
prospects
or
his
mental
attainments
I
know
not
which;
perhaps
after
all
it
might
only
be
a
bilious
caprice.
No
man
likes
to
acknowledge
that
he
has
made
a
mistake
in
the
choice
of
his
profession,
and
every
man,
worthy
of
the
name,
will
row
long
against
wind
and
tide
before
he
allows
himself
to
cry
out,
"I
am
baffled!"
and
submits
to
be
floated
passively
back
to
land.
From
the
first
week
of
my
residence
in
X
I
felt
my
occupation
irksome.
The
thing
itself
the
work
of
copying
and
translating
business
letters
was
a
dry
and
tedious
task
enough,
but
had
that
been
all,
I
should
long
have
borne
with
the
nuisance;
I
am
not
of
an
impatient
nature,
and
influenced
by
the
double
desire
of
getting
my
living
and
justifying
to
myself
and
others
the
resolution
I
had
taken
to
become
a
tradesman,
I
should
have
endured
in
silence
the
rust
and
cramp
of
my
best
faculties;
I
should
not
have
whispered,
even
inwardly,
that
I
longed
for
liberty;
I
should
have
pent
in
every
sigh
by
which
my
heart
might
have
ventured
to
intimate
its
distress
under
the
closeness,
smoke,
monotony
and
joyless
tumult
of
Bigben
Close,
and
its
panting
desire
for
freer
and
fresher
scenes;
I
should
have
set
up
the
image
of
Duty,
the
fetish
of
Perseverance,
in
my
small
bedroom
at
Mrs.
King's
lodgings,
and
they
two
should
have
been
my
household
gods,
from
which
my
darling,
my
cherished
in
secret,
Imagination,
the
tender
and
the
mighty,
should
never,
either
by
softness
or
strength,
have
severed
me.
But
this
was
not
all;
the
antipathy
which
had
sprung
up
between
myself
and
my
employer
striking
deeper
root
and
spreading
denser
shade
daily,
excluded
me
from
every
glimpse
of
the
sunshine
of
life;
and
I
began
to
feel
like
a
plant
growing
in
humid
darkness
out
of
the
slimy
walls
of
a
well.
Antipathy
is
the
only
word
which
can
express
the
feeling
Edward
Crimsworth
had
for
me
a
feeling,
in
a
great
measure,
involuntary,
and
which
was
liable
to
be
excited
by
every,
the
most
trifling
movement,
look,
or
word
of
mine.
My
southern
accent
annoyed
him;
the
degree
of
education
evinced
in
my
language
irritated
him;
my
punctuality,
industry,
and
accuracy,
fixed
his
dislike,
and
gave
it
the
high
flavour
and
poignant
relish
of
envy;
he
feared
that
I
too
should
one
day
make
a
successful
tradesman.
Had
I
been
in
anything
inferior
to
him,
he
would
not
have
hated
me
so
thoroughly,
but
I
knew
all
that
he
knew,
and,
what
was
worse,
he
suspected
that
I
kept
the
padlock
of
silence
on
mental
wealth
in
which
he
was
no
sharer.
If
he
could
have
once
placed
me
in
a
ridiculous
or
mortifying
position,
he
would
have
forgiven
me
much,
but
I
was
guarded
by
three
faculties
Caution,
Tact,
Observation;
and
prowling
and
prying
as
was
Edward's
malignity,
it
could
never
baffle
the
lynx
eyes
of
these,
my
natural
sentinels.
Day
by
day
did
his
malice
watch
my
tact,
hoping
it
would
sleep,
and
prepared
to
steal
snake
like
on
its
slumber;
but
tact,
if
it
be
genuine,
never
sleeps.
I
had
received
my
first
quarter's
wages,
and
was
returning
to
my
lodgings,
possessed
heart
and
soul
with
the
pleasant
feeling
that
the
master
who
had
paid
me
grudged
every
penny
of
that
hard
earned
pittance
(I
had
long
ceased
to
regard
Mr.
Crimsworth
as
my
brother
he
was
a
hard,
grinding
master;
he
wished
to
be
an
inexorable
tyrant:
that
was
all).
Thoughts,
not
varied
but
strong,
occupied
my
mind;
two
voices
spoke
within
me;
again
and
again
they
uttered
the
same
monotonous
phrases.
One
said:
"William,
your
life
is
intolerable."
The
other:
"What
can
you
do
to
alter
it?"
I
walked
fast,
for
it
was
a
cold,
frosty
night
in
January;
as
I
approached
my
lodgings,
I
turned
from
a
general
view
of
my
affairs
to
the
particular
speculation
as
to
whether
my
fire
would
be
out;
looking
towards
the
window
of
my
sitting
room,
I
saw
no
cheering
red
gleam.
"That
slut
of
a
servant
has
neglected
it
as
usual,"
said
I,
"and
I
shall
see
nothing
but
pale
ashes
if
I
go
in;
it
is
a
fine
starlight
night
I
will
walk
a
little
farther."
It
WAS
a
fine
night,
and
the
streets
were
dry
and
even
clean
for
X
;
there
was
a
crescent
curve
of
moonlight
to
be
seen
by
the
parish
church
tower,
and
hundreds
of
stars
shone
keenly
bright
in
all
quarters
of
the
sky.
Unconsciously
I
steered
my
course
towards
the
country;
I
had
got
into
Grove
street,
and
began
to
feel
the
pleasure
of
seeing
dim
trees
at
the
extremity,
round
a
suburban
house,
when
a
person
leaning
over
the
iron
gate
of
one
of
the
small
gardens
which
front
the
neat
dwelling
houses
in
this
street,
addressed
me
as
I
was
hurrying
with
quick
stride
past.
"What
the
deuce
is
the
hurry?
Just
so
must
Lot
have
left
Sodom,
when
he
expected
fire
to
pour
down
upon
it,
out
of
burning
brass
clouds."
I
stopped
short,
and
looked
towards
the
speaker.
I
smelt
the
fragrance,
and
saw
the
red
spark
of
a
cigar;
the
dusk
outline
of
a
man,
too,
bent
towards
me
over
the
wicket.
"You
see
I
am
meditating
in
the
field
at
eventide,"
continued
this
shade.
"God
knows
it's
cool
work!
especially
as
instead
of
Rebecca
on
a
camel's
hump,
with
bracelets
on
her
arms
and
a
ring
in
her
nose,
Fate
sends
me
only
a
counting
house
clerk,
in
a
grey
tweed
wrapper."
The
voice
was
familiar
to
me
its
second
utterance
enabled
me
to
seize
the
speaker's
identity.
"Mr.
Hunsden!
good
evening."
"Good
evening,
indeed!
yes,
but
you
would
have
passed
me
without
recognition
if
I
had
not
been
so
civil
as
to
speak
first."
"I
did
not
know
you."
"A
famous
excuse!
You
ought
to
have
known
me;
I
knew
you,
though
you
were
going
ahead
like
a
steam
engine.
Are
the
police
after
you?"
"It
wouldn't
be
worth
their
while;
I'm
not
of
consequence
enough
to
attract
them."
"Alas,
poor
shepherd!
Alack
and
well
a
day!
What
a
theme
for
regret,
and
how
down
in
the
mouth
you
must
be,
judging
from
the
sound
of
your
voice!
But
since
you're
not
running
from
the
police,
from
whom
are
you
running?
the
devil?"
"On
the
contrary,
I
am
going
post
to
him."
"That
is
well
you're
just
in
luck:
this
is
Tuesday
evening;
there
are
scores
of
market
gigs
and
carts
returning
to
Dinneford
to
night;
and
he,
or
some
of
his,
have
a
seat
in
all
regularly;
so,
if
you'll
step
in
and
sit
half
an
hour
in
my
bachelor's
parlour,
you
may
catch
him
as
he
passes
without
much
trouble.
I
think
though
you'd
better
let
him
alone
to
night,
he'll
have
so
many
customers
to
serve;
Tuesday
is
his
busy
day
in
X
and
Dinneford;
come
in
at
all
events."
He
swung
the
wicket
open
as
he
spoke.
"Do
you
really
wish
me
to
go
in?"
I
asked.
"As
you
please
I'm
alone;
your
company
for
an
hour
or
two
would
be
agreeable
to
me;
but,
if
you
don't
choose
to
favour
me
so
far,
I'll
not
press
the
point.
I
hate
to
bore
any
one."
It
suited
me
to
accept
the
invitation
as
it
suited
Hunsden
to
give
it.
I
passed
through
the
gate,
and
followed
him
to
the
front
door,
which
he
opened;
thence
we
traversed
a
passage,
and
entered
his
parlour;
the
door
being
shut,
he
pointed
me
to
an
arm
chair
by
the
hearth;
I
sat
down,
and
glanced
round
me.
It
was
a
comfortable
room,
at
once
snug
and
handsome;
the
bright
grate
was
filled
with
a
genuine
shire
fire,
red,
clear,
and
generous,
no
penurious
South
of
England
embers
heaped
in
the
corner
of
a
grate.
On
the
table
a
shaded
lamp
diffused
around
a
soft,
pleasant,
and
equal
light;
the
furniture
was
almost
luxurious
for
a
young
bachelor,
comprising
a
couch
and
two
very
easy
chairs;
bookshelves
filled
the
recesses
on
each
side
of
the
mantelpiece;
they
were
well
furnished,
and
arranged
with
perfect
order.
The
neatness
of
the
room
suited
my
taste;
I
hate
irregular
and
slovenly
habits.
From
what
I
saw
I
concluded
that
Hunsden's
ideas
on
that
point
corresponded
with
my
own.
While
he
removed
from
the
centre
table
to
the
side
board
a
few
pamphlets
and
periodicals,
I
ran
my
eye
along
the
shelves
of
the
book
case
nearest
me.
French
and
German
works
predominated,
the
old
French
dramatists,
sundry
modern
authors,
Thiers,
Villemain,
Paul
de
Kock,
George
Sand,
Eugene
Sue;
in
German
Goethe,
Schiller,
Zschokke,
Jean
Paul
Richter;
in
English
there
were
works
on
Political
Economy.
I
examined
no
further,
for
Mr.
Hunsden
himself
recalled
my
attention.
"You
shall
have
something,"
said
he,
"for
you
ought
to
feel
disposed
for
refreshment
after
walking
nobody
knows
how
far
on
such
a
Canadian
night
as
this;
but
it
shall
not
be
brandy
and
water,
and
it
shall
not
be
a
bottle
of
port,
nor
ditto
of
sherry.
I
keep
no
such
poison.
I
have
Rhein
wein
for
my
own
drinking,
and
you
may
choose
between
that
and
coffee."
Here
again
Hunsden
suited
me:
if
there
was
one
generally
received
practice
I
abhorred
more
than
another,
it
was
the
habitual
imbibing
of
spirits
and
strong
wines.
I
had,
however,
no
fancy
for
his
acid
German
nectar,
but
I
liked
coffee,
so
I
responded
"Give
me
some
coffee,
Mr.
Hunsden."
I
perceived
my
answer
pleased
him;
he
had
doubtless
expected
to
see
a
chilling
effect
produced
by
his
steady
announcement
that
he
would
give
me
neither
wine
nor
spirits;
he
just
shot
one
searching
glance
at
my
face
to
ascertain
whether
my
cordiality
was
genuine
or
a
mere
feint
of
politeness.
I
smiled,
because
I
quite
understood
him;
and,
while
I
honoured
his
conscientious
firmness,
I
was
amused
at
his
mistrust;
he
seemed
satisfied,
rang
the
bell,
and
ordered
coffee,
which
was
presently
brought;
for
himself,
a
bunch
of
grapes
and
half
a
pint
of
something
sour
sufficed.
My
coffee
was
excellent;
I
told
him
so,
and
expressed
the
shuddering
pity
with
which
his
anchorite
fare
inspired
me.
He
did
not
answer,
and
I
scarcely
think
heard
my
remark.
At
that
moment
one
of
those
momentary
eclipses
I
before
alluded
to
had
come
over
his
face,
extinguishing
his
smile,
and
replacing,
by
an
abstracted
and
alienated
look,
the
customarily
shrewd,
bantering
glance
of
his
eye.
I
employed
the
interval
of
silence
in
a
rapid
scrutiny
of
his
physiognomy.
I
had
never
observed
him
closely
before;
and,
as
my
sight
is
very
short,
I
had
gathered
only
a
vague,
general
idea
of
his
appearance;
I
was
surprised
now,
on
examination,
to
perceive
how
small,
and
even
feminine,
were
his
lineaments;
his
tall
figure,
long
and
dark
locks,
his
voice
and
general
bearing,
had
impressed
me
with
the
notion
of
something
powerful
and
massive;
not
at
all:
my
own
features
were
cast
in
a
harsher
and
squarer
mould
than
his.
I
discerned
that
there
would
be
contrasts
between
his
inward
and
outward
man;
contentions,
too;
for
I
suspected
his
soul
had
more
of
will
and
ambition
than
his
body
had
of
fibre
and
muscle.
Perhaps,
in
these
incompatibilities
of
the
"physique"
with
the
"morale,"
lay
the
secret
of
that
fitful
gloom;
he
WOULD
but
COULD
not,
and
the
athletic
mind
scowled
scorn
on
its
more
fragile
companion.
As
to
his
good
looks,
I
should
have
liked
to
have
a
woman's
opinion
on
that
subject;
it
seemed
to
me
that
his
face
might
produce
the
same
effect
on
a
lady
that
a
very
piquant
and
interesting,
though
scarcely
pretty,
female
face
would
on
a
man.
I
have
mentioned
his
dark
locks
they
were
brushed
sideways
above
a
white
and
sufficiently
expansive
forehead;
his
cheek
had
a
rather
hectic
freshness;
his
features
might
have
done
well
on
canvas,
but
indifferently
in
marble:
they
were
plastic;
character
had
set
a
stamp
upon
each;
expression
re
cast
them
at
her
pleasure,
and
strange
metamorphoses
she
wrought,
giving
him
now
the
mien
of
a
morose
bull,
and
anon
that
of
an
arch
and
mischievous
girl;
more
frequently,
the
two
semblances
were
blent,
and
a
queer,
composite
countenance
they
made.
Starting
from
his
silent
fit,
he
began:
"William!
what
a
fool
you
are
to
live
in
those
dismal
lodgings
of
Mrs.
King's,
when
you
might
take
rooms
here
in
Grove
Street,
and
have
a
garden
like
me!"
"I
should
be
too
far
from
the
mill."
"What
of
that?
It
would
do
you
good
to
walk
there
and
back
two
or
three
times
a
day;
besides,
are
you
such
a
fossil
that
you
never
wish
to
see
a
flower
or
a
green
leaf?"
"I
am
no
fossil."
"What
are
you
then?
You
sit
at
that
desk
in
Crimsworth's
counting
house
day
by
day
and
week
by
week,
scraping
with
a
pen
on
paper,
just
like
an
automaton;
you
never
get
up;
you
never
say
you
are
tired;
you
never
ask
for
a
holiday;
you
never
take
change
or
relaxation;
you
give
way
to
no
excess
of
an
evening;
you
neither
keep
wild
company,
nor
indulge
in
strong
drink."
"Do
you,
Mr.
Hunsden?"
"Don't
think
to
pose
me
with
short
questions;
your
case
and
mine
are
diametrically
different,
and
it
is
nonsense
attempting
to
draw
a
parallel.
I
say,
that
when
a
man
endures
patiently
what
ought
to
be
unendurable,
he
is
a
fossil."
"Whence
do
you
acquire
the
knowledge
of
my
patience?"
"Why,
man,
do
you
suppose
you
are
a
mystery?
The
other
night
you
seemed
surprised
at
my
knowing
to
what
family
you
belonged;
now
you
find
subject
for
wonderment
in
my
calling
you
patient.
What
do
you
think
I
do
with
my
eyes
and
ears?
I've
been
in
your
counting
house
more
than
once
when
Crimsworth
has
treated
you
like
a
dog;
called
for
a
book,
for
instance,
and
when
you
gave
him
the
wrong
one,
or
what
he
chose
to
consider
the
wrong
one,
flung
it
back
almost
in
your
face;
desired
you
to
shut
or
open
the
door
as
if
you
had
been
his
flunkey;
to
say
nothing
of
your
position
at
the
party
about
a
month
ago,
where
you
had
neither
place
nor
partner,
but
hovered
about
like
a
poor,
shabby
hanger
on;
and
how
patient
you
were
under
each
and
all
of
these
circumstances!"
"Well,
Mr.
Hunsden,
what
then?"
"I
can
hardly
tell
you
what
then;
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
as
to
your
character
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
motives
which
guide
your
conduct;
if
you
are
patient
because
you
expect
to
make
something
eventually
out
of
Crimsworth,
notwithstanding
his
tyranny,
or
perhaps
by
means
of
it,
you
are
what
the
world
calls
an
interested
and
mercenary,
but
may
be
a
very
wise
fellow;
if
you
are
patient
because
you
think
it
a
duty
to
meet
insult
with
submission,
you
are
an
essential
sap,
and
in
no
shape
the
man
for
my
money;
if
you
are
patient
because
your
nature
is
phlegmatic,
flat,
inexcitable,
and
that
you
cannot
get
up
to
the
pitch
of
resistance,
why,
God
made
you
to
be
crushed;
and
lie
down
by
all
means,
and
lie
flat,
and
let
Juggernaut
ride
well
over
you."
Mr.
Hunsden's
eloquence
was
not,
it
will
be
perceived,
of
the
smooth
and
oily
order.
As
he
spoke,
he
pleased
me
ill.
I
seem
to
recognize
in
him
one
of
those
characters
who,
sensitive
enough
themselves,
are
selfishly
relentless
towards
the
sensitiveness
of
others.
Moreover,
though
he
was
neither
like
Crimsworth
nor
Lord
Tynedale,
yet
he
was
acrid,
and,
I
suspected,
overbearing
in
his
way:
there
was
a
tone
of
despotism
in
the
urgency
of
the
very
reproaches
by
which
he
aimed
at
goading
the
oppressed
into
rebellion
against
the
oppressor.
Looking
at
him
still
more
fixedly
than
I
had
yet
done,
I
saw
written
in
his
eye
and
mien
a
resolution
to
arrogate
to
himself
a
freedom
so
unlimited
that
it
might
often
trench
on
the
just
liberty
of
his
neighbours.
I
rapidly
ran
over
these
thoughts,
and
then
I
laughed
a
low
and
involuntary
laugh,
moved
thereto
by
a
slight
inward
revelation
of
the
inconsistency
of
man.
It
was
as
I
thought:
Hunsden
had
expected
me
to
take
with
calm
his
incorrect
and
offensive
surmises,
his
bitter
and
haughty
taunts;
and
himself
was
chafed
by
a
laugh,
scarce
louder
than
a
whisper.
His
brow
darkened,
his
thin
nostril
dilated
a
little.
"Yes,"
he
began,
"I
told
you
that
you
were
an
aristocrat,
and
who
but
an
aristocrat
would
laugh
such
a
laugh
as
that,
and
look
such
a
look?
A
laugh
frigidly
jeering;
a
look
lazily
mutinous;
gentlemanlike
irony,
patrician
resentment.
What
a
nobleman
you
would
have
made,
William
Crimsworth!
You
are
cut
out
for
one;
pity
Fortune
has
baulked
Nature!
Look
at
the
features,
figure,
even
to
the
hands
distinction
all
over
ugly
distinction!
Now,
if
you'd
only
an
estate
and
a
mansion,
and
a
park,
and
a
title,
how
you
could
play
the
exclusive,
maintain
the
rights
of
your
class,
train
your
tenantry
in
habits
of
respect
to
the
peerage,
oppose
at
every
step
the
advancing
power
of
the
people,
support
your
rotten
order,
and
be
ready
for
its
sake
to
wade
knee
deep
in
churls'
blood;
as
it
is,
you've
no
power;
you
can
do
nothing;
you're
wrecked
and
stranded
on
the
shores
of
commerce;
forced
into
collision
with
practical
men,
with
whom
you
cannot
cope,
for
YOU'LL
NEVER
BE
A
TRADESMAN."
The
first
part
of
Hunsden's
speech
moved
me
not
at
all,
or,
if
it
did,
it
was
only
to
wonder
at
the
perversion
into
which
prejudice
had
twisted
his
judgment
of
my
character;
the
concluding
sentence,
however,
not
only
moved,
but
shook
me;
the
blow
it
gave
was
a
severe
one,
because
Truth
wielded
the
weapon.
If
I
smiled
now,
it,
was
only
in
disdain
of
myself.
Hunsden
saw
his
advantage;
he
followed
it
up.
"You'll
make
nothing
by
trade,"
continued
he;
"nothing
more
than
the
crust
of
dry
bread
and
the
draught
of
fair
water
on
which
you
now
live;
your
only
chance
of
getting
a
competency
lies
in
marrying
a
rich
widow,
or
running
away
with
an
heiress."
"I
leave
such
shifts
to
be
put
in
practice
by
those
who
devise
them,"
said
I,
rising.
"And
even
that
is
hopeless,"
he
went
on
coolly.
"What
widow
would
have
you?
Much
less,
what
heiress?
You're
not
bold
and
venturesome
enough
for
the
one,
nor
handsome
and
fascinating
enough
for
the
other.
You
think
perhaps
you
look
intelligent
and
polished;
carry
your
intellect
and
refinement
to
market,
and
tell
me
in
a
private
note
what
price
is
bid
for
them."
Mr.
Hunsden
had
taken
his
tone
for
the
night;
the
string
he
struck
was
out
of
tune,
he
would
finger
no
other.
Averse
to
discord,
of
which
I
had
enough
every
day
and
all
day
long,
I
concluded,
at
last,
that
silence
and
solitude
were
preferable
to
jarring
converse;
I
bade
him
good
night.
"What!
Are
you
going,
lad?
Well,
good
night:
you'll
find
the
door."
And
he
sat
still
in
front
of
the
fire,
while
I
left
the
room
and
the
house.
I
had
got
a
good
way
on
my
return
to
my
lodgings
before
I
found
out
that
I
was
walking
very
fast,
and
breathing
very
hard,
and
that
my
nails
were
almost
stuck
into
the
palms
of
my
clenched
hands,
and
that
my
teeth
were
set
fast;
on
making
this
discovery,
I
relaxed
both
my
pace,
fists,
and
jaws,
but
I
could
not
so
soon
cause
the
regrets
rushing
rapidly
through
my
mind
to
slacken
their
tide.
Why
did
I
make
myself
a
tradesman?
Why
did
I
enter
Hunsden's
house
this
evening?
Why,
at
dawn
to
morrow,
must
I
repair
to
Crimsworth's
mill?
All
that
night
did
I
ask
myself
these
questions,
and
all
that
night
fiercely
demanded
of
my
soul
an
answer.
I
got
no
sleep;
my
head
burned,
my
feet
froze;
at
last
the
factory
bells
rang,
and
I
sprang
from
my
bed
with
other
slaves.
THERE
is
a
climax
to
everything,
to
every
state
of
feeling
as
well
as
to
every
position
in
life.
I
turned
this
truism
over
in
my
mind
as,
in
the
frosty
dawn
of
a
January
morning,
I
hurried
down
the
steep
and
now
icy
street
which
descended
from
Mrs.
King's
to
the
Close.
The
factory
workpeople
had
preceded
me
by
nearly
an
hour,
and
the
mill
was
all
lighted
up
and
in
full
operation
when
I
reached
it.
I
repaired
to
my
post
in
the
counting
house
as
usual;
the
fire
there,
but
just
lit,
as
yet
only
smoked;
Steighton
had
not
yet
arrived.
I
shut
the
door
and
sat
down
at
the
desk;
my
hands,
recently
washed
in
half
frozen
water,
were
still
numb;
I
could
not
write
till
they
had
regained
vitality,
so
I
went
on
thinking,
and
still
the
theme
of
my
thoughts
was
the
"climax."
Self
dissatisfaction
troubled
exceedingly
the
current
of
my
meditations.
"Come,
William
Crimsworth,"
said
my
conscience,
or
whatever
it
is
that
within
ourselves
takes
ourselves
to
task
"come,
get
a
clear
notion
of
what
you
would
have,
or
what
you
would
not
have.
You
talk
of
a
climax;
pray
has
your
endurance
reached
its
climax?
It
is
not
four
months
old.
What
a
fine
resolute
fellow
you
imagined
yourself
to
be
when
you
told
Tynedale
you
would
tread
in
your
father's
steps,
and
a
pretty
treading
you
are
likely
to
make
of
it!
How
well
you
like
X
!
Just
at
this
moment
how
redolent
of
pleasant
associations
are
its
streets,
its
shops,
its
warehouses,
its
factories!
How
the
prospect
of
this
day
cheers
you!
Letter
copying
till
noon,
solitary
dinner
at
your
lodgings,
letter
copying
till
evening,
solitude;
for
you
neither
find
pleasure
in
Brown's,
nor
Smith's,
nor
Nicholl's,
nor
Eccle's
company;
and
as
to
Hunsden,
you
fancied
there
was
pleasure
to
be
derived
from
his
society
he!
he!
how
did
you
like
the
taste
you
had
of
him
last
night?
was
it
sweet?
Yet
he
is
a
talented,
an
original
minded
man,
and
even
he
does
not
like
you;
your
self
respect
defies
you
to
like
him;
he
has
always
seen
you
to
disadvantage;
he
always
will
see
you
to
disadvantage;
your
positions
are
unequal,
and
were
they
on
the
same
level
your
minds
could
not
assimilate;
never
hope,
then,
to
gather
the
honey
of
friendship
out
of
that
thorn
guarded
plant.
Hello,
Crimsworth!
where
are
your
thoughts
tending?
You
leave
the
recollection
of
Hunsden
as
a
bee
would
a
rock,
as
a
bird
a
desert;
and
your
aspirations
spread
eager
wings
towards
a
land
of
visions
where,
now
in
advancing
daylight
in
X
daylight
you
dare
to
dream
of
congeniality,
repose,
union.
Those
three
you
will
never
meet
in
this
world;
they
are
angels.
The
souls
of
just
men
made
perfect
may
encounter
them
in
heaven,
but
your
soul
will
never
be
made
perfect.
Eight
o'clock
strikes!
your
hands
are
thawed,
get
to
work!"
"Work?
why
should
I
work?"
said
I
sullenly:
"I
cannot
please
though
I
toil
like
a
slave."
"Work,
work!"
reiterated
the
inward
voice.
"I
may
work,
it
will
do
no
good,"
I
growled;
but
nevertheless
I
drew
out
a
packet
of
letters
and
commenced
my
task
task
thankless
and
bitter
as
that
of
the
Israelite
crawling
over
the
sun
baked
fields
of
Egypt
in
search
of
straw
and
stubble
wherewith
to
accomplish
his
tale
of
bricks.
About
ten
o'clock
I
heard
Mr.
Crimsworth's
gig
turn
into
the
yard,
and
in
a
minute
or
two
he
entered
the
counting
house.
It
was
his
custom
to
glance
his
eye
at
Steighton
and
myself,
to
hang
up
his
mackintosh,
stand
a
minute
with
his
back
to
the
fire,
and
then
walk
out.
Today
he
did
not
deviate
from
his
usual
habits;
the
only
difference
was
that
when
he
looked
at
me,
his
brow,
instead
of
being
merely
hard,
was
surly;
his
eye,
instead
of
being
cold,
was
fierce.
He
studied
me
a
minute
or
two
longer
than
usual,
but
went
out
in
silence.
Twelve
o'clock
arrived;
the
bell
rang
for
a
suspension
of
labour;
the
workpeople
went
off
to
their
dinners;
Steighton,
too,
departed,
desiring
me
to
lock
the
counting
house
door,
and
take
the
key
with
me.
I
was
tying
up
a
bundle
of
papers,
and
putting
them
in
their
place,
preparatory
to
closing
my
desk,
when
Crimsworth
reappeared
at
the
door,
and
entering
closed
it
behind
him.
"You'll
stay
here
a
minute,"
said
he,
in
a
deep,
brutal
voice,
while
his
nostrils
distended
and
his
eye
shot
a
spark
of
sinister
fire.
Alone
with
Edward
I
remembered
our
relationship,
and
remembering
that
forgot
the
difference
of
position;
I
put
away
deference
and
careful
forms
of
speech;
I
answered
with
simple
brevity.
"It
is
time
to
go
home,"
I
said,
turning
the
key
in
my
desk.
"You'll
stay
here!"
he
reiterated.
"And
take
your
hand
off
that
key!
leave
it
in
the
lock!"
"Why?"
asked
I.
"What
cause
is
there
for
changing
my
usual
plans?"
"Do
as
I
order,"
was
the
answer,
"and
no
questions!
You
are
my
servant,
obey
me!
What
have
you
been
about
?"
He
was
going
on
in
the
same
breath,
when
an
abrupt
pause
announced
that
rage
had
for
the
moment
got
the
better
of
articulation.
"You
may
look,
if
you
wish
to
know,"
I
replied.
"There
is
the
open
desk,
there
are
the
papers."
"Confound
your
insolence!
What
have
you
been
about?"
"Your
work,
and
have
done
it
well."
"Hypocrite
and
twaddler!
Smooth
faced,
snivelling
greasehorn!"
(This
last
term
is,
I
believe,
purely
shire,
and
alludes
to
the
horn
of
black,
rancid
whale
oil,
usually
to
be
seen
suspended
to
cart
wheels,
and
employed
for
greasing
the
same.)
"Come,
Edward
Crimsworth,
enough
of
this.
It
is
time
you
and
I
wound
up
accounts.
I
have
now
given
your
service
three
months'
trial,
and
I
find
it
the
most
nauseous
slavery
under
the
sun.
Seek
another
clerk.
I
stay
no
longer."
"What!
do
you
dare
to
give
me
notice?
Stop
at
least
for
your
wages."
He
took
down
the
heavy
gig
whip
hanging
beside
his
mackintosh.
I
permitted
myself
to
laugh
with
a
degree
of
scorn
I
took
no
pains
to
temper
or
hide.
His
fury
boiled
up,
and
when
he
had
sworn
half
a
dozen
vulgar,
impious
oaths,
without,
however,
venturing
to
lift
the
whip,
he
continued:
"I've
found
you
out
and
know
you
thoroughly,
you
mean,
whining
lickspittle!
What
have
you
been
saying
all
over
X
about
me?
answer
me
that!"
"You?
I
have
neither
inclination
nor
temptation
to
talk
about
you."
"You
lie!
It
is
your
practice
to
talk
about
me;
it
is
your
constant
habit
to
make
public
complaint
of
the
treatment
you
receive
at
my
hands.
You
have
gone
and
told
it
far
and
near
that
I
give
you
low
wages
and
knock
you
about
like
a
dog.
I
wish
you
were
a
dog!
I'd
set
to
this
minute,
and
never
stir
from
the
spot
till
I'd
cut
every
strip
of
flesh
from
your
bones
with
this
whip."
He
flourished
his
tool.
The
end
of
the
lash
just
touched
my
forehead.
A
warm
excited
thrill
ran
through
my
veins,
my
blood
seemed
to
give
a
bound,
and
then
raced
fast
and
hot
along
its
channels.
I
got
up
nimbly,
came
round
to
where
he
stood,
and
faced
him.
"Down
with
your
whip!"
said
I,
"and
explain
this
instant
what
you
mean."
"Sirrah!
to
whom
are
you
speaking?"
"To
you.
There
is
no
one
else
present,
I
think.
You
say
I
have
been
calumniating
you
complaining
of
your
low
wages
and
bad
treatment.
Give
your
grounds
for
these
assertions."
Crimsworth
had
no
dignity,
and
when
I
sternly
demanded
an
explanation,
he
gave
one
in
a
loud,
scolding
voice.
"Grounds!
you
shall
have
them;
and
turn
to
the
light
that
I
may
see
your
brazen
face
blush
black,
when
you
hear
yourself
proved
to
be
a
liar
and
a
hypocrite.
At
a
public
meeting
in
the
Town
hall
yesterday,
I
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
myself
insulted
by
the
speaker
opposed
to
me
in
the
question
under
discussion,
by
allusions
to
my
private
affairs;
by
cant
about
monsters
without
natural
affection,
family
despots,
and
such
trash;
and
when
I
rose
to
answer,
I
was
met
by
a
shout
from
the
filthy
mob,
where
the
mention
of
your
name
enabled
me
at
once
to
detect
the
quarter
in
which
this
base
attack
had
originated.
When
I
looked
round,
I
saw
that
treacherous
villain,
Hunsden
acting
as
fugleman.
I
detected
you
in
close
conversation
with
Hunsden
at
my
house
a
month
ago,
and
I
know
that
you
were
at
Hunsden's
rooms
last
night.
Deny
it
if
you
dare."
"Oh,
I
shall
not
deny
it!
And
if
Hunsden
hounded
on
the
people
to
hiss
you,
he
did
quite
right.
You
deserve
popular
execration;
for
a
worse
man,
a
harder
master,
a
more
brutal
brother
than
you
are
has
seldom
existed."
"Sirrah!
sirrah!"
reiterated
Crimsworth;
and
to
complete
his
apostrophe,
he
cracked
the
whip
straight
over
my
head.
A
minute
sufficed
to
wrest
it
from
him,
break
it
in
two
pieces,
and
throw
it
under
the
grate.
He
made
a
headlong
rush
at
me,
which
I
evaded,
and
said
"Touch
me,
and
I'll
have
you
up
before
the
nearest
magistrate."
Men
like
Crimsworth,
if
firmly
and
calmly
resisted,
always
abate
something
of
their
exorbitant
insolence;
he
had
no
mind
to
be
brought
before
a
magistrate,
and
I
suppose
he
saw
I
meant
what
I
said.
After
an
odd
and
long
stare
at
me,
at
once
bull
like
and
amazed,
he
seemed
to
bethink
himself
that,
after
all,
his
money
gave
him
sufficient
superiority
over
a
beggar
like
me,
and
that
he
had
in
his
hands
a
surer
and
more
dignified
mode
of
revenge
than
the
somewhat
hazardous
one
of
personal
chastisement.
"Take
your
hat,"
said
he.
"Take
what
belongs
to
you,
and
go
out
at
that
door;
get
away
to
your
parish,
you
pauper:
beg,
steal,
starve,
get
transported,
do
what
you
like;
but
at
your
peril
venture
again
into
my
sight!
If
ever
I
hear
of
your
setting
foot
on
an
inch
of
ground
belonging
to
me,
I'll
hire
a
man
to
cane
you."
"It
is
not
likely
you'll
have
the
chance;
once
off
your
premises,
what
temptation
can
I
have
to
return
to
them?
I
leave
a
prison,
I
leave
a
tyrant;
I
leave
what
is
worse
than
the
worst
that
can
lie
before
me,
so
no
fear
of
my
coming
back."
"Go,
or
I'll
make
you!"
exclaimed
Crimsworth.
I
walked
deliberately
to
my
desk,
took
out
such
of
its
contents
as
were
my
own
property,
put
them
in
my
pocket,
locked
the
desk,
and
placed
the
key
on
the
top.
"What
are
you
abstracting
from
that
desk?"
demanded
the
millowner.
"Leave
all
behind
in
its
place,
or
I'll
send
for
a
policeman
to
search
you."
"Look
sharp
about
it,
then,"
said
I,
and
I
took
down
my
hat,
drew
on
my
gloves,
and
walked
leisurely
out
of
the
counting
house
walked
out
of
it
to
enter
it
no
more.
I
recollect
that
when
the
mill
bell
rang
the
dinner
hour,
before
Mr.
Crimsworth
entered,
and
the
scene
above
related
took
place,
I
had
had
rather
a
sharp
appetite,
and
had
been
waiting
somewhat
impatiently
to
hear
the
signal
of
feeding
time.
I
forgot
it
now,
however;
the
images
of
potatoes
and
roast
mutton
were
effaced
from
my
mind
by
the
stir
and
tumult
which
the
transaction
of
the
last
half
hour
had
there
excited.
I
only
thought
of
walking,
that
the
action
of
my
muscles
might
harmonize
with
the
action
of
my
nerves;
and
walk
I
did,
fast
and
far.
How
could
I
do
otherwise?
A
load
was
lifted
off
my
heart;
I
felt
light
and
liberated.
I
had
got
away
from
Bigben
Close
without
a
breach
of
resolution;
without
injury
to
my
self
respect.
I
had
not
forced
circumstances;
circumstances
had
freed
me.
Life
was
again
open
to
me;
no
longer
was
its
horizon
limited
by
the
high
black
wall
surrounding
Crimsworth's
mill.
Two
hours
had
elapsed
before
my
sensations
had
so
far
subsided
as
to
leave
me
calm
enough
to
remark
for
what
wider
and
clearer
boundaries
I
had
exchanged
that
sooty
girdle.
When
I
did
look
up,
lo!
straight
before
me
lay
Grovetown,
a
village
of
villas
about
five
miles
out
of
X
.
The
short
winter
day,
as
I
perceived
from
the
far
declined
sun,
was
already
approaching
its
close;
a
chill
frost
mist
was
rising
from
the
river
on
which
X
stands,
and
along
whose
banks
the
road
I
had
taken
lay;
it
dimmed
the
earth,
but
did
not
obscure
the
clear
icy
blue
of
the
January
sky.
There
was
a
great
stillness
near
and
far;
the
time
of
the
day
favoured
tranquillity,
as
the
people
were
all
employed
within
doors,
the
hour
of
evening
release
from
the
factories
not
being
yet
arrived;
a
sound
of
full
flowing
water
alone
pervaded
the
air,
for
the
river
was
deep
and
abundant,
swelled
by
the
melting
of
a
late
snow.
I
stood
awhile,
leaning
over
a
wall;
and
looking
down
at
the
current:
I
watched
the
rapid
rush
of
its
waves.
I
desired
memory
to
take
a
clear
and
permanent
impression
of
the
scene,
and
treasure
it
for
future
years.
Grovetown
church
clock
struck
four;
looking
up,
I
beheld
the
last
of
that
day's
sun,
glinting
red
through
the
leafless
boughs
of
some
very
old
oak
trees
surrounding
the
church
its
light
coloured
and
characterized
the
picture
as
I
wished.
I
paused
yet
a
moment,
till
the
sweet,
slow
sound
of
the
bell
had
quite
died
out
of
the
air;
then
ear,
eye
and
feeling
satisfied,
I
quitted
the
wall
and
once
more
turned
my
face
towards
X
.
I
RE
ENTERED
the
town
a
hungry
man;
the
dinner
I
had
forgotten
recurred
seductively
to
my
recollection;
and
it
was
with
a
quick
step
and
sharp
appetite
I
ascended
the
narrow
street
leading
to
my
lodgings.
It
was
dark
when
I
opened
the
front
door
and
walked
into
the
house.
I
wondered
how
my
fire
would
be;
the
night
was
cold,
and
I
shuddered
at
the
prospect
of
a
grate
full
of
sparkless
cinders.
To
my
joyful
surprise,
I
found,
on
entering
my
sitting
room,
a
good
fire
and
a
clean
hearth.
I
had
hardly
noticed
this
phenomenon,
when
I
became
aware
of
another
subject
for
wonderment;
the
chair
I
usually
occupied
near
the
hearth
was
already
filled;
a
person
sat
there
with
his
arms
folded
on
his
chest,
and
his
legs
stretched
out
on
the
rug.
Short
sighted
as
I
am,
doubtful
as
was
the
gleam
of
the
firelight,
a
moment's
examination
enabled
me
to
recognize
in
this
person
my
acquaintance,
Mr.
Hunsden.
I
could
not
of
course
be
much
pleased
to
see
him,
considering
the
manner
in
which
I
had
parted
from
him
the
night
before,
and
as
I
walked
to
the
hearth,
stirred
the
fire,
and
said
coolly,
"Good
evening,"
my
demeanour
evinced
as
little
cordiality
as
I
felt;
yet
I
wondered
in
my
own
mind
what
had
brought
him
there;
and
I
wondered,
also,
what
motives
had
induced
him
to
interfere
so
actively
between
me
and
Edward;
it
was
to
him,
it
appeared,
that
I
owed
my
welcome
dismissal;
still
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
ask
him
questions,
to
show
any
eagerness
of
curiosity;
if
he
chose
to
explain,
he
might,
but
the
explanation
should
be
a
perfectly
voluntary
one
on
his
part;
I
thought
he
was
entering
upon
it.
"You
owe
me
a
debt
of
gratitude,"
were
his
first
words.
"Do
I?"
said
I;
"I
hope
it
is
not
a
large
one,
for
I
am
much
too
poor
to
charge
myself
with
heavy
liabilities
of
any
kind."
"Then
declare
yourself
bankrupt
at
once,
for
this
liability
is
a
ton
weight
at
least.
When
I
came
in
I
found
your
fire
out,
and
I
had
it
lit
again,
and
made
that
sulky
drab
of
a
servant
stay
and
blow
at
it
with
the
bellows
till
it
had
burnt
up
properly;
now,
say
'Thank
you!'"
"Not
till
I
have
had
something
to
eat;
I
can
thank
nobody
while
I
am
so
famished."
I
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
tea
and
some
cold
meat.
"Cold
meat!"
exclaimed
Hunsden,
as
the
servant
closed
the
door,
"what
a
glutton
you
are;
man!
Meat
with
tea!
you'll
die
of
eating
too
much."
"No,
Mr.
Hunsden,
I
shall
not."
I
felt
a
necessity
for
contradicting
him;
I
was
irritated
with
hunger,
and
irritated
at
seeing
him
there,
and
irritated
at
the
continued
roughness
of
his
manner.
"It
is
over
eating
that
makes
you
so
ill
tempered,"
said
he.
"How
do
you
know?"
I
demanded.
"It
is
like
you
to
give
a
pragmatical
opinion
without
being
acquainted
with
any
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case;
I
have
had
no
dinner."
What
I
said
was
petulant
and
snappish
enough,
and
Hunsden
only
replied
by
looking
in
my
face
and
laughing.
"Poor
thing!"
he
whined,
after
a
pause.
"It
has
had
no
dinner,
has
it?
What!
I
suppose
its
master
would
not
let
it
come
home.
Did
Crimsworth
order
you
to
fast
by
way
of
punishment,
William!"
"No,
Mr.
Hunsden."
Fortunately
at
this
sulky
juncture,
tea,
was
brought
in,
and
I
fell
to
upon
some
bread
and
butter
and
cold
beef
directly.
Having
cleared
a
plateful,
I
became
so
far
humanized
as
to
intimate
to
Mr.
Hunsden
that
he
need
not
sit
there
staring,
but
might
come
to
the
table
and
do
as
I
did,
if
he
liked.
"But
I
don't
like
in
the
least,"
said
he,
and
therewith
he
summoned
the
servant
by
a
fresh
pull
of
the
bell
rope,
and
intimated
a
desire
to
have
a
glass
of
toast
and
water.
"And
some
more
coal,"
he
added;
"Mr.
Crimsworth
shall
keep
a
good
fire
while
I
stay."
His
orders
being
executed,
he
wheeled
his
chair
round
to
the
table,
so
as
to
be
opposite
me.
"Well,"
he
proceeded.
"You
are
out
of
work,
I
suppose."
"Yes,"
said
I;
and
not
disposed
to
show
the
satisfaction
I
felt
on
this
point,
I,
yielding
to
the
whim
of
the
moment,
took
up
the
subject
as
though
I
considered
myself
aggrieved
rather
than
benefited
by
what
had
been
done.
"Yes
thanks
to
you,
I
am.
Crimsworth
turned
me
off
at
a
minute's
notice,
owing
to
some
interference
of
yours
at
a
public
meeting,
I
understand."
"Ah!
what!
he
mentioned
that?
He
observed
me
signalling
the
lads,
did
he?
What
had
he
to
say
about
his
friend
Hunsden
anything
sweet?"
"He
called
you
a
treacherous
villain."
"Oh,
he
hardly
knows
me
yet!
I'm
one
of
those
shy
people
who
don't
come
out
all
at
once,
and
he
is
only
just
beginning
to
make
my
acquaintance,
but
he'll
find
I've
some
good
qualities
excellent
ones!
The
Hunsdens
were
always
unrivalled
at
tracking
a
rascal;
a
downright,
dishonourable
villain
is
their
natural
prey
they
could
not
keep
off
him
wherever
they
met
him;
you
used
the
word
pragmatical
just
now
that
word
is
the
property
of
our
family;
it
has
been
applied
to
us
from
generation
to
generation;
we
have
fine
noses
for
abuses;
we
scent
a
scoundrel
a
mile
off;
we
are
reformers
born,
radical
reformers;
and
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
live
in
the
same
town
with
Crimsworth,
to
come
into
weekly
contact
with
him,
to
witness
some
of
his
conduct
to
you
(for
whom
personally
I
care
nothing;
I
only
consider
the
brutal
injustice
with
which
he
violated
your
natural
claim
to
equality)
I
say
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
be
thus
situated
and
not
feel
the
angel
or
the
demon
of
my
race
at
work
within
me.
I
followed
my
instinct,
opposed
a
tyrant,
and
broke
a
chain."
Now
this
speech
interested
me
much,
both
because
it
brought
out
Hunsden's
character,
and
because
it
explained
his
motives;
it
interested
me
so
much
that
I
forgot
to
reply
to
it,
and
sat
silent,
pondering
over
a
throng
of
ideas
it
had
suggested.
"Are
you
grateful
to
me?"
he
asked,
presently.
In
fact
I
was
grateful,
or
almost
so,
and
I
believe
I
half
liked
him
at
the
moment,
notwithstanding
his
proviso
that
what
he
had
done
was
not
out
of
regard
for
me.
But
human
nature
is
perverse.
Impossible
to
answer
his
blunt
question
in
the
affirmative,
so
I
disclaimed
all
tendency
to
gratitude,
and
advised
him
if
he
expected
any
reward
for
his
championship,
to
look
for
it
in
a
better
world,
as
he
was
not
likely
to
meet
with
it
here.
In
reply
he
termed
me
"a
dry
hearted
aristocratic
scamp,"
whereupon
I
again
charged
him
with
having
taken
the
bread
out
of
my
mouth.
"Your
bread
was
dirty,
man!"
cried
Hunsden
"dirty
and
unwholesome!
It
came
through
the
hands
of
a
tyrant,
for
I
tell
you
Crimsworth
is
a
tyrant,
a
tyrant
to
his
workpeople,
a
tyrant
to
his
clerks,
and
will
some
day
be
a
tyrant
to
his
wife."
"Nonsense!
bread
is
bread,
and
a
salary
is
a
salary.
I've
lost
mine,
and
through
your
means."
"There's
sense
in
what
you
say,
after
all,"
rejoined
Hunsden.
"I
must
say
I
am
rather
agreeably
surprised
to
hear
you
make
so
practical
an
observation
as
that
last.
I
had
imagined
now,
from
my
previous
observation
of
your
character,
that
the
sentimental
delight
you
would
have
taken
in
your
newly
regained
liberty
would,
for
a
while
at
least,
have
effaced
all
ideas
of
forethought
and
prudence.
I
think
better
of
you
for
looking
steadily
to
the
needful."
"Looking
steadily
to
the
needful!
How
can
I
do
otherwise?
I
must
live,
and
to
live
I
must
have
what
you
call
'the
needful,'
which
I
can
only
get
by
working.
I
repeat
it,
you
have
taken
my
work
from
me."
"What
do
you
mean
to
do?"
pursued
Hunsden
coolly.
"You
have
influential
relations;
I
suppose
they'll
soon
provide
you
with
another
place."
"Influential
relations?
Who?
I
should
like
to
know
their
names."
"The
Seacombes."
"Stuff!
I
have
cut
them."
Hunsden
looked
at
me
incredulously.
"I
have,"
said
I,
"and
that
definitively."
"You
must
mean
they
have
cut
you,
William."
"As
you
please.
They
offered
me
their
patronage
on
condition
of
my
entering
the
Church;
I
declined
both
the
terms
and
the
recompence;
I
withdrew
from
my
cold
uncles,
and
preferred
throwing
myself
into
my
elder
brother's
arms,
from
whose
affectionate
embrace
I
am
now
torn
by
the
cruel
intermeddling
of
a
stranger
of
yourself,
in
short."
I
could
not
repress
a
half
smile
as
I
said
this;
a
similar
demi
manifestation
of
feeling
appeared
at
the
same
moment
on
Hunsden's
lips.
"Oh,
I
see!"
said
he,
looking
into
my
eyes,
and
it
was
evident
he
did
see
right
down
into
my
heart.
Having
sat
a
minute
or
two
with
his
chin
resting
on
his
hand,
diligently
occupied
in
the
continued
perusal
of
my
countenance,
he
went
on:
"Seriously,
have
you
then
nothing
to
expect
from
the
Seacombes?"
"Yes,
rejection
and
repulsion.
Why
do
you
ask
me
twice?
How
can
hands
stained
with
the
ink
of
a
counting
house,
soiled
with
the
grease
of
a
wool
warehouse,
ever
again
be
permitted
to
come
into
contact
with
aristocratic
palms?"
"There
would
be
a
difficulty,
no
doubt;
still
you
are
such
a
complete
Seacombe
in
appearance,
feature,
language,
almost
manner,
I
wonder
they
should
disown
you."
"They
have
disowned
me;
so
talk
no
more
about
it."
"Do
you
regret
it,
William?"
"No."
"Why
not,
lad?"
"Because
they
are
not
people
with
whom
I
could
ever
have
had
any
sympathy."
"I
say
you
are
one
of
them."
"That
merely
proves
that
you
know
nothing
at
all
about
it;
I
am
my
mother's
son,
but
not
my
uncles'
nephew."
"Still
one
of
your
uncles
is
a
lord,
though
rather
an
obscure
and
not
a
very
wealthy
one,
and
the
other
a
right
honourable:
you
should
consider
worldly
interest."
"Nonsense,
Mr.
Hunsden.
You
know
or
may
know
that
even
had
I
desired
to
be
submissive
to
my
uncles,
I
could
not
have
stooped
with
a
good
enough
grace
ever
to
have
won
their
favour.
I
should
have
sacrificed
my
own
comfort
and
not
have
gained
their
patronage
in
return."
"Very
likely
so
you
calculated
your
wisest
plan
was
to
follow
your
own
devices
at
once?"
"Exactly.
I
must
follow
my
own
devices
I
must,
till
the
day
of
my
death;
because
I
can
neither
comprehend,
adopt,
nor
work
out
those
of
other
people."
Hunsden
yawned.
"Well,"
said
he,
"in
all
this,
I
see
but
one
thing
clearly
that
is,
that
the
whole
affair
is
no
business
of
mine."
He
stretched
himself
and
again
yawned.
"I
wonder
what
time
it
is,"
he
went
on:
"I
have
an
appointment
for
seven
o'clock."
"Three
quarters
past
six
by
my
watch."
"Well,
then
I'll
go."
He
got
up.
"You'll
not
meddle
with
trade
again?"
said
he,
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece.
"No;
I
think
not."
"You
would
be
a
fool
if
you
did.
Probably,
after
all,
you'll
think
better
of
your
uncles'
proposal
and
go
into
the
Church."
"A
singular
regeneration
must
take
place
in
my
whole
inner
and
outer
man
before
I
do
that.
A
good
clergyman
is
one
of
the
best
of
men."
"Indeed!
Do
you
think
so?"
interrupted
Hunsden,
scoffingly.
"I
do,
and
no
mistake.
But
I
have
not
the
peculiar
points
which
go
to
make
a
good
clergyman;
and
rather
than
adopt
a
profession
for
which
I
have
no
vocation,
I
would
endure
extremities
of
hardship
from
poverty."
"You're
a
mighty
difficult
customer
to
suit.
You
won't
be
a
tradesman
or
a
parson;
you
can't
be
a
lawyer,
or
a
doctor,
or
a
gentleman,
because
you've
no
money.
I'd
recommend
you
to
travel."
"What!
without
money?"
"You
must
travel
in
search
of
money,
man.
You
can
speak
French
with
a
vile
English
accent,
no
doubt
still,
you
can
speak
it.
Go
on
to
the
Continent,
and
see
what
will
turn
up
for
you
there."
"God
knows
I
should
like
to
go!"
exclaimed
I
with
involuntary
ardour.
"Go:
what
the
deuce
hinders
you?
You
may
get
to
Brussels,
for
instance,
for
five
or
six
pounds,
if
you
know
how
to
manage
with
economy."
"Necessity
would
teach
me
if
I
didn't."
"Go,
then,
and
let
your
wits
make
a
way
for
you
when
you
get
there.
I
know
Brussels
almost
as
well
as
I
know
X
,
and
I
am
sure
it
would
suit
such
a
one
as
you
better
than
London."
"But
occupation,
Mr.
Hunsden!
I
must
go
where
occupation
is
to
be
had;
and
how
could
I
get
recommendation,
or
introduction,
or
employment
at
Brussels?"
"There
speaks
the
organ
of
caution.
You
hate
to
advance
a
step
before
you
know
every
inch
of
the
way.
You
haven't
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
pen
and
ink?"
"I
hope
so,"
and
I
produced
writing
materials
with
alacrity;
for
I
guessed
what
he
was
going
to
do.
He
sat
down,
wrote
a
few
lines,
folded,
sealed,
and
addressed
a
letter,
and
held
it
out
to
me.
"There,
Prudence,
there's
a
pioneer
to
hew
down
the
first
rough
difficulties
of
your
path.
I
know
well
enough,
lad,
you
are
not
one
of
those
who
will
run
their
neck
into
a
noose
without
seeing
how
they
are
to
get
it
out
again,
and
you're
right
there.
A
reckless
man
is
my
aversion,
and
nothing
should
ever
persuade
me
to
meddle
with
the
concerns
of
such
a
one.
Those
who
are
reckless
for
themselves
are
generally
ten
times
more
so
for
their
friends."
"This
is
a
letter
of
introduction,
I
suppose?"
said
I,
taking
the
epistle.
"Yes.
With
that
in
your
pocket
you
will
run
no
risk
of
finding
yourself
in
a
state
of
absolute
destitution,
which,
I
know,
you
will
regard
as
a
degradation
so
should
I,
for
that
matter.
The
person
to
whom
you
will
present
it
generally
has
two
or
three
respectable
places
depending
upon
his
recommendation."
"That
will
just
suit
me,"
said
I.
"Well,
and
where's
your
gratitude?"
demanded
Mr.
Hunsden;
"don't
you
know
how
to
say
'Thank
you?'"
"I've
fifteen
pounds
and
a
watch,
which
my
godmother,
whom
I
never
saw,
gave
me
eighteen
years
ago,"
was
my
rather
irrelevant
answer;
and
I
further
avowed
myself
a
happy
man,
and
professed
that
I
did
not
envy
any
being
in
Christendom.
"But
your
gratitude?"
"I
shall
be
off
presently,
Mr.
Hunsden
to
morrow,
if
all
be
well:
I'll
not
stay
a
day
longer
in
X
than
I'm
obliged."
"Very
good
but
it
will
be
decent
to
make
due
acknowledgment
for
the
assistance
you
have
received;
be
quick!
It
is
just
going
to
strike
seven:
I'm
waiting
to
be
thanked."
"Just
stand
out
of
the
way,
will
you,
Mr.
Hunsden:
I
want
a
key
there
is
on
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece.
I'll
pack
my
portmanteau
before
I
go
to
bed."
The
house
clock
struck
seven.
"The
lad
is
a
heathen,"
said
Hunsden,
and
taking
his
hat
from
a
sideboard,
he
left
the
room,
laughing
to
himself.
I
had
half
an
inclination
to
follow
him:
I
really
intended
to
leave
X
the
next
morning,
and
should
certainly
not
have
another
opportunity
of
bidding
him
good
bye.
The
front
door
banged
to.
"Let
him
go,"
said
I,
"we
shall
meet
again
some
day."
READER,
perhaps
you
were
never
in
Belgium?
Haply
you
don't
know
the
physiognomy
of
the
country?
You
have
not
its
lineaments
defined
upon
your
memory,
as
I
have
them
on
mine?
Three
nay
four
pictures
line
the
four
walled
cell
where
are
stored
for
me
the
records
of
the
past.
First,
Eton.
All
in
that
picture
is
in
far
perspective,
receding,
diminutive;
but
freshly
coloured,
green,
dewy,
with
a
spring
sky,
piled
with
glittering
yet
showery
clouds;
for
my
childhood
was
not
all
sunshine
it
had
its
overcast,
its
cold,
its
stormy
hours.
Second,
X
,
huge,
dingy;
the
canvas
cracked
and
smoked;
a
yellow
sky,
sooty
clouds;
no
sun,
no
azure;
the
verdure
of
the
suburbs
blighted
and
sullied
a
very
dreary
scene.
Third,
Belgium;
and
I
will
pause
before
this
landscape.
As
to
the
fourth,
a
curtain
covers
it,
which
I
may
hereafter
withdraw,
or
may
not,
as
suits
my
convenience
and
capacity.
At
any
rate,
for
the
present
it
must
hang
undisturbed.
Belgium!
name
unromantic
and
unpoetic,
yet
name
that
whenever
uttered
has
in
my
ear
a
sound,
in
my
heart
an
echo,
such
as
no
other
assemblage
of
syllables,
however
sweet
or
classic,
can
produce.
Belgium!
I
repeat
the
word,
now
as
I
sit
alone
near
midnight.
It
stirs
my
world
of
the
past
like
a
summons
to
resurrection;
the
graves
unclose,
the
dead
are
raised;
thoughts,
feelings,
memories
that
slept,
are
seen
by
me
ascending
from
the
clouds
haloed
most
of
them
but
while
I
gaze
on
their
vapoury
forms,
and
strive
to
ascertain
definitely
their
outline,
the
sound
which
wakened
them
dies,
and
they
sink,
each
and
all,
like
a
light
wreath
of
mist,
absorbed
in
the
mould,
recalled
to
urns,
resealed
in
monuments.
Farewell,
luminous
phantoms!
This
is
Belgium,
reader.
Look!
don't
call
the
picture
a
flat
or
a
dull
one
it
was
neither
flat
nor
dull
to
me
when
I
first
beheld
it.
When
I
left
Ostend
on
a
mild
February
morning,
and
found
myself
on
the
road
to
Brussels,
nothing
could
look
vapid
to
me.
My
sense
of
enjoyment
possessed
an
edge
whetted
to
the
finest,
untouched,
keen,
exquisite.
I
was
young;
I
had
good
health;
pleasure
and
I
had
never
met;
no
indulgence
of
hers
had
enervated
or
sated
one
faculty
of
my
nature.
Liberty
I
clasped
in
my
arms
for
the
first
time,
and
the
influence
of
her
smile
and
embrace
revived
my
life
like
the
sun
and
the
west
wind.
Yes,
at
that
epoch
I
felt
like
a
morning
traveller
who
doubts
not
that
from
the
hill
he
is
ascending
he
shall
behold
a
glorious
sunrise;
what
if
the
track
be
strait,
steep,
and
stony?
he
sees
it
not;
his
eyes
are
fixed
on
that
summit,
flushed
already,
flushed
and
gilded,
and
having
gained
it
he
is
certain
of
the
scene
beyond.
He
knows
that
the
sun
will
face
him,
that
his
chariot
is
even
now
coming
over
the
eastern
horizon,
and
that
the
herald
breeze
he
feels
on
his
cheek
is
opening
for
the
god's
career
a
clear,
vast
path
of
azure,
amidst
clouds
soft
as
pearl
and
warm
as
flame.
Difficulty
and
toil
were
to
be
my
lot,
but
sustained
by
energy,
drawn
on
by
hopes
as
bright
as
vague,
I
deemed
such
a
lot
no
hardship.
I
mounted
now
the
hill
in
shade;
there
were
pebbles,
inequalities,
briars
in
my
path,
but
my
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
crimson
peak
above;
my
imagination
was
with
the
refulgent
firmament
beyond,
and
I
thought
nothing
of
the
stones
turning
under
my
feet,
or
of
the
thorns
scratching
my
face
and
hands.
I
gazed
often,
and
always
with
delight,
from
the
window
of
the
diligence
(these,
be
it
remembered,
were
not
the
days
of
trains
and
railroads).
Well!
and
what
did
I
see?
I
will
tell
you
faithfully.
Green,
reedy
swamps;
fields
fertile
but
flat,
cultivated
in
patches
that
made
them
look
like
magnified
kitchen
gardens;
belts
of
cut
trees,
formal
as
pollard
willows,
skirting
the
horizon;
narrow
canals,
gliding
slow
by
the
road
side;
painted
Flemish
farmhouses;
some
very
dirty
hovels;
a
gray,
dead
sky;
wet
road,
wet
fields,
wet
house
tops:
not
a
beautiful,
scarcely
a
picturesque
object
met
my
eye
along
the
whole
route;
yet
to
me,
all
was
beautiful,
all
was
more
than
picturesque.
It
continued
fair
so
long
as
daylight
lasted,
though
the
moisture
of
many
preceding
damp
days
had
sodden
the
whole
country;
as
it
grew
dark,
however,
the
rain
recommenced,
and
it
was
through
streaming
and
starless
darkness
my
eye
caught
the
first
gleam
of
the
lights
of
Brussels.
I
saw
little
of
the
city
but
its
lights
that
night.
Having
alighted
from
the
diligence,
a
fiacre
conveyed
me
to
the
Hotel
de
,
where
I
had
been
advised
by
a
fellow
traveller
to
put
up;
having
eaten
a
traveller's
supper,
I
retired
to
bed,
and
slept
a
traveller's
sleep.
Next
morning
I
awoke
from
prolonged
and
sound
repose
with
the
impression
that
I
was
yet
in
X
,
and
perceiving
it
to
be
broad
daylight
I
started
up,
imagining
that
I
had
overslept
myself
and
should
be
behind
time
at
the
counting
house.
The
momentary
and
painful
sense
of
restraint
vanished
before
the
revived
and
reviving
consciousness
of
freedom,
as,
throwing
back
the
white
curtains
of
my
bed,
I
looked
forth
into
a
wide,
lofty
foreign
chamber;
how
different
from
the
small
and
dingy,
though
not
uncomfortable,
apartment
I
had
occupied
for
a
night
or
two
at
a
respectable
inn
in
London
while
waiting
for
the
sailing
of
the
packet!
Yet
far
be
it
from
me
to
profane
the
memory
of
that
little
dingy
room!
It,
too,
is
dear
to
my
soul;
for
there,
as
I
lay
in
quiet
and
darkness,
I
first
heard
the
great
bell
of
St.
Paul's
telling
London
it
was
midnight,
and
well
do
I
recall
the
deep,
deliberate
tones,
so
full
charged
with
colossal
phlegm
and
force.
From
the
small,
narrow
window
of
that
room,
I
first
saw
THE
dome,
looming
through
a
London
mist.
I
suppose
the
sensations,
stirred
by
those
first
sounds,
first
sights,
are
felt
but
once;
treasure
them,
Memory;
seal
them
in
urns,
and
keep
them
in
safe
niches!
Well
I
rose.
Travellers
talk
of
the
apartments
in
foreign
dwellings
being
bare
and
uncomfortable;
I
thought
my
chamber
looked
stately
and
cheerful.
It
had
such
large
windows
CROISEES
that
opened
like
doors,
with
such
broad,
clear
panes
of
glass;
such
a
great
looking
glass
stood
on
my
dressing
table
such
a
fine
mirror
glittered
over
the
mantelpiece
the
painted
floor
looked
so
clean
and
glossy;
when
I
had
dressed
and
was
descending
the
stairs,
the
broad
marble
steps
almost
awed
me,
and
so
did
the
lofty
hall
into
which
they
conducted.
On
the
first
landing
I
met
a
Flemish
housemaid:
she
had
wooden
shoes,
a
short
red
petticoat,
a
printed
cotton
bedgown,
her
face
was
broad,
her
physiognomy
eminently
stupid;
when
I
spoke
to
her
in
French,
she
answered
me
in
Flemish,
with
an
air
the
reverse
of
civil;
yet
I
thought
her
charming;
if
she
was
not
pretty
or
polite,
she
was,
I
conceived,
very
picturesque;
she
reminded
me
of
the
female
figures
in
certain
Dutch
paintings
I
had
seen
in
other
years
at
Seacombe
Hall.
I
repaired
to
the
public
room;
that,
too,
was
very
large
and
very
lofty,
and
warmed
by
a
stove;
the
floor
was
black,
and
the
stove
was
black,
and
most
of
the
furniture
was
black:
yet
I
never
experienced
a
freer
sense
of
exhilaration
than
when
I
sat
down
at
a
very
long,
black
table
(covered,
however,
in
part
by
a
white
cloth),
and,
having
ordered
breakfast,
began
to
pour
out
my
coffee
from
a
little
black
coffee
pot.
The
stove
might
be
dismal
looking
to
some
eyes,
not
to
mine,
but
it
was
indisputably
very
warm,
and
there
were
two
gentlemen
seated
by
it
talking
in
French;
impossible
to
follow
their
rapid
utterance,
or
comprehend
much
of
the
purport
of
what
they
said
yet
French,
in
the
mouths
of
Frenchmen,
or
Belgians
(I
was
not
then
sensible
of
the
horrors
of
the
Belgian
accent)
was
as
music
to
my
ears.
One
of
these
gentlemen
presently
discerned
me
to
be
an
Englishman
no
doubt
from
the
fashion
in
which
I
addressed
the
waiter;
for
I
would
persist
in
speaking
French
in
my
execrable
South
of
England
style,
though
the
man
understood
English.
The
gentleman,
after
looking
towards
me
once
or
twice,
politely
accosted
me
in
very
good
English;
I
remember
I
wished
to
God
that
I
could
speak
French
as
well;
his
fluency
and
correct
pronunciation
impressed
me
for
the
first
time
with
a
due
notion
of
the
cosmopolitan
character
of
the
capital
I
was
in;
it
was
my
first
experience
of
that
skill
in
living
languages
I
afterwards
found
to
be
so
general
in
Brussels.
I
lingered
over
my
breakfast
as
long
as
I
could;
while
it
was
there
on
the
table,
and
while
that
stranger
continued
talking
to
me,
I
was
a
free,
independent
traveller;
but
at
last
the
things
were
removed,
the
two
gentlemen
left
the
room;
suddenly
the
illusion
ceased,
reality
and
business
came
back.
I,
a
bondsman
just
released
from
the
yoke,
freed
for
one
week
from
twenty
one
years
of
constraint,
must,
of
necessity,
resume
the
fetters
of
dependency.
Hardly
had
I
tasted
the
delight
of
being
without
a
master
when
duty
issued
her
stern
mandate:
"Go
forth
and
seek
another
service."
I
never
linger
over
a
painful
and
necessary
task;
I
never
take
pleasure
before
business,
it
is
not
in
my
nature
to
do
so;
impossible
to
enjoy
a
leisurely
walk
over
the
city,
though
I
perceived
the
morning
was
very
fine,
until
I
had
first
presented
Mr.
Hunsden's
letter
of
introduction,
and
got
fairly
on
to
the
track
of
a
new
situation.
Wrenching
my
mind
from
liberty
and
delight,
I
seized
my
hat,
and
forced
my
reluctant
body
out
of
the
Hotel
de
into
the
foreign
street.
It
was
a
fine
day,
but
I
would
not
look
at
the
blue
sky
or
at
the
stately
houses
round
me;
my
mind
was
bent
on
one
thing,
finding
out
"Mr.
Brown,
Numero
,
Rue
Royale,"
for
so
my
letter
was
addressed.
By
dint
of
inquiry
I
succeeded;
I
stood
at
last
at
the
desired
door,
knocked,
asked
for
Mr.
Brown,
and
was
admitted.
Being
shown
into
a
small
breakfast
room,
I
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
an
elderly
gentleman
very
grave,
business
like,
and
respectable
looking.
I
presented
Mr.
Hunsden's
letter;
he
received
me
very
civilly.
After
a
little
desultory
conversation
he
asked
me
if
there
was
anything
in
which
his
advice
or
experience
could
be
of
use.
I
said,
"Yes,"
and
then
proceeded
to
tell
him
that
I
was
not
a
gentleman
of
fortune,
travelling
for
pleasure,
but
an
ex
counting
house
clerk,
who
wanted
employment
of
some
kind,
and
that
immediately
too.
He
replied
that
as
a
friend
of
Mr.
Hunsden's
he
would
be
willing
to
assist
me
as
well
as
he
could.
After
some
meditation
he
named
a
place
in
a
mercantile
house
at
Liege,
and
another
in
a
bookseller's
shop
at
Louvain.
"Clerk
and
shopman!"
murmured
I
to
myself.
"No."
I
shook
my
head.
I
had
tried
the
high
stool;
I
hated
it;
I
believed
there
were
other
occupations
that
would
suit
me
better;
besides
I
did
not
wish
to
leave
Brussels.
"I
know
of
no
place
in
Brussels,"
answered
Mr.
Brown,
"unless
indeed
you
were
disposed
to
turn
your
attention
to
teaching.
I
am
acquainted
with
the
director
of
a
large
establishment
who
is
in
want
of
a
professor
of
English
and
Latin."
I
thought
two
minutes,
then
I
seized
the
idea
eagerly.
"The
very
thing,
sir!"
said
I.
"But,"
asked
he,
"do
you
understand
French
well
enough
to
teach
Belgian
boys
English?"
Fortunately
I
could
answer
this
question
in
the
affirmative;
having
studied
French
under
a
Frenchman,
I
could
speak
the
language
intelligibly
though
not
fluently.
I
could
also
read
it
well,
and
write
it
decently.
"Then,"
pursued
Mr.
Brown,
"I
think
I
can
promise
you
the
place,
for
Monsieur
Pelet
will
not
refuse
a
professor
recommended
by
me;
but
come
here
again
at
five
o'clock
this
afternoon,
and
I
will
introduce
you
to
him."
The
word
"professor"
struck
me.
"I
am
not
a
professor,"
said
I.
"Oh,"
returned
Mr.
Brown,
"professor,
here
in
Belgium,
means
a
teacher,
that
is
all."
My
conscience
thus
quieted,
I
thanked
Mr.
Brown,
and,
for
the
present,
withdrew.
This
time
I
stepped
out
into
the
street
with
a
relieved
heart;
the
task
I
had
imposed
on
myself
for
that
day
was
executed.
I
might
now
take
some
hours
of
holiday.
I
felt
free
to
look
up.
For
the
first
time
I
remarked
the
sparkling
clearness
of
the
air,
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky,
the
gay
clean
aspect
of
the
white
washed
or
painted
houses;
I
saw
what
a
fine
street
was
the
Rue
Royale,
and,
walking
leisurely
along
its
broad
pavement,
I
continued
to
survey
its
stately
hotels,
till
the
palisades,
the
gates,
and
trees
of
the
park
appearing
in
sight,
offered
to
my
eye
a
new
attraction.
I
remember,
before
entering
the
park,
I
stood
awhile
to
contemplate
the
statue
of
General
Belliard,
and
then
I
advanced
to
the
top
of
the
great
staircase
just
beyond,
and
I
looked
down
into
a
narrow
back
street,
which
I
afterwards
learnt
was
called
the
Rue
d'Isabelle.
I
well
recollect
that
my
eye
rested
on
the
green
door
of
a
rather
large
house
opposite,
where,
on
a
brass
plate,
was
inscribed,
"Pensionnat
de
Demoiselles."
Pensionnat!
The
word
excited
an
uneasy
sensation
in
my
mind;
it
seemed
to
speak
of
restraint.
Some
of
the
demoiselles,
externats
no
doubt,
were
at
that
moment
issuing
from
the
door
I
looked
for
a
pretty
face
amongst
them,
but
their
close,
little
French
bonnets
hid
their
features;
in
a
moment
they
were
gone.
I
had
traversed
a
good
deal
of
Brussels
before
five
o'clock
arrived,
but
punctually
as
that
hour
struck
I
was
again
in
the
Rue
Royale.
Re
admitted
to
Mr.
Brown's
breakfast
room,
I
found
him,
as
before,
seated
at
the
table,
and
he
was
not
alone
a
gentleman
stood
by
the
hearth.
Two
words
of
introduction
designated
him
as
my
future
master.
"M.
Pelet,
Mr.
Crimsworth;
Mr.
Crimsworth,
M.
Pelet,"
a
bow
on
each
side
finished
the
ceremony.
I
don't
know
what
sort
of
a
bow
I
made;
an
ordinary
one,
I
suppose,
for
I
was
in
a
tranquil,
commonplace
frame
of
mind;
I
felt
none
of
the
agitation
which
had
troubled
my
first
interview
with
Edward
Crimsworth.
M.
Pelet's
bow
was
extremely
polite,
yet
not
theatrical,
scarcely
French;
he
and
I
were
presently
seated
opposite
to
each
other.
In
a
pleasing
voice,
low,
and,
out
of
consideration
to
my
foreign
ears,
very
distinct
and
deliberate,
M.
Pelet
intimated
that
he
had
just
been
receiving
from
"le
respectable
M.
Brown,"
an
account
of
my
attainments
and
character,
which
relieved
him
from
all
scruple
as
to
the
propriety
of
engaging
me
as
professor
of
English
and
Latin
in
his
establishment;
nevertheless,
for
form's
sake,
he
would
put
a
few
questions
to
test
my
powers.
He
did,
and
expressed
in
flattering
terms
his
satisfaction
at
my
answers.
The
subject
of
salary
next
came
on;
it
was
fixed
at
one
thousand
francs
per
annum,
besides
board
and
lodging.
"And
in
addition,"
suggested
M.
Pelet,
"as
there
will
be
some
hours
in
each
day
during
which
your
services
will
not
be
required
in
my
establishment,
you
may,
in
time,
obtain
employment
in
other
seminaries,
and
thus
turn
your
vacant
moments
to
profitable
account."
I
thought
this
very
kind,
and
indeed
I
found
afterwards
that
the
terms
on
which
M.
Pelet
had
engaged
me
were
really
liberal
for
Brussels;
instruction
being
extremely
cheap
there
on
account
of
the
number
of
teachers.
It
was
further
arranged
that
I
should
be
installed
in
my
new
post
the
very
next
day,
after
which
M.
Pelet
and
I
parted.
Well,
and
what
was
he
like?
and
what
were
my
impressions
concerning
him?
He
was
a
man
of
about
forty
years
of
age,
of
middle
size,
and
rather
emaciated
figure;
his
face
was
pale,
his
cheeks
were
sunk,
and
his
eyes
hollow;
his
features
were
pleasing
and
regular,
they
had
a
French
turn
(for
M.
Pelet
was
no
Fleming,
but
a
Frenchman
both
by
birth
and
parentage),
yet
the
degree
of
harshness
inseparable
from
Gallic
lineaments
was,
in
his
case,
softened
by
a
mild
blue
eye,
and
a
melancholy,
almost
suffering,
expression
of
countenance;
his
physiognomy
was
"fine
et
spirituelle."
I
use
two
French
words
because
they
define
better
than
any
English
terms
the
species
of
intelligence
with
which
his
features
were
imbued.
He
was
altogether
an
interesting
and
prepossessing
personage.
I
wondered
only
at
the
utter
absence
of
all
the
ordinary
characteristics
of
his
profession,
and
almost
feared
he
could
not
be
stern
and
resolute
enough
for
a
schoolmaster.
Externally
at
least
M.
Pelet
presented
an
absolute
contrast
to
my
late
master,
Edward
Crimsworth.
Influenced
by
the
impression
I
had
received
of
his
gentleness,
I
was
a
good
deal
surprised
when,
on
arriving
the
next
day
at
my
new
employer's
house,
and
being
admitted
to
a
first
view
of
what
was
to
be
the
sphere
of
my
future
labours,
namely
the
large,
lofty,
and
well
lighted
schoolrooms,
I
beheld
a
numerous
assemblage
of
pupils,
boys
of
course,
whose
collective
appearance
showed
all
the
signs
of
a
full,
flourishing,
and
well
disciplined
seminary.
As
I
traversed
the
classes
in
company
with
M.
Pelet,
a
profound
silence
reigned
on
all
sides,
and
if
by
chance
a
murmur
or
a
whisper
arose,
one
glance
from
the
pensive
eye
of
this
most
gentle
pedagogue
stilled
it
instantly.
It
was
astonishing,
I
thought,
how
so
mild
a
check
could
prove
so
effectual.
When
I
had
perambulated
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
classes,
M.
Pelet
turned
and
said
to
me
"Would
you
object
to
taking
the
boys
as
they
are,
and
testing
their
proficiency
in
English?"
The
proposal
was
unexpected.
I
had
thought
I
should
have
been
allowed
at
least
three
days
to
prepare;
but
it
is
a
bad
omen
to
commence
any
career
by
hesitation,
so
I
just
stepped
to
the
professor's
desk
near
which
we
stood,
and
faced
the
circle
of
my
pupils.
I
took
a
moment
to
collect
my
thoughts,
and
likewise
to
frame
in
French
the
sentence
by
which
I
proposed
to
open
business.
I
made
it
as
short
as
possible:
"Messieurs,
prenez
vos
livres
de
lecture."
"Anglais
ou
Francais,
monsieur?"
demanded
a
thickset,
moon
faced
young
Flamand
in
a
blouse.
The
answer
was
fortunately
easy:
"Anglais."
I
determined
to
give
myself
as
little
trouble
as
possible
in
this
lesson;
it
would
not
do
yet
to
trust
my
unpractised
tongue
with
the
delivery
of
explanations;
my
accent
and
idiom
would
be
too
open
to
the
criticisms
of
the
young
gentlemen
before
me,
relative
to
whom
I
felt
already
it
would
be
necessary
at
once
to
take
up
an
advantageous
position,
and
I
proceeded
to
employ
means
accordingly.
"Commencez!"
cried
I,
when
they
had
all
produced
their
books.
The
moon
faced
youth
(by
name
Jules
Vanderkelkov,
as
I
afterwards
learnt)
took
the
first
sentence.
The
"livre
de
lecture"
was
the
"Vicar
of
Wakefield,"
much
used
in
foreign
schools
because
it
is
supposed
to
contain
prime
samples
of
conversational
English;
it
might,
however,
have
been
a
Runic
scroll
for
any
resemblance
the
words,
as
enunciated
by
Jules,
bore
to
the
language
in
ordinary
use
amongst
the
natives
of
Great
Britain.
My
God!
how
he
did
snuffle,
snort,
and
wheeze!
All
he
said
was
said
in
his
throat
and
nose,
for
it
is
thus
the
Flamands
speak,
but
I
heard
him
to
the
end
of
his
paragraph
without
proffering
a
word
of
correction,
whereat
he
looked
vastly
self
complacent,
convinced,
no
doubt,
that
he
had
acquitted
himself
like
a
real
born
and
bred
"Anglais."
In
the
same
unmoved
silence
I
listened
to
a
dozen
in
rotation,
and
when
the
twelfth
had
concluded
with
splutter,
hiss,
and
mumble,
I
solemnly
laid
down
the
book.
"Arretez!"
said
I.
There
was
a
pause,
during
which
I
regarded
them
all
with
a
steady
and
somewhat
stern
gaze;
a
dog,
if
stared
at
hard
enough
and
long
enough,
will
show
symptoms
of
embarrassment,
and
so
at
length
did
my
bench
of
Belgians.
Perceiving
that
some
of
the
faces
before
me
were
beginning
to
look
sullen,
and
others
ashamed,
I
slowly
joined
my
hands,
and
ejaculated
in
a
deep
"voix
de
poitrine"
"Comme
c'est
affreux!"
They
looked
at
each
other,
pouted,
coloured,
swung
their
heels;
they
were
not
pleased,
I
saw,
but
they
were
impressed,
and
in
the
way
I
wished
them
to
be.
Having
thus
taken
them
down
a
peg
in
their
self
conceit,
the
next
step
was
to
raise
myself
in
their
estimation;
not
a
very
easy
thing,
considering
that
I
hardly
dared
to
speak
for
fear
of
betraying
my
own
deficiencies.
"Ecoutez,
messieurs!"
said
I,
and
I
endeavoured
to
throw
into
my
accents
the
compassionate
tone
of
a
superior
being,
who,
touched
by
the
extremity
of
the
helplessness,
which
at
first
only
excited
his
scorn,
deigns
at
length
to
bestow
aid.
I
then
began
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
"Vicar
of
Wakefield,"
and
read,
in
a
slow,
distinct
voice,
some
twenty
pages,
they
all
the
while
sitting
mute
and
listening
with
fixed
attention;
by
the
time
I
had
done
nearly
an
hour
had
elapsed.
I
then
rose
and
said:
"C'est
assez
pour
aujourd'hui,
messieurs;
demain
nous
recommencerons,
et
j'espere
que
tout
ira
bien."
With
this
oracular
sentence
I
bowed,
and
in
company
with
M.
Pelet
quitted
the
school
room.
"C'est
bien!
c'est
tres
bien!"
said
my
principal
as
we
entered
his
parlour.
"Je
vois
que
monsieur
a
de
l'adresse;
cela,
me
plait,
car,
dans
l'instruction,
l'adresse
fait
tout
autant
que
le
savoir."
From
the
parlour
M.
Pelet
conducted
me
to
my
apartment,
my
"chambre,"
as
Monsieur
said
with
a
certain
air
of
complacency.
It
was
a
very
small
room,
with
an
excessively
small
bed,
but
M.
Pelet
gave
me
to
understand
that
I
was
to
occupy
it
quite
alone,
which
was
of
course
a
great
comfort.
Yet,
though
so
limited
in
dimensions,
it
had
two
windows.
Light
not
being
taxed
in
Belgium,
the
people
never
grudge
its
admission
into
their
houses;
just
here,
however,
this
observation
is
not
very
APROPOS,
for
one
of
these
windows
was
boarded
up;
the
open
windows
looked
into
the
boys'
playground.
I
glanced
at
the
other,
as
wondering
what
aspect
it
would
present
if
disencumbered
of
the
boards.
M.
Pelet
read,
I
suppose,
the
expression
of
my
eye;
he
explained:
"La
fenetre
fermee
donne
sur
un
jardin
appartenant
a
un
pensionnat
de
demoiselles,"
said
he,
"et
les
convenances
exigent
enfin,
vous
comprenez
n'est
ce
pas,
monsieur?"
"Oui,
oui,"
was
my
reply,
and
I
looked
of
course
quite
satisfied;
but
when
M.
Pelet
had
retired
and
closed
the
door
after
him,
the
first
thing
I
did
was
to
scrutinize
closely
the
nailed
boards,
hoping
to
find
some
chink
or
crevice
which
I
might
enlarge,
and
so
get
a
peep
at
the
consecrated
ground.
My
researches
were
vain,
for
the
boards
were
well
joined
and
strongly
nailed.
It
is
astonishing
how
disappointed
I
felt.
I
thought
it
would
have
been
so
pleasant
to
have
looked
out
upon
a
garden
planted
with
flowers
and
trees,
so
amusing
to
have
watched
the
demoiselles
at
their
play;
to
have
studied
female
character
in
a
variety
of
phases,
myself
the
while
sheltered
from
view
by
a
modest
muslin
curtain,
whereas,
owing
doubtless
to
the
absurd
scruples
of
some
old
duenna
of
a
directress,
I
had
now
only
the
option
of
looking
at
a
bare
gravelled
court,
with
an
enormous
"pas
de
geant"
in
the
middle,
and
the
monotonous
walls
and
windows
of
a
boys'
school
house
round.
Not
only
then,
but
many
a
time
after,
especially
in
moments
of
weariness
and
low
spirits,
did
I
look
with
dissatisfied
eyes
on
that
most
tantalizing
board,
longing
to
tear
it
away
and
get
a
glimpse
of
the
green
region
which
I
imagined
to
lie
beyond.
I
knew
a
tree
grew
close
up
to
the
window,
for
though
there
were
as
yet
no
leaves
to
rustle,
I
often
heard
at
night
the
tapping
of
branches
against
the
panes.
In
the
daytime,
when
I
listened
attentively,
I
could
hear,
even
through
the
boards,
the
voices
of
the
demoiselles
in
their
hours
of
recreation,
and,
to
speak
the
honest
truth,
my
sentimental
reflections
were
occasionally
a
trifle
disarranged
by
the
not
quite
silvery,
in
fact
the
too
often
brazen
sounds,
which,
rising
from
the
unseen
paradise
below,
penetrated
clamorously
into
my
solitude.
Not
to
mince
matters,
it
really
seemed
to
me
a
doubtful
case
whether
the
lungs
of
Mdlle.
Reuter's
girls
or
those
of
M.
Pelet's
boys
were
the
strongest,
and
when
it
came
to
shrieking
the
girls
indisputably
beat
the
boys
hollow.
I
forgot
to
say,
by
the
by,
that
Reuter
was
the
name
of
the
old
lady
who
had
had
my
window
bearded
up.
I
say
old,
for
such
I,
of
course,
concluded
her
to
be,
judging
from
her
cautious,
chaperon
like
proceedings;
besides,
nobody
ever
spoke
of
her
as
young.
I
remember
I
was
very
much
amused
when
I
first
heard
her
Christian
name;
it
was
Zoraide
Mademoiselle
Zoraide
Reuter.
But
the
continental
nations
do
allow
themselves
vagaries
in
the
choice
of
names,
such
as
we
sober
English
never
run
into.
I
think,
indeed,
we
have
too
limited
a
list
to
choose
from.
Meantime
my
path
was
gradually
growing
smooth
before
me.
I,
in
a
few
weeks,
conquered
the
teasing
difficulties
inseparable
from
the
commencement
of
almost
every
career.
Ere
long
I
had
acquired
as
much
facility
in
speaking
French
as
set
me
at
my
ease
with
my
pupils;
and
as
I
had
encountered
them
on
a
right
footing
at
the
very
beginning,
and
continued
tenaciously
to
retain
the
advantage
I
had
early
gained,
they
never
attempted
mutiny,
which
circumstance,
all
who
are
in
any
degree
acquainted
with
the
ongoings
of
Belgian
schools,
and
who
know
the
relation
in
which
professors
and
pupils
too
frequently
stand
towards
each
other
in
those
establishments,
will
consider
an
important
and
uncommon
one.
Before
concluding
this
chapter
I
will
say
a
word
on
the
system
I
pursued
with
regard
to
my
classes:
my
experience
may
possibly
be
of
use
to
others.
It
did
not
require
very
keen
observation
to
detect
the
character
of
the
youth
of
Brabant,
but
it
needed
a
certain
degree
of
tact
to
adopt
one's
measures
to
their
capacity.
Their
intellectual
faculties
were
generally
weak,
their
animal
propensities
strong;
thus
there
was
at
once
an
impotence
and
a
kind
of
inert
force
in
their
natures;
they
were
dull,
but
they
were
also
singularly
stubborn,
heavy
as
lead
and,
like
lead,
most
difficult
to
move.
Such
being
the
case,
it
would
have
been
truly
absurd
to
exact
from
them
much
in
the
way
of
mental
exertion;
having
short
memories,
dense
intelligence,
feeble
reflective
powers,
they
recoiled
with
repugnance
from
any
occupation
that
demanded
close
study
or
deep
thought.
Had
the
abhorred
effort
been
extorted
from
them
by
injudicious
and
arbitrary
measures
on
the
part
of
the
Professor,
they
would
have
resisted
as
obstinately,
as
clamorously,
as
desperate
swine;
and
though
not
brave
singly,
they
were
relentless
acting
EN
MASSE.
I
understood
that
before
my
arrival
in
M.
Pelet's
establishment,
the
combined
insubordination
of
the
pupils
had
effected
the
dismissal
of
more
than
one
English
master.
It
was
necessary
then
to
exact
only
the
most
moderate
application
from
natures
so
little
qualified
to
apply
to
assist,
in
every
practicable
way,
understandings
so
opaque
and
contracted
to
be
ever
gentle,
considerate,
yielding
even,
to
a
certain
point,
with
dispositions
so
irrationally
perverse;
but,
having
reached
that
culminating
point
of
indulgence,
you
must
fix
your
foot,
plant
it,
root
it
in
rock
become
immutable
as
the
towers
of
Ste.
Gudule;
for
a
step
but
half
a
step
farther,
and
you
would
plunge
headlong
into
the
gulf
of
imbecility;
there
lodged,
you
would
speedily
receive
proofs
of
Flemish
gratitude
and
magnanimity
in
showers
of
Brabant
saliva
and
handfuls
of
Low
Country
mud.
You
might
smooth
to
the
utmost
the
path
of
learning,
remove
every
pebble
from
the
track;
but
then
you
must
finally
insist
with
decision
on
the
pupil
taking
your
arm
and
allowing
himself
to
be
led
quietly
along
the
prepared
road.
When
I
had
brought
down
my
lesson
to
the
lowest
level
of
my
dullest
pupil's
capacity
when
I
had
shown
myself
the
mildest,
the
most
tolerant
of
masters
a
word
of
impertinence,
a
movement
of
disobedience,
changed
me
at
once
into
a
despot.
I
offered
then
but
one
alternative
submission
and
acknowledgment
of
error,
or
ignominious
expulsion.
This
system
answered,
and
my
influence,
by
degrees,
became
established
on
a
firm
basis.
"The
boy
is
father
to
the
man,"
it
is
said;
and
so
I
often
thought
when
looked
at
my
boys
and
remembered
the
political
history
of
their
ancestors.
Pelet's
school
was
merely
an
epitome
of
the
Belgian
nation.
AND
Pelet
himself?
How
did
I
continue
to
like
him?
Oh,
extremely
well!
Nothing
could
be
more
smooth,
gentlemanlike,
and
even
friendly,
than
his
demeanour
to
me.
I
had
to
endure
from
him
neither
cold
neglect,
irritating
interference,
nor
pretentious
assumption
of
superiority.
I
fear,
however,
two
poor,
hard
worked
Belgian
ushers
in
the
establishment
could
not
have
said
as
much;
to
them
the
director's
manner
was
invariably
dry,
stern,
and
cool.
I
believe
he
perceived
once
or
twice
that
I
was
a
little
shocked
at
the
difference
he
made
between
them
and
me,
and
accounted
for
it
by
saying,
with
a
quiet
sarcastic
smile
"Ce
ne
sont
que
des
Flamands
allez!"
And
then
he
took
his
cigar
gently
from
his
lips
and
spat
on
the
painted
floor
of
the
room
in
which
we
were
sitting.
Flamands
certainly
they
were,
and
both
had
the
true
Flamand
physiognomy,
where
intellectual
inferiority
is
marked
in
lines
none
can
mistake;
still
they
were
men,
and,
in
the
main,
honest
men;
and
I
could
not
see
why
their
being
aboriginals
of
the
flat,
dull
soil
should
serve
as
a
pretext
for
treating
them
with
perpetual
severity
and
contempt.
This
idea,
of
injustice
somewhat
poisoned
the
pleasure
I
might
otherwise
have
derived
from
Pelet's
soft
affable
manner
to
myself.
Certainly
it
was
agreeable,
when
the
day's
work
was
over,
to
find
one's
employer
an
intelligent
and
cheerful
companion;
and
if
he
was
sometimes
a
little
sarcastic
and
sometimes
a
little
too
insinuating,
and
if
I
did
discover
that
his
mildness
was
more
a
matter
of
appearance
than
of
reality
if
I
did
occasionally
suspect
the
existence
of
flint
or
steel
under
an
external
covering
of
velvet
still
we
are
none
of
us
perfect;
and
weary
as
I
was
of
the
atmosphere
of
brutality
and
insolence
in
which
I
had
constantly
lived
at
X
,
I
had
no
inclination
now,
on
casting
anchor
in
calmer
regions,
to
institute
at
once
a
prying
search
after
defects
that
were
scrupulously
withdrawn
and
carefully
veiled
from
my
view.
I
was
willing
to
take
Pelet
for
what
he
seemed
to
believe
him
benevolent
and
friendly
until
some
untoward
event
should
prove
him
otherwise.
He
was
not
married,
and
I
soon
perceived
he
had
all
a
Frenchman's,
all
a
Parisian's
notions
about
matrimony
and
women.
I
suspected
a
degree
of
laxity
in
his
code
of
morals,
there
was
something
so
cold
and
BLASE
in
his
tone
whenever
he
alluded
to
what
he
called
"le
beau
sexe;"
but
he
was
too
gentlemanlike
to
intrude
topics
I
did
not
invite,
and
as
he
was
really
intelligent
and
really
fond
of
intellectual
subjects
of
discourse,
he
and
I
always
found
enough
to
talk
about,
without
seeking
themes
in
the
mire.
I
hated
his
fashion
of
mentioning
love;
I
abhorred,
from
my
soul,
mere
licentiousness.
He
felt
the
difference
of
our
notions,
and,
by
mutual
consent,
we
kept
off
ground
debateable.
Pelet's
house
was
kept
and
his
kitchen
managed
by
his
mother,
a
real
old
Frenchwoman;
she
had
been
handsome
at
least
she
told
me
so,
and
I
strove
to
believe
her;
she
was
now
ugly,
as
only
continental
old
women
can
be;
perhaps,
though,
her
style
of
dress
made
her
look
uglier
than
she
really
was.
Indoors
she
would
go
about
without
cap,
her
grey
hair
strangely
dishevelled;
then,
when
at
home,
she
seldom
wore
a
gown
only
a
shabby
cotton
camisole;
shoes,
too,
were
strangers
to
her
feet,
and
in
lieu
of
them
she
sported
roomy
slippers,
trodden
down
at
the
heels.
On
the
other
hand,
whenever
it
was
her
pleasure
to
appear
abroad,
as
on
Sundays
and
fete
days,
she
would
put
on
some
very
brilliant
coloured
dress,
usually
of
thin
texture,
a
silk
bonnet
with
a
wreath
of
flowers,
and
a
very
fine
shawl.
She
was
not,
in
the
main,
an
ill
natured
old
woman,
but
an
incessant
and
most
indiscreet
talker;
she
kept
chiefly
in
and
about
the
kitchen,
and
seemed
rather
to
avoid
her
son's
august
presence;
of
him,
indeed,
she
evidently
stood
in
awe.
When
he
reproved
her,
his
reproofs
were
bitter
and
unsparing;
but
he
seldom
gave
himself
that
trouble.
Madame
Pelet
had
her
own
society,
her
own
circle
of
chosen
visitors,
whom,
however,
I
seldom
saw,
as
she
generally
entertained
them
in
what
she
called
her
"cabinet,"
a
small
den
of
a
place
adjoining
the
kitchen,
and
descending
into
it
by
one
or
two
steps.
On
these
steps,
by
the
by,
I
have
not
unfrequently
seen
Madame
Pelet
seated
with
a
trencher
on
her
knee,
engaged
in
the
threefold
employment
of
eating
her
dinner,
gossiping
with
her
favourite
servant,
the
housemaid,
and
scolding
her
antagonist,
the
cook;
she
never
dined,
and
seldom
indeed
took
any
meal
with
her
son;
and
as
to
showing
her
face
at
the
boys'
table,
that
was
quite
out
of
the
question.
These
details
will
sound
very
odd
in
English
ears,
but
Belgium
is
not
England,
and
its
ways
are
not
our
ways.
Madame
Pelet's
habits
of
life,
then,
being
taken
into
consideration,
I
was
a
good
deal
surprised
when,
one
Thursday
evening
(Thursday
was
always
a
half
holiday),
as
I
was
sitting
all
alone
in
my
apartment,
correcting
a
huge
pile
of
English
and
Latin
exercises,
a
servant
tapped
at
the
door,
and,
on
its
being
opened,
presented
Madame
Pelet's
compliments,
and
she
would
be
happy
to
see
me
to
take
my
"gouter"
(a
meal
which
answers
to
our
English
"tea")
with
her
in
the
dining
room.
"Plait
il?"
said
I,
for
I
thought
I
must
have
misunderstood,
the
message
and
invitation
were
so
unusual;
the
same
words
were
repeated.
I
accepted,
of
course,
and
as
I
descended
the
stairs,
I
wondered
what
whim
had
entered
the
old
lady's
brain;
her
son
was
out
gone
to
pass
the
evening
at
the
Salle
of
the
Grande
Harmonie
or
some
other
club
of
which
he
was
a
member.
Just
as
I
laid
my
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
dining
room
door,
a
queer
idea
glanced
across
my
mind.
"Surely
she's
not
going
to
make
love
to
me,"
said
I.
"I've
heard
of
old
Frenchwomen
doing
odd
things
in
that
line;
and
the
gouter?
They
generally
begin
such
affairs
with
eating
and
drinking,
I
believe."
There
was
a
fearful
dismay
in
this
suggestion
of
my
excited
imagination,
and
if
I
had
allowed
myself
time
to
dwell
upon
it,
I
should
no
doubt
have
cut
there
and
then,
rushed
back
to
my
chamber,
and
bolted
myself
in;
but
whenever
a
danger
or
a
horror
is
veiled
with
uncertainty,
the
primary
wish
of
the
mind
is
to
ascertain
first
the
naked
truth,
reserving
the
expedient
of
flight
for
the
moment
when
its
dread
anticipation
shall
be
realized.
I
turned
the
door
handle,
and
in
an
instant
had
crossed
the
fatal
threshold,
closed
the
door
behind
me,
and
stood
in
the
presence
of
Madame
Pelet.
Gracious
heavens!
The
first
view
of
her
seemed
to
confirm
my
worst
apprehensions.
There
she
sat,
dressed
out
in
a
light
green
muslin
gown,
on
her
head
a
lace
cap
with
flourishing
red
roses
in
the
frill;
her
table
was
carefully
spread;
there
were
fruit,
cakes,
and
coffee,
with
a
bottle
of
something
I
did
not
know
what.
Already
the
cold
sweat
started
on
my
brow,
already
I
glanced
back
over
my
shoulder
at
the
closed
door,
when,
to
my
unspeakable
relief,
my
eye,
wandering
mildly
in
the
direction
of
the
stove,
rested
upon
a
second
figure,
seated
in
a
large
fauteuil
beside
it.
This
was
a
woman,
too,
and,
moreover,
an
old
woman,
and
as
fat
and
as
rubicund
as
Madame
Pelet
was
meagre
and
yellow;
her
attire
was
likewise
very
fine,
and
spring
flowers
of
different
hues
circled
in
a
bright
wreath
the
crown
of
her
violet
coloured
velvet
bonnet.
I
had
only
time
to
make
these
general
observations
when
Madame
Pelet,
coming
forward
with
what
she
intended
should
be
a
graceful
and
elastic
step,
thus
accosted
me:
"Monsieur
is
indeed
most
obliging
to
quit
his
books,
his
studies,
at
the
request
of
an
insignificant
person
like
me
will
Monsieur
complete
his
kindness
by
allowing
me
to
present
him
to
my
dear
friend
Madame
Reuter,
who
resides
in
the
neighbouring
house
the
young
ladies'
school."
"Ah!"
thought
I,
"I
knew
she
was
old,"
and
I
bowed
and
took
my
seat.
Madame
Reuter
placed
herself
at
the
table
opposite
to
me.
"How
do
you
like
Belgium,
Monsieur?"
asked
she,
in
an
accent
of
the
broadest
Bruxellois.
I
could
now
well
distinguish
the
difference
between
the
fine
and
pure
Parisian
utterance
of
M.
Pelet,
for
instance,
and
the
guttural
enunciation
of
the
Flamands.
I
answered
politely,
and
then
wondered
how
so
coarse
and
clumsy
an
old
woman
as
the
one
before
me
should
be
at
the
head
of
a
ladies'
seminary,
which
I
had
always
heard
spoken
of
in
terms
of
high
commendation.
In
truth
there
was
something
to
wonder
at.
Madame
Reuter
looked
more
like
a
joyous,
free
living
old
Flemish
fermiere,
or
even
a
maitresse
d'auberge,
than
a
staid,
grave,
rigid
directrice
de
pensionnat.
In
general
the
continental,
or
at
least
the
Belgian
old
women
permit
themselves
a
licence
of
manners,
speech,
and
aspect,
such
as
our
venerable
granddames
would
recoil
from
as
absolutely
disreputable,
and
Madame
Reuter's
jolly
face
bore
evidence
that
she
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
of
her
country;
there
was
a
twinkle
and
leer
in
her
left
eye;
her
right
she
kept
habitually
half
shut,
which
I
thought
very
odd
indeed.
After
several
vain
attempts
to
comprehend
the
motives
of
these
two
droll
old
creatures
for
inviting
me
to
join
them
at
their
gouter,
I
at
last
fairly
gave
it
up,
and
resigning
myself
to
inevitable
mystification,
I
sat
and
looked
first
at
one,
then
at
the
other,
taking
care
meantime
to
do
justice
to
the
confitures,
cakes,
and
coffee,
with
which
they
amply
supplied
me.
They,
too,
ate,
and
that
with
no
delicate
appetite,
and
having
demolished
a
large
portion
of
the
solids,
they
proposed
a
"petit
verre."
I
declined.
Not
so
Mesdames
Pelet
and
Reuter;
each
mixed
herself
what
I
thought
rather
a
stiff
tumbler
of
punch,
and
placing
it
on
a
stand
near
the
stove,
they
drew
up
their
chairs
to
that
convenience,
and
invited
me
to
do
the
same.
I
obeyed;
and
being
seated
fairly
between
them,
I
was
thus
addressed
first
by
Madame
Pelet,
then
by
Madame
Reuter.
"We
will
now
speak
of
business,"
said
Madame
Pelet,
and
she
went
on
to
make
an
elaborate
speech,
which,
being
interpreted,
was
to
the
effect
that
she
had
asked
for
the
pleasure
of
my
company
that
evening
in
order
to
give
her
friend
Madame
Reuter
an
opportunity
of
broaching
an
important
proposal,
which
might
turn
out
greatly
to
my
advantage.
"Pourvu
que
vous
soyez
sage,"
said
Madame
Reuter,
"et
a
vrai
dire,
vous
en
avez
bien
l'air.
Take
one
drop
of
the
punch"
(or
ponche,
as
she
pronounced
it);
"it
is
an
agreeable
and
wholesome
beverage
after
a
full
meal."
I
bowed,
but
again
declined
it.
She
went
on:
"I
feel,"
said
she,
after
a
solemn
sip
"I
feel
profoundly
the
importance
of
the
commission
with
which
my
dear
daughter
has
entrusted
me,
for
you
are
aware,
Monsieur,
that
it
is
my
daughter
who
directs
the
establishment
in
the
next
house?"
"Ah!
I
thought
it
was
yourself,
madame."
Though,
indeed,
at
that
moment
I
recollected
that
it
was
called
Mademoiselle,
not
Madame
Reuter's
pensionnat.
"I!
Oh,
no!
I
manage
the
house
and
look
after
the
servants,
as
my
friend
Madame
Pelet
does
for
Monsieur
her
son
nothing
more.
Ah!
you
thought
I
gave
lessons
in
class
did
you?"
And
she
laughed
loud
and
long,
as
though
the
idea
tickled
her
fancy
amazingly.
"Madame
is
in
the
wrong
to
laugh,"
I
observed;
"if
she
does
not
give
lessons,
I
am
sure
it
is
not
because
she
cannot;"
and
I
whipped
out
a
white
pocket
handkerchief
and
wafted
it,
with
a
French
grace,
past
my
nose,
bowing
at
the
same
time.
"Quel
charmant
jeune
homme!"
murmured
Madame
Pelet
in
a
low
voice.
Madame
Reuter,
being
less
sentimental,
as
she
was
Flamand
and
not
French,
only
laughed
again.
"You
are
a
dangerous
person,
I
fear,"
said
she;
"if
you
can
forge
compliments
at
that
rate,
Zoraide
will
positively
be
afraid
of
you;
but
if
you
are
good,
I
will
keep
your
secret,
and
not
tell
her
how
well
you
can
flatter.
Now,
listen
what
sort
of
a
proposal
she
makes
to
you.
She
has
heard
that
you
are
an
excellent
professor,
and
as
she
wishes
to
get
the
very
best
masters
for
her
school
(car
Zoraide
fait
tout
comme
une
reine,
c'est
une
veritable
maitresse
femme),
she
has
commissioned
me
to
step
over
this
afternoon,
and
sound
Madame
Pelet
as
to
the
possibility
of
engaging
you.
Zoraide
is
a
wary
general;
she
never
advances
without
first
examining
well
her
ground.
I
don't
think
she
would
be
pleased
if
she
knew
I
had
already
disclosed
her
intentions
to
you;
she
did
not
order
me
to
go
so
far,
but
I
thought
there
would
be
no
harm
in
letting
you
into
the
secret,
and
Madame
Pelet
was
of
the
same
opinion.
Take
care,
however,
you
don't
betray
either
of
us
to
Zoraide
to
my
daughter,
I
mean;
she
is
so
discreet
and
circumspect
herself,
she
cannot
understand
that
one
should
find
a
pleasure
in
gossiping
a
little
"
"C'est
absolument
comme
mon
fils!"
cried
Madame
Pelet.
"All
the
world
is
so
changed
since
our
girlhood!"
rejoined
the
other:
"young
people
have
such
old
heads
now.
But
to
return,
Monsieur.
Madame
Pelet
will
mention
the
subject
of
your
giving
lessons
in
my
daughter's
establishment
to
her
son,
and
he
will
speak
to
you;
and
then
to
morrow,
you
will
step
over
to
our
house,
and
ask
to
see
my
daughter,
and
you
will
introduce
the
subject
as
if
the
first
intimation
of
it
had
reached
you
from
M.
Pelet
himself,
and
be
sure
you
never
mention
my
name,
for
I
would
not
displease
Zoraide
on
any
account."
"Bien!
bien!"
interrupted
I
for
all
this
chatter
and
circumlocution
began
to
bore
me
very
much;
"I
will
consult
M.
Pelet,
and
the
thing
shall
be
settled
as
you
desire.
Good
evening,
mesdames
I
am
infinitely
obliged
to
you."
"Comment!
vous
vous
en
allez
deja?"
exclaimed
Madame
Pelet.
"Prenez
encore
quelquechose,
monsieur;
une
pomme
cuite,
des
biscuits,
encore
une
tasse
de
cafe?"
"Merci,
merci,
madame
au
revoir."
And
I
backed
at
last
out
of
the
apartment.
Having
regained
my
own
room,
I
set
myself
to
turn
over
in
my
mind
the
incident
of
the
evening.
It
seemed
a
queer
affair
altogether,
and
queerly
managed;
the
two
old
women
had
made
quite
a
little
intricate
mess
of
it;
still
I
found
that
the
uppermost
feeling
in
my
mind
on
the
subject
was
one
of
satisfaction.
In
the
first
place
it
would
be
a
change
to
give
lessons
in
another
seminary,
and
then
to
teach
young
ladies
would
be
an
occupation
so
interesting
to
be
admitted
at
all
into
a
ladies'
boarding
school
would
be
an
incident
so
new
in
my
life.
Besides,
thought
I,
as
I
glanced
at
the
boarded
window,
"I
shall
now
at
last
see
the
mysterious
garden:
I
shall
gaze
both
on
the
angels
and
their
Eden."
M.
PELET
could
not
of
course
object
to
the
proposal
made
by
Mdlle.
Reuter;
permission
to
accept
such
additional
employment,
should
it
offer,
having
formed
an
article
of
the
terms
on
which
he
had
engaged
me.
It
was,
therefore,
arranged
in
the
course
of
next
day
that
I
should
be
at
liberty
to
give
lessons
in
Mdlle.
Reuter's
establishment
four
afternoons
in
every
week.
When
evening
came
I
prepared
to
step
over
in
order
to
seek
a
conference
with
Mademoiselle
herself
on
the
subject;
I
had
not
had
time
to
pay
the
visit
before,
having
been
all
day
closely
occupied
in
class.
I
remember
very
well
that
before
quitting
my
chamber,
I
held
a
brief
debate
with
myself
as
to
whether
I
should
change
my
ordinary
attire
for
something
smarter.
At
last
I
concluded
it
would
be
a
waste
of
labour.
"Doubtless,"
thought
I,
"she
is
some
stiff
old
maid;
for
though
the
daughter
of
Madame
Reuter,
she
may
well
number
upwards
of
forty
winters;
besides,
if
it
were
otherwise,
if
she
be
both
young
and
pretty,
I
am
not
handsome,
and
no
dressing
can
make
me
so,
therefore
I'll
go
as
I
am."
And
off
I
started,
cursorily
glancing
sideways
as
I
passed
the
toilet
table,
surmounted
by
a
looking
glass:
a
thin
irregular
face
I
saw,
with
sunk,
dark
eyes
under
a
large,
square
forehead,
complexion
destitute
of
bloom
or
attraction;
something
young,
but
not
youthful,
no
object
to
win
a
lady's
love,
no
butt
for
the
shafts
of
Cupid.
I
was
soon
at
the
entrance
of
the
pensionnat,
in
a
moment
I
had
pulled
the
bell;
in
another
moment
the
door
was
opened,
and
within
appeared
a
passage
paved
alternately
with
black
and
white
marble;
the
walls
were
painted
in
imitation
of
marble
also;
and
at
the
far
end
opened
a
glass
door,
through
which
I
saw
shrubs
and
a
grass
plat,
looking
pleasant
in
the
sunshine
of
the
mild
spring
evening
for
it
was
now
the
middle
of
April.
This,
then,
was
my
first
glimpse
of
the
garden;
but
I
had
not
time
to
look
long,
the
portress,
after
having
answered
in
the
affirmative
my
question
as
to
whether
her
mistress
was
at
home,
opened
the
folding
doors
of
a
room
to
the
left,
and
having
ushered
me
in,
closed
them
behind
me.
I
found
myself
in
a
salon
with
a
very
well
painted,
highly
varnished
floor;
chairs
and
sofas
covered
with
white
draperies,
a
green
porcelain
stove,
walls
hung
with
pictures
in
gilt
frames,
a
gilt
pendule
and
other
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece,
a
large
lustre
pendent
from
the
centre
of
the
ceiling,
mirrors,
consoles,
muslin
curtains,
and
a
handsome
centre
table
completed
the
inventory
of
furniture.
All
looked
extremely
clean
and
glittering,
but
the
general
effect
would
have
been
somewhat
chilling
had
not
a
second
large
pair
of
folding
doors,
standing
wide
open,
and
disclosing
another
and
smaller
salon,
more
snugly
furnished,
offered
some
relief
to
the
eye.
This
room
was
carpeted,
and
therein
was
a
piano,
a
couch,
a
chiffonniere
above
all,
it
contained
a
lofty
window
with
a
crimson
curtain,
which,
being
undrawn,
afforded
another
glimpse
of
the
garden,
through
the
large,
clear
panes,
round
which
some
leaves
of
ivy,
some
tendrils
of
vine
were
trained.
"Monsieur
Creemsvort,
n'est
ce
pas?"
said
a
voice
behind
me;
and,
starting
involuntarily,
I
turned.
I
had
been
so
taken
up
with
the
contemplation
of
the
pretty
little
salon
that
I
had
not
noticed
the
entrance
of
a
person
into
the
larger
room.
It
was,
however,
Mdlle.
Reuter
who
now
addressed
me,
and
stood
close
beside
me;
and
when
I
had
bowed
with
instantaneously
recovered
sang
froid
for
I
am
not
easily
embarrassed
I
commenced
the
conversation
by
remarking
on
the
pleasant
aspect
of
her
little
cabinet,
and
the
advantage
she
had
over
M.
Pelet
in
possessing
a
garden.
"Yes,"
she
said,
"she
often
thought
so;"
and
added,
"it
is
my
garden,
monsieur,
which
makes
me
retain
this
house,
otherwise
I
should
probably
have
removed
to
larger
and
more
commodious
premises
long
since;
but
you
see
I
could
not
take
my
garden
with
me,
and
I
should
scarcely
find
one
so
large
and
pleasant
anywhere
else
in
town."
I
approved
her
judgment.
"But
you
have
not
seen
it
yet,"
said
she,
rising;
"come
to
the
window
and
take
a
better
view."
I
followed
her;
she
opened
the
sash,
and
leaning
out
I
saw
in
full
the
enclosed
demesne
which
had
hitherto
been
to
me
an
unknown
region.
It
was
a
long,
not
very
broad
strip
of
cultured
ground,
with
an
alley
bordered
by
enormous
old
fruit
trees
down
the
middle;
there
was
a
sort
of
lawn,
a
parterre
of
rose
trees,
some
flower
borders,
and,
on
the
far
side,
a
thickly
planted
copse
of
lilacs,
laburnums,
and
acacias.
It
looked
pleasant,
to
me
very
pleasant,
so
long
a
time
had
elapsed
since
I
had
seen
a
garden
of
any
sort.
But
it
was
not
only
on
Mdlle.
Reuter's
garden
that
my
eyes
dwelt;
when
I
had
taken
a
view
of
her
well
trimmed
beds
and
budding
shrubberies,
I
allowed
my
glance
to
come
back
to
herself,
nor
did
I
hastily
withdraw
it.
I
had
thought
to
see
a
tall,
meagre,
yellow,
conventual
image
in
black,
with
a
close
white
cap,
bandaged
under
the
chin
like
a
nun's
head
gear;
whereas,
there
stood
by
me
a
little
and
roundly
formed
woman,
who
might
indeed
be
older
than
I,
but
was
still
young;
she
could
not,
I
thought,
be
more
than
six
or
seven
and
twenty;
she
was
as
fair
as
a
fair
Englishwoman;
she
had
no
cap;
her
hair
was
nut
brown,
and
she
wore
it
in
curls;
pretty
her
features
were
not,
nor
very
soft,
nor
very
regular,
but
neither
were
they
in
any
degree
plain,
and
I
already
saw
cause
to
deem
them
expressive.
What
was
their
predominant
cast?
Was
it
sagacity?
sense?
Yes,
I
thought
so;
but
I
could
scarcely
as
yet
be
sure.
I
discovered,
however,
that
there
was
a
certain
serenity
of
eye,
and
freshness
of
complexion,
most
pleasing
to
behold.
The
colour
on
her
cheek
was
like
the
bloom
on
a
good
apple,
which
is
as
sound
at
the
core
as
it
is
red
on
the
rind.
Mdlle.
Reuter
and
I
entered
upon
business.
She
said
she
was
not
absolutely
certain
of
the
wisdom
of
the
step
she
was
about
to
take,
because
I
was
so
young,
and
parents
might
possibly
object
to
a
professor
like
me
for
their
daughters:
"But
it
is
often
well
to
act
on
one's
own
judgment,"
said
she,
"and
to
lead
parents,
rather
than
be
led
by
them.
The
fitness
of
a
professor
is
not
a
matter
of
age;
and,
from
what
I
have
heard,
and
from
what
I
observe
myself,
I
would
much
rather
trust
you
than
M.
Ledru,
the
music
master,
who
is
a
married
man
of
near
fifty."
I
remarked
that
I
hoped
she
would
find
me
worthy
of
her
good
opinion;
that
if
I
knew
myself,
I
was
incapable
of
betraying
any
confidence
reposed
in
me.
"Du
reste,"
said
she,
"the
surveillance
will
be
strictly
attended
to."
And
then
she
proceeded
to
discuss
the
subject
of
terms.
She
was
very
cautious,
quite
on
her
guard;
she
did
not
absolutely
bargain,
but
she
warily
sounded
me
to
find
out
what
my
expectations
might
be;
and
when
she
could
not
get
me
to
name
a
sum,
she
reasoned
and
reasoned
with
a
fluent
yet
quiet
circumlocution
of
speech,
and
at
last
nailed
me
down
to
five
hundred
francs
per
annum
not
too
much,
but
I
agreed.
Before
the
negotiation
was
completed,
it
began
to
grow
a
little
dusk.
I
did
not
hasten
it,
for
I
liked
well
enough
to
sit
and
hear
her
talk;
I
was
amused
with
the
sort
of
business
talent
she
displayed.
Edward
could
not
have
shown
himself
more
practical,
though
he
might
have
evinced
more
coarseness
and
urgency;
and
then
she
had
so
many
reasons,
so
many
explanations;
and,
after
all,
she
succeeded
in
proving
herself
quite
disinterested
and
even
liberal.
At
last
she
concluded,
she
could
say
no
more,
because,
as
I
acquiesced
in
all
things,
there
was
no
further
ground
for
the
exercise
of
her
parts
of
speech.
I
was
obliged
to
rise.
I
would
rather
have
sat
a
little
longer;
what
had
I
to
return
to
but
my
small
empty
room?
And
my
eyes
had
a
pleasure
in
looking
at
Mdlle.
Reuter,
especially
now,
when
the
twilight
softened
her
features
a
little,
and,
in
the
doubtful
dusk,
I
could
fancy
her
forehead
as
open
as
it
was
really
elevated,
her
mouth
touched
with
turns
of
sweetness
as
well
as
defined
in
lines
of
sense.
When
I
rose
to
go,
I
held
out
my
hand,
on
purpose,
though
I
knew
it
was
contrary
to
the
etiquette
of
foreign
habits;
she
smiled,
and
said
"Ah!
c'est
comme
tous
les
Anglais,"
but
gave
me
her
hand
very
kindly.
"It
is
the
privilege
of
my
country,
Mademoiselle,"
said
I;
"and,
remember,
I
shall
always
claim
it."
She
laughed
a
little,
quite
good
naturedly,
and
with
the
sort
of
tranquillity
obvious
in
all
she
did
a
tranquillity
which
soothed
and
suited
me
singularly,
at
least
I
thought
so
that
evening.
Brussels
seemed
a
very
pleasant
place
to
me
when
I
got
out
again
into
the
street,
and
it
appeared
as
if
some
cheerful,
eventful,
upward
tending
career
were
even
then
opening
to
me,
on
that
selfsame
mild,
still
April
night.
So
impressionable
a
being
is
man,
or
at
least
such
a
man
as
I
was
in
those
days.
NEXT
day
the
morning
hours
seemed
to
pass
very
slowly
at
M.
Pelet's;
I
wanted
the
afternoon
to
come
that
I
might
go
again
to
the
neighbouring
pensionnat
and
give
my
first
lesson
within
its
pleasant
precincts;
for
pleasant
they
appeared
to
me.
At
noon
the
hour
of
recreation
arrived;
at
one
o'clock
we
had
lunch;
this
got
on
the
time,
and
at
last
St.
Gudule's
deep
bell,
tolling
slowly
two,
marked
the
moment
for
which
I
had
been
waiting.
At
the
foot
of
the
narrow
back
stairs
that
descended
from
my
room,
I
met
M.
Pelet.
"Comme
vous
avez
l'air
rayonnant!"
said
he.
"Je
ne
vous
ai
jamais
vu
aussi
gai.
Que
s'est
il
donc
passe?"
"Apparemment
que
j'aime
les
changements,"
replied
I.
"Ah!
je
comprends
c'est
cela
soyez
sage
seulement.
Vous
etes
bien
jeune
trop
jeune
pour
le
role
que
vous
allez
jouer;
il
faut
prendre
garde
savez
vous?"
"Mais
quel
danger
y
a
t
il?"
"Je
n'en
sais
rien
ne
vous
laissez
pas
aller
a
de
vives
impressions
voila
tout."
I
laughed:
a
sentiment
of
exquisite
pleasure
played
over
my
nerves
at
the
thought
that
"vives
impressions"
were
likely
to
be
created;
it
was
the
deadness,
the
sameness
of
life's
daily
ongoings
that
had
hitherto
been
my
bane;
my
blouse
clad
"eleves"
in
the
boys'
seminary
never
stirred
in
me
any
"vives
impressions"
except
it
might
be
occasionally
some
of
anger.
I
broke
from
M.
Pelet,
and
as
I
strode
down
the
passage
he
followed
me
with
one
of
his
laughs
a
very
French,
rakish,
mocking
sound.
Again
I
stood
at
the
neighbouring
door,
and
soon
was
re
admitted
into
the
cheerful
passage
with
its
clear
dove
colour
imitation
marble
walls.
I
followed
the
portress,
and
descending
a
step,
and
making
a
turn,
I
found
myself
in
a
sort
of
corridor;
a
side
door
opened,
Mdlle.
Reuter's
little
figure,
as
graceful
as
it
was
plump,
appeared.
I
could
now
see
her
dress
in
full
daylight;
a
neat,
simple
mousseline
laine
gown
fitted
her
compact
round
shape
to
perfection
delicate
little
collar
and
manchettes
of
lace,
trim
Parisian
brodequins
showed
her
neck,
wrists,
and
feet,
to
complete
advantage;
but
how
grave
was
her
face
as
she
came
suddenly
upon
me!
Solicitude
and
business
were
in
her
eye
on
her
forehead;
she
looked
almost
stern.
Her
"Bon
jour,
monsieur,"
was
quite
polite,
but
so
orderly,
so
commonplace,
it
spread
directly
a
cool,
damp
towel
over
my
"vives
impressions."
The
servant
turned
back
when
her
mistress
appeared,
and
I
walked
slowly
along
the
corridor,
side
by
side
with
Mdlle.
Reuter.
"Monsieur
will
give
a
lesson
in
the
first
class
to
day,"
said
she;
"dictation
or
reading
will
perhaps
be
the
best
thing
to
begin
with,
for
those
are
the
easiest
forms
of
communicating
instruction
in
a
foreign
language;
and,
at
the
first,
a
master
naturally
feels
a
little
unsettled."
She
was
quite
right,
as
I
had
found
from
experience;
it
only
remained
for
me
to
acquiesce.
We
proceeded
now
in
silence.
The
corridor
terminated
in
a
hall,
large,
lofty,
and
square;
a
glass
door
on
one
side
showed
within
a
long
narrow
refectory,
with
tables,
an
armoire,
and
two
lamps;
it
was
empty;
large
glass
doors,
in
front,
opened
on
the
playground
and
garden;
a
broad
staircase
ascended
spirally
on
the
opposite
side;
the
remaining
wall
showed
a
pair
of
great
folding
doors,
now
closed,
and
admitting,
doubtless,
to
the
classes.
Mdlle.
Reuter
turned
her
eye
laterally
on
me,
to
ascertain,
probably,
whether
I
was
collected
enough
to
be
ushered
into
her
sanctum
sanctorum.
I
suppose
she
judged
me
to
be
in
a
tolerable
state
of
self
government,
for
she
opened
the
door,
and
I
followed
her
through.
A
rustling
sound
of
uprising
greeted
our
entrance;
without
looking
to
the
right
or
left,
I
walked
straight
up
the
lane
between
two
sets
of
benches
and
desks,
and
took
possession
of
the
empty
chair
and
isolated
desk
raised
on
an
estrade,
of
one
step
high,
so
as
to
command
one
division;
the
other
division
being
under
the
surveillance
of
a
maitresse
similarly
elevated.
At
the
back
of
the
estrade,
and
attached
to
a
moveable
partition
dividing
this
schoolroom
from
another
beyond,
was
a
large
tableau
of
wood
painted
black
and
varnished;
a
thick
crayon
of
white
chalk
lay
on
my
desk
for
the
convenience
of
elucidating
any
grammatical
or
verbal
obscurity
which
might
occur
in
my
lessons
by
writing
it
upon
the
tableau;
a
wet
sponge
appeared
beside
the
chalk,
to
enable
me
to
efface
the
marks
when
they
had
served
the
purpose
intended.
I
carefully
and
deliberately
made
these
observations
before
allowing
myself
to
take
one
glance
at
the
benches
before
me;
having
handled
the
crayon,
looked
back
at
the
tableau,
fingered
the
sponge
in
order
to
ascertain
that
it
was
in
a
right
state
of
moisture,
I
found
myself
cool
enough
to
admit
of
looking
calmly
up
and
gazing
deliberately
round
me.
And
first
I
observed
that
Mdlle.
Reuter
had
already
glided
away,
she
was
nowhere
visible;
a
maitresse
or
teacher,
the
one
who
occupied
the
corresponding
estrade
to
my
own,
alone
remained
to
keep
guard
over
me;
she
was
a
little
in
the
shade,
and,
with
my
short
sight,
I
could
only
see
that
she
was
of
a
thin
bony
figure
and
rather
tallowy
complexion,
and
that
her
attitude,
as
she
sat,
partook
equally
of
listlessness
and
affectation.
More
obvious,
more
prominent,
shone
on
by
the
full
light
of
the
large
window,
were
the
occupants
of
the
benches
just
before
me,
of
whom
some
were
girls
of
fourteen,
fifteen,
sixteen,
some
young
women
from
eighteen
(as
it
appeared
to
me)
up
to
twenty;
the
most
modest
attire,
the
simplest
fashion
of
wearing
the
hair,
were
apparent
in
all;
and
good
features,
ruddy,
blooming
complexions,
large
and
brilliant
eyes,
forms
full,
even
to
solidity,
seemed
to
abound.
I
did
not
bear
the
first
view
like
a
stoic;
I
was
dazzled,
my
eyes
fell,
and
in
a
voice
somewhat
too
low
I
murmured
"Prenez
vos
cahiers
de
dictee,
mesdemoiselles."
Not
so
had
I
bid
the
boys
at
Pelet's
take
their
reading
books.
A
rustle
followed,
and
an
opening
of
desks;
behind
the
lifted
lids
which
momentarily
screened
the
heads
bent
down
to
search
for
exercise
books,
I
heard
tittering
and
whispers.
"Eulalie,
je
suis
prete
a
pleuer
de
rire,"
observed
one.
"Comme
il
a
rougi
en
parlant!"
"Oui,
c'est
un
veritable
blanc
bec."
"Tais
toi,
Hortense
il
nous
ecoute."
And
now
the
lids
sank
and
the
heads
reappeared;
I
had
marked
three,
the
whisperers,
and
I
did
not
scruple
to
take
a
very
steady
look
at
them
as
they
emerged
from
their
temporary
eclipse.
It
is
astonishing
what
ease
and
courage
their
little
phrases
of
flippancy
had
given
me;
the
idea
by
which
I
had
been
awed
was
that
the
youthful
beings
before
me,
with
their
dark
nun
like
robes
and
softly
braided
hair,
were
a
kind
of
half
angels.
The
light
titter,
the
giddy
whisper,
had
already
in
some
measure
relieved
my
mind
of
that
fond
and
oppressive
fancy.
The
three
I
allude
to
were
just
in
front,
within
half
a
yard
of
my
estrade,
and
were
among
the
most
womanly
looking
present.
Their
names
I
knew
afterwards,
and
may
as
well
mention
now;
they
were
Eulalie,
Hortense,
Caroline.
Eulalie
was
tall,
and
very
finely
shaped:
she
was
fair,
and
her
features
were
those
of
a
Low
Country
Madonna;
many
a
"figure
de
Vierge"
have
I
seen
in
Dutch
pictures
exactly
resembling
hers;
there
were
no
angles
in
her
shape
or
in
her
face,
all
was
curve
and
roundness
neither
thought,
sentiment,
nor
passion
disturbed
by
line
or
flush
the
equality
of
her
pale,
clear
skin;
her
noble
bust
heaved
with
her
regular
breathing,
her
eyes
moved
a
little
by
these
evidences
of
life
alone
could
I
have
distinguished
her
from
some
large
handsome
figure
moulded
in
wax.
Hortense
was
of
middle
size
and
stout,
her
form
was
ungraceful,
her
face
striking,
more
alive
and
brilliant
than
Eulalie's,
her
hair
was
dark
brown,
her
complexion
richly
coloured;
there
were
frolic
and
mischief
in
her
eye:
consistency
and
good
sense
she
might
possess,
but
none
of
her
features
betokened
those
qualities.
Caroline
was
little,
though
evidently
full
grown;
raven
black
hair,
very
dark
eyes,
absolutely
regular
features,
with
a
colourless
olive
complexion,
clear
as
to
the
face
and
sallow
about
the
neck,
formed
in
her
that
assemblage
of
points
whose
union
many
persons
regard
as
the
perfection
of
beauty.
How,
with
the
tintless
pallor
of
her
skin
and
the
classic
straightness
of
her
lineaments,
she
managed
to
look
sensual,
I
don't
know.
I
think
her
lips
and
eyes
contrived
the
affair
between
them,
and
the
result
left
no
uncertainty
on
the
beholder's
mind.
She
was
sensual
now,
and
in
ten
years'
time
she
would
be
coarse
promise
plain
was
written
in
her
face
of
much
future
folly.
If
I
looked
at
these
girls
with
little
scruple,
they
looked
at
me
with
still
less.
Eulalie
raised
her
unmoved
eye
to
mine,
and
seemed
to
expect,
passively
but
securely,
an
impromptu
tribute
to
her
majestic
charms.
Hortense
regarded
me
boldly,
and
giggled
at
the
same
time,
while
she
said,
with
an
air
of
impudent
freedom
"Dictez
nous
quelquechose
de
facile
pour
commencer,
monsieur."
Caroline
shook
her
loose
ringlets
of
abundant
but
somewhat
coarse
hair
over
her
rolling
black
eyes;
parting
her
lips,
as
full
as
those
of
a
hot
blooded
Maroon,
she
showed
her
well
set
teeth
sparkling
between
them,
and
treated
me
at
the
same
time
to
a
smile
"de
sa
facon."
Beautiful
as
Pauline
Borghese,
she
looked
at
the
moment
scarcely
purer
than
Lucrece
de
Borgia.
Caroline
was
of
noble
family.
I
heard
her
lady
mother's
character
afterwards,
and
then
I
ceased
to
wonder
at
the
precocious
accomplishments
of
the
daughter.
These
three,
I
at
once
saw,
deemed
themselves
the
queens
of
the
school,
and
conceived
that
by
their
splendour
they
threw
all
the
rest
into
the
shade.
In
less
than
five
minutes
they
had
thus
revealed
to
me
their
characters,
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
I
had
buckled
on
a
breast
plate
of
steely
indifference,
and
let
down
a
visor
of
impassible
austerity.
"Take
your
pens
and
commence
writing,"
said
I,
in
as
dry
and
trite
a
voice
as
if
I
had
been
addressing
only
Jules
Vanderkelkov
and
Co.
The
dictee
now
commenced.
My
three
belles
interrupted
me
perpetually
with
little
silly
questions
and
uncalled
for
remarks,
to
some
of
which
I
made
no
answer,
and
to
others
replied
very
quietly
and
briefly.
"Comment
dit
on
point
et
virgule
en
Anglais,
monsieur?"
"Semi
colon,
mademoiselle."
"Semi
collong?
Ah,
comme
c'est
drole!"
(giggle.)
"J'ai
une
si
mauvaise
plume
impossible
d'ecrire!"
"Mais,
monsieur
je
ne
sais
pas
suivre
vous
allez
si
vite."
"Je
n'ai
rien
compris,
moi!"
Here
a
general
murmur
arose,
and
the
teacher,
opening
her
lips
for
the
first
time,
ejaculated
"Silence,
mesdemoiselles!"
No
silence
followed
on
the
contrary,
the
three
ladies
in
front
began
to
talk
more
loudly.
"C'est
si
difficile,
l'Anglais!"
"Je
deteste
la
dictee."
"Quel
ennui
d'ecrire
quelquechose
que
l'on
ne
comprend
pas!"
Some
of
those
behind
laughed:
a
degree
of
confusion
began
to
pervade
the
class;
it
was
necessary
to
take
prompt
measures.
"Donnez
moi
votre
cahier,"
said
I
to
Eulalie
in
an
abrupt
tone;
and
bending
over,
I
took
it
before
she
had
time
to
give
it.
"Et
vous,
mademoiselle
donnez
moi
le
votre,"
continued
I,
more
mildly,
addressing
a
little
pale,
plain
looking
girl
who
sat
in
the
first
row
of
the
other
division,
and
whom
I
had
remarked
as
being
at
once
the
ugliest
and
the
most
attentive
in
the
room;
she
rose
up,
walked
over
to
me,
and
delivered
her
book
with
a
grave,
modest
curtsey.
I
glanced
over
the
two
dictations;
Eulalie's
was
slurred,
blotted,
and
full
of
silly
mistakes
Sylvie's
(such
was
the
name
of
the
ugly
little
girl)
was
clearly
written,
it
contained
no
error
against
sense,
and
but
few
faults
of
orthography.
I
coolly
read
aloud
both
exercises,
marking
the
faults
then
I
looked
at
Eulalie:
"C'est
honteux!"
said
I,
and
I
deliberately
tore
her
dictation
in
four
parts,
and
presented
her
with
the
fragments.
I
returned
Sylvie
her
book
with
a
smile,
saying
"C'est
bien
je
suis
content
de
vous."
Sylvie
looked
calmly
pleased,
Eulalie
swelled
like
an
incensed
turkey,
but
the
mutiny
was
quelled:
the
conceited
coquetry
and
futile
flirtation
of
the
first
bench
were
exchanged
for
a
taciturn
sullenness,
much
more
convenient
to
me,
and
the
rest
of
my
lesson
passed
without
interruption.
A
bell
clanging
out
in
the
yard
announced
the
moment
for
the
cessation
of
school
labours.
I
heard
our
own
bell
at
the
same
time,
and
that
of
a
certain
public
college
immediately
after.
Order
dissolved
instantly;
up
started
every
pupil,
I
hastened
to
seize
my
hat,
bow
to
the
maitresse,
and
quit
the
room
before
the
tide
of
externats
should
pour
from
the
inner
class,
where
I
knew
near
a
hundred
were
prisoned,
and
whose
rising
tumult
I
already
heard.
I
had
scarcely
crossed
the
hall
and
gained
the
corridor,
when
Mdlle.
Reuter
came
again
upon
me.
"Step
in
here
a
moment,"
said
she,
and
she
held
open
the
door
of
the
side
room
from
whence
she
had
issued
on
my
arrival;
it
was
a
SALLE
A
MANGER,
as
appeared
from
the
beaufet
and
the
armoire
vitree,
filled
with
glass
and
china,
which
formed
part
of
its
furniture.
Ere
she
had
closed
the
door
on
me
and
herself,
the
corridor
was
already
filled
with
day
pupils,
tearing
down
their
cloaks,
bonnets,
and
cabas
from
the
wooden
pegs
on
which
they
were
suspended;
the
shrill
voice
of
a
maitresse
was
heard
at
intervals
vainly
endeavouring
to
enforce
some
sort
of
order;
vainly,
I
say:
discipline
there
was
none
in
these
rough
ranks,
and
yet
this
was
considered
one
of
the
best
conducted
schools
in
Brussels.
"Well,
you
have
given
your
first
lesson,"
began
Mdlle.
Reuter
in
the
most
calm,
equable
voice,
as
though
quite
unconscious
of
the
chaos
from
which
we
were
separated
only
by
a
single
wall.
"Were
you
satisfied
with
your
pupils,
or
did
any
circumstance
in
their
conduct
give
you
cause
for
complaint?
Conceal
nothing
from
me,
repose
in
me
entire
confidence."
Happily,
I
felt
in
myself
complete
power
to
manage
my
pupils
without
aid;
the
enchantment,
the
golden
haze
which
had
dazzled
my
perspicuity
at
first,
had
been
a
good
deal
dissipated.
I
cannot
say
I
was
chagrined
or
downcast
by
the
contrast
which
the
reality
of
a
pensionnat
de
demoiselles
presented
to
my
vague
ideal
of
the
same
community;
I
was
only
enlightened
and
amused;
consequently,
I
felt
in
no
disposition
to
complain
to
Mdlle.
Reuter,
and
I
received
her
considerate
invitation
to
confidence
with
a
smile.
"A
thousand
thanks,
mademoiselle,
all
has
gone
very
smoothly."
She
looked
more
than
doubtful.
"Et
les
trois
demoiselles
du
premier
banc?"
said
she.
"Ah!
tout
va
au
mieux!"
was
my
answer,
and
Mdlle.
Reuter
ceased
to
question
me;
but
her
eye
not
large,
not
brilliant,
not
melting,
or
kindling,
but
astute,
penetrating,
practical,
showed
she
was
even
with
me;
it
let
out
a
momentary
gleam,
which
said
plainly,
"Be
as
close
as
you
like,
I
am
not
dependent
on
your
candour;
what
you
would
conceal
I
already
know."
By
a
transition
so
quiet
as
to
be
scarcely
perceptible,
the
directress's
manner
changed;
the
anxious
business
air
passed
from
her
face,
and
she
began
chatting
about
the
weather
and
the
town,
and
asking
in
neighbourly
wise
after
M.
and
Madame
Pelet.
I
answered
all
her
little
questions;
she
prolonged
her
talk,
I
went
on
following
its
many
little
windings;
she
sat
so
long,
said
so
much,
varied
so
often
the
topics
of
discourse,
that
it
was
not
difficult
to
perceive
she
had
a
particular
aim
in
thus
detaining
me.
Her
mere
words
could
have
afforded
no
clue
to
this
aim,
but
her
countenance
aided;
while
her
lips
uttered
only
affable
commonplaces,
her
eyes
reverted
continually
to
my
face.
Her
glances
were
not
given
in
full,
but
out
of
the
corners,
so
quietly,
so
stealthily,
yet
I
think
I
lost
not
one.
I
watched
her
as
keenly
as
she
watched
me;
I
perceived
soon
that
she
was
feeling
after
my
real
character;
she
was
searching
for
salient
points,
and
weak
points,
and
eccentric
points;
she
was
applying
now
this
test,
now
that,
hoping
in
the
end
to
find
some
chink,
some
niche,
where
she
could
put
in
her
little
firm
foot
and
stand
upon
my
neck
mistress
of
my
nature.
Do
not
mistake
me,
reader,
it
was
no
amorous
influence
she
wished
to
gain
at
that
time
it
was
only
the
power
of
the
politician
to
which
she
aspired;
I
was
now
installed
as
a
professor
in
her
establishment,
and
she
wanted
to
know
where
her
mind
was
superior
to
mine
by
what
feeling
or
opinion
she
could
lead
me.
I
enjoyed
the
game
much,
and
did
not
hasten
its
conclusion;
sometimes
I
gave
her
hopes,
beginning
a
sentence
rather
weakly,
when
her
shrewd
eye
would
light
up
she
thought
she
had
me;
having
led
her
a
little
way,
I
delighted
to
turn
round
and
finish
with
sound,
hard
sense,
whereat
her
countenance
would
fall.
At
last
a
servant
entered
to
announce
dinner;
the
conflict
being
thus
necessarily
terminated,
we
parted
without
having
gained
any
advantage
on
either
side:
Mdlle.
Reuter
had
not
even
given
me
an
opportunity
of
attacking
her
with
feeling,
and
I
had
managed
to
baffle
her
little
schemes
of
craft.
It
was
a
regular
drawn
battle.
I
again
held
out
my
hand
when
I
left
the
room,
she
gave
me
hers;
it
was
a
small
and
white
hand,
but
how
cool!
I
met
her
eye
too
in
full
obliging
her
to
give
me
a
straightforward
look;
this
last
test
went
against
me:
it
left
her
as
it
found
her
moderate,
temperate,
tranquil;
me
it
disappointed.
"I
am
growing
wiser,"
thought
I,
as
I
walked
back
to
M.
Pelet's.
"Look
at
this
little
woman;
is
she
like
the
women
of
novelists
and
romancers?
To
read
of
female
character
as
depicted
in
Poetry
and
Fiction,
one
would
think
it
was
made
up
of
sentiment,
either
for
good
or
bad
here
is
a
specimen,
and
a
most
sensible
and
respectable
specimen,
too,
whose
staple
ingredient
is
abstract
reason.
No
Talleyrand
was
ever
more
passionless
than
Zoraide
Reuter!"
So
I
thought
then;
I
found
afterwards
that
blunt
susceptibilities
are
very
consistent
with
strong
propensities.
I
HAD
indeed
had
a
very
long
talk
with
the
crafty
little
politician,
and
on
regaining
my
quarters,
I
found
that
dinner
was
half
over.
To
be
late
at
meals
was
against
a
standing
rule
of
the
establishment,
and
had
it
been
one
of
the
Flemish
ushers
who
thus
entered
after
the
removal
of
the
soup
and
the
commencement
of
the
first
course,
M.
Pelet
would
probably
have
greeted
him
with
a
public
rebuke,
and
would
certainly
have
mulcted
him
both
of
soup
and
fish;
as
it
was,
that
polite
though
partial
gentleman
only
shook
his
head,
and
as
I
took
my
place,
unrolled
my
napkin,
and
said
my
heretical
grace
to
myself,
he
civilly
despatched
a
servant
to
the
kitchen,
to
bring
me
a
plate
of
"puree
aux
carottes"
(for
this
was
a
maigre
day),
and
before
sending
away
the
first
course,
reserved
for
me
a
portion
of
the
stock
fish
of
which
it
consisted.
Dinner
being
over,
the
boys
rushed
out
for
their
evening
play;
Kint
and
Vandam
(the
two
ushers)
of
course
followed
them.
Poor
fellows!
if
they
had
not
looked
so
very
heavy,
so
very
soulless,
so
very
indifferent
to
all
things
in
heaven
above
or
in
the
earth
beneath,
I
could
have
pitied
them
greatly
for
the
obligation
they
were
under
to
trail
after
those
rough
lads
everywhere
and
at
all
times;
even
as
it
was,
I
felt
disposed
to
scout
myself
as
a
privileged
prig
when
I
turned
to
ascend
to
my
chamber,
sure
to
find
there,
if
not
enjoyment,
at
least
liberty;
but
this
evening
(as
had
often
happened
before)
I
was
to
be
still
farther
distinguished.
"Eh
bien,
mauvais
sujet!"
said
the
voice
of
M.
Pelet
behind
me,
as
I
set
my
foot
on
the
first
step
of
the
stair,
"ou
allez
vous?
Venez
a
la
salle
a
manger,
que
je
vous
gronde
un
peu."
"I
beg
pardon,
monsieur,"
said
I,
as
I
followed
him
to
his
private
sitting
room,
"for
having
returned
so
late
it
was
not
my
fault."
"That
is
just
what
I
want
to
know,"
rejoined
M.
Pelet,
as
he
ushered
me
into
the
comfortable
parlour
with
a
good
wood
fire
for
the
stove
had
now
been
removed
for
the
season.
Having
rung
the
bell
he
ordered
"Coffee
for
two,"
and
presently
he
and
I
were
seated,
almost
in
English
comfort,
one
on
each
side
of
the
hearth,
a
little
round
table
between
us,
with
a
coffee
pot,
a
sugar
basin,
and
two
large
white
china
cups.
While
M.
Pelet
employed
himself
in
choosing
a
cigar
from
a
box,
my
thoughts
reverted
to
the
two
outcast
ushers,
whose
voices
I
could
hear
even
now
crying
hoarsely
for
order
in
the
playground.
"C'est
une
grande
responsabilite,
que
la
surveillance,"
observed
I.
"Plait
il?"
dit
M.
Pelet.
I
remarked
that
I
thought
Messieurs
Vandam
and
Kint
must
sometimes
be
a
little
fatigued
with
their
labours.
"Des
betes
de
somme,
des
betes
de
somme,"
murmured
scornfully
the
director.
Meantime
I
offered
him
his
cup
of
coffee.
"Servez
vous
mon
garcon,"
said
he
blandly,
when
I
had
put
a
couple
of
huge
lumps
of
continental
sugar
into
his
cup.
"And
now
tell
me
why
you
stayed
so
long
at
Mdlle.
Reuter's.
I
know
that
lessons
conclude,
in
her
establishment
as
in
mine,
at
four
o'clock,
and
when
you
returned
it
was
past
five."
"Mdlle.
wished
to
speak
with
me,
monsieur."
"Indeed!
on
what
subject?
if
one
may
ask."
"Mademoiselle
talked
about
nothing,
monsieur."
"A
fertile
topic!
and
did
she
discourse
thereon
in
the
schoolroom,
before
the
pupils?"
"No;
like
you,
monsieur,
she
asked
me
to
walk
into
her
parlour."
"And
Madame
Reuter
the
old
duenna
my
mother's
gossip,
was
there,
of
course?"
"No,
monsieur;
I
had
the
honour
of
being
quite
alone
with
mademoiselle."
"C'est
joli
cela,"
observed
M.
Pelet,
and
he
smiled
and
looked
into
the
fire.
"Honi
soit
qui
mal
y
pense,"
murmured
I,
significantly.
"Je
connais
un
peu
ma
petite
voisine
voyez
vous."
"In
that
case,
monsieur
will
be
able
to
aid
me
in
finding
out
what
was
mademoiselle's
reason
for
making
me
sit
before
her
sofa
one
mortal
hour,
listening
to
the
most
copious
and
fluent
dissertation
on
the
merest
frivolities."
"She
was
sounding
your
character."
"I
thought
so,
monsieur."
"Did
she
find
out
your
weak
point?"
"What
is
my
weak
point?"
"Why,
the
sentimental.
Any
woman
sinking
her
shaft
deep
enough,
will
at
last
reach
a
fathomless
spring
of
sensibility
in
thy
breast,
Crimsworth."
I
felt
the
blood
stir
about
my
heart
and
rise
warm
to
my
cheek.
"Some
women
might,
monsieur."
"Is
Mdlle.
Reuter
of
the
number?
Come,
speak
frankly,
mon
fils;
elle
est
encore
jeune,
plus
agee
que
toi
peut
etre,
mais
juste
assey
pour
unir
la
tendresse
d'une
petite
maman
a
l'amour
d'une
epouse
devouee;
n'est
ce
pas
que
cela
t'irait
superieurement?"
"No,
monsieur;
I
should
like
my
wife
to
be
my
wife,
and
not
half
my
mother."
"She
is
then
a
little
too
old
for
you?"
"No,
monsieur,
not
a
day
too
old
if
she
suited
me
in
other
things."
"In
what
does
she
not
suit
you,
William?
She
is
personally
agreeable,
is
she
not?"
"Very;
her
hair
and
complexion
are
just
what
I
admire;
and
her
turn
of
form,
though
quite
Belgian,
is
full
of
grace."
"Bravo!
and
her
face?
her
features?
How
do
you
like
them?"
"A
little
harsh,
especially
her
mouth."
"Ah,
yes!
her
mouth,"
said
M.
Pelet,
and
he
chuckled
inwardly.
"There
is
character
about
her
mouth
firmness
but
she
has
a
very
pleasant
smile;
don't
you
think
so?"
"Rather
crafty."
"True,
but
that
expression
of
craft
is
owing
to
her
eyebrows;
have
you
remarked
her
eyebrows?"
I
answered
that
I
had
not.
"You
have
not
seen
her
looking
down
then?"
said
he.
"No."
"It
is
a
treat,
notwithstanding.
Observe
her
when
she
has
some
knitting,
or
some
other
woman's
work
in
hand,
and
sits
the
image
of
peace,
calmly
intent
on
her
needles
and
her
silk,
some
discussion
meantime
going
on
around
her,
in
the
course
of
which
peculiarities
of
character
are
being
developed,
or
important
interests
canvassed;
she
takes
no
part
in
it;
her
humble,
feminine
mind
is
wholly
with
her
knitting;
none
of
her
features
move;
she
neither
presumes
to
smile
approval,
nor
frown
disapprobation;
her
little
hands
assiduously
ply
their
unpretending
task;
if
she
can
only
get
this
purse
finished,
or
this
bonnet
grec
completed,
it
is
enough
for
her.
If
gentlemen
approach
her
chair,
a
deeper
quiescence,
a
meeker
modesty
settles
on
her
features,
and
clothes
her
general
mien;
observe
then
her
eyebrows,
et
dites
moi
s'il
n'y
a
pas
du
chat
dans
l'un
et
du
renard
dans
l'autre."
"I
will
take
careful
notice
the
first
opportunity,"
said
I.
"And
then,"
continued
M.
Pelet,
"the
eyelid
will
flicker,
the
light
coloured
lashes
be
lifted
a
second,
and
a
blue
eye,
glancing
out
from
under
the
screen,
will
take
its
brief,
sly,
searching
survey,
and
retreat
again."
I
smiled,
and
so
did
Pelet,
and
after
a
few
minutes'
silence,
I
asked:
"Will
she
ever
marry,
do
you
think?"
"Marry!
Will
birds
pair?
Of
course
it
is
both
her
intention
and
resolution
to
marry
when
she
finds
a
suitable
match,
and
no
one
is
better
aware
than
herself
of
the
sort
of
impression
she
is
capable
of
producing;
no
one
likes
better
to
captivate
in
a
quiet
way.
I
am
mistaken
if
she
will
not
yet
leave
the
print
of
her
stealing
steps
on
thy
heart,
Crimsworth."
"Of
her
steps?
Confound
it,
no!
My
heart
is
not
a
plank
to
be
walked
on."
"But
the
soft
touch
of
a
patte
de
velours
will
do
it
no
harm."
"She
offers
me
no
patte
de
velours;
she
is
all
form
and
reserve
with
me."
"That
to
begin
with;
let
respect
be
the
foundation,
affection
the
first
floor,
love
the
superstructure;
Mdlle.
Reuter
is
a
skilful
architect."
"And
interest,
M.
Pelet
interest.
Will
not
mademoiselle
consider
that
point?"
"Yes,
yes,
no
doubt;
it
will
be
the
cement
between
every
stone.
And
now
we
have
discussed
the
directress,
what
of
the
pupils?
N'y
a
t
il
pas
de
belles
etudes
parmi
ces
jeunes
tetes?"
"Studies
of
character?
Yes;
curious
ones,
at
least,
I
imagine;
but
one
cannot
divine
much
from
a
first
interview."
"Ah,
you
affect
discretion;
but
tell
me
now,
were
you
not
a
little
abashed
before
these
blooming
young
creatures?"
"At
first,
yes;
but
I
rallied
and
got
through
with
all
due
sang
froid."
"I
don't
believe
you."
"It
is
true,
notwithstanding.
At
first
I
thought
them
angels,
but
they
did
not
leave
me
long
under
that
delusion;
three
of
the
eldest
and
handsomest
undertook
the
task
of
setting
me
right,
and
they
managed
so
cleverly
that
in
five
minutes
I
knew
them,
at
least,
for
what
they
were
three
arrant
coquettes."
"Je
les
connais!"
exclaimed
M.
Pelet.
"Elles
sont
toujours
au
premier
rang
a
l'eglise
et
a
la
promenade;
une
blonde
superbe,
une
jolie
espiegle,
une
belle
brune."
"Exactly."
"Lovely
creatures
all
of
them
heads
for
artists;
what
a
group
they
would
make,
taken
together!
Eulalie
(I
know
their
names),
with
her
smooth
braided
hair
and
calm
ivory
brow.
Hortense,
with
her
rich
chesnut
locks
so
luxuriantly
knotted,
plaited,
twisted,
as
if
she
did
not
know
how
to
dispose
of
all
their
abundance,
with
her
vermilion
lips,
damask
cheek,
and
roguish
laughing
eye.
And
Caroline
de
Blemont!
Ah,
there
is
beauty!
beauty
in
perfection.
What
a
cloud
of
sable
curls
about
the
face
of
a
houri!
What
fascinating
lips!
What
glorious
black
eyes!
Your
Byron
would
have
worshipped
her,
and
you
you
cold,
frigid
islander!
you
played
the
austere,
the
insensible
in
the
presence
of
an
Aphrodite
so
exquisite?"
I
might
have
laughed
at
the
director's
enthusiasm
had
I
believed
it
real,
but
there
was
something
in
his
tone
which
indicated
got
up
raptures.
I
felt
he
was
only
affecting
fervour
in
order
to
put
me
off
my
guard,
to
induce
me
to
come
out
in
return,
so
I
scarcely
even
smiled.
He
went
on:
"Confess,
William,
do
not
the
mere
good
looks
of
Zoraide
Reuter
appear
dowdyish
and
commonplace
compared
with
the
splendid
charms
of
some
of
her
pupils?"
The
question
discomposed
me,
but
I
now
felt
plainly
that
my
principal
was
endeavouring
(for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
at
that
time
I
could
not
fathom
them)
to
excite
ideas
and
wishes
in
my
mind
alien
to
what
was
right
and
honourable.
The
iniquity
of
the
instigation
proved
its
antidote,
and
when
he
further
added:
"Each
of
those
three
beautiful
girls
will
have
a
handsome
fortune;
and
with
a
little
address,
a
gentlemanlike,
intelligent
young
fellow
like
you
might
make
himself
master
of
the
hand,
heart,
and
purse
of
any
one
of
the
trio."
I
replied
by
a
look
and
an
interrogative
"Monsieur?"
which
startled
him.
He
laughed
a
forced
laugh,
affirmed
that
he
had
only
been
joking,
and
demanded
whether
I
could
possibly
have
thought
him
in
earnest.
Just
then
the
bell
rang;
the
play
hour
was
over;
it
was
an
evening
on
which
M.
Pelet
was
accustomed
to
read
passages
from
the
drama
and
the
belles
lettres
to
his
pupils.
He
did
not
wait
for
my
answer,
but
rising,
left
the
room,
humming
as
he
went
some
gay
strain
of
Beranger's.
DAILY,
as
I
continued
my
attendance
at
the
seminary
of
Mdlle.
Reuter,
did
I
find
fresh
occasions
to
compare
the
ideal
with
the
real.
What
had
I
known
of
female
character
previously
to
my
arrival
at
Brussels?
Precious
little.
And
what
was
my
notion
of
it?
Something
vague,
slight,
gauzy,
glittering;
now
when
I
came
in
contact
with
it
I
found
it
to
be
a
palpable
substance
enough;
very
hard
too
sometimes,
and
often
heavy;
there
was
metal
in
it,
both
lead
and
iron.
Let
the
idealists,
the
dreamers
about
earthly
angel
and
human
flowers,
just
look
here
while
I
open
my
portfolio
and
show
them
a
sketch
or
two,
pencilled
after
nature.
I
took
these
sketches
in
the
second
class
schoolroom
of
Mdlle.
Reuter's
establishment,
where
about
a
hundred
specimens
of
the
genus
"jeune
fille"
collected
together
offered
a
fertile
variety
of
subject.
A
miscellaneous
assortment
they
were,
differing
both
in
caste
and
country;
as
I
sat
on
my
estrade
and
glanced
over
the
long
range
of
desks,
I
had
under
my
eye
French,
English,
Belgians,
Austrians,
and
Prussians.
The
majority
belonged
to
the
class
bourgeois;
but
there
were
many
countesses,
there
were
the
daughters
of
two
generals
and
of
several
colonels,
captains,
and
government
EMPLOYES;
these
ladies
sat
side
by
side
with
young
females
destined
to
be
demoiselles
de
magasins,
and
with
some
Flamandes,
genuine
aborigines
of
the
country.
In
dress
all
were
nearly
similar,
and
in
manners
there
was
small
difference;
exceptions
there
were
to
the
general
rule,
but
the
majority
gave
the
tone
to
the
establishment,
and
that
tone
was
rough,
boisterous,
masked
by
a
point
blank
disregard
of
all
forbearance
towards
each
other
or
their
teachers;
an
eager
pursuit
by
each
individual
of
her
own
interest
and
convenience;
and
a
coarse
indifference
to
the
interest
and
convenience
of
every
one
else.
Most
of
them
could
lie
with
audacity
when
it
appeared
advantageous
to
do
so.
All
understood
the
art
of
speaking
fair
when
a
point
was
to
be
gained,
and
could
with
consummate
skill
and
at
a
moment's
notice
turn
the
cold
shoulder
the
instant
civility
ceased
to
be
profitable.
Very
little
open
quarrelling
ever
took
place
amongst
them;
but
backbiting
and
talebearing
were
universal.
Close
friendships
were
forbidden
by
the
rules
of
the
school,
and
no
one
girl
seemed
to
cultivate
more
regard
for
another
than
was
just
necessary
to
secure
a
companion
when
solitude
would
have
been
irksome.
They
were
each
and
all
supposed
to
have
been
reared
in
utter
unconsciousness
of
vice.
The
precautions
used
to
keep
them
ignorant,
if
not
innocent,
were
innumerable.
How
was
it,
then,
that
scarcely
one
of
those
girls
having
attained
the
age
of
fourteen
could
look
a
man
in
the
face
with
modesty
and
propriety?
An
air
of
bold,
impudent
flirtation,
or
a
loose,
silly
leer,
was
sure
to
answer
the
most
ordinary
glance
from
a
masculine
eye.
I
know
nothing
of
the
arcana
of
the
Roman
Catholic
religion,
and
I
am
not
a
bigot
in
matters
of
theology,
but
I
suspect
the
root
of
this
precocious
impurity,
so
obvious,
so
general
in
Popish
countries,
is
to
be
found
in
the
discipline,
if
not
the
doctrines
of
the
Church
of
Rome.
I
record
what
I
have
seen:
these
girls
belonged
to
what
are
called
the
respectable
ranks
of
society;
they
had
all
been
carefully
brought
up,
yet
was
the
mass
of
them
mentally
depraved.
So
much
for
the
general
view:
now
for
one
or
two
selected
specimens.
The
first
picture
is
a
full
length
of
Aurelia
Koslow,
a
German
fraulein,
or
rather
a
half
breed
between
German
and
Russian.
She
is
eighteen
years
of
age,
and
has
been
sent
to
Brussels
to
finish
her
education;
she
is
of
middle
size,
stiffly
made,
body
long,
legs
short,
bust
much
developed
but
not
compactly
moulded,
waist
disproportionately
compressed
by
an
inhumanly
braced
corset,
dress
carefully
arranged,
large
feet
tortured
into
small
bottines,
head
small,
hair
smoothed,
braided,
oiled,
and
gummed
to
perfection;
very
low
forehead,
very
diminutive
and
vindictive
grey
eyes,
somewhat
Tartar
features,
rather
flat
nose,
rather
high
cheek
bones,
yet
the
ensemble
not
positively
ugly;
tolerably
good
complexion.
So
much
for
person.
As
to
mind,
deplorably
ignorant
and
ill
informed:
incapable
of
writing
or
speaking
correctly
even
German,
her
native
tongue,
a
dunce
in
French,
and
her
attempts
at
learning
English
a
mere
farce,
yet
she
has
been
at
school
twelve
years;
but
as
she
invariably
gets
her
exercises,
of
every
description,
done
by
a
fellow
pupil,
and
reads
her
lessons
off
a
book
concealed
in
her
lap,
it
is
not
wonderful
that
her
progress
has
been
so
snail
like.
I
do
not
know
what
Aurelia's
daily
habits
of
life
are,
because
I
have
not
the
opportunity
of
observing
her
at
all
times;
but
from
what
I
see
of
the
state
of
her
desk,
books,
and
papers,
I
should
say
she
is
slovenly
and
even
dirty;
her
outward
dress,
as
I
have
said,
is
well
attended
to,
but
in
passing
behind
her
bench,
I
have
remarked
that
her
neck
is
gray
for
want
of
washing,
and
her
hair,
so
glossy
with
gum
and
grease,
is
not
such
as
one
feels
tempted
to
pass
the
hand
over,
much
less
to
run
the
fingers
through.
Aurelia's
conduct
in
class,
at
least
when
I
am
present,
is
something
extraordinary,
considered
as
an
index
of
girlish
innocence.
The
moment
I
enter
the
room,
she
nudges
her
next
neighbour
and
indulges
in
a
half
suppressed
laugh.
As
I
take
my
seat
on
the
estrade,
she
fixes
her
eye
on
me;
she
seems
resolved
to
attract,
and,
if
possible,
monopolize
my
notice:
to
this
end
she
launches
at
me
all
sorts
of
looks,
languishing,
provoking,
leering,
laughing.
As
I
am
found
quite
proof
against
this
sort
of
artillery
for
we
scorn
what,
unasked,
is
lavishly
offered
she
has
recourse
to
the
expedient
of
making
noises;
sometimes
she
sighs,
sometimes
groans,
sometimes
utters
inarticulate
sounds,
for
which
language
has
no
name.
If,
in
walking
up
the
schoolroom,
I
pass
near
her,
she
puts
out
her
foot
that
it
may
touch
mine;
if
I
do
not
happen
to
observe
the
manoeuvre,
and
my
boot
comes
in
contact
with
her
brodequin,
she
affects
to
fall
into
convulsions
of
suppressed
laughter;
if
I
notice
the
snare
and
avoid
it,
she
expresses
her
mortification
in
sullen
muttering,
where
I
hear
myself
abused
in
bad
French,
pronounced
with
an
intolerable
Low
German
accent.
Not
far
from
Mdlle.
Koslow
sits
another
young
lady
by
name
Adele
Dronsart:
this
is
a
Belgian,
rather
low
of
stature,
in
form
heavy,
with
broad
waist,
short
neck
and
limbs,
good
red
and
white
complexion,
features
well
chiselled
and
regular,
well
cut
eyes
of
a
clear
brown
colour,
light
brown
hair,
good
teeth,
age
not
much
above
fifteen,
but
as
full
grown
as
a
stout
young
Englishwoman
of
twenty.
This
portrait
gives
the
idea
of
a
somewhat
dumpy
but
good
looking
damsel,
does
it
not?
Well,
when
I
looked
along
the
row
of
young
heads,
my
eye
generally
stopped
at
this
of
Adele's;
her
gaze
was
ever
waiting
for
mine,
and
it
frequently
succeeded
in
arresting
it.
She
was
an
unnatural
looking
being
so
young,
fresh,
blooming,
yet
so
Gorgon
like.
Suspicion,
sullen
ill
temper
were
on
her
forehead,
vicious
propensities
in
her
eye,
envy
and
panther
like
deceit
about
her
mouth.
In
general
she
sat
very
still;
her
massive
shape
looked
as
if
it
could
not
bend
much,
nor
did
her
large
head
so
broad
at
the
base,
so
narrow
towards
the
top
seem
made
to
turn
readily
on
her
short
neck.
She
had
but
two
varieties
of
expression;
the
prevalent
one
a
forbidding,
dissatisfied
scowl,
varied
sometimes
by
a
most
pernicious
and
perfidious
smile.
She
was
shunned
by
her
fellow
pupils,
for,
bad
as
many
of
them
were,
few
were
as
bad
as
she.
Aurelia
and
Adele
were
in
the
first
division
of
the
second
class;
the
second
division
was
headed
by
a
pensionnaire
named
Juanna
Trista.
This
girl
was
of
mixed
Belgian
and
Spanish
origin;
her
Flemish
mother
was
dead,
her
Catalonian
father
was
a
merchant
residing
in
the
Isles,
where
Juanna
had
been
born
and
whence
she
was
sent
to
Europe
to
be
educated.
I
wonder
that
any
one,
looking
at
that
girl's
head
and
countenance,
would
have
received
her
under
their
roof.
She
had
precisely
the
same
shape
of
skull
as
Pope
Alexander
the
Sixth;
her
organs
of
benevolence,
veneration,
conscientiousness,
adhesiveness,
were
singularly
small,
those
of
self
esteem,
firmness,
destructiveness,
combativeness,
preposterously
large;
her
head
sloped
up
in
the
penthouse
shape,
was
contracted
about
the
forehead,
and
prominent
behind;
she
had
rather
good,
though
large
and
marked
features;
her
temperament
was
fibrous
and
bilious,
her
complexion
pale
and
dark,
hair
and
eyes
black,
form
angular
and
rigid
but
proportionate,
age
fifteen.
Juanna
was
not
very
thin,
but
she
had
a
gaunt
visage,
and
her
"regard"
was
fierce
and
hungry;
narrow
as
was
her
brow,
it
presented
space
enough
for
the
legible
graving
of
two
words,
Mutiny
and
Hate;
in
some
one
of
her
other
lineaments
I
think
the
eye
cowardice
had
also
its
distinct
cipher.
Mdlle.
Trista
thought
fit
to
trouble
my
first
lessons
with
a
coarse
work
day
sort
of
turbulence;
she
made
noises
with
her
mouth
like
a
horse,
she
ejected
her
saliva,
she
uttered
brutal
expressions;
behind
and
below
her
were
seated
a
band
of
very
vulgar,
inferior
looking
Flamandes,
including
two
or
three
examples
of
that
deformity
of
person
and
imbecility
of
intellect
whose
frequency
in
the
Low
Countries
would
seem
to
furnish
proof
that
the
climate
is
such
as
to
induce
degeneracy
of
the
human
mind
and
body;
these,
I
soon
found,
were
completely
under
her
influence,
and
with
their
aid
she
got
up
and
sustained
a
swinish
tumult,
which
I
was
constrained
at
last
to
quell
by
ordering
her
and
two
of
her
tools
to
rise
from
their
seats,
and,
having
kept
them
standing
five
minutes,
turning
them
bodily
out
of
the
schoolroom:
the
accomplices
into
a
large
place
adjoining
called
the
grands
salle;
the
principal
into
a
cabinet,
of
which
I
closed
the
door
and
pocketed
the
key.
This
judgment
I
executed
in
the
presence
of
Mdlle.
Reuter,
who
looked
much
aghast
at
beholding
so
decided
a
proceeding
the
most
severe
that
had
ever
been
ventured
on
in
her
establishment.
Her
look
of
affright
I
answered
with
one
of
composure,
and
finally
with
a
smile,
which
perhaps
flattered,
and
certainly
soothed
her.
Juanna
Trista
remained
in
Europe
long
enough
to
repay,
by
malevolence
and
ingratitude,
all
who
had
ever
done
her
a
good
turn;
and
she
then
went
to
join
her
father
in
the
Isles,
exulting
in
the
thought
that
she
should
there
have
slaves,
whom,
as
she
said,
she
could
kick
and
strike
at
will.
These
three
pictures
are
from
the
life.
I
possess
others,
as
marked
and
as
little
agreeable,
but
I
will
spare
my
reader
the
exhibition
of
them.
Doubtless
it
will
be
thought
that
I
ought
now,
by
way
of
contrast,
to
show
something
charming;
some
gentle
virgin
head,
circled
with
a
halo,
some
sweet
personification
of
innocence,
clasping
the
dove
of
peace
to
her
bosom.
No:
I
saw
nothing
of
the
sort,
and
therefore
cannot
portray
it.
The
pupil
in
the
school
possessing
the
happiest
disposition
was
a
young
girl
from
the
country,
Louise
Path;
she
was
sufficiently
benevolent
and
obliging,
but
not
well
taught
nor
well
mannered;
moreover,
the
plague
spot
of
dissimulation
was
in
her
also;
honour
and
principle
were
unknown
to
her,
she
had
scarcely
heard
their
names.
The
least
exceptionable
pupil
was
the
poor
little
Sylvie
I
have
mentioned
once
before.
Sylvie
was
gentle
in
manners,
intelligent
in
mind;
she
was
even
sincere,
as
far
as
her
religion
would
permit
her
to
be
so,
but
her
physical
organization
was
defective;
weak
health
stunted
her
growth
and
chilled
her
spirits,
and
then,
destined
as
she
was
for
the
cloister,
her
whole
soul
was
warped
to
a
conventual
bias,
and
in
the
tame,
trained
subjection
of
her
manner,
one
read
that
she
had
already
prepared
herself
for
her
future
course
of
life,
by
giving
up
her
independence
of
thought
and
action
into
the
hands
of
some
despotic
confessor.
She
permitted
herself
no
original
opinion,
no
preference
of
companion
or
employment;
in
everything
she
was
guided
by
another.
With
a
pale,
passive,
automaton
air,
she
went
about
all
day
long
doing
what
she
was
bid;
never
what
she
liked,
or
what,
from
innate
conviction,
she
thought
it
right
to
do.
The
poor
little
future
religieuse
had
been
early
taught
to
make
the
dictates
of
her
own
reason
and
conscience
quite
subordinate
to
the
will
of
her
spiritual
director.
She
was
the
model
pupil
of
Mdlle.
Reuter's
establishment;
pale,
blighted
image,
where
life
lingered
feebly,
but
whence
the
soul
had
been
conjured
by
Romish
wizard
craft!
A
few
English
pupils
there
were
in
this
school,
and
these
might
be
divided
into
two
classes.
1st.
The
continental
English
the
daughters
chiefly
of
broken
adventurers,
whom
debt
or
dishonour
had
driven
from
their
own
country.
These
poor
girls
had
never
known
the
advantages
of
settled
homes,
decorous
example,
or
honest
Protestant
education;
resident
a
few
months
now
in
one
Catholic
school,
now
in
another,
as
their
parents
wandered
from
land
to
land
from
France
to
Germany,
from
Germany
to
Belgium
they
had
picked
up
some
scanty
instruction,
many
bad
habits,
losing
every
notion
even
of
the
first
elements
of
religion
and
morals,
and
acquiring
an
imbecile
indifference
to
every
sentiment
that
can
elevate
humanity;
they
were
distinguishable
by
an
habitual
look
of
sullen
dejection,
the
result
of
crushed
self
respect
and
constant
browbeating
from
their
Popish
fellow
pupils,
who
hated
them
as
English,
and
scorned
them
as
heretics.
The
second
class
were
British
English.
Of
these
I
did
not
encounter
half
a
dozen
during
the
whole
time
of
my
attendance
at
the
seminary;
their
characteristics
were
clean
but
careless
dress,
ill
arranged
hair
(compared
with
the
tight
and
trim
foreigners),
erect
carriage,
flexible
figures,
white
and
taper
hands,
features
more
irregular,
but
also
more
intellectual
than
those
of
the
Belgians,
grave
and
modest
countenances,
a
general
air
of
native
propriety
and
decency;
by
this
last
circumstance
alone
I
could
at
a
glance
distinguish
the
daughter
of
Albion
and
nursling
of
Protestantism
from
the
foster
child
of
Rome,
the
PROTEGEE
of
Jesuistry:
proud,
too,
was
the
aspect
of
these
British
girls;
at
once
envied
and
ridiculed
by
their
continental
associates,
they
warded
off
insult
with
austere
civility,
and
met
hate
with
mute
disdain;
they
eschewed
company
keeping,
and
in
the
midst
of
numbers
seemed
to
dwell
isolated.
The
teachers
presiding
over
this
mixed
multitude
were
three
in
number,
all
French
their
names
Mdlles.
Zephyrine,
Pelagie,
and
Suzette;
the
two
last
were
commonplace
personages
enough;
their
look
was
ordinary,
their
manner
was
ordinary,
their
temper
was
ordinary,
their
thoughts,
feelings,
and
views
were
all
ordinary
were
I
to
write
a
chapter
on
the
subject
I
could
not
elucidate
it
further.
Zephyrine
was
somewhat
more
distinguished
in
appearance
and
deportment
than
Pelagie
and
Suzette,
but
in
character
genuine
Parisian
coquette,
perfidious,
mercenary,
and
dry
hearted.
A
fourth
maitresse
I
sometimes
saw
who
seemed
to
come
daily
to
teach
needlework,
or
netting,
or
lace
mending,
or
some
such
flimsy
art;
but
of
her
I
never
had
more
than
a
passing
glimpse,
as
she
sat
in
the
CARRE,
with
her
frames
and
some
dozen
of
the
elder
pupils
about
her,
consequently
I
had
no
opportunity
of
studying
her
character,
or
even
of
observing
her
person
much;
the
latter,
I
remarked,
had
a
very
English
air
for
a
maitresse,
otherwise
it
was
not
striking;
of
character
I
should
think
she
possessed
but
little,
as
her
pupils
seemed
constantly
"en
revolte"
against
her
authority.
She
did
not
reside
in
the
house;
her
name,
I
think,
was
Mdlle.
Henri.
Amidst
this
assemblage
of
all
that
was
insignificant
and
defective,
much
that
was
vicious
and
repulsive
(by
that
last
epithet
many
would
have
described
the
two
or
three
stiff,
silent,
decently
behaved,
ill
dressed
British
girls),
the
sensible,
sagacious,
affable
directress
shone
like
a
steady
star
over
a
marsh
full
of
Jack
o'
lanthorns;
profoundly
aware
of
her
superiority,
she
derived
an
inward
bliss
from
that
consciousness
which
sustained
her
under
all
the
care
and
responsibility
inseparable
from
her
position;
it
kept
her
temper
calm,
her
brow
smooth,
her
manner
tranquil.
She
liked
as
who
would
not?
on
entering
the
school
room,
to
feel
that
her
sole
presence
sufficed
to
diffuse
that
order
and
quiet
which
all
the
remonstrances,
and
even
commands,
of
her
underlings
frequently
failed
to
enforce;
she
liked
to
stand
in
comparison,
or
rather
contrast,
with
those
who
surrounded
her,
and
to
know
that
in
personal
as
well
as
mental
advantages,
she
bore
away
the
undisputed
palm
of
preference
(the
three
teachers
were
all
plain.)
Her
pupils
she
managed
with
such
indulgence
and
address,
taking
always
on
herself
the
office
of
recompenser
and
eulogist,
and
abandoning
to
her
subalterns
every
invidious
task
of
blame
and
punishment,
that
they
all
regarded
her
with
deference,
if
not
with
affection;
her
teachers
did
not
love
her,
but
they
submitted
because
they
were
her
inferiors
in
everything;
the
various
masters
who
attended
her
school
were
each
and
all
in
some
way
or
other
under
her
influence;
over
one
she
had
acquired
power
by
her
skilful
management
of
his
bad
temper;
over
another
by
little
attentions
to
his
petty
caprices;
a
third
she
had
subdued
by
flattery;
a
fourth
a
timid
man
she
kept
in
awe
by
a
sort
of
austere
decision
of
mien;
me,
she
still
watched,
still
tried
by
the
most
ingenious
tests
she
roved
round
me,
baffled,
yet
persevering;
I
believe
she
thought
I
was
like
a
smooth
and
bare
precipice,
which
offered
neither
jutting
stone
nor
tree
root,
nor
tuft
of
grass
to
aid
the
climber.
Now
she
flattered
with
exquisite
tact,
now
she
moralized,
now
she
tried
how
far
I
was
accessible
to
mercenary
motives,
then
she
disported
on
the
brink
of
affection
knowing
that
some
men
are
won
by
weakness
anon,
she
talked
excellent
sense,
aware
that
others
have
the
folly
to
admire
judgment.
I
found
it
at
once
pleasant
and
easy
to
evade
all
these
efforts;
it
was
sweet,
when
she
thought
me
nearly
won,
to
turn
round
and
to
smile
in
her
very
eyes,
half
scornfully,
and
then
to
witness
her
scarcely
veiled,
though
mute
mortification.
Still
she
persevered,
and
at
last,
I
am
bound
to
confess
it,
her
finger,
essaying,
proving
every
atom
of
the
casket,
touched
its
secret
spring,
and
for
a
moment
the
lid
sprung
open;
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
jewel
within;
whether
she
stole
and
broke
it,
or
whether
the
lid
shut
again
with
a
snap
on
her
fingers,
read
on,
and
you
shall
know.
It
happened
that
I
came
one
day
to
give
a
lesson
when
I
was
indisposed;
I
had
a
bad
cold
and
a
cough;
two
hours'
incessant
talking
left
me
very
hoarse
and
tired;
as
I
quitted
the
schoolroom,
and
was
passing
along
the
corridor,
I
met
Mdlle.
Reuter;
she
remarked,
with
an
anxious
air,
that
I
looked
very
pale
and
tired.
"Yes,"
I
said,
"I
was
fatigued;"
and
then,
with
increased
interest,
she
rejoined,
"You
shall
not
go
away
till
you
have
had
some
refreshment."
She
persuaded
me
to
step
into
the
parlour,
and
was
very
kind
and
gentle
while
I
stayed.
The
next
day
she
was
kinder
still;
she
came
herself
into
the
class
to
see
that
the
windows
were
closed,
and
that
there
was
no
draught;
she
exhorted
me
with
friendly
earnestness
not
to
over
exert
myself;
when
I
went
away,
she
gave
me
her
hand
unasked,
and
I
could
not
but
mark,
by
a
respectful
and
gentle
pressure,
that
I
was
sensible
of
the
favour,
and
grateful
for
it.
My
modest
demonstration
kindled
a
little
merry
smile
on
her
countenance;
I
thought
her
almost
charming.
During
the
remainder
of
the
evening,
my
mind
was
full
of
impatience
for
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
to
arrive,
that
I
might
see
her
again.
I
was
not
disappointed,
for
she
sat
in
the
class
during
the
whole
of
my
subsequent
lesson,
and
often
looked
at
me
almost
with
affection.
At
four
o'clock
she
accompanied
me
out
of
the
schoolroom,
asking
with
solicitude
after
my
health,
then
scolding
me
sweetly
because
I
spoke
too
loud
and
gave
myself
too
much
trouble;
I
stopped
at
the
glass
door
which
led
into
the
garden,
to
hear
her
lecture
to
the
end;
the
door
was
open,
it
was
a
very
fine
day,
and
while
I
listened
to
the
soothing
reprimand,
I
looked
at
the
sunshine
and
flowers,
and
felt
very
happy.
The
day
scholars
began
to
pour
from
the
schoolrooms
into
the
passage.
"Will
you
go
into
the
garden
a
minute
or
two,"
asked
she,
"till
they
are
gone?"
I
descended
the
steps
without
answering,
but
I
looked
back
as
much
as
to
say
"You
will
come
with
me?"
In
another
minute
I
and
the
directress
were
walking
side
by
side
down
the
alley
bordered
with
fruit
trees,
whose
white
blossoms
were
then
in
full
blow
as
well
as
their
tender
green
leaves.
The
sky
was
blue,
the
air
still,
the
May
afternoon
was
full
of
brightness
and
fragrance.
Released
from
the
stifling
class,
surrounded
with
flowers
and
foliage,
with
a
pleasing,
smiling,
affable
woman
at
my
side
how
did
I
feel?
Why,
very
enviably.
It
seemed
as
if
the
romantic
visions
my
imagination
had
suggested
of
this
garden,
while
it
was
yet
hidden
from
me
by
the
jealous
boards,
were
more
than
realized;
and,
when
a
turn
in
the
alley
shut
out
the
view
of
the
house,
and
some
tall
shrubs
excluded
M.
Pelet's
mansion,
and
screened
us
momentarily
from
the
other
houses,
rising
amphitheatre
like
round
this
green
spot,
I
gave
my
arm
to
Mdlle.
Reuter,
and
led
her
to
a
garden
chair,
nestled
under
some
lilacs
near.
She
sat
down;
I
took
my
place
at
her
side.
She
went
on
talking
to
me
with
that
ease
which
communicates
ease,
and,
as
I
listened,
a
revelation
dawned
in
my
mind
that
I
was
on
the
brink
of
falling
in
love.
The
dinner
bell
rang,
both
at
her
house
and
M.
Pelet's;
we
were
obliged
to
part;
I
detained
her
a
moment
as
she
was
moving
away.
"I
want
something,"
said
I.
"What?"
asked
Zoraide
naively.
"Only
a
flower."
"Gather
it
then
or
two,
or
twenty,
if
you
like."
"No
one
will
do
but
you
must
gather
it,
and
give
it
to
me."
"What
a
caprice!"
she
exclaimed,
but
she
raised
herself
on
her
tip
toes,
and,
plucking
a
beautiful
branch
of
lilac,
offered
it
to
me
with
grace.
I
took
it,
and
went
away,
satisfied
for
the
present,
and
hopeful
for
the
future.
Certainly
that
May
day
was
a
lovely
one,
and
it
closed
in
moonlight
night
of
summer
warmth
and
serenity.
I
remember
this
well;
for,
having
sat
up
late
that
evening,
correcting
devoirs,
and
feeling
weary
and
a
little
oppressed
with
the
closeness
of
my
small
room,
I
opened
the
often
mentioned
boarded
window,
whose
boards,
however,
I
had
persuaded
old
Madame
Pelet
to
have
removed
since
I
had
filled
the
post
of
professor
in
the
pensionnat
de
demoiselles,
as,
from
that
time,
it
was
no
longer
"inconvenient"
for
me
to
overlook
my
own
pupils
at
their
sports.
I
sat
down
in
the
window
seat,
rested
my
arm
on
the
sill,
and
leaned
out:
above
me
was
the
clear
obscure
of
a
cloudless
night
sky
splendid
moonlight
subdued
the
tremulous
sparkle
of
the
stars
below
lay
the
garden,
varied
with
silvery
lustre
and
deep
shade,
and
all
fresh
with
dew
a
grateful
perfume
exhaled
from
the
closed
blossoms
of
the
fruit
trees
not
a
leaf
stirred,
the
night
was
breezeless.
My
window
looked
directly
down
upon
a
certain
walk
of
Mdlle.
Reuter's
garden,
called
"l'allee
defendue,"
so
named
because
the
pupils
were
forbidden
to
enter
it
on
account
of
its
proximity
to
the
boys'
school.
It
was
here
that
the
lilacs
and
laburnums
grew
especially
thick;
this
was
the
most
sheltered
nook
in
the
enclosure,
its
shrubs
screened
the
garden
chair
where
that
afternoon
I
had
sat
with
the
young
directress.
I
need
not
say
that
my
thoughts
were
chiefly
with
her
as
I
leaned
from
the
lattice,
and
let
my
eye
roam,
now
over
the
walks
and
borders
of
the
garden,
now
along
the
many
windowed
front
of
the
house
which
rose
white
beyond
the
masses
of
foliage.
I
wondered
in
what
part
of
the
building
was
situated
her
apartment;
and
a
single
light,
shining
through
the
persiennes
of
one
croisee,
seemed
to
direct
me
to
it.
"She
watches
late,"
thought
I,
"for
it
must
be
now
near
midnight.
She
is
a
fascinating
little
woman,"
I
continued
in
voiceless
soliloquy;
"her
image
forms
a
pleasant
picture
in
memory;
I
know
she
is
not
what
the
world
calls
pretty
no
matter,
there
is
harmony
in
her
aspect,
and
I
like
it;
her
brown
hair,
her
blue
eye,
the
freshness
of
her
cheek,
the
whiteness
of
her
neck,
all
suit
my
taste.
Then
I
respect
her
talent;
the
idea
of
marrying
a
doll
or
a
fool
was
always
abhorrent
to
me:
I
know
that
a
pretty
doll,
a
fair
fool,
might
do
well
enough
for
the
honeymoon;
but
when
passion
cooled,
how
dreadful
to
find
a
lump
of
wax
and
wood
laid
in
my
bosom,
a
half
idiot
clasped
in
my
arms,
and
to
remember
that
I
had
made
of
this
my
equal
nay,
my
idol
to
know
that
I
must
pass
the
rest
of
my
dreary
life
with
a
creature
incapable
of
understanding
what
I
said,
of
appreciating
what
I
thought,
or
of
sympathizing
with
what
I
felt!
"Now,
Zoraide
Reuter,"
thought
I,
"has
tact,
CARACTERE,
judgment,
discretion;
has
she
heart?
What
a
good,
simple
little
smile
played
about
her
lips
when
she
gave
me
the
branch
of
lilacs!
I
have
thought
her
crafty,
dissembling,
interested
sometimes,
it
is
true;
but
may
not
much
that
looks
like
cunning
and
dissimulation
in
her
conduct
be
only
the
efforts
made
by
a
bland
temper
to
traverse
quietly
perplexing
difficulties?
And
as
to
interest,
she
wishes
to
make
her
way
in
the
world,
no
doubt,
and
who
can
blame
her?
Even
if
she
be
truly
deficient
in
sound
principle,
is
it
not
rather
her
misfortune
than
her
fault?
She
has
been
brought
up
a
Catholic:
had
she
been
born
an
Englishwoman,
and
reared
a
Protestant,
might
she
not
have
added
straight
integrity
to
all
her
other
excellences?
Supposing
she
were
to
marry
an
English
and
Protestant
husband,
would
she
not,
rational,
sensible
as
she
is,
quickly
acknowledge
the
superiority
of
right
over
expediency,
honesty
over
policy?
It
would
be
worth
a
man's
while
to
try
the
experiment;
to
morrow
I
will
renew
my
observations.
She
knows
that
I
watch
her:
how
calm
she
is
under
scrutiny!
it
seems
rather
to
gratify
than
annoy
her."
Here
a
strain
of
music
stole
in
upon
my
monologue,
and
suspended
it;
it
was
a
bugle,
very
skilfully
played,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
park,
I
thought,
or
on
the
Place
Royale.
So
sweet
were
the
tones,
so
subduing
their
effect
at
that
hour,
in
the
midst
of
silence
and
under
the
quiet
reign
of
moonlight,
I
ceased
to
think,
that
I
might
listen
more
intently.
The
strain
retreated,
its
sound
waxed
fainter
and
was
soon
gone;
my
ear
prepared
to
repose
on
the
absolute
hush
of
midnight
once
more.
No.
What
murmur
was
that
which,
low,
and
yet
near
and
approaching
nearer,
frustrated
the
expectation
of
total
silence?
It
was
some
one
conversing
yes,
evidently,
an
audible,
though
subdued
voice
spoke
in
the
garden
immediately
below
me.
Another
answered;
the
first
voice
was
that
of
a
man,
the
second
that
of
a
woman;
and
a
man
and
a
woman
I
saw
coming
slowly
down
the
alley.
Their
forms
were
at
first
in
shade,
I
could
but
discern
a
dusk
outline
of
each,
but
a
ray
of
moonlight
met
them
at
the
termination
of
the
walk,
when
they
were
under
my
very
nose,
and
revealed
very
plainly,
very
unequivocally,
Mdlle.
Zoraide
Reuter,
arm
in
arm,
or
hand
in
hand
(I
forget
which)
with
my
principal,
confidant,
and
counsellor,
M.
Francois
Pelet.
And
M.
Pelet
was
saying
"A
quand
donc
le
jour
des
noces,
ma
bien
aimee?"
And
Mdlle.
Reuter
answered
"Mais,
Francois,
tu
sais
bien
qu'il
me
serait
impossible
de
me
marier
avant
les
vacances."
"June,
July,
August,
a
whole
quarter!"
exclaimed
the
director.
"How
can
I
wait
so
long?
I
who
am
ready,
even
now,
to
expire
at
your
feet
with
impatience!"
"Ah!
if
you
die,
the
whole
affair
will
be
settled
without
any
trouble
about
notaries
and
contracts;
I
shall
only
have
to
order
a
slight
mourning
dress,
which
will
be
much
sooner
prepared
than
the
nuptial
trousseau."
"Cruel
Zoraide!
you
laugh
at
the
distress
of
one
who
loves
you
so
devotedly
as
I
do:
my
torment
is
your
sport;
you
scruple
not
to
stretch
my
soul
on
the
rack
of
jealousy;
for,
deny
it
as
you
will,
I
am
certain
you
have
cast
encouraging
glances
on
that
school
boy,
Crimsworth;
he
has
presumed
to
fall
in
love,
which
he
dared
not
have
done
unless
you
had
given
him
room
to
hope."
"What
do
you
say,
Francois?
Do
you
say
Crimsworth
is
in
love
with
me?"
"Over
head
and
ears."
"Has
he
told
you
so?"
"No
but
I
see
it
in
his
face:
he
blushes
whenever
your
name
is
mentioned."
A
little
laugh
of
exulting
coquetry
announced
Mdlle.
Reuter's
gratification
at
this
piece
of
intelligence
(which
was
a
lie,
by
the
by
I
had
never
been
so
far
gone
as
that,
after
all).
M.
Pelet
proceeded
to
ask
what
she
intended
to
do
with
me,
intimating
pretty
plainly,
and
not
very
gallantly,
that
it
was
nonsense
for
her
to
think
of
taking
such
a
"blanc
bec"
as
a
husband,
since
she
must
be
at
least
ten
years
older
than
I
(was
she
then
thirty
two?
I
should
not
have
thought
it).
I
heard
her
disclaim
any
intentions
on
the
subject
the
director,
however,
still
pressed
her
to
give
a
definite
answer.
"Francois,"
said
she,
"you
are
jealous,"
and
still
she
laughed;
then,
as
if
suddenly
recollecting
that
this
coquetry
was
not
consistent
with
the
character
for
modest
dignity
she
wished
to
establish,
she
proceeded,
in
a
demure
voice:
"Truly,
my
dear
Francois,
I
will
not
deny
that
this
young
Englishman
may
have
made
some
attempts
to
ingratiate
himself
with
me;
but,
so
far
from
giving
him
any
encouragement,
I
have
always
treated
him
with
as
much
reserve
as
it
was
possible
to
combine
with
civility;
affianced
as
I
am
to
you,
I
would
give
no
man
false
hopes;
believe
me,
dear
friend."
Still
Pelet
uttered
murmurs
of
distrust
so
I
judged,
at
least,
from
her
reply.
"What
folly!
How
could
I
prefer
an
unknown
foreigner
to
you?
And
then
not
to
flatter
your
vanity
Crimsworth
could
not
bear
comparison
with
you
either
physically
or
mentally;
he
is
not
a
handsome
man
at
all;
some
may
call
him
gentleman
like
and
intelligent
looking,
but
for
my
part
"
The
rest
of
the
sentence
was
lost
in
the
distance,
as
the
pair,
rising
from
the
chair
in
which
they
had
been
seated,
moved
away.
I
waited
their
return,
but
soon
the
opening
and
shutting
of
a
door
informed
me
that
they
had
re
entered
the
house;
I
listened
a
little
longer,
all
was
perfectly
still;
I
listened
more
than
an
hour
at
last
I
heard
M.
Pelet
come
in
and
ascend
to
his
chamber.
Glancing
once
more
towards
the
long
front
of
the
garden
house,
I
perceived
that
its
solitary
light
was
at
length
extinguished;
so,
for
a
time,
was
my
faith
in
love
and
friendship.
I
went
to
bed,
but
something
feverish
and
fiery
had
got
into
my
veins
which
prevented
me
from
sleeping
much
that
night.
NEXT
morning
I
rose
with
the
dawn,
and
having
dressed
myself
and
stood
half
an
hour,
my
elbow
leaning
on
the
chest
of
drawers,
considering
what
means
I
should
adopt
to
restore
my
spirits,
fagged
with
sleeplessness,
to
their
ordinary
tone
for
I
had
no
intention
of
getting
up
a
scene
with
M.
Pelet,
reproaching
him
with
perfidy,
sending
him
a
challenge,
or
performing
other
gambadoes
of
the
sort
I
hit
at
last
on
the
expedient
of
walking
out
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
to
a
neighbouring
establishment
of
baths,
and
treating
myself
to
a
bracing
plunge.
The
remedy
produced
the
desired
effect.
I
came
back
at
seven
o'clock
steadied
and
invigorated,
and
was
able
to
greet
M.
Pelet,
when
he
entered
to
breakfast,
with
an
unchanged
and
tranquil
countenance;
even
a
cordial
offering
of
the
hand
and
the
flattering
appellation
of
"mon
fils,"
pronounced
in
that
caressing
tone
with
which
Monsieur
had,
of
late
days
especially,
been
accustomed
to
address
me,
did
not
elicit
any
external
sign
of
the
feeling
which,
though
subdued,
still
glowed
at
my
heart.
Not
that
I
nursed
vengeance
no;
but
the
sense
of
insult
and
treachery
lived
in
me
like
a
kindling,
though
as
yet
smothered
coal.
God
knows
I
am
not
by
nature
vindictive;
I
would
not
hurt
a
man
because
I
can
no
longer
trust
or
like
him;
but
neither
my
reason
nor
feelings
are
of
the
vacillating
order
they
are
not
of
that
sand
like
sort
where
impressions,
if
soon
made,
are
as
soon
effaced.
Once
convinced
that
my
friend's
disposition
is
incompatible
with
my
own,
once
assured
that
he
is
indelibly
stained
with
certain
defects
obnoxious
to
my
principles,
and
I
dissolve
the
connection.
I
did
so
with
Edward.
As
to
Pelet,
the
discovery
was
yet
new;
should
I
act
thus
with
him?
It
was
the
question
I
placed
before
my
mind
as
I
stirred
my
cup
of
coffee
with
a
half
pistolet
(we
never
had
spoons),
Pelet
meantime
being
seated
opposite,
his
pallid
face
looking
as
knowing
and
more
haggard
than
usual,
his
blue
eye
turned,
now
sternly
on
his
boys
and
ushers,
and
now
graciously
on
me.
"Circumstances
must
guide
me,"
said
I;
and
meeting
Pelet's
false
glance
and
insinuating
smile,
I
thanked
heaven
that
I
had
last
night
opened
my
window
and
read
by
the
light
of
a
full
moon
the
true
meaning
of
that
guileful
countenance.
I
felt
half
his
master,
because
the
reality
of
his
nature
was
now
known
to
me;
smile
and
flatter
as
he
would,
I
saw
his
soul
lurk
behind
his
smile,
and
heard
in
every
one
of
his
smooth
phrases
a
voice
interpreting
their
treacherous
import.
But
Zoraide
Reuter?
Of
course
her
defection
had
cut
me
to
the
quick?
That
stint
must
have
gone
too
deep
for
any
consolations
of
philosophy
to
be
available
in
curing
its
smart?
Not
at
all.
The
night
fever
over,
I
looked
about
for
balm
to
that
wound
also,
and
found
some
nearer
home
than
at
Gilead.
Reason
was
my
physician;
she
began
by
proving
that
the
prize
I
had
missed
was
of
little
value:
she
admitted
that,
physically,
Zoraide
might
have
suited
me,
but
affirmed
that
our
souls
were
not
in
harmony,
and
that
discord
must
have
resulted
from
the
union
of
her
mind
with
mine.
She
then
insisted
on
the
suppression
of
all
repining,
and
commanded
me
rather
to
rejoice
that
I
had
escaped
a
snare.
Her
medicament
did
me
good.
I
felt
its
strengthening
effect
when
I
met
the
directress
the
next
day;
its
stringent
operation
on
the
nerves
suffered
no
trembling,
no
faltering;
it
enabled
me
to
face
her
with
firmness,
to
pass
her
with
ease.
She
had
held
out
her
hand
to
me
that
I
did
not
choose
to
see.
She
had
greeted
me
with
a
charming
smile
it
fell
on
my
heart
like
light
on
stone.
I
passed
on
to
the
estrade,
she
followed
me;
her
eye,
fastened
on
my
face,
demanded
of
every
feature
the
meaning
of
my
changed
and
careless
manner.
"I
will
give
her
an
answer,"
thought
I;
and,
meeting
her
gaze
full,
arresting,
fixing
her
glance,
I
shot
into
her
eyes,
from
my
own,
a
look,
where
there
was
no
respect,
no
love,
no
tenderness,
no
gallantry;
where
the
strictest
analysis
could
detect
nothing
but
scorn,
hardihood,
irony.
I
made
her
bear
it,
and
feel
it;
her
steady
countenance
did
not
change,
but
her
colour
rose,
and
she
approached
me
as
if
fascinated.
She
stepped
on
to
the
estrade,
and
stood
close
by
my
side;
she
had
nothing
to
say.
I
would
not
relieve
her
embarrassment,
and
negligently
turned
over
the
leaves
of
a
book.
"I
hope
you
feel
quite
recovered
to
day,"
at
last
she
said,
in
a
low
tone.
"And
I,
mademoiselle,
hope
that
you
took
no
cold
last
night
in
consequence
of
your
late
walk
in
the
garden."
Quick
enough
of
comprehension,
she
understood
me
directly;
her
face
became
a
little
blanched
a
very
little
but
no
muscle
in
her
rather
marked
features
moved;
and,
calm
and
self
possessed,
she
retired
from
the
estrade,
taking
her
seat
quietly
at
a
little
distance,
and
occupying
herself
with
netting
a
purse.
I
proceeded
to
give
my
lesson;
it
was
a
"Composition,"
i.e.,
I
dictated
certain
general
questions,
of
which
the
pupils
were
to
compose
the
answers
from
memory,
access
to
books
being
forbidden.
While
Mdlle.
Eulalie,
Hortense,
Caroline,
&c.,
were
pondering
over
the
string
of
rather
abstruse
grammatical
interrogatories
I
had
propounded,
I
was
at
liberty
to
employ
the
vacant
half
hour
in
further
observing
the
directress
herself.
The
green
silk
purse
was
progressing
fast
in
her
hands;
her
eyes
were
bent
upon
it;
her
attitude,
as
she
sat
netting
within
two
yards
of
me,
was
still
yet
guarded;
in
her
whole
person
were
expressed
at
once,
and
with
equal
clearness,
vigilance
and
repose
a
rare
union!
Looking
at
her,
I
was
forced,
as
I
had
often
been
before,
to
offer
her
good
sense,
her
wondrous
self
control,
the
tribute
of
involuntary
admiration.
She
had
felt
that
I
had
withdrawn
from
her
my
esteem;
she
had
seen
contempt
and
coldness
in
my
eye,
and
to
her,
who
coveted
the
approbation
of
all
around
her,
who
thirsted
after
universal
good
opinion,
such
discovery
must
have
been
an
acute
wound.
I
had
witnessed
its
effect
in
the
momentary
pallor
of
her
cheek
cheek
unused
to
vary;
yet
how
quickly,
by
dint
of
self
control,
had
she
recovered
her
composure!
With
what
quiet
dignity
she
now
sat,
almost
at
my
side,
sustained
by
her
sound
and
vigorous
sense;
no
trembling
in
her
somewhat
lengthened,
though
shrewd
upper
lip,
no
coward
shame
on
her
austere
forehead!
"There
is
metal
there,"
I
said,
as
I
gazed.
"Would
that
there
were
fire
also,
living
ardour
to
make
the
steel
glow
then
I
could
love
her."
Presently
I
discovered
that
she
knew
I
was
watching
her,
for
she
stirred
not,
she
lifted
not
her
crafty
eyelid;
she
had
glanced
down
from
her
netting
to
her
small
foot,
peeping
from
the
soft
folds
of
her
purple
merino
gown;
thence
her
eye
reverted
to
her
hand,
ivory
white,
with
a
bright
garnet
ring
on
the
forefinger,
and
a
light
frill
of
lace
round
the
wrist;
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
movement
she
turned
her
head,
causing
her
nut
brown
curls
to
wave
gracefully.
In
these
slight
signs
I
read
that
the
wish
of
her
heart,
the
design
of
her
brain,
was
to
lure
back
the
game
she
had
scared.
A
little
incident
gave
her
the
opportunity
of
addressing
me
again.
While
all
was
silence
in
the
class
silence,
but
for
the
rustling
of
copy
books
and
the
travelling
of
pens
over
their
pages
a
leaf
of
the
large
folding
door,
opening
from
the
hall,
unclosed,
admitting
a
pupil
who,
after
making
a
hasty
obeisance,
ensconced
herself
with
some
appearance
of
trepidation,
probably
occasioned
by
her
entering
so
late,
in
a
vacant
seat
at
the
desk
nearest
the
door.
Being
seated,
she
proceeded,
still
with
an
air
of
hurry
and
embarrassment,
to
open
her
cabas,
to
take
out
her
books;
and,
while
I
was
waiting
for
her
to
look
up,
in
order
to
make
out
her
identity
for,
shortsighted
as
I
was,
I
had
not
recognized
her
at
her
entrance
Mdlle.
Reuter,
leaving
her
chair,
approached
the
estrade.
"Monsieur
Creemsvort,"
said
she,
in
a
whisper:
for
when
the
schoolrooms
were
silent,
the
directress
always
moved
with
velvet
tread,
and
spoke
in
the
most
subdued
key,
enforcing
order
and
stillness
fully
as
much
by
example
as
precept:
"Monsieur
Creemsvort,
that
young
person,
who
has
just
entered,
wishes
to
have
the
advantage
of
taking
lessons
with
you
in
English;
she
is
not
a
pupil
of
the
house;
she
is,
indeed,
in
one
sense,
a
teacher,
for
she
gives
instruction
in
lace
mending,
and
in
little
varieties
of
ornamental
needle
work.
She
very
properly
proposes
to
qualify
herself
for
a
higher
department
of
education,
and
has
asked
permission
to
attend
your
lessons,
in
order
to
perfect
her
knowledge
of
English,
in
which
language
she
has,
I
believe,
already
made
some
progress;
of
course
it
is
my
wish
to
aid
her
in
an
effort
so
praiseworthy;
you
will
permit
her
then
to
benefit
by
your
instruction
n'est
ce
pas,
monsieur?"
And
Mdlle.
Reuter's
eyes
were
raised
to
mine
with
a
look
at
once
naive,
benign,
and
beseeching.
I
replied,
"Of
course,"
very
laconically,
almost
abruptly.
"Another
word,"
she
said,
with
softness:
"Mdlle.
Henri
has
not
received
a
regular
education;
perhaps
her
natural
talents
are
not
of
the
highest
order:
but
I
can
assure
you
of
the
excellence
of
her
intentions,
and
even
of
the
amiability
of
her
disposition.
Monsieur
will
then,
I
am
sure,
have
the
goodness
to
be
considerate
with
her
at
first,
and
not
expose
her
backwardness,
her
inevitable
deficiencies,
before
the
young
ladies,
who,
in
a
sense,
are
her
pupils.
Will
Monsieur
Creemsvort
favour
me
by
attending
to
this
hint?"
I
nodded.
She
continued
with
subdued
earnestness
"Pardon
me,
monsieur,
if
I
venture
to
add
that
what
I
have
just
said
is
of
importance
to
the
poor
girl;
she
already
experiences
great
difficulty
in
impressing
these
giddy
young
things
with
a
due
degree
of
deference
for
her
authority,
and
should
that
difficulty
be
increased
by
new
discoveries
of
her
incapacity,
she
might
find
her
position
in
my
establishment
too
painful
to
be
retained;
a
circumstance
I
should
much
regret
for
her
sake,
as
she
can
ill
afford
to
lose
the
profits
of
her
occupation
here."
Mdlle.
Reuter
possessed
marvellous
tact;
but
tact
the
most
exclusive,
unsupported
by
sincerity,
will
sometimes
fail
of
its
effect;
thus,
on
this
occasion,
the
longer
she
preached
about
the
necessity
of
being
indulgent
to
the
governess
pupil,
the
more
impatient
I
felt
as
I
listened.
I
discerned
so
clearly
that
while
her
professed
motive
was
a
wish
to
aid
the
dull,
though
well
meaning
Mdlle.
Henri,
her
real
one
was
no
other
than
a
design
to
impress
me
with
an
idea
of
her
own
exalted
goodness
and
tender
considerateness;
so
having
again
hastily
nodded
assent
to
her
remarks,
I
obviated
their
renewal
by
suddenly
demanding
the
compositions,
in
a
sharp
accent,
and
stepping
from
the
estrade,
I
proceeded
to
collect
them.
As
I
passed
the
governess
pupil,
I
said
to
her
"You
have
come
in
too
late
to
receive
a
lesson
to
day;
try
to
be
more
punctual
next
time."
I
was
behind
her,
and
could
not
read
in
her
face
the
effect
of
my
not
very
civil
speech.
Probably
I
should
not
have
troubled
myself
to
do
so,
had
I
been
full
in
front;
but
I
observed
that
she
immediately
began
to
slip
her
books
into
her
cabas
again;
and,
presently,
after
I
had
returned
to
the
estrade,
while
I
was
arranging
the
mass
of
compositions,
I
heard
the
folding
door
again
open
and
close;
and,
on
looking
up,
I
perceived
her
place
vacant.
I
thought
to
myself,
"She
will
consider
her
first
attempt
at
taking
a
lesson
in
English
something
of
a
failure;"
and
I
wondered
whether
she
had
departed
in
the
sulks,
or
whether
stupidity
had
induced
her
to
take
my
words
too
literally,
or,
finally,
whether
my
irritable
tone
had
wounded
her
feelings.
The
last
notion
I
dismissed
almost
as
soon
as
I
had
conceived
it,
for
not
having
seen
any
appearance
of
sensitiveness
in
any
human
face
since
my
arrival
in
Belgium,
I
had
begun
to
regard
it
almost
as
a
fabulous
quality.
Whether
her
physiognomy
announced
it
I
could
not
tell,
for
her
speedy
exit
had
allowed
me
no
time
to
ascertain
the
circumstance.
I
had,
indeed,
on
two
or
three
previous
occasions,
caught
a
passing
view
of
her
(as
I
believe
has
been
mentioned
before);
but
I
had
never
stopped
to
scrutinize
either
her
face
or
person,
and
had
but
the
most
vague
idea
of
her
general
appearance.
Just
as
I
had
finished
rolling
up
the
compositions,
the
four
o'clock
bell
rang;
with
my
accustomed
alertness
in
obeying
that
signal,
I
grasped
my
hat
and
evacuated
the
premises.
IF
I
was
punctual
in
quitting
Mdlle.
Reuter's
domicile,
I
was
at
least
equally
punctual
in
arriving
there;
I
came
the
next
day
at
five
minutes
before
two,
and
on
reaching
the
schoolroom
door,
before
I
opened
it,
I
heard
a
rapid,
gabbling
sound,
which
warned
me
that
the
"priere
du
midi"
was
not
yet
concluded.
I
waited
the
termination
thereof;
it
would
have
been
impious
to
intrude
my
heretical
presence
during
its
progress.
How
the
repeater
of
the
prayer
did
cackle
and
splutter!
I
never
before
or
since
heard
language
enounced
with
such
steam
engine
haste.
"Notre
Pere
qui
etes
au
ciel"
went
off
like
a
shot;
then
followed
an
address
to
Marie
"vierge
celeste,
reine
des
anges,
maison
d'or,
tour
d'ivoire!"
and
then
an
invocation
to
the
saint
of
the
day;
and
then
down
they
all
sat,
and
the
solemn
(?)
rite
was
over;
and
I
entered,
flinging
the
door
wide
and
striding
in
fast,
as
it
was
my
wont
to
do
now;
for
I
had
found
that
in
entering
with
aplomb,
and
mounting
the
estrade
with
emphasis,
consisted
the
grand
secret
of
ensuring
immediate
silence.
The
folding
doors
between
the
two
classes,
opened
for
the
prayer,
were
instantly
closed;
a
maitresse,
work
box
in
hand,
took
her
seat
at
her
appropriate
desk;
the
pupils
sat
still
with
their
pens
and
books
before
them;
my
three
beauties
in
the
van,
now
well
humbled
by
a
demeanour
of
consistent
coolness,
sat
erect
with
their
hands
folded
quietly
on
their
knees;
they
had
given
up
giggling
and
whispering
to
each
other,
and
no
longer
ventured
to
utter
pert
speeches
in
my
presence;
they
now
only
talked
to
me
occasionally
with
their
eyes,
by
means
of
which
organs
they
could
still,
however,
say
very
audacious
and
coquettish
things.
Had
affection,
goodness,
modesty,
real
talent,
ever
employed
those
bright
orbs
as
interpreters,
I
do
not
think
I
could
have
refrained
from
giving
a
kind
and
encouraging,
perhaps
an
ardent
reply
now
and
then;
but
as
it
was,
I
found
pleasure
in
answering
the
glance
of
vanity
with
the
gaze
of
stoicism.
Youthful,
fair,
brilliant,
as
were
many
of
my
pupils,
I
can
truly
say
that
in
me
they
never
saw
any
other
bearing
than
such
as
an
austere,
though
just
guardian,
might
have
observed
towards
them.
If
any
doubt
the
accuracy
of
this
assertion,
as
inferring
more
conscientious
self
denial
or
Scipio
like
self
control
than
they
feel
disposed
to
give
me
credit
for,
let
them
take
into
consideration
the
following
circumstances,
which,
while
detracting
from
my
merit,
justify
my
veracity.
Know,
O
incredulous
reader!
that
a
master
stands
in
a
somewhat
different
relation
towards
a
pretty,
light
headed,
probably
ignorant
girl,
to
that
occupied
by
a
partner
at
a
ball,
or
a
gallant
on
the
promenade.
A
professor
does
not
meet
his
pupil
to
see
her
dressed
in
satin
and
muslin,
with
hair
perfumed
and
curled,
neck
scarcely
shaded
by
aerial
lace,
round
white
arms
circled
with
bracelets,
feet
dressed
for
the
gliding
dance.
It
is
not
his
business
to
whirl
her
through
the
waltz,
to
feed
her
with
compliments,
to
heighten
her
beauty
by
the
flush
of
gratified
vanity.
Neither
does
he
encounter
her
on
the
smooth
rolled,
tree
shaded
Boulevard,
in
the
green
and
sunny
park,
whither
she
repairs
clad
in
her
becoming
walking
dress,
her
scarf
thrown
with
grace
over
her
shoulders,
her
little
bonnet
scarcely
screening
her
curls,
the
red
rose
under
its
brim
adding
a
new
tint
to
the
softer
rose
on
her
cheek;
her
face
and
eyes,
too,
illumined
with
smiles,
perhaps
as
transient
as
the
sunshine
of
the
gala
day,
but
also
quite
as
brilliant;
it
is
not
his
office
to
walk
by
her
side,
to
listen
to
her
lively
chat,
to
carry
her
parasol,
scarcely
larger
than
a
broad
green
leaf,
to
lead
in
a
ribbon
her
Blenheim
spaniel
or
Italian
greyhound.
No:
he
finds
her
in
the
schoolroom,
plainly
dressed,
with
books
before
her.
Owing
to
her
education
or
her
nature
books
are
to
her
a
nuisance,
and
she
opens
them
with
aversion,
yet
her
teacher
must
instil
into
her
mind
the
contents
of
these
books;
that
mind
resists
the
admission
of
grave
information,
it
recoils,
it
grows
restive,
sullen
tempers
are
shown,
disfiguring
frowns
spoil
the
symmetry
of
the
face,
sometimes
coarse
gestures
banish
grace
from
the
deportment,
while
muttered
expressions,
redolent
of
native
and
ineradicable
vulgarity,
desecrate
the
sweetness
of
the
voice.
Where
the
temperament
is
serene
though
the
intellect
be
sluggish,
an
unconquerable
dullness
opposes
every
effort
to
instruct.
Where
there
is
cunning
but
not
energy,
dissimulation,
falsehood,
a
thousand
schemes
and
tricks
are
put
in
play
to
evade
the
necessity
of
application;
in
short,
to
the
tutor,
female
youth,
female
charms
are
like
tapestry
hangings,
of
which
the
wrong
side
is
continually
turned
towards
him;
and
even
when
he
sees
the
smooth,
neat
external
surface
he
so
well
knows
what
knots,
long
stitches,
and
jagged
ends
are
behind
that
he
has
scarce
a
temptation
to
admire
too
fondly
the
seemly
forms
and
bright
colours
exposed
to
general
view.
Our
likings
are
regulated
by
our
circumstances.
The
artist
prefers
a
hilly
country
because
it
is
picturesque;
the
engineer
a
flat
one
because
it
is
convenient;
the
man
of
pleasure
likes
what
he
calls
"a
fine
woman"
she
suits
him;
the
fashionable
young
gentleman
admires
the
fashionable
young
lady
she
is
of
his
kind;
the
toil
worn,
fagged,
probably
irritable
tutor,
blind
almost
to
beauty,
insensible
to
airs
and
graces,
glories
chiefly
in
certain
mental
qualities:
application,
love
of
knowledge,
natural
capacity,
docility,
truthfulness,
gratefulness,
are
the
charms
that
attract
his
notice
and
win
his
regard.
These
he
seeks,
but
seldom
meets;
these,
if
by
chance
he
finds,
he
would
fain
retain
for
ever,
and
when
separation
deprives
him
of
them
he
feels
as
if
some
ruthless
hand
had
snatched
from
him
his
only
ewe
lamb.
Such
being
the
case,
and
the
case
it
is,
my
readers
will
agree
with
me
that
there
was
nothing
either
very
meritorious
or
very
marvellous
in
the
integrity
and
moderation
of
my
conduct
at
Mdlle.
Reuter's
pensionnat
de
demoiselles.
My
first
business
this
afternoon
consisted
in
reading
the
list
of
places
for
the
month,
determined
by
the
relative
correctness
of
the
compositions
given
the
preceding
day.
The
list
was
headed,
as
usual,
by
the
name
of
Sylvie,
that
plain,
quiet
little
girl
I
have
described
before
as
being
at
once
the
best
and
ugliest
pupil
in
the
establishment;
the
second
place
had
fallen
to
the
lot
of
a
certain
Leonie
Ledru,
a
diminutive,
sharp
featured,
and
parchment
skinned
creature
of
quick
wits,
frail
conscience,
and
indurated
feelings;
a
lawyer
like
thing,
of
whom
I
used
to
say
that,
had
she
been
a
boy,
she
would
have
made
a
model
of
an
unprincipled,
clever
attorney.
Then
came
Eulalie,
the
proud
beauty,
the
Juno
of
the
school,
whom
six
long
years
of
drilling
in
the
simple
grammar
of
the
English
language
had
compelled,
despite
the
stiff
phlegm
of
her
intellect,
to
acquire
a
mechanical
acquaintance
with
most
of
its
rules.
No
smile,
no
trace
of
pleasure
or
satisfaction
appeared
in
Sylvie's
nun
like
and
passive
face
as
she
heard
her
name
read
first.
I
always
felt
saddened
by
the
sight
of
that
poor
girl's
absolute
quiescence
on
all
occasions,
and
it
was
my
custom
to
look
at
her,
to
address
her,
as
seldom
as
possible;
her
extreme
docility,
her
assiduous
perseverance,
would
have
recommended
her
warmly
to
my
good
opinion;
her
modesty,
her
intelligence,
would
have
induced
me
to
feel
most
kindly
most
affectionately
towards
her,
notwithstanding
the
almost
ghastly
plainness
of
her
features,
the
disproportion
of
her
form,
the
corpse
like
lack
of
animation
in
her
countenance,
had
I
not
been
aware
that
every
friendly
word,
every
kindly
action,
would
be
reported
by
her
to
her
confessor,
and
by
him
misinterpreted
and
poisoned.
Once
I
laid
my
hand
on
her
head,
in
token
of
approbation;
I
thought
Sylvie
was
going
to
smile,
her
dim
eye
almost
kindled;
but,
presently,
she
shrank
from
me;
I
was
a
man
and
a
heretic;
she,
poor
child!
a
destined
nun
and
devoted
Catholic:
thus
a
four
fold
wall
of
separation
divided
her
mind
from
mine.
A
pert
smirk,
and
a
hard
glance
of
triumph,
was
Leonie's
method
of
testifying
her
gratification;
Eulalie
looked
sullen
and
envious
she
had
hoped
to
be
first.
Hortense
and
Caroline
exchanged
a
reckless
grimace
on
hearing
their
names
read
out
somewhere
near
the
bottom
of
the
list;
the
brand
of
mental
inferiority
was
considered
by
them
as
no
disgrace,
their
hopes
for
the
future
being
based
solely
on
their
personal
attractions.
This
affair
arranged,
the
regular
lesson
followed.
During
a
brief
interval,
employed
by
the
pupils
in
ruling
their
books,
my
eye,
ranging
carelessly
over
the
benches,
observed,
for
the
first
time,
that
the
farthest
seat
in
the
farthest
row
a
seat
usually
vacant
was
again
filled
by
the
new
scholar,
the
Mdlle.
Henri
so
ostentatiously
recommended
to
me
by
the
directress.
To
day
I
had
on
my
spectacles;
her
appearance,
therefore,
was
clear
to
me
at
the
first
glance;
I
had
not
to
puzzle
over
it.
She
looked
young;
yet,
had
I
been
required
to
name
her
exact
age,
I
should
have
been
somewhat
nonplussed;
the
slightness
of
her
figure
might
have
suited
seventeen;
a
certain
anxious
and
pre
occupied
expression
of
face
seemed
the
indication
of
riper
years.
She
was
dressed,
like
all
the
rest,
in
a
dark
stuff
gown
and
a
white
collar;
her
features
were
dissimilar
to
any
there,
not
so
rounded,
more
defined,
yet
scarcely
regular.
The
shape
of
her
head
too
was
different,
the
superior
part
more
developed,
the
base
considerably
less.
I
felt
assured,
at
first
sight,
that
she
was
not
a
Belgian;
her
complexion,
her
countenance,
her
lineaments,
her
figure,
were
all
distinct
from
theirs,
and,
evidently,
the
type
of
another
race
of
a
race
less
gifted
with
fullness
of
flesh
and
plenitude
of
blood;
less
jocund,
material,
unthinking.
When
I
first
cast
my
eyes
on
her,
she
sat
looking
fixedly
down,
her
chin
resting
on
her
hand,
and
she
did
not
change
her
attitude
till
I
commenced
the
lesson.
None
of
the
Belgian
girls
would
have
retained
one
position,
and
that
a
reflective
one,
for
the
same
length
of
time.
Yet,
having
intimated
that
her
appearance
was
peculiar,
as
being
unlike
that
of
her
Flemish
companions,
I
have
little
more
to
say
respecting
it;
I
can
pronounce
no
encomiums
on
her
beauty,
for
she
was
not
beautiful;
nor
offer
condolence
on
her
plainness,
for
neither
was
she
plain;
a
careworn
character
of
forehead,
and
a
corresponding
moulding
of
the
mouth,
struck
me
with
a
sentiment
resembling
surprise,
but
these
traits
would
probably
have
passed
unnoticed
by
any
less
crotchety
observer.
Now,
reader,
though
I
have
spent
more
than
a
page
in
describing
Mdlle.
Henri,
I
know
well
enough
that
I
have
left
on
your
mind's
eye
no
distinct
picture
of
her;
I
have
not
painted
her
complexion,
nor
her
eyes,
nor
her
hair,
nor
even
drawn
the
outline
of
her
shape.
You
cannot
tell
whether
her
nose
was
aquiline
or
retrousse,
whether
her
chin
was
long
or
short,
her
face
square
or
oval;
nor
could
I
the
first
day,
and
it
is
not
my
intention
to
communicate
to
you
at
once
a
knowledge
I
myself
gained
by
little
and
little.
I
gave
a
short
exercise:
which
they
all
wrote
down.
I
saw
the
new
pupil
was
puzzled
at
first
with
the
novelty
of
the
form
and
language;
once
or
twice
she
looked
at
me
with
a
sort
of
painful
solicitude,
as
not
comprehending
at
all
what
I
meant;
then
she
was
not
ready
when
the
others
were,
she
could
not
write
her
phrases
so
fast
as
they
did;
I
would
not
help
her,
I
went
on
relentless.
She
looked
at
me;
her
eye
said
most
plainly,
"I
cannot
follow
you."
I
disregarded
the
appeal,
and,
carelessly
leaning
back
in
my
chair,
glancing
from
time
to
time
with
a
NONCHALANT
air
out
of
the
window,
I
dictated
a
little
faster.
On
looking
towards
her
again,
I
perceived
her
face
clouded
with
embarrassment,
but
she
was
still
writing
on
most
diligently;
I
paused
a
few
seconds;
she
employed
the
interval
in
hurriedly
re
perusing
what
she
had
written,
and
shame
and
discomfiture
were
apparent
in
her
countenance;
she
evidently
found
she
had
made
great
nonsense
of
it.
In
ten
minutes
more
the
dictation
was
complete,
and,
having
allowed
a
brief
space
in
which
to
correct
it,
I
took
their
books;
it
was
with
a
reluctant
hand
Mdlle.
Henri
gave
up
hers,
but,
having
once
yielded
it
to
my
possession,
she
composed
her
anxious
face,
as
if,
for
the
present
she
had
resolved
to
dismiss
regret,
and
had
made
up
her
mind
to
be
thought
unprecedentedly
stupid.
Glancing
over
her
exercise,
I
found
that
several
lines
had
been
omitted,
but
what
was
written
contained
very
few
faults;
I
instantly
inscribed
"Bon"
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
and
returned
it
to
her;
she
smiled,
at
first
incredulously,
then
as
if
reassured,
but
did
not
lift
her
eyes;
she
could
look
at
me,
it
seemed,
when
perplexed
and
bewildered,
but
not
when
gratified;
I
thought
that
scarcely
fair.
SOME
time
elapsed
before
I
again
gave
a
lesson
in
the
first
class;
the
holiday
of
Whitsuntide
occupied
three
days,
and
on
the
fourth
it
was
the
turn
of
the
second
division
to
receive
my
instructions.
As
I
made
the
transit
of
the
CARRE,
I
observed,
as
usual,
the
band
of
sewers
surrounding
Mdlle.
Henri;
there
were
only
about
a
dozen
of
them,
but
they
made
as
much
noise
as
might
have
sufficed
for
fifty;
they
seemed
very
little
under
her
control;
three
or
four
at
once
assailed
her
with
importunate
requirements;
she
looked
harassed,
she
demanded
silence,
but
in
vain.
She
saw
me,
and
I
read
in
her
eye
pain
that
a
stranger
should
witness
the
insubordination
of
her
pupils;
she
seemed
to
entreat
order
her
prayers
were
useless;
then
I
remarked
that
she
compressed
her
lips
and
contracted
her
brow;
and
her
countenance,
if
I
read
it
correctly,
said
"I
have
done
my
best;
I
seem
to
merit
blame
notwithstanding;
blame
me
then
who
will."
I
passed
on;
as
I
closed
the
school
room
door,
I
heard
her
say,
suddenly
and
sharply,
addressing
one
of
the
eldest
and
most
turbulent
of
the
lot
"Amelie
Mullenberg,
ask
me
no
question,
and
request
of
me
no
assistance,
for
a
week
to
come;
during
that
space
of
time
I
will
neither
speak
to
you
nor
help
you."
The
words
were
uttered
with
emphasis
nay,
with
vehemence
and
a
comparative
silence
followed;
whether
the
calm
was
permanent,
I
know
not;
two
doors
now
closed
between
me
and
the
CARRE.
Next
day
was
appropriated
to
the
first
class;
on
my
arrival,
I
found
the
directress
seated,
as
usual,
in
a
chair
between
the
two
estrades,
and
before
her
was
standing
Mdlle.
Henri,
in
an
attitude
(as
it
seemed
to
me)
of
somewhat
reluctant
attention.
The
directress
was
knitting
and
talking
at
the
same
time.
Amidst
the
hum
of
a
large
school
room,
it
was
easy
so
to
speak
in
the
ear
of
one
person,
as
to
be
heard
by
that
person
alone,
and
it
was
thus
Mdlle.
Reuter
parleyed
with
her
teacher.
The
face
of
the
latter
was
a
little
flushed,
not
a
little
troubled;
there
was
vexation
in
it,
whence
resulting
I
know
not,
for
the
directress
looked
very
placid
indeed;
she
could
not
be
scolding
in
such
gentle
whispers,
and
with
so
equable
a
mien;
no,
it
was
presently
proved
that
her
discourse
had
been
of
the
most
friendly
tendency,
for
I
heard
the
closing
words
"C'est
assez,
ma
bonne
amie;
a
present
je
ne
veux
pas
vous
retenir
davantage."
Without
reply,
Mdlle.
Henri
turned
away;
dissatisfaction
was
plainly
evinced
in
her
face,
and
a
smile,
slight
and
brief,
but
bitter,
distrustful,
and,
I
thought,
scornful,
curled
her
lip
as
she
took
her
place
in
the
class;
it
was
a
secret,
involuntary
smile,
which
lasted
but
a
second;
an
air
of
depression
succeeded,
chased
away
presently
by
one
of
attention
and
interest,
when
I
gave
the
word
for
all
the
pupils
to
take
their
reading
books.
In
general
I
hated
the
reading
lesson,
it
was
such
a
torture
to
the
ear
to
listen
to
their
uncouth
mouthing
of
my
native
tongue,
and
no
effort
of
example
or
precept
on
my
part
ever
seemed
to
effect
the
slightest
improvement
in
their
accent.
To
day,
each
in
her
appropriate
key,
lisped,
stuttered,
mumbled,
and
jabbered
as
usual;
about
fifteen
had
racked
me
in
turn,
and
my
auricular
nerve
was
expecting
with
resignation
the
discords
of
the
sixteenth,
when
a
full,
though
low
voice,
read
out,
in
clear
correct
English.
"On
his
way
to
Perth,
the
king
was
met
by
a
Highland
woman,
calling
herself
a
prophetess;
she
stood
at
the
side
of
the
ferry
by
which
he
was
about
to
travel
to
the
north,
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice,
'My
lord
the
king,
if
you
pass
this
water
you
will
never
return
again
alive!'"
(VIDE
the
HISTORY
OF
SCOTLAND).
I
looked
up
in
amazement;
the
voice
was
a
voice
of
Albion;
the
accent
was
pure
and
silvery;
it
only
wanted
firmness,
and
assurance,
to
be
the
counterpart
of
what
any
well
educated
lady
in
Essex
or
Middlesex
might
have
enounced,
yet
the
speaker
or
reader
was
no
other
than
Mdlle.
Henri,
in
whose
grave,
joyless
face
I
saw
no
mark
of
consciousness
that
she
had
performed
any
extraordinary
feat.
No
one
else
evinced
surprise
either.
Mdlle.
Reuter
knitted
away
assiduously;
I
was
aware,
however,
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
paragraph,
she
had
lifted
her
eyelid
and
honoured
me
with
a
glance
sideways;
she
did
not
know
the
full
excellency
of
the
teacher's
style
of
reading,
but
she
perceived
that
her
accent
was
not
that
of
the
others,
and
wanted
to
discover
what
I
thought;
I
masked
my
visage
with
indifference,
and
ordered
the
next
girl
to
proceed.
When
the
lesson
was
over,
I
took
advantage
of
the
confusion
caused
by
breaking
up,
to
approach
Mdlle.
Henri;
she
was
standing
near
the
window
and
retired
as
I
advanced;
she
thought
I
wanted
to
look
out,
and
did
not
imagine
that
I
could
have
anything
to
say
to
her.
I
took
her
exercise
book
out
of
her
hand;
as
I
turned
over
the
leaves
I
addressed
her:
"You
have
had
lessons
in
English
before?"
I
asked.
"No,
sir."
"No!
you
read
it
well;
you
have
been
in
England?"
"Oh,
no!"
with
some
animation.
"You
have
been
in
English
families?"
Still
the
answer
was
"No."
Here
my
eye,
resting
on
the
flyleaf
of
the
book,
saw
written,
"Frances
Evan
Henri."
"Your
name?"
I
asked
"Yes,
sir."
My
interrogations
were
cut
short;
I
heard
a
little
rustling
behind
me,
and
close
at
my
back
was
the
directress,
professing
to
be
examining
the
interior
of
a
desk.
"Mademoiselle,"
said
she,
looking
up
and
addressing
the
teacher,
"Will
you
have
the
goodness
to
go
and
stand
in
the
corridor,
while
the
young
ladies
are
putting
on
their
things,
and
try
to
keep
some
order?"
Mdlle.
Henri
obeyed.
"What
splendid
weather!"
observed
the
directress
cheerfully,
glancing
at
the
same
time
from
the
window.
I
assented
and
was
withdrawing.
"What
of
your
new
pupil,
monsieur?"
continued
she,
following
my
retreating
steps.
"Is
she
likely
to
make
progress
in
English?"
"Indeed
I
can
hardly
judge.
She
possesses
a
pretty
good
accent;
of
her
real
knowledge
of
the
language
I
have
as
yet
had
no
opportunity
of
forming
an
opinion."
"And
her
natural
capacity,
monsieur?
I
have
had
my
fears
about
that:
can
you
relieve
me
by
an
assurance
at
least
of
its
average
power?"
"I
see
no
reason
to
doubt
its
average
power,
mademoiselle,
but
really
I
scarcely
know
her,
and
have
not
had
time
to
study
the
calibre
of
her
capacity.
I
wish
you
a
very
good
afternoon."
She
still
pursued
me.
"You
will
observe,
monsieur,
and
tell
me
what
you
think;
I
could
so
much
better
rely
on
your
opinion
than
on
my
own;
women
cannot
judge
of
these
things
as
men
can,
and,
excuse
my
pertinacity,
monsieur,
but
it
is
natural
I
should
feel
interested
about
this
poor
little
girl
(pauvre
petite);
she
has
scarcely
any
relations,
her
own
efforts
are
all
she
has
to
look
to,
her
acquirements
must
be
her
sole
fortune;
her
present
position
has
once
been
mine,
or
nearly
so;
it
is
then
but
natural
I
should
sympathize
with
her;
and
sometimes
when
I
see
the
difficulty
she
has
in
managing
pupils,
I
feel
quite
chagrined.
I
doubt
not
she
does
her
best,
her
intentions
are
excellent;
but,
monsieur,
she
wants
tact
and
firmness.
I
have
talked
to
her
on
the
subject,
but
I
am
not
fluent,
and
probably
did
not
express
myself
with
clearness;
she
never
appears
to
comprehend
me.
Now,
would
you
occasionally,
when
you
see
an
opportunity,
slip
in
a
word
of
advice
to
her
on
the
subject;
men
have
so
much
more
influence
than
women
have
they
argue
so
much
more
logically
than
we
do;
and
you,
monsieur,
in
particular,
have
so
paramount
a
power
of
making
yourself
obeyed;
a
word
of
advice
from
you
could
not
but
do
her
good;
even
if
she
were
sullen
and
headstrong
(which
I
hope
she
is
not),
she
would
scarcely
refuse
to
listen
to
you;
for
my
own
part,
I
can
truly
say
that
I
never
attend
one
of
your
lessons
without
deriving
benefit
from
witnessing
your
management
of
the
pupils.
The
other
masters
are
a
constant
source
of
anxiety
to
me;
they
cannot
impress
the
young
ladies
with
sentiments
of
respect,
nor
restrain
the
levity
natural
to
youth:
in
you,
monsieur,
I
feel
the
most
absolute
confidence;
try
then
to
put
this
poor
child
into
the
way
of
controlling
our
giddy,
high
spirited
Brabantoises.
But,
monsieur,
I
would
add
one
word
more;
don't
alarm
her
AMOUR
PROPRE;
beware
of
inflicting
a
wound
there.
I
reluctantly
admit
that
in
that
particular
she
is
blameably
some
would
say
ridiculously
susceptible.
I
fear
I
have
touched
this
sore
point
inadvertently,
and
she
cannot
get
over
it."
During
the
greater
part
of
this
harangue
my
hand
was
on
the
lock
of
the
outer
door;
I
now
turned
it.
"Au
revoir,
mademoiselle,"
said
I,
and
I
escaped.
I
saw
the
directress's
stock
of
words
was
yet
far
from
exhausted.
She
looked
after
me,
she
would
fain
have
detained
me
longer.
Her
manner
towards
me
had
been
altered
ever
since
I
had
begun
to
treat
her
with
hardness
and
indifference:
she
almost
cringed
to
me
on
every
occasion;
she
consulted
my
countenance
incessantly,
and
beset
me
with
innumerable
little
officious
attentions.
Servility
creates
despotism.
This
slavish
homage,
instead
of
softening
my
heart,
only
pampered
whatever
was
stern
and
exacting
in
its
mood.
The
very
circumstance
of
her
hovering
round
me
like
a
fascinated
bird,
seemed
to
transform
me
into
a
rigid
pillar
of
stone;
her
flatteries
irritated
my
scorn,
her
blandishments
confirmed
my
reserve.
At
times
I
wondered
what
she
meant
by
giving
herself
such
trouble
to
win
me,
when
the
more
profitable
Pelet
was
already
in
her
nets,
and
when,
too,
she
was
aware
that
I
possessed
her
secret,
for
I
had
not
scrupled
to
tell
her
as
much:
but
the
fact
is
that
as
it
was
her
nature
to
doubt
the
reality
and
under
value
the
worth
of
modesty,
affection,
disinterestedness
to
regard
these
qualities
as
foibles
of
character
so
it
was
equally
her
tendency
to
consider
pride,
hardness,
selfishness,
as
proofs
of
strength.
She
would
trample
on
the
neck
of
humility,
she
would
kneel
at
the
feet
of
disdain;
she
would
meet
tenderness
with
secret
contempt,
indifference
she
would
woo
with
ceaseless
assiduities.
Benevolence,
devotedness,
enthusiasm,
were
her
antipathies;
for
dissimulation
and
self
interest
she
had
a
preference
they
were
real
wisdom
in
her
eyes;
moral
and
physical
degradation,
mental
and
bodily
inferiority,
she
regarded
with
indulgence;
they
were
foils
capable
of
being
turned
to
good
account
as
set
offs
for
her
own
endowments.
To
violence,
injustice,
tyranny,
she
succumbed
they
were
her
natural
masters;
she
had
no
propensity
to
hate,
no
impulse
to
resist
them;
the
indignation
their
behests
awake
in
some
hearts
was
unknown
in
hers.
From
all
this
it
resulted
that
the
false
and
selfish
called
her
wise,
the
vulgar
and
debased
termed
her
charitable,
the
insolent
and
unjust
dubbed
her
amiable,
the
conscientious
and
benevolent
generally
at
first
accepted
as
valid
her
claim
to
be
considered
one
of
themselves;
but
ere
long
the
plating
of
pretension
wore
off,
the
real
material
appeared
below,
and
they
laid
her
aside
as
a
deception.
In
the
course
of
another
fortnight
I
had
seen
sufficient
of
Frances
Evans
Henri,
to
enable
me
to
form
a
more
definite
opinion
of
her
character.
I
found
her
possessed
in
a
somewhat
remarkable
degree
of
at
least
two
good
points,
viz.,
perseverance
and
a
sense
of
duty;
I
found
she
was
really
capable
of
applying
to
study,
of
contending
with
difficulties.
At
first
I
offered
her
the
same
help
which
I
had
always
found
it
necessary
to
confer
on
the
others;
I
began
with
unloosing
for
her
each
knotty
point,
but
I
soon
discovered
that
such
help
was
regarded
by
my
new
pupil
as
degrading;
she
recoiled
from
it
with
a
certain
proud
impatience.
Hereupon
I
appointed
her
long
lessons,
and
left
her
to
solve
alone
any
perplexities
they
might
present.
She
set
to
the
task
with
serious
ardour,
and
having
quickly
accomplished
one
labour,
eagerly
demanded
more.
So
much
for
her
perseverance;
as
to
her
sense
of
duty,
it
evinced
itself
thus:
she
liked
to
learn,
but
hated
to
teach;
her
progress
as
a
pupil
depended
upon
herself,
and
I
saw
that
on
herself
she
could
calculate
with
certainty;
her
success
as
a
teacher
rested
partly,
perhaps
chiefly,
upon
the
will
of
others;
it
cost
her
a
most
painful
effort
to
enter
into
conflict
with
this
foreign
will,
to
endeavour
to
bend
it
into
subjection
to
her
own;
for
in
what
regarded
people
in
general
the
action
of
her
will
was
impeded
by
many
scruples;
it
was
as
unembarrassed
as
strong
where
her
own
affairs
were
concerned,
and
to
it
she
could
at
any
time
subject
her
inclination,
if
that
inclination
went
counter
to
her
convictions
of
right;
yet
when
called
upon
to
wrestle
with
the
propensities,
the
habits,
the
faults
of
others,
of
children
especially,
who
are
deaf
to
reason,
and,
for
the
most
part,
insensate
to
persuasion,
her
will
sometimes
almost
refused
to
act;
then
came
in
the
sense
of
duty,
and
forced
the
reluctant
will
into
operation.
A
wasteful
expense
of
energy
and
labour
was
frequently
the
consequence;
Frances
toiled
for
and
with
her
pupils
like
a
drudge,
but
it
was
long
ere
her
conscientious
exertions
were
rewarded
by
anything
like
docility
on
their
part,
because
they
saw
that
they
had
power
over
her,
inasmuch
as
by
resisting
her
painful
attempts
to
convince,
persuade,
control
by
forcing
her
to
the
employment
of
coercive
measures
they
could
inflict
upon
her
exquisite
suffering.
Human
beings
human
children
especially
seldom
deny
themselves
the
pleasure
of
exercising
a
power
which
they
are
conscious
of
possessing,
even
though
that
power
consist
only
in
a
capacity
to
make
others
wretched;
a
pupil
whose
sensations
are
duller
than
those
of
his
instructor,
while
his
nerves
are
tougher
and
his
bodily
strength
perhaps
greater,
has
an
immense
advantage
over
that
instructor,
and
he
will
generally
use
it
relentlessly,
because
the
very
young,
very
healthy,
very
thoughtless,
know
neither
how
to
sympathize
nor
how
to
spare.
Frances,
I
fear,
suffered
much;
a
continual
weight
seemed
to
oppress
her
spirits;
I
have
said
she
did
not
live
in
the
house,
and
whether
in
her
own
abode,
wherever
that
might
be,
she
wore
the
same
preoccupied,
unsmiling,
sorrowfully
resolved
air
that
always
shaded
her
features
under
the
roof
of
Mdlle.
Reuter,
I
could
not
tell.
One
day
I
gave,
as
a
devoir,
the
trite
little
anecdote
of
Alfred
tending
cakes
in
the
herdsman's
hut,
to
be
related
with
amplifications.
A
singular
affair
most
of
the
pupils
made
of
it;
brevity
was
what
they
had
chiefly
studied;
the
majority
of
the
narratives
were
perfectly
unintelligible;
those
of
Sylvie
and
Leonie
Ledru
alone
pretended
to
anything
like
sense
and
connection.
Eulalie,
indeed,
had
hit,
upon
a
clever
expedient
for
at
once
ensuring
accuracy
and
saving
trouble;
she
had
obtained
access
somehow
to
an
abridged
history
of
England,
and
had
copied
the
anecdote
out
fair.
I
wrote
on
the
margin
of
her
production
"Stupid
and
deceitful,"
and
then
tore
it
down
the
middle.
Last
in
the
pile
of
single
leaved
devoirs,
I
found
one
of
several
sheets,
neatly
written
out
and
stitched
together;
I
knew
the
hand,
and
scarcely
needed
the
evidence
of
the
signature
"Frances
Evans
Henri"
to
confirm
my
conjecture
as
to
the
writer's
identity.
Night
was
my
usual
time
for
correcting
devoirs,
and
my
own
room
the
usual
scene
of
such
task
task
most
onerous
hitherto;
and
it
seemed
strange
to
me
to
feel
rising
within
me
an
incipient
sense
of
interest,
as
I
snuffed
the
candle
and
addressed
myself
to
the
perusal
of
the
poor
teacher's
manuscript.
"Now,"
thought
I,
"I
shall
see
a
glimpse
of
what
she
really
is;
I
shall
get
an
idea
of
the
nature
and
extent
of
her
powers;
not
that
she
can
be
expected
to
express
herself
well
in
a
foreign
tongue,
but
still,
if
she
has
any
mind,
here
will
be
a
reflection
of
it."
The
narrative
commenced
by
a
description
of
a
Saxon
peasant's
hut,
situated
within
the
confines
of
a
great,
leafless,
winter
forest;
it
represented
an
evening
in
December;
flakes
of
snow
were
falling,
and
the
herdsman
foretold
a
heavy
storm;
he
summoned
his
wife
to
aid
him
in
collecting
their
flock,
roaming
far
away
on
the
pastoral
banks
of
the
Thone;
he
warns
her
that
it
will
be
late
ere
they
return.
The
good
woman
is
reluctant
to
quit
her
occupation
of
baking
cakes
for
the
evening
meal;
but
acknowledging
the
primary
importance
of
securing
the
herds
and
flocks,
she
puts
on
her
sheep
skin
mantle;
and,
addressing
a
stranger
who
rests
half
reclined
on
a
bed
of
rushes
near
the
hearth,
bids
him
mind
the
bread
till
her
return.
"Take
care,
young
man,"
she
continues,
"that
you
fasten
the
door
well
after
us;
and,
above
all,
open
to
none
in
our
absence;
whatever
sound
you
hear,
stir
not,
and
look
not
out.
The
night
will
soon
fall;
this
forest
is
most
wild
and
lonely;
strange
noises
are
often
heard
therein
after
sunset;
wolves
haunt
these
glades,
and
Danish
warriors
infest
the
country;
worse
things
are
talked
of;
you
might
chance
to
hear,
as
it
were,
a
child
cry,
and
on
opening
the
door
to
afford
it
succour,
a
greet
black
bull,
or
a
shadowy
goblin
dog,
might
rush
over
the
threshold;
or,
more
awful
still,
if
something
flapped,
as
with
wings,
against
the
lattice,
and
then
a
raven
or
a
white
dove
flew
in
and
settled
on
the
hearth,
such
a
visitor
would
be
a
sure
sign
of
misfortune
to
the
house;
therefore,
heed
my
advice,
and
lift
the
latchet
for
nothing."
Her
husband
calls
her
away,
both
depart.
The
stranger,
left
alone,
listens
awhile
to
the
muffled
snow
wind,
the
remote,
swollen
sound
of
the
river,
and
then
he
speaks.
"It
is
Christmas
Eve,"
says
he,
"I
mark
the
date;
here
I
sit
alone
on
a
rude
couch
of
rushes,
sheltered
by
the
thatch
of
a
herdsman's
hut;
I,
whose
inheritance
was
a
kingdom,
owe
my
night's
harbourage
to
a
poor
serf;
my
throne
is
usurped,
my
crown
presses
the
brow
of
an
invader;
I
have
no
friends;
my
troops
wander
broken
in
the
hills
of
Wales;
reckless
robbers
spoil
my
country;
my
subjects
lie
prostrate,
their
breasts
crushed
by
the
heel
of
the
brutal
Dane.
Fate!
thou
hast
done
thy
worst,
and
now
thou
standest
before
me
resting
thy
hand
on
thy
blunted
blade.
Ay;
I
see
thine
eye
confront
mine
and
demand
why
I
still
live,
why
I
still
hope.
Pagan
demon,
I
credit
not
thine
omnipotence,
and
so
cannot
succumb
to
thy
power.
My
God,
whose
Son,
as
on
this
night,
took
on
Him
the
form
of
man,
and
for
man
vouchsafed
to
suffer
and
bleed,
controls
thy
hand,
and
without
His
behest
thou
canst
not
strike
a
stroke.
My
God
is
sinless,
eternal,
all
wise
in
Him
is
my
trust;
and
though
stripped
and
crushed
by
thee
though
naked,
desolate,
void
of
resource
I
do
not
despair,
I
cannot
despair:
were
the
lance
of
Guthrum
now
wet
with
my
blood,
I
should
not
despair.
I
watch,
I
toil,
I
hope,
I
pray;
Jehovah,
in
his
own
time,
will
aid."
I
need
not
continue
the
quotation;
the
whole
devoir
was
in
the
same
strain.
There
were
errors
of
orthography,
there
were
foreign
idioms,
there
were
some
faults
of
construction,
there
were
verbs
irregular
transformed
into
verbs
regular;
it
was
mostly
made
up,
as
the
above
example
shows,
of
short
and
somewhat
rude
sentences,
and
the
style
stood
in
great
need
of
polish
and
sustained
dignity;
yet
such
as
it
was,
I
had
hitherto
seen
nothing
like
it
in
the
course
of
my
professorial
experience.
The
girl's
mind
had
conceived
a
picture
of
the
hut,
of
the
two
peasants,
of
the
crownless
king;
she
had
imagined
the
wintry
forest,
she
had
recalled
the
old
Saxon
ghost
legends,
she
had
appreciated
Alfred's
courage
under
calamity,
she
had
remembered
his
Christian
education,
and
had
shown
him,
with
the
rooted
confidence
of
those
primitive
days,
relying
on
the
scriptural
Jehovah
for
aid
against
the
mythological
Destiny.
This
she
had
done
without
a
hint
from
me:
I
had
given
the
subject,
but
not
said
a
word
about
the
manner
of
treating
it.
"I
will
find,
or
make,
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her,"
I
said
to
myself
as
I
rolled
the
devoir
up;
"I
will
learn
what
she
has
of
English
in
her
besides
the
name
of
Frances
Evans;
she
is
no
novice
in
the
language,
that
is
evident,
yet
she
told
me
she
had
neither
been
in
England,
nor
taken
lessons
in
English,
nor
lived
in
English
families."
In
the
course
of
my
next
lesson,
I
made
a
report
of
the
other
devoirs,
dealing
out
praise
and
blame
in
very
small
retail
parcels,
according
to
my
custom,
for
there
was
no
use
in
blaming
severely,
and
high
encomiums
were
rarely
merited.
I
said
nothing
of
Mdlle.
Henri's
exercise,
and,
spectacles
on
nose,
I
endeavoured
to
decipher
in
her
countenance
her
sentiments
at
the
omission.
I
wanted
to
find
out
whether
in
her
existed
a
consciousness
of
her
own
talents.
"If
she
thinks
she
did
a
clever
thing
in
composing
that
devoir,
she
will
now
look
mortified,"
thought
I.
Grave
as
usual,
almost
sombre,
was
her
face;
as
usual,
her
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
cahier
open
before
her;
there
was
something,
I
thought,
of
expectation
in
her
attitude,
as
I
concluded
a
brief
review
of
the
last
devoir,
and
when,
casting
it
from
me
and
rubbing
my
hands,
I
bade
them
take
their
grammars,
some
slight
change
did
pass
over
her
air
and
mien,
as
though
she
now
relinquished
a
faint
prospect
of
pleasant
excitement;
she
had
been
waiting
for
something
to
be
discussed
in
which
she
had
a
degree
of
interest;
the
discussion
was
not
to
come
on,
so
expectation
sank
back,
shrunk
and
sad,
but
attention,
promptly
filling
up
the
void,
repaired
in
a
moment
the
transient
collapse
of
feature;
still,
I
felt,
rather
than
saw,
during
the
whole
course
of
the
lesson,
that
a
hope
had
been
wrenched
from
her,
and
that
if
she
did
not
show
distress,
it
was
because
she
would
not.
At
four
o'clock,
when
the
bell
rang
and
the
room
was
in
immediate
tumult,
instead
of
taking
my
hat
and
starting
from
the
estrade,
I
sat
still
a
moment.
I
looked
at
Frances,
she
was
putting
her
books
into
her
cabas;
having
fastened
the
button,
she
raised
her
head;
encountering
my
eye,
she
made
a
quiet,
respectful
obeisance,
as
bidding
good
afternoon,
and
was
turning
to
depart:
"Come
here,"
said
I,
lifting
my
finger
at
the
same
time.
She
hesitated;
she
could
not
hear
the
words
amidst
the
uproar
now
pervading
both
school
rooms;
I
repeated
the
sign;
she
approached;
again
she
paused
within
half
a
yard
of
the
estrade,
and
looked
shy,
and
still
doubtful
whether
she
had
mistaken
my
meaning.
"Step
up,"
I
said,
speaking
with
decision.
It
is
the
only
way
of
dealing
with
diffident,
easily
embarrassed
characters,
and
with
some
slight
manual
aid
I
presently
got
her
placed
just
where
I
wanted
her
to
be,
that
is,
between
my
desk
and
the
window,
where
she
was
screened
from
the
rush
of
the
second
division,
and
where
no
one
could
sneak
behind
her
to
listen.
"Take
a
seat,"
I
said,
placing
a
tabouret;
and
I
made
her
sit
down.
I
knew
what
I
was
doing
would
be
considered
a
very
strange
thing,
and,
what
was
more,
I
did
not
care.
Frances
knew
it
also,
and,
I
fear,
by
an
appearance
of
agitation
and
trembling,
that
she
cared
much.
I
drew
from
my
pocket
the
rolled
up
devoir.
"This
is
yours,
I
suppose?"
said
I,
addressing
her
in
English,
for
I
now
felt
sure
she
could
speak
English.
"Yes,"
she
answered
distinctly;
and
as
I
unrolled
it
and
laid
it
out
flat
on
the
desk
before
her
with
my
hand
upon
it,
and
a
pencil
in
that
hand,
I
saw
her
moved,
and,
as
it
were,
kindled;
her
depression
beamed
as
a
cloud
might
behind
which
the
sun
is
burning.
"This
devoir
has
numerous
faults,"
said
I.
"It
will
take
you
some
years
of
careful
study
before
you
are
in
a
condition
to
write
English
with
absolute
correctness.
Attend:
I
will
point
out
some
principal
defects."
And
I
went
through
it
carefully,
noting
every
error,
and
demonstrating
why
they
were
errors,
and
how
the
words
or
phrases
ought
to
have
been
written.
In
the
course
of
this
sobering
process
she
became
calm.
I
now
went
on:
"As
to
the
substance
of
your
devoir,
Mdlle.
Henri,
it
has
surprised
me;
I
perused
it
with
pleasure,
because
I
saw
in
it
some
proofs
of
taste
and
fancy.
Taste
and
fancy
are
not
the
highest
gifts
of
the
human
mind,
but
such
as
they
are
you
possess
them
not
probably
in
a
paramount
degree,
but
in
a
degree
beyond
what
the
majority
can
boast.
You
may
then
take
courage;
cultivate
the
faculties
that
God
and
nature
have
bestowed
on
you,
and
do
not
fear
in
any
crisis
of
suffering,
under
any
pressure
of
injustice,
to
derive
free
and
full
consolation
from
the
consciousness
of
their
strength
and
rarity."
"Strength
and
rarity!"
I
repeated
to
myself;
"ay,
the
words
are
probably
true,"
for
on
looking
up,
I
saw
the
sun
had
dissevered
its
screening
cloud,
her
countenance
was
transfigured,
a
smile
shone
in
her
eyes
a
smile
almost
triumphant;
it
seemed
to
say
"I
am
glad
you
have
been
forced
to
discover
so
much
of
my
nature;
you
need
not
so
carefully
moderate
your
language.
