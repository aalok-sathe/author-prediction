and
I
will
tell
you
what
she
is
like.
She
is
like
what
Eve
was
when
she
and
Adam
stood
alone
on
earth."
"And
that
is
not
Milton's
Eve,
Shirley."
"Milton's
Eve!
Milton's
Eve!
I
repeat.
No,
by
the
pure
Mother
of
God,
she
is
not!
Cary,
we
are
alone;
we
may
speak
what
we
think.
Milton
was
great;
but
was
he
good?
His
brain
was
right;
how
was
his
heart?
He
saw
heaven;
he
looked
down
on
hell.
He
saw
Satan,
and
Sin
his
daughter,
and
Death
their
horrible
offspring.
Angels
serried
before
him
their
battalions;
the
long
lines
of
adamantine
shields
flashed
back
on
his
blind
eyeballs
the
unutterable
splendour
of
heaven.
Devils
gathered
their
legions
in
his
sight;
their
dim,
discrowned,
and
tarnished
armies
passed
rank
and
file
before
him.
Milton
tried
to
see
the
first
woman;
but,
Cary,
he
saw
her
not."
"You
are
bold
to
say
so,
Shirley."
"Not
more
bold
than
faithful.
It
was
his
cook
that
he
saw;
or
it
was
Mrs.
Gill,
as
I
have
seen
her,
making
custards,
in
the
heat
of
summer,
in
the
cool
dairy,
with
rose
trees
and
nasturtiums
about
the
latticed
window,
preparing
a
cold
collation
for
the
rectors
preserves
and
'dulcet
creams;'
puzzled
'what
choice
to
choose
for
delicacy
best;
what
order
so
contrived
as
not
to
mix
tastes,
not
well
joined,
inelegant,
but
bring
taste
after
taste,
upheld
with
kindliest
change.'"
"All
very
well
too,
Shirley."
"I
would
beg
to
remind
him
that
the
first
men
of
the
earth
were
Titans,
and
that
Eve
was
their
mother;
from
her
sprang
Saturn,
Hyperion,
Oceanus;
she
bore
Prometheus
"
"Pagan
that
you
are!
what
does
that
signify?"
"I
say,
there
were
giants
on
the
earth
in
those
days
giants
that
strove
to
scale
heaven.
The
first
woman's
breast
that
heaved
with
life
on
this
world
yielded
the
daring
which
could
contend
with
Omnipotence,
the
strength
which
could
bear
a
thousand
years
of
bondage,
the
vitality
which
could
feed
that
vulture
death
through
uncounted
ages,
the
unexhausted
life
and
uncorrupted
excellence,
sisters
to
immortality,
which,
after
millenniums
of
crimes,
struggles,
and
woes,
could
conceive
and
bring
forth
a
Messiah.
The
first
woman
was
heaven
born.
Vast
was
the
heart
whence
gushed
the
well
spring
of
the
blood
of
nations,
and
grand
the
undegenerate
head
where
rested
the
consort
crown
of
creation."
"She
coveted
an
apple,
and
was
cheated
by
a
snake;
but
you
have
got
such
a
hash
of
Scripture
and
mythology
into
your
head
that
there
is
no
making
any
sense
of
you.
You
have
not
yet
told
me
what
you
saw
kneeling
on
those
hills."
"I
saw
I
now
see
a
woman
Titan.
Her
robe
of
blue
air
spreads
to
the
outskirts
of
the
heath,
where
yonder
flock
is
grazing;
a
veil
white
as
an
avalanche
sweeps
from
her
head
to
her
feet,
and
arabesques
of
lightning
flame
on
its
borders.
Under
her
breast
I
see
her
zone,
purple
like
that
horizon;
through
its
blush
shines
the
star
of
evening.
Her
steady
eyes
I
cannot
picture.
They
are
clear,
they
are
deep
as
lakes,
they
are
lifted
and
full
of
worship,
they
tremble
with
the
softness
of
love
and
the
lustre
of
prayer.
Her
forehead
has
the
expanse
of
a
cloud,
and
is
paler
than
the
early
moon,
risen
long
before
dark
gathers.
She
reclines
her
bosom
on
the
ridge
of
Stilbro'
Moor;
her
mighty
hands
are
joined
beneath
it.
So
kneeling,
face
to
face
she
speaks
with
God.
That
Eve
is
Jehovah's
daughter,
as
Adam
was
His
son."
"She
is
very
vague
and
visionary.
Come,
Shirley,
we
ought
to
go
into
church."
"Caroline,
I
will
not;
I
will
stay
out
here
with
my
mother
Eve,
in
these
days
called
Nature.
I
love
her
undying,
mighty
being!
Heaven
may
have
faded
from
her
brow
when
she
fell
in
paradise,
but
all
that
is
glorious
on
earth
shines
there
still.
She
is
taking
me
to
her
bosom,
and
showing
me
her
heart.
Hush,
Caroline!
You
will
see
her
and
feel
as
I
do,
if
we
are
both
silent."
"I
will
humour
your
whim;
but
you
will
begin
talking
again
ere
ten
minutes
are
over."
Miss
Keeldar,
on
whom
the
soft
excitement
of
the
warm
summer
evening
seemed
working
with
unwonted
power,
leaned
against
an
upright
headstone;
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
deep
burning
west,
and
sank
into
a
pleasurable
trance.
Caroline,
going
a
little
apart,
paced
to
and
fro
beneath
the
rectory
garden
wall,
dreaming
too
in
her
way.
Shirley
had
mentioned
the
word
"mother."
That
word
suggested
to
Caroline's
imagination
not
the
mighty
and
mystical
parent
of
Shirley's
visions,
but
a
gentle
human
form
the
form
she
ascribed
to
her
own
mother,
unknown,
unloved,
but
not
unlonged
for.
"Oh
that
the
day
would
come
when
she
would
remember
her
child!
Oh
that
I
might
know
her,
and
knowing,
love
her!"
Such
was
her
aspiration.
The
longing
of
her
childhood
filled
her
soul
again.
The
desire
which
many
a
night
had
kept
her
awake
in
her
crib,
and
which
fear
of
its
fallacy
had
of
late
years
almost
extinguished,
relit
suddenly,
and
glowed
warm
in
her
heart,
that
her
mother
might
come
some
happy
day,
and
send
for
her
to
her
presence,
look
upon
her
fondly
with
loving
eyes,
and
say
to
her
tenderly,
in
a
sweet
voice,
"Caroline,
my
child,
I
have
a
home
for
you;
you
shall
live
with
me.
All
the
love
you
have
needed,
and
not
tasted,
from
infancy,
I
have
saved
for
you
carefully.
Come;
it
shall
cherish
you
now."
A
noise
on
the
road
roused
Caroline
from
her
filial
hopes,
and
Shirley
from
her
Titan
visions.
They
listened,
and
heard
the
tramp
of
horses.
They
looked,
and
saw
a
glitter
through
the
trees.
They
caught
through
the
foliage
glimpses
of
martial
scarlet;
helm
shone,
plume
waved.
Silent
and
orderly,
six
soldiers
rode
softly
by.
"The
same
we
saw
this
afternoon,"
whispered
Shirley.
"They
have
been
halting
somewhere
till
now.
They
wish
to
be
as
little
noticed
as
possible,
and
are
seeking
their
rendezvous
at
this
quiet
hour,
while
the
people
are
at
church.
Did
I
not
say
we
should
see
unusual
things
ere
long?"
Scarcely
were
sight
and
sound
of
the
soldiers
lost,
when
another
and
somewhat
different
disturbance
broke
the
night
hush
a
child's
impatient
scream.
They
looked.
A
man
issued
from
the
church,
carrying
in
his
arms
an
infant
a
robust,
ruddy
little
boy
of
some
two
years
old
roaring
with
all
the
power
of
his
lungs.
He
had
probably
just
awaked
from
a
church
sleep.
Two
little
girls,
of
nine
and
ten,
followed.
The
influence
of
the
fresh
air,
and
the
attraction
of
some
flowers
gathered
from
a
grave,
soon
quieted
the
child.
The
man
sat
down
with
him,
dandling
him
on
his
knee
as
tenderly
as
any
woman;
the
two
little
girls
took
their
places
one
on
each
side.
"Good
evening,
William,"
said
Shirley,
after
due
scrutiny
of
the
man.
He
had
seen
her
before,
and
apparently
was
waiting
to
be
recognized.
He
now
took
off
his
hat,
and
grinned
a
smile
of
pleasure.
He
was
a
rough
headed,
hard
featured
personage,
not
old,
but
very
weather
beaten.
His
attire
was
decent
and
clean;
that
of
his
children
singularly
neat.
It
was
our
old
friend
Farren.
The
young
ladies
approached
him.
"You
are
not
going
into
the
church?"
he
inquired,
gazing
at
them
complacently,
yet
with
a
mixture
of
bashfulness
in
his
look
a
sentiment
not
by
any
means
the
result
of
awe
of
their
station,
but
only
of
appreciation
of
their
elegance
and
youth.
Before
gentlemen
such
as
Moore
or
Helstone,
for
instance
William
was
often
a
little
dogged;
with
proud
or
insolent
ladies,
too,
he
was
quite
unmanageable,
sometimes
very
resentful;
but
he
was
most
sensible
of,
most
tractable
to,
good
humour
and
civility.
His
nature
a
stubborn
one
was
repelled
by
inflexibility
in
other
natures;
for
which
reason
he
had
never
been
able
to
like
his
former
master,
Moore;
and
unconscious
of
that
gentleman's
good
opinion
of
himself,
and
of
the
service
he
had
secretly
rendered
him
in
recommending
him
as
gardener
to
Mr.
Yorke,
and
by
this
means
to
other
families
in
the
neighbourhood,
he
continued
to
harbour
a
grudge
against
his
austerity.
Latterly
he
had
often
worked
at
Fieldhead.
Miss
Keeldar's
frank,
hospitable
manners
were
perfectly
charming
to
him.
Caroline
he
had
known
from
her
childhood;
unconsciously
she
was
his
ideal
of
a
lady.
Her
gentle
mien,
step,
gestures,
her
grace
of
person
and
attire,
moved
some
artist
fibres
about
his
peasant
heart.
He
had
a
pleasure
in
looking
at
her,
as
he
had
in
examining
rare
flowers
or
in
seeing
pleasant
landscapes.
Both
the
ladies
liked
William;
it
was
their
delight
to
lend
him
books,
to
give
him
plants;
and
they
preferred
his
conversation
far
before
that
of
many
coarse,
hard,
pretentious
people
immeasurably
higher
in
station.
"Who
was
speaking,
William,
when
you
came
out?"
asked
Shirley.
"A
gentleman
ye
set
a
deal
of
store
on,
Miss
Shirley
Mr.
Donne."
"You
look
knowing,
William.
How
did
you
find
out
my
regard
for
Mr.
Donne?"
"Ay,
Miss
Shirley,
there's
a
gleg
light
i'
your
een
sometimes
which
betrays
you.
You
look
raight
down
scornful
sometimes
when
Mr.
Donne
is
by."
"Do
you
like
him
yourself,
William?"
"Me?
I'm
stalled
o'
t'
curates,
and
so
is
t'
wife.
They've
no
manners.
They
talk
to
poor
folk
fair
as
if
they
thought
they
were
beneath
them.
They're
allus
magnifying
their
office.
It
is
a
pity
but
their
office
could
magnify
them;
but
it
does
nought
o'
t'
soart.
I
fair
hate
pride."
"But
you
are
proud
in
your
own
way
yourself,"
interposed
Caroline.
"You
are
what
you
call
house
proud:
you
like
to
have
everything
handsome
about
you.
Sometimes
you
look
as
if
you
were
almost
too
proud
to
take
your
wages.
When
you
were
out
of
work,
you
were
too
proud
to
get
anything
on
credit.
But
for
your
children,
I
believe
you
would
rather
have
starved
than
gone
to
the
shops
without
money;
and
when
I
wanted
to
give
you
something,
what
a
difficulty
I
had
in
making
you
take
it!"
"It
is
partly
true,
Miss
Caroline.
Ony
day
I'd
rather
give
than
take,
especially
from
sich
as
ye.
Look
at
t'
difference
between
us.
Ye're
a
little,
young,
slender
lass,
and
I'm
a
great
strong
man;
I'm
rather
more
nor
twice
your
age.
It
is
not
my
part,
then,
I
think,
to
tak
fro'
ye
to
be
under
obligations
(as
they
say)
to
ye.
And
that
day
ye
came
to
our
house,
and
called
me
to
t'
door,
and
offered
me
five
shillings,
which
I
doubt
ye
could
ill
spare
for
ye've
no
fortin',
I
know
that
day
I
war
fair
a
rebel,
a
radical,
an
insurrectionist;
and
ye
made
me
so.
I
thought
it
shameful
that,
willing
and
able
as
I
was
to
work,
I
suld
be
i'
such
a
condition
that
a
young
cratur
about
the
age
o'
my
own
eldest
lass
suld
think
it
needful
to
come
and
offer
me
her
bit
o'
brass."
"I
suppose
you
were
angry
with
me,
William?"
"I
almost
was,
in
a
way.
But
I
forgave
ye
varry
soon.
Ye
meant
well.
Ay,
I
am
proud,
and
so
are
ye;
but
your
pride
and
mine
is
t'
raight
mak
what
we
call
i'
Yorkshire
clean
pride
such
as
Mr.
Malone
and
Mr.
Donne
knows
nought
about.
Theirs
is
mucky
pride.
Now,
I
shall
teach
my
lasses
to
be
as
proud
as
Miss
Shirley
there,
and
my
lads
to
be
as
proud
as
myseln;
but
I
dare
ony
o'
'em
to
be
like
t'
curates.
I'd
lick
little
Michael
if
I
seed
him
show
any
signs
o'
that
feeling."
"What
is
the
difference,
William?"
"Ye
know
t'
difference
weel
enow,
but
ye
want
me
to
get
a
gate
o'
talking.
Mr.
Malone
and
Mr.
Donne
is
almost
too
proud
to
do
aught
for
theirseln;
we
are
almost
too
proud
to
let
anybody
do
aught
for
us.
T'
curates
can
hardly
bide
to
speak
a
civil
word
to
them
they
think
beneath
them;
we
can
hardly
bide
to
tak
an
uncivil
word
fro'
them
that
thinks
themseln
aboon
us."
"Now,
William,
be
humble
enough
to
tell
me
truly
how
you
are
getting
on
in
the
world.
Are
you
well
off?"
"Miss
Shirley,
I
am
varry
well
off.
Since
I
got
into
t'
gardening
line,
wi'
Mr.
Yorke's
help,
and
since
Mr.
Hall
(another
o'
t'
raight
sort)
helped
my
wife
to
set
up
a
bit
of
a
shop,
I've
nought
to
complain
of.
My
family
has
plenty
to
eat
and
plenty
to
wear.
My
pride
makes
me
find
means
to
have
an
odd
pound
now
and
then
against
rainy
days;
for
I
think
I'd
die
afore
I'd
come
to
t'
parish;
and
me
and
mine
is
content.
But
t'
neighbours
is
poor
yet.
I
see
a
great
deal
of
distress."
"And,
consequently,
there
is
still
discontent,
I
suppose?"
inquired
Miss
Keeldar.
"Consequently
ye
say
right
consequently.
In
course,
starving
folk
cannot
be
satisfied
or
settled
folk.
The
country's
not
in
a
safe
condition
I'll
say
so
mich!"
"But
what
can
be
done?
What
more
can
I
do,
for
instance?"
"Do?
Ye
can
do
not
mich,
poor
young
lass!
Ye've
gi'en
your
brass;
ye've
done
well.
If
ye
could
transport
your
tenant,
Mr.
Moore,
to
Botany
Bay,
ye'd
happen
do
better.
Folks
hate
him."
"William,
for
shame!"
exclaimed
Caroline
warmly.
"If
folks
do
hate
him,
it
is
to
their
disgrace,
not
his.
Mr.
Moore
himself
hates
nobody.
He
only
wants
to
do
his
duty,
and
maintain
his
rights.
You
are
wrong
to
talk
so."
"I
talk
as
I
think.
He
has
a
cold,
unfeeling
heart,
yond'
Moore."
"But,"
interposed
Shirley,
"supposing
Moore
was
driven
from
the
country,
and
his
mill
razed
to
the
ground,
would
people
have
more
work?"
"They'd
have
less.
I
know
that,
and
they
know
that;
and
there
is
many
an
honest
lad
driven
desperate
by
the
certainty
that
whichever
way
he
turns
he
cannot
better
himself;
and
there
is
dishonest
men
plenty
to
guide
them
to
the
devil,
scoundrels
that
reckons
to
be
the
'people's
friends,'
and
that
knows
nought
about
the
people,
and
is
as
insincere
as
Lucifer.
I've
lived
aboon
forty
year
in
the
world,
and
I
believe
that
'the
people'
will
never
have
any
true
friends
but
theirseln
and
them
two
or
three
good
folk
i'
different
stations
that
is
friends
to
all
the
world.
Human
natur',
taking
it
i'
th'
lump,
is
nought
but
selfishness.
It
is
but
excessive
few,
it
is
but
just
an
exception
here
and
there,
now
and
then,
sich
as
ye
two
young
uns
and
me,
that,
being
in
a
different
sphere,
can
understand
t'
one
t'
other,
and
be
friends
wi'out
slavishness
o'
one
hand
or
pride
o'
t'
other.
Them
that
reckons
to
be
friends
to
a
lower
class
than
their
own
fro'
political
motives
is
never
to
be
trusted;
they
always
try
to
make
their
inferiors
tools.
For
my
own
part,
I
will
neither
be
patronized
nor
misled
for
no
man's
pleasure.
I've
had
overtures
made
to
me
lately
that
I
saw
were
treacherous,
and
I
flung
'em
back
i'
the
faces
o'
them
that
offered
'em."
"You
won't
tell
us
what
overtures?"
"I
will
not.
It
would
do
no
good.
It
would
mak
no
difference.
Them
they
concerned
can
look
after
theirseln."
"Ay,
we'se
look
after
werseln,"
said
another
voice.
Joe
Scott
had
sauntered
forth
from
the
church
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air,
and
there
he
stood.
"I'll
warrant
ye,
Joe,"
observed
William,
smiling.
"And
I'll
warrant
my
maister,"
was
the
answer.
"Young
ladies,"
continued
Joe,
assuming
a
lordly
air,
"ye'd
better
go
into
th'
house."
"I
wonder
what
for?"
inquired
Shirley,
to
whom
the
overlooker's
somewhat
pragmatical
manners
were
familiar,
and
who
was
often
at
war
with
him;
for
Joe,
holding
supercilious
theories
about
women
in
general,
resented
greatly,
in
his
secret
soul,
the
fact
of
his
master
and
his
master's
mill
being,
in
a
manner,
under
petticoat
government,
and
had
felt
as
wormwood
and
gall
certain
business
visits
of
the
heiress
to
the
Hollow's
counting
house.
"Because
there
is
nought
agate
that
fits
women
to
be
consarned
in."
"Indeed!
There
is
prayer
and
preaching
agate
in
that
church.
Are
we
not
concerned
in
that?"
"Ye
have
been
present
neither
at
the
prayer
nor
preaching,
ma'am,
if
I
have
observed
aright.
What
I
alluded
to
was
politics.
William
Farren
here
was
touching
on
that
subject,
if
I'm
not
mista'en."
"Well,
what
then?
Politics
are
our
habitual
study,
Joe.
Do
you
know
I
see
a
newspaper
every
day,
and
two
of
a
Sunday?"
"I
should
think
you'll
read
the
marriages,
probably,
miss,
and
the
murders,
and
the
accidents,
and
sich
like?"
"I
read
the
leading
articles,
Joe,
and
the
foreign
intelligence,
and
I
look
over
the
market
prices.
In
short,
I
read
just
what
gentlemen
read."
Joe
looked
as
if
he
thought
this
talk
was
like
the
chattering
of
a
pie.
He
replied
to
it
by
a
disdainful
silence.
"Joe,"
continued
Miss
Keeldar,
"I
never
yet
could
ascertain
properly
whether
you
are
a
Whig
or
a
Tory.
Pray,
which
party
has
the
honour
of
your
alliance?"
"It
is
rayther
difficult
to
explain
where
you
are
sure
not
to
be
understood,"
was
Joe's
haughty
response;
"but
as
to
being
a
Tory,
I'd
as
soon
be
an
old
woman,
or
a
young
one,
which
is
a
more
flimsier
article
still.
It
is
the
Tories
that
carries
on
the
war
and
ruins
trade;
and
if
I
be
of
any
party
though
political
parties
is
all
nonsense
I'm
of
that
which
is
most
favourable
to
peace,
and,
by
consequence,
to
the
mercantile
interests
of
this
here
land."
"So
am
I,
Joe,"
replied
Shirley,
who
had
rather
a
pleasure
in
teasing
the
overlooker,
by
persisting
in
talking
on
subjects
with
which
he
opined
she,
as
a
woman,
had
no
right
to
meddle
"partly,
at
least.
I
have
rather
a
leaning
to
the
agricultural
interest,
too;
as
good
reason
is,
seeing
that
I
don't
desire
England
to
be
under
the
feet
of
France,
and
that
if
a
share
of
my
income
comes
from
Hollow's
Mill,
a
larger
share
comes
from
the
landed
estate
around
it.
It
would
not
do
to
take
any
measures
injurious
to
the
farmers,
Joe,
I
think?"
"The
dews
at
this
hour
is
unwholesome
for
females,"
observed
Joe.
"If
you
make
that
remark
out
of
interest
in
me,
I
have
merely
to
assure
you
that
I
am
impervious
to
cold.
I
should
not
mind
taking
my
turn
to
watch
the
mill
one
of
these
summer
nights,
armed
with
your
musket,
Joe."
Joe
Scott's
chin
was
always
rather
prominent.
He
poked
it
out,
at
this
speech,
some
inches
farther
than
usual.
"But
to
go
back
to
my
sheep,"
she
proceeded
"clothier
and
mill
owner
as
I
am,
besides
farmer,
I
cannot
get
out
of
my
head
a
certain
idea
that
we
manufacturers
and
persons
of
business
are
sometimes
a
little
a
very
little
selfish
and
short
sighted
in
our
views,
and
rather
too
regardless
of
human
suffering,
rather
heartless
in
our
pursuit
of
gain.
Don't
you
agree
with
me,
Joe?"
"I
cannot
argue
where
I
cannot
be
comprehended,"
was
again
the
answer.
"Man
of
mystery!
Your
master
will
argue
with
me
sometimes,
Joe.
He
is
not
so
stiff
as
you
are."
"Maybe
not.
We've
all
our
own
ways."
"Joe,
do
you
seriously
think
all
the
wisdom
in
the
world
is
lodged
in
male
skulls?"
"I
think
that
women
are
a
kittle
and
a
froward
generation;
and
I've
a
great
respect
for
the
doctrines
delivered
in
the
second
chapter
of
St.
Paul's
first
Epistle
to
Timothy."
"What
doctrines,
Joe?"
"'Let
the
woman
learn
in
silence,
with
all
subjection.
I
suffer
not
a
woman
to
teach,
nor
to
usurp
authority
over
the
man,
but
to
be
in
silence.
For
Adam
was
first
formed,
then
Eve.'"
"What
has
that
to
do
with
the
business?"
interjected
Shirley.
"That
smacks
of
rights
of
primogeniture.
I'll
bring
it
up
to
Mr.
Yorke
the
first
time
he
inveighs
against
those
rights."
"And,"
continued
Joe
Scott,
"Adam
was
not
deceived,
but
the
woman
being
deceived
was
in
the
transgression."
"More
shame
to
Adam
to
sin
with
his
eyes
open!"
cried
Miss
Keeldar.
"To
confess
the
honest
truth,
Joe,
I
never
was
easy
in
my
mind
concerning
that
chapter.
It
puzzles
me."
"It
is
very
plain,
miss.
He
that
runs
may
read."
"He
may
read
it
in
his
own
fashion,"
remarked
Caroline,
now
joining
in
the
dialogue
for
the
first
time.
"You
allow
the
right
of
private
judgment,
I
suppose,
Joe?"
"My
certy,
that
I
do!
I
allow
and
claim
it
for
every
line
of
the
holy
Book."
"Women
may
exercise
it
as
well
as
men?"
"Nay.
Women
is
to
take
their
husbands'
opinion,
both
in
politics
and
religion.
It's
wholesomest
for
them."
"Oh!
oh!"
exclaimed
both
Shirley
and
Caroline.
"To
be
sure;
no
doubt
on't,"
persisted
the
stubborn
overlooker.
"Consider
yourself
groaned
down,
and
cried
shame
over,
for
such
a
stupid
observation,"
said
Miss
Keeldar.
"You
might
as
well
say
men
are
to
take
the
opinions
of
their
priests
without
examination.
Of
what
value
would
a
religion
so
adopted
be?
It
would
be
mere
blind,
besotted
superstition."
"And
what
is
your
reading,
Miss
Helstone,
o'
these
words
o'
St.
Paul's?"
"Hem!
I
I
account
for
them
in
this
way.
He
wrote
that
chapter
for
a
particular
congregation
of
Christians,
under
peculiar
circumstances;
and
besides,
I
dare
say,
if
I
could
read
the
original
Greek,
I
should
find
that
many
of
the
words
have
been
wrongly
translated,
perhaps
misapprehended
altogether.
It
would
be
possible,
I
doubt
not,
with
a
little
ingenuity,
to
give
the
passage
quite
a
contrary
turn
to
make
it
say,
'Let
the
woman
speak
out
whenever
she
sees
fit
to
make
an
objection.'
'It
is
permitted
to
a
woman
to
teach
and
to
exercise
authority
as
much
as
may
be.
Man,
meantime,
cannot
do
better
than
hold
his
peace;'
and
so
on."
"That
willn't
wash,
miss."
"I
dare
say
it
will.
My
notions
are
dyed
in
faster
colours
than
yours,
Joe.
Mr.
Scott,
you
are
a
thoroughly
dogmatical
person,
and
always
were.
I
like
William
better
than
you."
"Joe
is
well
enough
in
his
own
house,"
said
Shirley.
"I
have
seen
him
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
at
home.
There
is
not
a
better
nor
a
kinder
husband
in
Briarfield.
He
does
not
dogmatize
to
his
wife."
"My
wife
is
a
hard
working,
plain
woman;
time
and
trouble
has
ta'en
all
the
conceit
out
of
her.
But
that
is
not
the
case
with
you,
young
misses.
And
then
you
reckon
to
have
so
much
knowledge;
and
i'
my
thoughts
it's
only
superficial
sort
o'
vanities
you're
acquainted
with.
I
can
tell
happen
a
year
sin'
one
day
Miss
Caroline
coming
into
our
counting
house
when
I
war
packing
up
summat
behind
t'
great
desk,
and
she
didn't
see
me,
and
she
brought
a
slate
wi'
a
sum
on
it
to
t'
maister.
It
war
only
a
bit
of
a
sum
in
practice,
that
our
Harry
would
have
settled
i'
two
minutes.
She
couldn't
do
it.
Mr.
Moore
had
to
show
her
how.
And
when
he
did
show
her,
she
couldn't
understand
him."
"Nonsense,
Joe!"
"Nay,
it's
no
nonsense.
And
Miss
Shirley
there
reckons
to
hearken
to
t'
maister
when
he's
talking
ower
trade,
so
attentive
like,
as
if
she
followed
him
word
for
word,
and
all
war
as
clear
as
a
lady's
looking
glass
to
her
een;
and
all
t'
while
she's
peeping
and
peeping
out
o'
t'
window
to
see
if
t'
mare
stands
quiet;
and
then
looking
at
a
bit
of
a
splash
on
her
riding
skirt;
and
then
glancing
glegly
round
at
wer
counting
house
cobwebs
and
dust,
and
thinking
what
mucky
folk
we
are,
and
what
a
grand
ride
she'll
have
just
i'
now
ower
Nunnely
Common.
She
hears
no
more
o'
Mr.
Moore's
talk
nor
if
he
spake
Hebrew."
"Joe,
you
are
a
real
slanderer.
I
would
give
you
your
answer,
only
the
people
are
coming
out
of
church.
We
must
leave
you.
Man
of
prejudice,
good
bye.
William,
good
bye.
Children,
come
up
to
Fieldhead
to
morrow,
and
you
shall
choose
what
you
like
best
out
of
Mrs.
Gill's
store
room."
The
hour
was
now
that
of
dusk.
A
clear
air
favoured
the
kindling
of
the
stars.
"There
will
be
just
light
enough
to
show
me
the
way
home,"
said
Miss
Keeldar,
as
she
prepared
to
take
leave
of
Caroline
at
the
rectory
garden
door.
"You
must
not
go
alone,
Shirley;
Fanny
shall
accompany
you."
"That
she
shall
not.
Of
what
need
I
be
afraid
in
my
own
parish?
I
would
walk
from
Fieldhead
to
the
church
any
fine
midsummer
night,
three
hours
later
than
this,
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
seeing
the
stars
and
the
chance
of
meeting
a
fairy."
"But
just
wait
till
the
crowd
is
cleared
away."
"Agreed.
There
are
the
five
Misses
Armitage
streaming
by.
Here
comes
Mrs.
Sykes's
phaeton,
Mr.
Wynne's
close
carriage,
Mrs.
Birtwhistle's
car.
I
don't
wish
to
go
through
the
ceremony
of
bidding
them
all
good
bye,
so
we
will
step
into
the
garden
and
take
shelter
amongst
the
laburnums
for
an
instant."
The
rectors,
their
curates,
and
their
churchwardens
now
issued
from
the
church
porch.
There
was
a
great
confabulation,
shaking
of
hands,
congratulation
on
speeches,
recommendation
to
be
careful
of
the
night
air,
etc.
By
degrees
the
throng
dispersed,
the
carriages
drove
off.
Miss
Keeldar
was
just
emerging
from
her
flowery
refuge
when
Mr.
Helstone
entered
the
garden
and
met
her.
"Oh,
I
want
you!"
he
said.
"I
was
afraid
you
were
already
gone.
Caroline,
come
here."
Caroline
came,
expecting,
as
Shirley
did,
a
lecture
on
not
having
been
visible
at
church.
Other
subjects,
however,
occupied
the
rector's
mind.
"I
shall
not
sleep
at
home
to
night,"
he
continued.
"I
have
just
met
with
an
old
friend,
and
promised
to
accompany
him.
I
shall
return
probably
about
noon
to
morrow.
Thomas,
the
clerk,
is
engaged,
and
I
cannot
get
him
to
sleep
in
the
house,
as
I
usually
do
when
I
am
absent
for
a
night.
Now
"
"Now,"
interrupted
Shirley,
"you
want
me
as
a
gentleman
the
first
gentleman
in
Briarfield,
in
short
to
supply
your
place,
be
master
of
the
rectory
and
guardian
of
your
niece
and
maids
while
you
are
away?"
"Exactly,
captain.
I
thought
the
post
would
suit
you.
Will
you
favour
Caroline
so
far
as
to
be
her
guest
for
one
night?
Will
you
stay
here
instead
of
going
back
to
Fieldhead?"
"And
what
will
Mrs.
Pryor
do?
she
expects
me
home."
"I
will
send
her
word.
Come,
make
up
your
mind
to
stay.
It
grows
late;
the
dew
falls
heavily.
You
and
Caroline
will
enjoy
each
other's
society,
I
doubt
not."
"I
promise
you,
then,
to
stay
with
Caroline,"
replied
Shirley.
"As
you
say,
we
shall
enjoy
each
other's
society.
We
will
not
be
separated
to
night.
Now,
rejoin
your
old
friend,
and
fear
nothing
for
us."
"If
there
should
chance
to
be
any
disturbance
in
the
night,
captain;
if
you
should
hear
the
picking
of
a
lock,
the
cutting
out
of
a
pane
of
glass,
a
stealthy
tread
of
steps
about
the
house
(and
I
need
not
fear
to
tell
you,
who
bear
a
well
tempered,
mettlesome
heart
under
your
girl's
ribbon
sash,
that
such
little
incidents
are
very
possible
in
the
present
time),
what
would
you
do?"
"Don't
know;
faint,
perhaps
fall
down,
and
have
to
be
picked
up
again.
But,
doctor,
if
you
assign
me
the
post
of
honour,
you
must
give
me
arms.
What
weapons
are
there
in
your
stronghold?"
"You
could
not
wield
a
sword?"
"No;
I
could
manage
the
carving
knife
better."
"You
will
find
a
good
one
in
the
dining
room
sideboard
a
lady's
knife,
light
to
handle,
and
as
sharp
pointed
as
a
poniard."
"It
will
suit
Caroline.
But
you
must
give
me
a
brace
of
pistols.
I
know
you
have
pistols."
"I
have
two
pairs.
One
pair
I
can
place
at
your
disposal.
You
will
find
them
suspended
over
the
mantelpiece
of
my
study
in
cloth
cases."
"Loaded?"
"Yes,
but
not
on
the
cock.
Cock
them
before
you
go
to
bed.
It
is
paying
you
a
great
compliment,
captain,
to
lend
you
these.
Were
you
one
of
the
awkward
squad
you
should
not
have
them."
"I
will
take
care.
You
need
delay
no
longer,
Mr.
Helstone.
You
may
go
now.
He
is
gracious
to
me
to
lend
me
his
pistols,"
she
remarked,
as
the
rector
passed
out
at
the
garden
gate.
"But
come,
Lina,"
she
continued,
"let
us
go
in
and
have
some
supper.
I
was
too
much
vexed
at
tea
with
the
vicinage
of
Mr.
Sam
Wynne
to
be
able
to
eat,
and
now
I
am
really
hungry."
Entering
the
house,
they
repaired
to
the
darkened
dining
room,
through
the
open
windows
of
which
apartment
stole
the
evening
air,
bearing
the
perfume
of
flowers
from
the
garden,
the
very
distant
sound
of
far
retreating
steps
from
the
road,
and
a
soft,
vague
murmur
whose
origin
Caroline
explained
by
the
remark,
uttered
as
she
stood
listening
at
the
casement,
"Shirley,
I
hear
the
beck
in
the
Hollow."
Then
she
rang
the
bell,
asked
for
a
candle
and
some
bread
and
milk
Miss
Keeldar's
usual
supper
and
her
own.
Fanny,
when
she
brought
in
the
tray,
would
have
closed
the
windows
and
the
shutters,
but
was
requested
to
desist
for
the
present.
The
twilight
was
too
calm,
its
breath
too
balmy
to
be
yet
excluded.
They
took
their
meal
in
silence.
Caroline
rose
once
to
remove
to
the
window
sill
a
glass
of
flowers
which
stood
on
the
sideboard,
the
exhalation
from
the
blossoms
being
somewhat
too
powerful
for
the
sultry
room.
In
returning
she
half
opened
a
drawer,
and
took
from
it
something
that
glittered
clear
and
keen
in
her
hand.
"You
assigned
this
to
me,
then,
Shirley,
did
you?
It
is
bright,
keen
edged,
finely
tapered;
it
is
dangerous
looking.
I
never
yet
felt
the
impulse
which
could
move
me
to
direct
this
against
a
fellow
creature.
It
is
difficult
to
fancy
that
circumstances
could
nerve
my
arm
to
strike
home
with
this
long
knife."
"I
should
hate
to
do
it,"
replied
Shirley,
"but
I
think
I
could
do
it,
if
goaded
by
certain
exigencies
which
I
can
imagine."
And
Miss
Keeldar
quietly
sipped
her
glass
of
new
milk,
looking
somewhat
thoughtful
and
a
little
pale;
though,
indeed,
when
did
she
not
look
pale?
She
was
never
florid.
The
milk
sipped
and
the
bread
eaten,
Fanny
was
again
summoned.
She
and
Eliza
were
recommended
to
go
to
bed,
which
they
were
quite
willing
to
do,
being
weary
of
the
day's
exertions,
of
much
cutting
of
currant
buns,
and
filling
of
urns
and
teapots,
and
running
backwards
and
forwards
with
trays.
Ere
long
the
maids'
chamber
door
was
heard
to
close.
Caroline
took
a
candle
and
went
quietly
all
over
the
house,
seeing
that
every
window
was
fast
and
every
door
barred.
She
did
not
even
evade
the
haunted
back
kitchen
nor
the
vault
like
cellars.
These
visited,
she
returned.
"There
is
neither
spirit
nor
flesh
in
the
house
at
present,"
she
said,
"which
should
not
be
there.
It
is
now
near
eleven
o'clock,
fully
bedtime;
yet
I
would
rather
sit
up
a
little
longer,
if
you
do
not
object,
Shirley.
Here,"
she
continued,
"I
have
brought
the
brace
of
pistols
from
my
uncle's
study.
You
may
examine
them
at
your
leisure."
She
placed
them
on
the
table
before
her
friend.
"Why
would
you
rather
sit
up
longer?"
asked
Miss
Keeldar,
taking
up
the
firearms,
examining
them,
and
again
laying
them
down.
"Because
I
have
a
strange,
excited
feeling
in
my
heart."
"So
have
I."
"Is
this
state
of
sleeplessness
and
restlessness
caused
by
something
electrical
in
the
air,
I
wonder?"
"No;
the
sky
is
clear,
the
stars
numberless.
It
is
a
fine
night."
"But
very
still.
I
hear
the
water
fret
over
its
stony
bed
in
Hollow's
Copse
as
distinctly
as
if
it
ran
below
the
churchyard
wall."
"I
am
glad
it
is
so
still
a
night.
A
moaning
wind
or
rushing
rain
would
vex
me
to
fever
just
now."
"Why,
Shirley?"
"Because
it
would
baffle
my
efforts
to
listen."
"Do
you
listen
towards
the
Hollow?"
"Yes;
it
is
the
only
quarter
whence
we
can
hear
a
sound
just
now."
"The
only
one,
Shirley."
They
both
sat
near
the
window,
and
both
leaned
their
arms
on
the
sill,
and
both
inclined
their
heads
towards
the
open
lattice.
They
saw
each
other's
young
faces
by
the
starlight
and
that
dim
June
twilight
which
does
not
wholly
fade
from
the
west
till
dawn
begins
to
break
in
the
east.
"Mr.
Helstone
thinks
we
have
no
idea
which
way
he
is
gone,"
murmured
Miss
Keeldar,
"nor
on
what
errand,
nor
with
what
expectations,
nor
how
prepared.
But
I
guess
much;
do
not
you?"
"I
guess
something."
"All
those
gentlemen
your
cousin
Moore
included
think
that
you
and
I
are
now
asleep
in
our
beds,
unconscious."
"Caring
nothing
about
them
hoping
and
fearing
nothing
for
them,"
added
Caroline.
Both
kept
silent
for
full
half
an
hour.
The
night
was
silent
too;
only
the
church
clock
measured
its
course
by
quarters.
Some
words
were
interchanged
about
the
chill
of
the
air.
They
wrapped
their
scarves
closer
round
them,
resumed
their
bonnets,
which
they
had
removed,
and
again
watched.
Towards
midnight
the
teasing,
monotonous
bark
of
the
house
dog
disturbed
the
quietude
of
their
vigil.
Caroline
rose,
and
made
her
way
noiselessly
through
the
dark
passages
to
the
kitchen,
intending
to
appease
him
with
a
piece
of
bread.
She
succeeded.
On
returning
to
the
dining
room
she
found
it
all
dark,
Miss
Keeldar
having
extinguished
the
candle.
The
outline
of
her
shape
was
visible
near
the
still
open
window,
leaning
out.
Miss
Helstone
asked
no
questions;
she
stole
to
her
side.
The
dog
recommenced
barking
furiously.
Suddenly
he
stopped,
and
seemed
to
listen.
The
occupants
of
the
dining
room
listened
too,
and
not
merely
now
to
the
flow
of
the
mill
stream.
There
was
a
nearer,
though
a
muffled,
sound
on
the
road
below
the
churchyard
a
measured,
beating,
approaching
sound
a
dull
tramp
of
marching
feet.
It
drew
near.
Those
who
listened
by
degrees
comprehended
its
extent.
It
was
not
the
tread
of
two,
nor
of
a
dozen,
nor
of
a
score
of
men;
it
was
the
tread
of
hundreds.
They
could
see
nothing;
the
high
shrubs
of
the
garden
formed
a
leafy
screen
between
them
and
the
road.
To
hear,
however,
was
not
enough,
and
this
they
felt
as
the
troop
trod
forwards,
and
seemed
actually
passing
the
rectory.
They
felt
it
more
when
a
human
voice
though
that
voice
spoke
but
one
word
broke
the
hush
of
the
night.
"Halt!"
A
halt
followed.
The
march
was
arrested.
Then
came
a
low
conference,
of
which
no
word
was
distinguishable
from
the
dining
room.
"We
must
hear
this,"
said
Shirley.
She
turned,
took
her
pistols
from
the
table,
silently
passed
out
through
the
middle
window
of
the
dining
room,
which
was,
in
fact,
a
glass
door,
stole
down
the
walk
to
the
garden
wall,
and
stood
listening
under
the
lilacs.
Caroline
would
not
have
quitted
the
house
had
she
been
alone,
but
where
Shirley
went
she
would
go.
She
glanced
at
the
weapon
on
the
sideboard,
but
left
it
behind
her,
and
presently
stood
at
her
friend's
side.
They
dared
not
look
over
the
wall,
for
fear
of
being
seen;
they
were
obliged
to
crouch
behind
it.
They
heard
these
words,
"It
looks
a
rambling
old
building.
Who
lives
in
it
besides
the
damned
parson?"
"Only
three
women
his
niece
and
two
servants."
"Do
you
know
where
they
sleep?"
"The
lasses
behind;
the
niece
in
a
front
room."
"And
Helstone?"
"Yonder
is
his
chamber.
He
was
burning
a
light,
but
I
see
none
now."
"Where
would
you
get
in?"
"If
I
were
ordered
to
do
his
job
and
he
desarves
it
I'd
try
yond'
long
window;
it
opens
to
the
dining
room.
I
could
grope
my
way
upstairs,
and
I
know
his
chamber."
"How
would
you
manage
about
the
women
folk?"
"Let
'em
alone
except
they
shrieked,
and
then
I'd
soon
quieten
'em.
I
could
wish
to
find
the
old
chap
asleep.
If
he
waked,
he'd
be
dangerous."
"Has
he
arms?"
"Firearms,
allus
and
allus
loadened."
"Then
you're
a
fool
to
stop
us
here.
A
shot
would
give
the
alarm.
Moore
would
be
on
us
before
we
could
turn
round.
We
should
miss
our
main
object."
"You
might
go
on,
I
tell
you.
I'd
engage
Helstone
alone."
A
pause.
One
of
the
party
dropped
some
weapon,
which
rang
on
the
stone
causeway.
At
this
sound
the
rectory
dog
barked
again
furiously
fiercely.
"That
spoils
all!"
said
the
voice.
"He'll
awake.
A
noise
like
that
might
rouse
the
dead.
You
did
not
say
there
was
a
dog.
Damn
you!
Forward!"
Forward
they
went
tramp,
tramp
with
mustering,
manifold,
slow
filing
tread.
They
were
gone.
Shirley
stood
erect,
looked
over
the
wall,
along
the
road.
"Not
a
soul
remains,"
she
said.
She
stood
and
mused.
"Thank
God!"
was
the
next
observation.
Caroline
repeated
the
ejaculation
not
in
so
steady
a
tone.
She
was
trembling
much.
Her
heart
was
beating
fast
and
thick;
her
face
was
cold,
her
forehead
damp.
"Thank
God
for
us!"
she
reiterated.
"But
what
will
happen
elsewhere?
They
have
passed
us
by
that
they
may
make
sure
of
others."
"They
have
done
well,"
returned
Shirley,
with
composure.
"The
others
will
defend
themselves.
They
can
do
it.
They
are
prepared
for
them.
With
us
it
is
otherwise.
My
finger
was
on
the
trigger
of
this
pistol.
I
was
quite
ready
to
give
that
man,
if
he
had
entered,
such
a
greeting
as
he
little
calculated
on;
but
behind
him
followed
three
hundred.
I
had
neither
three
hundred
hands
nor
three
hundred
weapons.
I
could
not
have
effectually
protected
either
you,
myself,
or
the
two
poor
women
asleep
under
that
roof.
Therefore
I
again
earnestly
thank
God
for
insult
and
peril
escaped."
After
a
second
pause
she
continued:
"What
is
it
my
duty
and
wisdom
to
do
next?
Not
to
stay
here
inactive,
I
am
glad
to
say,
but,
of
course,
to
walk
over
to
the
Hollow."
"To
the
Hollow,
Shirley?"
"To
the
Hollow.
Will
you
go
with
me?"
"Where
those
men
are
gone?"
"They
have
taken
the
highway;
we
should
not
encounter
them.
The
road
over
the
fields
is
as
safe,
silent,
and
solitary
as
a
path
through
the
air
would
be.
Will
you
go?"
"Yes,"
was
the
answer,
given
mechanically,
not
because
the
speaker
wished
or
was
prepared
to
go,
or,
indeed,
was
otherwise
than
scared
at
the
prospect
of
going,
but
because
she
felt
she
could
not
abandon
Shirley.
"Then
we
must
fasten
up
these
windows,
and
leave
all
as
secure
as
we
can
behind
us.
Do
you
know
what
we
are
going
for,
Cary?"
"Yes
no
because
you
wish
it."
"Is
that
all?
And
are
you
so
obedient
to
a
mere
caprice
of
mine?
What
a
docile
wife
you
would
make
to
a
stern
husband!
The
moon's
face
is
not
whiter
than
yours
at
this
moment,
and
the
aspen
at
the
gate
does
not
tremble
more
than
your
busy
fingers;
and
so,
tractable
and
terror
struck,
and
dismayed
and
devoted,
you
would
follow
me
into
the
thick
of
real
danger!
Cary,
let
me
give
your
fidelity
a
motive.
We
are
going
for
Moore's
sake
to
see
if
we
can
be
of
use
to
him,
to
make
an
effort
to
warn
him
of
what
is
coming."
"To
be
sure!
I
am
a
blind,
weak
fool,
and
you
are
acute
and
sensible,
Shirley.
I
will
go
with
you;
I
will
gladly
go
with
you!"
"I
do
not
doubt
it.
You
would
die
blindly
and
meekly
for
me,
but
you
would
intelligently
and
gladly
die
for
Moore.
But,
in
truth,
there
is
no
question
of
death
to
night;
we
run
no
risk
at
all."
Caroline
rapidly
closed
shutter
and
lattice.
"Do
not
fear
that
I
shall
not
have
breath
to
run
as
fast
as
you
can
possibly
run,
Shirley.
Take
my
hand.
Let
us
go
straight
across
the
fields."
"But
you
cannot
climb
walls?"
"To
night
I
can."
"You
are
afraid
of
hedges,
and
the
beck
which
we
shall
be
forced
to
cross?"
"I
can
cross
it."
They
started;
they
ran.
Many
a
wall
checked
but
did
not
baffle
them.
Shirley
was
surefooted
and
agile;
she
could
spring
like
a
deer
when
she
chose.
Caroline,
more
timid
and
less
dexterous,
fell
once
or
twice,
and
bruised
herself;
but
she
rose
again
directly,
saying
she
was
not
hurt.
A
quickset
hedge
bounded
the
last
field;
they
lost
time
in
seeking
a
gap
in
it.
The
aperture,
when
found,
was
narrow,
but
they
worked
their
way
through.
The
long
hair,
the
tender
skin,
the
silks
and
the
muslins
suffered;
but
what
was
chiefly
regretted
was
the
impediment
this
difficulty
had
caused
to
speed.
On
the
other
side
they
met
the
beck,
flowing
deep
in
a
rough
bed.
At
this
point
a
narrow
plank
formed
the
only
bridge
across
it.
Shirley
had
trodden
the
plank
successfully
and
fearlessly
many
a
time
before;
Caroline
had
never
yet
dared
to
risk
the
transit.
"I
will
carry
you
across,"
said
Miss
Keeldar.
"You
are
light,
and
I
am
not
weak.
Let
me
try."
"If
I
fall
in,
you
may
fish
me
out,"
was
the
answer,
as
a
grateful
squeeze
compressed
her
hand.
Caroline,
without
pausing,
trod
forward
on
the
trembling
plank
as
if
it
were
a
continuation
of
the
firm
turf.
Shirley,
who
followed,
did
not
cross
it
more
resolutely
or
safely.
In
their
present
humour,
on
their
present
errand,
a
strong
and
foaming
channel
would
have
been
a
barrier
to
neither.
At
the
moment
they
were
above
the
control
either
of
fire
or
water.
All
Stilbro'
Moor,
alight
and
aglow
with
bonfires,
would
not
have
stopped
them,
nor
would
Calder
or
Aire
thundering
in
flood.
Yet
one
sound
made
them
pause.
Scarce
had
they
set
foot
on
the
solid
opposite
bank
when
a
shot
split
the
air
from
the
north.
One
second
elapsed.
Further
off
burst
a
like
note
in
the
south.
Within
the
space
of
three
minutes
similar
signals
boomed
in
the
east
and
west.
"I
thought
we
were
dead
at
the
first
explosion,"
observed
Shirley,
drawing
a
long
breath.
"I
felt
myself
hit
in
the
temples,
and
I
concluded
your
heart
was
pierced;
but
the
reiterated
voice
was
an
explanation.
Those
are
signals
it
is
their
way
the
attack
must
be
near.
We
should
have
had
wings.
Our
feet
have
not
borne
us
swiftly
enough."
A
portion
of
the
copse
was
now
to
clear.
When
they
emerged
from
it
the
mill
lay
just
below
them.
They
could
look
down
upon
the
buildings,
the
yard;
they
could
see
the
road
beyond.
And
the
first
glance
in
that
direction
told
Shirley
she
was
right
in
her
conjecture.
They
were
already
too
late
to
give
warning.
It
had
taken
more
time
than
they
calculated
on
to
overcome
the
various
obstacles
which
embarrassed
the
short
cut
across
the
fields.
The
road,
which
should
have
been
white,
was
dark
with
a
moving
mass.
The
rioters
were
assembled
in
front
of
the
closed
yard
gates,
and
a
single
figure
stood
within,
apparently
addressing
them.
The
mill
itself
was
perfectly
black
and
still.
There
was
neither
life,
light,
nor
motion
around
it.
"Surely
he
is
prepared.
Surely
that
is
not
Moore
meeting
them
alone?"
whispered
Shirley.
"It
is.
We
must
go
to
him.
I
will
go
to
him."
"That
you
will
not."
"Why
did
I
come,
then?
I
came
only
for
him.
I
shall
join
him."
"Fortunately
it
is
out
of
your
power.
There
is
no
entrance
to
the
yard."
"There
is
a
small
entrance
at
the
back,
besides
the
gates
in
front.
It
opens
by
a
secret
method
which
I
know.
I
will
try
it."
"Not
with
my
leave."
Miss
Keeldar
clasped
her
round
the
waist
with
both
arms
and
held
her
back.
"Not
one
step
shall
you
stir,"
she
went
on
authoritatively.
"At
this
moment
Moore
would
be
both
shocked
and
embarrassed
if
he
saw
either
you
or
me.
Men
never
want
women
near
them
in
time
of
real
danger."
"I
would
not
trouble
I
would
help
him,"
was
the
reply.
"How?
by
inspiring
him
with
heroism?
Pooh!
these
are
not
the
days
of
chivalry.
It
is
not
a
tilt
at
a
tournament
we
are
going
to
behold,
but
a
struggle
about
money,
and
food,
and
life."
"It
is
natural
that
I
should
be
at
his
side."
"As
queen
of
his
heart?
His
mill
is
his
lady
love,
Cary!
Backed
by
his
factory
and
his
frames,
he
has
all
the
encouragement
he
wants
or
can
know.
It
is
not
for
love
or
beauty,
but
for
ledger
and
broadcloth,
he
is
going
to
break
a
spear.
Don't
be
sentimental;
Robert
is
not
so."
"I
could
help
him;
I
will
seek
him."
"Off
then
I
let
you
go
seek
Moore.
You'll
not
find
him."
She
loosened
her
hold.
Caroline
sped
like
levelled
shaft
from
bent
bow;
after
her
rang
a
jesting,
gibing
laugh.
"Look
well
there
is
no
mistake!"
was
the
warning
given.
But
there
was
a
mistake.
Miss
Helstone
paused,
hesitated,
gazed.
The
figure
had
suddenly
retreated
from
the
gate,
and
was
running
back
hastily
to
the
mill.
"Make
haste,
Lina!"
cried
Shirley;
"meet
him
before
he
enters."
Caroline
slowly
returned.
"It
is
not
Robert,"
she
said.
"It
has
neither
his
height,
form,
nor
bearing."
"I
saw
it
was
not
Robert
when
I
let
you
go.
How
could
you
imagine
it?
It
is
a
shabby
little
figure
of
a
private
soldier;
they
had
posted
him
as
sentinel.
He
is
safe
in
the
mill
now.
I
saw
the
door
open
and
admit
him.
My
mind
grows
easier.
Robert
is
prepared.
Our
warning
would
have
been
superfluous;
and
now
I
am
thankful
we
came
too
late
to
give
it.
It
has
saved
us
the
trouble
of
a
scene.
How
fine
to
have
entered
the
counting
house
toute
eperdue,
and
to
have
found
oneself
in
presence
of
Messrs.
Armitage
and
Ramsden
smoking,
Malone
swaggering,
your
uncle
sneering,
Mr.
Sykes
sipping
a
cordial,
and
Moore
himself
in
his
cold
man
of
business
vein!
I
am
glad
we
missed
it
all."
"I
wonder
if
there
are
many
in
the
mill,
Shirley!"
"Plenty
to
defend
it.
The
soldiers
we
have
twice
seen
to
day
were
going
there,
no
doubt,
and
the
group
we
noticed
surrounding
your
cousin
in
the
fields
will
be
with
him."
"What
are
they
doing
now,
Shirley?
What
is
that
noise?"
"Hatchets
and
crowbars
against
the
yard
gates.
They
are
forcing
them.
Are
you
afraid?"
"No;
but
my
heart
throbs
fast.
I
have
a
difficulty
in
standing.
I
will
sit
down.
Do
you
feel
unmoved?"
"Hardly
that;
but
I
am
glad
I
came.
We
shall
see
what
transpires
with
our
own
eyes.
We
are
here
on
the
spot,
and
none
know
it.
Instead
of
amazing
the
curate,
the
clothier,
and
the
corn
dealer
with
a
romantic
rush
on
the
stage,
we
stand
alone
with
the
friendly
night,
its
mute
stars,
and
these
whispering
trees,
whose
report
our
friends
will
not
come
to
gather."
"Shirley,
Shirley,
the
gates
are
down!
That
crash
was
like
the
felling
of
great
trees.
Now
they
are
pouring
through.
They
will
break
down
the
mill
doors
as
they
have
broken
the
gate.
What
can
Robert
do
against
so
many?
Would
to
God
I
were
a
little
nearer
him
could
hear
him
speak
could
speak
to
him!
With
my
will
my
longing
to
serve
him
I
could
not
be
a
useless
burden
in
his
way;
I
could
be
turned
to
some
account."
"They
come
on!"
cried
Shirley.
"How
steadily
they
march
in!
There
is
discipline
in
their
ranks.
I
will
not
say
there
is
courage
hundreds
against
tens
are
no
proof
of
that
quality
but"
(she
dropped
her
voice)
"there
is
suffering
and
desperation
enough
amongst
them.
These
goads
will
urge
them
forwards."
"Forwards
against
Robert;
and
they
hate
him.
Shirley,
is
there
much
danger
they
will
win
the
day?"
"We
shall
see.
Moore
and
Helstone
are
of
'earth's
first
blood'
no
bunglers
no
cravens
"
A
crash
smash
shiver
stopped
their
whispers.
A
simultaneously
hurled
volley
of
stones
had
saluted
the
broad
front
of
the
mill,
with
all
its
windows;
and
now
every
pane
of
every
lattice
lay
in
shattered
and
pounded
fragments.
A
yell
followed
this
demonstration
a
rioters'
yell
a
north
of
England,
a
Yorkshire,
a
West
Riding,
a
West
Riding
clothing
district
of
Yorkshire
rioters'
yell.
You
never
heard
that
sound,
perhaps,
reader?
So
much
the
better
for
your
ears
perhaps
for
your
heart,
since,
if
it
rends
the
air
in
hate
to
yourself,
or
to
the
men
or
principles
you
approve,
the
interests
to
which
you
wish
well,
wrath
wakens
to
the
cry
of
hate;
the
lion
shakes
his
mane,
and
rises
to
the
howl
of
the
hyena;
caste
stands
up,
ireful
against
caste;
and
the
indignant,
wronged
spirit
of
the
middle
rank
bears
down
in
zeal
and
scorn
on
the
famished
and
furious
mass
of
the
operative
class.
It
is
difficult
to
be
tolerant,
difficult
to
be
just,
in
such
moments.
Caroline
rose;
Shirley
put
her
arm
round
her:
they
stood
together
as
still
as
the
straight
stems
of
two
trees.
That
yell
was
a
long
one,
and
when
it
ceased
the
night
was
yet
full
of
the
swaying
and
murmuring
of
a
crowd.
"What
next?"
was
the
question
of
the
listeners.
Nothing
came
yet.
The
mill
remained
mute
as
a
mausoleum.
"He
cannot
be
alone!"
whispered
Caroline.
"I
would
stake
all
I
have
that
he
is
as
little
alone
as
he
is
alarmed,"
responded
Shirley.
Shots
were
discharged
by
the
rioters.
Had
the
defenders
waited
for
this
signal?
It
seemed
so.
The
hitherto
inert
and
passive
mill
woke;
fire
flashed
from
its
empty
window
frames;
a
volley
of
musketry
pealed
sharp
through
the
Hollow.
"Moore
speaks
at
last!"
said
Shirley,
"and
he
seems
to
have
the
gift
of
tongues.
That
was
not
a
single
voice."
"He
has
been
forbearing.
No
one
can
accuse
him
of
rashness,"
alleged
Caroline.
"Their
discharge
preceded
his.
They
broke
his
gates
and
his
windows.
They
fired
at
his
garrison
before
he
repelled
them."
What
was
going
on
now?
It
seemed
difficult,
in
the
darkness,
to
distinguish;
but
something
terrible,
a
still
renewing
tumult,
was
obvious
fierce
attacks,
desperate
repulses.
The
mill
yard,
the
mill
itself,
was
full
of
battle
movement.
There
was
scarcely
any
cessation
now
of
the
discharge
of
firearms;
and
there
was
struggling,
rushing,
trampling,
and
shouting
between.
The
aim
of
the
assailants
seemed
to
be
to
enter
the
mill,
that
of
the
defenders
to
beat
them
off.
They
heard
the
rebel
leader
cry,
"To
the
back,
lads!"
They
heard
a
voice
retort,
"Come
round;
we
will
meet
you."
"To
the
counting
house!"
was
the
order
again.
"Welcome!
we
shall
have
you
there!"
was
the
response.
And
accordingly
the
fiercest
blaze
that
had
yet
glowed,
the
loudest
rattle
that
had
yet
been
heard,
burst
from
the
counting
house
front
when
the
mass
of
rioters
rushed
up
to
it.
The
voice
that
had
spoken
was
Moore's
own
voice.
They
could
tell
by
its
tones
that
his
soul
was
now
warm
with
the
conflict;
they
could
guess
that
the
fighting
animal
was
roused
in
every
one
of
those
men
there
struggling
together,
and
was
for
the
time
quite
paramount
above
the
rational
human
being.
Both
the
girls
felt
their
faces
glow
and
their
pulses
throb;
both
knew
they
would
do
no
good
by
rushing
down
into
the
melee.
They
desired
neither
to
deal
nor
to
receive
blows;
but
they
could
not
have
run
away
Caroline
no
more
than
Shirley;
they
could
not
have
fainted;
they
could
not
have
taken
their
eyes
from
the
dim,
terrible
scene
from
the
mass
of
cloud,
of
smoke,
the
musket
lightning
for
the
world.
"How
and
when
would
it
end?"
was
the
demand
throbbing
in
their
throbbing
pulses.
"Would
a
juncture
arise
in
which
they
could
be
useful?"
was
what
they
waited
to
see;
for
though
Shirley
put
off
their
too
late
arrival
with
a
jest,
and
was
ever
ready
to
satirize
her
own
or
any
other
person's
enthusiasm,
she
would
have
given
a
farm
of
her
best
land
for
a
chance
of
rendering
good
service.
The
chance
was
not
vouchsafed
her;
the
looked
for
juncture
never
came.
It
was
not
likely.
Moore
had
expected
this
attack
for
days,
perhaps
weeks;
he
was
prepared
for
it
at
every
point.
He
had
fortified
and
garrisoned
his
mill,
which
in
itself
was
a
strong
building.
He
was
a
cool,
brave
man;
he
stood
to
the
defence
with
unflinching
firmness.
Those
who
were
with
him
caught
his
spirit,
and
copied
his
demeanour.
The
rioters
had
never
been
so
met
before.
At
other
mills
they
had
attacked
they
had
found
no
resistance;
an
organized,
resolute
defence
was
what
they
never
dreamed
of
encountering.
When
their
leaders
saw
the
steady
fire
kept
up
from
the
mill,
witnessed
the
composure
and
determination
of
its
owner,
heard
themselves
coolly
defied
and
invited
on
to
death,
and
beheld
their
men
falling
wounded
round
them,
they
felt
that
nothing
was
to
be
done
here.
In
haste
they
mustered
their
forces,
drew
them
away
from
the
building.
A
roll
was
called
over,
in
which
the
men
answered
to
figures
instead
of
names.
They
dispersed
wide
over
the
fields,
leaving
silence
and
ruin
behind
them.
The
attack,
from
its
commencement
to
its
termination,
had
not
occupied
an
hour.
Day
was
by
this
time
approaching;
the
west
was
dim,
the
east
beginning
to
gleam.
It
would
have
seemed
that
the
girls
who
had
watched
this
conflict
would
now
wish
to
hasten
to
the
victors,
on
whose
side
all
their
interest
had
been
enlisted;
but
they
only
very
cautiously
approached
the
now
battered
mill,
and
when
suddenly
a
number
of
soldiers
and
gentlemen
appeared
at
the
great
door
opening
into
the
yard,
they
quickly
stepped
aside
into
a
shed,
the
deposit
of
old
iron
and
timber,
whence
they
could
see
without
being
seen.
It
was
no
cheering
spectacle.
These
premises
were
now
a
mere
blot
of
desolation
on
the
fresh
front
of
the
summer
dawn.
All
the
copse
up
the
Hollow
was
shady
and
dewy,
the
hill
at
its
head
was
green;
but
just
here,
in
the
centre
of
the
sweet
glen,
Discord,
broken
loose
in
the
night
from
control,
had
beaten
the
ground
with
his
stamping
hoofs,
and
left
it
waste
and
pulverized.
The
mill
yawned
all
ruinous
with
unglazed
frames;
the
yard
was
thickly
bestrewn
with
stones
and
brickbats;
and
close
under
the
mill,
with
the
glittering
fragments
of
the
shattered
windows,
muskets
and
other
weapons
lay
here
and
there.
More
than
one
deep
crimson
stain
was
visible
on
the
gravel,
a
human
body
lay
quiet
on
its
face
near
the
gates,
and
five
or
six
wounded
men
writhed
and
moaned
in
the
bloody
dust.
Miss
Keeldar's
countenance
changed
at
this
view.
It
was
the
after
taste
of
the
battle,
death
and
pain
replacing
excitement
and
exertion.
It
was
the
blackness
the
bright
fire
leaves
when
its
blaze
is
sunk,
its
warmth
failed,
and
its
glow
faded.
"This
is
what
I
wished
to
prevent,"
she
said,
in
a
voice
whose
cadence
betrayed
the
altered
impulse
of
her
heart.
"But
you
could
not
prevent
it;
you
did
your
best
it
was
in
vain,"
said
Caroline
comfortingly.
"Don't
grieve,
Shirley."
"I
am
sorry
for
those
poor
fellows,"
was
the
answer,
while
the
spark
in
her
glance
dissolved
to
dew.
"Are
any
within
the
mill
hurt,
I
wonder?
Is
that
your
uncle?"
"It
is,
and
there
is
Mr.
Malone;
and,
O
Shirley,
there
is
Robert!"
"Well"
(resuming
her
former
tone),
"don't
squeeze
your
fingers
quite
into
my
hand.
I
see.
There
is
nothing
wonderful
in
that.
We
knew
he,
at
least,
was
here,
whoever
might
be
absent."
"He
is
coming
here
towards
us,
Shirley!"
"Towards
the
pump,
that
is
to
say,
for
the
purpose
of
washing
his
hands
and
his
forehead,
which
has
got
a
scratch,
I
perceive."
"He
bleeds,
Shirley.
Don't
hold
me.
I
must
go."
"Not
a
step."
"He
is
hurt,
Shirley!"
"Fiddlestick!"
"But
I
must
go
to
him.
I
wish
to
go
so
much.
I
cannot
bear
to
be
restrained."
"What
for?"
"To
speak
to
him,
to
ask
how
he
is,
and
what
I
can
do
for
him."
"To
tease
and
annoy
him;
to
make
a
spectacle
of
yourself
and
him
before
those
soldiers,
Mr.
Malone,
your
uncle,
et
cetera.
Would
he
like
it,
think
you?
Would
you
like
to
remember
it
a
week
hence?"
"Am
I
always
to
be
curbed
and
kept
down?"
demanded
Caroline,
a
little
passionately.
"For
his
sake,
yes;
and
still
more
for
your
own.
I
tell
you,
if
you
showed
yourself
now
you
would
repent
it
an
hour
hence,
and
so
would
Robert."
"You
think
he
would
not
like
it,
Shirley?"
"Far
less
than
he
would
like
our
stopping
him
to
say
good
night,
which
you
were
so
sore
about."
"But
that
was
all
play;
there
was
no
danger."
"And
this
is
serious
work;
he
must
be
unmolested."
"I
only
wish
to
go
to
him
because
he
is
my
cousin
you
understand?"
"I
quite
understand.
But
now,
watch
him.
He
has
bathed
his
forehead,
and
the
blood
has
ceased
trickling.
His
hurt
is
really
a
mere
graze;
I
can
see
it
from
hence.
He
is
going
to
look
after
the
wounded
men."
Accordingly
Mr.
Moore
and
Mr.
Helstone
went
round
the
yard,
examining
each
prostrate
form.
They
then
gave
directions
to
have
the
wounded
taken
up
and
carried
into
the
mill.
This
duty
being
performed,
Joe
Scott
was
ordered
to
saddle
his
master's
horse
and
Mr.
Helstone's
pony,
and
the
two
gentlemen
rode
away
full
gallop,
to
seek
surgical
aid
in
different
directions.
Caroline
was
not
yet
pacified.
"Shirley,
Shirley,
I
should
have
liked
to
speak
one
word
to
him
before
he
went,"
she
murmured,
while
the
tears
gathered
glittering
in
her
eyes.
"Why
do
you
cry,
Lina?"
asked
Miss
Keeldar
a
little
sternly.
"You
ought
to
be
glad
instead
of
sorry.
Robert
has
escaped
any
serious
harm;
he
is
victorious;
he
has
been
cool
and
brave
in
combat;
he
is
now
considerate
in
triumph.
Is
this
a
time
are
these
causes
for
weeping?"
"You
do
not
know
what
I
have
in
my
heart,"
pleaded
the
other
"what
pain,
what
distraction
nor
whence
it
arises.
I
can
understand
that
you
should
exult
in
Robert's
greatness
and
goodness;
so
do
I,
in
one
sense,
but
in
another
I
feel
so
miserable.
I
am
too
far
removed
from
him.
I
used
to
be
nearer.
Let
me
alone,
Shirley.
Do
let
me
cry
a
few
minutes;
it
relieves
me."
Miss
Keeldar,
feeling
her
tremble
in
every
limb,
ceased
to
expostulate
with
her.
She
went
out
of
the
shed,
and
left
her
to
weep
in
peace.
It
was
the
best
plan.
In
a
few
minutes
Caroline
rejoined
her,
much
calmer.
She
said,
with
her
natural,
docile,
gentle
manner,
"Come,
Shirley,
we
will
go
home
now.
I
promise
not
to
try
to
see
Robert
again
till
he
asks
for
me.
I
never
will
try
to
push
myself
on
him.
I
thank
you
for
restraining
me
just
now."
"I
did
it
with
a
good
intention,"
returned
Miss
Keeldar.
"Now,
dear
Lina,"
she
continued,
"let
us
turn
our
faces
to
the
cool
morning
breeze,
and
walk
very
quietly
back
to
the
rectory.
We
will
steal
in
as
we
stole
out.
None
shall
know
where
we
have
been
or
what
we
have
seen
to
night;
neither
taunt
nor
misconstruction
can
consequently
molest
us.
To
morrow
we
will
see
Robert,
and
be
of
good
cheer;
but
I
will
say
no
more,
lest
I
should
begin
to
cry
too.
I
seem
hard
towards
you,
but
I
am
not
so."
The
two
girls
met
no
living
soul
on
their
way
back
to
the
rectory.
They
let
themselves
in
noiselessly;
they
stole
upstairs
unheard
the
breaking
morning
gave
them
what
light
they
needed.
Shirley
sought
her
couch
immediately;
and
though
the
room
was
strange
for
she
had
never
slept
at
the
rectory
before
and
though
the
recent
scene
was
one
unparalleled
for
excitement
and
terror
by
any
it
had
hitherto
been
her
lot
to
witness,
yet
scarce
was
her
head
laid
on
the
pillow
ere
a
deep,
refreshing
sleep
closed
her
eyes
and
calmed
her
senses.
Perfect
health
was
Shirley's
enviable
portion.
Though
warm
hearted
and
sympathetic,
she
was
not
nervous;
powerful
emotions
could
rouse
and
sway
without
exhausting
her
spirit.
The
tempest
troubled
and
shook
her
while
it
lasted,
but
it
left
her
elasticity
unbent,
and
her
freshness
quite
unblighted.
As
every
day
brought
her
stimulating
emotion,
so
every
night
yielded
her
recreating
rest.
Caroline
now
watched
her
sleeping,
and
read
the
serenity
of
her
mind
in
the
beauty
of
her
happy
countenance.
For
herself,
being
of
a
different
temperament,
she
could
not
sleep.
The
commonplace
excitement
of
the
tea
drinking
and
school
gathering
would
alone
have
sufficed
to
make
her
restless
all
night;
the
effect
of
the
terrible
drama
which
had
just
been
enacted
before
her
eyes
was
not
likely
to
quit
her
for
days.
It
was
vain
even
to
try
to
retain
a
recumbent
posture;
she
sat
up
by
Shirley's
side,
counting
the
slow
minutes,
and
watching
the
June
sun
mount
the
heavens.
Life
wastes
fast
in
such
vigils
as
Caroline
had
of
late
but
too
often
kept
vigils
during
which
the
mind,
having
no
pleasant
food
to
nourish
it,
no
manna
of
hope,
no
hived
honey
of
joyous
memories,
tries
to
live
on
the
meagre
diet
of
wishes,
and
failing
to
derive
thence
either
delight
or
support,
and
feeling
itself
ready
to
perish
with
craving
want,
turns
to
philosophy,
to
resolution,
to
resignation;
calls
on
all
these
gods
for
aid,
calls
vainly
is
unheard,
unhelped,
and
languishes.
Caroline
was
a
Christian;
therefore
in
trouble
she
framed
many
a
prayer
after
the
Christian
creed,
preferred
it
with
deep
earnestness,
begged
for
patience,
strength,
relief.
This
world,
however,
we
all
know,
is
the
scene
of
trial
and
probation;
and,
for
any
favourable
result
her
petitions
had
yet
wrought,
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
were
unheard
and
unaccepted.
She
believed,
sometimes,
that
God
had
turned
His
face
from
her.
At
moments
she
was
a
Calvinist,
and,
sinking
into
the
gulf
of
religious
despair,
she
saw
darkening
over
her
the
doom
of
reprobation.
Most
people
have
had
a
period
or
periods
in
their
lives
when
they
have
felt
thus
forsaken
when,
having
long
hoped
against
hope,
and
still
seen
the
day
of
fruition
deferred,
their
hearts
have
truly
sickened
within
them.
This
is
a
terrible
hour,
but
it
is
often
that
darkest
point
which
precedes
the
rise
of
day
that
turn
of
the
year
when
the
icy
January
wind
carries
over
the
waste
at
once
the
dirge
of
departing
winter
and
the
prophecy
of
coming
spring.
The
perishing
birds,
however,
cannot
thus
understand
the
blast
before
which
they
shiver;
and
as
little
can
the
suffering
soul
recognize,
in
the
climax
of
its
affliction,
the
dawn
of
its
deliverance.
Yet,
let
whoever
grieves
still
cling
fast
to
love
and
faith
in
God.
God
will
never
deceive,
never
finally
desert
him.
"Whom
He
loveth,
He
chasteneth."
These
words
are
true,
and
should
not
be
forgotten.
The
household
was
astir
at
last;
the
servants
were
up;
the
shutters
were
opened
below.
Caroline,
as
she
quitted
the
couch,
which
had
been
but
a
thorny
one
to
her,
felt
that
revival
of
spirits
which
the
return
of
day,
of
action,
gives
to
all
but
the
wholly
despairing
or
actually
dying.
She
dressed
herself,
as
usual,
carefully,
trying
so
to
arrange
her
hair
and
attire
that
nothing
of
the
forlornness
she
felt
at
heart
should
be
visible
externally.
She
looked
as
fresh
as
Shirley
when
both
were
dressed,
only
that
Miss
Keeldar's
eyes
were
lively,
and
Miss
Helstone's
languid.
"To
day
I
shall
have
much
to
say
to
Moore,"
were
Shirley's
first
words;
and
you
could
see
in
her
face
that
life
was
full
of
interest,
expectation,
and
occupation
for
her.
"He
will
have
to
undergo
cross
examination,"
she
added.
"I
dare
say
he
thinks
he
has
outwitted
me
cleverly.
And
this
is
the
way
men
deal
with
women
still
concealing
danger
from
them
thinking,
I
suppose,
to
spare
them
pain.
They
imagined
we
little
knew
where
they
were
to
night.
We
know
they
little
conjectured
where
we
were.
Men,
I
believe,
fancy
women's
minds
something
like
those
of
children.
Now,
that
is
a
mistake."
This
was
said
as
she
stood
at
the
glass,
training
her
naturally
waved
hair
into
curls,
by
twining
it
round
her
fingers.
She
took
up
the
theme
again
five
minutes
after,
as
Caroline
fastened
her
dress
and
clasped
her
girdle.
"If
men
could
see
us
as
we
really
are,
they
would
be
a
little
amazed;
but
the
cleverest,
the
acutest
men
are
often
under
an
illusion
about
women.
They
do
not
read
them
in
a
true
light;
they
misapprehend
them,
both
for
good
and
evil.
Their
good
woman
is
a
queer
thing,
half
doll,
half
angel;
their
bad
woman
almost
always
a
fiend.
Then
to
hear
them
fall
into
ecstasies
with
each
other's
creations
worshipping
the
heroine
of
such
a
poem,
novel,
drama
thinking
it
fine,
divine!
Fine
and
divine
it
may
be,
but
often
quite
artificial
false
as
the
rose
in
my
best
bonnet
there.
If
I
spoke
all
I
think
on
this
point,
if
I
gave
my
real
opinion
of
some
first
rate
female
characters
in
first
rate
works,
where
should
I
be?
Dead
under
a
cairn
of
avenging
stones
in
half
an
hour."
"Shirley,
you
chatter
so,
I
can't
fasten
you.
Be
still.
And,
after
all,
authors'
heroines
are
almost
as
good
as
authoresses'
heroes."
"Not
at
all.
Women
read
men
more
truly
than
men
read
women.
I'll
prove
that
in
a
magazine
paper
some
day
when
I've
time;
only
it
will
never
be
inserted.
It
will
be
'declined
with
thanks,'
and
left
for
me
at
the
publisher's."
"To
be
sure.
You
could
not
write
cleverly
enough.
You
don't
know
enough.
You
are
not
learned,
Shirley."
"God
knows
I
can't
contradict
you,
Cary;
I'm
as
ignorant
as
a
stone.
There's
one
comfort,
however:
you
are
not
much
better."
They
descended
to
breakfast.
"I
wonder
how
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Hortense
Moore
have
passed
the
night,"
said
Caroline,
as
she
made
the
coffee.
"Selfish
being
that
I
am,
I
never
thought
of
either
of
them
till
just
now.
They
will
have
heard
all
the
tumult,
Fieldhead
and
the
cottage
are
so
near;
and
Hortense
is
timid
in
such
matters
so,
no
doubt,
is
Mrs.
Pryor."
"Take
my
word
for
it,
Lina,
Moore
will
have
contrived
to
get
his
sister
out
of
the
way.
She
went
home
with
Miss
Mann.
He
will
have
quartered
her
there
for
the
night.
As
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
I
own
I
am
uneasy
about
her;
but
in
another
half
hour
we
will
be
with
her."
By
this
time
the
news
of
what
had
happened
at
the
Hollow
was
spread
all
over
the
neighbourhood.
Fanny,
who
had
been
to
Fieldhead
to
fetch
the
milk,
returned
in
panting
haste
with
tidings
that
there
had
been
a
battle
in
the
night
at
Mr.
Moore's
mill,
and
that
some
said
twenty
men
were
killed.
Eliza,
during
Fanny's
absence,
had
been
apprised
by
the
butcher's
boy
that
the
mill
was
burnt
to
the
ground.
Both
women
rushed
into
the
parlour
to
announce
these
terrible
facts
to
the
ladies,
terminating
their
clear
and
accurate
narrative
by
the
assertion
that
they
were
sure
master
must
have
been
in
it
all.
He
and
Thomas,
the
clerk,
they
were
confident,
must
have
gone
last
night
to
join
Mr.
Moore
and
the
soldiers.
Mr.
Malone,
too,
had
not
been
heard
of
at
his
lodgings
since
yesterday
afternoon;
and
Joe
Scott's
wife
and
family
were
in
the
greatest
distress,
wondering
what
had
become
of
their
head.
Scarcely
was
this
information
imparted
when
a
knock
at
the
kitchen
door
announced
the
Fieldhead
errand
boy,
arrived
in
hot
haste,
bearing
a
billet
from
Mrs.
Pryor.
It
was
hurriedly
written,
and
urged
Miss
Keeldar
to
return
directly,
as
the
neighbourhood
and
the
house
seemed
likely
to
be
all
in
confusion,
and
orders
would
have
to
be
given
which
the
mistress
of
the
hall
alone
could
regulate.
In
a
postscript
it
was
entreated
that
Miss
Helstone
might
not
be
left
alone
at
the
rectory.
She
had
better,
it
was
suggested,
accompany
Miss
Keeldar.
"There
are
not
two
opinions
on
that
head,"
said
Shirley,
as
she
tied
on
her
own
bonnet,
and
then
ran
to
fetch
Caroline's.
"But
what
will
Fanny
and
Eliza
do?
And
if
my
uncle
returns?"
"Your
uncle
will
not
return
yet;
he
has
other
fish
to
fry.
He
will
be
galloping
backwards
and
forwards
from
Briarfield
to
Stilbro'
all
day,
rousing
the
magistrates
in
the
court
house
and
the
officers
at
the
barracks;
and
Fanny
and
Eliza
can
have
in
Joe
Scott's
and
the
clerk's
wives
to
bear
them
company.
Besides,
of
course,
there
is
no
real
danger
to
be
apprehended
now.
Weeks
will
elapse
before
the
rioters
can
again
rally,
or
plan
any
other
attempt;
and
I
am
much
mistaken
if
Moore
and
Mr.
Helstone
will
not
take
advantage
of
last
night's
outbreak
to
quell
them
altogether.
They
will
frighten
the
authorities
of
Stilbro'
into
energetic
measures.
I
only
hope
they
will
not
be
too
severe
not
pursue
the
discomfited
too
relentlessly."
"Robert
will
not
be
cruel.
We
saw
that
last
night,"
said
Caroline.
"But
he
will
be
hard,"
retorted
Shirley;
"and
so
will
your
uncle."
As
they
hurried
along
the
meadow
and
plantation
path
to
Fieldhead,
they
saw
the
distant
highway
already
alive
with
an
unwonted
flow
of
equestrians
and
pedestrians,
tending
in
the
direction
of
the
usually
solitary
Hollow.
On
reaching
the
hall,
they
found
the
backyard
gates
open,
and
the
court
and
kitchen
seemed
crowded
with
excited
milk
fetchers
men,
women,
and
children
whom
Mrs.
Gill,
the
housekeeper,
appeared
vainly
persuading
to
take
their
milk
cans
and
depart.
(It
is,
or
was,
by
the
bye,
the
custom
in
the
north
of
England
for
the
cottagers
on
a
country
squire's
estate
to
receive
their
supplies
of
milk
and
butter
from
the
dairy
of
the
manor
house,
on
whose
pastures
a
herd
of
milch
kine
was
usually
fed
for
the
convenience
of
the
neighbourhood.
Miss
Keeldar
owned
such
a
herd
all
deep
dewlapped,
Craven
cows,
reared
on
the
sweet
herbage
and
clear
waters
of
bonny
Airedale;
and
very
proud
she
was
of
their
sleek
aspect
and
high
condition.)
Seeing
now
the
state
of
matters,
and
that
it
was
desirable
to
effect
a
clearance
of
the
premises,
Shirley
stepped
in
amongst
the
gossiping
groups.
She
bade
them
good
morning
with
a
certain
frank,
tranquil
ease
the
natural
characteristic
of
her
manner
when
she
addressed
numbers,
especially
if
those
numbers
belonged
to
the
working
class;
she
was
cooler
amongst
her
equals,
and
rather
proud
to
those
above
her.
She
then
asked
them
if
they
had
all
got
their
milk
measured
out;
and
understanding
that
they
had,
she
further
observed
that
she
"wondered
what
they
were
waiting
for,
then."
"We're
just
talking
a
bit
over
this
battle
there
has
been
at
your
mill,
mistress,"
replied
a
man.
"Talking
a
bit!
Just
like
you!"
said
Shirley.
"It
is
a
queer
thing
all
the
world
is
so
fond
of
talking
over
events.
You
talk
if
anybody
dies
suddenly;
you
talk
if
a
fire
breaks
out;
you
talk
if
a
mill
owner
fails;
you
talk
if
he's
murdered.
What
good
does
your
talking
do?"
There
is
nothing
the
lower
orders
like
better
than
a
little
downright
good
humoured
rating.
Flattery
they
scorn
very
much;
honest
abuse
they
enjoy.
They
call
it
speaking
plainly,
and
take
a
sincere
delight
in
being
the
objects
thereof.
The
homely
harshness
of
Miss
Keeldar's
salutation
won
her
the
ear
of
the
whole
throng
in
a
second.
"We're
no
war
nor
some
'at
is
aboon
us,
are
we?"
asked
a
man,
smiling.
"Nor
a
whit
better.
You
that
should
be
models
of
industry
are
just
as
gossip
loving
as
the
idle.
Fine,
rich
people
that
have
nothing
to
do
may
be
partly
excused
for
trifling
their
time
away;
you
who
have
to
earn
your
bread
with
the
sweat
of
your
brow
are
quite
inexcusable."
"That's
queer,
mistress.
Suld
we
never
have
a
holiday
because
we
work
hard?"
"Never,"
was
the
prompt
answer;
"unless,"
added
the
"mistress,"
with
a
smile
that
half
belied
the
severity
of
her
speech
"unless
you
knew
how
to
make
a
better
use
of
it
than
to
get
together
over
rum
and
tea
if
you
are
women,
or
over
beer
and
pipes
if
you
are
men,
and
talk
scandal
at
your
neighbours'
expense.
Come,
friends,"
she
added,
changing
at
once
from
bluntness
to
courtesy,
"oblige
me
by
taking
your
cans
and
going
home.
I
expect
several
persons
to
call
to
day,
and
it
will
be
inconvenient
to
have
the
avenues
to
the
house
crowded."
Yorkshire
people
are
as
yielding
to
persuasion
as
they
are
stubborn
against
compulsion.
The
yard
was
clear
in
five
minutes.
"Thank
you,
and
good
bye
to
you,
friends,"
said
Shirley,
as
she
closed
the
gates
on
a
quiet
court.
Now,
let
me
hear
the
most
refined
of
cockneys
presume
to
find
fault
with
Yorkshire
manners.
Taken
as
they
ought
to
be,
the
majority
of
the
lads
and
lasses
of
the
West
Riding
are
gentlemen
and
ladies,
every
inch
of
them.
It
is
only
against
the
weak
affectation
and
futile
pomposity
of
a
would
be
aristocrat
they
turn
mutinous.
Entering
by
the
back
way,
the
young
ladies
passed
through
the
kitchen
(or
house,
as
the
inner
kitchen
is
called)
to
the
hall.
Mrs.
Pryor
came
running
down
the
oak
staircase
to
meet
them.
She
was
all
unnerved;
her
naturally
sanguine
complexion
was
pale;
her
usually
placid,
though
timid,
blue
eye
was
wandering,
unsettled,
alarmed.
She
did
not,
however,
break
out
into
any
exclamations,
or
hurried
narrative
of
what
had
happened.
Her
predominant
feeling
had
been
in
the
course
of
the
night,
and
was
now
this
morning,
a
sense
of
dissatisfaction
with
herself
that
she
could
not
feel
firmer,
cooler,
more
equal
to
the
demands
of
the
occasion.
"You
are
aware,"
she
began
with
a
trembling
voice,
and
yet
the
most
conscientious
anxiety
to
avoid
exaggeration
in
what
she
was
about
to
say,
"that
a
body
of
rioters
has
attacked
Mr.
Moore's
mill
to
night.
We
heard
the
firing
and
confusion
very
plainly
here;
we
none
of
us
slept.
It
was
a
sad
night.
The
house
has
been
in
great
bustle
all
the
morning
with
people
coming
and
going.
The
servants
have
applied
to
me
for
orders
and
directions,
which
I
really
did
not
feel
warranted
in
giving.
Mr.
Moore
has,
I
believe,
sent
up
for
refreshments
for
the
soldiers
and
others
engaged
in
the
defence,
for
some
conveniences
also
for
the
wounded.
I
could
not
undertake
the
responsibility
of
giving
orders
or
taking
measures.
I
fear
delay
may
have
been
injurious
in
some
instances;
but
this
is
not
my
house.
You
were
absent,
my
dear
Miss
Keeldar.
What
could
I
do?"
"Were
no
refreshments
sent?"
asked
Shirley,
while
her
countenance,
hitherto
so
clear,
propitious,
and
quiet,
even
while
she
was
rating
the
milk
fetchers,
suddenly
turned
dark
and
warm.
"I
think
not,
my
dear."
"And
nothing
for
the
wounded
no
linen,
no
wine,
no
bedding?"
"I
think
not.
I
cannot
tell
what
Mrs.
Gill
did;
but
it
seemed
impossible
to
me,
at
the
moment,
to
venture
to
dispose
of
your
property
by
sending
supplies
to
soldiers.
Provisions
for
a
company
of
soldiers
sounds
formidable.
How
many
there
are
I
did
not
ask;
but
I
could
not
think
of
allowing
them
to
pillage
the
house,
as
it
were.
I
intended
to
do
what
was
right,
yet
I
did
not
see
the
case
quite
clearly,
I
own."
"It
lies
in
a
nutshell,
notwithstanding.
These
soldiers
have
risked
their
lives
in
defence
of
my
property:
I
suppose
they
have
a
right
to
my
gratitude.
The
wounded
are
our
fellow
creatures:
I
suppose
we
should
aid
them.
Mrs.
Gill!"
She
turned,
and
called
in
a
voice
more
clear
than
soft.
It
rang
through
the
thick
oak
of
the
hall
and
kitchen
doors
more
effectually
than
a
bell's
summons.
Mrs.
Gill,
who
was
deep
in
bread
making,
came
with
hands
and
apron
in
culinary
case,
not
having
dared
to
stop
to
rub
the
dough
from
the
one
or
to
shake
the
flour
from
the
other.
Her
mistress
had
never
called
a
servant
in
that
voice
save
once
before,
and
that
was
when
she
had
seen
from
the
window
Tartar
in
full
tug
with
two
carriers'
dogs,
each
of
them
a
match
for
him
in
size,
if
not
in
courage,
and
their
masters
standing
by,
encouraging
their
animals,
while
hers
was
unbefriended.
Then
indeed
she
had
summoned
John
as
if
the
Day
of
Judgment
were
at
hand.
Nor
had
she
waited
for
the
said
John's
coming,
but
had
walked
out
into
the
lane
bonnetless,
and
after
informing
the
carriers
that
she
held
them
far
less
of
men
than
the
three
brutes
whirling
and
worrying
in
the
dust
before
them,
had
put
her
hands
round
the
thick
neck
of
the
largest
of
the
curs,
and
given
her
whole
strength
to
the
essay
of
choking
it
from
Tartar's
torn
and
bleeding
eye,
just
above
and
below
which
organ
the
vengeful
fangs
were
inserted.
Five
or
six
men
were
presently
on
the
spot
to
help
her,
but
she
never
thanked
one
of
them.
"They
might
have
come
before
if
their
will
had
been
good,"
she
said.
She
had
not
a
word
for
anybody
during
the
rest
of
the
day,
but
sat
near
the
hall
fire
till
evening
watching
and
tending
Tartar,
who
lay
all
gory,
stiff,
and
swelled
on
a
mat
at
her
feet.
She
wept
furtively
over
him
sometimes,
and
murmured
the
softest
words
of
pity
and
endearment,
in
tones
whose
music
the
old,
scarred,
canine
warrior
acknowledged
by
licking
her
hand
or
her
sandal
alternately
with
his
own
red
wounds.
As
to
John,
his
lady
turned
a
cold
shoulder
on
him
for
a
week
afterwards.
Mrs.
Gill,
remembering
this
little
episode,
came
"all
of
a
tremble,"
as
she
said
herself.
In
a
firm,
brief
voice
Miss
Keeldar
proceeded
to
put
questions
and
give
orders.
That
at
such
a
time
Fieldhead
should
have
evinced
the
inhospitality
of
a
miser's
hovel
stung
her
haughty
spirit
to
the
quick;
and
the
revolt
of
its
pride
was
seen
in
the
heaving
of
her
heart,
stirred
stormily
under
the
lace
and
silk
which
veiled
it.
"How
long
is
it
since
that
message
came
from
the
mill?"
"Not
an
hour
yet,
ma'am,"
answered
the
housekeeper
soothingly.
"Not
an
hour!
You
might
almost
as
well
have
said
not
a
day.
They
will
have
applied
elsewhere
by
this
time.
Send
a
man
instantly
down
to
tell
them
that
everything
this
house
contains
is
at
Mr.
Moore's,
Mr.
Helstone's,
and
the
soldiers'
service.
Do
that
first."
While
the
order
was
being
executed,
Shirley
moved
away
from
her
friends,
and
stood
at
the
hall
window,
silent,
unapproachable.
When
Mrs.
Gill
came
back,
she
turned.
The
purple
flush
which
painful
excitement
kindles
on
a
pale
cheek
glowed
on
hers;
the
spark
which
displeasure
lights
in
a
dark
eye
fired
her
glance.
"Let
the
contents
of
the
larder
and
the
wine
cellar
be
brought
up,
put
into
the
hay
carts,
and
driven
down
to
the
Hollow.
If
there
does
not
happen
to
be
much
bread
or
much
meat
in
the
house,
go
to
the
butcher
and
baker,
and
desire
them
to
send
what
they
have.
But
I
will
see
for
myself."
She
moved
off.
"All
will
be
right
soon;
she
will
get
over
it
in
an
hour,"
whispered
Caroline
to
Mrs.
Pryor.
"Go
upstairs,
dear
madam,"
she
added
affectionately,
"and
try
to
be
as
calm
and
easy
as
you
can.
The
truth
is,
Shirley
will
blame
herself
more
than
you
before
the
day
is
over."
By
dint
of
a
few
more
gentle
assurances
and
persuasions,
Miss
Helstone
contrived
to
soothe
the
agitated
lady.
Having
accompanied
her
to
her
apartment,
and
promised
to
rejoin
her
there
when
things
were
settled,
Caroline
left
her
to
see,
as
she
said,
"if
she
could
be
useful."
She
presently
found
that
she
could
be
very
useful;
for
the
retinue
of
servants
at
Fieldhead
was
by
no
means
numerous,
and
just
now
their
mistress
found
plenty
of
occupation
for
all
the
hands
at
her
command,
and
for
her
own
also.
The
delicate
good
nature
and
dexterous
activity
which
Caroline
brought
to
the
aid
of
the
housekeeper
and
maids
all
somewhat
scared
by
their
lady's
unwonted
mood
did
a
world
of
good
at
once;
it
helped
the
assistants
and
appeased
the
directress.
A
chance
glance
and
smile
from
Caroline
moved
Shirley
to
an
answering
smile
directly.
The
former
was
carrying
a
heavy
basket
up
the
cellar
stairs.
"This
is
a
shame!"
cried
Shirley,
running
to
her.
"It
will
strain
your
arm."
She
took
it
from
her,
and
herself
bore
it
out
into
the
yard.
The
cloud
of
temper
was
dispelled
when
she
came
back;
the
flash
in
her
eye
was
melted;
the
shade
on
her
forehead
vanished.
She
resumed
her
usual
cheerful
and
cordial
manner
to
those
about
her,
tempering
her
revived
spirits
with
a
little
of
the
softness
of
shame
at
her
previous
unjust
anger.
She
was
still
superintending
the
lading
of
the
cart,
when
a
gentleman
entered
the
yard
and
approached
her
ere
she
was
aware
of
his
presence.
"I
hope
I
see
Miss
Keeldar
well
this
morning?"
he
said,
examining
with
rather
significant
scrutiny
her
still
flushed
face.
She
gave
him
a
look,
and
then
again
bent
to
her
employment
without
reply.
A
pleasant
enough
smile
played
on
her
lips,
but
she
hid
it.
The
gentleman
repeated
his
salutation,
stooping,
that
it
might
reach
her
ear
with
more
facility.
"Well
enough,
if
she
be
good
enough,"
was
the
answer;
"and
so
is
Mr.
Moore
too,
I
dare
say.
To
speak
truth,
I
am
not
anxious
about
him;
some
slight
mischance
would
be
only
his
just
due.
His
conduct
has
been
we
will
say
strange
just
now,
till
we
have
time
to
characterize
it
by
a
more
exact
epithet.
Meantime,
may
I
ask
what
brings
him
here?"
"Mr.
Helstone
and
I
have
just
received
your
message
that
everything
at
Fieldhead
was
at
our
service.
We
judged,
by
the
unlimited
wording
of
the
gracious
intimation,
that
you
would
be
giving
yourself
too
much
trouble.
I
perceive
our
conjecture
was
correct.
We
are
not
a
regiment,
remember
only
about
half
a
dozen
soldiers
and
as
many
civilians.
Allow
me
to
retrench
something
from
these
too
abundant
supplies."
Miss
Keeldar
blushed,
while
she
laughed
at
her
own
over
eager
generosity
and
most
disproportionate
calculations.
Moore
laughed
too,
very
quietly
though;
and
as
quietly
he
ordered
basket
after
basket
to
be
taken
from
the
cart,
and
remanded
vessel
after
vessel
to
the
cellar.
"The
rector
must
hear
of
this,"
he
said;
"he
will
make
a
good
story
of
it.
What
an
excellent
army
contractor
Miss
Keeldar
would
have
been!"
Again
he
laughed,
adding,
"It
is
precisely
as
I
conjectured."
"You
ought
to
be
thankful,"
said
Shirley,
"and
not
mock
me.
What
could
I
do?
How
could
I
gauge
your
appetites
or
number
your
band?
For
aught
I
knew,
there
might
have
been
fifty
of
you
at
least
to
victual.
You
told
me
nothing;
and
then
an
application
to
provision
soldiers
naturally
suggests
large
ideas."
"It
appears
so,"
remarked
Moore,
levelling
another
of
his
keen,
quiet
glances
at
the
discomfited
Shirley.
"Now,"
he
continued,
addressing
the
carter,
"I
think
you
may
take
what
remains
to
the
Hollow.
Your
load
will
be
somewhat
lighter
than
the
one
Miss
Keeldar
destined
you
to
carry."
As
the
vehicle
rumbled
out
of
the
yard,
Shirley,
rallying
her
spirits,
demanded
what
had
become
of
the
wounded.
"There
was
not
a
single
man
hurt
on
our
side,"
was
the
answer.
"You
were
hurt
yourself,
on
the
temples,"
interposed
a
quick,
low
voice
that
of
Caroline,
who,
having
withdrawn
within
the
shade
of
the
door,
and
behind
the
large
person
of
Mrs.
Gill,
had
till
now
escaped
Moore's
notice.
When
she
spoke,
his
eye
searched
the
obscurity
of
her
retreat.
"Are
you
much
hurt?"
she
inquired.
"As
you
might
scratch
your
finger
with
a
needle
in
sewing."
"Lift
your
hair
and
let
us
see."
He
took
his
hat
off,
and
did
as
he
was
bid,
disclosing
only
a
narrow
slip
of
court
plaster.
Caroline
indicated,
by
a
slight
movement
of
the
head,
that
she
was
satisfied,
and
disappeared
within
the
clear
obscure
of
the
interior.
"How
did
she
know
I
was
hurt?"
asked
Moore.
"By
rumour,
no
doubt.
But
it
is
too
good
in
her
to
trouble
herself
about
you.
For
my
part,
it
was
of
your
victims
I
was
thinking
when
I
inquired
after
the
wounded.
What
damage
have
your
opponents
sustained?"
"One
of
the
rioters,
or
victims
as
you
call
them,
was
killed,
and
six
were
hurt."
"What
have
you
done
with
them?"
"What
you
will
perfectly
approve.
Medical
aid
was
procured
immediately;
and
as
soon
as
we
can
get
a
couple
of
covered
wagons
and
some
clean
straw,
they
will
be
removed
to
Stilbro'."
"Straw!
You
must
have
beds
and
bedding.
I
will
send
my
wagon
directly,
properly
furnished;
and
Mr.
Yorke,
I
am
sure,
will
send
his."
"You
guess
correctly;
he
has
volunteered
already.
And
Mrs.
Yorke
who,
like
you,
seems
disposed
to
regard
the
rioters
as
martyrs,
and
me,
and
especially
Mr.
Helstone,
as
murderers
is
at
this
moment,
I
believe,
most
assiduously
engaged
in
fitting
it
up
with
feather
beds,
pillows,
bolsters,
blankets,
etc.
The
victims
lack
no
attentions,
I
promise
you.
Mr.
Hall,
your
favourite
parson,
has
been
with
them
ever
since
six
o'clock,
exhorting
them,
praying
with
them,
and
even
waiting
on
them
like
any
nurse;
and
Caroline's
good
friend,
Miss
Ainley,
that
very
plain
old
maid,
sent
in
a
stock
of
lint
and
linen,
something
in
the
proportion
of
another
lady's
allowance
of
beef
and
wine."
"That
will
do.
Where
is
your
sister?"
"Well
cared
for.
I
had
her
securely
domiciled
with
Miss
Mann.
This
very
morning
the
two
set
out
for
Wormwood
Wells
[a
noted
watering
place],
and
will
stay
there
some
weeks."
"So
Mr.
Helstone
domiciled
me
at
the
rectory!
Mighty
clever
you
gentlemen
think
you
are!
I
make
you
heartily
welcome
to
the
idea,
and
hope
its
savour,
as
you
chew
the
cud
of
reflection
upon
it,
gives
you
pleasure.
Acute
and
astute,
why
are
you
not
also
omniscient?
How
is
it
that
events
transpire,
under
your
very
noses,
of
which
you
have
no
suspicion?
It
should
be
so,
otherwise
the
exquisite
gratification
of
outmanoeuvring
you
would
be
unknown.
Ah,
friend,
you
may
search
my
countenance,
but
you
cannot
read
it."
Moore,
indeed,
looked
as
if
he
could
not.
"You
think
me
a
dangerous
specimen
of
my
sex.
Don't
you
now?"
"A
peculiar
one,
at
least."
"But
Caroline
is
she
peculiar?"
"In
her
way
yes."
"Her
way!
What
is
her
way?"
"You
know
her
as
well
as
I
do."
"And
knowing
her,
I
assert
that
she
is
neither
eccentric
nor
difficult
of
control.
Is
she?"
"That
depends
"
"However,
there
is
nothing
masculine
about
her?"
"Why
lay
such
emphasis
on
her?
Do
you
consider
her
a
contrast,
in
that
respect,
to
yourself?"
"You
do,
no
doubt;
but
that
does
not
signify.
Caroline
is
neither
masculine,
nor
of
what
they
call
the
spirited
order
of
women."
"I
have
seen
her
flash
out."
"So
have
I,
but
not
with
manly
fire.
It
was
a
short,
vivid,
trembling
glow,
that
shot
up,
shone,
vanished
"
"And
left
her
scared
at
her
own
daring.
You
describe
others
besides
Caroline."
"The
point
I
wish
to
establish
is,
that
Miss
Helstone,
though
gentle,
tractable,
and
candid
enough,
is
still
perfectly
capable
of
defying
even
Mr.
Moore's
penetration."
"What
have
you
and
she
been
doing?"
asked
Moore
suddenly.
"Have
you
had
any
breakfast?"
"What
is
your
mutual
mystery?"
"If
you
are
hungry,
Mrs.
Gill
will
give
you
something
to
eat
here.
Step
into
the
oak
parlour,
and
ring
the
bell.
You
will
be
served
as
if
at
an
inn;
or,
if
you
like
better,
go
back
to
the
Hollow."
"The
alternative
is
not
open
to
me;
I
must
go
back.
Good
morning.
The
first
leisure
I
have
I
will
see
you
again."
While
Shirley
was
talking
with
Moore,
Caroline
rejoined
Mrs.
Pryor
upstairs.
She
found
that
lady
deeply
depressed.
She
would
not
say
that
Miss
Keeldar's
hastiness
had
hurt
her
feelings,
but
it
was
evident
an
inward
wound
galled
her.
To
any
but
a
congenial
nature
she
would
have
seemed
insensible
to
the
quiet,
tender
attentions
by
which
Miss
Helstone
sought
to
impart
solace;
but
Caroline
knew
that,
unmoved
or
slightly
moved
as
she
looked,
she
felt,
valued,
and
was
healed
by
them.
"I
am
deficient
in
self
confidence
and
decision,"
she
said
at
last.
"I
always
have
been
deficient
in
those
qualities.
Yet
I
think
Miss
Keeldar
should
have
known
my
character
well
enough
by
this
time
to
be
aware
that
I
always
feel
an
even
painful
solicitude
to
do
right,
to
act
for
the
best.
The
unusual
nature
of
the
demand
on
my
judgment
puzzled
me,
especially
following
the
alarms
of
the
night.
I
could
not
venture
to
act
promptly
for
another;
but
I
trust
no
serious
harm
will
result
from
my
lapse
of
firmness."
A
gentle
knock
was
here
heard
at
the
door.
It
was
half
opened.
"Caroline,
come
here,"
said
a
low
voice.
Miss
Helstone
went
out.
There
stood
Shirley
in
the
gallery,
looking
contrite,
ashamed,
sorry
as
any
repentant
child.
"How
is
Mrs.
Pryor?"
she
asked.
"Rather
out
of
spirits,"
said
Caroline.
"I
have
behaved
very
shamefully,
very
ungenerously,
very
ungratefully
to
her,"
said
Shirley.
"How
insolent
in
me
to
turn
on
her
thus
for
what,
after
all,
was
no
fault
only
an
excess
of
conscientiousness
on
her
part.
But
I
regret
my
error
most
sincerely.
Tell
her
so,
and
ask
if
she
will
forgive
me."
Caroline
discharged
the
errand
with
heartfelt
pleasure.
Mrs.
Pryor
rose,
came
to
the
door.
She
did
not
like
scenes;
she
dreaded
them
as
all
timid
people
do.
She
said
falteringly,
"Come
in,
my
dear."
Shirley
did
come
in
with
some
impetuosity.
She
threw
her
arms
round
her
governess,
and
while
she
kissed
her
heartily
she
said,
"You
know
you
must
forgive
me,
Mrs.
Pryor.
I
could
not
get
on
at
all
if
there
was
a
misunderstanding
between
you
and
me."
"I
have
nothing
to
forgive,"
was
the
reply.
"We
will
pass
it
over
now,
if
you
please.
The
final
result
of
the
incident
is
that
it
proves
more
plainly
than
ever
how
unequal
I
am
to
certain
crises."
And
that
was
the
painful
feeling
which
would
remain
on
Mrs.
Pryor's
mind.
No
effort
of
Shirley's
or
Caroline's
could
efface
it
thence.
She
could
forgive
her
offending
pupil,
not
her
innocent
self.
Miss
Keeldar,
doomed
to
be
in
constant
request
during
the
morning,
was
presently
summoned
downstairs
again.
The
rector
called
first.
A
lively
welcome
and
livelier
reprimand
were
at
his
service.
He
expected
both,
and,
being
in
high
spirits,
took
them
in
equally
good
part.
In
the
course
of
his
brief
visit
he
quite
forgot
to
ask
after
his
niece;
the
riot,
the
rioters,
the
mill,
the
magistrates,
the
heiress,
absorbed
all
his
thoughts
to
the
exclusion
of
family
ties.
He
alluded
to
the
part
himself
and
curate
had
taken
in
the
defence
of
the
Hollow.
"The
vials
of
pharisaical
wrath
will
be
emptied
on
our
heads
for
our
share
in
this
business,"
he
said;
"but
I
defy
every
calumniator.
I
was
there
only
to
support
the
law,
to
play
my
part
as
a
man
and
a
Briton;
which
characters
I
deem
quite
compatible
with
those
of
the
priest
and
Levite,
in
their
highest
sense.
Your
tenant
Moore,"
he
went
on,
"has
won
my
approbation.
A
cooler
commander
I
would
not
wish
to
see,
nor
a
more
determined.
Besides,
the
man
has
shown
sound
judgment
and
good
sense
first,
in
being
thoroughly
prepared
for
the
event
which
has
taken
place;
and
subsequently,
when
his
well
concerted
plans
had
secured
him
success,
in
knowing
how
to
use
without
abusing
his
victory.
Some
of
the
magistrates
are
now
well
frightened,
and,
like
all
cowards,
show
a
tendency
to
be
cruel.
Moore
restrains
them
with
admirable
prudence.
He
has
hitherto
been
very
unpopular
in
the
neighbourhood;
but,
mark
my
words,
the
tide
of
opinion
will
now
take
a
turn
in
his
favour.
People
will
find
out
that
they
have
not
appreciated
him,
and
will
hasten
to
remedy
their
error;
and
he,
when
he
perceives
the
public
disposed
to
acknowledge
his
merits,
will
show
a
more
gracious
mien
than
that
with
which
he
has
hitherto
favoured
us."
Mr.
Helstone
was
about
to
add
to
this
speech
some
half
jesting,
half
serious
warnings
to
Miss
Keeldar
on
the
subject
of
her
rumoured
partiality
for
her
talented
tenant,
when
a
ring
at
the
door,
announcing
another
caller,
checked
his
raillery;
and
as
that
other
caller
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
white
haired
elderly
gentleman,
with
a
rather
truculent
countenance
and
disdainful
eye
in
short,
our
old
acquaintance,
and
the
rector's
old
enemy,
Mr.
Yorke
the
priest
and
Levite
seized
his
hat,
and
with
the
briefest
of
adieus
to
Miss
Keeldar
and
the
sternest
of
nods
to
her
guest
took
an
abrupt
leave.
Mr.
Yorke
was
in
no
mild
mood,
and
in
no
measured
terms
did
he
express
his
opinion
on
the
transaction
of
the
night.
Moore,
the
magistrates,
the
soldiers,
the
mob
leaders,
each
and
all
came
in
for
a
share
of
his
invectives;
but
he
reserved
his
strongest
epithets
and
real
racy
Yorkshire
Doric
adjectives
they
were
for
the
benefit
of
the
fighting
parsons,
the
"sanguinary,
demoniac"
rector
and
curate.
According
to
him,
the
cup
of
ecclesiastical
guilt
was
now
full
indeed.
"The
church,"
he
said,
"was
in
a
bonny
pickle
now.
It
was
time
it
came
down
when
parsons
took
to
swaggering
amang
soldiers,
blazing
away
wi'
bullet
and
gunpowder,
taking
the
lives
of
far
honester
men
than
themselves."
"What
would
Moore
have
done
if
nobody
had
helped
him?"
asked
Shirley.
"Drunk
as
he'd
brewed,
eaten
as
he'd
baked."
"Which
means
you
would
have
left
him
by
himself
to
face
that
mob.
Good!
He
has
plenty
of
courage,
but
the
greatest
amount
of
gallantry
that
ever
garrisoned
one
human
breast
could
scarce
avail
against
two
hundred."
"He
had
the
soldiers,
those
poor
slaves
who
hire
out
their
own
blood
and
spill
other
folk's
for
money."
"You
abuse
soldiers
almost
as
much
as
you
abuse
clergymen.
All
who
wear
red
coats
are
national
refuse
in
your
eyes,
and
all
who
wear
black
are
national
swindlers.
Mr.
Moore,
according
to
you,
did
wrong
to
get
military
aid,
and
he
did
still
worse
to
accept
of
any
other
aid.
Your
way
of
talking
amounts
to
this:
he
should
have
abandoned
his
mill
and
his
life
to
the
rage
of
a
set
of
misguided
madmen,
and
Mr.
Helstone
and
every
other
gentleman
in
the
parish
should
have
looked
on,
and
seen
the
building
razed
and
its
owner
slaughtered,
and
never
stirred
a
finger
to
save
either."
"If
Moore
had
behaved
to
his
men
from
the
beginning
as
a
master
ought
to
behave,
they
never
would
have
entertained
their
present
feelings
towards
him."
"Easy
for
you
to
talk,"
exclaimed
Miss
Keeldar,
who
was
beginning
to
wax
warm
in
her
tenant's
cause
"you,
whose
family
have
lived
at
Briarmains
for
six
generations,
to
whose
person
the
people
have
been
accustomed
for
fifty
years,
who
know
all
their
ways,
prejudices,
and
preferences
easy,
indeed,
for
you
to
act
so
as
to
avoid
offending
them.
But
Mr.
Moore
came
a
stranger
into
the
district;
he
came
here
poor
and
friendless,
with
nothing
but
his
own
energies
to
back
him,
nothing
but
his
honour,
his
talent,
and
his
industry
to
make
his
way
for
him.
A
monstrous
crime
indeed
that,
under
such
circumstances,
he
could
not
popularize
his
naturally
grave,
quiet
manners
all
at
once;
could
not
be
jocular,
and
free,
and
cordial
with
a
strange
peasantry,
as
you
are
with
your
fellow
townsmen!
An
unpardonable
transgression
that
when
he
introduced
improvements
he
did
not
go
about
the
business
in
quite
the
most
politic
way,
did
not
graduate
his
changes
as
delicately
as
a
rich
capitalist
might
have
done!
For
errors
of
this
sort
is
he
to
be
the
victim
of
mob
outrage?
Is
he
to
be
denied
even
the
privilege
of
defending
himself?
Are
those
who
have
the
hearts
of
men
in
their
breasts
(and
Mr.
Helstone,
say
what
you
will
of
him,
has
such
a
heart)
to
be
reviled
like
malefactors
because
they
stand
by
him,
because
they
venture
to
espouse
the
cause
of
one
against
two
hundred?"
"Come,
come
now,
be
cool,"
said
Mr.
Yorke,
smiling
at
the
earnestness
with
which
Shirley
multiplied
her
rapid
questions.
"Cool!
Must
I
listen
coolly
to
downright
nonsense
to
dangerous
nonsense?
No.
I
like
you
very
well,
Mr.
Yorke,
as
you
know,
but
I
thoroughly
dislike
some
of
your
principles.
All
that
cant
excuse
me,
but
I
repeat
the
word
all
that
cant
about
soldiers
and
parsons
is
most
offensive
in
my
ears.
All
ridiculous,
irrational
crying
up
of
one
class,
whether
the
same
be
aristocrat
or
democrat
all
howling
down
of
another
class,
whether
clerical
or
military
all
exacting
injustice
to
individuals,
whether
monarch
or
mendicant
is
really
sickening
to
me;
all
arraying
of
ranks
against
ranks,
all
party
hatreds,
all
tyrannies
disguised
as
liberties,
I
reject
and
wash
my
hands
of.
You
think
you
are
a
philanthropist;
you
think
you
are
an
advocate
of
liberty;
but
I
will
tell
you
this
Mr.
Hall,
the
parson
of
Nunnely,
is
a
better
friend
both
of
man
and
freedom
than
Hiram
Yorke,
the
reformer
of
Briarfield."
From
a
man
Mr.
Yorke
would
not
have
borne
this
language
very
patiently,
nor
would
he
have
endured
it
from
some
women;
but
he
accounted
Shirley
both
honest
and
pretty,
and
her
plain
spoken
ire
amused
him.
Besides,
he
took
a
secret
pleasure
in
hearing
her
defend
her
tenant,
for
we
have
already
intimated
he
had
Robert
Moore's
interest
very
much
at
heart.
Moreover,
if
he
wished
to
avenge
himself
for
her
severity,
he
knew
the
means
lay
in
his
power:
a
word,
he
believed,
would
suffice
to
tame
and
silence
her,
to
cover
her
frank
forehead
with
the
rosy
shadow
of
shame,
and
veil
the
glow
of
her
eye
under
down
drooped
lid
and
lash.
"What
more
hast
thou
to
say?"
he
inquired,
as
she
paused,
rather,
it
appeared,
to
take
breath
than
because
her
subject
or
her
zeal
was
exhausted.
"Say,
Mr.
Yorke!"
was
the
answer,
the
speaker
meantime
walking
fast
from
wall
to
wall
of
the
oak
parlour
"say?
I
have
a
great
deal
to
say,
if
I
could
get
it
out
in
lucid
order,
which
I
never
can
do.
I
have
to
say
that
your
views,
and
those
of
most
extreme
politicians,
are
such
as
none
but
men
in
an
irresponsible
position
can
advocate;
that
they
are
purely
opposition
views,
meant
only
to
be
talked
about,
and
never
intended
to
be
acted
on.
Make
you
Prime
Minister
of
England
to
morrow,
and
you
would
have
to
abandon
them.
You
abuse
Moore
for
defending
his
mill.
Had
you
been
in
Moore's
place
you
could
not
with
honour
or
sense
have
acted
otherwise
than
he
acted.
You
abuse
Mr.
Helstone
for
everything
he
does.
Mr.
Helstone
has
his
faults;
he
sometimes
does
wrong,
but
oftener
right.
Were
you
ordained
vicar
of
Briarfield,
you
would
find
it
no
easy
task
to
sustain
all
the
active
schemes
for
the
benefit
of
the
parish
planned
and
persevered
in
by
your
predecessor.
I
wonder
people
cannot
judge
more
fairly
of
each
other
and
themselves.
When
I
hear
Messrs.
Malone
and
Donne
chatter
about
the
authority
of
the
church,
the
dignity
and
claims
of
the
priesthood,
the
deference
due
to
them
as
clergymen;
when
I
hear
the
outbreaks
of
their
small
spite
against
Dissenters;
when
I
witness
their
silly,
narrow
jealousies
and
assumptions;
when
their
palaver
about
forms,
and
traditions,
and
superstitions
is
sounding
in
my
ear;
when
I
behold
their
insolent
carriage
to
the
poor,
their
often
base
servility
to
the
rich
I
think
the
Establishment
is
indeed
in
a
poor
way,
and
both
she
and
her
sons
appear
in
the
utmost
need
of
reformation.
Turning
away
distressed
from
minster
tower
and
village
spire
ay,
as
distressed
as
a
churchwarden
who
feels
the
exigence
of
white
wash
and
has
not
wherewithal
to
purchase
lime
I
recall
your
senseless
sarcasms
on
the
'fat
bishops,'
the
'pampered
parsons,'
'old
mother
church,'
etc.
I
remember
your
strictures
on
all
who
differ
from
you,
your
sweeping
condemnation
of
classes
and
individuals,
without
the
slightest
allowance
made
for
circumstances
or
temptations;
and
then,
Mr.
Yorke,
doubt
clutches
my
inmost
heart
as
to
whether
men
exist
clement,
reasonable,
and
just
enough
to
be
entrusted
with
the
task
of
reform.
I
don't
believe
you
are
of
the
number."
"You
have
an
ill
opinion
of
me,
Miss
Shirley.
You
never
told
me
so
much
of
your
mind
before."
"I
never
had
an
opening.
But
I
have
sat
on
Jessy's
stool
by
your
chair
in
the
back
parlour
at
Briarmains,
for
evenings
together,
listening
excitedly
to
your
talk,
half
admiring
what
you
said,
and
half
rebelling
against
it.
I
think
you
a
fine
old
Yorkshireman,
sir.
I
am
proud
to
have
been
born
in
the
same
county
and
parish
as
yourself.
Truthful,
upright,
independent
you
are,
as
a
rock
based
below
seas;
but
also
you
are
harsh,
rude,
narrow,
and
merciless."
"Not
to
the
poor,
lass,
nor
to
the
meek
of
the
earth;
only
to
the
proud
and
high
minded."
"And
what
right
have
you,
sir,
to
make
such
distinctions?
A
prouder,
a
higher
minded
man
than
yourself
does
not
exist.
You
find
it
easy
to
speak
comfortably
to
your
inferiors;
you
are
too
haughty,
too
ambitious,
too
jealous
to
be
civil
to
those
above
you.
But
you
are
all
alike.
Helstone
also
is
proud
and
prejudiced.
Moore,
though
juster
and
more
considerate
than
either
you
or
the
rector,
is
still
haughty,
stern,
and,
in
a
public
sense,
selfish.
It
is
well
there
are
such
men
as
Mr.
Hall
to
be
found
occasionally
men
of
large
and
kind
hearts,
who
can
love
their
whole
race,
who
can
forgive
others
for
being
richer,
more
prosperous,
or
more
powerful
than
they
are.
Such
men
may
have
less
originality,
less
force
of
character
than
you,
but
they
are
better
friends
to
mankind."
"And
when
is
it
to
be?"
said
Mr.
Yorke,
now
rising.
"When
is
what
to
be?"
"The
wedding."
"Whose
wedding?"
"Only
that
of
Robert
Gerard
Moore,
Esq.,
of
Hollow's
Cottage,
with
Miss
Keeldar,
daughter
and
heiress
of
the
late
Charles
Cave
Keeldar
of
Fieldhead
Hall."
Shirley
gazed
at
the
questioner
with
rising
colour.
But
the
light
in
her
eye
was
not
faltering;
it
shone
steadily
yes,
it
burned
deeply.
"That
is
your
revenge,"
she
said
slowly;
then
added,
"Would
it
be
a
bad
match,
unworthy
of
the
late
Charles
Cave
Keeldar's
representative?"
"My
lass,
Moore
is
a
gentleman;
his
blood
is
pure
and
ancient
as
mine
or
thine."
"And
we
two
set
store
by
ancient
blood?
We
have
family
pride,
though
one
of
us
at
least
is
a
republican?"
Yorke
bowed
as
he
stood
before
her.
His
lips
were
mute,
but
his
eye
confessed
the
impeachment.
Yes,
he
had
family
pride;
you
saw
it
in
his
whole
bearing.
"Moore
is
a
gentleman,"
echoed
Shirley,
lifting
her
head
with
glad
grace.
She
checked
herself.
Words
seemed
crowding
to
her
tongue.
She
would
not
give
them
utterance;
but
her
look
spoke
much
at
the
moment.
What,
Yorke
tried
to
read,
but
could
not.
The
language
was
there,
visible,
but
untranslatable
a
poem,
a
fervid
lyric,
in
an
unknown
tongue.
It
was
not
a
plain
story,
however,
no
simple
gush
of
feeling,
no
ordinary
love
confession
that
was
obvious.
It
was
something
other,
deeper,
more
intricate
than
he
guessed
at.
He
felt
his
revenge
had
not
struck
home.
He
felt
that
Shirley
triumphed.
She
held
him
at
fault,
baffled,
puzzled.
She
enjoyed
the
moment,
not
he.
"And
if
Moore
is
a
gentleman,
you
can
be
only
a
lady;
therefore
"
"Therefore
there
would
be
no
inequality
in
our
union."
"None."
"Thank
you
for
your
approbation.
Will
you
give
me
away
when
I
relinquish
the
name
of
Keeldar
for
that
of
Moore?"
Mr.
Yorke,
instead
of
replying,
gazed
at
her
much
puzzled.
He
could
not
divine
what
her
look
signified
whether
she
spoke
in
earnest
or
in
jest.
There
were
purpose
and
feeling,
banter
and
scoff,
playing,
mingled,
on
her
mobile
lineaments.
"I
don't
understand
thee,"
he
said,
turning
away.
She
laughed.
"Take
courage,
sir;
you
are
not
singular
in
your
ignorance.
But
I
suppose
if
Moore
understands
me
that
will
do,
will
it
not?"
"Moore
may
settle
his
own
matters
henceforward
for
me;
I'll
neither
meddle
nor
make
with
them
further."
A
new
thought
crossed
her.
Her
countenance
changed
magically.
With
a
sudden
darkening
of
the
eye
and
austere
fixing
of
the
features
she
demanded,
"Have
you
been
asked
to
interfere?
Are
you
questioning
me
as
another's
proxy?"
"The
Lord
save
us!
Whoever
weds
thee
must
look
about
him!
Keep
all
your
questions
for
Robert;
I'll
answer
no
more
on
'em.
Good
day,
lassie!"
The
day
being
fine,
or
at
least
fair
for
soft
clouds
curtained
the
sun,
and
a
dim
but
not
chill
or
waterish
haze
slept
blue
on
the
hills
Caroline,
while
Shirley
was
engaged
with
her
callers,
had
persuaded
Mrs.
Pryor
to
assume
her
bonnet
and
summer
shawl,
and
to
take
a
walk
with
her
up
towards
the
narrow
end
of
the
Hollow.
Here
the
opposing
sides
of
the
glen,
approaching
each
other
and
becoming
clothed
with
brushwood
and
stunted
oaks,
formed
a
wooded
ravine,
at
the
bottom
of
which
ran
the
mill
stream,
in
broken,
unquiet
course,
struggling
with
many
stones,
chafing
against
rugged
banks,
fretting
with
gnarled
tree
roots,
foaming,
gurgling,
battling
as
it
went.
Here,
when
you
had
wandered
half
a
mile
from
the
mill,
you
found
a
sense
of
deep
solitude
found
it
in
the
shade
of
unmolested
trees,
received
it
in
the
singing
of
many
birds,
for
which
that
shade
made
a
home.
This
was
no
trodden
way.
The
freshness
of
the
wood
flowers
attested
that
foot
of
man
seldom
pressed
them;
the
abounding
wild
roses
looked
as
if
they
budded,
bloomed,
and
faded
under
the
watch
of
solitude,
as
if
in
a
sultan's
harem.
Here
you
saw
the
sweet
azure
of
blue
bells,
and
recognized
in
pearl
white
blossoms,
spangling
the
grass,
a
humble
type
of
some
starlit
spot
in
space.
Mrs.
Pryor
liked
a
quiet
walk.
She
ever
shunned
high
roads,
and
sought
byways
and
lonely
lanes.
One
companion
she
preferred
to
total
solitude,
for
in
solitude
she
was
nervous;
a
vague
fear
of
annoying
encounters
broke
the
enjoyment
of
quite
lonely
rambles.
But
she
feared
nothing
with
Caroline.
When
once
she
got
away
from
human
habitations,
and
entered
the
still
demesne
of
nature
accompanied
by
this
one
youthful
friend,
a
propitious
change
seemed
to
steal
over
her
mind
and
beam
in
her
countenance.
When
with
Caroline
and
Caroline
only
her
heart,
you
would
have
said,
shook
off
a
burden,
her
brow
put
aside
a
veil,
her
spirits
too
escaped
from
a
restraint.
With
her
she
was
cheerful;
with
her,
at
times,
she
was
tender;
to
her
she
would
impart
her
knowledge,
reveal
glimpses
of
her
experience,
give
her
opportunities
for
guessing
what
life
she
had
lived,
what
cultivation
her
mind
had
received,
of
what
calibre
was
her
intelligence,
how
and
where
her
feelings
were
vulnerable.
To
day,
for
instance,
as
they
walked
along,
Mrs.
Pryor
talked
to
her
companion
about
the
various
birds
singing
in
the
trees,
discriminated
their
species,
and
said
something
about
their
habits
and
peculiarities.
English
natural
history
seemed
familiar
to
her.
All
the
wild
flowers
round
their
path
were
recognized
by
her;
tiny
plants
springing
near
stones
and
peeping
out
of
chinks
in
old
walls
plants
such
as
Caroline
had
scarcely
noticed
before
received
a
name
and
an
intimation
of
their
properties.
It
appeared
that
she
had
minutely
studied
the
botany
of
English
fields
and
woods.
Having
reached
the
head
of
the
ravine,
they
sat
down
together
on
a
ledge
of
gray
and
mossy
rock
jutting
from
the
base
of
a
steep
green
hill
which
towered
above
them.
She
looked
round
her,
and
spoke
of
the
neighbourhood
as
she
had
once
before
seen
it
long
ago.
She
alluded
to
its
changes,
and
compared
its
aspect
with
that
of
other
parts
of
England,
revealing
in
quiet,
unconscious
touches
of
description
a
sense
of
the
picturesque,
an
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
or
commonplace,
a
power
of
comparing
the
wild
with
the
cultured,
the
grand
with
the
tame,
that
gave
to
her
discourse
a
graphic
charm
as
pleasant
as
it
was
unpretending.
The
sort
of
reverent
pleasure
with
which
Caroline
listened
so
sincere,
so
quiet,
yet
so
evident
stirred
the
elder
lady's
faculties
to
gentle
animation.
Rarely,
probably,
had
she,
with
her
chill,
repellent
outside,
her
diffident
mien,
and
incommunicative
habits,
known
what
it
was
to
excite
in
one
whom
she
herself
could
love
feelings
of
earnest
affection
and
admiring
esteem.
Delightful,
doubtless,
was
the
consciousness
that
a
young
girl
towards
whom
it
seemed,
judging
by
the
moved
expression
of
her
eyes
and
features,
her
heart
turned
with
almost
a
fond
impulse,
looked
up
to
her
as
an
instructor,
and
clung
to
her
as
a
friend.
With
a
somewhat
more
marked
accent
of
interest
than
she
often
permitted
herself
to
use,
she
said,
as
she
bent
towards
her
youthful
companion,
and
put
aside
from
her
forehead
a
pale
brown
curl
which
had
strayed
from
the
confining
comb,
"I
do
hope
this
sweet
air
blowing
from
the
hill
will
do
you
good,
my
dear
Caroline.
I
wish
I
could
see
something
more
of
colour
in
these
cheeks;
but
perhaps
you
were
never
florid?"
"I
had
red
cheeks
once,"
returned
Miss
Helstone,
smiling.
"I
remember
a
year
two
years
ago
when
I
used
to
look
in
the
glass,
I
saw
a
different
face
there
to
what
I
see
now
rounder
and
rosier.
But
when
we
are
young,"
added
the
girl
of
eighteen,
"our
minds
are
careless
and
our
lives
easy."
"Do
you,"
continued
Mrs.
Pryor,
mastering
by
an
effort
that
tyrant
timidity
which
made
it
difficult
for
her,
even
under
present
circumstances,
to
attempt
the
scrutiny
of
another's
heart
"do
you,
at
your
age,
fret
yourself
with
cares
for
the
future?
Believe
me,
you
had
better
not.
Let
the
morrow
take
thought
for
the
things
of
itself."
"True,
dear
madam.
It
is
not
over
the
future
I
pine.
The
evil
of
the
day
is
sometimes
oppressive
too
oppressive
and
I
long
to
escape
it."
"That
is
the
evil
of
the
day
that
is
your
uncle
perhaps
is
not
you
find
it
difficult
to
understand
he
does
not
appreciate
"
Mrs.
Pryor
could
not
complete
her
broken
sentences;
she
could
not
manage
to
put
the
question
whether
Mr.
Helstone
was
too
harsh
with
his
niece.
But
Caroline
comprehended.
"Oh,
that
is
nothing,"
she
replied.
"My
uncle
and
I
get
on
very
well.
We
never
quarrel
I
don't
call
him
harsh
he
never
scolds
me.
Sometimes
I
wish
somebody
in
the
world
loved
me,
but
I
cannot
say
that
I
particularly
wish
him
to
have
more
affection
for
me
than
he
has.
As
a
child,
I
should
perhaps
have
felt
the
want
of
attention,
only
the
servants
were
very
kind
to
me;
but
when
people
are
long
indifferent
to
us,
we
grow
indifferent
to
their
indifference.
It
is
my
uncle's
way
not
to
care
for
women
and
girls,
unless
they
be
ladies
that
he
meets
in
company.
He
could
not
alter,
and
I
have
no
wish
that
he
should
alter,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned.
I
believe
it
would
merely
annoy
and
frighten
me
were
he
to
be
affectionate
towards
me
now.
But
you
know,
Mrs.
Pryor,
it
is
scarcely
living
to
measure
time
as
I
do
at
the
rectory.
The
hours
pass,
and
I
get
them
over
somehow,
but
I
do
not
live.
I
endure
existence,
but
I
rarely
enjoy
it.
Since
Miss
Keeldar
and
you
came
I
have
been
I
was
going
to
say
happier,
but
that
would
be
untrue."
She
paused.
"How
untrue?
You
are
fond
of
Miss
Keeldar,
are
you
not,
my
dear?"
"Very
fond
of
Shirley.
I
both
like
and
admire
her.
But
I
am
painfully
circumstanced.
For
a
reason
I
cannot
explain
I
want
to
go
away
from
this
place,
and
to
forget
it."
"You
told
me
before
you
wished
to
be
a
governess;
but,
my
dear,
if
you
remember,
I
did
not
encourage
the
idea.
I
have
been
a
governess
myself
great
part
of
my
life.
In
Miss
Keeldar's
acquaintance
I
esteem
myself
most
fortunate.
Her
talents
and
her
really
sweet
disposition
have
rendered
my
office
easy
to
me;
but
when
I
was
young,
before
I
married,
my
trials
were
severe,
poignant.
I
should
not
like
a
I
should
not
like
you
to
endure
similar
ones.
It
was
my
lot
to
enter
a
family
of
considerable
pretensions
to
good
birth
and
mental
superiority,
and
the
members
of
which
also
believed
that
'on
them
was
perceptible'
an
unusual
endowment
of
the
'Christian
graces;'
that
all
their
hearts
were
regenerate,
and
their
spirits
in
a
peculiar
state
of
discipline.
I
was
early
given
to
understand
that
'as
I
was
not
their
equal,'
so
I
could
not
expect
'to
have
their
sympathy.'
It
was
in
no
sort
concealed
from
me
that
I
was
held
a
'burden
and
a
restraint
in
society.'
The
gentlemen,
I
found,
regarded
me
as
a
'tabooed
woman,'
to
whom
'they
were
interdicted
from
granting
the
usual
privileges
of
the
sex,'
and
yet
'who
annoyed
them
by
frequently
crossing
their
path.'
The
ladies
too
made
it
plain
that
they
thought
me
'a
bore.'
The
servants,
it
was
signified,
'detested
me;'
why,
I
could
never
clearly
comprehend.
My
pupils,
I
was
told,
'however
much
they
might
love
me,
and
how
deep
soever
the
interest
I
might
take
in
them,
could
not
be
my
friends.'
It
was
intimated
that
I
must
'live
alone,
and
never
transgress
the
invisible
but
rigid
line
which
established
the
difference
between
me
and
my
employers.'
My
life
in
this
house
was
sedentary,
solitary,
constrained,
joyless,
toilsome.
The
dreadful
crushing
of
the
animal
spirits,
the
ever
prevailing
sense
of
friendlessness
and
homelessness
consequent
on
this
state
of
things
began
ere
long
to
produce
mortal
effects
on
my
constitution.
I
sickened.
The
lady
of
the
house
told
me
coolly
I
was
the
victim
of
'wounded
vanity.'
She
hinted
that
if
I
did
not
make
an
effort
to
quell
my
'ungodly
discontent,'
to
cease
'murmuring
against
God's
appointment,'
and
to
cultivate
the
profound
humility
befitting
my
station,
my
mind
would
very
likely
'go
to
pieces'
on
the
rock
that
wrecked
most
of
my
sisterhood
morbid
self
esteem
and
that
I
should
die
an
inmate
of
a
lunatic
asylum.
"I
said
nothing
to
Mrs.
Hardman
it
would
have
been
useless;
but
to
her
eldest
daughter
I
one
day
dropped
a
few
observations,
which
were
answered
thus.
There
were
hardships,
she
allowed,
in
the
position
of
a
governess.
'Doubtless
they
had
their
trials;
but,'
she
averred,
with
a
manner
it
makes
me
smile
now
to
recall
'but
it
must
be
so.
She'
(Miss
H.)
'had
neither
view,
hope,
nor
wish
to
see
these
things
remedied;
for
in
the
inherent
constitution
of
English
habits,
feelings,
and
prejudices
there
was
no
possibility
that
they
should
be.
Governesses,'
she
observed,
'must
ever
be
kept
in
a
sort
of
isolation.
It
is
the
only
means
of
maintaining
that
distance
which
the
reserve
of
English
manners
and
the
decorum
of
English
families
exact.'
"I
remember
I
sighed
as
Miss
Hardman
quitted
my
bedside.
She
caught
the
sound,
and
turning,
said
severely,
'I
fear,
Miss
Grey,
you
have
inherited
in
fullest
measure
the
worst
sin
of
our
fallen
nature
the
sin
of
pride.
You
are
proud,
and
therefore
you
are
ungrateful
too.
Mamma
pays
you
a
handsome
salary,
and
if
you
had
average
sense
you
would
thankfully
put
up
with
much
that
is
fatiguing
to
do
and
irksome
to
bear,
since
it
is
so
well
made
worth
your
while.'
"Miss
Hardman,
my
love,
was
a
very
strong
minded
young
lady,
of
most
distinguished
talents.
The
aristocracy
are
decidedly
a
very
superior
class,
you
know,
both
physically,
and
morally,
and
mentally;
as
a
high
Tory
I
acknowledge
that.
I
could
not
describe
the
dignity
of
her
voice
and
mien
as
she
addressed
me
thus;
still,
I
fear
she
was
selfish,
my
dear.
I
would
never
wish
to
speak
ill
of
my
superiors
in
rank,
but
I
think
she
was
a
little
selfish."
"I
remember,"
continued
Mrs.
Pryor,
after
a
pause,
"another
of
Miss
H.'s
observations,
which
she
would
utter
with
quite
a
grand
air.
'WE,'
she
would
say
'WE
need
the
imprudences,
extravagances,
mistakes,
and
crimes
of
a
certain
number
of
fathers
to
sow
the
seed
from
which
WE
reap
the
harvest
of
governesses.
The
daughters
of
trades
people,
however
well
educated,
must
necessarily
be
underbred,
and
as
such
unfit
to
be
inmates
of
OUR
dwellings,
or
guardians
of
OUR
children's
minds
and
persons.
WE
shall
ever
prefer
to
place
those
about
OUR
offspring
who
have
been
born
and
bred
with
somewhat
of
the
same
refinement
as
OURSELVES.'"
"Miss
Hardman
must
have
thought
herself
something
better
than
her
fellow
creatures,
ma'am,
since
she
held
that
their
calamities,
and
even
crimes,
were
necessary
to
minister
to
her
convenience.
You
say
she
was
religious.
Her
religion
must
have
been
that
of
the
Pharisee
who
thanked
God
that
he
was
not
as
other
men
are,
nor
even
as
that
publican."
"My
dear,
we
will
not
discuss
the
point.
I
should
be
the
last
person
to
wish
to
instil
into
your
mind
any
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
with
your
lot
in
life,
or
any
sentiment
of
envy
or
insubordination
towards
your
superiors.
Implicit
submission
to
authorities,
scrupulous
deference
to
our
betters
(under
which
term
I,
of
course,
include
the
higher
classes
of
society),
are,
in
my
opinion,
indispensable
to
the
well
being
of
every
community.
All
I
mean
to
say,
my
dear,
is
that
you
had
better
not
attempt
to
be
a
governess,
as
the
duties
of
the
position
would
be
too
severe
for
your
constitution.
Not
one
word
of
disrespect
would
I
breathe
towards
either
Mrs.
or
Miss
Hardman;
only,
recalling
my
own
experience,
I
cannot
but
feel
that,
were
you
to
fall
under
auspices
such
as
theirs,
you
would
contend
a
while
courageously
with
your
doom,
then
you
would
pine
and
grow
too
weak
for
your
work;
you
would
come
home
if
you
still
had
a
home
broken
down.
Those
languishing
years
would
follow
of
which
none
but
the
invalid
and
her
immediate
friends
feel
the
heart
sickness
and
know
the
burden.
Consumption
or
decline
would
close
the
chapter.
Such
is
the
history
of
many
a
life.
I
would
not
have
it
yours.
My
dear,
we
will
now
walk
about
a
little,
if
you
please."
They
both
rose,
and
slowly
paced
a
green
natural
terrace
bordering
the
chasm.
"My
dear,"
ere
long
again
began
Mrs.
Pryor,
a
sort
of
timid,
embarrassed
abruptness
marking
her
manner
as
she
spoke,
"the
young,
especially
those
to
whom
nature
has
been
favourable,
often
frequently
anticipate
look
forward
to
to
marriage
as
the
end,
the
goal
of
their
hopes."
And
she
stopped.
Caroline
came
to
her
relief
with
promptitude,
showing
a
great
deal
more
self
possession
and
courage
than
herself
on
the
formidable
topic
now
broached.
"They
do,
and
naturally,"
she
replied,
with
a
calm
emphasis
that
startled
Mrs.
Pryor.
"They
look
forward
to
marriage
with
some
one
they
love
as
the
brightest,
the
only
bright
destiny
that
can
await
them.
Are
they
wrong?"
"Oh,
my
dear!"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Pryor,
clasping
her
hands;
and
again
she
paused.
Caroline
turned
a
searching,
an
eager
eye
on
the
face
of
her
friend:
that
face
was
much
agitated.
"My
dear,"
she
murmured,
"life
is
an
illusion."
"But
not
love!
Love
is
real
the
most
real,
the
most
lasting,
the
sweetest
and
yet
the
bitterest
thing
we
know."
"My
dear,
it
is
very
bitter.
It
is
said
to
be
strong
strong
as
death!
Most
of
the
cheats
of
existence
are
strong.
As
to
their
sweetness,
nothing
is
so
transitory;
its
date
is
a
moment,
the
twinkling
of
an
eye.
The
sting
remains
for
ever.
It
may
perish
with
the
dawn
of
eternity,
but
it
tortures
through
time
into
its
deepest
night."
"Yes,
it
tortures
through
time,"
agreed
Caroline,
"except
when
it
is
mutual
love."
"Mutual
love!
My
dear,
romances
are
pernicious.
You
do
not
read
them,
I
hope?"
"Sometimes
whenever
I
can
get
them,
indeed.
But
romance
writers
might
know
nothing
of
love,
judging
by
the
way
in
which
they
treat
of
it."
"Nothing
whatever,
my
dear,"
assented
Mrs.
Pryor
eagerly,
"nor
of
marriage;
and
the
false
pictures
they
give
of
those
subjects
cannot
be
too
strongly
condemned.
They
are
not
like
reality.
They
show
you
only
the
green,
tempting
surface
of
the
marsh,
and
give
not
one
faithful
or
truthful
hint
of
the
slough
underneath."
"But
it
is
not
always
slough,"
objected
Caroline.
"There
are
happy
marriages.
Where
affection
is
reciprocal
and
sincere,
and
minds
are
harmonious,
marriage
must
be
happy."
"It
is
never
wholly
happy.
Two
people
can
never
literally
be
as
one.
There
is,
perhaps,
a
possibility
of
content
under
peculiar
circumstances,
such
as
are
seldom
combined;
but
it
is
as
well
not
to
run
the
risk
you
may
make
fatal
mistakes.
Be
satisfied,
my
dear.
Let
all
the
single
be
satisfied
with
their
freedom."
"You
echo
my
uncle's
words!"
exclaimed
Caroline,
in
a
tone
of
dismay.
"You
speak
like
Mrs.
Yorke
in
her
most
gloomy
moments,
like
Miss
Mann
when
she
is
most
sourly
and
hypochondriacally
disposed.
This
is
terrible!"
"No,
it
is
only
true.
O
child,
you
have
only
lived
the
pleasant
morning
time
of
life;
the
hot,
weary
noon,
the
sad
evening,
the
sunless
night,
are
yet
to
come
for
you.
Mr.
Helstone,
you
say,
talks
as
I
talk;
and
I
wonder
how
Mrs.
Matthewson
Helstone
would
have
talked
had
she
been
living.
She
died!
she
died!"
"And,
alas!
my
own
mother
and
father
"
exclaimed
Caroline,
struck
by
a
sombre
recollection.
"What
of
them?"
"Did
I
never
tell
you
that
they
were
separated?"
"I
have
heard
it."
"They
must,
then,
have
been
very
miserable."
"You
see
all
facts
go
to
prove
what
I
say."
"In
this
case
there
ought
to
be
no
such
thing
as
marriage."
"There
ought,
my
dear,
were
it
only
to
prove
that
this
life
is
a
mere
state
of
probation,
wherein
neither
rest
nor
recompense
is
to
be
vouchsafed."
"But
your
own
marriage,
Mrs.
Pryor?"
Mrs.
Pryor
shrank
and
shuddered
as
if
a
rude
finger
had
pressed
a
naked
nerve.
Caroline
felt
she
had
touched
what
would
not
bear
the
slightest
contact.
"My
marriage
was
unhappy,"
said
the
lady,
summoning
courage
at
last;
"but
yet
"
She
hesitated.
"But
yet,"
suggested
Caroline,
"not
immitigably
wretched?"
"Not
in
its
results,
at
least.
No,"
she
added,
in
a
softer
tone;
"God
mingles
something
of
the
balm
of
mercy
even
in
vials
of
the
most
corrosive
woe.
He
can
so
turn
events
that
from
the
very
same
blind,
rash
act
whence
sprang
the
curse
of
half
our
life
may
flow
the
blessing
of
the
remainder.
Then
I
am
of
a
peculiar
disposition
I
own
that
far
from
facile,
without
address,
in
some
points
eccentric.
I
ought
never
to
have
married.
Mine
is
not
the
nature
easily
to
find
a
duplicate
or
likely
to
assimilate
with
a
contrast.
I
was
quite
aware
of
my
own
ineligibility;
and
if
I
had
not
been
so
miserable
as
a
governess,
I
never
should
have
married;
and
then
"
Caroline's
eyes
asked
her
to
proceed.
They
entreated
her
to
break
the
thick
cloud
of
despair
which
her
previous
words
had
seemed
to
spread
over
life.
"And
then,
my
dear,
Mr.
that
is,
the
gentleman
I
married
was,
perhaps,
rather
an
exceptional
than
an
average
character.
I
hope,
at
least,
the
experience
of
few
has
been
such
as
mine
was,
or
that
few
have
felt
their
sufferings
as
I
felt
mine.
They
nearly
shook
my
mind;
relief
was
so
hopeless,
redress
so
unattainable.
But,
my
dear,
I
do
not
wish
to
dishearten;
I
only
wish
to
warn
you,
and
to
prove
that
the
single
should
not
be
too
anxious
to
change
their
state,
as
they
may
change
for
the
worse."
"Thank
you,
my
dear
madam.
I
quite
understand
your
kind
intentions,
but
there
is
no
fear
of
my
falling
into
the
error
to
which
you
allude.
I,
at
least,
have
no
thoughts
of
marriage,
and
for
that
reason
I
want
to
make
myself
a
position
by
some
other
means."
"My
dear,
listen
to
me.
On
what
I
am
going
to
say
I
have
carefully
deliberated,
having,
indeed,
revolved
the
subject
in
my
thoughts
ever
since
you
first
mentioned
your
wish
to
obtain
a
situation.
You
know
I
at
present
reside
with
Miss
Keeldar
in
the
capacity
of
companion.
Should
she
marry
(and
that
she
will
marry
ere
long
many
circumstances
induce
me
to
conclude),
I
shall
cease
to
be
necessary
to
her
in
that
capacity.
I
must
tell
you
that
I
possess
a
small
independency,
arising
partly
from
my
own
savings,
and
partly
from
a
legacy
left
me
some
years
since.
Whenever
I
leave
Fieldhead
I
shall
take
a
house
of
my
own.
I
could
not
endure
to
live
in
solitude.
I
have
no
relations
whom
I
care
to
invite
to
close
intimacy;
for,
as
you
must
have
observed,
and
as
I
have
already
avowed,
my
habits
and
tastes
have
their
peculiarities.
To
you,
my
dear,
I
need
not
say
I
am
attached;
with
you
I
am
happier
than
I
have
ever
been
with
any
living
thing"
(this
was
said
with
marked
emphasis).
"Your
society
I
should
esteem
a
very
dear
privilege
an
inestimable
privilege,
a
comfort,
a
blessing.
You
shall
come
to
me,
then.
Caroline,
do
you
refuse
me?
I
hope
you
can
love
me?"
And
with
these
two
abrupt
questions
she
stopped.
"Indeed,
I
do
love
you,"
was
the
reply.
"I
should
like
to
live
with
you.
But
you
are
too
kind."
"All
I
have,"
went
on
Mrs.
Pryor,
"I
would
leave
to
you.
You
should
be
provided
for.
But
never
again
say
I
am
too
kind.
You
pierce
my
heart,
child!"
"But,
my
dear
madam
this
generosity
I
have
no
claim
"
"Hush!
you
must
not
talk
about
it.
There
are
some
things
we
cannot
bear
to
hear.
Oh!
it
is
late
to
begin,
but
I
may
yet
live
a
few
years.
I
can
never
wipe
out
the
past,
but
perhaps
a
brief
space
in
the
future
may
yet
be
mine."
Mrs.
Pryor
seemed
deeply
agitated.
Large
tears
trembled
in
her
eyes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks.
Caroline
kissed
her,
in
her
gentle,
caressing
way,
saying
softly,
"I
love
you
dearly.
Don't
cry."
But
the
lady's
whole
frame
seemed
shaken.
She
sat
down,
bent
her
head
to
her
knee,
and
wept
aloud.
Nothing
could
console
her
till
the
inward
storm
had
had
its
way.
At
last
the
agony
subsided
of
itself.
"Poor
thing!"
she
murmured,
returning
Caroline's
kiss,
"poor
lonely
lamb!
But
come,"
she
added
abruptly
"come;
we
must
go
home."
For
a
short
distance
Mrs.
Pryor
walked
very
fast.
By
degrees,
however,
she
calmed
down
to
her
wonted
manner,
fell
into
her
usual
characteristic
pace
a
peculiar
one,
like
all
her
movements
and
by
the
time
they
reached
Fieldhead
she
had
re
entered
into
herself.
The
outside
was,
as
usual,
still
and
shy.
Only
half
of
Moore's
activity
and
resolution
had
been
seen
in
his
defence
of
the
mill;
he
showed
the
other
half
(and
a
terrible
half
it
was)
in
the
indefatigable,
the
relentless
assiduity
with
which
he
pursued
the
leaders
of
the
riot.
The
mob,
the
mere
followers,
he
let
alone.
Perhaps
an
innate
sense
of
justice
told
him
that
men
misled
by
false
counsel
and
goaded
by
privations
are
not
fit
objects
of
vengeance,
and
that
he
who
would
visit
an
even
violent
act
on
the
bent
head
of
suffering
is
a
tyrant,
not
a
judge.
At
all
events,
though
he
knew
many
of
the
number,
having
recognized
them
during
the
latter
part
of
the
attack
when
day
began
to
dawn,
he
let
them
daily
pass
him
on
street
and
road
without
notice
or
threat.
The
leaders
he
did
not
know.
They
were
strangers
emissaries
from
the
large
towns.
Most
of
these
were
not
members
of
the
operative
class.
They
were
chiefly
"down
draughts,"
bankrupts,
men
always
in
debt
and
often
in
drink,
men
who
had
nothing
to
lose,
and
much,
in
the
way
of
character,
cash,
and
cleanliness,
to
gain.
These
persons
Moore
hunted
like
any
sleuth
hound,
and
well
he
liked
the
occupation.
Its
excitement
was
of
a
kind
pleasant
to
his
nature.
He
liked
it
better
than
making
cloth.
His
horse
must
have
hated
these
times,
for
it
was
ridden
both
hard
and
often.
He
almost
lived
on
the
road,
and
the
fresh
air
was
as
welcome
to
his
lungs
as
the
policeman's
quest
to
his
mood;
he
preferred
it
to
the
steam
of
dye
houses.
The
magistrates
of
the
district
must
have
dreaded
him.
They
were
slow,
timid
men;
he
liked
both
to
frighten
and
to
rouse
them.
He
liked
to
force
them
to
betray
a
certain
fear,
which
made
them
alike
falter
in
resolve
and
recoil
in
action
the
fear,
simply,
of
assassination.
This,
indeed,
was
the
dread
which
had
hitherto
hampered
every
manufacturer
and
almost
every
public
man
in
the
district.
Helstone
alone
had
ever
repelled
it.
The
old
Cossack
knew
well
he
might
be
shot.
He
knew
there
was
risk;
but
such
death
had
for
his
nerves
no
terrors.
It
would
have
been
his
chosen,
might
he
have
had
a
choice.
Moore
likewise
knew
his
danger.
The
result
was
an
unquenchable
scorn
of
the
quarter
whence
such
danger
was
to
be
apprehended.
The
consciousness
that
he
hunted
assassins
was
the
spur
in
his
high
mettled
temper's
flank.
As
for
fear,
he
was
too
proud,
too
hard
natured
(if
you
will),
too
phlegmatic
a
man
to
fear.
Many
a
time
he
rode
belated
over
the
moors,
moonlit
or
moonless
as
the
case
might
be,
with
feelings
far
more
elate,
faculties
far
better
refreshed,
than
when
safety
and
stagnation
environed
him
in
the
counting
house.
Four
was
the
number
of
the
leaders
to
be
accounted
for.
Two,
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight,
were
brought
to
bay
near
Stilbro';
the
remaining
two
it
was
necessary
to
seek
farther
off.
Their
haunts
were
supposed
to
lie
near
Birmingham.
Meantime
the
clothier
did
not
neglect
his
battered
mill.
Its
reparation
was
esteemed
a
light
task,
carpenters'
and
glaziers'
work
alone
being
needed.
The
rioters
not
having
succeeded
in
effecting
an
entrance,
his
grim
metal
darlings
the
machines
had
escaped
damage.
Whether
during
this
busy
life
whether
while
stern
justice
and
exacting
business
claimed
his
energies
and
harassed
his
thoughts
he
now
and
then
gave
one
moment,
dedicated
one
effort,
to
keep
alive
gentler
fires
than
those
which
smoulder
in
the
fane
of
Nemesis,
it
was
not
easy
to
discover.
He
seldom
went
near
Fieldhead;
if
he
did,
his
visits
were
brief.
If
he
called
at
the
rectory,
it
was
only
to
hold
conferences
with
the
rector
in
his
study.
He
maintained
his
rigid
course
very
steadily.
Meantime
the
history
of
the
year
continued
troubled.
There
was
no
lull
in
the
tempest
of
war;
her
long
hurricane
still
swept
the
Continent.
There
was
not
the
faintest
sign
of
serene
weather,
no
opening
amid
"the
clouds
of
battle
dust
and
smoke,"
no
fall
of
pure
dews
genial
to
the
olive,
no
cessation
of
the
red
rain
which
nourishes
the
baleful
and
glorious
laurel.
Meantime,
Ruin
had
her
sappers
and
miners
at
work
under
Moore's
feet,
and
whether
he
rode
or
walked,
whether
he
only
crossed
his
counting
house
hearth
or
galloped
over
sullen
Rushedge,
he
was
aware
of
a
hollow
echo,
and
felt
the
ground
shake
to
his
tread.
While
the
summer
thus
passed
with
Moore,
how
did
it
lapse
with
Shirley
and
Caroline?
Let
us
first
visit
the
heiress.
How
does
she
look?
Like
a
love
lorn
maiden,
pale
and
pining
for
a
neglectful
swain?
Does
she
sit
the
day
long
bent
over
some
sedentary
task?
Has
she
for
ever
a
book
in
her
hand,
or
sewing
on
her
knee,
and
eyes
only
for
that,
and
words
for
nothing,
and
thoughts
unspoken?
By
no
means.
Shirley
is
all
right.
If
her
wistful
cast
of
physiognomy
is
not
gone,
no
more
is
her
careless
smile.
She
keeps
her
dark
old
manor
house
light
and
bright
with
her
cheery
presence.
The
gallery
and
the
low
ceiled
chambers
that
open
into
it
have
learned
lively
echoes
from
her
voice;
the
dim
entrance
hall,
with
its
one
window,
has
grown
pleasantly
accustomed
to
the
frequent
rustle
of
a
silk
dress,
as
its
wearer
sweeps
across
from
room
to
room,
now
carrying
flowers
to
the
barbarous
peach
bloom
salon,
now
entering
the
dining
room
to
open
its
casements
and
let
in
the
scent
of
mignonette
and
sweet
briar,
anon
bringing
plants
from
the
staircase
window
to
place
in
the
sun
at
the
open
porch
door.
She
takes
her
sewing
occasionally;
but,
by
some
fatality,
she
is
doomed
never
to
sit
steadily
at
it
for
above
five
minutes
at
a
time.
Her
thimble
is
scarcely
fitted
on,
her
needle
scarce
threaded,
when
a
sudden
thought
calls
her
upstairs.
Perhaps
she
goes
to
seek
some
just
then
remembered
old
ivory
backed
needle
book
or
older
china
topped
work
box,
quite
unneeded,
but
which
seems
at
the
moment
indispensable;
perhaps
to
arrange
her
hair,
or
a
drawer
which
she
recollects
to
have
seen
that
morning
in
a
state
of
curious
confusion;
perhaps
only
to
take
a
peep
from
a
particular
window
at
a
particular
view,
whence
Briarfield
church
and
rectory
are
visible,
pleasantly
bowered
in
trees.
She
has
scarcely
returned,
and
again
taken
up
the
slip
of
cambric
or
square
of
half
wrought
canvas,
when
Tartar's
bold
scrape
and
strangled
whistle
are
heard
at
the
porch
door,
and
she
must
run
to
open
it
for
him.
It
is
a
hot
day;
he
comes
in
panting;
she
must
convoy
him
to
the
kitchen,
and
see
with
her
own
eyes
that
his
water
bowl
is
replenished.
Through
the
open
kitchen
door
the
court
is
visible,
all
sunny
and
gay,
and
people
with
turkeys
and
their
poults,
peahens
and
their
chicks,
pearl
flecked
Guinea
fowls,
and
a
bright
variety
of
pure
white,
and
purple
necked,
and
blue
and
cinnamon
plumed
pigeons.
Irresistible
spectacle
to
Shirley!
She
runs
to
the
pantry
for
a
roll,
and
she
stands
on
the
door
step
scattering
crumbs.
Around
her
throng
her
eager,
plump,
happy
feathered
vassals
John
is
about
the
stables,
and
John
must
be
talked
to,
and
her
mare
looked
at.
She
is
still
petting
and
patting
it
when
the
cows
come
in
to
be
milked.
This
is
important;
Shirley
must
stay
and
take
a
review
of
them
all.
There
are
perhaps
some
little
calves,
some
little
new
yeaned
lambs
it
may
be
twins,
whose
mothers
have
rejected
them.
Miss
Keeldar
must
be
introduced
to
them
by
John,
must
permit
herself
the
treat
of
feeding
them
with
her
own
hand,
under
the
direction
of
her
careful
foreman.
Meantime
John
moots
doubtful
questions
about
the
farming
of
certain
"crofts,"
and
"ings,"
and
"holmes,"
and
his
mistress
is
necessitated
to
fetch
her
garden
hat
a
gipsy
straw
and
accompany
him,
over
stile
and
along
hedgerow,
to
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
agricultural
matter
on
the
spot,
and
with
the
said
"crofts,"
"ings,"
and
"holms"
under
her
eye.
Bright
afternoon
thus
wears
into
soft
evening,
and
she
comes
home
to
a
late
tea,
and
after
tea
she
never
sews.
After
tea
Shirley
reads,
and
she
is
just
about
as
tenacious
of
her
book
as
she
is
lax
of
her
needle.
Her
study
is
the
rug,
her
seat
a
footstool,
or
perhaps
only
the
carpet
at
Mrs.
Pryor's
feet:
there
she
always
learned
her
lessons
when
a
child,
and
old
habits
have
a
strong
power
over
her.
The
tawny
and
lionlike
bulk
of
Tartar
is
ever
stretched
beside
her,
his
negro
muzzle
laid
on
his
fore
paws
straight,
strong,
and
shapely
as
the
limbs
of
an
Alpine
wolf.
One
hand
of
the
mistress
generally
reposes
on
the
loving
serf's
rude
head,
because
if
she
takes
it
away
he
groans
and
is
discontented.
Shirley's
mind
is
given
to
her
book.
She
lifts
not
her
eyes;
she
neither
stirs
nor
speaks
unless,
indeed,
it
be
to
return
a
brief
respectful
answer
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
addresses
deprecatory
phrases
to
her
now
and
then.
"My
dear,
you
had
better
not
have
that
great
dog
so
near
you;
he
is
crushing
the
border
of
your
dress."
"Oh,
it
is
only
muslin.
I
can
put
a
clean
one
on
to
morrow."
"My
dear,
I
wish
you
could
acquire
the
habit
of
sitting
to
a
table
when
you
read."
"I
will
try,
ma'am,
some
time;
but
it
is
so
comfortable
to
do
as
one
has
always
been
accustomed
to
do."
"My
dear,
let
me
beg
of
you
to
put
that
book
down.
You
are
trying
your
eyes
by
the
doubtful
firelight."
"No,
ma'am,
not
at
all;
my
eyes
are
never
tired."
At
last,
however,
a
pale
light
falls
on
the
page
from
the
window.
She
looks;
the
moon
is
up.
She
closes
the
volume,
rises,
and
walks
through
the
room.
Her
book
has
perhaps
been
a
good
one;
it
has
refreshed,
refilled,
rewarmed
her
heart;
it
has
set
her
brain
astir,
furnished
her
mind
with
pictures.
The
still
parlour,
the
clean
hearth,
the
window
opening
on
the
twilight
sky,
and
showing
its
"sweet
regent,"
new
throned
and
glorious,
suffice
to
make
earth
an
Eden,
life
a
poem,
for
Shirley.
A
still,
deep,
inborn
delight
glows
in
her
young
veins,
unmingled,
untroubled,
not
to
be
reached
or
ravished
by
human
agency,
because
by
no
human
agency
bestowed
the
pure
gift
of
God
to
His
creature,
the
free
dower
of
Nature
to
her
child.
This
joy
gives
her
experience
of
a
genii
life.
Buoyant,
by
green
steps,
by
glad
hills,
all
verdure
and
light,
she
reaches
a
station
scarcely
lower
than
that
whence
angels
looked
down
on
the
dreamer
of
Bethel,
and
her
eye
seeks,
and
her
soul
possesses,
the
vision
of
life
as
she
wishes
it.
No,
not
as
she
wishes
it;
she
has
not
time
to
wish.
The
swift
glory
spreads
out,
sweeping
and
kindling,
and
multiplies
its
splendours
faster
than
Thought
can
effect
his
combinations,
faster
than
Aspiration
can
utter
her
longings.
Shirley
says
nothing
while
the
trance
is
upon
her
she
is
quite
mute;
but
if
Mrs.
Pryor
speaks
to
her
now,
she
goes
out
quietly,
and
continues
her
walk
upstairs
in
the
dim
gallery.
If
Shirley
were
not
an
indolent,
a
reckless,
an
ignorant
being,
she
would
take
a
pen
at
such
moments,
or
at
least
while
the
recollection
of
such
moments
was
yet
fresh
on
her
spirit.
She
would
seize,
she
would
fix
the
apparition,
tell
the
vision
revealed.
Had
she
a
little
more
of
the
organ
of
acquisitiveness
in
her
head,
a
little
more
of
the
love
of
property
in
her
nature,
she
would
take
a
good
sized
sheet
of
paper
and
write
plainly
out,
in
her
own
queer
but
clear
and
legible
hand,
the
story
that
has
been
narrated,
the
song
that
has
been
sung
to
her,
and
thus
possess
what
she
was
enabled
to
create.
But
indolent
she
is,
reckless
she
is,
and
most
ignorant;
for
she
does
not
know
her
dreams
are
rare,
her
feelings
peculiar.
She
does
not
know,
has
never
known,
and
will
die
without
knowing,
the
full
value
of
that
spring
whose
bright
fresh
bubbling
in
her
heart
keeps
it
green.
Shirley
takes
life
easily.
Is
not
that
fact
written
in
her
eye?
In
her
good
tempered
moments
is
it
not
as
full
of
lazy
softness
as
in
her
brief
fits
of
anger
it
is
fulgent
with
quick
flashing
fire?
Her
nature
is
in
her
eye.
So
long
as
she
is
calm,
indolence,
indulgence,
humour,
and
tenderness
possess
that
large
gray
sphere;
incense
her,
a
red
ray
pierces
the
dew,
it
quickens
instantly
to
flame.
Ere
the
month
of
July
was
past,
Miss
Keeldar
would
probably
have
started
with
Caroline
on
that
northern
tour
they
had
planned;
but
just
at
that
epoch
an
invasion
befell
Fieldhead.
A
genteel
foraging
party
besieged
Shirley
in
her
castle,
and
compelled
her
to
surrender
at
discretion.
An
uncle,
an
aunt,
and
two
cousins
from
the
south
a
Mr.,
Mrs.,
and
two
Misses
Sympson,
of
Sympson
Grove,
shire
came
down
upon
her
in
state.
The
laws
of
hospitality
obliged
her
to
give
in,
which
she
did
with
a
facility
which
somewhat
surprised
Caroline,
who
knew
her
to
be
prompt
in
action
and
fertile
in
expedient
where
a
victory
was
to
be
gained
for
her
will.
Miss
Helstone
even
asked
her
how
it
was
she
submitted
so
readily.
She
answered,
old
feelings
had
their
power;
she
had
passed
two
years
of
her
early
youth
at
Sympson
Grove.
"How
did
she
like
her
relatives?"
She
had
nothing
in
common
with
them,
she
replied.
Little
Harry
Sympson,
indeed,
the
sole
son
of
the
family,
was
very
unlike
his
sisters,
and
of
him
she
had
formerly
been
fond;
but
he
was
not
coming
to
Yorkshire
at
least
not
yet.
The
next
Sunday
the
Fieldhead
pew
in
Briarfield
Church
appeared
peopled
with
a
prim,
trim,
fidgety,
elderly
gentleman,
who
shifted
his
spectacles,
and
changed
his
position
every
three
minutes;
a
patient,
placid
looking
elderly
lady
in
brown
satin;
and
two
pattern
young
ladies,
in
pattern
attire,
with
pattern
deportment.
Shirley
had
the
air
of
a
black
swan
or
a
white
crow
in
the
midst
of
this
party,
and
very
forlorn
was
her
aspect.
Having
brought
her
into
respectable
society,
we
will
leave
her
there
a
while,
and
look
after
Miss
Helstone.
Separated
from
Miss
Keeldar
for
the
present,
as
she
could
not
seek
her
in
the
midst
of
her
fine
relatives,
scared
away
from
Fieldhead
by
the
visiting
commotion
which
the
new
arrivals
occasioned
in
the
neighbourhood,
Caroline
was
limited
once
more
to
the
gray
rectory,
the
solitary
morning
walk
in
remote
by
paths,
the
long,
lonely
afternoon
sitting
in
a
quiet
parlour
which
the
sun
forsook
at
noon,
or
in
the
garden
alcove
where
it
shone
bright,
yet
sad,
on
the
ripening
red
currants
trained
over
the
trellis,
and
on
the
fair
monthly
roses
entwined
between,
and
through
them
fell
chequered
on
Caroline
sitting
in
her
white
summer
dress,
still
as
a
garden
statue.
There
she
read
old
books,
taken
from
her
uncle's
library.
The
Greek
and
Latin
were
of
no
use
to
her,
and
its
collection
of
light
literature
was
chiefly
contained
on
a
shelf
which
had
belonged
to
her
aunt
Mary
some
venerable
Lady's
Magazines,
that
had
once
performed
a
sea
voyage
with
their
owner,
and
undergone
a
storm,
and
whose
pages
were
stained
with
salt
water;
some
mad
Methodist
Magazines,
full
of
miracles
and
apparitions,
of
preternatural
warnings,
ominous
dreams,
and
frenzied
fanaticism;
the
equally
mad
letters
of
Mrs.
Elizabeth
Rowe
from
the
Dead
to
the
Living;
a
few
old
English
classics.
From
these
faded
flowers
Caroline
had
in
her
childhood
extracted
the
honey;
they
were
tasteless
to
her
now.
By
way
of
change,
and
also
of
doing
good,
she
would
sew
make
garments
for
the
poor,
according
to
good
Miss
Ainley's
direction.
Sometimes,
as
she
felt
and
saw
her
tears
fall
slowly
on
her
work,
she
would
wonder
how
the
excellent
woman
who
had
cut
it
out
and
arranged
it
for
her
managed
to
be
so
equably
serene
in
her
solitude.
"I
never
find
Miss
Ainley
oppressed
with
despondency
or
lost
in
grief,"
she
thought;
"yet
her
cottage
is
a
still,
dim
little
place,
and
she
is
without
a
bright
hope
or
near
friend
in
the
world.
I
remember,
though,
she
told
me
once
she
had
tutored
her
thoughts
to
tend
upwards
to
heaven.
She
allowed
there
was,
and
ever
had
been,
little
enjoyment
in
this
world
for
her,
and
she
looks,
I
suppose,
to
the
bliss
of
the
world
to
come.
So
do
nuns,
with
their
close
cell,
their
iron
lamp,
their
robe
strait
as
a
shroud,
their
bed
narrow
as
a
coffin.
She
says
often
she
has
no
fear
of
death
no
dread
of
the
grave;
no
more,
doubtless,
had
St.
Simeon
Stylites,
lifted
up
terrible
on
his
wild
column
in
the
wilderness;
no
more
has
the
Hindu
votary
stretched
on
his
couch
of
iron
spikes.
Both
these
having
violated
nature,
their
natural
likings
and
antipathies
are
reversed;
they
grow
altogether
morbid.
I
do
fear
death
as
yet,
but
I
believe
it
is
because
I
am
young.
Poor
Miss
Ainley
would
cling
closer
to
life
if
life
had
more
charms
for
her.
God
surely
did
not
create
us
and
cause
us
to
live
with
the
sole
end
of
wishing
always
to
die.
I
believe
in
my
heart
we
were
intended
to
prize
life
and
enjoy
it
so
long
as
we
retain
it.
Existence
never
was
originally
meant
to
be
that
useless,
blank,
pale,
slow
trailing
thing
it
often
becomes
to
many,
and
is
becoming
to
me
among
the
rest.
"Nobody,"
she
went
on
"nobody
in
particular
is
to
blame,
that
I
can
see,
for
the
state
in
which
things
are;
and
I
cannot
tell,
however
much
I
puzzle
over
it,
how
they
are
to
be
altered
for
the
better;
but
I
feel
there
is
something
wrong
somewhere.
I
believe
single
women
should
have
more
to
do
better
chances
of
interesting
and
profitable
occupation
than
they
possess
now.
And
when
I
speak
thus
I
have
no
impression
that
I
displease
God
by
my
words;
that
I
am
either
impious
or
impatient,
irreligious
or
sacrilegious.
My
consolation
is,
indeed,
that
God
hears
many
a
groan,
and
compassionates
much
grief
which
man
stops
his
ears
against,
or
frowns
on
with
impotent
contempt.
I
say
impotent,
for
I
observe
that
to
such
grievances
as
society
cannot
readily
cure
it
usually
forbids
utterance,
on
pain
of
its
scorn,
this
scorn
being
only
a
sort
of
tinselled
cloak
to
its
deformed
weakness.
People
hate
to
be
reminded
of
ills
they
are
unable
or
unwilling
to
remedy.
Such
reminder,
in
forcing
on
them
a
sense
of
their
own
incapacity,
or
a
more
painful
sense
of
an
obligation
to
make
some
unpleasant
effort,
troubles
their
ease
and
shakes
their
self
complacency.
Old
maids,
like
the
houseless
and
unemployed
poor,
should
not
ask
for
a
place
and
an
occupation
in
the
world;
the
demand
disturbs
the
happy
and
rich
it
disturbs
parents.
Look
at
the
numerous
families
of
girls
in
this
neighbourhood
the
Armitages,
the
Birtwhistles,
the
Sykeses.
The
brothers
of
these
girls
are
every
one
in
business
or
in
professions;
they
have
something
to
do.
Their
sisters
have
no
earthly
employment
but
household
work
and
sewing,
no
earthly
pleasure
but
an
unprofitable
visiting,
and
no
hope,
in
all
their
life
to
come,
of
anything
better.
This
stagnant
state
of
things
makes
them
decline
in
health.
They
are
never
well,
and
their
minds
and
views
shrink
to
wondrous
narrowness.
The
great
wish,
the
sole
aim
of
every
one
of
them
is
to
be
married,
but
the
majority
will
never
marry;
they
will
die
as
they
now
live.
They
scheme,
they
plot,
they
dress
to
ensnare
husbands.
The
gentlemen
turn
them
into
ridicule;
they
don't
want
them;
they
hold
them
very
cheap.
They
say
I
have
heard
them
say
it
with
sneering
laughs
many
a
time
the
matrimonial
market
is
overstocked.
Fathers
say
so
likewise,
and
are
angry
with
their
daughters
when
they
observe
their
maneauvres
they
order
them
to
stay
at
home.
What
do
they
expect
them
to
do
at
home?
If
you
ask,
they
would
answer,
sew
and
cook.
They
expect
them
to
do
this,
and
this
only,
contentedly,
regularly,
uncomplainingly,
all
their
lives
long,
as
if
they
had
no
germs
of
faculties
for
anything
else
a
doctrine
as
reasonable
to
hold
as
it
would
be
that
the
fathers
have
no
faculties
but
for
eating
what
their
daughters
cook
or
for
wearing
what
they
sew.
Could
men
live
so
themselves?
Would
they
not
be
very
weary?
And
when
there
came
no
relief
to
their
weariness,
but
only
reproaches
at
its
slightest
manifestation,
would
not
their
weariness
ferment
it
time
to
frenzy?
Lucretia,
spinning
at
midnight
in
the
midst
of
her
maidens,
and
Solomon's
virtuous
woman
are
often
quoted
as
patterns
of
what
'the
sex,'
as
they
say,
ought
to
be.
I
don't
know.
Lucretia,
I
dare
say,
was
a
most
worthy
sort
of
person,
much
like
my
cousin
Hortense
Moore;
but
she
kept
her
servants
up
very
late.
I
should
not
have
liked
to
be
amongst
the
number
of
the
maidens.
Hortense
would
just
work
me
and
Sarah
in
that
fashion,
if
she
could,
and
neither
of
us
would
bear
it.
The
'virtuous
woman,'
again,
had
her
household
up
in
the
very
middle
of
the
night;
she
'got
breakfast
over,'
as
Mrs.
Sykes
says,
before
one
o'clock
a.m.;
but
she
had
something
more
to
do
than
spin
and
give
out
portions.
She
was
a
manufacturer
she
made
fine
linen
and
sold
it;
she
was
an
agriculturist
she
bought
estates
and
planted
vineyards.
That
woman
was
a
manager.
She
was
what
the
matrons
hereabouts
call
'a
clever
woman.'
On
the
whole,
I
like
her
a
good
deal
better
than
Lucretia;
but
I
don't
believe
either
Mr.
Armitage
or
Mr.
Sykes
could
have
got
the
advantage
of
her
in
a
bargain.
Yet
I
like
her.
'Strength
and
honour
were
her
clothing;
the
heart
of
her
husband
safely
trusted
in
her.
She
opened
her
mouth
with
wisdom;
in
her
tongue
was
the
law
of
kindness;
her
children
rose
up
and
called
her
blessed;
her
husband
also
praised
her.'
King
of
Israel!
your
model
of
a
woman
is
a
worthy
model!
But
are
we,
in
these
days,
brought
up
to
be
like
her?
Men
of
Yorkshire!
do
your
daughters
reach
this
royal
standard?
Can
they
reach
it?
Can
you
help
them
to
reach
it?
Can
you
give
them
a
field
in
which
their
faculties
may
be
exercised
and
grow?
Men
of
England!
look
at
your
poor
girls,
many
of
them
fading
around
you,
dropping
off
in
consumption
or
decline;
or,
what
is
worse,
degenerating
to
sour
old
maids
envious,
back
biting,
wretched,
because
life
is
a
desert
to
them;
or,
what
is
worst
of
all,
reduced
to
strive,
by
scarce
modest
coquetry
and
debasing
artifice,
to
gain
that
position
and
consideration
by
marriage
which
to
celibacy
is
denied.
Fathers!
cannot
you
alter
these
things?
Perhaps
not
all
at
once;
but
consider
the
matter
well
when
it
is
brought
before
you,
receive
it
as
a
theme
worthy
of
thought;
do
not
dismiss
it
with
an
idle
jest
or
an
unmanly
insult.
You
would
wish
to
be
proud
of
your
daughters,
and
not
to
blush
for
them;
then
seek
for
them
an
interest
and
an
occupation
which
shall
raise
them
above
the
flirt,
the
maneauvrer,
the
mischief
making
tale
bearer.
Keep
your
girls'
minds
narrow
and
fettered;
they
will
still
be
a
plague
and
a
care,
sometimes
a
disgrace
to
you.
Cultivate
them
give
them
scope
and
work;
they
will
be
your
gayest
companions
in
health,
your
tenderest
nurses
in
sickness,
your
most
faithful
prop
in
age."
One
fine
summer
day
that
Caroline
had
spent
entirely
alone
(her
uncle
being
at
Whinbury),
and
whose
long,
bright,
noiseless,
breezeless,
cloudless
hours
(how
many
they
seemed
since
sunrise!)
had
been
to
her
as
desolate
as
if
they
had
gone
over
her
head
in
the
shadowless
and
trackless
wastes
of
Sahara,
instead
of
in
the
blooming
garden
of
an
English
home,
she
was
sitting
in
the
alcove
her
task
of
work
on
her
knee,
her
fingers
assiduously
plying
the
needle,
her
eyes
following
and
regulating
their
movements,
her
brain
working
restlessly
when
Fanny
came
to
the
door,
looked
round
over
the
lawn
and
borders,
and
not
seeing
her
whom
she
sought,
called
out,
"Miss
Caroline!"
A
low
voice
answered
"Fanny!"
It
issued
from
the
alcove,
and
thither
Fanny
hastened,
a
note
in
her
hand,
which
she
delivered
to
fingers
that
hardly
seemed
to
have
nerve
to
hold
it.
Miss
Helstone
did
not
ask
whence
it
came,
and
she
did
not
look
at
it;
she
let
it
drop
amongst
the
folds
of
her
work.
"Joe
Scott's
son,
Harry,
brought
it,"
said
Fanny.
The
girl
was
no
enchantress,
and
knew
no
magic
spell;
yet
what
she
said
took
almost
magical
effect
on
her
young
mistress.
She
lifted
her
head
with
the
quick
motion
of
revived
sensation;
she
shot,
not
a
languid,
but
a
lifelike,
questioning
glance
at
Fanny.
"Harry
Scott!
who
sent
him?"
"He
came
from
the
Hollow."
The
dropped
note
was
snatched
up
eagerly,
the
seal
was
broken
it
was
read
in
two
seconds.
An
affectionate
billet
from
Hortense,
informing
her
young
cousin
that
she
was
returned
from
Wormwood
Wells;
that
she
was
alone
to
day,
as
Robert
was
gone
to
Whinbury
market;
that
nothing
would
give
her
greater
pleasure
than
to
have
Caroline's
company
to
tea,
and
the
good
lady
added,
she
was
quite
sure
such
a
change
would
be
most
acceptable
and
beneficial
to
Caroline,
who
must
be
sadly
at
a
loss
both
for
safe
guidance
and
improving
society
since
the
misunderstanding
between
Robert
and
Mr.
Helstone
had
occasioned
a
separation
from
her
"meilleure
amie,
Hortense
Gerard
Moore."
In
a
postscript
she
was
urged
to
put
on
her
bonnet
and
run
down
directly.
Caroline
did
not
need
the
injunction.
Glad
was
she
to
lay
by
the
brown
holland
child's
slip
she
was
trimming
with
braid
for
the
Jew's
basket,
to
hasten
upstairs,
cover
her
curls
with
her
straw
bonnet,
and
throw
round
her
shoulders
the
black
silk
scarf,
whose
simple
drapery
suited
as
well
her
shape
as
its
dark
hue
set
off
the
purity
of
her
dress
and
the
fairness
of
her
face;
glad
was
she
to
escape
for
a
few
hours
the
solitude,
the
sadness,
the
nightmare
of
her
life;
glad
to
run
down
the
green
lane
sloping
to
the
Hollow,
to
scent
the
fragrance
of
hedge
flowers
sweeter
than
the
perfume
of
moss
rose
or
lily.
True,
she
knew
Robert
was
not
at
the
cottage;
but
it
was
delight
to
go
where
he
had
lately
been.
So
long,
so
totally
separated
from
him,
merely
to
see
his
home,
to
enter
the
room
where
he
had
that
morning
sat,
felt
like
a
reunion.
As
such
it
revived
her;
and
then
Illusion
was
again
following
her
in
Peri
mask.
The
soft
agitation
of
wings
caressed
her
cheek,
and
the
air,
breathing
from
the
blue
summer
sky,
bore
a
voice
which
whispered,
"Robert
may
come
home
while
you
are
in
his
house,
and
then,
at
least,
you
may
look
in
his
face
at
least
you
may
give
him
your
hand;
perhaps,
for
a
minute,
you
may
sit
beside
him."
"Silence!"
was
her
austere
response;
but
she
loved
the
comforter
and
the
consolation.
Miss
Moore
probably
caught
from
the
window
the
gleam
and
flutter
of
Caroline's
white
attire
through
the
branchy
garden
shrubs,
for
she
advanced
from
the
cottage
porch
to
meet
her.
Straight,
unbending,
phlegmatic
as
usual,
she
came
on.
No
haste
or
ecstasy
was
ever
permitted
to
disorder
the
dignity
of
her
movements;
but
she
smiled,
well
pleased
to
mark
the
delight
of
her
pupil,
to
feel
her
kiss
and
the
gentle,
genial
strain
of
her
embrace.
She
led
her
tenderly
in,
half
deceived
and
wholly
flattered.
Half
deceived!
had
it
not
been
so
she
would
in
all
probability
have
put
her
to
the
wicket,
and
shut
her
out.
Had
she
known
clearly
to
whose
account
the
chief
share
of
this
childlike
joy
was
to
be
placed,
Hortense
would
most
likely
have
felt
both
shocked
and
incensed.
Sisters
do
not
like
young
ladies
to
fall
in
love
with
their
brothers.
It
seems,
if
not
presumptuous,
silly,
weak,
a
delusion,
an
absurd
mistake.
They
do
not
love
these
gentlemen
whatever
sisterly
affection
they
may
cherish
towards
them
and
that
others
should,
repels
them
with
a
sense
of
crude
romance.
The
first
movement,
in
short,
excited
by
such
discovery
(as
with
many
parents
on
finding
their
children
to
be
in
love)
is
one
of
mixed
impatience
and
contempt.
Reason
if
they
be
rational
people
corrects
the
false
feeling
in
time;
but
if
they
be
irrational,
it
is
never
corrected,
and
the
daughter
or
sister
in
law
is
disliked
to
the
end.
"You
would
expect
to
find
me
alone,
from
what
I
said
in
my
note,"
observed
Miss
Moore,
as
she
conducted
Caroline
towards
the
parlour;
"but
it
was
written
this
morning:
since
dinner,
company
has
come
in."
And
opening
the
door
she
made
visible
an
ample
spread
of
crimson
skirts
overflowing
the
elbow
chair
at
the
fireside,
and
above
them,
presiding
with
dignity,
a
cap
more
awful
than
a
crown.
That
cap
had
never
come
to
the
cottage
under
a
bonnet;
no,
it
had
been
brought
in
a
vast
bag,
or
rather
a
middle
sized
balloon
of
black
silk,
held
wide
with
whalebone.
The
screed,
or
frill
of
the
cap,
stood
a
quarter
of
a
yard
broad
round
the
face
of
the
wearer.
The
ribbon,
flourishing
in
puffs
and
bows
about
the
head,
was
of
the
sort
called
love
ribbon.
There
was
a
good
deal
of
it,
I
may
say,
a
very
great
deal.
Mrs.
Yorke
wore
the
cap
it
became
her;
she
wore
the
gown
also
it
suited
her
no
less.
That
great
lady
was
come
in
a
friendly
way
to
take
tea
with
Miss
Moore.
It
was
almost
as
great
and
as
rare
a
favour
as
if
the
queen
were
to
go
uninvited
to
share
pot
luck
with
one
of
her
subjects.
A
higher
mark
of
distinction
she
could
not
show
she
who
in
general
scorned
visiting
and
tea
drinking,
and
held
cheap
and
stigmatized
as
"gossips"
every
maid
and
matron
of
the
vicinage.
There
was
no
mistake,
however;
Miss
Moore
was
a
favourite
with
her.
She
had
evinced
the
fact
more
than
once
evinced
it
by
stopping
to
speak
to
her
in
the
churchyard
on
Sundays;
by
inviting
her,
almost
hospitably,
to
come
to
Briarmains;
evinced
it
to
day
by
the
grand
condescension
of
a
personal
visit.
Her
reasons
for
the
preference,
as
assigned
by
herself,
were
that
Miss
Moore
was
a
woman
of
steady
deportment,
without
the
least
levity
of
conversation
or
carriage;
also
that,
being
a
foreigner,
she
must
feel
the
want
of
a
friend
to
countenance
her.
She
might
have
added
that
her
plain
aspect,
homely,
precise
dress,
and
phlegmatic,
unattractive
manner
were
to
her
so
many
additional
recommendations.
It
is
certain,
at
least,
that
ladies
remarkable
for
the
opposite
qualities
of
beauty,
lively
bearing,
and
elegant
taste
in
attire
were
not
often
favoured
with
her
approbation.
Whatever
gentlemen
are
apt
to
admire
in
women,
Mrs.
Yorke
condemned;
and
what
they
overlook
or
despise,
she
patronized.
Caroline
advanced
to
the
mighty
matron
with
some
sense
of
diffidence.
She
knew
little
of
Mrs.
Yorke,
and,
as
a
parson's
niece,
was
doubtful
what
sort
of
a
reception
she
might
get.
She
got
a
very
cool
one,
and
was
glad
to
hide
her
discomfiture
by
turning
away
to
take
off
her
bonnet.
Nor,
upon
sitting
down,
was
she
displeased
to
be
immediately
accosted
by
a
little
personage
in
a
blue
frock
and
sash,
who
started
up
like
some
fairy
from
the
side
of
the
great
dame's
chair,
where
she
had
been
sitting
on
a
footstool,
screened
from
view
by
the
folds
of
the
wide
red
gown,
and
running
to
Miss
Helstone,
unceremoniously
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
demanded
a
kiss.
"My
mother
is
not
civil
to
you,"
said
the
petitioner,
as
she
received
and
repaid
a
smiling
salute,
"and
Rose
there
takes
no
notice
of
you;
it
is
their
way.
If,
instead
of
you,
a
white
angel,
with
a
crown
of
stars,
had
come
into
the
room,
mother
would
nod
stiffly,
and
Rose
never
lift
her
head
at
all;
but
I
will
be
your
friend
I
have
always
liked
you."
"Jessie,
curb
that
tongue
of
yours,
and
repress
your
forwardness!"
said
Mrs.
Yorke.
"But,
mother,
you
are
so
frozen!"
expostulated
Jessie.
"Miss
Helstone
has
never
done
you
any
harm;
why
can't
you
be
kind
to
her?
You
sit
so
stiff,
and
look
so
cold,
and
speak
so
dry
what
for?
That's
just
the
fashion
in
which
you
treat
Miss
Shirley
Keeldar
and
every
other
young
lady
who
comes
to
our
house.
And
Rose
there
is
such
an
aut
aut
I
have
forgotten
the
word,
but
it
means
a
machine
in
the
shape
of
a
human
being.
However,
between
you,
you
will
drive
every
soul
away
from
Briarmains;
Martin
often
says
so."
"I
am
an
automaton?
Good!
Let
me
alone,
then,"
said
Rose,
speaking
from
a
corner
where
she
was
sitting
on
the
carpet
at
the
foot
of
a
bookcase,
with
a
volume
spread
open
on
her
knee.
"Miss
Helstone,
how
do
you
do?"
she
added,
directing
a
brief
glance
to
the
person
addressed,
and
then
again
casting
down
her
gray,
remarkable
eyes
on
the
book
and
returning
to
the
study
of
its
pages.
Caroline
stole
a
quiet
gaze
towards
her,
dwelling
on
her
young,
absorbed
countenance,
and
observing
a
certain
unconscious
movement
of
the
mouth
as
she
read
a
movement
full
of
character.
Caroline
had
tact,
and
she
had
fine
instinct.
She
felt
that
Rose
Yorke
was
a
peculiar
child
one
of
the
unique;
she
knew
how
to
treat
her.
Approaching
quietly,
she
knelt
on
the
carpet
at
her
side,
and
looked
over
her
little
shoulder
at
her
book.
It
was
a
romance
of
Mrs.
Radcliffe's
"The
Italian."
Caroline
read
on
with
her,
making
no
remark.
Presently
Rose
showed
her
the
attention
of
asking,
ere
she
turned
the
leaf,
"Are
you
ready?"
Caroline
only
nodded.
"Do
you
like
it?"
inquired
Rose
ere
long.
"Long
since,
when
I
read
it
as
a
child,
I
was
wonderfully
taken
with
it."
"Why?"
"It
seemed
to
open
with
such
promise
such
foreboding
of
a
most
strange
tale
to
be
unfolded."
"And
in
reading
it
you
feel
as
if
you
were
far
away
from
England
really
in
Italy
under
another
sort
of
sky
that
blue
sky
of
the
south
which
travellers
describe."
"You
are
sensible
of
that,
Rose?"
"It
makes
me
long
to
travel,
Miss
Helstone."
"When
you
are
a
woman,
perhaps,
you
may
be
able
to
gratify
your
wish."
"I
mean
to
make
a
way
to
do
so,
if
one
is
not
made
for
me.
I
cannot
live
always
in
Briarfield.
The
whole
world
is
not
very
large
compared
with
creation.
I
must
see
the
outside
of
our
own
round
planet,
at
least."
"How
much
of
its
outside?"
"First
this
hemisphere
where
we
live;
then
the
other.
I
am
resolved
that
my
life
shall
be
a
life.
Not
a
black
trance
like
the
toad's,
buried
in
marble;
nor
a
long,
slow
death
like
yours
in
Briarfield
rectory."
"Like
mine!
what
can
you
mean,
child?"
"Might
you
not
as
well
be
tediously
dying
as
for
ever
shut
up
in
that
glebe
house
a
place
that,
when
I
pass
it,
always
reminds
me
of
a
windowed
grave?
I
never
see
any
movement
about
the
door.
I
never
hear
a
sound
from
the
wall.
I
believe
smoke
never
issues
from
the
chimneys.
What
do
you
do
there?"
"I
sew,
I
read,
I
learn
lessons."
"Are
you
happy?"
"Should
I
be
happy
wandering
alone
in
strange
countries
as
you
wish
to
do?"
"Much
happier,
even
if
you
did
nothing
but
wander.
Remember,
however,
that
I
shall
have
an
object
in
view;
but
if
you
only
went
on
and
on,
like
some
enchanted
lady
in
a
fairy
tale,
you
might
be
happier
than
now.
In
a
day's
wandering
you
would
pass
many
a
hill,
wood,
and
watercourse,
each
perpetually
altering
in
aspect
as
the
sun
shone
out
or
was
overcast;
as
the
weather
was
wet
or
fair,
dark
or
bright.
Nothing
changes
in
Briarfield
rectory.
The
plaster
of
the
parlour
ceilings,
the
paper
on
the
walls,
the
curtains,
carpets,
chairs,
are
still
the
same."
"Is
change
necessary
to
happiness?"
"Yes."
"Is
it
synonymous
with
it?"
"I
don't
know;
but
I
feel
monotony
and
death
to
be
almost
the
same."
Here
Jessie
spoke.
"Isn't
she
mad?"
she
asked.
"But,
Rose,"
pursued
Caroline,
"I
fear
a
wanderer's
life,
for
me
at
least,
would
end
like
that
tale
you
are
reading
in
disappointment,
vanity,
and
vexation
of
spirit."
"Does
'The
Italian'
so
end?"
"I
thought
so
when
I
read
it."
"Better
to
try
all
things
and
find
all
empty
than
to
try
nothing
and
leave
your
life
a
blank.
To
do
this
is
to
commit
the
sin
of
him
who
buried
his
talent
in
a
napkin
despicable
sluggard!"
"Rose,"
observed
Mrs.
Yorke,
"solid
satisfaction
is
only
to
be
realized
by
doing
one's
duty."
"Right,
mother!
And
if
my
Master
has
given
me
ten
talents,
my
duty
is
to
trade
with
them,
and
make
them
ten
talents
more.
Not
in
the
dust
of
household
drawers
shall
the
coin
be
interred.
I
will
not
deposit
it
in
a
broken
spouted
teapot,
and
shut
it
up
in
a
china
closet
among
tea
things.
I
will
not
commit
it
to
your
work
table
to
be
smothered
in
piles
of
woollen
hose.
I
will
not
prison
it
in
the
linen
press
to
find
shrouds
among
the
sheets.
And
least
of
all,
mother"
(she
got
up
from
the
floor)
"least
of
all
will
I
hide
it
in
a
tureen
of
cold
potatoes,
to
be
ranged
with
bread,
butter,
pastry,
and
ham
on
the
shelves
of
the
larder."
She
stopped,
then
went
on,
"Mother,
the
Lord
who
gave
each
of
us
our
talents
will
come
home
some
day,
and
will
demand
from
all
an
account.
The
teapot,
the
old
stocking
foot,
the
linen
rag,
the
willow
pattern
tureen
will
yield
up
their
barren
deposit
in
many
a
house.
Suffer
your
daughters,
at
least,
to
put
their
money
to
the
exchangers,
that
they
may
be
enabled
at
the
Master's
coming
to
pay
Him
His
own
with
usury."
"Rose,
did
you
bring
your
sampler
with
you,
as
I
told
you?"
"Yes,
mother."
"Sit
down,
and
do
a
line
of
marking."
Rose
sat
down
promptly,
and
wrought
according
to
orders.
After
a
busy
pause
of
ten
minutes,
her
mother
asked,
"Do
you
think
yourself
oppressed
now
a
victim?"
"No,
mother."
"Yet,
as
far
as
I
understood
your
tirade,
it
was
a
protest
against
all
womanly
and
domestic
employment."
"You
misunderstood
it,
mother.
I
should
be
sorry
not
to
learn
to
sew.
You
do
right
to
teach
me,
and
to
make
me
work."
"Even
to
the
mending
of
your
brothers'
stockings
and
the
making
of
sheets?"
"Yes."
"Where
is
the
use
of
ranting
and
spouting
about
it,
then?"
"Am
I
to
do
nothing
but
that?
I
will
do
that,
and
then
I
will
do
more.
Now,
mother,
I
have
said
my
say.
I
am
twelve
years
old
at
present,
and
not
till
I
am
sixteen
will
I
speak
again
about
talents.
For
four
years
I
bind
myself
an
industrious
apprentice
to
all
you
can
teach
me."
"You
see
what
my
daughters
are,
Miss
Helstone,"
observed
Mrs.
Yorke;
"how
precociously
wise
in
their
own
conceits!
'I
would
rather
this,
I
prefer
that'
such
is
Jessie's
cuckoo
song;
while
Rose
utters
the
bolder
cry,
'I
will,
and
I
will
not!'"
"I
render
a
reason,
mother;
besides,
if
my
cry
is
bold,
it
is
only
heard
once
in
a
twelvemonth.
About
each
birthday
the
spirit
moves
me
to
deliver
one
oracle
respecting
my
own
instruction
and
management.
I
utter
it
and
leave
it;
it
is
for
you,
mother,
to
listen
or
not."
"I
would
advise
all
young
ladies,"
pursued
Mrs.
Yorke,
"to
study
the
characters
of
such
children
as
they
chance
to
meet
with
before
they
marry
and
have
any
of
their
own
to
consider
well
how
they
would
like
the
responsibility
of
guiding
the
careless,
the
labour
of
persuading
the
stubborn,
the
constant
burden
and
task
of
training
the
best."
"But
with
love
it
need
not
be
so
very
difficult,"
interposed
Caroline.
"Mothers
love
their
children
most
dearly
almost
better
than
they
love
themselves."
"Fine
talk!
very
sentimental!
There
is
the
rough,
practical
part
of
life
yet
to
come
for
you,
young
miss."
"But,
Mrs.
Yorke,
if
I
take
a
little
baby
into
my
arms
any
poor
woman's
infant,
for
instance
I
feel
that
I
love
that
helpless
thing
quite
peculiarly,
though
I
am
not
its
mother.
I
could
do
almost
anything
for
it
willingly,
if
it
were
delivered
over
entirely
to
my
care
if
it
were
quite
dependent
on
me."
"You
feel!
Yes,
yes!
I
dare
say,
now.
You
are
led
a
great
deal
by
your
feelings,
and
you
think
yourself
a
very
sensitive
personage,
no
doubt.
Are
you
aware
that,
with
all
these
romantic
ideas,
you
have
managed
to
train
your
features
into
an
habitually
lackadaisical
expression,
better
suited
to
a
novel
heroine
than
to
a
woman
who
is
to
make
her
way
in
the
real
world
by
dint
of
common
sense?"
"No;
I
am
not
at
all
aware
of
that,
Mrs.
Yorke."
"Look
in
the
glass
just
behind
you.
Compare
the
face
you
see
there
with
that
of
any
early
rising,
hard
working
milkmaid."
"My
face
is
a
pale
one,
but
it
is
not
sentimental;
and
most
milkmaids,
however
red
and
robust
they
may
be,
are
more
stupid
and
less
practically
fitted
to
make
their
way
in
the
world
than
I
am.
I
think
more,
and
more
correctly,
than
milkmaids
in
general
do;
consequently,
where
they
would
often,
for
want
of
reflection,
act
weakly,
I,
by
dint
of
reflection,
should
act
judiciously."
"Oh
no!
you
would
be
influenced
by
your
feelings;
you
would
be
guided
by
impulse."
"Of
course
I
should
often
be
influenced
by
my
feelings.
They
were
given
me
to
that
end.
Whom
my
feelings
teach
me
to
love
I
must
and
shall
love;
and
I
hope,
if
ever
I
have
a
husband
and
children,
my
feelings
will
induce
me
to
love
them.
I
hope,
in
that
case,
all
my
impulses
will
be
strong
in
compelling
me
to
love."
Caroline
had
a
pleasure
in
saying
this
with
emphasis;
she
had
a
pleasure
in
daring
to
say
it
in
Mrs.
Yorke's
presence.
She
did
not
care
what
unjust
sarcasm
might
be
hurled
at
her
in
reply.
She
flushed,
not
with
anger
but
excitement,
when
the
ungenial
matron
answered
coolly,
"Don't
waste
your
dramatic
effects.
That
was
well
said
it
was
quite
fine;
but
it
is
lost
on
two
women
an
old
wife
and
an
old
maid.
There
should
have
been
a
disengaged
gentleman
present.
Is
Mr.
Robert
nowhere
hid
behind
the
curtains,
do
you
think,
Miss
Moore?"
Hortense,
who
during
the
chief
part
of
the
conversation
had
been
in
the
kitchen
superintending
the
preparations
for
tea,
did
not
yet
quite
comprehend
the
drift
of
the
discourse.
She
answered,
with
a
puzzled
air,
that
Robert
was
at
Whinbury.
Mrs.
Yorke
laughed
her
own
peculiar
short
laugh.
"Straightforward
Miss
Moore!"
said
she
patronizingly.
"It
is
like
you
to
understand
my
question
so
literally
and
answer
it
so
simply.
Your
mind
comprehends
nothing
of
intrigue.
Strange
things
might
go
on
around
you
without
your
being
the
wiser;
you
are
not
of
the
class
the
world
calls
sharp
witted."
These
equivocal
compliments
did
not
seem
to
please
Hortense.
She
drew
herself
up,
puckered
her
black
eyebrows,
but
still
looked
puzzled.
"I
have
ever
been
noted
for
sagacity
and
discernment
from
childhood,"
she
returned;
for,
indeed,
on
the
possession
of
these
qualities
she
peculiarly
piqued
herself.
"You
never
plotted
to
win
a
husband,
I'll
be
bound,"
pursued
Mrs.
Yorke;
"and
you
have
not
the
benefit
of
previous
experience
to
aid
you
in
discovering
when
others
plot."
Caroline
felt
this
kind
language
where
the
benevolent
speaker
intended
she
should
feel
it
in
her
very
heart.
She
could
not
even
parry
the
shafts;
she
was
defenceless
for
the
present.
To
answer
would
have
been
to
avow
that
the
cap
fitted.
Mrs.
Yorke,
looking
at
her
as
she
sat
with
troubled,
downcast
eyes,
and
cheek
burning
painfully,
and
figure
expressing
in
its
bent
attitude
and
unconscious
tremor
all
the
humiliation
and
chagrin
she
experienced,
felt
the
sufferer
was
fair
game.
The
strange
woman
had
a
natural
antipathy
to
a
shrinking,
sensitive
character
a
nervous
temperament;
nor
was
a
pretty,
delicate,
and
youthful
face
a
passport
to
her
affections.
It
was
seldom
she
met
with
all
these
obnoxious
qualities
combined
in
one
individual;
still
more
seldom
she
found
that
individual
at
her
mercy,
under
circumstances
in
which
she
could
crush
her
well.
She
happened
this
afternoon
to
be
specially
bilious
and
morose
as
much
disposed
to
gore
as
any
vicious
"mother
of
the
herd."
Lowering
her
large
head
she
made
a
new
charge.
"Your
cousin
Hortense
is
an
excellent
sister,
Miss
Helstone.
Such
ladies
as
come
to
try
their
life's
luck
here
at
Hollow's
Cottage
may,
by
a
very
little
clever
female
artifice,
cajole
the
mistress
of
the
house,
and
have
the
game
all
in
their
own
hands.
You
are
fond
of
your
cousin's
society,
I
dare
say,
miss?"
"Of
which
cousin's?"
"Oh,
of
the
lady's,
of
course."
"Hortense
is,
and
always
has
been,
most
kind
to
me."
"Every
sister
with
an
eligible
single
brother
is
considered
most
kind
by
her
spinster
friends."
"Mrs.
Yorke,"
said
Caroline,
lifting
her
eyes
slowly,
their
blue
orbs
at
the
same
time
clearing
from
trouble,
and
shining
steady
and
full,
while
the
glow
of
shame
left
her
cheek,
and
its
hue
turned
pale
and
settled
"Mrs.
Yorke,
may
I
ask
what
you
mean?"
"To
give
you
a
lesson
on
the
cultivation
of
rectitude,
to
disgust
you
with
craft
and
false
sentiment."
"Do
I
need
this
lesson?"
"Most
young
ladies
of
the
present
day
need
it.
You
are
quite
a
modern
young
lady
morbid,
delicate,
professing
to
like
retirement;
which
implies,
I
suppose,
that
you
find
little
worthy
of
your
sympathies
in
the
ordinary
world.
The
ordinary
world
every
day
honest
folks
are
better
than
you
think
them,
much
better
than
any
bookish,
romancing
chit
of
a
girl
can
be
who
hardly
ever
puts
her
nose
over
her
uncle
the
parson's
garden
wall."
"Consequently
of
whom
you
know
nothing.
Excuse
me
indeed,
it
does
not
matter
whether
you
excuse
me
or
not
you
have
attacked
me
without
provocation;
I
shall
defend
myself
without
apology.
Of
my
relations
with
my
two
cousins
you
are
ignorant.
In
a
fit
of
ill
humour
you
have
attempted
to
poison
them
by
gratuitous
insinuations,
which
are
far
more
crafty
and
false
than
anything
with
which
you
can
justly
charge
me.
That
I
happen
to
be
pale,
and
sometimes
to
look
diffident,
is
no
business
of
yours;
that
I
am
fond
of
books,
and
indisposed
for
common
gossip,
is
still
less
your
business;
that
I
am
a
'romancing
chit
of
a
girl'
is
a
mere
conjecture
on
your
part.
I
never
romanced
to
you
nor
to
anybody
you
know.
That
I
am
the
parson's
niece
is
not
a
crime,
though
you
may
be
narrow
minded
enough
to
think
it
so.
You
dislike
me.
You
have
no
just
reason
for
disliking
me;
therefore
keep
the
expression
of
your
aversion
to
yourself.
If
at
any
time
in
future
you
evince
it
annoyingly,
I
shall
answer
even
less
scrupulously
than
I
have
done
now."
She
ceased,
and
sat
in
white
and
still
excitement.
She
had
spoken
in
the
clearest
of
tones,
neither
fast
nor
loud;
but
her
silver
accents
thrilled
the
ear.
The
speed
of
the
current
in
her
veins
was
just
then
as
swift
as
it
was
viewless.
Mrs.
Yorke
was
not
irritated
at
the
reproof,
worded
with
a
severity
so
simple,
dictated
by
a
pride
so
quiet.
Turning
coolly
to
Miss
Moore,
she
said,
nodding
her
cap
approvingly,
"She
has
spirit
in
her,
after
all.
Always
speak
as
honestly
as
you
have
done
just
now,"
she
continued,
"and
you'll
do."
"I
repel
a
recommendation
so
offensive,"
was
the
answer,
delivered
in
the
same
pure
key,
with
the
same
clear
look.
"I
reject
counsel
poisoned
by
insinuation.
It
is
my
right
to
speak
as
I
think
proper;
nothing
binds
me
to
converse
as
you
dictate.
So
far
from
always
speaking
as
I
have
done
just
now,
I
shall
never
address
any
one
in
a
tone
so
stern
or
in
language
so
harsh,
unless
in
answer
to
unprovoked
insult."
"Mother,
you
have
found
your
match,"
pronounced
little
Jessie,
whom
the
scene
appeared
greatly
to
edify.
Rose
had
heard
the
whole
with
an
unmoved
face.
She
now
said,
"No;
Miss
Helstone
is
not
my
mother's
match,
for
she
allows
herself
to
be
vexed.
My
mother
would
wear
her
out
in
a
few
weeks.
Shirley
Keeldar
manages
better.
Mother,
you
have
never
hurt
Miss
Keeldar's
feelings
yet.
She
wears
armour
under
her
silk
dress
that
you
cannot
penetrate."
Mrs.
Yorke
often
complained
that
her
children
were
mutinous.
It
was
strange
that
with
all
her
strictness,
with
all
her
"strong
mindedness,"
she
could
gain
no
command
over
them.
A
look
from
their
father
had
more
influence
with
them
than
a
lecture
from
her.
Miss
Moore
to
whom
the
position
of
witness
to
an
altercation
in
which
she
took
no
part
was
highly
displeasing,
as
being
an
unimportant
secondary
post
now
rallying
her
dignity,
prepared
to
utter
a
discourse
which
was
to
prove
both
parties
in
the
wrong,
and
to
make
it
clear
to
each
disputant
that
she
had
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
herself,
and
ought
to
submit
humbly
to
the
superior
sense
of
the
individual
then
addressing
her.
Fortunately
for
her
audience,
she
had
not
harangued
above
ten
minutes
when
Sarah's
entrance
with
the
tea
tray
called
her
attention,
first
to
the
fact
of
that
damsel
having
a
gilt
comb
in
her
hair
and
a
red
necklace
round
her
throat,
and
secondly,
and
subsequently
to
a
pointed
remonstrance,
to
the
duty
of
making
tea.
After
the
meal
Rose
restored
her
to
good
humour
by
bringing
her
guitar
and
asking
for
a
song,
and
afterwards
engaging
her
in
an
intelligent
and
sharp
cross
examination
about
guitar
playing
and
music
in
general.
Jessie,
meantime,
directed
her
assiduities
to
Caroline.
Sitting
on
a
stool
at
her
feet,
she
talked
to
her,
first
about
religion
and
then
about
politics.
Jessie
was
accustomed
at
home
to
drink
in
a
great
deal
of
what
her
father
said
on
these
subjects,
and
afterwards
in
company
to
retail,
with
more
wit
and
fluency
than
consistency
or
discretion,
his
opinions,
antipathies,
and
preferences.
She
rated
Caroline
soundly
for
being
a
member
of
the
Established
Church,
and
for
having
an
uncle
a
clergyman.
She
informed
her
that
she
lived
on
the
country,
and
ought
to
work
for
her
living
honestly,
instead
of
passing
a
useless
life,
and
eating
the
bread
of
idleness
in
the
shape
of
tithes.
Thence
Jessie
passed
to
a
review
of
the
ministry
at
that
time
in
office,
and
a
consideration
of
its
deserts.
She
made
familiar
mention
of
the
names
of
Lord
Castlereagh
and
Mr.
Perceval.
Each
of
these
personages
she
adorned
with
a
character
that
might
have
separately
suited
Moloch
and
Belial.
She
denounced
the
war
as
wholesale
murder,
and
Lord
Wellington
as
a
"hired
butcher."
Her
auditress
listened
with
exceeding
edification.
Jessie
had
something
of
the
genius
of
humour
in
her
nature.
It
was
inexpressibly
comic
to
hear
her
repeating
her
sire's
denunciations
in
his
nervous
northern
Doric;
as
hearty
a
little
Jacobin
as
ever
pent
a
free
mutinous
spirit
in
a
muslin
frock
and
sash.
Not
malignant
by
nature,
her
language
was
not
so
bitter
as
it
was
racy,
and
the
expressive
little
face
gave
a
piquancy
to
every
phrase
which
held
a
beholder's
interest
captive.
Caroline
chid
her
when
she
abused
Lord
Wellington;
but
she
listened
delighted
to
a
subsequent
tirade
against
the
Prince
Regent.
Jessie
quickly
read,
in
the
sparkle
of
her
hearer's
eye
and
the
laughter
hovering
round
her
lips,
that
at
last
she
had
hit
on
a
topic
that
pleased.
Many
a
time
had
she
heard
the
fat
"Adonis
of
fifty"
discussed
at
her
father's
breakfast
table,
and
she
now
gave
Mr.
Yorke's
comments
on
the
theme
genuine
as
uttered
by
his
Yorkshire
lips.
But,
Jessie,
I
will
write
about
you
no
more.
This
is
an
autumn
evening,
wet
and
wild.
There
is
only
one
cloud
in
the
sky,
but
it
curtains
it
from
pole
to
pole.
The
wind
cannot
rest;
it
hurries
sobbing
over
hills
of
sullen
outline,
colourless
with
twilight
and
mist.
Rain
has
beat
all
day
on
that
church
tower.
It
rises
dark
from
the
stony
enclosure
of
its
graveyard.
The
nettles,
the
long
grass,
and
the
tombs
all
drip
with
wet.
This
evening
reminds
me
too
forcibly
of
another
evening
some
years
ago
a
howling,
rainy
autumn
evening
too
when
certain
who
had
that
day
performed
a
pilgrimage
to
a
grave
new
made
in
a
heretic
cemetery
sat
near
a
wood
fire
on
the
hearth
of
a
foreign
dwelling.
They
were
merry
and
social,
but
they
each
knew
that
a
gap,
never
to
be
filled,
had
been
made
in
their
circle.
They
knew
they
had
lost
something
whose
absence
could
never
be
quite
atoned
for
so
long
as
they
lived;
and
they
knew
that
heavy
falling
rain
was
soaking
into
the
wet
earth
which
covered
their
lost
darling,
and
that
the
sad,
sighing
gale
was
mourning
above
her
buried
head.
The
fire
warmed
them;
life
and
friendship
yet
blessed
them;
but
Jessie
lay
cold,
coffined,
solitary
only
the
sod
screening
her
from
the
storm.
Mrs.
Yorke
folded
up
her
knitting,
cut
short
the
music
lesson
and
the
lecture
on
politics,
and
concluded
her
visit
to
the
cottage,
at
an
hour
early
enough
to
ensure
her
return
to
Briarmains
before
the
blush
of
sunset
should
quite
have
faded
in
heaven,
or
the
path
up
the
fields
have
become
thoroughly
moist
with
evening
dew.
The
lady
and
her
daughters
being
gone,
Caroline
felt
that
she
also
ought
to
resume
her
scarf,
kiss
her
cousin's
cheek,
and
trip
away
homeward.
If
she
lingered
much
later
dusk
would
draw
on,
and
Fanny
would
be
put
to
the
trouble
of
coming
to
fetch
her.
It
was
both
baking
and
ironing
day
at
the
rectory,
she
remembered
Fanny
would
be
busy.
Still,
she
could
not
quit
her
seat
at
the
little
parlour
window.
From
no
point
of
view
could
the
west
look
so
lovely
as
from
that
lattice
with
the
garland
of
jessamine
round
it,
whose
white
stars
and
green
leaves
seemed
now
but
gray
pencil
outlines
graceful
in
form,
but
colourless
in
tint
against
the
gold
incarnadined
of
a
summer
evening
against
the
fire
tinged
blue
of
an
August
sky
at
eight
o'clock
p.m.
Caroline
looked
at
the
wicket
gate,
beside
which
holly
oaks
spired
up
tall.
She
looked
at
the
close
hedge
of
privet
and
laurel
fencing
in
the
garden;
her
eyes
longed
to
see
something
more
than
the
shrubs
before
they
turned
from
that
limited
prospect.
They
longed
to
see
a
human
figure,
of
a
certain
mould
and
height,
pass
the
hedge
and
enter
the
gate.
A
human
figure
she
at
last
saw
nay,
two.
Frederick
Murgatroyd
went
by,
carrying
a
pail
of
water;
Joe
Scott
followed,
dangling
on
his
forefinger
the
keys
of
the
mill.
They
were
going
to
lock
up
mill
and
stables
for
the
night,
and
then
betake
themselves
home.
"So
must
I,"
thought
Caroline,
as
she
half
rose
and
sighed.
"This
is
all
folly
heart
breaking
folly,"
she
added.
"In
the
first
place,
though
I
should
stay
till
dark
there
will
be
no
arrival;
because
I
feel
in
my
heart,
Fate
has
written
it
down
in
to
day's
page
of
her
eternal
book,
that
I
am
not
to
have
the
pleasure
I
long
for.
In
the
second
place,
if
he
stepped
in
this
moment,
my
presence
here
would
be
a
chagrin
to
him,
and
the
consciousness
that
it
must
be
so
would
turn
half
my
blood
to
ice.
His
hand
would,
perhaps,
be
loose
and
chill
if
I
put
mine
into
it;
his
eye
would
be
clouded
if
I
sought
its
beam.
I
should
look
up
for
that
kindling,
something
I
have
seen
in
past
days,
when
my
face,
or
my
language,
or
my
disposition
had
at
some
happy
moment
pleased
him;
I
should
discover
only
darkness.
I
had
better
go
home."
She
took
her
bonnet
from
the
table
where
it
lay,
and
was
just
fastening
the
ribbon,
when
Hortense,
directing
her
attention
to
a
splendid
bouquet
of
flowers
in
a
glass
on
the
same
table,
mentioned
that
Miss
Keeldar
had
sent
them
that
morning
from
Fieldhead;
and
went
on
to
comment
on
the
guests
that
lady
was
at
present
entertaining,
on
the
bustling
life
she
had
lately
been
leading;
adding
divers
conjectures
that
she
did
not
very
well
like
it,
and
much
wonderment
that
a
person
who
was
so
fond
of
her
own
way
as
the
heiress
did
not
find
some
means
of
sooner
getting
rid
of
this
cortege
of
relatives.
"But
they
say
she
actually
will
not
let
Mr.
Sympson
and
his
family
go,"
she
added.
"They
wanted
much
to
return
to
the
south
last
week,
to
be
ready
for
the
reception
of
the
only
son,
who
is
expected
home
from
a
tour.
She
insists
that
her
cousin
Henry
shall
come
and
join
his
friends
here
in
Yorkshire.
I
dare
say
she
partly
does
it
to
oblige
Robert
and
myself."
"How
to
oblige
Robert
and
you?"
inquired
Caroline.
"Why,
my
child,
you
are
dull.
Don't
you
know
you
must
often
have
heard
"
"Please,
ma'am,"
said
Sarah,
opening
the
door,
"the
preserves
that
you
told
me
to
boil
in
treacle
the
congfiters,
as
you
call
them
is
all
burnt
to
the
pan."
"Les
confitures!
Elles
sont
brulees?
Ah,
quelle
negligence
coupable!
Coquine
de
cuisiniere,
fille
insupportable!"
And
mademoiselle,
hastily
taking
from
a
drawer
a
large
linen
apron,
and
tying
it
over
her
black
apron,
rushed
eperdue
into
the
kitchen,
whence,
to
speak
truth,
exhaled
an
odour
of
calcined
sweets
rather
strong
than
savoury.
The
mistress
and
maid
had
been
in
full
feud
the
whole
day,
on
the
subject
of
preserving
certain
black
cherries,
hard
as
marbles,
sour
as
sloes.
Sarah
held
that
sugar
was
the
only
orthodox
condiment
to
be
used
in
that
process;
mademoiselle
maintained
and
proved
it
by
the
practice
and
experience
of
her
mother,
grandmother,
and
great
grandmother
that
treacle,
"melasse,"
was
infinitely
preferable.
She
had
committed
an
imprudence
in
leaving
Sarah
in
charge
of
the
preserving
pan,
for
her
want
of
sympathy
in
the
nature
of
its
contents
had
induced
a
degree
of
carelessness
in
watching
their
confection,
whereof
the
result
was
dark
and
cindery
ruin.
Hubbub
followed;
high
upbraiding,
and
sobs
rather
loud
than
deep
or
real.
Caroline,
once
more
turning
to
the
little
mirror,
was
shading
her
ringlets
from
her
cheek
to
smooth
them
under
her
cottage
bonnet,
certain
that
it
would
not
only
be
useless
but
unpleasant
to
stay
longer,
when,
on
the
sudden
opening
of
the
back
door,
there
fell
an
abrupt
calm
in
the
kitchen.
The
tongues
were
checked,
pulled
up
as
with
bit
and
bridle.
"Was
it
was
it
Robert?"
He
often
almost
always
entered
by
the
kitchen
way
on
his
return
from
market.
No;
it
was
only
Joe
Scott,
who,
having
hemmed
significantly
thrice
every
hem
being
meant
as
a
lofty
rebuke
to
the
squabbling
womankind
said,
"Now,
I
thowt
I
heerd
a
crack?"
None
answered.
"And,"
he
continued
pragmatically,
"as
t'
maister's
comed,
and
as
he'll
enter
through
this
hoyle,
I
considered
it
desirable
to
step
in
and
let
ye
know.
A
household
o'
women
is
nivver
fit
to
be
comed
on
wi'out
warning.
Here
he
is.
Walk
forrard,
sir.
They
war
playing
up
queerly,
but
I
think
I've
quietened
'em."
Another
person,
it
was
now
audible,
entered.
Joe
Scott
proceeded
with
his
rebukes.
"What
d'ye
mean
by
being
all
i'
darkness?
Sarah,
thou
quean,
canst
t'
not
light
a
candle?
It
war
sundown
an
hour
syne.
He'll
brak
his
shins
agean
some
o'
yer
pots,
and
tables,
and
stuff.
Tak
tent
o'
this
baking
bowl,
sir;
they've
set
it
i'
yer
way,
fair
as
if
they
did
it
i'
malice."
To
Joe's
observations
succeeded
a
confused
sort
of
pause,
which
Caroline,
though
she
was
listening
with
both
her
ears,
could
not
understand.
It
was
very
brief.
A
cry
broke
it
a
sound
of
surprise,
followed
by
the
sound
of
a
kiss;
ejaculations,
but
half
articulate,
succeeded.
"Mon
Dieu!
mon
Dieu!
Est
ce
que
je
m'y
attendais?"
were
the
words
chiefly
to
be
distinguished.
"Et
tu
te
portes
toujours
bien,
bonne
seaur?"
inquired
another
voice
Robert's,
certainly.
Caroline
was
puzzled.
Obeying
an
impulse
the
wisdom
of
which
she
had
not
time
to
question,
she
escaped
from
the
little
parlour,
by
way
of
leaving
the
coast
clear,
and
running
upstairs
took
up
a
position
at
the
head
of
the
banisters,
whence
she
could
make
further
observations
ere
presenting
herself.
It
was
considerably
past
sunset
now;
dusk
filled
the
passage,
yet
not
such
deep
dusk
but
that
she
could
presently
see
Robert
and
Hortense
traverse
it.
"Caroline!
Caroline!"
called
Hortense,
a
moment
afterwards,
"venez
voir
mon
frere!"
"Strange,"
commented
Miss
Helstone,
"passing
strange!
What
does
this
unwonted
excitement
about
such
an
every
day
occurrence
as
a
return
from
market
portend?
She
has
not
lost
her
senses,
has
she?
Surely
the
burnt
treacle
has
not
crazed
her?"
She
descended
in
a
subdued
flutter.
Yet
more
was
she
fluttered
when
Hortense
seized
her
hand
at
the
parlour
door,
and
leading
her
to
Robert,
who
stood
in
bodily
presence,
tall
and
dark
against
the
one
window,
presented
her
with
a
mixture
of
agitation
and
formality,
as
though
they
had
been
utter
strangers,
and
this
was
their
first
mutual
introduction.
Increasing
puzzle!
He
bowed
rather
awkwardly,
and
turning
from
her
with
a
stranger's
embarrassment,
he
met
the
doubtful
light
from
the
window.
It
fell
on
his
face,
and
the
enigma
of
the
dream
(a
dream
it
seemed)
was
at
its
height.
She
saw
a
visage
like
and
unlike
Robert,
and
no
Robert.
"What
is
the
matter?"
said
Caroline.
"Is
my
sight
wrong?
Is
it
my
cousin?"
"Certainly
it
is
your
cousin,"
asserted
Hortense.
Then
who
was
this
now
coming
through
the
passage
now
entering
the
room?
Caroline,
looking
round,
met
a
new
Robert
the
real
Robert,
as
she
felt
at
once.
"Well,"
said
he,
smiling
at
her
questioning,
astonished
face,
"which
is
which?"
"Ah,
this
is
you!"
was
the
answer.
He
laughed.
"I
believe
it
is
me.
And
do
you
know
who
he
is?
You
never
saw
him
before,
but
you
have
heard
of
him."
She
had
gathered
her
senses
now.
"It
can
be
only
one
person
your
brother,
since
it
is
so
like
you;
my
other
cousin,
Louis."
"Clever
little
eadipus!
you
would
have
baffled
the
Sphinx!
But
now,
see
us
together.
Change
places;
change
again,
to
confuse
her,
Louis.
Which
is
the
old
love
now,
Lina?"
"As
if
it
were
possible
to
make
a
mistake
when
you
speak!
You
should
have
told
Hortense
to
ask.
But
you
are
not
so
much
alike.
It
is
only
your
height,
your
figure,
and
complexion
that
are
so
similar."
"And
I
am
Robert,
am
I
not?"
asked
the
newcomer,
making
a
first
effort
to
overcome
what
seemed
his
natural
shyness.
Caroline
shook
her
head
gently.
A
soft,
expressive
ray
from
her
eye
beamed
on
the
real
Robert.
It
said
much.
She
was
not
permitted
to
quit
her
cousins
soon.
Robert
himself
was
peremptory
in
obliging
her
to
remain.
Glad,
simple,
and
affable
in
her
demeanour
(glad
for
this
night,
at
least),
in
light,
bright
spirits
for
the
time,
she
was
too
pleasant
an
addition
to
the
cottage
circle
to
be
willingly
parted
with
by
any
of
them.
Louis
seemed
naturally
rather
a
grave,
still,
retiring
man;
but
the
Caroline
of
this
evening,
which
was
not
(as
you
know,
reader)
the
Caroline
of
every
day,
thawed
his
reserve,
and
cheered
his
gravity
soon.
He
sat
near
her
and
talked
to
her.
She
already
knew
his
vocation
was
that
of
tuition.
She
learned
now
he
had
for
some
years
been
the
tutor
of
Mr.
Sympson's
son;
that
he
had
been
travelling
with
him,
and
had
accompanied
him
to
the
north.
She
inquired
if
he
liked
his
post,
but
got
a
look
in
reply
which
did
not
invite
or
license
further
question.
The
look
woke
Caroline's
ready
sympathy.
She
thought
it
a
very
sad
expression
to
pass
over
so
sensible
a
face
as
Louis's;
for
he
had
a
sensible
face,
though
not
handsome,
she
considered,
when
seen
near
Robert's.
She
turned
to
make
the
comparison.
Robert
was
leaning
against
the
wall,
a
little
behind
her,
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
book
of
engravings,
and
probably
listening,
at
the
same
time,
to
the
dialogue
between
her
and
Louis.
"How
could
I
think
them
alike?"
she
asked
herself.
"I
see
now
it
is
Hortense
Louis
resembles,
not
Robert."
And
this
was
in
part
true.
He
had
the
shorter
nose
and
longer
upper
lip
of
his
sister
rather
than
the
fine
traits
of
his
brother.
He
had
her
mould
of
mouth
and
chin
all
less
decisive,
accurate,
and
clear
than
those
of
the
young
mill
owner.
His
air,
though
deliberate
and
reflective,
could
scarcely
be
called
prompt
and
acute.
You
felt,
in
sitting
near
and
looking
up
at
him,
that
a
slower
and
probably
a
more
benignant
nature
than
that
of
the
elder
Moore
shed
calm
on
your
impressions.
Robert
perhaps
aware
that
Caroline's
glance
had
wandered
towards
and
dwelt
upon
him,
though
he
had
neither
met
nor
answered
it
put
down
the
book
of
engravings,
and
approaching,
took
a
seat
at
her
side.
She
resumed
her
conversation
with
Louis,
but
while
she
talked
to
him
her
thoughts
were
elsewhere.
Her
heart
beat
on
the
side
from
which
her
face
was
half
averted.
She
acknowledged
a
steady,
manly,
kindly
air
in
Louis;
but
she
bent
before
the
secret
power
of
Robert.
To
be
so
near
him
though
he
was
silent,
though
he
did
not
touch
so
much
as
her
scarf
fringe
or
the
white
hem
of
her
dress
affected
her
like
a
spell.
Had
she
been
obliged
to
speak
to
him
only,
it
would
have
quelled,
but,
at
liberty
to
address
another,
it
excited
her.
Her
discourse
flowed
freely;
it
was
gay,
playful,
eloquent.
The
indulgent
look
and
placid
manner
of
her
auditor
encouraged
her
to
ease;
the
sober
pleasure
expressed
by
his
smile
drew
out
all
that
was
brilliant
in
her
nature.
She
felt
that
this
evening
she
appeared
to
advantage,
and
as
Robert
was
a
spectator,
the
consciousness
contented
her.
Had
he
been
called
away,
collapse
would
at
once
have
succeeded
stimulus.
But
her
enjoyment
was
not
long
to
shine
full
orbed;
a
cloud
soon
crossed
it.
Hortense,
who
for
some
time
had
been
on
the
move
ordering
supper,
and
was
now
clearing
the
little
table
of
some
books,
etc.,
to
make
room
for
the
tray,
called
Robert's
attention
to
the
glass
of
flowers,
the
carmine
and
snow
and
gold
of
whose
petals
looked
radiant
indeed
by
candlelight.
"They
came
from
Fieldhead,"
she
said,
"intended
as
a
gift
to
you,
no
doubt.
We
know
who
is
the
favourite
there;
not
I,
I'm
sure."
It
was
a
wonder
to
hear
Hortense
jest
a
sign
that
her
spirits
were
at
high
water
mark
indeed.
"We
are
to
understand,
then,
that
Robert
is
the
favourite?"
observed
Louis.
"Mon
cher,"
replied
Hortense,
"Robert
c'est
tout
ce
qu'il
y
a
de
plus
precieux
au
monde;
a
cote
de
lui
le
reste
du
genre
humain
n'est
que
du
rebut.
N'ai
je
pas
raison,
mon
enfant?"
she
added,
appealing
to
Caroline.
Caroline
was
obliged
to
reply,
"Yes,"
and
her
beacon
was
quenched.
Her
star
withdrew
as
she
spoke.
"Et
toi,
Robert?"
inquired
Louis.
"When
you
shall
have
an
opportunity,
ask
herself,"
was
the
quiet
answer.
Whether
he
reddened
or
paled
Caroline
did
not
examine.
She
discovered
that
it
was
late,
and
she
must
go
home.
Home
she
would
go;
not
even
Robert
could
detain
her
now.
The
future
sometimes
seems
to
sob
a
low
warning
of
the
events
it
is
bringing
us,
like
some
gathering
though
yet
remote
storm,
which,
in
tones
of
the
wind,
in
flushings
of
the
firmament,
in
clouds
strangely
torn,
announces
a
blast
strong
to
strew
the
sea
with
wrecks;
or
commissioned
to
bring
in
fog
the
yellow
taint
of
pestilence
covering
white
Western
isles
with
the
poisoned
exhalations
of
the
East,
dimming
the
lattices
of
English
homes
with
the
breath
of
Indian
plague.
At
other
times
this
future
bursts
suddenly,
as
if
a
rock
had
rent,
and
in
it
a
grave
had
opened,
whence
issues
the
body
of
one
that
slept.
Ere
you
are
aware
you
stand
face
to
face
with
a
shrouded
and
unthought
of
calamity
a
new
Lazarus.
Caroline
Helstone
went
home
from
Hollow's
Cottage
in
good
health,
as
she
imagined.
On
waking
the
next
morning
she
felt
oppressed
with
unwonted
languor.
At
breakfast,
at
each
meal
of
the
following
day,
she
missed
all
sense
of
appetite.
Palatable
food
was
as
ashes
and
sawdust
to
her.
"Am
I
ill?"
she
asked,
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass.
Her
eyes
were
bright,
their
pupils
dilated,
her
cheeks
seemed
rosier,
and
fuller
than
usual.
"I
look
well;
why
can
I
not
eat?"
She
felt
a
pulse
beat
fast
in
her
temples;
she
felt,
too,
her
brain
in
strange
activity.
Her
spirits
were
raised;
hundreds
of
busy
and
broken
but
brilliant
thoughts
engaged
her
mind.
A
glow
rested
on
them,
such
as
tinged
her
complexion.
Now
followed
a
hot,
parched,
thirsty,
restless
night.
Towards
morning
one
terrible
dream
seized
her
like
a
tiger;
when
she
woke,
she
felt
and
knew
she
was
ill.
How
she
had
caught
the
fever
(fever
it
was)
she
could
not
tell.
Probably
in
her
late
walk
home,
some
sweet,
poisoned
breeze,
redolent
of
honey
dew
and
miasma,
had
passed
into
her
lungs
and
veins,
and
finding
there
already
a
fever
of
mental
excitement,
and
a
languor
of
long
conflict
and
habitual
sadness,
had
fanned
the
spark
to
flame,
and
left
a
well
lit
fire
behind
it.
It
seemed,
however,
but
a
gentle
fire.
After
two
hot
days
and
worried
nights,
there
was
no
violence
in
the
symptoms,
and
neither
her
uncle,
nor
Fanny,
nor
the
doctor,
nor
Miss
Keeldar,
when
she
called,
had
any
fear
for
her.
A
few
days
would
restore
her,
every
one
believed.
The
few
days
passed,
and
though
it
was
still
thought
it
could
not
long
delay
the
revival
had
not
begun.
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
had
visited
her
daily
being
present
in
her
chamber
one
morning
when
she
had
been
ill
a
fortnight
watched
her
very
narrowly
for
some
minutes.
She
took
her
hand
and
placed
her
finger
on
her
wrist;
then,
quietly
leaving
the
chamber,
she
went
to
Mr.
Helstone's
study.
With
him
she
remained
closeted
a
long
time
half
the
morning.
On
returning
to
her
sick
young
friend,
she
laid
aside
shawl
and
bonnet.
She
stood
awhile
at
the
bedside,
one
hand
placed
in
the
other,
gently
rocking
herself
to
and
fro,
in
an
attitude
and
with
a
movement
habitual
to
her.
At
last
she
said,
"I
have
sent
Fanny
to
Fieldhead
to
fetch
a
few
things
for
me,
such
as
I
shall
want
during
a
short
stay
here.
It
is
my
wish
to
remain
with
you
till
you
are
better.
Your
uncle
kindly
permits
my
attendance.
Will
it
to
yourself
be
acceptable,
Caroline?"
"I
am
sorry
you
should
take
such
needless
trouble.
I
do
not
feel
very
ill,
but
I
cannot
refuse
resolutely.
It
will
be
such
comfort
to
know
you
are
in
the
house,
to
see
you
sometimes
in
the
room;
but
don't
confine
yourself
on
my
account,
dear
Mrs.
Pryor.
Fanny
nurses
me
very
well."
Mrs.
Pryor,
bending
over
the
pale
little
sufferer,
was
now
smoothing
the
hair
under
her
cap,
and
gently
raising
her
pillow.
As
she
performed
these
offices,
Caroline,
smiling,
lifted
her
face
to
kiss
her.
"Are
you
free
from
pain?
Are
you
tolerably
at
ease?"
was
inquired
in
a
low,
earnest
voice,
as
the
self
elected
nurse
yielded
to
the
caress.
"I
think
I
am
almost
happy."
"You
wish
to
drink?
Your
lips
are
parched."
She
held
a
glass
filled
with
some
cooling
beverage
to
her
mouth.
"Have
you
eaten
anything
to
day,
Caroline?"
"I
cannot
eat."
"But
soon
your
appetite
will
return;
it
must
return
that
is,
I
pray
God
it
may."
In
laying
her
again
on
the
couch,
she
encircled
her
in
her
arms;
and
while
so
doing,
by
a
movement
which
seemed
scarcely
voluntary,
she
drew
her
to
her
heart,
and
held
her
close
gathered
an
instant.
"I
shall
hardly
wish
to
get
well,
that
I
may
keep
you
always,"
said
Caroline.
Mrs.
Pryor
did
not
smile
at
this
speech.
Over
her
features
ran
a
tremor,
which
for
some
minutes
she
was
absorbed
in
repressing.
"You
are
more
used
to
Fanny
than
to
me,"
she
remarked
ere
long.
"I
should
think
my
attendance
must
seem
strange,
officious?"
"No;
quite
natural,
and
very
soothing.
You
must
have
been
accustomed
to
wait
on
sick
people,
ma'am.
You
move
about
the
room
so
softly,
and
you
speak
so
quietly,
and
touch
me
so
gently."
"I
am
dexterous
in
nothing,
my
dear.
You
will
often
find
me
awkward,
but
never
negligent."
Negligent,
indeed,
she
was
not.
From
that
hour
Fanny
and
Eliza
became
ciphers
in
the
sick
room.
Mrs.
Pryor
made
it
her
domain;
she
performed
all
its
duties;
she
lived
in
it
day
and
night.
The
patient
remonstrated
faintly,
however,
from
the
first,
and
not
at
all
ere
long.
Loneliness
and
gloom
were
now
banished
from
her
bedside;
protection
and
solace
sat
there
instead.
She
and
her
nurse
coalesced
in
wondrous
union.
Caroline
was
usually
pained
to
require
or
receive
much
attendance.
Mrs.
Pryor,
under
ordinary
circumstances,
had
neither
the
habit
nor
the
art
of
performing
little
offices
of
service;
but
all
now
passed
with
such
ease,
so
naturally,
that
the
patient
was
as
willing
to
be
cherished
as
the
nurse
was
bent
on
cherishing;
no
sign
of
weariness
in
the
latter
ever
reminded
the
former
that
she
ought
to
be
anxious.
There
was,
in
fact,
no
very
hard
duty
to
perform;
but
a
hireling
might
have
found
it
hard.
With
all
this
care
it
seemed
strange
the
sick
girl
did
not
get
well;
yet
such
was
the
case.
She
wasted
like
any
snow
wreath
in
thaw;
she
faded
like
any
flower
in
drought.
Miss
Keeldar,
on
whose
thoughts
danger
or
death
seldom
intruded,
had
at
first
entertained
no
fears
at
all
for
her
friend;
but
seeing
her
change
and
sink
from
time
to
time
when
she
paid
her
visits,
alarm
clutched
her
heart.
She
went
to
Mr.
Helstone
and
expressed
herself
with
so
much
energy
that
that
gentleman
was
at
last
obliged,
however
unwillingly,
to
admit
the
idea
that
his
niece
was
ill
of
something
more
than
a
migraine;
and
when
Mrs.
Pryor
came
and
quietly
demanded
a
physician,
he
said
she
might
send
for
two
if
she
liked.
One
came,
but
that
one
was
an
oracle.
He
delivered
a
dark
saying
of
which
the
future
was
to
solve
the
mystery,
wrote
some
prescriptions,
gave
some
directions
the
whole
with
an
air
of
crushing
authority
pocketed
his
fee,
and
went.
Probably
he
knew
well
enough
he
could
do
no
good,
but
didn't
like
to
say
so.
Still,
no
rumour
of
serious
illness
got
wind
in
the
neighbourhood.
At
Hollow's
Cottage
it
was
thought
that
Caroline
had
only
a
severe
cold,
she
having
written
a
note
to
Hortense
to
that
effect;
and
mademoiselle
contented
herself
with
sending
two
pots
of
currant
jam,
a
recipe
for
a
tisane,
and
a
note
of
advice.
Mrs.
Yorke
being
told
that
a
physician
had
been
summoned,
sneered
at
the
hypochondriac
fancies
of
the
rich
and
idle,
who,
she
said,
having
nothing
but
themselves
to
think
about,
must
needs
send
for
a
doctor
if
only
so
much
as
their
little
finger
ached.
The
"rich
and
idle,"
represented
in
the
person
of
Caroline,
were
meantime
falling
fast
into
a
condition
of
prostration,
whose
quickly
consummated
debility
puzzled
all
who
witnessed
it
except
one;
for
that
one
alone
reflected
how
liable
is
the
undermined
structure
to
sink
in
sudden
ruin.
Sick
people
often
have
fancies
inscrutable
to
ordinary
attendants,
and
Caroline
had
one
which
even
her
tender
nurse
could
not
at
first
explain.
On
a
certain
day
in
the
week,
at
a
certain
hour,
she
would
whether
worse
or
better
entreat
to
be
taken
up
and
dressed,
and
suffered
to
sit
in
her
chair
near
the
window.
This
station
she
would
retain
till
noon
was
past.
Whatever
degree
of
exhaustion
or
debility
her
wan
aspect
betrayed,
she
still
softly
put
off
all
persuasion
to
seek
repose
until
the
church
clock
had
duly
tolled
midday.
The
twelve
strokes
sounded,
she
grew
docile,
and
would
meekly
lie
down.
Returned
to
the
couch,
she
usually
buried
her
face
deep
in
the
pillow,
and
drew
the
coverlets
close
round
her,
as
if
to
shut
out
the
world
and
sun,
of
which
she
was
tired.
More
than
once,
as
she
thus
lay,
a
slight
convulsion
shook
the
sick
bed,
and
a
faint
sob
broke
the
silence
round
it.
These
things
were
not
unnoted
by
Mrs.
Pryor.
One
Tuesday
morning,
as
usual,
she
had
asked
leave
to
rise,
and
now
she
sat
wrapped
in
her
white
dressing
gown,
leaning
forward
in
the
easy
chair,
gazing
steadily
and
patiently
from
the
lattice.
Mrs.
Pryor
was
seated
a
little
behind,
knitting
as
it
seemed,
but,
in
truth,
watching
her.
A
change
crossed
her
pale,
mournful
brow,
animating
its
languor;
a
light
shot
into
her
faded
eyes,
reviving
their
lustre;
she
half
rose
and
looked
earnestly
out.
Mrs.
Pryor,
drawing
softly
near,
glanced
over
her
shoulder.
From
this
window
was
visible
the
churchyard,
beyond
it
the
road;
and
there,
riding
sharply
by,
appeared
a
horseman.
The
figure
was
not
yet
too
remote
for
recognition.
Mrs.
Pryor
had
long
sight;
she
knew
Mr.
Moore.
Just
as
an
intercepting
rising
ground
concealed
him
from
view,
the
clock
struck
twelve.
"May
I
lie
down
again?"
asked
Caroline.
Her
nurse
assisted
her
to
bed.
Having
laid
her
down
and
drawn
the
curtain,
she
stood
listening
near.
The
little
couch
trembled,
the
suppressed
sob
stirred
the
air.
A
contraction
as
of
anguish
altered
Mrs.
Pryor's
features;
she
wrung
her
hands;
half
a
groan
escaped
her
lips.
She
now
remembered
that
Tuesday
was
Whinbury
market
day.
Mr.
Moore
must
always
pass
the
rectory
on
his
way
thither,
just
ere
noon
of
that
day.
Caroline
wore
continually
round
her
neck
a
slender
braid
of
silk,
attached
to
which
was
some
trinket.
Mrs.
Pryor
had
seen
the
bit
of
gold
glisten,
but
had
not
yet
obtained
a
fair
view
of
it.
Her
patient
never
parted
with
it.
When
dressed
it
was
hidden
in
her
bosom;
as
she
lay
in
bed
she
always
held
it
in
her
hand.
That
Tuesday
afternoon
the
transient
doze
more
like
lethargy
than
sleep
which
sometimes
abridged
the
long
days,
had
stolen
over
her.
The
weather
was
hot.
While
turning
in
febrile
restlessness,
she
had
pushed
the
coverlets
a
little
aside.
Mrs.
Pryor
bent
to
replace
them.
The
small,
wasted
hand,
lying
nerveless
on
the
sick
girl's
breast,
clasped
as
usual
her
jealously
guarded
treasure.
Those
fingers
whose
attenuation
it
gave
pain
to
see
were
now
relaxed
in
sleep.
Mrs.
Pryor
gently
disengaged
the
braid,
drawing
out
a
tiny
locket
a
slight
thing
it
was,
such
as
it
suited
her
small
purse
to
purchase.
Under
its
crystal
face
appeared
a
curl
of
black
hair,
too
short
and
crisp
to
have
been
severed
from
a
female
head.
Some
agitated
movement
occasioned
a
twitch
of
the
silken
chain.
The
sleeper
started
and
woke.
Her
thoughts
were
usually
now
somewhat
scattered
on
waking,
her
look
generally
wandering.
Half
rising,
as
if
in
terror,
she
exclaimed,
"Don't
take
it
from
me,
Robert!
Don't!
It
is
my
last
comfort;
let
me
keep
it.
I
never
tell
any
one
whose
hair
it
is;
I
never
show
it."
Mrs.
Pryor
had
already
disappeared
behind
the
curtain.
Reclining
far
back
in
a
deep
arm
chair
by
the
bedside,
she
was
withdrawn
from
view.
Caroline
looked
abroad
into
the
chamber;
she
thought
it
empty.
As
her
stray
ideas
returned
slowly,
each
folding
its
weak
wings
on
the
mind's
sad
shore,
like
birds
exhausted,
beholding
void,
and
perceiving
silence
round
her,
she
believed
herself
alone.
Collected
she
was
not
yet;
perhaps
healthy
self
possession
and
self
control
were
to
be
hers
no
more;
perhaps
that
world
the
strong
and
prosperous
live
in
had
already
rolled
from
beneath
her
feet
for
ever.
So,
at
least,
it
often
seemed
to
herself.
In
health
she
had
never
been
accustomed
to
think
aloud,
but
now
words
escaped
her
lips
unawares.
"Oh,
I
should
see
him
once
more
before
all
is
over!
Heaven
might
favour
me
thus
far!"
she
cried.
"God
grant
me
a
little
comfort
before
I
die!"
was
her
humble
petition.
"But
he
will
not
know
I
am
ill
till
I
am
gone,
and
he
will
come
when
they
have
laid
me
out,
and
I
am
senseless,
cold,
and
stiff.
"What
can
my
departed
soul
feel
then?
Can
it
see
or
know
what
happens
to
the
clay?
Can
spirits,
through
any
medium,
communicate
with
living
flesh?
Can
the
dead
at
all
revisit
those
they
leave?
Can
they
come
in
the
elements?
Will
wind,
water,
fire,
lend
me
a
path
to
Moore?
"Is
it
for
nothing
the
wind
sounds
almost
articulately
sometimes
sings
as
I
have
lately
heard
it
sing
at
night
or
passes
the
casement
sobbing,
as
if
for
sorrow
to
come?
Does
nothing,
then,
haunt
it,
nothing
inspire
it?
"Why,
it
suggested
to
me
words
one
night;
it
poured
a
strain
which
I
could
have
written
down,
only
I
was
appalled,
and
dared
not
rise
to
seek
pencil
and
paper
by
the
dim
watch
light.
"What
is
that
electricity
they
speak
of,
whose
changes
make
us
well
or
ill,
whose
lack
or
excess
blasts,
whose
even
balance
revives?
What
are
all
those
influences
that
are
about
us
in
the
atmosphere,
that
keep
playing
over
our
nerves
like
fingers
on
stringed
instruments,
and
call
forth
now
a
sweet
note,
and
now
a
wail
now
an
exultant
swell,
and
anon
the
saddest
cadence?
"Where
is
the
other
world?
In
what
will
another
life
consist?
Why
do
I
ask?
Have
I
not
cause
to
think
that
the
hour
is
hasting
but
too
fast
when
the
veil
must
be
rent
for
me?
Do
I
not
know
the
Grand
Mystery
is
likely
to
burst
prematurely
on
me?
Great
Spirit,
in
whose
goodness
I
confide,
whom,
as
my
Father,
I
have
petitioned
night
and
morning
from
early
infancy,
help
the
weak
creation
of
Thy
hands!
Sustain
me
through
the
ordeal
I
dread
and
must
undergo!
Give
me
strength!
Give
me
patience!
Give
me
oh,
give
me
FAITH!"
She
fell
back
on
her
pillow.
Mrs.
Pryor
found
means
to
steal
quietly
from
the
room.
She
re
entered
it
soon
after,
apparently
as
composed
as
if
she
had
really
not
overheard
this
strange
soliloquy.
The
next
day
several
callers
came.
It
had
become
known
that
Miss
Helstone
was
worse.
Mr.
Hall
and
his
sister
Margaret
arrived.
Both,
after
they
had
been
in
the
sickroom,
quitted
it
in
tears;
they
had
found
the
patient
more
altered
than
they
expected.
Hortense
Moore
came.
Caroline
seemed
stimulated
by
her
presence.
She
assured
her,
smiling,
she
was
not
dangerously
ill;
she
talked
to
her
in
a
low
voice,
but
cheerfully.
During
her
stay,
excitement
kept
up
the
flush
of
her
complexion;
she
looked
better.
"How
is
Mr.
Robert?"
asked
Mrs.
Pryor,
as
Hortense
was
preparing
to
take
leave.
"He
was
very
well
when
he
left."
"Left!
Is
he
gone
from
home?"
It
was
then
explained
that
some
police
intelligence
about
the
rioters
of
whom
he
was
in
pursuit
had,
that
morning,
called
him
away
to
Birmingham,
and
probably
a
fortnight
might
elapse
ere
he
returned.
"He
is
not
aware
that
Miss
Helstone
is
very
ill?"
"Oh
no!
He
thought,
like
me,
that
she
had
only
a
bad
cold."
After
this
visit,
Mrs.
Pryor
took
care
not
to
approach
Caroline's
couch
for
above
an
hour.
She
heard
her
weep,
and
dared
not
look
on
her
tears.
As
evening
closed
in,
she
brought
her
some
tea.
Caroline,
opening
her
eyes
from
a
moment's
slumber,
viewed
her
nurse
with
an
unrecognizing
glance.
"I
smelt
the
honeysuckles
in
the
glen
this
summer
morning,"
she
said,
"as
I
stood
at
the
counting
house
window."
Strange
words
like
these
from
pallid
lips
pierce
a
loving
listener's
heart
more
poignantly
than
steel.
They
sound
romantic,
perhaps,
in
books;
in
real
life
they
are
harrowing.
"My
darling,
do
you
know
me?"
said
Mrs.
Pryor.
"I
went
in
to
call
Robert
to
breakfast.
I
have
been
with
him
in
the
garden.
He
asked
me
to
go.
A
heavy
dew
has
refreshed
the
flowers.
The
peaches
are
ripening."
"My
darling!
my
darling!"
again
and
again
repeated
the
nurse.
"I
thought
it
was
daylight
long
after
sunrise.
It
looks
dark.
Is
the
moon
now
set?"
That
moon,
lately
risen,
was
gazing
full
and
mild
upon
her.
Floating
in
deep
blue
space,
it
watched
her
unclouded.
"Then
it
is
not
morning?
I
am
not
at
the
cottage?
Who
is
this?
I
see
a
shape
at
my
bedside."
"It
is
myself
it
is
your
friend
your
nurse
your
Lean
your
head
on
my
shoulder.
Collect
yourself."
In
a
lower
tone
"O
God,
take
pity!
Give
her
life,
and
me
strength!
Send
me
courage!
Teach
me
words!"
Some
minutes
passed
in
silence.
The
patient
lay
mute
and
passive
in
the
trembling
arms,
on
the
throbbing
bosom
of
the
nurse.
"I
am
better
now,"
whispered
Caroline
at
last,
"much
better.
I
feel
where
I
am.
This
is
Mrs.
Pryor
near
me.
I
was
dreaming.
I
talk
when
I
wake
up
from
dreams;
people
often
do
in
illness.
How
fast
your
heart
beats,
ma'am!
Do
not
be
afraid."
"It
is
not
fear,
child
only
a
little
anxiety,
which
will
pass.
I
have
brought
you
some
tea,
Cary.
Your
uncle
made
it
himself.
You
know
he
says
he
can
make
a
better
cup
of
tea
than
any
housewife
can.
Taste
it.
He
is
concerned
to
hear
that
you
eat
so
little;
he
would
be
glad
if
you
had
a
better
appetite."
"I
am
thirsty.
Let
me
drink."
She
drank
eagerly.
"What
o'clock
is
it,
ma'am?"
she
asked.
"Past
nine."
"Not
later?
Oh!
I
have
yet
a
long
night
before
me.
But
the
tea
has
made
me
strong.
I
will
sit
up."
Mrs.
Pryor
raised
her,
and
arranged
her
pillows.
"Thank
Heaven!
I
am
not
always
equally
miserable,
and
ill,
and
hopeless.
The
afternoon
has
been
bad
since
Hortense
went;
perhaps
the
evening
may
be
better.
It
is
a
fine
night,
I
think?
The
moon
shines
clear."
"Very
fine
a
perfect
summer
night.
The
old
church
tower
gleams
white
almost
as
silver."
"And
does
the
churchyard
look
peaceful?"
"Yes,
and
the
garden
also.
Dew
glistens
on
the
foliage."
"Can
you
see
many
long
weeds
and
nettles
amongst
the
graves?
or
do
they
look
turfy
and
flowery?"
"I
see
closed
daisy
heads
gleaming
like
pearls
on
some
mounds.
Thomas
has
mown
down
the
dock
leaves
and
rank
grass,
and
cleared
all
away."
"I
always
like
that
to
be
done;
it
soothes
one's
mind
to
see
the
place
in
order.
And,
I
dare
say,
within
the
church
just
now
that
moonlight
shines
as
softly
as
in
my
room.
It
will
fall
through
the
east
window
full
on
the
Helstone
monument.
When
I
close
my
eyes
I
seem
to
see
poor
papa's
epitaph
in
black
letters
on
the
white
marble.
There
is
plenty
of
room
for
other
inscriptions
underneath."
"William
Farren
came
to
look
after
your
flowers
this
morning.
He
was
afraid,
now
you
cannot
tend
them
yourself,
they
would
be
neglected.
He
has
taken
two
of
your
favourite
plants
home
to
nurse
for
you."
"If
I
were
to
make
a
will,
I
would
leave
William
all
my
plants;
Shirley
my
trinkets
except
one,
which
must
not
be
taken
off
my
neck;
and
you,
ma'am,
my
books."
After
a
pause
"Mrs.
Pryor,
I
feel
a
longing
wish
for
something."
"For
what,
Caroline?"
"You
know
I
always
delight
to
hear
you
sing.
Sing
me
a
hymn
just
now.
Sing
that
hymn
which
begins,
'Our
God,
our
help
in
ages
past,
Our
hope
for
years
to
come,
Our
shelter
from
the
stormy
blast,
Our
refuge,
haven,
home!'"
Mrs.
Pryor
at
once
complied.
No
wonder
Caroline
liked
to
hear
her
sing.
Her
voice,
even
in
speaking,
was
sweet
and
silver
clear;
in
song
it
was
almost
divine.
Neither
flute
nor
dulcimer
has
tones
so
pure.
But
the
tone
was
secondary,
compared
to
the
expression
which
trembled
through
a
tender
vibration
from
a
feeling
heart.
The
servants
in
the
kitchen,
hearing
the
strain,
stole
to
the
stair
foot
to
listen.
Even
old
Helstone,
as
he
walked
in
the
garden,
pondering
over
the
unaccountable
and
feeble
nature
of
women,
stood
still
amongst
his
borders
to
catch
the
mournful
melody
more
distinctly.
Why
it
reminded
him
of
his
forgotten
dead
wife,
he
could
not
tell;
nor
why
it
made
him
more
concerned
than
he
had
hitherto
been
for
Caroline's
fading
girlhood.
He
was
glad
to
recollect
that
he
had
promised
to
pay
Wynne,
the
magistrate,
a
visit
that
evening.
Low
spirits
and
gloomy
thoughts
were
very
much
his
aversion.
When
they
attacked
him
he
usually
found
means
to
make
them
march
in
double
quick
time.
The
hymn
followed
him
faintly
as
he
crossed
the
fields.
He
hastened
his
customary
sharp
pace,
that
he
might
get
beyond
its
reach.
"Thy
word
commands
our
flesh
to
dust,
'Return,
ye
sons
of
men;'
All
nations
rose
from
earth
at
first,
And
turn
to
earth
again.
"A
thousand
ages
in
Thy
sight
Are
like
an
evening
gone
Short
as
the
watch
that
ends
the
night
Before
the
rising
sun.
"Time,
like
an
ever
rolling
stream,
Bears
all
its
sons
away;
They
fly,
forgotten,
as
a
dream
Dies
at
the
opening
day.
"Like
flowery
fields,
the
nations
stand,
Fresh
in
the
morning
light;
The
flowers
beneath
the
mower's
hand
Lie
withering
ere
'tis
night.
"Our
God,
our
help
in
ages
past,
Our
hope
for
years
to
come,
Be
Thou
our
guard
while
troubles
last
O
Father,
be
our
home!"
"Now
sing
a
song
a
Scottish
song,"
suggested
Caroline,
when
the
hymn
was
over
"'Ye
banks
and
braes
o'
bonnie
Doon.'"
Again
Mrs.
Pryor
obeyed,
or
essayed
to
obey.
At
the
close
of
the
first
stanza
she
stopped.
She
could
get
no
further.
Her
full
heart
flowed
over.
"You
are
weeping
at
the
pathos
of
the
air.
Come
here,
and
I
will
comfort
you,"
said
Caroline,
in
a
pitying
accent.
Mrs.
Pryor
came.
She
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
her
patient's
bed,
and
allowed
the
wasted
arms
to
encircle
her.
"You
often
soothe
me;
let
me
soothe
you,"
murmured
the
young
girl,
kissing
her
cheek.
"I
hope,"
she
added,
"it
is
not
for
me
you
weep?"
No
answer
followed.
"Do
you
think
I
shall
not
get
better?
I
do
not
feel
very
ill
only
weak."
"But
your
mind,
Caroline
your
mind
is
crushed.
Your
heart
is
almost
broken;
you
have
been
so
neglected,
so
repulsed,
left
so
desolate."
"I
believe
grief
is,
and
always
has
been,
my
worst
ailment.
I
sometimes
think
if
an
abundant
gush
of
happiness
came
on
me
I
could
revive
yet."
"Do
you
wish
to
live?"
"I
have
no
object
in
life."
"You
love
me,
Caroline?"
"Very
much
very
truly
inexpressibly
sometimes.
Just
now
I
feel
as
if
I
could
almost
grow
to
your
heart."
"I
will
return
directly,
dear,"
remarked
Mrs.
Pryor,
as
she
laid
Caroline
down.
Quitting
her,
she
glided
to
the
door,
softly
turned
the
key
in
the
lock,
ascertained
that
it
was
fast,
and
came
back.
She
bent
over
her.
She
threw
back
the
curtain
to
admit
the
moonlight
more
freely.
She
gazed
intently
on
her
face.
"Then,
if
you
love
me,"
said
she,
speaking
quickly,
with
an
altered
voice;
"if
you
feel
as
if,
to
use
your
own
words,
you
could
'grow
to
my
heart,'
it
will
be
neither
shock
nor
pain
for
you
to
know
that
that
heart
is
the
source
whence
yours
was
filled;
that
from
my
veins
issued
the
tide
which
flows
in
yours;
that
you
are
mine
my
daughter
my
own
child."
"Mrs.
Pryor
"
"My
own
child!"
"That
is
that
means
you
have
adopted
me?"
"It
means
that,
if
I
have
given
you
nothing
else,
I
at
least
gave
you
life;
that
I
bore
you,
nursed
you;
that
I
am
your
true
mother.
No
other
woman
can
claim
the
title;
it
is
mine."
"But
Mrs.
James
Helstone
but
my
father's
wife,
whom
I
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
seen,
she
is
my
mother?"
"She
is
your
mother.
James
Helstone
was
my
husband.
I
say
you
are
mine.
I
have
proved
it.
I
thought
perhaps
you
were
all
his,
which
would
have
been
a
cruel
dispensation
for
me.
I
find
it
is
not
so.
God
permitted
me
to
be
the
parent
of
my
child's
mind.
It
belongs
to
me;
it
is
my
property
my
right.
These
features
are
James's
own.
He
had
a
fine
face
when
he
was
young,
and
not
altered
by
error.
Papa,
my
darling,
gave
you
your
blue
eyes
and
soft
brown
hair;
he
gave
you
the
oval
of
your
face
and
the
regularity
of
your
lineaments
the
outside
he
conferred;
but
the
heart
and
the
brain
are
mine.
The
germs
are
from
me,
and
they
are
improved,
they
are
developed
to
excellence.
I
esteem
and
approve
my
child
as
highly
as
I
do
most
fondly
love
her."
"Is
what
I
hear
true?
Is
it
no
dream?"
"I
wish
it
were
as
true
that
the
substance
and
colour
of
health
were
restored
to
your
cheek."
"My
own
mother!
is
she
one
I
can
be
so
fond
of
as
I
can
of
you?
People
generally
did
not
like
her
so
I
have
been
given
to
understand."
"They
told
you
that?
Well,
your
mother
now
tells
you
that,
not
having
the
gift
to
please
people
generally,
for
their
approbation
she
does
not
care.
Her
thoughts
are
centred
in
her
child.
Does
that
child
welcome
or
reject
her?"
"But
if
you
are
my
mother,
the
world
is
all
changed
to
me.
Surely
I
can
live.
I
should
like
to
recover
"
"You
must
recover.
You
drew
life
and
strength
from
my
breast
when
you
were
a
tiny,
fair
infant,
over
whose
blue
eyes
I
used
to
weep,
fearing
I
beheld
in
your
very
beauty
the
sign
of
qualities
that
had
entered
my
heart
like
iron,
and
pierced
through
my
soul
like
a
sword.
Daughter!
we
have
been
long
parted;
I
return
now
to
cherish
you
again."
She
held
her
to
her
bosom;
she
cradled
her
in
her
arms;
she
rocked
her
softly,
as
if
lulling
a
young
child
to
sleep.
"My
mother
my
own
mother!"
The
offspring
nestled
to
the
parent;
that
parent,
feeling
the
endearment
and
hearing
the
appeal,
gathered
her
closer
still.
She
covered
her
with
noiseless
kisses;
she
murmured
love
over
her,
like
a
cushat
fostering
its
young.
There
was
silence
in
the
room
for
a
long
while.
"Does
my
uncle
know?"
"Your
uncle
knows.
I
told
him
when
I
first
came
to
stay
with
you
here."
"Did
you
recognize
me
when
we
first
met
at
Fieldhead?"
"How
could
it
be
otherwise?
Mr.
and
Miss
Helstone
being
announced,
I
was
prepared
to
see
my
child."
"It
was
that,
then,
which
moved
you.
I
saw
you
disturbed."
"You
saw
nothing,
Caroline;
I
can
cover
my
feelings.
You
can
never
tell
what
an
age
of
strange
sensation
I
lived,
during
the
two
minutes
that
elapsed
between
the
report
of
your
name
and
your
entrance.
You
can
never
tell
how
your
look,
mien,
carriage,
shook
me."
"Why?
Were
you
disappointed?"
"What
will
she
be
like?
I
had
asked
myself;
and
when
I
saw
what
you
were
like,
I
could
have
dropped."
"Mamma,
why?"
"I
trembled
in
your
presence.
I
said,
I
will
never
own
her;
she
shall
never
know
me."
"But
I
said
and
did
nothing
remarkable.
I
felt
a
little
diffident
at
the
thought
of
an
introduction
to
strangers
that
was
all."
"I
soon
saw
you
were
diffident.
That
was
the
first
thing
which
reassured
me.
Had
you
been
rustic,
clownish,
awkward,
I
should
have
been
content."
"You
puzzle
me."
"I
had
reason
to
dread
a
fair
outside,
to
mistrust
a
popular
bearing,
to
shudder
before
distinction,
grace,
and
courtesy.
Beauty
and
affability
had
come
in
my
way
when
I
was
recluse,
desolate,
young,
and
ignorant
a
toil
worn
governess
perishing
of
uncheered
labour,
breaking
down
before
her
time.
These,
Caroline,
when
they
smiled
on
me,
I
mistook
for
angels.
I
followed
them
home;
and
when
into
their
hands
I
had
given
without
reserve
my
whole
chance
of
future
happiness,
it
was
my
lot
to
witness
a
transfiguration
on
the
domestic
hearth
to
see
the
white
mask
lifted,
the
bright
disguise
put
away,
and
opposite
me
sat
down
O
God,
I
have
suffered!"
She
sank
on
the
pillow.
"I
have
suffered!
None
saw
none
knew.
There
was
no
sympathy,
no
redemption,
no
redress!"
"Take
comfort,
mother.
It
is
over
now."
"It
is
over,
and
not
fruitlessly.
I
tried
to
keep
the
word
of
His
patience.
He
kept
me
in
the
days
of
my
anguish.
I
was
afraid
with
terror
I
was
troubled.
Through
great
tribulation
He
brought
me
through
to
a
salvation
revealed
in
this
last
time.
My
fear
had
torment;
He
has
cast
it
out.
He
has
given
me
in
its
stead
perfect
love.
But,
Caroline
"
Thus
she
invoked
her
daughter
after
a
pause.
"Mother!"
"I
charge
you,
when
you
next
look
on
your
father's
monument,
to
respect
the
name
chiselled
there.
To
you
he
did
only
good.
On
you
he
conferred
his
whole
treasure
of
beauties,
nor
added
to
them
one
dark
defect.
All
you
derived
from
him
is
excellent.
You
owe
him
gratitude.
Leave,
between
him
and
me,
the
settlement
of
our
mutual
account.
Meddle
not.
God
is
the
arbiter.
This
world's
laws
never
came
near
us
never!
They
were
powerless
as
a
rotten
bulrush
to
protect
me
impotent
as
idiot
babblings
to
restrain
him!
As
you
said,
it
is
all
over
now;
the
grave
lies
between
us.
There
he
sleeps,
in
that
church.
To
his
dust
I
say
this
night,
what
I
have
never
said
before,
'James,
slumber
peacefully!
See!
your
terrible
debt
is
cancelled!
Look!
I
wipe
out
the
long,
black
account
with
my
own
hand!
James,
your
child
atones.
This
living
likeness
of
you
this
thing
with
your
perfect
features
this
one
good
gift
you
gave
me
has
nestled
affectionately
to
my
heart,
and
tenderly
called
me
"mother."
Husband,
rest
forgiven!'"
"Dearest
mother,
that
is
right!
Can
papa's
spirit
hear
us?
Is
he
comforted
to
know
that
we
still
love
him?"
"I
said
nothing
of
love.
I
spoke
of
forgiveness.
Mind
the
truth,
child;
I
said
nothing
of
love!
On
the
threshold
of
eternity,
should
he
be
there
to
see
me
enter,
will
I
maintain
that."
"O
mother,
you
must
have
suffered!"
"O
child,
the
human
heart
can
suffer!
It
can
hold
more
tears
than
the
ocean
holds
waters.
We
never
know
how
deep,
how
wide
it
is,
till
misery
begins
to
unbind
her
clouds,
and
fill
it
with
rushing
blackness."
"Mother,
forget."
"Forget!"
she
said,
with
the
strangest
spectre
of
a
laugh.
"The
north
pole
will
rush
to
the
south,
and
the
headlands
of
Europe
be
locked
into
the
bays
of
Australia
ere
I
forget."
"Hush,
mother!
Rest!
Be
at
peace!"
And
the
child
lulled
the
parent,
as
the
parent
had
erst
lulled
the
child.
At
last
Mrs.
Pryor
wept.
She
then
grew
calmer.
She
resumed
those
tender
cares
agitation
had
for
a
moment
suspended.
Replacing
her
daughter
on
the
couch,
she
smoothed
the
pillow
and
spread
the
sheet.
The
soft
hair
whose
locks
were
loosened
she
rearranged,
the
damp
brow
she
refreshed
with
a
cool,
fragrant
essence.
"Mamma,
let
them
bring
a
candle,
that
I
may
see
you;
and
tell
my
uncle
to
come
into
this
room
by
and
by.
I
want
to
hear
him
say
that
I
am
your
daughter.
And,
mamma,
take
your
supper
here.
Don't
leave
me
for
one
minute
to
night."
"O
Caroline,
it
is
well
you
are
gentle!
You
will
say
to
me,
Go,
and
I
shall
go;
Come,
and
I
shall
come;
Do
this,
and
I
shall
do
it.
You
inherit
a
certain
manner
as
well
as
certain
features.
It
will
always
be
'mamma'
prefacing
a
mandate
softly
spoken,
though,
from
you,
thank
God!
Well,"
she
added,
under
her
breath,
"he
spoke
softly
too,
once,
like
a
flute
breathing
tenderness;
and
then,
when
the
world
was
not
by
to
listen,
discords
that
split
the
nerves
and
curdled
the
blood
sounds
to
inspire
insanity."
"It
seems
so
natural,
mamma,
to
ask
you
for
this
and
that.
I
shall
want
nobody
but
you
to
be
near
me,
or
to
do
anything
for
me.
But
do
not
let
me
be
troublesome.
Check
me
if
I
encroach."
"You
must
not
depend
on
me
to
check
you;
you
must
keep
guard
over
yourself.
I
have
little
moral
courage;
the
want
of
it
is
my
bane.
It
is
that
which
has
made
me
an
unnatural
parent
which
has
kept
me
apart
from
my
child
during
the
ten
years
which
have
elapsed
since
my
husband's
death
left
me
at
liberty
to
claim
her.
It
was
that
which
first
unnerved
my
arms
and
permitted
the
infant
I
might
have
retained
a
while
longer
to
be
snatched
prematurely
from
their
embrace."
"How,
mamma?"
"I
let
you
go
as
a
babe,
because
you
were
pretty,
and
I
feared
your
loveliness,
deeming
it
the
stamp
of
perversity.
They
sent
me
your
portrait,
taken
at
eight
years
old;
that
portrait
confirmed
my
fears.
Had
it
shown
me
a
sunburnt
little
rustic
a
heavy,
blunt
featured,
commonplace
child
I
should
have
hastened
to
claim
you;
but
there,
under
the
silver
paper,
I
saw
blooming
the
delicacy
of
an
aristocratic
flower
'little
lady'
was
written
on
every
trait.
I
had
too
recently
crawled
from
under
the
yoke
of
the
fine
gentleman
escaped
galled,
crushed,
paralyzed,
dying
to
dare
to
encounter
his
still
finer
and
most
fairy
like
representative.
My
sweet
little
lady
overwhelmed
me
with
dismay;
her
air
of
native
elegance
froze
my
very
marrow.
In
my
experience
I
had
not
met
with
truth,
modesty,
good
principle
as
the
concomitants
of
beauty.
A
form
so
straight
and
fine,
I
argued,
must
conceal
a
mind
warped
and
cruel.
I
had
little
faith
in
the
power
of
education
to
rectify
such
a
mind;
or
rather,
I
entirely
misdoubted
my
own
ability
to
influence
it.
Caroline,
I
dared
not
undertake
to
rear
you.
I
resolved
to
leave
you
in
your
uncle's
hands.
Matthewson
Helstone
I
knew,
if
an
austere,
was
an
upright
man.
He
and
all
the
world
thought
hardly
of
me
for
my
strange,
unmotherly
resolve,
and
I
deserved
to
be
misjudged."
"Mamma,
why
did
you
call
yourself
Mrs.
Pryor?"
"It
was
a
name
in
my
mother's
family.
I
adopted
it
that
I
might
live
unmolested.
My
married
name
recalled
too
vividly
my
married
life;
I
could
not
bear
it.
Besides,
threats
were
uttered
of
forcing
me
to
return
to
bondage.
It
could
not
be.
Rather
a
bier
for
a
bed,
the
grave
for
a
home.
My
new
name
sheltered
me.
I
resumed
under
its
screen
my
old
occupation
of
teaching.
At
first
it
scarcely
procured
me
the
means
of
sustaining
life;
but
how
savoury
was
hunger
when
I
fasted
in
peace!
How
safe
seemed
the
darkness
and
chill
of
an
unkindled
hearth
when
no
lurid
reflection
from
terror
crimsoned
its
desolation!
How
serene
was
solitude,
when
I
feared
not
the
irruption
of
violence
and
vice!"
"But,
mamma,
you
have
been
in
this
neighbourhood
before.
How
did
it
happen
that
when
you
reappeared
here
with
Miss
Keeldar
you
were
not
recognized?"
"I
only
paid
a
short
visit,
as
a
bride,
twenty
years
ago,
and
then
I
was
very
different
to
what
I
am
now
slender,
almost
as
slender
as
my
daughter
is
at
this
day.
My
complexion,
my
very
features
are
changed;
my
hair,
my
style
of
dress
everything
is
altered.
You
cannot
fancy
me
a
slim
young
person,
attired
in
scanty
drapery
of
white
muslin,
with
bare
arms,
bracelets
and
necklace
of
beads,
and
hair
disposed
in
round
Grecian
curls
above
my
forehead?"
"You
must,
indeed,
have
been
different.
Mamma,
I
heard
the
front
door
open.
If
it
is
my
uncle
coming
in,
just
ask
him
to
step
upstairs,
and
let
me
hear
his
assurance
that
I
am
truly
awake
and
collected,
and
not
dreaming
or
delirious."
The
rector,
of
his
own
accord,
was
mounting
the
stairs,
and
Mrs.
Pryor
summoned
him
to
his
niece's
apartment.
"She's
not
worse,
I
hope?"
he
inquired
hastily.
"I
think
her
better.
She
is
disposed
to
converse;
she
seems
stronger."
"Good!"
said
he,
brushing
quickly
into
the
room.
"Ha,
Cary!
how
do?
Did
you
drink
my
cup
of
tea?
I
made
it
for
you
just
as
I
like
it
myself."
"I
drank
it
every
drop,
uncle.
It
did
me
good;
it
has
made
me
quite
alive.
I
have
a
wish
for
company,
so
I
begged
Mrs.
Pryor
to
call
you
in."
The
respected
ecclesiastic
looked
pleased,
and
yet
embarrassed.
He
was
willing
enough
to
bestow
his
company
on
his
sick
niece
for
ten
minutes,
since
it
was
her
whim
to
wish
it;
but
what
means
to
employ
for
her
entertainment
he
knew
not.
He
hemmed
he
fidgeted.
"You'll
be
up
in
a
trice,"
he
observed,
by
way
of
saying
something.
"The
little
weakness
will
soon
pass
off;
and
then
you
must
drink
port
wine
a
pipe,
if
you
can
and
eat
game
and
oysters.
I'll
get
them
for
you,
if
they
are
to
be
had
anywhere.
Bless
me!
we'll
make
you
as
strong
as
Samson
before
we're
done
with
you."
"Who
is
that
lady,
uncle,
standing
beside
you
at
the
bed
foot?"
"Good
God!"
he
ejaculated.
"She's
not
wandering,
is
she,
ma'am?"
Mrs.
Pryor
smiled.
"I
am
wandering
in
a
pleasant
world,"
said
Caroline,
in
a
soft,
happy
voice,
"and
I
want
you
to
tell
me
whether
it
is
real
or
visionary.
What
lady
is
that?
Give
her
a
name,
uncle."
"We
must
have
Dr.
Rile
again,
ma'am;
or
better
still,
MacTurk.
He's
less
of
a
humbug.
Thomas
must
saddle
the
pony
and
go
for
him."
"No;
I
don't
want
a
doctor.
Mamma
shall
be
my
only
physician.
Now,
do
you
understand,
uncle?"
Mr.
Helstone
pushed
up
his
spectacles
from
his
nose
to
his
forehead,
handled
his
snuff
box,
and
administered
to
himself
a
portion
of
the
contents.
Thus
fortified,
he
answered
briefly,
"I
see
daylight.
You've
told
her
then,
ma'am?"
"And
is
it
true?"
demanded
Caroline,
rising
on
her
pillow.
"Is
she
really
my
mother?"
"You
won't
cry,
or
make
any
scene,
or
turn
hysterical,
if
I
answer
Yes?"
"Cry!
I'd
cry
if
you
said
No.
It
would
be
terrible
to
be
disappointed
now.
But
give
her
a
name.
How
do
you
call
her?"
"I
call
this
stout
lady
in
a
quaint
black
dress,
who
looks
young
enough
to
wear
much
smarter
raiment,
if
she
would
I
call
her
Agnes
Helstone.
She
married
my
brother
James,
and
is
his
widow."
"And
my
mother?"
"What
a
little
sceptic
it
is!
Look
at
her
small
face,
Mrs.
Pryor,
scarcely
larger
than
the
palm
of
my
hand,
alive
with
acuteness
and
eagerness."
To
Caroline
"She
had
the
trouble
of
bringing
you
into
the
world
at
any
rate.
Mind
you
show
your
duty
to
her
by
quickly
getting
well,
and
repairing
the
waste
of
these
cheeks.
Heigh
ho!
she
used
to
be
plump.
What
she
has
done
with
it
all
I
can't,
for
the
life
of
me,
divine."
"If
wishing
to
get
well
will
help
me,
I
shall
not
be
long
sick.
This
morning
I
had
no
reason
and
no
strength
to
wish
it."
Fanny
here
tapped
at
the
door,
and
said
that
supper
was
ready.
"Uncle,
if
you
please,
you
may
send
me
a
little
bit
of
supper
anything
you
like,
from
your
own
plate.
That
is
wiser
than
going
into
hysterics,
is
it
not?"
"It
is
spoken
like
a
sage,
Cary.
See
if
I
don't
cater
for
you
judiciously.
When
women
are
sensible,
and,
above
all,
intelligible,
I
can
get
on
with
them.
It
is
only
the
vague,
superfine
sensations,
and
extremely
wire
drawn
notions,
that
put
me
about.
Let
a
woman
ask
me
to
give
her
an
edible
or
a
wearable
be
the
same
a
roc's
egg
or
the
breastplate
of
Aaron,
a
share
of
St.
John's
locusts
and
honey
or
the
leathern
girdle
about
his
loins
I
can,
at
least,
understand
the
demand;
but
when
they
pine
for
they
know
not
what
sympathy,
sentiment,
some
of
these
indefinite
abstractions
I
can't
do
it;
I
don't
know
it;
I
haven't
got
it.
Madam,
accept
my
arm."
Mrs.
Pryor
signified
that
she
should
stay
with
her
daughter
that
evening.
Helstone,
accordingly,
left
them
together.
He
soon
returned,
bringing
a
plate
in
his
own
consecrated
hand.
"This
is
chicken,"
he
said,
"but
we'll
have
partridge
to
morrow.
Lift
her
up,
and
put
a
shawl
over
her.
On
my
word,
I
understand
nursing.
Now,
here
is
the
very
same
little
silver
fork
you
used
when
you
first
came
to
the
rectory.
That
strikes
me
as
being
what
you
may
call
a
happy
thought
a
delicate
attention.
Take
it,
Cary,
and
munch
away
cleverly."
Caroline
did
her
best.
Her
uncle
frowned
to
see
that
her
powers
were
so
limited.
He
prophesied,
however,
great
things
for
the
future;
and
as
she
praised
the
morsel
he
had
brought,
and
smiled
gratefully
in
his
face,
he
stooped
over
her
pillow,
kissed
her,
and
said,
with
a
broken,
rugged
accent,
"Good
night,
bairnie!
God
bless
thee!"
Caroline
enjoyed
such
peaceful
rest
that
night,
circled
by
her
mother's
arms,
and
pillowed
on
her
breast,
that
she
forgot
to
wish
for
any
other
stay;
and
though
more
than
one
feverish
dream
came
to
her
in
slumber,
yet,
when
she
woke
up
panting,
so
happy
and
contented
a
feeling
returned
with
returning
consciousness
that
her
agitation
was
soothed
almost
as
soon
as
felt.
As
to
the
mother,
she
spent
the
night
like
Jacob
at
Peniel.
Till
break
of
day
she
wrestled
with
God
in
earnest
prayer.
Not
always
do
those
who
dare
such
divine
conflict
prevail.
Night
after
night
the
sweat
of
agony
may
burst
dark
on
the
forehead;
the
supplicant
may
cry
for
mercy
with
that
soundless
voice
the
soul
utters
when
its
appeal
is
to
the
Invisible.
"Spare
my
beloved,"
it
may
implore.
"Heal
my
life's
life.
Rend
not
from
me
what
long
affection
entwines
with
my
whole
nature.
God
of
heaven,
bend,
hear,
be
clement!"
And
after
this
cry
and
strife
the
sun
may
rise
and
see
him
worsted.
That
opening
morn,
which
used
to
salute
him
with
the
whisper
of
zephyrs,
the
carol
of
skylarks,
may
breathe,
as
its
first
accents,
from
the
dear
lips
which
colour
and
heat
have
quitted,
"Oh!
I
have
had
a
suffering
night.
This
morning
I
am
worse.
I
have
tried
to
rise.
I
cannot.
Dreams
I
am
unused
to
have
troubled
me."
Then
the
watcher
approaches
the
patient's
pillow,
and
sees
a
new
and
strange
moulding
of
the
familiar
features,
feels
at
once
that
the
insufferable
moment
draws
nigh,
knows
that
it
is
God's
will
his
idol
shall
be
broken,
and
bends
his
head,
and
subdues
his
soul
to
the
sentence
he
cannot
avert
and
scarce
can
bear.
Happy
Mrs.
Pryor!
She
was
still
praying,
unconscious
that
the
summer
sun
hung
above
the
hills,
when
her
child
softly
woke
in
her
arms.
No
piteous,
unconscious
moaning
sound
which
so
wastes
our
strength
that,
even
if
we
have
sworn
to
be
firm,
a
rush
of
unconquerable
tears
sweeps
away
the
oath
preceded
her
waking.
No
space
of
deaf
apathy
followed.
The
first
words
spoken
were
not
those
of
one
becoming
estranged
from
this
world,
and
already
permitted
to
stray
at
times
into
realms
foreign
to
the
living.
Caroline
evidently
remembered
with
clearness
what
had
happened.
"Mamma,
I
have
slept
so
well.
I
only
dreamed
and
woke
twice."
Mrs.
Pryor
rose
with
a
start,
that
her
daughter
might
not
see
the
joyful
tears
called
into
her
eyes
by
that
affectionate
word
"mamma,"
and
the
welcome
assurance
that
followed
it.
For
many
days
the
mother
dared
rejoice
only
with
trembling.
That
first
revival
seemed
like
the
flicker
of
a
dying
lamp.
If
the
flame
streamed
up
bright
one
moment,
the
next
it
sank
dim
in
the
socket.
Exhaustion
followed
close
on
excitement.
There
was
always
a
touching
endeavour
to
appear
better,
but
too
often
ability
refused
to
second
will;
too
often
the
attempt
to
bear
up
failed.
The
effort
to
eat,
to
talk,
to
look
cheerful,
was
unsuccessful.
Many
an
hour
passed
during
which
Mrs.
Pryor
feared
that
the
chords
of
life
could
never
more
be
strengthened,
though
the
time
of
their
breaking
might
be
deferred.
During
this
space
the
mother
and
daughter
seemed
left
almost
alone
in
the
neighbourhood.
It
was
the
close
of
August;
the
weather
was
fine
that
is
to
say,
it
was
very
dry
and
very
dusty,
for
an
arid
wind
had
been
blowing
from
the
east
this
month
past;
very
cloudless,
too,
though
a
pale
haze,
stationary
in
the
atmosphere,
seemed
to
rob
of
all
depth
of
tone
the
blue
of
heaven,
of
all
freshness
the
verdure
of
earth,
and
of
all
glow
the
light
of
day.
Almost
every
family
in
Briarfield
was
absent
on
an
excursion.
Miss
Keeldar
and
her
friends
were
at
the
seaside;
so
were
Mrs.
Yorke's
household.
Mr.
Hall
and
Louis
Moore,
between
whom
a
spontaneous
intimacy
seemed
to
have
arisen
the
result,
probably,
of
harmony
of
views
and
temperament
were
gone
"up
north"
on
a
pedestrian
excursion
to
the
Lakes.
Even
Hortense,
who
would
fain
have
stayed
at
home
and
aided
Mrs.
Pryor
in
nursing
Caroline,
had
been
so
earnestly
entreated
by
Miss
Mann
to
accompany
her
once
more
to
Wormwood
Wells,
in
the
hope
of
alleviating
sufferings
greatly
aggravated
by
the
insalubrious
weather,
that
she
felt
obliged
to
comply;
indeed,
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
refuse
a
request
that
at
once
appealed
to
her
goodness
of
heart,
and,
by
a
confession
of
dependency,
flattered
her
amour
propre.
As
for
Robert,
from
Birmingham
he
had
gone
on
to
London,
where
he
still
sojourned.
So
long
as
the
breath
of
Asiatic
deserts
parched
Caroline's
lips
and
fevered
her
veins,
her
physical
convalescence
could
not
keep
pace
with
her
returning
mental
tranquillity;
but
there
came
a
day
when
the
wind
ceased
to
sob
at
the
eastern
gable
of
the
rectory,
and
at
the
oriel
window
of
the
church.
A
little
cloud
like
a
man's
hand
arose
in
the
west;
gusts
from
the
same
quarter
drove
it
on
and
spread
it
wide;
wet
and
tempest
prevailed
a
while.
When
that
was
over
the
sun
broke
out
genially,
heaven
regained
its
azure,
and
earth
its
green;
the
livid
cholera
tint
had
vanished
from
the
face
of
nature;
the
hills
rose
clear
round
the
horizon,
absolved
from
that
pale
malaria
haze.
Caroline's
youth
could
now
be
of
some
avail
to
her,
and
so
could
her
mother's
nurture.
Both,
crowned
by
God's
blessing,
sent
in
the
pure
west
wind
blowing
soft
as
fresh
through
the
ever
open
chamber
lattice,
rekindled
her
long
languishing
energies.
At
last
Mrs.
Pryor
saw
that
it
was
permitted
to
hope:
a
genuine,
material
convalescence
had
commenced.
It
was
not
merely
Caroline's
smile
which
was
brighter,
or
her
spirits
which
were
cheered,
but
a
certain
look
had
passed
from
her
face
and
eye
a
look
dread
and
indescribable,
but
which
will
easily
be
recalled
by
those
who
have
watched
the
couch
of
dangerous
disease.
Long
before
the
emaciated
outlines
of
her
aspect
began
to
fill,
or
its
departed
colour
to
return,
a
more
subtle
change
took
place;
all
grew
softer
and
warmer.
Instead
of
a
marble
mask
and
glassy
eye,
Mrs.
Pryor
saw
laid
on
the
pillow
a
face
pale
and
wasted
enough,
perhaps
more
haggard
than
the
other
appearance,
but
less
awful;
for
it
was
a
sick,
living
girl,
not
a
mere
white
mould
or
rigid
piece
of
statuary.
Now,
too,
she
was
not
always
petitioning
to
drink.
The
words,
"I
am
so
thirsty,"
ceased
to
be
her
plaint.
Sometimes,
when
she
had
swallowed
a
morsel,
she
would
say
it
had
revived
her.
All
descriptions
of
food
were
no
longer
equally
distasteful;
she
could
be
induced,
sometimes,
to
indicate
a
preference.
With
what
trembling
pleasure
and
anxious
care
did
not
her
nurse
prepare
what
was
selected!
How
she
watched
her
as
she
partook
of
it!
Nourishment
brought
strength.
She
could
sit
up.
Then
she
longed
to
breathe
the
fresh
air,
to
revisit
her
flowers,
to
see
how
the
fruit
had
ripened.
Her
uncle,
always
liberal,
had
bought
a
garden
chair
for
her
express
use.
He
carried
her
down
in
his
own
arms,
and
placed
her
in
it
himself,
and
William
Farren
was
there
to
wheel
her
round
the
walks,
to
show
her
what
he
had
done
amongst
her
plants,
to
take
her
directions
for
further
work.
William
and
she
found
plenty
to
talk
about.
They
had
a
dozen
topics
in
common
interesting
to
them,
unimportant
to
the
rest
of
the
world.
They
took
a
similar
interest
in
animals,
birds,
insects,
and
plants;
they
held
similar
doctrines
about
humanity
to
the
lower
creation,
and
had
a
similar
turn
for
minute
observation
on
points
of
natural
history.
The
nest
and
proceedings
of
some
ground
bees,
which
had
burrowed
in
the
turf
under
an
old
cherry
tree,
was
one
subject
of
interest;
the
haunts
of
certain
hedge
sparrows,
and
the
welfare
of
certain
pearly
eggs
and
callow
fledglings,
another.
Had
Chambers's
Journal
existed
in
those
days,
it
would
certainly
have
formed
Miss
Helstone's
and
Farren's
favourite
periodical.
She
would
have
subscribed
for
it,
and
to
him
each
number
would
duly
have
been
lent;
both
would
have
put
implicit
faith
and
found
great
savour
in
its
marvellous
anecdotes
of
animal
sagacity.
This
is
a
digression,
but
it
suffices
to
explain
why
Caroline
would
have
no
other
hand
than
William's
to
guide
her
chair,
and
why
his
society
and
conversation
sufficed
to
give
interest
to
her
garden
airings.
Mrs.
Pryor,
walking
near,
wondered
how
her
daughter
could
be
so
much
at
ease
with
a
"man
of
the
people."
She
found
it
impossible
to
speak
to
him
otherwise
than
stiffly.
She
felt
as
if
a
great
gulf
lay
between
her
caste
and
his,
and
that
to
cross
it
or
meet
him
half
way
would
be
to
degrade
herself.
She
gently
asked
Caroline,
"Are
you
not
afraid,
my
dear,
to
converse
with
that
person
so
unreservedly?
He
may
presume,
and
become
troublesomely
garrulous."
"William
presume,
mamma?
You
don't
know
him.
He
never
presumes.
He
is
altogether
too
proud
and
sensitive
to
do
so.
William
has
very
fine
feelings."
And
Mrs.
Pryor
smiled
sceptically
at
the
naive
notion
of
that
rough
handed,
rough
headed,
fustian
clad
clown
having
"fine
feelings."
Farren,
for
his
part,
showed
Mrs.
Pryor
only
a
very
sulky
brow.
He
knew
when
he
was
misjudged,
and
was
apt
to
turn
unmanageable
with
such
as
failed
to
give
him
his
due.
The
evening
restored
Caroline
entirely
to
her
mother,
and
Mrs.
Pryor
liked
the
evening;
for
then,
alone
with
her
daughter,
no
human
shadow
came
between
her
and
what
she
loved.
During
the
day
she
would
have
her
stiff
demeanour
and
cool
moments,
as
was
her
wont.
Between
her
and
Mr.
Helstone
a
very
respectful
but
most
rigidly
ceremonious
intercourse
was
kept
up.
Anything
like
familiarity
would
have
bred
contempt
at
once
in
one
or
both
these
personages;
but
by
dint
of
strict
civility
and
well
maintained
distance
they
got
on
very
smoothly.
Towards
the
servants
Mrs.
Pryor's
bearing
was
not
uncourteous,
but
shy,
freezing,
ungenial.
Perhaps
it
was
diffidence
rather
than
pride
which
made
her
appear
so
haughty;
but,
as
was
to
be
expected,
Fanny
and
Eliza
failed
to
make
the
distinction,
and
she
was
unpopular
with
them
accordingly.
She
felt
the
effect
produced;
it
rendered
her
at
times
dissatisfied
with
herself
for
faults
she
could
not
help,
and
with
all
else
dejected,
chill,
and
taciturn.
This
mood
changed
to
Caroline's
influence,
and
to
that
influence
alone.
The
dependent
fondness
of
her
nursling,
the
natural
affection
of
her
child,
came
over
her
suavely.
Her
frost
fell
away,
her
rigidity
unbent;
she
grew
smiling
and
pliant.
Not
that
Caroline
made
any
wordy
profession
of
love
that
would
ill
have
suited
Mrs.
Pryor;
she
would
have
read
therein
the
proof
of
insincerity
but
she
hung
on
her
with
easy
dependence;
she
confided
in
her
with
fearless
reliance.
These
things
contented
the
mother's
heart.
She
liked
to
hear
her
daughter
say,
"Mamma,
do
this;"
"Please,
mamma,
fetch
me
that;"
"Mamma,
read
to
me;"
"Sing
a
little,
mamma."
Nobody
else
not
one
living
thing
had
ever
so
claimed
her
services,
so
looked
for
help
at
her
hand.
Other
people
were
always
more
or
less
reserved
and
stiff
with
her,
as
she
was
reserved
and
stiff
with
them;
other
people
betrayed
consciousness
of
and
annoyance
at
her
weak
points.
Caroline
no
more
showed
such
wounding
sagacity
or
reproachful
sensitiveness
now
than
she
had
done
when
a
suckling
of
three
months
old.
Yet
Caroline
could
find
fault.
Blind
to
the
constitutional
defects
that
were
incurable,
she
had
her
eyes
wide
open
to
the
acquired
habits
that
were
susceptible
of
remedy.
On
certain
points
she
would
quite
artlessly
lecture
her
parent;
and
that
parent,
instead
of
being
hurt,
felt
a
sensation
of
pleasure
in
discovering
that
the
girl
dared
lecture
her,
that
she
was
so
much
at
home
with
her.
"Mamma,
I
am
determined
you
shall
not
wear
that
old
gown
any
more.
Its
fashion
is
not
becoming;
it
is
too
strait
in
the
skirt.
You
shall
put
on
your
black
silk
every
afternoon.
In
that
you
look
nice;
it
suits
you.
And
you
shall
have
a
black
satin
dress
for
Sundays
a
real
satin,
not
a
satinet
or
any
of
the
shams.
And,
mamma,
when
you
get
the
new
one,
mind
you
must
wear
it."
"My
dear,
I
thought
of
the
black
silk
serving
me
as
a
best
dress
for
many
years
yet,
and
I
wished
to
buy
you
several
things."
"Nonsense,
mamma.
My
uncle
gives
me
cash
to
get
what
I
want.
You
know
he
is
generous
enough;
and
I
have
set
my
heart
on
seeing
you
in
a
black
satin.
Get
it
soon,
and
let
it
be
made
by
a
dressmaker
of
my
recommending.
Let
me
choose
the
pattern.
You
always
want
to
disguise
yourself
like
a
grandmother.
You
would
persuade
one
that
you
are
old
and
ugly.
Not
at
all!
On
the
contrary,
when
well
dressed
and
cheerful
you
are
very
comely
indeed;
your
smile
is
so
pleasant,
your
teeth
are
so
white,
your
hair
is
still
such
a
pretty
light
colour.
And
then
you
speak
like
a
young
lady,
with
such
a
clear,
fine
tone,
and
you
sing
better
than
any
young
lady
I
ever
heard.
Why
do
you
wear
such
dresses
and
bonnets,
mamma,
such
as
nobody
else
ever
wears?"
"Does
it
annoy
you,
Caroline?"
"Very
much;
it
vexes
me
even.
People
say
you
are
miserly;
and
yet
you
are
not,
for
you
give
liberally
to
the
poor
and
to
religious
societies
though
your
gifts
are
conveyed
so
secretly
and
quietly
that
they
are
known
to
few
except
the
receivers.
But
I
will
be
your
lady's
maid
myself.
When
I
get
a
little
stronger
I
will
set
to
work,
and
you
must
be
good,
mamma,
and
do
as
I
bid
you."
And
Caroline,
sitting
near
her
mother,
rearranged
her
muslin
handkerchief
and
resmoothed
her
hair.
"My
own
mamma,"
then
she
went
on,
as
if
pleasing
herself
with
the
thought
of
their
relationship,
"who
belongs
to
me,
and
to
whom
I
belong!
I
am
a
rich
girl
now.
I
have
something
I
can
love
well,
and
not
be
afraid
of
loving.
Mamma,
who
gave
you
this
little
brooch?
Let
me
unpin
it
and
look
at
it."
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
usually
shrank
from
meddling
fingers
and
near
approach,
allowed
the
license
complacently.
"Did
papa
give
you
this,
mamma?"
"My
sister
gave
it
me
my
only
sister,
Cary.
Would
that
your
Aunt
Caroline
had
lived
to
see
her
niece!"
"Have
you
nothing
of
papa's
no
trinket,
no
gift
of
his?"
"I
have
one
thing."
"That
you
prize?"
"That
I
prize."
"Valuable
and
pretty?"
"Invaluable
and
sweet
to
me."
"Show
it,
mamma.
Is
it
here
or
at
Fieldhead?"
"It
is
talking
to
me
now,
leaning
on
me.
Its
arms
are
round
me."
"Ah,
mamma,
you
mean
your
teasing
daughter,
who
will
never
let
you
alone;
who,
when
you
go
into
your
room,
cannot
help
running
to
seek
for
you;
who
follows
you
upstairs
and
down,
like
a
dog."
"Whose
features
still
give
me
such
a
strange
thrill
sometimes.
I
half
fear
your
fair
looks
yet,
child."
"You
don't;
you
can't.
Mamma,
I
am
sorry
papa
was
not
good.
I
do
so
wish
he
had
been.
Wickedness
spoils
and
poisons
all
pleasant
things.
It
kills
love.
If
you
and
I
thought
each
other
wicked,
we
could
not
love
each
other,
could
we?"
"And
if
we
could
not
trust
each
other,
Cary?"
"How
miserable
we
should
be!
Mother,
before
I
knew
you
I
had
an
apprehension
that
you
were
not
good
that
I
could
not
esteem
you.
That
dread
damped
my
wish
to
see
you.
And
now
my
heart
is
elate
because
I
find
you
perfect
almost;
kind,
clever,
nice.
Your
sole
fault
is
that
you
are
old
fashioned,
and
of
that
I
shall
cure
you.
Mamma,
put
your
work
down;
read
to
me.
I
like
your
southern
accent;
it
is
so
pure,
so
soft.
It
has
no
rugged
burr,
no
nasal
twang,
such
as
almost
every
one's
voice
here
in
the
north
has.
My
uncle
and
Mr.
Hall
say
that
you
are
a
fine
reader,
mamma.
Mr.
Hall
said
he
never
heard
any
lady
read
with
such
propriety
of
expression
or
purity
of
accent."
"I
wish
I
could
reciprocate
the
compliment,
Cary;
but,
really,
the
first
time
I
heard
your
truly
excellent
friend
read
and
preach
I
could
not
understand
his
broad
northern
tongue."
"Could
you
understand
me,
mamma?
Did
I
seem
to
speak
roughly?"
"No.
I
almost
wished
you
had,
as
I
wished
you
had
looked
unpolished.
Your
father,
Caroline,
naturally
spoke
well,
quite
otherwise
than
your
worthy
uncle
correctly,
gently,
smoothly.
You
inherit
the
gift."
"Poor
papa!
When
he
was
so
agreeable,
why
was
he
not
good?"
"Why
he
was
as
he
was
and
happily
of
that
you,
child,
can
form
no
conception
I
cannot
tell.
It
is
a
deep
mystery.
The
key
is
in
the
hands
of
his
Maker.
There
I
leave
it."
"Mamma,
you
will
keep
stitching,
stitching
away.
Put
down
the
sewing;
I
am
an
enemy
to
it.
It
cumbers
your
lap,
and
I
want
it
for
my
head;
it
engages
your
eyes,
and
I
want
them
for
a
book.
Here
is
your
favourite
Cowper."
These
importunities
were
the
mother's
pleasure.
If
ever
she
delayed
compliance,
it
was
only
to
hear
them
repeated,
and
to
enjoy
her
child's
soft,
half
playful,
half
petulant
urgency.
And
then,
when
she
yielded,
Caroline
would
say
archly,
"You
will
spoil
me,
mamma.
I
always
thought
I
should
like
to
be
spoiled,
and
I
find
it
very
sweet."
So
did
Mrs.
Pryor.
By
the
time
the
Fieldhead
party
returned
to
Briarfield
Caroline
was
nearly
well.
Miss
Keeldar,
who
had
received
news
by
post
of
her
friend's
convalescence,
hardly
suffered
an
hour
to
elapse
between
her
arrival
at
home
and
her
first
call
at
the
rectory.
A
shower
of
rain
was
falling
gently,
yet
fast,
on
the
late
flowers
and
russet
autumn
shrubs,
when
the
garden
wicket
was
heard
to
swing
open,
and
Shirley's
well
known
form
passed
the
window.
On
her
entrance
her
feelings
were
evinced
in
her
own
peculiar
fashion.
When
deeply
moved
by
serious
fears
or
joys
she
was
not
garrulous.
The
strong
emotion
was
rarely
suffered
to
influence
her
tongue,
and
even
her
eye
refused
it
more
than
a
furtive
and
fitful
conquest.
She
took
Caroline
in
her
arms,
gave
her
one
look,
one
kiss,
then
said,
"You
are
better."
And
a
minute
after,
"I
see
you
are
safe
now;
but
take
care.
God
grant
your
health
may
be
called
on
to
sustain
no
more
shocks!"
She
proceeded
to
talk
fluently
about
the
journey.
In
the
midst
of
vivacious
discourse
her
eye
still
wandered
to
Caroline.
There
spoke
in
its
light
a
deep
solicitude,
some
trouble,
and
some
amaze.
"She
may
be
better,"
it
said,
"but
how
weak
she
still
is!
What
peril
she
has
come
through!"
Suddenly
her
glance
reverted
to
Mrs.
Pryor.
It
pierced
her
through.
"When
will
my
governess
return
to
me?"
she
asked.
"May
I
tell
her
all?"
demanded
Caroline
of
her
mother.
Leave
being
signified
by
a
gesture,
Shirley
was
presently
enlightened
on
what
had
happened
in
her
absence.
"Very
good,"
was
the
cool
comment
"very
good!
But
it
is
no
news
to
me."
"What!
did
you
know?"
"I
guessed
long
since
the
whole
business.
I
have
heard
somewhat
of
Mrs.
Pryor's
history
not
from
herself,
but
from
others.
With
every
detail
of
Mr.
James
Helstone's
career
and
character
I
was
acquainted.
An
afternoon's
sitting
and
conversation
with
Miss
Mann
had
rendered
me
familiar
therewith;
also
he
is
one
of
Mrs.
Yorke's
warning
examples
one
of
the
blood
red
lights
she
hangs
out
to
scare
young
ladies
from
matrimony.
I
believe
I
should
have
been
sceptical
about
the
truth
of
the
portrait
traced
by
such
fingers
both
these
ladies
take
a
dark
pleasure
in
offering
to
view
the
dark
side
of
life
but
I
questioned
Mr.
Yorke
on
the
subject,
and
he
said,
'Shirley,
my
woman,
if
you
want
to
know
aught
about
yond'
James
Helstone,
I
can
only
say
he
was
a
man
tiger.
He
was
handsome,
dissolute,
soft,
treacherous,
courteous,
cruel
'
Don't
cry,
Cary;
we'll
say
no
more
about
it."
"I
am
not
crying,
Shirley;
or
if
I
am,
it
is
nothing.
Go
on;
you
are
no
friend
if
you
withhold
from
me
the
truth.
I
hate
that
false
plan
of
disguising,
mutilating
the
truth."
"Fortunately
I
have
said
pretty
nearly
all
that
I
have
to
say,
except
that
your
uncle
himself
confirmed
Mr.
Yorke's
words;
for
he
too
scorns
a
lie,
and
deals
in
none
of
those
conventional
subterfuges
that
are
shabbier
than
lies."
"But
papa
is
dead;
they
should
let
him
alone
now."
"They
should;
and
we
will
let
him
alone.
Cry
away,
Cary;
it
will
do
you
good.
It
is
wrong
to
check
natural
tears.
Besides,
I
choose
to
please
myself
by
sharing
an
idea
that
at
this
moment
beams
in
your
mother's
eye
while
she
looks
at
you.
Every
drop
blots
out
a
sin.
Weep!
your
tears
have
the
virtue
which
the
rivers
of
Damascus
lacked.
Like
Jordan,
they
can
cleanse
a
leprous
memory."
"Madam,"
she
continued,
addressing
Mrs.
Pryor,
"did
you
think
I
could
be
daily
in
the
habit
of
seeing
you
and
your
daughter
together
marking
your
marvellous
similarity
in
many
points,
observing
(pardon
me)
your
irrepressible
emotions
in
the
presence
and
still
more
in
the
absence
of
your
child
and
not
form
my
own
conjectures?
I
formed
them,
and
they
are
literally
correct.
I
shall
begin
to
think
myself
shrewd."
"And
you
said
nothing?"
observed
Caroline,
who
soon
regained
the
quiet
control
of
her
feelings.
"Nothing.
I
had
no
warrant
to
breathe
a
word
on
the
subject.
My
business
it
was
not;
I
abstained
from
making
it
such."
"You
guessed
so
deep
a
secret,
and
did
not
hint
that
you
guessed
it?"
"Is
that
so
difficult?"
"It
is
not
like
you."
"How
do
you
know?"
"You
are
not
reserved;
you
are
frankly
communicative."
"I
may
be
communicative,
yet
know
where
to
stop.
In
showing
my
treasure
I
may
withhold
a
gem
or
two
a
curious,
unbought
graven
stone
an
amulet
of
whose
mystic
glitter
I
rarely
permit
even
myself
a
glimpse.
Good
day."
Caroline
thus
seemed
to
get
a
view
of
Shirley's
character
under
a
novel
aspect.
Ere
long
the
prospect
was
renewed;
it
opened
upon
her.
No
sooner
had
she
regained
sufficient
strength
to
bear
a
change
of
scene
the
excitement
of
a
little
society
than
Miss
Keeldar
sued
daily
for
her
presence
at
Fieldhead.
Whether
Shirley
had
become
wearied
of
her
honoured
relatives
is
not
known.
She
did
not
say
she
was;
but
she
claimed
and
retained
Caroline
with
an
eagerness
which
proved
that
an
addition
to
that
worshipful
company
was
not
unwelcome.
The
Sympsons
were
church
people.
Of
course
the
rector's
niece
was
received
by
them
with
courtesy.
Mr.
Sympson
proved
to
be
a
man
of
spotless
respectability,
worrying
temper,
pious
principles,
and
worldly
views;
his
lady
was
a
very
good
woman
patient,
kind,
well
bred.
She
had
been
brought
up
on
a
narrow
system
of
views,
starved
on
a
few
prejudices
a
mere
handful
of
bitter
herbs;
a
few
preferences,
soaked
till
their
natural
flavour
was
extracted,
and
with
no
seasoning
added
in
the
cooking;
some
excellent
principles,
made
up
in
a
stiff
raised
crust
of
bigotry
difficult
to
digest.
Far
too
submissive
was
she
to
complain
of
this
diet
or
to
ask
for
a
crumb
beyond
it.
The
daughters
were
an
example
to
their
sex.
They
were
tall,
with
a
Roman
nose
apiece.
They
had
been
educated
faultlessly.
All
they
did
was
well
done.
History
and
the
most
solid
books
had
cultivated
their
minds.
Principles
and
opinions
they
possessed
which
could
not
be
mended.
More
exactly
regulated
lives,
feelings,
manners,
habits,
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
anywhere.
They
knew
by
heart
a
certain
young
ladies'
schoolroom
code
of
laws
on
language,
demeanour,
etc.;
themselves
never
deviated
from
its
curious
little
pragmatical
provisions,
and
they
regarded
with
secret
whispered
horror
all
deviations
in
others.
The
Abomination
of
Desolation
was
no
mystery
to
them;
they
had
discovered
that
unutterable
Thing
in
the
characteristic
others
call
Originality.
Quick
were
they
to
recognize
the
signs
of
this
evil;
and
wherever
they
saw
its
trace
whether
in
look,
word,
or
deed;
whether
they
read
it
in
the
fresh,
vigorous
style
of
a
book,
or
listened
to
it
in
interesting,
unhackneyed,
pure,
expressive
language
they
shuddered,
they
recoiled.
Danger
was
above
their
heads,
peril
about
their
steps.
What
was
this
strange
thing?
Being
unintelligible
it
must
be
bad.
Let
it
be
denounced
and
chained
up.
Henry
Sympson,
the
only
son
and
youngest
child
of
the
family,
was
a
boy
of
fifteen.
He
generally
kept
with
his
tutor.
When
he
left
him,
he
sought
his
cousin
Shirley.
This
boy
differed
from
his
sisters.
He
was
little,
lame,
and
pale;
his
large
eyes
shone
somewhat
languidly
in
a
wan
orbit.
They
were,
indeed,
usually
rather
dim,
but
they
were
capable
of
illumination.
At
times
they
could
not
only
shine,
but
blaze.
Inward
emotion
could
likewise
give
colour
to
his
cheek
and
decision
to
his
crippled
movements.
Henry's
mother
loved
him;
she
thought
his
peculiarities
were
a
mark
of
election.
He
was
not
like
other
children,
she
allowed.
She
believed
him
regenerate
a
new
Samuel
called
of
God
from
his
birth.
He
was
to
be
a
clergyman.
Mr.
and
the
Misses
Sympson,
not
understanding
the
youth,
let
him
much
alone.
Shirley
made
him
her
pet,
and
he
made
Shirley
his
playmate.
In
the
midst
of
this
family
circle,
or
rather
outside
it,
moved
the
tutor
the
satellite.
Yes,
Louis
Moore
was
a
satellite
of
the
house
of
Sympson
connected,
yet
apart;
ever
attendant,
ever
distant.
Each
member
of
that
correct
family
treated
him
with
proper
dignity.
The
father
was
austerely
civil,
sometimes
irritable;
the
mother,
being
a
kind
woman,
was
attentive,
but
formal;
the
daughters
saw
in
him
an
abstraction,
not
a
man.
It
seemed,
by
their
manner,
that
their
brother's
tutor
did
not
live
for
them.
They
were
learned;
so
was
he
but
not
for
them.
They
were
accomplished;
he
had
talents
too,
imperceptible
to
their
senses.
The
most
spirited
sketch
from
his
fingers
was
a
blank
to
their
eyes;
the
most
original
observation
from
his
lips
fell
unheard
on
their
ears.
Nothing
could
exceed
the
propriety
of
their
behaviour.
I
should
have
said
nothing
could
have
equalled
it;
but
I
remember
a
fact
which
strangely
astonished
Caroline
Helstone.
It
was
to
discover
that
her
cousin
had
absolutely
no
sympathizing
friend
at
Fieldhead;
that
to
Miss
Keeldar
he
was
as
much
a
mere
teacher,
as
little
a
gentleman,
as
little
a
man,
as
to
the
estimable
Misses
Sympson.
What
had
befallen
the
kind
hearted
Shirley
that
she
should
be
so
indifferent
to
the
dreary
position
of
a
fellow
creature
thus
isolated
under
her
roof?
She
was
not,
perhaps,
haughty
to
him,
but
she
never
noticed
him
she
let
him
alone.
He
came
and
went,
spoke
or
was
silent,
and
she
rarely
recognized
his
existence.
As
to
Louis
Moore
himself,
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
used
to
this
life,
and
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
bear
it
for
a
time.
His
faculties
seemed
walled
up
in
him,
and
were
unmurmuring
in
their
captivity.
He
never
laughed;
he
seldom
smiled;
he
was
uncomplaining.
He
fulfilled
the
round
of
his
duties
scrupulously.
His
pupil
loved
him;
he
asked
nothing
more
than
civility
from
the
rest
of
the
world.
It
even
appeared
that
he
would
accept
nothing
more
in
that
abode
at
least;
for
when
his
cousin
Caroline
made
gentle
overtures
of
friendship,
he
did
not
encourage
them
he
rather
avoided
than
sought
her.
One
living
thing
alone,
besides
his
pale,
crippled
scholar,
he
fondled
in
the
house,
and
that
was
the
ruffianly
Tartar,
who,
sullen
and
impracticable
to
others,
acquired
a
singular
partiality
for
him
a
partiality
so
marked
that
sometimes,
when
Moore,
summoned
to
a
meal,
entered
the
room
and
sat
down
unwelcomed,
Tartar
would
rise
from
his
lair
at
Shirley's
feet
and
betake
himself
to
the
taciturn
tutor.
Once
but
once
she
noticed
the
desertion,
and
holding
out
her
white
hand,
and
speaking
softly,
tried
to
coax
him
back.
Tartar
looked,
slavered,
and
sighed,
as
his
manner
was,
but
yet
disregarded
the
invitation,
and
coolly
settled
himself
on
his
haunches
at
Louis
Moore's
side.
That
gentleman
drew
the
dog's
big,
black
muzzled
head
on
to
his
knee,
patted
him,
and
smiled
one
little
smile
to
himself.
An
acute
observer
might
have
remarked,
in
the
course
of
the
same
evening,
that
after
Tartar
had
resumed
his
allegiance
to
Shirley,
and
was
once
more
couched
near
her
footstool,
the
audacious
tutor
by
one
word
and
gesture
fascinated
him
again.
He
pricked
up
his
ears
at
the
word;
he
started
erect
at
the
gesture,
and
came,
with
head
lovingly
depressed,
to
receive
the
expected
caress.
As
it
was
given,
the
significant
smile
again
rippled
across
Moore's
quiet
face.
"Shirley,"
said
Caroline
one
day,
as
they
two
were
sitting
alone
in
the
summer
house,
"did
you
know
that
my
cousin
Louis
was
tutor
in
your
uncle's
family
before
the
Sympsons
came
down
here?"
Shirley's
reply
was
not
so
prompt
as
her
responses
usually
were,
but
at
last
she
answered,
"Yes
of
course;
I
knew
it
well."
"I
thought
you
must
have
been
aware
of
the
circumstance."
"Well!
what
then?"
"It
puzzles
me
to
guess
how
it
chanced
that
you
never
mentioned
it
to
me."
"Why
should
it
puzzle
you?"
"It
seems
odd.
I
cannot
account
for
it.
You
talk
a
great
deal
you
talk
freely.
How
was
that
circumstance
never
touched
on?"
"Because
it
never
was,"
and
Shirley
laughed.
"You
are
a
singular
being!"
observed
her
friend.
"I
thought
I
knew
you
quite
well;
I
begin
to
find
myself
mistaken.
You
were
silent
as
the
grave
about
Mrs.
Pryor,
and
now
again
here
is
another
secret.
But
why
you
made
it
a
secret
is
the
mystery
to
me."
"I
never
made
it
a
secret;
I
had
no
reason
for
so
doing.
If
you
had
asked
me
who
Henry's
tutor
was,
I
would
have
told
you.
Besides,
I
thought
you
knew."
"I
am
puzzled
about
more
things
than
one
in
this
matter.
You
don't
like
poor
Louis.
Why?
Are
you
impatient
at
what
you
perhaps
consider
his
servile
position?
Do
you
wish
that
Robert's
brother
were
more
highly
placed?"
"Robert's
brother,
indeed!"
was
the
exclamation,
uttered
in
a
tone
like
the
accents
of
scorn;
and
with
a
movement
of
proud
impatience
Shirley
snatched
a
rose
from
a
branch
peeping
through
the
open
lattice.
"Yes,"
repeated
Caroline,
with
mild
firmness,
"Robert's
brother.
He
is
thus
closely
related
to
Gerard
Moore
of
the
Hollow,
though
nature
has
not
given
him
features
so
handsome
or
an
air
so
noble
as
his
kinsman;
but
his
blood
is
as
good,
and
he
is
as
much
a
gentleman
were
he
free."
"Wise,
humble,
pious
Caroline!"
exclaimed
Shirley
ironically.
"Men
and
angels,
hear
her!
We
should
not
despise
plain
features,
nor
a
laborious
yet
honest
occupation,
should
we?
Look
at
the
subject
of
your
panegyric.
He
is
there
in
the
garden,"
she
continued,
pointing
through
an
aperture
in
the
clustering
creepers;
and
by
that
aperture
Louis
Moore
was
visible,
coming
slowly
down
the
walk.
"He
is
not
ugly,
Shirley,"
pleaded
Caroline;
"he
is
not
ignoble.
He
is
sad;
silence
seals
his
mind.
But
I
believe
him
to
be
intelligent;
and
be
certain,
if
he
had
not
something
very
commendable
in
his
disposition,
Mr.
Hall
would
never
seek
his
society
as
he
does."
Shirley
laughed;
she
laughed
again,
each
time
with
a
slightly
sarcastic
sound.
"Well,
well,"
was
her
comment.
"On
the
plea
of
the
man
being
Cyril
Hall's
friend
and
Robert
Moore's
brother,
we'll
just
tolerate
his
existence;
won't
we,
Cary?
You
believe
him
to
be
intelligent,
do
you?
Not
quite
an
idiot
eh?
Something
commendable
in
his
disposition!
id
est,
not
an
absolute
ruffian.
Good!
Your
representations
have
weight
with
me;
and
to
prove
that
they
have,
should
he
come
this
way
I
will
speak
to
him."
He
approached
the
summer
house.
Unconscious
that
it
was
tenanted,
he
sat
down
on
the
step.
Tartar,
now
his
customary
companion,
had
followed
him,
and
he
couched
across
his
feet.
"Old
boy!"
said
Louis,
pulling
his
tawny
ear,
or
rather
the
mutilated
remains
of
that
organ,
torn
and
chewed
in
a
hundred
battles,
"the
autumn
sun
shines
as
pleasantly
on
us
as
on
the
fairest
and
richest.
This
garden
is
none
of
ours,
but
we
enjoy
its
greenness
and
perfume,
don't
we?"
He
sat
silent,
still
caressing
Tartar,
who
slobbered
with
exceeding
affection.
A
faint
twittering
commenced
among
the
trees
round.
Something
fluttered
down
as
light
as
leaves.
They
were
little
birds,
which,
lighting
on
the
sward
at
shy
distance,
hopped
as
if
expectant.
"The
small
brown
elves
actually
remember
that
I
fed
them
the
other
day,"
again
soliloquized
Louis.
"They
want
some
more
biscuit.
To
day
I
forgot
to
save
a
fragment.
Eager
little
sprites,
I
have
not
a
crumb
for
you."
He
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
drew
it
out
empty.
"A
want
easily
supplied,"
whispered
the
listening
Miss
Keeldar.
She
took
from
her
reticule
a
morsel
of
sweet
cake;
for
that
repository
was
never
destitute
of
something
available
to
throw
to
the
chickens,
young
ducks,
or
sparrows.
She
crumbled
it,
and
bending
over
his
shoulder,
put
the
crumbs
into
his
hand.
"There,"
said
she
"there
is
a
providence
for
the
improvident."
"This
September
afternoon
is
pleasant,"
observed
Louis
Moore,
as,
not
at
all
discomposed,
he
calmly
cast
the
crumbs
on
to
the
grass.
"Even
for
you?"
"As
pleasant
for
me
as
for
any
monarch."
"You
take
a
sort
of
harsh,
solitary
triumph
in
drawing
pleasure
out
of
the
elements
and
the
inanimate
and
lower
animate
creation."
"Solitary,
but
not
harsh.
With
animals
I
feel
I
am
Adam's
son,
the
heir
of
him
to
whom
dominion
was
given
over
'every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth.'
Your
dog
likes
and
follows
me.
When
I
go
into
that
yard,
the
pigeons
from
your
dovecot
flutter
at
my
feet.
Your
mare
in
the
stable
knows
me
as
well
as
it
knows
you,
and
obeys
me
better."
"And
my
roses
smell
sweet
to
you,
and
my
trees
give
you
shade."
"And,"
continued
Louis,
"no
caprice
can
withdraw
these
pleasures
from
me;
they
are
mine."
He
walked
off.
Tartar
followed
him,
as
if
in
duty
and
affection
bound,
and
Shirley
remained
standing
on
the
summer
house
step.
Caroline
saw
her
face
as
she
looked
after
the
rude
tutor.
It
was
pale,
as
if
her
pride
bled
inwardly.
"You
see,"
remarked
Caroline
apologetically,
"his
feelings
are
so
often
hurt
it
makes
him
morose."
"You
see,"
retorted
Shirley,
with
ire,
"he
is
a
topic
on
which
you
and
I
shall
quarrel
if
we
discuss
it
often;
so
drop
it
henceforward
and
for
ever."
"I
suppose
he
has
more
than
once
behaved
in
this
way,"
thought
Caroline
to
herself,
"and
that
renders
Shirley
so
distant
to
him.
Yet
I
wonder
she
cannot
make
allowance
for
character
and
circumstances.
I
wonder
the
general
modesty,
manliness,
sincerity
of
his
nature
do
not
plead
with
her
in
his
behalf.
She
is
not
often
so
inconsiderate,
so
irritable."
The
verbal
testimony
of
two
friends
of
Caroline's
to
her
cousin's
character
augmented
her
favourable
opinion
of
him.
William
Farren,
whose
cottage
he
had
visited
in
company
with
Mr.
Hall,
pronounced
him
a
"real
gentleman;"
there
was
not
such
another
in
Briarfield.
He
William
"could
do
aught
for
that
man.
And
then
to
see
how
t'
bairns
liked
him,
and
how
t'
wife
took
to
him
first
minute
she
saw
him.
He
never
went
into
a
house
but
t'
childer
wor
about
him
directly.
Them
little
things
wor
like
as
if
they'd
a
keener
sense
nor
grown
up
folks
i'
finding
our
folk's
natures."
Mr.
Hall,
in
answer
to
a
question
of
Miss
Helstone's
as
to
what
he
thought
of
Louis
Moore,
replied
promptly
that
he
was
the
best
fellow
he
had
met
with
since
he
left
Cambridge.
"But
he
is
so
grave,"
objected
Caroline.
"Grave!
the
finest
company
in
the
world!
Full
of
odd,
quiet,
out
of
the
way
humour.
Never
enjoyed
an
excursion
so
much
in
my
life
as
the
one
I
took
with
him
to
the
Lakes.
His
understanding
and
tastes
are
so
superior,
it
does
a
man
good
to
be
within
their
influence;
and
as
to
his
temper
and
nature,
I
call
them
fine."
"At
Fieldhead
he
looks
gloomy,
and,
I
believe,
has
the
character
of
being
misanthropical."
"Oh!
I
fancy
he
is
rather
out
of
place
there
in
a
false
position.
The
Sympsons
are
most
estimable
people,
but
not
the
folks
to
comprehend
him.
They
think
a
great
deal
about
form
and
ceremony,
which
are
quite
out
of
Louis's
way."
"I
don't
think
Miss
Keeldar
likes
him."
"She
doesn't
know
him
she
doesn't
know
him;
otherwise
she
has
sense
enough
to
do
justice
to
his
merits."
"Well,
I
suppose
she
doesn't
know
him,"
mused
Caroline
to
herself,
and
by
this
hypothesis
she
endeavoured
to
account
for
what
seemed
else
unaccountable.
But
such
simple
solution
of
the
difficulty
was
not
left
her
long.
She
was
obliged
to
refuse
Miss
Keeldar
even
this
negative
excuse
for
her
prejudice.
One
day
she
chanced
to
be
in
the
schoolroom
with
Henry
Sympson,
whose
amiable
and
affectionate
disposition
had
quickly
recommended
him
to
her
regard.
The
boy
was
busied
about
some
mechanical
contrivance;
his
lameness
made
him
fond
of
sedentary
occupation.
He
began
to
ransack
his
tutor's
desk
for
a
piece
of
wax
or
twine
necessary
to
his
work.
Moore
happened
to
be
absent.
Mr.
Hall,
indeed,
had
called
for
him
to
take
a
long
walk.
Henry
could
not
immediately
find
the
object
of
his
search.
He
rummaged
compartment
after
compartment;
and
at
last,
opening
an
inner
drawer,
he
came
upon
not
a
ball
of
cord
or
a
lump
of
beeswax,
but
a
little
bundle
of
small
marble
coloured
cahiers,
tied
with
tape.
Henry
looked
at
them.
"What
rubbish
Mr.
Moore
stores
up
in
his
desk!"
he
said.
"I
hope
he
won't
keep
my
old
exercises
so
carefully."
"What
is
it?"
"Old
copy
books."
He
threw
the
bundle
to
Caroline.
The
packet
looked
so
neat
externally
her
curiosity
was
excited
to
see
its
contents.
"If
they
are
only
copy
books,
I
suppose
I
may
open
them?"
"Oh
yes,
quite
freely.
Mr.
Moore's
desk
is
half
mine
for
he
lets
me
keep
all
sorts
of
things
in
it
and
I
give
you
leave."
On
scrutiny
they
proved
to
be
French
compositions,
written
in
a
hand
peculiar
but
compact,
and
exquisitely
clean
and
clear.
The
writing
was
recognizable.
She
scarcely
needed
the
further
evidence
of
the
name
signed
at
the
close
of
each
theme
to
tell
her
whose
they
were.
Yet
that
name
astonished
her
"Shirley
Keeldar,
Sympson
Grove,
shire"
(a
southern
county),
and
a
date
four
years
back.
She
tied
up
the
packet,
and
held
it
in
her
hand,
meditating
over
it.
She
half
felt
as
if,
in
opening
it,
she
had
violated
a
confidence.
"They
are
Shirley's,
you
see,"
said
Henry
carelessly.
"Did
you
give
them
to
Mr.
Moore?
She
wrote
them
with
Mrs.
Pryor,
I
suppose?"
"She
wrote
them
in
my
schoolroom
at
Sympson
Grove,
when
she
lived
with
us
there.
Mr.
Moore
taught
her
French;
it
is
his
native
language."
"I
know.
Was
she
a
good
pupil,
Henry?"
"She
was
a
wild,
laughing
thing,
but
pleasant
to
have
in
the
room.
She
made
lesson
time
charming.
She
learned
fast
you
could
hardly
tell
when
or
how.
French
was
nothing
to
her.
She
spoke
it
quick,
quick
as
quick
as
Mr.
Moore
himself."
"Was
she
obedient?
Did
she
give
trouble?"
"She
gave
plenty
of
trouble,
in
a
way.
She
was
giddy,
but
I
liked
her.
I'm
desperately
fond
of
Shirley."
"Desperately
fond
you
small
simpleton!
You
don't
know
what
you
say."
"I
am
desperately
fond
of
her.
She
is
the
light
of
my
eyes.
I
said
so
to
Mr.
Moore
last
night."
"He
would
reprove
you
for
speaking
with
exaggeration."
"He
didn't.
He
never
reproves
and
reproves,
as
girls'
governesses
do.
He
was
reading,
and
he
only
smiled
into
his
book,
and
said
that
if
Miss
Keeldar
was
no
more
than
that,
she
was
less
than
he
took
her
to
be;
for
I
was
but
a
dim
eyed,
short
sighted
little
chap.
I'm
afraid
I
am
a
poor
unfortunate,
Miss
Caroline
Helstone.
I
am
a
cripple,
you
know."
"Never
mind,
Henry,
you
are
a
very
nice
little
fellow;
and
if
God
has
not
given
you
health
and
strength,
He
has
given
you
a
good
disposition
and
an
excellent
heart
and
brain."
"I
shall
be
despised.
I
sometimes
think
both
Shirley
and
you
despise
me."
"Listen,
Henry.
Generally,
I
don't
like
schoolboys.
I
have
a
great
horror
of
them.
They
seem
to
me
little
ruffians,
who
take
an
unnatural
delight
in
killing
and
tormenting
birds,
and
insects,
and
kittens,
and
whatever
is
weaker
than
themselves.
But
you
are
so
different
I
am
quite
fond
of
you.
You
have
almost
as
much
sense
as
a
man
(far
more,
God
wot,"
she
muttered
to
herself,
"than
many
men);
you
are
fond
of
reading,
and
you
can
talk
sensibly
about
what
you
read."
"I
am
fond
of
reading.
I
know
I
have
sense,
and
I
know
I
have
feeling."
Miss
Keeldar
here
entered.
"Henry,"
she
said,
"I
have
brought
your
lunch
here.
I
shall
prepare
it
for
you
myself."
She
placed
on
the
table
a
glass
of
new
milk,
a
plate
of
something
which
looked
not
unlike
leather,
and
a
utensil
which
resembled
a
toasting
fork.
"What
are
you
two
about,"
she
continued,
"ransacking
Mr.
Moore's
desk?"
"Looking
at
your
old
copy
books,"
returned
Caroline.
"My
old
copy
books?"
"French
exercise
books.
Look
here!
They
must
be
held
precious;
they
are
kept
carefully."
She
showed
the
bundle.
Shirley
snatched
it
up.
"Did
not
know
one
was
in
existence,"
she
said.
"I
thought
the
whole
lot
had
long
since
lit
the
kitchen
fire,
or
curled
the
maid's
hair
at
Sympson
Grove.
What
made
you
keep
them,
Henry?"
"It
is
not
my
doing.
I
should
not
have
thought
of
it.
It
never
entered
my
head
to
suppose
copy
books
of
value.
Mr.
Moore
put
them
by
in
the
inner
drawer
of
his
desk.
Perhaps
he
forgot
them."
"C'est
cela.
He
forgot
them,
no
doubt,"
echoed
Shirley.
"They
are
extremely
well
written,"
she
observed
complacently.
"What
a
giddy
girl
you
were,
Shirley,
in
those
days!
I
remember
you
so
well.
A
slim,
light
creature
whom,
though
you
were
so
tall,
I
could
lift
off
the
floor.
I
see
you
with
your
long,
countless
curls
on
your
shoulders,
and
your
streaming
sash.
You
used
to
make
Mr.
Moore
lively
that
is,
at
first.
I
believe
you
grieved
him
after
a
while."
Shirley
turned
the
closely
written
pages
and
said
nothing.
Presently
she
observed,
"That
was
written
one
winter
afternoon.
It
was
a
description
of
a
snow
scene."
"I
remember,"
said
Henry.
"Mr.
Moore,
when
he
read
it,
cried,
'Voila
le
Francais
gagne!'
He
said
it
was
well
done.
Afterwards
you
made
him
draw,
in
sepia,
the
landscape
you
described."
"You
have
not
forgotten,
then,
Hal?"
"Not
at
all.
We
were
all
scolded
that
day
for
not
coming
down
to
tea
when
called.
I
can
remember
my
tutor
sitting
at
his
easel,
and
you
standing
behind
him,
holding
the
candle,
and
watching
him
draw
the
snowy
cliff,
the
pine,
the
deer
couched
under
it,
and
the
half
moon
hung
above."
"Where
are
his
drawings,
Harry?
Caroline
should
see
them."
"In
his
portfolio.
But
it
is
padlocked;
he
has
the
key."
"Ask
him
for
it
when
he
comes
in."
"You
should
ask
him,
Shirley.
You
are
shy
of
him
now.
You
are
grown
a
proud
lady
to
him;
I
notice
that."
"Shirley,
you
are
a
real
enigma,"
whispered
Caroline
in
her
ear.
"What
queer
discoveries
I
make
day
by
day
now!
I
who
thought
I
had
your
confidence.
Inexplicable
creature!
even
this
boy
reproves
you."
"I
have
forgotten
'auld
lang
syne,'
you
see,
Harry,"
said
Miss
Keeldar,
answering
young
Sympson,
and
not
heeding
Caroline.
"Which
you
never
should
have
done.
You
don't
deserve
to
be
a
man's
morning
star
if
you
have
so
short
a
memory."
"A
man's
morning
star,
indeed!
and
by
'a
man'
is
meant
your
worshipful
self,
I
suppose?
Come,
drink
your
new
milk
while
it
is
warm."
The
young
cripple
rose
and
limped
towards
the
fire;
he
had
left
his
crutch
near
the
mantelpiece.
"My
poor
lame
darling!"
murmured
Shirley,
in
her
softest
voice,
aiding
him.
"Whether
do
you
like
me
or
Mr.
Sam
Wynne
best,
Shirley?"
inquired
the
boy,
as
she
settled
him
in
an
arm
chair.
"O
Harry,
Sam
Wynne
is
my
aversion;
you
are
my
pet."
"Me
or
Mr.
Malone?"
"You
again,
a
thousand
times."
"Yet
they
are
great
whiskered
fellows,
six
feet
high
each."
"Whereas,
as
long
as
you
live,
Harry,
you
will
never
be
anything
more
than
a
little
pale
lameter."
"Yes,
I
know."
"You
need
not
be
sorrowful.
Have
I
not
often
told
you
who
was
almost
as
little,
as
pale,
as
suffering
as
you,
and
yet
potent
as
a
giant
and
brave
as
a
lion?"
"Admiral
Horatio?"
"Admiral
Horatio,
Viscount
Nelson,
and
Duke
of
Bronte;
great
at
heart
as
a
Titan;
gallant
and
heroic
as
all
the
world
and
age
of
chivalry;
leader
of
the
might
of
England;
commander
of
her
strength
on
the
deep;
hurler
of
her
thunder
over
the
flood."
"A
great
man.
But
I
am
not
warlike,
Shirley;
and
yet
my
mind
is
so
restless
I
burn
day
and
night
for
what
I
can
hardly
tell
to
be
to
do
to
suffer,
I
think."
"Harry,
it
is
your
mind,
which
is
stronger
and
older
than
your
frame,
that
troubles
you.
It
is
a
captive;
it
lies
in
physical
bondage.
But
it
will
work
its
own
redemption
yet.
Study
carefully
not
only
books
but
the
world.
You
love
nature;
love
her
without
fear.
Be
patient
wait
the
course
of
time.
You
will
not
be
a
soldier
or
a
sailor,
Henry;
but
if
you
live
you
will
be
listen
to
my
prophecy
you
will
be
an
author,
perhaps
a
poet."
"An
author!
It
is
a
flash
a
flash
of
light
to
me!
I
will
I
will!
I'll
write
a
book
that
I
may
dedicate
it
to
you."
"You
will
write
it
that
you
may
give
your
soul
its
natural
release.
Bless
me!
what
am
I
saying?
more
than
I
understand,
I
believe,
or
can
make
good.
Here,
Hal
here
is
your
toasted
oatcake;
eat
and
live!"
"Willingly!"
here
cried
a
voice
outside
the
open
window.
"I
know
that
fragrance
of
meal
bread.
Miss
Keeldar,
may
I
come
in
and
partake?"
"Mr.
Hall"
it
was
Mr.
Hall,
and
with
him
was
Louis
Moore,
returned
from
their
walk
"there
is
a
proper
luncheon
laid
out
in
the
dining
room
and
there
are
proper
people
seated
round
it.
You
may
join
that
society
and
share
that
fare
if
you
please;
but
if
your
ill
regulated
tastes
lead
you
to
prefer
ill
regulated
proceedings,
step
in
here,
and
do
as
we
do."
"I
approve
the
perfume,
and
therefore
shall
suffer
myself
to
be
led
by
the
nose,"
returned
Mr.
Hall,
who
presently
entered,
accompanied
by
Louis
Moore.
That
gentleman's
eye
fell
on
his
desk,
pillaged.
"Burglars!"
said
he.
"Henry,
you
merit
the
ferule."
"Give
it
to
Shirley
and
Caroline;
they
did
it,"
was
alleged,
with
more
attention
to
effect
than
truth.
"Traitor
and
false
witness!"
cried
both
the
girls.
"We
never
laid
hands
on
a
thing,
except
in
the
spirit
of
laudable
inquiry!"
"Exactly
so,"
said
Moore,
with
his
rare
smile.
"And
what
have
you
ferreted
out,
in
your
'spirit
of
laudable
inquiry'?"
He
perceived
the
inner
drawer
open.
"This
is
empty,"
said
he.
"Who
has
taken
"
"Here,
here!"
Caroline
hastened
to
say,
and
she
restored
the
little
packet
to
its
place.
He
shut
it
up;
he
locked
it
in
with
a
small
key
attached
to
his
watch
guard;
he
restored
the
other
papers
to
order,
closed
the
repository,
and
sat
down
without
further
remark.
"I
thought
you
would
have
scolded
much
more,
sir,"
said
Henry.
"The
girls
deserve
reprimand."
"I
leave
them
to
their
own
consciences."
"It
accuses
them
of
crimes
intended
as
well
as
perpetrated,
sir.
If
I
had
not
been
here,
they
would
have
treated
your
portfolio
as
they
have
done
your
desk;
but
I
told
them
it
was
padlocked."
"And
will
you
have
lunch
with
us?"
here
interposed
Shirley,
addressing
Moore,
and
desirous,
as
it
seemed,
to
turn
the
conversation.
"Certainly,
if
I
may."
"You
will
be
restricted
to
new
milk
and
Yorkshire
oatcake."
"Va
pour
le
lait
frais!"
said
Louis.
"But
for
your
oatcake!"
and
he
made
a
grimace.
"He
cannot
eat
it,"
said
Henry.
"He
thinks
it
is
like
bran,
raised
with
sour
yeast."
"Come,
then;
by
special
dispensation
we
will
allow
him
a
few
cracknels,
but
nothing
less
homely."
The
hostess
rang
the
bell
and
gave
her
frugal
orders,
which
were
presently
executed.
She
herself
measured
out
the
milk,
and
distributed
the
bread
round
the
cosy
circle
now
enclosing
the
bright
little
schoolroom
fire.
She
then
took
the
post
of
toaster
general;
and
kneeling
on
the
rug,
fork
in
hand,
fulfilled
her
office
with
dexterity.
Mr.
Hall,
who
relished
any
homely
innovation
on
ordinary
usages,
and
to
whom
the
husky
oatcake
was
from
custom
suave
as
manna,
seemed
in
his
best
spirits.
He
talked
and
laughed
gleefully
now
with
Caroline,
whom
he
had
fixed
by
his
side,
now
with
Shirley,
and
again
with
Louis
Moore.
And
Louis
met
him
in
congenial
spirit.
He
did
not
laugh
much,
but
he
uttered
in
the
quietest
tone
the
wittiest
things.
Gravely
spoken
sentences,
marked
by
unexpected
turns
and
a
quite
fresh
flavour
and
poignancy,
fell
easily
from
his
lips.
He
proved
himself
to
be
what
Mr.
Hall
had
said
he
was
excellent
company.
Caroline
marvelled
at
his
humour,
but
still
more
at
his
entire
self
possession.
Nobody
there
present
seemed
to
impose
on
him
a
sensation
of
unpleasant
restraint.
Nobody
seemed
a
bore
a
check
a
chill
to
him;
and
yet
there
was
the
cool
and
lofty
Miss
Keeldar
kneeling
before
the
fire,
almost
at
his
feet.
But
Shirley
was
cool
and
lofty
no
longer,
at
least
not
at
this
moment.
She
appeared
unconscious
of
the
humility
of
her
present
position;
or
if
conscious,
it
was
only
to
taste
a
charm
in
its
lowliness.
It
did
not
revolt
her
pride
that
the
group
to
whom
she
voluntarily
officiated
as
handmaid
should
include
her
cousin's
tutor.
It
did
not
scare
her
that
while
she
handed
the
bread
and
milk
to
the
rest,
she
had
to
offer
it
to
him
also;
and
Moore
took
his
portion
from
her
hand
as
calmly
as
if
he
had
been
her
equal.
"You
are
overheated
now,"
he
said,
when
she
had
retained
the
fork
for
some
time;
"let
me
relieve
you."
And
he
took
it
from
her
with
a
sort
of
quiet
authority,
to
which
she
submitted
passively,
neither
resisting
him
nor
thanking
him.
"I
should
like
to
see
your
pictures,
Louis,"
said
Caroline,
when
the
sumptuous
luncheon
was
discussed.
"Would
not
you,
Mr.
Hall?"
"To
please
you,
I
should;
but,
for
my
own
part,
I
have
cut
him
as
an
artist.
I
had
enough
of
him
in
that
capacity
in
Cumberland
and
Westmoreland.
Many
a
wetting
we
got
amongst
the
mountains
because
he
would
persist
in
sitting
on
a
camp
stool,
catching
effects
of
rain
clouds,
gathering
mists,
fitful
sunbeams,
and
what
not."
"Here
is
the
portfolio,"
said
Henry,
bringing
it
in
one
hand
and
leaning
on
his
crutch
with
the
other.
Louis
took
it,
but
he
still
sat
as
if
he
wanted
another
to
speak.
It
seemed
as
if
he
would
not
open
it
unless
the
proud
Shirley
deigned
to
show
herself
interested
in
the
exhibition.
"He
makes
us
wait
to
whet
our
curiosity,"
she
said.
"You
understand
opening
it,"
observed
Louis,
giving
her
the
key.
"You
spoiled
the
lock
for
me
once;
try
now."
He
held
it.
She
opened
it,
and,
monopolizing
the
contents,
had
the
first
view
of
every
sketch
herself.
She
enjoyed
the
treat
if
treat
it
were
in
silence,
without
a
single
comment.
Moore
stood
behind
her
chair
and
looked
over
her
shoulder,
and
when
she
had
done
and
the
others
were
still
gazing,
he
left
his
post
and
paced
through
the
room.
A
carriage
was
heard
in
the
lane
the
gate
bell
rang.
Shirley
started.
"There
are
callers,"
she
said,
"and
I
shall
be
summoned
to
the
room.
A
pretty
figure
as
they
say
I
am
to
receive
company.
I
and
Henry
have
been
in
the
garden
gathering
fruit
half
the
morning.
Oh
for
rest
under
my
own
vine
and
my
own
fig
tree!
Happy
is
the
slave
wife
of
the
Indian
chief,
in
that
she
has
no
drawing
room
duty
to
perform,
but
can
sit
at
ease
weaving
mats,
and
stringing
beads,
and
peacefully
flattening
her
pickaninny's
head
in
an
unmolested
corner
of
her
wigwam.
I'll
emigrate
to
the
western
woods."
Louis
Moore
laughed.
"To
marry
a
White
Cloud
or
a
Big
Buffalo,
and
after
wedlock
to
devote
yourself
to
the
tender
task
of
digging
your
lord's
maize
field
while
he
smokes
his
pipe
or
drinks
fire
water."
Shirley
seemed
about
to
reply,
but
here
the
schoolroom
door
unclosed,
admitting
Mr.
Sympson.
That
personage
stood
aghast
when
he
saw
the
group
around
the
fire.
"I
thought
you
alone,
Miss
Keeldar,"
he
said.
"I
find
quite
a
party."
And
evidently
from
his
shocked,
scandalized
air,
had
he
not
recognized
in
one
of
the
party
a
clergyman,
he
would
have
delivered
an
extempore
philippic
on
the
extraordinary
habits
of
his
niece:
respect
for
the
cloth
arrested
him.
"I
merely
wished
to
announce,"
he
proceeded
coldly,
"that
the
family
from
De
Walden
Hall,
Mr.,
Mrs.,
the
Misses,
and
Mr.
Sam
Wynne,
are
in
the
drawing
room."
And
he
bowed
and
withdrew.
"The
family
from
De
Walden
Hall!
Couldn't
be
a
worse
set,"
murmured
Shirley.
She
sat
still,
looking
a
little
contumacious,
and
very
much
indisposed
to
stir.
She
was
flushed
with
the
fire.
Her
dark
hair
had
been
more
than
once
dishevelled
by
the
morning
wind
that
day.
Her
attire
was
a
light,
neatly
fitting,
but
amply
flowing
dress
of
muslin;
the
shawl
she
had
worn
in
the
garden
was
still
draped
in
a
careless
fold
round
her.
Indolent,
wilful,
picturesque,
and
singularly
pretty
was
her
aspect
prettier
than
usual,
as
if
some
soft
inward
emotion,
stirred
who
knows
how,
had
given
new
bloom
and
expression
to
her
features.
"Shirley,
Shirley,
you
ought
to
go,"
whispered
Caroline.
"I
wonder
why?"
She
lifted
her
eyes,
and
saw
in
the
glass
over
the
fireplace
both
Mr.
Hall
and
Louis
Moore
gazing
at
her
gravely.
"If,"
she
said,
with
a
yielding
smile
"if
a
majority
of
the
present
company
maintain
that
the
De
Walden
Hall
people
have
claims
on
my
civility,
I
will
subdue
my
inclinations
to
my
duty.
Let
those
who
think
I
ought
to
go
hold
up
their
hands."
Again
consulting
the
mirror,
it
reflected
an
unanimous
vote
against
her.
"You
must
go,"
said
Mr.
Hall,
"and
behave
courteously
too.
You
owe
many
duties
to
society.
It
is
not
permitted
you
to
please
only
yourself."
Louis
Moore
assented
with
a
low
"Hear,
hear!"
Caroline,
approaching
her,
smoothed
her
wavy
curls,
gave
to
her
attire
a
less
artistic
and
more
domestic
grace,
and
Shirley
was
put
out
of
the
room,
protesting
still,
by
a
pouting
lip,
against
her
dismissal.
"There
is
a
curious
charm
about
her,"
observed
Mr.
Hall,
when
she
was
gone.
"And
now,"
he
added,
"I
must
away;
for
Sweeting
is
off
to
see
his
mother,
and
there
are
two
funerals."
"Henry,
get
your
books;
it
is
lesson
time,"
said
Moore,
sitting
down
to
his
desk.
"A
curious
charm!"
repeated
the
pupil,
when
he
and
his
master
were
left
alone.
"True.
Is
she
not
a
kind
of
white
witch?"
he
asked.
"Of
whom
are
you
speaking,
sir?"
"Of
my
cousin
Shirley."
"No
irrelevant
questions;
study
in
silence."
Mr.
Moore
looked
and
spoke
sternly
sourly.
Henry
knew
this
mood.
It
was
a
rare
one
with
his
tutor;
but
when
it
came
he
had
an
awe
of
it.
He
obeyed.
Miss
Keeldar
and
her
uncle
had
characters
that
would
not
harmonize,
that
never
had
harmonized.
He
was
irritable,
and
she
was
spirited.
He
was
despotic,
and
she
liked
freedom.
He
was
worldly,
and
she,
perhaps,
romantic.
Not
without
purpose
had
he
come
down
to
Yorkshire.
His
mission
was
clear,
and
he
intended
to
discharge
it
conscientiously.
He
anxiously
desired
to
have
his
niece
married,
to
make
for
her
a
suitable
match,
give
her
in
charge
to
a
proper
husband,
and
wash
his
hands
of
her
for
ever.
The
misfortune
was,
from
infancy
upwards,
Shirley
and
he
had
disagreed
on
the
meaning
of
the
words
"suitable"
and
"proper."
She
never
yet
had
accepted
his
definition;
and
it
was
doubtful
whether,
in
the
most
important
step
of
her
life,
she
would
consent
to
accept
it.
The
trial
soon
came.
Mr.
Wynne
proposed
in
form
for
his
son,
Samuel
Fawthrop
Wynne.
"Decidedly
suitable!
most
proper!"
pronounced
Mr.
Sympson.
"A
fine
unencumbered
estate,
real
substance,
good
connections.
It
must
be
done!"
He
sent
for
his
niece
to
the
oak
parlour;
he
shut
himself
up
there
with
her
alone;
he
communicated
the
offer;
he
gave
his
opinion;
he
claimed
her
consent.
It
was
withheld.
"No;
I
shall
not
marry
Samuel
Fawthrop
Wynne."
"I
ask
why.
I
must
have
a
reason.
In
all
respects
he
is
more
than
worthy
of
you."
She
stood
on
the
hearth.
She
was
pale
as
the
white
marble
slab
and
cornice
behind
her;
her
eyes
flashed
large,
dilated,
unsmiling.
"And
I
ask
in
what
sense
that
young
man
is
worthy
of
me?"
"He
has
twice
your
money,
twice
your
common
sense,
equal
connections,
equal
respectability."
"Had
he
my
money
counted
fivescore
times
I
would
take
no
vow
to
love
him."
"Please
to
state
your
objections."
"He
has
run
a
course
of
despicable,
commonplace
profligacy.
Accept
that
as
the
first
reason
why
I
spurn
him."
"Miss
Keeldar,
you
shock
me!"
"That
conduct
alone
sinks
him
in
a
gulf
of
immeasurable
inferiority.
His
intellect
reaches
no
standard
I
can
esteem:
there
is
a
second
stumbling
block.
His
views
are
narrow,
his
feelings
are
blunt,
his
tastes
are
coarse,
his
manners
vulgar."
"The
man
is
a
respectable,
wealthy
man!
To
refuse
him
is
presumption
on
your
part."
"I
refuse
point
blank!
Cease
to
annoy
me
with
the
subject;
I
forbid
it!"
"Is
it
your
intention
ever
to
marry;
or
do
you
prefer
celibacy?"
"I
deny
your
right
to
claim
an
answer
to
that
question."
"May
I
ask
if
you
expect
some
man
of
title
some
peer
of
the
realm
to
demand
your
hand?"
"I
doubt
if
the
peer
breathes
on
whom
I
would
confer
it."
"Were
there
insanity
in
the
family,
I
should
believe
you
mad.
Your
eccentricity
and
conceit
touch
the
verge
of
frenzy."
"Perhaps,
ere
I
have
finished,
you
will
see
me
over
leap
it."
"I
anticipate
no
less.
Frantic
and
impracticable
girl!
Take
warning!
I
dare
you
to
sully
our
name
by
a
mesalliance!"
"Our
name!
Am
I
called
Sympson?"
"God
be
thanked
that
you
are
not!
But
be
on
your
guard;
I
will
not
be
trifled
with!"
"What,
in
the
name
of
common
law
and
common
sense,
would
you
or
could
you
do
if
my
pleasure
led
me
to
a
choice
you
disapproved?"
"Take
care!
take
care!"
warning
her
with
voice
and
hand
that
trembled
alike.
"Why?
What
shadow
of
power
have
you
over
me?
Why
should
I
fear
you?"
"Take
care,
madam!"
"Scrupulous
care
I
will
take,
Mr.
Sympson.
Before
I
marry
I
am
resolved
to
esteem
to
admire
to
love."
"Preposterous
stuff!
indecorous,
unwomanly!"
"To
love
with
my
whole
heart.
I
know
I
speak
in
an
unknown
tongue;
but
I
feel
indifferent
whether
I
am
comprehended
or
not."
"And
if
this
love
of
yours
should
fall
on
a
beggar?"
"On
a
beggar
it
will
never
fall.
Mendicancy
is
not
estimable."
"On
a
low
clerk,
a
play
actor,
a
play
writer,
or
or
"
"Take
courage,
Mr.
Sympson!
Or
what?"
"Any
literary
scrub,
or
shabby,
whining
artist."
"For
the
scrubby,
shabby,
whining
I
have
no
taste;
for
literature
and
the
arts
I
have.
And
there
I
wonder
how
your
Fawthrop
Wynne
would
suit
me.
He
cannot
write
a
note
without
orthographical
errors;
he
reads
only
a
sporting
paper;
he
was
the
booby
of
Stilbro'
grammar
school!"
"Unladylike
language!
Great
God!
to
what
will
she
come?"
He
lifted
hands
and
eyes.
"Never
to
the
altar
of
Hymen
with
Sam
Wynne."
"To
what
will
she
come?
Why
are
not
the
laws
more
stringent,
that
I
might
compel
her
to
hear
reason?"
"Console
yourself,
uncle.
Were
Britain
a
serfdom
and
you
the
Czar,
you
could
not
compel
me
to
this
step.
I
will
write
to
Mr.
Wynne.
Give
yourself
no
further
trouble
on
the
subject."
Fortune
is
proverbially
called
changeful,
yet
her
caprice
often
takes
the
form
of
repeating
again
and
again
a
similar
stroke
of
luck
in
the
same
quarter.
It
appeared
that
Miss
Keeldar
or
her
fortune
had
by
this
time
made
a
sensation
in
the
district,
and
produced
an
impression
in
quarters
by
her
unthought
of.
No
less
than
three
offers
followed
Mr.
Wynne's,
all
more
or
less
eligible.
All
were
in
succession
pressed
on
her
by
her
uncle,
and
all
in
succession
she
refused.
Yet
amongst
them
was
more
than
one
gentleman
of
unexceptionable
character
as
well
as
ample
wealth.
Many
besides
her
uncle
asked
what
she
meant,
and
whom
she
expected
to
entrap,
that
she
was
so
insolently
fastidious.
At
last
the
gossips
thought
they
had
found
the
key
to
her
conduct,
and
her
uncle
was
sure
of
it;
and
what
is
more,
the
discovery
showed
his
niece
to
him
in
quite
a
new
light,
and
he
changed
his
whole
deportment
to
her
accordingly.
Fieldhead
had
of
late
been
fast
growing
too
hot
to
hold
them
both.
The
suave
aunt
could
not
reconcile
them;
the
daughters
froze
at
the
view
of
their
quarrels.
Gertrude
and
Isabella
whispered
by
the
hour
together
in
their
dressing
room,
and
became
chilled
with
decorous
dread
if
they
chanced
to
be
left
alone
with
their
audacious
cousin.
But,
as
I
have
said,
a
change
supervened.
Mr.
Sympson
was
appeased
and
his
family
tranquillized.
The
village
of
Nunnely
has
been
alluded
to
its
old
church,
its
forest,
its
monastic
ruins.
It
had
also
its
hall,
called
the
priory
an
older,
a
larger,
a
more
lordly
abode
than
any
Briarfield
or
Whinbury
owned;
and
what
is
more,
it
had
its
man
of
title
its
baronet,
which
neither
Briarfield
nor
Whinbury
could
boast.
This
possession
its
proudest
and
most
prized
had
for
years
been
nominal
only.
The
present
baronet,
a
young
man
hitherto
resident
in
a
distant
province,
was
unknown
on
his
Yorkshire
estate.
During
Miss
Keeldar's
stay
at
the
fashionable
watering
place
of
Cliffbridge,
she
and
her
friends
had
met
with
and
been
introduced
to
Sir
Philip
Nunnely.
They
encountered
him
again
and
again
on
the
sands,
the
cliffs,
in
the
various
walks,
sometimes
at
the
public
balls
of
the
place.
He
seemed
solitary.
His
manner
was
very
unpretending
too
simple
to
be
termed
affable;
rather
timid
than
proud.
He
did
not
condescend
to
their
society;
he
seemed
glad
of
it.
With
any
unaffected
individual
Shirley
could
easily
and
quickly
cement
an
acquaintance.
She
walked
and
talked
with
Sir
Philip;
she,
her
aunt,
and
cousins
sometimes
took
a
sail
in
his
yacht.
She
liked
him
because
she
found
him
kind
and
modest,
and
was
charmed
to
feel
she
had
the
power
to
amuse
him.
One
slight
drawback
there
was
where
is
the
friendship
without
it?
Sir
Philip
had
a
literary
turn.
He
wrote
poetry
sonnets,
stanzas,
ballads.
Perhaps
Miss
Keeldar
thought
him
a
little
too
fond
of
reading
and
reciting
these
compositions;
perhaps
she
wished
the
rhyme
had
possessed
more
accuracy,
the
measure
more
music,
the
tropes
more
freshness,
the
inspiration
more
fire.
At
any
rate,
she
always
winced
when
he
recurred
to
the
subject
of
his
poems,
and
usually
did
her
best
to
divert
the
conversation
into
another
channel.
He
would
beguile
her
to
take
moonlight
walks
with
him
on
the
bridge,
for
the
sole
purpose,
as
it
seemed,
of
pouring
into
her
ear
the
longest
of
his
ballads.
He
would
lead
her
away
to
sequestered
rustic
seats,
whence
the
rush
of
the
surf
to
the
sands
was
heard
soft
and
soothing;
and
when
he
had
her
all
to
himself,
and
the
sea
lay
before
them,
and
the
scented
shade
of
gardens
spread
round,
and
the
tall
shelter
of
cliffs
rose
behind
them,
he
would
pull
out
his
last
batch
of
sonnets,
and
read
them
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
emotion.
He
did
not
seem
to
know
that
though
they
might
be
rhyme
they
were
not
poetry.
It
appeared,
by
Shirley's
downcast
eye
and
disturbed
face,
that
she
knew
it,
and
felt
heartily
mortified
by
the
single
foible
of
this
good
and
amiable
gentleman.
Often
she
tried,
as
gently
as
might
be,
to
wean
him
from
this
fanatic
worship
of
the
Muses.
It
was
his
monomania;
on
all
ordinary
subjects
he
was
sensible
enough,
and
fain
was
she
to
engage
him
in
ordinary
topics.
He
questioned
her
sometimes
about
his
place
at
Nunnely;
she
was
but
too
happy
to
answer
his
interrogatories
at
length.
She
never
wearied
of
describing
the
antique
priory,
the
wild
silvan
park,
the
hoary
church
and
hamlet;
nor
did
she
fail
to
counsel
him
to
come
down
and
gather
his
tenantry
about
him
in
his
ancestral
halls.
Somewhat
to
her
surprise,
Sir
Philip
followed
her
advice
to
the
letter,
and
actually,
towards
the
close
of
September,
arrived
at
the
priory.
He
soon
made
a
call
at
Fieldhead,
and
his
first
visit
was
not
his
last.
He
said
when
he
had
achieved
the
round
of
the
neighbourhood
that
under
no
roof
had
he
found
such
pleasant
shelter
as
beneath
the
massive
oak
beams
of
the
gray
manor
house
of
Briarfield;
a
cramped,
modest
dwelling
enough
compared
with
his
own,
but
he
liked
it.
Presently
it
did
not
suffice
to
sit
with
Shirley
in
her
panelled
parlour,
where
others
came
and
went,
and
where
he
could
rarely
find
a
quiet
moment
to
show
her
the
latest
production
of
his
fertile
muse;
he
must
have
her
out
amongst
the
pleasant
pastures,
and
lead
her
by
the
still
waters.
Tete
a
tete
ramblings
she
shunned,
so
he
made
parties
for
her
to
his
own
grounds,
his
glorious
forest;
to
remoter
scenes
woods
severed
by
the
Wharfe,
vales
watered
by
the
Aire.
Such
assiduity
covered
Miss
Keeldar
with
distinction.
Her
uncle's
prophetic
soul
anticipated
a
splendid
future.
He
already
scented
the
time
afar
off
when,
with
nonchalant
air,
and
left
foot
nursed
on
his
right
knee,
he
should
be
able
to
make
dashingly
familiar
allusion
to
his
"nephew
the
baronet."
Now
his
niece
dawned
upon
him
no
longer
"a
mad
girl,"
but
a
"most
sensible
woman."
He
termed
her,
in
confidential
dialogues
with
Mrs.
Sympson,
"a
truly
superior
person;
peculiar,
but
very
clever."
He
treated
her
with
exceeding
deference;
rose
reverently
to
open
and
shut
doors
for
her;
reddened
his
face
and
gave
himself
headaches
with
stooping
to
pick
up
gloves,
handkerchiefs,
and
other
loose
property,
whereof
Shirley
usually
held
but
insecure
tenure.
He
would
cut
mysterious
jokes
about
the
superiority
of
woman's
wit
over
man's
wisdom;
commence
obscure
apologies
for
the
blundering
mistake
he
had
committed
respecting
the
generalship,
the
tactics,
of
"a
personage
not
a
hundred
miles
from
Fieldhead."
In
short,
he
seemed
elate
as
any
"midden
cock
on
pattens."
His
niece
viewed
his
maneauvres
and
received
his
innuendoes
with
phlegm;
apparently
she
did
not
above
half
comprehend
to
what
aim
they
tended.
When
plainly
charged
with
being
the
preferred
of
the
baronet,
she
said
she
believed
he
did
like
her,
and
for
her
part
she
liked
him.
She
had
never
thought
a
man
of
rank
the
only
son
of
a
proud,
fond
mother,
the
only
brother
of
doting
sisters
could
have
so
much
goodness,
and,
on
the
whole,
so
much
sense.
Time
proved,
indeed,
that
Sir
Philip
liked
her.
Perhaps
he
had
found
in
her
that
"curious
charm"
noticed
by
Mr.
Hall.
He
sought
her
presence
more
and
more,
and
at
last
with
a
frequency
that
attested
it
had
become
to
him
an
indispensable
stimulus.
About
this
time
strange
feelings
hovered
round
Fieldhead;
restless
hopes
and
haggard
anxieties
haunted
some
of
its
rooms.
There
was
an
unquiet
wandering
of
some
of
the
inmates
among
the
still
fields
round
the
mansion;
there
was
a
sense
of
expectancy
that
kept
the
nerves
strained.
One
thing
seemed
clear:
Sir
Philip
was
not
a
man
to
be
despised.
He
was
amiable;
if
not
highly
intellectual,
he
was
intelligent.
Miss
Keeldar
could
not
affirm
of
him,
what
she
had
so
bitterly
affirmed
of
Sam
Wynne,
that
his
feelings
were
blunt,
his
tastes
coarse,
and
his
manners
vulgar.
There
was
sensibility
in
his
nature;
there
was
a
very
real,
if
not
a
very
discriminating,
love
of
the
arts;
there
was
the
English
gentleman
in
all
his
deportment.
As
to
his
lineage
and
wealth,
both
were,
of
course,
far
beyond
her
claims.
His
appearance
had
at
first
elicited
some
laughing
though
not
ill
natured
remarks
from
the
merry
Shirley.
It
was
boyish.
His
features
were
plain
and
slight,
his
hair
sandy,
his
stature
insignificant.
But
she
soon
checked
her
sarcasm
on
this
point;
she
would
even
fire
up
if
any
one
else
made
uncomplimentary
allusion
thereto.
He
had
"a
pleasing
countenance,"
she
affirmed;
"and
there
was
that
in
his
heart
which
was
better
than
three
Roman
noses,
than
the
locks
of
Absalom
or
the
proportions
of
Saul."
A
spare
and
rare
shaft
she
still
reserved
for
his
unfortunate
poetic
propensity;
but
even
here
she
would
tolerate
no
irony
save
her
own.
In
short,
matters
had
reached
a
point
which
seemed
fully
to
warrant
an
observation
made
about
this
time
by
Mr.
Yorke
to
the
tutor,
Louis.
"Yond'
brother
Robert
of
yours
seems
to
me
to
be
either
a
fool
or
a
madman.
Two
months
ago
I
could
have
sworn
he
had
the
game
all
in
his
own
hands;
and
there
he
runs
the
country,
and
quarters
himself
up
in
London
for
weeks
together,
and
by
the
time
he
comes
back
he'll
find
himself
checkmated.
Louis,
'there
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men,
which,
taken
at
the
flood,
leads
on
to
fortune,
but,
once
let
slip,
never
returns
again.'
I'd
write
to
Robert,
if
I
were
you,
and
remind
him
of
that."
"Robert
had
views
on
Miss
Keeldar?"
inquired
Louis,
as
if
the
idea
was
new
to
him.
"Views
I
suggested
to
him
myself,
and
views
he
might
have
realized,
for
she
liked
him."
"As
a
neighbour?"
"As
more
than
that.
I
have
seen
her
change
countenance
and
colour
at
the
mere
mention
of
his
name.
Write
to
the
lad,
I
say,
and
tell
him
to
come
home.
He
is
a
finer
gentleman
than
this
bit
of
a
baronet,
after
all."
"Does
it
not
strike
you,
Mr.
Yorke,
that
for
a
mere
penniless
adventurer
to
aspire
to
a
rich
woman's
hand
is
presumptuous
contemptible?"
"Oh,
if
you
are
for
high
notions
and
double
refined
sentiment,
I've
naught
to
say.
I'm
a
plain,
practical
man
myself,
and
if
Robert
is
willing
to
give
up
that
royal
prize
to
a
lad
rival
a
puling
slip
of
aristocracy
I
am
quite
agreeable.
At
his
age,
in
his
place,
with
his
inducements,
I
would
have
acted
differently.
Neither
baronet,
nor
duke,
nor
prince
should
have
snatched
my
sweetheart
from
me
without
a
struggle.
But
you
tutors
are
such
solemn
chaps;
it
is
almost
like
speaking
to
a
parson
to
consult
with
you."
Flattered
and
fawned
upon
as
Shirley
was
just
now,
it
appeared
she
was
not
absolutely
spoiled
that
her
better
nature
did
not
quite
leave
her.
Universal
report
had
indeed
ceased
to
couple
her
name
with
that
of
Moore,
and
this
silence
seemed
sanctioned
by
her
own
apparent
oblivion
of
the
absentee;
but
that
she
had
not
quite
forgotten
him
that
she
still
regarded
him,
if
not
with
love,
yet
with
interest
seemed
proved
by
the
increased
attention
which
at
this
juncture
of
affairs
a
sudden
attack
of
illness
induced
her
to
show
that
tutor
brother
of
Robert's,
to
whom
she
habitually
bore
herself
with
strange
alternations
of
cool
reserve
and
docile
respect
now
sweeping
past
him
in
all
the
dignity
of
the
moneyed
heiress
and
prospective
Lady
Nunnely,
and
anon
accosting
him
as
abashed
school
girls
are
wont
to
accost
their
stern
professors;
bridling
her
neck
of
ivory
and
curling
her
lip
of
carmine,
if
he
encountered
her
glance,
one
minute,
and
the
next
submitting
to
the
grave
rebuke
of
his
eye
with
as
much
contrition
as
if
he
had
the
power
to
inflict
penalties
in
case
of
contumacy.
Louis
Moore
had
perhaps
caught
the
fever,
which
for
a
few
days
laid
him
low,
in
one
of
the
poor
cottages
of
the
district,
which
he,
his
lame
pupil,
and
Mr.
Hall
were
in
the
habit
of
visiting
together.
At
any
rate
he
sickened,
and
after
opposing
to
the
malady
a
taciturn
resistance
for
a
day
or
two,
was
obliged
to
keep
his
chamber.
He
lay
tossing
on
his
thorny
bed
one
evening,
Henry,
who
would
not
quit
him,
watching
faithfully
beside
him,
when
a
tap
too
light
to
be
that
of
Mrs.
Gill
or
the
housemaid
summoned
young
Sympson
to
the
door.
"How
is
Mr.
Moore
to
night?"
asked
a
low
voice
from
the
dark
gallery.
"Come
in
and
see
him
yourself."
"Is
he
asleep?"
"I
wish
he
could
sleep.
Come
and
speak
to
him,
Shirley."
"He
would
not
like
it."
But
the
speaker
stepped
in,
and
Henry,
seeing
her
hesitate
on
the
threshold,
took
her
hand
and
drew
her
to
the
couch.
The
shaded
light
showed
Miss
Keeldar's
form
but
imperfectly;
yet
it
revealed
her
in
elegant
attire.
There
was
a
party
assembled
below,
including
Sir
Philip
Nunnely;
the
ladies
were
now
in
the
drawing
room,
and
their
hostess
had
stolen
from
them
to
visit
Henry's
tutor.
Her
pure
white
dress,
her
fair
arms
and
neck,
the
trembling
chainlet
of
gold
circling
her
throat
and
quivering
on
her
breast,
glistened
strangely
amid
the
obscurity
of
the
sickroom.
Her
mien
was
chastened
and
pensive.
She
spoke
gently.
"Mr.
Moore,
how
are
you
to
night?"
"I
have
not
been
very
ill,
and
am
now
better."
"I
heard
that
you
complained
of
thirst.
I
have
brought
you
some
grapes;
can
you
taste
one?"
"No;
but
I
thank
you
for
remembering
me."
"Just
one."
From
the
rich
cluster
that
filled
a
small
basket
held
in
her
hand
she
severed
a
berry
and
offered
it
to
his
lips.
He
shook
his
head,
and
turned
aside
his
flushed
face.
"But
what,
then,
can
I
bring
you
instead?
You
have
no
wish
for
fruit;
yet
I
see
that
your
lips
are
parched.
What
beverage
do
you
prefer?"
"Mrs.
Gill
supplies
me
with
toast
and
water.
I
like
it
best."
Silence
fell
for
some
minutes.
"Do
you
suffer?
have
you
pain?"
"Very
little."
"What
made
you
ill?"
Silence.
"I
wonder
what
caused
this
fever?
To
what
do
you
attribute
it?"
"Miasma,
perhaps
malaria.
This
is
autumn,
a
season
fertile
in
fevers."
"I
hear
you
often
visit
the
sick
in
Briarfield,
and
Nunnely
too,
with
Mr.
Hall.
You
should
be
on
your
guard;
temerity
is
not
wise."
"That
reminds
me,
Miss
Keeldar,
that
perhaps
you
had
better
not
enter
this
chamber
or
come
near
this
couch.
I
do
not
believe
my
illness
is
infectious.
I
scarcely
fear"
with
a
sort
of
smile
"you
will
take
it;
but
why
should
you
run
even
the
shadow
of
a
risk?
Leave
me."
"Patience,
I
will
go
soon;
but
I
should
like
to
do
something
for
you
before
I
depart
any
little
service
"
"They
will
miss
you
below."
"No;
the
gentlemen
are
still
at
table."
"They
will
not
linger
long.
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
is
no
wine
bibber,
and
I
hear
him
just
now
pass
from
the
dining
room
to
the
drawing
room."
"It
is
a
servant."
"It
is
Sir
Philip;
I
know
his
step."
"Your
hearing
is
acute."
"It
is
never
dull,
and
the
sense
seems
sharpened
at
present.
Sir
Philip
was
here
to
tea
last
night.
I
heard
you
sing
to
him
some
song
which
he
had
brought
you.
I
heard
him,
when
he
took
his
departure
at
eleven
o'clock,
call
you
out
on
to
the
pavement,
to
look
at
the
evening
star."
"You
must
be
nervously
sensitive."
"I
heard
him
kiss
your
hand."
"Impossible!"
"No:
my
chamber
is
over
the
hall,
the
window
just
above
the
front
door;
the
sash
was
a
little
raised,
for
I
felt
feverish.
You
stood
ten
minutes
with
him
on
the
steps.
I
heard
your
discourse,
every
word,
and
I
heard
the
salute.
Henry,
give
me
some
water."
"Let
me
give
it
him."
But
he
half
rose
to
take
the
glass
from
young
Sympson,
and
declined
her
attendance.
"And
can
I
do
nothing?"
"Nothing;
for
you
cannot
guarantee
me
a
night's
peaceful
rest,
and
it
is
all
I
at
present
want."
"You
do
not
sleep
well?"
"Sleep
has
left
me."
"Yet
you
said
you
were
not
very
ill?"
"I
am
often
sleepless
when
in
high
health."
"If
I
had
power,
I
would
lap
you
in
the
most
placid
slumber
quite
deep
and
hushed,
without
a
dream."
"Blank
annihilation!
I
do
not
ask
that."
"With
dreams
of
all
you
most
desire."
"Monstrous
delusions!
The
sleep
would
be
delirium,
the
waking
death."
"Your
wishes
are
not
so
chimerical;
you
are
no
visionary."
"Miss
Keeldar,
I
suppose
you
think
so;
but
my
character
is
not,
perhaps,
quite
as
legible
to
you
as
a
page
of
the
last
new
novel
might
be."
"That
is
possible.
But
this
sleep
I
should
like
to
woo
it
to
your
pillow,
to
win
for
you
its
favour.
If
I
took
a
book
and
sat
down
and
read
some
pages?
I
can
well
spare
half
an
hour."
"Thank
you,
but
I
will
not
detain
you."
"I
would
read
softly."
"It
would
not
do.
I
am
too
feverish
and
excitable
to
bear
a
soft,
cooing,
vibrating
voice
close
at
my
ear.
You
had
better
leave
me."
"Well,
I
will
go."
"And
no
good
night?"
"Yes,
sir,
yes.
Mr.
Moore,
good
night."
(Exit
Shirley.)
"Henry,
my
boy,
go
to
bed
now;
it
is
time
you
had
some
repose."
"Sir,
it
would
please
me
to
watch
at
your
bedside
all
night."
"Nothing
less
called
for.
I
am
getting
better.
There,
go."
"Give
me
your
blessing,
sir."
"God
bless
you,
my
best
pupil!"
"You
never
call
me
your
dearest
pupil!"
"No,
nor
ever
shall."
Possibly
Miss
Keeldar
resented
her
former
teacher's
rejection
of
her
courtesy.
It
is
certain
she
did
not
repeat
the
offer
of
it.
Often
as
her
light
step
traversed
the
gallery
in
the
course
of
a
day,
it
did
not
again
pause
at
his
door;
nor
did
her
"cooing,
vibrating
voice"
disturb
a
second
time
the
hush
of
the
sickroom.
A
sickroom,
indeed,
it
soon
ceased
to
be;
Mr.
Moore's
good
constitution
quickly
triumphed
over
his
indisposition.
In
a
few
days
he
shook
it
off,
and
resumed
his
duties
as
tutor.
That
"auld
lang
syne"
had
still
its
authority
both
with
preceptor
and
scholar
was
proved
by
the
manner
in
which
he
sometimes
promptly
passed
the
distance
she
usually
maintained
between
them,
and
put
down
her
high
reserve
with
a
firm,
quiet
hand.
One
afternoon
the
Sympson
family
were
gone
out
to
take
a
carriage
airing.
Shirley,
never
sorry
to
snatch
a
reprieve
from
their
society,
had
remained
behind,
detained
by
business,
as
she
said.
The
business
a
little
letter
writing
was
soon
dispatched
after
the
yard
gates
had
closed
on
the
carriage;
Miss
Keeldar
betook
herself
to
the
garden.
It
was
a
peaceful
autumn
day.
The
gilding
of
the
Indian
summer
mellowed
the
pastures
far
and
wide.
The
russet
woods
stood
ripe
to
be
stripped,
but
were
yet
full
of
leaf.
The
purple
of
heath
bloom,
faded
but
not
withered,
tinged
the
hills.
The
beck
wandered
down
to
the
Hollow,
through
a
silent
district;
no
wind
followed
its
course
or
haunted
its
woody
borders.
Fieldhead
gardens
bore
the
seal
of
gentle
decay.
On
the
walks,
swept
that
morning,
yellow
leaves
had
fluttered
down
again.
Its
time
of
flowers,
and
even
of
fruits,
was
over;
but
a
scantling
of
apples
enriched
the
trees.
Only
a
blossom
here
and
there
expanded
pale
and
delicate
amidst
a
knot
of
faded
leaves.
These
single
flowers
the
last
of
their
race
Shirley
culled
as
she
wandered
thoughtfully
amongst
the
beds.
She
was
fastening
into
her
girdle
a
hueless
and
scentless
nosegay,
when
Henry
Sympson
called
to
her
as
he
came
limping
from
the
house.
"Shirley,
Mr.
Moore
would
be
glad
to
see
you
in
the
schoolroom
and
to
hear
you
read
a
little
French,
if
you
have
no
more
urgent
occupation."
The
messenger
delivered
his
commission
very
simply,
as
if
it
were
a
mere
matter
of
course.
"Did
Mr.
Moore
tell
you
to
say
that?"
"Certainly;
why
not?
And
now,
do
come,
and
let
us
once
more
be
as
we
were
at
Sympson
Grove.
We
used
to
have
pleasant
school
hours
in
those
days."
Miss
Keeldar
perhaps
thought
that
circumstances
were
changed
since
then;
however,
she
made
no
remark,
but
after
a
little
reflection
quietly
followed
Henry.
Entering
the
schoolroom,
she
inclined
her
head
with
a
decent
obeisance,
as
had
been
her
wont
in
former
times.
She
removed
her
bonnet,
and
hung
it
up
beside
Henry's
cap.
Louis
Moore
sat
at
his
desk,
turning
the
leaves
of
a
book,
open
before
him,
and
marking
passages
with
his
pencil.
He
just
moved,
in
acknowledgment
of
her
curtsy,
but
did
not
rise.
"You
proposed
to
read
to
me
a
few
nights
ago,"
said
he.
"I
could
not
hear
you
then.
My
attention
is
now
at
your
service.
A
little
renewed
practice
in
French
may
not
be
unprofitable.
Your
accent,
I
have
observed,
begins
to
rust."
"What
book
shall
I
take?"
"Here
are
the
posthumous
works
of
St.
Pierre.
Read
a
few
pages
of
the
'Fragments
de
l'Amazone.'"
She
accepted
the
chair
which
he
had
placed
in
readiness
near
his
own;
the
volume
lay
on
his
desk
there
was
but
one
between
them;
her
sweeping
curls
dropped
so
low
as
to
hide
the
page
from
him.
"Put
back
your
hair,"
he
said.
For
one
moment
Shirley
looked
not
quite
certain
whether
she
would
obey
the
request
or
disregard
it.
A
flicker
of
her
eye
beamed
furtive
on
the
professor's
face.
Perhaps
if
he
had
been
looking
at
her
harshly
or
timidly,
or
if
one
undecided
line
had
marked
his
countenance,
she
would
have
rebelled,
and
the
lesson
had
ended
there
and
then;
but
he
was
only
awaiting
her
compliance
as
calm
as
marble,
and
as
cool.
She
threw
the
veil
of
tresses
behind
her
ear.
It
was
well
her
face
owned
an
agreeable
outline,
and
that
her
cheek
possessed
the
polish
and
the
roundness
of
early
youth,
or,
thus
robbed
of
a
softening
shade,
the
contours
might
have
lost
their
grace.
But
what
mattered
that
in
the
present
society?
Neither
Calypso
nor
Eucharis
cared
to
fascinate
Mentor.
She
began
to
read.
The
language
had
become
strange
to
her
tongue;
it
faltered;
the
lecture
flowed
unevenly,
impeded
by
hurried
breath,
broken
by
Anglicized
tones.
She
stopped.
"I
can't
do
it.
Read
me
a
paragraph,
if
you
please,
Mr.
Moore."
What
he
read
she
repeated.
She
caught
his
accent
in
three
minutes.
"Tres
bien,"
was
the
approving
comment
at
the
close
of
the
piece.
"C'est
presque
le
Francais
rattrape,
n'est
ce
pas?"
"You
could
not
write
French
as
you
once
could,
I
dare
say?"
"Oh
no!
I
should
make
strange
work
of
my
concords
now."
"You
could
not
compose
the
devoir
of
'La
Premiere
Femme
Savante'?"
"Do
you
still
remember
that
rubbish?"
"Every
line."
"I
doubt
you."
"I
will
engage
to
repeat
it
word
for
word."
"You
would
stop
short
at
the
first
line."
"Challenge
me
to
the
experiment."
"I
challenge
you."
He
proceeded
to
recite
the
following.
He
gave
it
in
French,
but
we
must
translate,
on
pain
of
being
unintelligible
to
some
readers.
"And
it
came
to
pass,
when
men
began
to
multiply
on
the
face
of
the
earth,
and
daughters
were
born
unto
them,
that
the
sons
of
God
saw
the
daughters
of
men
that
they
were
fair;
and
they
took
them
wives
of
all
which
they
chose."
This
was
in
the
dawn
of
time,
before
the
morning
stars
were
set,
and
while
they
yet
sang
together.
The
epoch
is
so
remote,
the
mists
and
dewy
gray
of
matin
twilight
veil
it
with
so
vague
an
obscurity,
that
all
distinct
feature
of
custom,
all
clear
line
of
locality,
evade
perception
and
baffle
research.
It
must
suffice
to
know
that
the
world
then
existed;
that
men
peopled
it;
that
man's
nature,
with
its
passions,
sympathies,
pains,
and
pleasures,
informed
the
planet
and
gave
it
soul.
A
certain
tribe
colonized
a
certain
spot
on
the
globe;
of
what
race
this
tribe
unknown;
in
what
region
that
spot
untold.
We
usually
think
of
the
East
when
we
refer
to
transactions
of
that
date;
but
who
shall
declare
that
there
was
no
life
in
the
West,
the
South,
the
North?
What
is
to
disprove
that
this
tribe,
instead
of
camping
under
palm
groves
in
Asia,
wandered
beneath
island
oak
woods
rooted
in
our
own
seas
of
Europe?
It
is
no
sandy
plain,
nor
any
circumscribed
and
scant
oasis
I
seem
to
realize.
A
forest
valley,
with
rocky
sides
and
brown
profundity
of
shade,
formed
by
tree
crowding
on
tree,
descends
deep
before
me.
Here,
indeed,
dwell
human
beings,
but
so
few,
and
in
alleys
so
thick
branched
and
overarched,
they
are
neither
heard
nor
seen.
Are
they
savage?
Doubtless.
They
live
by
the
crook
and
the
bow;
half
shepherds,
half
hunters,
their
flocks
wander
wild
as
their
prey.
Are
they
happy?
No,
not
more
happy
than
we
are
at
this
day.
Are
they
good?
No,
not
better
than
ourselves.
Their
nature
is
our
nature
human
both.
There
is
one
in
this
tribe
too
often
miserable
a
child
bereaved
of
both
parents.
None
cares
for
this
child.
She
is
fed
sometimes,
but
oftener
forgotten.
A
hut
rarely
receives
her;
the
hollow
tree
and
chill
cavern
are
her
home.
Forsaken,
lost,
and
wandering,
she
lives
more
with
the
wild
beast
and
bird
than
with
her
own
kind.
Hunger
and
cold
are
her
comrades;
sadness
hovers
over,
and
solitude
besets
her
round.
Unheeded
and
unvalued,
she
should
die;
but
she
both
lives
and
grows.
The
green
wilderness
nurses
her,
and
becomes
to
her
a
mother;
feeds
her
on
juicy
berry,
on
saccharine
root
and
nut.
There
is
something
in
the
air
of
this
clime
which
fosters
life
kindly.
There
must
be
something,
too,
in
its
dews
which
heals
with
sovereign
balm.
Its
gentle
seasons
exaggerate
no
passion,
no
sense;
its
temperature
tends
to
harmony;
its
breezes,
you
would
say,
bring
down
from
heaven
the
germ
of
pure
thought
and
purer
feeling.
Not
grotesquely
fantastic
are
the
forms
of
cliff
and
foliage,
not
violently
vivid
the
colouring
of
flower
and
bird.
In
all
the
grandeur
of
these
forests
there
is
repose;
in
all
their
freshness
there
is
tenderness.
The
gentle
charm
vouchsafed
to
flower
and
tree,
bestowed
on
deer
and
dove,
has
not
been
denied
to
the
human
nursling.
All
solitary,
she
has
sprung
up
straight
and
graceful.
Nature
cast
her
features
in
a
fine
mould;
they
have
matured
in
their
pure,
accurate
first
lines,
unaltered
by
the
shocks
of
disease.
No
fierce
dry
blast
has
dealt
rudely
with
the
surface
of
her
frame;
no
burning
sun
has
crisped
or
withered
her
tresses.
Her
form
gleams
ivory
white
through
the
trees;
her
hair
flows
plenteous,
long,
and
glossy;
her
eyes,
not
dazzled
by
vertical
fires,
beam
in
the
shade
large
and
open,
and
full
and
dewy.
Above
those
eyes,
when
the
breeze
bares
her
forehead,
shines
an
expanse
fair
and
ample
a
clear,
candid
page,
whereon
knowledge,
should
knowledge
ever
come,
might
write
a
golden
record.
You
see
in
the
desolate
young
savage
nothing
vicious
or
vacant.
She
haunts
the
wood
harmless
and
thoughtful,
though
of
what
one
so
untaught
can
think
it
is
not
easy
to
divine.
On
the
evening
of
one
summer
day,
before
the
Flood,
being
utterly
alone
for
she
had
lost
all
trace
of
her
tribe,
who
had
wandered
leagues
away,
she
knew
not
where
she
went
up
from
the
vale,
to
watch
Day
take
leave
and
Night
arrive.
A
crag
overspread
by
a
tree
was
her
station.
The
oak
roots,
turfed
and
mossed,
gave
a
seat;
the
oak
boughs,
thick
leaved,
wove
a
canopy.
Slow
and
grand
the
Day
withdrew,
passing
in
purple
fire,
and
parting
to
the
farewell
of
a
wild,
low
chorus
from
the
woodlands.
Then
Night
entered,
quiet
as
death.
The
wind
fell,
the
birds
ceased
singing.
Now
every
nest
held
happy
mates,
and
hart
and
hind
slumbered
blissfully
safe
in
their
lair.
The
girl
sat,
her
body
still,
her
soul
astir;
occupied,
however,
rather
in
feeling
than
in
thinking,
in
wishing
than
hoping,
in
imagining
than
projecting.
She
felt
the
world,
the
sky,
the
night,
boundlessly
mighty.
Of
all
things
herself
seemed
to
herself
the
centre
a
small,
forgotten
atom
of
life,
a
spark
of
soul,
emitted
inadvertent
from
the
great
creative
source,
and
now
burning
unmarked
to
waste
in
the
heart
of
a
black
hollow.
She
asked,
was
she
thus
to
burn
out
and
perish,
her
living
light
doing
no
good,
never
seen,
never
needed
a
star
in
an
else
starless
firmament,
which
nor
shepherd,
nor
wanderer,
nor
sage,
nor
priest
tracked
as
a
guide
or
read
as
a
prophecy?
Could
this
be,
she
demanded,
when
the
flame
of
her
intelligence
burned
so
vivid;
when
her
life
beat
so
true,
and
real,
and
potent;
when
something
within
her
stirred
disquieted,
and
restlessly
asserted
a
God
given
strength,
for
which
it
insisted
she
should
find
exercise?
She
gazed
abroad
on
Heaven
and
Evening.
Heaven
and
Evening
gazed
back
on
her.
She
bent
down,
searching
bank,
hill,
river,
spread
dim
below.
All
she
questioned
responded
by
oracles.
She
heard
she
was
impressed;
but
she
could
not
understand.
Above
her
head
she
raised
her
hands
joined
together.
"Guidance
help
comfort
come!"
was
her
cry.
There
was
no
voice,
nor
any
that
answered.
She
waited,
kneeling,
steadfastly
looking
up.
Yonder
sky
was
sealed;
the
solemn
stars
shone
alien
and
remote.
At
last
one
overstretched
chord
of
her
agony
slacked;
she
thought
Something
above
relented;
she
felt
as
if
Something
far
round
drew
nigher;
she
heard
as
if
Silence
spoke.
There
was
no
language,
no
word,
only
a
tone.
Again
a
fine,
full,
lofty
tone,
a
deep,
soft
sound,
like
a
storm
whispering,
made
twilight
undulate.
Once
more,
profounder,
nearer,
clearer,
it
rolled
harmonious.
Yet
again
a
distinct
voice
passed
between
Heaven
and
Earth.
"Eva!"
If
Eva
were
not
this
woman's
name,
she
had
none.
She
rose.
"Here
am
I."
"Eva!"
"O
Night
(it
can
be
but
Night
that
speaks),
I
am
here!"
The
voice,
descending,
reached
Earth.
"Eva!"
"Lord,"
she
cried,
"behold
thine
handmaid!"
She
had
her
religion
all
tribes
held
some
creed.
"I
come
a
Comforter!"
"Lord,
come
quickly!"
The
Evening
flushed
full
of
hope;
the
Air
panted;
the
Moon
rising
before
ascended
large,
but
her
light
showed
no
shape.
"Lean
towards
me,
Eva.
Enter
my
arms;
repose
thus."
"Thus
I
lean,
O
Invisible
but
felt!
And
what
art
thou?"
"Eva,
I
have
brought
a
living
draught
from
heaven.
Daughter
of
Man,
drink
of
my
cup!"
"I
drink:
it
is
as
if
sweetest
dew
visited
my
lips
in
a
full
current.
My
arid
heart
revives;
my
affliction
is
lightened;
my
strait
and
struggle
are
gone.
And
the
night
changes!
the
wood,
the
hill,
the
moon,
the
wide
sky
all
change!"
"All
change,
and
for
ever.
I
take
from
thy
vision
darkness;
I
loosen
from
thy
faculties
fetters!
I
level
in
thy
path
obstacles;
I
with
my
presence
fill
vacancy.
I
claim
as
mine
the
lost
atom
of
life.
I
take
to
myself
the
spark
of
soul
burning
heretofore
forgotten!"
"O
take
me!
O
claim
me!
This
is
a
god."
"This
is
a
son
of
God
one
who
feels
himself
in
the
portion
of
life
that
stirs
you.
He
is
suffered
to
reclaim
his
own,
and
so
to
foster
and
aid
that
it
shall
not
perish
hopeless."
"A
son
of
God!
Am
I
indeed
chosen?"
"Thou
only
in
this
land.
I
saw
thee
that
thou
wert
fair;
I
knew
thee
that
thou
wert
mine.
To
me
it
is
given
to
rescue,
to
sustain,
to
cherish
mine
own.
Acknowledge
in
me
that
Seraph
on
earth
named
Genius."
"My
glorious
Bridegroom!
true
Dayspring
from
on
high!
All
I
would
have
at
last
I
possess.
I
receive
a
revelation.
The
dark
hint,
the
obscure
whisper,
which
have
haunted
me
from
childhood,
are
interpreted.
Thou
art
He
I
sought.
Godborn,
take
me,
thy
bride!"
"Unhumbled,
I
can
take
what
is
mine.
Did
I
not
give
from
the
altar
the
very
flame
which
lit
Eva's
being?
Come
again
into
the
heaven
whence
thou
wert
sent."
That
Presence,
invisible
but
mighty,
gathered
her
in
like
a
lamb
to
the
fold;
that
voice,
soft
but
all
pervading,
vibrated
through
her
heart
like
music.
Her
eye
received
no
image;
and
yet
a
sense
visited
her
vision
and
her
brain
as
of
the
serenity
of
stainless
air,
the
power
of
sovereign
seas,
the
majesty
of
marching
stars,
the
energy
of
colliding
elements,
the
rooted
endurance
of
hills
wide
based,
and,
above
all,
as
of
the
lustre
of
heroic
beauty
rushing
victorious
on
the
Night,
vanquishing
its
shadows
like
a
diviner
sun.
Such
was
the
bridal
hour
of
Genius
and
Humanity.
Who
shall
rehearse
the
tale
of
their
after
union?
Who
shall
depict
its
bliss
and
bale?
Who
shall
tell
how
He
between
whom
and
the
Woman
God
put
enmity
forged
deadly
plots
to
break
the
bond
or
defile
its
purity?
Who
shall
record
the
long
strife
between
Serpent
and
Seraph:
How
still
the
Father
of
Lies
insinuated
evil
into
good,
pride
into
wisdom,
grossness
into
glory,
pain
into
bliss,
poison
into
passion?
How
the
"dreadless
Angel"
defied,
resisted,
and
repelled?
How
again
and
again
he
refined
the
polluted
cup,
exalted
the
debased
emotion,
rectified
the
perverted
impulse,
detected
the
lurking
venom,
baffled
the
frontless
temptation
purified,
justified,
watched,
and
withstood?
How,
by
his
patience,
by
his
strength,
by
that
unutterable
excellence
he
held
from
God
his
Origin
this
faithful
Seraph
fought
for
Humanity
a
good
fight
through
time;
and,
when
Time's
course
closed,
and
Death
was
encountered
at
the
end,
barring
with
fleshless
arm
the
portals
of
Eternity,
how
Genius
still
held
close
his
dying
bride,
sustained
her
through
the
agony
of
the
passage,
bore
her
triumphant
into
his
own
home,
Heaven;
restored
her,
redeemed,
to
Jehovah,
her
Maker;
and
at
last,
before
Angel
and
Archangel,
crowned
her
with
the
crown
of
Immortality?
Who
shall
of
these
things
write
the
chronicle?
"I
never
could
correct
that
composition,"
observed
Shirley,
as
Moore
concluded.
"Your
censor
pencil
scored
it
with
condemnatory
lines,
whose
signification
I
strove
vainly
to
fathom."
She
had
taken
a
crayon
from
the
tutor's
desk,
and
was
drawing
little
leaves,
fragments
of
pillars,
broken
crosses,
on
the
margin
of
the
book.
"French
may
be
half
forgotten,
but
the
habits
of
the
French
lesson
are
retained,
I
see,"
said
Louis.
"My
books
would
now,
as
erst,
be
unsafe
with
you.
My
newly
bound
St.
Pierre
would
soon
be
like
my
Racine
Miss
Keeldar,
her
mark,
traced
on
every
page."
Shirley
dropped
her
crayon
as
if
it
burned
her
fingers.
"Tell
me
what
were
the
faults
of
that
devoir?"
she
asked.
"Were
they
grammatical
errors,
or
did
you
object
to
the
substance?"
"I
never
said
that
the
lines
I
drew
were
indications
of
faults
at
all.
You
would
have
it
that
such
was
the
case,
and
I
refrained
from
contradiction."
"What
else
did
they
denote?"
"No
matter
now."
"Mr.
Moore,"
cried
Henry,
"make
Shirley
repeat
some
of
the
pieces
she
used
to
say
so
well
by
heart."
"If
I
ask
for
any,
it
will
be
'Le
Cheval
Dompte,'"
said
Moore,
trimming
with
his
penknife
the
pencil
Miss
Keeldar
had
worn
to
a
stump.
She
turned
aside
her
head;
the
neck,
the
clear
cheek,
forsaken
by
their
natural
veil,
were
seen
to
flush
warm.
"Ah!
she
has
not
forgotten,
you
see,
sir,"
said
Henry,
exultant.
"She
knows
how
naughty
she
was."
A
smile,
which
Shirley
would
not
permit
to
expand,
made
her
lip
tremble;
she
bent
her
face,
and
hid
it
half
with
her
arms,
half
in
her
curls,
which,
as
she
stooped,
fell
loose
again.
"Certainly
I
was
a
rebel,"
she
answered.
"A
rebel!"
repeated
Henry.
"Yes;
you
and
papa
had
quarrelled
terribly,
and
you
set
both
him
and
mamma,
and
Mrs.
Pryor,
and
everybody,
at
defiance.
You
said
he
had
insulted
you
"
"He
had
insulted
me,"
interposed
Shirley.
"And
you
wanted
to
leave
Sympson
Grove
directly.
You
packed
your
things
up,
and
papa
threw
them
out
of
your
trunk;
mamma
cried,
Mrs.
Pryor
cried;
they
both
stood
wringing
their
hands
begging
you
to
be
patient;
and
you
knelt
on
the
floor
with
your
things
and
your
up
turned
box
before
you,
looking,
Shirley,
looking
why,
in
one
of
your
passions.
Your
features,
in
such
passions,
are
not
distorted;
they
are
fixed,
but
quite
beautiful.
You
scarcely
look
angry,
only
resolute,
and
in
a
certain
haste;
yet
one
feels
that
at
such
times
an
obstacle
cast
across
your
path
would
be
split
as
with
lightning.
Papa
lost
heart,
and
called
Mr.
Moore."
"Enough,
Henry."
"No,
it
is
not
enough.
I
hardly
know
how
Mr.
Moore
managed,
except
that
I
recollect
he
suggested
to
papa
that
agitation
would
bring
on
his
gout;
and
then
he
spoke
quietly
to
the
ladies,
and
got
them
away;
and
afterwards
he
said
to
you,
Miss
Shirley,
that
it
was
of
no
use
talking
or
lecturing
now,
but
that
the
tea
things
were
just
brought
into
the
schoolroom,
and
he
was
very
thirsty,
and
he
would
be
glad
if
you
would
leave
your
packing
for
the
present
and
come
and
make
a
cup
of
tea
for
him
and
me.
You
came;
you
would
not
talk
at
first,
but
soon
you
softened
and
grew
cheerful.
Mr.
Moore
began
to
tell
us
about
the
Continent,
the
war,
and
Bonaparte
subjects
we
were
both
fond
of
listening
to.
After
tea
he
said
we
should
neither
of
us
leave
him
that
evening;
he
would
not
let
us
stray
out
of
his
sight,
lest
we
should
again
get
into
mischief.
We
sat
one
on
each
side
of
him.
We
were
so
happy.
I
never
passed
so
pleasant
an
evening.
The
next
day
he
gave
you,
missy,
a
lecture
of
an
hour,
and
wound
it
up
by
marking
you
a
piece
to
learn
in
Bossuet
as
a
punishment
lesson
'Le
Cheval
Dompte.'
You
learned
it
instead
of
packing
up,
Shirley.
We
heard
no
more
of
your
running
away.
Mr.
Moore
used
to
tease
you
on
the
subject
for
a
year
afterwards."
"She
never
said
a
lesson
with
greater
spirit,"
subjoined
Moore.
"She
then,
for
the
first
time,
gave
me
the
treat
of
hearing
my
native
tongue
spoken
without
accent
by
an
English
girl."
"She
was
as
sweet
as
summer
cherries
for
a
month
afterwards,"
struck
in
Henry:
"a
good
hearty
quarrel
always
left
Shirley's
temper
better
than
it
found
it."
"You
talk
of
me
as
if
I
were
not
present,"
observed
Miss
Keeldar,
who
had
not
yet
lifted
her
face.
"Are
you
sure
you
are
present?"
asked
Moore.
"There
have
been
moments
since
my
arrival
here
when
I
have
been
tempted
to
inquire
of
the
lady
of
Fieldhead
if
she
knew
what
had
become
of
my
former
pupil."
"She
is
here
now."
"I
see
her,
and
humble
enough;
but
I
would
neither
advise
Harry
nor
others
to
believe
too
implicitly
in
the
humility
which
one
moment
can
hide
its
blushing
face
like
a
modest
little
child,
and
the
next
lift
it
pale
and
lofty
as
a
marble
Juno."
"One
man
in
times
of
old,
it
is
said,
imparted
vitality
to
the
statue
he
had
chiselled;
others
may
have
the
contrary
gift
of
turning
life
to
stone."
Moore
paused
on
this
observation
before
he
replied
to
it.
His
look,
at
once
struck
and
meditative,
said,
"A
strange
phrase;
what
may
it
mean?"
He
turned
it
over
in
his
mind,
with
thought
deep
and
slow,
as
some
German
pondering
metaphysics.
"You
mean,"
he
said
at
last,
"that
some
men
inspire
repugnance,
and
so
chill
the
kind
heart."
"Ingenious!"
responded
Shirley.
"If
the
interpretation
pleases
you,
you
are
welcome
to
hold
it
valid.
I
don't
care."
And
with
that
she
raised
her
head,
lofty
in
look
and
statue
like
in
hue,
as
Louis
had
described
it.
"Behold
the
metamorphosis!"
he
said;
"scarce
imagined
ere
it
is
realized:
a
lowly
nymph
develops
to
an
inaccessible
goddess.
But
Henry
must
not
be
disappointed
of
his
recitation,
and
Olympia
will
deign
to
oblige
him.
Let
us
begin."
"I
have
forgotten
the
very
first
line."
"Which
I
have
not.
My
memory,
if
a
slow,
is
a
retentive
one.
I
acquire
deliberately
both
knowledge
and
liking.
The
acquisition
grows
into
my
brain,
and
the
sentiment
into
my
breast;
and
it
is
not
as
the
rapid
springing
produce
which,
having
no
root
in
itself,
flourishes
verdurous
enough
for
a
time,
but
too
soon
falls
withered
away.
Attention,
Henry!
Miss
Keeldar
consents
to
favour
you.
'Voyez
ce
cheval
ardent
et
impetueux,'
so
it
commences."
Miss
Keeldar
did
consent
to
make
the
effort;
but
she
soon
stopped.
"Unless
I
heard
the
whole
repeated
I
cannot
continue
it,"
she
said.
"Yet
it
was
quickly
learned
'soon
gained,
soon
gone,'"
moralized
the
tutor.
He
recited
the
passage
deliberately,
accurately,
with
slow,
impressive
emphasis.
Shirley,
by
degrees,
inclined
her
ear
as
he
went
on.
Her
face,
before
turned
from
him,
returned
towards
him.
When
he
ceased,
she
took
the
word
up
as
if
from
his
lips;
she
took
his
very
tone;
she
seized
his
very
accent;
she
delivered
the
periods
as
he
had
delivered
them;
she
reproduced
his
manner,
his
pronunciation,
his
expression.
It
was
now
her
turn
to
petition.
"Recall
'Le
Songe
d'Athalie,'"
she
entreated,
"and
say
it."
He
said
it
for
her.
She
took
it
from
him;
she
found
lively
excitement
in
the
pleasure
of
making
his
language
her
own.
She
asked
for
further
indulgence;
all
the
old
school
pieces
were
revived,
and
with
them
Shirley's
old
school
days.
He
had
gone
through
some
of
the
best
passages
of
Racine
and
Corneille,
and
then
had
heard
the
echo
of
his
own
deep
tones
in
the
girl's
voice,
that
modulated
itself
faithfully
on
his.
"Le
chene
et
le
Roseau,"
that
most
beautiful
of
La
Fontaine's
fables,
had
been
recited,
well
recited,
by
the
tutor,
and
the
pupil
had
animatedly
availed
herself
of
the
lesson.
Perhaps
a
simultaneous
feeling
seized
them
now,
that
their
enthusiasm
had
kindled
to
a
glow,
which
the
slight
fuel
of
French
poetry
no
longer
sufficed
to
feed;
perhaps
they
longed
for
a
trunk
of
English
oak
to
be
thrown
as
a
Yule
log
to
the
devouring
flame.
Moore
observed,
"And
these
are
our
best
pieces!
And
we
have
nothing
more
dramatic,
nervous,
natural!"
And
then
he
smiled
and
was
silent.
His
whole
nature
seemed
serenely
alight.
He
stood
on
the
hearth,
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece,
musing
not
unblissfully.
Twilight
was
closing
on
the
diminished
autumn
day.
The
schoolroom
windows
darkened
with
creeping
plants,
from
which
no
high
October
winds
had
as
yet
swept
the
sere
foliage
admitted
scarce
a
gleam
of
sky;
but
the
fire
gave
light
enough
to
talk
by.
And
now
Louis
Moore
addressed
his
pupil
in
French,
and
she
answered
at
first
with
laughing
hesitation
and
in
broken
phrase.
Moore
encouraged
while
he
corrected
her.
Henry
joined
in
the
lesson;
the
two
scholars
stood
opposite
the
master,
their
arms
round
each
other's
waists.
Tartar,
who
long
since
had
craved
and
obtained
admission,
sat
sagely
in
the
centre
of
the
rug,
staring
at
the
blaze
which
burst
fitful
from
morsels
of
coal
among
the
red
cinders.
The
group
were
happy
enough,
but
"Pleasures
are
like
poppies
spread;
You
seize
the
flower
its
bloom
is
shed."
The
dull,
rumbling
sound
of
wheels
was
heard
on
the
pavement
in
the
yard.
"It
is
the
carriage
returned,"
said
Shirley;
"and
dinner
must
be
just
ready,
and
I
am
not
dressed."
A
servant
came
in
with
Mr.
Moore's
candle
and
tea;
for
the
tutor
and
his
pupil
usually
dined
at
luncheon
time.
"Mr.
Sympson
and
the
ladies
are
returned,"
she
said,
"and
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
is
with
them."
"How
you
did
start,
and
how
your
hand
trembled,
Shirley!"
said
Henry,
when
the
maid
had
closed
the
shutter
and
was
gone.
"But
I
know
why
don't
you,
Mr.
Moore?
I
know
what
papa
intends.
He
is
a
little
ugly
man,
that
Sir
Philip.
I
wish
he
had
not
come.
I
wish
sisters
and
all
of
them
had
stayed
at
De
Walden
Hall
to
dine.
Shirley
should
once
more
have
made
tea
for
you
and
me,
Mr.
Moore,
and
we
would
have
had
a
happy
evening
of
it."
Moore
was
locking
up
his
desk
and
putting
away
his
St.
Pierre.
"That
was
your
plan,
was
it,
my
boy?"
"Don't
you
approve
it,
sir?"
"I
approve
nothing
utopian.
Look
Life
in
its
iron
face;
stare
Reality
out
of
its
brassy
countenance.
Make
the
tea,
Henry;
I
shall
be
back
in
a
minute."
He
left
the
room;
so
did
Shirley,
by
another
door.
Shirley
probably
got
on
pleasantly
with
Sir
Philip
that
evening,
for
the
next
morning
she
came
down
in
one
of
her
best
moods.
"Who
will
take
a
walk
with
me?"
she
asked,
after
breakfast.
"Isabella
and
Gertrude,
will
you?"
So
rare
was
such
an
invitation
from
Miss
Keeldar
to
her
female
cousins
that
they
hesitated
before
they
accepted
it.
Their
mamma,
however,
signifying
acquiescence
in
the
project,
they
fetched
their
bonnets,
and
the
trio
set
out.
It
did
not
suit
these
three
young
persons
to
be
thrown
much
together.
Miss
Keeldar
liked
the
society
of
few
ladies;
indeed,
she
had
a
cordial
pleasure
in
that
of
none
except
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Caroline
Helstone.
She
was
civil,
kind,
attentive
even
to
her
cousins;
but
still
she
usually
had
little
to
say
to
them.
In
the
sunny
mood
of
this
particular
morning,
she
contrived
to
entertain
even
the
Misses
Sympson.
Without
deviating
from
her
wonted
rule
of
discussing
with
them
only
ordinary
themes,
she
imparted
to
these
themes
an
extraordinary
interest;
the
sparkle
of
her
spirit
glanced
along
her
phrases.
What
made
her
so
joyous?
All
the
cause
must
have
been
in
herself.
The
day
was
not
bright.
It
was
dim
a
pale,
waning
autumn
day.
The
walks
through
the
dun
woods
were
damp;
the
atmosphere
was
heavy,
the
sky
overcast;
and
yet
it
seemed
that
in
Shirley's
heart
lived
all
the
light
and
azure
of
Italy,
as
all
its
fervour
laughed
in
her
gray
English
eye.
Some
directions
necessary
to
be
given
to
her
foreman,
John,
delayed
her
behind
her
cousins
as
they
neared
Fieldhead
on
their
return.
Perhaps
an
interval
of
twenty
minutes
elapsed
between
her
separation
from
them
and
her
re
entrance
into
the
house.
In
the
meantime
she
had
spoken
to
John,
and
then
she
had
lingered
in
the
lane
at
the
gate.
A
summons
to
luncheon
called
her
in.
She
excused
herself
from
the
meal,
and
went
upstairs.
"Is
not
Shirley
coming
to
luncheon?"
asked
Isabella.
"She
said
she
was
hungry."
An
hour
after,
as
she
did
not
quit
her
chamber,
one
of
her
cousins
went
to
seek
her
there.
She
was
found
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
bed,
her
head
resting
on
her
hand;
she
looked
quite
pale,
very
thoughtful,
almost
sad.
"You
are
not
ill?"
was
the
question
put.
"A
little
sick,"
replied
Miss
Keeldar.
Certainly
she
was
not
a
little
changed
from
what
she
had
been
two
hours
before.
This
change,
accounted
for
only
by
those
three
words,
explained
no
otherwise;
this
change
whencesoever
springing,
effected
in
a
brief
ten
minutes
passed
like
no
light
summer
cloud.
She
talked
when
she
joined
her
friends
at
dinner,
talked
as
usual.
She
remained
with
them
during
the
evening.
When
again
questioned
respecting
her
health,
she
declared
herself
perfectly
recovered.
It
had
been
a
mere
passing
faintness,
a
momentary
sensation,
not
worth
a
thought;
yet
it
was
felt
there
was
a
difference
in
Shirley.
The
next
day
the
day,
the
week,
the
fortnight
after
this
new
and
peculiar
shadow
lingered
on
the
countenance,
in
the
manner
of
Miss
Keeldar.
A
strange
quietude
settled
over
her
look,
her
movements,
her
very
voice.
The
alteration
was
not
so
marked
as
to
court
or
permit
frequent
questioning,
yet
it
was
there,
and
it
would
not
pass
away.
It
hung
over
her
like
a
cloud
which
no
breeze
could
stir
or
disperse.
Soon
it
became
evident
that
to
notice
this
change
was
to
annoy
her.
First
she
shrank
from
remark;
and,
if
persisted
in,
she,
with
her
own
peculiar
hauteur,
repelled
it.
"Was
she
ill?"
The
reply
came
with
decision.
"I
am
not."
"Did
anything
weigh
on
her
mind?
Had
anything
happened
to
affect
her
spirits?"
She
scornfully
ridiculed
the
idea.
"What
did
they
mean
by
spirits?
She
had
no
spirits,
black
or
white,
blue
or
gray,
to
affect."
"Something
must
be
the
matter
she
was
so
altered."
"She
supposed
she
had
a
right
to
alter
at
her
ease.
She
knew
she
was
plainer.
If
it
suited
her
to
grow
ugly,
why
need
others
fret
themselves
on
the
subject?"
"There
must
be
a
cause
for
the
change.
What
was
it?"
She
peremptorily
requested
to
be
let
alone.
Then
she
would
make
every
effort
to
appear
quite
gay,
and
she
seemed
indignant
at
herself
that
she
could
not
perfectly
succeed.
Brief
self
spurning
epithets
burst
from
her
lips
when
alone.
"Fool!
coward!"
she
would
term
herself.
"Poltroon!"
she
would
say,
"if
you
must
tremble,
tremble
in
secret!
Quail
where
no
eye
sees
you!"
"How
dare
you,"
she
would
ask
herself
"how
dare
you
show
your
weakness
and
betray
your
imbecile
anxieties?
Shake
them
off;
rise
above
them.
If
you
cannot
do
this,
hide
them."
And
to
hide
them
she
did
her
best.
She
once
more
became
resolutely
lively
in
company.
When
weary
of
effort
and
forced
to
relax,
she
sought
solitude
not
the
solitude
of
her
chamber
(she
refused
to
mope,
shut
up
between
four
walls),
but
that
wilder
solitude
which
lies
out
of
doors,
and
which
she
could
chase,
mounted
on
Zoe,
her
mare.
She
took
long
rides
of
half
a
day.
Her
uncle
disapproved,
but
he
dared
not
remonstrate.
It
was
never
pleasant
to
face
Shirley's
anger,
even
when
she
was
healthy
and
gay;
but
now
that
her
face
showed
thin,
and
her
large
eye
looked
hollow,
there
was
something
in
the
darkening
of
that
face
and
kindling
of
that
eye
which
touched
as
well
as
alarmed.
To
all
comparative
strangers
who,
unconscious
of
the
alterations
in
her
spirits,
commented
on
the
alteration
in
her
looks,
she
had
one
reply,
"I
am
perfectly
well;
I
have
not
an
ailment."
And
health,
indeed,
she
must
have
had,
to
be
able
to
bear
the
exposure
to
the
weather
she
now
encountered.
Wet
or
fair,
calm
or
storm,
she
took
her
daily
ride
over
Stilbro'
Moor,
Tartar
keeping
up
at
her
side,
with
his
wolf
like
gallop,
long
and
untiring.
Twice,
three
times,
the
eyes
of
gossips
those
eyes
which
are
everywhere,
in
the
closet
and
on
the
hill
top
noticed
that
instead
of
turning
on
Rushedge,
the
top
ridge
of
Stilbro'
Moor,
she
rode
forwards
all
the
way
to
the
town.
Scouts
were
not
wanting
to
mark
her
destination
there.
It
was
ascertained
that
she
alighted
at
the
door
of
one
Mr.
Pearson
Hall,
a
solicitor,
related
to
the
vicar
of
Nunnely.
This
gentleman
and
his
ancestors
had
been
the
agents
of
the
Keeldar
family
for
generations
back.
Some
people
affirmed
that
Miss
Keeldar
was
become
involved
in
business
speculations
connected
with
Hollow's
Mill
that
she
had
lost
money,
and
was
constrained
to
mortgage
her
land.
Others
conjectured
that
she
was
going
to
be
married,
and
that
the
settlements
were
preparing.
Mr.
Moore
and
Henry
Sympson
were
together
in
the
schoolroom.
The
tutor
was
waiting
for
a
lesson
which
the
pupil
seemed
busy
in
preparing.
"Henry,
make
haste.
The
afternoon
is
getting
on."
"Is
it,
sir?"
"Certainly.
Are
you
nearly
ready
with
that
lesson?"
"No."
"Not
nearly
ready?"
"I
have
not
construed
a
line."
Mr.
Moore
looked
up.
The
boy's
tone
was
rather
peculiar.
"The
task
presents
no
difficulties,
Henry;
or,
if
it
does,
bring
them
to
me.
We
will
work
together."
"Mr.
Moore,
I
can
do
no
work."
"My
boy,
you
are
ill."
"Sir,
I
am
not
worse
in
bodily
health
than
usual,
but
my
heart
is
full."
"Shut
the
book.
Come
hither,
Harry.
Come
to
the
fireside."
Harry
limped
forward.
His
tutor
placed
him
in
a
chair;
his
lips
were
quivering,
his
eyes
brimming.
He
laid
his
crutch
on
the
floor,
bent
down
his
head,
and
wept.
"This
distress
is
not
occasioned
by
physical
pain,
you
say,
Harry?
You
have
a
grief;
tell
it
me."
"Sir,
I
have
such
a
grief
as
I
never
had
before.
I
wish
it
could
be
relieved
in
some
way;
I
can
hardly
bear
it."
"Who
knows
but,
if
we
talk
it
over,
we
may
relieve
it?
What
is
the
cause?
Whom
does
it
concern?"
"The
cause,
sir,
is
Shirley;
it
concerns
Shirley."
"Does
it?
You
think
her
changed?"
"All
who
know
her
think
her
changed
you
too,
Mr.
Moore."
"Not
seriously
no.
I
see
no
alteration
but
such
as
a
favourable
turn
might
repair
in
a
few
weeks;
besides,
her
own
word
must
go
for
something:
she
says
she
is
well."
"There
it
is,
sir.
As
long
as
she
maintained
she
was
well,
I
believed
her.
When
I
was
sad
out
of
her
sight,
I
soon
recovered
spirits
in
her
presence.
Now
"
"Well,
Harry,
now.
Has
she
said
anything
to
you?
You
and
she
were
together
in
the
garden
two
hours
this
morning.
I
saw
her
talking,
and
you
listening.
Now,
my
dear
Harry,
if
Miss
Keeldar
has
said
she
is
ill,
and
enjoined
you
to
keep
her
secret,
do
not
obey
her.
For
her
life's
sake,
avow
everything.
Speak,
my
boy."
"She
say
she
is
ill!
I
believe,
sir,
if
she
were
dying,
she
would
smile,
and
aver,
'Nothing
ails
me.'"
"What
have
you
learned
then?
What
new
circumstance?"
"I
have
learned
that
she
has
just
made
her
will."
"Made
her
will?"
The
tutor
and
pupil
were
silent.
"She
told
you
that?"
asked
Moore,
when
some
minutes
had
elapsed.
"She
told
me
quite
cheerfully,
not
as
an
ominous
circumstance,
which
I
felt
it
to
be.
She
said
I
was
the
only
person
besides
her
solicitor,
Pearson
Hall,
and
Mr.
Helstone
and
Mr.
Yorke,
who
knew
anything
about
it;
and
to
me,
she
intimated,
she
wished
specially
to
explain
its
provisions."
"Go
on,
Harry."
"'Because,'
she
said,
looking
down
on
me
with
her
beautiful
eyes
oh!
they
are
beautiful,
Mr.
Moore!
I
love
them!
I
love
her!
She
is
my
star!
Heaven
must
not
claim
her!
She
is
lovely
in
this
world,
and
fitted
for
this
world.
Shirley
is
not
an
angel;
she
is
a
woman,
and
she
shall
live
with
men.
Seraphs
shall
not
have
her!
Mr.
Moore,
if
one
of
the
'sons
of
God,'
with
wings
wide
and
bright
as
the
sky,
blue
and
sounding
as
the
sea,
having
seen
that
she
was
fair,
descended
to
claim
her,
his
claim
should
be
withstood
withstood
by
me
boy
and
cripple
as
I
am."
"Henry
Sympson,
go
on,
when
I
tell
you."
"'Because,'
she
said,
'if
I
made
no
will,
and
died
before
you,
Harry,
all
my
property
would
go
to
you;
and
I
do
not
intend
that
it
should
be
so,
though
your
father
would
like
it.
But
you,'
she
said,
'will
have
his
whole
estate,
which
is
large
larger
than
Fieldhead.
Your
sisters
will
have
nothing;
so
I
have
left
them
some
money,
though
I
do
not
love
them,
both
together,
half
so
much
as
I
love
one
lock
of
your
fair
hair.'
She
said
these
words,
and
she
called
me
her
'darling,'
and
let
me
kiss
her.
She
went
on
to
tell
me
that
she
had
left
Caroline
Helstone
some
money
too;
that
this
manor
house,
with
its
furniture
and
books,
she
had
bequeathed
to
me,
as
she
did
not
choose
to
take
the
old
family
place
from
her
own
blood;
and
that
all
the
rest
of
her
property,
amounting
to
about
twelve
thousand
pounds,
exclusive
of
the
legacies
to
my
sisters
and
Miss
Helstone,
she
had
willed,
not
to
me,
seeing
I
was
already
rich,
but
to
a
good
man,
who
would
make
the
best
use
of
it
that
any
human
being
could
do
a
man,
she
said,
that
was
both
gentle
and
brave,
strong
and
merciful
a
man
that
might
not
profess
to
be
pious,
but
she
knew
he
had
the
secret
of
religion
pure
and
undefiled
before
God.
The
spirit
of
love
and
peace
was
with
him.
He
visited
the
fatherless
and
widows
in
their
affliction,
and
kept
himself
unspotted
from
the
world.
Then
she
asked,
'Do
you
approve
what
I
have
done,
Harry?'
I
could
not
answer.
My
tears
choked
me,
as
they
do
now."
Mr.
Moore
allowed
his
pupil
a
moment
to
contend
with
and
master
his
emotion.
He
then
demanded,
"What
else
did
she
say?"
"When
I
had
signified
my
full
consent
to
the
conditions
of
her
will,
she
told
me
I
was
a
generous
boy,
and
she
was
proud
of
me.
'And
now,'
she
added,
'in
case
anything
should
happen,
you
will
know
what
to
say
to
Malice
when
she
comes
whispering
hard
things
in
your
ear,
insinuating
that
Shirley
has
wronged
you,
that
she
did
not
love
you.
You
will
know
that
I
did
love
you,
Harry;
that
no
sister
could
have
loved
you
better
my
own
treasure.'
Mr.
Moore,
sir,
when
I
remember
her
voice,
and
recall
her
look,
my
heart
beats
as
if
it
would
break
its
strings.
She
may
go
to
heaven
before
me
if
God
commands
it,
she
must;
but
the
rest
of
my
life
and
my
life
will
not
be
long,
I
am
glad
of
that
now
shall
be
a
straight,
quick,
thoughtful
journey
in
the
path
her
step
has
pressed.
I
thought
to
enter
the
vault
of
the
Keeldars
before
her.
Should
it
be
otherwise,
lay
my
coffin
by
Shirley's
side."
Moore
answered
him
with
a
weighty
calm,
that
offered
a
strange
contrast
to
the
boy's
perturbed
enthusiasm.
"You
are
wrong,
both
of
you
you
harm
each
other.
If
youth
once
falls
under
the
influence
of
a
shadowy
terror,
it
imagines
there
will
never
be
full
sunlight
again;
its
first
calamity
it
fancies
will
last
a
lifetime.
What
more
did
she
say?
Anything
more?"
"We
settled
one
or
two
family
points
between
ourselves."
"I
should
rather
like
to
know
what
"
"But,
Mr.
Moore,
you
smile.
I
could
not
smile
to
see
Shirley
in
such
a
mood."
"My
boy,
I
am
neither
nervous,
nor
poetic,
nor
inexperienced.
I
see
things
as
they
are;
you
don't
as
yet.
Tell
me
these
family
points."
"Only,
sir,
she
asked
me
whether
I
considered
myself
most
of
a
Keeldar
or
a
Sympson;
and
I
answered
I
was
Keeldar
to
the
core
of
the
heart
and
to
the
marrow
of
the
bones.
She
said
she
was
glad
of
it;
for,
besides
her,
I
was
the
only
Keeldar
left
in
England.
And
then
we
agreed
on
some
matters."
"Well?"
"Well,
sir,
that
if
I
lived
to
inherit
my
father's
estate,
and
her
house,
I
was
to
take
the
name
of
Keeldar,
and
to
make
Fieldhead
my
residence.
Henry
Shirley
Keeldar
I
said
I
would
be
called;
and
I
will.
Her
name
and
her
manor
house
are
ages
old,
and
Sympson
and
Sympson
Grove
are
of
yesterday."
"Come,
you
are
neither
of
you
going
to
heaven
yet.
I
have
the
best
hopes
of
you
both,
with
your
proud
distinctions
a
pair
of
half
fledged
eaglets.
Now,
what
is
your
inference
from
all
you
have
told
me?
Put
it
into
words."
"That
Shirley
thinks
she
is
going
to
die."
"She
referred
to
her
health?"
"Not
once;
but
I
assure
you
she
is
wasting.
Her
hands
are
grown
quite
thin,
and
so
is
her
cheek."
"Does
she
ever
complain
to
your
mother
or
sisters?"
"Never.
She
laughs
at
them
when
they
question
her.
Mr.
Moore,
she
is
a
strange
being,
so
fair
and
girlish
not
a
man
like
woman
at
all,
not
an
Amazon,
and
yet
lifting
her
head
above
both
help
and
sympathy."
"Do
you
know
where
she
is
now,
Henry?
Is
she
in
the
house,
or
riding
out?"
"Surely
not
out,
sir.
It
rains
fast."
"True;
which,
however,
is
no
guarantee
that
she
is
not
at
this
moment
cantering
over
Rushedge.
Of
late
she
has
never
permitted
weather
to
be
a
hindrance
to
her
rides."
"You
remember,
Mr.
Moore,
how
wet
and
stormy
it
was
last
Wednesday
so
wild,
indeed,
that
she
would
not
permit
Zoe
to
be
saddled?
Yet
the
blast
she
thought
too
tempestuous
for
her
mare
she
herself
faced
on
foot;
that
afternoon
she
walked
nearly
as
far
as
Nunnely.
I
asked
her,
when
she
came
in,
if
she
was
not
afraid
of
taking
cold.
'Not
I,'
she
said.
'It
would
be
too
much
good
luck
for
me.
I
don't
know,
Harry,
but
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
me
would
be
to
take
a
good
cold
and
fever,
and
so
pass
off
like
other
Christians.'
She
is
reckless,
you
see,
sir."
"Reckless
indeed!
Go
and
find
out
where
she
is,
and
if
you
can
get
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
without
attracting
attention,
request
her
to
come
here
a
minute."
"Yes,
sir."
He
snatched
his
crutch,
and
started
up
to
go.
"Harry!"
He
returned.
"Do
not
deliver
the
message
formally.
Word
it
as,
in
former
days,
you
would
have
worded
an
ordinary
summons
to
the
schoolroom."
"I
see,
sir.
She
will
be
more
likely
to
obey."
"And,
Harry
"
"Sir?"
"I
will
call
you
when
I
want
you.
Till
then,
you
are
dispensed
from
lessons."
He
departed.
Mr.
Moore,
left
alone,
rose
from
his
desk.
"I
can
be
very
cool
and
very
supercilious
with
Henry,"
he
said.
"I
can
seem
to
make
light
of
his
apprehensions,
and
look
down
du
haut
de
ma
grandeur
on
his
youthful
ardour.
To
him
I
can
speak
as
if,
in
my
eyes,
they
were
both
children.
Let
me
see
if
I
can
keep
up
the
same
role
with
her.
I
have
known
the
moment
when
I
seemed
about
to
forget
it,
when
Confusion
and
Submission
seemed
about
to
crush
me
with
their
soft
tyranny,
when
my
tongue
faltered,
and
I
have
almost
let
the
mantle
drop,
and
stood
in
her
presence,
not
master
no
but
something
else.
I
trust
I
shall
never
so
play
the
fool.
It
is
well
for
a
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
to
redden
when
he
meets
her
eye.
He
may
permit
himself
the
indulgence
of
submission.
He
may
even,
without
disgrace,
suffer
his
hand
to
tremble
when
it
touches
hers;
but
if
one
of
her
farmers
were
to
show
himself
susceptible
and
sentimental,
he
would
merely
prove
his
need
of
a
strait
waistcoat.
So
far
I
have
always
done
very
well.
She
has
sat
near
me,
and
I
have
not
shaken
more
than
my
desk.
I
have
encountered
her
looks
and
smiles
like
why,
like
a
tutor,
as
I
am.
Her
hand
I
never
yet
touched
never
underwent
that
test.
Her
farmer
or
her
footman
I
am
not
no
serf
nor
servant
of
hers
have
I
ever
been;
but
I
am
poor,
and
it
behoves
me
to
look
to
my
self
respect
not
to
compromise
an
inch
of
it.
What
did
she
mean
by
that
allusion
to
the
cold
people
who
petrify
flesh
to
marble?
It
pleased
me
I
hardly
know
why;
I
would
not
permit
myself
to
inquire.
I
never
do
indulge
in
scrutiny
either
of
her
language
or
countenance;
for
if
I
did,
I
should
sometimes
forget
common
sense
and
believe
in
romance.
A
strange,
secret
ecstasy
steals
through
my
veins
at
moments.
I'll
not
encourage
I'll
not
remember
it.
I
am
resolved,
as
long
as
may
be,
to
retain
the
right
to
say
with
Paul,
'I
am
not
mad,
but
speak
forth
the
words
of
truth
and
soberness.'"
He
paused,
listening.
"Will
she
come,
or
will
she
not
come?"
he
inquired.
"How
will
she
take
the
message?
Naively
or
disdainfully?
Like
a
child
or
like
a
queen?
Both
characters
are
in
her
nature.
"If
she
comes,
what
shall
I
say
to
her?
How
account,
firstly,
for
the
freedom
of
the
request?
Shall
I
apologize
to
her?
I
could
in
all
humility;
but
would
an
apology
tend
to
place
us
in
the
positions
we
ought
relatively
to
occupy
in
this
matter?
I
must
keep
up
the
professor,
otherwise
I
hear
a
door."
He
waited.
Many
minutes
passed.
"She
will
refuse
me.
Henry
is
entreating
her
to
come;
she
declines.
My
petition
is
presumption
in
her
eyes.
Let
her
only
come,
I
can
teach
her
to
the
contrary.
I
would
rather
she
were
a
little
perverse;
it
will
steel
me.
I
prefer
her
cuirassed
in
pride,
armed
with
a
taunt.
Her
scorn
startles
me
from
my
dreams;
I
stand
up
myself.
A
sarcasm
from
her
eyes
or
lips
puts
strength
into
every
nerve
and
sinew
I
have.
Some
step
approaches,
and
not
Henry's."
The
door
unclosed;
Miss
Keeldar
came
in.
The
message,
it
appeared,
had
found
her
at
her
needle;
she
brought
her
work
in
her
hand.
That
day
she
had
not
been
riding
out;
she
had
evidently
passed
it
quietly.
She
wore
her
neat
indoor
dress
and
silk
apron.
This
was
no
Thalestris
from
the
fields,
but
a
quiet
domestic
character
from
the
fireside.
Mr.
Moore
had
her
at
advantage.
He
should
have
addressed
her
at
once
in
solemn
accents,
and
with
rigid
mien.
Perhaps
he
would,
had
she
looked
saucy;
but
her
air
never
showed
less
of
cranerie.
A
soft
kind
of
youthful
shyness
depressed
her
eyelid
and
mantled
on
her
cheek.
The
tutor
stood
silent.
She
made
a
full
stop
between
the
door
and
his
desk.
"Did
you
want
me,
sir?"
she
asked.
"I
ventured,
Miss
Keeldar,
to
send
for
you
that
is,
to
ask
an
interview
of
a
few
minutes."
She
waited;
she
plied
her
needle.
"Well,
sir"
(not
lifting
her
eyes),
"what
about?"
"Be
seated
first.
The
subject
I
would
broach
is
one
of
some
moment.
Perhaps
I
have
hardly
a
right
to
approach
it.
It
is
possible
I
ought
to
frame
an
apology;
it
is
possible
no
apology
can
excuse
me.
The
liberty
I
have
taken
arises
from
a
conversation
with
Henry.
The
boy
is
unhappy
about
your
health;
all
your
friends
are
unhappy
on
that
subject.
It
is
of
your
health
I
would
speak."
"I
am
quite
well,"
she
said
briefly.
"Yet
changed."
"That
matters
to
none
but
myself.
We
all
change."
"Will
you
sit
down?
Formerly,
Miss
Keeldar,
I
had
some
influence
with
you:
have
I
any
now?
May
I
feel
that
what
I
am
saying
is
not
accounted
positive
presumption?"
"Let
me
read
some
French,
Mr.
Moore,
or
I
will
even
take
a
spell
at
the
Latin
grammar,
and
let
us
proclaim
a
truce
to
all
sanitary
discussions."
"No,
no.
It
is
time
there
were
discussions."
"Discuss
away,
then,
but
do
not
choose
me
for
your
text.
I
am
a
healthy
subject."
"Do
you
not
think
it
wrong
to
affirm
and
reaffirm
what
is
substantially
untrue?"
"I
say
I
am
well.
I
have
neither
cough,
pain,
nor
fever."
"Is
there
no
equivocation
in
that
assertion?
Is
it
the
direct
truth?"
"The
direct
truth."
Louis
Moore
looked
at
her
earnestly.
"I
can
myself,"
he
said,
"trace
no
indications
of
actual
disease.
But
why,
then,
are
you
altered?"
"Am
I
altered?"
"We
will
try.
We
will
seek
a
proof."
"How?"
"I
ask,
in
the
first
place,
do
you
sleep
as
you
used
to?"
"I
do
not;
but
it
is
not
because
I
am
ill."
"Have
you
the
appetite
you
once
had?"
"No;
but
it
is
not
because
I
am
ill."
"You
remember
this
little
ring
fastened
to
my
watch
chain?
It
was
my
mother's,
and
is
too
small
to
pass
the
joint
of
my
little
finger.
You
have
many
a
time
sportively
purloined
it.
It
fitted
your
fore
finger.
Try
now."
She
permitted
the
test.
The
ring
dropped
from
the
wasted
little
hand.
Louis
picked
it
up,
and
reattached
it
to
the
chain.
An
uneasy
flush
coloured
his
brow.
Shirley
again
said,
"It
is
not
because
I
am
ill."
"Not
only
have
you
lost
sleep,
appetite,
and
flesh,"
proceeded
Moore,
"but
your
spirits
are
always
at
ebb.
Besides,
there
is
a
nervous
alarm
in
your
eye,
a
nervous
disquiet
in
your
manner.
These
peculiarities
were
not
formerly
yours."
"Mr.
Moore,
we
will
pause
here.
You
have
exactly
hit
it.
I
am
nervous.
Now,
talk
of
something
else.
What
wet
weather
we
have
steady,
pouring
rain!"
"You
nervous?
Yes;
and
if
Miss
Keeldar
is
nervous,
it
is
not
without
a
cause.
Let
me
reach
it.
Let
me
look
nearer.
The
ailment
is
not
physical.
I
have
suspected
that.
It
came
in
one
moment.
I
know
the
day.
I
noticed
the
change.
Your
pain
is
mental."
"Not
at
all.
It
is
nothing
so
dignified
merely
nervous.
Oh!
dismiss
the
topic."
"When
it
is
exhausted;
not
till
then.
Nervous
alarms
should
always
be
communicated,
that
they
may
be
dissipated.
I
wish
I
had
the
gift
of
persuasion,
and
could
incline
you
to
speak
willingly.
I
believe
confession,
in
your
case,
would
be
half
equivalent
to
cure."
"No,"
said
Shirley
abruptly.
"I
wish
that
were
at
all
probable;
but
I
am
afraid
it
is
not."
She
suspended
her
work
a
moment.
She
was
now
seated.
Resting
her
elbow
on
the
table,
she
leaned
her
head
on
her
hand.
Mr.
Moore
looked
as
if
he
felt
he
had
at
last
gained
some
footing
in
this
difficult
path.
She
was
serious,
and
in
her
wish
was
implied
an
important
admission;
after
that
she
could
no
longer
affirm
that
nothing
ailed
her.
The
tutor
allowed
her
some
minutes
for
repose
and
reflection
ere
he
returned
to
the
charge.
Once
his
lips
moved
to
speak,
but
he
thought
better
of
it,
and
prolonged
the
pause.
Shirley
lifted
her
eye
to
his.
Had
he
betrayed
injudicious
emotion,
perhaps
obstinate
persistence
in
silence
would
have
been
the
result;
but
he
looked
calm,
strong,
trustworthy.
"I
had
better
tell
you
than
my
aunt,"
she
said,
"or
than
my
cousins,
or
my
uncle.
They
would
all
make
such
a
bustle,
and
it
is
that
very
bustle
I
dread
the
alarm,
the
flurry,
the
eclat.
In
short,
I
never
liked
to
be
the
centre
of
a
small
domestic
whirlpool.
You
can
bear
a
little
shock
eh?"
"A
great
one,
if
necessary."
Not
a
muscle
of
the
man's
frame
moved,
and
yet
his
large
heart
beat
fast
in
his
deep
chest.
What
was
she
going
to
tell
him?
Was
irremediable
mischief
done?
"Had
I
thought
it
right
to
go
to
you,
I
would
never
have
made
a
secret
of
the
matter
one
moment,"
she
continued.
"I
would
have
told
you
at
once,
and
asked
advice."
"Why
was
it
not
right
to
come
to
me?"
"It
might
be
right
I
do
not
mean
that;
but
I
could
not
do
it.
I
seemed
to
have
no
title
to
trouble
you.
The
mishap
concerned
me
only.
I
wanted
to
keep
it
to
myself,
and
people
will
not
let
me.
I
tell
you,
I
hate
to
be
an
object
of
worrying
attention,
or
a
theme
for
village
gossip.
Besides,
it
may
pass
away
without
result
God
knows!"
Moore,
though
tortured
with
suspense,
did
not
demand
a
quick
explanation.
He
suffered
neither
gesture,
glance,
nor
word
to
betray
impatience.
His
tranquillity
tranquillized
Shirley;
his
confidence
reassured
her.
"Great
effects
may
spring
from
trivial
causes,"
she
remarked,
as
she
loosened
a
bracelet
from
her
wrist.
Then,
unfastening
her
sleeve,
and
partially
turning
it
up,
"Look
here,
Mr.
Moore."
She
showed
a
mark
in
her
white
arm
rather
a
deep
though
healed
up
indentation
something
between
a
burn
and
a
cut.
"I
would
not
show
that
to
any
one
in
Briarfield
but
you,
because
you
can
take
it
quietly."
"Certainly
there
is
nothing
in
the
little
mark
to
shock.
Its
history
will
explain."
"Small
as
it
is,
it
has
taken
my
sleep
away,
and
made
me
nervous,
thin,
and
foolish;
because,
on
account
of
that
little
mark,
I
am
obliged
to
look
forward
to
a
possibility
that
has
its
terrors."
The
sleeve
was
readjusted,
the
bracelet
replaced.
"Do
you
know
that
you
try
me?"
he
said,
smiling.
"I
am
a
patient
sort
of
man,
but
my
pulse
is
quickening."
"Whatever
happens,
you
will
befriend
me,
Mr.
Moore?
You
will
give
me
the
benefit
of
your
self
possession,
and
not
leave
me
at
the
mercy
of
agitated
cowards?"
"I
make
no
promise
now.
Tell
me
the
tale,
and
then
exact
what
pledge
you
will."
"It
is
a
very
short
tale.
I
took
a
walk
with
Isabella
and
Gertrude
one
day,
about
three
weeks
ago.
They
reached
home
before
me;
I
stayed
behind
to
speak
to
John.
After
leaving
him,
I
pleased
myself
with
lingering
in
the
lane,
where
all
was
very
still
and
shady.
I
was
tired
of
chattering
to
the
girls,
and
in
no
hurry
to
rejoin
them.
As
I
stood
leaning
against
the
gate
pillar,
thinking
some
very
happy
thoughts
about
my
future
life
for
that
morning
I
imagined
that
events
were
beginning
to
turn
as
I
had
long
wished
them
to
turn
"
"Ah!
Nunnely
had
been
with
her
the
evening
before!"
thought
Moore
parenthetically.
"I
heard
a
panting
sound;
a
dog
came
running
up
the
lane.
I
know
most
of
the
dogs
in
this
neighbourhood.
It
was
Pheabe,
one
of
Mr.
Sam
Wynne's
pointers.
The
poor
creature
ran
with
her
head
down,
her
tongue
hanging
out;
she
looked
as
if
bruised
and
beaten
all
over.
I
called
her.
I
meant
to
coax
her
into
the
house
and
give
her
some
water
and
dinner.
I
felt
sure
she
had
been
ill
used.
Mr.
Sam
often
flogs
his
pointers
cruelly.
She
was
too
flurried
to
know
me;
and
when
I
attempted
to
pat
her
head,
she
turned
and
snatched
at
my
arm.
She
bit
it
so
as
to
draw
blood,
then
ran
panting
on.
Directly
after,
Mr.
Wynne's
keeper
came
up,
carrying
a
gun.
He
asked
if
I
had
seen
a
dog.
I
told
him
I
had
seen
Pheabe.
"'You
had
better
chain
up
Tartar,
ma'am,'
he
said,
'and
tell
your
people
to
keep
within
the
house.
I
am
after
Pheabe
to
shoot
her,
and
the
groom
is
gone
another
way.
She
is
raging
mad.'"
Mr.
Moore
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
folded
his
arms
across
his
chest.
Miss
Keeldar
resumed
her
square
of
silk
canvas,
and
continued
the
creation
of
a
wreath
of
Parmese
violets.
"And
you
told
no
one,
sought
no
help,
no
cure?
You
would
not
come
to
me?"
"I
got
as
far
as
the
schoolroom
door;
there
my
courage
failed.
I
preferred
to
cushion
the
matter."
"Why?
What
can
I
demand
better
in
this
world
than
to
be
of
use
to
you?"
"I
had
no
claim."
"Monstrous!
And
you
did
nothing?"
"Yes.
I
walked
straight
into
the
laundry,
where
they
are
ironing
most
of
the
week,
now
that
I
have
so
many
guests
in
the
house.
While
the
maid
was
busy
crimping
or
starching,
I
took
an
Italian
iron
from
the
fire,
and
applied
the
light
scarlet
glowing
tip
to
my
arm.
I
bored
it
well
in.
It
cauterized
the
little
wound.
Then
I
went
upstairs."
"I
dare
say
you
never
once
groaned?"
"I
am
sure
I
don't
know.
I
was
very
miserable
not
firm
or
tranquil
at
all,
I
think.
There
was
no
calm
in
my
mind."
"There
was
calm
in
your
person.
I
remember
listening
the
whole
time
we
sat
at
luncheon,
to
hear
if
you
moved
in
the
room
above.
All
was
quiet."
"I
was
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
bed,
wishing
Pheabe
had
not
bitten
me."
"And
alone.
You
like
solitude."
"Pardon
me."
"You
disdain
sympathy."
"Do
I,
Mr.
Moore?"
"With
your
powerful
mind
you
must
feel
independent
of
help,
of
advice,
of
society."
"So
be
it,
since
it
pleases
you."
She
smiled.
She
pursued
her
embroidery
carefully
and
quickly,
but
her
eyelash
twinkled,
and
then
it
glittered,
and
then
a
drop
fell.
Mr.
Moore
leaned
forward
on
his
desk,
moved
his
chair,
altered
his
attitude.
"If
it
is
not
so,"
he
asked,
with
a
peculiar,
mellow
change
in
his
voice,
"how
is
it,
then?"
"I
don't
know."
"You
do
know,
but
you
won't
speak.
All
must
be
locked
up
in
yourself."
"Because
it
is
not
worth
sharing."
"Because
nobody
can
give
the
high
price
you
require
for
your
confidence.
Nobody
is
rich
enough
to
purchase
it.
Nobody
has
the
honour,
the
intellect,
the
power
you
demand
in
your
adviser.
There
is
not
a
shoulder
in
England
on
which
you
would
rest
your
hand
for
support,
far
less
a
bosom
which
you
would
permit
to
pillow
your
head.
Of
course
you
must
live
alone."
"I
can
live
alone,
if
need
be.
But
the
question
is
not
how
to
live,
but
how
to
die
alone.
That
strikes
me
in
a
more
grisly
light."
"You
apprehend
the
effects
of
the
virus?
You
anticipate
an
indefinitely
threatening,
dreadful
doom?"
She
bowed.
"You
are
very
nervous
and
womanish."
"You
complimented
me
two
minutes
since
on
my
powerful
mind."
"You
are
very
womanish.
If
the
whole
affair
were
coolly
examined
and
discussed,
I
feel
assured
it
would
turn
out
that
there
is
no
danger
of
your
dying
at
all."
"Amen!
I
am
very
willing
to
live,
if
it
please
God.
I
have
felt
life
sweet."
"How
can
it
be
otherwise
than
sweet
with
your
endowments
and
nature?
Do
you
truly
expect
that
you
will
be
seized
with
hydrophobia,
and
die
raving
mad?"
"I
expect
it,
and
have
feared
it.
Just
now
I
fear
nothing."
"Nor
do
I,
on
your
account.
I
doubt
whether
the
smallest
particle
of
virus
mingled
with
your
blood;
and
if
it
did,
let
me
assure
you
that,
young,
healthy,
faultlessly
sound
as
you
are,
no
harm
will
ensue.
For
the
rest,
I
shall
inquire
whether
the
dog
was
really
mad.
I
hold
she
was
not
mad."
"Tell
nobody
that
she
bit
me."
"Why
should
I,
when
I
believe
the
bite
innocuous
as
a
cut
of
this
penknife?
Make
yourself
easy.
I
am
easy,
though
I
value
your
life
as
much
as
I
do
my
own
chance
of
happiness
in
eternity.
Look
up."
"Why,
Mr.
Moore?"
"I
wish
to
see
if
you
are
cheered.
Put
your
work
down;
raise
your
head."
"There
"
"Look
at
me.
Thank
you.
And
is
the
cloud
broken?"
"I
fear
nothing."
"Is
your
mind
restored
to
its
own
natural
sunny
clime?"
"I
am
very
content;
but
I
want
your
promise."
"Dictate."
"You
know,
in
case
the
worst
I
have
feared
should
happen,
they
will
smother
me.
You
need
not
smile.
They
will;
they
always
do.
My
uncle
will
be
full
of
horror,
weakness,
precipitation;
and
that
is
the
only
expedient
which
will
suggest
itself
to
him.
Nobody
in
the
house
will
be
self
possessed
but
you.
Now
promise
to
befriend
me
to
keep
Mr.
Sympson
away
from
me,
not
to
let
Henry
come
near,
lest
I
should
hurt
him.
Mind
mind
that
you
take
care
of
yourself
too.
But
I
shall
not
injure
you;
I
know
I
shall
not.
Lock
the
chamber
door
against
the
surgeons;
turn
them
out
if
they
get
in.
Let
neither
the
young
nor
the
old
MacTurk
lay
a
finger
on
me;
nor
Mr.
Greaves,
their
colleague;
and
lastly,
if
I
give
trouble,
with
your
own
hand
administer
to
me
a
strong
narcotic
such
a
sure
dose
of
laudanum
as
shall
leave
no
mistake.
Promise
to
do
this."
Moore
left
his
desk,
and
permitted
himself
the
recreation
of
one
or
two
turns
through
the
room.
Stopping
behind
Shirley's
chair,
he
bent
over
her,
and
said,
in
a
low,
emphatic
voice,
"I
promise
all
you
ask
without
comment,
without
reservation."
"If
female
help
is
needed,
call
in
my
housekeeper,
Mrs.
Gill.
Let
her
lay
me
out
if
I
die.
She
is
attached
to
me.
She
wronged
me
again
and
again,
and
again
and
again
I
forgave
her.
She
now
loves
me,
and
would
not
defraud
me
of
a
pin.
Confidence
has
made
her
honest;
forbearance
has
made
her
kind
hearted.
At
this
day
I
can
trust
both
her
integrity,
her
courage,
and
her
affection.
Call
her;
but
keep
my
good
aunt
and
my
timid
cousins
away.
Once
more,
promise."
"I
promise."
"That
is
good
in
you,"
she
said,
looking
up
at
him
as
he
bent
over
her,
and
smiling.
"Is
it
good?
Does
it
comfort?"
"Very
much."
"I
will
be
with
you
I
and
Mrs.
Gill
only
in
any,
in
every
extremity
where
calm
and
fidelity
are
needed.
No
rash
or
coward
hand
shall
meddle."
"Yet
you
think
me
childish?"
"I
do."
"Ah!
you
despise
me."
"Do
we
despise
children?"
"In
fact,
I
am
neither
so
strong,
nor
have
I
such
pride
in
my
strength,
as
people
think,
Mr.
Moore;
nor
am
I
so
regardless
of
sympathy.
But
when
I
have
any
grief,
I
fear
to
impart
it
to
those
I
love,
lest
it
should
pain
them;
and
to
those
whom
I
view
with
indifference
I
cannot
condescend
to
complain.
After
all,
you
should
not
taunt
me
with
being
childish,
for
if
you
were
as
unhappy
as
I
have
been
for
the
last
three
weeks,
you
too
would
want
some
friend."
"We
all
want
a
friend,
do
we
not?"
"All
of
us
that
have
anything
good
in
our
natures."
"Well,
you
have
Caroline
Helstone."
"Yes.
And
you
have
Mr.
Hall."
"Yes.
Mrs.
Pryor
is
a
wise,
good
woman.
She
can
counsel
you
when
you
need
counsel."
"For
your
part,
you
have
your
brother
Robert."
"For
any
right
hand
defections,
there
is
the
Rev.
Matthewson
Helstone,
M.A.,
to
lean
upon;
for
any
left
hand
fallings
off
there
is
Hiram
Yorke,
Esq.
Both
elders
pay
you
homage."
"I
never
saw
Mrs.
Yorke
so
motherly
to
any
young
man
as
she
is
to
you.
I
don't
know
how
you
have
won
her
heart,
but
she
is
more
tender
to
you
than
she
is
to
her
own
sons.
You
have,
besides,
your
sister
Hortense."
"It
appears
we
are
both
well
provided."
"It
appears
so."
"How
thankful
we
ought
to
be!"
"Yes."
"How
contented!"
"Yes."
"For
my
part,
I
am
almost
contented
just
now,
and
very
thankful.
Gratitude
is
a
divine
emotion.
It
fills
the
heart,
but
not
to
bursting;
it
warms
it,
but
not
to
fever.
I
like
to
taste
leisurely
of
bliss.
Devoured
in
haste,
I
do
not
know
its
flavour."
Still
leaning
on
the
back
of
Miss
Keeldar's
chair,
Moore
watched
the
rapid
motion
of
her
fingers,
as
the
green
and
purple
garland
grew
beneath
them.
After
a
prolonged
pause,
he
again
asked,
"Is
the
shadow
quite
gone?"
"Wholly.
As
I
was
two
hours
since,
and
as
I
am
now,
are
two
different
states
of
existence.
I
believe,
Mr.
Moore,
griefs
and
fears
nursed
in
silence
grow
like
Titan
infants."
"You
will
cherish
such
feelings
no
more
in
silence?"
"Not
if
I
dare
speak."
"In
using
the
word
'dare,'
to
whom
do
you
allude?"
"To
you."
"How
is
it
applicable
to
me?"
"On
account
of
your
austerity
and
shyness."
"Why
am
I
austere
and
shy?"
"Because
you
are
proud."
"Why
am
I
proud?"
"I
should
like
to
know.
Will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me?"
"Perhaps,
because
I
am
poor,
for
one
reason.
Poverty
and
pride
often
go
together."
"That
is
such
a
nice
reason.
I
should
be
charmed
to
discover
another
that
would
pair
with
it.
Mate
that
turtle,
Mr.
Moore."
"Immediately.
What
do
you
think
of
marrying
to
sober
Poverty
many
tinted
Caprice?"
"Are
you
capricious?"
"You
are."
"A
libel.
I
am
steady
as
a
rock,
fixed
as
the
polar
star."
"I
look
out
at
some
early
hour
of
the
day,
and
see
a
fine,
perfect
rainbow,
bright
with
promise,
gloriously
spanning
the
beclouded
welkin
of
life.
An
hour
afterwards
I
look
again:
half
the
arch
is
gone,
and
the
rest
is
faded.
Still
later,
the
stern
sky
denies
that
it
ever
wore
so
benign
a
symbol
of
hope."
"Well,
Mr.
Moore,
you
should
contend
against
these
changeful
humours.
They
are
your
besetting
sin.
One
never
knows
where
to
have
you."
"Miss
Keeldar,
I
had
once,
for
two
years,
a
pupil
who
grew
very
dear
to
me.
Henry
is
dear,
but
she
was
dearer.
Henry
never
gives
me
trouble;
she
well,
she
did.
I
think
she
vexed
me
twenty
three
hours
out
of
the
twenty
four
"
"She
was
never
with
you
above
three
hours,
or
at
the
most
six
at
a
time."
"She
sometimes
spilled
the
draught
from
my
cup,
and
stole
the
food
from
my
plate;
and
when
she
had
kept
me
unfed
for
a
day
(and
that
did
not
suit
me,
for
I
am
a
man
accustomed
to
take
my
meals
with
reasonable
relish,
and
to
ascribe
due
importance
to
the
rational
enjoyment
of
creature
comforts)
"
"I
know
you
do.
I
can
tell
what
sort
of
dinners
you
like
best
perfectly
well.
I
know
precisely
the
dishes
you
prefer
"
"She
robbed
these
dishes
of
flavour,
and
made
a
fool
of
me
besides.
I
like
to
sleep
well.
In
my
quiet
days,
when
I
was
my
own
man,
I
never
quarrelled
with
the
night
for
being
long,
nor
cursed
my
bed
for
its
thorns.
She
changed
all
this."
"Mr.
Moore
"
"And
having
taken
from
me
peace
of
mind
and
ease
of
life,
she
took
from
me
herself
quite
coolly,
just
as
if,
when
she
was
gone,
the
world
would
be
all
the
same
to
me.
I
knew
I
should
see
her
again
at
some
time.
At
the
end
of
two
years,
it
fell
out
that
we
encountered
again
under
her
own
roof,
where
she
was
mistress.
How
do
you
think
she
bore
herself
towards
me,
Miss
Keeldar?"
"Like
one
who
had
profited
well
by
lessons
learned
from
yourself."
"She
received
me
haughtily.
She
meted
out
a
wide
space
between
us,
and
kept
me
aloof
by
the
reserved
gesture,
the
rare
and
alienated
glance,
the
word
calmly
civil."
"She
was
an
excellent
pupil!
Having
seen
you
distant,
she
at
once
learned
to
withdraw.
Pray,
sir,
admire
in
her
hauteur
a
careful
improvement
on
your
own
coolness."
"Conscience,
and
honour,
and
the
most
despotic
necessity
dragged
me
apart
from
her,
and
kept
me
sundered
with
ponderous
fetters.
She
was
free:
she
might
have
been
clement."
"Never
free
to
compromise
her
self
respect,
to
seek
where
she
had
been
shunned."
"Then
she
was
inconsistent;
she
tantalized
as
before.
When
I
thought
I
had
made
up
my
mind
to
seeing
in
her
only
a
lofty
stranger,
she
would
suddenly
show
me
such
a
glimpse
of
loving
simplicity
she
would
warm
me
with
such
a
beam
of
reviving
sympathy,
she
would
gladden
an
hour
with
converse
so
gentle,
gay,
and
kindly
that
I
could
no
more
shut
my
heart
on
her
image
than
I
could
close
that
door
against
her
presence.
Explain
why
she
distressed
me
so."
"She
could
not
bear
to
be
quite
outcast;
and
then
she
would
sometimes
get
a
notion
into
her
head,
on
a
cold,
wet
day,
that
the
schoolroom
was
no
cheerful
place,
and
feel
it
incumbent
on
her
to
go
and
see
if
you
and
Henry
kept
up
a
good
fire;
and
once
there,
she
liked
to
stay."
"But
she
should
not
be
changeful.
If
she
came
at
all,
she
should
come
oftener."
"There
is
such
a
thing
as
intrusion."
"To
morrow
you
will
not
be
as
you
are
to
day."
"I
don't
know.
Will
you?"
"I
am
not
mad,
most
noble
Berenice!
We
may
give
one
day
to
dreaming,
but
the
next
we
must
awake;
and
I
shall
awake
to
purpose
the
morning
you
are
married
to
Sir
Philip
Nunnely.
The
fire
shines
on
you
and
me,
and
shows
us
very
clearly
in
the
glass,
Miss
Keeldar;
and
I
have
been
gazing
on
the
picture
all
the
time
I
have
been
talking.
Look
up!
What
a
difference
between
your
head
and
mine!
I
look
old
for
thirty!"
"You
are
so
grave;
you
have
such
a
square
brow;
and
your
face
is
sallow.
I
never
regard
you
as
a
young
man,
nor
as
Robert's
junior."
"Don't
you?
I
thought
not.
Imagine
Robert's
clear
cut,
handsome
face
looking
over
my
shoulder.
Does
not
the
apparition
make
vividly
manifest
the
obtuse
mould
of
my
heavy
traits?
There!"
(he
started),
"I
have
been
expecting
that
wire
to
vibrate
this
last
half
hour."
The
dinner
bell
rang,
and
Shirley
rose.
"Mr.
Moore,"
she
said,
as
she
gathered
up
her
silks,
"have
you
heard
from
your
brother
lately?
Do
you
know
what
he
means
by
staying
in
town
so
long?
Does
he
talk
of
returning?"
"He
talks
of
returning;
but
what
has
caused
his
long
absence
I
cannot
tell.
To
speak
the
truth,
I
thought
none
in
Yorkshire
knew
better
than
yourself
why
he
was
reluctant
to
come
home."
A
crimson
shadow
passed
across
Miss
Keeldar's
cheek.
"Write
to
him
and
urge
him
to
come,"
she
said.
"I
know
there
has
been
no
impolicy
in
protracting
his
absence
thus
far.
It
is
good
to
let
the
mill
stand,
while
trade
is
so
bad;
but
he
must
not
abandon
the
county."
"I
am
aware,"
said
Louis,
"that
he
had
an
interview
with
you
the
evening
before
he
left,
and
I
saw
him
quit
Fieldhead
afterwards.
I
read
his
countenance,
or
tried
to
read
it.
He
turned
from
me.
I
divined
that
he
would
be
long
away.
Some
fine,
slight
fingers
have
a
wondrous
knack
at
pulverizing
a
man's
brittle
pride.
I
suppose
Robert
put
too
much
trust
in
his
manly
beauty
and
native
gentlemanhood.
Those
are
better
off
who,
being
destitute
of
advantage,
cannot
cherish
delusion.
But
I
will
write,
and
say
you
advise
his
return."
"Do
not
say
I
advise
his
return,
but
that
his
return
is
advisable."
The
second
bell
rang,
and
Miss
Keeldar
obeyed
its
call.
Louis
Moore
was
used
to
a
quiet
life.
Being
a
quiet
man,
he
endured
it
better
than
most
men
would.
Having
a
large
world
of
his
own
in
his
own
head
and
heart,
he
tolerated
confinement
to
a
small,
still
corner
of
the
real
world
very
patiently.
How
hushed
is
Fieldhead
this
evening!
All
but
Moore
Miss
Keeldar,
the
whole
family
of
the
Sympsons,
even
Henry
are
gone
to
Nunnely.
Sir
Philip
would
have
them
come;
he
wished
to
make
them
acquainted
with
his
mother
and
sisters,
who
are
now
at
the
priory.
Kind
gentleman
as
the
baronet
is,
he
asked
the
tutor
too;
but
the
tutor
would
much
sooner
have
made
an
appointment
with
the
ghost
of
the
Earl
of
Huntingdon
to
meet
him,
and
a
shadowy
ring
of
his
merry
men,
under
the
canopy
of
the
thickest,
blackest,
oldest
oak
in
Nunnely
Forest.
Yes,
he
would
rather
have
appointed
tryst
with
a
phantom
abbess,
or
mist
pale
nun,
among
the
wet
and
weedy
relics
of
that
ruined
sanctuary
of
theirs,
mouldering
in
the
core
of
the
wood.
Louis
Moore
longs
to
have
something
near
him
to
night;
but
not
the
boy
baronet,
nor
his
benevolent
but
stern
mother,
nor
his
patrician
sisters,
nor
one
soul
of
the
Sympsons.
This
night
is
not
calm;
the
equinox
still
struggles
in
its
storms.
The
wild
rains
of
the
day
are
abated;
the
great
single
cloud
disparts
and
rolls
away
from
heaven,
not
passing
and
leaving
a
sea
all
sapphire,
but
tossed
buoyant
before
a
continued,
long
sounding,
high
rushing
moonlight
tempest.
The
moon
reigns
glorious,
glad
of
the
gale,
as
glad
as
if
she
gave
herself
to
his
fierce
caress
with
love.
No
Endymion
will
watch
for
his
goddess
to
night.
There
are
no
flocks
out
on
the
mountains;
and
it
is
well,
for
to
night
she
welcomes
eaolus.
Moore,
sitting
in
the
schoolroom,
heard
the
storm
roar
round
the
other
gable
and
along
the
hall
front.
This
end
was
sheltered.
He
wanted
no
shelter;
he
desired
no
subdued
sounds
or
screened
position.
"All
the
parlours
are
empty,"
said
he.
"I
am
sick
at
heart
of
this
cell."
He
left
it,
and
went
where
the
casements,
larger
and
freer
than
the
branch
screened
lattice
of
his
own
apartment,
admitted
unimpeded
the
dark
blue,
the
silver
fleeced,
the
stirring
and
sweeping
vision
of
the
autumn
night
sky.
He
carried
no
candle;
unneeded
was
lamp
or
fire.
The
broad
and
clear
though
cloud
crossed
and
fluctuating
beam
of
the
moon
shone
on
every
floor
and
wall.
Moore
wanders
through
all
the
rooms.
He
seems
following
a
phantom
from
parlour
to
parlour.
In
the
oak
room
he
stops.
This
is
not
chill,
and
polished,
and
fireless
like
the
salon.
The
hearth
is
hot
and
ruddy;
the
cinders
tinkle
in
the
intense
heat
of
their
clear
glow;
near
the
rug
is
a
little
work
table,
a
desk
upon
it,
a
chair
near
it.
Does
the
vision
Moore
has
tracked
occupy
that
chair?
You
would
think
so,
could
you
see
him
standing
before
it.
There
is
as
much
interest
now
in
his
eye,
and
as
much
significance
in
his
face,
as
if
in
this
household
solitude
he
had
found
a
living
companion,
and
was
going
to
speak
to
it.
He
makes
discoveries.
A
bag
a
small
satin
bag
hangs
on
the
chair
back.
The
desk
is
open,
the
keys
are
in
the
lock.
A
pretty
seal,
a
silver
pen,
a
crimson
berry
or
two
of
ripe
fruit
on
a
green
leaf,
a
small,
clean,
delicate
glove
these
trifles
at
once
decorate
and
disarrange
the
stand
they
strew.
Order
forbids
details
in
a
picture
she
puts
them
tidily
away;
but
details
give
charm.
Moore
spoke.
"Her
mark,"
he
said.
"Here
she
has
been
careless,
attractive
thing!
called
away
in
haste,
doubtless,
and
forgetting
to
return
and
put
all
to
rights.
Why
does
she
leave
fascination
in
her
footprints?
Whence
did
she
acquire
the
gift
to
be
heedless
and
never
offend?
There
is
always
something
to
chide
in
her,
and
the
reprimand
never
settles
in
displeasure
on
the
heart,
but,
for
her
lover
or
her
husband,
when
it
had
trickled
a
while
in
words,
would
naturally
melt
from
his
lips
in
a
kiss.
Better
pass
half
an
hour
in
remonstrating
with
her
than
a
day
in
admiring
or
praising
any
other
woman
alive.
Am
I
muttering?
soliloquizing?
Stop
that."
He
did
stop
it.
He
stood
thinking,
and
then
he
made
an
arrangement
for
his
evening's
comfort.
He
dropped
the
curtains
over
the
broad
window
and
regal
moon.
He
shut
out
sovereign
and
court
and
starry
armies;
he
added
fuel
to
the
hot
but
fast
wasting
fire;
he
lit
a
candle,
of
which
there
were
a
pair
on
the
table;
he
placed
another
chair
opposite
that
near
the
workstand;
and
then
he
sat
down.
His
next
movement
was
to
take
from
his
pocket
a
small,
thick
book
of
blank
paper,
to
produce
a
pencil,
and
to
begin
to
write
in
a
cramp,
compact
hand.
Come
near,
by
all
means,
reader.
Do
not
be
shy.
Stoop
over
his
shoulder
fearlessly,
and
read
as
he
scribbles.
"It
is
nine
o'clock;
the
carriage
will
not
return
before
eleven,
I
am
certain.
Freedom
is
mine
till
then;
till
then
I
may
occupy
her
room,
sit
opposite
her
chair,
rest
my
elbow
on
her
table,
have
her
little
mementoes
about
me.
"I
used
rather
to
like
Solitude
to
fancy
her
a
somewhat
quiet
and
serious,
yet
fair
nymph;
an
Oread,
descending
to
me
from
lone
mountain
passes,
something
of
the
blue
mist
of
hills
in
her
array
and
of
their
chill
breeze
in
her
breath,
but
much
also
of
their
solemn
beauty
in
her
mien.
I
once
could
court
her
serenely,
and
imagine
my
heart
easier
when
I
held
her
to
it
all
mute,
but
majestic.
"Since
that
day
I
called
S.
to
me
in
the
schoolroom,
and
she
came
and
sat
so
near
my
side;
since
she
opened
the
trouble
of
her
mind
to
me,
asked
my
protection,
appealed
to
my
strength
since
that
hour
I
abhor
Solitude.
Cold
abstraction,
fleshless
skeleton,
daughter,
mother,
and
mate
of
Death!
"It
is
pleasant
to
write
about
what
is
near
and
dear
as
the
core
of
my
heart.
None
can
deprive
me
of
this
little
book,
and
through
this
pencil
I
can
say
to
it
what
I
will
say
what
I
dare
utter
to
nothing
living
say
what
I
dare
not
think
aloud.
"We
have
scarcely
encountered
each
other
since
that
evening.
Once,
when
I
was
alone
in
the
drawing
room,
seeking
a
book
of
Henry's,
she
entered,
dressed
for
a
concert
at
Stilbro'.
Shyness
her
shyness,
not
mine
drew
a
silver
veil
between
us.
Much
cant
have
I
heard
and
read
about
'maiden
modesty,'
but,
properly
used,
and
not
hackneyed,
the
words
are
good
and
appropriate
words.
As
she
passed
to
the
window,
after
tacitly
but
gracefully
recognizing
me,
I
could
call
her
nothing
in
my
own
mind
save
'stainless
virgin.'
To
my
perception,
a
delicate
splendour
robed
her,
and
the
modesty
of
girlhood
was
her
halo.
I
may
be
the
most
fatuous,
as
I
am
one
of
the
plainest,
of
men,
but
in
truth
that
shyness
of
hers
touched
me
exquisitely;
it
flattered
my
finest
sensations.
I
looked
a
stupid
block,
I
dare
say.
I
was
alive
with
a
life
of
Paradise,
as
she
turned
her
glance
from
my
glance,
and
softly
averted
her
head
to
hide
the
suffusion
of
her
cheek.
"I
know
this
is
the
talk
of
a
dreamer
of
a
rapt,
romantic
lunatic.
I
do
dream.
I
will
dream
now
and
then;
and
if
she
has
inspired
romance
into
my
prosaic
composition,
how
can
I
help
it?
"What
a
child
she
is
sometimes!
What
an
unsophisticated,
untaught
thing!
I
see
her
now
looking
up
into
my
face,
and
entreating
me
to
prevent
them
from
smothering
her,
and
to
be
sure
and
give
her
a
strong
narcotic.
I
see
her
confessing
that
she
was
not
so
self
sufficing,
so
independent
of
sympathy,
as
people
thought.
I
see
the
secret
tear
drop
quietly
from
her
eyelash.
She
said
I
thought
her
childish,
and
I
did.
She
imagined
I
despised
her.
Despised
her!
It
was
unutterably
sweet
to
feel
myself
at
once
near
her
and
above
her
to
be
conscious
of
a
natural
right
and
power
to
sustain
her,
as
a
husband
should
sustain
his
wife.
"I
worship
her
perfections;
but
it
is
her
faults,
or
at
least
her
foibles,
that
bring
her
near
to
me,
that
nestle
her
to
my
heart,
that
fold
her
about
with
my
love,
and
that
for
a
most
selfish
but
deeply
natural
reason.
These
faults
are
the
steps
by
which
I
mount
to
ascendency
over
her.
If
she
rose
a
trimmed,
artificial
mound,
without
inequality,
what
vantage
would
she
offer
the
foot?
It
is
the
natural
hill,
with
its
mossy
breaks
and
hollows,
whose
slope
invites
ascent,
whose
summit
it
is
pleasure
to
gain.
"To
leave
metaphor.
It
delights
my
eye
to
look
on
her.
She
suits
me.
If
I
were
a
king
and
she
the
housemaid
that
swept
my
palace
stairs,
across
all
that
space
between
us
my
eye
would
recognize
her
qualities;
a
true
pulse
would
beat
for
her
in
my
heart,
though
an
unspanned
gulf
made
acquaintance
impossible.
If
I
were
a
gentleman,
and
she
waited
on
me
as
a
servant,
I
could
not
help
liking
that
Shirley.
Take
from
her
her
education;
take
her
ornaments,
her
sumptuous
dress,
all
extrinsic
advantages;
take
all
grace,
but
such
as
the
symmetry
of
her
form
renders
inevitable;
present
her
to
me
at
a
cottage
door,
in
a
stuff
gown;
let
her
offer
me
there
a
draught
of
water,
with
that
smile,
with
that
warm
good
will
with
which
she
now
dispenses
manorial
hospitality
I
should
like
her.
I
should
wish
to
stay
an
hour;
I
should
linger
to
talk
with
that
rustic.
I
should
not
feel
as
I
now
do;
I
should
find
in
her
nothing
divine;
but
whenever
I
met
the
young
peasant,
it
would
be
with
pleasure;
whenever
I
left
her,
it
would
be
with
regret.
"How
culpably
careless
in
her
to
leave
her
desk
open,
where
I
know
she
has
money!
In
the
lock
hang
the
keys
of
all
her
repositories,
of
her
very
jewel
casket.
There
is
a
purse
in
that
little
satin
bag;
I
see
the
tassel
of
silver
beads
hanging
out.
That
spectacle
would
provoke
my
brother
Robert.
All
her
little
failings
would,
I
know,
be
a
source
of
irritation
to
him.
If
they
vex
me
it
is
a
most
pleasurable
vexation.
I
delight
to
find
her
at
fault;
and
were
I
always
resident
with
her,
I
am
aware
she
would
be
no
niggard
in
thus
ministering
to
my
enjoyment.
She
would
just
give
me
something
to
do,
to
rectify
a
theme
for
my
tutor
lectures.
I
never
lecture
Henry,
never
feel
disposed
to
do
so.
If
he
does
wrong
and
that
is
very
seldom,
dear,
excellent
lad!
a
word
suffices.
Often
I
do
no
more
than
shake
my
head.
But
the
moment
her
minois
mutin
meets
my
eye,
expostulatory
words
crowd
to
my
lips.
From
a
taciturn
man
I
believe
she
would
transform
me
into
a
talker.
Whence
comes
the
delight
I
take
in
that
talk?
It
puzzles
myself
sometimes.
The
more
crane,
malin,
taquin
is
her
mood,
consequently
the
clearer
occasion
she
gives
me
for
disapprobation,
the
more
I
seek
her,
the
better
I
like
her.
She
is
never
wilder
than
when
equipped
in
her
habit
and
hat,
never
less
manageable
than
when
she
and
Zoe
come
in
fiery
from
a
race
with
the
wind
on
the
hills;
and
I
confess
it
to
this
mute
page
I
may
confess
it
I
have
waited
an
hour
in
the
court
for
the
chance
of
witnessing
her
return,
and
for
the
dearer
chance
of
receiving
her
in
my
arms
from
the
saddle.
I
have
noticed
(again
it
is
to
this
page
only
I
would
make
the
remark)
that
she
will
never
permit
any
man
but
myself
to
render
her
that
assistance.
I
have
seen
her
politely
decline
Sir
Philip
Nunnely's
aid.
She
is
always
mighty
gentle
with
her
young
baronet,
mighty
tender
for
his
feelings,
forsooth,
and
of
his
very
thin
skinned
amour
propre.
I
have
marked
her
haughtily
reject
Sam
Wynne's.
Now
I
know
my
heart
knows
it,
for
it
has
felt
it
that
she
resigns
herself
to
me
unreluctantly.
Is
she
conscious
how
my
strength
rejoices
to
serve
her?
I
myself
am
not
her
slave
I
declare
it
but
my
faculties
gather
to
her
beauty,
like
the
genii
to
the
glisten
of
the
lamp.
All
my
knowledge,
all
my
prudence,
all
my
calm,
and
all
my
power
stand
in
her
presence
humbly
waiting
a
task.
How
glad
they
are
when
a
mandate
comes!
What
joy
they
take
in
the
toils
she
assigns!
Does
she
know
it?
"I
have
called
her
careless.
It
is
remarkable
that
her
carelessness
never
compromises
her
refinement.
Indeed,
through
this
very
loophole
of
character,
the
reality,
depth,
genuineness
of
that
refinement
may
be
ascertained.
A
whole
garment
sometimes
covers
meagreness
and
malformation;
through
a
rent
sleeve
a
fair
round
arm
may
be
revealed.
I
have
seen
and
handled
many
of
her
possessions,
because
they
are
frequently
astray.
I
never
saw
anything
that
did
not
proclaim
the
lady
nothing
sordid,
nothing
soiled.
In
one
sense
she
is
as
scrupulous
as,
in
another,
she
is
unthinking.
As
a
peasant
girl,
she
would
go
ever
trim
and
cleanly.
Look
at
the
pure
kid
of
this
little
glove,
at
the
fresh,
unsullied
satin
of
the
bag.
"What
a
difference
there
is
between
S.
and
that
pearl
C.
H.!
Caroline,
I
fancy,
is
the
soul
of
conscientious
punctuality
and
nice
exactitude.
She
would
precisely
suit
the
domestic
habits
of
a
certain
fastidious
kinsman
of
mine
so
delicate,
dexterous,
quaint,
quick,
quiet
all
done
to
a
minute,
all
arranged
to
a
strawbreadth.
She
would
suit
Robert.
But
what
could
I
do
with
anything
so
nearly
faultless?
She
is
my
equal,
poor
as
myself.
She
is
certainly
pretty:
a
little
Raffaelle
head
hers
Raffaelle
in
feature,
quite
English
in
expression,
all
insular
grace
and
purity;
but
where
is
there
anything
to
alter,
anything
to
endure,
anything
to
reprimand,
to
be
anxious
about?
There
she
is,
a
lily
of
the
valley,
untinted,
needing
no
tint.
What
change
could
improve
her?
What
pencil
dare
to
paint?
My
sweetheart,
if
I
ever
have
one,
must
bear
nearer
affinity
to
the
rose
a
sweet,
lively
delight
guarded
with
prickly
peril.
My
wife,
if
I
ever
marry,
must
stir
my
great
frame
with
a
sting
now
and
then;
she
must
furnish
use
to
her
husband's
vast
mass
of
patience.
I
was
not
made
so
enduring
to
be
mated
with
a
lamb;
I
should
find
more
congenial
responsibility
in
the
charge
of
a
young
lioness
or
leopardess.
I
like
few
things
sweet
but
what
are
likewise
pungent
few
things
bright
but
what
are
likewise
hot.
I
like
the
summer
day,
whose
sun
makes
fruit
blush
and
corn
blanch.
Beauty
is
never
so
beautiful
as
when,
if
I
tease
it,
it
wreathes
back
on
me
with
spirit.
Fascination
is
never
so
imperial
as
when,
roused
and
half
ireful,
she
threatens
transformation
to
fierceness.
I
fear
I
should
tire
of
the
mute,
monotonous
innocence
of
the
lamb;
I
should
ere
long
feel
as
burdensome
the
nestling
dove
which
never
stirred
in
my
bosom;
but
my
patience
would
exult
in
stilling
the
flutterings
and
training
the
energies
of
the
restless
merlin.
In
managing
the
wild
instincts
of
the
scarce
manageable
bete
fauve
my
powers
would
revel.
"O
my
pupil!
O
Peri!
too
mutinous
for
heaven,
too
innocent
for
hell,
never
shall
I
do
more
than
see,
and
worship,
and
wish
for
thee.
Alas!
knowing
I
could
make
thee
happy,
will
it
be
my
doom
to
see
thee
possessed
by
those
who
have
not
that
power?
"However
kindly
the
hand,
if
it
is
feeble,
it
cannot
bend
Shirley;
and
she
must
be
bent.
It
cannot
curb
her;
and
she
must
be
curbed.
"Beware,
Sir
Philip
Nunnely!
I
never
see
you
walking
or
sitting
at
her
side,
and
observe
her
lips
compressed,
or
her
brow
knit,
in
resolute
endurance
of
some
trait
of
your
character
which
she
neither
admires
nor
likes,
in
determined
toleration
of
some
weakness
she
believes
atoned
for
by
a
virtue,
but
which
annoys
her
despite
that
belief;
I
never
mark
the
grave
glow
of
her
face,
the
unsmiling
sparkle
of
her
eye,
the
slight
recoil
of
her
whole
frame
when
you
draw
a
little
too
near,
and
gaze
a
little
too
expressively,
and
whisper
a
little
too
warmly
I
never
witness
these
things
but
I
think
of
the
fable
of
Semele
reversed.
"It
is
not
the
daughter
of
Cadmus
I
see,
nor
do
I
realize
her
fatal
longing
to
look
on
Jove
in
the
majesty
of
his
god
head.
It
is
a
priest
of
Juno
that
stands
before
me,
watching
late
and
lone
at
a
shrine
in
an
Argive
temple.
For
years
of
solitary
ministry
he
has
lived
on
dreams.
There
is
divine
madness
upon
him.
He
loves
the
idol
he
serves,
and
prays
day
and
night
that
his
frenzy
may
be
fed,
and
that
the
Ox
eyed
may
smile
on
her
votary.
She
has
heard;
she
will
be
propitious.
All
Argos
slumbers.
The
doors
of
the
temple
are
shut;
the
priest
waits
at
the
altar.
"A
shock
of
heaven
and
earth
is
felt
not
by
the
slumbering
city,
only
by
that
lonely
watcher,
brave
and
unshaken
in
his
fanaticism.
In
the
midst
of
silence,
with
no
preluding
sound,
he
is
wrapped
in
sudden
light.
Through
the
roof,
through
the
rent,
wide
yawning,
vast,
white
blazing
blue
of
heaven
above,
pours
a
wondrous
descent,
dread
as
the
downrushing
of
stars.
He
has
what
he
asked.
Withdraw
forbear
to
look
I
am
blinded.
I
hear
in
that
fane
an
unspeakable
sound.
Would
that
I
could
not
hear
it!
I
see
an
insufferable
glory
burning
terribly
between
the
pillars.
Gods
be
merciful
and
quench
it!
"A
pious
Argive
enters
to
make
an
early
offering
in
the
cool
dawn
of
morning.
There
was
thunder
in
the
night;
the
bolt
fell
here.
The
shrine
is
shivered,
the
marble
pavement
round
split
and
blackened.
Saturnia's
statue
rises
chaste,
grand,
untouched;
at
her
feet
piled
ashes
lie
pale.
No
priest
remains;
he
who
watched
will
be
seen
no
more.
"There
is
the
carriage!
Let
me
lock
up
the
desk
and
pocket
the
keys.
She
will
be
seeking
them
to
morrow;
she
will
have
to
come
to
me.
I
hear
her:
'Mr.
Moore,
have
you
seen
my
keys?'
"So
she
will
say,
in
her
clear
voice,
speaking
with
reluctance,
looking
ashamed,
conscious
that
this
is
the
twentieth
time
of
asking.
I
will
tantalize
her,
keep
her
with
me,
expecting,
doubting;
and
when
I
do
restore
them,
it
shall
not
be
without
a
lecture.
Here
is
the
bag,
too,
and
the
purse;
the
glove
pen
seal.
She
shall
wring
them
all
out
of
me
slowly
and
separately
only
by
confession,
penitence,
entreaty.
I
never
can
touch
her
hand,
or
a
ringlet
of
her
head,
or
a
ribbon
of
her
dress,
but
I
will
make
privileges
for
myself.
Every
feature
of
her
face,
her
bright
eyes,
her
lips,
shall
go
through
each
change
they
know,
for
my
pleasure
display
each
exquisite
variety
of
glance
and
curve,
to
delight,
thrill,
perhaps
more
hopelessly
to
enchain
me.
If
I
must
be
her
slave,
I
will
not
lose
my
freedom
for
nothing."
He
locked
the
desk,
pocketed
all
the
property,
and
went.
Everybody
said
it
was
high
time
for
Mr.
Moore
to
return
home.
All
Briarfield
wondered
at
his
strange
absence,
and
Whinbury
and
Nunnely
brought
each
its
separate
contribution
of
amazement.
Was
it
known
why
he
stayed
away?
Yes.
It
was
known
twenty
forty
times
over,
there
being
at
least
forty
plausible
reasons
adduced
to
account
for
the
unaccountable
circumstance.
Business
it
was
not
that
the
gossips
agreed.
He
had
achieved
the
business
on
which
he
departed
long
ago.
His
four
ringleaders
he
had
soon
scented
out
and
run
down.
He
had
attended
their
trial,
heard
their
conviction
and
sentence,
and
seen
them
safely
shipped
prior
to
transportation.
This
was
known
at
Briarfield.
The
newspapers
had
reported
it.
The
Stilbro'
Courier
had
given
every
particular,
with
amplifications.
None
applauded
his
perseverance
or
hailed
his
success,
though
the
mill
owners
were
glad
of
it,
trusting
that
the
terrors
of
law
vindicated
would
henceforward
paralyze
the
sinister
valour
of
disaffection.
Disaffection,
however,
was
still
heard
muttering
to
himself.
He
swore
ominous
oaths
over
the
drugged
beer
of
alehouses,
and
drank
strange
toasts
in
fiery
British
gin.
One
report
affirmed
that
Moore
dared
not
come
to
Yorkshire;
he
knew
his
life
was
not
worth
an
hour's
purchase
if
he
did.
"I'll
tell
him
that,"
said
Mr.
Yorke,
when
his
foreman
mentioned
the
rumour;
"and
if
that
does
not
bring
him
home
full
gallop,
nothing
will."
Either
that
or
some
other
motive
prevailed
at
last
to
recall
him.
He
announced
to
Joe
Scott
the
day
he
should
arrive
at
Stilbro',
desiring
his
hackney
to
be
sent
to
the
George
for
his
accommodation;
and
Joe
Scott
having
informed
Mr.
Yorke,
that
gentleman
made
it
in
his
way
to
meet
him.
It
was
market
day.
Moore
arrived
in
time
to
take
his
usual
place
at
the
market
dinner.
As
something
of
a
stranger,
and
as
a
man
of
note
and
action,
the
assembled
manufacturers
received
him
with
a
certain
distinction.
Some,
who
in
public
would
scarcely
have
dared
to
acknowledge
his
acquaintance,
lest
a
little
of
the
hate
and
vengeance
laid
up
in
store
for
him
should
perchance
have
fallen
on
them,
in
private
hailed
him
as
in
some
sort
their
champion.
When
the
wine
had
circulated,
their
respect
would
have
kindled
to
enthusiasm
had
not
Moore's
unshaken
nonchalance
held
it
in
a
damp,
low,
smouldering
state.
Mr.
Yorke,
the
permanent
president
of
these
dinners,
witnessed
his
young
friend's
bearing
with
exceeding
complacency.
If
one
thing
could
stir
his
temper
or
excite
his
contempt
more
than
another,
it
was
to
see
a
man
befooled
by
flattery
or
elate
with
popularity.
If
one
thing
smoothed,
soothed,
and
charmed
him
especially,
it
was
the
spectacle
of
a
public
character
incapable
of
relishing
his
publicity
incapable,
I
say.
Disdain
would
but
have
incensed;
it
was
indifference
that
appeased
his
rough
spirit.
Robert,
leaning
back
in
his
chair,
quiet
and
almost
surly,
while
the
clothiers
and
blanket
makers
vaunted
his
prowess
and
rehearsed
his
deeds
many
of
them
interspersing
their
flatteries
with
coarse
invectives
against
the
operative
class
was
a
delectable
sight
for
Mr.
Yorke.
His
heart
tingled
with
the
pleasing
conviction
that
these
gross
eulogiums
shamed
Moore
deeply,
and
made
him
half
scorn
himself
and
his
work.
On
abuse,
on
reproach,
on
calumny,
it
is
easy
to
smile;
but
painful
indeed
is
the
panegyric
of
those
we
contemn.
Often
had
Moore
gazed
with
a
brilliant
countenance
over
howling
crowds
from
a
hostile
hustings.
He
had
breasted
the
storm
of
unpopularity
with
gallant
bearing
and
soul
elate;
but
he
drooped
his
head
under
the
half
bred
tradesmen's
praise,
and
shrank
chagrined
before
their
congratulations.
Yorke
could
not
help
asking
him
how
he
liked
his
supporters,
and
whether
he
did
not
think
they
did
honour
to
his
cause.
"But
it
is
a
pity,
lad,"
he
added,
"that
you
did
not
hang
these
four
samples
of
the
unwashed.
If
you
had
managed
that
feat,
the
gentry
here
would
have
riven
the
horses
out
of
the
coach,
yoked
to
a
score
of
asses,
and
drawn
you
into
Stilbro'
like
a
conquering
general."
Moore
soon
forsook
the
wine,
broke
from
the
party,
and
took
the
road.
In
less
than
five
minutes
Mr.
Yorke
followed
him.
They
rode
out
of
Stilbro'
together.
It
was
early
to
go
home,
but
yet
it
was
late
in
the
day.
The
last
ray
of
the
sun
had
already
faded
from
the
cloud
edges,
and
the
October
night
was
casting
over
the
moorlands
the
shadow
of
her
approach.
Mr.
Yorke,
moderately
exhilarated
with
his
moderate
libations,
and
not
displeased
to
see
young
Moore
again
in
Yorkshire,
and
to
have
him
for
his
comrade
during
the
long
ride
home,
took
the
discourse
much
to
himself.
He
touched
briefly,
but
scoffingly,
on
the
trials
and
the
conviction;
he
passed
thence
to
the
gossip
of
the
neighbourhood,
and
ere
long
he
attacked
Moore
on
his
own
personal
concerns.
"Bob,
I
believe
you
are
worsted,
and
you
deserve
it.
All
was
smooth.
Fortune
had
fallen
in
love
with
you.
She
had
decreed
you
the
first
prize
in
her
wheel
twenty
thousand
pounds;
she
only
required
that
you
should
hold
your
hand
out
and
take
it.
And
what
did
you
do?
You
called
for
a
horse
and
rode
a
hunting
to
Warwickshire.
Your
sweetheart
Fortune,
I
mean
was
perfectly
indulgent.
She
said,
'I'll
excuse
him;
he's
young.'
She
waited,
like
'Patience
on
a
monument,'
till
the
chase
was
over
and
the
vermin
prey
run
down.
She
expected
you
would
come
back
then,
and
be
a
good
lad.
You
might
still
have
had
her
first
prize.
"It
capped
her
beyond
expression,
and
me
too,
to
find
that,
instead
of
thundering
home
in
a
breakneck
gallop
and
laying
your
assize
laurels
at
her
feet,
you
coolly
took
coach
up
to
London.
What
you
have
done
there
Satan
knows;
nothing
in
this
world,
I
believe,
but
sat
and
sulked.
Your
face
was
never
lily
fair,
but
it
is
olive
green
now.
You're
not
as
bonny
as
you
were,
man."
"And
who
is
to
have
this
prize
you
talk
so
much
about?"
"Only
a
baronet;
that
is
all.
I
have
not
a
doubt
in
my
own
mind
you've
lost
her.
She
will
be
Lady
Nunnely
before
Christmas."
"Hem!
Quite
probable."
"But
she
need
not
to
have
been.
Fool
of
a
lad!
I
swear
you
might
have
had
her."
"By
what
token,
Mr.
Yorke?"
"By
every
token
by
the
light
of
her
eyes,
the
red
of
her
cheeks.
Red
they
grew
when
your
name
was
mentioned,
though
of
custom
they
are
pale."
"My
chance
is
quite
over,
I
suppose?"
"It
ought
to
be.
But
try;
it
is
worth
trying.
I
call
this
Sir
Philip
milk
and
water.
And
then
he
writes
verses,
they
say
tags
rhymes.
You
are
above
that,
Bob,
at
all
events."
"Would
you
advise
me
to
propose,
late
as
it
is,
Mr.
Yorke
at
the
eleventh
hour?"
"You
can
but
make
the
experiment,
Robert.
If
she
has
a
fancy
for
you
and,
on
my
conscience,
I
believe
she
has
or
had
she
will
forgive
much.
But,
my
lad,
you
are
laughing.
Is
it
at
me?
You
had
better
grin
at
your
own
perverseness.
I
see,
however,
you
laugh
at
the
wrong
side
of
your
mouth.
You
have
as
sour
a
look
at
this
moment
as
one
need
wish
to
see."
"I
have
so
quarrelled
with
myself,
Yorke.
I
have
so
kicked
against
the
pricks,
and
struggled
in
a
strait
waistcoat,
and
dislocated
my
wrists
with
wrenching
them
in
handcuffs,
and
battered
my
hard
head
by
driving
it
against
a
harder
wall."
"Ha!
I'm
glad
to
hear
that.
Sharp
exercise
yon!
I
hope
it
has
done
you
good
ta'en
some
of
the
self
conceit
out
of
you?"
"Self
conceit?
What
is
it?
Self
respect,
self
tolerance
even,
what
are
they?
Do
you
sell
the
articles?
Do
you
know
anybody
who
does?
Give
an
indication.
They
would
find
in
me
a
liberal
chapman.
I
would
part
with
my
last
guinea
this
minute
to
buy."
"Is
it
so
with
you,
Robert?
I
find
that
spicy.
I
like
a
man
to
speak
his
mind.
What
has
gone
wrong?"
"The
machinery
of
all
my
nature;
the
whole
enginery
of
this
human
mill;
the
boiler,
which
I
take
to
be
the
heart,
is
fit
to
burst."
"That
suld
be
putten
i'
print;
it's
striking.
It's
almost
blank
verse.
Ye'll
be
jingling
into
poetry
just
e'now.
If
the
afflatus
comes,
give
way,
Robert.
Never
heed
me;
I'll
bear
it
this
whet
[time]."
"Hideous,
abhorrent,
base
blunder!
You
may
commit
in
a
moment
what
you
will
rue
for
years
what
life
cannot
cancel."
"Lad,
go
on.
I
call
it
pie,
nuts,
sugar
candy.
I
like
the
taste
uncommonly.
Go
on.
It
will
do
you
good
to
talk.
The
moor
is
before
us
now,
and
there
is
no
life
for
many
a
mile
round."
"I
will
talk.
I
am
not
ashamed
to
tell.
There
is
a
sort
of
wild
cat
in
my
breast,
and
I
choose
that
you
shall
hear
how
it
can
yell."
"To
me
it
is
music.
What
grand
voices
you
and
Louis
have!
When
Louis
sings
tones
off
like
a
soft,
deep
bell
I've
felt
myself
tremble
again.
The
night
is
still.
It
listens.
It
is
just
leaning
down
to
you,
like
a
black
priest
to
a
blacker
penitent.
Confess,
lad.
Smooth
naught
down.
Be
candid
as
a
convicted,
justified,
sanctified
Methody
at
an
experience
meeting.
Make
yourself
as
wicked
as
Beelzebub.
It
will
ease
your
mind."
"As
mean
as
Mammon,
you
would
say.
Yorke,
if
I
got
off
horseback
and
laid
myself
down
across
the
road,
would
you
have
the
goodness
to
gallop
over
me,
backwards
and
forwards,
about
twenty
times?"
"Wi'
all
the
pleasure
in
life,
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
a
coroner's
inquest."
"Hiram
Yorke,
I
certainly
believed
she
loved
me.
I
have
seen
her
eyes
sparkle
radiantly
when
she
has
found
me
out
in
a
crowd;
she
has
flushed
up
crimson
when
she
has
offered
me
her
hand,
and
said,
'How
do
you
do,
Mr.
Moore?'
"My
name
had
a
magical
influence
over
her.
When
others
uttered
it
she
changed
countenance
I
know
she
did.
She
pronounced
it
herself
in
the
most
musical
of
her
many
musical
tones.
She
was
cordial
to
me;
she
took
an
interest
in
me;
she
was
anxious
about
me;
she
wished
me
well;
she
sought,
she
seized
every
opportunity
to
benefit
me.
I
considered,
paused,
watched,
weighed,
wondered.
I
could
come
to
but
one
conclusion
this
is
love.
"I
looked
at
her,
Yorke.
I
saw
in
her
youth
and
a
species
of
beauty.
I
saw
power
in
her.
Her
wealth
offered
me
the
redemption
of
my
honour
and
my
standing.
I
owed
her
gratitude.
She
had
aided
me
substantially
and
effectually
by
a
loan
of
five
thousand
pounds.
Could
I
remember
these
things?
Could
I
believe
she
loved
me?
Could
I
hear
wisdom
urge
me
to
marry
her,
and
disregard
every
dear
advantage,
disbelieve
every
flattering
suggestion,
disdain
every
well
weighed
counsel,
turn
and
leave
her?
Young,
graceful,
gracious
my
benefactress,
attached
to
me,
enamoured
of
me.
I
used
to
say
so
to
myself;
dwell
on
the
word;
mouth
it
over
and
over
again;
swell
over
it
with
a
pleasant,
pompous
complacency,
with
an
admiration
dedicated
entirely
to
myself,
and
unimpaired
even
by
esteem
for
her;
indeed
I
smiled
in
deep
secrecy
at
her
naivete
and
simplicity
in
being
the
first
to
love,
and
to
show
it.
That
whip
of
yours
seems
to
have
a
good
heavy
handle,
Yorke;
you
can
swing
it
about
your
head
and
knock
me
out
of
the
saddle,
if
you
choose.
I
should
rather
relish
a
loundering
whack."
"Tak
patience,
Robert,
till
the
moon
rises
and
I
can
see
you.
Speak
plain
out
did
you
love
her
or
not?
I
could
like
to
know.
I
feel
curious."
"Sir
sir
I
say
she
is
very
pretty,
in
her
own
style,
and
very
attractive.
She
has
a
look,
at
times,
of
a
thing
made
out
of
fire
and
air,
at
which
I
stand
and
marvel,
without
a
thought
of
clasping
and
kissing
it.
I
felt
in
her
a
powerful
magnet
to
my
interest
and
vanity.
I
never
felt
as
if
nature
meant
her
to
be
my
other
and
better
self.
When
a
question
on
that
head
rushed
upon
me,
I
flung
it
off,
saying
brutally
I
should
be
rich
with
her
and
ruined
without
her
vowing
I
would
be
practical,
and
not
romantic."
"A
very
sensible
resolve.
What
mischief
came
of
it,
Bob?"
"With
this
sensible
resolve
I
walked
up
to
Fieldhead
one
night
last
August.
It
was
the
very
eve
of
my
departure
for
Birmingham;
for,
you
see,
I
wanted
to
secure
Fortune's
splendid
prize.
I
had
previously
dispatched
a
note
requesting
a
private
interview.
I
found
her
at
home,
and
alone.
"She
received
me
without
embarrassment,
for
she
thought
I
came
on
business.
I
was
embarrassed
enough,
but
determined.
I
hardly
know
how
I
got
the
operation
over;
but
I
went
to
work
in
a
hard,
firm
fashion
frightful
enough,
I
dare
say.
I
sternly
offered
myself
my
fine
person
with
my
debts,
of
course,
as
a
settlement.
"It
vexed
me,
it
kindled
my
ire,
to
find
that
she
neither
blushed,
trembled,
nor
looked
down.
She
responded,
'I
doubt
whether
I
have
understood
you,
Mr.
Moore.'
"And
I
had
to
go
over
the
whole
proposal
twice,
and
word
it
as
plainly
as
A
B
C,
before
she
would
fully
take
it
in.
And
then,
what
did
she
do?
Instead
of
faltering
a
sweet
Yes,
or
maintaining
a
soft,
confused
silence
(which
would
have
been
as
good),
she
started
up,
walked
twice
fast
through
the
room,
in
the
way
that
she
only
does,
and
no
other
woman,
and
ejaculated,
'God
bless
me!'
"Yorke,
I
stood
on
the
hearth,
backed
by
the
mantelpiece;
against
it
I
leaned,
and
prepared
for
anything
everything.
I
knew
my
doom,
and
I
knew
myself.
There
was
no
misunderstanding
her
aspect
and
voice.
She
stopped
and
looked
at
me.
"'God
bless
me!'
she
piteously
repeated,
in
that
shocked,
indignant,
yet
saddened
accent.
'You
have
made
a
strange
proposal
strange
from
you;
and
if
you
knew
how
strangely
you
worded
it
and
looked
it,
you
would
be
startled
at
yourself.
You
spoke
like
a
brigand
who
demanded
my
purse
rather
than
like
a
lover
who
asked
my
heart.'
"A
queer
sentence,
was
it
not,
Yorke?
And
I
knew,
as
she
uttered
it,
it
was
true
as
queer.
Her
words
were
a
mirror
in
which
I
saw
myself.
"I
looked
at
her,
dumb
and
wolfish.
She
at
once
enraged
and
shamed
me.
"'Gerard
Moore,
you
know
you
don't
love
Shirley
Keeldar.'
I
might
have
broken
out
into
false
swearing
vowed
that
I
did
love
her;
but
I
could
not
lie
in
her
pure
face.
I
could
not
perjure
myself
in
her
truthful
presence.
Besides,
such
hollow
oaths
would
have
been
vain
as
void.
She
would
no
more
have
believed
me
than
she
would
have
believed
the
ghost
of
Judas,
had
he
broken
from
the
night
and
stood
before
her.
Her
female
heart
had
finer
perceptions
than
to
be
cheated
into
mistaking
my
half
coarse,
half
cold
admiration
for
true
throbbing,
manly
love.
"What
next
happened?
you
will
say,
Mr.
Yorke.
"Why,
she
sat
down
in
the
window
seat
and
cried.
She
cried
passionately.
Her
eyes
not
only
rained
but
lightened.
They
flashed,
open,
large,
dark,
haughty,
upon
me.
They
said,
'You
have
pained
me;
you
have
outraged
me;
you
have
deceived
me.'
"She
added
words
soon
to
looks.
"'I
did
respect
I
did
admire
I
did
like
you,'
she
said
'yes,
as
much
as
if
you
were
my
brother;
and
you
you
want
to
make
a
speculation
of
me.
You
would
immolate
me
to
that
mill,
your
Moloch!'
"I
had
the
common
sense
to
abstain
from
any
word
of
excuse,
any
attempt
at
palliation.
I
stood
to
be
scorned.
"Sold
to
the
devil
for
the
time
being,
I
was
certainly
infatuated.
When
I
did
speak,
what
do
you
think
I
said?
"'Whatever
my
own
feelings
were,
I
was
persuaded
you
loved
me,
Miss
Keeldar.'
"Beautiful,
was
it
not?
She
sat
quite
confounded.
'Is
it
Robert
Moore
that
speaks?'
I
heard
her
mutter.
'Is
it
a
man
or
something
lower?'
"'Do
you
mean,'
she
asked
aloud
'do
you
mean
you
thought
I
loved
you
as
we
love
those
we
wish
to
marry?'
"It
was
my
meaning,
and
I
said
so.
"'You
conceived
an
idea
obnoxious
to
a
woman's
feelings,'
was
her
answer.
'You
have
announced
it
in
a
fashion
revolting
to
a
woman's
soul.
You
insinuate
that
all
the
frank
kindness
I
have
shown
you
has
been
a
complicated,
a
bold,
and
an
immodest
maneauvre
to
ensnare
a
husband.
You
imply
that
at
last
you
come
here
out
of
pity
to
offer
me
your
hand,
because
I
have
courted
you.
Let
me
say
this:
Your
sight
is
jaundiced;
you
have
seen
wrong.
Your
mind
is
warped;
you
have
judged
wrong.
Your
tongue
betrays
you;
you
now
speak
wrong.
I
never
loved
you.
Be
at
rest
there.
My
heart
is
as
pure
of
passion
for
you
as
yours
is
barren
of
affection
for
me.'
"I
hope
I
was
answered,
Yorke?
"'I
seem
to
be
a
blind,
besotted
sort
of
person,'
was
my
remark.
"'Loved
you!'
she
cried.
'Why,
I
have
been
as
frank
with
you
as
a
sister
never
shunned
you,
never
feared
you.
You
cannot,'
she
affirmed
triumphantly
'you
cannot
make
me
tremble
with
your
coming,
nor
accelerate
my
pulse
by
your
influence.'
"I
alleged
that
often,
when
she
spoke
to
me,
she
blushed,
and
that
the
sound
of
my
name
moved
her.
"'Not
for
your
sake!'
she
declared
briefly.
I
urged
explanation,
but
could
get
none.
"'When
I
sat
beside
you
at
the
school
feast,
did
you
think
I
loved
you
then?
When
I
stopped
you
in
Maythorn
Lane,
did
you
think
I
loved
you
then?
When
I
called
on
you
in
the
counting
house,
when
I
walked
with
you
on
the
pavement,
did
you
think
I
loved
you
then?'
"So
she
questioned
me;
and
I
said
I
did.
"By
the
Lord!
Yorke,
she
rose,
she
grew
tall,
she
expanded
and
refined
almost
to
flame.
There
was
a
trembling
all
through
her,
as
in
live
coal
when
its
vivid
vermilion
is
hottest.
"'That
is
to
say
that
you
have
the
worst
opinion
of
me;
that
you
deny
me
the
possession
of
all
I
value
most.
That
is
to
say
that
I
am
a
traitor
to
all
my
sisters;
that
I
have
acted
as
no
woman
can
act
without
degrading
herself
and
her
sex;
that
I
have
sought
where
the
incorrupt
of
my
kind
naturally
scorn
and
abhor
to
seek.'
She
and
I
were
silent
for
many
a
minute.
'Lucifer,
Star
of
the
Morning,'
she
went
on,
'thou
art
fallen!
You,
once
high
in
my
esteem,
are
hurled
down;
you,
once
intimate
in
my
friendship,
are
cast
out.
Go!'
"I
went
not.
I
had
heard
her
voice
tremble,
seen
her
lip
quiver.
I
knew
another
storm
of
tears
would
fall,
and
then
I
believed
some
calm
and
some
sunshine
must
come,
and
I
would
wait
for
it.
"As
fast,
but
more
quietly
than
before,
the
warm
rain
streamed
down.
There
was
another
sound
in
her
weeping
a
softer,
more
regretful
sound.
While
I
watched,
her
eyes
lifted
to
me
a
gaze
more
reproachful
than
haughty,
more
mournful
than
incensed.
"'O
Moore!'
said
she.
It
was
worse
than
'Et
tu,
Brute!'
"I
relieved
myself
by
what
should
have
been
a
sigh,
but
it
became
a
groan.
A
sense
of
Cain
like
desolation
made
my
breast
ache.
"'There
has
been
error
in
what
I
have
done,'
I
said,
'and
it
has
won
me
bitter
wages,
which
I
will
go
and
spend
far
from
her
who
gave
them.'
"I
took
my
hat.
All
the
time
I
could
not
have
borne
to
depart
so,
and
I
believed
she
would
not
let
me.
Nor
would
she
but
for
the
mortal
pang
I
had
given
her
pride,
that
cowed
her
compassion
and
kept
her
silent.
"I
was
obliged
to
turn
back
of
my
own
accord
when
I
reached
the
door,
to
approach
her,
and
to
say,
'Forgive
me.'
"'I
could,
if
there
was
not
myself
to
forgive
too,'
was
her
reply;
'but
to
mislead
a
sagacious
man
so
far
I
must
have
done
wrong.'
"I
broke
out
suddenly
with
some
declamation
I
do
not
remember.
I
know
that
it
was
sincere,
and
that
my
wish
and
aim
were
to
absolve
her
to
herself.
In
fact,
in
her
case
self
accusation
was
a
chimera.
"At
last
she
extended
her
hand.
For
the
first
time
I
wished
to
take
her
in
my
arms
and
kiss
her.
I
did
kiss
her
hand
many
times.
"'Some
day
we
shall
be
friends
again,'
she
said,
'when
you
have
had
time
to
read
my
actions
and
motives
in
a
true
light,
and
not
so
horribly
to
misinterpret
them.
Time
may
give
you
the
right
key
to
all.
Then,
perhaps,
you
will
comprehend
me,
and
then
we
shall
be
reconciled.'
"Farewell
drops
rolled
slow
down
her
cheeks.
She
wiped
them
away.
"'I
am
sorry
for
what
has
happened
deeply
sorry,'
she
sobbed.
So
was
I,
God
knows!
Thus
were
we
severed."
"A
queer
tale!"
commented
Mr.
Yorke.
"I'll
do
it
no
more,"
vowed
his
companion;
"never
more
will
I
mention
marriage
to
a
woman
unless
I
feel
love.
Henceforth
credit
and
commerce
may
take
care
of
themselves.
Bankruptcy
may
come
when
it
lists.
I
have
done
with
slavish
fear
of
disaster.
I
mean
to
work
diligently,
wait
patiently,
bear
steadily.
Let
the
worst
come,
I
will
take
my
axe
and
an
emigrant's
berth,
and
go
out
with
Louis
to
the
West;
he
and
I
have
settled
it.
No
woman
shall
ever
again
look
at
me
as
Miss
Keeldar
looked,
ever
again
feel
towards
me
as
Miss
Keeldar
felt.
In
no
woman's
presence
will
I
ever
again
stand
at
once
such
a
fool
and
such
a
knave,
such
a
brute
and
such
a
puppy."
"Tut!"
said
the
imperturbable
Yorke,
"you
make
too
much
of
it;
but
still,
I
say,
I
am
capped.
Firstly,
that
she
did
not
love
you;
and
secondly,
that
you
did
not
love
her.
You
are
both
young;
you
are
both
handsome;
you
are
both
well
enough
for
wit
and
even
for
temper
take
you
on
the
right
side.
What
ailed
you
that
you
could
not
agree?"
"We
never
have
been,
never
could
be
at
home
with
each
other,
Yorke.
Admire
each
other
as
we
might
at
a
distance,
still
we
jarred
when
we
came
very
near.
I
have
sat
at
one
side
of
a
room
and
observed
her
at
the
other,
perhaps
in
an
excited,
genial
moment,
when
she
had
some
of
her
favourites
round
her
her
old
beaux,
for
instance,
yourself
and
Helstone,
with
whom
she
is
so
playful,
pleasant,
and
eloquent.
I
have
watched
her
when
she
was
most
natural,
most
lively,
and
most
lovely;
my
judgment
has
pronounced
her
beautiful.
Beautiful
she
is
at
times,
when
her
mood
and
her
array
partake
of
the
splendid.
I
have
drawn
a
little
nearer,
feeling
that
our
terms
of
acquaintance
gave
me
the
right
of
approach.
I
have
joined
the
circle
round
her
seat,
caught
her
eye,
and
mastered
her
attention;
then
we
have
conversed;
and
others,
thinking
me,
perhaps,
peculiarly
privileged,
have
withdrawn
by
degrees,
and
left
us
alone.
Were
we
happy
thus
left?
For
myself,
I
must
say
No.
Always
a
feeling
of
constraint
came
over
me;
always
I
was
disposed
to
be
stern
and
strange.
We
talked
politics
and
business.
No
soft
sense
of
domestic
intimacy
ever
opened
our
hearts,
or
thawed
our
language
and
made
it
flow
easy
and
limpid.
If
we
had
confidences,
they
were
confidences
of
the
counting
house,
not
of
the
heart.
Nothing
in
her
cherished
affection
in
me,
made
me
better,
gentler;
she
only
stirred
my
brain
and
whetted
my
acuteness.
She
never
crept
into
my
heart
or
influenced
its
pulse;
and
for
this
good
reason,
no
doubt,
because
I
had
not
the
secret
of
making
her
love
me."
"Well,
lad,
it
is
a
queer
thing.
I
might
laugh
at
thee,
and
reckon
to
despise
thy
refinements;
but
as
it
is
dark
night
and
we
are
by
ourselves,
I
don't
mind
telling
thee
that
thy
talk
brings
back
a
glimpse
of
my
own
past
life.
Twenty
five
years
ago
I
tried
to
persuade
a
beautiful
woman
to
love
me,
and
she
would
not.
I
had
not
the
key
to
her
nature;
she
was
a
stone
wall
to
me,
doorless
and
windowless."
"But
you
loved
her,
Yorke;
you
worshipped
Mary
Cave.
Your
conduct,
after
all,
was
that
of
a
man
never
of
a
fortune
hunter."
"Ay,
I
did
love
her;
but
then
she
was
beautiful
as
the
moon
we
do
not
see
to
night.
There
is
naught
like
her
in
these
days.
Miss
Helstone,
maybe,
has
a
look
of
her,
but
nobody
else."
"Who
has
a
look
of
her?"
"That
black
coated
tyrant's
niece
that
quiet,
delicate
Miss
Helstone.
Many
a
time
I
have
put
on
my
spectacles
to
look
at
the
lassie
in
church,
because
she
has
gentle
blue
een,
wi'
long
lashes;
and
when
she
sits
in
shadow,
and
is
very
still
and
very
pale,
and
is,
happen,
about
to
fall
asleep
wi'
the
length
of
the
sermon
and
the
heat
of
the
biggin',
she
is
as
like
one
of
Canova's
marbles
as
aught
else."
"Was
Mary
Cave
in
that
style?"
"Far
grander!
less
lass
like
and
flesh
like.
You
wondered
why
she
hadn't
wings
and
a
crown.
She
was
a
stately,
peaceful
angel
was
my
Mary."
"And
you
could
not
persuade
her
to
love
you?"
"Not
with
all
I
could
do,
though
I
prayed
Heaven
many
a
time,
on
my
bended
knees,
to
help
me."
"Mary
Cave
was
not
what
you
think
her,
Yorke.
I
have
seen
her
picture
at
the
rectory.
She
is
no
angel,
but
a
fair,
regular
featured,
taciturn
looking
woman
rather
too
white
and
lifeless
for
my
taste.
But,
supposing
she
had
been
something
better
than
she
was
"
"Robert,"
interrupted
Yorke,
"I
could
fell
you
off
your
horse
at
this
moment.
However,
I'll
hold
my
hand.
Reason
tells
me
you
are
right
and
I
am
wrong.
I
know
well
enough
that
the
passion
I
still
have
is
only
the
remnant
of
an
illusion.
If
Miss
Cave
had
possessed
either
feeling
or
sense,
she
could
not
have
been
so
perfectly
impassible
to
my
regard
as
she
showed
herself;
she
must
have
preferred
me
to
that
copper
faced
despot."
"Supposing,
Yorke,
she
had
been
educated
(no
women
were
educated
in
those
days);
supposing
she
had
possessed
a
thoughtful,
original
mind,
a
love
of
knowledge,
a
wish
for
information,
which
she
took
an
artless
delight
in
receiving
from
your
lips,
and
having
measured
out
to
her
by
your
hand;
supposing
her
conversation,
when
she
sat
at
your
side,
was
fertile,
varied,
imbued
with
a
picturesque
grace
and
genial
interest,
quiet
flowing
but
clear
and
bounteous;
supposing
that
when
you
stood
near
her
by
chance,
or
when
you
sat
near
her
by
design,
comfort
at
once
became
your
atmosphere,
and
content
your
element;
supposing
that
whenever
her
face
was
under
your
gaze,
or
her
idea
filled
your
thoughts,
you
gradually
ceased
to
be
hard
and
anxious,
and
pure
affection,
love
of
home,
thirst
for
sweet
discourse,
unselfish
longing
to
protect
and
cherish,
replaced
the
sordid,
cankering
calculations
of
your
trade;
supposing,
with
all
this,
that
many
a
time,
when
you
had
been
so
happy
as
to
possess
your
Mary's
little
hand,
you
had
felt
it
tremble
as
you
held
it,
just
as
a
warm
little
bird
trembles
when
you
take
it
from
its
nest;
supposing
you
had
noticed
her
shrink
into
the
background
on
your
entrance
into
a
room,
yet
if
you
sought
her
in
her
retreat
she
welcomed
you
with
the
sweetest
smile
that
ever
lit
a
fair
virgin
face,
and
only
turned
her
eyes
from
the
encounter
of
your
own
lest
their
clearness
should
reveal
too
much;
supposing,
in
short,
your
Mary
had
been
not
cold,
but
modest;
not
vacant,
but
reflective;
not
obtuse,
but
sensitive;
not
inane,
but
innocent;
not
prudish,
but
pure,
would
you
have
left
her
to
court
another
woman
for
her
wealth?"
Mr.
Yorke
raised
his
hat,
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief.
"The
moon
is
up,"
was
his
first
not
quite
relevant
remark,
pointing
with
his
whip
across
the
moor.
"There
she
is,
rising
into
the
haze,
staring
at
us
wi'
a
strange
red
glower.
She
is
no
more
silver
than
old
Helstone's
brow
is
ivory.
What
does
she
mean
by
leaning
her
cheek
on
Rushedge
i'
that
way,
and
looking
at
us
wi'
a
scowl
and
a
menace?"
"Yorke,
if
Mary
had
loved
you
silently
yet
faithfully,
chastely
yet
fervently,
as
you
would
wish
your
wife
to
love,
would
you
have
left
her?"
"Robert!"
he
lifted
his
arm,
he
held
it
suspended,
and
paused
"Robert!
this
is
a
queer
world,
and
men
are
made
of
the
queerest
dregs
that
Chaos
churned
up
in
her
ferment.
I
might
swear
sounding
oaths
oaths
that
would
make
the
poachers
think
there
was
a
bittern
booming
in
Bilberry
Moss
that,
in
the
case
you
put,
death
only
should
have
parted
me
from
Mary.
But
I
have
lived
in
the
world
fifty
five
years;
I
have
been
forced
to
study
human
nature;
and,
to
speak
a
dark
truth,
the
odds
are,
if
Mary
had
loved
and
not
scorned
me,
if
I
had
been
secure
of
her
affection,
certain
of
her
constancy,
been
irritated
by
no
doubts,
stung
by
no
humiliations
the
odds
are"
(he
let
his
hand
fall
heavy
on
the
saddle)
"the
odds
are
I
should
have
left
her!"
They
rode
side
by
side
in
silence.
Ere
either
spoke
again
they
were
on
the
other
side
of
Rushedge.
Briarfield
lights
starred
the
purple
skirt
of
the
moor.
Robert,
being
the
youngest,
and
having
less
of
the
past
to
absorb
him
than
his
comrade,
recommenced
first.
"I
believe
I
daily
find
it
proved
that
we
can
get
nothing
in
this
world
worth
keeping,
not
so
much
as
a
principle
or
a
conviction,
except
out
of
purifying
flame
or
through
strengthening
peril.
We
err,
we
fall,
we
are
humbled;
then
we
walk
more
carefully.
We
greedily
eat
and
drink
poison
out
of
the
gilded
cup
of
vice
or
from
the
beggar's
wallet
of
avarice.
We
are
sickened,
degraded;
everything
good
in
us
rebels
against
us;
our
souls
rise
bitterly
indignant
against
our
bodies;
there
is
a
period
of
civil
war;
if
the
soul
has
strength,
it
conquers
and
rules
thereafter."
"What
art
thou
going
to
do
now,
Robert?
What
are
thy
plans?"
"For
my
private
plans,
I'll
keep
them
to
myself
which
is
very
easy,
as
at
present
I
have
none.
No
private
life
is
permitted
a
man
in
my
position
a
man
in
debt.
For
my
public
plans,
my
views
are
a
little
altered.
While
I
was
in
Birmingham
I
looked
a
little
into
reality,
considered
closely
and
at
their
source
the
causes
of
the
present
troubles
of
this
country.
I
did
the
same
in
London.
Unknown,
I
could
go
where
I
pleased,
mix
with
whom
I
would.
I
went
where
there
was
want
of
food,
of
fuel,
of
clothing;
where
there
was
no
occupation
and
no
hope.
I
saw
some,
with
naturally
elevated
tendencies
and
good
feelings,
kept
down
amongst
sordid
privations
and
harassing
griefs.
I
saw
many
originally
low,
and
to
whom
lack
of
education
left
scarcely
anything
but
animal
wants,
disappointed
in
those
wants,
ahungered,
athirst,
and
desperate
as
famished
animals.
I
saw
what
taught
my
brain
a
new
lesson,
and
filled
my
breast
with
fresh
feelings.
I
have
no
intention
to
profess
more
softness
or
sentiment
than
I
have
hitherto
professed;
mutiny
and
ambition
I
regard
as
I
have
always
regarded
them.
I
should
resist
a
riotous
mob
just
as
heretofore;
I
should
open
on
the
scent
of
a
runaway
ringleader
as
eagerly
as
ever,
and
run
him
down
as
relentlessly,
and
follow
him
up
to
condign
punishment
as
rigorously;
but
I
should
do
it
now
chiefly
for
the
sake
and
the
security
of
those
he
misled.
Something
there
is
to
look
to,
Yorke,
beyond
a
man's
personal
interest,
beyond
the
advancement
of
well
laid
schemes,
beyond
even
the
discharge
of
dishonouring
debts.
To
respect
himself,
a
man
must
believe
he
renders
justice
to
his
fellow
men.
Unless
I
am
more
considerate
to
ignorance,
more
forbearing
to
suffering,
than
I
have
hitherto
been,
I
shall
scorn
myself
as
grossly
unjust.
What
now?"
he
said,
addressing
his
horse,
which,
hearing
the
ripple
of
water,
and
feeling
thirsty,
turned
to
a
wayside
trough,
where
the
moonbeam
was
playing
in
a
crystal
eddy.
"Yorke,"
pursued
Moore,
"ride
on;
I
must
let
him
drink."
Yorke
accordingly
rode
slowly
forwards,
occupying
himself
as
he
advanced
in
discriminating,
amongst
the
many
lights
now
spangling
the
distance,
those
of
Briarmains.
Stilbro'
Moor
was
left
behind;
plantations
rose
dusk
on
either
hand;
they
were
descending
the
hill;
below
them
lay
the
valley
with
its
populous
parish:
they
felt
already
at
home.
Surrounded
no
longer
by
heath,
it
was
not
startling
to
Mr.
Yorke
to
see
a
hat
rise,
and
to
hear
a
voice
speak
behind
the
wall.
The
words,
however,
were
peculiar.
"When
the
wicked
perisheth
there
is
shouting,"
it
said;
and
added,
"As
the
whirlwind
passeth,
so
is
the
wicked
no
more"
(with
a
deeper
growl):
"terrors
take
hold
of
him
as
waters;
hell
is
naked
before
him.
He
shall
die
without
knowledge."
A
fierce
flash
and
sharp
crack
violated
the
calm
of
night.
Yorke,
ere
he
turned,
knew
the
four
convicts
of
Birmingham
were
avenged.
The
die
was
cast.
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
knew
it;
Shirley
knew
it;
Mr.
Sympson
knew
it.
That
evening,
when
all
the
Fieldhead
family
dined
at
Nunnely
Priory,
decided
the
business.
Two
or
three
things
conduced
to
bring
the
baronet
to
a
point.
He
had
observed
that
Miss
Keeldar
looked
pensive
and
delicate.
This
new
phase
in
her
demeanour
smote
him
on
his
weak
or
poetic
side.
A
spontaneous
sonnet
brewed
in
his
brain;
and
while
it
was
still
working
there,
one
of
his
sisters
persuaded
his
lady
love
to
sit
down
to
the
piano
and
sing
a
ballad
one
of
Sir
Philip's
own
ballads.
It
was
the
least
elaborate,
the
least
affected
out
of
all
comparison
the
best
of
his
numerous
efforts.
It
chanced
that
Shirley,
the
moment
before,
had
been
gazing
from
a
window
down
on
the
park.
She
had
seen
that
stormy
moonlight
which
"le
Professeur
Louis"
was
perhaps
at
the
same
instant
contemplating
from
her
own
oak
parlour
lattice;
she
had
seen
the
isolated
trees
of
the
domain
broad,
strong,
spreading
oaks,
and
high
towering
heroic
beeches
wrestling
with
the
gale.
Her
ear
had
caught
the
full
roar
of
the
forest
lower
down;
the
swift
rushing
of
clouds,
the
moon,
to
the
eye,
hasting
swifter
still,
had
crossed
her
vision.
She
turned
from
sight
and
sound
touched,
if
not
rapt;
wakened,
if
not
inspired.
She
sang,
as
requested.
There
was
much
about
love
in
the
ballad
faithful
love
that
refused
to
abandon
its
object;
love
that
disaster
could
not
shake;
love
that
in
calamity
waxed
fonder,
in
poverty
clung
closer.
The
words
were
set
to
a
fine
old
air;
in
themselves
they
were
simple
and
sweet.
Perhaps,
when
read,
they
wanted
force;
when
well
sung,
they
wanted
nothing.
Shirley
sang
them
well.
She
breathed
into
the
feeling
softness;
she
poured
round
the
passion
force.
Her
voice
was
fine
that
evening,
its
expression
dramatic.
She
impressed
all,
and
charmed
one.
On
leaving
the
instrument
she
went
to
the
fire,
and
sat
down
on
a
seat
semi
stool,
semi
cushion.
The
ladies
were
round
her;
none
of
them
spoke.
The
Misses
Sympson
and
the
Misses
Nunnely
looked
upon
her
as
quiet
poultry
might
look
on
an
egret,
an
ibis,
or
any
other
strange
fowl.
What
made
her
sing
so?
They
never
sang
so.
Was
it
proper
to
sing
with
such
expression,
with
such
originality
so
unlike
a
school
girl?
Decidedly
not.
It
was
strange,
it
was
unusual.
What
was
strange
must
be
wrong;
what
was
unusual
must
be
improper.
Shirley
was
judged.
Moreover,
old
Lady
Nunnely
eyed
her
stonily
from
her
great
chair
by
the
fireside.
Her
gaze
said,
"This
woman
is
not
of
mine
or
my
daughters'
kind.
I
object
to
her
as
my
son's
wife."
Her
son,
catching
the
look,
read
its
meaning.
He
grew
alarmed.
What
he
so
wished
to
win
there
was
danger
he
might
lose.
He
must
make
haste.
The
room
they
were
in
had
once
been
a
picture
gallery.
Sir
Philip's
father
Sir
Monckton
had
converted
it
into
a
saloon;
but
still
it
had
a
shadowy,
long
withdrawing
look.
A
deep
recess
with
a
window
a
recess
that
held
one
couch,
one
table,
and
a
fairy
cabinet
formed
a
room
within
a
room.
Two
persons
standing
there
might
interchange
a
dialogue,
and,
so
it
were
neither
long
nor
loud,
none
be
the
wiser.
Sir
Philip
induced
two
of
his
sisters
to
perpetrate
a
duet.
He
gave
occupation
to
the
Misses
Sympson.
The
elder
ladies
were
conversing
together.
He
was
pleased
to
remark
that
meantime
Shirley
rose
to
look
at
the
pictures.
He
had
a
tale
to
tell
about
one
ancestress,
whose
dark
beauty
seemed
as
that
of
a
flower
of
the
south.
He
joined
her,
and
began
to
tell
it.
There
were
mementoes
of
the
same
lady
in
the
cabinet
adorning
the
recess;
and
while
Shirley
was
stooping
to
examine
the
missal
and
the
rosary
on
the
inlaid
shelf,
and
while
the
Misses
Nunnely
indulged
in
a
prolonged
screech,
guiltless
of
expression,
pure
of
originality,
perfectly
conventional
and
absolutely
unmeaning,
Sir
Philip
stooped
too,
and
whispered
a
few
hurried
sentences.
At
first
Miss
Keeldar
was
struck
so
still
you
might
have
fancied
that
whisper
a
charm
which
had
changed
her
to
a
statue;
but
she
presently
looked
up
and
answered.
They
parted.
Miss
Keeldar
returned
to
the
fire,
and
resumed
her
seat.
The
baronet
gazed
after
her,
then
went
and
stood
behind
his
sisters.
Mr.
Sympson
Mr.
Sympson
only
had
marked
the
pantomime.
That
gentleman
drew
his
own
conclusions.
Had
he
been
as
acute
as
he
was
meddling,
as
profound
as
he
was
prying,
he
might
have
found
that
in
Sir
Philip's
face
whereby
to
correct
his
inference.
Ever
shallow,
hasty,
and
positive,
he
went
home
quite
cock
a
hoop.
He
was
not
a
man
that
kept
secrets
well.
When
elate
on
a
subject,
he
could
not
avoid
talking
about
it.
The
next
morning,
having
occasion
to
employ
his
son's
tutor
as
his
secretary,
he
must
needs
announce
to
him,
in
mouthing
accents,
and
with
much
flimsy
pomp
of
manner,
that
he
had
better
hold
himself
prepared
for
a
return
to
the
south
at
an
early
day,
as
the
important
business
which
had
detained
him
(Mr.
Sympson)
so
long
in
Yorkshire
was
now
on
the
eve
of
fortunate
completion.
His
anxious
and
laborious
efforts
were
likely,
at
last,
to
be
crowned
with
the
happiest
success.
A
truly
eligible
addition
was
about
to
be
made
to
the
family
connections.
"In
Sir
Philip
Nunnely?"
Louis
Moore
conjectured.
Whereupon
Mr.
Sympson
treated
himself
simultaneously
to
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
a
chuckling
laugh,
checked
only
by
a
sudden
choke
of
dignity,
and
an
order
to
the
tutor
to
proceed
with
business.
For
a
day
or
two
Mr.
Sympson
continued
as
bland
as
oil,
but
also
he
seemed
to
sit
on
pins,
and
his
gait,
when
he
walked,
emulated
that
of
a
hen
treading
a
hot
girdle.
He
was
for
ever
looking
out
of
the
window
and
listening
for
chariot
wheels.
Bluebeard's
wife
Sisera's
mother
were
nothing
to
him.
He
waited
when
the
matter
should
be
opened
in
form,
when
himself
should
be
consulted,
when
lawyers
should
be
summoned,
when
settlement
discussions
and
all
the
delicious
worldly
fuss
should
pompously
begin.
At
last
there
came
a
letter.
He
himself
handed
it
to
Miss
Keeldar
out
of
the
bag.
He
knew
the
handwriting;
he
knew
the
crest
on
the
seal.
He
did
not
see
it
opened
and
read,
for
Shirley
took
it
to
her
own
room;
nor
did
he
see
it
answered,
for
she
wrote
her
reply
shut
up,
and
was
very
long
about
it
the
best
part
of
a
day.
He
questioned
her
whether
it
was
answered;
she
responded,
"Yes."
Again
he
waited
waited
in
silence,
absolutely
not
daring
to
speak,
kept
mute
by
something
in
Shirley's
face
a
very
awful
something
inscrutable
to
him
as
the
writing
on
the
wall
to
Belshazzar.
He
was
moved
more
than
once
to
call
Daniel,
in
the
person
of
Louis
Moore,
and
to
ask
an
interpretation;
but
his
dignity
forbade
the
familiarity.
Daniel
himself,
perhaps,
had
his
own
private
difficulties
connected
with
that
baffling
bit
of
translation;
he
looked
like
a
student
for
whom
grammars
are
blank
and
dictionaries
dumb.
Mr.
Sympson
had
been
out,
to
while
away
an
anxious
hour
in
the
society
of
his
friends
at
De
Walden
Hall.
He
returned
a
little
sooner
than
was
expected.
His
family
and
Miss
Keeldar
were
assembled
in
the
oak
parlour.
Addressing
the
latter,
he
requested
her
to
step
with
him
into
another
room.
He
wished
to
have
with
her
a
"strictly
private
interview."
She
rose,
asking
no
questions
and
professing
no
surprise.
"Very
well,
sir,"
she
said,
in
the
tone
of
a
determined
person
who
is
informed
that
the
dentist
is
come
to
extract
that
large
double
tooth
of
his,
from
which
he
has
suffered
such
a
purgatory
this
month
past.
She
left
her
sewing
and
her
thimble
in
the
window
seat,
and
followed
her
uncle
where
he
led.
Shut
into
the
drawing
room,
the
pair
took
seats,
each
in
an
arm
chair,
placed
opposite,
a
few
yards
between
them.
"I
have
been
to
De
Walden
Hall,"
said
Mr.
Sympson.
He
paused.
Miss
Keeldar's
eyes
were
on
the
pretty
white
and
green
carpet.
That
information
required
no
response.
She
gave
none.
"I
have
learned,"
he
went
on
slowly
"I
have
learned
a
circumstance
which
surprises
me."
Resting
her
cheek
on
her
forefinger,
she
waited
to
be
told
what
circumstance.
"It
seems
that
Nunnely
Priory
is
shut
up
that
the
family
are
gone
back
to
their
place
in
shire.
It
seems
that
the
baronet
that
the
baronet
that
Sir
Philip
himself
has
accompanied
his
mother
and
sisters."
"Indeed!"
said
Shirley.
"May
I
ask
if
you
share
the
amazement
with
which
I
received
this
news?"
"No,
sir."
"Is
it
news
to
you?"
"Yes,
sir."
"I
mean
I
mean,"
pursued
Mr.
Sympson,
now
fidgeting
in
his
chair,
quitting
his
hitherto
brief
and
tolerably
clear
phraseology,
and
returning
to
his
customary
wordy,
confused,
irritable
style
"I
mean
to
have
a
thorough
explanation.
I
will
not
be
put
off.
I
I
shall
insist
on
being
heard,
and
on
on
having
my
own
way.
My
questions
must
be
answered.
I
will
have
clear,
satisfactory
replies.
I
am
not
to
be
trifled
with.
(Silence.)
"It
is
a
strange
and
an
extraordinary
thing
a
very
singular
a
most
odd
thing!
I
thought
all
was
right,
knew
no
other;
and
there
the
family
are
gone!"
"I
suppose,
sir,
they
had
a
right
to
go."
"Sir
Philip
is
gone!"
(with
emphasis).
Shirley
raised
her
brows.
"Bon
voyage!"
said
she.
"This
will
not
do;
this
must
be
altered,
ma'am."
He
drew
his
chair
forward;
he
pushed
it
back;
he
looked
perfectly
incensed,
and
perfectly
helpless.
"Come,
come
now,
uncle,"
expostulated
Shirley,
"do
not
begin
to
fret
and
fume,
or
we
shall
make
no
sense
of
the
business.
Ask
me
what
you
want
to
know.
I
am
as
willing
to
come
to
an
explanation
as
you.
I
promise
you
truthful
replies."
"I
want
I
demand
to
know,
Miss
Keeldar,
whether
Sir
Philip
has
made
you
an
offer?"
"He
has."
"You
avow
it?"
"I
avow
it.
But
now,
go
on.
Consider
that
point
settled."
"He
made
you
an
offer
that
night
we
dined
at
the
priory?"
"It
is
enough
to
say
that
he
made
it.
Go
on."
"He
proposed
in
the
recess
in
the
room
that
used
to
be
a
picture
gallery
that
Sir
Monckton
converted
into
it
saloon?"
No
answer.
"You
were
both
examining
a
cabinet.
I
saw
it
all.
My
sagacity
was
not
at
fault
it
never
is.
Subsequently
you
received
a
letter
from
him.
On
what
subject
of
what
nature
were
the
contents?"
"No
matter."
"Ma'am,
is
that
the
way
in
which
you
speak
to
me?"
Shirley's
foot
tapped
quick
on
the
carpet.
"There
you
sit,
silent
and
sullen
you
who
promised
truthful
replies."
"Sir,
I
have
answered
you
thus
far.
Proceed."
"I
should
like
to
see
that
letter."
"You
cannot
see
it."
"I
must
and
shall,
ma'am;
I
am
your
guardian."
"Having
ceased
to
be
a
ward,
I
have
no
guardian."
"Ungrateful
being!
Reared
by
me
as
my
own
daughter
"
"Once
more,
uncle,
have
the
kindness
to
keep
to
the
point.
Let
us
both
remain
cool.
For
my
part,
I
do
not
wish
to
get
into
a
passion;
but,
you
know,
once
drive
me
beyond
certain
bounds,
I
care
little
what
I
say
I
am
not
then
soon
checked.
Listen!
You
have
asked
me
whether
Sir
Philip
made
me
an
offer.
That
question
is
answered.
What
do
you
wish
to
know
next?"
"I
desire
to
know
whether
you
accepted
or
refused
him,
and
know
it
I
will."
"Certainly,
you
ought
to
know
it.
I
refused
him."
"Refused
him!
You
you,
Shirley
Keeldar,
refused
Sir
Philip
Nunnely?"
"I
did."
The
poor
gentleman
bounced
from
his
chair,
and
first
rushed
and
then
trotted
through
the
room.
"There
it
is!
There
it
is!
There
it
is!"
"Sincerely
speaking,
I
am
sorry,
uncle,
you
are
so
disappointed."
Concession,
contrition,
never
do
any
good
with
some
people.
Instead
of
softening
and
conciliating,
they
but
embolden
and
harden
them.
Of
that
number
was
Mr.
Sympson.
"I
disappointed?
What
is
it
to
me?
Have
I
an
interest
in
it?
You
would
insinuate,
perhaps,
that
I
have
motives?"
"Most
people
have
motives
of
some
sort
for
their
actions."
"She
accuses
me
to
my
face!
I,
that
have
been
a
parent
to
her,
she
charges
with
bad
motives!"
"Bad
motives
I
did
not
say."
"And
now
you
prevaricate;
you
have
no
principles!"
"Uncle,
you
tire
me.
I
want
to
go
away."
"Go
you
shall
not!
I
will
be
answered.
What
are
your
intentions,
Miss
Keeldar?"
"In
what
respect?"
"In
respect
of
matrimony?"
"To
be
quiet,
and
to
do
just
as
I
please."
"Just
as
you
please!
The
words
are
to
the
last
degree
indecorous."
"Mr.
Sympson,
I
advise
you
not
to
become
insulting.
You
know
I
will
not
bear
that."
"You
read
French.
Your
mind
is
poisoned
with
French
novels.
You
have
imbibed
French
principles."
"The
ground
you
are
treading
now
returns
a
mighty
hollow
sound
under
your
feet.
Beware!"
"It
will
end
in
infamy,
sooner
or
later.
I
have
foreseen
it
all
along."
"Do
you
assert,
sir,
that
something
in
which
I
am
concerned
will
end
in
infamy?"
"That
it
will
that
it
will.
You
said
just
now
you
would
act
as
you
please.
You
acknowledge
no
rules
no
limitations."
"Silly
stuff,
and
vulgar
as
silly!"
"Regardless
of
decorum,
you
are
prepared
to
fly
in
the
face
of
propriety."
"You
tire
me,
uncle."
"What,
madam
what
could
be
your
reasons
for
refusing
Sir
Philip?"
"At
last
there
is
another
sensible
question;
I
shall
be
glad
to
reply
to
it.
Sir
Philip
is
too
young
for
me.
I
regard
him
as
a
boy.
All
his
relations
his
mother
especially
would
be
annoyed
if
he
married
me.
Such
a
step
would
embroil
him
with
them.
I
am
not
his
equal
in
the
world's
estimation."
"Is
that
all?"
"Our
dispositions
are
not
compatible."
"Why,
a
more
amiable
gentleman
never
breathed."
"He
is
very
amiable
very
excellent
truly
estimable;
but
not
my
master
not
in
one
point.
I
could
not
trust
myself
with
his
happiness.
I
would
not
undertake
the
keeping
of
it
for
thousands.
I
will
accept
no
hand
which
cannot
hold
me
in
check."
"I
thought
you
liked
to
do
as
you
please.
You
are
vastly
inconsistent."
"When
I
promise
to
obey,
it
shall
be
under
the
conviction
that
I
can
keep
that
promise.
I
could
not
obey
a
youth
like
Sir
Philip.
Besides,
he
would
never
command
me.
He
would
expect
me
always
to
rule
to
guide
and
I
have
no
taste
whatever
for
the
office."
"You
no
taste
for
swaggering,
and
subduing,
and
ordering,
and
ruling?"
"Not
my
husband;
only
my
uncle."
"Where
is
the
difference?"
"There
is
a
slight
difference
that
is
certain.
And
I
know
full
well
any
man
who
wishes
to
live
in
decent
comfort
with
me
as
a
husband
must
be
able
to
control
me."
"I
wish
you
had
a
real
tyrant."
"A
tyrant
would
not
hold
me
for
a
day,
not
for
an
hour.
I
would
rebel
break
from
him
defy
him."
"Are
you
not
enough
to
bewilder
one's
brain
with
your
self
contradiction?"
"It
is
evident
I
bewilder
your
brain."
"You
talk
of
Sir
Philip
being
young.
He
is
two
and
twenty."
"My
husband
must
be
thirty,
with
the
sense
of
forty."
"You
had
better
pick
out
some
old
man
some
white
headed
or
bald
headed
swain."
"No,
thank
you."
"You
could
lead
some
doting
fool;
you
might
pin
him
to
your
apron."
"I
might
do
that
with
a
boy;
but
it
is
not
my
vocation.
Did
I
not
say
I
prefer
a
master
one
in
whose
presence
I
shall
feel
obliged
and
disposed
to
be
good;
one
whose
control
my
impatient
temper
must
acknowledge;
a
man
whose
approbation
can
reward,
whose
displeasure
punish
me;
a
man
I
shall
feel
it
impossible
not
to
love,
and
very
possible
to
fear?"
"What
is
there
to
hinder
you
from
doing
all
this
with
Sir
Philip?
He
is
a
baronet
a
man
of
rank,
property,
connections
far
above
yours.
If
you
talk
of
intellect,
he
is
a
poet
he
writes
verses;
which
you,
I
take
it,
cannot
do,
with
all
your
cleverness."
"Neither
his
title,
wealth,
pedigree,
nor
poetry
avail
to
invest
him
with
the
power
I
describe.
These
are
feather
weights;
they
want
ballast.
A
measure
of
sound,
solid,
practical
sense
would
have
stood
him
in
better
stead
with
me."
"You
and
Henry
rave
about
poetry!
You
used
to
catch
fire
like
tinder
on
the
subject
when
you
were
a
girl."
"O
uncle,
there
is
nothing
really
valuable
in
this
world,
there
is
nothing
glorious
in
the
world
to
come
that
is
not
poetry!"
"Marry
a
poet,
then,
in
God's
name!"
"Show
him
me,
and
I
will."
"Sir
Philip."
"Not
at
all.
You
are
almost
as
good
a
poet
as
he."
"Madam,
you
are
wandering
from
the
point."
"Indeed,
uncle,
I
wanted
to
do
so,
and
I
shall
be
glad
to
lead
you
away
with
me.
Do
not
let
us
get
out
of
temper
with
each
other;
it
is
not
worth
while."
"Out
of
temper,
Miss
Keeldar!
I
should
be
glad
to
know
who
is
out
of
temper."
"I
am
not,
yet."
"If
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
I
am,
I
consider
that
you
are
guilty
of
impertinence."
"You
will
be
soon,
if
you
go
on
at
that
rate."
"There
it
is!
With
your
pert
tongue
you
would
try
the
patience
of
a
Job."
"I
know
I
should."
"No
levity,
miss!
This
is
not
a
laughing
matter.
It
is
an
affair
I
am
resolved
to
probe
thoroughly,
convinced
that
there
is
mischief
at
the
bottom.
You
described
just
now,
with
far
too
much
freedom
for
your
years
and
sex,
the
sort
of
individual
you
would
prefer
as
a
husband.
Pray,
did
you
paint
from
the
life?"
Shirley
opened
her
lips,
but
instead
of
speaking
she
only
glowed
rose
red.
"I
shall
have
an
answer
to
that
question,"
affirmed
Mr.
Sympson,
assuming
vast
courage
and
consequence
on
the
strength
of
this
symptom
of
confusion.
"It
was
an
historical
picture,
uncle,
from
several
originals."
"Several
originals!
Bless
my
heart!"
"I
have
been
in
love
several
times."
"This
is
cynical."
"With
heroes
of
many
nations."
"What
next
"
"And
philosophers."
"She
is
mad
"
"Don't
ring
the
bell,
uncle;
you
will
alarm
my
aunt."
"Your
poor
dear
aunt,
what
a
niece
has
she!"
"Once
I
loved
Socrates."
"Pooh!
no
trifling,
ma'am."
"I
admired
Themistocles,
Leonidas,
Epaminondas."
"Miss
Keeldar
"
"To
pass
over
a
few
centuries,
Washington
was
a
plain
man,
but
I
liked
him;
but
to
speak
of
the
actual
present
"
"Ah!
the
actual
present."
"To
quit
crude
schoolgirl
fancies,
and
come
to
realities."
"Realities!
That
is
the
test
to
which
you
shall
be
brought,
ma'am."
"To
avow
before
what
altar
I
now
kneel
to
reveal
the
present
idol
of
my
soul
"
"You
will
make
haste
about
it,
if
you
please.
It
is
near
luncheon
time,
and
confess
you
shall."
"Confess
I
must.
My
heart
is
full
of
the
secret.
It
must
be
spoken.
I
only
wish
you
were
Mr.
Helstone
instead
of
Mr.
Sympson;
you
would
sympathize
with
me
better."
"Madam,
it
is
a
question
of
common
sense
and
common
prudence,
not
of
sympathy
and
sentiment,
and
so
on.
Did
you
say
it
was
Mr.
Helstone?"
"Not
precisely,
but
as
near
as
may
be;
they
are
rather
alike."
"I
will
know
the
name;
I
will
have
particulars."
"They
positively
are
rather
alike.
Their
very
faces
are
not
dissimilar
a
pair
of
human
falcons
and
dry,
direct,
decided
both.
But
my
hero
is
the
mightier
of
the
two.
His
mind
has
the
clearness
of
the
deep
sea,
the
patience
of
its
rocks,
the
force
of
its
billows."
"Rant
and
fustian!"
"I
dare
say
he
can
be
harsh
as
a
saw
edge
and
gruff
as
a
hungry
raven."
"Miss
Keeldar,
does
the
person
reside
in
Briarfield?
Answer
me
that."
"Uncle,
I
am
going
to
tell
you;
his
name
is
trembling
on
my
tongue."
"Speak,
girl!"
"That
was
well
said,
uncle.
'Speak,
girl!'
It
is
quite
tragic.
England
has
howled
savagely
against
this
man,
uncle,
and
she
will
one
day
roar
exultingly
over
him.
He
has
been
unscared
by
the
howl,
and
he
will
be
unelated
by
the
shout."
"I
said
she
was
mad.
She
is."
"This
country
will
change
and
change
again
in
her
demeanour
to
him;
he
will
never
change
in
his
duty
to
her.
Come,
cease
to
chafe,
uncle,
I'll
tell
you
his
name."
"You
shall
tell
me,
or
"
"Listen!
Arthur
Wellesley,
Lord
Wellington."
Mr.
Sympson
rose
up
furious.
He
bounced
out
of
the
room,
but
immediately
bounced
back
again,
shut
the
door,
and
resumed
his
seat.
"Ma'am,
you
shall
tell
me
this.
Will
your
principles
permit
you
to
marry
a
man
without
money
a
man
below
you?"
"Never
a
man
below
me."
(In
a
high
voice.)
"Will
you,
Miss
Keeldar,
marry
a
poor
man?"
"What
right
have
you,
Mr.
Sympson,
to
ask
me?"
"I
insist
upon
knowing."
"You
don't
go
the
way
to
know."
"My
family
respectability
shall
not
be
compromised."
"A
good
resolution;
keep
it."
"Madam,
it
is
you
who
shall
keep
it."
"Impossible,
sir,
since
I
form
no
part
of
your
family."
"Do
you
disown
us?"
"I
disdain
your
dictatorship."
"Whom
will
you
marry,
Miss
Keeldar?"
"Not
Mr.
Sam
Wynne,
because
I
scorn
him;
not
Sir
Philip
Nunnely,
because
I
only
esteem
him."
"Whom
have
you
in
your
eye?"
"Four
rejected
candidates."
"Such
obstinacy
could
not
be
unless
you
were
under
improper
influence."
"What
do
you
mean?
There
are
certain
phrases
potent
to
make
my
blood
boil.
Improper
influence!
What
old
woman's
cackle
is
that?"
"Are
you
a
young
lady?"
"I
am
a
thousand
times
better:
I
am
an
honest
woman,
and
as
such
I
will
be
treated."
"Do
you
know"
(leaning
mysteriously
forward,
and
speaking
with
ghastly
solemnity)
"do
you
know
the
whole
neighbourhood
teems
with
rumours
respecting
you
and
a
bankrupt
tenant
of
yours,
the
foreigner
Moore?"
"Does
it?"
"It
does.
Your
name
is
in
every
mouth."
"It
honours
the
lips
it
crosses,
and
I
wish
to
the
gods
it
may
purify
them."
"Is
it
that
person
who
has
power
to
influence
you?"
"Beyond
any
whose
cause
you
have
advocated."
"Is
it
he
you
will
marry?"
"He
is
handsome,
and
manly,
and
commanding."
"You
declare
it
to
my
face!
The
Flemish
knave!
the
low
trader!"
"He
is
talented,
and
venturous,
and
resolute.
Prince
is
on
his
brow,
and
ruler
in
his
bearing."
"She
glories
in
it!
She
conceals
nothing!
No
shame,
no
fear!"
"When
we
speak
the
name
of
Moore,
shame
should
be
forgotten
and
fear
discarded.
The
Moores
know
only
honour
and
courage."
"I
say
she
is
mad."
"You
have
taunted
me
till
my
blood
is
up;
you
have
worried
me
till
I
turn
again."
"That
Moore
is
the
brother
of
my
son's
tutor.
Would
you
let
the
usher
call
you
sister?"
Bright
and
broad
shone
Shirley's
eye
as
she
fixed
it
on
her
questioner
now.
"No,
no;
not
for
a
province
of
possession,
not
for
a
century
of
life."
"You
cannot
separate
the
husband
from
his
family."
"What
then?"
"Mr.
Louis
Moore's
sister
you
will
be."
"Mr.
Sympson,
I
am
sick
at
heart
with
all
this
weak
trash;
I
will
bear
no
more.
Your
thoughts
are
not
my
thoughts,
your
aims
are
not
my
aims,
your
gods
are
not
my
gods.
We
do
not
view
things
in
the
same
light;
we
do
not
measure
them
by
the
same
standard;
we
hardly
speak
in
the
same
tongue.
Let
us
part."
"It
is
not,"
she
resumed,
much
excited
"it
is
not
that
I
hate
you;
you
are
a
good
sort
of
man.
Perhaps
you
mean
well
in
your
way.
But
we
cannot
suit;
we
are
ever
at
variance.
You
annoy
me
with
small
meddling,
with
petty
tyranny;
you
exasperate
my
temper,
and
make
and
keep
me
passionate.
As
to
your
small
maxims,
your
narrow
rules,
your
little
prejudices,
aversions,
dogmas,
bundle
them
off.
Mr.
Sympson,
go,
offer
them
a
sacrifice
to
the
deity
you
worship;
I'll
none
of
them.
I
wash
my
hands
of
the
lot.
I
walk
by
another
creed,
light,
faith,
and
hope
than
you."
"Another
creed!
I
believe
she
is
an
infidel."
"An
infidel
to
your
religion,
an
atheist
to
your
god."
"An
atheist!!!"
"Your
god,
sir,
is
the
world.
In
my
eyes
you
too,
if
not
an
infidel,
are
an
idolater.
I
conceive
that
you
ignorantly
worship;
in
all
things
you
appear
to
me
too
superstitious.
Sir,
your
god,
your
great
Bel,
your
fish
tailed
Dagon,
rises
before
me
as
a
demon.
You,
and
such
as
you,
have
raised
him
to
a
throne,
put
on
him
a
crown,
given
him
a
sceptre.
Behold
how
hideously
he
governs!
See
him
busied
at
the
work
he
likes
best
making
marriages.
He
binds
the
young
to
the
old,
the
strong
to
the
imbecile.
He
stretches
out
the
arm
of
Mezentius,
and
fetters
the
dead
to
the
living.
In
his
realm
there
is
hatred
secret
hatred;
there
is
disgust
unspoken
disgust;
there
is
treachery
family
treachery;
there
is
vice
deep,
deadly
domestic
vice.
In
his
dominions
children
grow
unloving
between
parents
who
have
never
loved;
infants
are
nursed
on
deception
from
their
very
birth;
they
are
reared
in
an
atmosphere
corrupt
with
lies.
Your
god
rules
at
the
bridal
of
kings;
look
at
your
royal
dynasties!
Your
deity
is
the
deity
of
foreign
aristocracies;
analyze
the
blue
blood
of
Spain!
Your
god
is
the
Hymen
of
France;
what
is
French
domestic
life?
All
that
surrounds
him
hastens
to
decay;
all
declines
and
degenerates
under
his
sceptre.
Your
god
is
a
masked
Death."
"This
language
is
terrible!
My
daughters
and
you
must
associate
no
longer,
Miss
Keeldar;
there
is
danger
in
such
companionship.
Had
I
known
you
a
little
earlier
but,
extraordinary
as
I
thought
you,
I
could
not
have
believed
"
"Now,
sir,
do
you
begin
to
be
aware
that
it
is
useless
to
scheme
for
me;
that
in
doing
so
you
but
sow
the
wind
to
reap
the
whirlwind?
I
sweep
your
cobweb
projects
from
my
path,
that
I
may
pass
on
unsullied.
I
am
anchored
on
a
resolve
you
cannot
shake.
My
heart,
my
conscience
shall
dispose
of
my
hand
they
only.
Know
this
at
last."
Mr.
Sympson
was
becoming
a
little
bewildered.
"Never
heard
such
language!"
he
muttered
again
and
again;
"never
was
so
addressed
in
my
life
never
was
so
used!"
"You
are
quite
confused,
sir.
You
had
better
withdraw,
or
I
will."
He
rose
hastily.
"We
must
leave
this
place;
they
must
pack
up
at
once."
"Do
not
hurry
my
aunt
and
cousins;
give
them
time."
"No
more
intercourse;
she's
not
proper."
He
made
his
way
to
the
door.
He
came
back
for
his
handkerchief.
He
dropped
his
snuff
box,
leaving
the
contents
scattered
on
the
carpet;
he
stumbled
out.
Tartar
lay
outside
across
the
mat;
Mr.
Sympson
almost
fell
over
him.
In
the
climax
of
his
exasperation
he
hurled
an
oath
at
the
dog
and
a
coarse
epithet
at
his
mistress.
"Poor
Mr.
Sympson!
he
is
both
feeble
and
vulgar,"
said
Shirley
to
herself.
"My
head
aches,
and
I
am
tired,"
she
added;
and
leaning
her
head
upon
a
cushion,
she
softly
subsided
from
excitement
to
repose.
One,
entering
the
room
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards,
found
her
asleep.
When
Shirley
had
been
agitated,
she
generally
took
this
natural
refreshment;
it
would
come
at
her
call.
The
intruder
paused
in
her
unconscious
presence,
and
said,
"Miss
Keeldar."
Perhaps
his
voice
harmonized
with
some
dream
into
which
she
was
passing.
It
did
not
startle,
it
hardly
roused
her.
Without
opening
her
eyes,
she
but
turned
her
head
a
little,
so
that
her
cheek
and
profile,
before
hidden
by
her
arm,
became
visible.
She
looked
rosy,
happy,
half
smiling,
but
her
eyelashes
were
wet.
She
had
wept
in
slumber;
or
perhaps,
before
dropping
asleep,
a
few
natural
tears
had
fallen
after
she
had
heard
that
epithet.
No
man
no
woman
is
always
strong,
always
able
to
bear
up
against
the
unjust
opinion,
the
vilifying
word.
Calumny,
even
from
the
mouth
of
a
fool,
will
sometimes
cut
into
unguarded
feelings.
Shirley
looked
like
a
child
that
had
been
naughty
and
punished,
but
was
now
forgiven
and
at
rest.
"Miss
Keeldar,"
again
said
the
voice.
This
time
it
woke
her.
She
looked
up,
and
saw
at
her
side
Louis
Moore
not
close
at
her
side,
but
standing,
with
arrested
step,
two
or
three
yards
from
her.
"O
Mr.
Moore!"
she
said.
"I
was
afraid
it
was
my
uncle
again:
he
and
I
have
quarrelled."
"Mr.
Sympson
should
let
you
alone,"
was
the
reply.
"Can
he
not
see
that
you
are
as
yet
far
from
strong?"
"I
assure
you
he
did
not
find
me
weak.
I
did
not
cry
when
he
was
here."
"He
is
about
to
evacuate
Fieldhead
so
he
says.
He
is
now
giving
orders
to
his
family.
He
has
been
in
the
schoolroom
issuing
commands
in
a
manner
which,
I
suppose,
was
a
continuation
of
that
with
which
he
has
harassed
you."
"Are
you
and
Henry
to
go?"
"I
believe,
as
far
as
Henry
is
concerned,
that
was
the
tenor
of
his
scarcely
intelligible
directions;
but
he
may
change
all
to
morrow.
He
is
just
in
that
mood
when
you
cannot
depend
on
his
consistency
for
two
consecutive
hours.
I
doubt
whether
he
will
leave
you
for
weeks
yet.
To
myself
he
addressed
some
words
which
will
require
a
little
attention
and
comment
by
and
by,
when
I
have
time
to
bestow
on
them.
At
the
moment
he
came
in
I
was
busied
with
a
note
I
had
got
from
Mr.
Yorke
so
fully
busied
that
I
cut
short
the
interview
with
him
somewhat
abruptly.
I
left
him
raving.
Here
is
the
note.
I
wish
you
to
see
it.
It
refers
to
my
brother
Robert."
And
he
looked
at
Shirley.
"I
shall
be
glad
to
hear
news
of
him.
Is
he
coming
home?"
"He
is
come.
He
is
in
Yorkshire.
Mr.
Yorke
went
yesterday
to
Stilbro'
to
meet
him."
"Mr.
Moore,
something
is
wrong
"
"Did
my
voice
tremble?
He
is
now
at
Briarmains,
and
I
am
going
to
see
him."
"What
has
occurred?"
"If
you
turn
so
pale
I
shall
be
sorry
I
have
spoken.
It
might
have
been
worse.
Robert
is
not
dead,
but
much
hurt."
"O
sir,
it
is
you
who
are
pale.
Sit
down
near
me."
"Read
the
note.
Let
me
open
it."
Miss
Keeldar
read
the
note.
It
briefly
signified
that
last
night
Robert
Moore
had
been
shot
at
from
behind
the
wall
of
Milldean
plantation,
at
the
foot
of
the
Brow;
that
he
was
wounded
severely,
but
it
was
hoped
not
fatally.
Of
the
assassin,
or
assassins,
nothing
was
known;
they
had
escaped.
"No
doubt,"
Mr.
Yorke
observed,
"it
was
done
in
revenge.
It
was
a
pity
ill
will
had
ever
been
raised;
but
that
could
not
be
helped
now."
"He
is
my
only
brother,"
said
Louis,
as
Shirley
returned
the
note.
"I
cannot
hear
unmoved
that
ruffians
have
laid
in
wait
for
him,
and
shot
him
down,
like
some
wild
beast
from
behind
a
wall."
"Be
comforted;
be
hopeful.
He
will
get
better
I
know
he
will."
Shirley,
solicitous
to
soothe,
held
her
hand
over
Mr.
Moore's
as
it
lay
on
the
arm
of
the
chair.
She
just
touched
it
lightly,
scarce
palpably.
"Well,
give
me
your
hand,"
he
said.
"It
will
be
for
the
first
time;
it
is
in
a
moment
of
calamity.
Give
it
me."
Awaiting
neither
consent
nor
refusal,
he
took
what
he
asked.
"I
am
going
to
Briarmains
now,"
he
went
on.
"I
want
you
to
step
over
to
the
rectory
and
tell
Caroline
Helstone
what
has
happened.
Will
you
do
this?
She
will
hear
it
best
from
you."
"Immediately,"
said
Shirley,
with
docile
promptitude.
"Ought
I
to
say
that
there
is
no
danger?"
"Say
so."
"You
will
come
back
soon,
and
let
me
know
more?"
"I
will
either
come
or
write."
"Trust
me
for
watching
over
Caroline.
I
will
communicate
with
your
sister
too;
but
doubtless
she
is
already
with
Robert?"
"Doubtless,
or
will
be
soon.
Good
morning
now."
"You
will
bear
up,
come
what
may."
"We
shall
see
that."
Shirley's
fingers
were
obliged
to
withdraw
from
the
tutor's.
Louis
was
obliged
to
relinquish
that
hand
folded,
clasped,
hidden
in
his
own.
"I
thought
I
should
have
had
to
support
her,"
he
said,
as
he
walked
towards
Briarmains,
"and
it
is
she
who
has
made
me
strong.
That
look
of
pity,
that
gentle
touch!
No
down
was
ever
softer,
no
elixir
more
potent!
It
lay
like
a
snowflake;
it
thrilled
like
lightning.
A
thousand
times
I
have
longed
to
possess
that
hand
to
have
it
in
mine.
I
have
possessed
it;
for
five
minutes
I
held
it.
Her
fingers
and
mine
can
never
be
strangers
more.
Having
met
once
they
must
meet
again."
Briarmains
being
nearer
than
the
Hollow,
Mr.
Yorke
had
conveyed
his
young
comrade
there.
He
had
seen
him
laid
in
the
best
bed
of
the
house,
as
carefully
as
if
he
had
been
one
of
his
own
sons.
The
sight
of
his
blood,
welling
from
the
treacherously
inflicted
wound,
made
him
indeed
the
son
of
the
Yorkshire
gentleman's
heart.
The
spectacle
of
the
sudden
event,
of
the
tall,
straight
shape
prostrated
in
its
pride
across
the
road,
of
the
fine
southern
head
laid
low
in
the
dust,
of
that
youth
in
prime
flung
at
once
before
him
pallid,
lifeless,
helpless
this
was
the
very
combination
of
circumstances
to
win
for
the
victim
Mr.
Yorke's
liveliest
interest.
No
other
hand
was
there
to
raise
to
aid,
no
other
voice
to
question
kindly,
no
other
brain
to
concert
measures;
he
had
to
do
it
all
himself.
This
utter
dependence
of
the
speechless,
bleeding
youth
(as
a
youth
he
regarded
him)
on
his
benevolence
secured
that
benevolence
most
effectually.
Well
did
Mr.
Yorke
like
to
have
power,
and
to
use
it.
He
had
now
between
his
hands
power
over
a
fellow
creature's
life.
It
suited
him.
No
less
perfectly
did
it
suit
his
saturnine
better
half.
The
incident
was
quite
in
her
way
and
to
her
taste.
Some
women
would
have
been
terror
struck
to
see
a
gory
man
brought
in
over
their
threshold,
and
laid
down
in
their
hall
in
the
"howe
of
the
night."
There,
you
would
suppose,
was
subject
matter
for
hysterics.
No.
Mrs.
Yorke
went
into
hysterics
when
Jessie
would
not
leave
the
garden
to
come
to
her
knitting,
or
when
Martin
proposed
starting
for
Australia,
with
a
view
to
realize
freedom
and
escape
the
tyranny
of
Matthew;
but
an
attempted
murder
near
her
door
a
half
murdered
man
in
her
best
bed
set
her
straight,
cheered
her
spirits,
gave
her
cap
the
dash
of
a
turban.
Mrs.
Yorke
was
just
the
woman
who,
while
rendering
miserable
the
drudging
life
of
a
simple
maid
servant,
would
nurse
like
a
heroine
a
hospital
full
of
plague
patients.
She
almost
loved
Moore.
Her
tough
heart
almost
yearned
towards
him
when
she
found
him
committed
to
her
charge
left
in
her
arms,
as
dependent
on
her
as
her
youngest
born
in
the
cradle.
Had
she
seen
a
domestic
or
one
of
her
daughters
give
him
a
draught
of
water
or
smooth
his
pillow,
she
would
have
boxed
the
intruder's
ears.
She
chased
Jessie
and
Rose
from
the
upper
realm
of
the
house;
she
forbade
the
housemaids
to
set
their
foot
in
it.
Now,
if
the
accident
had
happened
at
the
rectory
gates,
and
old
Helstone
had
taken
in
the
martyr,
neither
Yorke
nor
his
wife
would
have
pitied
him.
They
would
have
adjudged
him
right
served
for
his
tyranny
and
meddling.
As
it
was,
he
became,
for
the
present,
the
apple
of
their
eye.
Strange!
Louis
Moore
was
permitted
to
come
to
sit
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
lean
over
the
pillow;
to
hold
his
brother's
hand,
and
press
his
pale
forehead
with
his
fraternal
lips;
and
Mrs.
Yorke
bore
it
well.
She
suffered
him
to
stay
half
the
day
there;
she
once
suffered
him
to
sit
up
all
night
in
the
chamber;
she
rose
herself
at
five
o'clock
of
a
wet
November
morning,
and
with
her
own
hands
lit
the
kitchen
fire,
and
made
the
brothers
a
breakfast,
and
served
it
to
them
herself.
Majestically
arrayed
in
a
boundless
flannel
wrapper,
a
shawl,
and
her
nightcap,
she
sat
and
watched
them
eat,
as
complacently
as
a
hen
beholds
her
chickens
feed.
Yet
she
gave
the
cook
warning
that
day
for
venturing
to
make
and
carry
up
to
Mr.
Moore
a
basin
of
sago
gruel;
and
the
housemaid
lost
her
favour
because,
when
Mr.
Louis
was
departing,
she
brought
him
his
surtout
aired
from
the
kitchen,
and,
like
a
"forward
piece"
as
she
was,
helped
him
on
with
it,
and
accepted
in
return
a
smile,
a
"Thank
you,
my
girl,"
and
a
shilling.
Two
ladies
called
one
day,
pale
and
anxious,
and
begged
earnestly,
humbly,
to
be
allowed
to
see
Mr.
Moore
one
instant.
Mrs.
Yorke
hardened
her
heart,
and
sent
them
packing
not
without
opprobrium.
But
how
was
it
when
Hortense
Moore
came?
Not
so
bad
as
might
have
been
expected.
The
whole
family
of
the
Moores
really
seemed
to
suit
Mrs.
Yorke
so
as
no
other
family
had
ever
suited
her.
Hortense
and
she
possessed
an
exhaustless
mutual
theme
of
conversation
in
the
corrupt
propensities
of
servants.
Their
views
of
this
class
were
similar;
they
watched
them
with
the
same
suspicion,
and
judged
them
with
the
same
severity.
Hortense,
too,
from
the
very
first
showed
no
manner
of
jealousy
of
Mrs.
Yorke's
attentions
to
Robert
she
let
her
keep
the
post
of
nurse
with
little
interference;
and,
for
herself,
found
ceaseless
occupation
in
fidgeting
about
the
house,
holding
the
kitchen
under
surveillance,
reporting
what
passed
there,
and,
in
short,
making
herself
generally
useful.
Visitors
they
both
of
them
agreed
in
excluding
sedulously
from
the
sickroom.
They
held
the
young
mill
owner
captive,
and
hardly
let
the
air
breathe
or
the
sun
shine
on
him.
Mr.
MacTurk,
the
surgeon
to
whom
Moore's
case
had
been
committed,
pronounced
his
wound
of
a
dangerous,
but,
he
trusted,
not
of
a
hopeless
character.
At
first
he
wished
to
place
with
him
a
nurse
of
his
own
selection;
but
this
neither
Mrs.
Yorke
nor
Hortense
would
hear
of.
They
promised
faithful
observance
of
directions.
He
was
left,
therefore,
for
the
present
in
their
hands.
Doubtless
they
executed
the
trust
to
the
best
of
their
ability;
but
something
got
wrong.
The
bandages
were
displaced
or
tampered
with;
great
loss
of
blood
followed.
MacTurk,
being
summoned,
came
with
steed
afoam.
He
was
one
of
those
surgeons
whom
it
is
dangerous
to
vex
abrupt
in
his
best
moods,
in
his
worst
savage.
On
seeing
Moore's
state
he
relieved
his
feelings
by
a
little
flowery
language,
with
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
strew
the
present
page.
A
bouquet
or
two
of
the
choicest
blossoms
fell
on
the
unperturbed
head
of
one
Mr.
Graves,
a
stony
young
assistant
he
usually
carried
about
with
him;
with
a
second
nosegay
he
gifted
another
young
gentleman
in
his
train
an
interesting
fac
simile
of
himself,
being
indeed
his
own
son;
but
the
full
corbeille
of
blushing
bloom
fell
to
the
lot
of
meddling
womankind,
en
masse.
For
the
best
part
of
one
winter
night
himself
and
satellites
were
busied
about
Moore.
There
at
his
bedside,
shut
up
alone
with
him
in
his
chamber,
they
wrought
and
wrangled
over
his
exhausted
frame.
They
three
were
on
one
side
of
the
bed,
and
Death
on
the
other.
The
conflict
was
sharp;
it
lasted
till
day
broke,
when
the
balance
between
the
belligerents
seemed
so
equal
that
both
parties
might
have
claimed
the
victory.
At
dawn
Graves
and
young
MacTurk
were
left
in
charge
of
the
patient,
while
the
senior
went
himself
in
search
of
additional
strength,
and
secured
it
in
the
person
of
Mrs.
Horsfall,
the
best
nurse
on
his
staff.
To
this
woman
he
gave
Moore
in
charge,
with
the
sternest
injunctions
respecting
the
responsibility
laid
on
her
shoulders.
She
took
this
responsibility
stolidly,
as
she
did
also
the
easy
chair
at
the
bedhead.
That
moment
she
began
her
reign.
Mrs.
Horsfall
had
one
virtue
orders
received
from
MacTurk
she
obeyed
to
the
letter.
The
ten
commandments
were
less
binding
in
her
eyes
than
her
surgeon's
dictum.
In
other
respects
she
was
no
woman,
but
a
dragon.
Hortense
Moore
fell
effaced
before
her;
Mrs.
Yorke
withdrew
crushed;
yet
both
these
women
were
personages
of
some
dignity
in
their
own
estimation,
and
of
some
bulk
in
the
estimation
of
others.
Perfectly
cowed
by
the
breadth,
the
height,
the
bone,
and
the
brawn
of
Mrs.
Horsfall,
they
retreated
to
the
back
parlour.
She,
for
her
part,
sat
upstairs
when
she
liked,
and
downstairs
when
she
preferred
it.
She
took
her
dram
three
times
a
day,
and
her
pipe
of
tobacco
four
times.
As
to
Moore,
no
one
now
ventured
to
inquire
about
him.
Mrs.
Horsfall
had
him
at
dry
nurse.
It
was
she
who
was
to
do
for
him,
and
the
general
conjecture
now
ran
that
she
did
for
him
accordingly.
Morning
and
evening
MacTurk
came
to
see
him.
His
case,
thus
complicated
by
a
new
mischance,
was
become
one
of
interest
in
the
surgeon's
eyes.
He
regarded
him
as
a
damaged
piece
of
clockwork,
which
it
would
be
creditable
to
his
skill
to
set
agoing
again.
Graves
and
young
MacTurk
Moore's
sole
other
visitors
contemplated
him
in
the
light
in
which
they
were
wont
to
contemplate
the
occupant
for
the
time
being
of
the
dissecting
room
at
Stilbro'
Infirmary.
Robert
Moore
had
a
pleasant
time
of
it
in
pain,
in
danger,
too
weak
to
move,
almost
too
weak
to
speak,
a
sort
of
giantess
his
keeper,
the
three
surgeons
his
sole
society.
Thus
he
lay
through
the
diminishing
days
and
lengthening
nights
of
the
whole
drear
month
of
November.
In
the
commencement
of
his
captivity
Moore
used
feebly
to
resist
Mrs.
Horsfall.
He
hated
the
sight
of
her
rough
bulk,
and
dreaded
the
contact
of
her
hard
hands;
but
she
taught
him
docility
in
a
trice.
She
made
no
account
whatever
of
his
six
feet,
his
manly
thews
and
sinews;
she
turned
him
in
his
bed
as
another
woman
would
have
turned
a
babe
in
its
cradle.
When
he
was
good
she
addressed
him
as
"my
dear"
and
"honey,"
and
when
he
was
bad
she
sometimes
shook
him.
Did
he
attempt
to
speak
when
MacTurk
was
there,
she
lifted
her
hand
and
bade
him
"Hush!"
like
a
nurse
checking
a
forward
child.
If
she
had
not
smoked,
if
she
had
not
taken
gin,
it
would
have
been
better,
he
thought;
but
she
did
both.
Once,
in
her
absence,
he
intimated
to
MacTurk
that
"that
woman
was
a
dram
drinker."
"Pooh!
my
dear
sir,
they
are
all
so,"
was
the
reply
he
got
for
his
pains.
"But
Horsfall
has
this
virtue,"
added
the
surgeon
"drunk
or
sober,
she
always
remembers
to
obey
me."
At
length
the
latter
autumn
passed;
its
fogs,
its
rains
withdrew
from
England
their
mourning
and
their
tears;
its
winds
swept
on
to
sigh
over
lands
far
away.
Behind
November
came
deep
winter
clearness,
stillness,
frost
accompanying.
A
calm
day
had
settled
into
a
crystalline
evening.
The
world
wore
a
North
Pole
colouring;
all
its
lights
and
tints
looked
like
the
reflets[A]
of
white,
or
violet,
or
pale
green
gems.
The
hills
wore
a
lilac
blue;
the
setting
sun
had
purple
in
its
red;
the
sky
was
ice,
all
silvered
azure;
when
the
stars
rose,
they
were
of
white
crystal,
not
gold;
gray,
or
cerulean,
or
faint
emerald
hues
cool,
pure,
and
transparent
tinged
the
mass
of
the
landscape.
[A]
Find
me
an
English
word
as
good,
reader,
and
I
will
gladly
dispense
with
the
French
word.
"Reflections"
won't
do.
What
is
this
by
itself
in
a
wood
no
longer
green,
no
longer
even
russet,
a
wood
neutral
tint
this
dark
blue
moving
object?
Why,
it
is
a
schoolboy
a
Briarfield
grammar
school
boy
who
has
left
his
companions,
now
trudging
home
by
the
highroad,
and
is
seeking
a
certain
tree,
with
a
certain
mossy
mound
at
its
root,
convenient
as
a
seat.
Why
is
he
lingering
here?
The
air
is
cold
and
the
time
wears
late.
He
sits
down.
What
is
he
thinking
about?
Does
he
feel
the
chaste
charm
Nature
wears
to
night?
A
pearl
white
moon
smiles
through
the
gray
trees;
does
he
care
for
her
smile?
Impossible
to
say;
for
he
is
silent,
and
his
countenance
does
not
speak.
As
yet
it
is
no
mirror
to
reflect
sensation,
but
rather
a
mask
to
conceal
it.
This
boy
is
a
stripling
of
fifteen
slight,
and
tall
of
his
years.
In
his
face
there
is
as
little
of
amenity
as
of
servility,
his
eye
seems
prepared
to
note
any
incipient
attempt
to
control
or
overreach
him,
and
the
rest
of
his
features
indicate
faculties
alert
for
resistance.
Wise
ushers
avoid
unnecessary
interference
with
that
lad.
To
break
him
in
by
severity
would
be
a
useless
attempt;
to
win
him
by
flattery
would
be
an
effort
worse
than
useless.
He
is
best
let
alone.
Time
will
educate
and
experience
train
him.
Professedly
Martin
Yorke
(it
is
a
young
Yorke,
of
course)
tramples
on
the
name
of
poetry.
Talk
sentiment
to
him,
and
you
would
be
answered
by
sarcasm.
Here
he
is,
wandering
alone,
waiting
duteously
on
Nature,
while
she
unfolds
a
page
of
stern,
of
silent,
and
of
solemn
poetry
beneath
his
attentive
gaze.
Being
seated,
he
takes
from
his
satchel
a
book
not
the
Latin
grammar,
but
a
contraband
volume
of
fairy
tales.
There
will
be
light
enough
yet
for
an
hour
to
serve
his
keen
young
vision.
Besides,
the
moon
waits
on
him;
her
beam,
dim
and
vague
as
yet,
fills
the
glade
where
he
sits.
He
reads.
He
is
led
into
a
solitary
mountain
region;
all
round
him
is
rude
and
desolate,
shapeless,
and
almost
colourless.
He
hears
bells
tinkle
on
the
wind.
Forth
riding
from
the
formless
folds
of
the
mist
dawns
on
him
the
brightest
vision
a
green
robed
lady,
on
a
snow
white
palfrey.
He
sees
her
dress,
her
gems,
and
her
steed.
She
arrests
him
with
some
mysterious
question.
He
is
spell
bound,
and
must
follow
her
into
fairyland.
A
second
legend
bears
him
to
the
sea
shore.
There
tumbles
in
a
strong
tide,
boiling
at
the
base
of
dizzy
cliffs.
It
rains
and
blows.
A
reef
of
rocks,
black
and
rough,
stretches
far
into
the
sea.
All
along,
and
among,
and
above
these
crags
dash
and
flash,
sweep
and
leap,
swells,
wreaths,
drifts
of
snowy
spray.
Some
lone
wanderer
is
out
on
these
rocks,
treading
with
cautious
step
the
wet,
wild
seaweed;
glancing
down
into
hollows
where
the
brine
lies
fathoms
deep
and
emerald
clear,
and
seeing
there
wilder
and
stranger
and
huger
vegetation
than
is
found
on
land,
with
treasure
of
shells
some
green,
some
purple,
some
pearly
clustered
in
the
curls
of
the
snaky
plants.
He
hears
a
cry.
Looking
up
and
forward,
he
sees,
at
the
bleak
point
of
the
reef,
a
tall,
pale
thing
shaped
like
man,
but
made
of
spray
transparent,
tremulous,
awful.
It
stands
not
alone.
They
are
all
human
figures
that
wanton
in
the
rocks
a
crowd
of
foam
women
a
band
of
white,
evanescent
Nereids.
Hush!
Shut
the
book;
hide
it
in
the
satchel.
Martin
hears
a
tread.
He
listens.
No
yes.
Once
more
the
dead
leaves,
lightly
crushed,
rustle
on
the
wood
path.
Martin
watches;
the
trees
part,
and
a
woman
issues
forth.
She
is
a
lady
dressed
in
dark
silk,
a
veil
covering
her
face.
Martin
never
met
a
lady
in
this
wood
before
nor
any
female,
save,
now
and
then,
a
village
girl
come
to
gather
nuts.
To
night
the
apparition
does
not
displease
him.
He
observes,
as
she
approaches,
that
she
is
neither
old
nor
plain,
but,
on
the
contrary,
very
youthful;
and,
but
that
he
now
recognizes
her
for
one
whom
he
has
often
wilfully
pronounced
ugly,
he
would
deem
that
he
discovered
traits
of
beauty
behind
the
thin
gauze
of
that
veil.
She
passes
him
and
says
nothing.
He
knew
she
would.
All
women
are
proud
monkeys,
and
he
knows
no
more
conceited
doll
than
that
Caroline
Helstone.
The
thought
is
hardly
hatched
in
his
mind
when
the
lady
retraces
those
two
steps
she
had
got
beyond
him,
and
raising
her
veil,
reposes
her
glance
on
his
face,
while
she
softly
asks,
"Are
you
one
of
Mr.
Yorke's
sons?"
No
human
evidence
would
ever
have
been
able
to
persuade
Martin
Yorke
that
he
blushed
when
thus
addressed;
yet
blush
he
did,
to
the
ears.
"I
am,"
he
said
bluntly,
and
encouraged
himself
to
wonder,
superciliously,
what
would
come
next.
"You
are
Martin,
I
think?"
was
the
observation
that
followed.
It
could
not
have
been
more
felicitous.
It
was
a
simple
sentence
very
artlessly,
a
little
timidly,
pronounced;
but
it
chimed
in
harmony
to
the
youth's
nature.
It
stilled
him
like
a
note
of
music.
Martin
had
a
keen
sense
of
his
personality;
he
felt
it
right
and
sensible
that
the
girl
should
discriminate
him
from
his
brothers.
Like
his
father,
he
hated
ceremony.
It
was
acceptable
to
hear
a
lady
address
him
as
"Martin,"
and
not
Mr.
Martin
or
Master
Martin,
which
form
would
have
lost
her
his
good
graces
for
ever.
Worse,
if
possible,
than
ceremony
was
the
other
extreme
of
slipshod
familiarity.
The
slight
tone
of
bashfulness,
the
scarcely
perceptible
hesitation,
was
considered
perfectly
in
place.
"I
am
Martin,"
he
said.
"Are
your
father
and
mother
well?"
(it
was
lucky
she
did
not
say
papa
and
mamma;
that
would
have
undone
all);
"and
Rose
and
Jessie?"
"I
suppose
so."
"My
cousin
Hortense
is
still
at
Briarmains?"
"Oh
yes."
Martin
gave
a
comic
half
smile
and
demi
groan.
The
half
smile
was
responded
to
by
the
lady,
who
could
guess
in
what
sort
of
odour
Hortense
was
likely
to
be
held
by
the
young
Yorkes.
"Does
your
mother
like
her?"
"They
suit
so
well
about
the
servants
they
can't
help
liking
each
other."
"It
is
cold
to
night."
"Why
are
you
out
so
late?"
"I
lost
my
way
in
this
wood."
Now,
indeed,
Martin
allowed
himself
a
refreshing
laugh
of
scorn.
"Lost
your
way
in
the
mighty
forest
of
Briarmains!
You
deserve
never
more
to
find
it."
"I
never
was
here
before,
and
I
believe
I
am
trespassing
now.
You
might
inform
against
me
if
you
chose,
Martin,
and
have
me
fined.
It
is
your
father's
wood."
"I
should
think
I
knew
that.
But
since
you
are
so
simple
as
to
lose
your
way,
I
will
guide
you
out."
"You
need
not.
I
have
got
into
the
track
now.
I
shall
be
right.
Martin"
(a
little
quickly),
"how
is
Mr.
Moore?"
Martin
had
heard
certain
rumours;
it
struck
him
that
it
might
be
amusing
to
make
an
experiment.
"Going
to
die.
Nothing
can
save
him.
All
hope
flung
overboard!"
She
put
her
veil
aside.
She
looked
into
his
eyes,
and
said,
"To
die!"
"To
die.
All
along
of
the
women,
my
mother
and
the
rest.
They
did
something
about
his
bandages
that
finished
everything.
He
would
have
got
better
but
for
them.
I
am
sure
they
should
be
arrested,
cribbed,
tried,
and
brought
in
for
Botany
Bay,
at
the
very
least."
The
questioner,
perhaps,
did
nor
hear
this
judgment.
She
stood
motionless.
In
two
minutes,
without
another
word,
she
moved
forwards;
no
good
night,
no
further
inquiry.
This
was
not
amusing,
nor
what
Martin
had
calculated
on.
He
expected
something
dramatic
and
demonstrative.
It
was
hardly
worth
while
to
frighten
the
girl
if
she
would
not
entertain
him
in
return.
He
called,
"Miss
Helstone!"
She
did
not
hear
or
turn.
He
hastened
after
and
overtook
her.
"Come;
are
you
uneasy
about
what
I
said?"
"You
know
nothing
about
death,
Martin;
you
are
too
young
for
me
to
talk
to
concerning
such
a
thing."
"Did
you
believe
me?
It's
all
flummery!
Moore
eats
like
three
men.
They
are
always
making
sago
or
tapioca
or
something
good
for
him.
I
never
go
into
the
kitchen
but
there
is
a
saucepan
on
the
fire,
cooking
him
some
dainty.
I
think
I
will
play
the
old
soldier,
and
be
fed
on
the
fat
of
the
land
like
him."
"Martin!
Martin!"
Here
her
voice
trembled,
and
she
stopped.
"It
is
exceedingly
wrong
of
you,
Martin.
You
have
almost
killed
me."
Again
she
stopped.
She
leaned
against
a
tree,
trembling,
shuddering,
and
as
pale
as
death.
Martin
contemplated
her
with
inexpressible
curiosity.
In
one
sense
it
was,
as
he
would
have
expressed
it,
"nuts"
to
him
to
see
this.
It
told
him
so
much,
and
he
was
beginning
to
have
a
great
relish
for
discovering
secrets.
In
another
sense
it
reminded
him
of
what
he
had
once
felt
when
he
had
heard
a
blackbird
lamenting
for
her
nestlings,
which
Matthew
had
crushed
with
a
stone,
and
that
was
not
a
pleasant
feeling.
Unable
to
find
anything
very
appropriate
to
say
in
order
to
comfort
her,
he
began
to
cast
about
in
his
mind
what
he
could
do.
He
smiled.
The
lad's
smile
gave
wondrous
transparency
to
his
physiognomy.
"Eureka!"
he
cried.
"I'll
set
all
straight
by
and
by.
You
are
better
now,
Miss
Caroline.
Walk
forward,"
he
urged.
Not
reflecting
that
it
would
be
more
difficult
for
Miss
Helstone
than
for
himself
to
climb
a
wall
or
penetrate
a
hedge,
he
piloted
her
by
a
short
cut
which
led
to
no
gate.
The
consequence
was
he
had
to
help
her
over
some
formidable
obstacles,
and
while
he
railed
at
her
for
helplessness,
he
perfectly
liked
to
feel
himself
of
use.
"Martin,
before
we
separate,
assure
me
seriously,
and
on
your
word
of
honour,
that
Mr.
Moore
is
better."
"How
very
much
you
think
of
that
Moore!"
"No
but
many
of
his
friends
may
ask
me,
and
I
wish
to
be
able
to
give
an
authentic
answer."
"You
may
tell
them
he
is
well
enough,
only
idle.
You
may
tell
them
that
he
takes
mutton
chops
for
dinner,
and
the
best
of
arrowroot
for
supper.
I
intercepted
a
basin
myself
one
night
on
its
way
upstairs,
and
ate
half
of
it."
"And
who
waits
on
him,
Martin?
who
nurses
him?"
"Nurses
him?
The
great
baby!
Why,
a
woman
as
round
and
big
as
our
largest
water
butt
a
rough,
hard
favoured
old
girl.
I
make
no
doubt
she
leads
him
a
rich
life.
Nobody
else
is
let
near
him.
He
is
chiefly
in
the
dark.
It
is
my
belief
she
knocks
him
about
terribly
in
that
chamber.
I
listen
at
the
wall
sometimes
when
I
am
in
bed,
and
I
think
I
hear
her
thumping
him.
You
should
see
her
fist.
She
could
hold
half
a
dozen
hands
like
yours
in
her
one
palm.
After
all,
notwithstanding
the
chops
and
jellies
he
gets,
I
would
not
be
in
his
shoes.
In
fact,
it
is
my
private
opinion
that
she
eats
most
of
what
goes
up
on
the
tray
to
Mr.
Moore.
I
wish
she
may
not
be
starving
him."
Profound
silence
and
meditation
on
Caroline's
part,
and
a
sly
watchfulness
on
Martin's.
"You
never
see
him,
I
suppose,
Martin?"
"I?
No.
I
don't
care
to
see
him,
for
my
own
part."
Silence
again.
"Did
not
you
come
to
our
house
once
with
Mrs.
Pryor,
about
five
weeks
since,
to
ask
after
him?"
again
inquired
Martin.
"Yes."
"I
dare
say
you
wished
to
be
shown
upstairs?"
"We
did
wish
it.
We
entreated
it;
but
your
mother
declined."
"Ay!
she
declined.
I
heard
it
all.
She
treated
you
as
it
is
her
pleasure
to
treat
visitors
now
and
then.
She
behaved
to
you
rudely
and
harshly."
"She
was
not
kind;
for
you
know,
Martin,
we
are
relations,
and
it
is
natural
we
should
take
an
interest
in
Mr.
Moore.
But
here
we
must
part;
we
are
at
your
father's
gate."
"Very
well,
what
of
that?
I
shall
walk
home
with
you."
"They
will
miss
you,
and
wonder
where
you
are."
"Let
them.
I
can
take
care
of
myself,
I
suppose."
Martin
knew
that
he
had
already
incurred
the
penalty
of
a
lecture,
and
dry
bread
for
his
tea.
No
matter;
the
evening
had
furnished
him
with
an
adventure.
It
was
better
than
muffins
and
toast.
He
walked
home
with
Caroline.
On
the
way
he
promised
to
see
Mr.
Moore,
in
spite
of
the
dragon
who
guarded
his
chamber,
and
appointed
an
hour
on
the
next
day
when
Caroline
was
to
come
to
Briarmains
Wood
and
get
tidings
of
him.
He
would
meet
her
at
a
certain
tree.
The
scheme
led
to
nothing;
still
he
liked
it.
Having
reached
home,
the
dry
bread
and
the
lecture
were
duly
administered
to
him,
and
he
was
dismissed
to
bed
at
an
early
hour.
He
accepted
his
punishment
with
the
toughest
stoicism.
Ere
ascending
to
his
chamber
he
paid
a
secret
visit
to
the
dining
room,
a
still,
cold,
stately
apartment,
seldom
used,
for
the
family
customarily
dined
in
the
back
parlour.
He
stood
before
the
mantelpiece,
and
lifted
his
candle
to
two
pictures
hung
above
female
heads:
one,
a
type
of
serene
beauty,
happy
and
innocent;
the
other,
more
lovely,
but
forlorn
and
desperate.
"She
looked
like
that,"
he
said,
gazing
on
the
latter
sketch,
"when
she
sobbed,
turned
white,
and
leaned
against
the
tree."
"I
suppose,"
he
pursued,
when
he
was
in
his
room,
and
seated
on
the
edge
of
his
pallet
bed
"I
suppose
she
is
what
they
call
'in
love'
yes,
in
love
with
that
long
thing
in
the
next
chamber.
Whisht!
is
that
Horsfall
clattering
him?
I
wonder
he
does
not
yell
out.
It
really
sounds
as
if
she
had
fallen
on
him
tooth
and
nail;
but
I
suppose
she
is
making
the
bed.
I
saw
her
at
it
once.
She
hit
into
the
mattresses
as
if
she
was
boxing.
It
is
queer,
Zillah
(they
call
her
Zillah)
Zillah
Horsfall
is
a
woman,
and
Caroline
Helstone
is
a
woman;
they
are
two
individuals
of
the
same
species
not
much
alike
though.
Is
she
a
pretty
girl,
that
Caroline?
I
suspect
she
is;
very
nice
to
look
at
something
so
clear
in
her
face,
so
soft
in
her
eyes.
I
approve
of
her
looking
at
me;
it
does
me
good.
She
has
long
eyelashes.
Their
shadow
seems
to
rest
where
she
gazes,
and
to
instil
peace
and
thought.
If
she
behaves
well,
and
continues
to
suit
me
as
she
has
suited
me
to
day,
I
may
do
her
a
good
turn.
I
rather
relish
the
notion
of
circumventing
my
mother
and
that
ogress
old
Horsfall.
Not
that
I
like
humouring
Moore;
but
whatever
I
do
I'll
be
paid
for,
and
in
coin
of
my
own
choosing.
I
know
what
reward
I
will
claim
one
displeasing
to
Moore,
and
agreeable
to
myself."
He
turned
into
bed.
It
was
necessary
to
the
arrangement
of
Martin's
plan
that
he
should
stay
at
home
that
day.
Accordingly,
he
found
no
appetite
for
breakfast,
and
just
about
school
time
took
a
severe
pain
about
his
heart,
which
rendered
it
advisable
that,
instead
of
setting
out
to
the
grammar
school
with
Mark,
he
should
succeed
to
his
father's
arm
chair
by
the
fireside,
and
also
to
his
morning
paper.
This
point
being
satisfactorily
settled,
and
Mark
being
gone
to
Mr.
Summer's
class,
and
Matthew
and
Mr.
Yorke
withdrawn
to
the
counting
house,
three
other
exploits
nay,
four
remained
to
be
achieved.
The
first
of
these
was
to
realize
the
breakfast
he
had
not
yet
tasted,
and
with
which
his
appetite
of
fifteen
could
ill
afford
to
dispense;
the
second,
third,
fourth,
to
get
his
mother,
Miss
Moore,
and
Mrs.
Horsfall
successfully
out
of
the
way
before
four
o'clock
that
afternoon.
The
first
was,
for
the
present,
the
most
pressing,
since
the
work
before
him
demanded
an
amount
of
energy
which
the
present
empty
condition
of
his
youthful
stomach
did
not
seem
likely
to
supply.
Martin
knew
the
way
to
the
larder,
and
knowing
this
way
he
took
it.
The
servants
were
in
the
kitchen,
breakfasting
solemnly
with
closed
doors;
his
mother
and
Miss
Moore
were
airing
themselves
on
the
lawn,
and
discussing
the
closed
doors
aforesaid.
Martin,
safe
in
the
larder,
made
fastidious
selection
from
its
stores.
His
breakfast
had
been
delayed;
he
was
determined
it
should
be
recherche.
It
appeared
to
him
that
a
variety
on
his
usual
somewhat
insipid
fare
of
bread
and
milk
was
both
desirable
and
advisable;
the
savoury
and
the
salutary
he
thought
might
be
combined.
There
was
store
of
rosy
apples
laid
in
straw
upon
a
shelf;
he
picked
out
three.
There
was
pastry
upon
a
dish;
he
selected
an
apricot
puff
and
a
damson
tart.
On
the
plain
household
bread
his
eye
did
not
dwell;
but
he
surveyed
with
favour
some
currant
tea
cakes,
and
condescended
to
make
choice
of
one.
Thanks
to
his
clasp
knife,
he
was
able
to
appropriate
a
wing
of
fowl
and
a
slice
of
ham;
a
cantlet
of
cold
custard
pudding
he
thought
would
harmonize
with
these
articles;
and
having
made
this
final
addition
to
his
booty,
he
at
length
sallied
forth
into
the
hall.
He
was
already
half
way
across
three
steps
more
would
have
anchored
him
in
the
harbour
of
the
back
parlour
when
the
front
door
opened,
and
there
stood
Matthew.
Better
far
had
it
been
the
Old
Gentleman,
in
full
equipage
of
horns,
hoofs,
and
tail.
Matthew,
sceptic
and
scoffer,
had
already
failed
to
subscribe
a
prompt
belief
in
that
pain
about
the
heart.
He
had
muttered
some
words,
amongst
which
the
phrase
"shamming
Abraham"
had
been
very
distinctly
audible,
and
the
succession
to
the
armchair
and
newspaper
had
appeared
to
affect
him
with
mental
spasms.
The
spectacle
now
before
him
the
apples,
the
tarts,
the
tea
cakes,
the
fowl,
ham,
and
pudding
offered
evidence
but
too
well
calculated
to
inflate
his
opinion
of
his
own
sagacity.
Martin
paused
interdit
one
minute,
one
instant;
the
next
he
knew
his
ground,
and
pronounced
all
well.
With
the
true
perspicacity
des
ames
elites,
he
at
once
saw
how
this
at
first
sight
untoward
event
might
be
turned
to
excellent
account.
He
saw
how
it
might
be
so
handled
as
to
secure
the
accomplishment
of
his
second
task
namely,
the
disposal
of
his
mother.
He
knew
that
a
collision
between
him
and
Matthew
always
suggested
to
Mrs.
Yorke
the
propriety
of
a
fit
of
hysterics.
He
further
knew
that,
on
the
principle
of
calm
succeeding
to
storm,
after
a
morning
of
hysterics
his
mother
was
sure
to
indulge
in
an
afternoon
of
bed.
This
would
accommodate
him
perfectly.
The
collision
duly
took
place
in
the
hall.
A
dry
laugh,
an
insulting
sneer,
a
contemptuous
taunt,
met
by
a
nonchalant
but
most
cutting
reply,
were
the
signals.
They
rushed
at
it.
Martin,
who
usually
made
little
noise
on
these
occasions,
made
a
great
deal
now.
In
flew
the
servants,
Mrs.
Yorke,
Miss
Moore.
No
female
hand
could
separate
them.
Mr.
Yorke
was
summoned.
"Sons,"
said
he,
"one
of
you
must
leave
my
roof
if
this
occurs
again.
I
will
have
no
Cain
and
Abel
strife
here."
Martin
now
allowed
himself
to
be
taken
off.
He
had
been
hurt;
he
was
the
youngest
and
slightest.
He
was
quite
cool,
in
no
passion;
he
even
smiled,
content
that
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
labour
he
had
set
himself
was
over.
Once
he
seemed
to
flag
in
the
course
of
the
morning.
"It
is
not
worth
while
to
bother
myself
for
that
Caroline,"
he
remarked.
But
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
he
was
again
in
the
dining
room,
looking
at
the
head
with
dishevelled
tresses,
and
eyes
turbid
with
despair.
"Yes,"
he
said,
"I
made
her
sob,
shudder,
almost
faint.
I'll
see
her
smile
before
I've
done
with
her;
besides,
I
want
to
outwit
all
these
womenites."
Directly
after
dinner
Mrs.
Yorke
fulfilled
her
son's
calculation
by
withdrawing
to
her
chamber.
Now
for
Hortense.
That
lady
was
just
comfortably
settled
to
stocking
mending
in
the
back
parlour,
when
Martin
laying
down
a
book
which,
stretched
on
the
sofa
(he
was
still
indisposed,
according
to
his
own
account),
he
had
been
perusing
in
all
the
voluptuous
ease
of
a
yet
callow
pacha
lazily
introduced
some
discourse
about
Sarah,
the
maid
at
the
Hollow.
In
the
course
of
much
verbal
meandering
he
insinuated
information
that
this
damsel
was
said
to
have
three
suitors
Frederic
Murgatroyd,
Jeremiah
Pighills,
and
John
of
Mally's
of
Hannah's
of
Deb's;
and
that
Miss
Mann
had
affirmed
she
knew
for
a
fact
that,
now
the
girl
was
left
in
sole
charge
of
the
cottage,
she
often
had
her
swains
to
meals,
and
entertained
them
with
the
best
the
house
afforded.
It
needed
no
more.
Hortense
could
not
have
lived
another
hour
without
betaking
herself
to
the
scene
of
these
nefarious
transactions,
and
inspecting
the
state
of
matters
in
person.
Mrs.
Horsfall
remained.
Martin,
master
of
the
field
now,
extracted
from
his
mother's
work
basket
a
bunch
of
keys;
with
these
he
opened
the
sideboard
cupboard,
produced
thence
a
black
bottle
and
a
small
glass,
placed
them
on
the
table,
nimbly
mounted
the
stairs,
made
for
Mr.
Moore's
door,
tapped;
the
nurse
opened.
"If
you
please,
ma'am,
you
are
invited
to
step
into
the
back
parlour
and
take
some
refreshment.
You
will
not
be
disturbed;
the
family
are
out."
He
watched
her
down;
he
watched
her
in;
himself
shut
the
door.
He
knew
she
was
safe.
The
hard
work
was
done;
now
for
the
pleasure.
He
snatched
his
cap,
and
away
for
the
wood.
It
was
yet
but
half
past
three.
It
had
been
a
fine
morning,
but
the
sky
looked
dark
now.
It
was
beginning
to
snow;
the
wind
blew
cold;
the
wood
looked
dismal,
the
old
tree
grim.
Yet
Martin
approved
the
shadow
on
his
path.
He
found
a
charm
in
the
spectral
aspect
of
the
doddered
oak.
He
had
to
wait.
To
and
fro
he
walked,
while
the
flakes
fell
faster;
and
the
wind,
which
at
first
had
but
moaned,
pitifully
howled.
"She
is
long
in
coming,"
he
muttered,
as
he
glanced
along
the
narrow
track.
"I
wonder,"
he
subjoined,
"what
I
wish
to
see
her
so
much
for?
She
is
not
coming
for
me.
But
I
have
power
over
her,
and
I
want
her
to
come
that
I
may
use
that
power."
He
continued
his
walk.
"Now,"
he
resumed,
when
a
further
period
had
elapsed,
"if
she
fails
to
come,
I
shall
hate
and
scorn
her."
It
struck
four.
He
heard
the
church
clock
far
away.
A
step
so
quick,
so
light,
that,
but
for
the
rustling
of
leaves,
it
would
scarcely
have
sounded
on
the
wood
walk,
checked
his
impatience.
The
wind
blew
fiercely
now,
and
the
thickening
white
storm
waxed
bewildering;
but
on
she
came,
and
not
dismayed.
"Well,
Martin,"
she
said
eagerly,
"how
is
he?"
"It
is
queer
how
she
thinks
of
him,"
reflected
Martin.
"The
blinding
snow
and
bitter
cold
are
nothing
to
her,
I
believe;
yet
she
is
but
a
'chitty
faced
creature,'
as
my
mother
would
say.
I
could
find
in
my
heart
to
wish
I
had
a
cloak
to
wrap
her
in."
Thus
meditating
to
himself,
he
neglected
to
answer
Miss
Helstone.
"You
have
seen
him?"
"No."
"Oh!
you
promised
you
would."
"I
mean
to
do
better
by
you
than
that.
Didn't
I
say
I
don't
care
to
see
him?"
"But
now
it
will
be
so
long
before
I
get
to
know
any
thing
certain
about
him,
and
I
am
sick
of
waiting.
Martin,
do
see
him,
and
give
him
Caroline
Helstone's
regards,
and
say
she
wished
to
know
how
he
was,
and
if
anything
could
be
done
for
his
comfort."
"I
won't."
"You
are
changed.
You
were
so
friendly
last
night."
"Come,
we
must
not
stand
in
this
wood;
it
is
too
cold."
"But
before
I
go
promise
me
to
come
again
to
morrow
with
news."
"No
such
thing.
I
am
much
too
delicate
to
make
and
keep
such
appointments
in
the
winter
season.
If
you
knew
what
a
pain
I
had
in
my
chest
this
morning,
and
how
I
went
without
breakfast,
and
was
knocked
down
besides,
you'd
feel
the
impropriety
of
bringing
me
here
in
the
snow.
Come,
I
say."
"Are
you
really
delicate,
Martin?"
"Don't
I
look
so?"
"You
have
rosy
cheeks."
"That's
hectic.
Will
you
come
or
you
won't?"
"Where?"
"With
me.
I
was
a
fool
not
to
bring
a
cloak.
I
would
have
made
you
cosy."
"You
are
going
home;
my
nearest
road
lies
in
the
opposite
direction."
"Put
your
arm
through
mine;
I'll
take
care
of
you."
"But
the
wall
the
hedge
it
is
such
hard
work
climbing,
and
you
are
too
slender
and
young
to
help
me
without
hurting
yourself."
"You
shall
go
through
the
gate."
"But
"
"But,
but
will
you
trust
me
or
not?"
She
looked
into
his
face.
"I
think
I
will.
Anything
rather
than
return
as
anxious
as
I
came."
"I
can't
answer
for
that.
This,
however,
I
promise
you:
be
ruled
by
me,
and
you
shall
see
Moore
yourself."
"See
him
myself?"
"Yourself."
"But,
dear
Martin,
does
he
know?"
"Ah!
I'm
dear
now.
No,
he
doesn't
know."
"And
your
mother
and
the
others?"
"All
is
right."
Caroline
fell
into
a
long,
silent
fit
of
musing,
but
still
she
walked
on
with
her
guide.
They
came
in
sight
of
Briarmains.
"Have
you
made
up
your
mind?"
he
asked.
She
was
silent.
"Decide;
we
are
just
on
the
spot.
I
won't
see
him
that
I
tell
you
except
to
announce
your
arrival."
"Martin,
you
are
a
strange
boy,
and
this
is
a
strange
step;
but
all
I
feel
is
and
has
been,
for
a
long
time,
strange.
I
will
see
him."
"Having
said
that,
you
will
neither
hesitate
nor
retract?"
"No."
"Here
we
are,
then.
Do
not
be
afraid
of
passing
the
parlour
window;
no
one
will
see
you.
My
father
and
Matthew
are
at
the
mill,
Mark
is
at
school,
the
servants
are
in
the
back
kitchen,
Miss
Moore
is
at
the
cottage,
my
mother
in
her
bed,
and
Mrs.
Horsfall
in
paradise.
Observe
I
need
not
ring.
I
open
the
door;
the
hall
is
empty,
the
staircase
quiet;
so
is
the
gallery.
The
whole
house
and
all
its
inhabitants
are
under
a
spell,
which
I
will
not
break
till
you
are
gone."
"Martin,
I
trust
you."
"You
never
said
a
better
word.
Let
me
take
your
shawl.
I
will
shake
off
the
snow
and
dry
it
for
you.
You
are
cold
and
wet.
Never
mind;
there
is
a
fire
upstairs.
Are
you
ready?"
"Yes."
"Follow
me."
He
left
his
shoes
on
the
mat,
mounted
the
stair
unshod.
Caroline
stole
after,
with
noiseless
step.
There
was
a
gallery,
and
there
was
a
passage;
at
the
end
of
that
passage
Martin
paused
before
a
door
and
tapped.
He
had
to
tap
twice
thrice.
A
voice,
known
to
one
listener,
at
last
said,
"Come
in."
The
boy
entered
briskly.
"Mr.
Moore,
a
lady
called
to
inquire
after
you.
None
of
the
women
were
about.
It
is
washing
day,
and
the
maids
are
over
the
crown
of
the
head
in
soap
suds
in
the
back
kitchen,
so
I
asked
her
to
step
up."
"Up
here,
sir?"
"Up
here,
sir;
but
if
you
object,
she
shall
go
down
again."
"Is
this
a
place
or
am
I
a
person
to
bring
a
lady
to,
you
absurd
lad?"
"No;
so
I'll
take
her
off."
"Martin,
you
will
stay
here.
Who
is
she?"
"Your
grandmother
from
that
chateau
on
the
Scheldt
Miss
Moore
talks
about."
"Martin,"
said
the
softest
whisper
at
the
door,
"don't
be
foolish."
"Is
she
there?"
inquired
Moore
hastily.
He
had
caught
an
imperfect
sound.
"She
is
there,
fit
to
faint.
She
is
standing
on
the
mat,
shocked
at
your
want
of
filial
affection."
"Martin,
you
are
an
evil
cross
between
an
imp
and
a
page.
What
is
she
like?"
"More
like
me
than
you;
for
she
is
young
and
beautiful."
"You
are
to
show
her
forward.
Do
you
hear?"
"Come,
Miss
Caroline."
"Miss
Caroline!"
repeated
Moore.
And
when
Miss
Caroline
entered
she
was
encountered
in
the
middle
of
the
chamber
by
a
tall,
thin,
wasted
figure,
who
took
both
her
hands.
"I
give
you
a
quarter
of
an
hour,"
said
Martin,
as
he
withdrew,
"no
more.
Say
what
you
have
to
say
in
that
time.
Till
it
is
past
I
will
wait
in
the
gallery;
nothing
shall
approach;
I'll
see
you
safe
away.
Should
you
persist
in
staying
longer,
I
leave
you
to
your
fate."
He
shut
the
door.
In
the
gallery
he
was
as
elate
as
a
king.
He
had
never
been
engaged
in
an
adventure
he
liked
so
well,
for
no
adventure
had
ever
invested
him
with
so
much
importance
or
inspired
him
with
so
much
interest.
"You
are
come
at
last,"
said
the
meagre
man,
gazing
on
his
visitress
with
hollow
eyes.
"Did
you
expect
me
before?"
"For
a
month,
near
two
months,
we
have
been
very
near;
and
I
have
been
in
sad
pain,
and
danger,
and
misery,
Cary."
"I
could
not
come."
"Couldn't
you?
But
the
rectory
and
Briarmains
are
very
near
not
two
miles
apart."
There
was
pain
and
there
was
pleasure
in
the
girl's
face
as
she
listened
to
these
implied
reproaches.
It
was
sweet,
it
was
bitter
to
defend
herself.
"When
I
say
I
could
not
come,
I
mean
I
could
not
see
you;
for
I
came
with
mamma
the
very
day
we
heard
what
had
happened.
Mr.
MacTurk
then
told
us
it
was
impossible
to
admit
any
stranger."
"But
afterwards
every
fine
afternoon
these
many
weeks
past
I
have
waited
and
listened.
Something
here,
Cary"
laying
his
hand
on
his
breast
"told
me
it
was
impossible
but
that
you
should
think
of
me.
Not
that
I
merit
thought;
but
we
are
old
acquaintance
we
are
cousins."
"I
came
again,
Robert;
mamma
and
I
came
again."
"Did
you?
Come,
that
is
worth
hearing.
Since
you
came
again,
we
will
sit
down
and
talk
about
it."
They
sat
down.
Caroline
drew
her
chair
up
to
his.
The
air
was
now
dark
with
snow;
an
Iceland
blast
was
driving
it
wildly.
This
pair
neither
heard
the
long
"wuthering"
rush,
nor
saw
the
white
burden
it
drifted.
Each
seemed
conscious
but
of
one
thing
the
presence
of
the
other.
"So
mamma
and
you
came
again?"
"And
Mrs.
Yorke
did
treat
us
strangely.
We
asked
to
see
you.
'No,'
said
she,
'not
in
my
house.
I
am
at
present
responsible
for
his
life;
it
shall
not
be
forfeited
for
half
an
hour's
idle
gossip.'
But
I
must
not
tell
you
all
she
said;
it
was
very
disagreeable.
However,
we
came
yet
again
mamma,
Miss
Keeldar,
and
I.
This
time
we
thought
we
should
conquer,
as
we
were
three
against
one,
and
Shirley
was
on
our
side.
But
Mrs.
Yorke
opened
such
a
battery."
Moore
smiled.
"What
did
she
say?"
"Things
that
astonished
us.
Shirley
laughed
at
last;
I
cried;
mamma
was
seriously
annoyed.
We
were
all
three
driven
from
the
field.
Since
that
time
I
have
only
walked
once
a
day
past
the
house,
just
for
the
satisfaction
of
looking
up
at
your
window,
which
I
could
distinguish
by
the
drawn
curtains.
I
really
dared
not
come
in."
"I
have
wished
for
you,
Caroline."
"I
did
not
know
that;
I
never
dreamt
one
instant
that
you
thought
of
me.
If
I
had
but
most
distantly
imagined
such
a
possibility
"
"Mrs.
Yorke
would
still
have
beaten
you."
"She
would
not.
Stratagem
should
have
been
tried,
if
persuasion
failed.
I
would
have
come
to
the
kitchen
door;
the
servants
should
have
let
me
in,
and
I
would
have
walked
straight
upstairs.
In
fact,
it
was
far
more
the
fear
of
intrusion
the
fear
of
yourself
that
baffled
me
than
the
fear
of
Mrs.
Yorke."
"Only
last
night
I
despaired
of
ever
seeing
you
again.
Weakness
has
wrought
terrible
depression
in
me
terrible
depression."
"And
you
sit
alone?"
"Worse
than
alone."
"But
you
must
be
getting
better,
since
you
can
leave
your
bed?"
"I
doubt
whether
I
shall
live.
I
see
nothing
for
it,
after
such
exhaustion,
but
decline."
"You
you
shall
go
home
to
the
Hollow."
"Dreariness
would
accompany,
nothing
cheerful
come
near
me."
"I
will
alter
this.
This
shall
be
altered,
were
there
ten
Mrs.
Yorkes
to
do
battle
with."
"Cary,
you
make
me
smile."
"Do
smile;
smile
again.
Shall
I
tell
you
what
I
should
like?"
"Tell
me
anything
only
keep
talking.
I
am
Saul;
but
for
music
I
should
perish."
"I
should
like
you
to
be
brought
to
the
rectory,
and
given
to
me
and
mamma."
"A
precious
gift!
I
have
not
laughed
since
they
shot
me
till
now."
"Do
you
suffer
pain,
Robert?"
"Not
so
much
pain
now;
but
I
am
hopelessly
weak,
and
the
state
of
my
mind
is
inexpressible
dark,
barren,
impotent.
Do
you
not
read
it
all
in
my
face?
I
look
a
mere
ghost."
"Altered;
yet
I
should
have
known
you
anywhere.
But
I
understand
your
feelings;
I
experienced
something
like
it.
Since
we
met,
I
too
have
been
very
ill."
"Very
ill?"
"I
thought
I
should
die.
The
tale
of
my
life
seemed
told.
Every
night,
just
at
midnight,
I
used
to
wake
from
awful
dreams;
and
the
book
lay
open
before
me
at
the
last
page,
where
was
written
'Finis.'
I
had
strange
feelings."
"You
speak
my
experience."
"I
believed
I
should
never
see
you
again;
and
I
grew
so
thin
as
thin
as
you
are
now.
I
could
do
nothing
for
myself
neither
rise
nor
lie
down;
and
I
could
not
eat.
Yet
you
see
I
am
better."
"Comforter
sad
as
sweet.
I
am
too
feeble
to
say
what
I
feel;
but
while
you
speak
I
do
feel."
"Here
I
am
at
your
side,
where
I
thought
never
more
to
be.
Here
I
speak
to
you.
I
see
you
listen
to
me
willingly
look
at
me
kindly.
Did
I
count
on
that?
I
despaired."
Moore
sighed
a
sigh
so
deep
it
was
nearly
a
groan.
He
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand.
"May
I
be
spared
to
make
some
atonement."
Such
was
his
prayer.
"And
for
what?"
"We
will
not
touch
on
it
now,
Cary;
unmanned
as
I
am,
I
have
not
the
power
to
cope
with
such
a
topic.
Was
Mrs.
Pryor
with
you
during
your
illness?"
"Yes"
Caroline
smiled
brightly
"you
know
she
is
mamma?"
"I
have
heard
Hortense
told
me;
but
that
tale
too
I
will
receive
from
yourself.
Does
she
add
to
your
happiness?"
"What!
mamma?
She
is
dear
to
me;
how
dear
I
cannot
say.
I
was
altogether
weary,
and
she
held
me
up."
"I
deserve
to
hear
that
in
a
moment
when
I
can
scarce
lift
my
hand
to
my
head.
I
deserve
it."
"It
is
no
reproach
against
you."
"It
is
a
coal
of
fire
heaped
on
my
head;
and
so
is
every
word
you
address
to
me,
and
every
look
that
lights
your
sweet
face.
Come
still
nearer,
Lina;
and
give
me
your
hand
if
my
thin
fingers
do
not
scare
you."
She
took
those
thin
fingers
between
her
two
little
hands;
she
bent
her
head
et
les
effleura
de
ses
levres.
(I
put
that
in
French
because
the
word
effleurer
is
an
exquisite
word.)
Moore
was
much
moved.
A
large
tear
or
two
coursed
down
his
hollow
cheek.
"I'll
keep
these
things
in
my
heart,
Cary;
that
kiss
I
will
put
by,
and
you
shall
hear
of
it
again
one
day."
"Come
out!"
cried
Martin,
opening
the
door
"come
away;
you
have
had
twenty
minutes
instead
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour."
"She
will
not
stir
yet,
you
hempseed."
"I
dare
not
stay
longer,
Robert."
"Can
you
promise
to
return?"
"No,
she
can't,"
responded
Martin.
"The
thing
mustn't
become
customary.
I
can't
be
troubled.
It's
very
well
for
once;
I'll
not
have
it
repeated."
"You'll
not
have
it
repeated."
"Hush!
don't
vex
him;
we
could
not
have
met
to
day
but
for
him.
But
I
will
come
again,
if
it
is
your
wish
that
I
should
come."
"It
is
my
wish
my
one
wish
almost
the
only
wish
I
can
feel."
"Come
this
minute.
My
mother
has
coughed,
got
up,
set
her
feet
on
the
floor.
Let
her
only
catch
you
on
the
stairs,
Miss
Caroline.
You're
not
to
bid
him
good
bye"
stepping
between
her
and
Moore
"you
are
to
march."
"My
shawl,
Martin."
"I
have
it.
I'll
put
it
on
for
you
when
you
are
in
the
hall."
He
made
them
part.
He
would
suffer
no
farewell
but
what
could
be
expressed
in
looks.
He
half
carried
Caroline
down
the
stairs.
In
the
hall
he
wrapped
her
shawl
round
her,
and,
but
that
his
mother's
tread
then
creaked
in
the
gallery,
and
but
that
a
sentiment
of
diffidence
the
proper,
natural,
therefore
the
noble
impulse
of
his
boy's
heart
held
him
back,
he
would
have
claimed
his
reward;
he
would
have
said,
"Now,
Miss
Caroline,
for
all
this
give
me
one
kiss."
But
ere
the
words
had
passed
his
lips
she
was
across
the
snowy
road,
rather
skimming
than
wading
the
drifts.
"She
is
my
debtor,
and
I
will
be
paid."
He
flattered
himself
that
it
was
opportunity,
not
audacity,
which
had
failed
him.
He
misjudged
the
quality
of
his
own
nature,
and
held
it
for
something
lower
than
it
was.
IN
THE
DISCHARGE
OF
RELIGIOUS
DUTIES.
Martin,
having
known
the
taste
of
excitement,
wanted
a
second
draught;
having
felt
the
dignity
of
power,
he
loathed
to
relinquish
it.
Miss
Helstone
that
girl
he
had
always
called
ugly,
and
whose
face
was
now
perpetually
before
his
eyes,
by
day
and
by
night,
in
dark
and
in
sunshine
had
once
come
within
his
sphere.
It
fretted
him
to
think
the
visit
might
never
be
repeated.
Though
a
schoolboy
he
was
no
ordinary
schoolboy;
he
was
destined
to
grow
up
an
original.
At
a
few
years'
later
date
he
took
great
pains
to
pare
and
polish
himself
down
to
the
pattern
of
the
rest
of
the
world,
but
he
never
succeeded;
an
unique
stamp
marked
him
always.
He
now
sat
idle
at
his
desk
in
the
grammar
school,
casting
about
in
his
mind
for
the
means
of
adding
another
chapter
to
his
commenced
romance.
He
did
not
yet
know
how
many
commenced
life
romances
are
doomed
never
to
get
beyond
the
first,
or
at
most
the
second
chapter.
His
Saturday
half
holiday
he
spent
in
the
wood
with
his
book
of
fairy
legends,
and
that
other
unwritten
book
of
his
imagination.
Martin
harboured
an
irreligious
reluctance
to
see
the
approach
of
Sunday.
His
father
and
mother,
while
disclaiming
community
with
the
Establishment,
failed
not
duly,
once
on
the
sacred
day,
to
fill
their
large
pew
in
Briarfield
Church
with
the
whole
of
their
blooming
family.
Theoretically,
Mr.
Yorke
placed
all
sects
and
churches
on
a
level.
Mrs.
Yorke
awarded
the
palm
to
Moravians
and
Quakers,
on
account
of
that
crown
of
humility
by
these
worthies
worn.
Neither
of
them
were
ever
known,
however,
to
set
foot
in
a
conventicle.
Martin,
I
say,
disliked
Sunday,
because
the
morning
service
was
long,
and
the
sermon
usually
little
to
his
taste.
This
Saturday
afternoon,
however,
his
woodland
musings
disclosed
to
him
a
new
found
charm
in
the
coming
day.
It
proved
a
day
of
deep
snow
so
deep
that
Mrs.
Yorke
during
breakfast
announced
her
conviction
that
the
children,
both
boys
and
girls,
would
be
better
at
home;
and
her
decision
that,
instead
of
going
to
church,
they
should
sit
silent
for
two
hours
in
the
back
parlour,
while
Rose
and
Martin
alternately
read
a
succession
of
sermons
John
Wesley's
"Sermons."
John
Wesley,
being
a
reformer
and
an
agitator,
had
a
place
both
in
her
own
and
her
husband's
favour.
"Rose
will
do
as
she
pleases,"
said
Martin,
not
looking
up
from
the
book
which,
according
to
his
custom
then
and
in
after
life,
he
was
studying
over
his
bread
and
milk.
"Rose
will
do
as
she
is
told,
and
Martin
too,"
observed
the
mother.
"I
am
going
to
church."
So
her
son
replied,
with
the
ineffable
quietude
of
a
true
Yorke,
who
knows
his
will
and
means
to
have
it,
and
who,
if
pushed
to
the
wall,
will
let
himself
be
crushed
to
death,
provided
no
way
of
escape
can
be
found,
but
will
never
capitulate.
"It
is
not
fit
weather,"
said
the
father.
No
answer.
The
youth
read
studiously;
he
slowly
broke
his
bread
and
sipped
his
milk.
"Martin
hates
to
go
to
church,
but
he
hates
still
more
to
obey,"
said
Mrs.
Yorke.
"I
suppose
I
am
influenced
by
pure
perverseness?"
"Yes,
you
are."
"Mother,
I
am
not."
"By
what,
then,
are
you
influenced?"
"By
a
complication
of
motives,
the
intricacies
of
which
I
should
as
soon
think
of
explaining
to
you
as
I
should
of
turning
myself
inside
out
to
exhibit
the
internal
machinery
of
my
frame."
"Hear
Martin!
hear
him!"
cried
Mr.
Yorke.
"I
must
see
and
have
this
lad
of
mine
brought
up
to
the
bar.
Nature
meant
him
to
live
by
his
tongue.
Hesther,
your
third
son
must
certainly
be
a
lawyer;
he
has
the
stock
in
trade
brass,
self
conceit,
and
words
words
words."
"Some
bread,
Rose,
if
you
please,"
requested
Martin,
with
intense
gravity,
serenity,
phlegm.
The
boy
had
naturally
a
low,
plaintive
voice,
which
in
his
"dour
moods"
rose
scarcely
above
a
lady's
whisper.
The
more
inflexibly
stubborn
the
humour,
the
softer,
the
sadder
the
tone.
He
rang
the
bell,
and
gently
asked
for
his
walking
shoes.
"But,
Martin,"
urged
his
sire,
"there
is
drift
all
the
way;
a
man
could
hardly
wade
through
it.
However,
lad,"
he
continued,
seeing
that
the
boy
rose
as
the
church
bell
began
to
toll,
"this
is
a
case
wherein
I
would
by
no
means
balk
the
obdurate
chap
of
his
will.
Go
to
church
by
all
means.
There
is
a
pitiless
wind,
and
a
sharp,
frozen
sleet,
besides
the
depth
under
foot.
Go
out
into
it,
since
thou
prefers
it
to
a
warm
fireside."
Martin
quietly
assumed
his
cloak,
comforter,
and
cap,
and
deliberately
went
out.
"My
father
has
more
sense
than
my
mother,"
he
pronounced.
"How
women
miss
it!
They
drive
the
nail
into
the
flesh,
thinking
they
are
hammering
away
at
insensate
stone."
He
reached
church
early.
"Now,
if
the
weather
frightens
her
(and
it
is
a
real
December
tempest),
or
if
that
Mrs.
Pryor
objects
to
her
going
out,
and
I
should
miss
her
after
all,
it
will
vex
me;
but,
tempest
or
tornado,
hail
or
ice,
she
ought
to
come,
and
if
she
has
a
mind
worthy
of
her
eyes
and
features
she
will
come.
She
will
be
here
for
the
chance
of
seeing
me,
as
I
am
here
for
the
chance
of
seeing
her.
She
will
want
to
get
a
word
respecting
her
confounded
sweetheart,
as
I
want
to
get
another
flavour
of
what
I
think
the
essence
of
life
a
taste
of
existence,
with
the
spirit
preserved
in
it,
and
not
evaporated.
Adventure
is
to
stagnation
what
champagne
is
to
flat
porter."
He
looked
round.
The
church
was
cold,
silent,
empty,
but
for
one
old
woman.
As
the
chimes
subsided
and
the
single
bell
tolled
slowly,
another
and
another
elderly
parishioner
came
dropping
in,
and
took
a
humble
station
in
the
free
sittings.
It
is
always
the
frailest,
the
oldest,
and
the
poorest
that
brave
the
worst
weather,
to
prove
and
maintain
their
constancy
to
dear
old
mother
church.
This
wild
morning
not
one
affluent
family
attended,
not
one
carriage
party
appeared
all
the
lined
and
cushioned
pews
were
empty;
only
on
the
bare
oaken
seats
sat
ranged
the
gray
haired
elders
and
feeble
paupers.
"I'll
scorn
her
if
she
doesn't
come,"
muttered
Martin,
shortly
and
savagely,
to
himself.
The
rector's
shovel
hat
had
passed
the
porch.
Mr.
Helstone
and
his
clerk
were
in
the
vestry.
The
bells
ceased
the
reading
desk
was
filled
the
doors
were
closed
the
service
commenced.
Void
stood
the
rectory
pew
she
was
not
there.
Martin
scorned
her.
"Worthless
thing!
vapid
thing!
commonplace
humbug!
Like
all
other
girls
weakly,
selfish,
shallow!"
Such
was
Martin's
liturgy.
"She
is
not
like
our
picture.
Her
eyes
are
not
large
and
expressive;
her
nose
is
not
straight,
delicate,
Hellenic;
her
mouth
has
not
that
charm
I
thought
it
had,
which
I
imagined
could
beguile
me
of
sullenness
in
my
worst
moods.
What
is
she?
A
thread
paper,
a
doll,
a
toy,
a
girl,
in
short."
So
absorbed
was
the
young
cynic
he
forgot
to
rise
from
his
knees
at
the
proper
place,
and
was
still
in
an
exemplary
attitude
of
devotion
when,
the
litany
over,
the
first
hymn
was
given
out.
To
be
so
caught
did
not
contribute
to
soothe
him.
He
started
up
red
(for
he
was
as
sensitive
to
ridicule
as
any
girl).
To
make
the
matter
worse,
the
church
door
had
reopened,
and
the
aisles
were
filling:
patter,
patter,
patter,
a
hundred
little
feet
trotted
in.
It
was
the
Sunday
scholars.
According
to
Briarfield
winter
custom,
these
children
had
till
now
been
kept
where
there
was
a
warm
stove,
and
only
led
into
church
just
before
the
communion
and
sermon.
The
little
ones
were
settled
first,
and
at
last,
when
the
boys
and
the
younger
girls
were
all
arranged
when
the
organ
was
swelling
high,
and
the
choir
and
congregation
were
rising
to
uplift
a
spiritual
song
a
tall
class
of
young
women
came
quietly
in,
closing
the
procession.
Their
teacher,
having
seen
them
seated,
passed
into
the
rectory
pew.
The
French
gray
cloak
and
small
beaver
bonnet
were
known
to
Martin;
it
was
the
very
costume
his
eyes
had
ached
to
catch.
Miss
Helstone
had
not
suffered
the
storm
to
prove
an
impediment.
After
all,
she
was
come
to
church.
Martin
probably
whispered
his
satisfaction
to
his
hymn
book;
at
any
rate,
he
therewith
hid
his
face
two
minutes.
Satisfied
or
not,
he
had
time
to
get
very
angry
with
her
again
before
the
sermon
was
over.
She
had
never
once
looked
his
way;
at
least
he
had
not
been
so
lucky
as
to
encounter
a
glance.
"If,"
he
said
"if
she
takes
no
notice
of
me,
if
she
shows
I
am
not
in
her
thoughts,
I
shall
have
a
worse,
a
meaner
opinion
of
her
than
ever.
Most
despicable
would
it
be
to
come
for
the
sake
of
those
sheep
faced
Sunday
scholars,
and
not
for
my
sake
or
that
long
skeleton
Moore's."
The
sermon
found
an
end;
the
benediction
was
pronounced;
the
congregation
dispersed.
She
had
not
been
near
him.
Now,
indeed,
as
Martin
set
his
face
homeward,
he
felt
that
the
sleet
was
sharp
and
the
east
wind
cold.
His
nearest
way
lay
through
some
fields.
It
was
a
dangerous,
because
an
untrodden
way.
He
did
not
care;
he
would
take
it.
Near
the
second
stile
rose
a
clump
of
trees.
Was
that
an
umbrella
waiting
there?
Yes,
an
umbrella,
held
with
evident
difficulty
against
the
blast;
behind
it
fluttered
a
French
gray
cloak.
Martin
grinned
as
he
toiled
up
the
steep,
encumbered
field,
difficult
to
the
foot
as
a
slope
in
the
upper
realms
of
Etna.
There
was
an
inimitable
look
in
his
face
when,
having
gained
the
stile,
he
seated
himself
coolly
thereupon,
and
thus
opened
a
conference
which,
for
his
own
part,
he
was
willing
to
prolong
indefinitely.
"I
think
you
had
better
strike
a
bargain.
Exchange
me
for
Mrs.
Pryor."
"I
was
not
sure
whether
you
would
come
this
way,
Martin,
but
I
thought
I
would
run
the
chance.
There
is
no
such
thing
as
getting
a
quiet
word
spoken
in
the
church
or
churchyard."
"Will
you
agree?
make
over
Mrs.
Pryor
to
my
mother,
and
put
me
in
her
skirts?"
"As
if
I
could
understand
you!
What
puts
Mrs.
Pryor
into
your
head?"
"You
call
her
'mamma,'
don't
you?"
"She
is
my
mamma."
"Not
possible
or
so
inefficient,
so
careless
a
mamma;
I
should
make
a
five
times
better
one.
You
may
laugh.
I
have
no
objection
to
see
you
laugh.
Your
teeth
I
hate
ugly
teeth;
but
yours
are
as
pretty
as
a
pearl
necklace,
and
a
necklace
of
which
the
pearls
are
very
fair,
even,
and
well
matched
too."
"Martin,
what
now?
I
thought
the
Yorkes
never
paid
compliments?"
"They
have
not
done
till
this
generation;
but
I
feel
as
if
it
were
my
vocation
to
turn
out
a
new
variety
of
the
Yorke
species.
I
am
rather
tired
of
my
own
ancestors.
We
have
traditions
going
back
for
four
ages
tales
of
Hiram,
which
was
the
son
of
Hiram,
which
was
the
son
of
Samuel,
which
was
the
son
of
John,
which
was
the
son
of
Zerubbabel
Yorke.
All,
from
Zerubbabel
down
to
the
last
Hiram,
were
such
as
you
see
my
father.
Before
that
there
was
a
Godfrey.
We
have
his
picture;
it
hangs
in
Moore's
bedroom;
it
is
like
me.
Of
his
character
we
know
nothing;
but
I
am
sure
it
was
different
to
his
descendants.
He
has
long,
curling
dark
hair;
he
is
carefully
and
cavalierly
dressed.
Having
said
that
he
is
like
me,
I
need
not
add
that
he
is
handsome."
"You
are
not
handsome,
Martin."
"No;
but
wait
awhile
just
let
me
take
my
time.
I
mean
to
begin
from
this
day
to
cultivate,
to
polish,
and
we
shall
see."
"You
are
a
very
strange,
a
very
unaccountable
boy,
Martin.
But
don't
imagine
you
ever
will
be
handsome;
you
cannot."
"I
mean
to
try.
But
we
were
talking
about
Mrs.
Pryor.
She
must
be
the
most
unnatural
mamma
in
existence,
coolly
to
let
her
daughter
come
out
in
this
weather.
Mine
was
in
such
a
rage
because
I
would
go
to
church;
she
was
fit
to
fling
the
kitchen
brush
after
me."
"Mamma
was
very
much
concerned
about
me;
but
I
am
afraid
I
was
obstinate.
I
would
go."
"To
see
me?"
"Exactly;
I
thought
of
nothing
else.
I
greatly
feared
the
snow
would
hinder
you
from
coming.
You
don't
know
how
pleased
I
was
to
see
you
all
by
yourself
in
the
pew."
"I
came
to
fulfil
my
duty,
and
set
the
parish
a
good
example.
And
so
you
were
obstinate,
were
you?
I
should
like
to
see
you
obstinate,
I
should.
Wouldn't
I
have
you
in
good
discipline
if
I
owned
you?
Let
me
take
the
umbrella."
"I
can't
stay
two
minutes;
our
dinner
will
be
ready."
"And
so
will
ours;
and
we
have
always
a
hot
dinner
on
Sundays.
Roast
goose
to
day,
with
apple
pie
and
rice
pudding.
I
always
contrive
to
know
the
bill
of
fare.
Well,
I
like
these
things
uncommonly;
but
I'll
make
the
sacrifice,
if
you
will."
"We
have
a
cold
dinner.
My
uncle
will
allow
no
unnecessary
cooking
on
the
Sabbath.
But
I
must
return;
the
house
would
be
in
commotion
if
I
failed
to
appear."
"So
will
Briarmains,
bless
you!
I
think
I
hear
my
father
sending
out
the
overlooker
and
five
of
the
dyers,
to
look
in
six
directions
for
the
body
of
his
prodigal
son
in
the
snow;
and
my
mother
repenting
her
of
her
many
misdeeds
towards
me,
now
I
am
gone."
"Martin,
how
is
Mr.
Moore?"
"That
is
what
you
came
for,
just
to
say
that
word."
"Come,
tell
me
quickly."
"Hang
him!
he
is
no
worse;
but
as
ill
used
as
ever
mewed
up,
kept
in
solitary
confinement.
They
mean
to
make
either
an
idiot
or
a
maniac
of
him,
and
take
out
a
commission
of
lunacy.
Horsfall
starves
him;
you
saw
how
thin
he
was."
"You
were
very
good
the
other
day,
Martin."
"What
day?
I
am
always
good
a
model."
"When
will
you
be
so
good
again?"
"I
see
what
you
are
after;
but
you'll
not
wheedle
me
I
am
no
cat's
paw."
"But
it
must
be
done.
It
is
quite
a
right
thing,
and
a
necessary
thing."
"How
you
encroach!
Remember,
I
managed
the
matter
of
my
own
free
will
before."
"And
you
will
again."
"I
won't.
The
business
gave
me
far
too
much
trouble.
I
like
my
ease."
"Mr.
Moore
wishes
to
see
me,
Martin,
and
I
wish
to
see
him."
"I
dare
say"
(coolly).
"It
is
too
bad
of
your
mother
to
exclude
his
friends."
"Tell
her
so."
"His
own
relations."
"Come
and
blow
her
up."
"You
know
that
would
advance
nothing.
Well,
I
shall
stick
to
my
point.
See
him
I
will.
If
you
won't
help
me,
I'll
manage
without
help."
"Do;
there
is
nothing
like
self
reliance,
self
dependence."
"I
have
no
time
to
reason
with
you
now;
but
I
consider
you
provoking.
Good
morning."
Away
she
went,
the
umbrella
shut,
for
she
could
not
carry
it
against
the
wind.
"She
is
not
vapid;
she
is
not
shallow,"
said
Martin.
"I
shall
like
to
watch,
and
mark
how
she
will
work
her
way
without
help.
If
the
storm
were
not
of
snow,
but
of
fire
such
as
came
refreshingly
down
on
the
cities
of
the
plain
she
would
go
through
it
to
procure
five
minutes'
speech
of
that
Moore.
Now,
I
consider
I
have
had
a
pleasant
morning.
The
disappointments
got
time
on;
the
fears
and
fits
of
anger
only
made
that
short
discourse
pleasanter,
when
it
came
at
last.
She
expected
to
coax
me
at
once.
She'll
not
manage
that
in
one
effort.
She
shall
come
again,
again,
and
yet
again.
It
would
please
me
to
put
her
in
a
passion
to
make
her
cry.
I
want
to
discover
how
far
she
will
go
what
she
will
do
and
dare
to
get
her
will.
It
seems
strange
and
new
to
find
one
human
being
thinking
so
much
about
another
as
she
thinks
about
Moore.
But
it
is
time
to
go
home;
my
appetite
tells
me
the
hour.
Won't
I
walk
into
that
goose?
and
we'll
try
whether
Matthew
or
I
shall
get
the
largest
cut
of
the
apple
pie
to
day."
Martin
had
planned
well.
He
had
laid
out
a
dexterously
concerted
scheme
for
his
private
amusement.
But
older
and
wiser
schemers
than
he
are
often
doomed
to
see
their
finest
spun
projects
swept
to
annihilation
by
the
sudden
broom
of
Fate,
that
fell
housewife
whose
red
arm
none
can
control.
In
the
present
instance
this
broom
was
manufactured
out
of
the
tough
fibres
of
Moore's
own
stubborn
purpose,
bound
tight
with
his
will.
He
was
now
resuming
his
strength,
and
making
strange
head
against
Mrs.
Horsfall.
Each
morning
he
amazed
that
matron
with
a
fresh
astonishment.
First
he
discharged
her
from
her
valet
duties;
he
would
dress
himself.
Then
he
refused
the
coffee
she
brought
him;
he
would
breakfast
with
the
family.
Lastly,
he
forbade
her
his
chamber.
On
the
same
day,
amidst
the
outcries
of
all
the
women
in
the
place,
he
put
his
head
out
of
doors.
The
morning
after,
he
followed
Mr.
Yorke
to
his
counting
house,
and
requested
an
envoy
to
fetch
a
chaise
from
the
Red
House
Inn.
He
was
resolved,
he
said,
to
return
home
to
the
Hollow
that
very
afternoon.
Mr.
Yorke,
instead
of
opposing,
aided
and
abetted
him.
The
chaise
was
sent
for,
though
Mrs.
Yorke
declared
the
step
would
be
his
death.
It
came.
Moore,
little
disposed
to
speak,
made
his
purse
do
duty
for
his
tongue.
He
expressed
his
gratitude
to
the
servants
and
to
Mrs.
Horsfall
by
the
chink
of
his
coin.
The
latter
personage
approved
and
understood
this
language
perfectly;
it
made
amends
for
all
previous
contumacy.
She
and
her
patient
parted
the
best
friends
in
the
world.
The
kitchen
visited
and
soothed,
Moore
betook
himself
to
the
parlour.
He
had
Mrs.
Yorke
to
appease;
not
quite
so
easy
a
task
as
the
pacification
of
her
housemaids.
There
she
sat
plunged
in
sullen
dudgeon,
the
gloomiest
speculations
on
the
depths
of
man's
ingratitude
absorbing
her
thoughts.
He
drew
near
and
bent
over
her;
she
was
obliged
to
look
up,
if
it
were
only
to
bid
him
"avaunt."
There
was
beauty
still
in
his
pale,
wasted
features;
there
was
earnestness
and
a
sort
of
sweetness
for
he
was
smiling
in
his
hollow
eyes.
"Good
bye!"
he
said,
and
as
he
spoke
the
smile
glittered
and
melted.
He
had
no
iron
mastery
of
his
sensations
now;
a
trifling
emotion
made
itself
apparent
in
his
present
weak
state.
"And
what
are
you
going
to
leave
us
for?"
she
asked.
"We
will
keep
you,
and
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you,
if
you
will
only
stay
till
you
are
stronger."
"Good
bye!"
he
again
said;
and
added,
"You
have
been
a
mother
to
me;
give
your
wilful
son
one
embrace."
Like
a
foreigner,
as
he
was,
he
offered
her
first
one
cheek,
then
the
other.
She
kissed
him.
"What
a
trouble
what
a
burden
I
have
been
to
you!"
he
muttered.
"You
are
the
worst
trouble
now,
headstrong
youth!"
was
the
answer.
"I
wonder
who
is
to
nurse
you
at
Hollow's
Cottage?
Your
sister
Hortense
knows
no
more
about
such
matters
than
a
child."
"Thank
God!
for
I
have
had
nursing
enough
to
last
me
my
life."
Here
the
little
girls
came
in
Jessie
crying,
Rose
quiet
but
grave.
Moore
took
them
out
into
the
hall
to
soothe,
pet,
and
kiss
them.
He
knew
it
was
not
in
their
mother's
nature
to
bear
to
see
any
living
thing
caressed
but
herself.
She
would
have
felt
annoyed
had
he
fondled
a
kitten
in
her
presence.
The
boys
were
standing
about
the
chaise
as
Moore
entered
it;
but
for
them
he
had
no
farewell.
To
Mr.
Yorke
he
only
said,
"You
have
a
good
riddance
of
me.
That
was
an
unlucky
shot
for
you,
Yorke;
it
turned
Briarmains
into
an
hospital.
Come
and
see
me
at
the
cottage
soon."
He
drew
up
the
glass;
the
chaise
rolled
away.
In
half
an
hour
he
alighted
at
his
own
garden
wicket.
Having
paid
the
driver
and
dismissed
the
vehicle,
he
leaned
on
that
wicket
an
instant,
at
once
to
rest
and
to
muse.
"Six
months
ago
I
passed
out
at
this
gate,"
said
he,
"a
proud,
angry,
disappointed
man.
I
come
back
sadder
and
wiser;
weakly
enough,
but
not
worried.
A
cold,
gray,
yet
quiet
world
lies
round
a
world
where,
if
I
hope
little,
I
fear
nothing.
All
slavish
terrors
of
embarrassment
have
left
me.
Let
the
worst
come,
I
can
work,
as
Joe
Scott
does,
for
an
honourable
living;
in
such
doom
I
yet
see
some
hardship
but
no
degradation.
Formerly,
pecuniary
ruin
was
equivalent
in
my
eyes
to
personal
dishonour.
It
is
not
so
now;
I
know
the
difference.
Ruin
is
an
evil,
but
one
for
which
I
am
prepared;
the
day
of
whose
coming
I
know,
for
I
have
calculated.
I
can
yet
put
it
off
six
months
not
an
hour
longer.
If
things
by
that
time
alter,
which
is
not
probable;
if
fetters,
which
now
seem
indissoluble,
should
be
loosened
from
our
trade
(of
all
things
the
most
unlikely
to
happen),
I
might
conquer
in
this
long
struggle
yet
I
might
good
God!
what
might
I
not
do?
But
the
thought
is
a
brief
madness;
let
me
see
things
with
sane
eyes.
Ruin
will
come,
lay
her
axe
to
my
fortune's
roots,
and
hew
them
down.
I
shall
snatch
a
sapling,
I
shall
cross
the
sea,
and
plant
it
in
American
woods.
Louis
will
go
with
me.
Will
none
but
Louis
go?
I
cannot
tell
I
have
no
right
to
ask."
He
entered
the
house.
It
was
afternoon,
twilight
yet
out
of
doors
starless
and
moonless
twilight;
for
though
keenly
freezing
with
a
dry,
black
frost,
heaven
wore
a
mask
of
clouds
congealed
and
fast
locked.
The
mill
dam
too
was
frozen.
The
Hollow
was
very
still.
Indoors
it
was
already
dark.
Sarah
had
lit
a
good
fire
in
the
parlour;
she
was
preparing
tea
in
the
kitchen.
"Hortense,"
said
Moore,
as
his
sister
bustled
up
to
help
him
off
with
his
cloak,
"I
am
pleased
to
come
home."
Hortense
did
not
feel
the
peculiar
novelty
of
this
expression
coming
from
her
brother,
who
had
never
before
called
the
cottage
his
home,
and
to
whom
its
narrow
limits
had
always
heretofore
seemed
rather
restrictive
than
protective.
Still,
whatever
contributed
to
his
happiness
pleased
her,
and
she
expressed
herself
to
that
effect.
He
sat
down,
but
soon
rose
again.
He
went
to
the
window;
he
came
back
to
the
fire.
"Hortense!"
"Mon
frere?"
"This
little
parlour
looks
very
clean
and
pleasant
unusually
bright,
somehow."
"It
is
true,
brother;
I
have
had
the
whole
house
thoroughly
and
scrupulously
cleaned
in
your
absence."
"Sister,
I
think
on
this
first
day
of
your
return
home
you
ought
to
have
a
friend
or
so
to
tea,
if
it
were
only
to
see
how
fresh
and
spruce
you
have
made
the
little
place."
"True,
brother.
If
it
were
not
late
I
might
send
for
Miss
Mann."
"So
you
might;
but
it
really
is
too
late
to
disturb
that
good
lady,
and
the
evening
is
much
too
cold
for
her
to
come
out."
"How
thoughtful
in
you,
dear
Gerard!
We
must
put
it
off
till
another
day."
"I
want
some
one
to
day,
dear
sister
some
quiet
guest,
who
would
tire
neither
of
us."
"Miss
Ainley?"
"An
excellent
person,
they
say;
but
she
lives
too
far
off.
Tell
Harry
Scott
to
step
up
to
the
rectory
with
a
request
from
you
that
Caroline
Helstone
should
come
and
spend
the
evening
with
you."
"Would
it
not
be
better
to
morrow,
dear
brother?"
"I
should
like
her
to
see
the
place
as
it
is
just
now;
its
brilliant
cleanliness
and
perfect
neatness
are
so
much
to
your
credit."
"It
might
benefit
her
in
the
way
of
example."
"It
might
and
must;
she
ought
to
come."
He
went
into
the
kitchen.
"Sarah,
delay
tea
half
an
hour."
He
then
commissioned
her
to
dispatch
Harry
Scott
to
the
rectory,
giving
her
a
twisted
note
hastily
scribbled
in
pencil
by
himself,
and
addressed
"Miss
Helstone."
Scarcely
had
Sarah
time
to
get
impatient
under
the
fear
of
damage
to
her
toast
already
prepared
when
the
messenger
returned,
and
with
him
the
invited
guest.
She
entered
through
the
kitchen,
quietly
tripped
up
Sarah's
stairs
to
take
off
her
bonnet
and
furs,
and
came
down
as
quietly,
with
her
beautiful
curls
nicely
smoothed,
her
graceful
merino
dress
and
delicate
collar
all
trim
and
spotless,
her
gay
little
work
bag
in
her
hand.
She
lingered
to
exchange
a
few
kindly
words
with
Sarah,
and
to
look
at
the
new
tortoise
shell
kitten
basking
on
the
kitchen
hearth,
and
to
speak
to
the
canary
bird,
which
a
sudden
blaze
from
the
fire
had
startled
on
its
perch;
and
then
she
betook
herself
to
the
parlour.
The
gentle
salutation,
the
friendly
welcome,
were
interchanged
in
such
tranquil
sort
as
befitted
cousins
meeting;
a
sense
of
pleasure,
subtle
and
quiet
as
a
perfume,
diffused
itself
through
the
room;
the
newly
kindled
lamp
burnt
up
bright;
the
tray
and
the
singing
urn
were
brought
in.
"I
am
pleased
to
come
home,"
repeated
Mr.
Moore.
They
assembled
round
the
table.
Hortense
chiefly
talked.
She
congratulated
Caroline
on
the
evident
improvement
in
her
health.
Her
colour
and
her
plump
cheeks
were
returning,
she
remarked.
It
was
true.
There
was
an
obvious
change
in
Miss
Helstone.
All
about
her
seemed
elastic;
depression,
fear,
forlornness,
were
withdrawn.
No
longer
crushed,
and
saddened,
and
slow,
and
drooping,
she
looked
like
one
who
had
tasted
the
cordial
of
heart's
ease,
and
been
lifted
on
the
wing
of
hope.
After
tea
Hortense
went
upstairs.
She
had
not
rummaged
her
drawers
for
a
month
past,
and
the
impulse
to
perform
that
operation
was
now
become
resistless.
During
her
absence
the
talk
passed
into
Caroline's
hands.
She
took
it
up
with
ease;
she
fell
into
her
best
tone
of
conversation.
A
pleasing
facility
and
elegance
of
language
gave
fresh
charm
to
familiar
topics;
a
new
music
in
the
always
soft
voice
gently
surprised
and
pleasingly
captivated
the
listener;
unwonted
shades
and
lights
of
expression
elevated
the
young
countenance
with
character,
and
kindled
it
with
animation.
"Caroline,
you
look
as
if
you
had
heard
good
tidings,"
said
Moore,
after
earnestly
gazing
at
her
for
some
minutes.
"Do
I?"
"I
sent
for
you
this
evening
that
I
might
be
cheered;
but
you
cheer
me
more
than
I
had
calculated."
"I
am
glad
of
that.
And
I
really
cheer
you?"
"You
look
brightly,
move
buoyantly,
speak
musically."
"It
is
pleasant
to
be
here
again."
"Truly
it
is
pleasant;
I
feel
it
so.
And
to
see
health
on
your
cheek
and
hope
in
your
eye
is
pleasant,
Cary;
but
what
is
this
hope,
and
what
is
the
source
of
this
sunshine
I
perceive
about
you?"
"For
one
thing,
I
am
happy
in
mamma.
I
love
her
so
much,
and
she
loves
me.
Long
and
tenderly
she
nursed
me.
Now,
when
her
care
has
made
me
well,
I
can
occupy
myself
for
and
with
her
all
the
day.
I
say
it
is
my
turn
to
attend
to
her;
and
I
do
attend
to
her.
I
am
her
waiting
woman
as
well
as
her
child.
I
like
you
would
laugh
if
you
knew
what
pleasure
I
have
in
making
dresses
and
sewing
for
her.
She
looks
so
nice
now,
Robert;
I
will
not
let
her
be
old
fashioned.
And
then,
she
is
charming
to
talk
to
full
of
wisdom,
ripe
in
judgment,
rich
in
information,
exhaustless
in
stores
her
observant
faculties
have
quietly
amassed.
Every
day
that
I
live
with
her
I
like
her
better,
I
esteem
her
more
highly,
I
love
her
more
tenderly."
"That
for
one
thing,
then,
Cary.
You
talk
in
such
a
way
about
'mamma'
it
is
enough
to
make
one
jealous
of
the
old
lady."
"She
is
not
old,
Robert."
"Of
the
young
lady,
then."
"She
does
not
pretend
to
be
young."
"Well,
of
the
matron.
But
you
said
'mamma's'
affection
was
one
thing
that
made
you
happy;
now
for
the
other
thing."
"I
am
glad
you
are
better."
"What
besides?"
"I
am
glad
we
are
friends."
"You
and
I?"
"Yes.
I
once
thought
we
never
should
be."
"Cary,
some
day
I
mean
to
tell
you
a
thing
about
myself
that
is
not
to
my
credit,
and
consequently
will
not
please
you."
"Ah,
don't!
I
cannot
bear
to
think
ill
of
you."
"And
I
cannot
bear
that
you
should
think
better
of
me
than
I
deserve."
"Well,
but
I
half
know
your
'thing;'
indeed,
I
believe
I
know
all
about
it."
"You
do
not."
"I
believe
I
do."
"Whom
does
it
concern
besides
me?"
She
coloured;
she
hesitated;
she
was
silent.
"Speak,
Cary!
Whom
does
it
concern?"
She
tried
to
utter
a
name,
and
could
not.
"Tell
me;
there
is
none
present
but
ourselves.
Be
frank."
"But
if
I
guess
wrong?"
"I
will
forgive.
Whisper,
Cary."
He
bent
his
ear
to
her
lips.
Still
she
would
not,
or
could
not,
speak
clearly
to
the
point.
Seeing
that
Moore
waited
and
was
resolved
to
hear
something,
she
at
last
said,
"Miss
Keeldar
spent
a
day
at
the
rectory
about
a
week
since.
The
evening
came
on
very
wintry,
and
we
persuaded
her
to
stay
all
night."
"And
you
and
she
curled
your
hair
together?"
"How
do
you
know
that?"
"And
then
you
chattered,
and
she
told
you
"
"It
was
not
at
curling
hair
time,
so
you
are
not
as
wise
as
you
think;
and,
besides,
she
didn't
tell
me."
"You
slept
together
afterwards?"
"We
occupied
the
same
room
and
bed.
We
did
not
sleep
much;
we
talked
the
whole
night
through."
"I'll
be
sworn
you
did!
And
then
it
all
came
out
tant
pis.
I
would
rather
you
had
heard
it
from
myself."
"You
are
quite
wrong.
She
did
not
tell
me
what
you
suspect
she
is
not
the
person
to
proclaim
such
things;
but
yet
I
inferred
something
from
parts
of
her
discourse.
I
gathered
more
from
rumour,
and
I
made
out
the
rest
by
instinct."
"But
if
she
did
not
tell
you
that
I
wanted
to
marry
her
for
the
sake
of
her
money,
and
that
she
refused
me
indignantly
and
scornfully
(you
need
neither
start
nor
blush;
nor
yet
need
you
prick
your
trembling
fingers
with
your
needle.
That
is
the
plain
truth,
whether
you
like
it
or
not)
if
such
was
not
the
subject
of
her
august
confidences,
on
what
point
did
they
turn?
You
say
you
talked
the
whole
night
through;
what
about?"
"About
things
we
never
thoroughly
discussed
before,
intimate
friends
as
we
have
been;
but
you
hardly
expect
I
should
tell
you?"
"Yes,
yes,
Cary;
you
will
tell
me.
You
said
we
were
friends,
and
friends
should
always
confide
in
each
other."
"But
you
are
sure
you
won't
repeat
it?"
"Quite
sure."
"Not
to
Louis?"
"Not
even
to
Louis.
What
does
Louis
care
for
young
ladies'
secrets?"
"Robert,
Shirley
is
a
curious,
magnanimous
being."
"I
dare
say.
I
can
imagine
there
are
both
odd
points
and
grand
points
about
her."
"I
have
found
her
chary
in
showing
her
feelings;
but
when
they
rush
out,
river
like,
and
pass
full
and
powerful
before
you
almost
without
leave
from
her
you
gaze,
wonder;
you
admire,
and
I
think
love
her."
"You
saw
this
spectacle?"
"Yes;
at
dead
of
night,
when
all
the
house
was
silent,
and
starlight
and
the
cold
reflection
from
the
snow
glimmered
in
our
chamber,
then
I
saw
Shirley's
heart."
"Her
heart's
core?
Do
you
think
she
showed
you
that?"
"Her
heart's
core."
"And
how
was
it?"
"Like
a
shrine,
for
it
was
holy;
like
snow,
for
it
was
pure;
like
flame,
for
it
was
warm;
like
death,
for
it
was
strong."
"Can
she
love?
tell
me
that."
"What
think
you?"
"She
has
loved
none
that
have
loved
her
yet."
"Who
are
those
that
have
loved
her?"
He
named
a
list
of
gentlemen,
closing
with
Sir
Philip
Nunnely.
"She
has
loved
none
of
these."
"Yet
some
of
them
were
worthy
of
a
woman's
affection."
"Of
some
women's,
but
not
of
Shirley's."
"Is
she
better
than
others
of
her
sex?"
"She
is
peculiar,
and
more
dangerous
to
take
as
a
wife
rashly."
"I
can
imagine
that."
"She
spoke
of
you
"
"Oh,
she
did!
I
thought
you
denied
it."
"She
did
not
speak
in
the
way
you
fancy;
but
I
asked
her,
and
I
would
make
her
tell
me
what
she
thought
of
you,
or
rather
how
she
felt
towards
you.
I
wanted
to
know;
I
had
long
wanted
to
know."
"So
had
I;
but
let
us
hear.
She
thinks
meanly,
she
feels
contemptuously,
doubtless?"
"She
thinks
of
you
almost
as
highly
as
a
woman
can
think
of
a
man.
You
know
she
can
be
eloquent.
I
yet
feel
in
fancy
the
glow
of
the
language
in
which
her
opinion
was
conveyed."
"But
how
does
she
feel?"
"Till
you
shocked
her
(she
said
you
had
shocked
her,
but
she
would
not
tell
me
how)
she
felt
as
a
sister
feels
towards
a
brother
of
whom
she
is
at
once
fond
and
proud."
"I'll
shock
her
no
more,
Cary,
for
the
shock
rebounded
on
myself
till
I
staggered
again.
But
that
comparison
about
sister
and
brother
is
all
nonsense.
She
is
too
rich
and
proud
to
entertain
fraternal
sentiments
for
me."
"You
don't
know
her,
Robert;
and,
somehow,
I
fancy
now
(I
had
other
ideas
formerly)
that
you
cannot
know
her.
You
and
she
are
not
so
constructed
as
to
be
able
thoroughly
to
understand
each
other."
"It
may
be
so.
I
esteem
her,
I
admire
her;
and
yet
my
impressions
concerning
her
are
harsh
perhaps
uncharitable.
I
believe,
for
instance,
that
she
is
incapable
of
love
"
"Shirley
incapable
of
love!"
"That
she
will
never
marry.
I
imagine
her
jealous
of
compromising
her
pride,
of
relinquishing
her
power,
of
sharing
her
property."
"Shirley
has
hurt
your
amour
propre."
"She
did
hurt
it;
though
I
had
not
an
emotion
of
tenderness,
nor
a
spark
of
passion
for
her."
"Then,
Robert,
it
was
very
wicked
in
you
to
want
to
marry
her."
"And
very
mean,
my
little
pastor,
my
pretty
priestess.
I
never
wanted
to
kiss
Miss
Keeldar
in
my
life,
though
she
has
fine
lips,
scarlet
and
round
as
ripe
cherries;
or,
if
I
did
wish
it,
it
was
the
mere
desire
of
the
eye."
"I
doubt,
now,
whether
you
are
speaking
the
truth.
The
grapes
or
the
cherries
are
sour
'hung
too
high.'"
"She
has
a
pretty
figure,
a
pretty
face,
beautiful
hair.
I
acknowledge
all
her
charms
and
feel
none
of
them,
or
only
feel
them
in
a
way
she
would
disdain.
I
suppose
I
was
truly
tempted
by
the
mere
gilding
of
the
bait.
Caroline,
what
a
noble
fellow
your
Robert
is
great,
good,
disinterested,
and
then
so
pure!"
"But
not
perfect.
He
made
a
great
blunder
once,
and
we
will
hear
no
more
about
it."
"And
shall
we
think
no
more
about
it,
Cary?
Shall
we
not
despise
him
in
our
heart
gentle
but
just,
compassionate
but
upright?"
"Never!
We
will
remember
that
with
what
measure
we
mete
it
shall
be
measured
unto
us,
and
so
we
will
give
no
scorn,
only
affection."
"Which
won't
satisfy,
I
warn
you
of
that.
Something
besides
affection
something
far
stronger,
sweeter,
warmer
will
be
demanded
one
day.
Is
it
there
to
give?"
Caroline
was
moved,
much
moved.
"Be
calm,
Lina,"
said
Moore
soothingly.
"I
have
no
intention,
because
I
have
no
right,
to
perturb
your
mind
now,
nor
for
months
to
come.
Don't
look
as
if
you
would
leave
me.
We
will
make
no
more
agitating
allusions;
we
will
resume
our
gossip.
Do
not
tremble;
look
me
in
the
face.
See
what
a
poor,
pale,
grim
phantom
I
am
more
pitiable
than
formidable."
She
looked
shyly.
"There
is
something
formidable
still,
pale
as
you
are,"
she
said,
as
her
eye
fell
under
his.
"To
return
to
Shirley,"
pursued
Moore:
"is
it
your
opinion
that
she
is
ever
likely
to
marry?"
"She
loves."
"Platonically
theoretically
all
humbug!"
"She
loves
what
I
call
sincerely."
"Did
she
say
so?"
"I
cannot
affirm
that
she
said
so.
No
such
confession
as
'I
love
this
man
or
that'
passed
her
lips."
"I
thought
not."
"But
the
feeling
made
its
way
in
spite
of
her,
and
I
saw
it.
She
spoke
of
one
man
in
a
strain
not
to
be
misunderstood.
Her
voice
alone
was
sufficient
testimony.
Having
wrung
from
her
an
opinion
on
your
character,
I
demanded
a
second
opinion
of
another
person
about
whom
I
had
my
conjectures,
though
they
were
the
most
tangled
and
puzzled
conjectures
in
the
world.
I
would
make
her
speak.
I
shook
her,
I
chid
her,
I
pinched
her
fingers
when
she
tried
to
put
me
off
with
gibes
and
jests
in
her
queer
provoking
way,
and
at
last
out
it
came.
The
voice,
I
say,
was
enough;
hardly
raised
above
a
whisper,
and
yet
such
a
soft
vehemence
in
its
tones.
There
was
no
confession,
no
confidence,
in
the
matter.
To
these
things
she
cannot
condescend;
but
I
am
sure
that
man's
happiness
is
dear
to
her
as
her
own
life."
"Who
is
it?"
"I
charged
her
with
the
fact.
She
did
not
deny,
she
did
not
avow,
but
looked
at
me.
I
saw
her
eyes
by
the
snow
gleam.
It
was
quite
enough.
I
triumphed
over
her
mercilessly."
"What
right
had
you
to
triumph?
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
fancy
free?"
"Whatever
I
am,
Shirley
is
a
bondswoman.
Lioness,
she
has
found
her
captor.
Mistress
she
may
be
of
all
round
her,
but
her
own
mistress
she
is
not."
"So
you
exulted
at
recognizing
a
fellow
slave
in
one
so
fair
and
imperial?"
"I
did;
Robert,
you
say
right,
in
one
so
fair
and
imperial."
"You
confess
it
a
fellow
slave?"
"I
confess
nothing;
but
I
say
that
haughty
Shirley
is
no
more
free
than
was
Hagar."
"And
who,
pray,
is
the
Abraham,
the
hero
of
a
patriarch
who
has
achieved
such
a
conquest?"
"You
still
speak
scornfully,
and
cynically,
and
sorely;
but
I
will
make
you
change
your
note
before
I
have
done
with
you."
"We
will
see
that.
Can
she
marry
this
Cupidon?"
"Cupidon!
he
is
just
about
as
much
a
Cupidon
as
you
are
a
Cyclops."
"Can
she
marry
him?"
"You
will
see."
"I
want
to
know
his
name,
Cary."
"Guess
it."
"Is
it
any
one
in
this
neighbourhood?"
"Yes,
in
Briarfield
parish."
"Then
it
is
some
person
unworthy
of
her.
I
don't
know
a
soul
in
Briarfield
parish
her
equal."
"Guess."
"Impossible.
I
suppose
she
is
under
a
delusion,
and
will
plunge
into
some
absurdity,
after
all."
Caroline
smiled.
"Do
you
approve
the
choice?"
asked
Moore.
"Quite,
quite."
"Then
I
am
puzzled;
for
the
head
which
owns
this
bounteous
fall
of
hazel
curls
is
an
excellent
little
thinking
machine,
most
accurate
in
its
working.
It
boasts
a
correct,
steady
judgment,
inherited
from
'mamma,'
I
suppose."
"And
I
quite
approve,
and
mamma
was
charmed."
"'Mamma'
charmed
Mrs.
Pryor!
It
can't
be
romantic,
then?"
"It
is
romantic,
but
it
is
also
right."
"Tell
me,
Cary
tell
me
out
of
pity;
I
am
too
weak
to
be
tantalized."
"You
shall
be
tantalized
it
will
do
you
no
harm;
you
are
not
so
weak
as
you
pretend."
"I
have
twice
this
evening
had
some
thoughts
of
falling
on
the
floor
at
your
feet."
"You
had
better
not.
I
shall
decline
to
help
you
up."
"And
worshipping
you
downright.
My
mother
was
a
Roman
Catholic.
You
look
like
the
loveliest
of
her
pictures
of
the
Virgin.
I
think
I
will
embrace
her
faith
and
kneel
and
adore."
"Robert,
Robert,
sit
still;
don't
be
absurd.
I
will
go
to
Hortense
if
you
commit
extravagances."
"You
have
stolen
my
senses.
Just
now
nothing
will
come
into
my
mind
but
les
litanies
de
la
sainte
Vierge.
Rose
celeste,
reine
des
anges!"
"Tour
d'ivoire,
maison
d'or
is
not
that
the
jargon?
Well,
sit
down
quietly,
and
guess
your
riddle."
"But
'mamma'
charmed
there's
the
puzzle."
"I'll
tell
you
what
mamma
said
when
I
told
her.
'Depend
upon
it,
my
dear,
such
a
choice
will
make
the
happiness
of
Miss
Keeldar's
life.'"
"I'll
guess
once,
and
no
more.
It
is
old
Helstone.
She
is
going
to
be
your
aunt."
"I'll
tell
my
uncle;
I'll
tell
Shirley!"
cried
Caroline,
laughing
gleefully.
"Guess
again,
Robert;
your
blunders
are
charming."
"It
is
the
parson
Hall."
"Indeed,
no;
he
is
mine,
if
you
please."
"Yours!
Ay,
the
whole
generation
of
women
in
Briarfield
seem
to
have
made
an
idol
of
that
priest.
I
wonder
why;
he
is
bald,
sand
blind,
gray
haired."
"Fanny
will
be
here
to
fetch
me
before
you
have
solved
the
riddle,
if
you
don't
make
haste."
"I'll
guess
no
more
I
am
tired;
and
then
I
don't
care.
Miss
Keeldar
may
marry
le
grand
Turc
for
me."
"Must
I
whisper?"
"That
you
must,
and
quickly.
Here
comes
Hortense;
come
near,
a
little
nearer,
my
own
Lina.
I
care
for
the
whisper
more
than
the
words."
She
whispered.
Robert
gave
a
start,
a
flash
of
the
eye,
a
brief
laugh.
Miss
Moore
entered,
and
Sarah
followed
behind,
with
information
that
Fanny
was
come.
The
hour
of
converse
was
over.
Robert
found
a
moment
to
exchange
a
few
more
whispered
sentences.
He
was
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
as
Caroline
descended
after
putting
on
her
shawl.
"Must
I
call
Shirley
a
noble
creature
now?"
he
asked.
"If
you
wish
to
speak
the
truth,
certainly."
"Must
I
forgive
her?"
"Forgive
her?
Naughty
Robert!
Was
she
in
the
wrong,
or
were
you?"
"Must
I
at
length
love
her
downright,
Cary?"
Caroline
looked
keenly
up,
and
made
a
movement
towards
him,
something
between
the
loving
and
the
petulant.
"Only
give
the
word,
and
I'll
try
to
obey
you."
"Indeed,
you
must
not
love
her;
the
bare
idea
is
perverse."
"But
then
she
is
handsome,
peculiarly
handsome.
Hers
is
a
beauty
that
grows
on
you.
You
think
her
but
graceful
when
you
first
see
her;
you
discover
her
to
be
beautiful
when
you
have
known
her
for
a
year."
"It
is
not
you
who
are
to
say
these
things.
Now,
Robert,
be
good."
"O
Cary,
I
have
no
love
to
give.
Were
the
goddess
of
beauty
to
woo
me,
I
could
not
meet
her
advances.
There
is
no
heart
which
I
can
call
mine
in
this
breast."
"So
much
the
better;
you
are
a
great
deal
safer
without.
Good
night."
"Why
must
you
always
go,
Lina,
at
the
very
instant
when
I
most
want
you
to
stay?"
"Because
you
most
wish
to
retain
when
you
are
most
certain
to
lose."
"Listen;
one
other
word.
Take
care
of
your
own
heart
do
you
hear
me?"
"There
is
no
danger."
"I
am
not
convinced
of
that.
The
Platonic
parson,
for
instance."
"Who
Malone?"
"Cyril
Hall.
I
owe
more
than
one
twinge
of
jealousy
to
that
quarter."
"As
to
you,
you
have
been
flirting
with
Miss
Mann.
She
showed
me
the
other
day
a
plant
you
had
given
her.
Fanny,
I
am
ready."
Louis
Moore's
doubts
respecting
the
immediate
evacuation
of
Fieldhead
by
Mr.
Sympson
turned
out
to
be
perfectly
well
founded.
The
very
next
day
after
the
grand
quarrel
about
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
a
sort
of
reconciliation
was
patched
up
between
uncle
and
niece.
Shirley,
who
could
never
find
it
in
her
heart
to
be
or
to
seem
inhospitable
(except
in
the
single
instance
of
Mr.
Donne),
begged
the
whole
party
to
stay
a
little
longer.
She
begged
in
such
earnest
it
was
evident
she
wished
it
for
some
reason.
They
took
her
at
her
word.
Indeed,
the
uncle
could
not
bring
himself
to
leave
her
quite
unwatched
at
full
liberty
to
marry
Robert
Moore
as
soon
as
that
gentleman
should
be
able
(Mr.
Sympson
piously
prayed
this
might
never
be
the
case)
to
reassert
his
supposed
pretensions
to
her
hand.
They
all
stayed.
In
his
first
rage
against
all
the
house
of
Moore,
Mr.
Sympson
had
so
conducted
himself
towards
Mr.
Louis
that
that
gentleman
patient
of
labour
or
suffering,
but
intolerant
of
coarse
insolence
had
promptly
resigned
his
post,
and
could
now
be
induced
to
resume
and
retain
it
only
till
such
time
as
the
family
should
quit
Yorkshire.
Mrs.
Sympson's
entreaties
prevailed
with
him
thus
far;
his
own
attachment
to
his
pupil
constituted
an
additional
motive
for
concession;
and
probably
he
had
a
third
motive,
stronger
than
either
of
the
other
two.
Probably
he
would
have
found
it
very
hard
indeed
to
leave
Fieldhead
just
now.
Things
went
on
for
some
time
pretty
smoothly.
Miss
Keeldar's
health
was
re
established;
her
spirits
resumed
their
flow.
Moore
had
found
means
to
relieve
her
from
every
nervous
apprehension;
and,
indeed,
from
the
moment
of
giving
him
her
confidence,
every
fear
seemed
to
have
taken
wing.
Her
heart
became
as
lightsome,
her
manner
as
careless,
as
those
of
a
little
child,
that,
thoughtless
of
its
own
life
or
death,
trusts
all
responsibility
to
its
parents.
He
and
William
Farren
through
whose
medium
he
made
inquiries
concerning
the
state
of
Pheabe
agreed
in
asserting
that
the
dog
was
not
mad,
that
it
was
only
ill
usage
which
had
driven
her
from
home;
for
it
was
proved
that
her
master
was
in
the
frequent
habit
of
chastising
her
violently.
Their
assertion
might
or
might
not
be
true.
The
groom
and
gamekeeper
affirmed
to
the
contrary
both
asserting
that,
if
hers
was
not
a
clear
case
of
hydrophobia,
there
was
no
such
disease.
But
to
this
evidence
Louis
Moore
turned
an
incredulous
ear.
He
reported
to
Shirley
only
what
was
encouraging.
She
believed
him;
and,
right
or
wrong,
it
is
certain
that
in
her
case
the
bite
proved
innocuous.
November
passed;
December
came.
The
Sympsons
were
now
really
departing.
It
was
incumbent
on
them
to
be
at
home
by
Christmas.
Their
packages
were
preparing;
they
were
to
leave
in
a
few
days.
One
winter
evening,
during
the
last
week
of
their
stay,
Louis
Moore
again
took
out
his
little
blank
book,
and
discoursed
with
it
as
follows:
"She
is
lovelier
than
ever.
Since
that
little
cloud
was
dispelled
all
the
temporary
waste
and
wanness
have
vanished.
It
was
marvellous
to
see
how
soon
the
magical
energy
of
youth
raised
her
elastic
and
revived
her
blooming.
"After
breakfast
this
morning,
when
I
had
seen
her,
and
listened
to
her,
and,
so
to
speak,
felt
her,
in
every
sentient
atom
of
my
frame,
I
passed
from
her
sunny
presence
into
the
chill
drawing
room.
Taking
up
a
little
gilt
volume,
I
found
it
to
contain
a
selection
of
lyrics.
I
read
a
poem
or
two;
whether
the
spell
was
in
me
or
in
the
verse
I
know
not,
but
my
heart
filled
genially,
my
pulse
rose.
I
glowed,
notwithstanding
the
frost
air.
I,
too,
am
young
as
yet.
Though
she
said
she
never
considered
me
young,
I
am
barely
thirty.
There
are
moments
when
life,
for
no
other
reason
than
my
own
youth,
beams
with
sweet
hues
upon
me.
"It
was
time
to
go
to
the
schoolroom.
I
went.
That
same
schoolroom
is
rather
pleasant
in
a
morning.
The
sun
then
shines
through
the
low
lattice;
the
books
are
in
order;
there
are
no
papers
strewn
about;
the
fire
is
clear
and
clean;
no
cinders
have
fallen,
no
ashes
accumulated.
I
found
Henry
there,
and
he
had
brought
with
him
Miss
Keeldar.
They
were
together.
"I
said
she
was
lovelier
than
ever.
She
is.
A
fine
rose,
not
deep
but
delicate,
opens
on
her
cheek.
Her
eye,
always
dark,
clear,
and
speaking,
utters
now
a
language
I
cannot
render;
it
is
the
utterance,
seen
not
heard,
through
which
angels
must
have
communed
when
there
was
'silence
in
heaven.'
Her
hair
was
always
dusk
as
night
and
fine
as
silk,
her
neck
was
always
fair,
flexible,
polished;
but
both
have
now
a
new
charm.
The
tresses
are
soft
as
shadow,
the
shoulders
they
fall
on
wear
a
goddess
grace.
Once
I
only
saw
her
beauty,
now
I
feel
it.
"Henry
was
repeating
his
lesson
to
her
before
bringing
it
to
me.
One
of
her
hands
was
occupied
with
the
book;
he
held
the
other.
That
boy
gets
more
than
his
share
of
privileges;
he
dares
caress
and
is
caressed.
What
indulgence
and
compassion
she
shows
him!
Too
much.
If
this
went
on,
Henry
in
a
few
years,
when
his
soul
was
formed,
would
offer
it
on
her
altar,
as
I
have
offered
mine.
"I
saw
her
eyelid
flitter
when
I
came
in,
but
she
did
not
look
up;
now
she
hardly
ever
gives
me
a
glance.
She
seems
to
grow
silent
too;
to
me
she
rarely
speaks,
and
when
I
am
present,
she
says
little
to
others.
In
my
gloomy
moments
I
attribute
this
change
to
indifference,
aversion,
what
not?
In
my
sunny
intervals
I
give
it
another
meaning.
I
say,
were
I
her
equal,
I
could
find
in
this
shyness
coyness,
and
in
that
coyness
love.
As
it
is,
dare
I
look
for
it?
What
could
I
do
with
it
if
found?
"This
morning
I
dared
at
least
contrive
an
hour's
communion
for
her
and
me;
I
dared
not
only
wish
but
will
an
interview
with
her.
I
dared
summon
solitude
to
guard
us.
Very
decidedly
I
called
Henry
to
the
door.
Without
hesitation
I
said,
'Go
where
you
will,
my
boy;
but,
till
I
call
you,
return
not
here.'
"Henry,
I
could
see,
did
not
like
his
dismissal.
That
boy
is
young,
but
a
thinker;
his
meditative
eye
shines
on
me
strangely
sometimes.
He
half
feels
what
links
me
to
Shirley;
he
half
guesses
that
there
is
a
dearer
delight
in
the
reserve
with
which
I
am
treated
than
in
all
the
endearments
he
is
allowed.
The
young,
lame,
half
grown
lion
would
growl
at
me
now
and
then,
because
I
have
tamed
his
lioness
and
am
her
keeper,
did
not
the
habit
of
discipline
and
the
instinct
of
affection
hold
him
subdued.
Go,
Henry;
you
must
learn
to
take
your
share
of
the
bitter
of
life
with
all
of
Adam's
race
that
have
gone
before
or
will
come
after
you.
Your
destiny
can
be
no
exception
to
the
common
lot;
be
grateful
that
your
love
is
overlooked
thus
early,
before
it
can
claim
any
affinity
to
passion.
An
hour's
fret,
a
pang
of
envy,
suffice
to
express
what
you
feel.
Jealousy
hot
as
the
sun
above
the
line,
rage
destructive
as
the
tropic
storm,
the
clime
of
your
sensations
ignores
as
yet.
"I
took
my
usual
seat
at
the
desk,
quite
in
my
usual
way.
I
am
blessed
in
that
power
to
cover
all
inward
ebullition
with
outward
calm.
No
one
who
looks
at
my
slow
face
can
guess
the
vortex
sometimes
whirling
in
my
heart,
and
engulfing
thought
and
wrecking
prudence.
Pleasant
is
it
to
have
the
gift
to
proceed
peacefully
and
powerfully
in
your
course
without
alarming
by
one
eccentric
movement.
It
was
not
my
present
intention
to
utter
one
word
of
love
to
her,
or
to
reveal
one
glimpse
of
the
fire
in
which
I
wasted.
Presumptuous
I
never
have
been;
presumptuous
I
never
will
be.
Rather
than
even
seem
selfish
and
interested,
I
would
resolutely
rise,
gird
my
loins,
part
and
leave
her,
and
seek,
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe,
a
new
life,
cold
and
barren
as
the
rock
the
salt
tide
daily
washes.
My
design
this
morning
was
to
take
of
her
a
near
scrutiny
to
read
a
line
in
the
page
of
her
heart.
Before
I
left
I
determined
to
know
what
I
was
leaving.
"I
had
some
quills
to
make
into
pens.
Most
men's
hands
would
have
trembled
when
their
hearts
were
so
stirred;
mine
went
to
work
steadily,
and
my
voice,
when
I
called
it
into
exercise,
was
firm.
"'This
day
week
you
will
be
alone
at
Fieldhead,
Miss
Keeldar.'
"'Yes:
I
rather
think
my
uncle's
intention
to
go
is
a
settled
one
now.'
"'He
leaves
you
dissatisfied.'
"'He
is
not
pleased
with
me.'
"'He
departs
as
he
came
no
better
for
his
journey.
This
is
mortifying.'
"'I
trust
the
failure
of
his
plans
will
take
from
him
all
inclination
to
lay
new
ones.'
"'In
his
way
Mr.
Sympson
honestly
wished
you
well.
All
he
has
done
or
intended
to
do
he
believed
to
be
for
the
best.'
"'You
are
kind
to
undertake
the
defence
of
a
man
who
has
permitted
himself
to
treat
you
with
so
much
insolence.'
"'I
never
feel
shocked
at,
or
bear
malice
for,
what
is
spoken
in
character;
and
most
perfectly
in
character
was
that
vulgar
and
violent
onset
against
me,
when
he
had
quitted
you
worsted.'
"'You
cease
now
to
be
Henry's
tutor?'
"'I
shall
be
parted
from
Henry
for
a
while
(if
he
and
I
live
we
shall
meet
again
somehow,
for
we
love
each
other)
and
be
ousted
from
the
bosom
of
the
Sympson
family
for
ever.
Happily
this
change
does
not
leave
me
stranded;
it
but
hurries
into
premature
execution
designs
long
formed.'
"'No
change
finds
you
off
your
guard.
I
was
sure,
in
your
calm
way,
you
would
be
prepared
for
sudden
mutation.
I
always
think
you
stand
in
the
world
like
a
solitary
but
watchful,
thoughtful
archer
in
a
wood.
And
the
quiver
on
your
shoulder
holds
more
arrows
than
one;
your
bow
is
provided
with
a
second
string.
Such
too
is
your
brother's
wont.
You
two
might
go
forth
homeless
hunters
to
the
loneliest
western
wilds;
all
would
be
well
with
you.
The
hewn
tree
would
make
you
a
hut,
the
cleared
forest
yield
you
fields
from
its
stripped
bosom,
the
buffalo
would
feel
your
rifle
shot,
and
with
lowered
horns
and
hump
pay
homage
at
your
feet.'
"'And
any
Indian
tribe
of
Blackfeet
or
Flatheads
would
afford
us
a
bride,
perhaps?'
"'No'
(hesitating),
'I
think
not.
The
savage
is
sordid.
I
think
that
is,
I
hope
you
would
neither
of
you
share
your
hearth
with
that
to
which
you
could
not
give
your
heart.'
"'What
suggested
the
wild
West
to
your
mind,
Miss
Keeldar?
Have
you
been
with
me
in
spirit
when
I
did
not
see
you?
Have
you
entered
into
my
day
dreams,
and
beheld
my
brain
labouring
at
its
scheme
of
a
future?'
"She
had
separated
a
slip
of
paper
for
lighting
tapers
a
spill,
as
it
is
called
into
fragments.
She
threw
morsel
by
morsel
into
the
fire,
and
stood
pensively
watching
them
consume.
She
did
not
speak.
"'How
did
you
learn
what
you
seem
to
know
about
my
intentions?'
"'I
know
nothing.
I
am
only
discovering
them
now.
I
spoke
at
hazard.'
"'Your
hazard
sounds
like
divination.
A
tutor
I
will
never
be
again;
never
take
a
pupil
after
Henry
and
yourself;
not
again
will
I
sit
habitually
at
another
man's
table
no
more
be
the
appendage
of
a
family.
I
am
now
a
man
of
thirty;
I
have
never
been
free
since
I
was
a
boy
of
ten.
I
have
such
a
thirst
for
freedom,
such
a
deep
passion
to
know
her
and
call
her
mine,
such
a
day
desire
and
night
longing
to
win
her
and
possess
her,
I
will
not
refuse
to
cross
the
Atlantic
for
her
sake;
her
I
will
follow
deep
into
virgin
woods.
Mine
it
shall
not
be
to
accept
a
savage
girl
as
a
slave
she
could
not
be
a
wife.
I
know
no
white
woman
whom
I
love
that
would
accompany
me;
but
I
am
certain
Liberty
will
await
me,
sitting
under
a
pine.
When
I
call
her
she
will
come
to
my
loghouse,
and
she
shall
fill
my
arms.'
"She
could
not
hear
me
speak
so
unmoved,
and
she
was
moved.
It
was
right
I
meant
to
move
her.
She
could
not
answer
me,
nor
could
she
look
at
me.
I
should
have
been
sorry
if
she
could
have
done
either.
Her
cheek
glowed
as
if
a
crimson
flower
through
whose
petals
the
sun
shone
had
cast
its
light
upon
it.
On
the
white
lid
and
dark
lashes
of
her
downcast
eye
trembled
all
that
is
graceful
in
the
sense
of
half
painful,
half
pleasing
shame.
"Soon
she
controlled
her
emotion,
and
took
all
her
feelings
under
command.
I
saw
she
had
felt
insurrection,
and
was
waking
to
empire.
She
sat
down.
There
was
that
in
her
face
which
I
could
read.
It
said,
I
see
the
line
which
is
my
limit;
nothing
shall
make
me
pass
it.
I
feel
I
know
how
far
I
may
reveal
my
feelings,
and
when
I
must
clasp
the
volume.
I
have
advanced
to
a
certain
distance,
as
far
as
the
true
and
sovereign
and
undegraded
nature
of
my
kind
permits;
now
here
I
stand
rooted.
My
heart
may
break
if
it
is
baffled;
let
it
break.
It
shall
never
dishonour
me;
it
shall
never
dishonour
my
sisterhood
in
me.
Suffering
before
degradation!
death
before
treachery!
"I,
for
my
part,
said,
'If
she
were
poor,
I
would
be
at
her
feet;
if
she
were
lowly,
I
would
take
her
in
my
arms.
Her
gold
and
her
station
are
two
griffins
that
guard
her
on
each
side.
Love
looks
and
longs,
and
dares
not;
Passion
hovers
round,
and
is
kept
at
bay;
Truth
and
Devotion
are
scared.
There
is
nothing
to
lose
in
winning
her,
no
sacrifice
to
make.
It
is
all
clear
gain,
and
therefore
unimaginably
difficult.'
"Difficult
or
not,
something
must
be
done,
something
must
be
said.
I
could
not,
and
would
not,
sit
silent
with
all
that
beauty
modestly
mute
in
my
presence.
I
spoke
thus,
and
still
I
spoke
with
calm.
Quiet
as
my
words
were,
I
could
hear
they
fell
in
a
tone
distinct,
round,
and
deep.
"'Still,
I
know
I
shall
be
strangely
placed
with
that
mountain
nymph
Liberty.
She
is,
I
suspect,
akin
to
that
Solitude
which
I
once
wooed,
and
from
which
I
now
seek
a
divorce.
These
Oreads
are
peculiar.
They
come
upon
you
with
an
unearthly
charm,
like
some
starlight
evening;
they
inspire
a
wild
but
not
warm
delight;
their
beauty
is
the
beauty
of
spirits;
their
grace
is
not
the
grace
of
life,
but
of
seasons
or
scenes
in
nature.
Theirs
is
the
dewy
bloom
of
morning,
the
languid
flush
of
evening,
the
peace
of
the
moon,
the
changefulness
of
clouds.
I
want
and
will
have
something
different.
This
elfish
splendour
looks
chill
to
my
vision,
and
feels
frozen
to
my
touch.
I
am
not
a
poet;
I
cannot
live
with
abstractions.
You,
Miss
Keeldar,
have
sometimes,
in
your
laughing
satire,
called
me
a
material
philosopher,
and
implied
that
I
live
sufficiently
for
the
substantial.
Certainly
I
feel
material
from
head
to
foot;
and
glorious
as
Nature
is,
and
deeply
as
I
worship
her
with
the
solid
powers
of
a
solid
heart,
I
would
rather
behold
her
through
the
soft
human
eyes
of
a
loved
and
lovely
wife
than
through
the
wild
orbs
of
the
highest
goddess
of
Olympus.'
"'Juno
could
not
cook
a
buffalo
steak
as
you
like
it,'
said
she.
"'She
could
not;
but
I
will
tell
you
who
could
some
young,
penniless,
friendless
orphan
girl.
I
wish
I
could
find
such
a
one
pretty
enough
for
me
to
love,
with
something
of
the
mind
and
heart
suited
to
my
taste;
not
uneducated
honest
and
modest.
I
care
nothing
for
attainments,
but
I
would
fain
have
the
germ
of
those
sweet
natural
powers
which
nothing
acquired
can
rival;
any
temper
Fate
wills
I
can
manage
the
hottest.
To
such
a
creature
as
this
I
should
like
to
be
first
tutor
and
then
husband.
I
would
teach
her
my
language,
my
habits
and
my
principles,
and
then
I
would
reward
her
with
my
love.'
"'Reward
her,
lord
of
the
creation
reward
her!'"
ejaculated
she,
with
a
curled
lip.
"'And
be
repaid
a
thousandfold.'
"'If
she
willed
it,
monseigneur.'
"'And
she
should
will
it.'
"'You
have
stipulated
for
any
temper
Fate
wills.
Compulsion
is
flint
and
a
blow
to
the
metal
of
some
souls.'
"'And
love
the
spark
it
elicits.'
"'Who
cares
for
the
love
that
is
but
a
spark
seen,
flown
upward,
and
gone?'
"'I
must
find
my
orphan
girl.
Tell
me
how,
Miss
Keeldar.'
"'Advertise;
and
be
sure
you
add,
when
you
describe
the
qualifications,
she
must
be
a
good
plain
cook.'
"'I
must
find
her;
and
when
I
do
find
her
I
shall
marry
her.'
"'Not
you!'
and
her
voice
took
a
sudden
accent
of
peculiar
scorn.
"I
liked
this.
I
had
roused
her
from
the
pensive
mood
in
which
I
had
first
found
her.
I
would
stir
her
further.
"'Why
doubt
it?'
"'You
marry!'
"'Yes,
of
course;
nothing
more
evident
than
that
I
can
and
shall.'
"'The
contrary
is
evident,
Mr.
Moore.'
"She
charmed
me
in
this
mood
waxing
disdainful,
half
insulting;
pride,
temper,
derision,
blent
in
her
large
fine
eye,
that
had
just
now
the
look
of
a
merlin's.
"'Favour
me
with
your
reasons
for
such
an
opinion,
Miss
Keeldar.'
"'How
will
you
manage
to
marry,
I
wonder?'
"'I
shall
manage
it
with
ease
and
speed
when
I
find
the
proper
person.'
"'Accept
celibacy!'
(and
she
made
a
gesture
with
her
hand
as
if
she
gave
me
something)
'take
it
as
your
doom!'
"'No;
you
cannot
give
what
I
already
have.
Celibacy
has
been
mine
for
thirty
years.
If
you
wish
to
offer
me
a
gift,
a
parting
present,
a
keepsake,
you
must
change
the
boon.'
"'Take
worse,
then!'
"'How
what?'
"I
now
felt,
and
looked,
and
spoke
eagerly.
I
was
unwise
to
quit
my
sheet
anchor
of
calm
even
for
an
instant;
it
deprived
me
of
an
advantage
and
transferred
it
to
her.
The
little
spark
of
temper
dissolved
in
sarcasm,
and
eddied
over
her
countenance
in
the
ripples
of
a
mocking
smile.
"'Take
a
wife
that
has
paid
you
court
to
save
your
modesty,
and
thrust
herself
upon
you
to
spare
your
scruples.'
"'Only
show
me
where.'
"'Any
stout
widow
that
has
had
a
few
husbands
already,
and
can
manage
these
things.'
"'She
must
not
be
rich,
then.
Oh
these
riches!'
"'Never
would
you
have
gathered
the
produce
of
the
gold
bearing
garden.
You
have
not
courage
to
confront
the
sleepless
dragon;
you
have
not
craft
to
borrow
the
aid
of
Atlas.'
"'You
look
hot
and
haughty.'
"'And
you
far
haughtier.
Yours
is
the
monstrous
pride
which
counterfeits
humility.'
"'I
am
a
dependant;
I
know
my
place.'
"'I
am
a
woman;
I
know
mine.'
"'I
am
poor;
I
must
be
proud.'
"'I
have
received
ordinances,
and
own
obligations
stringent
as
yours.'
"We
had
reached
a
critical
point
now,
and
we
halted
and
looked
at
each
other.
She
would
not
give
in,
I
felt.
Beyond
this
I
neither
felt
nor
saw.
A
few
moments
yet
were
mine.
The
end
was
coming
I
heard
its
rush
but
not
come.
I
would
dally,
wait,
talk,
and
when
impulse
urged
I
would
act.
I
am
never
in
a
hurry;
I
never
was
in
a
hurry
in
my
whole
life.
Hasty
people
drink
the
nectar
of
existence
scalding
hot;
I
taste
it
cool
as
dew.
I
proceeded:
'Apparently,
Miss
Keeldar,
you
are
as
little
likely
to
marry
as
myself.
I
know
you
have
refused
three
nay,
four
advantageous
offers,
and,
I
believe,
a
fifth.
Have
you
rejected
Sir
Philip
Nunnely?'
"I
put
this
question
suddenly
and
promptly.
"'Did
you
think
I
should
take
him?'
"'I
thought
you
might.'
"'On
what
grounds,
may
I
ask?'
"'Conformity
of
rank,
age,
pleasing
contrast
of
temper
for
he
is
mild
and
amiable
harmony
of
intellectual
tastes.'
"'A
beautiful
sentence!
Let
us
take
it
to
pieces.
"Conformity
of
rank."
He
is
quite
above
me.
Compare
my
grange
with
his
palace,
if
you
please.
I
am
disdained
by
his
kith
and
kin.
"Suitability
of
age."
We
were
born
in
the
same
year;
consequently
he
is
still
a
boy,
while
I
am
a
woman
ten
years
his
senior
to
all
intents
and
purposes.
"Contrast
of
temper."
Mild
and
amiable,
is
he;
I
what?
Tell
me.'
"'Sister
of
the
spotted,
bright,
quick,
fiery
leopard.'
"'And
you
would
mate
me
with
a
kid
the
millennium
being
yet
millions
of
centuries
from
mankind;
being
yet,
indeed,
an
archangel
high
in
the
seventh
heaven,
uncommissioned
to
descend?
Unjust
barbarian!
"Harmony
of
intellectual
tastes."
He
is
fond
of
poetry,
and
I
hate
it
'
"'Do
you?
That
is
news.'
"'I
absolutely
shudder
at
the
sight
of
metre
or
at
the
sound
of
rhyme
whenever
I
am
at
the
priory
or
Sir
Philip
at
Fieldhead.
Harmony,
indeed!
When
did
I
whip
up
syllabub
sonnets
or
string
stanzas
fragile
as
fragments
of
glass?
and
when
did
I
betray
a
belief
that
those
penny
beads
were
genuine
brilliants?'
"'You
might
have
the
satisfaction
of
leading
him
to
a
higher
standard,
of
improving
his
tastes.'
"'Leading
and
improving!
teaching
and
tutoring!
bearing
and
forbearing!
Pah!
my
husband
is
not
to
be
my
baby.
I
am
not
to
set
him
his
daily
lesson
and
see
that
he
learns
it,
and
give
him
a
sugar
plum
if
he
is
good,
and
a
patient,
pensive,
pathetic
lecture
if
he
is
bad.
But
it
is
like
a
tutor
to
talk
of
the
"satisfaction
of
teaching."
I
suppose
you
think
it
the
finest
employment
in
the
world.
I
don't.
I
reject
it.
Improving
a
husband!
No.
I
shall
insist
upon
my
husband
improving
me,
or
else
we
part.'
"'God
knows
it
is
needed!'
"'What
do
you
mean
by
that,
Mr.
Moore?'
"'What
I
say.
Improvement
is
imperatively
needed.'
"'If
you
were
a
woman
you
would
school
monsieur,
votre
mari,
charmingly.
It
would
just
suit
you;
schooling
is
your
vocation.'
"'May
I
ask
whether,
in
your
present
just
and
gentle
mood,
you
mean
to
taunt
me
with
being
a
tutor?'
"'Yes,
bitterly;
and
with
anything
else
you
please
any
defect
of
which
you
are
painfully
conscious.'
"'With
being
poor,
for
instance?'
"'Of
course;
that
will
sting
you.
You
are
sore
about
your
poverty;
you
brood
over
that.'
"'With
having
nothing
but
a
very
plain
person
to
offer
the
woman
who
may
master
my
heart?'
"'Exactly.
You
have
a
habit
of
calling
yourself
plain.
You
are
sensitive
about
the
cut
of
your
features
because
they
are
not
quite
on
an
Apollo
pattern.
You
abase
them
more
than
is
needful,
in
the
faint
hope
that
others
may
say
a
word
in
their
behalf
which
won't
happen.
Your
face
is
nothing
to
boast
of,
certainly
not
a
pretty
line
nor
a
pretty
tint
to
be
found
therein.'
"'Compare
it
with
your
own.'
"'It
looks
like
a
god
of
Egypt
a
great
sand
buried
stone
head;
or
rather
I
will
compare
it
to
nothing
so
lofty.
It
looks
like
Tartar.
You
are
my
mastiff's
cousin.
I
think
you
as
much
like
him
as
a
man
can
be
like
a
dog.'
"'Tartar
is
your
dear
companion.
In
summer,
when
you
rise
early,
and
run
out
into
the
fields
to
wet
your
feet
with
the
dew,
and
freshen
your
cheek
and
uncurl
your
hair
with
the
breeze,
you
always
call
him
to
follow
you.
You
call
him
sometimes
with
a
whistle
that
you
learned
from
me.
In
the
solitude
of
your
wood,
when
you
think
nobody
but
Tartar
is
listening,
you
whistle
the
very
tunes
you
imitated
from
my
lips,
or
sing
the
very
songs
you
have
caught
up
by
ear
from
my
voice.
I
do
not
ask
whence
flows
the
feeling
which
you
pour
into
these
songs,
for
I
know
it
flows
out
of
your
heart,
Miss
Keeldar.
In
the
winter
evenings
Tartar
lies
at
your
feet.
You
suffer
him
to
rest
his
head
on
your
perfumed
lap;
you
let
him
couch
on
the
borders
of
your
satin
raiment.
His
rough
hide
is
familiar
with
the
contact
of
your
hand.
I
once
saw
you
kiss
him
on
that
snow
white
beauty
spot
which
stars
his
broad
forehead.
It
is
dangerous
to
say
I
am
like
Tartar;
it
suggests
to
me
a
claim
to
be
treated
like
Tartar.'
"'Perhaps,
sir,
you
can
extort
as
much
from
your
penniless
and
friendless
young
orphan
girl,
when
you
find
her.'
"'Oh
could
I
find
her
such
as
I
image
her!
Something
to
tame
first,
and
teach
afterwards;
to
break
in,
and
then
to
fondle.
To
lift
the
destitute
proud
thing
out
of
poverty;
to
establish
power
over
and
then
to
be
indulgent
to
the
capricious
moods
that
never
were
influenced
and
never
indulged
before;
to
see
her
alternately
irritated
and
subdued
about
twelve
times
in
the
twenty
four
hours;
and
perhaps,
eventually,
when
her
training
was
accomplished,
to
behold
her
the
exemplary
and
patient
mother
of
about
a
dozen
children,
only
now
and
then
lending
little
Louis
a
cordial
cuff
by
way
of
paying
the
interest
of
the
vast
debt
she
owes
his
father.
Oh'
(I
went
on),
'my
orphan
girl
would
give
me
many
a
kiss;
she
would
watch
on
the
threshold
for
my
coming
home
of
an
evening;
she
would
run
into
my
arms;
she
would
keep
my
hearth
as
bright
as
she
would
make
it
warm.
God
bless
the
sweet
idea!
Find
her
I
must.'
"Her
eyes
emitted
an
eager
flash,
her
lips
opened;
but
she
reclosed
them,
and
impetuously
turned
away.
"'Tell
me,
tell
me
where
she
is,
Miss
Keeldar!'
"Another
movement,
all
haughtiness
and
fire
and
impulse.
"'I
must
know.
You
can
tell
me;
you
shall
tell
me.'
"'I
never
will.'
"She
turned
to
leave
me.
Could
I
now
let
her
part
as
she
had
always
parted
from
me?
No.
I
had
gone
too
far
not
to
finish;
I
had
come
too
near
the
end
not
to
drive
home
to
it.
All
the
encumbrance
of
doubt,
all
the
rubbish
of
indecision,
must
be
removed
at
once,
and
the
plain
truth
must
be
ascertained.
She
must
take
her
part,
and
tell
me
what
it
was;
I
must
take
mine
and
adhere
to
it.
"'A
minute,
madam,'
I
said,
keeping
my
hand
on
the
door
handle
before
I
opened
it.
'We
have
had
a
long
conversation
this
morning,
but
the
last
word
has
not
been
spoken
yet.
It
is
yours
to
speak
it.'
"'May
I
pass?'
"'No;
I
guard
the
door.
I
would
almost
rather
die
than
let
you
leave
me
just
now,
without
speaking
the
word
I
demand.'
"'What
dare
you
expect
me
to
say?'
"'What
I
am
dying
and
perishing
to
hear;
what
I
must
and
will
hear;
what
you
dare
not
now
suppress.'
"'Mr.
Moore,
I
hardly
know
what
you
mean.
You
are
not
like
yourself.'
"I
suppose
I
hardly
was
like
my
usual
self,
for
I
scared
her
that
I
could
see.
It
was
right:
she
must
be
scared
to
be
won.
"'You
do
know
what
I
mean,
and
for
the
first
time
I
stand
before
you
myself.
I
have
flung
off
the
tutor,
and
beg
to
introduce
you
to
the
man.
And
remember,
he
is
a
gentleman.'
"She
trembled.
She
put
her
hand
to
mine
as
if
to
remove
it
from
the
lock.
She
might
as
well
have
tried
to
loosen,
by
her
soft
touch,
metal
welded
to
metal.
She
felt
she
was
powerless,
and
receded;
and
again
she
trembled.
"What
change
I
underwent
I
cannot
explain,
but
out
of
her
emotion
passed
into
me
a
new
spirit.
I
neither
was
crushed
nor
elated
by
her
lands
and
gold;
I
thought
not
of
them,
cared
not
for
them.
They
were
nothing
dross
that
could
not
dismay
me.
I
saw
only
herself
her
young
beautiful
form,
the
grace,
the
majesty,
the
modesty
of
her
girlhood.
"'My
pupil,'
I
said.
"'My
master,'
was
the
low
answer.
"'I
have
a
thing
to
tell
you.'
"She
waited
with
declined
brow
and
ringlets
drooped.
"'I
have
to
tell
you
that
for
four
years
you
have
been
growing
into
your
tutor's
heart,
and
that
you
are
rooted
there
now.
I
have
to
declare
that
you
have
bewitched
me,
in
spite
of
sense,
and
experience,
and
difference
of
station
and
estate.
You
have
so
looked,
and
spoken,
and
moved;
so
shown
me
your
faults
and
your
virtues
beauties
rather,
they
are
hardly
so
stern
as
virtues
that
I
love
you
love
you
with
my
life
and
strength.
It
is
out
now.'
"She
sought
what
to
say,
but
could
not
find
a
word.
She
tried
to
rally,
but
vainly.
I
passionately
repeated
that
I
loved
her.
"'Well,
Mr.
Moore,
what
then?'
was
the
answer
I
got,
uttered
in
a
tone
that
would
have
been
petulant
if
it
had
not
faltered.
"'Have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me?
Have
you
no
love
for
me?'
"'A
little
bit.'
"'I
am
not
to
be
tortured.
I
will
not
even
play
at
present.'
"'I
don't
want
to
play;
I
want
to
go.'
"'I
wonder
you
dare
speak
of
going
at
this
moment.
You
go!
What!
with
my
heart
in
your
hand,
to
lay
it
on
your
toilet
and
pierce
it
with
your
pins?
From
my
presence
you
do
not
stir,
out
of
my
reach
you
do
not
stray,
till
I
receive
a
hostage
pledge
for
pledge
your
heart
for
mine.'
"'The
thing
you
want
is
mislaid
lost
some
time
since.
Let
me
go
and
seek
it.'
"'Declare
that
it
is
where
your
keys
often
are
in
my
possession.'
"'You
ought
to
know.
And
where
are
my
keys,
Mr.
Moore?
Indeed
and
truly
I
have
lost
them
again;
and
Mrs.
Gill
wants
some
money,
and
I
have
none,
except
this
sixpence.'
"She
took
the
coin
out
of
her
apron
pocket,
and
showed
it
in
her
palm.
I
could
have
trifled
with
her,
but
it
would
not
do;
life
and
death
were
at
stake.
Mastering
at
once
the
sixpence
and
the
hand
that
held
it,
I
demanded,
'Am
I
to
die
without
you,
or
am
I
to
live
for
you?'
"'Do
as
you
please.
Far
be
it
from
me
to
dictate
your
choice.'
"'You
shall
tell
me
with
your
own
lips
whether
you
doom
me
to
exile
or
call
me
to
hope.'
"'Go;
I
can
bear
to
be
left.'
"'Perhaps
I
too
can
bear
to
leave
you.
But
reply,
Shirley,
my
pupil,
my
sovereign
reply.'
"'Die
without
me
if
you
will;
live
for
me
if
you
dare.'
"'I
am
not
afraid
of
you,
my
leopardess.
I
dare
live
for
and
with
you,
from
this
hour
till
my
death.
Now,
then,
I
have
you.
You
are
mine.
I
will
never
let
you
go.
Wherever
my
home
be,
I
have
chosen
my
wife.
If
I
stay
in
England,
in
England
you
will
stay;
if
I
cross
the
Atlantic,
you
will
cross
it
also.
Our
lives
are
riveted,
our
lots
intertwined.'
"'And
are
we
equal,
then,
sir?
are
we
equal
at
last?'
"'You
are
younger,
frailer,
feebler,
more
ignorant
than
I.'
"'Will
you
be
good
to
me,
and
never
tyrannize?'
"'Will
you
let
me
breathe,
and
not
bewilder
me?
You
must
not
smile
at
present.
The
world
swims
and
changes
round
me.
The
sun
is
a
dizzying
scarlet
blaze,
the
sky
a
violet
vortex
whirling
over
me.'
"I
am
a
strong
man,
but
I
staggered
as
I
spoke.
All
creation
was
exaggerated.
Colour
grew
more
vivid,
motion
more
rapid,
life
itself
more
vital.
I
hardly
saw
her
for
a
moment,
but
I
heard
her
voice
pitilessly
sweet.
She
would
not
subdue
one
of
her
charms
in
compassion.
Perhaps
she
did
not
know
what
I
felt.
"'You
name
me
leopardess.
Remember,
the
leopardess
is
tameless,'
said
she.
"'Tame
or
fierce,
wild
or
subdued,
you
are
mine.'
"'I
am
glad
I
know
my
keeper
and
am
used
to
him.
Only
his
voice
will
I
follow;
only
his
hand
shall
manage
me;
only
at
his
feet
will
I
repose.'
"I
took
her
back
to
her
seat,
and
sat
down
by
her
side.
I
wanted
to
hear
her
speak
again.
I
could
never
have
enough
of
her
voice
and
her
words.
"'How
much
do
you
love
me?'
I
asked.
"'Ah!
you
know.
I
will
not
gratify
you
I
will
not
flatter.'
"'I
don't
know
half
enough;
my
heart
craves
to
be
fed.
If
you
knew
how
hungry
and
ferocious
it
is,
you
would
hasten
to
stay
it
with
a
kind
word
or
two.'
"'Poor
Tartar!'
said
she,
touching
and
patting
my
hand
'poor
fellow,
stalwart
friend,
Shirley's
pet
and
favourite,
lie
down!'
"'But
I
will
not
lie
down
till
I
am
fed
with
one
sweet
word.'
"And
at
last
she
gave
it.
"'Dear
Louis,
be
faithful
to
me;
never
leave
me.
I
don't
care
for
life
unless
I
may
pass
it
at
your
side.'
"'Something
more.'
"She
gave
me
a
change;
it
was
not
her
way
to
offer
the
same
dish
twice.
"'Sir,'
she
said,
starting
up,
'at
your
peril
you
ever
again
name
such
sordid
things
as
money,
or
poverty,
or
inequality.
It
will
be
absolutely
dangerous
to
torment
me
with
these
maddening
scruples.
I
defy
you
to
do
it.'
"My
face
grew
hot.
I
did
once
more
wish
I
were
not
so
poor
or
she
were
not
so
rich.
She
saw
the
transient
misery;
and
then,
indeed,
she
caressed
me.
Blent
with
torment,
I
experienced
rapture.
"'Mr.
Moore,'
said
she,
looking
up
with
a
sweet,
open,
earnest
countenance,
'teach
me
and
help
me
to
be
good.
I
do
not
ask
you
to
take
off
my
shoulders
all
the
cares
and
duties
of
property,
but
I
ask
you
to
share
the
burden,
and
to
show
me
how
to
sustain
my
part
well.
Your
judgment
is
well
balanced,
your
heart
is
kind,
your
principles
are
sound.
I
know
you
are
wise;
I
feel
you
are
benevolent;
I
believe
you
are
conscientious.
Be
my
companion
through
life;
be
my
guide
where
I
am
ignorant;
be
my
master
where
I
am
faulty;
be
my
friend
always!'
"'So
help
me
God,
I
will!'"
Yet
again
a
passage
from
the
blank
book
if
you
like,
reader;
if
you
don't
like
it,
pass
it
over:
"The
Sympsons
are
gone,
but
not
before
discovery
and
explanation.
My
manner
must
have
betrayed
something,
or
my
looks.
I
was
quiet,
but
I
forgot
to
be
guarded
sometimes.
I
stayed
longer
in
the
room
than
usual;
I
could
not
bear
to
be
out
of
her
presence;
I
returned
to
it,
and
basked
in
it,
like
Tartar
in
the
sun.
If
she
left
the
oak
parlour,
instinctively
I
rose
and
left
it
too.
She
chid
me
for
this
procedure
more
than
once.
I
did
it
with
a
vague,
blundering
idea
of
getting
a
word
with
her
in
the
hall
or
elsewhere.
Yesterday
towards
dusk
I
had
her
to
myself
for
five
minutes
by
the
hall
fire.
We
stood
side
by
side;
she
was
railing
at
me,
and
I
was
enjoying
the
sound
of
her
voice.
The
young
ladies
passed,
and
looked
at
us;
we
did
not
separate.
Ere
long
they
repassed,
and
again
looked.
Mrs.
Sympson
came;
we
did
not
move.
Mr.
Sympson
opened
the
dining
room
door.
Shirley
flashed
him
back
full
payment
for
his
spying
gaze.
She
curled
her
lip
and
tossed
her
tresses.
The
glance
she
gave
was
at
once
explanatory
and
defiant.
It
said:
'I
like
Mr.
Moore's
society,
and
I
dare
you
to
find
fault
with
my
taste.'
"I
asked,
'Do
you
mean
him
to
understand
how
matters
are?'
"'I
do,'
said
she;
'but
I
leave
the
development
to
chance.
There
will
be
a
scene.
I
neither
invite
it
nor
fear
it;
only,
you
must
be
present,
for
I
am
inexpressibly
tired
of
facing
him
solus.
I
don't
like
to
see
him
in
a
rage.
He
then
puts
off
all
his
fine
proprieties
and
conventional
disguises,
and
the
real
human
being
below
is
what
you
would
call
commun,
plat,
bas
vilain
et
un
peu
mechant.
His
ideas
are
not
clean,
Mr.
Moore;
they
want
scouring
with
soft
soap
and
fuller's
earth.
I
think,
if
he
could
add
his
imagination
to
the
contents
of
Mrs.
Gill's
bucking
basket,
and
let
her
boil
it
in
her
copper,
with
rain
water
and
bleaching
powder
(I
hope
you
think
me
a
tolerable
laundress),
it
would
do
him
incalculable
good.'
"This
morning,
fancying
I
heard
her
descend
somewhat
early,
I
was
down
instantly.
I
had
not
been
deceived.
There
she
was,
busy
at
work
in
the
breakfast
parlour,
of
which
the
housemaid
was
completing
the
arrangement
and
dusting.
She
had
risen
betimes
to
finish
some
little
keepsake
she
intended
for
Henry.
I
got
only
a
cool
reception,
which
I
accepted
till
the
girl
was
gone,
taking
my
book
to
the
window
seat
very
quietly.
Even
when
we
were
alone
I
was
slow
to
disturb
her.
To
sit
with
her
in
sight
was
happiness,
and
the
proper
happiness,
for
early
morning
serene,
incomplete,
but
progressive.
Had
I
been
obtrusive,
I
knew
I
should
have
encountered
rebuff.
'Not
at
home
to
suitors'
was
written
on
her
brow.
Therefore
I
read
on,
stole
now
and
then
a
look,
watched
her
countenance
soften
and
open
as
she
felt
I
respected
her
mood,
and
enjoyed
the
gentle
content
of
the
moment.
"The
distance
between
us
shrank,
and
the
light
hoar
frost
thawed
insensibly.
Ere
an
hour
elapsed
I
was
at
her
side,
watching
her
sew,
gathering
her
sweet
smiles
and
her
merry
words,
which
fell
for
me
abundantly.
We
sat,
as
we
had
a
right
to
sit,
side
by
side;
my
arm
rested
on
her
chair;
I
was
near
enough
to
count
the
stitches
of
her
work,
and
to
discern
the
eye
of
her
needle.
The
door
suddenly
opened.
"I
believe,
if
I
had
just
then
started
from
her,
she
would
have
despised
me.
Thanks
to
the
phlegm
of
my
nature,
I
rarely
start.
When
I
am
well
off,
bien,
comfortable,
I
am
not
soon
stirred.
Bien
I
was
tres
bien
consequently
immutable.
No
muscle
moved.
I
hardly
looked
to
the
door.
"'Good
morning,
uncle,'
said
she,
addressing
that
personage,
who
paused
on
the
threshold
in
a
state
of
petrifaction.
"'Have
you
been
long
downstairs,
Miss
Keeldar,
and
alone
with
Mr.
Moore?'
"'Yes,
a
very
long
time.
We
both
came
down
early;
it
was
scarcely
light.'
"'The
proceeding
is
improper
'
"'It
was
at
first,
I
was
rather
cross,
and
not
civil;
but
you
will
perceive
that
we
are
now
friends.'
"'I
perceive
more
than
you
would
wish
me
to
perceive.'
"'Hardly,
sir,'
said
I;
'we
have
no
disguises.
Will
you
permit
me
to
intimate
that
any
further
observations
you
have
to
make
may
as
well
be
addressed
to
me?
Henceforward
I
stand
between
Miss
Keeldar
and
all
annoyance.'
"'You!
What
have
you
to
do
with
Miss
Keeldar?'
"'To
protect,
watch
over,
serve
her.'
"'You,
sir
you,
the
tutor?'
"'Not
one
word
of
insult,
sir,'
interposed
she;
'not
one
syllable
of
disrespect
to
Mr.
Moore
in
this
house.'
"'Do
you
take
his
part?'
"'His
part?
oh
yes!'
"She
turned
to
me
with
a
sudden
fond
movement,
which
I
met
by
circling
her
with
my
arm.
She
and
I
both
rose.
"'Good
Ged!'
was
the
cry
from
the
morning
gown
standing
quivering
at
the
door.
Ged,
I
think,
must
be
the
cognomen
of
Mr.
Sympson's
Lares.
When
hard
pressed
he
always
invokes
this
idol.
"'Come
forward,
uncle;
you
shall
hear
all.
Tell
him
all,
Louis.'
"'I
dare
him
to
speak
the
beggar!
the
knave!
the
specious
hypocrite!
the
vile,
insinuating,
infamous
menial!
Stand
apart
from
my
niece,
sir.
Let
her
go!'
"She
clung
to
me
with
energy.
'I
am
near
my
future
husband,'
she
said.
'Who
dares
touch
him
or
me?'
"'Her
husband!'
He
raised
and
spread
his
hands.
He
dropped
into
a
seat.
"'A
while
ago
you
wanted
much
to
know
whom
I
meant
to
marry.
My
intention
was
then
formed,
but
not
mature
for
communication.
Now
it
is
ripe,
sun
mellowed,
perfect.
Take
the
crimson
peach
take
Louis
Moore!'
"'But'
(savagely)
'you
shall
not
have
him;
he
shall
not
have
you.'
"'I
would
die
before
I
would
have
another.
I
would
die
if
I
might
not
have
him.'
"He
uttered
words
with
which
this
page
shall
never
be
polluted.
"She
turned
white
as
death;
she
shook
all
over;
she
lost
her
strength.
I
laid
her
down
on
the
sofa;
just
looked
to
ascertain
that
she
had
not
fainted
of
which,
with
a
divine
smile,
she
assured
me.
I
kissed
her;
and
then,
if
I
were
to
perish,
I
cannot
give
a
clear
account
of
what
happened
in
the
course
of
the
next
five
minutes.
She
has
since
through
tears,
laughter,
and
trembling
told
me
that
I
turned
terrible,
and
gave
myself
to
the
demon.
She
says
I
left
her,
made
one
bound
across
the
room;
that
Mr.
Sympson
vanished
through
the
door
as
if
shot
from
a
cannon.
I
also
vanished,
and
she
heard
Mrs.
Gill
scream.
"Mrs.
Gill
was
still
screaming
when
I
came
to
my
senses.
I
was
then
in
another
apartment
the
oak
parlour,
I
think.
I
held
Sympson
before
me
crushed
into
a
chair,
and
my
hand
was
on
his
cravat.
His
eyes
rolled
in
his
head;
I
was
strangling
him,
I
think.
The
housekeeper
stood
wringing
her
hands,
entreating
me
to
desist.
I
desisted
that
moment,
and
felt
at
once
as
cool
as
stone.
But
I
told
Mrs.
Gill
to
fetch
the
Red
House
Inn
chaise
instantly,
and
informed
Mr.
Sympson
he
must
depart
from
Fieldhead
the
instant
it
came.
Though
half
frightened
out
of
his
wits,
he
declared
he
would
not.
Repeating
the
former
order,
I
added
a
commission
to
fetch
a
constable.
I
said,
'You
shall
go,
by
fair
means
or
foul.'
"He
threatened
prosecution;
I
cared
for
nothing.
I
had
stood
over
him
once
before,
not
quite
so
fiercely
as
now,
but
full
as
austerely.
It
was
one
night
when
burglars
attempted
the
house
at
Sympson
Grove,
and
in
his
wretched
cowardice
he
would
have
given
a
vain
alarm,
without
daring
to
offer
defence.
I
had
then
been
obliged
to
protect
his
family
and
his
abode
by
mastering
himself
and
I
had
succeeded.
I
now
remained
with
him
till
the
chaise
came.
I
marshalled
him
to
it,
he
scolding
all
the
way.
He
was
terribly
bewildered,
as
well
as
enraged.
He
would
have
resisted
me,
but
knew
not
how.
He
called
for
his
wife
and
daughters
to
come.
I
said
they
should
follow
him
as
soon
as
they
could
prepare.
The
smoke,
the
fume,
the
fret
of
his
demeanour
was
inexpressible,
but
it
was
a
fury
incapable
of
producing
a
deed.
That
man,
properly
handled,
must
ever
remain
impotent.
I
know
he
will
never
touch
me
with
the
law.
I
know
his
wife,
over
whom
he
tyrannizes
in
trifles,
guides
him
in
matters
of
importance.
I
have
long
since
earned
her
undying
mother's
gratitude
by
my
devotion
to
her
boy.
In
some
of
Henry's
ailments
I
have
nursed
him
better,
she
said,
than
any
woman
could
nurse.
She
will
never
forget
that.
She
and
her
daughters
quitted
me
to
day,
in
mute
wrath
and
consternation;
but
she
respects
me.
When
Henry
clung
to
my
neck
as
I
lifted
him
into
the
carriage
and
placed
him
by
her
side,
when
I
arranged
her
own
wrapping
to
make
her
warm,
though
she
turned
her
head
from
me,
I
saw
the
tears
start
to
her
eyes.
She
will
but
the
more
zealously
advocate
my
cause
because
she
has
left
me
in
anger.
I
am
glad
of
this
not
for
my
own
sake,
but
for
that
of
my
life
and
idol
my
Shirley."
Once
again
he
writes,
a
week
after:
"I
am
now
at
Stilbro'.
I
have
taken
up
my
temporary
abode
with
a
friend
a
professional
man,
in
whose
business
I
can
be
useful.
Every
day
I
ride
over
to
Fieldhead.
How
long
will
it
be
before
I
can
call
that
place
my
home,
and
its
mistress
mine?
I
am
not
easy,
not
tranquil;
I
am
tantalized,
sometimes
tortured.
To
see
her
now,
one
would
think
she
had
never
pressed
her
cheek
to
my
shoulder,
or
clung
to
me
with
tenderness
or
trust.
I
feel
unsafe;
she
renders
me
miserable.
I
am
shunned
when
I
visit
her;
she
withdraws
from
my
reach.
Once
this
day
I
lifted
her
face,
resolved
to
get
a
full
look
down
her
deep,
dark
eyes.
Difficult
to
describe
what
I
read
there!
Pantheress!
beautiful
forest
born!
wily,
tameless,
peerless
nature!
She
gnaws
her
chain;
I
see
the
white
teeth
working
at
the
steel!
She
has
dreams
of
her
wild
woods
and
pinings
after
virgin
freedom.
I
wish
Sympson
would
come
again,
and
oblige
her
again
to
entwine
her
arms
about
me.
I
wish
there
was
danger
she
should
lose
me,
as
there
is
risk
I
shall
lose
her.
No;
final
loss
I
do
not
fear,
but
long
delay
"It
is
now
night
midnight.
I
have
spent
the
afternoon
and
evening
at
Fieldhead.
Some
hours
ago
she
passed
me,
coming
down
the
oak
staircase
to
the
hall.
She
did
not
know
I
was
standing
in
the
twilight,
near
the
staircase
window,
looking
at
the
frost
bright
constellations.
How
closely
she
glided
against
the
banisters!
How
shyly
shone
her
large
eyes
upon
me!
How
evanescent,
fugitive,
fitful
she
looked
slim
and
swift
as
a
northern
streamer!
"I
followed
her
into
the
drawing
room.
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Caroline
Helstone
were
both
there;
she
has
summoned
them
to
bear
her
company
awhile.
In
her
white
evening
dress,
with
her
long
hair
flowing
full
and
wavy,
with
her
noiseless
step,
her
pale
cheek,
her
eye
full
of
night
and
lightning,
she
looked,
I
thought,
spirit
like
a
thing
made
of
an
element,
the
child
of
a
breeze
and
a
flame,
the
daughter
of
ray
and
raindrop
a
thing
never
to
be
overtaken,
arrested,
fixed.
I
wished
I
could
avoid
following
her
with
my
gaze
as
she
moved
here
and
there,
but
it
was
impossible.
I
talked
with
the
other
ladies
as
well
as
I
could,
but
still
I
looked
at
her.
She
was
very
silent;
I
think
she
never
spoke
to
me
not
even
when
she
offered
me
tea.
It
happened
that
she
was
called
out
a
minute
by
Mrs.
Gill.
I
passed
into
the
moonlit
hall,
with
the
design
of
getting
a
word
as
she
returned;
nor
in
this
did
I
fail.
"'Miss
Keeldar,
stay
one
instant,'
said
I,
meeting
her.
"'Why?
the
hall
is
too
cold.'
"'It
is
not
cold
for
me;
at
my
side
it
should
not
be
cold
for
you.'
"'But
I
shiver.'
"'With
fear,
I
believe.
What
makes
you
fear
me?
You
are
quiet
and
distant.
Why?'
"'I
may
well
fear
what
looks
like
a
great
dark
goblin
meeting
me
in
the
moonlight.'
"'Do
not
do
not
pass!
Stay
with
me
awhile.
Let
us
exchange
a
few
quiet
words.
It
is
three
days
since
I
spoke
to
you
alone.
Such
changes
are
cruel.'
"'I
have
no
wish
to
be
cruel,'
she
responded,
softly
enough.
Indeed
there
was
softness
in
her
whole
deportment
in
her
face,
in
her
voice;
but
there
was
also
reserve,
and
an
air
fleeting,
evanishing,
intangible.
"'You
certainly
give
me
pain,'
said
I.
'It
is
hardly
a
week
since
you
called
me
your
future
husband
and
treated
me
as
such.
Now
I
am
once
more
the
tutor
for
you.
I
am
addressed
as
Mr.
Moore
and
sir.
Your
lips
have
forgotten
Louis.'
"'No,
Louis,
no.
It
is
an
easy,
liquid
name
not
soon
forgotten.'
"'Be
cordial
to
Louis,
then;
approach
him
let
him
approach.'
"'I
am
cordial,'
said
she,
hovering
aloof
like
a
white
shadow.
"'Your
voice
is
very
sweet
and
very
low,'
I
answered,
quietly
advancing.
'You
seem
subdued,
but
still
startled.'
"'No
quite
calm,
and
afraid
of
nothing,'
she
assured
me.
"'Of
nothing
but
your
votary.'
"I
bent
a
knee
to
the
flags
at
her
feet.
"'You
see
I
am
in
a
new
world,
Mr.
Moore.
I
don't
know
myself;
I
don't
know
you.
But
rise.
When
you
do
so
I
feel
troubled
and
disturbed.'
"I
obeyed.
It
would
not
have
suited
me
to
retain
that
attitude
long.
I
courted
serenity
and
confidence
for
her,
and
not
vainly.
She
trusted
and
clung
to
me
again.
"'Now,
Shirley,'
I
said,
'you
can
conceive
I
am
far
from
happy
in
my
present
uncertain,
unsettled
state.'
"'Oh
yes,
you
are
happy!'
she
cried
hastily.
'You
don't
know
how
happy
you
are.
Any
change
will
be
for
the
worse.'
"'Happy
or
not,
I
cannot
bear
to
go
on
so
much
longer.
You
are
too
generous
to
require
it.'
"'Be
reasonable,
Louis;
be
patient!
I
like
you
because
you
are
patient.'
"'Like
me
no
longer,
then;
love
me
instead.
Fix
our
marriage
day;
think
of
it
to
night,
and
decide.'
"She
breathed
a
murmur,
inarticulate
yet
expressive;
darted,
or
melted,
from
my
arms
and
I
lost
her."
Yes,
reader,
we
must
settle
accounts
now.
I
have
only
briefly
to
narrate
the
final
fates
of
some
of
the
personages
whose
acquaintance
we
have
made
in
this
narrative,
and
then
you
and
I
must
shake
hands,
and
for
the
present
separate.
Let
us
turn
to
the
curates
to
the
much
loved,
though
long
neglected.
Come
forward,
modest
merit!
Malone,
I
see,
promptly
answers
the
invocation.
He
knows
his
own
description
when
he
hears
it.
No,
Peter
Augustus;
we
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
you.
It
won't
do.
Impossible
to
trust
ourselves
with
the
touching
tale
of
your
deeds
and
destinies.
Are
you
not
aware,
Peter,
that
a
discriminating
public
has
its
crotchets;
that
the
unvarnished
truth
does
not
answer;
that
plain
facts
will
not
digest?
Do
you
not
know
that
the
squeak
of
the
real
pig
is
no
more
relished
now
than
it
was
in
days
of
yore?
Were
I
to
give
the
catastrophe
of
your
life
and
conversation,
the
public
would
sweep
off
in
shrieking
hysterics,
and
there
would
be
a
wild
cry
for
sal
volatile
and
burnt
feathers.
"Impossible!"
would
be
pronounced
here;
"untrue!"
would
be
responded
there;
"inartistic!"
would
be
solemnly
decided.
Note
well.
Whenever
you
present
the
actual,
simple
truth,
it
is,
somehow,
always
denounced
as
a
lie
they
disown
it,
cast
it
off,
throw
it
on
the
parish;
whereas
the
product
of
your
own
imagination,
the
mere
figment,
the
sheer
fiction,
is
adopted,
petted,
termed
pretty,
proper,
sweetly
natural
the
little,
spurious
wretch
gets
all
the
comfits,
the
honest,
lawful
bantling
all
the
cuffs.
Such
is
the
way
of
the
world,
Peter;
and
as
you
are
the
legitimate
urchin,
rude,
unwashed,
and
naughty,
you
must
stand
down.
Make
way
for
Mr.
Sweeting.
Here
he
comes,
with
his
lady
on
his
arm
the
most
splendid
and
the
weightiest
woman
in
Yorkshire
Mrs.
Sweeting,
formerly
Miss
Dora
Sykes.
They
were
married
under
the
happiest
auspices,
Mr.
Sweeting
having
been
just
inducted
to
a
comfortable
living,
and
Mr.
Sykes
being
in
circumstances
to
give
Dora
a
handsome
portion.
They
lived
long
and
happily
together,
beloved
by
their
parishioners
and
by
a
numerous
circle
of
friends.
There!
I
think
the
varnish
has
been
put
on
very
nicely.
Advance,
Mr.
Donne.
This
gentleman
turned
out
admirably
far
better
than
either
you
or
I
could
possibly
have
expected,
reader.
He,
too,
married
a
most
sensible,
quiet,
lady
like
little
woman.
The
match
was
the
making
of
him.
He
became
an
exemplary
domestic
character,
and
a
truly
active
parish
priest
(as
a
pastor
he,
to
his
dying
day,
conscientiously
refused
to
act).
The
outside
of
the
cup
and
platter
he
burnished
up
with
the
best
polishing
powder;
the
furniture
of
the
altar
and
temple
he
looked
after
with
the
zeal
of
an
upholsterer,
the
care
of
a
cabinet
maker.
His
little
school,
his
little
church,
his
little
parsonage,
all
owed
their
erection
to
him;
and
they
did
him
credit.
Each
was
a
model
in
its
way.
If
uniformity
and
taste
in
architecture
had
been
the
same
thing
as
consistency
and
earnestness
in
religion,
what
a
shepherd
of
a
Christian
flock
Mr.
Donne
would
have
made!
There
was
one
art
in
the
mastery
of
which
nothing
mortal
ever
surpassed
Mr.
Donne:
it
was
that
of
begging.
By
his
own
unassisted
efforts
he
begged
all
the
money
for
all
his
erections.
In
this
matter
he
had
a
grasp
of
plan,
a
scope
of
action
quite
unique.
He
begged
of
high
and
low
of
the
shoeless
cottage
brat
and
the
coroneted
duke.
He
sent
out
begging
letters
far
and
wide
to
old
Queen
Charlotte,
to
the
princesses
her
daughters,
to
her
sons
the
royal
dukes,
to
the
Prince
Regent,
to
Lord
Castlereagh,
to
every
member
of
the
ministry
then
in
office;
and,
what
is
more
remarkable,
he
screwed
something
out
of
every
one
of
these
personages.
It
is
on
record
that
he
got
five
pounds
from
the
close
fisted
old
lady
Queen
Charlotte,
and
two
guineas
from
the
royal
profligate
her
eldest
son.
When
Mr.
Donne
set
out
on
begging
expeditions,
he
armed
himself
in
a
complete
suit
of
brazen
mail.
That
you
had
given
a
hundred
pounds
yesterday
was
with
him
no
reason
why
you
should
not
give
two
hundred
to
day.
He
would
tell
you
so
to
your
face,
and,
ten
to
one,
get
the
money
out
of
you.
People
gave
to
get
rid
of
him.
After
all,
he
did
some
good
with
the
cash.
He
was
useful
in
his
day
and
generation.
Perhaps
I
ought
to
remark
that
on
the
premature
and
sudden
vanishing
of
Mr.
Malone
from
the
stage
of
Briarfield
parish
(you
cannot
know
how
it
happened,
reader;
your
curiosity
must
be
robbed
to
pay
your
elegant
love
of
the
pretty
and
pleasing),
there
came
as
his
successor
another
Irish
curate,
Mr.
Macarthey.
I
am
happy
to
be
able
to
inform
you,
with
truth,
that
this
gentleman
did
as
much
credit
to
his
country
as
Malone
had
done
it
discredit.
He
proved
himself
as
decent,
decorous,
and
conscientious
as
Peter
was
rampant,
boisterous,
and
This
last
epithet
I
choose
to
suppress,
because
it
would
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag.
He
laboured
faithfully
in
the
parish.
The
schools,
both
Sunday
and
day
schools,
flourished
under
his
sway
like
green
bay
trees.
Being
human,
of
course
he
had
his
faults.
These,
however,
were
proper,
steady
going,
clerical
faults
what
many
would
call
virtues.
The
circumstance
of
finding
himself
invited
to
tea
with
a
Dissenter
would
unhinge
him
for
a
week.
The
spectacle
of
a
Quaker
wearing
his
hat
in
the
church,
the
thought
of
an
unbaptized
fellow
creature
being
interred
with
Christian
rites
these
things
could
make
strange
havoc
in
Mr.
Macarthey's
physical
and
mental
economy.
Otherwise
he
was
sane
and
rational,
diligent
and
charitable.
I
doubt
not
a
justice
loving
public
will
have
remarked,
ere
this,
that
I
have
thus
far
shown
a
criminal
remissness
in
pursuing,
catching,
and
bringing
to
condign
punishment
the
would
be
assassin
of
Mr.
Robert
Moore.
Here
was
a
fine
opening
to
lead
my
willing
readers
a
dance,
at
once
decorous
and
exciting
a
dance
of
law
and
gospel,
of
the
dungeon,
the
dock,
and
the
"dead
thraw."
You
might
have
liked
it,
reader,
but
I
should
not.
I
and
my
subject
would
presently
have
quarrelled,
and
then
I
should
have
broken
down.
I
was
happy
to
find
that
facts
perfectly
exonerated
me
from
the
attempt.
The
murderer
was
never
punished,
for
the
good
reason
that
he
was
never
caught
the
result
of
the
further
circumstance
that
he
was
never
pursued.
The
magistrates
made
a
shuffling,
as
if
they
were
going
to
rise
and
do
valiant
things;
but
since
Moore
himself,
instead
of
urging
and
leading
them
as
heretofore,
lay
still
on
his
little
cottage
couch,
laughing
in
his
sleeve,
and
sneering
with
every
feature
of
his
pale,
foreign
face,
they
considered
better
of
it,
and
after
fulfilling
certain
indispensable
forms,
prudently
resolved
to
let
the
matter
quietly
drop,
which
they
did.
Mr.
Moore
knew
who
had
shot
him,
and
all
Briarfield
knew.
It
was
no
other
than
Michael
Hartley,
the
half
crazed
weaver
once
before
alluded
to,
a
frantic
Antinomian
in
religion,
and
a
mad
leveller
in
politics.
The
poor
soul
died
of
delirium
tremens
a
year
after
the
attempt
on
Moore,
and
Robert
gave
his
wretched
widow
a
guinea
to
bury
him.
The
winter
is
over
and
gone;
spring
has
followed
with
beamy
and
shadowy,
with
flowery
and
showery
flight.
We
are
now
in
the
heart
of
summer
in
mid
June
the
June
of
1812.
It
is
burning
weather.
The
air
is
deep
azure
and
red
gold.
It
fits
the
time;
it
fits
the
age;
it
fits
the
present
spirit
of
the
nations.
The
nineteenth
century
wantons
in
its
giant
adolescence;
the
Titan
boy
uproots
mountains
in
his
game,
and
hurls
rocks
in
his
wild
sport.
This
summer
Bonaparte
is
in
the
saddle;
he
and
his
host
scour
Russian
deserts.
He
has
with
him
Frenchmen
and
Poles,
Italians
and
children
of
the
Rhine,
six
hundred
thousand
strong.
He
marches
on
old
Moscow.
Under
old
Moscow's
walls
the
rude
Cossack
waits
him.
Barbarian
stoic!
he
waits
without
fear
of
the
boundless
ruin
rolling
on.
He
puts
his
trust
in
a
snow
cloud;
the
wilderness,
the
wind,
and
the
hail
storm
are
his
refuge;
his
allies
are
the
elements
air,
fire,
water.
And
what
are
these?
Three
terrible
archangels
ever
stationed
before
the
throne
of
Jehovah.
They
stand
clothed
in
white,
girdled
with
golden
girdles;
they
uplift
vials,
brimming
with
the
wrath
of
God.
Their
time
is
the
day
of
vengeance;
their
signal,
the
word
of
the
Lord
of
hosts,
"thundering
with
the
voice
of
His
excellency."
"Hast
thou
entered
into
the
treasures
of
the
snow?
or
hast
thou
seen
the
treasures
of
the
hail,
which
I
have
reserved
against
the
time
of
trouble,
against
the
day
of
battle
and
war?
"Go
your
ways.
Pour
out
the
vials
of
the
wrath
of
God
upon
the
earth."
It
is
done.
The
earth
is
scorched
with
fire;
the
sea
becomes
"as
the
blood
of
a
dead
man;"
the
islands
flee
away;
the
mountains
are
not
found.
In
this
year,
Lord
Wellington
assumed
the
reins
in
Spain.
They
made
him
generalissimo,
for
their
own
salvation's
sake.
In
this
year
he
took
Badajos,
he
fought
the
field
of
Vittoria,
he
captured
Pampeluna,
he
stormed
San
Sebastian;
in
this
year
he
won
Salamanca.
Men
of
Manchester,
I
beg
your
pardon
for
this
slight
resume
of
warlike
facts,
but
it
is
of
no
consequence.
Lord
Wellington
is,
for
you,
only
a
decayed
old
gentleman
now.
I
rather
think
some
of
you
have
called
him
a
"dotard;"
you
have
taunted
him
with
his
age
and
the
loss
of
his
physical
vigour.
What
fine
heroes
you
are
yourselves!
Men
like
you
have
a
right
to
trample
on
what
is
mortal
in
a
demigod.
Scoff
at
your
ease;
your
scorn
can
never
break
his
grand
old
heart.
But
come,
friends,
whether
Quakers
or
cotton
printers,
let
us
hold
a
peace
congress,
and
let
out
our
venom
quietly.
We
have
been
talking
with
unseemly
zeal
about
bloody
battles
and
butchering
generals;
we
arrive
now
at
a
triumph
in
your
line.
On
the
18th
of
June
1812
the
Orders
in
Council
were
repealed,
and
the
blockaded
ports
thrown
open.
You
know
very
well
such
of
you
as
are
old
enough
to
remember
you
made
Yorkshire
and
Lancashire
shake
with
your
shout
on
that
occasion.
The
ringers
cracked
a
bell
in
Briarfield
belfry;
it
is
dissonant
to
this
day.
The
Association
of
Merchants
and
Manufacturers
dined
together
at
Stilbro',
and
one
and
all
went
home
in
such
a
plight
as
their
wives
would
never
wish
to
witness
more.
Liverpool
started
and
snorted
like
a
river
horse
roused
amongst
his
reeds
by
thunder.
Some
of
the
American
merchants
felt
threatenings
of
apoplexy,
and
had
themselves
bled
all,
like
wise
men,
at
this
first
moment
of
prosperity,
prepared
to
rush
into
the
bowels
of
speculation,
and
to
delve
new
difficulties,
in
whose
depths
they
might
lose
themselves
at
some
future
day.
Stocks
which
had
been
accumulating
for
years
now
went
off
in
a
moment,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye.
Warehouses
were
lightened,
ships
were
laden;
work
abounded,
wages
rose;
the
good
time
seemed
come.
These
prospects
might
be
delusive,
but
they
were
brilliant
to
some
they
were
even
true.
At
that
epoch,
in
that
single
month
of
June,
many
a
solid
fortune
was
realized.
When
a
whole
province
rejoices,
the
humblest
of
its
inhabitants
tastes
a
festal
feeling;
the
sound
of
public
bells
rouses
the
most
secluded
abode,
as
if
with
a
call
to
be
gay.
And
so
Caroline
Helstone
thought,
when
she
dressed
herself
more
carefully
than
usual
on
the
day
of
this
trading
triumph,
and
went,
attired
in
her
neatest
muslin,
to
spend
the
afternoon
at
Fieldhead,
there
to
superintend
certain
millinery
preparations
for
a
great
event,
the
last
appeal
in
these
matters
being
reserved
for
her
unimpeachable
taste.
She
decided
on
the
wreath,
the
veil,
the
dress
to
be
worn
at
the
altar.
She
chose
various
robes
and
fashions
for
more
ordinary
occasions,
without
much
reference
to
the
bride's
opinion
that
lady,
indeed,
being
in
a
somewhat
impracticable
mood.
Louis
had
presaged
difficulties,
and
he
had
found
them
in
fact,
his
mistress
had
shown
herself
exquisitely
provoking,
putting
off
her
marriage
day
by
day,
week
by
week,
month
by
month,
at
first
coaxing
him
with
soft
pretences
of
procrastination,
and
in
the
end
rousing
his
whole
deliberate
but
determined
nature
to
revolt
against
her
tyranny,
at
once
so
sweet
and
so
intolerable.
It
had
needed
a
sort
of
tempest
shock
to
bring
her
to
the
point;
but
there
she
was
at
last,
fettered
to
a
fixed
day.
There
she
lay,
conquered
by
love,
and
bound
with
a
vow.
Thus
vanquished
and
restricted,
she
pined,
like
any
other
chained
denizen
of
deserts.
Her
captor
alone
could
cheer
her;
his
society
only
could
make
amends
for
the
lost
privilege
of
liberty.
In
his
absence
she
sat
or
wandered
alone,
spoke
little,
and
ate
less.
She
furthered
no
preparations
for
her
nuptials;
Louis
was
himself
obliged
to
direct
all
arrangements.
He
was
virtually
master
of
Fieldhead
weeks
before
he
became
so
nominally
the
least
presumptuous,
the
kindest
master
that
ever
was,
but
with
his
lady
absolute.
She
abdicated
without
a
word
or
a
struggle.
"Go
to
Mr.
Moore,
ask
Mr.
Moore,"
was
her
answer
when
applied
to
for
orders.
Never
was
wooer
of
wealthy
bride
so
thoroughly
absolved
from
the
subaltern
part,
so
inevitably
compelled
to
assume
a
paramount
character.
In
all
this
Miss
Keeldar
partly
yielded
to
her
disposition;
but
a
remark
she
made
a
year
afterwards
proved
that
she
partly
also
acted
on
system.
"Louis,"
she
said,
"would
never
have
learned
to
rule
if
she
had
not
ceased
to
govern.
The
incapacity
of
the
sovereign
had
developed
the
powers
of
the
premier."
It
had
been
intended
that
Miss
Helstone
should
act
as
bridesmaid
at
the
approaching
nuptials,
but
Fortune
had
destined
her
another
part.
She
came
home
in
time
to
water
her
plants.
She
had
performed
this
little
task.
The
last
flower
attended
to
was
a
rose
tree,
which
bloomed
in
a
quiet
green
nook
at
the
back
of
the
house.
This
plant
had
received
the
refreshing
shower;
she
was
now
resting
a
minute.
Near
the
wall
stood
a
fragment
of
sculptured
stone
a
monkish
relic
once,
perhaps,
the
base
of
a
cross.
She
mounted
it,
that
she
might
better
command
the
view.
She
had
still
the
watering
pot
in
one
hand;
with
the
other
her
pretty
dress
was
held
lightly
aside,
to
avoid
trickling
drops.
She
gazed
over
the
wall,
along
some
lonely
fields;
beyond
three
dusk
trees,
rising
side
by
side
against
the
sky;
beyond
a
solitary
thorn
at
the
head
of
a
solitary
lane
far
off.
She
surveyed
the
dusk
moors,
where
bonfires
were
kindling.
The
summer
evening
was
warm;
the
bell
music
was
joyous;
the
blue
smoke
of
the
fires
looked
soft,
their
red
flame
bright.
Above
them,
in
the
sky
whence
the
sun
had
vanished,
twinkled
a
silver
point
the
star
of
love.
Caroline
was
not
unhappy
that
evening
far
otherwise;
but
as
she
gazed
she
sighed,
and
as
she
sighed
a
hand
circled
her,
and
rested
quietly
on
her
waist.
Caroline
thought
she
knew
who
had
drawn
near;
she
received
the
touch
unstartled.
"I
am
looking
at
Venus,
mamma.
See,
she
is
beautiful.
How
white
her
lustre
is,
compared
with
the
deep
red
of
the
bonfires!"
The
answer
was
a
closer
caress;
and
Caroline
turned,
and
looked,
not
into
Mrs.
Pryor's
matron
face,
but
up
at
a
dark
manly
visage.
She
dropped
her
watering
pot
and
stepped
down
from
the
pedestal.
"I
have
been
sitting
with
'mamma'
an
hour,"
said
the
intruder.
"I
have
had
a
long
conversation
with
her.
Where,
meantime,
have
you
been?"
"To
Fieldhead.
Shirley
is
as
naughty
as
ever,
Robert.
She
will
neither
say
Yes
nor
No
to
any
question
put.
She
sits
alone.
I
cannot
tell
whether
she
is
melancholy
or
nonchalant.
If
you
rouse
her
or
scold
her,
she
gives
you
a
look,
half
wistful,
half
reckless,
which
sends
you
away
as
queer
and
crazed
as
herself.
What
Louis
will
make
of
her,
I
cannot
tell.
For
my
part,
if
I
were
a
gentleman,
I
think
I
would
not
dare
undertake
her."
"Never
mind
them.
They
were
cut
out
for
each
other.
Louis,
strange
to
say,
likes
her
all
the
better
for
these
freaks.
He
will
manage
her,
if
any
one
can.
She
tries
him,
however.
He
has
had
a
stormy
courtship
for
such
a
calm
character;
but
you
see
it
all
ends
in
victory
for
him.
Caroline,
I
have
sought
you
to
ask
an
audience.
Why
are
those
bells
ringing?"
"For
the
repeal
of
your
terrible
law
the
Orders
you
hate
so
much.
You
are
pleased,
are
you
not?"
"Yesterday
evening
at
this
time
I
was
packing
some
books
for
a
sea
voyage.
They
were
the
only
possessions,
except
some
clothes,
seeds,
roots,
and
tools,
which
I
felt
free
to
take
with
me
to
Canada.
I
was
going
to
leave
you."
"To
leave
me?
To
leave
me?"
Her
little
fingers
fastened
on
his
arm;
she
spoke
and
looked
affrighted.
"Not
now
not
now.
Examine
my
face
yes,
look
at
me
well.
Is
the
despair
of
parting
legible
thereon?"
She
looked
into
an
illuminated
countenance,
whose
characters
were
all
beaming,
though
the
page
itself
was
dusk.
This
face,
potent
in
the
majesty
of
its
traits,
shed
down
on
her
hope,
fondness,
delight.
"Will
the
repeal
do
you
good
much
good,
immediate
good?"
she
inquired.
"The
repeal
of
the
Orders
in
Council
saves
me.
Now
I
shall
not
turn
bankrupt;
now
I
shall
not
give
up
business;
now
I
shall
not
leave
England;
now
I
shall
be
no
longer
poor;
now
I
can
pay
my
debts;
now
all
the
cloth
I
have
in
my
warehouses
will
be
taken
off
my
hands,
and
commissions
given
me
for
much
more.
This
day
lays
for
my
fortunes
a
broad,
firm
foundation,
on
which,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
can
securely
build."
Caroline
devoured
his
words;
she
held
his
hand
in
hers;
she
drew
a
long
breath.
"You
are
saved?
Your
heavy
difficulties
are
lifted?"
"They
are
lifted.
I
breathe.
I
can
act."
"At
last!
Oh,
Providence
is
kind!
Thank
Him,
Robert."
"I
do
thank
Providence."
"And
I
also,
for
your
sake!"
She
looked
up
devoutly.
"Now
I
can
take
more
workmen,
give
better
wages,
lay
wiser
and
more
liberal
plans,
do
some
good,
be
less
selfish.
Now,
Caroline,
I
can
have
a
house
a
home
which
I
can
truly
call
mine
and
now
"
He
paused,
for
his
deep
voice
was
checked.
"And
now,"
he
resumed
"now
I
can
think
of
marriage,
now
I
can
seek
a
wife."
This
was
no
moment
for
her
to
speak.
She
did
not
speak.
"Will
Caroline,
who
meekly
hopes
to
be
forgiven
as
she
forgives
will
she
pardon
all
I
have
made
her
suffer,
all
that
long
pain
I
have
wickedly
caused
her,
all
that
sickness
of
body
and
mind
she
owed
to
me?
Will
she
forget
what
she
knows
of
my
poor
ambition,
my
sordid
schemes?
Will
she
let
me
expiate
these
things?
Will
she
suffer
me
to
prove
that,
as
I
once
deserted
cruelly,
trifled
wantonly,
injured
basely,
I
can
now
love
faithfully,
cherish
fondly,
treasure
tenderly?"
His
hand
was
in
Caroline's
still;
a
gentle
pressure
answered
him.
"Is
Caroline
mine?"
"Caroline
is
yours."
"I
will
prize
her.
The
sense
of
her
value
is
here,
in
my
heart;
the
necessity
for
her
society
is
blended
with
my
life.
Not
more
jealous
shall
I
be
of
the
blood
whose
flow
moves
my
pulses
than
of
her
happiness
and
well
being."
"I
love
you,
too,
Robert,
and
will
take
faithful
care
of
you."
"Will
you
take
faithful
care
of
me?
Faithful
care!
As
if
that
rose
should
promise
to
shelter
from
tempest
this
hard
gray
stone!
But
she
will
care
for
me,
in
her
way.
These
hands
will
be
the
gentle
ministrants
of
every
comfort
I
can
taste.
I
know
the
being
I
seek
to
entwine
with
my
own
will
bring
me
a
solace,
a
charity,
a
purity,
to
which,
of
myself,
I
am
a
stranger."
Suddenly
Caroline
was
troubled;
her
lip
quivered.
"What
flutters
my
dove?"
asked
Moore,
as
she
nestled
to
and
then
uneasily
shrank
from
him.
"Poor
mamma!
I
am
all
mamma
has.
Must
I
leave
her?"
"Do
you
know,
I
thought
of
that
difficulty.
I
and
'mamma'
have
discussed
it."
"Tell
me
what
you
wish,
what
you
would
like,
and
I
will
consider
if
it
is
possible
to
consent.
But
I
cannot
desert
her,
even
for
you.
I
cannot
break
her
heart,
even
for
your
sake."
"She
was
faithful
when
I
was
false
was
she
not?
I
never
came
near
your
sick
bed,
and
she
watched
it
ceaselessly."
"What
must
I
do?
Anything
but
leave
her."
"At
my
wish
you
never
shall
leave
her."
"She
may
live
very
near
us?"
"With
us
only
she
will
have
her
own
rooms
and
servant.
For
this
she
stipulates
herself."
"You
know
she
has
an
income,
that,
with
her
habits,
makes
her
quite
independent?"
"She
told
me
that,
with
a
gentle
pride
that
reminded
me
of
somebody
else."
"She
is
not
at
all
interfering,
and
incapable
of
gossip."
"I
know
her,
Cary.
But
if,
instead
of
being
the
personification
of
reserve
and
discretion,
she
were
something
quite
opposite,
I
should
not
fear
her."
"Yet
she
will
be
your
mother
in
law?"
The
speaker
gave
an
arch
little
nod.
Moore
smiled.
"Louis
and
I
are
not
of
the
order
of
men
who
fear
their
mothers
in
law,
Cary.
Our
foes
never
have
been,
nor
will
be,
those
of
our
own
household.
I
doubt
not
my
mother
in
law
will
make
much
of
me."
"That
she
will
in
her
quiet
way,
you
know.
She
is
not
demonstrative;
and
when
you
see
her
silent,
or
even
cool,
you
must
not
fancy
her
displeased;
it
is
only
a
manner
she
has.
Be
sure
to
let
me
interpret
for
her
whenever
she
puzzles
you;
always
believe
my
account
of
the
matter,
Robert."
"Oh,
implicitly!
Jesting
apart,
I
feel
that
she
and
I
will
suit
on
ne
peut
mieux.
Hortense,
you
know,
is
exquisitely
susceptible
in
our
French
sense
of
the
word
and
not,
perhaps,
always
reasonable
in
her
requirements;
yet,
dear,
honest
girl,
I
never
painfully
wounded
her
feelings
or
had
a
serious
quarrel
with
her
in
my
life."
"No;
you
are
most
generously
considerate,
indeed,
most
tenderly
indulgent
to
her;
and
you
will
be
considerate
with
mamma.
You
are
a
gentleman
all
through,
Robert,
to
the
bone,
and
nowhere
so
perfect
a
gentleman
as
at
your
own
fireside."
"A
eulogium
I
like;
it
is
very
sweet.
I
am
well
pleased
my
Caroline
should
view
me
in
this
light."
"Mamma
just
thinks
of
you
as
I
do."
"Not
quite,
I
hope?"
"She
does
not
want
to
marry
you
don't
be
vain;
but
she
said
to
me
the
other
day,
'My
dear,
Mr.
Moore
has
pleasing
manners;
he
is
one
of
the
few
gentlemen
I
have
seen
who
combine
politeness
with
an
air
of
sincerity.'"
"'Mamma'
is
rather
a
misanthropist,
is
she
not?
Not
the
best
opinion
of
the
sterner
sex?"
"She
forbears
to
judge
them
as
a
whole,
but
she
has
her
exceptions
whom
she
admires
Louis
and
Mr.
Hall,
and,
of
late,
yourself.
She
did
not
like
you
once;
I
knew
that,
because
she
would
never
speak
of
you.
But,
Robert
"
"Well,
what
now?
What
is
the
new
thought?"
"You
have
not
seen
my
uncle
yet?"
"I
have.
'Mamma'
called
him
into
the
room.
He
consents
conditionally.
If
I
prove
that
I
can
keep
a
wife,
I
may
have
her;
and
I
can
keep
her
better
than
he
thinks
better
than
I
choose
to
boast."
"If
you
get
rich
you
will
do
good
with
your
money,
Robert?"
"I
will
do
good;
you
shall
tell
me
how.
Indeed,
I
have
some
schemes
of
my
own,
which
you
and
I
will
talk
about
on
our
own
hearth
one
day.
I
have
seen
the
necessity
of
doing
good;
I
have
learned
the
downright
folly
of
being
selfish.
Caroline,
I
foresee
what
I
will
now
foretell.
This
war
must
ere
long
draw
to
a
close.
Trade
is
likely
to
prosper
for
some
years
to
come.
There
may
be
a
brief
misunderstanding
between
England
and
America,
but
that
will
not
last.
What
would
you
think
if,
one
day
perhaps
ere
another
ten
years
elapse
Louis
and
I
divide
Briarfield
parish
betwixt
us?
Louis,
at
any
rate,
is
certain
of
power
and
property.
He
will
not
bury
his
talents.
He
is
a
benevolent
fellow,
and
has,
besides,
an
intellect
of
his
own
of
no
trifling
calibre.
His
mind
is
slow
but
strong.
It
must
work.
It
may
work
deliberately,
but
it
will
work
well.
He
will
be
made
magistrate
of
the
district
Shirley
says
he
shall.
She
would
proceed
impetuously
and
prematurely
to
obtain
for
him
this
dignity,
if
he
would
let
her,
but
he
will
not.
As
usual,
he
will
be
in
no
haste.
Ere
he
has
been
master
of
Fieldhead
a
year
all
the
district
will
feel
his
quiet
influence,
and
acknowledge
his
unassuming
superiority.
A
magistrate
is
wanted;
they
will,
in
time,
invest
him
with
the
office
voluntarily
and
unreluctantly.
Everybody
admires
his
future
wife,
and
everybody
will,
in
time,
like
him.
He
is
of
the
pate
generally
approved,
bon
comme
le
pain
daily
bread
for
the
most
fastidious,
good
for
the
infant
and
the
aged,
nourishing
for
the
poor,
wholesome
for
the
rich.
Shirley,
in
spite
of
her
whims
and
oddities,
her
dodges
and
delays,
has
an
infatuated
fondness
for
him.
She
will
one
day
see
him
as
universally
beloved
as
even
she
could
wish.
He
will
also
be
universally
esteemed,
considered,
consulted,
depended
on
too
much
so.
His
advice
will
be
always
judicious,
his
help
always
good
natured.
Ere
long
both
will
be
in
inconvenient
request.
He
will
have
to
impose
restrictions.
As
for
me,
if
I
succeed
as
I
intend
to
do,
my
success
will
add
to
his
and
Shirley's
income.
I
can
double
the
value
of
their
mill
property.
I
can
line
yonder
barren
Hollow
with
lines
of
cottages
and
rows
of
cottage
gardens
"
"Robert!
And
root
up
the
copse?"
"The
copse
shall
be
firewood
ere
five
years
elapse.
The
beautiful
wild
ravine
shall
be
a
smooth
descent;
the
green
natural
terrace
shall
be
a
paved
street.
There
shall
be
cottages
in
the
dark
ravine,
and
cottages
on
the
lonely
slopes.
The
rough
pebbled
track
shall
be
an
even,
firm,
broad,
black,
sooty
road,
bedded
with
the
cinders
from
my
mill;
and
my
mill,
Caroline
my
mill
shall
fill
its
present
yard."
"Horrible!
You
will
change
our
blue
hill
country
air
into
the
Stilbro'
smoke
atmosphere."
"I
will
pour
the
waters
of
Pactolus
through
the
valley
of
Briarfield."
"I
like
the
beck
a
thousand
times
better."
"I
will
get
an
Act
for
enclosing
Nunnely
Common,
and
parcelling
it
out
into
farms."
"Stilbro'
Moor,
however,
defies
you,
thank
Heaven!
What
can
you
grow
in
Bilberry
Moss?
What
will
flourish
on
Rushedge?"
"Caroline,
the
houseless,
the
starving,
the
unemployed
shall
come
to
Hollow's
Mill
from
far
and
near;
and
Joe
Scott
shall
give
them
work,
and
Louis
Moore,
Esq.,
shall
let
them
a
tenement,
and
Mrs.
Gill
shall
mete
them
a
portion
till
the
first
pay
day."
She
smiled
up
in
his
face.
"Such
a
Sunday
school
as
you
will
have,
Cary!
such
collections
as
you
will
get!
such
a
day
school
as
you
and
Shirley
and
Miss
Ainley
will
have
to
manage
between
you!
The
mill
shall
find
salaries
for
a
master
and
mistress,
and
the
squire
or
the
clothier
shall
give
a
treat
once
a
quarter."
She
mutely
offered
a
kiss
an
offer
taken
unfair
advantage
of,
to
the
extortion
of
about
a
hundred
kisses.
"Extravagant
day
dreams,"
said
Moore,
with
a
sigh
and
smile,
"yet
perhaps
we
may
realize
some
of
them.
Meantime,
the
dew
is
falling.
Mrs.
Moore,
I
shall
take
you
in."
It
is
August.
The
bells
clash
out
again,
not
only
through
Yorkshire,
but
through
England.
From
Spain
the
voice
of
a
trumpet
has
sounded
long;
it
now
waxes
louder
and
louder;
it
proclaims
Salamanca
won.
This
night
is
Briarfield
to
be
illuminated.
On
this
day
the
Fieldhead
tenantry
dine
together;
the
Hollow's
Mill
workpeople
will
be
assembled
for
a
like
festal
purpose;
the
schools
have
a
grand
treat.
This
morning
there
were
two
marriages
solemnized
in
Briarfield
church
Louis
Gerard
Moore,
Esq.,
late
of
Antwerp,
to
Shirley,
daughter
of
the
late
Charles
Cave
Keeldar,
Esq.,
of
Fieldhead;
Robert
Gerard
Moore,
Esq.,
of
Hollow's
Mill,
to
Caroline,
niece
of
the
Rev.
Matthewson
Helstone,
M.A.,
rector
of
Briarfield.
The
ceremony,
in
the
first
instance,
was
performed
by
Mr.
Helstone,
Hiram
Yorke,
Esq.,
of
Briarmains,
giving
the
bride
away.
In
the
second
instance,
Mr.
Hall,
vicar
of
Nunnely,
officiated.
Amongst
the
bridal
train
the
two
most
noticeable
personages
were
the
youthful
bridesmen,
Henry
Sympson
and
Martin
Yorke.
I
suppose
Robert
Moore's
prophecies
were,
partially
at
least,
fulfilled.
The
other
day
I
passed
up
the
Hollow,
which
tradition
says
was
once
green,
and
lone,
and
wild;
and
there
I
saw
the
manufacturer's
day
dreams
embodied
in
substantial
stone
and
brick
and
ashes
the
cinder
black
highway,
the
cottages,
and
the
cottage
gardens;
there
I
saw
a
mighty
mill,
and
a
chimney
ambitious
as
the
tower
of
Babel.
I
told
my
old
housekeeper
when
I
came
home
where
I
had
been.
"Ay,"
said
she,
"this
world
has
queer
changes.
I
can
remember
the
old
mill
being
built
the
very
first
it
was
in
all
the
district;
and
then
I
can
remember
it
being
pulled
down,
and
going
with
my
lake
lasses
[companions]
to
see
the
foundation
stone
of
the
new
one
laid.
The
two
Mr.
Moores
made
a
great
stir
about
it.
They
were
there,
and
a
deal
of
fine
folk
besides,
and
both
their
ladies;
very
bonny
and
grand
they
looked.
But
Mrs.
Louis
was
the
grandest;
she
always
wore
such
handsome
dresses.
Mrs.
Robert
was
quieter
like.
Mrs.
Louis
smiled
when
she
talked.
She
had
a
real,
happy,
glad,
good
natured
look;
but
she
had
een
that
pierced
a
body
through.
There
is
no
such
ladies
nowadays."
"What
was
the
Hollow
like
then,
Martha?"
"Different
to
what
it
is
now;
but
I
can
tell
of
it
clean
different
again,
when
there
was
neither
mill,
nor
cot,
nor
hall,
except
Fieldhead,
within
two
miles
of
it.
I
can
tell,
one
summer
evening,
fifty
years
syne,
my
mother
coming
running
in
just
at
the
edge
of
dark,
almost
fleyed
out
of
her
wits,
saying
she
had
seen
a
fairish
[fairy]
in
Fieldhead
Hollow;
and
that
was
the
last
fairish
that
ever
was
seen
on
this
countryside
(though
they've
been
heard
within
these
forty
years).
A
lonesome
spot
it
was,
and
a
bonny
spot,
full
of
oak
trees
and
nut
trees.
It
is
altered
now."
The
story
is
told.
I
think
I
now
see
the
judicious
reader
putting
on
his
spectacles
to
look
for
the
moral.
It
would
be
an
insult
to
his
sagacity
to
offer
directions.
I
only
say,
God
speed
him
in
the
