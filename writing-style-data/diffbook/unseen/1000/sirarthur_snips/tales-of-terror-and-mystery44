time,
and
she
had
three
medical
students
and
one
engineer
as
lodgers.
I
occupied
the
top
room,
which
was
the
cheapest,
but
cheap
as
it
was
it
was
more
than
I
could
afford.
My
small
resources
were
dwindling
away,
and
every
week
it
became
more
necessary
that
I
should
find
something
to
do.
Yet
I
was
very
unwilling
to
go
into
general
practice,
for
my
tastes
were
all
in
the
direction
of
science,
and
especially
of
zoology,
towards
which
I
had
always
a
strong
leaning.
I
had
almost
given
the
fight
up
and
resigned
myself
to
being
a
medical
drudge
for
life,
when
the
turning
point
of
my
struggles
came
in
a
very
extraordinary
way.
One
morning
I
had
picked
up
the
Standard
and
was
glancing
over
its
contents.
There
was
a
complete
absence
of
news,
and
I
was
about
to
toss
the
paper
down
again,
when
my
eyes
were
caught
by
an
advertisement
at
the
head
of
the
personal
column.
It
was
worded
in
this
way:
"Wanted
for
one
or
more
days
the
services
of
a
medical
man.
It
is
essential
that
he
should
be
a
man
of
strong
physique,
of
steady
nerves,
and
of
a
resolute
nature.
Must
be
an
entomologist
coleopterist
preferred.
Apply,
in
person,
at
77B,
Brook
Street.
Application
must
be
made
before
twelve
o'clock
today."
Now,
I
have
already
said
that
I
was
devoted
to
zoology.
Of
all
branches
of
zoology,
the
study
of
insects
was
the
most
attractive
to
me,
and
of
all
insects
beetles
were
the
species
with
which
I
was
most
familiar.
Butterfly
collectors
are
numerous,
but
beetles
are
far
more
varied,
and
more
accessible
in
these
islands
than
are
butterflies.
It
was
this
fact
which
had
attracted
my
attention
to
them,
and
I
had
myself
made
a
collection
which
numbered
some
hundred
varieties.
As
to
the
other
requisites
of
the
advertisement,
I
knew
that
my
nerves
could
be
depended
upon,
and
I
had
won
the
weight
throwing
competition
at
the
inter
hospital
sports.
Clearly,
I
was
the
very
man
for
the
vacancy.
Within
five
minutes
of
my
having
read
the
advertisement
I
was
in
a
cab
and
on
my
was
to
Brook
Street.
As
I
drove,
I
kept
turning
the
matter
over
in
my
head
and
trying
to
make
a
guess
as
to
what
sort
of
employment
it
could
be
which
needed
such
curious
qualifications.
A
strong
physique,
a
resolute
nature,
a
medical
training,
and
a
knowledge
of
beetles
what
connection
could
there
be
between
these
various
requisites?
And
then
there
was
the
disheartening
fact
that
the
situation
was
not
a
permanent
one,
but
terminable
from
day
to
day,
according
to
the
terms
of
the
advertisement.
The
more
I
pondered
over
it
the
more
unintelligible
did
it
become;
but
at
the
end
of
my
meditations
I
always
came
back
to
the
ground
fact
that,
come
what
might,
I
had
nothing
to
lose,
that
I
was
completely
at
the
end
of
my
resources,
and
that
I
was
ready
for
any
adventure,
however
desperate,
which
would
put
a
few
honest
sovereigns
into
my
pocket.
The
man
fears
to
fail
who
has
to
pay
for
his
failure,
but
there
was
no
penalty
which
Fortune
could
exact
from
me.
I
was
like
the
gambler
with
empty
pockets,
who
is
still
allowed
to
try
his
luck
with
the
others.
No.
77B,
Brook
Street,
was
one
of
those
dingy
and
yet
imposing
houses,
dun
coloured
and
flat
faced,
with
the
intensely
respectable
and
solid
air
which
marks
the
Georgian
builder.
As
I
alighted
from
the
cab,
a
young
man
came
out
of
the
door
and
walked
swiftly
down
the
street.
In
passing
me,
I
noticed
that
he
cast
an
inquisitive
and
somewhat
malevolent
glance
at
me,
and
I
took
the
incident
as
a
good
omen,
for
his
appearance
was
that
of
a
rejected
candidate,
and
if
he
resented
my
application
it
meant
that
the
vacancy
was
not
yet
filled
up.
Full
of
hope,
I
ascended
the
broad
steps
and
rapped
with
the
heavy
knocker.
A
footman
in
powder
and
livery
opened
the
door.
Clearly
I
was
in
touch
with
the
people
of
wealth
and
fashion.
"Yes,
sir?"
said
the
footman.
"I
came
in
answer
to
"
"Quite
so,
sir,"
said
the
footman.
"Lord
Linchmere
will
see
you
at
once
in
the
library."
Lord
Linchmere!
I
had
vaguely
heard
the
name,
but
could
not
for
the
instant
recall
anything
about
him.
Following
the
footman,
I
was
shown
into
a
large,
book
lined
room
in
which
there
was
seated
behind
a
writing
desk
a
small
man
with
a
pleasant,
clean
shaven,
mobile
face,
and
long
hair
shot
with
grey,
brushed
back
from
his
forehead.
He
looked
me
up
and
down
with
a
very
shrewd,
penetrating
glance,
holding
the
card
which
the
footman
had
given
him
in
his
right
hand.
Then
he
smiled
pleasantly,
and
I
felt
that
externally
at
any
rate
I
possessed
the
qualifications
which
he
desired.
"You
have
come
in
answer
to
my
advertisement,
Dr.
Hamilton?"
he
asked.
"Yes,
sir."
"Do
you
fulfil
the
conditions
which
are
there
laid
down?"
"I
believe
that
I
do."
"You
are
a
powerful
man,
or
so
I
should
judge
from
your
appearance.
"I
think
that
I
am
fairly
strong."
"And
resolute?"
"I
believe
so."
"Have
you
ever
known
what
it
was
to
be
exposed
to
imminent
danger?"
"No,
I
don't
know
that
I
ever
have."
"But
you
think
you
would
be
prompt
and
cool
at
such
a
time?"
"I
hope
so."
"Well,
I
believe
that
you
would.
I
have
the
more
confidence
in
you
because
you
do
not
pretend
to
be
certain
as
to
what
you
would
do
in
a
position
that
was
new
to
you.
My
impression
is
that,
so
far
as
personal
qualities
go,
you
are
the
very
man
of
whom
I
am
in
search.
That
being
settled,
we
may
pass
on
to
the
next
point."
"Which
is?"
"To
talk
to
me
about
beetles."
I
looked
across
to
see
if
he
was
joking,
but,
on
the
contrary,
he
was
