cut
away
and
made
top
heavy
by
the
rush
of
the
stream,
so
that
it
tilted
over
as
I
landed
on
it
and
shot
me
into
the
ice
cold
water.
My
candle
went
out,
and
I
found
myself
floundering
about
in
utter
and
absolute
darkness.
I
staggered
to
my
feet
again,
more
amused
than
alarmed
by
my
adventure.
The
candle
had
fallen
from
my
hand,
and
was
lost
in
the
stream,
but
I
had
two
others
in
my
pocket,
so
that
it
was
of
no
importance.
I
got
one
of
them
ready,
and
drew
out
my
box
of
matches
to
light
it.
Only
then
did
I
realize
my
position.
The
box
had
been
soaked
in
my
fall
into
the
river.
It
was
impossible
to
strike
the
matches.
A
cold
hand
seemed
to
close
round
my
heart
as
I
realized
my
position.
The
darkness
was
opaque
and
horrible.
It
was
so
utter
one
put
one's
hand
up
to
one's
face
as
if
to
press
off
something
solid.
I
stood
still,
and
by
an
effort
I
steadied
myself.
I
tried
to
reconstruct
in
my
mind
a
map
of
the
floor
of
the
cavern
as
I
had
last
seen
it.
Alas!
the
bearings
which
had
impressed
themselves
upon
my
mind
were
high
on
the
wall,
and
not
to
be
found
by
touch.
Still,
I
remembered
in
a
general
way
how
the
sides
were
situated,
and
I
hoped
that
by
groping
my
way
along
them
I
should
at
last
come
to
the
opening
of
the
Roman
tunnel.
Moving
very
slowly,
and
continually
striking
against
the
rocks,
I
set
out
on
this
desperate
quest.
But
I
very
soon
realized
how
impossible
it
was.
In
that
black,
velvety
darkness
one
lost
all
one's
bearings
in
an
instant.
Before
I
had
made
a
dozen
paces,
I
was
utterly
bewildered
as
to
my
whereabouts.
The
rippling
of
the
stream,
which
was
the
one
sound
audible,
showed
me
where
it
lay,
but
the
moment
that
I
left
its
bank
I
was
utterly
lost.
The
idea
of
finding
my
way
back
in
absolute
darkness
through
that
limestone
labyrinth
was
clearly
an
impossible
one.
I
sat
down
upon
a
boulder
and
reflected
upon
my
unfortunate
plight.
I
had
not
told
anyone
that
I
proposed
to
come
to
the
Blue
John
mine,
and
it
was
unlikely
that
a
search
party
would
come
after
me.
Therefore
I
must
trust
to
my
own
resources
to
get
clear
of
the
danger.
There
was
only
one
hope,
and
that
was
that
the
matches
might
dry.
When
I
fell
into
the
river,
only
half
of
me
had
got
thoroughly
wet.
My
left
shoulder
had
remained
above
the
water.
I
took
the
box
of
matches,
therefore,
and
put
it
into
my
left
armpit.
The
moist
air
of
the
cavern
might
possibly
be
counteracted
by
the
heat
of
my
body,
but
even
so,
I
knew
that
I
could
not
hope
to
get
a
light
for
many
hours.
Meanwhile
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait.
By
good
luck
I
had
slipped
several
biscuits
into
my
pocket
before
I
left
the
farm
house.
These
I
now
devoured,
and
washed
them
down
with
a
draught
from
that
wretched
stream
which
had
been
the
cause
of
all
my
misfortunes.
Then
I
felt
about
for
a
comfortable
seat
among
the
rocks,
and,
having
discovered
a
place
where
I
could
get
a
support
for
my
back,
I
stretched
out
my
legs
and
settled
myself
down
to
wait.
I
was
wretchedly
damp
and
cold,
but
I
tried
to
cheer
myself
with
the
reflection
that
modern
science
prescribed
open
windows
and
walks
in
all
weather
for
my
disease.
Gradually,
lulled
by
the
monotonous
gurgle
of
the
stream,
and
by
the
absolute
darkness,
I
sank
into
an
uneasy
slumber.
How
long
this
lasted
I
cannot
say.
It
may
have
been
for
an
hour,
it
may
have
been
for
several.
Suddenly
I
sat
up
on
my
rock
couch,
with
every
nerve
thrilling
and
every
sense
acutely
on
the
alert.
Beyond
all
doubt
I
had
heard
a
sound
some
sound
very
distinct
from
the
gurgling
of
the
waters.
It
had
passed,
but
the
reverberation
of
it
still
lingered
in
my
ear.
Was
it
a
search
party?
They
would
most
certainly
have
shouted,
and
vague
as
this
sound
was
which
had
wakened
me,
it
was
very
distinct
from
the
human
voice.
I
sat
palpitating
and
hardly
daring
to
breathe.
There
it
was
again!
And
again!
Now
it
had
become
continuous.
It
was
a
tread
yes,
surely
it
was
the
tread
of
some
living
creature.
But
what
a
tread
it
was!
It
gave
one
the
impression
of
enormous
weight
carried
upon
sponge
like
feet,
which
gave
forth
a
muffled
but
ear
filling
sound.
The
darkness
was
as
complete
as
ever,
but
the
tread
was
regular
and
decisive.
And
it
was
coming
beyond
all
question
in
my
direction.
My
skin
grew
cold,
and
my
hair
stood
on
end
as
I
listened
to
that
steady
and
ponderous
footfall.
There
was
some
creature
there,
and
surely
by
the
speed
of
its
advance,
it
was
one
which
could
see
in
the
dark.
I
crouched
low
on
my
rock
and
tried
to
blend
myself
into
it.
The
steps
grew
nearer
still,
then
stopped,
and
presently
I
was
aware
of
a
loud
lapping
and
gurgling.
The
creature
was
drinking
at
the
stream.
Then
again
there
was
silence,
broken
by
a
succession
of
long
sniffs
and
snorts
of
tremendous
volume
and
energy.
Had
it
caught
the
scent
of
me?
My
own
nostrils
were
filled
by
a
low
fetid
odour,
mephitic
and
abominable.
Then
I
heard
the
steps
again.
They
were
on
my
side
of
the
stream
now.
The
stones
rattled
within
a
few
yards
of
where
I
lay.
Hardly
daring
to
breathe,
I
crouched
upon
my
rock.
Then
the
steps
drew
away.
I
heard
the
splash
as
it
returned
across
the
river,
and
the
sound
died
away
into
the
distance
in
the
direction
from
which
it
had
come.
For
a
long
time
I
lay
upon
the
rock,
