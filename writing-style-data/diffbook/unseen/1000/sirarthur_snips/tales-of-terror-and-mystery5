is
very
clear
to
me
that
the
insensibility
which
came
upon
Glaisher,
and
in
a
lesser
degree
upon
Coxwell,
when,
in
1862,
they
ascended
in
a
balloon
to
the
height
of
thirty
thousand
feet,
was
due
to
the
extreme
speed
with
which
a
perpendicular
ascent
is
made.
Doing
it
at
an
easy
gradient
and
accustoming
oneself
to
the
lessened
barometric
pressure
by
slow
degrees,
there
are
no
such
dreadful
symptoms.
At
the
same
great
height
I
found
that
even
without
my
oxygen
inhaler
I
could
breathe
without
undue
distress.
It
was
bitterly
cold,
however,
and
my
thermometer
was
at
zero,
Fahrenheit.
At
one
thirty
I
was
nearly
seven
miles
above
the
surface
of
the
earth,
and
still
ascending
steadily.
I
found,
however,
that
the
rarefied
air
was
giving
markedly
less
support
to
my
planes,
and
that
my
angle
of
ascent
had
to
be
considerably
lowered
in
consequence.
It
was
already
clear
that
even
with
my
light
weight
and
strong
engine
power
there
was
a
point
in
front
of
me
where
I
should
be
held.
To
make
matters
worse,
one
of
my
sparking
plugs
was
in
trouble
again
and
there
was
intermittent
misfiring
in
the
engine.
My
heart
was
heavy
with
the
fear
of
failure.
"It
was
about
that
time
that
I
had
a
most
extraordinary
experience.
Something
whizzed
past
me
in
a
trail
of
smoke
and
exploded
with
a
loud,
hissing
sound,
sending
forth
a
cloud
of
steam.
For
the
instant
I
could
not
imagine
what
had
happened.
Then
I
remembered
that
the
earth
is
for
ever
being
bombarded
by
meteor
stones,
and
would
be
hardly
inhabitable
were
they
not
in
nearly
every
case
turned
to
vapour
in
the
outer
layers
of
the
atmosphere.
Here
is
a
new
danger
for
the
high
altitude
man,
for
two
others
passed
me
when
I
was
nearing
the
forty
thousand
foot
mark.
I
cannot
doubt
that
at
the
edge
of
the
earth's
envelope
the
risk
would
be
a
very
real
one.
"My
barograph
needle
marked
forty
one
thousand
three
hundred
when
I
became
aware
that
I
could
go
no
farther.
Physically,
the
strain
was
not
as
yet
greater
than
I
could
bear
but
my
machine
had
reached
its
limit.
The
attenuated
air
gave
no
firm
support
to
the
wings,
and
the
least
tilt
developed
into
side
slip,
while
she
seemed
sluggish
on
her
controls.
Possibly,
had
the
engine
been
at
its
best,
another
thousand
feet
might
have
been
within
our
capacity,
but
it
was
still
misfiring,
and
two
out
of
the
ten
cylinders
appeared
to
be
out
of
action.
If
I
had
not
already
reached
the
zone
for
which
I
was
searching
then
I
should
never
see
it
upon
this
journey.
But
was
it
not
possible
that
I
had
attained
it?
Soaring
in
circles
like
a
monstrous
hawk
upon
the
forty
thousand
foot
level
I
let
the
monoplane
guide
herself,
and
with
my
Mannheim
glass
I
made
a
careful
observation
of
my
surroundings.
The
heavens
were
perfectly
clear;
there
was
no
indication
of
those
dangers
which
I
had
imagined.
"I
have
said
that
I
was
soaring
in
circles.
It
struck
me
suddenly
that
I
would
do
well
to
take
a
wider
sweep
and
open
up
a
new
airtract.
If
the
hunter
entered
an
earth
jungle
he
would
drive
through
it
if
he
wished
to
find
his
game.
My
reasoning
had
led
me
to
believe
that
the
air
jungle
which
I
had
imagined
lay
somewhere
over
Wiltshire.
This
should
be
to
the
south
and
west
of
me.
I
took
my
bearings
from
the
sun,
for
the
compass
was
hopeless
and
no
trace
of
earth
was
to
be
seen
nothing
but
the
distant,
silver
cloud
plain.
However,
I
got
my
direction
as
best
I
might
and
kept
her
head
straight
to
the
mark.
I
reckoned
that
my
petrol
supply
would
not
last
for
more
than
another
hour
or
so,
but
I
could
afford
to
use
it
to
the
last
drop,
since
a
single
magnificent
vol
plane
could
at
any
time
take
me
to
the
earth.
"Suddenly
I
was
aware
of
something
new.
The
air
in
front
of
me
had
lost
its
crystal
clearness.
It
was
full
of
long,
ragged
wisps
of
something
which
I
can
only
compare
to
very
fine
cigarette
smoke.
It
hung
about
in
wreaths
and
coils,
turning
and
twisting
slowly
in
the
sunlight.
As
the
monoplane
shot
through
it,
I
was
aware
of
a
faint
taste
of
oil
upon
my
lips,
and
there
was
a
greasy
scum
upon
the
woodwork
of
the
machine.
Some
infinitely
fine
organic
matter
appeared
to
be
suspended
in
the
atmosphere.
There
was
no
life
there.
It
was
inchoate
and
diffuse,
extending
for
many
square
acres
and
then
fringing
off
into
the
void.
No,
it
was
not
life.
But
might
it
not
be
the
remains
of
life?
Above
all,
might
it
not
be
the
food
of
life,
of
monstrous
life,
even
as
the
humble
grease
of
the
ocean
is
the
food
for
the
mighty
whale?
The
thought
was
in
my
mind
when
my
eyes
looked
upwards
and
I
saw
the
most
wonderful
vision
that
ever
man
has
seen.
Can
I
hope
to
convey
it
to
you
even
as
I
saw
it
myself
last
Thursday?
"Conceive
a
jelly
fish
such
as
sails
in
our
summer
seas,
bell
shaped
and
of
enormous
size
far
larger,
I
should
judge,
than
the
dome
of
St.
Paul's.
It
was
of
a
light
pink
colour
veined
with
a
delicate
green,
but
the
whole
huge
fabric
so
tenuous
that
it
was
but
a
fairy
outline
against
the
dark
blue
sky.
It
pulsated
with
a
delicate
and
regular
rhythm.
From
it
there
depended
two
long,
drooping,
green
tentacles,
which
swayed
slowly
backwards
and
forwards.
This
gorgeous
vision
passed
gently
with
noiseless
dignity
over
my
head,
as
light
and
fragile
as
a
soap
bubble,
and
drifted
upon
its
stately
way.
"I
had
half
turned
my
monoplane,
that
I
might
look
after
this
beautiful
creature,
when,
in
a
moment,
I
found
myself
amidst
a
perfect
fleet
of
them,
of
