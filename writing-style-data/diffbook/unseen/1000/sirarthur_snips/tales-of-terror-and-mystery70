in
the
Capitol.
There
are,
as
you
see,
twelve
magnificent
stones,
inscribed
with
mystical
characters.
Counting
from
the
left
hand
top
corner,
the
stones
are
carnelian,
peridot,
emerald,
ruby,
lapis
lazuli,
onyx,
sapphire,
agate,
amethyst,
topaz,
beryl,
and
jasper."
I
was
amazed
at
the
variety
and
beauty
of
the
stones.
"Has
the
breastplate
any
particular
history?"
I
asked.
"It
is
of
great
age
and
of
immense
value,"
said
Professor
Andreas.
"Without
being
able
to
make
an
absolute
assertion,
we
have
many
reasons
to
think
that
it
is
possible
that
it
may
be
the
original
urim
and
thummim
of
Solomon's
Temple.
There
is
certainly
nothing
so
fine
in
any
collection
in
Europe.
My
friend,
Captain
Wilson,
here,
is
a
practical
authority
upon
precious
stones,
and
he
would
tell
you
how
pure
these
are."
Captain
Wilson,
a
man
with
a
dark,
hard,
incisive
face,
was
standing
beside
his
fiancee
at
the
other
side
of
the
case.
"Yes,"
said
he,
curtly,
"I
have
never
seen
finer
stones."
"And
the
gold
work
is
also
worthy
of
attention.
The
ancients
excelled
in
"
he
was
apparently
about
to
indicate
the
setting
of
the
stones,
when
Captain
Wilson
interrupted
him.
"You
will
see
a
finer
example
of
their
gold
work
in
this
candlestick,"
said
he,
turning
to
another
table,
and
we
all
joined
him
in
his
admiration
of
its
embossed
stem
and
delicately
ornamented
branches.
Altogether
it
was
an
interesting
and
a
novel
experience
to
have
objects
of
such
rarity
explained
by
so
great
an
expert;
and
when,
finally,
Professor
Andreas
finished
our
inspection
by
formally
handing
over
the
precious
collection
to
the
care
of
my
friend,
I
could
not
help
pitying
him
and
envying
his
successor
whose
life
was
to
pass
in
so
pleasant
a
duty.
Within
a
week,
Ward
Mortimer
was
duly
installed
in
his
new
set
of
rooms,
and
had
become
the
autocrat
of
the
Belmore
Street
Museum.
About
a
fortnight
afterwards
my
friend
gave
a
small
dinner
to
half
a
dozen
bachelor
friends
to
celebrate
his
promotion.
When
his
guests
were
departing
he
pulled
my
sleeve
and
signalled
to
me
that
he
wished
me
to
remain.
"You
have
only
a
few
hundred
yards
to
go,"
said
he
I
was
living
in
chambers
in
the
Albany.
"You
may
as
well
stay
and
have
a
quiet
cigar
with
me.
I
very
much
want
your
advice."
I
relapsed
into
an
arm
chair
and
lit
one
of
his
excellent
Matronas.
When
he
had
returned
from
seeing
the
last
of
his
guests
out,
he
drew
a
letter
from
his
dress
jacket
and
sat
down
opposite
to
me.
"This
is
an
anonymous
letter
which
I
received
this
morning,"
said
he.
"I
want
to
read
it
to
you
and
to
have
your
advice."
"You
are
very
welcome
to
it
for
what
it
is
worth."
"This
is
how
the
note
runs:
'Sir,
I
should
strongly
advise
you
to
keep
a
very
careful
watch
over
the
many
valuable
things
which
are
committed
to
your
charge.
I
do
not
think
that
the
present
system
of
a
single
watchman
is
sufficient.
Be
upon
your
guard,
or
an
irreparable
misfortune
may
occur.'"
"Is
that
all?"
"Yes,
that
is
all."
"Well,"
said
I,
"it
is
at
least
obvious
that
it
was
written
by
one
of
the
limited
number
of
people
who
are
aware
that
you
have
only
one
watchman
at
night."
Ward
Mortimer
handed
me
the
note,
with
a
curious
smile.
"Have
you
an
eye
for
handwriting?"
said
he.
"Now,
look
at
this!"
He
put
another
letter
in
front
of
me.
"Look
at
the
c
in
'congratulate'
and
the
c
in
'committed.'
Look
at
the
capital
I.
Look
at
the
trick
of
putting
in
a
dash
instead
of
a
stop!"
"They
are
undoubtedly
from
the
same
hand
with
some
attempt
at
disguise
in
the
case
of
this
first
one."
"The
second,"
said
Ward
Mortimer,
"is
the
letter
of
congratulation
which
was
written
to
me
by
Professor
Andreas
upon
my
obtaining
my
appointment."
I
stared
at
him
in
amazement.
Then
I
turned
over
the
letter
in
my
hand,
and
there,
sure
enough,
was
"Martin
Andreas"
signed
upon
the
other
side.
There
could
be
no
doubt,
in
the
mind
of
anyone
who
had
the
slightest
knowledge
of
the
science
of
graphology,
that
the
Professor
had
written
an
anonymous
letter,
warning
his
successor
against
thieves.
It
was
inexplicable,
but
it
was
certain.
"Why
should
he
do
it?"
I
asked.
"Precisely
what
I
should
wish
to
ask
you.
If
he
had
any
such
misgivings,
why
could
he
not
come
and
tell
me
direct?"
"Will
you
speak
to
him
about
it?"
"There
again
I
am
in
doubt.
He
might
choose
to
deny
that
he
wrote
it."
"At
any
rate,"
said
I,
"this
warning
is
meant
in
a
friendly
spirit,
and
I
should
certainly
act
upon
it.
Are
the
present
precautions
enough
to
insure
you
against
robbery?"
"I
should
have
thought
so.
The
public
are
only
admitted
from
ten
till
five,
and
there
is
a
guardian
to
every
two
rooms.
He
stands
at
the
door
between
them,
and
so
commands
them
both."
"But
at
night?"
"When
the
public
are
gone,
we
at
once
put
up
the
great
iron
shutters,
which
are
absolutely
burglar
proof.
The
watchman
is
a
capable
fellow.
He
sits
in
the
lodge,
but
he
walks
round
every
three
hours.
We
keep
one
electric
light
burning
in
each
room
all
night."
"It
is
difficult
to
suggest
anything
more
short
of
keeping
your
day
watches
all
night."
"We
could
not
afford
that."
"At
least,
I
should
communicate
with
the
police,
and
have
a
special
constable
put
on
outside
in
Belmore
Street,"
said
I.
"As
to
the
letter,
if
the
writer
wishes
to
be
anonymous,
I
think
he
has
a
right
to
remain
so.
We
must
trust
to
the
future
to
show
some
reason
for
the
curious
course
which
he
has
adopted."
So
we
dismissed
the
subject,
but
all
that
night
after
my
return
to
my
chambers
I
was
puzzling
my
brain
as
to
what
possible
motive
Professor
Andreas
could
have
