young
lady,
small,
dainty,
well
gloved,
and
dressed
in
the
most
perfect
taste.
There
was,
however,
a
plainness
and
simplicity
about
her
costume
which
bore
with
it
a
suggestion
of
limited
means.
The
dress
was
a
sombre
grayish
beige,
untrimmed
and
unbraided,
and
she
wore
a
small
turban
of
the
same
dull
hue,
relieved
only
by
a
suspicion
of
white
feather
in
the
side.
Her
face
had
neither
regularity
of
feature
nor
beauty
of
complexion,
but
her
expression
was
sweet
and
amiable,
and
her
large
blue
eyes
were
singularly
spiritual
and
sympathetic.
In
an
experience
of
women
which
extends
over
many
nations
and
three
separate
continents,
I
have
never
looked
upon
a
face
which
gave
a
clearer
promise
of
a
refined
and
sensitive
nature.
I
could
not
but
observe
that
as
she
took
the
seat
which
Sherlock
Holmes
placed
for
her,
her
lip
trembled,
her
hand
quivered,
and
she
showed
every
sign
of
intense
inward
agitation.
"I
have
come
to
you,
Mr.
Holmes,"
she
said,
"because
you
once
enabled
my
employer,
Mrs.
Cecil
Forrester,
to
unravel
a
little
domestic
complication.
She
was
much
impressed
by
your
kindness
and
skill."
"Mrs.
Cecil
Forrester,"
he
repeated
thoughtfully.
"I
believe
that
I
was
of
some
slight
service
to
her.
The
case,
however,
as
I
remember
it,
was
a
very
simple
one."
"She
did
not
think
so.
But
at
least
you
cannot
say
the
same
of
mine.
I
can
hardly
imagine
anything
more
strange,
more
utterly
inexplicable,
than
the
situation
in
which
I
find
myself."
Holmes
rubbed
his
hands,
and
his
eyes
glistened.
He
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
with
an
expression
of
extraordinary
concentration
upon
his
clear
cut,
hawklike
features.
"State
your
case,"
said
he,
in
brisk,
business
tones.
I
felt
that
my
position
was
an
embarrassing
one.
"You
will,
I
am
sure,
excuse
me,"
I
said,
rising
from
my
chair.
To
my
surprise,
the
young
lady
held
up
her
gloved
hand
to
detain
me.
"If
your
friend,"
she
said,
"would
be
good
enough
to
stop,
he
might
be
of
inestimable
service
to
me."
I
relapsed
into
my
chair.
"Briefly,"
she
continued,
"the
facts
are
these.
My
father
was
an
officer
in
an
Indian
regiment
who
sent
me
home
when
I
was
quite
a
child.
My
mother
was
dead,
and
I
had
no
relative
in
England.
I
was
placed,
however,
in
a
comfortable
boarding
establishment
at
Edinburgh,
and
there
I
remained
until
I
was
seventeen
years
of
age.
In
the
year
1878
my
father,
who
was
senior
captain
of
his
regiment,
obtained
twelve
months'
leave
and
came
home.
He
telegraphed
to
me
from
London
that
he
had
arrived
all
safe,
and
directed
me
to
come
down
at
once,
giving
the
Langham
Hotel
as
his
address.
His
message,
as
I
remember,
was
full
of
kindness
and
love.
On
reaching
London
I
drove
to
the
Langham,
and
was
informed
that
Captain
Morstan
was
staying
there,
but
that
he
had
gone
out
the
night
before
and
had
not
yet
returned.
I
waited
all
day
without
news
of
him.
That
night,
on
the
advice
of
the
manager
of
the
hotel,
I
communicated
with
the
police,
and
next
morning
we
advertised
in
all
the
papers.
Our
inquiries
led
to
no
result;
and
from
that
day
to
this
no
word
has
ever
been
heard
of
my
unfortunate
father.
He
came
home
with
his
heart
full
of
hope,
to
find
some
peace,
some
comfort,
and
instead
"
She
put
her
hand
to
her
throat,
and
a
choking
sob
cut
short
the
sentence.
"The
date?"
asked
Holmes,
opening
his
note
book.
"He
disappeared
upon
the
3d
of
December,
1878,
nearly
ten
years
ago."
"His
luggage?"
"Remained
at
the
hotel.
There
was
nothing
in
it
to
suggest
a
clue,
some
clothes,
some
books,
and
a
considerable
number
of
curiosities
from
the
Andaman
Islands.
He
had
been
one
of
the
officers
in
charge
of
the
convict
guard
there."
"Had
he
any
friends
in
town?"
"Only
one
that
we
know
of,
Major
Sholto,
of
his
own
regiment,
the
34th
Bombay
Infantry.
The
major
had
retired
some
little
time
before,
and
lived
at
Upper
Norwood.
We
communicated
with
him,
of
course,
but
he
did
not
even
know
that
his
brother
officer
was
in
England."
"A
singular
case,"
remarked
Holmes.
"I
have
not
yet
described
to
you
the
most
singular
part.
About
six
years
ago
to
be
exact,
upon
the
4th
of
May,
1882
an
advertisement
appeared
in
the
Times
asking
for
the
address
of
Miss
Mary
Morstan
and
stating
that
it
would
be
to
her
advantage
to
come
forward.
There
was
no
name
or
address
appended.
I
had
at
that
time
just
entered
the
family
of
Mrs.
Cecil
Forrester
in
the
capacity
of
governess.
By
her
advice
I
published
my
address
in
the
advertisement
column.
The
same
day
there
arrived
through
the
post
a
small
card
board
box
addressed
to
me,
which
I
found
to
contain
a
very
large
and
lustrous
pearl.
No
word
of
writing
was
enclosed.
Since
then
every
year
upon
the
same
date
there
has
always
appeared
a
similar
box,
containing
a
similar
pearl,
without
any
clue
as
to
the
sender.
They
have
been
pronounced
by
an
expert
to
be
of
a
rare
variety
and
of
considerable
value.
You
can
see
for
yourselves
that
they
are
very
handsome."
She
opened
a
flat
box
as
she
spoke,
and
showed
me
six
of
the
finest
pearls
that
I
had
ever
seen.
"Your
statement
is
most
interesting,"
said
Sherlock
Holmes.
"Has
anything
else
occurred
to
you?"
"Yes,
and
no
later
than
to
day.
That
is
why
I
have
come
to
you.
This
morning
I
received
this
letter,
which
you
will
perhaps
read
for
yourself."
"Thank
you,"
said
Holmes.
"The
envelope
too,
please.
