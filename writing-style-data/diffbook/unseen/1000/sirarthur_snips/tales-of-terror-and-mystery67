But
in
spite
of
his
melancholy
bearing
and
despondent
expression,
there
were
few
who
could
say
that
they
had
ever
seen
a
man
of
more
distinguished
presence.
Bowing
to
the
judge,
he
asked
if
he
might
be
allowed
to
make
a
statement,
and
having
been
duly
informed
that
whatever
he
said
might
be
used
against
him,
he
bowed
once
more,
and
proceeded:
"My
wish,"
said
he,
"is
to
hold
nothing
back,
but
to
tell
with
perfect
frankness
all
that
occurred
upon
the
night
of
the
21st
of
June.
Had
I
known
that
the
innocent
had
suffered,
and
that
so
much
trouble
had
been
brought
upon
those
whom
I
love
best
in
the
world,
I
should
have
come
forward
long
ago;
but
there
were
reasons
which
prevented
these
things
from
coming
to
my
ears.
It
was
my
desire
that
an
unhappy
man
should
vanish
from
the
world
which
had
known
him,
but
I
had
not
foreseen
that
others
would
be
affected
by
my
actions.
Let
me
to
the
best
of
my
ability
repair
the
evil
which
I
have
done.
"To
anyone
who
is
acquainted
with
the
history
of
the
Argentine
Republic
the
name
of
Lana
is
well
known.
My
father,
who
came
of
the
best
blood
of
old
Spain,
filled
all
the
highest
offices
of
the
State,
and
would
have
been
President
but
for
his
death
in
the
riots
of
San
Juan.
A
brilliant
career
might
have
been
open
to
my
twin
brother
Ernest
and
myself
had
it
not
been
for
financial
losses
which
made
it
necessary
that
we
should
earn
our
own
living.
I
apologize,
sir,
if
these
details
appear
to
be
irrelevant,
but
they
are
a
necessary
introduction
to
that
which
is
to
follow.
"I
had,
as
I
have
said,
a
twin
brother
named
Ernest,
whose
resemblance
to
me
was
so
great
that
even
when
we
were
together
people
could
see
no
difference
between
us.
Down
to
the
smallest
detail
we
were
exactly
the
same.
As
we
grew
older
this
likeness
became
less
marked
because
our
expression
was
not
the
same,
but
with
our
features
in
repose
the
points
of
difference
were
very
slight.
"It
does
not
become
me
to
say
too
much
of
one
who
is
dead,
the
more
so
as
he
is
my
only
brother,
but
I
leave
his
character
to
those
who
knew
him
best.
I
will
only
say
for
I
HAVE
to
say
it
that
in
my
early
manhood
I
conceived
a
horror
of
him,
and
that
I
had
good
reason
for
the
aversion
which
filled
me.
My
own
reputation
suffered
from
his
actions,
for
our
close
resemblance
caused
me
to
be
credited
with
many
of
them.
Eventually,
in
a
peculiarly
disgraceful
business,
he
contrived
to
throw
the
whole
odium
upon
me
in
such
a
way
that
I
was
forced
to
leave
the
Argentine
for
ever,
and
to
seek
a
career
in
Europe.
The
freedom
from
his
hated
presence
more
than
compensated
me
for
the
loss
of
my
native
land.
I
had
enough
money
to
defray
my
medical
studies
at
Glasgow,
and
I
finally
settled
in
practice
at
Bishop's
Crossing,
in
the
firm
conviction
that
in
that
remote
Lancashire
hamlet
I
should
never
hear
of
him
again.
"For
years
my
hopes
were
fulfilled,
and
then
at
last
he
discovered
me.
Some
Liverpool
man
who
visited
Buenos
Ayres
put
him
upon
my
track.
He
had
lost
all
his
money,
and
he
thought
that
he
would
come
over
and
share
mine.
Knowing
my
horror
of
him,
he
rightly
thought
that
I
would
be
willing
to
buy
him
off.
I
received
a
letter
from
him
saying
that
he
was
coming.
It
was
at
a
crisis
in
my
own
affairs,
and
his
arrival
might
conceivably
bring
trouble,
and
even
disgrace,
upon
some
whom
I
was
especially
bound
to
shield
from
anything
of
the
kind.
I
took
steps
to
insure
that
any
evil
which
might
come
should
fall
on
me
only,
and
that"
here
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
prisoner
"was
the
cause
of
conduct
upon
my
part
which
has
been
too
harshly
judged.
My
only
motive
was
to
screen
those
who
were
dear
to
me
from
any
possible
connection
with
scandal
or
disgrace.
That
scandal
and
disgrace
would
come
with
my
brother
was
only
to
say
that
what
had
been
would
be
again.
"My
brother
arrived
himself
one
night
not
very
long
after
my
receipt
of
the
letter.
I
was
sitting
in
my
study
after
the
servants
had
gone
to
bed,
when
I
heard
a
footstep
upon
the
gravel
outside,
and
an
instant
later
I
saw
his
face
looking
in
at
me
through
the
window.
He
was
a
clean
shaven
man
like
myself,
and
the
resemblance
between
us
was
still
so
great
that,
for
an
instant,
I
thought
it
was
my
own
reflection
in
the
glass.
He
had
a
dark
patch
over
his
eye,
but
our
features
were
absolutely
the
same.
Then
he
smiled
in
a
sardonic
way
which
had
been
a
trick
of
his
from
his
boyhood,
and
I
knew
that
he
was
the
same
brother
who
had
driven
me
from
my
native
land,
and
brought
disgrace
upon
what
had
been
an
honourable
name.
I
went
to
the
door
and
I
admitted
him.
That
would
be
about
ten
o'clock
that
night.
"When
he
came
into
the
glare
of
the
lamp,
I
saw
at
once
that
he
had
fallen
upon
very
evil
days.
He
had
walked
from
Liverpool,
and
he
was
tired
and
ill.
I
was
quite
shocked
by
the
expression
upon
his
face.
My
medical
knowledge
told
me
that
there
was
some
serious
internal
malady.
He
had
been
drinking
also,
and
his
face
was
bruised
as
the
result
of
a
scuffle
which
he
had
had
with
some
sailors.
It
was
to
cover
his
injured
eye
that
he
wore
this
patch,
which
he
removed
when
he
entered
the
room.
He
was
himself
dressed
in
a
pea
jacket
and
flannel
shirt,
and
his
feet
were
bursting
through
his
boots.
But
his
poverty
had
only
made
him
more
savagely
vindictive
