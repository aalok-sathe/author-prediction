my
bills,
or
to
cash
any
further
post
obits
upon
an
unentailed
property.
Ruin
lay
right
across
my
path,
and
every
day
I
saw
it
clearer,
nearer,
and
more
absolutely
unavoidable.
What
made
me
feel
my
own
poverty
the
more
was
that,
apart
from
the
great
wealth
of
Lord
Southerton,
all
my
other
relations
were
fairly
well
to
do.
The
nearest
of
these
was
Everard
King,
my
father's
nephew
and
my
own
first
cousin,
who
had
spent
an
adventurous
life
in
Brazil,
and
had
now
returned
to
this
country
to
settle
down
on
his
fortune.
We
never
knew
how
he
made
his
money,
but
he
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
it,
for
he
bought
the
estate
of
Greylands,
near
Clipton
on
the
Marsh,
in
Suffolk.
For
the
first
year
of
his
residence
in
England
he
took
no
more
notice
of
me
than
my
miserly
uncle;
but
at
last
one
summer
morning,
to
my
very
great
relief
and
joy,
I
received
a
letter
asking
me
to
come
down
that
very
day
and
spend
a
short
visit
at
Greylands
Court.
I
was
expecting
a
rather
long
visit
to
Bankruptcy
Court
at
the
time,
and
this
interruption
seemed
almost
providential.
If
I
could
only
get
on
terms
with
this
unknown
relative
of
mine,
I
might
pull
through
yet.
For
the
family
credit
he
could
not
let
me
go
entirely
to
the
wall.
I
ordered
my
valet
to
pack
my
valise,
and
I
set
off
the
same
evening
for
Clipton
on
the
Marsh.
After
changing
at
Ipswich,
a
little
local
train
deposited
me
at
a
small,
deserted
station
lying
amidst
a
rolling
grassy
country,
with
a
sluggish
and
winding
river
curving
in
and
out
amidst
the
valleys,
between
high,
silted
banks,
which
showed
that
we
were
within
reach
of
the
tide.
No
carriage
was
awaiting
me
(I
found
afterwards
that
my
telegram
had
been
delayed),
so
I
hired
a
dogcart
at
the
local
inn.
The
driver,
an
excellent
fellow,
was
full
of
my
relative's
praises,
and
I
learned
from
him
that
Mr.
Everard
King
was
already
a
name
to
conjure
with
in
that
part
of
the
county.
He
had
entertained
the
school
children,
he
had
thrown
his
grounds
open
to
visitors,
he
had
subscribed
to
charities
in
short,
his
benevolence
had
been
so
universal
that
my
driver
could
only
account
for
it
on
the
supposition
that
he
had
parliamentary
ambitions.
My
attention
was
drawn
away
from
my
driver's
panegyric
by
the
appearance
of
a
very
beautiful
bird
which
settled
on
a
telegraph
post
beside
the
road.
At
first
I
thought
that
it
was
a
jay,
but
it
was
larger,
with
a
brighter
plumage.
The
driver
accounted
for
its
presence
at
once
by
saying
that
it
belonged
to
the
very
man
whom
we
were
about
to
visit.
It
seems
that
the
acclimatization
of
foreign
creatures
was
one
of
his
hobbies,
and
that
he
had
brought
with
him
from
Brazil
a
number
of
birds
and
beasts
which
he
was
endeavouring
to
rear
in
England.
When
once
we
had
passed
the
gates
of
Greylands
Park
we
had
ample
evidence
of
this
taste
of
his.
Some
small
spotted
deer,
a
curious
wild
pig
known,
I
believe,
as
a
peccary,
a
gorgeously
feathered
oriole,
some
sort
of
armadillo,
and
a
singular
lumbering
in
toed
beast
like
a
very
fat
badger,
were
among
the
creatures
which
I
observed
as
we
drove
along
the
winding
avenue.
Mr.
Everard
King,
my
unknown
cousin,
was
standing
in
person
upon
the
steps
of
his
house,
for
he
had
seen
us
in
the
distance,
and
guessed
that
it
was
I.
His
appearance
was
very
homely
and
benevolent,
short
and
stout,
forty
five
years
old,
perhaps,
with
a
round,
good
humoured
face,
burned
brown
with
the
tropical
sun,
and
shot
with
a
thousand
wrinkles.
He
wore
white
linen
clothes,
in
true
planter
style,
with
a
cigar
between
his
lips,
and
a
large
Panama
hat
upon
the
back
of
his
head.
It
was
such
a
figure
as
one
associates
with
a
verandahed
bungalow,
and
it
looked
curiously
out
of
place
in
front
of
this
broad,
stone
English
mansion,
with
its
solid
wings
and
its
Palladio
pillars
before
the
doorway.
"My
dear!"
he
cried,
glancing
over
his
shoulder;
"my
dear,
here
is
our
guest!
Welcome,
welcome
to
Greylands!
I
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance,
Cousin
Marshall,
and
I
take
it
as
a
great
compliment
that
you
should
honour
this
sleepy
little
country
place
with
your
presence."
Nothing
could
be
more
hearty
than
his
manner,
and
he
set
me
at
my
ease
in
an
instant.
But
it
needed
all
his
cordiality
to
atone
for
the
frigidity
and
even
rudeness
of
his
wife,
a
tall,
haggard
woman,
who
came
forward
at
his
summons.
She
was,
I
believe,
of
Brazilian
extraction,
though
she
spoke
excellent
English,
and
I
excused
her
manners
on
the
score
of
her
ignorance
of
our
customs.
She
did
not
attempt
to
conceal,
however,
either
then
or
afterwards,
that
I
was
no
very
welcome
visitor
at
Greylands
Court.
Her
actual
words
were,
as
a
rule,
courteous,
but
she
was
the
possessor
of
a
pair
of
particularly
expressive
dark
eyes,
and
I
read
in
them
very
clearly
from
the
first
that
she
heartily
wished
me
back
in
London
once
more.
However,
my
debts
were
too
pressing
and
my
designs
upon
my
wealthy
relative
were
too
vital
for
me
to
allow
them
to
be
upset
by
the
ill
temper
of
his
wife,
so
I
disregarded
her
coldness
and
reciprocated
the
extreme
cordiality
of
his
welcome.
No
pains
had
been
spared
by
him
to
make
me
comfortable.
My
room
was
a
charming
one.
He
implored
me
to
tell
him
anything
which
could
add
to
my
happiness.
It
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
inform
him
that
a
blank
cheque
would
materially
help
towards
that
end,
but
I
felt
that
it
might
be
premature
in
the
present
state
of
our
acquaintance.
The
dinner
was
excellent,
and
as
we
sat
together
afterwards
over
his
Havanas
and
coffee,
which
later
he
