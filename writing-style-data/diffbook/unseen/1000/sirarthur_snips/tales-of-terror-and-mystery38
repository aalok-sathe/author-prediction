later
a
third,
more
bewildering
"Presume
some
mistake
as
to
proposed
running
of
special.
Local
train
from
St.
Helens
timed
to
follow
it
has
just
arrived
and
has
seen
nothing
of
it.
Kindly
wire
advices.
Manchester."
The
matter
was
assuming
a
most
amazing
aspect,
although
in
some
respects
the
last
telegram
was
a
relief
to
the
authorities
at
Liverpool.
If
an
accident
had
occurred
to
the
special,
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
the
local
train
could
have
passed
down
the
same
line
without
observing
it.
And
yet,
what
was
the
alternative?
Where
could
the
train
be?
Had
it
possibly
been
sidetracked
for
some
reason
in
order
to
allow
the
slower
train
to
go
past?
Such
an
explanation
was
possible
if
some
small
repair
had
to
be
effected.
A
telegram
was
dispatched
to
each
of
the
stations
between
St.
Helens
and
Manchester,
and
the
superintendent
and
traffic
manager
waited
in
the
utmost
suspense
at
the
instrument
for
the
series
of
replies
which
would
enable
them
to
say
for
certain
what
had
become
of
the
missing
train.
The
answers
came
back
in
the
order
of
questions,
which
was
the
order
of
the
stations
beginning
at
the
St.
Helens
end
"Special
passed
here
five
o'clock.
Collins
Green."
"Special
passed
here
six
past
five.
Earlstown."
"Special
passed
here
5:10.
Newton."
"Special
passed
here
5:20.
Kenyon
Junction."
"No
special
train
has
passed
here.
Barton
Moss."
The
two
officials
stared
at
each
other
in
amazement.
"This
is
unique
in
my
thirty
years
of
experience,"
said
Mr.
Bland.
"Absolutely
unprecedented
and
inexplicable,
sir.
The
special
has
gone
wrong
between
Kenyon
Junction
and
Barton
Moss."
"And
yet
there
is
no
siding,
so
far
as
my
memory
serves
me,
between
the
two
stations.
The
special
must
have
run
off
the
metals."
"But
how
could
the
four
fifty
parliamentary
pass
over
the
same
line
without
observing
it?"
"There's
no
alternative,
Mr.
Hood.
It
must
be
so.
Possibly
the
local
train
may
have
observed
something
which
may
throw
some
light
upon
the
matter.
We
will
wire
to
Manchester
for
more
information,
and
to
Kenyon
Junction
with
instructions
that
the
line
be
examined
instantly
as
far
as
Barton
Moss."
The
answer
from
Manchester
came
within
a
few
minutes.
"No
news
of
missing
special.
Driver
and
guard
of
slow
train
positive
no
accident
between
Kenyon
Junction
and
Barton
Moss.
Line
quite
clear,
and
no
sign
of
anything
unusual.
Manchester."
"That
driver
and
guard
will
have
to
go,"
said
Mr.
Bland,
grimly.
"There
has
been
a
wreck
and
they
have
missed
it.
The
special
has
obviously
run
off
the
metals
without
disturbing
the
line
how
it
could
have
done
so
passes
my
comprehension
but
so
it
must
be,
and
we
shall
have
a
wire
from
Kenyon
or
Barton
Moss
presently
to
say
that
they
have
found
her
at
the
bottom
of
an
embankment."
But
Mr.
Bland's
prophecy
was
not
destined
to
be
fulfilled.
Half
an
hour
passed,
and
then
there
arrived
the
following
message
from
the
station
master
of
Kenyon
Junction
"There
are
no
traces
of
the
missing
special.
It
is
quite
certain
that
she
passed
here,
and
that
she
did
not
arrive
at
Barton
Moss.
We
have
detached
engine
from
goods
train,
and
I
have
myself
ridden
down
the
line,
but
all
is
clear,
and
there
is
no
sign
of
any
accident."
Mr.
Bland
tore
his
hair
in
his
perplexity.
"This
is
rank
lunacy,
Hood!"
he
cried.
"Does
a
train
vanish
into
thin
air
in
England
in
broad
daylight?
The
thing
is
preposterous.
An
engine,
a
tender,
two
carriages,
a
van,
five
human
beings
and
all
lost
on
a
straight
line
of
railway!
Unless
we
get
something
positive
within
the
next
hour
I'll
take
Inspector
Collins,
and
go
down
myself."
And
then
at
last
something
positive
did
occur.
It
took
the
shape
of
another
telegram
from
Kenyon
Junction.
"Regret
to
report
that
the
dead
body
of
John
Slater,
driver
of
the
special
train,
has
just
been
found
among
the
gorse
bushes
at
a
point
two
and
a
quarter
miles
from
the
Junction.
Had
fallen
from
his
engine,
pitched
down
the
embankment,
and
rolled
among
the
bushes.
Injuries
to
his
head,
from
the
fall,
appear
to
be
cause
of
death.
Ground
has
now
been
carefully
examined,
and
there
is
no
trace
of
the
missing
train."
The
country
was,
as
has
already
been
stated,
in
the
throes
of
a
political
crisis,
and
the
attention
of
the
public
was
further
distracted
by
the
important
and
sensational
developments
in
Paris,
where
a
huge
scandal
threatened
to
destroy
the
Government
and
to
wreck
the
reputations
of
many
of
the
leading
men
in
France.
The
papers
were
full
of
these
events,
and
the
singular
disappearance
of
the
special
train
attracted
less
attention
than
would
have
been
the
case
in
more
peaceful
times.
The
grotesque
nature
of
the
event
helped
to
detract
from
its
importance,
for
the
papers
were
disinclined
to
believe
the
facts
as
reported
to
them.
More
than
one
of
the
London
journals
treated
the
matter
as
an
ingenious
hoax,
until
the
coroner's
inquest
upon
the
unfortunate
driver
(an
inquest
which
elicited
nothing
of
importance)
convinced
them
of
the
tragedy
of
the
incident.
Mr.
Bland,
accompanied
by
Inspector
Collins,
the
senior
detective
officer
in
the
service
of
the
company,
went
down
to
Kenyon
Junction
the
same
evening,
and
their
research
lasted
throughout
the
following
day,
but
was
attended
with
purely
negative
results.
Not
only
was
no
trace
found
of
the
missing
train,
but
no
conjecture
could
be
put
forward
which
could
possibly
explain
the
facts.
At
the
same
time,
Inspector
Collins's
official
report
(which
lies
before
me
as
I
write)
served
to
show
that
the
possibilities
were
more
numerous
than
might
have
been
expected.
"In
the
stretch
of
railway
between
these
two
points,"
said
he,
"the
country
is
dotted
with
ironworks
and
collieries.
Of
these,
some
are
being
worked
and
some
have
been
abandoned.
There
are
no
fewer
than
twelve
which
have
small
gauge
lines
which
run
trolly
cars
down
to
the
main
line.
These
can,
of
course,
