I
had
waited,
now
that
it
had
actually
come
I
was
unprepared
for
the
shock.
I
lay
motionless
and
breathless,
whilst
the
great
dark
mass
whisked
by
me
and
was
swallowed
up
in
the
night.
But
now
I
nerved
myself
for
its
return.
No
sound
came
from
the
sleeping
countryside
to
tell
of
the
horror
which
was
loose.
In
no
way
could
I
judge
how
far
off
it
was,
what
it
was
doing,
or
when
it
might
be
back.
But
not
a
second
time
should
my
nerve
fail
me,
not
a
second
time
should
it
pass
unchallenged.
I
swore
it
between
my
clenched
teeth
as
I
laid
my
cocked
rifle
across
the
rock.
And
yet
it
nearly
happened.
There
was
no
warning
of
approach
now
as
the
creature
passed
over
the
grass.
Suddenly,
like
a
dark,
drifting
shadow,
the
huge
bulk
loomed
up
once
more
before
me,
making
for
the
entrance
of
the
cave.
Again
came
that
paralysis
of
volition
which
held
my
crooked
forefinger
impotent
upon
the
trigger.
But
with
a
desperate
effort
I
shook
it
off.
Even
as
the
brushwood
rustled,
and
the
monstrous
beast
blended
with
the
shadow
of
the
Gap,
I
fired
at
the
retreating
form.
In
the
blaze
of
the
gun
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
great
shaggy
mass,
something
with
rough
and
bristling
hair
of
a
withered
grey
colour,
fading
away
to
white
in
its
lower
parts,
the
huge
body
supported
upon
short,
thick,
curving
legs.
I
had
just
that
glance,
and
then
I
heard
the
rattle
of
the
stones
as
the
creature
tore
down
into
its
burrow.
In
an
instant,
with
a
triumphant
revulsion
of
feeling,
I
had
cast
my
fears
to
the
wind,
and
uncovering
my
powerful
lantern,
with
my
rifle
in
my
hand,
I
sprang
down
from
my
rock
and
rushed
after
the
monster
down
the
old
Roman
shaft.
My
splendid
lamp
cast
a
brilliant
flood
of
vivid
light
in
front
of
me,
very
different
from
the
yellow
glimmer
which
had
aided
me
down
the
same
passage
only
twelve
days
before.
As
I
ran,
I
saw
the
great
beast
lurching
along
before
me,
its
huge
bulk
filling
up
the
whole
space
from
wall
to
wall.
Its
hair
looked
like
coarse
faded
oakum,
and
hung
down
in
long,
dense
masses
which
swayed
as
it
moved.
It
was
like
an
enormous
unclipped
sheep
in
its
fleece,
but
in
size
it
was
far
larger
than
the
largest
elephant,
and
its
breadth
seemed
to
be
nearly
as
great
as
its
height.
It
fills
me
with
amazement
now
to
think
that
I
should
have
dared
to
follow
such
a
horror
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth,
but
when
one's
blood
is
up,
and
when
one's
quarry
seems
to
be
flying,
the
old
primeval
hunting
spirit
awakes
and
prudence
is
cast
to
the
wind.
Rifle
in
hand,
I
ran
at
the
top
of
my
speed
upon
the
trail
of
the
monster.
I
had
seen
that
the
creature
was
swift.
Now
I
was
to
find
out
to
my
cost
that
it
was
also
very
cunning.
I
had
imagined
that
it
was
in
panic
flight,
and
that
I
had
only
to
pursue
it.
The
idea
that
it
might
turn
upon
me
never
entered
my
excited
brain.
I
have
already
explained
that
the
passage
down
which
I
was
racing
opened
into
a
great
central
cave.
Into
this
I
rushed,
fearful
lest
I
should
lose
all
trace
of
the
beast.
But
he
had
turned
upon
his
own
traces,
and
in
a
moment
we
were
face
to
face.
That
picture,
seen
in
the
brilliant
white
light
of
the
lantern,
is
etched
for
ever
upon
my
brain.
He
had
reared
up
on
his
hind
legs
as
a
bear
would
do,
and
stood
above
me,
enormous,
menacing
such
a
creature
as
no
nightmare
had
ever
brought
to
my
imagination.
I
have
said
that
he
reared
like
a
bear,
and
there
was
something
bear
like
if
one
could
conceive
a
bear
which
was
ten
fold
the
bulk
of
any
bear
seen
upon
earth
in
his
whole
pose
and
attitude,
in
his
great
crooked
forelegs
with
their
ivory
white
claws,
in
his
rugged
skin,
and
in
his
red,
gaping
mouth,
fringed
with
monstrous
fangs.
Only
in
one
point
did
he
differ
from
the
bear,
or
from
any
other
creature
which
walks
the
earth,
and
even
at
that
supreme
moment
a
shudder
of
horror
passed
over
me
as
I
observed
that
the
eyes
which
glistened
in
the
glow
of
my
lantern
were
huge,
projecting
bulbs,
white
and
sightless.
For
a
moment
his
great
paws
swung
over
my
head.
The
next
he
fell
forward
upon
me,
I
and
my
broken
lantern
crashed
to
the
earth,
and
I
remember
no
more.
When
I
came
to
myself
I
was
back
in
the
farm
house
of
the
Allertons.
Two
days
had
passed
since
my
terrible
adventure
in
the
Blue
John
Gap.
It
seems
that
I
had
lain
all
night
in
the
cave
insensible
from
concussion
of
the
brain,
with
my
left
arm
and
two
ribs
badly
fractured.
In
the
morning
my
note
had
been
found,
a
search
party
of
a
dozen
farmers
assembled,
and
I
had
been
tracked
down
and
carried
back
to
my
bedroom,
where
I
had
lain
in
high
delirium
ever
since.
There
was,
it
seems,
no
sign
of
the
creature,
and
no
bloodstain
which
would
show
that
my
bullet
had
found
him
as
he
passed.
Save
for
my
own
plight
and
the
marks
upon
the
mud,
there
was
nothing
to
prove
that
what
I
said
was
true.
Six
weeks
have
now
elapsed,
and
I
am
able
to
sit
out
once
more
in
the
sunshine.
Just
opposite
me
is
the
steep
hillside,
grey
with
shaly
rock,
and
yonder
on
its
flank
is
the
dark
cleft
which
marks
the
opening
of
the
Blue
John
Gap.
But
it
is
no
longer
a
source
of
terror.
Never
again
through
that
ill
omened
tunnel
shall
any
strange
shape
flit
out
into
the
world
of
men.
