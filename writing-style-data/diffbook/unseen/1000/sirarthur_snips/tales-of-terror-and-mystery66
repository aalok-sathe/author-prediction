not
feel
that
she
had
any
grievance
whatever
against
Dr.
Lana,
and
that
in
her
opinion
he
had
acted
in
a
perfectly
honourable
manner.
Her
brother,
on
an
insufficient
knowledge
of
the
facts,
had
taken
another
view,
and
she
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
that,
in
spite
of
her
entreaties,
he
had
uttered
threats
of
personal
violence
against
the
doctor,
and
had,
upon
the
evening
of
the
tragedy,
announced
his
intention
of
"having
it
out
with
him."
She
had
done
her
best
to
bring
him
to
a
more
reasonable
frame
of
mind,
but
he
was
very
headstrong
where
his
emotions
or
prejudices
were
concerned.
Up
to
this
point
the
young
lady's
evidence
had
appeared
to
make
against
the
prisoner
rather
than
in
his
favour.
The
questions
of
her
counsel,
however,
soon
put
a
very
different
light
upon
the
matter,
and
disclosed
an
unexpected
line
of
defence.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Do
you
believe
your
brother
to
be
guilty
of
this
crime?
The
Judge:
I
cannot
permit
that
question,
Mr.
Humphrey.
We
are
here
to
decide
upon
questions
of
fact
not
of
belief.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Do
you
know
that
your
brother
is
not
guilty
of
the
death
of
Doctor
Lana?
Miss
Morton:
Yes.
Mr.
Humphrey:
How
do
you
know
it?
Miss
Morton:
Because
Dr.
Lana
is
not
dead.
There
followed
a
prolonged
sensation
in
court,
which
interrupted
the
examination
of
the
witness.
Mr.
Humphrey:
And
how
do
you
know,
Miss
Morton,
that
Dr.
Lana
is
not
dead?
Miss
Morton:
Because
I
have
received
a
letter
from
him
since
the
date
of
his
supposed
death.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Have
you
this
letter?
Miss
Morton:
Yes,
but
I
should
prefer
not
to
show
it.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Have
you
the
envelope?
Miss
Morton:
Yes,
it
is
here.
Mr.
Humphrey:
What
is
the
post
mark?
Miss
Morton:
Liverpool.
Mr.
Humphrey:
And
the
date?
Miss
Morton:
June
the
22nd.
Mr.
Humphrey:
That
being
the
day
after
his
alleged
death.
Are
you
prepared
to
swear
to
this
handwriting,
Miss
Morton?
Miss
Morton:
Certainly.
Mr.
Humphrey:
I
am
prepared
to
call
six
other
witnesses,
my
lord,
to
testify
that
this
letter
is
in
the
writing
of
Doctor
Lana.
The
Judge:
Then
you
must
call
them
tomorrow.
Mr.
Porlock
Carr
(counsel
for
the
prosecution):
In
the
meantime,
my
lord,
we
claim
possession
of
this
document,
so
that
we
may
obtain
expert
evidence
as
to
how
far
it
is
an
imitation
of
the
handwriting
of
the
gentleman
whom
we
still
confidently
assert
to
be
deceased.
I
need
not
point
out
that
the
theory
so
unexpectedly
sprung
upon
us
may
prove
to
be
a
very
obvious
device
adopted
by
the
friends
of
the
prisoner
in
order
to
divert
this
inquiry.
I
would
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
young
lady
must,
according
to
her
own
account,
have
possessed
this
letter
during
the
proceedings
at
the
inquest
and
at
the
police
court.
She
desires
us
to
believe
that
she
permitted
these
to
proceed,
although
she
held
in
her
pocket
evidence
which
would
at
any
moment
have
brought
them
to
an
end.
Mr.
Humphrey.
Can
you
explain
this,
Miss
Morton?
Miss
Morton:
Dr.
Lana
desired
his
secret
to
be
preserved.
Mr.
Porlock
Carr:
Then
why
have
you
made
this
public?
Miss
Morton:
To
save
my
brother.
A
murmur
of
sympathy
broke
out
in
court,
which
was
instantly
suppressed
by
the
Judge.
The
Judge:
Admitting
this
line
of
defence,
it
lies
with
you,
Mr.
Humphrey,
to
throw
a
light
upon
who
this
man
is
whose
body
has
been
recognized
by
so
many
friends
and
patients
of
Dr.
Lana
as
being
that
of
the
doctor
himself.
A
Juryman:
Has
anyone
up
to
now
expressed
any
doubt
about
the
matter?
Mr.
Porlock
Carr:
Not
to
my
knowledge.
Mr.
Humphrey:
We
hope
to
make
the
matter
clear.
The
Judge:
Then
the
court
adjourns
until
tomorrow.
This
new
development
of
the
case
excited
the
utmost
interest
among
the
general
public.
Press
comment
was
prevented
by
the
fact
that
the
trial
was
still
undecided,
but
the
question
was
everywhere
argued
as
to
how
far
there
could
be
truth
in
Miss
Morton's
declaration,
and
how
far
it
might
be
a
daring
ruse
for
the
purpose
of
saving
her
brother.
The
obvious
dilemma
in
which
the
missing
doctor
stood
was
that
if
by
any
extraordinary
chance
he
was
not
dead,
then
he
must
be
held
responsible
for
the
death
of
this
unknown
man,
who
resembled
him
so
exactly,
and
who
was
found
in
his
study.
This
letter
which
Miss
Morton
refused
to
produce
was
possibly
a
confession
of
guilt,
and
she
might
find
herself
in
the
terrible
position
of
only
being
able
to
save
her
brother
from
the
gallows
by
the
sacrifice
of
her
former
lover.
The
court
next
morning
was
crammed
to
overflowing,
and
a
murmur
of
excitement
passed
over
it
when
Mr.
Humphrey
was
observed
to
enter
in
a
state
of
emotion,
which
even
his
trained
nerves
could
not
conceal,
and
to
confer
with
the
opposing
counsel.
A
few
hurried
words
words
which
left
a
look
of
amazement
upon
Mr.
Porlock
Carr's
face
passed
between
them,
and
then
the
counsel
for
the
defence,
addressing
the
Judge,
announced
that,
with
the
consent
of
the
prosecution,
the
young
lady
who
had
given
evidence
upon
the
sitting
before
would
not
be
recalled.
The
Judge:
But
you
appear,
Mr.
Humphrey,
to
have
left
matters
in
a
very
unsatisfactory
state.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Perhaps,
my
lord,
my
next
witness
may
help
to
clear
them
up.
The
Judge:
Then
call
your
next
witness.
Mr.
Humphrey:
I
call
Dr.
Aloysius
Lana.
The
learned
counsel
has
made
many
telling
remarks
in
his
day,
but
he
has
certainly
never
produced
such
a
sensation
with
so
short
a
sentence.
The
court
was
simply
stunned
with
amazement
as
the
very
man
whose
fate
had
been
the
subject
of
so
much
contention
appeared
bodily
before
them
in
the
witness
box.
Those
among
the
spectators
who
had
known
him
at
Bishop's
Crossing
saw
him
now,
gaunt
and
thin,
with
deep
lines
of
care
upon
his
face.
