fleeced
of
a
large
sum
by
two
confederate
card
sharpers,
and
the
matter
was
in
the
hands
of
Scotland
Yard.
The
first
I
learned
of
it
was
in
the
evening
paper,
and
I
was
at
once
certain
that
my
brother
and
MacCoy
were
back
at
their
old
games.
I
hurried
at
once
to
Edward's
lodgings.
They
told
me
that
he
and
a
tall
gentleman
(whom
I
recognized
as
MacCoy)
had
gone
off
together,
and
that
he
had
left
the
lodgings
and
taken
his
things
with
him.
The
landlady
had
heard
them
give
several
directions
to
the
cabman,
ending
with
Euston
Station,
and
she
had
accidentally
overheard
the
tall
gentleman
saying
something
about
Manchester.
She
believed
that
that
was
their
destination.
"A
glance
at
the
time
table
showed
me
that
the
most
likely
train
was
at
five,
though
there
was
another
at
4:35
which
they
might
have
caught.
I
had
only
time
to
get
the
later
one,
but
found
no
sign
of
them
either
at
the
depot
or
in
the
train.
They
must
have
gone
on
by
the
earlier
one,
so
I
determined
to
follow
them
to
Manchester
and
search
for
them
in
the
hotels
there.
One
last
appeal
to
my
brother
by
all
that
he
owed
to
my
mother
might
even
now
be
the
salvation
of
him.
My
nerves
were
overstrung,
and
I
lit
a
cigar
to
steady
them.
At
that
moment,
just
as
the
train
was
moving
off,
the
door
of
my
compartment
was
flung
open,
and
there
were
MacCoy
and
my
brother
on
the
platform.
"They
were
both
disguised,
and
with
good
reason,
for
they
knew
that
the
London
police
were
after
them.
MacCoy
had
a
great
astrakhan
collar
drawn
up,
so
that
only
his
eyes
and
nose
were
showing.
My
brother
was
dressed
like
a
woman,
with
a
black
veil
half
down
his
face,
but
of
course
it
did
not
deceive
me
for
an
instant,
nor
would
it
have
done
so
even
if
I
had
not
known
that
he
had
often
used
such
a
dress
before.
I
started
up,
and
as
I
did
so
MacCoy
recognized
me.
He
said
something,
the
conductor
slammed
the
door,
and
they
were
shown
into
the
next
compartment.
I
tried
to
stop
the
train
so
as
to
follow
them,
but
the
wheels
were
already
moving,
and
it
was
too
late.
"When
we
stopped
at
Willesden,
I
instantly
changed
my
carriage.
It
appears
that
I
was
not
seen
to
do
so,
which
is
not
surprising,
as
the
station
was
crowded
with
people.
MacCoy,
of
course,
was
expecting
me,
and
he
had
spent
the
time
between
Euston
and
Willesden
in
saying
all
he
could
to
harden
my
brother's
heart
and
set
him
against
me.
That
is
what
I
fancy,
for
I
had
never
found
him
so
impossible
to
soften
or
to
move.
I
tried
this
way
and
I
tried
that;
I
pictured
his
future
in
an
English
gaol;
I
described
the
sorrow
of
his
mother
when
I
came
back
with
the
news;
I
said
everything
to
touch
his
heart,
but
all
to
no
purpose.
He
sat
there
with
a
fixed
sneer
upon
his
handsome
face,
while
every
now
and
then
Sparrow
MacCoy
would
throw
in
a
taunt
at
me,
or
some
word
of
encouragement
to
hold
my
brother
to
his
resolutions.
"'Why
don't
you
run
a
Sunday
school?'
he
would
say
to
me,
and
then,
in
the
same
breath:
'He
thinks
you
have
no
will
of
your
own.
He
thinks
you
are
just
the
baby
brother
and
that
he
can
lead
you
where
he
likes.
He's
only
just
finding
out
that
you
are
a
man
as
well
as
he.'
"It
was
those
words
of
his
which
set
me
talking
bitterly.
We
had
left
Willesden,
you
understand,
for
all
this
took
some
time.
My
temper
got
the
better
of
me,
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
let
my
brother
see
the
rough
side
of
me.
Perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
had
I
done
so
earlier
and
more
often.
"'A
man!'
said
I.
'Well,
I'm
glad
to
have
your
friend's
assurance
of
it,
for
no
one
would
suspect
it
to
see
you
like
a
boarding
school
missy.
I
don't
suppose
in
all
this
country
there
is
a
more
contemptible
looking
creature
than
you
are
as
you
sit
there
with
that
Dolly
pinafore
upon
you.'
He
coloured
up
at
that,
for
he
was
a
vain
man,
and
he
winced
from
ridicule.
"'It's
only
a
dust
cloak,'
said
he,
and
he
slipped
it
off.
'One
has
to
throw
the
coppers
off
one's
scent,
and
I
had
no
other
way
to
do
it.'
He
took
his
toque
off
with
the
veil
attached,
and
he
put
both
it
and
the
cloak
into
his
brown
bag.
'Anyway,
I
don't
need
to
wear
it
until
the
conductor
comes
round,'
said
he.
"'Nor
then,
either,'
said
I,
and
taking
the
bag
I
slung
it
with
all
my
force
out
of
the
window.
'Now,'
said
I,
'you'll
never
make
a
Mary
Jane
of
yourself
while
I
can
help
it.
If
nothing
but
that
disguise
stands
between
you
and
a
gaol,
then
to
gaol
you
shall
go.'
"That
was
the
way
to
manage
him.
I
felt
my
advantage
at
once.
His
supple
nature
was
one
which
yielded
to
roughness
far
more
readily
than
to
entreaty.
He
flushed
with
shame,
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears.
But
MacCoy
saw
my
advantage
also,
and
was
determined
that
I
should
not
pursue
it.
"'He's
my
pard,
and
you
shall
not
bully
him,'
he
cried.
"'He's
my
brother,
and
you
shall
not
ruin
him,'
said
I.
'I
believe
a
spell
of
prison
is
the
very
best
way
of
keeping
you
apart,
and
you
shall
have
it,
or
it
will
be
no
fault
of
mine.'
"'Oh,
you
would
squeal,
would
you?'
he
cried,
and
in
an
instant
he
whipped
out
his
revolver.
I
sprang
for
his
hand,
but
saw
that
I
was
too
late,
and
jumped
aside.
At
the
same
instant
he
fired,
and
the
bullet
