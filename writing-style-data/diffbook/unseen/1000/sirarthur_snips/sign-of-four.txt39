direction,
with
the
loud
breathing
of
a
running
man.
I
turned
my
lantern
down
the
long,
straight
passage,
and
there
was
the
fat
man,
running
like
the
wind,
with
a
smear
of
blood
across
his
face,
and
close
at
his
heels,
bounding
like
a
tiger,
the
great
black
bearded
Sikh,
with
a
knife
flashing
in
his
hand.
I
have
never
seen
a
man
run
so
fast
as
that
little
merchant.
He
was
gaining
on
the
Sikh,
and
I
could
see
that
if
he
once
passed
me
and
got
to
the
open
air
he
would
save
himself
yet.
My
heart
softened
to
him,
but
again
the
thought
of
his
treasure
turned
me
hard
and
bitter.
I
cast
my
firelock
between
his
legs
as
he
raced
past,
and
he
rolled
twice
over
like
a
shot
rabbit.
Ere
he
could
stagger
to
his
feet
the
Sikh
was
upon
him,
and
buried
his
knife
twice
in
his
side.
The
man
never
uttered
moan
nor
moved
muscle,
but
lay
were
he
had
fallen.
I
think
myself
that
he
may
have
broken
his
neck
with
the
fall.
You
see,
gentlemen,
that
I
am
keeping
my
promise.
I
am
telling
you
every
work
of
the
business
just
exactly
as
it
happened,
whether
it
is
in
my
favor
or
not."
He
stopped,
and
held
out
his
manacled
hands
for
the
whiskey
and
water
which
Holmes
had
brewed
for
him.
For
myself,
I
confess
that
I
had
now
conceived
the
utmost
horror
of
the
man,
not
only
for
this
cold
blooded
business
in
which
he
had
been
concerned,
but
even
more
for
the
somewhat
flippant
and
careless
way
in
which
he
narrated
it.
Whatever
punishment
was
in
store
for
him,
I
felt
that
he
might
expect
no
sympathy
from
me.
Sherlock
Holmes
and
Jones
sat
with
their
hands
upon
their
knees,
deeply
interested
in
the
story,
but
with
the
same
disgust
written
upon
their
faces.
He
may
have
observed
it,
for
there
was
a
touch
of
defiance
in
his
voice
and
manner
as
he
proceeded.
"It
was
all
very
bad,
no
doubt,"
said
he.
"I
should
like
to
know
how
many
fellows
in
my
shoes
would
have
refused
a
share
of
this
loot
when
they
knew
that
they
would
have
their
throats
cut
for
their
pains.
Besides,
it
was
my
life
or
his
when
once
he
was
in
the
fort.
If
he
had
got
out,
the
whole
business
would
come
to
light,
and
I
should
have
been
court
martialled
and
shot
as
likely
as
not;
for
people
were
not
very
lenient
at
a
time
like
that."
"Go
on
with
your
story,"
said
Holmes,
shortly.
"Well,
we
carried
him
in,
Abdullah,
Akbar,
and
I.
A
fine
weight
he
was,
too,
for
all
that
he
was
so
short.
Mahomet
Singh
was
left
to
guard
the
door.
We
took
him
to
a
place
which
the
Sikhs
had
already
prepared.
It
was
some
distance
off,
where
a
winding
passage
leads
to
a
great
empty
hall,
the
brick
walls
of
which
were
all
crumbling
to
pieces.
The
earth
floor
had
sunk
in
at
one
place,
making
a
natural
grave,
so
we
left
Achmet
the
merchant
there,
having
first
covered
him
over
with
loose
bricks.
This
done,
we
all
went
back
to
the
treasure.
"It
lay
where
he
had
dropped
it
when
he
was
first
attacked.
The
box
was
the
same
which
now
lies
open
upon
your
table.
A
key
was
hung
by
a
silken
cord
to
that
carved
handle
upon
the
top.
We
opened
it,
and
the
light
of
the
lantern
gleamed
upon
a
collection
of
gems
such
as
I
have
read
of
and
thought
about
when
I
was
a
little
lad
at
Pershore.
It
was
blinding
to
look
upon
them.
When
we
had
feasted
our
eyes
we
took
them
all
out
and
made
a
list
of
them.
There
were
one
hundred
and
forty
three
diamonds
of
the
first
water,
including
one
which
has
been
called,
I
believe,
'the
Great
Mogul'
and
is
said
to
be
the
second
largest
stone
in
existence.
Then
there
were
ninety
seven
very
fine
emeralds,
and
one
hundred
and
seventy
rubies,
some
of
which,
however,
were
small.
There
were
forty
carbuncles,
two
hundred
and
ten
sapphires,
sixty
one
agates,
and
a
great
quantity
of
beryls,
onyxes,
cats'
eyes,
turquoises,
and
other
stones,
the
very
names
of
which
I
did
not
know
at
the
time,
though
I
have
become
more
familiar
with
them
since.
Besides
this,
there
were
nearly
three
hundred
very
fine
pearls,
twelve
of
which
were
set
in
a
gold
coronet.
By
the
way,
these
last
had
been
taken
out
of
the
chest
and
were
not
there
when
I
recovered
it.
"After
we
had
counted
our
treasures
we
put
them
back
into
the
chest
and
carried
them
to
the
gate
way
to
show
them
to
Mahomet
Singh.
Then
we
solemnly
renewed
our
oath
to
stand
by
each
other
and
be
true
to
our
secret.
We
agreed
to
conceal
our
loot
in
a
safe
place
until
the
country
should
be
at
peace
again,
and
then
to
divide
it
equally
among
ourselves.
There
was
no
use
dividing
it
at
present,
for
if
gems
of
such
value
were
found
upon
us
it
would
cause
suspicion,
and
there
was
no
privacy
in
the
fort
nor
any
place
where
we
could
keep
them.
We
carried
the
box,
therefore,
into
the
same
hall
where
we
had
buried
the
body,
and
there,
under
certain
bricks
in
the
best
preserved
wall,
we
made
a
hollow
and
put
our
treasure.
We
made
careful
note
of
the
place,
and
next
day
I
drew
four
plans,
one
for
each
of
us,
and
put
the
sign
of
the
four
of
us
at
the
bottom,
for
we
had
sworn
that
we
should
each
always
act
for
all,
so
that
none
might
take
advantage.
That
is
an
oath
that
I
can
put
my
hand
to
my
heart
and
swear
that
I
have
never
broken.
"Well,
there's
no
use
my
telling
you
gentlemen
what
came
of
the
Indian
mutiny.
After
Wilson
took
Delhi
