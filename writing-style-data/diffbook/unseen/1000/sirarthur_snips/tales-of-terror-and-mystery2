"Nevertheless,
when
I
dined
at
Rheims
with
Coselli
and
Gustav
Raymond
I
found
that
neither
of
them
was
aware
of
any
particular
danger
in
the
higher
layers
of
the
atmosphere.
I
did
not
actually
say
what
was
in
my
thoughts,
but
I
got
so
near
to
it
that
if
they
had
any
corresponding
idea
they
could
not
have
failed
to
express
it.
But
then
they
are
two
empty,
vainglorious
fellows
with
no
thought
beyond
seeing
their
silly
names
in
the
newspaper.
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
neither
of
them
had
ever
been
much
beyond
the
twenty
thousand
foot
level.
Of
course,
men
have
been
higher
than
this
both
in
balloons
and
in
the
ascent
of
mountains.
It
must
be
well
above
that
point
that
the
aeroplane
enters
the
danger
zone
always
presuming
that
my
premonitions
are
correct.
"Aeroplaning
has
been
with
us
now
for
more
than
twenty
years,
and
one
might
well
ask:
Why
should
this
peril
be
only
revealing
itself
in
our
day?
The
answer
is
obvious.
In
the
old
days
of
weak
engines,
when
a
hundred
horse
power
Gnome
or
Green
was
considered
ample
for
every
need,
the
flights
were
very
restricted.
Now
that
three
hundred
horse
power
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception,
visits
to
the
upper
layers
have
become
easier
and
more
common.
Some
of
us
can
remember
how,
in
our
youth,
Garros
made
a
world
wide
reputation
by
attaining
nineteen
thousand
feet,
and
it
was
considered
a
remarkable
achievement
to
fly
over
the
Alps.
Our
standard
now
has
been
immeasurably
raised,
and
there
are
twenty
high
flights
for
one
in
former
years.
Many
of
them
have
been
undertaken
with
impunity.
The
thirty
thousand
foot
level
has
been
reached
time
after
time
with
no
discomfort
beyond
cold
and
asthma.
What
does
this
prove?
A
visitor
might
descend
upon
this
planet
a
thousand
times
and
never
see
a
tiger.
Yet
tigers
exist,
and
if
he
chanced
to
come
down
into
a
jungle
he
might
be
devoured.
There
are
jungles
of
the
upper
air,
and
there
are
worse
things
than
tigers
which
inhabit
them.
I
believe
in
time
they
will
map
these
jungles
accurately
out.
Even
at
the
present
moment
I
could
name
two
of
them.
One
of
them
lies
over
the
Pau
Biarritz
district
of
France.
Another
is
just
over
my
head
as
I
write
here
in
my
house
in
Wiltshire.
I
rather
think
there
is
a
third
in
the
Homburg
Wiesbaden
district.
"It
was
the
disappearance
of
the
airmen
that
first
set
me
thinking.
Of
course,
everyone
said
that
they
had
fallen
into
the
sea,
but
that
did
not
satisfy
me
at
all.
First,
there
was
Verrier
in
France;
his
machine
was
found
near
Bayonne,
but
they
never
got
his
body.
There
was
the
case
of
Baxter
also,
who
vanished,
though
his
engine
and
some
of
the
iron
fixings
were
found
in
a
wood
in
Leicestershire.
In
that
case,
Dr.
Middleton,
of
Amesbury,
who
was
watching
the
flight
with
a
telescope,
declares
that
just
before
the
clouds
obscured
the
view
he
saw
the
machine,
which
was
at
an
enormous
height,
suddenly
rise
perpendicularly
upwards
in
a
succession
of
jerks
in
a
manner
that
he
would
have
thought
to
be
impossible.
That
was
the
last
seen
of
Baxter.
There
was
a
correspondence
in
the
papers,
but
it
never
led
to
anything.
There
were
several
other
similar
cases,
and
then
there
was
the
death
of
Hay
Connor.
What
a
cackle
there
was
about
an
unsolved
mystery
of
the
air,
and
what
columns
in
the
halfpenny
papers,
and
yet
how
little
was
ever
done
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
business!
He
came
down
in
a
tremendous
vol
plane
from
an
unknown
height.
He
never
got
off
his
machine
and
died
in
his
pilot's
seat.
Died
of
what?
'Heart
disease,'
said
the
doctors.
Rubbish!
Hay
Connor's
heart
was
as
sound
as
mine
is.
What
did
Venables
say?
Venables
was
the
only
man
who
was
at
his
side
when
he
died.
He
said
that
he
was
shivering
and
looked
like
a
man
who
had
been
badly
scared.
'Died
of
fright,'
said
Venables,
but
could
not
imagine
what
he
was
frightened
about.
Only
said
one
word
to
Venables,
which
sounded
like
'Monstrous.'
They
could
make
nothing
of
that
at
the
inquest.
But
I
could
make
something
of
it.
Monsters!
That
was
the
last
word
of
poor
Harry
Hay
Connor.
And
he
DID
die
of
fright,
just
as
Venables
thought.
"And
then
there
was
Myrtle's
head.
Do
you
really
believe
does
anybody
really
believe
that
a
man's
head
could
be
driven
clean
into
his
body
by
the
force
of
a
fall?
Well,
perhaps
it
may
be
possible,
but
I,
for
one,
have
never
believed
that
it
was
so
with
Myrtle.
And
the
grease
upon
his
clothes
'all
slimy
with
grease,'
said
somebody
at
the
inquest.
Queer
that
nobody
got
thinking
after
that!
I
did
but,
then,
I
had
been
thinking
for
a
good
long
time.
I've
made
three
ascents
how
Dangerfield
used
to
chaff
me
about
my
shot
gun
but
I've
never
been
high
enough.
Now,
with
this
new,
light
Paul
Veroner
machine
and
its
one
hundred
and
seventy
five
Robur,
I
should
easily
touch
the
thirty
thousand
tomorrow.
I'll
have
a
shot
at
the
record.
Maybe
I
shall
have
a
shot
at
something
else
as
well.
Of
course,
it's
dangerous.
If
a
fellow
wants
to
avoid
danger
he
had
best
keep
out
of
flying
altogether
and
subside
finally
into
flannel
slippers
and
a
dressing
gown.
But
I'll
visit
the
air
jungle
tomorrow
and
if
there's
anything
there
I
shall
know
it.
If
I
return,
I'll
find
myself
a
bit
of
a
celebrity.
If
I
don't
this
note
book
may
explain
what
I
am
trying
to
do,
and
how
I
lost
my
life
in
doing
it.
But
no
drivel
about
accidents
or
mysteries,
if
YOU
please.
