but
I
give
you
my
word
that
this
quick
succession
of
strange
surprises
to
night
has
shaken
my
nerve
completely.
I
should
like,
however,
to
see
the
matter
through
with
you,
now
that
I
have
got
so
far."
"Your
presence
will
be
of
great
service
to
me,"
he
answered.
"We
shall
work
the
case
out
independently,
and
leave
this
fellow
Jones
to
exult
over
any
mare's
nest
which
he
may
choose
to
construct.
When
you
have
dropped
Miss
Morstan
I
wish
you
to
go
on
to
No.

Pinchin
Lane,
down
near
the
water's
edge
at
Lambeth.
The
third
house
on
the
right
hand
side
is
a
bird
stuffer's:
Sherman
is
the
name.
You
will
see
a
weasel
holding
a
young
rabbit
in
the
window.
Knock
old
Sherman
up,
and
tell
him,
with
my
compliments,
that
I
want
Toby
at
once.
You
will
bring
Toby
back
in
the
cab
with
you."
"A
dog,
I
suppose."
"Yes,
a
queer
mongrel,
with
a
most
amazing
power
of
scent.
I
would
rather
have
Toby's
help
than
that
of
the
whole
detective
force
of
London."
"I
shall
bring
him,
then,"
said
I.
"It
is
one
now.
I
ought
to
be
back
before
three,
if
I
can
get
a
fresh
horse."
"And
I,"
said
Holmes,
"shall
see
what
I
can
learn
from
Mrs.
Bernstone,
and
from
the
Indian
servant,
who,
Mr.
Thaddeus
tell
me,
sleeps
in
the
next
garret.
Then
I
shall
study
the
great
Jones's
methods
and
listen
to
his
not
too
delicate
sarcasms.

The
Episode
of
the
Barrel
The
police
had
brought
a
cab
with
them,
and
in
this
I
escorted
Miss
Morstan
back
to
her
home.
After
the
angelic
fashion
of
women,
she
had
borne
trouble
with
a
calm
face
as
long
as
there
was
some
one
weaker
than
herself
to
support,
and
I
had
found
her
bright
and
placid
by
the
side
of
the
frightened
housekeeper.
In
the
cab,
however,
she
first
turned
faint,
and
then
burst
into
a
passion
of
weeping,
so
sorely
had
she
been
tried
by
the
adventures
of
the
night.
She
has
told
me
since
that
she
thought
me
cold
and
distant
upon
that
journey.
She
little
guessed
the
struggle
within
my
breast,
or
the
effort
of
self
restraint
which
held
me
back.
My
sympathies
and
my
love
went
out
to
her,
even
as
my
hand
had
in
the
garden.
I
felt
that
years
of
the
conventionalities
of
life
could
not
teach
me
to
know
her
sweet,
brave
nature
as
had
this
one
day
of
strange
experiences.
Yet
there
were
two
thoughts
which
sealed
the
words
of
affection
upon
my
lips.
She
was
weak
and
helpless,
shaken
in
mind
and
nerve.
It
was
to
take
her
at
a
disadvantage
to
obtrude
love
upon
her
at
such
a
time.
Worse
still,
she
was
rich.
If
Holmes's
researches
were
successful,
she
would
be
an
heiress.
Was
it
fair,
was
it
honorable,
that
a
half
pay
surgeon
should
take
such
advantage
of
an
intimacy
which
chance
had
brought
about?
Might
she
not
look
upon
me
as
a
mere
vulgar
fortune
seeker?
I
could
not
bear
to
risk
that
such
a
thought
should
cross
her
mind.
This
Agra
treasure
intervened
like
an
impassable
barrier
between
us.
It
was
nearly
two
o'clock
when
we
reached
Mrs.
Cecil
Forrester's.
The
servants
had
retired
hours
ago,
but
Mrs.
Forrester
had
been
so
interested
by
the
strange
message
which
Miss
Morstan
had
received
that
she
had
sat
up
in
the
hope
of
her
return.
She
opened
the
door
herself,
a
middle
aged,
graceful
woman,
and
it
gave
me
joy
to
see
how
tenderly
her
arm
stole
round
the
other's
waist
and
how
motherly
was
the
voice
in
which
she
greeted
her.
She
was
clearly
no
mere
paid
dependant,
but
an
honored
friend.
I
was
introduced,
and
Mrs.
Forrester
earnestly
begged
me
to
step
in
and
tell
her
our
adventures.
I
explained,
however,
the
importance
of
my
errand,
and
promised
faithfully
to
call
and
report
any
progress
which
we
might
make
with
the
case.
As
we
drove
away
I
stole
a
glance
back,
and
I
still
seem
to
see
that
little
group
on
the
step,
the
two
graceful,
clinging
figures,
the
half
opened
door,
the
hall
light
shining
through
stained
glass,
the
barometer,
and
the
bright
stair
rods.
It
was
soothing
to
catch
even
that
passing
glimpse
of
a
tranquil
English
home
in
the
midst
of
the
wild,
dark
business
which
had
absorbed
us.
And
the
more
I
thought
of
what
had
happened,
the
wilder
and
darker
it
grew.
I
reviewed
the
whole
extraordinary
sequence
of
events
as
I
rattled
on
through
the
silent
gas
lit
streets.
There
was
the
original
problem:
that
at
least
was
pretty
clear
now.
The
death
of
Captain
Morstan,
the
sending
of
the
pearls,
the
advertisement,
the
letter,
we
had
had
light
upon
all
those
events.
They
had
only
led
us,
however,
to
a
deeper
and
far
more
tragic
mystery.
The
Indian
treasure,
the
curious
plan
found
among
Morstan's
baggage,
the
strange
scene
at
Major
Sholto's
death,
the
rediscovery
of
the
treasure
immediately
followed
by
the
murder
of
the
discoverer,
the
very
singular
accompaniments
to
the
crime,
the
footsteps,
the
remarkable
weapons,
the
words
upon
the
card,
corresponding
with
those
upon
Captain
Morstan's
chart,
here
was
indeed
a
labyrinth
in
which
a
man
less
singularly
endowed
than
my
fellow
lodger
might
well
despair
of
ever
finding
the
clue.
Pinchin
Lane
was
a
row
of
shabby
two
storied
brick
houses
in
the
lower
quarter
of
Lambeth.
I
had
to
knock
for
some
time
at
No.
3
before
I
could
make
my
impression.
At
last,
however,
there
was
the
glint
of
a
candle
behind
the
blind,
and
a
face
looked
out
at
the
upper
window.
"Go
on,
you
drunken
vagabone,"
said
the
face.
"If
you
kick
up
any
more
row
I'll
open
the
kennels
and
let
out
forty
three
dogs
upon
you."
"If
you'll
let
one
out
it's
