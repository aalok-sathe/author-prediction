rubbish
found
in
a
cupboard
in
an
ancient
house
at
the
back
of
the
Rue
Mathurin,
in
the
Quartier
Latin.
The
dining
room
of
this
old
house
is
decorated
with
a
coat
of
arms,
chevrons,
and
bars
rouge
upon
a
field
argent,
which
prove,
upon
inquiry,
to
be
the
shield
of
Nicholas
de
la
Reynie,
a
high
official
of
King
Louis
XIV.
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
other
articles
in
the
cupboard
date
back
to
the
early
days
of
that
king.
The
inference
is,
therefore,
that
they
were
all
the
property
of
this
Nicholas
de
la
Reynie,
who
was,
as
I
understand,
the
gentleman
specially
concerned
with
the
maintenance
and
execution
of
the
Draconic
laws
of
that
epoch."
"What
then?"
"I
would
ask
you
now
to
take
the
funnel
into
your
hands
once
more
and
to
examine
the
upper
brass
rim.
Can
you
make
out
any
lettering
upon
it?"
There
were
certainly
some
scratches
upon
it,
almost
obliterated
by
time.
The
general
effect
was
of
several
letters,
the
last
of
which
bore
some
resemblance
to
a
B.
"You
make
it
a
B?"
"Yes,
I
do."
"So
do
I.
In
fact,
I
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
it
is
a
B."
"But
the
nobleman
you
mentioned
would
have
had
R
for
his
initial."
"Exactly!
That's
the
beauty
of
it.
He
owned
this
curious
object,
and
yet
he
had
someone
else's
initials
upon
it.
Why
did
he
do
this?"
"I
can't
imagine;
can
you?"
"Well,
I
might,
perhaps,
guess.
Do
you
observe
something
drawn
a
little
farther
along
the
rim?"
"I
should
say
it
was
a
crown."
"It
is
undoubtedly
a
crown;
but
if
you
examine
it
in
a
good
light,
you
will
convince
yourself
that
it
is
not
an
ordinary
crown.
It
is
a
heraldic
crown
a
badge
of
rank,
and
it
consists
of
an
alternation
of
four
pearls
and
strawberry
leaves,
the
proper
badge
of
a
marquis.
We
may
infer,
therefore,
that
the
person
whose
initials
end
in
B
was
entitled
to
wear
that
coronet."
"Then
this
common
leather
filler
belonged
to
a
marquis?"
Dacre
gave
a
peculiar
smile.
"Or
to
some
member
of
the
family
of
a
marquis,"
said
he.
"So
much
we
have
clearly
gathered
from
this
engraved
rim."
"But
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
dreams?"
I
do
not
know
whether
it
was
from
a
look
upon
Dacre's
face,
or
from
some
subtle
suggestion
in
his
manner,
but
a
feeling
of
repulsion,
of
unreasoning
horror,
came
upon
me
as
I
looked
at
the
gnarled
old
lump
of
leather.
"I
have
more
than
once
received
important
information
through
my
dreams,"
said
my
companion
in
the
didactic
manner
which
he
loved
to
affect.
"I
make
it
a
rule
now
when
I
am
in
doubt
upon
any
material
point
to
place
the
article
in
question
beside
me
as
I
sleep,
and
to
hope
for
some
enlightenment.
The
process
does
not
appear
to
me
to
be
very
obscure,
though
it
has
not
yet
received
the
blessing
of
orthodox
science.
According
to
my
theory,
any
object
which
has
been
intimately
associated
with
any
supreme
paroxysm
of
human
emotion,
whether
it
be
joy
or
pain,
will
retain
a
certain
atmosphere
or
association
which
it
is
capable
of
communicating
to
a
sensitive
mind.
By
a
sensitive
mind
I
do
not
mean
an
abnormal
one,
but
such
a
trained
and
educated
mind
as
you
or
I
possess."
"You
mean,
for
example,
that
if
I
slept
beside
that
old
sword
upon
the
wall,
I
might
dream
of
some
bloody
incident
in
which
that
very
sword
took
part?"
"An
excellent
example,
for,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
sword
was
used
in
that
fashion
by
me,
and
I
saw
in
my
sleep
the
death
of
its
owner,
who
perished
in
a
brisk
skirmish,
which
I
have
been
unable
to
identify,
but
which
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
wars
of
the
Frondists.
If
you
think
of
it,
some
of
our
popular
observances
show
that
the
fact
has
already
been
recognized
by
our
ancestors,
although
we,
in
our
wisdom,
have
classed
it
among
superstitions."
"For
example?"
"Well,
the
placing
of
the
bride's
cake
beneath
the
pillow
in
order
that
the
sleeper
may
have
pleasant
dreams.
That
is
one
of
several
instances
which
you
will
find
set
forth
in
a
small
brochure
which
I
am
myself
writing
upon
the
subject.
But
to
come
back
to
the
point,
I
slept
one
night
with
this
funnel
beside
me,
and
I
had
a
dream
which
certainly
throws
a
curious
light
upon
its
use
and
origin."
"What
did
you
dream?"
"I
dreamed
"
He
paused,
and
an
intent
look
of
interest
came
over
his
massive
face.
"By
Jove,
that's
well
thought
of,"
said
he.
"This
really
will
be
an
exceedingly
interesting
experiment.
You
are
yourself
a
psychic
subject
with
nerves
which
respond
readily
to
any
impression."
"I
have
never
tested
myself
in
that
direction."
"Then
we
shall
test
you
tonight.
Might
I
ask
you
as
a
very
great
favour,
when
you
occupy
that
couch
tonight,
to
sleep
with
this
old
funnel
placed
by
the
side
of
your
pillow?"
The
request
seemed
to
me
a
grotesque
one;
but
I
have
myself,
in
my
complex
nature,
a
hunger
after
all
which
is
bizarre
and
fantastic.
I
had
not
the
faintest
belief
in
Dacre's
theory,
nor
any
hopes
for
success
in
such
an
experiment;
yet
it
amused
me
that
the
experiment
should
be
made.
Dacre,
with
great
gravity,
drew
a
small
stand
to
the
head
of
my
settee,
and
placed
the
funnel
upon
it.
Then,
after
a
short
conversation,
he
wished
me
good
night
and
left
me.
I
sat
for
some
little
time
smoking
by
the
smouldering
fire,
and
turning
over
in
my
mind
the
curious
incident
which
had
occurred,
and
the
strange
experience
which
might
lie
before
me.
Sceptical
as
I
was,
there
was
something
impressive
in
the
assurance
of
Dacre's
manner,
and
my
extraordinary
surroundings,
the
huge
room
with
the
strange
and
often
sinister
objects
which
were
hung
round
it,
struck
