the
facts
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain
them.
They
are
collated
from
the
Liverpool
papers
of
that
date,
from
the
proceedings
at
the
inquest
upon
John
Slater,
the
engine
driver,
and
from
the
records
of
the
London
and
West
Coast
Railway
Company,
which
have
been
courteously
put
at
my
disposal.
Briefly,
they
are
as
follows:
On
the
3rd
of
June,
1890,
a
gentleman,
who
gave
his
name
as
Monsieur
Louis
Caratal,
desired
an
interview
with
Mr.
James
Bland,
the
superintendent
of
the
London
and
West
Coast
Central
Station
in
Liverpool.
He
was
a
small
man,
middle
aged
and
dark,
with
a
stoop
which
was
so
marked
that
it
suggested
some
deformity
of
the
spine.
He
was
accompanied
by
a
friend,
a
man
of
imposing
physique,
whose
deferential
manner
and
constant
attention
showed
that
his
position
was
one
of
dependence.
This
friend
or
companion,
whose
name
did
not
transpire,
was
certainly
a
foreigner,
and
probably
from
his
swarthy
complexion,
either
a
Spaniard
or
a
South
American.
One
peculiarity
was
observed
in
him.
He
carried
in
his
left
hand
a
small
black,
leather
dispatch
box,
and
it
was
noticed
by
a
sharp
eyed
clerk
in
the
Central
office
that
this
box
was
fastened
to
his
wrist
by
a
strap.
No
importance
was
attached
to
the
fact
at
the
time,
but
subsequent
events
endowed
it
with
some
significance.
Monsieur
Caratal
was
shown
up
to
Mr.
Bland's
office,
while
his
companion
remained
outside.
Monsieur
Caratal's
business
was
quickly
dispatched.
He
had
arrived
that
afternoon
from
Central
America.
Affairs
of
the
utmost
importance
demanded
that
he
should
be
in
Paris
without
the
loss
of
an
unnecessary
hour.
He
had
missed
the
London
express.
A
special
must
be
provided.
Money
was
of
no
importance.
Time
was
everything.
If
the
company
would
speed
him
on
his
way,
they
might
make
their
own
terms.
Mr.
Bland
struck
the
electric
bell,
summoned
Mr.
Potter
Hood,
the
traffic
manager,
and
had
the
matter
arranged
in
five
minutes.
The
train
would
start
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour.
It
would
take
that
time
to
insure
that
the
line
should
be
clear.
The
powerful
engine
called
Rochdale
(No.
247
on
the
company's
register)
was
attached
to
two
carriages,
with
a
guard's
van
behind.
The
first
carriage
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
decreasing
the
inconvenience
arising
from
the
oscillation.
The
second
was
divided,
as
usual,
into
four
compartments,
a
first
class,
a
first
class
smoking,
a
second
class,
and
a
second
class
smoking.
The
first
compartment,
which
was
nearest
to
the
engine,
was
the
one
allotted
to
the
travellers.
The
other
three
were
empty.
The
guard
of
the
special
train
was
James
McPherson,
who
had
been
some
years
in
the
service
of
the
company.
The
stoker,
William
Smith,
was
a
new
hand.
Monsieur
Caratal,
upon
leaving
the
superintendent's
office,
rejoined
his
companion,
and
both
of
them
manifested
extreme
impatience
to
be
off.
Having
paid
the
money
asked,
which
amounted
to
fifty
pounds
five
shillings,
at
the
usual
special
rate
of
five
shillings
a
mile,
they
demanded
to
be
shown
the
carriage,
and
at
once
took
their
seats
in
it,
although
they
were
assured
that
the
better
part
of
an
hour
must
elapse
before
the
line
could
be
cleared.
In
the
meantime
a
singular
coincidence
had
occurred
in
the
office
which
Monsieur
Caratal
had
just
quitted.
A
request
for
a
special
is
not
a
very
uncommon
circumstance
in
a
rich
commercial
centre,
but
that
two
should
be
required
upon
the
same
afternoon
was
most
unusual.
It
so
happened,
however,
that
Mr.
Bland
had
hardly
dismissed
the
first
traveller
before
a
second
entered
with
a
similar
request.
This
was
a
Mr.
Horace
Moore,
a
gentlemanly
man
of
military
appearance,
who
alleged
that
the
sudden
serious
illness
of
his
wife
in
London
made
it
absolutely
imperative
that
he
should
not
lose
an
instant
in
starting
upon
the
journey.
His
distress
and
anxiety
were
so
evident
that
Mr.
Bland
did
all
that
was
possible
to
meet
his
wishes.
A
second
special
was
out
of
the
question,
as
the
ordinary
local
service
was
already
somewhat
deranged
by
the
first.
There
was
the
alternative,
however,
that
Mr.
Moore
should
share
the
expense
of
Monsieur
Caratal's
train,
and
should
travel
in
the
other
empty
first
class
compartment,
if
Monsieur
Caratal
objected
to
having
him
in
the
one
which
he
occupied.
It
was
difficult
to
see
any
objection
to
such
an
arrangement,
and
yet
Monsieur
Caratal,
upon
the
suggestion
being
made
to
him
by
Mr.
Potter
Hood,
absolutely
refused
to
consider
it
for
an
instant.
The
train
was
his,
he
said,
and
he
would
insist
upon
the
exclusive
use
of
it.
All
argument
failed
to
overcome
his
ungracious
objections,
and
finally
the
plan
had
to
be
abandoned.
Mr.
Horace
Moore
left
the
station
in
great
distress,
after
learning
that
his
only
course
was
to
take
the
ordinary
slow
train
which
leaves
Liverpool
at
six
o'clock.
At
four
thirty
one
exactly
by
the
station
clock
the
special
train,
containing
the
crippled
Monsieur
Caratal
and
his
gigantic
companion,
steamed
out
of
the
Liverpool
station.
The
line
was
at
that
time
clear,
and
there
should
have
been
no
stoppage
before
Manchester.
The
trains
of
the
London
and
West
Coast
Railway
run
over
the
lines
of
another
company
as
far
as
this
town,
which
should
have
been
reached
by
the
special
rather
before
six
o'clock.
At
a
quarter
after
six
considerable
surprise
and
some
consternation
were
caused
amongst
the
officials
at
Liverpool
by
the
receipt
of
a
telegram
from
Manchester
to
say
that
it
had
not
yet
arrived.
An
inquiry
directed
to
St.
Helens,
which
is
a
third
of
the
way
between
the
two
cities,
elicited
the
following
reply
"To
James
Bland,
Superintendent,
Central
L.
&
W.
C.,
Liverpool.
Special
passed
here
at
4:52,
well
up
to
time.
Dowster,
St.
Helens."
This
telegram
was
received
at
six
forty.
At
six
fifty
a
second
message
was
received
from
Manchester
"No
sign
of
special
as
advised
by
you."
And
then
ten
minutes
