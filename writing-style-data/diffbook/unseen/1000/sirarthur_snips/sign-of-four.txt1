The
Science
of
Deduction
Sherlock
Holmes
took
his
bottle
from
the
corner
of
the
mantel
piece
and
his
hypodermic
syringe
from
its
neat
morocco
case.
With
his
long,
white,
nervous
fingers
he
adjusted
the
delicate
needle,
and
rolled
back
his
left
shirt
cuff.
For
some
little
time
his
eyes
rested
thoughtfully
upon
the
sinewy
forearm
and
wrist
all
dotted
and
scarred
with
innumerable
puncture
marks.
Finally
he
thrust
the
sharp
point
home,
pressed
down
the
tiny
piston,
and
sank
back
into
the
velvet
lined
arm
chair
with
a
long
sigh
of
satisfaction.
Three
times
a
day
for
many
months
I
had
witnessed
this
performance,
but
custom
had
not
reconciled
my
mind
to
it.
On
the
contrary,
from
day
to
day
I
had
become
more
irritable
at
the
sight,
and
my
conscience
swelled
nightly
within
me
at
the
thought
that
I
had
lacked
the
courage
to
protest.
Again
and
again
I
had
registered
a
vow
that
I
should
deliver
my
soul
upon
the
subject,
but
there
was
that
in
the
cool,
nonchalant
air
of
my
companion
which
made
him
the
last
man
with
whom
one
would
care
to
take
anything
approaching
to
a
liberty.
His
great
powers,
his
masterly
manner,
and
the
experience
which
I
had
had
of
his
many
extraordinary
qualities,
all
made
me
diffident
and
backward
in
crossing
him.
Yet
upon
that
afternoon,
whether
it
was
the
Beaune
which
I
had
taken
with
my
lunch,
or
the
additional
exasperation
produced
by
the
extreme
deliberation
of
his
manner,
I
suddenly
felt
that
I
could
hold
out
no
longer.
"Which
is
it
to
day?"
I
asked,
"morphine
or
cocaine?"
He
raised
his
eyes
languidly
from
the
old
black
letter
volume
which
he
had
opened.
"It
is
cocaine,"
he
said,
"a
seven
per
cent.
solution.
Would
you
care
to
try
it?"
"No,
indeed,"
I
answered,
brusquely.
"My
constitution
has
not
got
over
the
Afghan
campaign
yet.
I
cannot
afford
to
throw
any
extra
strain
upon
it."
He
smiled
at
my
vehemence.
"Perhaps
you
are
right,
Watson,"
he
said.
"I
suppose
that
its
influence
is
physically
a
bad
one.
I
find
it,
however,
so
transcendently
stimulating
and
clarifying
to
the
mind
that
its
secondary
action
is
a
matter
of
small
moment."
"But
consider!"
I
said,
earnestly.
"Count
the
cost!
Your
brain
may,
as
you
say,
be
roused
and
excited,
but
it
is
a
pathological
and
morbid
process,
which
involves
increased
tissue
change
and
may
at
last
leave
a
permanent
weakness.
You
know,
too,
what
a
black
reaction
comes
upon
you.
Surely
the
game
is
hardly
worth
the
candle.
Why
should
you,
for
a
mere
passing
pleasure,
risk
the
loss
of
those
great
powers
with
which
you
have
been
endowed?
Remember
that
I
speak
not
only
as
one
comrade
to
another,
but
as
a
medical
man
to
one
for
whose
constitution
he
is
to
some
extent
answerable."
He
did
not
seem
offended.
On
the
contrary,
he
put
his
finger
tips
together
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
arms
of
his
chair,
like
one
who
has
a
relish
for
conversation.
"My
mind,"
he
said,
"rebels
at
stagnation.
Give
me
problems,
give
me
work,
give
me
the
most
abstruse
cryptogram
or
the
most
intricate
analysis,
and
I
am
in
my
own
proper
atmosphere.
I
can
dispense
then
with
artificial
stimulants.
But
I
abhor
the
dull
routine
of
existence.
I
crave
for
mental
exaltation.
That
is
why
I
have
chosen
my
own
particular
profession,
or
rather
created
it,
for
I
am
the
only
one
in
the
world."
"The
only
unofficial
detective?"
I
said,
raising
my
eyebrows.
"The
only
unofficial
consulting
detective,"
he
answered.
"I
am
the
last
and
highest
court
of
appeal
in
detection.
When
Gregson
or
Lestrade
or
Athelney
Jones
are
out
of
their
depths
which,
by
the
way,
is
their
normal
state
the
matter
is
laid
before
me.
I
examine
the
data,
as
an
expert,
and
pronounce
a
specialist's
opinion.
I
claim
no
credit
in
such
cases.
My
name
figures
in
no
newspaper.
The
work
itself,
the
pleasure
of
finding
a
field
for
my
peculiar
powers,
is
my
highest
reward.
But
you
have
yourself
had
some
experience
of
my
methods
of
work
in
the
Jefferson
Hope
case."
"Yes,
indeed,"
said
I,
cordially.
"I
was
never
so
struck
by
anything
in
my
life.
I
even
embodied
it
in
a
small
brochure
with
the
somewhat
fantastic
title
of
'A
Study
in
Scarlet.'"
He
shook
his
head
sadly.
"I
glanced
over
it,"
said
he.
"Honestly,
I
cannot
congratulate
you
upon
it.
Detection
is,
or
ought
to
be,
an
exact
science,
and
should
be
treated
in
the
same
cold
and
unemotional
manner.
You
have
attempted
to
tinge
it
with
romanticism,
which
produces
much
the
same
effect
as
if
you
worked
a
love
story
or
an
elopement
into
the
fifth
proposition
of
Euclid."
"But
the
romance
was
there,"
I
remonstrated.
"I
could
not
tamper
with
the
facts."
"Some
facts
should
be
suppressed,
or
at
least
a
just
sense
of
proportion
should
be
observed
in
treating
them.
The
only
point
in
the
case
which
deserved
mention
was
the
curious
analytical
reasoning
from
effects
to
causes
by
which
I
succeeded
in
unraveling
it."
I
was
annoyed
at
this
criticism
of
a
work
which
had
been
specially
designed
to
please
him.
I
confess,
too,
that
I
was
irritated
by
the
egotism
which
seemed
to
demand
that
every
line
of
my
pamphlet
should
be
devoted
to
his
own
special
doings.
More
than
once
during
the
years
that
I
had
lived
with
him
in
Baker
Street
I
had
observed
that
a
small
vanity
underlay
my
companion's
quiet
and
didactic
manner.
I
made
no
remark,
however,
but
sat
nursing
my
wounded
leg.
I
had
a
Jezail
bullet
through
it
some
time
before,
and,
though
it
did
not
prevent
me
from
walking,
it
ached
wearily
at
every
change
of
the
weather.
"My
practice
has
extended
recently
to
the
Continent,"
said
Holmes,
after
a
while,
filling
up
his
old
brier
root
pipe.
"I
was
consulted
last
week
by
Francois
Le
Villard,
who,
as
you
probably
know,
has
