bye,
and
never
hesitate
night
or
day
to
send
for
me
if
I
can
be
of
service."
The
wheels
died
away
down
the
drive
while
Sir
Henry
and
I
turned
into
the
hall,
and
the
door
clanged
heavily
behind
us.
It
was
a
fine
apartment
in
which
we
found
ourselves,
large,
lofty,
and
heavily
raftered
with
huge
baulks
of
age
blackened
oak.
In
the
great
old
fashioned
fireplace
behind
the
high
iron
dogs
a
log
fire
crackled
and
snapped.
Sir
Henry
and
I
held
out
our
hands
to
it,
for
we
were
numb
from
our
long
drive.
Then
we
gazed
round
us
at
the
high,
thin
window
of
old
stained
glass,
the
oak
panelling,
the
stags'
heads,
the
coats
of
arms
upon
the
walls,
all
dim
and
sombre
in
the
subdued
light
of
the
central
lamp.
"It's
just
as
I
imagined
it,"
said
Sir
Henry.
"Is
it
not
the
very
picture
of
an
old
family
home?
To
think
that
this
should
be
the
same
hall
in
which
for
five
hundred
years
my
people
have
lived.
It
strikes
me
solemn
to
think
of
it."
I
saw
his
dark
face
lit
up
with
a
boyish
enthusiasm
as
he
gazed
about
him.
The
light
beat
upon
him
where
he
stood,
but
long
shadows
trailed
down
the
walls
and
hung
like
a
black
canopy
above
him.
Barrymore
had
returned
from
taking
our
luggage
to
our
rooms.
He
stood
in
front
of
us
now
with
the
subdued
manner
of
a
well
trained
servant.
He
was
a
remarkable
looking
man,
tall,
handsome,
with
a
square
black
beard
and
pale,
distinguished
features.
"Would
you
wish
dinner
to
be
served
at
once,
sir?"
"Is
it
ready?"
"In
a
very
few
minutes,
sir.
You
will
find
hot
water
in
your
rooms.
My
wife
and
I
will
be
happy,
Sir
Henry,
to
stay
with
you
until
you
have
made
your
fresh
arrangements,
but
you
will
understand
that
under
the
new
conditions
this
house
will
require
a
considerable
staff."
"What
new
conditions?"
"I
only
meant,
sir,
that
Sir
Charles
led
a
very
retired
life,
and
we
were
able
to
look
after
his
wants.
You
would,
naturally,
wish
to
have
more
company,
and
so
you
will
need
changes
in
your
household."
"Do
you
mean
that
your
wife
and
you
wish
to
leave?"
"Only
when
it
is
quite
convenient
to
you,
sir."
"But
your
family
have
been
with
us
for
several
generations,
have
they
not?
I
should
be
sorry
to
begin
my
life
here
by
breaking
an
old
family
connection."
I
seemed
to
discern
some
signs
of
emotion
upon
the
butler's
white
face.
"I
feel
that
also,
sir,
and
so
does
my
wife.
But
to
tell
the
truth,
sir,
we
were
both
very
much
attached
to
Sir
Charles,
and
his
death
gave
us
a
shock
and
made
these
surroundings
very
painful
to
us.
I
fear
that
we
shall
never
again
be
easy
in
our
minds
at
Baskerville
Hall."
"But
what
do
you
intend
to
do?"
"I
have
no
doubt,
sir,
that
we
shall
succeed
in
establishing
ourselves
in
some
business.
Sir
Charles's
generosity
has
given
us
the
means
to
do
so.
And
now,
sir,
perhaps
I
had
best
show
you
to
your
rooms."
A
square
balustraded
gallery
ran
round
the
top
of
the
old
hall,
approached
by
a
double
stair.
From
this
central
point
two
long
corridors
extended
the
whole
length
of
the
building,
from
which
all
the
bedrooms
opened.
My
own
was
in
the
same
wing
as
Baskerville's
and
almost
next
door
to
it.
These
rooms
appeared
to
be
much
more
modern
than
the
central
part
of
the
house,
and
the
bright
paper
and
numerous
candles
did
something
to
remove
the
sombre
impression
which
our
arrival
had
left
upon
my
mind.
But
the
dining
room
which
opened
out
of
the
hall
was
a
place
of
shadow
and
gloom.
It
was
a
long
chamber
with
a
step
separating
the
dais
where
the
family
sat
from
the
lower
portion
reserved
for
their
dependents.
At
one
end
a
minstrel's
gallery
overlooked
it.
Black
beams
shot
across
above
our
heads,
with
a
smoke
darkened
ceiling
beyond
them.
With
rows
of
flaring
torches
to
light
it
up,
and
the
colour
and
rude
hilarity
of
an
old
time
banquet,
it
might
have
softened;
but
now,
when
two
black
clothed
gentlemen
sat
in
the
little
circle
of
light
thrown
by
a
shaded
lamp,
one's
voice
became
hushed
and
one's
spirit
subdued.
A
dim
line
of
ancestors,
in
every
variety
of
dress,
from
the
Elizabethan
knight
to
the
buck
of
the
Regency,
stared
down
upon
us
and
daunted
us
by
their
silent
company.
We
talked
little,
and
I
for
one
was
glad
when
the
meal
was
over
and
we
were
able
to
retire
into
the
modern
billiard
room
and
smoke
a
cigarette.
"My
word,
it
isn't
a
very
cheerful
place,"
said
Sir
Henry.
"I
suppose
one
can
tone
down
to
it,
but
I
feel
a
bit
out
of
the
picture
at
present.
I
don't
wonder
that
my
uncle
got
a
little
jumpy
if
he
lived
all
alone
in
such
a
house
as
this.
However,
if
it
suits
you,
we
will
retire
early
tonight,
and
perhaps
things
may
seem
more
cheerful
in
the
morning."
I
drew
aside
my
curtains
before
I
went
to
bed
and
looked
out
from
my
window.
It
opened
upon
the
grassy
space
which
lay
in
front
of
the
hall
door.
Beyond,
two
copses
of
trees
moaned
and
swung
in
a
rising
wind.
A
half
moon
broke
through
the
rifts
of
racing
clouds.
In
its
cold
light
I
saw
beyond
the
trees
a
broken
fringe
of
rocks,
and
the
long,
low
curve
of
the
melancholy
moor.
I
closed
the
curtain,
feeling
that
my
last
impression
was
in
keeping
with
the
rest.
And
yet
it
was
not
quite
the
last.
I
found
myself
weary
and
yet
wakeful,
tossing
restlessly
from
side
to
side,
seeking
for
the
sleep
which
would
not
come.
Far
away
a
chiming
clock
struck
out
the
quarters
of
the
hours,
but
otherwise
a
deathly
silence
lay
