from
some
foul
pot.
It
appeared,
however,
to
be
rather
curious
than
angry.
With
a
sleek
ripple
of
its
long,
black
back
it
rose,
stretched
itself,
and
then
rearing
itself
on
its
hind
legs,
with
one
forepaw
against
the
wall,
it
raised
the
other,
and
drew
its
claws
across
the
wire
meshes
beneath
me.
One
sharp,
white
hook
tore
through
my
trousers
for
I
may
mention
that
I
was
still
in
evening
dress
and
dug
a
furrow
in
my
knee.
It
was
not
meant
as
an
attack,
but
rather
as
an
experiment,
for
upon
my
giving
a
sharp
cry
of
pain
he
dropped
down
again,
and
springing
lightly
into
the
room,
he
began
walking
swiftly
round
it,
looking
up
every
now
and
again
in
my
direction.
For
my
part
I
shuffled
backwards
until
I
lay
with
my
back
against
the
wall,
screwing
myself
into
the
smallest
space
possible.
The
farther
I
got
the
more
difficult
it
was
for
him
to
attack
me.
He
seemed
more
excited
now
that
he
had
begun
to
move
about,
and
he
ran
swiftly
and
noiselessly
round
and
round
the
den,
passing
continually
underneath
the
iron
couch
upon
which
I
lay.
It
was
wonderful
to
see
so
great
a
bulk
passing
like
a
shadow,
with
hardly
the
softest
thudding
of
velvety
pads.
The
candle
was
burning
low
so
low
that
I
could
hardly
see
the
creature.
And
then,
with
a
last
flare
and
splutter
it
went
out
altogether.
I
was
alone
with
the
cat
in
the
dark!
It
helps
one
to
face
a
danger
when
one
knows
that
one
has
done
all
that
possibly
can
be
done.
There
is
nothing
for
it
then
but
to
quietly
await
the
result.
In
this
case,
there
was
no
chance
of
safety
anywhere
except
the
precise
spot
where
I
was.
I
stretched
myself
out,
therefore,
and
lay
silently,
almost
breathlessly,
hoping
that
the
beast
might
forget
my
presence
if
I
did
nothing
to
remind
him.
I
reckoned
that
it
must
already
be
two
o'clock.
At
four
it
would
be
full
dawn.
I
had
not
more
than
two
hours
to
wait
for
daylight.
Outside,
the
storm
was
still
raging,
and
the
rain
lashed
continually
against
the
little
windows.
Inside,
the
poisonous
and
fetid
air
was
overpowering.
I
could
neither
hear
nor
see
the
cat.
I
tried
to
think
about
other
things
but
only
one
had
power
enough
to
draw
my
mind
from
my
terrible
position.
That
was
the
contemplation
of
my
cousin's
villainy,
his
unparalleled
hypocrisy,
his
malignant
hatred
of
me.
Beneath
that
cheerful
face
there
lurked
the
spirit
of
a
mediaeval
assassin.
And
as
I
thought
of
it
I
saw
more
clearly
how
cunningly
the
thing
had
been
arranged.
He
had
apparently
gone
to
bed
with
the
others.
No
doubt
he
had
his
witness
to
prove
it.
Then,
unknown
to
them,
he
had
slipped
down,
had
lured
me
into
his
den
and
abandoned
me.
His
story
would
be
so
simple.
He
had
left
me
to
finish
my
cigar
in
the
billiard
room.
I
had
gone
down
on
my
own
account
to
have
a
last
look
at
the
cat.
I
had
entered
the
room
without
observing
that
the
cage
was
opened,
and
I
had
been
caught.
How
could
such
a
crime
be
brought
home
to
him?
Suspicion,
perhaps
but
proof,
never!
How
slowly
those
dreadful
two
hours
went
by!
Once
I
heard
a
low,
rasping
sound,
which
I
took
to
be
the
creature
licking
its
own
fur.
Several
times
those
greenish
eyes
gleamed
at
me
through
the
darkness,
but
never
in
a
fixed
stare,
and
my
hopes
grew
stronger
that
my
presence
had
been
forgotten
or
ignored.
At
last
the
least
faint
glimmer
of
light
came
through
the
windows
I
first
dimly
saw
them
as
two
grey
squares
upon
the
black
wall,
then
grey
turned
to
white,
and
I
could
see
my
terrible
companion
once
more.
And
he,
alas,
could
see
me!
It
was
evident
to
me
at
once
that
he
was
in
a
much
more
dangerous
and
aggressive
mood
than
when
I
had
seen
him
last.
The
cold
of
the
morning
had
irritated
him,
and
he
was
hungry
as
well.
With
a
continual
growl
he
paced
swiftly
up
and
down
the
side
of
the
room
which
was
farthest
from
my
refuge,
his
whiskers
bristling
angrily,
and
his
tail
switching
and
lashing.
As
he
turned
at
the
corners
his
savage
eyes
always
looked
upwards
at
me
with
a
dreadful
menace.
I
knew
then
that
he
meant
to
kill
me.
Yet
I
found
myself
even
at
that
moment
admiring
the
sinuous
grace
of
the
devilish
thing,
its
long,
undulating,
rippling
movements,
the
gloss
of
its
beautiful
flanks,
the
vivid,
palpitating
scarlet
of
the
glistening
tongue
which
hung
from
the
jet
black
muzzle.
And
all
the
time
that
deep,
threatening
growl
was
rising
and
rising
in
an
unbroken
crescendo.
I
knew
that
the
crisis
was
at
hand.
It
was
a
miserable
hour
to
meet
such
a
death
so
cold,
so
comfortless,
shivering
in
my
light
dress
clothes
upon
this
gridiron
of
torment
upon
which
I
was
stretched.
I
tried
to
brace
myself
to
it,
to
raise
my
soul
above
it,
and
at
the
same
time,
with
the
lucidity
which
comes
to
a
perfectly
desperate
man,
I
cast
round
for
some
possible
means
of
escape.
One
thing
was
clear
to
me.
If
that
front
of
the
cage
was
only
back
in
its
position
once
more,
I
could
find
a
sure
refuge
behind
it.
Could
I
possibly
pull
it
back?
I
hardly
dared
to
move
for
fear
of
bringing
the
creature
upon
me.
Slowly,
very
slowly,
I
put
my
hand
forward
until
it
grasped
the
edge
of
the
front,
the
final
bar
which
protruded
through
the
wall.
To
my
surprise
it
came
quite
easily
to
my
jerk.
Of
course
the
difficulty
of
drawing
it
out
arose
from
the
fact
that
I
was
clinging
to
it.
I
pulled
again,
and
three
inches
of
it
came
through.
It
ran
apparently
on
wheels.
I
pulled
again
...
and
