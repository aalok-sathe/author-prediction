and
forgiveness.
"It
was
only
last
night
that
I
returned
to
England,
and
during
all
this
time
I
have
heard
nothing
of
the
sensation
which
my
supposed
death
had
caused,
nor
of
the
accusation
that
Mr.
Arthur
Morton
had
been
concerned
in
it.
It
was
in
a
late
evening
paper
that
I
read
an
account
of
the
proceedings
of
yesterday,
and
I
have
come
this
morning
as
fast
as
an
express
train
could
bring
me
to
testify
to
the
truth."
Such
was
the
remarkable
statement
of
Dr.
Aloysius
Lana
which
brought
the
trial
to
a
sudden
termination.
A
subsequent
investigation
corroborated
it
to
the
extent
of
finding
out
the
vessel
in
which
his
brother
Ernest
Lana
had
come
over
from
South
America.
The
ship's
doctor
was
able
to
testify
that
he
had
complained
of
a
weak
heart
during
the
voyage,
and
that
his
symptoms
were
consistent
with
such
a
death
as
was
described.
As
to
Dr.
Aloysius
Lana,
he
returned
to
the
village
from
which
he
had
made
so
dramatic
a
disappearance,
and
a
complete
reconciliation
was
effected
between
him
and
the
young
squire,
the
latter
having
acknowledged
that
he
had
entirely
misunderstood
the
other's
motives
in
withdrawing
from
his
engagement.
That
another
reconciliation
followed
may
be
judged
from
a
notice
extracted
from
a
prominent
column
in
the
Morning
Post:
"A
marriage
was
solemnized
upon
September
19th,
by
the
Rev.
Stephen
Johnson,
at
the
parish
church
of
Bishop's
Crossing,
between
Aloysius
Xavier
Lana,
son
of
Don
Alfredo
Lana,
formerly
Foreign
Minister
of
the
Argentine
Republic,
and
Frances
Morton,
only
daughter
of
the
late
James
Morton,
J.P.,
of
Leigh
Hall,
Bishop's
Crossing,
Lancashire."
The
Jew's
Breastplate
My
particular
friend,
Ward
Mortimer,
was
one
of
the
best
men
of
his
day
at
everything
connected
with
Oriental
archaeology.
He
had
written
largely
upon
the
subject,
he
had
lived
two
years
in
a
tomb
at
Thebes,
while
he
excavated
in
the
Valley
of
the
Kings,
and
finally
he
had
created
a
considerable
sensation
by
his
exhumation
of
the
alleged
mummy
of
Cleopatra
in
the
inner
room
of
the
Temple
of
Horus,
at
Philae.
With
such
a
record
at
the
age
of
thirty
one,
it
was
felt
that
a
considerable
career
lay
before
him,
and
no
one
was
surprised
when
he
was
elected
to
the
curatorship
of
the
Belmore
Street
Museum,
which
carries
with
it
the
lectureship
at
the
Oriental
College,
and
an
income
which
has
sunk
with
the
fall
in
land,
but
which
still
remains
at
that
ideal
sum
which
is
large
enough
to
encourage
an
investigator,
but
not
so
large
as
to
enervate
him.
There
was
only
one
reason
which
made
Ward
Mortimer's
position
a
little
difficult
at
the
Belmore
Street
Museum,
and
that
was
the
extreme
eminence
of
the
man
whom
he
had
to
succeed.
Professor
Andreas
was
a
profound
scholar
and
a
man
of
European
reputation.
His
lectures
were
frequented
by
students
from
every
part
of
the
world,
and
his
admirable
management
of
the
collection
intrusted
to
his
care
was
a
commonplace
in
all
learned
societies.
There
was,
therefore,
considerable
surprise
when,
at
the
age
of
fifty
five,
he
suddenly
resigned
his
position
and
retired
from
those
duties
which
had
been
both
his
livelihood
and
his
pleasure.
He
and
his
daughter
left
the
comfortable
suite
of
rooms
which
had
formed
his
official
residence
in
connection
with
the
museum,
and
my
friend,
Mortimer,
who
was
a
bachelor,
took
up
his
quarters
there.
On
hearing
of
Mortimer's
appointment
Professor
Andreas
had
written
him
a
very
kindly
and
flattering
congratulatory
letter.
I
was
actually
present
at
their
first
meeting,
and
I
went
with
Mortimer
round
the
museum
when
the
Professor
showed
us
the
admirable
collection
which
he
had
cherished
so
long.
The
Professor's
beautiful
daughter
and
a
young
man,
Captain
Wilson,
who
was,
as
I
understood,
soon
to
be
her
husband,
accompanied
us
in
our
inspection.
There
were
fifteen
rooms,
but
the
Babylonian,
the
Syrian,
and
the
central
hall,
which
contained
the
Jewish
and
Egyptian
collection,
were
the
finest
of
all.
Professor
Andreas
was
a
quiet,
dry,
elderly
man,
with
a
clean
shaven
face
and
an
impassive
manner,
but
his
dark
eyes
sparkled
and
his
features
quickened
into
enthusiastic
life
as
he
pointed
out
to
us
the
rarity
and
the
beauty
of
some
of
his
specimens.
His
hand
lingered
so
fondly
over
them,
that
one
could
read
his
pride
in
them
and
the
grief
in
his
heart
now
that
they
were
passing
from
his
care
into
that
of
another.
He
had
shown
us
in
turn
his
mummies,
his
papyri,
his
rare
scarabs,
his
inscriptions,
his
Jewish
relics,
and
his
duplication
of
the
famous
seven
branched
candlestick
of
the
Temple,
which
was
brought
to
Rome
by
Titus,
and
which
is
supposed
by
some
to
be
lying
at
this
instant
in
the
bed
of
the
Tiber.
Then
he
approached
a
case
which
stood
in
the
very
centre
of
the
hall,
and
he
looked
down
through
the
glass
with
reverence
in
his
attitude
and
manner.
"This
is
no
novelty
to
an
expert
like
yourself,
Mr.
Mortimer,"
said
he;
"but
I
daresay
that
your
friend,
Mr.
Jackson,
will
be
interested
to
see
it."
Leaning
over
the
case
I
saw
an
object,
some
five
inches
square,
which
consisted
of
twelve
precious
stones
in
a
framework
of
gold,
with
golden
hooks
at
two
of
the
corners.
The
stones
were
all
varying
in
sort
and
colour,
but
they
were
of
the
same
size.
Their
shapes,
arrangement,
and
gradation
of
tint
made
me
think
of
a
box
of
water
colour
paints.
Each
stone
had
some
hieroglyphic
scratched
upon
its
surface.
"You
have
heard,
Mr.
Jackson,
of
the
urim
and
thummim?"
I
had
heard
the
term,
but
my
idea
of
its
meaning
was
exceedingly
vague.
"The
urim
and
thummim
was
a
name
given
to
the
jewelled
plate
which
lay
upon
the
breast
of
the
high
priest
of
the
Jews.
They
had
a
very
special
feeling
of
reverence
for
it
something
of
the
feeling
which
an
ancient
Roman
might
have
for
the
Sibylline
books
