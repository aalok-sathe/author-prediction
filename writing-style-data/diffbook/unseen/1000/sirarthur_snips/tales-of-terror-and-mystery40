by
the
published
depth
of
the
canal,
which
was
entirely
insufficient
to
conceal
so
large
an
object.
The
second
correspondent
wrote
calling
attention
to
the
bag
which
appeared
to
be
the
sole
luggage
which
the
travellers
had
brought
with
them,
and
suggesting
that
some
novel
explosive
of
immense
and
pulverizing
power
might
have
been
concealed
in
it.
The
obvious
absurdity,
however,
of
supposing
that
the
whole
train
might
be
blown
to
dust
while
the
metals
remained
uninjured
reduced
any
such
explanation
to
a
farce.
The
investigation
had
drifted
into
this
hopeless
position
when
a
new
and
most
unexpected
incident
occurred.
This
was
nothing
less
than
the
receipt
by
Mrs.
McPherson
of
a
letter
from
her
husband,
James
McPherson,
who
had
been
the
guard
on
the
missing
train.
The
letter,
which
was
dated
July
5th,
1890,
was
posted
from
New
York
and
came
to
hand
upon
July
14th.
Some
doubts
were
expressed
as
to
its
genuine
character
but
Mrs.
McPherson
was
positive
as
to
the
writing,
and
the
fact
that
it
contained
a
remittance
of
a
hundred
dollars
in
five
dollar
notes
was
enough
in
itself
to
discount
the
idea
of
a
hoax.
No
address
was
given
in
the
letter,
which
ran
in
this
way:
MY
DEAR
WIFE,
"I
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal,
and
I
find
it
very
hard
to
give
you
up.
The
same
with
Lizzie.
I
try
to
fight
against
it,
but
it
will
always
come
back
to
me.
I
send
you
some
money
which
will
change
into
twenty
English
pounds.
This
should
be
enough
to
bring
both
Lizzie
and
you
across
the
Atlantic,
and
you
will
find
the
Hamburg
boats
which
stop
at
Southampton
very
good
boats,
and
cheaper
than
Liverpool.
If
you
could
come
here
and
stop
at
the
Johnston
House
I
would
try
and
send
you
word
how
to
meet,
but
things
are
very
difficult
with
me
at
present,
and
I
am
not
very
happy,
finding
it
hard
to
give
you
both
up.
So
no
more
at
present,
from
your
loving
husband,
"James
McPherson."
For
a
time
it
was
confidently
anticipated
that
this
letter
would
lead
to
the
clearing
up
of
the
whole
matter,
the
more
so
as
it
was
ascertained
that
a
passenger
who
bore
a
close
resemblance
to
the
missing
guard
had
travelled
from
Southampton
under
the
name
of
Summers
in
the
Hamburg
and
New
York
liner
Vistula,
which
started
upon
the
7th
of
June.
Mrs.
McPherson
and
her
sister
Lizzie
Dolton
went
across
to
New
York
as
directed
and
stayed
for
three
weeks
at
the
Johnston
House,
without
hearing
anything
from
the
missing
man.
It
is
probable
that
some
injudicious
comments
in
the
Press
may
have
warned
him
that
the
police
were
using
them
as
a
bait.
However,
this
may
be,
it
is
certain
that
he
neither
wrote
nor
came,
and
the
women
were
eventually
compelled
to
return
to
Liverpool.
And
so
the
matter
stood,
and
has
continued
to
stand
up
to
the
present
year
of
1898.
Incredible
as
it
may
seem,
nothing
has
transpired
during
these
eight
years
which
has
shed
the
least
light
upon
the
extraordinary
disappearance
of
the
special
train
which
contained
Monsieur
Caratal
and
his
companion.
Careful
inquiries
into
the
antecedents
of
the
two
travellers
have
only
established
the
fact
that
Monsieur
Caratal
was
well
known
as
a
financier
and
political
agent
in
Central
America,
and
that
during
his
voyage
to
Europe
he
had
betrayed
extraordinary
anxiety
to
reach
Paris.
His
companion,
whose
name
was
entered
upon
the
passenger
lists
as
Eduardo
Gomez,
was
a
man
whose
record
was
a
violent
one,
and
whose
reputation
was
that
of
a
bravo
and
a
bully.
There
was
evidence
to
show,
however,
that
he
was
honestly
devoted
to
the
interests
of
Monsieur
Caratal,
and
that
the
latter,
being
a
man
of
puny
physique,
employed
the
other
as
a
guard
and
protector.
It
may
be
added
that
no
information
came
from
Paris
as
to
what
the
objects
of
Monsieur
Caratal's
hurried
journey
may
have
been.
This
comprises
all
the
facts
of
the
case
up
to
the
publication
in
the
Marseilles
papers
of
the
recent
confession
of
Herbert
de
Lernac,
now
under
sentence
of
death
for
the
murder
of
a
merchant
named
Bonvalot.
This
statement
may
be
literally
translated
as
follows:
"It
is
not
out
of
mere
pride
or
boasting
that
I
give
this
information,
for,
if
that
were
my
object,
I
could
tell
a
dozen
actions
of
mine
which
are
quite
as
splendid;
but
I
do
it
in
order
that
certain
gentlemen
in
Paris
may
understand
that
I,
who
am
able
here
to
tell
about
the
fate
of
Monsieur
Caratal,
can
also
tell
in
whose
interest
and
at
whose
request
the
deed
was
done,
unless
the
reprieve
which
I
am
awaiting
comes
to
me
very
quickly.
Take
warning,
messieurs,
before
it
is
too
late!
You
know
Herbert
de
Lernac,
and
you
are
aware
that
his
deeds
are
as
ready
as
his
words.
Hasten
then,
or
you
are
lost!
"At
present
I
shall
mention
no
names
if
you
only
heard
the
names,
what
would
you
not
think!
but
I
shall
merely
tell
you
how
cleverly
I
did
it.
I
was
true
to
my
employers
then,
and
no
doubt
they
will
be
true
to
me
now.
I
hope
so,
and
until
I
am
convinced
that
they
have
betrayed
me,
these
names,
which
would
convulse
Europe,
shall
not
be
divulged.
But
on
that
day
...
well,
I
say
no
more!
"In
a
word,
then,
there
was
a
famous
trial
in
Paris,
in
the
year
1890,
in
connection
with
a
monstrous
scandal
in
politics
and
finance.
How
monstrous
that
scandal
was
can
never
be
known
save
by
such
confidential
agents
as
myself.
The
honour
and
careers
of
many
of
the
chief
men
in
France
were
at
stake.
You
have
seen
a
group
of
ninepins
standing,
all
so
rigid,
and
prim,
and
unbending.
Then
there
comes
the
ball
from
far
away
and
pop,
pop,
pop
there
are
your
ninepins
on
the
floor.
Well,
imagine
some
of
