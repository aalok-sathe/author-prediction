and
made
himself
such
a
valuable
decoy,
that
it
was
their
favourite
game
afterwards.
They
had
made
it
right
with
Tammany
and
with
the
police,
so
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
could
ever
stop
them,
for
those
were
in
the
days
before
the
Lexow
Commission,
and
if
you
only
had
a
pull,
you
could
do
pretty
nearly
everything
you
wanted.
"And
nothing
would
have
stopped
them
if
they
had
only
stuck
to
cards
and
New
York,
but
they
must
needs
come
up
Rochester
way,
and
forge
a
name
upon
a
cheque.
It
was
my
brother
that
did
it,
though
everyone
knew
that
it
was
under
the
influence
of
Sparrow
MacCoy.
I
bought
up
that
cheque,
and
a
pretty
sum
it
cost
me.
Then
I
went
to
my
brother,
laid
it
before
him
on
the
table,
and
swore
to
him
that
I
would
prosecute
if
he
did
not
clear
out
of
the
country.
At
first
he
simply
laughed.
I
could
not
prosecute,
he
said,
without
breaking
our
mother's
heart,
and
he
knew
that
I
would
not
do
that.
I
made
him
understand,
however,
that
our
mother's
heart
was
being
broken
in
any
case,
and
that
I
had
set
firm
on
the
point
that
I
would
rather
see
him
in
Rochester
gaol
than
in
a
New
York
hotel.
So
at
last
he
gave
in,
and
he
made
me
a
solemn
promise
that
he
would
see
Sparrow
MacCoy
no
more,
that
he
would
go
to
Europe,
and
that
he
would
turn
his
hand
to
any
honest
trade
that
I
helped
him
to
get.
I
took
him
down
right
away
to
an
old
family
friend,
Joe
Willson,
who
is
an
exporter
of
American
watches
and
clocks,
and
I
got
him
to
give
Edward
an
agency
in
London,
with
a
small
salary
and
a
15
per
cent
commission
on
all
business.
His
manner
and
appearance
were
so
good
that
he
won
the
old
man
over
at
once,
and
within
a
week
he
was
sent
off
to
London
with
a
case
full
of
samples.
"It
seemed
to
me
that
this
business
of
the
cheque
had
really
given
my
brother
a
fright,
and
that
there
was
some
chance
of
his
settling
down
into
an
honest
line
of
life.
My
mother
had
spoken
with
him,
and
what
she
said
had
touched
him,
for
she
had
always
been
the
best
of
mothers
to
him
and
he
had
been
the
great
sorrow
of
her
life.
But
I
knew
that
this
man
Sparrow
MacCoy
had
a
great
influence
over
Edward
and
my
chance
of
keeping
the
lad
straight
lay
in
breaking
the
connection
between
them.
I
had
a
friend
in
the
New
York
detective
force,
and
through
him
I
kept
a
watch
upon
MacCoy.
When,
within
a
fortnight
of
my
brother's
sailing,
I
heard
that
MacCoy
had
taken
a
berth
in
the
Etruria,
I
was
as
certain
as
if
he
had
told
me
that
he
was
going
over
to
England
for
the
purpose
of
coaxing
Edward
back
again
into
the
ways
that
he
had
left.
In
an
instant
I
had
resolved
to
go
also,
and
to
pit
my
influence
against
MacCoy's.
I
knew
it
was
a
losing
fight,
but
I
thought,
and
my
mother
thought,
that
it
was
my
duty.
We
passed
the
last
night
together
in
prayer
for
my
success,
and
she
gave
me
her
own
Testament
that
my
father
had
given
her
on
the
day
of
their
marriage
in
the
Old
Country,
so
that
I
might
always
wear
it
next
my
heart.
"I
was
a
fellow
traveller,
on
the
steamship,
with
Sparrow
MacCoy,
and
at
least
I
had
the
satisfaction
of
spoiling
his
little
game
for
the
voyage.
The
very
first
night
I
went
into
the
smoking
room,
and
found
him
at
the
head
of
a
card
table,
with
a
half
a
dozen
young
fellows
who
were
carrying
their
full
purses
and
their
empty
skulls
over
to
Europe.
He
was
settling
down
for
his
harvest,
and
a
rich
one
it
would
have
been.
But
I
soon
changed
all
that.
"'Gentlemen,'
said
I,
'are
you
aware
whom
you
are
playing
with?'
"'What's
that
to
you?
You
mind
your
own
business!'
said
he,
with
an
oath.
"'Who
is
it,
anyway?'
asked
one
of
the
dudes.
"'He's
Sparrow
MacCoy,
the
most
notorious
card
sharper
in
the
States.'
"Up
he
jumped
with
a
bottle
in
his
hand,
but
he
remembered
that
he
was
under
the
flag
of
the
effete
Old
Country,
where
law
and
order
run,
and
Tammany
has
no
pull.
Gaol
and
the
gallows
wait
for
violence
and
murder,
and
there's
no
slipping
out
by
the
back
door
on
board
an
ocean
liner.
"'Prove
your
words,
you
!'
said
he.
"'I
will!'
said
I.
'If
you
will
turn
up
your
right
shirt
sleeve
to
the
shoulder,
I
will
either
prove
my
words
or
I
will
eat
them.'
"He
turned
white
and
said
not
a
word.
You
see,
I
knew
something
of
his
ways,
and
I
was
aware
of
that
part
of
the
mechanism
which
he
and
all
such
sharpers
use
consists
of
an
elastic
down
the
arm
with
a
clip
just
above
the
wrist.
It
is
by
means
of
this
clip
that
they
withdraw
from
their
hands
the
cards
which
they
do
not
want,
while
they
substitute
other
cards
from
another
hiding
place.
I
reckoned
on
it
being
there,
and
it
was.
He
cursed
me,
slunk
out
of
the
saloon,
and
was
hardly
seen
again
during
the
voyage.
For
once,
at
any
rate,
I
got
level
with
Mister
Sparrow
MacCoy.
"But
he
soon
had
his
revenge
upon
me,
for
when
it
came
to
influencing
my
brother
he
outweighed
me
every
time.
Edward
had
kept
himself
straight
in
London
for
the
first
few
weeks,
and
had
done
some
business
with
his
American
watches,
until
this
villain
came
across
his
path
once
more.
I
did
my
best,
but
the
best
was
little
enough.
The
next
thing
I
heard
there
had
been
a
scandal
at
one
of
the
Northumberland
Avenue
hotels:
a
traveller
had
been
