reason
to
think
that
he
will
return
tonight
and
complete
the
job."
"Excellent!"
I
cried.
"We
will
keep
our
own
secret,
and
say
nothing
either
to
the
police
or
to
Simpson.
Will
you
join
me?"
"With
the
utmost
pleasure,"
said
I;
and
so
it
was
agreed.
It
was
ten
o'clock
that
night
when
I
returned
to
the
Belmore
Street
Museum.
Mortimer
was,
as
I
could
see,
in
a
state
of
suppressed
nervous
excitement,
but
it
was
still
too
early
to
begin
our
vigil,
so
we
remained
for
an
hour
or
so
in
his
chambers,
discussing
all
the
possibilities
of
the
singular
business
which
we
had
met
to
solve.
At
last
the
roaring
stream
of
hansom
cabs
and
the
rush
of
hurrying
feet
became
lower
and
more
intermittent
as
the
pleasure
seekers
passed
on
their
way
to
their
stations
or
their
homes.
It
was
nearly
twelve
when
Mortimer
led
the
way
to
the
lumber
room
which
overlooked
the
central
hall
of
the
museum.
He
had
visited
it
during
the
day,
and
had
spread
some
sacking
so
that
we
could
lie
at
our
ease,
and
look
straight
down
into
the
museum.
The
skylight
was
of
unfrosted
glass,
but
was
so
covered
with
dust
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
anyone
looking
up
from
below
to
detect
that
he
was
overlooked.
We
cleared
a
small
piece
at
each
corner,
which
gave
us
a
complete
view
of
the
room
beneath
us.
In
the
cold
white
light
of
the
electric
lamps
everything
stood
out
hard
and
clear,
and
I
could
see
the
smallest
detail
of
the
contents
of
the
various
cases.
Such
a
vigil
is
an
excellent
lesson,
since
one
has
no
choice
but
to
look
hard
at
those
objects
which
we
usually
pass
with
such
half
hearted
interest.
Through
my
little
peep
hole
I
employed
the
hours
in
studying
every
specimen,
from
the
huge
mummy
case
which
leaned
against
the
wall
to
those
very
jewels
which
had
brought
us
there,
gleaming
and
sparkling
in
their
glass
case
immediately
beneath
us.
There
was
much
precious
gold
work
and
many
valuable
stones
scattered
through
the
numerous
cases,
but
those
wonderful
twelve
which
made
up
the
urim
and
thummim
glowed
and
burned
with
a
radiance
which
far
eclipsed
the
others.
I
studied
in
turn
the
tomb
pictures
of
Sicara,
the
friezes
from
Karnak,
the
statues
of
Memphis,
and
the
inscriptions
of
Thebes,
but
my
eyes
would
always
come
back
to
that
wonderful
Jewish
relic,
and
my
mind
to
the
singular
mystery
which
surrounded
it.
I
was
lost
in
the
thought
of
it
when
my
companion
suddenly
drew
his
breath
sharply
in,
and
seized
my
arm
in
a
convulsive
grip.
At
the
same
instant
I
saw
what
it
was
which
had
excited
him.
I
have
said
that
against
the
wall
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
doorway
(the
right
hand
side
as
we
looked
at
it,
but
the
left
as
one
entered)
there
stood
a
large
mummy
case.
To
our
unutterable
amazement
it
was
slowly
opening.
Gradually,
gradually
the
lid
was
swinging
back,
and
the
black
slit
which
marked
the
opening
was
becoming
wider
and
wider.
So
gently
and
carefully
was
it
done
that
the
movement
was
almost
imperceptible.
Then,
as
we
breathlessly
watched
it,
a
white
thin
hand
appeared
at
the
opening,
pushing
back
the
painted
lid,
then
another
hand,
and
finally
a
face
a
face
which
was
familiar
to
us
both,
that
of
Professor
Andreas.
Stealthily
he
slunk
out
of
the
mummy
case,
like
a
fox
stealing
from
its
burrow,
his
head
turning
incessantly
to
left
and
to
right,
stepping,
then
pausing,
then
stepping
again,
the
very
image
of
craft
and
of
caution.
Once
some
sound
in
the
street
struck
him
motionless,
and
he
stood
listening,
with
his
ear
turned,
ready
to
dart
back
to
the
shelter
behind
him.
Then
he
crept
onwards
again
upon
tiptoe,
very,
very
softly
and
slowly,
until
he
had
reached
the
case
in
the
centre
of
the
room.
There
he
took
a
bunch
of
keys
from
his
pocket,
unlocked
the
case,
took
out
the
Jewish
breastplate,
and,
laying
it
upon
the
glass
in
front
of
him,
began
to
work
upon
it
with
some
sort
of
small,
glistening
tool.
He
was
so
directly
underneath
us
that
his
bent
head
covered
his
work,
but
we
could
guess
from
the
movement
of
his
hand
that
he
was
engaged
in
finishing
the
strange
disfigurement
which
he
had
begun.
I
could
realize
from
the
heavy
breathing
of
my
companion,
and
the
twitchings
of
the
hand
which
still
clutched
my
wrist,
the
furious
indignation
which
filled
his
heart
as
he
saw
this
vandalism
in
the
quarter
of
all
others
where
he
could
least
have
expected
it.
He,
the
very
man
who
a
fortnight
before
had
reverently
bent
over
this
unique
relic,
and
who
had
impressed
its
antiquity
and
its
sanctity
upon
us,
was
now
engaged
in
this
outrageous
profanation.
It
was
impossible,
unthinkable
and
yet
there,
in
the
white
glare
of
the
electric
light
beneath
us,
was
that
dark
figure
with
the
bent
grey
head,
and
the
twitching
elbow.
What
inhuman
hypocrisy,
what
hateful
depth
of
malice
against
his
successor
must
underlie
these
sinister
nocturnal
labours.
It
was
painful
to
think
of
and
dreadful
to
watch.
Even
I,
who
had
none
of
the
acute
feelings
of
a
virtuoso,
could
not
bear
to
look
on
and
see
this
deliberate
mutilation
of
so
ancient
a
relic.
It
was
a
relief
to
me
when
my
companion
tugged
at
my
sleeve
as
a
signal
that
I
was
to
follow
him
as
he
softly
crept
out
of
the
room.
It
was
not
until
we
were
within
his
own
quarters
that
he
opened
his
lips,
and
then
I
saw
by
his
agitated
face
how
deep
was
his
consternation.
"The
abominable
Goth!"
he
cried.
"Could
you
have
believed
it?"
"It
is
amazing."
"He
is
a
villain
or
a
lunatic
one
or
the
other.
We
shall
very
soon
see
which.
Come
with
me,
Jackson,
and
we
shall
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
black
