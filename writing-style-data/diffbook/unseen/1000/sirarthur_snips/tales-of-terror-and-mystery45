leaning
eagerly
forward
across
his
desk,
and
there
was
an
expression
of
something
like
anxiety
in
his
eyes.
"I
am
afraid
that
you
do
not
know
about
beetles,"
he
cried.
"On
the
contrary,
sir,
it
is
the
one
scientific
subject
about
which
I
feel
that
I
really
do
know
something."
"I
am
overjoyed
to
hear
it.
Please
talk
to
me
about
beetles."
I
talked.
I
do
not
profess
to
have
said
anything
original
upon
the
subject,
but
I
gave
a
short
sketch
of
the
characteristics
of
the
beetle,
and
ran
over
the
more
common
species,
with
some
allusions
to
the
specimens
in
my
own
little
collection
and
to
the
article
upon
"Burying
Beetles"
which
I
had
contributed
to
the
Journal
of
Entomological
Science.
"What!
not
a
collector?"
cried
Lord
Linchmere.
"You
don't
mean
that
you
are
yourself
a
collector?"
His
eyes
danced
with
pleasure
at
the
thought.
"You
are
certainly
the
very
man
in
London
for
my
purpose.
I
thought
that
among
five
millions
of
people
there
must
be
such
a
man,
but
the
difficulty
is
to
lay
one's
hands
upon
him.
I
have
been
extraordinarily
fortunate
in
finding
you."
He
rang
a
gong
upon
the
table,
and
the
footman
entered.
"Ask
Lady
Rossiter
to
have
the
goodness
to
step
this
way,"
said
his
lordship,
and
a
few
moments
later
the
lady
was
ushered
into
the
room.
She
was
a
small,
middle
aged
woman,
very
like
Lord
Linchmere
in
appearance,
with
the
same
quick,
alert
features
and
grey
black
hair.
The
expression
of
anxiety,
however,
which
I
had
observed
upon
his
face
was
very
much
more
marked
upon
hers.
Some
great
grief
seemed
to
have
cast
its
shadow
over
her
features.
As
Lord
Linchmere
presented
me
she
turned
her
face
full
upon
me,
and
I
was
shocked
to
observe
a
half
healed
scar
extending
for
two
inches
over
her
right
eyebrow.
It
was
partly
concealed
by
plaster,
but
none
the
less
I
could
see
that
it
had
been
a
serious
wound
and
not
long
inflicted.
"Dr.
Hamilton
is
the
very
man
for
our
purpose,
Evelyn,"
said
Lord
Linchmere.
"He
is
actually
a
collector
of
beetles,
and
he
has
written
articles
upon
the
subject."
"Really!"
said
Lady
Rossiter.
"Then
you
must
have
heard
of
my
husband.
Everyone
who
knows
anything
about
beetles
must
have
heard
of
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter."
For
the
first
time
a
thin
little
ray
of
light
began
to
break
into
the
obscure
business.
Here,
at
last,
was
a
connection
between
these
people
and
beetles.
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter
he
was
the
greatest
authority
upon
the
subject
in
the
world.
He
had
made
it
his
lifelong
study,
and
had
written
a
most
exhaustive
work
upon
it.
I
hastened
to
assure
her
that
I
had
read
and
appreciated
it.
"Have
you
met
my
husband?"
she
asked.
"No,
I
have
not."
"But
you
shall,"
said
Lord
Linchmere,
with
decision.
The
lady
was
standing
beside
the
desk,
and
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder.
It
was
obvious
to
me
as
I
saw
their
faces
together
that
they
were
brother
and
sister.
"Are
you
really
prepared
for
this,
Charles?
It
is
noble
of
you,
but
you
fill
me
with
fears."
Her
voice
quavered
with
apprehension,
and
he
appeared
to
me
to
be
equally
moved,
though
he
was
making
strong
efforts
to
conceal
his
agitation.
"Yes,
yes,
dear;
it
is
all
settled,
it
is
all
decided;
in
fact,
there
is
no
other
possible
way,
that
I
can
see."
"There
is
one
obvious
way."
"No,
no,
Evelyn,
I
shall
never
abandon
you
never.
It
will
come
right
depend
upon
it;
it
will
come
right,
and
surely
it
looks
like
the
interference
of
Providence
that
so
perfect
an
instrument
should
be
put
into
our
hands."
My
position
was
embarrassing,
for
I
felt
that
for
the
instant
they
had
forgotten
my
presence.
But
Lord
Linchmere
came
back
suddenly
to
me
and
to
my
engagement.
"The
business
for
which
I
want
you,
Dr.
Hamilton,
is
that
you
should
put
yourself
absolutely
at
my
disposal.
I
wish
you
to
come
for
a
short
journey
with
me,
to
remain
always
at
my
side,
and
to
promise
to
do
without
question
whatever
I
may
ask
you,
however
unreasonable
it
may
appear
to
you
to
be."
"That
is
a
good
deal
to
ask,"
said
I.
"Unfortunately
I
cannot
put
it
more
plainly,
for
I
do
not
myself
know
what
turn
matters
may
take.
You
may
be
sure,
however,
that
you
will
not
be
asked
to
do
anything
which
your
conscience
does
not
approve;
and
I
promise
you
that,
when
all
is
over,
you
will
be
proud
to
have
been
concerned
in
so
good
a
work."
"If
it
ends
happily,"
said
the
lady.
"Exactly;
if
it
ends
happily,"
his
lordship
repeated.
"And
terms?"
I
asked.
"Twenty
pounds
a
day."
I
was
amazed
at
the
sum,
and
must
have
showed
my
surprise
upon
my
features.
"It
is
a
rare
combination
of
qualities,
as
must
have
struck
you
when
you
first
read
the
advertisement,"
said
Lord
Linchmere;
"such
varied
gifts
may
well
command
a
high
return,
and
I
do
not
conceal
from
you
that
your
duties
might
be
arduous
or
even
dangerous.
Besides,
it
is
possible
that
one
or
two
days
may
bring
the
matter
to
an
end."
"Please
God!"
sighed
his
sister.
"So
now,
Dr.
Hamilton,
may
I
rely
upon
your
aid?"
"Most
undoubtedly,"
said
I.
"You
have
only
to
tell
me
what
my
duties
are."
"Your
first
duty
will
be
to
return
to
your
home.
You
will
pack
up
whatever
you
may
need
for
a
short
visit
to
the
country.
We
start
together
from
Paddington
Station
at
3:40
this
afternoon."
"Do
we
go
far?"
"As
far
as
Pangbourne.
Meet
me
at
the
bookstall
at
3:30.
I
shall
have
the
tickets.
Goodbye,
Dr.
Hamilton!
And,
by
the
way,
there
are
two
things
which
I
should
be
very
glad
if
you
would
bring
with
you,
in
case
you
have
them.
One
is
your
case
for
collecting
beetles,
and
the
other
is
a
stick,
and
the
