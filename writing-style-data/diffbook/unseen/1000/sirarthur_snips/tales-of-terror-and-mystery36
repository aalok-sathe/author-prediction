had
occurred,
when,
drawn
by
the
death
cries
of
their
master,
they
found
me
behind
the
bars,
and
his
remains
or
what
they
afterwards
discovered
to
be
his
remains
in
the
clutch
of
the
creature
which
he
had
reared.
They
stalled
him
off
with
hot
irons,
and
afterwards
shot
him
through
the
loophole
of
the
door
before
they
could
finally
extricate
me.
I
was
carried
to
my
bedroom,
and
there,
under
the
roof
of
my
would
be
murderer,
I
remained
between
life
and
death
for
several
weeks.
They
had
sent
for
a
surgeon
from
Clipton
and
a
nurse
from
London,
and
in
a
month
I
was
able
to
be
carried
to
the
station,
and
so
conveyed
back
once
more
to
Grosvenor
Mansions.
I
have
one
remembrance
of
that
illness,
which
might
have
been
part
of
the
ever
changing
panorama
conjured
up
by
a
delirious
brain
were
it
not
so
definitely
fixed
in
my
memory.
One
night,
when
the
nurse
was
absent,
the
door
of
my
chamber
opened,
and
a
tall
woman
in
blackest
mourning
slipped
into
the
room.
She
came
across
to
me,
and
as
she
bent
her
sallow
face
I
saw
by
the
faint
gleam
of
the
night
light
that
it
was
the
Brazilian
woman
whom
my
cousin
had
married.
She
stared
intently
into
my
face,
and
her
expression
was
more
kindly
than
I
had
ever
seen
it.
"Are
you
conscious?"
she
asked.
I
feebly
nodded
for
I
was
still
very
weak.
"Well;
then,
I
only
wished
to
say
to
you
that
you
have
yourself
to
blame.
Did
I
not
do
all
I
could
for
you?
From
the
beginning
I
tried
to
drive
you
from
the
house.
By
every
means,
short
of
betraying
my
husband,
I
tried
to
save
you
from
him.
I
knew
that
he
had
a
reason
for
bringing
you
here.
I
knew
that
he
would
never
let
you
get
away
again.
No
one
knew
him
as
I
knew
him,
who
had
suffered
from
him
so
often.
I
did
not
dare
to
tell
you
all
this.
He
would
have
killed
me.
But
I
did
my
best
for
you.
As
things
have
turned
out,
you
have
been
the
best
friend
that
I
have
ever
had.
You
have
set
me
free,
and
I
fancied
that
nothing
but
death
would
do
that.
I
am
sorry
if
you
are
hurt,
but
I
cannot
reproach
myself.
I
told
you
that
you
were
a
fool
and
a
fool
you
have
been."
She
crept
out
of
the
room,
the
bitter,
singular
woman,
and
I
was
never
destined
to
see
her
again.
With
what
remained
from
her
husband's
property
she
went
back
to
her
native
land,
and
I
have
heard
that
she
afterwards
took
the
veil
at
Pernambuco.
It
was
not
until
I
had
been
back
in
London
for
some
time
that
the
doctors
pronounced
me
to
be
well
enough
to
do
business.
It
was
not
a
very
welcome
permission
to
me,
for
I
feared
that
it
would
be
the
signal
for
an
inrush
of
creditors;
but
it
was
Summers,
my
lawyer,
who
first
took
advantage
of
it.
"I
am
very
glad
to
see
that
your
lordship
is
so
much
better,"
said
he.
"I
have
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
offer
my
congratulations."
"What
do
you
mean,
Summers?
This
is
no
time
for
joking."
"I
mean
what
I
say,"
he
answered.
"You
have
been
Lord
Southerton
for
the
last
six
weeks,
but
we
feared
that
it
would
retard
your
recovery
if
you
were
to
learn
it."
Lord
Southerton!
One
of
the
richest
peers
in
England!
I
could
not
believe
my
ears.
And
then
suddenly
I
thought
of
the
time
which
had
elapsed,
and
how
it
coincided
with
my
injuries.
"Then
Lord
Southerton
must
have
died
about
the
same
time
that
I
was
hurt?"
"His
death
occurred
upon
that
very
day."
Summers
looked
hard
at
me
as
I
spoke,
and
I
am
convinced
for
he
was
a
very
shrewd
fellow
that
he
had
guessed
the
true
state
of
the
case.
He
paused
for
a
moment
as
if
awaiting
a
confidence
from
me,
but
I
could
not
see
what
was
to
be
gained
by
exposing
such
a
family
scandal.
"Yes,
a
very
curious
coincidence,"
he
continued,
with
the
same
knowing
look.
"Of
course,
you
are
aware
that
your
cousin
Everard
King
was
the
next
heir
to
the
estates.
Now,
if
it
had
been
you
instead
of
him
who
had
been
torn
to
pieces
by
this
tiger,
or
whatever
it
was,
then
of
course
he
would
have
been
Lord
Southerton
at
the
present
moment."
"No
doubt,"
said
I.
"And
he
took
such
an
interest
in
it,"
said
Summers.
"I
happen
to
know
that
the
late
Lord
Southerton's
valet
was
in
his
pay,
and
that
he
used
to
have
telegrams
from
him
every
few
hours
to
tell
him
how
he
was
getting
on.
That
would
be
about
the
time
when
you
were
down
there.
Was
it
not
strange
that
he
should
wish
to
be
so
well
informed,
since
he
knew
that
he
was
not
the
direct
heir?"
"Very
strange,"
said
I.
"And
now,
Summers,
if
you
will
bring
me
my
bills
and
a
new
cheque
book,
we
will
begin
to
get
things
into
order."
Tales
of
Mystery
The
Lost
Special
The
confession
of
Herbert
de
Lernac,
now
lying
under
sentence
of
death
at
Marseilles,
has
thrown
a
light
upon
one
of
the
most
inexplicable
crimes
of
the
century
an
incident
which
is,
I
believe,
absolutely
unprecedented
in
the
criminal
annals
of
any
country:
Although
there
is
a
reluctance
to
discuss
the
matter
in
official
circles,
and
little
information
has
been
given
to
the
Press,
there
are
still
indications
that
the
statement
of
this
arch
criminal
is
corroborated
by
the
facts,
and
that
we
have
at
last
found
a
solution
for
a
most
astounding
business.
As
the
matter
is
eight
years
old,
and
as
its
importance
was
somewhat
obscured
by
a
political
crisis
which
was
engaging
the
public
attention
at
the
time,
it
may
be
as
well
to
state
