Johnsons
and
the
like,
may
smile
at
my
narrative,
but
the
poorer
folk
of
the
countryside
had
never
a
doubt
as
to
its
truth.
On
the
day
after
my
recovering
consciousness
they
assembled
in
their
hundreds
round
the
Blue
John
Gap.
As
the
Castleton
Courier
said:
"It
was
useless
for
our
correspondent,
or
for
any
of
the
adventurous
gentlemen
who
had
come
from
Matlock,
Buxton,
and
other
parts,
to
offer
to
descend,
to
explore
the
cave
to
the
end,
and
to
finally
test
the
extraordinary
narrative
of
Dr.
James
Hardcastle.
The
country
people
had
taken
the
matter
into
their
own
hands,
and
from
an
early
hour
of
the
morning
they
had
worked
hard
in
stopping
up
the
entrance
of
the
tunnel.
There
is
a
sharp
slope
where
the
shaft
begins,
and
great
boulders,
rolled
along
by
many
willing
hands,
were
thrust
down
it
until
the
Gap
was
absolutely
sealed.
So
ends
the
episode
which
has
caused
such
excitement
throughout
the
country.
Local
opinion
is
fiercely
divided
upon
the
subject.
On
the
one
hand
are
those
who
point
to
Dr.
Hardcastle's
impaired
health,
and
to
the
possibility
of
cerebral
lesions
of
tubercular
origin
giving
rise
to
strange
hallucinations.
Some
idee
fixe,
according
to
these
gentlemen,
caused
the
doctor
to
wander
down
the
tunnel,
and
a
fall
among
the
rocks
was
sufficient
to
account
for
his
injuries.
On
the
other
hand,
a
legend
of
a
strange
creature
in
the
Gap
has
existed
for
some
months
back,
and
the
farmers
look
upon
Dr.
Hardcastle's
narrative
and
his
personal
injuries
as
a
final
corroboration.
So
the
matter
stands,
and
so
the
matter
will
continue
to
stand,
for
no
definite
solution
seems
to
us
to
be
now
possible.
It
transcends
human
wit
to
give
any
scientific
explanation
which
could
cover
the
alleged
facts."
Perhaps
before
the
Courier
published
these
words
they
would
have
been
wise
to
send
their
representative
to
me.
I
have
thought
the
matter
out,
as
no
one
else
has
occasion
to
do,
and
it
is
possible
that
I
might
have
removed
some
of
the
more
obvious
difficulties
of
the
narrative
and
brought
it
one
degree
nearer
to
scientific
acceptance.
Let
me
then
write
down
the
only
explanation
which
seems
to
me
to
elucidate
what
I
know
to
my
cost
to
have
been
a
series
of
facts.
My
theory
may
seem
to
be
wildly
improbable,
but
at
least
no
one
can
venture
to
say
that
it
is
impossible.
My
view
is
and
it
was
formed,
as
is
shown
by
my
diary,
before
my
personal
adventure
that
in
this
part
of
England
there
is
a
vast
subterranean
lake
or
sea,
which
is
fed
by
the
great
number
of
streams
which
pass
down
through
the
limestone.
Where
there
is
a
large
collection
of
water
there
must
also
be
some
evaporation,
mists
or
rain,
and
a
possibility
of
vegetation.
This
in
turn
suggests
that
there
may
be
animal
life,
arising,
as
the
vegetable
life
would
also
do,
from
those
seeds
and
types
which
had
been
introduced
at
an
early
period
of
the
world's
history,
when
communication
with
the
outer
air
was
more
easy.
This
place
had
then
developed
a
fauna
and
flora
of
its
own,
including
such
monsters
as
the
one
which
I
had
seen,
which
may
well
have
been
the
old
cave
bear,
enormously
enlarged
and
modified
by
its
new
environment.
For
countless
aeons
the
internal
and
the
external
creation
had
kept
apart,
growing
steadily
away
from
each
other.
Then
there
had
come
some
rift
in
the
depths
of
the
mountain
which
had
enabled
one
creature
to
wander
up
and,
by
means
of
the
Roman
tunnel,
to
reach
the
open
air.
Like
all
subterranean
life,
it
had
lost
the
power
of
sight,
but
this
had
no
doubt
been
compensated
for
by
nature
in
other
directions.
Certainly
it
had
some
means
of
finding
its
way
about,
and
of
hunting
down
the
sheep
upon
the
hillside.
As
to
its
choice
of
dark
nights,
it
is
part
of
my
theory
that
light
was
painful
to
those
great
white
eyeballs,
and
that
it
was
only
a
pitch
black
world
which
it
could
tolerate.
Perhaps,
indeed,
it
was
the
glare
of
my
lantern
which
saved
my
life
at
that
awful
moment
when
we
were
face
to
face.
So
I
read
the
riddle.
I
leave
these
facts
behind
me,
and
if
you
can
explain
them,
do
so;
or
if
you
choose
to
doubt
them,
do
so.
Neither
your
belief
nor
your
incredulity
can
alter
them,
nor
affect
one
whose
task
is
nearly
over.
So
ended
the
strange
narrative
of
Dr.
James
Hardcastle.
The
Brazilian
Cat
It
is
hard
luck
on
a
young
fellow
to
have
expensive
tastes,
great
expectations,
aristocratic
connections,
but
no
actual
money
in
his
pocket,
and
no
profession
by
which
he
may
earn
any.
The
fact
was
that
my
father,
a
good,
sanguine,
easy
going
man,
had
such
confidence
in
the
wealth
and
benevolence
of
his
bachelor
elder
brother,
Lord
Southerton,
that
he
took
it
for
granted
that
I,
his
only
son,
would
never
be
called
upon
to
earn
a
living
for
myself.
He
imagined
that
if
there
were
not
a
vacancy
for
me
on
the
great
Southerton
Estates,
at
least
there
would
be
found
some
post
in
that
diplomatic
service
which
still
remains
the
special
preserve
of
our
privileged
classes.
He
died
too
early
to
realize
how
false
his
calculations
had
been.
Neither
my
uncle
nor
the
State
took
the
slightest
notice
of
me,
or
showed
any
interest
in
my
career.
An
occasional
brace
of
pheasants,
or
basket
of
hares,
was
all
that
ever
reached
me
to
remind
me
that
I
was
heir
to
Otwell
House
and
one
of
the
richest
estates
in
the
country.
In
the
meantime,
I
found
myself
a
bachelor
and
man
about
town,
living
in
a
suite
of
apartments
in
Grosvenor
Mansions,
with
no
occupation
save
that
of
pigeon
shooting
and
polo
playing
at
Hurlingham.
Month
by
month
I
realized
that
it
was
more
and
more
difficult
to
get
the
brokers
to
renew
