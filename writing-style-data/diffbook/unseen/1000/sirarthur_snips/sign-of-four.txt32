gray.
His
face
in
repose
was
not
an
unpleasing
one,
though
his
heavy
brows
and
aggressive
chin
gave
him,
as
I
had
lately
seen,
a
terrible
expression
when
moved
to
anger.
He
sat
now
with
his
handcuffed
hands
upon
his
lap,
and
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast,
while
he
looked
with
his
keen,
twinkling
eyes
at
the
box
which
had
been
the
cause
of
his
ill
doings.
It
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
more
sorrow
than
anger
in
his
rigid
and
contained
countenance.
Once
he
looked
up
at
me
with
a
gleam
of
something
like
humor
in
his
eyes.
"Well,
Jonathan
Small,"
said
Holmes,
lighting
a
cigar,
"I
am
sorry
that
it
has
come
to
this."
"And
so
am
I,
sir,"
he
answered,
frankly.
"I
don't
believe
that
I
can
swing
over
the
job.
I
give
you
my
word
on
the
book
that
I
never
raised
hand
against
Mr.
Sholto.
It
was
that
little
hell
hound
Tonga
who
shot
one
of
his
cursed
darts
into
him.
I
had
no
part
in
it,
sir.
I
was
as
grieved
as
if
it
had
been
my
blood
relation.
I
welted
the
little
devil
with
the
slack
end
of
the
rope
for
it,
but
it
was
done,
and
I
could
not
undo
it
again."
"Have
a
cigar,"
said
Holmes;
"and
you
had
best
take
a
pull
out
of
my
flask,
for
you
are
very
wet.
How
could
you
expect
so
small
and
weak
a
man
as
this
black
fellow
to
overpower
Mr.
Sholto
and
hold
him
while
you
were
climbing
the
rope?"
"You
seem
to
know
as
much
about
it
as
if
you
were
there,
sir.
The
truth
is
that
I
hoped
to
find
the
room
clear.
I
knew
the
habits
of
the
house
pretty
well,
and
it
was
the
time
when
Mr.
Sholto
usually
went
down
to
his
supper.
I
shall
make
no
secret
of
the
business.
The
best
defence
that
I
can
make
is
just
the
simple
truth.
Now,
if
it
had
been
the
old
major
I
would
have
swung
for
him
with
a
light
heart.
I
would
have
thought
no
more
of
knifing
him
than
of
smoking
this
cigar.
But
it's
cursed
hard
that
I
should
be
lagged
over
this
young
Sholto,
with
whom
I
had
no
quarrel
whatever."
"You
are
under
the
charge
of
Mr.
Athelney
Jones,
of
Scotland
Yard.
He
is
going
to
bring
you
up
to
my
rooms,
and
I
shall
ask
you
for
a
true
account
of
the
matter.
You
must
make
a
clean
breast
of
it,
for
if
you
do
I
hope
that
I
may
be
of
use
to
you.
I
think
I
can
prove
that
the
poison
acts
so
quickly
that
the
man
was
dead
before
ever
you
reached
the
room."
"That
he
was,
sir.
I
never
got
such
a
turn
in
my
life
as
when
I
saw
him
grinning
at
me
with
his
head
on
his
shoulder
as
I
climbed
through
the
window.
It
fairly
shook
me,
sir.
I'd
have
half
killed
Tonga
for
it
if
he
had
not
scrambled
off.
That
was
how
he
came
to
leave
his
club,
and
some
of
his
darts
too,
as
he
tells
me,
which
I
dare
say
helped
to
put
you
on
our
track;
though
how
you
kept
on
it
is
more
than
I
can
tell.
I
don't
feel
no
malice
against
you
for
it.
But
it
does
seem
a
queer
thing,"
he
added,
with
a
bitter
smile,
"that
I
who
have
a
fair
claim
to
nigh
upon
half
a
million
of
money
should
spend
the
first
half
of
my
life
building
a
breakwater
in
the
Andamans,
and
am
like
to
spend
the
other
half
digging
drains
at
Dartmoor.
It
was
an
evil
day
for
me
when
first
I
clapped
eyes
upon
the
merchant
Achmet
and
had
to
do
with
the
Agra
treasure,
which
never
brought
anything
but
a
curse
yet
upon
the
man
who
owned
it.
To
him
it
brought
murder,
to
Major
Sholto
it
brought
fear
and
guilt,
to
me
it
has
meant
slavery
for
life."
At
this
moment
Athelney
Jones
thrust
his
broad
face
and
heavy
shoulders
into
the
tiny
cabin.
"Quite
a
family
party,"
he
remarked.
"I
think
I
shall
have
a
pull
at
that
flask,
Holmes.
Well,
I
think
we
may
all
congratulate
each
other.
Pity
we
didn't
take
the
other
alive;
but
there
was
no
choice.
I
say,
Holmes,
you
must
confess
that
you
cut
it
rather
fine.
It
was
all
we
could
do
to
overhaul
her."
"All
is
well
that
ends
well,"
said
Holmes.
"But
I
certainly
did
not
know
that
the
Aurora
was
such
a
clipper."
"Smith
says
she
is
one
of
the
fastest
launches
on
the
river,
and
that
if
he
had
had
another
man
to
help
him
with
the
engines
we
should
never
have
caught
her.
He
swears
he
knew
nothing
of
this
Norwood
business."
"Neither
he
did,"
cried
our
prisoner,
"not
a
word.
I
chose
his
launch
because
I
heard
that
she
was
a
flier.
We
told
him
nothing,
but
we
paid
him
well,
and
he
was
to
get
something
handsome
if
we
reached
our
vessel,
the
Esmeralda,
at
Gravesend,
outward
bound
for
the
Brazils."
"Well,
if
he
has
done
no
wrong
we
shall
see
that
no
wrong
comes
to
him.
If
we
are
pretty
quick
in
catching
our
men,
we
are
not
so
quick
in
condemning
them."
It
was
amusing
to
notice
how
the
consequential
Jones
was
already
beginning
to
give
himself
airs
on
the
strength
of
the
capture.
From
the
slight
smile
which
played
over
Sherlock
Holmes's
face,
I
could
see
that
the
speech
had
not
been
lost
upon
him.
"We
will
be
at
Vauxhall
Bridge
presently,"
said
Jones,
"and
shall
land
you,
Dr.
Watson,
with
the
treasure
box.
I
need
hardly
tell
you
that
I
am
taking
a
very
grave
responsibility
upon
myself
in
doing
this.
It
is
most
irregular;
but
of
course
an
agreement
is
an
agreement.
I
must,
however,
as
a
matter
of
duty,
send
an
inspector
with
you,
