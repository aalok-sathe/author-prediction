business."
A
door
opened
out
of
the
passage
which
was
the
private
entrance
from
his
rooms
into
the
museum.
This
he
opened
softly
with
his
key,
having
first
kicked
off
his
shoes,
an
example
which
I
followed.
We
crept
together
through
room
after
room,
until
the
large
hall
lay
before
us,
with
that
dark
figure
still
stooping
and
working
at
the
central
case.
With
an
advance
as
cautious
as
his
own
we
closed
in
upon
him,
but
softly
as
we
went
we
could
not
take
him
entirely
unawares.
We
were
still
a
dozen
yards
from
him
when
he
looked
round
with
a
start,
and
uttering
a
husky
cry
of
terror,
ran
frantically
down
the
museum.
"Simpson!
Simpson!"
roared
Mortimer,
and
far
away
down
the
vista
of
electric
lighted
doors
we
saw
the
stiff
figure
of
the
old
soldier
suddenly
appear.
Professor
Andreas
saw
him
also,
and
stopped
running,
with
a
gesture
of
despair.
At
the
same
instant
we
each
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder.
"Yes,
yes,
gentlemen,"
he
panted,
"I
will
come
with
you.
To
your
room,
Mr.
Ward
Mortimer,
if
you
please!
I
feel
that
I
owe
you
an
explanation."
My
companion's
indignation
was
so
great
that
I
could
see
that
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
reply.
We
walked
on
each
side
of
the
old
Professor,
the
astonished
commissionaire
bringing
up
the
rear.
When
we
reached
the
violated
case,
Mortimer
stopped
and
examined
the
breastplate.
Already
one
of
the
stones
of
the
lower
row
had
had
its
setting
turned
back
in
the
same
manner
as
the
others.
My
friend
held
it
up
and
glanced
furiously
at
his
prisoner.
"How
could
you!"
he
cried.
"How
could
you!"
"It
is
horrible
horrible!"
said
the
Professor.
"I
don't
wonder
at
your
feelings.
Take
me
to
your
room."
"But
this
shall
not
be
left
exposed!"
cried
Mortimer.
He
picked
the
breastplate
up
and
carried
it
tenderly
in
his
hand,
while
I
walked
beside
the
Professor,
like
a
policeman
with
a
malefactor.
We
passed
into
Mortimer's
chambers,
leaving
the
amazed
old
soldier
to
understand
matters
as
best
he
could.
The
Professor
sat
down
in
Mortimer's
arm
chair,
and
turned
so
ghastly
a
colour
that
for
the
instant
all
our
resentment
was
changed
to
concern.
A
stiff
glass
of
brandy
brought
the
life
back
to
him
once
more.
"There,
I
am
better
now!"
said
he.
"These
last
few
days
have
been
too
much
for
me.
I
am
convinced
that
I
could
not
stand
it
any
longer.
It
is
a
nightmare
a
horrible
nightmare
that
I
should
be
arrested
as
a
burglar
in
what
has
been
for
so
long
my
own
museum.
And
yet
I
cannot
blame
you.
You
could
not
have
done
otherwise.
My
hope
always
was
that
I
should
get
it
all
over
before
I
was
detected.
This
would
have
been
my
last
night's
work."
"How
did
you
get
in?"
asked
Mortimer.
"By
taking
a
very
great
liberty
with
your
private
door.
But
the
object
justified
it.
The
object
justified
everything.
You
will
not
be
angry
when
you
know
everything
at
least,
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me.
I
had
a
key
to
your
side
door
and
also
to
the
museum
door.
I
did
not
give
them
up
when
I
left.
And
so
you
see
it
was
not
difficult
for
me
to
let
myself
into
the
museum.
I
used
to
come
in
early
before
the
crowd
had
cleared
from
the
street.
Then
I
hid
myself
in
the
mummy
case,
and
took
refuge
there
whenever
Simpson
came
round.
I
could
always
hear
him
coming.
I
used
to
leave
in
the
same
way
as
I
came."
"You
ran
a
risk."
"I
had
to."
"But
why?
What
on
earth
was
your
object
YOU
to
do
a
thing
like
that!"
Mortimer
pointed
reproachfully
at
the
plate
which
lay
before
him
on
the
table.
"I
could
devise
no
other
means.
I
thought
and
thought,
but
there
was
no
alternate
except
a
hideous
public
scandal,
and
a
private
sorrow
which
would
have
clouded
our
lives.
I
acted
for
the
best,
incredible
as
it
may
seem
to
you,
and
I
only
ask
your
attention
to
enable
me
to
prove
it."
"I
will
hear
what
you
have
to
say
before
I
take
any
further
steps,"
said
Mortimer,
grimly.
"I
am
determined
to
hold
back
nothing,
and
to
take
you
both
completely
into
my
confidence.
I
will
leave
it
to
your
own
generosity
how
far
you
will
use
the
facts
with
which
I
supply
you."
"We
have
the
essential
facts
already."
"And
yet
you
understand
nothing.
Let
me
go
back
to
what
passed
a
few
weeks
ago,
and
I
will
make
it
all
clear
to
you.
Believe
me
that
what
I
say
is
the
absolute
and
exact
truth.
"You
have
met
the
person
who
calls
himself
Captain
Wilson.
I
say
'calls
himself'
because
I
have
reason
now
to
believe
that
it
is
not
his
correct
name.
It
would
take
me
too
long
if
I
were
to
describe
all
the
means
by
which
he
obtained
an
introduction
to
me
and
ingratiated
himself
into
my
friendship
and
the
affection
of
my
daughter.
He
brought
letters
from
foreign
colleagues
which
compelled
me
to
show
him
some
attention.
And
then,
by
his
own
attainments,
which
are
considerable,
he
succeeded
in
making
himself
a
very
welcome
visitor
at
my
rooms.
When
I
learned
that
my
daughter's
affections
had
been
gained
by
him,
I
may
have
thought
it
premature,
but
I
certainly
was
not
surprised,
for
he
had
a
charm
of
manner
and
of
conversation
which
would
have
made
him
conspicuous
in
any
society.
"He
was
much
interested
in
Oriental
antiquities,
and
his
knowledge
of
the
subject
justified
his
interest.
Often
when
he
spent
the
evening
with
us
he
would
ask
permission
to
go
down
into
the
museum
and
have
an
opportunity
of
privately
inspecting
the
various
specimens.
You
can
imagine
that
I,
as
an
enthusiast,
was
in
sympathy
with
such
a
request,
and
that
I
felt
no
surprise
at
the
constancy
of
his
visits.
