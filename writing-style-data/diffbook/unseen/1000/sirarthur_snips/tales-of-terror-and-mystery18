time
of
this
little
incident.
Those
who
knew
him
best
were
aware
that
famous
as
he
was
as
a
surgeon,
he
might
have
succeeded
with
even
greater
rapidity
in
any
of
a
dozen
lines
of
life.
He
could
have
cut
his
way
to
fame
as
a
soldier,
struggled
to
it
as
an
explorer,
bullied
for
it
in
the
courts,
or
built
it
out
of
stone
and
iron
as
an
engineer.
He
was
born
to
be
great,
for
he
could
plan
what
another
man
dare
not
do,
and
he
could
do
what
another
man
dare
not
plan.
In
surgery
none
could
follow
him.
His
nerve,
his
judgement,
his
intuition,
were
things
apart.
Again
and
again
his
knife
cut
away
death,
but
grazed
the
very
springs
of
life
in
doing
it,
until
his
assistants
were
as
white
as
the
patient.
His
energy,
his
audacity,
his
full
blooded
self
confidence
does
not
the
memory
of
them
still
linger
to
the
south
of
Marylebone
Road
and
the
north
of
Oxford
Street?
His
vices
were
as
magnificent
as
his
virtues,
and
infinitely
more
picturesque.
Large
as
was
his
income,
and
it
was
the
third
largest
of
all
professional
men
in
London,
it
was
far
beneath
the
luxury
of
his
living.
Deep
in
his
complex
nature
lay
a
rich
vein
of
sensualism,
at
the
sport
of
which
he
placed
all
the
prizes
of
his
life.
The
eye,
the
ear,
the
touch,
the
palate,
all
were
his
masters.
The
bouquet
of
old
vintages,
the
scent
of
rare
exotics,
the
curves
and
tints
of
the
daintiest
potteries
of
Europe,
it
was
to
these
that
the
quick
running
stream
of
gold
was
transformed.
And
then
there
came
his
sudden
mad
passion
for
Lady
Sannox,
when
a
single
interview
with
two
challenging
glances
and
a
whispered
word
set
him
ablaze.
She
was
the
loveliest
woman
in
London
and
the
only
one
to
him.
He
was
one
of
the
handsomest
men
in
London,
but
not
the
only
one
to
her.
She
had
a
liking
for
new
experiences,
and
was
gracious
to
most
men
who
wooed
her.
It
may
have
been
cause
or
it
may
have
been
effect
that
Lord
Sannox
looked
fifty,
though
he
was
but
six
and
thirty.
He
was
a
quiet,
silent,
neutral
tinted
man,
this
lord,
with
thin
lips
and
heavy
eyelids,
much
given
to
gardening,
and
full
of
home
like
habits.
He
had
at
one
time
been
fond
of
acting,
had
even
rented
a
theatre
in
London,
and
on
its
boards
had
first
seen
Miss
Marion
Dawson,
to
whom
he
had
offered
his
hand,
his
title,
and
the
third
of
a
county.
Since
his
marriage
his
early
hobby
had
become
distasteful
to
him.
Even
in
private
theatricals
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
persuade
him
to
exercise
the
talent
which
he
had
often
showed
that
he
possessed.
He
was
happier
with
a
spud
and
a
watering
can
among
his
orchids
and
chrysanthemums.
It
was
quite
an
interesting
problem
whether
he
was
absolutely
devoid
of
sense,
or
miserably
wanting
in
spirit.
Did
he
know
his
lady's
ways
and
condone
them,
or
was
he
a
mere
blind,
doting
fool?
It
was
a
point
to
be
discussed
over
the
teacups
in
snug
little
drawing
rooms,
or
with
the
aid
of
a
cigar
in
the
bow
windows
of
clubs.
Bitter
and
plain
were
the
comments
among
men
upon
his
conduct.
There
was
but
one
who
had
a
good
word
to
say
for
him,
and
he
was
the
most
silent
member
in
the
smoking
room.
He
had
seen
him
break
in
a
horse
at
the
University,
and
it
seemed
to
have
left
an
impression
upon
his
mind.
But
when
Douglas
Stone
became
the
favourite
all
doubts
as
to
Lord
Sannox's
knowledge
or
ignorance
were
set
for
ever
at
rest.
There
was
no
subterfuge
about
Stone.
In
his
high
handed,
impetuous
fashion,
he
set
all
caution
and
discretion
at
defiance.
The
scandal
became
notorious.
A
learned
body
intimated
that
his
name
had
been
struck
from
the
list
of
its
vice
presidents.
Two
friends
implored
him
to
consider
his
professional
credit.
He
cursed
them
all
three,
and
spent
forty
guineas
on
a
bangle
to
take
with
him
to
the
lady.
He
was
at
her
house
every
evening,
and
she
drove
in
his
carriage
in
the
afternoons.
There
was
not
an
attempt
on
either
side
to
conceal
their
relations;
but
there
came
at
last
a
little
incident
to
interrupt
them.
It
was
a
dismal
winter's
night,
very
cold
and
gusty,
with
the
wind
whooping
in
the
chimneys
and
blustering
against
the
window
panes.
A
thin
spatter
of
rain
tinkled
on
the
glass
with
each
fresh
sough
of
the
gale,
drowning
for
the
instant
the
dull
gurgle
and
drip
from
the
eaves.
Douglas
Stone
had
finished
his
dinner,
and
sat
by
his
fire
in
the
study,
a
glass
of
rich
port
upon
the
malachite
table
at
his
elbow.
As
he
raised
it
to
his
lips,
he
held
it
up
against
the
lamplight,
and
watched
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
the
tiny
scales
of
beeswing
which
floated
in
its
rich
ruby
depths.
The
fire,
as
it
spurted
up,
threw
fitful
lights
upon
his
bald,
clear
cut
face,
with
its
widely
opened
grey
eyes,
its
thick
and
yet
firm
lips,
and
the
deep,
square
jaw,
which
had
something
Roman
in
its
strength
and
its
animalism.
He
smiled
from
time
to
time
as
he
nestled
back
in
his
luxurious
chair.
Indeed,
he
had
a
right
to
feel
well
pleased,
for,
against
the
advice
of
six
colleagues,
he
had
performed
an
operation
that
day
of
which
only
two
cases
were
on
record,
and
the
result
had
been
brilliant
beyond
all
expectation.
No
other
man
in
London
would
have
had
the
daring
to
plan,
or
the
skill
to
execute,
such
a
heroic
measure.
But
he
had
promised
Lady
Sannox
to
see
her
that
evening
and
it
was
already
half
past
eight.
His
hand
was
outstretched
to
the
bell
to
order
the
carriage
when
he
heard
the
dull
thud
of
the
