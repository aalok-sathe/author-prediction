be
disregarded.
Besides
these,
however,
there
are
seven
which
have,
or
have
had,
proper
lines
running
down
and
connecting
with
points
to
the
main
line,
so
as
to
convey
their
produce
from
the
mouth
of
the
mine
to
the
great
centres
of
distribution.
In
every
case
these
lines
are
only
a
few
miles
in
length.
Out
of
the
seven,
four
belong
to
collieries
which
are
worked
out,
or
at
least
to
shafts
which
are
no
longer
used.
These
are
the
Redgauntlet,
Hero,
Slough
of
Despond,
and
Heartsease
mines,
the
latter
having
ten
years
ago
been
one
of
the
principal
mines
in
Lancashire.
These
four
side
lines
may
be
eliminated
from
our
inquiry,
for,
to
prevent
possible
accidents,
the
rails
nearest
to
the
main
line
have
been
taken
up,
and
there
is
no
longer
any
connection.
There
remain
three
other
side
lines
leading
(a)
To
the
Carnstock
Iron
Works;
(b)
To
the
Big
Ben
Colliery;
(c)
To
the
Perseverance
Colliery.
"Of
these
the
Big
Ben
line
is
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long,
and
ends
at
a
dead
wall
of
coal
waiting
removal
from
the
mouth
of
the
mine.
Nothing
had
been
seen
or
heard
there
of
any
special.
The
Carnstock
Iron
Works
line
was
blocked
all
day
upon
the
3rd
of
June
by
sixteen
truckloads
of
hematite.
It
is
a
single
line,
and
nothing
could
have
passed.
As
to
the
Perseverance
line,
it
is
a
large
double
line,
which
does
a
considerable
traffic,
for
the
output
of
the
mine
is
very
large.
On
the
3rd
of
June
this
traffic
proceeded
as
usual;
hundreds
of
men
including
a
gang
of
railway
platelayers
were
working
along
the
two
miles
and
a
quarter
which
constitute
the
total
length
of
the
line,
and
it
is
inconceivable
that
an
unexpected
train
could
have
come
down
there
without
attracting
universal
attention.
It
may
be
remarked
in
conclusion
that
this
branch
line
is
nearer
to
St.
Helens
than
the
point
at
which
the
engine
driver
was
discovered,
so
that
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
train
was
past
that
point
before
misfortune
overtook
her.
"As
to
John
Slater,
there
is
no
clue
to
be
gathered
from
his
appearance
or
injuries.
We
can
only
say
that,
so
far
as
we
can
see,
he
met
his
end
by
falling
off
his
engine,
though
why
he
fell,
or
what
became
of
the
engine
after
his
fall,
is
a
question
upon
which
I
do
not
feel
qualified
to
offer
an
opinion."
In
conclusion,
the
inspector
offered
his
resignation
to
the
Board,
being
much
nettled
by
an
accusation
of
incompetence
in
the
London
papers.
A
month
elapsed,
during
which
both
the
police
and
the
company
prosecuted
their
inquiries
without
the
slightest
success.
A
reward
was
offered
and
a
pardon
promised
in
case
of
crime,
but
they
were
both
unclaimed.
Every
day
the
public
opened
their
papers
with
the
conviction
that
so
grotesque
a
mystery
would
at
last
be
solved,
but
week
after
week
passed
by,
and
a
solution
remained
as
far
off
as
ever.
In
broad
daylight,
upon
a
June
afternoon
in
the
most
thickly
inhabited
portion
of
England,
a
train
with
its
occupants
had
disappeared
as
completely
as
if
some
master
of
subtle
chemistry
had
volatilized
it
into
gas.
Indeed,
among
the
various
conjectures
which
were
put
forward
in
the
public
Press,
there
were
some
which
seriously
asserted
that
supernatural,
or,
at
least,
preternatural,
agencies
had
been
at
work,
and
that
the
deformed
Monsieur
Caratal
was
probably
a
person
who
was
better
known
under
a
less
polite
name.
Others
fixed
upon
his
swarthy
companion
as
being
the
author
of
the
mischief,
but
what
it
was
exactly
which
he
had
done
could
never
be
clearly
formulated
in
words.
Amongst
the
many
suggestions
put
forward
by
various
newspapers
or
private
individuals,
there
were
one
or
two
which
were
feasible
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
public.
One
which
appeared
in
The
Times,
over
the
signature
of
an
amateur
reasoner
of
some
celebrity
at
that
date,
attempted
to
deal
with
the
matter
in
a
critical
and
semi
scientific
manner.
An
extract
must
suffice,
although
the
curious
can
see
the
whole
letter
in
the
issue
of
the
3rd
of
July.
"It
is
one
of
the
elementary
principles
of
practical
reasoning,"
he
remarked,
"that
when
the
impossible
has
been
eliminated
the
residuum,
HOWEVER
IMPROBABLE,
must
contain
the
truth.
It
is
certain
that
the
train
left
Kenyon
Junction.
It
is
certain
that
it
did
not
reach
Barton
Moss.
It
is
in
the
highest
degree
unlikely,
but
still
possible,
that
it
may
have
taken
one
of
the
seven
available
side
lines.
It
is
obviously
impossible
for
a
train
to
run
where
there
are
no
rails,
and,
therefore,
we
may
reduce
our
improbables
to
the
three
open
lines,
namely
the
Carnstock
Iron
Works,
the
Big
Ben,
and
the
Perseverance.
Is
there
a
secret
society
of
colliers,
an
English
Camorra,
which
is
capable
of
destroying
both
train
and
passengers?
It
is
improbable,
but
it
is
not
impossible.
I
confess
that
I
am
unable
to
suggest
any
other
solution.
I
should
certainly
advise
the
company
to
direct
all
their
energies
towards
the
observation
of
those
three
lines,
and
of
the
workmen
at
the
end
of
them.
A
careful
supervision
of
the
pawnbrokers'
shops
of
the
district
might
possibly
bring
some
suggestive
facts
to
light."
The
suggestion
coming
from
a
recognized
authority
upon
such
matters
created
considerable
interest,
and
a
fierce
opposition
from
those
who
considered
such
a
statement
to
be
a
preposterous
libel
upon
an
honest
and
deserving
set
of
men.
The
only
answer
to
this
criticism
was
a
challenge
to
the
objectors
to
lay
any
more
feasible
explanations
before
the
public.
In
reply
to
this
two
others
were
forthcoming
(Times,
July
7th
and
9th).
The
first
suggested
that
the
train
might
have
run
off
the
metals
and
be
lying
submerged
in
the
Lancashire
and
Staffordshire
Canal,
which
runs
parallel
to
the
railway
for
some
hundred
of
yards.
This
suggestion
was
thrown
out
of
court
