the
setting
of
these
four
jewels
had
been
tampered
with.
There
remained
one
course
for
Mortimer
to
take,
and
he
took
it.
Leaving
the
police
to
continue
their
fruitless
researches,
he
asked
me
to
accompany
him
that
afternoon
in
a
visit
to
Professor
Andreas.
He
took
with
him
the
two
letters,
and
it
was
his
intention
to
openly
tax
his
predecessor
with
having
written
the
anonymous
warning,
and
to
ask
him
to
explain
the
fact
that
he
should
have
anticipated
so
exactly
that
which
had
actually
occurred.
The
Professor
was
living
in
a
small
villa
in
Upper
Norwood,
but
we
were
informed
by
the
servant
that
he
was
away
from
home.
Seeing
our
disappointment,
she
asked
us
if
we
should
like
to
see
Miss
Andreas,
and
showed
us
into
the
modest
drawing
room.
I
have
mentioned
incidentally
that
the
Professor's
daughter
was
a
very
beautiful
girl.
She
was
a
blonde,
tall
and
graceful,
with
a
skin
of
that
delicate
tint
which
the
French
call
"mat,"
the
colour
of
old
ivory,
or
of
the
lighter
petals
of
the
sulphur
rose.
I
was
shocked,
however,
as
she
entered
the
room
to
see
how
much
she
had
changed
in
the
last
fortnight.
Her
young
face
was
haggard
and
her
bright
eyes
heavy
with
trouble.
"Father
has
gone
to
Scotland,"
she
said.
"He
seems
to
be
tired,
and
has
had
a
good
deal
to
worry
him.
He
only
left
us
yesterday."
"You
look
a
little
tired
yourself,
Miss
Andreas,"
said
my
friend.
"I
have
been
so
anxious
about
father."
"Can
you
give
me
his
Scotch
address?"
"Yes,
he
is
with
his
brother,
the
Rev.
David
Andreas,
1,
Arran
Villas,
Ardrossan."
Ward
Mortimer
made
a
note
of
the
address,
and
we
left
without
saying
anything
as
to
the
object
of
our
visit.
We
found
ourselves
in
Belmore
Street
in
the
evening
in
exactly
the
same
position
in
which
we
had
been
in
the
morning.
Our
only
clue
was
the
Professor's
letter,
and
my
friend
had
made
up
his
mind
to
start
for
Ardrossan
next
day,
and
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
anonymous
letter,
when
a
new
development
came
to
alter
our
plans.
Very
early
on
the
following
morning
I
was
aroused
from
my
sleep
by
a
tap
upon
my
bedroom
door.
It
was
a
messenger
with
a
note
from
Mortimer.
"Do
come
round,"
it
said;
"the
matter
is
becoming
more
and
more
extraordinary."
When
I
obeyed
his
summons
I
found
him
pacing
excitedly
up
and
down
the
central
room,
while
the
old
soldier
who
guarded
the
premises
stood
with
military
stiffness
in
a
corner.
"My
dear
Jackson,"
he
cried,
"I
am
so
delighted
that
you
have
come,
for
this
is
a
most
inexplicable
business."
"What
has
happened,
then?"
He
waved
his
hand
towards
the
case
which
contained
the
breastplate.
"Look
at
it,"
said
he.
I
did
so,
and
could
not
restrain
a
cry
of
surprise.
The
setting
of
the
middle
row
of
precious
stones
had
been
profaned
in
the
same
manner
as
the
upper
ones.
Of
the
twelve
jewels
eight
had
been
now
tampered
with
in
this
singular
fashion.
The
setting
of
the
lower
four
was
neat
and
smooth.
The
others
jagged
and
irregular.
"Have
the
stones
been
altered?"
I
asked.
"No,
I
am
certain
that
these
upper
four
are
the
same
which
the
expert
pronounced
to
be
genuine,
for
I
observed
yesterday
that
little
discoloration
on
the
edge
of
the
emerald.
Since
they
have
not
extracted
the
upper
stones,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
the
lower
have
been
transposed.
You
say
that
you
heard
nothing,
Simpson?"
"No,
sir,"
the
commissionaire
answered.
"But
when
I
made
my
round
after
daylight
I
had
a
special
look
at
these
stones,
and
I
saw
at
once
that
someone
had
been
meddling
with
them.
Then
I
called
you,
sir,
and
told
you.
I
was
backwards
and
forwards
all
night,
and
I
never
saw
a
soul
or
heard
a
sound."
"Come
up
and
have
some
breakfast
with
me,"
said
Mortimer,
and
he
took
me
into
his
own
chambers.
"Now,
what
DO
you
think
of
this,
Jackson?"
he
asked.
"It
is
the
most
objectless,
futile,
idiotic
business
that
ever
I
heard
of.
It
can
only
be
the
work
of
a
monomaniac."
"Can
you
put
forward
any
theory?"
A
curious
idea
came
into
my
head.
"This
object
is
a
Jewish
relic
of
great
antiquity
and
sanctity,"
said
I.
"How
about
the
anti
Semitic
movement?
Could
one
conceive
that
a
fanatic
of
that
way
of
thinking
might
desecrate
"
"No,
no,
no!"
cried
Mortimer.
"That
will
never
do!
Such
a
man
might
push
his
lunacy
to
the
length
of
destroying
a
Jewish
relic,
but
why
on
earth
should
he
nibble
round
every
stone
so
carefully
that
he
can
only
do
four
stones
in
a
night?
We
must
have
a
better
solution
than
that,
and
we
must
find
it
for
ourselves,
for
I
do
not
think
that
our
inspector
is
likely
to
help
us.
First
of
all,
what
do
you
think
of
Simpson,
the
porter?"
"Have
you
any
reason
to
suspect
him?"
"Only
that
he
is
the
one
person
on
the
premises."
"But
why
should
he
indulge
in
such
wanton
destruction?
Nothing
has
been
taken
away.
He
has
no
motive."
"Mania?"
"No,
I
will
swear
to
his
sanity."
"Have
you
any
other
theory?"
"Well,
yourself,
for
example.
You
are
not
a
somnambulist,
by
any
chance?"
"Nothing
of
the
sort,
I
assure
you."
"Then
I
give
it
up."
"But
I
don't
and
I
have
a
plan
by
which
we
will
make
it
all
clear."
"To
visit
Professor
Andreas?"
"No,
we
shall
find
our
solution
nearer
than
Scotland.
I
will
tell
you
what
we
shall
do.
You
know
that
skylight
which
overlooks
the
central
hall?
We
will
leave
the
electric
lights
in
the
hall,
and
we
will
keep
watch
in
the
lumber
room,
you
and
I,
and
solve
the
mystery
for
ourselves.
If
our
mysterious
visitor
is
doing
four
stones
at
a
time,
he
has
four
still
to
do,
and
there
is
every
