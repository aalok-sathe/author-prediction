darkly
all
round
me.
A
dim
radiance
from
the
moonlight
came
through
the
farther
window,
and
against
this
lighter
background
I
saw
that
Sir
John
Bollamore
was
sitting
at
his
study
table.
His
well
set
head
and
clearly
cut
profile
were
sharply
outlined
against
the
glimmering
square
behind
him.
He
bent
as
I
watched
him,
and
I
heard
the
sharp
turning
of
a
key
and
the
rasping
of
metal
upon
metal.
As
if
in
a
dream
I
was
vaguely
conscious
that
this
was
the
japanned
box
which
stood
in
front
of
him,
and
that
he
had
drawn
something
out
of
it,
something
squat
and
uncouth,
which
now
lay
before
him
upon
the
table.
I
never
realized
it
never
occurred
to
my
bemuddled
and
torpid
brain
that
I
was
intruding
upon
his
privacy,
that
he
imagined
himself
to
be
alone
in
the
room.
And
then,
just
as
it
rushed
upon
my
horrified
perceptions,
and
I
had
half
risen
to
announce
my
presence,
I
heard
a
strange,
crisp,
metallic
clicking,
and
then
the
voice.
Yes,
it
was
a
woman's
voice;
there
could
not
be
a
doubt
of
it.
But
a
voice
so
charged
with
entreaty
and
with
yearning
love,
that
it
will
ring
for
ever
in
my
ears.
It
came
with
a
curious
faraway
tinkle,
but
every
word
was
clear,
though
faint
very
faint,
for
they
were
the
last
words
of
a
dying
woman.
"I
am
not
really
gone,
John,"
said
the
thin,
gasping
voice.
"I
am
here
at
your
very
elbow,
and
shall
be
until
we
meet
once
more.
I
die
happy
to
think
that
morning
and
night
you
will
hear
my
voice.
Oh,
John,
be
strong,
be
strong,
until
we
meet
again."
I
say
that
I
had
risen
in
order
to
announce
my
presence,
but
I
could
not
do
so
while
the
voice
was
sounding.
I
could
only
remain
half
lying,
half
sitting,
paralysed,
astounded,
listening
to
those
yearning
distant
musical
words.
And
he
he
was
so
absorbed
that
even
if
I
had
spoken
he
might
not
have
heard
me.
But
with
the
silence
of
the
voice
came
my
half
articulated
apologies
and
explanations.
He
sprang
across
the
room,
switched
on
the
electric
light,
and
in
its
white
glare
I
saw
him,
his
eyes
gleaming
with
anger,
his
face
twisted
with
passion,
as
the
hapless
charwoman
may
have
seen
him
weeks
before.
"Mr.
Colmore!"
he
cried.
"You
here!
What
is
the
meaning
of
this,
sir?"
With
halting
words
I
explained
it
all,
my
neuralgia,
the
narcotic,
my
luckless
sleep
and
singular
awakening.
As
he
listened
the
glow
of
anger
faded
from
his
face,
and
the
sad,
impassive
mask
closed
once
more
over
his
features.
"My
secret
is
yours,
Mr.
Colmore,"
said
he.
"I
have
only
myself
to
blame
for
relaxing
my
precautions.
Half
confidences
are
worse
than
no
confidences,
and
so
you
may
know
all
since
you
know
so
much.
The
story
may
go
where
you
will
when
I
have
passed
away,
but
until
then
I
rely
upon
your
sense
of
honour
that
no
human
soul
shall
hear
it
from
your
lips.
I
am
proud
still
God
help
me!
or,
at
least,
I
am
proud
enough
to
resent
that
pity
which
this
story
would
draw
upon
me.
I
have
smiled
at
envy,
and
disregarded
hatred,
but
pity
is
more
than
I
can
tolerate.
"You
have
heard
the
source
from
which
the
voice
comes
that
voice
which
has,
as
I
understand,
excited
so
much
curiosity
in
my
household.
I
am
aware
of
the
rumours
to
which
it
has
given
rise.
These
speculations,
whether
scandalous
or
superstitious,
are
such
as
I
can
disregard
and
forgive.
What
I
should
never
forgive
would
be
a
disloyal
spying
and
eavesdropping
in
order
to
satisfy
an
illicit
curiosity.
But
of
that,
Mr.
Colmore,
I
acquit
you.
"When
I
was
a
young
man,
sir,
many
years
younger
than
you
are
now,
I
was
launched
upon
town
without
a
friend
or
adviser,
and
with
a
purse
which
brought
only
too
many
false
friends
and
false
advisers
to
my
side.
I
drank
deeply
of
the
wine
of
life
if
there
is
a
man
living
who
has
drunk
more
deeply
he
is
not
a
man
whom
I
envy.
My
purse
suffered,
my
character
suffered,
my
constitution
suffered,
stimulants
became
a
necessity
to
me,
I
was
a
creature
from
whom
my
memory
recoils.
And
it
was
at
that
time,
the
time
of
my
blackest
degradation,
that
God
sent
into
my
life
the
gentlest,
sweetest
spirit
that
ever
descended
as
a
ministering
angel
from
above.
She
loved
me,
broken
as
I
was,
loved
me,
and
spent
her
life
in
making
a
man
once
more
of
that
which
had
degraded
itself
to
the
level
of
the
beasts.
"But
a
fell
disease
struck
her,
and
she
withered
away
before
my
eyes.
In
the
hour
of
her
agony
it
was
never
of
herself,
of
her
own
sufferings
and
her
own
death
that
she
thought.
It
was
all
of
me.
The
one
pang
which
her
fate
brought
to
her
was
the
fear
that
when
her
influence
was
removed
I
should
revert
to
that
which
I
had
been.
It
was
in
vain
that
I
made
oath
to
her
that
no
drop
of
wine
would
ever
cross
my
lips.
She
knew
only
too
well
the
hold
that
the
devil
had
upon
me
she
who
had
striven
so
to
loosen
it
and
it
haunted
her
night
and
day
the
thought
that
my
soul
might
again
be
within
his
grip.
"It
was
from
some
friend's
gossip
of
the
sick
room
that
she
heard
of
this
invention
this
phonograph
and
with
the
quick
insight
of
a
loving
woman
she
saw
how
she
might
use
it
for
her
ends.
She
sent
me
to
London
to
procure
the
best
which
money
could
buy.
With
her
dying
breath
she
gasped
into
it
the
words
which
have
held
me
straight
ever
since.
Lonely
and
broken,
what
else
have
I
in
all
the
world
to
uphold
me?
But
it
is
enough.
Please
God,
I
shall
face
