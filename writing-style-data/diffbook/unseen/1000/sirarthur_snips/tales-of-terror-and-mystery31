but
when
he
does
he
will
be
a
terror.
At
present
he
won't
stand
anyone
but
me
in
his
den.
Even
Baldwin,
the
groom,
dare
not
go
near
him.
As
to
me,
I
am
his
mother
and
father
in
one."
As
he
spoke
he
suddenly,
to
my
astonishment,
opened
the
door
and
slipped
in,
closing
it
instantly
behind
him.
At
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
huge,
lithe
creature
rose,
yawned
and
rubbed
its
round,
black
head
affectionately
against
his
side,
while
he
patted
and
fondled
it.
"Now,
Tommy,
into
your
cage!"
said
he.
The
monstrous
cat
walked
over
to
one
side
of
the
room
and
coiled
itself
up
under
a
grating.
Everard
King
came
out,
and
taking
the
iron
handle
which
I
have
mentioned,
he
began
to
turn
it.
As
he
did
so
the
line
of
bars
in
the
corridor
began
to
pass
through
a
slot
in
the
wall
and
closed
up
the
front
of
this
grating,
so
as
to
make
an
effective
cage.
When
it
was
in
position
he
opened
the
door
once
more
and
invited
me
into
the
room,
which
was
heavy
with
the
pungent,
musty
smell
peculiar
to
the
great
carnivora.
"That's
how
we
work
it,"
said
he.
"We
give
him
the
run
of
the
room
for
exercise,
and
then
at
night
we
put
him
in
his
cage.
You
can
let
him
out
by
turning
the
handle
from
the
passage,
or
you
can,
as
you
have
seen,
coop
him
up
in
the
same
way.
No,
no,
you
should
not
do
that!"
I
had
put
my
hand
between
the
bars
to
pat
the
glossy,
heaving
flank.
He
pulled
it
back,
with
a
serious
face.
"I
assure
you
that
he
is
not
safe.
Don't
imagine
that
because
I
can
take
liberties
with
him
anyone
else
can.
He
is
very
exclusive
in
his
friends
aren't
you,
Tommy?
Ah,
he
hears
his
lunch
coming
to
him!
Don't
you,
boy?"
A
step
sounded
in
the
stone
flagged
passage,
and
the
creature
had
sprung
to
his
feet,
and
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
narrow
cage,
his
yellow
eyes
gleaming,
and
his
scarlet
tongue
rippling
and
quivering
over
the
white
line
of
his
jagged
teeth.
A
groom
entered
with
a
coarse
joint
upon
a
tray,
and
thrust
it
through
the
bars
to
him.
He
pounced
lightly
upon
it,
carried
it
off
to
the
corner,
and
there,
holding
it
between
his
paws,
tore
and
wrenched
at
it,
raising
his
bloody
muzzle
every
now
and
then
to
look
at
us.
It
was
a
malignant
and
yet
fascinating
sight.
"You
can't
wonder
that
I
am
fond
of
him,
can
you?"
said
my
host,
as
we
left
the
room,
"especially
when
you
consider
that
I
have
had
the
rearing
of
him.
It
was
no
joke
bringing
him
over
from
the
centre
of
South
America;
but
here
he
is
safe
and
sound
and,
as
I
have
said,
far
the
most
perfect
specimen
in
Europe.
The
people
at
the
Zoo
are
dying
to
have
him,
but
I
really
can't
part
with
him.
Now,
I
think
that
I
have
inflicted
my
hobby
upon
you
long
enough,
so
we
cannot
do
better
than
follow
Tommy's
example,
and
go
to
our
lunch."
My
South
American
relative
was
so
engrossed
by
his
grounds
and
their
curious
occupants,
that
I
hardly
gave
him
credit
at
first
for
having
any
interests
outside
them.
That
he
had
some,
and
pressing
ones,
was
soon
borne
in
upon
me
by
the
number
of
telegrams
which
he
received.
They
arrived
at
all
hours,
and
were
always
opened
by
him
with
the
utmost
eagerness
and
anxiety
upon
his
face.
Sometimes
I
imagined
that
it
must
be
the
Turf,
and
sometimes
the
Stock
Exchange,
but
certainly
he
had
some
very
urgent
business
going
forwards
which
was
not
transacted
upon
the
Downs
of
Suffolk.
During
the
six
days
of
my
visit
he
had
never
fewer
than
three
or
four
telegrams
a
day,
and
sometimes
as
many
as
seven
or
eight.
I
had
occupied
these
six
days
so
well,
that
by
the
end
of
them
I
had
succeeded
in
getting
upon
the
most
cordial
terms
with
my
cousin.
Every
night
we
had
sat
up
late
in
the
billiard
room,
he
telling
me
the
most
extraordinary
stories
of
his
adventures
in
America
stories
so
desperate
and
reckless,
that
I
could
hardly
associate
them
with
the
brown
little,
chubby
man
before
me.
In
return,
I
ventured
upon
some
of
my
own
reminiscences
of
London
life,
which
interested
him
so
much,
that
he
vowed
he
would
come
up
to
Grosvenor
Mansions
and
stay
with
me.
He
was
anxious
to
see
the
faster
side
of
city
life,
and
certainly,
though
I
say
it,
he
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
competent
guide.
It
was
not
until
the
last
day
of
my
visit
that
I
ventured
to
approach
that
which
was
on
my
mind.
I
told
him
frankly
about
my
pecuniary
difficulties
and
my
impending
ruin,
and
I
asked
his
advice
though
I
hoped
for
something
more
solid.
He
listened
attentively,
puffing
hard
at
his
cigar.
"But
surely,"
said
he,
"you
are
the
heir
of
our
relative,
Lord
Southerton?"
"I
have
every
reason
to
believe
so,
but
he
would
never
make
me
any
allowance."
"No,
no,
I
have
heard
of
his
miserly
ways.
My
poor
Marshall,
your
position
has
been
a
very
hard
one.
By
the
way,
have
you
heard
any
news
of
Lord
Southerton's
health
lately?"
"He
has
always
been
in
a
critical
condition
ever
since
my
childhood."
"Exactly
a
creaking
hinge,
if
ever
there
was
one.
Your
inheritance
may
be
a
long
way
off.
Dear
me,
how
awkwardly
situated
you
are!"
"I
had
some
hopes,
sir,
that
you,
knowing
all
the
facts,
might
be
inclined
to
advance
"
"Don't
say
another
word,
my
dear
boy,"
he
cried,
with
the
utmost
cordiality;
"we
shall
talk
it
over
tonight,
and
I
give
you
my
word
that
whatever
is
in
my
power
shall
be
done."
I
was
not
sorry
that
my
visit
was
drawing
to
a
close,
for
