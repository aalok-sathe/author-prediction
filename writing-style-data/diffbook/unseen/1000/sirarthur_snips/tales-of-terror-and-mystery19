knocker.
An
instant
later
there
was
the
shuffling
of
feet
in
the
hall,
and
the
sharp
closing
of
a
door.
"A
patient
to
see
you,
sir,
in
the
consulting
room,"
said
the
butler.
"About
himself?"
"No,
sir;
I
think
he
wants
you
to
go
out."
"It
is
too
late,"
cried
Douglas
Stone
peevishly.
"I
won't
go."
"This
is
his
card,
sir."
The
butler
presented
it
upon
the
gold
salver
which
had
been
given
to
his
master
by
the
wife
of
a
Prime
Minister.
"'Hamil
Ali,
Smyrna.'
Hum!
The
fellow
is
a
Turk,
I
suppose."
"Yes,
sir.
He
seems
as
if
he
came
from
abroad,
sir.
And
he's
in
a
terrible
way."
"Tut,
tut!
I
have
an
engagement.
I
must
go
somewhere
else.
But
I'll
see
him.
Show
him
in
here,
Pim."
A
few
moments
later
the
butler
swung
open
the
door
and
ushered
in
a
small
and
decrepit
man,
who
walked
with
a
bent
back
and
with
the
forward
push
of
the
face
and
blink
of
the
eyes
which
goes
with
extreme
short
sight.
His
face
was
swarthy,
and
his
hair
and
beard
of
the
deepest
black.
In
one
hand
he
held
a
turban
of
white
muslin
striped
with
red,
in
the
other
a
small
chamois
leather
bag.
"Good
evening,"
said
Douglas
Stone,
when
the
butler
had
closed
the
door.
"You
speak
English,
I
presume?"
"Yes,
sir.
I
am
from
Asia
Minor,
but
I
speak
English
when
I
speak
slow."
"You
wanted
me
to
go
out,
I
understand?"
"Yes,
sir.
I
wanted
very
much
that
you
should
see
my
wife."
"I
could
come
in
the
morning,
but
I
have
an
engagement
which
prevents
me
from
seeing
your
wife
tonight."
The
Turk's
answer
was
a
singular
one.
He
pulled
the
string
which
closed
the
mouth
of
the
chamois
leather
bag,
and
poured
a
flood
of
gold
on
to
the
table.
"There
are
one
hundred
pounds
there,"
said
he,
"and
I
promise
you
that
it
will
not
take
you
an
hour.
I
have
a
cab
ready
at
the
door."
Douglas
Stone
glanced
at
his
watch.
An
hour
would
not
make
it
too
late
to
visit
Lady
Sannox.
He
had
been
there
later.
And
the
fee
was
an
extraordinarily
high
one.
He
had
been
pressed
by
his
creditors
lately,
and
he
could
not
afford
to
let
such
a
chance
pass.
He
would
go.
"What
is
the
case?"
he
asked.
"Oh,
it
is
so
sad
a
one!
So
sad
a
one!
You
have
not,
perhaps
heard
of
the
daggers
of
the
Almohades?"
"Never."
"Ah,
they
are
Eastern
daggers
of
a
great
age
and
of
a
singular
shape,
with
the
hilt
like
what
you
call
a
stirrup.
I
am
a
curiosity
dealer,
you
understand,
and
that
is
why
I
have
come
to
England
from
Smyrna,
but
next
week
I
go
back
once
more.
Many
things
I
brought
with
me,
and
I
have
a
few
things
left,
but
among
them,
to
my
sorrow,
is
one
of
these
daggers."
"You
will
remember
that
I
have
an
appointment,
sir,"
said
the
surgeon,
with
some
irritation;
"pray
confine
yourself
to
the
necessary
details."
"You
will
see
that
it
is
necessary.
Today
my
wife
fell
down
in
a
faint
in
the
room
in
which
I
keep
my
wares,
and
she
cut
her
lower
lip
upon
this
cursed
dagger
of
Almohades."
"I
see,"
said
Douglas
Stone,
rising.
"And
you
wish
me
to
dress
the
wound?"
"No,
no,
it
is
worse
than
that."
"What
then?"
"These
daggers
are
poisoned."
"Poisoned!"
"Yes,
and
there
is
no
man,
East
or
West,
who
can
tell
now
what
is
the
poison
or
what
the
cure.
But
all
that
is
known
I
know,
for
my
father
was
in
this
trade
before
me,
and
we
have
had
much
to
do
with
these
poisoned
weapons."
"What
are
the
symptoms?"
"Deep
sleep,
and
death
in
thirty
hours."
"And
you
say
there
is
no
cure.
Why
then
should
you
pay
me
this
considerable
fee?"
"No
drug
can
cure,
but
the
knife
may."
"And
how?"
"The
poison
is
slow
of
absorption.
It
remains
for
hours
in
the
wound."
"Washing,
then,
might
cleanse
it?"
"No
more
than
in
a
snake
bite.
It
is
too
subtle
and
too
deadly."
"Excision
of
the
wound,
then?"
"That
is
it.
If
it
be
on
the
finger,
take
the
finger
off.
So
said
my
father
always.
But
think
of
where
this
wound
is,
and
that
it
is
my
wife.
It
is
dreadful!"
But
familiarity
with
such
grim
matters
may
take
the
finer
edge
from
a
man's
sympathy.
To
Douglas
Stone
this
was
already
an
interesting
case,
and
he
brushed
aside
as
irrelevant
the
feeble
objections
of
the
husband.
"It
appears
to
be
that
or
nothing,"
said
he
brusquely.
"It
is
better
to
lose
a
lip
than
a
life."
"Ah,
yes,
I
know
that
you
are
right.
Well,
well,
it
is
kismet,
and
it
must
be
faced.
I
have
the
cab,
and
you
will
come
with
me
and
do
this
thing."
Douglas
Stone
took
his
case
of
bistouries
from
a
drawer,
and
placed
it
with
a
roll
of
bandage
and
a
compress
of
lint
in
his
pocket.
He
must
waste
no
more
time
if
he
were
to
see
Lady
Sannox.
"I
am
ready,"
said
he,
pulling
on
his
overcoat.
"Will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
before
you
go
out
into
this
cold
air?"
His
visitor
shrank
away,
with
a
protesting
hand
upraised.
"You
forget
that
I
am
a
Mussulman,
and
a
true
follower
of
the
Prophet,"
said
he.
"But
tell
me
what
is
the
bottle
of
green
glass
which
you
have
placed
in
your
pocket?"
"It
is
chloroform."
"Ah,
that
also
is
forbidden
to
us.
It
is
a
spirit,
and
we
make
no
use
of
such
things."
"What!
You
would
allow
your
wife
to
go
through
an
operation
without
an
anaesthetic?"
"Ah!
she
will
feel
nothing,
poor
soul.
The
deep
sleep
has
already
come
on,
which
is
the
first
working
of
the
poison.
And
then
I
have
given
her
of
our
Smyrna
opium.
Come,
sir,
for
already
an
