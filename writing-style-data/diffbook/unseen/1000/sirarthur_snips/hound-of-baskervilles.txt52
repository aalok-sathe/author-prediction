We
all
three
shook
hands,
and
I
saw
at
once
from
the
reverential
way
in
which
Lestrade
gazed
at
my
companion
that
he
had
learned
a
good
deal
since
the
days
when
they
had
first
worked
together.
I
could
well
remember
the
scorn
which
the
theories
of
the
reasoner
used
then
to
excite
in
the
practical
man.
"Anything
good?"
he
asked.
"The
biggest
thing
for
years,"
said
Holmes.
"We
have
two
hours
before
we
need
think
of
starting.
I
think
we
might
employ
it
in
getting
some
dinner
and
then,
Lestrade,
we
will
take
the
London
fog
out
of
your
throat
by
giving
you
a
breath
of
the
pure
night
air
of
Dartmoor.
Never
been
there?
Ah,
well,
I
don't
suppose
you
will
forget
your
first
visit."
One
of
Sherlock
Holmes's
defects
if,
indeed,
one
may
call
it
a
defect
was
that
he
was
exceedingly
loath
to
communicate
his
full
plans
to
any
other
person
until
the
instant
of
their
fulfilment.
Partly
it
came
no
doubt
from
his
own
masterful
nature,
which
loved
to
dominate
and
surprise
those
who
were
around
him.
Partly
also
from
his
professional
caution,
which
urged
him
never
to
take
any
chances.
The
result,
however,
was
very
trying
for
those
who
were
acting
as
his
agents
and
assistants.
I
had
often
suffered
under
it,
but
never
more
so
than
during
that
long
drive
in
the
darkness.
The
great
ordeal
was
in
front
of
us;
at
last
we
were
about
to
make
our
final
effort,
and
yet
Holmes
had
said
nothing,
and
I
could
only
surmise
what
his
course
of
action
would
be.
My
nerves
thrilled
with
anticipation
when
at
last
the
cold
wind
upon
our
faces
and
the
dark,
void
spaces
on
either
side
of
the
narrow
road
told
me
that
we
were
back
upon
the
moor
once
again.
Every
stride
of
the
horses
and
every
turn
of
the
wheels
was
taking
us
nearer
to
our
supreme
adventure.
Our
conversation
was
hampered
by
the
presence
of
the
driver
of
the
hired
wagonette,
so
that
we
were
forced
to
talk
of
trivial
matters
when
our
nerves
were
tense
with
emotion
and
anticipation.
It
was
a
relief
to
me,
after
that
unnatural
restraint,
when
we
at
last
passed
Frankland's
house
and
knew
that
we
were
drawing
near
to
the
Hall
and
to
the
scene
of
action.
We
did
not
drive
up
to
the
door
but
got
down
near
the
gate
of
the
avenue.
The
wagonette
was
paid
off
and
ordered
to
return
to
Coombe
Tracey
forthwith,
while
we
started
to
walk
to
Merripit
House.
"Are
you
armed,
Lestrade?"
The
little
detective
smiled.
"As
long
as
I
have
my
trousers
I
have
a
hip
pocket,
and
as
long
as
I
have
my
hip
pocket
I
have
something
in
it."
"Good!
My
friend
and
I
are
also
ready
for
emergencies."
"You're
mighty
close
about
this
affair,
Mr.
Holmes.
What's
the
game
now?"
"A
waiting
game."
"My
word,
it
does
not
seem
a
very
cheerful
place,"
said
the
detective
with
a
shiver,
glancing
round
him
at
the
gloomy
slopes
of
the
hill
and
at
the
huge
lake
of
fog
which
lay
over
the
Grimpen
Mire.
"I
see
the
lights
of
a
house
ahead
of
us."
"That
is
Merripit
House
and
the
end
of
our
journey.
I
must
request
you
to
walk
on
tiptoe
and
not
to
talk
above
a
whisper."
We
moved
cautiously
along
the
track
as
if
we
were
bound
for
the
house,
but
Holmes
halted
us
when
we
were
about
two
hundred
yards
from
it.
"This
will
do,"
said
he.
"These
rocks
upon
the
right
make
an
admirable
screen."
"We
are
to
wait
here?"
"Yes,
we
shall
make
our
little
ambush
here.
Get
into
this
hollow,
Lestrade.
You
have
been
inside
the
house,
have
you
not,
Watson?
Can
you
tell
the
position
of
the
rooms?
What
are
those
latticed
windows
at
this
end?"
"I
think
they
are
the
kitchen
windows."
"And
the
one
beyond,
which
shines
so
brightly?"
"That
is
certainly
the
dining
room."
"The
blinds
are
up.
You
know
the
lie
of
the
land
best.
Creep
forward
quietly
and
see
what
they
are
doing
but
for
heaven's
sake
don't
let
them
know
that
they
are
watched!"
I
tiptoed
down
the
path
and
stooped
behind
the
low
wall
which
surrounded
the
stunted
orchard.
Creeping
in
its
shadow
I
reached
a
point
whence
I
could
look
straight
through
the
uncurtained
window.
There
were
only
two
men
in
the
room,
Sir
Henry
and
Stapleton.
They
sat
with
their
profiles
towards
me
on
either
side
of
the
round
table.
Both
of
them
were
smoking
cigars,
and
coffee
and
wine
were
in
front
of
them.
Stapleton
was
talking
with
animation,
but
the
baronet
looked
pale
and
distrait.
Perhaps
the
thought
of
that
lonely
walk
across
the
ill
omened
moor
was
weighing
heavily
upon
his
mind.
As
I
watched
them
Stapleton
rose
and
left
the
room,
while
Sir
Henry
filled
his
glass
again
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair,
puffing
at
his
cigar.
I
heard
the
creak
of
a
door
and
the
crisp
sound
of
boots
upon
gravel.
The
steps
passed
along
the
path
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
under
which
I
crouched.
Looking
over,
I
saw
the
naturalist
pause
at
the
door
of
an
out
house
in
the
corner
of
the
orchard.
A
key
turned
in
a
lock,
and
as
he
passed
in
there
was
a
curious
scuffling
noise
from
within.
He
was
only
a
minute
or
so
inside,
and
then
I
heard
the
key
turn
once
more
and
he
passed
me
and
reentered
the
house.
I
saw
him
rejoin
his
guest,
and
I
crept
quietly
back
to
where
my
companions
were
waiting
to
tell
them
what
I
had
seen.
"You
say,
Watson,
that
the
lady
is
not
there?"
Holmes
asked
when
I
had
finished
my
report.
"No."
"Where
can
she
be,
then,
since
there
is
no
light
in
any
other
room
except
the
kitchen?"
"I
cannot
think
where
she
is."
I
have
said
that
over
the
great
Grimpen
Mire
there
