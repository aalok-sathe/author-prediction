seen.
"You
have
given
her
a
very
heavy
dose
of
opium."
"Yes,
she
has
had
a
good
dose."
He
glanced
again
at
the
dark
eyes
which
looked
straight
at
his
own.
They
were
dull
and
lustreless,
but,
even
as
he
gazed,
a
little
shifting
sparkle
came
into
them,
and
the
lips
quivered.
"She
is
not
absolutely
unconscious,"
said
he.
"Would
it
not
be
well
to
use
the
knife
while
it
will
be
painless?"
The
same
thought
had
crossed
the
surgeon's
mind.
He
grasped
the
wounded
lip
with
his
forceps,
and
with
two
swift
cuts
he
took
out
a
broad
V
shaped
piece.
The
woman
sprang
up
on
the
couch
with
a
dreadful
gurgling
scream.
Her
covering
was
torn
from
her
face.
It
was
a
face
that
he
knew.
In
spite
of
that
protruding
upper
lip
and
that
slobber
of
blood,
it
was
a
face
that
he
knew,
She
kept
on
putting
her
hand
up
to
the
gap
and
screaming.
Douglas
Stone
sat
down
at
the
foot
of
the
couch
with
his
knife
and
his
forceps.
The
room
was
whirling
round,
and
he
had
felt
something
go
like
a
ripping
seam
behind
his
ear.
A
bystander
would
have
said
that
his
face
was
the
more
ghastly
of
the
two.
As
in
a
dream,
or
as
if
he
had
been
looking
at
something
at
the
play,
he
was
conscious
that
the
Turk's
hair
and
beard
lay
upon
the
table,
and
that
Lord
Sannox
was
leaning
against
the
wall
with
his
hand
to
his
side,
laughing
silently.
The
screams
had
died
away
now,
and
the
dreadful
head
had
dropped
back
again
upon
the
pillow,
but
Douglas
Stone
still
sat
motionless,
and
Lord
Sannox
still
chuckled
quietly
to
himself.
"It
was
really
very
necessary
for
Marion,
this
operation,"
said
he,
"not
physically,
but
morally,
you
know,
morally."
Douglas
Stone
stooped
for
yards
and
began
to
play
with
the
fringe
of
the
coverlet.
His
knife
tinkled
down
upon
the
ground,
but
he
still
held
the
forceps
and
something
more.
"I
had
long
intended
to
make
a
little
example,"
said
Lord
Sannox,
suavely.
"Your
note
of
Wednesday
miscarried,
and
I
have
it
here
in
my
pocket
book.
I
took
some
pains
in
carrying
out
my
idea.
The
wound,
by
the
way,
was
from
nothing
more
dangerous
than
my
signet
ring."
He
glanced
keenly
at
his
silent
companion,
and
cocked
the
small
revolver
which
he
held
in
his
coat
pocket.
But
Douglas
Stone
was
still
picking
at
the
coverlet.
"You
see
you
have
kept
your
appointment
after
all,"
said
Lord
Sannox.
And
at
that
Douglas
Stone
began
to
laugh.
He
laughed
long
and
loudly.
But
Lord
Sannox
did
not
laugh
now.
Something
like
fear
sharpened
and
hardened
his
features.
He
walked
from
the
room,
and
he
walked
on
tiptoe.
The
old
woman
was
waiting
outside.
"Attend
to
your
mistress
when
she
awakes,"
said
Lord
Sannox.
Then
he
went
down
to
the
street.
The
cab
was
at
the
door,
and
the
driver
raised
his
hand
to
his
hat.
"John,"
said
Lord
Sannox,
"you
will
take
the
doctor
home
first.
He
will
want
leading
downstairs,
I
think.
Tell
his
butler
that
he
has
been
taken
ill
at
a
case."
"Very
good,
sir."
"Then
you
can
take
Lady
Sannox
home."
"And
how
about
yourself,
sir?"
"Oh,
my
address
for
the
next
few
months
will
be
Hotel
di
Roma,
Venice.
Just
see
that
the
letters
are
sent
on.
And
tell
Stevens
to
exhibit
all
the
purple
chrysanthemums
next
Monday,
and
to
wire
me
the
result."
The
Terror
of
Blue
John
Gap
The
following
narrative
was
found
among
the
papers
of
Dr.
James
Hardcastle,
who
died
of
phthisis
on
February
4th,
1908,
at
36,
Upper
Coventry
Flats,
South
Kensington.
Those
who
knew
him
best,
while
refusing
to
express
an
opinion
upon
this
particular
statement,
are
unanimous
in
asserting
that
he
was
a
man
of
a
sober
and
scientific
turn
of
mind,
absolutely
devoid
of
imagination,
and
most
unlikely
to
invent
any
abnormal
series
of
events.
The
paper
was
contained
in
an
envelope,
which
was
docketed,
"A
Short
Account
of
the
Circumstances
which
occurred
near
Miss
Allerton's
Farm
in
North
West
Derbyshire
in
the
Spring
of
Last
Year."
The
envelope
was
sealed,
and
on
the
other
side
was
written
in
pencil
DEAR
SEATON,
"It
may
interest,
and
perhaps
pain
you,
to
know
that
the
incredulity
with
which
you
met
my
story
has
prevented
me
from
ever
opening
my
mouth
upon
the
subject
again.
I
leave
this
record
after
my
death,
and
perhaps
strangers
may
be
found
to
have
more
confidence
in
me
than
my
friend."
Inquiry
has
failed
to
elicit
who
this
Seaton
may
have
been.
I
may
add
that
the
visit
of
the
deceased
to
Allerton's
Farm,
and
the
general
nature
of
the
alarm
there,
apart
from
his
particular
explanation,
have
been
absolutely
established.
With
this
foreword
I
append
his
account
exactly
as
he
left
it.
It
is
in
the
form
of
a
diary,
some
entries
in
which
have
been
expanded,
while
a
few
have
been
erased.
April
17.
Already
I
feel
the
benefit
of
this
wonderful
upland
air.
The
farm
of
the
Allertons
lies
fourteen
hundred
and
twenty
feet
above
sea
level,
so
it
may
well
be
a
bracing
climate.
Beyond
the
usual
morning
cough
I
have
very
little
discomfort,
and,
what
with
the
fresh
milk
and
the
home
grown
mutton,
I
have
every
chance
of
putting
on
weight.
I
think
Saunderson
will
be
pleased.
The
two
Miss
Allertons
are
charmingly
quaint
and
kind,
two
dear
little
hard
working
old
maids,
who
are
ready
to
lavish
all
the
heart
which
might
have
gone
out
to
husband
and
to
children
upon
an
invalid
stranger.
Truly,
the
old
maid
is
a
most
useful
person,
one
of
the
reserve
forces
of
the
community.
They
talk
of
the
superfluous
woman,
but
what
would
the
poor
superfluous
man
do
without
her
kindly
presence?
By
the
way,
in
their
simplicity
they
very
quickly
let
out
the
reason
why
Saunderson
recommended
their
farm.
The
Professor
rose
from
the
