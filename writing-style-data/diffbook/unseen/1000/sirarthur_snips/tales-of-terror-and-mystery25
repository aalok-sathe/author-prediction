too
much
horrified
to
move.
I
thought
of
the
sound
which
I
had
heard
coming
from
the
depths
of
the
cave,
of
Armitage's
fears,
of
the
strange
impression
in
the
mud,
and
now
came
this
final
and
absolute
proof
that
there
was
indeed
some
inconceivable
monster,
something
utterly
unearthly
and
dreadful,
which
lurked
in
the
hollow
of
the
mountain.
Of
its
nature
or
form
I
could
frame
no
conception,
save
that
it
was
both
light
footed
and
gigantic.
The
combat
between
my
reason,
which
told
me
that
such
things
could
not
be,
and
my
senses,
which
told
me
that
they
were,
raged
within
me
as
I
lay.
Finally,
I
was
almost
ready
to
persuade
myself
that
this
experience
had
been
part
of
some
evil
dream,
and
that
my
abnormal
condition
might
have
conjured
up
an
hallucination.
But
there
remained
one
final
experience
which
removed
the
last
possibility
of
doubt
from
my
mind.
I
had
taken
my
matches
from
my
armpit
and
felt
them.
They
seemed
perfectly
hard
and
dry.
Stooping
down
into
a
crevice
of
the
rocks,
I
tried
one
of
them.
To
my
delight
it
took
fire
at
once.
I
lit
the
candle,
and,
with
a
terrified
backward
glance
into
the
obscure
depths
of
the
cavern,
I
hurried
in
the
direction
of
the
Roman
passage.
As
I
did
so
I
passed
the
patch
of
mud
on
which
I
had
seen
the
huge
imprint.
Now
I
stood
astonished
before
it,
for
there
were
three
similar
imprints
upon
its
surface,
enormous
in
size,
irregular
in
outline,
of
a
depth
which
indicated
the
ponderous
weight
which
had
left
them.
Then
a
great
terror
surged
over
me.
Stooping
and
shading
my
candle
with
my
hand,
I
ran
in
a
frenzy
of
fear
to
the
rocky
archway,
hastened
up
it,
and
never
stopped
until,
with
weary
feet
and
panting
lungs,
I
rushed
up
the
final
slope
of
stones,
broke
through
the
tangle
of
briars,
and
flung
myself
exhausted
upon
the
soft
grass
under
the
peaceful
light
of
the
stars.
It
was
three
in
the
morning
when
I
reached
the
farm
house,
and
today
I
am
all
unstrung
and
quivering
after
my
terrific
adventure.
As
yet
I
have
told
no
one.
I
must
move
warily
in
the
matter.
What
would
the
poor
lonely
women,
or
the
uneducated
yokels
here
think
of
it
if
I
were
to
tell
them
my
experience?
Let
me
go
to
someone
who
can
understand
and
advise.
April
25.
I
was
laid
up
in
bed
for
two
days
after
my
incredible
adventure
in
the
cavern.
I
use
the
adjective
with
a
very
definite
meaning,
for
I
have
had
an
experience
since
which
has
shocked
me
almost
as
much
as
the
other.
I
have
said
that
I
was
looking
round
for
someone
who
could
advise
me.
There
is
a
Dr.
Mark
Johnson
who
practices
some
few
miles
away,
to
whom
I
had
a
note
of
recommendation
from
Professor
Saunderson.
To
him
I
drove,
when
I
was
strong
enough
to
get
about,
and
I
recounted
to
him
my
whole
strange
experience.
He
listened
intently,
and
then
carefully
examined
me,
paying
special
attention
to
my
reflexes
and
to
the
pupils
of
my
eyes.
When
he
had
finished,
he
refused
to
discuss
my
adventure,
saying
that
it
was
entirely
beyond
him,
but
he
gave
me
the
card
of
a
Mr.
Picton
at
Castleton,
with
the
advice
that
I
should
instantly
go
to
him
and
tell
him
the
story
exactly
as
I
had
done
to
himself.
He
was,
according
to
my
adviser,
the
very
man
who
was
pre
eminently
suited
to
help
me.
I
went
on
to
the
station,
therefore,
and
made
my
way
to
the
little
town,
which
is
some
ten
miles
away.
Mr.
Picton
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
importance,
as
his
brass
plate
was
displayed
upon
the
door
of
a
considerable
building
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town.
I
was
about
to
ring
his
bell,
when
some
misgiving
came
into
my
mind,
and,
crossing
to
a
neighbouring
shop,
I
asked
the
man
behind
the
counter
if
he
could
tell
me
anything
of
Mr.
Picton.
"Why,"
said
he,
"he
is
the
best
mad
doctor
in
Derbyshire,
and
yonder
is
his
asylum."
You
can
imagine
that
it
was
not
long
before
I
had
shaken
the
dust
of
Castleton
from
my
feet
and
returned
to
the
farm,
cursing
all
unimaginative
pedants
who
cannot
conceive
that
there
may
be
things
in
creation
which
have
never
yet
chanced
to
come
across
their
mole's
vision.
After
all,
now
that
I
am
cooler,
I
can
afford
to
admit
that
I
have
been
no
more
sympathetic
to
Armitage
than
Dr.
Johnson
has
been
to
me.
April
27.
When
I
was
a
student
I
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
man
of
courage
and
enterprise.
I
remember
that
when
there
was
a
ghost
hunt
at
Coltbridge
it
was
I
who
sat
up
in
the
haunted
house.
Is
it
advancing
years
(after
all,
I
am
only
thirty
five),
or
is
it
this
physical
malady
which
has
caused
degeneration?
Certainly
my
heart
quails
when
I
think
of
that
horrible
cavern
in
the
hill,
and
the
certainty
that
it
has
some
monstrous
occupant.
What
shall
I
do?
There
is
not
an
hour
in
the
day
that
I
do
not
debate
the
question.
If
I
say
nothing,
then
the
mystery
remains
unsolved.
If
I
do
say
anything,
then
I
have
the
alternative
of
mad
alarm
over
the
whole
countryside,
or
of
absolute
incredulity
which
may
end
in
consigning
me
to
an
asylum.
On
the
whole,
I
think
that
my
best
course
is
to
wait,
and
to
prepare
for
some
expedition
which
shall
be
more
deliberate
and
better
thought
out
than
the
last.
As
a
first
step
I
have
been
to
Castleton
and
obtained
a
few
essentials
a
large
acetylene
lantern
for
one
thing,
and
a
good
double
barrelled
sporting
rifle
for
another.
The
latter
I
have
hired,
but
I
have
bought
a
dozen
heavy
game
cartridges,
which
would
bring
down
a
rhinoceros.
Now
I
am
ready
