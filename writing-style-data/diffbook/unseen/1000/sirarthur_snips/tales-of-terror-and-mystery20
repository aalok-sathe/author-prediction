hour
has
passed."
As
they
stepped
out
into
the
darkness,
a
sheet
of
rain
was
driven
in
upon
their
faces,
and
the
hall
lamp,
which
dangled
from
the
arm
of
a
marble
Caryatid,
went
out
with
a
fluff.
Pim,
the
butler,
pushed
the
heavy
door
to,
straining
hard
with
his
shoulder
against
the
wind,
while
the
two
men
groped
their
way
towards
the
yellow
glare
which
showed
where
the
cab
was
waiting.
An
instant
later
they
were
rattling
upon
their
journey.
"Is
it
far?"
asked
Douglas
Stone.
"Oh,
no.
We
have
a
very
little
quiet
place
off
the
Euston
Road."
The
surgeon
pressed
the
spring
of
his
repeater
and
listened
to
the
little
tings
which
told
him
the
hour.
It
was
a
quarter
past
nine.
He
calculated
the
distances,
and
the
short
time
which
it
would
take
him
to
perform
so
trivial
an
operation.
He
ought
to
reach
Lady
Sannox
by
ten
o'clock.
Through
the
fogged
windows
he
saw
the
blurred
gas
lamps
dancing
past,
with
occasionally
the
broader
glare
of
a
shop
front.
The
rain
was
pelting
and
rattling
upon
the
leathern
top
of
the
carriage,
and
the
wheels
swashed
as
they
rolled
through
puddle
and
mud.
Opposite
to
him
the
white
headgear
of
his
companion
gleamed
faintly
through
the
obscurity.
The
surgeon
felt
in
his
pockets
and
arranged
his
needles,
his
ligatures
and
his
safety
pins,
that
no
time
might
be
wasted
when
they
arrived.
He
chafed
with
impatience
and
drummed
his
foot
upon
the
floor.
But
the
cab
slowed
down
at
last
and
pulled
up.
In
an
instant
Douglas
Stone
was
out,
and
the
Smyrna
merchant's
toe
was
at
his
very
heel.
"You
can
wait,"
said
he
to
the
driver.
It
was
a
mean
looking
house
in
a
narrow
and
sordid
street.
The
surgeon,
who
knew
his
London
well,
cast
a
swift
glance
into
the
shadows,
but
there
was
nothing
distinctive
no
shop,
no
movement,
nothing
but
a
double
line
of
dull,
flat
faced
houses,
a
double
stretch
of
wet
flagstones
which
gleamed
in
the
lamplight,
and
a
double
rush
of
water
in
the
gutters
which
swirled
and
gurgled
towards
the
sewer
gratings.
The
door
which
faced
them
was
blotched
and
discoloured,
and
a
faint
light
in
the
fan
pane
above,
it
served
to
show
the
dust
and
the
grime
which
covered
it.
Above
in
one
of
the
bedroom
windows,
there
was
a
dull
yellow
glimmer.
The
merchant
knocked
loudly,
and,
as
he
turned
his
dark
face
towards
the
light,
Douglas
Stone
could
see
that
it
was
contracted
with
anxiety.
A
bolt
was
drawn,
and
an
elderly
woman
with
a
taper
stood
in
the
doorway,
shielding
the
thin
flame
with
her
gnarled
hand.
"Is
all
well?"
gasped
the
merchant.
"She
is
as
you
left
her,
sir."
"She
has
not
spoken?"
"No,
she
is
in
a
deep
sleep."
The
merchant
closed
the
door,
and
Douglas
Stone
walked
down
the
narrow
passage,
glancing
about
him
in
some
surprise
as
he
did
so.
There
was
no
oil
cloth,
no
mat,
no
hat
rack.
Deep
grey
dust
and
heavy
festoons
of
cobwebs
met
his
eyes
everywhere.
Following
the
old
woman
up
the
winding
stair,
his
firm
footfall
echoed
harshly
through
the
silent
house.
There
was
no
carpet.
The
bedroom
was
on
the
second
landing.
Douglas
Stone
followed
the
old
nurse
into
it,
with
the
merchant
at
his
heels.
Here,
at
least,
there
was
furniture
and
to
spare.
The
floor
was
littered
and
the
corners
piled
with
Turkish
cabinets,
inlaid
tables,
coats
of
chain
mail,
strange
pipes,
and
grotesque
weapons.
A
single
small
lamp
stood
upon
a
bracket
on
the
wall.
Douglas
Stone
took
it
down,
and
picking
his
way
among
the
lumber,
walked
over
to
a
couch
in
the
corner,
on
which
lay
a
woman
dressed
in
the
Turkish
fashion,
with
yashmak
and
veil.
The
lower
part
of
the
face
was
exposed,
and
the
surgeon
saw
a
jagged
cut
which
zigzagged
along
the
border
of
the
under
lip.
"You
will
forgive
the
yashmak,"
said
the
Turk.
"You
know
our
views
about
women
in
the
East."
But
the
surgeon
was
not
thinking
about
the
yashmak.
This
was
no
longer
a
woman
to
him.
It
was
a
case.
He
stooped
and
examined
the
wound
carefully.
"There
are
no
signs
of
irritation,"
said
he.
"We
might
delay
the
operation
until
local
symptoms
develop."
The
husband
wrung
his
hands
in
uncontrollable
agitation.
"Oh!
sir,
sir,"
he
cried.
"Do
not
trifle.
You
do
not
know.
It
is
deadly.
I
know,
and
I
give
you
my
assurance
that
an
operation
is
absolutely
necessary.
Only
the
knife
can
save
her."
"And
yet
I
am
inclined
to
wait,"
said
Douglas
Stone.
"That
is
enough,"
the
Turk
cried,
angrily.
"Every
minute
is
of
importance,
and
I
cannot
stand
here
and
see
my
wife
allowed
to
sink.
It
only
remains
for
me
to
give
you
my
thanks
for
having
come,
and
to
call
in
some
other
surgeon
before
it
is
too
late."
Douglas
Stone
hesitated.
To
refund
that
hundred
pounds
was
no
pleasant
matter.
But
of
course
if
he
left
the
case
he
must
return
the
money.
And
if
the
Turk
were
right
and
the
woman
died,
his
position
before
a
coroner
might
be
an
embarrassing
one.
"You
have
had
personal
experience
of
this
poison?"
he
asked.
"I
have."
"And
you
assure
me
that
an
operation
is
needful."
"I
swear
it
by
all
that
I
hold
sacred."
"The
disfigurement
will
be
frightful."
"I
can
understand
that
the
mouth
will
not
be
a
pretty
one
to
kiss."
Douglas
Stone
turned
fiercely
upon
the
man.
The
speech
was
a
brutal
one.
But
the
Turk
has
his
own
fashion
of
talk
and
of
thought,
and
there
was
no
time
for
wrangling.
Douglas
Stone
drew
a
bistoury
from
his
case,
opened
it
and
felt
the
keen
straight
edge
with
his
forefinger.
Then
he
held
the
lamp
closer
to
the
bed.
Two
dark
eyes
were
gazing
up
at
him
through
the
slit
in
the
yashmak.
They
were
all
iris,
and
the
pupil
was
hardly
to
be
