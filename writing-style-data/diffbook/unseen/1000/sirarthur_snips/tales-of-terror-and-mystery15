that
of
a
pretty
woman.
There
was
the
piquant
difficulty
of
it
also,
for,
as
she
was
the
companion
of
Lady
Emily
Rood,
it
was
almost
impossible
to
see
her
alone.
On
the
top
of
all
the
other
obstacles
which
attracted
me,
I
learned
from
her
own
lips
very
early
in
the
proceedings
that
she
was
engaged."
"Mein
Gott!
To
whom?"
"She
mentioned
no
names."
"I
do
not
think
that
anyone
knows
that.
So
that
made
the
adventure
more
alluring,
did
it?"
"Well,
it
did
certainly
give
a
spice
to
it.
Don't
you
think
so?"
"I
tell
you
that
I
am
very
ignorant
about
these
things."
"My
dear
fellow,
you
can
remember
that
the
apple
you
stole
from
your
neighbour's
tree
was
always
sweeter
than
that
which
fell
from
your
own.
And
then
I
found
that
she
cared
for
me."
"What
at
once?"
"Oh,
no,
it
took
about
three
months
of
sapping
and
mining.
But
at
last
I
won
her
over.
She
understood
that
my
judicial
separation
from
my
wife
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
do
the
right
thing
by
her
but
she
came
all
the
same,
and
we
had
a
delightful
time,
as
long
as
it
lasted."
"But
how
about
the
other
man?"
Kennedy
shrugged
his
shoulders.
"I
suppose
it
is
the
survival
of
the
fittest,"
said
he.
"If
he
had
been
the
better
man
she
would
not
have
deserted
him.
Let's
drop
the
subject,
for
I
have
had
enough
of
it!"
"Only
one
other
thing.
How
did
you
get
rid
of
her
in
three
weeks?"
"Well,
we
had
both
cooled
down
a
bit,
you
understand.
She
absolutely
refused,
under
any
circumstances,
to
come
back
to
face
the
people
she
had
known
in
Rome.
Now,
of
course,
Rome
is
necessary
to
me,
and
I
was
already
pining
to
be
back
at
my
work
so
there
was
one
obvious
cause
of
separation.
Then,
again,
her
old
father
turned
up
at
the
hotel
in
London,
and
there
was
a
scene,
and
the
whole
thing
became
so
unpleasant
that
really
though
I
missed
her
dreadfully
at
first
I
was
very
glad
to
slip
out
of
it.
Now,
I
rely
upon
you
not
to
repeat
anything
of
what
I
have
said."
"My
dear
Kennedy,
I
should
not
dream
of
repeating
it.
But
all
that
you
say
interests
me
very
much,
for
it
gives
me
an
insight
into
your
way
of
looking
at
things,
which
is
entirely
different
from
mine,
for
I
have
seen
so
little
of
life.
And
now
you
want
to
know
about
my
new
catacomb.
There's
no
use
my
trying
to
describe
it,
for
you
would
never
find
it
by
that.
There
is
only
one
thing,
and
that
is
for
me
to
take
you
there."
"That
would
be
splendid."
"When
would
you
like
to
come?"
"The
sooner
the
better.
I
am
all
impatience
to
see
it."
"Well,
it
is
a
beautiful
night
though
a
trifle
cold.
Suppose
we
start
in
an
hour.
We
must
be
very
careful
to
keep
the
matter
to
ourselves.
If
anyone
saw
us
hunting
in
couples
they
would
suspect
that
there
was
something
going
on."
"We
can't
be
too
cautious,"
said
Kennedy.
"Is
it
far?"
"Some
miles."
"Not
too
far
to
walk?"
"Oh,
no,
we
could
walk
there
easily."
"We
had
better
do
so,
then.
A
cabman's
suspicions
would
be
aroused
if
he
dropped
us
both
at
some
lonely
spot
in
the
dead
of
the
night."
"Quite
so.
I
think
it
would
be
best
for
us
to
meet
at
the
Gate
of
the
Appian
Way
at
midnight.
I
must
go
back
to
my
lodgings
for
the
matches
and
candles
and
things."
"All
right,
Burger!
I
think
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
let
me
into
this
secret,
and
I
promise
you
that
I
will
write
nothing
about
it
until
you
have
published
your
report.
Good
bye
for
the
present!
You
will
find
me
at
the
Gate
at
twelve."
The
cold,
clear
air
was
filled
with
the
musical
chimes
from
that
city
of
clocks
as
Burger,
wrapped
in
an
Italian
overcoat,
with
a
lantern
hanging
from
his
hand,
walked
up
to
the
rendezvous.
Kennedy
stepped
out
of
the
shadow
to
meet
him.
"You
are
ardent
in
work
as
well
as
in
love!"
said
the
German,
laughing.
"Yes;
I
have
been
waiting
here
for
nearly
half
an
hour."
"I
hope
you
left
no
clue
as
to
where
we
were
going."
"Not
such
a
fool!
By
Jove,
I
am
chilled
to
the
bone!
Come
on,
Burger,
let
us
warm
ourselves
by
a
spurt
of
hard
walking."
Their
footsteps
sounded
loud
and
crisp
upon
the
rough
stone
paving
of
the
disappointing
road
which
is
all
that
is
left
of
the
most
famous
highway
of
the
world.
A
peasant
or
two
going
home
from
the
wine
shop,
and
a
few
carts
of
country
produce
coming
up
to
Rome,
were
the
only
things
which
they
met.
They
swung
along,
with
the
huge
tombs
looming
up
through
the
darkness
upon
each
side
of
them,
until
they
had
come
as
far
as
the
Catacombs
of
St.
Calistus,
and
saw
against
a
rising
moon
the
great
circular
bastion
of
Cecilia
Metella
in
front
of
them.
Then
Burger
stopped
with
his
hand
to
his
side.
"Your
legs
are
longer
than
mine,
and
you
are
more
accustomed
to
walking,"
said
he,
laughing.
"I
think
that
the
place
where
we
turn
off
is
somewhere
here.
Yes,
this
is
it,
round
the
corner
of
the
trattoria.
Now,
it
is
a
very
narrow
path,
so
perhaps
I
had
better
go
in
front
and
you
can
follow."
He
had
lit
his
lantern,
and
by
its
light
they
were
enabled
to
follow
a
narrow
and
devious
track
which
wound
across
the
marshes
of
the
Campagna.
The
great
Aqueduct
of
old
Rome
lay
like
a
monstrous
caterpillar
across
the
moonlit
landscape,
and
their
road
led
them
under
one
of
its
huge
arches,
and
past
the
circle
of
crumbling
bricks
which
marks
the
old
arena.
At
last
Burger
stopped
at
a
solitary
wooden
