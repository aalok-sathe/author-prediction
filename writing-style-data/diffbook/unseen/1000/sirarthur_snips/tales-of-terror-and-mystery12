the
other
letters
from
left
to
right
are,
M,
M,
a
small
d,
A,
a
small
d,
and
then
the
final
B."
"Yes,
I
am
sure
that
you
are
right.
I
can
make
out
the
two
small
d's
quite
plainly."
"What
I
have
read
to
you
tonight,"
said
Dacre,
"is
the
official
record
of
the
trial
of
Marie
Madeleine
d'Aubray,
Marquise
de
Brinvilliers,
one
of
the
most
famous
poisoners
and
murderers
of
all
time."
I
sat
in
silence,
overwhelmed
at
the
extraordinary
nature
of
the
incident,
and
at
the
completeness
of
the
proof
with
which
Dacre
had
exposed
its
real
meaning.
In
a
vague
way
I
remembered
some
details
of
the
woman's
career,
her
unbridled
debauchery,
the
cold
blooded
and
protracted
torture
of
her
sick
father,
the
murder
of
her
brothers
for
motives
of
petty
gain.
I
recollected
also
that
the
bravery
of
her
end
had
done
something
to
atone
for
the
horror
of
her
life,
and
that
all
Paris
had
sympathized
with
her
last
moments,
and
blessed
her
as
a
martyr
within
a
few
days
of
the
time
when
they
had
cursed
her
as
a
murderess.
One
objection,
and
one
only,
occurred
to
my
mind.
"How
came
her
initials
and
her
badge
of
rank
upon
the
filler?
Surely
they
did
not
carry
their
mediaeval
homage
to
the
nobility
to
the
point
of
decorating
instruments
of
torture
with
their
titles?"
"I
was
puzzled
with
the
same
point,"
said
Dacre,
"but
it
admits
of
a
simple
explanation.
The
case
excited
extraordinary
interest
at
the
time,
and
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
that
La
Reynie,
the
head
of
the
police,
should
retain
this
filler
as
a
grim
souvenir.
It
was
not
often
that
a
marchioness
of
France
underwent
the
extraordinary
question.
That
he
should
engrave
her
initials
upon
it
for
the
information
of
others
was
surely
a
very
ordinary
proceeding
upon
his
part."
"And
this?"
I
asked,
pointing
to
the
marks
upon
the
leathern
neck.
"She
was
a
cruel
tigress,"
said
Dacre,
as
he
turned
away.
"I
think
it
is
evident
that
like
other
tigresses
her
teeth
were
both
strong
and
sharp."
The
New
Catacomb
"Look
here,
Burger,"
said
Kennedy,
"I
do
wish
that
you
would
confide
in
me."
The
two
famous
students
of
Roman
remains
sat
together
in
Kennedy's
comfortable
room
overlooking
the
Corso.
The
night
was
cold,
and
they
had
both
pulled
up
their
chairs
to
the
unsatisfactory
Italian
stove
which
threw
out
a
zone
of
stuffiness
rather
than
of
warmth.
Outside
under
the
bright
winter
stars
lay
the
modern
Rome,
the
long,
double
chain
of
the
electric
lamps,
the
brilliantly
lighted
cafes,
the
rushing
carriages,
and
the
dense
throng
upon
the
footpaths.
But
inside,
in
the
sumptuous
chamber
of
the
rich
young
English
archaeologist,
there
was
only
old
Rome
to
be
seen.
Cracked
and
timeworn
friezes
hung
upon
the
walls,
grey
old
busts
of
senators
and
soldiers
with
their
fighting
heads
and
their
hard,
cruel
faces
peered
out
from
the
corners.
On
the
centre
table,
amidst
a
litter
of
inscriptions,
fragments,
and
ornaments,
there
stood
the
famous
reconstruction
by
Kennedy
of
the
Baths
of
Caracalla,
which
excited
such
interest
and
admiration
when
it
was
exhibited
in
Berlin.
Amphorae
hung
from
the
ceiling,
and
a
litter
of
curiosities
strewed
the
rich
red
Turkey
carpet.
And
of
them
all
there
was
not
one
which
was
not
of
the
most
unimpeachable
authenticity,
and
of
the
utmost
rarity
and
value;
for
Kennedy,
though
little
more
than
thirty,
had
a
European
reputation
in
this
particular
branch
of
research,
and
was,
moreover,
provided
with
that
long
purse
which
either
proves
to
be
a
fatal
handicap
to
the
student's
energies,
or,
if
his
mind
is
still
true
to
its
purpose,
gives
him
an
enormous
advantage
in
the
race
for
fame.
Kennedy
had
often
been
seduced
by
whim
and
pleasure
from
his
studies,
but
his
mind
was
an
incisive
one,
capable
of
long
and
concentrated
efforts
which
ended
in
sharp
reactions
of
sensuous
languor.
His
handsome
face,
with
its
high,
white
forehead,
its
aggressive
nose,
and
its
somewhat
loose
and
sensual
mouth,
was
a
fair
index
of
the
compromise
between
strength
and
weakness
in
his
nature.
Of
a
very
different
type
was
his
companion,
Julius
Burger.
He
came
of
a
curious
blend,
a
German
father
and
an
Italian
mother,
with
the
robust
qualities
of
the
North
mingling
strangely
with
the
softer
graces
of
the
South.
Blue
Teutonic
eyes
lightened
his
sun
browned
face,
and
above
them
rose
a
square,
massive
forehead,
with
a
fringe
of
close
yellow
curls
lying
round
it.
His
strong,
firm
jaw
was
clean
shaven,
and
his
companion
had
frequently
remarked
how
much
it
suggested
those
old
Roman
busts
which
peered
out
from
the
shadows
in
the
corners
of
his
chamber.
Under
its
bluff
German
strength
there
lay
always
a
suggestion
of
Italian
subtlety,
but
the
smile
was
so
honest,
and
the
eyes
so
frank,
that
one
understood
that
this
was
only
an
indication
of
his
ancestry,
with
no
actual
bearing
upon
his
character.
In
age
and
in
reputation,
he
was
on
the
same
level
as
his
English
companion,
but
his
life
and
his
work
had
both
been
far
more
arduous.
Twelve
years
before,
he
had
come
as
a
poor
student
to
Rome,
and
had
lived
ever
since
upon
some
small
endowment
for
research
which
had
been
awarded
to
him
by
the
University
of
Bonn.
Painfully,
slowly,
and
doggedly,
with
extraordinary
tenacity
and
single
mindedness,
he
had
climbed
from
rung
to
rung
of
the
ladder
of
fame,
until
now
he
was
a
member
of
the
Berlin
Academy,
and
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
shortly
be
promoted
to
the
Chair
of
the
greatest
of
German
Universities.
But
the
singleness
of
purpose
which
had
brought
him
to
the
same
high
level
as
the
rich
and
brilliant
Englishman,
had
caused
him
in
everything
outside
their
work
to
stand
infinitely
below
him.
He
had
never
found
a
pause
in
his
studies
in
which
to
cultivate
the
social
graces.
It
was
only
when
he
