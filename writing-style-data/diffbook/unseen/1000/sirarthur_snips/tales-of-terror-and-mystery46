thicker
and
heavier
the
better."
You
may
imagine
that
I
had
plenty
to
think
of
from
the
time
that
I
left
Brook
Street
until
I
set
out
to
meet
Lord
Linchmere
at
Paddington.
The
whole
fantastic
business
kept
arranging
and
rearranging
itself
in
kaleidoscopic
forms
inside
my
brain,
until
I
had
thought
out
a
dozen
explanations,
each
of
them
more
grotesquely
improbable
than
the
last.
And
yet
I
felt
that
the
truth
must
be
something
grotesquely
improbable
also.
At
last
I
gave
up
all
attempts
at
finding
a
solution,
and
contented
myself
with
exactly
carrying
out
the
instructions
which
I
had
received.
With
a
hand
valise,
specimen
case,
and
a
loaded
cane,
I
was
waiting
at
the
Paddington
bookstall
when
Lord
Linchmere
arrived.
He
was
an
even
smaller
man
than
I
had
thought
frail
and
peaky,
with
a
manner
which
was
more
nervous
than
it
had
been
in
the
morning.
He
wore
a
long,
thick
travelling
ulster,
and
I
observed
that
he
carried
a
heavy
blackthorn
cudgel
in
his
hand.
"I
have
the
tickets,"
said
he,
leading
the
way
up
the
platform.
"This
is
our
train.
I
have
engaged
a
carriage,
for
I
am
particularly
anxious
to
impress
one
or
two
things
upon
you
while
we
travel
down."
And
yet
all
that
he
had
to
impress
upon
me
might
have
been
said
in
a
sentence,
for
it
was
that
I
was
to
remember
that
I
was
there
as
a
protection
to
himself,
and
that
I
was
not
on
any
consideration
to
leave
him
for
an
instant.
This
he
repeated
again
and
again
as
our
journey
drew
to
a
close,
with
an
insistence
which
showed
that
his
nerves
were
thoroughly
shaken.
"Yes,"
he
said
at
last,
in
answer
to
my
looks
rather
than
to
my
words,
"I
AM
nervous,
Dr.
Hamilton.
I
have
always
been
a
timid
man,
and
my
timidity
depends
upon
my
frail
physical
health.
But
my
soul
is
firm,
and
I
can
bring
myself
up
to
face
a
danger
which
a
less
nervous
man
might
shrink
from.
What
I
am
doing
now
is
done
from
no
compulsion,
but
entirely
from
a
sense
of
duty,
and
yet
it
is,
beyond
doubt,
a
desperate
risk.
If
things
should
go
wrong,
I
will
have
some
claims
to
the
title
of
martyr."
This
eternal
reading
of
riddles
was
too
much
for
me.
I
felt
that
I
must
put
a
term
to
it.
"I
think
it
would
very
much
better,
sir,
if
you
were
to
trust
me
entirely,"
said
I.
"It
is
impossible
for
me
to
act
effectively,
when
I
do
not
know
what
are
the
objects
which
we
have
in
view,
or
even
where
we
are
going."
"Oh,
as
to
where
we
are
going,
there
need
be
no
mystery
about
that,"
said
he;
"we
are
going
to
Delamere
Court,
the
residence
of
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter,
with
whose
work
you
are
so
conversant.
As
to
the
exact
object
of
our
visit,
I
do
not
know
that
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
anything
would
be
gained,
Dr.
Hamilton,
by
taking
you
into
my
complete
confidence.
I
may
tell
you
that
we
are
acting
I
say
'we,'
because
my
sister,
Lady
Rossiter,
takes
the
same
view
as
myself
with
the
one
object
of
preventing
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
family
scandal.
That
being
so,
you
can
understand
that
I
am
loath
to
give
any
explanations
which
are
not
absolutely
necessary.
It
would
be
a
different
matter,
Dr.
Hamilton,
if
I
were
asking
your
advice.
As
matters
stand,
it
is
only
your
active
help
which
I
need,
and
I
will
indicate
to
you
from
time
to
time
how
you
can
best
give
it."
There
was
nothing
more
to
be
said,
and
a
poor
man
can
put
up
with
a
good
deal
for
twenty
pounds
a
day,
but
I
felt
none
the
less
that
Lord
Linchmere
was
acting
rather
scurvily
towards
me.
He
wished
to
convert
me
into
a
passive
tool,
like
the
blackthorn
in
his
hand.
With
his
sensitive
disposition
I
could
imagine,
however,
that
scandal
would
be
abhorrent
to
him,
and
I
realized
that
he
would
not
take
me
into
his
confidence
until
no
other
course
was
open
to
him.
I
must
trust
to
my
own
eyes
and
ears
to
solve
the
mystery,
but
I
had
every
confidence
that
I
should
not
trust
to
them
in
vain.
Delamere
Court
lies
a
good
five
miles
from
Pangbourne
Station,
and
we
drove
for
that
distance
in
an
open
fly.
Lord
Linchmere
sat
in
deep
thought
during
the
time,
and
he
never
opened
his
mouth
until
we
were
close
to
our
destination.
When
he
did
speak
it
was
to
give
me
a
piece
of
information
which
surprised
me.
"Perhaps
you
are
not
aware,"
said
he,
"that
I
am
a
medical
man
like
yourself?"
"No,
sir,
I
did
not
know
it."
"Yes,
I
qualified
in
my
younger
days,
when
there
were
several
lives
between
me
and
the
peerage.
I
have
not
had
occasion
to
practise,
but
I
have
found
it
a
useful
education,
all
the
same.
I
never
regretted
the
years
which
I
devoted
to
medical
study.
These
are
the
gates
of
Delamere
Court."
We
had
come
to
two
high
pillars
crowned
with
heraldic
monsters
which
flanked
the
opening
of
a
winding
avenue.
Over
the
laurel
bushes
and
rhododendrons,
I
could
see
a
long,
many
gabled
mansion,
girdled
with
ivy,
and
toned
to
the
warm,
cheery,
mellow
glow
of
old
brick
work.
My
eyes
were
still
fixed
in
admiration
upon
this
delightful
house
when
my
companion
plucked
nervously
at
my
sleeve.
"Here's
Sir
Thomas,"
he
whispered.
"Please
talk
beetle
all
you
can."
A
tall,
thin
figure,
curiously
angular
and
bony,
had
emerged
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
of
laurels.
In
his
hand
he
held
a
spud,
and
he
wore
gauntleted
gardener's
gloves.
A
broad
brimmed,
grey
hat
cast
his
face
into
shadow,
but
it
struck
me
as
exceedingly
austere,
with
an
ill
nourished
beard
and
harsh,
irregular
features.
The
fly
pulled
up
and
Lord
Linchmere
sprang
