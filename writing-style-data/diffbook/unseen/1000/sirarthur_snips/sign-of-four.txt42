I,
'they
are
in
with
me,
and
we
all
go
together.'
"Well,
the
matter
ended
by
a
second
meeting,
at
which
Mahomet
Singh,
Abdullah
Khan,
and
Dost
Akbar
were
all
present.
We
talked
the
matter
over
again,
and
at
last
we
came
to
an
arrangement.
We
were
to
provide
both
the
officers
with
charts
of
the
part
of
the
Agra
fort
and
mark
the
place
in
the
wall
where
the
treasure
was
hid.
Major
Sholto
was
to
go
to
India
to
test
our
story.
If
he
found
the
box
he
was
to
leave
it
there,
to
send
out
a
small
yacht
provisioned
for
a
voyage,
which
was
to
lie
off
Rutland
Island,
and
to
which
we
were
to
make
our
way,
and
finally
to
return
to
his
duties.
Captain
Morstan
was
then
to
apply
for
leave
of
absence,
to
meet
us
at
Agra,
and
there
we
were
to
have
a
final
division
of
the
treasure,
he
taking
the
major's
share
as
well
as
his
own.
All
this
we
sealed
by
the
most
solemn
oaths
that
the
mind
could
think
or
the
lips
utter.
I
sat
up
all
night
with
paper
and
ink,
and
by
the
morning
I
had
the
two
charts
all
ready,
signed
with
the
sign
of
four,
that
is,
of
Abdullah,
Akbar,
Mahomet,
and
myself.
"Well,
gentlemen,
I
weary
you
with
my
long
story,
and
I
know
that
my
friend
Mr.
Jones
is
impatient
to
get
me
safely
stowed
in
chokey.
I'll
make
it
as
short
as
I
can.
The
villain
Sholto
went
off
to
India,
but
he
never
came
back
again.
Captain
Morstan
showed
me
his
name
among
a
list
of
passengers
in
one
of
the
mail
boats
very
shortly
afterwards.
His
uncle
had
died,
leaving
him
a
fortune,
and
he
had
left
the
army,
yet
he
could
stoop
to
treat
five
men
as
he
had
treated
us.
Morstan
went
over
to
Agra
shortly
afterwards,
and
found,
as
we
expected,
that
the
treasure
was
indeed
gone.
The
scoundrel
had
stolen
it
all,
without
carrying
out
one
of
the
conditions
on
which
we
had
sold
him
the
secret.
From
that
day
I
lived
only
for
vengeance.
I
thought
of
it
by
day
and
I
nursed
it
by
night.
It
became
an
overpowering,
absorbing
passion
with
me.
I
cared
nothing
for
the
law,
nothing
for
the
gallows.
To
escape,
to
track
down
Sholto,
to
have
my
hand
upon
his
throat,
that
was
my
one
thought.
Even
the
Agra
treasure
had
come
to
be
a
smaller
thing
in
my
mind
than
the
slaying
of
Sholto.
"Well,
I
have
set
my
mind
on
many
things
in
this
life,
and
never
one
which
I
did
not
carry
out.
But
it
was
weary
years
before
my
time
came.
I
have
told
you
that
I
had
picked
up
something
of
medicine.
One
day
when
Dr.
Somerton
was
down
with
a
fever
a
little
Andaman
Islander
was
picked
up
by
a
convict
gang
in
the
woods.
He
was
sick
to
death,
and
had
gone
to
a
lonely
place
to
die.
I
took
him
in
hand,
though
he
was
as
venomous
as
a
young
snake,
and
after
a
couple
of
months
I
got
him
all
right
and
able
to
walk.
He
took
a
kind
of
fancy
to
me
then,
and
would
hardly
go
back
to
his
woods,
but
was
always
hanging
about
my
hut.
I
learned
a
little
of
his
lingo
from
him,
and
this
made
him
all
the
fonder
of
me.
"Tonga
for
that
was
his
name
was
a
fine
boatman,
and
owned
a
big,
roomy
canoe
of
his
own.
When
I
found
that
he
was
devoted
to
me
and
would
do
anything
to
serve
me,
I
saw
my
chance
of
escape.
I
talked
it
over
with
him.
He
was
to
bring
his
boat
round
on
a
certain
night
to
an
old
wharf
which
was
never
guarded,
and
there
he
was
to
pick
me
up.
I
gave
him
directions
to
have
several
gourds
of
water
and
a
lot
of
yams,
cocoa
nuts,
and
sweet
potatoes.
"He
was
stanch
and
true,
was
little
Tonga.
No
man
ever
had
a
more
faithful
mate.
At
the
night
named
he
had
his
boat
at
the
wharf.
As
it
chanced,
however,
there
was
one
of
the
convict
guard
down
there,
a
vile
Pathan
who
had
never
missed
a
chance
of
insulting
and
injuring
me.
I
had
always
vowed
vengeance,
and
now
I
had
my
chance.
It
was
as
if
fate
had
placed
him
in
my
way
that
I
might
pay
my
debt
before
I
left
the
island.
He
stood
on
the
bank
with
his
back
to
me,
and
his
carbine
on
his
shoulder.
I
looked
about
for
a
stone
to
beat
out
his
brains
with,
but
none
could
I
see.
Then
a
queer
thought
came
into
my
head
and
showed
me
where
I
could
lay
my
hand
on
a
weapon.
I
sat
down
in
the
darkness
and
unstrapped
my
wooden
leg.
With
three
long
hops
I
was
on
him.
He
put
his
carbine
to
his
shoulder,
but
I
struck
him
full,
and
knocked
the
whole
front
of
his
skull
in.
You
can
see
the
split
in
the
wood
now
where
I
hit
him.
We
both
went
down
together,
for
I
could
not
keep
my
balance,
but
when
I
got
up
I
found
him
still
lying
quiet
enough.
I
made
for
the
boat,
and
in
an
hour
we
were
well
out
at
sea.
Tonga
had
brought
all
his
earthly
possessions
with
him,
his
arms
and
his
gods.
Among
other
things,
he
had
a
long
bamboo
spear,
and
some
Andaman
cocoa
nut
matting,
with
which
I
made
a
sort
of
sail.
For
ten
days
we
were
beating
about,
trusting
to
luck,
and
on
the
eleventh
we
were
picked
up
by
a
trader
which
was
going
from
Singapore
to
Jiddah
with
a
cargo
of
Malay
pilgrims.
They
were
a
rum
crowd,
and
Tonga
and
I
soon
managed
to
settle
down
among
them.
They
had
one
very
good
quality:
they
let
you
alone
and
