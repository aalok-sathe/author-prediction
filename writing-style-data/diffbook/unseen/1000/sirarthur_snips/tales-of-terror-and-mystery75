his
actual
engagement
to
Elise,
there
was
hardly
an
evening
which
he
did
not
pass
with
us,
and
an
hour
or
two
were
generally
devoted
to
the
museum.
He
had
the
free
run
of
the
place,
and
when
I
have
been
away
for
the
evening
I
had
no
objection
to
his
doing
whatever
he
wished
here.
This
state
of
things
was
only
terminated
by
the
fact
of
my
resignation
of
my
official
duties
and
my
retirement
to
Norwood,
where
I
hoped
to
have
the
leisure
to
write
a
considerable
work
which
I
had
planned.
"It
was
immediately
after
this
within
a
week
or
so
that
I
first
realized
the
true
nature
and
character
of
the
man
whom
I
had
so
imprudently
introduced
into
my
family.
The
discovery
came
to
me
through
letters
from
my
friends
abroad,
which
showed
me
that
his
introductions
to
me
had
been
forgeries.
Aghast
at
the
revelation,
I
asked
myself
what
motive
this
man
could
originally
have
had
in
practising
this
elaborate
deception
upon
me.
I
was
too
poor
a
man
for
any
fortune
hunter
to
have
marked
me
down.
Why,
then,
had
he
come?
I
remembered
that
some
of
the
most
precious
gems
in
Europe
had
been
under
my
charge,
and
I
remembered
also
the
ingenious
excuses
by
which
this
man
had
made
himself
familiar
with
the
cases
in
which
they
were
kept.
He
was
a
rascal
who
was
planning
some
gigantic
robbery.
How
could
I,
without
striking
my
own
daughter,
who
was
infatuated
about
him,
prevent
him
from
carrying
out
any
plan
which
he
might
have
formed?
My
device
was
a
clumsy
one,
and
yet
I
could
think
of
nothing
more
effective.
If
I
had
written
a
letter
under
my
own
name,
you
would
naturally
have
turned
to
me
for
details
which
I
did
not
wish
to
give.
I
resorted
to
an
anonymous
letter,
begging
you
to
be
upon
your
guard.
"I
may
tell
you
that
my
change
from
Belmore
Street
to
Norwood
had
not
affected
the
visits
of
this
man,
who
had,
I
believe,
a
real
and
overpowering
affection
for
my
daughter.
As
to
her,
I
could
not
have
believed
that
any
woman
could
be
so
completely
under
the
influence
of
a
man
as
she
was.
His
stronger
nature
seemed
to
entirely
dominate
her.
I
had
not
realized
how
far
this
was
the
case,
or
the
extent
of
the
confidence
which
existed
between
them,
until
that
very
evening
when
his
true
character
for
the
first
time
was
made
clear
to
me.
I
had
given
orders
that
when
he
called
he
should
be
shown
into
my
study
instead
of
to
the
drawing
room.
There
I
told
him
bluntly
that
I
knew
all
about
him,
that
I
had
taken
steps
to
defeat
his
designs,
and
that
neither
I
nor
my
daughter
desired
ever
to
see
him
again.
I
added
that
I
thanked
God
that
I
had
found
him
out
before
he
had
time
to
harm
those
precious
objects
which
it
had
been
the
work
of
my
life
time
to
protect.
"He
was
certainly
a
man
of
iron
nerve.
He
took
my
remarks
without
a
sign
either
of
surprise
or
of
defiance,
but
listened
gravely
and
attentively
until
I
had
finished.
Then
he
walked
across
the
room
without
a
word
and
struck
the
bell.
"'Ask
Miss
Andreas
to
be
so
kind
as
to
step
this
way,'
said
he
to
the
servant.
"My
daughter
entered,
and
the
man
closed
the
door
behind
her.
Then
he
took
her
hand
in
his.
"'Elise,'
said
he,
'your
father
has
just
discovered
that
I
am
a
villain.
He
knows
now
what
you
knew
before.'
"She
stood
in
silence,
listening.
"'He
says
that
we
are
to
part
for
ever,'
said
he.
"She
did
not
withdraw
her
hand.
"'Will
you
be
true
to
me,
or
will
you
remove
the
last
good
influence
which
is
ever
likely
to
come
into
my
life?'
"'John,'
she
cried,
passionately.
'I
will
never
abandon
you!
Never,
never,
not
if
the
whole
world
were
against
you.'
"In
vain
I
argued
and
pleaded
with
her.
It
was
absolutely
useless.
Her
whole
life
was
bound
up
in
this
man
before
me.
My
daughter,
gentlemen,
is
all
that
I
have
left
to
love,
and
it
filled
me
with
agony
when
I
saw
how
powerless
I
was
to
save
her
from
her
ruin.
My
helplessness
seemed
to
touch
this
man
who
was
the
cause
of
my
trouble.
"'It
may
not
be
as
bad
as
you
think,
sir,'
said
he,
in
his
quiet,
inflexible
way.
'I
love
Elise
with
a
love
which
is
strong
enough
to
rescue
even
one
who
has
such
a
record
as
I
have.
It
was
but
yesterday
that
I
promised
her
that
never
again
in
my
whole
life
would
I
do
a
thing
of
which
she
should
be
ashamed.
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
it,
and
never
yet
did
I
make
up
my
mind
to
a
thing
which
I
did
not
do.'
"He
spoke
with
an
air
which
carried
conviction
with
it.
As
he
concluded
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
he
drew
out
a
small
cardboard
box.
"'I
am
about
to
give
you
a
proof
of
my
determination,'
said
he.
'This,
Elise,
shall
be
the
first
fruits
of
your
redeeming
influence
over
me.
You
are
right,
sir,
in
thinking
that
I
had
designs
upon
the
jewels
in
your
possession.
Such
ventures
have
had
a
charm
for
me,
which
depended
as
much
upon
the
risk
run
as
upon
the
value
of
the
prize.
Those
famous
and
antique
stones
of
the
Jewish
priest
were
a
challenge
to
my
daring
and
my
ingenuity.
I
determined
to
get
them.'
"'I
guessed
as
much.'
"'There
was
only
one
thing
that
you
did
not
guess.'
"'And
what
is
that?'
"'That
I
got
them.
They
are
in
this
box.'
"He
opened
the
box,
and
tilted
out
the
contents
upon
the
corner
of
my
desk.
My
hair
rose
and
my
flesh
grew
cold
as
I
looked.
There
were
twelve
magnificent
square
stones
engraved
