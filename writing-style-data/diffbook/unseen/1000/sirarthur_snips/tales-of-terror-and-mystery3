real
work
is
to
be
done.
Beaumont
found
that
out
in
very
early
days.
For
one
thing
it
doesn't
mind
damp,
and
the
weather
looks
as
if
we
should
be
in
the
clouds
all
the
time.
It's
a
bonny
little
model
and
answers
my
hand
like
a
tender
mouthed
horse.
The
engine
is
a
ten
cylinder
rotary
Robur
working
up
to
one
hundred
and
seventy
five.
It
has
all
the
modern
improvements
enclosed
fuselage,
high
curved
landing
skids,
brakes,
gyroscopic
steadiers,
and
three
speeds,
worked
by
an
alteration
of
the
angle
of
the
planes
upon
the
Venetian
blind
principle.
I
took
a
shot
gun
with
me
and
a
dozen
cartridges
filled
with
buck
shot.
You
should
have
seen
the
face
of
Perkins,
my
old
mechanic,
when
I
directed
him
to
put
them
in.
I
was
dressed
like
an
Arctic
explorer,
with
two
jerseys
under
my
overalls,
thick
socks
inside
my
padded
boots,
a
storm
cap
with
flaps,
and
my
talc
goggles.
It
was
stifling
outside
the
hangars,
but
I
was
going
for
the
summit
of
the
Himalayas,
and
had
to
dress
for
the
part.
Perkins
knew
there
was
something
on
and
implored
me
to
take
him
with
me.
Perhaps
I
should
if
I
were
using
the
biplane,
but
a
monoplane
is
a
one
man
show
if
you
want
to
get
the
last
foot
of
life
out
of
it.
Of
course,
I
took
an
oxygen
bag;
the
man
who
goes
for
the
altitude
record
without
one
will
either
be
frozen
or
smothered
or
both.
"I
had
a
good
look
at
the
planes,
the
rudder
bar,
and
the
elevating
lever
before
I
got
in.
Everything
was
in
order
so
far
as
I
could
see.
Then
I
switched
on
my
engine
and
found
that
she
was
running
sweetly.
When
they
let
her
go
she
rose
almost
at
once
upon
the
lowest
speed.
I
circled
my
home
field
once
or
twice
just
to
warm
her
up,
and
then
with
a
wave
to
Perkins
and
the
others,
I
flattened
out
my
planes
and
put
her
on
her
highest.
She
skimmed
like
a
swallow
down
wind
for
eight
or
ten
miles
until
I
turned
her
nose
up
a
little
and
she
began
to
climb
in
a
great
spiral
for
the
cloud
bank
above
me.
It's
all
important
to
rise
slowly
and
adapt
yourself
to
the
pressure
as
you
go.
"It
was
a
close,
warm
day
for
an
English
September,
and
there
was
the
hush
and
heaviness
of
impending
rain.
Now
and
then
there
came
sudden
puffs
of
wind
from
the
south
west
one
of
them
so
gusty
and
unexpected
that
it
caught
me
napping
and
turned
me
half
round
for
an
instant.
I
remember
the
time
when
gusts
and
whirls
and
air
pockets
used
to
be
things
of
danger
before
we
learned
to
put
an
overmastering
power
into
our
engines.
Just
as
I
reached
the
cloud
banks,
with
the
altimeter
marking
three
thousand,
down
came
the
rain.
My
word,
how
it
poured!
It
drummed
upon
my
wings
and
lashed
against
my
face,
blurring
my
glasses
so
that
I
could
hardly
see.
I
got
down
on
to
a
low
speed,
for
it
was
painful
to
travel
against
it.
As
I
got
higher
it
became
hail,
and
I
had
to
turn
tail
to
it.
One
of
my
cylinders
was
out
of
action
a
dirty
plug,
I
should
imagine,
but
still
I
was
rising
steadily
with
plenty
of
power.
After
a
bit
the
trouble
passed,
whatever
it
was,
and
I
heard
the
full,
deep
throated
purr
the
ten
singing
as
one.
That's
where
the
beauty
of
our
modern
silencers
comes
in.
We
can
at
last
control
our
engines
by
ear.
How
they
squeal
and
squeak
and
sob
when
they
are
in
trouble!
All
those
cries
for
help
were
wasted
in
the
old
days,
when
every
sound
was
swallowed
up
by
the
monstrous
racket
of
the
machine.
If
only
the
early
aviators
could
come
back
to
see
the
beauty
and
perfection
of
the
mechanism
which
have
been
bought
at
the
cost
of
their
lives!
"About
nine
thirty
I
was
nearing
the
clouds.
Down
below
me,
all
blurred
and
shadowed
with
rain,
lay
the
vast
expanse
of
Salisbury
Plain.
Half
a
dozen
flying
machines
were
doing
hackwork
at
the
thousand
foot
level,
looking
like
little
black
swallows
against
the
green
background.
I
dare
say
they
were
wondering
what
I
was
doing
up
in
cloud
land.
Suddenly
a
grey
curtain
drew
across
beneath
me
and
the
wet
folds
of
vapours
were
swirling
round
my
face.
It
was
clammily
cold
and
miserable.
But
I
was
above
the
hail
storm,
and
that
was
something
gained.
The
cloud
was
as
dark
and
thick
as
a
London
fog.
In
my
anxiety
to
get
clear,
I
cocked
her
nose
up
until
the
automatic
alarm
bell
rang,
and
I
actually
began
to
slide
backwards.
My
sopped
and
dripping
wings
had
made
me
heavier
than
I
thought,
but
presently
I
was
in
lighter
cloud,
and
soon
had
cleared
the
first
layer.
There
was
a
second
opal
coloured
and
fleecy
at
a
great
height
above
my
head,
a
white,
unbroken
ceiling
above,
and
a
dark,
unbroken
floor
below,
with
the
monoplane
labouring
upwards
upon
a
vast
spiral
between
them.
It
is
deadly
lonely
in
these
cloud
spaces.
Once
a
great
flight
of
some
small
water
birds
went
past
me,
flying
very
fast
to
the
westwards.
The
quick
whir
of
their
wings
and
their
musical
cry
were
cheery
to
my
ear.
I
fancy
that
they
were
teal,
but
I
am
a
wretched
zoologist.
Now
that
we
humans
have
become
birds
we
must
really
learn
to
know
our
brethren
by
sight.
"The
wind
down
beneath
me
whirled
and
swayed
the
broad
cloud
plain.
Once
a
great
eddy
formed
in
it,
a
whirlpool
of
vapour,
and
through
it,
as
down
a
funnel,
I
caught
sight
of
the
distant
world.
A
large
white
biplane
was
passing
at
a
vast
depth
beneath
me.
I
fancy
it
was
the
morning
mail
service
betwixt
Bristol
and
London.
