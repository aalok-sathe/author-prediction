the
ladder
of
success,
for
Lady
Rossiter
and
Lord
Linchmere
have
proved
to
be
staunch
friends,
and
they
have
never
forgotten
my
association
with
them
in
the
time
of
their
need.
Sir
Thomas
is
out
and
said
to
be
cured,
but
I
still
think
that
if
I
spent
another
night
at
Delamere
Court,
I
should
be
inclined
to
lock
my
door
upon
the
inside.
The
Man
with
the
Watches
There
are
many
who
will
still
bear
in
mind
the
singular
circumstances
which,
under
the
heading
of
the
Rugby
Mystery,
filled
many
columns
of
the
daily
Press
in
the
spring
of
the
year
1892.
Coming
as
it
did
at
a
period
of
exceptional
dullness,
it
attracted
perhaps
rather
more
attention
than
it
deserved,
but
it
offered
to
the
public
that
mixture
of
the
whimsical
and
the
tragic
which
is
most
stimulating
to
the
popular
imagination.
Interest
drooped,
however,
when,
after
weeks
of
fruitless
investigation,
it
was
found
that
no
final
explanation
of
the
facts
was
forthcoming,
and
the
tragedy
seemed
from
that
time
to
the
present
to
have
finally
taken
its
place
in
the
dark
catalogue
of
inexplicable
and
unexpiated
crimes.
A
recent
communication
(the
authenticity
of
which
appears
to
be
above
question)
has,
however,
thrown
some
new
and
clear
light
upon
the
matter.
Before
laying
it
before
the
public
it
would
be
as
well,
perhaps,
that
I
should
refresh
their
memories
as
to
the
singular
facts
upon
which
this
commentary
is
founded.
These
facts
were
briefly
as
follows:
At
five
o'clock
on
the
evening
of
the
18th
of
March
in
the
year
already
mentioned
a
train
left
Euston
Station
for
Manchester.
It
was
a
rainy,
squally
day,
which
grew
wilder
as
it
progressed,
so
it
was
by
no
means
the
weather
in
which
anyone
would
travel
who
was
not
driven
to
do
so
by
necessity.
The
train,
however,
is
a
favourite
one
among
Manchester
business
men
who
are
returning
from
town,
for
it
does
the
journey
in
four
hours
and
twenty
minutes,
with
only
three
stoppages
upon
the
way.
In
spite
of
the
inclement
evening
it
was,
therefore,
fairly
well
filled
upon
the
occasion
of
which
I
speak.
The
guard
of
the
train
was
a
tried
servant
of
the
company
a
man
who
had
worked
for
twenty
two
years
without
a
blemish
or
complaint.
His
name
was
John
Palmer.
The
station
clock
was
upon
the
stroke
of
five,
and
the
guard
was
about
to
give
the
customary
signal
to
the
engine
driver
when
he
observed
two
belated
passengers
hurrying
down
the
platform.
The
one
was
an
exceptionally
tall
man,
dressed
in
a
long
black
overcoat
with
astrakhan
collar
and
cuffs.
I
have
already
said
that
the
evening
was
an
inclement
one,
and
the
tall
traveller
had
the
high,
warm
collar
turned
up
to
protect
his
throat
against
the
bitter
March
wind.
He
appeared,
as
far
as
the
guard
could
judge
by
so
hurried
an
inspection,
to
be
a
man
between
fifty
and
sixty
years
of
age,
who
had
retained
a
good
deal
of
the
vigour
and
activity
of
his
youth.
In
one
hand
he
carried
a
brown
leather
Gladstone
bag.
His
companion
was
a
lady,
tall
and
erect,
walking
with
a
vigorous
step
which
outpaced
the
gentleman
beside
her.
She
wore
a
long,
fawn
coloured
dust
cloak,
a
black,
close
fitting
toque,
and
a
dark
veil
which
concealed
the
greater
part
of
her
face.
The
two
might
very
well
have
passed
as
father
and
daughter.
They
walked
swiftly
down
the
line
of
carriages,
glancing
in
at
the
windows,
until
the
guard,
John
Palmer,
overtook
them.
"Now
then,
sir,
look
sharp,
the
train
is
going,"
said
he.
"First
class,"
the
man
answered.
The
guard
turned
the
handle
of
the
nearest
door.
In
the
carriage
which
he
had
opened,
there
sat
a
small
man
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth.
His
appearance
seems
to
have
impressed
itself
upon
the
guard's
memory,
for
he
was
prepared,
afterwards,
to
describe
or
to
identify
him.
He
was
a
man
of
thirty
four
or
thirty
five
years
of
age,
dressed
in
some
grey
material,
sharp
nosed,
alert,
with
a
ruddy,
weather
beaten
face,
and
a
small,
closely
cropped,
black
beard.
He
glanced
up
as
the
door
was
opened.
The
tall
man
paused
with
his
foot
upon
the
step.
"This
is
a
smoking
compartment.
The
lady
dislikes
smoke,"
said
he,
looking
round
at
the
guard.
"All
right!
Here
you
are,
sir!"
said
John
Palmer.
He
slammed
the
door
of
the
smoking
carriage,
opened
that
of
the
next
one,
which
was
empty,
and
thrust
the
two
travellers
in.
At
the
same
moment
he
sounded
his
whistle
and
the
wheels
of
the
train
began
to
move.
The
man
with
the
cigar
was
at
the
window
of
his
carriage,
and
said
something
to
the
guard
as
he
rolled
past
him,
but
the
words
were
lost
in
the
bustle
of
the
departure.
Palmer
stepped
into
the
guard's
van,
as
it
came
up
to
him,
and
thought
no
more
of
the
incident.
Twelve
minutes
after
its
departure
the
train
reached
Willesden
Junction,
where
it
stopped
for
a
very
short
interval.
An
examination
of
the
tickets
has
made
it
certain
that
no
one
either
joined
or
left
it
at
this
time,
and
no
passenger
was
seen
to
alight
upon
the
platform.
At
5:14
the
journey
to
Manchester
was
resumed,
and
Rugby
was
reached
at
6:50,
the
express
being
five
minutes
late.
At
Rugby
the
attention
of
the
station
officials
was
drawn
to
the
fact
that
the
door
of
one
of
the
first
class
carriages
was
open.
An
examination
of
that
compartment,
and
of
its
neighbour,
disclosed
a
remarkable
state
of
affairs.
The
smoking
carriage
in
which
the
short,
red
faced
man
with
the
black
beard
had
been
seen
was
now
empty.
Save
for
a
half
smoked
cigar,
there
was
no
trace
whatever
of
its
recent
occupant.
The
door
of
this
carriage
was
fastened.
In
the
next
compartment,
to
which
attention
had
been
originally
drawn,
there
was
no
sign
either
of
the
gentleman
with
