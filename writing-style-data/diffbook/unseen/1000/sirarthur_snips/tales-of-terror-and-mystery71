for
writing
an
anonymous
warning
letter
to
his
successor
for
that
the
writing
was
his
was
as
certain
to
me
as
if
I
had
seen
him
actually
doing
it.
He
foresaw
some
danger
to
the
collection.
Was
it
because
he
foresaw
it
that
he
abandoned
his
charge
of
it?
But
if
so,
why
should
he
hesitate
to
warn
Mortimer
in
his
own
name?
I
puzzled
and
puzzled
until
at
last
I
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep,
which
carried
me
beyond
my
usual
hour
of
rising.
I
was
aroused
in
a
singular
and
effective
method,
for
about
nine
o'clock
my
friend
Mortimer
rushed
into
my
room
with
an
expression
of
consternation
upon
his
face.
He
was
usually
one
of
the
most
tidy
men
of
my
acquaintance,
but
now
his
collar
was
undone
at
one
end,
his
tie
was
flying,
and
his
hat
at
the
back
of
his
head.
I
read
his
whole
story
in
his
frantic
eyes.
"The
museum
has
been
robbed!"
I
cried,
springing
up
in
bed.
"I
fear
so!
Those
jewels!
The
jewels
of
the
urim
and
thummim!"
he
gasped,
for
he
was
out
of
breath
with
running.
"I'm
going
on
to
the
police
station.
Come
to
the
museum
as
soon
as
you
can,
Jackson!
Good
bye!"
He
rushed
distractedly
out
of
the
room,
and
I
heard
him
clatter
down
the
stairs.
I
was
not
long
in
following
his
directions,
but
I
found
when
I
arrived
that
he
had
already
returned
with
a
police
inspector,
and
another
elderly
gentleman,
who
proved
to
be
Mr.
Purvis,
one
of
the
partners
of
Morson
and
Company,
the
well
known
diamond
merchants.
As
an
expert
in
stones
he
was
always
prepared
to
advise
the
police.
They
were
grouped
round
the
case
in
which
the
breastplate
of
the
Jewish
priest
had
been
exposed.
The
plate
had
been
taken
out
and
laid
upon
the
glass
top
of
the
case,
and
the
three
heads
were
bent
over
it.
"It
is
obvious
that
it
has
been
tampered
with,"
said
Mortimer.
"It
caught
my
eye
the
moment
that
I
passed
through
the
room
this
morning.
I
examined
it
yesterday
evening,
so
that
it
is
certain
that
this
has
happened
during
the
night."
It
was,
as
he
had
said,
obvious
that
someone
had
been
at
work
upon
it.
The
settings
of
the
uppermost
row
of
four
stones
the
carnelian,
peridot,
emerald,
and
ruby
were
rough
and
jagged
as
if
someone
had
scraped
all
round
them.
The
stones
were
in
their
places,
but
the
beautiful
gold
work
which
we
had
admired
only
a
few
days
before
had
been
very
clumsily
pulled
about.
"It
looks
to
me,"
said
the
police
inspector,
"as
if
someone
had
been
trying
to
take
out
the
stones."
"My
fear
is,"
said
Mortimer,
"that
he
not
only
tried,
but
succeeded.
I
believe
these
four
stones
to
be
skilful
imitations
which
have
been
put
in
the
place
of
the
originals."
The
same
suspicion
had
evidently
been
in
the
mind
of
the
expert,
for
he
had
been
carefully
examining
the
four
stones
with
the
aid
of
a
lens.
He
now
submitted
them
to
several
tests,
and
finally
turned
cheerfully
to
Mortimer.
"I
congratulate
you,
sir,"
said
he,
heartily.
"I
will
pledge
my
reputation
that
all
four
of
these
stones
are
genuine,
and
of
a
most
unusual
degree
of
purity."
The
colour
began
to
come
back
to
my
poor
friend's
frightened
face,
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief.
"Thank
God!"
he
cried.
"Then
what
in
the
world
did
the
thief
want?"
"Probably
he
meant
to
take
the
stones,
but
was
interrupted."
"In
that
case
one
would
expect
him
to
take
them
out
one
at
a
time,
but
the
setting
of
each
of
these
has
been
loosened,
and
yet
the
stones
are
all
here."
"It
is
certainly
most
extraordinary,"
said
the
inspector.
"I
never
remember
a
case
like
it.
Let
us
see
the
watchman."
The
commissionaire
was
called
a
soldierly,
honest
faced
man,
who
seemed
as
concerned
as
Ward
Mortimer
at
the
incident.
"No,
sir,
I
never
heard
a
sound,"
he
answered,
in
reply
to
the
questions
of
the
inspector.
"I
made
my
rounds
four
times,
as
usual,
but
I
saw
nothing
suspicious.
I've
been
in
my
position
ten
years,
but
nothing
of
the
kind
has
ever
occurred
before."
"No
thief
could
have
come
through
the
windows?"
"Impossible,
sir."
"Or
passed
you
at
the
door?"
"No,
sir;
I
never
left
my
post
except
when
I
walked
my
rounds."
"What
other
openings
are
there
in
the
museum?"
"There
is
the
door
into
Mr.
Ward
Mortimer's
private
rooms."
"That
is
locked
at
night,"
my
friend
explained,
"and
in
order
to
reach
it
anyone
from
the
street
would
have
to
open
the
outside
door
as
well."
"Your
servants?"
"Their
quarters
are
entirely
separate."
"Well,
well,"
said
the
inspector,
"this
is
certainly
very
obscure.
However,
there
has
been
no
harm
done,
according
to
Mr.
Purvis."
"I
will
swear
that
those
stones
are
genuine."
"So
that
the
case
appears
to
be
merely
one
of
malicious
damage.
But
none
the
less,
I
should
be
very
glad
to
go
carefully
round
the
premises,
and
to
see
if
we
can
find
any
trace
to
show
us
who
your
visitor
may
have
been."
His
investigation,
which
lasted
all
the
morning,
was
careful
and
intelligent,
but
it
led
in
the
end
to
nothing.
He
pointed
out
to
us
that
there
were
two
possible
entrances
to
the
museum
which
we
had
not
considered.
The
one
was
from
the
cellars
by
a
trap
door
opening
in
the
passage.
The
other
through
a
skylight
from
the
lumber
room,
overlooking
that
very
chamber
to
which
the
intruder
had
penetrated.
As
neither
the
cellar
nor
the
lumber
room
could
be
entered
unless
the
thief
was
already
within
the
locked
doors,
the
matter
was
not
of
any
practical
importance,
and
the
dust
of
cellar
and
attic
assured
us
that
no
one
had
used
either
one
or
the
other.
Finally,
we
ended
as
we
began,
without
the
slightest
clue
as
to
how,
why,
or
by
whom
