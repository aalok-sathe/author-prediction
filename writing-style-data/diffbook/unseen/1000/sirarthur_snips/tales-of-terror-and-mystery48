and
finally
went
early
to
bed.
And
then
it
was
that,
for
the
first
time,
the
suspicion
that
Lord
Linchmere
was
a
lunatic
crossed
my
mind.
He
followed
me
into
my
bedroom,
when
our
host
had
retired.
"Doctor,"
said
he,
speaking
in
a
low,
hurried
voice,
"you
must
come
with
me.
You
must
spend
the
night
in
my
bedroom."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"I
prefer
not
to
explain.
But
this
is
part
of
your
duties.
My
room
is
close
by,
and
you
can
return
to
your
own
before
the
servant
calls
you
in
the
morning."
"But
why?"
I
asked.
"Because
I
am
nervous
of
being
alone,"
said
he.
"That's
the
reason,
since
you
must
have
a
reason."
It
seemed
rank
lunacy,
but
the
argument
of
those
twenty
pounds
would
overcome
many
objections.
I
followed
him
to
his
room.
"Well,"
said
I,
"there's
only
room
for
one
in
that
bed."
"Only
one
shall
occupy
it,"
said
he.
"And
the
other?"
"Must
remain
on
watch."
"Why?"
said
I.
"One
would
think
you
expected
to
be
attacked."
"Perhaps
I
do."
"In
that
case,
why
not
lock
your
door?"
"Perhaps
I
WANT
to
be
attacked."
It
looked
more
and
more
like
lunacy.
However,
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
submit.
I
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
sat
down
in
the
arm
chair
beside
the
empty
fireplace.
"I
am
to
remain
on
watch,
then?"
said
I,
ruefully.
"We
will
divide
the
night.
If
you
will
watch
until
two,
I
will
watch
the
remainder."
"Very
good."
"Call
me
at
two
o'clock,
then."
"I
will
do
so."
"Keep
your
ears
open,
and
if
you
hear
any
sounds
wake
me
instantly
instantly,
you
hear?"
"You
can
rely
upon
it."
I
tried
to
look
as
solemn
as
he
did.
"And
for
God's
sake
don't
go
to
sleep,"
said
he,
and
so,
taking
off
only
his
coat,
he
threw
the
coverlet
over
him
and
settled
down
for
the
night.
It
was
a
melancholy
vigil,
and
made
more
so
by
my
own
sense
of
its
folly.
Supposing
that
by
any
chance
Lord
Linchmere
had
cause
to
suspect
that
he
was
subject
to
danger
in
the
house
of
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter,
why
on
earth
could
he
not
lock
his
door
and
so
protect
himself?
His
own
answer
that
he
might
wish
to
be
attacked
was
absurd.
Why
should
he
possibly
wish
to
be
attacked?
And
who
would
wish
to
attack
him?
Clearly,
Lord
Linchmere
was
suffering
from
some
singular
delusion,
and
the
result
was
that
on
an
imbecile
pretext
I
was
to
be
deprived
of
my
night's
rest.
Still,
however
absurd,
I
was
determined
to
carry
out
his
injunctions
to
the
letter
as
long
as
I
was
in
his
employment.
I
sat,
therefore,
beside
the
empty
fireplace,
and
listened
to
a
sonorous
chiming
clock
somewhere
down
the
passage
which
gurgled
and
struck
every
quarter
of
an
hour.
It
was
an
endless
vigil.
Save
for
that
single
clock,
an
absolute
silence
reigned
throughout
the
great
house.
A
small
lamp
stood
on
the
table
at
my
elbow,
throwing
a
circle
of
light
round
my
chair,
but
leaving
the
corners
of
the
room
draped
in
shadow.
On
the
bed
Lord
Linchmere
was
breathing
peacefully.
I
envied
him
his
quiet
sleep,
and
again
and
again
my
own
eyelids
drooped,
but
every
time
my
sense
of
duty
came
to
my
help,
and
I
sat
up,
rubbing
my
eyes
and
pinching
myself
with
a
determination
to
see
my
irrational
watch
to
an
end.
And
I
did
so.
From
down
the
passage
came
the
chimes
of
two
o'clock,
and
I
laid
my
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
sleeper.
Instantly
he
was
sitting
up,
with
an
expression
of
the
keenest
interest
upon
his
face.
"You
have
heard
something?"
"No,
sir.
It
is
two
o'clock."
"Very
good.
I
will
watch.
You
can
go
to
sleep."
I
lay
down
under
the
coverlet
as
he
had
done
and
was
soon
unconscious.
My
last
recollection
was
of
that
circle
of
lamplight,
and
of
the
small,
hunched
up
figure
and
strained,
anxious
face
of
Lord
Linchmere
in
the
centre
of
it.
How
long
I
slept
I
do
not
know;
but
I
was
suddenly
aroused
by
a
sharp
tug
at
my
sleeve.
The
room
was
in
darkness,
but
a
hot
smell
of
oil
told
me
that
the
lamp
had
only
that
instant
been
extinguished.
"Quick!
Quick!"
said
Lord
Linchmere's
voice
in
my
ear.
I
sprang
out
of
bed,
he
still
dragging
at
my
arm.
"Over
here!"
he
whispered,
and
pulled
me
into
a
corner
of
the
room.
"Hush!
Listen!"
In
the
silence
of
the
night
I
could
distinctly
hear
that
someone
was
coming
down
the
corridor.
It
was
a
stealthy
step,
faint
and
intermittent,
as
of
a
man
who
paused
cautiously
after
every
stride.
Sometimes
for
half
a
minute
there
was
no
sound,
and
then
came
the
shuffle
and
creak
which
told
of
a
fresh
advance.
My
companion
was
trembling
with
excitement.
His
hand,
which
still
held
my
sleeve,
twitched
like
a
branch
in
the
wind.
"What
is
it?"
I
whispered.
"It's
he!"
"Sir
Thomas?"
"Yes."
"What
does
he
want?"
"Hush!
Do
nothing
until
I
tell
you."
I
was
conscious
now
that
someone
was
trying
the
door.
There
was
the
faintest
little
rattle
from
the
handle,
and
then
I
dimly
saw
a
thin
slit
of
subdued
light.
There
was
a
lamp
burning
somewhere
far
down
the
passage,
and
it
just
sufficed
to
make
the
outside
visible
from
the
darkness
of
our
room.
The
greyish
slit
grew
broader
and
broader,
very
gradually,
very
gently,
and
then
outlined
against
it
I
saw
the
dark
figure
of
a
man.
He
was
squat
and
crouching,
with
the
silhouette
of
a
bulky
and
misshapen
dwarf.
Slowly
the
door
swung
open
with
this
ominous
shape
framed
in
the
centre
of
it.
And
then,
in
an
instant,
the
crouching
figure
shot
up,
there
was
a
tiger
spring
across
the
room
and
thud,
thud,
thud,
came
three
tremendous
blows
from
some
heavy
object
upon
the
bed.
I
was
so
paralysed
with
amazement
that
