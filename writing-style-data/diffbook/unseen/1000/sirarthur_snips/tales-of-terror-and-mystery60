for
the
object
of
his
wrath
was
none
other
than
the
aged
charwoman
whom
I
have
already
mentioned
as
being
the
one
person
who
was
allowed
within
his
mysterious
chamber.
I
was
passing
the
corridor
which
led
to
the
turret
for
my
own
room
lay
in
that
direction
when
I
heard
a
sudden,
startled
scream,
and
merged
in
it
the
husky,
growling
note
of
a
man
who
is
inarticulate
with
passion.
It
was
the
snarl
of
a
furious
wild
beast.
Then
I
heard
his
voice
thrilling
with
anger.
"You
would
dare!"
he
cried.
"You
would
dare
to
disobey
my
directions!"
An
instant
later
the
charwoman
passed
me,
flying
down
the
passage,
white
faced
and
tremulous,
while
the
terrible
voice
thundered
behind
her.
"Go
to
Mrs.
Stevens
for
your
money!
Never
set
foot
in
Thorpe
Place
again!"
Consumed
with
curiosity,
I
could
not
help
following
the
woman,
and
found
her
round
the
corner
leaning
against
the
wall
and
palpitating
like
a
frightened
rabbit.
"What
is
the
matter,
Mrs.
Brown?"
I
asked.
"It's
master!"
she
gasped.
"Oh,
'ow
'e
frightened
me!
If
you
had
seen
'is
eyes,
Mr.
Colmore,
sir.
I
thought
'e
would
'ave
been
the
death
of
me."
"But
what
had
you
done?"
"Done,
sir!
Nothing.
At
least
nothing
to
make
so
much
of.
Just
laid
my
'and
on
that
black
box
of
'is
'adn't
even
opened
it,
when
in
'e
came
and
you
'eard
the
way
'e
went
on.
I've
lost
my
place,
and
glad
I
am
of
it,
for
I
would
never
trust
myself
within
reach
of
'im
again."
So
it
was
the
japanned
box
which
was
the
cause
of
this
outburst
the
box
from
which
he
would
never
permit
himself
to
be
separated.
What
was
the
connection,
or
was
there
any
connection
between
this
and
the
secret
visits
of
the
lady
whose
voice
I
had
overheard?
Sir
John
Bollamore's
wrath
was
enduring
as
well
as
fiery,
for
from
that
day
Mrs.
Brown,
the
charwoman,
vanished
from
our
ken,
and
Thorpe
Place
knew
her
no
more.
And
now
I
wish
to
tell
you
the
singular
chance
which
solved
all
these
strange
questions
and
put
my
employer's
secret
in
my
possession.
The
story
may
leave
you
with
some
lingering
doubts
as
to
whether
my
curiosity
did
not
get
the
better
of
my
honour,
and
whether
I
did
not
condescend
to
play
the
spy.
If
you
choose
to
think
so
I
cannot
help
it,
but
can
only
assure
you
that,
improbable
as
it
may
appear,
the
matter
came
about
exactly
as
I
describe
it.
The
first
stage
in
this
denouement
was
that
the
small
room
in
the
turret
became
uninhabitable.
This
occurred
through
the
fall
of
the
worm
eaten
oaken
beam
which
supported
the
ceiling.
Rotten
with
age,
it
snapped
in
the
middle
one
morning,
and
brought
down
a
quantity
of
plaster
with
it.
Fortunately
Sir
John
was
not
in
the
room
at
the
time.
His
precious
box
was
rescued
from
amongst
the
debris
and
brought
into
the
library,
where,
henceforward,
it
was
locked
within
his
bureau.
Sir
John
took
no
steps
to
repair
the
damage,
and
I
never
had
an
opportunity
of
searching
for
that
secret
passage,
the
existence
of
which
I
had
surmised.
As
to
the
lady,
I
had
thought
that
this
would
have
brought
her
visits
to
an
end,
had
I
not
one
evening
heard
Mr.
Richards
asking
Mrs.
Stevens
who
the
woman
was
whom
he
had
overheard
talking
to
Sir
John
in
the
library.
I
could
not
catch
her
reply,
but
I
saw
from
her
manner
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
had
to
answer
or
avoid
the
same
question.
"You've
heard
the
voice,
Colmore?"
said
the
agent.
I
confessed
that
I
had.
"And
what
do
YOU
think
of
it?"
I
shrugged
my
shoulders,
and
remarked
that
it
was
no
business
of
mine.
"Come,
come,
you
are
just
as
curious
as
any
of
us.
Is
it
a
woman
or
not?"
"It
is
certainly
a
woman."
"Which
room
did
you
hear
it
from?"
"From
the
turret
room,
before
the
ceiling
fell."
"But
I
heard
it
from
the
library
only
last
night.
I
passed
the
doors
as
I
was
going
to
bed,
and
I
heard
something
wailing
and
praying
just
as
plainly
as
I
hear
you.
It
may
be
a
woman
"
"Why,
what
else
COULD
it
be?"
He
looked
at
me
hard.
"There
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth,"
said
he.
"If
it
is
a
woman,
how
does
she
get
there?"
"I
don't
know."
"No,
nor
I.
But
if
it
is
the
other
thing
but
there,
for
a
practical
business
man
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
this
is
rather
a
ridiculous
line
of
conversation."
He
turned
away,
but
I
saw
that
he
felt
even
more
than
he
had
said.
To
all
the
old
ghost
stories
of
Thorpe
Place
a
new
one
was
being
added
before
our
very
eyes.
It
may
by
this
time
have
taken
its
permanent
place,
for
though
an
explanation
came
to
me,
it
never
reached
the
others.
And
my
explanation
came
in
this
way.
I
had
suffered
a
sleepless
night
from
neuralgia,
and
about
midday
I
had
taken
a
heavy
dose
of
chlorodyne
to
alleviate
the
pain.
At
that
time
I
was
finishing
the
indexing
of
Sir
John
Bollamore's
library,
and
it
was
my
custom
to
work
there
from
five
till
seven.
On
this
particular
day
I
struggled
against
the
double
effect
of
my
bad
night
and
the
narcotic.
I
have
already
mentioned
that
there
was
a
recess
in
the
library,
and
in
this
it
was
my
habit
to
work.
I
settled
down
steadily
to
my
task,
but
my
weariness
overcame
me
and,
falling
back
upon
the
settee,
I
dropped
into
a
heavy
sleep.
How
long
I
slept
I
do
not
know,
but
it
was
quite
dark
when
I
awoke.
Confused
by
the
chlorodyne
which
I
had
taken,
I
lay
motionless
in
a
semi
conscious
state.
The
great
room
with
its
high
walls
covered
with
books
loomed
