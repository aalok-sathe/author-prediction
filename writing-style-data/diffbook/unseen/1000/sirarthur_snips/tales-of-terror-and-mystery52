of
the
affair
might
be
surmised
without
any
great
breach
of
probability.
But
what
the
second
stage
had
been,
or
how
the
final
one
had
been
arrived
at,
neither
the
guard
nor
the
experienced
detective
officers
could
suggest.
A
careful
examination
of
the
line
between
Willesden
and
Rugby
resulted
in
one
discovery
which
might
or
might
not
have
a
bearing
upon
the
tragedy.
Near
Tring,
at
the
very
place
where
the
train
slowed
down,
there
was
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
embankment
a
small
pocket
Testament,
very
shabby
and
worn.
It
was
printed
by
the
Bible
Society
of
London,
and
bore
an
inscription:
"From
John
to
Alice.
Jan.
13th,
1856,"
upon
the
fly
leaf.
Underneath
was
written:
"James.
July
4th,
1859,"
and
beneath
that
again:
"Edward.
Nov.
1st,
1869,"
all
the
entries
being
in
the
same
handwriting.
This
was
the
only
clue,
if
it
could
be
called
a
clue,
which
the
police
obtained,
and
the
coroner's
verdict
of
"Murder
by
a
person
or
persons
unknown"
was
the
unsatisfactory
ending
of
a
singular
case.
Advertisement,
rewards,
and
inquiries
proved
equally
fruitless,
and
nothing
could
be
found
which
was
solid
enough
to
form
the
basis
for
a
profitable
investigation.
It
would
be
a
mistake,
however,
to
suppose
that
no
theories
were
formed
to
account
for
the
facts.
On
the
contrary,
the
Press,
both
in
England
and
in
America,
teemed
with
suggestions
and
suppositions,
most
of
which
were
obviously
absurd.
The
fact
that
the
watches
were
of
American
make,
and
some
peculiarities
in
connection
with
the
gold
stopping
of
his
front
tooth,
appeared
to
indicate
that
the
deceased
was
a
citizen
of
the
United
States,
though
his
linen,
clothes
and
boots
were
undoubtedly
of
British
manufacture.
It
was
surmised,
by
some,
that
he
was
concealed
under
the
seat,
and
that,
being
discovered,
he
was
for
some
reason,
possibly
because
he
had
overheard
their
guilty
secrets,
put
to
death
by
his
fellow
passengers.
When
coupled
with
generalities
as
to
the
ferocity
and
cunning
of
anarchical
and
other
secret
societies,
this
theory
sounded
as
plausible
as
any.
The
fact
that
he
should
be
without
a
ticket
would
be
consistent
with
the
idea
of
concealment,
and
it
was
well
known
that
women
played
a
prominent
part
in
the
Nihilistic
propaganda.
On
the
other
hand,
it
was
clear,
from
the
guard's
statement,
that
the
man
must
have
been
hidden
there
BEFORE
the
others
arrived,
and
how
unlikely
the
coincidence
that
conspirators
should
stray
exactly
into
the
very
compartment
in
which
a
spy
was
already
concealed!
Besides,
this
explanation
ignored
the
man
in
the
smoking
carriage,
and
gave
no
reason
at
all
for
his
simultaneous
disappearance.
The
police
had
little
difficulty
in
showing
that
such
a
theory
would
not
cover
the
facts,
but
they
were
unprepared
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
advance
any
alternative
explanation.
There
was
a
letter
in
the
Daily
Gazette,
over
the
signature
of
a
well
known
criminal
investigator,
which
gave
rise
to
considerable
discussion
at
the
time.
He
had
formed
a
hypothesis
which
had
at
least
ingenuity
to
recommend
it,
and
I
cannot
do
better
than
append
it
in
his
own
words.
"Whatever
may
be
the
truth,"
said
he,
"it
must
depend
upon
some
bizarre
and
rare
combination
of
events,
so
we
need
have
no
hesitation
in
postulating
such
events
in
our
explanation.
In
the
absence
of
data
we
must
abandon
the
analytic
or
scientific
method
of
investigation,
and
must
approach
it
in
the
synthetic
fashion.
In
a
word,
instead
of
taking
known
events
and
deducing
from
them
what
has
occurred,
we
must
build
up
a
fanciful
explanation
if
it
will
only
be
consistent
with
known
events.
We
can
then
test
this
explanation
by
any
fresh
facts
which
may
arise.
If
they
all
fit
into
their
places,
the
probability
is
that
we
are
upon
the
right
track,
and
with
each
fresh
fact
this
probability
increases
in
a
geometrical
progression
until
the
evidence
becomes
final
and
convincing.
"Now,
there
is
one
most
remarkable
and
suggestive
fact
which
has
not
met
with
the
attention
which
it
deserves.
There
is
a
local
train
running
through
Harrow
and
King's
Langley,
which
is
timed
in
such
a
way
that
the
express
must
have
overtaken
it
at
or
about
the
period
when
it
eased
down
its
speed
to
eight
miles
an
hour
on
account
of
the
repairs
of
the
line.
The
two
trains
would
at
that
time
be
travelling
in
the
same
direction
at
a
similar
rate
of
speed
and
upon
parallel
lines.
It
is
within
every
one's
experience
how,
under
such
circumstances,
the
occupant
of
each
carriage
can
see
very
plainly
the
passengers
in
the
other
carriages
opposite
to
him.
The
lamps
of
the
express
had
been
lit
at
Willesden,
so
that
each
compartment
was
brightly
illuminated,
and
most
visible
to
an
observer
from
outside.
"Now,
the
sequence
of
events
as
I
reconstruct
them
would
be
after
this
fashion.
This
young
man
with
the
abnormal
number
of
watches
was
alone
in
the
carriage
of
the
slow
train.
His
ticket,
with
his
papers
and
gloves
and
other
things,
was,
we
will
suppose,
on
the
seat
beside
him.
He
was
probably
an
American,
and
also
probably
a
man
of
weak
intellect.
The
excessive
wearing
of
jewellery
is
an
early
symptom
in
some
forms
of
mania.
"As
he
sat
watching
the
carriages
of
the
express
which
were
(on
account
of
the
state
of
the
line)
going
at
the
same
pace
as
himself,
he
suddenly
saw
some
people
in
it
whom
he
knew.
We
will
suppose
for
the
sake
of
our
theory
that
these
people
were
a
woman
whom
he
loved
and
a
man
whom
he
hated
and
who
in
return
hated
him.
The
young
man
was
excitable
and
impulsive.
He
opened
the
door
of
his
carriage,
stepped
from
the
footboard
of
the
local
train
to
the
footboard
of
the
express,
opened
the
other
door,
and
made
his
way
into
the
presence
of
these
two
people.
The
feat
(on
the
supposition
that
the
trains
were
going
at
the
same
pace)
is
