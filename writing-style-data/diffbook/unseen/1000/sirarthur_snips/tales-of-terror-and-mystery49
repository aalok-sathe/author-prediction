I
stood
motionless
and
staring
until
I
was
aroused
by
a
yell
for
help
from
my
companion.
The
open
door
shed
enough
light
for
me
to
see
the
outline
of
things,
and
there
was
little
Lord
Linchmere
with
his
arms
round
the
neck
of
his
brother
in
law,
holding
bravely
on
to
him
like
a
game
bull
terrier
with
its
teeth
into
a
gaunt
deerhound.
The
tall,
bony
man
dashed
himself
about,
writhing
round
and
round
to
get
a
grip
upon
his
assailant;
but
the
other,
clutching
on
from
behind,
still
kept
his
hold,
though
his
shrill,
frightened
cries
showed
how
unequal
he
felt
the
contest
to
be.
I
sprang
to
the
rescue,
and
the
two
of
us
managed
to
throw
Sir
Thomas
to
the
ground,
though
he
made
his
teeth
meet
in
my
shoulder.
With
all
my
youth
and
weight
and
strength,
it
was
a
desperate
struggle
before
we
could
master
his
frenzied
struggles;
but
at
last
we
secured
his
arms
with
the
waist
cord
of
the
dressing
gown
which
he
was
wearing.
I
was
holding
his
legs
while
Lord
Linchmere
was
endeavouring
to
relight
the
lamp,
when
there
came
the
pattering
of
many
feet
in
the
passage,
and
the
butler
and
two
footmen,
who
had
been
alarmed
by
the
cries,
rushed
into
the
room.
With
their
aid
we
had
no
further
difficulty
in
securing
our
prisoner,
who
lay
foaming
and
glaring
upon
the
ground.
One
glance
at
his
face
was
enough
to
prove
that
he
was
a
dangerous
maniac,
while
the
short,
heavy
hammer
which
lay
beside
the
bed
showed
how
murderous
had
been
his
intentions.
"Do
not
use
any
violence!"
said
Lord
Linchmere,
as
we
raised
the
struggling
man
to
his
feet.
"He
will
have
a
period
of
stupor
after
this
excitement.
I
believe
that
it
is
coming
on
already."
As
he
spoke
the
convulsions
became
less
violent,
and
the
madman's
head
fell
forward
upon
his
breast,
as
if
he
were
overcome
by
sleep.
We
led
him
down
the
passage
and
stretched
him
upon
his
own
bed,
where
he
lay
unconscious,
breathing
heavily.
"Two
of
you
will
watch
him,"
said
Lord
Linchmere.
"And
now,
Dr.
Hamilton,
if
you
will
return
with
me
to
my
room,
I
will
give
you
the
explanation
which
my
horror
of
scandal
has
perhaps
caused
me
to
delay
too
long.
Come
what
may,
you
will
never
have
cause
to
regret
your
share
in
this
night's
work.
"The
case
may
be
made
clear
in
a
very
few
words,"
he
continued,
when
we
were
alone.
"My
poor
brother
in
law
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
upon
earth,
a
loving
husband
and
an
estimable
father,
but
he
comes
from
a
stock
which
is
deeply
tainted
with
insanity.
He
has
more
than
once
had
homicidal
outbreaks,
which
are
the
more
painful
because
his
inclination
is
always
to
attack
the
very
person
to
whom
he
is
most
attached.
His
son
was
sent
away
to
school
to
avoid
this
danger,
and
then
came
an
attempt
upon
my
sister,
his
wife,
from
which
she
escaped
with
injuries
that
you
may
have
observed
when
you
met
her
in
London.
You
understand
that
he
knows
nothing
of
the
matter
when
he
is
in
his
sound
senses,
and
would
ridicule
the
suggestion
that
he
could
under
any
circumstances
injure
those
whom
he
loves
so
dearly.
It
is
often,
as
you
know,
a
characteristic
of
such
maladies
that
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
convince
the
man
who
suffers
from
them
of
their
existence.
"Our
great
object
was,
of
course,
to
get
him
under
restraint
before
he
could
stain
his
hands
with
blood,
but
the
matter
was
full
of
difficulty.
He
is
a
recluse
in
his
habits,
and
would
not
see
any
medical
man.
Besides,
it
was
necessary
for
our
purpose
that
the
medical
man
should
convince
himself
of
his
insanity;
and
he
is
sane
as
you
or
I,
save
on
these
very
rare
occasions.
But,
fortunately,
before
he
has
these
attacks
he
always
shows
certain
premonitory
symptoms,
which
are
providential
danger
signals,
warning
us
to
be
upon
our
guard.
The
chief
of
these
is
that
nervous
contortion
of
the
forehead
which
you
must
have
observed.
This
is
a
phenomenon
which
always
appears
from
three
to
four
days
before
his
attacks
of
frenzy.
The
moment
it
showed
itself
his
wife
came
into
town
on
some
pretext,
and
took
refuge
in
my
house
in
Brook
Street.
"It
remained
for
me
to
convince
a
medical
man
of
Sir
Thomas's
insanity,
without
which
it
was
impossible
to
put
him
where
he
could
do
no
harm.
The
first
problem
was
how
to
get
a
medical
man
into
his
house.
I
bethought
me
of
his
interest
in
beetles,
and
his
love
for
anyone
who
shared
his
tastes.
I
advertised,
therefore,
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
in
you
the
very
man
I
wanted.
A
stout
companion
was
necessary,
for
I
knew
that
the
lunacy
could
only
be
proved
by
a
murderous
assault,
and
I
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
that
assault
would
be
made
upon
myself,
since
he
had
the
warmest
regard
for
me
in
his
moments
of
sanity.
I
think
your
intelligence
will
supply
all
the
rest.
I
did
not
know
that
the
attack
would
come
by
night,
but
I
thought
it
very
probable,
for
the
crises
of
such
cases
usually
do
occur
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning.
I
am
a
very
nervous
man
myself,
but
I
saw
no
other
way
in
which
I
could
remove
this
terrible
danger
from
my
sister's
life.
I
need
not
ask
you
whether
you
are
willing
to
sign
the
lunacy
papers."
"Undoubtedly.
But
TWO
signatures
are
necessary."
"You
forget
that
I
am
myself
a
holder
of
a
medical
degree.
I
have
the
papers
on
a
side
table
here,
so
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
sign
them
now,
we
can
have
the
patient
removed
in
the
morning."
So
that
was
my
visit
to
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter,
the
famous
beetle
hunter,
and
that
was
also
my
first
step
upon
