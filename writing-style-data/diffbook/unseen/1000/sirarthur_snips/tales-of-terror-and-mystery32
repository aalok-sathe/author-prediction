it
is
unpleasant
to
feel
that
there
is
one
person
in
the
house
who
eagerly
desires
your
departure.
Mrs.
King's
sallow
face
and
forbidding
eyes
had
become
more
and
more
hateful
to
me.
She
was
no
longer
actively
rude
her
fear
of
her
husband
prevented
her
but
she
pushed
her
insane
jealousy
to
the
extent
of
ignoring
me,
never
addressing
me,
and
in
every
way
making
my
stay
at
Greylands
as
uncomfortable
as
she
could.
So
offensive
was
her
manner
during
that
last
day,
that
I
should
certainly
have
left
had
it
not
been
for
that
interview
with
my
host
in
the
evening
which
would,
I
hoped,
retrieve
my
broken
fortunes.
It
was
very
late
when
it
occurred,
for
my
relative,
who
had
been
receiving
even
more
telegrams
than
usual
during
the
day,
went
off
to
his
study
after
dinner,
and
only
emerged
when
the
household
had
retired
to
bed.
I
heard
him
go
round
locking
the
doors,
as
custom
was
of
a
night,
and
finally
he
joined
me
in
the
billiard
room.
His
stout
figure
was
wrapped
in
a
dressing
gown,
and
he
wore
a
pair
of
red
Turkish
slippers
without
any
heels.
Settling
down
into
an
arm
chair,
he
brewed
himself
a
glass
of
grog,
in
which
I
could
not
help
noticing
that
the
whisky
considerably
predominated
over
the
water.
"My
word!"
said
he,
"what
a
night!"
It
was,
indeed.
The
wind
was
howling
and
screaming
round
the
house,
and
the
latticed
windows
rattled
and
shook
as
if
they
were
coming
in.
The
glow
of
the
yellow
lamps
and
the
flavour
of
our
cigars
seemed
the
brighter
and
more
fragrant
for
the
contrast.
"Now,
my
boy,"
said
my
host,
"we
have
the
house
and
the
night
to
ourselves.
Let
me
have
an
idea
of
how
your
affairs
stand,
and
I
will
see
what
can
be
done
to
set
them
in
order.
I
wish
to
hear
every
detail."
Thus
encouraged,
I
entered
into
a
long
exposition,
in
which
all
my
tradesmen
and
creditors
from
my
landlord
to
my
valet,
figured
in
turn.
I
had
notes
in
my
pocket
book,
and
I
marshalled
my
facts,
and
gave,
I
flatter
myself,
a
very
businesslike
statement
of
my
own
unbusinesslike
ways
and
lamentable
position.
I
was
depressed,
however,
to
notice
that
my
companion's
eyes
were
vacant
and
his
attention
elsewhere.
When
he
did
occasionally
throw
out
a
remark
it
was
so
entirely
perfunctory
and
pointless,
that
I
was
sure
he
had
not
in
the
least
followed
my
remarks.
Every
now
and
then
he
roused
himself
and
put
on
some
show
of
interest,
asking
me
to
repeat
or
to
explain
more
fully,
but
it
was
always
to
sink
once
more
into
the
same
brown
study.
At
last
he
rose
and
threw
the
end
of
his
cigar
into
the
grate.
"I'll
tell
you
what,
my
boy,"
said
he.
"I
never
had
a
head
for
figures,
so
you
will
excuse
me.
You
must
jot
it
all
down
upon
paper,
and
let
me
have
a
note
of
the
amount.
I'll
understand
it
when
I
see
it
in
black
and
white."
The
proposal
was
encouraging.
I
promised
to
do
so.
"And
now
it's
time
we
were
in
bed.
By
Jove,
there's
one
o'clock
striking
in
the
hall."
The
tingling
of
the
chiming
clock
broke
through
the
deep
roar
of
the
gale.
The
wind
was
sweeping
past
with
the
rush
of
a
great
river.
"I
must
see
my
cat
before
I
go
to
bed,"
said
my
host.
"A
high
wind
excites
him.
Will
you
come?"
"Certainly,"
said
I.
"Then
tread
softly
and
don't
speak,
for
everyone
is
asleep."
We
passed
quietly
down
the
lamp
lit
Persian
rugged
hall,
and
through
the
door
at
the
farther
end.
All
was
dark
in
the
stone
corridor,
but
a
stable
lantern
hung
on
a
hook,
and
my
host
took
it
down
and
lit
it.
There
was
no
grating
visible
in
the
passage,
so
I
knew
that
the
beast
was
in
its
cage.
"Come
in!"
said
my
relative,
and
opened
the
door.
A
deep
growling
as
we
entered
showed
that
the
storm
had
really
excited
the
creature.
In
the
flickering
light
of
the
lantern,
we
saw
it,
a
huge
black
mass
coiled
in
the
corner
of
its
den
and
throwing
a
squat,
uncouth
shadow
upon
the
whitewashed
wall.
Its
tail
switched
angrily
among
the
straw.
"Poor
Tommy
is
not
in
the
best
of
tempers,"
said
Everard
King,
holding
up
the
lantern
and
looking
in
at
him.
"What
a
black
devil
he
looks,
doesn't
he?
I
must
give
him
a
little
supper
to
put
him
in
a
better
humour.
Would
you
mind
holding
the
lantern
for
a
moment?"
I
took
it
from
his
hand
and
he
stepped
to
the
door.
"His
larder
is
just
outside
here,"
said
he.
"You
will
excuse
me
for
an
instant
won't
you?"
He
passed
out,
and
the
door
shut
with
a
sharp
metallic
click
behind
him.
That
hard
crisp
sound
made
my
heart
stand
still.
A
sudden
wave
of
terror
passed
over
me.
A
vague
perception
of
some
monstrous
treachery
turned
me
cold.
I
sprang
to
the
door,
but
there
was
no
handle
upon
the
inner
side.
"Here!"
I
cried.
"Let
me
out!"
"All
right!
Don't
make
a
row!"
said
my
host
from
the
passage.
"You've
got
the
light
all
right."
"Yes,
but
I
don't
care
about
being
locked
in
alone
like
this."
"Don't
you?"
I
heard
his
hearty,
chuckling
laugh.
"You
won't
be
alone
long."
"Let
me
out,
sir!"
I
repeated
angrily.
"I
tell
you
I
don't
allow
practical
jokes
of
this
sort."
"Practical
is
the
word,"
said
he,
with
another
hateful
chuckle.
And
then
suddenly
I
heard,
amidst
the
roar
of
the
storm,
the
creak
and
whine
of
the
winch
handle
turning
and
the
rattle
of
the
grating
as
it
passed
through
the
slot.
Great
God,
he
was
letting
loose
the
Brazilian
cat!
In
the
light
of
the
lantern
I
saw
the
bars
sliding
slowly
before
me.
Already
there
was
an
opening
a
foot
wide
at
the
