black,
cruel
days
of
the
world's
history?
I
sank
my
throbbing
head
upon
my
shaking
hands.
And
then,
suddenly,
my
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
in
my
bosom,
and
I
could
not
even
scream,
so
great
was
my
terror.
Something
was
advancing
toward
me
through
the
darkness
of
the
room.
It
is
a
horror
coming
upon
a
horror
which
breaks
a
man's
spirit.
I
could
not
reason,
I
could
not
pray;
I
could
only
sit
like
a
frozen
image,
and
glare
at
the
dark
figure
which
was
coming
down
the
great
room.
And
then
it
moved
out
into
the
white
lane
of
moonlight,
and
I
breathed
once
more.
It
was
Dacre,
and
his
face
showed
that
he
was
as
frightened
as
myself.
"Was
that
you?
For
God's
sake
what's
the
matter?"
he
asked
in
a
husky
voice.
"Oh,
Dacre,
I
am
glad
to
see
you!
I
have
been
down
into
hell.
It
was
dreadful."
"Then
it
was
you
who
screamed?"
"I
dare
say
it
was."
"It
rang
through
the
house.
The
servants
are
all
terrified."
He
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
lamp.
"I
think
we
may
get
the
fire
to
burn
up
again,"
he
added,
throwing
some
logs
upon
the
embers.
"Good
God,
my
dear
chap,
how
white
you
are!
You
look
as
if
you
had
seen
a
ghost."
"So
I
have
several
ghosts."
"The
leather
funnel
has
acted,
then?"
"I
wouldn't
sleep
near
the
infernal
thing
again
for
all
the
money
you
could
offer
me."
Dacre
chuckled.
"I
expected
that
you
would
have
a
lively
night
of
it,"
said
he.
"You
took
it
out
of
me
in
return,
for
that
scream
of
yours
wasn't
a
very
pleasant
sound
at
two
in
the
morning.
I
suppose
from
what
you
say
that
you
have
seen
the
whole
dreadful
business."
"What
dreadful
business?"
"The
torture
of
the
water
the
'Extraordinary
Question,'
as
it
was
called
in
the
genial
days
of
'Le
Roi
Soleil.'
Did
you
stand
it
out
to
the
end?"
"No,
thank
God,
I
awoke
before
it
really
began."
"Ah!
it
is
just
as
well
for
you.
I
held
out
till
the
third
bucket.
Well,
it
is
an
old
story,
and
they
are
all
in
their
graves
now,
anyhow,
so
what
does
it
matter
how
they
got
there?
I
suppose
that
you
have
no
idea
what
it
was
that
you
have
seen?"
"The
torture
of
some
criminal.
She
must
have
been
a
terrible
malefactor
indeed
if
her
crimes
are
in
proportion
to
her
penalty."
"Well,
we
have
that
small
consolation,"
said
Dacre,
wrapping
his
dressing
gown
round
him
and
crouching
closer
to
the
fire.
"They
WERE
in
proportion
to
her
penalty.
That
is
to
say,
if
I
am
correct
in
the
lady's
identity."
"How
could
you
possibly
know
her
identity?"
For
answer
Dacre
took
down
an
old
vellum
covered
volume
from
the
shelf.
"Just
listen
to
this,"
said
he;
"it
is
in
the
French
of
the
seventeenth
century,
but
I
will
give
a
rough
translation
as
I
go.
You
will
judge
for
yourself
whether
I
have
solved
the
riddle
or
not.
"'The
prisoner
was
brought
before
the
Grand
Chambers
and
Tournelles
of
Parliament,
sitting
as
a
court
of
justice,
charged
with
the
murder
of
Master
Dreux
d'Aubray,
her
father,
and
of
her
two
brothers,
MM.
d'Aubray,
one
being
civil
lieutenant,
and
the
other
a
counsellor
of
Parliament.
In
person
it
seemed
hard
to
believe
that
she
had
really
done
such
wicked
deeds,
for
she
was
of
a
mild
appearance,
and
of
short
stature,
with
a
fair
skin
and
blue
eyes.
Yet
the
Court,
having
found
her
guilty,
condemned
her
to
the
ordinary
and
to
the
extraordinary
question
in
order
that
she
might
be
forced
to
name
her
accomplices,
after
which
she
should
be
carried
in
a
cart
to
the
Place
de
Greve,
there
to
have
her
head
cut
off,
her
body
being
afterwards
burned
and
her
ashes
scattered
to
the
winds.'
"The
date
of
this
entry
is
July
16,
1676."
"It
is
interesting,"
said
I,
"but
not
convincing.
How
do
you
prove
the
two
women
to
be
the
same?"
"I
am
coming
to
that.
The
narrative
goes
on
to
tell
of
the
woman's
behaviour
when
questioned.
'When
the
executioner
approached
her
she
recognized
him
by
the
cords
which
he
held
in
his
hands,
and
she
at
once
held
out
her
own
hands
to
him,
looking
at
him
from
head
to
foot
without
uttering
a
word.'
How's
that?"
"Yes,
it
was
so."
"'She
gazed
without
wincing
upon
the
wooden
horse
and
rings
which
had
twisted
so
many
limbs
and
caused
so
many
shrieks
of
agony.
When
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
three
pails
of
water,
which
were
all
ready
for
her,
she
said
with
a
smile,
"All
that
water
must
have
been
brought
here
for
the
purpose
of
drowning
me,
Monsieur.
You
have
no
idea,
I
trust,
of
making
a
person
of
my
small
stature
swallow
it
all."'
Shall
I
read
the
details
of
the
torture?"
"No,
for
Heaven's
sake,
don't."
"Here
is
a
sentence
which
must
surely
show
you
that
what
is
here
recorded
is
the
very
scene
which
you
have
gazed
upon
tonight:
'The
good
Abbe
Pirot,
unable
to
contemplate
the
agonies
which
were
suffered
by
his
penitent,
had
hurried
from
the
room.'
Does
that
convince
you?"
"It
does
entirely.
There
can
be
no
question
that
it
is
indeed
the
same
event.
But
who,
then,
is
this
lady
whose
appearance
was
so
attractive
and
whose
end
was
so
horrible?"
For
answer
Dacre
came
across
to
me,
and
placed
the
small
lamp
upon
the
table
which
stood
by
my
bed.
Lifting
up
the
ill
omened
filler,
he
turned
the
brass
rim
so
that
the
light
fell
full
upon
it.
Seen
in
this
way
the
engraving
seemed
clearer
than
on
the
night
before.
"We
have
already
agreed
that
this
is
the
badge
of
a
marquis
or
of
a
marquise,"
said
he.
"We
have
also
settled
that
the
last
letter
is
B."
"It
is
undoubtedly
so."
"I
now
suggest
to
you
that
