and
Sir
Colin
relieved
Lucknow
the
back
of
the
business
was
broken.
Fresh
troops
came
pouring
in,
and
Nana
Sahib
made
himself
scarce
over
the
frontier.
A
flying
column
under
Colonel
Greathed
came
round
to
Agra
and
cleared
the
Pandies
away
from
it.
Peace
seemed
to
be
settling
upon
the
country,
and
we
four
were
beginning
to
hope
that
the
time
was
at
hand
when
we
might
safely
go
off
with
our
shares
of
the
plunder.
In
a
moment,
however,
our
hopes
were
shattered
by
our
being
arrested
as
the
murderers
of
Achmet.
"It
came
about
in
this
way.
When
the
rajah
put
his
jewels
into
the
hands
of
Achmet
he
did
it
because
he
knew
that
he
was
a
trusty
man.
They
are
suspicious
folk
in
the
East,
however:
so
what
does
this
rajah
do
but
take
a
second
even
more
trusty
servant
and
set
him
to
play
the
spy
upon
the
first?
This
second
man
was
ordered
never
to
let
Achmet
out
of
his
sight,
and
he
followed
him
like
his
shadow.
He
went
after
him
that
night
and
saw
him
pass
through
the
doorway.
Of
course
he
thought
he
had
taken
refuge
in
the
fort,
and
applied
for
admission
there
himself
next
day,
but
could
find
no
trace
of
Achmet.
This
seemed
to
him
so
strange
that
he
spoke
about
it
to
a
sergeant
of
guides,
who
brought
it
to
the
ears
of
the
commandant.
A
thorough
search
was
quickly
made,
and
the
body
was
discovered.
Thus
at
the
very
moment
that
we
thought
that
all
was
safe
we
were
all
four
seized
and
brought
to
trial
on
a
charge
of
murder,
three
of
us
because
we
had
held
the
gate
that
night,
and
the
fourth
because
he
was
known
to
have
been
in
the
company
of
the
murdered
man.
Not
a
word
about
the
jewels
came
out
at
the
trial,
for
the
rajah
had
been
deposed
and
driven
out
of
India:
so
no
one
had
any
particular
interest
in
them.
The
murder,
however,
was
clearly
made
out,
and
it
was
certain
that
we
must
all
have
been
concerned
in
it.
The
three
Sikhs
got
penal
servitude
for
life,
and
I
was
condemned
to
death,
though
my
sentence
was
afterwards
commuted
into
the
same
as
the
others.
"It
was
rather
a
queer
position
that
we
found
ourselves
in
then.
There
we
were
all
four
tied
by
the
leg
and
with
precious
little
chance
of
ever
getting
out
again,
while
we
each
held
a
secret
which
might
have
put
each
of
us
in
a
palace
if
we
could
only
have
made
use
of
it.
It
was
enough
to
make
a
man
eat
his
heart
out
to
have
to
stand
the
kick
and
the
cuff
of
every
petty
jack
in
office,
to
have
rice
to
eat
and
water
to
drink,
when
that
gorgeous
fortune
was
ready
for
him
outside,
just
waiting
to
be
picked
up.
It
might
have
driven
me
mad;
but
I
was
always
a
pretty
stubborn
one,
so
I
just
held
on
and
bided
my
time.
"At
last
it
seemed
to
me
to
have
come.
I
was
changed
from
Agra
to
Madras,
and
from
there
to
Blair
Island
in
the
Andamans.
There
are
very
few
white
convicts
at
this
settlement,
and,
as
I
had
behaved
well
from
the
first,
I
soon
found
myself
a
sort
of
privileged
person.
I
was
given
a
hut
in
Hope
Town,
which
is
a
small
place
on
the
slopes
of
Mount
Harriet,
and
I
was
left
pretty
much
to
myself.
It
is
a
dreary,
fever
stricken
place,
and
all
beyond
our
little
clearings
was
infested
with
wild
cannibal
natives,
who
were
ready
enough
to
blow
a
poisoned
dart
at
us
if
they
saw
a
chance.
There
was
digging,
and
ditching,
and
yam
planting,
and
a
dozen
other
things
to
be
done,
so
we
were
busy
enough
all
day;
though
in
the
evening
we
had
a
little
time
to
ourselves.
Among
other
things,
I
learned
to
dispense
drugs
for
the
surgeon,
and
picked
up
a
smattering
of
his
knowledge.
All
the
time
I
was
on
the
lookout
for
a
chance
of
escape;
but
it
is
hundreds
of
miles
from
any
other
land,
and
there
is
little
or
no
wind
in
those
seas:
so
it
was
a
terribly
difficult
job
to
get
away.
"The
surgeon,
Dr.
Somerton,
was
a
fast,
sporting
young
chap,
and
the
other
young
officers
would
meet
in
his
rooms
of
an
evening
and
play
cards.
The
surgery,
where
I
used
to
make
up
my
drugs,
was
next
to
his
sitting
room,
with
a
small
window
between
us.
Often,
if
I
felt
lonesome,
I
used
to
turn
out
the
lamp
in
the
surgery,
and
then,
standing
there,
I
could
hear
their
talk
and
watch
their
play.
I
am
fond
of
a
hand
at
cards
myself,
and
it
was
almost
as
good
as
having
one
to
watch
the
others.
There
was
Major
Sholto,
Captain
Morstan,
and
Lieutenant
Bromley
Brown,
who
were
in
command
of
the
native
troops,
and
there
was
the
surgeon
himself,
and
two
or
three
prison
officials,
crafty
old
hands
who
played
a
nice
sly
safe
game.
A
very
snug
little
party
they
used
to
make.
"Well,
there
was
one
thing
which
very
soon
struck
me,
and
that
was
that
the
soldiers
used
always
to
lose
and
the
civilians
to
win.
Mind,
I
don't
say
that
there
was
anything
unfair,
but
so
it
was.
These
prison
chaps
had
done
little
else
than
play
cards
ever
since
they
had
been
at
the
Andamans,
and
they
knew
each
other's
game
to
a
point,
while
the
others
just
played
to
pass
the
time
and
threw
their
cards
down
anyhow.
Night
after
night
the
soldiers
got
up
poorer
men,
and
the
poorer
they
got
the
more
keen
they
were
to
play.
Major
Sholto
was
the
hardest
hit.
He
used
to
pay
in
notes
and
gold
at
first,
but
soon
it
came
to
notes
of
hand
and
for
big
sums.
He
sometimes
would
win
for
