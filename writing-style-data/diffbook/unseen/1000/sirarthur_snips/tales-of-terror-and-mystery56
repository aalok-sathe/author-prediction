which
would
have
struck
me
passed
through
the
heart
of
my
unfortunate
brother.
"He
dropped
without
a
groan
upon
the
floor
of
the
compartment,
and
MacCoy
and
I,
equally
horrified,
knelt
at
each
side
of
him,
trying
to
bring
back
some
signs
of
life.
MacCoy
still
held
the
loaded
revolver
in
his
hand,
but
his
anger
against
me
and
my
resentment
towards
him
had
both
for
the
moment
been
swallowed
up
in
this
sudden
tragedy.
It
was
he
who
first
realized
the
situation.
The
train
was
for
some
reason
going
very
slowly
at
the
moment,
and
he
saw
his
opportunity
for
escape.
In
an
instant
he
had
the
door
open,
but
I
was
as
quick
as
he,
and
jumping
upon
him
the
two
of
us
fell
off
the
footboard
and
rolled
in
each
other's
arms
down
a
steep
embankment.
At
the
bottom
I
struck
my
head
against
a
stone,
and
I
remembered
nothing
more.
When
I
came
to
myself
I
was
lying
among
some
low
bushes,
not
far
from
the
railroad
track,
and
somebody
was
bathing
my
head
with
a
wet
handkerchief.
It
was
Sparrow
MacCoy.
"'I
guess
I
couldn't
leave
you,'
said
he.
'I
didn't
want
to
have
the
blood
of
two
of
you
on
my
hands
in
one
day.
You
loved
your
brother,
I've
no
doubt;
but
you
didn't
love
him
a
cent
more
than
I
loved
him,
though
you'll
say
that
I
took
a
queer
way
to
show
it.
Anyhow,
it
seems
a
mighty
empty
world
now
that
he
is
gone,
and
I
don't
care
a
continental
whether
you
give
me
over
to
the
hangman
or
not.'
"He
had
turned
his
ankle
in
the
fall,
and
there
we
sat,
he
with
his
useless
foot,
and
I
with
my
throbbing
head,
and
we
talked
and
talked
until
gradually
my
bitterness
began
to
soften
and
to
turn
into
something
like
sympathy.
What
was
the
use
of
revenging
his
death
upon
a
man
who
was
as
much
stricken
by
that
death
as
I
was?
And
then,
as
my
wits
gradually
returned,
I
began
to
realize
also
that
I
could
do
nothing
against
MacCoy
which
would
not
recoil
upon
my
mother
and
myself.
How
could
we
convict
him
without
a
full
account
of
my
brother's
career
being
made
public
the
very
thing
which
of
all
others
we
wished
to
avoid?
It
was
really
as
much
our
interest
as
his
to
cover
the
matter
up,
and
from
being
an
avenger
of
crime
I
found
myself
changed
to
a
conspirator
against
Justice.
The
place
in
which
we
found
ourselves
was
one
of
those
pheasant
preserves
which
are
so
common
in
the
Old
Country,
and
as
we
groped
our
way
through
it
I
found
myself
consulting
the
slayer
of
my
brother
as
to
how
far
it
would
be
possible
to
hush
it
up.
"I
soon
realized
from
what
he
said
that
unless
there
were
some
papers
of
which
we
knew
nothing
in
my
brother's
pockets,
there
was
really
no
possible
means
by
which
the
police
could
identify
him
or
learn
how
he
had
got
there.
His
ticket
was
in
MacCoy's
pocket,
and
so
was
the
ticket
for
some
baggage
which
they
had
left
at
the
depot.
Like
most
Americans,
he
had
found
it
cheaper
and
easier
to
buy
an
outfit
in
London
than
to
bring
one
from
New
York,
so
that
all
his
linen
and
clothes
were
new
and
unmarked.
The
bag,
containing
the
dust
cloak,
which
I
had
thrown
out
of
the
window,
may
have
fallen
among
some
bramble
patch
where
it
is
still
concealed,
or
may
have
been
carried
off
by
some
tramp,
or
may
have
come
into
the
possession
of
the
police,
who
kept
the
incident
to
themselves.
Anyhow,
I
have
seen
nothing
about
it
in
the
London
papers.
As
to
the
watches,
they
were
a
selection
from
those
which
had
been
intrusted
to
him
for
business
purposes.
It
may
have
been
for
the
same
business
purposes
that
he
was
taking
them
to
Manchester,
but
well,
it's
too
late
to
enter
into
that.
"I
don't
blame
the
police
for
being
at
fault.
I
don't
see
how
it
could
have
been
otherwise.
There
was
just
one
little
clue
that
they
might
have
followed
up,
but
it
was
a
small
one.
I
mean
that
small,
circular
mirror
which
was
found
in
my
brother's
pocket.
It
isn't
a
very
common
thing
for
a
young
man
to
carry
about
with
him,
is
it?
But
a
gambler
might
have
told
you
what
such
a
mirror
may
mean
to
a
card
sharper.
If
you
sit
back
a
little
from
the
table,
and
lay
the
mirror,
face
upwards,
upon
your
lap,
you
can
see,
as
you
deal,
every
card
that
you
give
to
your
adversary.
It
is
not
hard
to
say
whether
you
see
a
man
or
raise
him
when
you
know
his
cards
as
well
as
your
own.
It
was
as
much
a
part
of
a
sharper's
outfit
as
the
elastic
clip
upon
Sparrow
MacCoy's
arm.
Taking
that,
in
connection
with
the
recent
frauds
at
the
hotels,
the
police
might
have
got
hold
of
one
end
of
the
string.
"I
don't
think
there
is
much
more
for
me
to
explain.
We
got
to
a
village
called
Amersham
that
night
in
the
character
of
two
gentlemen
upon
a
walking
tour,
and
afterwards
we
made
our
way
quietly
to
London,
whence
MacCoy
went
on
to
Cairo
and
I
returned
to
New
York.
My
mother
died
six
months
afterwards,
and
I
am
glad
to
say
that
to
the
day
of
her
death
she
never
knew
what
happened.
She
was
always
under
the
delusion
that
Edward
was
earning
an
honest
living
in
London,
and
I
never
had
the
heart
to
tell
her
the
truth.
He
never
wrote;
but,
then,
he
never
did
write
at
any
time,
so
that
made
no
difference.
His
name
was
the
last
upon
her
lips.
"There's
just
one
other
thing
that
I
have
to
ask
you,
sir,
and
I
should
take
it
as
a
kind
return
for
