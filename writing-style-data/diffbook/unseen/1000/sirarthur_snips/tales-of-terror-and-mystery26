for
my
troglodyte
friend.
Give
me
better
health
and
a
little
spate
of
energy,
and
I
shall
try
conclusions
with
him
yet.
But
who
and
what
is
he?
Ah!
there
is
the
question
which
stands
between
me
and
my
sleep.
How
many
theories
do
I
form,
only
to
discard
each
in
turn!
It
is
all
so
utterly
unthinkable.
And
yet
the
cry,
the
footmark,
the
tread
in
the
cavern
no
reasoning
can
get
past
these
I
think
of
the
old
world
legends
of
dragons
and
of
other
monsters.
Were
they,
perhaps,
not
such
fairy
tales
as
we
have
thought?
Can
it
be
that
there
is
some
fact
which
underlies
them,
and
am
I,
of
all
mortals,
the
one
who
is
chosen
to
expose
it?
May
3.
For
several
days
I
have
been
laid
up
by
the
vagaries
of
an
English
spring,
and
during
those
days
there
have
been
developments,
the
true
and
sinister
meaning
of
which
no
one
can
appreciate
save
myself.
I
may
say
that
we
have
had
cloudy
and
moonless
nights
of
late,
which
according
to
my
information
were
the
seasons
upon
which
sheep
disappeared.
Well,
sheep
have
disappeared.
Two
of
Miss
Allerton's,
one
of
old
Pearson's
of
the
Cat
Walk,
and
one
of
Mrs.
Moulton's.
Four
in
all
during
three
nights.
No
trace
is
left
of
them
at
all,
and
the
countryside
is
buzzing
with
rumours
of
gipsies
and
of
sheep
stealers.
But
there
is
something
more
serious
than
that.
Young
Armitage
has
disappeared
also.
He
left
his
moorland
cottage
early
on
Wednesday
night
and
has
never
been
heard
of
since.
He
was
an
unattached
man,
so
there
is
less
sensation
than
would
otherwise
be
the
case.
The
popular
explanation
is
that
he
owes
money,
and
has
found
a
situation
in
some
other
part
of
the
country,
whence
he
will
presently
write
for
his
belongings.
But
I
have
grave
misgivings.
Is
it
not
much
more
likely
that
the
recent
tragedy
of
the
sheep
has
caused
him
to
take
some
steps
which
may
have
ended
in
his
own
destruction?
He
may,
for
example,
have
lain
in
wait
for
the
creature
and
been
carried
off
by
it
into
the
recesses
of
the
mountains.
What
an
inconceivable
fate
for
a
civilized
Englishman
of
the
twentieth
century!
And
yet
I
feel
that
it
is
possible
and
even
probable.
But
in
that
case,
how
far
am
I
answerable
both
for
his
death
and
for
any
other
mishap
which
may
occur?
Surely
with
the
knowledge
I
already
possess
it
must
be
my
duty
to
see
that
something
is
done,
or
if
necessary
to
do
it
myself.
It
must
be
the
latter,
for
this
morning
I
went
down
to
the
local
police
station
and
told
my
story.
The
inspector
entered
it
all
in
a
large
book
and
bowed
me
out
with
commendable
gravity,
but
I
heard
a
burst
of
laughter
before
I
had
got
down
his
garden
path.
No
doubt
he
was
recounting
my
adventure
to
his
family.
June
10.
I
am
writing
this,
propped
up
in
bed,
six
weeks
after
my
last
entry
in
this
journal.
I
have
gone
through
a
terrible
shock
both
to
mind
and
body,
arising
from
such
an
experience
as
has
seldom
befallen
a
human
being
before.
But
I
have
attained
my
end.
The
danger
from
the
Terror
which
dwells
in
the
Blue
John
Gap
has
passed
never
to
return.
Thus
much
at
least
I,
a
broken
invalid,
have
done
for
the
common
good.
Let
me
now
recount
what
occurred
as
clearly
as
I
may.
The
night
of
Friday,
May
3rd,
was
dark
and
cloudy
the
very
night
for
the
monster
to
walk.
About
eleven
o'clock
I
went
from
the
farm
house
with
my
lantern
and
my
rifle,
having
first
left
a
note
upon
the
table
of
my
bedroom
in
which
I
said
that,
if
I
were
missing,
search
should
be
made
for
me
in
the
direction
of
the
Gap.
I
made
my
way
to
the
mouth
of
the
Roman
shaft,
and,
having
perched
myself
among
the
rocks
close
to
the
opening,
I
shut
off
my
lantern
and
waited
patiently
with
my
loaded
rifle
ready
to
my
hand.
It
was
a
melancholy
vigil.
All
down
the
winding
valley
I
could
see
the
scattered
lights
of
the
farm
houses,
and
the
church
clock
of
Chapel
le
Dale
tolling
the
hours
came
faintly
to
my
ears.
These
tokens
of
my
fellow
men
served
only
to
make
my
own
position
seem
the
more
lonely,
and
to
call
for
a
greater
effort
to
overcome
the
terror
which
tempted
me
continually
to
get
back
to
the
farm,
and
abandon
for
ever
this
dangerous
quest.
And
yet
there
lies
deep
in
every
man
a
rooted
self
respect
which
makes
it
hard
for
him
to
turn
back
from
that
which
he
has
once
undertaken.
This
feeling
of
personal
pride
was
my
salvation
now,
and
it
was
that
alone
which
held
me
fast
when
every
instinct
of
my
nature
was
dragging
me
away.
I
am
glad
now
that
I
had
the
strength.
In
spite
of
all
that
is
has
cost
me,
my
manhood
is
at
least
above
reproach.
Twelve
o'clock
struck
in
the
distant
church,
then
one,
then
two.
It
was
the
darkest
hour
of
the
night.
The
clouds
were
drifting
low,
and
there
was
not
a
star
in
the
sky.
An
owl
was
hooting
somewhere
among
the
rocks,
but
no
other
sound,
save
the
gentle
sough
of
the
wind,
came
to
my
ears.
And
then
suddenly
I
heard
it!
From
far
away
down
the
tunnel
came
those
muffled
steps,
so
soft
and
yet
so
ponderous.
I
heard
also
the
rattle
of
stones
as
they
gave
way
under
that
giant
tread.
They
drew
nearer.
They
were
close
upon
me.
I
heard
the
crashing
of
the
bushes
round
the
entrance,
and
then
dimly
through
the
darkness
I
was
conscious
of
the
loom
of
some
enormous
shape,
some
monstrous
inchoate
creature,
passing
swiftly
and
very
silently
out
from
the
tunnel.
I
was
paralysed
with
fear
and
amazement.
Long
as
