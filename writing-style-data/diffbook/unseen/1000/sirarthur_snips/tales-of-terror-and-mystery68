towards
me.
His
hatred
rose
to
the
height
of
a
mania.
I
had
been
rolling
in
money
in
England,
according
to
his
account,
while
he
had
been
starving
in
South
America.
I
cannot
describe
to
you
the
threats
which
he
uttered
or
the
insults
which
he
poured
upon
me.
My
impression
is,
that
hardships
and
debauchery
had
unhinged
his
reason.
He
paced
about
the
room
like
a
wild
beast,
demanding
drink,
demanding
money,
and
all
in
the
foulest
language.
I
am
a
hot
tempered
man,
but
I
thank
God
that
I
am
able
to
say
that
I
remained
master
of
myself,
and
that
I
never
raised
a
hand
against
him.
My
coolness
only
irritated
him
the
more.
He
raved,
he
cursed,
he
shook
his
fists
in
my
face,
and
then
suddenly
a
horrible
spasm
passed
over
his
features,
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
side,
and
with
a
loud
cry
he
fell
in
a
heap
at
my
feet.
I
raised
him
up
and
stretched
him
upon
the
sofa,
but
no
answer
came
to
my
exclamations,
and
the
hand
which
I
held
in
mine
was
cold
and
clammy.
His
diseased
heart
had
broken
down.
His
own
violence
had
killed
him.
"For
a
long
time
I
sat
as
if
I
were
in
some
dreadful
dream,
staring
at
the
body
of
my
brother.
I
was
aroused
by
the
knocking
of
Mrs.
Woods,
who
had
been
disturbed
by
that
dying
cry.
I
sent
her
away
to
bed.
Shortly
afterwards
a
patient
tapped
at
the
surgery
door,
but
as
I
took
no
notice,
he
or
she
went
off
again.
Slowly
and
gradually
as
I
sat
there
a
plan
was
forming
itself
in
my
head
in
the
curious
automatic
way
in
which
plans
do
form.
When
I
rose
from
my
chair
my
future
movements
were
finally
decided
upon
without
my
having
been
conscious
of
any
process
of
thought.
It
was
an
instinct
which
irresistibly
inclined
me
towards
one
course.
"Ever
since
that
change
in
my
affairs
to
which
I
have
alluded,
Bishop's
Crossing
had
become
hateful
to
me.
My
plans
of
life
had
been
ruined,
and
I
had
met
with
hasty
judgments
and
unkind
treatment
where
I
had
expected
sympathy.
It
is
true
that
any
danger
of
scandal
from
my
brother
had
passed
away
with
his
life;
but
still,
I
was
sore
about
the
past,
and
felt
that
things
could
never
be
as
they
had
been.
It
may
be
that
I
was
unduly
sensitive,
and
that
I
had
not
made
sufficient
allowance
for
others,
but
my
feelings
were
as
I
describe.
Any
chance
of
getting
away
from
Bishop's
Crossing
and
of
everyone
in
it
would
be
most
welcome
to
me.
And
here
was
such
a
chance
as
I
could
never
have
dared
to
hope
for,
a
chance
which
would
enable
me
to
make
a
clean
break
with
the
past.
"There
was
this
dead
man
lying
upon
the
sofa,
so
like
me
that
save
for
some
little
thickness
and
coarseness
of
the
features
there
was
no
difference
at
all.
No
one
had
seen
him
come
and
no
one
would
miss
him.
We
were
both
clean
shaven,
and
his
hair
was
about
the
same
length
as
my
own.
If
I
changed
clothes
with
him,
then
Dr.
Aloysius
Lana
would
be
found
lying
dead
in
his
study,
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
an
unfortunate
fellow,
and
of
a
blighted
career.
There
was
plenty
of
ready
money
in
the
room,
and
this
I
could
carry
away
with
me
to
help
me
to
start
once
more
in
some
other
land.
In
my
brother's
clothes
I
could
walk
by
night
unobserved
as
far
as
Liverpool,
and
in
that
great
seaport
I
would
soon
find
some
means
of
leaving
the
country.
After
my
lost
hopes,
the
humblest
existence
where
I
was
unknown
was
far
preferable,
in
my
estimation,
to
a
practice,
however
successful,
in
Bishop's
Crossing,
where
at
any
moment
I
might
come
face
to
face
with
those
whom
I
should
wish,
if
it
were
possible,
to
forget.
I
determined
to
effect
the
change.
"And
I
did
so.
I
will
not
go
into
particulars,
for
the
recollection
is
as
painful
as
the
experience;
but
in
an
hour
my
brother
lay,
dressed
down
to
the
smallest
detail
in
my
clothes,
while
I
slunk
out
by
the
surgery
door,
and
taking
the
back
path
which
led
across
some
fields,
I
started
off
to
make
the
best
of
my
way
to
Liverpool,
where
I
arrived
the
same
night.
My
bag
of
money
and
a
certain
portrait
were
all
I
carried
out
of
the
house,
and
I
left
behind
me
in
my
hurry
the
shade
which
my
brother
had
been
wearing
over
his
eye.
Everything
else
of
his
I
took
with
me.
"I
give
you
my
word,
sir,
that
never
for
one
instant
did
the
idea
occur
to
me
that
people
might
think
that
I
had
been
murdered,
nor
did
I
imagine
that
anyone
might
be
caused
serious
danger
through
this
stratagem
by
which
I
endeavoured
to
gain
a
fresh
start
in
the
world.
On
the
contrary,
it
was
the
thought
of
relieving
others
from
the
burden
of
my
presence
which
was
always
uppermost
in
my
mind.
A
sailing
vessel
was
leaving
Liverpool
that
very
day
for
Corunna,
and
in
this
I
took
my
passage,
thinking
that
the
voyage
would
give
me
time
to
recover
my
balance,
and
to
consider
the
future.
But
before
I
left
my
resolution
softened.
I
bethought
me
that
there
was
one
person
in
the
world
to
whom
I
would
not
cause
an
hour
of
sadness.
She
would
mourn
me
in
her
heart,
however
harsh
and
unsympathetic
her
relatives
might
be.
She
understood
and
appreciated
the
motives
upon
which
I
had
acted,
and
if
the
rest
of
her
family
condemned
me,
she,
at
least,
would
not
forget.
And
so
I
sent
her
a
note
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
to
save
her
from
a
baseless
grief.
If
under
the
pressure
of
events
she
broke
that
seal,
she
has
my
entire
sympathy
