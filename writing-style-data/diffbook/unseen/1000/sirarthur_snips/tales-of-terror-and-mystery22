ranks
himself,
and
I
believe
that
in
his
youth
he
was
not
above
scaring
crows
in
these
very
fields.
It
is
a
most
lonely
spot,
and
the
walks
are
picturesque
in
the
extreme.
The
farm
consists
of
grazing
land
lying
at
the
bottom
of
an
irregular
valley.
On
each
side
are
the
fantastic
limestone
hills,
formed
of
rock
so
soft
that
you
can
break
it
away
with
your
hands.
All
this
country
is
hollow.
Could
you
strike
it
with
some
gigantic
hammer
it
would
boom
like
a
drum,
or
possibly
cave
in
altogether
and
expose
some
huge
subterranean
sea.
A
great
sea
there
must
surely
be,
for
on
all
sides
the
streams
run
into
the
mountain
itself,
never
to
reappear.
There
are
gaps
everywhere
amid
the
rocks,
and
when
you
pass
through
them
you
find
yourself
in
great
caverns,
which
wind
down
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth.
I
have
a
small
bicycle
lamp,
and
it
is
a
perpetual
joy
to
me
to
carry
it
into
these
weird
solitudes,
and
to
see
the
wonderful
silver
and
black
effect
when
I
throw
its
light
upon
the
stalactites
which
drape
the
lofty
roofs.
Shut
off
the
lamp,
and
you
are
in
the
blackest
darkness.
Turn
it
on,
and
it
is
a
scene
from
the
Arabian
Nights.
But
there
is
one
of
these
strange
openings
in
the
earth
which
has
a
special
interest,
for
it
is
the
handiwork,
not
of
nature,
but
of
man.
I
had
never
heard
of
Blue
John
when
I
came
to
these
parts.
It
is
the
name
given
to
a
peculiar
mineral
of
a
beautiful
purple
shade,
which
is
only
found
at
one
or
two
places
in
the
world.
It
is
so
rare
that
an
ordinary
vase
of
Blue
John
would
be
valued
at
a
great
price.
The
Romans,
with
that
extraordinary
instinct
of
theirs,
discovered
that
it
was
to
be
found
in
this
valley,
and
sank
a
horizontal
shaft
deep
into
the
mountain
side.
The
opening
of
their
mine
has
been
called
Blue
John
Gap,
a
clean
cut
arch
in
the
rock,
the
mouth
all
overgrown
with
bushes.
It
is
a
goodly
passage
which
the
Roman
miners
have
cut,
and
it
intersects
some
of
the
great
water
worn
caves,
so
that
if
you
enter
Blue
John
Gap
you
would
do
well
to
mark
your
steps
and
to
have
a
good
store
of
candles,
or
you
may
never
make
your
way
back
to
the
daylight
again.
I
have
not
yet
gone
deeply
into
it,
but
this
very
day
I
stood
at
the
mouth
of
the
arched
tunnel,
and
peering
down
into
the
black
recesses
beyond,
I
vowed
that
when
my
health
returned
I
would
devote
some
holiday
to
exploring
those
mysterious
depths
and
finding
out
for
myself
how
far
the
Roman
had
penetrated
into
the
Derbyshire
hills.
Strange
how
superstitious
these
countrymen
are!
I
should
have
thought
better
of
young
Armitage,
for
he
is
a
man
of
some
education
and
character,
and
a
very
fine
fellow
for
his
station
in
life.
I
was
standing
at
the
Blue
John
Gap
when
he
came
across
the
field
to
me.
"Well,
doctor,"
said
he,
"you're
not
afraid,
anyhow."
"Afraid!"
I
answered.
"Afraid
of
what?"
"Of
it,"
said
he,
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
towards
the
black
vault,
"of
the
Terror
that
lives
in
the
Blue
John
Cave."
How
absurdly
easy
it
is
for
a
legend
to
arise
in
a
lonely
countryside!
I
examined
him
as
to
the
reasons
for
his
weird
belief.
It
seems
that
from
time
to
time
sheep
have
been
missing
from
the
fields,
carried
bodily
away,
according
to
Armitage.
That
they
could
have
wandered
away
of
their
own
accord
and
disappeared
among
the
mountains
was
an
explanation
to
which
he
would
not
listen.
On
one
occasion
a
pool
of
blood
had
been
found,
and
some
tufts
of
wool.
That
also,
I
pointed
out,
could
be
explained
in
a
perfectly
natural
way.
Further,
the
nights
upon
which
sheep
disappeared
were
invariably
very
dark,
cloudy
nights
with
no
moon.
This
I
met
with
the
obvious
retort
that
those
were
the
nights
which
a
commonplace
sheep
stealer
would
naturally
choose
for
his
work.
On
one
occasion
a
gap
had
been
made
in
a
wall,
and
some
of
the
stones
scattered
for
a
considerable
distance.
Human
agency
again,
in
my
opinion.
Finally,
Armitage
clinched
all
his
arguments
by
telling
me
that
he
had
actually
heard
the
Creature
indeed,
that
anyone
could
hear
it
who
remained
long
enough
at
the
Gap.
It
was
a
distant
roaring
of
an
immense
volume.
I
could
not
but
smile
at
this,
knowing,
as
I
do,
the
strange
reverberations
which
come
out
of
an
underground
water
system
running
amid
the
chasms
of
a
limestone
formation.
My
incredulity
annoyed
Armitage
so
that
he
turned
and
left
me
with
some
abruptness.
And
now
comes
the
queer
point
about
the
whole
business.
I
was
still
standing
near
the
mouth
of
the
cave
turning
over
in
my
mind
the
various
statements
of
Armitage,
and
reflecting
how
readily
they
could
be
explained
away,
when
suddenly,
from
the
depth
of
the
tunnel
beside
me,
there
issued
a
most
extraordinary
sound.
How
shall
I
describe
it?
First
of
all,
it
seemed
to
be
a
great
distance
away,
far
down
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth.
Secondly,
in
spite
of
this
suggestion
of
distance,
it
was
very
loud.
Lastly,
it
was
not
a
boom,
nor
a
crash,
such
as
one
would
associate
with
falling
water
or
tumbling
rock,
but
it
was
a
high
whine,
tremulous
and
vibrating,
almost
like
the
whinnying
of
a
horse.
It
was
certainly
a
most
remarkable
experience,
and
one
which
for
a
moment,
I
must
admit,
gave
a
new
significance
to
Armitage's
words.
I
waited
by
the
Blue
John
Gap
for
half
an
hour
or
more,
but
there
was
no
return
of
the
sound,
so
at
last
I
wandered
back
to
the
farmhouse,
rather
mystified
by
what
had
occurred.
Decidedly
I
shall
explore
that
cavern
when
my
strength
is
restored.
Of
course,
