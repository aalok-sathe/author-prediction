of
my
English
agent
who
is
a
man
with
a
considerable
future
before
him,
unless
some
complaint
of
the
throat
carries
him
off
before
his
time.
He
had
charge
of
all
arrangements
at
Liverpool,
whilst
I
was
stationed
at
the
inn
at
Kenyon,
where
I
awaited
a
cipher
signal
to
act.
When
the
special
was
arranged
for,
my
agent
instantly
telegraphed
to
me
and
warned
me
how
soon
I
should
have
everything
ready.
He
himself
under
the
name
of
Horace
Moore
applied
immediately
for
a
special
also,
in
the
hope
that
he
would
be
sent
down
with
Monsieur
Caratal,
which
might
under
certain
circumstances
have
been
helpful
to
us.
If,
for
example,
our
great
coup
had
failed,
it
would
then
have
become
the
duty
of
my
agent
to
have
shot
them
both
and
destroyed
their
papers.
Caratal
was
on
his
guard,
however,
and
refused
to
admit
any
other
traveller.
My
agent
then
left
the
station,
returned
by
another
entrance,
entered
the
guard's
van
on
the
side
farthest
from
the
platform,
and
travelled
down
with
McPherson
the
guard.
"In
the
meantime
you
will
be
interested
to
know
what
my
movements
were.
Everything
had
been
prepared
for
days
before,
and
only
the
finishing
touches
were
needed.
The
side
line
which
we
had
chosen
had
once
joined
the
main
line,
but
it
had
been
disconnected.
We
had
only
to
replace
a
few
rails
to
connect
it
once
more.
These
rails
had
been
laid
down
as
far
as
could
be
done
without
danger
of
attracting
attention,
and
now
it
was
merely
a
case
of
completing
a
juncture
with
the
line,
and
arranging
the
points
as
they
had
been
before.
The
sleepers
had
never
been
removed,
and
the
rails,
fish
plates
and
rivets
were
all
ready,
for
we
had
taken
them
from
a
siding
on
the
abandoned
portion
of
the
line.
With
my
small
but
competent
band
of
workers,
we
had
everything
ready
long
before
the
special
arrived.
When
it
did
arrive,
it
ran
off
upon
the
small
side
line
so
easily
that
the
jolting
of
the
points
appears
to
have
been
entirely
unnoticed
by
the
two
travellers.
"Our
plan
had
been
that
Smith,
the
stoker,
should
chloroform
John
Slater,
the
driver,
so
that
he
should
vanish
with
the
others.
In
this
respect,
and
in
this
respect
only,
our
plans
miscarried
I
except
the
criminal
folly
of
McPherson
in
writing
home
to
his
wife.
Our
stoker
did
his
business
so
clumsily
that
Slater
in
his
struggles
fell
off
the
engine,
and
though
fortune
was
with
us
so
far
that
he
broke
his
neck
in
the
fall,
still
he
remained
as
a
blot
upon
that
which
would
otherwise
have
been
one
of
those
complete
masterpieces
which
are
only
to
be
contemplated
in
silent
admiration.
The
criminal
expert
will
find
in
John
Slater
the
one
flaw
in
all
our
admirable
combinations.
A
man
who
has
had
as
many
triumphs
as
I
can
afford
to
be
frank,
and
I
therefore
lay
my
finger
upon
John
Slater,
and
I
proclaim
him
to
be
a
flaw.
"But
now
I
have
got
our
special
train
upon
the
small
line
two
kilometres,
or
rather
more
than
one
mile,
in
length,
which
leads,
or
rather
used
to
lead,
to
the
abandoned
Heartsease
mine,
once
one
of
the
largest
coal
mines
in
England.
You
will
ask
how
it
is
that
no
one
saw
the
train
upon
this
unused
line.
I
answer
that
along
its
entire
length
it
runs
through
a
deep
cutting,
and
that,
unless
someone
had
been
on
the
edge
of
that
cutting,
he
could
not
have
seen
it.
There
WAS
someone
on
the
edge
of
that
cutting.
I
was
there.
And
now
I
will
tell
you
what
I
saw.
"My
assistant
had
remained
at
the
points
in
order
that
he
might
superintend
the
switching
off
of
the
train.
He
had
four
armed
men
with
him,
so
that
if
the
train
ran
off
the
line
we
thought
it
probable,
because
the
points
were
very
rusty
we
might
still
have
resources
to
fall
back
upon.
Having
once
seen
it
safely
on
the
side
line,
he
handed
over
the
responsibility
to
me.
I
was
waiting
at
a
point
which
overlooks
the
mouth
of
the
mine,
and
I
was
also
armed,
as
were
my
two
companions.
Come
what
might,
you
see,
I
was
always
ready.
"The
moment
that
the
train
was
fairly
on
the
side
line,
Smith,
the
stoker,
slowed
down
the
engine,
and
then,
having
turned
it
on
to
the
fullest
speed
again,
he
and
McPherson,
with
my
English
lieutenant,
sprang
off
before
it
was
too
late.
It
may
be
that
it
was
this
slowing
down
which
first
attracted
the
attention
of
the
travellers,
but
the
train
was
running
at
full
speed
again
before
their
heads
appeared
at
the
open
window.
It
makes
me
smile
to
think
how
bewildered
they
must
have
been.
Picture
to
yourself
your
own
feelings
if,
on
looking
out
of
your
luxurious
carriage,
you
suddenly
perceived
that
the
lines
upon
which
you
ran
were
rusted
and
corroded,
red
and
yellow
with
disuse
and
decay!
What
a
catch
must
have
come
in
their
breath
as
in
a
second
it
flashed
upon
them
that
it
was
not
Manchester
but
Death
which
was
waiting
for
them
at
the
end
of
that
sinister
line.
But
the
train
was
running
with
frantic
speed,
rolling
and
rocking
over
the
rotten
line,
while
the
wheels
made
a
frightful
screaming
sound
upon
the
rusted
surface.
I
was
close
to
them,
and
could
see
their
faces.
Caratal
was
praying,
I
think
there
was
something
like
a
rosary
dangling
out
of
his
hand.
The
other
roared
like
a
bull
who
smells
the
blood
of
the
slaughter
house.
He
saw
us
standing
on
the
bank,
and
he
beckoned
to
us
like
a
madman.
Then
he
tore
at
his
wrist
and
threw
his
dispatch
box
out
of
the
window
in
our
direction.
Of
course,
his
meaning
was
obvious.
Here
was
the
evidence,
and
they
would
promise
to
be
silent
if
their
lives
were
