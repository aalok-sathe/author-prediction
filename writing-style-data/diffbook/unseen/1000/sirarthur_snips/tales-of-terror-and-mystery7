the
deadly
jungle
of
the
outer
air.
"Once
out
of
danger
I
throttled
my
engine,
for
nothing
tears
a
machine
to
pieces
quicker
than
running
on
full
power
from
a
height.
It
was
a
glorious,
spiral
vol
plane
from
nearly
eight
miles
of
altitude
first,
to
the
level
of
the
silver
cloud
bank,
then
to
that
of
the
storm
cloud
beneath
it,
and
finally,
in
beating
rain,
to
the
surface
of
the
earth.
I
saw
the
Bristol
Channel
beneath
me
as
I
broke
from
the
clouds,
but,
having
still
some
petrol
in
my
tank,
I
got
twenty
miles
inland
before
I
found
myself
stranded
in
a
field
half
a
mile
from
the
village
of
Ashcombe.
There
I
got
three
tins
of
petrol
from
a
passing
motor
car,
and
at
ten
minutes
past
six
that
evening
I
alighted
gently
in
my
own
home
meadow
at
Devizes,
after
such
a
journey
as
no
mortal
upon
earth
has
ever
yet
taken
and
lived
to
tell
the
tale.
I
have
seen
the
beauty
and
I
have
seen
the
horror
of
the
heights
and
greater
beauty
or
greater
horror
than
that
is
not
within
the
ken
of
man.
"And
now
it
is
my
plan
to
go
once
again
before
I
give
my
results
to
the
world.
My
reason
for
this
is
that
I
must
surely
have
something
to
show
by
way
of
proof
before
I
lay
such
a
tale
before
my
fellow
men.
It
is
true
that
others
will
soon
follow
and
will
confirm
what
I
have
said,
and
yet
I
should
wish
to
carry
conviction
from
the
first.
Those
lovely
iridescent
bubbles
of
the
air
should
not
be
hard
to
capture.
They
drift
slowly
upon
their
way,
and
the
swift
monoplane
could
intercept
their
leisurely
course.
It
is
likely
enough
that
they
would
dissolve
in
the
heavier
layers
of
the
atmosphere,
and
that
some
small
heap
of
amorphous
jelly
might
be
all
that
I
should
bring
to
earth
with
me.
And
yet
something
there
would
surely
be
by
which
I
could
substantiate
my
story.
Yes,
I
will
go,
even
if
I
run
a
risk
by
doing
so.
These
purple
horrors
would
not
seem
to
be
numerous.
It
is
probable
that
I
shall
not
see
one.
If
I
do
I
shall
dive
at
once.
At
the
worst
there
is
always
the
shot
gun
and
my
knowledge
of
..."
Here
a
page
of
the
manuscript
is
unfortunately
missing.
On
the
next
page
is
written,
in
large,
straggling
writing:
"Forty
three
thousand
feet.
I
shall
never
see
earth
again.
They
are
beneath
me,
three
of
them.
God
help
me;
it
is
a
dreadful
death
to
die!"
Such
in
its
entirety
is
the
Joyce
Armstrong
Statement.
Of
the
man
nothing
has
since
been
seen.
Pieces
of
his
shattered
monoplane
have
been
picked
up
in
the
preserves
of
Mr.
Budd
Lushington
upon
the
borders
of
Kent
and
Sussex,
within
a
few
miles
of
the
spot
where
the
note
book
was
discovered.
If
the
unfortunate
aviator's
theory
is
correct
that
this
air
jungle,
as
he
called
it,
existed
only
over
the
south
west
of
England,
then
it
would
seem
that
he
had
fled
from
it
at
the
full
speed
of
his
monoplane,
but
had
been
overtaken
and
devoured
by
these
horrible
creatures
at
some
spot
in
the
outer
atmosphere
above
the
place
where
the
grim
relics
were
found.
The
picture
of
that
monoplane
skimming
down
the
sky,
with
the
nameless
terrors
flying
as
swiftly
beneath
it
and
cutting
it
off
always
from
the
earth
while
they
gradually
closed
in
upon
their
victim,
is
one
upon
which
a
man
who
valued
his
sanity
would
prefer
not
to
dwell.
There
are
many,
as
I
am
aware,
who
still
jeer
at
the
facts
which
I
have
here
set
down,
but
even
they
must
admit
that
Joyce
Armstrong
has
disappeared,
and
I
would
commend
to
them
his
own
words:
"This
note
book
may
explain
what
I
am
trying
to
do,
and
how
I
lost
my
life
in
doing
it.
But
no
drivel
about
accidents
or
mysteries,
if
YOU
please."
The
Leather
Funnel
My
friend,
Lionel
Dacre,
lived
in
the
Avenue
de
Wagram,
Paris.
His
house
was
that
small
one,
with
the
iron
railings
and
grass
plot
in
front
of
it,
on
the
left
hand
side
as
you
pass
down
from
the
Arc
de
Triomphe.
I
fancy
that
it
had
been
there
long
before
the
avenue
was
constructed,
for
the
grey
tiles
were
stained
with
lichens,
and
the
walls
were
mildewed
and
discoloured
with
age.
It
looked
a
small
house
from
the
street,
five
windows
in
front,
if
I
remember
right,
but
it
deepened
into
a
single
long
chamber
at
the
back.
It
was
here
that
Dacre
had
that
singular
library
of
occult
literature,
and
the
fantastic
curiosities
which
served
as
a
hobby
for
himself,
and
an
amusement
for
his
friends.
A
wealthy
man
of
refined
and
eccentric
tastes,
he
had
spent
much
of
his
life
and
fortune
in
gathering
together
what
was
said
to
be
a
unique
private
collection
of
Talmudic,
cabalistic,
and
magical
works,
many
of
them
of
great
rarity
and
value.
His
tastes
leaned
toward
the
marvellous
and
the
monstrous,
and
I
have
heard
that
his
experiments
in
the
direction
of
the
unknown
have
passed
all
the
bounds
of
civilization
and
of
decorum.
To
his
English
friends
he
never
alluded
to
such
matters,
and
took
the
tone
of
the
student
and
virtuoso;
but
a
Frenchman
whose
tastes
were
of
the
same
nature
has
assured
me
that
the
worst
excesses
of
the
black
mass
have
been
perpetrated
in
that
large
and
lofty
hall,
which
is
lined
with
the
shelves
of
his
books,
and
the
cases
of
his
museum.
Dacre's
appearance
was
enough
to
show
that
his
deep
interest
in
these
psychic
matters
was
intellectual
rather
than
spiritual.
There
was
no
trace
of
asceticism
upon
his
heavy
face,
but
there
was
much
mental
force
in
his
huge,
dome
like
skull,
which
curved
upward
from
amongst
his
thinning
locks,
like
a
snowpeak
above
its
fringe
