solemnity
into
my
soul.
Finally
I
undressed,
and
turning
out
the
lamp,
I
lay
down.
After
long
tossing
I
fell
asleep.
Let
me
try
to
describe
as
accurately
as
I
can
the
scene
which
came
to
me
in
my
dreams.
It
stands
out
now
in
my
memory
more
clearly
than
anything
which
I
have
seen
with
my
waking
eyes.
There
was
a
room
which
bore
the
appearance
of
a
vault.
Four
spandrels
from
the
corners
ran
up
to
join
a
sharp,
cup
shaped
roof.
The
architecture
was
rough,
but
very
strong.
It
was
evidently
part
of
a
great
building.
Three
men
in
black,
with
curious,
top
heavy,
black
velvet
hats,
sat
in
a
line
upon
a
red
carpeted
dais.
Their
faces
were
very
solemn
and
sad.
On
the
left
stood
two
long
gowned
men
with
port
folios
in
their
hands,
which
seemed
to
be
stuffed
with
papers.
Upon
the
right,
looking
toward
me,
was
a
small
woman
with
blonde
hair
and
singular,
light
blue
eyes
the
eyes
of
a
child.
She
was
past
her
first
youth,
but
could
not
yet
be
called
middle
aged.
Her
figure
was
inclined
to
stoutness
and
her
bearing
was
proud
and
confident.
Her
face
was
pale,
but
serene.
It
was
a
curious
face,
comely
and
yet
feline,
with
a
subtle
suggestion
of
cruelty
about
the
straight,
strong
little
mouth
and
chubby
jaw.
She
was
draped
in
some
sort
of
loose,
white
gown.
Beside
her
stood
a
thin,
eager
priest,
who
whispered
in
her
ear,
and
continually
raised
a
crucifix
before
her
eyes.
She
turned
her
head
and
looked
fixedly
past
the
crucifix
at
the
three
men
in
black,
who
were,
I
felt,
her
judges.
As
I
gazed
the
three
men
stood
up
and
said
something,
but
I
could
distinguish
no
words,
though
I
was
aware
that
it
was
the
central
one
who
was
speaking.
They
then
swept
out
of
the
room,
followed
by
the
two
men
with
the
papers.
At
the
same
instant
several
rough
looking
fellows
in
stout
jerkins
came
bustling
in
and
removed
first
the
red
carpet,
and
then
the
boards
which
formed
the
dais,
so
as
to
entirely
clear
the
room.
When
this
screen
was
removed
I
saw
some
singular
articles
of
furniture
behind
it.
One
looked
like
a
bed
with
wooden
rollers
at
each
end,
and
a
winch
handle
to
regulate
its
length.
Another
was
a
wooden
horse.
There
were
several
other
curious
objects,
and
a
number
of
swinging
cords
which
played
over
pulleys.
It
was
not
unlike
a
modern
gymnasium.
When
the
room
had
been
cleared
there
appeared
a
new
figure
upon
the
scene.
This
was
a
tall,
thin
person
clad
in
black,
with
a
gaunt
and
austere
face.
The
aspect
of
the
man
made
me
shudder.
His
clothes
were
all
shining
with
grease
and
mottled
with
stains.
He
bore
himself
with
a
slow
and
impressive
dignity,
as
if
he
took
command
of
all
things
from
the
instant
of
his
entrance.
In
spite
of
his
rude
appearance
and
sordid
dress,
it
was
now
his
business,
his
room,
his
to
command.
He
carried
a
coil
of
light
ropes
over
his
left
forearm.
The
lady
looked
him
up
and
down
with
a
searching
glance,
but
her
expression
was
unchanged.
It
was
confident
even
defiant.
But
it
was
very
different
with
the
priest.
His
face
was
ghastly
white,
and
I
saw
the
moisture
glisten
and
run
on
his
high,
sloping
forehead.
He
threw
up
his
hands
in
prayer
and
he
stooped
continually
to
mutter
frantic
words
in
the
lady's
ear.
The
man
in
black
now
advanced,
and
taking
one
of
the
cords
from
his
left
arm,
he
bound
the
woman's
hands
together.
She
held
them
meekly
toward
him
as
he
did
so.
Then
he
took
her
arm
with
a
rough
grip
and
led
her
toward
the
wooden
horse,
which
was
little
higher
than
her
waist.
On
to
this
she
was
lifted
and
laid,
with
her
back
upon
it,
and
her
face
to
the
ceiling,
while
the
priest,
quivering
with
horror,
had
rushed
out
of
the
room.
The
woman's
lips
were
moving
rapidly,
and
though
I
could
hear
nothing
I
knew
that
she
was
praying.
Her
feet
hung
down
on
either
side
of
the
horse,
and
I
saw
that
the
rough
varlets
in
attendance
had
fastened
cords
to
her
ankles
and
secured
the
other
ends
to
iron
rings
in
the
stone
floor.
My
heart
sank
within
me
as
I
saw
these
ominous
preparations,
and
yet
I
was
held
by
the
fascination
of
horror,
and
I
could
not
take
my
eyes
from
the
strange
spectacle.
A
man
had
entered
the
room
with
a
bucket
of
water
in
either
hand.
Another
followed
with
a
third
bucket.
They
were
laid
beside
the
wooden
horse.
The
second
man
had
a
wooden
dipper
a
bowl
with
a
straight
handle
in
his
other
hand.
This
he
gave
to
the
man
in
black.
At
the
same
moment
one
of
the
varlets
approached
with
a
dark
object
in
his
hand,
which
even
in
my
dream
filled
me
with
a
vague
feeling
of
familiarity.
It
was
a
leathern
filler.
With
horrible
energy
he
thrust
it
but
I
could
stand
no
more.
My
hair
stood
on
end
with
horror.
I
writhed,
I
struggled,
I
broke
through
the
bonds
of
sleep,
and
I
burst
with
a
shriek
into
my
own
life,
and
found
myself
lying
shivering
with
terror
in
the
huge
library,
with
the
moonlight
flooding
through
the
window
and
throwing
strange
silver
and
black
traceries
upon
the
opposite
wall.
Oh,
what
a
blessed
relief
to
feel
that
I
was
back
in
the
nineteenth
century
back
out
of
that
mediaeval
vault
into
a
world
where
men
had
human
hearts
within
their
bosoms.
I
sat
up
on
my
couch,
trembling
in
every
limb,
my
mind
divided
between
thankfulness
and
horror.
To
think
that
such
things
were
ever
done
that
they
could
be
done
without
God
striking
the
villains
dead.
Was
it
all
a
fantasy,
or
did
it
really
stand
for
something
which
had
happened
in
the
