the
scene
of
his
success.
Such
was
the
position
of
affairs
when,
upon
the
evening
of
Monday,
June
21st,
there
came
a
fresh
development
which
changed
what
had
been
a
mere
village
scandal
into
a
tragedy
which
arrested
the
attention
of
the
whole
nation.
Some
detail
is
necessary
to
cause
the
facts
of
that
evening
to
present
their
full
significance.
The
sole
occupants
of
the
doctor's
house
were
his
housekeeper,
an
elderly
and
most
respectable
woman,
named
Martha
Woods,
and
a
young
servant
Mary
Pilling.
The
coachman
and
the
surgery
boy
slept
out.
It
was
the
custom
of
the
doctor
to
sit
at
night
in
his
study,
which
was
next
the
surgery
in
the
wing
of
the
house
which
was
farthest
from
the
servants'
quarters.
This
side
of
the
house
had
a
door
of
its
own
for
the
convenience
of
patients,
so
that
it
was
possible
for
the
doctor
to
admit
and
receive
a
visitor
there
without
the
knowledge
of
anyone.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
when
patients
came
late
it
was
quite
usual
for
him
to
let
them
in
and
out
by
the
surgery
entrance,
for
the
maid
and
the
housekeeper
were
in
the
habit
of
retiring
early.
On
this
particular
night
Martha
Woods
went
into
the
doctor's
study
at
half
past
nine,
and
found
him
writing
at
his
desk.
She
bade
him
good
night,
sent
the
maid
to
bed,
and
then
occupied
herself
until
a
quarter
to
eleven
in
household
matters.
It
was
striking
eleven
upon
the
hall
clock
when
she
went
to
her
own
room.
She
had
been
there
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
twenty
minutes
when
she
heard
a
cry
or
call,
which
appeared
to
come
from
within
the
house.
She
waited
some
time,
but
it
was
not
repeated.
Much
alarmed,
for
the
sound
was
loud
and
urgent,
she
put
on
a
dressing
gown,
and
ran
at
the
top
of
her
speed
to
the
doctor's
study.
"Who's
there?"
cried
a
voice,
as
she
tapped
at
the
door.
"I
am
here,
sir
Mrs.
Woods."
"I
beg
that
you
will
leave
me
in
peace.
Go
back
to
your
room
this
instant!"
cried
the
voice,
which
was,
to
the
best
of
her
belief,
that
of
her
master.
The
tone
was
so
harsh
and
so
unlike
her
master's
usual
manner,
that
she
was
surprised
and
hurt.
"I
thought
I
heard
you
calling,
sir,"
she
explained,
but
no
answer
was
given
to
her.
Mrs.
Woods
looked
at
the
clock
as
she
returned
to
her
room,
and
it
was
then
half
past
eleven.
At
some
period
between
eleven
and
twelve
(she
could
not
be
positive
as
to
the
exact
hour)
a
patient
called
upon
the
doctor
and
was
unable
to
get
any
reply
from
him.
This
late
visitor
was
Mrs.
Madding,
the
wife
of
the
village
grocer,
who
was
dangerously
ill
of
typhoid
fever.
Dr.
Lana
had
asked
her
to
look
in
the
last
thing
and
let
him
know
how
her
husband
was
progressing.
She
observed
that
the
light
was
burning
in
the
study,
but
having
knocked
several
times
at
the
surgery
door
without
response,
she
concluded
that
the
doctor
had
been
called
out,
and
so
returned
home.
There
is
a
short,
winding
drive
with
a
lamp
at
the
end
of
it
leading
down
from
the
house
to
the
road.
As
Mrs.
Madding
emerged
from
the
gate
a
man
was
coming
along
the
footpath.
Thinking
that
it
might
be
Dr.
Lana
returning
from
some
professional
visit,
she
waited
for
him,
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
Mr.
Arthur
Morton,
the
young
squire.
In
the
light
of
the
lamp
she
observed
that
his
manner
was
excited,
and
that
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
heavy
hunting
crop.
He
was
turning
in
at
the
gate
when
she
addressed
him.
"The
doctor
is
not
in,
sir,"
said
she.
"How
do
you
know
that?"
he
asked
harshly.
"I
have
been
to
the
surgery
door,
sir."
"I
see
a
light,"
said
the
young
squire,
looking
up
the
drive.
"That
is
in
his
study,
is
it
not?"
"Yes,
sir;
but
I
am
sure
that
he
is
out."
"Well,
he
must
come
in
again,"
said
young
Morton,
and
passed
through
the
gate
while
Mrs.
Madding
went
upon
her
homeward
way.
At
three
o'clock
that
morning
her
husband
suffered
a
sharp
relapse,
and
she
was
so
alarmed
by
his
symptoms
that
she
determined
to
call
the
doctor
without
delay.
As
she
passed
through
the
gate
she
was
surprised
to
see
someone
lurking
among
the
laurel
bushes.
It
was
certainly
a
man,
and
to
the
best
of
her
belief
Mr.
Arthur
Morton.
Preoccupied
with
her
own
troubles,
she
gave
no
particular
attention
to
the
incident,
but
hurried
on
upon
her
errand.
When
she
reached
the
house
she
perceived
to
her
surprise
that
the
light
was
still
burning
in
the
study.
She
therefore
tapped
at
the
surgery
door.
There
was
no
answer.
She
repeated
the
knocking
several
times
without
effect.
It
appeared
to
her
to
be
unlikely
that
the
doctor
would
either
go
to
bed
or
go
out
leaving
so
brilliant
a
light
behind
him,
and
it
struck
Mrs.
Madding
that
it
was
possible
that
he
might
have
dropped
asleep
in
his
chair.
She
tapped
at
the
study
window,
therefore,
but
without
result.
Then,
finding
that
there
was
an
opening
between
the
curtain
and
the
woodwork,
she
looked
through.
The
small
room
was
brilliantly
lighted
from
a
large
lamp
on
the
central
table,
which
was
littered
with
the
doctor's
books
and
instruments.
No
one
was
visible,
nor
did
she
see
anything
unusual,
except
that
in
the
farther
shadow
thrown
by
the
table
a
dingy
white
glove
was
lying
upon
the
carpet.
And
then
suddenly,
as
her
eyes
became
more
accustomed
to
the
light,
a
boot
emerged
from
the
other
end
of
the
shadow,
and
she
realized,
with
a
thrill
of
horror,
that
what
she
had
taken
to
be
a
glove
was
the
hand
of
a
man,
who
was
prostrate
upon
the
floor.
Understanding
that
something
terrible
had
occurred,
