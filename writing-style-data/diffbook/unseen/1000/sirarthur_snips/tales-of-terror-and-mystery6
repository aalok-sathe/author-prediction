all
sizes,
but
none
so
large
as
the
first.
Some
were
quite
small,
but
the
majority
about
as
big
as
an
average
balloon,
and
with
much
the
same
curvature
at
the
top.
There
was
in
them
a
delicacy
of
texture
and
colouring
which
reminded
me
of
the
finest
Venetian
glass.
Pale
shades
of
pink
and
green
were
the
prevailing
tints,
but
all
had
a
lovely
iridescence
where
the
sun
shimmered
through
their
dainty
forms.
Some
hundreds
of
them
drifted
past
me,
a
wonderful
fairy
squadron
of
strange
unknown
argosies
of
the
sky
creatures
whose
forms
and
substance
were
so
attuned
to
these
pure
heights
that
one
could
not
conceive
anything
so
delicate
within
actual
sight
or
sound
of
earth.
"But
soon
my
attention
was
drawn
to
a
new
phenomenon
the
serpents
of
the
outer
air.
These
were
long,
thin,
fantastic
coils
of
vapour
like
material,
which
turned
and
twisted
with
great
speed,
flying
round
and
round
at
such
a
pace
that
the
eyes
could
hardly
follow
them.
Some
of
these
ghost
like
creatures
were
twenty
or
thirty
feet
long,
but
it
was
difficult
to
tell
their
girth,
for
their
outline
was
so
hazy
that
it
seemed
to
fade
away
into
the
air
around
them.
These
air
snakes
were
of
a
very
light
grey
or
smoke
colour,
with
some
darker
lines
within,
which
gave
the
impression
of
a
definite
organism.
One
of
them
whisked
past
my
very
face,
and
I
was
conscious
of
a
cold,
clammy
contact,
but
their
composition
was
so
unsubstantial
that
I
could
not
connect
them
with
any
thought
of
physical
danger,
any
more
than
the
beautiful
bell
like
creatures
which
had
preceded
them.
There
was
no
more
solidity
in
their
frames
than
in
the
floating
spume
from
a
broken
wave.
"But
a
more
terrible
experience
was
in
store
for
me.
Floating
downwards
from
a
great
height
there
came
a
purplish
patch
of
vapour,
small
as
I
saw
it
first,
but
rapidly
enlarging
as
it
approached
me,
until
it
appeared
to
be
hundreds
of
square
feet
in
size.
Though
fashioned
of
some
transparent,
jelly
like
substance,
it
was
none
the
less
of
much
more
definite
outline
and
solid
consistence
than
anything
which
I
had
seen
before.
There
were
more
traces,
too,
of
a
physical
organization,
especially
two
vast,
shadowy,
circular
plates
upon
either
side,
which
may
have
been
eyes,
and
a
perfectly
solid
white
projection
between
them
which
was
as
curved
and
cruel
as
the
beak
of
a
vulture.
"The
whole
aspect
of
this
monster
was
formidable
and
threatening,
and
it
kept
changing
its
colour
from
a
very
light
mauve
to
a
dark,
angry
purple
so
thick
that
it
cast
a
shadow
as
it
drifted
between
my
monoplane
and
the
sun.
On
the
upper
curve
of
its
huge
body
there
were
three
great
projections
which
I
can
only
describe
as
enormous
bubbles,
and
I
was
convinced
as
I
looked
at
them
that
they
were
charged
with
some
extremely
light
gas
which
served
to
buoy
up
the
misshapen
and
semi
solid
mass
in
the
rarefied
air.
The
creature
moved
swiftly
along,
keeping
pace
easily
with
the
monoplane,
and
for
twenty
miles
or
more
it
formed
my
horrible
escort,
hovering
over
me
like
a
bird
of
prey
which
is
waiting
to
pounce.
Its
method
of
progression
done
so
swiftly
that
it
was
not
easy
to
follow
was
to
throw
out
a
long,
glutinous
streamer
in
front
of
it,
which
in
turn
seemed
to
draw
forward
the
rest
of
the
writhing
body.
So
elastic
and
gelatinous
was
it
that
never
for
two
successive
minutes
was
it
the
same
shape,
and
yet
each
change
made
it
more
threatening
and
loathsome
than
the
last.
"I
knew
that
it
meant
mischief.
Every
purple
flush
of
its
hideous
body
told
me
so.
The
vague,
goggling
eyes
which
were
turned
always
upon
me
were
cold
and
merciless
in
their
viscid
hatred.
I
dipped
the
nose
of
my
monoplane
downwards
to
escape
it.
As
I
did
so,
as
quick
as
a
flash
there
shot
out
a
long
tentacle
from
this
mass
of
floating
blubber,
and
it
fell
as
light
and
sinuous
as
a
whip
lash
across
the
front
of
my
machine.
There
was
a
loud
hiss
as
it
lay
for
a
moment
across
the
hot
engine,
and
it
whisked
itself
into
the
air
again,
while
the
huge,
flat
body
drew
itself
together
as
if
in
sudden
pain.
I
dipped
to
a
vol
pique,
but
again
a
tentacle
fell
over
the
monoplane
and
was
shorn
off
by
the
propeller
as
easily
as
it
might
have
cut
through
a
smoke
wreath.
A
long,
gliding,
sticky,
serpent
like
coil
came
from
behind
and
caught
me
round
the
waist,
dragging
me
out
of
the
fuselage.
I
tore
at
it,
my
fingers
sinking
into
the
smooth,
glue
like
surface,
and
for
an
instant
I
disengaged
myself,
but
only
to
be
caught
round
the
boot
by
another
coil,
which
gave
me
a
jerk
that
tilted
me
almost
on
to
my
back.
"As
I
fell
over
I
blazed
off
both
barrels
of
my
gun,
though,
indeed,
it
was
like
attacking
an
elephant
with
a
pea
shooter
to
imagine
that
any
human
weapon
could
cripple
that
mighty
bulk.
And
yet
I
aimed
better
than
I
knew,
for,
with
a
loud
report,
one
of
the
great
blisters
upon
the
creature's
back
exploded
with
the
puncture
of
the
buck
shot.
It
was
very
clear
that
my
conjecture
was
right,
and
that
these
vast,
clear
bladders
were
distended
with
some
lifting
gas,
for
in
an
instant
the
huge,
cloud
like
body
turned
sideways,
writhing
desperately
to
find
its
balance,
while
the
white
beak
snapped
and
gaped
in
horrible
fury.
But
already
I
had
shot
away
on
the
steepest
glide
that
I
dared
to
attempt,
my
engine
still
full
on,
the
flying
propeller
and
the
force
of
gravity
shooting
me
downwards
like
an
aerolite.
Far
behind
me
I
saw
a
dull,
purplish
smudge
growing
swiftly
smaller
and
merging
into
the
blue
sky
behind
it.
I
was
safe
out
of
