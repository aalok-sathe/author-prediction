then
the
cat
sprang!
It
was
so
quick,
so
sudden,
that
I
never
saw
it
happen.
I
simply
heard
the
savage
snarl,
and
in
an
instant
afterwards
the
blazing
yellow
eyes,
the
flattened
black
head
with
its
red
tongue
and
flashing
teeth,
were
within
reach
of
me.
The
impact
of
the
creature
shook
the
bars
upon
which
I
lay,
until
I
thought
(as
far
as
I
could
think
of
anything
at
such
a
moment)
that
they
were
coming
down.
The
cat
swayed
there
for
an
instant,
the
head
and
front
paws
quite
close
to
me,
the
hind
paws
clawing
to
find
a
grip
upon
the
edge
of
the
grating.
I
heard
the
claws
rasping
as
they
clung
to
the
wire
netting,
and
the
breath
of
the
beast
made
me
sick.
But
its
bound
had
been
miscalculated.
It
could
not
retain
its
position.
Slowly,
grinning
with
rage,
and
scratching
madly
at
the
bars,
it
swung
backwards
and
dropped
heavily
upon
the
floor.
With
a
growl
it
instantly
faced
round
to
me
and
crouched
for
another
spring.
I
knew
that
the
next
few
moments
would
decide
my
fate.
The
creature
had
learned
by
experience.
It
would
not
miscalculate
again.
I
must
act
promptly,
fearlessly,
if
I
were
to
have
a
chance
for
life.
In
an
instant
I
had
formed
my
plan.
Pulling
off
my
dress
coat,
I
threw
it
down
over
the
head
of
the
beast.
At
the
same
moment
I
dropped
over
the
edge,
seized
the
end
of
the
front
grating,
and
pulled
it
frantically
out
of
the
wall.
It
came
more
easily
than
I
could
have
expected.
I
rushed
across
the
room,
bearing
it
with
me;
but,
as
I
rushed,
the
accident
of
my
position
put
me
upon
the
outer
side.
Had
it
been
the
other
way,
I
might
have
come
off
scathless.
As
it
was,
there
was
a
moment's
pause
as
I
stopped
it
and
tried
to
pass
in
through
the
opening
which
I
had
left.
That
moment
was
enough
to
give
time
to
the
creature
to
toss
off
the
coat
with
which
I
had
blinded
him
and
to
spring
upon
me.
I
hurled
myself
through
the
gap
and
pulled
the
rails
to
behind
me,
but
he
seized
my
leg
before
I
could
entirely
withdraw
it.
One
stroke
of
that
huge
paw
tore
off
my
calf
as
a
shaving
of
wood
curls
off
before
a
plane.
The
next
moment,
bleeding
and
fainting,
I
was
lying
among
the
foul
straw
with
a
line
of
friendly
bars
between
me
and
the
creature
which
ramped
so
frantically
against
them.
Too
wounded
to
move,
and
too
faint
to
be
conscious
of
fear,
I
could
only
lie,
more
dead
than
alive,
and
watch
it.
It
pressed
its
broad,
black
chest
against
the
bars
and
angled
for
me
with
its
crooked
paws
as
I
have
seen
a
kitten
do
before
a
mouse
trap.
It
ripped
my
clothes,
but,
stretch
as
it
would,
it
could
not
quite
reach
me.
I
have
heard
of
the
curious
numbing
effect
produced
by
wounds
from
the
great
carnivora,
and
now
I
was
destined
to
experience
it,
for
I
had
lost
all
sense
of
personality,
and
was
as
interested
in
the
cat's
failure
or
success
as
if
it
were
some
game
which
I
was
watching.
And
then
gradually
my
mind
drifted
away
into
strange
vague
dreams,
always
with
that
black
face
and
red
tongue
coming
back
into
them,
and
so
I
lost
myself
in
the
nirvana
of
delirium,
the
blessed
relief
of
those
who
are
too
sorely
tried.
Tracing
the
course
of
events
afterwards,
I
conclude
that
I
must
have
been
insensible
for
about
two
hours.
What
roused
me
to
consciousness
once
more
was
that
sharp
metallic
click
which
had
been
the
precursor
of
my
terrible
experience.
It
was
the
shooting
back
of
the
spring
lock.
Then,
before
my
senses
were
clear
enough
to
entirely
apprehend
what
they
saw,
I
was
aware
of
the
round,
benevolent
face
of
my
cousin
peering
in
through
the
open
door.
What
he
saw
evidently
amazed
him.
There
was
the
cat
crouching
on
the
floor.
I
was
stretched
upon
my
back
in
my
shirt
sleeves
within
the
cage,
my
trousers
torn
to
ribbons
and
a
great
pool
of
blood
all
round
me.
I
can
see
his
amazed
face
now,
with
the
morning
sunlight
upon
it.
He
peered
at
me,
and
peered
again.
Then
he
closed
the
door
behind
him,
and
advanced
to
the
cage
to
see
if
I
were
really
dead.
I
cannot
undertake
to
say
what
happened.
I
was
not
in
a
fit
state
to
witness
or
to
chronicle
such
events.
I
can
only
say
that
I
was
suddenly
conscious
that
his
face
was
away
from
me
that
he
was
looking
towards
the
animal.
"Good
old
Tommy!"
he
cried.
"Good
old
Tommy!"
Then
he
came
near
the
bars,
with
his
back
still
towards
me.
"Down,
you
stupid
beast!"
he
roared.
"Down,
sir!
Don't
you
know
your
master?"
Suddenly
even
in
my
bemuddled
brain
a
remembrance
came
of
those
words
of
his
when
he
had
said
that
the
taste
of
blood
would
turn
the
cat
into
a
fiend.
My
blood
had
done
it,
but
he
was
to
pay
the
price.
"Get
away!"
he
screamed.
"Get
away,
you
devil!
Baldwin!
Baldwin!
Oh,
my
God!"
And
then
I
heard
him
fall,
and
rise,
and
fall
again,
with
a
sound
like
the
ripping
of
sacking.
His
screams
grew
fainter
until
they
were
lost
in
the
worrying
snarl.
And
then,
after
I
thought
that
he
was
dead,
I
saw,
as
in
a
nightmare,
a
blinded,
tattered,
blood
soaked
figure
running
wildly
round
the
room
and
that
was
the
last
glimpse
which
I
had
of
him
before
I
fainted
once
again.
I
was
many
months
in
my
recovery
in
fact,
I
cannot
say
that
I
have
ever
recovered,
for
to
the
end
of
my
days
I
shall
carry
a
stick
as
a
sign
of
my
night
with
the
Brazilian
cat.
Baldwin,
the
groom,
and
the
other
servants
could
not
tell
what
