hypothesis
were
correct,
and
someone
was
with
Dr.
Lana
before
Mrs.
Madding
met
Mr.
Arthur
Morton,
then
who
was
this
someone,
and
what
motives
had
he
for
wishing
evil
to
the
doctor?
It
was
universally
admitted
that
if
the
friends
of
the
accused
could
throw
light
upon
this,
they
would
have
gone
a
long
way
towards
establishing
his
innocence.
But
in
the
meanwhile
it
was
open
to
the
public
to
say
as
they
did
say
that
there
was
no
proof
that
anyone
had
been
there
at
all
except
the
young
squire;
while,
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
ample
proof
that
his
motives
in
going
were
of
a
sinister
kind.
When
Mrs.
Madding
called,
the
doctor
might
have
retired
to
his
room,
or
he
might,
as
she
thought
at
the
time,
have
gone
out
and
returned
afterwards
to
find
Mr.
Arthur
Morton
waiting
for
him.
Some
of
the
supporters
of
the
accused
laid
stress
upon
the
fact
that
the
photograph
of
his
sister
Frances,
which
had
been
removed
from
the
doctor's
room,
had
not
been
found
in
her
brother's
possession.
This
argument,
however,
did
not
count
for
much,
as
he
had
ample
time
before
his
arrest
to
burn
it
or
to
destroy
it.
As
to
the
only
positive
evidence
in
the
case
the
muddy
footmarks
upon
the
floor
they
were
so
blurred
by
the
softness
of
the
carpet
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
any
trustworthy
deduction
from
them.
The
most
that
could
be
said
was
that
their
appearance
was
not
inconsistent
with
the
theory
that
they
were
made
by
the
accused,
and
it
was
further
shown
that
his
boots
were
very
muddy
upon
that
night.
There
had
been
a
heavy
shower
in
the
afternoon,
and
all
boots
were
probably
in
the
same
condition.
Such
is
a
bald
statement
of
the
singular
and
romantic
series
of
events
which
centred
public
attention
upon
this
Lancashire
tragedy.
The
unknown
origin
of
the
doctor,
his
curious
and
distinguished
personality,
the
position
of
the
man
who
was
accused
of
the
murder,
and
the
love
affair
which
had
preceded
the
crimes
all
combined
to
make
the
affair
one
of
those
dramas
which
absorb
the
whole
interest
of
a
nation.
Throughout
the
three
kingdoms
men
discussed
the
case
of
the
Black
Doctor
of
Bishop's
Crossing,
and
many
were
the
theories
put
forward
to
explain
the
facts;
but
it
may
safely
be
said
that
among
them
all
there
was
not
one
which
prepared
the
minds
of
the
public
for
the
extraordinary
sequel,
which
caused
so
much
excitement
upon
the
first
day
of
the
trial,
and
came
to
a
climax
upon
the
second.
The
long
files
of
the
Lancaster
Weekly
with
their
report
of
the
case
lie
before
me
as
I
write,
but
I
must
content
myself
with
a
synopsis
of
the
case
up
to
the
point
when,
upon
the
evening
of
the
first
day,
the
evidence
of
Miss
Frances
Morton
threw
a
singular
light
upon
the
case.
Mr.
Porlock
Carr,
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution,
had
marshalled
his
facts
with
his
usual
skill,
and
as
the
day
wore
on,
it
became
more
and
more
evident
how
difficult
was
the
task
which
Mr.
Humphrey,
who
had
been
retained
for
the
defence,
had
before
him.
Several
witnesses
were
put
up
to
swear
to
the
intemperate
expressions
which
the
young
squire
had
been
heard
to
utter
about
the
doctor,
and
the
fiery
manner
in
which
he
resented
the
alleged
ill
treatment
of
his
sister.
Mrs.
Madding
repeated
her
evidence
as
to
the
visit
which
had
been
paid
late
at
night
by
the
prisoner
to
the
deceased,
and
it
was
shown
by
another
witness
that
the
prisoner
was
aware
that
the
doctor
was
in
the
habit
of
sitting
up
alone
in
this
isolated
wing
of
the
house,
and
that
he
had
chosen
this
very
late
hour
to
call
because
he
knew
that
his
victim
would
then
be
at
his
mercy.
A
servant
at
the
squire's
house
was
compelled
to
admit
that
he
had
heard
his
master
return
about
three
that
morning,
which
corroborated
Mrs.
Madding's
statement
that
she
had
seen
him
among
the
laurel
bushes
near
the
gate
upon
the
occasion
of
her
second
visit.
The
muddy
boots
and
an
alleged
similarity
in
the
footprints
were
duly
dwelt
upon,
and
it
was
felt
when
the
case
for
the
prosecution
had
been
presented
that,
however
circumstantial
it
might
be,
it
was
none
the
less
so
complete
and
so
convincing,
that
the
fate
of
the
prisoner
was
sealed,
unless
something
quite
unexpected
should
be
disclosed
by
the
defence.
It
was
three
o'clock
when
the
prosecution
closed.
At
half
past
four,
when
the
court
rose,
a
new
and
unlooked
for
development
had
occurred.
I
extract
the
incident,
or
part
of
it,
from
the
journal
which
I
have
already
mentioned,
omitting
the
preliminary
observations
of
the
counsel.
Considerable
sensation
was
caused
in
the
crowded
court
when
the
first
witness
called
for
the
defence
proved
to
be
Miss
Frances
Morton,
the
sister
of
the
prisoner.
Our
readers
will
remember
that
the
young
lady
had
been
engaged
to
Dr.
Lana,
and
that
it
was
his
anger
over
the
sudden
termination
of
this
engagement
which
was
thought
to
have
driven
her
brother
to
the
perpetration
of
this
crime.
Miss
Morton
had
not,
however,
been
directly
implicated
in
the
case
in
any
way,
either
at
the
inquest
or
at
the
police
court
proceedings,
and
her
appearance
as
the
leading
witness
for
the
defence
came
as
a
surprise
upon
the
public.
Miss
Frances
Morton,
who
was
a
tall
and
handsome
brunette,
gave
her
evidence
in
a
low
but
clear
voice,
though
it
was
evident
throughout
that
she
was
suffering
from
extreme
emotion.
She
alluded
to
her
engagement
to
the
doctor,
touched
briefly
upon
its
termination,
which
was
due,
she
said,
to
personal
matters
connected
with
his
family,
and
surprised
the
court
by
asserting
that
she
had
always
considered
her
brother's
resentment
to
be
unreasonable
and
intemperate.
In
answer
to
a
direct
question
from
her
counsel,
she
replied
that
she
did
