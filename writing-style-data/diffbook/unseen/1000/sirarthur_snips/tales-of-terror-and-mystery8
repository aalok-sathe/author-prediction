of
fir
trees.
His
knowledge
was
greater
than
his
wisdom,
and
his
powers
were
far
superior
to
his
character.
The
small
bright
eyes,
buried
deeply
in
his
fleshy
face,
twinkled
with
intelligence
and
an
unabated
curiosity
of
life,
but
they
were
the
eyes
of
a
sensualist
and
an
egotist.
Enough
of
the
man,
for
he
is
dead
now,
poor
devil,
dead
at
the
very
time
that
he
had
made
sure
that
he
had
at
last
discovered
the
elixir
of
life.
It
is
not
with
his
complex
character
that
I
have
to
deal,
but
with
the
very
strange
and
inexplicable
incident
which
had
its
rise
in
my
visit
to
him
in
the
early
spring
of
the
year
'82.
I
had
known
Dacre
in
England,
for
my
researches
in
the
Assyrian
Room
of
the
British
Museum
had
been
conducted
at
the
time
when
he
was
endeavouring
to
establish
a
mystic
and
esoteric
meaning
in
the
Babylonian
tablets,
and
this
community
of
interests
had
brought
us
together.
Chance
remarks
had
led
to
daily
conversation,
and
that
to
something
verging
upon
friendship.
I
had
promised
him
that
on
my
next
visit
to
Paris
I
would
call
upon
him.
At
the
time
when
I
was
able
to
fulfil
my
compact
I
was
living
in
a
cottage
at
Fontainebleau,
and
as
the
evening
trains
were
inconvenient,
he
asked
me
to
spend
the
night
in
his
house.
"I
have
only
that
one
spare
couch,"
said
he,
pointing
to
a
broad
sofa
in
his
large
salon;
"I
hope
that
you
will
manage
to
be
comfortable
there."
It
was
a
singular
bedroom,
with
its
high
walls
of
brown
volumes,
but
there
could
be
no
more
agreeable
furniture
to
a
bookworm
like
myself,
and
there
is
no
scent
so
pleasant
to
my
nostrils
as
that
faint,
subtle
reek
which
comes
from
an
ancient
book.
I
assured
him
that
I
could
desire
no
more
charming
chamber,
and
no
more
congenial
surroundings.
"If
the
fittings
are
neither
convenient
nor
conventional,
they
are
at
least
costly,"
said
he,
looking
round
at
his
shelves.
"I
have
expended
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
money
upon
these
objects
which
surround
you.
Books,
weapons,
gems,
carvings,
tapestries,
images
there
is
hardly
a
thing
here
which
has
not
its
history,
and
it
is
generally
one
worth
telling."
He
was
seated
as
he
spoke
at
one
side
of
the
open
fire
place,
and
I
at
the
other.
His
reading
table
was
on
his
right,
and
the
strong
lamp
above
it
ringed
it
with
a
very
vivid
circle
of
golden
light.
A
half
rolled
palimpsest
lay
in
the
centre,
and
around
it
were
many
quaint
articles
of
bric
a
brac.
One
of
these
was
a
large
funnel,
such
as
is
used
for
filling
wine
casks.
It
appeared
to
be
made
of
black
wood,
and
to
be
rimmed
with
discoloured
brass.
"That
is
a
curious
thing,"
I
remarked.
"What
is
the
history
of
that?"
"Ah!"
said
he,
"it
is
the
very
question
which
I
have
had
occasion
to
ask
myself.
I
would
give
a
good
deal
to
know.
Take
it
in
your
hands
and
examine
it."
I
did
so,
and
found
that
what
I
had
imagined
to
be
wood
was
in
reality
leather,
though
age
had
dried
it
into
an
extreme
hardness.
It
was
a
large
funnel,
and
might
hold
a
quart
when
full.
The
brass
rim
encircled
the
wide
end,
but
the
narrow
was
also
tipped
with
metal.
"What
do
you
make
of
it?"
asked
Dacre.
"I
should
imagine
that
it
belonged
to
some
vintner
or
maltster
in
the
Middle
Ages,"
said
I.
"I
have
seen
in
England
leathern
drinking
flagons
of
the
seventeenth
century
'black
jacks'
as
they
were
called
which
were
of
the
same
colour
and
hardness
as
this
filler."
"I
dare
say
the
date
would
be
about
the
same,"
said
Dacre,
"and,
no
doubt,
also,
it
was
used
for
filling
a
vessel
with
liquid.
If
my
suspicions
are
correct,
however,
it
was
a
queer
vintner
who
used
it,
and
a
very
singular
cask
which
was
filled.
Do
you
observe
nothing
strange
at
the
spout
end
of
the
funnel."
As
I
held
it
to
the
light
I
observed
that
at
a
spot
some
five
inches
above
the
brass
tip
the
narrow
neck
of
the
leather
funnel
was
all
haggled
and
scored,
as
if
someone
had
notched
it
round
with
a
blunt
knife.
Only
at
that
point
was
there
any
roughening
of
the
dead
black
surface.
"Someone
has
tried
to
cut
off
the
neck."
"Would
you
call
it
a
cut?"
"It
is
torn
and
lacerated.
It
must
have
taken
some
strength
to
leave
these
marks
on
such
tough
material,
whatever
the
instrument
may
have
been.
But
what
do
you
think
of
it?
I
can
tell
that
you
know
more
than
you
say."
Dacre
smiled,
and
his
little
eyes
twinkled
with
knowledge.
"Have
you
included
the
psychology
of
dreams
among
your
learned
studies?"
he
asked.
"I
did
not
even
know
that
there
was
such
a
psychology."
"My
dear
sir,
that
shelf
above
the
gem
case
is
filled
with
volumes,
from
Albertus
Magnus
onward,
which
deal
with
no
other
subject.
It
is
a
science
in
itself."
"A
science
of
charlatans!"
"The
charlatan
is
always
the
pioneer.
From
the
astrologer
came
the
astronomer,
from
the
alchemist
the
chemist,
from
the
mesmerist
the
experimental
psychologist.
The
quack
of
yesterday
is
the
professor
of
tomorrow.
Even
such
subtle
and
elusive
things
as
dreams
will
in
time
be
reduced
to
system
and
order.
When
that
time
comes
the
researches
of
our
friends
on
the
bookshelf
yonder
will
no
longer
be
the
amusement
of
the
mystic,
but
the
foundations
of
a
science."
"Supposing
that
is
so,
what
has
the
science
of
dreams
to
do
with
a
large,
black,
brass
rimmed
funnel?"
"I
will
tell
you.
You
know
that
I
have
an
agent
who
is
always
on
the
look
out
for
rarities
and
curiosities
for
my
collection.
Some
days
ago
he
heard
of
a
dealer
upon
one
of
the
Quais
who
had
acquired
some
old
