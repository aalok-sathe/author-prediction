rise
to
the
idea.
Then,
again,
if
not
poison,
what
had
caused
the
man's
death,
since
there
was
neither
wound
nor
marks
of
strangulation?
But,
on
the
other
hand,
whose
blood
was
that
which
lay
so
thickly
upon
the
floor?
There
were
no
signs
of
a
struggle,
nor
had
the
victim
any
weapon
with
which
he
might
have
wounded
an
antagonist.
As
long
as
all
these
questions
were
unsolved,
I
felt
that
sleep
would
be
no
easy
matter,
either
for
Holmes
or
myself.
His
quiet
self
confident
manner
convinced
me
that
he
had
already
formed
a
theory
which
explained
all
the
facts,
though
what
it
was
I
could
not
for
an
instant
conjecture.
He
was
very
late
in
returning
so
late,
that
I
knew
that
the
concert
could
not
have
detained
him
all
the
time.
Dinner
was
on
the
table
before
he
appeared.
"It
was
magnificent,"
he
said,
as
he
took
his
seat.
"Do
you
remember
what
Darwin
says
about
music?
He
claims
that
the
power
of
producing
and
appreciating
it
existed
among
the
human
race
long
before
the
power
of
speech
was
arrived
at.
Perhaps
that
is
why
we
are
so
subtly
influenced
by
it.
There
are
vague
memories
in
our
souls
of
those
misty
centuries
when
the
world
was
in
its
childhood."
"That's
rather
a
broad
idea,"
I
remarked.
"One's
ideas
must
be
as
broad
as
Nature
if
they
are
to
interpret
Nature,"
he
answered.
"What's
the
matter?
You're
not
looking
quite
yourself.
This
Brixton
Road
affair
has
upset
you."
"To
tell
the
truth,
it
has,"
I
said.
"I
ought
to
be
more
case
hardened
after
my
Afghan
experiences.
I
saw
my
own
comrades
hacked
to
pieces
at
Maiwand
without
losing
my
nerve."
"I
can
understand.
There
is
a
mystery
about
this
which
stimulates
the
imagination;
where
there
is
no
imagination
there
is
no
horror.
Have
you
seen
the
evening
paper?"
"No."
"It
gives
a
fairly
good
account
of
the
affair.
It
does
not
mention
the
fact
that
when
the
man
was
raised
up,
a
woman's
wedding
ring
fell
upon
the
floor.
It
is
just
as
well
it
does
not."
"Why?"
"Look
at
this
advertisement,"
he
answered.
"I
had
one
sent
to
every
paper
this
morning
immediately
after
the
affair."
He
threw
the
paper
across
to
me
and
I
glanced
at
the
place
indicated.
It
was
the
first
announcement
in
the
"Found"
column.
"In
Brixton
Road,
this
morning,"
it
ran,
"a
plain
gold
wedding
ring,
found
in
the
roadway
between
the
'White
Hart'
Tavern
and
Holland
Grove.
Apply
Dr.
Watson,
221B,
Baker
Street,
between
eight
and
nine
this
evening."
"Excuse
my
using
your
name,"
he
said.
"If
I
used
my
own
some
of
these
dunderheads
would
recognize
it,
and
want
to
meddle
in
the
affair."
"That
is
all
right,"
I
answered.
"But
supposing
anyone
applies,
I
have
no
ring."
"Oh
yes,
you
have,"
said
he,
handing
me
one.
"This
will
do
very
well.
It
is
almost
a
facsimile."
"And
who
do
you
expect
will
answer
this
advertisement."
"Why,
the
man
in
the
brown
coat
our
florid
friend
with
the
square
toes.
If
he
does
not
come
himself
he
will
send
an
accomplice."
"Would
he
not
consider
it
as
too
dangerous?"
"Not
at
all.
If
my
view
of
the
case
is
correct,
and
I
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
is,
this
man
would
rather
risk
anything
than
lose
the
ring.
According
to
my
notion
he
dropped
it
while
stooping
over
Drebber's
body,
and
did
not
miss
it
at
the
time.
After
leaving
the
house
he
discovered
his
loss
and
hurried
back,
but
found
the
police
already
in
possession,
owing
to
his
own
folly
in
leaving
the
candle
burning.
He
had
to
pretend
to
be
drunk
in
order
to
allay
the
suspicions
which
might
have
been
aroused
by
his
appearance
at
the
gate.
Now
put
yourself
in
that
man's
place.
On
thinking
the
matter
over,
it
must
have
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
possible
that
he
had
lost
the
ring
in
the
road
after
leaving
the
house.
What
would
he
do,
then?
He
would
eagerly
look
out
for
the
evening
papers
in
the
hope
of
seeing
it
among
the
articles
found.
His
eye,
of
course,
would
light
upon
this.
He
would
be
overjoyed.
Why
should
he
fear
a
trap?
There
would
be
no
reason
in
his
eyes
why
the
finding
of
the
ring
should
be
connected
with
the
murder.
He
would
come.
He
will
come.
You
shall
see
him
within
an
hour?"
"And
then?"
I
asked.
"Oh,
you
can
leave
me
to
deal
with
him
then.
Have
you
any
arms?"
"I
have
my
old
service
revolver
and
a
few
cartridges."
"You
had
better
clean
it
and
load
it.
He
will
be
a
desperate
man,
and
though
I
shall
take
him
unawares,
it
is
as
well
to
be
ready
for
anything."
I
went
to
my
bedroom
and
followed
his
advice.
When
I
returned
with
the
pistol
the
table
had
been
cleared,
and
Holmes
was
engaged
in
his
favourite
occupation
of
scraping
upon
his
violin.
"The
plot
thickens,"
he
said,
as
I
entered;
"I
have
just
had
an
answer
to
my
American
telegram.
My
view
of
the
case
is
the
correct
one."
"And
that
is?"
I
asked
eagerly.
"My
fiddle
would
be
the
better
for
new
strings,"
he
remarked.
"Put
your
pistol
in
your
pocket.
When
the
fellow
comes
speak
to
him
in
an
ordinary
way.
Leave
the
rest
to
me.
Don't
frighten
him
by
looking
at
him
too
hard."
"It
is
eight
o'clock
now,"
I
said,
glancing
at
my
watch.
"Yes.
He
will
probably
be
here
in
a
few
minutes.
Open
the
door
slightly.
That
will
do.
Now
put
the
key
on
the
inside.
Thank
you!
This
is

queer
old

up
