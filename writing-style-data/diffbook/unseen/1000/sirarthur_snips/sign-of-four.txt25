every
hour
is
of
importance."
"Can
I
do
anything?
I
am
perfectly
fresh
now,
and
quite
ready
for
another
night's
outing."
"No,
we
can
do
nothing.
We
can
only
wait.
If
we
go
ourselves,
the
message
might
come
in
our
absence,
and
delay
be
caused.
You
can
do
what
you
will,
but
I
must
remain
on
guard."
"Then
I
shall
run
over
to
Camberwell
and
call
upon
Mrs.
Cecil
Forrester.
She
asked
me
to,
yesterday."
"On
Mrs.
Cecil
Forrester?"
asked
Holmes,
with
the
twinkle
of
a
smile
in
his
eyes.
"Well,
of
course
Miss
Morstan
too.
They
were
anxious
to
hear
what
happened."
"I
would
not
tell
them
too
much,"
said
Holmes.
"Women
are
never
to
be
entirely
trusted,
not
the
best
of
them."
I
did
not
pause
to
argue
over
this
atrocious
sentiment.
"I
shall
be
back
in
an
hour
or
two,"
I
remarked.
"All
right!
Good
luck!
But,
I
say,
if
you
are
crossing
the
river
you
may
as
well
return
Toby,
for
I
don't
think
it
is
at
all
likely
that
we
shall
have
any
use
for
him
now."
I
took
our
mongrel
accordingly,
and
left
him,
together
with
a
half
sovereign,
at
the
old
naturalist's
in
Pinchin
Lane.
At
Camberwell
I
found
Miss
Morstan
a
little
weary
after
her
night's
adventures,
but
very
eager
to
hear
the
news.
Mrs.
Forrester,
too,
was
full
of
curiosity.
I
told
them
all
that
we
had
done,
suppressing,
however,
the
more
dreadful
parts
of
the
tragedy.
Thus,
although
I
spoke
of
Mr.
Sholto's
death,
I
said
nothing
of
the
exact
manner
and
method
of
it.
With
all
my
omissions,
however,
there
was
enough
to
startle
and
amaze
them.
"It
is
a
romance!"
cried
Mrs.
Forrester.
"An
injured
lady,
half
a
million
in
treasure,
a
black
cannibal,
and
a
wooden
legged
ruffian.
They
take
the
place
of
the
conventional
dragon
or
wicked
earl."
"And
two
knight
errants
to
the
rescue,"
added
Miss
Morstan,
with
a
bright
glance
at
me.
"Why,
Mary,
your
fortune
depends
upon
the
issue
of
this
search.
I
don't
think
that
you
are
nearly
excited
enough.
Just
imagine
what
it
must
be
to
be
so
rich,
and
to
have
the
world
at
your
feet!"
It
sent
a
little
thrill
of
joy
to
my
heart
to
notice
that
she
showed
no
sign
of
elation
at
the
prospect.
On
the
contrary,
she
gave
a
toss
of
her
proud
head,
as
though
the
matter
were
one
in
which
she
took
small
interest.
"It
is
for
Mr.
Thaddeus
Sholto
that
I
am
anxious,"
she
said.
"Nothing
else
is
of
any
consequence;
but
I
think
that
he
has
behaved
most
kindly
and
honorably
throughout.
It
is
our
duty
to
clear
him
of
this
dreadful
and
unfounded
charge."
It
was
evening
before
I
left
Camberwell,
and
quite
dark
by
the
time
I
reached
home.
My
companion's
book
and
pipe
lay
by
his
chair,
but
he
had
disappeared.
I
looked
about
in
the
hope
of
seeing
a
note,
but
there
was
none.
"I
suppose
that
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes
has
gone
out,"
I
said
to
Mrs.
Hudson
as
she
came
up
to
lower
the
blinds.
"No,
sir.
He
has
gone
to
his
room,
sir.
Do
you
know,
sir,"
sinking
her
voice
into
an
impressive
whisper,
"I
am
afraid
for
his
health?"
"Why
so,
Mrs.
Hudson?"
"Well,
he's
that
strange,
sir.
After
you
was
gone
he
walked
and
he
walked,
up
and
down,
and
up
and
down,
until
I
was
weary
of
the
sound
of
his
footstep.
Then
I
heard
him
talking
to
himself
and
muttering,
and
every
time
the
bell
rang
out
he
came
on
the
stairhead,
with
'What
is
that,
Mrs.
Hudson?'
And
now
he
has
slammed
off
to
his
room,
but
I
can
hear
him
walking
away
the
same
as
ever.
I
hope
he's
not
going
to
be
ill,
sir.
I
ventured
to
say
something
to
him
about
cooling
medicine,
but
he
turned
on
me,
sir,
with
such
a
look
that
I
don't
know
how
ever
I
got
out
of
the
room."
"I
don't
think
that
you
have
any
cause
to
be
uneasy,
Mrs.
Hudson,"
I
answered.
"I
have
seen
him
like
this
before.
He
has
some
small
matter
upon
his
mind
which
makes
him
restless."
I
tried
to
speak
lightly
to
our
worthy
landlady,
but
I
was
myself
somewhat
uneasy
when
through
the
long
night
I
still
from
time
to
time
heard
the
dull
sound
of
his
tread,
and
knew
how
his
keen
spirit
was
chafing
against
this
involuntary
inaction.
At
breakfast
time
he
looked
worn
and
haggard,
with
a
little
fleck
of
feverish
color
upon
either
cheek.
"You
are
knocking
yourself
up,
old
man,"
I
remarked.
"I
heard
you
marching
about
in
the
night."
"No,
I
could
not
sleep,"
he
answered.
"This
infernal
problem
is
consuming
me.
It
is
too
much
to
be
balked
by
so
petty
an
obstacle,
when
all
else
had
been
overcome.
I
know
the
men,
the
launch,
everything;
and
yet
I
can
get
no
news.
I
have
set
other
agencies
at
work,
and
used
every
means
at
my
disposal.
The
whole
river
has
been
searched
on
either
side,
but
there
is
no
news,
nor
has
Mrs.
Smith
heard
of
her
husband.
I
shall
come
to
the
conclusion
soon
that
they
have
scuttled
the
craft.
But
there
are
objections
to
that."
"Or
that
Mrs.
Smith
has
put
us
on
a
wrong
scent."
"No,
I
think
that
may
be
dismissed.
I
had
inquiries
made,
and
there
is
a
launch
of
that
description."
"Could
it
have
gone
up
the
river?"
"I
have
considered
that
possibility
too,
and
there
is
a
search
party
who
will
work
up
as
far
as
Richmond.
If
no
news
comes
to
day,
I
shall
start
off
myself
to
morrow,
and
go
for
the
men
rather
than
the
boat.
But
surely,
surely,
we
shall
hear
something."
We
did
not,
however.
Not
a
word
came
to
us
either
from
Wiggins
or
from
the
other
agencies.
There
were
articles
in
most
of
the
papers
upon
the
Norwood
tragedy.
They
