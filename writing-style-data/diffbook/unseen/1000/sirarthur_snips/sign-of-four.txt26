appeared
to
be
rather
hostile
to
the
unfortunate
Thaddeus
Sholto.
No
fresh
details
were
to
be
found,
however,
in
any
of
them,
save
that
an
inquest
was
to
be
held
upon
the
following
day.
I
walked
over
to
Camberwell
in
the
evening
to
report
our
ill
success
to
the
ladies,
and
on
my
return
I
found
Holmes
dejected
and
somewhat
morose.
He
would
hardly
reply
to
my
questions,
and
busied
himself
all
evening
in
an
abstruse
chemical
analysis
which
involved
much
heating
of
retorts
and
distilling
of
vapors,
ending
at
last
in
a
smell
which
fairly
drove
me
out
of
the
apartment.
Up
to
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
I
could
hear
the
clinking
of
his
test
tubes
which
told
me
that
he
was
still
engaged
in
his
malodorous
experiment.
In
the
early
dawn
I
woke
with
a
start,
and
was
surprised
to
find
him
standing
by
my
bedside,
clad
in
a
rude
sailor
dress
with
a
pea
jacket,
and
a
coarse
red
scarf
round
his
neck.
"I
am
off
down
the
river,
Watson,"
said
he.
"I
have
been
turning
it
over
in
my
mind,
and
I
can
see
only
one
way
out
of
it.
It
is
worth
trying,
at
all
events."
"Surely
I
can
come
with
you,
then?"
said
I.
"No;
you
can
be
much
more
useful
if
you
will
remain
here
as
my
representative.
I
am
loath
to
go,
for
it
is
quite
on
the
cards
that
some
message
may
come
during
the
day,
though
Wiggins
was
despondent
about
it
last
night.
I
want
you
to
open
all
notes
and
telegrams,
and
to
act
on
your
own
judgment
if
any
news
should
come.
Can
I
rely
upon
you?"
"Most
certainly."
"I
am
afraid
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
wire
to
me,
for
I
can
hardly
tell
yet
where
I
may
find
myself.
If
I
am
in
luck,
however,
I
may
not
be
gone
so
very
long.
I
shall
have
news
of
some
sort
or
other
before
I
get
back."
I
had
heard
nothing
of
him
by
breakfast
time.
On
opening
the
Standard,
however,
I
found
that
there
was
a
fresh
allusion
to
the
business.
"With
reference
to
the
Upper
Norwood
tragedy,"
it
remarked,
"we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
matter
promises
to
be
even
more
complex
and
mysterious
than
was
originally
supposed.
Fresh
evidence
has
shown
that
it
is
quite
impossible
that
Mr.
Thaddeus
Sholto
could
have
been
in
any
way
concerned
in
the
matter.
He
and
the
housekeeper,
Mrs.
Bernstone,
were
both
released
yesterday
evening.
It
is
believed,
however,
that
the
police
have
a
clue
as
to
the
real
culprits,
and
that
it
is
being
prosecuted
by
Mr.
Athelney
Jones,
of
Scotland
Yard,
with
all
his
well
known
energy
and
sagacity.
Further
arrests
may
be
expected
at
any
moment."
"That
is
satisfactory
so
far
as
it
goes,"
thought
I.
"Friend
Sholto
is
safe,
at
any
rate.
I
wonder
what
the
fresh
clue
may
be;
though
it
seems
to
be
a
stereotyped
form
whenever
the
police
have
made
a
blunder."
I
tossed
the
paper
down
upon
the
table,
but
at
that
moment
my
eye
caught
an
advertisement
in
the
agony
column.
It
ran
in
this
way:
"Lost.
Whereas
Mordecai
Smith,
boatman,
and
his
son,
Jim,
left
Smith's
Wharf
at
or
about
three
o'clock
last
Tuesday
morning
in
the
steam
launch
Aurora,
black
with
two
red
stripes,
funnel
black
with
a
white
band,
the
sum
of
five
pounds
will
be
paid
to
any
one
who
can
give
information
to
Mrs.
Smith,
at
Smith's
Wharf,
or
at
221b
Baker
Street,
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
said
Mordecai
Smith
and
the
launch
Aurora."
This
was
clearly
Holmes's
doing.
The
Baker
Street
address
was
enough
to
prove
that.
It
struck
me
as
rather
ingenious,
because
it
might
be
read
by
the
fugitives
without
their
seeing
in
it
more
than
the
natural
anxiety
of
a
wife
for
her
missing
husband.
It
was
a
long
day.
Every
time
that
a
knock
came
to
the
door,
or
a
sharp
step
passed
in
the
street,
I
imagined
that
it
was
either
Holmes
returning
or
an
answer
to
his
advertisement.
I
tried
to
read,
but
my
thoughts
would
wander
off
to
our
strange
quest
and
to
the
ill
assorted
and
villainous
pair
whom
we
were
pursuing.
Could
there
be,
I
wondered,
some
radical
flaw
in
my
companion's
reasoning.
Might
he
be
suffering
from
some
huge
self
deception?
Was
it
not
possible
that
his
nimble
and
speculative
mind
had
built
up
this
wild
theory
upon
faulty
premises?
I
had
never
known
him
to
be
wrong;
and
yet
the
keenest
reasoner
may
occasionally
be
deceived.
He
was
likely,
I
thought,
to
fall
into
error
through
the
over
refinement
of
his
logic,
his
preference
for
a
subtle
and
bizarre
explanation
when
a
plainer
and
more
commonplace
one
lay
ready
to
his
hand.
Yet,
on
the
other
hand,
I
had
myself
seen
the
evidence,
and
I
had
heard
the
reasons
for
his
deductions.
When
I
looked
back
on
the
long
chain
of
curious
circumstances,
many
of
them
trivial
in
themselves,
but
all
tending
in
the
same
direction,
I
could
not
disguise
from
myself
that
even
if
Holmes's
explanation
were
incorrect
the
true
theory
must
be
equally
outre
and
startling.
At
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
there
was
a
loud
peal
at
the
bell,
an
authoritative
voice
in
the
hall,
and,
to
my
surprise,
no
less
a
person
than
Mr.
Athelney
Jones
was
shown
up
to
me.
Very
different
was
he,
however,
from
the
brusque
and
masterful
professor
of
common
sense
who
had
taken
over
the
case
so
confidently
at
Upper
Norwood.
His
expression
was
downcast,
and
his
bearing
meek
and
even
apologetic.
"Good
day,
sir;
good
day,"
said
he.
"Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes
is
out,
I
understand."
"Yes,
and
I
cannot
be
sure
when
he
will
be
back.
But
perhaps
you
would
care
to
wait.
Take
that
chair
and
try
one
of
these
cigars."
"Thank
you;
I
don't
mind
if
I
do,"
said
he,
mopping
his
face
