disappointed;
and
at
last
I
was
not
disappointed
either
in
the
object
of
my
journey.
A
great
deal
of
very
reasonable,
very
just
displeasure
I
had
to
persuade
away.
But
it
is
done;
we
are
reconciled,
dearer,
much
dearer,
than
ever,
and
no
moment's
uneasiness
can
ever
occur
between
us
again.
Now,
my
dear
madam,
I
will
release
you;
but
I
could
not
conclude
before.
A
thousand
and
a
thousand
thanks
for
all
the
kindness
you
have
ever
shewn
me,
and
ten
thousand
for
the
attentions
your
heart
will
dictate
towards
her.
If
you
think
me
in
a
way
to
be
happier
than
I
deserve,
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion.
Miss
W.
calls
me
the
child
of
good
fortune.
I
hope
she
is
right.
In
one
respect,
my
good
fortune
is
undoubted,
that
of
being
able
to
subscribe
myself,
Your
obliged
and
affectionate
Son,
F.
C.
WESTON
CHURCHILL.
This
letter
must
make
its
way
to
Emma's
feelings.
She
was
obliged,
in
spite
of
her
previous
determination
to
the
contrary,
to
do
it
all
the
justice
that
Mrs.
Weston
foretold.
As
soon
as
she
came
to
her
own
name,
it
was
irresistible;
every
line
relating
to
herself
was
interesting,
and
almost
every
line
agreeable;
and
when
this
charm
ceased,
the
subject
could
still
maintain
itself,
by
the
natural
return
of
her
former
regard
for
the
writer,
and
the
very
strong
attraction
which
any
picture
of
love
must
have
for
her
at
that
moment.
She
never
stopt
till
she
had
gone
through
the
whole;
and
though
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
that
he
had
been
wrong,
yet
he
had
been
less
wrong
than
she
had
supposed
and
he
had
suffered,
and
was
very
sorry
and
he
was
so
grateful
to
Mrs.
Weston,
and
so
much
in
love
with
Miss
Fairfax,
and
she
was
so
happy
herself,
that
there
was
no
being
severe;
and
could
he
have
entered
the
room,
she
must
have
shaken
hands
with
him
as
heartily
as
ever.
She
thought
so
well
of
the
letter,
that
when
Mr.
Knightley
came
again,
she
desired
him
to
read
it.
She
was
sure
of
Mrs.
Weston's
wishing
it
to
be
communicated;
especially
to
one,
who,
like
Mr.
Knightley,
had
seen
so
much
to
blame
in
his
conduct.
"I
shall
be
very
glad
to
look
it
over,"
said
he;
"but
it
seems
long.
I
will
take
it
home
with
me
at
night."
But
that
would
not
do.
Mr.
Weston
was
to
call
in
the
evening,
and
she
must
return
it
by
him.
"I
would
rather
be
talking
to
you,"
he
replied;
"but
as
it
seems
a
matter
of
justice,
it
shall
be
done."
He
began
stopping,
however,
almost
directly
to
say,
"Had
I
been
offered
the
sight
of
one
of
this
gentleman's
letters
to
his
mother
in
law
a
few
months
ago,
Emma,
it
would
not
have
been
taken
with
such
indifference."
He
proceeded
a
little
farther,
reading
to
himself;
and
then,
with
a
smile,
observed,
"Humph!
a
fine
complimentary
opening:
But
it
is
his
way.
One
man's
style
must
not
be
the
rule
of
another's.
We
will
not
be
severe."
"It
will
be
natural
for
me,"
he
added
shortly
afterwards,
"to
speak
my
opinion
aloud
as
I
read.
By
doing
it,
I
shall
feel
that
I
am
near
you.
It
will
not
be
so
great
a
loss
of
time:
but
if
you
dislike
it
"
"Not
at
all.
I
should
wish
it."
Mr.
Knightley
returned
to
his
reading
with
greater
alacrity.
"He
trifles
here,"
said
he,
"as
to
the
temptation.
He
knows
he
is
wrong,
and
has
nothing
rational
to
urge.
Bad.
He
ought
not
to
have
formed
the
engagement.
'His
father's
disposition:'
he
is
unjust,
however,
to
his
father.
Mr.
Weston's
sanguine
temper
was
a
blessing
on
all
his
upright
and
honourable
exertions;
but
Mr.
Weston
earned
every
present
comfort
before
he
endeavoured
to
gain
it.
Very
true;
he
did
not
come
till
Miss
Fairfax
was
here."
"And
I
have
not
forgotten,"
said
Emma,
"how
sure
you
were
that
he
might
have
come
sooner
if
he
would.
You
pass
it
over
very
handsomely
but
you
were
perfectly
right."
"I
was
not
quite
impartial
in
my
judgment,
Emma:
but
yet,
I
think
had
you
not
been
in
the
case
I
should
still
have
distrusted
him."
When
he
came
to
Miss
Woodhouse,
he
was
obliged
to
read
the
whole
of
it
aloud
all
that
related
to
her,
with
a
smile;
a
look;
a
shake
of
the
head;
a
word
or
two
of
assent,
or
disapprobation;
or
merely
of
love,
as
the
subject
required;
concluding,
however,
seriously,
and,
after
steady
reflection,
thus
"Very
bad
though
it
might
have
been
worse.
Playing
a
most
dangerous
game.
Too
much
indebted
to
the
event
for
his
acquittal.
No
judge
of
his
own
manners
by
you.
Always
deceived
in
fact
by
his
own
wishes,
and
regardless
of
little
besides
his
own
convenience.
Fancying
you
to
have
fathomed
his
secret.
Natural
enough!
his
own
mind
full
of
intrigue,
that
he
should
suspect
it
in
others.
Mystery;
Finesse
how
they
pervert
the
understanding!
My
Emma,
does
not
every
thing
serve
to
prove
more
and
more
the
beauty
of
truth
and
sincerity
in
all
our
dealings
with
each
other?"
Emma
agreed
to
it,
and
with
a
blush
of
sensibility
on
Harriet's
account,
which
she
could
not
give
any
sincere
explanation
of.
"You
had
better
go
on,"
said
she.
He
did
so,
but
very
soon
stopt
again
to
say,
"the
pianoforte!
Ah!
That
was
the
act
of
a
very,
very
young
man,
one
too
young
to
consider
whether
the
inconvenience
of
it
might
not
very
much
exceed
the
pleasure.
A
boyish
scheme,
indeed!
I
cannot
comprehend
a
man's
wishing
to
give
a
woman
any
proof
of
affection
which
he
knows
she
would
rather
dispense
with;
and
he
did
know
that
she
would
have
prevented
the
instrument's
coming
if
she
could."
After
this,
he
made
some
progress
without
any
pause.
Frank
Churchill's
confession
of
having
behaved
shamefully
was
the
first
thing
to
