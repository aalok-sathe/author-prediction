to
defer
this
ceremonious
call
till
a
little
time
had
passed,
and
Mr.
Churchill
could
be
reconciled
to
the
engagement's
becoming
known;
as,
considering
every
thing,
she
thought
such
a
visit
could
not
be
paid
without
leading
to
reports:
but
Mr.
Weston
had
thought
differently;
he
was
extremely
anxious
to
shew
his
approbation
to
Miss
Fairfax
and
her
family,
and
did
not
conceive
that
any
suspicion
could
be
excited
by
it;
or
if
it
were,
that
it
would
be
of
any
consequence;
for
"such
things,"
he
observed,
"always
got
about."
Emma
smiled,
and
felt
that
Mr.
Weston
had
very
good
reason
for
saying
so.
They
had
gone,
in
short
and
very
great
had
been
the
evident
distress
and
confusion
of
the
lady.
She
had
hardly
been
able
to
speak
a
word,
and
every
look
and
action
had
shewn
how
deeply
she
was
suffering
from
consciousness.
The
quiet,
heart
felt
satisfaction
of
the
old
lady,
and
the
rapturous
delight
of
her
daughter
who
proved
even
too
joyous
to
talk
as
usual,
had
been
a
gratifying,
yet
almost
an
affecting,
scene.
They
were
both
so
truly
respectable
in
their
happiness,
so
disinterested
in
every
sensation;
thought
so
much
of
Jane;
so
much
of
every
body,
and
so
little
of
themselves,
that
every
kindly
feeling
was
at
work
for
them.
Miss
Fairfax's
recent
illness
had
offered
a
fair
plea
for
Mrs.
Weston
to
invite
her
to
an
airing;
she
had
drawn
back
and
declined
at
first,
but,
on
being
pressed
had
yielded;
and,
in
the
course
of
their
drive,
Mrs.
Weston
had,
by
gentle
encouragement,
overcome
so
much
of
her
embarrassment,
as
to
bring
her
to
converse
on
the
important
subject.
Apologies
for
her
seemingly
ungracious
silence
in
their
first
reception,
and
the
warmest
expressions
of
the
gratitude
she
was
always
feeling
towards
herself
and
Mr.
Weston,
must
necessarily
open
the
cause;
but
when
these
effusions
were
put
by,
they
had
talked
a
good
deal
of
the
present
and
of
the
future
state
of
the
engagement.
Mrs.
Weston
was
convinced
that
such
conversation
must
be
the
greatest
relief
to
her
companion,
pent
up
within
her
own
mind
as
every
thing
had
so
long
been,
and
was
very
much
pleased
with
all
that
she
had
said
on
the
subject.
"On
the
misery
of
what
she
had
suffered,
during
the
concealment
of
so
many
months,"
continued
Mrs.
Weston,
"she
was
energetic.
This
was
one
of
her
expressions.
'I
will
not
say,
that
since
I
entered
into
the
engagement
I
have
not
had
some
happy
moments;
but
I
can
say,
that
I
have
never
known
the
blessing
of
one
tranquil
hour:'
and
the
quivering
lip,
Emma,
which
uttered
it,
was
an
attestation
that
I
felt
at
my
heart."
"Poor
girl!"
said
Emma.
"She
thinks
herself
wrong,
then,
for
having
consented
to
a
private
engagement?"
"Wrong!
No
one,
I
believe,
can
blame
her
more
than
she
is
disposed
to
blame
herself.
'The
consequence,'
said
she,
'has
been
a
state
of
perpetual
suffering
to
me;
and
so
it
ought.
But
after
all
the
punishment
that
misconduct
can
bring,
it
is
still
not
less
misconduct.
Pain
is
no
expiation.
I
never
can
be
blameless.
I
have
been
acting
contrary
to
all
my
sense
of
right;
and
the
fortunate
turn
that
every
thing
has
taken,
and
the
kindness
I
am
now
receiving,
is
what
my
conscience
tells
me
ought
not
to
be.'
'Do
not
imagine,
madam,'
she
continued,
'that
I
was
taught
wrong.
Do
not
let
any
reflection
fall
on
the
principles
or
the
care
of
the
friends
who
brought
me
up.
The
error
has
been
all
my
own;
and
I
do
assure
you
that,
with
all
the
excuse
that
present
circumstances
may
appear
to
give,
I
shall
yet
dread
making
the
story
known
to
Colonel
Campbell.'"
"Poor
girl!"
said
Emma
again.
"She
loves
him
then
excessively,
I
suppose.
It
must
have
been
from
attachment
only,
that
she
could
be
led
to
form
the
engagement.
Her
affection
must
have
overpowered
her
judgment."
"Yes,
I
have
no
doubt
of
her
being
extremely
attached
to
him."
"I
am
afraid,"
returned
Emma,
sighing,
"that
I
must
often
have
contributed
to
make
her
unhappy."
"On
your
side,
my
love,
it
was
very
innocently
done.
But
she
probably
had
something
of
that
in
her
thoughts,
when
alluding
to
the
misunderstandings
which
he
had
given
us
hints
of
before.
One
natural
consequence
of
the
evil
she
had
involved
herself
in,"
she
said,
"was
that
of
making
her
unreasonable.
The
consciousness
of
having
done
amiss,
had
exposed
her
to
a
thousand
inquietudes,
and
made
her
captious
and
irritable
to
a
degree
that
must
have
been
that
had
been
hard
for
him
to
bear.
'I
did
not
make
the
allowances,'
said
she,
'which
I
ought
to
have
done,
for
his
temper
and
spirits
his
delightful
spirits,
and
that
gaiety,
that
playfulness
of
disposition,
which,
under
any
other
circumstances,
would,
I
am
sure,
have
been
as
constantly
bewitching
to
me,
as
they
were
at
first.'
She
then
began
to
speak
of
you,
and
of
the
great
kindness
you
had
shewn
her
during
her
illness;
and
with
a
blush
which
shewed
me
how
it
was
all
connected,
desired
me,
whenever
I
had
an
opportunity,
to
thank
you
I
could
not
thank
you
too
much
for
every
wish
and
every
endeavour
to
do
her
good.
She
was
sensible
that
you
had
never
received
any
proper
acknowledgment
from
herself."
"If
I
did
not
know
her
to
be
happy
now,"
said
Emma,
seriously,
"which,
in
spite
of
every
little
drawback
from
her
scrupulous
conscience,
she
must
be,
I
could
not
bear
these
thanks;
for,
oh!
Mrs.
Weston,
if
there
were
an
account
drawn
up
of
the
evil
and
the
good
I
have
done
Miss
Fairfax!
Well
(checking
herself,
and
trying
to
be
more
lively),
this
is
all
to
be
forgotten.
You
are
very
kind
to
bring
me
these
interesting
particulars.
They
shew
her
to
the
greatest
advantage.
I
am
sure
she
is
very
good
I
hope
she
will
be
very
happy.
It
is
