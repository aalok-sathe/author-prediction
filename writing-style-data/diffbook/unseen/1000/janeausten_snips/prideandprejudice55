of
the
fair
performer's
countenance.
Elizabeth
saw
what
he
was
doing,
and
at
the
first
convenient
pause,
turned
to
him
with
an
arch
smile,
and
said:
"You
mean
to
frighten
me,
Mr.
Darcy,
by
coming
in
all
this
state
to
hear
me?
I
will
not
be
alarmed
though
your
sister
does
play
so
well.
There
is
a
stubbornness
about
me
that
never
can
bear
to
be
frightened
at
the
will
of
others.
My
courage
always
rises
at
every
attempt
to
intimidate
me."
"I
shall
not
say
you
are
mistaken,"
he
replied,
"because
you
could
not
really
believe
me
to
entertain
any
design
of
alarming
you;
and
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
long
enough
to
know
that
you
find
great
enjoyment
in
occasionally
professing
opinions
which
in
fact
are
not
your
own."
Elizabeth
laughed
heartily
at
this
picture
of
herself,
and
said
to
Colonel
Fitzwilliam,
"Your
cousin
will
give
you
a
very
pretty
notion
of
me,
and
teach
you
not
to
believe
a
word
I
say.
I
am
particularly
unlucky
in
meeting
with
a
person
so
able
to
expose
my
real
character,
in
a
part
of
the
world
where
I
had
hoped
to
pass
myself
off
with
some
degree
of
credit.
Indeed,
Mr.
Darcy,
it
is
very
ungenerous
in
you
to
mention
all
that
you
knew
to
my
disadvantage
in
Hertfordshire
and,
give
me
leave
to
say,
very
impolitic
too
for
it
is
provoking
me
to
retaliate,
and
such
things
may
come
out
as
will
shock
your
relations
to
hear."
"I
am
not
afraid
of
you,"
said
he,
smilingly.
"Pray
let
me
hear
what
you
have
to
accuse
him
of,"
cried
Colonel
Fitzwilliam.
"I
should
like
to
know
how
he
behaves
among
strangers."
"You
shall
hear
then
but
prepare
yourself
for
something
very
dreadful.
The
first
time
of
my
ever
seeing
him
in
Hertfordshire,
you
must
know,
was
at
a
ball
and
at
this
ball,
what
do
you
think
he
did?
He
danced
only
four
dances,
though
gentlemen
were
scarce;
and,
to
my
certain
knowledge,
more
than
one
young
lady
was
sitting
down
in
want
of
a
partner.
Mr.
Darcy,
you
cannot
deny
the
fact."
"I
had
not
at
that
time
the
honour
of
knowing
any
lady
in
the
assembly
beyond
my
own
party."
"True;
and
nobody
can
ever
be
introduced
in
a
ball
room.
Well,
Colonel
Fitzwilliam,
what
do
I
play
next?
My
fingers
wait
your
orders."
"Perhaps,"
said
Darcy,
"I
should
have
judged
better,
had
I
sought
an
introduction;
but
I
am
ill
qualified
to
recommend
myself
to
strangers."
"Shall
we
ask
your
cousin
the
reason
of
this?"
said
Elizabeth,
still
addressing
Colonel
Fitzwilliam.
"Shall
we
ask
him
why
a
man
of
sense
and
education,
and
who
has
lived
in
the
world,
is
ill
qualified
to
recommend
himself
to
strangers?"
"I
can
answer
your
question,"
said
Fitzwilliam,
"without
applying
to
him.
It
is
because
he
will
not
give
himself
the
trouble."
"I
certainly
have
not
the
talent
which
some
people
possess,"
said
Darcy,
"of
conversing
easily
with
those
I
have
never
seen
before.
I
cannot
catch
their
tone
of
conversation,
or
appear
interested
in
their
concerns,
as
I
often
see
done."
"My
fingers,"
said
Elizabeth,
"do
not
move
over
this
instrument
in
the
masterly
manner
which
I
see
so
many
women's
do.
They
have
not
the
same
force
or
rapidity,
and
do
not
produce
the
same
expression.
But
then
I
have
always
supposed
it
to
be
my
own
fault
because
I
will
not
take
the
trouble
of
practising.
It
is
not
that
I
do
not
believe
my
fingers
as
capable
as
any
other
woman's
of
superior
execution."
Darcy
smiled
and
said,
"You
are
perfectly
right.
You
have
employed
your
time
much
better.
No
one
admitted
to
the
privilege
of
hearing
you
can
think
anything
wanting.
We
neither
of
us
perform
to
strangers."
Here
they
were
interrupted
by
Lady
Catherine,
who
called
out
to
know
what
they
were
talking
of.
Elizabeth
immediately
began
playing
again.
Lady
Catherine
approached,
and,
after
listening
for
a
few
minutes,
said
to
Darcy:
"Miss
Bennet
would
not
play
at
all
amiss
if
she
practised
more,
and
could
have
the
advantage
of
a
London
master.
She
has
a
very
good
notion
of
fingering,
though
her
taste
is
not
equal
to
Anne's.
Anne
would
have
been
a
delightful
performer,
had
her
health
allowed
her
to
learn."
Elizabeth
looked
at
Darcy
to
see
how
cordially
he
assented
to
his
cousin's
praise;
but
neither
at
that
moment
nor
at
any
other
could
she
discern
any
symptom
of
love;
and
from
the
whole
of
his
behaviour
to
Miss
de
Bourgh
she
derived
this
comfort
for
Miss
Bingley,
that
he
might
have
been
just
as
likely
to
marry
her,
had
she
been
his
relation.
Lady
Catherine
continued
her
remarks
on
Elizabeth's
performance,
mixing
with
them
many
instructions
on
execution
and
taste.
Elizabeth
received
them
with
all
the
forbearance
of
civility,
and,
at
the
request
of
the
gentlemen,
remained
at
the
instrument
till
her
ladyship's
carriage
was
ready
to
take
them
all
home.
Elizabeth
was
sitting
by
herself
the
next
morning,
and
writing
to
Jane
while
Mrs.
Collins
and
Maria
were
gone
on
business
into
the
village,
when
she
was
startled
by
a
ring
at
the
door,
the
certain
signal
of
a
visitor.
As
she
had
heard
no
carriage,
she
thought
it
not
unlikely
to
be
Lady
Catherine,
and
under
that
apprehension
was
putting
away
her
half
finished
letter
that
she
might
escape
all
impertinent
questions,
when
the
door
opened,
and,
to
her
very
great
surprise,
Mr.
Darcy,
and
Mr.
Darcy
only,
entered
the
room.
He
seemed
astonished
too
on
finding
her
alone,
and
apologised
for
his
intrusion
by
letting
her
know
that
he
had
understood
all
the
ladies
were
to
be
within.
They
then
sat
down,
and
when
her
inquiries
after
Rosings
were
made,
seemed
in
danger
of
sinking
into
total
silence.
It
was
absolutely
necessary,
therefore,
to
think
of
something,
and
in
this
emergence
recollecting
when
she
had
seen
him
last
in
Hertfordshire,
and
feeling
curious
to
