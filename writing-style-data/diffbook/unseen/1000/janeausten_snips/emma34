service
to
her,
or
else
it
is
to
be
attributed
to
an
excellent
embrocation
of
Mr.
Wingfield's,
which
we
have
been
applying
at
times
ever
since
August."
"It
is
not
very
likely,
my
dear,
that
bathing
should
have
been
of
use
to
her
and
if
I
had
known
you
were
wanting
an
embrocation,
I
would
have
spoken
to
"You
seem
to
me
to
have
forgotten
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates,"
said
Emma,
"I
have
not
heard
one
inquiry
after
them."
"Oh!
the
good
Bateses
I
am
quite
ashamed
of
myself
but
you
mention
them
in
most
of
your
letters.
I
hope
they
are
quite
well.
Good
old
Mrs.
Bates
I
will
call
upon
her
to
morrow,
and
take
my
children.
They
are
always
so
pleased
to
see
my
children.
And
that
excellent
Miss
Bates!
such
thorough
worthy
people!
How
are
they,
sir?"
"Why,
pretty
well,
my
dear,
upon
the
whole.
But
poor
Mrs.
Bates
had
a
bad
cold
about
a
month
ago."
"How
sorry
I
am!
But
colds
were
never
so
prevalent
as
they
have
been
this
autumn.
Mr.
Wingfield
told
me
that
he
has
never
known
them
more
general
or
heavy
except
when
it
has
been
quite
an
influenza."
"That
has
been
a
good
deal
the
case,
my
dear;
but
not
to
the
degree
you
mention.
Perry
says
that
colds
have
been
very
general,
but
not
so
heavy
as
he
has
very
often
known
them
in
November.
Perry
does
not
call
it
altogether
a
sickly
season."
"No,
I
do
not
know
that
Mr.
Wingfield
considers
it
very
sickly
except
"Ah!
my
poor
dear
child,
the
truth
is,
that
in
London
it
is
always
a
sickly
season.
Nobody
is
healthy
in
London,
nobody
can
be.
It
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
have
you
forced
to
live
there!
so
far
off!
and
the
air
so
bad!"
"No,
indeed
we
are
not
at
all
in
a
bad
air.
Our
part
of
London
is
very
superior
to
most
others!
You
must
not
confound
us
with
London
in
general,
my
dear
sir.
The
neighbourhood
of
Brunswick
Square
is
very
different
from
almost
all
the
rest.
We
are
so
very
airy!
I
should
be
unwilling,
I
own,
to
live
in
any
other
part
of
the
town;
there
is
hardly
any
other
that
I
could
be
satisfied
to
have
my
children
in:
but
we
are
so
remarkably
airy!
Mr.
Wingfield
thinks
the
vicinity
of
Brunswick
Square
decidedly
the
most
favourable
as
to
air."
"Ah!
my
dear,
it
is
not
like
Hartfield.
You
make
the
best
of
it
but
after
you
have
been
a
week
at
Hartfield,
you
are
all
of
you
different
creatures;
you
do
not
look
like
the
same.
Now
I
cannot
say,
that
I
think
you
are
any
of
you
looking
well
at
present."
"I
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
so,
sir;
but
I
assure
you,
excepting
those
little
nervous
head
aches
and
palpitations
which
I
am
never
entirely
free
from
anywhere,
I
am
quite
well
myself;
and
if
the
children
were
rather
pale
before
they
went
to
bed,
it
was
only
because
they
were
a
little
more
tired
than
usual,
from
their
journey
and
the
happiness
of
coming.
I
hope
you
will
think
better
of
their
looks
to
morrow;
for
I
assure
you
Mr.
Wingfield
told
me,
that
he
did
not
believe
he
had
ever
sent
us
off
altogether,
in
such
good
case.
I
trust,
at
least,
that
you
do
not
think
Mr.
Knightley
looking
ill,"
turning
her
eyes
with
affectionate
anxiety
towards
her
husband.
"Middling,
my
dear;
I
cannot
compliment
you.
I
think
Mr.
John
Knightley
very
far
from
looking
well."
"What
is
the
matter,
sir?
Did
you
speak
to
me?"
cried
Mr.
John
Knightley,
hearing
his
own
name.
"I
am
sorry
to
find,
my
love,
that
my
father
does
not
think
you
looking
well
but
I
hope
it
is
only
from
being
a
little
fatigued.
I
could
have
wished,
however,
as
you
know,
that
you
had
seen
Mr.
Wingfield
before
you
left
home."
"My
dear
Isabella,"
exclaimed
he
hastily
"pray
do
not
concern
yourself
about
my
looks.
Be
satisfied
with
doctoring
and
coddling
yourself
and
the
children,
and
let
me
look
as
I
chuse."
"I
did
not
thoroughly
understand
what
you
were
telling
your
brother,"
cried
Emma,
"about
your
friend
Mr.
Graham's
intending
to
have
a
bailiff
from
Scotland,
to
look
after
his
new
estate.
What
will
it
answer?
Will
not
the
old
prejudice
be
too
strong?"
And
she
talked
in
this
way
so
long
and
successfully
that,
when
forced
to
give
her
attention
again
to
her
father
and
sister,
she
had
nothing
worse
to
hear
than
Isabella's
kind
inquiry
after
Jane
Fairfax;
and
Jane
Fairfax,
though
no
great
favourite
with
her
in
general,
she
was
at
that
moment
very
happy
to
assist
in
praising.
"That
sweet,
amiable
Jane
Fairfax!"
said
Mrs.
John
Knightley.
"It
is
so
long
since
I
have
seen
her,
except
now
and
then
for
a
moment
accidentally
in
town!
What
happiness
it
must
be
to
her
good
old
grandmother
and
excellent
aunt,
when
she
comes
to
visit
them!
I
always
regret
excessively
on
dear
Emma's
account
that
she
cannot
be
more
at
Highbury;
but
now
their
daughter
is
married,
I
suppose
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
will
not
be
able
to
part
with
her
at
all.
She
would
be
such
a
delightful
companion
for
Emma."
Mr.
Woodhouse
agreed
to
it
all,
but
added,
"Our
little
friend
Harriet
Smith,
however,
is
just
such
another
pretty
kind
of
young
person.
You
will
like
Harriet.
Emma
could
not
have
a
better
companion
than
Harriet."
"I
am
most
happy
to
hear
it
but
only
Jane
Fairfax
one
knows
to
be
so
very
accomplished
and
superior!
and
exactly
Emma's
age."
This
topic
was
discussed
very
happily,
and
others
succeeded
of
similar
moment,
and
passed
away
with
similar
harmony;
but
the
evening
did
not
close
without
a
little
return
of
agitation.
The
gruel
came
and
supplied
a
great
deal
to
be
said
much
praise
and
many
comments
undoubting
decision
of
its
wholesomeness
for
every
