washed
by
a
stream,
of
which
the
Abbey,
with
all
the
old
neglect
of
prospect,
had
scarcely
a
sight
and
its
abundance
of
timber
in
rows
and
avenues,
which
neither
fashion
nor
extravagance
had
rooted
up.
The
house
was
larger
than
Hartfield,
and
totally
unlike
it,
covering
a
good
deal
of
ground,
rambling
and
irregular,
with
many
comfortable,
and
one
or
two
handsome
rooms.
It
was
just
what
it
ought
to
be,
and
it
looked
what
it
was
and
Emma
felt
an
increasing
respect
for
it,
as
the
residence
of
a
family
of
such
true
gentility,
untainted
in
blood
and
understanding.
Some
faults
of
temper
John
Knightley
had;
but
Isabella
had
connected
herself
unexceptionably.
She
had
given
them
neither
men,
nor
names,
nor
places,
that
could
raise
a
blush.
These
were
pleasant
feelings,
and
she
walked
about
and
indulged
them
till
it
was
necessary
to
do
as
the
others
did,
and
collect
round
the
strawberry
beds.
The
whole
party
were
assembled,
excepting
Frank
Churchill,
who
was
expected
every
moment
from
Richmond;
and
Mrs.
Elton,
in
all
her
apparatus
of
happiness,
her
large
bonnet
and
her
basket,
was
very
ready
to
lead
the
way
in
gathering,
accepting,
or
talking
strawberries,
and
only
strawberries,
could
now
be
thought
or
spoken
of.
"The
best
fruit
in
England
every
body's
favourite
always
wholesome.
These
the
finest
beds
and
finest
sorts.
Delightful
to
gather

one's
self
the
only
way
of
really
enjoying
them.

shade."
Such,
for
half
an
hour,
was
the
conversation
interrupted
only
once
by
Mrs.
Weston,
who
came
out,
in
her
solicitude
after
her
son
in
law,
to
inquire
if
he
were
come
and
she
was
a
little
uneasy.
She
had
some
fears
of
his
horse.
Seats
tolerably
in
the
shade
were
found;
and
now
Emma
was
obliged
to
overhear
what
Mrs.
Elton
and
Jane
Fairfax
were
talking
of.
A
situation,
a
most
desirable
situation,
was
in
question.
Mrs.
Elton
had
received
notice
of
it
that
morning,
and
was
in
raptures.
It
was
not
with
Mrs.
Suckling,
it
was
not
with
Mrs.
Bragge,
but
in
felicity
and
splendour
it
fell
short
only
of
them:
it
was
with
a
cousin
of
Mrs.
Bragge,
an
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Suckling,
a
lady
known
at
Maple
Grove.
Delightful,
charming,
superior,
first
circles,
spheres,
lines,
ranks,
every
thing
and
Mrs.
Elton
was
wild
to
have
the
offer
closed
with
immediately.
On
her
side,
all
was
warmth,
energy,
and
triumph
and
she
positively
refused
to
take
her
friend's
negative,
though
Miss
Fairfax
continued
to
assure
her
that
she
would
not
at
present
engage
in
any
thing,
repeating
the
same
motives
which
she
had
been
heard
to
urge
before.
Still
Mrs.
Elton
insisted
on
being
authorised
to
write
an
acquiescence
by
the
morrow's
post.
How
Jane
could
bear
it
at
all,
was
astonishing
to
Emma.
She
did
look
vexed,
she
did
speak
pointedly
and
at
last,
with
a
decision
of
action
unusual
to
her,
proposed
a
removal.
"Should
not
they
walk?
Would
not
Mr.
Knightley
shew
them
the
gardens
all
the
gardens?
She
wished
to
see
the
whole
extent."
The
pertinacity
of
her
friend
seemed
more
than
she
could
bear.
It
was
hot;
and
after
walking
some
time
over
the
gardens
in
a
scattered,
dispersed
way,
scarcely
any
three
together,
they
insensibly
followed
one
another
to
the
delicious
shade
of
a
broad
short
avenue
of
limes,
which
stretching
beyond
the
garden
at
an
equal
distance
from
the
river,
seemed
the
finish
of
the
pleasure
grounds.
It
led
to
nothing;
nothing
but
a
view
at
the
end
over
a
low
stone
wall
with
high
pillars,
which
seemed
intended,
in
their
erection,
to
give
the
appearance
of
an
approach
to
the
house,
which
never
had
been
there.
Disputable,
however,
as
might
be
the
taste
of
such
a
termination,
it
was
in
itself
a
charming
walk,
and
the
view
which
closed
it
extremely
pretty.
The
considerable
slope,
at
nearly
the
foot
of
which
the
Abbey
stood,
gradually
acquired
a
steeper
form
beyond
its
grounds;
and
at
half
a
mile
distant
was
a
bank
of
considerable
abruptness
and
grandeur,
well
clothed
with
wood;
and
at
the
bottom
of
this
bank,
favourably
placed
and
sheltered,
rose
the
Abbey
Mill
Farm,
with
meadows
in
front,
and
the
river
making
a
close
and
handsome
curve
around
it.
It
was
a
sweet
view
sweet
to
the
eye
and
the
mind.
English
verdure,
English
culture,
English
comfort,
seen
under
a
sun
bright,
without
being
oppressive.
In
this
walk
Emma
and
Mr.
Weston
found
all
the
others
assembled;
and
towards
this
view
she
immediately
perceived
Mr.
Knightley
and
Harriet
distinct
from
the
rest,
quietly
leading
the
way.
Mr.
Knightley
and
Harriet!
It
was
an
odd
tete
a
tete;
but
she
was
glad
to
see
it.
There
had
been
a
time
when
he
would
have
scorned
her
as
a
companion,
and
turned
from
her
with
little
ceremony.
Now
they
seemed
in
pleasant
conversation.
There
had
been
a
time
also
when
Emma
would
have
been
sorry
to
see
Harriet
in
a
spot
so
favourable
for
the
Abbey
Mill
Farm;
but
now
she
feared
it
not.
It
might
be
safely
viewed
with
all
its
appendages
of
prosperity
and
beauty,
its
rich
pastures,
spreading
flocks,
orchard
in
blossom,
and
light
column
of
smoke
ascending.
She
joined
them
at
the
wall,
and
found
them
more
engaged
in
talking
than
in
looking
around.
He
was
giving
Harriet
information
as
to
modes
of
agriculture,
etc.
