thing.
There
it
goes,
and
there
is
an
end,
thank
Heaven!
of
Mr.
Elton."
"And
when,"
thought
Emma,
"will
there
be
a
beginning
of
Mr.
Churchill?"
She
had
soon
afterwards
reason
to
believe
that
the
beginning
was
already
made,
and
could
not
but
hope
that
the
gipsy,
though
she
had
told
no
fortune,
might
be
proved
to
have
made
Harriet's.
About
a
fortnight
after
the
alarm,
they
came
to
a
sufficient
explanation,
and
quite
undesignedly.
Emma
was
not
thinking
of
it
at
the
moment,
which
made
the
information
she
received
more
valuable.
She
merely
said,
in
the
course
of
some
trivial
chat,
"Well,
Harriet,
whenever
you
marry
I
would
advise
you
to
do
so
and
so"
and
thought
no
more
of
it,
till
after
a
minute's
silence
she
heard
Harriet
say
in
a
very
serious
tone,
"I
shall
never
marry."
Emma
then
looked
up,
and
immediately
saw
how
it
was;
and
after
a
moment's
debate,
as
to
whether
it
should
pass
unnoticed
or
not,
replied,
"Never
marry!
This
is
a
new
resolution."
"It
is
one
that
I
shall
never
change,
however."
After
another
short
hesitation,
"I
hope
it
does
not
proceed
from
I
hope
it
is
not
in
compliment
to
Mr.
Elton?"
"Mr.
Elton
indeed!"
cried
Harriet
indignantly.
"Oh!
no"
and
Emma
could
just
catch
the
words,
"so
superior
to
Mr.
Elton!"
She
then
took
a
longer
time
for
consideration.
Should
she
proceed
no
farther?
should
she
let
it
pass,
and
seem
to
suspect
nothing?
Perhaps
Harriet
might
think
her
cold
or
angry
if
she
did;
or
perhaps
if
she
were
totally
silent,
it
might
only
drive
Harriet
into
asking
her
to
hear
too
much;
and
against
any
thing
like
such
an
unreserve
as
had
been,
such
an
open
and
frequent
discussion
of
hopes
and
chances,
she
was
perfectly
resolved.
She
believed
it
would
be
wiser
for
her
to
say
and
know
at
once,
all
that
she
meant
to
say
and
know.
Plain
dealing
was
always
best.
She
had
previously
determined
how
far
she
would
proceed,
on
any
application
of
the
sort;
and
it
would
be
safer
for
both,
to
have
the
judicious
law
of
her
own
brain
laid
down
with
speed.
She
was
decided,
and
thus
spoke
"Harriet,
I
will
not
affect
to
be
in
doubt
of
your
meaning.
Your
resolution,
or
rather
your
expectation
of
never
marrying,
results
from
an
idea
that
the
person
whom
you
might
prefer,
would
be
too
greatly
your
superior
in
situation
to
think
of
you.
Is
not
it
so?"
"Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
believe
me
I
have
not
the
presumption
to
suppose
Indeed
I
am
not
so
mad.
But
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
admire
him
at
a
distance
and
to
think
of
his
infinite
superiority
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world,
with
the
gratitude,
wonder,
and
veneration,
which
are
so
proper,
in
me
especially."
"I
am
not
at
all
surprized
at
you,
Harriet.
The
service
he
rendered
you
was
enough
to
warm
your
heart."
"Service!
oh!
it
was
such
an
inexpressible
obligation!
The
very
recollection
of
it,
and
all
that
I
felt
at
the
time
when
I
saw
him
coming
his
noble
look
and
my
wretchedness
before.
Such
a
change!
In
one
moment
such
a
change!
From
perfect
misery
to
perfect
happiness!"
"It
is
very
natural.
It
is
natural,
and
it
is
honourable.
Yes,
honourable,
I
think,
to
chuse
so
well
and
so
gratefully.
But
that
it
will
be
a
fortunate
preference
is
more
than
I
can
promise.
I
do
not
advise
you
to
give
way
to
it,
Harriet.
I
do
not
by
any
means
engage
for
its
being
returned.
Consider
what
you
are
about.
Perhaps
it
will
be
wisest
in
you
to
check
your
feelings
while
you
can:
at
any
rate
do
not
let
them
carry
you
far,
unless
you
are
persuaded
of
his
liking
you.
Be
observant
of
him.
Let
his
behaviour
be
the
guide
of
your
sensations.
I
give
you
this
caution
now,
because
I
shall
never
speak
to
you
again
on
the
subject.
I
am
determined
against
all
interference.
Henceforward
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter.
Let
no
name
ever
pass
our
lips.
We
were
very
wrong
before;
we
will
be
cautious
now.
He
is
your
superior,
no
doubt,
and
there
do
seem
objections
and
obstacles
of
a
very
serious
nature;
but
yet,
Harriet,
more
wonderful
things
have
taken
place,
there
have
been
matches
of
greater
disparity.
But
take
care
of
yourself.
I
would
not
have
you
too
sanguine;
though,
however
it
may
end,
be
assured
your
raising
your
thoughts
to
him,
is
a
mark
of
good
taste
which
I
shall
always
know
how
to
value."
Harriet
kissed
her
hand
in
silent
and
submissive
gratitude.
Emma
was
very
decided
in
thinking
such
an
attachment
no
bad
thing
for
her
friend.
Its
tendency
would
be
to
raise
and
refine
her
mind
and
it
must
be
saving
her
from
the
danger
of
degradation.
In
this
state
of
schemes,
and
hopes,
and
connivance,
June
opened
upon
Hartfield.
To
Highbury
in
general
it
brought
no
material
change.
The
Eltons
were
still
talking
of
a
visit
from
the
Sucklings,
and
of
the
use
to
be
made
of
their
barouche
landau;
and
Jane
Fairfax
was
still
at
her
grandmother's;
and
as
the
return
of
the
Campbells
from
Ireland
was
again
delayed,
and
August,
instead
of
Midsummer,
fixed
for
it,
she
was
likely
to
remain
there
full
two
months
longer,
provided
at
least
she
were
able
to
defeat
Mrs.
Elton's
activity
in
her
service,
and
save
herself
from
being
hurried
into
a
delightful
situation
against
her
will.
Mr.
Knightley,
who,
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself,
had
certainly
taken
an
early
dislike
to
Frank
Churchill,
was
only
growing
to
dislike
him
more.
He
began
to
suspect
him
of
some
double
dealing
in
his
pursuit
of
Emma.
That
Emma
was
his
object
appeared
indisputable.
Every
thing
declared
it;
his
own
attentions,
his
father's
hints,
his
mother
in
law's
guarded
silence;
it
was
all
in
unison;
words,
conduct,
discretion,
and
indiscretion,
told
the
same
