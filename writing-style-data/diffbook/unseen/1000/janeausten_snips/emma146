myself
liable
to.
My
behaviour
to
Miss
Woodhouse
indicated,
I
believe,
more
than
it
ought.
In
order
to
assist
a
concealment
so
essential
to
me,
I
was
led
on
to
make
more
than
an
allowable
use
of
the
sort
of
intimacy
into
which
we
were
immediately
thrown.
I
cannot
deny
that
Miss
Woodhouse
was
my
ostensible
object
but
I
am
sure
you
will
believe
the
declaration,
that
had
I
not
been
convinced
of
her
indifference,
I
would
not
have
been
induced
by
any
selfish
views
to
go
on.
Amiable
and
delightful
as
Miss
Woodhouse
is,
she
never
gave
me
the
idea
of
a
young
woman
likely
to
be
attached;
and
that
she
was
perfectly
free
from
any
tendency
to
being
attached
to
me,
was
as
much
my
conviction
as
my
wish.
She
received
my
attentions
with
an
easy,
friendly,
goodhumoured
playfulness,
which
exactly
suited
me.
We
seemed
to
understand
each
other.
From
our
relative
situation,
those
attentions
were
her
due,
and
were
felt
to
be
so.
Whether
Miss
Woodhouse
began
really
to
understand
me
before
the
expiration
of
that
fortnight,
I
cannot
say;
when
I
called
to
take
leave
of
her,
I
remember
that
I
was
within
a
moment
of
confessing
the
truth,
and
I
then
fancied
she
was
not
without
suspicion;
but
I
have
no
doubt
of
her
having
since
detected
me,
at
least
in
some
degree.
She
may
not
have
surmised
the
whole,
but
her
quickness
must
have
penetrated
a
part.
I
cannot
doubt
it.
You
will
find,
whenever
the
subject
becomes
freed
from
its
present
restraints,
that
it
did
not
take
her
wholly
by
surprize.
She
frequently
gave
me
hints
of
it.
I
remember
her
telling
me
at
the
ball,
that
I
owed
Mrs.
Elton
gratitude
for
her
attentions
to
Miss
Fairfax.
I
hope
this
history
of
my
conduct
towards
her
will
be
admitted
by
you
and
my
father
as
great
extenuation
of
what
you
saw
amiss.
While
you
considered
me
as
having
sinned
against
Emma
Woodhouse,
I
could
deserve
nothing
from
either.
Acquit
me
here,
and
procure
for
me,
when
it
is
allowable,
the
acquittal
and
good
wishes
of
that
said
Emma
Woodhouse,
whom
I
regard
with
so
much
brotherly
affection,
as
to
long
to
have
her
as
deeply
and
as
happily
in
love
as
myself.
Whatever
strange
things
I
said
or
did
during
that
fortnight,
you
have
now
a
key
to.
My
heart
was
in
Highbury,
and
my
business
was
to
get
my
body
thither
as
often
as
might
be,
and
with
the
least
suspicion.
If
you
remember
any
queernesses,
set
them
all
to
the
right
account.
Of
the
pianoforte
so
much
talked
of,
I
feel
it
only
necessary
to
say,
that
its
being
ordered
was
absolutely
unknown
to
Miss
F
,
who
would
never
have
allowed
me
to
send
it,
had
any
choice
been
given
her.
The
delicacy
of
her
mind
throughout
the
whole
engagement,
my
dear
madam,
is
much
beyond
my
power
of
doing
justice
to.
You
will
soon,
I
earnestly
hope,
know
her
thoroughly
yourself.
No
description
can
describe
her.
She
must
tell
you
herself
what
she
is
yet
not
by
word,
for
never
was
there
a
human
creature
who
would
so
designedly
suppress
her
own
merit.
Since
I
began
this
letter,
which
will
be
longer
than
I
foresaw,
I
have
heard
from
her.
She
gives
a
good
account
of
her
own
health;
but
as
she
never
complains,
I
dare
not
depend.
I
want
to
have
your
opinion
of
her
looks.
I
know
you
will
soon
call
on
her;
she
is
living
in
dread
of
the
visit.
Perhaps
it
is
paid
already.
Let
me
hear
from
you
without
delay;
I
am
impatient
for
a
thousand
particulars.
Remember
how
few
minutes
I
was
at
Randalls,
and
in
how
bewildered,
how
mad
a
state:
and
I
am
not
much
better
yet;
still
insane
either
from
happiness
or
misery.
When
I
think
of
the
kindness
and
favour
I
have
met
with,
of
her
excellence
and
patience,
and
my
uncle's
generosity,
I
am
mad
with
joy:
but
when
I
recollect
all
the
uneasiness
I
occasioned
her,
and
how
little
I
deserve
to
be
forgiven,
I
am
mad
with
anger.
If
I
could
but
see
her
again!
But
I
must
not
propose
it
yet.
My
uncle
has
been
too
good
for
me
to
encroach.
I
must
still
add
to
this
long
letter.
You
have
not
heard
all
that
you
ought
to
hear.
I
could
not
give
any
connected
detail
yesterday;
but
the
suddenness,
and,
in
one
light,
the
unseasonableness
with
which
the
affair
burst
out,
needs
explanation;
for
though
the
event
of
the
26th
ult.,
as
you
will
conclude,
immediately
opened
to
me
the
happiest
prospects,
I
should
not
have
presumed
on
such
early
measures,
but
from
the
very
particular
circumstances,
which
left
me
not
an
hour
to
lose.
I
should
myself
have
shrunk
from
any
thing
so
hasty,
and
she
would
have
felt
every
scruple
of
mine
with
multiplied
strength
and
refinement.
But
I
had
no
choice.
The
hasty
engagement
she
had
entered
into
with
that
woman
Here,
my
dear
madam,
I
was
obliged
to
leave
off
abruptly,
to
recollect
and
compose
myself.
I
have
been
walking
over
the
country,
and
am
now,
I
hope,
rational
enough
to
make
the
rest
of
my
letter
what
it
ought
to
be.
It
is,
in
fact,
a
most
mortifying
retrospect
for
me.
I
behaved
shamefully.
And
here
I
can
admit,
that
my
manners
to
Miss
W.,
in
being
unpleasant
to
Miss
F.,
were
highly
blameable.
She
disapproved
them,
which
ought
to
have
been
enough.
My
plea
of
concealing
the
truth
she
did
not
think
sufficient.
She
was
displeased;
I
thought
unreasonably
so:
I
thought
her,
on
a
thousand
occasions,
unnecessarily
scrupulous
and
cautious:
I
thought
her
even
cold.
But
she
was
always
right.
If
I
had
followed
her
judgment,
and
subdued
my
spirits
to
the
level
of
what
she
deemed
proper,
I
should
have
escaped
the
greatest
unhappiness
I
have
ever
known.
We
quarrelled.
Do
you
remember
the
morning
