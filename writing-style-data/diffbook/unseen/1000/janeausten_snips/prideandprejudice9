connections.
Their
lodgings
were
not
long
a
secret,
and
at
length
they
began
to
know
the
officers
themselves.
Mr.
Phillips
visited
them
all,
and
this
opened
to
his
nieces
a
store
of
felicity
unknown
before.
They
could
talk
of
nothing
but
officers;
and
Mr.
Bingley's
large
fortune,
the
mention
of
which
gave
animation
to
their
mother,
was
worthless
in
their
eyes
when
opposed
to
the
regimentals
of
an
ensign.
After
listening
one
morning
to
their
effusions
on
this
subject,
Mr.
Bennet
coolly
observed:
"From
all
that
I
can
collect
by
your
manner
of
talking,
you
must
be
two
of
the
silliest
girls
in
the
country.
I
have
suspected
it
some
time,
but
I
am
now
convinced."
Catherine
was
disconcerted,
and
made
no
answer;
but
Lydia,
with
perfect
indifference,
continued
to
express
her
admiration
of
Captain
Carter,
and
her
hope
of
seeing
him
in
the
course
of
the
day,
as
he
was
going
the
next
morning
to
London.
"I
am
astonished,
my
dear,"
said
Mrs.
Bennet,
"that
you
should
be
so
ready
to
think
your
own
children
silly.
If
I
wished
to
think
slightingly
of
anybody's
children,
it
should
not
be
of
my
own,
however."
"If
my
children
are
silly,
I
must
hope
to
be
always
sensible
of
it."
"Yes
but
as
it
happens,
they
are
all
of
them
very
clever."
"This
is
the
only
point,
I
flatter
myself,
on
which
we
do
not
agree.
I
had
hoped
that
our
sentiments
coincided
in
every
particular,
but
I
must
so
far
differ
from
you
as
to
think
our
two
youngest
daughters
uncommonly
foolish."
"My
dear
Mr.
Bennet,
you
must
not
expect
such
girls
to
have
the
sense
of
their
father
and
mother.
When
they
get
to
our
age,
I
dare
say
they
will
not
think
about
officers
any
more
than
we
do.
I
remember
the
time
when
I
liked
a
red
coat
myself
very
well
and,
indeed,
so
I
do
still
at
my
heart;
and
if
a
smart
young
colonel,
with
five
or
six
thousand
a
year,
should
want
one
of
my
girls
I
shall
not
say
nay
to
him;
and
I
thought
Colonel
Forster
looked
very
becoming
the
other
night
at
Sir
William's
in
his
regimentals."
"Mamma,"
cried
Lydia,
"my
aunt
says
that
Colonel
Forster
and
Captain
Carter
do
not
go
so
often
to
Miss
Watson's
as
they
did
when
they
first
came;
she
sees
them
now
very
often
standing
in
Clarke's
library."
Mrs.
Bennet
was
prevented
replying
by
the
entrance
of
the
footman
with
a
note
for
Miss
Bennet;
it
came
from
Netherfield,
and
the
servant
waited
for
an
answer.
Mrs.
Bennet's
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure,
and
she
was
eagerly
calling
out,
while
her
daughter
read,
"Well,
Jane,
who
is
it
from?
What
is
it
about?
What
does
he
say?
Well,
Jane,
make
haste
and
tell
us;
make
haste,
my
love."
"It
is
from
Miss
Bingley,"
said
Jane,
and
then
read
it
aloud.
"MY
DEAR
FRIEND,
"If
you
are
not
so
compassionate
as
to
dine
to
day
with
Louisa
and
me,
we
shall
be
in
danger
of
hating
each
other
for
the
rest
of
our
lives,
for
a
whole
day's
tete
a
tete
between
two
women
can
never
end
without
a
quarrel.
Come
as
soon
as
you
can
on
receipt
of
this.
My
brother
and
the
gentlemen
are
to
dine
with
the
officers.
Yours
ever,
"CAROLINE
BINGLEY"
"With
the
officers!"
cried
Lydia.
"I
wonder
my
aunt
did
not
tell
us
of
that."
"Dining
out,"
said
Mrs.
Bennet,
"that
is
very
unlucky."
"Can
I
have
the
carriage?"
said
Jane.
"No,
my
dear,
you
had
better
go
on
horseback,
because
it
seems
likely
to
rain;
and
then
you
must
stay
all
night."
"That
would
be
a
good
scheme,"
said
Elizabeth,
"if
you
were
sure
that
they
would
not
offer
to
send
her
home."
"Oh!
but
the
gentlemen
will
have
Mr.
Bingley's
chaise
to
go
to
Meryton,
and
the
Hursts
have
no
horses
to
theirs."
"I
had
much
rather
go
in
the
coach."
"But,
my
dear,
your
father
cannot
spare
the
horses,
I
am
sure.
They
are
wanted
in
the
farm,
Mr.
Bennet,
are
they
not?"
"They
are
wanted
in
the
farm
much
oftener
than
I
can
get
them."
"But
if
you
have
got
them
to
day,"
said
Elizabeth,
"my
mother's
purpose
will
be
answered."
She
did
at
last
extort
from
her
father
an
acknowledgment
that
the
horses
were
engaged.
Jane
was
therefore
obliged
to
go
on
horseback,
and
her
mother
attended
her
to
the
door
with
many
cheerful
prognostics
of
a
bad
day.
Her
hopes
were
answered;
Jane
had
not
been
gone
long
before
it
rained
hard.
Her
sisters
were
uneasy
for
her,
but
her
mother
was
delighted.
The
rain
continued
the
whole
evening
without
intermission;
Jane
certainly
could
not
come
back.
"This
was
a
lucky
idea
of
mine,
indeed!"
said
Mrs.
Bennet
more
than
once,
as
if
the
credit
of
making
it
rain
were
all
her
own.
Till
the
next
morning,
however,
she
was
not
aware
of
all
the
felicity
of
her
contrivance.
Breakfast
was
scarcely
over
when
a
servant
from
Netherfield
brought
the
following
note
for
Elizabeth:
"MY
DEAREST
LIZZY,
"I
find
myself
very
unwell
this
morning,
which,
I
suppose,
is
to
be
imputed
to
my
getting
wet
through
yesterday.
My
kind
friends
will
not
hear
of
my
returning
till
I
am
better.
They
insist
also
on
my
seeing
Mr.
Jones
therefore
do
not
be
alarmed
if
you
should
hear
of
his
having
been
to
me
and,
excepting
a
sore
throat
and
headache,
there
is
not
much
the
matter
with
me.
Yours,
etc."
"Well,
my
dear,"
said
Mr.
Bennet,
when
Elizabeth
had
read
the
note
aloud,
"if
your
daughter
should
have
a
dangerous
fit
of
illness
if
she
should
die,
it
would
be
a
comfort
to
know
that
it
was
all
in
pursuit
of
Mr.
Bingley,
and
under
your
orders."
"Oh!
I
am
not
afraid
of
her
dying.
People
do
not
die
of
little
trifling
colds.
She
will
be
taken
good
care
of.
As
long
as
she
stays
there,
it
