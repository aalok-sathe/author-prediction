a
very
agreeable
evening
we
had.
Such
kind
friends,
you
know,
Miss
Woodhouse,
one
must
always
find
agreeable,
though
every
body
seemed
rather
fagged
after
the
morning's
party.
Even
pleasure,
you
know,
is
fatiguing
and
I
cannot
say
that
any
of
them
seemed
very
much
to
have
enjoyed
it.
However,
I
shall
always
think
it
a
very
pleasant
party,
and
feel
extremely
obliged
to
the
kind
friends
who
included
me
in
it."
"Miss
Fairfax,
I
suppose,
though
you
were
not
aware
of
it,
had
been
making
up
her
mind
the
whole
day?"
"I
dare
say
she
had."
"Whenever
the
time
may
come,
it
must
be
unwelcome
to
her
and
all
her
friends
but
I
hope
her
engagement
will
have
every
alleviation
that
is
possible
I
mean,
as
to
the
character
and
manners
of
the
family."
"Thank
you,
dear
Miss
Woodhouse.
Yes,
indeed,
there
is
every
thing
in
the
world
that
can
make
her
happy
in
it.
Except
the
Sucklings
and
Bragges,
there
is
not
such
another
nursery
establishment,
so
liberal
and
elegant,
in
all
Mrs.
Elton's
acquaintance.
Mrs.
Smallridge,
a
most
delightful
woman!
A
style
of
living
almost
equal
to
Maple
Grove
and
as
to
the
children,
except
the
little
Sucklings
and
little
Bragges,
there
are
not
such
elegant
sweet
children
anywhere.
Jane
will
be
treated
with
such
regard
and
kindness!
It
will
be
nothing
but
pleasure,
a
life
of
pleasure.
And
her
salary!
I
really
cannot
venture
to
name
her
salary
to
you,
Miss
Woodhouse.
Even
you,
used
as
you
are
to
great
sums,
would
hardly
believe
that
so
much
could
be
given
to
a
young
person
like
Jane."
"Ah!
madam,"
cried
Emma,
"if
other
children
are
at
all
like
what
I
remember
to
have
been
myself,
I
should
think
five
times
the
amount
of
what
I
have
ever
yet
heard
named
as
a
salary
on
such
occasions,
dearly
earned."
"You
are
so
noble
in
your
ideas!"
"And
when
is
Miss
Fairfax
to
leave
you?"
"Very
soon,
very
soon,
indeed;
that's
the
worst
of
it.
Within
a
fortnight.
Mrs.
Smallridge
is
in
a
great
hurry.
My
poor
mother
does
not
know
how
to
bear
it.
So
then,
I
try
to
put
it
out
of
her
thoughts,
and
say,
Come
ma'am,
do
not
let
us
think
about
it
any
more."
"Her
friends
must
all
be
sorry
to
lose
her;
and
will
not
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
be
sorry
to
find
that
she
has
engaged
herself
before
their
return?"
"Yes;
Jane
says
she
is
sure
they
will;
but
yet,
this
is
such
a
situation
as
she
cannot
feel
herself
justified
in
declining.
I
was
so
astonished
when
she
first
told
me
what
she
had
been
saying
to
Mrs.
Elton,
and
when
Mrs.
Elton
at
the
same
moment
came
congratulating
me
upon
it!
It
was
before
tea
stay
no,
it
could
not
be
before
tea,
because
we
were
just
going
to
cards
and
yet
it
was
before
tea,
because
I
remember
thinking
Oh!
no,
now
I
recollect,
now
I
have
it;
something
happened
before
tea,
but
not
that.
Mr.
Elton
was
called
out
of
the
room
before
tea,
old
John
Abdy's
son
wanted
to
speak
with
him.
Poor
old
John,
I
have
a
great
regard
for
him;
he
was
clerk
to
my
poor
father
twenty
seven
years;
and
now,
poor
old
man,
he
is
bed
ridden,
and
very
poorly
with
the
rheumatic
gout
in
his
joints
I
must
go
and
see
him
to
day;
and
so
will
Jane,
I
am
sure,
if
she
gets
out
at
all.
And
poor
John's
son
came
to
talk
to
Mr.
Elton
about
relief
from
the
parish;
he
is
very
well
to
do
himself,
you
know,
being
head
man
at
the
Crown,
ostler,
and
every
thing
of
that
sort,
but
still
he
cannot
keep
his
father
without
some
help;
and
so,
when
Mr.
Elton
came
back,
he
told
us
what
John
ostler
had
been
telling
him,
and
then
it
came
out
about
the
chaise
having
been
sent
to
Randalls
to
take
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
to
Richmond.
That
was
what
happened
before
tea.
It
was
after
tea
that
Jane
spoke
to
Mrs.
Elton."
Miss
Bates
would
hardly
give
Emma
time
to
say
how
perfectly
new
this
circumstance
was
to
her;
but
as
without
supposing
it
possible
that
she
could
be
ignorant
of
any
of
the
particulars
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill's
going,
she
proceeded
to
give
them
all,
it
was
of
no
consequence.
What
Mr.
Elton
had
learned
from
the
ostler
on
the
subject,
being
the
accumulation
of
the
ostler's
own
knowledge,
and
the
knowledge
of
the
servants
at
Randalls,
was,
that
a
messenger
had
come
over
from
Richmond
soon
after
the
return
of
the
party
from
Box
Hill
which
messenger,
however,
had
been
no
more
than
was
expected;
and
that
Mr.
Churchill
had
sent
his
nephew
a
few
lines,
containing,
upon
the
whole,
a
tolerable
account
of
Mrs.
Churchill,
and
only
wishing
him
not
to
delay
coming
back
beyond
the
next
morning
early;
but
that
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
having
resolved
to
go
home
directly,
without
waiting
at
all,
and
his
horse
seeming
to
have
got
a
cold,
Tom
had
been
sent
off
immediately
for
the
Crown
chaise,
and
the
ostler
had
stood
out
and
seen
it
pass
by,
the
boy
going
a
good
pace,
and
driving
very
steady.
There
was
nothing
in
all
this
either
to
astonish
or
interest,
and
it
caught
Emma's
attention
only
as
it
united
with
the
subject
which
already
engaged
her
mind.
The
contrast
between
Mrs.
Churchill's
importance
in
the
world,
and
Jane
Fairfax's,
struck
her;
one
was
every
thing,
the
other
nothing
and
she
sat
musing
on
the
difference
of
woman's
destiny,
and
quite
unconscious
on
what
her
eyes
were
fixed,
till
roused
by
Miss
Bates's
saying,
"Aye,
I
see
what
you
are
thinking
of,
the
pianoforte.
What
is
to
become
of
that?
Very
true.
Poor
dear
Jane
was
talking
of
it
just
now.
'You
must
go,'
said
she.
'You
and
I
must
part.
You
will
have
no
business
here.
Let
it
stay,
