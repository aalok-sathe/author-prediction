comparing
them,
she
saw
there
was
less
captivating
softness
in
Colonel
Fitzwilliam's
manners,
she
believed
he
might
have
the
best
informed
mind.
But
why
Mr.
Darcy
came
so
often
to
the
Parsonage,
it
was
more
difficult
to
understand.
It
could
not
be
for
society,
as
he
frequently
sat
there
ten
minutes
together
without
opening
his
lips;
and
when
he
did
speak,
it
seemed
the
effect
of
necessity
rather
than
of
choice
a
sacrifice
to
propriety,
not
a
pleasure
to
himself.
He
seldom
appeared
really
animated.
Mrs.
Collins
knew
not
what
to
make
of
him.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam's
occasionally
laughing
at
his
stupidity,
proved
that
he
was
generally
different,
which
her
own
knowledge
of
him
could
not
have
told
her;
and
as
she
would
liked
to
have
believed
this
change
the
effect
of
love,
and
the
object
of
that
love
her
friend
Eliza,
she
set
herself
seriously
to
work
to
find
it
out.
She
watched
him
whenever
they
were
at
Rosings,
and
whenever
he
came
to
Hunsford;
but
without
much
success.
He
certainly
looked
at
her
friend
a
great
deal,
but
the
expression
of
that
look
was
disputable.
It
was
an
earnest,
steadfast
gaze,
but
she
often
doubted
whether
there
were
much
admiration
in
it,
and
sometimes
it
seemed
nothing
but
absence
of
mind.
She
had
once
or
twice
suggested
to
Elizabeth
the
possibility
of
his
being
partial
to
her,
but
Elizabeth
always
laughed
at
the
idea;
and
Mrs.
Collins
did
not
think
it
right
to
press
the
subject,
from
the
danger
of
raising
expectations
which
might
only
end
in
disappointment;
for
in
her
opinion
it
admitted
not
of
a
doubt,
that
all
her
friend's
dislike
would
vanish,
if
she
could
suppose
him
to
be
in
her
power.
In
her
kind
schemes
for
Elizabeth,
she
sometimes
planned
her
marrying
Colonel
Fitzwilliam.
He
was
beyond
comparison
the
most
pleasant
man;
he
certainly
admired
her,
and
his
situation
in
life
was
most
eligible;
but,
to
counterbalance
these
advantages,
Mr.
Darcy
had
considerable
patronage
in
the
church,
and
his
cousin
could
have
none
at
all.
More
than
once
did
Elizabeth,
in
her
ramble
within
the
park,
unexpectedly
meet
Mr.
Darcy.
She
felt
all
the
perverseness
of
the
mischance
that
should
bring
him
where
no
one
else
was
brought,
and,
to
prevent
its
ever
happening
again,
took
care
to
inform
him
at
first
that
it
was
a
favourite
haunt
of
hers.
How
it
could
occur
a
second
time,
therefore,
was
very
odd!
Yet
it
did,
and
even
a
third.
It
seemed
like
wilful
ill
nature,
or
a
voluntary
penance,
for
on
these
occasions
it
was
not
merely
a
few
formal
inquiries
and
an
awkward
pause
and
then
away,
but
he
actually
thought
it
necessary
to
turn
back
and
walk
with
her.
He
never
said
a
great
deal,
nor
did
she
give
herself
the
trouble
of
talking
or
of
listening
much;
but
it
struck
her
in
the
course
of
their
third
rencontre
that
he
was
asking
some
odd
unconnected
questions
about
her
pleasure
in
being
at
Hunsford,
her
love
of
solitary
walks,
and
her
opinion
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Collins's
happiness;
and
that
in
speaking
of
Rosings
and
her
not
perfectly
understanding
the
house,
he
seemed
to
expect
that
whenever
she
came
into
Kent
again
she
would
be
staying
there
too.
His
words
seemed
to
imply
it.
Could
he
have
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
in
his
thoughts?
She
supposed,
if
he
meant
anything,
he
must
mean
an
allusion
to
what
might
arise
in
that
quarter.
It
distressed
her
a
little,
and
she
was
quite
glad
to
find
herself
at
the
gate
in
the
pales
opposite
the
Parsonage.
She
was
engaged
one
day
as
she
walked,
in
perusing
Jane's
last
letter,
and
dwelling
on
some
passages
which
proved
that
Jane
had
not
written
in
spirits,
when,
instead
of
being
again
surprised
by
Mr.
Darcy,
she
saw
on
looking
up
that
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
was
meeting
her.
Putting
away
the
letter
immediately
and
forcing
a
smile,
she
said:
"I
did
not
know
before
that
you
ever
walked
this
way."
"I
have
been
making
the
tour
of
the
park,"
he
replied,
"as
I
generally
do
every
year,
and
intend
to
close
it
with
a
call
at
the
Parsonage.
Are
you
going
much
farther?"
"No,
I
should
have
turned
in
a
moment."
And
accordingly
she
did
turn,
and
they
walked
towards
the
Parsonage
together.
"Do
you
certainly
leave
Kent
on
Saturday?"
said
she.
"Yes
if
Darcy
does
not
put
it
off
again.
But
I
am
at
his
disposal.
He
arranges
the
business
just
as
he
pleases."
"And
if
not
able
to
please
himself
in
the
arrangement,
he
has
at
least
pleasure
in
the
great
power
of
choice.
I
do
not
know
anybody
who
seems
more
to
enjoy
the
power
of
doing
what
he
likes
than
Mr.
Darcy."
"He
likes
to
have
his
own
way
very
well,"
replied
Colonel
Fitzwilliam.
"But
so
we
all
do.
It
is
only
that
he
has
better
means
of
having
it
than
many
others,
because
he
is
rich,
and
many
others
are
poor.
I
speak
feelingly.
A
younger
son,
you
know,
must
be
inured
to
self
denial
and
dependence."
"In
my
opinion,
the
younger
son
of
an
earl
can
know
very
little
of
either.
Now
seriously,
what
have
you
ever
known
of
self
denial
and
dependence?
When
have
you
been
prevented
by
want
of
money
from
going
wherever
you
chose,
or
procuring
anything
you
had
a
fancy
for?"
"These
are
home
questions
and
perhaps
I
cannot
say
that
I
have
experienced
many
hardships
of
that
nature.
But
in
matters
of
greater
weight,
I
may
suffer
from
want
of
money.
Younger
sons
cannot
marry
where
they
like."
"Unless
where
they
like
women
of
fortune,
which
I
think
they
very
often
do."
"Our
habits
of
expense
make
us
too
dependent,
and
there
are
not
many
in
my
rank
of
life
who
can
afford
to
marry
without
some
attention
to
money."
"Is
this,"
thought
Elizabeth,
"meant
for
me?"
and
she
coloured
at
the
idea;
but,
recovering
herself,
said
in
a
lively
tone,
"And
