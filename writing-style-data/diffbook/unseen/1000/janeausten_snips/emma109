Here
is
your
tippet.
Mrs.
Weston
begs
you
to
put
on
your
tippet.
She
says
she
is
afraid
there
will
be
draughts
in
the
passage,
though
every
thing
has
been
done
One
door
nailed
up
Quantities
of
matting
My
dear
Jane,
indeed
you
must.
Mr.
Churchill,
oh!
you
are
too
obliging!
How
well
you
put
it
on!
so
gratified!
Excellent
dancing
indeed!
Yes,
my
dear,
I
ran
home,
as
I
said
I
should,
to
help
grandmama
to
bed,
and
got
back
again,
and
nobody
missed
me.
I
set
off
without
saying
a
word,
just
as
I
told
you.
Grandmama
was
quite
well,
had
a
charming
evening
with
Mr.
Woodhouse,
a
vast
deal
of
chat,
and
backgammon.
Tea
was
made
downstairs,
biscuits
and
baked
apples
and
wine
before
she
came
away:
amazing
luck
in
some
of
her
throws:
and
she
inquired
a
great
deal
about
you,
how
you
were
amused,
and
who
were
your
partners.
'Oh!'
said
I,
'I
shall
not
forestall
Jane;
I
left
her
dancing
with
Mr.
George
Otway;
she
will
love
to
tell
you
all
about
it
herself
to
morrow:
her
first
partner
was
Mr.
Elton,
I
do
not
know
who
will
ask
her
next,
perhaps
Mr.
William
Cox.'
My
dear
sir,
you
are
too
obliging.
Is
there
nobody
you
would
not
rather?
I
am
not
helpless.
Sir,
you
are
most
kind.
Upon
my
word,
Jane
on
one
arm,
and
me
on
the
other!
Stop,
stop,
let
us
stand
a
little
back,
Mrs.
Elton
is
going;
dear
Mrs.
Elton,
how
elegant
she
looks!
Beautiful
lace!
Now
we
all
follow
in
her
train.
Quite
the
queen
of
the
evening!
Well,
here
we
are
at
the
passage.
Two
steps,
Jane,
take
care
of
the
two
steps.
Oh!
no,
there
is
but
one.
Well,
I
was
persuaded
there
were
two.
How
very
odd!
I
was
convinced
there
were
two,
and
there
is
but
one.
I
never
saw
any
thing
equal
to
the
comfort
and
style
Candles
everywhere.
I
was
telling
you
of
your
grandmama,
Jane,
There
was
a
little
disappointment.
The
baked
apples
and
biscuits,
excellent
in
their
way,
you
know;
but
there
was
a
delicate
fricassee
of
sweetbread
and
some
asparagus
brought
in
at
first,
and
good
Mr.
Woodhouse,
not
thinking
the
asparagus
quite
boiled
enough,
sent
it
all
out
again.
Now
there
is
nothing
grandmama
loves
better
than
sweetbread
and
asparagus
so
she
was
rather
disappointed,
but
we
agreed
we
would
not
speak
of
it
to
any
body,
for
fear
of
its
getting
round
to
dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
who
would
be
so
very
much
concerned!
Well,
this
is
brilliant!
I
am
all
amazement!
could
not
have
supposed
any
thing!
Such
elegance
and
profusion!
I
have
seen
nothing
like
it
since
Well,
where
shall
we
sit?
where
shall
we
sit?
Anywhere,
so
that
Jane
is
not
in
a
draught.
Where
I
sit
is
of
no
consequence.
Oh!
do
you
recommend
this
side?
Well,
I
am
sure,
Mr.
Churchill
only
it
seems
too
good
but
just
as
you
please.
What
you
direct
in
this
house
cannot
be
wrong.
Dear
Jane,
how
shall
we
ever
recollect
half
the
dishes
for
grandmama?
Soup
too!
Bless
me!
I
should
not
be
helped
so
soon,
but
it
smells
most
excellent,
and
I
cannot
help
beginning."
Emma
had
no
opportunity
of
speaking
to
Mr.
Knightley
till
after
supper;
but,
when
they
were
all
in
the
ballroom
again,
her
eyes
invited
him
irresistibly
to
come
to
her
and
be
thanked.
He
was
warm
in
his
reprobation
of
Mr.
Elton's
conduct;
it
had
been
unpardonable
rudeness;
and
Mrs.
Elton's
looks
also
received
the
due
share
of
censure.
"They
aimed
at
wounding
more
than
Harriet,"
said
he.
"Emma,
why
is
it
that
they
are
your
enemies?"
He
looked
with
smiling
penetration;
and,
on
receiving
no
answer,
added,
"She
ought
not
to
be
angry
with
you,
I
suspect,
whatever
he
may
be.
To
that
surmise,
you
say
nothing,
of
course;
but
confess,
Emma,
that
you
did
want
him
to
marry
Harriet."
"I
did,"
replied
Emma,
"and
they
cannot
forgive
me."
He
shook
his
head;
but
there
was
a
smile
of
indulgence
with
it,
and
he
only
said,
"I
shall
not
scold
you.
I
leave
you
to
your
own
reflections."
"Can
you
trust
me
with
such
flatterers?
Does
my
vain
spirit
ever
tell
me
I
am
wrong?"
"Not
your
vain
spirit,
but
your
serious
spirit.
If
one
leads
you
wrong,
I
am
sure
the
other
tells
you
of
it."
"I
do
own
myself
to
have
been
completely
mistaken
in
Mr.
Elton.
There
is
a
littleness
about
him
which
you
discovered,
and
which
I
did
not:
and
I
was
fully
convinced
of
his
being
in
love
with
Harriet.
It
was
through
a
series
of
strange
blunders!"
"And,
in
return
for
your
acknowledging
so
much,
I
will
do
you
the
justice
to
say,
that
you
would
have
chosen
for
him
better
than
he
has
chosen
for
himself.
Harriet
Smith
has
some
first
rate
qualities,
which
Mrs.
Elton
is
totally
without.
An
unpretending,
single
minded,
artless
girl
infinitely
to
be
preferred
by
any
man
of
sense
and
taste
to
such
a
woman
as
Mrs.
Elton.
I
found
Harriet
more
conversable
than
I
expected."
Emma
was
extremely
gratified.
They
were
interrupted
by
the
bustle
of
Mr.
Weston
calling
on
every
body
to
begin
dancing
again.
"Come
Miss
Woodhouse,
Miss
Otway,
Miss
Fairfax,
what
are
you
all
doing?
Come
Emma,
set
your
companions
the
example.
Every
body
is
lazy!
Every
body
is
asleep!"
"I
am
ready,"
said
Emma,
"whenever
I
am
wanted."
"Whom
are
you
going
to
dance
with?"
asked
Mr.
Knightley.
She
hesitated
a
moment,
and
then
replied,
"With
you,
if
you
will
ask
me."
"Will
you?"
said
he,
offering
his
hand.
"Indeed
I
will.
You
have
shewn
that
you
can
dance,
and
you
know
we
are
not
really
so
much
brother
and
sister
as
to
make
it
at
all
improper."
"Brother
and
sister!
no,
indeed."
This
little
explanation
with
Mr.
Knightley
gave
Emma
considerable
pleasure.
It
was
one
of
the
agreeable
recollections
of
the
