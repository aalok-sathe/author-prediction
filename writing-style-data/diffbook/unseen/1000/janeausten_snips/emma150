living
constantly
with
her
father,
and
in
no
house
of
his
own,
there
would
be
much,
very
much,
to
be
borne
with.
She
promised
to
think
of
it,
and
advised
him
to
think
of
it
more;
but
he
was
fully
convinced,
that
no
reflection
could
alter
his
wishes
or
his
opinion
on
the
subject.
He
had
given
it,
he
could
assure
her,
very
long
and
calm
consideration;
he
had
been
walking
away
from
William
Larkins
the
whole
morning,
to
have
his
thoughts
to
himself.
"Ah!
there
is
one
difficulty
unprovided
for,"
cried
Emma.
"I
am
sure
William
Larkins
will
not
like
it.
You
must
get
his
consent
before
you
ask
mine."
She
promised,
however,
to
think
of
it;
and
pretty
nearly
promised,
moreover,
to
think
of
it,
with
the
intention
of
finding
it
a
very
good
scheme.
It
is
remarkable,
that
Emma,
in
the
many,
very
many,
points
of
view
in
which
she
was
now
beginning
to
consider
Donwell
Abbey,
was
never
struck
with
any
sense
of
injury
to
her
nephew
Henry,
whose
rights
as
heir
expectant
had
formerly
been
so
tenaciously
regarded.
Think
she
must
of
the
possible
difference
to
the
poor
little
boy;
and
yet
she
only
gave
herself
a
saucy
conscious
smile
about
it,
and
found
amusement
in
detecting
the
real
cause
of
that
violent
dislike
of
Mr.
Knightley's
marrying
Jane
Fairfax,
or
any
body
else,
which
at
the
time
she
had
wholly
imputed
to
the
amiable
solicitude
of
the
sister
and
the
aunt.
This
proposal
of
his,
this
plan
of
marrying
and
continuing
at
Hartfield
the
more
she
contemplated
it,
the
more
pleasing
it
became.
His
evils
seemed
to
lessen,
her
own
advantages
to
increase,
their
mutual
good
to
outweigh
every
drawback.
Such
a
companion
for
herself
in
the
periods
of
anxiety
and
cheerlessness
before
her!
Such
a
partner
in
all
those
duties
and
cares
to
which
time
must
be
giving
increase
of
melancholy!
She
would
have
been
too
happy
but
for
poor
Harriet;
but
every
blessing
of
her
own
seemed
to
involve
and
advance
the
sufferings
of
her
friend,
who
must
now
be
even
excluded
from
Hartfield.
The
delightful
family
party
which
Emma
was
securing
for
herself,
poor
Harriet
must,
in
mere
charitable
caution,
be
kept
at
a
distance
from.
She
would
be
a
loser
in
every
way.
Emma
could
not
deplore
her
future
absence
as
any
deduction
from
her
own
enjoyment.
In
such
a
party,
Harriet
would
be
rather
a
dead
weight
than
otherwise;
but
for
the
poor
girl
herself,
it
seemed
a
peculiarly
cruel
necessity
that
was
to
be
placing
her
in
such
a
state
of
unmerited
punishment.
In
time,
of
course,
Mr.
Knightley
would
be
forgotten,
that
is,
supplanted;
but
this
could
not
be
expected
to
happen
very
early.
Mr.
Knightley
himself
would
be
doing
nothing
to
assist
the
cure;
not
like
Mr.
Elton.
Mr.
Knightley,
always
so
kind,
so
feeling,
so
truly
considerate
for
every
body,
would
never
deserve
to
be
less
worshipped
than
now;
and
it
really
was
too
much
to
hope
even
of
Harriet,
that
she
could
be
in
love
with
more
than
three
men
in
one
year.
It
was
a
very
great
relief
to
Emma
to
find
Harriet
as
desirous
as
herself
to
avoid
a
meeting.
Their
intercourse
was
painful
enough
by
letter.
How
much
worse,
had
they
been
obliged
to
meet!
Harriet
expressed
herself
very
much
as
might
be
supposed,
without
reproaches,
or
apparent
sense
of
ill
usage;
and
yet
Emma
fancied
there
was
a
something
of
resentment,
a
something
bordering
on
it
in
her
style,
which
increased
the
desirableness
of
their
being
separate.
It
might
be
only
her
own
consciousness;
but
it
seemed
as
if
an
angel
only
could
have
been
quite
without
resentment
under
such
a
stroke.
She
had
no
difficulty
in
procuring
Isabella's
invitation;
and
she
was
fortunate
in
having
a
sufficient
reason
for
asking
it,
without
resorting
to
invention.
There
was
a
tooth
amiss.
Harriet
really
wished,
and
had
wished
some
time,
to
consult
a
dentist.
Mrs.
John
Knightley
was
delighted
to
be
of
use;
any
thing
of
ill
health
was
a
recommendation
to
her
and
though
not
so
fond
of
a
dentist
as
of
a
Mr.
Wingfield,
she
was
quite
eager
to
have
Harriet
under
her
care.
When
it
was
thus
settled
on
her
sister's
side,
Emma
proposed
it
to
her
friend,
and
found
her
very
persuadable.
Harriet
was
to
go;
she
was
invited
for
at
least
a
fortnight;
she
was
to
be
conveyed
in
Mr.
Woodhouse's
carriage.
It
was
all
arranged,
it
was
all
completed,
and
Harriet
was
safe
in
Brunswick
Square.
Now
Emma
could,
indeed,
enjoy
Mr.
Knightley's
visits;
now
she
could
talk,
and
she
could
listen
with
true
happiness,
unchecked
by
that
sense
of
injustice,
of
guilt,
of
something
most
painful,
which
had
haunted
her
when
remembering
how
disappointed
a
heart
was
near
her,
how
much
might
at
that
moment,
and
at
a
little
distance,
be
enduring
by
the
feelings
which
she
had
led
astray
herself.
The
difference
of
Harriet
at
Mrs.
Goddard's,
or
in
London,
made
perhaps
an
unreasonable
difference
in
Emma's
sensations;
but
she
could
not
think
of
her
in
London
without
objects
of
curiosity
and
employment,
which
must
be
averting
the
past,
and
carrying
her
out
of
herself.
She
would
not
allow
any
other
anxiety
to
succeed
directly
to
the
place
in
her
mind
which
Harriet
had
occupied.
There
was
a
communication
before
her,
one
which
she
only
could
be
competent
to
make
the
confession
of
her
engagement
to
her
father;
but
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
present.
She
had
resolved
to
defer
the
disclosure
till
Mrs.
Weston
were
safe
and
well.
No
additional
agitation
should
be
thrown
at
this
period
among
those
she
loved
and
the
evil
should
not
act
on
herself
by
anticipation
before
the
appointed
time.
A
fortnight,
at
least,
of
leisure
and
peace
of
mind,
to
crown
every
warmer,
but
more
agitating,
delight,
should
be
hers.
She
soon
resolved,
equally
as
a
duty
and
a
pleasure,
to
employ
