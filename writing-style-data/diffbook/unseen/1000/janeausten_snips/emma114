story.
But
while
so
many
were
devoting
him
to
Emma,
and
Emma
herself
making
him
over
to
Harriet,
Mr.
Knightley
began
to
suspect
him
of
some
inclination
to
trifle
with
Jane
Fairfax.
He
could
not
understand
it;
but
there
were
symptoms
of
intelligence
between
them
he
thought
so
at
least
symptoms
of
admiration
on
his
side,
which,
having
once
observed,
he
could
not
persuade
himself
to
think
entirely
void
of
meaning,
however
he
might
wish
to
escape
any
of
Emma's
errors
of
imagination.
She
was
not
present
when
the
suspicion
first
arose.
He
was
dining
with
the
Randalls
family,
and
Jane,
at
the
Eltons';
and
he
had
seen
a
look,
more
than
a
single
look,
at
Miss
Fairfax,
which,
from
the
admirer
of
Miss
Woodhouse,
seemed
somewhat
out
of
place.
When
he
was
again
in
their
company,
he
could
not
help
remembering
what
he
had
seen;
nor
could
he
avoid
observations
which,
unless
it
were
like
Cowper
and
his
fire
at
twilight,
"Myself
creating
what
I
saw,"
brought
him
yet
stronger
suspicion
of
there
being
a
something
of
private
liking,
of
private
understanding
even,
between
Frank
Churchill
and
Jane.
He
had
walked
up
one
day
after
dinner,
as
he
very
often
did,
to
spend
his
evening
at
Hartfield.
Emma
and
Harriet
were
going
to
walk;
he
joined
them;
and,
on
returning,
they
fell
in
with
a
larger
party,
who,
like
themselves,
judged
it
wisest
to
take
their
exercise
early,
as
the
weather
threatened
rain;
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
and
their
son,
Miss
Bates
and
her
niece,
who
had
accidentally
met.
They
all
united;
and,
on
reaching
Hartfield
gates,
Emma,
who
knew
it
was
exactly
the
sort
of
visiting
that
would
be
welcome
to
her
father,
pressed
them
all
to
go
in
and
drink
tea
with
him.
The
Randalls
party
agreed
to
it
immediately;
and
after
a
pretty
long
speech
from
Miss
Bates,
which
few
persons
listened
to,
she
also
found
it
possible
to
accept
dear
Miss
Woodhouse's
most
obliging
invitation.
As
they
were
turning
into
the
grounds,
Mr.
Perry
passed
by
on
horseback.
The
gentlemen
spoke
of
his
horse.
"By
the
bye,"
said
Frank
Churchill
to
Mrs.
Weston
presently,
"what
became
of
Mr.
Perry's
plan
of
setting
up
his
carriage?"
Mrs.
Weston
looked
surprized,
and
said,
"I
did
not
know
that
he
ever
had
any
such
plan."
"Nay,
I
had
it
from
you.
You
wrote
me
word
of
it
three
months
ago."
"Me!
impossible!"
"Indeed
you
did.
I
remember
it
perfectly.
You
mentioned
it
as
what
was
certainly
to
be
very
soon.
Mrs.
Perry
had
told
somebody,
and
was
extremely
happy
about
it.
It
was
owing
to
her
persuasion,
as
she
thought
his
being
out
in
bad
weather
did
him
a
great
deal
of
harm.
You
must
remember
it
now?"
"Upon
my
word
I
never
heard
of
it
till
this
moment."
"Never!
really,
never!
Bless
me!
how
could
it
be?
Then
I
must
have
dreamt
it
but
I
was
completely
persuaded
Miss
Smith,
you
walk
as
if
you
were
tired.
You
will
not
be
sorry
to
find
yourself
at
home."
"What
is
this?
What
is
this?"
cried
Mr.
Weston,
"about
Perry
and
a
carriage?
Is
Perry
going
to
set
up
his
carriage,
Frank?
I
am
glad
he
can
afford
it.
You
had
it
from
himself,
had
you?"
"No,
sir,"
replied
his
son,
laughing,
"I
seem
to
have
had
it
from
nobody.
Very
odd!
I
really
was
persuaded
of
Mrs.
Weston's
having
mentioned
it
in
one
of
her
letters
to
Enscombe,
many
weeks
ago,
with
all
these
particulars
but
as
she
declares
she
never
heard
a
syllable
of
it
before,
of
course
it
must
have
been
a
dream.
I
am
a
great
dreamer.
I
dream
of
every
body
at
Highbury
when
I
am
away
and
when
I
have
gone
through
my
particular
friends,
then
I
begin
dreaming
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Perry."
"It
is
odd
though,"
observed
his
father,
"that
you
should
have
had
such
a
regular
connected
dream
about
people
whom
it
was
not
very
likely
you
should
be
thinking
of
at
Enscombe.
Perry's
setting
up
his
carriage!
and
his
wife's
persuading
him
to
it,
out
of
care
for
his
health
just
what
will
happen,
I
have
no
doubt,
some
time
or
other;
only
a
little
premature.
What
an
air
of
probability
sometimes
runs
through
a
dream!
And
at
others,
what
a
heap
of
absurdities
it
is!
Well,
Frank,
your
dream
certainly
shews
that
Highbury
is
in
your
thoughts
when
you
are
absent.
Emma,
you
are
a
great
dreamer,
I
think?"
Emma
was
out
of
hearing.
She
had
hurried
on
before
her
guests
to
prepare
her
father
for
their
appearance,
and
was
beyond
the
reach
of
Mr.
Weston's
hint.
"Why,
to
own
the
truth,"
cried
Miss
Bates,
who
had
been
trying
in
vain
to
be
heard
the
last
two
minutes,
"if
I
must
speak
on
this
subject,
there
is
no
denying
that
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
might
have
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
did
not
dream
it
I
am
sure
I
have
sometimes
the
oddest
dreams
in
the
world
but
if
I
am
questioned
about
it,
I
must
acknowledge
that
there
was
such
an
idea
last
spring;
for
Mrs.
Perry
herself
mentioned
it
to
my
mother,
and
the
Coles
knew
of
it
as
well
as
ourselves
but
it
was
quite
a
secret,
known
to
nobody
else,
and
only
thought
of
about
three
days.
Mrs.
Perry
was
very
anxious
that
he
should
have
a
carriage,
and
came
to
my
mother
in
great
spirits
one
morning
because
she
thought
she
had
prevailed.
Jane,
don't
you
remember
grandmama's
telling
us
of
it
when
we
got
home?
I
forget
where
we
had
been
walking
to
very
likely
to
Randalls;
yes,
I
think
it
was
to
Randalls.
Mrs.
Perry
was
always
particularly
fond
of
my
mother
indeed
I
do
not
know
who
is
not
and
she
had
mentioned
it
to
her
in
confidence;
she
had
no
objection
to
her
telling
us,
of
course,
but
it
was
not
to
go
beyond:
and,
from
that
