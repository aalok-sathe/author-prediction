to
have
her
removed
just
now
for
a
time
from
Highbury,
and
indulging
in
one
scheme
more
nearly
resolve,
that
it
might
be
practicable
to
get
an
invitation
for
her
to
Brunswick
Square.
Isabella
had
been
pleased
with
Harriet;
and
a
few
weeks
spent
in
London
must
give
her
some
amusement.
She
did
not
think
it
in
Harriet's
nature
to
escape
being
benefited
by
novelty
and
variety,
by
the
streets,
the
shops,
and
the
children.
At
any
rate,
it
would
be
a
proof
of
attention
and
kindness
in
herself,
from
whom
every
thing
was
due;
a
separation
for
the
present;
an
averting
of
the
evil
day,
when
they
must
all
be
together
again.
She
rose
early,
and
wrote
her
letter
to
Harriet;
an
employment
which
left
her
so
very
serious,
so
nearly
sad,
that
Mr.
Knightley,
in
walking
up
to
Hartfield
to
breakfast,
did
not
arrive
at
all
too
soon;
and
half
an
hour
stolen
afterwards
to
go
over
the
same
ground
again
with
him,
literally
and
figuratively,
was
quite
necessary
to
reinstate
her
in
a
proper
share
of
the
happiness
of
the
evening
before.
He
had
not
left
her
long,
by
no
means
long
enough
for
her
to
have
the
slightest
inclination
for
thinking
of
any
body
else,
when
a
letter
was
brought
her
from
Randalls
a
very
thick
letter;
she
guessed
what
it
must
contain,
and
deprecated
the
necessity
of
reading
it.
She
was
now
in
perfect
charity
with
Frank
Churchill;
she
wanted
no
explanations,
she
wanted
only
to
have
her
thoughts
to
herself
and
as
for
understanding
any
thing
he
wrote,
she
was
sure
she
was
incapable
of
it.
It
must
be
waded
through,
however.
She
opened
the
packet;
it
was
too
surely
so;
a
note
from
Mrs.
Weston
to
herself,
ushered
in
the
letter
from
Frank
to
Mrs.
Weston.
"I
have
the
greatest
pleasure,
my
dear
Emma,
in
forwarding
to
you
the
enclosed.
I
know
what
thorough
justice
you
will
do
it,
and
have
scarcely
a
doubt
of
its
happy
effect.
I
think
we
shall
never
materially
disagree
about
the
writer
again;
but
I
will
not
delay
you
by
a
long
preface.
We
are
quite
well.
This
letter
has
been
the
cure
of
all
the
little
nervousness
I
have
been
feeling
lately.
I
did
not
quite
like
your
looks
on
Tuesday,
but
it
was
an
ungenial
morning;
and
though
you
will
never
own
being
affected
by
weather,
I
think
every
body
feels
a
north
east
wind.
I
felt
for
your
dear
father
very
much
in
the
storm
of
Tuesday
afternoon
and
yesterday
morning,
but
had
the
comfort
of
hearing
last
night,
by
Mr.
Perry,
that
it
had
not
made
him
ill.
"Yours
ever,
"A.
W."
[To
Mrs.
Weston.]
WINDSOR
JULY.
MY
DEAR
MADAM,
"If
I
made
myself
intelligible
yesterday,
this
letter
will
be
expected;
but
expected
or
not,
I
know
it
will
be
read
with
candour
and
indulgence.
You
are
all
goodness,
and
I
believe
there
will
be
need
of
even
all
your
goodness
to
allow
for
some
parts
of
my
past
conduct.
But
I
have
been
forgiven
by
one
who
had
still
more
to
resent.
My
courage
rises
while
I
write.
It
is
very
difficult
for
the
prosperous
to
be
humble.
I
have
already
met
with
such
success
in
two
applications
for
pardon,
that
I
may
be
in
danger
of
thinking
myself
too
sure
of
yours,
and
of
those
among
your
friends
who
have
had
any
ground
of
offence.
You
must
all
endeavour
to
comprehend
the
exact
nature
of
my
situation
when
I
first
arrived
at
Randalls;
you
must
consider
me
as
having
a
secret
which
was
to
be
kept
at
all
hazards.
This
was
the
fact.
My
right
to
place
myself
in
a
situation
requiring
such
concealment,
is
another
question.
I
shall
not
discuss
it
here.
For
my
temptation
to
think
it
a
right,
I
refer
every
caviller
to
a
brick
house,
sashed
windows
below,
and
casements
above,
in
Highbury.
I
dared
not
address
her
openly;
my
difficulties
in
the
then
state
of
Enscombe
must
be
too
well
known
to
require
definition;
and
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
prevail,
before
we
parted
at
Weymouth,
and
to
induce
the
most
upright
female
mind
in
the
creation
to
stoop
in
charity
to
a
secret
engagement.
Had
she
refused,
I
should
have
gone
mad.
But
you
will
be
ready
to
say,
what
was
your
hope
in
doing
this?
What
did
you
look
forward
to?
To
any
thing,
every
thing
to
time,
chance,
circumstance,
slow
effects,
sudden
bursts,
perseverance
and
weariness,
health
and
sickness.
Every
possibility
of
good
was
before
me,
and
the
first
of
blessings
secured,
in
obtaining
her
promises
of
faith
and
correspondence.
If
you
need
farther
explanation,
I
have
the
honour,
my
dear
madam,
of
being
your
husband's
son,
and
the
advantage
of
inheriting
a
disposition
to
hope
for
good,
which
no
inheritance
of
houses
or
lands
can
ever
equal
the
value
of.
See
me,
then,
under
these
circumstances,
arriving
on
my
first
visit
to
Randalls;
and
here
I
am
conscious
of
wrong,
for
that
visit
might
have
been
sooner
paid.
You
will
look
back
and
see
that
I
did
not
come
till
Miss
Fairfax
was
in
Highbury;
and
as
you
were
the
person
slighted,
you
will
forgive
me
instantly;
but
I
must
work
on
my
father's
compassion,
by
reminding
him,
that
so
long
as
I
absented
myself
from
his
house,
so
long
I
lost
the
blessing
of
knowing
you.
My
behaviour,
during
the
very
happy
fortnight
which
I
spent
with
you,
did
not,
I
hope,
lay
me
open
to
reprehension,
excepting
on
one
point.
And
now
I
come
to
the
principal,
the
only
important
part
of
my
conduct
while
belonging
to
you,
which
excites
my
own
anxiety,
or
requires
very
solicitous
explanation.
With
the
greatest
respect,
and
the
warmest
friendship,
do
I
mention
Miss
Woodhouse;
my
father
perhaps
will
think
I
ought
to
add,
with
the
deepest
humiliation.
A
few
words
which
dropped
from
him
yesterday
spoke
his
opinion,
and
some
censure
I
acknowledge
