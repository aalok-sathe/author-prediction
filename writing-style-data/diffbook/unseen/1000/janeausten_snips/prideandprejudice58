pray,
what
is
the
usual
price
of
an
earl's
younger
son?
Unless
the
elder
brother
is
very
sickly,
I
suppose
you
would
not
ask
above
fifty
thousand
pounds."
He
answered
her
in
the
same
style,
and
the
subject
dropped.
To
interrupt
a
silence
which
might
make
him
fancy
her
affected
with
what
had
passed,
she
soon
afterwards
said:
"I
imagine
your
cousin
brought
you
down
with
him
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
having
someone
at
his
disposal.
I
wonder
he
does
not
marry,
to
secure
a
lasting
convenience
of
that
kind.
But,
perhaps,
his
sister
does
as
well
for
the
present,
and,
as
she
is
under
his
sole
care,
he
may
do
what
he
likes
with
her."
"No,"
said
Colonel
Fitzwilliam,
"that
is
an
advantage
which
he
must
divide
with
me.
I
am
joined
with
him
in
the
guardianship
of
Miss
Darcy."
"Are
you
indeed?
And
pray
what
sort
of
guardians
do
you
make?
Does
your
charge
give
you
much
trouble?
Young
ladies
of
her
age
are
sometimes
a
little
difficult
to
manage,
and
if
she
has
the
true
Darcy
spirit,
she
may
like
to
have
her
own
way."
As
she
spoke
she
observed
him
looking
at
her
earnestly;
and
the
manner
in
which
he
immediately
asked
her
why
she
supposed
Miss
Darcy
likely
to
give
them
any
uneasiness,
convinced
her
that
she
had
somehow
or
other
got
pretty
near
the
truth.
She
directly
replied:
"You
need
not
be
frightened.
I
never
heard
any
harm
of
her;
and
I
dare
say
she
is
one
of
the
most
tractable
creatures
in
the
world.
She
is
a
very
great
favourite
with
some
ladies
of
my
acquaintance,
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley.
I
think
I
have
heard
you
say
that
you
know
them."
"I
know
them
a
little.
Their
brother
is
a
pleasant
gentlemanlike
man
he
is
a
great
friend
of
Darcy's."
"Oh!
yes,"
said
Elizabeth
drily;
"Mr.
Darcy
is
uncommonly
kind
to
Mr.
Bingley,
and
takes
a
prodigious
deal
of
care
of
him."
"Care
of
him!
Yes,
I
really
believe
Darcy
does
take
care
of
him
in
those
points
where
he
most
wants
care.
From
something
that
he
told
me
in
our
journey
hither,
I
have
reason
to
think
Bingley
very
much
indebted
to
him.
But
I
ought
to
beg
his
pardon,
for
I
have
no
right
to
suppose
that
Bingley
was
the
person
meant.
It
was
all
conjecture."
"What
is
it
you
mean?"
"It
is
a
circumstance
which
Darcy
could
not
wish
to
be
generally
known,
because
if
it
were
to
get
round
to
the
lady's
family,
it
would
be
an
unpleasant
thing."
"You
may
depend
upon
my
not
mentioning
it."
"And
remember
that
I
have
not
much
reason
for
supposing
it
to
be
Bingley.
What
he
told
me
was
merely
this:
that
he
congratulated
himself
on
having
lately
saved
a
friend
from
the
inconveniences
of
a
most
imprudent
marriage,
but
without
mentioning
names
or
any
other
particulars,
and
I
only
suspected
it
to
be
Bingley
from
believing
him
the
kind
of
young
man
to
get
into
a
scrape
of
that
sort,
and
from
knowing
them
to
have
been
together
the
whole
of
last
summer."
"Did
Mr.
Darcy
give
you
reasons
for
this
interference?"
"I
understood
that
there
were
some
very
strong
objections
against
the
lady."
"And
what
arts
did
he
use
to
separate
them?"
"He
did
not
talk
to
me
of
his
own
arts,"
said
Fitzwilliam,
smiling.
"He
only
told
me
what
I
have
now
told
you."
Elizabeth
made
no
answer,
and
walked
on,
her
heart
swelling
with
indignation.
After
watching
her
a
little,
Fitzwilliam
asked
her
why
she
was
so
thoughtful.
"I
am
thinking
of
what
you
have
been
telling
me,"
said
she.
"Your
cousin's
conduct
does
not
suit
my
feelings.
Why
was
he
to
be
the
judge?"
"You
are
rather
disposed
to
call
his
interference
officious?"
"I
do
not
see
what
right
Mr.
Darcy
had
to
decide
on
the
propriety
of
his
friend's
inclination,
or
why,
upon
his
own
judgement
alone,
he
was
to
determine
and
direct
in
what
manner
his
friend
was
to
be
happy.
But,"
she
continued,
recollecting
herself,
"as
we
know
none
of
the
particulars,
it
is
not
fair
to
condemn
him.
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
there
was
much
affection
in
the
case."
"That
is
not
an
unnatural
surmise,"
said
Fitzwilliam,
"but
it
is
a
lessening
of
the
honour
of
my
cousin's
triumph
very
sadly."
This
was
spoken
jestingly;
but
it
appeared
to
her
so
just
a
picture
of
Mr.
Darcy,
that
she
would
not
trust
herself
with
an
answer,
and
therefore,
abruptly
changing
the
conversation
talked
on
indifferent
matters
until
they
reached
the
Parsonage.
There,
shut
into
her
own
room,
as
soon
as
their
visitor
left
them,
she
could
think
without
interruption
of
all
that
she
had
heard.
It
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
any
other
people
could
be
meant
than
those
with
whom
she
was
connected.
There
could
not
exist
in
the
world
two
men
over
whom
Mr.
Darcy
could
have
such
boundless
influence.
That
he
had
been
concerned
in
the
measures
taken
to
separate
Bingley
and
Jane
she
had
never
doubted;
but
she
had
always
attributed
to
Miss
Bingley
the
principal
design
and
arrangement
of
them.
If
his
own
vanity,
however,
did
not
mislead
him,
he
was
the
cause,
his
pride
and
caprice
were
the
cause,
of
all
that
Jane
had
suffered,
and
still
continued
to
suffer.
He
had
ruined
for
a
while
every
hope
of
happiness
for
the
most
affectionate,
generous
heart
in
the
world;
and
no
one
could
say
how
lasting
an
evil
he
might
have
inflicted.
"There
were
some
very
strong
objections
against
the
lady,"
were
Colonel
Fitzwilliam's
words;
and
those
strong
objections
probably
were,
her
having
one
uncle
who
was
a
country
attorney,
and
another
who
was
in
business
in
London.
"To
Jane
herself,"
she
exclaimed,
"there
could
be
no
possibility
of
objection;
all
loveliness
and
goodness
as
she
is!
her
understanding
excellent,
her
mind
improved,
and
her
manners
captivating.
Neither
could
anything
be
