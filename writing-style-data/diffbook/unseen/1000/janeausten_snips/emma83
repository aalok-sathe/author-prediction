to
be
acted
upon.
May
I
hope
for
the
honour
of
your
hand
for
the
two
first
dances
of
this
little
projected
ball,
to
be
given,
not
at
Randalls,
but
at
the
Crown
Inn?"
"The
Crown!"
"Yes;
if
you
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
see
no
objection,
and
I
trust
you
cannot,
my
father
hopes
his
friends
will
be
so
kind
as
to
visit
him
there.
Better
accommodations,
he
can
promise
them,
and
not
a
less
grateful
welcome
than
at
Randalls.
It
is
his
own
idea.
Mrs.
Weston
sees
no
objection
to
it,
provided
you
are
satisfied.
This
is
what
we
all
feel.
Oh!
you
were
perfectly
right!
Ten
couple,
in
either
of
the
Randalls
rooms,
would
have
been
insufferable!
Dreadful!
I
felt
how
right
you
were
the
whole
time,
but
was
too
anxious
for
securing
any
thing
to
like
to
yield.
Is
not
it
a
good
exchange?
You
consent
I
hope
you
consent?"
"It
appears
to
me
a
plan
that
nobody
can
object
to,
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
do
not.
I
think
it
admirable;
and,
as
far
as
I
can
answer
for
myself,
shall
be
most
happy
It
seems
the
only
improvement
that
could
be.
Papa,
do
you
not
think
it
an
excellent
improvement?"
She
was
obliged
to
repeat
and
explain
it,
before
it
was
fully
comprehended;
and
then,
being
quite
new,
farther
representations
were
necessary
to
make
it
acceptable.
"No;
he
thought
it
very
far
from
an
improvement
a
very
bad
plan
much
worse
than
the
other.
A
room
at
an
inn
was
always
damp
and
dangerous;
never
properly
aired,
or
fit
to
be
inhabited.
If
they
must
dance,
they
had
better
dance
at
Randalls.
He
had
never
been
in
the
room
at
the
Crown
in
his
life
did
not
know
the
people
who
kept
it
by
sight.
Oh!
no
a
very
bad
plan.
They
would
catch
worse
colds
at
the
Crown
than
anywhere."
"I
was
going
to
observe,
sir,"
said
Frank
Churchill,
"that
one
of
the
great
recommendations
of
this
change
would
be
the
very
little
danger
of
any
body's
catching
cold
so
much
less
danger
at
the
Crown
than
at
Randalls!
Mr.
Perry
might
have
reason
to
regret
the
alteration,
but
nobody
else
could."
"Sir,"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse,
rather
warmly,
"you
are
very
much
mistaken
if
you
suppose
Mr.
Perry
to
be
that
sort
of
character.
Mr.
Perry
is
extremely
concerned
when
any
of
us
are
ill.
But
I
do
not
understand
how
the
room
at
the
Crown
can
be
safer
for
you
than
your
father's
house."
"From
the
very
circumstance
of
its
being
larger,
sir.
We
shall
have
no
occasion
to
open
the
windows
at
all
not
once
the
whole
evening;
and
it
is
that
dreadful
habit
of
opening
the
windows,
letting
in
cold
air
upon
heated
bodies,
which
(as
you
well
know,
sir)
does
the
mischief."
"Open
the
windows!
but
surely,
Mr.
Churchill,
nobody
would
think
of
opening
the
windows
at
Randalls.
Nobody
could
be
so
imprudent!
I
never
heard
of
such
a
thing.
Dancing
with
open
windows!
I
am
sure,
neither
your
father
nor
Mrs.
Weston
(poor
Miss
Taylor
that
was)
would
suffer
it."
"Ah!
sir
but
a
thoughtless
young
person
will
sometimes
step
behind
a
window
curtain,
and
throw
up
a
sash,
without
its
being
suspected.
I
have
often
known
it
done
myself."
"Have
you
indeed,
sir?
Bless
me!
I
never
could
have
supposed
it.
But
I
live
out
of
the
world,
and
am
often
astonished
at
what
I
hear.
However,
this
does
make
a
difference;
and,
perhaps,
when
we
come
to
talk
it
over
but
these
sort
of
things
require
a
good
deal
of
consideration.
One
cannot
resolve
upon
them
in
a
hurry.
If
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
will
be
so
obliging
as
to
call
here
one
morning,
we
may
talk
it
over,
and
see
what
can
be
done."
"But,
unfortunately,
sir,
my
time
is
so
limited
"
"Oh!"
interrupted
Emma,
"there
will
be
plenty
of
time
for
talking
every
thing
over.
There
is
no
hurry
at
all.
If
it
can
be
contrived
to
be
at
the
Crown,
papa,
it
will
be
very
convenient
for
the
horses.
They
will
be
so
near
their
own
stable."
"So
they
will,
my
dear.
That
is
a
great
thing.
Not
that
James
ever
complains;
but
it
is
right
to
spare
our
horses
when
we
can.
If
I
could
be
sure
of
the
rooms
being
thoroughly
aired
but
is
Mrs.
Stokes
to
be
trusted?
I
doubt
it.
I
do
not
know
her,
even
by
sight."
"I
can
answer
for
every
thing
of
that
nature,
sir,
because
it
will
be
under
Mrs.
Weston's
care.
Mrs.
Weston
undertakes
to
direct
the
whole."
"There,
papa!
Now
you
must
be
satisfied
Our
own
dear
Mrs.
Weston,
who
is
carefulness
itself.
Do
not
you
remember
what
Mr.
Perry
said,
so
many
years
ago,
when
I
had
the
measles?
'If
Miss
Taylor
undertakes
to
wrap
Miss
Emma
up,
you
need
not
have
any
fears,
sir.'
How
often
have
I
heard
you
speak
of
it
as
such
a
compliment
to
her!"
"Aye,
very
true.
Mr.
Perry
did
say
so.
I
shall
never
forget
it.
Poor
little
Emma!
You
were
very
bad
with
the
measles;
that
is,
you
would
have
been
very
bad,
but
for
Perry's
great
attention.
He
came
four
times
a
day
for
a
week.
He
said,
from
the
first,
it
was
a
very
good
sort
which
was
our
great
comfort;
but
the
measles
are
a
dreadful
complaint.
I
hope
whenever
poor
Isabella's
little
ones
have
the
measles,
she
will
send
for
Perry."
"My
father
and
Mrs.
Weston
are
at
the
Crown
at
this
moment,"
said
Frank
Churchill,
"examining
the
capabilities
of
the
house.
I
left
them
there
and
came
on
to
Hartfield,
impatient
for
your
opinion,
and
hoping
you
might
be
persuaded
to
join
them
and
give
your
advice
on
the
spot.
I
was
desired
to
say
so
from
both.
It
would
be
the
greatest
pleasure
to
them,
if
you
could
allow
me
to
attend
you
there.
They
can
do
nothing
satisfactorily
