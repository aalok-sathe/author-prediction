are
not
often
deficient;
not
often
deficient
either
in
manner
or
comprehension.
I
think
you
understand
me,
therefore."
An
arch
look
expressed
"I
understand
you
well
enough;"
but
she
said
only,
"Miss
Fairfax
is
reserved."
"I
always
told
you
she
was
a
little;
but
you
will
soon
overcome
all
that
part
of
her
reserve
which
ought
to
be
overcome,
all
that
has
its
foundation
in
diffidence.
What
arises
from
discretion
must
be
honoured."
"You
think
her
diffident.
I
do
not
see
it."
"My
dear
Emma,"
said
he,
moving
from
his
chair
into
one
close
by
her,
"you
are
not
going
to
tell
me,
I
hope,
that
you
had
not
a
pleasant
evening."
"Oh!
no;
I
was
pleased
with
my
own
perseverance
in
asking
questions;
and
amused
to
think
how
little
information
I
obtained."
"I
am
disappointed,"
was
his
only
answer.
"I
hope
every
body
had
a
pleasant
evening,"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse,
in
his
quiet
way.
"I
had.
Once,
I
felt
the
fire
rather
too
much;
but
then
I
moved
back
my
chair
a
little,
a
very
little,
and
it
did
not
disturb
me.
Miss
Bates
was
very
chatty
and
good
humoured,
as
she
always
is,
though
she
speaks
rather
too
quick.
However,
she
is
very
agreeable,
and
Mrs.
Bates
too,
in
a
different
way.
I
like
old
friends;
and
Miss
Jane
Fairfax
is
a
very
pretty
sort
of
young
lady,
a
very
pretty
and
a
very
well
behaved
young
lady
indeed.
She
must
have
found
the
evening
agreeable,
Mr.
Knightley,
because
she
had
Emma."
"True,
sir;
and
Emma,
because
she
had
Miss
Fairfax."
Emma
saw
his
anxiety,
and
wishing
to
appease
it,
at
least
for
the
present,
said,
and
with
a
sincerity
which
no
one
could
question
"She
is
a
sort
of
elegant
creature
that
one
cannot
keep
one's
eyes
from.
I
am
always
watching
her
to
admire;
and
I
do
pity
her
from
my
heart."
Mr.
Knightley
looked
as
if
he
were
more
gratified
than
he
cared
to
express;
and
before
he
could
make
any
reply,
Mr.
Woodhouse,
whose
thoughts
were
on
the
Bates's,
said
"It
is
a
great
pity
that
their
circumstances
should
be
so
confined!
a
great
pity
indeed!
and
I
have
often
wished
but
it
is
so
little
one
can
venture
to
do
small,
trifling
presents,
of
any
thing
uncommon
Now
we
have
killed
a
porker,
and
Emma
thinks
of
sending
them
a
loin
or
a
leg;
it
is
very
small
and
delicate
Hartfield
pork
is
not
like
any
other
pork
but
still
it
is
pork
and,
my
dear
Emma,
unless
one
could
be
sure
of
their
making
it
into
steaks,
nicely
fried,
as
ours
are
fried,
without
the
smallest
grease,
and
not
roast
it,
for
no
stomach
can
bear
roast
pork
I
think
we
had
better
send
the
leg
do
not
you
think
so,
my
dear?"
"My
dear
papa,
I
sent
the
whole
hind
quarter.
I
knew
you
would
wish
it.
There
will
be
the
leg
to
be
salted,
you
know,
which
is
so
very
nice,
and
the
loin
to
be
dressed
directly
in
any
manner
they
like."
"That's
right,
my
dear,
very
right.
I
had
not
thought
of
it
before,
but
that
is
the
best
way.
They
must
not
over
salt
the
leg;
and
then,
if
it
is
not
over
salted,
and
if
it
is
very
thoroughly
boiled,
just
as
Serle
boils
ours,
and
eaten
very
moderately
of,
with
a
boiled
turnip,
and
a
little
carrot
or
parsnip,
I
do
not
consider
it
unwholesome."
"Emma,"
said
Mr.
Knightley
presently,
"I
have
a
piece
of
news
for
you.
You
like
news
and
I
heard
an
article
in
my
way
hither
that
I
think
will
interest
you."
"News!
Oh!
yes,
I
always
like
news.
What
is
it?
why
do
you
smile
so?
where
did
you
hear
it?
at
Randalls?"
He
had
time
only
to
say,
"No,
not
at
Randalls;
I
have
not
been
near
Randalls,"
when
the
door
was
thrown
open,
and
Miss
Bates
and
Miss
Fairfax
walked
into
the
room.
Full
of
thanks,
and
full
of
news,
Miss
Bates
knew
not
which
to
give
quickest.
Mr.
Knightley
soon
saw
that
he
had
lost
his
moment,
and
that
not
another
syllable
of
communication
could
rest
with
him.
"Oh!
my
dear
sir,
how
are
you
this
morning?
My
dear
Miss
Woodhouse
I
come
quite
over
powered.
Such
a
beautiful
hind
quarter
of
pork!
You
are
too
bountiful!
Have
you
heard
the
news?
Mr.
Elton
is
going
to
be
married."
Emma
had
not
had
time
even
to
think
of
Mr.
Elton,
and
she
was
so
completely
surprized
that
she
could
not
avoid
a
little
start,
and
a
little
blush,
at
the
sound.
"There
is
my
news:
I
thought
it
would
interest
you,"
said
Mr.
Knightley,
with
a
smile
which
implied
a
conviction
of
some
part
of
what
had
passed
between
them.
"But
where
could
you
hear
it?"
cried
Miss
Bates.
"Where
could
you
possibly
hear
it,
Mr.
Knightley?
For
it
is
not
five
minutes
since
I
received
Mrs.
Cole's
note
no,
it
cannot
be
more
than
five
or
at
least
ten
for
I
had
got
my
bonnet
and
spencer
on,
just
ready
to
come
out
I
was
only
gone
down
to
speak
to
Patty
again
about
the
pork
Jane
was
standing
in
the
passage
were
not
you,
Jane?
for
my
mother
was
so
afraid
that
we
had
not
any
salting
pan
large
enough.
So
I
said
I
would
go
down
and
see,
and
Jane
said,
'Shall
I
go
down
instead?
for
I
think
you
have
a
little
cold,
and
Patty
has
been
washing
the
kitchen.'
'Oh!
my
dear,'
said
I
well,
and
just
then
came
the
note.
A
Miss
Hawkins
that's
all
I
know.
A
Miss
Hawkins
of
Bath.
But,
Mr.
Knightley,
how
could
you
possibly
have
heard
it?
for
the
very
moment
Mr.
Cole
told
Mrs.
Cole
of
it,
she
sat
down
and
wrote
to
me.
A
Miss
Hawkins

"I
was
with
Mr.
Cole
on
business
an
hour
and
a
half
ago.
He
had
