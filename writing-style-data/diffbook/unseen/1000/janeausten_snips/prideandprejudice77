up
stairs
you
will
see
a
finer,
larger
picture
of
him
than
this.
This
room
was
my
late
master's
favourite
room,
and
these
miniatures
are
just
as
they
used
to
be
then.
He
was
very
fond
of
them."
This
accounted
to
Elizabeth
for
Mr.
Wickham's
being
among
them.
Mrs.
Reynolds
then
directed
their
attention
to
one
of
Miss
Darcy,
drawn
when
she
was
only
eight
years
old.
"And
is
Miss
Darcy
as
handsome
as
her
brother?"
said
Mrs.
Gardiner.
"Oh!
yes
the
handsomest
young
lady
that
ever
was
seen;
and
so
accomplished!
She
plays
and
sings
all
day
long.
In
the
next
room
is
a
new
instrument
just
come
down
for
her
a
present
from
my
master;
she
comes
here
to
morrow
with
him."
Mr.
Gardiner,
whose
manners
were
very
easy
and
pleasant,
encouraged
her
communicativeness
by
his
questions
and
remarks;
Mrs.
Reynolds,
either
by
pride
or
attachment,
had
evidently
great
pleasure
in
talking
of
her
master
and
his
sister.
"Is
your
master
much
at
Pemberley
in
the
course
of
the
year?"
"Not
so
much
as
I
could
wish,
sir;
but
I
dare
say
he
may
spend
half
his
time
here;
and
Miss
Darcy
is
always
down
for
the
summer
months."
"Except,"
thought
Elizabeth,
"when
she
goes
to
Ramsgate."
"If
your
master
would
marry,
you
might
see
more
of
him."
"Yes,
sir;
but
I
do
not
know
when
that
will
be.
I
do
not
know
who
is
good
enough
for
him."
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
smiled.
Elizabeth
could
not
help
saying,
"It
is
very
much
to
his
credit,
I
am
sure,
that
you
should
think
so."
"I
say
no
more
than
the
truth,
and
everybody
will
say
that
knows
him,"
replied
the
other.
Elizabeth
thought
this
was
going
pretty
far;
and
she
listened
with
increasing
astonishment
as
the
housekeeper
added,
"I
have
never
known
a
cross
word
from
him
in
my
life,
and
I
have
known
him
ever
since
he
was
four
years
old."
This
was
praise,
of
all
others
most
extraordinary,
most
opposite
to
her
ideas.
That
he
was
not
a
good
tempered
man
had
been
her
firmest
opinion.
Her
keenest
attention
was
awakened;
she
longed
to
hear
more,
and
was
grateful
to
her
uncle
for
saying:
"There
are
very
few
people
of
whom
so
much
can
be
said.
You
are
lucky
in
having
such
a
master."
"Yes,
sir,
I
know
I
am.
If
I
were
to
go
through
the
world,
I
could
not
meet
with
a
better.
But
I
have
always
observed,
that
they
who
are
good
natured
when
children,
are
good
natured
when
they
grow
up;
and
he
was
always
the
sweetest
tempered,
most
generous
hearted
boy
in
the
world."
Elizabeth
almost
stared
at
her.
"Can
this
be
Mr.
Darcy?"
thought
she.
"His
father
was
an
excellent
man,"
said
Mrs.
Gardiner.
"Yes,
ma'am,
that
he
was
indeed;
and
his
son
will
be
just
like
him
just
as
affable
to
the
poor."
Elizabeth
listened,
wondered,
doubted,
and
was
impatient
for
more.
Mrs.
Reynolds
could
interest
her
on
no
other
point.
She
related
the
subjects
of
the
pictures,
the
dimensions
of
the
rooms,
and
the
price
of
the
furniture,
in
vain.
Mr.
Gardiner,
highly
amused
by
the
kind
of
family
prejudice
to
which
he
attributed
her
excessive
commendation
of
her
master,
soon
led
again
to
the
subject;
and
she
dwelt
with
energy
on
his
many
merits
as
they
proceeded
together
up
the
great
staircase.
"He
is
the
best
landlord,
and
the
best
master,"
said
she,
"that
ever
lived;
not
like
the
wild
young
men
nowadays,
who
think
of
nothing
but
themselves.
There
is
not
one
of
his
tenants
or
servants
but
will
give
him
a
good
name.
Some
people
call
him
proud;
but
I
am
sure
I
never
saw
anything
of
it.
To
my
fancy,
it
is
only
because
he
does
not
rattle
away
like
other
young
men."
"In
what
an
amiable
light
does
this
place
him!"
thought
Elizabeth.
"This
fine
account
of
him,"
whispered
her
aunt
as
they
walked,
"is
not
quite
consistent
with
his
behaviour
to
our
poor
friend."
"Perhaps
we
might
be
deceived."
"That
is
not
very
likely;
our
authority
was
too
good."
On
reaching
the
spacious
lobby
above
they
were
shown
into
a
very
pretty
sitting
room,
lately
fitted
up
with
greater
elegance
and
lightness
than
the
apartments
below;
and
were
informed
that
it
was
but
just
done
to
give
pleasure
to
Miss
Darcy,
who
had
taken
a
liking
to
the
room
when
last
at
Pemberley.
"He
is
certainly
a
good
brother,"
said
Elizabeth,
as
she
walked
towards
one
of
the
windows.
Mrs.
Reynolds
anticipated
Miss
Darcy's
delight,
when
she
should
enter
the
room.
"And
this
is
always
the
way
with
him,"
she
added.
"Whatever
can
give
his
sister
any
pleasure
is
sure
to
be
done
in
a
moment.
There
is
nothing
he
would
not
do
for
her."
The
picture
gallery,
and
two
or
three
of
the
principal
bedrooms,
were
all
that
remained
to
be
shown.
In
the
former
were
many
good
paintings;
but
Elizabeth
knew
nothing
of
the
art;
and
from
such
as
had
been
already
visible
below,
she
had
willingly
turned
to
look
at
some
drawings
of
Miss
Darcy's,
in
crayons,
whose
subjects
were
usually
more
interesting,
and
also
more
intelligible.
In
the
gallery
there
were
many
family
portraits,
but
they
could
have
little
to
fix
the
attention
of
a
stranger.
Elizabeth
walked
in
quest
of
the
only
face
whose
features
would
be
known
to
her.
At
last
it
arrested
her
and
she
beheld
a
striking
resemblance
to
Mr.
Darcy,
with
such
a
smile
over
the
face
as
she
remembered
to
have
sometimes
seen
when
he
looked
at
her.
She
stood
several
minutes
before
the
picture,
in
earnest
contemplation,
and
returned
to
it
again
before
they
quitted
the
gallery.
Mrs.
Reynolds
informed
them
that
it
had
been
taken
in
his
father's
lifetime.
There
was
certainly
at
this
moment,
in
Elizabeth's
mind,
a
more
gentle
sensation
towards
the
original
than
she
had
ever
felt
at
the
height
of
their
acquaintance.
The
commendation
bestowed
on
