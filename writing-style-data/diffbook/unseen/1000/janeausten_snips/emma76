I
should
have
expected
better
judgment
in
Colonel
Campbell."
From
that
moment,
Emma
could
have
taken
her
oath
that
Mr.
Knightley
had
had
no
concern
in
giving
the
instrument.
But
whether
he
were
entirely
free
from
peculiar
attachment
whether
there
were
no
actual
preference
remained
a
little
longer
doubtful.
Towards
the
end
of
Jane's
second
song,
her
voice
grew
thick.
"That
will
do,"
said
he,
when
it
was
finished,
thinking
aloud
"you
have
sung
quite
enough
for
one
evening
now
be
quiet."
Another
song,
however,
was
soon
begged
for.
"One
more;
they
would
not
fatigue
Miss
Fairfax
on
any
account,
and
would
only
ask
for
one
more."
And
Frank
Churchill
was
heard
to
say,
"I
think
you
could
manage
this
without
effort;
the
first
part
is
so
very
trifling.
The
strength
of
the
song
falls
on
the
second."
Mr.
Knightley
grew
angry.
"That
fellow,"
said
he,
indignantly,
"thinks
of
nothing
but
shewing
off
his
own
voice.
This
must
not
be."
And
touching
Miss
Bates,
who
at
that
moment
passed
near
"Miss
Bates,
are
you
mad,
to
let
your
niece
sing
herself
hoarse
in
this
manner?
Go,
and
interfere.
They
have
no
mercy
on
her."
Miss
Bates,
in
her
real
anxiety
for
Jane,
could
hardly
stay
even
to
be
grateful,
before
she
stept
forward
and
put
an
end
to
all
farther
singing.
Here
ceased
the
concert
part
of
the
evening,
for
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Miss
Fairfax
were
the
only
young
lady
performers;
but
soon
(within
five
minutes)
the
proposal
of
dancing
originating
nobody
exactly
knew
where
was
so
effectually
promoted
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cole,
that
every
thing
was
rapidly
clearing
away,
to
give
proper
space.
Mrs.
Weston,
capital
in
her
country
dances,
was
seated,
and
beginning
an
irresistible
waltz;
and
Frank
Churchill,
coming
up
with
most
becoming
gallantry
to
Emma,
had
secured
her
hand,
and
led
her
up
to
the
top.
While
waiting
till
the
other
young
people
could
pair
themselves
off,
Emma
found
time,
in
spite
of
the
compliments
she
was
receiving
on
her
voice
and
her
taste,
to
look
about,
and
see
what
became
of
Mr.
Knightley.
This
would
be
a
trial.
He
was
no
dancer
in
general.
If
he
were
to
be
very
alert
in
engaging
Jane
Fairfax
now,
it
might
augur
something.
There
was
no
immediate
appearance.
No;
he
was
talking
to
Mrs.
Cole
he
was
looking
on
unconcerned;
Jane
was
asked
by
somebody
else,
and
he
was
still
talking
to
Mrs.
Cole.
Emma
had
no
longer
an
alarm
for
Henry;
his
interest
was
yet
safe;
and
she
led
off
the
dance
with
genuine
spirit
and
enjoyment.
Not
more
than
five
couple
could
be
mustered;
but
the
rarity
and
the
suddenness
of
it
made
it
very
delightful,
and
she
found
herself
well
matched
in
a
partner.
They
were
a
couple
worth
looking
at.
Two
dances,
unfortunately,
were
all
that
could
be
allowed.
It
was
growing
late,
and
Miss
Bates
became
anxious
to
get
home,
on
her
mother's
account.
After
some
attempts,
therefore,
to
be
permitted
to
begin
again,
they
were
obliged
to
thank
Mrs.
Weston,
look
sorrowful,
and
have
done.
"Perhaps
it
is
as
well,"
said
Frank
Churchill,
as
he
attended
Emma
to
her
carriage.
"I
must
have
asked
Miss
Fairfax,
and
her
languid
dancing
would
not
have
agreed
with
me,
after
yours."
Emma
did
not
repent
her
condescension
in
going
to
the
Coles.
The
visit
afforded
her
many
pleasant
recollections
the
next
day;
and
all
that
she
might
be
supposed
to
have
lost
on
the
side
of
dignified
seclusion,
must
be
amply
repaid
in
the
splendour
of
popularity.
She
must
have
delighted
the
Coles
worthy
people,
who
deserved
to
be
made
happy!
And
left
a
name
behind
her
that
would
not
soon
die
away.
Perfect
happiness,
even
in
memory,
is
not
common;
and
there
were
two
points
on
which
she
was
not
quite
easy.
She
doubted
whether
she
had
not
transgressed
the
duty
of
woman
by
woman,
in
betraying
her
suspicions
of
Jane
Fairfax's
feelings
to
Frank
Churchill.
It
was
hardly
right;
but
it
had
been
so
strong
an
idea,
that
it
would
escape
her,
and
his
submission
to
all
that
she
told,
was
a
compliment
to
her
penetration,
which
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
be
quite
certain
that
she
ought
to
have
held
her
tongue.
The
other
circumstance
of
regret
related
also
to
Jane
Fairfax;
and
there
she
had
no
doubt.
She
did
unfeignedly
and
unequivocally
regret
the
inferiority
of
her
own
playing
and
singing.
She
did
most
heartily
grieve
over
the
idleness
of
her
childhood
and
sat
down
and
practised
vigorously
an
hour
and
a
half.
She
was
then
interrupted
by
Harriet's
coming
in;
and
if
Harriet's
praise
could
have
satisfied
her,
she
might
soon
have
been
comforted.
"Oh!
if
I
could
but
play
as
well
as
you
and
Miss
Fairfax!"
"Don't
class
us
together,
Harriet.
My
playing
is
no
more
like
her's,
than
a
lamp
is
like
sunshine."
"Oh!
dear
I
think
you
play
the
best
of
the
two.
I
think
you
play
quite
as
well
as
she
does.
I
am
sure
I
had
much
rather
hear
you.
Every
body
last
night
said
how
well
you
played."
"Those
who
knew
any
thing
about
it,
must
have
felt
the
difference.
The
truth
is,
Harriet,
that
my
playing
is
just
good
enough
to
be
praised,
but
Jane
Fairfax's
is
much
beyond
it."
"Well,
I
always
shall
think
that
you
play
quite
as
well
as
she
does,
or
that
if
there
is
any
difference
nobody
would
ever
find
it
out.
Mr.
Cole
said
how
much
taste
you
had;
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
talked
a
great
deal
about
your
taste,
and
that
he
valued
taste
much
more
than
execution."
"Ah!
but
Jane
Fairfax
has
them
both,
Harriet."
"Are
you
sure?
I
saw
she
had
execution,
but
I
did
not
know
she
had
any
taste.
Nobody
talked
about
it.
And
I
hate
Italian
singing.
There
is
no
understanding
a
word
of
it.
Besides,
if
she
does
play
so
very
well,
you
know,
it
is
no
more
