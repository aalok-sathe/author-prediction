spent
at
Donwell?
There
every
little
dissatisfaction
that
had
occurred
before
came
to
a
crisis.
I
was
late;
I
met
her
walking
home
by
herself,
and
wanted
to
walk
with
her,
but
she
would
not
suffer
it.
She
absolutely
refused
to
allow
me,
which
I
then
thought
most
unreasonable.
Now,
however,
I
see
nothing
in
it
but
a
very
natural
and
consistent
degree
of
discretion.
While
I,
to
blind
the
world
to
our
engagement,
was
behaving
one
hour
with
objectionable
particularity
to
another
woman,
was
she
to
be
consenting
the
next
to
a
proposal
which
might
have
made
every
previous
caution
useless?
Had
we
been
met
walking
together
between
Donwell
and
Highbury,
the
truth
must
have
been
suspected.
I
was
mad
enough,
however,
to
resent.
I
doubted
her
affection.
I
doubted
it
more
the
next
day
on
Box
Hill;
when,
provoked
by
such
conduct
on
my
side,
such
shameful,
insolent
neglect
of
her,
and
such
apparent
devotion
to
Miss
W.,
as
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
any
woman
of
sense
to
endure,
she
spoke
her
resentment
in
a
form
of
words
perfectly
intelligible
to
me.
In
short,
my
dear
madam,
it
was
a
quarrel
blameless
on
her
side,
abominable
on
mine;
and
I
returned
the
same
evening
to
Richmond,
though
I
might
have
staid
with
you
till
the
next
morning,
merely
because
I
would
be
as
angry
with
her
as
possible.
Even
then,
I
was
not
such
a
fool
as
not
to
mean
to
be
reconciled
in
time;
but
I
was
the
injured
person,
injured
by
her
coldness,
and
I
went
away
determined
that
she
should
make
the
first
advances.
I
shall
always
congratulate
myself
that
you
were
not
of
the
Box
Hill
party.
Had
you
witnessed
my
behaviour
there,
I
can
hardly
suppose
you
would
ever
have
thought
well
of
me
again.
Its
effect
upon
her
appears
in
the
immediate
resolution
it
produced:
as
soon
as
she
found
I
was
really
gone
from
Randalls,
she
closed
with
the
offer
of
that
officious
Mrs.
Elton;
the
whole
system
of
whose
treatment
of
her,
by
the
bye,
has
ever
filled
me
with
indignation
and
hatred.
I
must
not
quarrel
with
a
spirit
of
forbearance
which
has
been
so
richly
extended
towards
myself;
but,
otherwise,
I
should
loudly
protest
against
the
share
of
it
which
that
woman
has
known.
'Jane,'
indeed!
You
will
observe
that
I
have
not
yet
indulged
myself
in
calling
her
by
that
name,
even
to
you.
Think,
then,
what
I
must
have
endured
in
hearing
it
bandied
between
the
Eltons
with
all
the
vulgarity
of
needless
repetition,
and
all
the
insolence
of
imaginary
superiority.
Have
patience
with
me,
I
shall
soon
have
done.
She
closed
with
this
offer,
resolving
to
break
with
me
entirely,
and
wrote
the
next
day
to
tell
me
that
we
never
were
to
meet
again.
She
felt
the
engagement
to
be
a
source
of
repentance
and
misery
to
each:
she
dissolved
it.
This
letter
reached
me
on
the
very
morning
of
my
poor
aunt's
death.
I
answered
it
within
an
hour;
but
from
the
confusion
of
my
mind,
and
the
multiplicity
of
business
falling
on
me
at
once,
my
answer,
instead
of
being
sent
with
all
the
many
other
letters
of
that
day,
was
locked
up
in
my
writing
desk;
and
I,
trusting
that
I
had
written
enough,
though
but
a
few
lines,
to
satisfy
her,
remained
without
any
uneasiness.
I
was
rather
disappointed
that
I
did
not
hear
from
her
again
speedily;
but
I
made
excuses
for
her,
and
was
too
busy,
and
may
I
add?
too
cheerful
in
my
views
to
be
captious.
We
removed
to
Windsor;
and
two
days
afterwards
I
received
a
parcel
from
her,
my
own
letters
all
returned!
and
a
few
lines
at
the
same
time
by
the
post,
stating
her
extreme
surprize
at
not
having
had
the
smallest
reply
to
her
last;
and
adding,
that
as
silence
on
such
a
point
could
not
be
misconstrued,
and
as
it
must
be
equally
desirable
to
both
to
have
every
subordinate
arrangement
concluded
as
soon
as
possible,
she
now
sent
me,
by
a
safe
conveyance,
all
my
letters,
and
requested,
that
if
I
could
not
directly
command
hers,
so
as
to
send
them
to
Highbury
within
a
week,
I
would
forward
them
after
that
period
to
her
at
:
in
short,
the
full
direction
to
Mr.
Smallridge's,
near
Bristol,
stared
me
in
the
face.
I
knew
the
name,
the
place,
I
knew
all
about
it,
and
instantly
saw
what
she
had
been
doing.
It
was
perfectly
accordant
with
that
resolution
of
character
which
I
knew
her
to
possess;
and
the
secrecy
she
had
maintained,
as
to
any
such
design
in
her
former
letter,
was
equally
descriptive
of
its
anxious
delicacy.
For
the
world
would
not
she
have
seemed
to
threaten
me.
Imagine
the
shock;
imagine
how,
till
I
had
actually
detected
my
own
blunder,
I
raved
at
the
blunders
of
the
post.
What
was
to
be
done?
One
thing
only.
I
must
speak
to
my
uncle.
Without
his
sanction
I
could
not
hope
to
be
listened
to
again.
I
spoke;
circumstances
were
in
my
favour;
the
late
event
had
softened
away
his
pride,
and
he
was,
earlier
than
I
could
have
anticipated,
wholly
reconciled
and
complying;
and
could
say
at
last,
poor
man!
with
a
deep
sigh,
that
he
wished
I
might
find
as
much
happiness
in
the
marriage
state
as
he
had
done.
I
felt
that
it
would
be
of
a
different
sort.
Are
you
disposed
to
pity
me
for
what
I
must
have
suffered
in
opening
the
cause
to
him,
for
my
suspense
while
all
was
at
stake?
No;
do
not
pity
me
till
I
reached
Highbury,
and
saw
how
ill
I
had
made
her.
Do
not
pity
me
till
I
saw
her
wan,
sick
looks.
I
reached
Highbury
at
the
time
of
day
when,
from
my
knowledge
of
their
late
breakfast
hour,
I
was
certain
of
a
good
chance
of
finding
her
alone.
I
was
not
