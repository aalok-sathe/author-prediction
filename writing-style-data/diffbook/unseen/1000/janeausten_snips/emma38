dreaded
being
quarrelsome;
her
heroism
reached
only
to
silence.
She
allowed
him
to
talk,
and
arranged
the
glasses,
and
wrapped
herself
up,
without
opening
her
lips.
They
arrived,
the
carriage
turned,
the
step
was
let
down,
and
Mr.
Elton,
spruce,
black,
and
smiling,
was
with
them
instantly.
Emma
thought
with
pleasure
of
some
change
of
subject.
Mr.
Elton
was
all
obligation
and
cheerfulness;
he
was
so
very
cheerful
in
his
civilities
indeed,
that
she
began
to
think
he
must
have
received
a
different
account
of
Harriet
from
what
had
reached
her.
She
had
sent
while
dressing,
and
the
answer
had
been,
"Much
the
same
not
better."
"My
report
from
Mrs.
Goddard's,"
said
she
presently,
"was
not
so
pleasant
as
I
had
hoped
'Not
better'
was
my
answer."
His
face
lengthened
immediately;
and
his
voice
was
the
voice
of
sentiment
as
he
answered.
"Oh!
no
I
am
grieved
to
find
I
was
on
the
point
of
telling
you
that
when
I
called
at
Mrs.
Goddard's
door,
which
I
did
the
very
last
thing
before
I
returned
to
dress,
I
was
told
that
Miss
Smith
was
not
better,
by
no
means
better,
rather
worse.
Very
much
grieved
and
concerned
I
had
flattered
myself
that
she
must
be
better
after
such
a
cordial
as
I
knew
had
been
given
her
in
the
morning."
Emma
smiled
and
answered
"My
visit
was
of
use
to
the
nervous
part
of
her
complaint,
I
hope;
but
not
even
I
can
charm
away
a
sore
throat;
it
is
a
most
severe
cold
indeed.
Mr.
Perry
has
been
with
her,
as
you
probably
heard."
"Yes
I
imagined
that
is
I
did
not
"
"He
has
been
used
to
her
in
these
complaints,
and
I
hope
to
morrow
morning
will
bring
us
both
a
more
comfortable
report.
But
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
uneasiness.
Such
a
sad
loss
to
our
party
to
day!"
"Dreadful!
Exactly
so,
indeed.
She
will
be
missed
every
moment."
This
was
very
proper;
the
sigh
which
accompanied
it
was
really
estimable;
but
it
should
have
lasted
longer.
Emma
was
rather
in
dismay
when
only
half
a
minute
afterwards
he
began
to
speak
of
other
things,
and
in
a
voice
of
the
greatest
alacrity
and
enjoyment.
"What
an
excellent
device,"
said
he,
"the
use
of
a
sheepskin
for
carriages.
How
very
comfortable
they
make
it;
impossible
to
feel
cold
with
such
precautions.
The
contrivances
of
modern
days
indeed
have
rendered
a
gentleman's
carriage
perfectly
complete.
One
is
so
fenced
and
guarded
from
the
weather,
that
not
a
breath
of
air
can
find
its
way
unpermitted.
Weather
becomes
absolutely
of
no
consequence.
It
is
a
very
cold
afternoon
but
in
this
carriage
we
know
nothing
of
the
matter.
Ha!
snows
a
little
I
see."
"Yes,"
said
John
Knightley,
"and
I
think
we
shall
have
a
good
deal
of
it."
"Christmas
weather,"
observed
Mr.
Elton.
"Quite
seasonable;
and
extremely
fortunate
we
may
think
ourselves
that
it
did
not
begin
yesterday,
and
prevent
this
day's
party,
which
it
might
very
possibly
have
done,
for
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
hardly
have
ventured
had
there
been
much
snow
on
the
ground;
but
now
it
is
of
no
consequence.
This
is
quite
the
season
indeed
for
friendly
meetings.
At
Christmas
every
body
invites
their
friends
about
them,
and
people
think
little
of
even
the
worst
weather.
I
was
snowed
up
at
a
friend's
house
once
for
a
week.
Nothing
could
be
pleasanter.
I
went
for
only
one
night,
and
could
not
get
away
till
that
very
day
se'nnight."
Mr.
John
Knightley
looked
as
if
he
did
not
comprehend
the
pleasure,
but
said
only,
coolly,
"I
cannot
wish
to
be
snowed
up
a
week
at
Randalls."
At
another
time
Emma
might
have
been
amused,
but
she
was
too
much
astonished
now
at
Mr.
Elton's
spirits
for
other
feelings.
Harriet
seemed
quite
forgotten
in
the
expectation
of
a
pleasant
party.
"We
are
sure
of
excellent
fires,"
continued
he,
"and
every
thing
in
the
greatest
comfort.
Charming
people,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston;
Mrs.
Weston
indeed
is
much
beyond
praise,
and
he
is
exactly
what
one
values,
so
hospitable,
and
so
fond
of
society;
it
will
be
a
small
party,
but
where
small
parties
are
select,
they
are
perhaps
the
most
agreeable
of
any.
Mr.
Weston's
dining
room
does
not
accommodate
more
than
ten
comfortably;
and
for
my
part,
I
would
rather,
under
such
circumstances,
fall
short
by
two
than
exceed
by
two.
I
think
you
will
agree
with
me,
(turning
with
a
soft
air
to
Emma,)
I
think
I
shall
certainly
have
your
approbation,
though
Mr.
Knightley
perhaps,
from
being
used
to
the
large
parties
of
London,
may
not
quite
enter
into
our
feelings."
"I
know
nothing
of
the
large
parties
of
London,
sir
I
never
dine
with
any
body."
"Indeed!
(in
a
tone
of
wonder
and
pity,)
I
had
no
idea
that
the
law
had
been
so
great
a
slavery.
Well,
sir,
the
time
must
come
when
you
will
be
paid
for
all
this,
when
you
will
have
little
labour
and
great
enjoyment."
"My
first
enjoyment,"
replied
John
Knightley,
as
they
passed
through
the
sweep
gate,
"will
be
to
find
myself
safe
at
Hartfield
again."
Some
change
of
countenance
was
necessary
for
each
gentleman
as
they
walked
into
Mrs.
Weston's
drawing
room;
Mr.
Elton
must
compose
his
joyous
looks,
and
Mr.
John
Knightley
disperse
his
ill
humour.
Mr.
Elton
must
smile
less,
and
Mr.
John
Knightley
more,
to
fit
them
for
the
place.
Emma
only
might
be
as
nature
prompted,
and
shew
herself
just
as
happy
as
she
was.
To
her
it
was
real
enjoyment
to
be
with
the
Westons.
Mr.
Weston
was
a
great
favourite,
and
there
was
not
a
creature
in
the
world
to
whom
she
spoke
with
such
unreserve,
as
to
his
wife;
not
any
one,
to
whom
she
related
with
such
conviction
of
being
listened
to
and
understood,
of
being
always
interesting
and
always
intelligible,
the
little
affairs,
arrangements,
perplexities,
and
pleasures
of
her
father
and
herself.
She
could
tell
nothing
