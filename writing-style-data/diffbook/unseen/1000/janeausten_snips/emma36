and
daughter's
carriage
and
horses
were
actually
at
Hartfield,
he
was
not
able
to
make
more
than
a
simple
question
on
that
head;
it
hardly
amounted
to
a
doubt;
nor
did
it
occupy
Emma
long
to
convince
him
that
they
might
in
one
of
the
carriages
find
room
for
Harriet
also.
Harriet,
Mr.
Elton,
and
Mr.
Knightley,
their
own
especial
set,
were
the
only
persons
invited
to
meet
them;
the
hours
were
to
be
early,
as
well
as
the
numbers
few;
Mr.
Woodhouse's
habits
and
inclination
being
consulted
in
every
thing.
The
evening
before
this
great
event
(for
it
was
a
very
great
event
that
Mr.
Woodhouse
should
dine
out,
on
the
24th
of
December)
had
been
spent
by
Harriet
at
Hartfield,
and
she
had
gone
home
so
much
indisposed
with
a
cold,
that,
but
for
her
own
earnest
wish
of
being
nursed
by
Mrs.
Goddard,
Emma
could
not
have
allowed
her
to
leave
the
house.
Emma
called
on
her
the
next
day,
and
found
her
doom
already
signed
with
regard
to
Randalls.
She
was
very
feverish
and
had
a
bad
sore
throat:
Mrs.
Goddard
was
full
of
care
and
affection,
Mr.
Perry
was
talked
of,
and
Harriet
herself
was
too
ill
and
low
to
resist
the
authority
which
excluded
her
from
this
delightful
engagement,
though
she
could
not
speak
of
her
loss
without
many
tears.
Emma
sat
with
her
as
long
as
she
could,
to
attend
her
in
Mrs.
Goddard's
unavoidable
absences,
and
raise
her
spirits
by
representing
how
much
Mr.
Elton's
would
be
depressed
when
he
knew
her
state;
and
left
her
at
last
tolerably
comfortable,
in
the
sweet
dependence
of
his
having
a
most
comfortless
visit,
and
of
their
all
missing
her
very
much.
She
had
not
advanced
many
yards
from
Mrs.
Goddard's
door,
when
she
was
met
by
Mr.
Elton
himself,
evidently
coming
towards
it,
and
as
they
walked
on
slowly
together
in
conversation
about
the
invalid
of
whom
he,
on
the
rumour
of
considerable
illness,
had
been
going
to
inquire,
that
he
might
carry
some
report
of
her
to
Hartfield
they
were
overtaken
by
Mr.
John
Knightley
returning
from
the
daily
visit
to
Donwell,
with
his
two
eldest
boys,
whose
healthy,
glowing
faces
shewed
all
the
benefit
of
a
country
run,
and
seemed
to
ensure
a
quick
despatch
of
the
roast
mutton
and
rice
pudding
they
were
hastening
home
for.
They
joined
company
and
proceeded
together.
Emma
was
just
describing
the
nature
of
her
friend's
complaint;
"a
throat
very
much
inflamed,
with
a
great
deal
of
heat
about
her,
a
quick,
low
pulse,
&c.
and
she
was
sorry
to
find
from
Mrs.
Goddard
that
Harriet
was
liable
to
very
bad
sore
throats,
and
had
often
alarmed
her
with
them."
Mr.
Elton
looked
all
alarm
on
the
occasion,
as
he
exclaimed,
"A
sore
throat!
I
hope
not
infectious.
I
hope
not
of
a
putrid
infectious
sort.
Has
Perry
seen
her?
Indeed
you
should
take
care
of
yourself
as
well
as
of
your
friend.
Let
me
entreat
you
to
run
no
risks.
Why
does
not
Perry
see
her?"
Emma,
who
was
not
really
at
all
frightened
herself,
tranquillised
this
excess
of
apprehension
by
assurances
of
Mrs.
Goddard's
experience
and
care;
but
as
there
must
still
remain
a
degree
of
uneasiness
which
she
could
not
wish
to
reason
away,
which
she
would
rather
feed
and
assist
than
not,
she
added
soon
afterwards
as
if
quite
another
subject,
"It
is
so
cold,
so
very
cold
and
looks
and
feels
so
very
much
like
snow,
that
if
it
were
to
any
other
place
or
with
any
other
party,
I
should
really
try
not
to
go
out
to
day
and
dissuade
my
father
from
venturing;
but
as
he
has
made
up
his
mind,
and
does
not
seem
to
feel
the
cold
himself,
I
do
not
like
to
interfere,
as
I
know
it
would
be
so
great
a
disappointment
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston.
But,
upon
my
word,
Mr.
Elton,
in
your
case,
I
should
certainly
excuse
myself.
You
appear
to
me
a
little
hoarse
already,
and
when
you
consider
what
demand
of
voice
and
what
fatigues
to
morrow
will
bring,
I
think
it
would
be
no
more
than
common
prudence
to
stay
at
home
and
take
care
of
yourself
to
night."
Mr.
Elton
looked
as
if
he
did
not
very
well
know
what
answer
to
make;
which
was
exactly
the
case;
for
though
very
much
gratified
by
the
kind
care
of
such
a
fair
lady,
and
not
liking
to
resist
any
advice
of
her's,
he
had
not
really
the
least
inclination
to
give
up
the
visit;
but
Emma,
too
eager
and
busy
in
her
own
previous
conceptions
and
views
to
hear
him
impartially,
or
see
him
with
clear
vision,
was
very
well
satisfied
with
his
muttering
acknowledgment
of
its
being
"very
cold,
certainly
very
cold,"
and
walked
on,
rejoicing
in
having
extricated
him
from
Randalls,
and
secured
him
the
power
of
sending
to
inquire
after
Harriet
every
hour
of
the
evening.
"You
do
quite
right,"
said
she;
"we
will
make
your
apologies
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston."
But
hardly
had
she
so
spoken,
when
she
found
her
brother
was
civilly
offering
a
seat
in
his
carriage,
if
the
weather
were
Mr.
Elton's
only
objection,
and
Mr.
Elton
actually
accepting
the
offer
with
much
prompt
satisfaction.
It
was
a
done
thing;
Mr.
Elton
was
to
go,
and
never
had
his
broad
handsome
face
expressed
more
pleasure
than
at
this
moment;
never
had
his
smile
been
stronger,
nor
his
eyes
more
exulting
than
when
he
next
looked
at
her.
"Well,"
said
she
to
herself,
"this
is
most
strange!
After
I
had
got
him
off
so
well,
to
chuse
to
go
into
company,
and
leave
Harriet
ill
behind!
Most
strange
indeed!
But
there
is,
I
believe,
in
many
men,
especially
single
men,
such
an
inclination
such
a
passion
for
dining
out
a
dinner
engagement
is
so
high
in
the
class
of
their
pleasures,
their
employments,
their
dignities,
almost
their
duties,
that
any
thing
gives
