such
a
risk.
But
against
this
there
were
objections;
and
she
finally
resolved
that
it
could
be
the
last
resource,
if
her
private
inquiries
to
the
absence
of
the
family
were
unfavourably
answered.
Accordingly,
when
she
retired
at
night,
she
asked
the
chambermaid
whether
Pemberley
were
not
a
very
fine
place?
what
was
the
name
of
its
proprietor?
and,
with
no
little
alarm,
whether
the
family
were
down
for
the
summer?
A
most
welcome
negative
followed
the
last
question
and
her
alarms
now
being
removed,
she
was
at
leisure
to
feel
a
great
deal
of
curiosity
to
see
the
house
herself;
and
when
the
subject
was
revived
the
next
morning,
and
she
was
again
applied
to,
could
readily
answer,
and
with
a
proper
air
of
indifference,
that
she
had
not
really
any
dislike
to
the
scheme.
To
Pemberley,
therefore,
they
were
to
go.
Elizabeth,
as
they
drove
along,
watched
for
the
first
appearance
of
Pemberley
Woods
with
some
perturbation;
and
when
at
length
they
turned
in
at
the
lodge,
her
spirits
were
in
a
high
flutter.
The
park
was
very
large,
and
contained
great
variety
of
ground.
They
entered
it
in
one
of
its
lowest
points,
and
drove
for
some
time
through
a
beautiful
wood
stretching
over
a
wide
extent.
Elizabeth's
mind
was
too
full
for
conversation,
but
she
saw
and
admired
every
remarkable
spot
and
point
of
view.
They
gradually
ascended
for
half
a
mile,
and
then
found
themselves
at
the
top
of
a
considerable
eminence,
where
the
wood
ceased,
and
the
eye
was
instantly
caught
by
Pemberley
House,
situated
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
valley,
into
which
the
road
with
some
abruptness
wound.
It
was
a
large,
handsome
stone
building,
standing
well
on
rising
ground,
and
backed
by
a
ridge
of
high
woody
hills;
and
in
front,
a
stream
of
some
natural
importance
was
swelled
into
greater,
but
without
any
artificial
appearance.
Its
banks
were
neither
formal
nor
falsely
adorned.
Elizabeth
was
delighted.
She
had
never
seen
a
place
for
which
nature
had
done
more,
or
where
natural
beauty
had
been
so
little
counteracted
by
an
awkward
taste.
They
were
all
of
them
warm
in
their
admiration;
and
at
that
moment
she
felt
that
to
be
mistress
of
Pemberley
might
be
something!
They
descended
the
hill,
crossed
the
bridge,
and
drove
to
the
door;
and,
while
examining
the
nearer
aspect
of
the
house,
all
her
apprehension
of
meeting
its
owner
returned.
She
dreaded
lest
the
chambermaid
had
been
mistaken.
On
applying
to
see
the
place,
they
were
admitted
into
the
hall;
and
Elizabeth,
as
they
waited
for
the
housekeeper,
had
leisure
to
wonder
at
her
being
where
she
was.
The
housekeeper
came;
a
respectable
looking
elderly
woman,
much
less
fine,
and
more
civil,
than
she
had
any
notion
of
finding
her.
They
followed
her
into
the
dining
parlour.
It
was
a
large,
well
proportioned
room,
handsomely
fitted
up.
Elizabeth,
after
slightly
surveying
it,
went
to
a
window
to
enjoy
its
prospect.
The
hill,
crowned
with
wood,
which
they
had
descended,
receiving
increased
abruptness
from
the
distance,
was
a
beautiful
object.
Every
disposition
of
the
ground
was
good;
and
she
looked
on
the
whole
scene,
the
river,
the
trees
scattered
on
its
banks
and
the
winding
of
the
valley,
as
far
as
she
could
trace
it,
with
delight.
As
they
passed
into
other
rooms
these
objects
were
taking
different
positions;
but
from
every
window
there
were
beauties
to
be
seen.
The
rooms
were
lofty
and
handsome,
and
their
furniture
suitable
to
the
fortune
of
its
proprietor;
but
Elizabeth
saw,
with
admiration
of
his
taste,
that
it
was
neither
gaudy
nor
uselessly
fine;
with
less
of
splendour,
and
more
real
elegance,
than
the
furniture
of
Rosings.
"And
of
this
place,"
thought
she,
"I
might
have
been
mistress!
With
these
rooms
I
might
now
have
been
familiarly
acquainted!
Instead
of
viewing
them
as
a
stranger,
I
might
have
rejoiced
in
them
as
my
own,
and
welcomed
to
them
as
visitors
my
uncle
and
aunt.
But
no,"
recollecting
herself
"that
could
never
be;
my
uncle
and
aunt
would
have
been
lost
to
me;
I
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
invite
them."
This
was
a
lucky
recollection
it
saved
her
from
something
very
like
regret.
She
longed
to
inquire
of
the
housekeeper
whether
her
master
was
really
absent,
but
had
not
the
courage
for
it.
At
length
however,
the
question
was
asked
by
her
uncle;
and
she
turned
away
with
alarm,
while
Mrs.
Reynolds
replied
that
he
was,
adding,
"But
we
expect
him
to
morrow,
with
a
large
party
of
friends."
How
rejoiced
was
Elizabeth
that
their
own
journey
had
not
by
any
circumstance
been
delayed
a
day!
Her
aunt
now
called
her
to
look
at
a
picture.
She
approached
and
saw
the
likeness
of
Mr.
Wickham,
suspended,
amongst
several
other
miniatures,
over
the
mantelpiece.
Her
aunt
asked
her,
smilingly,
how
she
liked
it.
The
housekeeper
came
forward,
and
told
them
it
was
a
picture
of
a
young
gentleman,
the
son
of
her
late
master's
steward,
who
had
been
brought
up
by
him
at
his
own
expense.
"He
is
now
gone
into
the
army,"
she
added;
"but
I
am
afraid
he
has
turned
out
very
wild."
Mrs.
Gardiner
looked
at
her
niece
with
a
smile,
but
Elizabeth
could
not
return
it.
"And
that,"
said
Mrs.
Reynolds,
pointing
to
another
of
the
miniatures,
"is
my
master
and
very
like
him.
It
was
drawn
at
the
same
time
as
the
other
about
eight
years
ago."
"I
have
heard
much
of
your
master's
fine
person,"
said
Mrs.
Gardiner,
looking
at
the
picture;
"it
is
a
handsome
face.
But,
Lizzy,
you
can
tell
us
whether
it
is
like
or
not."
Mrs.
Reynolds
respect
for
Elizabeth
seemed
to
increase
on
this
intimation
of
her
knowing
her
master.
"Does
that
young
lady
know
Mr.
Darcy?"
Elizabeth
coloured,
and
said:
"A
little."
"And
do
not
you
think
him
a
very
handsome
gentleman,
ma'am?"
"Yes,
very
handsome."
"I
am
sure
I
know
none
so
handsome;
