a
very
slow
walker,
and
my
pace
would
be
tedious
to
you;
and,
besides,
you
have
another
long
walk
before
you,
to
Donwell
Abbey."
"Thank
you,
sir,
thank
you;
I
am
going
this
moment
myself;
and
I
think
the
sooner
you
go
the
better.
I
will
fetch
your
greatcoat
and
open
the
garden
door
for
you."
Mr.
Woodhouse
at
last
was
off;
but
Mr.
Knightley,
instead
of
being
immediately
off
likewise,
sat
down
again,
seemingly
inclined
for
more
chat.
He
began
speaking
of
Harriet,
and
speaking
of
her
with
more
voluntary
praise
than
Emma
had
ever
heard
before.
"I
cannot
rate
her
beauty
as
you
do,"
said
he;
"but
she
is
a
pretty
little
creature,
and
I
am
inclined
to
think
very
well
of
her
disposition.
Her
character
depends
upon
those
she
is
with;
but
in
good
hands
she
will
turn
out
a
valuable
woman."
"I
am
glad
you
think
so;
and
the
good
hands,
I
hope,
may
not
be
wanting."
"Come,"
said
he,
"you
are
anxious
for
a
compliment,
so
I
will
tell
you
that
you
have
improved
her.
You
have
cured
her
of
her
school
girl's
giggle;
she
really
does
you
credit."
"Thank
you.
I
should
be
mortified
indeed
if
I
did
not
believe
I
had
been
of
some
use;
but
it
is
not
every
body
who
will
bestow
praise
where
they
may.
You
do
not
often
overpower
me
with
it."
"You
are
expecting
her
again,
you
say,
this
morning?"
"Almost
every
moment.
She
has
been
gone
longer
already
than
she
intended."
"Something
has
happened
to
delay
her;
some
visitors
perhaps."
"Highbury
gossips!
Tiresome
wretches!"
"Harriet
may
not
consider
every
body
tiresome
that
you
would."
Emma
knew
this
was
too
true
for
contradiction,
and
therefore
said
nothing.
He
presently
added,
with
a
smile,
"I
do
not
pretend
to
fix
on
times
or
places,
but
I
must
tell
you
that
I
have
good
reason
to
believe
your
little
friend
will
soon
hear
of
something
to
her
advantage."
"Indeed!
how
so?
of
what
sort?"
"A
very
serious
sort,
I
assure
you;"
still
smiling.
"Very
serious!
I
can
think
of
but
one
thing
Who
is
in
love
with
her?
Who
makes
you
their
confidant?"
Emma
was
more
than
half
in
hopes
of
Mr.
Elton's
having
dropt
a
hint.
Mr.
Knightley
was
a
sort
of
general
friend
and
adviser,
and
she
knew
Mr.
Elton
looked
up
to
him.
"I
have
reason
to
think,"
he
replied,
"that
Harriet
Smith
will
soon
have
an
offer
of
marriage,
and
from
a
most
unexceptionable
quarter:
Robert
Martin
is
the
man.
Her
visit
to
Abbey
Mill,
this
summer,
seems
to
have
done
his
business.
He
is
desperately
in
love
and
means
to
marry
her."
"He
is
very
obliging,"
said
Emma;
"but
is
he
sure
that
Harriet
means
to
marry
him?"
"Well,
well,
means
to
make
her
an
offer
then.
Will
that
do?
He
came
to
the
Abbey
two
evenings
ago,
on
purpose
to
consult
me
about
it.
He
knows
I
have
a
thorough
regard
for
him
and
all
his
family,
and,
I
believe,
considers
me
as
one
of
his
best
friends.
He
came
to
ask
me
whether
I
thought
it
would
be
imprudent
in
him
to
settle
so
early;
whether
I
thought
her
too
young:
in
short,
whether
I
approved
his
choice
altogether;
having
some
apprehension
perhaps
of
her
being
considered
(especially
since
your
making
so
much
of
her)
as
in
a
line
of
society
above
him.
I
was
very
much
pleased
with
all
that
he
said.
I
never
hear
better
sense
from
any
one
than
Robert
Martin.
He
always
speaks
to
the
purpose;
open,
straightforward,
and
very
well
judging.
He
told
me
every
thing;
his
circumstances
and
plans,
and
what
they
all
proposed
doing
in
the
event
of
his
marriage.
He
is
an
excellent
young
man,
both
as
son
and
brother.
I
had
no
hesitation
in
advising
him
to
marry.
He
proved
to
me
that
he
could
afford
it;
and
that
being
the
case,
I
was
convinced
he
could
not
do
better.
I
praised
the
fair
lady
too,
and
altogether
sent
him
away
very
happy.
If
he
had
never
esteemed
my
opinion
before,
he
would
have
thought
highly
of
me
then;
and,
I
dare
say,
left
the
house
thinking
me
the
best
friend
and
counsellor
man
ever
had.
This
happened
the
night
before
last.
Now,
as
we
may
fairly
suppose,
he
would
not
allow
much
time
to
pass
before
he
spoke
to
the
lady,
and
as
he
does
not
appear
to
have
spoken
yesterday,
it
is
not
unlikely
that
he
should
be
at
Mrs.
Goddard's
to
day;
and
she
may
be
detained
by
a
visitor,
without
thinking
him
at
all
a
tiresome
wretch."
"Pray,
Mr.
Knightley,"
said
Emma,
who
had
been
smiling
to
herself
through
a
great
part
of
this
speech,
"how
do
you
know
that
Mr.
Martin
did
not
speak
yesterday?"
"Certainly,"
replied
he,
surprized,
"I
do
not
absolutely
know
it;
but
it
may
be
inferred.
Was
not
she
the
whole
day
with
you?"
"Come,"
said
she,
"I
will
tell
you
something,
in
return
for
what
you
have
told
me.
He
did
speak
yesterday
that
is,
he
wrote,
and
was
refused."
This
was
obliged
to
be
repeated
before
it
could
be
believed;
and
Mr.
Knightley
actually
looked
red
with
surprize
and
displeasure,
as
he
stood
up,
in
tall
indignation,
and
said,
"Then
she
is
a
greater
simpleton
than
I
ever
believed
her.
What
is
the
foolish
girl
about?"
"Oh!
to
be
sure,"
cried
Emma,
"it
is
always
incomprehensible
to
a
man
that
a
woman
should
ever
refuse
an
offer
of
marriage.
A
man
always
imagines
a
woman
to
be
ready
for
any
body
who
asks
her."
"Nonsense!
a
man
does
not
imagine
any
such
thing.
But
what
is
the
meaning
of
this?
Harriet
Smith
refuse
Robert
Martin?
madness,
if
it
is
so;
but
I
hope
you
are
mistaken."
"I
saw
her
answer!
nothing
could
be
clearer."
"You
saw
her
answer!
you
wrote
her
answer
too.
Emma,
this
is
your
doing.
You
persuaded
her
to
refuse
