unhappy;
and
that
it
should
be
through
her
means
that
she,
his
favourite
child,
should
be
distressing
him
by
her
choice,
should
be
filling
him
with
fears
and
regrets
in
disposing
of
her
was
a
wretched
reflection,
and
she
sat
in
misery
till
Mr.
Darcy
appeared
again,
when,
looking
at
him,
she
was
a
little
relieved
by
his
smile.
In
a
few
minutes
he
approached
the
table
where
she
was
sitting
with
Kitty;
and,
while
pretending
to
admire
her
work
said
in
a
whisper,
"Go
to
your
father,
he
wants
you
in
the
library."
She
was
gone
directly.
Her
father
was
walking
about
the
room,
looking
grave
and
anxious.
"Lizzy,"
said
he,
"what
are
you
doing?
Are
you
out
of
your
senses,
to
be
accepting
this
man?
Have
not
you
always
hated
him?"
How
earnestly
did
she
then
wish
that
her
former
opinions
had
been
more
reasonable,
her
expressions
more
moderate!
It
would
have
spared
her
from
explanations
and
professions
which
it
was
exceedingly
awkward
to
give;
but
they
were
now
necessary,
and
she
assured
him,
with
some
confusion,
of
her
attachment
to
Mr.
Darcy.
"Or,
in
other
words,
you
are
determined
to
have
him.
He
is
rich,
to
be
sure,
and
you
may
have
more
fine
clothes
and
fine
carriages
than
Jane.
But
will
they
make
you
happy?"
"Have
you
any
other
objection,"
said
Elizabeth,
"than
your
belief
of
my
indifference?"
"None
at
all.
We
all
know
him
to
be
a
proud,
unpleasant
sort
of
man;
but
this
would
be
nothing
if
you
really
liked
him."
"I
do,
I
do
like
him,"
she
replied,
with
tears
in
her
eyes,
"I
love
him.
Indeed
he
has
no
improper
pride.
He
is
perfectly
amiable.
You
do
not
know
what
he
really
is;
then
pray
do
not
pain
me
by
speaking
of
him
in
such
terms."
"Lizzy,"
said
her
father,
"I
have
given
him
my
consent.
He
is
the
kind
of
man,
indeed,
to
whom
I
should
never
dare
refuse
anything,
which
he
condescended
to
ask.
I
now
give
it
to
you,
if
you
are
resolved
on
having
him.
But
let
me
advise
you
to
think
better
of
it.
I
know
your
disposition,
Lizzy.
I
know
that
you
could
be
neither
happy
nor
respectable,
unless
you
truly
esteemed
your
husband;
unless
you
looked
up
to
him
as
a
superior.
Your
lively
talents
would
place
you
in
the
greatest
danger
in
an
unequal
marriage.
You
could
scarcely
escape
discredit
and
misery.
My
child,
let
me
not
have
the
grief
of
seeing
you
unable
to
respect
your
partner
in
life.
You
know
not
what
you
are
about."
Elizabeth,
still
more
affected,
was
earnest
and
solemn
in
her
reply;
and
at
length,
by
repeated
assurances
that
Mr.
Darcy
was
really
the
object
of
her
choice,
by
explaining
the
gradual
change
which
her
estimation
of
him
had
undergone,
relating
her
absolute
certainty
that
his
affection
was
not
the
work
of
a
day,
but
had
stood
the
test
of
many
months'
suspense,
and
enumerating
with
energy
all
his
good
qualities,
she
did
conquer
her
father's
incredulity,
and
reconcile
him
to
the
match.
"Well,
my
dear,"
said
he,
when
she
ceased
speaking,
"I
have
no
more
to
say.
If
this
be
the
case,
he
deserves
you.
I
could
not
have
parted
with
you,
my
Lizzy,
to
anyone
less
worthy."
To
complete
the
favourable
impression,
she
then
told
him
what
Mr.
Darcy
had
voluntarily
done
for
Lydia.
He
heard
her
with
astonishment.
"This
is
an
evening
of
wonders,
indeed!
And
so,
Darcy
did
every
thing;
made
up
the
match,
gave
the
money,
paid
the
fellow's
debts,
and
got
him
his
commission!
So
much
the
better.
It
will
save
me
a
world
of
trouble
and
economy.
Had
it
been
your
uncle's
doing,
I
must
and
would
have
paid
him;
but
these
violent
young
lovers
carry
every
thing
their
own
way.
I
shall
offer
to
pay
him
to
morrow;
he
will
rant
and
storm
about
his
love
for
you,
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
the
matter."
He
then
recollected
her
embarrassment
a
few
days
before,
on
his
reading
Mr.
Collins's
letter;
and
after
laughing
at
her
some
time,
allowed
her
at
last
to
go
saying,
as
she
quitted
the
room,
"If
any
young
men
come
for
Mary
or
Kitty,
send
them
in,
for
I
am
quite
at
leisure."
Elizabeth's
mind
was
now
relieved
from
a
very
heavy
weight;
and,
after
half
an
hour's
quiet
reflection
in
her
own
room,
she
was
able
to
join
the
others
with
tolerable
composure.
Every
thing
was
too
recent
for
gaiety,
but
the
evening
passed
tranquilly
away;
there
was
no
longer
anything
material
to
be
dreaded,
and
the
comfort
of
ease
and
familiarity
would
come
in
time.
When
her
mother
went
up
to
her
dressing
room
at
night,
she
followed
her,
and
made
the
important
communication.
Its
effect
was
most
extraordinary;
for
on
first
hearing
it,
Mrs.
Bennet
sat
quite
still,
and
unable
to
utter
a
syllable.
Nor
was
it
under
many,
many
minutes
that
she
could
comprehend
what
she
heard;
though
not
in
general
backward
to
credit
what
was
for
the
advantage
of
her
family,
or
that
came
in
the
shape
of
a
lover
to
any
of
them.
She
began
at
length
to
recover,
to
fidget
about
in
her
chair,
get
up,
sit
down
again,
wonder,
and
bless
herself.
"Good
gracious!
Lord
bless
me!
only
think!
dear
me!
Mr.
Darcy!
Who
would
have
thought
it!
And
is
it
really
true?
Oh!
my
sweetest
Lizzy!
how
rich
and
how
great
you
will
be!
What
pin
money,
what
jewels,
what
carriages
you
will
have!
Jane's
is
nothing
to
it
nothing
at
all.
I
am
so
pleased
so
happy.
Such
a
charming
man!
so
handsome!
so
tall!
Oh,
my
dear
Lizzy!
pray
apologise
for
my
having
disliked
him
so
much
before.
I
hope
he
will
overlook
it.
Dear,
dear
Lizzy.
A
house
in
town!
Every
thing
that
is
charming!
Three
daughters
married!
Ten
thousand
a
year!
Oh,
Lord!
What
will
become
of
me.
I
shall
go
