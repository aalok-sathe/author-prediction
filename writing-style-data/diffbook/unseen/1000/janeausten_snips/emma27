to
come.
They
are
very
fond
of
being
at
Hartfield,
Harriet."
"I
dare
say
they
are,
sir.
I
am
sure
I
do
not
know
who
is
not."
"Henry
is
a
fine
boy,
but
John
is
very
like
his
mama.
Henry
is
the
eldest,
he
was
named
after
me,
not
after
his
father.
John,
the
second,
is
named
after
his
father.
Some
people
are
surprized,
I
believe,
that
the
eldest
was
not,
but
Isabella
would
have
him
called
Henry,
which
I
thought
very
pretty
of
her.
And
he
is
a
very
clever
boy,
indeed.
They
are
all
remarkably
clever;
and
they
have
so
many
pretty
ways.
They
will
come
and
stand
by
my
chair,
and
say,
'Grandpapa,
can
you
give
me
a
bit
of
string?'
and
once
Henry
asked
me
for
a
knife,
but
I
told
him
knives
were
only
made
for
grandpapas.
I
think
their
father
is
too
rough
with
them
very
often."
"He
appears
rough
to
you,"
said
Emma,
"because
you
are
so
very
gentle
yourself;
but
if
you
could
compare
him
with
other
papas,
you
would
not
think
him
rough.
He
wishes
his
boys
to
be
active
and
hardy;
and
if
they
misbehave,
can
give
them
a
sharp
word
now
and
then;
but
he
is
an
affectionate
father
certainly
Mr.
John
Knightley
is
an
affectionate
father.
The
children
are
all
fond
of
him."
"And
then
their
uncle
comes
in,
and
tosses
them
up
to
the
ceiling
in
a
very
frightful
way!"
"But
they
like
it,
papa;
there
is
nothing
they
like
so
much.
It
is
such
enjoyment
to
them,
that
if
their
uncle
did
not
lay
down
the
rule
of
their
taking
turns,
whichever
began
would
never
give
way
to
the
other."
"Well,
I
cannot
understand
it."
"That
is
the
case
with
us
all,
papa.
One
half
of
the
world
cannot
understand
the
pleasures
of
the
other."
Later
in
the
morning,
and
just
as
the
girls
were
going
to
separate
in
preparation
for
the
regular
four
o'clock
dinner,
the
hero
of
this
inimitable
charade
walked
in
again.
Harriet
turned
away;
but
Emma
could
receive
him
with
the
usual
smile,
and
her
quick
eye
soon
discerned
in
his
the
consciousness
of
having
made
a
push
of
having
thrown
a
die;
and
she
imagined
he
was
come
to
see
how
it
might
turn
up.
His
ostensible
reason,
however,
was
to
ask
whether
Mr.
Woodhouse's
party
could
be
made
up
in
the
evening
without
him,
or
whether
he
should
be
in
the
smallest
degree
necessary
at
Hartfield.
If
he
were,
every
thing
else
must
give
way;
but
otherwise
his
friend
Cole
had
been
saying
so
much
about
his
dining
with
him
had
made
such
a
point
of
it,
that
he
had
promised
him
conditionally
to
come.
Emma
thanked
him,
but
could
not
allow
of
his
disappointing
his
friend
on
their
account;
her
father
was
sure
of
his
rubber.
He
re
urged
she
re
declined;
and
he
seemed
then
about
to
make
his
bow,
when
taking
the
paper
from
the
table,
she
returned
it
"Oh!
here
is
the
charade
you
were
so
obliging
as
to
leave
with
us;
thank
you
for
the
sight
of
it.
We
admired
it
so
much,
that
I
have
ventured
to
write
it
into
Miss
Smith's
collection.
Your
friend
will
not
take
it
amiss
I
hope.
Of
course
I
have
not
transcribed
beyond
the
first
eight
lines."
Mr.
Elton
certainly
did
not
very
well
know
what
to
say.
He
looked
rather
doubtingly
rather
confused;
said
something
about
"honour,"
glanced
at
Emma
and
at
Harriet,
and
then
seeing
the
book
open
on
the
table,
took
it
up,
and
examined
it
very
attentively.
With
the
view
of
passing
off
an
awkward
moment,
Emma
smilingly
said,
"You
must
make
my
apologies
to
your
friend;
but
so
good
a
charade
must
not
be
confined
to
one
or
two.
He
may
be
sure
of
every
woman's
approbation
while
he
writes
with
such
gallantry."
"I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying,"
replied
Mr.
Elton,
though
hesitating
a
good
deal
while
he
spoke;
"I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
at
least
if
my
friend
feels
at
all
as
I
do
I
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
that,
could
he
see
his
little
effusion
honoured
as
I
see
it,
(looking
at
the
book
again,
and
replacing
it
on
the
table),
he
would
consider
it
as
the
proudest
moment
of
his
life."
After
this
speech
he
was
gone
as
soon
as
possible.
Emma
could
not
think
it
too
soon;
for
with
all
his
good
and
agreeable
qualities,
there
was
a
sort
of
parade
in
his
speeches
which
was
very
apt
to
incline
her
to
laugh.
She
ran
away
to
indulge
the
inclination,
leaving
the
tender
and
the
sublime
of
pleasure
to
Harriet's
share.
Though
now
the
middle
of
December,
there
had
yet
been
no
weather
to
prevent
the
young
ladies
from
tolerably
regular
exercise;
and
on
the
morrow,
Emma
had
a
charitable
visit
to
pay
to
a
poor
sick
family,
who
lived
a
little
way
out
of
Highbury.
Their
road
to
this
detached
cottage
was
down
Vicarage
Lane,
a
lane
leading
at
right
angles
from
the
broad,
though
irregular,
main
street
of
the
place;
and,
as
may
be
inferred,
containing
the
blessed
abode
of
Mr.
Elton.
A
few
inferior
dwellings
were
first
to
be
passed,
and
then,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
lane
rose
the
Vicarage,
an
old
and
not
very
good
house,
almost
as
close
to
the
road
as
it
could
be.
It
had
no
advantage
of
situation;
but
had
been
very
much
smartened
up
by
the
present
proprietor;
and,
such
as
it
was,
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
the
two
friends
passing
it
without
a
slackened
pace
and
observing
eyes.
Emma's
remark
was
"There
it
is.
There
go
you
and
your
riddle
book
one
of
these
days."
Harriet's
was
"Oh,
what
a
sweet
house!
How
very
beautiful!
There
are
the
yellow
curtains
that
Miss
Nash
admires
so
much."
"I
do
not
often
walk
this
way
now,"
said
Emma,
as
they
proceeded,
"but
