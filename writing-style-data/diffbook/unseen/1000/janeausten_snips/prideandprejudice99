endure.
They
came.
The
family
were
assembled
in
the
breakfast
room
to
receive
them.
Smiles
decked
the
face
of
Mrs.
Bennet
as
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door;
her
husband
looked
impenetrably
grave;
her
daughters,
alarmed,
anxious,
uneasy.
Lydia's
voice
was
heard
in
the
vestibule;
the
door
was
thrown
open,
and
she
ran
into
the
room.
Her
mother
stepped
forwards,
embraced
her,
and
welcomed
her
with
rapture;
gave
her
hand,
with
an
affectionate
smile,
to
Wickham,
who
followed
his
lady;
and
wished
them
both
joy
with
an
alacrity
which
shewed
no
doubt
of
their
happiness.
Their
reception
from
Mr.
Bennet,
to
whom
they
then
turned,
was
not
quite
so
cordial.
His
countenance
rather
gained
in
austerity;
and
he
scarcely
opened
his
lips.
The
easy
assurance
of
the
young
couple,
indeed,
was
enough
to
provoke
him.
Elizabeth
was
disgusted,
and
even
Miss
Bennet
was
shocked.
Lydia
was
Lydia
still;
untamed,
unabashed,
wild,
noisy,
and
fearless.
She
turned
from
sister
to
sister,
demanding
their
congratulations;
and
when
at
length
they
all
sat
down,
looked
eagerly
round
the
room,
took
notice
of
some
little
alteration
in
it,
and
observed,
with
a
laugh,
that
it
was
a
great
while
since
she
had
been
there.
Wickham
was
not
at
all
more
distressed
than
herself,
but
his
manners
were
always
so
pleasing,
that
had
his
character
and
his
marriage
been
exactly
what
they
ought,
his
smiles
and
his
easy
address,
while
he
claimed
their
relationship,
would
have
delighted
them
all.
Elizabeth
had
not
before
believed
him
quite
equal
to
such
assurance;
but
she
sat
down,
resolving
within
herself
to
draw
no
limits
in
future
to
the
impudence
of
an
impudent
man.
She
blushed,
and
Jane
blushed;
but
the
cheeks
of
the
two
who
caused
their
confusion
suffered
no
variation
of
colour.
There
was
no
want
of
discourse.
The
bride
and
her
mother
could
neither
of
them
talk
fast
enough;
and
Wickham,
who
happened
to
sit
near
Elizabeth,
began
inquiring
after
his
acquaintance
in
that
neighbourhood,
with
a
good
humoured
ease
which
she
felt
very
unable
to
equal
in
her
replies.
They
seemed
each
of
them
to
have
the
happiest
memories
in
the
world.
Nothing
of
the
past
was
recollected
with
pain;
and
Lydia
led
voluntarily
to
subjects
which
her
sisters
would
not
have
alluded
to
for
the
world.
"Only
think
of
its
being
three
months,"
she
cried,
"since
I
went
away;
it
seems
but
a
fortnight
I
declare;
and
yet
there
have
been
things
enough
happened
in
the
time.
Good
gracious!
when
I
went
away,
I
am
sure
I
had
no
more
idea
of
being
married
till
I
came
back
again!
though
I
thought
it
would
be
very
good
fun
if
I
was."
Her
father
lifted
up
his
eyes.
Jane
was
distressed.
Elizabeth
looked
expressively
at
Lydia;
but
she,
who
never
heard
nor
saw
anything
of
which
she
chose
to
be
insensible,
gaily
continued,
"Oh!
mamma,
do
the
people
hereabouts
know
I
am
married
to
day?
I
was
afraid
they
might
not;
and
we
overtook
William
Goulding
in
his
curricle,
so
I
was
determined
he
should
know
it,
and
so
I
let
down
the
side
glass
next
to
him,
and
took
off
my
glove,
and
let
my
hand
just
rest
upon
the
window
frame,
so
that
he
might
see
the
ring,
and
then
I
bowed
and
smiled
like
anything."
Elizabeth
could
bear
it
no
longer.
She
got
up,
and
ran
out
of
the
room;
and
returned
no
more,
till
she
heard
them
passing
through
the
hall
to
the
dining
parlour.
She
then
joined
them
soon
enough
to
see
Lydia,
with
anxious
parade,
walk
up
to
her
mother's
right
hand,
and
hear
her
say
to
her
eldest
sister,
"Ah!
Jane,
I
take
your
place
now,
and
you
must
go
lower,
because
I
am
a
married
woman."
It
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
time
would
give
Lydia
that
embarrassment
from
which
she
had
been
so
wholly
free
at
first.
Her
ease
and
good
spirits
increased.
She
longed
to
see
Mrs.
Phillips,
the
Lucases,
and
all
their
other
neighbours,
and
to
hear
herself
called
"Mrs.
Wickham"
by
each
of
them;
and
in
the
mean
time,
she
went
after
dinner
to
show
her
ring,
and
boast
of
being
married,
to
Mrs.
Hill
and
the
two
housemaids.
"Well,
mamma,"
said
she,
when
they
were
all
returned
to
the
breakfast
room,
"and
what
do
you
think
of
my
husband?
Is
not
he
a
charming
man?
I
am
sure
my
sisters
must
all
envy
me.
I
only
hope
they
may
have
half
my
good
luck.
They
must
all
go
to
Brighton.
That
is
the
place
to
get
husbands.
What
a
pity
it
is,
mamma,
we
did
not
all
go."
"Very
true;
and
if
I
had
my
will,
we
should.
But
my
dear
Lydia,
I
don't
at
all
like
your
going
such
a
way
off.
Must
it
be
so?"
"Oh,
lord!
yes;
there
is
nothing
in
that.
I
shall
like
it
of
all
things.
You
and
papa,
and
my
sisters,
must
come
down
and
see
us.
We
shall
be
at
Newcastle
all
the
winter,
and
I
dare
say
there
will
be
some
balls,
and
I
will
take
care
to
get
good
partners
for
them
all."
"I
should
like
it
beyond
anything!"
said
her
mother.
"And
then
when
you
go
away,
you
may
leave
one
or
two
of
my
sisters
behind
you;
and
I
dare
say
I
shall
get
husbands
for
them
before
the
winter
is
over."
"I
thank
you
for
my
share
of
the
favour,"
said
Elizabeth;
"but
I
do
not
particularly
like
your
way
of
getting
husbands."
Their
visitors
were
not
to
remain
above
ten
days
with
them.
Mr.
Wickham
had
received
his
commission
before
he
left
London,
and
he
was
to
join
his
regiment
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight.
No
one
but
Mrs.
Bennet
regretted
that
their
stay
would
be
so
short;
and
she
made
the
most
of
the
time
by
visiting
about
with
her
daughter,
and
having
very
frequent
parties
at
home.
These
parties
were
acceptable
to
all;
