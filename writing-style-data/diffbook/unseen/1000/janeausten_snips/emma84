without
you."
Emma
was
most
happy
to
be
called
to
such
a
council;
and
her
father,
engaging
to
think
it
all
over
while
she
was
gone,
the
two
young
people
set
off
together
without
delay
for
the
Crown.
There
were
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston;
delighted
to
see
her
and
receive
her
approbation,
very
busy
and
very
happy
in
their
different
way;
she,
in
some
little
distress;
and
he,
finding
every
thing
perfect.
"Emma,"
said
she,
"this
paper
is
worse
than
I
expected.
Look!
in
places
you
see
it
is
dreadfully
dirty;
and
the
wainscot
is
more
yellow
and
forlorn
than
any
thing
I
could
have
imagined."
"My
dear,
you
are
too
particular,"
said
her
husband.
"What
does
all
that
signify?
You
will
see
nothing
of
it
by
candlelight.
It
will
be
as
clean
as
Randalls
by
candlelight.
We
never
see
any
thing
of
it
on
our
club
nights."
The
ladies
here
probably
exchanged
looks
which
meant,
"Men
never
know
when
things
are
dirty
or
not;"
and
the
gentlemen
perhaps
thought
each
to
himself,
"Women
will
have
their
little
nonsenses
and
needless
cares."
One
perplexity,
however,
arose,
which
the
gentlemen
did
not
disdain.
It
regarded
a
supper
room.
At
the
time
of
the
ballroom's
being
built,
suppers
had
not
been
in
question;
and
a
small
card
room
adjoining,
was
the
only
addition.
What
was
to
be
done?
This
card
room
would
be
wanted
as
a
card
room
now;
or,
if
cards
were
conveniently
voted
unnecessary
by
their
four
selves,
still
was
it
not
too
small
for
any
comfortable
supper?
Another
room
of
much
better
size
might
be
secured
for
the
purpose;
but
it
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
house,
and
a
long
awkward
passage
must
be
gone
through
to
get
at
it.
This
made
a
difficulty.
Mrs.
Weston
was
afraid
of
draughts
for
the
young
people
in
that
passage;
and
neither
Emma
nor
the
gentlemen
could
tolerate
the
prospect
of
being
miserably
crowded
at
supper.
Mrs.
Weston
proposed
having
no
regular
supper;
merely
sandwiches,
&c.,
set
out
in
the
little
room;
but
that
was
scouted
as
a
wretched
suggestion.
A
private
dance,
without
sitting
down
to
supper,
was
pronounced
an
infamous
fraud
upon
the
rights
of
men
and
women;
and
Mrs.
Weston
must
not
speak
of
it
again.
She
then
took
another
line
of
expediency,
and
looking
into
the
doubtful
room,
observed,
"I
do
not
think
it
is
so
very
small.
We
shall
not
be
many,
you
know."
And
Mr.
Weston
at
the
same
time,
walking
briskly
with
long
steps
through
the
passage,
was
calling
out,
"You
talk
a
great
deal
of
the
length
of
this
passage,
my
dear.
It
is
a
mere
nothing
after
all;
and
not
the
least
draught
from
the
stairs."
"I
wish,"
said
Mrs.
Weston,
"one
could
know
which
arrangement
our
guests
in
general
would
like
best.
To
do
what
would
be
most
generally
pleasing
must
be
our
object
if
one
could
but
tell
what
that
would
be."
"Yes,
very
true,"
cried
Frank,
"very
true.
You
want
your
neighbours'
opinions.
I
do
not
wonder
at
you.
If
one
could
ascertain
what
the
chief
of
them
the
Coles,
for
instance.
They
are
not
far
off.
Shall
I
call
upon
them?
Or
Miss
Bates?
She
is
still
nearer.
And
I
do
not
know
whether
Miss
Bates
is
not
as
likely
to
understand
the
inclinations
of
the
rest
of
the
people
as
any
body.
I
think
we
do
want
a
larger
council.
Suppose
I
go
and
invite
Miss
Bates
to
join
us?"
"Well
if
you
please,"
said
Mrs.
Weston
rather
hesitating,
"if
you
think
she
will
be
of
any
use."
"You
will
get
nothing
to
the
purpose
from
Miss
Bates,"
said
Emma.
"She
will
be
all
delight
and
gratitude,
but
she
will
tell
you
nothing.
She
will
not
even
listen
to
your
questions.
I
see
no
advantage
in
consulting
Miss
Bates."
"But
she
is
so
amusing,
so
extremely
amusing!
I
am
very
fond
of
hearing
Miss
Bates
talk.
And
I
need
not
bring
the
whole
family,
you
know."
Here
Mr.
Weston
joined
them,
and
on
hearing
what
was
proposed,
gave
it
his
decided
approbation.
"Aye,
do,
Frank.
Go
and
fetch
Miss
Bates,
and
let
us
end
the
matter
at
once.
She
will
enjoy
the
scheme,
I
am
sure;
and
I
do
not
know
a
properer
person
for
shewing
us
how
to
do
away
difficulties.
Fetch
Miss
Bates.
We
are
growing
a
little
too
nice.
She
is
a
standing
lesson
of
how
to
be
happy.
But
fetch
them
both.
Invite
them
both."
"Both
sir!
Can
the
old
lady?"...
"The
old
lady!
No,
the
young
lady,
to
be
sure.
I
shall
think
you
a
great
blockhead,
Frank,
if
you
bring
the
aunt
without
the
niece."
"Oh!
I
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
I
did
not
immediately
recollect.
Undoubtedly
if
you
wish
it,
I
will
endeavour
to
persuade
them
both."
And
away
he
ran.
Long
before
he
reappeared,
attending
the
short,
neat,
brisk
moving
aunt,
and
her
elegant
niece,
Mrs.
Weston,
like
a
sweet
tempered
woman
and
a
good
wife,
had
examined
the
passage
again,
and
found
the
evils
of
it
much
less
than
she
had
supposed
before
indeed
very
trifling;
and
here
ended
the
difficulties
of
decision.
All
the
rest,
in
speculation
at
least,
was
perfectly
smooth.
All
the
minor
arrangements
of
table
and
chair,
lights
and
music,
tea
and
supper,
made
themselves;
or
were
left
as
mere
trifles
to
be
settled
at
any
time
between
Mrs.
Weston
and
Mrs.
Stokes.
Every
body
invited,
was
certainly
to
come;
Frank
had
already
written
to
Enscombe
to
propose
staying
a
few
days
beyond
his
fortnight,
which
could
not
possibly
be
refused.
And
a
delightful
dance
it
was
to
be.
Most
cordially,
when
Miss
Bates
arrived,
did
she
agree
that
it
must.
As
a
counsellor
she
was
not
wanted;
but
as
an
approver,
(a
much
safer
character,)
she
was
truly
welcome.
Her
approbation,
at
once
general
and
minute,
warm
and
incessant,
could
not
but
please;
and
for
another
half
hour
they
were
all
walking
