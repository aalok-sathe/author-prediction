always
told
you
he
would
be
here
again
soon,
did
not
I?
Anne,
my
dear,
did
not
I
always
tell
you
so,
and
you
would
not
believe
me?
In
town
next
week,
you
see
at
the
latest,
I
dare
say;
for
she
is
as
impatient
as
the
black
gentleman
when
any
thing
is
to
be
done;
most
likely
they
will
be
there
to
morrow
or
Saturday.
As
to
her
illness,
all
nothing
of
course.
But
it
is
an
excellent
thing
to
have
Frank
among
us
again,
so
near
as
town.
They
will
stay
a
good
while
when
they
do
come,
and
he
will
be
half
his
time
with
us.
This
is
precisely
what
I
wanted.
Well,
pretty
good
news,
is
not
it?
Have
you
finished
it?
Has
Emma
read
it
all?
Put
it
up,
put
it
up;
we
will
have
a
good
talk
about
it
some
other
time,
but
it
will
not
do
now.
I
shall
only
just
mention
the
circumstance
to
the
others
in
a
common
way."
Mrs.
Weston
was
most
comfortably
pleased
on
the
occasion.
Her
looks
and
words
had
nothing
to
restrain
them.
She
was
happy,
she
knew
she
was
happy,
and
knew
she
ought
to
be
happy.
Her
congratulations
were
warm
and
open;
but
Emma
could
not
speak
so
fluently.
She
was
a
little
occupied
in
weighing
her
own
feelings,
and
trying
to
understand
the
degree
of
her
agitation,
which
she
rather
thought
was
considerable.
Mr.
Weston,
however,
too
eager
to
be
very
observant,
too
communicative
to
want
others
to
talk,
was
very
well
satisfied
with
what
she
did
say,
and
soon
moved
away
to
make
the
rest
of
his
friends
happy
by
a
partial
communication
of
what
the
whole
room
must
have
overheard
already.
It
was
well
that
he
took
every
body's
joy
for
granted,
or
he
might
not
have
thought
either
Mr.
Woodhouse
or
Mr.
Knightley
particularly
delighted.
They
were
the
first
entitled,
after
Mrs.
Weston
and
Emma,
to
be
made
happy;
from
them
he
would
have
proceeded
to
Miss
Fairfax,
but
she
was
so
deep
in
conversation
with
John
Knightley,
that
it
would
have
been
too
positive
an
interruption;
and
finding
himself
close
to
Mrs.
Elton,
and
her
attention
disengaged,
he
necessarily
began
on
the
subject
with
her.
"I
hope
I
shall
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
my
son
to
you,"
said
Mr.
Weston.
Mrs.
Elton,
very
willing
to
suppose
a
particular
compliment
intended
her
by
such
a
hope,
smiled
most
graciously.
"You
have
heard
of
a
certain
Frank
Churchill,
I
presume,"
he
continued
"and
know
him
to
be
my
son,
though
he
does
not
bear
my
name."
"Oh!
yes,
and
I
shall
be
very
happy
in
his
acquaintance.
I
am
sure
Mr.
Elton
will
lose
no
time
in
calling
on
him;
and
we
shall
both
have
great
pleasure
in
seeing
him
at
the
Vicarage."
"You
are
very
obliging.
Frank
will
be
extremely
happy,
I
am
sure.
He
is
to
be
in
town
next
week,
if
not
sooner.
We
have
notice
of
it
in
a
letter
to
day.
I
met
the
letters
in
my
way
this
morning,
and
seeing
my
son's
hand,
presumed
to
open
it
though
it
was
not
directed
to
me
it
was
to
Mrs.
Weston.
She
is
his
principal
correspondent,
I
assure
you.
I
hardly
ever
get
a
letter."
"And
so
you
absolutely
opened
what
was
directed
to
her!
Oh!
Mr.
Weston
(laughing
affectedly)
I
must
protest
against
that.
A
most
dangerous
precedent
indeed!
I
beg
you
will
not
let
your
neighbours
follow
your
example.
Upon
my
word,
if
this
is
what
I
am
to
expect,
we
married
women
must
begin
to
exert
ourselves!
Oh!
Mr.
Weston,
I
could
not
have
believed
it
of
you!"
"Aye,
we
men
are
sad
fellows.
You
must
take
care
of
yourself,
Mrs.
Elton.
This
letter
tells
us
it
is
a
short
letter
written
in
a
hurry,
merely
to
give
us
notice
it
tells
us
that
they
are
all
coming
up
to
town
directly,
on
Mrs.
Churchill's
account
she
has
not
been
well
the
whole
winter,
and
thinks
Enscombe
too
cold
for
her
so
they
are
all
to
move
southward
without
loss
of
time."
"Indeed!
from
Yorkshire,
I
think.
Enscombe
is
in
Yorkshire?"
"Yes,
they
are
about
one
hundred
and
ninety
miles
from
London,
a
considerable
journey."
"Yes,
upon
my
word,
very
considerable.
Sixty
five
miles
farther
than
from
Maple
Grove
to
London.
But
what
is
distance,
Mr.
Weston,
to
people
of
large
fortune?
You
would
be
amazed
to
hear
how
my
brother,
Mr.
Suckling,
sometimes
flies
about.
You
will
hardly
believe
me
but
twice
in
one
week
he
and
Mr.
Bragge
went
to
London
and
back
again
with
four
horses."
"The
evil
of
the
distance
from
Enscombe,"
said
Mr.
Weston,
"is,
that
Mrs.
Churchill,
as
we
understand,
has
not
been
able
to
leave
the
sofa
for
a
week
together.
In
Frank's
last
letter
she
complained,
he
said,
of
being
too
weak
to
get
into
her
conservatory
without
having
both
his
arm
and
his
uncle's!
This,
you
know,
speaks
a
great
degree
of
weakness
but
now
she
is
so
impatient
to
be
in
town,
that
she
means
to
sleep
only
two
nights
on
the
road.
So
Frank
writes
word.
Certainly,
delicate
ladies
have
very
extraordinary
constitutions,
Mrs.
Elton.
You
must
grant
me
that."
"No,
indeed,
I
shall
grant
you
nothing.
I
always
take
the
part
of
my
own
sex.
I
do
indeed.
I
give
you
notice
You
will
find
me
a
formidable
antagonist
on
that
point.
I
always
stand
up
for
women
and
I
assure
you,
if
you
knew
how
Selina
feels
with
respect
to
sleeping
at
an
inn,
you
would
not
wonder
at
Mrs.
Churchill's
making
incredible
exertions
to
avoid
it.
Selina
says
it
is
quite
horror
to
her
and
I
believe
I
have
caught
a
little
of
her
nicety.
She
always
travels
with
her
own
sheets;
an
excellent
precaution.
Does
Mrs.
Churchill
do
the
same?"
"Depend
upon
it,
Mrs.
Churchill
does
every
thing
that
any
other
fine
lady
ever
did.
Mrs.
Churchill
