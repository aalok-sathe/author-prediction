to
see
him.
Mrs.
Weston
would
be
at
ease.
The
black
mare
was
blameless;
they
were
right
who
had
named
Mrs.
Churchill
as
the
cause.
He
had
been
detained
by
a
temporary
increase
of
illness
in
her;
a
nervous
seizure,
which
had
lasted
some
hours
and
he
had
quite
given
up
every
thought
of
coming,
till
very
late;
and
had
he
known
how
hot
a
ride
he
should
have,
and
how
late,
with
all
his
hurry,
he
must
be,
he
believed
he
should
not
have
come
at
all.
The
heat
was
excessive;
he
had
never
suffered
any
thing
like
it
almost
wished
he
had
staid
at
home
nothing
killed
him
like
heat
he
could
bear
any
degree
of
cold,
etc.,
but
heat
was
intolerable
and
he
sat
down,
at
the
greatest
possible
distance
from
the
slight
remains
of
Mr.
Woodhouse's
fire,
looking
very
deplorable.
"You
will
soon
be
cooler,
if
you
sit
still,"
said
Emma.
"As
soon
as
I
am
cooler
I
shall
go
back
again.
I
could
very
ill
be
spared
but
such
a
point
had
been
made
of
my
coming!
You
will
all
be
going
soon
I
suppose;
the
whole
party
breaking
up.
I
met
one
as
I
came
Madness
in
such
weather!
absolute
madness!"
Emma
listened,
and
looked,
and
soon
perceived
that
Frank
Churchill's
state
might
be
best
defined
by
the
expressive
phrase
of
being
out
of
humour.
Some
people
were
always
cross
when
they
were
hot.
Such
might
be
his
constitution;
and
as
she
knew
that
eating
and
drinking
were
often
the
cure
of
such
incidental
complaints,
she
recommended
his
taking
some
refreshment;
he
would
find
abundance
of
every
thing
in
the
dining
room
and
she
humanely
pointed
out
the
door.
"No
he
should
not
eat.
He
was
not
hungry;
it
would
only
make
him
hotter."
In
two
minutes,
however,
he
relented
in
his
own
favour;
and
muttering
something
about
spruce
beer,
walked
off.
Emma
returned
all
her
attention
to
her
father,
saying
in
secret
"I
am
glad
I
have
done
being
in
love
with
him.
I
should
not
like
a
man
who
is
so
soon
discomposed
by
a
hot
morning.
Harriet's
sweet
easy
temper
will
not
mind
it."
He
was
gone
long
enough
to
have
had
a
very
comfortable
meal,
and
came
back
all
the
better
grown
quite
cool
and,
with
good
manners,
like
himself
able
to
draw
a
chair
close
to
them,
take
an
interest
in
their
employment;
and
regret,
in
a
reasonable
way,
that
he
should
be
so
late.
He
was
not
in
his
best
spirits,
but
seemed
trying
to
improve
them;
and,
at
last,
made
himself
talk
nonsense
very
agreeably.
They
were
looking
over
views
in
Swisserland.
"As
soon
as
my
aunt
gets
well,
I
shall
go
abroad,"
said
he.
"I
shall
never
be
easy
till
I
have
seen
some
of
these
places.
You
will
have
my
sketches,
some
time
or
other,
to
look
at
or
my
tour
to
read
or
my
poem.
I
shall
do
something
to
expose
myself."
"That
may
be
but
not
by
sketches
in
Swisserland.
You
will
never
go
to
Swisserland.
Your
uncle
and
aunt
will
never
allow
you
to
leave
England."
"They
may
be
induced
to
go
too.
A
warm
climate
may
be
prescribed
for
her.
I
have
more
than
half
an
expectation
of
our
all
going
abroad.
I
assure
you
I
have.
I
feel
a
strong
persuasion,
this
morning,
that
I
shall
soon
be
abroad.
I
ought
to
travel.
I
am
tired
of
doing
nothing.
I
want
a
change.
I
am
serious,
Miss
Woodhouse,
whatever
your
penetrating
eyes
may
fancy
I
am
sick
of
England
and
would
leave
it
to
morrow,
if
I
could."
"You
are
sick
of
prosperity
and
indulgence.
Cannot
you
invent
a
few
hardships
for
yourself,
and
be
contented
to
stay?"
"I
sick
of
prosperity
and
indulgence!
You
are
quite
mistaken.
I
do
not
look
upon
myself
as
either
prosperous
or
indulged.
I
am
thwarted
in
every
thing
material.
I
do
not
consider
myself
at
all
a
fortunate
person."
"You
are
not
quite
so
miserable,
though,
as
when
you
first
came.
Go
and
eat
and
drink
a
little
more,
and
you
will
do
very
well.
Another
slice
of
cold
meat,
another
draught
of
Madeira
and
water,
will
make
you
nearly
on
a
par
with
the
rest
of
us."
"No
I
shall
not
stir.
I
shall
sit
by
you.
You
are
my
best
cure."
"We
are
going
to
Box
Hill
to
morrow;
you
will
join
us.
It
is
not
Swisserland,
but
it
will
be
something
for
a
young
man
so
much
in
want
of
a
change.
You
will
stay,
and
go
with
us?"
"No,
certainly
not;
I
shall
go
home
in
the
cool
of
the
evening."
"But
you
may
come
again
in
the
cool
of
to
morrow
morning."
"No
It
will
not
be
worth
while.
If
I
come,
I
shall
be
cross."
"Then
pray
stay
at
Richmond."
"But
if
I
do,
I
shall
be
crosser
still.
I
can
never
bear
to
think
of
you
all
there
without
me."
"These
are
difficulties
which
you
must
settle
for
yourself.
Chuse
your
own
degree
of
crossness.
I
shall
press
you
no
more."
The
rest
of
the
party
were
now
returning,
and
all
were
soon
collected.
With
some
there
was
great
joy
at
the
sight
of
Frank
Churchill;
others
took
it
very
composedly;
but
there
was
a
very
general
distress
and
disturbance
on
Miss
Fairfax's
disappearance
being
explained.
That
it
was
time
for
every
body
to
go,
concluded
the
subject;
and
with
a
short
final
arrangement
for
the
next
day's
scheme,
they
parted.
Frank
Churchill's
little
inclination
to
exclude
himself
increased
so
much,
that
his
last
words
to
Emma
were,
"Well;
if
you
wish
me
to
stay
and
join
the
party,
I
will."
She
smiled
her
acceptance;
and
nothing
less
than
a
summons
from
Richmond
was
to
take
him
back
before
the
following
evening.
They
had
a
very
fine
day
for
Box
Hill;
and
all
the
other
outward
circumstances
of
arrangement,
accommodation,
and
punctuality,
were
in
favour
of
