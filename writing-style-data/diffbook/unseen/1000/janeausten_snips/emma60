so
quick,
from
the
accidental
rencontre,
to
the
dinner
at
Mr.
Green's,
and
the
party
at
Mrs.
Brown's
smiles
and
blushes
rising
in
importance
with
consciousness
and
agitation
richly
scattered
the
lady
had
been
so
easily
impressed
so
sweetly
disposed
had
in
short,
to
use
a
most
intelligible
phrase,
been
so
very
ready
to
have
him,
that
vanity
and
prudence
were
equally
contented.
He
had
caught
both
substance
and
shadow
both
fortune
and
affection,
and
was
just
the
happy
man
he
ought
to
be;
talking
only
of
himself
and
his
own
concerns
expecting
to
be
congratulated
ready
to
be
laughed
at
and,
with
cordial,
fearless
smiles,
now
addressing
all
the
young
ladies
of
the
place,
to
whom,
a
few
weeks
ago,
he
would
have
been
more
cautiously
gallant.
The
wedding
was
no
distant
event,
as
the
parties
had
only
themselves
to
please,
and
nothing
but
the
necessary
preparations
to
wait
for;
and
when
he
set
out
for
Bath
again,
there
was
a
general
expectation,
which
a
certain
glance
of
Mrs.
Cole's
did
not
seem
to
contradict,
that
when
he
next
entered
Highbury
he
would
bring
his
bride.
During
his
present
short
stay,
Emma
had
barely
seen
him;
but
just
enough
to
feel
that
the
first
meeting
was
over,
and
to
give
her
the
impression
of
his
not
being
improved
by
the
mixture
of
pique
and
pretension,
now
spread
over
his
air.
She
was,
in
fact,
beginning
very
much
to
wonder
that
she
had
ever
thought
him
pleasing
at
all;
and
his
sight
was
so
inseparably
connected
with
some
very
disagreeable
feelings,
that,
except
in
a
moral
light,
as
a
penance,
a
lesson,
a
source
of
profitable
humiliation
to
her
own
mind,
she
would
have
been
thankful
to
be
assured
of
never
seeing
him
again.
She
wished
him
very
well;
but
he
gave
her
pain,
and
his
welfare
twenty
miles
off
would
administer
most
satisfaction.
The
pain
of
his
continued
residence
in
Highbury,
however,
must
certainly
be
lessened
by
his
marriage.
Many
vain
solicitudes
would
be
prevented
many
awkwardnesses
smoothed
by
it.
A
Mrs.
Elton
would
be
an
excuse
for
any
change
of
intercourse;
former
intimacy
might
sink
without
remark.
It
would
be
almost
beginning
their
life
of
civility
again.
Of
the
lady,
individually,
Emma
thought
very
little.
She
was
good
enough
for
Mr.
Elton,
no
doubt;
accomplished
enough
for
Highbury
handsome
enough
to
look
plain,
probably,
by
Harriet's
side.
As
to
connexion,
there
Emma
was
perfectly
easy;
persuaded,
that
after
all
his
own
vaunted
claims
and
disdain
of
Harriet,
he
had
done
nothing.
On
that
article,
truth
seemed
attainable.
What
she
was,
must
be
uncertain;
but
who
she
was,
might
be
found
out;
and
setting
aside
the
10,000
l.,
it
did
not
appear
that
she
was
at
all
Harriet's
superior.
She
brought
no
name,
no
blood,
no
alliance.
Miss
Hawkins
was
the
youngest
of
the
two
daughters
of
a
Bristol
merchant,
of
course,
he
must
be
called;
but,
as
the
whole
of
the
profits
of
his
mercantile
life
appeared
so
very
moderate,
it
was
not
unfair
to
guess
the
dignity
of
his
line
of
trade
had
been
very
moderate
also.
Part
of
every
winter
she
had
been
used
to
spend
in
Bath;
but
Bristol
was
her
home,
the
very
heart
of
Bristol;
for
though
the
father
and
mother
had
died
some
years
ago,
an
uncle
remained
in
the
law
line
nothing
more
distinctly
honourable
was
hazarded
of
him,
than
that
he
was
in
the
law
line;
and
with
him
the
daughter
had
lived.
Emma
guessed
him
to
be
the
drudge
of
some
attorney,
and
too
stupid
to
rise.
And
all
the
grandeur
of
the
connexion
seemed
dependent
on
the
elder
sister,
who
was
very
well
married,
to
a
gentleman
in
a
great
way,
near
Bristol,
who
kept
two
carriages!
That
was
the
wind
up
of
the
history;
that
was
the
glory
of
Miss
Hawkins.
Could
she
but
have
given
Harriet
her
feelings
about
it
all!
She
had
talked
her
into
love;
but,
alas!
she
was
not
so
easily
to
be
talked
out
of
it.
The
charm
of
an
object
to
occupy
the
many
vacancies
of
Harriet's
mind
was
not
to
be
talked
away.
He
might
be
superseded
by
another;
he
certainly
would
indeed;
nothing
could
be
clearer;
even
a
Robert
Martin
would
have
been
sufficient;
but
nothing
else,
she
feared,
would
cure
her.
Harriet
was
one
of
those,
who,
having
once
begun,
would
be
always
in
love.
And
now,
poor
girl!
she
was
considerably
worse
from
this
reappearance
of
Mr.
Elton.
She
was
always
having
a
glimpse
of
him
somewhere
or
other.
Emma
saw
him
only
once;
but
two
or
three
times
every
day
Harriet
was
sure
just
to
meet
with
him,
or
just
to
miss
him,
just
to
hear
his
voice,
or
see
his
shoulder,
just
to
have
something
occur
to
preserve
him
in
her
fancy,
in
all
the
favouring
warmth
of
surprize
and
conjecture.
She
was,
moreover,
perpetually
hearing
about
him;
for,
excepting
when
at
Hartfield,
she
was
always
among
those
who
saw
no
fault
in
Mr.
Elton,
and
found
nothing
so
interesting
as
the
discussion
of
his
concerns;
and
every
report,
therefore,
every
guess
all
that
had
already
occurred,
all
that
might
occur
in
the
arrangement
of
his
affairs,
comprehending
income,
servants,
and
furniture,
was
continually
in
agitation
around
her.
Her
regard
was
receiving
strength
by
invariable
praise
of
him,
and
her
regrets
kept
alive,
and
feelings
irritated
by
ceaseless
repetitions
of
Miss
Hawkins's
happiness,
and
continual
observation
of,
how
much
he
seemed
attached!
his
air
as
he
walked
by
the
house
the
very
sitting
of
his
hat,
being
all
in
proof
of
how
much
he
was
in
love!
Had
it
been
allowable
entertainment,
had
there
been
no
pain
to
her
friend,
or
reproach
to
herself,
in
the
waverings
of
Harriet's
mind,
Emma
would
have
been
amused
by
its
variations.
Sometimes
Mr.
Elton
predominated,
sometimes
the
Martins;
and
each
was
occasionally
useful
as
a
check
to
the
other.
Mr.
Elton's
engagement
had
been
the
cure
of
the
