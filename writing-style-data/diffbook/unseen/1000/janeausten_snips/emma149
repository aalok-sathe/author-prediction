call
for
more
than
a
word
in
passing.
"I
perfectly
agree
with
you,
sir,"
was
then
his
remark.
"You
did
behave
very
shamefully.
You
never
wrote
a
truer
line."
And
having
gone
through
what
immediately
followed
of
the
basis
of
their
disagreement,
and
his
persisting
to
act
in
direct
opposition
to
Jane
Fairfax's
sense
of
right,
he
made
a
fuller
pause
to
say,
"This
is
very
bad.
He
had
induced
her
to
place
herself,
for
his
sake,
in
a
situation
of
extreme
difficulty
and
uneasiness,
and
it
should
have
been
his
first
object
to
prevent
her
from
suffering
unnecessarily.
She
must
have
had
much
more
to
contend
with,
in
carrying
on
the
correspondence,
than
he
could.
He
should
have
respected
even
unreasonable
scruples,
had
there
been
such;
but
hers
were
all
reasonable.
We
must
look
to
her
one
fault,
and
remember
that
she
had
done
a
wrong
thing
in
consenting
to
the
engagement,
to
bear
that
she
should
have
been
in
such
a
state
of
punishment."
Emma
knew
that
he
was
now
getting
to
the
Box
Hill
party,
and
grew
uncomfortable.
Her
own
behaviour
had
been
so
very
improper!
She
was
deeply
ashamed,
and
a
little
afraid
of
his
next
look.
It
was
all
read,
however,
steadily,
attentively,
and
without
the
smallest
remark;
and,
excepting
one
momentary
glance
at
her,
instantly
withdrawn,
in
the
fear
of
giving
pain
no
remembrance
of
Box
Hill
seemed
to
exist.
"There
is
no
saying
much
for
the
delicacy
of
our
good
friends,
the
Eltons,"
was
his
next
observation.
"His
feelings
are
natural.
What!
actually
resolve
to
break
with
him
entirely!
She
felt
the
engagement
to
be
a
source
of
repentance
and
misery
to
each
she
dissolved
it.
What
a
view
this
gives
of
her
sense
of
his
behaviour!
Well,
he
must
be
a
most
extraordinary
"
"Nay,
nay,
read
on.
You
will
find
how
very
much
he
suffers."
"I
hope
he
does,"
replied
Mr.
Knightley
coolly,
and
resuming
the
letter.
"'Smallridge!'
What
does
this
mean?
What
is
all
this?"
"She
had
engaged
to
go
as
governess
to
Mrs.
Smallridge's
children
a
dear
friend
of
Mrs.
Elton's
a
neighbour
of
Maple
Grove;
and,
by
the
bye,
I
wonder
how
Mrs.
Elton
bears
the
disappointment?"
"Say
nothing,
my
dear
Emma,
while
you
oblige
me
to
read
not
even
of
Mrs.
Elton.
Only
one
page
more.
I
shall
soon
have
done.
What
a
letter
the
man
writes!"
"I
wish
you
would
read
it
with
a
kinder
spirit
towards
him."
"Well,
there
is
feeling
here.
He
does
seem
to
have
suffered
in
finding
her
ill.
Certainly,
I
can
have
no
doubt
of
his
being
fond
of
her.
'Dearer,
much
dearer
than
ever.'
I
hope
he
may
long
continue
to
feel
all
the
value
of
such
a
reconciliation.
He
is
a
very
liberal
thanker,
with
his
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands.
'Happier
than
I
deserve.'
Come,
he
knows
himself
there.
'Miss
Woodhouse
calls
me
the
child
of
good
fortune.'
Those
were
Miss
Woodhouse's
words,
were
they?
And
a
fine
ending
and
there
is
the
letter.
The
child
of
good
fortune!
That
was
your
name
for
him,
was
it?"
"You
do
not
appear
so
well
satisfied
with
his
letter
as
I
am;
but
still
you
must,
at
least
I
hope
you
must,
think
the
better
of
him
for
it.
I
hope
it
does
him
some
service
with
you."
"Yes,
certainly
it
does.
He
has
had
great
faults,
faults
of
inconsideration
and
thoughtlessness;
and
I
am
very
much
of
his
opinion
in
thinking
him
likely
to
be
happier
than
he
deserves:
but
still
as
he
is,
beyond
a
doubt,
really
attached
to
Miss
Fairfax,
and
will
soon,
it
may
be
hoped,
have
the
advantage
of
being
constantly
with
her,
I
am
very
ready
to
believe
his
character
will
improve,
and
acquire
from
hers
the
steadiness
and
delicacy
of
principle
that
it
wants.
And
now,
let
me
talk
to
you
of
something
else.
I
have
another
person's
interest
at
present
so
much
at
heart,
that
I
cannot
think
any
longer
about
Frank
Churchill.
Ever
since
I
left
you
this
morning,
Emma,
my
mind
has
been
hard
at
work
on
one
subject."
The
subject
followed;
it
was
in
plain,
unaffected,
gentlemanlike
English,
such
as
Mr.
Knightley
used
even
to
the
woman
he
was
in
love
with,
how
to
be
able
to
ask
her
to
marry
him,
without
attacking
the
happiness
of
her
father.
Emma's
answer
was
ready
at
the
first
word.
"While
her
dear
father
lived,
any
change
of
condition
must
be
impossible
for
her.
She
could
never
quit
him."
Part
only
of
this
answer,
however,
was
admitted.
The
impossibility
of
her
quitting
her
father,
Mr.
Knightley
felt
as
strongly
as
herself;
but
the
inadmissibility
of
any
other
change,
he
could
not
agree
to.
He
had
been
thinking
it
over
most
deeply,
most
intently;
he
had
at
first
hoped
to
induce
Mr.
Woodhouse
to
remove
with
her
to
Donwell;
he
had
wanted
to
believe
it
feasible,
but
his
knowledge
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
not
suffer
him
to
deceive
himself
long;
and
now
he
confessed
his
persuasion,
that
such
a
transplantation
would
be
a
risk
of
her
father's
comfort,
perhaps
even
of
his
life,
which
must
not
be
hazarded.
Mr.
Woodhouse
taken
from
Hartfield!
No,
he
felt
that
it
ought
not
to
be
attempted.
But
the
plan
which
had
arisen
on
the
sacrifice
of
this,
he
trusted
his
dearest
Emma
would
not
find
in
any
respect
objectionable;
it
was,
that
he
should
be
received
at
Hartfield;
that
so
long
as
her
father's
happiness
in
other
words,
his
life
required
Hartfield
to
continue
her
home,
it
should
be
his
likewise.
Of
their
all
removing
to
Donwell,
Emma
had
already
had
her
own
passing
thoughts.
Like
him,
she
had
tried
the
scheme
and
rejected
it;
but
such
an
alternative
as
this
had
not
occurred
to
her.
She
was
sensible
of
all
the
affection
it
evinced.
She
felt
that,
in
quitting
Donwell,
he
must
be
sacrificing
a
great
deal
of
independence
of
hours
and
habits;
that
in
