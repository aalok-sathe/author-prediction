over.
She
could
now
look
forward
to
giving
him
that
full
and
perfect
confidence
which
her
disposition
was
most
ready
to
welcome
as
a
duty.
In
the
gayest
and
happiest
spirits
she
set
forward
with
her
father;
not
always
listening,
but
always
agreeing
to
what
he
said;
and,
whether
in
speech
or
silence,
conniving
at
the
comfortable
persuasion
of
his
being
obliged
to
go
to
Randalls
every
day,
or
poor
Mrs.
Weston
would
be
disappointed.
They
arrived.
Mrs.
Weston
was
alone
in
the
drawing
room:
but
hardly
had
they
been
told
of
the
baby,
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
received
the
thanks
for
coming,
which
he
asked
for,
when
a
glimpse
was
caught
through
the
blind,
of
two
figures
passing
near
the
window.
"It
is
Frank
and
Miss
Fairfax,"
said
Mrs.
Weston.
"I
was
just
going
to
tell
you
of
our
agreeable
surprize
in
seeing
him
arrive
this
morning.
He
stays
till
to
morrow,
and
Miss
Fairfax
has
been
persuaded
to
spend
the
day
with
us.
They
are
coming
in,
I
hope."
In
half
a
minute
they
were
in
the
room.
Emma
was
extremely
glad
to
see
him
but
there
was
a
degree
of
confusion
a
number
of
embarrassing
recollections
on
each
side.
They
met
readily
and
smiling,
but
with
a
consciousness
which
at
first
allowed
little
to
be
said;
and
having
all
sat
down
again,
there
was
for
some
time
such
a
blank
in
the
circle,
that
Emma
began
to
doubt
whether
the
wish
now
indulged,
which
she
had
long
felt,
of
seeing
Frank
Churchill
once
more,
and
of
seeing
him
with
Jane,
would
yield
its
proportion
of
pleasure.
When
Mr.
Weston
joined
the
party,
however,
and
when
the
baby
was
fetched,
there
was
no
longer
a
want
of
subject
or
animation
or
of
courage
and
opportunity
for
Frank
Churchill
to
draw
near
her
and
say,
"I
have
to
thank
you,
Miss
Woodhouse,
for
a
very
kind
forgiving
message
in
one
of
Mrs.
Weston's
letters.
I
hope
time
has
not
made
you
less
willing
to
pardon.
I
hope
you
do
not
retract
what
you
then
said."
"No,
indeed,"
cried
Emma,
most
happy
to
begin,
"not
in
the
least.
I
am
particularly
glad
to
see
and
shake
hands
with
you
and
to
give
you
joy
in
person."
He
thanked
her
with
all
his
heart,
and
continued
some
time
to
speak
with
serious
feeling
of
his
gratitude
and
happiness.
"Is
not
she
looking
well?"
said
he,
turning
his
eyes
towards
Jane.
"Better
than
she
ever
used
to
do?
You
see
how
my
father
and
Mrs.
Weston
doat
upon
her."
But
his
spirits
were
soon
rising
again,
and
with
laughing
eyes,
after
mentioning
the
expected
return
of
the
Campbells,
he
named
the
name
of
Dixon.
Emma
blushed,
and
forbade
its
being
pronounced
in
her
hearing.
"I
can
never
think
of
it,"
she
cried,
"without
extreme
shame."
"The
shame,"
he
answered,
"is
all
mine,
or
ought
to
be.
But
is
it
possible
that
you
had
no
suspicion?
I
mean
of
late.
Early,
I
know,
you
had
none."
"I
never
had
the
smallest,
I
assure
you."
"That
appears
quite
wonderful.
I
was
once
very
near
and
I
wish
I
had
it
would
have
been
better.
But
though
I
was
always
doing
wrong
things,
they
were
very
bad
wrong
things,
and
such
as
did
me
no
service.
It
would
have
been
a
much
better
transgression
had
I
broken
the
bond
of
secrecy
and
told
you
every
thing."
"It
is
not
now
worth
a
regret,"
said
Emma.
"I
have
some
hope,"
resumed
he,
"of
my
uncle's
being
persuaded
to
pay
a
visit
at
Randalls;
he
wants
to
be
introduced
to
her.
When
the
Campbells
are
returned,
we
shall
meet
them
in
London,
and
continue
there,
I
trust,
till
we
may
carry
her
northward.
But
now,
I
am
at
such
a
distance
from
her
is
not
it
hard,
Miss
Woodhouse?
Till
this
morning,
we
have
not
once
met
since
the
day
of
reconciliation.
Do
not
you
pity
me?"
Emma
spoke
her
pity
so
very
kindly,
that
with
a
sudden
accession
of
gay
thought,
he
cried,
"Ah!
by
the
bye,"
then
sinking
his
voice,
and
looking
demure
for
the
moment
"I
hope
Mr.
Knightley
is
well?"
He
paused.
She
coloured
and
laughed.
"I
know
you
saw
my
letter,
and
think
you
may
remember
my
wish
in
your
favour.
Let
me
return
your
congratulations.
I
assure
you
that
I
have
heard
the
news
with
the
warmest
interest
and
satisfaction.
He
is
a
man
whom
I
cannot
presume
to
praise."
Emma
was
delighted,
and
only
wanted
him
to
go
on
in
the
same
style;
but
his
mind
was
the
next
moment
in
his
own
concerns
and
with
his
own
Jane,
and
his
next
words
were,
"Did
you
ever
see
such
a
skin?
such
smoothness!
such
delicacy!
and
yet
without
being
actually
fair.
One
cannot
call
her
fair.
It
is
a
most
uncommon
complexion,
with
her
dark
eye
lashes
and
hair
a
most
distinguishing
complexion!
So
peculiarly
the
lady
in
it.
Just
colour
enough
for
beauty."
"I
have
always
admired
her
complexion,"
replied
Emma,
archly;
"but
do
not
I
remember
the
time
when
you
found
fault
with
her
for
being
so
pale?
When
we
first
began
to
talk
of
her.
Have
you
quite
forgotten?"
"Oh!
no
what
an
impudent
dog
I
was!
How
could
I
dare
"
But
he
laughed
so
heartily
at
the
recollection,
that
Emma
could
not
help
saying,
"I
do
suspect
that
in
the
midst
of
your
perplexities
at
that
time,
you
had
very
great
amusement
in
tricking
us
all.
I
am
sure
you
had.
I
am
sure
it
was
a
consolation
to
you."
"Oh!
no,
no,
no
how
can
you
suspect
me
of
such
a
thing?
I
was
the
most
miserable
wretch!"
"Not
quite
so
miserable
as
to
be
insensible
to
mirth.
I
am
sure
it
was
a
source
of
high
entertainment
to
you,
to
feel
that
you
were
taking
us
all
in.
Perhaps
I
am
the
readier
to
suspect,
because,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
I
think
it
