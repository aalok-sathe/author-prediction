direction,
may
be
of
service,
if
not
to
himself,
to
many
others,
for
it
must
only
deter
him
from
such
foul
misconduct
as
I
have
suffered
by.
I
only
fear
that
the
sort
of
cautiousness
to
which
you,
I
imagine,
have
been
alluding,
is
merely
adopted
on
his
visits
to
his
aunt,
of
whose
good
opinion
and
judgement
he
stands
much
in
awe.
His
fear
of
her
has
always
operated,
I
know,
when
they
were
together;
and
a
good
deal
is
to
be
imputed
to
his
wish
of
forwarding
the
match
with
Miss
de
Bourgh,
which
I
am
certain
he
has
very
much
at
heart."
Elizabeth
could
not
repress
a
smile
at
this,
but
she
answered
only
by
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head.
She
saw
that
he
wanted
to
engage
her
on
the
old
subject
of
his
grievances,
and
she
was
in
no
humour
to
indulge
him.
The
rest
of
the
evening
passed
with
the
appearance,
on
his
side,
of
usual
cheerfulness,
but
with
no
further
attempt
to
distinguish
Elizabeth;
and
they
parted
at
last
with
mutual
civility,
and
possibly
a
mutual
desire
of
never
meeting
again.
When
the
party
broke
up,
Lydia
returned
with
Mrs.
Forster
to
Meryton,
from
whence
they
were
to
set
out
early
the
next
morning.
The
separation
between
her
and
her
family
was
rather
noisy
than
pathetic.
Kitty
was
the
only
one
who
shed
tears;
but
she
did
weep
from
vexation
and
envy.
Mrs.
Bennet
was
diffuse
in
her
good
wishes
for
the
felicity
of
her
daughter,
and
impressive
in
her
injunctions
that
she
should
not
miss
the
opportunity
of
enjoying
herself
as
much
as
possible
advice
which
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
would
be
well
attended
to;
and
in
the
clamorous
happiness
of
Lydia
herself
in
bidding
farewell,
the
more
gentle
adieus
of
her
sisters
were
uttered
without
being
heard.
Had
Elizabeth's
opinion
been
all
drawn
from
her
own
family,
she
could
not
have
formed
a
very
pleasing
opinion
of
conjugal
felicity
or
domestic
comfort.
Her
father,
captivated
by
youth
and
beauty,
and
that
appearance
of
good
humour
which
youth
and
beauty
generally
give,
had
married
a
woman
whose
weak
understanding
and
illiberal
mind
had
very
early
in
their
marriage
put
an
end
to
all
real
affection
for
her.
Respect,
esteem,
and
confidence
had
vanished
for
ever;
and
all
his
views
of
domestic
happiness
were
overthrown.
But
Mr.
Bennet
was
not
of
a
disposition
to
seek
comfort
for
the
disappointment
which
his
own
imprudence
had
brought
on,
in
any
of
those
pleasures
which
too
often
console
the
unfortunate
for
their
folly
or
their
vice.
He
was
fond
of
the
country
and
of
books;
and
from
these
tastes
had
arisen
his
principal
enjoyments.
To
his
wife
he
was
very
little
otherwise
indebted,
than
as
her
ignorance
and
folly
had
contributed
to
his
amusement.
This
is
not
the
sort
of
happiness
which
a
man
would
in
general
wish
to
owe
to
his
wife;
but
where
other
powers
of
entertainment
are
wanting,
the
true
philosopher
will
derive
benefit
from
such
as
are
given.
Elizabeth,
however,
had
never
been
blind
to
the
impropriety
of
her
father's
behaviour
as
a
husband.
She
had
always
seen
it
with
pain;
but
respecting
his
abilities,
and
grateful
for
his
affectionate
treatment
of
herself,
she
endeavoured
to
forget
what
she
could
not
overlook,
and
to
banish
from
her
thoughts
that
continual
breach
of
conjugal
obligation
and
decorum
which,
in
exposing
his
wife
to
the
contempt
of
her
own
children,
was
so
highly
reprehensible.
But
she
had
never
felt
so
strongly
as
now
the
disadvantages
which
must
attend
the
children
of
so
unsuitable
a
marriage,
nor
ever
been
so
fully
aware
of
the
evils
arising
from
so
ill
judged
a
direction
of
talents;
talents,
which,
rightly
used,
might
at
least
have
preserved
the
respectability
of
his
daughters,
even
if
incapable
of
enlarging
the
mind
of
his
wife.
When
Elizabeth
had
rejoiced
over
Wickham's
departure
she
found
little
other
cause
for
satisfaction
in
the
loss
of
the
regiment.
Their
parties
abroad
were
less
varied
than
before,
and
at
home
she
had
a
mother
and
sister
whose
constant
repinings
at
the
dullness
of
everything
around
them
threw
a
real
gloom
over
their
domestic
circle;
and,
though
Kitty
might
in
time
regain
her
natural
degree
of
sense,
since
the
disturbers
of
her
brain
were
removed,
her
other
sister,
from
whose
disposition
greater
evil
might
be
apprehended,
was
likely
to
be
hardened
in
all
her
folly
and
assurance
by
a
situation
of
such
double
danger
as
a
watering
place
and
a
camp.
Upon
the
whole,
therefore,
she
found,
what
has
been
sometimes
found
before,
that
an
event
to
which
she
had
been
looking
with
impatient
desire
did
not,
in
taking
place,
bring
all
the
satisfaction
she
had
promised
herself.
It
was
consequently
necessary
to
name
some
other
period
for
the
commencement
of
actual
felicity
to
have
some
other
point
on
which
her
wishes
and
hopes
might
be
fixed,
and
by
again
enjoying
the
pleasure
of
anticipation,
console
herself
for
the
present,
and
prepare
for
another
disappointment.
Her
tour
to
the
Lakes
was
now
the
object
of
her
happiest
thoughts;
it
was
her
best
consolation
for
all
the
uncomfortable
hours
which
the
discontentedness
of
her
mother
and
Kitty
made
inevitable;
and
could
she
have
included
Jane
in
the
scheme,
every
part
of
it
would
have
been
perfect.
"But
it
is
fortunate,"
thought
she,
"that
I
have
something
to
wish
for.
Were
the
whole
arrangement
complete,
my
disappointment
would
be
certain.
But
here,
by
carrying
with
me
one
ceaseless
source
of
regret
in
my
sister's
absence,
I
may
reasonably
hope
to
have
all
my
expectations
of
pleasure
realised.
A
scheme
of
which
every
part
promises
delight
can
never
be
successful;
and
general
disappointment
is
only
warded
off
by
the
defence
of
some
little
peculiar
vexation."
When
Lydia
went
away
she
promised
to
write
very
often
and
very
minutely
to
her
mother
and
Kitty;
but
her
letters
were
always
long
expected,
and
always
very
short.
Those

her
mother
