and
Emma
received
a
smile
which
seemed
to
say,
"These
are
my
own
concerns.
I
have
a
right
to
talk
on
such
subjects,
without
being
suspected
of
introducing
Robert
Martin."
She
did
not
suspect
him.
It
was
too
old
a
story.
Robert
Martin
had
probably
ceased
to
think
of
Harriet.
They
took
a
few
turns
together
along
the
walk.
The
shade
was
most
refreshing,
and
Emma
found
it
the
pleasantest
part
of
the
day.
The
next
remove
was
to
the
house;
they
must
all
go
in
and
eat;
and
they
were
all
seated
and
busy,
and
still
Frank
Churchill
did
not
come.
Mrs.
Weston
looked,
and
looked
in
vain.
His
father
would
not
own
himself
uneasy,
and
laughed
at
her
fears;
but
she
could
not
be
cured
of
wishing
that
he
would
part
with
his
black
mare.
He
had
expressed
himself
as
to
coming,
with
more
than
common
certainty.
"His
aunt
was
so
much
better,
that
he
had
not
a
doubt
of
getting
over
to
them."
Mrs.
Churchill's
state,
however,
as
many
were
ready
to
remind
her,
was
liable
to
such
sudden
variation
as
might
disappoint
her
nephew
in
the
most
reasonable
dependence
and
Mrs.
Weston
was
at
last
persuaded
to
believe,
or
to
say,
that
it
must
be
by
some
attack
of
Mrs.
Churchill
that
he
was
prevented
coming.
Emma
looked
at
Harriet
while
the
point
was
under
consideration;
she
behaved
very
well,
and
betrayed
no
emotion.
The
cold
repast
was
over,
and
the
party
were
to
go
out
once
more
to
see
what
had
not
yet
been
seen,
the
old
Abbey
fish
ponds;
perhaps
get
as
far
as
the
clover,
which
was
to
be
begun
cutting
on
the
morrow,
or,
at
any
rate,
have
the
pleasure
of
being
hot,
and
growing
cool
again.
Mr.
Woodhouse,
who
had
already
taken
his
little
round
in
the
highest
part
of
the
gardens,
where
no
damps
from
the
river
were
imagined
even
by
him,
stirred
no
more;
and
his
daughter
resolved
to
remain
with
him,
that
Mrs.
Weston
might
be
persuaded
away
by
her
husband
to
the
exercise
and
variety
which
her
spirits
seemed
to
need.
Mr.
Knightley
had
done
all
in
his
power
for
Mr.
Woodhouse's
entertainment.
Books
of
engravings,
drawers
of
medals,
cameos,
corals,
shells,
and
every
other
family
collection
within
his
cabinets,
had
been
prepared
for
his
old
friend,
to
while
away
the
morning;
and
the
kindness
had
perfectly
answered.
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
been
exceedingly
well
amused.
Mrs.
Weston
had
been
shewing
them
all
to
him,
and
now
he
would
shew
them
all
to
Emma;
fortunate
in
having
no
other
resemblance
to
a
child,
than
in
a
total
want
of
taste
for
what
he
saw,
for
he
was
slow,
constant,
and
methodical.
Before
this
second
looking
over
was
begun,
however,
Emma
walked
into
the
hall
for
the
sake
of
a
few
moments'
free
observation
of
the
entrance
and
ground
plot
of
the
house
and
was
hardly
there,
when
Jane
Fairfax
appeared,
coming
quickly
in
from
the
garden,
and
with
a
look
of
escape.
Little
expecting
to
meet
Miss
Woodhouse
so
soon,
there
was
a
start
at
first;
but
Miss
Woodhouse
was
the
very
person
she
was
in
quest
of.
"Will
you
be
so
kind,"
said
she,
"when
I
am
missed,
as
to
say
that
I
am
gone
home?
I
am
going
this
moment.
My
aunt
is
not
aware
how
late
it
is,
nor
how
long
we
have
been
absent
but
I
am
sure
we
shall
be
wanted,
and
I
am
determined
to
go
directly.
I
have
said
nothing
about
it
to
any
body.
It
would
only
be
giving
trouble
and
distress.
Some
are
gone
to
the
ponds,
and
some
to
the
lime
walk.
Till
they
all
come
in
I
shall
not
be
missed;
and
when
they
do,
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
say
that
I
am
gone?"
"Certainly,
if
you
wish
it;
but
you
are
not
going
to
walk
to
Highbury
alone?"
"Yes
what
should
hurt
me?
I
walk
fast.
I
shall
be
at
home
in
twenty
minutes."
"But
it
is
too
far,
indeed
it
is,
to
be
walking
quite
alone.
Let
my
father's
servant
go
with
you.
Let
me
order
the
carriage.
It
can
be
round
in
five
minutes."
"Thank
you,
thank
you
but
on
no
account.
I
would
rather
walk.
And
for
me
to
be
afraid
of
walking
alone!
I,
who
may
so
soon
have
to
guard
others!"
She
spoke
with
great
agitation;
and
Emma
very
feelingly
replied,
"That
can
be
no
reason
for
your
being
exposed
to
danger
now.
I
must
order
the
carriage.
The
heat
even
would
be
danger.
You
are
fatigued
already."
"I
am,"
she
answered
"I
am
fatigued;
but
it
is
not
the
sort
of
fatigue
quick
walking
will
refresh
me.
Miss
Woodhouse,
we
all
know
at
times
what
it
is
to
be
wearied
in
spirits.
Mine,
I
confess,
are
exhausted.
The
greatest
kindness
you
can
shew
me,
will
be
to
let
me
have
my
own
way,
and
only
say
that
I
am
gone
when
it
is
necessary."
Emma
had
not
another
word
to
oppose.
She
saw
it
all;
and
entering
into
her
feelings,
promoted
her
quitting
the
house
immediately,
and
watched
her
safely
off
with
the
zeal
of
a
friend.
Her
parting
look
was
grateful
and
her
parting
words,
"Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
the
comfort
of
being
sometimes
alone!"
seemed
to
burst
from
an
overcharged
heart,
and
to
describe
somewhat
of
the
continual
endurance
to
be
practised
by
her,
even
towards
some
of
those
who
loved
her
best.
"Such
a
home,
indeed!
such
an
aunt!"
said
Emma,
as
she
turned
back
into
the
hall
again.
"I
do
pity
you.
And
the
more
sensibility
you
betray
of
their
just
horrors,
the
more
I
shall
like
you."
Jane
had
not
been
gone
a
quarter
of
an
hour,
and
they
had
only
accomplished
some
views
of
St.
Mark's
Place,
Venice,
when
Frank
Churchill
entered
the
room.
Emma
had
not
been
thinking
of
him,
she
had
forgotten
to
think
of
him
but
she
was
very
glad
