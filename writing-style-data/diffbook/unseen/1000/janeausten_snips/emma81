have
you
all
meet
so!
Our
little
room
so
honoured!"
She
was
in
the
adjoining
chamber
while
she
still
spoke,
and
opening
the
casement
there,
immediately
called
Mr.
Knightley's
attention,
and
every
syllable
of
their
conversation
was
as
distinctly
heard
by
the
others,
as
if
it
had
passed
within
the
same
apartment.
"How
d'
ye
do?
how
d'ye
do?
Very
well,
I
thank
you.
So
obliged
to
you
for
the
carriage
last
night.
We
were
just
in
time;
my
mother
just
ready
for
us.
Pray
come
in;
do
come
in.
You
will
find
some
friends
here."
So
began
Miss
Bates;
and
Mr.
Knightley
seemed
determined
to
be
heard
in
his
turn,
for
most
resolutely
and
commandingly
did
he
say,
"How
is
your
niece,
Miss
Bates?
I
want
to
inquire
after
you
all,
but
particularly
your
niece.
How
is
Miss
Fairfax?
I
hope
she
caught
no
cold
last
night.
How
is
she
to
day?
Tell
me
how
Miss
Fairfax
is."
And
Miss
Bates
was
obliged
to
give
a
direct
answer
before
he
would
hear
her
in
any
thing
else.
The
listeners
were
amused;
and
Mrs.
Weston
gave
Emma
a
look
of
particular
meaning.
But
Emma
still
shook
her
head
in
steady
scepticism.
"So
obliged
to
you!
so
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
carriage,"
resumed
Miss
Bates.
He
cut
her
short
with,
"I
am
going
to
Kingston.
Can
I
do
any
thing
for
you?"
"Oh!
dear,
Kingston
are
you?
Mrs.
Cole
was
saying
the
other
day
she
wanted
something
from
Kingston."
"Mrs.
Cole
has
servants
to
send.
Can
I
do
any
thing
for
you?"
"No,
I
thank
you.
But
do
come
in.
Who
do
you
think
is
here?
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Miss
Smith;
so
kind
as
to
call
to
hear
the
new
pianoforte.
Do
put
up
your
horse
at
the
Crown,
and
come
in."
"Well,"
said
he,
in
a
deliberating
manner,
"for
five
minutes,
perhaps."
"And
here
is
Mrs.
Weston
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
too!
Quite
delightful;
so
many
friends!"
"No,
not
now,
I
thank
you.
I
could
not
stay
two
minutes.
I
must
get
on
to
Kingston
as
fast
as
I
can."
"Oh!
do
come
in.
They
will
be
so
very
happy
to
see
you."
"No,
no;
your
room
is
full
enough.
I
will
call
another
day,
and
hear
the
pianoforte."
"Well,
I
am
so
sorry!
Oh!
Mr.
Knightley,
what
a
delightful
party
last
night;
how
extremely
pleasant.
Did
you
ever
see
such
dancing?
Was
not
it
delightful?
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill;
I
never
saw
any
thing
equal
to
it."
"Oh!
very
delightful
indeed;
I
can
say
nothing
less,
for
I
suppose
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
are
hearing
every
thing
that
passes.
And
(raising
his
voice
still
more)
I
do
not
see
why
Miss
Fairfax
should
not
be
mentioned
too.
I
think
Miss
Fairfax
dances
very
well;
and
Mrs.
Weston
is
the
very
best
country
dance
player,
without
exception,
in
England.
Now,
if
your
friends
have
any
gratitude,
they
will
say
something
pretty
loud
about
you
and
me
in
return;
but
I
cannot
stay
to
hear
it."
"Oh!
Mr.
Knightley,
one
moment
more;
something
of
consequence
so
shocked!
Jane
and
I
are
both
so
shocked
about
the
apples!"
"What
is
the
matter
now?"
"To
think
of
your
sending
us
all
your
store
apples.
You
said
you
had
a
great
many,
and
now
you
have
not
one
left.
We
really
are
so
shocked!
Mrs.
Hodges
may
well
be
angry.
William
Larkins
mentioned
it
here.
You
should
not
have
done
it,
indeed
you
should
not.
Ah!
he
is
off.
He
never
can
bear
to
be
thanked.
But
I
thought
he
would
have
staid
now,
and
it
would
have
been
a
pity
not
to
have
mentioned....
Well,
(returning
to
the
room,)
I
have
not
been
able
to
succeed.
Mr.
Knightley
cannot
stop.
He
is
going
to
Kingston.
He
asked
me
if
he
could
do
any
thing...."
"Yes,"
said
Jane,
"we
heard
his
kind
offers,
we
heard
every
thing."
"Oh!
yes,
my
dear,
I
dare
say
you
might,
because
you
know,
the
door
was
open,
and
the
window
was
open,
and
Mr.
Knightley
spoke
loud.
You
must
have
heard
every
thing
to
be
sure.
'Can
I
do
any
thing
for
you
at
Kingston?'
said
he;
so
I
just
mentioned....
Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
must
you
be
going?
You
seem
but
just
come
so
very
obliging
of
you."
Emma
found
it
really
time
to
be
at
home;
the
visit
had
already
lasted
long;
and
on
examining
watches,
so
much
of
the
morning
was
perceived
to
be
gone,
that
Mrs.
Weston
and
her
companion
taking
leave
also,
could
allow
themselves
only
to
walk
with
the
two
young
ladies
to
Hartfield
gates,
before
they
set
off
for
Randalls.
It
may
be
possible
to
do
without
dancing
entirely.
Instances
have
been
known
of
young
people
passing
many,
many
months
successively,
without
being
at
any
ball
of
any
description,
and
no
material
injury
accrue
either
to
body
or
mind;
but
when
a
beginning
is
made
when
the
felicities
of
rapid
motion
have
once
been,
though
slightly,
felt
it
must
be
a
very
heavy
set
that
does
not
ask
for
more.
Frank
Churchill
had
danced
once
at
Highbury,
and
longed
to
dance
again;
and
the
last
half
hour
of
an
evening
which
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
persuaded
to
spend
with
his
daughter
at
Randalls,
was
passed
by
the
two
young
people
in
schemes
on
the
subject.
Frank's
was
the
first
idea;
and
his
the
greatest
zeal
in
pursuing
it;
for
the
lady
was
the
best
judge
of
the
difficulties,
and
the
most
solicitous
for
accommodation
and
appearance.
But
still
she
had
inclination
enough
for
shewing
people
again
how
delightfully
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Woodhouse
danced
for
doing
that
in
which
she
need
not
blush
to
compare
herself
with
Jane
Fairfax
and
even
for
simple
dancing
itself,
without
any
of
the
wicked
aids
of
vanity
to
assist
him
first
in
pacing
out
the
room
they
were
in
to
see
what
it
could
be
made
to
hold
and
