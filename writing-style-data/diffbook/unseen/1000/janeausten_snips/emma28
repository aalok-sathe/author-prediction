then
there
will
be
an
inducement,
and
I
shall
gradually
get
intimately
acquainted
with
all
the
hedges,
gates,
pools
and
pollards
of
this
part
of
Highbury."
Harriet,
she
found,
had
never
in
her
life
been
inside
the
Vicarage,
and
her
curiosity
to
see
it
was
so
extreme,
that,
considering
exteriors
and
probabilities,
Emma
could
only
class
it,
as
a
proof
of
love,
with
Mr.
Elton's
seeing
ready
wit
in
her.
"I
wish
we
could
contrive
it,"
said
she;
"but
I
cannot
think
of
any
tolerable
pretence
for
going
in;
no
servant
that
I
want
to
inquire
about
of
his
housekeeper
no
message
from
my
father."
She
pondered,
but
could
think
of
nothing.
After
a
mutual
silence
of
some
minutes,
Harriet
thus
began
again
"I
do
so
wonder,
Miss
Woodhouse,
that
you
should
not
be
married,
or
going
to
be
married!
so
charming
as
you
are!"
Emma
laughed,
and
replied,
"My
being
charming,
Harriet,
is
not
quite
enough
to
induce
me
to
marry;
I
must
find
other
people
charming
one
other
person
at
least.
And
I
am
not
only,
not
going
to
be
married,
at
present,
but
have
very
little
intention
of
ever
marrying
at
all."
"Ah!
so
you
say;
but
I
cannot
believe
it."
"I
must
see
somebody
very
superior
to
any
one
I
have
seen
yet,
to
be
tempted;
Mr.
Elton,
you
know,
(recollecting
herself,)
is
out
of
the
question:
and
I
do
not
wish
to
see
any
such
person.
I
would
rather
not
be
tempted.
I
cannot
really
change
for
the
better.
If
I
were
to
marry,
I
must
expect
to
repent
it."
"Dear
me!
it
is
so
odd
to
hear
a
woman
talk
so!"
"I
have
none
of
the
usual
inducements
of
women
to
marry.
Were
I
to
fall
in
love,
indeed,
it
would
be
a
different
thing!
but
I
never
have
been
in
love;
it
is
not
my
way,
or
my
nature;
and
I
do
not
think
I
ever
shall.
And,
without
love,
I
am
sure
I
should
be
a
fool
to
change
such
a
situation
as
mine.
Fortune
I
do
not
want;
employment
I
do
not
want;
consequence
I
do
not
want:
I
believe
few
married
women
are
half
as
much
mistress
of
their
husband's
house
as
I
am
of
Hartfield;
and
never,
never
could
I
expect
to
be
so
truly
beloved
and
important;
so
always
first
and
always
right
in
any
man's
eyes
as
I
am
in
my
father's."
"But
then,
to
be
an
old
maid
at
last,
like
Miss
Bates!"
"That
is
as
formidable
an
image
as
you
could
present,
Harriet;
and
if
I
thought
I
should
ever
be
like
Miss
Bates!
so
silly
so
satisfied
so
smiling
so
prosing
so
undistinguishing
and
unfastidious
and
so
apt
to
tell
every
thing
relative
to
every
body
about
me,
I
would
marry
to
morrow.
But
between
us,
I
am
convinced
there
never
can
be
any
likeness,
except
in
being
unmarried."
"But
still,
you
will
be
an
old
maid!
and
that's
so
dreadful!"
"Never
mind,
Harriet,
I
shall
not
be
a
poor
old
maid;
and
it
is
poverty
only
which
makes
celibacy
contemptible
to
a
generous
public!
A
single
woman,
with
a
very
narrow
income,
must
be
a
ridiculous,
disagreeable
old
maid!
the
proper
sport
of
boys
and
girls,
but
a
single
woman,
of
good
fortune,
is
always
respectable,
and
may
be
as
sensible
and
pleasant
as
any
body
else.
And
the
distinction
is
not
quite
so
much
against
the
candour
and
common
sense
of
the
world
as
appears
at
first;
for
a
very
narrow
income
has
a
tendency
to
contract
the
mind,
and
sour
the
temper.
Those
who
can
barely
live,
and
who
live
perforce
in
a
very
small,
and
generally
very
inferior,
society,
may
well
be
illiberal
and
cross.
This
does
not
apply,
however,
to
Miss
Bates;
she
is
only
too
good
natured
and
too
silly
to
suit
me;
but,
in
general,
she
is
very
much
to
the
taste
of
every
body,
though
single
and
though
poor.
Poverty
certainly
has
not
contracted
her
mind:
I
really
believe,
if
she
had
only
a
shilling
in
the
world,
she
would
be
very
likely
to
give
away
sixpence
of
it;
and
nobody
is
afraid
of
her:
that
is
a
great
charm."
"Dear
me!
but
what
shall
you
do?
how
shall
you
employ
yourself
when
you
grow
old?"
"If
I
know
myself,
Harriet,
mine
is
an
active,
busy
mind,
with
a
great
many
independent
resources;
and
I
do
not
perceive
why
I
should
be
more
in
want
of
employment
at
forty
or
fifty
than
one
and
twenty.
Woman's
usual
occupations
of
hand
and
mind
will
be
as
open
to
me
then
as
they
are
now;
or
with
no
important
variation.
If
I
draw
less,
I
shall
read
more;
if
I
give
up
music,
I
shall
take
to
carpet
work.
And
as
for
objects
of
interest,
objects
for
the
affections,
which
is
in
truth
the
great
point
of
inferiority,
the
want
of
which
is
really
the
great
evil
to
be
avoided
in
not
marrying,
I
shall
be
very
well
off,
with
all
the
children
of
a
sister
I
love
so
much,
to
care
about.
There
will
be
enough
of
them,
in
all
probability,
to
supply
every
sort
of
sensation
that
declining
life
can
need.
There
will
be
enough
for
every
hope
and
every
fear;
and
though
my
attachment
to
none
can
equal
that
of
a
parent,
it
suits
my
ideas
of
comfort
better
than
what
is
warmer
and
blinder.
My
nephews
and
nieces!
I
shall
often
have
a
niece
with
me."
"Do
you
know
Miss
Bates's
niece?
That
is,
I
know
you
must
have
seen
her
a
hundred
times
but
are
you
acquainted?"
"Oh!
yes;
we
are
always
forced
to
be
acquainted
whenever
she
comes
to
Highbury.
By
the
bye,
that
is
almost
enough
to
put
one
out
of
conceit
with
a
niece.
Heaven
forbid!
at
least,
that
I
should
ever
bore
people
half
so
much
about
all
the
Knightleys
together,
as
she
does
about
Jane
Fairfax.
