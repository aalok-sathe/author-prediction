oftener
than
Emma
could
have
supposed.
Some
of
the
objects
of
his
curiosity
spoke
very
amiable
feelings.
He
begged
to
be
shewn
the
house
which
his
father
had
lived
in
so
long,
and
which
had
been
the
home
of
his
father's
father;
and
on
recollecting
that
an
old
woman
who
had
nursed
him
was
still
living,
walked
in
quest
of
her
cottage
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other;
and
though
in
some
points
of
pursuit
or
observation
there
was
no
positive
merit,
they
shewed,
altogether,
a
good
will
towards
Highbury
in
general,
which
must
be
very
like
a
merit
to
those
he
was
with.
Emma
watched
and
decided,
that
with
such
feelings
as
were
now
shewn,
it
could
not
be
fairly
supposed
that
he
had
been
ever
voluntarily
absenting
himself;
that
he
had
not
been
acting
a
part,
or
making
a
parade
of
insincere
professions;
and
that
Mr.
Knightley
certainly
had
not
done
him
justice.
Their
first
pause
was
at
the
Crown
Inn,
an
inconsiderable
house,
though
the
principal
one
of
the
sort,
where
a
couple
of
pair
of
post
horses
were
kept,
more
for
the
convenience
of
the
neighbourhood
than
from
any
run
on
the
road;
and
his
companions
had
not
expected
to
be
detained
by
any
interest
excited
there;
but
in
passing
it
they
gave
the
history
of
the
large
room
visibly
added;
it
had
been
built
many
years
ago
for
a
ball
room,
and
while
the
neighbourhood
had
been
in
a
particularly
populous,
dancing
state,
had
been
occasionally
used
as
such;
but
such
brilliant
days
had
long
passed
away,
and
now
the
highest
purpose
for
which
it
was
ever
wanted
was
to
accommodate
a
whist
club
established
among
the
gentlemen
and
half
gentlemen
of
the
place.
He
was
immediately
interested.
Its
character
as
a
ball
room
caught
him;
and
instead
of
passing
on,
he
stopt
for
several
minutes
at
the
two
superior
sashed
windows
which
were
open,
to
look
in
and
contemplate
its
capabilities,
and
lament
that
its
original
purpose
should
have
ceased.
He
saw
no
fault
in
the
room,
he
would
acknowledge
none
which
they
suggested.
No,
it
was
long
enough,
broad
enough,
handsome
enough.
It
would
hold
the
very
number
for
comfort.
They
ought
to
have
balls
there
at
least
every
fortnight
through
the
winter.
Why
had
not
Miss
Woodhouse
revived
the
former
good
old
days
of
the
room?
She
who
could
do
any
thing
in
Highbury!
The
want
of
proper
families
in
the
place,
and
the
conviction
that
none
beyond
the
place
and
its
immediate
environs
could
be
tempted
to
attend,
were
mentioned;
but
he
was
not
satisfied.
He
could
not
be
persuaded
that
so
many
good
looking
houses
as
he
saw
around
him,
could
not
furnish
numbers
enough
for
such
a
meeting;
and
even
when
particulars
were
given
and
families
described,
he
was
still
unwilling
to
admit
that
the
inconvenience
of
such
a
mixture
would
be
any
thing,
or
that
there
would
be
the
smallest
difficulty
in
every
body's
returning
into
their
proper
place
the
next
morning.
He
argued
like
a
young
man
very
much
bent
on
dancing;
and
Emma
was
rather
surprized
to
see
the
constitution
of
the
Weston
prevail
so
decidedly
against
the
habits
of
the
Churchills.
He
seemed
to
have
all
the
life
and
spirit,
cheerful
feelings,
and
social
inclinations
of
his
father,
and
nothing
of
the
pride
or
reserve
of
Enscombe.
Of
pride,
indeed,
there
was,
perhaps,
scarcely
enough;
his
indifference
to
a
confusion
of
rank,
bordered
too
much
on
inelegance
of
mind.
He
could
be
no
judge,
however,
of
the
evil
he
was
holding
cheap.
It
was
but
an
effusion
of
lively
spirits.
At
last
he
was
persuaded
to
move
on
from
the
front
of
the
Crown;
and
being
now
almost
facing
the
house
where
the
Bateses
lodged,
Emma
recollected
his
intended
visit
the
day
before,
and
asked
him
if
he
had
paid
it.
"Yes,
oh!
yes"
he
replied;
"I
was
just
going
to
mention
it.
A
very
successful
visit:
I
saw
all
the
three
ladies;
and
felt
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
preparatory
hint.
If
the
talking
aunt
had
taken
me
quite
by
surprize,
it
must
have
been
the
death
of
me.
As
it
was,
I
was
only
betrayed
into
paying
a
most
unreasonable
visit.
Ten
minutes
would
have
been
all
that
was
necessary,
perhaps
all
that
was
proper;
and
I
had
told
my
father
I
should
certainly
be
at
home
before
him
but
there
was
no
getting
away,
no
pause;
and,
to
my
utter
astonishment,
I
found,
when
he
(finding
me
nowhere
else)
joined
me
there
at
last,
that
I
had
been
actually
sitting
with
them
very
nearly
three
quarters
of
an
hour.
The
good
lady
had
not
given
me
the
possibility
of
escape
before."
"And
how
did
you
think
Miss
Fairfax
looking?"
"Ill,
very
ill
that
is,
if
a
young
lady
can
ever
be
allowed
to
look
ill.
But
the
expression
is
hardly
admissible,
Mrs.
Weston,
is
it?
Ladies
can
never
look
ill.
And,
seriously,
Miss
Fairfax
is
naturally
so
pale,
as
almost
always
to
give
the
appearance
of
ill
health.
A
most
deplorable
want
of
complexion."
Emma
would
not
agree
to
this,
and
began
a
warm
defence
of
Miss
Fairfax's
complexion.
"It
was
certainly
never
brilliant,
but
she
would
not
allow
it
to
have
a
sickly
hue
in
general;
and
there
was
a
softness
and
delicacy
in
her
skin
which
gave
peculiar
elegance
to
the
character
of
her
face."
He
listened
with
all
due
deference;
acknowledged
that
he
had
heard
many
people
say
the
same
but
yet
he
must
confess,
that
to
him
nothing
could
make
amends
for
the
want
of
the
fine
glow
of
health.
Where
features
were
indifferent,
a
fine
complexion
gave
beauty
to
them
all;
and
where
they
were
good,
the
effect
was
fortunately
he
need
not
attempt
to
describe
what
the
effect
was.
"Well,"
said
Emma,
"there
is
no
disputing
about
taste.
At
least
you
admire
her
except
her
complexion."
He
shook
his
head
and
