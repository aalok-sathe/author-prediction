to
speak
to
you,"
took
her
out
of
the
room.
Jane
instantly
gave
a
look
at
Elizabeth
which
spoke
her
distress
at
such
premeditation,
and
her
entreaty
that
she
would
not
give
in
to
it.
In
a
few
minutes,
Mrs.
Bennet
half
opened
the
door
and
called
out:
"Lizzy,
my
dear,
I
want
to
speak
with
you."
Elizabeth
was
forced
to
go.
"We
may
as
well
leave
them
by
themselves
you
know;"
said
her
mother,
as
soon
as
she
was
in
the
hall.
"Kitty
and
I
are
going
up
stairs
to
sit
in
my
dressing
room."
Elizabeth
made
no
attempt
to
reason
with
her
mother,
but
remained
quietly
in
the
hall,
till
she
and
Kitty
were
out
of
sight,
then
returned
into
the
drawing
room.
Mrs.
Bennet's
schemes
for
this
day
were
ineffectual.
Bingley
was
every
thing
that
was
charming,
except
the
professed
lover
of
her
daughter.
His
ease
and
cheerfulness
rendered
him
a
most
agreeable
addition
to
their
evening
party;
and
he
bore
with
the
ill
judged
officiousness
of
the
mother,
and
heard
all
her
silly
remarks
with
a
forbearance
and
command
of
countenance
particularly
grateful
to
the
daughter.
He
scarcely
needed
an
invitation
to
stay
supper;
and
before
he
went
away,
an
engagement
was
formed,
chiefly
through
his
own
and
Mrs.
Bennet's
means,
for
his
coming
next
morning
to
shoot
with
her
husband.
After
this
day,
Jane
said
no
more
of
her
indifference.
Not
a
word
passed
between
the
sisters
concerning
Bingley;
but
Elizabeth
went
to
bed
in
the
happy
belief
that
all
must
speedily
be
concluded,
unless
Mr.
Darcy
returned
within
the
stated
time.
Seriously,
however,
she
felt
tolerably
persuaded
that
all
this
must
have
taken
place
with
that
gentleman's
concurrence.
Bingley
was
punctual
to
his
appointment;
and
he
and
Mr.
Bennet
spent
the
morning
together,
as
had
been
agreed
on.
The
latter
was
much
more
agreeable
than
his
companion
expected.
There
was
nothing
of
presumption
or
folly
in
Bingley
that
could
provoke
his
ridicule,
or
disgust
him
into
silence;
and
he
was
more
communicative,
and
less
eccentric,
than
the
other
had
ever
seen
him.
Bingley
of
course
returned
with
him
to
dinner;
and
in
the
evening
Mrs.
Bennet's
invention
was
again
at
work
to
get
every
body
away
from
him
and
her
daughter.
Elizabeth,
who
had
a
letter
to
write,
went
into
the
breakfast
room
for
that
purpose
soon
after
tea;
for
as
the
others
were
all
going
to
sit
down
to
cards,
she
could
not
be
wanted
to
counteract
her
mother's
schemes.
But
on
returning
to
the
drawing
room,
when
her
letter
was
finished,
she
saw,
to
her
infinite
surprise,
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
her
mother
had
been
too
ingenious
for
her.
On
opening
the
door,
she
perceived
her
sister
and
Bingley
standing
together
over
the
hearth,
as
if
engaged
in
earnest
conversation;
and
had
this
led
to
no
suspicion,
the
faces
of
both,
as
they
hastily
turned
round
and
moved
away
from
each
other,
would
have
told
it
all.
Their
situation
was
awkward
enough;
but
hers
she
thought
was
still
worse.
Not
a
syllable
was
uttered
by
either;
and
Elizabeth
was
on
the
point
of
going
away
again,
when
Bingley,
who
as
well
as
the
other
had
sat
down,
suddenly
rose,
and
whispering
a
few
words
to
her
sister,
ran
out
of
the
room.
Jane
could
have
no
reserves
from
Elizabeth,
where
confidence
would
give
pleasure;
and
instantly
embracing
her,
acknowledged,
with
the
liveliest
emotion,
that
she
was
the
happiest
creature
in
the
world.
"'Tis
too
much!"
she
added,
"by
far
too
much.
I
do
not
deserve
it.
Oh!
why
is
not
everybody
as
happy?"
Elizabeth's
congratulations
were
given
with
a
sincerity,
a
warmth,
a
delight,
which
words
could
but
poorly
express.
Every
sentence
of
kindness
was
a
fresh
source
of
happiness
to
Jane.
But
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
stay
with
her
sister,
or
say
half
that
remained
to
be
said
for
the
present.
"I
must
go
instantly
to
my
mother;"
she
cried.
"I
would
not
on
any
account
trifle
with
her
affectionate
solicitude;
or
allow
her
to
hear
it
from
anyone
but
myself.
He
is
gone
to
my
father
already.
Oh!
Lizzy,
to
know
that
what
I
have
to
relate
will
give
such
pleasure
to
all
my
dear
family!
how
shall
I
bear
so
much
happiness!"
She
then
hastened
away
to
her
mother,
who
had
purposely
broken
up
the
card
party,
and
was
sitting
up
stairs
with
Kitty.
Elizabeth,
who
was
left
by
herself,
now
smiled
at
the
rapidity
and
ease
with
which
an
affair
was
finally
settled,
that
had
given
them
so
many
previous
months
of
suspense
and
vexation.
"And
this,"
said
she,
"is
the
end
of
all
his
friend's
anxious
circumspection!
of
all
his
sister's
falsehood
and
contrivance!
the
happiest,
wisest,
most
reasonable
end!"
In
a
few
minutes
she
was
joined
by
Bingley,
whose
conference
with
her
father
had
been
short
and
to
the
purpose.
"Where
is
your
sister?"
said
he
hastily,
as
he
opened
the
door.
"With
my
mother
up
stairs.
She
will
be
down
in
a
moment,
I
dare
say."
He
then
shut
the
door,
and,
coming
up
to
her,
claimed
the
good
wishes
and
affection
of
a
sister.
Elizabeth
honestly
and
heartily
expressed
her
delight
in
the
prospect
of
their
relationship.
They
shook
hands
with
great
cordiality;
and
then,
till
her
sister
came
down,
she
had
to
listen
to
all
he
had
to
say
of
his
own
happiness,
and
of
Jane's
perfections;
and
in
spite
of
his
being
a
lover,
Elizabeth
really
believed
all
his
expectations
of
felicity
to
be
rationally
founded,
because
they
had
for
basis
the
excellent
understanding,
and
super
excellent
disposition
of
Jane,
and
a
general
similarity
of
feeling
and
taste
between
her
and
himself.
It
was
an
evening
of
no
common
delight
to
them
all;
the
satisfaction
of
Miss
Bennet's
mind
gave
a
glow
of
such
sweet
animation
to
her
face,
as
made
her
look
handsomer
than
ever.
Kitty
simpered
and
smiled,
and
hoped
her
turn
was
coming
soon.
Mrs.
