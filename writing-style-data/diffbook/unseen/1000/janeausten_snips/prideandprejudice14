Mrs.
Bennet
began
repeating
her
thanks
to
Mr.
Bingley
for
his
kindness
to
Jane,
with
an
apology
for
troubling
him
also
with
Lizzy.
Mr.
Bingley
was
unaffectedly
civil
in
his
answer,
and
forced
his
younger
sister
to
be
civil
also,
and
say
what
the
occasion
required.
She
performed
her
part
indeed
without
much
graciousness,
but
Mrs.
Bennet
was
satisfied,
and
soon
afterwards
ordered
her
carriage.
Upon
this
signal,
the
youngest
of
her
daughters
put
herself
forward.
The
two
girls
had
been
whispering
to
each
other
during
the
whole
visit,
and
the
result
of
it
was,
that
the
youngest
should
tax
Mr.
Bingley
with
having
promised
on
his
first
coming
into
the
country
to
give
a
ball
at
Netherfield.
Lydia
was
a
stout,
well
grown
girl
of
fifteen,
with
a
fine
complexion
and
good
humoured
countenance;
a
favourite
with
her
mother,
whose
affection
had
brought
her
into
public
at
an
early
age.
She
had
high
animal
spirits,
and
a
sort
of
natural
self
consequence,
which
the
attention
of
the
officers,
to
whom
her
uncle's
good
dinners,
and
her
own
easy
manners
recommended
her,
had
increased
into
assurance.
She
was
very
equal,
therefore,
to
address
Mr.
Bingley
on
the
subject
of
the
ball,
and
abruptly
reminded
him
of
his
promise;
adding,
that
it
would
be
the
most
shameful
thing
in
the
world
if
he
did
not
keep
it.
His
answer
to
this
sudden
attack
was
delightful
to
their
mother's
ear:
"I
am
perfectly
ready,
I
assure
you,
to
keep
my
engagement;
and
when
your
sister
is
recovered,
you
shall,
if
you
please,
name
the
very
day
of
the
ball.
But
you
would
not
wish
to
be
dancing
when
she
is
ill."
Lydia
declared
herself
satisfied.
"Oh!
yes
it
would
be
much
better
to
wait
till
Jane
was
well,
and
by
that
time
most
likely
Captain
Carter
would
be
at
Meryton
again.
And
when
you
have
given
your
ball,"
she
added,
"I
shall
insist
on
their
giving
one
also.
I
shall
tell
Colonel
Forster
it
will
be
quite
a
shame
if
he
does
not."
Mrs.
Bennet
and
her
daughters
then
departed,
and
Elizabeth
returned
instantly
to
Jane,
leaving
her
own
and
her
relations'
behaviour
to
the
remarks
of
the
two
ladies
and
Mr.
Darcy;
the
latter
of
whom,
however,
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
join
in
their
censure
of
her,
in
spite
of
all
Miss
Bingley's
witticisms
on
fine
eyes.
The
day
passed
much
as
the
day
before
had
done.
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
had
spent
some
hours
of
the
morning
with
the
invalid,
who
continued,
though
slowly,
to
mend;
and
in
the
evening
Elizabeth
joined
their
party
in
the
drawing
room.
The
loo
table,
however,
did
not
appear.
Mr.
Darcy
was
writing,
and
Miss
Bingley,
seated
near
him,
was
watching
the
progress
of
his
letter
and
repeatedly
calling
off
his
attention
by
messages
to
his
sister.
Mr.
Hurst
and
Mr.
Bingley
were
at
piquet,
and
Mrs.
Hurst
was
observing
their
game.
Elizabeth
took
up
some
needlework,
and
was
sufficiently
amused
in
attending
to
what
passed
between
Darcy
and
his
companion.
The
perpetual
commendations
of
the
lady,
either
on
his
handwriting,
or
on
the
evenness
of
his
lines,
or
on
the
length
of
his
letter,
with
the
perfect
unconcern
with
which
her
praises
were
received,
formed
a
curious
dialogue,
and
was
exactly
in
union
with
her
opinion
of
each.
"How
delighted
Miss
Darcy
will
be
to
receive
such
a
letter!"
He
made
no
answer.
"You
write
uncommonly
fast."
"You
are
mistaken.
I
write
rather
slowly."
"How
many
letters
you
must
have
occasion
to
write
in
the
course
of
a
year!
Letters
of
business,
too!
How
odious
I
should
think
them!"
"It
is
fortunate,
then,
that
they
fall
to
my
lot
instead
of
yours."
"Pray
tell
your
sister
that
I
long
to
see
her."
"I
have
already
told
her
so
once,
by
your
desire."
"I
am
afraid
you
do
not
like
your
pen.
Let
me
mend
it
for
you.
I
mend
pens
remarkably
well."
"Thank
you
but
I
always
mend
my
own."
"How
can
you
contrive
to
write
so
even?"
He
was
silent.
"Tell
your
sister
I
am
delighted
to
hear
of
her
improvement
on
the
harp;
and
pray
let
her
know
that
I
am
quite
in
raptures
with
her
beautiful
little
design
for
a
table,
and
I
think
it
infinitely
superior
to
Miss
Grantley's."
"Will
you
give
me
leave
to
defer
your
raptures
till
I
write
again?
At
present
I
have
not
room
to
do
them
justice."
"Oh!
it
is
of
no
consequence.
I
shall
see
her
in
January.
But
do
you
always
write
such
charming
long
letters
to
her,
Mr.
Darcy?"
"They
are
generally
long;
but
whether
always
charming
it
is
not
for
me
to
determine."
"It
is
a
rule
with
me,
that
a
person
who
can
write
a
long
letter
with
ease,
cannot
write
ill."
"That
will
not
do
for
a
compliment
to
Darcy,
Caroline,"
cried
her
brother,
"because
he
does
not
write
with
ease.
He
studies
too
much
for
words
of
four
syllables.
Do
not
you,
Darcy?"
"My
style
of
writing
is
very
different
from
yours."
"Oh!"
cried
Miss
Bingley,
"Charles
writes
in
the
most
careless
way
imaginable.
He
leaves
out
half
his
words,
and
blots
the
rest."
"My
ideas
flow
so
rapidly
that
I
have
not
time
to
express
them
by
which
means
my
letters
sometimes
convey
no
ideas
at
all
to
my
correspondents."
"Your
humility,
Mr.
Bingley,"
said
Elizabeth,
"must
disarm
reproof."
"Nothing
is
more
deceitful,"
said
Darcy,
"than
the
appearance
of
humility.
It
is
often
only
carelessness
of
opinion,
and
sometimes
an
indirect
boast."
"And
which
of
the
two
do
you
call
my
little
recent
piece
of
modesty?"
"The
indirect
boast;
for
you
are
really
proud
of
your
defects
in
writing,
because
you
consider
them
as
proceeding
from
a
rapidity
of
thought
and
carelessness
of
execution,
which,
if
not
estimable,
you
think
at
least
highly
interesting.
The
power
of
doing
anything
with
quickness
is
always
prized
much
by
the
possessor,
and
often
without
any
attention
