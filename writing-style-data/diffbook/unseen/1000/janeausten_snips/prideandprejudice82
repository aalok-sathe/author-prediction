dancing
together
at
Netherfield."
Elizabeth
was
pleased
to
find
his
memory
so
exact;
and
he
afterwards
took
occasion
to
ask
her,
when
unattended
to
by
any
of
the
rest,
whether
all
her
sisters
were
at
Longbourn.
There
was
not
much
in
the
question,
nor
in
the
preceding
remark;
but
there
was
a
look
and
a
manner
which
gave
them
meaning.
It
was
not
often
that
she
could
turn
her
eyes
on
Mr.
Darcy
himself;
but,
whenever
she
did
catch
a
glimpse,
she
saw
an
expression
of
general
complaisance,
and
in
all
that
he
said
she
heard
an
accent
so
removed
from
hauteur
or
disdain
of
his
companions,
as
convinced
her
that
the
improvement
of
manners
which
she
had
yesterday
witnessed
however
temporary
its
existence
might
prove,
had
at
least
outlived
one
day.
When
she
saw
him
thus
seeking
the
acquaintance
and
courting
the
good
opinion
of
people
with
whom
any
intercourse
a
few
months
ago
would
have
been
a
disgrace
when
she
saw
him
thus
civil,
not
only
to
herself,
but
to
the
very
relations
whom
he
had
openly
disdained,
and
recollected
their
last
lively
scene
in
Hunsford
Parsonage
the
difference,
the
change
was
so
great,
and
struck
so
forcibly
on
her
mind,
that
she
could
hardly
restrain
her
astonishment
from
being
visible.
Never,
even
in
the
company
of
his
dear
friends
at
Netherfield,
or
his
dignified
relations
at
Rosings,
had
she
seen
him
so
desirous
to
please,
so
free
from
self
consequence
or
unbending
reserve,
as
now,
when
no
importance
could
result
from
the
success
of
his
endeavours,
and
when
even
the
acquaintance
of
those
to
whom
his
attentions
were
addressed
would
draw
down
the
ridicule
and
censure
of
the
ladies
both
of
Netherfield
and
Rosings.
Their
visitors
stayed
with
them
above
half
an
hour;
and
when
they
arose
to
depart,
Mr.
Darcy
called
on
his
sister
to
join
him
in
expressing
their
wish
of
seeing
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner,
and
Miss
Bennet,
to
dinner
at
Pemberley,
before
they
left
the
country.
Miss
Darcy,
though
with
a
diffidence
which
marked
her
little
in
the
habit
of
giving
invitations,
readily
obeyed.
Mrs.
Gardiner
looked
at
her
niece,
desirous
of
knowing
how
she,
whom
the
invitation
most
concerned,
felt
disposed
as
to
its
acceptance,
but
Elizabeth
had
turned
away
her
head.
Presuming
however,
that
this
studied
avoidance
spoke
rather
a
momentary
embarrassment
than
any
dislike
of
the
proposal,
and
seeing
in
her
husband,
who
was
fond
of
society,
a
perfect
willingness
to
accept
it,
she
ventured
to
engage
for
her
attendance,
and
the
day
after
the
next
was
fixed
on.
Bingley
expressed
great
pleasure
in
the
certainty
of
seeing
Elizabeth
again,
having
still
a
great
deal
to
say
to
her,
and
many
inquiries
to
make
after
all
their
Hertfordshire
friends.
Elizabeth,
construing
all
this
into
a
wish
of
hearing
her
speak
of
her
sister,
was
pleased,
and
on
this
account,
as
well
as
some
others,
found
herself,
when
their
visitors
left
them,
capable
of
considering
the
last
half
hour
with
some
satisfaction,
though
while
it
was
passing,
the
enjoyment
of
it
had
been
little.
Eager
to
be
alone,
and
fearful
of
inquiries
or
hints
from
her
uncle
and
aunt,
she
stayed
with
them
only
long
enough
to
hear
their
favourable
opinion
of
Bingley,
and
then
hurried
away
to
dress.
But
she
had
no
reason
to
fear
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner's
curiosity;
it
was
not
their
wish
to
force
her
communication.
It
was
evident
that
she
was
much
better
acquainted
with
Mr.
Darcy
than
they
had
before
any
idea
of;
it
was
evident
that
he
was
very
much
in
love
with
her.
They
saw
much
to
interest,
but
nothing
to
justify
inquiry.
Of
Mr.
Darcy
it
was
now
a
matter
of
anxiety
to
think
well;
and,
as
far
as
their
acquaintance
reached,
there
was
no
fault
to
find.
They
could
not
be
untouched
by
his
politeness;
and
had
they
drawn
his
character
from
their
own
feelings
and
his
servant's
report,
without
any
reference
to
any
other
account,
the
circle
in
Hertfordshire
to
which
he
was
known
would
not
have
recognized
it
for
Mr.
Darcy.
There
was
now
an
interest,
however,
in
believing
the
housekeeper;
and
they
soon
became
sensible
that
the
authority
of
a
servant
who
had
known
him
since
he
was
four
years
old,
and
whose
own
manners
indicated
respectability,
was
not
to
be
hastily
rejected.
Neither
had
anything
occurred
in
the
intelligence
of
their
Lambton
friends
that
could
materially
lessen
its
weight.
They
had
nothing
to
accuse
him
of
but
pride;
pride
he
probably
had,
and
if
not,
it
would
certainly
be
imputed
by
the
inhabitants
of
a
small
market
town
where
the
family
did
not
visit.
It
was
acknowledged,
however,
that
he
was
a
liberal
man,
and
did
much
good
among
the
poor.
With
respect
to
Wickham,
the
travellers
soon
found
that
he
was
not
held
there
in
much
estimation;
for
though
the
chief
of
his
concerns
with
the
son
of
his
patron
were
imperfectly
understood,
it
was
yet
a
well
known
fact
that,
on
his
quitting
Derbyshire,
he
had
left
many
debts
behind
him,
which
Mr.
Darcy
afterwards
discharged.
As
for
Elizabeth,
her
thoughts
were
at
Pemberley
this
evening
more
than
the
last;
and
the
evening,
though
as
it
passed
it
seemed
long,
was
not
long
enough
to
determine
her
feelings
towards
one
in
that
mansion;
and
she
lay
awake
two
whole
hours
endeavouring
to
make
them
out.
She
certainly
did
not
hate
him.
No;
hatred
had
vanished
long
ago,
and
she
had
almost
as
long
been
ashamed
of
ever
feeling
a
dislike
against
him,
that
could
be
so
called.
The
respect
created
by
the
conviction
of
his
valuable
qualities,
though
at
first
unwillingly
admitted,
had
for
some
time
ceased
to
be
repugnant
to
her
feeling;
and
it
was
now
heightened
into
somewhat
of
a
friendlier
nature,
by
the
testimony
so
highly
in
his
favour,
and
bringing
forward
his
disposition
in
so
amiable
a
light,
which
yesterday
had
produced.
But
above
all,
above
respect
and
esteem,
there
was
