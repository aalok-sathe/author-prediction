together,
it
will
not
give
me
another
moment's
pang:
and
to
convince
you
that
I
have
been
speaking
truth,
I
am
now
going
to
destroy
what
I
ought
to
have
destroyed
long
ago
what
I
ought
never
to
have
kept
I
know
that
very
well
(blushing
as
she
spoke).
However,
now
I
will
destroy
it
all
and
it
is
my
particular
wish
to
do
it
in
your
presence,
that
you
may
see
how
rational
I
am
grown.
Cannot
you
guess
what
this
parcel
holds?"
said
she,
with
a
conscious
look.
"Not
the
least
in
the
world.
Did
he
ever
give
you
any
thing?"
"No
I
cannot
call
them
gifts;
but
they
are
things
that
I
have
valued
very
much."
She
held
the
parcel
towards
her,
and
Emma
read
the
words
Most
precious
treasures
on
the
top.
Her
curiosity
was
greatly
excited.
Harriet
unfolded
the
parcel,
and
she
looked
on
with
impatience.
Within
abundance
of
silver
paper
was
a
pretty
little
Tunbridge
ware
box,
which
Harriet
opened:
it
was
well
lined
with
the
softest
cotton;
but,
excepting
the
cotton,
Emma
saw
only
a
small
piece
of
court
plaister.
"Now,"
said
Harriet,
"you
must
recollect."
"No,
indeed
I
do
not."
"Dear
me!
I
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
you
could
forget
what
passed
in
this
very
room
about
court
plaister,
one
of
the
very
last
times
we
ever
met
in
it!
It
was
but
a
very
few
days
before
I
had
my
sore
throat
just
before
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Knightley
came
I
think
the
very
evening.
Do
not
you
remember
his
cutting
his
finger
with
your
new
penknife,
and
your
recommending
court
plaister?
But,
as
you
had
none
about
you,
and
knew
I
had,
you
desired
me
to
supply
him;
and
so
I
took
mine
out
and
cut
him
a
piece;
but
it
was
a
great
deal
too
large,
and
he
cut
it
smaller,
and
kept
playing
some
time
with
what
was
left,
before
he
gave
it
back
to
me.
And
so
then,
in
my
nonsense,
I
could
not
help
making
a
treasure
of
it
so
I
put
it
by
never
to
be
used,
and
looked
at
it
now
and
then
as
a
great
treat."
"My
dearest
Harriet!"
cried
Emma,
putting
her
hand
before
her
face,
and
jumping
up,
"you
make
me
more
ashamed
of
myself
than
I
can
bear.
Remember
it?
Aye,
I
remember
it
all
now;
all,
except
your
saving
this
relic
I
knew
nothing
of
that
till
this
moment
but
the
cutting
the
finger,
and
my
recommending
court
plaister,
and
saying
I
had
none
about
me!
Oh!
my
sins,
my
sins!
And
I
had
plenty
all
the
while
in
my
pocket!
One
of
my
senseless
tricks!
I
deserve
to
be
under
a
continual
blush
all
the
rest
of
my
life.
Well
(sitting
down
again)
go
on
what
else?"
"And
had
you
really
some
at
hand
yourself?
I
am
sure
I
never
suspected
it,
you
did
it
so
naturally."
"And
so
you
actually
put
this
piece
of
court
plaister
by
for
his
sake!"
said
Emma,
recovering
from
her
state
of
shame
and
feeling
divided
between
wonder
and
amusement.
And
secretly
she
added
to
herself,
"Lord
bless
me!
when
should
I
ever
have
thought
of
putting
by
in
cotton
a
piece
of
court
plaister
that
Frank
Churchill
had
been
pulling
about!
I
never
was
equal
to
this."
"Here,"
resumed
Harriet,
turning
to
her
box
again,
"here
is
something
still
more
valuable,
I
mean
that
has
been
more
valuable,
because
this
is
what
did
really
once
belong
to
him,
which
the
court
plaister
never
did."
Emma
was
quite
eager
to
see
this
superior
treasure.
It
was
the
end
of
an
old
pencil,
the
part
without
any
lead.
"This
was
really
his,"
said
Harriet.
"Do
not
you
remember
one
morning?
no,
I
dare
say
you
do
not.
But
one
morning
I
forget
exactly
the
day
but
perhaps
it
was
the
Tuesday
or
Wednesday
before
that
evening,
he
wanted
to
make
a
memorandum
in
his
pocket
book;
it
was
about
spruce
beer.
Mr.
Knightley
had
been
telling
him
something
about
brewing
spruce
beer,
and
he
wanted
to
put
it
down;
but
when
he
took
out
his
pencil,
there
was
so
little
lead
that
he
soon
cut
it
all
away,
and
it
would
not
do,
so
you
lent
him
another,
and
this
was
left
upon
the
table
as
good
for
nothing.
But
I
kept
my
eye
on
it;
and,
as
soon
as
I
dared,
caught
it
up,
and
never
parted
with
it
again
from
that
moment."
"I
do
remember
it,"
cried
Emma;
"I
perfectly
remember
it.
Talking
about
spruce
beer.
Oh!
yes
Mr.
Knightley
and
I
both
saying
we
liked
it,
and
Mr.
Elton's
seeming
resolved
to
learn
to
like
it
too.
I
perfectly
remember
it.
Stop;
Mr.
Knightley
was
standing
just
here,
was
not
he?
I
have
an
idea
he
was
standing
just
here."
"Ah!
I
do
not
know.
I
cannot
recollect.
It
is
very
odd,
but
I
cannot
recollect.
Mr.
Elton
was
sitting
here,
I
remember,
much
about
where
I
am
now."
"Well,
go
on."
"Oh!
that's
all.
I
have
nothing
more
to
shew
you,
or
to
say
except
that
I
am
now
going
to
throw
them
both
behind
the
fire,
and
I
wish
you
to
see
me
do
it."
"My
poor
dear
Harriet!
and
have
you
actually
found
happiness
in
treasuring
up
these
things?"
"Yes,
simpleton
as
I
was!
but
I
am
quite
ashamed
of
it
now,
and
wish
I
could
forget
as
easily
as
I
can
burn
them.
It
was
very
wrong
of
me,
you
know,
to
keep
any
remembrances,
after
he
was
married.
I
knew
it
was
but
had
not
resolution
enough
to
part
with
them."
"But,
Harriet,
is
it
necessary
to
burn
the
court
plaister?
I
have
not
a
word
to
say
for
the
bit
of
old
pencil,
but
the
court
plaister
might
be
useful."
"I
shall
be
happier
to
burn
it,"
replied
Harriet.
"It
has
a
disagreeable
look
to
me.
I
must
get
rid
of
every
