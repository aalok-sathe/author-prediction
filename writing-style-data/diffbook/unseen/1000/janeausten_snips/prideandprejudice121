more
likely
to
want
more
time
than
courage,
Elizabeth.
But
it
ought
to
be
done,
and
if
you
will
give
me
a
sheet
of
paper,
it
shall
be
done
directly."
"And
if
I
had
not
a
letter
to
write
myself,
I
might
sit
by
you
and
admire
the
evenness
of
your
writing,
as
another
young
lady
once
did.
But
I
have
an
aunt,
too,
who
must
not
be
longer
neglected."
From
an
unwillingness
to
confess
how
much
her
intimacy
with
Mr.
Darcy
had
been
over
rated,
Elizabeth
had
never
yet
answered
Mrs.
Gardiner's
long
letter;
but
now,
having
that
to
communicate
which
she
knew
would
be
most
welcome,
she
was
almost
ashamed
to
find
that
her
uncle
and
aunt
had
already
lost
three
days
of
happiness,
and
immediately
wrote
as
follows:
"I
would
have
thanked
you
before,
my
dear
aunt,
as
I
ought
to
have
done,
for
your
long,
kind,
satisfactory,
detail
of
particulars;
but
to
say
the
truth,
I
was
too
cross
to
write.
You
supposed
more
than
really
existed.
But
now
suppose
as
much
as
you
choose;
give
a
loose
rein
to
your
fancy,
indulge
your
imagination
in
every
possible
flight
which
the
subject
will
afford,
and
unless
you
believe
me
actually
married,
you
cannot
greatly
err.
You
must
write
again
very
soon,
and
praise
him
a
great
deal
more
than
you
did
in
your
last.
I
thank
you,
again
and
again,
for
not
going
to
the
Lakes.
How
could
I
be
so
silly
as
to
wish
it!
Your
idea
of
the
ponies
is
delightful.
We
will
go
round
the
Park
every
day.
I
am
the
happiest
creature
in
the
world.
Perhaps
other
people
have
said
so
before,
but
not
one
with
such
justice.
I
am
happier
even
than
Jane;
she
only
smiles,
I
laugh.
Mr.
Darcy
sends
you
all
the
love
in
the
world
that
he
can
spare
from
me.
You
are
all
to
come
to
Pemberley
at
Christmas.
Yours,
etc."
Mr.
Darcy's
letter
to
Lady
Catherine
was
in
a
different
style;
and
still
different
from
either
was
what
Mr.
Bennet
sent
to
Mr.
Collins,
in
reply
to
his
last.
"DEAR
SIR,
"I
must
trouble
you
once
more
for
congratulations.
Elizabeth
will
soon
be
the
wife
of
Mr.
Darcy.
Console
Lady
Catherine
as
well
as
you
can.
But,
if
I
were
you,
I
would
stand
by
the
nephew.
He
has
more
to
give.
"Yours
sincerely,
etc."
Miss
Bingley's
congratulations
to
her
brother,
on
his
approaching
marriage,
were
all
that
was
affectionate
and
insincere.
She
wrote
even
to
Jane
on
the
occasion,
to
express
her
delight,
and
repeat
all
her
former
professions
of
regard.
Jane
was
not
deceived,
but
she
was
affected;
and
though
feeling
no
reliance
on
her,
could
not
help
writing
her
a
much
kinder
answer
than
she
knew
was
deserved.
The
joy
which
Miss
Darcy
expressed
on
receiving
similar
information,
was
as
sincere
as
her
brother's
in
sending
it.
Four
sides
of
paper
were
insufficient
to
contain
all
her
delight,
and
all
her
earnest
desire
of
being
loved
by
her
sister.
Before
any
answer
could
arrive
from
Mr.
Collins,
or
any
congratulations
to
Elizabeth
from
his
wife,
the
Longbourn
family
heard
that
the
Collinses
were
come
themselves
to
Lucas
Lodge.
The
reason
of
this
sudden
removal
was
soon
evident.
Lady
Catherine
had
been
rendered
so
exceedingly
angry
by
the
contents
of
her
nephew's
letter,
that
Charlotte,
really
rejoicing
in
the
match,
was
anxious
to
get
away
till
the
storm
was
blown
over.
At
such
a
moment,
the
arrival
of
her
friend
was
a
sincere
pleasure
to
Elizabeth,
though
in
the
course
of
their
meetings
she
must
sometimes
think
the
pleasure
dearly
bought,
when
she
saw
Mr.
Darcy
exposed
to
all
the
parading
and
obsequious
civility
of
her
husband.
He
bore
it,
however,
with
admirable
calmness.
He
could
even
listen
to
Sir
William
Lucas,
when
he
complimented
him
on
carrying
away
the
brightest
jewel
of
the
country,
and
expressed
his
hopes
of
their
all
meeting
frequently
at
St.
James's,
with
very
decent
composure.
If
he
did
shrug
his
shoulders,
it
was
not
till
Sir
William
was
out
of
sight.
Mrs.
Phillips's
vulgarity
was
another,
and
perhaps
a
greater,
tax
on
his
forbearance;
and
though
Mrs.
Phillips,
as
well
as
her
sister,
stood
in
too
much
awe
of
him
to
speak
with
the
familiarity
which
Bingley's
good
humour
encouraged,
yet,
whenever
she
did
speak,
she
must
be
vulgar.
Nor
was
her
respect
for
him,
though
it
made
her
more
quiet,
at
all
likely
to
make
her
more
elegant.
Elizabeth
did
all
she
could
to
shield
him
from
the
frequent
notice
of
either,
and
was
ever
anxious
to
keep
him
to
herself,
and
to
those
of
her
family
with
whom
he
might
converse
without
mortification;
and
though
the
uncomfortable
feelings
arising
from
all
this
took
from
the
season
of
courtship
much
of
its
pleasure,
it
added
to
the
hope
of
the
future;
and
she
looked
forward
with
delight
to
the
time
when
they
should
be
removed
from
society
so
little
pleasing
to
either,
to
all
the
comfort
and
elegance
of
their
family
party
at
Pemberley.
Happy
for
all
her
maternal
feelings
was
the
day
on
which
Mrs.
Bennet
got
rid
of
her
two
most
deserving
daughters.
With
what
delighted
pride
she
afterwards
visited
Mrs.
Bingley,
and
talked
of
Mrs.
Darcy,
may
be
guessed.
I
wish
I
could
say,
for
the
sake
of
her
family,
that
the
accomplishment
of
her
earnest
desire
in
the
establishment
of
so
many
of
her
children
produced
so
happy
an
effect
as
to
make
her
a
sensible,
amiable,
well
informed
woman
for
the
rest
of
her
life;
though
perhaps
it
was
lucky
for
her
husband,
who
might
not
have
relished
domestic
felicity
in
so
unusual
a
form,
that
she
still
was
occasionally
nervous
and
invariably
silly.
Mr.
Bennet
missed
his
second
daughter
exceedingly;
his
affection
for
her
drew
him
oftener
from
home
than
anything
else
could
do.
He
delighted
in
going
to
Pemberley,
especially
when
he
was
least
expected.
Mr.
Bingley
and
Jane
remained
