be
in
friendship
with
such
a
man?
How
can
they
suit
each
other?
Do
you
know
Mr.
Bingley?"
"Not
at
all."
"He
is
a
sweet
tempered,
amiable,
charming
man.
He
cannot
know
what
Mr.
Darcy
is."
"Probably
not;
but
Mr.
Darcy
can
please
where
he
chooses.
He
does
not
want
abilities.
He
can
be
a
conversible
companion
if
he
thinks
it
worth
his
while.
Among
those
who
are
at
all
his
equals
in
consequence,
he
is
a
very
different
man
from
what
he
is
to
the
less
prosperous.
His
pride
never
deserts
him;
but
with
the
rich
he
is
liberal
minded,
just,
sincere,
rational,
honourable,
and
perhaps
agreeable
allowing
something
for
fortune
and
figure."
The
whist
party
soon
afterwards
breaking
up,
the
players
gathered
round
the
other
table
and
Mr.
Collins
took
his
station
between
his
cousin
Elizabeth
and
Mrs.
Phillips.
The
usual
inquiries
as
to
his
success
were
made
by
the
latter.
It
had
not
been
very
great;
he
had
lost
every
point;
but
when
Mrs.
Phillips
began
to
express
her
concern
thereupon,
he
assured
her
with
much
earnest
gravity
that
it
was
not
of
the
least
importance,
that
he
considered
the
money
as
a
mere
trifle,
and
begged
that
she
would
not
make
herself
uneasy.
"I
know
very
well,
madam,"
said
he,
"that
when
persons
sit
down
to
a
card
table,
they
must
take
their
chances
of
these
things,
and
happily
I
am
not
in
such
circumstances
as
to
make
five
shillings
any
object.
There
are
undoubtedly
many
who
could
not
say
the
same,
but
thanks
to
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh,
I
am
removed
far
beyond
the
necessity
of
regarding
little
matters."
Mr.
Wickham's
attention
was
caught;
and
after
observing
Mr.
Collins
for
a
few
moments,
he
asked
Elizabeth
in
a
low
voice
whether
her
relation
was
very
intimately
acquainted
with
the
family
of
de
Bourgh.
"Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh,"
she
replied,
"has
very
lately
given
him
a
living.
I
hardly
know
how
Mr.
Collins
was
first
introduced
to
her
notice,
but
he
certainly
has
not
known
her
long."
"You
know
of
course
that
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
and
Lady
Anne
Darcy
were
sisters;
consequently
that
she
is
aunt
to
the
present
Mr.
Darcy."
"No,
indeed,
I
did
not.
I
knew
nothing
at
all
of
Lady
Catherine's
connections.
I
never
heard
of
her
existence
till
the
day
before
yesterday."
"Her
daughter,
Miss
de
Bourgh,
will
have
a
very
large
fortune,
and
it
is
believed
that
she
and
her
cousin
will
unite
the
two
estates."
This
information
made
Elizabeth
smile,
as
she
thought
of
poor
Miss
Bingley.
Vain
indeed
must
be
all
her
attentions,
vain
and
useless
her
affection
for
his
sister
and
her
praise
of
himself,
if
he
were
already
self
destined
for
another.
"Mr.
Collins,"
said
she,
"speaks
highly
both
of
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter;
but
from
some
particulars
that
he
has
related
of
her
ladyship,
I
suspect
his
gratitude
misleads
him,
and
that
in
spite
of
her
being
his
patroness,
she
is
an
arrogant,
conceited
woman."
"I
believe
her
to
be
both
in
a
great
degree,"
replied
Wickham;
"I
have
not
seen
her
for
many
years,
but
I
very
well
remember
that
I
never
liked
her,
and
that
her
manners
were
dictatorial
and
insolent.
She
has
the
reputation
of
being
remarkably
sensible
and
clever;
but
I
rather
believe
she
derives
part
of
her
abilities
from
her
rank
and
fortune,
part
from
her
authoritative
manner,
and
the
rest
from
the
pride
for
her
nephew,
who
chooses
that
everyone
connected
with
him
should
have
an
understanding
of
the
first
class."
Elizabeth
allowed
that
he
had
given
a
very
rational
account
of
it,
and
they
continued
talking
together,
with
mutual
satisfaction
till
supper
put
an
end
to
cards,
and
gave
the
rest
of
the
ladies
their
share
of
Mr.
Wickham's
attentions.
There
could
be
no
conversation
in
the
noise
of
Mrs.
Phillips's
supper
party,
but
his
manners
recommended
him
to
everybody.
Whatever
he
said,
was
said
well;
and
whatever
he
did,
done
gracefully.
Elizabeth
went
away
with
her
head
full
of
him.
She
could
think
of
nothing
but
of
Mr.
Wickham,
and
of
what
he
had
told
her,
all
the
way
home;
but
there
was
not
time
for
her
even
to
mention
his
name
as
they
went,
for
neither
Lydia
nor
Mr.
Collins
were
once
silent.
Lydia
talked
incessantly
of
lottery
tickets,
of
the
fish
she
had
lost
and
the
fish
she
had
won;
and
Mr.
Collins
in
describing
the
civility
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Phillips,
protesting
that
he
did
not
in
the
least
regard
his
losses
at
whist,
enumerating
all
the
dishes
at
supper,
and
repeatedly
fearing
that
he
crowded
his
cousins,
had
more
to
say
than
he
could
well
manage
before
the
carriage
stopped
at
Longbourn
House.
Elizabeth
related
to
Jane
the
next
day
what
had
passed
between
Mr.
Wickham
and
herself.
Jane
listened
with
astonishment
and
concern;
she
knew
not
how
to
believe
that
Mr.
Darcy
could
be
so
unworthy
of
Mr.
Bingley's
regard;
and
yet,
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
question
the
veracity
of
a
young
man
of
such
amiable
appearance
as
Wickham.
The
possibility
of
his
having
endured
such
unkindness,
was
enough
to
interest
all
her
tender
feelings;
and
nothing
remained
therefore
to
be
done,
but
to
think
well
of
them
both,
to
defend
the
conduct
of
each,
and
throw
into
the
account
of
accident
or
mistake
whatever
could
not
be
otherwise
explained.
"They
have
both,"
said
she,
"been
deceived,
I
dare
say,
in
some
way
or
other,
of
which
we
can
form
no
idea.
Interested
people
have
perhaps
misrepresented
each
to
the
other.
It
is,
in
short,
impossible
for
us
to
conjecture
the
causes
or
circumstances
which
may
have
alienated
them,
without
actual
blame
on
either
side."
"Very
true,
indeed;
and
now,
my
dear
Jane,
what
have
you
got
to
say
on
behalf
of
the
interested
people
who
have
probably
been
concerned
in
the
business?
Do
clear
them
too,
or
we
shall
be
obliged
to
think
ill
of
somebody."
