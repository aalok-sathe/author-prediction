in
silence;
and,
at
last,
on
the
young
lady's
whispering
to
Elizabeth
again,
he
walked
away.
When
the
tea
things
were
removed,
and
the
card
tables
placed,
the
ladies
all
rose,
and
Elizabeth
was
then
hoping
to
be
soon
joined
by
him,
when
all
her
views
were
overthrown
by
seeing
him
fall
a
victim
to
her
mother's
rapacity
for
whist
players,
and
in
a
few
moments
after
seated
with
the
rest
of
the
party.
She
now
lost
every
expectation
of
pleasure.
They
were
confined
for
the
evening
at
different
tables,
and
she
had
nothing
to
hope,
but
that
his
eyes
were
so
often
turned
towards
her
side
of
the
room,
as
to
make
him
play
as
unsuccessfully
as
herself.
Mrs.
Bennet
had
designed
to
keep
the
two
Netherfield
gentlemen
to
supper;
but
their
carriage
was
unluckily
ordered
before
any
of
the
others,
and
she
had
no
opportunity
of
detaining
them.
"Well
girls,"
said
she,
as
soon
as
they
were
left
to
themselves,
"What
say
you
to
the
day?
I
think
every
thing
has
passed
off
uncommonly
well,
I
assure
you.
The
dinner
was
as
well
dressed
as
any
I
ever
saw.
The
venison
was
roasted
to
a
turn
and
everybody
said
they
never
saw
so
fat
a
haunch.
The
soup
was
fifty
times
better
than
what
we
had
at
the
Lucases'
last
week;
and
even
Mr.
Darcy
acknowledged,
that
the
partridges
were
remarkably
well
done;
and
I
suppose
he
has
two
or
three
French
cooks
at
least.
And,
my
dear
Jane,
I
never
saw
you
look
in
greater
beauty.
Mrs.
Long
said
so
too,
for
I
asked
her
whether
you
did
not.
And
what
do
you
think
she
said
besides?
'Ah!
Mrs.
Bennet,
we
shall
have
her
at
Netherfield
at
last.'
She
did
indeed.
I
do
think
Mrs.
Long
is
as
good
a
creature
as
ever
lived
and
her
nieces
are
very
pretty
behaved
girls,
and
not
at
all
handsome:
I
like
them
prodigiously."
Mrs.
Bennet,
in
short,
was
in
very
great
spirits;
she
had
seen
enough
of
Bingley's
behaviour
to
Jane,
to
be
convinced
that
she
would
get
him
at
last;
and
her
expectations
of
advantage
to
her
family,
when
in
a
happy
humour,
were
so
far
beyond
reason,
that
she
was
quite
disappointed
at
not
seeing
him
there
again
the
next
day,
to
make
his
proposals.
"It
has
been
a
very
agreeable
day,"
said
Miss
Bennet
to
Elizabeth.
"The
party
seemed
so
well
selected,
so
suitable
one
with
the
other.
I
hope
we
may
often
meet
again."
Elizabeth
smiled.
"Lizzy,
you
must
not
do
so.
You
must
not
suspect
me.
It
mortifies
me.
I
assure
you
that
I
have
now
learnt
to
enjoy
his
conversation
as
an
agreeable
and
sensible
young
man,
without
having
a
wish
beyond
it.
I
am
perfectly
satisfied,
from
what
his
manners
now
are,
that
he
never
had
any
design
of
engaging
my
affection.
It
is
only
that
he
is
blessed
with
greater
sweetness
of
address,
and
a
stronger
desire
of
generally
pleasing,
than
any
other
man."
"You
are
very
cruel,"
said
her
sister,
"you
will
not
let
me
smile,
and
are
provoking
me
to
it
every
moment."
"How
hard
it
is
in
some
cases
to
be
believed!"
"And
how
impossible
in
others!"
"But
why
should
you
wish
to
persuade
me
that
I
feel
more
than
I
acknowledge?"
"That
is
a
question
which
I
hardly
know
how
to
answer.
We
all
love
to
instruct,
though
we
can
teach
only
what
is
not
worth
knowing.
Forgive
me;
and
if
you
persist
in
indifference,
do
not
make
me
your
confidante."
A
few
days
after
this
visit,
Mr.
Bingley
called
again,
and
alone.
His
friend
had
left
him
that
morning
for
London,
but
was
to
return
home
in
ten
days
time.
He
sat
with
them
above
an
hour,
and
was
in
remarkably
good
spirits.
Mrs.
Bennet
invited
him
to
dine
with
them;
but,
with
many
expressions
of
concern,
he
confessed
himself
engaged
elsewhere.
"Next
time
you
call,"
said
she,
"I
hope
we
shall
be
more
lucky."
He
should
be
particularly
happy
at
any
time,
etc.
etc.;
and
if
she
would
give
him
leave,
would
take
an
early
opportunity
of
waiting
on
them.
"Can
you
come
to
morrow?"
Yes,
he
had
no
engagement
at
all
for
to
morrow;
and
her
invitation
was
accepted
with
alacrity.
He
came,
and
in
such
very
good
time
that
the
ladies
were
none
of
them
dressed.
In
ran
Mrs.
Bennet
to
her
daughter's
room,
in
her
dressing
gown,
and
with
her
hair
half
finished,
crying
out:
"My
dear
Jane,
make
haste
and
hurry
down.
He
is
come
Mr.
Bingley
is
come.
He
is,
indeed.
Make
haste,
make
haste.
Here,
Sarah,
come
to
Miss
Bennet
this
moment,
and
help
her
on
with
her
gown.
Never
mind
Miss
Lizzy's
hair."
"We
will
be
down
as
soon
as
we
can,"
said
Jane;
"but
I
dare
say
Kitty
is
forwarder
than
either
of
us,
for
she
went
up
stairs
half
an
hour
ago."
"Oh!
hang
Kitty!
what
has
she
to
do
with
it?
Come
be
quick,
be
quick!
Where
is
your
sash,
my
dear?"
But
when
her
mother
was
gone,
Jane
would
not
be
prevailed
on
to
go
down
without
one
of
her
sisters.
The
same
anxiety
to
get
them
by
themselves
was
visible
again
in
the
evening.
After
tea,
Mr.
Bennet
retired
to
the
library,
as
was
his
custom,
and
Mary
went
up
stairs
to
her
instrument.
Two
obstacles
of
the
five
being
thus
removed,
Mrs.
Bennet
sat
looking
and
winking
at
Elizabeth
and
Catherine
for
a
considerable
time,
without
making
any
impression
on
them.
Elizabeth
would
not
observe
her;
and
when
at
last
Kitty
did,
she
very
innocently
said,
"What
is
the
matter
mamma?
What
do
you
keep
winking
at
me
for?
What
am
I
to
do?"
"Nothing
child,
nothing.
I
did
not
wink
at
you."
She
then
sat
still
five
minutes
longer;
but
unable
to
waste
such
a
precious
occasion,
she
suddenly
got
up,
and
saying
to
Kitty,
"Come
here,
my
love,
I
want
