not,
I
hope,
of
understanding.
My
temper
I
dare
not
vouch
for.
It
is,
I
believe,
too
little
yielding
certainly
too
little
for
the
convenience
of
the
world.
I
cannot
forget
the
follies
and
vices
of
others
so
soon
as
I
ought,
nor
their
offenses
against
myself.
My
feelings
are
not
puffed
about
with
every
attempt
to
move
them.
My
temper
would
perhaps
be
called
resentful.
My
good
opinion
once
lost,
is
lost
forever."
"That
is
a
failing
indeed!"
cried
Elizabeth.
"Implacable
resentment
is
a
shade
in
a
character.
But
you
have
chosen
your
fault
well.
I
really
cannot
laugh
at
it.
You
are
safe
from
me."
"There
is,
I
believe,
in
every
disposition
a
tendency
to
some
particular
evil
a
natural
defect,
which
not
even
the
best
education
can
overcome."
"And
your
defect
is
to
hate
everybody."
"And
yours,"
he
replied
with
a
smile,
"is
willfully
to
misunderstand
them."
"Do
let
us
have
a
little
music,"
cried
Miss
Bingley,
tired
of
a
conversation
in
which
she
had
no
share.
"Louisa,
you
will
not
mind
my
waking
Mr.
Hurst?"
Her
sister
had
not
the
smallest
objection,
and
the
pianoforte
was
opened;
and
Darcy,
after
a
few
moments'
recollection,
was
not
sorry
for
it.
He
began
to
feel
the
danger
of
paying
Elizabeth
too
much
attention.
In
consequence
of
an
agreement
between
the
sisters,
Elizabeth
wrote
the
next
morning
to
their
mother,
to
beg
that
the
carriage
might
be
sent
for
them
in
the
course
of
the
day.
But
Mrs.
Bennet,
who
had
calculated
on
her
daughters
remaining
at
Netherfield
till
the
following
Tuesday,
which
would
exactly
finish
Jane's
week,
could
not
bring
herself
to
receive
them
with
pleasure
before.
Her
answer,
therefore,
was
not
propitious,
at
least
not
to
Elizabeth's
wishes,
for
she
was
impatient
to
get
home.
Mrs.
Bennet
sent
them
word
that
they
could
not
possibly
have
the
carriage
before
Tuesday;
and
in
her
postscript
it
was
added,
that
if
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
sister
pressed
them
to
stay
longer,
she
could
spare
them
very
well.
Against
staying
longer,
however,
Elizabeth
was
positively
resolved
nor
did
she
much
expect
it
would
be
asked;
and
fearful,
on
the
contrary,
as
being
considered
as
intruding
themselves
needlessly
long,
she
urged
Jane
to
borrow
Mr.
Bingley's
carriage
immediately,
and
at
length
it
was
settled
that
their
original
design
of
leaving
Netherfield
that
morning
should
be
mentioned,
and
the
request
made.
The
communication
excited
many
professions
of
concern;
and
enough
was
said
of
wishing
them
to
stay
at
least
till
the
following
day
to
work
on
Jane;
and
till
the
morrow
their
going
was
deferred.
Miss
Bingley
was
then
sorry
that
she
had
proposed
the
delay,
for
her
jealousy
and
dislike
of
one
sister
much
exceeded
her
affection
for
the
other.
The
master
of
the
house
heard
with
real
sorrow
that
they
were
to
go
so
soon,
and
repeatedly
tried
to
persuade
Miss
Bennet
that
it
would
not
be
safe
for
her
that
she
was
not
enough
recovered;
but
Jane
was
firm
where
she
felt
herself
to
be
right.
To
Mr.
Darcy
it
was
welcome
intelligence
Elizabeth
had
been
at
Netherfield
long
enough.
She
attracted
him
more
than
he
liked
and
Miss
Bingley
was
uncivil
to
her,
and
more
teasing
than
usual
to
himself.
He
wisely
resolved
to
be
particularly
careful
that
no
sign
of
admiration
should
now
escape
him,
nothing
that
could
elevate
her
with
the
hope
of
influencing
his
felicity;
sensible
that
if
such
an
idea
had
been
suggested,
his
behaviour
during
the
last
day
must
have
material
weight
in
confirming
or
crushing
it.
Steady
to
his
purpose,
he
scarcely
spoke
ten
words
to
her
through
the
whole
of
Saturday,
and
though
they
were
at
one
time
left
by
themselves
for
half
an
hour,
he
adhered
most
conscientiously
to
his
book,
and
would
not
even
look
at
her.
On
Sunday,
after
morning
service,
the
separation,
so
agreeable
to
almost
all,
took
place.
Miss
Bingley's
civility
to
Elizabeth
increased
at
last
very
rapidly,
as
well
as
her
affection
for
Jane;
and
when
they
parted,
after
assuring
the
latter
of
the
pleasure
it
would
always
give
her
to
see
her
either
at
Longbourn
or
Netherfield,
and
embracing
her
most
tenderly,
she
even
shook
hands
with
the
former.
Elizabeth
took
leave
of
the
whole
party
in
the
liveliest
of
spirits.
They
were
not
welcomed
home
very
cordially
by
their
mother.
Mrs.
Bennet
wondered
at
their
coming,
and
thought
them
very
wrong
to
give
so
much
trouble,
and
was
sure
Jane
would
have
caught
cold
again.
But
their
father,
though
very
laconic
in
his
expressions
of
pleasure,
was
really
glad
to
see
them;
he
had
felt
their
importance
in
the
family
circle.
The
evening
conversation,
when
they
were
all
assembled,
had
lost
much
of
its
animation,
and
almost
all
its
sense
by
the
absence
of
Jane
and
Elizabeth.
They
found
Mary,
as
usual,
deep
in
the
study
of
thorough
bass
and
human
nature;
and
had
some
extracts
to
admire,
and
some
new
observations
of
threadbare
morality
to
listen
to.
Catherine
and
Lydia
had
information
for
them
of
a
different
sort.
Much
had
been
done
and
much
had
been
said
in
the
regiment
since
the
preceding
Wednesday;
several
of
the
officers
had
dined
lately
with
their
uncle,
a
private
had
been
flogged,
and
it
had
actually
been
hinted
that
Colonel
Forster
was
going
to
be
married.
"I
hope,
my
dear,"
said
Mr.
Bennet
to
his
wife,
as
they
were
at
breakfast
the
next
morning,
"that
you
have
ordered
a
good
dinner
to
day,
because
I
have
reason
to
expect
an
addition
to
our
family
party."
"Who
do
you
mean,
my
dear?
I
know
of
nobody
that
is
coming,
I
am
sure,
unless
Charlotte
Lucas
should
happen
to
call
in
and
I
hope
my
dinners
are
good
enough
for
her.
I
do
not
believe
she
often
sees
such
at
home."
"The
person
of
whom
I
speak
is
a
gentleman,
and
a
stranger."
Mrs.
Bennet's
eyes
sparkled.
"A
gentleman
and
a
stranger!
It
is
Mr.
Bingley,
I
