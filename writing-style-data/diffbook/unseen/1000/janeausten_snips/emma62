I
have
been
so
disappointed."
And
she
leaned
back
in
the
corner,
to
indulge
her
murmurs,
or
to
reason
them
away;
probably
a
little
of
both
such
being
the
commonest
process
of
a
not
ill
disposed
mind.
Presently
the
carriage
stopt;
she
looked
up;
it
was
stopt
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston,
who
were
standing
to
speak
to
her.
There
was
instant
pleasure
in
the
sight
of
them,
and
still
greater
pleasure
was
conveyed
in
sound
for
Mr.
Weston
immediately
accosted
her
with,
"How
d'ye
do?
how
d'ye
do?
We
have
been
sitting
with
your
father
glad
to
see
him
so
well.
Frank
comes
to
morrow
I
had
a
letter
this
morning
we
see
him
to
morrow
by
dinner
time
to
a
certainty
he
is
at
Oxford
to
day,
and
he
comes
for
a
whole
fortnight;
I
knew
it
would
be
so.
If
he
had
come
at
Christmas
he
could
not
have
staid
three
days;
I
was
always
glad
he
did
not
come
at
Christmas;
now
we
are
going
to
have
just
the
right
weather
for
him,
fine,
dry,
settled
weather.
We
shall
enjoy
him
completely;
every
thing
has
turned
out
exactly
as
we
could
wish."
There
was
no
resisting
such
news,
no
possibility
of
avoiding
the
influence
of
such
a
happy
face
as
Mr.
Weston's,
confirmed
as
it
all
was
by
the
words
and
the
countenance
of
his
wife,
fewer
and
quieter,
but
not
less
to
the
purpose.
To
know
that
she
thought
his
coming
certain
was
enough
to
make
Emma
consider
it
so,
and
sincerely
did
she
rejoice
in
their
joy.
It
was
a
most
delightful
reanimation
of
exhausted
spirits.
The
worn
out
past
was
sunk
in
the
freshness
of
what
was
coming;
and
in
the
rapidity
of
half
a
moment's
thought,
she
hoped
Mr.
Elton
would
now
be
talked
of
no
more.
Mr.
Weston
gave
her
the
history
of
the
engagements
at
Enscombe,
which
allowed
his
son
to
answer
for
having
an
entire
fortnight
at
his
command,
as
well
as
the
route
and
the
method
of
his
journey;
and
she
listened,
and
smiled,
and
congratulated.
"I
shall
soon
bring
him
over
to
Hartfield,"
said
he,
at
the
conclusion.
Emma
could
imagine
she
saw
a
touch
of
the
arm
at
this
speech,
from
his
wife.
"We
had
better
move
on,
Mr.
Weston,"
said
she,
"we
are
detaining
the
girls."
"Well,
well,
I
am
ready;"
and
turning
again
to
Emma,
"but
you
must
not
be
expecting
such
a
very
fine
young
man;
you
have
only
had
my
account
you
know;
I
dare
say
he
is
really
nothing
extraordinary:"
though
his
own
sparkling
eyes
at
the
moment
were
speaking
a
very
different
conviction.
Emma
could
look
perfectly
unconscious
and
innocent,
and
answer
in
a
manner
that
appropriated
nothing.
"Think
of
me
to
morrow,
my
dear
Emma,
about
four
o'clock,"
was
Mrs.
Weston's
parting
injunction;
spoken
with
some
anxiety,
and
meant
only
for
her.
"Four
o'clock!
depend
upon
it
he
will
be
here
by
three,"
was
Mr.
Weston's
quick
amendment;
and
so
ended
a
most
satisfactory
meeting.
Emma's
spirits
were
mounted
quite
up
to
happiness;
every
thing
wore
a
different
air;
James
and
his
horses
seemed
not
half
so
sluggish
as
before.
When
she
looked
at
the
hedges,
she
thought
the
elder
at
least
must
soon
be
coming
out;
and
when
she
turned
round
to
Harriet,
she
saw
something
like
a
look
of
spring,
a
tender
smile
even
there.
"Will
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
pass
through
Bath
as
well
as
Oxford?"
was
a
question,
however,
which
did
not
augur
much.
But
neither
geography
nor
tranquillity
could
come
all
at
once,
and
Emma
was
now
in
a
humour
to
resolve
that
they
should
both
come
in
time.
The
morning
of
the
interesting
day
arrived,
and
Mrs.
Weston's
faithful
pupil
did
not
forget
either
at
ten,
or
eleven,
or
twelve
o'clock,
that
she
was
to
think
of
her
at
four.
"My
dear,
dear
anxious
friend,"
said
she,
in
mental
soliloquy,
while
walking
downstairs
from
her
own
room,
"always
overcareful
for
every
body's
comfort
but
your
own;
I
see
you
now
in
all
your
little
fidgets,
going
again
and
again
into
his
room,
to
be
sure
that
all
is
right."
The
clock
struck
twelve
as
she
passed
through
the
hall.
"'Tis
twelve;
I
shall
not
forget
to
think
of
you
four
hours
hence;
and
by
this
time
to
morrow,
perhaps,
or
a
little
later,
I
may
be
thinking
of
the
possibility
of
their
all
calling
here.
I
am
sure
they
will
bring
him
soon."
She
opened
the
parlour
door,
and
saw
two
gentlemen
sitting
with
her
father
Mr.
Weston
and
his
son.
They
had
been
arrived
only
a
few
minutes,
and
Mr.
Weston
had
scarcely
finished
his
explanation
of
Frank's
being
a
day
before
his
time,
and
her
father
was
yet
in
the
midst
of
his
very
civil
welcome
and
congratulations,
when
she
appeared,
to
have
her
share
of
surprize,
introduction,
and
pleasure.
The
Frank
Churchill
so
long
talked
of,
so
high
in
interest,
was
actually
before
her
he
was
presented
to
her,
and
she
did
not
think
too
much
had
been
said
in
his
praise;
he
was
a
very
good
looking
young
man;
height,
air,
address,
all
were
unexceptionable,
and
his
countenance
had
a
great
deal
of
the
spirit
and
liveliness
of
his
father's;
he
looked
quick
and
sensible.
She
felt
immediately
that
she
should
like
him;
and
there
was
a
well
bred
ease
of
manner,
and
a
readiness
to
talk,
which
convinced
her
that
he
came
intending
to
be
acquainted
with
her,
and
that
acquainted
they
soon
must
be.
He
had
reached
Randalls
the
evening
before.
She
was
pleased
with
the
eagerness
to
arrive
which
had
made
him
alter
his
plan,
and
travel
earlier,
later,
and
quicker,
that
he
might
gain
half
a
day.
"I
told
you
yesterday,"
cried
Mr.
Weston
with
exultation,
"I
told
you
all
that
he
would
be
here
before
the
time
named.
I
remembered
what
I
used
to
do
myself.
One
cannot
creep
upon
a
journey;
one
cannot
help
