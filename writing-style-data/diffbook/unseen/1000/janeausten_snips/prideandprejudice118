you;
and
I
am
sure
nobody
else
will
believe
me,
if
you
do
not.
Yet,
indeed,
I
am
in
earnest.
I
speak
nothing
but
the
truth.
He
still
loves
me,
and
we
are
engaged."
Jane
looked
at
her
doubtingly.
"Oh,
Lizzy!
it
cannot
be.
I
know
how
much
you
dislike
him."
"You
know
nothing
of
the
matter.
That
is
all
to
be
forgot.
Perhaps
I
did
not
always
love
him
so
well
as
I
do
now.
But
in
such
cases
as
these,
a
good
memory
is
unpardonable.
This
is
the
last
time
I
shall
ever
remember
it
myself."
Miss
Bennet
still
looked
all
amazement.
Elizabeth
again,
and
more
seriously
assured
her
of
its
truth.
"Good
Heaven!
can
it
be
really
so!
Yet
now
I
must
believe
you,"
cried
Jane.
"My
dear,
dear
Lizzy,
I
would
I
do
congratulate
you
but
are
you
certain?
forgive
the
question
are
you
quite
certain
that
you
can
be
happy
with
him?"
"There
can
be
no
doubt
of
that.
It
is
settled
between
us
already,
that
we
are
to
be
the
happiest
couple
in
the
world.
But
are
you
pleased,
Jane?
Shall
you
like
to
have
such
a
brother?"
"Very,
very
much.
Nothing
could
give
either
Bingley
or
myself
more
delight.
But
we
considered
it,
we
talked
of
it
as
impossible.
And
do
you
really
love
him
quite
well
enough?
Oh,
Lizzy!
do
anything
rather
than
marry
without
affection.
Are
you
quite
sure
that
you
feel
what
you
ought
to
do?"
"Oh,
yes!
You
will
only
think
I
feel
more
than
I
ought
to
do,
when
I
tell
you
all."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"Why,
I
must
confess
that
I
love
him
better
than
I
do
Bingley.
I
am
afraid
you
will
be
angry."
"My
dearest
sister,
now
be
serious.
I
want
to
talk
very
seriously.
Let
me
know
every
thing
that
I
am
to
know,
without
delay.
Will
you
tell
me
how
long
you
have
loved
him?"
"It
has
been
coming
on
so
gradually,
that
I
hardly
know
when
it
began.
But
I
believe
I
must
date
it
from
my
first
seeing
his
beautiful
grounds
at
Pemberley."
Another
entreaty
that
she
would
be
serious,
however,
produced
the
desired
effect;
and
she
soon
satisfied
Jane
by
her
solemn
assurances
of
attachment.
When
convinced
on
that
article,
Miss
Bennet
had
nothing
further
to
wish.
"Now
I
am
quite
happy,"
said
she,
"for
you
will
be
as
happy
as
myself.
I
always
had
a
value
for
him.
Were
it
for
nothing
but
his
love
of
you,
I
must
always
have
esteemed
him;
but
now,
as
Bingley's
friend
and
your
husband,
there
can
be
only
Bingley
and
yourself
more
dear
to
me.
But
Lizzy,
you
have
been
very
sly,
very
reserved
with
me.
How
little
did
you
tell
me
of
what
passed
at
Pemberley
and
Lambton!
I
owe
all
that
I
know
of
it
to
another,
not
to
you."
Elizabeth
told
her
the
motives
of
her
secrecy.
She
had
been
unwilling
to
mention
Bingley;
and
the
unsettled
state
of
her
own
feelings
had
made
her
equally
avoid
the
name
of
his
friend.
But
now
she
would
no
longer
conceal
from
her
his
share
in
Lydia's
marriage.
All
was
acknowledged,
and
half
the
night
spent
in
conversation.
"Good
gracious!"
cried
Mrs.
Bennet,
as
she
stood
at
a
window
the
next
morning,
"if
that
disagreeable
Mr.
Darcy
is
not
coming
here
again
with
our
dear
Bingley!
What
can
he
mean
by
being
so
tiresome
as
to
be
always
coming
here?
I
had
no
notion
but
he
would
go
a
shooting,
or
something
or
other,
and
not
disturb
us
with
his
company.
What
shall
we
do
with
him?
Lizzy,
you
must
walk
out
with
him
again,
that
he
may
not
be
in
Bingley's
way."
Elizabeth
could
hardly
help
laughing
at
so
convenient
a
proposal;
yet
was
really
vexed
that
her
mother
should
be
always
giving
him
such
an
epithet.
As
soon
as
they
entered,
Bingley
looked
at
her
so
expressively,
and
shook
hands
with
such
warmth,
as
left
no
doubt
of
his
good
information;
and
he
soon
afterwards
said
aloud,
"Mrs.
Bennet,
have
you
no
more
lanes
hereabouts
in
which
Lizzy
may
lose
her
way
again
to
day?"
"I
advise
Mr.
Darcy,
and
Lizzy,
and
Kitty,"
said
Mrs.
Bennet,
"to
walk
to
Oakham
Mount
this
morning.
It
is
a
nice
long
walk,
and
Mr.
Darcy
has
never
seen
the
view."
"It
may
do
very
well
for
the
others,"
replied
Mr.
Bingley;
"but
I
am
sure
it
will
be
too
much
for
Kitty.
Won't
it,
Kitty?"
Kitty
owned
that
she
had
rather
stay
at
home.
Darcy
professed
a
great
curiosity
to
see
the
view
from
the
Mount,
and
Elizabeth
silently
consented.
As
she
went
up
stairs
to
get
ready,
Mrs.
Bennet
followed
her,
saying:
"I
am
quite
sorry,
Lizzy,
that
you
should
be
forced
to
have
that
disagreeable
man
all
to
yourself.
But
I
hope
you
will
not
mind
it:
it
is
all
for
Jane's
sake,
you
know;
and
there
is
no
occasion
for
talking
to
him,
except
just
now
and
then.
So,
do
not
put
yourself
to
inconvenience."
During
their
walk,
it
was
resolved
that
Mr.
Bennet's
consent
should
be
asked
in
the
course
of
the
evening.
Elizabeth
reserved
to
herself
the
application
for
her
mother's.
She
could
not
determine
how
her
mother
would
take
it;
sometimes
doubting
whether
all
his
wealth
and
grandeur
would
be
enough
to
overcome
her
abhorrence
of
the
man.
But
whether
she
were
violently
set
against
the
match,
or
violently
delighted
with
it,
it
was
certain
that
her
manner
would
be
equally
ill
adapted
to
do
credit
to
her
sense;
and
she
could
no
more
bear
that
Mr.
Darcy
should
hear
the
first
raptures
of
her
joy,
than
the
first
vehemence
of
her
disapprobation.
In
the
evening,
soon
after
Mr.
Bennet
withdrew
to
the
library,
she
saw
Mr.
Darcy
rise
also
and
follow
him,
and
her
agitation
on
seeing
it
was
extreme.
She
did
not
fear
her
father's
opposition,
but
he
was
going
to
be
made
