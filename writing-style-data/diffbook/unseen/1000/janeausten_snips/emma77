than
she
is
obliged
to
do,
because
she
will
have
to
teach.
The
Coxes
were
wondering
last
night
whether
she
would
get
into
any
great
family.
How
did
you
think
the
Coxes
looked?"
"Just
as
they
always
do
very
vulgar."
"They
told
me
something,"
said
Harriet
rather
hesitatingly;
"but
it
is
nothing
of
any
consequence."
Emma
was
obliged
to
ask
what
they
had
told
her,
though
fearful
of
its
producing
Mr.
Elton.
"They
told
me
that
Mr.
Martin
dined
with
them
last
Saturday."
"Oh!"
"He
came
to
their
father
upon
some
business,
and
he
asked
him
to
stay
to
dinner."
"Oh!"
"They
talked
a
great
deal
about
him,
especially
Anne
Cox.
I
do
not
know
what
she
meant,
but
she
asked
me
if
I
thought
I
should
go
and
stay
there
again
next
summer."
"She
meant
to
be
impertinently
curious,
just
as
such
an
Anne
Cox
should
be."
"She
said
he
was
very
agreeable
the
day
he
dined
there.
He
sat
by
her
at
dinner.
Miss
Nash
thinks
either
of
the
Coxes
would
be
very
glad
to
marry
him."
"Very
likely.
I
think
they
are,
without
exception,
the
most
vulgar
girls
in
Highbury."
Harriet
had
business
at
Ford's.
Emma
thought
it
most
prudent
to
go
with
her.
Another
accidental
meeting
with
the
Martins
was
possible,
and
in
her
present
state,
would
be
dangerous.
Harriet,
tempted
by
every
thing
and
swayed
by
half
a
word,
was
always
very
long
at
a
purchase;
and
while
she
was
still
hanging
over
muslins
and
changing
her
mind,
Emma
went
to
the
door
for
amusement.
Much
could
not
be
hoped
from
the
traffic
of
even
the
busiest
part
of
Highbury;
Mr.
Perry
walking
hastily
by,
Mr.
William
Cox
letting
himself
in
at
the
office
door,
Mr.
Cole's
carriage
horses
returning
from
exercise,
or
a
stray
letter
boy
on
an
obstinate
mule,
were
the
liveliest
objects
she
could
presume
to
expect;
and
when
her
eyes
fell
only
on
the
butcher
with
his
tray,
a
tidy
old
woman
travelling
homewards
from
shop
with
her
full
basket,
two
curs
quarrelling
over
a
dirty
bone,
and
a
string
of
dawdling
children
round
the
baker's
little
bow
window
eyeing
the
gingerbread,
she
knew
she
had
no
reason
to
complain,
and
was
amused
enough;
quite
enough
still
to
stand
at
the
door.
A
mind
lively
and
at
ease,
can
do
with
seeing
nothing,
and
can
see
nothing
that
does
not
answer.
She
looked
down
the
Randalls
road.
The
scene
enlarged;
two
persons
appeared;
Mrs.
Weston
and
her
son
in
law;
they
were
walking
into
Highbury;
to
Hartfield
of
course.
They
were
stopping,
however,
in
the
first
place
at
Mrs.
Bates's;
whose
house
was
a
little
nearer
Randalls
than
Ford's;
and
had
all
but
knocked,
when
Emma
caught
their
eye.
Immediately
they
crossed
the
road
and
came
forward
to
her;
and
the
agreeableness
of
yesterday's
engagement
seemed
to
give
fresh
pleasure
to
the
present
meeting.
Mrs.
Weston
informed
her
that
she
was
going
to
call
on
the
Bateses,
in
order
to
hear
the
new
instrument.
"For
my
companion
tells
me,"
said
she,
"that
I
absolutely
promised
Miss
Bates
last
night,
that
I
would
come
this
morning.
I
was
not
aware
of
it
myself.
I
did
not
know
that
I
had
fixed
a
day,
but
as
he
says
I
did,
I
am
going
now."
"And
while
Mrs.
Weston
pays
her
visit,
I
may
be
allowed,
I
hope,"
said
Frank
Churchill,
"to
join
your
party
and
wait
for
her
at
Hartfield
if
you
are
going
home."
Mrs.
Weston
was
disappointed.
"I
thought
you
meant
to
go
with
me.
They
would
be
very
much
pleased."
"Me!
I
should
be
quite
in
the
way.
But,
perhaps
I
may
be
equally
in
the
way
here.
Miss
Woodhouse
looks
as
if
she
did
not
want
me.
My
aunt
always
sends
me
off
when
she
is
shopping.
She
says
I
fidget
her
to
death;
and
Miss
Woodhouse
looks
as
if
she
could
almost
say
the
same.
What
am
I
to
do?"
"I
am
here
on
no
business
of
my
own,"
said
Emma;
"I
am
only
waiting
for
my
friend.
She
will
probably
have
soon
done,
and
then
we
shall
go
home.
But
you
had
better
go
with
Mrs.
Weston
and
hear
the
instrument."
"Well
if
you
advise
it.
But
(with
a
smile)
if
Colonel
Campbell
should
have
employed
a
careless
friend,
and
if
it
should
prove
to
have
an
indifferent
tone
what
shall
I
say?
I
shall
be
no
support
to
Mrs.
Weston.
She
might
do
very
well
by
herself.
A
disagreeable
truth
would
be
palatable
through
her
lips,
but
I
am
the
wretchedest
being
in
the
world
at
a
civil
falsehood."
"I
do
not
believe
any
such
thing,"
replied
Emma.
"I
am
persuaded
that
you
can
be
as
insincere
as
your
neighbours,
when
it
is
necessary;
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
the
instrument
is
indifferent.
Quite
otherwise
indeed,
if
I
understood
Miss
Fairfax's
opinion
last
night."
"Do
come
with
me,"
said
Mrs.
Weston,
"if
it
be
not
very
disagreeable
to
you.
It
need
not
detain
us
long.
We
will
go
to
Hartfield
afterwards.
We
will
follow
them
to
Hartfield.
I
really
wish
you
to
call
with
me.
It
will
be
felt
so
great
an
attention!
and
I
always
thought
you
meant
it."
He
could
say
no
more;
and
with
the
hope
of
Hartfield
to
reward
him,
returned
with
Mrs.
Weston
to
Mrs.
Bates's
door.
Emma
watched
them
in,
and
then
joined
Harriet
at
the
interesting
counter,
trying,
with
all
the
force
of
her
own
mind,
to
convince
her
that
if
she
wanted
plain
muslin
it
was
of
no
use
to
look
at
figured;
and
that
a
blue
ribbon,
be
it
ever
so
beautiful,
would
still
never
match
her
yellow
pattern.
At
last
it
was
all
settled,
even
to
the
destination
of
the
parcel.
"Should
I
send
it
to
Mrs.
Goddard's,
ma'am?"
asked
Mrs.
Ford.
"Yes
no
yes,
to
Mrs.
Goddard's.
Only
my
pattern
gown
is
at
Hartfield.
No,
you
shall
send
it
to
Hartfield,
if
you
