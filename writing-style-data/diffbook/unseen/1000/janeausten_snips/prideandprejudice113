this
extraordinary
application
have
been
as
frivolous
as
the
application
was
ill
judged.
You
have
widely
mistaken
my
character,
if
you
think
I
can
be
worked
on
by
such
persuasions
as
these.
How
far
your
nephew
might
approve
of
your
interference
in
his
affairs,
I
cannot
tell;
but
you
have
certainly
no
right
to
concern
yourself
in
mine.
I
must
beg,
therefore,
to
be
importuned
no
farther
on
the
subject."
"Not
so
hasty,
if
you
please.
I
have
by
no
means
done.
To
all
the
objections
I
have
already
urged,
I
have
still
another
to
add.
I
am
no
stranger
to
the
particulars
of
your
youngest
sister's
infamous
elopement.
I
know
it
all;
that
the
young
man's
marrying
her
was
a
patched
up
business,
at
the
expence
of
your
father
and
uncles.
And
is
such
a
girl
to
be
my
nephew's
sister?
Is
her
husband,
is
the
son
of
his
late
father's
steward,
to
be
his
brother?
Heaven
and
earth!
of
what
are
you
thinking?
Are
the
shades
of
Pemberley
to
be
thus
polluted?"
"You
can
now
have
nothing
further
to
say,"
she
resentfully
answered.
"You
have
insulted
me
in
every
possible
method.
I
must
beg
to
return
to
the
house."
And
she
rose
as
she
spoke.
Lady
Catherine
rose
also,
and
they
turned
back.
Her
ladyship
was
highly
incensed.
"You
have
no
regard,
then,
for
the
honour
and
credit
of
my
nephew!
Unfeeling,
selfish
girl!
Do
you
not
consider
that
a
connection
with
you
must
disgrace
him
in
the
eyes
of
everybody?"
"Lady
Catherine,
I
have
nothing
further
to
say.
You
know
my
sentiments."
"You
are
then
resolved
to
have
him?"
"I
have
said
no
such
thing.
I
am
only
resolved
to
act
in
that
manner,
which
will,
in
my
own
opinion,
constitute
my
happiness,
without
reference
to
you,
or
to
any
person
so
wholly
unconnected
with
me."
"It
is
well.
You
refuse,
then,
to
oblige
me.
You
refuse
to
obey
the
claims
of
duty,
honour,
and
gratitude.
You
are
determined
to
ruin
him
in
the
opinion
of
all
his
friends,
and
make
him
the
contempt
of
the
world."
"Neither
duty,
nor
honour,
nor
gratitude,"
replied
Elizabeth,
"have
any
possible
claim
on
me,
in
the
present
instance.
No
principle
of
either
would
be
violated
by
my
marriage
with
Mr.
Darcy.
And
with
regard
to
the
resentment
of
his
family,
or
the
indignation
of
the
world,
if
the
former
were
excited
by
his
marrying
me,
it
would
not
give
me
one
moment's
concern
and
the
world
in
general
would
have
too
much
sense
to
join
in
the
scorn."
"And
this
is
your
real
opinion!
This
is
your
final
resolve!
Very
well.
I
shall
now
know
how
to
act.
Do
not
imagine,
Miss
Bennet,
that
your
ambition
will
ever
be
gratified.
I
came
to
try
you.
I
hoped
to
find
you
reasonable;
but,
depend
upon
it,
I
will
carry
my
point."
In
this
manner
Lady
Catherine
talked
on,
till
they
were
at
the
door
of
the
carriage,
when,
turning
hastily
round,
she
added,
"I
take
no
leave
of
you,
Miss
Bennet.
I
send
no
compliments
to
your
mother.
You
deserve
no
such
attention.
I
am
most
seriously
displeased."
Elizabeth
made
no
answer;
and
without
attempting
to
persuade
her
ladyship
to
return
into
the
house,
walked
quietly
into
it
herself.
She
heard
the
carriage
drive
away
as
she
proceeded
up
stairs.
Her
mother
impatiently
met
her
at
the
door
of
the
dressing
room,
to
ask
why
Lady
Catherine
would
not
come
in
again
and
rest
herself.
"She
did
not
choose
it,"
said
her
daughter,
"she
would
go."
"She
is
a
very
fine
looking
woman!
and
her
calling
here
was
prodigiously
civil!
for
she
only
came,
I
suppose,
to
tell
us
the
Collinses
were
well.
She
is
on
her
road
somewhere,
I
dare
say,
and
so,
passing
through
Meryton,
thought
she
might
as
well
call
on
you.
I
suppose
she
had
nothing
particular
to
say
to
you,
Lizzy?"
Elizabeth
was
forced
to
give
into
a
little
falsehood
here;
for
to
acknowledge
the
substance
of
their
conversation
was
impossible.
The
discomposure
of
spirits
which
this
extraordinary
visit
threw
Elizabeth
into,
could
not
be
easily
overcome;
nor
could
she,
for
many
hours,
learn
to
think
of
it
less
than
incessantly.
Lady
Catherine,
it
appeared,
had
actually
taken
the
trouble
of
this
journey
from
Rosings,
for
the
sole
purpose
of
breaking
off
her
supposed
engagement
with
Mr.
Darcy.
It
was
a
rational
scheme,
to
be
sure!
but
from
what
the
report
of
their
engagement
could
originate,
Elizabeth
was
at
a
loss
to
imagine;
till
she
recollected
that
his
being
the
intimate
friend
of
Bingley,
and
her
being
the
sister
of
Jane,
was
enough,
at
a
time
when
the
expectation
of
one
wedding
made
everybody
eager
for
another,
to
supply
the
idea.
She
had
not
herself
forgotten
to
feel
that
the
marriage
of
her
sister
must
bring
them
more
frequently
together.
And
her
neighbours
at
Lucas
Lodge,
therefore
(for
through
their
communication
with
the
Collinses,
the
report,
she
concluded,
had
reached
Lady
Catherine),
had
only
set
that
down
as
almost
certain
and
immediate,
which
she
had
looked
forward
to
as
possible
at
some
future
time.
In
revolving
Lady
Catherine's
expressions,
however,
she
could
not
help
feeling
some
uneasiness
as
to
the
possible
consequence
of
her
persisting
in
this
interference.
From
what
she
had
said
of
her
resolution
to
prevent
their
marriage,
it
occurred
to
Elizabeth
that
she
must
meditate
an
application
to
her
nephew;
and
how
he
might
take
a
similar
representation
of
the
evils
attached
to
a
connection
with
her,
she
dared
not
pronounce.
She
knew
not
the
exact
degree
of
his
affection
for
his
aunt,
or
his
dependence
on
her
judgment,
but
it
was
natural
to
suppose
that
he
thought
much
higher
of
her
ladyship
than
she
could
do;
and
it
was
certain
that,
in
enumerating
the
miseries
of
a
marriage
with
one,
whose
immediate
connections
were
so
unequal
to
his
own,
his
aunt
would
address
him
on
his
weakest
side.
With
his
notions
of
