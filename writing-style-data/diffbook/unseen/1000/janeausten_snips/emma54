parents.
They
continued
together
with
unabated
regard
however,
till
the
marriage
of
Miss
Campbell,
who
by
that
chance,
that
luck
which
so
often
defies
anticipation
in
matrimonial
affairs,
giving
attraction
to
what
is
moderate
rather
than
to
what
is
superior,
engaged
the
affections
of
Mr.
Dixon,
a
young
man,
rich
and
agreeable,
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
acquainted;
and
was
eligibly
and
happily
settled,
while
Jane
Fairfax
had
yet
her
bread
to
earn.
This
event
had
very
lately
taken
place;
too
lately
for
any
thing
to
be
yet
attempted
by
her
less
fortunate
friend
towards
entering
on
her
path
of
duty;
though
she
had
now
reached
the
age
which
her
own
judgment
had
fixed
on
for
beginning.
She
had
long
resolved
that
one
and
twenty
should
be
the
period.
With
the
fortitude
of
a
devoted
novitiate,
she
had
resolved
at
one
and
twenty
to
complete
the
sacrifice,
and
retire
from
all
the
pleasures
of
life,
of
rational
intercourse,
equal
society,
peace
and
hope,
to
penance
and
mortification
for
ever.
The
good
sense
of
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
could
not
oppose
such
a
resolution,
though
their
feelings
did.
As
long
as
they
lived,
no
exertions
would
be
necessary,
their
home
might
be
hers
for
ever;
and
for
their
own
comfort
they
would
have
retained
her
wholly;
but
this
would
be
selfishness:
what
must
be
at
last,
had
better
be
soon.
Perhaps
they
began
to
feel
it
might
have
been
kinder
and
wiser
to
have
resisted
the
temptation
of
any
delay,
and
spared
her
from
a
taste
of
such
enjoyments
of
ease
and
leisure
as
must
now
be
relinquished.
Still,
however,
affection
was
glad
to
catch
at
any
reasonable
excuse
for
not
hurrying
on
the
wretched
moment.
She
had
never
been
quite
well
since
the
time
of
their
daughter's
marriage;
and
till
she
should
have
completely
recovered
her
usual
strength,
they
must
forbid
her
engaging
in
duties,
which,
so
far
from
being
compatible
with
a
weakened
frame
and
varying
spirits,
seemed,
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances,
to
require
something
more
than
human
perfection
of
body
and
mind
to
be
discharged
with
tolerable
comfort.
With
regard
to
her
not
accompanying
them
to
Ireland,
her
account
to
her
aunt
contained
nothing
but
truth,
though
there
might
be
some
truths
not
told.
It
was
her
own
choice
to
give
the
time
of
their
absence
to
Highbury;
to
spend,
perhaps,
her
last
months
of
perfect
liberty
with
those
kind
relations
to
whom
she
was
so
very
dear:
and
the
Campbells,
whatever
might
be
their
motive
or
motives,
whether
single,
or
double,
or
treble,
gave
the
arrangement
their
ready
sanction,
and
said,
that
they
depended
more
on
a
few
months
spent
in
her
native
air,
for
the
recovery
of
her
health,
than
on
any
thing
else.
Certain
it
was
that
she
was
to
come;
and
that
Highbury,
instead
of
welcoming
that
perfect
novelty
which
had
been
so
long
promised
it
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
must
put
up
for
the
present
with
Jane
Fairfax,
who
could
bring
only
the
freshness
of
a
two
years'
absence.
Emma
was
sorry;
to
have
to
pay
civilities
to
a
person
she
did
not
like
through
three
long
months!
to
be
always
doing
more
than
she
wished,
and
less
than
she
ought!
Why
she
did
not
like
Jane
Fairfax
might
be
a
difficult
question
to
answer;
Mr.
Knightley
had
once
told
her
it
was
because
she
saw
in
her
the
really
accomplished
young
woman,
which
she
wanted
to
be
thought
herself;
and
though
the
accusation
had
been
eagerly
refuted
at
the
time,
there
were
moments
of
self
examination
in
which
her
conscience
could
not
quite
acquit
her.
But
"she
could
never
get
acquainted
with
her:
she
did
not
know
how
it
was,
but
there
was
such
coldness
and
reserve
such
apparent
indifference
whether
she
pleased
or
not
and
then,
her
aunt
was
such
an
eternal
talker!
and
she
was
made
such
a
fuss
with
by
every
body!
and
it
had
been
always
imagined
that
they
were
to
be
so
intimate
because
their
ages
were
the
same,
every
body
had
supposed
they
must
be
so
fond
of
each
other."
These
were
her
reasons
she
had
no
better.
It
was
a
dislike
so
little
just
every
imputed
fault
was
so
magnified
by
fancy,
that
she
never
saw
Jane
Fairfax
the
first
time
after
any
considerable
absence,
without
feeling
that
she
had
injured
her;
and
now,
when
the
due
visit
was
paid,
on
her
arrival,
after
a
two
years'
interval,
she
was
particularly
struck
with
the
very
appearance
and
manners,
which
for
those
two
whole
years
she
had
been
depreciating.
Jane
Fairfax
was
very
elegant,
remarkably
elegant;
and
she
had
herself
the
highest
value
for
elegance.
Her
height
was
pretty,
just
such
as
almost
every
body
would
think
tall,
and
nobody
could
think
very
tall;
her
figure
particularly
graceful;
her
size
a
most
becoming
medium,
between
fat
and
thin,
though
a
slight
appearance
of
ill
health
seemed
to
point
out
the
likeliest
evil
of
the
two.
Emma
could
not
but
feel
all
this;
and
then,
her
face
her
features
there
was
more
beauty
in
them
altogether
than
she
had
remembered;
it
was
not
regular,
but
it
was
very
pleasing
beauty.
Her
eyes,
a
deep
grey,
with
dark
eye
lashes
and
eyebrows,
had
never
been
denied
their
praise;
but
the
skin,
which
she
had
been
used
to
cavil
at,
as
wanting
colour,
had
a
clearness
and
delicacy
which
really
needed
no
fuller
bloom.
It
was
a
style
of
beauty,
of
which
elegance
was
the
reigning
character,
and
as
such,
she
must,
in
honour,
by
all
her
principles,
admire
it:
elegance,
which,
whether
of
person
or
of
mind,
she
saw
so
little
in
Highbury.
There,
not
to
be
vulgar,
was
distinction,
and
merit.
In
short,
she
sat,
during
the
first
visit,
looking
at
Jane
Fairfax
with
twofold
complacency;
the
sense
of
pleasure
and
the
sense
of
rendering
justice,
and
was
determining
that
she
would
dislike
her
no
longer.
When
she
took
in
her
history,
indeed,
her
situation,
as
