few
minutes
silence,
he
said,
"Another
thing
must
be
taken
into
consideration
too
Mrs.
Elton
does
not
talk
to
Miss
Fairfax
as
she
speaks
of
her.
We
all
know
the
difference
between
the
pronouns
he
or
she
and
thou,
the
plainest
spoken
amongst
us;
we
all
feel
the
influence
of
a
something
beyond
common
civility
in
our
personal
intercourse
with
each
other
a
something
more
early
implanted.
We
cannot
give
any
body
the
disagreeable
hints
that
we
may
have
been
very
full
of
the
hour
before.
We
feel
things
differently.
And
besides
the
operation
of
this,
as
a
general
principle,
you
may
be
sure
that
Miss
Fairfax
awes
Mrs.
Elton
by
her
superiority
both
of
mind
and
manner;
and
that,
face
to
face,
Mrs.
Elton
treats
her
with
all
the
respect
which
she
has
a
claim
to.
Such
a
woman
as
Jane
Fairfax
probably
never
fell
in
Mrs.
Elton's
way
before
and
no
degree
of
vanity
can
prevent
her
acknowledging
her
own
comparative
littleness
in
action,
if
not
in
consciousness."
"I
know
how
highly
you
think
of
Jane
Fairfax,"
said
Emma.
Little
Henry
was
in
her
thoughts,
and
a
mixture
of
alarm
and
delicacy
made
her
irresolute
what
else
to
say.
"Yes,"
he
replied,
"any
body
may
know
how
highly
I
think
of
her."
"And
yet,"
said
Emma,
beginning
hastily
and
with
an
arch
look,
but
soon
stopping
it
was
better,
however,
to
know
the
worst
at
once
she
hurried
on
"And
yet,
perhaps,
you
may
hardly
be
aware
yourself
how
highly
it
is.
The
extent
of
your
admiration
may
take
you
by
surprize
some
day
or
other."
Mr.
Knightley
was
hard
at
work
upon
the
lower
buttons
of
his
thick
leather
gaiters,
and
either
the
exertion
of
getting
them
together,
or
some
other
cause,
brought
the
colour
into
his
face,
as
he
answered,
"Oh!
are
you
there?
But
you
are
miserably
behindhand.
Mr.
Cole
gave
me
a
hint
of
it
six
weeks
ago."
He
stopped.
Emma
felt
her
foot
pressed
by
Mrs.
Weston,
and
did
not
herself
know
what
to
think.
In
a
moment
he
went
on
"That
will
never
be,
however,
I
can
assure
you.
Miss
Fairfax,
I
dare
say,
would
not
have
me
if
I
were
to
ask
her
and
I
am
very
sure
I
shall
never
ask
her."
Emma
returned
her
friend's
pressure
with
interest;
and
was
pleased
enough
to
exclaim,
"You
are
not
vain,
Mr.
Knightley.
I
will
say
that
for
you."
He
seemed
hardly
to
hear
her;
he
was
thoughtful
and
in
a
manner
which
shewed
him
not
pleased,
soon
afterwards
said,
"So
you
have
been
settling
that
I
should
marry
Jane
Fairfax?"
"No
indeed
I
have
not.
You
have
scolded
me
too
much
for
match
making,
for
me
to
presume
to
take
such
a
liberty
with
you.
What
I
said
just
now,
meant
nothing.
One
says
those
sort
of
things,
of
course,
without
any
idea
of
a
serious
meaning.
Oh!
no,
upon
my
word
I
have
not
the
smallest
wish
for
your
marrying
Jane
Fairfax
or
Jane
any
body.
You
would
not
come
in
and
sit
with
us
in
this
comfortable
way,
if
you
were
married."
Mr.
Knightley
was
thoughtful
again.
The
result
of
his
reverie
was,
"No,
Emma,
I
do
not
think
the
extent
of
my
admiration
for
her
will
ever
take
me
by
surprize.
I
never
had
a
thought
of
her
in
that
way,
I
assure
you."
And
soon
afterwards,
"Jane
Fairfax
is
a
very
charming
young
woman
but
not
even
Jane
Fairfax
is
perfect.
She
has
a
fault.
She
has
not
the
open
temper
which
a
man
would
wish
for
in
a
wife."
Emma
could
not
but
rejoice
to
hear
that
she
had
a
fault.
"Well,"
said
she,
"and
you
soon
silenced
Mr.
Cole,
I
suppose?"
"Yes,
very
soon.
He
gave
me
a
quiet
hint;
I
told
him
he
was
mistaken;
he
asked
my
pardon
and
said
no
more.
Cole
does
not
want
to
be
wiser
or
wittier
than
his
neighbours."
"In
that
respect
how
unlike
dear
Mrs.
Elton,
who
wants
to
be
wiser
and
wittier
than
all
the
world!
I
wonder
how
she
speaks
of
the
Coles
what
she
calls
them!
How
can
she
find
any
appellation
for
them,
deep
enough
in
familiar
vulgarity?
She
calls
you,
Knightley
what
can
she
do
for
Mr.
Cole?
And
so
I
am
not
to
be
surprized
that
Jane
Fairfax
accepts
her
civilities
and
consents
to
be
with
her.
Mrs.
Weston,
your
argument
weighs
most
with
me.
I
can
much
more
readily
enter
into
the
temptation
of
getting
away
from
Miss
Bates,
than
I
can
believe
in
the
triumph
of
Miss
Fairfax's
mind
over
Mrs.
Elton.
I
have
no
faith
in
Mrs.
Elton's
acknowledging
herself
the
inferior
in
thought,
word,
or
deed;
or
in
her
being
under
any
restraint
beyond
her
own
scanty
rule
of
good
breeding.
I
cannot
imagine
that
she
will
not
be
continually
insulting
her
visitor
with
praise,
encouragement,
and
offers
of
service;
that
she
will
not
be
continually
detailing
her
magnificent
intentions,
from
the
procuring
her
a
permanent
situation
to
the
including
her
in
those
delightful
exploring
parties
which
are
to
take
place
in
the
barouche
landau."
"Jane
Fairfax
has
feeling,"
said
Mr.
Knightley
"I
do
not
accuse
her
of
want
of
feeling.
Her
sensibilities,
I
suspect,
are
strong
and
her
temper
excellent
in
its
power
of
forbearance,
patience,
self
control;
but
it
wants
openness.
She
is
reserved,
more
reserved,
I
think,
than
she
used
to
be
And
I
love
an
open
temper.
No
till
Cole
alluded
to
my
supposed
attachment,
it
had
never
entered
my
head.
I
saw
Jane
Fairfax
and
conversed
with
her,
with
admiration
and
pleasure
always
but
with
no
thought
beyond."
"Well,
Mrs.
Weston,"
said
Emma
triumphantly
when
he
left
them,
"what
do
you
say
now
to
Mr.
Knightley's
marrying
Jane
Fairfax?"
"Why,
really,
dear
Emma,
I
say
that
he
is
so
very
much
occupied
by
the
idea
of
not
being
in
love
with
her,
that
I
should
not
wonder
if
it
were
to
end
