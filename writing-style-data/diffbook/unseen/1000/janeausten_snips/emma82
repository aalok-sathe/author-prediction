then
in
taking
the
dimensions
of
the
other
parlour,
in
the
hope
of
discovering,
in
spite
of
all
that
Mr.
Weston
could
say
of
their
exactly
equal
size,
that
it
was
a
little
the
largest.
His
first
proposition
and
request,
that
the
dance
begun
at
Mr.
Cole's
should
be
finished
there
that
the
same
party
should
be
collected,
and
the
same
musician
engaged,
met
with
the
readiest
acquiescence.
Mr.
Weston
entered
into
the
idea
with
thorough
enjoyment,
and
Mrs.
Weston
most
willingly
undertook
to
play
as
long
as
they
could
wish
to
dance;
and
the
interesting
employment
had
followed,
of
reckoning
up
exactly
who
there
would
be,
and
portioning
out
the
indispensable
division
of
space
to
every
couple.
"You
and
Miss
Smith,
and
Miss
Fairfax,
will
be
three,
and
the
two
Miss
Coxes
five,"
had
been
repeated
many
times
over.
"And
there
will
be
the
two
Gilberts,
young
Cox,
my
father,
and
myself,
besides
Mr.
Knightley.
Yes,
that
will
be
quite
enough
for
pleasure.
You
and
Miss
Smith,
and
Miss
Fairfax,
will
be
three,
and
the
two
Miss
Coxes
five;
and
for
five
couple
there
will
be
plenty
of
room."
But
soon
it
came
to
be
on
one
side,
"But
will
there
be
good
room
for
five
couple?
I
really
do
not
think
there
will."
On
another,
"And
after
all,
five
couple
are
not
enough
to
make
it
worth
while
to
stand
up.
Five
couple
are
nothing,
when
one
thinks
seriously
about
it.
It
will
not
do
to
invite
five
couple.
It
can
be
allowable
only
as
the
thought
of
the
moment."
Somebody
said
that
Miss
Gilbert
was
expected
at
her
brother's,
and
must
be
invited
with
the
rest.
Somebody
else
believed
Mrs.
Gilbert
would
have
danced
the
other
evening,
if
she
had
been
asked.
A
word
was
put
in
for
a
second
young
Cox;
and
at
last,
Mr.
Weston
naming
one
family
of
cousins
who
must
be
included,
and
another
of
very
old
acquaintance
who
could
not
be
left
out,
it
became
a
certainty
that
the
five
couple
would
be
at
least
ten,
and
a
very
interesting
speculation
in
what
possible
manner
they
could
be
disposed
of.
The
doors
of
the
two
rooms
were
just
opposite
each
other.
"Might
not
they
use
both
rooms,
and
dance
across
the
passage?"
It
seemed
the
best
scheme;
and
yet
it
was
not
so
good
but
that
many
of
them
wanted
a
better.
Emma
said
it
would
be
awkward;
Mrs.
Weston
was
in
distress
about
the
supper;
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
opposed
it
earnestly,
on
the
score
of
health.
It
made
him
so
very
unhappy,
indeed,
that
it
could
not
be
persevered
in.
"Oh!
no,"
said
he;
"it
would
be
the
extreme
of
imprudence.
I
could
not
bear
it
for
Emma!
Emma
is
not
strong.
She
would
catch
a
dreadful
cold.
So
would
poor
little
Harriet.
So
you
would
all.
Mrs.
Weston,
you
would
be
quite
laid
up;
do
not
let
them
talk
of
such
a
wild
thing.
Pray
do
not
let
them
talk
of
it.
That
young
man
(speaking
lower)
is
very
thoughtless.
Do
not
tell
his
father,
but
that
young
man
is
not
quite
the
thing.
He
has
been
opening
the
doors
very
often
this
evening,
and
keeping
them
open
very
inconsiderately.
He
does
not
think
of
the
draught.
I
do
not
mean
to
set
you
against
him,
but
indeed
he
is
not
quite
the
thing!"
Mrs.
Weston
was
sorry
for
such
a
charge.
She
knew
the
importance
of
it,
and
said
every
thing
in
her
power
to
do
it
away.
Every
door
was
now
closed,
the
passage
plan
given
up,
and
the
first
scheme
of
dancing
only
in
the
room
they
were
in
resorted
to
again;
and
with
such
good
will
on
Frank
Churchill's
part,
that
the
space
which
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
had
been
deemed
barely
sufficient
for
five
couple,
was
now
endeavoured
to
be
made
out
quite
enough
for
ten.
"We
were
too
magnificent,"
said
he.
"We
allowed
unnecessary
room.
Ten
couple
may
stand
here
very
well."
Emma
demurred.
"It
would
be
a
crowd
a
sad
crowd;
and
what
could
be
worse
than
dancing
without
space
to
turn
in?"
"Very
true,"
he
gravely
replied;
"it
was
very
bad."
But
still
he
went
on
measuring,
and
still
he
ended
with,
"I
think
there
will
be
very
tolerable
room
for
ten
couple."
"No,
no,"
said
she,
"you
are
quite
unreasonable.
It
would
be
dreadful
to
be
standing
so
close!
Nothing
can
be
farther
from
pleasure
than
to
be
dancing
in
a
crowd
and
a
crowd
in
a
little
room!"
"There
is
no
denying
it,"
he
replied.
"I
agree
with
you
exactly.
A
crowd
in
a
little
room
Miss
Woodhouse,
you
have
the
art
of
giving
pictures
in
a
few
words.
Exquisite,
quite
exquisite!
Still,
however,
having
proceeded
so
far,
one
is
unwilling
to
give
the
matter
up.
It
would
be
a
disappointment
to
my
father
and
altogether
I
do
not
know
that
I
am
rather
of
opinion
that
ten
couple
might
stand
here
very
well."
Emma
perceived
that
the
nature
of
his
gallantry
was
a
little
self
willed,
and
that
he
would
rather
oppose
than
lose
the
pleasure
of
dancing
with
her;
but
she
took
the
compliment,
and
forgave
the
rest.
Had
she
intended
ever
to
marry
him,
it
might
have
been
worth
while
to
pause
and
consider,
and
try
to
understand
the
value
of
his
preference,
and
the
character
of
his
temper;
but
for
all
the
purposes
of
their
acquaintance,
he
was
quite
amiable
enough.
Before
the
middle
of
the
next
day,
he
was
at
Hartfield;
and
he
entered
the
room
with
such
an
agreeable
smile
as
certified
the
continuance
of
the
scheme.
It
soon
appeared
that
he
came
to
announce
an
improvement.
"Well,
Miss
Woodhouse,"
he
almost
immediately
began,
"your
inclination
for
dancing
has
not
been
quite
frightened
away,
I
hope,
by
the
terrors
of
my
father's
little
rooms.
I
bring
a
new
proposal
on
the
subject:
a
thought
of
my
father's,
which
waits
only
your
approbation
