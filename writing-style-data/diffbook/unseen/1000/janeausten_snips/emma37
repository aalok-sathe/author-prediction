way
to
it
and
this
must
be
the
case
with
Mr.
Elton;
a
most
valuable,
amiable,
pleasing
young
man
undoubtedly,
and
very
much
in
love
with
Harriet;
but
still,
he
cannot
refuse
an
invitation,
he
must
dine
out
wherever
he
is
asked.
What
a
strange
thing
love
is!
he
can
see
ready
wit
in
Harriet,
but
will
not
dine
alone
for
her."
Soon
afterwards
Mr.
Elton
quitted
them,
and
she
could
not
but
do
him
the
justice
of
feeling
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
sentiment
in
his
manner
of
naming
Harriet
at
parting;
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
while
assuring
her
that
he
should
call
at
Mrs.
Goddard's
for
news
of
her
fair
friend,
the
last
thing
before
he
prepared
for
the
happiness
of
meeting
her
again,
when
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
give
a
better
report;
and
he
sighed
and
smiled
himself
off
in
a
way
that
left
the
balance
of
approbation
much
in
his
favour.
After
a
few
minutes
of
entire
silence
between
them,
John
Knightley
began
with
"I
never
in
my
life
saw
a
man
more
intent
on
being
agreeable
than
Mr.
Elton.
It
is
downright
labour
to
him
where
ladies
are
concerned.
With
men
he
can
be
rational
and
unaffected,
but
when
he
has
ladies
to
please,
every
feature
works."
"Mr.
Elton's
manners
are
not
perfect,"
replied
Emma;
"but
where
there
is
a
wish
to
please,
one
ought
to
overlook,
and
one
does
overlook
a
great
deal.
Where
a
man
does
his
best
with
only
moderate
powers,
he
will
have
the
advantage
over
negligent
superiority.
There
is
such
perfect
good
temper
and
good
will
in
Mr.
Elton
as
one
cannot
but
value."
"Yes,"
said
Mr.
John
Knightley
presently,
with
some
slyness,
"he
seems
to
have
a
great
deal
of
good
will
towards
you."
"Me!"
she
replied
with
a
smile
of
astonishment,
"are
you
imagining
me
to
be
Mr.
Elton's
object?"
"Such
an
imagination
has
crossed
me,
I
own,
Emma;
and
if
it
never
occurred
to
you
before,
you
may
as
well
take
it
into
consideration
now."
"Mr.
Elton
in
love
with
me!
What
an
idea!"
"I
do
not
say
it
is
so;
but
you
will
do
well
to
consider
whether
it
is
so
or
not,
and
to
regulate
your
behaviour
accordingly.
I
think
your
manners
to
him
encouraging.
I
speak
as
a
friend,
Emma.
You
had
better
look
about
you,
and
ascertain
what
you
do,
and
what
you
mean
to
do."
"I
thank
you;
but
I
assure
you
you
are
quite
mistaken.
Mr.
Elton
and
I
are
very
good
friends,
and
nothing
more;"
and
she
walked
on,
amusing
herself
in
the
consideration
of
the
blunders
which
often
arise
from
a
partial
knowledge
of
circumstances,
of
the
mistakes
which
people
of
high
pretensions
to
judgment
are
for
ever
falling
into;
and
not
very
well
pleased
with
her
brother
for
imagining
her
blind
and
ignorant,
and
in
want
of
counsel.
He
said
no
more.
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
so
completely
made
up
his
mind
to
the
visit,
that
in
spite
of
the
increasing
coldness,
he
seemed
to
have
no
idea
of
shrinking
from
it,
and
set
forward
at
last
most
punctually
with
his
eldest
daughter
in
his
own
carriage,
with
less
apparent
consciousness
of
the
weather
than
either
of
the
others;
too
full
of
the
wonder
of
his
own
going,
and
the
pleasure
it
was
to
afford
at
Randalls
to
see
that
it
was
cold,
and
too
well
wrapt
up
to
feel
it.
The
cold,
however,
was
severe;
and
by
the
time
the
second
carriage
was
in
motion,
a
few
flakes
of
snow
were
finding
their
way
down,
and
the
sky
had
the
appearance
of
being
so
overcharged
as
to
want
only
a
milder
air
to
produce
a
very
white
world
in
a
very
short
time.
Emma
soon
saw
that
her
companion
was
not
in
the
happiest
humour.
The
preparing
and
the
going
abroad
in
such
weather,
with
the
sacrifice
of
his
children
after
dinner,
were
evils,
were
disagreeables
at
least,
which
Mr.
John
Knightley
did
not
by
any
means
like;
he
anticipated
nothing
in
the
visit
that
could
be
at
all
worth
the
purchase;
and
the
whole
of
their
drive
to
the
vicarage
was
spent
by
him
in
expressing
his
discontent.
"A
man,"
said
he,
"must
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
himself
when
he
asks
people
to
leave
their
own
fireside,
and
encounter
such
a
day
as
this,
for
the
sake
of
coming
to
see
him.
He
must
think
himself
a
most
agreeable
fellow;
I
could
not
do
such
a
thing.
It
is
the
greatest
absurdity
Actually
snowing
at
this
moment!
The
folly
of
not
allowing
people
to
be
comfortable
at
home
and
the
folly
of
people's
not
staying
comfortably
at
home
when
they
can!
If
we
were
obliged
to
go
out
such
an
evening
as
this,
by
any
call
of
duty
or
business,
what
a
hardship
we
should
deem
it;
and
here
are
we,
probably
with
rather
thinner
clothing
than
usual,
setting
forward
voluntarily,
without
excuse,
in
defiance
of
the
voice
of
nature,
which
tells
man,
in
every
thing
given
to
his
view
or
his
feelings,
to
stay
at
home
himself,
and
keep
all
under
shelter
that
he
can;
here
are
we
setting
forward
to
spend
five
dull
hours
in
another
man's
house,
with
nothing
to
say
or
to
hear
that
was
not
said
and
heard
yesterday,
and
may
not
be
said
and
heard
again
to
morrow.
Going
in
dismal
weather,
to
return
probably
in
worse;
four
horses
and
four
servants
taken
out
for
nothing
but
to
convey
five
idle,
shivering
creatures
into
colder
rooms
and
worse
company
than
they
might
have
had
at
home."
Emma
did
not
find
herself
equal
to
give
the
pleased
assent,
which
no
doubt
he
was
in
the
habit
of
receiving,
to
emulate
the
"Very
true,
my
love,"
which
must
have
been
usually
administered
by
his
travelling
companion;
but
she
had
resolution
enough
to
refrain
from
making
any
answer
at
all.
She
could
not
be
complying,
she
