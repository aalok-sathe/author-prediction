He
wanted
her
to
look
up
and
smile;
and
having
now
brought
herself
not
to
smile
too
broadly
she
did
cheerfully
answering,
"You
need
not
be
at
any
pains
to
reconcile
me
to
the
match.
I
think
Harriet
is
doing
extremely
well.
Her
connexions
may
be
worse
than
his.
In
respectability
of
character,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
are.
I
have
been
silent
from
surprize
merely,
excessive
surprize.
You
cannot
imagine
how
suddenly
it
has
come
on
me!
how
peculiarly
unprepared
I
was!
for
I
had
reason
to
believe
her
very
lately
more
determined
against
him,
much
more,
than
she
was
before."
"You
ought
to
know
your
friend
best,"
replied
Mr.
Knightley;
"but
I
should
say
she
was
a
good
tempered,
soft
hearted
girl,
not
likely
to
be
very,
very
determined
against
any
young
man
who
told
her
he
loved
her."
Emma
could
not
help
laughing
as
she
answered,
"Upon
my
word,
I
believe
you
know
her
quite
as
well
as
I
do.
But,
Mr.
Knightley,
are
you
perfectly
sure
that
she
has
absolutely
and
downright
accepted
him.
I
could
suppose
she
might
in
time
but
can
she
already?
Did
not
you
misunderstand
him?
You
were
both
talking
of
other
things;
of
business,
shows
of
cattle,
or
new
drills
and
might
not
you,
in
the
confusion
of
so
many
subjects,
mistake
him?
It
was
not
Harriet's
hand
that
he
was
certain
of
it
was
the
dimensions
of
some
famous
ox."
The
contrast
between
the
countenance
and
air
of
Mr.
Knightley
and
Robert
Martin
was,
at
this
moment,
so
strong
to
Emma's
feelings,
and
so
strong
was
the
recollection
of
all
that
had
so
recently
passed
on
Harriet's
side,
so
fresh
the
sound
of
those
words,
spoken
with
such
emphasis,
"No,
I
hope
I
know
better
than
to
think
of
Robert
Martin,"
that
she
was
really
expecting
the
intelligence
to
prove,
in
some
measure,
premature.
It
could
not
be
otherwise.
"Do
you
dare
say
this?"
cried
Mr.
Knightley.
"Do
you
dare
to
suppose
me
so
great
a
blockhead,
as
not
to
know
what
a
man
is
talking
of?
What
do
you
deserve?"
"Oh!
I
always
deserve
the
best
treatment,
because
I
never
put
up
with
any
other;
and,
therefore,
you
must
give
me
a
plain,
direct
answer.
Are
you
quite
sure
that
you
understand
the
terms
on
which
Mr.
Martin
and
Harriet
now
are?"
"I
am
quite
sure,"
he
replied,
speaking
very
distinctly,
"that
he
told
me
she
had
accepted
him;
and
that
there
was
no
obscurity,
nothing
doubtful,
in
the
words
he
used;
and
I
think
I
can
give
you
a
proof
that
it
must
be
so.
He
asked
my
opinion
as
to
what
he
was
now
to
do.
He
knew
of
no
one
but
Mrs.
Goddard
to
whom
he
could
apply
for
information
of
her
relations
or
friends.
Could
I
mention
any
thing
more
fit
to
be
done,
than
to
go
to
Mrs.
Goddard?
I
assured
him
that
I
could
not.
Then,
he
said,
he
would
endeavour
to
see
her
in
the
course
of
this
day."
"I
am
perfectly
satisfied,"
replied
Emma,
with
the
brightest
smiles,
"and
most
sincerely
wish
them
happy."
"You
are
materially
changed
since
we
talked
on
this
subject
before."
"I
hope
so
for
at
that
time
I
was
a
fool."
"And
I
am
changed
also;
for
I
am
now
very
willing
to
grant
you
all
Harriet's
good
qualities.
I
have
taken
some
pains
for
your
sake,
and
for
Robert
Martin's
sake,
(whom
I
have
always
had
reason
to
believe
as
much
in
love
with
her
as
ever,)
to
get
acquainted
with
her.
I
have
often
talked
to
her
a
good
deal.
You
must
have
seen
that
I
did.
Sometimes,
indeed,
I
have
thought
you
were
half
suspecting
me
of
pleading
poor
Martin's
cause,
which
was
never
the
case;
but,
from
all
my
observations,
I
am
convinced
of
her
being
an
artless,
amiable
girl,
with
very
good
notions,
very
seriously
good
principles,
and
placing
her
happiness
in
the
affections
and
utility
of
domestic
life.
Much
of
this,
I
have
no
doubt,
she
may
thank
you
for."
"Me!"
cried
Emma,
shaking
her
head.
"Ah!
poor
Harriet!"
She
checked
herself,
however,
and
submitted
quietly
to
a
little
more
praise
than
she
deserved.
Their
conversation
was
soon
afterwards
closed
by
the
entrance
of
her
father.
She
was
not
sorry.
She
wanted
to
be
alone.
Her
mind
was
in
a
state
of
flutter
and
wonder,
which
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
be
collected.
She
was
in
dancing,
singing,
exclaiming
spirits;
and
till
she
had
moved
about,
and
talked
to
herself,
and
laughed
and
reflected,
she
could
be
fit
for
nothing
rational.
Her
father's
business
was
to
announce
James's
being
gone
out
to
put
the
horses
to,
preparatory
to
their
now
daily
drive
to
Randalls;
and
she
had,
therefore,
an
immediate
excuse
for
disappearing.
The
joy,
the
gratitude,
the
exquisite
delight
of
her
sensations
may
be
imagined.
The
sole
grievance
and
alloy
thus
removed
in
the
prospect
of
Harriet's
welfare,
she
was
really
in
danger
of
becoming
too
happy
for
security.
What
had
she
to
wish
for?
Nothing,
but
to
grow
more
worthy
of
him,
whose
intentions
and
judgment
had
been
ever
so
superior
to
her
own.
Nothing,
but
that
the
lessons
of
her
past
folly
might
teach
her
humility
and
circumspection
in
future.
Serious
she
was,
very
serious
in
her
thankfulness,
and
in
her
resolutions;
and
yet
there
was
no
preventing
a
laugh,
sometimes
in
the
very
midst
of
them.
She
must
laugh
at
such
a
close!
Such
an
end
of
the
doleful
disappointment
of
five
weeks
back!
Such
a
heart
such
a
Harriet!
Now
there
would
be
pleasure
in
her
returning
Every
thing
would
be
a
pleasure.
It
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
know
Robert
Martin.
High
in
the
rank
of
her
most
serious
and
heartfelt
felicities,
was
the
reflection
that
all
necessity
of
concealment
from
Mr.
Knightley
would
soon
be
over.
The
disguise,
equivocation,
mystery,
so
hateful
to
her
to
practise,
might
soon
be
