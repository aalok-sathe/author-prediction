me
read
it
to
him."
Harriet
looked
grave.
"My
dear
Harriet,
you
must
not
refine
too
much
upon
this
charade.
You
will
betray
your
feelings
improperly,
if
you
are
too
conscious
and
too
quick,
and
appear
to
affix
more
meaning,
or
even
quite
all
the
meaning
which
may
be
affixed
to
it.
Do
not
be
overpowered
by
such
a
little
tribute
of
admiration.
If
he
had
been
anxious
for
secrecy,
he
would
not
have
left
the
paper
while
I
was
by;
but
he
rather
pushed
it
towards
me
than
towards
you.
Do
not
let
us
be
too
solemn
on
the
business.
He
has
encouragement
enough
to
proceed,
without
our
sighing
out
our
souls
over
this
charade."
"Oh!
no
I
hope
I
shall
not
be
ridiculous
about
it.
Do
as
you
please."
Mr.
Woodhouse
came
in,
and
very
soon
led
to
the
subject
again,
by
the
recurrence
of
his
very
frequent
inquiry
of
"Well,
my
dears,
how
does
your
book
go
on?
Have
you
got
any
thing
fresh?"
"Yes,
papa;
we
have
something
to
read
you,
something
quite
fresh.
A
piece
of
paper
was
found
on
the
table
this
morning
(dropt,
we
suppose,
by
a
fairy)
containing
a
very
pretty
charade,
and
we
have
just
copied
it
in."
She
read
it
to
him,
just
as
he
liked
to
have
any
thing
read,
slowly
and
distinctly,
and
two
or
three
times
over,
with
explanations
of
every
part
as
she
proceeded
and
he
was
very
much
pleased,
and,
as
she
had
foreseen,
especially
struck
with
the
complimentary
conclusion.
"Aye,
that's
very
just,
indeed,
that's
very
properly
said.
Very
true.
'Woman,
lovely
woman.'
It
is
such
a
pretty
charade,
my
dear,
that
I
can
easily
guess
what
fairy
brought
it.
Nobody
could
have
written
so
prettily,
but
you,
Emma."
Emma
only
nodded,
and
smiled.
After
a
little
thinking,
and
a
very
tender
sigh,
he
added,
"Ah!
it
is
no
difficulty
to
see
who
you
take
after!
Your
dear
mother
was
so
clever
at
all
those
things!
If
I
had
but
her
memory!
But
I
can
remember
nothing;
not
even
that
particular
riddle
which
you
have
heard
me
mention;
I
can
only
recollect
the
first
stanza;
and
there
are
several.
Kitty,
a
fair
but
frozen
maid,
Kindled
a
flame
I
yet
deplore,
The
hood
wink'd
boy
I
called
to
aid,
Though
of
his
near
approach
afraid,
So
fatal
to
my
suit
before.
And
that
is
all
that
I
can
recollect
of
it
but
it
is
very
clever
all
the
way
through.
But
I
think,
my
dear,
you
said
you
had
got
it."
"Yes,
papa,
it
is
written
out
in
our
second
page.
We
copied
it
from
the
Elegant
Extracts.
It
was
Garrick's,
you
know."
"Aye,
very
true.
I
wish
I
could
recollect
more
of
it.
Kitty,
a
fair
but
frozen
maid.
The
name
makes
me
think
of
poor
Isabella;
for
she
was
very
near
being
christened
Catherine
after
her
grandmama.
I
hope
we
shall
have
her
here
next
week.
Have
you
thought,
my
dear,
where
you
shall
put
her
and
what
room
there
will
be
for
the
children?"
"Oh!
yes
she
will
have
her
own
room,
of
course;
the
room
she
always
has;
and
there
is
the
nursery
for
the
children,
just
as
usual,
you
know.
Why
should
there
be
any
change?"
"I
do
not
know,
my
dear
but
it
is
so
long
since
she
was
here!
not
since
last
Easter,
and
then
only
for
a
few
days.
Mr.
John
Knightley's
being
a
lawyer
is
very
inconvenient.
Poor
Isabella!
she
is
sadly
taken
away
from
us
all!
and
how
sorry
she
will
be
when
she
comes,
not
to
see
Miss
Taylor
here!"
"She
will
not
be
surprized,
papa,
at
least."
"I
do
not
know,
my
dear.
I
am
sure
I
was
very
much
surprized
when
I
first
heard
she
was
going
to
be
married."
"We
must
ask
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
to
dine
with
us,
while
Isabella
is
here."
"Yes,
my
dear,
if
there
is
time.
But
(in
a
very
depressed
tone)
she
is
coming
for
only
one
week.
There
will
not
be
time
for
any
thing."
"It
is
unfortunate
that
they
cannot
stay
longer
but
it
seems
a
case
of
necessity.
Mr.
John
Knightley
must
be
in
town
again
on
the
28th,
and
we
ought
to
be
thankful,
papa,
that
we
are
to
have
the
whole
of
the
time
they
can
give
to
the
country,
that
two
or
three
days
are
not
to
be
taken
out
for
the
Abbey.
Mr.
Knightley
promises
to
give
up
his
claim
this
Christmas
though
you
know
it
is
longer
since
they
were
with
him,
than
with
us."
"It
would
be
very
hard,
indeed,
my
dear,
if
poor
Isabella
were
to
be
anywhere
but
at
Hartfield."
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
never
allow
for
Mr.
Knightley's
claims
on
his
brother,
or
any
body's
claims
on
Isabella,
except
his
own.
He
sat
musing
a
little
while,
and
then
said,
"But
I
do
not
see
why
poor
Isabella
should
be
obliged
to
go
back
so
soon,
though
he
does.
I
think,
Emma,
I
shall
try
and
persuade
her
to
stay
longer
with
us.
She
and
the
children
might
stay
very
well."
"Ah!
papa
that
is
what
you
never
have
been
able
to
accomplish,
and
I
do
not
think
you
ever
will.
Isabella
cannot
bear
to
stay
behind
her
husband."
This
was
too
true
for
contradiction.
Unwelcome
as
it
was,
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
only
give
a
submissive
sigh;
and
as
Emma
saw
his
spirits
affected
by
the
idea
of
his
daughter's
attachment
to
her
husband,
she
immediately
led
to
such
a
branch
of
the
subject
as
must
raise
them.
"Harriet
must
give
us
as
much
of
her
company
as
she
can
while
my
brother
and
sister
are
here.
I
am
sure
she
will
be
pleased
with
the
children.
We
are
very
proud
of
the
children,
are
not
we,
papa?
I
wonder
which
she
will
think
the
handsomest,
Henry
or
John?"
"Aye,
I
wonder
which
she
will.
Poor
little
dears,
how
glad
they
will
be
