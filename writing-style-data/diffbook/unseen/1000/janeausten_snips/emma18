to
her,
for
the
clownish
manner
which
might
be
offending
her
every
hour
of
the
day,
to
know
that
her
husband
could
write
a
good
letter."
"Oh!
yes,
very.
Nobody
cares
for
a
letter;
the
thing
is,
to
be
always
happy
with
pleasant
companions.
I
am
quite
determined
to
refuse
him.
But
how
shall
I
do?
What
shall
I
say?"
Emma
assured
her
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
the
answer,
and
advised
its
being
written
directly,
which
was
agreed
to,
in
the
hope
of
her
assistance;
and
though
Emma
continued
to
protest
against
any
assistance
being
wanted,
it
was
in
fact
given
in
the
formation
of
every
sentence.
The
looking
over
his
letter
again,
in
replying
to
it,
had
such
a
softening
tendency,
that
it
was
particularly
necessary
to
brace
her
up
with
a
few
decisive
expressions;
and
she
was
so
very
much
concerned
at
the
idea
of
making
him
unhappy,
and
thought
so
much
of
what
his
mother
and
sisters
would
think
and
say,
and
was
so
anxious
that
they
should
not
fancy
her
ungrateful,
that
Emma
believed
if
the
young
man
had
come
in
her
way
at
that
moment,
he
would
have
been
accepted
after
all.
This
letter,
however,
was
written,
and
sealed,
and
sent.
The
business
was
finished,
and
Harriet
safe.
She
was
rather
low
all
the
evening,
but
Emma
could
allow
for
her
amiable
regrets,
and
sometimes
relieved
them
by
speaking
of
her
own
affection,
sometimes
by
bringing
forward
the
idea
of
Mr.
Elton.
"I
shall
never
be
invited
to
Abbey
Mill
again,"
was
said
in
rather
a
sorrowful
tone.
"Nor,
if
you
were,
could
I
ever
bear
to
part
with
you,
my
Harriet.
You
are
a
great
deal
too
necessary
at
Hartfield
to
be
spared
to
Abbey
Mill."
"And
I
am
sure
I
should
never
want
to
go
there;
for
I
am
never
happy
but
at
Hartfield."
Some
time
afterwards
it
was,
"I
think
Mrs.
Goddard
would
be
very
much
surprized
if
she
knew
what
had
happened.
I
am
sure
Miss
Nash
would
for
Miss
Nash
thinks
her
own
sister
very
well
married,
and
it
is
only
a
linen
draper."
"One
should
be
sorry
to
see
greater
pride
or
refinement
in
the
teacher
of
a
school,
Harriet.
I
dare
say
Miss
Nash
would
envy
you
such
an
opportunity
as
this
of
being
married.
Even
this
conquest
would
appear
valuable
in
her
eyes.
As
to
any
thing
superior
for
you,
I
suppose
she
is
quite
in
the
dark.
The
attentions
of
a
certain
person
can
hardly
be
among
the
tittle
tattle
of
Highbury
yet.
Hitherto
I
fancy
you
and
I
are
the
only
people
to
whom
his
looks
and
manners
have
explained
themselves."
Harriet
blushed
and
smiled,
and
said
something
about
wondering
that
people
should
like
her
so
much.
The
idea
of
Mr.
Elton
was
certainly
cheering;
but
still,
after
a
time,
she
was
tender
hearted
again
towards
the
rejected
Mr.
Martin.
"Now
he
has
got
my
letter,"
said
she
softly.
"I
wonder
what
they
are
all
doing
whether
his
sisters
know
if
he
is
unhappy,
they
will
be
unhappy
too.
I
hope
he
will
not
mind
it
so
very
much."
"Let
us
think
of
those
among
our
absent
friends
who
are
more
cheerfully
employed,"
cried
Emma.
"At
this
moment,
perhaps,
Mr.
Elton
is
shewing
your
picture
to
his
mother
and
sisters,
telling
how
much
more
beautiful
is
the
original,
and
after
being
asked
for
it
five
or
six
times,
allowing
them
to
hear
your
name,
your
own
dear
name."
"My
picture!
But
he
has
left
my
picture
in
Bond
street."
"Has
he
so!
Then
I
know
nothing
of
Mr.
Elton.
No,
my
dear
little
modest
Harriet,
depend
upon
it
the
picture
will
not
be
in
Bond
street
till
just
before
he
mounts
his
horse
to
morrow.
It
is
his
companion
all
this
evening,
his
solace,
his
delight.
It
opens
his
designs
to
his
family,
it
introduces
you
among
them,
it
diffuses
through
the
party
those
pleasantest
feelings
of
our
nature,
eager
curiosity
and
warm
prepossession.
How
cheerful,
how
animated,
how
suspicious,
how
busy
their
imaginations
all
are!"
Harriet
smiled
again,
and
her
smiles
grew
stronger.
Harriet
slept
at
Hartfield
that
night.
For
some
weeks
past
she
had
been
spending
more
than
half
her
time
there,
and
gradually
getting
to
have
a
bed
room
appropriated
to
herself;
and
Emma
judged
it
best
in
every
respect,
safest
and
kindest,
to
keep
her
with
them
as
much
as
possible
just
at
present.
She
was
obliged
to
go
the
next
morning
for
an
hour
or
two
to
Mrs.
Goddard's,
but
it
was
then
to
be
settled
that
she
should
return
to
Hartfield,
to
make
a
regular
visit
of
some
days.
While
she
was
gone,
Mr.
Knightley
called,
and
sat
some
time
with
Mr.
Woodhouse
and
Emma,
till
Mr.
Woodhouse,
who
had
previously
made
up
his
mind
to
walk
out,
was
persuaded
by
his
daughter
not
to
defer
it,
and
was
induced
by
the
entreaties
of
both,
though
against
the
scruples
of
his
own
civility,
to
leave
Mr.
Knightley
for
that
purpose.
Mr.
Knightley,
who
had
nothing
of
ceremony
about
him,
was
offering
by
his
short,
decided
answers,
an
amusing
contrast
to
the
protracted
apologies
and
civil
hesitations
of
the
other.
"Well,
I
believe,
if
you
will
excuse
me,
Mr.
Knightley,
if
you
will
not
consider
me
as
doing
a
very
rude
thing,
I
shall
take
Emma's
advice
and
go
out
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour.
As
the
sun
is
out,
I
believe
I
had
better
take
my
three
turns
while
I
can.
I
treat
you
without
ceremony,
Mr.
Knightley.
We
invalids
think
we
are
privileged
people."
"My
dear
sir,
do
not
make
a
stranger
of
me."
"I
leave
an
excellent
substitute
in
my
daughter.
Emma
will
be
happy
to
entertain
you.
And
therefore
I
think
I
will
beg
your
excuse
and
take
my
three
turns
my
winter
walk."
"You
cannot
do
better,
sir."
"I
would
ask
for
the
pleasure
of
your
company,
Mr.
Knightley,
but
I
am
