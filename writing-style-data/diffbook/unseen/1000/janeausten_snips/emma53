out,
quite
frightened,
with
'Bless
me!
poor
Jane
is
ill!'
which
my
mother,
being
on
the
watch,
heard
distinctly,
and
was
sadly
alarmed
at.
However,
when
I
read
on,
I
found
it
was
not
near
so
bad
as
I
had
fancied
at
first;
and
I
make
so
light
of
it
now
to
her,
that
she
does
not
think
much
about
it.
But
I
cannot
imagine
how
I
could
be
so
off
my
guard.
If
Jane
does
not
get
well
soon,
we
will
call
in
Mr.
Perry.
The
expense
shall
not
be
thought
of;
and
though
he
is
so
liberal,
and
so
fond
of
Jane
that
I
dare
say
he
would
not
mean
to
charge
any
thing
for
attendance,
we
could
not
suffer
it
to
be
so,
you
know.
He
has
a
wife
and
family
to
maintain,
and
is
not
to
be
giving
away
his
time.
Well,
now
I
have
just
given
you
a
hint
of
what
Jane
writes
about,
we
will
turn
to
her
letter,
and
I
am
sure
she
tells
her
own
story
a
great
deal
better
than
I
can
tell
it
for
her."
"I
am
afraid
we
must
be
running
away,"
said
Emma,
glancing
at
Harriet,
and
beginning
to
rise
"My
father
will
be
expecting
us.
I
had
no
intention,
I
thought
I
had
no
power
of
staying
more
than
five
minutes,
when
I
first
entered
the
house.
I
merely
called,
because
I
would
not
pass
the
door
without
inquiring
after
Mrs.
Bates;
but
I
have
been
so
pleasantly
detained!
Now,
however,
we
must
wish
you
and
Mrs.
Bates
good
morning."
And
not
all
that
could
be
urged
to
detain
her
succeeded.
She
regained
the
street
happy
in
this,
that
though
much
had
been
forced
on
her
against
her
will,
though
she
had
in
fact
heard
the
whole
substance
of
Jane
Fairfax's
letter,
she
had
been
able
to
escape
the
letter
itself.
Jane
Fairfax
was
an
orphan,
the
only
child
of
Mrs.
Bates's
youngest
daughter.
The
marriage
of
Lieut.
Fairfax
of
the
regiment
of
infantry,
and
Miss
Jane
Bates,
had
had
its
day
of
fame
and
pleasure,
hope
and
interest;
but
nothing
now
remained
of
it,
save
the
melancholy
remembrance
of
him
dying
in
action
abroad
of
his
widow
sinking
under
consumption
and
grief
soon
afterwards
and
this
girl.
By
birth
she
belonged
to
Highbury:
and
when
at
three
years
old,
on
losing
her
mother,
she
became
the
property,
the
charge,
the
consolation,
the
foundling
of
her
grandmother
and
aunt,
there
had
seemed
every
probability
of
her
being
permanently
fixed
there;
of
her
being
taught
only
what
very
limited
means
could
command,
and
growing
up
with
no
advantages
of
connexion
or
improvement,
to
be
engrafted
on
what
nature
had
given
her
in
a
pleasing
person,
good
understanding,
and
warm
hearted,
well
meaning
relations.
But
the
compassionate
feelings
of
a
friend
of
her
father
gave
a
change
to
her
destiny.
This
was
Colonel
Campbell,
who
had
very
highly
regarded
Fairfax,
as
an
excellent
officer
and
most
deserving
young
man;
and
farther,
had
been
indebted
to
him
for
such
attentions,
during
a
severe
camp
fever,
as
he
believed
had
saved
his
life.
These
were
claims
which
he
did
not
learn
to
overlook,
though
some
years
passed
away
from
the
death
of
poor
Fairfax,
before
his
own
return
to
England
put
any
thing
in
his
power.
When
he
did
return,
he
sought
out
the
child
and
took
notice
of
her.
He
was
a
married
man,
with
only
one
living
child,
a
girl,
about
Jane's
age:
and
Jane
became
their
guest,
paying
them
long
visits
and
growing
a
favourite
with
all;
and
before
she
was
nine
years
old,
his
daughter's
great
fondness
for
her,
and
his
own
wish
of
being
a
real
friend,
united
to
produce
an
offer
from
Colonel
Campbell
of
undertaking
the
whole
charge
of
her
education.
It
was
accepted;
and
from
that
period
Jane
had
belonged
to
Colonel
Campbell's
family,
and
had
lived
with
them
entirely,
only
visiting
her
grandmother
from
time
to
time.
The
plan
was
that
she
should
be
brought
up
for
educating
others;
the
very
few
hundred
pounds
which
she
inherited
from
her
father
making
independence
impossible.
To
provide
for
her
otherwise
was
out
of
Colonel
Campbell's
power;
for
though
his
income,
by
pay
and
appointments,
was
handsome,
his
fortune
was
moderate
and
must
be
all
his
daughter's;
but,
by
giving
her
an
education,
he
hoped
to
be
supplying
the
means
of
respectable
subsistence
hereafter.
Such
was
Jane
Fairfax's
history.
She
had
fallen
into
good
hands,
known
nothing
but
kindness
from
the
Campbells,
and
been
given
an
excellent
education.
Living
constantly
with
right
minded
and
well
informed
people,
her
heart
and
understanding
had
received
every
advantage
of
discipline
and
culture;
and
Colonel
Campbell's
residence
being
in
London,
every
lighter
talent
had
been
done
full
justice
to,
by
the
attendance
of
first
rate
masters.
Her
disposition
and
abilities
were
equally
worthy
of
all
that
friendship
could
do;
and
at
eighteen
or
nineteen
she
was,
as
far
as
such
an
early
age
can
be
qualified
for
the
care
of
children,
fully
competent
to
the
office
of
instruction
herself;
but
she
was
too
much
beloved
to
be
parted
with.
Neither
father
nor
mother
could
promote,
and
the
daughter
could
not
endure
it.
The
evil
day
was
put
off.
It
was
easy
to
decide
that
she
was
still
too
young;
and
Jane
remained
with
them,
sharing,
as
another
daughter,
in
all
the
rational
pleasures
of
an
elegant
society,
and
a
judicious
mixture
of
home
and
amusement,
with
only
the
drawback
of
the
future,
the
sobering
suggestions
of
her
own
good
understanding
to
remind
her
that
all
this
might
soon
be
over.
The
affection
of
the
whole
family,
the
warm
attachment
of
Miss
Campbell
in
particular,
was
the
more
honourable
to
each
party
from
the
circumstance
of
Jane's
decided
superiority
both
in
beauty
and
acquirements.
That
nature
had
given
it
in
feature
could
not
be
unseen
by
the
young
woman,
nor
could
her
higher
powers
of
mind
be
unfelt
by
the
