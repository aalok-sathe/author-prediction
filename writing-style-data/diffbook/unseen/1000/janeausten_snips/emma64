immediately
also,
saying,
"As
you
are
going
farther
on
business,
sir,
I
will
take
the
opportunity
of
paying
a
visit,
which
must
be
paid
some
day
or
other,
and
therefore
may
as
well
be
paid
now.
I
have
the
honour
of
being
acquainted
with
a
neighbour
of
yours,
(turning
to
Emma,)
a
lady
residing
in
or
near
Highbury;
a
family
of
the
name
of
Fairfax.
I
shall
have
no
difficulty,
I
suppose,
in
finding
the
house;
though
Fairfax,
I
believe,
is
not
the
proper
name
I
should
rather
say
Barnes,
or
Bates.
Do
you
know
any
family
of
that
name?"
"To
be
sure
we
do,"
cried
his
father;
"Mrs.
Bates
we
passed
her
house
I
saw
Miss
Bates
at
the
window.
True,
true,
you
are
acquainted
with
Miss
Fairfax;
I
remember
you
knew
her
at
Weymouth,
and
a
fine
girl
she
is.
Call
upon
her,
by
all
means."
"There
is
no
necessity
for
my
calling
this
morning,"
said
the
young
man;
"another
day
would
do
as
well;
but
there
was
that
degree
of
acquaintance
at
Weymouth
which
"
"Oh!
go
to
day,
go
to
day.
Do
not
defer
it.
What
is
right
to
be
done
cannot
be
done
too
soon.
And,
besides,
I
must
give
you
a
hint,
Frank;
any
want
of
attention
to
her
here
should
be
carefully
avoided.
You
saw
her
with
the
Campbells,
when
she
was
the
equal
of
every
body
she
mixed
with,
but
here
she
is
with
a
poor
old
grandmother,
who
has
barely
enough
to
live
on.
If
you
do
not
call
early
it
will
be
a
slight."
The
son
looked
convinced.
"I
have
heard
her
speak
of
the
acquaintance,"
said
Emma;
"she
is
a
very
elegant
young
woman."
He
agreed
to
it,
but
with
so
quiet
a
"Yes,"
as
inclined
her
almost
to
doubt
his
real
concurrence;
and
yet
there
must
be
a
very
distinct
sort
of
elegance
for
the
fashionable
world,
if
Jane
Fairfax
could
be
thought
only
ordinarily
gifted
with
it.
"If
you
were
never
particularly
struck
by
her
manners
before,"
said
she,
"I
think
you
will
to
day.
You
will
see
her
to
advantage;
see
her
and
hear
her
no,
I
am
afraid
you
will
not
hear
her
at
all,
for
she
has
an
aunt
who
never
holds
her
tongue."
"You
are
acquainted
with
Miss
Jane
Fairfax,
sir,
are
you?"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse,
always
the
last
to
make
his
way
in
conversation;
"then
give
me
leave
to
assure
you
that
you
will
find
her
a
very
agreeable
young
lady.
She
is
staying
here
on
a
visit
to
her
grandmama
and
aunt,
very
worthy
people;
I
have
known
them
all
my
life.
They
will
be
extremely
glad
to
see
you,
I
am
sure;
and
one
of
my
servants
shall
go
with
you
to
shew
you
the
way."
"My
dear
sir,
upon
no
account
in
the
world;
my
father
can
direct
me."
"But
your
father
is
not
going
so
far;
he
is
only
going
to
the
Crown,
quite
on
the
other
side
of
the
street,
and
there
are
a
great
many
houses;
you
might
be
very
much
at
a
loss,
and
it
is
a
very
dirty
walk,
unless
you
keep
on
the
footpath;
but
my
coachman
can
tell
you
where
you
had
best
cross
the
street."
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
still
declined
it,
looking
as
serious
as
he
could,
and
his
father
gave
his
hearty
support
by
calling
out,
"My
good
friend,
this
is
quite
unnecessary;
Frank
knows
a
puddle
of
water
when
he
sees
it,
and
as
to
Mrs.
Bates's,
he
may
get
there
from
the
Crown
in
a
hop,
step,
and
jump."
They
were
permitted
to
go
alone;
and
with
a
cordial
nod
from
one,
and
a
graceful
bow
from
the
other,
the
two
gentlemen
took
leave.
Emma
remained
very
well
pleased
with
this
beginning
of
the
acquaintance,
and
could
now
engage
to
think
of
them
all
at
Randalls
any
hour
of
the
day,
with
full
confidence
in
their
comfort.
The
next
morning
brought
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
again.
He
came
with
Mrs.
Weston,
to
whom
and
to
Highbury
he
seemed
to
take
very
cordially.
He
had
been
sitting
with
her,
it
appeared,
most
companionably
at
home,
till
her
usual
hour
of
exercise;
and
on
being
desired
to
chuse
their
walk,
immediately
fixed
on
Highbury.
"He
did
not
doubt
there
being
very
pleasant
walks
in
every
direction,
but
if
left
to
him,
he
should
always
chuse
the
same.
Highbury,
that
airy,
cheerful,
happy
looking
Highbury,
would
be
his
constant
attraction."
Highbury,
with
Mrs.
Weston,
stood
for
Hartfield;
and
she
trusted
to
its
bearing
the
same
construction
with
him.
They
walked
thither
directly.
Emma
had
hardly
expected
them:
for
Mr.
Weston,
who
had
called
in
for
half
a
minute,
in
order
to
hear
that
his
son
was
very
handsome,
knew
nothing
of
their
plans;
and
it
was
an
agreeable
surprize
to
her,
therefore,
to
perceive
them
walking
up
to
the
house
together,
arm
in
arm.
She
was
wanting
to
see
him
again,
and
especially
to
see
him
in
company
with
Mrs.
Weston,
upon
his
behaviour
to
whom
her
opinion
of
him
was
to
depend.
If
he
were
deficient
there,
nothing
should
make
amends
for
it.
But
on
seeing
them
together,
she
became
perfectly
satisfied.
It
was
not
merely
in
fine
words
or
hyperbolical
compliment
that
he
paid
his
duty;
nothing
could
be
more
proper
or
pleasing
than
his
whole
manner
to
her
nothing
could
more
agreeably
denote
his
wish
of
considering
her
as
a
friend
and
securing
her
affection.
And
there
was
time
enough
for
Emma
to
form
a
reasonable
judgment,
as
their
visit
included
all
the
rest
of
the
morning.
They
were
all
three
walking
about
together
for
an
hour
or
two
first
round
the
shrubberies
of
Hartfield,
and
afterwards
in
Highbury.
He
was
delighted
with
every
thing;
admired
Hartfield
sufficiently
for
Mr.
Woodhouse's
ear;
and
when
their
going
farther
was
resolved
on,
confessed
his
wish
to
be
made
acquainted
with
the
whole
village,
and
found
matter
of
commendation
and
interest
much
