again
to
be
quite
certain,
and
quite
mistress
of
the
lines,
and
then
passing
it
to
Harriet,
sat
happily
smiling,
and
saying
to
herself,
while
Harriet
was
puzzling
over
the
paper
in
all
the
confusion
of
hope
and
dulness,
"Very
well,
Mr.
Elton,
very
well
indeed.
I
have
read
worse
charades.
Courtship
a
very
good
hint.
I
give
you
credit
for
it.
This
is
feeling
your
way.
This
is
saying
very
plainly
'Pray,
Miss
Smith,
give
me
leave
to
pay
my
addresses
to
you.
Approve
my
charade
and
my
intentions
in
the
same
glance.'
May
its
approval
beam
in
that
soft
eye!
Harriet
exactly.
Soft
is
the
very
word
for
her
eye
of
all
epithets,
the
justest
that
could
be
given.
Thy
ready
wit
the
word
will
soon
supply.
Humph
Harriet's
ready
wit!
All
the
better.
A
man
must
be
very
much
in
love,
indeed,
to
describe
her
so.
Ah!
Mr.
Knightley,
I
wish
you
had
the
benefit
of
this;
I
think
this
would
convince
you.
For
once
in
your
life
you
would
be
obliged
to
own
yourself
mistaken.
An
excellent
charade
indeed!
and
very
much
to
the
purpose.
Things
must
come
to
a
crisis
soon
now."
She
was
obliged
to
break
off
from
these
very
pleasant
observations,
which
were
otherwise
of
a
sort
to
run
into
great
length,
by
the
eagerness
of
Harriet's
wondering
questions.
"What
can
it
be,
Miss
Woodhouse?
what
can
it
be?
I
have
not
an
idea
I
cannot
guess
it
in
the
least.
What
can
it
possibly
be?
Do
try
to
find
it
out,
Miss
Woodhouse.
Do
help
me.
I
never
saw
any
thing
so
hard.
Is
it
kingdom?
I
wonder
who
the
friend
was
and
who
could
be
the
young
lady.
Do
you
think
it
is
a
good
one?
Can
it
be
woman?
And
woman,
lovely
woman,
reigns
alone.
Can
it
be
Neptune?
Behold
him
there,
the
monarch
of
the
seas!
Or
a
trident?
or
a
mermaid?
or
a
shark?
Oh,
no!
shark
is
only
one
syllable.
It
must
be
very
clever,
or
he
would
not
have
brought
it.
Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
do
you
think
we
shall
ever
find
it
out?"
"Mermaids
and
sharks!
Nonsense!
My
dear
Harriet,
what
are
you
thinking
of?
Where
would
be
the
use
of
his
bringing
us
a
charade
made
by
a
friend
upon
a
mermaid
or
a
shark?
Give
me
the
paper
and
listen.
For
Miss
,
read
Miss
Smith.
My
first
displays
the
wealth
and
pomp
of
kings,
Lords
of
the
earth!
their
luxury
and
ease.
That
is
court.
Another
view
of
man,
my
second
brings;
Behold
him
there,
the
monarch
of
the
seas!
That
is
ship;
plain
as
it
can
be.
Now
for
the
cream.
But
ah!
united,
(courtship,
you
know,)
what
reverse
we
have!
Man's
boasted
power
and
freedom,
all
are
flown.
Lord
of
the
earth
and
sea,
he
bends
a
slave,
And
woman,
lovely
woman,
reigns
alone.
A
very
proper
compliment!
and
then
follows
the
application,
which
I
think,
my
dear
Harriet,
you
cannot
find
much
difficulty
in
comprehending.
Read
it
in
comfort
to
yourself.
There
can
be
no
doubt
of
its
being
written
for
you
and
to
you."
Harriet
could
not
long
resist
so
delightful
a
persuasion.
She
read
the
concluding
lines,
and
was
all
flutter
and
happiness.
She
could
not
speak.
But
she
was
not
wanted
to
speak.
It
was
enough
for
her
to
feel.
Emma
spoke
for
her.
"There
is
so
pointed,
and
so
particular
a
meaning
in
this
compliment,"
said
she,
"that
I
cannot
have
a
doubt
as
to
Mr.
Elton's
intentions.
You
are
his
object
and
you
will
soon
receive
the
completest
proof
of
it.
I
thought
it
must
be
so.
I
thought
I
could
not
be
so
deceived;
but
now,
it
is
clear;
the
state
of
his
mind
is
as
clear
and
decided,
as
my
wishes
on
the
subject
have
been
ever
since
I
knew
you.
Yes,
Harriet,
just
so
long
have
I
been
wanting
the
very
circumstance
to
happen
that
has
happened.
I
could
never
tell
whether
an
attachment
between
you
and
Mr.
Elton
were
most
desirable
or
most
natural.
Its
probability
and
its
eligibility
have
really
so
equalled
each
other!
I
am
very
happy.
I
congratulate
you,
my
dear
Harriet,
with
all
my
heart.
This
is
an
attachment
which
a
woman
may
well
feel
pride
in
creating.
This
is
a
connexion
which
offers
nothing
but
good.
It
will
give
you
every
thing
that
you
want
consideration,
independence,
a
proper
home
it
will
fix
you
in
the
centre
of
all
your
real
friends,
close
to
Hartfield
and
to
me,
and
confirm
our
intimacy
for
ever.
This,
Harriet,
is
an
alliance
which
can
never
raise
a
blush
in
either
of
us."
"Dear
Miss
Woodhouse!"
and
"Dear
Miss
Woodhouse,"
was
all
that
Harriet,
with
many
tender
embraces
could
articulate
at
first;
but
when
they
did
arrive
at
something
more
like
conversation,
it
was
sufficiently
clear
to
her
friend
that
she
saw,
felt,
anticipated,
and
remembered
just
as
she
ought.
Mr.
Elton's
superiority
had
very
ample
acknowledgment.
"Whatever
you
say
is
always
right,"
cried
Harriet,
"and
therefore
I
suppose,
and
believe,
and
hope
it
must
be
so;
but
otherwise
I
could
not
have
imagined
it.
It
is
so
much
beyond
any
thing
I
deserve.
Mr.
Elton,
who
might
marry
any
body!
There
cannot
be
two
opinions
about
him.
He
is
so
very
superior.
Only
think
of
those
sweet
verses
'To
Miss
.'
Dear
me,
how
clever!
Could
it
really
be
meant
for
me?"
"I
cannot
make
a
question,
or
listen
to
a
question
about
that.
It
is
a
certainty.
Receive
it
on
my
judgment.
It
is
a
sort
of
prologue
to
the
play,
a
motto
to
the
chapter;
and
will
be
soon
followed
by
matter
of
fact
prose."
"It
is
a
sort
of
thing
which
nobody
could
have
expected.
I
am
sure,
a
month
ago,
I
had
no
more
idea
myself!
The
strangest
things
do
take
place!"
"When
Miss
Smiths
and
Mr.
Eltons
get
acquainted
they
do
indeed
and
really
