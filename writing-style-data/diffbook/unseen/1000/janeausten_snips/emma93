marry."
Emma
had
done.
Her
father
was
growing
nervous,
and
could
not
understand
her.
Her
mind
returned
to
Mrs.
Elton's
offences,
and
long,
very
long,
did
they
occupy
her.
Emma
was
not
required,
by
any
subsequent
discovery,
to
retract
her
ill
opinion
of
Mrs.
Elton.
Her
observation
had
been
pretty
correct.
Such
as
Mrs.
Elton
appeared
to
her
on
this
second
interview,
such
she
appeared
whenever
they
met
again,
self
important,
presuming,
familiar,
ignorant,
and
ill
bred.
She
had
a
little
beauty
and
a
little
accomplishment,
but
so
little
judgment
that
she
thought
herself
coming
with
superior
knowledge
of
the
world,
to
enliven
and
improve
a
country
neighbourhood;
and
conceived
Miss
Hawkins
to
have
held
such
a
place
in
society
as
Mrs.
Elton's
consequence
only
could
surpass.
There
was
no
reason
to
suppose
Mr.
Elton
thought
at
all
differently
from
his
wife.
He
seemed
not
merely
happy
with
her,
but
proud.
He
had
the
air
of
congratulating
himself
on
having
brought
such
a
woman
to
Highbury,
as
not
even
Miss
Woodhouse
could
equal;
and
the
greater
part
of
her
new
acquaintance,
disposed
to
commend,
or
not
in
the
habit
of
judging,
following
the
lead
of
Miss
Bates's
good
will,
or
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
bride
must
be
as
clever
and
as
agreeable
as
she
professed
herself,
were
very
well
satisfied;
so
that
Mrs.
Elton's
praise
passed
from
one
mouth
to
another
as
it
ought
to
do,
unimpeded
by
Miss
Woodhouse,
who
readily
continued
her
first
contribution
and
talked
with
a
good
grace
of
her
being
"very
pleasant
and
very
elegantly
dressed."
In
one
respect
Mrs.
Elton
grew
even
worse
than
she
had
appeared
at
first.
Her
feelings
altered
towards
Emma.
Offended,
probably,
by
the
little
encouragement
which
her
proposals
of
intimacy
met
with,
she
drew
back
in
her
turn
and
gradually
became
much
more
cold
and
distant;
and
though
the
effect
was
agreeable,
the
ill
will
which
produced
it
was
necessarily
increasing
Emma's
dislike.
Her
manners,
too
and
Mr.
Elton's,
were
unpleasant
towards
Harriet.
They
were
sneering
and
negligent.
Emma
hoped
it
must
rapidly
work
Harriet's
cure;
but
the
sensations
which
could
prompt
such
behaviour
sunk
them
both
very
much.
It
was
not
to
be
doubted
that
poor
Harriet's
attachment
had
been
an
offering
to
conjugal
unreserve,
and
her
own
share
in
the
story,
under
a
colouring
the
least
favourable
to
her
and
the
most
soothing
to
him,
had
in
all
likelihood
been
given
also.
She
was,
of
course,
the
object
of
their
joint
dislike.
When
they
had
nothing
else
to
say,
it
must
be
always
easy
to
begin
abusing
Miss
Woodhouse;
and
the
enmity
which
they
dared
not
shew
in
open
disrespect
to
her,
found
a
broader
vent
in
contemptuous
treatment
of
Harriet.
Mrs.
Elton
took
a
great
fancy
to
Jane
Fairfax;
and
from
the
first.
Not
merely
when
a
state
of
warfare
with
one
young
lady
might
be
supposed
to
recommend
the
other,
but
from
the
very
first;
and
she
was
not
satisfied
with
expressing
a
natural
and
reasonable
admiration
but
without
solicitation,
or
plea,
or
privilege,
she
must
be
wanting
to
assist
and
befriend
her.
Before
Emma
had
forfeited
her
confidence,
and
about
the
third
time
of
their
meeting,
she
heard
all
Mrs.
Elton's
knight
errantry
on
the
subject.
"Jane
Fairfax
is
absolutely
charming,
Miss
Woodhouse.
I
quite
rave
about
Jane
Fairfax.
A
sweet,
interesting
creature.
So
mild
and
ladylike
and
with
such
talents!
I
assure
you
I
think
she
has
very
extraordinary
talents.
I
do
not
scruple
to
say
that
she
plays
extremely
well.
I
know
enough
of
music
to
speak
decidedly
on
that
point.
Oh!
she
is
absolutely
charming!
You
will
laugh
at
my
warmth
but,
upon
my
word,
I
talk
of
nothing
but
Jane
Fairfax.
And
her
situation
is
so
calculated
to
affect
one!
Miss
Woodhouse,
we
must
exert
ourselves
and
endeavour
to
do
something
for
her.
We
must
bring
her
forward.
Such
talent
as
hers
must
not
be
suffered
to
remain
unknown.
I
dare
say
you
have
heard
those
charming
lines
of
the
poet,
'Full
many
a
flower
is
born
to
blush
unseen,
'And
waste
its
fragrance
on
the
desert
air.'
We
must
not
allow
them
to
be
verified
in
sweet
Jane
Fairfax."
"I
cannot
think
there
is
any
danger
of
it,"
was
Emma's
calm
answer
"and
when
you
are
better
acquainted
with
Miss
Fairfax's
situation
and
understand
what
her
home
has
been,
with
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell,
I
have
no
idea
that
you
will
suppose
her
talents
can
be
unknown."
"Oh!
but
dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
she
is
now
in
such
retirement,
such
obscurity,
so
thrown
away.
Whatever
advantages
she
may
have
enjoyed
with
the
Campbells
are
so
palpably
at
an
end!
And
I
think
she
feels
it.
I
am
sure
she
does.
She
is
very
timid
and
silent.
One
can
see
that
she
feels
the
want
of
encouragement.
I
like
her
the
better
for
it.
I
must
confess
it
is
a
recommendation
to
me.
I
am
a
great
advocate
for
timidity
and
I
am
sure
one
does
not
often
meet
with
it.
But
in
those
who
are
at
all
inferior,
it
is
extremely
prepossessing.
Oh!
I
assure
you,
Jane
Fairfax
is
a
very
delightful
character,
and
interests
me
more
than
I
can
express."
"You
appear
to
feel
a
great
deal
but
I
am
not
aware
how
you
or
any
of
Miss
Fairfax's
acquaintance
here,
any
of
those
who
have
known
her
longer
than
yourself,
can
shew
her
any
other
attention
than"
"My
dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
a
vast
deal
may
be
done
by
those
who
dare
to
act.
You
and
I
need
not
be
afraid.
If
we
set
the
example,
many
will
follow
it
as
far
as
they
can;
though
all
have
not
our
situations.
We
have
carriages
to
fetch
and
convey
her
home,
and
we
live
in
a
style
which
could
not
make
the
addition
of
Jane
Fairfax,
at
any
time,
the
least
inconvenient.
I
should
be
extremely
displeased
if
Wright
were
to
send
us
up
such
a
dinner,
as
