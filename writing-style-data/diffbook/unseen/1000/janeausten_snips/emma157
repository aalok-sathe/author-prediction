A
few
more
to
morrows,
and
the
party
from
London
would
be
arriving.
It
was
an
alarming
change;
and
Emma
was
thinking
of
it
one
morning,
as
what
must
bring
a
great
deal
to
agitate
and
grieve
her,
when
Mr.
Knightley
came
in,
and
distressing
thoughts
were
put
by.
After
the
first
chat
of
pleasure
he
was
silent;
and
then,
in
a
graver
tone,
began
with,
"I
have
something
to
tell
you,
Emma;
some
news."
"Good
or
bad?"
said
she,
quickly,
looking
up
in
his
face.
"I
do
not
know
which
it
ought
to
be
called."
"Oh!
good
I
am
sure.
I
see
it
in
your
countenance.
You
are
trying
not
to
smile."
"I
am
afraid,"
said
he,
composing
his
features,
"I
am
very
much
afraid,
my
dear
Emma,
that
you
will
not
smile
when
you
hear
it."
"Indeed!
but
why
so?
I
can
hardly
imagine
that
any
thing
which
pleases
or
amuses
you,
should
not
please
and
amuse
me
too."
"There
is
one
subject,"
he
replied,
"I
hope
but
one,
on
which
we
do
not
think
alike."
He
paused
a
moment,
again
smiling,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
face.
"Does
nothing
occur
to
you?
Do
not
you
recollect?
Harriet
Smith."
Her
cheeks
flushed
at
the
name,
and
she
felt
afraid
of
something,
though
she
knew
not
what.
"Have
you
heard
from
her
yourself
this
morning?"
cried
he.
"You
have,
I
believe,
and
know
the
whole."
"No,
I
have
not;
I
know
nothing;
pray
tell
me."
"You
are
prepared
for
the
worst,
I
see
and
very
bad
it
is.
Harriet
Smith
marries
Robert
Martin."
Emma
gave
a
start,
which
did
not
seem
like
being
prepared
and
her
eyes,
in
eager
gaze,
said,
"No,
this
is
impossible!"
but
her
lips
were
closed.
"It
is
so,
indeed,"
continued
Mr.
Knightley;
"I
have
it
from
Robert
Martin
himself.
He
left
me
not
half
an
hour
ago."
She
was
still
looking
at
him
with
the
most
speaking
amazement.
"You
like
it,
my
Emma,
as
little
as
I
feared.
I
wish
our
opinions
were
the
same.
But
in
time
they
will.
Time,
you
may
be
sure,
will
make
one
or
the
other
of
us
think
differently;
and,
in
the
meanwhile,
we
need
not
talk
much
on
the
subject."
"You
mistake
me,
you
quite
mistake
me,"
she
replied,
exerting
herself.
"It
is
not
that
such
a
circumstance
would
now
make
me
unhappy,
but
I
cannot
believe
it.
It
seems
an
impossibility!
You
cannot
mean
to
say,
that
Harriet
Smith
has
accepted
Robert
Martin.
You
cannot
mean
that
he
has
even
proposed
to
her
again
yet.
You
only
mean,
that
he
intends
it."
"I
mean
that
he
has
done
it,"
answered
Mr.
Knightley,
with
smiling
but
determined
decision,
"and
been
accepted."
"Good
God!"
she
cried.
"Well!"
Then
having
recourse
to
her
workbasket,
in
excuse
for
leaning
down
her
face,
and
concealing
all
the
exquisite
feelings
of
delight
and
entertainment
which
she
knew
she
must
be
expressing,
she
added,
"Well,
now
tell
me
every
thing;
make
this
intelligible
to
me.
How,
where,
when?
Let
me
know
it
all.
I
never
was
more
surprized
but
it
does
not
make
me
unhappy,
I
assure
you.
How
how
has
it
been
possible?"
"It
is
a
very
simple
story.
He
went
to
town
on
business
three
days
ago,
and
I
got
him
to
take
charge
of
some
papers
which
I
was
wanting
to
send
to
John.
He
delivered
these
papers
to
John,
at
his
chambers,
and
was
asked
by
him
to
join
their
party
the
same
evening
to
Astley's.
They
were
going
to
take
the
two
eldest
boys
to
Astley's.
The
party
was
to
be
our
brother
and
sister,
Henry,
John
and
Miss
Smith.
My
friend
Robert
could
not
resist.
They
called
for
him
in
their
way;
were
all
extremely
amused;
and
my
brother
asked
him
to
dine
with
them
the
next
day
which
he
did
and
in
the
course
of
that
visit
(as
I
understand)
he
found
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
Harriet;
and
certainly
did
not
speak
in
vain.
She
made
him,
by
her
acceptance,
as
happy
even
as
he
is
deserving.
He
came
down
by
yesterday's
coach,
and
was
with
me
this
morning
immediately
after
breakfast,
to
report
his
proceedings,
first
on
my
affairs,
and
then
on
his
own.
This
is
all
that
I
can
relate
of
the
how,
where,
and
when.
Your
friend
Harriet
will
make
a
much
longer
history
when
you
see
her.
She
will
give
you
all
the
minute
particulars,
which
only
woman's
language
can
make
interesting.
In
our
communications
we
deal
only
in
the
great.
However,
I
must
say,
that
Robert
Martin's
heart
seemed
for
him,
and
to
me,
very
overflowing;
and
that
he
did
mention,
without
its
being
much
to
the
purpose,
that
on
quitting
their
box
at
Astley's,
my
brother
took
charge
of
Mrs.
John
Knightley
and
little
John,
and
he
followed
with
Miss
Smith
and
Henry;
and
that
at
one
time
they
were
in
such
a
crowd,
as
to
make
Miss
Smith
rather
uneasy."
He
stopped.
Emma
dared
not
attempt
any
immediate
reply.
To
speak,
she
was
sure
would
be
to
betray
a
most
unreasonable
degree
of
happiness.
She
must
wait
a
moment,
or
he
would
think
her
mad.
Her
silence
disturbed
him;
and
after
observing
her
a
little
while,
he
added,
"Emma,
my
love,
you
said
that
this
circumstance
would
not
now
make
you
unhappy;
but
I
am
afraid
it
gives
you
more
pain
than
you
expected.
His
situation
is
an
evil
but
you
must
consider
it
as
what
satisfies
your
friend;
and
I
will
answer
for
your
thinking
better
and
better
of
him
as
you
know
him
more.
His
good
sense
and
good
principles
would
delight
you.
As
far
as
the
man
is
concerned,
you
could
not
wish
your
friend
in
better
hands.
His
rank
in
society
I
would
alter
if
I
could,
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
I
assure
you,
Emma.
You
laugh
at
me
about
William
Larkins;
but
I
could
quite
as
ill
spare
Robert
Martin."
