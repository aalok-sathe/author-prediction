to
and
fro,
between
the
different
rooms,
some
suggesting,
some
attending,
and
all
in
happy
enjoyment
of
the
future.
The
party
did
not
break
up
without
Emma's
being
positively
secured
for
the
two
first
dances
by
the
hero
of
the
evening,
nor
without
her
overhearing
Mr.
Weston
whisper
to
his
wife,
"He
has
asked
her,
my
dear.
That's
right.
I
knew
he
would!"
One
thing
only
was
wanting
to
make
the
prospect
of
the
ball
completely
satisfactory
to
Emma
its
being
fixed
for
a
day
within
the
granted
term
of
Frank
Churchill's
stay
in
Surry;
for,
in
spite
of
Mr.
Weston's
confidence,
she
could
not
think
it
so
very
impossible
that
the
Churchills
might
not
allow
their
nephew
to
remain
a
day
beyond
his
fortnight.
But
this
was
not
judged
feasible.
The
preparations
must
take
their
time,
nothing
could
be
properly
ready
till
the
third
week
were
entered
on,
and
for
a
few
days
they
must
be
planning,
proceeding
and
hoping
in
uncertainty
at
the
risk
in
her
opinion,
the
great
risk,
of
its
being
all
in
vain.
Enscombe
however
was
gracious,
gracious
in
fact,
if
not
in
word.
His
wish
of
staying
longer
evidently
did
not
please;
but
it
was
not
opposed.
All
was
safe
and
prosperous;
and
as
the
removal
of
one
solicitude
generally
makes
way
for
another,
Emma,
being
now
certain
of
her
ball,
began
to
adopt
as
the
next
vexation
Mr.
Knightley's
provoking
indifference
about
it.
Either
because
he
did
not
dance
himself,
or
because
the
plan
had
been
formed
without
his
being
consulted,
he
seemed
resolved
that
it
should
not
interest
him,
determined
against
its
exciting
any
present
curiosity,
or
affording
him
any
future
amusement.
To
her
voluntary
communications
Emma
could
get
no
more
approving
reply,
than,
"Very
well.
If
the
Westons
think
it
worth
while
to
be
at
all
this
trouble
for
a
few
hours
of
noisy
entertainment,
I
have
nothing
to
say
against
it,
but
that
they
shall
not
chuse
pleasures
for
me.
Oh!
yes,
I
must
be
there;
I
could
not
refuse;
and
I
will
keep
as
much
awake
as
I
can;
but
I
would
rather
be
at
home,
looking
over
William
Larkins's
week's
account;
much
rather,
I
confess.
Pleasure
in
seeing
dancing!
not
I,
indeed
I
never
look
at
it
I
do
not
know
who
does.
Fine
dancing,
I
believe,
like
virtue,
must
be
its
own
reward.
Those
who
are
standing
by
are
usually
thinking
of
something
very
different."
This
Emma
felt
was
aimed
at
her;
and
it
made
her
quite
angry.
It
was
not
in
compliment
to
Jane
Fairfax
however
that
he
was
so
indifferent,
or
so
indignant;
he
was
not
guided
by
her
feelings
in
reprobating
the
ball,
for
she
enjoyed
the
thought
of
it
to
an
extraordinary
degree.
It
made
her
animated
open
hearted
she
voluntarily
said;
"Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
I
hope
nothing
may
happen
to
prevent
the
ball.
What
a
disappointment
it
would
be!
I
do
look
forward
to
it,
I
own,
with
very
great
pleasure."
It
was
not
to
oblige
Jane
Fairfax
therefore
that
he
would
have
preferred
the
society
of
William
Larkins.
No!
she
was
more
and
more
convinced
that
Mrs.
Weston
was
quite
mistaken
in
that
surmise.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
friendly
and
of
compassionate
attachment
on
his
side
but
no
love.
Alas!
there
was
soon
no
leisure
for
quarrelling
with
Mr.
Knightley.
Two
days
of
joyful
security
were
immediately
followed
by
the
over
throw
of
every
thing.
A
letter
arrived
from
Mr.
Churchill
to
urge
his
nephew's
instant
return.
Mrs.
Churchill
was
unwell
far
too
unwell
to
do
without
him;
she
had
been
in
a
very
suffering
state
(so
said
her
husband)
when
writing
to
her
nephew
two
days
before,
though
from
her
usual
unwillingness
to
give
pain,
and
constant
habit
of
never
thinking
of
herself,
she
had
not
mentioned
it;
but
now
she
was
too
ill
to
trifle,
and
must
entreat
him
to
set
off
for
Enscombe
without
delay.
The
substance
of
this
letter
was
forwarded
to
Emma,
in
a
note
from
Mrs.
Weston,
instantly.
As
to
his
going,
it
was
inevitable.
He
must
be
gone
within
a
few
hours,
though
without
feeling
any
real
alarm
for
his
aunt,
to
lessen
his
repugnance.
He
knew
her
illnesses;
they
never
occurred
but
for
her
own
convenience.
Mrs.
Weston
added,
"that
he
could
only
allow
himself
time
to
hurry
to
Highbury,
after
breakfast,
and
take
leave
of
the
few
friends
there
whom
he
could
suppose
to
feel
any
interest
in
him;
and
that
he
might
be
expected
at
Hartfield
very
soon."
This
wretched
note
was
the
finale
of
Emma's
breakfast.
When
once
it
had
been
read,
there
was
no
doing
any
thing,
but
lament
and
exclaim.
The
loss
of
the
ball
the
loss
of
the
young
man
and
all
that
the
young
man
might
be
feeling!
It
was
too
wretched!
Such
a
delightful
evening
as
it
would
have
been!
Every
body
so
happy!
and
she
and
her
partner
the
happiest!
"I
said
it
would
be
so,"
was
the
only
consolation.
Her
father's
feelings
were
quite
distinct.
He
thought
principally
of
Mrs.
Churchill's
illness,
and
wanted
to
know
how
she
was
treated;
and
as
for
the
ball,
it
was
shocking
to
have
dear
Emma
disappointed;
but
they
would
all
be
safer
at
home.
Emma
was
ready
for
her
visitor
some
time
before
he
appeared;
but
if
this
reflected
at
all
upon
his
impatience,
his
sorrowful
look
and
total
want
of
spirits
when
he
did
come
might
redeem
him.
He
felt
the
going
away
almost
too
much
to
speak
of
it.
His
dejection
was
most
evident.
He
sat
really
lost
in
thought
for
the
first
few
minutes;
and
when
rousing
himself,
it
was
only
to
say,
"Of
all
horrid
things,
leave
taking
is
the
worst."
"But
you
will
come
again,"
said
Emma.
"This
will
not
be
your
only
visit
to
Randalls."
"Ah!
(shaking
his
head)
the
uncertainty
of
when
I
may
be
able
to
return!
I
shall
try
for
it
with
a
zeal!
It
