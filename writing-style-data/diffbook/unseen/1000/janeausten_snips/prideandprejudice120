distracted."
This
was
enough
to
prove
that
her
approbation
need
not
be
doubted:
and
Elizabeth,
rejoicing
that
such
an
effusion
was
heard
only
by
herself,
soon
went
away.
But
before
she
had
been
three
minutes
in
her
own
room,
her
mother
followed
her.
"My
dearest
child,"
she
cried,
"I
can
think
of
nothing
else!
Ten
thousand
a
year,
and
very
likely
more!
'Tis
as
good
as
a
Lord!
And
a
special
licence.
You
must
and
shall
be
married
by
a
special
licence.
But
my
dearest
love,
tell
me
what
dish
Mr.
Darcy
is
particularly
fond
of,
that
I
may
have
it
to
morrow."
This
was
a
sad
omen
of
what
her
mother's
behaviour
to
the
gentleman
himself
might
be;
and
Elizabeth
found
that,
though
in
the
certain
possession
of
his
warmest
affection,
and
secure
of
her
relations'
consent,
there
was
still
something
to
be
wished
for.
But
the
morrow
passed
off
much
better
than
she
expected;
for
Mrs.
Bennet
luckily
stood
in
such
awe
of
her
intended
son
in
law
that
she
ventured
not
to
speak
to
him,
unless
it
was
in
her
power
to
offer
him
any
attention,
or
mark
her
deference
for
his
opinion.
Elizabeth
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
father
taking
pains
to
get
acquainted
with
him;
and
Mr.
Bennet
soon
assured
her
that
he
was
rising
every
hour
in
his
esteem.
"I
admire
all
my
three
sons
in
law
highly,"
said
he.
"Wickham,
perhaps,
is
my
favourite;
but
I
think
I
shall
like
your
husband
quite
as
well
as
Jane's."
Elizabeth's
spirits
soon
rising
to
playfulness
again,
she
wanted
Mr.
Darcy
to
account
for
his
having
ever
fallen
in
love
with
her.
"How
could
you
begin?"
said
she.
"I
can
comprehend
your
going
on
charmingly,
when
you
had
once
made
a
beginning;
but
what
could
set
you
off
in
the
first
place?"
"I
cannot
fix
on
the
hour,
or
the
spot,
or
the
look,
or
the
words,
which
laid
the
foundation.
It
is
too
long
ago.
I
was
in
the
middle
before
I
knew
that
I
had
begun."
"My
beauty
you
had
early
withstood,
and
as
for
my
manners
my
behaviour
to
you
was
at
least
always
bordering
on
the
uncivil,
and
I
never
spoke
to
you
without
rather
wishing
to
give
you
pain
than
not.
Now
be
sincere;
did
you
admire
me
for
my
impertinence?"
"For
the
liveliness
of
your
mind,
I
did."
"You
may
as
well
call
it
impertinence
at
once.
It
was
very
little
less.
The
fact
is,
that
you
were
sick
of
civility,
of
deference,
of
officious
attention.
You
were
disgusted
with
the
women
who
were
always
speaking,
and
looking,
and
thinking
for
your
approbation
alone.
I
roused,
and
interested
you,
because
I
was
so
unlike
them.
Had
you
not
been
really
amiable,
you
would
have
hated
me
for
it;
but
in
spite
of
the
pains
you
took
to
disguise
yourself,
your
feelings
were
always
noble
and
just;
and
in
your
heart,
you
thoroughly
despised
the
persons
who
so
assiduously
courted
you.
There
I
have
saved
you
the
trouble
of
accounting
for
it;
and
really,
all
things
considered,
I
begin
to
think
it
perfectly
reasonable.
To
be
sure,
you
knew
no
actual
good
of
me
but
nobody
thinks
of
that
when
they
fall
in
love."
"Was
there
no
good
in
your
affectionate
behaviour
to
Jane
while
she
was
ill
at
Netherfield?"
"Dearest
Jane!
who
could
have
done
less
for
her?
But
make
a
virtue
of
it
by
all
means.
My
good
qualities
are
under
your
protection,
and
you
are
to
exaggerate
them
as
much
as
possible;
and,
in
return,
it
belongs
to
me
to
find
occasions
for
teasing
and
quarrelling
with
you
as
often
as
may
be;
and
I
shall
begin
directly
by
asking
you
what
made
you
so
unwilling
to
come
to
the
point
at
last.
What
made
you
so
shy
of
me,
when
you
first
called,
and
afterwards
dined
here?
Why,
especially,
when
you
called,
did
you
look
as
if
you
did
not
care
about
me?"
"Because
you
were
grave
and
silent,
and
gave
me
no
encouragement."
"But
I
was
embarrassed."
"And
so
was
I."
"You
might
have
talked
to
me
more
when
you
came
to
dinner."
"A
man
who
had
felt
less,
might."
"How
unlucky
that
you
should
have
a
reasonable
answer
to
give,
and
that
I
should
be
so
reasonable
as
to
admit
it!
But
I
wonder
how
long
you
would
have
gone
on,
if
you
had
been
left
to
yourself.
I
wonder
when
you
would
have
spoken,
if
I
had
not
asked
you!
My
resolution
of
thanking
you
for
your
kindness
to
Lydia
had
certainly
great
effect.
Too
much,
I
am
afraid;
for
what
becomes
of
the
moral,
if
our
comfort
springs
from
a
breach
of
promise?
for
I
ought
not
to
have
mentioned
the
subject.
This
will
never
do."
"You
need
not
distress
yourself.
The
moral
will
be
perfectly
fair.
Lady
Catherine's
unjustifiable
endeavours
to
separate
us
were
the
means
of
removing
all
my
doubts.
I
am
not
indebted
for
my
present
happiness
to
your
eager
desire
of
expressing
your
gratitude.
I
was
not
in
a
humour
to
wait
for
any
opening
of
yours.
My
aunt's
intelligence
had
given
me
hope,
and
I
was
determined
at
once
to
know
every
thing."
"Lady
Catherine
has
been
of
infinite
use,
which
ought
to
make
her
happy,
for
she
loves
to
be
of
use.
But
tell
me,
what
did
you
come
down
to
Netherfield
for?
Was
it
merely
to
ride
to
Longbourn
and
be
embarrassed?
or
had
you
intended
any
more
serious
consequence?"
"My
real
purpose
was
to
see
you,
and
to
judge,
if
I
could,
whether
I
might
ever
hope
to
make
you
love
me.
My
avowed
one,
or
what
I
avowed
to
myself,
was
to
see
whether
your
sister
were
still
partial
to
Bingley,
and
if
she
were,
to
make
the
confession
to
him
which
I
have
since
made."
"Shall
you
ever
have
courage
to
announce
to
Lady
Catherine
what
is
to
befall
her?"
"I
am
