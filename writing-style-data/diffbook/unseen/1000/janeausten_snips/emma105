were
under
continual
irritation
and
suffering;
and
by
the
ten
days'
end,
her
nephew's
letter
to
Randalls
communicated
a
change
of
plan.
They
were
going
to
remove
immediately
to
Richmond.
Mrs.
Churchill
had
been
recommended
to
the
medical
skill
of
an
eminent
person
there,
and
had
otherwise
a
fancy
for
the
place.
A
ready
furnished
house
in
a
favourite
spot
was
engaged,
and
much
benefit
expected
from
the
change.
Emma
heard
that
Frank
wrote
in
the
highest
spirits
of
this
arrangement,
and
seemed
most
fully
to
appreciate
the
blessing
of
having
two
months
before
him
of
such
near
neighbourhood
to
many
dear
friends
for
the
house
was
taken
for
May
and
June.
She
was
told
that
now
he
wrote
with
the
greatest
confidence
of
being
often
with
them,
almost
as
often
as
he
could
even
wish.
Emma
saw
how
Mr.
Weston
understood
these
joyous
prospects.
He
was
considering
her
as
the
source
of
all
the
happiness
they
offered.
She
hoped
it
was
not
so.
Two
months
must
bring
it
to
the
proof.
Mr.
Weston's
own
happiness
was
indisputable.
He
was
quite
delighted.
It
was
the
very
circumstance
he
could
have
wished
for.
Now,
it
would
be
really
having
Frank
in
their
neighbourhood.
What
were
nine
miles
to
a
young
man?
An
hour's
ride.
He
would
be
always
coming
over.
The
difference
in
that
respect
of
Richmond
and
London
was
enough
to
make
the
whole
difference
of
seeing
him
always
and
seeing
him
never.
Sixteen
miles
nay,
eighteen
it
must
be
full
eighteen
to
Manchester
street
was
a
serious
obstacle.
Were
he
ever
able
to
get
away,
the
day
would
be
spent
in
coming
and
returning.
There
was
no
comfort
in
having
him
in
London;
he
might
as
well
be
at
Enscombe;
but
Richmond
was
the
very
distance
for
easy
intercourse.
Better
than
nearer!
One
good
thing
was
immediately
brought
to
a
certainty
by
this
removal,
the
ball
at
the
Crown.
It
had
not
been
forgotten
before,
but
it
had
been
soon
acknowledged
vain
to
attempt
to
fix
a
day.
Now,
however,
it
was
absolutely
to
be;
every
preparation
was
resumed,
and
very
soon
after
the
Churchills
had
removed
to
Richmond,
a
few
lines
from
Frank,
to
say
that
his
aunt
felt
already
much
better
for
the
change,
and
that
he
had
no
doubt
of
being
able
to
join
them
for
twenty
four
hours
at
any
given
time,
induced
them
to
name
as
early
a
day
as
possible.
Mr.
Weston's
ball
was
to
be
a
real
thing.
A
very
few
to
morrows
stood
between
the
young
people
of
Highbury
and
happiness.
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
resigned.
The
time
of
year
lightened
the
evil
to
him.
May
was
better
for
every
thing
than
February.
Mrs.
Bates
was
engaged
to
spend
the
evening
at
Hartfield,
James
had
due
notice,
and
he
sanguinely
hoped
that
neither
dear
little
Henry
nor
dear
little
John
would
have
any
thing
the
matter
with
them,
while
dear
Emma
were
gone.
No
misfortune
occurred,
again
to
prevent
the
ball.
The
day
approached,
the
day
arrived;
and
after
a
morning
of
some
anxious
watching,
Frank
Churchill,
in
all
the
certainty
of
his
own
self,
reached
Randalls
before
dinner,
and
every
thing
was
safe.
No
second
meeting
had
there
yet
been
between
him
and
Emma.
The
room
at
the
Crown
was
to
witness
it;
but
it
would
be
better
than
a
common
meeting
in
a
crowd.
Mr.
Weston
had
been
so
very
earnest
in
his
entreaties
for
her
arriving
there
as
soon
as
possible
after
themselves,
for
the
purpose
of
taking
her
opinion
as
to
the
propriety
and
comfort
of
the
rooms
before
any
other
persons
came,
that
she
could
not
refuse
him,
and
must
therefore
spend
some
quiet
interval
in
the
young
man's
company.
She
was
to
convey
Harriet,
and
they
drove
to
the
Crown
in
good
time,
the
Randalls
party
just
sufficiently
before
them.
Frank
Churchill
seemed
to
have
been
on
the
watch;
and
though
he
did
not
say
much,
his
eyes
declared
that
he
meant
to
have
a
delightful
evening.
They
all
walked
about
together,
to
see
that
every
thing
was
as
it
should
be;
and
within
a
few
minutes
were
joined
by
the
contents
of
another
carriage,
which
Emma
could
not
hear
the
sound
of
at
first,
without
great
surprize.
"So
unreasonably
early!"
she
was
going
to
exclaim;
but
she
presently
found
that
it
was
a
family
of
old
friends,
who
were
coming,
like
herself,
by
particular
desire,
to
help
Mr.
Weston's
judgment;
and
they
were
so
very
closely
followed
by
another
carriage
of
cousins,
who
had
been
entreated
to
come
early
with
the
same
distinguishing
earnestness,
on
the
same
errand,
that
it
seemed
as
if
half
the
company
might
soon
be
collected
together
for
the
purpose
of
preparatory
inspection.
Emma
perceived
that
her
taste
was
not
the
only
taste
on
which
Mr.
Weston
depended,
and
felt,
that
to
be
the
favourite
and
intimate
of
a
man
who
had
so
many
intimates
and
confidantes,
was
not
the
very
first
distinction
in
the
scale
of
vanity.
She
liked
his
open
manners,
but
a
little
less
of
open
heartedness
would
have
made
him
a
higher
character.
General
benevolence,
but
not
general
friendship,
made
a
man
what
he
ought
to
be.
She
could
fancy
such
a
man.
The
whole
party
walked
about,
and
looked,
and
praised
again;
and
then,
having
nothing
else
to
do,
formed
a
sort
of
half
circle
round
the
fire,
to
observe
in
their
various
modes,
till
other
subjects
were
started,
that,
though
May,
a
fire
in
the
evening
was
still
very
pleasant.
Emma
found
that
it
was
not
Mr.
Weston's
fault
that
the
number
of
privy
councillors
was
not
yet
larger.
They
had
stopped
at
Mrs.
Bates's
door
to
offer
the
use
of
their
carriage,
but
the
aunt
and
niece
were
to
be
brought
by
the
Eltons.
Frank
was
standing
by
her,
but
not
steadily;
there
was
a
restlessness,
which
shewed
a
mind
not
at
ease.
He
was
looking
about,
he
was
going
to
the
door,
he
