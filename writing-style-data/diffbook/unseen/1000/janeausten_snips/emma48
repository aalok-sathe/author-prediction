as
warmly
into
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston's
disappointment,
as
might
naturally
belong
to
their
friendship.
She
was
the
first
to
announce
it
to
Mr.
Knightley;
and
exclaimed
quite
as
much
as
was
necessary,
(or,
being
acting
a
part,
perhaps
rather
more,)
at
the
conduct
of
the
Churchills,
in
keeping
him
away.
She
then
proceeded
to
say
a
good
deal
more
than
she
felt,
of
the
advantage
of
such
an
addition
to
their
confined
society
in
Surry;
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
somebody
new;
the
gala
day
to
Highbury
entire,
which
the
sight
of
him
would
have
made;
and
ending
with
reflections
on
the
Churchills
again,
found
herself
directly
involved
in
a
disagreement
with
Mr.
Knightley;
and,
to
her
great
amusement,
perceived
that
she
was
taking
the
other
side
of
the
question
from
her
real
opinion,
and
making
use
of
Mrs.
Weston's
arguments
against
herself.
"The
Churchills
are
very
likely
in
fault,"
said
Mr.
Knightley,
coolly;
"but
I
dare
say
he
might
come
if
he
would."
"I
do
not
know
why
you
should
say
so.
He
wishes
exceedingly
to
come;
but
his
uncle
and
aunt
will
not
spare
him."
"I
cannot
believe
that
he
has
not
the
power
of
coming,
if
he
made
a
point
of
it.
It
is
too
unlikely,
for
me
to
believe
it
without
proof."
"How
odd
you
are!
What
has
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
done,
to
make
you
suppose
him
such
an
unnatural
creature?"
"I
am
not
supposing
him
at
all
an
unnatural
creature,
in
suspecting
that
he
may
have
learnt
to
be
above
his
connexions,
and
to
care
very
little
for
any
thing
but
his
own
pleasure,
from
living
with
those
who
have
always
set
him
the
example
of
it.
It
is
a
great
deal
more
natural
than
one
could
wish,
that
a
young
man,
brought
up
by
those
who
are
proud,
luxurious,
and
selfish,
should
be
proud,
luxurious,
and
selfish
too.
If
Frank
Churchill
had
wanted
to
see
his
father,
he
would
have
contrived
it
between
September
and
January.
A
man
at
his
age
what
is
he?
three
or
four
and
twenty
cannot
be
without
the
means
of
doing
as
much
as
that.
It
is
impossible."
"That's
easily
said,
and
easily
felt
by
you,
who
have
always
been
your
own
master.
You
are
the
worst
judge
in
the
world,
Mr.
Knightley,
of
the
difficulties
of
dependence.
You
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
have
tempers
to
manage."
"It
is
not
to
be
conceived
that
a
man
of
three
or
four
and
twenty
should
not
have
liberty
of
mind
or
limb
to
that
amount.
He
cannot
want
money
he
cannot
want
leisure.
We
know,
on
the
contrary,
that
he
has
so
much
of
both,
that
he
is
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
at
the
idlest
haunts
in
the
kingdom.
We
hear
of
him
for
ever
at
some
watering
place
or
other.
A
little
while
ago,
he
was
at
Weymouth.
This
proves
that
he
can
leave
the
Churchills."
"Yes,
sometimes
he
can."
"And
those
times
are
whenever
he
thinks
it
worth
his
while;
whenever
there
is
any
temptation
of
pleasure."
"It
is
very
unfair
to
judge
of
any
body's
conduct,
without
an
intimate
knowledge
of
their
situation.
Nobody,
who
has
not
been
in
the
interior
of
a
family,
can
say
what
the
difficulties
of
any
individual
of
that
family
may
be.
We
ought
to
be
acquainted
with
Enscombe,
and
with
Mrs.
Churchill's
temper,
before
we
pretend
to
decide
upon
what
her
nephew
can
do.
He
may,
at
times,
be
able
to
do
a
great
deal
more
than
he
can
at
others."
"There
is
one
thing,
Emma,
which
a
man
can
always
do,
if
he
chuses,
and
that
is,
his
duty;
not
by
manoeuvring
and
finessing,
but
by
vigour
and
resolution.
It
is
Frank
Churchill's
duty
to
pay
this
attention
to
his
father.
He
knows
it
to
be
so,
by
his
promises
and
messages;
but
if
he
wished
to
do
it,
it
might
be
done.
A
man
who
felt
rightly
would
say
at
once,
simply
and
resolutely,
to
Mrs.
Churchill
'Every
sacrifice
of
mere
pleasure
you
will
always
find
me
ready
to
make
to
your
convenience;
but
I
must
go
and
see
my
father
immediately.
I
know
he
would
be
hurt
by
my
failing
in
such
a
mark
of
respect
to
him
on
the
present
occasion.
I
shall,
therefore,
set
off
to
morrow.'
If
he
would
say
so
to
her
at
once,
in
the
tone
of
decision
becoming
a
man,
there
would
be
no
opposition
made
to
his
going."
"No,"
said
Emma,
laughing;
"but
perhaps
there
might
be
some
made
to
his
coming
back
again.
Such
language
for
a
young
man
entirely
dependent,
to
use!
Nobody
but
you,
Mr.
Knightley,
would
imagine
it
possible.
But
you
have
not
an
idea
of
what
is
requisite
in
situations
directly
opposite
to
your
own.
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
to
be
making
such
a
speech
as
that
to
the
uncle
and
aunt,
who
have
brought
him
up,
and
are
to
provide
for
him!
Standing
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room,
I
suppose,
and
speaking
as
loud
as
he
could!
How
can
you
imagine
such
conduct
practicable?"
"Depend
upon
it,
Emma,
a
sensible
man
would
find
no
difficulty
in
it.
He
would
feel
himself
in
the
right;
and
the
declaration
made,
of
course,
as
a
man
of
sense
would
make
it,
in
a
proper
manner
would
do
him
more
good,
raise
him
higher,
fix
his
interest
stronger
with
the
people
he
depended
on,
than
all
that
a
line
of
shifts
and
expedients
can
ever
do.
Respect
would
be
added
to
affection.
They
would
feel
that
they
could
trust
him;
that
the
nephew
who
had
done
rightly
by
his
father,
would
do
rightly
by
them;
for
they
know,
as
well
as
he
does,
as
well
as
all
the
world
must
know,
that
he
ought
to
pay
this
visit
to
his
father;
and
while
meanly
exerting
their
power
to
delay
it,
are
in
their
hearts
not
thinking
the
better
of
him
for
submitting
to
