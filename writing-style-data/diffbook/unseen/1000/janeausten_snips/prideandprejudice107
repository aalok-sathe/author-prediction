walked
out
to
recover
her
spirits;
or
in
other
words,
to
dwell
without
interruption
on
those
subjects
that
must
deaden
them
more.
Mr.
Darcy's
behaviour
astonished
and
vexed
her.
"Why,
if
he
came
only
to
be
silent,
grave,
and
indifferent,"
said
she,
"did
he
come
at
all?"
She
could
settle
it
in
no
way
that
gave
her
pleasure.
"He
could
be
still
amiable,
still
pleasing,
to
my
uncle
and
aunt,
when
he
was
in
town;
and
why
not
to
me?
If
he
fears
me,
why
come
hither?
If
he
no
longer
cares
for
me,
why
silent?
Teasing,
teasing,
man!
I
will
think
no
more
about
him."
Her
resolution
was
for
a
short
time
involuntarily
kept
by
the
approach
of
her
sister,
who
joined
her
with
a
cheerful
look,
which
showed
her
better
satisfied
with
their
visitors,
than
Elizabeth.
"Now,"
said
she,
"that
this
first
meeting
is
over,
I
feel
perfectly
easy.
I
know
my
own
strength,
and
I
shall
never
be
embarrassed
again
by
his
coming.
I
am
glad
he
dines
here
on
Tuesday.
It
will
then
be
publicly
seen
that,
on
both
sides,
we
meet
only
as
common
and
indifferent
acquaintance."
"Yes,
very
indifferent
indeed,"
said
Elizabeth,
laughingly.
"Oh,
Jane,
take
care."
"My
dear
Lizzy,
you
cannot
think
me
so
weak,
as
to
be
in
danger
now?"
"I
think
you
are
in
very
great
danger
of
making
him
as
much
in
love
with
you
as
ever."
They
did
not
see
the
gentlemen
again
till
Tuesday;
and
Mrs.
Bennet,
in
the
meanwhile,
was
giving
way
to
all
the
happy
schemes,
which
the
good
humour
and
common
politeness
of
Bingley,
in
half
an
hour's
visit,
had
revived.
On
Tuesday
there
was
a
large
party
assembled
at
Longbourn;
and
the
two
who
were
most
anxiously
expected,
to
the
credit
of
their
punctuality
as
sportsmen,
were
in
very
good
time.
When
they
repaired
to
the
dining
room,
Elizabeth
eagerly
watched
to
see
whether
Bingley
would
take
the
place,
which,
in
all
their
former
parties,
had
belonged
to
him,
by
her
sister.
Her
prudent
mother,
occupied
by
the
same
ideas,
forbore
to
invite
him
to
sit
by
herself.
On
entering
the
room,
he
seemed
to
hesitate;
but
Jane
happened
to
look
round,
and
happened
to
smile:
it
was
decided.
He
placed
himself
by
her.
Elizabeth,
with
a
triumphant
sensation,
looked
towards
his
friend.
He
bore
it
with
noble
indifference,
and
she
would
have
imagined
that
Bingley
had
received
his
sanction
to
be
happy,
had
she
not
seen
his
eyes
likewise
turned
towards
Mr.
Darcy,
with
an
expression
of
half
laughing
alarm.
His
behaviour
to
her
sister
was
such,
during
dinner
time,
as
showed
an
admiration
of
her,
which,
though
more
guarded
than
formerly,
persuaded
Elizabeth,
that
if
left
wholly
to
himself,
Jane's
happiness,
and
his
own,
would
be
speedily
secured.
Though
she
dared
not
depend
upon
the
consequence,
she
yet
received
pleasure
from
observing
his
behaviour.
It
gave
her
all
the
animation
that
her
spirits
could
boast;
for
she
was
in
no
cheerful
humour.
Mr.
Darcy
was
almost
as
far
from
her
as
the
table
could
divide
them.
He
was
on
one
side
of
her
mother.
She
knew
how
little
such
a
situation
would
give
pleasure
to
either,
or
make
either
appear
to
advantage.
She
was
not
near
enough
to
hear
any
of
their
discourse,
but
she
could
see
how
seldom
they
spoke
to
each
other,
and
how
formal
and
cold
was
their
manner
whenever
they
did.
Her
mother's
ungraciousness,
made
the
sense
of
what
they
owed
him
more
painful
to
Elizabeth's
mind;
and
she
would,
at
times,
have
given
anything
to
be
privileged
to
tell
him
that
his
kindness
was
neither
unknown
nor
unfelt
by
the
whole
of
the
family.
She
was
in
hopes
that
the
evening
would
afford
some
opportunity
of
bringing
them
together;
that
the
whole
of
the
visit
would
not
pass
away
without
enabling
them
to
enter
into
something
more
of
conversation
than
the
mere
ceremonious
salutation
attending
his
entrance.
Anxious
and
uneasy,
the
period
which
passed
in
the
drawing
room,
before
the
gentlemen
came,
was
wearisome
and
dull
to
a
degree
that
almost
made
her
uncivil.
She
looked
forward
to
their
entrance
as
the
point
on
which
all
her
chance
of
pleasure
for
the
evening
must
depend.
"If
he
does
not
come
to
me,
then,"
said
she,
"I
shall
give
him
up
for
ever."
The
gentlemen
came;
and
she
thought
he
looked
as
if
he
would
have
answered
her
hopes;
but,
alas!
the
ladies
had
crowded
round
the
table,
where
Miss
Bennet
was
making
tea,
and
Elizabeth
pouring
out
the
coffee,
in
so
close
a
confederacy
that
there
was
not
a
single
vacancy
near
her
which
would
admit
of
a
chair.
And
on
the
gentlemen's
approaching,
one
of
the
girls
moved
closer
to
her
than
ever,
and
said,
in
a
whisper:
"The
men
shan't
come
and
part
us,
I
am
determined.
We
want
none
of
them;
do
we?"
Darcy
had
walked
away
to
another
part
of
the
room.
She
followed
him
with
her
eyes,
envied
everyone
to
whom
he
spoke,
had
scarcely
patience
enough
to
help
anybody
to
coffee;
and
then
was
enraged
against
herself
for
being
so
silly!
"A
man
who
has
once
been
refused!
How
could
I
ever
be
foolish
enough
to
expect
a
renewal
of
his
love?
Is
there
one
among
the
sex,
who
would
not
protest
against
such
a
weakness
as
a
second
proposal
to
the
same
woman?
There
is
no
indignity
so
abhorrent
to
their
feelings!"
She
was
a
little
revived,
however,
by
his
bringing
back
his
coffee
cup
himself;
and
she
seized
the
opportunity
of
saying:
"Is
your
sister
at
Pemberley
still?"
"Yes,
she
will
remain
there
till
Christmas."
"And
quite
alone?
Have
all
her
friends
left
her?"
"Mrs.
Annesley
is
with
her.
The
others
have
been
gone
on
to
Scarborough,
these
three
weeks."
She
could
think
of
nothing
more
to
say;
but
if
he
wished
to
converse
with
her,
he
might
have
better
success.
He
stood
by
her,
however,
for
some
minutes,
