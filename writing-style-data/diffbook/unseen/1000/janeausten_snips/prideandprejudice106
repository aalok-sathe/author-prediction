distressed
to
a
most
painful
degree
by
a
distinction
so
ill
applied.
Darcy,
after
inquiring
of
her
how
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
did,
a
question
which
she
could
not
answer
without
confusion,
said
scarcely
anything.
He
was
not
seated
by
her;
perhaps
that
was
the
reason
of
his
silence;
but
it
had
not
been
so
in
Derbyshire.
There
he
had
talked
to
her
friends,
when
he
could
not
to
herself.
But
now
several
minutes
elapsed
without
bringing
the
sound
of
his
voice;
and
when
occasionally,
unable
to
resist
the
impulse
of
curiosity,
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face,
she
as
often
found
him
looking
at
Jane
as
at
herself,
and
frequently
on
no
object
but
the
ground.
More
thoughtfulness
and
less
anxiety
to
please,
than
when
they
last
met,
were
plainly
expressed.
She
was
disappointed,
and
angry
with
herself
for
being
so.
"Could
I
expect
it
to
be
otherwise!"
said
she.
"Yet
why
did
he
come?"
She
was
in
no
humour
for
conversation
with
anyone
but
himself;
and
to
him
she
had
hardly
courage
to
speak.
She
inquired
after
his
sister,
but
could
do
no
more.
"It
is
a
long
time,
Mr.
Bingley,
since
you
went
away,"
said
Mrs.
Bennet.
He
readily
agreed
to
it.
"I
began
to
be
afraid
you
would
never
come
back
again.
People
did
say
you
meant
to
quit
the
place
entirely
at
Michaelmas;
but,
however,
I
hope
it
is
not
true.
A
great
many
changes
have
happened
in
the
neighbourhood,
since
you
went
away.
Miss
Lucas
is
married
and
settled.
And
one
of
my
own
daughters.
I
suppose
you
have
heard
of
it;
indeed,
you
must
have
seen
it
in
the
papers.
It
was
in
The
Times
and
The
Courier,
I
know;
though
it
was
not
put
in
as
it
ought
to
be.
It
was
only
said,
'Lately,
George
Wickham,
Esq.
to
Miss
Lydia
Bennet,'
without
there
being
a
syllable
said
of
her
father,
or
the
place
where
she
lived,
or
anything.
It
was
my
brother
Gardiner's
drawing
up
too,
and
I
wonder
how
he
came
to
make
such
an
awkward
business
of
it.
Did
you
see
it?"
Bingley
replied
that
he
did,
and
made
his
congratulations.
Elizabeth
dared
not
lift
up
her
eyes.
How
Mr.
Darcy
looked,
therefore,
she
could
not
tell.
"It
is
a
delightful
thing,
to
be
sure,
to
have
a
daughter
well
married,"
continued
her
mother,
"but
at
the
same
time,
Mr.
Bingley,
it
is
very
hard
to
have
her
taken
such
a
way
from
me.
They
are
gone
down
to
Newcastle,
a
place
quite
northward,
it
seems,
and
there
they
are
to
stay
I
do
not
know
how
long.
His
regiment
is
there;
for
I
suppose
you
have
heard
of
his
leaving
the
shire,
and
of
his
being
gone
into
the
regulars.
Thank
Heaven!
he
has
some
friends,
though
perhaps
not
so
many
as
he
deserves."
Elizabeth,
who
knew
this
to
be
levelled
at
Mr.
Darcy,
was
in
such
misery
of
shame,
that
she
could
hardly
keep
her
seat.
It
drew
from
her,
however,
the
exertion
of
speaking,
which
nothing
else
had
so
effectually
done
before;
and
she
asked
Bingley
whether
he
meant
to
make
any
stay
in
the
country
at
present.
A
few
weeks,
he
believed.
"When
you
have
killed
all
your
own
birds,
Mr.
Bingley,"
said
her
mother,
"I
beg
you
will
come
here,
and
shoot
as
many
as
you
please
on
Mr.
Bennet's
manor.
I
am
sure
he
will
be
vastly
happy
to
oblige
you,
and
will
save
all
the
best
of
the
covies
for
you."
Elizabeth's
misery
increased,
at
such
unnecessary,
such
officious
attention!
Were
the
same
fair
prospect
to
arise
at
present
as
had
flattered
them
a
year
ago,
every
thing,
she
was
persuaded,
would
be
hastening
to
the
same
vexatious
conclusion.
At
that
instant,
she
felt
that
years
of
happiness
could
not
make
Jane
or
herself
amends
for
moments
of
such
painful
confusion.
"The
first
wish
of
my
heart,"
said
she
to
herself,
"is
never
more
to
be
in
company
with
either
of
them.
Their
society
can
afford
no
pleasure
that
will
atone
for
such
wretchedness
as
this!
Let
me
never
see
either
one
or
the
other
again!"
Yet
the
misery,
for
which
years
of
happiness
were
to
offer
no
compensation,
received
soon
afterwards
material
relief,
from
observing
how
much
the
beauty
of
her
sister
re
kindled
the
admiration
of
her
former
lover.
When
first
he
came
in,
he
had
spoken
to
her
but
little;
but
every
five
minutes
seemed
to
be
giving
her
more
of
his
attention.
He
found
her
as
handsome
as
she
had
been
last
year;
as
good
natured,
and
as
unaffected,
though
not
quite
so
chatty.
Jane
was
anxious
that
no
difference
should
be
perceived
in
her
at
all,
and
was
really
persuaded
that
she
talked
as
much
as
ever.
But
her
mind
was
so
busily
engaged,
that
she
did
not
always
know
when
she
was
silent.
When
the
gentlemen
rose
to
go
away,
Mrs.
Bennet
was
mindful
of
her
intended
civility,
and
they
were
invited
and
engaged
to
dine
at
Longbourn
in
a
few
days
time.
"You
are
quite
a
visit
in
my
debt,
Mr.
Bingley,"
she
added,
"for
when
you
went
to
town
last
winter,
you
promised
to
take
a
family
dinner
with
us,
as
soon
as
you
returned.
I
have
not
forgot,
you
see;
and
I
assure
you,
I
was
very
much
disappointed
that
you
did
not
come
back
and
keep
your
engagement."
Bingley
looked
a
little
silly
at
this
reflection,
and
said
something
of
his
concern
at
having
been
prevented
by
business.
They
then
went
away.
Mrs.
Bennet
had
been
strongly
inclined
to
ask
them
to
stay
and
dine
there
that
day;
but,
though
she
always
kept
a
very
good
table,
she
did
not
think
anything
less
than
two
courses
could
be
good
enough
for
a
man
on
whom
she
had
such
anxious
designs,
or
satisfy
the
appetite
and
pride
of
one
who
had
ten
thousand
a
year.
As
soon
as
they
were
gone,
Elizabeth
