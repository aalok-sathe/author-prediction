it
is
strange;
it
is
out
of
the
common
course
that
what
is
so
evidently,
so
palpably
desirable
what
courts
the
pre
arrangement
of
other
people,
should
so
immediately
shape
itself
into
the
proper
form.
You
and
Mr.
Elton
are
by
situation
called
together;
you
belong
to
one
another
by
every
circumstance
of
your
respective
homes.
Your
marrying
will
be
equal
to
the
match
at
Randalls.
There
does
seem
to
be
a
something
in
the
air
of
Hartfield
which
gives
love
exactly
the
right
direction,
and
sends
it
into
the
very
channel
where
it
ought
to
flow.
The
course
of
true
love
never
did
run
smooth
A
Hartfield
edition
of
Shakespeare
would
have
a
long
note
on
that
passage."
"That
Mr.
Elton
should
really
be
in
love
with
me,
me,
of
all
people,
who
did
not
know
him,
to
speak
to
him,
at
Michaelmas!
And
he,
the
very
handsomest
man
that
ever
was,
and
a
man
that
every
body
looks
up
to,
quite
like
Mr.
Knightley!
His
company
so
sought
after,
that
every
body
says
he
need
not
eat
a
single
meal
by
himself
if
he
does
not
chuse
it;
that
he
has
more
invitations
than
there
are
days
in
the
week.
And
so
excellent
in
the
Church!
Miss
Nash
has
put
down
all
the
texts
he
has
ever
preached
from
since
he
came
to
Highbury.
Dear
me!
When
I
look
back
to
the
first
time
I
saw
him!
How
little
did
I
think!
The
two
Abbots
and
I
ran
into
the
front
room
and
peeped
through
the
blind
when
we
heard
he
was
going
by,
and
Miss
Nash
came
and
scolded
us
away,
and
staid
to
look
through
herself;
however,
she
called
me
back
presently,
and
let
me
look
too,
which
was
very
good
natured.
And
how
beautiful
we
thought
he
looked!
He
was
arm
in
arm
with
Mr.
Cole."
"This
is
an
alliance
which,
whoever
whatever
your
friends
may
be,
must
be
agreeable
to
them,
provided
at
least
they
have
common
sense;
and
we
are
not
to
be
addressing
our
conduct
to
fools.
If
they
are
anxious
to
see
you
happily
married,
here
is
a
man
whose
amiable
character
gives
every
assurance
of
it;
if
they
wish
to
have
you
settled
in
the
same
country
and
circle
which
they
have
chosen
to
place
you
in,
here
it
will
be
accomplished;
and
if
their
only
object
is
that
you
should,
in
the
common
phrase,
be
well
married,
here
is
the
comfortable
fortune,
the
respectable
establishment,
the
rise
in
the
world
which
must
satisfy
them."
"Yes,
very
true.
How
nicely
you
talk;
I
love
to
hear
you.
You
understand
every
thing.
You
and
Mr.
Elton
are
one
as
clever
as
the
other.
This
charade!
If
I
had
studied
a
twelvemonth,
I
could
never
have
made
any
thing
like
it."
"I
thought
he
meant
to
try
his
skill,
by
his
manner
of
declining
it
yesterday."
"I
do
think
it
is,
without
exception,
the
best
charade
I
ever
read."
"I
never
read
one
more
to
the
purpose,
certainly."
"It
is
as
long
again
as
almost
all
we
have
had
before."
"I
do
not
consider
its
length
as
particularly
in
its
favour.
Such
things
in
general
cannot
be
too
short."
Harriet
was
too
intent
on
the
lines
to
hear.
The
most
satisfactory
comparisons
were
rising
in
her
mind.
"It
is
one
thing,"
said
she,
presently
her
cheeks
in
a
glow
"to
have
very
good
sense
in
a
common
way,
like
every
body
else,
and
if
there
is
any
thing
to
say,
to
sit
down
and
write
a
letter,
and
say
just
what
you
must,
in
a
short
way;
and
another,
to
write
verses
and
charades
like
this."
Emma
could
not
have
desired
a
more
spirited
rejection
of
Mr.
Martin's
prose.
"Such
sweet
lines!"
continued
Harriet
"these
two
last!
But
how
shall
I
ever
be
able
to
return
the
paper,
or
say
I
have
found
it
out?
Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
what
can
we
do
about
that?"
"Leave
it
to
me.
You
do
nothing.
He
will
be
here
this
evening,
I
dare
say,
and
then
I
will
give
it
him
back,
and
some
nonsense
or
other
will
pass
between
us,
and
you
shall
not
be
committed.
Your
soft
eyes
shall
chuse
their
own
time
for
beaming.
Trust
to
me."
"Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
what
a
pity
that
I
must
not
write
this
beautiful
charade
into
my
book!
I
am
sure
I
have
not
got
one
half
so
good."
"Leave
out
the
two
last
lines,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
write
it
into
your
book."
"Oh!
but
those
two
lines
are"
"The
best
of
all.
Granted;
for
private
enjoyment;
and
for
private
enjoyment
keep
them.
They
are
not
at
all
the
less
written
you
know,
because
you
divide
them.
The
couplet
does
not
cease
to
be,
nor
does
its
meaning
change.
But
take
it
away,
and
all
appropriation
ceases,
and
a
very
pretty
gallant
charade
remains,
fit
for
any
collection.
Depend
upon
it,
he
would
not
like
to
have
his
charade
slighted,
much
better
than
his
passion.
A
poet
in
love
must
be
encouraged
in
both
capacities,
or
neither.
Give
me
the
book,
I
will
write
it
down,
and
then
there
can
be
no
possible
reflection
on
you."
Harriet
submitted,
though
her
mind
could
hardly
separate
the
parts,
so
as
to
feel
quite
sure
that
her
friend
were
not
writing
down
a
declaration
of
love.
It
seemed
too
precious
an
offering
for
any
degree
of
publicity.
"I
shall
never
let
that
book
go
out
of
my
own
hands,"
said
she.
"Very
well,"
replied
Emma;
"a
most
natural
feeling;
and
the
longer
it
lasts,
the
better
I
shall
be
pleased.
But
here
is
my
father
coming:
you
will
not
object
to
my
reading
the
charade
to
him.
It
will
be
giving
him
so
much
pleasure!
He
loves
any
thing
of
the
sort,
and
especially
any
thing
that
pays
woman
a
compliment.
He
has
the
tenderest
spirit
of
gallantry
towards
us
all!
You
must
let
