reviving
after
such
hurricanes
to
feel
calm
return,
and
from
the
opening
clouds
to
receive
a
consolatory
gleam,
softly
testifying
that
the
sun
is
not
quenched."
"Miss
Keeldar,
just
stand
still
now,
and
look
down
at
Nunnely
dale
and
wood."
They
both
halted
on
the
green
brow
of
the
common.
They
looked
down
on
the
deep
valley
robed
in
May
raiment;
on
varied
meads,
some
pearled
with
daisies,
and
some
golden
with
king
cups.
To
day
all
this
young
verdure
smiled
clear
in
sunlight;
transparent
emerald
and
amber
gleams
played
over
it.
On
Nunnwood
the
sole
remnant
of
antique
British
forest
in
a
region
whose
lowlands
were
once
all
silvan
chase,
as
its
highlands
were
breast
deep
heather
slept
the
shadow
of
a
cloud;
the
distant
hills
were
dappled,
the
horizon
was
shaded
and
tinted
like
mother
of
pearl;
silvery
blues,
soft
purples,
evanescent
greens
and
rose
shades,
all
melting
into
fleeces
of
white
cloud,
pure
as
azury
snow,
allured
the
eye
as
with
a
remote
glimpse
of
heaven's
foundations.
The
air
blowing
on
the
brow
was
fresh,
and
sweet,
and
bracing.
"Our
England
is
a
bonny
island,"
said
Shirley,
"and
Yorkshire
is
one
of
her
bonniest
nooks."
"You
are
a
Yorkshire
girl
too?"
"I
am
Yorkshire
in
blood
and
birth.
Five
generations
of
my
race
sleep
under
the
aisles
of
Briarfield
Church.
I
drew
my
first
breath
in
the
old
black
hall
behind
us."
Hereupon
Caroline
presented
her
hand,
which
was
accordingly
taken
and
shaken.
"We
are
compatriots,"
said
she.
"Yes,"
agreed
Shirley,
with
a
grave
nod.
"And
that,"
asked
Miss
Keeldar,
pointing
to
the
forest
"that
is
Nunnwood?"
"It
is."
"Were
you
ever
there?"
"Many
a
time."
"In
the
heart
of
it?"
"Yes."
"What
is
it
like?"
"It
is
like
an
encampment
of
forest
sons
of
Anak.
The
trees
are
huge
and
old.
When
you
stand
at
their
roots,
the
summits
seem
in
another
region.
The
trunks
remain
still
and
firm
as
pillars,
while
the
boughs
sway
to
every
breeze.
In
the
deepest
calm
their
leaves
are
never
quite
hushed,
and
in
high
wind
a
flood
rushes,
a
sea
thunders
above
you."
"Was
it
not
one
of
Robin
Hood's
haunts?"
"Yes,
and
there
are
mementos
of
him
still
existing.
To
penetrate
into
Nunnwood,
Miss
Keeldar,
is
to
go
far
back
into
the
dim
days
of
old.
Can
you
see
a
break
in
the
forest,
about
the
centre?"
"Yes,
distinctly."
"That
break
is
a
dell
a
deep,
hollow
cup,
lined
with
turf
as
green
and
short
as
the
sod
of
this
common.
The
very
oldest
of
the
trees,
gnarled
mighty
oaks,
crowd
about
the
brink
of
this
dell.
In
the
bottom
lie
the
ruins
of
a
nunnery."
"We
will
go
you
and
I
alone,
Caroline
to
that
wood,
early
some
fine
summer
morning,
and
spend
a
long
day
there.
We
can
take
pencils
and
sketch
books,
and
any
interesting
reading
book
we
like;
and
of
course
we
shall
take
something
to
eat.
I
have
two
little
baskets,
in
which
Mrs.
Gill,
my
housekeeper,
might
pack
our
provisions,
and
we
could
each
carry
our
own.
It
would
not
tire
you
too
much
to
walk
so
far?"
"Oh
no;
especially
if
we
rested
the
whole
day
in
the
wood.
And
I
know
all
the
pleasantest
spots.
I
know
where
we
could
get
nuts
in
nutting
time;
I
know
where
wild
strawberries
abound;
I
know
certain
lonely,
quite
untrodden
glades,
carpeted
with
strange
mosses,
some
yellow
as
if
gilded,
some
a
sober
gray,
some
gem
green.
I
know
groups
of
trees
that
ravish
the
eye
with
their
perfect,
picture
like
effects
rude
oak,
delicate
birch,
glossy
beech,
clustered
in
contrast;
and
ash
trees
stately
as
Saul,
standing
isolated;
and
superannuated
wood
giants
clad
in
bright
shrouds
of
ivy.
Miss
Keeldar,
I
could
guide
you."
"You
would
be
dull
with
me
alone?"
"I
should
not.
I
think
we
should
suit;
and
what
third
person
is
there
whose
presence
would
not
spoil
our
pleasure?"
"Indeed,
I
know
of
none
about
our
own
ages
no
lady
at
least;
and
as
to
gentlemen
"
"An
excursion
becomes
quite
a
different
thing
when
there
are
gentlemen
of
the
party,"
interrupted
Caroline.
"I
agree
with
you
quite
a
different
thing
to
what
we
were
proposing."
"We
were
going
simply
to
see
the
old
trees,
the
old
ruins;
to
pass
a
day
in
old
times,
surrounded
by
olden
silence,
and
above
all
by
quietude."
"You
are
right;
and
the
presence
of
gentlemen
dispels
the
last
charm,
I
think.
If
they
are
of
the
wrong
sort,
like
your
Malones,
and
your
young
Sykes,
and
Wynnes,
irritation
takes
the
place
of
serenity.
If
they
are
of
the
right
sort,
there
is
still
a
change;
I
can
hardly
tell
what
change
one
easy
to
feel,
difficult
to
describe."
"We
forget
Nature,
imprimis."
"And
then
Nature
forgets
us,
covers
her
vast
calm
brow
with
a
dim
veil,
conceals
her
face,
and
withdraws
the
peaceful
joy
with
which,
if
we
had
been
content
to
worship
her
only,
she
would
have
filled
our
hearts."
"What
does
she
give
us
instead?"
"More
elation
and
more
anxiety;
an
excitement
that
steals
the
hours
away
fast,
and
a
trouble
that
ruffles
their
course."
"Our
power
of
being
happy
lies
a
good
deal
in
ourselves,
I
believe,"
remarked
Caroline
sagely.
"I
have
gone
to
Nunnwood
with
a
large
party
all
the
curates
and
some
other
gentry
of
these
parts,
together
with
sundry
ladies
and
I
found
the
affair
insufferably
tedious
and
absurd;
and
I
have
gone
quite
alone,
or
accompanied
but
by
Fanny,
who
sat
in
the
woodman's
hut
and
sewed,
or
talked
to
the
goodwife,
while
I
roamed
about
and
made
sketches,
or
read;
and
I
have
enjoyed
much
happiness
of
a
quiet
kind
all
day
long.
But
that
was
when
I
was
young
two
years
ago."
"Did
you
ever
go
with
your
cousin,
Robert
Moore?"
"Yes;
once."
"What
sort
of
a
companion
is
he
on
these
occasions?"
"A
cousin,
you
know,
is
different
to
a
stranger."
"I
