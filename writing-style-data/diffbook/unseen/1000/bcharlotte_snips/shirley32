it
unjust
to
include
all
poor
working
people
under
the
general
and
insulting
name
of
'the
mob,'
and
continually
to
think
of
them
and
treat
them
haughtily."
"You
are
a
little
democrat,
Caroline.
If
your
uncle
knew,
what
would
he
say?"
"I
rarely
talk
to
my
uncle,
as
you
know,
and
never
about
such
things.
He
thinks
everything
but
sewing
and
cooking
above
women's
comprehension,
and
out
of
their
line."
"And
do
you
fancy
you
comprehend
the
subjects
on
which
you
advise
me?"
"As
far
as
they
concern
you,
I
comprehend
them.
I
know
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
be
loved
by
your
workpeople
than
to
be
hated
by
them,
and
I
am
sure
that
kindness
is
more
likely
to
win
their
regard
than
pride.
If
you
were
proud
and
cold
to
me
and
Hortense,
should
we
love
you?
When
you
are
cold
to
me,
as
you
are
sometimes,
can
I
venture
to
be
affectionate
in
return?"
"Now,
Lina,
I've
had
my
lesson
both
in
languages
and
ethics,
with
a
touch
on
politics;
it
is
your
turn.
Hortense
tells
me
you
were
much
taken
by
a
little
piece
of
poetry
you
learned
the
other
day,
a
piece
by
poor
Andre
Chenier
'La
Jeune
Captive.'
Do
you
remember
it
still?"
"I
think
so."
"Repeat
it,
then.
Take
your
time
and
mind
your
accent;
especially
let
us
have
no
English
u's."
Caroline,
beginning
in
a
low,
rather
tremulous
voice,
but
gaining
courage
as
she
proceeded,
repeated
the
sweet
verses
of
Chenier.
The
last
three
stanzas
she
rehearsed
well.
"Mon
beau
voyage
encore
est
si
loin
de
sa
fin!
Je
pars,
et
des
ormeaux
qui
bordent
le
chemin
J'ai
passe
le
premiers
a
peine.
Au
banquet
de
la
vie
a
peine
commence,
Un
instant
seulement
mes
levres
ont
presse
La
coupe
en
mes
mains
encore
pleine.
"Je
ne
suis
qu'au
printemps
je
veux
voir
la
moisson;
Et
comme
le
soleil,
de
saison
en
saison,
Je
veux
achever
mon
annee,
Brillante
sur
ma
tige,
et
l'honneur
du
jardin
Je
n'ai
vu
luire
encore
que
les
feux
du
matin,
Je
veux
achever
ma
journee!"
Moore
listened
at
first
with
his
eyes
cast
down,
but
soon
he
furtively
raised
them.
Leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
could
watch
Caroline
without
her
perceiving
where
his
gaze
was
fixed.
Her
cheek
had
a
colour,
her
eyes
a
light,
her
countenance
an
expression
this
evening
which
would
have
made
even
plain
features
striking;
but
there
was
not
the
grievous
defect
of
plainness
to
pardon
in
her
case.
The
sunshine
was
not
shed
on
rough
barrenness;
it
fell
on
soft
bloom.
Each
lineament
was
turned
with
grace;
the
whole
aspect
was
pleasing.
At
the
present
moment
animated,
interested,
touched
she
might
be
called
beautiful.
Such
a
face
was
calculated
to
awaken
not
only
the
calm
sentiment
of
esteem,
the
distant
one
of
admiration,
but
some
feeling
more
tender,
genial,
intimate
friendship,
perhaps,
affection,
interest.
When
she
had
finished,
she
turned
to
Moore,
and
met
his
eye.
"Is
that
pretty
well
repeated?"
she
inquired,
smiling
like
any
happy,
docile
child.
"I
really
don't
know."
"Why
don't
you
know?
Have
you
not
listened?"
"Yes
and
looked.
You
are
fond
of
poetry,
Lina?"
"When
I
meet
with
real
poetry,
I
cannot
rest
till
I
have
learned
it
by
heart,
and
so
made
it
partly
mine."
Mr.
Moore
now
sat
silent
for
several
minutes.
It
struck
nine
o'clock.
Sarah
entered,
and
said
that
Mr.
Helstone's
servant
was
come
for
Miss
Caroline.
"Then
the
evening
is
gone
already,"
she
observed,
"and
it
will
be
long,
I
suppose,
before
I
pass
another
here."
Hortense
had
been
for
some
time
nodding
over
her
knitting;
fallen
into
a
doze
now,
she
made
no
response
to
the
remark.
"You
would
have
no
objection
to
come
here
oftener
of
an
evening?"
inquired
Robert,
as
he
took
her
folded
mantle
from
the
side
table,
where
it
still
lay,
and
carefully
wrapped
it
round
her.
"I
like
to
come
here;
but
I
have
no
desire
to
be
intrusive.
I
am
not
hinting
to
be
asked;
you
must
understand
that."
"Oh!
I
understand
thee,
child.
You
sometimes
lecture
me
for
wishing
to
be
rich,
Lina;
but
if
I
were
rich,
you
should
live
here
always
at
any
rate,
you
should
live
with
me
wherever
my
habitation
might
be."
"That
would
be
pleasant;
and
if
you
were
poor
ever
so
poor
it
would
still
be
pleasant.
Good
night,
Robert."
"I
promised
to
walk
with
you
up
to
the
rectory."
"I
know
you
did;
but
I
thought
you
had
forgotten,
and
I
hardly
knew
how
to
remind
you,
though
I
wished
to
do
it.
But
would
you
like
to
go?
It
is
a
cold
night,
and
as
Fanny
is
come,
there
is
no
necessity
"
"Here
is
your
muff;
don't
wake
Hortense
come."
The
half
mile
to
the
rectory
was
soon
traversed.
They
parted
in
the
garden
without
kiss,
scarcely
with
a
pressure
of
hands;
yet
Robert
sent
his
cousin
in
excited
and
joyously
troubled.
He
had
been
singularly
kind
to
her
that
day
not
in
phrase,
compliment,
profession,
but
in
manner,
in
look,
and
in
soft
and
friendly
tones.
For
himself,
he
came
home
grave,
almost
morose.
As
he
stood
leaning
on
his
own
yard
gate,
musing
in
the
watery
moonlight
all
alone,
the
hushed,
dark
mill
before
him,
the
hill
environed
hollow
round,
he
exclaimed,
abruptly,
"This
won't
do!
There's
weakness
there's
downright
ruin
in
all
this.
However,"
he
added,
dropping
his
voice,
"the
frenzy
is
quite
temporary.
I
know
it
very
well;
I
have
had
it
before.
It
will
be
gone
to
morrow."
Caroline
Helstone
was
just
eighteen
years
old,
and
at
eighteen
the
true
narrative
of
life
is
yet
to
be
commenced.
Before
that
time
we
sit
listening
to
a
tale,
a
marvellous
fiction,
delightful
sometimes,
and
sad
sometimes,
almost
always
unreal.
Before
that
time
our
world
is
heroic,
its
inhabitants
half
divine
or
semi
demon;
its
scenes
are
dream
scenes;
darker
woods
and
stranger
hills,
brighter
skies,
more
