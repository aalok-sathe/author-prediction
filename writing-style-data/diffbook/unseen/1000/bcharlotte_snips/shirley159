consulting
the
mirror,
it
reflected
an
unanimous
vote
against
her.
"You
must
go,"
said
Mr.
Hall,
"and
behave
courteously
too.
You
owe
many
duties
to
society.
It
is
not
permitted
you
to
please
only
yourself."
Louis
Moore
assented
with
a
low
"Hear,
hear!"
Caroline,
approaching
her,
smoothed
her
wavy
curls,
gave
to
her
attire
a
less
artistic
and
more
domestic
grace,
and
Shirley
was
put
out
of
the
room,
protesting
still,
by
a
pouting
lip,
against
her
dismissal.
"There
is
a
curious
charm
about
her,"
observed
Mr.
Hall,
when
she
was
gone.
"And
now,"
he
added,
"I
must
away;
for
Sweeting
is
off
to
see
his
mother,
and
there
are
two
funerals."
"Henry,
get
your
books;
it
is
lesson
time,"
said
Moore,
sitting
down
to
his
desk.
"A
curious
charm!"
repeated
the
pupil,
when
he
and
his
master
were
left
alone.
"True.
Is
she
not
a
kind
of
white
witch?"
he
asked.
"Of
whom
are
you
speaking,
sir?"
"Of
my
cousin
Shirley."
"No
irrelevant
questions;
study
in
silence."
Mr.
Moore
looked
and
spoke
sternly
sourly.
Henry
knew
this
mood.
It
was
a
rare
one
with
his
tutor;
but
when
it
came
he
had
an
awe
of
it.
He
obeyed.
Miss
Keeldar
and
her
uncle
had
characters
that
would
not
harmonize,
that
never
had
harmonized.
He
was
irritable,
and
she
was
spirited.
He
was
despotic,
and
she
liked
freedom.
He
was
worldly,
and
she,
perhaps,
romantic.
Not
without
purpose
had
he
come
down
to
Yorkshire.
His
mission
was
clear,
and
he
intended
to
discharge
it
conscientiously.
He
anxiously
desired
to
have
his
niece
married,
to
make
for
her
a
suitable
match,
give
her
in
charge
to
a
proper
husband,
and
wash
his
hands
of
her
for
ever.
The
misfortune
was,
from
infancy
upwards,
Shirley
and
he
had
disagreed
on
the
meaning
of
the
words
"suitable"
and
"proper."
She
never
yet
had
accepted
his
definition;
and
it
was
doubtful
whether,
in
the
most
important
step
of
her
life,
she
would
consent
to
accept
it.
The
trial
soon
came.
Mr.
Wynne
proposed
in
form
for
his
son,
Samuel
Fawthrop
Wynne.
"Decidedly
suitable!
most
proper!"
pronounced
Mr.
Sympson.
"A
fine
unencumbered
estate,
real
substance,
good
connections.
It
must
be
done!"
He
sent
for
his
niece
to
the
oak
parlour;
he
shut
himself
up
there
with
her
alone;
he
communicated
the
offer;
he
gave
his
opinion;
he
claimed
her
consent.
It
was
withheld.
"No;
I
shall
not
marry
Samuel
Fawthrop
Wynne."
"I
ask
why.
I
must
have
a
reason.
In
all
respects
he
is
more
than
worthy
of
you."
She
stood
on
the
hearth.
She
was
pale
as
the
white
marble
slab
and
cornice
behind
her;
her
eyes
flashed
large,
dilated,
unsmiling.
"And
I
ask
in
what
sense
that
young
man
is
worthy
of
me?"
"He
has
twice
your
money,
twice
your
common
sense,
equal
connections,
equal
respectability."
"Had
he
my
money
counted
fivescore
times
I
would
take
no
vow
to
love
him."
"Please
to
state
your
objections."
"He
has
run
a
course
of
despicable,
commonplace
profligacy.
Accept
that
as
the
first
reason
why
I
spurn
him."
"Miss
Keeldar,
you
shock
me!"
"That
conduct
alone
sinks
him
in
a
gulf
of
immeasurable
inferiority.
His
intellect
reaches
no
standard
I
can
esteem:
there
is
a
second
stumbling
block.
His
views
are
narrow,
his
feelings
are
blunt,
his
tastes
are
coarse,
his
manners
vulgar."
"The
man
is
a
respectable,
wealthy
man!
To
refuse
him
is
presumption
on
your
part."
"I
refuse
point
blank!
Cease
to
annoy
me
with
the
subject;
I
forbid
it!"
"Is
it
your
intention
ever
to
marry;
or
do
you
prefer
celibacy?"
"I
deny
your
right
to
claim
an
answer
to
that
question."
"May
I
ask
if
you
expect
some
man
of
title
some
peer
of
the
realm
to
demand
your
hand?"
"I
doubt
if
the
peer
breathes
on
whom
I
would
confer
it."
"Were
there
insanity
in
the
family,
I
should
believe
you
mad.
Your
eccentricity
and
conceit
touch
the
verge
of
frenzy."
"Perhaps,
ere
I
have
finished,
you
will
see
me
over
leap
it."
"I
anticipate
no
less.
Frantic
and
impracticable
girl!
Take
warning!
I
dare
you
to
sully
our
name
by
a
mesalliance!"
"Our
name!
Am
I
called
Sympson?"
"God
be
thanked
that
you
are
not!
But
be
on
your
guard;
I
will
not
be
trifled
with!"
"What,
in
the
name
of
common
law
and
common
sense,
would
you
or
could
you
do
if
my
pleasure
led
me
to
a
choice
you
disapproved?"
"Take
care!
take
care!"
warning
her
with
voice
and
hand
that
trembled
alike.
"Why?
What
shadow
of
power
have
you
over
me?
Why
should
I
fear
you?"
"Take
care,
madam!"
"Scrupulous
care
I
will
take,
Mr.
Sympson.
Before
I
marry
I
am
resolved
to
esteem
to
admire
to
love."
"Preposterous
stuff!
indecorous,
unwomanly!"
"To
love
with
my
whole
heart.
I
know
I
speak
in
an
unknown
tongue;
but
I
feel
indifferent
whether
I
am
comprehended
or
not."
"And
if
this
love
of
yours
should
fall
on
a
beggar?"
"On
a
beggar
it
will
never
fall.
Mendicancy
is
not
estimable."
"On
a
low
clerk,
a
play
actor,
a
play
writer,
or
or
"
"Take
courage,
Mr.
Sympson!
Or
what?"
"Any
literary
scrub,
or
shabby,
whining
artist."
"For
the
scrubby,
shabby,
whining
I
have
no
taste;
for
literature
and
the
arts
I
have.
And
there
I
wonder
how
your
Fawthrop
Wynne
would
suit
me.
He
cannot
write
a
note
without
orthographical
errors;
he
reads
only
a
sporting
paper;
he
was
the
booby
of
Stilbro'
grammar
school!"
"Unladylike
language!
Great
God!
to
what
will
she
come?"
He
lifted
hands
and
eyes.
"Never
to
the
altar
of
Hymen
with
Sam
Wynne."
"To
what
will
she
come?
Why
are
not
the
laws
more
stringent,
that
I
might
compel
her
to
hear
reason?"
"Console
yourself,
uncle.
Were
Britain
a
serfdom
and
you
the
Czar,
you
could
not
compel
me
to
this
step.
I
will
write
to
Mr.
Wynne.
Give
yourself
no
further
trouble
on
the
subject."
