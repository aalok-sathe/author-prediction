narrow
rules,
your
little
prejudices,
aversions,
dogmas,
bundle
them
off.
Mr.
Sympson,
go,
offer
them
a
sacrifice
to
the
deity
you
worship;
I'll
none
of
them.
I
wash
my
hands
of
the
lot.
I
walk
by
another
creed,
light,
faith,
and
hope
than
you."
"Another
creed!
I
believe
she
is
an
infidel."
"An
infidel
to
your
religion,
an
atheist
to
your
god."
"An
atheist!!!"
"Your
god,
sir,
is
the
world.
In
my
eyes
you
too,
if
not
an
infidel,
are
an
idolater.
I
conceive
that
you
ignorantly
worship;
in
all
things
you
appear
to
me
too
superstitious.
Sir,
your
god,
your
great
Bel,
your
fish
tailed
Dagon,
rises
before
me
as
a
demon.
You,
and
such
as
you,
have
raised
him
to
a
throne,
put
on
him
a
crown,
given
him
a
sceptre.
Behold
how
hideously
he
governs!
See
him
busied
at
the
work
he
likes
best
making
marriages.
He
binds
the
young
to
the
old,
the
strong
to
the
imbecile.
He
stretches
out
the
arm
of
Mezentius,
and
fetters
the
dead
to
the
living.
In
his
realm
there
is
hatred
secret
hatred;
there
is
disgust
unspoken
disgust;
there
is
treachery
family
treachery;
there
is
vice
deep,
deadly
domestic
vice.
In
his
dominions
children
grow
unloving
between
parents
who
have
never
loved;
infants
are
nursed
on
deception
from
their
very
birth;
they
are
reared
in
an
atmosphere
corrupt
with
lies.
Your
god
rules
at
the
bridal
of
kings;
look
at
your
royal
dynasties!
Your
deity
is
the
deity
of
foreign
aristocracies;
analyze
the
blue
blood
of
Spain!
Your
god
is
the
Hymen
of
France;
what
is
French
domestic
life?
All
that
surrounds
him
hastens
to
decay;
all
declines
and
degenerates
under
his
sceptre.
Your
god
is
a
masked
Death."
"This
language
is
terrible!
My
daughters
and
you
must
associate
no
longer,
Miss
Keeldar;
there
is
danger
in
such
companionship.
Had
I
known
you
a
little
earlier
but,
extraordinary
as
I
thought
you,
I
could
not
have
believed
"
"Now,
sir,
do
you
begin
to
be
aware
that
it
is
useless
to
scheme
for
me;
that
in
doing
so
you
but
sow
the
wind
to
reap
the
whirlwind?
I
sweep
your
cobweb
projects
from
my
path,
that
I
may
pass
on
unsullied.
I
am
anchored
on
a
resolve
you
cannot
shake.
My
heart,
my
conscience
shall
dispose
of
my
hand
they
only.
Know
this
at
last."
Mr.
Sympson
was
becoming
a
little
bewildered.
"Never
heard
such
language!"
he
muttered
again
and
again;
"never
was
so
addressed
in
my
life
never
was
so
used!"
"You
are
quite
confused,
sir.
You
had
better
withdraw,
or
I
will."
He
rose
hastily.
"We
must
leave
this
place;
they
must
pack
up
at
once."
"Do
not
hurry
my
aunt
and
cousins;
give
them
time."
"No
more
intercourse;
she's
not
proper."
He
made
his
way
to
the
door.
He
came
back
for
his
handkerchief.
He
dropped
his
snuff
box,
leaving
the
contents
scattered
on
the
carpet;
he
stumbled
out.
Tartar
lay
outside
across
the
mat;
Mr.
Sympson
almost
fell
over
him.
In
the
climax
of
his
exasperation
he
hurled
an
oath
at
the
dog
and
a
coarse
epithet
at
his
mistress.
"Poor
Mr.
Sympson!
he
is
both
feeble
and
vulgar,"
said
Shirley
to
herself.
"My
head
aches,
and
I
am
tired,"
she
added;
and
leaning
her
head
upon
a
cushion,
she
softly
subsided
from
excitement
to
repose.
One,
entering
the
room
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards,
found
her
asleep.
When
Shirley
had
been
agitated,
she
generally
took
this
natural
refreshment;
it
would
come
at
her
call.
The
intruder
paused
in
her
unconscious
presence,
and
said,
"Miss
Keeldar."
Perhaps
his
voice
harmonized
with
some
dream
into
which
she
was
passing.
It
did
not
startle,
it
hardly
roused
her.
Without
opening
her
eyes,
she
but
turned
her
head
a
little,
so
that
her
cheek
and
profile,
before
hidden
by
her
arm,
became
visible.
She
looked
rosy,
happy,
half
smiling,
but
her
eyelashes
were
wet.
She
had
wept
in
slumber;
or
perhaps,
before
dropping
asleep,
a
few
natural
tears
had
fallen
after
she
had
heard
that
epithet.
No
man
no
woman
is
always
strong,
always
able
to
bear
up
against
the
unjust
opinion,
the
vilifying
word.
Calumny,
even
from
the
mouth
of
a
fool,
will
sometimes
cut
into
unguarded
feelings.
Shirley
looked
like
a
child
that
had
been
naughty
and
punished,
but
was
now
forgiven
and
at
rest.
"Miss
Keeldar,"
again
said
the
voice.
This
time
it
woke
her.
She
looked
up,
and
saw
at
her
side
Louis
Moore
not
close
at
her
side,
but
standing,
with
arrested
step,
two
or
three
yards
from
her.
"O
Mr.
Moore!"
she
said.
"I
was
afraid
it
was
my
uncle
again:
he
and
I
have
quarrelled."
"Mr.
Sympson
should
let
you
alone,"
was
the
reply.
"Can
he
not
see
that
you
are
as
yet
far
from
strong?"
"I
assure
you
he
did
not
find
me
weak.
I
did
not
cry
when
he
was
here."
"He
is
about
to
evacuate
Fieldhead
so
he
says.
He
is
now
giving
orders
to
his
family.
He
has
been
in
the
schoolroom
issuing
commands
in
a
manner
which,
I
suppose,
was
a
continuation
of
that
with
which
he
has
harassed
you."
"Are
you
and
Henry
to
go?"
"I
believe,
as
far
as
Henry
is
concerned,
that
was
the
tenor
of
his
scarcely
intelligible
directions;
but
he
may
change
all
to
morrow.
He
is
just
in
that
mood
when
you
cannot
depend
on
his
consistency
for
two
consecutive
hours.
I
doubt
whether
he
will
leave
you
for
weeks
yet.
To
myself
he
addressed
some
words
which
will
require
a
little
attention
and
comment
by
and
by,
when
I
have
time
to
bestow
on
them.
At
the
moment
he
came
in
I
was
busied
with
a
note
I
had
got
from
Mr.
Yorke
so
fully
busied
that
I
cut
short
the
interview
with
him
somewhat
abruptly.
I
left
him
raving.
Here
is
the
note.
I
wish
you
to
see
it.
It
refers
to
my
brother
Robert."
And
he
looked
