built
ere
that
highway
was
cut,
and
when
a
lane
winding
up
through
fields
was
the
only
path
conducting
to
it.
Briarfield
lay
scarce
a
mile
off;
its
hum
was
heard,
its
glare
distinctly
seen.
Briar
Chapel,
a
large,
new,
raw
Wesleyan
place
of
worship,
rose
but
a
hundred
yards
distant;
and
as
there
was
even
now
a
prayer
meeting
being
held
within
its
walls,
the
illumination
of
its
windows
cast
a
bright
reflection
on
the
road,
while
a
hymn
of
a
most
extraordinary
description,
such
as
a
very
Quaker
might
feel
himself
moved
by
the
Spirit
to
dance
to,
roused
cheerily
all
the
echoes
of
the
vicinage.
The
words
were
distinctly
audible
by
snatches.
Here
is
a
quotation
or
two
from
different
strains;
for
the
singers
passed
jauntily
from
hymn
to
hymn
and
from
tune
to
tune,
with
an
ease
and
buoyancy
all
their
own:
"Oh!
who
can
explain
This
struggle
for
life,
This
travail
and
pain,
This
trembling
and
strife?
Plague,
earthquake,
and
famine,
And
tumult
and
war,
The
wonderful
coming
Of
Jesus
declare!
"For
every
fight
Is
dreadful
and
loud:
The
warrior's
delight
Is
slaughter
and
blood,
His
foes
overturning,
Till
all
shall
expire:
And
this
is
with
burning,
And
fuel,
and
fire!"
Here
followed
an
interval
of
clamorous
prayer,
accompanied
by
fearful
groans.
A
shout
of
"I've
found
liberty!"
"Doad
o'
Bill's
has
fun'
liberty!"
rang
from
the
chapel,
and
out
all
the
assembly
broke
again.
"What
a
mercy
is
this!
What
a
heaven
of
bliss!
How
unspeakably
happy
am
I!
Gathered
into
the
fold,
With
Thy
people
enrolled,
With
Thy
people
to
live
and
to
die!
"Oh,
the
goodness
of
God
In
employing
a
clod
His
tribute
of
glory
to
raise;
His
standard
to
bear,
And
with
triumph
declare
His
unspeakable
riches
of
grace!
"Oh,
the
fathomless
love
That
has
deigned
to
approve
And
prosper
the
work
of
my
hands.
With
my
pastoral
crook
I
went
over
the
brook,
And
behold
I
am
spread
into
bands!
"Who,
I
ask
in
amaze,
Hath
begotten
me
these?
And
inquire
from
what
quarter
they
came.
My
full
heart
it
replies,
They
are
born
from
the
skies,
And
gives
glory
to
God
and
the
Lamb!"
The
stanza
which
followed
this,
after
another
and
longer
interregnum
of
shouts,
yells,
ejaculations,
frantic
cries,
agonized
groans,
seemed
to
cap
the
climax
of
noise
and
zeal.
"Sleeping
on
the
brink
of
sin,
Tophet
gaped
to
take
us
in;
Mercy
to
our
rescue
flew,
Broke
the
snare,
and
brought
us
through.
"Here,
as
in
a
lion's
den,
Undevoured
we
still
remain,
Pass
secure
the
watery
flood,
Hanging
on
the
arm
of
God.
"Here
"
(Terrible,
most
distracting
to
the
ear,
was
the
strained
shout
in
which
the
last
stanza
was
given.)
"Here
we
raise
our
voices
higher,
Shout
in
the
refiner's
fire,
Clap
our
hands
amidst
the
flame,
Glory
give
to
Jesus'
name!"
The
roof
of
the
chapel
did
not
fly
off,
which
speaks
volumes
in
praise
of
its
solid
slating.
But
if
Briar
Chapel
seemed
alive,
so
also
did
Briarmains,
though
certainly
the
mansion
appeared
to
enjoy
a
quieter
phase
of
existence
than
the
temple.
Some
of
its
windows
too
were
aglow;
the
lower
casements
opened
upon
the
lawn;
curtains
concealed
the
interior,
and
partly
obscured
the
ray
of
the
candles
which
lit
it,
but
they
did
not
entirely
muffle
the
sound
of
voice
and
laughter.
We
are
privileged
to
enter
that
front
door,
and
to
penetrate
to
the
domestic
sanctum.
It
is
not
the
presence
of
company
which
makes
Mr.
Yorke's
habitation
lively,
for
there
is
none
within
it
save
his
own
family,
and
they
are
assembled
in
that
farthest
room
to
the
right,
the
back
parlour.
This
is
the
usual
sitting
room
of
an
evening.
Those
windows
would
be
seen
by
daylight
to
be
of
brilliantly
stained
glass,
purple
and
amber
the
predominant
hues,
glittering
round
a
gravely
tinted
medallion
in
the
centre
of
each,
representing
the
suave
head
of
William
Shakespeare,
and
the
serene
one
of
John
Milton.
Some
Canadian
views
hung
on
the
walls
green
forest
and
blue
water
scenery
and
in
the
midst
of
them
blazes
a
night
eruption
of
Vesuvius;
very
ardently
it
glows,
contrasted
with
the
cool
foam
and
azure
of
cataracts,
and
the
dusky
depths
of
woods.
The
fire
illuminating
this
room,
reader,
is
such
as,
if
you
be
a
southern,
you
do
not
often
see
burning
on
the
hearth
of
a
private
apartment.
It
is
a
clear,
hot
coal
fire,
heaped
high
in
the
ample
chimney.
Mr.
Yorke
will
have
such
fires
even
in
warm
summer
weather.
He
sits
beside
it
with
a
book
in
his
hand,
a
little
round
stand
at
his
elbow
supporting
a
candle;
but
he
is
not
reading
he
is
watching
his
children.
Opposite
to
him
sits
his
lady
a
personage
whom
I
might
describe
minutely,
but
I
feel
no
vocation
to
the
task.
I
see
her,
though,
very
plainly
before
me
a
large
woman
of
the
gravest
aspect,
care
on
her
front
and
on
her
shoulders,
but
not
overwhelming,
inevitable
care,
rather
the
sort
of
voluntary,
exemplary
cloud
and
burden
people
ever
carry
who
deem
it
their
duty
to
be
gloomy.
Ah,
well
a
day!
Mrs.
Yorke
had
that
notion,
and
grave
as
Saturn
she
was,
morning,
noon,
and,
night;
and
hard
things
she
thought
if
any
unhappy
wight
especially
of
the
female
sex
who
dared
in
her
presence
to
show
the
light
of
a
gay
heart
on
a
sunny
countenance.
In
her
estimation,
to
be
mirthful
was
to
be
profane,
to
be
cheerful
was
to
be
frivolous.
She
drew
no
distinctions.
Yet
she
was
a
very
good
wife,
a
very
careful
mother,
looked
after
her
children
unceasingly,
was
sincerely
attached
to
her
husband;
only
the
worst
of
it
was,
if
she
could
have
had
her
will,
she
would
not
have
permitted
him
to
have
any
friend
in
the
world
beside
herself.
All
his
relations
were
insupportable
to
her,
and
she
kept
them
at
arm's
length.
Mr.
Yorke
and
