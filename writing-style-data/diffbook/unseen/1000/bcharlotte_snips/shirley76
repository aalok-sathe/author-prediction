nobody
else
had:
she
was
still
such
a
stay,
such
a
counsellor,
so
truthful,
so
kind
in
her
way,
that,
in
Caroline's
idea,
none
once
accustomed
to
her
presence
could
easily
afford
to
dispense
with
it.
As
to
dependency
or
humiliation,
Caroline
did
not
feel
it
in
her
intercourse
with
Shirley,
and
why
should
Mrs.
Pryor?
The
heiress
was
rich
very
rich
compared
with
her
new
friend:
one
possessed
a
clear
thousand
a
year,
the
other
not
a
penny;
and
yet
there
was
a
safe
sense
of
equality
experienced
in
her
society,
never
known
in
that
of
the
ordinary
Briarfield
and
Whinbury
gentry.
The
reason
was,
Shirley's
head
ran
on
other
things
than
money
and
position.
She
was
glad
to
be
independent
as
to
property;
by
fits
she
was
even
elated
at
the
notion
of
being
lady
of
the
manor,
and
having
tenants
and
an
estate.
She
was
especially
tickled
with
an
agreeable
complacency
when
reminded
of
"all
that
property"
down
in
the
Hollow,
"comprising
an
excellent
cloth
mill,
dyehouse,
warehouse,
together
with
the
messuage,
gardens,
and
outbuildings,
termed
Hollow's
Cottage;"
but
her
exultation
being
quite
undisguised
was
singularly
inoffensive;
and,
for
her
serious
thoughts,
they
tended
elsewhere.
To
admire
the
great,
reverence
the
good,
and
be
joyous
with
the
genial,
was
very
much
the
bent
of
Shirley's
soul:
she
mused,
therefore,
on
the
means
of
following
this
bent
far
oftener
than
she
pondered
on
her
social
superiority.
In
Caroline
Miss
Keeldar
had
first
taken
an
interest
because
she
was
quiet,
retiring,
looked
delicate,
and
seemed
as
if
she
needed
some
one
to
take
care
of
her.
Her
predilection
increased
greatly
when
she
discovered
that
her
own
way
of
thinking
and
talking
was
understood
and
responded
to
by
this
new
acquaintance.
She
had
hardly
expected
it.
Miss
Helstone,
she
fancied,
had
too
pretty
a
face,
manners
and
voice
too
soft,
to
be
anything
out
of
the
common
way
in
mind
and
attainments;
and
she
very
much
wondered
to
see
the
gentle
features
light
up
archly
to
the
reveille
of
a
dry
sally
or
two
risked
by
herself;
and
more
did
she
wonder
to
discover
the
self
won
knowledge
treasured,
and
the
untaught
speculations
working
in
that
girlish,
curl
veiled
head.
Caroline's
instinct
of
taste,
too,
was
like
her
own.
Such
books
as
Miss
Keeldar
had
read
with
the
most
pleasure
were
Miss
Helstone's
delight
also.
They
held
many
aversions
too
in
common,
and
could
have
the
comfort
of
laughing
together
over
works
of
false
sentimentality
and
pompous
pretension.
Few,
Shirley
conceived,
men
or
women
have
the
right
taste
in
poetry,
the
right
sense
for
discriminating
between
what
is
real
and
what
is
false.
She
had
again
and
again
heard
very
clever
people
pronounce
this
or
that
passage,
in
this
or
that
versifier,
altogether
admirable,
which,
when
she
read,
her
soul
refused
to
acknowledge
as
anything
but
cant,
flourish,
and
tinsel,
or
at
the
best
elaborate
wordiness,
curious,
clever,
learned,
perhaps,
haply
even
tinged
with
the
fascinating
hues
of
fancy,
but,
God
knows,
as
different
from
real
poetry
as
the
gorgeous
and
massy
vase
of
mosaic
is
from
the
little
cup
of
pure
metal;
or,
to
give
the
reader
a
choice
of
similes,
as
the
milliner's
artificial
wreath
is
from
the
fresh
gathered
lily
of
the
field.
Caroline,
she
found,
felt
the
value
of
the
true
ore,
and
knew
the
deception
of
the
flashy
dross.
The
minds
of
the
two
girls
being
toned
in
harmony
often
chimed
very
sweetly
together.
One
evening
they
chanced
to
be
alone
in
the
oak
parlour.
They
had
passed
a
long
wet
day
together
without
ennui.
It
was
now
on
the
edge
of
dark;
candles
were
not
yet
brought
in;
both,
as
twilight
deepened,
grew
meditative
and
silent.
A
western
wind
roared
high
round
the
hall,
driving
wild
clouds
and
stormy
rain
up
from
the
far
remote
ocean;
all
was
tempest
outside
the
antique
lattices,
all
deep
peace
within.
Shirley
sat
at
the
window,
watching
the
rack
in
heaven,
the
mist
on
earth,
listening
to
certain
notes
of
the
gale
that
plained
like
restless
spirits
notes
which,
had
she
not
been
so
young,
gay,
and
healthy,
would
have
swept
her
trembling
nerves
like
some
omen,
some
anticipatory
dirge.
In
this
her
prime
of
existence
and
bloom
of
beauty
they
but
subdued
vivacity
to
pensiveness.
Snatches
of
sweet
ballads
haunted
her
ear;
now
and
then
she
sang
a
stanza.
Her
accents
obeyed
the
fitful
impulse
of
the
wind;
they
swelled
as
its
gusts
rushed
on,
and
died
as
they
wandered
away.
Caroline,
withdrawn
to
the
farthest
and
darkest
end
of
the
room,
her
figure
just
discernible
by
the
ruby
shine
of
the
flameless
fire,
was
pacing
to
and
fro,
muttering
to
herself
fragments
of
well
remembered
poetry.
She
spoke
very
low,
but
Shirley
heard
her;
and
while
singing
softly,
she
listened.
This
was
the
strain:
"Obscurest
night
involved
the
sky,
The
Atlantic
billows
roared,
When
such
a
destined
wretch
as
I,
Washed
headlong
from
on
board,
Of
friends,
of
hope,
of
all
bereft,
His
floating
home
for
ever
left."
Here
the
fragment
stopped,
because
Shirley's
song,
erewhile
somewhat
full
and
thrilling,
had
become
delicately
faint.
"Go
on,"
said
she.
"Then
you
go
on
too.
I
was
only
repeating
'The
Castaway.'"
"I
know.
If
you
can
remember
it
all,
say
it
all."
And
as
it
was
nearly
dark,
and,
after
all,
Miss
Keeldar
was
no
formidable
auditor,
Caroline
went
through
it.
She
went
through
it
as
she
should
have
gone
through
it.
The
wild
sea,
the
drowning
mariner,
the
reluctant
ship
swept
on
in
the
storm,
you
heard
were
realized
by
her;
and
more
vividly
was
realized
the
heart
of
the
poet,
who
did
not
weep
for
"The
Castaway,"
but
who,
in
an
hour
of
tearless
anguish,
traced
a
semblance
to
his
own
God
abandoned
misery
in
the
fate
of
that
man
forsaken
sailor,
and
cried
from
the
depths
where
he
struggled,
"No
voice
divine
the
storm
allayed,
No
light
propitious
shone,
When,
snatched
from
all
effectual
aid,
