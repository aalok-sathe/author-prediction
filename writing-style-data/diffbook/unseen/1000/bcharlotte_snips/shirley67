of
spring,
it
may
also
brave
the
first
of
winter.
Every
one
noticed
the
change
in
Miss
Helstone's
appearance,
and
most
people
said
she
was
going
to
die.
She
never
thought
so
herself.
She
felt
in
no
dying
case;
she
had
neither
pain
nor
sickness.
Her
appetite
was
diminished;
she
knew
the
reason.
It
was
because
she
wept
so
much
at
night.
Her
strength
was
lessened;
she
could
account
for
it.
Sleep
was
coy
and
hard
to
be
won;
dreams
were
distressing
and
baleful.
In
the
far
future
she
still
seemed
to
anticipate
a
time
when
this
passage
of
misery
should
be
got
over,
and
when
she
should
once
more
be
calm,
though
perhaps
never
again
happy.
Meanwhile
her
uncle
urged
her
to
visit,
to
comply
with
the
frequent
invitations
of
their
acquaintance.
This
she
evaded
doing.
She
could
not
be
cheerful
in
company;
she
felt
she
was
observed
there
with
more
curiosity
than
sympathy.
Old
ladies
were
always
offering
her
their
advice,
recommending
this
or
that
nostrum;
young
ladies
looked
at
her
in
a
way
she
understood,
and
from
which
she
shrank.
Their
eyes
said
they
knew
she
had
been
"disappointed,"
as
custom
phrases
it;
by
whom,
they
were
not
certain.
Commonplace
young
ladies
can
be
quite
as
hard
as
commonplace
young
gentlemen
quite
as
worldly
and
selfish.
Those
who
suffer
should
always
avoid
them.
Grief
and
calamity
they
despise;
they
seem
to
regard
them
as
the
judgments
of
God
on
the
lowly.
With
them,
to
"love"
is
merely
to
contrive
a
scheme
for
achieving
a
good
match;
to
be
"disappointed"
is
to
have
their
scheme
seen
through
and
frustrated.
They
think
the
feelings
and
projects
of
others
on
the
subject
of
love
similar
to
their
own,
and
judge
them
accordingly.
All
this
Caroline
knew,
partly
by
instinct,
partly
by
observation.
She
regulated
her
conduct
by
her
knowledge,
keeping
her
pale
face
and
wasted
figure
as
much
out
of
sight
as
she
could.
Living
thus
in
complete
seclusion,
she
ceased
to
receive
intelligence
of
the
little
transactions
of
the
neighbourhood.
One
morning
her
uncle
came
into
the
parlour,
where
she
sat
endeavouring
to
find
some
pleasure
in
painting
a
little
group
of
wild
flowers,
gathered
under
a
hedge
at
the
top
of
the
Hollow
fields,
and
said
to
her
in
his
abrupt
manner,
"Come,
child,
you
are
always
stooping
over
palette,
or
book,
or
sampler;
leave
that
tinting
work.
By
the
bye,
do
you
put
your
pencil
to
your
lips
when
you
paint?"
"Sometimes,
uncle,
when
I
forget."
"Then
it
is
that
which
is
poisoning
you.
The
paints
are
deleterious,
child.
There
is
white
lead
and
red
lead,
and
verdigris,
and
gamboge,
and
twenty
other
poisons
in
those
colour
cakes.
Lock
them
up!
lock
them
up!
Get
your
bonnet
on.
I
want
you
to
make
a
call
with
me."
"With
you,
uncle?"
This
question
was
asked
in
a
tone
of
surprise.
She
was
not
accustomed
to
make
calls
with
her
uncle.
She
never
rode
or
walked
out
with
him
on
any
occasion.
"Quick!
quick!
I
am
always
busy,
you
know.
I
have
no
time
to
lose."
She
hurriedly
gathered
up
her
materials,
asking,
meantime,
where
they
were
going.
"To
Fieldhead."
"Fieldhead!
What!
to
see
old
James
Booth,
the
gardener?
Is
he
ill?"
"We
are
going
to
see
Miss
Shirley
Keeldar."
"Miss
Keeldar!
Is
she
coming
to
Yorkshire?
Is
she
at
Fieldhead?"
"She
is.
She
has
been
there
a
week.
I
met
her
at
a
party
last
night
that
party
to
which
you
would
not
go.
I
was
pleased
with
her.
I
choose
that
you
shall
make
her
acquaintance.
It
will
do
you
good."
"She
is
now
come
of
age,
I
suppose?"
"She
is
come
of
age,
and
will
reside
for
a
time
on
her
property.
I
lectured
her
on
the
subject;
I
showed
her
her
duty.
She
is
not
intractable.
She
is
rather
a
fine
girl;
she
will
teach
you
what
it
is
to
have
a
sprightly
spirit.
Nothing
lackadaisical
about
her."
"I
don't
think
she
will
want
to
see
me,
or
to
have
me
introduced
to
her.
What
good
can
I
do
her?
How
can
I
amuse
her?"
"Pshaw!
Put
your
bonnet
on."
"Is
she
proud,
uncle?"
"Don't
know.
You
hardly
imagine
she
would
show
her
pride
to
me,
I
suppose?
A
chit
like
that
would
scarcely
presume
to
give
herself
airs
with
the
rector
of
her
parish,
however
rich
she
might
be."
"No.
But
how
did
she
behave
to
other
people?"
"Didn't
observe.
She
holds
her
head
high,
and
probably
can
be
saucy
enough
where
she
dare.
She
wouldn't
be
a
woman
otherwise.
There!
Away
now
for
your
bonnet
at
once!"
Not
naturally
very
confident,
a
failure
of
physical
strength
and
a
depression
of
spirits
had
not
tended
to
increase
Caroline's
presence
of
mind
and
ease
of
manner,
or
to
give
her
additional
courage
to
face
strangers,
and
she
quailed,
in
spite
of
self
remonstrance,
as
she
and
her
uncle
walked
up
the
broad,
paved
approach
leading
from
the
gateway
of
Fieldhead
to
its
porch.
She
followed
Mr.
Helstone
reluctantly
through
that
porch
into
the
sombre
old
vestibule
beyond.
Very
sombre
it
was
long,
vast,
and
dark;
one
latticed
window
lit
it
but
dimly.
The
wide
old
chimney
contained
now
no
fire,
for
the
present
warm
weather
needed
it
not;
it
was
filled
instead
with
willow
boughs.
The
gallery
on
high,
opposite
the
entrance,
was
seen
but
in
outline,
so
shadowy
became
this
hall
towards
its
ceiling.
Carved
stags'
heads,
with
real
antlers,
looked
down
grotesquely
from
the
walls.
This
was
neither
a
grand
nor
a
comfortable
house;
within
as
without
it
was
antique,
rambling,
and
incommodious.
A
property
of
a
thousand
a
year
belonged
to
it,
which
property
had
descended,
for
lack
of
male
heirs,
on
a
female.
There
were
mercantile
families
in
the
district
boasting
twice
the
income,
but
the
Keeldars,
by
virtue
of
their
antiquity,
and
their
distinction
of
lords
of
the
manor,
took
the
precedence
of
all.
Mr.
and
Miss
Helstone
were
ushered
