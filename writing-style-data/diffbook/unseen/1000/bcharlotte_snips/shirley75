male
portraits.
"That
is
a
beautiful
face,"
said
Mrs.
Pryor,
interrupting
a
brief
pause
which
had
followed
half
an
hour's
animated
conversation.
"The
features
may
be
termed
perfect;
no
statuary's
chisel
could
improve
them.
It
is
a
portrait
from
the
life,
I
presume?"
"It
is
a
portrait
of
Mrs.
Helstone."
"Of
Mrs.
Matthewson
Helstone?
Of
your
uncle's
wife?"
"It
is,
and
is
said
to
be
a
good
likeness.
Before
her
marriage
she
was
accounted
the
beauty
of
the
district."
"I
should
say
she
merited
the
distinction.
What
accuracy
in
all
the
lineaments!
It
is,
however,
a
passive
face.
The
original
could
not
have
been
what
is
generally
termed
'a
woman
of
spirit.'"
"I
believe
she
was
a
remarkably
still,
silent
person."
"One
would
scarcely
have
expected,
my
dear,
that
your
uncle's
choice
should
have
fallen
on
a
partner
of
that
description.
Is
he
not
fond
of
being
amused
by
lively
chat?"
"In
company
he
is.
But
he
always
says
he
could
never
do
with
a
talking
wife.
He
must
have
quiet
at
home.
You
go
out
to
gossip,
he
affirms;
you
come
home
to
read
and
reflect."
"Mrs.
Matthewson
lived
but
a
few
years
after
her
marriage,
I
think
I
have
heard?"
"About
five
years."
"Well,
my
dear,"
pursued
Mrs.
Pryor,
rising
to
go,
"I
trust
it
is
understood
that
you
will
frequently
come
to
Fieldhead.
I
hope
you
will.
You
must
feel
lonely
here,
having
no
female
relative
in
the
house;
you
must
necessarily
pass
much
of
your
time
in
solitude."
"I
am
inured
to
it.
I
have
grown
up
by
myself.
May
I
arrange
your
shawl
for
you?"
Mrs.
Pryor
submitted
to
be
assisted.
"Should
you
chance
to
require
help
in
your
studies,"
she
said,
"you
may
command
me."
Caroline
expressed
her
sense
of
such
kindness.
"I
hope
to
have
frequent
conversations
with
you.
I
should
wish
to
be
of
use
to
you."
Again
Miss
Helstone
returned
thanks.
She
thought
what
a
kind
heart
was
hidden
under
her
visitor's
seeming
chilliness.
Observing
that
Mrs.
Pryor
again
glanced
with
an
air
of
interest
towards
the
portraits,
as
she
walked
down
the
room,
Caroline
casually
explained:
"The
likeness
that
hangs
near
the
window,
you
will
see,
is
my
uncle,
taken
twenty
years
ago;
the
other,
to
the
left
of
the
mantelpiece,
is
his
brother
James,
my
father."
"They
resemble
each
other
in
some
measure,"
said
Mrs.
Pryor;
"yet
a
difference
of
character
may
be
traced
in
the
different
mould
of
the
brow
and
mouth."
"What
difference?"
inquired
Caroline,
accompanying
her
to
the
door.
"James
Helstone
that
is,
my
father
is
generally
considered
the
best
looking
of
the
two.
Strangers,
I
remark,
always
exclaim,
'What
a
handsome
man!'
Do
you
think
his
picture
handsome,
Mrs.
Pryor?"
"It
is
much
softer
or
finer
featured
than
that
of
your
uncle."
"But
where
or
what
is
the
difference
of
character
to
which
you
alluded?
Tell
me.
I
wish
to
see
if
you
guess
right."
"My
dear,
your
uncle
is
a
man
of
principle.
His
forehead
and
his
lips
are
firm,
and
his
eye
is
steady."
"Well,
and
the
other?
Do
not
be
afraid
of
offending
me.
I
always
like
the
truth."
"Do
you
like
the
truth?
It
is
well
for
you.
Adhere
to
that
preference
never
swerve
thence.
The
other,
my
dear,
if
he
had
been
living
now,
would
probably
have
furnished
little
support
to
his
daughter.
It
is,
however,
a
graceful
head
taken
in
youth,
I
should
think.
My
dear"
(turning
abruptly),
"you
acknowledge
an
inestimable
value
in
principle?"
"I
am
sure
no
character
can
have
true
worth
without
it."
"You
feel
what
you
say?
You
have
considered
the
subject?"
"Often.
Circumstances
early
forced
it
upon
my
attention."
"The
lesson
was
not
lost,
then,
though
it
came
so
prematurely.
I
suppose
the
soil
is
not
light
nor
stony,
otherwise
seed
falling
in
that
season
never
would
have
borne
fruit.
My
dear,
do
not
stand
in
the
air
of
the
door;
you
will
take
cold.
Good
afternoon."
Miss
Helstone's
new
acquaintance
soon
became
of
value
to
her:
their
society
was
acknowledged
a
privilege.
She
found
she
would
have
been
in
error
indeed
to
have
let
slip
this
chance
of
relief,
to
have
neglected
to
avail
herself
of
this
happy
change.
A
turn
was
thereby
given
to
her
thoughts;
a
new
channel
was
opened
for
them,
which,
diverting
a
few
of
them
at
least
from
the
one
direction
in
which
all
had
hitherto
tended,
abated
the
impetuosity
of
their
rush,
and
lessened
the
force
of
their
pressure
on
one
worn
down
point.
Soon
she
was
content
to
spend
whole
days
at
Fieldhead,
doing
by
turns
whatever
Shirley
or
Mrs.
Pryor
wished
her
to
do;
and
now
one
would
claim
her,
now
the
other.
Nothing
could
be
less
demonstrative
than
the
friendship
of
the
elder
lady,
but
also
nothing
could
be
more
vigilant,
assiduous,
untiring.
I
have
intimated
that
she
was
a
peculiar
personage,
and
in
nothing
was
her
peculiarity
more
shown
than
in
the
nature
of
the
interest
she
evinced
for
Caroline.
She
watched
all
her
movements;
she
seemed
as
if
she
would
have
guarded
all
her
steps.
It
gave
her
pleasure
to
be
applied
to
by
Miss
Helstone
for
advice
and
assistance.
She
yielded
her
aid,
when
asked,
with
such
quiet
yet
obvious
enjoyment
that
Caroline
ere
long
took
delight
in
depending
on
her.
Shirley
Keeldar's
complete
docility
with
Mrs.
Pryor
had
at
first
surprised
Miss
Helstone,
and
not
less
the
fact
of
the
reserved
ex
governess
being
so
much
at
home
and
at
ease
in
the
residence
of
her
young
pupil,
where
she
filled
with
such
quiet
independency
a
very
dependent
post;
but
she
soon
found
that
it
needed
but
to
know
both
ladies
to
comprehend
fully
the
enigma.
Every
one,
it
seemed
to
her,
must
like,
must
love,
must
prize
Mrs.
Pryor
when
they
knew
her.
No
matter
that
she
perseveringly
wore
old
fashioned
gowns;
that
her
speech
was
formal
and
her
manner
cool;
that
she
had
twenty
little
ways
such
as
