will
gabble
when
the
curates
come
in,
and
how
weary
I
shall
grow
with
listening
to
them!
But
I
suppose
I
am
a
selfish
fool.
These
are
very
respectable
gentlefolks.
I
ought,
no
doubt,
to
be
proud
of
their
countenance.
I
don't
say
they
are
not
as
good
as
I
am
far
from
it
but
they
are
different
from
me."
She
went
in.
Yorkshire
people
in
those
days
took
their
tea
round
the
table,
sitting
well
into
it,
with
their
knees
duly
introduced
under
the
mahogany.
It
was
essential
to
have
a
multitude
of
plates
of
bread
and
butter,
varied
in
sorts
and
plentiful
in
quantity.
It
was
thought
proper,
too,
that
on
the
centre
plate
should
stand
a
glass
dish
of
marmalade.
Among
the
viands
was
expected
to
be
found
a
small
assortment
of
cheesecakes
and
tarts.
If
there
was
also
a
plate
of
thin
slices
of
pink
ham
garnished
with
green
parsley,
so
much
the
better.
Eliza,
the
rector's
cook,
fortunately
knew
her
business
as
provider.
She
had
been
put
out
of
humour
a
little
at
first,
when
the
invaders
came
so
unexpectedly
in
such
strength;
but
it
appeared
that
she
regained
her
cheerfulness
with
action,
for
in
due
time
the
tea
was
spread
forth
in
handsome
style,
and
neither
ham,
tarts,
nor
marmalade
were
wanting
among
its
accompaniments.
The
curates,
summoned
to
this
bounteous
repast,
entered
joyous;
but
at
once,
on
seeing
the
ladies,
of
whose
presence
they
had
not
been
forewarned,
they
came
to
a
stand
in
the
doorway.
Malone
headed
the
party;
he
stopped
short
and
fell
back,
almost
capsizing
Donne,
who
was
behind
him.
Donne,
staggering
three
paces
in
retreat,
sent
little
Sweeting
into
the
arms
of
old
Helstone,
who
brought
up
the
rear.
There
was
some
expostulation,
some
tittering.
Malone
was
desired
to
mind
what
he
was
about,
and
urged
to
push
forward,
which
at
last
he
did,
though
colouring
to
the
top
of
his
peaked
forehead
a
bluish
purple.
Helstone,
advancing,
set
the
shy
curates
aside,
welcomed
all
his
fair
guests,
shook
hands
and
passed
a
jest
with
each,
and
seated
himself
snugly
between
the
lovely
Harriet
and
the
dashing
Hannah.
Miss
Mary
he
requested
to
move
to
the
seat
opposite
to
him,
that
he
might
see
her
if
he
couldn't
be
near
her.
Perfectly
easy
and
gallant,
in
his
way,
were
his
manners
always
to
young
ladies,
and
most
popular
was
he
amongst
them;
yet
at
heart
he
neither
respected
nor
liked
the
sex,
and
such
of
them
as
circumstances
had
brought
into
intimate
relation
with
him
had
ever
feared
rather
than
loved
him.
The
curates
were
left
to
shift
for
themselves.
Sweeting,
who
was
the
least
embarrassed
of
the
three,
took
refuge
beside
Mrs.
Sykes,
who,
he
knew,
was
almost
as
fond
of
him
as
if
he
had
been
her
son.
Donne,
after
making
his
general
bow
with
a
grace
all
his
own,
and
saying
in
a
high,
pragmatical
voice,
"How
d'ye
do,
Miss
Helstone?"
dropped
into
a
seat
at
Caroline's
elbow,
to
her
unmitigated
annoyance,
for
she
had
a
peculiar
antipathy
to
Donne,
on
account
of
his
stultified
and
immovable
self
conceit
and
his
incurable
narrowness
of
mind.
Malone,
grinning
most
unmeaningly,
inducted
himself
into
the
corresponding
seat
on
the
other
side.
She
was
thus
blessed
in
a
pair
of
supporters,
neither
of
whom,
she
knew,
would
be
of
any
mortal
use,
whether
for
keeping
up
the
conversation,
handing
cups,
circulating
the
muffins,
or
even
lifting
the
plate
from
the
slop
basin.
Little
Sweeting,
small
and
boyish
as
he
was,
would
have
been
worth
twenty
of
them.
Malone,
though
a
ceaseless
talker
when
there
were
only
men
present,
was
usually
tongue
tied
in
the
presence
of
ladies.
Three
phrases,
however,
he
had
ready
cut
and
dried,
which
he
never
failed
to
produce:
1stly.
"Have
you
had
a
walk
to
day,
Miss
Helstone?"
2ndly.
"Have
you
seen
your
cousin
Moore
lately?"
3rdly.
"Does
your
class
at
the
Sunday
school
keep
up
its
number?"
These
three
questions
being
put
and
responded
to,
between
Caroline
and
Malone
reigned
silence.
With
Donne
it
was
otherwise;
he
was
troublesome,
exasperating.
He
had
a
stock
of
small
talk
on
hand,
at
once
the
most
trite
and
perverse
that
can
well
be
imagined
abuse
of
the
people
of
Briarfield;
of
the
natives
of
Yorkshire
generally;
complaints
of
the
want
of
high
society;
of
the
backward
state
of
civilization
in
these
districts;
murmurings
against
the
disrespectful
conduct
of
the
lower
orders
in
the
north
toward
their
betters;
silly
ridicule
of
the
manner
of
living
in
these
parts
the
want
of
style,
the
absence
of
elegance,
as
if
he,
Donne,
had
been
accustomed
to
very
great
doings
indeed,
an
insinuation
which
his
somewhat
underbred
manner
and
aspect
failed
to
bear
out.
These
strictures,
he
seemed
to
think,
must
raise
him
in
the
estimation
of
Miss
Helstone
or
of
any
other
lady
who
heard
him;
whereas
with
her,
at
least,
they
brought
him
to
a
level
below
contempt,
though
sometimes,
indeed,
they
incensed
her;
for,
a
Yorkshire
girl
herself,
she
hated
to
hear
Yorkshire
abused
by
such
a
pitiful
prater;
and
when
wrought
up
to
a
certain
pitch,
she
would
turn
and
say
something
of
which
neither
the
matter
nor
the
manner
recommended
her
to
Mr.
Donne's
good
will.
She
would
tell
him
it
was
no
proof
of
refinement
to
be
ever
scolding
others
for
vulgarity,
and
no
sign
of
a
good
pastor
to
be
eternally
censuring
his
flock.
She
would
ask
him
what
he
had
entered
the
church
for,
since
he
complained
there
were
only
cottages
to
visit,
and
poor
people
to
preach
to
whether
he
had
been
ordained
to
the
ministry
merely
to
wear
soft
clothing
and
sit
in
king's
houses.
These
questions
were
considered
by
all
the
curates
as,
to
the
last
degree,
audacious
and
impious.
Tea
was
a
long
time
in
progress;
all
the
guests
gabbled
as
their
hostess
had
expected
they
would.
Mr.
Helstone,
being
in
excellent
spirits
when,
indeed,
was
he
ever
otherwise
