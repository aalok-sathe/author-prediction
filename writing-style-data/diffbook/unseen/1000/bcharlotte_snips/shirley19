Yorke
that
blasphemy
against
God
and
the
king
was
a
deadly
sin,
and
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
'judgment
to
come.'"
Mr.
Yorke
"believed
fully
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
judgment
to
come.
If
it
were
otherwise,
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
how
all
the
scoundrels
who
seemed
triumphant
in
this
world,
who
broke
innocent
hearts
with
impunity,
abused
unmerited
privileges,
were
a
scandal
to
honourable
callings,
took
the
bread
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
poor,
browbeat
the
humble,
and
truckled
meanly
to
the
rich
and
proud,
were
to
be
properly
paid
off
in
such
coin
as
they
had
earned.
But,"
he
added,
"whenever
he
got
low
spirited
about
such
like
goings
on,
and
their
seeming
success
in
this
mucky
lump
of
a
planet,
he
just
reached
down
t'
owd
book"
(pointing
to
a
great
Bible
in
the
bookcase),
"opened
it
like
at
a
chance,
and
he
was
sure
to
light
of
a
verse
blazing
wi'
a
blue
brimstone
low
that
set
all
straight.
He
knew,"
he
said,
"where
some
folk
war
bound
for,
just
as
weel
as
if
an
angel
wi'
great
white
wings
had
come
in
ower
t'
door
stone
and
told
him."
"Sir,"
said
Mr.
Helstone,
collecting
all
his
dignity
"sir,
the
great
knowledge
of
man
is
to
know
himself,
and
the
bourne
whither
his
own
steps
tend."
"Ay,
ay.
You'll
recollect,
Mr.
Helstone,
that
Ignorance
was
carried
away
from
the
very
gates
of
heaven,
borne
through
the
air,
and
thrust
in
at
a
door
in
the
side
of
the
hill
which
led
down
to
hell."
"Nor
have
I
forgotten,
Mr.
Yorke,
that
Vain
Confidence,
not
seeing
the
way
before
him,
fell
into
a
deep
pit,
which
was
on
purpose
there
made
by
the
prince
of
the
grounds,
to
catch
vainglorious
fools
withal,
and
was
dashed
to
pieces
with
his
fall."
"Now,"
interposed
Mr.
Moore,
who
had
hitherto
sat
a
silent
but
amused
spectator
of
this
worldly
combat,
and
whose
indifference
to
the
party
politics
of
the
day,
as
well
as
to
the
gossip
of
the
neighbourhood,
made
him
an
impartial,
if
apathetic,
judge
of
the
merits
of
such
an
encounter,
"you
have
both
sufficiently
blackballed
each
other,
and
proved
how
cordially
you
detest
each
other,
and
how
wicked
you
think
each
other.
For
my
part,
my
hate
is
still
running
in
such
a
strong
current
against
the
fellows
who
have
broken
my
frames
that
I
have
none
to
spare
for
my
private
acquaintance,
and
still
less
for
such
a
vague
thing
as
a
sect
or
a
government.
But
really,
gentlemen,
you
both
seem
very
bad
by
your
own
showing
worse
than
ever
I
suspected
you
to
be.
I
dare
not
stay
all
night
with
a
rebel
and
blasphemer
like
you,
Yorke;
and
I
hardly
dare
ride
home
with
a
cruel
and
tyrannical
ecclesiastic
like
Mr.
Helstone."
"I
am
going,
however,
Mr.
Moore,"
said
the
rector
sternly.
"Come
with
me
or
not,
as
you
please."
"Nay,
he
shall
not
have
the
choice;
he
shall
go
with
you,"
responded
Yorke.
"It's
midnight,
and
past;
and
I'll
have
nob'dy
staying
up
i'
my
house
any
longer.
Ye
mun
all
go."
He
rang
the
bell.
"Deb,"
said
he
to
the
servant
who
answered
it,
"clear
them
folk
out
o'
t'
kitchen,
and
lock
t'
doors,
and
be
off
to
bed.
Here
is
your
way,
gentlemen,"
he
continued
to
his
guests;
and,
lighting
them
through
the
passage,
he
fairly
put
them
out
at
his
front
door.
They
met
their
party
hurrying
out
pell
mell
by
the
back
way.
Their
horses
stood
at
the
gate;
they
mounted,
and
rode
off,
Moore
laughing
at
their
abrupt
dismissal,
Helstone
deeply
indignant
thereat.
Moore's
good
spirits
were
still
with
him
when
he
rose
next
morning.
He
and
Joe
Scott
had
both
spent
the
night
in
the
mill,
availing
themselves
of
certain
sleeping
accommodations
producible
from
recesses
in
the
front
and
back
counting
houses.
The
master,
always
an
early
riser,
was
up
somewhat
sooner
even
than
usual.
He
awoke
his
man
by
singing
a
French
song
as
he
made
his
toilet.
"Ye're
not
custen
dahn,
then,
maister?"
cried
Joe.
"Not
a
stiver,
mon
garcon
which
means,
my
lad.
Get
up,
and
we'll
take
a
turn
through
the
mill
before
the
hands
come
in,
and
I'll
explain
my
future
plans.
We'll
have
the
machinery
yet,
Joseph.
You
never
heard
of
Bruce,
perhaps?"
"And
th'
arrand
(spider)?
Yes,
but
I
hev.
I've
read
th'
history
o'
Scotland,
and
happen
knaw
as
mich
on't
as
ye;
and
I
understand
ye
to
mean
to
say
ye'll
persevere."
"I
do."
"Is
there
mony
o'
your
mak'
i'
your
country?"
inquired
Joe,
as
he
folded
up
his
temporary
bed,
and
put
it
away.
"In
my
country!
Which
is
my
country?"
"Why,
France
isn't
it?"
"Not
it,
indeed!
The
circumstance
of
the
French
having
seized
Antwerp,
where
I
was
born,
does
not
make
me
a
Frenchman."
"Holland,
then?"
"I
am
not
a
Dutchman.
Now
you
are
confounding
Antwerp
with
Amsterdam."
"Flanders?"
"I
scorn
the
insinuation,
Joe!
I
a
Flamand!
Have
I
a
Flemish
face
the
clumsy
nose
standing
out,
the
mean
forehead
falling
back,
the
pale
blue
eyes
'a
fleur
de
tete'?
Am
I
all
body
and
no
legs,
like
a
Flamand?
But
you
don't
know
what
they
are
like,
those
Netherlanders.
Joe,
I'm
an
Anversois.
My
mother
was
an
Anversoise,
though
she
came
of
French
lineage,
which
is
the
reason
I
speak
French."
"But
your
father
war
Yorkshire,
which
maks
ye
a
bit
Yorkshire
too;
and
onybody
may
see
ye're
akin
to
us,
ye're
so
keen
o'
making
brass,
and
getting
forrards."
"Joe,
you're
an
impudent
dog;
but
I've
always
been
accustomed
to
a
boorish
sort
of
insolence
from
my
youth
up.
The
'classe
ouvriere'
that
is,
the
working
people
in
Belgium
bear
themselves
brutally
towards
their
employers;
and
by
brutally,
Joe,
I
mean
brutalement
which,
perhaps,
when
properly
translated,
should
be
roughly."
"We
allus
speak
our
minds
i'
this
country;
and
them
young
parsons
and
