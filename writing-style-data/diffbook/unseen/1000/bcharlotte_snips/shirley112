their
disgrace,
not
his.
Mr.
Moore
himself
hates
nobody.
He
only
wants
to
do
his
duty,
and
maintain
his
rights.
You
are
wrong
to
talk
so."
"I
talk
as
I
think.
He
has
a
cold,
unfeeling
heart,
yond'
Moore."
"But,"
interposed
Shirley,
"supposing
Moore
was
driven
from
the
country,
and
his
mill
razed
to
the
ground,
would
people
have
more
work?"
"They'd
have
less.
I
know
that,
and
they
know
that;
and
there
is
many
an
honest
lad
driven
desperate
by
the
certainty
that
whichever
way
he
turns
he
cannot
better
himself;
and
there
is
dishonest
men
plenty
to
guide
them
to
the
devil,
scoundrels
that
reckons
to
be
the
'people's
friends,'
and
that
knows
nought
about
the
people,
and
is
as
insincere
as
Lucifer.
I've
lived
aboon
forty
year
in
the
world,
and
I
believe
that
'the
people'
will
never
have
any
true
friends
but
theirseln
and
them
two
or
three
good
folk
i'
different
stations
that
is
friends
to
all
the
world.
Human
natur',
taking
it
i'
th'
lump,
is
nought
but
selfishness.
It
is
but
excessive
few,
it
is
but
just
an
exception
here
and
there,
now
and
then,
sich
as
ye
two
young
uns
and
me,
that,
being
in
a
different
sphere,
can
understand
t'
one
t'
other,
and
be
friends
wi'out
slavishness
o'
one
hand
or
pride
o'
t'
other.
Them
that
reckons
to
be
friends
to
a
lower
class
than
their
own
fro'
political
motives
is
never
to
be
trusted;
they
always
try
to
make
their
inferiors
tools.
For
my
own
part,
I
will
neither
be
patronized
nor
misled
for
no
man's
pleasure.
I've
had
overtures
made
to
me
lately
that
I
saw
were
treacherous,
and
I
flung
'em
back
i'
the
faces
o'
them
that
offered
'em."
"You
won't
tell
us
what
overtures?"
"I
will
not.
It
would
do
no
good.
It
would
mak
no
difference.
Them
they
concerned
can
look
after
theirseln."
"Ay,
we'se
look
after
werseln,"
said
another
voice.
Joe
Scott
had
sauntered
forth
from
the
church
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air,
and
there
he
stood.
"I'll
warrant
ye,
Joe,"
observed
William,
smiling.
"And
I'll
warrant
my
maister,"
was
the
answer.
"Young
ladies,"
continued
Joe,
assuming
a
lordly
air,
"ye'd
better
go
into
th'
house."
"I
wonder
what
for?"
inquired
Shirley,
to
whom
the
overlooker's
somewhat
pragmatical
manners
were
familiar,
and
who
was
often
at
war
with
him;
for
Joe,
holding
supercilious
theories
about
women
in
general,
resented
greatly,
in
his
secret
soul,
the
fact
of
his
master
and
his
master's
mill
being,
in
a
manner,
under
petticoat
government,
and
had
felt
as
wormwood
and
gall
certain
business
visits
of
the
heiress
to
the
Hollow's
counting
house.
"Because
there
is
nought
agate
that
fits
women
to
be
consarned
in."
"Indeed!
There
is
prayer
and
preaching
agate
in
that
church.
Are
we
not
concerned
in
that?"
"Ye
have
been
present
neither
at
the
prayer
nor
preaching,
ma'am,
if
I
have
observed
aright.
What
I
alluded
to
was
politics.
William
Farren
here
was
touching
on
that
subject,
if
I'm
not
mista'en."
"Well,
what
then?
Politics
are
our
habitual
study,
Joe.
Do
you
know
I
see
a
newspaper
every
day,
and
two
of
a
Sunday?"
"I
should
think
you'll
read
the
marriages,
probably,
miss,
and
the
murders,
and
the
accidents,
and
sich
like?"
"I
read
the
leading
articles,
Joe,
and
the
foreign
intelligence,
and
I
look
over
the
market
prices.
In
short,
I
read
just
what
gentlemen
read."
Joe
looked
as
if
he
thought
this
talk
was
like
the
chattering
of
a
pie.
He
replied
to
it
by
a
disdainful
silence.
"Joe,"
continued
Miss
Keeldar,
"I
never
yet
could
ascertain
properly
whether
you
are
a
Whig
or
a
Tory.
Pray,
which
party
has
the
honour
of
your
alliance?"
"It
is
rayther
difficult
to
explain
where
you
are
sure
not
to
be
understood,"
was
Joe's
haughty
response;
"but
as
to
being
a
Tory,
I'd
as
soon
be
an
old
woman,
or
a
young
one,
which
is
a
more
flimsier
article
still.
It
is
the
Tories
that
carries
on
the
war
and
ruins
trade;
and
if
I
be
of
any
party
though
political
parties
is
all
nonsense
I'm
of
that
which
is
most
favourable
to
peace,
and,
by
consequence,
to
the
mercantile
interests
of
this
here
land."
"So
am
I,
Joe,"
replied
Shirley,
who
had
rather
a
pleasure
in
teasing
the
overlooker,
by
persisting
in
talking
on
subjects
with
which
he
opined
she,
as
a
woman,
had
no
right
to
meddle
"partly,
at
least.
I
have
rather
a
leaning
to
the
agricultural
interest,
too;
as
good
reason
is,
seeing
that
I
don't
desire
England
to
be
under
the
feet
of
France,
and
that
if
a
share
of
my
income
comes
from
Hollow's
Mill,
a
larger
share
comes
from
the
landed
estate
around
it.
It
would
not
do
to
take
any
measures
injurious
to
the
farmers,
Joe,
I
think?"
"The
dews
at
this
hour
is
unwholesome
for
females,"
observed
Joe.
"If
you
make
that
remark
out
of
interest
in
me,
I
have
merely
to
assure
you
that
I
am
impervious
to
cold.
I
should
not
mind
taking
my
turn
to
watch
the
mill
one
of
these
summer
nights,
armed
with
your
musket,
Joe."
Joe
Scott's
chin
was
always
rather
prominent.
He
poked
it
out,
at
this
speech,
some
inches
farther
than
usual.
"But
to
go
back
to
my
sheep,"
she
proceeded
"clothier
and
mill
owner
as
I
am,
besides
farmer,
I
cannot
get
out
of
my
head
a
certain
idea
that
we
manufacturers
and
persons
of
business
are
sometimes
a
little
a
very
little
selfish
and
short
sighted
in
our
views,
and
rather
too
regardless
of
human
suffering,
rather
heartless
in
our
pursuit
of
gain.
Don't
you
agree
with
me,
Joe?"
"I
cannot
argue
where
I
cannot
be
comprehended,"
was
again
the
answer.
"Man
of
mystery!
Your
master
will
argue
with
me
sometimes,
Joe.
He
is
not
so
stiff
as
you
are."
"Maybe
not.
We've
all
our
own
ways."
"Joe,
do
you
seriously
think
all
