the
baronet
to
a
point.
He
had
observed
that
Miss
Keeldar
looked
pensive
and
delicate.
This
new
phase
in
her
demeanour
smote
him
on
his
weak
or
poetic
side.
A
spontaneous
sonnet
brewed
in
his
brain;
and
while
it
was
still
working
there,
one
of
his
sisters
persuaded
his
lady
love
to
sit
down
to
the
piano
and
sing
a
ballad
one
of
Sir
Philip's
own
ballads.
It
was
the
least
elaborate,
the
least
affected
out
of
all
comparison
the
best
of
his
numerous
efforts.
It
chanced
that
Shirley,
the
moment
before,
had
been
gazing
from
a
window
down
on
the
park.
She
had
seen
that
stormy
moonlight
which
"le
Professeur
Louis"
was
perhaps
at
the
same
instant
contemplating
from
her
own
oak
parlour
lattice;
she
had
seen
the
isolated
trees
of
the
domain
broad,
strong,
spreading
oaks,
and
high
towering
heroic
beeches
wrestling
with
the
gale.
Her
ear
had
caught
the
full
roar
of
the
forest
lower
down;
the
swift
rushing
of
clouds,
the
moon,
to
the
eye,
hasting
swifter
still,
had
crossed
her
vision.
She
turned
from
sight
and
sound
touched,
if
not
rapt;
wakened,
if
not
inspired.
She
sang,
as
requested.
There
was
much
about
love
in
the
ballad
faithful
love
that
refused
to
abandon
its
object;
love
that
disaster
could
not
shake;
love
that
in
calamity
waxed
fonder,
in
poverty
clung
closer.
The
words
were
set
to
a
fine
old
air;
in
themselves
they
were
simple
and
sweet.
Perhaps,
when
read,
they
wanted
force;
when
well
sung,
they
wanted
nothing.
Shirley
sang
them
well.
She
breathed
into
the
feeling
softness;
she
poured
round
the
passion
force.
Her
voice
was
fine
that
evening,
its
expression
dramatic.
She
impressed
all,
and
charmed
one.
On
leaving
the
instrument
she
went
to
the
fire,
and
sat
down
on
a
seat
semi
stool,
semi
cushion.
The
ladies
were
round
her;
none
of
them
spoke.
The
Misses
Sympson
and
the
Misses
Nunnely
looked
upon
her
as
quiet
poultry
might
look
on
an
egret,
an
ibis,
or
any
other
strange
fowl.
What
made
her
sing
so?
They
never
sang
so.
Was
it
proper
to
sing
with
such
expression,
with
such
originality
so
unlike
a
school
girl?
Decidedly
not.
It
was
strange,
it
was
unusual.
What
was
strange
must
be
wrong;
what
was
unusual
must
be
improper.
Shirley
was
judged.
Moreover,
old
Lady
Nunnely
eyed
her
stonily
from
her
great
chair
by
the
fireside.
Her
gaze
said,
"This
woman
is
not
of
mine
or
my
daughters'
kind.
I
object
to
her
as
my
son's
wife."
Her
son,
catching
the
look,
read
its
meaning.
He
grew
alarmed.
What
he
so
wished
to
win
there
was
danger
he
might
lose.
He
must
make
haste.
The
room
they
were
in
had
once
been
a
picture
gallery.
Sir
Philip's
father
Sir
Monckton
had
converted
it
into
a
saloon;
but
still
it
had
a
shadowy,
long
withdrawing
look.
A
deep
recess
with
a
window
a
recess
that
held
one
couch,
one
table,
and
a
fairy
cabinet
formed
a
room
within
a
room.
Two
persons
standing
there
might
interchange
a
dialogue,
and,
so
it
were
neither
long
nor
loud,
none
be
the
wiser.
Sir
Philip
induced
two
of
his
sisters
to
perpetrate
a
duet.
He
gave
occupation
to
the
Misses
Sympson.
The
elder
ladies
were
conversing
together.
He
was
pleased
to
remark
that
meantime
Shirley
rose
to
look
at
the
pictures.
He
had
a
tale
to
tell
about
one
ancestress,
whose
dark
beauty
seemed
as
that
of
a
flower
of
the
south.
He
joined
her,
and
began
to
tell
it.
There
were
mementoes
of
the
same
lady
in
the
cabinet
adorning
the
recess;
and
while
Shirley
was
stooping
to
examine
the
missal
and
the
rosary
on
the
inlaid
shelf,
and
while
the
Misses
Nunnely
indulged
in
a
prolonged
screech,
guiltless
of
expression,
pure
of
originality,
perfectly
conventional
and
absolutely
unmeaning,
Sir
Philip
stooped
too,
and
whispered
a
few
hurried
sentences.
At
first
Miss
Keeldar
was
struck
so
still
you
might
have
fancied
that
whisper
a
charm
which
had
changed
her
to
a
statue;
but
she
presently
looked
up
and
answered.
They
parted.
Miss
Keeldar
returned
to
the
fire,
and
resumed
her
seat.
The
baronet
gazed
after
her,
then
went
and
stood
behind
his
sisters.
Mr.
Sympson
Mr.
Sympson
only
had
marked
the
pantomime.
That
gentleman
drew
his
own
conclusions.
Had
he
been
as
acute
as
he
was
meddling,
as
profound
as
he
was
prying,
he
might
have
found
that
in
Sir
Philip's
face
whereby
to
correct
his
inference.
Ever
shallow,
hasty,
and
positive,
he
went
home
quite
cock
a
hoop.
He
was
not
a
man
that
kept
secrets
well.
When
elate
on
a
subject,
he
could
not
avoid
talking
about
it.
The
next
morning,
having
occasion
to
employ
his
son's
tutor
as
his
secretary,
he
must
needs
announce
to
him,
in
mouthing
accents,
and
with
much
flimsy
pomp
of
manner,
that
he
had
better
hold
himself
prepared
for
a
return
to
the
south
at
an
early
day,
as
the
important
business
which
had
detained
him
(Mr.
Sympson)
so
long
in
Yorkshire
was
now
on
the
eve
of
fortunate
completion.
His
anxious
and
laborious
efforts
were
likely,
at
last,
to
be
crowned
with
the
happiest
success.
A
truly
eligible
addition
was
about
to
be
made
to
the
family
connections.
"In
Sir
Philip
Nunnely?"
Louis
Moore
conjectured.
Whereupon
Mr.
Sympson
treated
himself
simultaneously
to
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
a
chuckling
laugh,
checked
only
by
a
sudden
choke
of
dignity,
and
an
order
to
the
tutor
to
proceed
with
business.
For
a
day
or
two
Mr.
Sympson
continued
as
bland
as
oil,
but
also
he
seemed
to
sit
on
pins,
and
his
gait,
when
he
walked,
emulated
that
of
a
hen
treading
a
hot
girdle.
He
was
for
ever
looking
out
of
the
window
and
listening
for
chariot
wheels.
Bluebeard's
wife
Sisera's
mother
were
nothing
to
him.
He
waited
when
the
matter
should
be
opened
in
form,
when
himself
should
be
consulted,
when
lawyers
should
be
summoned,
when
settlement
discussions
and
all
