help
them
to
reach
it?
Can
you
give
them
a
field
in
which
their
faculties
may
be
exercised
and
grow?
Men
of
England!
look
at
your
poor
girls,
many
of
them
fading
around
you,
dropping
off
in
consumption
or
decline;
or,
what
is
worse,
degenerating
to
sour
old
maids
envious,
back
biting,
wretched,
because
life
is
a
desert
to
them;
or,
what
is
worst
of
all,
reduced
to
strive,
by
scarce
modest
coquetry
and
debasing
artifice,
to
gain
that
position
and
consideration
by
marriage
which
to
celibacy
is
denied.
Fathers!
cannot
you
alter
these
things?
Perhaps
not
all
at
once;
but
consider
the
matter
well
when
it
is
brought
before
you,
receive
it
as
a
theme
worthy
of
thought;
do
not
dismiss
it
with
an
idle
jest
or
an
unmanly
insult.
You
would
wish
to
be
proud
of
your
daughters,
and
not
to
blush
for
them;
then
seek
for
them
an
interest
and
an
occupation
which
shall
raise
them
above
the
flirt,
the
maneauvrer,
the
mischief
making
tale
bearer.
Keep
your
girls'
minds
narrow
and
fettered;
they
will
still
be
a
plague
and
a
care,
sometimes
a
disgrace
to
you.
Cultivate
them
give
them
scope
and
work;
they
will
be
your
gayest
companions
in
health,
your
tenderest
nurses
in
sickness,
your
most
faithful
prop
in
age."
One
fine
summer
day
that
Caroline
had
spent
entirely
alone
(her
uncle
being
at
Whinbury),
and
whose
long,
bright,
noiseless,
breezeless,
cloudless
hours
(how
many
they
seemed
since
sunrise!)
had
been
to
her
as
desolate
as
if
they
had
gone
over
her
head
in
the
shadowless
and
trackless
wastes
of
Sahara,
instead
of
in
the
blooming
garden
of
an
English
home,
she
was
sitting
in
the
alcove
her
task
of
work
on
her
knee,
her
fingers
assiduously
plying
the
needle,
her
eyes
following
and
regulating
their
movements,
her
brain
working
restlessly
when
Fanny
came
to
the
door,
looked
round
over
the
lawn
and
borders,
and
not
seeing
her
whom
she
sought,
called
out,
"Miss
Caroline!"
A
low
voice
answered
"Fanny!"
It
issued
from
the
alcove,
and
thither
Fanny
hastened,
a
note
in
her
hand,
which
she
delivered
to
fingers
that
hardly
seemed
to
have
nerve
to
hold
it.
Miss
Helstone
did
not
ask
whence
it
came,
and
she
did
not
look
at
it;
she
let
it
drop
amongst
the
folds
of
her
work.
"Joe
Scott's
son,
Harry,
brought
it,"
said
Fanny.
The
girl
was
no
enchantress,
and
knew
no
magic
spell;
yet
what
she
said
took
almost
magical
effect
on
her
young
mistress.
She
lifted
her
head
with
the
quick
motion
of
revived
sensation;
she
shot,
not
a
languid,
but
a
lifelike,
questioning
glance
at
Fanny.
"Harry
Scott!
who
sent
him?"
"He
came
from
the
Hollow."
The
dropped
note
was
snatched
up
eagerly,
the
seal
was
broken
it
was
read
in
two
seconds.
An
affectionate
billet
from
Hortense,
informing
her
young
cousin
that
she
was
returned
from
Wormwood
Wells;
that
she
was
alone
to
day,
as
Robert
was
gone
to
Whinbury
market;
that
nothing
would
give
her
greater
pleasure
than
to
have
Caroline's
company
to
tea,
and
the
good
lady
added,
she
was
quite
sure
such
a
change
would
be
most
acceptable
and
beneficial
to
Caroline,
who
must
be
sadly
at
a
loss
both
for
safe
guidance
and
improving
society
since
the
misunderstanding
between
Robert
and
Mr.
Helstone
had
occasioned
a
separation
from
her
"meilleure
amie,
Hortense
Gerard
Moore."
In
a
postscript
she
was
urged
to
put
on
her
bonnet
and
run
down
directly.
Caroline
did
not
need
the
injunction.
Glad
was
she
to
lay
by
the
brown
holland
child's
slip
she
was
trimming
with
braid
for
the
Jew's
basket,
to
hasten
upstairs,
cover
her
curls
with
her
straw
bonnet,
and
throw
round
her
shoulders
the
black
silk
scarf,
whose
simple
drapery
suited
as
well
her
shape
as
its
dark
hue
set
off
the
purity
of
her
dress
and
the
fairness
of
her
face;
glad
was
she
to
escape
for
a
few
hours
the
solitude,
the
sadness,
the
nightmare
of
her
life;
glad
to
run
down
the
green
lane
sloping
to
the
Hollow,
to
scent
the
fragrance
of
hedge
flowers
sweeter
than
the
perfume
of
moss
rose
or
lily.
True,
she
knew
Robert
was
not
at
the
cottage;
but
it
was
delight
to
go
where
he
had
lately
been.
So
long,
so
totally
separated
from
him,
merely
to
see
his
home,
to
enter
the
room
where
he
had
that
morning
sat,
felt
like
a
reunion.
As
such
it
revived
her;
and
then
Illusion
was
again
following
her
in
Peri
mask.
The
soft
agitation
of
wings
caressed
her
cheek,
and
the
air,
breathing
from
the
blue
summer
sky,
bore
a
voice
which
whispered,
"Robert
may
come
home
while
you
are
in
his
house,
and
then,
at
least,
you
may
look
in
his
face
at
least
you
may
give
him
your
hand;
perhaps,
for
a
minute,
you
may
sit
beside
him."
"Silence!"
was
her
austere
response;
but
she
loved
the
comforter
and
the
consolation.
Miss
Moore
probably
caught
from
the
window
the
gleam
and
flutter
of
Caroline's
white
attire
through
the
branchy
garden
shrubs,
for
she
advanced
from
the
cottage
porch
to
meet
her.
Straight,
unbending,
phlegmatic
as
usual,
she
came
on.
No
haste
or
ecstasy
was
ever
permitted
to
disorder
the
dignity
of
her
movements;
but
she
smiled,
well
pleased
to
mark
the
delight
of
her
pupil,
to
feel
her
kiss
and
the
gentle,
genial
strain
of
her
embrace.
She
led
her
tenderly
in,
half
deceived
and
wholly
flattered.
Half
deceived!
had
it
not
been
so
she
would
in
all
probability
have
put
her
to
the
wicket,
and
shut
her
out.
Had
she
known
clearly
to
whose
account
the
chief
share
of
this
childlike
joy
was
to
be
placed,
Hortense
would
most
likely
have
felt
both
shocked
and
incensed.
Sisters
do
not
like
young
ladies
to
fall
in
love
with
their
brothers.
It
seems,
if
not
presumptuous,
silly,
weak,
a
delusion,
an
absurd
mistake.
They
do
not
love
these
gentlemen
whatever
sisterly
affection
they
may
