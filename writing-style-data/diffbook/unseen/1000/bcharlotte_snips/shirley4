in
a
decent
English
parish,
bring
disgrace
on
those
who
indulge
in
them,
and,
what
is
far
worse,
on
the
sacred
institution
of
which
they
are
merely
the
humble
appendages."
There
was
a
certain
dignity
in
the
little
elderly
gentleman's
manner
of
rebuking
these
youths,
though
it
was
not,
perhaps,
quite
the
dignity
most
appropriate
to
the
occasion.
Mr.
Helstone,
standing
straight
as
a
ramrod,
looking
keen
as
a
kite,
presented,
despite
his
clerical
hat,
black
coat,
and
gaiters,
more
the
air
of
a
veteran
officer
chiding
his
subalterns
than
of
a
venerable
priest
exhorting
his
sons
in
the
faith.
Gospel
mildness,
apostolic
benignity,
never
seemed
to
have
breathed
their
influence
over
that
keen
brown
visage,
but
firmness
had
fixed
the
features,
and
sagacity
had
carved
her
own
lines
about
them.
"I
met
Supplehough,"
he
continued,
"plodding
through
the
mud
this
wet
night,
going
to
preach
at
Milldean
opposition
shop.
As
I
told
you,
I
heard
Barraclough
bellowing
in
the
midst
of
a
conventicle
like
a
possessed
bull;
and
I
find
you,
gentlemen,
tarrying
over
your
half
pint
of
muddy
port
wine,
and
scolding
like
angry
old
women.
No
wonder
Supplehough
should
have
dipped
sixteen
adult
converts
in
a
day
which
he
did
a
fortnight
since;
no
wonder
Barraclough,
scamp
and
hypocrite
as
he
is,
should
attract
all
the
weaver
girls
in
their
flowers
and
ribbons,
to
witness
how
much
harder
are
his
knuckles
than
the
wooden
brim
of
his
tub;
as
little
wonder
that
you,
when
you
are
left
to
yourselves,
without
your
rectors
myself,
and
Hall,
and
Boultby
to
back
you,
should
too
often
perform
the
holy
service
of
our
church
to
bare
walls,
and
read
your
bit
of
a
dry
discourse
to
the
clerk,
and
the
organist,
and
the
beadle.
But
enough
of
the
subject.
I
came
to
see
Malone.
I
have
an
errand
unto
thee,
O
captain!"
"What
is
it?"
inquired
Malone
discontentedly.
"There
can
be
no
funeral
to
take
at
this
time
of
day."
"Have
you
any
arms
about
you?"
"Arms,
sir?
yes,
and
legs."
And
he
advanced
the
mighty
members.
"Bah!
weapons
I
mean."
"I
have
the
pistols
you
gave
me
yourself.
I
never
part
with
them.
I
lay
them
ready
cocked
on
a
chair
by
my
bedside
at
night.
I
have
my
blackthorn."
"Very
good.
Will
you
go
to
Hollow's
Mill?"
"What
is
stirring
at
Hollow's
Mill?"
"Nothing
as
yet,
nor
perhaps
will
be;
but
Moore
is
alone
there.
He
has
sent
all
the
workmen
he
can
trust
to
Stilbro';
there
are
only
two
women
left
about
the
place.
It
would
be
a
nice
opportunity
for
any
of
his
well
wishers
to
pay
him
a
visit,
if
they
knew
how
straight
the
path
was
made
before
them."
"I
am
none
of
his
well
wishers,
sir.
I
don't
care
for
him."
"Soh!
Malone,
you
are
afraid."
"You
know
me
better
than
that.
If
I
really
thought
there
was
a
chance
of
a
row
I
would
go:
but
Moore
is
a
strange,
shy
man,
whom
I
never
pretend
to
understand;
and
for
the
sake
of
his
sweet
company
only
I
would
not
stir
a
step."
"But
there
is
a
chance
of
a
row;
if
a
positive
riot
does
not
take
place
of
which,
indeed,
I
see
no
signs
yet
it
is
unlikely
this
night
will
pass
quite
tranquilly.
You
know
Moore
has
resolved
to
have
new
machinery,
and
he
expects
two
wagon
loads
of
frames
and
shears
from
Stilbro'
this
evening.
Scott,
the
overlooker,
and
a
few
picked
men
are
gone
to
fetch
them."
"They
will
bring
them
in
safely
and
quietly
enough,
sir."
"Moore
says
so,
and
affirms
he
wants
nobody.
Some
one,
however,
he
must
have,
if
it
were
only
to
bear
evidence
in
case
anything
should
happen.
I
call
him
very
careless.
He
sits
in
the
counting
house
with
the
shutters
unclosed;
he
goes
out
here
and
there
after
dark,
wanders
right
up
the
hollow,
down
Fieldhead
Lane,
among
the
plantations,
just
as
if
he
were
the
darling
of
the
neighbourhood,
or
being,
as
he
is,
its
detestation
bore
a
'charmed
life,'
as
they
say
in
tale
books.
He
takes
no
warning
from
the
fate
of
Pearson,
nor
from
that
of
Armitage
shot,
one
in
his
own
house
and
the
other
on
the
moor."
"But
he
should
take
warning,
sir,
and
use
precautions
too,"
interposed
Mr.
Sweeting;
"and
I
think
he
would
if
he
heard
what
I
heard
the
other
day."
"What
did
you
hear,
Davy?"
"You
know
Mike
Hartley,
sir?"
"The
Antinomian
weaver?
Yes."
"When
Mike
has
been
drinking
for
a
few
weeks
together,
he
generally
winds
up
by
a
visit
to
Nunnely
vicarage,
to
tell
Mr.
Hall
a
piece
of
his
mind
about
his
sermons,
to
denounce
the
horrible
tendency
of
his
doctrine
of
works,
and
warn
him
that
he
and
all
his
hearers
are
sitting
in
outer
darkness."
"Well,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
Moore."
"Besides
being
an
Antinomian,
he
is
a
violent
Jacobin
and
leveller,
sir."
"I
know.
When
he
is
very
drunk,
his
mind
is
always
running
on
regicide.
Mike
is
not
unacquainted
with
history,
and
it
is
rich
to
hear
him
going
over
the
list
of
tyrants
of
whom,
as
he
says,
'the
revenger
of
blood
has
obtained
satisfaction.'
The
fellow
exults
strangely
in
murder
done
on
crowned
heads
or
on
any
head
for
political
reasons.
I
have
already
heard
it
hinted
that
he
seems
to
have
a
queer
hankering
after
Moore.
Is
that
what
you
allude
to,
Sweeting?"
"You
use
the
proper
term,
sir.
Mr.
Hall
thinks
Mike
has
no
personal
hatred
of
Moore.
Mike
says
he
even
likes
to
talk
to
him
and
run
after
him,
but
he
has
a
hankering
that
Moore
should
be
made
an
example
of.
He
was
extolling
him
to
Mr.
Hall
the
other
day
as
the
mill
owner
with
the
most
brains
in
Yorkshire,
and
for
that
reason
he
affirms
Moore
should
be
chosen
as
a
sacrifice,
an
oblation
of
a
sweet
savour.
Is
Mike
Hartley
in
his
