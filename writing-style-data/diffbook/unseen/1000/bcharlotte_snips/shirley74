"I
choose
to
doubt
their
truth."
"I
am
afraid
that
proves
you
are
already
caught."
"Not
I.
But
if
I
were,
do
you
know
what
soothsayers
I
would
consult?"
"Let
me
hear."
"Neither
man
nor
woman,
elderly
nor
young:
the
little
Irish
beggar
that
comes
barefoot
to
my
door;
the
mouse
that
steals
out
of
the
cranny
in
the
wainscot;
the
bird
that
in
frost
and
snow
pecks
at
my
window
for
a
crumb;
the
dog
that
licks
my
hand
and
sits
beside
my
knee."
"Did
you
ever
see
any
one
who
was
kind
to
such
things?"
"Did
you
ever
see
any
one
whom
such
things
seemed
instinctively
to
follow,
like,
rely
on?"
"We
have
a
black
cat
and
an
old
dog
at
the
rectory.
I
know
somebody
to
whose
knee
that
black
cat
loves
to
climb,
against
whose
shoulder
and
cheek
it
likes
to
purr.
The
old
dog
always
comes
out
of
his
kennel
and
wags
his
tail,
and
whines
affectionately
when
somebody
passes."
"And
what
does
that
somebody
do?"
"He
quietly
strokes
the
cat,
and
lets
her
sit
while
he
conveniently
can;
and
when
he
must
disturb
her
by
rising,
he
puts
her
softly
down,
and
never
flings
her
from
him
roughly.
He
always
whistles
to
the
dog
and
gives
him
a
caress."
"Does
he?
It
is
not
Robert?"
"But
it
is
Robert."
"Handsome
fellow!"
said
Shirley,
with
enthusiasm.
Her
eyes
sparkled.
"Is
he
not
handsome?
Has
he
not
fine
eyes
and
well
cut
features,
and
a
clear,
princely
forehead?"
"He
has
all
that,
Caroline.
Bless
him!
he
is
both
graceful
and
good."
"I
was
sure
you
would
see
that
he
was.
When
I
first
looked
at
your
face
I
knew
you
would."
"I
was
well
inclined
to
him
before
I
saw
him.
I
liked
him
when
I
did
see
him.
I
admire
him
now.
There
is
charm
in
beauty
for
itself,
Caroline;
when
it
is
blent
with
goodness,
there
is
a
powerful
charm."
"When
mind
is
added,
Shirley?"
"Who
can
resist
it?"
"Remember
my
uncle,
Mesdames
Pryor,
Yorke,
and
Mann."
"Remember
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
of
Egypt.
He
is
a
noble
being.
I
tell
you
when
they
are
good
they
are
the
lords
of
the
creation
they
are
the
sons
of
God.
Moulded
in
their
Maker's
image,
the
minutest
spark
of
His
spirit
lifts
them
almost
above
mortality.
Indisputably,
a
great,
good,
handsome
man
is
the
first
of
created
things."
"Above
us?"
"I
would
scorn
to
contend
for
empire
with
him
I
would
scorn
it.
Shall
my
left
hand
dispute
for
precedence
with
my
right?
Shall
my
heart
quarrel
with
my
pulse?
Shall
my
veins
be
jealous
of
the
blood
which
fills
them?"
"Men
and
women,
husbands
and
wives,
quarrel
horribly,
Shirley."
"Poor
things!
Poor,
fallen,
degenerate
things!
God
made
them
for
another
lot,
for
other
feelings."
"But
are
we
men's
equals,
or
are
we
not?"
"Nothing
ever
charms
me
more
than
when
I
meet
my
superior
one
who
makes
me
sincerely
feel
that
he
is
my
superior."
"Did
you
ever
meet
him?"
"I
should
be
glad
to
see
him
any
day.
The
higher
above
me,
so
much
the
better.
It
degrades
to
stoop;
it
is
glorious
to
look
up.
What
frets
me
is,
that
when
I
try
to
esteem,
I
am
baffled;
when
religiously
inclined,
there
are
but
false
gods
to
adore.
I
disdain
to
be
a
pagan."
"Miss
Keeldar,
will
you
come
in?
We
are
here
at
the
rectory
gates."
"Not
to
day,
but
to
morrow
I
shall
fetch
you
to
spend
the
evening
with
me.
Caroline
Helstone,
if
you
really
are
what
at
present
to
me
you
seem,
you
and
I
will
suit.
I
have
never
in
my
whole
life
been
able
to
talk
to
a
young
lady
as
I
have
talked
to
you
this
morning.
Kiss
me
and
good
bye."
Mrs.
Pryor
seemed
as
well
disposed
to
cultivate
Caroline's
acquaintance
as
Shirley.
She,
who
went
nowhere
else,
called
on
an
early
day
at
the
rectory.
She
came
in
the
afternoon,
when
the
rector
happened
to
be
out.
It
was
rather
a
close
day;
the
heat
of
the
weather
had
flushed
her,
and
she
seemed
fluttered
too
by
the
circumstance
of
entering
a
strange
house,
for
it
appeared
her
habits
were
most
retiring
and
secluded.
When
Miss
Helstone
went
to
her
in
the
dining
room
she
found
her
seated
on
the
sofa,
trembling,
fanning
herself
with
her
handkerchief,
and
seeming
to
contend
with
a
nervous
discomposure
that
threatened
to
become
hysterical.
Caroline
marvelled
somewhat
at
this
unusual
want
of
self
command
in
a
lady
of
her
years,
and
also
at
the
lack
of
real
strength
in
one
who
appeared
almost
robust
for
Mrs.
Pryor
hastened
to
allege
the
fatigue
of
her
walk,
the
heat
of
the
sun,
etc.,
as
reasons
for
her
temporary
indisposition;
and
still
as,
with
more
hurry
than
coherence,
she
again
and
again
enumerated
these
causes
of
exhaustion,
Caroline
gently
sought
to
relieve
her
by
opening
her
shawl
and
removing
her
bonnet.
Attentions
of
this
sort
Mrs.
Pryor
would
not
have
accepted
from
every
one.
In
general
she
recoiled
from
touch
or
close
approach
with
a
mixture
of
embarrassment
and
coldness
far
from
flattering
to
those
who
offered
her
aid.
To
Miss
Helstone's
little
light
hand,
however,
she
yielded
tractably,
and
seemed
soothed
by
its
contact.
In
a
few
minutes
she
ceased
to
tremble,
and
grew
quiet
and
tranquil.
Her
usual
manner
being
resumed,
she
proceeded
to
talk
of
ordinary
topics.
In
a
miscellaneous
company
Mrs.
Pryor
rarely
opened
her
lips,
or,
if
obliged
to
speak,
she
spoke
under
restraint,
and
consequently
not
well;
in
dialogue
she
was
a
good
converser.
Her
language,
always
a
little
formal,
was
well
chosen;
her
sentiments
were
just;
her
information
was
varied
and
correct.
Caroline
felt
it
pleasant
to
listen
to
her,
more
pleasant
than
she
could
have
anticipated.
On
the
wall
opposite
the
sofa
where
they
sat
hung
three
pictures
the
centre
one,
above
the
mantelpiece,
that
of
a
lady;
the
two
others,
