the
red
grate.
"Comfortable
quarters
you
have
here,
Mr.
Moore;
and
all
snug
to
yourself."
"Yes,
but
my
sister
would
be
glad
to
see
you,
if
you
would
prefer
stepping
into
the
house."
"Oh
no!
The
ladies
are
best
alone,
I
never
was
a
lady's
man.
You
don't
mistake
me
for
my
friend
Sweeting,
do
you,
Mr.
Moore?"
"Sweeting!
Which
of
them
is
that?
The
gentleman
in
the
chocolate
overcoat,
or
the
little
gentleman?"
"The
little
one
he
of
Nunnely;
the
cavalier
of
the
Misses
Sykes,
with
the
whole
six
of
whom
he
is
in
love,
ha!
ha!"
"Better
be
generally
in
love
with
all
than
specially
with
one,
I
should
think,
in
that
quarter."
"But
he
is
specially
in
love
with
one
besides,
for
when
I
and
Donne
urged
him
to
make
a
choice
amongst
the
fair
bevy,
he
named
which
do
you
think?"
With
a
queer,
quiet
smile
Mr.
Moore
replied,
"Dora,
of
course,
or
Harriet."
"Ha!
ha!
you've
an
excellent
guess.
But
what
made
you
hit
on
those
two?"
"Because
they
are
the
tallest,
the
handsomest,
and
Dora,
at
least,
is
the
stoutest;
and
as
your
friend
Mr.
Sweeting
is
but
a
little
slight
figure,
I
concluded
that,
according
to
a
frequent
rule
in
such
cases,
he
preferred
his
contrast."
"You
are
right;
Dora
it
is.
But
he
has
no
chance,
has
he,
Moore?"
"What
has
Mr.
Sweeting
besides
his
curacy?"
This
question
seemed
to
tickle
Malone
amazingly.
He
laughed
for
full
three
minutes
before
he
answered
it.
"What
has
Sweeting?
Why,
David
has
his
harp,
or
flute,
which
comes
to
the
same
thing.
He
has
a
sort
of
pinchbeck
watch;
ditto,
ring;
ditto,
eyeglass.
That's
what
he
has."
"How
would
he
propose
to
keep
Miss
Sykes
in
gowns
only?"
"Ha!
ha!
Excellent!
I'll
ask
him
that
next
time
I
see
him.
I'll
roast
him
for
his
presumption.
But
no
doubt
he
expects
old
Christopher
Sykes
would
do
something
handsome.
He
is
rich,
is
he
not?
They
live
in
a
large
house."
"Sykes
carries
on
an
extensive
concern."
"Therefore
he
must
be
wealthy,
eh?"
"Therefore
he
must
have
plenty
to
do
with
his
wealth,
and
in
these
times
would
be
about
as
likely
to
think
of
drawing
money
from
the
business
to
give
dowries
to
his
daughters
as
I
should
be
to
dream
of
pulling
down
the
cottage
there,
and
constructing
on
its
ruins
a
house
as
large
as
Fieldhead."
"Do
you
know
what
I
heard,
Moore,
the
other
day?"
"No.
Perhaps
that
I
was
about
to
effect
some
such
change.
Your
Briarfield
gossips
are
capable
of
saying
that
or
sillier
things."
"That
you
were
going
to
take
Fieldhead
on
a
lease
(I
thought
it
looked
a
dismal
place,
by
the
bye,
to
night,
as
I
passed
it),
and
that
it
was
your
intention
to
settle
a
Miss
Sykes
there
as
mistress
to
be
married,
in
short,
ha!
ha!
Now,
which
is
it?
Dora,
I
am
sure.
You
said
she
was
the
handsomest."
"I
wonder
how
often
it
has
been
settled
that
I
was
to
be
married
since
I
came
to
Briarfield.
They
have
assigned
me
every
marriageable
single
woman
by
turns
in
the
district.
Now
it
was
the
two
Misses
Wynns
first
the
dark,
then
the
light
one;
now
the
red
haired
Miss
Armitage;
then
the
mature
Ann
Pearson.
At
present
you
throw
on
my
shoulders
all
the
tribe
of
the
Misses
Sykes.
On
what
grounds
this
gossip
rests
God
knows.
I
visit
nowhere;
I
seek
female
society
about
as
assiduously
as
you
do,
Mr.
Malone.
If
ever
I
go
to
Whinbury,
it
is
only
to
give
Sykes
or
Pearson
a
call
in
their
counting
house,
where
our
discussions
run
on
other
topics
than
matrimony,
and
our
thoughts
are
occupied
with
other
things
than
courtships,
establishments,
dowries.
The
cloth
we
can't
sell,
the
hands
we
can't
employ,
the
mills
we
can't
run,
the
perverse
course
of
events
generally,
which
we
cannot
alter,
fill
our
hearts,
I
take
it,
pretty
well
at
present,
to
the
tolerably
complete
exclusion
of
such
figments
as
love
making,
etc."
"I
go
along
with
you
completely,
Moore.
If
there
is
one
notion
I
hate
more
than
another,
it
is
that
of
marriage
I
mean
marriage
in
the
vulgar
weak
sense,
as
a
mere
matter
of
sentiment
two
beggarly
fools
agreeing
to
unite
their
indigence
by
some
fantastic
tie
of
feeling.
Humbug!
But
an
advantageous
connection,
such
as
can
be
formed
in
consonance
with
dignity
of
views
and
permanency
of
solid
interests,
is
not
so
bad
eh?"
"No,"
responded
Moore,
in
an
absent
manner.
The
subject
seemed
to
have
no
interest
for
him;
he
did
not
pursue
it.
After
sitting
for
some
time
gazing
at
the
fire
with
a
preoccupied
air,
he
suddenly
turned
his
head.
"Hark!"
said
he.
"Did
you
hear
wheels?"
Rising,
he
went
to
the
window,
opened
it,
and
listened.
He
soon
closed
it.
"It
is
only
the
sound
of
the
wind
rising,"
he
remarked,
"and
the
rivulet
a
little
swollen,
rushing
down
the
hollow.
I
expected
those
wagons
at
six;
it
is
near
nine
now."
"Seriously,
do
you
suppose
that
the
putting
up
of
this
new
machinery
will
bring
you
into
danger?"
inquired
Malone.
"Helstone
seems
to
think
it
will."
"I
only
wish
the
machines
the
frames
were
safe
here,
and
lodged
within
the
walls
of
this
mill.
Once
put
up,
I
defy
the
frame
breakers.
Let
them
only
pay
me
a
visit
and
take
the
consequences.
My
mill
is
my
castle."
"One
despises
such
low
scoundrels,"
observed
Malone,
in
a
profound
vein
of
reflection.
"I
almost
wish
a
party
would
call
upon
you
to
night;
but
the
road
seemed
extremely
quiet
as
I
came
along.
I
saw
nothing
astir."
"You
came
by
the
Redhouse?"
"Yes."
"There
would
be
nothing
on
that
road.
It
is
in
the
direction
of
Stilbro'
the
risk
lies."
"And
you
think
there
is
risk?"
"What
these
fellows
have
done
to
others
they
may
do
to
me.
There
is
only
this
difference:
most
of
the
