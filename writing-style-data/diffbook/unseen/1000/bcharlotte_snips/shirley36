die,
and
you
will
have
learned
the
great
lesson
how
to
endure
without
a
sob.
For
the
whole
remnant
of
your
life,
if
you
survive
the
test
some,
it
is
said,
die
under
it
you
will
be
stronger,
wiser,
less
sensitive.
This
you
are
not
aware
of,
perhaps,
at
the
time,
and
so
cannot
borrow
courage
of
that
hope.
Nature,
however,
as
has
been
intimated,
is
an
excellent
friend
in
such
cases,
sealing
the
lips,
interdicting
utterance,
commanding
a
placid
dissimulation
a
dissimulation
often
wearing
an
easy
and
gay
mien
at
first,
settling
down
to
sorrow
and
paleness
in
time,
then
passing
away,
and
leaving
a
convenient
stoicism,
not
the
less
fortifying
because
it
is
half
bitter.
Half
bitter!
Is
that
wrong?
No;
it
should
be
bitter:
bitterness
is
strength
it
is
a
tonic.
Sweet,
mild
force
following
acute
suffering
you
find
nowhere;
to
talk
of
it
is
delusion.
There
may
be
apathetic
exhaustion
after
the
rack.
If
energy
remains,
it
will
be
rather
a
dangerous
energy
deadly
when
confronted
with
injustice.
Who
has
read
the
ballad
of
"Puir
Mary
Lee"
that
old
Scotch
ballad,
written
I
know
not
in
what
generation
nor
by
what
hand?
Mary
had
been
ill
used
probably
in
being
made
to
believe
that
truth
which
was
falsehood.
She
is
not
complaining,
but
she
is
sitting
alone
in
the
snowstorm,
and
you
hear
her
thoughts.
They
are
not
the
thoughts
of
a
model
heroine
under
her
circumstances,
but
they
are
those
of
a
deeply
feeling,
strongly
resentful
peasant
girl.
Anguish
has
driven
her
from
the
ingle
nook
of
home
to
the
white
shrouded
and
icy
hills.
Crouched
under
the
"cauld
drift,"
she
recalls
every
image
of
horror
"the
yellow
wymed
ask,"
"the
hairy
adder,"
"the
auld
moon
bowing
tyke,"
"the
ghaist
at
e'en,",
"the
sour
bullister,"
"the
milk
on
the
taed's
back."
She
hates
these,
but
"waur
she
hates
Robin
a
Ree."
"Oh,
ance
I
lived
happily
by
yon
bonny
burn
The
warld
was
in
love
wi'
me;
But
now
I
maun
sit
'neath
the
cauld
drift
and
mourn,
And
curse
black
Robin
a
Ree!
"Then
whudder
awa,
thou
bitter
biting
blast,
And
sough
through
the
scrunty
tree,
And
smoor
me
up
in
the
snaw
fu'
fast,
And
n'er
let
the
sun
me
see!
"Oh,
never
melt
awa,
thou
wreath
o'
snaw,
That's
sae
kind
in
graving
me;
But
hide
me
frae
the
scorn
and
guffaw
O'
villains
like
Robin
a
Ree!"
But
what
has
been
said
in
the
last
page
or
two
is
not
germane
to
Caroline
Helstone's
feelings,
or
to
the
state
of
things
between
her
and
Robert
Moore.
Robert
had
done
her
no
wrong;
he
had
told
her
no
lie;
it
was
she
that
was
to
blame,
if
any
one
was.
What
bitterness
her
mind
distilled
should
and
would
be
poured
on
her
own
head.
She
had
loved
without
being
asked
to
love
a
natural,
sometimes
an
inevitable
chance,
but
big
with
misery.
Robert,
indeed,
had
sometimes
seemed
to
be
fond
of
her;
but
why?
Because
she
had
made
herself
so
pleasing
to
him,
he
could
not,
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts,
help
testifying
a
state
of
feeling
his
judgment
did
not
approve
nor
his
will
sanction.
He
was
about
to
withdraw
decidedly
from
intimate
communication
with
her,
because
he
did
not
choose
to
have
his
affections
inextricably
entangled,
nor
to
be
drawn,
despite
his
reason,
into
a
marriage
he
believed
imprudent.
Now,
what
was
she
to
do?
To
give
way
to
her
feelings,
or
to
vanquish
them?
To
pursue
him,
or
to
turn
upon
herself?
If
she
is
weak,
she
will
try
the
first
expedient
will
lose
his
esteem
and
win
his
aversion;
if
she
has
sense,
she
will
be
her
own
governor,
and
resolve
to
subdue
and
bring
under
guidance
the
disturbed
realm
of
her
emotions.
She
will
determine
to
look
on
life
steadily,
as
it
is;
to
begin
to
learn
its
severe
truths
seriously,
and
to
study
its
knotty
problems
closely,
conscientiously.
It
appeared
she
had
a
little
sense,
for
she
quitted
Robert
quietly,
without
complaint
or
question,
without
the
alteration
of
a
muscle
or
the
shedding
of
a
tear,
betook
herself
to
her
studies
under
Hortense
as
usual,
and
at
dinner
time
went
home
without
lingering.
When
she
had
dined,
and
found
herself
in
the
rectory
drawing
room
alone,
having
left
her
uncle
over
his
temperate
glass
of
port
wine,
the
difficulty
that
occurred
to
and
embarrassed
her
was,
"How
am
I
to
get
through
this
day?"
Last
night
she
had
hoped
it
would
be
spent
as
yesterday
was,
that
the
evening
would
be
again
passed
with
happiness
and
Robert.
She
had
learned
her
mistake
this
morning;
and
yet
she
could
not
settle
down,
convinced
that
no
chance
would
occur
to
recall
her
to
Hollow's
Cottage,
or
to
bring
Moore
again
into
her
society.
He
had
walked
up
after
tea
more
than
once
to
pass
an
hour
with
her
uncle.
The
door
bell
had
rung,
his
voice
had
been
heard
in
the
passage
just
at
twilight,
when
she
little
expected
such
a
pleasure;
and
this
had
happened
twice
after
he
had
treated
her
with
peculiar
reserve;
and
though
he
rarely
talked
to
her
in
her
uncle's
presence,
he
had
looked
at
her
relentingly
as
he
sat
opposite
her
work
table
during
his
stay.
The
few
words
he
had
spoken
to
her
were
comforting;
his
manner
on
bidding
her
good
night
was
genial.
Now,
he
might
come
this
evening,
said
False
Hope.
She
almost
knew
it
was
False
Hope
which
breathed
the
whisper,
and
yet
she
listened.
She
tried
to
read
her
thoughts
wandered;
she
tried
to
sew
every
stitch
she
put
in
was
an
ennui,
the
occupation
was
insufferably
tedious;
she
opened
her
desk
and
attempted
to
write
a
French
composition
she
wrote
nothing
but
mistakes.
Suddenly
the
door
bell
sharply
rang;
her
heart
leaped;
she
sprang
to
the
drawing
room
door,
opened
it
softly,
peeped
through
the
aperture.
Fanny
was
admitting
a
visitor
a
gentleman
a
tall
