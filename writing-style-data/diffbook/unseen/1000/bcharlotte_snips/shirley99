in
Yorkshire?
What
more
conclusive
proof
could
be
given
that
he
was
better
than
anything
there?
And
yet
here
was
he
about
to
be
turned
like
a
dog
out
of
a
Yorkshire
garden!
Where,
under
such
circumstances,
was
the
"concatenation
accordingly"?
"Rid
me
of
you
instantly
instantly!"
reiterated
Shirley,
as
he
lingered.
"Madam
a
clergyman!
turn
out
a
clergyman!"
"Off!
Were
you
an
archbishop
you
have
proved
yourself
no
gentleman,
and
must
go.
Quick!"
She
was
quite
resolved.
There
was
no
trifling
with
her.
Besides,
Tartar
was
again
rising;
he
perceived
symptoms
of
a
commotion;
he
manifested
a
disposition
to
join
in.
There
was
evidently
nothing
for
it
but
to
go,
and
Donne
made
his
exodus,
the
heiress
sweeping
him
a
deep
curtsy
as
she
closed
the
gates
on
him.
"How
dare
the
pompous
priest
abuse
his
flock!
How
dare
the
lisping
cockney
revile
Yorkshire!"
was
her
sole
observation
on
the
circumstance,
as
she
returned
to
the
table.
Ere
long
the
little
party
broke
up;
Miss
Keeldar's
ruffled
and
darkened
brow,
curled
lip,
and
incensed
eye
gave
no
invitation
to
further
social
enjoyment.
The
fund
prospered.
By
dint
of
Miss
Keeldar's
example,
the
three
rectors'
vigorous
exertions,
and
the
efficient
though
quiet
aid
of
their
spinster
and
spectacled
lieutenants,
Mary
Ann
Ainley
and
Margaret
Hall,
a
handsome
sum
was
raised;
and
this
being
judiciously
managed,
served
for
the
present
greatly
to
alleviate
the
distress
of
the
unemployed
poor.
The
neighbourhood
seemed
to
grow
calmer.
For
a
fortnight
past
no
cloth
had
been
destroyed;
no
outrage
on
mill
or
mansion
had
been
committed
in
the
three
parishes.
Shirley
was
sanguine
that
the
evil
she
wished
to
avert
was
almost
escaped,
that
the
threatened
storm
was
passing
over.
With
the
approach
of
summer
she
felt
certain
that
trade
would
improve
it
always
did;
and
then
this
weary
war
could
not
last
for
ever;
peace
must
return
one
day.
With
peace,
what
an
impulse
would
be
given
to
commerce!
Such
was
the
usual
tenor
of
her
observations
to
her
tenant,
Gerard
Moore,
whenever
she
met
him
where
they
could
converse;
and
Moore
would
listen
very
quietly
too
quietly
to
satisfy
her.
She
would
then
by
her
impatient
glance
demand
something
more
from
him
some
explanation,
or
at
least
some
additional
remark.
Smiling
in
his
way,
with
that
expression
which
gave
a
remarkable
cast
of
sweetness
to
his
mouth,
while
his
brow
remained
grave,
he
would
answer
to
the
effect
that
himself
too
trusted
in
the
finite
nature
of
the
war;
that
it
was
indeed
on
that
ground
the
anchor
of
his
hopes
was
fixed;
thereon
his
speculations
depended.
"For
you
are
aware,"
he
would
continue,
"that
I
now
work
Hollow's
Mill
entirely
on
speculation.
I
sell
nothing;
there
is
no
market
for
my
goods.
I
manufacture
for
a
future
day.
I
make
myself
ready
to
take
advantage
of
the
first
opening
that
shall
occur.
Three
months
ago
this
was
impossible
to
me;
I
had
exhausted
both
credit
and
capital.
You
well
know
who
came
to
my
rescue,
from
what
hand
I
received
the
loan
which
saved
me.
It
is
on
the
strength
of
that
loan
I
am
enabled
to
continue
the
bold
game
which,
a
while
since,
I
feared
I
should
never
play
more.
Total
ruin
I
know
will
follow
loss,
and
I
am
aware
that
gain
is
doubtful;
but
I
am
quite
cheerful.
So
long
as
I
can
be
active,
so
long
as
I
can
strive,
so
long,
in
short,
as
my
hands
are
not
tied,
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
be
depressed.
One
year
nay,
but
six
months
of
the
reign
of
the
olive,
and
I
am
safe;
for,
as
you
say,
peace
will
give
an
impulse
to
commerce.
In
this
you
are
right;
but
as
to
the
restored
tranquillity
of
the
neighbourhood,
as
to
the
permanent
good
effect
of
your
charitable
fund,
I
doubt.
Eleemosynary
relief
never
yet
tranquillized
the
working
classes
it
never
made
them
grateful;
it
is
not
in
human
nature
that
it
should.
I
suppose,
were
all
things
ordered
aright,
they
ought
not
to
be
in
a
position
to
need
that
humiliating
relief;
and
this
they
feel.
We
should
feel
it
were
we
so
placed.
Besides,
to
whom
should
they
be
grateful?
To
you,
to
the
clergy
perhaps,
but
not
to
us
mill
owners.
They
hate
us
worse
than
ever.
Then
the
disaffected
here
are
in
correspondence
with
the
disaffected
elsewhere.
Nottingham
is
one
of
their
headquarters,
Manchester
another,
Birmingham
a
third.
The
subalterns
receive
orders
from
their
chiefs;
they
are
in
a
good
state
of
discipline;
no
blow
is
struck
without
mature
deliberation.
In
sultry
weather
you
have
seen
the
sky
threaten
thunder
day
by
day,
and
yet
night
after
night
the
clouds
have
cleared,
and
the
sun
has
set
quietly;
but
the
danger
was
not
gone
it
was
only
delayed.
The
long
threatening
storm
is
sure
to
break
at
last.
There
is
analogy
between
the
moral
and
physical
atmosphere."
"Well,
Mr.
Moore"
(so
these
conferences
always
ended),
"take
care
of
yourself.
If
you
think
that
I
have
ever
done
you
any
good,
reward
me
by
promising
to
take
care
of
yourself."
"I
do;
I
will
take
close
and
watchful
care.
I
wish
to
live,
not
to
die.
The
future
opens
like
Eden
before
me;
and
still,
when
I
look
deep
into
the
shades
of
my
paradise,
I
see
a
vision
that
I
like
better
than
seraph
or
cherub
glide
across
remote
vistas."
"Do
you?
Pray,
what
vision?"
"I
see
"
The
maid
came
bustling
in
with
the
tea
things.
The
early
part
of
that
May,
as
we
have
seen,
was
fine;
the
middle
was
wet;
but
in
the
last
week,
at
change
of
moon,
it
cleared
again.
A
fresh
wind
swept
off
the
silver
white,
deep
piled
rain
clouds,
bearing
them,
mass
on
mass,
to
the
eastern
horizon,
on
whose
verge
they
dwindled,
and
behind
whose
rim
they
disappeared,
leaving
the
vault
behind
all
pure
blue
space,
ready
for
the
reign
of
the
summer
