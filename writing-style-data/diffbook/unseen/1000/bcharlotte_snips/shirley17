was
ordinary:
a
racy,
rough
character,
high
or
low,
ever
found
acceptance
with
him;
a
refined,
insipid
personage,
however
exalted
in
station,
was
his
aversion.
He
would
spend
an
hour
any
time
in
talking
freely
with
a
shrewd
workman
of
his
own,
or
with
some
queer,
sagacious
old
woman
amongst
his
cottagers,
when
he
would
have
grudged
a
moment
to
a
commonplace
fine
gentleman
or
to
the
most
fashionable
and
elegant,
if
frivolous,
lady.
His
preferences
on
these
points
he
carried
to
an
extreme,
forgetting
that
there
may
be
amiable
and
even
admirable
characters
amongst
those
who
cannot
be
original.
Yet
he
made
exceptions
to
his
own
rule.
There
was
a
certain
order
of
mind,
plain,
ingenuous,
neglecting
refinement,
almost
devoid
of
intellectuality,
and
quite
incapable
of
appreciating
what
was
intellectual
in
him,
but
which,
at
the
same
time,
never
felt
disgust
at
his
rudeness,
was
not
easily
wounded
by
his
sarcasm,
did
not
closely
analyze
his
sayings,
doings,
or
opinions,
with
which
he
was
peculiarly
at
ease,
and,
consequently,
which
he
peculiarly
preferred.
He
was
lord
amongst
such
characters.
They,
while
submitting
implicitly
to
his
influence,
never
acknowledged,
because
they
never
reflected
on,
his
superiority;
they
were
quite
tractable,
therefore,
without
running
the
smallest
danger
of
being
servile;
and
their
unthinking,
easy,
artless
insensibility
was
as
acceptable,
because
as
convenient,
to
Mr.
Yorke
as
that
of
the
chair
he
sat
on,
or
of
the
floor
he
trod.
It
will
have
been
observed
that
he
was
not
quite
uncordial
with
Mr.
Moore.
He
had
two
or
three
reasons
for
entertaining
a
faint
partiality
to
that
gentleman.
It
may
sound
odd,
but
the
first
of
these
was
that
Moore
spoke
English
with
a
foreign,
and
French
with
a
perfectly
pure,
accent;
and
that
his
dark,
thin
face,
with
its
fine
though
rather
wasted
lines,
had
a
most
anti
British
and
anti
Yorkshire
look.
These
points
seem
frivolous,
unlikely
to
influence
a
character
like
Yorke's;
but
the
fact
is
they
recalled
old,
perhaps
pleasurable,
associations
they
brought
back
his
travelling,
his
youthful
days.
He
had
seen,
amidst
Italian
cities
and
scenes,
faces
like
Moore's;
he
had
heard,
in
Parisian
cafes
and
theatres,
voices
like
his.
He
was
young
then,
and
when
he
looked
at
and
listened
to
the
alien,
he
seemed
young
again.
Secondly,
he
had
known
Moore's
father,
and
had
had
dealings
with
him.
That
was
a
more
substantial,
though
by
no
means
a
more
agreeable
tie;
for
as
his
firm
had
been
connected
with
Moore's
in
business,
it
had
also,
in
some
measure,
been
implicated
in
its
losses.
Thirdly,
he
had
found
Robert
himself
a
sharp
man
of
business.
He
saw
reason
to
anticipate
that
he
would,
in
the
end,
by
one
means
or
another,
make
money;
and
he
respected
both
his
resolution
and
acuteness
perhaps,
also,
his
hardness.
A
fourth
circumstance
which
drew
them
together
was
that
of
Mr.
Yorke
being
one
of
the
guardians
of
the
minor
on
whose
estate
Hollow's
Mill
was
situated;
consequently
Moore,
in
the
course
of
his
alterations
and
improvements,
had
frequent
occasion
to
consult
him.
As
to
the
other
guest
now
present
in
Mr.
Yorke's
parlour,
Mr.
Helstone,
between
him
and
his
host
there
existed
a
double
antipathy
the
antipathy
of
nature
and
that
of
circumstances.
The
free
thinker
hated
the
formalist;
the
lover
of
liberty
detested
the
disciplinarian.
Besides,
it
was
said
that
in
former
years
they
had
been
rival
suitors
of
the
same
lady.
Mr.
Yorke,
as
a
general
rule,
was,
when
young,
noted
for
his
preference
of
sprightly
and
dashing
women:
a
showy
shape
and
air,
a
lively
wit,
a
ready
tongue,
chiefly
seemed
to
attract
him.
He
never,
however,
proposed
to
any
of
these
brilliant
belles
whose
society
he
sought;
and
all
at
once
he
seriously
fell
in
love
with
and
eagerly
wooed
a
girl
who
presented
a
complete
contrast
to
those
he
had
hitherto
noticed
a
girl
with
the
face
of
a
Madonna;
a
girl
of
living
marble
stillness
personified.
No
matter
that,
when
he
spoke
to
her,
she
only
answered
him
in
monosyllables;
no
matter
that
his
sighs
seemed
unheard,
that
his
glances
were
unreturned,
that
she
never
responded
to
his
opinions,
rarely
smiled
at
his
jests,
paid
him
no
respect
and
no
attention;
no
matter
that
she
seemed
the
opposite
of
everything
feminine
he
had
ever
in
his
whole
life
been
known
to
admire.
For
him
Mary
Cave
was
perfect,
because
somehow,
for
some
reason
no
doubt
he
had
a
reason
he
loved
her.
Mr.
Helstone,
at
that
time
curate
of
Briarfield,
loved
Mary
too
or,
at
any
rate,
he
fancied
her.
Several
others
admired
her,
for
she
was
beautiful
as
a
monumental
angel;
but
the
clergyman
was
preferred
for
his
office's
sake
that
office
probably
investing
him
with
some
of
the
illusion
necessary
to
allure
to
the
commission
of
matrimony,
and
which
Miss
Cave
did
not
find
in
any
of
the
young
wool
staplers,
her
other
adorers.
Mr.
Helstone
neither
had,
nor
professed
to
have,
Mr.
Yorke's
absorbing
passion
for
her.
He
had
none
of
the
humble
reverence
which
seemed
to
subdue
most
of
her
suitors;
he
saw
her
more
as
she
really
was
than
the
rest
did.
He
was,
consequently,
more
master
of
her
and
himself.
She
accepted
him
at
the
first
offer,
and
they
were
married.
Nature
never
intended
Mr.
Helstone
to
make
a
very
good
husband,
especially
to
a
quiet
wife.
He
thought
so
long
as
a
woman
was
silent
nothing
ailed
her,
and
she
wanted
nothing.
If
she
did
not
complain
of
solitude,
solitude,
however
continued,
could
not
be
irksome
to
her.
If
she
did
not
talk
and
put
herself
forward,
express
a
partiality
for
this,
an
aversion
to
that,
she
had
no
partialities
or
aversions,
and
it
was
useless
to
consult
her
tastes.
He
made
no
pretence
of
comprehending
women,
or
comparing
them
with
men.
They
were
a
different,
probably
a
very
inferior,
order
of
existence.
A
wife
could
not
be
her
husband's
companion,
much
less
his
confidante,
much
less
