humour,"
replied
Miss
Helstone,
very
truly.
Shirley
had
already
fixed
on
her
a
penetrating
eye.
"No,"
she
said;
"I
see
you
are
not
in
the
humour
for
loving
me.
You
are
in
one
of
your
sunless,
inclement
moods,
when
one
feels
a
fellow
creature's
presence
is
not
welcome
to
you.
You
have
such
moods.
Are
you
aware
of
it?"
"Do
you
mean
to
stay
long,
Shirley?"
"Yes.
I
am
come
to
have
my
tea,
and
must
have
it
before
I
go.
I
shall
take
the
liberty,
then,
of
removing
my
bonnet,
without
being
asked."
And
this
she
did,
and
then
stood
on
the
rug
with
her
hands
behind
her.
"A
pretty
expression
you
have
in
your
countenance,"
she
went
on,
still
gazing
keenly,
though
not
inimically
rather
indeed
pityingly
at
Caroline.
"Wonderfully
self
supported
you
look,
you
solitude
seeking,
wounded
deer.
Are
you
afraid
Shirley
will
worry
you
if
she
discovers
that
you
are
hurt,
and
that
you
bleed?"
"I
never
do
fear
Shirley."
"But
sometimes
you
dislike
her;
often
you
avoid
her.
Shirley
can
feel
when
she
is
slighted
and
shunned.
If
you
had
not
walked
home
in
the
company
you
did
last
night,
you
would
have
been
a
different
girl
to
day.
What
time
did
you
reach
the
rectory?"
"By
ten."
"Humph!
You
took
three
quarters
of
an
hour
to
walk
a
mile.
Was
it
you,
or
Moore,
who
lingered
so?"
"Shirley,
you
talk
nonsense."
"He
talked
nonsense
that
I
doubt
not;
or
he
looked
it,
which
is
a
thousand
times
worse.
I
see
the
reflection
of
his
eyes
on
your
forehead
at
this
moment.
I
feel
disposed
to
call
him
out,
if
I
could
only
get
a
trustworthy
second.
I
feel
desperately
irritated.
I
felt
so
last
night,
and
have
felt
it
all
day."
"You
don't
ask
me
why,"
she
proceeded,
after
a
pause,
"you
little
silent,
over
modest
thing;
and
you
don't
deserve
that
I
should
pour
out
my
secrets
into
your
lap
without
an
invitation.
Upon
my
word,
I
could
have
found
it
in
my
heart
to
have
dogged
Moore
yesterday
evening
with
dire
intent.
I
have
pistols,
and
can
use
them."
"Stuff,
Shirley!
Which
would
you
have
shot
me
or
Robert?"
"Neither,
perhaps.
Perhaps
myself
more
likely
a
bat
or
a
tree
bough.
He
is
a
puppy,
your
cousin
a
quiet,
serious,
sensible,
judicious,
ambitious
puppy.
I
see
him
standing
before
me,
talking
his
half
stern,
half
gentle
talk,
bearing
me
down
(as
I
am
very
conscious
he
does)
with
his
fixity
of
purpose,
etc.;
and
then
I
have
no
patience
with
him!"
Miss
Keeldar
started
off
on
a
rapid
walk
through
the
room,
repeating
energetically
that
she
had
no
patience
with
men
in
general,
and
with
her
tenant
in
particular.
"You
are
mistaken,"
urged
Caroline,
in
some
anxiety.
"Robert
is
no
puppy
or
male
flirt;
I
can
vouch
for
that."
"You
vouch
for
it!
Do
you
think
I'll
take
your
word
on
the
subject?
There
is
no
one's
testimony
I
would
not
credit
sooner
than
yours.
To
advance
Moore's
fortune
you
would
cut
off
your
right
hand."
"But
not
tell
lies.
And
if
I
speak
the
truth,
I
must
assure
you
that
he
was
just
civil
to
me
last
night
that
was
all."
"I
never
asked
what
he
was.
I
can
guess.
I
saw
him
from
the
window
take
your
hand
in
his
long
fingers,
just
as
he
went
out
at
my
gate."
"That
is
nothing.
I
am
not
a
stranger,
you
know.
I
am
an
old
acquaintance,
and
his
cousin."
"I
feel
indignant,
and
that
is
the
long
and
short
of
the
matter,"
responded
Miss
Keeldar.
"All
my
comfort,"
she
added
presently,
"is
broken
up
by
his
maneauvres.
He
keeps
intruding
between
you
and
me.
Without
him
we
should
be
good
friends;
but
that
six
feet
of
puppyhood
makes
a
perpetually
recurring
eclipse
of
our
friendship.
Again
and
again
he
crosses
and
obscures
the
disc
I
want
always
to
see
clear;
ever
and
anon
he
renders
me
to
you
a
mere
bore
and
nuisance."
"No,
Shirley,
no."
"He
does.
You
did
not
want
my
society
this
afternoon,
and
I
feel
it
hard.
You
are
naturally
somewhat
reserved,
but
I
am
a
social
personage,
who
cannot
live
alone.
If
we
were
but
left
unmolested,
I
have
that
regard
for
you
that
I
could
bear
you
in
my
presence
for
ever,
and
not
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
do
I
ever
wish
to
be
rid
of
you.
You
cannot
say
as
much
respecting
me."
"Shirley,
I
can
say
anything
you
wish.
Shirley,
I
like
you."
"You
will
wish
me
at
Jericho
to
morrow,
Lina."
"I
shall
not.
I
am
every
day
growing
more
accustomed
to
fonder
of
you.
You
know
I
am
too
English
to
get
up
a
vehement
friendship
all
at
once;
but
you
are
so
much
better
than
common
you
are
so
different
to
every
day
young
ladies
I
esteem
you,
I
value
you;
you
are
never
a
burden
to
me
never.
Do
you
believe
what
I
say?"
"Partly,"
replied
Miss
Keeldar,
smiling
rather
incredulously;
"but
you
are
a
peculiar
personage.
Quiet
as
you
look,
there
is
both
a
force
and
a
depth
somewhere
within
not
easily
reached
or
appreciated.
Then
you
certainly
are
not
happy."
"And
unhappy
people
are
rarely
good.
Is
that
what
you
mean?"
"Not
at
all.
I
mean
rather
that
unhappy
people
are
often
preoccupied,
and
not
in
the
mood
for
discoursing
with
companions
of
my
nature.
Moreover,
there
is
a
sort
of
unhappiness
which
not
only
depresses,
but
corrodes;
and
that,
I
fear,
is
your
portion.
Will
pity
do
you
any
good,
Lina?
If
it
will,
take
some
from
Shirley;
she
offers
largely,
and
warrants
the
article
genuine."
"Shirley,
I
never
had
a
sister
you
never
had
a
sister;
but
it
flashes
on
me
at
this
moment
how
sisters
feel
towards
each
other
affection
twined
with
their
life,
which
no
shocks
of
feeling
can
uproot,
which
little
quarrels
only
trample
an
instant,
that
it
may
spring
