summoned,
sneered
at
the
hypochondriac
fancies
of
the
rich
and
idle,
who,
she
said,
having
nothing
but
themselves
to
think
about,
must
needs
send
for
a
doctor
if
only
so
much
as
their
little
finger
ached.
The
"rich
and
idle,"
represented
in
the
person
of
Caroline,
were
meantime
falling
fast
into
a
condition
of
prostration,
whose
quickly
consummated
debility
puzzled
all
who
witnessed
it
except
one;
for
that
one
alone
reflected
how
liable
is
the
undermined
structure
to
sink
in
sudden
ruin.
Sick
people
often
have
fancies
inscrutable
to
ordinary
attendants,
and
Caroline
had
one
which
even
her
tender
nurse
could
not
at
first
explain.
On
a
certain
day
in
the
week,
at
a
certain
hour,
she
would
whether
worse
or
better
entreat
to
be
taken
up
and
dressed,
and
suffered
to
sit
in
her
chair
near
the
window.
This
station
she
would
retain
till
noon
was
past.
Whatever
degree
of
exhaustion
or
debility
her
wan
aspect
betrayed,
she
still
softly
put
off
all
persuasion
to
seek
repose
until
the
church
clock
had
duly
tolled
midday.
The
twelve
strokes
sounded,
she
grew
docile,
and
would
meekly
lie
down.
Returned
to
the
couch,
she
usually
buried
her
face
deep
in
the
pillow,
and
drew
the
coverlets
close
round
her,
as
if
to
shut
out
the
world
and
sun,
of
which
she
was
tired.
More
than
once,
as
she
thus
lay,
a
slight
convulsion
shook
the
sick
bed,
and
a
faint
sob
broke
the
silence
round
it.
These
things
were
not
unnoted
by
Mrs.
Pryor.
One
Tuesday
morning,
as
usual,
she
had
asked
leave
to
rise,
and
now
she
sat
wrapped
in
her
white
dressing
gown,
leaning
forward
in
the
easy
chair,
gazing
steadily
and
patiently
from
the
lattice.
Mrs.
Pryor
was
seated
a
little
behind,
knitting
as
it
seemed,
but,
in
truth,
watching
her.
A
change
crossed
her
pale,
mournful
brow,
animating
its
languor;
a
light
shot
into
her
faded
eyes,
reviving
their
lustre;
she
half
rose
and
looked
earnestly
out.
Mrs.
Pryor,
drawing
softly
near,
glanced
over
her
shoulder.
From
this
window
was
visible
the
churchyard,
beyond
it
the
road;
and
there,
riding
sharply
by,
appeared
a
horseman.
The
figure
was
not
yet
too
remote
for
recognition.
Mrs.
Pryor
had
long
sight;
she
knew
Mr.
Moore.
Just
as
an
intercepting
rising
ground
concealed
him
from
view,
the
clock
struck
twelve.
"May
I
lie
down
again?"
asked
Caroline.
Her
nurse
assisted
her
to
bed.
Having
laid
her
down
and
drawn
the
curtain,
she
stood
listening
near.
The
little
couch
trembled,
the
suppressed
sob
stirred
the
air.
A
contraction
as
of
anguish
altered
Mrs.
Pryor's
features;
she
wrung
her
hands;
half
a
groan
escaped
her
lips.
She
now
remembered
that
Tuesday
was
Whinbury
market
day.
Mr.
Moore
must
always
pass
the
rectory
on
his
way
thither,
just
ere
noon
of
that
day.
Caroline
wore
continually
round
her
neck
a
slender
braid
of
silk,
attached
to
which
was
some
trinket.
Mrs.
Pryor
had
seen
the
bit
of
gold
glisten,
but
had
not
yet
obtained
a
fair
view
of
it.
Her
patient
never
parted
with
it.
When
dressed
it
was
hidden
in
her
bosom;
as
she
lay
in
bed
she
always
held
it
in
her
hand.
That
Tuesday
afternoon
the
transient
doze
more
like
lethargy
than
sleep
which
sometimes
abridged
the
long
days,
had
stolen
over
her.
The
weather
was
hot.
While
turning
in
febrile
restlessness,
she
had
pushed
the
coverlets
a
little
aside.
Mrs.
Pryor
bent
to
replace
them.
The
small,
wasted
hand,
lying
nerveless
on
the
sick
girl's
breast,
clasped
as
usual
her
jealously
guarded
treasure.
Those
fingers
whose
attenuation
it
gave
pain
to
see
were
now
relaxed
in
sleep.
Mrs.
Pryor
gently
disengaged
the
braid,
drawing
out
a
tiny
locket
a
slight
thing
it
was,
such
as
it
suited
her
small
purse
to
purchase.
Under
its
crystal
face
appeared
a
curl
of
black
hair,
too
short
and
crisp
to
have
been
severed
from
a
female
head.
Some
agitated
movement
occasioned
a
twitch
of
the
silken
chain.
The
sleeper
started
and
woke.
Her
thoughts
were
usually
now
somewhat
scattered
on
waking,
her
look
generally
wandering.
Half
rising,
as
if
in
terror,
she
exclaimed,
"Don't
take
it
from
me,
Robert!
Don't!
It
is
my
last
comfort;
let
me
keep
it.
I
never
tell
any
one
whose
hair
it
is;
I
never
show
it."
Mrs.
Pryor
had
already
disappeared
behind
the
curtain.
Reclining
far
back
in
a
deep
arm
chair
by
the
bedside,
she
was
withdrawn
from
view.
Caroline
looked
abroad
into
the
chamber;
she
thought
it
empty.
As
her
stray
ideas
returned
slowly,
each
folding
its
weak
wings
on
the
mind's
sad
shore,
like
birds
exhausted,
beholding
void,
and
perceiving
silence
round
her,
she
believed
herself
alone.
Collected
she
was
not
yet;
perhaps
healthy
self
possession
and
self
control
were
to
be
hers
no
more;
perhaps
that
world
the
strong
and
prosperous
live
in
had
already
rolled
from
beneath
her
feet
for
ever.
So,
at
least,
it
often
seemed
to
herself.
In
health
she
had
never
been
accustomed
to
think
aloud,
but
now
words
escaped
her
lips
unawares.
"Oh,
I
should
see
him
once
more
before
all
is
over!
Heaven
might
favour
me
thus
far!"
she
cried.
"God
grant
me
a
little
comfort
before
I
die!"
was
her
humble
petition.
"But
he
will
not
know
I
am
ill
till
I
am
gone,
and
he
will
come
when
they
have
laid
me
out,
and
I
am
senseless,
cold,
and
stiff.
"What
can
my
departed
soul
feel
then?
Can
it
see
or
know
what
happens
to
the
clay?
Can
spirits,
through
any
medium,
communicate
with
living
flesh?
Can
the
dead
at
all
revisit
those
they
leave?
Can
they
come
in
the
elements?
Will
wind,
water,
fire,
lend
me
a
path
to
Moore?
"Is
it
for
nothing
the
wind
sounds
almost
articulately
sometimes
sings
as
I
have
lately
heard
it
sing
at
night
or
passes
the
casement
sobbing,
as
if
for
sorrow
to
come?
Does
nothing,
then,
haunt
it,
nothing
inspire
it?
"Why,
it
suggested
to
