did
perhaps
he
meant
to
speak
to
her;
but
there
was
yet
a
parting
word
to
exchange
with
Miss
Keeldar,
and
while
it
was
being
uttered
Caroline
had
vanished.
Hortense
received
her
former
pupil
with
a
demeanour
of
more
dignity
than
warmth.
She
had
been
seriously
offended
by
Mr.
Helstone's
proceedings,
and
had
all
along
considered
Caroline
to
blame
in
obeying
her
uncle
too
literally.
"You
are
a
very
great
stranger,"
she
said
austerely,
as
her
pupil
held
and
pressed
her
hand.
The
pupil
knew
her
too
well
to
remonstrate
or
complain
of
coldness.
She
let
the
punctilious
whim
pass,
sure
that
her
natural
bonte
(I
use
this
French
word
because
it
expresses
just
what
I
mean
neither
goodness
nor
good
nature,
but
something
between
the
two)
would
presently
get
the
upper
hand.
It
did.
Hortense
had
no
sooner
examined
her
face
well,
and
observed
the
change
its
somewhat
wasted
features
betrayed,
than
her
mien
softened.
Kissing
her
on
both
cheeks,
she
asked
anxiously
after
her
health.
Caroline
answered
gaily.
It
would,
however,
have
been
her
lot
to
undergo
a
long
cross
examination,
followed
by
an
endless
lecture
on
this
head,
had
not
Miss
Mann
called
off
the
attention
of
the
questioner
by
requesting
to
be
conducted
home.
The
poor
invalid
was
already
fatigued.
Her
weariness
made
her
cross
too
cross
almost
to
speak
to
Caroline;
and
besides,
that
young
person's
white
dress
and
lively
look
were
displeasing
in
the
eyes
of
Miss
Mann.
The
everyday
garb
of
brown
stuff
or
gray
gingham,
and
the
everyday
air
of
melancholy,
suited
the
solitary
spinster
better;
she
would
hardly
know
her
young
friend
to
night,
and
quitted
her
with
a
cool
nod.
Hortense
having
promised
to
accompany
her
home,
they
departed
together.
Caroline
now
looked
round
for
Shirley.
She
saw
the
rainbow
scarf
and
purple
dress
in
the
centre
of
a
throng
of
ladies,
all
well
known
to
herself,
but
all
of
the
order
whom
she
systematically
avoided
whenever
avoidance
was
possible.
Shyer
at
some
moments
than
at
others,
she
felt
just
now
no
courage
at
all
to
join
this
company.
She
could
not,
however,
stand
alone
where
all
others
went
in
pairs
or
parties;
so
she
approached
a
group
of
her
own
scholars,
great
girls,
or
rather
young
women,
who
were
standing
watching
some
hundreds
of
the
younger
children
playing
at
blind
man's
buff.
Miss
Helstone
knew
these
girls
liked
her,
yet
she
was
shy
even
with
them
out
of
school.
They
were
not
more
in
awe
of
her
than
she
of
them.
She
drew
near
them
now,
rather
to
find
protection
in
their
company
than
to
patronize
them
with
her
presence.
By
some
instinct
they
knew
her
weakness,
and
with
natural
politeness
they
respected
it.
Her
knowledge
commanded
their
esteem
when
she
taught
them;
her
gentleness
attracted
their
regard;
and
because
she
was
what
they
considered
wise
and
good
when
on
duty,
they
kindly
overlooked
her
evident
timidity
when
off.
They
did
not
take
advantage
of
it.
Peasant
girls
as
they
were,
they
had
too
much
of
our
own
English
sensibility
to
be
guilty
of
the
coarse
error.
They
stood
round
her
still,
civil,
friendly,
receiving
her
slight
smiles
and
rather
hurried
efforts
to
converse
with
a
good
feeling
and
good
breeding
the
last
quality
being
the
result
of
the
first
which
soon
set
her
at
her
ease.
Mr.
Sam
Wynne
coming
up
with
great
haste,
to
insist
on
the
elder
girls
joining
in
the
game
as
well
as
the
younger
ones,
Caroline
was
again
left
alone.
She
was
meditating
a
quiet
retreat
to
the
house,
when
Shirley,
perceiving
from
afar
her
isolation,
hastened
to
her
side.
"Let
us
go
to
the
top
of
the
fields,"
she
said.
"I
know
you
don't
like
crowds,
Caroline."
"But
it
will
be
depriving
you
of
a
pleasure,
Shirley,
to
take
you
from
all
these
fine
people,
who
court
your
society
so
assiduously,
and
to
whom
you
can,
without
art
or
effort,
make
yourself
so
pleasant."
"Not
quite
without
effort;
I
am
already
tired
of
the
exertion.
It
is
but
insipid,
barren
work,
talking
and
laughing
with
the
good
gentlefolks
of
Briarfield.
I
have
been
looking
out
for
your
white
dress
for
the
last
ten
minutes.
I
like
to
watch
those
I
love
in
a
crowd,
and
to
compare
them
with
others.
I
have
thus
compared
you.
You
resemble
none
of
the
rest,
Lina.
There
are
some
prettier
faces
than
yours
here.
You
are
not
a
model
beauty
like
Harriet
Sykes,
for
instance
beside
her
your
person
appears
almost
insignificant
but
you
look
agreeable,
you
look
reflective,
you
look
what
I
call
interesting."
"Hush,
Shirley!
you
flatter
me."
"I
don't
wonder
that
your
scholars
like
you."
"Nonsense,
Shirley!
Talk
of
something
else."
"We
will
talk
of
Moore,
then,
and
we
will
watch
him.
I
see
him
even
now."
"Where?"
And
as
Caroline
asked
the
question
she
looked
not
over
the
fields,
but
into
Miss
Keeldar's
eyes,
as
was
her
wont
whenever
Shirley
mentioned
any
object
she
descried
afar.
Her
friend
had
quicker
vision
than
herself,
and
Caroline
seemed
to
think
that
the
secret
of
her
eagle
acuteness
might
be
read
in
her
dark
gray
irides,
or
rather,
perhaps,
she
only
sought
guidance
by
the
direction
of
those
discriminating
and
brilliant
spheres.
"There
is
Moore,"
said
Shirley,
pointing
right
across
the
wide
field
where
a
thousand
children
were
playing,
and
now
nearly
a
thousand
adult
spectators
walking
about.
"There
can
you
miss
the
tall
stature
and
straight
port?
He
looks
amidst
the
set
that
surround
him
like
Eliab
amongst
humbler
shepherds
like
Saul
in
a
war
council;
and
a
war
council
it
is,
if
I
am
not
mistaken."
"Why
so,
Shirley?"
asked
Caroline,
whose
eye
had
at
last
caught
the
object
it
sought.
"Robert
is
just
now
speaking
to
my
uncle,
and
they
are
shaking
hands.
They
are
then
reconciled."
"Reconciled
not
without
good
reason,
depend
on
it
making
common
cause
against
some
common
foe.
And
why,
think
you,
are
Messrs.
Wynne
and
Sykes,
and
