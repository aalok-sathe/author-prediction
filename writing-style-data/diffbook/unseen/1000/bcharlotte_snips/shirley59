seen
their
eyes
meet
once
only
once.
Some
natures
would
have
taken
pleasure
in
the
glance
then
surprised,
because
there
was
no
harm
and
some
delight
in
it.
It
was
by
no
means
a
glance
of
mutual
intelligence,
for
mutual
love
secrets
existed
not
between
them.
There
was
nothing
then
of
craft
and
concealment
to
offend:
only
Mr.
Moore's
eyes,
looking
into
Caroline's,
felt
they
were
clear
and
gentle;
and
Caroline's
eyes,
encountering
Mr.
Moore's,
confessed
they
were
manly
and
searching.
Each
acknowledged
the
charm
in
his
or
her
own
way.
Moore
smiled
slightly,
and
Caroline
coloured
as
slightly.
Mr.
Helstone
could,
on
the
spot,
have
rated
them
both.
They
annoyed
him.
Why?
Impossible
to
say.
If
you
had
asked
him
what
Moore
merited
at
that
moment,
he
would
have
said
a
"horsewhip;"
if
you
had
inquired
into
Caroline's
deserts,
he
would
have
adjudged
her
a
box
on
the
ear;
if
you
had
further
demanded
the
reason
of
such
chastisements,
he
would
have
stormed
against
flirtation
and
love
making,
and
vowed
he
would
have
no
such
folly
going
on
under
his
roof.
These
private
considerations,
combined
with
political
reasons,
fixed
his
resolution
of
separating
the
cousins.
He
announced
his
will
to
Caroline
one
evening
as
she
was
sitting
at
work
near
the
drawing
room
window.
Her
face
was
turned
towards
him,
and
the
light
fell
full
upon
it.
It
had
struck
him
a
few
minutes
before
that
she
was
looking
paler
and
quieter
than
she
used
to
look.
It
had
not
escaped
him
either
that
Robert
Moore's
name
had
never,
for
some
three
weeks
past,
dropped
from
her
lips;
nor
during
the
same
space
of
time
had
that
personage
made
his
appearance
at
the
rectory.
Some
suspicion
of
clandestine
meetings
haunted
his
mind.
Having
but
an
indifferent
opinion
of
women,
he
always
suspected
them.
He
thought
they
needed
constant
watching.
It
was
in
a
tone
dryly
significant
he
desired
her
to
cease
her
daily
visits
to
the
Hollow.
He
expected
a
start,
a
look
of
depreciation.
The
start
he
saw,
but
it
was
a
very
slight
one;
no
look
whatever
was
directed
to
him.
"Do
you
hear
me?"
he
asked.
"Yes,
uncle."
"Of
course
you
mean
to
attend
to
what
I
say?"
"Yes,
certainly."
"And
there
must
be
no
letter
scribbling
to
your
cousin
Hortense
no
intercourse
whatever.
I
do
not
approve
of
the
principles
of
the
family.
They
are
Jacobinical."
"Very
well,"
said
Caroline
quietly.
She
acquiesced
then.
There
was
no
vexed
flushing
of
the
face,
no
gathering
tears;
the
shadowy
thoughtfulness
which
had
covered
her
features
ere
Mr.
Helstone
spoke
remained
undisturbed;
she
was
obedient.
Yes,
perfectly;
because
the
mandate
coincided
with
her
own
previous
judgment;
because
it
was
now
become
pain
to
her
to
go
to
Hollow's
Cottage;
nothing
met
her
there
but
disappointment.
Hope
and
love
had
quitted
that
little
tenement,
for
Robert
seemed
to
have
deserted
its
precincts.
Whenever
she
asked
after
him
which
she
very
seldom
did,
since
the
mere
utterance
of
his
name
made
her
face
grow
hot
the
answer
was,
he
was
from
home,
or
he
was
quite
taken
up
with
business.
Hortense
feared
he
was
killing
himself
by
application.
He
scarcely
ever
took
a
meal
in
the
house;
he
lived
in
the
counting
house.
At
church
only
Caroline
had
the
chance
of
seeing
him,
and
there
she
rarely
looked
at
him.
It
was
both
too
much
pain
and
too
much
pleasure
to
look
it
excited
too
much
emotion;
and
that
it
was
all
wasted
emotion
she
had
learned
well
to
comprehend.
Once,
on
a
dark,
wet
Sunday,
when
there
were
few
people
at
church,
and
when
especially
certain
ladies
were
absent,
of
whose
observant
faculties
and
tomahawk
tongues
Caroline
stood
in
awe,
she
had
allowed
her
eye
to
seek
Robert's
pew,
and
to
rest
awhile
on
its
occupant.
He
was
there
alone.
Hortense
had
been
kept
at
home
by
prudent
considerations
relative
to
the
rain
and
a
new
spring
chapeau.
During
the
sermon
he
sat
with
folded
arms
and
eyes
cast
down,
looking
very
sad
and
abstracted.
When
depressed,
the
very
hue
of
his
face
seemed
more
dusk
than
when
he
smiled,
and
to
day
cheek
and
forehead
wore
their
most
tintless
and
sober
olive.
By
instinct
Caroline
knew,
as
she
examined
that
clouded
countenance,
that
his
thoughts
were
running
in
no
familiar
or
kindly
channel;
that
they
were
far
away,
not
merely
from
her,
but
from
all
which
she
could
comprehend,
or
in
which
she
could
sympathize.
Nothing
that
they
had
ever
talked
of
together
was
now
in
his
mind:
he
was
wrapt
from
her
by
interests
and
responsibilities
in
which
it
was
deemed
such
as
she
could
have
no
part.
Caroline
meditated
in
her
own
way
on
the
subject;
speculated
on
his
feelings,
on
his
life,
on
his
fears,
on
his
fate;
mused
over
the
mystery
of
"business,"
tried
to
comprehend
more
about
it
than
had
ever
been
told
her
to
understand
its
perplexities,
liabilities,
duties,
exactions;
endeavoured
to
realize
the
state
of
mind
of
a
"man
of
business,"
to
enter
into
it,
feel
what
he
would
feel,
aspire
to
what
he
would
aspire.
Her
earnest
wish
was
to
see
things
as
they
were,
and
not
to
be
romantic.
By
dint
of
effort
she
contrived
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
light
of
truth
here
and
there,
and
hoped
that
scant
ray
might
suffice
to
guide
her.
"Different,
indeed,"
she
concluded,
"is
Robert's
mental
condition
to
mine.
I
think
only
of
him;
he
has
no
room,
no
leisure,
to
think
of
me.
The
feeling
called
love
is
and
has
been
for
two
years
the
predominant
emotion
of
my
heart
always
there,
always
awake,
always
astir.
Quite
other
feelings
absorb
his
reflections
and
govern
his
faculties.
He
is
rising
now,
going
to
leave
the
church,
for
service
is
over.
Will
he
turn
his
head
towards
this
pew?
No,
not
once.
He
has
not
one
look
for
me.
That
is
hard.
A
kind
glance
would
have
made
me
happy
till
to
