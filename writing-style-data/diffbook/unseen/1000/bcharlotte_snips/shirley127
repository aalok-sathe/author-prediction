to
be?"
"The
wedding."
"Whose
wedding?"
"Only
that
of
Robert
Gerard
Moore,
Esq.,
of
Hollow's
Cottage,
with
Miss
Keeldar,
daughter
and
heiress
of
the
late
Charles
Cave
Keeldar
of
Fieldhead
Hall."
Shirley
gazed
at
the
questioner
with
rising
colour.
But
the
light
in
her
eye
was
not
faltering;
it
shone
steadily
yes,
it
burned
deeply.
"That
is
your
revenge,"
she
said
slowly;
then
added,
"Would
it
be
a
bad
match,
unworthy
of
the
late
Charles
Cave
Keeldar's
representative?"
"My
lass,
Moore
is
a
gentleman;
his
blood
is
pure
and
ancient
as
mine
or
thine."
"And
we
two
set
store
by
ancient
blood?
We
have
family
pride,
though
one
of
us
at
least
is
a
republican?"
Yorke
bowed
as
he
stood
before
her.
His
lips
were
mute,
but
his
eye
confessed
the
impeachment.
Yes,
he
had
family
pride;
you
saw
it
in
his
whole
bearing.
"Moore
is
a
gentleman,"
echoed
Shirley,
lifting
her
head
with
glad
grace.
She
checked
herself.
Words
seemed
crowding
to
her
tongue.
She
would
not
give
them
utterance;
but
her
look
spoke
much
at
the
moment.
What,
Yorke
tried
to
read,
but
could
not.
The
language
was
there,
visible,
but
untranslatable
a
poem,
a
fervid
lyric,
in
an
unknown
tongue.
It
was
not
a
plain
story,
however,
no
simple
gush
of
feeling,
no
ordinary
love
confession
that
was
obvious.
It
was
something
other,
deeper,
more
intricate
than
he
guessed
at.
He
felt
his
revenge
had
not
struck
home.
He
felt
that
Shirley
triumphed.
She
held
him
at
fault,
baffled,
puzzled.
She
enjoyed
the
moment,
not
he.
"And
if
Moore
is
a
gentleman,
you
can
be
only
a
lady;
therefore
"
"Therefore
there
would
be
no
inequality
in
our
union."
"None."
"Thank
you
for
your
approbation.
Will
you
give
me
away
when
I
relinquish
the
name
of
Keeldar
for
that
of
Moore?"
Mr.
Yorke,
instead
of
replying,
gazed
at
her
much
puzzled.
He
could
not
divine
what
her
look
signified
whether
she
spoke
in
earnest
or
in
jest.
There
were
purpose
and
feeling,
banter
and
scoff,
playing,
mingled,
on
her
mobile
lineaments.
"I
don't
understand
thee,"
he
said,
turning
away.
She
laughed.
"Take
courage,
sir;
you
are
not
singular
in
your
ignorance.
But
I
suppose
if
Moore
understands
me
that
will
do,
will
it
not?"
"Moore
may
settle
his
own
matters
henceforward
for
me;
I'll
neither
meddle
nor
make
with
them
further."
A
new
thought
crossed
her.
Her
countenance
changed
magically.
With
a
sudden
darkening
of
the
eye
and
austere
fixing
of
the
features
she
demanded,
"Have
you
been
asked
to
interfere?
Are
you
questioning
me
as
another's
proxy?"
"The
Lord
save
us!
Whoever
weds
thee
must
look
about
him!
Keep
all
your
questions
for
Robert;
I'll
answer
no
more
on
'em.
Good
day,
lassie!"
The
day
being
fine,
or
at
least
fair
for
soft
clouds
curtained
the
sun,
and
a
dim
but
not
chill
or
waterish
haze
slept
blue
on
the
hills
Caroline,
while
Shirley
was
engaged
with
her
callers,
had
persuaded
Mrs.
Pryor
to
assume
her
bonnet
and
summer
shawl,
and
to
take
a
walk
with
her
up
towards
the
narrow
end
of
the
Hollow.
Here
the
opposing
sides
of
the
glen,
approaching
each
other
and
becoming
clothed
with
brushwood
and
stunted
oaks,
formed
a
wooded
ravine,
at
the
bottom
of
which
ran
the
mill
stream,
in
broken,
unquiet
course,
struggling
with
many
stones,
chafing
against
rugged
banks,
fretting
with
gnarled
tree
roots,
foaming,
gurgling,
battling
as
it
went.
Here,
when
you
had
wandered
half
a
mile
from
the
mill,
you
found
a
sense
of
deep
solitude
found
it
in
the
shade
of
unmolested
trees,
received
it
in
the
singing
of
many
birds,
for
which
that
shade
made
a
home.
This
was
no
trodden
way.
The
freshness
of
the
wood
flowers
attested
that
foot
of
man
seldom
pressed
them;
the
abounding
wild
roses
looked
as
if
they
budded,
bloomed,
and
faded
under
the
watch
of
solitude,
as
if
in
a
sultan's
harem.
Here
you
saw
the
sweet
azure
of
blue
bells,
and
recognized
in
pearl
white
blossoms,
spangling
the
grass,
a
humble
type
of
some
starlit
spot
in
space.
Mrs.
Pryor
liked
a
quiet
walk.
She
ever
shunned
high
roads,
and
sought
byways
and
lonely
lanes.
One
companion
she
preferred
to
total
solitude,
for
in
solitude
she
was
nervous;
a
vague
fear
of
annoying
encounters
broke
the
enjoyment
of
quite
lonely
rambles.
But
she
feared
nothing
with
Caroline.
When
once
she
got
away
from
human
habitations,
and
entered
the
still
demesne
of
nature
accompanied
by
this
one
youthful
friend,
a
propitious
change
seemed
to
steal
over
her
mind
and
beam
in
her
countenance.
When
with
Caroline
and
Caroline
only
her
heart,
you
would
have
said,
shook
off
a
burden,
her
brow
put
aside
a
veil,
her
spirits
too
escaped
from
a
restraint.
With
her
she
was
cheerful;
with
her,
at
times,
she
was
tender;
to
her
she
would
impart
her
knowledge,
reveal
glimpses
of
her
experience,
give
her
opportunities
for
guessing
what
life
she
had
lived,
what
cultivation
her
mind
had
received,
of
what
calibre
was
her
intelligence,
how
and
where
her
feelings
were
vulnerable.
To
day,
for
instance,
as
they
walked
along,
Mrs.
Pryor
talked
to
her
companion
about
the
various
birds
singing
in
the
trees,
discriminated
their
species,
and
said
something
about
their
habits
and
peculiarities.
English
natural
history
seemed
familiar
to
her.
All
the
wild
flowers
round
their
path
were
recognized
by
her;
tiny
plants
springing
near
stones
and
peeping
out
of
chinks
in
old
walls
plants
such
as
Caroline
had
scarcely
noticed
before
received
a
name
and
an
intimation
of
their
properties.
It
appeared
that
she
had
minutely
studied
the
botany
of
English
fields
and
woods.
Having
reached
the
head
of
the
ravine,
they
sat
down
together
on
a
ledge
of
gray
and
mossy
rock
jutting
from
the
base
of
a
steep
green
hill
which
towered
above
them.
She
looked
round
her,
and
spoke
of
the
neighbourhood
as
she
had
once
before
seen
it
long
ago.
She
alluded
to
its
changes,
and
