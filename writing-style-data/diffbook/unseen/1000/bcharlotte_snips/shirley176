to
it
all
mute,
but
majestic.
"Since
that
day
I
called
S.
to
me
in
the
schoolroom,
and
she
came
and
sat
so
near
my
side;
since
she
opened
the
trouble
of
her
mind
to
me,
asked
my
protection,
appealed
to
my
strength
since
that
hour
I
abhor
Solitude.
Cold
abstraction,
fleshless
skeleton,
daughter,
mother,
and
mate
of
Death!
"It
is
pleasant
to
write
about
what
is
near
and
dear
as
the
core
of
my
heart.
None
can
deprive
me
of
this
little
book,
and
through
this
pencil
I
can
say
to
it
what
I
will
say
what
I
dare
utter
to
nothing
living
say
what
I
dare
not
think
aloud.
"We
have
scarcely
encountered
each
other
since
that
evening.
Once,
when
I
was
alone
in
the
drawing
room,
seeking
a
book
of
Henry's,
she
entered,
dressed
for
a
concert
at
Stilbro'.
Shyness
her
shyness,
not
mine
drew
a
silver
veil
between
us.
Much
cant
have
I
heard
and
read
about
'maiden
modesty,'
but,
properly
used,
and
not
hackneyed,
the
words
are
good
and
appropriate
words.
As
she
passed
to
the
window,
after
tacitly
but
gracefully
recognizing
me,
I
could
call
her
nothing
in
my
own
mind
save
'stainless
virgin.'
To
my
perception,
a
delicate
splendour
robed
her,
and
the
modesty
of
girlhood
was
her
halo.
I
may
be
the
most
fatuous,
as
I
am
one
of
the
plainest,
of
men,
but
in
truth
that
shyness
of
hers
touched
me
exquisitely;
it
flattered
my
finest
sensations.
I
looked
a
stupid
block,
I
dare
say.
I
was
alive
with
a
life
of
Paradise,
as
she
turned
her
glance
from
my
glance,
and
softly
averted
her
head
to
hide
the
suffusion
of
her
cheek.
"I
know
this
is
the
talk
of
a
dreamer
of
a
rapt,
romantic
lunatic.
I
do
dream.
I
will
dream
now
and
then;
and
if
she
has
inspired
romance
into
my
prosaic
composition,
how
can
I
help
it?
"What
a
child
she
is
sometimes!
What
an
unsophisticated,
untaught
thing!
I
see
her
now
looking
up
into
my
face,
and
entreating
me
to
prevent
them
from
smothering
her,
and
to
be
sure
and
give
her
a
strong
narcotic.
I
see
her
confessing
that
she
was
not
so
self
sufficing,
so
independent
of
sympathy,
as
people
thought.
I
see
the
secret
tear
drop
quietly
from
her
eyelash.
She
said
I
thought
her
childish,
and
I
did.
She
imagined
I
despised
her.
Despised
her!
It
was
unutterably
sweet
to
feel
myself
at
once
near
her
and
above
her
to
be
conscious
of
a
natural
right
and
power
to
sustain
her,
as
a
husband
should
sustain
his
wife.
"I
worship
her
perfections;
but
it
is
her
faults,
or
at
least
her
foibles,
that
bring
her
near
to
me,
that
nestle
her
to
my
heart,
that
fold
her
about
with
my
love,
and
that
for
a
most
selfish
but
deeply
natural
reason.
These
faults
are
the
steps
by
which
I
mount
to
ascendency
over
her.
If
she
rose
a
trimmed,
artificial
mound,
without
inequality,
what
vantage
would
she
offer
the
foot?
It
is
the
natural
hill,
with
its
mossy
breaks
and
hollows,
whose
slope
invites
ascent,
whose
summit
it
is
pleasure
to
gain.
"To
leave
metaphor.
It
delights
my
eye
to
look
on
her.
She
suits
me.
If
I
were
a
king
and
she
the
housemaid
that
swept
my
palace
stairs,
across
all
that
space
between
us
my
eye
would
recognize
her
qualities;
a
true
pulse
would
beat
for
her
in
my
heart,
though
an
unspanned
gulf
made
acquaintance
impossible.
If
I
were
a
gentleman,
and
she
waited
on
me
as
a
servant,
I
could
not
help
liking
that
Shirley.
Take
from
her
her
education;
take
her
ornaments,
her
sumptuous
dress,
all
extrinsic
advantages;
take
all
grace,
but
such
as
the
symmetry
of
her
form
renders
inevitable;
present
her
to
me
at
a
cottage
door,
in
a
stuff
gown;
let
her
offer
me
there
a
draught
of
water,
with
that
smile,
with
that
warm
good
will
with
which
she
now
dispenses
manorial
hospitality
I
should
like
her.
I
should
wish
to
stay
an
hour;
I
should
linger
to
talk
with
that
rustic.
I
should
not
feel
as
I
now
do;
I
should
find
in
her
nothing
divine;
but
whenever
I
met
the
young
peasant,
it
would
be
with
pleasure;
whenever
I
left
her,
it
would
be
with
regret.
"How
culpably
careless
in
her
to
leave
her
desk
open,
where
I
know
she
has
money!
In
the
lock
hang
the
keys
of
all
her
repositories,
of
her
very
jewel
casket.
There
is
a
purse
in
that
little
satin
bag;
I
see
the
tassel
of
silver
beads
hanging
out.
That
spectacle
would
provoke
my
brother
Robert.
All
her
little
failings
would,
I
know,
be
a
source
of
irritation
to
him.
If
they
vex
me
it
is
a
most
pleasurable
vexation.
I
delight
to
find
her
at
fault;
and
were
I
always
resident
with
her,
I
am
aware
she
would
be
no
niggard
in
thus
ministering
to
my
enjoyment.
She
would
just
give
me
something
to
do,
to
rectify
a
theme
for
my
tutor
lectures.
I
never
lecture
Henry,
never
feel
disposed
to
do
so.
If
he
does
wrong
and
that
is
very
seldom,
dear,
excellent
lad!
a
word
suffices.
Often
I
do
no
more
than
shake
my
head.
But
the
moment
her
minois
mutin
meets
my
eye,
expostulatory
words
crowd
to
my
lips.
From
a
taciturn
man
I
believe
she
would
transform
me
into
a
talker.
Whence
comes
the
delight
I
take
in
that
talk?
It
puzzles
myself
sometimes.
The
more
crane,
malin,
taquin
is
her
mood,
consequently
the
clearer
occasion
she
gives
me
for
disapprobation,
the
more
I
seek
her,
the
better
I
like
her.
She
is
never
wilder
than
when
equipped
in
her
habit
and
hat,
never
less
manageable
than
when
she
and
Zoe
come
in
fiery
from
a
race
with
the
wind
on
the
hills;
and
I
confess
it
to
this
mute
page
I
may
confess
it
I
have
waited
an
hour
