earnest.
Let
us
have
a
confession
of
faith
on
the
spot."
And
he
took
the
heiress's
two
hands
causing
her
to
let
fall
her
whole
cargo
of
flowers
and
seated
her
by
him
on
the
sofa.
"Say
your
creed,"
he
ordered.
"The
Apostles'
Creed?"
"Yes."
She
said
it
like
a
child.
"Now
for
St.
Athanasius's.
That's
the
test!"
"Let
me
gather
up
my
flowers.
Here
is
Tartar
coming;
he
will
tread
upon
them."
Tartar
was
a
rather
large,
strong,
and
fierce
looking
dog,
very
ugly,
being
of
a
breed
between
mastiff
and
bulldog,
who
at
this
moment
entered
through
the
glass
door,
and
posting
directly
to
the
rug,
snuffed
the
fresh
flowers
scattered
there.
He
seemed
to
scorn
them
as
food;
but
probably
thinking
their
velvety
petals
might
be
convenient
as
litter,
he
was
turning
round
preparatory
to
depositing
his
tawny
bulk
upon
them,
when
Miss
Helstone
and
Miss
Keeldar
simultaneously
stooped
to
the
rescue.
"Thank
you,"
said
the
heiress,
as
she
again
held
out
her
little
apron
for
Caroline
to
heap
the
blossoms
into
it.
"Is
this
your
daughter,
Mr.
Helstone?"
she
asked.
"My
niece
Caroline."
Miss
Keeldar
shook
hands
with
her,
and
then
looked
at
her.
Caroline
also
looked
at
her
hostess.
Shirley
Keeldar
(she
had
no
Christian
name
but
Shirley:
her
parents,
who
had
wished
to
have
a
son,
finding
that,
after
eight
years
of
marriage,
Providence
had
granted
them
only
a
daughter,
bestowed
on
her
the
same
masculine
family
cognomen
they
would
have
bestowed
on
a
boy,
if
with
a
boy
they
had
been
blessed)
Shirley
Keeldar
was
no
ugly
heiress.
She
was
agreeable
to
the
eye.
Her
height
and
shape
were
not
unlike
Miss
Helstone's;
perhaps
in
stature
she
might
have
the
advantage
by
an
inch
or
two.
She
was
gracefully
made,
and
her
face,
too,
possessed
a
charm
as
well
described
by
the
word
grace
as
any
other.
It
was
pale
naturally,
but
intelligent,
and
of
varied
expression.
She
was
not
a
blonde,
like
Caroline.
Clear
and
dark
were
the
characteristics
of
her
aspect
as
to
colour.
Her
face
and
brow
were
clear,
her
eyes
of
the
darkest
gray
(no
green
lights
in
them
transparent,
pure,
neutral
gray),
and
her
hair
of
the
darkest
brown.
Her
features
were
distinguished
by
which
I
do
not
mean
that
they
were
high,
bony,
and
Roman,
being
indeed
rather
small
and
slightly
marked
than
otherwise,
but
only
that
they
were,
to
use
a
few
French
words,
"fins,
gracieux,
spirituels"
mobile
they
were
and
speaking;
but
their
changes
were
not
to
be
understood
nor
their
language
interpreted
all
at
once.
She
examined
Caroline
seriously,
inclining
her
head
a
little
to
one
side,
with
a
thoughtful
air.
"You
see
she
is
only
a
feeble
chick,"
observed
Mr.
Helstone.
"She
looks
young
younger
than
I.
How
old
are
you?"
she
inquired
in
a
manner
that
would
have
been
patronizing
if
it
had
not
been
extremely
solemn
and
simple.
"Eighteen
years
and
six
months."
"And
I
am
twenty
one."
She
said
no
more.
She
had
now
placed
her
flowers
on
the
table,
and
was
busied
in
arranging
them.
"And
St.
Athanasius's
Creed?"
urged
the
rector.
"You
believe
it
all,
don't
you?"
"I
can't
remember
it
quite
all.
I
will
give
you
a
nosegay,
Mr.
Helstone,
when
I
have
given
your
niece
one."
She
had
selected
a
little
bouquet
of
one
brilliant
and
two
or
three
delicate
flowers,
relieved
by
a
spray
of
dark
verdure.
She
tied
it
with
silk
from
her
work
box,
and
placed
it
on
Caroline's
lap;
and
then
she
put
her
hands
behind
her,
and
stood
bending
slightly
towards
her
guest,
still
regarding
her,
in
the
attitude
and
with
something
of
the
aspect
of
a
grave
but
gallant
little
cavalier.
This
temporary
expression
of
face
was
aided
by
the
style
in
which
she
wore
her
hair,
parted
on
one
temple,
and
brushed
in
a
glossy
sweep
above
the
forehead,
whence
it
fell
in
curls
that
looked
natural,
so
free
were
their
wavy
undulations.
"Are
you
tired
with
your
walk?"
she
inquired.
"No
not
in
the
least.
It
is
but
a
short
distance
but
a
mile."
"You
look
pale.
Is
she
always
so
pale?"
she
asked,
turning
to
the
rector.
"She
used
to
be
as
rosy
as
the
reddest
of
your
flowers."
"Why
is
she
altered?
What
has
made
her
pale?
Has
she
been
ill?"
"She
tells
me
she
wants
a
change."
"She
ought
to
have
one.
You
ought
to
give
her
one.
You
should
send
her
to
the
sea
coast."
"I
will,
ere
summer
is
over.
Meantime,
I
intend
her
to
make
acquaintance
with
you,
if
you
have
no
objection."
"I
am
sure
Miss
Keeldar
will
have
no
objection,"
here
observed
Mrs.
Pryor.
"I
think
I
may
take
it
upon
me
to
say
that
Miss
Helstone's
frequent
presence
at
Fieldhead
will
be
esteemed
a
favour."
"You
speak
my
sentiments
precisely,
ma'am,"
said
Shirley,
"and
I
thank
you
for
anticipating
me.
Let
me
tell
you,"
she
continued,
turning
again
to
Caroline,
"that
you
also
ought
to
thank
my
governess.
It
is
not
every
one
she
would
welcome
as
she
has
welcomed
you.
You
are
distinguished
more
than
you
think.
This
morning,
as
soon
as
you
are
gone,
I
shall
ask
Mrs.
Pryor's
opinion
of
you.
I
am
apt
to
rely
on
her
judgment
of
character,
for
hitherto
I
have
found
it
wondrous
accurate.
Already
I
foresee
a
favourable
answer
to
my
inquiries.
Do
I
not
guess
rightly,
Mrs.
Pryor?"
"My
dear,
you
said
but
now
you
would
ask
my
opinion
when
Miss
Helstone
was
gone.
I
am
scarcely
likely
to
give
it
in
her
presence."
"No;
and
perhaps
it
will
be
long
enough
before
I
obtain
it.
I
am
sometimes
sadly
tantalized,
Mr.
Helstone,
by
Mrs.
Pryor's
extreme
caution.
Her
judgments
ought
to
be
correct
when
they
come,
for
they
are
often
as
tardy
of
delivery
as
a
Lord
Chancellor's.
On
some
people's
characters
I
cannot
get
her
to
pronounce
a
sentence,
entreat
as
I
may."
Mrs.
Pryor
here
smiled.
