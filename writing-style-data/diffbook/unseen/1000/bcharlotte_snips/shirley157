"You
have
not
forgotten,
then,
Hal?"
"Not
at
all.
We
were
all
scolded
that
day
for
not
coming
down
to
tea
when
called.
I
can
remember
my
tutor
sitting
at
his
easel,
and
you
standing
behind
him,
holding
the
candle,
and
watching
him
draw
the
snowy
cliff,
the
pine,
the
deer
couched
under
it,
and
the
half
moon
hung
above."
"Where
are
his
drawings,
Harry?
Caroline
should
see
them."
"In
his
portfolio.
But
it
is
padlocked;
he
has
the
key."
"Ask
him
for
it
when
he
comes
in."
"You
should
ask
him,
Shirley.
You
are
shy
of
him
now.
You
are
grown
a
proud
lady
to
him;
I
notice
that."
"Shirley,
you
are
a
real
enigma,"
whispered
Caroline
in
her
ear.
"What
queer
discoveries
I
make
day
by
day
now!
I
who
thought
I
had
your
confidence.
Inexplicable
creature!
even
this
boy
reproves
you."
"I
have
forgotten
'auld
lang
syne,'
you
see,
Harry,"
said
Miss
Keeldar,
answering
young
Sympson,
and
not
heeding
Caroline.
"Which
you
never
should
have
done.
You
don't
deserve
to
be
a
man's
morning
star
if
you
have
so
short
a
memory."
"A
man's
morning
star,
indeed!
and
by
'a
man'
is
meant
your
worshipful
self,
I
suppose?
Come,
drink
your
new
milk
while
it
is
warm."
The
young
cripple
rose
and
limped
towards
the
fire;
he
had
left
his
crutch
near
the
mantelpiece.
"My
poor
lame
darling!"
murmured
Shirley,
in
her
softest
voice,
aiding
him.
"Whether
do
you
like
me
or
Mr.
Sam
Wynne
best,
Shirley?"
inquired
the
boy,
as
she
settled
him
in
an
arm
chair.
"O
Harry,
Sam
Wynne
is
my
aversion;
you
are
my
pet."
"Me
or
Mr.
Malone?"
"You
again,
a
thousand
times."
"Yet
they
are
great
whiskered
fellows,
six
feet
high
each."
"Whereas,
as
long
as
you
live,
Harry,
you
will
never
be
anything
more
than
a
little
pale
lameter."
"Yes,
I
know."
"You
need
not
be
sorrowful.
Have
I
not
often
told
you
who
was
almost
as
little,
as
pale,
as
suffering
as
you,
and
yet
potent
as
a
giant
and
brave
as
a
lion?"
"Admiral
Horatio?"
"Admiral
Horatio,
Viscount
Nelson,
and
Duke
of
Bronte;
great
at
heart
as
a
Titan;
gallant
and
heroic
as
all
the
world
and
age
of
chivalry;
leader
of
the
might
of
England;
commander
of
her
strength
on
the
deep;
hurler
of
her
thunder
over
the
flood."
"A
great
man.
But
I
am
not
warlike,
Shirley;
and
yet
my
mind
is
so
restless
I
burn
day
and
night
for
what
I
can
hardly
tell
to
be
to
do
to
suffer,
I
think."
"Harry,
it
is
your
mind,
which
is
stronger
and
older
than
your
frame,
that
troubles
you.
It
is
a
captive;
it
lies
in
physical
bondage.
But
it
will
work
its
own
redemption
yet.
Study
carefully
not
only
books
but
the
world.
You
love
nature;
love
her
without
fear.
Be
patient
wait
the
course
of
time.
You
will
not
be
a
soldier
or
a
sailor,
Henry;
but
if
you
live
you
will
be
listen
to
my
prophecy
you
will
be
an
author,
perhaps
a
poet."
"An
author!
It
is
a
flash
a
flash
of
light
to
me!
I
will
I
will!
I'll
write
a
book
that
I
may
dedicate
it
to
you."
"You
will
write
it
that
you
may
give
your
soul
its
natural
release.
Bless
me!
what
am
I
saying?
more
than
I
understand,
I
believe,
or
can
make
good.
Here,
Hal
here
is
your
toasted
oatcake;
eat
and
live!"
"Willingly!"
here
cried
a
voice
outside
the
open
window.
"I
know
that
fragrance
of
meal
bread.
Miss
Keeldar,
may
I
come
in
and
partake?"
"Mr.
Hall"
it
was
Mr.
Hall,
and
with
him
was
Louis
Moore,
returned
from
their
walk
"there
is
a
proper
luncheon
laid
out
in
the
dining
room
and
there
are
proper
people
seated
round
it.
You
may
join
that
society
and
share
that
fare
if
you
please;
but
if
your
ill
regulated
tastes
lead
you
to
prefer
ill
regulated
proceedings,
step
in
here,
and
do
as
we
do."
"I
approve
the
perfume,
and
therefore
shall
suffer
myself
to
be
led
by
the
nose,"
returned
Mr.
Hall,
who
presently
entered,
accompanied
by
Louis
Moore.
That
gentleman's
eye
fell
on
his
desk,
pillaged.
"Burglars!"
said
he.
"Henry,
you
merit
the
ferule."
"Give
it
to
Shirley
and
Caroline;
they
did
it,"
was
alleged,
with
more
attention
to
effect
than
truth.
"Traitor
and
false
witness!"
cried
both
the
girls.
"We
never
laid
hands
on
a
thing,
except
in
the
spirit
of
laudable
inquiry!"
"Exactly
so,"
said
Moore,
with
his
rare
smile.
"And
what
have
you
ferreted
out,
in
your
'spirit
of
laudable
inquiry'?"
He
perceived
the
inner
drawer
open.
"This
is
empty,"
said
he.
"Who
has
taken
"
"Here,
here!"
Caroline
hastened
to
say,
and
she
restored
the
little
packet
to
its
place.
He
shut
it
up;
he
locked
it
in
with
a
small
key
attached
to
his
watch
guard;
he
restored
the
other
papers
to
order,
closed
the
repository,
and
sat
down
without
further
remark.
"I
thought
you
would
have
scolded
much
more,
sir,"
said
Henry.
"The
girls
deserve
reprimand."
"I
leave
them
to
their
own
consciences."
"It
accuses
them
of
crimes
intended
as
well
as
perpetrated,
sir.
If
I
had
not
been
here,
they
would
have
treated
your
portfolio
as
they
have
done
your
desk;
but
I
told
them
it
was
padlocked."
"And
will
you
have
lunch
with
us?"
here
interposed
Shirley,
addressing
Moore,
and
desirous,
as
it
seemed,
to
turn
the
conversation.
"Certainly,
if
I
may."
"You
will
be
restricted
to
new
milk
and
Yorkshire
oatcake."
"Va
pour
le
lait
frais!"
said
Louis.
"But
for
your
oatcake!"
and
he
made
a
grimace.
"He
cannot
eat
it,"
said
Henry.
"He
thinks
it
is
like
bran,
raised
with
sour
yeast."
"Come,
then;
by
special
dispensation
we
will
allow
him
a
few
cracknels,
but
nothing
less
homely."
The
hostess
rang
the
bell
and
gave
her
frugal
orders,
which
were
presently
executed.
She
herself
measured
out
the
milk,
and
distributed
the
bread
round
the
