moving
mass.
The
rioters
were
assembled
in
front
of
the
closed
yard
gates,
and
a
single
figure
stood
within,
apparently
addressing
them.
The
mill
itself
was
perfectly
black
and
still.
There
was
neither
life,
light,
nor
motion
around
it.
"Surely
he
is
prepared.
Surely
that
is
not
Moore
meeting
them
alone?"
whispered
Shirley.
"It
is.
We
must
go
to
him.
I
will
go
to
him."
"That
you
will
not."
"Why
did
I
come,
then?
I
came
only
for
him.
I
shall
join
him."
"Fortunately
it
is
out
of
your
power.
There
is
no
entrance
to
the
yard."
"There
is
a
small
entrance
at
the
back,
besides
the
gates
in
front.
It
opens
by
a
secret
method
which
I
know.
I
will
try
it."
"Not
with
my
leave."
Miss
Keeldar
clasped
her
round
the
waist
with
both
arms
and
held
her
back.
"Not
one
step
shall
you
stir,"
she
went
on
authoritatively.
"At
this
moment
Moore
would
be
both
shocked
and
embarrassed
if
he
saw
either
you
or
me.
Men
never
want
women
near
them
in
time
of
real
danger."
"I
would
not
trouble
I
would
help
him,"
was
the
reply.
"How?
by
inspiring
him
with
heroism?
Pooh!
these
are
not
the
days
of
chivalry.
It
is
not
a
tilt
at
a
tournament
we
are
going
to
behold,
but
a
struggle
about
money,
and
food,
and
life."
"It
is
natural
that
I
should
be
at
his
side."
"As
queen
of
his
heart?
His
mill
is
his
lady
love,
Cary!
Backed
by
his
factory
and
his
frames,
he
has
all
the
encouragement
he
wants
or
can
know.
It
is
not
for
love
or
beauty,
but
for
ledger
and
broadcloth,
he
is
going
to
break
a
spear.
Don't
be
sentimental;
Robert
is
not
so."
"I
could
help
him;
I
will
seek
him."
"Off
then
I
let
you
go
seek
Moore.
You'll
not
find
him."
She
loosened
her
hold.
Caroline
sped
like
levelled
shaft
from
bent
bow;
after
her
rang
a
jesting,
gibing
laugh.
"Look
well
there
is
no
mistake!"
was
the
warning
given.
But
there
was
a
mistake.
Miss
Helstone
paused,
hesitated,
gazed.
The
figure
had
suddenly
retreated
from
the
gate,
and
was
running
back
hastily
to
the
mill.
"Make
haste,
Lina!"
cried
Shirley;
"meet
him
before
he
enters."
Caroline
slowly
returned.
"It
is
not
Robert,"
she
said.
"It
has
neither
his
height,
form,
nor
bearing."
"I
saw
it
was
not
Robert
when
I
let
you
go.
How
could
you
imagine
it?
It
is
a
shabby
little
figure
of
a
private
soldier;
they
had
posted
him
as
sentinel.
He
is
safe
in
the
mill
now.
I
saw
the
door
open
and
admit
him.
My
mind
grows
easier.
Robert
is
prepared.
Our
warning
would
have
been
superfluous;
and
now
I
am
thankful
we
came
too
late
to
give
it.
It
has
saved
us
the
trouble
of
a
scene.
How
fine
to
have
entered
the
counting
house
toute
eperdue,
and
to
have
found
oneself
in
presence
of
Messrs.
Armitage
and
Ramsden
smoking,
Malone
swaggering,
your
uncle
sneering,
Mr.
Sykes
sipping
a
cordial,
and
Moore
himself
in
his
cold
man
of
business
vein!
I
am
glad
we
missed
it
all."
"I
wonder
if
there
are
many
in
the
mill,
Shirley!"
"Plenty
to
defend
it.
The
soldiers
we
have
twice
seen
to
day
were
going
there,
no
doubt,
and
the
group
we
noticed
surrounding
your
cousin
in
the
fields
will
be
with
him."
"What
are
they
doing
now,
Shirley?
What
is
that
noise?"
"Hatchets
and
crowbars
against
the
yard
gates.
They
are
forcing
them.
Are
you
afraid?"
"No;
but
my
heart
throbs
fast.
I
have
a
difficulty
in
standing.
I
will
sit
down.
Do
you
feel
unmoved?"
"Hardly
that;
but
I
am
glad
I
came.
We
shall
see
what
transpires
with
our
own
eyes.
We
are
here
on
the
spot,
and
none
know
it.
Instead
of
amazing
the
curate,
the
clothier,
and
the
corn
dealer
with
a
romantic
rush
on
the
stage,
we
stand
alone
with
the
friendly
night,
its
mute
stars,
and
these
whispering
trees,
whose
report
our
friends
will
not
come
to
gather."
"Shirley,
Shirley,
the
gates
are
down!
That
crash
was
like
the
felling
of
great
trees.
Now
they
are
pouring
through.
They
will
break
down
the
mill
doors
as
they
have
broken
the
gate.
What
can
Robert
do
against
so
many?
Would
to
God
I
were
a
little
nearer
him
could
hear
him
speak
could
speak
to
him!
With
my
will
my
longing
to
serve
him
I
could
not
be
a
useless
burden
in
his
way;
I
could
be
turned
to
some
account."
"They
come
on!"
cried
Shirley.
"How
steadily
they
march
in!
There
is
discipline
in
their
ranks.
I
will
not
say
there
is
courage
hundreds
against
tens
are
no
proof
of
that
quality
but"
(she
dropped
her
voice)
"there
is
suffering
and
desperation
enough
amongst
them.
These
goads
will
urge
them
forwards."
"Forwards
against
Robert;
and
they
hate
him.
Shirley,
is
there
much
danger
they
will
win
the
day?"
"We
shall
see.
Moore
and
Helstone
are
of
'earth's
first
blood'
no
bunglers
no
cravens
"
A
crash
smash
shiver
stopped
their
whispers.
A
simultaneously
hurled
volley
of
stones
had
saluted
the
broad
front
of
the
mill,
with
all
its
windows;
and
now
every
pane
of
every
lattice
lay
in
shattered
and
pounded
fragments.
A
yell
followed
this
demonstration
a
rioters'
yell
a
north
of
England,
a
Yorkshire,
a
West
Riding,
a
West
Riding
clothing
district
of
Yorkshire
rioters'
yell.
You
never
heard
that
sound,
perhaps,
reader?
So
much
the
better
for
your
ears
perhaps
for
your
heart,
since,
if
it
rends
the
air
in
hate
to
yourself,
or
to
the
men
or
principles
you
approve,
the
interests
to
which
you
wish
well,
wrath
wakens
to
the
cry
of
hate;
the
lion
shakes
his
mane,
and
rises
to
the
howl
of
the
hyena;
caste
stands
up,
ireful
against
caste;
and
the
indignant,
wronged
spirit
of
the
middle
rank
bears
down
in
zeal
and
scorn
on
the
famished
and
furious
mass
of
the
