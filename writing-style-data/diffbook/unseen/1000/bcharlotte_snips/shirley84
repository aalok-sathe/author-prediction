softened
her
eye.
She
raised
her
hand
to
her
chin,
cast
her
gaze
down,
and
seemed
to
think
as
she
waited.
The
servant
announced
Mr.
Moore,
and
Shirley
turned
round
when
Mr.
Moore
appeared
at
the
door.
His
figure
seemed
very
tall
as
he
entered,
and
stood
in
contrast
with
the
three
ladies,
none
of
whom
could
boast
a
stature
much
beyond
the
average.
He
was
looking
well,
better
than
he
had
been
known
to
look
for
the
past
twelve
months.
A
sort
of
renewed
youth
glowed
in
his
eye
and
colour,
and
an
invigorated
hope
and
settled
purpose
sustained
his
bearing.
Firmness
his
countenance
still
indicated,
but
not
austerity.
It
looked
as
cheerful
as
it
was
earnest.
"I
am
just
returned
from
Stilbro',"
he
said
to
Miss
Keeldar,
as
he
greeted
her;
"and
I
thought
I
would
call
to
impart
to
you
the
result
of
my
mission."
"You
did
right
not
to
keep
me
in
suspense,"
she
said,
"and
your
visit
is
well
timed.
Sit
down.
We
have
not
finished
tea.
Are
you
English
enough
to
relish
tea,
or
do
you
faithfully
adhere
to
coffee?"
Moore
accepted
tea.
"I
am
learning
to
be
a
naturalized
Englishman,"
said
he;
"my
foreign
habits
are
leaving
me
one
by
one."
And
now
he
paid
his
respects
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
and
paid
them
well,
with
a
grave
modesty
that
became
his
age
compared
with
hers.
Then
he
looked
at
Caroline
not,
however,
for
the
first
time:
his
glance
had
fallen
upon
her
before.
He
bent
towards
her
as
she
sat,
gave
her
his
hand,
and
asked
her
how
she
was.
The
light
from
the
window
did
not
fall
upon
Miss
Helstone;
her
back
was
turned
towards
it.
A
quiet
though
rather
low
reply,
a
still
demeanour,
and
the
friendly
protection
of
early
twilight
kept
out
of
view
each
traitorous
symptom.
None
could
affirm
that
she
had
trembled
or
blushed,
that
her
heart
had
quaked
or
her
nerves
thrilled;
none
could
prove
emotion;
a
greeting
showing
less
effusion
was
never
interchanged.
Moore
took
the
empty
chair
near
her,
opposite
Miss
Keeldar.
He
had
placed
himself
well.
His
neighbour,
screened
by
the
very
closeness
of
his
vicinage
from
his
scrutiny,
and
sheltered
further
by
the
dusk
which
deepened
each
moment,
soon
regained
not
merely
seeming
but
real
mastery
of
the
feelings
which
had
started
into
insurrection
at
the
first
announcement
of
his
name.
He
addressed
his
conversation
to
Miss
Keeldar.
"I
went
to
the
barracks,"
he
said,
"and
had
an
interview
with
Colonel
Ryde.
He
approved
my
plans,
and
promised
the
aid
I
wanted.
Indeed,
he
offered
a
more
numerous
force
than
I
require
half
a
dozen
will
suffice.
I
don't
intend
to
be
swamped
by
redcoats.
They
are
needed
for
appearance
rather
than
anything
else.
My
main
reliance
is
on
my
own
civilians."
"And
on
their
captain,"
interposed
Shirley.
"What,
Captain
Keeldar?"
inquired
Moore,
slightly
smiling,
and
not
lifting
his
eyes.
The
tone
of
raillery
in
which
he
said
this
was
very
respectful
and
suppressed.
"No,"
returned
Shirley,
answering
the
smile;
"Captain
Gerard
Moore,
who
trusts
much
to
the
prowess
of
his
own
right
arm,
I
believe."
"Furnished
with
his
counting
house
ruler,"
added
Moore.
Resuming
his
usual
gravity,
he
went
on:
"I
received
by
this
evening's
post
a
note
from
the
Home
Secretary
in
answer
to
mine.
It
appears
they
are
uneasy
at
the
state
of
matters
here
in
the
north;
they
especially
condemn
the
supineness
and
pusillanimity
of
the
mill
owners.
They
say,
as
I
have
always
said,
that
inaction,
under
present
circumstances,
is
criminal,
and
that
cowardice
is
cruelty,
since
both
can
only
encourage
disorder,
and
lead
finally
to
sanguinary
outbreaks.
There
is
the
note
I
brought
it
for
your
perusal;
and
there
is
a
batch
of
newspapers,
containing
further
accounts
of
proceedings
in
Nottingham,
Manchester,
and
elsewhere."
He
produced
letters
and
journals,
and
laid
them
before
Miss
Keeldar.
While
she
perused
them
he
took
his
tea
quietly;
but
though
his
tongue
was
still,
his
observant
faculties
seemed
by
no
means
off
duty.
Mrs.
Pryor,
sitting
in
the
background,
did
not
come
within
the
range
of
his
glance,
but
the
two
younger
ladies
had
the
full
benefit
thereof.
Miss
Keeldar,
placed
directly
opposite,
was
seen
without
effort.
She
was
the
object
his
eyes,
when
lifted,
naturally
met
first;
and
as
what
remained
of
daylight
the
gilding
of
the
west
was
upon
her,
her
shape
rose
in
relief
from
the
dark
panelling
behind.
Shirley's
clear
cheek
was
tinted
yet
with
the
colour
which
had
risen
into
it
a
few
minutes
since.
The
dark
lashes
of
her
eyes
looking
down
as
she
read,
the
dusk
yet
delicate
line
of
her
eyebrows,
the
almost
sable
gloss
of
her
curls,
made
her
heightened
complexion
look
fine
as
the
bloom
of
a
red
wild
flower
by
contrast.
There
was
natural
grace
in
her
attitude,
and
there
was
artistic
effect
in
the
ample
and
shining
folds
of
her
silk
dress
an
attire
simply
fashioned,
but
almost
splendid
from
the
shifting
brightness
of
its
dye,
warp
and
woof
being
of
tints
deep
and
changing
as
the
hue
on
a
pheasant's
neck.
A
glancing
bracelet
on
her
arm
produced
the
contrast
of
gold
and
ivory.
There
was
something
brilliant
in
the
whole
picture.
It
is
to
be
supposed
that
Moore
thought
so,
as
his
eye
dwelt
long
on
it,
but
he
seldom
permitted
his
feelings
or
his
opinions
to
exhibit
themselves
in
his
face.
His
temperament
boasted
a
certain
amount
of
phlegm,
and
he
preferred
an
undemonstrative,
not
ungentle,
but
serious
aspect
to
any
other.
He
could
not,
by
looking
straight
before
him,
see
Caroline,
as
she
was
close
at
his
side.
It
was
necessary,
therefore,
to
maneauvre
a
little
to
get
her
well
within
the
range
of
his
observation.
He
leaned
back
in
his
chair,
and
looked
down
on
her.
In
Miss
Helstone
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
could
discover
brilliancy.
Sitting
in
the
shade,
without
flowers
or
ornaments,
her
attire
the
modest
muslin
dress,
colourless
but
