speeches,
recommendation
to
be
careful
of
the
night
air,
etc.
By
degrees
the
throng
dispersed,
the
carriages
drove
off.
Miss
Keeldar
was
just
emerging
from
her
flowery
refuge
when
Mr.
Helstone
entered
the
garden
and
met
her.
"Oh,
I
want
you!"
he
said.
"I
was
afraid
you
were
already
gone.
Caroline,
come
here."
Caroline
came,
expecting,
as
Shirley
did,
a
lecture
on
not
having
been
visible
at
church.
Other
subjects,
however,
occupied
the
rector's
mind.
"I
shall
not
sleep
at
home
to
night,"
he
continued.
"I
have
just
met
with
an
old
friend,
and
promised
to
accompany
him.
I
shall
return
probably
about
noon
to
morrow.
Thomas,
the
clerk,
is
engaged,
and
I
cannot
get
him
to
sleep
in
the
house,
as
I
usually
do
when
I
am
absent
for
a
night.
Now
"
"Now,"
interrupted
Shirley,
"you
want
me
as
a
gentleman
the
first
gentleman
in
Briarfield,
in
short
to
supply
your
place,
be
master
of
the
rectory
and
guardian
of
your
niece
and
maids
while
you
are
away?"
"Exactly,
captain.
I
thought
the
post
would
suit
you.
Will
you
favour
Caroline
so
far
as
to
be
her
guest
for
one
night?
Will
you
stay
here
instead
of
going
back
to
Fieldhead?"
"And
what
will
Mrs.
Pryor
do?
she
expects
me
home."
"I
will
send
her
word.
Come,
make
up
your
mind
to
stay.
It
grows
late;
the
dew
falls
heavily.
You
and
Caroline
will
enjoy
each
other's
society,
I
doubt
not."
"I
promise
you,
then,
to
stay
with
Caroline,"
replied
Shirley.
"As
you
say,
we
shall
enjoy
each
other's
society.
We
will
not
be
separated
to
night.
Now,
rejoin
your
old
friend,
and
fear
nothing
for
us."
"If
there
should
chance
to
be
any
disturbance
in
the
night,
captain;
if
you
should
hear
the
picking
of
a
lock,
the
cutting
out
of
a
pane
of
glass,
a
stealthy
tread
of
steps
about
the
house
(and
I
need
not
fear
to
tell
you,
who
bear
a
well
tempered,
mettlesome
heart
under
your
girl's
ribbon
sash,
that
such
little
incidents
are
very
possible
in
the
present
time),
what
would
you
do?"
"Don't
know;
faint,
perhaps
fall
down,
and
have
to
be
picked
up
again.
But,
doctor,
if
you
assign
me
the
post
of
honour,
you
must
give
me
arms.
What
weapons
are
there
in
your
stronghold?"
"You
could
not
wield
a
sword?"
"No;
I
could
manage
the
carving
knife
better."
"You
will
find
a
good
one
in
the
dining
room
sideboard
a
lady's
knife,
light
to
handle,
and
as
sharp
pointed
as
a
poniard."
"It
will
suit
Caroline.
But
you
must
give
me
a
brace
of
pistols.
I
know
you
have
pistols."
"I
have
two
pairs.
One
pair
I
can
place
at
your
disposal.
You
will
find
them
suspended
over
the
mantelpiece
of
my
study
in
cloth
cases."
"Loaded?"
"Yes,
but
not
on
the
cock.
Cock
them
before
you
go
to
bed.
It
is
paying
you
a
great
compliment,
captain,
to
lend
you
these.
Were
you
one
of
the
awkward
squad
you
should
not
have
them."
"I
will
take
care.
You
need
delay
no
longer,
Mr.
Helstone.
You
may
go
now.
He
is
gracious
to
me
to
lend
me
his
pistols,"
she
remarked,
as
the
rector
passed
out
at
the
garden
gate.
"But
come,
Lina,"
she
continued,
"let
us
go
in
and
have
some
supper.
I
was
too
much
vexed
at
tea
with
the
vicinage
of
Mr.
Sam
Wynne
to
be
able
to
eat,
and
now
I
am
really
hungry."
Entering
the
house,
they
repaired
to
the
darkened
dining
room,
through
the
open
windows
of
which
apartment
stole
the
evening
air,
bearing
the
perfume
of
flowers
from
the
garden,
the
very
distant
sound
of
far
retreating
steps
from
the
road,
and
a
soft,
vague
murmur
whose
origin
Caroline
explained
by
the
remark,
uttered
as
she
stood
listening
at
the
casement,
"Shirley,
I
hear
the
beck
in
the
Hollow."
Then
she
rang
the
bell,
asked
for
a
candle
and
some
bread
and
milk
Miss
Keeldar's
usual
supper
and
her
own.
Fanny,
when
she
brought
in
the
tray,
would
have
closed
the
windows
and
the
shutters,
but
was
requested
to
desist
for
the
present.
The
twilight
was
too
calm,
its
breath
too
balmy
to
be
yet
excluded.
They
took
their
meal
in
silence.
Caroline
rose
once
to
remove
to
the
window
sill
a
glass
of
flowers
which
stood
on
the
sideboard,
the
exhalation
from
the
blossoms
being
somewhat
too
powerful
for
the
sultry
room.
In
returning
she
half
opened
a
drawer,
and
took
from
it
something
that
glittered
clear
and
keen
in
her
hand.
"You
assigned
this
to
me,
then,
Shirley,
did
you?
It
is
bright,
keen
edged,
finely
tapered;
it
is
dangerous
looking.
I
never
yet
felt
the
impulse
which
could
move
me
to
direct
this
against
a
fellow
creature.
It
is
difficult
to
fancy
that
circumstances
could
nerve
my
arm
to
strike
home
with
this
long
knife."
"I
should
hate
to
do
it,"
replied
Shirley,
"but
I
think
I
could
do
it,
if
goaded
by
certain
exigencies
which
I
can
imagine."
And
Miss
Keeldar
quietly
sipped
her
glass
of
new
milk,
looking
somewhat
thoughtful
and
a
little
pale;
though,
indeed,
when
did
she
not
look
pale?
She
was
never
florid.
The
milk
sipped
and
the
bread
eaten,
Fanny
was
again
summoned.
She
and
Eliza
were
recommended
to
go
to
bed,
which
they
were
quite
willing
to
do,
being
weary
of
the
day's
exertions,
of
much
cutting
of
currant
buns,
and
filling
of
urns
and
teapots,
and
running
backwards
and
forwards
with
trays.
Ere
long
the
maids'
chamber
door
was
heard
to
close.
Caroline
took
a
candle
and
went
quietly
all
over
the
house,
seeing
that
every
window
was
fast
and
every
door
barred.
She
did
not
even
evade
the
haunted
back
kitchen
nor
the
vault
like
cellars.
These
visited,
she
returned.
"There
is
neither
spirit
nor
flesh
in
the
house
at
present,"
she
said,
"which
should
not
be
there.
It
is
now
near
eleven
o'clock,
fully
bedtime;
yet
I
would
