which
would
remain
on
Mrs.
Pryor's
mind.
No
effort
of
Shirley's
or
Caroline's
could
efface
it
thence.
She
could
forgive
her
offending
pupil,
not
her
innocent
self.
Miss
Keeldar,
doomed
to
be
in
constant
request
during
the
morning,
was
presently
summoned
downstairs
again.
The
rector
called
first.
A
lively
welcome
and
livelier
reprimand
were
at
his
service.
He
expected
both,
and,
being
in
high
spirits,
took
them
in
equally
good
part.
In
the
course
of
his
brief
visit
he
quite
forgot
to
ask
after
his
niece;
the
riot,
the
rioters,
the
mill,
the
magistrates,
the
heiress,
absorbed
all
his
thoughts
to
the
exclusion
of
family
ties.
He
alluded
to
the
part
himself
and
curate
had
taken
in
the
defence
of
the
Hollow.
"The
vials
of
pharisaical
wrath
will
be
emptied
on
our
heads
for
our
share
in
this
business,"
he
said;
"but
I
defy
every
calumniator.
I
was
there
only
to
support
the
law,
to
play
my
part
as
a
man
and
a
Briton;
which
characters
I
deem
quite
compatible
with
those
of
the
priest
and
Levite,
in
their
highest
sense.
Your
tenant
Moore,"
he
went
on,
"has
won
my
approbation.
A
cooler
commander
I
would
not
wish
to
see,
nor
a
more
determined.
Besides,
the
man
has
shown
sound
judgment
and
good
sense
first,
in
being
thoroughly
prepared
for
the
event
which
has
taken
place;
and
subsequently,
when
his
well
concerted
plans
had
secured
him
success,
in
knowing
how
to
use
without
abusing
his
victory.
Some
of
the
magistrates
are
now
well
frightened,
and,
like
all
cowards,
show
a
tendency
to
be
cruel.
Moore
restrains
them
with
admirable
prudence.
He
has
hitherto
been
very
unpopular
in
the
neighbourhood;
but,
mark
my
words,
the
tide
of
opinion
will
now
take
a
turn
in
his
favour.
People
will
find
out
that
they
have
not
appreciated
him,
and
will
hasten
to
remedy
their
error;
and
he,
when
he
perceives
the
public
disposed
to
acknowledge
his
merits,
will
show
a
more
gracious
mien
than
that
with
which
he
has
hitherto
favoured
us."
Mr.
Helstone
was
about
to
add
to
this
speech
some
half
jesting,
half
serious
warnings
to
Miss
Keeldar
on
the
subject
of
her
rumoured
partiality
for
her
talented
tenant,
when
a
ring
at
the
door,
announcing
another
caller,
checked
his
raillery;
and
as
that
other
caller
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
white
haired
elderly
gentleman,
with
a
rather
truculent
countenance
and
disdainful
eye
in
short,
our
old
acquaintance,
and
the
rector's
old
enemy,
Mr.
Yorke
the
priest
and
Levite
seized
his
hat,
and
with
the
briefest
of
adieus
to
Miss
Keeldar
and
the
sternest
of
nods
to
her
guest
took
an
abrupt
leave.
Mr.
Yorke
was
in
no
mild
mood,
and
in
no
measured
terms
did
he
express
his
opinion
on
the
transaction
of
the
night.
Moore,
the
magistrates,
the
soldiers,
the
mob
leaders,
each
and
all
came
in
for
a
share
of
his
invectives;
but
he
reserved
his
strongest
epithets
and
real
racy
Yorkshire
Doric
adjectives
they
were
for
the
benefit
of
the
fighting
parsons,
the
"sanguinary,
demoniac"
rector
and
curate.
According
to
him,
the
cup
of
ecclesiastical
guilt
was
now
full
indeed.
"The
church,"
he
said,
"was
in
a
bonny
pickle
now.
It
was
time
it
came
down
when
parsons
took
to
swaggering
amang
soldiers,
blazing
away
wi'
bullet
and
gunpowder,
taking
the
lives
of
far
honester
men
than
themselves."
"What
would
Moore
have
done
if
nobody
had
helped
him?"
asked
Shirley.
"Drunk
as
he'd
brewed,
eaten
as
he'd
baked."
"Which
means
you
would
have
left
him
by
himself
to
face
that
mob.
Good!
He
has
plenty
of
courage,
but
the
greatest
amount
of
gallantry
that
ever
garrisoned
one
human
breast
could
scarce
avail
against
two
hundred."
"He
had
the
soldiers,
those
poor
slaves
who
hire
out
their
own
blood
and
spill
other
folk's
for
money."
"You
abuse
soldiers
almost
as
much
as
you
abuse
clergymen.
All
who
wear
red
coats
are
national
refuse
in
your
eyes,
and
all
who
wear
black
are
national
swindlers.
Mr.
Moore,
according
to
you,
did
wrong
to
get
military
aid,
and
he
did
still
worse
to
accept
of
any
other
aid.
Your
way
of
talking
amounts
to
this:
he
should
have
abandoned
his
mill
and
his
life
to
the
rage
of
a
set
of
misguided
madmen,
and
Mr.
Helstone
and
every
other
gentleman
in
the
parish
should
have
looked
on,
and
seen
the
building
razed
and
its
owner
slaughtered,
and
never
stirred
a
finger
to
save
either."
"If
Moore
had
behaved
to
his
men
from
the
beginning
as
a
master
ought
to
behave,
they
never
would
have
entertained
their
present
feelings
towards
him."
"Easy
for
you
to
talk,"
exclaimed
Miss
Keeldar,
who
was
beginning
to
wax
warm
in
her
tenant's
cause
"you,
whose
family
have
lived
at
Briarmains
for
six
generations,
to
whose
person
the
people
have
been
accustomed
for
fifty
years,
who
know
all
their
ways,
prejudices,
and
preferences
easy,
indeed,
for
you
to
act
so
as
to
avoid
offending
them.
But
Mr.
Moore
came
a
stranger
into
the
district;
he
came
here
poor
and
friendless,
with
nothing
but
his
own
energies
to
back
him,
nothing
but
his
honour,
his
talent,
and
his
industry
to
make
his
way
for
him.
A
monstrous
crime
indeed
that,
under
such
circumstances,
he
could
not
popularize
his
naturally
grave,
quiet
manners
all
at
once;
could
not
be
jocular,
and
free,
and
cordial
with
a
strange
peasantry,
as
you
are
with
your
fellow
townsmen!
An
unpardonable
transgression
that
when
he
introduced
improvements
he
did
not
go
about
the
business
in
quite
the
most
politic
way,
did
not
graduate
his
changes
as
delicately
as
a
rich
capitalist
might
have
done!
For
errors
of
this
sort
is
he
to
be
the
victim
of
mob
outrage?
Is
he
to
be
denied
even
the
privilege
of
defending
himself?
Are
those
who
have
the
hearts
of
men
in
their
breasts
(and
Mr.
Helstone,
say
what
you
will
of
him,
has
such
a
heart)
to
be
reviled
like
malefactors
because
they
stand
