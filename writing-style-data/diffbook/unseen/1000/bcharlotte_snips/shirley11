and
reflecting.
An
impatient
trampling
of
one
of
the
horses
made
him
presently
look
up.
His
eye
in
the
moment
caught
the
gleam
of
something
white
attached
to
a
part
of
the
harness.
Examined
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
this
proved
to
be
a
folded
paper
a
billet.
It
bore
no
address
without;
within
was
the
superscription:
"To
the
Divil
of
Hollow's
Miln."
We
will
not
copy
the
rest
of
the
orthography,
which
was
very
peculiar,
but
translate
it
into
legible
English.
It
ran
thus:
"Your
hellish
machinery
is
shivered
to
smash
on
Stilbro'
Moor,
and
your
men
are
lying
bound
hand
and
foot
in
a
ditch
by
the
roadside.
Take
this
as
a
warning
from
men
that
are
starving,
and
have
starving
wives
and
children
to
go
home
to
when
they
have
done
this
deed.
If
you
get
new
machines,
or
if
you
otherwise
go
on
as
you
have
done,
you
shall
hear
from
us
again.
Beware!"
"Hear
from
you
again?
Yes,
I'll
hear
from
you
again,
and
you
shall
hear
from
me.
I'll
speak
to
you
directly.
On
Stilbro'
Moor
you
shall
hear
from
me
in
a
moment."
Having
led
the
wagons
within
the
gates,
he
hastened
towards
the
cottage.
Opening
the
door,
he
spoke
a
few
words
quickly
but
quietly
to
two
females
who
ran
to
meet
him
in
the
passage.
He
calmed
the
seeming
alarm
of
one
by
a
brief
palliative
account
of
what
had
taken
place;
to
the
other
he
said,
"Go
into
the
mill,
Sarah
there
is
the
key
and
ring
the
mill
bell
as
loud
as
you
can.
Afterwards
you
will
get
another
lantern
and
help
me
to
light
up
the
front."
Returning
to
his
horses,
he
unharnessed,
fed,
and
stabled
them
with
equal
speed
and
care,
pausing
occasionally,
while
so
occupied,
as
if
to
listen
for
the
mill
bell.
It
clanged
out
presently,
with
irregular
but
loud
and
alarming
din.
The
hurried,
agitated
peal
seemed
more
urgent
than
if
the
summons
had
been
steadily
given
by
a
practised
hand.
On
that
still
night,
at
that
unusual
hour,
it
was
heard
a
long
way
round.
The
guests
in
the
kitchen
of
the
Redhouse
were
startled
by
the
clamour,
and
declaring
that
"there
must
be
summat
more
nor
common
to
do
at
Hollow's
Miln,"
they
called
for
lanterns,
and
hurried
to
the
spot
in
a
body.
And
scarcely
had
they
thronged
into
the
yard
with
their
gleaming
lights,
when
the
tramp
of
horses
was
heard,
and
a
little
man
in
a
shovel
hat,
sitting
erect
on
the
back
of
a
shaggy
pony,
"rode
lightly
in,"
followed
by
an
aide
de
camp
mounted
on
a
larger
steed.
Mr.
Moore,
meantime,
after
stabling
his
dray
horses,
had
saddled
his
hackney,
and
with
the
aid
of
Sarah,
the
servant,
lit
up
his
mill,
whose
wide
and
long
front
now
glared
one
great
illumination,
throwing
a
sufficient
light
on
the
yard
to
obviate
all
fear
of
confusion
arising
from
obscurity.
Already
a
deep
hum
of
voices
became
audible.
Mr.
Malone
had
at
length
issued
from
the
counting
house,
previously
taking
the
precaution
to
dip
his
head
and
face
in
the
stone
water
jug;
and
this
precaution,
together
with
the
sudden
alarm,
had
nearly
restored
to
him
the
possession
of
those
senses
which
the
punch
had
partially
scattered.
He
stood
with
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head,
and
his
shillelah
grasped
in
his
dexter
fist,
answering
much
at
random
the
questions
of
the
newly
arrived
party
from
the
Redhouse.
Mr.
Moore
now
appeared,
and
was
immediately
confronted
by
the
shovel
hat
and
the
shaggy
pony.
"Well,
Moore,
what
is
your
business
with
us?
I
thought
you
would
want
us
to
night
me
and
the
hetman
here
(patting
his
pony's
neck),
and
Tom
and
his
charger.
When
I
heard
your
mill
bell
I
could
sit
still
no
longer,
so
I
left
Boultby
to
finish
his
supper
alone.
But
where
is
the
enemy?
I
do
not
see
a
mask
or
a
smutted
face
present;
and
there
is
not
a
pane
of
glass
broken
in
your
windows.
Have
you
had
an
attack,
or
do
you
expect
one?"
"Oh,
not
at
all!
I
have
neither
had
one
nor
expect
one,"
answered
Moore
coolly.
"I
only
ordered
the
bell
to
be
rung
because
I
want
two
or
three
neighbours
to
stay
here
in
the
Hollow
while
I
and
a
couple
or
so
more
go
over
to
Stilbro'
Moor."
"To
Stilbro'
Moor!
What
to
do?
To
meet
the
wagons?"
"The
wagons
are
come
home
an
hour
ago."
"Then
all's
right.
What
more
would
you
have?"
"They
came
home
empty;
and
Joe
Scott
and
company
are
left
on
the
moor,
and
so
are
the
frames.
Read
that
scrawl."
Mr.
Helstone
received
and
perused
the
document
of
which
the
contents
have
before
been
given.
"Hum!
They've
only
served
you
as
they
serve
others.
But,
however,
the
poor
fellows
in
the
ditch
will
be
expecting
help
with
some
impatience.
This
is
a
wet
night
for
such
a
berth.
I
and
Tom
will
go
with
you.
Malone
may
stay
behind
and
take
care
of
the
mill.
What
is
the
matter
with
him?
His
eyes
seem
starting
out
of
his
head."
"He
has
been
eating
a
mutton
chop."
"Indeed!
Peter
Augustus,
be
on
your
guard.
Eat
no
more
mutton
chops
to
night.
You
are
left
here
in
command
of
these
premises
an
honourable
post!"
"Is
anybody
to
stay
with
me?"
"As
many
of
the
present
assemblage
as
choose.
My
lads,
how
many
of
you
will
remain
here,
and
how
many
will
go
a
little
way
with
me
and
Mr.
Moore
on
the
Stilbro'
road,
to
meet
some
men
who
have
been
waylaid
and
assaulted
by
frame
breakers?"
The
small
number
of
three
volunteered
to
go;
the
rest
preferred
staying
behind.
As
Mr.
Moore
mounted
his
horse,
the
rector
asked
him
in
a
low
voice
whether
he
had
locked
up
the
mutton
chops,
so
that
Peter
Augustus
could
not
get
at
them?
The
manufacturer
nodded
an
affirmative,
and
