learned
then?
What
new
circumstance?"
"I
have
learned
that
she
has
just
made
her
will."
"Made
her
will?"
The
tutor
and
pupil
were
silent.
"She
told
you
that?"
asked
Moore,
when
some
minutes
had
elapsed.
"She
told
me
quite
cheerfully,
not
as
an
ominous
circumstance,
which
I
felt
it
to
be.
She
said
I
was
the
only
person
besides
her
solicitor,
Pearson
Hall,
and
Mr.
Helstone
and
Mr.
Yorke,
who
knew
anything
about
it;
and
to
me,
she
intimated,
she
wished
specially
to
explain
its
provisions."
"Go
on,
Harry."
"'Because,'
she
said,
looking
down
on
me
with
her
beautiful
eyes
oh!
they
are
beautiful,
Mr.
Moore!
I
love
them!
I
love
her!
She
is
my
star!
Heaven
must
not
claim
her!
She
is
lovely
in
this
world,
and
fitted
for
this
world.
Shirley
is
not
an
angel;
she
is
a
woman,
and
she
shall
live
with
men.
Seraphs
shall
not
have
her!
Mr.
Moore,
if
one
of
the
'sons
of
God,'
with
wings
wide
and
bright
as
the
sky,
blue
and
sounding
as
the
sea,
having
seen
that
she
was
fair,
descended
to
claim
her,
his
claim
should
be
withstood
withstood
by
me
boy
and
cripple
as
I
am."
"Henry
Sympson,
go
on,
when
I
tell
you."
"'Because,'
she
said,
'if
I
made
no
will,
and
died
before
you,
Harry,
all
my
property
would
go
to
you;
and
I
do
not
intend
that
it
should
be
so,
though
your
father
would
like
it.
But
you,'
she
said,
'will
have
his
whole
estate,
which
is
large
larger
than
Fieldhead.
Your
sisters
will
have
nothing;
so
I
have
left
them
some
money,
though
I
do
not
love
them,
both
together,
half
so
much
as
I
love
one
lock
of
your
fair
hair.'
She
said
these
words,
and
she
called
me
her
'darling,'
and
let
me
kiss
her.
She
went
on
to
tell
me
that
she
had
left
Caroline
Helstone
some
money
too;
that
this
manor
house,
with
its
furniture
and
books,
she
had
bequeathed
to
me,
as
she
did
not
choose
to
take
the
old
family
place
from
her
own
blood;
and
that
all
the
rest
of
her
property,
amounting
to
about
twelve
thousand
pounds,
exclusive
of
the
legacies
to
my
sisters
and
Miss
Helstone,
she
had
willed,
not
to
me,
seeing
I
was
already
rich,
but
to
a
good
man,
who
would
make
the
best
use
of
it
that
any
human
being
could
do
a
man,
she
said,
that
was
both
gentle
and
brave,
strong
and
merciful
a
man
that
might
not
profess
to
be
pious,
but
she
knew
he
had
the
secret
of
religion
pure
and
undefiled
before
God.
The
spirit
of
love
and
peace
was
with
him.
He
visited
the
fatherless
and
widows
in
their
affliction,
and
kept
himself
unspotted
from
the
world.
Then
she
asked,
'Do
you
approve
what
I
have
done,
Harry?'
I
could
not
answer.
My
tears
choked
me,
as
they
do
now."
Mr.
Moore
allowed
his
pupil
a
moment
to
contend
with
and
master
his
emotion.
He
then
demanded,
"What
else
did
she
say?"
"When
I
had
signified
my
full
consent
to
the
conditions
of
her
will,
she
told
me
I
was
a
generous
boy,
and
she
was
proud
of
me.
'And
now,'
she
added,
'in
case
anything
should
happen,
you
will
know
what
to
say
to
Malice
when
she
comes
whispering
hard
things
in
your
ear,
insinuating
that
Shirley
has
wronged
you,
that
she
did
not
love
you.
You
will
know
that
I
did
love
you,
Harry;
that
no
sister
could
have
loved
you
better
my
own
treasure.'
Mr.
Moore,
sir,
when
I
remember
her
voice,
and
recall
her
look,
my
heart
beats
as
if
it
would
break
its
strings.
She
may
go
to
heaven
before
me
if
God
commands
it,
she
must;
but
the
rest
of
my
life
and
my
life
will
not
be
long,
I
am
glad
of
that
now
shall
be
a
straight,
quick,
thoughtful
journey
in
the
path
her
step
has
pressed.
I
thought
to
enter
the
vault
of
the
Keeldars
before
her.
Should
it
be
otherwise,
lay
my
coffin
by
Shirley's
side."
Moore
answered
him
with
a
weighty
calm,
that
offered
a
strange
contrast
to
the
boy's
perturbed
enthusiasm.
"You
are
wrong,
both
of
you
you
harm
each
other.
If
youth
once
falls
under
the
influence
of
a
shadowy
terror,
it
imagines
there
will
never
be
full
sunlight
again;
its
first
calamity
it
fancies
will
last
a
lifetime.
What
more
did
she
say?
Anything
more?"
"We
settled
one
or
two
family
points
between
ourselves."
"I
should
rather
like
to
know
what
"
"But,
Mr.
Moore,
you
smile.
I
could
not
smile
to
see
Shirley
in
such
a
mood."
"My
boy,
I
am
neither
nervous,
nor
poetic,
nor
inexperienced.
I
see
things
as
they
are;
you
don't
as
yet.
Tell
me
these
family
points."
"Only,
sir,
she
asked
me
whether
I
considered
myself
most
of
a
Keeldar
or
a
Sympson;
and
I
answered
I
was
Keeldar
to
the
core
of
the
heart
and
to
the
marrow
of
the
bones.
She
said
she
was
glad
of
it;
for,
besides
her,
I
was
the
only
Keeldar
left
in
England.
And
then
we
agreed
on
some
matters."
"Well?"
"Well,
sir,
that
if
I
lived
to
inherit
my
father's
estate,
and
her
house,
I
was
to
take
the
name
of
Keeldar,
and
to
make
Fieldhead
my
residence.
Henry
Shirley
Keeldar
I
said
I
would
be
called;
and
I
will.
Her
name
and
her
manor
house
are
ages
old,
and
Sympson
and
Sympson
Grove
are
of
yesterday."
"Come,
you
are
neither
of
you
going
to
heaven
yet.
I
have
the
best
hopes
of
you
both,
with
your
proud
distinctions
a
pair
of
half
fledged
eaglets.
Now,
what
is
your
inference
from
all
you
have
told
me?
Put
it
into
words."
"That
Shirley
thinks
she
is
going
to
die."
"She
referred
to
her
health?"
"Not
once;
but
I
assure
you
she
is
wasting.
Her
hands
are
grown
quite
thin,
and
so
is
her
cheek."
"Does
she
