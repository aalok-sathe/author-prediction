begin
selling
stuff."
"Could
you,
William?"
"Please
God,"
returned
William
deliberately,
"I
could
buy
groceries,
and
bits
o'
tapes,
and
thread,
and
what
I
thought
would
sell,
and
I
could
begin
hawking
at
first."
"And
you
know,
sir,"
interposed
Grace,
"you're
sure
William
would
neither
drink,
nor
idle,
nor
waste,
in
any
way.
He's
my
husband,
and
I
shouldn't
praise
him;
but
I
will
say
there's
not
a
soberer,
honester
man
i'
England
nor
he
is."
"Well,
I'll
speak
to
one
or
two
friends,
and
I
think
I
can
promise
to
let
him
have
5
in
a
day
or
two
as
a
loan,
ye
mind,
not
a
gift.
He
must
pay
it
back."
"I
understand,
sir.
I'm
quite
agreeable
to
that."
"Meantime,
there's
a
few
shillings
for
you,
Grace,
just
to
keep
the
pot
boiling
till
custom
comes.
Now,
bairns,
stand
up
in
a
row
and
say
your
catechism,
while
your
mother
goes
and
buys
some
dinner;
for
you've
not
had
much
to
day,
I'll
be
bound.
You
begin,
Ben.
What
is
your
name?"
Mr.
Hall
stayed
till
Grace
came
back;
then
he
hastily
took
his
leave,
shaking
hands
with
both
Farren
and
his
wife.
Just
at
the
door
he
said
to
them
a
few
brief
but
very
earnest
words
of
religious
consolation
and
exhortation.
With
a
mutual
"God
bless
you,
sir!"
"God
bless
you,
my
friends!"
they
separated.
Messrs.
Helstone
and
Sykes
began
to
be
extremely
jocose
and
congratulatory
with
Mr.
Moore
when
he
returned
to
them
after
dismissing
the
deputation.
He
was
so
quiet,
however,
under
their
compliments
upon
his
firmness,
etc.,
and
wore
a
countenance
so
like
a
still,
dark
day,
equally
beamless
and
breezeless,
that
the
rector,
after
glancing
shrewdly
into
his
eyes,
buttoned
up
his
felicitations
with
his
coat,
and
said
to
Sykes,
whose
senses
were
not
acute
enough
to
enable
him
to
discover
unassisted
where
his
presence
and
conversation
were
a
nuisance,
"Come,
sir;
your
road
and
mine
lie
partly
together.
Had
we
not
better
bear
each
other
company?
We'll
bid
Moore
good
morning,
and
leave
him
to
the
happy
fancies
he
seems
disposed
to
indulge."
"And
where
is
Sugden?"
demanded
Moore,
looking
up.
"Ah,
ha!"
cried
Helstone.
"I've
not
been
quite
idle
while
you
were
busy.
I've
been
helping
you
a
little;
I
flatter
myself
not
injudiciously.
I
thought
it
better
not
to
lose
time;
so,
while
you
were
parleying
with
that
down
looking
gentleman
Farren
I
think
his
name
is
I
opened
this
back
window,
shouted
to
Murgatroyd,
who
was
in
the
stable,
to
bring
Mr.
Sykes's
gig
round;
then
I
smuggled
Sugden
and
brother
Moses
wooden
leg
and
all
through
the
aperture,
and
saw
them
mount
the
gig
(always
with
our
good
friend
Sykes's
permission,
of
course).
Sugden
took
the
reins
he
drives
like
Jehu
and
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
Barraclough
will
be
safe
in
Stilbro'
jail."
"Very
good;
thank
you,"
said
Moore;
"and
good
morning,
gentlemen,"
he
added,
and
so
politely
conducted
them
to
the
door,
and
saw
them
clear
of
his
premises.
He
was
a
taciturn,
serious
man
the
rest
of
the
day.
He
did
not
even
bandy
a
repartee
with
Joe
Scott,
who,
for
his
part,
said
to
his
master
only
just
what
was
absolutely
necessary
to
the
progress
of
business,
but
looked
at
him
a
good
deal
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes,
frequently
came
to
poke
the
counting
house
fire
for
him,
and
once,
as
he
was
locking
up
for
the
day
(the
mill
was
then
working
short
time,
owing
to
the
slackness
of
trade),
observed
that
it
was
a
grand
evening,
and
he
"could
wish
Mr.
Moore
to
take
a
bit
of
a
walk
up
th'
Hollow.
It
would
do
him
good."
At
this
recommendation
Mr.
Moore
burst
into
a
short
laugh,
and
after
demanding
of
Joe
what
all
this
solicitude
meant,
and
whether
he
took
him
for
a
woman
or
a
child,
seized
the
keys
from
his
hand,
and
shoved
him
by
the
shoulders
out
of
his
presence.
He
called
him
back,
however,
ere
he
had
reached
the
yard
gate.
"Joe,
do
you
know
those
Farrens?
They
are
not
well
off,
I
suppose?"
"They
cannot
be
well
off,
sir,
when
they've
not
had
work
as
a
three
month.
Ye'd
see
yoursel'
'at
William's
sorely
changed
fair
paired.
They've
selled
most
o'
t'
stuff
out
o'
th'
house."
"He
was
not
a
bad
workman?"
"Ye
never
had
a
better,
sir,
sin'
ye
began
trade."
"And
decent
people
the
whole
family?"
"Niver
dacenter.
Th'
wife's
a
raight
cant
body,
and
as
clean
ye
mught
eat
your
porridge
off
th'
house
floor.
They're
sorely
comed
down.
I
wish
William
could
get
a
job
as
gardener
or
summat
i'
that
way;
he
understands
gardening
weel.
He
once
lived
wi'
a
Scotchman
that
tached
him
the
mysteries
o'
that
craft,
as
they
say."
"Now,
then,
you
can
go,
Joe.
You
need
not
stand
there
staring
at
me."
"Ye've
no
orders
to
give,
sir?"
"None,
but
for
you
to
take
yourself
off."
Which
Joe
did
accordingly.
Spring
evenings
are
often
cold
and
raw,
and
though
this
had
been
a
fine
day,
warm
even
in
the
morning
and
meridian
sunshine,
the
air
chilled
at
sunset,
the
ground
crisped,
and
ere
dusk
a
hoar
frost
was
insidiously
stealing
over
growing
grass
and
unfolding
bud.
It
whitened
the
pavement
in
front
of
Briarmains
(Mr.
Yorke's
residence),
and
made
silent
havoc
among
the
tender
plants
in
his
garden,
and
on
the
mossy
level
of
his
lawn.
As
to
that
great
tree,
strong
trunked
and
broad
armed,
which
guarded
the
gable
nearest
the
road,
it
seemed
to
defy
a
spring
night
frost
to
harm
its
still
bare
boughs;
and
so
did
the
leafless
grove
of
walnut
trees
rising
tall
behind
the
house.
In
the
dusk
of
the
moonless
if
starry
night,
lights
from
windows
shone
vividly.
This
was
no
dark
or
lonely
scene,
nor
even
a
silent
one.
Briarmains
stood
near
the
highway.
It
was
rather
an
old
place,
and
had
been
