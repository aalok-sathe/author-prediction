virus
mingled
with
your
blood;
and
if
it
did,
let
me
assure
you
that,
young,
healthy,
faultlessly
sound
as
you
are,
no
harm
will
ensue.
For
the
rest,
I
shall
inquire
whether
the
dog
was
really
mad.
I
hold
she
was
not
mad."
"Tell
nobody
that
she
bit
me."
"Why
should
I,
when
I
believe
the
bite
innocuous
as
a
cut
of
this
penknife?
Make
yourself
easy.
I
am
easy,
though
I
value
your
life
as
much
as
I
do
my
own
chance
of
happiness
in
eternity.
Look
up."
"Why,
Mr.
Moore?"
"I
wish
to
see
if
you
are
cheered.
Put
your
work
down;
raise
your
head."
"There
"
"Look
at
me.
Thank
you.
And
is
the
cloud
broken?"
"I
fear
nothing."
"Is
your
mind
restored
to
its
own
natural
sunny
clime?"
"I
am
very
content;
but
I
want
your
promise."
"Dictate."
"You
know,
in
case
the
worst
I
have
feared
should
happen,
they
will
smother
me.
You
need
not
smile.
They
will;
they
always
do.
My
uncle
will
be
full
of
horror,
weakness,
precipitation;
and
that
is
the
only
expedient
which
will
suggest
itself
to
him.
Nobody
in
the
house
will
be
self
possessed
but
you.
Now
promise
to
befriend
me
to
keep
Mr.
Sympson
away
from
me,
not
to
let
Henry
come
near,
lest
I
should
hurt
him.
Mind
mind
that
you
take
care
of
yourself
too.
But
I
shall
not
injure
you;
I
know
I
shall
not.
Lock
the
chamber
door
against
the
surgeons;
turn
them
out
if
they
get
in.
Let
neither
the
young
nor
the
old
MacTurk
lay
a
finger
on
me;
nor
Mr.
Greaves,
their
colleague;
and
lastly,
if
I
give
trouble,
with
your
own
hand
administer
to
me
a
strong
narcotic
such
a
sure
dose
of
laudanum
as
shall
leave
no
mistake.
Promise
to
do
this."
Moore
left
his
desk,
and
permitted
himself
the
recreation
of
one
or
two
turns
through
the
room.
Stopping
behind
Shirley's
chair,
he
bent
over
her,
and
said,
in
a
low,
emphatic
voice,
"I
promise
all
you
ask
without
comment,
without
reservation."
"If
female
help
is
needed,
call
in
my
housekeeper,
Mrs.
Gill.
Let
her
lay
me
out
if
I
die.
She
is
attached
to
me.
She
wronged
me
again
and
again,
and
again
and
again
I
forgave
her.
She
now
loves
me,
and
would
not
defraud
me
of
a
pin.
Confidence
has
made
her
honest;
forbearance
has
made
her
kind
hearted.
At
this
day
I
can
trust
both
her
integrity,
her
courage,
and
her
affection.
Call
her;
but
keep
my
good
aunt
and
my
timid
cousins
away.
Once
more,
promise."
"I
promise."
"That
is
good
in
you,"
she
said,
looking
up
at
him
as
he
bent
over
her,
and
smiling.
"Is
it
good?
Does
it
comfort?"
"Very
much."
"I
will
be
with
you
I
and
Mrs.
Gill
only
in
any,
in
every
extremity
where
calm
and
fidelity
are
needed.
No
rash
or
coward
hand
shall
meddle."
"Yet
you
think
me
childish?"
"I
do."
"Ah!
you
despise
me."
"Do
we
despise
children?"
"In
fact,
I
am
neither
so
strong,
nor
have
I
such
pride
in
my
strength,
as
people
think,
Mr.
Moore;
nor
am
I
so
regardless
of
sympathy.
But
when
I
have
any
grief,
I
fear
to
impart
it
to
those
I
love,
lest
it
should
pain
them;
and
to
those
whom
I
view
with
indifference
I
cannot
condescend
to
complain.
After
all,
you
should
not
taunt
me
with
being
childish,
for
if
you
were
as
unhappy
as
I
have
been
for
the
last
three
weeks,
you
too
would
want
some
friend."
"We
all
want
a
friend,
do
we
not?"
"All
of
us
that
have
anything
good
in
our
natures."
"Well,
you
have
Caroline
Helstone."
"Yes.
And
you
have
Mr.
Hall."
"Yes.
Mrs.
Pryor
is
a
wise,
good
woman.
She
can
counsel
you
when
you
need
counsel."
"For
your
part,
you
have
your
brother
Robert."
"For
any
right
hand
defections,
there
is
the
Rev.
Matthewson
Helstone,
M.A.,
to
lean
upon;
for
any
left
hand
fallings
off
there
is
Hiram
Yorke,
Esq.
Both
elders
pay
you
homage."
"I
never
saw
Mrs.
Yorke
so
motherly
to
any
young
man
as
she
is
to
you.
I
don't
know
how
you
have
won
her
heart,
but
she
is
more
tender
to
you
than
she
is
to
her
own
sons.
You
have,
besides,
your
sister
Hortense."
"It
appears
we
are
both
well
provided."
"It
appears
so."
"How
thankful
we
ought
to
be!"
"Yes."
"How
contented!"
"Yes."
"For
my
part,
I
am
almost
contented
just
now,
and
very
thankful.
Gratitude
is
a
divine
emotion.
It
fills
the
heart,
but
not
to
bursting;
it
warms
it,
but
not
to
fever.
I
like
to
taste
leisurely
of
bliss.
Devoured
in
haste,
I
do
not
know
its
flavour."
Still
leaning
on
the
back
of
Miss
Keeldar's
chair,
Moore
watched
the
rapid
motion
of
her
fingers,
as
the
green
and
purple
garland
grew
beneath
them.
After
a
prolonged
pause,
he
again
asked,
"Is
the
shadow
quite
gone?"
"Wholly.
As
I
was
two
hours
since,
and
as
I
am
now,
are
two
different
states
of
existence.
I
believe,
Mr.
Moore,
griefs
and
fears
nursed
in
silence
grow
like
Titan
infants."
"You
will
cherish
such
feelings
no
more
in
silence?"
"Not
if
I
dare
speak."
"In
using
the
word
'dare,'
to
whom
do
you
allude?"
"To
you."
"How
is
it
applicable
to
me?"
"On
account
of
your
austerity
and
shyness."
"Why
am
I
austere
and
shy?"
"Because
you
are
proud."
"Why
am
I
proud?"
"I
should
like
to
know.
Will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me?"
"Perhaps,
because
I
am
poor,
for
one
reason.
Poverty
and
pride
often
go
together."
"That
is
such
a
nice
reason.
I
should
be
charmed
to
discover
another
that
would
pair
with
it.
Mate
that
turtle,
Mr.
Moore."
"Immediately.
What
do
you
think
of
marrying
to
sober
Poverty
many
tinted
Caprice?"
"Are
you
capricious?"
"You
are."
"A
libel.
I
am
steady
as
a
rock,
fixed
as
the
polar
star."
"I
look
out
at
