tying
it
over
her
black
apron,
rushed
eperdue
into
the
kitchen,
whence,
to
speak
truth,
exhaled
an
odour
of
calcined
sweets
rather
strong
than
savoury.
The
mistress
and
maid
had
been
in
full
feud
the
whole
day,
on
the
subject
of
preserving
certain
black
cherries,
hard
as
marbles,
sour
as
sloes.
Sarah
held
that
sugar
was
the
only
orthodox
condiment
to
be
used
in
that
process;
mademoiselle
maintained
and
proved
it
by
the
practice
and
experience
of
her
mother,
grandmother,
and
great
grandmother
that
treacle,
"melasse,"
was
infinitely
preferable.
She
had
committed
an
imprudence
in
leaving
Sarah
in
charge
of
the
preserving
pan,
for
her
want
of
sympathy
in
the
nature
of
its
contents
had
induced
a
degree
of
carelessness
in
watching
their
confection,
whereof
the
result
was
dark
and
cindery
ruin.
Hubbub
followed;
high
upbraiding,
and
sobs
rather
loud
than
deep
or
real.
Caroline,
once
more
turning
to
the
little
mirror,
was
shading
her
ringlets
from
her
cheek
to
smooth
them
under
her
cottage
bonnet,
certain
that
it
would
not
only
be
useless
but
unpleasant
to
stay
longer,
when,
on
the
sudden
opening
of
the
back
door,
there
fell
an
abrupt
calm
in
the
kitchen.
The
tongues
were
checked,
pulled
up
as
with
bit
and
bridle.
"Was
it
was
it
Robert?"
He
often
almost
always
entered
by
the
kitchen
way
on
his
return
from
market.
No;
it
was
only
Joe
Scott,
who,
having
hemmed
significantly
thrice
every
hem
being
meant
as
a
lofty
rebuke
to
the
squabbling
womankind
said,
"Now,
I
thowt
I
heerd
a
crack?"
None
answered.
"And,"
he
continued
pragmatically,
"as
t'
maister's
comed,
and
as
he'll
enter
through
this
hoyle,
I
considered
it
desirable
to
step
in
and
let
ye
know.
A
household
o'
women
is
nivver
fit
to
be
comed
on
wi'out
warning.
Here
he
is.
Walk
forrard,
sir.
They
war
playing
up
queerly,
but
I
think
I've
quietened
'em."
Another
person,
it
was
now
audible,
entered.
Joe
Scott
proceeded
with
his
rebukes.
"What
d'ye
mean
by
being
all
i'
darkness?
Sarah,
thou
quean,
canst
t'
not
light
a
candle?
It
war
sundown
an
hour
syne.
He'll
brak
his
shins
agean
some
o'
yer
pots,
and
tables,
and
stuff.
Tak
tent
o'
this
baking
bowl,
sir;
they've
set
it
i'
yer
way,
fair
as
if
they
did
it
i'
malice."
To
Joe's
observations
succeeded
a
confused
sort
of
pause,
which
Caroline,
though
she
was
listening
with
both
her
ears,
could
not
understand.
It
was
very
brief.
A
cry
broke
it
a
sound
of
surprise,
followed
by
the
sound
of
a
kiss;
ejaculations,
but
half
articulate,
succeeded.
"Mon
Dieu!
mon
Dieu!
Est
ce
que
je
m'y
attendais?"
were
the
words
chiefly
to
be
distinguished.
"Et
tu
te
portes
toujours
bien,
bonne
seaur?"
inquired
another
voice
Robert's,
certainly.
Caroline
was
puzzled.
Obeying
an
impulse
the
wisdom
of
which
she
had
not
time
to
question,
she
escaped
from
the
little
parlour,
by
way
of
leaving
the
coast
clear,
and
running
upstairs
took
up
a
position
at
the
head
of
the
banisters,
whence
she
could
make
further
observations
ere
presenting
herself.
It
was
considerably
past
sunset
now;
dusk
filled
the
passage,
yet
not
such
deep
dusk
but
that
she
could
presently
see
Robert
and
Hortense
traverse
it.
"Caroline!
Caroline!"
called
Hortense,
a
moment
afterwards,
"venez
voir
mon
frere!"
"Strange,"
commented
Miss
Helstone,
"passing
strange!
What
does
this
unwonted
excitement
about
such
an
every
day
occurrence
as
a
return
from
market
portend?
She
has
not
lost
her
senses,
has
she?
Surely
the
burnt
treacle
has
not
crazed
her?"
She
descended
in
a
subdued
flutter.
Yet
more
was
she
fluttered
when
Hortense
seized
her
hand
at
the
parlour
door,
and
leading
her
to
Robert,
who
stood
in
bodily
presence,
tall
and
dark
against
the
one
window,
presented
her
with
a
mixture
of
agitation
and
formality,
as
though
they
had
been
utter
strangers,
and
this
was
their
first
mutual
introduction.
Increasing
puzzle!
He
bowed
rather
awkwardly,
and
turning
from
her
with
a
stranger's
embarrassment,
he
met
the
doubtful
light
from
the
window.
It
fell
on
his
face,
and
the
enigma
of
the
dream
(a
dream
it
seemed)
was
at
its
height.
She
saw
a
visage
like
and
unlike
Robert,
and
no
Robert.
"What
is
the
matter?"
said
Caroline.
"Is
my
sight
wrong?
Is
it
my
cousin?"
"Certainly
it
is
your
cousin,"
asserted
Hortense.
Then
who
was
this
now
coming
through
the
passage
now
entering
the
room?
Caroline,
looking
round,
met
a
new
Robert
the
real
Robert,
as
she
felt
at
once.
"Well,"
said
he,
smiling
at
her
questioning,
astonished
face,
"which
is
which?"
"Ah,
this
is
you!"
was
the
answer.
He
laughed.
"I
believe
it
is
me.
And
do
you
know
who
he
is?
You
never
saw
him
before,
but
you
have
heard
of
him."
She
had
gathered
her
senses
now.
"It
can
be
only
one
person
your
brother,
since
it
is
so
like
you;
my
other
cousin,
Louis."
"Clever
little
eadipus!
you
would
have
baffled
the
Sphinx!
But
now,
see
us
together.
Change
places;
change
again,
to
confuse
her,
Louis.
Which
is
the
old
love
now,
Lina?"
"As
if
it
were
possible
to
make
a
mistake
when
you
speak!
You
should
have
told
Hortense
to
ask.
But
you
are
not
so
much
alike.
It
is
only
your
height,
your
figure,
and
complexion
that
are
so
similar."
"And
I
am
Robert,
am
I
not?"
asked
the
newcomer,
making
a
first
effort
to
overcome
what
seemed
his
natural
shyness.
Caroline
shook
her
head
gently.
A
soft,
expressive
ray
from
her
eye
beamed
on
the
real
Robert.
It
said
much.
She
was
not
permitted
to
quit
her
cousins
soon.
Robert
himself
was
peremptory
in
obliging
her
to
remain.
Glad,
simple,
and
affable
in
her
demeanour
(glad
for
this
night,
at
least),
in
light,
bright
spirits
for
the
time,
she
was
too
pleasant
an
addition
to
the
cottage
circle
to
be
willingly
parted
with
by
any
of
them.
Louis
seemed
naturally
rather
a
grave,
still,
retiring
man;
but
the
Caroline
of
this
evening,
which
was
