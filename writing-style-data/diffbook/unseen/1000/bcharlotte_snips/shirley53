her
husband;
she
has
not
yet
found
out
that
he
is
hampered
by
a
secret
intrigue
which
prevents
him
from
marrying,
or
that
he
is
a
wolf
in
sheep's
clothing
discoveries
which
she
made
at
an
early
date
after
marriage
concerning
most
of
her
husband's
bachelor
friends,
and
excluded
them
from
her
board
accordingly;
which
part
of
her
conduct,
indeed,
might
be
said
to
have
its
just
and
sensible
as
well
as
its
harsh
side.
"Well,
is
it
you?"
she
says
to
Mr.
Moore,
as
he
comes
up
to
her
and
gives
his
hand.
"What
are
you
roving
about
at
this
time
of
night
for?
You
should
be
at
home."
"Can
a
single
man
be
said
to
have
a
home,
madam?"
he
asks.
"Pooh!"
says
Mrs.
Yorke,
who
despises
conventional
smoothness
quite
as
much
as
her
husband
does,
and
practises
it
as
little,
and
whose
plain
speaking
on
all
occasions
is
carried
to
a
point
calculated,
sometimes,
to
awaken
admiration,
but
oftener
alarm
"pooh!
you
need
not
talk
nonsense
to
me;
a
single
man
can
have
a
home
if
he
likes.
Pray,
does
not
your
sister
make
a
home
for
you?"
"Not
she,"
joined
in
Mr.
Yorke.
"Hortense
is
an
honest
lass.
But
when
I
was
Robert's
age
I
had
five
or
six
sisters,
all
as
decent
and
proper
as
she
is;
but
you
see,
Hesther,
for
all
that
it
did
not
hinder
me
from
looking
out
for
a
wife."
"And
sorely
he
has
repented
marrying
me,"
added
Mrs.
Yorke,
who
liked
occasionally
to
crack
a
dry
jest
against
matrimony,
even
though
it
should
be
at
her
own
expense.
"He
has
repented
it
in
sackcloth
and
ashes,
Robert
Moore,
as
you
may
well
believe
when
you
see
his
punishment"
(here
she
pointed
to
her
children).
"Who
would
burden
themselves
with
such
a
set
of
great,
rough
lads
as
those,
if
they
could
help
it?
It
is
not
only
bringing
them
into
the
world,
though
that
is
bad
enough,
but
they
are
all
to
feed,
to
clothe,
to
rear,
to
settle
in
life.
Young
sir,
when
you
feel
tempted
to
marry,
think
of
our
four
sons
and
two
daughters,
and
look
twice
before
you
leap."
"I
am
not
tempted
now,
at
any
rate.
I
think
these
are
not
times
for
marrying
or
giving
in
marriage."
A
lugubrious
sentiment
of
this
sort
was
sure
to
obtain
Mrs.
Yorke's
approbation.
She
nodded
and
groaned
acquiescence;
but
in
a
minute
she
said,
"I
make
little
account
of
the
wisdom
of
a
Solomon
of
your
age;
it
will
be
upset
by
the
first
fancy
that
crosses
you.
Meantime,
sit
down,
sir.
You
can
talk,
I
suppose,
as
well
sitting
as
standing?"
This
was
her
way
of
inviting
her
guest
to
take
a
chair.
He
had
no
sooner
obeyed
her
than
little
Jessy
jumped
from
her
father's
knee
and
ran
into
Mr.
Moore's
arms,
which
were
very
promptly
held
out
to
receive
her.
"You
talk
of
marrying
him,"
said
she
to
her
mother,
quite
indignantly,
as
she
was
lifted
lightly
to
his
knee,
"and
he
is
married
now,
or
as
good.
He
promised
that
I
should
be
his
wife
last
summer,
the
first
time
he
saw
me
in
my
new
white
frock
and
blue
sash.
Didn't
he,
father?"
(These
children
were
not
accustomed
to
say
papa
and
mamma;
their
mother
would
allow
no
such
"namby
pamby.")
"Ay,
my
little
lassie,
he
promised;
I'll
bear
witness.
But
make
him
say
it
over
again
now,
Jessy.
Such
as
he
are
only
false
loons."
"He
is
not
false.
He
is
too
bonny
to
be
false,"
said
Jessy,
looking
up
to
her
tall
sweetheart
with
the
fullest
confidence
in
his
faith.
"Bonny!"
cried
Mr.
Yorke.
"That's
the
reason
that
he
should
be,
and
proof
that
he
is,
a
scoundrel."
"But
he
looks
too
sorrowful
to
be
false,"
here
interposed
a
quiet
voice
from
behind
the
father's
chair.
"If
he
was
always
laughing,
I
should
think
he
forgot
promises
soon,
but
Mr.
Moore
never
laughs."
"Your
sentimental
buck
is
the
greatest
cheat
of
all,
Rose,"
remarked
Mr.
Yorke.
"He's
not
sentimental,"
said
Rose.
Mr.
Moore
turned
to
her
with
a
little
surprise,
smiling
at
the
same
time.
"How
do
you
know
I
am
not
sentimental,
Rose?"
"Because
I
heard
a
lady
say
you
were
not."
"Voila,
qui
devient
interessant!"
exclaimed
Mr.
Yorke,
hitching
his
chair
nearer
the
fire.
"A
lady!
That
has
quite
a
romantic
twang.
We
must
guess
who
it
is.
Rosy,
whisper
the
name
low
to
your
father.
Don't
let
him
hear."
"Rose,
don't
be
too
forward
to
talk,"
here
interrupted
Mrs.
Yorke,
in
her
usual
kill
joy
fashion,
"nor
Jessy
either.
It
becomes
all
children,
especially
girls,
to
be
silent
in
the
presence
of
their
elders."
"Why
have
we
tongues,
then?"
asked
Jessy
pertly;
while
Rose
only
looked
at
her
mother
with
an
expression
that
seemed
to
say
she
should
take
that
maxim
in
and
think
it
over
at
her
leisure.
After
two
minutes'
grave
deliberation,
she
asked,
"And
why
especially
girls,
mother?"
"Firstly,
because
I
say
so;
and
secondly,
because
discretion
and
reserve
are
a
girl's
best
wisdom."
"My
dear
madam,"
observed
Moore,
"what
you
say
is
excellent
it
reminds
me,
indeed,
of
my
dear
sister's
observations;
but
really
it
is
not
applicable
to
these
little
ones.
Let
Rose
and
Jessy
talk
to
me
freely,
or
my
chief
pleasure
in
coming
here
is
gone.
I
like
their
prattle;
it
does
me
good."
"Does
it
not?"
asked
Jessy.
"More
good
than
if
the
rough
lads
came
round
you.
You
call
them
rough,
mother,
yourself."
"Yes,
mignonne,
a
thousand
times
more
good.
I
have
rough
lads
enough
about
me
all
day
long,
poulet."
"There
are
plenty
of
people,"
continued
she,
"who
take
notice
of
the
boys.
All
my
uncles
and
aunts
seem
to
think
their
nephews
better
than
their
nieces,
and
when
gentlemen
come
here
to
dine,
it
is
always
Matthew,
and
Mark,
and
Martin
that
are
talked
to,
and
never
Rose
and
me.
Mr.
Moore
is
our
friend,
