Mine
it
shall
not
be
to
accept
a
savage
girl
as
a
slave
she
could
not
be
a
wife.
I
know
no
white
woman
whom
I
love
that
would
accompany
me;
but
I
am
certain
Liberty
will
await
me,
sitting
under
a
pine.
When
I
call
her
she
will
come
to
my
loghouse,
and
she
shall
fill
my
arms.'
"She
could
not
hear
me
speak
so
unmoved,
and
she
was
moved.
It
was
right
I
meant
to
move
her.
She
could
not
answer
me,
nor
could
she
look
at
me.
I
should
have
been
sorry
if
she
could
have
done
either.
Her
cheek
glowed
as
if
a
crimson
flower
through
whose
petals
the
sun
shone
had
cast
its
light
upon
it.
On
the
white
lid
and
dark
lashes
of
her
downcast
eye
trembled
all
that
is
graceful
in
the
sense
of
half
painful,
half
pleasing
shame.
"Soon
she
controlled
her
emotion,
and
took
all
her
feelings
under
command.
I
saw
she
had
felt
insurrection,
and
was
waking
to
empire.
She
sat
down.
There
was
that
in
her
face
which
I
could
read.
It
said,
I
see
the
line
which
is
my
limit;
nothing
shall
make
me
pass
it.
I
feel
I
know
how
far
I
may
reveal
my
feelings,
and
when
I
must
clasp
the
volume.
I
have
advanced
to
a
certain
distance,
as
far
as
the
true
and
sovereign
and
undegraded
nature
of
my
kind
permits;
now
here
I
stand
rooted.
My
heart
may
break
if
it
is
baffled;
let
it
break.
It
shall
never
dishonour
me;
it
shall
never
dishonour
my
sisterhood
in
me.
Suffering
before
degradation!
death
before
treachery!
"I,
for
my
part,
said,
'If
she
were
poor,
I
would
be
at
her
feet;
if
she
were
lowly,
I
would
take
her
in
my
arms.
Her
gold
and
her
station
are
two
griffins
that
guard
her
on
each
side.
Love
looks
and
longs,
and
dares
not;
Passion
hovers
round,
and
is
kept
at
bay;
Truth
and
Devotion
are
scared.
There
is
nothing
to
lose
in
winning
her,
no
sacrifice
to
make.
It
is
all
clear
gain,
and
therefore
unimaginably
difficult.'
"Difficult
or
not,
something
must
be
done,
something
must
be
said.
I
could
not,
and
would
not,
sit
silent
with
all
that
beauty
modestly
mute
in
my
presence.
I
spoke
thus,
and
still
I
spoke
with
calm.
Quiet
as
my
words
were,
I
could
hear
they
fell
in
a
tone
distinct,
round,
and
deep.
"'Still,
I
know
I
shall
be
strangely
placed
with
that
mountain
nymph
Liberty.
She
is,
I
suspect,
akin
to
that
Solitude
which
I
once
wooed,
and
from
which
I
now
seek
a
divorce.
These
Oreads
are
peculiar.
They
come
upon
you
with
an
unearthly
charm,
like
some
starlight
evening;
they
inspire
a
wild
but
not
warm
delight;
their
beauty
is
the
beauty
of
spirits;
their
grace
is
not
the
grace
of
life,
but
of
seasons
or
scenes
in
nature.
Theirs
is
the
dewy
bloom
of
morning,
the
languid
flush
of
evening,
the
peace
of
the
moon,
the
changefulness
of
clouds.
I
want
and
will
have
something
different.
This
elfish
splendour
looks
chill
to
my
vision,
and
feels
frozen
to
my
touch.
I
am
not
a
poet;
I
cannot
live
with
abstractions.
You,
Miss
Keeldar,
have
sometimes,
in
your
laughing
satire,
called
me
a
material
philosopher,
and
implied
that
I
live
sufficiently
for
the
substantial.
Certainly
I
feel
material
from
head
to
foot;
and
glorious
as
Nature
is,
and
deeply
as
I
worship
her
with
the
solid
powers
of
a
solid
heart,
I
would
rather
behold
her
through
the
soft
human
eyes
of
a
loved
and
lovely
wife
than
through
the
wild
orbs
of
the
highest
goddess
of
Olympus.'
"'Juno
could
not
cook
a
buffalo
steak
as
you
like
it,'
said
she.
"'She
could
not;
but
I
will
tell
you
who
could
some
young,
penniless,
friendless
orphan
girl.
I
wish
I
could
find
such
a
one
pretty
enough
for
me
to
love,
with
something
of
the
mind
and
heart
suited
to
my
taste;
not
uneducated
honest
and
modest.
I
care
nothing
for
attainments,
but
I
would
fain
have
the
germ
of
those
sweet
natural
powers
which
nothing
acquired
can
rival;
any
temper
Fate
wills
I
can
manage
the
hottest.
To
such
a
creature
as
this
I
should
like
to
be
first
tutor
and
then
husband.
I
would
teach
her
my
language,
my
habits
and
my
principles,
and
then
I
would
reward
her
with
my
love.'
"'Reward
her,
lord
of
the
creation
reward
her!'"
ejaculated
she,
with
a
curled
lip.
"'And
be
repaid
a
thousandfold.'
"'If
she
willed
it,
monseigneur.'
"'And
she
should
will
it.'
"'You
have
stipulated
for
any
temper
Fate
wills.
Compulsion
is
flint
and
a
blow
to
the
metal
of
some
souls.'
"'And
love
the
spark
it
elicits.'
"'Who
cares
for
the
love
that
is
but
a
spark
seen,
flown
upward,
and
gone?'
"'I
must
find
my
orphan
girl.
Tell
me
how,
Miss
Keeldar.'
"'Advertise;
and
be
sure
you
add,
when
you
describe
the
qualifications,
she
must
be
a
good
plain
cook.'
"'I
must
find
her;
and
when
I
do
find
her
I
shall
marry
her.'
"'Not
you!'
and
her
voice
took
a
sudden
accent
of
peculiar
scorn.
"I
liked
this.
I
had
roused
her
from
the
pensive
mood
in
which
I
had
first
found
her.
I
would
stir
her
further.
"'Why
doubt
it?'
"'You
marry!'
"'Yes,
of
course;
nothing
more
evident
than
that
I
can
and
shall.'
"'The
contrary
is
evident,
Mr.
Moore.'
"She
charmed
me
in
this
mood
waxing
disdainful,
half
insulting;
pride,
temper,
derision,
blent
in
her
large
fine
eye,
that
had
just
now
the
look
of
a
merlin's.
"'Favour
me
with
your
reasons
for
such
an
opinion,
Miss
Keeldar.'
"'How
will
you
manage
to
marry,
I
wonder?'
"'I
shall
manage
it
with
ease
and
speed
when
I
find
the
proper
person.'
"'Accept
celibacy!'
(and
she
made
a
gesture
with
her
hand
as
if
she
gave
me
something)
'take
it
as
your
doom!'
"'No;
you
cannot
give
what
I
