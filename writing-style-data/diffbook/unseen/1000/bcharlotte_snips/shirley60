morrow.
I
have
not
got
it;
he
would
not
give
it;
he
is
gone.
Strange
that
grief
should
now
almost
choke
me,
because
another
human
being's
eye
has
failed
to
greet
mine."
That
Sunday
evening,
Mr.
Malone
coming,
as
usual,
to
pass
it
with
his
rector,
Caroline
withdrew
after
tea
to
her
chamber.
Fanny,
knowing
her
habits,
had
lit
her
a
cheerful
little
fire,
as
the
weather
was
so
gusty
and
chill.
Closeted
there,
silent
and
solitary,
what
could
she
do
but
think?
She
noiselessly
paced
to
and
fro
the
carpeted
floor,
her
head
drooped,
her
hands
folded.
It
was
irksome
to
sit;
the
current
of
reflection
ran
rapidly
through
her
mind;
to
night
she
was
mutely
excited.
Mute
was
the
room,
mute
the
house.
The
double
door
of
the
study
muffled
the
voices
of
the
gentlemen.
The
servants
were
quiet
in
the
kitchen,
engaged
with
books
their
young
mistress
had
lent
them
books
which
she
had
told
them
were
"fit
for
Sunday
reading."
And
she
herself
had
another
of
the
same
sort
open
on
the
table,
but
she
could
not
read
it.
Its
theology
was
incomprehensible
to
her,
and
her
own
mind
was
too
busy,
teeming,
wandering,
to
listen
to
the
language
of
another
mind.
Then,
too,
her
imagination
was
full
of
pictures
images
of
Moore,
scenes
where
he
and
she
had
been
together;
winter
fireside
sketches;
a
glowing
landscape
of
a
hot
summer
afternoon
passed
with
him
in
the
bosom
of
Nunnely
Wood;
divine
vignettes
of
mild
spring
or
mellow
autumn
moments,
when
she
had
sat
at
his
side
in
Hollow's
Copse,
listening
to
the
call
of
the
May
cuckoo,
or
sharing
the
September
treasure
of
nuts
and
ripe
blackberries
a
wild
dessert
which
it
was
her
morning's
pleasure
to
collect
in
a
little
basket,
and
cover
with
green
leaves
and
fresh
blossoms,
and
her
afternoon's
delight
to
administer
to
Moore,
berry
by
berry,
and
nut
by
nut,
like
a
bird
feeding
its
fledgling.
Robert's
features
and
form
were
with
her;
the
sound
of
his
voice
was
quite
distinct
in
her
ear;
his
few
caresses
seemed
renewed.
But
these
joys,
being
hollow,
were,
ere
long,
crushed
in.
The
pictures
faded,
the
voice
failed,
the
visionary
clasp
melted
chill
from
her
hand,
and
where
the
warm
seal
of
lips
had
made
impress
on
her
forehead,
it
felt
now
as
if
a
sleety
rain
drop
had
fallen.
She
returned
from
an
enchanted
region
to
the
real
world:
for
Nunnely
Wood
in
June
she
saw
her
narrow
chamber;
for
the
songs
of
birds
in
alleys
she
heard
the
rain
on
her
casement;
for
the
sigh
of
the
south
wind
came
the
sob
of
the
mournful
east;
and
for
Moore's
manly
companionship
she
had
the
thin
illusion
of
her
own
dim
shadow
on
the
wall.
Turning
from
the
pale
phantom
which
reflected
herself
in
its
outline,
and
her
reverie
in
the
drooped
attitude
of
its
dim
head
and
colourless
tresses,
she
sat
down
inaction
would
suit
the
frame
of
mind
into
which
she
was
now
declining
she
said
to
herself,
"I
have
to
live,
perhaps,
till
seventy
years.
As
far
as
I
know,
I
have
good
health;
half
a
century
of
existence
may
lie
before
me.
How
am
I
to
occupy
it?
What
am
I
to
do
to
fill
the
interval
of
time
which
spreads
between
me
and
the
grave?"
She
reflected.
"I
shall
not
be
married,
it
appears,"
she
continued.
"I
suppose,
as
Robert
does
not
care
for
me,
I
shall
never
have
a
husband
to
love,
nor
little
children
to
take
care
of.
Till
lately
I
had
reckoned
securely
on
the
duties
and
affections
of
wife
and
mother
to
occupy
my
existence.
I
considered,
somehow,
as
a
matter
of
course,
that
I
was
growing
up
to
the
ordinary
destiny,
and
never
troubled
myself
to
seek
any
other;
but
now
I
perceive
plainly
I
may
have
been
mistaken.
Probably
I
shall
be
an
old
maid.
I
shall
live
to
see
Robert
married
to
some
one
else,
some
rich
lady.
I
shall
never
marry.
What
was
I
created
for,
I
wonder?
Where
is
my
place
in
the
world?"
She
mused
again.
"Ah!
I
see,"
she
pursued
presently;
"that
is
the
question
which
most
old
maids
are
puzzled
to
solve.
Other
people
solve
it
for
them
by
saying,
'Your
place
is
to
do
good
to
others,
to
be
helpful
whenever
help
is
wanted.'
That
is
right
in
some
measure,
and
a
very
convenient
doctrine
for
the
people
who
hold
it;
but
I
perceive
that
certain
sets
of
human
beings
are
very
apt
to
maintain
that
other
sets
should
give
up
their
lives
to
them
and
their
service,
and
then
they
requite
them
by
praise;
they
call
them
devoted
and
virtuous.
Is
this
enough?
Is
it
to
live?
Is
there
not
a
terrible
hollowness,
mockery,
want,
craving,
in
that
existence
which
is
given
away
to
others,
for
want
of
something
of
your
own
to
bestow
it
on?
I
suspect
there
is.
Does
virtue
lie
in
abnegation
of
self?
I
do
not
believe
it.
Undue
humility
makes
tyranny;
weak
concession
creates
selfishness.
The
Romish
religion
especially
teaches
renunciation
of
self,
submission
to
others,
and
nowhere
are
found
so
many
grasping
tyrants
as
in
the
ranks
of
the
Romish
priesthood.
Each
human
being
has
his
share
of
rights.
I
suspect
it
would
conduce
to
the
happiness
and
welfare
of
all
if
each
knew
his
allotment,
and
held
to
it
as
tenaciously
as
the
martyr
to
his
creed.
Queer
thoughts
these
that
surge
in
my
mind.
Are
they
right
thoughts?
I
am
not
certain.
"Well,
life
is
short
at
the
best.
Seventy
years,
they
say,
pass
like
a
vapour,
like
a
dream
when
one
awaketh;
and
every
path
trod
by
human
feet
terminates
in
one
bourne
the
grave,
the
little
chink
in
the
surface
of
this
great
globe,
the
furrow
where
the
mighty
husbandman
with
the
scythe
deposits
the
seed
he
has
shaken
from
the
ripe
stem;
and
there
it
falls,
decays,
and
thence
it
springs
again,
