delusion.
But
I
will
write,
and
say
you
advise
his
return."
"Do
not
say
I
advise
his
return,
but
that
his
return
is
advisable."
The
second
bell
rang,
and
Miss
Keeldar
obeyed
its
call.
Louis
Moore
was
used
to
a
quiet
life.
Being
a
quiet
man,
he
endured
it
better
than
most
men
would.
Having
a
large
world
of
his
own
in
his
own
head
and
heart,
he
tolerated
confinement
to
a
small,
still
corner
of
the
real
world
very
patiently.
How
hushed
is
Fieldhead
this
evening!
All
but
Moore
Miss
Keeldar,
the
whole
family
of
the
Sympsons,
even
Henry
are
gone
to
Nunnely.
Sir
Philip
would
have
them
come;
he
wished
to
make
them
acquainted
with
his
mother
and
sisters,
who
are
now
at
the
priory.
Kind
gentleman
as
the
baronet
is,
he
asked
the
tutor
too;
but
the
tutor
would
much
sooner
have
made
an
appointment
with
the
ghost
of
the
Earl
of
Huntingdon
to
meet
him,
and
a
shadowy
ring
of
his
merry
men,
under
the
canopy
of
the
thickest,
blackest,
oldest
oak
in
Nunnely
Forest.
Yes,
he
would
rather
have
appointed
tryst
with
a
phantom
abbess,
or
mist
pale
nun,
among
the
wet
and
weedy
relics
of
that
ruined
sanctuary
of
theirs,
mouldering
in
the
core
of
the
wood.
Louis
Moore
longs
to
have
something
near
him
to
night;
but
not
the
boy
baronet,
nor
his
benevolent
but
stern
mother,
nor
his
patrician
sisters,
nor
one
soul
of
the
Sympsons.
This
night
is
not
calm;
the
equinox
still
struggles
in
its
storms.
The
wild
rains
of
the
day
are
abated;
the
great
single
cloud
disparts
and
rolls
away
from
heaven,
not
passing
and
leaving
a
sea
all
sapphire,
but
tossed
buoyant
before
a
continued,
long
sounding,
high
rushing
moonlight
tempest.
The
moon
reigns
glorious,
glad
of
the
gale,
as
glad
as
if
she
gave
herself
to
his
fierce
caress
with
love.
No
Endymion
will
watch
for
his
goddess
to
night.
There
are
no
flocks
out
on
the
mountains;
and
it
is
well,
for
to
night
she
welcomes
eaolus.
Moore,
sitting
in
the
schoolroom,
heard
the
storm
roar
round
the
other
gable
and
along
the
hall
front.
This
end
was
sheltered.
He
wanted
no
shelter;
he
desired
no
subdued
sounds
or
screened
position.
"All
the
parlours
are
empty,"
said
he.
"I
am
sick
at
heart
of
this
cell."
He
left
it,
and
went
where
the
casements,
larger
and
freer
than
the
branch
screened
lattice
of
his
own
apartment,
admitted
unimpeded
the
dark
blue,
the
silver
fleeced,
the
stirring
and
sweeping
vision
of
the
autumn
night
sky.
He
carried
no
candle;
unneeded
was
lamp
or
fire.
The
broad
and
clear
though
cloud
crossed
and
fluctuating
beam
of
the
moon
shone
on
every
floor
and
wall.
Moore
wanders
through
all
the
rooms.
He
seems
following
a
phantom
from
parlour
to
parlour.
In
the
oak
room
he
stops.
This
is
not
chill,
and
polished,
and
fireless
like
the
salon.
The
hearth
is
hot
and
ruddy;
the
cinders
tinkle
in
the
intense
heat
of
their
clear
glow;
near
the
rug
is
a
little
work
table,
a
desk
upon
it,
a
chair
near
it.
Does
the
vision
Moore
has
tracked
occupy
that
chair?
You
would
think
so,
could
you
see
him
standing
before
it.
There
is
as
much
interest
now
in
his
eye,
and
as
much
significance
in
his
face,
as
if
in
this
household
solitude
he
had
found
a
living
companion,
and
was
going
to
speak
to
it.
He
makes
discoveries.
A
bag
a
small
satin
bag
hangs
on
the
chair
back.
The
desk
is
open,
the
keys
are
in
the
lock.
A
pretty
seal,
a
silver
pen,
a
crimson
berry
or
two
of
ripe
fruit
on
a
green
leaf,
a
small,
clean,
delicate
glove
these
trifles
at
once
decorate
and
disarrange
the
stand
they
strew.
Order
forbids
details
in
a
picture
she
puts
them
tidily
away;
but
details
give
charm.
Moore
spoke.
"Her
mark,"
he
said.
"Here
she
has
been
careless,
attractive
thing!
called
away
in
haste,
doubtless,
and
forgetting
to
return
and
put
all
to
rights.
Why
does
she
leave
fascination
in
her
footprints?
Whence
did
she
acquire
the
gift
to
be
heedless
and
never
offend?
There
is
always
something
to
chide
in
her,
and
the
reprimand
never
settles
in
displeasure
on
the
heart,
but,
for
her
lover
or
her
husband,
when
it
had
trickled
a
while
in
words,
would
naturally
melt
from
his
lips
in
a
kiss.
Better
pass
half
an
hour
in
remonstrating
with
her
than
a
day
in
admiring
or
praising
any
other
woman
alive.
Am
I
muttering?
soliloquizing?
Stop
that."
He
did
stop
it.
He
stood
thinking,
and
then
he
made
an
arrangement
for
his
evening's
comfort.
He
dropped
the
curtains
over
the
broad
window
and
regal
moon.
He
shut
out
sovereign
and
court
and
starry
armies;
he
added
fuel
to
the
hot
but
fast
wasting
fire;
he
lit
a
candle,
of
which
there
were
a
pair
on
the
table;
he
placed
another
chair
opposite
that
near
the
workstand;
and
then
he
sat
down.
His
next
movement
was
to
take
from
his
pocket
a
small,
thick
book
of
blank
paper,
to
produce
a
pencil,
and
to
begin
to
write
in
a
cramp,
compact
hand.
Come
near,
by
all
means,
reader.
Do
not
be
shy.
Stoop
over
his
shoulder
fearlessly,
and
read
as
he
scribbles.
"It
is
nine
o'clock;
the
carriage
will
not
return
before
eleven,
I
am
certain.
Freedom
is
mine
till
then;
till
then
I
may
occupy
her
room,
sit
opposite
her
chair,
rest
my
elbow
on
her
table,
have
her
little
mementoes
about
me.
"I
used
rather
to
like
Solitude
to
fancy
her
a
somewhat
quiet
and
serious,
yet
fair
nymph;
an
Oread,
descending
to
me
from
lone
mountain
passes,
something
of
the
blue
mist
of
hills
in
her
array
and
of
their
chill
breeze
in
her
breath,
but
much
also
of
their
solemn
beauty
in
her
mien.
I
once
could
court
her
serenely,
and
imagine
my
heart
easier
when
I
held
her
