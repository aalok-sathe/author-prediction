him,
however.
He
has
had
a
stormy
courtship
for
such
a
calm
character;
but
you
see
it
all
ends
in
victory
for
him.
Caroline,
I
have
sought
you
to
ask
an
audience.
Why
are
those
bells
ringing?"
"For
the
repeal
of
your
terrible
law
the
Orders
you
hate
so
much.
You
are
pleased,
are
you
not?"
"Yesterday
evening
at
this
time
I
was
packing
some
books
for
a
sea
voyage.
They
were
the
only
possessions,
except
some
clothes,
seeds,
roots,
and
tools,
which
I
felt
free
to
take
with
me
to
Canada.
I
was
going
to
leave
you."
"To
leave
me?
To
leave
me?"
Her
little
fingers
fastened
on
his
arm;
she
spoke
and
looked
affrighted.
"Not
now
not
now.
Examine
my
face
yes,
look
at
me
well.
Is
the
despair
of
parting
legible
thereon?"
She
looked
into
an
illuminated
countenance,
whose
characters
were
all
beaming,
though
the
page
itself
was
dusk.
This
face,
potent
in
the
majesty
of
its
traits,
shed
down
on
her
hope,
fondness,
delight.
"Will
the
repeal
do
you
good
much
good,
immediate
good?"
she
inquired.
"The
repeal
of
the
Orders
in
Council
saves
me.
Now
I
shall
not
turn
bankrupt;
now
I
shall
not
give
up
business;
now
I
shall
not
leave
England;
now
I
shall
be
no
longer
poor;
now
I
can
pay
my
debts;
now
all
the
cloth
I
have
in
my
warehouses
will
be
taken
off
my
hands,
and
commissions
given
me
for
much
more.
This
day
lays
for
my
fortunes
a
broad,
firm
foundation,
on
which,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
can
securely
build."
Caroline
devoured
his
words;
she
held
his
hand
in
hers;
she
drew
a
long
breath.
"You
are
saved?
Your
heavy
difficulties
are
lifted?"
"They
are
lifted.
I
breathe.
I
can
act."
"At
last!
Oh,
Providence
is
kind!
Thank
Him,
Robert."
"I
do
thank
Providence."
"And
I
also,
for
your
sake!"
She
looked
up
devoutly.
"Now
I
can
take
more
workmen,
give
better
wages,
lay
wiser
and
more
liberal
plans,
do
some
good,
be
less
selfish.
Now,
Caroline,
I
can
have
a
house
a
home
which
I
can
truly
call
mine
and
now
"
He
paused,
for
his
deep
voice
was
checked.
"And
now,"
he
resumed
"now
I
can
think
of
marriage,
now
I
can
seek
a
wife."
This
was
no
moment
for
her
to
speak.
She
did
not
speak.
"Will
Caroline,
who
meekly
hopes
to
be
forgiven
as
she
forgives
will
she
pardon
all
I
have
made
her
suffer,
all
that
long
pain
I
have
wickedly
caused
her,
all
that
sickness
of
body
and
mind
she
owed
to
me?
Will
she
forget
what
she
knows
of
my
poor
ambition,
my
sordid
schemes?
Will
she
let
me
expiate
these
things?
Will
she
suffer
me
to
prove
that,
as
I
once
deserted
cruelly,
trifled
wantonly,
injured
basely,
I
can
now
love
faithfully,
cherish
fondly,
treasure
tenderly?"
His
hand
was
in
Caroline's
still;
a
gentle
pressure
answered
him.
"Is
Caroline
mine?"
"Caroline
is
yours."
"I
will
prize
her.
The
sense
of
her
value
is
here,
in
my
heart;
the
necessity
for
her
society
is
blended
with
my
life.
Not
more
jealous
shall
I
be
of
the
blood
whose
flow
moves
my
pulses
than
of
her
happiness
and
well
being."
"I
love
you,
too,
Robert,
and
will
take
faithful
care
of
you."
"Will
you
take
faithful
care
of
me?
Faithful
care!
As
if
that
rose
should
promise
to
shelter
from
tempest
this
hard
gray
stone!
But
she
will
care
for
me,
in
her
way.
These
hands
will
be
the
gentle
ministrants
of
every
comfort
I
can
taste.
I
know
the
being
I
seek
to
entwine
with
my
own
will
bring
me
a
solace,
a
charity,
a
purity,
to
which,
of
myself,
I
am
a
stranger."
Suddenly
Caroline
was
troubled;
her
lip
quivered.
"What
flutters
my
dove?"
asked
Moore,
as
she
nestled
to
and
then
uneasily
shrank
from
him.
"Poor
mamma!
I
am
all
mamma
has.
Must
I
leave
her?"
"Do
you
know,
I
thought
of
that
difficulty.
I
and
'mamma'
have
discussed
it."
"Tell
me
what
you
wish,
what
you
would
like,
and
I
will
consider
if
it
is
possible
to
consent.
But
I
cannot
desert
her,
even
for
you.
I
cannot
break
her
heart,
even
for
your
sake."
"She
was
faithful
when
I
was
false
was
she
not?
I
never
came
near
your
sick
bed,
and
she
watched
it
ceaselessly."
"What
must
I
do?
Anything
but
leave
her."
"At
my
wish
you
never
shall
leave
her."
"She
may
live
very
near
us?"
"With
us
only
she
will
have
her
own
rooms
and
servant.
For
this
she
stipulates
herself."
"You
know
she
has
an
income,
that,
with
her
habits,
makes
her
quite
independent?"
"She
told
me
that,
with
a
gentle
pride
that
reminded
me
of
somebody
else."
"She
is
not
at
all
interfering,
and
incapable
of
gossip."
"I
know
her,
Cary.
But
if,
instead
of
being
the
personification
of
reserve
and
discretion,
she
were
something
quite
opposite,
I
should
not
fear
her."
"Yet
she
will
be
your
mother
in
law?"
The
speaker
gave
an
arch
little
nod.
Moore
smiled.
"Louis
and
I
are
not
of
the
order
of
men
who
fear
their
mothers
in
law,
Cary.
Our
foes
never
have
been,
nor
will
be,
those
of
our
own
household.
I
doubt
not
my
mother
in
law
will
make
much
of
me."
"That
she
will
in
her
quiet
way,
you
know.
She
is
not
demonstrative;
and
when
you
see
her
silent,
or
even
cool,
you
must
not
fancy
her
displeased;
it
is
only
a
manner
she
has.
Be
sure
to
let
me
interpret
for
her
whenever
she
puzzles
you;
always
believe
my
account
of
the
matter,
Robert."
"Oh,
implicitly!
Jesting
apart,
I
feel
that
she
and
I
will
suit
on
ne
peut
mieux.
Hortense,
you
know,
is
exquisitely
susceptible
in
our
French
sense
of
the
word
and
not,
perhaps,
always
reasonable
in
her
requirements;
yet,
dear,
honest
girl,
I
never
painfully
wounded
her
feelings
or
had
a
serious
quarrel
