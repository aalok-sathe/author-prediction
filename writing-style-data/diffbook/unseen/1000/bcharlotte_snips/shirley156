Miss
Keeldar
even
this
negative
excuse
for
her
prejudice.
One
day
she
chanced
to
be
in
the
schoolroom
with
Henry
Sympson,
whose
amiable
and
affectionate
disposition
had
quickly
recommended
him
to
her
regard.
The
boy
was
busied
about
some
mechanical
contrivance;
his
lameness
made
him
fond
of
sedentary
occupation.
He
began
to
ransack
his
tutor's
desk
for
a
piece
of
wax
or
twine
necessary
to
his
work.
Moore
happened
to
be
absent.
Mr.
Hall,
indeed,
had
called
for
him
to
take
a
long
walk.
Henry
could
not
immediately
find
the
object
of
his
search.
He
rummaged
compartment
after
compartment;
and
at
last,
opening
an
inner
drawer,
he
came
upon
not
a
ball
of
cord
or
a
lump
of
beeswax,
but
a
little
bundle
of
small
marble
coloured
cahiers,
tied
with
tape.
Henry
looked
at
them.
"What
rubbish
Mr.
Moore
stores
up
in
his
desk!"
he
said.
"I
hope
he
won't
keep
my
old
exercises
so
carefully."
"What
is
it?"
"Old
copy
books."
He
threw
the
bundle
to
Caroline.
The
packet
looked
so
neat
externally
her
curiosity
was
excited
to
see
its
contents.
"If
they
are
only
copy
books,
I
suppose
I
may
open
them?"
"Oh
yes,
quite
freely.
Mr.
Moore's
desk
is
half
mine
for
he
lets
me
keep
all
sorts
of
things
in
it
and
I
give
you
leave."
On
scrutiny
they
proved
to
be
French
compositions,
written
in
a
hand
peculiar
but
compact,
and
exquisitely
clean
and
clear.
The
writing
was
recognizable.
She
scarcely
needed
the
further
evidence
of
the
name
signed
at
the
close
of
each
theme
to
tell
her
whose
they
were.
Yet
that
name
astonished
her
"Shirley
Keeldar,
Sympson
Grove,
shire"
(a
southern
county),
and
a
date
four
years
back.
She
tied
up
the
packet,
and
held
it
in
her
hand,
meditating
over
it.
She
half
felt
as
if,
in
opening
it,
she
had
violated
a
confidence.
"They
are
Shirley's,
you
see,"
said
Henry
carelessly.
"Did
you
give
them
to
Mr.
Moore?
She
wrote
them
with
Mrs.
Pryor,
I
suppose?"
"She
wrote
them
in
my
schoolroom
at
Sympson
Grove,
when
she
lived
with
us
there.
Mr.
Moore
taught
her
French;
it
is
his
native
language."
"I
know.
Was
she
a
good
pupil,
Henry?"
"She
was
a
wild,
laughing
thing,
but
pleasant
to
have
in
the
room.
She
made
lesson
time
charming.
She
learned
fast
you
could
hardly
tell
when
or
how.
French
was
nothing
to
her.
She
spoke
it
quick,
quick
as
quick
as
Mr.
Moore
himself."
"Was
she
obedient?
Did
she
give
trouble?"
"She
gave
plenty
of
trouble,
in
a
way.
She
was
giddy,
but
I
liked
her.
I'm
desperately
fond
of
Shirley."
"Desperately
fond
you
small
simpleton!
You
don't
know
what
you
say."
"I
am
desperately
fond
of
her.
She
is
the
light
of
my
eyes.
I
said
so
to
Mr.
Moore
last
night."
"He
would
reprove
you
for
speaking
with
exaggeration."
"He
didn't.
He
never
reproves
and
reproves,
as
girls'
governesses
do.
He
was
reading,
and
he
only
smiled
into
his
book,
and
said
that
if
Miss
Keeldar
was
no
more
than
that,
she
was
less
than
he
took
her
to
be;
for
I
was
but
a
dim
eyed,
short
sighted
little
chap.
I'm
afraid
I
am
a
poor
unfortunate,
Miss
Caroline
Helstone.
I
am
a
cripple,
you
know."
"Never
mind,
Henry,
you
are
a
very
nice
little
fellow;
and
if
God
has
not
given
you
health
and
strength,
He
has
given
you
a
good
disposition
and
an
excellent
heart
and
brain."
"I
shall
be
despised.
I
sometimes
think
both
Shirley
and
you
despise
me."
"Listen,
Henry.
Generally,
I
don't
like
schoolboys.
I
have
a
great
horror
of
them.
They
seem
to
me
little
ruffians,
who
take
an
unnatural
delight
in
killing
and
tormenting
birds,
and
insects,
and
kittens,
and
whatever
is
weaker
than
themselves.
But
you
are
so
different
I
am
quite
fond
of
you.
You
have
almost
as
much
sense
as
a
man
(far
more,
God
wot,"
she
muttered
to
herself,
"than
many
men);
you
are
fond
of
reading,
and
you
can
talk
sensibly
about
what
you
read."
"I
am
fond
of
reading.
I
know
I
have
sense,
and
I
know
I
have
feeling."
Miss
Keeldar
here
entered.
"Henry,"
she
said,
"I
have
brought
your
lunch
here.
I
shall
prepare
it
for
you
myself."
She
placed
on
the
table
a
glass
of
new
milk,
a
plate
of
something
which
looked
not
unlike
leather,
and
a
utensil
which
resembled
a
toasting
fork.
"What
are
you
two
about,"
she
continued,
"ransacking
Mr.
Moore's
desk?"
"Looking
at
your
old
copy
books,"
returned
Caroline.
"My
old
copy
books?"
"French
exercise
books.
Look
here!
They
must
be
held
precious;
they
are
kept
carefully."
She
showed
the
bundle.
Shirley
snatched
it
up.
"Did
not
know
one
was
in
existence,"
she
said.
"I
thought
the
whole
lot
had
long
since
lit
the
kitchen
fire,
or
curled
the
maid's
hair
at
Sympson
Grove.
What
made
you
keep
them,
Henry?"
"It
is
not
my
doing.
I
should
not
have
thought
of
it.
It
never
entered
my
head
to
suppose
copy
books
of
value.
Mr.
Moore
put
them
by
in
the
inner
drawer
of
his
desk.
Perhaps
he
forgot
them."
"C'est
cela.
He
forgot
them,
no
doubt,"
echoed
Shirley.
"They
are
extremely
well
written,"
she
observed
complacently.
"What
a
giddy
girl
you
were,
Shirley,
in
those
days!
I
remember
you
so
well.
A
slim,
light
creature
whom,
though
you
were
so
tall,
I
could
lift
off
the
floor.
I
see
you
with
your
long,
countless
curls
on
your
shoulders,
and
your
streaming
sash.
You
used
to
make
Mr.
Moore
lively
that
is,
at
first.
I
believe
you
grieved
him
after
a
while."
Shirley
turned
the
closely
written
pages
and
said
nothing.
Presently
she
observed,
"That
was
written
one
winter
afternoon.
It
was
a
description
of
a
snow
scene."
"I
remember,"
said
Henry.
"Mr.
Moore,
when
he
read
it,
cried,
'Voila
le
Francais
gagne!'
He
said
it
was
well
done.
Afterwards
you
made
him
draw,
in
sepia,
the
landscape
you
described."
