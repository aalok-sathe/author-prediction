me."
"Caroline,"
demanded
Miss
Keeldar
abruptly,
"don't
you
wish
you
had
a
profession
a
trade?"
"I
wish
it
fifty
times
a
day.
As
it
is,
I
often
wonder
what
I
came
into
the
world
for.
I
long
to
have
something
absorbing
and
compulsory
to
fill
my
head
and
hands
and
to
occupy
my
thoughts."
"Can
labour
alone
make
a
human
being
happy?"
"No;
but
it
can
give
varieties
of
pain,
and
prevent
us
from
breaking
our
hearts
with
a
single
tyrant
master
torture.
Besides,
successful
labour
has
its
recompense;
a
vacant,
weary,
lonely,
hopeless
life
has
none."
"But
hard
labour
and
learned
professions,
they
say,
make
women
masculine,
coarse,
unwomanly."
"And
what
does
it
signify
whether
unmarried
and
never
to
be
married
women
are
unattractive
and
inelegant
or
not?
Provided
only
they
are
decent,
decorous,
and
neat,
it
is
enough.
The
utmost
which
ought
to
be
required
of
old
maids,
in
the
way
of
appearance,
is
that
they
should
not
absolutely
offend
men's
eyes
as
they
pass
them
in
the
street;
for
the
rest,
they
should
be
allowed,
without
too
much
scorn,
to
be
as
absorbed,
grave,
plain
looking,
and
plain
dressed
as
they
please."
"You
might
be
an
old
maid
yourself,
Caroline,
you
speak
so
earnestly."
"I
shall
be
one.
It
is
my
destiny.
I
will
never
marry
a
Malone
or
a
Sykes;
and
no
one
else
will
ever
marry
me."
Here
fell
a
long
pause.
Shirley
broke
it.
Again
the
name
by
which
she
seemed
bewitched
was
almost
the
first
on
her
lips.
"Lina
did
not
Moore
call
you
Lina
sometimes?"
"Yes.
It
is
sometimes
used
as
the
abbreviation
of
Caroline
in
his
native
country."
"Well,
Lina,
do
you
remember
my
one
day
noticing
an
inequality
in
your
hair
a
curl
wanting
on
that
right
side
and
your
telling
me
that
it
was
Robert's
fault,
as
he
had
once
cut
therefrom
a
long
lock?"
"Yes."
"If
he
is,
and
always
was,
as
indifferent
to
you
as
you
say,
why
did
he
steal
your
hair?"
"I
don't
know
yes,
I
do.
It
was
my
doing,
not
his.
Everything
of
that
sort
always
was
my
doing.
He
was
going
from
home
to
London,
as
usual;
and
the
night
before
he
went,
I
had
found
in
his
sister's
workbox
a
lock
of
black
hair
a
short,
round
curl.
Hortense
told
me
it
was
her
brother's,
and
a
keepsake.
He
was
sitting
near
the
table.
I
looked
at
his
head.
He
has
plenty
of
hair;
on
the
temples
were
many
such
round
curls.
I
thought
he
could
spare
me
one.
I
knew
I
should
like
to
have
it,
and
I
asked
for
it.
He
said,
on
condition
that
he
might
have
his
choice
of
a
tress
from
my
head.
So
he
got
one
of
my
long
locks
of
hair,
and
I
got
one
of
his
short
ones.
I
keep
his,
but
I
dare
say
he
has
lost
mine.
It
was
my
doing,
and
one
of
those
silly
deeds
it
distresses
the
heart
and
sets
the
face
on
fire
to
think
of;
one
of
those
small
but
sharp
recollections
that
return,
lacerating
your
self
respect
like
tiny
penknives,
and
forcing
from
your
lips,
as
you
sit
alone,
sudden,
insane
sounding
interjections."
"Caroline!"
"I
do
think
myself
a
fool,
Shirley,
in
some
respects;
I
do
despise
myself.
But
I
said
I
would
not
make
you
my
confessor,
for
you
cannot
reciprocate
foible
for
foible;
you
are
not
weak.
How
steadily
you
watch
me
now!
Turn
aside
your
clear,
strong,
she
eagle
eye;
it
is
an
insult
to
fix
it
on
me
thus."
"What
a
study
of
character
you
are
weak,
certainly,
but
not
in
the
sense
you
think!
Come
in!"
This
was
said
in
answer
to
a
tap
at
the
door.
Miss
Keeldar
happened
to
be
near
it
at
the
moment,
Caroline
at
the
other
end
of
the
room.
She
saw
a
note
put
into
Shirley's
hands,
and
heard
the
words,
"From
Mr.
Moore,
ma'am."
"Bring
candles,"
said
Miss
Keeldar.
Caroline
sat
expectant.
"A
communication
on
business,"
said
the
heiress;
but
when
candles
were
brought,
she
neither
opened
nor
read
it.
The
rector's
Fanny
was
presently
announced,
and
the
rector's
niece
went
home.
In
Shirley's
nature
prevailed
at
times
an
easy
indolence.
There
were
periods
when
she
took
delight
in
perfect
vacancy
of
hand
and
eye
moments
when
her
thoughts,
her
simple
existence,
the
fact
of
the
world
being
around
and
heaven
above
her,
seemed
to
yield
her
such
fullness
of
happiness
that
she
did
not
need
to
lift
a
finger
to
increase
the
joy.
Often,
after
an
active
morning,
she
would
spend
a
sunny
afternoon
in
lying
stirless
on
the
turf,
at
the
foot
of
some
tree
of
friendly
umbrage.
No
society
did
she
need
but
that
of
Caroline,
and
it
sufficed
if
she
were
within
call;
no
spectacle
did
she
ask
but
that
of
the
deep
blue
sky,
and
such
cloudlets
as
sailed
afar
and
aloft
across
its
span;
no
sound
but
that
of
the
bee's
hum,
the
leaf's
whisper.
Her
sole
book
in
such
hours
was
the
dim
chronicle
of
memory
or
the
sibyl
page
of
anticipation.
From
her
young
eyes
fell
on
each
volume
a
glorious
light
to
read
by;
round
her
lips
at
moments
played
a
smile
which
revealed
glimpses
of
the
tale
or
prophecy.
It
was
not
sad,
not
dark.
Fate
had
been
benign
to
the
blissful
dreamer,
and
promised
to
favour
her
yet
again.
In
her
past
were
sweet
passages,
in
her
future
rosy
hopes.
Yet
one
day
when
Caroline
drew
near
to
rouse
her,
thinking
she
had
lain
long
enough,
behold,
as
she
looked
down,
Shirley's
cheek
was
wet
as
if
with
dew;
those
fine
eyes
of
hers
shone
humid
and
brimming.
"Shirley,
why
do
you
cry?"
asked
Caroline,
involuntarily
laying
stress
on
you.
Miss
Keeldar
smiled,
and
turned
her
picturesque
head
towards
the
questioner.
"Because
it
pleases
me
mightily
to
cry,"
she
said.
"My
heart
is
both
sad
and
glad.
But
why,
you
good,
patient
