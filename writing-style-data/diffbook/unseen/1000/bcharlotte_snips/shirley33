dangerous
waters,
sweeter
flowers,
more
tempting
fruits,
wider
plains,
drearier
deserts,
sunnier
fields
than
are
found
in
nature,
overspread
our
enchanted
globe.
What
a
moon
we
gaze
on
before
that
time!
How
the
trembling
of
our
hearts
at
her
aspect
bears
witness
to
its
unutterable
beauty!
As
to
our
sun,
it
is
a
burning
heaven
the
world
of
gods.
At
that
time,
at
eighteen,
drawing
near
the
confines
of
illusive,
void
dreams,
Elf
land
lies
behind
us,
the
shores
of
Reality
rise
in
front.
These
shores
are
yet
distant;
they
look
so
blue,
soft,
gentle,
we
long
to
reach
them.
In
sunshine
we
see
a
greenness
beneath
the
azure,
as
of
spring
meadows;
we
catch
glimpses
of
silver
lines,
and
imagine
the
roll
of
living
waters.
Could
we
but
reach
this
land,
we
think
to
hunger
and
thirst
no
more;
whereas
many
a
wilderness,
and
often
the
flood
of
death,
or
some
stream
of
sorrow
as
cold
and
almost
as
black
as
death,
is
to
be
crossed
ere
true
bliss
can
be
tasted.
Every
joy
that
life
gives
must
be
earned
ere
it
is
secured;
and
how
hardly
earned,
those
only
know
who
have
wrestled
for
great
prizes.
The
heart's
blood
must
gem
with
red
beads
the
brow
of
the
combatant,
before
the
wreath
of
victory
rustles
over
it.
At
eighteen
we
are
not
aware
of
this.
Hope,
when
she
smiles
on
us,
and
promises
happiness
to
morrow,
is
implicitly
believed;
Love,
when
he
comes
wandering
like
a
lost
angel
to
our
door,
is
at
once
admitted,
welcomed,
embraced.
His
quiver
is
not
seen;
if
his
arrows
penetrate,
their
wound
is
like
a
thrill
of
new
life.
There
are
no
fears
of
poison,
none
of
the
barb
which
no
leech's
hand
can
extract.
That
perilous
passion
an
agony
ever
in
some
of
its
phases;
with
many,
an
agony
throughout
is
believed
to
be
an
unqualified
good.
In
short,
at
eighteen
the
school
of
experience
is
to
be
entered,
and
her
humbling,
crushing,
grinding,
but
yet
purifying
and
invigorating
lessons
are
yet
to
be
learned.
Alas,
Experience!
No
other
mentor
has
so
wasted
and
frozen
a
face
as
yours,
none
wears
a
robe
so
black,
none
bears
a
rod
so
heavy,
none
with
hand
so
inexorable
draws
the
novice
so
sternly
to
his
task,
and
forces
him
with
authority
so
resistless
to
its
acquirement.
It
is
by
your
instructions
alone
that
man
or
woman
can
ever
find
a
safe
track
through
life's
wilds;
without
it,
how
they
stumble,
how
they
stray!
On
what
forbidden
grounds
do
they
intrude,
down
what
dread
declivities
are
they
hurled!
Caroline,
having
been
convoyed
home
by
Robert,
had
no
wish
to
pass
what
remained
of
the
evening
with
her
uncle.
The
room
in
which
he
sat
was
very
sacred
ground
to
her;
she
seldom
intruded
on
it;
and
to
night
she
kept
aloof
till
the
bell
rang
for
prayers.
Part
of
the
evening
church
service
was
the
form
of
worship
observed
in
Mr.
Helstone's
household.
He
read
it
in
his
usual
nasal
voice,
clear,
loud,
and
monotonous.
The
rite
over,
his
niece,
according
to
her
wont,
stepped
up
to
him.
"Good
night,
uncle."
"Hey!
You've
been
gadding
abroad
all
day
visiting,
dining
out,
and
what
not!"
"Only
at
the
cottage."
"And
have
you
learned
your
lessons?"
"Yes."
"And
made
a
shirt?"
"Only
part
of
one."
"Well,
that
will
do.
Stick
to
the
needle,
learn
shirt
making
and
gown
making
and
piecrust
making,
and
you'll
be
a
clever
woman
some
day.
Go
to
bed
now.
I'm
busy
with
a
pamphlet
here."
Presently
the
niece
was
enclosed
in
her
small
bedroom,
the
door
bolted,
her
white
dressing
gown
assumed,
her
long
hair
loosened
and
falling
thick,
soft,
and
wavy
to
her
waist;
and
as,
resting
from
the
task
of
combing
it
out,
she
leaned
her
check
on
her
hand
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
carpet,
before
her
rose,
and
close
around
her
drew,
the
visions
we
see
at
eighteen
years.
Her
thoughts
were
speaking
with
her,
speaking
pleasantly,
as
it
seemed,
for
she
smiled
as
she
listened.
She
looked
pretty
meditating
thus;
but
a
brighter
thing
than
she
was
in
that
apartment
the
spirit
of
youthful
Hope.
According
to
this
flattering
prophet,
she
was
to
know
disappointment,
to
feel
chill
no
more;
she
had
entered
on
the
dawn
of
a
summer
day
no
false
dawn,
but
the
true
spring
of
morning
and
her
sun
would
quickly
rise.
Impossible
for
her
now
to
suspect
that
she
was
the
sport
of
delusion;
her
expectations
seemed
warranted,
the
foundation
on
which
they
rested
appeared
solid.
"When
people
love,
the
next
step
is
they
marry,"
was
her
argument.
"Now,
I
love
Robert,
and
I
feel
sure
that
Robert
loves
me.
I
have
thought
so
many
a
time
before;
to
day
I
felt
it.
When
I
looked
up
at
him
after
repeating
Chenier's
poem,
his
eyes
(what
handsome
eyes
he
has!)
sent
the
truth
through
my
heart.
Sometimes
I
am
afraid
to
speak
to
him,
lest
I
should
be
too
frank,
lest
I
should
seem
forward
for
I
have
more
than
once
regretted
bitterly
overflowing,
superfluous
words,
and
feared
I
had
said
more
than
he
expected
me
to
say,
and
that
he
would
disapprove
what
he
might
deem
my
indiscretion;
now,
to
night
I
could
have
ventured
to
express
any
thought,
he
was
so
indulgent.
How
kind
he
was
as
we
walked
up
the
lane!
He
does
not
flatter
or
say
foolish
things;
his
love
making
(friendship,
I
mean;
of
course
I
don't
yet
account
him
my
lover,
but
I
hope
he
will
be
so
some
day)
is
not
like
what
we
read
of
in
books,
it
is
far
better
original,
quiet,
manly,
sincere.
I
do
like
him;
I
would
be
an
excellent
wife
to
him
if
he
did
marry
me;
I
would
tell
him
of
his
faults
(for
he
has
a
few
faults),
but
I
would
study
his
comfort,
and
cherish
him,
and
do
my
best
to
make
him
happy.
Now,
