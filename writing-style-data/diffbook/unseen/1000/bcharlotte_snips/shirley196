from
that
chateau
on
the
Scheldt
Miss
Moore
talks
about."
"Martin,"
said
the
softest
whisper
at
the
door,
"don't
be
foolish."
"Is
she
there?"
inquired
Moore
hastily.
He
had
caught
an
imperfect
sound.
"She
is
there,
fit
to
faint.
She
is
standing
on
the
mat,
shocked
at
your
want
of
filial
affection."
"Martin,
you
are
an
evil
cross
between
an
imp
and
a
page.
What
is
she
like?"
"More
like
me
than
you;
for
she
is
young
and
beautiful."
"You
are
to
show
her
forward.
Do
you
hear?"
"Come,
Miss
Caroline."
"Miss
Caroline!"
repeated
Moore.
And
when
Miss
Caroline
entered
she
was
encountered
in
the
middle
of
the
chamber
by
a
tall,
thin,
wasted
figure,
who
took
both
her
hands.
"I
give
you
a
quarter
of
an
hour,"
said
Martin,
as
he
withdrew,
"no
more.
Say
what
you
have
to
say
in
that
time.
Till
it
is
past
I
will
wait
in
the
gallery;
nothing
shall
approach;
I'll
see
you
safe
away.
Should
you
persist
in
staying
longer,
I
leave
you
to
your
fate."
He
shut
the
door.
In
the
gallery
he
was
as
elate
as
a
king.
He
had
never
been
engaged
in
an
adventure
he
liked
so
well,
for
no
adventure
had
ever
invested
him
with
so
much
importance
or
inspired
him
with
so
much
interest.
"You
are
come
at
last,"
said
the
meagre
man,
gazing
on
his
visitress
with
hollow
eyes.
"Did
you
expect
me
before?"
"For
a
month,
near
two
months,
we
have
been
very
near;
and
I
have
been
in
sad
pain,
and
danger,
and
misery,
Cary."
"I
could
not
come."
"Couldn't
you?
But
the
rectory
and
Briarmains
are
very
near
not
two
miles
apart."
There
was
pain
and
there
was
pleasure
in
the
girl's
face
as
she
listened
to
these
implied
reproaches.
It
was
sweet,
it
was
bitter
to
defend
herself.
"When
I
say
I
could
not
come,
I
mean
I
could
not
see
you;
for
I
came
with
mamma
the
very
day
we
heard
what
had
happened.
Mr.
MacTurk
then
told
us
it
was
impossible
to
admit
any
stranger."
"But
afterwards
every
fine
afternoon
these
many
weeks
past
I
have
waited
and
listened.
Something
here,
Cary"
laying
his
hand
on
his
breast
"told
me
it
was
impossible
but
that
you
should
think
of
me.
Not
that
I
merit
thought;
but
we
are
old
acquaintance
we
are
cousins."
"I
came
again,
Robert;
mamma
and
I
came
again."
"Did
you?
Come,
that
is
worth
hearing.
Since
you
came
again,
we
will
sit
down
and
talk
about
it."
They
sat
down.
Caroline
drew
her
chair
up
to
his.
The
air
was
now
dark
with
snow;
an
Iceland
blast
was
driving
it
wildly.
This
pair
neither
heard
the
long
"wuthering"
rush,
nor
saw
the
white
burden
it
drifted.
Each
seemed
conscious
but
of
one
thing
the
presence
of
the
other.
"So
mamma
and
you
came
again?"
"And
Mrs.
Yorke
did
treat
us
strangely.
We
asked
to
see
you.
'No,'
said
she,
'not
in
my
house.
I
am
at
present
responsible
for
his
life;
it
shall
not
be
forfeited
for
half
an
hour's
idle
gossip.'
But
I
must
not
tell
you
all
she
said;
it
was
very
disagreeable.
However,
we
came
yet
again
mamma,
Miss
Keeldar,
and
I.
This
time
we
thought
we
should
conquer,
as
we
were
three
against
one,
and
Shirley
was
on
our
side.
But
Mrs.
Yorke
opened
such
a
battery."
Moore
smiled.
"What
did
she
say?"
"Things
that
astonished
us.
Shirley
laughed
at
last;
I
cried;
mamma
was
seriously
annoyed.
We
were
all
three
driven
from
the
field.
Since
that
time
I
have
only
walked
once
a
day
past
the
house,
just
for
the
satisfaction
of
looking
up
at
your
window,
which
I
could
distinguish
by
the
drawn
curtains.
I
really
dared
not
come
in."
"I
have
wished
for
you,
Caroline."
"I
did
not
know
that;
I
never
dreamt
one
instant
that
you
thought
of
me.
If
I
had
but
most
distantly
imagined
such
a
possibility
"
"Mrs.
Yorke
would
still
have
beaten
you."
"She
would
not.
Stratagem
should
have
been
tried,
if
persuasion
failed.
I
would
have
come
to
the
kitchen
door;
the
servants
should
have
let
me
in,
and
I
would
have
walked
straight
upstairs.
In
fact,
it
was
far
more
the
fear
of
intrusion
the
fear
of
yourself
that
baffled
me
than
the
fear
of
Mrs.
Yorke."
"Only
last
night
I
despaired
of
ever
seeing
you
again.
Weakness
has
wrought
terrible
depression
in
me
terrible
depression."
"And
you
sit
alone?"
"Worse
than
alone."
"But
you
must
be
getting
better,
since
you
can
leave
your
bed?"
"I
doubt
whether
I
shall
live.
I
see
nothing
for
it,
after
such
exhaustion,
but
decline."
"You
you
shall
go
home
to
the
Hollow."
"Dreariness
would
accompany,
nothing
cheerful
come
near
me."
"I
will
alter
this.
This
shall
be
altered,
were
there
ten
Mrs.
Yorkes
to
do
battle
with."
"Cary,
you
make
me
smile."
"Do
smile;
smile
again.
Shall
I
tell
you
what
I
should
like?"
"Tell
me
anything
only
keep
talking.
I
am
Saul;
but
for
music
I
should
perish."
"I
should
like
you
to
be
brought
to
the
rectory,
and
given
to
me
and
mamma."
"A
precious
gift!
I
have
not
laughed
since
they
shot
me
till
now."
"Do
you
suffer
pain,
Robert?"
"Not
so
much
pain
now;
but
I
am
hopelessly
weak,
and
the
state
of
my
mind
is
inexpressible
dark,
barren,
impotent.
Do
you
not
read
it
all
in
my
face?
I
look
a
mere
ghost."
"Altered;
yet
I
should
have
known
you
anywhere.
But
I
understand
your
feelings;
I
experienced
something
like
it.
Since
we
met,
I
too
have
been
very
ill."
"Very
ill?"
"I
thought
I
should
die.
The
tale
of
my
life
seemed
told.
Every
night,
just
at
midnight,
I
used
to
wake
from
awful
dreams;
and
the
book
lay
open
before
me
at
the
last
page,
where
was
written
'Finis.'
I
had
strange
feelings."
"You
speak
my
experience."
"I
believed
I
should
never
see
you
again;
and
I
