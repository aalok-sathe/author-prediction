number
was
Mr.
Sympson.
"I
disappointed?
What
is
it
to
me?
Have
I
an
interest
in
it?
You
would
insinuate,
perhaps,
that
I
have
motives?"
"Most
people
have
motives
of
some
sort
for
their
actions."
"She
accuses
me
to
my
face!
I,
that
have
been
a
parent
to
her,
she
charges
with
bad
motives!"
"Bad
motives
I
did
not
say."
"And
now
you
prevaricate;
you
have
no
principles!"
"Uncle,
you
tire
me.
I
want
to
go
away."
"Go
you
shall
not!
I
will
be
answered.
What
are
your
intentions,
Miss
Keeldar?"
"In
what
respect?"
"In
respect
of
matrimony?"
"To
be
quiet,
and
to
do
just
as
I
please."
"Just
as
you
please!
The
words
are
to
the
last
degree
indecorous."
"Mr.
Sympson,
I
advise
you
not
to
become
insulting.
You
know
I
will
not
bear
that."
"You
read
French.
Your
mind
is
poisoned
with
French
novels.
You
have
imbibed
French
principles."
"The
ground
you
are
treading
now
returns
a
mighty
hollow
sound
under
your
feet.
Beware!"
"It
will
end
in
infamy,
sooner
or
later.
I
have
foreseen
it
all
along."
"Do
you
assert,
sir,
that
something
in
which
I
am
concerned
will
end
in
infamy?"
"That
it
will
that
it
will.
You
said
just
now
you
would
act
as
you
please.
You
acknowledge
no
rules
no
limitations."
"Silly
stuff,
and
vulgar
as
silly!"
"Regardless
of
decorum,
you
are
prepared
to
fly
in
the
face
of
propriety."
"You
tire
me,
uncle."
"What,
madam
what
could
be
your
reasons
for
refusing
Sir
Philip?"
"At
last
there
is
another
sensible
question;
I
shall
be
glad
to
reply
to
it.
Sir
Philip
is
too
young
for
me.
I
regard
him
as
a
boy.
All
his
relations
his
mother
especially
would
be
annoyed
if
he
married
me.
Such
a
step
would
embroil
him
with
them.
I
am
not
his
equal
in
the
world's
estimation."
"Is
that
all?"
"Our
dispositions
are
not
compatible."
"Why,
a
more
amiable
gentleman
never
breathed."
"He
is
very
amiable
very
excellent
truly
estimable;
but
not
my
master
not
in
one
point.
I
could
not
trust
myself
with
his
happiness.
I
would
not
undertake
the
keeping
of
it
for
thousands.
I
will
accept
no
hand
which
cannot
hold
me
in
check."
"I
thought
you
liked
to
do
as
you
please.
You
are
vastly
inconsistent."
"When
I
promise
to
obey,
it
shall
be
under
the
conviction
that
I
can
keep
that
promise.
I
could
not
obey
a
youth
like
Sir
Philip.
Besides,
he
would
never
command
me.
He
would
expect
me
always
to
rule
to
guide
and
I
have
no
taste
whatever
for
the
office."
"You
no
taste
for
swaggering,
and
subduing,
and
ordering,
and
ruling?"
"Not
my
husband;
only
my
uncle."
"Where
is
the
difference?"
"There
is
a
slight
difference
that
is
certain.
And
I
know
full
well
any
man
who
wishes
to
live
in
decent
comfort
with
me
as
a
husband
must
be
able
to
control
me."
"I
wish
you
had
a
real
tyrant."
"A
tyrant
would
not
hold
me
for
a
day,
not
for
an
hour.
I
would
rebel
break
from
him
defy
him."
"Are
you
not
enough
to
bewilder
one's
brain
with
your
self
contradiction?"
"It
is
evident
I
bewilder
your
brain."
"You
talk
of
Sir
Philip
being
young.
He
is
two
and
twenty."
"My
husband
must
be
thirty,
with
the
sense
of
forty."
"You
had
better
pick
out
some
old
man
some
white
headed
or
bald
headed
swain."
"No,
thank
you."
"You
could
lead
some
doting
fool;
you
might
pin
him
to
your
apron."
"I
might
do
that
with
a
boy;
but
it
is
not
my
vocation.
Did
I
not
say
I
prefer
a
master
one
in
whose
presence
I
shall
feel
obliged
and
disposed
to
be
good;
one
whose
control
my
impatient
temper
must
acknowledge;
a
man
whose
approbation
can
reward,
whose
displeasure
punish
me;
a
man
I
shall
feel
it
impossible
not
to
love,
and
very
possible
to
fear?"
"What
is
there
to
hinder
you
from
doing
all
this
with
Sir
Philip?
He
is
a
baronet
a
man
of
rank,
property,
connections
far
above
yours.
If
you
talk
of
intellect,
he
is
a
poet
he
writes
verses;
which
you,
I
take
it,
cannot
do,
with
all
your
cleverness."
"Neither
his
title,
wealth,
pedigree,
nor
poetry
avail
to
invest
him
with
the
power
I
describe.
These
are
feather
weights;
they
want
ballast.
A
measure
of
sound,
solid,
practical
sense
would
have
stood
him
in
better
stead
with
me."
"You
and
Henry
rave
about
poetry!
You
used
to
catch
fire
like
tinder
on
the
subject
when
you
were
a
girl."
"O
uncle,
there
is
nothing
really
valuable
in
this
world,
there
is
nothing
glorious
in
the
world
to
come
that
is
not
poetry!"
"Marry
a
poet,
then,
in
God's
name!"
"Show
him
me,
and
I
will."
"Sir
Philip."
"Not
at
all.
You
are
almost
as
good
a
poet
as
he."
"Madam,
you
are
wandering
from
the
point."
"Indeed,
uncle,
I
wanted
to
do
so,
and
I
shall
be
glad
to
lead
you
away
with
me.
Do
not
let
us
get
out
of
temper
with
each
other;
it
is
not
worth
while."
"Out
of
temper,
Miss
Keeldar!
I
should
be
glad
to
know
who
is
out
of
temper."
"I
am
not,
yet."
"If
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
I
am,
I
consider
that
you
are
guilty
of
impertinence."
"You
will
be
soon,
if
you
go
on
at
that
rate."
"There
it
is!
With
your
pert
tongue
you
would
try
the
patience
of
a
Job."
"I
know
I
should."
"No
levity,
miss!
This
is
not
a
laughing
matter.
It
is
an
affair
I
am
resolved
to
probe
thoroughly,
convinced
that
there
is
mischief
at
the
bottom.
You
described
just
now,
with
far
too
much
freedom
for
your
years
and
sex,
the
sort
of
individual
you
would
prefer
as
a
husband.
Pray,
did
you
paint
from
the
life?"
Shirley
opened
her
lips,
but
instead
of
speaking
she
only
glowed
rose
red.
"I
shall
have
an
answer
to
that
question,"
affirmed
Mr.
