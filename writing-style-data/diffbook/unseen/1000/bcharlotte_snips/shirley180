When
others
uttered
it
she
changed
countenance
I
know
she
did.
She
pronounced
it
herself
in
the
most
musical
of
her
many
musical
tones.
She
was
cordial
to
me;
she
took
an
interest
in
me;
she
was
anxious
about
me;
she
wished
me
well;
she
sought,
she
seized
every
opportunity
to
benefit
me.
I
considered,
paused,
watched,
weighed,
wondered.
I
could
come
to
but
one
conclusion
this
is
love.
"I
looked
at
her,
Yorke.
I
saw
in
her
youth
and
a
species
of
beauty.
I
saw
power
in
her.
Her
wealth
offered
me
the
redemption
of
my
honour
and
my
standing.
I
owed
her
gratitude.
She
had
aided
me
substantially
and
effectually
by
a
loan
of
five
thousand
pounds.
Could
I
remember
these
things?
Could
I
believe
she
loved
me?
Could
I
hear
wisdom
urge
me
to
marry
her,
and
disregard
every
dear
advantage,
disbelieve
every
flattering
suggestion,
disdain
every
well
weighed
counsel,
turn
and
leave
her?
Young,
graceful,
gracious
my
benefactress,
attached
to
me,
enamoured
of
me.
I
used
to
say
so
to
myself;
dwell
on
the
word;
mouth
it
over
and
over
again;
swell
over
it
with
a
pleasant,
pompous
complacency,
with
an
admiration
dedicated
entirely
to
myself,
and
unimpaired
even
by
esteem
for
her;
indeed
I
smiled
in
deep
secrecy
at
her
naivete
and
simplicity
in
being
the
first
to
love,
and
to
show
it.
That
whip
of
yours
seems
to
have
a
good
heavy
handle,
Yorke;
you
can
swing
it
about
your
head
and
knock
me
out
of
the
saddle,
if
you
choose.
I
should
rather
relish
a
loundering
whack."
"Tak
patience,
Robert,
till
the
moon
rises
and
I
can
see
you.
Speak
plain
out
did
you
love
her
or
not?
I
could
like
to
know.
I
feel
curious."
"Sir
sir
I
say
she
is
very
pretty,
in
her
own
style,
and
very
attractive.
She
has
a
look,
at
times,
of
a
thing
made
out
of
fire
and
air,
at
which
I
stand
and
marvel,
without
a
thought
of
clasping
and
kissing
it.
I
felt
in
her
a
powerful
magnet
to
my
interest
and
vanity.
I
never
felt
as
if
nature
meant
her
to
be
my
other
and
better
self.
When
a
question
on
that
head
rushed
upon
me,
I
flung
it
off,
saying
brutally
I
should
be
rich
with
her
and
ruined
without
her
vowing
I
would
be
practical,
and
not
romantic."
"A
very
sensible
resolve.
What
mischief
came
of
it,
Bob?"
"With
this
sensible
resolve
I
walked
up
to
Fieldhead
one
night
last
August.
It
was
the
very
eve
of
my
departure
for
Birmingham;
for,
you
see,
I
wanted
to
secure
Fortune's
splendid
prize.
I
had
previously
dispatched
a
note
requesting
a
private
interview.
I
found
her
at
home,
and
alone.
"She
received
me
without
embarrassment,
for
she
thought
I
came
on
business.
I
was
embarrassed
enough,
but
determined.
I
hardly
know
how
I
got
the
operation
over;
but
I
went
to
work
in
a
hard,
firm
fashion
frightful
enough,
I
dare
say.
I
sternly
offered
myself
my
fine
person
with
my
debts,
of
course,
as
a
settlement.
"It
vexed
me,
it
kindled
my
ire,
to
find
that
she
neither
blushed,
trembled,
nor
looked
down.
She
responded,
'I
doubt
whether
I
have
understood
you,
Mr.
Moore.'
"And
I
had
to
go
over
the
whole
proposal
twice,
and
word
it
as
plainly
as
A
B
C,
before
she
would
fully
take
it
in.
And
then,
what
did
she
do?
Instead
of
faltering
a
sweet
Yes,
or
maintaining
a
soft,
confused
silence
(which
would
have
been
as
good),
she
started
up,
walked
twice
fast
through
the
room,
in
the
way
that
she
only
does,
and
no
other
woman,
and
ejaculated,
'God
bless
me!'
"Yorke,
I
stood
on
the
hearth,
backed
by
the
mantelpiece;
against
it
I
leaned,
and
prepared
for
anything
everything.
I
knew
my
doom,
and
I
knew
myself.
There
was
no
misunderstanding
her
aspect
and
voice.
She
stopped
and
looked
at
me.
"'God
bless
me!'
she
piteously
repeated,
in
that
shocked,
indignant,
yet
saddened
accent.
'You
have
made
a
strange
proposal
strange
from
you;
and
if
you
knew
how
strangely
you
worded
it
and
looked
it,
you
would
be
startled
at
yourself.
You
spoke
like
a
brigand
who
demanded
my
purse
rather
than
like
a
lover
who
asked
my
heart.'
"A
queer
sentence,
was
it
not,
Yorke?
And
I
knew,
as
she
uttered
it,
it
was
true
as
queer.
Her
words
were
a
mirror
in
which
I
saw
myself.
"I
looked
at
her,
dumb
and
wolfish.
She
at
once
enraged
and
shamed
me.
"'Gerard
Moore,
you
know
you
don't
love
Shirley
Keeldar.'
I
might
have
broken
out
into
false
swearing
vowed
that
I
did
love
her;
but
I
could
not
lie
in
her
pure
face.
I
could
not
perjure
myself
in
her
truthful
presence.
Besides,
such
hollow
oaths
would
have
been
vain
as
void.
She
would
no
more
have
believed
me
than
she
would
have
believed
the
ghost
of
Judas,
had
he
broken
from
the
night
and
stood
before
her.
Her
female
heart
had
finer
perceptions
than
to
be
cheated
into
mistaking
my
half
coarse,
half
cold
admiration
for
true
throbbing,
manly
love.
"What
next
happened?
you
will
say,
Mr.
Yorke.
"Why,
she
sat
down
in
the
window
seat
and
cried.
She
cried
passionately.
Her
eyes
not
only
rained
but
lightened.
They
flashed,
open,
large,
dark,
haughty,
upon
me.
They
said,
'You
have
pained
me;
you
have
outraged
me;
you
have
deceived
me.'
"She
added
words
soon
to
looks.
"'I
did
respect
I
did
admire
I
did
like
you,'
she
said
'yes,
as
much
as
if
you
were
my
brother;
and
you
you
want
to
make
a
speculation
of
me.
You
would
immolate
me
to
that
mill,
your
Moloch!'
"I
had
the
common
sense
to
abstain
from
any
word
of
excuse,
any
attempt
at
palliation.
I
stood
to
be
scorned.
"Sold
to
the
devil
for
the
time
being,
I
was
certainly
infatuated.
When
I
did
speak,
what
do
you
think
I
said?
"'Whatever
my
