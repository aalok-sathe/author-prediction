on
the
white
marble.
There
is
plenty
of
room
for
other
inscriptions
underneath."
"William
Farren
came
to
look
after
your
flowers
this
morning.
He
was
afraid,
now
you
cannot
tend
them
yourself,
they
would
be
neglected.
He
has
taken
two
of
your
favourite
plants
home
to
nurse
for
you."
"If
I
were
to
make
a
will,
I
would
leave
William
all
my
plants;
Shirley
my
trinkets
except
one,
which
must
not
be
taken
off
my
neck;
and
you,
ma'am,
my
books."
After
a
pause
"Mrs.
Pryor,
I
feel
a
longing
wish
for
something."
"For
what,
Caroline?"
"You
know
I
always
delight
to
hear
you
sing.
Sing
me
a
hymn
just
now.
Sing
that
hymn
which
begins,
'Our
God,
our
help
in
ages
past,
Our
hope
for
years
to
come,
Our
shelter
from
the
stormy
blast,
Our
refuge,
haven,
home!'"
Mrs.
Pryor
at
once
complied.
No
wonder
Caroline
liked
to
hear
her
sing.
Her
voice,
even
in
speaking,
was
sweet
and
silver
clear;
in
song
it
was
almost
divine.
Neither
flute
nor
dulcimer
has
tones
so
pure.
But
the
tone
was
secondary,
compared
to
the
expression
which
trembled
through
a
tender
vibration
from
a
feeling
heart.
The
servants
in
the
kitchen,
hearing
the
strain,
stole
to
the
stair
foot
to
listen.
Even
old
Helstone,
as
he
walked
in
the
garden,
pondering
over
the
unaccountable
and
feeble
nature
of
women,
stood
still
amongst
his
borders
to
catch
the
mournful
melody
more
distinctly.
Why
it
reminded
him
of
his
forgotten
dead
wife,
he
could
not
tell;
nor
why
it
made
him
more
concerned
than
he
had
hitherto
been
for
Caroline's
fading
girlhood.
He
was
glad
to
recollect
that
he
had
promised
to
pay
Wynne,
the
magistrate,
a
visit
that
evening.
Low
spirits
and
gloomy
thoughts
were
very
much
his
aversion.
When
they
attacked
him
he
usually
found
means
to
make
them
march
in
double
quick
time.
The
hymn
followed
him
faintly
as
he
crossed
the
fields.
He
hastened
his
customary
sharp
pace,
that
he
might
get
beyond
its
reach.
"Thy
word
commands
our
flesh
to
dust,
'Return,
ye
sons
of
men;'
All
nations
rose
from
earth
at
first,
And
turn
to
earth
again.
"A
thousand
ages
in
Thy
sight
Are
like
an
evening
gone
Short
as
the
watch
that
ends
the
night
Before
the
rising
sun.
"Time,
like
an
ever
rolling
stream,
Bears
all
its
sons
away;
They
fly,
forgotten,
as
a
dream
Dies
at
the
opening
day.
"Like
flowery
fields,
the
nations
stand,
Fresh
in
the
morning
light;
The
flowers
beneath
the
mower's
hand
Lie
withering
ere
'tis
night.
"Our
God,
our
help
in
ages
past,
Our
hope
for
years
to
come,
Be
Thou
our
guard
while
troubles
last
O
Father,
be
our
home!"
"Now
sing
a
song
a
Scottish
song,"
suggested
Caroline,
when
the
hymn
was
over
"'Ye
banks
and
braes
o'
bonnie
Doon.'"
Again
Mrs.
Pryor
obeyed,
or
essayed
to
obey.
At
the
close
of
the
first
stanza
she
stopped.
She
could
get
no
further.
Her
full
heart
flowed
over.
"You
are
weeping
at
the
pathos
of
the
air.
Come
here,
and
I
will
comfort
you,"
said
Caroline,
in
a
pitying
accent.
Mrs.
Pryor
came.
She
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
her
patient's
bed,
and
allowed
the
wasted
arms
to
encircle
her.
"You
often
soothe
me;
let
me
soothe
you,"
murmured
the
young
girl,
kissing
her
cheek.
"I
hope,"
she
added,
"it
is
not
for
me
you
weep?"
No
answer
followed.
"Do
you
think
I
shall
not
get
better?
I
do
not
feel
very
ill
only
weak."
"But
your
mind,
Caroline
your
mind
is
crushed.
Your
heart
is
almost
broken;
you
have
been
so
neglected,
so
repulsed,
left
so
desolate."
"I
believe
grief
is,
and
always
has
been,
my
worst
ailment.
I
sometimes
think
if
an
abundant
gush
of
happiness
came
on
me
I
could
revive
yet."
"Do
you
wish
to
live?"
"I
have
no
object
in
life."
"You
love
me,
Caroline?"
"Very
much
very
truly
inexpressibly
sometimes.
Just
now
I
feel
as
if
I
could
almost
grow
to
your
heart."
"I
will
return
directly,
dear,"
remarked
Mrs.
Pryor,
as
she
laid
Caroline
down.
Quitting
her,
she
glided
to
the
door,
softly
turned
the
key
in
the
lock,
ascertained
that
it
was
fast,
and
came
back.
She
bent
over
her.
She
threw
back
the
curtain
to
admit
the
moonlight
more
freely.
She
gazed
intently
on
her
face.
"Then,
if
you
love
me,"
said
she,
speaking
quickly,
with
an
altered
voice;
"if
you
feel
as
if,
to
use
your
own
words,
you
could
'grow
to
my
heart,'
it
will
be
neither
shock
nor
pain
for
you
to
know
that
that
heart
is
the
source
whence
yours
was
filled;
that
from
my
veins
issued
the
tide
which
flows
in
yours;
that
you
are
mine
my
daughter
my
own
child."
"Mrs.
Pryor
"
"My
own
child!"
"That
is
that
means
you
have
adopted
me?"
"It
means
that,
if
I
have
given
you
nothing
else,
I
at
least
gave
you
life;
that
I
bore
you,
nursed
you;
that
I
am
your
true
mother.
No
other
woman
can
claim
the
title;
it
is
mine."
"But
Mrs.
James
Helstone
but
my
father's
wife,
whom
I
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
seen,
she
is
my
mother?"
"She
is
your
mother.
James
Helstone
was
my
husband.
I
say
you
are
mine.
I
have
proved
it.
I
thought
perhaps
you
were
all
his,
which
would
have
been
a
cruel
dispensation
for
me.
I
find
it
is
not
so.
God
permitted
me
to
be
the
parent
of
my
child's
mind.
It
belongs
to
me;
it
is
my
property
my
right.
These
features
are
James's
own.
He
had
a
fine
face
when
he
was
young,
and
not
altered
by
error.
Papa,
my
darling,
gave
you
your
blue
eyes
and
soft
brown
hair;
he
gave
you
the
oval
of
your
face
and
the
regularity
of
your
lineaments
the
outside
he
conferred;
but
the
heart
and
the
brain
are
mine.
The
germs
are
from
me,
and
they
are
improved,
they
are
