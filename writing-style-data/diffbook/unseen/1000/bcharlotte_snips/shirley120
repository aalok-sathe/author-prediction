all
night;
the
effect
of
the
terrible
drama
which
had
just
been
enacted
before
her
eyes
was
not
likely
to
quit
her
for
days.
It
was
vain
even
to
try
to
retain
a
recumbent
posture;
she
sat
up
by
Shirley's
side,
counting
the
slow
minutes,
and
watching
the
June
sun
mount
the
heavens.
Life
wastes
fast
in
such
vigils
as
Caroline
had
of
late
but
too
often
kept
vigils
during
which
the
mind,
having
no
pleasant
food
to
nourish
it,
no
manna
of
hope,
no
hived
honey
of
joyous
memories,
tries
to
live
on
the
meagre
diet
of
wishes,
and
failing
to
derive
thence
either
delight
or
support,
and
feeling
itself
ready
to
perish
with
craving
want,
turns
to
philosophy,
to
resolution,
to
resignation;
calls
on
all
these
gods
for
aid,
calls
vainly
is
unheard,
unhelped,
and
languishes.
Caroline
was
a
Christian;
therefore
in
trouble
she
framed
many
a
prayer
after
the
Christian
creed,
preferred
it
with
deep
earnestness,
begged
for
patience,
strength,
relief.
This
world,
however,
we
all
know,
is
the
scene
of
trial
and
probation;
and,
for
any
favourable
result
her
petitions
had
yet
wrought,
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
were
unheard
and
unaccepted.
She
believed,
sometimes,
that
God
had
turned
His
face
from
her.
At
moments
she
was
a
Calvinist,
and,
sinking
into
the
gulf
of
religious
despair,
she
saw
darkening
over
her
the
doom
of
reprobation.
Most
people
have
had
a
period
or
periods
in
their
lives
when
they
have
felt
thus
forsaken
when,
having
long
hoped
against
hope,
and
still
seen
the
day
of
fruition
deferred,
their
hearts
have
truly
sickened
within
them.
This
is
a
terrible
hour,
but
it
is
often
that
darkest
point
which
precedes
the
rise
of
day
that
turn
of
the
year
when
the
icy
January
wind
carries
over
the
waste
at
once
the
dirge
of
departing
winter
and
the
prophecy
of
coming
spring.
The
perishing
birds,
however,
cannot
thus
understand
the
blast
before
which
they
shiver;
and
as
little
can
the
suffering
soul
recognize,
in
the
climax
of
its
affliction,
the
dawn
of
its
deliverance.
Yet,
let
whoever
grieves
still
cling
fast
to
love
and
faith
in
God.
God
will
never
deceive,
never
finally
desert
him.
"Whom
He
loveth,
He
chasteneth."
These
words
are
true,
and
should
not
be
forgotten.
The
household
was
astir
at
last;
the
servants
were
up;
the
shutters
were
opened
below.
Caroline,
as
she
quitted
the
couch,
which
had
been
but
a
thorny
one
to
her,
felt
that
revival
of
spirits
which
the
return
of
day,
of
action,
gives
to
all
but
the
wholly
despairing
or
actually
dying.
She
dressed
herself,
as
usual,
carefully,
trying
so
to
arrange
her
hair
and
attire
that
nothing
of
the
forlornness
she
felt
at
heart
should
be
visible
externally.
She
looked
as
fresh
as
Shirley
when
both
were
dressed,
only
that
Miss
Keeldar's
eyes
were
lively,
and
Miss
Helstone's
languid.
"To
day
I
shall
have
much
to
say
to
Moore,"
were
Shirley's
first
words;
and
you
could
see
in
her
face
that
life
was
full
of
interest,
expectation,
and
occupation
for
her.
"He
will
have
to
undergo
cross
examination,"
she
added.
"I
dare
say
he
thinks
he
has
outwitted
me
cleverly.
And
this
is
the
way
men
deal
with
women
still
concealing
danger
from
them
thinking,
I
suppose,
to
spare
them
pain.
They
imagined
we
little
knew
where
they
were
to
night.
We
know
they
little
conjectured
where
we
were.
Men,
I
believe,
fancy
women's
minds
something
like
those
of
children.
Now,
that
is
a
mistake."
This
was
said
as
she
stood
at
the
glass,
training
her
naturally
waved
hair
into
curls,
by
twining
it
round
her
fingers.
She
took
up
the
theme
again
five
minutes
after,
as
Caroline
fastened
her
dress
and
clasped
her
girdle.
"If
men
could
see
us
as
we
really
are,
they
would
be
a
little
amazed;
but
the
cleverest,
the
acutest
men
are
often
under
an
illusion
about
women.
They
do
not
read
them
in
a
true
light;
they
misapprehend
them,
both
for
good
and
evil.
Their
good
woman
is
a
queer
thing,
half
doll,
half
angel;
their
bad
woman
almost
always
a
fiend.
Then
to
hear
them
fall
into
ecstasies
with
each
other's
creations
worshipping
the
heroine
of
such
a
poem,
novel,
drama
thinking
it
fine,
divine!
Fine
and
divine
it
may
be,
but
often
quite
artificial
false
as
the
rose
in
my
best
bonnet
there.
If
I
spoke
all
I
think
on
this
point,
if
I
gave
my
real
opinion
of
some
first
rate
female
characters
in
first
rate
works,
where
should
I
be?
Dead
under
a
cairn
of
avenging
stones
in
half
an
hour."
"Shirley,
you
chatter
so,
I
can't
fasten
you.
Be
still.
And,
after
all,
authors'
heroines
are
almost
as
good
as
authoresses'
heroes."
"Not
at
all.
Women
read
men
more
truly
than
men
read
women.
I'll
prove
that
in
a
magazine
paper
some
day
when
I've
time;
only
it
will
never
be
inserted.
It
will
be
'declined
with
thanks,'
and
left
for
me
at
the
publisher's."
"To
be
sure.
You
could
not
write
cleverly
enough.
You
don't
know
enough.
You
are
not
learned,
Shirley."
"God
knows
I
can't
contradict
you,
Cary;
I'm
as
ignorant
as
a
stone.
There's
one
comfort,
however:
you
are
not
much
better."
They
descended
to
breakfast.
"I
wonder
how
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Hortense
Moore
have
passed
the
night,"
said
Caroline,
as
she
made
the
coffee.
"Selfish
being
that
I
am,
I
never
thought
of
either
of
them
till
just
now.
They
will
have
heard
all
the
tumult,
Fieldhead
and
the
cottage
are
so
near;
and
Hortense
is
timid
in
such
matters
so,
no
doubt,
is
Mrs.
Pryor."
"Take
my
word
for
it,
Lina,
Moore
will
have
contrived
to
get
his
sister
out
of
the
way.
She
went
home
with
Miss
Mann.
He
will
have
quartered
her
there
for
the
night.
As
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
I
own
I
am
uneasy
about
her;
but
in
another
half
hour
we
will
be
with
her."
By
this
time
