me
words
one
night;
it
poured
a
strain
which
I
could
have
written
down,
only
I
was
appalled,
and
dared
not
rise
to
seek
pencil
and
paper
by
the
dim
watch
light.
"What
is
that
electricity
they
speak
of,
whose
changes
make
us
well
or
ill,
whose
lack
or
excess
blasts,
whose
even
balance
revives?
What
are
all
those
influences
that
are
about
us
in
the
atmosphere,
that
keep
playing
over
our
nerves
like
fingers
on
stringed
instruments,
and
call
forth
now
a
sweet
note,
and
now
a
wail
now
an
exultant
swell,
and
anon
the
saddest
cadence?
"Where
is
the
other
world?
In
what
will
another
life
consist?
Why
do
I
ask?
Have
I
not
cause
to
think
that
the
hour
is
hasting
but
too
fast
when
the
veil
must
be
rent
for
me?
Do
I
not
know
the
Grand
Mystery
is
likely
to
burst
prematurely
on
me?
Great
Spirit,
in
whose
goodness
I
confide,
whom,
as
my
Father,
I
have
petitioned
night
and
morning
from
early
infancy,
help
the
weak
creation
of
Thy
hands!
Sustain
me
through
the
ordeal
I
dread
and
must
undergo!
Give
me
strength!
Give
me
patience!
Give
me
oh,
give
me
FAITH!"
She
fell
back
on
her
pillow.
Mrs.
Pryor
found
means
to
steal
quietly
from
the
room.
She
re
entered
it
soon
after,
apparently
as
composed
as
if
she
had
really
not
overheard
this
strange
soliloquy.
The
next
day
several
callers
came.
It
had
become
known
that
Miss
Helstone
was
worse.
Mr.
Hall
and
his
sister
Margaret
arrived.
Both,
after
they
had
been
in
the
sickroom,
quitted
it
in
tears;
they
had
found
the
patient
more
altered
than
they
expected.
Hortense
Moore
came.
Caroline
seemed
stimulated
by
her
presence.
She
assured
her,
smiling,
she
was
not
dangerously
ill;
she
talked
to
her
in
a
low
voice,
but
cheerfully.
During
her
stay,
excitement
kept
up
the
flush
of
her
complexion;
she
looked
better.
"How
is
Mr.
Robert?"
asked
Mrs.
Pryor,
as
Hortense
was
preparing
to
take
leave.
"He
was
very
well
when
he
left."
"Left!
Is
he
gone
from
home?"
It
was
then
explained
that
some
police
intelligence
about
the
rioters
of
whom
he
was
in
pursuit
had,
that
morning,
called
him
away
to
Birmingham,
and
probably
a
fortnight
might
elapse
ere
he
returned.
"He
is
not
aware
that
Miss
Helstone
is
very
ill?"
"Oh
no!
He
thought,
like
me,
that
she
had
only
a
bad
cold."
After
this
visit,
Mrs.
Pryor
took
care
not
to
approach
Caroline's
couch
for
above
an
hour.
She
heard
her
weep,
and
dared
not
look
on
her
tears.
As
evening
closed
in,
she
brought
her
some
tea.
Caroline,
opening
her
eyes
from
a
moment's
slumber,
viewed
her
nurse
with
an
unrecognizing
glance.
"I
smelt
the
honeysuckles
in
the
glen
this
summer
morning,"
she
said,
"as
I
stood
at
the
counting
house
window."
Strange
words
like
these
from
pallid
lips
pierce
a
loving
listener's
heart
more
poignantly
than
steel.
They
sound
romantic,
perhaps,
in
books;
in
real
life
they
are
harrowing.
"My
darling,
do
you
know
me?"
said
Mrs.
Pryor.
"I
went
in
to
call
Robert
to
breakfast.
I
have
been
with
him
in
the
garden.
He
asked
me
to
go.
A
heavy
dew
has
refreshed
the
flowers.
The
peaches
are
ripening."
"My
darling!
my
darling!"
again
and
again
repeated
the
nurse.
"I
thought
it
was
daylight
long
after
sunrise.
It
looks
dark.
Is
the
moon
now
set?"
That
moon,
lately
risen,
was
gazing
full
and
mild
upon
her.
Floating
in
deep
blue
space,
it
watched
her
unclouded.
"Then
it
is
not
morning?
I
am
not
at
the
cottage?
Who
is
this?
I
see
a
shape
at
my
bedside."
"It
is
myself
it
is
your
friend
your
nurse
your
Lean
your
head
on
my
shoulder.
Collect
yourself."
In
a
lower
tone
"O
God,
take
pity!
Give
her
life,
and
me
strength!
Send
me
courage!
Teach
me
words!"
Some
minutes
passed
in
silence.
The
patient
lay
mute
and
passive
in
the
trembling
arms,
on
the
throbbing
bosom
of
the
nurse.
"I
am
better
now,"
whispered
Caroline
at
last,
"much
better.
I
feel
where
I
am.
This
is
Mrs.
Pryor
near
me.
I
was
dreaming.
I
talk
when
I
wake
up
from
dreams;
people
often
do
in
illness.
How
fast
your
heart
beats,
ma'am!
Do
not
be
afraid."
"It
is
not
fear,
child
only
a
little
anxiety,
which
will
pass.
I
have
brought
you
some
tea,
Cary.
Your
uncle
made
it
himself.
You
know
he
says
he
can
make
a
better
cup
of
tea
than
any
housewife
can.
Taste
it.
He
is
concerned
to
hear
that
you
eat
so
little;
he
would
be
glad
if
you
had
a
better
appetite."
"I
am
thirsty.
Let
me
drink."
She
drank
eagerly.
"What
o'clock
is
it,
ma'am?"
she
asked.
"Past
nine."
"Not
later?
Oh!
I
have
yet
a
long
night
before
me.
But
the
tea
has
made
me
strong.
I
will
sit
up."
Mrs.
Pryor
raised
her,
and
arranged
her
pillows.
"Thank
Heaven!
I
am
not
always
equally
miserable,
and
ill,
and
hopeless.
The
afternoon
has
been
bad
since
Hortense
went;
perhaps
the
evening
may
be
better.
It
is
a
fine
night,
I
think?
The
moon
shines
clear."
"Very
fine
a
perfect
summer
night.
The
old
church
tower
gleams
white
almost
as
silver."
"And
does
the
churchyard
look
peaceful?"
"Yes,
and
the
garden
also.
Dew
glistens
on
the
foliage."
"Can
you
see
many
long
weeds
and
nettles
amongst
the
graves?
or
do
they
look
turfy
and
flowery?"
"I
see
closed
daisy
heads
gleaming
like
pearls
on
some
mounds.
Thomas
has
mown
down
the
dock
leaves
and
rank
grass,
and
cleared
all
away."
"I
always
like
that
to
be
done;
it
soothes
one's
mind
to
see
the
place
in
order.
And,
I
dare
say,
within
the
church
just
now
that
moonlight
shines
as
softly
as
in
my
room.
It
will
fall
through
the
east
window
full
on
the
Helstone
monument.
When
I
close
my
eyes
I
seem
to
see
poor
papa's
epitaph
in
black
letters
