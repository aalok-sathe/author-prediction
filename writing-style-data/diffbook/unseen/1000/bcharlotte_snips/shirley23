she
has
more
intimate
opportunities
of
knowing
me.
She
sees
that
I
have
education,
intelligence,
manner,
principles
all,
in
short,
which
belongs
to
a
person
well
born
and
well
bred."
"Are
you
at
all
fond
of
her?"
"For
fond
I
cannot
say.
I
am
not
one
who
is
prone
to
take
violent
fancies,
and,
consequently,
my
friendship
is
the
more
to
be
depended
on.
I
have
a
regard
for
her
as
my
relative;
her
position
also
inspires
interest,
and
her
conduct
as
my
pupil
has
hitherto
been
such
as
rather
to
enhance
than
diminish
the
attachment
that
springs
from
other
causes."
"She
behaves
pretty
well
at
lessons?"
"To
me
she
behaves
very
well;
but
you
are
conscious,
brother,
that
I
have
a
manner
calculated
to
repel
over
familiarity,
to
win
esteem,
and
to
command
respect.
Yet,
possessed
of
penetration,
I
perceive
clearly
that
Caroline
is
not
perfect,
that
there
is
much
to
be
desired
in
her."
"Give
me
a
last
cup
of
coffee,
and
while
I
am
drinking
it
amuse
me
with
an
account
of
her
faults."
"Dear
brother,
I
am
happy
to
see
you
eat
your
breakfast
with
relish,
after
the
fatiguing
night
you
have
passed.
Caroline,
then,
is
defective;
but
with
my
forming
hand
and
almost
motherly
care
she
may
improve.
There
is
about
her
an
occasional
something
a
reserve,
I
think
which
I
do
not
quite
like,
because
it
is
not
sufficiently
girlish
and
submissive;
and
there
are
glimpses
of
an
unsettled
hurry
in
her
nature,
which
put
me
out.
Yet
she
is
usually
most
tranquil,
too
dejected
and
thoughtful
indeed
sometimes.
In
time,
I
doubt
not,
I
shall
make
her
uniformly
sedate
and
decorous,
without
being
unaccountably
pensive.
I
ever
disapprove
what
is
not
intelligible."
"I
don't
understand
your
account
in
the
least.
What
do
you
mean
by
'unsettled
hurries,'
for
instance?"
"An
example
will,
perhaps,
be
the
most
satisfactory
explanation.
I
sometimes,
you
are
aware,
make
her
read
French
poetry
by
way
of
practice
in
pronunciation.
She
has
in
the
course
of
her
lessons
gone
through
much
of
Corneille
and
Racine,
in
a
very
steady,
sober
spirit,
such
as
I
approve.
Occasionally
she
showed,
indeed,
a
degree
of
languor
in
the
perusal
of
those
esteemed
authors,
partaking
rather
of
apathy
than
sobriety;
and
apathy
is
what
I
cannot
tolerate
in
those
who
have
the
benefit
of
my
instructions
besides,
one
should
not
be
apathetic
in
studying
standard
works.
The
other
day
I
put
into
her
hands
a
volume
of
short
fugitive
pieces.
I
sent
her
to
the
window
to
learn
one
by
heart,
and
when
I
looked
up
I
saw
her
turning
the
leaves
over
impatiently,
and
curling
her
lip,
absolutely
with
scorn,
as
she
surveyed
the
little
poems
cursorily.
I
chid
her.
'Ma
cousine,'
said
she,
'tout
cela
m'ennuie
a
la
mort.'
I
told
her
this
was
improper
language.
'Dieu!'
she
exclaimed,
'il
n'y
a
donc
pas
deux
lignes
de
poesie
dans
toute
la
litterature
francaise?'
I
inquired
what
she
meant.
She
begged
my
pardon
with
proper
submission.
Ere
long
she
was
still.
I
saw
her
smiling
to
herself
over
the
book.
She
began
to
learn
assiduously.
In
half
an
hour
she
came
and
stood
before
me,
presented
the
volume,
folded
her
hands,
as
I
always
require
her
to
do,
and
commenced
the
repetition
of
that
short
thing
by
Chenier,
'La
Jeune
Captive.'
If
you
had
heard
the
manner
in
which
she
went
through
this,
and
in
which
she
uttered
a
few
incoherent
comments
when
she
had
done,
you
would
have
known
what
I
meant
by
the
phrase
'unsettled
hurry.'
One
would
have
thought
Chenier
was
more
moving
than
all
Racine
and
all
Corneille.
You,
brother,
who
have
so
much
sagacity,
will
discern
that
this
disproportionate
preference
argues
an
ill
regulated
mind;
but
she
is
fortunate
in
her
preceptress.
I
will
give
her
a
system,
a
method
of
thought,
a
set
of
opinions;
I
will
give
her
the
perfect
control
and
guidance
of
her
feelings."
"Be
sure
you
do,
Hortense.
Here
she
comes.
That
was
her
shadow
passed
the
window,
I
believe."
"Ah!
truly.
She
is
too
early
half
an
hour
before
her
time.
My
child,
what
brings
you
here
before
I
have
breakfasted?"
This
question
was
addressed
to
an
individual
who
now
entered
the
room,
a
young
girl,
wrapped
in
a
winter
mantle,
the
folds
of
which
were
gathered
with
some
grace
round
an
apparently
slender
figure.
"I
came
in
haste
to
see
how
you
were,
Hortense,
and
how
Robert
was
too.
I
was
sure
you
would
be
both
grieved
by
what
happened
last
night.
I
did
not
hear
till
this
morning.
My
uncle
told
me
at
breakfast."
"Ah!
it
is
unspeakable.
You
sympathize
with
us?
Your
uncle
sympathizes
with
us?"
"My
uncle
is
very
angry
but
he
was
with
Robert,
I
believe,
was
he
not?
Did
he
not
go
with
you
to
Stilbro'
Moor?"
"Yes,
we
set
out
in
very
martial
style,
Caroline;
but
the
prisoners
we
went
to
rescue
met
us
half
way."
"Of
course
nobody
was
hurt?"
"Why,
no;
only
Joe
Scott's
wrists
were
a
little
galled
with
being
pinioned
too
tightly
behind
his
back."
"You
were
not
there?
You
were
not
with
the
wagons
when
they
were
attacked?"
"No.
One
seldom
has
the
fortune
to
be
present
at
occurrences
at
which
one
would
particularly
wish
to
assist."
"Where
are
you
going
this
morning?
I
saw
Murgatroyd
saddling
your
horse
in
the
yard."
"To
Whinbury.
It
is
market
day."
"Mr.
Yorke
is
going
too.
I
met
him
in
his
gig.
Come
home
with
him."
"Why?"
"Two
are
better
than
one,
and
nobody
dislikes
Mr.
Yorke
at
least,
poor
people
do
not
dislike
him."
"Therefore
he
would
be
a
protection
to
me,
who
am
hated?"
"Who
are
misunderstood.
That,
probably,
is
the
word.
Shall
you
be
late?
Will
he
be
late,
Cousin
Hortense?"
"It
is
too
probable.
He
has
often
much
business
to
transact
at
Whinbury.
Have
you
brought
your
exercise
book,
child?"
"Yes.
What
time
will
you
return,
Robert?"
"I
