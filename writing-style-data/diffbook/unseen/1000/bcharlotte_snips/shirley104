defiled.
It
was
very
narrow
so
narrow
that
only
two
could
walk
abreast
without
falling
into
the
ditch
which
ran
along
each
side.
They
had
gained
the
middle
of
it,
when
excitement
became
obvious
in
the
clerical
commanders.
Boultby's
spectacles
and
Helstone's
Rehoboam
were
agitated;
the
curates
nudged
each
other;
Mr.
Hall
turned
to
the
ladies
and
smiled.
"What
is
the
matter?"
was
the
demand.
He
pointed
with
his
staff
to
the
end
of
the
lane
before
them.
Lo
and
behold!
another,
an
opposition,
procession
was
there
entering,
headed
also
by
men
in
black,
and
followed
also,
as
they
could
now
hear,
by
music.
"Is
it
our
double?"
asked
Shirley,
"our
manifold
wraith?
Here
is
a
card
turned
up."
"If
you
wanted
a
battle,
you
are
likely
to
get
one
at
least
of
looks,"
whispered
Caroline,
laughing.
"They
shall
not
pass
us!"
cried
the
curates
unanimously;
"we'll
not
give
way!"
"Give
way!"
retorted
Helstone
sternly,
turning
round;
"who
talks
of
giving
way?
You,
boys,
mind
what
you
are
about.
The
ladies,
I
know,
will
be
firm.
I
can
trust
them.
There
is
not
a
churchwoman
here
but
will
stand
her
ground
against
these
folks,
for
the
honour
of
the
Establishment.
What
does
Miss
Keeldar
say?"
"She
asks
what
is
it."
"The
Dissenting
and
Methodist
schools,
the
Baptists,
Independents,
and
Wesleyans,
joined
in
unholy
alliance,
and
turning
purposely
into
this
lane
with
the
intention
of
obstructing
our
march
and
driving
us
back."
"Bad
manners!"
said
Shirley,
"and
I
hate
bad
manners.
Of
course,
they
must
have
a
lesson."
"A
lesson
in
politeness,"
suggested
Mr.
Hall,
who
was
ever
for
peace;
"not
an
example
of
rudeness."
Old
Helstone
moved
on.
Quickening
his
step,
he
marched
some
yards
in
advance
of
his
company.
He
had
nearly
reached
the
other
sable
leaders,
when
he
who
appeared
to
act
as
the
hostile
commander
in
chief
a
large,
greasy
man,
with
black
hair
combed
flat
on
his
forehead
called
a
halt.
The
procession
paused.
He
drew
forth
a
hymn
book,
gave
out
a
verse,
set
a
tune,
and
they
all
struck
up
the
most
dolorous
of
canticles.
Helstone
signed
to
his
bands.
They
clashed
out
with
all
the
power
of
brass.
He
desired
them
to
play
"Rule,
Britannia!"
and
ordered
the
children
to
join
in
vocally,
which
they
did
with
enthusiastic
spirit.
The
enemy
was
sung
and
stormed
down,
his
psalm
quelled.
As
far
as
noise
went,
he
was
conquered.
"Now,
follow
me!"
exclaimed
Helstone;
"not
at
a
run,
but
at
a
firm,
smart
pace.
Be
steady,
every
child
and
woman
of
you.
Keep
together.
Hold
on
by
each
other's
skirts,
if
necessary."
And
he
strode
on
with
such
a
determined
and
deliberate
gait,
and
was,
besides,
so
well
seconded
by
his
scholars
and
teachers,
who
did
exactly
as
he
told
them,
neither
running
nor
faltering,
but
marching
with
cool,
solid
impetus
the
curates,
too,
being
compelled
to
do
the
same,
as
they
were
between
two
fires,
Helstone
and
Miss
Keeldar,
both
of
whom
watched
any
deviation
with
lynx
eyed
vigilance,
and
were
ready,
the
one
with
his
cane,
the
other
with
her
parasol,
to
rebuke
the
slightest
breach
of
orders,
the
least
independent
or
irregular
demonstration
that
the
body
of
Dissenters
were
first
amazed,
then
alarmed,
then
borne
down
and
pressed
back,
and
at
last
forced
to
turn
tail
and
leave
the
outlet
from
Royd
Lane
free.
Boultby
suffered
in
the
onslaught,
but
Helstone
and
Malone,
between
them,
held
him
up,
and
brought
him
through
the
business,
whole
in
limb,
though
sorely
tried
in
wind.
The
fat
Dissenter
who
had
given
out
the
hymn
was
left
sitting
in
the
ditch.
He
was
a
spirit
merchant
by
trade,
a
leader
of
the
Nonconformists,
and,
it
was
said,
drank
more
water
in
that
one
afternoon
than
he
had
swallowed
for
a
twelvemonth
before.
Mr.
Hall
had
taken
care
of
Caroline,
and
Caroline
of
him.
He
and
Miss
Ainley
made
their
own
quiet
comments
to
each
other
afterwards
on
the
incident.
Miss
Keeldar
and
Mr.
Helstone
shook
hands
heartily
when
they
had
fairly
got
the
whole
party
through
the
lane.
The
curates
began
to
exult,
but
Mr.
Helstone
presently
put
the
curb
on
their
innocent
spirits.
He
remarked
that
they
never
had
sense
to
know
what
to
say,
and
had
better
hold
their
tongues;
and
he
reminded
them
that
the
business
was
none
of
their
managing.
About
half
past
three
the
procession
turned
back,
and
at
four
once
more
regained
the
starting
place.
Long
lines
of
benches
were
arranged
in
the
close
shorn
fields
round
the
school.
There
the
children
were
seated,
and
huge
baskets,
covered
up
with
white
cloths,
and
great
smoking
tin
vessels
were
brought
out.
Ere
the
distribution
of
good
things
commenced,
a
brief
grace
was
pronounced
by
Mr.
Hall
and
sung
by
the
children.
Their
young
voices
sounded
melodious,
even
touching,
in
the
open
air.
Large
currant
buns
and
hot,
well
sweetened
tea
were
then
administered
in
the
proper
spirit
of
liberality.
No
stinting
was
permitted
on
this
day,
at
least;
the
rule
for
each
child's
allowance
being
that
it
was
to
have
about
twice
as
much
as
it
could
possibly
eat,
thus
leaving
a
reserve
to
be
carried
home
for
such
as
age,
sickness,
or
other
impediment
prevented
from
coming
to
the
feast.
Buns
and
beer
circulated,
meantime,
amongst
the
musicians
and
church
singers;
afterwards
the
benches
were
removed,
and
they
were
left
to
unbend
their
spirits
in
licensed
play.
A
bell
summoned
the
teachers,
patrons,
and
patronesses
to
the
schoolroom.
Miss
Keeldar,
Miss
Helstone,
and
many
other
ladies
were
already
there,
glancing
over
the
arrangement
of
their
separate
trays
and
tables.
Most
of
the
female
servants
of
the
neighbourhood,
together
with
the
clerks',
the
singers',
and
the
musicians'
wives,
had
been
pressed
into
the
service
of
the
day
as
waiters.
Each
vied
with
the
other
in
smartness
and
daintiness
of
dress,
and
many
handsome
forms
were
seen
amongst
the
younger
ones.
About
half
a
score
were
cutting
bread
and
butter,
another
half
