fifty
you
will
not
be
repulsive."
"Miss
Mann
did
not
make
herself,
or
tune
her
voice,
Robert."
"Nature
made
her
in
the
mood
in
which
she
makes
her
briars
and
thorns;
whereas
for
the
creation
of
some
women
she
reserves
the
May
morning
hours,
when
with
light
and
dew
she
wooes
the
primrose
from
the
turf
and
the
lily
from
the
wood
moss."
Ushered
into
Miss
Mann's
little
parlour,
Caroline
found
her,
as
she
always
found
her,
surrounded
by
perfect
neatness,
cleanliness,
and
comfort
(after
all,
is
it
not
a
virtue
in
old
maids
that
solitude
rarely
makes
them
negligent
or
disorderly?)
no
dust
on
her
polished
furniture,
none
on
her
carpet,
fresh
flowers
in
the
vase
on
her
table,
a
bright
fire
in
the
grate.
She
herself
sat
primly
and
somewhat
grimly
tidy
in
a
cushioned
rocking
chair,
her
hands
busied
with
some
knitting.
This
was
her
favourite
work,
as
it
required
the
least
exertion.
She
scarcely
rose
as
Caroline
entered.
To
avoid
excitement
was
one
of
Miss
Mann's
aims
in
life.
She
had
been
composing
herself
ever
since
she
came
down
in
the
morning,
and
had
just
attained
a
certain
lethargic
state
of
tranquillity
when
the
visitor's
knock
at
the
door
startled
her,
and
undid
her
day's
work.
She
was
scarcely
pleased,
therefore,
to
see
Miss
Helstone.
She
received
her
with
reserve,
bade
her
be
seated
with
austerity,
and
when
she
got
her
placed
opposite,
she
fixed
her
with
her
eye.
This
was
no
ordinary
doom
to
be
fixed
with
Miss
Mann's
eye.
Robert
Moore
had
undergone
it
once,
and
had
never
forgotten
the
circumstance.
He
considered
it
quite
equal
to
anything
Medusa
could
do.
He
professed
to
doubt
whether,
since
that
infliction,
his
flesh
had
been
quite
what
it
was
before
whether
there
was
not
something
stony
in
its
texture.
The
gaze
had
had
such
an
effect
on
him
as
to
drive
him
promptly
from
the
apartment
and
house;
it
had
even
sent
him
straightway
up
to
the
rectory,
where
he
had
appeared
in
Caroline's
presence
with
a
very
queer
face,
and
amazed
her
by
demanding
a
cousinly
salute
on
the
spot,
to
rectify
a
damage
that
had
been
done
him.
Certainly
Miss
Mann
had
a
formidable
eye
for
one
of
the
softer
sex.
It
was
prominent,
and
showed
a
great
deal
of
the
white,
and
looked
as
steadily,
as
unwinkingly,
at
you
as
if
it
were
a
steel
ball
soldered
in
her
head;
and
when,
while
looking,
she
began
to
talk
in
an
indescribably
dry,
monotonous
tone
a
tone
without
vibration
or
inflection
you
felt
as
if
a
graven
image
of
some
bad
spirit
were
addressing
you.
But
it
was
all
a
figment
of
fancy,
a
matter
of
surface.
Miss
Mann's
goblin
grimness
scarcely
went
deeper
than
the
angel
sweetness
of
hundreds
of
beauties.
She
was
a
perfectly
honest,
conscientious
woman,
who
had
performed
duties
in
her
day
from
whose
severe
anguish
many
a
human
Peri,
gazelle
eyed,
silken
tressed,
and
silver
tongued,
would
have
shrunk
appalled.
She
had
passed
alone
through
protracted
scenes
of
suffering,
exercised
rigid
self
denial,
made
large
sacrifices
of
time,
money,
health
for
those
who
had
repaid
her
only
by
ingratitude,
and
now
her
main
almost
her
sole
fault
was
that
she
was
censorious.
Censorious
she
certainly
was.
Caroline
had
not
sat
five
minutes
ere
her
hostess,
still
keeping
her
under
the
spell
of
that
dread
and
Gorgon
gaze,
began
flaying
alive
certain
of
the
families
in
the
neighbourhood.
She
went
to
work
at
this
business
in
a
singularly
cool,
deliberate
manner,
like
some
surgeon
practising
with
his
scalpel
on
a
lifeless
subject.
She
made
few
distinctions;
she
allowed
scarcely
any
one
to
be
good;
she
dissected
impartially
almost
all
her
acquaintance.
If
her
auditress
ventured
now
and
then
to
put
in
a
palliative
word
she
set
it
aside
with
a
certain
disdain.
Still,
though
thus
pitiless
in
moral
anatomy,
she
was
no
scandal
monger.
She
never
disseminated
really
malignant
or
dangerous
reports.
It
was
not
her
heart
so
much
as
her
temper
that
was
wrong.
Caroline
made
this
discovery
for
the
first
time
to
day,
and
moved
thereby
to
regret
divers
unjust
judgments
she
had
more
than
once
passed
on
the
crabbed
old
maid,
she
began
to
talk
to
her
softly,
not
in
sympathizing
words,
but
with
a
sympathizing
voice.
The
loneliness
of
her
condition
struck
her
visitor
in
a
new
light,
as
did
also
the
character
of
her
ugliness
a
bloodless
pallor
of
complexion,
and
deeply
worn
lines
of
feature.
The
girl
pitied
the
solitary
and
afflicted
woman;
her
looks
told
what
she
felt.
A
sweet
countenance
is
never
so
sweet
as
when
the
moved
heart
animates
it
with
compassionate
tenderness.
Miss
Mann,
seeing
such
a
countenance
raised
to
her,
was
touched
in
her
turn.
She
acknowledged
her
sense
of
the
interest
thus
unexpectedly
shown
in
her,
who
usually
met
with
only
coldness
and
ridicule,
by
replying
to
her
candidly.
Communicative
on
her
own
affairs
she
usually
was
not,
because
no
one
cared
to
listen
to
her;
but
to
day
she
became
so,
and
her
confidante
shed
tears
as
she
heard
her
speak,
for
she
told
of
cruel,
slow
wasting,
obstinate
sufferings.
Well
might
she
be
corpse
like;
well
might
she
look
grim,
and
never
smile;
well
might
she
wish
to
avoid
excitement,
to
gain
and
retain
composure!
Caroline,
when
she
knew
all,
acknowledged
that
Miss
Mann
was
rather
to
be
admired
for
fortitude
than
blamed
for
moroseness.
Reader!
when
you
behold
an
aspect
for
whose
constant
gloom
and
frown
you
cannot
account,
whose
unvarying
cloud
exasperates
you
by
its
apparent
causelessness,
be
sure
that
there
is
a
canker
somewhere,
and
a
canker
not
the
less
deeply
corroding
because
concealed.
Miss
Mann
felt
that
she
was
understood
partly,
and
wished
to
be
understood
further;
for,
however
old,
plain,
humble,
desolate,
afflicted
we
may
be,
so
long
as
our
hearts
preserve
the
feeblest
spark
of
life,
they
preserve
also,
shivering
near
that
pale
ember,
a
starved,
ghostly
longing
for
appreciation
