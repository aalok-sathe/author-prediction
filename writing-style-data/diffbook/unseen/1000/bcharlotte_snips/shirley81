returning
from
market,
I
encountered
him
and
Moses
Barraclough,
both
in
an
advanced
stage
of
inebriation.
They
were
praying
in
frantic
sort
at
the
roadside.
They
accosted
me
as
Satan,
bid
me
avaunt,
and
clamoured
to
be
delivered
from
temptation.
Again,
but
a
few
days
ago,
Michael
took
the
trouble
of
appearing
at
the
counting
house
door,
hatless,
in
his
shirt
sleeves
his
coat
and
castor
having
been
detained
at
the
public
house
in
pledge.
He
delivered
himself
of
the
comfortable
message
that
he
could
wish
Mr.
Moore
to
set
his
house
in
order,
as
his
soul
was
likely
shortly
to
be
required
of
him."
"Do
you
make
light
of
these
things?"
"The
poor
man
had
been
drinking
for
weeks,
and
was
in
a
state
bordering
on
delirium
tremens."
"What
then?
He
is
the
more
likely
to
attempt
the
fulfilment
of
his
own
prophecies."
"It
would
not
do
to
permit
incidents
of
this
sort
to
affect
one's
nerves."
"Mr.
Moore,
go
home!"
"So
soon?"
"Pass
straight
down
the
fields,
not
round
by
the
lade
and
plantations."
"It
is
early
yet."
"It
is
late.
For
my
part,
I
am
going
in.
Will
you
promise
me
not
to
wander
in
the
Hollow
to
night?"
"If
you
wish
it."
"I
do
wish
it.
May
I
ask
whether
you
consider
life
valueless?"
"By
no
means.
On
the
contrary,
of
late
I
regard
my
life
as
invaluable."
"Of
late?"
"Existence
is
neither
aimless
nor
hopeless
to
me
now,
and
it
was
both
three
months
ago.
I
was
then
drowning,
and
rather
wished
the
operation
over.
All
at
once
a
hand
was
stretched
to
me
such
a
delicate
hand
I
scarcely
dared
trust
it;
its
strength,
however,
has
rescued
me
from
ruin."
"Are
you
really
rescued?"
"For
the
time.
Your
assistance
has
given
me
another
chance."
"Live
to
make
the
best
of
it.
Don't
offer
yourself
as
a
target
to
Michael
Hartley;
and
good
night!"
Miss
Helstone
was
under
a
promise
to
spend
the
evening
of
the
next
day
at
Fieldhead.
She
kept
her
promise.
Some
gloomy
hours
had
she
spent
in
the
interval.
Most
of
the
time
had
been
passed
shut
up
in
her
own
apartment,
only
issuing
from
it,
indeed,
to
join
her
uncle
at
meals,
and
anticipating
inquiries
from
Fanny
by
telling
her
that
she
was
busy
altering
a
dress,
and
preferred
sewing
upstairs,
to
avoid
interruption.
She
did
sew.
She
plied
her
needle
continuously,
ceaselessly,
but
her
brain
worked
faster
than
her
fingers.
Again,
and
more
intensely
than
ever,
she
desired
a
fixed
occupation,
no
matter
how
onerous,
how
irksome.
Her
uncle
must
be
once
more
entreated,
but
first
she
would
consult
Mrs.
Pryor.
Her
head
laboured
to
frame
projects
as
diligently
as
her
hands
to
plait
and
stitch
the
thin
texture
of
the
muslin
summer
dress
spread
on
the
little
white
couch
at
the
foot
of
which
she
sat.
Now
and
then,
while
thus
doubly
occupied,
a
tear
would
fill
her
eyes
and
fall
on
her
busy
hands;
but
this
sign
of
emotion
was
rare
and
quickly
effaced.
The
sharp
pang
passed;
the
dimness
cleared
from
her
vision.
She
would
re
thread
her
needle,
rearrange
tuck
and
trimming,
and
work
on.
Late
in
the
afternoon
she
dressed
herself.
She
reached
Fieldhead,
and
appeared
in
the
oak
parlour
just
as
tea
was
brought
in.
Shirley
asked
her
why
she
came
so
late.
"Because
I
have
been
making
my
dress,"
said
she.
"These
fine
sunny
days
began
to
make
me
ashamed
of
my
winter
merino,
so
I
have
furbished
up
a
lighter
garment."
"In
which
you
look
as
I
like
to
see
you,"
said
Shirley.
"You
are
a
lady
like
little
person,
Caroline.
Is
she
not,
Mrs.
Pryor?"
Mrs.
Pryor
never
paid
compliments,
and
seldom
indulged
in
remarks,
favourable
or
otherwise,
on
personal
appearance.
On
the
present
occasion
she
only
swept
Caroline's
curls
from
her
cheek
as
she
took
a
seat
near
her,
caressed
the
oval
outline,
and
observed,
"You
get
somewhat
thin,
my
love,
and
somewhat
pale.
Do
you
sleep
well?
your
eyes
have
a
languid
look."
And
she
gazed
at
her
anxiously.
"I
sometimes
dream
melancholy
dreams,"
answered
Caroline;
"and
if
I
lie
awake
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
night,
I
am
continually
thinking
of
the
rectory
as
a
dreary
old
place.
You
know
it
is
very
near
the
churchyard.
The
back
part
of
the
house
is
extremely
ancient,
and
it
is
said
that
the
out
kitchens
there
were
once
enclosed
in
the
churchyard,
and
that
there
are
graves
under
them.
I
rather
long
to
leave
the
rectory."
"My
dear,
you
are
surely
not
superstitious?"
"No,
Mrs.
Pryor;
but
I
think
I
grow
what
is
called
nervous.
I
see
things
under
a
darker
aspect
than
I
used
to
do.
I
have
fears
I
never
used
to
have
not
of
ghosts,
but
of
omens
and
disastrous
events;
and
I
have
an
inexpressible
weight
on
my
mind
which
I
would
give
the
world
to
shake
off,
and
I
cannot
do
it."
"Strange!"
cried
Shirley.
"I
never
feel
so."
Mrs.
Pryor
said
nothing.
"Fine
weather,
pleasant
days,
pleasant
scenes,
are
powerless
to
give
me
pleasure,"
continued
Caroline.
"Calm
evenings
are
not
calm
to
me.
Moonlight,
which
I
used
to
think
mild,
now
only
looks
mournful.
Is
this
weakness
of
mind,
Mrs.
Pryor,
or
what
is
it?
I
cannot
help
it.
I
often
struggle
against
it.
I
reason;
but
reason
and
effort
make
no
difference."
"You
should
take
more
exercise,"
said
Mrs.
Pryor.
"Exercise!
I
exercise
sufficiently.
I
exercise
till
I
am
ready
to
drop."
"My
dear,
you
should
go
from
home."
"Mrs.
Pryor,
I
should
like
to
go
from
home,
but
not
on
any
purposeless
excursion
or
visit.
I
wish
to
be
a
governess,
as
you
have
been.
It
would
oblige
me
greatly
if
you
would
speak
to
my
uncle
on
the
subject."
"Nonsense!"
broke
in
Shirley.
"What
an
idea!
Be
a
governess!
Better
be
a
slave
at
once.
Where
is
the
necessity
of
it?
Why
should
you
dream
of
such
a
