and
livelier
than
usual.
"Beautiful
morning,
Moore.
How
do,
my
boy?
Ha!
whom
have
we
here?"
(turning
to
the
personage
with
the
staff).
"Sugden!
What!
you're
going
to
work
directly?
On
my
word,
you
lose
no
time.
But
I
come
to
ask
explanations.
Your
message
was
delivered
to
me.
Are
you
sure
you
are
on
the
right
scent?
How
do
you
mean
to
set
about
the
business?
Have
you
got
a
warrant?"
"Sugden
has."
"Then
you
are
going
to
seek
him
now?
I'll
accompany
you."
"You
will
be
spared
that
trouble,
sir;
he
is
coming
to
seek
me.
I'm
just
now
sitting
in
state
waiting
his
arrival."
"And
who
is
it?
One
of
my
parishioners?"
Joe
Scott
had
entered
unobserved.
He
now
stood,
a
most
sinister
phantom,
half
his
person
being
dyed
of
the
deepest
tint
of
indigo,
leaning
on
the
desk.
His
master's
answer
to
the
rector's
question
was
a
smile.
Joe
took
the
word.
Putting
on
a
quiet
but
pawky
look,
he
said,
"It's
a
friend
of
yours,
Mr.
Helstone,
a
gentleman
you
often
speak
of."
"Indeed!
His
name,
Joe?
You
look
well
this
morning."
"Only
the
Rev.
Moses
Barraclough;
t'
tub
orator
you
call
him
sometimes,
I
think."
"Ah!"
said
the
rector,
taking
out
his
snuff
box,
and
administering
to
himself
a
very
long
pinch
"ah!
couldn't
have
supposed
it.
Why,
the
pious
man
never
was
a
workman
of
yours,
Moore.
He's
a
tailor
by
trade."
"And
so
much
the
worse
grudge
I
owe
him,
for
interfering
and
setting
my
discarded
men
against
me."
"And
Moses
was
actually
present
at
the
battle
of
Stilbro'
Moor?
He
went
there,
wooden
leg
and
all?"
"Ay,
sir,"
said
Joe;
"he
went
there
on
horseback,
that
his
leg
mightn't
be
noticed.
He
was
the
captain,
and
wore
a
mask.
The
rest
only
had
their
faces
blackened."
"And
how
was
he
found
out?"
"I'll
tell
you,
sir,"
said
Joe.
"T'
maister's
not
so
fond
of
talking.
I've
no
objections.
He
courted
Sarah,
Mr.
Moore's
sarvant
lass,
and
so
it
seems
she
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
him;
she
either
didn't
like
his
wooden
leg
or
she'd
some
notion
about
his
being
a
hypocrite.
Happen
(for
women
is
queer
hands;
we
may
say
that
amang
werseln
when
there's
none
of
'em
nigh)
she'd
have
encouraged
him,
in
spite
of
his
leg
and
his
deceit,
just
to
pass
time
like.
I've
known
some
on
'em
do
as
mich,
and
some
o'
t'
bonniest
and
mimmest
looking,
too
ay,
I've
seen
clean,
trim
young
things,
that
looked
as
denty
and
pure
as
daisies,
and
wi'
time
a
body
fun'
'em
out
to
be
nowt
but
stinging,
venomed
nettles."
"Joe's
a
sensible
fellow,"
interjected
Helstone.
"Howsiver,
Sarah
had
another
string
to
her
bow.
Fred
Murgatroyd,
one
of
our
lads,
is
for
her;
and
as
women
judge
men
by
their
faces
and
Fred
has
a
middling
face,
while
Moses
is
none
so
handsome,
as
we
all
knaw
the
lass
took
on
wi'
Fred.
A
two
three
months
sin',
Murgatroyd
and
Moses
chanced
to
meet
one
Sunday
night;
they'd
both
come
lurking
about
these
premises
wi'
the
notion
of
counselling
Sarah
to
tak
a
bit
of
a
walk
wi'
them.
They
fell
out,
had
a
tussle,
and
Fred
was
worsted,
for
he's
young
and
small,
and
Barraclough,
for
all
he
has
only
one
leg,
is
almost
as
strong
as
Sugden
there
indeed,
anybody
that
hears
him
roaring
at
a
revival
or
a
love
feast
may
be
sure
he's
no
weakling."
"Joe,
you're
insupportable,"
here
broke
in
Mr.
Moore.
"You
spin
out
your
explanation
as
Moses
spins
out
his
sermons.
The
long
and
short
of
it
is,
Murgatroyd
was
jealous
of
Barraclough;
and
last
night,
as
he
and
a
friend
took
shelter
in
a
barn
from
a
shower,
they
heard
and
saw
Moses
conferring
with
some
associates
within.
From
their
discourse
it
was
plain
he
had
been
the
leader,
not
only
at
Stilbro'
Moor,
but
in
the
attack
on
Sykes's
property.
Moreover
they
planned
a
deputation
to
wait
on
me
this
morning,
which
the
tailor
is
to
head,
and
which,
in
the
most
religious
and
peaceful
spirit,
is
to
entreat
me
to
put
the
accursed
thing
out
of
my
tent.
I
rode
over
to
Whinbury
this
morning,
got
a
constable
and
a
warrant,
and
I
am
now
waiting
to
give
my
friend
the
reception
he
deserves.
Here,
meantime,
comes
Sykes.
Mr.
Helstone,
you
must
spirit
him
up.
He
feels
timid
at
the
thoughts
of
prosecuting."
A
gig
was
heard
to
roll
into
the
yard.
Mr.
Sykes
entered
a
tall
stout
man
of
about
fifty,
comely
of
feature,
but
feeble
of
physiognomy.
He
looked
anxious.
"Have
they
been?
Are
they
gone?
Have
you
got
him?
Is
it
over?"
he
asked.
"Not
yet,"
returned
Moore
with
phlegm.
"We
are
waiting
for
them."
"They'll
not
come;
it's
near
noon.
Better
give
it
up.
It
will
excite
bad
feeling
make
a
stir
cause
perhaps
fatal
consequences."
"You
need
not
appear,"
said
Moore.
"I
shall
meet
them
in
the
yard
when
they
come;
you
can
stay
here."
"But
my
name
must
be
seen
in
the
law
proceedings.
A
wife
and
family,
Mr.
Moore
a
wife
and
family
make
a
man
cautious."
Moore
looked
disgusted.
"Give
way,
if
you
please,"
said
he;
"leave
me
to
myself.
I
have
no
objection
to
act
alone;
only
be
assured
you
will
not
find
safety
in
submission.
Your
partner
Pearson
gave
way,
and
conceded,
and
forbore.
Well,
that
did
not
prevent
them
from
attempting
to
shoot
him
in
his
own
house."
"My
dear
sir,
take
a
little
wine
and
water,"
recommended
Mr.
Helstone.
The
wine
and
water
was
hollands
and
water,
as
Mr.
Sykes
discovered
when
he
had
compounded
and
swallowed
a
brimming
tumbler
thereof.
It
transfigured
him
in
two
minutes,
brought
the
colour
back
to
his
face,
and
made
him
at
least
word
valiant.
He
now
announced
that
he
hoped
he
was
above
being
trampled
on
by
the
common
people;
he
was
determined
to
endure
the
insolence
