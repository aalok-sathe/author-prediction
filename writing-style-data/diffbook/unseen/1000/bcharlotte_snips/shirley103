real
or
imaginary,
from
his
brow.
Boultby,
in
short,
was
in
his
glory,
and
in
a
round,
sound
voix
de
poitrine
he
rumbled
out
thanks
for
attentions
and
assurances
of
his
tolerable
health.
Of
Caroline
he
took
no
manner
of
notice
as
she
came
near,
save
to
accept
what
she
offered.
He
did
not
see
her
he
never
did
see
her;
he
hardly
knew
that
such
a
person
existed.
He
saw
the
macaroons,
however,
and
being
fond
of
sweets,
possessed
himself
of
a
small
handful
thereof.
The
wine
Mrs.
Boultby
insisted
on
mingling
with
hot
water,
and
qualifying
with
sugar
and
nutmeg.
Mr.
Hall
stood
near
an
open
window,
breathing
the
fresh
air
and
scent
of
flowers,
and
talking
like
a
brother
to
Miss
Ainley.
To
him
Caroline
turned
her
attention
with
pleasure.
"What
should
she
bring
him?
He
must
not
help
himself
he
must
be
served
by
her."
And
she
provided
herself
with
a
little
salver,
that
she
might
offer
him
variety.
Margaret
Hall
joined
them;
so
did
Miss
Keeldar.
The
four
ladies
stood
round
their
favourite
pastor.
They
also
had
an
idea
that
they
looked
on
the
face
of
an
earthly
angel.
Cyril
Hall
was
their
pope,
infallible
to
them
as
Dr.
Thomas
Boultby
to
his
admirers.
A
throng,
too,
enclosed
the
rector
of
Briarfield
twenty
or
more
pressed
round
him;
and
no
parson
was
ever
more
potent
in
a
circle
than
old
Helstone.
The
curates,
herding
together
after
their
manner,
made
a
constellation
of
three
lesser
planets.
Divers
young
ladies
watched
them
afar
off,
but
ventured
not
nigh.
Mr.
Helstone
produced
his
watch.
"Ten
minutes
to
two,"
he
announced
aloud.
"Time
for
all
to
fall
into
line.
Come."
He
seized
his
shovel
hat
and
marched
away.
All
rose
and
followed
en
masse.
The
twelve
hundred
children
were
drawn
up
in
three
bodies
of
four
hundred
souls
each;
in
the
rear
of
each
regiment
was
stationed
a
band;
between
every
twenty
there
was
an
interval,
wherein
Helstone
posted
the
teachers
in
pairs.
To
the
van
of
the
armies
he
summoned,
"Grace
Boultby
and
Mary
Sykes
lead
out
Whinbury.
"Margaret
Hall
and
Mary
Ann
Ainley
conduct
Nunnely.
"Caroline
Helstone
and
Shirley
Keeldar
head
Briarfield."
Then
again
he
gave
command,
"Mr.
Donne
to
Whinbury;
Mr.
Sweeting
to
Nunnely;
Mr.
Malone
to
Briarfield."
And
these
gentlemen
stepped
up
before
the
lady
generals.
The
rectors
passed
to
the
full
front;
the
parish
clerks
fell
to
the
extreme
rear.
Helstone
lifted
his
shovel
hat.
In
an
instant
out
clashed
the
eight
bells
in
the
tower,
loud
swelled
the
sounding
bands,
flute
spoke
and
clarion
answered,
deep
rolled
the
drums,
and
away
they
marched.
The
broad
white
road
unrolled
before
the
long
procession,
the
sun
and
sky
surveyed
it
cloudless,
the
wind
tossed
the
tree
boughs
above
it,
and
the
twelve
hundred
children
and
one
hundred
and
forty
adults
of
which
it
was
composed
trod
on
in
time
and
tune,
with
gay
faces
and
glad
hearts.
It
was
a
joyous
scene,
and
a
scene
to
do
good.
It
was
a
day
of
happiness
for
rich
and
poor
the
work,
first
of
God,
and
then
of
the
clergy.
Let
England's
priests
have
their
due.
They
are
a
faulty
set
in
some
respects,
being
only
of
common
flesh
and
blood
like
us
all;
but
the
land
would
be
badly
off
without
them.
Britain
would
miss
her
church,
if
that
church
fell.
God
save
it!
God
also
reform
it!
Not
on
combat
bent,
nor
of
foemen
in
search,
was
this
priest
led
and
woman
officered
company;
yet
their
music
played
martial
tunes,
and,
to
judge
by
the
eyes
and
carriage
of
some
Miss
Keeldar,
for
instance
these
sounds
awoke,
if
not
a
martial,
yet
a
longing
spirit.
Old
Helstone,
turning
by
chance,
looked
into
her
face;
and
he
laughed,
and
she
laughed
at
him.
"There
is
no
battle
in
prospect,"
he
said;
"our
country
does
not
want
us
to
fight
for
it.
No
foe
or
tyrant
is
questioning
or
threatening
our
liberty.
There
is
nothing
to
be
done.
We
are
only
taking
a
walk.
Keep
your
hand
on
the
reins,
captain,
and
slack
the
fire
of
that
spirit.
It
is
not
wanted,
the
more's
the
pity."
"Take
your
own
advice,
doctor,"
was
Shirley's
response.
To
Caroline
she
murmured,
"I'll
borrow
of
imagination
what
reality
will
not
give
me.
We
are
not
soldiers
bloodshed
is
not
my
desire
or
if
we
are,
we
are
soldiers
of
the
Cross.
Time
has
rolled
back
some
hundreds
of
years,
and
we
are
bound
on
a
pilgrimage
to
Palestine.
But
no;
that
is
too
visionary.
I
need
a
sterner
dream.
We
are
Lowlanders
of
Scotland,
following
a
Covenanting
captain
up
into
the
hills
to
hold
a
meeting
out
of
the
reach
of
persecuting
troopers.
We
know
that
battle
may
follow
prayer;
and
as
we
believe
that
in
the
worst
issue
of
battle
heaven
must
be
our
reward,
we
are
ready
and
willing
to
redden
the
peat
moss
with
our
blood.
That
music
stirs
my
soul;
it
wakens
all
my
life;
it
makes
my
heart
beat
not
with
its
temperate
daily
pulse,
but
with
a
new,
thrilling
vigour.
I
almost
long
for
danger
for
a
faith,
a
land,
or
at
least
a
lover
to
defend."
"Look,
Shirley!"
interrupted
Caroline.
"What
is
that
red
speck
above
Stilbro'
Brow?
You
have
keener
sight
than
I.
Just
turn
your
eagle
eye
to
it."
Miss
Keeldar
looked.
"I
see,"
she
said;
then
added
presently,
"there
is
a
line
of
red.
They
are
soldiers
cavalry
soldiers,"
she
subjoined
quickly.
"They
ride
fast.
There
are
six
of
them.
They
will
pass
us.
No;
they
have
turned
off
to
the
right.
They
saw
our
procession,
and
avoid
it
by
making
a
circuit.
Where
are
they
going?"
"Perhaps
they
are
only
exercising
their
horses."
"Perhaps
so.
We
see
them
no
more
now."
Mr.
Helstone
here
spoke.
"We
shall
pass
through
Royd
Lane,
to
reach
Nunnely
Common
by
a
short
cut,"
said
he.
And
into
the
straits
of
Royd
Lane
they
accordingly
