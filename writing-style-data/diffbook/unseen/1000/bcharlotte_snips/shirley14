set
with
lights
in
their
pitchers,
like
the
army
of
Gideon;
and
as
we've
th'
parson
wi',
us
good
evening,
Mr.
Helstone
we'se
do."
Mr.
Helstone
returned
the
salutation
of
the
individual
in
the
gig
very
stiffly
indeed.
That
individual
proceeded,
"We're
eleven
strong
men,
and
there's
both
horses
and
chariots
amang
us.
If
we
could
only
fall
in
wi'
some
of
these
starved
ragamuffins
of
frame
breakers
we
could
win
a
grand
victory.
We
could
iv'ry
one
be
a
Wellington
that
would
please
ye,
Mr.
Helstone
and
sich
paragraphs
as
we
could
contrive
for
t'
papers!
Briarfield
suld
be
famous.
But
we'se
hev
a
column
and
a
half
i'
th'
Stilbro'
Courier
ower
this
job,
as
it
is,
I
dare
say.
I'se
expect
no
less."
"And
I'll
promise
you
no
less,
Mr.
Yorke,
for
I'll
write
the
article
myself,"
returned
the
rector.
"To
be
sure
sartainly!
And
mind
ye
recommend
weel
that
them
'at
brake
t'
bits
o'
frames,
and
teed
Joe
Scott's
legs
wi'
band,
suld
be
hung
without
benefit
o'
clergy.
It's
a
hanging
matter,
or
suld
be.
No
doubt
o'
that."
"If
I
judged
them
I'd
give
them
short
shrift!"
cried
Moore.
"But
I
mean
to
let
them
quite
alone
this
bout,
to
give
them
rope
enough,
certain
that
in
the
end
they
will
hang
themselves."
"Let
them
alone,
will
ye,
Moore?
Do
you
promise
that?"
"Promise!
No.
All
I
mean
to
say
is,
I
shall
give
myself
no
particular
trouble
to
catch
them;
but
if
one
falls
in
my
way
"
"You'll
snap
him
up,
of
course.
Only
you
would
rather
they
would
do
something
worse
than
merely
stop
a
wagon
before
you
reckon
with
them.
Well,
we'll
say
no
more
on
the
subject
at
present.
Here
we
are
at
my
door,
gentlemen,
and
I
hope
you
and
the
men
will
step
in.
You
will
none
of
you
be
the
worse
of
a
little
refreshment."
Moore
and
Helstone
opposed
this
proposition
as
unnecessary.
It
was,
however,
pressed
on
them
so
courteously,
and
the
night,
besides,
was
so
inclement,
and
the
gleam
from
the
muslin
curtained
windows
of
the
house
before
which
they
had
halted
looked
so
inviting,
that
at
length
they
yielded.
Mr.
Yorke,
after
having
alighted
from
his
gig,
which
he
left
in
charge
of
a
man
who
issued
from
an
outbuilding
on
his
arrival,
led
the
way
in.
It
will
have
been
remarked
that
Mr.
Yorke
varied
a
little
in
his
phraseology.
Now
he
spoke
broad
Yorkshire,
and
anon
he
expressed
himself
in
very
pure
English.
His
manner
seemed
liable
to
equal
alternations.
He
could
be
polite
and
affable,
and
he
could
be
blunt
and
rough.
His
station
then
you
could
not
easily
determine
by
his
speech
and
demeanour.
Perhaps
the
appearance
of
his
residence
may
decide
it.
The
men
he
recommended
to
take
the
kitchen
way,
saying
that
he
would
"see
them
served
wi'
summat
to
taste
presently."
The
gentlemen
were
ushered
in
at
the
front
entrance.
They
found
themselves
in
a
matted
hall,
lined
almost
to
the
ceiling
with
pictures.
Through
this
they
were
conducted
to
a
large
parlour,
with
a
magnificent
fire
in
the
grate
the
most
cheerful
of
rooms
it
appeared
as
a
whole,
and
when
you
came
to
examine
details,
the
enlivening
effect
was
not
diminished.
There
was
no
splendour,
but
there
was
taste
everywhere,
unusual
taste
the
taste,
you
would
have
said,
of
a
travelled
man,
a
scholar,
and
a
gentleman.
A
series
of
Italian
views
decked
the
walls.
Each
of
these
was
a
specimen
of
true
art.
A
connoisseur
had
selected
them;
they
were
genuine
and
valuable.
Even
by
candle
light
the
bright
clear
skies,
the
soft
distances,
with
blue
air
quivering
between
the
eye
and
the
hills,
the
fresh
tints,
and
well
massed
lights
and
shadows,
charmed
the
view.
The
subjects
were
all
pastoral,
the
scenes
were
all
sunny.
There
was
a
guitar
and
some
music
on
a
sofa;
there
were
cameos,
beautiful
miniatures;
a
set
of
Grecian
looking
vases
on
the
mantelpiece;
there
were
books
well
arranged
in
two
elegant
bookcases.
Mr.
Yorke
bade
his
guests
be
seated.
He
then
rang
for
wine.
To
the
servant
who
brought
it
he
gave
hospitable
orders
for
the
refreshment
of
the
men
in
the
kitchen.
The
rector
remained
standing;
he
seemed
not
to
like
his
quarters;
he
would
not
touch
the
wine
his
host
offered
him.
"E'en
as
you
will,"
remarked
Mr.
Yorke.
"I
reckon
you're
thinking
of
Eastern
customs,
Mr.
Helstone,
and
you'll
not
eat
nor
drink
under
my
roof,
feared
we
suld
be
forced
to
be
friends;
but
I
am
not
so
particular
or
superstitious.
You
might
sup
the
contents
of
that
decanter,
and
you
might
give
me
a
bottle
of
the
best
in
your
own
cellar,
and
I'd
hold
myself
free
to
oppose
you
at
every
turn
still
in
every
vestry
meeting
and
justice
meeting
where
we
encountered
one
another."
"It
is
just
what
I
should
expect
of
you,
Mr.
Yorke."
"Does
it
agree
wi'
ye
now,
Mr.
Helstone,
to
be
riding
out
after
rioters,
of
a
wet
night,
at
your
age?"
"It
always
agrees
with
me
to
be
doing
my
duty;
and
in
this
case
my
duty
is
a
thorough
pleasure.
To
hunt
down
vermin
is
a
noble
occupation,
fit
for
an
archbishop."
"Fit
for
ye,
at
ony
rate.
But
where's
t'
curate?
He's
happen
gone
to
visit
some
poor
body
in
a
sick
gird,
or
he's
happen
hunting
down
vermin
in
another
direction."
"He
is
doing
garrison
duty
at
Hollow's
Mill."
"You
left
him
a
sup
o'
wine,
I
hope,
Bob"
(turning
to
Mr.
Moore),
"to
keep
his
courage
up?"
He
did
not
pause
for
an
answer,
but
continued,
quickly,
still
addressing
Moore,
who
had
thrown
himself
into
an
old
fashioned
chair
by
the
fireside
"Move
it,
Robert!
Get
up,
my
lad!
That
place
is
mine.
Take
the
sofa,
or
three
other
chairs,
if
you
will,
but
not
this.
It
belangs
to
me,
and
nob'dy
else."
"Why
are
you
so
particular
to
