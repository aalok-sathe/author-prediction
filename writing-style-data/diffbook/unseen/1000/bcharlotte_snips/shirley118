operative
class.
It
is
difficult
to
be
tolerant,
difficult
to
be
just,
in
such
moments.
Caroline
rose;
Shirley
put
her
arm
round
her:
they
stood
together
as
still
as
the
straight
stems
of
two
trees.
That
yell
was
a
long
one,
and
when
it
ceased
the
night
was
yet
full
of
the
swaying
and
murmuring
of
a
crowd.
"What
next?"
was
the
question
of
the
listeners.
Nothing
came
yet.
The
mill
remained
mute
as
a
mausoleum.
"He
cannot
be
alone!"
whispered
Caroline.
"I
would
stake
all
I
have
that
he
is
as
little
alone
as
he
is
alarmed,"
responded
Shirley.
Shots
were
discharged
by
the
rioters.
Had
the
defenders
waited
for
this
signal?
It
seemed
so.
The
hitherto
inert
and
passive
mill
woke;
fire
flashed
from
its
empty
window
frames;
a
volley
of
musketry
pealed
sharp
through
the
Hollow.
"Moore
speaks
at
last!"
said
Shirley,
"and
he
seems
to
have
the
gift
of
tongues.
That
was
not
a
single
voice."
"He
has
been
forbearing.
No
one
can
accuse
him
of
rashness,"
alleged
Caroline.
"Their
discharge
preceded
his.
They
broke
his
gates
and
his
windows.
They
fired
at
his
garrison
before
he
repelled
them."
What
was
going
on
now?
It
seemed
difficult,
in
the
darkness,
to
distinguish;
but
something
terrible,
a
still
renewing
tumult,
was
obvious
fierce
attacks,
desperate
repulses.
The
mill
yard,
the
mill
itself,
was
full
of
battle
movement.
There
was
scarcely
any
cessation
now
of
the
discharge
of
firearms;
and
there
was
struggling,
rushing,
trampling,
and
shouting
between.
The
aim
of
the
assailants
seemed
to
be
to
enter
the
mill,
that
of
the
defenders
to
beat
them
off.
They
heard
the
rebel
leader
cry,
"To
the
back,
lads!"
They
heard
a
voice
retort,
"Come
round;
we
will
meet
you."
"To
the
counting
house!"
was
the
order
again.
"Welcome!
we
shall
have
you
there!"
was
the
response.
And
accordingly
the
fiercest
blaze
that
had
yet
glowed,
the
loudest
rattle
that
had
yet
been
heard,
burst
from
the
counting
house
front
when
the
mass
of
rioters
rushed
up
to
it.
The
voice
that
had
spoken
was
Moore's
own
voice.
They
could
tell
by
its
tones
that
his
soul
was
now
warm
with
the
conflict;
they
could
guess
that
the
fighting
animal
was
roused
in
every
one
of
those
men
there
struggling
together,
and
was
for
the
time
quite
paramount
above
the
rational
human
being.
Both
the
girls
felt
their
faces
glow
and
their
pulses
throb;
both
knew
they
would
do
no
good
by
rushing
down
into
the
melee.
They
desired
neither
to
deal
nor
to
receive
blows;
but
they
could
not
have
run
away
Caroline
no
more
than
Shirley;
they
could
not
have
fainted;
they
could
not
have
taken
their
eyes
from
the
dim,
terrible
scene
from
the
mass
of
cloud,
of
smoke,
the
musket
lightning
for
the
world.
"How
and
when
would
it
end?"
was
the
demand
throbbing
in
their
throbbing
pulses.
"Would
a
juncture
arise
in
which
they
could
be
useful?"
was
what
they
waited
to
see;
for
though
Shirley
put
off
their
too
late
arrival
with
a
jest,
and
was
ever
ready
to
satirize
her
own
or
any
other
person's
enthusiasm,
she
would
have
given
a
farm
of
her
best
land
for
a
chance
of
rendering
good
service.
The
chance
was
not
vouchsafed
her;
the
looked
for
juncture
never
came.
It
was
not
likely.
Moore
had
expected
this
attack
for
days,
perhaps
weeks;
he
was
prepared
for
it
at
every
point.
He
had
fortified
and
garrisoned
his
mill,
which
in
itself
was
a
strong
building.
He
was
a
cool,
brave
man;
he
stood
to
the
defence
with
unflinching
firmness.
Those
who
were
with
him
caught
his
spirit,
and
copied
his
demeanour.
The
rioters
had
never
been
so
met
before.
At
other
mills
they
had
attacked
they
had
found
no
resistance;
an
organized,
resolute
defence
was
what
they
never
dreamed
of
encountering.
When
their
leaders
saw
the
steady
fire
kept
up
from
the
mill,
witnessed
the
composure
and
determination
of
its
owner,
heard
themselves
coolly
defied
and
invited
on
to
death,
and
beheld
their
men
falling
wounded
round
them,
they
felt
that
nothing
was
to
be
done
here.
In
haste
they
mustered
their
forces,
drew
them
away
from
the
building.
A
roll
was
called
over,
in
which
the
men
answered
to
figures
instead
of
names.
They
dispersed
wide
over
the
fields,
leaving
silence
and
ruin
behind
them.
The
attack,
from
its
commencement
to
its
termination,
had
not
occupied
an
hour.
Day
was
by
this
time
approaching;
the
west
was
dim,
the
east
beginning
to
gleam.
It
would
have
seemed
that
the
girls
who
had
watched
this
conflict
would
now
wish
to
hasten
to
the
victors,
on
whose
side
all
their
interest
had
been
enlisted;
but
they
only
very
cautiously
approached
the
now
battered
mill,
and
when
suddenly
a
number
of
soldiers
and
gentlemen
appeared
at
the
great
door
opening
into
the
yard,
they
quickly
stepped
aside
into
a
shed,
the
deposit
of
old
iron
and
timber,
whence
they
could
see
without
being
seen.
It
was
no
cheering
spectacle.
These
premises
were
now
a
mere
blot
of
desolation
on
the
fresh
front
of
the
summer
dawn.
All
the
copse
up
the
Hollow
was
shady
and
dewy,
the
hill
at
its
head
was
green;
but
just
here,
in
the
centre
of
the
sweet
glen,
Discord,
broken
loose
in
the
night
from
control,
had
beaten
the
ground
with
his
stamping
hoofs,
and
left
it
waste
and
pulverized.
The
mill
yawned
all
ruinous
with
unglazed
frames;
the
yard
was
thickly
bestrewn
with
stones
and
brickbats;
and
close
under
the
mill,
with
the
glittering
fragments
of
the
shattered
windows,
muskets
and
other
weapons
lay
here
and
there.
More
than
one
deep
crimson
stain
was
visible
on
the
gravel,
a
human
body
lay
quiet
on
its
face
near
the
gates,
and
five
or
six
wounded
men
writhed
and
moaned
in
the
bloody
dust.
Miss
Keeldar's
countenance
changed
at
this
view.
It
was
the
after
taste
of
the
battle,
death
and
pain
replacing
excitement
and
