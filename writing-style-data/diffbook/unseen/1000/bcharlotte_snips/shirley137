seemed
to
open
with
such
promise
such
foreboding
of
a
most
strange
tale
to
be
unfolded."
"And
in
reading
it
you
feel
as
if
you
were
far
away
from
England
really
in
Italy
under
another
sort
of
sky
that
blue
sky
of
the
south
which
travellers
describe."
"You
are
sensible
of
that,
Rose?"
"It
makes
me
long
to
travel,
Miss
Helstone."
"When
you
are
a
woman,
perhaps,
you
may
be
able
to
gratify
your
wish."
"I
mean
to
make
a
way
to
do
so,
if
one
is
not
made
for
me.
I
cannot
live
always
in
Briarfield.
The
whole
world
is
not
very
large
compared
with
creation.
I
must
see
the
outside
of
our
own
round
planet,
at
least."
"How
much
of
its
outside?"
"First
this
hemisphere
where
we
live;
then
the
other.
I
am
resolved
that
my
life
shall
be
a
life.
Not
a
black
trance
like
the
toad's,
buried
in
marble;
nor
a
long,
slow
death
like
yours
in
Briarfield
rectory."
"Like
mine!
what
can
you
mean,
child?"
"Might
you
not
as
well
be
tediously
dying
as
for
ever
shut
up
in
that
glebe
house
a
place
that,
when
I
pass
it,
always
reminds
me
of
a
windowed
grave?
I
never
see
any
movement
about
the
door.
I
never
hear
a
sound
from
the
wall.
I
believe
smoke
never
issues
from
the
chimneys.
What
do
you
do
there?"
"I
sew,
I
read,
I
learn
lessons."
"Are
you
happy?"
"Should
I
be
happy
wandering
alone
in
strange
countries
as
you
wish
to
do?"
"Much
happier,
even
if
you
did
nothing
but
wander.
Remember,
however,
that
I
shall
have
an
object
in
view;
but
if
you
only
went
on
and
on,
like
some
enchanted
lady
in
a
fairy
tale,
you
might
be
happier
than
now.
In
a
day's
wandering
you
would
pass
many
a
hill,
wood,
and
watercourse,
each
perpetually
altering
in
aspect
as
the
sun
shone
out
or
was
overcast;
as
the
weather
was
wet
or
fair,
dark
or
bright.
Nothing
changes
in
Briarfield
rectory.
The
plaster
of
the
parlour
ceilings,
the
paper
on
the
walls,
the
curtains,
carpets,
chairs,
are
still
the
same."
"Is
change
necessary
to
happiness?"
"Yes."
"Is
it
synonymous
with
it?"
"I
don't
know;
but
I
feel
monotony
and
death
to
be
almost
the
same."
Here
Jessie
spoke.
"Isn't
she
mad?"
she
asked.
"But,
Rose,"
pursued
Caroline,
"I
fear
a
wanderer's
life,
for
me
at
least,
would
end
like
that
tale
you
are
reading
in
disappointment,
vanity,
and
vexation
of
spirit."
"Does
'The
Italian'
so
end?"
"I
thought
so
when
I
read
it."
"Better
to
try
all
things
and
find
all
empty
than
to
try
nothing
and
leave
your
life
a
blank.
To
do
this
is
to
commit
the
sin
of
him
who
buried
his
talent
in
a
napkin
despicable
sluggard!"
"Rose,"
observed
Mrs.
Yorke,
"solid
satisfaction
is
only
to
be
realized
by
doing
one's
duty."
"Right,
mother!
And
if
my
Master
has
given
me
ten
talents,
my
duty
is
to
trade
with
them,
and
make
them
ten
talents
more.
Not
in
the
dust
of
household
drawers
shall
the
coin
be
interred.
I
will
not
deposit
it
in
a
broken
spouted
teapot,
and
shut
it
up
in
a
china
closet
among
tea
things.
I
will
not
commit
it
to
your
work
table
to
be
smothered
in
piles
of
woollen
hose.
I
will
not
prison
it
in
the
linen
press
to
find
shrouds
among
the
sheets.
And
least
of
all,
mother"
(she
got
up
from
the
floor)
"least
of
all
will
I
hide
it
in
a
tureen
of
cold
potatoes,
to
be
ranged
with
bread,
butter,
pastry,
and
ham
on
the
shelves
of
the
larder."
She
stopped,
then
went
on,
"Mother,
the
Lord
who
gave
each
of
us
our
talents
will
come
home
some
day,
and
will
demand
from
all
an
account.
The
teapot,
the
old
stocking
foot,
the
linen
rag,
the
willow
pattern
tureen
will
yield
up
their
barren
deposit
in
many
a
house.
Suffer
your
daughters,
at
least,
to
put
their
money
to
the
exchangers,
that
they
may
be
enabled
at
the
Master's
coming
to
pay
Him
His
own
with
usury."
"Rose,
did
you
bring
your
sampler
with
you,
as
I
told
you?"
"Yes,
mother."
"Sit
down,
and
do
a
line
of
marking."
Rose
sat
down
promptly,
and
wrought
according
to
orders.
After
a
busy
pause
of
ten
minutes,
her
mother
asked,
"Do
you
think
yourself
oppressed
now
a
victim?"
"No,
mother."
"Yet,
as
far
as
I
understood
your
tirade,
it
was
a
protest
against
all
womanly
and
domestic
employment."
"You
misunderstood
it,
mother.
I
should
be
sorry
not
to
learn
to
sew.
You
do
right
to
teach
me,
and
to
make
me
work."
"Even
to
the
mending
of
your
brothers'
stockings
and
the
making
of
sheets?"
"Yes."
"Where
is
the
use
of
ranting
and
spouting
about
it,
then?"
"Am
I
to
do
nothing
but
that?
I
will
do
that,
and
then
I
will
do
more.
Now,
mother,
I
have
said
my
say.
I
am
twelve
years
old
at
present,
and
not
till
I
am
sixteen
will
I
speak
again
about
talents.
For
four
years
I
bind
myself
an
industrious
apprentice
to
all
you
can
teach
me."
"You
see
what
my
daughters
are,
Miss
Helstone,"
observed
Mrs.
Yorke;
"how
precociously
wise
in
their
own
conceits!
'I
would
rather
this,
I
prefer
that'
such
is
Jessie's
cuckoo
song;
while
Rose
utters
the
bolder
cry,
'I
will,
and
I
will
not!'"
"I
render
a
reason,
mother;
besides,
if
my
cry
is
bold,
it
is
only
heard
once
in
a
twelvemonth.
About
each
birthday
the
spirit
moves
me
to
deliver
one
oracle
respecting
my
own
instruction
and
management.
I
utter
it
and
leave
it;
it
is
for
you,
mother,
to
listen
or
not."
"I
would
advise
all
young
ladies,"
pursued
Mrs.
Yorke,
"to
study
the
characters
of
such
children
as
they
chance
to
meet
with
before
they
marry
and
have
any
of
their
own
to
consider
well
how
they
would
like
the
responsibility
of
guiding
the
careless,
