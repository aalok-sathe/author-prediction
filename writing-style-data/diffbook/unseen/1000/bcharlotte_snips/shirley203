the
cold
reflection
from
the
snow
glimmered
in
our
chamber,
then
I
saw
Shirley's
heart."
"Her
heart's
core?
Do
you
think
she
showed
you
that?"
"Her
heart's
core."
"And
how
was
it?"
"Like
a
shrine,
for
it
was
holy;
like
snow,
for
it
was
pure;
like
flame,
for
it
was
warm;
like
death,
for
it
was
strong."
"Can
she
love?
tell
me
that."
"What
think
you?"
"She
has
loved
none
that
have
loved
her
yet."
"Who
are
those
that
have
loved
her?"
He
named
a
list
of
gentlemen,
closing
with
Sir
Philip
Nunnely.
"She
has
loved
none
of
these."
"Yet
some
of
them
were
worthy
of
a
woman's
affection."
"Of
some
women's,
but
not
of
Shirley's."
"Is
she
better
than
others
of
her
sex?"
"She
is
peculiar,
and
more
dangerous
to
take
as
a
wife
rashly."
"I
can
imagine
that."
"She
spoke
of
you
"
"Oh,
she
did!
I
thought
you
denied
it."
"She
did
not
speak
in
the
way
you
fancy;
but
I
asked
her,
and
I
would
make
her
tell
me
what
she
thought
of
you,
or
rather
how
she
felt
towards
you.
I
wanted
to
know;
I
had
long
wanted
to
know."
"So
had
I;
but
let
us
hear.
She
thinks
meanly,
she
feels
contemptuously,
doubtless?"
"She
thinks
of
you
almost
as
highly
as
a
woman
can
think
of
a
man.
You
know
she
can
be
eloquent.
I
yet
feel
in
fancy
the
glow
of
the
language
in
which
her
opinion
was
conveyed."
"But
how
does
she
feel?"
"Till
you
shocked
her
(she
said
you
had
shocked
her,
but
she
would
not
tell
me
how)
she
felt
as
a
sister
feels
towards
a
brother
of
whom
she
is
at
once
fond
and
proud."
"I'll
shock
her
no
more,
Cary,
for
the
shock
rebounded
on
myself
till
I
staggered
again.
But
that
comparison
about
sister
and
brother
is
all
nonsense.
She
is
too
rich
and
proud
to
entertain
fraternal
sentiments
for
me."
"You
don't
know
her,
Robert;
and,
somehow,
I
fancy
now
(I
had
other
ideas
formerly)
that
you
cannot
know
her.
You
and
she
are
not
so
constructed
as
to
be
able
thoroughly
to
understand
each
other."
"It
may
be
so.
I
esteem
her,
I
admire
her;
and
yet
my
impressions
concerning
her
are
harsh
perhaps
uncharitable.
I
believe,
for
instance,
that
she
is
incapable
of
love
"
"Shirley
incapable
of
love!"
"That
she
will
never
marry.
I
imagine
her
jealous
of
compromising
her
pride,
of
relinquishing
her
power,
of
sharing
her
property."
"Shirley
has
hurt
your
amour
propre."
"She
did
hurt
it;
though
I
had
not
an
emotion
of
tenderness,
nor
a
spark
of
passion
for
her."
"Then,
Robert,
it
was
very
wicked
in
you
to
want
to
marry
her."
"And
very
mean,
my
little
pastor,
my
pretty
priestess.
I
never
wanted
to
kiss
Miss
Keeldar
in
my
life,
though
she
has
fine
lips,
scarlet
and
round
as
ripe
cherries;
or,
if
I
did
wish
it,
it
was
the
mere
desire
of
the
eye."
"I
doubt,
now,
whether
you
are
speaking
the
truth.
The
grapes
or
the
cherries
are
sour
'hung
too
high.'"
"She
has
a
pretty
figure,
a
pretty
face,
beautiful
hair.
I
acknowledge
all
her
charms
and
feel
none
of
them,
or
only
feel
them
in
a
way
she
would
disdain.
I
suppose
I
was
truly
tempted
by
the
mere
gilding
of
the
bait.
Caroline,
what
a
noble
fellow
your
Robert
is
great,
good,
disinterested,
and
then
so
pure!"
"But
not
perfect.
He
made
a
great
blunder
once,
and
we
will
hear
no
more
about
it."
"And
shall
we
think
no
more
about
it,
Cary?
Shall
we
not
despise
him
in
our
heart
gentle
but
just,
compassionate
but
upright?"
"Never!
We
will
remember
that
with
what
measure
we
mete
it
shall
be
measured
unto
us,
and
so
we
will
give
no
scorn,
only
affection."
"Which
won't
satisfy,
I
warn
you
of
that.
Something
besides
affection
something
far
stronger,
sweeter,
warmer
will
be
demanded
one
day.
Is
it
there
to
give?"
Caroline
was
moved,
much
moved.
"Be
calm,
Lina,"
said
Moore
soothingly.
"I
have
no
intention,
because
I
have
no
right,
to
perturb
your
mind
now,
nor
for
months
to
come.
Don't
look
as
if
you
would
leave
me.
We
will
make
no
more
agitating
allusions;
we
will
resume
our
gossip.
Do
not
tremble;
look
me
in
the
face.
See
what
a
poor,
pale,
grim
phantom
I
am
more
pitiable
than
formidable."
She
looked
shyly.
"There
is
something
formidable
still,
pale
as
you
are,"
she
said,
as
her
eye
fell
under
his.
"To
return
to
Shirley,"
pursued
Moore:
"is
it
your
opinion
that
she
is
ever
likely
to
marry?"
"She
loves."
"Platonically
theoretically
all
humbug!"
"She
loves
what
I
call
sincerely."
"Did
she
say
so?"
"I
cannot
affirm
that
she
said
so.
No
such
confession
as
'I
love
this
man
or
that'
passed
her
lips."
"I
thought
not."
"But
the
feeling
made
its
way
in
spite
of
her,
and
I
saw
it.
She
spoke
of
one
man
in
a
strain
not
to
be
misunderstood.
Her
voice
alone
was
sufficient
testimony.
Having
wrung
from
her
an
opinion
on
your
character,
I
demanded
a
second
opinion
of
another
person
about
whom
I
had
my
conjectures,
though
they
were
the
most
tangled
and
puzzled
conjectures
in
the
world.
I
would
make
her
speak.
I
shook
her,
I
chid
her,
I
pinched
her
fingers
when
she
tried
to
put
me
off
with
gibes
and
jests
in
her
queer
provoking
way,
and
at
last
out
it
came.
The
voice,
I
say,
was
enough;
hardly
raised
above
a
whisper,
and
yet
such
a
soft
vehemence
in
its
tones.
There
was
no
confession,
no
confidence,
in
the
matter.
To
these
things
she
cannot
condescend;
but
I
am
sure
that
man's
happiness
is
dear
to
her
as
her
own
life."
"Who
is
it?"
"I
charged
her
with
the
fact.
She
did
not
deny,
she
did
not
avow,
but
looked
at
me.
I
saw
her
eyes
by
the
snow
gleam.
It
was
quite
enough.
