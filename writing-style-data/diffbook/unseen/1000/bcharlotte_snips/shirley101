fearlessly,
then,
on
daisy
and
turf,
and
through
thick
plantations;
she
reached
Fieldhead,
and
penetrated
to
Miss
Keeldar's
dressing
room.
It
was
well
she
had
come,
or
Shirley
would
have
been
too
late.
Instead
of
making
ready
with
all
speed,
she
lay
stretched
on
a
couch,
absorbed
in
reading.
Mrs.
Pryor
stood
near,
vainly
urging
her
to
rise
and
dress.
Caroline
wasted
no
words.
She
immediately
took
the
book
from
her,
and
with
her
own
hands
commenced
the
business
of
disrobing
and
rerobing
her.
Shirley,
indolent
with
the
heat,
and
gay
with
her
youth
and
pleasurable
nature,
wanted
to
talk,
laugh,
and
linger;
but
Caroline,
intent
on
being
in
time,
persevered
in
dressing
her
as
fast
as
fingers
could
fasten
strings
or
insert
pins.
At
length,
as
she
united
a
final
row
of
hooks
and
eyes,
she
found
leisure
to
chide
her,
saying
she
was
very
naughty
to
be
so
unpunctual,
that
she
looked
even
now
the
picture
of
incorrigible
carelessness;
and
so
Shirley
did,
but
a
very
lovely
picture
of
that
tiresome
quality.
She
presented
quite
a
contrast
to
Caroline.
There
was
style
in
every
fold
of
her
dress
and
every
line
of
her
figure.
The
rich
silk
suited
her
better
than
a
simpler
costume;
the
deep
embroidered
scarf
became
her.
She
wore
it
negligently
but
gracefully.
The
wreath
on
her
bonnet
crowned
her
well.
The
attention
to
fashion,
the
tasteful
appliance
of
ornament
in
each
portion
of
her
dress,
were
quite
in
place
with
her.
All
this
suited
her,
like
the
frank
light
in
her
eyes,
the
rallying
smile
about
her
lips,
like
her
shaft
straight
carriage
and
lightsome
step.
Caroline
took
her
hand
when
she
was
dressed,
hurried
her
downstairs,
out
of
doors;
and
thus
they
sped
through
the
fields,
laughing
as
they
went,
and
looking
very
much
like
a
snow
white
dove
and
gem
tinted
bird
of
paradise
joined
in
social
flight.
Thanks
to
Miss
Helstone's
promptitude,
they
arrived
in
good
time.
While
yet
trees
hid
the
church,
they
heard
the
bell
tolling
a
measured
but
urgent
summons
for
all
to
assemble.
The
trooping
in
of
numbers,
the
trampling
of
many
steps
and
murmuring
of
many
voices,
were
likewise
audible.
From
a
rising
ground,
they
presently
saw,
on
the
Whinbury
road,
the
Whinbury
school
approaching.
It
numbered
five
hundred
souls.
The
rector
and
curate,
Boultby
and
Donne,
headed
it
the
former
looming
large
in
full
canonicals,
walking
as
became
a
beneficed
priest,
under
the
canopy
of
a
shovel
hat,
with
the
dignity
of
an
ample
corporation,
the
embellishment
of
the
squarest
and
vastest
of
black
coats,
and
the
support
of
the
stoutest
of
gold
headed
canes.
As
the
doctor
walked,
he
now
and
then
slightly
flourished
his
cane,
and
inclined
his
shovel
hat
with
a
dogmatical
wag
towards
his
aide
de
camp.
That
aide
de
camp
Donne,
to
wit
narrow
as
the
line
of
his
shape
was,
compared
to
the
broad
bulk
of
his
principal,
contrived,
notwithstanding,
to
look
every
inch
a
curate.
All
about
him
was
pragmatical
and
self
complacent,
from
his
turned
up
nose
and
elevated
chin
to
his
clerical
black
gaiters,
his
somewhat
short,
strapless
trousers,
and
his
square
toed
shoes.
Walk
on,
Mr.
Donne!
You
have
undergone
scrutiny.
You
think
you
look
well.
Whether
the
white
and
purple
figures
watching
you
from
yonder
hill
think
so
is
another
question.
These
figures
come
running
down
when
the
regiment
has
marched
by.
The
churchyard
is
full
of
children
and
teachers,
all
in
their
very
best
holiday
attire;
and,
distressed
as
is
the
district,
bad
as
are
the
times,
it
is
wonderful
to
see
how
respectably,
how
handsomely
even,
they
have
contrived
to
clothe
themselves.
That
British
love
of
decency
will
work
miracles.
The
poverty
which
reduces
an
Irish
girl
to
rags
is
impotent
to
rob
the
English
girl
of
the
neat
wardrobe
she
knows
necessary
to
her
self
respect.
Besides,
the
lady
of
the
manor
that
Shirley,
now
gazing
with
pleasure
on
this
well
dressed
and
happy
looking
crowd
has
really
done
them
good.
Her
seasonable
bounty
consoled
many
a
poor
family
against
the
coming
holiday,
and
supplied
many
a
child
with
a
new
frock
or
bonnet
for
the
occasion.
She
knows
it,
and
is
elate
with
the
consciousness
glad
that
her
money,
example,
and
influence
have
really,
substantially,
benefited
those
around
her.
She
cannot
be
charitable
like
Miss
Ainley:
it
is
not
in
her
nature.
It
relieves
her
to
feel
that
there
is
another
way
of
being
charitable,
practicable
for
other
characters,
and
under
other
circumstances.
Caroline,
too,
is
pleased,
for
she
also
has
done
good
in
her
small
way
robbed
herself
of
more
than
one
dress,
ribbon,
or
collar
she
could
ill
spare,
to
aid
in
fitting
out
the
scholars
of
her
class;
and
as
she
could
not
give
money,
she
has
followed
Miss
Ainley's
example
in
giving
her
time
and
her
industry
to
sew
for
the
children.
Not
only
is
the
churchyard
full,
but
the
rectory
garden
is
also
thronged.
Pairs
and
parties
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
are
seen
walking
amongst
the
waving
lilacs
and
laburnums.
The
house
also
is
occupied:
at
the
wide
open
parlour
windows
gay
groups
are
standing.
These
are
the
patrons
and
teachers,
who
are
to
swell
the
procession.
In
the
parson's
croft,
behind
the
rectory,
are
the
musicians
of
the
three
parish
bands,
with
their
instruments.
Fanny
and
Eliza,
in
the
smartest
of
caps
and
gowns,
and
the
whitest
of
aprons,
move
amongst
them,
serving
out
quarts
of
ale,
whereof
a
stock
was
brewed
very
sound
and
strong
some
weeks
since
by
the
rector's
orders,
and
under
his
special
superintendence.
Whatever
he
had
a
hand
in
must
be
managed
handsomely.
"Shabby
doings"
of
any
description
were
not
endured
under
his
sanction.
From
the
erection
of
a
public
building,
a
church,
school,
or
court
house,
to
the
cooking
of
a
dinner,
he
still
advocated
the
lordly,
liberal,
and
effective.
Miss
Keeldar
was
like
him
in
this
respect,
and
they
mutually
approved
each
other's
arrangements.
Caroline
and
Shirley
