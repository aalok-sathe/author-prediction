into
a
parlour.
Of
course,
as
was
to
be
expected
in
such
a
Gothic
old
barrack,
this
parlour
was
lined
with
oak:
fine,
dark,
glossy
panels
compassed
the
walls
gloomily
and
grandly.
Very
handsome,
reader,
these
shining
brown
panels
are,
very
mellow
in
colouring
and
tasteful
in
effect,
but
if
you
know
what
a
"spring
clean"
is
very
execrable
and
inhuman.
Whoever,
having
the
bowels
of
humanity,
has
seen
servants
scrubbing
at
these
polished
wooden
walls
with
beeswaxed
cloths
on
a
warm
May
day
must
allow
that
they
are
"intolerable
and
not
to
be
endured;"
and
I
cannot
but
secretly
applaud
the
benevolent
barbarian
who
had
painted
another
and
larger
apartment
of
Fieldhead
the
drawing
room,
to
wit,
formerly
also
an
oak
room
of
a
delicate
pinky
white,
thereby
earning
for
himself
the
character
of
a
Hun,
but
mightily
enhancing
the
cheerfulness
of
that
portion
of
his
abode,
and
saving
future
housemaids
a
world
of
toil.
The
brown
panelled
parlour
was
furnished
all
in
old
style,
and
with
real
old
furniture.
On
each
side
of
the
high
mantelpiece
stood
two
antique
chairs
of
oak,
solid
as
silvan
thrones,
and
in
one
of
these
sat
a
lady.
But
if
this
were
Miss
Keeldar,
she
must
have
come
of
age
at
least
some
twenty
years
ago.
She
was
of
matronly
form,
and
though
she
wore
no
cap,
and
possessed
hair
of
quite
an
undimmed
auburn,
shading
small
and
naturally
young
looking
features,
she
had
no
youthful
aspect,
nor
apparently
the
wish
to
assume
it.
You
could
have
wished
her
attire
of
a
newer
fashion.
In
a
well
cut,
well
made
gown
hers
would
have
been
no
uncomely
presence.
It
puzzled
you
to
guess
why
a
garment
of
handsome
materials
should
be
arranged
in
such
scanty
folds,
and
devised
after
such
an
obsolete
mode.
You
felt
disposed
to
set
down
the
wearer
as
somewhat
eccentric
at
once.
This
lady
received
the
visitors
with
a
mixture
of
ceremony
and
diffidence
quite
English.
No
middle
aged
matron
who
was
not
an
Englishwoman
could
evince
precisely
the
same
manner
a
manner
so
uncertain
of
herself,
of
her
own
merits,
of
her
power
to
please,
and
yet
so
anxious
to
be
proper,
and,
if
possible,
rather
agreeable
than
otherwise.
In
the
present
instance,
however,
more
embarrassment
was
shown
than
is
usual
even
with
diffident
Englishwomen.
Miss
Helstone
felt
this,
sympathized
with
the
stranger,
and
knowing
by
experience
what
was
good
for
the
timid,
took
a
seat
quietly
near
her,
and
began
to
talk
to
her
with
a
gentle
ease,
communicated
for
the
moment
by
the
presence
of
one
less
self
possessed
than
herself.
She
and
this
lady
would,
if
alone,
have
at
once
got
on
extremely
well
together.
The
lady
had
the
clearest
voice
imaginable
infinitely
softer
and
more
tuneful
than
could
have
been
reasonably
expected
from
forty
years
and
a
form
decidedly
inclined
to
embonpoint.
This
voice
Caroline
liked;
it
atoned
for
the
formal,
if
correct,
accent
and
language.
The
lady
would
soon
have
discovered
she
liked
it
and
her,
and
in
ten
minutes
they
would
have
been
friends.
But
Mr.
Helstone
stood
on
the
rug
looking
at
them
both,
looking
especially
at
the
strange
lady
with
his
sarcastic,
keen
eye,
that
clearly
expressed
impatience
of
her
chilly
ceremony,
and
annoyance
at
her
want
of
aplomb.
His
hard
gaze
and
rasping
voice
discomfited
the
lady
more
and
more.
She
tried,
however,
to
get
up
little
speeches
about
the
weather,
the
aspect
of
the
country,
etc.;
but
the
impracticable
Mr.
Helstone
presently
found
himself
somewhat
deaf.
Whatever
she
said
he
affected
not
to
hear
distinctly,
and
she
was
obliged
to
go
over
each
elaborately
constructed
nothing
twice.
The
effort
soon
became
too
much
for
her.
She
was
just
rising
in
a
perplexed
flutter,
nervously
murmuring
that
she
knew
not
what
detained
Miss
Keeldar,
that
she
would
go
and
look
for
her,
when
Miss
Keeldar
saved
her
the
trouble
by
appearing.
It
was
to
be
presumed
at
least
that
she
who
now
came
in
through
a
glass
door
from
the
garden
owned
that
name.
There
is
real
grace
in
ease
of
manner,
and
so
old
Helstone
felt
when
an
erect,
slight
girl
walked
up
to
him,
retaining
with
her
left
hand
her
little
silk
apron
full
of
flowers,
and,
giving
him
her
right
hand,
said
pleasantly,
"I
knew
you
would
come
to
see
me,
though
you
do
think
Mr.
Yorke
has
made
me
a
Jacobin.
Good
morning."
"But
we'll
not
have
you
a
Jacobin,"
returned
he.
"No,
Miss
Shirley;
they
shall
not
steal
the
flower
of
my
parish
from
me.
Now
that
you
are
amongst
us,
you
shall
be
my
pupil
in
politics
and
religion;
I'll
teach
you
sound
doctrine
on
both
points."
"Mrs.
Pryor
has
anticipated
you,"
she
replied,
turning
to
the
elder
lady.
"Mrs.
Pryor,
you
know,
was
my
governess,
and
is
still
my
friend;
and
of
all
the
high
and
rigid
Tories
she
is
queen;
of
all
the
stanch
churchwomen
she
is
chief.
I
have
been
well
drilled
both
in
theology
and
history,
I
assure
you,
Mr.
Helstone."
The
rector
immediately
bowed
very
low
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
and
expressed
himself
obliged
to
her.
The
ex
governess
disclaimed
skill
either
in
political
or
religious
controversy,
explained
that
she
thought
such
matters
little
adapted
for
female
minds,
but
avowed
herself
in
general
terms
the
advocate
of
order
and
loyalty,
and,
of
course,
truly
attached
to
the
Establishment.
She
added
she
was
ever
averse
to
change
under
any
circumstances,
and
something
scarcely
audible
about
the
extreme
danger
of
being
too
ready
to
take
up
new
ideas
closed
her
sentence.
"Miss
Keeldar
thinks
as
you
think,
I
hope,
madam."
"Difference
of
age
and
difference
of
temperament
occasion
difference
of
sentiment,"
was
the
reply.
"It
can
scarcely
be
expected
that
the
eager
and
young
should
hold
the
opinions
of
the
cool
and
middle
aged."
"Oh!
oh!
we
are
independent;
we
think
for
ourselves!"
cried
Mr.
Helstone.
"We
are
a
little
Jacobin,
for
anything
I
know
a
little
freethinker,
in
good
