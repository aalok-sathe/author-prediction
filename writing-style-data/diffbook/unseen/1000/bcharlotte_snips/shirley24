generally
return
at
seven.
Do
you
wish
me
to
be
at
home
earlier?"
"Try
rather
to
be
back
by
six.
It
is
not
absolutely
dark
at
six
now,
but
by
seven
daylight
is
quite
gone."
"And
what
danger
is
to
be
apprehended,
Caroline,
when
daylight
is
gone?
What
peril
do
you
conceive
comes
as
the
companion
of
darkness
for
me?"
"I
am
not
sure
that
I
can
define
my
fears,
but
we
all
have
a
certain
anxiety
at
present
about
our
friends.
My
uncle
calls
these
times
dangerous.
He
says,
too,
that
mill
owners
are
unpopular."
"And
I
am
one
of
the
most
unpopular?
Is
not
that
the
fact?
You
are
reluctant
to
speak
out
plainly,
but
at
heart
you
think
me
liable
to
Pearson's
fate,
who
was
shot
at
not,
indeed,
from
behind
a
hedge,
but
in
his
own
house,
through
his
staircase
window,
as
he
was
going
to
bed."
"Anne
Pearson
showed
me
the
bullet
in
the
chamber
door,"
remarked
Caroline
gravely,
as
she
folded
her
mantle
and
arranged
it
and
her
muff
on
a
side
table.
"You
know,"
she
continued,
"there
is
a
hedge
all
the
way
along
the
road
from
here
to
Whinbury,
and
there
are
the
Fieldhead
plantations
to
pass;
but
you
will
be
back
by
six
or
before?"
"Certainly
he
will,"
affirmed
Hortense.
"And
now,
my
child,
prepare
your
lessons
for
repetition,
while
I
put
the
peas
to
soak
for
the
puree
at
dinner."
With
this
direction
she
left
the
room.
"You
suspect
I
have
many
enemies,
then,
Caroline,"
said
Mr.
Moore,
"and
doubtless
you
know
me
to
be
destitute
of
friends?"
"Not
destitute,
Robert.
There
is
your
sister,
your
brother
Louis,
whom
I
have
never
seen;
there
is
Mr.
Yorke,
and
there
is
my
uncle
besides,
of
course,
many
more."
Robert
smiled.
"You
would
be
puzzled
to
name
your
'many
more,'"
said
he.
"But
show
me
your
exercise
book.
What
extreme
pains
you
take
with
the
writing!
My
sister,
I
suppose,
exacts
this
care.
She
wants
to
form
you
in
all
things
after
the
model
of
a
Flemish
school
girl.
What
life
are
you
destined
for,
Caroline?
What
will
you
do
with
your
French,
drawing,
and
other
accomplishments,
when
they
are
acquired?"
"You
may
well
say,
when
they
are
acquired;
for,
as
you
are
aware,
till
Hortense
began
to
teach
me,
I
knew
precious
little.
As
to
the
life
I
am
destined
for,
I
cannot
tell.
I
suppose
to
keep
my
uncle's
house
till
"
She
hesitated.
"Till
what?
Till
he
dies?"
"No.
How
harsh
to
say
that!
I
never
think
of
his
dying.
He
is
only
fifty
five.
But
till
in
short,
till
events
offer
other
occupations
for
me."
"A
remarkably
vague
prospect!
Are
you
content
with
it?"
"I
used
to
be,
formerly.
Children,
you
know,
have
little
reflection,
or
rather
their
reflections
run
on
ideal
themes.
There
are
moments
now
when
I
am
not
quite
satisfied."
"Why?"
"I
am
making
no
money
earning
nothing."
"You
come
to
the
point,
Lina.
You
too,
then,
wish
to
make
money?"
"I
do.
I
should
like
an
occupation;
and
if
I
were
a
boy,
it
would
not
be
so
difficult
to
find
one.
I
see
such
an
easy,
pleasant
way
of
learning
a
business,
and
making
my
way
in
life."
"Go
on.
Let
us
hear
what
way."
"I
could
be
apprenticed
to
your
trade
the
cloth
trade.
I
could
learn
it
of
you,
as
we
are
distant
relations.
I
would
do
the
counting
house
work,
keep
the
books,
and
write
the
letters,
while
you
went
to
market.
I
know
you
greatly
desire
to
be
rich,
in
order
to
pay
your
father's
debts;
perhaps
I
could
help
you
to
get
rich."
"Help
me?
You
should
think
of
yourself."
"I
do
think
of
myself;
but
must
one
for
ever
think
only
of
oneself?"
"Of
whom
else
do
I
think?
Of
whom
else
dare
I
think?
The
poor
ought
to
have
no
large
sympathies;
it
is
their
duty
to
be
narrow."
"No,
Robert
"
"Yes,
Caroline.
Poverty
is
necessarily
selfish,
contracted,
grovelling,
anxious.
Now
and
then
a
poor
man's
heart,
when
certain
beams
and
dews
visit
it,
may
smell
like
the
budding
vegetation
in
yonder
garden
on
this
spring
day,
may
feel
ripe
to
evolve
in
foliage,
perhaps
blossom;
but
he
must
not
encourage
the
pleasant
impulse;
he
must
invoke
Prudence
to
check
it,
with
that
frosty
breath
of
hers,
which
is
as
nipping
as
any
north
wind."
"No
cottage
would
be
happy
then."
"When
I
speak
of
poverty,
I
do
not
so
much
mean
the
natural,
habitual
poverty
of
the
working
man,
as
the
embarrassed
penury
of
the
man
in
debt.
My
grub
worm
is
always
a
straitened,
struggling,
care
worn
tradesman."
"Cherish
hope,
not
anxiety.
Certain
ideas
have
become
too
fixed
in
your
mind.
It
may
be
presumptuous
to
say
it,
but
I
have
the
impression
that
there
is
something
wrong
in
your
notions
of
the
best
means
of
attaining
happiness,
as
there
is
in
"
Second
hesitation.
"I
am
all
ear,
Caroline."
"In
(courage!
let
me
speak
the
truth)
in
your
manner
mind,
I
say
only
manner
to
these
Yorkshire
workpeople."
"You
have
often
wanted
to
tell
me
that,
have
you
not?"
"Yes;
often
very
often."
"The
faults
of
my
manner
are,
I
think,
only
negative.
I
am
not
proud.
What
has
a
man
in
my
position
to
be
proud
of?
I
am
only
taciturn,
phlegmatic,
and
joyless."
"As
if
your
living
cloth
dressers
were
all
machines
like
your
frames
and
shears.
In
your
own
house
you
seem
different."
"To
those
of
my
own
house
I
am
no
alien,
which
I
am
to
these
English
clowns.
I
might
act
the
benevolent
with
them,
but
acting
is
not
my
forte.
I
find
them
irrational,
perverse;
they
hinder
me
when
I
long
to
hurry
forward.
In
treating
them
justly
I
fulfil
my
whole
duty
towards
them."
"You
don't
expect
them
to
love
you,
of
course?"
"Nor
wish
it."
"Ah!"
said
the
monitress,
shaking
her
head
and
heaving
