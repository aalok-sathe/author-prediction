Highlands.
We
will,
if
you
can
bear
a
sea
voyage,
go
to
the
Isles
the
Hebrides,
the
Shetland,
the
Orkney
Islands.
Would
you
not
like
that?
I
see
you
would.
Mrs.
Pryor,
I
call
you
to
witness.
Her
face
is
all
sunshine
at
the
bare
mention
of
it."
"I
should
like
it
much,"
returned
Caroline,
to
whom,
indeed,
the
notion
of
such
a
tour
was
not
only
pleasant,
but
gloriously
reviving.
Shirley
rubbed
her
hands.
"Come;
I
can
bestow
a
benefit,"
she
exclaimed.
"I
can
do
a
good
deed
with
my
cash.
My
thousand
a
year
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
dirty
bank
notes
and
jaundiced
guineas
(let
me
speak
respectfully
of
both,
though,
for
I
adore
them),
but,
it
may
be,
health
to
the
drooping,
strength
to
the
weak,
consolation
to
the
sad.
I
was
determined
to
make
something
of
it
better
than
a
fine
old
house
to
live
in,
than
satin
gowns
to
wear,
better
than
deference
from
acquaintance
and
homage
from
the
poor.
Here
is
to
begin.
This
summer,
Caroline,
Mrs.
Pryor
and
I
go
out
into
the
North
Atlantic,
beyond
the
Shetland,
perhaps
to
the
Faroe
Isles.
We
will
see
seals
in
Suderoe,
and,
doubtless,
mermaids
in
Stromoe.
Caroline
is
laughing,
Mrs.
Pryor.
I
made
her
laugh;
I
have
done
her
good."
"I
shall
like
to
go,
Shirley,"
again
said
Miss
Helstone.
"I
long
to
hear
the
sound
of
waves
ocean
waves
and
to
see
them
as
I
have
imagined
them
in
dreams,
like
tossing
banks
of
green
light,
strewed
with
vanishing
and
reappearing
wreaths
of
foam,
whiter
than
lilies.
I
shall
delight
to
pass
the
shores
of
those
lone
rock
islets
where
the
sea
birds
live
and
breed
unmolested.
We
shall
be
on
the
track
of
the
old
Scandinavians
of
the
Norsemen.
We
shall
almost
see
the
shores
of
Norway.
This
is
a
very
vague
delight
that
I
feel,
communicated
by
your
proposal,
but
it
is
a
delight."
"Will
you
think
of
Fitful
Head
now
when
you
lie
awake
at
night,
of
gulls
shrieking
round
it,
and
waves
tumbling
in
upon
it,
rather
than
of
the
graves
under
the
rectory
back
kitchen?"
"I
will
try;
and
instead
of
musing
about
remnants
of
shrouds,
and
fragments
of
coffins,
and
human
bones
and
mould,
I
will
fancy
seals
lying
in
the
sunshine
on
solitary
shores,
where
neither
fisherman
nor
hunter
ever
come;
of
rock
crevices
full
of
pearly
eggs
bedded
in
seaweed;
of
unscared
birds
covering
white
sands
in
happy
flocks."
"And
what
will
become
of
that
inexpressible
weight
you
said
you
had
on
your
mind?"
"I
will
try
to
forget
it
in
speculation
on
the
sway
of
the
whole
great
deep
above
a
herd
of
whales
rushing
through
the
livid
and
liquid
thunder
down
from
the
frozen
zone
a
hundred
of
them,
perhaps,
wallowing,
flashing,
rolling
in
the
wake
of
a
patriarch
bull,
huge
enough
to
have
been
spawned
before
the
Flood,
such
a
creature
as
poor
Smart
had
in
his
mind
when
he
said,
'Strong
against
tides,
the
enormous
whale
Emerges
as
he
goes.'"
"I
hope
our
bark
will
meet
with
no
such
shoal,
or
herd
as
you
term
it,
Caroline.
(I
suppose
you
fancy
the
sea
mammoths
pasturing
about
the
bases
of
the
'everlasting
hills,'
devouring
strange
provender
in
the
vast
valleys
through
and
above
which
sea
billows
roll.)
I
should
not
like
to
be
capsized
by
the
patriarch
bull."
"I
suppose
you
expect
to
see
mermaids,
Shirley?"
"One
of
them,
at
any
rate
I
do
not
bargain
for
less
and
she
is
to
appear
in
some
such
fashion
as
this.
I
am
to
be
walking
by
myself
on
deck,
rather
late
of
an
August
evening,
watching
and
being
watched
by
a
full
harvest
moon.
Something
is
to
rise
white
on
the
surface
of
the
sea,
over
which
that
moon
mounts
silent
and
hangs
glorious.
The
object
glitters
and
sinks.
It
rises
again.
I
think
I
hear
it
cry
with
an
articulate
voice;
I
call
you
up
from
the
cabin;
I
show
you
an
image,
fair
as
alabaster,
emerging
from
the
dim
wave.
We
both
see
the
long
hair,
the
lifted
and
foam
white
arm,
the
oval
mirror
brilliant
as
a
star.
It
glides
nearer;
a
human
face
is
plainly
visible
a
face
in
the
style
of
yours
whose
straight,
pure
(excuse
the
word,
it
is
appropriate)
whose
straight,
pure
lineaments
paleness
does
not
disfigure.
It
looks
at
us,
but
not
with
your
eyes.
I
see
a
preternatural
lure
in
its
wily
glance.
It
beckons.
Were
we
men,
we
should
spring
at
the
sign
the
cold
billow
would
be
dared
for
the
sake
of
the
colder
enchantress;
being
women,
we
stand
safe,
though
not
dreadless.
She
comprehends
our
unmoved
gaze;
she
feels
herself
powerless;
anger
crosses
her
front;
she
cannot
charm,
but
she
will
appal
us;
she
rises
high,
and
glides
all
revealed
on
the
dark
wave
ridge.
Temptress
terror!
monstrous
likeness
of
ourselves!
Are
you
not
glad,
Caroline,
when
at
last,
and
with
a
wild
shriek,
she
dives?"
"But,
Shirley,
she
is
not
like
us.
We
are
neither
temptresses,
nor
terrors,
nor
monsters."
"Some
of
our
kind,
it
is
said,
are
all
three.
There
are
men
who
ascribe
to
'woman,'
in
general,
such
attributes."
"My
dears,"
here
interrupted
Mrs.
Pryor,
"does
it
not
strike
you
that
your
conversation
for
the
last
ten
minutes
has
been
rather
fanciful?"
"But
there
is
no
harm
in
our
fancies;
is
there,
ma'am?"
"We
are
aware
that
mermaids
do
not
exist;
why
speak
of
them
as
if
they
did?
How
can
you
find
interest
in
speaking
of
a
nonentity?"
"I
don't
know,"
said
Shirley.
"My
dear,
I
think
there
is
an
arrival.
I
heard
a
step
in
the
lane
while
you
were
talking;
and
is
not
that
the
garden
gate
which
creaks?"
Shirley
stepped
to
the
window.
"Yes,
there
is
some
one,"
said
she,
turning
quietly
away;
and
as
she
resumed
her
seat
a
sensitive
flush
animated
her
face,
while
a
trembling
ray
at
once
kindled
and
