"Yes,"
said
her
pupil,
"I
know
what
that
smile
means.
You
are
thinking
of
my
gentleman
tenant.
Do
you
know
Mr.
Moore
of
the
Hollow?"
she
asked
Mr.
Helstone.
"Ay!
ay!
Your
tenant
so
he
is.
You
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
him,
no
doubt,
since
you
came?"
"I
have
been
obliged
to
see
him.
There
was
business
to
transact.
Business!
Really
the
word
makes
me
conscious
I
am
indeed
no
longer
a
girl,
but
quite
a
woman
and
something
more.
I
am
an
esquire!
Shirley
Keeldar,
Esquire,
ought
to
be
my
style
and
title.
They
gave
me
a
man's
name;
I
hold
a
man's
position.
It
is
enough
to
inspire
me
with
a
touch
of
manhood;
and
when
I
see
such
people
as
that
stately
Anglo
Belgian
that
Gerard
Moore
before
me,
gravely
talking
to
me
of
business,
really
I
feel
quite
gentlemanlike.
You
must
choose
me
for
your
churchwarden,
Mr.
Helstone,
the
next
time
you
elect
new
ones.
They
ought
to
make
me
a
magistrate
and
a
captain
of
yeomanry.
Tony
Lumpkin's
mother
was
a
colonel,
and
his
aunt
a
justice
of
the
peace.
Why
shouldn't
I
be?"
"With
all
my
heart.
If
you
choose
to
get
up
a
requisition
on
the
subject,
I
promise
to
head
the
list
of
signatures
with
my
name.
But
you
were
speaking
of
Moore?"
"Ah!
yes.
I
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
understand
Mr.
Moore,
to
know
what
to
think
of
him,
whether
to
like
him
or
not.
He
seems
a
tenant
of
whom
any
proprietor
might
be
proud
and
proud
of
him
I
am,
in
that
sense;
but
as
a
neighbour,
what
is
he?
Again
and
again
I
have
entreated
Mrs.
Pryor
to
say
what
she
thinks
of
him,
but
she
still
evades
returning
a
direct
answer.
I
hope
you
will
be
less
oracular,
Mr.
Helstone,
and
pronounce
at
once.
Do
you
like
him?"
"Not
at
all,
just
now.
His
name
is
entirely
blotted
from
my
good
books."
"What
is
the
matter?
What
has
he
done?"
"My
uncle
and
he
disagree
on
politics,"
interposed
the
low
voice
of
Caroline.
She
had
better
not
have
spoken
just
then.
Having
scarcely
joined
in
the
conversation
before,
it
was
not
apropos
to
do
it
now.
She
felt
this
with
nervous
acuteness
as
soon
as
she
had
spoken,
and
coloured
to
the
eyes.
"What
are
Moore's
politics?"
inquired
Shirley.
"Those
of
a
tradesman,"
returned
the
rector
"narrow,
selfish,
and
unpatriotic.
The
man
is
eternally
writing
and
speaking
against
the
continuance
of
the
war.
I
have
no
patience
with
him."
"The
war
hurts
his
trade.
I
remember
he
remarked
that
only
yesterday.
But
what
other
objection
have
you
to
him?"
"That
is
enough."
"He
looks
the
gentleman,
in
my
sense
of
the
term,"
pursued
Shirley,
"and
it
pleases
me
to
think
he
is
such."
Caroline
rent
the
Tyrian
petals
of
the
one
brilliant
flower
in
her
bouquet,
and
answered
in
distinct
tones,
"Decidedly
he
is."
Shirley,
hearing
this
courageous
affirmation,
flashed
an
arch,
searching
glance
at
the
speaker
from
her
deep,
expressive
eyes.
"You
are
his
friend,
at
any
rate,"
she
said.
"You
defend
him
in
his
absence."
"I
am
both
his
friend
and
his
relative,"
was
the
prompt
reply.
"Robert
Moore
is
my
cousin."
"Oh,
then,
you
can
tell
me
all
about
him.
Just
give
me
a
sketch
of
his
character."
Insuperable
embarrassment
seized
Caroline
when
this
demand
was
made.
She
could
not,
and
did
not,
attempt
to
comply
with
it.
Her
silence
was
immediately
covered
by
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
proceeded
to
address
sundry
questions
to
Mr.
Helstone
regarding
a
family
or
two
in
the
neighbourhood,
with
whose
connections
in
the
south
she
said
she
was
acquainted.
Shirley
soon
withdrew
her
gaze
from
Miss
Helstone's
face.
She
did
not
renew
her
interrogations,
but
returning
to
her
flowers,
proceeded
to
choose
a
nosegay
for
the
rector.
She
presented
it
to
him
as
he
took
leave,
and
received
the
homage
of
a
salute
on
the
hand
in
return.
"Be
sure
you
wear
it
for
my
sake,"
said
she.
"Next
my
heart,
of
course,"
responded
Helstone.
"Mrs.
Pryor,
take
care
of
this
future
magistrate,
this
churchwarden
in
perspective,
this
captain
of
yeomanry,
this
young
squire
of
Briarfield,
in
a
word.
Don't
let
him
exert
himself
too
much;
don't
let
him
break
his
neck
in
hunting;
especially,
let
him
mind
how
he
rides
down
that
dangerous
hill
near
the
Hollow."
"I
like
a
descent,"
said
Shirley;
"I
like
to
clear
it
rapidly;
and
especially
I
like
that
romantic
Hollow
with
all
my
heart."
"Romantic,
with
a
mill
in
it?"
"Romantic
with
a
mill
in
it.
The
old
mill
and
the
white
cottage
are
each
admirable
in
its
way."
"And
the
counting
house,
Mr.
Keeldar?"
"The
counting
house
is
better
than
my
bloom
coloured
drawing
room.
I
adore
the
counting
house."
"And
the
trade?
The
cloth,
the
greasy
wool,
the
polluting
dyeing
vats?"
"The
trade
is
to
be
thoroughly
respected."
"And
the
tradesman
is
a
hero?
Good!"
"I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so.
I
thought
the
tradesman
looked
heroic."
Mischief,
spirit,
and
glee
sparkled
all
over
her
face
as
she
thus
bandied
words
with
the
old
Cossack,
who
almost
equally
enjoyed
the
tilt.
"Captain
Keeldar,
you
have
no
mercantile
blood
in
your
veins.
Why
are
you
so
fond
of
trade?"
"Because
I
am
a
mill
owner,
of
course.
Half
my
income
comes
from
the
works
in
that
Hollow."
"Don't
enter
into
partnership
that's
all."
"You've
put
it
into
my
head!
you've
put
it
into
my
head!"
she
exclaimed,
with
a
joyous
laugh.
"It
will
never
get
out.
Thank
you."
And
waving
her
hand,
white
as
a
lily
and
fine
as
a
fairy's,
she
vanished
within
the
porch,
while
the
rector
and
his
niece
passed
out
through
the
arched
gateway.
Shirley
showed
she
had
been
sincere
in
saying
she
should
be
glad
of
Caroline's
society,
by
frequently
seeking
it;
and,
indeed,
if
she
had
not
sought
it,
she
would
not
have
had
it,
for
Miss
Helstone
was
