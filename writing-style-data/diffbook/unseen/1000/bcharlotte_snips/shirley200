mewed
up,
kept
in
solitary
confinement.
They
mean
to
make
either
an
idiot
or
a
maniac
of
him,
and
take
out
a
commission
of
lunacy.
Horsfall
starves
him;
you
saw
how
thin
he
was."
"You
were
very
good
the
other
day,
Martin."
"What
day?
I
am
always
good
a
model."
"When
will
you
be
so
good
again?"
"I
see
what
you
are
after;
but
you'll
not
wheedle
me
I
am
no
cat's
paw."
"But
it
must
be
done.
It
is
quite
a
right
thing,
and
a
necessary
thing."
"How
you
encroach!
Remember,
I
managed
the
matter
of
my
own
free
will
before."
"And
you
will
again."
"I
won't.
The
business
gave
me
far
too
much
trouble.
I
like
my
ease."
"Mr.
Moore
wishes
to
see
me,
Martin,
and
I
wish
to
see
him."
"I
dare
say"
(coolly).
"It
is
too
bad
of
your
mother
to
exclude
his
friends."
"Tell
her
so."
"His
own
relations."
"Come
and
blow
her
up."
"You
know
that
would
advance
nothing.
Well,
I
shall
stick
to
my
point.
See
him
I
will.
If
you
won't
help
me,
I'll
manage
without
help."
"Do;
there
is
nothing
like
self
reliance,
self
dependence."
"I
have
no
time
to
reason
with
you
now;
but
I
consider
you
provoking.
Good
morning."
Away
she
went,
the
umbrella
shut,
for
she
could
not
carry
it
against
the
wind.
"She
is
not
vapid;
she
is
not
shallow,"
said
Martin.
"I
shall
like
to
watch,
and
mark
how
she
will
work
her
way
without
help.
If
the
storm
were
not
of
snow,
but
of
fire
such
as
came
refreshingly
down
on
the
cities
of
the
plain
she
would
go
through
it
to
procure
five
minutes'
speech
of
that
Moore.
Now,
I
consider
I
have
had
a
pleasant
morning.
The
disappointments
got
time
on;
the
fears
and
fits
of
anger
only
made
that
short
discourse
pleasanter,
when
it
came
at
last.
She
expected
to
coax
me
at
once.
She'll
not
manage
that
in
one
effort.
She
shall
come
again,
again,
and
yet
again.
It
would
please
me
to
put
her
in
a
passion
to
make
her
cry.
I
want
to
discover
how
far
she
will
go
what
she
will
do
and
dare
to
get
her
will.
It
seems
strange
and
new
to
find
one
human
being
thinking
so
much
about
another
as
she
thinks
about
Moore.
But
it
is
time
to
go
home;
my
appetite
tells
me
the
hour.
Won't
I
walk
into
that
goose?
and
we'll
try
whether
Matthew
or
I
shall
get
the
largest
cut
of
the
apple
pie
to
day."
Martin
had
planned
well.
He
had
laid
out
a
dexterously
concerted
scheme
for
his
private
amusement.
But
older
and
wiser
schemers
than
he
are
often
doomed
to
see
their
finest
spun
projects
swept
to
annihilation
by
the
sudden
broom
of
Fate,
that
fell
housewife
whose
red
arm
none
can
control.
In
the
present
instance
this
broom
was
manufactured
out
of
the
tough
fibres
of
Moore's
own
stubborn
purpose,
bound
tight
with
his
will.
He
was
now
resuming
his
strength,
and
making
strange
head
against
Mrs.
Horsfall.
Each
morning
he
amazed
that
matron
with
a
fresh
astonishment.
First
he
discharged
her
from
her
valet
duties;
he
would
dress
himself.
Then
he
refused
the
coffee
she
brought
him;
he
would
breakfast
with
the
family.
Lastly,
he
forbade
her
his
chamber.
On
the
same
day,
amidst
the
outcries
of
all
the
women
in
the
place,
he
put
his
head
out
of
doors.
The
morning
after,
he
followed
Mr.
Yorke
to
his
counting
house,
and
requested
an
envoy
to
fetch
a
chaise
from
the
Red
House
Inn.
He
was
resolved,
he
said,
to
return
home
to
the
Hollow
that
very
afternoon.
Mr.
Yorke,
instead
of
opposing,
aided
and
abetted
him.
The
chaise
was
sent
for,
though
Mrs.
Yorke
declared
the
step
would
be
his
death.
It
came.
Moore,
little
disposed
to
speak,
made
his
purse
do
duty
for
his
tongue.
He
expressed
his
gratitude
to
the
servants
and
to
Mrs.
Horsfall
by
the
chink
of
his
coin.
The
latter
personage
approved
and
understood
this
language
perfectly;
it
made
amends
for
all
previous
contumacy.
She
and
her
patient
parted
the
best
friends
in
the
world.
The
kitchen
visited
and
soothed,
Moore
betook
himself
to
the
parlour.
He
had
Mrs.
Yorke
to
appease;
not
quite
so
easy
a
task
as
the
pacification
of
her
housemaids.
There
she
sat
plunged
in
sullen
dudgeon,
the
gloomiest
speculations
on
the
depths
of
man's
ingratitude
absorbing
her
thoughts.
He
drew
near
and
bent
over
her;
she
was
obliged
to
look
up,
if
it
were
only
to
bid
him
"avaunt."
There
was
beauty
still
in
his
pale,
wasted
features;
there
was
earnestness
and
a
sort
of
sweetness
for
he
was
smiling
in
his
hollow
eyes.
"Good
bye!"
he
said,
and
as
he
spoke
the
smile
glittered
and
melted.
He
had
no
iron
mastery
of
his
sensations
now;
a
trifling
emotion
made
itself
apparent
in
his
present
weak
state.
"And
what
are
you
going
to
leave
us
for?"
she
asked.
"We
will
keep
you,
and
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you,
if
you
will
only
stay
till
you
are
stronger."
"Good
bye!"
he
again
said;
and
added,
"You
have
been
a
mother
to
me;
give
your
wilful
son
one
embrace."
Like
a
foreigner,
as
he
was,
he
offered
her
first
one
cheek,
then
the
other.
She
kissed
him.
"What
a
trouble
what
a
burden
I
have
been
to
you!"
he
muttered.
"You
are
the
worst
trouble
now,
headstrong
youth!"
was
the
answer.
"I
wonder
who
is
to
nurse
you
at
Hollow's
Cottage?
Your
sister
Hortense
knows
no
more
about
such
matters
than
a
child."
"Thank
God!
for
I
have
had
nursing
enough
to
last
me
my
life."
Here
the
little
girls
came
in
Jessie
crying,
Rose
quiet
but
grave.
Moore
took
them
out
into
the
hall
to
soothe,
pet,
and
kiss
them.
He
knew
it
was
not
in
their
mother's
nature
to
bear
to
see
any
living
thing
caressed
but
herself.
She
would
have
