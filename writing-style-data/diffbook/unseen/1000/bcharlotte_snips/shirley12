the
rescue
party
set
out.
Cheerfulness,
it
would
appear,
is
a
matter
which
depends
fully
as
much
on
the
state
of
things
within
as
on
the
state
of
things
without
and
around
us.
I
make
this
trite
remark,
because
I
happen
to
know
that
Messrs.
Helstone
and
Moore
trotted
forth
from
the
mill
yard
gates,
at
the
head
of
their
very
small
company,
in
the
best
possible
spirits.
When
a
ray
from
a
lantern
(the
three
pedestrians
of
the
party
carried
each
one)
fell
on
Mr.
Moore's
face,
you
could
see
an
unusual,
because
a
lively,
spark
dancing
in
his
eyes,
and
a
new
found
vivacity
mantling
on
his
dark
physiognomy;
and
when
the
rector's
visage
was
illuminated,
his
hard
features
were
revealed
all
agrin
and
ashine
with
glee.
Yet
a
drizzling
night,
a
somewhat
perilous
expedition,
you
would
think
were
not
circumstances
calculated
to
enliven
those
exposed
to
the
wet
and
engaged
in
the
adventure.
If
any
member
or
members
of
the
crew
who
had
been
at
work
on
Stilbro'
Moor
had
caught
a
view
of
this
party,
they
would
have
had
great
pleasure
in
shooting
either
of
the
leaders
from
behind
a
wall:
and
the
leaders
knew
this;
and
the
fact
is,
being
both
men
of
steely
nerves
and
steady
beating
hearts,
were
elate
with
the
knowledge.
I
am
aware,
reader,
and
you
need
not
remind
me,
that
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
for
a
parson
to
be
warlike;
I
am
aware
that
he
should
be
a
man
of
peace.
I
have
some
faint
outline
of
an
idea
of
what
a
clergyman's
mission
is
amongst
mankind,
and
I
remember
distinctly
whose
servant
he
is,
whose
message
he
delivers,
whose
example
he
should
follow;
yet,
with
all
this,
if
you
are
a
parson
hater,
you
need
not
expect
me
to
go
along
with
you
every
step
of
your
dismal,
downward
tending,
unchristian
road;
you
need
not
expect
me
to
join
in
your
deep
anathemas,
at
once
so
narrow
and
so
sweeping,
in
your
poisonous
rancour,
so
intense
and
so
absurd,
against
"the
cloth;"
to
lift
up
my
eyes
and
hands
with
a
Supplehough,
or
to
inflate
my
lungs
with
a
Barraclough,
in
horror
and
denunciation
of
the
diabolical
rector
of
Briarfield.
He
was
not
diabolical
at
all.
The
evil
simply
was
he
had
missed
his
vocation.
He
should
have
been
a
soldier,
and
circumstances
had
made
him
a
priest.
For
the
rest,
he
was
a
conscientious,
hard
headed,
hard
handed,
brave,
stern,
implacable,
faithful
little
man;
a
man
almost
without
sympathy,
ungentle,
prejudiced,
and
rigid,
but
a
man
true
to
principle,
honourable,
sagacious,
and
sincere.
It
seems
to
me,
reader,
that
you
cannot
always
cut
out
men
to
fit
their
profession,
and
that
you
ought
not
to
curse
them
because
their
profession
sometimes
hangs
on
them
ungracefully.
Nor
will
I
curse
Helstone,
clerical
Cossack
as
he
was.
Yet
he
was
cursed,
and
by
many
of
his
own
parishioners,
as
by
others
he
was
adored
which
is
the
frequent
fate
of
men
who
show
partiality
in
friendship
and
bitterness
in
enmity,
who
are
equally
attached
to
principles
and
adherent
to
prejudices.
Helstone
and
Moore
being
both
in
excellent
spirits,
and
united
for
the
present
in
one
cause,
you
would
expect
that,
as
they
rode
side
by
side,
they
would
converse
amicably.
Oh
no!
These
two
men,
of
hard,
bilious
natures
both,
rarely
came
into
contact
but
they
chafed
each
other's
moods.
Their
frequent
bone
of
contention
was
the
war.
Helstone
was
a
high
Tory
(there
were
Tories
in
those
days),
and
Moore
was
a
bitter
Whig
a
Whig,
at
least,
as
far
as
opposition
to
the
war
party
was
concerned,
that
being
the
question
which
affected
his
own
interest;
and
only
on
that
question
did
he
profess
any
British
politics
at
all.
He
liked
to
infuriate
Helstone
by
declaring
his
belief
in
the
invincibility
of
Bonaparte,
by
taunting
England
and
Europe
with
the
impotence
of
their
efforts
to
withstand
him,
and
by
coolly
advancing
the
opinion
that
it
was
as
well
to
yield
to
him
soon
as
late,
since
he
must
in
the
end
crush
every
antagonist,
and
reign
supreme.
Helstone
could
not
bear
these
sentiments.
It
was
only
on
the
consideration
of
Moore
being
a
sort
of
outcast
and
alien,
and
having
but
half
measure
of
British
blood
to
temper
the
foreign
gall
which
corroded
his
veins,
that
he
brought
himself
to
listen
to
them
without
indulging
the
wish
he
felt
to
cane
the
speaker.
Another
thing,
too,
somewhat
allayed
his
disgust
namely,
a
fellow
feeling
for
the
dogged
tone
with
which
these
opinions
were
asserted,
and
a
respect
for
the
consistency
of
Moore's
crabbed
contumacy.
As
the
party
turned
into
the
Stilbro'
road,
they
met
what
little
wind
there
was;
the
rain
dashed
in
their
faces.
Moore
had
been
fretting
his
companion
previously,
and
now,
braced
up
by
the
raw
breeze,
and
perhaps
irritated
by
the
sharp
drizzle,
he
began
to
goad
him.
"Does
your
Peninsular
news
please
you
still?"
he
asked.
"What
do
you
mean?"
was
the
surly
demand
of
the
rector.
"I
mean,
have
you
still
faith
in
that
Baal
of
a
Lord
Wellington?"
"And
what
do
you
mean
now?"
"Do
you
still
believe
that
this
wooden
faced
and
pebble
hearted
idol
of
England
has
power
to
send
fire
down
from
heaven
to
consume
the
French
holocaust
you
want
to
offer
up?"
"I
believe
Wellington
will
flog
Bonaparte's
marshals
into
the
sea
the
day
it
pleases
him
to
lift
his
arm."
"But,
my
dear
sir,
you
can't
be
serious
in
what
you
say.
Bonaparte's
marshals
are
great
men,
who
act
under
the
guidance
of
an
omnipotent
master
spirit.
Your
Wellington
is
the
most
humdrum
of
commonplace
martinets,
whose
slow,
mechanical
movements
are
further
cramped
by
an
ignorant
home
government."
"Wellington
is
the
soul
of
England.
Wellington
is
the
right
champion
of
a
good
cause,
the
fit
representative
of
a
powerful,
a
resolute,
a
sensible,
and
an
honest
nation."
"Your
good
cause,
as
far
as
I
understand
