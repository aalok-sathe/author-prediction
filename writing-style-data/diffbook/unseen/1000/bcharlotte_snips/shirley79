child
why
do
you
not
bear
me
company?
I
only
weep
tears,
delightful
and
soon
wiped
away;
you
might
weep
gall,
if
you
choose."
"Why
should
I
weep
gall?"
"Mateless,
solitary
bird!"
was
the
only
answer.
"And
are
not
you
too
mateless,
Shirley?"
"At
heart
no."
"Oh!
who
nestles
there,
Shirley?"
But
Shirley
only
laughed
gaily
at
this
question,
and
alertly
started
up.
"I
have
dreamed,"
she
said,
"a
mere
day
dream
certainly
bright,
probably
baseless!"
Miss
Helstone
was
by
this
time
free
enough
from
illusions:
she
took
a
sufficiently
grave
view
of
the
future,
and
fancied
she
knew
pretty
well
how
her
own
destiny
and
that
of
some
others
were
tending.
Yet
old
associations
retained
their
influence
over
her,
and
it
was
these
and
the
power
of
habit
which
still
frequently
drew
her
of
an
evening
to
the
field
style
and
the
old
thorn
overlooking
the
Hollow.
One
night,
the
night
after
the
incident
of
the
note,
she
had
been
at
her
usual
post,
watching
for
her
beacon
watching
vainly:
that
evening
no
lamp
was
lit.
She
waited
till
the
rising
of
certain
constellations
warned
her
of
lateness
and
signed
her
away.
In
passing
Fieldhead,
on
her
return,
its
moonlight
beauty
attracted
her
glance,
and
stayed
her
step
an
instant.
Tree
and
hall
rose
peaceful
under
the
night
sky
and
clear
full
orb;
pearly
paleness
gilded
the
building;
mellow
brown
gloom
bosomed
it
round;
shadows
of
deep
green
brooded
above
its
oak
wreathed
roof.
The
broad
pavement
in
front
shone
pale
also;
it
gleamed
as
if
some
spell
had
transformed
the
dark
granite
to
glistering
Parian.
On
the
silvery
space
slept
two
sable
shadows,
thrown
sharply
defined
from
two
human
figures.
These
figures
when
first
seen
were
motionless
and
mute;
presently
they
moved
in
harmonious
step,
and
spoke
low
in
harmonious
key.
Earnest
was
the
gaze
that
scrutinized
them
as
they
emerged
from
behind
the
trunk
of
the
cedar.
"Is
it
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Shirley?"
Certainly
it
is
Shirley.
Who
else
has
a
shape
so
lithe,
and
proud,
and
graceful?
And
her
face,
too,
is
visible
her
countenance
careless
and
pensive,
and
musing
and
mirthful,
and
mocking
and
tender.
Not
fearing
the
dew,
she
has
not
covered
her
head;
her
curls
are
free
they
veil
her
neck
and
caress
her
shoulder
with
their
tendril
rings.
An
ornament
of
gold
gleams
through
the
half
closed
folds
of
the
scarf
she
has
wrapped
across
her
bust,
and
a
large
bright
gem
glitters
on
the
white
hand
which
confines
it.
Yes,
that
is
Shirley.
Her
companion
then
is,
of
course,
Mrs.
Pryor?
Yes,
if
Mrs.
Pryor
owns
six
feet
of
stature,
and
if
she
has
changed
her
decent
widow's
weeds
for
masculine
disguise.
The
figure
walking
at
Miss
Keeldar's
side
is
a
man
a
tall,
young,
stately
man;
it
is
her
tenant,
Robert
Moore.
The
pair
speak
softly;
their
words
are
not
distinguishable.
To
remain
a
moment
to
gaze
is
not
to
be
an
eavesdropper;
and
as
the
moon
shines
so
clearly
and
their
countenances
are
so
distinctly
apparent,
who
can
resist
the
attraction
of
such
interest?
Caroline,
it
seems,
cannot,
for
she
lingers.
There
was
a
time
when,
on
summer
nights,
Moore
had
been
wont
to
walk
with
his
cousin,
as
he
was
now
walking
with
the
heiress.
Often
had
she
gone
up
the
Hollow
with
him
after
sunset,
to
scent
the
freshness
of
the
earth,
where
a
growth
of
fragrant
herbage
carpeted
a
certain
narrow
terrace,
edging
a
deep
ravine,
from
whose
rifted
gloom
was
heard
a
sound
like
the
spirit
of
the
lonely
watercourse,
moaning
amongst
its
wet
stones,
and
between
its
weedy
banks,
and
under
its
dark
bower
of
alders.
"But
I
used
to
be
closer
to
him,"
thought
Caroline.
"He
felt
no
obligation
to
treat
me
with
homage;
I
needed
only
kindness.
He
used
to
hold
my
hand;
he
does
not
touch
hers.
And
yet
Shirley
is
not
proud
where
she
loves.
There
is
no
haughtiness
in
her
aspect
now,
only
a
little
in
her
port
what
is
natural
to
and
inseparable
from
her,
what
she
retains
in
her
most
careless
as
in
her
most
guarded
moments.
Robert
must
think,
as
I
think,
that
he
is
at
this
instant
looking
down
on
a
fine
face;
and
he
must
think
it
with
a
man's
brain,
not
with
mine.
She
has
such
generous
yet
soft
fire
in
her
eyes.
She
smiles
what
makes
her
smile
so
sweet?
I
saw
that
Robert
felt
its
beauty,
and
he
must
have
felt
it
with
his
man's
heart,
not
with
my
dim
woman's
perceptions.
They
look
to
me
like
two
great
happy
spirits.
Yonder
silvered
pavement
reminds
me
of
that
white
shore
we
believe
to
be
beyond
the
death
flood.
They
have
reached
it;
they
walk
there
united.
And
what
am
I,
standing
here
in
shadow,
shrinking
into
concealment,
my
mind
darker
than
my
hiding
place?
I
am
one
of
this
world,
no
spirit
a
poor
doomed
mortal,
who
asks,
in
ignorance
and
hopelessness,
wherefore
she
was
born,
to
what
end
she
lives;
whose
mind
for
ever
runs
on
the
question,
how
she
shall
at
last
encounter,
and
by
whom
be
sustained
through
death.
"This
is
the
worst
passage
I
have
come
to
yet;
still
I
was
quite
prepared
for
it.
I
gave
Robert
up,
and
gave
him
up
to
Shirley,
the
first
day
I
heard
she
was
come,
the
first
moment
I
saw
her
rich,
youthful,
and
lovely.
She
has
him
now.
He
is
her
lover.
She
is
his
darling.
She
will
be
far
more
his
darling
yet
when
they
are
married.
The
more
Robert
knows
of
Shirley
the
more
his
soul
will
cleave
to
her.
They
will
both
be
happy,
and
I
do
not
grudge
them
their
bliss;
but
I
groan
under
my
own
misery.
Some
of
my
suffering
is
very
acute.
Truly
I
ought
not
to
have
been
born;
they
should
have
smothered
me
at
the
first
cry."
Here,
Shirley
stepping
aside
to
gather
a
dewy
flower,
she
and
her
