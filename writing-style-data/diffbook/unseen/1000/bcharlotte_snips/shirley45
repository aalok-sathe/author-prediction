of
the
working
classes
no
longer;
he
had
considered
of
it,
and
made
up
his
mind
to
go
all
lengths;
if
money
and
spirit
could
put
down
these
rioters,
they
should
be
put
down;
Mr.
Moore
might
do
as
he
liked,
but
he
Christie
Sykes
would
spend
his
last
penny
in
law
before
he
would
be
beaten;
he'd
settle
them,
or
he'd
see.
"Take
another
glass,"
urged
Moore.
Mr.
Sykes
didn't
mind
if
he
did.
This
was
a
cold
morning
(Sugden
had
found
it
a
warm
one);
it
was
necessary
to
be
careful
at
this
season
of
the
year
it
was
proper
to
take
something
to
keep
the
damp
out;
he
had
a
little
cough
already
(here
he
coughed
in
attestation
of
the
fact);
something
of
this
sort
(lifting
the
black
bottle)
was
excellent,
taken
medicinally
(he
poured
the
physic
into
his
tumbler);
he
didn't
make
a
practice
of
drinking
spirits
in
a
morning,
but
occasionally
it
really
was
prudent
to
take
precautions.
"Quite
prudent,
and
take
them
by
all
means,"
urged
the
host.
Mr.
Sykes
now
addressed
Mr.
Helstone,
who
stood
on
the
hearth,
his
shovel
hat
on
his
head,
watching
him
significantly
with
his
little,
keen
eyes.
"You,
sir,
as
a
clergyman,"
said
he,
"may
feel
it
disagreeable
to
be
present
amidst
scenes
of
hurry
and
flurry,
and,
I
may
say,
peril.
I
dare
say
your
nerves
won't
stand
it.
You're
a
man
of
peace,
sir;
but
we
manufacturers,
living
in
the
world,
and
always
in
turmoil,
get
quite
belligerent.
Really,
there's
an
ardour
excited
by
the
thoughts
of
danger
that
makes
my
heart
pant.
When
Mrs.
Sykes
is
afraid
of
the
house
being
attacked
and
broke
open
as
she
is
every
night
I
get
quite
excited.
I
couldn't
describe
to
you,
sir,
my
feelings.
Really,
if
anybody
was
to
come
thieves
or
anything
I
believe
I
should
enjoy
it,
such
is
my
spirit."
The
hardest
of
laughs,
though
brief
and
low,
and
by
no
means
insulting,
was
the
response
of
the
rector.
Moore
would
have
pressed
upon
the
heroic
mill
owner
a
third
tumbler,
but
the
clergyman,
who
never
transgressed,
nor
would
suffer
others
in
his
presence
to
transgress,
the
bounds
of
decorum,
checked
him.
"Enough
is
as
good
as
a
feast,
is
it
not,
Mr.
Sykes?"
he
said;
and
Mr.
Sykes
assented,
and
then
sat
and
watched
Joe
Scott
remove
the
bottle
at
a
sign
from
Helstone,
with
a
self
satisfied
simper
on
his
lips
and
a
regretful
glisten
in
his
eye.
Moore
looked
as
if
he
should
have
liked
to
fool
him
to
the
top
of
his
bent.
What
would
a
certain
young
kinswoman
of
his
have
said
could
she
have
seen
her
dear,
good,
great
Robert
her
Coriolanus
just
now?
Would
she
have
acknowledged
in
that
mischievous,
sardonic
visage
the
same
face
to
which
she
had
looked
up
with
such
love,
which
had
bent
over
her
with
such
gentleness
last
night?
Was
that
the
man
who
had
spent
so
quiet
an
evening
with
his
sister
and
his
cousin
so
suave
to
one,
so
tender
to
the
other
reading
Shakespeare
and
listening
to
Chenier?
Yes,
it
was
the
same
man,
only
seen
on
a
different
side
a
side
Caroline
had
not
yet
fairly
beheld,
though
perhaps
she
had
enough
sagacity
faintly
to
suspect
its
existence.
Well,
Caroline
had,
doubtless,
her
defective
side
too.
She
was
human.
She
must,
then,
have
been
very
imperfect;
and
had
she
seen
Moore
on
his
very
worst
side,
she
would
probably
have
said
this
to
herself
and
excused
him.
Love
can
excuse
anything
except
meanness;
but
meanness
kills
love,
cripples
even
natural
affection;
without
esteem
true
love
cannot
exist.
Moore,
with
all
his
faults,
might
be
esteemed;
for
he
had
no
moral
scrofula
in
his
mind,
no
hopeless
polluting
taint
such,
for
instance,
as
that
of
falsehood;
neither
was
he
the
slave
of
his
appetites.
The
active
life
to
which
he
had
been
born
and
bred
had
given
him
something
else
to
do
than
to
join
the
futile
chase
of
the
pleasure
hunter.
He
was
a
man
undegraded,
the
disciple
of
reason,
not
the
votary
of
sense.
The
same
might
be
said
of
old
Helstone.
Neither
of
these
two
would
look,
think,
or
speak
a
lie;
for
neither
of
them
had
the
wretched
black
bottle,
which
had
just
been
put
away,
any
charms.
Both
might
boast
a
valid
claim
to
the
proud
title
of
"lord
of
the
creation,"
for
no
animal
vice
was
lord
of
them;
they
looked
and
were
superior
beings
to
poor
Sykes.
A
sort
of
gathering
and
trampling
sound
was
heard
in
the
yard,
and
then
a
pause.
Moore
walked
to
the
window;
Helstone
followed.
Both
stood
on
one
side,
the
tall
junior
behind
the
under
sized
senior,
looking
forth
carefully,
so
that
they
might
not
be
visible
from
without.
Their
sole
comment
on
what
they
saw
was
a
cynical
smile
flashed
into
each
other's
stern
eyes.
A
flourishing
oratorical
cough
was
now
heard,
followed
by
the
interjection
"Whisht!"
designed,
as
it
seemed,
to
still
the
hum
of
several
voices.
Moore
opened
his
casement
an
inch
or
two
to
admit
sound
more
freely.
"Joseph
Scott,"
began
a
snuffling
voice
Scott
was
standing
sentinel
at
the
counting
house
door
"might
we
inquire
if
your
master
be
within,
and
is
to
be
spoken
to?"
"He's
within,
ay,"
said
Joe
nonchalantly.
"Would
you
then,
if
you
please"
(emphasis
on
"you"),
"have
the
goodness
to
tell
him
that
twelve
gentlemen
wants
to
see
him."
"He'd
happen
ax
what
for,"
suggested
Joe.
"I
mught
as
weel
tell
him
that
at
t'
same
time."
"For
a
purpose,"
was
the
answer.
Joe
entered.
"Please,
sir,
there's
twelve
gentlemen
wants
to
see
ye,
'for
a
purpose.'"
"Good,
Joe;
I'm
their
man.
Sugden,
come
when
I
whistle."
Moore
went
out,
chuckling
dryly.
He
advanced
into
the
yard,
one
hand
in
his
pocket,
the
other
in
his
waistcoat,
his
cap
brim
over
his
eyes,
shading
in
some
measure
their
deep
dancing
ray
of
scorn.
Twelve
men
waited
