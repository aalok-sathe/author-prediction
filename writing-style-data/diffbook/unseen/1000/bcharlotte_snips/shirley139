find
little
worthy
of
your
sympathies
in
the
ordinary
world.
The
ordinary
world
every
day
honest
folks
are
better
than
you
think
them,
much
better
than
any
bookish,
romancing
chit
of
a
girl
can
be
who
hardly
ever
puts
her
nose
over
her
uncle
the
parson's
garden
wall."
"Consequently
of
whom
you
know
nothing.
Excuse
me
indeed,
it
does
not
matter
whether
you
excuse
me
or
not
you
have
attacked
me
without
provocation;
I
shall
defend
myself
without
apology.
Of
my
relations
with
my
two
cousins
you
are
ignorant.
In
a
fit
of
ill
humour
you
have
attempted
to
poison
them
by
gratuitous
insinuations,
which
are
far
more
crafty
and
false
than
anything
with
which
you
can
justly
charge
me.
That
I
happen
to
be
pale,
and
sometimes
to
look
diffident,
is
no
business
of
yours;
that
I
am
fond
of
books,
and
indisposed
for
common
gossip,
is
still
less
your
business;
that
I
am
a
'romancing
chit
of
a
girl'
is
a
mere
conjecture
on
your
part.
I
never
romanced
to
you
nor
to
anybody
you
know.
That
I
am
the
parson's
niece
is
not
a
crime,
though
you
may
be
narrow
minded
enough
to
think
it
so.
You
dislike
me.
You
have
no
just
reason
for
disliking
me;
therefore
keep
the
expression
of
your
aversion
to
yourself.
If
at
any
time
in
future
you
evince
it
annoyingly,
I
shall
answer
even
less
scrupulously
than
I
have
done
now."
She
ceased,
and
sat
in
white
and
still
excitement.
She
had
spoken
in
the
clearest
of
tones,
neither
fast
nor
loud;
but
her
silver
accents
thrilled
the
ear.
The
speed
of
the
current
in
her
veins
was
just
then
as
swift
as
it
was
viewless.
Mrs.
Yorke
was
not
irritated
at
the
reproof,
worded
with
a
severity
so
simple,
dictated
by
a
pride
so
quiet.
Turning
coolly
to
Miss
Moore,
she
said,
nodding
her
cap
approvingly,
"She
has
spirit
in
her,
after
all.
Always
speak
as
honestly
as
you
have
done
just
now,"
she
continued,
"and
you'll
do."
"I
repel
a
recommendation
so
offensive,"
was
the
answer,
delivered
in
the
same
pure
key,
with
the
same
clear
look.
"I
reject
counsel
poisoned
by
insinuation.
It
is
my
right
to
speak
as
I
think
proper;
nothing
binds
me
to
converse
as
you
dictate.
So
far
from
always
speaking
as
I
have
done
just
now,
I
shall
never
address
any
one
in
a
tone
so
stern
or
in
language
so
harsh,
unless
in
answer
to
unprovoked
insult."
"Mother,
you
have
found
your
match,"
pronounced
little
Jessie,
whom
the
scene
appeared
greatly
to
edify.
Rose
had
heard
the
whole
with
an
unmoved
face.
She
now
said,
"No;
Miss
Helstone
is
not
my
mother's
match,
for
she
allows
herself
to
be
vexed.
My
mother
would
wear
her
out
in
a
few
weeks.
Shirley
Keeldar
manages
better.
Mother,
you
have
never
hurt
Miss
Keeldar's
feelings
yet.
She
wears
armour
under
her
silk
dress
that
you
cannot
penetrate."
Mrs.
Yorke
often
complained
that
her
children
were
mutinous.
It
was
strange
that
with
all
her
strictness,
with
all
her
"strong
mindedness,"
she
could
gain
no
command
over
them.
A
look
from
their
father
had
more
influence
with
them
than
a
lecture
from
her.
Miss
Moore
to
whom
the
position
of
witness
to
an
altercation
in
which
she
took
no
part
was
highly
displeasing,
as
being
an
unimportant
secondary
post
now
rallying
her
dignity,
prepared
to
utter
a
discourse
which
was
to
prove
both
parties
in
the
wrong,
and
to
make
it
clear
to
each
disputant
that
she
had
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
herself,
and
ought
to
submit
humbly
to
the
superior
sense
of
the
individual
then
addressing
her.
Fortunately
for
her
audience,
she
had
not
harangued
above
ten
minutes
when
Sarah's
entrance
with
the
tea
tray
called
her
attention,
first
to
the
fact
of
that
damsel
having
a
gilt
comb
in
her
hair
and
a
red
necklace
round
her
throat,
and
secondly,
and
subsequently
to
a
pointed
remonstrance,
to
the
duty
of
making
tea.
After
the
meal
Rose
restored
her
to
good
humour
by
bringing
her
guitar
and
asking
for
a
song,
and
afterwards
engaging
her
in
an
intelligent
and
sharp
cross
examination
about
guitar
playing
and
music
in
general.
Jessie,
meantime,
directed
her
assiduities
to
Caroline.
Sitting
on
a
stool
at
her
feet,
she
talked
to
her,
first
about
religion
and
then
about
politics.
Jessie
was
accustomed
at
home
to
drink
in
a
great
deal
of
what
her
father
said
on
these
subjects,
and
afterwards
in
company
to
retail,
with
more
wit
and
fluency
than
consistency
or
discretion,
his
opinions,
antipathies,
and
preferences.
She
rated
Caroline
soundly
for
being
a
member
of
the
Established
Church,
and
for
having
an
uncle
a
clergyman.
She
informed
her
that
she
lived
on
the
country,
and
ought
to
work
for
her
living
honestly,
instead
of
passing
a
useless
life,
and
eating
the
bread
of
idleness
in
the
shape
of
tithes.
Thence
Jessie
passed
to
a
review
of
the
ministry
at
that
time
in
office,
and
a
consideration
of
its
deserts.
She
made
familiar
mention
of
the
names
of
Lord
Castlereagh
and
Mr.
Perceval.
Each
of
these
personages
she
adorned
with
a
character
that
might
have
separately
suited
Moloch
and
Belial.
She
denounced
the
war
as
wholesale
murder,
and
Lord
Wellington
as
a
"hired
butcher."
Her
auditress
listened
with
exceeding
edification.
Jessie
had
something
of
the
genius
of
humour
in
her
nature.
It
was
inexpressibly
comic
to
hear
her
repeating
her
sire's
denunciations
in
his
nervous
northern
Doric;
as
hearty
a
little
Jacobin
as
ever
pent
a
free
mutinous
spirit
in
a
muslin
frock
and
sash.
Not
malignant
by
nature,
her
language
was
not
so
bitter
as
it
was
racy,
and
the
expressive
little
face
gave
a
piquancy
to
every
phrase
which
held
a
beholder's
interest
captive.
Caroline
chid
her
when
she
abused
Lord
Wellington;
but
she
listened
delighted
to
a
subsequent
tirade
against
the
Prince
Regent.
Jessie
quickly
read,
in
the
sparkle
of
her
hearer's
eye
and
the
laughter
