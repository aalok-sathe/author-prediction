her
sprang
Saturn,
Hyperion,
Oceanus;
she
bore
Prometheus
"
"Pagan
that
you
are!
what
does
that
signify?"
"I
say,
there
were
giants
on
the
earth
in
those
days
giants
that
strove
to
scale
heaven.
The
first
woman's
breast
that
heaved
with
life
on
this
world
yielded
the
daring
which
could
contend
with
Omnipotence,
the
strength
which
could
bear
a
thousand
years
of
bondage,
the
vitality
which
could
feed
that
vulture
death
through
uncounted
ages,
the
unexhausted
life
and
uncorrupted
excellence,
sisters
to
immortality,
which,
after
millenniums
of
crimes,
struggles,
and
woes,
could
conceive
and
bring
forth
a
Messiah.
The
first
woman
was
heaven
born.
Vast
was
the
heart
whence
gushed
the
well
spring
of
the
blood
of
nations,
and
grand
the
undegenerate
head
where
rested
the
consort
crown
of
creation."
"She
coveted
an
apple,
and
was
cheated
by
a
snake;
but
you
have
got
such
a
hash
of
Scripture
and
mythology
into
your
head
that
there
is
no
making
any
sense
of
you.
You
have
not
yet
told
me
what
you
saw
kneeling
on
those
hills."
"I
saw
I
now
see
a
woman
Titan.
Her
robe
of
blue
air
spreads
to
the
outskirts
of
the
heath,
where
yonder
flock
is
grazing;
a
veil
white
as
an
avalanche
sweeps
from
her
head
to
her
feet,
and
arabesques
of
lightning
flame
on
its
borders.
Under
her
breast
I
see
her
zone,
purple
like
that
horizon;
through
its
blush
shines
the
star
of
evening.
Her
steady
eyes
I
cannot
picture.
They
are
clear,
they
are
deep
as
lakes,
they
are
lifted
and
full
of
worship,
they
tremble
with
the
softness
of
love
and
the
lustre
of
prayer.
Her
forehead
has
the
expanse
of
a
cloud,
and
is
paler
than
the
early
moon,
risen
long
before
dark
gathers.
She
reclines
her
bosom
on
the
ridge
of
Stilbro'
Moor;
her
mighty
hands
are
joined
beneath
it.
So
kneeling,
face
to
face
she
speaks
with
God.
That
Eve
is
Jehovah's
daughter,
as
Adam
was
His
son."
"She
is
very
vague
and
visionary.
Come,
Shirley,
we
ought
to
go
into
church."
"Caroline,
I
will
not;
I
will
stay
out
here
with
my
mother
Eve,
in
these
days
called
Nature.
I
love
her
undying,
mighty
being!
Heaven
may
have
faded
from
her
brow
when
she
fell
in
paradise,
but
all
that
is
glorious
on
earth
shines
there
still.
She
is
taking
me
to
her
bosom,
and
showing
me
her
heart.
Hush,
Caroline!
You
will
see
her
and
feel
as
I
do,
if
we
are
both
silent."
"I
will
humour
your
whim;
but
you
will
begin
talking
again
ere
ten
minutes
are
over."
Miss
Keeldar,
on
whom
the
soft
excitement
of
the
warm
summer
evening
seemed
working
with
unwonted
power,
leaned
against
an
upright
headstone;
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
deep
burning
west,
and
sank
into
a
pleasurable
trance.
Caroline,
going
a
little
apart,
paced
to
and
fro
beneath
the
rectory
garden
wall,
dreaming
too
in
her
way.
Shirley
had
mentioned
the
word
"mother."
That
word
suggested
to
Caroline's
imagination
not
the
mighty
and
mystical
parent
of
Shirley's
visions,
but
a
gentle
human
form
the
form
she
ascribed
to
her
own
mother,
unknown,
unloved,
but
not
unlonged
for.
"Oh
that
the
day
would
come
when
she
would
remember
her
child!
Oh
that
I
might
know
her,
and
knowing,
love
her!"
Such
was
her
aspiration.
The
longing
of
her
childhood
filled
her
soul
again.
The
desire
which
many
a
night
had
kept
her
awake
in
her
crib,
and
which
fear
of
its
fallacy
had
of
late
years
almost
extinguished,
relit
suddenly,
and
glowed
warm
in
her
heart,
that
her
mother
might
come
some
happy
day,
and
send
for
her
to
her
presence,
look
upon
her
fondly
with
loving
eyes,
and
say
to
her
tenderly,
in
a
sweet
voice,
"Caroline,
my
child,
I
have
a
home
for
you;
you
shall
live
with
me.
All
the
love
you
have
needed,
and
not
tasted,
from
infancy,
I
have
saved
for
you
carefully.
Come;
it
shall
cherish
you
now."
A
noise
on
the
road
roused
Caroline
from
her
filial
hopes,
and
Shirley
from
her
Titan
visions.
They
listened,
and
heard
the
tramp
of
horses.
They
looked,
and
saw
a
glitter
through
the
trees.
They
caught
through
the
foliage
glimpses
of
martial
scarlet;
helm
shone,
plume
waved.
Silent
and
orderly,
six
soldiers
rode
softly
by.
"The
same
we
saw
this
afternoon,"
whispered
Shirley.
"They
have
been
halting
somewhere
till
now.
They
wish
to
be
as
little
noticed
as
possible,
and
are
seeking
their
rendezvous
at
this
quiet
hour,
while
the
people
are
at
church.
Did
I
not
say
we
should
see
unusual
things
ere
long?"
Scarcely
were
sight
and
sound
of
the
soldiers
lost,
when
another
and
somewhat
different
disturbance
broke
the
night
hush
a
child's
impatient
scream.
They
looked.
A
man
issued
from
the
church,
carrying
in
his
arms
an
infant
a
robust,
ruddy
little
boy
of
some
two
years
old
roaring
with
all
the
power
of
his
lungs.
He
had
probably
just
awaked
from
a
church
sleep.
Two
little
girls,
of
nine
and
ten,
followed.
The
influence
of
the
fresh
air,
and
the
attraction
of
some
flowers
gathered
from
a
grave,
soon
quieted
the
child.
The
man
sat
down
with
him,
dandling
him
on
his
knee
as
tenderly
as
any
woman;
the
two
little
girls
took
their
places
one
on
each
side.
"Good
evening,
William,"
said
Shirley,
after
due
scrutiny
of
the
man.
He
had
seen
her
before,
and
apparently
was
waiting
to
be
recognized.
He
now
took
off
his
hat,
and
grinned
a
smile
of
pleasure.
He
was
a
rough
headed,
hard
featured
personage,
not
old,
but
very
weather
beaten.
His
attire
was
decent
and
clean;
that
of
his
children
singularly
neat.
It
was
our
old
friend
Farren.
The
young
ladies
approached
him.
"You
are
not
going
into
the
church?"
he
inquired,
gazing
at
them
complacently,
yet
with
a
mixture
of
bashfulness
in
his
look
a
sentiment
not
by
any
means
the
result
of
awe
of
their
station,
but
only
of
