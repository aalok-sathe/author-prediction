trio;
small
English
features
they
all
possess;
all
own
a
blended
resemblance
to
sire
and
mother;
and
yet
a
distinctive
physiognomy,
mark
of
a
separate
character,
belongs
to
each.
I
shall
not
say
much
about
Matthew,
the
first
born
of
the
house,
though
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
gazing
at
him
long,
and
conjecturing
what
qualities
that
visage
hides
or
indicates.
He
is
no
plain
looking
boy:
that
jet
black
hair,
white
brow,
high
coloured
cheek,
those
quick,
dark
eyes,
are
good
points
in
their
way.
How
is
it
that,
look
as
long
as
you
will,
there
is
but
one
object
in
the
room,
and
that
the
most
sinister,
to
which
Matthew's
face
seems
to
bear
an
affinity,
and
of
which,
ever
and
anon,
it
reminds
you
strangely
the
eruption
of
Vesuvius?
Flame
and
shadow
seem
the
component
parts
of
that
lad's
soul
no
daylight
in
it,
and
no
sunshine,
and
no
pure,
cool
moonbeam
ever
shone
there.
He
has
an
English
frame,
but,
apparently,
not
an
English
mind
you
would
say,
an
Italian
stiletto
in
a
sheath
of
British
workmanship.
He
is
crossed
in
the
game
look
at
his
scowl.
Mr.
Yorke
sees
it,
and
what
does
he
say?
In
a
low
voice
he
pleads,
"Mark
and
Martin,
don't
anger
your
brother."
And
this
is
ever
the
tone
adopted
by
both
parents.
Theoretically,
they
decry
partiality
no
rights
of
primogeniture
are
to
be
allowed
in
that
house;
but
Matthew
is
never
to
be
vexed,
never
to
be
opposed;
they
avert
provocation
from
him
as
assiduously
as
they
would
avert
fire
from
a
barrel
of
gunpowder.
"Concede,
conciliate,"
is
their
motto
wherever
he
is
concerned.
The
republicans
are
fast
making
a
tyrant
of
their
own
flesh
and
blood.
This
the
younger
scions
know
and
feel,
and
at
heart
they
all
rebel
against
the
injustice.
They
cannot
read
their
parents'
motives;
they
only
see
the
difference
of
treatment.
The
dragon's
teeth
are
already
sown
amongst
Mr.
Yorke's
young
olive
branches;
discord
will
one
day
be
the
harvest.
Mark
is
a
bonny
looking
boy,
the
most
regular
featured
of
the
family.
He
is
exceedingly
calm;
his
smile
is
shrewd;
he
can
say
the
driest,
most
cutting
things
in
the
quietest
of
tones.
Despite
his
tranquillity,
a
somewhat
heavy
brow
speaks
temper,
and
reminds
you
that
the
smoothest
waters
are
not
always
the
safest.
Besides,
he
is
too
still,
unmoved,
phlegmatic,
to
be
happy.
Life
will
never
have
much
joy
in
it
for
Mark.
By
the
time
he
is
five
and
twenty
he
will
wonder
why
people
ever
laugh,
and
think
all
fools
who
seem
merry.
Poetry
will
not
exist
for
Mark,
either
in
literature
or
in
life;
its
best
effusions
will
sound
to
him
mere
rant
and
jargon.
Enthusiasm
will
be
his
aversion
and
contempt.
Mark
will
have
no
youth;
while
he
looks
juvenile
and
blooming,
he
will
be
already
middle
aged
in
mind.
His
body
is
now
fourteen
years
of
age,
but
his
soul
is
already
thirty.
Martin,
the
youngest
of
the
three,
owns
another
nature.
Life
may,
or
may
not,
be
brief
for
him,
but
it
will
certainly
be
brilliant.
He
will
pass
through
all
its
illusions,
half
believe
in
them,
wholly
enjoy
them,
then
outlive
them.
That
boy
is
not
handsome
not
so
handsome
as
either
of
his
brothers.
He
is
plain;
there
is
a
husk
upon
him,
a
dry
shell,
and
he
will
wear
it
till
he
is
near
twenty,
then
he
will
put
it
off.
About
that
period
he
will
make
himself
handsome.
He
will
wear
uncouth
manners
till
that
age,
perhaps
homely
garments;
but
the
chrysalis
will
retain
the
power
of
transfiguring
itself
into
the
butterfly,
and
such
transfiguration
will,
in
due
season,
take
place.
For
a
space
he
will
be
vain,
probably
a
downright
puppy,
eager
for
pleasure
and
desirous
of
admiration,
athirst,
too,
for
knowledge.
He
will
want
all
that
the
world
can
give
him,
both
of
enjoyment
and
lore;
he
will,
perhaps,
take
deep
draughts
at
each
fount.
That
thirst
satisfied,
what
next?
I
know
not.
Martin
might
be
a
remarkable
man.
Whether
he
will
or
not,
the
seer
is
powerless
to
predict:
on
that
subject
there
has
been
no
open
vision.
Take
Mr.
Yorke's
family
in
the
aggregate:
there
is
as
much
mental
power
in
those
six
young
heads,
as
much
originality,
as
much
activity
and
vigour
of
brain,
as
divided
amongst
half
a
dozen
commonplace
broods
would
give
to
each
rather
more
than
an
average
amount
of
sense
and
capacity.
Mr.
Yorke
knows
this,
and
is
proud
of
his
race.
Yorkshire
has
such
families
here
and
there
amongst
her
hills
and
wolds
peculiar,
racy,
vigorous;
of
good
blood
and
strong
brain;
turbulent
somewhat
in
the
pride
of
their
strength,
and
intractable
in
the
force
of
their
native
powers;
wanting
polish,
wanting
consideration,
wanting
docility,
but
sound,
spirited,
and
true
bred
as
the
eagle
on
the
cliff
or
the
steed
in
the
steppe.
A
low
tap
is
heard
at
the
parlour
door;
the
boys
have
been
making
such
a
noise
over
their
game,
and
little
Jessy,
besides,
has
been
singing
so
sweet
a
Scotch
song
to
her
father
who
delights
in
Scotch
and
Italian
songs,
and
has
taught
his
musical
little
daughter
some
of
the
best
that
the
ring
at
the
outer
door
was
not
observed.
"Come
in,"
says
Mrs.
Yorke,
in
that
conscientiously
constrained
and
solemnized
voice
of
hers,
which
ever
modulates
itself
to
a
funereal
dreariness
of
tone,
though
the
subject
it
is
exercised
upon
be
but
to
give
orders
for
the
making
of
a
pudding
in
the
kitchen,
to
bid
the
boys
hang
up
their
caps
in
the
hall,
or
to
call
the
girls
to
their
sewing
"come
in!"
And
in
came
Robert
Moore.
Moore's
habitual
gravity,
as
well
as
his
abstemiousness
(for
the
case
of
spirit
decanters
is
never
ordered
up
when
he
pays
an
evening
visit),
has
so
far
recommended
him
to
Mrs.
Yorke
that
she
has
not
yet
made
him
the
subject
of
private
animadversions
with
