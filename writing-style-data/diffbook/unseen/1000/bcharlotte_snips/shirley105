score
supplying
hot
water,
brought
from
the
coppers
of
the
rector's
kitchen.
The
profusion
of
flowers
and
evergreens
decorating
the
white
walls,
the
show
of
silver
teapots
and
bright
porcelain
on
the
tables,
the
active
figures,
blithe
faces,
gay
dresses
flitting
about
everywhere,
formed
altogether
a
refreshing
and
lively
spectacle.
Everybody
talked,
not
very
loudly,
but
merrily,
and
the
canary
birds
sang
shrill
in
their
high
hung
cages.
Caroline,
as
the
rector's
niece,
took
her
place
at
one
of
the
three
first
tables;
Mrs.
Boultby
and
Margaret
Hall
officiated
at
the
others.
At
these
tables
the
elite
of
the
company
were
to
be
entertained,
strict
rules
of
equality
not
being
more
in
fashion
at
Briarfield
than
elsewhere.
Miss
Helstone
removed
her
bonnet
and
scarf,
that
she
might
be
less
oppressed
with
the
heat.
Her
long
curls,
falling
on
her
neck,
served
almost
in
place
of
a
veil;
and
for
the
rest,
her
muslin
dress
was
fashioned
modestly
as
a
nun's
robe,
enabling
her
thus
to
dispense
with
the
encumbrance
of
a
shawl.
The
room
was
filling.
Mr.
Hall
had
taken
his
post
beside
Caroline,
who
now,
as
she
rearranged
the
cups
and
spoons
before
her,
whispered
to
him
in
a
low
voice
remarks
on
the
events
of
the
day.
He
looked
a
little
grave
about
what
had
taken
place
in
Royd
Lane,
and
she
tried
to
smile
him
out
of
his
seriousness.
Miss
Keeldar
sat
near
for
a
wonder,
neither
laughing
nor
talking;
on
the
contrary,
very
still,
and
gazing
round
her
vigilantly.
She
seemed
afraid
lest
some
intruder
should
take
a
seat
she
apparently
wished
to
reserve
next
her
own.
Ever
and
anon
she
spread
her
satin
dress
over
an
undue
portion
of
the
bench,
or
laid
her
gloves
or
her
embroidered
handkerchief
upon
it.
Caroline
noticed
this
manege
at
last,
and
asked
her
what
friend
she
expected.
Shirley
bent
towards
her,
almost
touched
her
ear
with
her
rosy
lips,
and
whispered
with
a
musical
softness
that
often
characterized
her
tones
when
what
she
said
tended
even
remotely
to
stir
some
sweet
secret
source
of
feeling
in
her
heart,
"I
expect
Mr.
Moore.
I
saw
him
last
night,
and
I
made
him
promise
to
come
with
his
sister,
and
to
sit
at
our
table.
He
won't
fail
me,
I
feel
certain;
but
I
apprehend
his
coming
too
late,
and
being
separated
from
us.
Here
is
a
fresh
batch
arriving;
every
place
will
be
taken.
Provoking!"
In
fact,
Mr.
Wynne
the
magistrate,
his
wife,
his
son,
and
his
two
daughters
now
entered
in
high
state.
They
were
Briarfield
gentry.
Of
course
their
place
was
at
the
first
table,
and
being
conducted
thither,
they
filled
up
the
whole
remaining
space.
For
Miss
Keeldar's
comfort,
Mr.
Sam
Wynne
inducted
himself
into
the
very
vacancy
she
had
kept
for
Moore,
planting
himself
solidly
on
her
gown,
her
gloves,
and
her
handkerchief.
Mr.
Sam
was
one
of
the
objects
of
her
aversion,
and
the
more
so
because
he
showed
serious
symptoms
of
an
aim
at
her
hand.
The
old
gentleman,
too,
had
publicly
declared
that
the
Fieldhead
estate
and
the
De
Walden
estate
were
delightfully
contagious
a
malapropism
which
rumour
had
not
failed
to
repeat
to
Shirley.
Caroline's
ears
yet
rung
with
that
thrilling
whisper,
"I
expect
Mr.
Moore,"
her
heart
yet
beat
and
her
cheek
yet
glowed
with
it,
when
a
note
from
the
organ
pealed
above
the
confused
hum
of
the
place.
Dr.
Boultby,
Mr.
Helstone,
and
Mr.
Hall
rose,
so
did
all
present,
and
grace
was
sung
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
music;
and
then
tea
began.
She
was
kept
too
busy
with
her
office
for
a
while
to
have
leisure
for
looking
round,
but
the
last
cup
being
filled,
she
threw
a
restless
glance
over
the
room.
There
were
some
ladies
and
several
gentlemen
standing
about
yet
unaccommodated
with
seats.
Amidst
a
group
she
recognized
her
spinster
friend,
Miss
Mann,
whom
the
fine
weather
had
tempted,
or
some
urgent
friend
had
persuaded,
to
leave
her
drear
solitude
for
one
hour
of
social
enjoyment.
Miss
Mann
looked
tired
of
standing;
a
lady
in
a
yellow
bonnet
brought
her
a
chair.
Caroline
knew
well
that
chapeau
en
satin
jaune;
she
knew
the
black
hair,
and
the
kindly
though
rather
opinionated
and
froward
looking
face
under
it;
she
knew
that
robe
de
soie
noire,
she
knew
even
that
schall
gris
de
lin;
she
knew,
in
short,
Hortense
Moore,
and
she
wanted
to
jump
up
and
run
to
her
and
kiss
her
to
give
her
one
embrace
for
her
own
sake
and
two
for
her
brother's.
She
half
rose,
indeed,
with
a
smothered
exclamation,
and
perhaps
for
the
impulse
was
very
strong
she
would
have
run
across
the
room
and
actually
saluted
her;
but
a
hand
replaced
her
in
her
seat,
and
a
voice
behind
her
whispered,
"Wait
till
after
tea,
Lina,
and
then
I'll
bring
her
to
you."
And
when
she
could
look
up
she
did,
and
there
was
Robert
himself
close
behind,
smiling
at
her
eagerness,
looking
better
than
she
had
ever
seen
him
look
looking,
indeed,
to
her
partial
eyes,
so
very
handsome
that
she
dared
not
trust
herself
to
hazard
a
second
glance;
for
his
image
struck
on
her
vision
with
painful
brightness,
and
pictured
itself
on
her
memory
as
vividly
as
if
there
daguerreotyped
by
a
pencil
of
keen
lightning.
He
moved
on,
and
spoke
to
Miss
Keeldar.
Shirley,
irritated
by
some
unwelcome
attentions
from
Sam
Wynne,
and
by
the
fact
of
that
gentleman
being
still
seated
on
her
gloves
and
handkerchief
and
probably,
also,
by
Moore's
want
of
punctuality
was
by
no
means
in
good
humour.
She
first
shrugged
her
shoulders
at
him,
and
then
she
said
a
bitter
word
or
two
about
his
"insupportable
tardiness."
Moore
neither
apologized
nor
retorted.
He
stood
near
her
quietly,
as
if
waiting
to
see
whether
she
would
recover
her
temper;
which
she
did
in
little
more
than
three
minutes,
indicating
the
change
by
offering
him
her
hand.
Moore
took
it
with
