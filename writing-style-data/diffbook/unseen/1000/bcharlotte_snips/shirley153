history
not
from
herself,
but
from
others.
With
every
detail
of
Mr.
James
Helstone's
career
and
character
I
was
acquainted.
An
afternoon's
sitting
and
conversation
with
Miss
Mann
had
rendered
me
familiar
therewith;
also
he
is
one
of
Mrs.
Yorke's
warning
examples
one
of
the
blood
red
lights
she
hangs
out
to
scare
young
ladies
from
matrimony.
I
believe
I
should
have
been
sceptical
about
the
truth
of
the
portrait
traced
by
such
fingers
both
these
ladies
take
a
dark
pleasure
in
offering
to
view
the
dark
side
of
life
but
I
questioned
Mr.
Yorke
on
the
subject,
and
he
said,
'Shirley,
my
woman,
if
you
want
to
know
aught
about
yond'
James
Helstone,
I
can
only
say
he
was
a
man
tiger.
He
was
handsome,
dissolute,
soft,
treacherous,
courteous,
cruel
'
Don't
cry,
Cary;
we'll
say
no
more
about
it."
"I
am
not
crying,
Shirley;
or
if
I
am,
it
is
nothing.
Go
on;
you
are
no
friend
if
you
withhold
from
me
the
truth.
I
hate
that
false
plan
of
disguising,
mutilating
the
truth."
"Fortunately
I
have
said
pretty
nearly
all
that
I
have
to
say,
except
that
your
uncle
himself
confirmed
Mr.
Yorke's
words;
for
he
too
scorns
a
lie,
and
deals
in
none
of
those
conventional
subterfuges
that
are
shabbier
than
lies."
"But
papa
is
dead;
they
should
let
him
alone
now."
"They
should;
and
we
will
let
him
alone.
Cry
away,
Cary;
it
will
do
you
good.
It
is
wrong
to
check
natural
tears.
Besides,
I
choose
to
please
myself
by
sharing
an
idea
that
at
this
moment
beams
in
your
mother's
eye
while
she
looks
at
you.
Every
drop
blots
out
a
sin.
Weep!
your
tears
have
the
virtue
which
the
rivers
of
Damascus
lacked.
Like
Jordan,
they
can
cleanse
a
leprous
memory."
"Madam,"
she
continued,
addressing
Mrs.
Pryor,
"did
you
think
I
could
be
daily
in
the
habit
of
seeing
you
and
your
daughter
together
marking
your
marvellous
similarity
in
many
points,
observing
(pardon
me)
your
irrepressible
emotions
in
the
presence
and
still
more
in
the
absence
of
your
child
and
not
form
my
own
conjectures?
I
formed
them,
and
they
are
literally
correct.
I
shall
begin
to
think
myself
shrewd."
"And
you
said
nothing?"
observed
Caroline,
who
soon
regained
the
quiet
control
of
her
feelings.
"Nothing.
I
had
no
warrant
to
breathe
a
word
on
the
subject.
My
business
it
was
not;
I
abstained
from
making
it
such."
"You
guessed
so
deep
a
secret,
and
did
not
hint
that
you
guessed
it?"
"Is
that
so
difficult?"
"It
is
not
like
you."
"How
do
you
know?"
"You
are
not
reserved;
you
are
frankly
communicative."
"I
may
be
communicative,
yet
know
where
to
stop.
In
showing
my
treasure
I
may
withhold
a
gem
or
two
a
curious,
unbought
graven
stone
an
amulet
of
whose
mystic
glitter
I
rarely
permit
even
myself
a
glimpse.
Good
day."
Caroline
thus
seemed
to
get
a
view
of
Shirley's
character
under
a
novel
aspect.
Ere
long
the
prospect
was
renewed;
it
opened
upon
her.
No
sooner
had
she
regained
sufficient
strength
to
bear
a
change
of
scene
the
excitement
of
a
little
society
than
Miss
Keeldar
sued
daily
for
her
presence
at
Fieldhead.
Whether
Shirley
had
become
wearied
of
her
honoured
relatives
is
not
known.
She
did
not
say
she
was;
but
she
claimed
and
retained
Caroline
with
an
eagerness
which
proved
that
an
addition
to
that
worshipful
company
was
not
unwelcome.
The
Sympsons
were
church
people.
Of
course
the
rector's
niece
was
received
by
them
with
courtesy.
Mr.
Sympson
proved
to
be
a
man
of
spotless
respectability,
worrying
temper,
pious
principles,
and
worldly
views;
his
lady
was
a
very
good
woman
patient,
kind,
well
bred.
She
had
been
brought
up
on
a
narrow
system
of
views,
starved
on
a
few
prejudices
a
mere
handful
of
bitter
herbs;
a
few
preferences,
soaked
till
their
natural
flavour
was
extracted,
and
with
no
seasoning
added
in
the
cooking;
some
excellent
principles,
made
up
in
a
stiff
raised
crust
of
bigotry
difficult
to
digest.
Far
too
submissive
was
she
to
complain
of
this
diet
or
to
ask
for
a
crumb
beyond
it.
The
daughters
were
an
example
to
their
sex.
They
were
tall,
with
a
Roman
nose
apiece.
They
had
been
educated
faultlessly.
All
they
did
was
well
done.
History
and
the
most
solid
books
had
cultivated
their
minds.
Principles
and
opinions
they
possessed
which
could
not
be
mended.
More
exactly
regulated
lives,
feelings,
manners,
habits,
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
anywhere.
They
knew
by
heart
a
certain
young
ladies'
schoolroom
code
of
laws
on
language,
demeanour,
etc.;
themselves
never
deviated
from
its
curious
little
pragmatical
provisions,
and
they
regarded
with
secret
whispered
horror
all
deviations
in
others.
The
Abomination
of
Desolation
was
no
mystery
to
them;
they
had
discovered
that
unutterable
Thing
in
the
characteristic
others
call
Originality.
Quick
were
they
to
recognize
the
signs
of
this
evil;
and
wherever
they
saw
its
trace
whether
in
look,
word,
or
deed;
whether
they
read
it
in
the
fresh,
vigorous
style
of
a
book,
or
listened
to
it
in
interesting,
unhackneyed,
pure,
expressive
language
they
shuddered,
they
recoiled.
Danger
was
above
their
heads,
peril
about
their
steps.
What
was
this
strange
thing?
Being
unintelligible
it
must
be
bad.
Let
it
be
denounced
and
chained
up.
Henry
Sympson,
the
only
son
and
youngest
child
of
the
family,
was
a
boy
of
fifteen.
He
generally
kept
with
his
tutor.
When
he
left
him,
he
sought
his
cousin
Shirley.
This
boy
differed
from
his
sisters.
He
was
little,
lame,
and
pale;
his
large
eyes
shone
somewhat
languidly
in
a
wan
orbit.
They
were,
indeed,
usually
rather
dim,
but
they
were
capable
of
illumination.
At
times
they
could
not
only
shine,
but
blaze.
Inward
emotion
could
likewise
give
colour
to
his
cheek
and
decision
to
his
crippled
movements.
Henry's
mother
loved
him;
she
thought
his
peculiarities
were
a
mark
of
election.
He
was
not
like
other
children,
she
allowed.
She
believed
him
regenerate
a
new
