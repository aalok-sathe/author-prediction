grand
folk
fro'
London
is
shocked
at
wer
'incivility;'
and
we
like
weel
enough
to
gi'e
'em
summat
to
be
shocked
at,
'cause
it's
sport
to
us
to
watch
'em
turn
up
the
whites
o'
their
een,
and
spreed
out
their
bits
o'
hands,
like
as
they're
flayed
wi'
bogards,
and
then
to
hear
'em
say,
nipping
off
their
words
short
like,
'Dear!
dear!
Whet
seveges!
How
very
corse!'"
"You
are
savages,
Joe.
You
don't
suppose
you're
civilized,
do
you?"
"Middling,
middling,
maister.
I
reckon
'at
us
manufacturing
lads
i'
th'
north
is
a
deal
more
intelligent,
and
knaws
a
deal
more
nor
th'
farming
folk
i'
th'
south.
Trade
sharpens
wer
wits;
and
them
that's
mechanics
like
me
is
forced
to
think.
Ye
know,
what
wi'
looking
after
machinery
and
sich
like,
I've
getten
into
that
way
that
when
I
see
an
effect,
I
look
straight
out
for
a
cause,
and
I
oft
lig
hold
on't
to
purpose;
and
then
I
like
reading,
and
I'm
curious
to
knaw
what
them
that
reckons
to
govern
us
aims
to
do
for
us
and
wi'
us.
And
there's
many
'cuter
nor
me;
there's
many
a
one
amang
them
greasy
chaps
'at
smells
o'
oil,
and
amang
them
dyers
wi'
blue
and
black
skins,
that
has
a
long
head,
and
that
can
tell
what
a
fooil
of
a
law
is,
as
well
as
ye
or
old
Yorke,
and
a
deal
better
nor
soft
uns
like
Christopher
Sykes
o'
Whinbury,
and
greet
hectoring
nowts
like
yond'
Irish
Peter,
Helstone's
curate."
"You
think
yourself
a
clever
fellow,
I
know,
Scott."
"Ay!
I'm
fairish.
I
can
tell
cheese
fro'
chalk,
and
I'm
varry
weel
aware
that
I've
improved
sich
opportunities
as
I
have
had,
a
deal
better
nor
some
'at
reckons
to
be
aboon
me;
but
there's
thousands
i'
Yorkshire
that's
as
good
as
me,
and
a
two
three
that's
better."
"You're
a
great
man
you're
a
sublime
fellow;
but
you're
a
prig,
a
conceited
noodle
with
it
all,
Joe!
You
need
not
to
think
that
because
you've
picked
up
a
little
knowledge
of
practical
mathematics,
and
because
you
have
found
some
scantling
of
the
elements
of
chemistry
at
the
bottom
of
a
dyeing
vat,
that
therefore
you're
a
neglected
man
of
science;
and
you
need
not
to
suppose
that
because
the
course
of
trade
does
not
always
run
smooth,
and
you,
and
such
as
you,
are
sometimes
short
of
work
and
of
bread,
that
therefore
your
class
are
martyrs,
and
that
the
whole
form
of
government
under
which
you
live
is
wrong.
And,
moreover,
you
need
not
for
a
moment
to
insinuate
that
the
virtues
have
taken
refuge
in
cottages
and
wholly
abandoned
slated
houses.
Let
me
tell
you,
I
particularly
abominate
that
sort
of
trash,
because
I
know
so
well
that
human
nature
is
human
nature
everywhere,
whether
under
tile
or
thatch,
and
that
in
every
specimen
of
human
nature
that
breathes,
vice
and
virtue
are
ever
found
blended,
in
smaller
or
greater
proportions,
and
that
the
proportion
is
not
determined
by
station.
I
have
seen
villains
who
were
rich,
and
I
have
seen
villains
who
were
poor,
and
I
have
seen
villains
who
were
neither
rich
nor
poor,
but
who
had
realized
Agar's
wish,
and
lived
in
fair
and
modest
competency.
The
clock
is
going
to
strike
six.
Away
with
you,
Joe,
and
ring
the
mill
bell."
It
was
now
the
middle
of
the
month
of
February;
by
six
o'clock
therefore
dawn
was
just
beginning
to
steal
on
night,
to
penetrate
with
a
pale
ray
its
brown
obscurity,
and
give
a
demi
translucence
to
its
opaque
shadows.
Pale
enough
that
ray
was
on
this
particular
morning:
no
colour
tinged
the
east,
no
flush
warmed
it.
To
see
what
a
heavy
lid
day
slowly
lifted,
what
a
wan
glance
she
flung
along
the
hills,
you
would
have
thought
the
sun's
fire
quenched
in
last
night's
floods.
The
breath
of
this
morning
was
chill
as
its
aspect;
a
raw
wind
stirred
the
mass
of
night
cloud,
and
showed,
as
it
slowly
rose,
leaving
a
colourless,
silver
gleaming
ring
all
round
the
horizon,
not
blue
sky,
but
a
stratum
of
paler
vapour
beyond.
It
had
ceased
to
rain,
but
the
earth
was
sodden,
and
the
pools
and
rivulets
were
full.
The
mill
windows
were
alight,
the
bell
still
rung
loud,
and
now
the
little
children
came
running
in,
in
too
great
a
hurry,
let
us
hope,
to
feel
very
much
nipped
by
the
inclement
air;
and
indeed,
by
contrast,
perhaps
the
morning
appeared
rather
favourable
to
them
than
otherwise,
for
they
had
often
come
to
their
work
that
winter
through
snow
storms,
through
heavy
rain,
through
hard
frost.
Mr.
Moore
stood
at
the
entrance
to
watch
them
pass.
He
counted
them
as
they
went
by.
To
those
who
came
rather
late
he
said
a
word
of
reprimand,
which
was
a
little
more
sharply
repeated
by
Joe
Scott
when
the
lingerers
reached
the
work
rooms.
Neither
master
nor
overlooker
spoke
savagely.
They
were
not
savage
men
either
of
them,
though
it
appeared
both
were
rigid,
for
they
fined
a
delinquent
who
came
considerably
too
late.
Mr.
Moore
made
him
pay
his
penny
down
ere
he
entered,
and
informed
him
that
the
next
repetition
of
the
fault
would
cost
him
twopence.
Rules,
no
doubt,
are
necessary
in
such
cases,
and
coarse
and
cruel
masters
will
make
coarse
and
cruel
rules,
which,
at
the
time
we
treat
of
at
least,
they
used
sometimes
to
enforce
tyrannically;
but
though
I
describe
imperfect
characters
(every
character
in
this
book
will
be
found
to
be
more
or
less
imperfect,
my
pen
refusing
to
draw
anything
in
the
model
line),
I
have
not
undertaken
to
handle
degraded
or
utterly
infamous
ones.
Child
torturers,
slave
masters
and
drivers,
I
consign
to
the
hands
of
jailers.
The
novelist
may
be
excused
from
sullying
his
page
with
the
record
of
their
deeds.
Instead,
then,
of
harrowing
up
my
reader's
soul
and
delighting
his
organ
of
wonder
