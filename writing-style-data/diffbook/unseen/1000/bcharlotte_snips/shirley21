with
effective
descriptions
of
stripes
and
scourgings,
I
am
happy
to
be
able
to
inform
him
that
neither
Mr.
Moore
nor
his
overlooker
ever
struck
a
child
in
their
mill.
Joe
had,
indeed,
once
very
severely
flogged
a
son
of
his
own
for
telling
a
lie
and
persisting
in
it;
but,
like
his
employer,
he
was
too
phlegmatic,
too
calm,
as
well
as
too
reasonable
a
man,
to
make
corporal
chastisement
other
than
the
exception
to
his
treatment
of
the
young.
Mr.
Moore
haunted
his
mill,
his
mill
yard,
his
dye
house,
and
his
warehouse
till
the
sickly
dawn
strengthened
into
day.
The
sun
even
rose
at
least
a
white
disc,
clear,
tintless,
and
almost
chill
looking
as
ice,
peeped
over
the
dark
crest
of
a
hill,
changed
to
silver
the
livid
edge
of
the
cloud
above
it,
and
looked
solemnly
down
the
whole
length
of
the
den,
or
narrow
dale,
to
whose
strait
bounds
we
are
at
present
limited.
It
was
eight
o'clock;
the
mill
lights
were
all
extinguished;
the
signal
was
given
for
breakfast;
the
children,
released
for
half
an
hour
from
toil,
betook
themselves
to
the
little
tin
cans
which
held
their
coffee,
and
to
the
small
baskets
which
contained
their
allowance
of
bread.
Let
us
hope
they
have
enough
to
eat;
it
would
be
a
pity
were
it
otherwise.
And
now
at
last
Mr.
Moore
quitted
the
mill
yard,
and
bent
his
steps
to
his
dwelling
house.
It
was
only
a
short
distance
from
the
factory,
but
the
hedge
and
high
bank
on
each
side
of
the
lane
which
conducted
to
it
seemed
to
give
it
something
of
the
appearance
and
feeling
of
seclusion.
It
was
a
small,
whitewashed
place,
with
a
green
porch
over
the
door;
scanty
brown
stalks
showed
in
the
garden
soil
near
this
porch,
and
likewise
beneath
the
windows
stalks
budless
and
flowerless
now,
but
giving
dim
prediction
of
trained
and
blooming
creepers
for
summer
days.
A
grass
plat
and
borders
fronted
the
cottage.
The
borders
presented
only
black
mould
yet,
except
where,
in
sheltered
nooks,
the
first
shoots
of
snowdrop
or
crocus
peeped,
green
as
emerald,
from
the
earth.
The
spring
was
late;
it
had
been
a
severe
and
prolonged
winter;
the
last
deep
snow
had
but
just
disappeared
before
yesterday's
rains;
on
the
hills,
indeed,
white
remnants
of
it
yet
gleamed,
flecking
the
hollows
and
crowning
the
peaks;
the
lawn
was
not
verdant,
but
bleached,
as
was
the
grass
on
the
bank,
and
under
the
hedge
in
the
lane.
Three
trees,
gracefully
grouped,
rose
beside
the
cottage.
They
were
not
lofty,
but
having
no
rivals
near,
they
looked
well
and
imposing
where
they
grew.
Such
was
Mr.
Moore's
home
a
snug
nest
for
content
and
contemplation,
but
one
within
which
the
wings
of
action
and
ambition
could
not
long
lie
folded.
Its
air
of
modest
comfort
seemed
to
possess
no
particular
attraction
for
its
owner.
Instead
of
entering
the
house
at
once
he
fetched
a
spade
from
a
little
shed
and
began
to
work
in
the
garden.
For
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
dug
on
uninterrupted.
At
length,
however,
a
window
opened,
and
a
female
voice
called
to
him,
"Eh,
bien!
Tu
ne
dejeunes
pas
ce
matin?"
The
answer,
and
the
rest
of
the
conversation,
was
in
French;
but
as
this
is
an
English
book,
I
shall
translate
it
into
English.
"Is
breakfast
ready,
Hortense?"
"Certainly;
it
has
been
ready
half
an
hour."
"Then
I
am
ready
too.
I
have
a
canine
hunger."
He
threw
down
his
spade,
and
entered
the
house.
The
narrow
passage
conducted
him
to
a
small
parlour,
where
a
breakfast
of
coffee
and
bread
and
butter,
with
the
somewhat
un
English
accompaniment
of
stewed
pears,
was
spread
on
the
table.
Over
these
viands
presided
the
lady
who
had
spoken
from
the
window.
I
must
describe
her
before
I
go
any
farther.
She
seemed
a
little
older
than
Mr.
Moore
perhaps
she
was
thirty
five,
tall,
and
proportionately
stout;
she
had
very
black
hair,
for
the
present
twisted
up
in
curl
papers,
a
high
colour
in
her
cheeks,
a
small
nose,
a
pair
of
little
black
eyes.
The
lower
part
of
her
face
was
large
in
proportion
to
the
upper;
her
forehead
was
small
and
rather
corrugated;
she
had
a
fretful
though
not
an
ill
natured
expression
of
countenance;
there
was
something
in
her
whole
appearance
one
felt
inclined
to
be
half
provoked
with
and
half
amused
at.
The
strangest
point
was
her
dress
a
stuff
petticoat
and
a
striped
cotton
camisole.
The
petticoat
was
short,
displaying
well
a
pair
of
feet
and
ankles
which
left
much
to
be
desired
in
the
article
of
symmetry.
You
will
think
I
have
depicted
a
remarkable
slattern,
reader.
Not
at
all.
Hortense
Moore
(she
was
Mr.
Moore's
sister)
was
a
very
orderly,
economical
person.
The
petticoat,
camisole,
and
curl
papers
were
her
morning
costume,
in
which,
of
forenoons,
she
had
always
been
accustomed
to
"go
her
household
ways"
in
her
own
country.
She
did
not
choose
to
adopt
English
fashions
because
she
was
obliged
to
live
in
England;
she
adhered
to
her
old
Belgian
modes,
quite
satisfied
that
there
was
a
merit
in
so
doing.
Mademoiselle
had
an
excellent
opinion
of
herself
an
opinion
not
wholly
undeserved,
for
she
possessed
some
good
and
sterling
qualities;
but
she
rather
over
estimated
the
kind
and
degree
of
these
qualities,
and
quite
left
out
of
the
account
sundry
little
defects
which
accompanied
them.
You
could
never
have
persuaded
her
that
she
was
a
prejudiced
and
narrow
minded
person,
that
she
was
too
susceptible
on
the
subject
of
her
own
dignity
and
importance,
and
too
apt
to
take
offence
about
trifles;
yet
all
this
was
true.
However,
where
her
claims
to
distinction
were
not
opposed,
and
where
her
prejudices
were
not
offended,
she
could
be
kind
and
friendly
enough.
To
her
two
brothers
(for
there
was
another
Gerard
Moore
besides
Robert)
she
was
very
much
attached.
As
the
sole
remaining
representatives
of
