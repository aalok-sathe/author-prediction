at
Stilbro',
and
one
and
all
went
home
in
such
a
plight
as
their
wives
would
never
wish
to
witness
more.
Liverpool
started
and
snorted
like
a
river
horse
roused
amongst
his
reeds
by
thunder.
Some
of
the
American
merchants
felt
threatenings
of
apoplexy,
and
had
themselves
bled
all,
like
wise
men,
at
this
first
moment
of
prosperity,
prepared
to
rush
into
the
bowels
of
speculation,
and
to
delve
new
difficulties,
in
whose
depths
they
might
lose
themselves
at
some
future
day.
Stocks
which
had
been
accumulating
for
years
now
went
off
in
a
moment,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye.
Warehouses
were
lightened,
ships
were
laden;
work
abounded,
wages
rose;
the
good
time
seemed
come.
These
prospects
might
be
delusive,
but
they
were
brilliant
to
some
they
were
even
true.
At
that
epoch,
in
that
single
month
of
June,
many
a
solid
fortune
was
realized.
When
a
whole
province
rejoices,
the
humblest
of
its
inhabitants
tastes
a
festal
feeling;
the
sound
of
public
bells
rouses
the
most
secluded
abode,
as
if
with
a
call
to
be
gay.
And
so
Caroline
Helstone
thought,
when
she
dressed
herself
more
carefully
than
usual
on
the
day
of
this
trading
triumph,
and
went,
attired
in
her
neatest
muslin,
to
spend
the
afternoon
at
Fieldhead,
there
to
superintend
certain
millinery
preparations
for
a
great
event,
the
last
appeal
in
these
matters
being
reserved
for
her
unimpeachable
taste.
She
decided
on
the
wreath,
the
veil,
the
dress
to
be
worn
at
the
altar.
She
chose
various
robes
and
fashions
for
more
ordinary
occasions,
without
much
reference
to
the
bride's
opinion
that
lady,
indeed,
being
in
a
somewhat
impracticable
mood.
Louis
had
presaged
difficulties,
and
he
had
found
them
in
fact,
his
mistress
had
shown
herself
exquisitely
provoking,
putting
off
her
marriage
day
by
day,
week
by
week,
month
by
month,
at
first
coaxing
him
with
soft
pretences
of
procrastination,
and
in
the
end
rousing
his
whole
deliberate
but
determined
nature
to
revolt
against
her
tyranny,
at
once
so
sweet
and
so
intolerable.
It
had
needed
a
sort
of
tempest
shock
to
bring
her
to
the
point;
but
there
she
was
at
last,
fettered
to
a
fixed
day.
There
she
lay,
conquered
by
love,
and
bound
with
a
vow.
Thus
vanquished
and
restricted,
she
pined,
like
any
other
chained
denizen
of
deserts.
Her
captor
alone
could
cheer
her;
his
society
only
could
make
amends
for
the
lost
privilege
of
liberty.
In
his
absence
she
sat
or
wandered
alone,
spoke
little,
and
ate
less.
She
furthered
no
preparations
for
her
nuptials;
Louis
was
himself
obliged
to
direct
all
arrangements.
He
was
virtually
master
of
Fieldhead
weeks
before
he
became
so
nominally
the
least
presumptuous,
the
kindest
master
that
ever
was,
but
with
his
lady
absolute.
She
abdicated
without
a
word
or
a
struggle.
"Go
to
Mr.
Moore,
ask
Mr.
Moore,"
was
her
answer
when
applied
to
for
orders.
Never
was
wooer
of
wealthy
bride
so
thoroughly
absolved
from
the
subaltern
part,
so
inevitably
compelled
to
assume
a
paramount
character.
In
all
this
Miss
Keeldar
partly
yielded
to
her
disposition;
but
a
remark
she
made
a
year
afterwards
proved
that
she
partly
also
acted
on
system.
"Louis,"
she
said,
"would
never
have
learned
to
rule
if
she
had
not
ceased
to
govern.
The
incapacity
of
the
sovereign
had
developed
the
powers
of
the
premier."
It
had
been
intended
that
Miss
Helstone
should
act
as
bridesmaid
at
the
approaching
nuptials,
but
Fortune
had
destined
her
another
part.
She
came
home
in
time
to
water
her
plants.
She
had
performed
this
little
task.
The
last
flower
attended
to
was
a
rose
tree,
which
bloomed
in
a
quiet
green
nook
at
the
back
of
the
house.
This
plant
had
received
the
refreshing
shower;
she
was
now
resting
a
minute.
Near
the
wall
stood
a
fragment
of
sculptured
stone
a
monkish
relic
once,
perhaps,
the
base
of
a
cross.
She
mounted
it,
that
she
might
better
command
the
view.
She
had
still
the
watering
pot
in
one
hand;
with
the
other
her
pretty
dress
was
held
lightly
aside,
to
avoid
trickling
drops.
She
gazed
over
the
wall,
along
some
lonely
fields;
beyond
three
dusk
trees,
rising
side
by
side
against
the
sky;
beyond
a
solitary
thorn
at
the
head
of
a
solitary
lane
far
off.
She
surveyed
the
dusk
moors,
where
bonfires
were
kindling.
The
summer
evening
was
warm;
the
bell
music
was
joyous;
the
blue
smoke
of
the
fires
looked
soft,
their
red
flame
bright.
Above
them,
in
the
sky
whence
the
sun
had
vanished,
twinkled
a
silver
point
the
star
of
love.
Caroline
was
not
unhappy
that
evening
far
otherwise;
but
as
she
gazed
she
sighed,
and
as
she
sighed
a
hand
circled
her,
and
rested
quietly
on
her
waist.
Caroline
thought
she
knew
who
had
drawn
near;
she
received
the
touch
unstartled.
"I
am
looking
at
Venus,
mamma.
See,
she
is
beautiful.
How
white
her
lustre
is,
compared
with
the
deep
red
of
the
bonfires!"
The
answer
was
a
closer
caress;
and
Caroline
turned,
and
looked,
not
into
Mrs.
Pryor's
matron
face,
but
up
at
a
dark
manly
visage.
She
dropped
her
watering
pot
and
stepped
down
from
the
pedestal.
"I
have
been
sitting
with
'mamma'
an
hour,"
said
the
intruder.
"I
have
had
a
long
conversation
with
her.
Where,
meantime,
have
you
been?"
"To
Fieldhead.
Shirley
is
as
naughty
as
ever,
Robert.
She
will
neither
say
Yes
nor
No
to
any
question
put.
She
sits
alone.
I
cannot
tell
whether
she
is
melancholy
or
nonchalant.
If
you
rouse
her
or
scold
her,
she
gives
you
a
look,
half
wistful,
half
reckless,
which
sends
you
away
as
queer
and
crazed
as
herself.
What
Louis
will
make
of
her,
I
cannot
tell.
For
my
part,
if
I
were
a
gentleman,
I
think
I
would
not
dare
undertake
her."
"Never
mind
them.
They
were
cut
out
for
each
other.
Louis,
strange
to
say,
likes
her
all
the
better
for
these
freaks.
He
will
manage
her,
if
any
one
can.
She
tries
