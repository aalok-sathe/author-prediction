him
well,
for
an
anxious
countenance
and
a
hollow,
somewhat
haggard,
outline
of
face
disturb
the
idea
of
beauty
with
one
of
care.
His
eyes
are
large,
and
grave,
and
gray;
their
expression
is
intent
and
meditative,
rather
searching
than
soft,
rather
thoughtful
than
genial.
When
he
parts
his
lips
in
a
smile,
his
physiognomy
is
agreeable
not
that
it
is
frank
or
cheerful
even
then,
but
you
feel
the
influence
of
a
certain
sedate
charm,
suggestive,
whether
truly
or
delusively,
of
a
considerate,
perhaps
a
kind
nature,
of
feelings
that
may
wear
well
at
home
patient,
forbearing,
possibly
faithful
feelings.
He
is
still
young
not
more
than
thirty;
his
stature
is
tall,
his
figure
slender.
His
manner
of
speaking
displeases.
He
has
an
outlandish
accent,
which,
notwithstanding
a
studied
carelessness
of
pronunciation
and
diction,
grates
on
a
British,
and
especially
on
a
Yorkshire,
ear.
Mr.
Moore,
indeed,
was
but
half
a
Briton,
and
scarcely
that.
He
came
of
a
foreign
ancestry
by
the
mother's
side,
and
was
himself
born
and
partly
reared
on
a
foreign
soil.
A
hybrid
in
nature,
it
is
probable
he
had
a
hybrid's
feeling
on
many
points
patriotism
for
one;
it
is
likely
that
he
was
unapt
to
attach
himself
to
parties,
to
sects,
even
to
climes
and
customs;
it
is
not
impossible
that
he
had
a
tendency
to
isolate
his
individual
person
from
any
community
amidst
which
his
lot
might
temporarily
happen
to
be
thrown,
and
that
he
felt
it
to
be
his
best
wisdom
to
push
the
interests
of
Robert
Gerard
Moore,
to
the
exclusion
of
philanthropic
consideration
for
general
interests,
with
which
he
regarded
the
said
Gerard
Moore
as
in
a
great
measure
disconnected.
Trade
was
Mr.
Moore's
hereditary
calling:
the
Gerards
of
Antwerp
had
been
merchants
for
two
centuries
back.
Once
they
had
been
wealthy
merchants;
but
the
uncertainties,
the
involvements,
of
business
had
come
upon
them;
disastrous
speculations
had
loosened
by
degrees
the
foundations
of
their
credit.
The
house
had
stood
on
a
tottering
base
for
a
dozen
years;
and
at
last,
in
the
shock
of
the
French
Revolution,
it
had
rushed
down
a
total
ruin.
In
its
fall
was
involved
the
English
and
Yorkshire
firm
of
Moore,
closely
connected
with
the
Antwerp
house,
and
of
which
one
of
the
partners,
resident
in
Antwerp,
Robert
Moore,
had
married
Hortense
Gerard,
with
the
prospect
of
his
bride
inheriting
her
father
Constantine
Gerard's
share
in
the
business.
She
inherited,
as
we
have
seen,
but
his
share
in
the
liabilities
of
the
firm;
and
these
liabilities,
though
duly
set
aside
by
a
composition
with
creditors,
some
said
her
son
Robert
accepted,
in
his
turn,
as
a
legacy,
and
that
he
aspired
one
day
to
discharge
them,
and
to
rebuild
the
fallen
house
of
Gerard
and
Moore
on
a
scale
at
least
equal
to
its
former
greatness.
It
was
even
supposed
that
he
took
by
past
circumstances
much
to
heart;
and
if
a
childhood
passed
at
the
side
of
a
saturnine
mother,
under
foreboding
of
coming
evil,
and
a
manhood
drenched
and
blighted
by
the
pitiless
descent
of
the
storm,
could
painfully
impress
the
mind,
his
probably
was
impressed
in
no
golden
characters.
If,
however,
he
had
a
great
end
of
restoration
in
view,
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
employ
great
means
for
its
attainment.
He
was
obliged
to
be
content
with
the
day
of
small
things.
When
he
came
to
Yorkshire,
he
whose
ancestors
had
owned
warehouses
in
this
seaport,
and
factories
in
that
inland
town,
had
possessed
their
town
house
and
their
country
seat
saw
no
way
open
to
him
but
to
rent
a
cloth
mill
in
an
out
of
the
way
nook
of
an
out
of
the
way
district;
to
take
a
cottage
adjoining
it
for
his
residence,
and
to
add
to
his
possessions,
as
pasture
for
his
horse,
and
space
for
his
cloth
tenters,
a
few
acres
of
the
steep,
rugged
land
that
lined
the
hollow
through
which
his
mill
stream
brawled.
All
this
he
held
at
a
somewhat
high
rent
(for
these
war
times
were
hard,
and
everything
was
dear)
of
the
trustees
of
the
Fieldhead
estate,
then
the
property
of
a
minor.
At
the
time
this
history
commences,
Robert
Moore
had
lived
but
two
years
in
the
district,
during
which
period
he
had
at
least
proved
himself
possessed
of
the
quality
of
activity.
The
dingy
cottage
was
converted
into
a
neat,
tasteful
residence.
Of
part
of
the
rough
land
he
had
made
garden
ground,
which
he
cultivated
with
singular,
even
with
Flemish,
exactness
and
care.
As
to
the
mill,
which
was
an
old
structure,
and
fitted
up
with
old
machinery,
now
become
inefficient
and
out
of
date,
he
had
from
the
first
evinced
the
strongest
contempt
for
all
its
arrangements
and
appointments.
His
aim
had
been
to
effect
a
radical
reform,
which
he
had
executed
as
fast
as
his
very
limited
capital
would
allow;
and
the
narrowness
of
that
capital,
and
consequent
check
on
his
progress,
was
a
restraint
which
galled
his
spirit
sorely.
Moore
ever
wanted
to
push
on.
"Forward"
was
the
device
stamped
upon
his
soul;
but
poverty
curbed
him.
Sometimes
(figuratively)
he
foamed
at
the
mouth
when
the
reins
were
drawn
very
tight.
In
this
state
of
feeling,
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
he
would
deliberate
much
as
to
whether
his
advance
was
or
was
not
prejudicial
to
others.
Not
being
a
native,
nor
for
any
length
of
time
a
resident
of
the
neighbourhood,
he
did
not
sufficiently
care
when
the
new
inventions
threw
the
old
workpeople
out
of
employ.
He
never
asked
himself
where
those
to
whom
he
no
longer
paid
weekly
wages
found
daily
bread;
and
in
this
negligence
he
only
resembled
thousands
besides,
on
whom
the
starving
poor
of
Yorkshire
seemed
to
have
a
closer
claim.
The
period
of
which
I
write
was
an
overshadowed
one
in
British
history,
and
especially
in
the
history
of
the
northern
provinces.
War
was
then
at
its
height.
Europe
was
all
involved
