not
(as
you
know,
reader)
the
Caroline
of
every
day,
thawed
his
reserve,
and
cheered
his
gravity
soon.
He
sat
near
her
and
talked
to
her.
She
already
knew
his
vocation
was
that
of
tuition.
She
learned
now
he
had
for
some
years
been
the
tutor
of
Mr.
Sympson's
son;
that
he
had
been
travelling
with
him,
and
had
accompanied
him
to
the
north.
She
inquired
if
he
liked
his
post,
but
got
a
look
in
reply
which
did
not
invite
or
license
further
question.
The
look
woke
Caroline's
ready
sympathy.
She
thought
it
a
very
sad
expression
to
pass
over
so
sensible
a
face
as
Louis's;
for
he
had
a
sensible
face,
though
not
handsome,
she
considered,
when
seen
near
Robert's.
She
turned
to
make
the
comparison.
Robert
was
leaning
against
the
wall,
a
little
behind
her,
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
book
of
engravings,
and
probably
listening,
at
the
same
time,
to
the
dialogue
between
her
and
Louis.
"How
could
I
think
them
alike?"
she
asked
herself.
"I
see
now
it
is
Hortense
Louis
resembles,
not
Robert."
And
this
was
in
part
true.
He
had
the
shorter
nose
and
longer
upper
lip
of
his
sister
rather
than
the
fine
traits
of
his
brother.
He
had
her
mould
of
mouth
and
chin
all
less
decisive,
accurate,
and
clear
than
those
of
the
young
mill
owner.
His
air,
though
deliberate
and
reflective,
could
scarcely
be
called
prompt
and
acute.
You
felt,
in
sitting
near
and
looking
up
at
him,
that
a
slower
and
probably
a
more
benignant
nature
than
that
of
the
elder
Moore
shed
calm
on
your
impressions.
Robert
perhaps
aware
that
Caroline's
glance
had
wandered
towards
and
dwelt
upon
him,
though
he
had
neither
met
nor
answered
it
put
down
the
book
of
engravings,
and
approaching,
took
a
seat
at
her
side.
She
resumed
her
conversation
with
Louis,
but
while
she
talked
to
him
her
thoughts
were
elsewhere.
Her
heart
beat
on
the
side
from
which
her
face
was
half
averted.
She
acknowledged
a
steady,
manly,
kindly
air
in
Louis;
but
she
bent
before
the
secret
power
of
Robert.
To
be
so
near
him
though
he
was
silent,
though
he
did
not
touch
so
much
as
her
scarf
fringe
or
the
white
hem
of
her
dress
affected
her
like
a
spell.
Had
she
been
obliged
to
speak
to
him
only,
it
would
have
quelled,
but,
at
liberty
to
address
another,
it
excited
her.
Her
discourse
flowed
freely;
it
was
gay,
playful,
eloquent.
The
indulgent
look
and
placid
manner
of
her
auditor
encouraged
her
to
ease;
the
sober
pleasure
expressed
by
his
smile
drew
out
all
that
was
brilliant
in
her
nature.
She
felt
that
this
evening
she
appeared
to
advantage,
and
as
Robert
was
a
spectator,
the
consciousness
contented
her.
Had
he
been
called
away,
collapse
would
at
once
have
succeeded
stimulus.
But
her
enjoyment
was
not
long
to
shine
full
orbed;
a
cloud
soon
crossed
it.
Hortense,
who
for
some
time
had
been
on
the
move
ordering
supper,
and
was
now
clearing
the
little
table
of
some
books,
etc.,
to
make
room
for
the
tray,
called
Robert's
attention
to
the
glass
of
flowers,
the
carmine
and
snow
and
gold
of
whose
petals
looked
radiant
indeed
by
candlelight.
"They
came
from
Fieldhead,"
she
said,
"intended
as
a
gift
to
you,
no
doubt.
We
know
who
is
the
favourite
there;
not
I,
I'm
sure."
It
was
a
wonder
to
hear
Hortense
jest
a
sign
that
her
spirits
were
at
high
water
mark
indeed.
"We
are
to
understand,
then,
that
Robert
is
the
favourite?"
observed
Louis.
"Mon
cher,"
replied
Hortense,
"Robert
c'est
tout
ce
qu'il
y
a
de
plus
precieux
au
monde;
a
cote
de
lui
le
reste
du
genre
humain
n'est
que
du
rebut.
N'ai
je
pas
raison,
mon
enfant?"
she
added,
appealing
to
Caroline.
Caroline
was
obliged
to
reply,
"Yes,"
and
her
beacon
was
quenched.
Her
star
withdrew
as
she
spoke.
"Et
toi,
Robert?"
inquired
Louis.
"When
you
shall
have
an
opportunity,
ask
herself,"
was
the
quiet
answer.
Whether
he
reddened
or
paled
Caroline
did
not
examine.
She
discovered
that
it
was
late,
and
she
must
go
home.
Home
she
would
go;
not
even
Robert
could
detain
her
now.
The
future
sometimes
seems
to
sob
a
low
warning
of
the
events
it
is
bringing
us,
like
some
gathering
though
yet
remote
storm,
which,
in
tones
of
the
wind,
in
flushings
of
the
firmament,
in
clouds
strangely
torn,
announces
a
blast
strong
to
strew
the
sea
with
wrecks;
or
commissioned
to
bring
in
fog
the
yellow
taint
of
pestilence
covering
white
Western
isles
with
the
poisoned
exhalations
of
the
East,
dimming
the
lattices
of
English
homes
with
the
breath
of
Indian
plague.
At
other
times
this
future
bursts
suddenly,
as
if
a
rock
had
rent,
and
in
it
a
grave
had
opened,
whence
issues
the
body
of
one
that
slept.
Ere
you
are
aware
you
stand
face
to
face
with
a
shrouded
and
unthought
of
calamity
a
new
Lazarus.
Caroline
Helstone
went
home
from
Hollow's
Cottage
in
good
health,
as
she
imagined.
On
waking
the
next
morning
she
felt
oppressed
with
unwonted
languor.
At
breakfast,
at
each
meal
of
the
following
day,
she
missed
all
sense
of
appetite.
Palatable
food
was
as
ashes
and
sawdust
to
her.
"Am
I
ill?"
she
asked,
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass.
Her
eyes
were
bright,
their
pupils
dilated,
her
cheeks
seemed
rosier,
and
fuller
than
usual.
"I
look
well;
why
can
I
not
eat?"
She
felt
a
pulse
beat
fast
in
her
temples;
she
felt,
too,
her
brain
in
strange
activity.
Her
spirits
were
raised;
hundreds
of
busy
and
broken
but
brilliant
thoughts
engaged
her
mind.
A
glow
rested
on
them,
such
as
tinged
her
complexion.
Now
followed
a
hot,
parched,
thirsty,
restless
night.
Towards
morning
one
terrible
dream
seized
her
like
a
tiger;
when
she
woke,
she
felt
and
knew
she
was
ill.
How
she
had
caught
the
fever
(fever
it
was)
she
could
not
tell.
Probably
in
her
