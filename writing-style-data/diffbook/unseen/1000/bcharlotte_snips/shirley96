Donne.
I
hope
you
won't
take
any
harm."
"That
I
shall,
no
doubt.
He
gave
me
a
turn
I
shall
not
soon
forget.
When
I
sor
him"
(such
was
Mr.
Donne's
pronunciation)
"about
to
spring,
I
thought
I
should
have
fainted."
"Perhaps
you
did
faint
in
the
bedroom;
you
were
a
long
time
there."
"No;
I
bore
up
that
I
might
hold
the
door
fast.
I
was
determined
not
to
let
any
one
enter.
I
thought
I
would
keep
a
barrier
between
me
and
the
enemy."
"But
what
if
your
friend
Mr.
Malone
had
been
worried?"
"Malone
must
take
care
of
himself.
Your
man
persuaded
me
to
come
out
at
last
by
saying
the
dog
was
chained
up
in
his
kennel.
If
I
had
not
been
assured
of
this,
I
would
have
remained
all
day
in
the
chamber.
But
what
is
that?
I
declare
the
man
has
told
a
falsehood!
The
dog
is
there!"
And
indeed
Tartar
walked
past
the
glass
door
opening
to
the
garden,
stiff,
tawny,
and
black
muzzled
as
ever.
He
still
seemed
in
bad
humour.
He
was
growling
again,
and
whistling
a
half
strangled
whistle,
being
an
inheritance
from
the
bulldog
side
of
his
ancestry.
"There
are
other
visitors
coming,"
observed
Shirley,
with
that
provoking
coolness
which
the
owners
of
formidable
looking
dogs
are
apt
to
show
while
their
animals
are
all
bristle
and
bay.
Tartar
sprang
down
the
pavement
towards
the
gate,
bellowing
avec
explosion.
His
mistress
quietly
opened
the
glass
door,
and
stepped
out
chirruping
to
him.
His
bellow
was
already
silenced,
and
he
was
lifting
up
his
huge,
blunt,
stupid
head
to
the
new
callers
to
be
patted.
"What!
Tartar,
Tartar!"
said
a
cheery,
rather
boyish
voice,
"don't
you
know
us?
Good
morning,
old
boy!"
And
little
Mr.
Sweeting,
whose
conscious
good
nature
made
him
comparatively
fearless
of
man,
woman,
child,
or
brute,
came
through
the
gate,
caressing
the
guardian.
His
vicar,
Mr.
Hall,
followed.
He
had
no
fear
of
Tartar
either,
and
Tartar
had
no
ill
will
to
him.
He
snuffed
both
the
gentlemen
round,
and
then,
as
if
concluding
that
they
were
harmless,
and
might
be
allowed
to
pass,
he
withdrew
to
the
sunny
front
of
the
hall,
leaving
the
archway
free.
Mr.
Sweeting
followed,
and
would
have
played
with
him;
but
Tartar
took
no
notice
of
his
caresses.
It
was
only
his
mistress's
hand
whose
touch
gave
him
pleasure;
to
all
others
he
showed
himself
obstinately
insensible.
Shirley
advanced
to
meet
Messrs.
Hall
and
Sweeting,
shaking
hands
with
them
cordially.
They
were
come
to
tell
her
of
certain
successes
they
had
achieved
that
morning
in
applications
for
subscriptions
to
the
fund.
Mr.
Hall's
eyes
beamed
benignantly
through
his
spectacles,
his
plain
face
looked
positively
handsome
with
goodness;
and
when
Caroline,
seeing
who
was
come,
ran
out
to
meet
him,
and
put
both
her
hands
into
his,
he
gazed
down
on
her
with
a
gentle,
serene,
affectionate
expression
that
gave
him
the
aspect
of
a
smiling
Melanchthon.
Instead
of
re
entering
the
house,
they
strayed
through
the
garden,
the
ladies
walking
one
on
each
side
of
Mr.
Hall.
It
was
a
breezy
sunny
day;
the
air
freshened
the
girls'
cheeks
and
gracefully
dishevelled
their
ringlets.
Both
of
them
looked
pretty
one
gay.
Mr.
Hall
spoke
oftenest
to
his
brilliant
companion,
looked
most
frequently
at
the
quiet
one.
Miss
Keeldar
gathered
handfuls
of
the
profusely
blooming
flowers
whose
perfume
filled
the
enclosure.
She
gave
some
to
Caroline,
telling
her
to
choose
a
nosegay
for
Mr.
Hall;
and
with
her
lap
filled
with
delicate
and
splendid
blossoms,
Caroline
sat
down
on
the
steps
of
a
summer
house.
The
vicar
stood
near
her,
leaning
on
his
cane.
Shirley,
who
could
not
be
inhospitable,
now
called
out
the
neglected
pair
in
the
oak
parlour.
She
convoyed
Donne
past
his
dread
enemy
Tartar,
who,
with
his
nose
on
his
fore
paws,
lay
snoring
under
the
meridian
sun.
Donne
was
not
grateful
he
never
was
grateful
for
kindness
and
attention
but
he
was
glad
of
the
safeguard.
Miss
Keeldar,
desirous
of
being
impartial,
offered
the
curates
flowers.
They
accepted
them
with
native
awkwardness.
Malone
seemed
specially
at
a
loss,
when
a
bouquet
filled
one
hand,
while
his
shillelah
occupied
the
other.
Donne's
"Thank
you!"
was
rich
to
hear.
It
was
the
most
fatuous
and
arrogant
of
sounds,
implying
that
he
considered
this
offering
a
homage
to
his
merits,
and
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
heiress
to
ingratiate
herself
into
his
priceless
affections.
Sweeting
alone
received
the
posy
like
a
smart,
sensible
little
man,
as
he
was,
putting
it
gallantly
and
nattily
into
his
buttonhole.
As
a
reward
for
his
good
manners,
Miss
Keeldar,
beckoning
him
apart,
gave
him
some
commission,
which
made
his
eyes
sparkle
with
glee.
Away
he
flew,
round
by
the
courtyard
to
the
kitchen.
No
need
to
give
him
directions;
he
was
always
at
home
everywhere.
Ere
long
he
reappeared,
carrying
a
round
table,
which
he
placed
under
the
cedar;
then
he
collected
six
garden
chairs
from
various
nooks
and
bowers
in
the
grounds,
and
placed
them
in
a
circle.
The
parlour
maid
Miss
Keeldar
kept
no
footman
came
out,
bearing
a
napkin
covered
tray.
Sweeting's
nimble
fingers
aided
in
disposing
glasses,
plates,
knives,
and
forks;
he
assisted
her
too
in
setting
forth
a
neat
luncheon,
consisting
of
cold
chicken,
ham,
and
tarts.
This
sort
of
impromptu
regale
it
was
Shirley's
delight
to
offer
any
chance
guests;
and
nothing
pleased
her
better
than
to
have
an
alert,
obliging
little
friend,
like
Sweeting,
to
run
about
her
hand,
cheerily
receive
and
briskly
execute
her
hospitable
hints.
David
and
she
were
on
the
best
terms
in
the
world;
and
his
devotion
to
the
heiress
was
quite
disinterested,
since
it
prejudiced
in
nothing
his
faithful
allegiance
to
the
magnificent
Dora
Sykes.
The
repast
turned
out
a
very
merry
one.
Donne
and
Malone,
indeed,
contributed
but
little
to
its
vivacity,
the
chief
part
they
played
in
it
being
what
concerned
the
knife,
fork,
and
wine
glass;
