before
nor
any
female,
save,
now
and
then,
a
village
girl
come
to
gather
nuts.
To
night
the
apparition
does
not
displease
him.
He
observes,
as
she
approaches,
that
she
is
neither
old
nor
plain,
but,
on
the
contrary,
very
youthful;
and,
but
that
he
now
recognizes
her
for
one
whom
he
has
often
wilfully
pronounced
ugly,
he
would
deem
that
he
discovered
traits
of
beauty
behind
the
thin
gauze
of
that
veil.
She
passes
him
and
says
nothing.
He
knew
she
would.
All
women
are
proud
monkeys,
and
he
knows
no
more
conceited
doll
than
that
Caroline
Helstone.
The
thought
is
hardly
hatched
in
his
mind
when
the
lady
retraces
those
two
steps
she
had
got
beyond
him,
and
raising
her
veil,
reposes
her
glance
on
his
face,
while
she
softly
asks,
"Are
you
one
of
Mr.
Yorke's
sons?"
No
human
evidence
would
ever
have
been
able
to
persuade
Martin
Yorke
that
he
blushed
when
thus
addressed;
yet
blush
he
did,
to
the
ears.
"I
am,"
he
said
bluntly,
and
encouraged
himself
to
wonder,
superciliously,
what
would
come
next.
"You
are
Martin,
I
think?"
was
the
observation
that
followed.
It
could
not
have
been
more
felicitous.
It
was
a
simple
sentence
very
artlessly,
a
little
timidly,
pronounced;
but
it
chimed
in
harmony
to
the
youth's
nature.
It
stilled
him
like
a
note
of
music.
Martin
had
a
keen
sense
of
his
personality;
he
felt
it
right
and
sensible
that
the
girl
should
discriminate
him
from
his
brothers.
Like
his
father,
he
hated
ceremony.
It
was
acceptable
to
hear
a
lady
address
him
as
"Martin,"
and
not
Mr.
Martin
or
Master
Martin,
which
form
would
have
lost
her
his
good
graces
for
ever.
Worse,
if
possible,
than
ceremony
was
the
other
extreme
of
slipshod
familiarity.
The
slight
tone
of
bashfulness,
the
scarcely
perceptible
hesitation,
was
considered
perfectly
in
place.
"I
am
Martin,"
he
said.
"Are
your
father
and
mother
well?"
(it
was
lucky
she
did
not
say
papa
and
mamma;
that
would
have
undone
all);
"and
Rose
and
Jessie?"
"I
suppose
so."
"My
cousin
Hortense
is
still
at
Briarmains?"
"Oh
yes."
Martin
gave
a
comic
half
smile
and
demi
groan.
The
half
smile
was
responded
to
by
the
lady,
who
could
guess
in
what
sort
of
odour
Hortense
was
likely
to
be
held
by
the
young
Yorkes.
"Does
your
mother
like
her?"
"They
suit
so
well
about
the
servants
they
can't
help
liking
each
other."
"It
is
cold
to
night."
"Why
are
you
out
so
late?"
"I
lost
my
way
in
this
wood."
Now,
indeed,
Martin
allowed
himself
a
refreshing
laugh
of
scorn.
"Lost
your
way
in
the
mighty
forest
of
Briarmains!
You
deserve
never
more
to
find
it."
"I
never
was
here
before,
and
I
believe
I
am
trespassing
now.
You
might
inform
against
me
if
you
chose,
Martin,
and
have
me
fined.
It
is
your
father's
wood."
"I
should
think
I
knew
that.
But
since
you
are
so
simple
as
to
lose
your
way,
I
will
guide
you
out."
"You
need
not.
I
have
got
into
the
track
now.
I
shall
be
right.
Martin"
(a
little
quickly),
"how
is
Mr.
Moore?"
Martin
had
heard
certain
rumours;
it
struck
him
that
it
might
be
amusing
to
make
an
experiment.
"Going
to
die.
Nothing
can
save
him.
All
hope
flung
overboard!"
She
put
her
veil
aside.
She
looked
into
his
eyes,
and
said,
"To
die!"
"To
die.
All
along
of
the
women,
my
mother
and
the
rest.
They
did
something
about
his
bandages
that
finished
everything.
He
would
have
got
better
but
for
them.
I
am
sure
they
should
be
arrested,
cribbed,
tried,
and
brought
in
for
Botany
Bay,
at
the
very
least."
The
questioner,
perhaps,
did
nor
hear
this
judgment.
She
stood
motionless.
In
two
minutes,
without
another
word,
she
moved
forwards;
no
good
night,
no
further
inquiry.
This
was
not
amusing,
nor
what
Martin
had
calculated
on.
He
expected
something
dramatic
and
demonstrative.
It
was
hardly
worth
while
to
frighten
the
girl
if
she
would
not
entertain
him
in
return.
He
called,
"Miss
Helstone!"
She
did
not
hear
or
turn.
He
hastened
after
and
overtook
her.
"Come;
are
you
uneasy
about
what
I
said?"
"You
know
nothing
about
death,
Martin;
you
are
too
young
for
me
to
talk
to
concerning
such
a
thing."
"Did
you
believe
me?
It's
all
flummery!
Moore
eats
like
three
men.
They
are
always
making
sago
or
tapioca
or
something
good
for
him.
I
never
go
into
the
kitchen
but
there
is
a
saucepan
on
the
fire,
cooking
him
some
dainty.
I
think
I
will
play
the
old
soldier,
and
be
fed
on
the
fat
of
the
land
like
him."
"Martin!
Martin!"
Here
her
voice
trembled,
and
she
stopped.
"It
is
exceedingly
wrong
of
you,
Martin.
You
have
almost
killed
me."
Again
she
stopped.
She
leaned
against
a
tree,
trembling,
shuddering,
and
as
pale
as
death.
Martin
contemplated
her
with
inexpressible
curiosity.
In
one
sense
it
was,
as
he
would
have
expressed
it,
"nuts"
to
him
to
see
this.
It
told
him
so
much,
and
he
was
beginning
to
have
a
great
relish
for
discovering
secrets.
In
another
sense
it
reminded
him
of
what
he
had
once
felt
when
he
had
heard
a
blackbird
lamenting
for
her
nestlings,
which
Matthew
had
crushed
with
a
stone,
and
that
was
not
a
pleasant
feeling.
Unable
to
find
anything
very
appropriate
to
say
in
order
to
comfort
her,
he
began
to
cast
about
in
his
mind
what
he
could
do.
He
smiled.
The
lad's
smile
gave
wondrous
transparency
to
his
physiognomy.
"Eureka!"
he
cried.
"I'll
set
all
straight
by
and
by.
You
are
better
now,
Miss
Caroline.
Walk
forward,"
he
urged.
Not
reflecting
that
it
would
be
more
difficult
for
Miss
Helstone
than
for
himself
to
climb
a
wall
or
penetrate
a
hedge,
he
piloted
her
by
a
short
cut
which
led
to
no
gate.
The
consequence
was
he
had
to
help
her
over
some
formidable
obstacles,
and
while
he
railed
at
her
for
helplessness,
he
perfectly
