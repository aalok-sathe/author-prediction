for
the
wood.
It
was
yet
but
half
past
three.
It
had
been
a
fine
morning,
but
the
sky
looked
dark
now.
It
was
beginning
to
snow;
the
wind
blew
cold;
the
wood
looked
dismal,
the
old
tree
grim.
Yet
Martin
approved
the
shadow
on
his
path.
He
found
a
charm
in
the
spectral
aspect
of
the
doddered
oak.
He
had
to
wait.
To
and
fro
he
walked,
while
the
flakes
fell
faster;
and
the
wind,
which
at
first
had
but
moaned,
pitifully
howled.
"She
is
long
in
coming,"
he
muttered,
as
he
glanced
along
the
narrow
track.
"I
wonder,"
he
subjoined,
"what
I
wish
to
see
her
so
much
for?
She
is
not
coming
for
me.
But
I
have
power
over
her,
and
I
want
her
to
come
that
I
may
use
that
power."
He
continued
his
walk.
"Now,"
he
resumed,
when
a
further
period
had
elapsed,
"if
she
fails
to
come,
I
shall
hate
and
scorn
her."
It
struck
four.
He
heard
the
church
clock
far
away.
A
step
so
quick,
so
light,
that,
but
for
the
rustling
of
leaves,
it
would
scarcely
have
sounded
on
the
wood
walk,
checked
his
impatience.
The
wind
blew
fiercely
now,
and
the
thickening
white
storm
waxed
bewildering;
but
on
she
came,
and
not
dismayed.
"Well,
Martin,"
she
said
eagerly,
"how
is
he?"
"It
is
queer
how
she
thinks
of
him,"
reflected
Martin.
"The
blinding
snow
and
bitter
cold
are
nothing
to
her,
I
believe;
yet
she
is
but
a
'chitty
faced
creature,'
as
my
mother
would
say.
I
could
find
in
my
heart
to
wish
I
had
a
cloak
to
wrap
her
in."
Thus
meditating
to
himself,
he
neglected
to
answer
Miss
Helstone.
"You
have
seen
him?"
"No."
"Oh!
you
promised
you
would."
"I
mean
to
do
better
by
you
than
that.
Didn't
I
say
I
don't
care
to
see
him?"
"But
now
it
will
be
so
long
before
I
get
to
know
any
thing
certain
about
him,
and
I
am
sick
of
waiting.
Martin,
do
see
him,
and
give
him
Caroline
Helstone's
regards,
and
say
she
wished
to
know
how
he
was,
and
if
anything
could
be
done
for
his
comfort."
"I
won't."
"You
are
changed.
You
were
so
friendly
last
night."
"Come,
we
must
not
stand
in
this
wood;
it
is
too
cold."
"But
before
I
go
promise
me
to
come
again
to
morrow
with
news."
"No
such
thing.
I
am
much
too
delicate
to
make
and
keep
such
appointments
in
the
winter
season.
If
you
knew
what
a
pain
I
had
in
my
chest
this
morning,
and
how
I
went
without
breakfast,
and
was
knocked
down
besides,
you'd
feel
the
impropriety
of
bringing
me
here
in
the
snow.
Come,
I
say."
"Are
you
really
delicate,
Martin?"
"Don't
I
look
so?"
"You
have
rosy
cheeks."
"That's
hectic.
Will
you
come
or
you
won't?"
"Where?"
"With
me.
I
was
a
fool
not
to
bring
a
cloak.
I
would
have
made
you
cosy."
"You
are
going
home;
my
nearest
road
lies
in
the
opposite
direction."
"Put
your
arm
through
mine;
I'll
take
care
of
you."
"But
the
wall
the
hedge
it
is
such
hard
work
climbing,
and
you
are
too
slender
and
young
to
help
me
without
hurting
yourself."
"You
shall
go
through
the
gate."
"But
"
"But,
but
will
you
trust
me
or
not?"
She
looked
into
his
face.
"I
think
I
will.
Anything
rather
than
return
as
anxious
as
I
came."
"I
can't
answer
for
that.
This,
however,
I
promise
you:
be
ruled
by
me,
and
you
shall
see
Moore
yourself."
"See
him
myself?"
"Yourself."
"But,
dear
Martin,
does
he
know?"
"Ah!
I'm
dear
now.
No,
he
doesn't
know."
"And
your
mother
and
the
others?"
"All
is
right."
Caroline
fell
into
a
long,
silent
fit
of
musing,
but
still
she
walked
on
with
her
guide.
They
came
in
sight
of
Briarmains.
"Have
you
made
up
your
mind?"
he
asked.
She
was
silent.
"Decide;
we
are
just
on
the
spot.
I
won't
see
him
that
I
tell
you
except
to
announce
your
arrival."
"Martin,
you
are
a
strange
boy,
and
this
is
a
strange
step;
but
all
I
feel
is
and
has
been,
for
a
long
time,
strange.
I
will
see
him."
"Having
said
that,
you
will
neither
hesitate
nor
retract?"
"No."
"Here
we
are,
then.
Do
not
be
afraid
of
passing
the
parlour
window;
no
one
will
see
you.
My
father
and
Matthew
are
at
the
mill,
Mark
is
at
school,
the
servants
are
in
the
back
kitchen,
Miss
Moore
is
at
the
cottage,
my
mother
in
her
bed,
and
Mrs.
Horsfall
in
paradise.
Observe
I
need
not
ring.
I
open
the
door;
the
hall
is
empty,
the
staircase
quiet;
so
is
the
gallery.
The
whole
house
and
all
its
inhabitants
are
under
a
spell,
which
I
will
not
break
till
you
are
gone."
"Martin,
I
trust
you."
"You
never
said
a
better
word.
Let
me
take
your
shawl.
I
will
shake
off
the
snow
and
dry
it
for
you.
You
are
cold
and
wet.
Never
mind;
there
is
a
fire
upstairs.
Are
you
ready?"
"Yes."
"Follow
me."
He
left
his
shoes
on
the
mat,
mounted
the
stair
unshod.
Caroline
stole
after,
with
noiseless
step.
There
was
a
gallery,
and
there
was
a
passage;
at
the
end
of
that
passage
Martin
paused
before
a
door
and
tapped.
He
had
to
tap
twice
thrice.
A
voice,
known
to
one
listener,
at
last
said,
"Come
in."
The
boy
entered
briskly.
"Mr.
Moore,
a
lady
called
to
inquire
after
you.
None
of
the
women
were
about.
It
is
washing
day,
and
the
maids
are
over
the
crown
of
the
head
in
soap
suds
in
the
back
kitchen,
so
I
asked
her
to
step
up."
"Up
here,
sir?"
"Up
here,
sir;
but
if
you
object,
she
shall
go
down
again."
"Is
this
a
place
or
am
I
a
person
to
bring
a
lady
to,
you
absurd
lad?"
"No;
so
I'll
take
her
off."
"Martin,
you
will
stay
here.
Who
is
she?"
"Your
grandmother
