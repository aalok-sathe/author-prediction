therein.
England,
if
not
weary,
was
worn
with
long
resistance
yes,
and
half
her
people
were
weary
too,
and
cried
out
for
peace
on
any
terms.
National
honour
was
become
a
mere
empty
name,
of
no
value
in
the
eyes
of
many,
because
their
sight
was
dim
with
famine;
and
for
a
morsel
of
meat
they
would
have
sold
their
birthright.
The
"Orders
in
Council,"
provoked
by
Napoleon's
Milan
and
Berlin
decrees,
and
forbidding
neutral
powers
to
trade
with
France,
had,
by
offending
America,
cut
off
the
principal
market
of
the
Yorkshire
woollen
trade,
and
brought
it
consequently
to
the
verge
of
ruin.
Minor
foreign
markets
were
glutted,
and
would
receive
no
more.
The
Brazils,
Portugal,
Sicily,
were
all
overstocked
by
nearly
two
years'
consumption.
At
this
crisis
certain
inventions
in
machinery
were
introduced
into
the
staple
manufactures
of
the
north,
which,
greatly
reducing
the
number
of
hands
necessary
to
be
employed,
threw
thousands
out
of
work,
and
left
them
without
legitimate
means
of
sustaining
life.
A
bad
harvest
supervened.
Distress
reached
its
climax.
Endurance,
overgoaded,
stretched
the
hand
of
fraternity
to
sedition.
The
throes
of
a
sort
of
moral
earthquake
were
felt
heaving
under
the
hills
of
the
northern
counties.
But,
as
is
usual
in
such
cases,
nobody
took
much
notice.
When
a
food
riot
broke
out
in
a
manufacturing
town,
when
a
gig
mill
was
burnt
to
the
ground,
or
a
manufacturer's
house
was
attacked,
the
furniture
thrown
into
the
streets,
and
the
family
forced
to
flee
for
their
lives,
some
local
measures
were
or
were
not
taken
by
the
local
magistracy.
A
ringleader
was
detected,
or
more
frequently
suffered
to
elude
detection;
newspaper
paragraphs
were
written
on
the
subject,
and
there
the
thing
stopped.
As
to
the
sufferers,
whose
sole
inheritance
was
labour,
and
who
had
lost
that
inheritance
who
could
not
get
work,
and
consequently
could
not
get
wages,
and
consequently
could
not
get
bread
they
were
left
to
suffer
on,
perhaps
inevitably
left.
It
would
not
do
to
stop
the
progress
of
invention,
to
damage
science
by
discouraging
its
improvements;
the
war
could
not
be
terminated;
efficient
relief
could
not
be
raised.
There
was
no
help
then;
so
the
unemployed
underwent
their
destiny
ate
the
bread
and
drank
the
waters
of
affliction.
Misery
generates
hate.
These
sufferers
hated
the
machines
which
they
believed
took
their
bread
from
them;
they
hated
the
buildings
which
contained
those
machines;
they
hated
the
manufacturers
who
owned
those
buildings.
In
the
parish
of
Briarfield,
with
which
we
have
at
present
to
do,
Hollow's
Mill
was
the
place
held
most
abominable;
Gerard
Moore,
in
his
double
character
of
semi
foreigner
and
thorough
going
progressist,
the
man
most
abominated.
And
it
perhaps
rather
agreed
with
Moore's
temperament
than
otherwise
to
be
generally
hated,
especially
when
he
believed
the
thing
for
which
he
was
hated
a
right
and
an
expedient
thing;
and
it
was
with
a
sense
of
warlike
excitement
he,
on
this
night,
sat
in
his
counting
house
waiting
the
arrival
of
his
frame
laden
wagons.
Malone's
coming
and
company
were,
it
may
be,
most
unwelcome
to
him.
He
would
have
preferred
sitting
alone;
for
he
liked
a
silent,
sombre,
unsafe
solitude.
His
watchman's
musket
would
have
been
company
enough
for
him;
the
full
flowing
beck
in
the
den
would
have
delivered
continuously
the
discourse
most
genial
to
his
ear.
With
the
queerest
look
in
the
world
had
the
manufacturer
for
some
ten
minutes
been
watching
the
Irish
curate,
as
the
latter
made
free
with
the
punch,
when
suddenly
that
steady
gray
eye
changed,
as
if
another
vision
came
between
it
and
Malone.
Moore
raised
his
hand.
"Chut!"
he
said
in
his
French
fashion,
as
Malone
made
a
noise
with
his
glass.
He
listened
a
moment,
then
rose,
put
his
hat
on,
and
went
out
at
the
counting
house
door.
The
night
was
still,
dark,
and
stagnant:
the
water
yet
rushed
on
full
and
fast;
its
flow
almost
seemed
a
flood
in
the
utter
silence.
Moore's
ear,
however,
caught
another
sound,
very
distant
but
yet
dissimilar,
broken
and
rugged
in
short,
a
sound
of
heavy
wheels
crunching
a
stony
road.
He
returned
to
the
counting
house
and
lit
a
lantern,
with
which
he
walked
down
the
mill
yard,
and
proceeded
to
open
the
gates.
The
big
wagons
were
coming
on;
the
dray
horses'
huge
hoofs
were
heard
splashing
in
the
mud
and
water.
Moore
hailed
them.
"Hey,
Joe
Scott!
Is
all
right?"
Probably
Joe
Scott
was
yet
at
too
great
a
distance
to
hear
the
inquiry.
He
did
not
answer
it.
"Is
all
right,
I
say?"
again
asked
Moore,
when
the
elephant
like
leader's
nose
almost
touched
his.
Some
one
jumped
out
from
the
foremost
wagon
into
the
road;
a
voice
cried
aloud,
"Ay,
ay,
divil;
all's
raight!
We've
smashed
'em."
And
there
was
a
run.
The
wagons
stood
still;
they
were
now
deserted.
"Joe
Scott!"
No
Joe
Scott
answered.
"Murgatroyd!
Pighills!
Sykes!"
No
reply.
Mr.
Moore
lifted
his
lantern
and
looked
into
the
vehicles.
There
was
neither
man
nor
machinery;
they
were
empty
and
abandoned.
Now
Mr.
Moore
loved
his
machinery.
He
had
risked
the
last
of
his
capital
on
the
purchase
of
these
frames
and
shears
which
to
night
had
been
expected.
Speculations
most
important
to
his
interests
depended
on
the
results
to
be
wrought
by
them.
Where
were
they?
The
words
"we've
smashed
'em"
rang
in
his
ears.
How
did
the
catastrophe
affect
him?
By
the
light
of
the
lantern
he
held
were
his
features
visible,
relaxing
to
a
singular
smile
the
smile
the
man
of
determined
spirit
wears
when
he
reaches
a
juncture
in
his
life
where
this
determined
spirit
is
to
feel
a
demand
on
its
strength,
when
the
strain
is
to
be
made,
and
the
faculty
must
bear
or
break.
Yet
he
remained
silent,
and
even
motionless;
for
at
the
instant
he
neither
knew
what
to
say
nor
what
to
do.
He
placed
the
lantern
on
the
ground,
and
stood
with
his
arms
folded,
gazing
down
