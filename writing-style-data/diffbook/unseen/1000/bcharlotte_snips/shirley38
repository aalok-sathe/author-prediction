nodded
so."
"And
there
was
Dr.
Broadbent,"
cried
Hannah
"such
a
beautiful
speaker!
You
couldn't
expect
it
of
him,
for
he
is
almost
a
vulgar
looking
man."
"But
such
a
dear
man,"
interrupted
Mary.
"And
such
a
good
man,
such
a
useful
man,"
added
her
mother.
"Only
like
a
butcher
in
appearance,"
interposed
the
fair,
proud
Harriet.
"I
couldn't
bear
to
look
at
him.
I
listened
with
my
eyes
shut."
Miss
Helstone
felt
her
ignorance
and
incompetency.
Not
having
seen
Dr.
Broadbent,
she
could
not
give
her
opinion.
Pause
third
came
on.
During
its
continuance,
Caroline
was
feeling
at
her
heart's
core
what
a
dreaming
fool
she
was,
what
an
unpractical
life
she
led,
how
little
fitness
there
was
in
her
for
ordinary
intercourse
with
the
ordinary
world.
She
was
feeling
how
exclusively
she
had
attached
herself
to
the
white
cottage
in
the
Hollow,
how
in
the
existence
of
one
inmate
of
that
cottage
she
had
pent
all
her
universe.
She
was
sensible
that
this
would
not
do,
and
that
some
day
she
would
be
forced
to
make
an
alteration.
It
could
not
be
said
that
she
exactly
wished
to
resemble
the
ladies
before
her,
but
she
wished
to
become
superior
to
her
present
self,
so
as
to
feel
less
scared
by
their
dignity.
The
sole
means
she
found
of
reviving
the
flagging
discourse
was
by
asking
them
if
they
would
all
stay
to
tea;
and
a
cruel
struggle
it
cost
her
to
perform
this
piece
of
civility.
Mrs.
Sykes
had
begun,
"We
are
much
obliged
to
you,
but
"
when
in
came
Fanny
once
more.
"The
gentlemen
will
stay
the
evening,
ma'am,"
was
the
message
she
brought
from
Mr.
Helstone.
"What
gentlemen
have
you?"
now
inquired
Mrs.
Sykes.
Their
names
were
specified;
she
and
her
daughters
interchanged
glances.
The
curates
were
not
to
them
what
they
were
to
Caroline.
Mr.
Sweeting
was
quite
a
favourite
with
them;
even
Mr.
Malone
rather
so,
because
he
was
a
clergyman.
"Really,
since
you
have
company
already,
I
think
we
will
stay,"
remarked
Mrs.
Sykes.
"We
shall
be
quite
a
pleasant
little
party.
I
always
like
to
meet
the
clergy."
And
now
Caroline
had
to
usher
them
upstairs,
to
help
them
to
unshawl,
smooth
their
hair,
and
make
themselves
smart;
to
reconduct
them
to
the
drawing
room,
to
distribute
amongst
them
books
of
engravings,
or
odd
things
purchased
from
the
Jew
basket.
She
was
obliged
to
be
a
purchaser,
though
she
was
but
a
slack
contributor;
and
if
she
had
possessed
plenty
of
money,
she
would
rather,
when
it
was
brought
to
the
rectory
an
awful
incubus!
have
purchased
the
whole
stock
than
contributed
a
single
pin
cushion.
It
ought
perhaps
to
be
explained
in
passing,
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
not
au
fait
to
the
mysteries
of
the
"Jew
basket"
and
"missionary
basket,"
that
these
meubles
are
willow
repositories,
of
the
capacity
of
a
good
sized
family
clothes
basket,
dedicated
to
the
purpose
of
conveying
from
house
to
house
a
monster
collection
of
pin
cushions,
needle
books,
card
racks,
workbags,
articles
of
infant
wear,
etc.,
etc.,
etc.,
made
by
the
willing
or
reluctant
hands
of
the
Christian
ladies
of
a
parish,
and
sold
perforce
to
the
heathenish
gentlemen
thereof,
at
prices
unblushingly
exorbitant.
The
proceeds
of
such
compulsory
sales
are
applied
to
the
conversion
of
the
Jews,
the
seeking
up
of
the
ten
missing
tribes,
or
to
the
regeneration
of
the
interesting
coloured
population
of
the
globe.
Each
lady
contributor
takes
it
in
her
turn
to
keep
the
basket
a
month,
to
sew
for
it,
and
to
foist
off
its
contents
on
a
shrinking
male
public.
An
exciting
time
it
is
when
that
turn
comes
round.
Some
active
minded
woman,
with
a
good
trading
spirit,
like
it,
and
enjoy
exceedingly
the
fun
of
making
hard
handed
worsted
spinners
cash
up,
to
the
tune
of
four
or
five
hundred
per
cent.
above
cost
price,
for
articles
quite
useless
to
them;
other
feebler
souls
object
to
it,
and
would
rather
see
the
prince
of
darkness
himself
at
their
door
any
morning
than
that
phantom
basket,
brought
with
"Mrs.
Rouse's
compliments;
and
please,
ma'am,
she
says
it's
your
turn
now."
Miss
Helstone's
duties
of
hostess
performed,
more
anxiously
than
cheerily,
she
betook
herself
to
the
kitchen,
to
hold
a
brief
privy
council
with
Fanny
and
Eliza
about
the
tea.
"What
a
lot
on
'em!"
cried
Eliza,
who
was
cook.
"And
I
put
off
the
baking
to
day
because
I
thought
there
would
be
bread
plenty
to
fit
while
morning.
We
shall
never
have
enow."
"Are
there
any
tea
cakes?"
asked
the
young
mistress.
"Only
three
and
a
loaf.
I
wish
these
fine
folk
would
stay
at
home
till
they're
asked;
and
I
want
to
finish
trimming
my
hat"
(bonnet
she
meant).
"Then,"
suggested
Caroline,
to
whom
the
importance
of
the
emergency
gave
a
certain
energy,
"Fanny
must
run
down
to
Briarfield
and
buy
some
muffins
and
crumpets
and
some
biscuits.
And
don't
be
cross,
Eliza;
we
can't
help
it
now."
"And
which
tea
things
are
we
to
have?"
"Oh,
the
best,
I
suppose.
I'll
get
out
the
silver
service."
And
she
ran
upstairs
to
the
plate
closet,
and
presently
brought
down
teapot,
cream
ewer,
and
sugar
basin.
"And
mun
we
have
th'
urn?"
"Yes;
and
now
get
it
ready
as
quickly
as
you
can,
for
the
sooner
we
have
tea
over
the
sooner
they
will
go
at
least,
I
hope
so.
Heigh
ho!
I
wish
they
were
gone,"
she
sighed,
as
she
returned
to
the
drawing
room.
"Still,"
she
thought,
as
she
paused
at
the
door
ere
opening
it,
"if
Robert
would
but
come
even
now
how
bright
all
would
be!
How
comparatively
easy
the
task
of
amusing
these
people
if
he
were
present!
There
would
be
an
interest
in
hearing
him
talk
(though
he
never
says
much
in
company)
and
in
talking
in
his
presence.
There
can
be
no
interest
in
hearing
any
of
them,
or
in
speaking
to
them.
How
