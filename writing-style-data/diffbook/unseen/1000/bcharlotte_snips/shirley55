but
they
must
come
and
see.
Jessy
was
about
to
reply,
when
one
of
the
boys
unexpectedly
broke
in,
"I
know
that
Miss
Helstone
you
have
all
been
palavering
about.
She's
an
ugly
girl.
I
hate
her.
I
hate
all
womenites.
I
wonder
what
they
were
made
for."
"Martin!"
said
his
father,
for
Martin
it
was.
The
lad
only
answered
by
turning
his
cynical
young
face,
half
arch,
half
truculent,
towards
the
paternal
chair.
"Martin,
my
lad,
thou'rt
a
swaggering
whelp
now;
thou
wilt
some
day
be
an
outrageous
puppy.
But
stick
to
those
sentiments
of
thine.
See,
I'll
write
down
the
words
now
i'
my
pocket
book."
(The
senior
took
out
a
morocco
covered
book,
and
deliberately
wrote
therein.)
"Ten
years
hence,
Martin,
if
thou
and
I
be
both
alive
at
that
day,
I'll
remind
thee
of
that
speech."
"I'll
say
the
same
then.
I
mean
always
to
hate
women.
They're
such
dolls;
they
do
nothing
but
dress
themselves
finely,
and
go
swimming
about
to
be
admired.
I'll
never
marry.
I'll
be
a
bachelor."
"Stick
to
it!
stick
to
it!
Hesther"
(addressing
his
wife),
"I
was
like
him
when
I
was
his
age
a
regular
misogamist;
and,
behold!
by
the
time
I
was
three
and
twenty
being
then
a
tourist
in
France
and
Italy,
and
the
Lord
knows
where
I
curled
my
hair
every
night
before
I
went
to
bed,
and
wore
a
ring
i'
my
ear,
and
would
have
worn
one
i'
my
nose
if
it
had
been
the
fashion,
and
all
that
I
might
make
myself
pleasing
and
charming
to
the
ladies.
Martin
will
do
the
like."
"Will
I?
Never!
I've
more
sense.
What
a
guy
you
were,
father!
As
to
dressing,
I
make
this
vow:
I'll
never
dress
more
finely
than
as
you
see
me
at
present.
Mr.
Moore,
I'm
clad
in
blue
cloth
from
top
to
toe,
and
they
laugh
at
me,
and
call
me
sailor
at
the
grammar
school.
I
laugh
louder
at
them,
and
say
they
are
all
magpies
and
parrots,
with
their
coats
one
colour,
and
their
waistcoats
another,
and
their
trousers
a
third.
I'll
always
wear
blue
cloth,
and
nothing
but
blue
cloth.
It
is
beneath
a
human
being's
dignity
to
dress
himself
in
parti
coloured
garments."
"Ten
years
hence,
Martin,
no
tailor's
shop
will
have
choice
of
colours
varied
enough
for
thy
exacting
taste;
no
perfumer's
stores
essences
exquisite
enough
for
thy
fastidious
senses."
Martin
looked
disdain,
but
vouchsafed
no
further
reply.
Meantime
Mark,
who
for
some
minutes
had
been
rummaging
amongst
a
pile
of
books
on
a
side
table,
took
the
word.
He
spoke
in
a
peculiarly
slow,
quiet
voice,
and
with
an
expression
of
still
irony
in
his
face
not
easy
to
describe.
"Mr.
Moore,"
said
he,
"you
think
perhaps
it
was
a
compliment
on
Miss
Caroline
Helstone's
part
to
say
you
were
not
sentimental.
I
thought
you
appeared
confused
when
my
sisters
told
you
the
words,
as
if
you
felt
flattered.
You
turned
red,
just
like
a
certain
vain
little
lad
at
our
school,
who
always
thinks
proper
to
blush
when
he
gets
a
rise
in
the
class.
For
your
benefit,
Mr.
Moore,
I've
been
looking
up
the
word
'sentimental'
in
the
dictionary,
and
I
find
it
to
mean
'tinctured
with
sentiment.'
On
examining
further,
'sentiment'
is
explained
to
be
thought,
idea,
notion.
A
sentimental
man,
then,
is
one
who
has
thoughts,
ideas,
notions;
an
unsentimental
man
is
one
destitute
of
thought,
idea,
or
notion."
And
Mark
stopped.
He
did
not
smile,
he
did
not
look
round
for
admiration.
He
had
said
his
say,
and
was
silent.
"Ma
foi!
mon
ami,"
observed
Mr.
Moore
to
Yorke,
"ce
sont
vraiment
des
enfants
terribles,
que
les
votres!"
Rose,
who
had
been
listening
attentively
to
Mark's
speech,
replied
to
him,
"There
are
different
kinds
of
thoughts,
ideas,
and
notions,"
said
she,
"good
and
bad.
Sentimental
must
refer
to
the
bad,
or
Miss
Helstone
must
have
taken
it
in
that
sense,
for
she
was
not
blaming
Mr.
Moore;
she
was
defending
him."
"That's
my
kind
little
advocate!"
said
Moore,
taking
Rose's
hand.
"She
was
defending
him,"
repeated
Rose,
"as
I
should
have
done
had
I
been
in
her
place,
for
the
other
ladies
seemed
to
speak
spitefully."
"Ladies
always
do
speak
spitefully,"
observed
Martin.
"It
is
the
nature
of
womenites
to
be
spiteful."
Matthew
now,
for
the
first
time,
opened
his
lips.
"What
a
fool
Martin
is,
to
be
always
gabbling
about
what
he
does
not
understand!"
"It
is
my
privilege,
as
a
freeman,
to
gabble
on
whatever
subject
I
like,"
responded
Martin.
"You
use
it,
or
rather
abuse
it,
to
such
an
extent,"
rejoined
the
elder
brother,
"that
you
prove
you
ought
to
have
been
a
slave."
"A
slave!
a
slave!
That
to
a
Yorke,
and
from
a
Yorke!
This
fellow,"
he
added,
standing
up
at
the
table,
and
pointing
across
it
to
Matthew
"this
fellow
forgets,
what
every
cottier
in
Briarfield
knows,
that
all
born
of
our
house
have
that
arched
instep
under
which
water
can
flow
proof
that
there
has
not
been
a
slave
of
the
blood
for
three
hundred
years."
"Mountebank!"
said
Matthew.
"Lads,
be
silent!"
exclaimed
Mr.
Yorke.
"Martin,
you
are
a
mischief
maker.
There
would
have
been
no
disturbance
but
for
you."
"Indeed!
Is
that
correct?
Did
I
begin,
or
did
Matthew?
Had
I
spoken
to
him
when
he
accused
me
of
gabbling
like
a
fool?"
"A
presumptuous
fool!"
repeated
Matthew.
Here
Mrs.
Yorke
commenced
rocking
herself
rather
a
portentous
movement
with
her,
as
it
was
occasionally
followed,
especially
when
Matthew
was
worsted
in
a
conflict,
by
a
fit
of
hysterics.
"I
don't
see
why
I
should
bear
insolence
from
Matthew
Yorke,
or
what
right
he
has
to
use
bad
language
to
me,"
observed
Martin.
"He
has
no
right,
my
lad;
but
forgive
your
brother
until
seventy
and
seven
times,"
said
Mr.
Yorke
soothingly.
"Always
alike,
and
theory
and
practice
always
adverse!"
murmured
Martin
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
room.
"Where
art
thou
going,
