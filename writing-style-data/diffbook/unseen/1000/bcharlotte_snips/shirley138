the
labour
of
persuading
the
stubborn,
the
constant
burden
and
task
of
training
the
best."
"But
with
love
it
need
not
be
so
very
difficult,"
interposed
Caroline.
"Mothers
love
their
children
most
dearly
almost
better
than
they
love
themselves."
"Fine
talk!
very
sentimental!
There
is
the
rough,
practical
part
of
life
yet
to
come
for
you,
young
miss."
"But,
Mrs.
Yorke,
if
I
take
a
little
baby
into
my
arms
any
poor
woman's
infant,
for
instance
I
feel
that
I
love
that
helpless
thing
quite
peculiarly,
though
I
am
not
its
mother.
I
could
do
almost
anything
for
it
willingly,
if
it
were
delivered
over
entirely
to
my
care
if
it
were
quite
dependent
on
me."
"You
feel!
Yes,
yes!
I
dare
say,
now.
You
are
led
a
great
deal
by
your
feelings,
and
you
think
yourself
a
very
sensitive
personage,
no
doubt.
Are
you
aware
that,
with
all
these
romantic
ideas,
you
have
managed
to
train
your
features
into
an
habitually
lackadaisical
expression,
better
suited
to
a
novel
heroine
than
to
a
woman
who
is
to
make
her
way
in
the
real
world
by
dint
of
common
sense?"
"No;
I
am
not
at
all
aware
of
that,
Mrs.
Yorke."
"Look
in
the
glass
just
behind
you.
Compare
the
face
you
see
there
with
that
of
any
early
rising,
hard
working
milkmaid."
"My
face
is
a
pale
one,
but
it
is
not
sentimental;
and
most
milkmaids,
however
red
and
robust
they
may
be,
are
more
stupid
and
less
practically
fitted
to
make
their
way
in
the
world
than
I
am.
I
think
more,
and
more
correctly,
than
milkmaids
in
general
do;
consequently,
where
they
would
often,
for
want
of
reflection,
act
weakly,
I,
by
dint
of
reflection,
should
act
judiciously."
"Oh
no!
you
would
be
influenced
by
your
feelings;
you
would
be
guided
by
impulse."
"Of
course
I
should
often
be
influenced
by
my
feelings.
They
were
given
me
to
that
end.
Whom
my
feelings
teach
me
to
love
I
must
and
shall
love;
and
I
hope,
if
ever
I
have
a
husband
and
children,
my
feelings
will
induce
me
to
love
them.
I
hope,
in
that
case,
all
my
impulses
will
be
strong
in
compelling
me
to
love."
Caroline
had
a
pleasure
in
saying
this
with
emphasis;
she
had
a
pleasure
in
daring
to
say
it
in
Mrs.
Yorke's
presence.
She
did
not
care
what
unjust
sarcasm
might
be
hurled
at
her
in
reply.
She
flushed,
not
with
anger
but
excitement,
when
the
ungenial
matron
answered
coolly,
"Don't
waste
your
dramatic
effects.
That
was
well
said
it
was
quite
fine;
but
it
is
lost
on
two
women
an
old
wife
and
an
old
maid.
There
should
have
been
a
disengaged
gentleman
present.
Is
Mr.
Robert
nowhere
hid
behind
the
curtains,
do
you
think,
Miss
Moore?"
Hortense,
who
during
the
chief
part
of
the
conversation
had
been
in
the
kitchen
superintending
the
preparations
for
tea,
did
not
yet
quite
comprehend
the
drift
of
the
discourse.
She
answered,
with
a
puzzled
air,
that
Robert
was
at
Whinbury.
Mrs.
Yorke
laughed
her
own
peculiar
short
laugh.
"Straightforward
Miss
Moore!"
said
she
patronizingly.
"It
is
like
you
to
understand
my
question
so
literally
and
answer
it
so
simply.
Your
mind
comprehends
nothing
of
intrigue.
Strange
things
might
go
on
around
you
without
your
being
the
wiser;
you
are
not
of
the
class
the
world
calls
sharp
witted."
These
equivocal
compliments
did
not
seem
to
please
Hortense.
She
drew
herself
up,
puckered
her
black
eyebrows,
but
still
looked
puzzled.
"I
have
ever
been
noted
for
sagacity
and
discernment
from
childhood,"
she
returned;
for,
indeed,
on
the
possession
of
these
qualities
she
peculiarly
piqued
herself.
"You
never
plotted
to
win
a
husband,
I'll
be
bound,"
pursued
Mrs.
Yorke;
"and
you
have
not
the
benefit
of
previous
experience
to
aid
you
in
discovering
when
others
plot."
Caroline
felt
this
kind
language
where
the
benevolent
speaker
intended
she
should
feel
it
in
her
very
heart.
She
could
not
even
parry
the
shafts;
she
was
defenceless
for
the
present.
To
answer
would
have
been
to
avow
that
the
cap
fitted.
Mrs.
Yorke,
looking
at
her
as
she
sat
with
troubled,
downcast
eyes,
and
cheek
burning
painfully,
and
figure
expressing
in
its
bent
attitude
and
unconscious
tremor
all
the
humiliation
and
chagrin
she
experienced,
felt
the
sufferer
was
fair
game.
The
strange
woman
had
a
natural
antipathy
to
a
shrinking,
sensitive
character
a
nervous
temperament;
nor
was
a
pretty,
delicate,
and
youthful
face
a
passport
to
her
affections.
It
was
seldom
she
met
with
all
these
obnoxious
qualities
combined
in
one
individual;
still
more
seldom
she
found
that
individual
at
her
mercy,
under
circumstances
in
which
she
could
crush
her
well.
She
happened
this
afternoon
to
be
specially
bilious
and
morose
as
much
disposed
to
gore
as
any
vicious
"mother
of
the
herd."
Lowering
her
large
head
she
made
a
new
charge.
"Your
cousin
Hortense
is
an
excellent
sister,
Miss
Helstone.
Such
ladies
as
come
to
try
their
life's
luck
here
at
Hollow's
Cottage
may,
by
a
very
little
clever
female
artifice,
cajole
the
mistress
of
the
house,
and
have
the
game
all
in
their
own
hands.
You
are
fond
of
your
cousin's
society,
I
dare
say,
miss?"
"Of
which
cousin's?"
"Oh,
of
the
lady's,
of
course."
"Hortense
is,
and
always
has
been,
most
kind
to
me."
"Every
sister
with
an
eligible
single
brother
is
considered
most
kind
by
her
spinster
friends."
"Mrs.
Yorke,"
said
Caroline,
lifting
her
eyes
slowly,
their
blue
orbs
at
the
same
time
clearing
from
trouble,
and
shining
steady
and
full,
while
the
glow
of
shame
left
her
cheek,
and
its
hue
turned
pale
and
settled
"Mrs.
Yorke,
may
I
ask
what
you
mean?"
"To
give
you
a
lesson
on
the
cultivation
of
rectitude,
to
disgust
you
with
craft
and
false
sentiment."
"Do
I
need
this
lesson?"
"Most
young
ladies
of
the
present
day
need
it.
You
are
quite
a
modern
young
lady
morbid,
delicate,
professing
to
like
retirement;
which
implies,
I
suppose,
that
you
