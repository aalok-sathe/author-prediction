not
show
that
to
any
one
in
Briarfield
but
you,
because
you
can
take
it
quietly."
"Certainly
there
is
nothing
in
the
little
mark
to
shock.
Its
history
will
explain."
"Small
as
it
is,
it
has
taken
my
sleep
away,
and
made
me
nervous,
thin,
and
foolish;
because,
on
account
of
that
little
mark,
I
am
obliged
to
look
forward
to
a
possibility
that
has
its
terrors."
The
sleeve
was
readjusted,
the
bracelet
replaced.
"Do
you
know
that
you
try
me?"
he
said,
smiling.
"I
am
a
patient
sort
of
man,
but
my
pulse
is
quickening."
"Whatever
happens,
you
will
befriend
me,
Mr.
Moore?
You
will
give
me
the
benefit
of
your
self
possession,
and
not
leave
me
at
the
mercy
of
agitated
cowards?"
"I
make
no
promise
now.
Tell
me
the
tale,
and
then
exact
what
pledge
you
will."
"It
is
a
very
short
tale.
I
took
a
walk
with
Isabella
and
Gertrude
one
day,
about
three
weeks
ago.
They
reached
home
before
me;
I
stayed
behind
to
speak
to
John.
After
leaving
him,
I
pleased
myself
with
lingering
in
the
lane,
where
all
was
very
still
and
shady.
I
was
tired
of
chattering
to
the
girls,
and
in
no
hurry
to
rejoin
them.
As
I
stood
leaning
against
the
gate
pillar,
thinking
some
very
happy
thoughts
about
my
future
life
for
that
morning
I
imagined
that
events
were
beginning
to
turn
as
I
had
long
wished
them
to
turn
"
"Ah!
Nunnely
had
been
with
her
the
evening
before!"
thought
Moore
parenthetically.
"I
heard
a
panting
sound;
a
dog
came
running
up
the
lane.
I
know
most
of
the
dogs
in
this
neighbourhood.
It
was
Pheabe,
one
of
Mr.
Sam
Wynne's
pointers.
The
poor
creature
ran
with
her
head
down,
her
tongue
hanging
out;
she
looked
as
if
bruised
and
beaten
all
over.
I
called
her.
I
meant
to
coax
her
into
the
house
and
give
her
some
water
and
dinner.
I
felt
sure
she
had
been
ill
used.
Mr.
Sam
often
flogs
his
pointers
cruelly.
She
was
too
flurried
to
know
me;
and
when
I
attempted
to
pat
her
head,
she
turned
and
snatched
at
my
arm.
She
bit
it
so
as
to
draw
blood,
then
ran
panting
on.
Directly
after,
Mr.
Wynne's
keeper
came
up,
carrying
a
gun.
He
asked
if
I
had
seen
a
dog.
I
told
him
I
had
seen
Pheabe.
"'You
had
better
chain
up
Tartar,
ma'am,'
he
said,
'and
tell
your
people
to
keep
within
the
house.
I
am
after
Pheabe
to
shoot
her,
and
the
groom
is
gone
another
way.
She
is
raging
mad.'"
Mr.
Moore
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
folded
his
arms
across
his
chest.
Miss
Keeldar
resumed
her
square
of
silk
canvas,
and
continued
the
creation
of
a
wreath
of
Parmese
violets.
"And
you
told
no
one,
sought
no
help,
no
cure?
You
would
not
come
to
me?"
"I
got
as
far
as
the
schoolroom
door;
there
my
courage
failed.
I
preferred
to
cushion
the
matter."
"Why?
What
can
I
demand
better
in
this
world
than
to
be
of
use
to
you?"
"I
had
no
claim."
"Monstrous!
And
you
did
nothing?"
"Yes.
I
walked
straight
into
the
laundry,
where
they
are
ironing
most
of
the
week,
now
that
I
have
so
many
guests
in
the
house.
While
the
maid
was
busy
crimping
or
starching,
I
took
an
Italian
iron
from
the
fire,
and
applied
the
light
scarlet
glowing
tip
to
my
arm.
I
bored
it
well
in.
It
cauterized
the
little
wound.
Then
I
went
upstairs."
"I
dare
say
you
never
once
groaned?"
"I
am
sure
I
don't
know.
I
was
very
miserable
not
firm
or
tranquil
at
all,
I
think.
There
was
no
calm
in
my
mind."
"There
was
calm
in
your
person.
I
remember
listening
the
whole
time
we
sat
at
luncheon,
to
hear
if
you
moved
in
the
room
above.
All
was
quiet."
"I
was
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
bed,
wishing
Pheabe
had
not
bitten
me."
"And
alone.
You
like
solitude."
"Pardon
me."
"You
disdain
sympathy."
"Do
I,
Mr.
Moore?"
"With
your
powerful
mind
you
must
feel
independent
of
help,
of
advice,
of
society."
"So
be
it,
since
it
pleases
you."
She
smiled.
She
pursued
her
embroidery
carefully
and
quickly,
but
her
eyelash
twinkled,
and
then
it
glittered,
and
then
a
drop
fell.
Mr.
Moore
leaned
forward
on
his
desk,
moved
his
chair,
altered
his
attitude.
"If
it
is
not
so,"
he
asked,
with
a
peculiar,
mellow
change
in
his
voice,
"how
is
it,
then?"
"I
don't
know."
"You
do
know,
but
you
won't
speak.
All
must
be
locked
up
in
yourself."
"Because
it
is
not
worth
sharing."
"Because
nobody
can
give
the
high
price
you
require
for
your
confidence.
Nobody
is
rich
enough
to
purchase
it.
Nobody
has
the
honour,
the
intellect,
the
power
you
demand
in
your
adviser.
There
is
not
a
shoulder
in
England
on
which
you
would
rest
your
hand
for
support,
far
less
a
bosom
which
you
would
permit
to
pillow
your
head.
Of
course
you
must
live
alone."
"I
can
live
alone,
if
need
be.
But
the
question
is
not
how
to
live,
but
how
to
die
alone.
That
strikes
me
in
a
more
grisly
light."
"You
apprehend
the
effects
of
the
virus?
You
anticipate
an
indefinitely
threatening,
dreadful
doom?"
She
bowed.
"You
are
very
nervous
and
womanish."
"You
complimented
me
two
minutes
since
on
my
powerful
mind."
"You
are
very
womanish.
If
the
whole
affair
were
coolly
examined
and
discussed,
I
feel
assured
it
would
turn
out
that
there
is
no
danger
of
your
dying
at
all."
"Amen!
I
am
very
willing
to
live,
if
it
please
God.
I
have
felt
life
sweet."
"How
can
it
be
otherwise
than
sweet
with
your
endowments
and
nature?
Do
you
truly
expect
that
you
will
be
seized
with
hydrophobia,
and
die
raving
mad?"
"I
expect
it,
and
have
feared
it.
Just
now
I
fear
nothing."
"Nor
do
I,
on
your
account.
I
doubt
whether
the
smallest
particle
of
