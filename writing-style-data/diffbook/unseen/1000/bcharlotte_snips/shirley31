science,
since
we
are
going
to
study?"
"It
appears
so."
"And
you
are
not
going
to
be
French,
and
sceptical,
and
sneering?
You
are
not
going
to
think
it
a
sign
of
wisdom
to
refuse
to
admire?"
"I
don't
know."
"If
you
do,
Robert,
I'll
take
Shakespeare
away;
and
I'll
shrivel
up
within
myself,
and
put
on
my
bonnet
and
go
home."
"Sit
down.
Here
I
begin."
"One
minute,
if
you
please,
brother,"
interrupted
mademoiselle.
"When
the
gentleman
of
a
family
reads,
the
ladies
should
always
sew.
Caroline,
dear
child,
take
your
embroidery.
You
may
get
three
sprigs
done
to
night."
Caroline
looked
dismayed.
"I
can't
see
by
lamp
light;
my
eyes
are
tired,
and
I
can't
do
two
things
well
at
once.
If
I
sew,
I
cannot
listen;
if
I
listen,
I
cannot
sew."
"Fi,
donc!
Quel
enfantillage!"
began
Hortense.
Mr.
Moore,
as
usual,
suavely
interposed.
"Permit
her
to
neglect
the
embroidery
for
this
evening.
I
wish
her
whole
attention
to
be
fixed
on
my
accent;
and
to
ensure
this,
she
must
follow
the
reading
with
her
eyes
she
must
look
at
the
book."
He
placed
it
between
them,
reposed
his
arm
on
the
back
of
Caroline's
chair,
and
thus
began
to
read.
The
very
first
scene
in
"Coriolanus"
came
with
smart
relish
to
his
intellectual
palate,
and
still
as
he
read
he
warmed.
He
delivered
the
haughty
speech
of
Caius
Marcius
to
the
starving
citizens
with
unction;
he
did
not
say
he
thought
his
irrational
pride
right,
but
he
seemed
to
feel
it
so.
Caroline
looked
up
at
him
with
a
singular
smile.
"There's
a
vicious
point
hit
already,"
she
said.
"You
sympathize
with
that
proud
patrician
who
does
not
sympathize
with
his
famished
fellow
men,
and
insults
them.
There,
go
on."
He
proceeded.
The
warlike
portions
did
not
rouse
him
much;
he
said
all
that
was
out
of
date,
or
should
be;
the
spirit
displayed
was
barbarous;
yet
the
encounter
single
handed
between
Marcius
and
Tullus
Aufidius
he
delighted
in.
As
he
advanced,
he
forgot
to
criticise;
it
was
evident
he
appreciated
the
power,
the
truth
of
each
portion;
and,
stepping
out
of
the
narrow
line
of
private
prejudices,
began
to
revel
in
the
large
picture
of
human
nature,
to
feel
the
reality
stamped
upon
the
characters
who
were
speaking
from
that
page
before
him.
He
did
not
read
the
comic
scenes
well;
and
Caroline,
taking
the
book
out
of
his
hand,
read
these
parts
for
him.
From
her
he
seemed
to
enjoy
them,
and
indeed
she
gave
them
with
a
spirit
no
one
could
have
expected
of
her,
with
a
pithy
expression
with
which
she
seemed
gifted
on
the
spot,
and
for
that
brief
moment
only.
It
may
be
remarked,
in
passing,
that
the
general
character
of
her
conversation
that
evening,
whether
serious
or
sprightly,
grave
or
gay,
was
as
of
something
untaught,
unstudied,
intuitive,
fitful
when
once
gone,
no
more
to
be
reproduced
as
it
had
been
than
the
glancing
ray
of
the
meteor,
than
the
tints
of
the
dew
gem,
than
the
colour
or
form
of
the
sunset
cloud,
than
the
fleeting
and
glittering
ripple
varying
the
flow
of
a
rivulet.
Coriolanus
in
glory,
Coriolanus
in
disaster,
Coriolanus
banished,
followed
like
giant
shades
one
after
the
other.
Before
the
vision
of
the
banished
man
Moore's
spirit
seemed
to
pause.
He
stood
on
the
hearth
of
Aufidius's
hall,
facing
the
image
of
greatness
fallen,
but
greater
than
ever
in
that
low
estate.
He
saw
"the
grim
appearance,"
the
dark
face
"bearing
command
in
it,"
"the
noble
vessel
with
its
tackle
torn."
With
the
revenge
of
Caius
Marcius,
Moore
perfectly
sympathized;
he
was
not
scandalized
by
it;
and
again
Caroline
whispered,
"There
I
see
another
glimpse
of
brotherhood
in
error."
The
march
on
Rome,
the
mother's
supplication,
the
long
resistance,
the
final
yielding
of
bad
passions
to
good,
which
ever
must
be
the
case
in
a
nature
worthy
the
epithet
of
noble,
the
rage
of
Aufidius
at
what
he
considered
his
ally's
weakness,
the
death
of
Coriolanus,
the
final
sorrow
of
his
great
enemy
all
scenes
made
of
condensed
truth
and
strength
came
on
in
succession
and
carried
with
them
in
their
deep,
fast
flow
the
heart
and
mind
of
reader
and
listener.
"Now,
have
you
felt
Shakespeare?"
asked
Caroline,
some
ten
minutes
after
her
cousin
had
closed
the
book.
"I
think
so."
"And
have
you
felt
anything
in
Coriolanus
like
you?"
"Perhaps
I
have."
"Was
he
not
faulty
as
well
as
great?"
Moore
nodded.
"And
what
was
his
fault?
What
made
him
hated
by
the
citizens?
What
caused
him
to
be
banished
by
his
countrymen?"
"What
do
you
think
it
was?"
"I
ask
again
'Whether
was
it
pride,
Which
out
of
daily
fortune
ever
taints
The
happy
man?
whether
defect
of
judgment,
To
fail
in
the
disposing
of
those
chances
Which
he
was
lord
of?
or
whether
nature,
Not
to
be
other
than
one
thing,
not
moving
From
the
casque
to
the
cushion,
but
commanding
peace
Even
with
the
same
austerity
and
garb
As
he
controlled
the
war?'"
"Well,
answer
yourself,
Sphinx."
"It
was
a
spice
of
all;
and
you
must
not
be
proud
to
your
workpeople;
you
must
not
neglect
chances
of
soothing
them;
and
you
must
not
be
of
an
inflexible
nature,
uttering
a
request
as
austerely
as
if
it
were
a
command."
"That
is
the
moral
you
tack
to
the
play.
What
puts
such
notions
into
your
head?"
"A
wish
for
your
good,
a
care
for
your
safety,
dear
Robert,
and
a
fear,
caused
by
many
things
which
I
have
heard
lately,
that
you
will
come
to
harm."
"Who
tells
you
these
things?"
"I
hear
my
uncle
talk
about
you.
He
praises
your
hard
spirit,
your
determined
cast
of
mind,
your
scorn
of
low
enemies,
your
resolution
not
'to
truckle
to
the
mob,'
as
he
says."
"And
would
you
have
me
truckle
to
them?"
"No,
not
for
the
world.
I
never
wish
you
to
lower
yourself;
but
somehow
I
cannot
help
thinking
