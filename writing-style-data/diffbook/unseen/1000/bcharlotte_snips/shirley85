for
its
narrow
stripe
of
pale
azure,
her
complexion
unflushed,
unexcited,
the
very
brownness
of
her
hair
and
eyes
invisible
by
this
faint
light,
she
was,
compared
with
the
heiress,
as
a
graceful
pencil
sketch
compared
with
a
vivid
painting.
Since
Robert
had
seen
her
last
a
great
change
had
been
wrought
in
her.
Whether
he
perceived
it
might
not
be
ascertained.
He
said
nothing
to
that
effect.
"How
is
Hortense?"
asked
Caroline
softly.
"Very
well;
but
she
complains
of
being
unemployed.
She
misses
you."
"Tell
her
that
I
miss
her,
and
that
I
write
and
read
a
portion
of
French
every
day."
"She
will
ask
if
you
sent
your
love;
she
is
always
particular
on
that
point.
You
know
she
likes
attention."
"My
best
love
my
very
best.
And
say
to
her
that
whenever
she
has
time
to
write
me
a
little
note
I
shall
be
glad
to
hear
from
her."
"What
if
I
forget?
I
am
not
the
surest
messenger
of
compliments."
"No,
don't
forget,
Robert.
It
is
no
compliment;
it
is
in
good
earnest."
"And
must,
therefore,
be
delivered
punctually."
"If
you
please."
"Hortense
will
be
ready
to
shed
tears.
She
is
tenderhearted
on
the
subject
of
her
pupil;
yet
she
reproaches
you
sometimes
for
obeying
your
uncle's
injunctions
too
literally.
Affection,
like
love,
will
be
unjust
now
and
then."
And
Caroline
made
no
answer
to
this
observation;
for
indeed
her
heart
was
troubled,
and
to
her
eyes
she
would
have
raised
her
handkerchief
if
she
had
dared.
If
she
had
dared,
too,
she
would
have
declared
how
the
very
flowers
in
the
garden
of
Hollow's
Cottage
were
dear
to
her;
how
the
little
parlour
of
that
house
was
her
earthly
paradise;
how
she
longed
to
return
to
it,
as
much
almost
as
the
first
woman,
in
her
exile,
must
have
longed
to
revisit
Eden.
Not
daring,
however,
to
say
these
things,
she
held
her
peace;
she
sat
quiet
at
Robert's
side,
waiting
for
him
to
say
something
more.
It
was
long
since
this
proximity
had
been
hers
long
since
his
voice
had
addressed
her;
could
she,
with
any
show
of
probability,
even
of
possibility,
have
imagined
that
the
meeting
gave
him
pleasure,
to
her
it
would
have
given
deep
bliss.
Yet,
even
in
doubt
that
it
pleased,
in
dread
that
it
might
annoy
him,
she
received
the
boon
of
the
meeting
as
an
imprisoned
bird
would
the
admission
of
sunshine
to
its
cage.
It
was
of
no
use
arguing,
contending
against
the
sense
of
present
happiness;
to
be
near
Robert
was
to
be
revived.
Miss
Keeldar
laid
down
the
papers.
"And
are
you
glad
or
sad
for
all
these
menacing
tidings?"
she
inquired
of
her
tenant.
"Not
precisely
either;
but
I
certainly
am
instructed.
I
see
that
our
only
plan
is
to
be
firm.
I
see
that
efficient
preparation
and
a
resolute
attitude
are
the
best
means
of
averting
bloodshed."
He
then
inquired
if
she
had
observed
some
particular
paragraph,
to
which
she
replied
in
the
negative,
and
he
rose
to
show
it
to
her.
He
continued
the
conversation
standing
before
her.
From
the
tenor
of
what
he
said,
it
appeared
evident
that
they
both
apprehended
disturbances
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Briarfield,
though
in
what
form
they
expected
them
to
break
out
was
not
specified.
Neither
Caroline
nor
Mrs.
Pryor
asked
questions.
The
subject
did
not
appear
to
be
regarded
as
one
ripe
for
free
discussion;
therefore
the
lady
and
her
tenant
were
suffered
to
keep
details
to
themselves,
unimportuned
by
the
curiosity
of
their
listeners.
Miss
Keeldar,
in
speaking
to
Mr.
Moore,
took
a
tone
at
once
animated
and
dignified,
confidential
and
self
respecting.
When,
however,
the
candles
were
brought
in,
and
the
fire
was
stirred
up,
and
the
fullness
of
light
thus
produced
rendered
the
expression
of
her
countenance
legible,
you
could
see
that
she
was
all
interest,
life,
and
earnestness.
There
was
nothing
coquettish
in
her
demeanour;
whatever
she
felt
for
Moore
she
felt
it
seriously.
And
serious,
too,
were
his
feelings,
and
settled
were
his
views,
apparently,
for
he
made
no
petty
effort
to
attract,
dazzle,
or
impress.
He
contrived,
notwithstanding,
to
command
a
little;
because
the
deeper
voice,
however
mildly
modulated,
the
somewhat
harder
mind,
now
and
then,
though
involuntarily
and
unintentionally,
bore
down
by
some
peremptory
phrase
or
tone
the
mellow
accents
and
susceptible,
if
high,
nature
of
Shirley.
Miss
Keeldar
looked
happy
in
conversing
with
him,
and
her
joy
seemed
twofold
a
joy
of
the
past
and
present,
of
memory
and
of
hope.
What
I
have
just
said
are
Caroline's
ideas
of
the
pair.
She
felt
what
has
just
been
described.
In
thus
feeling
she
tried
not
to
suffer,
but
suffered
sharply
nevertheless.
She
suffered,
indeed,
miserably.
A
few
minutes
before
her
famished
heart
had
tasted
a
drop
and
crumb
of
nourishment,
that,
if
freely
given,
would
have
brought
back
abundance
of
life
where
life
was
failing;
but
the
generous
feast
was
snatched
from
her,
spread
before
another,
and
she
remained
but
a
bystander
at
the
banquet.
The
clock
struck
nine;
it
was
Caroline's
time
for
going
home.
She
gathered
up
her
work,
put
the
embroidery,
the
scissors,
the
thimble
into
her
bag.
She
bade
Mrs.
Pryor
a
quiet
good
night,
receiving
from
that
lady
a
warmer
pressure
of
the
hand
than
usual.
She
stepped
up
to
Miss
Keeldar.
"Good
night,
Shirley!"
Shirley
started
up.
"What!
so
soon?
Are
you
going
already?"
"It
is
past
nine."
"I
never
heard
the
clock.
You
will
come
again
to
morrow,
and
you
will
be
happy
to
night,
will
you
not?
Remember
our
plans."
"Yes,"
said
Caroline;
"I
have
not
forgotten."
Her
mind
misgave
her
that
neither
those
plans
nor
any
other
could
permanently
restore
her
mental
tranquillity.
She
turned
to
Robert,
who
stood
close
behind
her.
As
he
looked
up,
the
light
of
the
candles
on
the
mantelpiece
fell
full
on
her
face.
All
its
paleness,
all
its
change,
all
its
forlorn
meaning
were
clearly
revealed.
Robert
had
good
eyes,
and
might
