I
am
sure
he
will
not
be
cold
to
morrow.
I
feel
almost
certain
that
to
morrow
evening
he
will
either
come
here,
or
ask
me
to
go
there."
She
recommenced
combing
her
hair,
long
as
a
mermaid's.
Turning
her
head
as
she
arranged
it
she
saw
her
own
face
and
form
in
the
glass.
Such
reflections
are
soberizing
to
plain
people:
their
own
eyes
are
not
enchanted
with
the
image;
they
are
confident
then
that
the
eyes
of
others
can
see
in
it
no
fascination.
But
the
fair
must
naturally
draw
other
conclusions:
the
picture
is
charming,
and
must
charm.
Caroline
saw
a
shape,
a
head,
that,
daguerreotyped
in
that
attitude
and
with
that
expression,
would
have
been
lovely.
She
could
not
choose
but
derive
from
the
spectacle
confirmation
to
her
hopes.
It
was
then
in
undiminished
gladness
she
sought
her
couch.
And
in
undiminished
gladness
she
rose
the
next
day.
As
she
entered
her
uncle's
breakfast
room,
and
with
soft
cheerfulness
wished
him
good
morning,
even
that
little
man
of
bronze
himself
thought,
for
an
instant,
his
niece
was
growing
"a
fine
girl."
Generally
she
was
quiet
and
timid
with
him
very
docile,
but
not
communicative;
this
morning,
however,
she
found
many
things
to
say.
Slight
topics
alone
might
be
discussed
between
them;
for
with
a
woman
a
girl
Mr.
Helstone
would
touch
on
no
other.
She
had
taken
an
early
walk
in
the
garden,
and
she
told
him
what
flowers
were
beginning
to
spring
there;
she
inquired
when
the
gardener
was
to
come
and
trim
the
borders;
she
informed
him
that
certain
starlings
were
beginning
to
build
their
nests
in
the
church
tower
(Briarfield
church
was
close
to
Briarfield
rectory);
she
wondered
the
tolling
of
the
bells
in
the
belfry
did
not
scare
them.
Mr.
Helstone
opined
that
"they
were
like
other
fools
who
had
just
paired
insensible
to
inconvenience
just
for
the
moment."
Caroline,
made
perhaps
a
little
too
courageous
by
her
temporary
good
spirits,
here
hazarded
a
remark
of
a
kind
she
had
never
before
ventured
to
make
on
observations
dropped
by
her
revered
relative.
"Uncle,"
said
she,
"whenever
you
speak
of
marriage
you
speak
of
it
scornfully.
Do
you
think
people
shouldn't
marry?"
"It
is
decidedly
the
wisest
plan
to
remain
single,
especially
for
women."
"Are
all
marriages
unhappy?"
"Millions
of
marriages
are
unhappy.
If
everybody
confessed
the
truth,
perhaps
all
are
more
or
less
so."
"You
are
always
vexed
when
you
are
asked
to
come
and
marry
a
couple.
Why?"
"Because
one
does
not
like
to
act
as
accessory
to
the
commission
of
a
piece
of
pure
folly."
Mr.
Helstone
spoke
so
readily,
he
seemed
rather
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
give
his
niece
a
piece
of
his
mind
on
this
point.
Emboldened
by
the
impunity
which
had
hitherto
attended
her
questions,
she
went
a
little
further.
"But
why,"
said
she,
"should
it
be
pure
folly?
If
two
people
like
each
other,
why
shouldn't
they
consent
to
live
together?"
"They
tire
of
each
other
they
tire
of
each
other
in
a
month.
A
yokefellow
is
not
a
companion;
he
or
she
is
a
fellow
sufferer."
It
was
by
no
means
naive
simplicity
which
inspired
Caroline's
next
remark;
it
was
a
sense
of
antipathy
to
such
opinions,
and
of
displeasure
at
him
who
held
them.
"One
would
think
you
had
never
been
married,
uncle.
One
would
think
you
were
an
old
bachelor."
"Practically,
I
am
so."
"But
you
have
been
married.
Why
were
you
so
inconsistent
as
to
marry?"
"Every
man
is
mad
once
or
twice
in
his
life."
"So
you
tired
of
my
aunt,
and
my
aunt
of
you,
and
you
were
miserable
together?"
Mr.
Helstone
pushed
out
his
cynical
lip,
wrinkled
his
brown
forehead,
and
gave
an
inarticulate
grunt.
"Did
she
not
suit
you?
Was
she
not
good
tempered?
Did
you
not
get
used
to
her?
Were
you
not
sorry
when
she
died?"
"Caroline,"
said
Mr.
Helstone,
bringing
his
hand
slowly
down
to
within
an
inch
or
two
of
the
table,
and
then
smiting
it
suddenly
on
the
mahogany,
"understand
this:
it
is
vulgar
and
puerile
to
confound
generals
with
particulars.
In
every
case
there
is
the
rule
and
there
are
the
exceptions.
Your
questions
are
stupid
and
babyish.
Ring
the
bell,
if
you
have
done
breakfast."
The
breakfast
was
taken
away,
and
that
meal
over,
it
was
the
general
custom
of
uncle
and
niece
to
separate,
and
not
to
meet
again
till
dinner;
but
to
day
the
niece,
instead
of
quitting
the
room,
went
to
the
window
seat,
and
sat
down
there.
Mr.
Helstone
looked
round
uneasily
once
or
twice,
as
if
he
wished
her
away;
but
she
was
gazing
from
the
window,
and
did
not
seem
to
mind
him:
so
he
continued
the
perusal
of
his
morning
paper
a
particularly
interesting
one
it
chanced
to
be,
as
new
movements
had
just
taken
place
in
the
Peninsula,
and
certain
columns
of
the
journal
were
rich
in
long
dispatches
from
General
Lord
Wellington.
He
little
knew,
meantime,
what
thoughts
were
busy
in
his
niece's
mind
thoughts
the
conversation
of
the
past
half
hour
had
revived
but
not
generated;
tumultuous
were
they
now,
as
disturbed
bees
in
a
hive,
but
it
was
years
since
they
had
first
made
their
cells
in
her
brain.
She
was
reviewing
his
character,
his
disposition,
repeating
his
sentiments
on
marriage.
Many
a
time
had
she
reviewed
them
before,
and
sounded
the
gulf
between
her
own
mind
and
his;
and
then,
on
the
other
side
of
the
wide
and
deep
chasm,
she
had
seen,
and
she
now
saw,
another
figure
standing
beside
her
uncle's
a
strange
shape,
dim,
sinister,
scarcely
earthly
the
half
remembered
image
of
her
own
father,
James
Helstone,
Matthewson
Helstone's
brother.
Rumours
had
reached
her
ear
of
what
that
father's
character
was;
old
servants
had
dropped
hints;
she
knew,
too,
that
he
was
not
a
good
man,
and
that
he
was
never
kind
to
her.
She
recollected
a
dark
recollection
it
was
some
weeks
that
she
