the
walk.
"He
is
not
ugly,
Shirley,"
pleaded
Caroline;
"he
is
not
ignoble.
He
is
sad;
silence
seals
his
mind.
But
I
believe
him
to
be
intelligent;
and
be
certain,
if
he
had
not
something
very
commendable
in
his
disposition,
Mr.
Hall
would
never
seek
his
society
as
he
does."
Shirley
laughed;
she
laughed
again,
each
time
with
a
slightly
sarcastic
sound.
"Well,
well,"
was
her
comment.
"On
the
plea
of
the
man
being
Cyril
Hall's
friend
and
Robert
Moore's
brother,
we'll
just
tolerate
his
existence;
won't
we,
Cary?
You
believe
him
to
be
intelligent,
do
you?
Not
quite
an
idiot
eh?
Something
commendable
in
his
disposition!
id
est,
not
an
absolute
ruffian.
Good!
Your
representations
have
weight
with
me;
and
to
prove
that
they
have,
should
he
come
this
way
I
will
speak
to
him."
He
approached
the
summer
house.
Unconscious
that
it
was
tenanted,
he
sat
down
on
the
step.
Tartar,
now
his
customary
companion,
had
followed
him,
and
he
couched
across
his
feet.
"Old
boy!"
said
Louis,
pulling
his
tawny
ear,
or
rather
the
mutilated
remains
of
that
organ,
torn
and
chewed
in
a
hundred
battles,
"the
autumn
sun
shines
as
pleasantly
on
us
as
on
the
fairest
and
richest.
This
garden
is
none
of
ours,
but
we
enjoy
its
greenness
and
perfume,
don't
we?"
He
sat
silent,
still
caressing
Tartar,
who
slobbered
with
exceeding
affection.
A
faint
twittering
commenced
among
the
trees
round.
Something
fluttered
down
as
light
as
leaves.
They
were
little
birds,
which,
lighting
on
the
sward
at
shy
distance,
hopped
as
if
expectant.
"The
small
brown
elves
actually
remember
that
I
fed
them
the
other
day,"
again
soliloquized
Louis.
"They
want
some
more
biscuit.
To
day
I
forgot
to
save
a
fragment.
Eager
little
sprites,
I
have
not
a
crumb
for
you."
He
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
drew
it
out
empty.
"A
want
easily
supplied,"
whispered
the
listening
Miss
Keeldar.
She
took
from
her
reticule
a
morsel
of
sweet
cake;
for
that
repository
was
never
destitute
of
something
available
to
throw
to
the
chickens,
young
ducks,
or
sparrows.
She
crumbled
it,
and
bending
over
his
shoulder,
put
the
crumbs
into
his
hand.
"There,"
said
she
"there
is
a
providence
for
the
improvident."
"This
September
afternoon
is
pleasant,"
observed
Louis
Moore,
as,
not
at
all
discomposed,
he
calmly
cast
the
crumbs
on
to
the
grass.
"Even
for
you?"
"As
pleasant
for
me
as
for
any
monarch."
"You
take
a
sort
of
harsh,
solitary
triumph
in
drawing
pleasure
out
of
the
elements
and
the
inanimate
and
lower
animate
creation."
"Solitary,
but
not
harsh.
With
animals
I
feel
I
am
Adam's
son,
the
heir
of
him
to
whom
dominion
was
given
over
'every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth.'
Your
dog
likes
and
follows
me.
When
I
go
into
that
yard,
the
pigeons
from
your
dovecot
flutter
at
my
feet.
Your
mare
in
the
stable
knows
me
as
well
as
it
knows
you,
and
obeys
me
better."
"And
my
roses
smell
sweet
to
you,
and
my
trees
give
you
shade."
"And,"
continued
Louis,
"no
caprice
can
withdraw
these
pleasures
from
me;
they
are
mine."
He
walked
off.
Tartar
followed
him,
as
if
in
duty
and
affection
bound,
and
Shirley
remained
standing
on
the
summer
house
step.
Caroline
saw
her
face
as
she
looked
after
the
rude
tutor.
It
was
pale,
as
if
her
pride
bled
inwardly.
"You
see,"
remarked
Caroline
apologetically,
"his
feelings
are
so
often
hurt
it
makes
him
morose."
"You
see,"
retorted
Shirley,
with
ire,
"he
is
a
topic
on
which
you
and
I
shall
quarrel
if
we
discuss
it
often;
so
drop
it
henceforward
and
for
ever."
"I
suppose
he
has
more
than
once
behaved
in
this
way,"
thought
Caroline
to
herself,
"and
that
renders
Shirley
so
distant
to
him.
Yet
I
wonder
she
cannot
make
allowance
for
character
and
circumstances.
I
wonder
the
general
modesty,
manliness,
sincerity
of
his
nature
do
not
plead
with
her
in
his
behalf.
She
is
not
often
so
inconsiderate,
so
irritable."
The
verbal
testimony
of
two
friends
of
Caroline's
to
her
cousin's
character
augmented
her
favourable
opinion
of
him.
William
Farren,
whose
cottage
he
had
visited
in
company
with
Mr.
Hall,
pronounced
him
a
"real
gentleman;"
there
was
not
such
another
in
Briarfield.
He
William
"could
do
aught
for
that
man.
And
then
to
see
how
t'
bairns
liked
him,
and
how
t'
wife
took
to
him
first
minute
she
saw
him.
He
never
went
into
a
house
but
t'
childer
wor
about
him
directly.
Them
little
things
wor
like
as
if
they'd
a
keener
sense
nor
grown
up
folks
i'
finding
our
folk's
natures."
Mr.
Hall,
in
answer
to
a
question
of
Miss
Helstone's
as
to
what
he
thought
of
Louis
Moore,
replied
promptly
that
he
was
the
best
fellow
he
had
met
with
since
he
left
Cambridge.
"But
he
is
so
grave,"
objected
Caroline.
"Grave!
the
finest
company
in
the
world!
Full
of
odd,
quiet,
out
of
the
way
humour.
Never
enjoyed
an
excursion
so
much
in
my
life
as
the
one
I
took
with
him
to
the
Lakes.
His
understanding
and
tastes
are
so
superior,
it
does
a
man
good
to
be
within
their
influence;
and
as
to
his
temper
and
nature,
I
call
them
fine."
"At
Fieldhead
he
looks
gloomy,
and,
I
believe,
has
the
character
of
being
misanthropical."
"Oh!
I
fancy
he
is
rather
out
of
place
there
in
a
false
position.
The
Sympsons
are
most
estimable
people,
but
not
the
folks
to
comprehend
him.
They
think
a
great
deal
about
form
and
ceremony,
which
are
quite
out
of
Louis's
way."
"I
don't
think
Miss
Keeldar
likes
him."
"She
doesn't
know
him
she
doesn't
know
him;
otherwise
she
has
sense
enough
to
do
justice
to
his
merits."
"Well,
I
suppose
she
doesn't
know
him,"
mused
Caroline
to
herself,
and
by
this
hypothesis
she
endeavoured
to
account
for
what
seemed
else
unaccountable.
But
such
simple
solution
of
the
difficulty
was
not
left
her
long.
She
was
obliged
to
refuse
