drunk
by
the
roadside,
as
I
returned
from
Stilbro'
market;
and
while
you
preach
peace,
you
make
it
the
business
of
your
life
to
stir
up
dissension.
You
no
more
sympathize
with
the
poor
who
are
in
distress
than
you
sympathize
with
me.
You
incite
them
to
outrage
for
bad
purposes
of
your
own;
so
does
the
individual
called
Noah
of
Tim's.
You
two
are
restless,
meddling,
impudent
scoundrels,
whose
chief
motive
principle
is
a
selfish
ambition,
as
dangerous
as
it
is
puerile.
The
persons
behind
you
are
some
of
them
honest
though
misguided
men;
but
you
two
I
count
altogether
bad."
Barraclough
was
going
to
speak.
"Silence!
You
have
had
your
say,
and
now
I
will
have
mine.
As
to
being
dictated
to
by
you,
or
any
Jack,
Jem,
or
Jonathan
on
earth,
I
shall
not
suffer
it
for
a
moment.
You
desire
me
to
quit
the
country;
you
request
me
to
part
with
my
machinery.
In
case
I
refuse,
you
threaten
me.
I
do
refuse
point
blank!
Here
I
stay,
and
by
this
mill
I
stand,
and
into
it
will
I
convey
the
best
machinery
inventors
can
furnish.
What
will
you
do?
The
utmost
you
can
do
and
this
you
will
never
dare
to
do
is
to
burn
down
my
mill,
destroy
its
contents,
and
shoot
me.
What
then?
Suppose
that
building
was
a
ruin
and
I
was
a
corpse
what
then,
you
lads
behind
these
two
scamps?
Would
that
stop
invention
or
exhaust
science?
Not
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
of
time!
Another
and
better
gig
mill
would
rise
on
the
ruins
of
this,
and
perhaps
a
more
enterprising
owner
come
in
my
place.
Hear
me!
I'll
make
my
cloth
as
I
please,
and
according
to
the
best
lights
I
have.
In
its
manufacture
I
will
employ
what
means
I
choose.
Whoever,
after
hearing
this,
shall
dare
to
interfere
with
me
may
just
take
the
consequences.
An
example
shall
prove
I'm
in
earnest."
He
whistled
shrill
and
loud.
Sugden,
his
staff
and
warrant,
came
on
the
scene.
Moore
turned
sharply
to
Barraclough.
"You
were
at
Stilbro',"
said
he;
"I
have
proof
of
that.
You
were
on
the
moor,
you
wore
a
mask,
you
knocked
down
one
of
my
men
with
your
own
hand
you!
a
preacher
of
the
gospel!
Sugden,
arrest
him!"
Moses
was
captured.
There
was
a
cry
and
a
rush
to
rescue,
but
the
right
hand
which
all
this
while
had
lain
hidden
in
Moore's
breast,
reappearing,
held
out
a
pistol.
"Both
barrels
are
loaded,"
said
he.
"I'm
quite
determined!
Keep
off!"
Stepping
backwards,
facing
the
foe
as
he
went,
he
guarded
his
prey
to
the
counting
house.
He
ordered
Joe
Scott
to
pass
in
with
Sugden
and
the
prisoner,
and
to
bolt
the
door
inside.
For
himself,
he
walked
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
front
of
the
mill,
looking
meditatively
on
the
ground,
his
hand
hanging
carelessly
by
his
side,
but
still
holding
the
pistol.
The
eleven
remaining
deputies
watched
him
some
time,
talking
under
their
breath
to
each
other.
At
length
one
of
them
approached.
This
man
looked
very
different
from
either
of
the
two
who
had
previously
spoken;
he
was
hard
favoured,
but
modest
and
manly
looking.
"I've
not
much
faith
i'
Moses
Barraclough,"
said
he,
"and
I
would
speak
a
word
to
you
myseln,
Mr.
Moore.
It's
out
o'
no
ill
will
that
I'm
here,
for
my
part;
it's
just
to
mak
a
effort
to
get
things
straightened,
for
they're
sorely
a
crooked.
Ye
see
we're
ill
off
varry
ill
off;
wer
families
is
poor
and
pined.
We're
thrown
out
o'
work
wi'
these
frames;
we
can
get
nought
to
do;
we
can
earn
nought.
What
is
to
be
done?
Mun
we
say,
wisht!
and
lig
us
down
and
dee?
Nay;
I've
no
grand
words
at
my
tongue's
end,
Mr.
Moore,
but
I
feel
that
it
wad
be
a
low
principle
for
a
reasonable
man
to
starve
to
death
like
a
dumb
cratur.
I
willn't
do't.
I'm
not
for
shedding
blood:
I'd
neither
kill
a
man
nor
hurt
a
man;
and
I'm
not
for
pulling
down
mills
and
breaking
machines
for,
as
ye
say,
that
way
o'
going
on'll
niver
stop
invention;
but
I'll
talk
I'll
mak
as
big
a
din
as
ever
I
can.
Invention
may
be
all
right,
but
I
know
it
isn't
right
for
poor
folks
to
starve.
Them
that
governs
mun
find
a
way
to
help
us;
they
mun
make
fresh
orderations.
Ye'll
say
that's
hard
to
do.
So
mich
louder
mun
we
shout
out
then,
for
so
much
slacker
will
t'
Parliament
men
be
to
set
on
to
a
tough
job."
"Worry
the
Parliament
men
as
much
as
you
please,"
said
Moore;
"but
to
worry
the
mill
owners
is
absurd,
and
I
for
one
won't
stand
it."
"Ye're
a
raight
hard
un!"
returned
the
workman.
"Willn't
ye
gie
us
a
bit
o'
time?
Willn't
ye
consent
to
mak
your
changes
rather
more
slowly?"
"Am
I
the
whole
body
of
clothiers
in
Yorkshire?
Answer
me
that."
"Ye're
yourseln."
"And
only
myself.
And
if
I
stopped
by
the
way
an
instant,
while
others
are
rushing
on,
I
should
be
trodden
down.
If
I
did
as
you
wish
me
to
do,
I
should
be
bankrupt
in
a
month;
and
would
my
bankruptcy
put
bread
into
your
hungry
children's
mouths?
William
Farren,
neither
to
your
dictation
nor
to
that
of
any
other
will
I
submit.
Talk
to
me
no
more
about
machinery.
I
will
have
my
own
way.
I
shall
get
new
frames
in
to
morrow.
If
you
broke
these,
I
would
still
get
more.
I'll
never
give
in."
Here
the
mill
bell
rang
twelve
o'clock.
It
was
the
dinner
hour.
Moore
abruptly
turned
from
the
deputation
and
re
entered
his
counting
house.
His
last
words
had
left
a
bad,
harsh
impression;
he,
at
least,
had
"failed
in
the
disposing
of
a
chance
he
was
lord
of."
By
speaking
kindly
to
William
Farren
who
was
a
very
honest
man,
