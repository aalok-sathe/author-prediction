in
society,
attractive
female
society?
it
being
only
with
the
one
lady
of
his
own
family
that
he
maintained
a
grim
taciturnity
kept
up
a
brilliant
flow
of
easy
prattle
with
his
right
hand
and
left
hand
neighbours,
and
even
with
his
vis
a
vis,
Miss
Mary;
though,
as
Mary
was
the
most
sensible,
the
least
coquettish,
of
the
three,
to
her
the
elderly
widower
was
the
least
attentive.
At
heart
he
could
not
abide
sense
in
women.
He
liked
to
see
them
as
silly,
as
light
headed,
as
vain,
as
open
to
ridicule
as
possible,
because
they
were
then
in
reality
what
he
held
them
to
be,
and
wished
them
to
be
inferior,
toys
to
play
with,
to
amuse
a
vacant
hour,
and
to
be
thrown
away.
Hannah
was
his
favourite.
Harriet,
though
beautiful,
egotistical,
and
self
satisfied,
was
not
quite
weak
enough
for
him.
She
had
some
genuine
self
respect
amidst
much
false
pride,
and
if
she
did
not
talk
like
an
oracle,
neither
would
she
babble
like
one
crazy;
she
would
not
permit
herself
to
be
treated
quite
as
a
doll,
a
child,
a
plaything;
she
expected
to
be
bent
to
like
a
queen.
Hannah,
on
the
contrary,
demanded
no
respect,
only
flattery.
If
her
admirers
only
told
her
that
she
was
an
angel,
she
would
let
them
treat
her
like
an
idiot.
So
very
credulous
and
frivolous
was
she,
so
very
silly
did
she
become
when
besieged
with
attention,
flattered
and
admired
to
the
proper
degree,
that
there
were
moments
when
Helstone
actually
felt
tempted
to
commit
matrimony
a
second
time,
and
to
try
the
experiment
of
taking
her
for
his
second
helpmeet;
but
fortunately
the
salutary
recollection
of
the
ennuis
of
his
first
marriage,
the
impression
still
left
on
him
of
the
weight
of
the
millstone
he
had
once
worn
round
his
neck,
the
fixity
of
his
feelings
respecting
the
insufferable
evils
of
conjugal
existence,
operated
as
a
check
to
his
tenderness,
suppressed
the
sigh
heaving
his
old
iron
lungs,
and
restrained
him
from
whispering
to
Hannah
proposals
it
would
have
been
high
fun
and
great
satisfaction
to
her
to
hear.
It
is
probable
she
would
have
married
him
if
he
had
asked
her;
her
parents
would
have
quite
approved
the
match.
To
them
his
fifty
five
years,
his
bend
leather
heart,
could
have
presented
no
obstacles;
and
as
he
was
a
rector,
held
an
excellent
living,
occupied
a
good
house,
and
was
supposed
even
to
have
private
property
(though
in
that
the
world
was
mistaken;
every
penny
of
the
5,000
inherited
by
him
from
his
father
had
been
devoted
to
the
building
and
endowing
of
a
new
church
at
his
native
village
in
Lancashire
for
he
could
show
a
lordly
munificence
when
he
pleased,
and
if
the
end
was
to
his
liking,
never
hesitated
about
making
a
grand
sacrifice
to
attain
it)
her
parents,
I
say,
would
have
delivered
Hannah
over
to
his
lovingkindness
and
his
tender
mercies
without
one
scruple;
and
the
second
Mrs.
Helstone,
inverting
the
natural
order
of
insect
existence,
would
have
fluttered
through
the
honeymoon
a
bright,
admired
butterfly,
and
crawled
the
rest
of
her
days
a
sordid,
trampled
worm.
Little
Mr.
Sweeting,
seated
between
Mrs.
Sykes
and
Miss
Mary,
both
of
whom
were
very
kind
to
him,
and
having
a
dish
of
tarts
before
him,
and
marmalade
and
crumpet
upon
his
plate,
looked
and
felt
more
content
than
any
monarch.
He
was
fond
of
all
the
Misses
Sykes;
they
were
all
fond
of
him.
He
thought
them
magnificent
girls,
quite
proper
to
mate
with
one
of
his
inches.
If
he
had
a
cause
of
regret
at
this
blissful
moment,
it
was
that
Miss
Dora
happened
to
be
absent
Dora
being
the
one
whom
he
secretly
hoped
one
day
to
call
Mrs.
David
Sweeting,
with
whom
he
dreamt
of
taking
stately
walks,
leading
her
like
an
empress
through
the
village
of
Nunnely;
and
an
empress
she
would
have
been,
if
size
could
make
an
empress.
She
was
vast,
ponderous.
Seen
from
behind,
she
had
the
air
of
a
very
stout
lady
of
forty;
but
withal
she
possessed
a
good
face,
and
no
unkindly
character.
The
meal
at
last
drew
to
a
close.
It
would
have
been
over
long
ago
if
Mr.
Donne
had
not
persisted
in
sitting
with
his
cup
half
full
of
cold
tea
before
him,
long
after
the
rest
had
finished
and
after
he
himself
had
discussed
such
allowance
of
viands
as
he
felt
competent
to
swallow
long,
indeed,
after
signs
of
impatience
had
been
manifested
all
round
the
board,
till
chairs
were
pushed
back,
till
the
talk
flagged,
till
silence
fell.
Vainly
did
Caroline
inquire
repeatedly
if
he
would
have
another
cup,
if
he
would
take
a
little
hot
tea,
as
that
must
be
cold,
etc.;
he
would
neither
drink
it
nor
leave
it.
He
seemed
to
think
that
this
isolated
position
of
his
gave
him
somehow
a
certain
importance,
that
it
was
dignified
and
stately
to
be
the
last,
that
it
was
grand
to
keep
all
the
others
waiting.
So
long
did
he
linger,
that
the
very
urn
died;
it
ceased
to
hiss.
At
length,
however,
the
old
rector
himself,
who
had
hitherto
been
too
pleasantly
engaged
with
Hannah
to
care
for
the
delay,
got
impatient.
"For
whom
are
we
waiting?"
he
asked.
"For
me,
I
believe,"
returned
Donne
complacently,
appearing
to
think
it
much
to
his
credit
that
a
party
should
thus
be
kept
dependent
on
his
movements.
"Tut!"
cried
Helstone.
Then
standing
up,
"Let
us
return
thanks,"
said
he;
which
he
did
forthwith,
and
all
quitted
the
table.
Donne,
nothing
abashed,
still
sat
ten
minutes
quite
alone,
whereupon
Mr.
Helstone
rang
the
bell
for
the
things
to
be
removed.
The
curate
at
length
saw
himself
forced
to
empty
his
cup,
and
to
relinquish
the
role
which,
he
thought,
had
given
him
such
a
felicitous
distinction,
drawing
upon
him
such
flattering
general
notice.
And
now,
in
the
natural
course
of
events
(Caroline,
knowing
how
