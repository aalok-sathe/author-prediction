and
we'll
keep
him.
But
mind,
Rose,
he's
not
so
much
your
friend
as
he
is
mine.
He
is
my
particular
acquaintance;
remember
that!"
And
she
held
up
her
small
hand
with
an
admonitory
gesture.
Rose
was
quite
accustomed
to
be
admonished
by
that
small
hand.
Her
will
daily
bent
itself
to
that
of
the
impetuous
little
Jessy.
She
was
guided,
overruled
by
Jessy
in
a
thousand
things.
On
all
occasions
of
show
and
pleasure
Jessy
took
the
lead,
and
Rose
fell
quietly
into
the
background;
whereas,
when
the
disagreeables
of
life
its
work
and
privations
were
in
question,
Rose
instinctively
took
upon
her,
in
addition
to
her
own
share,
what
she
could
of
her
sister's.
Jessy
had
already
settled
it
in
her
mind
that
she,
when
she
was
old
enough,
was
to
be
married;
Rose,
she
decided,
must
be
an
old
maid,
to
live
with
her,
look
after
her
children,
keep
her
house.
This
state
of
things
is
not
uncommon
between
two
sisters,
where
one
is
plain
and
the
other
pretty;
but
in
this
case,
if
there
was
a
difference
in
external
appearance,
Rose
had
the
advantage:
her
face
was
more
regular
featured
than
that
of
the
piquant
little
Jessy.
Jessy,
however,
was
destined
to
possess,
along
with
sprightly
intelligence
and
vivacious
feeling,
the
gift
of
fascination,
the
power
to
charm
when,
where,
and
whom
she
would.
Rose
was
to
have
a
fine,
generous
soul,
a
noble
intellect
profoundly
cultivated,
a
heart
as
true
as
steel,
but
the
manner
to
attract
was
not
to
be
hers.
"Now,
Rose,
tell
me
the
name
of
this
lady
who
denied
that
I
was
sentimental,"
urged
Mr.
Moore.
Rose
had
no
idea
of
tantalization,
or
she
would
have
held
him
a
while
in
doubt.
She
answered
briefly,
"I
can't.
I
don't
know
her
name."
"Describe
her
to
me.
What
was
she
like?
Where
did
you
see
her?"
"When
Jessy
and
I
went
to
spend
the
day
at
Whinbury
with
Kate
and
Susan
Pearson,
who
were
just
come
home
from
school,
there
was
a
party
at
Mrs.
Pearson's,
and
some
grown
up
ladies
were
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
drawing
room
talking
about
you."
"Did
you
know
none
of
them?"
"Hannah,
and
Harriet,
and
Dora,
and
Mary
Sykes."
"Good.
Were
they
abusing
me,
Rosy?"
"Some
of
them
were.
They
called
you
a
misanthrope.
I
remember
the
word.
I
looked
for
it
in
the
dictionary
when
I
came
home.
It
means
a
man
hater."
"What
besides?"
"Hannah
Sykes
said
you
were
a
solemn
puppy."
"Better!"
cried
Mr.
Yorke,
laughing.
"Oh,
excellent!
Hannah!
that's
the
one
with
the
red
hair
a
fine
girl,
but
half
witted."
"She
has
wit
enough
for
me,
it
appears,"
said
Moore.
"A
solemn
puppy,
indeed!
Well,
Rose,
go
on."
"Miss
Pearson
said
she
believed
there
was
a
good
deal
of
affectation
about
you,
and
that
with
your
dark
hair
and
pale
face
you
looked
to
her
like
some
sort
of
a
sentimental
noodle."
Again
Mr.
Yorke
laughed.
Mrs.
Yorke
even
joined
in
this
time.
"You
see
in
what
esteem
you
are
held
behind
your
back,"
said
she;
"yet
I
believe
that
Miss
Pearson
would
like
to
catch
you.
She
set
her
cap
at
you
when
you
first
came
into
the
country,
old
as
she
is."
"And
who
contradicted
her,
Rosy?"
inquired
Moore.
"A
lady
whom
I
don't
know,
because
she
never
visits
here,
though
I
see
her
every
Sunday
at
church.
She
sits
in
the
pew
near
the
pulpit.
I
generally
look
at
her,
instead
of
looking
at
my
prayer
book,
for
she
is
like
a
picture
in
our
dining
room,
that
woman
with
the
dove
in
her
hand
at
least
she
has
eyes
like
it,
and
a
nose
too,
a
straight
nose,
that
makes
all
her
face
look,
somehow,
what
I
call
clear."
"And
you
don't
know
her!"
exclaimed
Jessy,
in
a
tone
of
exceeding
surprise.
"That's
so
like
Rose.
Mr.
Moore,
I
often
wonder
in
what
sort
of
a
world
my
sister
lives.
I
am
sure
she
does
not
live
all
her
time
in
this.
One
is
continually
finding
out
that
she
is
quite
ignorant
of
some
little
matter
which
everybody
else
knows.
To
think
of
her
going
solemnly
to
church
every
Sunday,
and
looking
all
service
time
at
one
particular
person,
and
never
so
much
as
asking
that
person's
name.
She
means
Caroline
Helstone,
the
rector's
niece.
I
remember
all
about
it.
Miss
Helstone
was
quite
angry
with
Anne
Pearson.
She
said,
'Robert
Moore
is
neither
affected
nor
sentimental;
you
mistake
his
character
utterly,
or
rather
not
one
of
you
here
knows
anything
about
it.'
Now,
shall
I
tell
you
what
she
is
like?
I
can
tell
what
people
are
like,
and
how
they
are
dressed,
better
than
Rose
can."
"Let
us
hear."
"She
is
nice;
she
is
fair;
she
has
a
pretty
white
slender
throat;
she
has
long
curls,
not
stiff
ones
they
hang
loose
and
soft,
their
colour
is
brown
but
not
dark;
she
speaks
quietly,
with
a
clear
tone;
she
never
makes
a
bustle
in
moving;
she
often
wears
a
gray
silk
dress;
she
is
neat
all
over
her
gowns,
and
her
shoes,
and
her
gloves
always
fit
her.
She
is
what
I
call
a
lady,
and
when
I
am
as
tall
as
she
is,
I
mean
to
be
like
her.
Shall
I
suit
you
if
I
am?
Will
you
really
marry
me?"
Moore
stroked
Jessy's
hair.
For
a
minute
he
seemed
as
if
he
would
draw
her
nearer
to
him,
but
instead
he
put
her
a
little
farther
off.
"Oh!
you
won't
have
me?
You
push
me
away."
"Why,
Jessy,
you
care
nothing
about
me.
You
never
come
to
see
me
now
at
the
Hollow."
"Because
you
don't
ask
me."
Hereupon
Mr.
Moore
gave
both
the
little
girls
an
invitation
to
pay
him
a
visit
next
day,
promising
that,
as
he
was
going
to
Stilbro'
in
the
morning,
he
would
buy
them
each
a
present,
of
what
nature
he
would
not
then
declare,
