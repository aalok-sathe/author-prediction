the
delicious
worldly
fuss
should
pompously
begin.
At
last
there
came
a
letter.
He
himself
handed
it
to
Miss
Keeldar
out
of
the
bag.
He
knew
the
handwriting;
he
knew
the
crest
on
the
seal.
He
did
not
see
it
opened
and
read,
for
Shirley
took
it
to
her
own
room;
nor
did
he
see
it
answered,
for
she
wrote
her
reply
shut
up,
and
was
very
long
about
it
the
best
part
of
a
day.
He
questioned
her
whether
it
was
answered;
she
responded,
"Yes."
Again
he
waited
waited
in
silence,
absolutely
not
daring
to
speak,
kept
mute
by
something
in
Shirley's
face
a
very
awful
something
inscrutable
to
him
as
the
writing
on
the
wall
to
Belshazzar.
He
was
moved
more
than
once
to
call
Daniel,
in
the
person
of
Louis
Moore,
and
to
ask
an
interpretation;
but
his
dignity
forbade
the
familiarity.
Daniel
himself,
perhaps,
had
his
own
private
difficulties
connected
with
that
baffling
bit
of
translation;
he
looked
like
a
student
for
whom
grammars
are
blank
and
dictionaries
dumb.
Mr.
Sympson
had
been
out,
to
while
away
an
anxious
hour
in
the
society
of
his
friends
at
De
Walden
Hall.
He
returned
a
little
sooner
than
was
expected.
His
family
and
Miss
Keeldar
were
assembled
in
the
oak
parlour.
Addressing
the
latter,
he
requested
her
to
step
with
him
into
another
room.
He
wished
to
have
with
her
a
"strictly
private
interview."
She
rose,
asking
no
questions
and
professing
no
surprise.
"Very
well,
sir,"
she
said,
in
the
tone
of
a
determined
person
who
is
informed
that
the
dentist
is
come
to
extract
that
large
double
tooth
of
his,
from
which
he
has
suffered
such
a
purgatory
this
month
past.
She
left
her
sewing
and
her
thimble
in
the
window
seat,
and
followed
her
uncle
where
he
led.
Shut
into
the
drawing
room,
the
pair
took
seats,
each
in
an
arm
chair,
placed
opposite,
a
few
yards
between
them.
"I
have
been
to
De
Walden
Hall,"
said
Mr.
Sympson.
He
paused.
Miss
Keeldar's
eyes
were
on
the
pretty
white
and
green
carpet.
That
information
required
no
response.
She
gave
none.
"I
have
learned,"
he
went
on
slowly
"I
have
learned
a
circumstance
which
surprises
me."
Resting
her
cheek
on
her
forefinger,
she
waited
to
be
told
what
circumstance.
"It
seems
that
Nunnely
Priory
is
shut
up
that
the
family
are
gone
back
to
their
place
in
shire.
It
seems
that
the
baronet
that
the
baronet
that
Sir
Philip
himself
has
accompanied
his
mother
and
sisters."
"Indeed!"
said
Shirley.
"May
I
ask
if
you
share
the
amazement
with
which
I
received
this
news?"
"No,
sir."
"Is
it
news
to
you?"
"Yes,
sir."
"I
mean
I
mean,"
pursued
Mr.
Sympson,
now
fidgeting
in
his
chair,
quitting
his
hitherto
brief
and
tolerably
clear
phraseology,
and
returning
to
his
customary
wordy,
confused,
irritable
style
"I
mean
to
have
a
thorough
explanation.
I
will
not
be
put
off.
I
I
shall
insist
on
being
heard,
and
on
on
having
my
own
way.
My
questions
must
be
answered.
I
will
have
clear,
satisfactory
replies.
I
am
not
to
be
trifled
with.
(Silence.)
"It
is
a
strange
and
an
extraordinary
thing
a
very
singular
a
most
odd
thing!
I
thought
all
was
right,
knew
no
other;
and
there
the
family
are
gone!"
"I
suppose,
sir,
they
had
a
right
to
go."
"Sir
Philip
is
gone!"
(with
emphasis).
Shirley
raised
her
brows.
"Bon
voyage!"
said
she.
"This
will
not
do;
this
must
be
altered,
ma'am."
He
drew
his
chair
forward;
he
pushed
it
back;
he
looked
perfectly
incensed,
and
perfectly
helpless.
"Come,
come
now,
uncle,"
expostulated
Shirley,
"do
not
begin
to
fret
and
fume,
or
we
shall
make
no
sense
of
the
business.
Ask
me
what
you
want
to
know.
I
am
as
willing
to
come
to
an
explanation
as
you.
I
promise
you
truthful
replies."
"I
want
I
demand
to
know,
Miss
Keeldar,
whether
Sir
Philip
has
made
you
an
offer?"
"He
has."
"You
avow
it?"
"I
avow
it.
But
now,
go
on.
Consider
that
point
settled."
"He
made
you
an
offer
that
night
we
dined
at
the
priory?"
"It
is
enough
to
say
that
he
made
it.
Go
on."
"He
proposed
in
the
recess
in
the
room
that
used
to
be
a
picture
gallery
that
Sir
Monckton
converted
into
it
saloon?"
No
answer.
"You
were
both
examining
a
cabinet.
I
saw
it
all.
My
sagacity
was
not
at
fault
it
never
is.
Subsequently
you
received
a
letter
from
him.
On
what
subject
of
what
nature
were
the
contents?"
"No
matter."
"Ma'am,
is
that
the
way
in
which
you
speak
to
me?"
Shirley's
foot
tapped
quick
on
the
carpet.
"There
you
sit,
silent
and
sullen
you
who
promised
truthful
replies."
"Sir,
I
have
answered
you
thus
far.
Proceed."
"I
should
like
to
see
that
letter."
"You
cannot
see
it."
"I
must
and
shall,
ma'am;
I
am
your
guardian."
"Having
ceased
to
be
a
ward,
I
have
no
guardian."
"Ungrateful
being!
Reared
by
me
as
my
own
daughter
"
"Once
more,
uncle,
have
the
kindness
to
keep
to
the
point.
Let
us
both
remain
cool.
For
my
part,
I
do
not
wish
to
get
into
a
passion;
but,
you
know,
once
drive
me
beyond
certain
bounds,
I
care
little
what
I
say
I
am
not
then
soon
checked.
Listen!
You
have
asked
me
whether
Sir
Philip
made
me
an
offer.
That
question
is
answered.
What
do
you
wish
to
know
next?"
"I
desire
to
know
whether
you
accepted
or
refused
him,
and
know
it
I
will."
"Certainly,
you
ought
to
know
it.
I
refused
him."
"Refused
him!
You
you,
Shirley
Keeldar,
refused
Sir
Philip
Nunnely?"
"I
did."
The
poor
gentleman
bounced
from
his
chair,
and
first
rushed
and
then
trotted
through
the
room.
"There
it
is!
There
it
is!
There
it
is!"
"Sincerely
speaking,
I
am
sorry,
uncle,
you
are
so
disappointed."
Concession,
contrition,
never
do
any
good
with
some
people.
Instead
of
softening
and
conciliating,
they
but
embolden
and
harden
them.
Of
that
