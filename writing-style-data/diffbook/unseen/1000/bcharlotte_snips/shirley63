and
affection.
To
this
extenuated
spectre,
perhaps,
a
crumb
is
not
thrown
once
a
year,
but
when
ahungered
and
athirst
to
famine
when
all
humanity
has
forgotten
the
dying
tenant
of
a
decaying
house
Divine
mercy
remembers
the
mourner,
and
a
shower
of
manna
falls
for
lips
that
earthly
nutriment
is
to
pass
no
more.
Biblical
promises,
heard
first
in
health,
but
then
unheeded,
come
whispering
to
the
couch
of
sickness;
it
is
felt
that
a
pitying
God
watches
what
all
mankind
have
forsaken.
The
tender
compassion
of
Jesus
is
recalled
and
relied
on;
the
faded
eye,
gazing
beyond
time,
sees
a
home,
a
friend,
a
refuge
in
eternity.
Miss
Mann,
drawn
on
by
the
still
attention
of
her
listener,
proceeded
to
allude
to
circumstances
in
her
past
life.
She
spoke
like
one
who
tells
the
truth
simply,
and
with
a
certain
reserve;
she
did
not
boast,
nor
did
she
exaggerate.
Caroline
found
that
the
old
maid
had
been
a
most
devoted
daughter
and
sister,
an
unwearied
watcher
by
lingering
deathbeds;
that
to
prolonged
and
unrelaxing
attendance
on
the
sick
the
malady
that
now
poisoned
her
own
life
owed
its
origin;
that
to
one
wretched
relative
she
had
been
a
support
and
succour
in
the
depths
of
self
earned
degradation,
and
that
it
was
still
her
hand
which
kept
him
from
utter
destitution.
Miss
Helstone
stayed
the
whole
evening,
omitting
to
pay
her
other
intended
visit;
and
when
she
left
Miss
Mann
it
was
with
the
determination
to
try
in
future
to
excuse
her
faults;
never
again
to
make
light
of
her
peculiarities
or
to
laugh
at
her
plainness;
and,
above
all
things,
not
to
neglect
her,
but
to
come
once
a
week,
and
to
offer
her,
from
one
human
heart
at
least,
the
homage
of
affection
and
respect.
She
felt
she
could
now
sincerely
give
her
a
small
tribute
of
each
feeling.
Caroline,
on
her
return,
told
Fanny
she
was
very
glad
she
had
gone
out,
as
she
felt
much
better
for
the
visit.
The
next
day
she
failed
not
to
seek
Miss
Ainley.
This
lady
was
in
narrower
circumstances
than
Miss
Mann,
and
her
dwelling
was
more
humble.
It
was,
however,
if
possible,
yet
more
exquisitely
clean,
though
the
decayed
gentlewoman
could
not
afford
to
keep
a
servant,
but
waited
on
herself,
and
had
only
the
occasional
assistance
of
a
little
girl
who
lived
in
a
cottage
near.
Not
only
was
Miss
Ainley
poorer,
but
she
was
even
plainer
than
the
other
old
maid.
In
her
first
youth
she
must
have
been
ugly;
now,
at
the
age
of
fifty,
she
was
very
ugly.
At
first
sight,
all
but
peculiarly
well
disciplined
minds
were
apt
to
turn
from
her
with
annoyance,
to
conceive
against
her
a
prejudice,
simply
on
the
ground
of
her
unattractive
look.
Then
she
was
prim
in
dress
and
manner;
she
looked,
spoke,
and
moved
the
complete
old
maid.
Her
welcome
to
Caroline
was
formal,
even
in
its
kindness
for
it
was
kind;
but
Miss
Helstone
excused
this.
She
knew
something
of
the
benevolence
of
the
heart
which
beat
under
that
starched
kerchief;
all
the
neighbourhood
at
least
all
the
female
neighbourhood
knew
something
of
it.
No
one
spoke
against
Miss
Ainley
except
lively
young
gentlemen
and
inconsiderate
old
ones,
who
declared
her
hideous.
Caroline
was
soon
at
home
in
that
tiny
parlour.
A
kind
hand
took
from
her
her
shawl
and
bonnet,
and
installed
her
in
the
most
comfortable
seat
near
the
fire.
The
young
and
the
antiquated
woman
were
presently
deep
in
kindly
conversation,
and
soon
Caroline
became
aware
of
the
power
a
most
serene,
unselfish,
and
benignant
mind
could
exercise
over
those
to
whom
it
was
developed.
She
talked
never
of
herself,
always
of
others.
Their
faults
she
passed
over.
Her
theme
was
their
wants,
which
she
sought
to
supply;
their
sufferings,
which
she
longed
to
alleviate.
She
was
religious,
a
professor
of
religion
what
some
would
call
"a
saint;"
and
she
referred
to
religion
often
in
sanctioned
phrase
in
phrase
which
those
who
possess
a
perception
of
the
ridiculous,
without
owning
the
power
of
exactly
testing
and
truly
judging
character,
would
certainly
have
esteemed
a
proper
subject
for
satire,
a
matter
for
mimicry
and
laughter.
They
would
have
been
hugely
mistaken
for
their
pains.
Sincerity
is
never
ludicrous;
it
is
always
respectable.
Whether
truth
be
it
religious
or
moral
truth
speak
eloquently
and
in
well
chosen
language
or
not,
its
voice
should
be
heard
with
reverence.
Let
those
who
cannot
nicely,
and
with
certainty,
discern
the
difference
between
the
tones
of
hypocrisy
and
those
of
sincerity,
never
presume
to
laugh
at
all,
lest
they
should
have
the
miserable
misfortune
to
laugh
in
the
wrong
place,
and
commit
impiety
when
they
think
they
are
achieving
wit.
Not
from
Miss
Ainley's
own
lips
did
Caroline
hear
of
her
good
works,
but
she
knew
much
of
them
nevertheless.
Her
beneficence
was
the
familiar
topic
of
the
poor
in
Briarfield.
They
were
not
works
of
almsgiving.
The
old
maid
was
too
poor
to
give
much,
though
she
straitened
herself
to
privation
that
she
might
contribute
her
mite
when
needful.
They
were
the
works
of
a
Sister
of
Charity
far
more
difficult
to
perform
than
those
of
a
Lady
Bountiful.
She
would
watch
by
any
sick
bed;
she
seemed
to
fear
no
disease.
She
would
nurse
the
poorest
whom
none
else
would
nurse.
She
was
serene,
humble,
kind,
and
equable
through
everything.
For
this
goodness
she
got
but
little
reward
in
this
life.
Many
of
the
poor
became
so
accustomed
to
her
services
that
they
hardly
thanked
her
for
them.
The
rich
heard
them
mentioned
with
wonder,
but
were
silent,
from
a
sense
of
shame
at
the
difference
between
her
sacrifices
and
their
own.
Many
ladies,
however,
respected
her
deeply.
They
could
not
help
it.
One
gentleman
one
only
gave
her
his
friendship
and
perfect
confidence.
This
was
Mr.
Hall,
the
vicar
of
Nunnely.
He
said,
and
said
truly,
that
her
life
came
nearer
the
life
of
