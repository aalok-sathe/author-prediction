developed
to
excellence.
I
esteem
and
approve
my
child
as
highly
as
I
do
most
fondly
love
her."
"Is
what
I
hear
true?
Is
it
no
dream?"
"I
wish
it
were
as
true
that
the
substance
and
colour
of
health
were
restored
to
your
cheek."
"My
own
mother!
is
she
one
I
can
be
so
fond
of
as
I
can
of
you?
People
generally
did
not
like
her
so
I
have
been
given
to
understand."
"They
told
you
that?
Well,
your
mother
now
tells
you
that,
not
having
the
gift
to
please
people
generally,
for
their
approbation
she
does
not
care.
Her
thoughts
are
centred
in
her
child.
Does
that
child
welcome
or
reject
her?"
"But
if
you
are
my
mother,
the
world
is
all
changed
to
me.
Surely
I
can
live.
I
should
like
to
recover
"
"You
must
recover.
You
drew
life
and
strength
from
my
breast
when
you
were
a
tiny,
fair
infant,
over
whose
blue
eyes
I
used
to
weep,
fearing
I
beheld
in
your
very
beauty
the
sign
of
qualities
that
had
entered
my
heart
like
iron,
and
pierced
through
my
soul
like
a
sword.
Daughter!
we
have
been
long
parted;
I
return
now
to
cherish
you
again."
She
held
her
to
her
bosom;
she
cradled
her
in
her
arms;
she
rocked
her
softly,
as
if
lulling
a
young
child
to
sleep.
"My
mother
my
own
mother!"
The
offspring
nestled
to
the
parent;
that
parent,
feeling
the
endearment
and
hearing
the
appeal,
gathered
her
closer
still.
She
covered
her
with
noiseless
kisses;
she
murmured
love
over
her,
like
a
cushat
fostering
its
young.
There
was
silence
in
the
room
for
a
long
while.
"Does
my
uncle
know?"
"Your
uncle
knows.
I
told
him
when
I
first
came
to
stay
with
you
here."
"Did
you
recognize
me
when
we
first
met
at
Fieldhead?"
"How
could
it
be
otherwise?
Mr.
and
Miss
Helstone
being
announced,
I
was
prepared
to
see
my
child."
"It
was
that,
then,
which
moved
you.
I
saw
you
disturbed."
"You
saw
nothing,
Caroline;
I
can
cover
my
feelings.
You
can
never
tell
what
an
age
of
strange
sensation
I
lived,
during
the
two
minutes
that
elapsed
between
the
report
of
your
name
and
your
entrance.
You
can
never
tell
how
your
look,
mien,
carriage,
shook
me."
"Why?
Were
you
disappointed?"
"What
will
she
be
like?
I
had
asked
myself;
and
when
I
saw
what
you
were
like,
I
could
have
dropped."
"Mamma,
why?"
"I
trembled
in
your
presence.
I
said,
I
will
never
own
her;
she
shall
never
know
me."
"But
I
said
and
did
nothing
remarkable.
I
felt
a
little
diffident
at
the
thought
of
an
introduction
to
strangers
that
was
all."
"I
soon
saw
you
were
diffident.
That
was
the
first
thing
which
reassured
me.
Had
you
been
rustic,
clownish,
awkward,
I
should
have
been
content."
"You
puzzle
me."
"I
had
reason
to
dread
a
fair
outside,
to
mistrust
a
popular
bearing,
to
shudder
before
distinction,
grace,
and
courtesy.
Beauty
and
affability
had
come
in
my
way
when
I
was
recluse,
desolate,
young,
and
ignorant
a
toil
worn
governess
perishing
of
uncheered
labour,
breaking
down
before
her
time.
These,
Caroline,
when
they
smiled
on
me,
I
mistook
for
angels.
I
followed
them
home;
and
when
into
their
hands
I
had
given
without
reserve
my
whole
chance
of
future
happiness,
it
was
my
lot
to
witness
a
transfiguration
on
the
domestic
hearth
to
see
the
white
mask
lifted,
the
bright
disguise
put
away,
and
opposite
me
sat
down
O
God,
I
have
suffered!"
She
sank
on
the
pillow.
"I
have
suffered!
None
saw
none
knew.
There
was
no
sympathy,
no
redemption,
no
redress!"
"Take
comfort,
mother.
It
is
over
now."
"It
is
over,
and
not
fruitlessly.
I
tried
to
keep
the
word
of
His
patience.
He
kept
me
in
the
days
of
my
anguish.
I
was
afraid
with
terror
I
was
troubled.
Through
great
tribulation
He
brought
me
through
to
a
salvation
revealed
in
this
last
time.
My
fear
had
torment;
He
has
cast
it
out.
He
has
given
me
in
its
stead
perfect
love.
But,
Caroline
"
Thus
she
invoked
her
daughter
after
a
pause.
"Mother!"
"I
charge
you,
when
you
next
look
on
your
father's
monument,
to
respect
the
name
chiselled
there.
To
you
he
did
only
good.
On
you
he
conferred
his
whole
treasure
of
beauties,
nor
added
to
them
one
dark
defect.
All
you
derived
from
him
is
excellent.
You
owe
him
gratitude.
Leave,
between
him
and
me,
the
settlement
of
our
mutual
account.
Meddle
not.
God
is
the
arbiter.
This
world's
laws
never
came
near
us
never!
They
were
powerless
as
a
rotten
bulrush
to
protect
me
impotent
as
idiot
babblings
to
restrain
him!
As
you
said,
it
is
all
over
now;
the
grave
lies
between
us.
There
he
sleeps,
in
that
church.
To
his
dust
I
say
this
night,
what
I
have
never
said
before,
'James,
slumber
peacefully!
See!
your
terrible
debt
is
cancelled!
Look!
I
wipe
out
the
long,
black
account
with
my
own
hand!
James,
your
child
atones.
This
living
likeness
of
you
this
thing
with
your
perfect
features
this
one
good
gift
you
gave
me
has
nestled
affectionately
to
my
heart,
and
tenderly
called
me
"mother."
Husband,
rest
forgiven!'"
"Dearest
mother,
that
is
right!
Can
papa's
spirit
hear
us?
Is
he
comforted
to
know
that
we
still
love
him?"
"I
said
nothing
of
love.
I
spoke
of
forgiveness.
Mind
the
truth,
child;
I
said
nothing
of
love!
On
the
threshold
of
eternity,
should
he
be
there
to
see
me
enter,
will
I
maintain
that."
"O
mother,
you
must
have
suffered!"
"O
child,
the
human
heart
can
suffer!
It
can
hold
more
tears
than
the
ocean
holds
waters.
We
never
know
how
deep,
how
wide
it
is,
till
misery
begins
to
unbind
her
clouds,
and
fill
it
with
rushing
blackness."
"Mother,
forget."
"Forget!"
she
said,
with
the
strangest
spectre
of
a
laugh.
"The
north
pole
will
rush
to
the
south,
and
the
headlands
of
