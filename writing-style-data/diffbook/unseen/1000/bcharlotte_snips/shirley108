Armitage
and
Ramsden,
gathered
in
such
a
close
circle
round
them?
And
why
is
Malone
beckoned
to
join
them?
Where
he
is
summoned,
be
sure
a
strong
arm
is
needed."
Shirley,
as
she
watched,
grew
restless;
her
eyes
flashed.
"They
won't
trust
me,"
she
said.
"That
is
always
the
way
when
it
comes
to
the
point."
"What
about?"
"Cannot
you
feel?
There
is
some
mystery
afloat;
some
event
is
expected;
some
preparation
is
to
be
made,
I
am
certain.
I
saw
it
all
in
Mr.
Moore's
manner
this
evening.
He
was
excited,
yet
hard."
"Hard
to
you,
Shirley?"
"Yes,
to
me.
He
often
is
hard
to
me.
We
seldom
converse
tete
a
tete
but
I
am
made
to
feel
that
the
basis
of
his
character
is
not
of
eider
down."
"Yet
he
seemed
to
talk
to
you
softly."
"Did
he
not?
Very
gentle
tones
and
quiet
manner.
Yet
the
man
is
peremptory
and
secret:
his
secrecy
vexes
me."
"Yes,
Robert
is
secret."
"Which
he
has
scarcely
a
right
to
be
with
me,
especially
as
he
commenced
by
giving
me
his
confidence.
Having
done
nothing
to
forfeit
that
confidence,
it
ought
not
to
be
withdrawn;
but
I
suppose
I
am
not
considered
iron
souled
enough
to
be
trusted
in
a
crisis."
"He
fears,
probably,
to
occasion
you
uneasiness."
"An
unnecessary
precaution.
I
am
of
elastic
materials,
not
soon
crushed.
He
ought
to
know
that.
But
the
man
is
proud.
He
has
his
faults,
say
what
you
will,
Lina.
Observe
how
engaged
that
group
appear.
They
do
not
know
we
are
watching
them."
"If
we
keep
on
the
alert,
Shirley,
we
shall
perhaps
find
the
clue
to
their
secret."
"There
will
be
some
unusual
movements
ere
long
perhaps
to
morrow,
possibly
to
night.
But
my
eyes
and
ears
are
wide
open.
Mr.
Moore,
you
shall
be
under
surveillance.
Be
you
vigilant
also,
Lina."
"I
will.
Robert
is
going;
I
saw
him
turn.
I
believe
he
noticed
us.
They
are
shaking
hands."
"Shaking
hands,
with
emphasis,"
added
Shirley,
"as
if
they
were
ratifying
some
solemn
league
and
covenant."
They
saw
Robert
quit
the
group,
pass
through
a
gate,
and
disappear.
"And
he
has
not
bid
us
good
bye,"
murmured
Caroline.
Scarcely
had
the
words
escaped
her
lips
when
she
tried
by
a
smile
to
deny
the
confession
of
disappointment
they
seemed
to
imply.
An
unbidden
suffusion
for
one
moment
both
softened
and
brightened
her
eyes.
"Oh,
that
is
soon
remedied!"
exclaimed
Shirley:
"we'll
make
him
bid
us
good
bye."
"Make
him!
That
is
not
the
same
thing,"
was
the
answer.
"It
shall
be
the
same
thing."
"But
he
is
gone;
you
can't
overtake
him."
"I
know
a
shorter
way
than
that
he
has
taken.
We
will
intercept
him."
"But,
Shirley,
I
would
rather
not
go."
Caroline
said
this
as
Miss
Keeldar
seized
her
arm
and
hurried
her
down
the
fields.
It
was
vain
to
contend.
Nothing
was
so
wilful
as
Shirley
when
she
took
a
whim
into
her
head.
Caroline
found
herself
out
of
sight
of
the
crowd
almost
before
she
was
aware,
and
ushered
into
a
narrow
shady
spot,
embowered
above
with
hawthorns,
and
enamelled
under
foot
with
daisies.
She
took
no
notice
of
the
evening
sun
chequering
the
turf,
nor
was
she
sensible
of
the
pure
incense
exhaling
at
this
hour
from
tree
and
plant;
she
only
heard
the
wicket
opening
at
one
end,
and
knew
Robert
was
approaching.
The
long
sprays
of
the
hawthorns,
shooting
out
before
them,
served
as
a
screen.
They
saw
him
before
he
observed
them.
At
a
glance
Caroline
perceived
that
his
social
hilarity
was
gone;
he
had
left
it
behind
him
in
the
joy
echoing
fields
round
the
school.
What
remained
now
was
his
dark,
quiet,
business
countenance.
As
Shirley
had
said,
a
certain
hardness
characterized
his
air,
while
his
eye
was
excited,
but
austere.
So
much
the
worse
timed
was
the
present
freak
of
Shirley's.
If
he
had
looked
disposed
for
holiday
mirth,
it
would
not
have
mattered
much;
but
now
"I
told
you
not
to
come,"
said
Caroline,
somewhat
bitterly,
to
her
friend.
She
seemed
truly
perturbed.
To
be
intruded
on
Robert
thus,
against
her
will
and
his
expectation,
and
when
he
evidently
would
rather
not
be
delayed,
keenly
annoyed
her.
It
did
not
annoy
Miss
Keeldar
in
the
least.
She
stepped
forward
and
faced
her
tenant,
barring
his
way.
"You
omitted
to
bid
us
good
bye,"
she
said.
"Omitted
to
bid
you
good
bye!
Where
did
you
come
from?
Are
you
fairies?
I
left
two
like
you,
one
in
purple
and
one
in
white,
standing
at
the
top
of
a
bank,
four
fields
off,
but
a
minute
ago."
"You
left
us
there
and
find
us
here.
We
have
been
watching
you,
and
shall
watch
you
still.
You
must
be
questioned
one
day,
but
not
now.
At
present
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
say
good
night,
and
then
pass."
Moore
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
without
unbending
his
aspect.
"Days
of
fete
have
their
privileges,
and
so
have
days
of
hazard,"
observed
he
gravely.
"Come,
don't
moralize.
Say
good
night,
and
pass,"
urged
Shirley.
"Must
I
say
good
night
to
you,
Miss
Keeldar?"
"Yes,
and
to
Caroline
likewise.
It
is
nothing
new,
I
hope.
You
have
bid
us
both
good
night
before."
He
took
her
hand,
held
it
in
one
of
his,
and
covered
it
with
the
other.
He
looked
down
at
her
gravely,
kindly,
yet
commandingly.
The
heiress
could
not
make
this
man
her
subject.
In
his
gaze
on
her
bright
face
there
was
no
servility,
hardly
homage;
but
there
were
interest
and
affection,
heightened
by
another
feeling.
Something
in
his
tone
when
he
spoke,
as
well
as
in
his
words,
marked
that
last
sentiment
to
be
gratitude.
"Your
debtor
bids
you
good
night!
May
you
rest
safely
and
serenely
till
morning."
"And
you,
Mr.
Moore
what
are
you
going
to
do?
What
have
you
been
saying
to
Mr.
Helstone,
with
whom
I
saw
you
shake
hands?
Why
did
