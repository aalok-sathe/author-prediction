turned
her
eyes
from
the
encounter
of
your
own
lest
their
clearness
should
reveal
too
much;
supposing,
in
short,
your
Mary
had
been
not
cold,
but
modest;
not
vacant,
but
reflective;
not
obtuse,
but
sensitive;
not
inane,
but
innocent;
not
prudish,
but
pure,
would
you
have
left
her
to
court
another
woman
for
her
wealth?"
Mr.
Yorke
raised
his
hat,
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief.
"The
moon
is
up,"
was
his
first
not
quite
relevant
remark,
pointing
with
his
whip
across
the
moor.
"There
she
is,
rising
into
the
haze,
staring
at
us
wi'
a
strange
red
glower.
She
is
no
more
silver
than
old
Helstone's
brow
is
ivory.
What
does
she
mean
by
leaning
her
cheek
on
Rushedge
i'
that
way,
and
looking
at
us
wi'
a
scowl
and
a
menace?"
"Yorke,
if
Mary
had
loved
you
silently
yet
faithfully,
chastely
yet
fervently,
as
you
would
wish
your
wife
to
love,
would
you
have
left
her?"
"Robert!"
he
lifted
his
arm,
he
held
it
suspended,
and
paused
"Robert!
this
is
a
queer
world,
and
men
are
made
of
the
queerest
dregs
that
Chaos
churned
up
in
her
ferment.
I
might
swear
sounding
oaths
oaths
that
would
make
the
poachers
think
there
was
a
bittern
booming
in
Bilberry
Moss
that,
in
the
case
you
put,
death
only
should
have
parted
me
from
Mary.
But
I
have
lived
in
the
world
fifty
five
years;
I
have
been
forced
to
study
human
nature;
and,
to
speak
a
dark
truth,
the
odds
are,
if
Mary
had
loved
and
not
scorned
me,
if
I
had
been
secure
of
her
affection,
certain
of
her
constancy,
been
irritated
by
no
doubts,
stung
by
no
humiliations
the
odds
are"
(he
let
his
hand
fall
heavy
on
the
saddle)
"the
odds
are
I
should
have
left
her!"
They
rode
side
by
side
in
silence.
Ere
either
spoke
again
they
were
on
the
other
side
of
Rushedge.
Briarfield
lights
starred
the
purple
skirt
of
the
moor.
Robert,
being
the
youngest,
and
having
less
of
the
past
to
absorb
him
than
his
comrade,
recommenced
first.
"I
believe
I
daily
find
it
proved
that
we
can
get
nothing
in
this
world
worth
keeping,
not
so
much
as
a
principle
or
a
conviction,
except
out
of
purifying
flame
or
through
strengthening
peril.
We
err,
we
fall,
we
are
humbled;
then
we
walk
more
carefully.
We
greedily
eat
and
drink
poison
out
of
the
gilded
cup
of
vice
or
from
the
beggar's
wallet
of
avarice.
We
are
sickened,
degraded;
everything
good
in
us
rebels
against
us;
our
souls
rise
bitterly
indignant
against
our
bodies;
there
is
a
period
of
civil
war;
if
the
soul
has
strength,
it
conquers
and
rules
thereafter."
"What
art
thou
going
to
do
now,
Robert?
What
are
thy
plans?"
"For
my
private
plans,
I'll
keep
them
to
myself
which
is
very
easy,
as
at
present
I
have
none.
No
private
life
is
permitted
a
man
in
my
position
a
man
in
debt.
For
my
public
plans,
my
views
are
a
little
altered.
While
I
was
in
Birmingham
I
looked
a
little
into
reality,
considered
closely
and
at
their
source
the
causes
of
the
present
troubles
of
this
country.
I
did
the
same
in
London.
Unknown,
I
could
go
where
I
pleased,
mix
with
whom
I
would.
I
went
where
there
was
want
of
food,
of
fuel,
of
clothing;
where
there
was
no
occupation
and
no
hope.
I
saw
some,
with
naturally
elevated
tendencies
and
good
feelings,
kept
down
amongst
sordid
privations
and
harassing
griefs.
I
saw
many
originally
low,
and
to
whom
lack
of
education
left
scarcely
anything
but
animal
wants,
disappointed
in
those
wants,
ahungered,
athirst,
and
desperate
as
famished
animals.
I
saw
what
taught
my
brain
a
new
lesson,
and
filled
my
breast
with
fresh
feelings.
I
have
no
intention
to
profess
more
softness
or
sentiment
than
I
have
hitherto
professed;
mutiny
and
ambition
I
regard
as
I
have
always
regarded
them.
I
should
resist
a
riotous
mob
just
as
heretofore;
I
should
open
on
the
scent
of
a
runaway
ringleader
as
eagerly
as
ever,
and
run
him
down
as
relentlessly,
and
follow
him
up
to
condign
punishment
as
rigorously;
but
I
should
do
it
now
chiefly
for
the
sake
and
the
security
of
those
he
misled.
Something
there
is
to
look
to,
Yorke,
beyond
a
man's
personal
interest,
beyond
the
advancement
of
well
laid
schemes,
beyond
even
the
discharge
of
dishonouring
debts.
To
respect
himself,
a
man
must
believe
he
renders
justice
to
his
fellow
men.
Unless
I
am
more
considerate
to
ignorance,
more
forbearing
to
suffering,
than
I
have
hitherto
been,
I
shall
scorn
myself
as
grossly
unjust.
What
now?"
he
said,
addressing
his
horse,
which,
hearing
the
ripple
of
water,
and
feeling
thirsty,
turned
to
a
wayside
trough,
where
the
moonbeam
was
playing
in
a
crystal
eddy.
"Yorke,"
pursued
Moore,
"ride
on;
I
must
let
him
drink."
Yorke
accordingly
rode
slowly
forwards,
occupying
himself
as
he
advanced
in
discriminating,
amongst
the
many
lights
now
spangling
the
distance,
those
of
Briarmains.
Stilbro'
Moor
was
left
behind;
plantations
rose
dusk
on
either
hand;
they
were
descending
the
hill;
below
them
lay
the
valley
with
its
populous
parish:
they
felt
already
at
home.
Surrounded
no
longer
by
heath,
it
was
not
startling
to
Mr.
Yorke
to
see
a
hat
rise,
and
to
hear
a
voice
speak
behind
the
wall.
The
words,
however,
were
peculiar.
"When
the
wicked
perisheth
there
is
shouting,"
it
said;
and
added,
"As
the
whirlwind
passeth,
so
is
the
wicked
no
more"
(with
a
deeper
growl):
"terrors
take
hold
of
him
as
waters;
hell
is
naked
before
him.
He
shall
die
without
knowledge."
A
fierce
flash
and
sharp
crack
violated
the
calm
of
night.
Yorke,
ere
he
turned,
knew
the
four
convicts
of
Birmingham
were
avenged.
The
die
was
cast.
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
knew
it;
Shirley
knew
it;
Mr.
Sympson
knew
it.
That
evening,
when
all
the
Fieldhead
family
dined
at
Nunnely
Priory,
decided
the
business.
Two
or
three
things
conduced
to
bring
