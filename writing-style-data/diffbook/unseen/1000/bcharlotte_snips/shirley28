back,
as
one
of
the
first
"duties
of
a
woman."
She
herself
had
had
a
needle,
cotton,
and
a
fearfully
torn
stocking
put
into
her
hand
while
she
yet
wore
a
child's
coif
on
her
little
black
head;
her
"hauts
faits"
in
the
darning
line
had
been
exhibited
to
company
ere
she
was
six
years
old;
and
when
she
first
discovered
that
Caroline
was
profoundly
ignorant
of
this
most
essential
of
attainments,
she
could
have
wept
with
pity
over
her
miserably
neglected
youth.
No
time
did
she
lose
in
seeking
up
a
hopeless
pair
of
hose,
of
which
the
heels
were
entirely
gone,
and
in
setting
the
ignorant
English
girl
to
repair
the
deficiency.
This
task
had
been
commenced
two
years
ago,
and
Caroline
had
the
stockings
in
her
work
bag
yet.
She
did
a
few
rows
every
day,
by
way
of
penance
for
the
expiation
of
her
sins.
They
were
a
grievous
burden
to
her;
she
would
much
have
liked
to
put
them
in
the
fire;
and
once
Mr.
Moore,
who
had
observed
her
sitting
and
sighing
over
them,
had
proposed
a
private
incremation
in
the
counting
house;
but
to
this
proposal
Caroline
knew
it
would
have
been
impolitic
to
accede
the
result
could
only
be
a
fresh
pair
of
hose,
probably
in
worse
condition.
She
adhered,
therefore,
to
the
ills
she
knew.
All
the
afternoon
the
two
ladies
sat
and
sewed,
till
the
eyes
and
fingers,
and
even
the
spirits
of
one
of
them,
were
weary.
The
sky
since
dinner
had
darkened;
it
had
begun
to
rain
again,
to
pour
fast.
Secret
fears
began
to
steal
on
Caroline
that
Robert
would
be
persuaded
by
Mr.
Sykes
or
Mr.
Yorke
to
remain
at
Whinbury
till
it
cleared,
and
of
that
there
appeared
no
present
chance.
Five
o'clock
struck,
and
time
stole
on;
still
the
clouds
streamed.
A
sighing
wind
whispered
in
the
roof
trees
of
the
cottage;
day
seemed
already
closing;
the
parlour
fire
shed
on
the
clear
hearth
a
glow
ruddy
as
at
twilight.
"It
will
not
be
fair
till
the
moon
rises,"
pronounced
Mademoiselle
Moore,
"consequently
I
feel
assured
that
my
brother
will
not
return
till
then.
Indeed
I
should
be
sorry
if
he
did.
We
will
have
coffee.
It
would
be
vain
to
wait
for
him."
"I
am
tired.
May
I
leave
my
work
now,
cousin?"
"You
may,
since
it
grows
too
dark
to
see
to
do
it
well.
Fold
it
up;
put
it
carefully
in
your
bag;
then
step
into
the
kitchen
and
desire
Sarah
to
bring
in
the
gouter,
or
tea,
as
you
call
it."
"But
it
has
not
yet
struck
six.
He
may
still
come."
"He
will
not,
I
tell
you.
I
can
calculate
his
movements.
I
understand
my
brother."
Suspense
is
irksome,
disappointment
bitter.
All
the
world
has,
some
time
or
other,
felt
that.
Caroline,
obedient
to
orders,
passed
into
the
kitchen.
Sarah
was
making
a
dress
for
herself
at
the
table.
"You
are
to
bring
in
coffee,"
said
the
young
lady
in
a
spiritless
tone;
and
then
she
leaned
her
arm
and
head
against
the
kitchen
mantelpiece,
and
hung
listlessly
over
the
fire.
"How
low
you
seem,
miss!
But
it's
all
because
your
cousin
keeps
you
so
close
to
work.
It's
a
shame!"
"Nothing
of
the
kind,
Sarah,"
was
the
brief
reply.
"Oh!
but
I
know
it
is.
You're
fit
to
cry
just
this
minute,
for
nothing
else
but
because
you've
sat
still
the
whole
day.
It
would
make
a
kitten
dull
to
be
mewed
up
so."
"Sarah,
does
your
master
often
come
home
early
from
market
when
it
is
wet?"
"Never,
hardly;
but
just
to
day,
for
some
reason,
he
has
made
a
difference."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"He
is
come.
I
am
certain
I
saw
Murgatroyd
lead
his
horse
into
the
yard
by
the
back
way,
when
I
went
to
get
some
water
at
the
pump
five
minutes
since.
He
was
in
the
counting
house
with
Joe
Scott,
I
believe."
"You
are
mistaken."
"What
should
I
be
mistaken
for?
I
know
his
horse
surely?"
"But
you
did
not
see
himself?"
"I
heard
him
speak,
though.
He
was
saying
something
to
Joe
Scott
about
having
settled
all
concerning
ways
and
means,
and
that
there
would
be
a
new
set
of
frames
in
the
mill
before
another
week
passed,
and
that
this
time
he
would
get
four
soldiers
from
Stilbro'
barracks
to
guard
the
wagon."
"Sarah,
are
you
making
a
gown?"
"Yes.
Is
it
a
handsome
one?"
"Beautiful!
Get
the
coffee
ready.
I'll
finish
cutting
out
that
sleeve
for
you,
and
I'll
give
you
some
trimming
for
it.
I
have
some
narrow
satin
ribbon
of
a
colour
that
will
just
match
it."
"You're
very
kind,
miss."
"Be
quick;
there's
a
good
girl.
But
first
put
your
master's
shoes
on
the
hearth:
he
will
take
his
boots
off
when
he
comes
in.
I
hear
him;
he
is
coming."
"Miss,
you
are
cutting
the
stuff
wrong."
"So
I
am;
but
it
is
only
a
snip.
There
is
no
harm
done."
The
kitchen
door
opened;
Mr.
Moore
entered,
very
wet
and
cold.
Caroline
half
turned
from
her
dressmaking
occupation,
but
renewed
it
for
a
moment,
as
if
to
gain
a
minute's
time
for
some
purpose.
Bent
over
the
dress,
her
face
was
hidden;
there
was
an
attempt
to
settle
her
features
and
veil
their
expression,
which
failed.
When
she
at
last
met
Mr.
Moore,
her
countenance
beamed.
"We
had
ceased
to
expect
you.
They
asserted
you
would
not
come,"
she
said.
"But
I
promised
to
return
soon.
You
expected
me,
I
suppose?"
"No,
Robert;
I
dared
not
when
it
rained
so
fast.
And
you
are
wet
and
chilled.
Change
everything.
If
you
took
cold,
I
should
we
should
blame
ourselves
in
some
measure."
"I
am
not
wet
through:
my
riding
coat
is
waterproof.
Dry
shoes
are
all
I
require.
There
the
fire
is
pleasant
after
facing
the
cold
wind
and
rain
for
a
few
miles."
He
stood
on
the
kitchen
hearth;
Caroline
stood
beside
