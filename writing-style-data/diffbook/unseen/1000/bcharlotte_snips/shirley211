will
be
a
scene.
I
neither
invite
it
nor
fear
it;
only,
you
must
be
present,
for
I
am
inexpressibly
tired
of
facing
him
solus.
I
don't
like
to
see
him
in
a
rage.
He
then
puts
off
all
his
fine
proprieties
and
conventional
disguises,
and
the
real
human
being
below
is
what
you
would
call
commun,
plat,
bas
vilain
et
un
peu
mechant.
His
ideas
are
not
clean,
Mr.
Moore;
they
want
scouring
with
soft
soap
and
fuller's
earth.
I
think,
if
he
could
add
his
imagination
to
the
contents
of
Mrs.
Gill's
bucking
basket,
and
let
her
boil
it
in
her
copper,
with
rain
water
and
bleaching
powder
(I
hope
you
think
me
a
tolerable
laundress),
it
would
do
him
incalculable
good.'
"This
morning,
fancying
I
heard
her
descend
somewhat
early,
I
was
down
instantly.
I
had
not
been
deceived.
There
she
was,
busy
at
work
in
the
breakfast
parlour,
of
which
the
housemaid
was
completing
the
arrangement
and
dusting.
She
had
risen
betimes
to
finish
some
little
keepsake
she
intended
for
Henry.
I
got
only
a
cool
reception,
which
I
accepted
till
the
girl
was
gone,
taking
my
book
to
the
window
seat
very
quietly.
Even
when
we
were
alone
I
was
slow
to
disturb
her.
To
sit
with
her
in
sight
was
happiness,
and
the
proper
happiness,
for
early
morning
serene,
incomplete,
but
progressive.
Had
I
been
obtrusive,
I
knew
I
should
have
encountered
rebuff.
'Not
at
home
to
suitors'
was
written
on
her
brow.
Therefore
I
read
on,
stole
now
and
then
a
look,
watched
her
countenance
soften
and
open
as
she
felt
I
respected
her
mood,
and
enjoyed
the
gentle
content
of
the
moment.
"The
distance
between
us
shrank,
and
the
light
hoar
frost
thawed
insensibly.
Ere
an
hour
elapsed
I
was
at
her
side,
watching
her
sew,
gathering
her
sweet
smiles
and
her
merry
words,
which
fell
for
me
abundantly.
We
sat,
as
we
had
a
right
to
sit,
side
by
side;
my
arm
rested
on
her
chair;
I
was
near
enough
to
count
the
stitches
of
her
work,
and
to
discern
the
eye
of
her
needle.
The
door
suddenly
opened.
"I
believe,
if
I
had
just
then
started
from
her,
she
would
have
despised
me.
Thanks
to
the
phlegm
of
my
nature,
I
rarely
start.
When
I
am
well
off,
bien,
comfortable,
I
am
not
soon
stirred.
Bien
I
was
tres
bien
consequently
immutable.
No
muscle
moved.
I
hardly
looked
to
the
door.
"'Good
morning,
uncle,'
said
she,
addressing
that
personage,
who
paused
on
the
threshold
in
a
state
of
petrifaction.
"'Have
you
been
long
downstairs,
Miss
Keeldar,
and
alone
with
Mr.
Moore?'
"'Yes,
a
very
long
time.
We
both
came
down
early;
it
was
scarcely
light.'
"'The
proceeding
is
improper
'
"'It
was
at
first,
I
was
rather
cross,
and
not
civil;
but
you
will
perceive
that
we
are
now
friends.'
"'I
perceive
more
than
you
would
wish
me
to
perceive.'
"'Hardly,
sir,'
said
I;
'we
have
no
disguises.
Will
you
permit
me
to
intimate
that
any
further
observations
you
have
to
make
may
as
well
be
addressed
to
me?
Henceforward
I
stand
between
Miss
Keeldar
and
all
annoyance.'
"'You!
What
have
you
to
do
with
Miss
Keeldar?'
"'To
protect,
watch
over,
serve
her.'
"'You,
sir
you,
the
tutor?'
"'Not
one
word
of
insult,
sir,'
interposed
she;
'not
one
syllable
of
disrespect
to
Mr.
Moore
in
this
house.'
"'Do
you
take
his
part?'
"'His
part?
oh
yes!'
"She
turned
to
me
with
a
sudden
fond
movement,
which
I
met
by
circling
her
with
my
arm.
She
and
I
both
rose.
"'Good
Ged!'
was
the
cry
from
the
morning
gown
standing
quivering
at
the
door.
Ged,
I
think,
must
be
the
cognomen
of
Mr.
Sympson's
Lares.
When
hard
pressed
he
always
invokes
this
idol.
"'Come
forward,
uncle;
you
shall
hear
all.
Tell
him
all,
Louis.'
"'I
dare
him
to
speak
the
beggar!
the
knave!
the
specious
hypocrite!
the
vile,
insinuating,
infamous
menial!
Stand
apart
from
my
niece,
sir.
Let
her
go!'
"She
clung
to
me
with
energy.
'I
am
near
my
future
husband,'
she
said.
'Who
dares
touch
him
or
me?'
"'Her
husband!'
He
raised
and
spread
his
hands.
He
dropped
into
a
seat.
"'A
while
ago
you
wanted
much
to
know
whom
I
meant
to
marry.
My
intention
was
then
formed,
but
not
mature
for
communication.
Now
it
is
ripe,
sun
mellowed,
perfect.
Take
the
crimson
peach
take
Louis
Moore!'
"'But'
(savagely)
'you
shall
not
have
him;
he
shall
not
have
you.'
"'I
would
die
before
I
would
have
another.
I
would
die
if
I
might
not
have
him.'
"He
uttered
words
with
which
this
page
shall
never
be
polluted.
"She
turned
white
as
death;
she
shook
all
over;
she
lost
her
strength.
I
laid
her
down
on
the
sofa;
just
looked
to
ascertain
that
she
had
not
fainted
of
which,
with
a
divine
smile,
she
assured
me.
I
kissed
her;
and
then,
if
I
were
to
perish,
I
cannot
give
a
clear
account
of
what
happened
in
the
course
of
the
next
five
minutes.
She
has
since
through
tears,
laughter,
and
trembling
told
me
that
I
turned
terrible,
and
gave
myself
to
the
demon.
She
says
I
left
her,
made
one
bound
across
the
room;
that
Mr.
Sympson
vanished
through
the
door
as
if
shot
from
a
cannon.
I
also
vanished,
and
she
heard
Mrs.
Gill
scream.
"Mrs.
Gill
was
still
screaming
when
I
came
to
my
senses.
I
was
then
in
another
apartment
the
oak
parlour,
I
think.
I
held
Sympson
before
me
crushed
into
a
chair,
and
my
hand
was
on
his
cravat.
His
eyes
rolled
in
his
head;
I
was
strangling
him,
I
think.
The
housekeeper
stood
wringing
her
hands,
entreating
me
to
desist.
I
desisted
that
moment,
and
felt
at
once
as
cool
as
stone.
But
I
told
Mrs.
Gill
to
fetch
the
Red
House
Inn
chaise
instantly,
and
informed
Mr.
Sympson
he
must
depart
from
Fieldhead
the
instant
it
came.
Though
half
frightened
out
of
