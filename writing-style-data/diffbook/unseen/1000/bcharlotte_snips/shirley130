for
ever.
It
may
perish
with
the
dawn
of
eternity,
but
it
tortures
through
time
into
its
deepest
night."
"Yes,
it
tortures
through
time,"
agreed
Caroline,
"except
when
it
is
mutual
love."
"Mutual
love!
My
dear,
romances
are
pernicious.
You
do
not
read
them,
I
hope?"
"Sometimes
whenever
I
can
get
them,
indeed.
But
romance
writers
might
know
nothing
of
love,
judging
by
the
way
in
which
they
treat
of
it."
"Nothing
whatever,
my
dear,"
assented
Mrs.
Pryor
eagerly,
"nor
of
marriage;
and
the
false
pictures
they
give
of
those
subjects
cannot
be
too
strongly
condemned.
They
are
not
like
reality.
They
show
you
only
the
green,
tempting
surface
of
the
marsh,
and
give
not
one
faithful
or
truthful
hint
of
the
slough
underneath."
"But
it
is
not
always
slough,"
objected
Caroline.
"There
are
happy
marriages.
Where
affection
is
reciprocal
and
sincere,
and
minds
are
harmonious,
marriage
must
be
happy."
"It
is
never
wholly
happy.
Two
people
can
never
literally
be
as
one.
There
is,
perhaps,
a
possibility
of
content
under
peculiar
circumstances,
such
as
are
seldom
combined;
but
it
is
as
well
not
to
run
the
risk
you
may
make
fatal
mistakes.
Be
satisfied,
my
dear.
Let
all
the
single
be
satisfied
with
their
freedom."
"You
echo
my
uncle's
words!"
exclaimed
Caroline,
in
a
tone
of
dismay.
"You
speak
like
Mrs.
Yorke
in
her
most
gloomy
moments,
like
Miss
Mann
when
she
is
most
sourly
and
hypochondriacally
disposed.
This
is
terrible!"
"No,
it
is
only
true.
O
child,
you
have
only
lived
the
pleasant
morning
time
of
life;
the
hot,
weary
noon,
the
sad
evening,
the
sunless
night,
are
yet
to
come
for
you.
Mr.
Helstone,
you
say,
talks
as
I
talk;
and
I
wonder
how
Mrs.
Matthewson
Helstone
would
have
talked
had
she
been
living.
She
died!
she
died!"
"And,
alas!
my
own
mother
and
father
"
exclaimed
Caroline,
struck
by
a
sombre
recollection.
"What
of
them?"
"Did
I
never
tell
you
that
they
were
separated?"
"I
have
heard
it."
"They
must,
then,
have
been
very
miserable."
"You
see
all
facts
go
to
prove
what
I
say."
"In
this
case
there
ought
to
be
no
such
thing
as
marriage."
"There
ought,
my
dear,
were
it
only
to
prove
that
this
life
is
a
mere
state
of
probation,
wherein
neither
rest
nor
recompense
is
to
be
vouchsafed."
"But
your
own
marriage,
Mrs.
Pryor?"
Mrs.
Pryor
shrank
and
shuddered
as
if
a
rude
finger
had
pressed
a
naked
nerve.
Caroline
felt
she
had
touched
what
would
not
bear
the
slightest
contact.
"My
marriage
was
unhappy,"
said
the
lady,
summoning
courage
at
last;
"but
yet
"
She
hesitated.
"But
yet,"
suggested
Caroline,
"not
immitigably
wretched?"
"Not
in
its
results,
at
least.
No,"
she
added,
in
a
softer
tone;
"God
mingles
something
of
the
balm
of
mercy
even
in
vials
of
the
most
corrosive
woe.
He
can
so
turn
events
that
from
the
very
same
blind,
rash
act
whence
sprang
the
curse
of
half
our
life
may
flow
the
blessing
of
the
remainder.
Then
I
am
of
a
peculiar
disposition
I
own
that
far
from
facile,
without
address,
in
some
points
eccentric.
I
ought
never
to
have
married.
Mine
is
not
the
nature
easily
to
find
a
duplicate
or
likely
to
assimilate
with
a
contrast.
I
was
quite
aware
of
my
own
ineligibility;
and
if
I
had
not
been
so
miserable
as
a
governess,
I
never
should
have
married;
and
then
"
Caroline's
eyes
asked
her
to
proceed.
They
entreated
her
to
break
the
thick
cloud
of
despair
which
her
previous
words
had
seemed
to
spread
over
life.
"And
then,
my
dear,
Mr.
that
is,
the
gentleman
I
married
was,
perhaps,
rather
an
exceptional
than
an
average
character.
I
hope,
at
least,
the
experience
of
few
has
been
such
as
mine
was,
or
that
few
have
felt
their
sufferings
as
I
felt
mine.
They
nearly
shook
my
mind;
relief
was
so
hopeless,
redress
so
unattainable.
But,
my
dear,
I
do
not
wish
to
dishearten;
I
only
wish
to
warn
you,
and
to
prove
that
the
single
should
not
be
too
anxious
to
change
their
state,
as
they
may
change
for
the
worse."
"Thank
you,
my
dear
madam.
I
quite
understand
your
kind
intentions,
but
there
is
no
fear
of
my
falling
into
the
error
to
which
you
allude.
I,
at
least,
have
no
thoughts
of
marriage,
and
for
that
reason
I
want
to
make
myself
a
position
by
some
other
means."
"My
dear,
listen
to
me.
On
what
I
am
going
to
say
I
have
carefully
deliberated,
having,
indeed,
revolved
the
subject
in
my
thoughts
ever
since
you
first
mentioned
your
wish
to
obtain
a
situation.
You
know
I
at
present
reside
with
Miss
Keeldar
in
the
capacity
of
companion.
Should
she
marry
(and
that
she
will
marry
ere
long
many
circumstances
induce
me
to
conclude),
I
shall
cease
to
be
necessary
to
her
in
that
capacity.
I
must
tell
you
that
I
possess
a
small
independency,
arising
partly
from
my
own
savings,
and
partly
from
a
legacy
left
me
some
years
since.
Whenever
I
leave
Fieldhead
I
shall
take
a
house
of
my
own.
I
could
not
endure
to
live
in
solitude.
I
have
no
relations
whom
I
care
to
invite
to
close
intimacy;
for,
as
you
must
have
observed,
and
as
I
have
already
avowed,
my
habits
and
tastes
have
their
peculiarities.
To
you,
my
dear,
I
need
not
say
I
am
attached;
with
you
I
am
happier
than
I
have
ever
been
with
any
living
thing"
(this
was
said
with
marked
emphasis).
"Your
society
I
should
esteem
a
very
dear
privilege
an
inestimable
privilege,
a
comfort,
a
blessing.
You
shall
come
to
me,
then.
Caroline,
do
you
refuse
me?
I
hope
you
can
love
me?"
And
with
these
two
abrupt
questions
she
stopped.
"Indeed,
I
do
love
you,"
was
the
reply.
"I
should
like
to
live
with
you.
But
you
are
too
kind."
"All
I
have,"
went
on
Mrs.
Pryor,
"I
would
leave
to
you.
You
should
be
provided
