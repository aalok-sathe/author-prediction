by
glad
hills,
all
verdure
and
light,
she
reaches
a
station
scarcely
lower
than
that
whence
angels
looked
down
on
the
dreamer
of
Bethel,
and
her
eye
seeks,
and
her
soul
possesses,
the
vision
of
life
as
she
wishes
it.
No,
not
as
she
wishes
it;
she
has
not
time
to
wish.
The
swift
glory
spreads
out,
sweeping
and
kindling,
and
multiplies
its
splendours
faster
than
Thought
can
effect
his
combinations,
faster
than
Aspiration
can
utter
her
longings.
Shirley
says
nothing
while
the
trance
is
upon
her
she
is
quite
mute;
but
if
Mrs.
Pryor
speaks
to
her
now,
she
goes
out
quietly,
and
continues
her
walk
upstairs
in
the
dim
gallery.
If
Shirley
were
not
an
indolent,
a
reckless,
an
ignorant
being,
she
would
take
a
pen
at
such
moments,
or
at
least
while
the
recollection
of
such
moments
was
yet
fresh
on
her
spirit.
She
would
seize,
she
would
fix
the
apparition,
tell
the
vision
revealed.
Had
she
a
little
more
of
the
organ
of
acquisitiveness
in
her
head,
a
little
more
of
the
love
of
property
in
her
nature,
she
would
take
a
good
sized
sheet
of
paper
and
write
plainly
out,
in
her
own
queer
but
clear
and
legible
hand,
the
story
that
has
been
narrated,
the
song
that
has
been
sung
to
her,
and
thus
possess
what
she
was
enabled
to
create.
But
indolent
she
is,
reckless
she
is,
and
most
ignorant;
for
she
does
not
know
her
dreams
are
rare,
her
feelings
peculiar.
She
does
not
know,
has
never
known,
and
will
die
without
knowing,
the
full
value
of
that
spring
whose
bright
fresh
bubbling
in
her
heart
keeps
it
green.
Shirley
takes
life
easily.
Is
not
that
fact
written
in
her
eye?
In
her
good
tempered
moments
is
it
not
as
full
of
lazy
softness
as
in
her
brief
fits
of
anger
it
is
fulgent
with
quick
flashing
fire?
Her
nature
is
in
her
eye.
So
long
as
she
is
calm,
indolence,
indulgence,
humour,
and
tenderness
possess
that
large
gray
sphere;
incense
her,
a
red
ray
pierces
the
dew,
it
quickens
instantly
to
flame.
Ere
the
month
of
July
was
past,
Miss
Keeldar
would
probably
have
started
with
Caroline
on
that
northern
tour
they
had
planned;
but
just
at
that
epoch
an
invasion
befell
Fieldhead.
A
genteel
foraging
party
besieged
Shirley
in
her
castle,
and
compelled
her
to
surrender
at
discretion.
An
uncle,
an
aunt,
and
two
cousins
from
the
south
a
Mr.,
Mrs.,
and
two
Misses
Sympson,
of
Sympson
Grove,
shire
came
down
upon
her
in
state.
The
laws
of
hospitality
obliged
her
to
give
in,
which
she
did
with
a
facility
which
somewhat
surprised
Caroline,
who
knew
her
to
be
prompt
in
action
and
fertile
in
expedient
where
a
victory
was
to
be
gained
for
her
will.
Miss
Helstone
even
asked
her
how
it
was
she
submitted
so
readily.
She
answered,
old
feelings
had
their
power;
she
had
passed
two
years
of
her
early
youth
at
Sympson
Grove.
"How
did
she
like
her
relatives?"
She
had
nothing
in
common
with
them,
she
replied.
Little
Harry
Sympson,
indeed,
the
sole
son
of
the
family,
was
very
unlike
his
sisters,
and
of
him
she
had
formerly
been
fond;
but
he
was
not
coming
to
Yorkshire
at
least
not
yet.
The
next
Sunday
the
Fieldhead
pew
in
Briarfield
Church
appeared
peopled
with
a
prim,
trim,
fidgety,
elderly
gentleman,
who
shifted
his
spectacles,
and
changed
his
position
every
three
minutes;
a
patient,
placid
looking
elderly
lady
in
brown
satin;
and
two
pattern
young
ladies,
in
pattern
attire,
with
pattern
deportment.
Shirley
had
the
air
of
a
black
swan
or
a
white
crow
in
the
midst
of
this
party,
and
very
forlorn
was
her
aspect.
Having
brought
her
into
respectable
society,
we
will
leave
her
there
a
while,
and
look
after
Miss
Helstone.
Separated
from
Miss
Keeldar
for
the
present,
as
she
could
not
seek
her
in
the
midst
of
her
fine
relatives,
scared
away
from
Fieldhead
by
the
visiting
commotion
which
the
new
arrivals
occasioned
in
the
neighbourhood,
Caroline
was
limited
once
more
to
the
gray
rectory,
the
solitary
morning
walk
in
remote
by
paths,
the
long,
lonely
afternoon
sitting
in
a
quiet
parlour
which
the
sun
forsook
at
noon,
or
in
the
garden
alcove
where
it
shone
bright,
yet
sad,
on
the
ripening
red
currants
trained
over
the
trellis,
and
on
the
fair
monthly
roses
entwined
between,
and
through
them
fell
chequered
on
Caroline
sitting
in
her
white
summer
dress,
still
as
a
garden
statue.
There
she
read
old
books,
taken
from
her
uncle's
library.
The
Greek
and
Latin
were
of
no
use
to
her,
and
its
collection
of
light
literature
was
chiefly
contained
on
a
shelf
which
had
belonged
to
her
aunt
Mary
some
venerable
Lady's
Magazines,
that
had
once
performed
a
sea
voyage
with
their
owner,
and
undergone
a
storm,
and
whose
pages
were
stained
with
salt
water;
some
mad
Methodist
Magazines,
full
of
miracles
and
apparitions,
of
preternatural
warnings,
ominous
dreams,
and
frenzied
fanaticism;
the
equally
mad
letters
of
Mrs.
Elizabeth
Rowe
from
the
Dead
to
the
Living;
a
few
old
English
classics.
From
these
faded
flowers
Caroline
had
in
her
childhood
extracted
the
honey;
they
were
tasteless
to
her
now.
By
way
of
change,
and
also
of
doing
good,
she
would
sew
make
garments
for
the
poor,
according
to
good
Miss
Ainley's
direction.
Sometimes,
as
she
felt
and
saw
her
tears
fall
slowly
on
her
work,
she
would
wonder
how
the
excellent
woman
who
had
cut
it
out
and
arranged
it
for
her
managed
to
be
so
equably
serene
in
her
solitude.
"I
never
find
Miss
Ainley
oppressed
with
despondency
or
lost
in
grief,"
she
thought;
"yet
her
cottage
is
a
still,
dim
little
place,
and
she
is
without
a
bright
hope
or
near
friend
in
the
world.
I
remember,
though,
she
told
me
once
she
had
tutored
her
thoughts
to
tend
upwards
to
heaven.
She
allowed
there
was,
and
ever
had
been,
little
enjoyment
in
this
world
for
her,
