a
smile,
half
corrective,
half
grateful.
The
slightest
possible
shake
of
the
head
delicately
marked
the
former
quality;
it
is
probable
a
gentle
pressure
indicated
the
latter.
"You
may
sit
where
you
can
now,
Mr.
Moore,"
said
Shirley,
also
smiling.
"You
see
there
is
not
an
inch
of
room
for
you
here;
but
I
discern
plenty
of
space
at
Mrs.
Boultby's
table,
between
Miss
Armitage
and
Miss
Birtwhistle.
Go!
John
Sykes
will
be
your
vis
a
vis,
and
you
will
sit
with
your
back
towards
us."
Moore,
however,
preferred
lingering
about
where
he
was.
He
now
and
then
took
a
turn
down
the
long
room,
pausing
in
his
walk
to
interchange
greetings
with
other
gentlemen
in
his
own
placeless
predicament;
but
still
he
came
back
to
the
magnet,
Shirley,
bringing
with
him,
each
time
he
returned,
observations
it
was
necessary
to
whisper
in
her
ear.
Meantime
poor
Sam
Wynne
looked
far
from
comfortable.
His
fair
neighbour,
judging
from
her
movements,
appeared
in
a
mood
the
most
unquiet
and
unaccommodating.
She
would
not
sit
still
two
seconds.
She
was
hot;
she
fanned
herself;
complained
of
want
of
air
and
space.
She
remarked
that,
in
her
opinion,
when
people
had
finished
their
tea
they
ought
to
leave
the
tables,
and
announced
distinctly
that
she
expected
to
faint
if
the
present
state
of
things
continued.
Mr.
Sam
offered
to
accompany
her
into
the
open
air;
just
the
way
to
give
her
her
death
of
cold,
she
alleged.
In
short,
his
post
became
untenable;
and
having
swallowed
his
quantum
of
tea,
he
judged
it
expedient
to
evacuate.
Moore
should
have
been
at
hand,
whereas
he
was
quite
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
room,
deep
in
conference
with
Christopher
Sykes.
A
large
corn
factor,
Timothy
Ramsden,
Esq.,
happened
to
be
nearer;
and
feeling
himself
tired
of
standing,
he
advanced
to
fill
the
vacant
seat.
Shirley's
expedients
did
not
fail
her.
A
sweep
of
her
scarf
upset
her
teacup:
its
contents
were
shared
between
the
bench
and
her
own
satin
dress.
Of
course,
it
became
necessary
to
call
a
waiter
to
remedy
the
mischief.
Mr.
Ramsden,
a
stout,
puffy
gentleman,
as
large
in
person
as
he
was
in
property,
held
aloof
from
the
consequent
commotion.
Shirley,
usually
almost
culpably
indifferent
to
slight
accidents
affecting
dress,
etc.,
now
made
a
commotion
that
might
have
become
the
most
delicate
and
nervous
of
her
sex.
Mr.
Ramsden
opened
his
mouth,
withdrew
slowly,
and,
as
Miss
Keeldar
again
intimated
her
intention
to
"give
way"
and
swoon
on
the
spot,
he
turned
on
his
heel,
and
beat
a
heavy
retreat.
Moore
at
last
returned.
Calmly
surveying
the
bustle,
and
somewhat
quizzically
scanning
Shirley's
enigmatical
looking
countenance,
he
remarked
that
in
truth
this
was
the
hottest
end
of
the
room,
that
he
found
a
climate
there
calculated
to
agree
with
none
but
cool
temperaments
like
his
own;
and
putting
the
waiters,
the
napkins,
the
satin
robe
the
whole
turmoil,
in
short
to
one
side,
he
installed
himself
where
destiny
evidently
decreed
he
should
sit.
Shirley
subsided;
her
features
altered
their
lines;
the
raised
knit
brow
and
inexplicable
curve
of
the
mouth
became
straight
again;
wilfulness
and
roguery
gave
place
to
other
expressions;
and
all
the
angular
movements
with
which
she
had
vexed
the
soul
of
Sam
Wynne
were
conjured
to
rest
as
by
a
charm.
Still
no
gracious
glance
was
cast
on
Moore.
On
the
contrary,
he
was
accused
of
giving
her
a
world
of
trouble,
and
roundly
charged
with
being
the
cause
of
depriving
her
of
the
esteem
of
Mr.
Ramsden
and
the
invaluable
friendship
of
Mr.
Samuel
Wynne.
"Wouldn't
have
offended
either
gentleman
for
the
world,"
she
averred.
"I
have
always
been
accustomed
to
treat
both
with
the
most
respectful
consideration,
and
there,
owing
to
you,
how
they
have
been
used!
I
shall
not
be
happy
till
I
have
made
it
up.
I
never
am
happy
till
I
am
friends
with
my
neighbours.
So
to
morrow
I
must
make
a
pilgrimage
to
Royd
corn
mill,
soothe
the
miller,
and
praise
the
grain;
and
next
day
I
must
call
at
De
Walden
where
I
hate
to
go
and
carry
in
my
reticule
half
an
oatcake
to
give
to
Mr.
Sam's
favourite
pointers."
"You
know
the
surest
path
to
the
heart
of
each
swain,
I
doubt
not,"
said
Moore
quietly.
He
looked
very
content
to
have
at
last
secured
his
present
place;
but
he
made
no
fine
speech
expressive
of
gratification,
and
offered
no
apology
for
the
trouble
he
had
given.
His
phlegm
became
him
wonderfully.
It
made
him
look
handsomer,
he
was
so
composed;
it
made
his
vicinage
pleasant,
it
was
so
peace
restoring.
You
would
not
have
thought,
to
look
at
him,
that
he
was
a
poor,
struggling
man
seated
beside
a
rich
woman;
the
calm
of
equality
stilled
his
aspect;
perhaps
that
calm,
too,
reigned
in
his
soul.
Now
and
then,
from
the
way
in
which
he
looked
down
on
Miss
Keeldar
as
he
addressed
her,
you
would
have
fancied
his
station
towered
above
hers
as
much
as
his
stature
did.
Almost
stern
lights
sometimes
crossed
his
brow
and
gleamed
in
his
eyes.
Their
conversation
had
become
animated,
though
it
was
confined
to
a
low
key;
she
was
urging
him
with
questions
evidently
he
refused
to
her
curiosity
all
the
gratification
it
demanded.
She
sought
his
eye
once
with
hers.
You
read,
in
its
soft
yet
eager
expression,
that
it
solicited
clearer
replies.
Moore
smiled
pleasantly,
but
his
lips
continued
sealed.
Then
she
was
piqued,
and
turned
away;
but
he
recalled
her
attention
in
two
minutes.
He
seemed
making
promises,
which
he
soothed
her
into
accepting
in
lieu
of
information.
It
appeared
that
the
heat
of
the
room
did
not
suit
Miss
Helstone.
She
grew
paler
and
paler
as
the
process
of
tea
making
was
protracted.
The
moment
thanks
were
returned
she
quitted
the
table,
and
hastened
to
follow
her
cousin
Hortense,
who,
with
Miss
Mann,
had
already
sought
the
open
air.
Robert
Moore
had
risen
when
she
