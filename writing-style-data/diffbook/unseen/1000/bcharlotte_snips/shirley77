We
perished
each
alone!
But
I
beneath
a
rougher
sea,
And
whelmed
in
deeper
gulfs
than
he."
"I
hope
William
Cowper
is
safe
and
calm
in
heaven
now,"
said
Caroline.
"Do
you
pity
what
he
suffered
on
earth?"
asked
Miss
Keeldar.
"Pity
him,
Shirley?
What
can
I
do
else?
He
was
nearly
broken
hearted
when
he
wrote
that
poem,
and
it
almost
breaks
one's
heart
to
read
it.
But
he
found
relief
in
writing
it
I
know
he
did;
and
that
gift
of
poetry
the
most
divine
bestowed
on
man
was,
I
believe,
granted
to
allay
emotions
when
their
strength
threatens
harm.
It
seems
to
me,
Shirley,
that
nobody
should
write
poetry
to
exhibit
intellect
or
attainment.
Who
cares
for
that
sort
of
poetry?
Who
cares
for
learning
who
cares
for
fine
words
in
poetry?
And
who
does
not
care
for
feeling
real
feeling
however
simply,
even
rudely
expressed?"
"It
seems
you
care
for
it,
at
all
events;
and
certainly,
in
hearing
that
poem,
one
discovers
that
Cowper
was
under
an
impulse
strong
as
that
of
the
wind
which
drove
the
ship
an
impulse
which,
while
it
would
not
suffer
him
to
stop
to
add
ornament
to
a
single
stanza,
filled
him
with
force
to
achieve
the
whole
with
consummate
perfection.
You
managed
to
recite
it
with
a
steady
voice,
Caroline.
I
wonder
thereat."
"Cowper's
hand
did
not
tremble
in
writing
the
lines.
Why
should
my
voice
falter
in
repeating
them?
Depend
on
it,
Shirley,
no
tear
blistered
the
manuscript
of
'The
Castaway.'
I
hear
in
it
no
sob
of
sorrow,
only
the
cry
of
despair;
but,
that
cry
uttered,
I
believe
the
deadly
spasm
passed
from
his
heart,
that
he
wept
abundantly,
and
was
comforted."
Shirley
resumed
her
ballad
minstrelsy.
Stopping
short,
she
remarked
ere
long,
"One
could
have
loved
Cowper,
if
it
were
only
for
the
sake
of
having
the
privilege
of
comforting
him."
"You
never
would
have
loved
Cowper,"
rejoined
Caroline
promptly.
"He
was
not
made
to
be
loved
by
woman."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"What
I
say.
I
know
there
is
a
kind
of
natures
in
the
world
and
very
noble,
elevated
natures
too
whom
love
never
comes
near.
You
might
have
sought
Cowper
with
the
intention
of
loving
him,
and
you
would
have
looked
at
him,
pitied
him,
and
left
him,
forced
away
by
a
sense
of
the
impossible,
the
incongruous,
as
the
crew
were
borne
from
their
drowning
comrade
by
'the
furious
blast.'"
"You
may
be
right.
Who
told
you
this?"
"And
what
I
say
of
Cowper,
I
should
say
of
Rousseau.
Was
Rousseau
ever
loved?
He
loved
passionately;
but
was
his
passion
ever
returned?
I
am
certain,
never.
And
if
there
were
any
female
Cowpers
and
Rousseaus,
I
should
assert
the
same
of
them."
"Who
told
you
this,
I
ask?
Did
Moore?"
"Why
should
anybody
have
told
me?
Have
I
not
an
instinct?
Can
I
not
divine
by
analogy?
Moore
never
talked
to
me
either
about
Cowper,
or
Rousseau,
or
love.
The
voice
we
hear
in
solitude
told
me
all
I
know
on
these
subjects."
"Do
you
like
characters
of
the
Rousseau
order,
Caroline?"
"Not
at
all,
as
a
whole.
I
sympathize
intensely
with
certain
qualities
they
possess.
Certain
divine
sparks
in
their
nature
dazzle
my
eyes,
and
make
my
soul
glow.
Then,
again,
I
scorn
them.
They
are
made
of
clay
and
gold.
The
refuse
and
the
ore
make
a
mass
of
weakness:
taken
altogether,
I
feel
them
unnatural,
unhealthy,
repulsive."
"I
dare
say
I
should
be
more
tolerant
of
a
Rousseau
than
you
would,
Cary.
Submissive
and
contemplative
yourself,
you
like
the
stern
and
the
practical.
By
the
way,
you
must
miss
that
Cousin
Robert
of
yours
very
much,
now
that
you
and
he
never
meet."
"I
do."
"And
he
must
miss
you?"
"That
he
does
not."
"I
cannot
imagine,"
pursued
Shirley,
who
had
lately
got
a
habit
of
introducing
Moore's
name
into
the
conversation,
even
when
it
seemed
to
have
no
business
there
"I
cannot
imagine
but
that
he
was
fond
of
you,
since
he
took
so
much
notice
of
you,
talked
to
you,
and
taught
you
so
much."
"He
never
was
fond
of
me;
he
never
professed
to
be
fond
of
me.
He
took
pains
to
prove
that
he
only
just
tolerated
me."
Caroline,
determined
not
to
err
on
the
flattering
side
in
estimating
her
cousin's
regard
for
her,
always
now
habitually
thought
of
it
and
mentioned
it
in
the
most
scanty
measure.
She
had
her
own
reasons
for
being
less
sanguine
than
ever
in
hopeful
views
of
the
future,
less
indulgent
to
pleasurable
retrospections
of
the
past.
"Of
course,
then,"
observed
Miss
Keeldar,
"you
only
just
tolerated
him
in
return?"
"Shirley,
men
and
women
are
so
different;
they
are
in
such
a
different
position.
Women
have
so
few
things
to
think
about,
men
so
many.
You
may
have
a
friendship
for
a
man,
while
he
is
almost
indifferent
to
you.
Much
of
what
cheers
your
life
may
be
dependent
on
him,
while
not
a
feeling
or
interest
of
moment
in
his
eyes
may
have
reference
to
you.
Robert
used
to
be
in
the
habit
of
going
to
London,
sometimes
for
a
week
or
a
fortnight
together.
Well,
while
he
was
away,
I
found
his
absence
a
void.
There
was
something
wanting;
Briarfield
was
duller.
Of
course,
I
had
my
usual
occupations;
still
I
missed
him.
As
I
sat
by
myself
in
the
evenings,
I
used
to
feel
a
strange
certainty
of
conviction
I
cannot
describe,
that
if
a
magician
or
a
genius
had,
at
that
moment,
offered
me
Prince
Ali's
tube
(you
remember
it
in
the
'Arabian
Nights'?),
and
if,
with
its
aid,
I
had
been
enabled
to
take
a
view
of
Robert
to
see
where
he
was,
how
occupied
I
should
have
learned,
in
a
startling
manner,
the
width
of
the
chasm
which
gaped
between
such
as
he
and
such
as
I.
I
knew
that,
however
my
thoughts
might
adhere
to
him,
his
were
effectually
sundered
from
