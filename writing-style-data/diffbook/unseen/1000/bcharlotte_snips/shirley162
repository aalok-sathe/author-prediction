Moore
had
perhaps
caught
the
fever,
which
for
a
few
days
laid
him
low,
in
one
of
the
poor
cottages
of
the
district,
which
he,
his
lame
pupil,
and
Mr.
Hall
were
in
the
habit
of
visiting
together.
At
any
rate
he
sickened,
and
after
opposing
to
the
malady
a
taciturn
resistance
for
a
day
or
two,
was
obliged
to
keep
his
chamber.
He
lay
tossing
on
his
thorny
bed
one
evening,
Henry,
who
would
not
quit
him,
watching
faithfully
beside
him,
when
a
tap
too
light
to
be
that
of
Mrs.
Gill
or
the
housemaid
summoned
young
Sympson
to
the
door.
"How
is
Mr.
Moore
to
night?"
asked
a
low
voice
from
the
dark
gallery.
"Come
in
and
see
him
yourself."
"Is
he
asleep?"
"I
wish
he
could
sleep.
Come
and
speak
to
him,
Shirley."
"He
would
not
like
it."
But
the
speaker
stepped
in,
and
Henry,
seeing
her
hesitate
on
the
threshold,
took
her
hand
and
drew
her
to
the
couch.
The
shaded
light
showed
Miss
Keeldar's
form
but
imperfectly;
yet
it
revealed
her
in
elegant
attire.
There
was
a
party
assembled
below,
including
Sir
Philip
Nunnely;
the
ladies
were
now
in
the
drawing
room,
and
their
hostess
had
stolen
from
them
to
visit
Henry's
tutor.
Her
pure
white
dress,
her
fair
arms
and
neck,
the
trembling
chainlet
of
gold
circling
her
throat
and
quivering
on
her
breast,
glistened
strangely
amid
the
obscurity
of
the
sickroom.
Her
mien
was
chastened
and
pensive.
She
spoke
gently.
"Mr.
Moore,
how
are
you
to
night?"
"I
have
not
been
very
ill,
and
am
now
better."
"I
heard
that
you
complained
of
thirst.
I
have
brought
you
some
grapes;
can
you
taste
one?"
"No;
but
I
thank
you
for
remembering
me."
"Just
one."
From
the
rich
cluster
that
filled
a
small
basket
held
in
her
hand
she
severed
a
berry
and
offered
it
to
his
lips.
He
shook
his
head,
and
turned
aside
his
flushed
face.
"But
what,
then,
can
I
bring
you
instead?
You
have
no
wish
for
fruit;
yet
I
see
that
your
lips
are
parched.
What
beverage
do
you
prefer?"
"Mrs.
Gill
supplies
me
with
toast
and
water.
I
like
it
best."
Silence
fell
for
some
minutes.
"Do
you
suffer?
have
you
pain?"
"Very
little."
"What
made
you
ill?"
Silence.
"I
wonder
what
caused
this
fever?
To
what
do
you
attribute
it?"
"Miasma,
perhaps
malaria.
This
is
autumn,
a
season
fertile
in
fevers."
"I
hear
you
often
visit
the
sick
in
Briarfield,
and
Nunnely
too,
with
Mr.
Hall.
You
should
be
on
your
guard;
temerity
is
not
wise."
"That
reminds
me,
Miss
Keeldar,
that
perhaps
you
had
better
not
enter
this
chamber
or
come
near
this
couch.
I
do
not
believe
my
illness
is
infectious.
I
scarcely
fear"
with
a
sort
of
smile
"you
will
take
it;
but
why
should
you
run
even
the
shadow
of
a
risk?
Leave
me."
"Patience,
I
will
go
soon;
but
I
should
like
to
do
something
for
you
before
I
depart
any
little
service
"
"They
will
miss
you
below."
"No;
the
gentlemen
are
still
at
table."
"They
will
not
linger
long.
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
is
no
wine
bibber,
and
I
hear
him
just
now
pass
from
the
dining
room
to
the
drawing
room."
"It
is
a
servant."
"It
is
Sir
Philip;
I
know
his
step."
"Your
hearing
is
acute."
"It
is
never
dull,
and
the
sense
seems
sharpened
at
present.
Sir
Philip
was
here
to
tea
last
night.
I
heard
you
sing
to
him
some
song
which
he
had
brought
you.
I
heard
him,
when
he
took
his
departure
at
eleven
o'clock,
call
you
out
on
to
the
pavement,
to
look
at
the
evening
star."
"You
must
be
nervously
sensitive."
"I
heard
him
kiss
your
hand."
"Impossible!"
"No:
my
chamber
is
over
the
hall,
the
window
just
above
the
front
door;
the
sash
was
a
little
raised,
for
I
felt
feverish.
You
stood
ten
minutes
with
him
on
the
steps.
I
heard
your
discourse,
every
word,
and
I
heard
the
salute.
Henry,
give
me
some
water."
"Let
me
give
it
him."
But
he
half
rose
to
take
the
glass
from
young
Sympson,
and
declined
her
attendance.
"And
can
I
do
nothing?"
"Nothing;
for
you
cannot
guarantee
me
a
night's
peaceful
rest,
and
it
is
all
I
at
present
want."
"You
do
not
sleep
well?"
"Sleep
has
left
me."
"Yet
you
said
you
were
not
very
ill?"
"I
am
often
sleepless
when
in
high
health."
"If
I
had
power,
I
would
lap
you
in
the
most
placid
slumber
quite
deep
and
hushed,
without
a
dream."
"Blank
annihilation!
I
do
not
ask
that."
"With
dreams
of
all
you
most
desire."
"Monstrous
delusions!
The
sleep
would
be
delirium,
the
waking
death."
"Your
wishes
are
not
so
chimerical;
you
are
no
visionary."
"Miss
Keeldar,
I
suppose
you
think
so;
but
my
character
is
not,
perhaps,
quite
as
legible
to
you
as
a
page
of
the
last
new
novel
might
be."
"That
is
possible.
But
this
sleep
I
should
like
to
woo
it
to
your
pillow,
to
win
for
you
its
favour.
If
I
took
a
book
and
sat
down
and
read
some
pages?
I
can
well
spare
half
an
hour."
"Thank
you,
but
I
will
not
detain
you."
"I
would
read
softly."
"It
would
not
do.
I
am
too
feverish
and
excitable
to
bear
a
soft,
cooing,
vibrating
voice
close
at
my
ear.
You
had
better
leave
me."
"Well,
I
will
go."
"And
no
good
night?"
"Yes,
sir,
yes.
Mr.
Moore,
good
night."
(Exit
Shirley.)
"Henry,
my
boy,
go
to
bed
now;
it
is
time
you
had
some
repose."
"Sir,
it
would
please
me
to
watch
at
your
bedside
all
night."
"Nothing
less
called
for.
I
am
getting
better.
There,
go."
"Give
me
your
blessing,
sir."
"God
bless
you,
my
best
pupil!"
"You
never
call
me
your
dearest
pupil!"
"No,
nor
ever
shall."
Possibly
Miss
Keeldar
resented
her
former
teacher's
rejection
of
her
courtesy.
It
is
certain
she
did
not
repeat
the
offer
of
it.
