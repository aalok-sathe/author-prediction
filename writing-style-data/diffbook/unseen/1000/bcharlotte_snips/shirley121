the
news
of
what
had
happened
at
the
Hollow
was
spread
all
over
the
neighbourhood.
Fanny,
who
had
been
to
Fieldhead
to
fetch
the
milk,
returned
in
panting
haste
with
tidings
that
there
had
been
a
battle
in
the
night
at
Mr.
Moore's
mill,
and
that
some
said
twenty
men
were
killed.
Eliza,
during
Fanny's
absence,
had
been
apprised
by
the
butcher's
boy
that
the
mill
was
burnt
to
the
ground.
Both
women
rushed
into
the
parlour
to
announce
these
terrible
facts
to
the
ladies,
terminating
their
clear
and
accurate
narrative
by
the
assertion
that
they
were
sure
master
must
have
been
in
it
all.
He
and
Thomas,
the
clerk,
they
were
confident,
must
have
gone
last
night
to
join
Mr.
Moore
and
the
soldiers.
Mr.
Malone,
too,
had
not
been
heard
of
at
his
lodgings
since
yesterday
afternoon;
and
Joe
Scott's
wife
and
family
were
in
the
greatest
distress,
wondering
what
had
become
of
their
head.
Scarcely
was
this
information
imparted
when
a
knock
at
the
kitchen
door
announced
the
Fieldhead
errand
boy,
arrived
in
hot
haste,
bearing
a
billet
from
Mrs.
Pryor.
It
was
hurriedly
written,
and
urged
Miss
Keeldar
to
return
directly,
as
the
neighbourhood
and
the
house
seemed
likely
to
be
all
in
confusion,
and
orders
would
have
to
be
given
which
the
mistress
of
the
hall
alone
could
regulate.
In
a
postscript
it
was
entreated
that
Miss
Helstone
might
not
be
left
alone
at
the
rectory.
She
had
better,
it
was
suggested,
accompany
Miss
Keeldar.
"There
are
not
two
opinions
on
that
head,"
said
Shirley,
as
she
tied
on
her
own
bonnet,
and
then
ran
to
fetch
Caroline's.
"But
what
will
Fanny
and
Eliza
do?
And
if
my
uncle
returns?"
"Your
uncle
will
not
return
yet;
he
has
other
fish
to
fry.
He
will
be
galloping
backwards
and
forwards
from
Briarfield
to
Stilbro'
all
day,
rousing
the
magistrates
in
the
court
house
and
the
officers
at
the
barracks;
and
Fanny
and
Eliza
can
have
in
Joe
Scott's
and
the
clerk's
wives
to
bear
them
company.
Besides,
of
course,
there
is
no
real
danger
to
be
apprehended
now.
Weeks
will
elapse
before
the
rioters
can
again
rally,
or
plan
any
other
attempt;
and
I
am
much
mistaken
if
Moore
and
Mr.
Helstone
will
not
take
advantage
of
last
night's
outbreak
to
quell
them
altogether.
They
will
frighten
the
authorities
of
Stilbro'
into
energetic
measures.
I
only
hope
they
will
not
be
too
severe
not
pursue
the
discomfited
too
relentlessly."
"Robert
will
not
be
cruel.
We
saw
that
last
night,"
said
Caroline.
"But
he
will
be
hard,"
retorted
Shirley;
"and
so
will
your
uncle."
As
they
hurried
along
the
meadow
and
plantation
path
to
Fieldhead,
they
saw
the
distant
highway
already
alive
with
an
unwonted
flow
of
equestrians
and
pedestrians,
tending
in
the
direction
of
the
usually
solitary
Hollow.
On
reaching
the
hall,
they
found
the
backyard
gates
open,
and
the
court
and
kitchen
seemed
crowded
with
excited
milk
fetchers
men,
women,
and
children
whom
Mrs.
Gill,
the
housekeeper,
appeared
vainly
persuading
to
take
their
milk
cans
and
depart.
(It
is,
or
was,
by
the
bye,
the
custom
in
the
north
of
England
for
the
cottagers
on
a
country
squire's
estate
to
receive
their
supplies
of
milk
and
butter
from
the
dairy
of
the
manor
house,
on
whose
pastures
a
herd
of
milch
kine
was
usually
fed
for
the
convenience
of
the
neighbourhood.
Miss
Keeldar
owned
such
a
herd
all
deep
dewlapped,
Craven
cows,
reared
on
the
sweet
herbage
and
clear
waters
of
bonny
Airedale;
and
very
proud
she
was
of
their
sleek
aspect
and
high
condition.)
Seeing
now
the
state
of
matters,
and
that
it
was
desirable
to
effect
a
clearance
of
the
premises,
Shirley
stepped
in
amongst
the
gossiping
groups.
She
bade
them
good
morning
with
a
certain
frank,
tranquil
ease
the
natural
characteristic
of
her
manner
when
she
addressed
numbers,
especially
if
those
numbers
belonged
to
the
working
class;
she
was
cooler
amongst
her
equals,
and
rather
proud
to
those
above
her.
She
then
asked
them
if
they
had
all
got
their
milk
measured
out;
and
understanding
that
they
had,
she
further
observed
that
she
"wondered
what
they
were
waiting
for,
then."
"We're
just
talking
a
bit
over
this
battle
there
has
been
at
your
mill,
mistress,"
replied
a
man.
"Talking
a
bit!
Just
like
you!"
said
Shirley.
"It
is
a
queer
thing
all
the
world
is
so
fond
of
talking
over
events.
You
talk
if
anybody
dies
suddenly;
you
talk
if
a
fire
breaks
out;
you
talk
if
a
mill
owner
fails;
you
talk
if
he's
murdered.
What
good
does
your
talking
do?"
There
is
nothing
the
lower
orders
like
better
than
a
little
downright
good
humoured
rating.
Flattery
they
scorn
very
much;
honest
abuse
they
enjoy.
They
call
it
speaking
plainly,
and
take
a
sincere
delight
in
being
the
objects
thereof.
The
homely
harshness
of
Miss
Keeldar's
salutation
won
her
the
ear
of
the
whole
throng
in
a
second.
"We're
no
war
nor
some
'at
is
aboon
us,
are
we?"
asked
a
man,
smiling.
"Nor
a
whit
better.
You
that
should
be
models
of
industry
are
just
as
gossip
loving
as
the
idle.
Fine,
rich
people
that
have
nothing
to
do
may
be
partly
excused
for
trifling
their
time
away;
you
who
have
to
earn
your
bread
with
the
sweat
of
your
brow
are
quite
inexcusable."
"That's
queer,
mistress.
Suld
we
never
have
a
holiday
because
we
work
hard?"
"Never,"
was
the
prompt
answer;
"unless,"
added
the
"mistress,"
with
a
smile
that
half
belied
the
severity
of
her
speech
"unless
you
knew
how
to
make
a
better
use
of
it
than
to
get
together
over
rum
and
tea
if
you
are
women,
or
over
beer
and
pipes
if
you
are
men,
and
talk
scandal
at
your
neighbours'
expense.
Come,
friends,"
she
added,
changing
at
once
from
bluntness
to
courtesy,
"oblige
me
by
taking
your
cans
and
going
home.
I
expect
several
persons
to
call
to
day,
and
it
will
be
inconvenient
to
