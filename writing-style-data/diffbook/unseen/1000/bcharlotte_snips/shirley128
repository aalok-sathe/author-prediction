compared
its
aspect
with
that
of
other
parts
of
England,
revealing
in
quiet,
unconscious
touches
of
description
a
sense
of
the
picturesque,
an
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
or
commonplace,
a
power
of
comparing
the
wild
with
the
cultured,
the
grand
with
the
tame,
that
gave
to
her
discourse
a
graphic
charm
as
pleasant
as
it
was
unpretending.
The
sort
of
reverent
pleasure
with
which
Caroline
listened
so
sincere,
so
quiet,
yet
so
evident
stirred
the
elder
lady's
faculties
to
gentle
animation.
Rarely,
probably,
had
she,
with
her
chill,
repellent
outside,
her
diffident
mien,
and
incommunicative
habits,
known
what
it
was
to
excite
in
one
whom
she
herself
could
love
feelings
of
earnest
affection
and
admiring
esteem.
Delightful,
doubtless,
was
the
consciousness
that
a
young
girl
towards
whom
it
seemed,
judging
by
the
moved
expression
of
her
eyes
and
features,
her
heart
turned
with
almost
a
fond
impulse,
looked
up
to
her
as
an
instructor,
and
clung
to
her
as
a
friend.
With
a
somewhat
more
marked
accent
of
interest
than
she
often
permitted
herself
to
use,
she
said,
as
she
bent
towards
her
youthful
companion,
and
put
aside
from
her
forehead
a
pale
brown
curl
which
had
strayed
from
the
confining
comb,
"I
do
hope
this
sweet
air
blowing
from
the
hill
will
do
you
good,
my
dear
Caroline.
I
wish
I
could
see
something
more
of
colour
in
these
cheeks;
but
perhaps
you
were
never
florid?"
"I
had
red
cheeks
once,"
returned
Miss
Helstone,
smiling.
"I
remember
a
year
two
years
ago
when
I
used
to
look
in
the
glass,
I
saw
a
different
face
there
to
what
I
see
now
rounder
and
rosier.
But
when
we
are
young,"
added
the
girl
of
eighteen,
"our
minds
are
careless
and
our
lives
easy."
"Do
you,"
continued
Mrs.
Pryor,
mastering
by
an
effort
that
tyrant
timidity
which
made
it
difficult
for
her,
even
under
present
circumstances,
to
attempt
the
scrutiny
of
another's
heart
"do
you,
at
your
age,
fret
yourself
with
cares
for
the
future?
Believe
me,
you
had
better
not.
Let
the
morrow
take
thought
for
the
things
of
itself."
"True,
dear
madam.
It
is
not
over
the
future
I
pine.
The
evil
of
the
day
is
sometimes
oppressive
too
oppressive
and
I
long
to
escape
it."
"That
is
the
evil
of
the
day
that
is
your
uncle
perhaps
is
not
you
find
it
difficult
to
understand
he
does
not
appreciate
"
Mrs.
Pryor
could
not
complete
her
broken
sentences;
she
could
not
manage
to
put
the
question
whether
Mr.
Helstone
was
too
harsh
with
his
niece.
But
Caroline
comprehended.
"Oh,
that
is
nothing,"
she
replied.
"My
uncle
and
I
get
on
very
well.
We
never
quarrel
I
don't
call
him
harsh
he
never
scolds
me.
Sometimes
I
wish
somebody
in
the
world
loved
me,
but
I
cannot
say
that
I
particularly
wish
him
to
have
more
affection
for
me
than
he
has.
As
a
child,
I
should
perhaps
have
felt
the
want
of
attention,
only
the
servants
were
very
kind
to
me;
but
when
people
are
long
indifferent
to
us,
we
grow
indifferent
to
their
indifference.
It
is
my
uncle's
way
not
to
care
for
women
and
girls,
unless
they
be
ladies
that
he
meets
in
company.
He
could
not
alter,
and
I
have
no
wish
that
he
should
alter,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned.
I
believe
it
would
merely
annoy
and
frighten
me
were
he
to
be
affectionate
towards
me
now.
But
you
know,
Mrs.
Pryor,
it
is
scarcely
living
to
measure
time
as
I
do
at
the
rectory.
The
hours
pass,
and
I
get
them
over
somehow,
but
I
do
not
live.
I
endure
existence,
but
I
rarely
enjoy
it.
Since
Miss
Keeldar
and
you
came
I
have
been
I
was
going
to
say
happier,
but
that
would
be
untrue."
She
paused.
"How
untrue?
You
are
fond
of
Miss
Keeldar,
are
you
not,
my
dear?"
"Very
fond
of
Shirley.
I
both
like
and
admire
her.
But
I
am
painfully
circumstanced.
For
a
reason
I
cannot
explain
I
want
to
go
away
from
this
place,
and
to
forget
it."
"You
told
me
before
you
wished
to
be
a
governess;
but,
my
dear,
if
you
remember,
I
did
not
encourage
the
idea.
I
have
been
a
governess
myself
great
part
of
my
life.
In
Miss
Keeldar's
acquaintance
I
esteem
myself
most
fortunate.
Her
talents
and
her
really
sweet
disposition
have
rendered
my
office
easy
to
me;
but
when
I
was
young,
before
I
married,
my
trials
were
severe,
poignant.
I
should
not
like
a
I
should
not
like
you
to
endure
similar
ones.
It
was
my
lot
to
enter
a
family
of
considerable
pretensions
to
good
birth
and
mental
superiority,
and
the
members
of
which
also
believed
that
'on
them
was
perceptible'
an
unusual
endowment
of
the
'Christian
graces;'
that
all
their
hearts
were
regenerate,
and
their
spirits
in
a
peculiar
state
of
discipline.
I
was
early
given
to
understand
that
'as
I
was
not
their
equal,'
so
I
could
not
expect
'to
have
their
sympathy.'
It
was
in
no
sort
concealed
from
me
that
I
was
held
a
'burden
and
a
restraint
in
society.'
The
gentlemen,
I
found,
regarded
me
as
a
'tabooed
woman,'
to
whom
'they
were
interdicted
from
granting
the
usual
privileges
of
the
sex,'
and
yet
'who
annoyed
them
by
frequently
crossing
their
path.'
The
ladies
too
made
it
plain
that
they
thought
me
'a
bore.'
The
servants,
it
was
signified,
'detested
me;'
why,
I
could
never
clearly
comprehend.
My
pupils,
I
was
told,
'however
much
they
might
love
me,
and
how
deep
soever
the
interest
I
might
take
in
them,
could
not
be
my
friends.'
It
was
intimated
that
I
must
'live
alone,
and
never
transgress
the
invisible
but
rigid
line
which
established
the
difference
between
me
and
my
employers.'
My
life
in
this
house
was
sedentary,
solitary,
constrained,
joyless,
toilsome.
The
dreadful
crushing
of
the
animal
spirits,
the
ever
prevailing
sense
of
friendlessness
and
homelessness
consequent
on
this
state
of
things
began
