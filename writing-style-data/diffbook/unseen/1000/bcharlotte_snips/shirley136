cherish
towards
them
and
that
others
should,
repels
them
with
a
sense
of
crude
romance.
The
first
movement,
in
short,
excited
by
such
discovery
(as
with
many
parents
on
finding
their
children
to
be
in
love)
is
one
of
mixed
impatience
and
contempt.
Reason
if
they
be
rational
people
corrects
the
false
feeling
in
time;
but
if
they
be
irrational,
it
is
never
corrected,
and
the
daughter
or
sister
in
law
is
disliked
to
the
end.
"You
would
expect
to
find
me
alone,
from
what
I
said
in
my
note,"
observed
Miss
Moore,
as
she
conducted
Caroline
towards
the
parlour;
"but
it
was
written
this
morning:
since
dinner,
company
has
come
in."
And
opening
the
door
she
made
visible
an
ample
spread
of
crimson
skirts
overflowing
the
elbow
chair
at
the
fireside,
and
above
them,
presiding
with
dignity,
a
cap
more
awful
than
a
crown.
That
cap
had
never
come
to
the
cottage
under
a
bonnet;
no,
it
had
been
brought
in
a
vast
bag,
or
rather
a
middle
sized
balloon
of
black
silk,
held
wide
with
whalebone.
The
screed,
or
frill
of
the
cap,
stood
a
quarter
of
a
yard
broad
round
the
face
of
the
wearer.
The
ribbon,
flourishing
in
puffs
and
bows
about
the
head,
was
of
the
sort
called
love
ribbon.
There
was
a
good
deal
of
it,
I
may
say,
a
very
great
deal.
Mrs.
Yorke
wore
the
cap
it
became
her;
she
wore
the
gown
also
it
suited
her
no
less.
That
great
lady
was
come
in
a
friendly
way
to
take
tea
with
Miss
Moore.
It
was
almost
as
great
and
as
rare
a
favour
as
if
the
queen
were
to
go
uninvited
to
share
pot
luck
with
one
of
her
subjects.
A
higher
mark
of
distinction
she
could
not
show
she
who
in
general
scorned
visiting
and
tea
drinking,
and
held
cheap
and
stigmatized
as
"gossips"
every
maid
and
matron
of
the
vicinage.
There
was
no
mistake,
however;
Miss
Moore
was
a
favourite
with
her.
She
had
evinced
the
fact
more
than
once
evinced
it
by
stopping
to
speak
to
her
in
the
churchyard
on
Sundays;
by
inviting
her,
almost
hospitably,
to
come
to
Briarmains;
evinced
it
to
day
by
the
grand
condescension
of
a
personal
visit.
Her
reasons
for
the
preference,
as
assigned
by
herself,
were
that
Miss
Moore
was
a
woman
of
steady
deportment,
without
the
least
levity
of
conversation
or
carriage;
also
that,
being
a
foreigner,
she
must
feel
the
want
of
a
friend
to
countenance
her.
She
might
have
added
that
her
plain
aspect,
homely,
precise
dress,
and
phlegmatic,
unattractive
manner
were
to
her
so
many
additional
recommendations.
It
is
certain,
at
least,
that
ladies
remarkable
for
the
opposite
qualities
of
beauty,
lively
bearing,
and
elegant
taste
in
attire
were
not
often
favoured
with
her
approbation.
Whatever
gentlemen
are
apt
to
admire
in
women,
Mrs.
Yorke
condemned;
and
what
they
overlook
or
despise,
she
patronized.
Caroline
advanced
to
the
mighty
matron
with
some
sense
of
diffidence.
She
knew
little
of
Mrs.
Yorke,
and,
as
a
parson's
niece,
was
doubtful
what
sort
of
a
reception
she
might
get.
She
got
a
very
cool
one,
and
was
glad
to
hide
her
discomfiture
by
turning
away
to
take
off
her
bonnet.
Nor,
upon
sitting
down,
was
she
displeased
to
be
immediately
accosted
by
a
little
personage
in
a
blue
frock
and
sash,
who
started
up
like
some
fairy
from
the
side
of
the
great
dame's
chair,
where
she
had
been
sitting
on
a
footstool,
screened
from
view
by
the
folds
of
the
wide
red
gown,
and
running
to
Miss
Helstone,
unceremoniously
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
demanded
a
kiss.
"My
mother
is
not
civil
to
you,"
said
the
petitioner,
as
she
received
and
repaid
a
smiling
salute,
"and
Rose
there
takes
no
notice
of
you;
it
is
their
way.
If,
instead
of
you,
a
white
angel,
with
a
crown
of
stars,
had
come
into
the
room,
mother
would
nod
stiffly,
and
Rose
never
lift
her
head
at
all;
but
I
will
be
your
friend
I
have
always
liked
you."
"Jessie,
curb
that
tongue
of
yours,
and
repress
your
forwardness!"
said
Mrs.
Yorke.
"But,
mother,
you
are
so
frozen!"
expostulated
Jessie.
"Miss
Helstone
has
never
done
you
any
harm;
why
can't
you
be
kind
to
her?
You
sit
so
stiff,
and
look
so
cold,
and
speak
so
dry
what
for?
That's
just
the
fashion
in
which
you
treat
Miss
Shirley
Keeldar
and
every
other
young
lady
who
comes
to
our
house.
And
Rose
there
is
such
an
aut
aut
I
have
forgotten
the
word,
but
it
means
a
machine
in
the
shape
of
a
human
being.
However,
between
you,
you
will
drive
every
soul
away
from
Briarmains;
Martin
often
says
so."
"I
am
an
automaton?
Good!
Let
me
alone,
then,"
said
Rose,
speaking
from
a
corner
where
she
was
sitting
on
the
carpet
at
the
foot
of
a
bookcase,
with
a
volume
spread
open
on
her
knee.
"Miss
Helstone,
how
do
you
do?"
she
added,
directing
a
brief
glance
to
the
person
addressed,
and
then
again
casting
down
her
gray,
remarkable
eyes
on
the
book
and
returning
to
the
study
of
its
pages.
Caroline
stole
a
quiet
gaze
towards
her,
dwelling
on
her
young,
absorbed
countenance,
and
observing
a
certain
unconscious
movement
of
the
mouth
as
she
read
a
movement
full
of
character.
Caroline
had
tact,
and
she
had
fine
instinct.
She
felt
that
Rose
Yorke
was
a
peculiar
child
one
of
the
unique;
she
knew
how
to
treat
her.
Approaching
quietly,
she
knelt
on
the
carpet
at
her
side,
and
looked
over
her
little
shoulder
at
her
book.
It
was
a
romance
of
Mrs.
Radcliffe's
"The
Italian."
Caroline
read
on
with
her,
making
no
remark.
Presently
Rose
showed
her
the
attention
of
asking,
ere
she
turned
the
leaf,
"Are
you
ready?"
Caroline
only
nodded.
"Do
you
like
it?"
inquired
Rose
ere
long.
"Long
since,
when
I
read
it
as
a
child,
I
was
wonderfully
taken
with
it."
"Why?"
"It
