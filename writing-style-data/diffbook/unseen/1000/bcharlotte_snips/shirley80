companion
turned
into
a
path
that
lay
nearer
the
gate.
Some
of
their
conversation
became
audible.
Caroline
would
not
stay
to
listen.
She
passed
away
noiselessly,
and
the
moonlight
kissed
the
wall
which
her
shadow
had
dimmed.
The
reader
is
privileged
to
remain,
and
try
what
he
can
make
of
the
discourse.
"I
cannot
conceive
why
nature
did
not
give
you
a
bulldog's
head,
for
you
have
all
a
bulldog's
tenacity,"
said
Shirley.
"Not
a
flattering
idea.
Am
I
so
ignoble?"
"And
something
also
you
have
of
the
same
animal's
silent
ways
of
going
about
its
work.
You
give
no
warning;
you
come
noiselessly
behind,
seize
fast,
and
hold
on."
"This
is
guess
work.
You
have
witnessed
no
such
feat
on
my
part.
In
your
presence
I
have
been
no
bulldog."
"Your
very
silence
indicates
your
race.
How
little
you
talk
in
general,
yet
how
deeply
you
scheme!
You
are
far
seeing;
you
are
calculating."
"I
know
the
ways
of
these
people.
I
have
gathered
information
of
their
intentions.
My
note
last
night
informed
you
that
Barraclough's
trial
had
ended
in
his
conviction
and
sentence
to
transportation.
His
associates
will
plot
vengeance.
I
shall
lay
my
plans
so
as
to
counteract
or
at
least
be
prepared
for
theirs
that
is
all.
Having
now
given
you
as
clear
an
explanation
as
I
can,
am
I
to
understand
that
for
what
I
propose
doing
I
have
your
approbation?"
"I
shall
stand
by
you
so
long
as
you
remain
on
the
defensive.
Yes."
"Good!
Without
any
aid
even
opposed
or
disapproved
by
you
I
believe
I
should
have
acted
precisely
as
I
now
intend
to
act,
but
in
another
spirit.
I
now
feel
satisfied.
On
the
whole,
I
relish
the
position."
"I
dare
say
you
do.
That
is
evident.
You
relish
the
work
which
lies
before
you
still
better
than
you
would
relish
the
execution
of
a
government
order
for
army
cloth."
"I
certainly
feel
it
congenial."
"So
would
old
Helstone.
It
is
true
there
is
a
shade
of
difference
in
your
motives
many
shades,
perhaps.
Shall
I
speak
to
Mr.
Helstone?
I
will,
if
you
like."
"Act
as
you
please.
Your
judgment,
Miss
Keeldar,
will
guide
you
accurately.
I
could
rely
on
it
myself
in
a
more
difficult
crisis.
But
I
should
inform
you
Mr.
Helstone
is
somewhat
prejudiced
against
me
at
present."
"I
am
aware
I
have
heard
all
about
your
differences.
Depend
upon
it,
they
will
melt
away.
He
cannot
resist
the
temptation
of
an
alliance
under
present
circumstances."
"I
should
be
glad
to
have
him;
he
is
of
true
metal."
"I
think
so
also."
"An
old
blade,
and
rusty
somewhat,
but
the
edge
and
temper
still
excellent."
"Well,
you
shall
have
him,
Mr.
Moore
that
is,
if
I
can
win
him."
"Whom
can
you
not
win?"
"Perhaps
not
the
rector;
but
I
will
make
the
effort."
"Effort!
He
will
yield
for
a
word
a
smile."
"By
no
means.
It
will
cost
me
several
cups
of
tea,
some
toast
and
cake,
and
an
ample
measure
of
remonstrances,
expostulations,
and
persuasions.
It
grows
rather
chill."
"I
perceive
you
shiver.
Am
I
acting
wrongly
to
detain
you
here?
Yet
it
is
so
calm
I
even
feel
it
warm
and
society
such
as
yours
is
a
pleasure
to
me
so
rare.
If
you
were
wrapped
in
a
thicker
shawl
"
"I
might
stay
longer,
and
forget
how
late
it
is,
which
would
chagrin
Mrs.
Pryor.
We
keep
early
and
regular
hours
at
Fieldhead,
Mr.
Moore;
and
so,
I
am
sure,
does
your
sister
at
the
cottage."
"Yes;
but
Hortense
and
I
have
an
understanding
the
most
convenient
in
the
world,
that
we
shall
each
do
as
we
please."
"How
do
you
please
to
do?"
"Three
nights
in
the
week
I
sleep
in
the
mill
but
I
require
little
rest
and
when
it
is
moonlight
and
mild
I
often
haunt
the
Hollow
till
daybreak."
"When
I
was
a
very
little
girl,
Mr.
Moore,
my
nurse
used
to
tell
me
tales
of
fairies
being
seen
in
that
Hollow.
That
was
before
my
father
built
the
mill,
when
it
was
a
perfectly
solitary
ravine.
You
will
be
falling
under
enchantment."
"I
fear
it
is
done,"
said
Moore,
in
a
low
voice.
"But
there
are
worse
things
than
fairies
to
be
guarded
against,"
pursued
Miss
Keeldar.
"Things
more
perilous,"
he
subjoined.
"Far
more
so.
For
instance,
how
would
you
like
to
meet
Michael
Hartley,
that
mad
Calvinist
and
Jacobin
weaver?
They
say
he
is
addicted
to
poaching,
and
often
goes
abroad
at
night
with
his
gun."
"I
have
already
had
the
luck
to
meet
him.
We
held
a
long
argument
together
one
night.
A
strange
little
incident
it
was;
I
liked
it."
"Liked
it?
I
admire
your
taste!
Michael
is
not
sane.
Where
did
you
meet
him?"
"In
the
deepest,
shadiest
spot
in
the
glen,
where
the
water
runs
low,
under
brushwood.
We
sat
down
near
that
plank
bridge.
It
was
moonlight,
but
clouded,
and
very
windy.
We
had
a
talk."
"On
politics?"
"And
religion.
I
think
the
moon
was
at
the
full,
and
Michael
was
as
near
crazed
as
possible.
He
uttered
strange
blasphemy
in
his
Antinomian
fashion."
"Excuse
me,
but
I
think
you
must
have
been
nearly
as
mad
as
he,
to
sit
listening
to
him."
"There
is
a
wild
interest
in
his
ravings.
The
man
would
be
half
a
poet,
if
he
were
not
wholly
a
maniac;
and
perhaps
a
prophet,
if
he
were
not
a
profligate.
He
solemnly
informed
me
that
hell
was
foreordained
my
inevitable
portion;
that
he
read
the
mark
of
the
beast
on
my
brow;
that
I
had
been
an
outcast
from
the
beginning.
God's
vengeance,
he
said,
was
preparing
for
me,
and
affirmed
that
in
a
vision
of
the
night
he
had
beheld
the
manner
and
the
instrument
of
my
doom.
I
wanted
to
know
further,
but
he
left
me
with
these
words,
'The
end
is
not
yet.'"
"Have
you
ever
seen
him
since?"
"About
a
month
afterwards,
in
