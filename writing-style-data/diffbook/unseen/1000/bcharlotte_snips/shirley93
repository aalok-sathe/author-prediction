its
depths
troubled
by
the
reflection.
When
Miss
Ainley
arrived,
she
was
made
kindly
welcome
by
every
one.
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Margaret
Hall
made
room
for
her
on
the
sofa
between
them;
and
when
the
three
were
seated,
they
formed
a
trio
which
the
gay
and
thoughtless
would
have
scorned,
indeed,
as
quite
worthless
and
unattractive
a
middle
aged
widow
and
two
plain,
spectacled
old
maids
yet
which
had
its
own
quiet
value,
as
many
a
suffering
and
friendless
human
being
knew.
Shirley
opened
the
business
and
showed
the
plan.
"I
know
the
hand
which
drew
up
that,"
said
Mr.
Hall,
glancing
at
Miss
Ainley,
and
smiling
benignantly.
His
approbation
was
won
at
once.
Boultby
heard
and
deliberated
with
bent
brow
and
protruded
under
lip.
His
consent
he
considered
too
weighty
to
be
given
in
a
hurry.
Helstone
glanced
sharply
round
with
an
alert,
suspicious
expression,
as
if
he
apprehended
that
female
craft
was
at
work,
and
that
something
in
petticoats
was
somehow
trying
underhand
to
acquire
too
much
influence,
and
make
itself
of
too
much
importance.
Shirley
caught
and
comprehended
the
expression.
"This
scheme
is
nothing,"
said
she
carelessly.
"It
is
only
an
outline
a
mere
suggestion.
You,
gentlemen,
are
requested
to
draw
up
rules
of
your
own."
And
she
directly
fetched
her
writing
case,
smiling
queerly
to
herself
as
she
bent
over
the
table
where
it
stood.
She
produced
a
sheet
of
paper,
a
new
pen,
drew
an
arm
chair
to
the
table,
and
presenting
her
hand
to
old
Helstone,
begged
permission
to
install
him
in
it.
For
a
minute
he
was
a
little
stiff,
and
stood
wrinkling
his
copper
coloured
forehead
strangely.
At
last
he
muttered,
"Well,
you
are
neither
my
wife
nor
my
daughter,
so
I'll
be
led
for
once;
but
mind
I
know
I
am
led.
Your
little
female
maneauvres
don't
blind
me."
"Oh!"
said
Shirley,
dipping
the
pen
in
the
ink,
and
putting
it
into
his
hand,
"you
must
regard
me
as
Captain
Keeldar
to
day.
This
is
quite
a
gentleman's
affair
yours
and
mine
entirely,
doctor"
(so
she
had
dubbed
the
rector).
"The
ladies
there
are
only
to
be
our
aides
de
camp,
and
at
their
peril
they
speak,
till
we
have
settled
the
whole
business."
He
smiled
a
little
grimly,
and
began
to
write.
He
soon
interrupted
himself
to
ask
questions,
and
consult
his
brethren,
disdainfully
lifting
his
glance
over
the
curly
heads
of
the
two
girls
and
the
demure
caps
of
the
elder
ladies,
to
meet
the
winking
glasses
and
gray
pates
of
the
priests.
In
the
discussion
which
ensued,
all
three
gentlemen,
to
their
infinite
credit,
showed
a
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
poor
of
their
parishes
an
even
minute
knowledge
of
their
separate
wants.
Each
rector
knew
where
clothing
was
needed,
where
food
would
be
most
acceptable,
where
money
could
be
bestowed
with
a
probability
of
it
being
judiciously
laid
out.
Wherever
their
memories
fell
short,
Miss
Ainley
or
Miss
Hall,
if
applied
to,
could
help
them
out;
but
both
ladies
took
care
not
to
speak
unless
spoken
to.
Neither
of
them
wanted
to
be
foremost,
but
each
sincerely
desired
to
be
useful;
and
useful
the
clergy
consented
to
make
them
with
which
boon
they
were
content.
Shirley
stood
behind
the
rectors,
leaning
over
their
shoulders
now
and
then
to
glance
at
the
rules
drawn
up
and
the
list
of
cases
making
out,
listening
to
all
they
said,
and
still
at
intervals
smiling
her
queer
smile
a
smile
not
ill
natured,
but
significant
too
significant
to
be
generally
thought
amiable.
Men
rarely
like
such
of
their
fellows
as
read
their
inward
nature
too
clearly
and
truly.
It
is
good
for
women,
especially,
to
be
endowed
with
a
soft
blindness;
to
have
mild,
dim
eyes,
that
never
penetrate
below
the
surface
of
things
that
take
all
for
what
it
seems.
Thousands,
knowing
this,
keep
their
eyelids
drooped
on
system;
but
the
most
downcast
glance
has
its
loophole,
through
which
it
can,
on
occasion,
take
its
sentinel
survey
of
life.
I
remember
once
seeing
a
pair
of
blue
eyes,
that
were
usually
thought
sleepy,
secretly
on
the
alert,
and
I
knew
by
their
expression
an
expression
which
chilled
my
blood,
it
was
in
that
quarter
so
wondrously
unexpected
that
for
years
they
had
been
accustomed
to
silent
soul
reading.
The
world
called
the
owner
of
these
blue
eyes
bonne
petite
femme
(she
was
not
an
Englishwoman).
I
learned
her
nature
afterwards
got
it
off
by
heart
studied
it
in
its
farthest,
most
hidden
recesses.
She
was
the
finest,
deepest,
subtlest
schemer
in
Europe.
When
all
was
at
length
settled
to
Miss
Keeldar's
mind,
and
the
clergy
had
entered
so
fully
into
the
spirit
of
her
plans
as
to
head
the
subscription
list
with
their
signatures
for
50
each,
she
ordered
supper
to
be
served,
having
previously
directed
Mrs.
Gill
to
exercise
her
utmost
skill
in
the
preparation
of
this
repast.
Mr.
Hall
was
no
bon
vivant
he
was
naturally
an
abstemious
man,
indifferent
to
luxury;
but
Boultby
and
Helstone
both
liked
good
cookery.
The
recherche
supper
consequently
put
them
into
excellent
humour.
They
did
justice
to
it,
though
in
a
gentlemanly
way
not
in
the
mode
Mr.
Donne
would
have
done
had
he
been
present.
A
glass
of
fine
wine
was
likewise
tasted,
with
discerning
though
most
decorous
relish.
Captain
Keeldar
was
complimented
on
his
taste;
the
compliment
charmed
him.
It
had
been
his
aim
to
gratify
and
satisfy
his
priestly
guests.
He
had
succeeded,
and
was
radiant
with
glee.
The
next
day
Shirley
expressed
to
Caroline
how
delighted
she
felt
that
the
little
party
had
gone
off
so
well.
"I
rather
like
to
entertain
a
circle
of
gentlemen,"
said
she.
"It
is
amusing
to
observe
how
they
enjoy
a
judiciously
concocted
repast.
For
ourselves,
you
see,
these
choice
wines
and
these
scientific
dishes
are
of
no
importance
to
us;
but
gentlemen
seem
to
retain
something
of
the
naivete
of
children
about
food,
and
one
likes
to
please
them
that
is,
when
