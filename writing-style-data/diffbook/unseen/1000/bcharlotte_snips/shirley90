more
freshly
when
the
pressure
is
removed;
affection
that
no
passion
can
ultimately
outrival,
with
which
even
love
itself
cannot
do
more
than
compete
in
force
and
truth.
Love
hurts
us
so,
Shirley.
It
is
so
tormenting,
so
racking,
and
it
burns
away
our
strength
with
its
flame.
In
affection
is
no
pain
and
no
fire,
only
sustenance
and
balm.
I
am
supported
and
soothed
when
you
that
is,
you
only
are
near,
Shirley.
Do
you
believe
me
now?"
"I
am
always
easy
of
belief
when
the
creed
pleases
me.
We
really
are
friends,
then,
Lina,
in
spite
of
the
black
eclipse?"
"We
really
are,"
returned
the
other,
drawing
Shirley
towards
her,
and
making
her
sit
down,
"chance
what
may."
"Come,
then;
we
will
talk
of
something
else
than
the
Troubler."
But
at
this
moment
the
rector
came
in,
and
the
"something
else"
of
which
Miss
Keeldar
was
about
to
talk
was
not
again
alluded
to
till
the
moment
of
her
departure.
She
then
delayed
a
few
minutes
in
the
passage
to
say,
"Caroline,
I
wish
to
tell
you
that
I
have
a
great
weight
on
my
mind;
my
conscience
is
quite
uneasy
as
if
I
had
committed,
or
was
going
to
commit,
a
crime.
It
is
not
my
private
conscience,
you
must
understand,
but
my
landed
proprietor
and
lord
of
the
manor
conscience.
I
have
got
into
the
clutch
of
an
eagle
with
iron
talons.
I
have
fallen
under
a
stern
influence,
which
I
scarcely
approve,
but
cannot
resist.
Something
will
be
done
ere
long,
I
fear,
which
it
by
no
means
pleases
me
to
think
of.
To
ease
my
mind,
and
to
prevent
harm
as
far
as
I
can,
I
mean
to
enter
on
a
series
of
good
works.
Don't
be
surprised,
therefore,
if
you
see
me
all
at
once
turn
outrageously
charitable.
I
have
no
idea
how
to
begin,
but
you
must
give
me
some
advice.
We
will
talk
more
on
the
subject
to
morrow;
and
just
ask
that
excellent
person,
Miss
Ainley,
to
step
up
to
Fieldhead.
I
have
some
notion
of
putting
myself
under
her
tuition.
Won't
she
have
a
precious
pupil?
Drop
a
hint
to
her,
Lina,
that,
though
a
well
meaning,
I
am
rather
a
neglected
character,
and
then
she
will
feel
less
scandalized
at
my
ignorance
about
clothing
societies
and
such
things."
On
the
morrow
Caroline
found
Shirley
sitting
gravely
at
her
desk,
with
an
account
book,
a
bundle
of
banknotes,
and
a
well
filled
purse
before
her.
She
was
looking
mighty
serious,
but
a
little
puzzled.
She
said
she
had
been
"casting
an
eye"
over
the
weekly
expenditure
in
housekeeping
at
the
hall,
trying
to
find
out
where
she
could
retrench;
that
she
had
also
just
given
audience
to
Mrs.
Gill,
the
cook,
and
had
sent
that
person
away
with
a
notion
that
her
(Shirley's)
brain
was
certainly
crazed.
"I
have
lectured
her
on
the
duty
of
being
careful,"
said
she,
"in
a
way
quite
new
to
her.
So
eloquent
was
I
on
the
text
of
economy
that
I
surprised
myself;
for,
you
see,
it
is
altogether
a
fresh
idea.
I
never
thought,
much
less
spoke,
on
the
subject
till
lately.
But
it
is
all
theory;
for
when
I
came
to
the
practical
part
I
could
retrench
nothing.
I
had
not
firmness
to
take
off
a
single
pound
of
butter,
or
to
prosecute
to
any
clear
result
an
inquest
into
the
destiny
of
either
dripping,
lard,
bread,
cold
meat,
or
other
kitchen
perquisite
whatever.
I
know
we
never
get
up
illuminations
at
Fieldhead,
but
I
could
not
ask
the
meaning
of
sundry
quite
unaccountable
pounds
of
candles.
We
do
not
wash
for
the
parish,
yet
I
viewed
in
silence
items
of
soap
and
bleaching
powder
calculated
to
satisfy
the
solicitude
of
the
most
anxious
inquirer
after
our
position
in
reference
to
those
articles.
Carnivorous
I
am
not,
nor
is
Mrs.
Pryor,
nor
is
Mrs.
Gill
herself,
yet
I
only
hemmed
and
opened
my
eyes
a
little
wide
when
I
saw
butchers'
bills
whose
figures
seemed
to
prove
that
fact
falsehood,
I
mean.
Caroline,
you
may
laugh
at
me,
but
you
can't
change
me.
I
am
a
poltroon
on
certain
points;
I
feel
it.
There
is
a
base
alloy
of
moral
cowardice
in
my
composition.
I
blushed
and
hung
my
head
before
Mrs.
Gill,
when
she
ought
to
have
been
faltering
confessions
to
me.
I
found
it
impossible
to
get
up
the
spirit
even
to
hint,
much
less
to
prove,
to
her
that
she
was
a
cheat.
I
have
no
calm
dignity,
no
true
courage
about
me."
"Shirley,
what
fit
of
self
injustice
is
this?
My
uncle,
who
is
not
given
to
speak
well
of
women,
says
there
are
not
ten
thousand
men
in
England
as
genuinely
fearless
as
you."
"I
am
fearless,
physically;
I
am
never
nervous
about
danger.
I
was
not
startled
from
self
possession
when
Mr.
Wynne's
great
red
bull
rose
with
a
bellow
before
my
face,
as
I
was
crossing
the
cowslip
lea
alone,
stooped
his
begrimed,
sullen
head,
and
made
a
run
at
me;
but
I
was
afraid
of
seeing
Mrs.
Gill
brought
to
shame
and
confusion
of
face.
You
have
twice
ten
times
my
strength
of
mind
on
certain
subjects,
Caroline.
You,
whom
no
persuasion
can
induce
to
pass
a
bull,
however
quiet
he
looks,
would
have
firmly
shown
my
housekeeper
she
had
done
wrong;
then
you
would
have
gently
and
wisely
admonished
her;
and
at
last,
I
dare
say,
provided
she
had
seemed
penitent,
you
would
have
very
sweetly
forgiven
her.
Of
this
conduct
I
am
incapable.
However,
in
spite
of
exaggerated
imposition,
I
still
find
we
live
within
our
means.
I
have
money
in
hand,
and
I
really
must
do
some
good
with
it.
The
Briarfield
poor
are
badly
off;
they
must
be
helped.
What
ought
I
to
do,
think
you,
Lina?
Had
I
not
better
distribute
the
cash
at
once?"
"No,
indeed,
Shirley;
you
will
not
manage
properly.
I
have
often
noticed
that
