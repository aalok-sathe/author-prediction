grew
so
thin
as
thin
as
you
are
now.
I
could
do
nothing
for
myself
neither
rise
nor
lie
down;
and
I
could
not
eat.
Yet
you
see
I
am
better."
"Comforter
sad
as
sweet.
I
am
too
feeble
to
say
what
I
feel;
but
while
you
speak
I
do
feel."
"Here
I
am
at
your
side,
where
I
thought
never
more
to
be.
Here
I
speak
to
you.
I
see
you
listen
to
me
willingly
look
at
me
kindly.
Did
I
count
on
that?
I
despaired."
Moore
sighed
a
sigh
so
deep
it
was
nearly
a
groan.
He
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand.
"May
I
be
spared
to
make
some
atonement."
Such
was
his
prayer.
"And
for
what?"
"We
will
not
touch
on
it
now,
Cary;
unmanned
as
I
am,
I
have
not
the
power
to
cope
with
such
a
topic.
Was
Mrs.
Pryor
with
you
during
your
illness?"
"Yes"
Caroline
smiled
brightly
"you
know
she
is
mamma?"
"I
have
heard
Hortense
told
me;
but
that
tale
too
I
will
receive
from
yourself.
Does
she
add
to
your
happiness?"
"What!
mamma?
She
is
dear
to
me;
how
dear
I
cannot
say.
I
was
altogether
weary,
and
she
held
me
up."
"I
deserve
to
hear
that
in
a
moment
when
I
can
scarce
lift
my
hand
to
my
head.
I
deserve
it."
"It
is
no
reproach
against
you."
"It
is
a
coal
of
fire
heaped
on
my
head;
and
so
is
every
word
you
address
to
me,
and
every
look
that
lights
your
sweet
face.
Come
still
nearer,
Lina;
and
give
me
your
hand
if
my
thin
fingers
do
not
scare
you."
She
took
those
thin
fingers
between
her
two
little
hands;
she
bent
her
head
et
les
effleura
de
ses
levres.
(I
put
that
in
French
because
the
word
effleurer
is
an
exquisite
word.)
Moore
was
much
moved.
A
large
tear
or
two
coursed
down
his
hollow
cheek.
"I'll
keep
these
things
in
my
heart,
Cary;
that
kiss
I
will
put
by,
and
you
shall
hear
of
it
again
one
day."
"Come
out!"
cried
Martin,
opening
the
door
"come
away;
you
have
had
twenty
minutes
instead
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour."
"She
will
not
stir
yet,
you
hempseed."
"I
dare
not
stay
longer,
Robert."
"Can
you
promise
to
return?"
"No,
she
can't,"
responded
Martin.
"The
thing
mustn't
become
customary.
I
can't
be
troubled.
It's
very
well
for
once;
I'll
not
have
it
repeated."
"You'll
not
have
it
repeated."
"Hush!
don't
vex
him;
we
could
not
have
met
to
day
but
for
him.
But
I
will
come
again,
if
it
is
your
wish
that
I
should
come."
"It
is
my
wish
my
one
wish
almost
the
only
wish
I
can
feel."
"Come
this
minute.
My
mother
has
coughed,
got
up,
set
her
feet
on
the
floor.
Let
her
only
catch
you
on
the
stairs,
Miss
Caroline.
You're
not
to
bid
him
good
bye"
stepping
between
her
and
Moore
"you
are
to
march."
"My
shawl,
Martin."
"I
have
it.
I'll
put
it
on
for
you
when
you
are
in
the
hall."
He
made
them
part.
He
would
suffer
no
farewell
but
what
could
be
expressed
in
looks.
He
half
carried
Caroline
down
the
stairs.
In
the
hall
he
wrapped
her
shawl
round
her,
and,
but
that
his
mother's
tread
then
creaked
in
the
gallery,
and
but
that
a
sentiment
of
diffidence
the
proper,
natural,
therefore
the
noble
impulse
of
his
boy's
heart
held
him
back,
he
would
have
claimed
his
reward;
he
would
have
said,
"Now,
Miss
Caroline,
for
all
this
give
me
one
kiss."
But
ere
the
words
had
passed
his
lips
she
was
across
the
snowy
road,
rather
skimming
than
wading
the
drifts.
"She
is
my
debtor,
and
I
will
be
paid."
He
flattered
himself
that
it
was
opportunity,
not
audacity,
which
had
failed
him.
He
misjudged
the
quality
of
his
own
nature,
and
held
it
for
something
lower
than
it
was.
IN
THE
DISCHARGE
OF
RELIGIOUS
DUTIES.
Martin,
having
known
the
taste
of
excitement,
wanted
a
second
draught;
having
felt
the
dignity
of
power,
he
loathed
to
relinquish
it.
Miss
Helstone
that
girl
he
had
always
called
ugly,
and
whose
face
was
now
perpetually
before
his
eyes,
by
day
and
by
night,
in
dark
and
in
sunshine
had
once
come
within
his
sphere.
It
fretted
him
to
think
the
visit
might
never
be
repeated.
Though
a
schoolboy
he
was
no
ordinary
schoolboy;
he
was
destined
to
grow
up
an
original.
At
a
few
years'
later
date
he
took
great
pains
to
pare
and
polish
himself
down
to
the
pattern
of
the
rest
of
the
world,
but
he
never
succeeded;
an
unique
stamp
marked
him
always.
He
now
sat
idle
at
his
desk
in
the
grammar
school,
casting
about
in
his
mind
for
the
means
of
adding
another
chapter
to
his
commenced
romance.
He
did
not
yet
know
how
many
commenced
life
romances
are
doomed
never
to
get
beyond
the
first,
or
at
most
the
second
chapter.
His
Saturday
half
holiday
he
spent
in
the
wood
with
his
book
of
fairy
legends,
and
that
other
unwritten
book
of
his
imagination.
Martin
harboured
an
irreligious
reluctance
to
see
the
approach
of
Sunday.
His
father
and
mother,
while
disclaiming
community
with
the
Establishment,
failed
not
duly,
once
on
the
sacred
day,
to
fill
their
large
pew
in
Briarfield
Church
with
the
whole
of
their
blooming
family.
Theoretically,
Mr.
Yorke
placed
all
sects
and
churches
on
a
level.
Mrs.
Yorke
awarded
the
palm
to
Moravians
and
Quakers,
on
account
of
that
crown
of
humility
by
these
worthies
worn.
Neither
of
them
were
ever
known,
however,
to
set
foot
in
a
conventicle.
Martin,
I
say,
disliked
Sunday,
because
the
morning
service
was
long,
and
the
sermon
usually
little
to
his
taste.
This
Saturday
afternoon,
however,
his
woodland
musings
disclosed
to
him
a
new
found
charm
in
the
coming
day.
It
proved
a
day
of
deep
snow
so
deep
that
Mrs.
Yorke
during
breakfast
announced
her
conviction
that
the
children,
both
boys
