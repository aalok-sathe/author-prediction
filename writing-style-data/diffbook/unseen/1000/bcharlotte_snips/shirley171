Keeldar,
to
send
for
you
that
is,
to
ask
an
interview
of
a
few
minutes."
She
waited;
she
plied
her
needle.
"Well,
sir"
(not
lifting
her
eyes),
"what
about?"
"Be
seated
first.
The
subject
I
would
broach
is
one
of
some
moment.
Perhaps
I
have
hardly
a
right
to
approach
it.
It
is
possible
I
ought
to
frame
an
apology;
it
is
possible
no
apology
can
excuse
me.
The
liberty
I
have
taken
arises
from
a
conversation
with
Henry.
The
boy
is
unhappy
about
your
health;
all
your
friends
are
unhappy
on
that
subject.
It
is
of
your
health
I
would
speak."
"I
am
quite
well,"
she
said
briefly.
"Yet
changed."
"That
matters
to
none
but
myself.
We
all
change."
"Will
you
sit
down?
Formerly,
Miss
Keeldar,
I
had
some
influence
with
you:
have
I
any
now?
May
I
feel
that
what
I
am
saying
is
not
accounted
positive
presumption?"
"Let
me
read
some
French,
Mr.
Moore,
or
I
will
even
take
a
spell
at
the
Latin
grammar,
and
let
us
proclaim
a
truce
to
all
sanitary
discussions."
"No,
no.
It
is
time
there
were
discussions."
"Discuss
away,
then,
but
do
not
choose
me
for
your
text.
I
am
a
healthy
subject."
"Do
you
not
think
it
wrong
to
affirm
and
reaffirm
what
is
substantially
untrue?"
"I
say
I
am
well.
I
have
neither
cough,
pain,
nor
fever."
"Is
there
no
equivocation
in
that
assertion?
Is
it
the
direct
truth?"
"The
direct
truth."
Louis
Moore
looked
at
her
earnestly.
"I
can
myself,"
he
said,
"trace
no
indications
of
actual
disease.
But
why,
then,
are
you
altered?"
"Am
I
altered?"
"We
will
try.
We
will
seek
a
proof."
"How?"
"I
ask,
in
the
first
place,
do
you
sleep
as
you
used
to?"
"I
do
not;
but
it
is
not
because
I
am
ill."
"Have
you
the
appetite
you
once
had?"
"No;
but
it
is
not
because
I
am
ill."
"You
remember
this
little
ring
fastened
to
my
watch
chain?
It
was
my
mother's,
and
is
too
small
to
pass
the
joint
of
my
little
finger.
You
have
many
a
time
sportively
purloined
it.
It
fitted
your
fore
finger.
Try
now."
She
permitted
the
test.
The
ring
dropped
from
the
wasted
little
hand.
Louis
picked
it
up,
and
reattached
it
to
the
chain.
An
uneasy
flush
coloured
his
brow.
Shirley
again
said,
"It
is
not
because
I
am
ill."
"Not
only
have
you
lost
sleep,
appetite,
and
flesh,"
proceeded
Moore,
"but
your
spirits
are
always
at
ebb.
Besides,
there
is
a
nervous
alarm
in
your
eye,
a
nervous
disquiet
in
your
manner.
These
peculiarities
were
not
formerly
yours."
"Mr.
Moore,
we
will
pause
here.
You
have
exactly
hit
it.
I
am
nervous.
Now,
talk
of
something
else.
What
wet
weather
we
have
steady,
pouring
rain!"
"You
nervous?
Yes;
and
if
Miss
Keeldar
is
nervous,
it
is
not
without
a
cause.
Let
me
reach
it.
Let
me
look
nearer.
The
ailment
is
not
physical.
I
have
suspected
that.
It
came
in
one
moment.
I
know
the
day.
I
noticed
the
change.
Your
pain
is
mental."
"Not
at
all.
It
is
nothing
so
dignified
merely
nervous.
Oh!
dismiss
the
topic."
"When
it
is
exhausted;
not
till
then.
Nervous
alarms
should
always
be
communicated,
that
they
may
be
dissipated.
I
wish
I
had
the
gift
of
persuasion,
and
could
incline
you
to
speak
willingly.
I
believe
confession,
in
your
case,
would
be
half
equivalent
to
cure."
"No,"
said
Shirley
abruptly.
"I
wish
that
were
at
all
probable;
but
I
am
afraid
it
is
not."
She
suspended
her
work
a
moment.
She
was
now
seated.
Resting
her
elbow
on
the
table,
she
leaned
her
head
on
her
hand.
Mr.
Moore
looked
as
if
he
felt
he
had
at
last
gained
some
footing
in
this
difficult
path.
She
was
serious,
and
in
her
wish
was
implied
an
important
admission;
after
that
she
could
no
longer
affirm
that
nothing
ailed
her.
The
tutor
allowed
her
some
minutes
for
repose
and
reflection
ere
he
returned
to
the
charge.
Once
his
lips
moved
to
speak,
but
he
thought
better
of
it,
and
prolonged
the
pause.
Shirley
lifted
her
eye
to
his.
Had
he
betrayed
injudicious
emotion,
perhaps
obstinate
persistence
in
silence
would
have
been
the
result;
but
he
looked
calm,
strong,
trustworthy.
"I
had
better
tell
you
than
my
aunt,"
she
said,
"or
than
my
cousins,
or
my
uncle.
They
would
all
make
such
a
bustle,
and
it
is
that
very
bustle
I
dread
the
alarm,
the
flurry,
the
eclat.
In
short,
I
never
liked
to
be
the
centre
of
a
small
domestic
whirlpool.
You
can
bear
a
little
shock
eh?"
"A
great
one,
if
necessary."
Not
a
muscle
of
the
man's
frame
moved,
and
yet
his
large
heart
beat
fast
in
his
deep
chest.
What
was
she
going
to
tell
him?
Was
irremediable
mischief
done?
"Had
I
thought
it
right
to
go
to
you,
I
would
never
have
made
a
secret
of
the
matter
one
moment,"
she
continued.
"I
would
have
told
you
at
once,
and
asked
advice."
"Why
was
it
not
right
to
come
to
me?"
"It
might
be
right
I
do
not
mean
that;
but
I
could
not
do
it.
I
seemed
to
have
no
title
to
trouble
you.
The
mishap
concerned
me
only.
I
wanted
to
keep
it
to
myself,
and
people
will
not
let
me.
I
tell
you,
I
hate
to
be
an
object
of
worrying
attention,
or
a
theme
for
village
gossip.
Besides,
it
may
pass
away
without
result
God
knows!"
Moore,
though
tortured
with
suspense,
did
not
demand
a
quick
explanation.
He
suffered
neither
gesture,
glance,
nor
word
to
betray
impatience.
His
tranquillity
tranquillized
Shirley;
his
confidence
reassured
her.
"Great
effects
may
spring
from
trivial
causes,"
she
remarked,
as
she
loosened
a
bracelet
from
her
wrist.
Then,
unfastening
her
sleeve,
and
partially
turning
it
up,
"Look
here,
Mr.
Moore."
She
showed
a
mark
in
her
white
arm
rather
a
deep
though
healed
up
indentation
something
between
a
burn
and
a
cut.
"I
would
