was
her
whim
to
wish
it;
but
what
means
to
employ
for
her
entertainment
he
knew
not.
He
hemmed
he
fidgeted.
"You'll
be
up
in
a
trice,"
he
observed,
by
way
of
saying
something.
"The
little
weakness
will
soon
pass
off;
and
then
you
must
drink
port
wine
a
pipe,
if
you
can
and
eat
game
and
oysters.
I'll
get
them
for
you,
if
they
are
to
be
had
anywhere.
Bless
me!
we'll
make
you
as
strong
as
Samson
before
we're
done
with
you."
"Who
is
that
lady,
uncle,
standing
beside
you
at
the
bed
foot?"
"Good
God!"
he
ejaculated.
"She's
not
wandering,
is
she,
ma'am?"
Mrs.
Pryor
smiled.
"I
am
wandering
in
a
pleasant
world,"
said
Caroline,
in
a
soft,
happy
voice,
"and
I
want
you
to
tell
me
whether
it
is
real
or
visionary.
What
lady
is
that?
Give
her
a
name,
uncle."
"We
must
have
Dr.
Rile
again,
ma'am;
or
better
still,
MacTurk.
He's
less
of
a
humbug.
Thomas
must
saddle
the
pony
and
go
for
him."
"No;
I
don't
want
a
doctor.
Mamma
shall
be
my
only
physician.
Now,
do
you
understand,
uncle?"
Mr.
Helstone
pushed
up
his
spectacles
from
his
nose
to
his
forehead,
handled
his
snuff
box,
and
administered
to
himself
a
portion
of
the
contents.
Thus
fortified,
he
answered
briefly,
"I
see
daylight.
You've
told
her
then,
ma'am?"
"And
is
it
true?"
demanded
Caroline,
rising
on
her
pillow.
"Is
she
really
my
mother?"
"You
won't
cry,
or
make
any
scene,
or
turn
hysterical,
if
I
answer
Yes?"
"Cry!
I'd
cry
if
you
said
No.
It
would
be
terrible
to
be
disappointed
now.
But
give
her
a
name.
How
do
you
call
her?"
"I
call
this
stout
lady
in
a
quaint
black
dress,
who
looks
young
enough
to
wear
much
smarter
raiment,
if
she
would
I
call
her
Agnes
Helstone.
She
married
my
brother
James,
and
is
his
widow."
"And
my
mother?"
"What
a
little
sceptic
it
is!
Look
at
her
small
face,
Mrs.
Pryor,
scarcely
larger
than
the
palm
of
my
hand,
alive
with
acuteness
and
eagerness."
To
Caroline
"She
had
the
trouble
of
bringing
you
into
the
world
at
any
rate.
Mind
you
show
your
duty
to
her
by
quickly
getting
well,
and
repairing
the
waste
of
these
cheeks.
Heigh
ho!
she
used
to
be
plump.
What
she
has
done
with
it
all
I
can't,
for
the
life
of
me,
divine."
"If
wishing
to
get
well
will
help
me,
I
shall
not
be
long
sick.
This
morning
I
had
no
reason
and
no
strength
to
wish
it."
Fanny
here
tapped
at
the
door,
and
said
that
supper
was
ready.
"Uncle,
if
you
please,
you
may
send
me
a
little
bit
of
supper
anything
you
like,
from
your
own
plate.
That
is
wiser
than
going
into
hysterics,
is
it
not?"
"It
is
spoken
like
a
sage,
Cary.
See
if
I
don't
cater
for
you
judiciously.
When
women
are
sensible,
and,
above
all,
intelligible,
I
can
get
on
with
them.
It
is
only
the
vague,
superfine
sensations,
and
extremely
wire
drawn
notions,
that
put
me
about.
Let
a
woman
ask
me
to
give
her
an
edible
or
a
wearable
be
the
same
a
roc's
egg
or
the
breastplate
of
Aaron,
a
share
of
St.
John's
locusts
and
honey
or
the
leathern
girdle
about
his
loins
I
can,
at
least,
understand
the
demand;
but
when
they
pine
for
they
know
not
what
sympathy,
sentiment,
some
of
these
indefinite
abstractions
I
can't
do
it;
I
don't
know
it;
I
haven't
got
it.
Madam,
accept
my
arm."
Mrs.
Pryor
signified
that
she
should
stay
with
her
daughter
that
evening.
Helstone,
accordingly,
left
them
together.
He
soon
returned,
bringing
a
plate
in
his
own
consecrated
hand.
"This
is
chicken,"
he
said,
"but
we'll
have
partridge
to
morrow.
Lift
her
up,
and
put
a
shawl
over
her.
On
my
word,
I
understand
nursing.
Now,
here
is
the
very
same
little
silver
fork
you
used
when
you
first
came
to
the
rectory.
That
strikes
me
as
being
what
you
may
call
a
happy
thought
a
delicate
attention.
Take
it,
Cary,
and
munch
away
cleverly."
Caroline
did
her
best.
Her
uncle
frowned
to
see
that
her
powers
were
so
limited.
He
prophesied,
however,
great
things
for
the
future;
and
as
she
praised
the
morsel
he
had
brought,
and
smiled
gratefully
in
his
face,
he
stooped
over
her
pillow,
kissed
her,
and
said,
with
a
broken,
rugged
accent,
"Good
night,
bairnie!
God
bless
thee!"
Caroline
enjoyed
such
peaceful
rest
that
night,
circled
by
her
mother's
arms,
and
pillowed
on
her
breast,
that
she
forgot
to
wish
for
any
other
stay;
and
though
more
than
one
feverish
dream
came
to
her
in
slumber,
yet,
when
she
woke
up
panting,
so
happy
and
contented
a
feeling
returned
with
returning
consciousness
that
her
agitation
was
soothed
almost
as
soon
as
felt.
As
to
the
mother,
she
spent
the
night
like
Jacob
at
Peniel.
Till
break
of
day
she
wrestled
with
God
in
earnest
prayer.
Not
always
do
those
who
dare
such
divine
conflict
prevail.
Night
after
night
the
sweat
of
agony
may
burst
dark
on
the
forehead;
the
supplicant
may
cry
for
mercy
with
that
soundless
voice
the
soul
utters
when
its
appeal
is
to
the
Invisible.
"Spare
my
beloved,"
it
may
implore.
"Heal
my
life's
life.
Rend
not
from
me
what
long
affection
entwines
with
my
whole
nature.
God
of
heaven,
bend,
hear,
be
clement!"
And
after
this
cry
and
strife
the
sun
may
rise
and
see
him
worsted.
That
opening
morn,
which
used
to
salute
him
with
the
whisper
of
zephyrs,
the
carol
of
skylarks,
may
breathe,
as
its
first
accents,
from
the
dear
lips
which
colour
and
heat
have
quitted,
"Oh!
I
have
had
a
suffering
night.
This
morning
I
am
worse.
I
have
tried
to
rise.
I
cannot.
Dreams
I
am
unused
to
have
troubled
me."
Then
the
watcher
approaches
the
patient's
pillow,
and
sees
a
new
and
strange
moulding
of
the
familiar
features,
feels
at
once
that
the
insufferable
moment
