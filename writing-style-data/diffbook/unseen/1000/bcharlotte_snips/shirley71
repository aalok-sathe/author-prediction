slow
to
make
fresh
acquaintance.
She
was
always
held
back
by
the
idea
that
people
could
not
want
her,
that
she
could
not
amuse
them;
and
a
brilliant,
happy,
youthful
creature
like
the
heiress
of
Fieldhead
seemed
to
her
too
completely
independent
of
society
so
uninteresting
as
hers
ever
to
find
it
really
welcome.
Shirley
might
be
brilliant,
and
probably
happy
likewise,
but
no
one
is
independent
of
genial
society;
and
though
in
about
a
month
she
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
most
of
the
families
round,
and
was
on
quite
free
and
easy
terms
with
all
the
Misses
Sykes,
and
all
the
Misses
Pearson,
and
the
two
superlative
Misses
Wynne
of
Walden
Hall,
yet,
it
appeared,
she
found
none
amongst
them
very
genial:
she
fraternized
with
none
of
them,
to
use
her
own
words.
If
she
had
had
the
bliss
to
be
really
Shirley
Keeldar,
Esq.,
lord
of
the
manor
of
Briarfield,
there
was
not
a
single
fair
one
in
this
and
the
two
neighbouring
parishes
whom
she
should
have
felt
disposed
to
request
to
become
Mrs.
Keeldar,
lady
of
the
manor.
This
declaration
she
made
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
received
it
very
quietly,
as
she
did
most
of
her
pupil's
off
hand
speeches,
responding,
"My
dear,
do
not
allow
that
habit
of
alluding
to
yourself
as
a
gentleman
to
be
confirmed.
It
is
a
strange
one.
Those
who
do
not
know
you,
hearing
you
speak
thus,
would
think
you
affected
masculine
manners."
Shirley
never
laughed
at
her
former
governess;
even
the
little
formalities
and
harmless
peculiarities
of
that
lady
were
respectable
in
her
eyes.
Had
it
been
otherwise,
she
would
have
proved
herself
a
weak
character
at
once;
for
it
is
only
the
weak
who
make
a
butt
of
quiet
worth.
Therefore
she
took
her
remonstrance
in
silence.
She
stood
quietly
near
the
window,
looking
at
the
grand
cedar
on
her
lawn
watching
a
bird
on
one
of
its
lower
boughs.
Presently
she
began
to
chirrup
to
the
bird;
soon
her
chirrup
grew
clearer;
ere
long
she
was
whistling;
the
whistle
struck
into
a
tune,
and
very
sweetly
and
deftly
it
was
executed.
"My
dear!"
expostulated
Mrs.
Pryor.
"Was
I
whistling?"
said
Shirley.
"I
forgot.
I
beg
your
pardon,
ma'am.
I
had
resolved
to
take
care
not
to
whistle
before
you."
"But,
Miss
Keeldar,
where
did
you
learn
to
whistle?
You
must
have
got
the
habit
since
you
came
down
into
Yorkshire.
I
never
knew
you
guilty
of
it
before."
"Oh!
I
learned
to
whistle
a
long
while
ago."
"Who
taught
you?"
"No
one.
I
took
it
up
by
listening,
and
I
had
laid
it
down
again.
But
lately,
yesterday
evening,
as
I
was
coming
up
our
lane,
I
heard
a
gentleman
whistling
that
very
tune
in
the
field
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge,
and
that
reminded
me."
"What
gentleman
was
it?"
"We
have
only
one
gentleman
in
this
region,
ma'am,
and
that
is
Mr.
Moore
at
least
he
is
the
only
gentleman
who
is
not
gray
haired.
My
two
venerable
favourites,
Mr.
Helstone
and
Mr.
Yorke,
it
is
true,
are
fine
old
beaus,
infinitely
better
than
any
of
the
stupid
young
ones."
Mrs.
Pryor
was
silent.
"You
do
not
like
Mr.
Helstone,
ma'am?"
"My
dear,
Mr.
Helstone's
office
secures
him
from
criticism."
"You
generally
contrive
to
leave
the
room
when
he
is
announced."
"Do
you
walk
out
this
morning,
my
dear?"
"Yes,
I
shall
go
to
the
rectory,
and
seek
and
find
Caroline
Helstone,
and
make
her
take
some
exercise.
She
shall
have
a
breezy
walk
over
Nunnely
Common."
"If
you
go
in
that
direction,
my
dear,
have
the
goodness
to
remind
Miss
Helstone
to
wrap
up
well,
as
there
is
a
fresh
wind,
and
she
appears
to
me
to
require
care."
"You
shall
be
minutely
obeyed,
Mrs.
Pryor.
Meantime,
will
you
not
accompany
us
yourself?"
"No,
my
love;
I
should
be
a
restraint
upon
you.
I
am
stout,
and
cannot
walk
so
quickly
as
you
would
wish
to
do."
Shirley
easily
persuaded
Caroline
to
go
with
her,
and
when
they
were
fairly
out
on
the
quiet
road,
traversing
the
extensive
and
solitary
sweep
of
Nunnely
Common,
she
as
easily
drew
her
into
conversation.
The
first
feelings
of
diffidence
overcome,
Caroline
soon
felt
glad
to
talk
with
Miss
Keeldar.
The
very
first
interchange
of
slight
observations
sufficed
to
give
each
an
idea
of
what
the
other
was.
Shirley
said
she
liked
the
green
sweep
of
the
common
turf,
and,
better
still,
the
heath
on
its
ridges,
for
the
heath
reminded
her
of
moors.
She
had
seen
moors
when
she
was
travelling
on
the
borders
near
Scotland.
She
remembered
particularly
a
district
traversed
one
long
afternoon,
on
a
sultry
but
sunless
day
in
summer.
They
journeyed
from
noon
till
sunset,
over
what
seemed
a
boundless
waste
of
deep
heath,
and
nothing
had
they
seen
but
wild
sheep,
nothing
heard
but
the
cries
of
wild
birds.
"I
know
how
the
heath
would
look
on
such
a
day,"
said
Caroline;
"purple
black
a
deeper
shade
of
the
sky
tint,
and
that
would
be
livid."
"Yes,
quite
livid,
with
brassy
edges
to
the
clouds,
and
here
and
there
a
white
gleam,
more
ghastly
than
the
lurid
tinge,
which,
as
you
looked
at
it,
you
momentarily
expected
would
kindle
into
blinding
lightning."
"Did
it
thunder?"
"It
muttered
distant
peals,
but
the
storm
did
not
break
till
evening,
after
we
had
reached
our
inn
that
inn
being
an
isolated
house
at
the
foot
of
a
range
of
mountains."
"Did
you
watch
the
clouds
come
down
over
the
mountains?"
"I
did.
I
stood
at
the
window
an
hour
watching
them.
The
hills
seemed
rolled
in
a
sullen
mist,
and
when
the
rain
fell
in
whitening
sheets,
suddenly
they
were
blotted
from
the
prospect;
they
were
washed
from
the
world."
"I
have
seen
such
storms
in
hilly
districts
in
Yorkshire;
and
at
their
riotous
climax,
while
the
sky
was
all
cataract,
the
earth
all
flood,
I
have
remembered
the
Deluge."
"It
is
singularly
