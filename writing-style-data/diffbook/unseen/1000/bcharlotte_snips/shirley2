of
Nunnely
came
to
tea,
remained
to
supper,
occupied
the
spare
bed,
and
favoured
her
with
their
company
to
breakfast
on
Wednesday
morning;
now,
on
Thursday,
they
are
both
here
at
dinner,
and
she
is
almost
certain
they
will
stay
all
night.
"C'en
est
trop,"
she
would
say,
if
she
could
speak
French.
Mr.
Sweeting
is
mincing
the
slice
of
roast
beef
on
his
plate,
and
complaining
that
it
is
very
tough;
Mr.
Donne
says
the
beer
is
flat.
Ay,
that
is
the
worst
of
it:
if
they
would
only
be
civil
Mrs.
Gale
wouldn't
mind
it
so
much,
if
they
would
only
seem
satisfied
with
what
they
get
she
wouldn't
care;
but
"these
young
parsons
is
so
high
and
so
scornful,
they
set
everybody
beneath
their
'fit.'
They
treat
her
with
less
than
civility,
just
because
she
doesn't
keep
a
servant,
but
does
the
work
of
the
house
herself,
as
her
mother
did
afore
her;
then
they
are
always
speaking
against
Yorkshire
ways
and
Yorkshire
folk,"
and
by
that
very
token
Mrs.
Gale
does
not
believe
one
of
them
to
be
a
real
gentleman,
or
come
of
gentle
kin.
"The
old
parsons
is
worth
the
whole
lump
of
college
lads;
they
know
what
belongs
to
good
manners,
and
is
kind
to
high
and
low."
"More
bread!"
cries
Mr.
Malone,
in
a
tone
which,
though
prolonged
but
to
utter
two
syllables,
proclaims
him
at
once
a
native
of
the
land
of
shamrocks
and
potatoes.
Mrs.
Gale
hates
Mr.
Malone
more
than
either
of
the
other
two;
but
she
fears
him
also,
for
he
is
a
tall,
strongly
built
personage,
with
real
Irish
legs
and
arms,
and
a
face
as
genuinely
national
not
the
Milesian
face,
not
Daniel
O'Connell's
style,
but
the
high
featured,
North
American
Indian
sort
of
visage,
which
belongs
to
a
certain
class
of
the
Irish
gentry,
and
has
a
petrified
and
proud
look,
better
suited
to
the
owner
of
an
estate
of
slaves
than
to
the
landlord
of
a
free
peasantry.
Mr.
Malone's
father
termed
himself
a
gentleman:
he
was
poor
and
in
debt,
and
besottedly
arrogant;
and
his
son
was
like
him.
Mrs.
Gale
offered
the
loaf.
"Cut
it,
woman,"
said
her
guest;
and
the
"woman"
cut
it
accordingly.
Had
she
followed
her
inclinations,
she
would
have
cut
the
parson
also;
her
Yorkshire
soul
revolted
absolutely
from
his
manner
of
command.
The
curates
had
good
appetites,
and
though
the
beef
was
"tough,"
they
ate
a
great
deal
of
it.
They
swallowed,
too,
a
tolerable
allowance
of
the
"flat
beer,"
while
a
dish
of
Yorkshire
pudding,
and
two
tureens
of
vegetables,
disappeared
like
leaves
before
locusts.
The
cheese,
too,
received
distinguished
marks
of
their
attention;
and
a
"spice
cake,"
which
followed
by
way
of
dessert,
vanished
like
a
vision,
and
was
no
more
found.
Its
elegy
was
chanted
in
the
kitchen
by
Abraham,
Mrs.
Gale's
son
and
heir,
a
youth
of
six
summers;
he
had
reckoned
upon
the
reversion
thereof,
and
when
his
mother
brought
down
the
empty
platter,
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
wept
sore.
The
curates,
meantime,
sat
and
sipped
their
wine,
a
liquor
of
unpretending
vintage,
moderately
enjoyed.
Mr.
Malone,
indeed,
would
much
rather
have
had
whisky;
but
Mr.
Donne,
being
an
Englishman,
did
not
keep
the
beverage.
While
they
sipped
they
argued,
not
on
politics,
nor
on
philosophy,
nor
on
literature
these
topics
were
now,
as
ever,
totally
without
interest
for
them
not
even
on
theology,
practical
or
doctrinal,
but
on
minute
points
of
ecclesiastical
discipline,
frivolities
which
seemed
empty
as
bubbles
to
all
save
themselves.
Mr.
Malone,
who
contrived
to
secure
two
glasses
of
wine,
when
his
brethren
contented
themselves
with
one,
waxed
by
degrees
hilarious
after
his
fashion;
that
is,
he
grew
a
little
insolent,
said
rude
things
in
a
hectoring
tone,
and
laughed
clamorously
at
his
own
brilliancy.
Each
of
his
companions
became
in
turn
his
butt.
Malone
had
a
stock
of
jokes
at
their
service,
which
he
was
accustomed
to
serve
out
regularly
on
convivial
occasions
like
the
present,
seldom
varying
his
wit;
for
which,
indeed,
there
was
no
necessity,
as
he
never
appeared
to
consider
himself
monotonous,
and
did
not
at
all
care
what
others
thought.
Mr.
Donne
he
favoured
with
hints
about
his
extreme
meagreness,
allusions
to
his
turned
up
nose,
cutting
sarcasms
on
a
certain
threadbare
chocolate
surtout
which
that
gentleman
was
accustomed
to
sport
whenever
it
rained
or
seemed
likely
to
rain,
and
criticisms
on
a
choice
set
of
cockney
phrases
and
modes
of
pronunciation,
Mr.
Donne's
own
property,
and
certainly
deserving
of
remark
for
the
elegance
and
finish
they
communicated
to
his
style.
Mr.
Sweeting
was
bantered
about
his
stature
he
was
a
little
man,
a
mere
boy
in
height
and
breadth
compared
with
the
athletic
Malone;
rallied
on
his
musical
accomplishments
he
played
the
flute
and
sang
hymns
like
a
seraph,
some
young
ladies
of
his
parish
thought;
sneered
at
as
"the
ladies'
pet;"
teased
about
his
mamma
and
sisters,
for
whom
poor
Mr.
Sweeting
had
some
lingering
regard,
and
of
whom
he
was
foolish
enough
now
and
then
to
speak
in
the
presence
of
the
priestly
Paddy,
from
whose
anatomy
the
bowels
of
natural
affection
had
somehow
been
omitted.
The
victims
met
these
attacks
each
in
his
own
way:
Mr.
Donne
with
a
stilted
self
complacency
and
half
sullen
phlegm,
the
sole
props
of
his
otherwise
somewhat
rickety
dignity;
Mr.
Sweeting
with
the
indifference
of
a
light,
easy
disposition,
which
never
professed
to
have
any
dignity
to
maintain.
When
Malone's
raillery
became
rather
too
offensive,
which
it
soon
did,
they
joined,
in
an
attempt
to
turn
the
tables
on
him
by
asking
him
how
many
boys
had
shouted
"Irish
Peter!"
after
him
as
he
came
along
the
road
that
day
(Malone's
name
was
Peter
the
Rev.
Peter
Augustus
Malone);
requesting
to
be
informed
whether
it
was
the
mode
in
Ireland
for
clergymen
to
carry
loaded
pistols
in
their
pockets,
and
a
shillelah
in
their
hands,
when
they
made
pastoral
visits;
inquiring
