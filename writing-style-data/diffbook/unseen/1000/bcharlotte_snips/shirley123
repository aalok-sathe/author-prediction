this
house
contains
is
at
Mr.
Moore's,
Mr.
Helstone's,
and
the
soldiers'
service.
Do
that
first."
While
the
order
was
being
executed,
Shirley
moved
away
from
her
friends,
and
stood
at
the
hall
window,
silent,
unapproachable.
When
Mrs.
Gill
came
back,
she
turned.
The
purple
flush
which
painful
excitement
kindles
on
a
pale
cheek
glowed
on
hers;
the
spark
which
displeasure
lights
in
a
dark
eye
fired
her
glance.
"Let
the
contents
of
the
larder
and
the
wine
cellar
be
brought
up,
put
into
the
hay
carts,
and
driven
down
to
the
Hollow.
If
there
does
not
happen
to
be
much
bread
or
much
meat
in
the
house,
go
to
the
butcher
and
baker,
and
desire
them
to
send
what
they
have.
But
I
will
see
for
myself."
She
moved
off.
"All
will
be
right
soon;
she
will
get
over
it
in
an
hour,"
whispered
Caroline
to
Mrs.
Pryor.
"Go
upstairs,
dear
madam,"
she
added
affectionately,
"and
try
to
be
as
calm
and
easy
as
you
can.
The
truth
is,
Shirley
will
blame
herself
more
than
you
before
the
day
is
over."
By
dint
of
a
few
more
gentle
assurances
and
persuasions,
Miss
Helstone
contrived
to
soothe
the
agitated
lady.
Having
accompanied
her
to
her
apartment,
and
promised
to
rejoin
her
there
when
things
were
settled,
Caroline
left
her
to
see,
as
she
said,
"if
she
could
be
useful."
She
presently
found
that
she
could
be
very
useful;
for
the
retinue
of
servants
at
Fieldhead
was
by
no
means
numerous,
and
just
now
their
mistress
found
plenty
of
occupation
for
all
the
hands
at
her
command,
and
for
her
own
also.
The
delicate
good
nature
and
dexterous
activity
which
Caroline
brought
to
the
aid
of
the
housekeeper
and
maids
all
somewhat
scared
by
their
lady's
unwonted
mood
did
a
world
of
good
at
once;
it
helped
the
assistants
and
appeased
the
directress.
A
chance
glance
and
smile
from
Caroline
moved
Shirley
to
an
answering
smile
directly.
The
former
was
carrying
a
heavy
basket
up
the
cellar
stairs.
"This
is
a
shame!"
cried
Shirley,
running
to
her.
"It
will
strain
your
arm."
She
took
it
from
her,
and
herself
bore
it
out
into
the
yard.
The
cloud
of
temper
was
dispelled
when
she
came
back;
the
flash
in
her
eye
was
melted;
the
shade
on
her
forehead
vanished.
She
resumed
her
usual
cheerful
and
cordial
manner
to
those
about
her,
tempering
her
revived
spirits
with
a
little
of
the
softness
of
shame
at
her
previous
unjust
anger.
She
was
still
superintending
the
lading
of
the
cart,
when
a
gentleman
entered
the
yard
and
approached
her
ere
she
was
aware
of
his
presence.
"I
hope
I
see
Miss
Keeldar
well
this
morning?"
he
said,
examining
with
rather
significant
scrutiny
her
still
flushed
face.
She
gave
him
a
look,
and
then
again
bent
to
her
employment
without
reply.
A
pleasant
enough
smile
played
on
her
lips,
but
she
hid
it.
The
gentleman
repeated
his
salutation,
stooping,
that
it
might
reach
her
ear
with
more
facility.
"Well
enough,
if
she
be
good
enough,"
was
the
answer;
"and
so
is
Mr.
Moore
too,
I
dare
say.
To
speak
truth,
I
am
not
anxious
about
him;
some
slight
mischance
would
be
only
his
just
due.
His
conduct
has
been
we
will
say
strange
just
now,
till
we
have
time
to
characterize
it
by
a
more
exact
epithet.
Meantime,
may
I
ask
what
brings
him
here?"
"Mr.
Helstone
and
I
have
just
received
your
message
that
everything
at
Fieldhead
was
at
our
service.
We
judged,
by
the
unlimited
wording
of
the
gracious
intimation,
that
you
would
be
giving
yourself
too
much
trouble.
I
perceive
our
conjecture
was
correct.
We
are
not
a
regiment,
remember
only
about
half
a
dozen
soldiers
and
as
many
civilians.
Allow
me
to
retrench
something
from
these
too
abundant
supplies."
Miss
Keeldar
blushed,
while
she
laughed
at
her
own
over
eager
generosity
and
most
disproportionate
calculations.
Moore
laughed
too,
very
quietly
though;
and
as
quietly
he
ordered
basket
after
basket
to
be
taken
from
the
cart,
and
remanded
vessel
after
vessel
to
the
cellar.
"The
rector
must
hear
of
this,"
he
said;
"he
will
make
a
good
story
of
it.
What
an
excellent
army
contractor
Miss
Keeldar
would
have
been!"
Again
he
laughed,
adding,
"It
is
precisely
as
I
conjectured."
"You
ought
to
be
thankful,"
said
Shirley,
"and
not
mock
me.
What
could
I
do?
How
could
I
gauge
your
appetites
or
number
your
band?
For
aught
I
knew,
there
might
have
been
fifty
of
you
at
least
to
victual.
You
told
me
nothing;
and
then
an
application
to
provision
soldiers
naturally
suggests
large
ideas."
"It
appears
so,"
remarked
Moore,
levelling
another
of
his
keen,
quiet
glances
at
the
discomfited
Shirley.
"Now,"
he
continued,
addressing
the
carter,
"I
think
you
may
take
what
remains
to
the
Hollow.
Your
load
will
be
somewhat
lighter
than
the
one
Miss
Keeldar
destined
you
to
carry."
As
the
vehicle
rumbled
out
of
the
yard,
Shirley,
rallying
her
spirits,
demanded
what
had
become
of
the
wounded.
"There
was
not
a
single
man
hurt
on
our
side,"
was
the
answer.
"You
were
hurt
yourself,
on
the
temples,"
interposed
a
quick,
low
voice
that
of
Caroline,
who,
having
withdrawn
within
the
shade
of
the
door,
and
behind
the
large
person
of
Mrs.
Gill,
had
till
now
escaped
Moore's
notice.
When
she
spoke,
his
eye
searched
the
obscurity
of
her
retreat.
"Are
you
much
hurt?"
she
inquired.
"As
you
might
scratch
your
finger
with
a
needle
in
sewing."
"Lift
your
hair
and
let
us
see."
He
took
his
hat
off,
and
did
as
he
was
bid,
disclosing
only
a
narrow
slip
of
court
plaster.
Caroline
indicated,
by
a
slight
movement
of
the
head,
that
she
was
satisfied,
and
disappeared
within
the
clear
obscure
of
the
interior.
"How
did
she
know
I
was
hurt?"
asked
Moore.
"By
rumour,
no
doubt.
But
it
is
too
good
in
her
to
trouble
herself
about
you.
For
my
part,
it
was
of
your
victims
I
was
