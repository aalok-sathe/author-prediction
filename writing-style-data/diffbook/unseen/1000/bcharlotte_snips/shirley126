by
him,
because
they
venture
to
espouse
the
cause
of
one
against
two
hundred?"
"Come,
come
now,
be
cool,"
said
Mr.
Yorke,
smiling
at
the
earnestness
with
which
Shirley
multiplied
her
rapid
questions.
"Cool!
Must
I
listen
coolly
to
downright
nonsense
to
dangerous
nonsense?
No.
I
like
you
very
well,
Mr.
Yorke,
as
you
know,
but
I
thoroughly
dislike
some
of
your
principles.
All
that
cant
excuse
me,
but
I
repeat
the
word
all
that
cant
about
soldiers
and
parsons
is
most
offensive
in
my
ears.
All
ridiculous,
irrational
crying
up
of
one
class,
whether
the
same
be
aristocrat
or
democrat
all
howling
down
of
another
class,
whether
clerical
or
military
all
exacting
injustice
to
individuals,
whether
monarch
or
mendicant
is
really
sickening
to
me;
all
arraying
of
ranks
against
ranks,
all
party
hatreds,
all
tyrannies
disguised
as
liberties,
I
reject
and
wash
my
hands
of.
You
think
you
are
a
philanthropist;
you
think
you
are
an
advocate
of
liberty;
but
I
will
tell
you
this
Mr.
Hall,
the
parson
of
Nunnely,
is
a
better
friend
both
of
man
and
freedom
than
Hiram
Yorke,
the
reformer
of
Briarfield."
From
a
man
Mr.
Yorke
would
not
have
borne
this
language
very
patiently,
nor
would
he
have
endured
it
from
some
women;
but
he
accounted
Shirley
both
honest
and
pretty,
and
her
plain
spoken
ire
amused
him.
Besides,
he
took
a
secret
pleasure
in
hearing
her
defend
her
tenant,
for
we
have
already
intimated
he
had
Robert
Moore's
interest
very
much
at
heart.
Moreover,
if
he
wished
to
avenge
himself
for
her
severity,
he
knew
the
means
lay
in
his
power:
a
word,
he
believed,
would
suffice
to
tame
and
silence
her,
to
cover
her
frank
forehead
with
the
rosy
shadow
of
shame,
and
veil
the
glow
of
her
eye
under
down
drooped
lid
and
lash.
"What
more
hast
thou
to
say?"
he
inquired,
as
she
paused,
rather,
it
appeared,
to
take
breath
than
because
her
subject
or
her
zeal
was
exhausted.
"Say,
Mr.
Yorke!"
was
the
answer,
the
speaker
meantime
walking
fast
from
wall
to
wall
of
the
oak
parlour
"say?
I
have
a
great
deal
to
say,
if
I
could
get
it
out
in
lucid
order,
which
I
never
can
do.
I
have
to
say
that
your
views,
and
those
of
most
extreme
politicians,
are
such
as
none
but
men
in
an
irresponsible
position
can
advocate;
that
they
are
purely
opposition
views,
meant
only
to
be
talked
about,
and
never
intended
to
be
acted
on.
Make
you
Prime
Minister
of
England
to
morrow,
and
you
would
have
to
abandon
them.
You
abuse
Moore
for
defending
his
mill.
Had
you
been
in
Moore's
place
you
could
not
with
honour
or
sense
have
acted
otherwise
than
he
acted.
You
abuse
Mr.
Helstone
for
everything
he
does.
Mr.
Helstone
has
his
faults;
he
sometimes
does
wrong,
but
oftener
right.
Were
you
ordained
vicar
of
Briarfield,
you
would
find
it
no
easy
task
to
sustain
all
the
active
schemes
for
the
benefit
of
the
parish
planned
and
persevered
in
by
your
predecessor.
I
wonder
people
cannot
judge
more
fairly
of
each
other
and
themselves.
When
I
hear
Messrs.
Malone
and
Donne
chatter
about
the
authority
of
the
church,
the
dignity
and
claims
of
the
priesthood,
the
deference
due
to
them
as
clergymen;
when
I
hear
the
outbreaks
of
their
small
spite
against
Dissenters;
when
I
witness
their
silly,
narrow
jealousies
and
assumptions;
when
their
palaver
about
forms,
and
traditions,
and
superstitions
is
sounding
in
my
ear;
when
I
behold
their
insolent
carriage
to
the
poor,
their
often
base
servility
to
the
rich
I
think
the
Establishment
is
indeed
in
a
poor
way,
and
both
she
and
her
sons
appear
in
the
utmost
need
of
reformation.
Turning
away
distressed
from
minster
tower
and
village
spire
ay,
as
distressed
as
a
churchwarden
who
feels
the
exigence
of
white
wash
and
has
not
wherewithal
to
purchase
lime
I
recall
your
senseless
sarcasms
on
the
'fat
bishops,'
the
'pampered
parsons,'
'old
mother
church,'
etc.
I
remember
your
strictures
on
all
who
differ
from
you,
your
sweeping
condemnation
of
classes
and
individuals,
without
the
slightest
allowance
made
for
circumstances
or
temptations;
and
then,
Mr.
Yorke,
doubt
clutches
my
inmost
heart
as
to
whether
men
exist
clement,
reasonable,
and
just
enough
to
be
entrusted
with
the
task
of
reform.
I
don't
believe
you
are
of
the
number."
"You
have
an
ill
opinion
of
me,
Miss
Shirley.
You
never
told
me
so
much
of
your
mind
before."
"I
never
had
an
opening.
But
I
have
sat
on
Jessy's
stool
by
your
chair
in
the
back
parlour
at
Briarmains,
for
evenings
together,
listening
excitedly
to
your
talk,
half
admiring
what
you
said,
and
half
rebelling
against
it.
I
think
you
a
fine
old
Yorkshireman,
sir.
I
am
proud
to
have
been
born
in
the
same
county
and
parish
as
yourself.
Truthful,
upright,
independent
you
are,
as
a
rock
based
below
seas;
but
also
you
are
harsh,
rude,
narrow,
and
merciless."
"Not
to
the
poor,
lass,
nor
to
the
meek
of
the
earth;
only
to
the
proud
and
high
minded."
"And
what
right
have
you,
sir,
to
make
such
distinctions?
A
prouder,
a
higher
minded
man
than
yourself
does
not
exist.
You
find
it
easy
to
speak
comfortably
to
your
inferiors;
you
are
too
haughty,
too
ambitious,
too
jealous
to
be
civil
to
those
above
you.
But
you
are
all
alike.
Helstone
also
is
proud
and
prejudiced.
Moore,
though
juster
and
more
considerate
than
either
you
or
the
rector,
is
still
haughty,
stern,
and,
in
a
public
sense,
selfish.
It
is
well
there
are
such
men
as
Mr.
Hall
to
be
found
occasionally
men
of
large
and
kind
hearts,
who
can
love
their
whole
race,
who
can
forgive
others
for
being
richer,
more
prosperous,
or
more
powerful
than
they
are.
Such
men
may
have
less
originality,
less
force
of
character
than
you,
but
they
are
better
friends
to
mankind."
"And
when
is
it
to
be?"
said
Mr.
Yorke,
now
rising.
"When
is
what
