blue
of
heaven
above,
pours
a
wondrous
descent,
dread
as
the
downrushing
of
stars.
He
has
what
he
asked.
Withdraw
forbear
to
look
I
am
blinded.
I
hear
in
that
fane
an
unspeakable
sound.
Would
that
I
could
not
hear
it!
I
see
an
insufferable
glory
burning
terribly
between
the
pillars.
Gods
be
merciful
and
quench
it!
"A
pious
Argive
enters
to
make
an
early
offering
in
the
cool
dawn
of
morning.
There
was
thunder
in
the
night;
the
bolt
fell
here.
The
shrine
is
shivered,
the
marble
pavement
round
split
and
blackened.
Saturnia's
statue
rises
chaste,
grand,
untouched;
at
her
feet
piled
ashes
lie
pale.
No
priest
remains;
he
who
watched
will
be
seen
no
more.
"There
is
the
carriage!
Let
me
lock
up
the
desk
and
pocket
the
keys.
She
will
be
seeking
them
to
morrow;
she
will
have
to
come
to
me.
I
hear
her:
'Mr.
Moore,
have
you
seen
my
keys?'
"So
she
will
say,
in
her
clear
voice,
speaking
with
reluctance,
looking
ashamed,
conscious
that
this
is
the
twentieth
time
of
asking.
I
will
tantalize
her,
keep
her
with
me,
expecting,
doubting;
and
when
I
do
restore
them,
it
shall
not
be
without
a
lecture.
Here
is
the
bag,
too,
and
the
purse;
the
glove
pen
seal.
She
shall
wring
them
all
out
of
me
slowly
and
separately
only
by
confession,
penitence,
entreaty.
I
never
can
touch
her
hand,
or
a
ringlet
of
her
head,
or
a
ribbon
of
her
dress,
but
I
will
make
privileges
for
myself.
Every
feature
of
her
face,
her
bright
eyes,
her
lips,
shall
go
through
each
change
they
know,
for
my
pleasure
display
each
exquisite
variety
of
glance
and
curve,
to
delight,
thrill,
perhaps
more
hopelessly
to
enchain
me.
If
I
must
be
her
slave,
I
will
not
lose
my
freedom
for
nothing."
He
locked
the
desk,
pocketed
all
the
property,
and
went.
Everybody
said
it
was
high
time
for
Mr.
Moore
to
return
home.
All
Briarfield
wondered
at
his
strange
absence,
and
Whinbury
and
Nunnely
brought
each
its
separate
contribution
of
amazement.
Was
it
known
why
he
stayed
away?
Yes.
It
was
known
twenty
forty
times
over,
there
being
at
least
forty
plausible
reasons
adduced
to
account
for
the
unaccountable
circumstance.
Business
it
was
not
that
the
gossips
agreed.
He
had
achieved
the
business
on
which
he
departed
long
ago.
His
four
ringleaders
he
had
soon
scented
out
and
run
down.
He
had
attended
their
trial,
heard
their
conviction
and
sentence,
and
seen
them
safely
shipped
prior
to
transportation.
This
was
known
at
Briarfield.
The
newspapers
had
reported
it.
The
Stilbro'
Courier
had
given
every
particular,
with
amplifications.
None
applauded
his
perseverance
or
hailed
his
success,
though
the
mill
owners
were
glad
of
it,
trusting
that
the
terrors
of
law
vindicated
would
henceforward
paralyze
the
sinister
valour
of
disaffection.
Disaffection,
however,
was
still
heard
muttering
to
himself.
He
swore
ominous
oaths
over
the
drugged
beer
of
alehouses,
and
drank
strange
toasts
in
fiery
British
gin.
One
report
affirmed
that
Moore
dared
not
come
to
Yorkshire;
he
knew
his
life
was
not
worth
an
hour's
purchase
if
he
did.
"I'll
tell
him
that,"
said
Mr.
Yorke,
when
his
foreman
mentioned
the
rumour;
"and
if
that
does
not
bring
him
home
full
gallop,
nothing
will."
Either
that
or
some
other
motive
prevailed
at
last
to
recall
him.
He
announced
to
Joe
Scott
the
day
he
should
arrive
at
Stilbro',
desiring
his
hackney
to
be
sent
to
the
George
for
his
accommodation;
and
Joe
Scott
having
informed
Mr.
Yorke,
that
gentleman
made
it
in
his
way
to
meet
him.
It
was
market
day.
Moore
arrived
in
time
to
take
his
usual
place
at
the
market
dinner.
As
something
of
a
stranger,
and
as
a
man
of
note
and
action,
the
assembled
manufacturers
received
him
with
a
certain
distinction.
Some,
who
in
public
would
scarcely
have
dared
to
acknowledge
his
acquaintance,
lest
a
little
of
the
hate
and
vengeance
laid
up
in
store
for
him
should
perchance
have
fallen
on
them,
in
private
hailed
him
as
in
some
sort
their
champion.
When
the
wine
had
circulated,
their
respect
would
have
kindled
to
enthusiasm
had
not
Moore's
unshaken
nonchalance
held
it
in
a
damp,
low,
smouldering
state.
Mr.
Yorke,
the
permanent
president
of
these
dinners,
witnessed
his
young
friend's
bearing
with
exceeding
complacency.
If
one
thing
could
stir
his
temper
or
excite
his
contempt
more
than
another,
it
was
to
see
a
man
befooled
by
flattery
or
elate
with
popularity.
If
one
thing
smoothed,
soothed,
and
charmed
him
especially,
it
was
the
spectacle
of
a
public
character
incapable
of
relishing
his
publicity
incapable,
I
say.
Disdain
would
but
have
incensed;
it
was
indifference
that
appeased
his
rough
spirit.
Robert,
leaning
back
in
his
chair,
quiet
and
almost
surly,
while
the
clothiers
and
blanket
makers
vaunted
his
prowess
and
rehearsed
his
deeds
many
of
them
interspersing
their
flatteries
with
coarse
invectives
against
the
operative
class
was
a
delectable
sight
for
Mr.
Yorke.
His
heart
tingled
with
the
pleasing
conviction
that
these
gross
eulogiums
shamed
Moore
deeply,
and
made
him
half
scorn
himself
and
his
work.
On
abuse,
on
reproach,
on
calumny,
it
is
easy
to
smile;
but
painful
indeed
is
the
panegyric
of
those
we
contemn.
Often
had
Moore
gazed
with
a
brilliant
countenance
over
howling
crowds
from
a
hostile
hustings.
He
had
breasted
the
storm
of
unpopularity
with
gallant
bearing
and
soul
elate;
but
he
drooped
his
head
under
the
half
bred
tradesmen's
praise,
and
shrank
chagrined
before
their
congratulations.
Yorke
could
not
help
asking
him
how
he
liked
his
supporters,
and
whether
he
did
not
think
they
did
honour
to
his
cause.
"But
it
is
a
pity,
lad,"
he
added,
"that
you
did
not
hang
these
four
samples
of
the
unwashed.
If
you
had
managed
that
feat,
the
gentry
here
would
have
riven
the
horses
out
of
the
coach,
yoked
to
a
score
of
asses,
and
drawn
you
into
Stilbro'
like
a
conquering
general."
Moore
soon
forsook
the
wine,
broke
from
the
