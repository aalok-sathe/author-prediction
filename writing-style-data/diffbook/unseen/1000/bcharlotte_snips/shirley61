when
the
world
has
rolled
round
a
few
times
more.
So
much
for
the
body.
The
soul
meantime
wings
its
long
flight
upward,
folds
its
wings
on
the
brink
of
the
sea
of
fire
and
glass,
and
gazing
down
through
the
burning
clearness,
finds
there
mirrored
the
vision
of
the
Christian's
triple
Godhead
the
sovereign
Father,
the
mediating
Son,
the
Creator
Spirit.
Such
words,
at
least,
have
been
chosen
to
express
what
is
inexpressible,
to
describe
what
baffles
description.
The
soul's
real
hereafter
who
shall
guess?"
Her
fire
was
decayed
to
its
last
cinder;
Malone
had
departed;
and
now
the
study
bell
rang
for
prayers.
The
next
day
Caroline
had
to
spend
altogether
alone,
her
uncle
being
gone
to
dine
with
his
friend
Dr.
Boultby,
vicar
of
Whinbury.
The
whole
time
she
was
talking
inwardly
in
the
same
strain
looking
forwards,
asking
what
she
was
to
do
with
life.
Fanny,
as
she
passed
in
and
out
of
the
room
occasionally,
intent
on
housemaid
errands,
perceived
that
her
young
mistress
sat
very
still.
She
was
always
in
the
same
place,
always
bent
industriously
over
a
piece
of
work.
She
did
not
lift
her
head
to
speak
to
Fanny,
as
her
custom
was;
and
when
the
latter
remarked
that
the
day
was
fine,
and
she
ought
to
take
a
walk,
she
only
said,
"It
is
cold."
"You
are
very
diligent
at
that
sewing,
Miss
Caroline,"
continued
the
girl,
approaching
her
little
table.
"I
am
tired
of
it,
Fanny."
"Then
why
do
you
go
on
with
it?
Put
it
down.
Read,
or
do
something
to
amuse
you."
"It
is
solitary
in
this
house,
Fanny.
Don't
you
think
so?"
"I
don't
find
it
so,
miss.
Me
and
Eliza
are
company
for
one
another;
but
you
are
quite
too
still.
You
should
visit
more.
Now,
be
persuaded:
go
upstairs
and
dress
yourself
smart,
and
go
and
take
tea,
in
a
friendly
way,
with
Miss
Mann
or
Miss
Ainley.
I
am
certain
either
of
those
ladies
would
be
delighted
to
see
you."
"But
their
houses
are
dismal:
they
are
both
old
maids.
I
am
certain
old
maids
are
a
very
unhappy
race."
"Not
they,
miss.
They
can't
be
unhappy;
they
take
such
care
of
themselves.
They
are
all
selfish."
"Miss
Ainley
is
not
selfish,
Fanny.
She
is
always
doing
good.
How
devotedly
kind
she
was
to
her
step
mother
as
long
as
the
old
lady
lived;
and
now
when
she
is
quite
alone
in
the
world,
without
brother
or
sister,
or
any
one
to
care
for
her,
how
charitable
she
is
to
the
poor,
as
far
as
her
means
permit!
Still
nobody
thinks
much
of
her,
or
has
pleasure
in
going
to
see
her;
and
how
gentlemen
always
sneer
at
her!"
"They
shouldn't,
miss.
I
believe
she
is
a
good
woman.
But
gentlemen
think
only
of
ladies'
looks."
"I'll
go
and
see
her,"
exclaimed
Caroline,
starting
up;
"and
if
she
asks
me
to
stay
to
tea,
I'll
stay.
How
wrong
it
is
to
neglect
people
because
they
are
not
pretty,
and
young,
and
merry!
And
I
will
certainly
call
to
see
Miss
Mann
too.
She
may
not
be
amiable,
but
what
has
made
her
unamiable?
What
has
life
been
to
her?"
Fanny
helped
Miss
Helstone
to
put
away
her
work,
and
afterwards
assisted
her
to
dress.
"You'll
not
be
an
old
maid,
Miss
Caroline,"
she
said,
as
she
tied
the
sash
of
her
brown
silk
frock,
having
previously
smoothed
her
soft,
full,
and
shining
curls;
"there
are
no
signs
of
an
old
maid
about
you."
Caroline
looked
at
the
little
mirror
before
her,
and
she
thought
there
were
some
signs.
She
could
see
that
she
was
altered
within
the
last
month;
that
the
hues
of
her
complexion
were
paler,
her
eyes
changed
a
wan
shade
seemed
to
circle
them;
her
countenance
was
dejected
she
was
not,
in
short,
so
pretty
or
so
fresh
as
she
used
to
be.
She
distantly
hinted
this
to
Fanny,
from
whom
she
got
no
direct
answer,
only
a
remark
that
people
did
vary
in
their
looks,
but
that
at
her
age
a
little
falling
away
signified
nothing;
she
would
soon
come
round
again,
and
be
plumper
and
rosier
than
ever.
Having
given
this
assurance,
Fanny
showed
singular
zeal
in
wrapping
her
up
in
warm
shawls
and
handkerchiefs,
till
Caroline,
nearly
smothered
with
the
weight,
was
fain
to
resist
further
additions.
She
paid
her
visits
first
to
Miss
Mann,
for
this
was
the
most
difficult
point.
Miss
Mann
was
certainly
not
quite
a
lovable
person.
Till
now,
Caroline
had
always
unhesitatingly
declared
she
disliked
her,
and
more
than
once
she
had
joined
her
cousin
Robert
in
laughing
at
some
of
her
peculiarities.
Moore
was
not
habitually
given
to
sarcasm,
especially
on
anything
humbler
or
weaker
than
himself;
but
he
had
once
or
twice
happened
to
be
in
the
room
when
Miss
Mann
had
made
a
call
on
his
sister,
and
after
listening
to
her
conversation
and
viewing
her
features
for
a
time,
he
had
gone
out
into
the
garden
where
his
little
cousin
was
tending
some
of
his
favourite
flowers,
and
while
standing
near
and
watching
her
he
had
amused
himself
with
comparing
fair
youth,
delicate
and
attractive,
with
shrivelled
eld,
livid
and
loveless,
and
in
jestingly
repeating
to
a
smiling
girl
the
vinegar
discourse
of
a
cankered
old
maid.
Once
on
such
an
occasion
Caroline
had
said
to
him,
looking
up
from
the
luxuriant
creeper
she
was
binding
to
its
frame,
"Ah!
Robert,
you
do
not
like
old
maids.
I,
too,
should
come
under
the
lash
of
your
sarcasm
if
I
were
an
old
maid."
"You
an
old
maid!"
he
had
replied.
"A
piquant
notion
suggested
by
lips
of
that
tint
and
form.
I
can
fancy
you,
though,
at
forty,
quietly
dressed,
pale
and
sunk,
but
still
with
that
straight
nose,
white
forehead,
and
those
soft
eyes.
I
suppose,
too,
you
will
keep
your
voice,
which
has
another
'timbre'
than
that
hard,
deep
organ
of
Miss
Mann's.
Courage,
Cary!
