him.
Mr.
Moore,
while
enjoying
the
genial
glow,
kept
his
eyes
directed
towards
the
glittering
brasses
on
the
shelf
above.
Chancing
for
an
instant
to
look
down,
his
glance
rested
on
an
uplifted
face,
flushed,
smiling,
happy,
shaded
with
silky
curls,
lit
with
fine
eyes.
Sarah
was
gone
into
the
parlour
with
the
tray;
a
lecture
from
her
mistress
detained
her
there.
Moore
placed
his
hand
a
moment
on
his
young
cousin's
shoulder,
stooped,
and
left
a
kiss
on
her
forehead.
"Oh!"
said
she,
as
if
the
action
had
unsealed
her
lips,
"I
was
miserable
when
I
thought
you
would
not
come.
I
am
almost
too
happy
now.
Are
you
happy,
Robert?
Do
you
like
to
come
home?"
"I
think
I
do
to
night,
at
least."
"Are
you
certain
you
are
not
fretting
about
your
frames,
and
your
business,
and
the
war?"
"Not
just
now."
"Are
you
positive
you
don't
feel
Hollow's
Cottage
too
small
for
you,
and
narrow,
and
dismal?"
"At
this
moment,
no."
"Can
you
affirm
that
you
are
not
bitter
at
heart
because
rich
and
great
people
forget
you?"
"No
more
questions.
You
are
mistaken
if
you
think
I
am
anxious
to
curry
favour
with
rich
and
great
people.
I
only
want
means
a
position
a
career."
"Which
your
own
talent
and
goodness
shall
win
you.
You
were
made
to
be
great;
you
shall
be
great."
"I
wonder
now,
if
you
spoke
honestly
out
of
your
heart,
what
recipe
you
would
give
me
for
acquiring
this
same
greatness;
but
I
know
it
better
than
you
know
it
yourself.
Would
it
be
efficacious?
Would
it
work?
Yes
poverty,
misery,
bankruptcy.
Oh,
life
is
not
what
you
think
it,
Lina!"
"But
you
are
what
I
think
you."
"I
am
not."
"You
are
better,
then?"
"Far
worse."
"No;
far
better.
I
know
you
are
good."
"How
do
you
know
it?"
"You
look
so,
and
I
feel
you
are
so."
"Where
do
you
feel
it?"
"In
my
heart."
"Ah!
You
judge
me
with
your
heart,
Lina:
you
should
judge
me
with
your
head."
"I
do;
and
then
I
am
quite
proud
of
you.
Robert,
you
cannot
tell
all
my
thoughts
about
you."
Mr.
Moore's
dark
face
mustered
colour;
his
lips
smiled,
and
yet
were
compressed;
his
eyes
laughed,
and
yet
he
resolutely
knit
his
brow.
"Think
meanly
of
me,
Lina,"
said
he.
"Men,
in
general,
are
a
sort
of
scum,
very
different
to
anything
of
which
you
have
an
idea.
I
make
no
pretension
to
be
better
than
my
fellows."
"If
you
did,
I
should
not
esteem
you
so
much.
It
is
because
you
are
modest
that
I
have
such
confidence
in
your
merit."
"Are
you
flattering
me?"
he
demanded,
turning
sharply
upon
her,
and
searching
her
face
with
an
eye
of
acute
penetration.
"No,"
she
said
softly,
laughing
at
his
sudden
quickness.
She
seemed
to
think
it
unnecessary
to
proffer
any
eager
disavowal
of
the
charge.
"You
don't
care
whether
I
think
you
flatter
me
or
not?"
"No."
"You
are
so
secure
of
your
own
intentions?"
"I
suppose
so."
"What
are
they,
Caroline?"
"Only
to
ease
my
mind
by
expressing
for
once
part
of
what
I
think,
and
then
to
make
you
better
satisfied
with
yourself."
"By
assuring
me
that
my
kinswoman
is
my
sincere
friend?"
"Just
so.
I
am
your
sincere
friend,
Robert."
"And
I
am
what
chance
and
change
shall
make
me,
Lina."
"Not
my
enemy,
however?"
The
answer
was
cut
short
by
Sarah
and
her
mistress
entering
the
kitchen
together
in
some
commotion.
They
had
been
improving
the
time
which
Mr.
Moore
and
Miss
Helstone
had
spent
in
dialogue
by
a
short
dispute
on
the
subject
of
"cafe
au
lait,"
which
Sarah
said
was
the
queerest
mess
she
ever
saw,
and
a
waste
of
God's
good
gifts,
as
it
was
"the
nature
of
coffee
to
be
boiled
in
water,"
and
which
mademoiselle
affirmed
to
be
"un
breuvage
royal,"
a
thousand
times
too
good
for
the
mean
person
who
objected
to
it.
The
former
occupants
of
the
kitchen
now
withdrew
into
the
parlour.
Before
Hortense
followed
them
thither,
Caroline
had
only
time
again
to
question,
"Not
my
enemy,
Robert?"
And
Moore,
Quaker
like,
had
replied
with
another
query,
"Could
I
be?"
And
then,
seating
himself
at
the
table,
had
settled
Caroline
at
his
side.
Caroline
scarcely
heard
mademoiselle's
explosion
of
wrath
when
she
rejoined
them;
the
long
declamation
about
the
"conduite
indigne
de
cette
mechante
creature"
sounded
in
her
ear
as
confusedly
as
the
agitated
rattling
of
the
china.
Robert
laughed
a
little
at
it,
in
very
subdued
sort,
and
then,
politely
and
calmly
entreating
his
sister
to
be
tranquil,
assured
her
that
if
it
would
yield
her
any
satisfaction,
she
should
have
her
choice
of
an
attendant
amongst
all
the
girls
in
his
mill.
Only
he
feared
they
would
scarcely
suit
her,
as
they
were
most
of
them,
he
was
informed,
completely
ignorant
of
household
work;
and
pert
and
self
willed
as
Sarah
was,
she
was,
perhaps,
no
worse
than
the
majority
of
the
women
of
her
class.
Mademoiselle
admitted
the
truth
of
this
conjecture:
according
to
her,
"ces
paysannes
anglaises
etaient
tout
insupportables."
What
would
she
not
give
for
some
"bonne
cuisiniere
anversoise,"
with
the
high
cap,
short
petticoat,
and
decent
sabots
proper
to
her
class
something
better,
indeed,
than
an
insolent
coquette
in
a
flounced
gown,
and
absolutely
without
cap!
(For
Sarah,
it
appears,
did
not
partake
the
opinion
of
St.
Paul
that
"it
is
a
shame
for
a
woman
to
go
with
her
head
uncovered;"
but,
holding
rather
a
contrary
doctrine,
resolutely
refused
to
imprison
in
linen
or
muslin
the
plentiful
tresses
of
her
yellow
hair,
which
it
was
her
wont
to
fasten
up
smartly
with
a
comb
behind,
and
on
Sundays
to
wear
curled
in
front.)
"Shall
I
try
and
get
you
an
Antwerp
girl?"
asked
Mr.
Moore,
who,
stern
in
public,
was
on
the
whole
very
kind
in
private.
"Merci
du
cadeau!"
was
the
answer.
"An
Antwerp
girl
would
not
stay
here
