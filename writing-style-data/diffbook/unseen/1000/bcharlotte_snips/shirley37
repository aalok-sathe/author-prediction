man
just
the
height
of
Robert.
For
one
second
she
thought
it
was
Robert
for
one
second
she
exulted;
but
the
voice
asking
for
Mr.
Helstone
undeceived
her.
That
voice
was
an
Irish
voice,
consequently
not
Moore's,
but
the
curate's
Malone's.
He
was
ushered
into
the
dining
room,
where,
doubtless,
he
speedily
helped
his
rector
to
empty
the
decanters.
It
was
a
fact
to
be
noted,
that
at
whatever
house
in
Briarfield,
Whinbury,
or
Nunnely
one
curate
dropped
in
to
a
meal
dinner
or
tea,
as,
the
case
might
be
another
presently
followed,
often
two
more.
Not
that
they
gave
each
other
the
rendezvous,
but
they
were
usually
all
on
the
run
at
the
same
time;
and
when
Donne,
for
instance,
sought
Malone
at
his
lodgings
and
found
him
not,
he
inquired
whither
he
had
posted,
and
having
learned
of
the
landlady
his
destination,
hastened
with
all
speed
after
him.
The
same
causes
operated
in
the
same
way
with
Sweeting.
Thus
it
chanced
on
that
afternoon
that
Caroline's
ears
were
three
times
tortured
with
the
ringing
of
the
bell
and
the
advent
of
undesired
guests;
for
Donne
followed
Malone,
and
Sweeting
followed
Donne;
and
more
wine
was
ordered
up
from
the
cellar
into
the
dining
room
(for
though
old
Helstone
chid
the
inferior
priesthood
when
he
found
them
"carousing,"
as
he
called
it,
in
their
own
tents,
yet
at
his
hierarchical
table
he
ever
liked
to
treat
them
to
a
glass
of
his
best),
and
through
the
closed
doors
Caroline
heard
their
boyish
laughter,
and
the
vacant
cackle
of
their
voices.
Her
fear
was
lest
they
should
stay
to
tea,
for
she
had
no
pleasure
in
making
tea
for
that
particular
trio.
What
distinctions
people
draw!
These
three
were
men
young
men
educated
men,
like
Moore;
yet,
for
her,
how
great
the
difference!
Their
society
was
a
bore
his
a
delight.
Not
only
was
she
destined
to
be
favoured
with
their
clerical
company,
but
Fortune
was
at
this
moment
bringing
her
four
other
guests
lady
guests,
all
packed
in
a
pony
phaeton
now
rolling
somewhat
heavily
along
the
road
from
Whinbury:
an
elderly
lady
and
three
of
her
buxom
daughters
were
coming
to
see
her
"in
a
friendly
way,"
as
the
custom
of
that
neighbourhood
was.
Yes,
a
fourth
time
the
bell
clanged.
Fanny
brought
the
present
announcement
to
the
drawing
room,
"Mrs.
Sykes
and
the
three
Misses
Sykes."
When
Caroline
was
going
to
receive
company,
her
habit
was
to
wring
her
hands
very
nervously,
to
flush
a
little,
and
come
forward
hurriedly
yet
hesitatingly,
wishing
herself
meantime
at
Jericho.
She
was,
at
such
crises,
sadly
deficient
in
finished
manner,
though
she
had
once
been
at
school
a
year.
Accordingly,
on
this
occasion,
her
small
white
hands
sadly
maltreated
each
other,
while
she
stood
up,
waiting
the
entrance
of
Mrs.
Sykes.
In
stalked
that
lady,
a
tall,
bilious
gentlewoman,
who
made
an
ample
and
not
altogether
insincere
profession
of
piety,
and
was
greatly
given
to
hospitality
towards
the
clergy.
In
sailed
her
three
daughters,
a
showy
trio,
being
all
three
well
grown,
and
more
or
less
handsome.
In
English
country
ladies
there
is
this
point
to
be
remarked.
Whether
young
or
old,
pretty
or
plain,
dull
or
sprightly,
they
all
(or
almost
all)
have
a
certain
expression
stamped
on
their
features,
which
seems
to
say,
"I
know
I
do
not
boast
of
it,
but
I
know
that
I
am
the
standard
of
what
is
proper;
let
every
one
therefore
whom
I
approach,
or
who
approaches
me,
keep
a
sharp
lookout,
for
wherein
they
differ
from
me
be
the
same
in
dress,
manner,
opinion,
principle,
or
practice
therein
they
are
wrong."
Mrs.
and
Misses
Sykes,
far
from
being
exceptions
to
this
observation,
were
pointed
illustrations
of
its
truth.
Miss
Mary
a
well
looked,
well
meant,
and,
on
the
whole,
well
dispositioned
girl
wore
her
complacency
with
some
state,
though
without
harshness.
Miss
Harriet
a
beauty
carried
it
more
overbearingly;
she
looked
high
and
cold.
Miss
Hannah,
who
was
conceited,
dashing,
pushing,
flourished
hers
consciously
and
openly.
The
mother
evinced
it
with
the
gravity
proper
to
her
age
and
religious
fame.
The
reception
was
got
through
somehow.
Caroline
"was
glad
to
see
them"
(an
unmitigated
fib),
hoped
they
were
well,
hoped
Mrs.
Sykes's
cough
was
better
(Mrs.
Sykes
had
had
a
cough
for
the
last
twenty
years),
hoped
the
Misses
Sykes
had
left
their
sisters
at
home
well;
to
which
inquiry
the
Misses
Sykes,
sitting
on
three
chairs
opposite
the
music
stool,
whereon
Caroline
had
undesignedly
come
to
anchor,
after
wavering
for
some
seconds
between
it
and
a
large
arm
chair,
into
which
she
at
length
recollected
she
ought
to
induct
Mrs.
Sykes
and
indeed
that
lady
saved
her
the
trouble
by
depositing
herself
therein
the
Misses
Sykes
replied
to
Caroline
by
one
simultaneous
bow,
very
majestic
and
mighty
awful.
A
pause
followed.
This
bow
was
of
a
character
to
ensure
silence
for
the
next
five
minutes,
and
it
did.
Mrs.
Sykes
then
inquired
after
Mr.
Helstone,
and
whether
he
had
had
any
return
of
rheumatism,
and
whether
preaching
twice
on
a
Sunday
fatigued
him,
and
if
he
was
capable
of
taking
a
full
service
now;
and
on
being
assured
he
was,
she
and
all
her
daughters,
combining
in
chorus,
expressed
their
opinion
that
he
was
"a
wonderful
man
of
his
years."
Pause
second.
Miss
Mary,
getting
up
the
steam
in
her
turn,
asked
whether
Caroline
had
attended
the
Bible
Society
meeting
which
had
been
held
at
Nunnely
last
Thursday
night.
The
negative
answer
which
truth
compelled
Caroline
to
utter
for
last
Thursday
evening
she
had
been
sitting
at
home,
reading
a
novel
which
Robert
had
lent
her
elicited
a
simultaneous
expression
of
surprise
from
the
lips
of
the
four
ladies.
"We
were
all
there,"
said
Miss
Mary
"mamma
and
all
of
us.
We
even
persuaded
papa
to
go.
Hannah
would
insist
upon
it.
But
he
fell
asleep
while
Mr.
Langweilig,
the
German
Moravian
minister,
was
speaking.
I
felt
quite
ashamed,
he
