have
the
avenues
to
the
house
crowded."
Yorkshire
people
are
as
yielding
to
persuasion
as
they
are
stubborn
against
compulsion.
The
yard
was
clear
in
five
minutes.
"Thank
you,
and
good
bye
to
you,
friends,"
said
Shirley,
as
she
closed
the
gates
on
a
quiet
court.
Now,
let
me
hear
the
most
refined
of
cockneys
presume
to
find
fault
with
Yorkshire
manners.
Taken
as
they
ought
to
be,
the
majority
of
the
lads
and
lasses
of
the
West
Riding
are
gentlemen
and
ladies,
every
inch
of
them.
It
is
only
against
the
weak
affectation
and
futile
pomposity
of
a
would
be
aristocrat
they
turn
mutinous.
Entering
by
the
back
way,
the
young
ladies
passed
through
the
kitchen
(or
house,
as
the
inner
kitchen
is
called)
to
the
hall.
Mrs.
Pryor
came
running
down
the
oak
staircase
to
meet
them.
She
was
all
unnerved;
her
naturally
sanguine
complexion
was
pale;
her
usually
placid,
though
timid,
blue
eye
was
wandering,
unsettled,
alarmed.
She
did
not,
however,
break
out
into
any
exclamations,
or
hurried
narrative
of
what
had
happened.
Her
predominant
feeling
had
been
in
the
course
of
the
night,
and
was
now
this
morning,
a
sense
of
dissatisfaction
with
herself
that
she
could
not
feel
firmer,
cooler,
more
equal
to
the
demands
of
the
occasion.
"You
are
aware,"
she
began
with
a
trembling
voice,
and
yet
the
most
conscientious
anxiety
to
avoid
exaggeration
in
what
she
was
about
to
say,
"that
a
body
of
rioters
has
attacked
Mr.
Moore's
mill
to
night.
We
heard
the
firing
and
confusion
very
plainly
here;
we
none
of
us
slept.
It
was
a
sad
night.
The
house
has
been
in
great
bustle
all
the
morning
with
people
coming
and
going.
The
servants
have
applied
to
me
for
orders
and
directions,
which
I
really
did
not
feel
warranted
in
giving.
Mr.
Moore
has,
I
believe,
sent
up
for
refreshments
for
the
soldiers
and
others
engaged
in
the
defence,
for
some
conveniences
also
for
the
wounded.
I
could
not
undertake
the
responsibility
of
giving
orders
or
taking
measures.
I
fear
delay
may
have
been
injurious
in
some
instances;
but
this
is
not
my
house.
You
were
absent,
my
dear
Miss
Keeldar.
What
could
I
do?"
"Were
no
refreshments
sent?"
asked
Shirley,
while
her
countenance,
hitherto
so
clear,
propitious,
and
quiet,
even
while
she
was
rating
the
milk
fetchers,
suddenly
turned
dark
and
warm.
"I
think
not,
my
dear."
"And
nothing
for
the
wounded
no
linen,
no
wine,
no
bedding?"
"I
think
not.
I
cannot
tell
what
Mrs.
Gill
did;
but
it
seemed
impossible
to
me,
at
the
moment,
to
venture
to
dispose
of
your
property
by
sending
supplies
to
soldiers.
Provisions
for
a
company
of
soldiers
sounds
formidable.
How
many
there
are
I
did
not
ask;
but
I
could
not
think
of
allowing
them
to
pillage
the
house,
as
it
were.
I
intended
to
do
what
was
right,
yet
I
did
not
see
the
case
quite
clearly,
I
own."
"It
lies
in
a
nutshell,
notwithstanding.
These
soldiers
have
risked
their
lives
in
defence
of
my
property:
I
suppose
they
have
a
right
to
my
gratitude.
The
wounded
are
our
fellow
creatures:
I
suppose
we
should
aid
them.
Mrs.
Gill!"
She
turned,
and
called
in
a
voice
more
clear
than
soft.
It
rang
through
the
thick
oak
of
the
hall
and
kitchen
doors
more
effectually
than
a
bell's
summons.
Mrs.
Gill,
who
was
deep
in
bread
making,
came
with
hands
and
apron
in
culinary
case,
not
having
dared
to
stop
to
rub
the
dough
from
the
one
or
to
shake
the
flour
from
the
other.
Her
mistress
had
never
called
a
servant
in
that
voice
save
once
before,
and
that
was
when
she
had
seen
from
the
window
Tartar
in
full
tug
with
two
carriers'
dogs,
each
of
them
a
match
for
him
in
size,
if
not
in
courage,
and
their
masters
standing
by,
encouraging
their
animals,
while
hers
was
unbefriended.
Then
indeed
she
had
summoned
John
as
if
the
Day
of
Judgment
were
at
hand.
Nor
had
she
waited
for
the
said
John's
coming,
but
had
walked
out
into
the
lane
bonnetless,
and
after
informing
the
carriers
that
she
held
them
far
less
of
men
than
the
three
brutes
whirling
and
worrying
in
the
dust
before
them,
had
put
her
hands
round
the
thick
neck
of
the
largest
of
the
curs,
and
given
her
whole
strength
to
the
essay
of
choking
it
from
Tartar's
torn
and
bleeding
eye,
just
above
and
below
which
organ
the
vengeful
fangs
were
inserted.
Five
or
six
men
were
presently
on
the
spot
to
help
her,
but
she
never
thanked
one
of
them.
"They
might
have
come
before
if
their
will
had
been
good,"
she
said.
She
had
not
a
word
for
anybody
during
the
rest
of
the
day,
but
sat
near
the
hall
fire
till
evening
watching
and
tending
Tartar,
who
lay
all
gory,
stiff,
and
swelled
on
a
mat
at
her
feet.
She
wept
furtively
over
him
sometimes,
and
murmured
the
softest
words
of
pity
and
endearment,
in
tones
whose
music
the
old,
scarred,
canine
warrior
acknowledged
by
licking
her
hand
or
her
sandal
alternately
with
his
own
red
wounds.
As
to
John,
his
lady
turned
a
cold
shoulder
on
him
for
a
week
afterwards.
Mrs.
Gill,
remembering
this
little
episode,
came
"all
of
a
tremble,"
as
she
said
herself.
In
a
firm,
brief
voice
Miss
Keeldar
proceeded
to
put
questions
and
give
orders.
That
at
such
a
time
Fieldhead
should
have
evinced
the
inhospitality
of
a
miser's
hovel
stung
her
haughty
spirit
to
the
quick;
and
the
revolt
of
its
pride
was
seen
in
the
heaving
of
her
heart,
stirred
stormily
under
the
lace
and
silk
which
veiled
it.
"How
long
is
it
since
that
message
came
from
the
mill?"
"Not
an
hour
yet,
ma'am,"
answered
the
housekeeper
soothingly.
"Not
an
hour!
You
might
almost
as
well
have
said
not
a
day.
They
will
have
applied
elsewhere
by
this
time.
Send
a
man
instantly
down
to
tell
them
that
everything
