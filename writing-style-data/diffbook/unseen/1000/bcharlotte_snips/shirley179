party,
and
took
the
road.
In
less
than
five
minutes
Mr.
Yorke
followed
him.
They
rode
out
of
Stilbro'
together.
It
was
early
to
go
home,
but
yet
it
was
late
in
the
day.
The
last
ray
of
the
sun
had
already
faded
from
the
cloud
edges,
and
the
October
night
was
casting
over
the
moorlands
the
shadow
of
her
approach.
Mr.
Yorke,
moderately
exhilarated
with
his
moderate
libations,
and
not
displeased
to
see
young
Moore
again
in
Yorkshire,
and
to
have
him
for
his
comrade
during
the
long
ride
home,
took
the
discourse
much
to
himself.
He
touched
briefly,
but
scoffingly,
on
the
trials
and
the
conviction;
he
passed
thence
to
the
gossip
of
the
neighbourhood,
and
ere
long
he
attacked
Moore
on
his
own
personal
concerns.
"Bob,
I
believe
you
are
worsted,
and
you
deserve
it.
All
was
smooth.
Fortune
had
fallen
in
love
with
you.
She
had
decreed
you
the
first
prize
in
her
wheel
twenty
thousand
pounds;
she
only
required
that
you
should
hold
your
hand
out
and
take
it.
And
what
did
you
do?
You
called
for
a
horse
and
rode
a
hunting
to
Warwickshire.
Your
sweetheart
Fortune,
I
mean
was
perfectly
indulgent.
She
said,
'I'll
excuse
him;
he's
young.'
She
waited,
like
'Patience
on
a
monument,'
till
the
chase
was
over
and
the
vermin
prey
run
down.
She
expected
you
would
come
back
then,
and
be
a
good
lad.
You
might
still
have
had
her
first
prize.
"It
capped
her
beyond
expression,
and
me
too,
to
find
that,
instead
of
thundering
home
in
a
breakneck
gallop
and
laying
your
assize
laurels
at
her
feet,
you
coolly
took
coach
up
to
London.
What
you
have
done
there
Satan
knows;
nothing
in
this
world,
I
believe,
but
sat
and
sulked.
Your
face
was
never
lily
fair,
but
it
is
olive
green
now.
You're
not
as
bonny
as
you
were,
man."
"And
who
is
to
have
this
prize
you
talk
so
much
about?"
"Only
a
baronet;
that
is
all.
I
have
not
a
doubt
in
my
own
mind
you've
lost
her.
She
will
be
Lady
Nunnely
before
Christmas."
"Hem!
Quite
probable."
"But
she
need
not
to
have
been.
Fool
of
a
lad!
I
swear
you
might
have
had
her."
"By
what
token,
Mr.
Yorke?"
"By
every
token
by
the
light
of
her
eyes,
the
red
of
her
cheeks.
Red
they
grew
when
your
name
was
mentioned,
though
of
custom
they
are
pale."
"My
chance
is
quite
over,
I
suppose?"
"It
ought
to
be.
But
try;
it
is
worth
trying.
I
call
this
Sir
Philip
milk
and
water.
And
then
he
writes
verses,
they
say
tags
rhymes.
You
are
above
that,
Bob,
at
all
events."
"Would
you
advise
me
to
propose,
late
as
it
is,
Mr.
Yorke
at
the
eleventh
hour?"
"You
can
but
make
the
experiment,
Robert.
If
she
has
a
fancy
for
you
and,
on
my
conscience,
I
believe
she
has
or
had
she
will
forgive
much.
But,
my
lad,
you
are
laughing.
Is
it
at
me?
You
had
better
grin
at
your
own
perverseness.
I
see,
however,
you
laugh
at
the
wrong
side
of
your
mouth.
You
have
as
sour
a
look
at
this
moment
as
one
need
wish
to
see."
"I
have
so
quarrelled
with
myself,
Yorke.
I
have
so
kicked
against
the
pricks,
and
struggled
in
a
strait
waistcoat,
and
dislocated
my
wrists
with
wrenching
them
in
handcuffs,
and
battered
my
hard
head
by
driving
it
against
a
harder
wall."
"Ha!
I'm
glad
to
hear
that.
Sharp
exercise
yon!
I
hope
it
has
done
you
good
ta'en
some
of
the
self
conceit
out
of
you?"
"Self
conceit?
What
is
it?
Self
respect,
self
tolerance
even,
what
are
they?
Do
you
sell
the
articles?
Do
you
know
anybody
who
does?
Give
an
indication.
They
would
find
in
me
a
liberal
chapman.
I
would
part
with
my
last
guinea
this
minute
to
buy."
"Is
it
so
with
you,
Robert?
I
find
that
spicy.
I
like
a
man
to
speak
his
mind.
What
has
gone
wrong?"
"The
machinery
of
all
my
nature;
the
whole
enginery
of
this
human
mill;
the
boiler,
which
I
take
to
be
the
heart,
is
fit
to
burst."
"That
suld
be
putten
i'
print;
it's
striking.
It's
almost
blank
verse.
Ye'll
be
jingling
into
poetry
just
e'now.
If
the
afflatus
comes,
give
way,
Robert.
Never
heed
me;
I'll
bear
it
this
whet
[time]."
"Hideous,
abhorrent,
base
blunder!
You
may
commit
in
a
moment
what
you
will
rue
for
years
what
life
cannot
cancel."
"Lad,
go
on.
I
call
it
pie,
nuts,
sugar
candy.
I
like
the
taste
uncommonly.
Go
on.
It
will
do
you
good
to
talk.
The
moor
is
before
us
now,
and
there
is
no
life
for
many
a
mile
round."
"I
will
talk.
I
am
not
ashamed
to
tell.
There
is
a
sort
of
wild
cat
in
my
breast,
and
I
choose
that
you
shall
hear
how
it
can
yell."
"To
me
it
is
music.
What
grand
voices
you
and
Louis
have!
When
Louis
sings
tones
off
like
a
soft,
deep
bell
I've
felt
myself
tremble
again.
The
night
is
still.
It
listens.
It
is
just
leaning
down
to
you,
like
a
black
priest
to
a
blacker
penitent.
Confess,
lad.
Smooth
naught
down.
Be
candid
as
a
convicted,
justified,
sanctified
Methody
at
an
experience
meeting.
Make
yourself
as
wicked
as
Beelzebub.
It
will
ease
your
mind."
"As
mean
as
Mammon,
you
would
say.
Yorke,
if
I
got
off
horseback
and
laid
myself
down
across
the
road,
would
you
have
the
goodness
to
gallop
over
me,
backwards
and
forwards,
about
twenty
times?"
"Wi'
all
the
pleasure
in
life,
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
a
coroner's
inquest."
"Hiram
Yorke,
I
certainly
believed
she
loved
me.
I
have
seen
her
eyes
sparkle
radiantly
when
she
has
found
me
out
in
a
crowd;
she
has
flushed
up
crimson
when
she
has
offered
me
her
hand,
and
said,
'How
do
you
do,
Mr.
Moore?'
"My
name
had
a
magical
influence
over
her.
