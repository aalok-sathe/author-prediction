Henry
to
the
door.
Without
hesitation
I
said,
'Go
where
you
will,
my
boy;
but,
till
I
call
you,
return
not
here.'
"Henry,
I
could
see,
did
not
like
his
dismissal.
That
boy
is
young,
but
a
thinker;
his
meditative
eye
shines
on
me
strangely
sometimes.
He
half
feels
what
links
me
to
Shirley;
he
half
guesses
that
there
is
a
dearer
delight
in
the
reserve
with
which
I
am
treated
than
in
all
the
endearments
he
is
allowed.
The
young,
lame,
half
grown
lion
would
growl
at
me
now
and
then,
because
I
have
tamed
his
lioness
and
am
her
keeper,
did
not
the
habit
of
discipline
and
the
instinct
of
affection
hold
him
subdued.
Go,
Henry;
you
must
learn
to
take
your
share
of
the
bitter
of
life
with
all
of
Adam's
race
that
have
gone
before
or
will
come
after
you.
Your
destiny
can
be
no
exception
to
the
common
lot;
be
grateful
that
your
love
is
overlooked
thus
early,
before
it
can
claim
any
affinity
to
passion.
An
hour's
fret,
a
pang
of
envy,
suffice
to
express
what
you
feel.
Jealousy
hot
as
the
sun
above
the
line,
rage
destructive
as
the
tropic
storm,
the
clime
of
your
sensations
ignores
as
yet.
"I
took
my
usual
seat
at
the
desk,
quite
in
my
usual
way.
I
am
blessed
in
that
power
to
cover
all
inward
ebullition
with
outward
calm.
No
one
who
looks
at
my
slow
face
can
guess
the
vortex
sometimes
whirling
in
my
heart,
and
engulfing
thought
and
wrecking
prudence.
Pleasant
is
it
to
have
the
gift
to
proceed
peacefully
and
powerfully
in
your
course
without
alarming
by
one
eccentric
movement.
It
was
not
my
present
intention
to
utter
one
word
of
love
to
her,
or
to
reveal
one
glimpse
of
the
fire
in
which
I
wasted.
Presumptuous
I
never
have
been;
presumptuous
I
never
will
be.
Rather
than
even
seem
selfish
and
interested,
I
would
resolutely
rise,
gird
my
loins,
part
and
leave
her,
and
seek,
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe,
a
new
life,
cold
and
barren
as
the
rock
the
salt
tide
daily
washes.
My
design
this
morning
was
to
take
of
her
a
near
scrutiny
to
read
a
line
in
the
page
of
her
heart.
Before
I
left
I
determined
to
know
what
I
was
leaving.
"I
had
some
quills
to
make
into
pens.
Most
men's
hands
would
have
trembled
when
their
hearts
were
so
stirred;
mine
went
to
work
steadily,
and
my
voice,
when
I
called
it
into
exercise,
was
firm.
"'This
day
week
you
will
be
alone
at
Fieldhead,
Miss
Keeldar.'
"'Yes:
I
rather
think
my
uncle's
intention
to
go
is
a
settled
one
now.'
"'He
leaves
you
dissatisfied.'
"'He
is
not
pleased
with
me.'
"'He
departs
as
he
came
no
better
for
his
journey.
This
is
mortifying.'
"'I
trust
the
failure
of
his
plans
will
take
from
him
all
inclination
to
lay
new
ones.'
"'In
his
way
Mr.
Sympson
honestly
wished
you
well.
All
he
has
done
or
intended
to
do
he
believed
to
be
for
the
best.'
"'You
are
kind
to
undertake
the
defence
of
a
man
who
has
permitted
himself
to
treat
you
with
so
much
insolence.'
"'I
never
feel
shocked
at,
or
bear
malice
for,
what
is
spoken
in
character;
and
most
perfectly
in
character
was
that
vulgar
and
violent
onset
against
me,
when
he
had
quitted
you
worsted.'
"'You
cease
now
to
be
Henry's
tutor?'
"'I
shall
be
parted
from
Henry
for
a
while
(if
he
and
I
live
we
shall
meet
again
somehow,
for
we
love
each
other)
and
be
ousted
from
the
bosom
of
the
Sympson
family
for
ever.
Happily
this
change
does
not
leave
me
stranded;
it
but
hurries
into
premature
execution
designs
long
formed.'
"'No
change
finds
you
off
your
guard.
I
was
sure,
in
your
calm
way,
you
would
be
prepared
for
sudden
mutation.
I
always
think
you
stand
in
the
world
like
a
solitary
but
watchful,
thoughtful
archer
in
a
wood.
And
the
quiver
on
your
shoulder
holds
more
arrows
than
one;
your
bow
is
provided
with
a
second
string.
Such
too
is
your
brother's
wont.
You
two
might
go
forth
homeless
hunters
to
the
loneliest
western
wilds;
all
would
be
well
with
you.
The
hewn
tree
would
make
you
a
hut,
the
cleared
forest
yield
you
fields
from
its
stripped
bosom,
the
buffalo
would
feel
your
rifle
shot,
and
with
lowered
horns
and
hump
pay
homage
at
your
feet.'
"'And
any
Indian
tribe
of
Blackfeet
or
Flatheads
would
afford
us
a
bride,
perhaps?'
"'No'
(hesitating),
'I
think
not.
The
savage
is
sordid.
I
think
that
is,
I
hope
you
would
neither
of
you
share
your
hearth
with
that
to
which
you
could
not
give
your
heart.'
"'What
suggested
the
wild
West
to
your
mind,
Miss
Keeldar?
Have
you
been
with
me
in
spirit
when
I
did
not
see
you?
Have
you
entered
into
my
day
dreams,
and
beheld
my
brain
labouring
at
its
scheme
of
a
future?'
"She
had
separated
a
slip
of
paper
for
lighting
tapers
a
spill,
as
it
is
called
into
fragments.
She
threw
morsel
by
morsel
into
the
fire,
and
stood
pensively
watching
them
consume.
She
did
not
speak.
"'How
did
you
learn
what
you
seem
to
know
about
my
intentions?'
"'I
know
nothing.
I
am
only
discovering
them
now.
I
spoke
at
hazard.'
"'Your
hazard
sounds
like
divination.
A
tutor
I
will
never
be
again;
never
take
a
pupil
after
Henry
and
yourself;
not
again
will
I
sit
habitually
at
another
man's
table
no
more
be
the
appendage
of
a
family.
I
am
now
a
man
of
thirty;
I
have
never
been
free
since
I
was
a
boy
of
ten.
I
have
such
a
thirst
for
freedom,
such
a
deep
passion
to
know
her
and
call
her
mine,
such
a
day
desire
and
night
longing
to
win
her
and
possess
her,
I
will
not
refuse
to
cross
the
Atlantic
for
her
sake;
her
I
will
follow
deep
into
virgin
woods.
