the
light
upstairs
with
her.
The
window
blind
was
not
drawn,
and
broad
moonbeams
poured
through
the
panes.
There
you
were,
Lina,
at
the
casement,
shrinking
a
little
to
one
side
in
an
attitude
not
unusual
with
you.
You
were
dressed
in
white,
as
I
have
seen
you
dressed
at
an
evening
party.
For
half
a
second
your
fresh,
living
face
seemed
turned
towards
me,
looking
at
me;
for
half
a
second
my
idea
was
to
go
and
take
your
hand,
to
chide
you
for
your
long
absence,
and
welcome
your
present
visit.
Two
steps
forward
broke
the
spell.
The
drapery
of
the
dress
changed
outline;
the
tints
of
the
complexion
dissolved,
and
were
formless.
Positively,
as
I
reached
the
spot,
there
was
nothing
left
but
the
sweep
of
a
white
muslin
curtain,
and
a
balsam
plant
in
a
flower
pot,
covered
with
a
flush
of
bloom.
'Sic
transit,'
et
cetera."
"It
was
not
my
wraith,
then?
I
almost
thought
it
was."
"No;
only
gauze,
crockery,
and
pink
blossom
a
sample
of
earthly
illusions."
"I
wonder
you
have
time
for
such
illusions,
occupied
as
your
mind
must
be."
"So
do
I.
But
I
find
in
myself,
Lina,
two
natures
one
for
the
world
and
business,
and
one
for
home
and
leisure.
Gerard
Moore
is
a
hard
dog,
brought
up
to
mill
and
market;
the
person
you
call
your
cousin
Robert
is
sometimes
a
dreamer,
who
lives
elsewhere
than
in
Cloth
hall
and
counting
house."
"Your
two
natures
agree
with
you.
I
think
you
are
looking
in
good
spirits
and
health.
You
have
quite
lost
that
harassed
air
which
it
often
pained
one
to
see
in
your
face
a
few
months
ago."
"Do
you
observe
that?
Certainly
I
am
disentangled
of
some
difficulties.
I
have
got
clear
of
some
shoals,
and
have
more
sea
room."
"And,
with
a
fair
wind,
you
may
now
hope
to
make
a
prosperous
voyage?"
"I
may
hope
it
yes
but
hope
is
deceptive.
There
is
no
controlling
wind
or
wave.
Gusts
and
swells
perpetually
trouble
the
mariner's
course;
he
dare
not
dismiss
from
his
mind
the
expectation
of
tempest."
"But
you
are
ready
for
a
breeze;
you
are
a
good
seaman,
an
able
commander.
You
are
a
skilful
pilot,
Robert;
you
will
weather
the
storm."
"My
kinswoman
always
thinks
the
best
of
me,
but
I
will
take
her
words
for
a
propitious
omen.
I
will
consider
that
in
meeting
her
to
night
I
have
met
with
one
of
those
birds
whose
appearance
is
to
the
sailor
the
harbinger
of
good
luck."
"A
poor
harbinger
of
good
luck
is
she
who
can
do
nothing,
who
has
no
power.
I
feel
my
incapacity.
It
is
of
no
use
saying
I
have
the
will
to
serve
you
when
I
cannot
prove
it.
Yet
I
have
that
will.
I
wish
you
success.
I
wish
you
high
fortune
and
true
happiness."
"When
did
you
ever
wish
me
anything
else?
What
is
Fanny
waiting
for?
I
told
her
to
walk
on.
Oh!
we
have
reached
the
churchyard.
Then
we
are
to
part
here,
I
suppose.
We
might
have
sat
a
few
minutes
in
the
church
porch,
if
the
girl
had
not
been
with
us.
It
is
so
fine
a
night,
so
summer
mild
and
still,
I
have
no
particular
wish
to
return
yet
to
the
Hollow."
"But
we
cannot
sit
in
the
porch
now,
Robert."
Caroline
said
this
because
Moore
was
turning
her
round
towards
it.
"Perhaps
not.
But
tell
Fanny
to
go
in.
Say
we
are
coming.
A
few
minutes
will
make
no
difference."
The
church
clock
struck
ten.
"My
uncle
will
be
coming
out
to
take
his
usual
sentinel
round,
and
he
always
surveys
the
church
and
churchyard."
"And
if
he
does?
If
it
were
not
for
Fanny,
who
knows
we
are
here,
I
should
find
pleasure
in
dodging
and
eluding
him.
We
could
be
under
the
east
window
when
he
is
at
the
porch;
as
he
came
round
to
the
north
side
we
could
wheel
off
to
the
south;
we
might
at
a
pinch
hide
behind
some
of
the
monuments.
That
tall
erection
of
the
Wynnes
would
screen
us
completely."
"Robert,
what
good
spirits
you
have!
Go!
go!"
added
Caroline
hastily.
"I
hear
the
front
door
"
"I
don't
want
to
go;
on
the
contrary,
I
want
to
stay."
"You
know
my
uncle
will
be
terribly
angry.
He
forbade
me
to
see
you
because
you
are
a
Jacobin."
"A
queer
Jacobin!"
"Go,
Robert,
he
is
coming;
I
hear
him
cough."
"Diable!
It
is
strange
what
a
pertinacious
wish
I
feel
to
stay!"
"You
remember
what
he
did
to
Fanny's
"
began
Caroline,
and
stopped
abruptly
short.
"Sweetheart"
was
the
word
that
ought
to
have
followed,
but
she
could
not
utter
it.
It
seemed
calculated
to
suggest
ideas
she
had
no
intention
to
suggest
ideas
delusive
and
disturbing.
Moore
was
less
scrupulous.
"Fanny's
sweetheart?"
he
said
at
once.
"He
gave
him
a
shower
bath
under
the
pump,
did
he
not?
He'd
do
as
much
for
me,
I
dare
say,
with
pleasure.
I
should
like
to
provoke
the
old
Turk
not,
however,
against
you.
But
he
would
make
a
distinction
between
a
cousin
and
a
lover,
would
he
not?"
"Oh,
he
would
not
think
of
you
in
that
way,
of
course
not;
his
quarrel
with
you
is
entirely
political.
Yet
I
should
not
like
the
breach
to
be
widened,
and
he
is
so
testy.
Here
he
is
at
the
garden
gate.
For
your
own
sake
and
mine,
Robert,
go!"
The
beseeching
words
were
aided
by
a
beseeching
gesture
and
a
more
beseeching
look.
Moore
covered
her
clasped
hands
an
instant
with
his,
answered
her
upward
by
a
downward
gaze,
said
"Good
night!"
and
went.
Caroline
was
in
a
moment
at
the
kitchen
door
behind
Fanny.
The
shadow
of
the
shovel
hat
at
that
very
instant
fell
on
a
moonlit
tomb.
The
rector
emerged,
erect
as
a
cane,
from
his
garden,
and
proceeded
in
slow
march,
his
hands
behind
him,
down
the
