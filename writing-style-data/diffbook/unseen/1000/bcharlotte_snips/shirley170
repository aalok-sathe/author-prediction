ever
complain
to
your
mother
or
sisters?"
"Never.
She
laughs
at
them
when
they
question
her.
Mr.
Moore,
she
is
a
strange
being,
so
fair
and
girlish
not
a
man
like
woman
at
all,
not
an
Amazon,
and
yet
lifting
her
head
above
both
help
and
sympathy."
"Do
you
know
where
she
is
now,
Henry?
Is
she
in
the
house,
or
riding
out?"
"Surely
not
out,
sir.
It
rains
fast."
"True;
which,
however,
is
no
guarantee
that
she
is
not
at
this
moment
cantering
over
Rushedge.
Of
late
she
has
never
permitted
weather
to
be
a
hindrance
to
her
rides."
"You
remember,
Mr.
Moore,
how
wet
and
stormy
it
was
last
Wednesday
so
wild,
indeed,
that
she
would
not
permit
Zoe
to
be
saddled?
Yet
the
blast
she
thought
too
tempestuous
for
her
mare
she
herself
faced
on
foot;
that
afternoon
she
walked
nearly
as
far
as
Nunnely.
I
asked
her,
when
she
came
in,
if
she
was
not
afraid
of
taking
cold.
'Not
I,'
she
said.
'It
would
be
too
much
good
luck
for
me.
I
don't
know,
Harry,
but
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
me
would
be
to
take
a
good
cold
and
fever,
and
so
pass
off
like
other
Christians.'
She
is
reckless,
you
see,
sir."
"Reckless
indeed!
Go
and
find
out
where
she
is,
and
if
you
can
get
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
without
attracting
attention,
request
her
to
come
here
a
minute."
"Yes,
sir."
He
snatched
his
crutch,
and
started
up
to
go.
"Harry!"
He
returned.
"Do
not
deliver
the
message
formally.
Word
it
as,
in
former
days,
you
would
have
worded
an
ordinary
summons
to
the
schoolroom."
"I
see,
sir.
She
will
be
more
likely
to
obey."
"And,
Harry
"
"Sir?"
"I
will
call
you
when
I
want
you.
Till
then,
you
are
dispensed
from
lessons."
He
departed.
Mr.
Moore,
left
alone,
rose
from
his
desk.
"I
can
be
very
cool
and
very
supercilious
with
Henry,"
he
said.
"I
can
seem
to
make
light
of
his
apprehensions,
and
look
down
du
haut
de
ma
grandeur
on
his
youthful
ardour.
To
him
I
can
speak
as
if,
in
my
eyes,
they
were
both
children.
Let
me
see
if
I
can
keep
up
the
same
role
with
her.
I
have
known
the
moment
when
I
seemed
about
to
forget
it,
when
Confusion
and
Submission
seemed
about
to
crush
me
with
their
soft
tyranny,
when
my
tongue
faltered,
and
I
have
almost
let
the
mantle
drop,
and
stood
in
her
presence,
not
master
no
but
something
else.
I
trust
I
shall
never
so
play
the
fool.
It
is
well
for
a
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
to
redden
when
he
meets
her
eye.
He
may
permit
himself
the
indulgence
of
submission.
He
may
even,
without
disgrace,
suffer
his
hand
to
tremble
when
it
touches
hers;
but
if
one
of
her
farmers
were
to
show
himself
susceptible
and
sentimental,
he
would
merely
prove
his
need
of
a
strait
waistcoat.
So
far
I
have
always
done
very
well.
She
has
sat
near
me,
and
I
have
not
shaken
more
than
my
desk.
I
have
encountered
her
looks
and
smiles
like
why,
like
a
tutor,
as
I
am.
Her
hand
I
never
yet
touched
never
underwent
that
test.
Her
farmer
or
her
footman
I
am
not
no
serf
nor
servant
of
hers
have
I
ever
been;
but
I
am
poor,
and
it
behoves
me
to
look
to
my
self
respect
not
to
compromise
an
inch
of
it.
What
did
she
mean
by
that
allusion
to
the
cold
people
who
petrify
flesh
to
marble?
It
pleased
me
I
hardly
know
why;
I
would
not
permit
myself
to
inquire.
I
never
do
indulge
in
scrutiny
either
of
her
language
or
countenance;
for
if
I
did,
I
should
sometimes
forget
common
sense
and
believe
in
romance.
A
strange,
secret
ecstasy
steals
through
my
veins
at
moments.
I'll
not
encourage
I'll
not
remember
it.
I
am
resolved,
as
long
as
may
be,
to
retain
the
right
to
say
with
Paul,
'I
am
not
mad,
but
speak
forth
the
words
of
truth
and
soberness.'"
He
paused,
listening.
"Will
she
come,
or
will
she
not
come?"
he
inquired.
"How
will
she
take
the
message?
Naively
or
disdainfully?
Like
a
child
or
like
a
queen?
Both
characters
are
in
her
nature.
"If
she
comes,
what
shall
I
say
to
her?
How
account,
firstly,
for
the
freedom
of
the
request?
Shall
I
apologize
to
her?
I
could
in
all
humility;
but
would
an
apology
tend
to
place
us
in
the
positions
we
ought
relatively
to
occupy
in
this
matter?
I
must
keep
up
the
professor,
otherwise
I
hear
a
door."
He
waited.
Many
minutes
passed.
"She
will
refuse
me.
Henry
is
entreating
her
to
come;
she
declines.
My
petition
is
presumption
in
her
eyes.
Let
her
only
come,
I
can
teach
her
to
the
contrary.
I
would
rather
she
were
a
little
perverse;
it
will
steel
me.
I
prefer
her
cuirassed
in
pride,
armed
with
a
taunt.
Her
scorn
startles
me
from
my
dreams;
I
stand
up
myself.
A
sarcasm
from
her
eyes
or
lips
puts
strength
into
every
nerve
and
sinew
I
have.
Some
step
approaches,
and
not
Henry's."
The
door
unclosed;
Miss
Keeldar
came
in.
The
message,
it
appeared,
had
found
her
at
her
needle;
she
brought
her
work
in
her
hand.
That
day
she
had
not
been
riding
out;
she
had
evidently
passed
it
quietly.
She
wore
her
neat
indoor
dress
and
silk
apron.
This
was
no
Thalestris
from
the
fields,
but
a
quiet
domestic
character
from
the
fireside.
Mr.
Moore
had
her
at
advantage.
He
should
have
addressed
her
at
once
in
solemn
accents,
and
with
rigid
mien.
Perhaps
he
would,
had
she
looked
saucy;
but
her
air
never
showed
less
of
cranerie.
A
soft
kind
of
youthful
shyness
depressed
her
eyelid
and
mantled
on
her
cheek.
The
tutor
stood
silent.
She
made
a
full
stop
between
the
door
and
his
desk.
"Did
you
want
me,
sir?"
she
asked.
"I
ventured,
Miss
