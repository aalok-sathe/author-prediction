Of
late
years
an
abundant
shower
of
curates
has
fallen
upon
the
north
of
England:
they
lie
very
thick
on
the
hills;
every
parish
has
one
or
more
of
them;
they
are
young
enough
to
be
very
active,
and
ought
to
be
doing
a
great
deal
of
good.
But
not
of
late
years
are
we
about
to
speak;
we
are
going
back
to
the
beginning
of
this
century:
late
years
present
years
are
dusty,
sunburnt,
hot,
arid;
we
will
evade
the
noon,
forget
it
in
siesta,
pass
the
midday
in
slumber,
and
dream
of
dawn.
If
you
think,
from
this
prelude,
that
anything
like
a
romance
is
preparing
for
you,
reader,
you
never
were
more
mistaken.
Do
you
anticipate
sentiment,
and
poetry,
and
reverie?
Do
you
expect
passion,
and
stimulus,
and
melodrama?
Calm
your
expectations;
reduce
them
to
a
lowly
standard.
Something
real,
cool,
and
solid
lies
before
you;
something
unromantic
as
Monday
morning,
when
all
who
have
work
wake
with
the
consciousness
that
they
must
rise
and
betake
themselves
thereto.
It
is
not
positively
affirmed
that
you
shall
not
have
a
taste
of
the
exciting,
perhaps
towards
the
middle
and
close
of
the
meal,
but
it
is
resolved
that
the
first
dish
set
upon
the
table
shall
be
one
that
a
Catholic
ay,
even
an
Anglo
Catholic
might
eat
on
Good
Friday
in
Passion
Week:
it
shall
be
cold
lentils
and
vinegar
without
oil;
it
shall
be
unleavened
bread
with
bitter
herbs,
and
no
roast
lamb.
Of
late
years,
I
say,
an
abundant
shower
of
curates
has
fallen
upon
the
north
of
England;
but
in
eighteen
hundred
eleven
twelve
that
affluent
rain
had
not
descended.
Curates
were
scarce
then:
there
was
no
Pastoral
Aid
no
Additional
Curates'
Society
to
stretch
a
helping
hand
to
worn
out
old
rectors
and
incumbents,
and
give
them
the
wherewithal
to
pay
a
vigorous
young
colleague
from
Oxford
or
Cambridge.
The
present
successors
of
the
apostles,
disciples
of
Dr.
Pusey
and
tools
of
the
Propaganda,
were
at
that
time
being
hatched
under
cradle
blankets,
or
undergoing
regeneration
by
nursery
baptism
in
wash
hand
basins.
You
could
not
have
guessed
by
looking
at
any
one
of
them
that
the
Italian
ironed
double
frills
of
its
net
cap
surrounded
the
brows
of
a
preordained,
specially
sanctified
successor
of
St.
Paul,
St.
Peter,
or
St.
John;
nor
could
you
have
foreseen
in
the
folds
of
its
long
night
gown
the
white
surplice
in
which
it
was
hereafter
cruelly
to
exercise
the
souls
of
its
parishioners,
and
strangely
to
nonplus
its
old
fashioned
vicar
by
flourishing
aloft
in
a
pulpit
the
shirt
like
raiment
which
had
never
before
waved
higher
than
the
reading
desk.
Yet
even
in
those
days
of
scarcity
there
were
curates:
the
precious
plant
was
rare,
but
it
might
be
found.
A
certain
favoured
district
in
the
West
Riding
of
Yorkshire
could
boast
three
rods
of
Aaron
blossoming
within
a
circuit
of
twenty
miles.
You
shall
see
them,
reader.
Step
into
this
neat
garden
house
on
the
skirts
of
Whinbury,
walk
forward
into
the
little
parlour.
There
they
are
at
dinner.
Allow
me
to
introduce
them
to
you:
Mr.
Donne,
curate
of
Whinbury;
Mr.
Malone,
curate
of
Briarfield;
Mr.
Sweeting,
curate
of
Nunnely.
These
are
Mr.
Donne's
lodgings,
being
the
habitation
of
one
John
Gale,
a
small
clothier.
Mr.
Donne
has
kindly
invited
his
brethren
to
regale
with
him.
You
and
I
will
join
the
party,
see
what
is
to
be
seen,
and
hear
what
is
to
be
heard.
At
present,
however,
they
are
only
eating;
and
while
they
eat
we
will
talk
aside.
These
gentlemen
are
in
the
bloom
of
youth;
they
possess
all
the
activity
of
that
interesting
age
an
activity
which
their
moping
old
vicars
would
fain
turn
into
the
channel
of
their
pastoral
duties,
often
expressing
a
wish
to
see
it
expended
in
a
diligent
superintendence
of
the
schools,
and
in
frequent
visits
to
the
sick
of
their
respective
parishes.
But
the
youthful
Levites
feel
this
to
be
dull
work;
they
prefer
lavishing
their
energies
on
a
course
of
proceeding
which,
though
to
other
eyes
it
appear
more
heavy
with
ennui,
more
cursed
with
monotony,
than
the
toil
of
the
weaver
at
his
loom,
seems
to
yield
them
an
unfailing
supply
of
enjoyment
and
occupation.
I
allude
to
a
rushing
backwards
and
forwards,
amongst
themselves,
to
and
from
their
respective
lodgings
not
a
round,
but
a
triangle
of
visits,
which
they
keep
up
all
the
year
through,
in
winter,
spring,
summer,
and
autumn.
Season
and
weather
make
no
difference;
with
unintelligible
zeal
they
dare
snow
and
hail,
wind
and
rain,
mire
and
dust,
to
go
and
dine,
or
drink
tea,
or
sup
with
each
other.
What
attracts
them
it
would
be
difficult
to
say.
It
is
not
friendship,
for
whenever
they
meet
they
quarrel.
It
is
not
religion
the
thing
is
never
named
amongst
them;
theology
they
may
discuss
occasionally,
but
piety
never.
It
is
not
the
love
of
eating
and
drinking:
each
might
have
as
good
a
joint
and
pudding,
tea
as
potent,
and
toast
as
succulent,
at
his
own
lodgings,
as
is
served
to
him
at
his
brother's.
Mrs.
Gale,
Mrs.
Hogg,
and
Mrs.
Whipp
their
respective
landladies
affirm
that
"it
is
just
for
naught
else
but
to
give
folk
trouble."
By
"folk"
the
good
ladies
of
course
mean
themselves,
for
indeed
they
are
kept
in
a
continual
"fry"
by
this
system
of
mutual
invasion.
Mr.
Donne
and
his
guests,
as
I
have
said,
are
at
dinner;
Mrs.
Gale
waits
on
them,
but
a
spark
of
the
hot
kitchen
fire
is
in
her
eye.
She
considers
that
the
privilege
of
inviting
a
friend
to
a
meal
occasionally,
without
additional
charge
(a
privilege
included
in
the
terms
on
which
she
lets
her
lodgings),
has
been
quite
sufficiently
exercised
of
late.
The
present
week
is
yet
but
at
Thursday,
and
on
Monday
Mr.
Malone,
the
curate
of
Briarfield,
came
to
breakfast
and
stayed
dinner;
on
Tuesday
Mr.
Malone
and
Mr.
Sweeting
