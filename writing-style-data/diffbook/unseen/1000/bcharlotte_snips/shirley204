I
triumphed
over
her
mercilessly."
"What
right
had
you
to
triumph?
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
fancy
free?"
"Whatever
I
am,
Shirley
is
a
bondswoman.
Lioness,
she
has
found
her
captor.
Mistress
she
may
be
of
all
round
her,
but
her
own
mistress
she
is
not."
"So
you
exulted
at
recognizing
a
fellow
slave
in
one
so
fair
and
imperial?"
"I
did;
Robert,
you
say
right,
in
one
so
fair
and
imperial."
"You
confess
it
a
fellow
slave?"
"I
confess
nothing;
but
I
say
that
haughty
Shirley
is
no
more
free
than
was
Hagar."
"And
who,
pray,
is
the
Abraham,
the
hero
of
a
patriarch
who
has
achieved
such
a
conquest?"
"You
still
speak
scornfully,
and
cynically,
and
sorely;
but
I
will
make
you
change
your
note
before
I
have
done
with
you."
"We
will
see
that.
Can
she
marry
this
Cupidon?"
"Cupidon!
he
is
just
about
as
much
a
Cupidon
as
you
are
a
Cyclops."
"Can
she
marry
him?"
"You
will
see."
"I
want
to
know
his
name,
Cary."
"Guess
it."
"Is
it
any
one
in
this
neighbourhood?"
"Yes,
in
Briarfield
parish."
"Then
it
is
some
person
unworthy
of
her.
I
don't
know
a
soul
in
Briarfield
parish
her
equal."
"Guess."
"Impossible.
I
suppose
she
is
under
a
delusion,
and
will
plunge
into
some
absurdity,
after
all."
Caroline
smiled.
"Do
you
approve
the
choice?"
asked
Moore.
"Quite,
quite."
"Then
I
am
puzzled;
for
the
head
which
owns
this
bounteous
fall
of
hazel
curls
is
an
excellent
little
thinking
machine,
most
accurate
in
its
working.
It
boasts
a
correct,
steady
judgment,
inherited
from
'mamma,'
I
suppose."
"And
I
quite
approve,
and
mamma
was
charmed."
"'Mamma'
charmed
Mrs.
Pryor!
It
can't
be
romantic,
then?"
"It
is
romantic,
but
it
is
also
right."
"Tell
me,
Cary
tell
me
out
of
pity;
I
am
too
weak
to
be
tantalized."
"You
shall
be
tantalized
it
will
do
you
no
harm;
you
are
not
so
weak
as
you
pretend."
"I
have
twice
this
evening
had
some
thoughts
of
falling
on
the
floor
at
your
feet."
"You
had
better
not.
I
shall
decline
to
help
you
up."
"And
worshipping
you
downright.
My
mother
was
a
Roman
Catholic.
You
look
like
the
loveliest
of
her
pictures
of
the
Virgin.
I
think
I
will
embrace
her
faith
and
kneel
and
adore."
"Robert,
Robert,
sit
still;
don't
be
absurd.
I
will
go
to
Hortense
if
you
commit
extravagances."
"You
have
stolen
my
senses.
Just
now
nothing
will
come
into
my
mind
but
les
litanies
de
la
sainte
Vierge.
Rose
celeste,
reine
des
anges!"
"Tour
d'ivoire,
maison
d'or
is
not
that
the
jargon?
Well,
sit
down
quietly,
and
guess
your
riddle."
"But
'mamma'
charmed
there's
the
puzzle."
"I'll
tell
you
what
mamma
said
when
I
told
her.
'Depend
upon
it,
my
dear,
such
a
choice
will
make
the
happiness
of
Miss
Keeldar's
life.'"
"I'll
guess
once,
and
no
more.
It
is
old
Helstone.
She
is
going
to
be
your
aunt."
"I'll
tell
my
uncle;
I'll
tell
Shirley!"
cried
Caroline,
laughing
gleefully.
"Guess
again,
Robert;
your
blunders
are
charming."
"It
is
the
parson
Hall."
"Indeed,
no;
he
is
mine,
if
you
please."
"Yours!
Ay,
the
whole
generation
of
women
in
Briarfield
seem
to
have
made
an
idol
of
that
priest.
I
wonder
why;
he
is
bald,
sand
blind,
gray
haired."
"Fanny
will
be
here
to
fetch
me
before
you
have
solved
the
riddle,
if
you
don't
make
haste."
"I'll
guess
no
more
I
am
tired;
and
then
I
don't
care.
Miss
Keeldar
may
marry
le
grand
Turc
for
me."
"Must
I
whisper?"
"That
you
must,
and
quickly.
Here
comes
Hortense;
come
near,
a
little
nearer,
my
own
Lina.
I
care
for
the
whisper
more
than
the
words."
She
whispered.
Robert
gave
a
start,
a
flash
of
the
eye,
a
brief
laugh.
Miss
Moore
entered,
and
Sarah
followed
behind,
with
information
that
Fanny
was
come.
The
hour
of
converse
was
over.
Robert
found
a
moment
to
exchange
a
few
more
whispered
sentences.
He
was
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
as
Caroline
descended
after
putting
on
her
shawl.
"Must
I
call
Shirley
a
noble
creature
now?"
he
asked.
"If
you
wish
to
speak
the
truth,
certainly."
"Must
I
forgive
her?"
"Forgive
her?
Naughty
Robert!
Was
she
in
the
wrong,
or
were
you?"
"Must
I
at
length
love
her
downright,
Cary?"
Caroline
looked
keenly
up,
and
made
a
movement
towards
him,
something
between
the
loving
and
the
petulant.
"Only
give
the
word,
and
I'll
try
to
obey
you."
"Indeed,
you
must
not
love
her;
the
bare
idea
is
perverse."
"But
then
she
is
handsome,
peculiarly
handsome.
Hers
is
a
beauty
that
grows
on
you.
You
think
her
but
graceful
when
you
first
see
her;
you
discover
her
to
be
beautiful
when
you
have
known
her
for
a
year."
"It
is
not
you
who
are
to
say
these
things.
Now,
Robert,
be
good."
"O
Cary,
I
have
no
love
to
give.
Were
the
goddess
of
beauty
to
woo
me,
I
could
not
meet
her
advances.
There
is
no
heart
which
I
can
call
mine
in
this
breast."
"So
much
the
better;
you
are
a
great
deal
safer
without.
Good
night."
"Why
must
you
always
go,
Lina,
at
the
very
instant
when
I
most
want
you
to
stay?"
"Because
you
most
wish
to
retain
when
you
are
most
certain
to
lose."
"Listen;
one
other
word.
Take
care
of
your
own
heart
do
you
hear
me?"
"There
is
no
danger."
"I
am
not
convinced
of
that.
The
Platonic
parson,
for
instance."
"Who
Malone?"
"Cyril
Hall.
I
owe
more
than
one
twinge
of
jealousy
to
that
quarter."
"As
to
you,
you
have
been
flirting
with
Miss
Mann.
She
showed
me
the
other
day
a
plant
you
had
given
her.
Fanny,
I
am
ready."
Louis
Moore's
doubts
respecting
the
immediate
evacuation
of
Fieldhead
by
Mr.
Sympson
turned
out
to
be
perfectly
well
founded.
The
very
next
day
after
the
grand
quarrel
about
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
a
sort
of
reconciliation
was
patched
up
between
uncle
and
