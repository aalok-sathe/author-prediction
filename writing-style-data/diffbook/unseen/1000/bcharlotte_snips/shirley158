cosy
circle
now
enclosing
the
bright
little
schoolroom
fire.
She
then
took
the
post
of
toaster
general;
and
kneeling
on
the
rug,
fork
in
hand,
fulfilled
her
office
with
dexterity.
Mr.
Hall,
who
relished
any
homely
innovation
on
ordinary
usages,
and
to
whom
the
husky
oatcake
was
from
custom
suave
as
manna,
seemed
in
his
best
spirits.
He
talked
and
laughed
gleefully
now
with
Caroline,
whom
he
had
fixed
by
his
side,
now
with
Shirley,
and
again
with
Louis
Moore.
And
Louis
met
him
in
congenial
spirit.
He
did
not
laugh
much,
but
he
uttered
in
the
quietest
tone
the
wittiest
things.
Gravely
spoken
sentences,
marked
by
unexpected
turns
and
a
quite
fresh
flavour
and
poignancy,
fell
easily
from
his
lips.
He
proved
himself
to
be
what
Mr.
Hall
had
said
he
was
excellent
company.
Caroline
marvelled
at
his
humour,
but
still
more
at
his
entire
self
possession.
Nobody
there
present
seemed
to
impose
on
him
a
sensation
of
unpleasant
restraint.
Nobody
seemed
a
bore
a
check
a
chill
to
him;
and
yet
there
was
the
cool
and
lofty
Miss
Keeldar
kneeling
before
the
fire,
almost
at
his
feet.
But
Shirley
was
cool
and
lofty
no
longer,
at
least
not
at
this
moment.
She
appeared
unconscious
of
the
humility
of
her
present
position;
or
if
conscious,
it
was
only
to
taste
a
charm
in
its
lowliness.
It
did
not
revolt
her
pride
that
the
group
to
whom
she
voluntarily
officiated
as
handmaid
should
include
her
cousin's
tutor.
It
did
not
scare
her
that
while
she
handed
the
bread
and
milk
to
the
rest,
she
had
to
offer
it
to
him
also;
and
Moore
took
his
portion
from
her
hand
as
calmly
as
if
he
had
been
her
equal.
"You
are
overheated
now,"
he
said,
when
she
had
retained
the
fork
for
some
time;
"let
me
relieve
you."
And
he
took
it
from
her
with
a
sort
of
quiet
authority,
to
which
she
submitted
passively,
neither
resisting
him
nor
thanking
him.
"I
should
like
to
see
your
pictures,
Louis,"
said
Caroline,
when
the
sumptuous
luncheon
was
discussed.
"Would
not
you,
Mr.
Hall?"
"To
please
you,
I
should;
but,
for
my
own
part,
I
have
cut
him
as
an
artist.
I
had
enough
of
him
in
that
capacity
in
Cumberland
and
Westmoreland.
Many
a
wetting
we
got
amongst
the
mountains
because
he
would
persist
in
sitting
on
a
camp
stool,
catching
effects
of
rain
clouds,
gathering
mists,
fitful
sunbeams,
and
what
not."
"Here
is
the
portfolio,"
said
Henry,
bringing
it
in
one
hand
and
leaning
on
his
crutch
with
the
other.
Louis
took
it,
but
he
still
sat
as
if
he
wanted
another
to
speak.
It
seemed
as
if
he
would
not
open
it
unless
the
proud
Shirley
deigned
to
show
herself
interested
in
the
exhibition.
"He
makes
us
wait
to
whet
our
curiosity,"
she
said.
"You
understand
opening
it,"
observed
Louis,
giving
her
the
key.
"You
spoiled
the
lock
for
me
once;
try
now."
He
held
it.
She
opened
it,
and,
monopolizing
the
contents,
had
the
first
view
of
every
sketch
herself.
She
enjoyed
the
treat
if
treat
it
were
in
silence,
without
a
single
comment.
Moore
stood
behind
her
chair
and
looked
over
her
shoulder,
and
when
she
had
done
and
the
others
were
still
gazing,
he
left
his
post
and
paced
through
the
room.
A
carriage
was
heard
in
the
lane
the
gate
bell
rang.
Shirley
started.
"There
are
callers,"
she
said,
"and
I
shall
be
summoned
to
the
room.
A
pretty
figure
as
they
say
I
am
to
receive
company.
I
and
Henry
have
been
in
the
garden
gathering
fruit
half
the
morning.
Oh
for
rest
under
my
own
vine
and
my
own
fig
tree!
Happy
is
the
slave
wife
of
the
Indian
chief,
in
that
she
has
no
drawing
room
duty
to
perform,
but
can
sit
at
ease
weaving
mats,
and
stringing
beads,
and
peacefully
flattening
her
pickaninny's
head
in
an
unmolested
corner
of
her
wigwam.
I'll
emigrate
to
the
western
woods."
Louis
Moore
laughed.
"To
marry
a
White
Cloud
or
a
Big
Buffalo,
and
after
wedlock
to
devote
yourself
to
the
tender
task
of
digging
your
lord's
maize
field
while
he
smokes
his
pipe
or
drinks
fire
water."
Shirley
seemed
about
to
reply,
but
here
the
schoolroom
door
unclosed,
admitting
Mr.
Sympson.
That
personage
stood
aghast
when
he
saw
the
group
around
the
fire.
"I
thought
you
alone,
Miss
Keeldar,"
he
said.
"I
find
quite
a
party."
And
evidently
from
his
shocked,
scandalized
air,
had
he
not
recognized
in
one
of
the
party
a
clergyman,
he
would
have
delivered
an
extempore
philippic
on
the
extraordinary
habits
of
his
niece:
respect
for
the
cloth
arrested
him.
"I
merely
wished
to
announce,"
he
proceeded
coldly,
"that
the
family
from
De
Walden
Hall,
Mr.,
Mrs.,
the
Misses,
and
Mr.
Sam
Wynne,
are
in
the
drawing
room."
And
he
bowed
and
withdrew.
"The
family
from
De
Walden
Hall!
Couldn't
be
a
worse
set,"
murmured
Shirley.
She
sat
still,
looking
a
little
contumacious,
and
very
much
indisposed
to
stir.
She
was
flushed
with
the
fire.
Her
dark
hair
had
been
more
than
once
dishevelled
by
the
morning
wind
that
day.
Her
attire
was
a
light,
neatly
fitting,
but
amply
flowing
dress
of
muslin;
the
shawl
she
had
worn
in
the
garden
was
still
draped
in
a
careless
fold
round
her.
Indolent,
wilful,
picturesque,
and
singularly
pretty
was
her
aspect
prettier
than
usual,
as
if
some
soft
inward
emotion,
stirred
who
knows
how,
had
given
new
bloom
and
expression
to
her
features.
"Shirley,
Shirley,
you
ought
to
go,"
whispered
Caroline.
"I
wonder
why?"
She
lifted
her
eyes,
and
saw
in
the
glass
over
the
fireplace
both
Mr.
Hall
and
Louis
Moore
gazing
at
her
gravely.
"If,"
she
said,
with
a
yielding
smile
"if
a
majority
of
the
present
company
maintain
that
the
De
Walden
Hall
people
have
claims
on
my
civility,
I
will
subdue
my
inclinations
to
my
duty.
Let
those
who
think
I
ought
to
go
hold
up
their
hands."
Again
