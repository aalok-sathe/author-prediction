as
her
light
step
traversed
the
gallery
in
the
course
of
a
day,
it
did
not
again
pause
at
his
door;
nor
did
her
"cooing,
vibrating
voice"
disturb
a
second
time
the
hush
of
the
sickroom.
A
sickroom,
indeed,
it
soon
ceased
to
be;
Mr.
Moore's
good
constitution
quickly
triumphed
over
his
indisposition.
In
a
few
days
he
shook
it
off,
and
resumed
his
duties
as
tutor.
That
"auld
lang
syne"
had
still
its
authority
both
with
preceptor
and
scholar
was
proved
by
the
manner
in
which
he
sometimes
promptly
passed
the
distance
she
usually
maintained
between
them,
and
put
down
her
high
reserve
with
a
firm,
quiet
hand.
One
afternoon
the
Sympson
family
were
gone
out
to
take
a
carriage
airing.
Shirley,
never
sorry
to
snatch
a
reprieve
from
their
society,
had
remained
behind,
detained
by
business,
as
she
said.
The
business
a
little
letter
writing
was
soon
dispatched
after
the
yard
gates
had
closed
on
the
carriage;
Miss
Keeldar
betook
herself
to
the
garden.
It
was
a
peaceful
autumn
day.
The
gilding
of
the
Indian
summer
mellowed
the
pastures
far
and
wide.
The
russet
woods
stood
ripe
to
be
stripped,
but
were
yet
full
of
leaf.
The
purple
of
heath
bloom,
faded
but
not
withered,
tinged
the
hills.
The
beck
wandered
down
to
the
Hollow,
through
a
silent
district;
no
wind
followed
its
course
or
haunted
its
woody
borders.
Fieldhead
gardens
bore
the
seal
of
gentle
decay.
On
the
walks,
swept
that
morning,
yellow
leaves
had
fluttered
down
again.
Its
time
of
flowers,
and
even
of
fruits,
was
over;
but
a
scantling
of
apples
enriched
the
trees.
Only
a
blossom
here
and
there
expanded
pale
and
delicate
amidst
a
knot
of
faded
leaves.
These
single
flowers
the
last
of
their
race
Shirley
culled
as
she
wandered
thoughtfully
amongst
the
beds.
She
was
fastening
into
her
girdle
a
hueless
and
scentless
nosegay,
when
Henry
Sympson
called
to
her
as
he
came
limping
from
the
house.
"Shirley,
Mr.
Moore
would
be
glad
to
see
you
in
the
schoolroom
and
to
hear
you
read
a
little
French,
if
you
have
no
more
urgent
occupation."
The
messenger
delivered
his
commission
very
simply,
as
if
it
were
a
mere
matter
of
course.
"Did
Mr.
Moore
tell
you
to
say
that?"
"Certainly;
why
not?
And
now,
do
come,
and
let
us
once
more
be
as
we
were
at
Sympson
Grove.
We
used
to
have
pleasant
school
hours
in
those
days."
Miss
Keeldar
perhaps
thought
that
circumstances
were
changed
since
then;
however,
she
made
no
remark,
but
after
a
little
reflection
quietly
followed
Henry.
Entering
the
schoolroom,
she
inclined
her
head
with
a
decent
obeisance,
as
had
been
her
wont
in
former
times.
She
removed
her
bonnet,
and
hung
it
up
beside
Henry's
cap.
Louis
Moore
sat
at
his
desk,
turning
the
leaves
of
a
book,
open
before
him,
and
marking
passages
with
his
pencil.
He
just
moved,
in
acknowledgment
of
her
curtsy,
but
did
not
rise.
"You
proposed
to
read
to
me
a
few
nights
ago,"
said
he.
"I
could
not
hear
you
then.
My
attention
is
now
at
your
service.
A
little
renewed
practice
in
French
may
not
be
unprofitable.
Your
accent,
I
have
observed,
begins
to
rust."
"What
book
shall
I
take?"
"Here
are
the
posthumous
works
of
St.
Pierre.
Read
a
few
pages
of
the
'Fragments
de
l'Amazone.'"
She
accepted
the
chair
which
he
had
placed
in
readiness
near
his
own;
the
volume
lay
on
his
desk
there
was
but
one
between
them;
her
sweeping
curls
dropped
so
low
as
to
hide
the
page
from
him.
"Put
back
your
hair,"
he
said.
For
one
moment
Shirley
looked
not
quite
certain
whether
she
would
obey
the
request
or
disregard
it.
A
flicker
of
her
eye
beamed
furtive
on
the
professor's
face.
Perhaps
if
he
had
been
looking
at
her
harshly
or
timidly,
or
if
one
undecided
line
had
marked
his
countenance,
she
would
have
rebelled,
and
the
lesson
had
ended
there
and
then;
but
he
was
only
awaiting
her
compliance
as
calm
as
marble,
and
as
cool.
She
threw
the
veil
of
tresses
behind
her
ear.
It
was
well
her
face
owned
an
agreeable
outline,
and
that
her
cheek
possessed
the
polish
and
the
roundness
of
early
youth,
or,
thus
robbed
of
a
softening
shade,
the
contours
might
have
lost
their
grace.
But
what
mattered
that
in
the
present
society?
Neither
Calypso
nor
Eucharis
cared
to
fascinate
Mentor.
She
began
to
read.
The
language
had
become
strange
to
her
tongue;
it
faltered;
the
lecture
flowed
unevenly,
impeded
by
hurried
breath,
broken
by
Anglicized
tones.
She
stopped.
"I
can't
do
it.
Read
me
a
paragraph,
if
you
please,
Mr.
Moore."
What
he
read
she
repeated.
She
caught
his
accent
in
three
minutes.
"Tres
bien,"
was
the
approving
comment
at
the
close
of
the
piece.
"C'est
presque
le
Francais
rattrape,
n'est
ce
pas?"
"You
could
not
write
French
as
you
once
could,
I
dare
say?"
"Oh
no!
I
should
make
strange
work
of
my
concords
now."
"You
could
not
compose
the
devoir
of
'La
Premiere
Femme
Savante'?"
"Do
you
still
remember
that
rubbish?"
"Every
line."
"I
doubt
you."
"I
will
engage
to
repeat
it
word
for
word."
"You
would
stop
short
at
the
first
line."
"Challenge
me
to
the
experiment."
"I
challenge
you."
He
proceeded
to
recite
the
following.
He
gave
it
in
French,
but
we
must
translate,
on
pain
of
being
unintelligible
to
some
readers.
"And
it
came
to
pass,
when
men
began
to
multiply
on
the
face
of
the
earth,
and
daughters
were
born
unto
them,
that
the
sons
of
God
saw
the
daughters
of
men
that
they
were
fair;
and
they
took
them
wives
of
all
which
they
chose."
This
was
in
the
dawn
of
time,
before
the
morning
stars
were
set,
and
while
they
yet
sang
together.
The
epoch
is
so
remote,
the
mists
and
dewy
gray
of
matin
twilight
veil
it
with
so
vague
an
obscurity,
that
all
distinct
feature
of
custom,
all
clear
line
of
locality,
evade
perception
