sun.
That
sun
rose
broad
on
Whitsuntide.
The
gathering
of
the
schools
was
signalized
by
splendid
weather.
Whit
Tuesday
was
the
great
day,
in
preparation
for
which
the
two
large
schoolrooms
of
Briarfield,
built
by
the
present
rector,
chiefly
at
his
own
expense,
were
cleaned
out,
whitewashed,
repainted,
and
decorated
with
flowers
and
evergreens
some
from
the
rectory
garden,
two
cartloads
from
Fieldhead,
and
a
wheel
barrowful
from
the
more
stingy
domain
of
De
Walden,
the
residence
of
Mr.
Wynne.
In
these
schoolrooms
twenty
tables,
each
calculated
to
accommodate
twenty
guests,
were
laid
out,
surrounded
with
benches,
and
covered
with
white
cloths.
Above
them
were
suspended
at
least
some
twenty
cages,
containing
as
many
canaries,
according
to
a
fancy
of
the
district,
specially
cherished
by
Mr.
Helstone's
clerk,
who
delighted
in
the
piercing
song
of
these
birds,
and
knew
that
amidst
confusion
of
tongues
they
always
carolled
loudest.
These
tables,
be
it
understood,
were
not
spread
for
the
twelve
hundred
scholars
to
be
assembled
from
the
three
parishes,
but
only
for
the
patrons
and
teachers
of
the
schools.
The
children's
feast
was
to
be
spread
in
the
open
air.
At
one
o'clock
the
troops
were
to
come
in;
at
two
they
were
to
be
marshalled;
till
four
they
were
to
parade
the
parish;
then
came
the
feast,
and
afterwards
the
meeting,
with
music
and
speechifying
in
the
church.
Why
Briarfield
was
chosen
for
the
point
of
rendezvous
the
scene
of
the
fete
should
be
explained.
It
was
not
because
it
was
the
largest
or
most
populous
parish
Whinbury
far
outdid
it
in
that
respect;
nor
because
it
was
the
oldest,
antique
as
were
the
hoary
church
and
rectory
Nunnely's
low
roofed
temple
and
mossy
parsonage,
buried
both
in
coeval
oaks,
outstanding
sentinels
of
Nunnwood,
were
older
still.
It
was
simply
because
Mr.
Helstone
willed
it
so,
and
Mr.
Helstone's
will
was
stronger
than
that
of
Boultby
or
Hall;
the
former
could
not,
the
latter
would
not,
dispute
a
point
of
precedence
with
their
resolute
and
imperious
brother.
They
let
him
lead
and
rule.
This
notable
anniversary
had
always
hitherto
been
a
trying
day
to
Caroline
Helstone,
because
it
dragged
her
perforce
into
public,
compelling
her
to
face
all
that
was
wealthy,
respectable,
influential
in
the
neighbourhood;
in
whose
presence,
but
for
the
kind
countenance
of
Mr.
Hall,
she
would
have
appeared
unsupported.
Obliged
to
be
conspicuous;
obliged
to
walk
at
the
head
of
her
regiment
as
the
rector's
niece,
and
first
teacher
of
the
first
class;
obliged
to
make
tea
at
the
first
table
for
a
mixed
multitude
of
ladies
and
gentlemen,
and
to
do
all
this
without
the
countenance
of
mother,
aunt,
or
other
chaperon
she,
meantime,
being
a
nervous
person,
who
mortally
feared
publicity
it
will
be
comprehended
that,
under
these
circumstances,
she
trembled
at
the
approach
of
Whitsuntide.
But
this
year
Shirley
was
to
be
with
her,
and
that
changed
the
aspect
of
the
trial
singularly
it
changed
it
utterly.
It
was
a
trial
no
longer
it
was
almost
an
enjoyment.
Miss
Keeldar
was
better
in
her
single
self
than
a
host
of
ordinary
friends.
Quite
self
possessed,
and
always
spirited
and
easy;
conscious
of
her
social
importance,
yet
never
presuming
upon
it
it
would
be
enough
to
give
one
courage
only
to
look
at
her.
The
only
fear
was
lest
the
heiress
should
not
be
punctual
to
tryst.
She
often
had
a
careless
way
of
lingering
behind
time,
and
Caroline
knew
her
uncle
would
not
wait
a
second
for
any
one.
At
the
moment
of
the
church
clock
tolling
two,
the
bells
would
clash
out
and
the
march
begin.
She
must
look
after
Shirley,
then,
in
this
matter,
or
her
expected
companion
would
fail
her.
Whit
Tuesday
saw
her
rise
almost
with
the
sun.
She,
Fanny,
and
Eliza
were
busy
the
whole
morning
arranging
the
rectory
parlours
in
first
rate
company
order,
and
setting
out
a
collation
of
cooling
refreshments
wine,
fruit,
cakes
on
the
dining
room
sideboard.
Then
she
had
to
dress
in
her
freshest
and
fairest
attire
of
white
muslin:
the
perfect
fineness
of
the
day
and
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
warranted,
and
even
exacted,
such
costume.
Her
new
sash
a
birthday
present
from
Margaret
Hall,
which
she
had
reason
to
believe
Cyril
himself
had
bought,
and
in
return
for
which
she
had
indeed
given
him
a
set
of
cambric
bands
in
a
handsome
case
was
tied
by
the
dexterous
fingers
of
Fanny,
who
took
no
little
pleasure
in
arraying
her
fair
young
mistress
for
the
occasion.
Her
simple
bonnet
had
been
trimmed
to
correspond
with
her
sash;
her
pretty
but
inexpensive
scarf
of
white
crape
suited
her
dress.
When
ready
she
formed
a
picture,
not
bright
enough
to
dazzle,
but
fair
enough
to
interest;
not
brilliantly
striking,
but
very
delicately
pleasing
a
picture
in
which
sweetness
of
tint,
purity
of
air,
and
grace
of
mien
atoned
for
the
absence
of
rich
colouring
and
magnificent
contour.
What
her
brown
eye
and
clear
forehead
showed
of
her
mind
was
in
keeping
with
her
dress
and
face
modest,
gentle,
and,
though
pensive,
harmonious.
It
appeared
that
neither
lamb
nor
dove
need
fear
her,
but
would
welcome
rather,
in
her
look
of
simplicity
and
softness,
a
sympathy
with
their
own
natures,
or
with
the
natures
we
ascribe
to
them.
After
all,
she
was
an
imperfect,
faulty
human
being,
fair
enough
of
form,
hue,
and
array,
but,
as
Cyril
Hall
said,
neither
so
good
nor
so
great
as
the
withered
Miss
Ainley,
now
putting
on
her
best
black
gown
and
Quaker
drab
shawl
and
bonnet
in
her
own
narrow
cottage
chamber.
Away
Caroline
went,
across
some
very
sequestered
fields
and
through
some
quite
hidden
lanes,
to
Fieldhead.
She
glided
quickly
under
the
green
hedges
and
across
the
greener
leas.
There
was
no
dust,
no
moisture,
to
soil
the
hem
of
her
stainless
garment,
or
to
damp
her
slender
sandal.
After
the
late
rains
all
was
clean,
and
under
the
present
glowing
sun
all
was
dry.
She
walked
