the
signification
of
such
words
as
vele,
firrum,
hellum,
storrum
(so
Mr.
Malone
invariably
pronounced
veil,
firm,
helm,
storm),
and
employing
such
other
methods
of
retaliation
as
the
innate
refinement
of
their
minds
suggested.
This,
of
course,
would
not
do.
Malone,
being
neither
good
natured
nor
phlegmatic,
was
presently
in
a
towering
passion.
He
vociferated,
gesticulated;
Donne
and
Sweeting
laughed.
He
reviled
them
as
Saxons
and
snobs
at
the
very
top
pitch
of
his
high
Celtic
voice;
they
taunted
him
with
being
the
native
of
a
conquered
land.
He
menaced
rebellion
in
the
name
of
his
"counthry,"
vented
bitter
hatred
against
English
rule;
they
spoke
of
rags,
beggary,
and
pestilence.
The
little
parlour
was
in
an
uproar;
you
would
have
thought
a
duel
must
follow
such
virulent
abuse;
it
seemed
a
wonder
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gale
did
not
take
alarm
at
the
noise,
and
send
for
a
constable
to
keep
the
peace.
But
they
were
accustomed
to
such
demonstrations;
they
well
knew
that
the
curates
never
dined
or
took
tea
together
without
a
little
exercise
of
the
sort,
and
were
quite
easy
as
to
consequences,
knowing
that
these
clerical
quarrels
were
as
harmless
as
they
were
noisy,
that
they
resulted
in
nothing,
and
that,
on
whatever
terms
the
curates
might
part
to
night,
they
would
be
sure
to
meet
the
best
friends
in
the
world
to
morrow
morning.
As
the
worthy
pair
were
sitting
by
their
kitchen
fire,
listening
to
the
repeated
and
sonorous
contact
of
Malone's
fist
with
the
mahogany
plane
of
the
parlour
table,
and
to
the
consequent
start
and
jingle
of
decanters
and
glasses
following
each
assault,
to
the
mocking
laughter
of
the
allied
English
disputants,
and
the
stuttering
declamation
of
the
isolated
Hibernian
as
they
thus
sat,
a
foot
was
heard
on
the
outer
door
step,
and
the
knocker
quivered
to
a
sharp
appeal.
Mr.
Gale
went
and
opened.
"Whom
have
you
upstairs
in
the
parlour?"
asked
a
voice
a
rather
remarkable
voice,
nasal
in
tone,
abrupt
in
utterance.
"O
Mr.
Helstone,
is
it
you,
sir?
I
could
hardly
see
you
for
the
darkness;
it
is
so
soon
dark
now.
Will
you
walk
in,
sir?"
"I
want
to
know
first
whether
it
is
worth
my
while
walking
in.
Whom
have
you
upstairs?"
"The
curates,
sir."
"What!
all
of
them?"
"Yes,
sir."
"Been
dining
here?"
"Yes,
sir."
"That
will
do."
With
these
words
a
person
entered
a
middle
aged
man,
in
black.
He
walked
straight
across
the
kitchen
to
an
inner
door,
opened
it,
inclined
his
head
forward,
and
stood
listening.
There
was
something
to
listen
to,
for
the
noise
above
was
just
then
louder
than
ever.
"Hey!"
he
ejaculated
to
himself;
then
turning
to
Mr.
Gale
"Have
you
often
this
sort
of
work?"
Mr.
Gale
had
been
a
churchwarden,
and
was
indulgent
to
the
clergy.
"They're
young,
you
know,
sir
they're
young,"
said
he
deprecatingly.
"Young!
They
want
caning.
Bad
boys
bad
boys!
And
if
you
were
a
Dissenter,
John
Gale,
instead
of
being
a
good
Churchman,
they'd
do
the
like
they'd
expose
themselves;
but
I'll
"
By
way
of
finish
to
this
sentence,
he
passed
through
the
inner
door,
drew
it
after
him,
and
mounted
the
stair.
Again
he
listened
a
few
minutes
when
he
arrived
at
the
upper
room.
Making
entrance
without
warning,
he
stood
before
the
curates.
And
they
were
silent;
they
were
transfixed;
and
so
was
the
invader.
He
a
personage
short
of
stature,
but
straight
of
port,
and
bearing
on
broad
shoulders
a
hawk's
head,
beak,
and
eye,
the
whole
surmounted
by
a
Rehoboam,
or
shovel
hat,
which
he
did
not
seem
to
think
it
necessary
to
lift
or
remove
before
the
presence
in
which
he
then
stood
he
folded
his
arms
on
his
chest
and
surveyed
his
young
friends,
if
friends
they
were,
much
at
his
leisure.
"What!"
he
began,
delivering
his
words
in
a
voice
no
longer
nasal,
but
deep
more
than
deep
a
voice
made
purposely
hollow
and
cavernous
"what!
has
the
miracle
of
Pentecost
been
renewed?
Have
the
cloven
tongues
come
down
again?
Where
are
they?
The
sound
filled
the
whole
house
just
now.
I
heard
the
seventeen
languages
in
full
action:
Parthians,
and
Medes,
and
Elamites,
the
dwellers
in
Mesopotamia,
and
in
Judea,
and
Cappadocia,
in
Pontus
and
Asia,
Phrygia
and
Pamphylia,
in
Egypt
and
in
the
parts
of
Libya
about
Cyrene,
strangers
of
Rome,
Jews
and
proselytes,
Cretes
and
Arabians;
every
one
of
these
must
have
had
its
representative
in
this
room
two
minutes
since."
"I
beg
your
pardon,
Mr.
Helstone,"
began
Mr.
Donne;
"take
a
seat,
pray,
sir.
Have
a
glass
of
wine?"
His
civilities
received
no
answer.
The
falcon
in
the
black
coat
proceeded,
"What
do
I
talk
about
the
gift
of
tongues?
Gift,
indeed!
I
mistook
the
chapter,
and
book,
and
Testament
gospel
for
law,
Acts
for
Genesis,
the
city
of
Jerusalem
for
the
plain
of
Shinar.
It
was
no
gift
but
the
confusion
of
tongues
which
has
gabbled
me
deaf
as
a
post.
You,
apostles?
What!
you
three?
Certainly
not;
three
presumptuous
Babylonish
masons
neither
more
nor
less!"
"I
assure
you,
sir,
we
were
only
having
a
little
chat
together
over
a
glass
of
wine
after
a
friendly
dinner
settling
the
Dissenters!"
"Oh!
settling
the
Dissenters,
were
you?
Was
Malone
settling
the
Dissenters?
It
sounded
to
me
much
more
like
settling
his
co
apostles.
You
were
quarrelling
together,
making
almost
as
much
noise
you
three
alone
as
Moses
Barraclough,
the
preaching
tailor,
and
all
his
hearers
are
making
in
the
Methodist
chapel
down
yonder,
where
they
are
in
the
thick
of
a
revival.
I
know
whose
fault
it
is.
It
is
yours,
Malone."
"Mine,
sir?"
"Yours,
sir.
Donne
and
Sweeting
were
quiet
before
you
came,
and
would
be
quiet
if
you
were
gone.
I
wish,
when
you
crossed
the
Channel,
you
had
left
your
Irish
habits
behind
you.
Dublin
student
ways
won't
do
here.
The
proceedings
which
might
pass
unnoticed
in
a
wild
bog
and
mountain
district
in
Connaught
will,
