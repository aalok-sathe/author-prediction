right
mind,
do
you
think,
sir?"
inquired
Sweeting
simply.
"Can't
tell,
Davy.
He
may
be
crazed,
or
he
may
be
only
crafty,
or
perhaps
a
little
of
both."
"He
talks
of
seeing
visions,
sir."
"Ay!
He
is
a
very
Ezekiel
or
Daniel
for
visions.
He
came
just
when
I
was
going
to
bed
last
Friday
night
to
describe
one
that
had
been
revealed
to
him
in
Nunnely
Park
that
very
afternoon."
"Tell
it,
sir.
What
was
it?"
urged
Sweeting.
"Davy,
thou
hast
an
enormous
organ
of
wonder
in
thy
cranium.
Malone,
you
see,
has
none.
Neither
murders
nor
visions
interest
him.
See
what
a
big
vacant
Saph
he
looks
at
this
moment."
"Saph!
Who
was
Saph,
sir?"
"I
thought
you
would
not
know.
You
may
find
it
out.
It
is
biblical.
I
know
nothing
more
of
him
than
his
name
and
race;
but
from
a
boy
upwards
I
have
always
attached
a
personality
to
Saph.
Depend
on
it
he
was
honest,
heavy,
and
luckless.
He
met
his
end
at
Gob
by
the
hand
of
Sibbechai."
"But
the
vision,
sir?"
"Davy,
thou
shalt
hear.
Donne
is
biting
his
nails,
and
Malone
yawning,
so
I
will
tell
it
but
to
thee.
Mike
is
out
of
work,
like
many
others,
unfortunately.
Mr.
Grame,
Sir
Philip
Nunnely's
steward,
gave
him
a
job
about
the
priory.
According
to
his
account,
Mike
was
busy
hedging
rather
late
in
the
afternoon,
but
before
dark,
when
he
heard
what
he
thought
was
a
band
at
a
distance
bugles,
fifes,
and
the
sound
of
a
trumpet;
it
came
from
the
forest,
and
he
wondered
that
there
should
be
music
there.
He
looked
up.
All
amongst
the
trees
he
saw
moving
objects,
red,
like
poppies,
or
white,
like
may
blossom.
The
wood
was
full
of
them;
they
poured
out
and
filled
the
park.
He
then
perceived
they
were
soldiers
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands;
but
they
made
no
more
noise
than
a
swarm
of
midges
on
a
summer
evening.
They
formed
in
order,
he
affirmed,
and
marched,
regiment
after
regiment,
across
the
park.
He
followed
them
to
Nunnely
Common;
the
music
still
played
soft
and
distant.
On
the
common
he
watched
them
go
through
a
number
of
evolutions.
A
man
clothed
in
scarlet
stood
in
the
centre
and
directed
them.
They
extended,
he
declared,
over
fifty
acres.
They
were
in
sight
half
an
hour;
then
they
marched
away
quite
silently.
The
whole
time
he
heard
neither
voice
nor
tread
nothing
but
the
faint
music
playing
a
solemn
march."
"Where
did
they
go,
sir?"
"Towards
Briarfield.
Mike
followed
them.
They
seemed
passing
Fieldhead,
when
a
column
of
smoke,
such
as
might
be
vomited
by
a
park
of
artillery,
spread
noiseless
over
the
fields,
the
road,
the
common,
and
rolled,
he
said,
blue
and
dim,
to
his
very
feet.
As
it
cleared
away
he
looked
again
for
the
soldiers,
but
they
were
vanished;
he
saw
them
no
more.
Mike,
like
a
wise
Daniel
as
he
is,
not
only
rehearsed
the
vision
but
gave
the
interpretation
thereof.
It
signifies,
he
intimated,
bloodshed
and
civil
conflict."
"Do
you
credit
it,
sir?"
asked
Sweeting.
"Do
you,
Davy?
But
come,
Malone;
why
are
you
not
off?"
"I
am
rather
surprised,
sir,
you
did
not
stay
with
Moore
yourself.
You
like
this
kind
of
thing."
"So
I
should
have
done,
had
I
not
unfortunately
happened
to
engage
Boultby
to
sup
with
me
on
his
way
home
from
the
Bible
Society
meeting
at
Nunnely.
I
promised
to
send
you
as
my
substitute;
for
which,
by
the
bye,
he
did
not
thank
me.
He
would
much
rather
have
had
me
than
you,
Peter.
Should
there
be
any
real
need
of
help
I
shall
join
you.
The
mill
bell
will
give
warning.
Meantime,
go
unless
(turning
suddenly
to
Messrs.
Sweeting
and
Donne)
unless
Davy
Sweeting
or
Joseph
Donne
prefers
going.
What
do
you
say,
gentlemen?
The
commission
is
an
honourable
one,
not
without
the
seasoning
of
a
little
real
peril;
for
the
country
is
in
a
queer
state,
as
you
all
know,
and
Moore
and
his
mill
and
his
machinery
are
held
in
sufficient
odium.
There
are
chivalric
sentiments,
there
is
high
beating
courage,
under
those
waistcoats
of
yours,
I
doubt
not.
Perhaps
I
am
too
partial
to
my
favourite
Peter.
Little
David
shall
be
the
champion,
or
spotless
Joseph.
Malone,
you
are
but
a
great
floundering
Saul
after
all,
good
only
to
lend
your
armour.
Out
with
your
firearms;
fetch
your
shillelah.
It
is
there
in
the
corner."
With
a
significant
grin
Malone
produced
his
pistols,
offering
one
to
each
of
his
brethren.
They
were
not
readily
seized
on.
With
graceful
modesty
each
gentleman
retired
a
step
from
the
presented
weapon.
"I
never
touch
them.
I
never
did
touch
anything
of
the
kind,"
said
Mr.
Donne.
"I
am
almost
a
stranger
to
Mr.
Moore,"
murmured
Sweeting.
"If
you
never
touched
a
pistol,
try
the
feel
of
it
now,
great
satrap
of
Egypt.
As
to
the
little
minstrel,
he
probably
prefers
encountering
the
Philistines
with
no
other
weapon
than
his
flute.
Get
their
hats,
Peter.
They'll
both
of
'em
go."
"No,
sir;
no,
Mr.
Helstone.
My
mother
wouldn't
like
it,"
pleaded
Sweeting.
"And
I
make
it
a
rule
never
to
get
mixed
up
in
affairs
of
the
kind,"
observed
Donne.
Helstone
smiled
sardonically;
Malone
laughed
a
horse
laugh.
He
then
replaced
his
arms,
took
his
hat
and
cudgel,
and
saying
that
"he
never
felt
more
in
tune
for
a
shindy
in
his
life,
and
that
he
wished
a
score
of
greasy
cloth
dressers
might
beat
up
Moore's
quarters
that
night,"
he
made
his
exit,
clearing
the
stairs
at
a
stride
or
two,
and
making
the
house
shake
with
the
bang
of
the
front
door
behind
him.
The
evening
was
pitch
dark:
star
and
moon
were
quenched
in
gray
rain
clouds
gray
they
would
have
been
by
day;
by
night
they
looked
sable.
Malone
was
not
a
man
given
to
close
observation
of
nature;
her
changes
passed,
for
the
most
part,
