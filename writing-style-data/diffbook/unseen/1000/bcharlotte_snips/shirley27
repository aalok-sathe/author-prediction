was
careful
not
to
put
in
practice
her
own
theory.
Much
as
she
liked
an
evening
visit
to
the
cottage,
she
never
paid
one
unasked.
Often,
indeed,
when
pressed
by
Hortense
to
come,
she
would
refuse,
because
Robert
did
not
second,
or
but
slightly
seconded
the
request.
This
morning
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever,
of
his
own
unprompted
will,
given
her
an
invitation;
and
then
he
had
spoken
so
kindly
that
in
hearing
him
she
had
received
a
sense
of
happiness
sufficient
to
keep
her
glad
for
the
whole
day.
The
morning
passed
as
usual.
Mademoiselle,
ever
breathlessly
busy,
spent
it
in
bustling
from
kitchen
to
parlour,
now
scolding
Sarah,
now
looking
over
Caroline's
exercise
or
hearing
her
repetition
lesson.
However
faultlessly
these
tasks
were
achieved,
she
never
commended:
it
was
a
maxim
with
her
that
praise
is
inconsistent
with
a
teacher's
dignity,
and
that
blame,
in
more
or
less
unqualified
measure,
is
indispensable
to
it.
She
thought
incessant
reprimand,
severe
or
slight,
quite
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
her
authority;
and
if
no
possible
error
was
to
be
found
in
the
lesson,
it
was
the
pupil's
carriage,
or
air,
or
dress,
or
mien,
which
required
correction.
The
usual
affray
took
place
about
the
dinner,
which
meal,
when
Sarah
at
last
brought
it
into
the
room,
she
almost
flung
upon
the
table,
with
a
look
that
expressed
quite
plainly,
"I
never
dished
such
stuff
i'
my
life
afore;
it's
not
fit
for
dogs."
Notwithstanding
Sarah's
scorn,
it
was
a
savoury
repast
enough.
The
soup
was
a
sort
of
puree
of
dried
peas,
which
mademoiselle
had
prepared
amidst
bitter
lamentations
that
in
this
desolate
country
of
England
no
haricot
beans
were
to
be
had.
Then
came
a
dish
of
meat
nature
unknown,
but
supposed
to
be
miscellaneous
singularly
chopped
up
with
crumbs
of
bread,
seasoned
uniquely
though
not
unpleasantly,
and
baked
in
a
mould
a
queer
but
by
no
means
unpalatable
dish.
Greens,
oddly
bruised,
formed
the
accompanying
vegetable;
and
a
pate
of
fruit,
conserved
after
a
recipe
devised
by
Madame
Gerard
Moore's
"grand'mere,"
and
from
the
taste
of
which
it
appeared
probable
that
"melasse"
had
been
substituted
for
sugar,
completed
the
dinner.
Caroline
had
no
objection
to
this
Belgian
cookery
indeed
she
rather
liked
it
for
a
change;
and
it
was
well
she
did
so,
for
had
she
evinced
any
disrelish
thereof,
such
manifestation
would
have
injured
her
in
mademoiselle's
good
graces
for
ever;
a
positive
crime
might
have
been
more
easily
pardoned
than
a
symptom
of
distaste
for
the
foreign
comestibles.
Soon
after
dinner
Caroline
coaxed
her
governess
cousin
upstairs
to
dress.
This
maneauvre
required
management.
To
have
hinted
that
the
jupon,
camisole,
and
curl
papers
were
odious
objects,
or
indeed
other
than
quite
meritorious
points,
would
have
been
a
felony.
Any
premature
attempt
to
urge
their
disappearance
was
therefore
unwise,
and
would
be
likely
to
issue
in
the
persevering
wear
of
them
during
the
whole
day.
Carefully
avoiding
rocks
and
quicksands,
however,
the
pupil,
on
pretence
of
requiring
a
change
of
scene,
contrived
to
get
the
teacher
aloft;
and,
once
in
the
bedroom,
she
persuaded
her
that
it
was
not
worth
while
returning
thither,
and
that
she
might
as
well
make
her
toilet
now;
and
while
mademoiselle
delivered
a
solemn
homily
on
her
own
surpassing
merit
in
disregarding
all
frivolities
of
fashion,
Caroline
denuded
her
of
the
camisole,
invested
her
with
a
decent
gown,
arranged
her
collar,
hair,
etc.,
and
made
her
quite
presentable.
But
Hortense
would
put
the
finishing
touches
herself,
and
these
finishing
touches
consisted
in
a
thick
handkerchief
tied
round
the
throat,
and
a
large,
servant
like
black
apron,
which
spoiled
everything.
On
no
account
would
mademoiselle
have
appeared
in
her
own
house
without
the
thick
handkerchief
and
the
voluminous
apron.
The
first
was
a
positive
matter
of
morality
it
was
quite
improper
not
to
wear
a
fichu;
the
second
was
the
ensign
of
a
good
housewife
she
appeared
to
think
that
by
means
of
it
she
somehow
effected
a
large
saving
in
her
brother's
income.
She
had,
with
her
own
hands,
made
and
presented
to
Caroline
similar
equipments;
and
the
only
serious
quarrel
they
had
ever
had,
and
which
still
left
a
soreness
in
the
elder
cousin's
soul,
had
arisen
from
the
refusal
of
the
younger
one
to
accept
of
and
profit
by
these
elegant
presents.
"I
wear
a
high
dress
and
a
collar,"
said
Caroline,
"and
I
should
feel
suffocated
with
a
handkerchief
in
addition;
and
my
short
aprons
do
quite
as
well
as
that
very
long
one.
I
would
rather
make
no
change."
Yet
Hortense,
by
dint
of
perseverance,
would
probably
have
compelled
her
to
make
a
change,
had
not
Mr.
Moore
chanced
to
overhear
a
dispute
on
the
subject,
and
decided
that
Caroline's
little
aprons
would
suffice,
and
that,
in
his
opinion,
as
she
was
still
but
a
child,
she
might
for
the
present
dispense
with
the
fichu,
especially
as
her
curls
were
long,
and
almost
touched
her
shoulders.
There
was
no
appeal
against
Robert's
opinion,
therefore
his
sister
was
compelled
to
yield;
but
she
disapproved
entirely
of
the
piquant
neatness
of
Caroline's
costume,
and
the
ladylike
grace
of
her
appearance.
Something
more
solid
and
homely
she
would
have
considered
"beaucoup
plus
convenable."
The
afternoon
was
devoted
to
sewing.
Mademoiselle,
like
most
Belgian
ladies,
was
specially
skilful
with
her
needle.
She
by
no
means
thought
it
waste
of
time
to
devote
unnumbered
hours
to
fine
embroidery,
sight
destroying
lace
work,
marvellous
netting
and
knitting,
and,
above
all,
to
most
elaborate
stocking
mending.
She
would
give
a
day
to
the
mending
of
two
holes
in
a
stocking
any
time,
and
think
her
"mission"
nobly
fulfilled
when
she
had
accomplished
it.
It
was
another
of
Caroline's
troubles
to
be
condemned
to
learn
this
foreign
style
of
darning,
which
was
done
stitch
by
stitch,
so
as
exactly
to
imitate
the
fabric
of
the
stocking
itself
a
wearifu'
process,
but
considered
by
Hortense
Gerard,
and
by
her
ancestresses
before
her
for
long
generations
