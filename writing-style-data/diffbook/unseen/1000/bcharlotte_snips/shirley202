No
longer
crushed,
and
saddened,
and
slow,
and
drooping,
she
looked
like
one
who
had
tasted
the
cordial
of
heart's
ease,
and
been
lifted
on
the
wing
of
hope.
After
tea
Hortense
went
upstairs.
She
had
not
rummaged
her
drawers
for
a
month
past,
and
the
impulse
to
perform
that
operation
was
now
become
resistless.
During
her
absence
the
talk
passed
into
Caroline's
hands.
She
took
it
up
with
ease;
she
fell
into
her
best
tone
of
conversation.
A
pleasing
facility
and
elegance
of
language
gave
fresh
charm
to
familiar
topics;
a
new
music
in
the
always
soft
voice
gently
surprised
and
pleasingly
captivated
the
listener;
unwonted
shades
and
lights
of
expression
elevated
the
young
countenance
with
character,
and
kindled
it
with
animation.
"Caroline,
you
look
as
if
you
had
heard
good
tidings,"
said
Moore,
after
earnestly
gazing
at
her
for
some
minutes.
"Do
I?"
"I
sent
for
you
this
evening
that
I
might
be
cheered;
but
you
cheer
me
more
than
I
had
calculated."
"I
am
glad
of
that.
And
I
really
cheer
you?"
"You
look
brightly,
move
buoyantly,
speak
musically."
"It
is
pleasant
to
be
here
again."
"Truly
it
is
pleasant;
I
feel
it
so.
And
to
see
health
on
your
cheek
and
hope
in
your
eye
is
pleasant,
Cary;
but
what
is
this
hope,
and
what
is
the
source
of
this
sunshine
I
perceive
about
you?"
"For
one
thing,
I
am
happy
in
mamma.
I
love
her
so
much,
and
she
loves
me.
Long
and
tenderly
she
nursed
me.
Now,
when
her
care
has
made
me
well,
I
can
occupy
myself
for
and
with
her
all
the
day.
I
say
it
is
my
turn
to
attend
to
her;
and
I
do
attend
to
her.
I
am
her
waiting
woman
as
well
as
her
child.
I
like
you
would
laugh
if
you
knew
what
pleasure
I
have
in
making
dresses
and
sewing
for
her.
She
looks
so
nice
now,
Robert;
I
will
not
let
her
be
old
fashioned.
And
then,
she
is
charming
to
talk
to
full
of
wisdom,
ripe
in
judgment,
rich
in
information,
exhaustless
in
stores
her
observant
faculties
have
quietly
amassed.
Every
day
that
I
live
with
her
I
like
her
better,
I
esteem
her
more
highly,
I
love
her
more
tenderly."
"That
for
one
thing,
then,
Cary.
You
talk
in
such
a
way
about
'mamma'
it
is
enough
to
make
one
jealous
of
the
old
lady."
"She
is
not
old,
Robert."
"Of
the
young
lady,
then."
"She
does
not
pretend
to
be
young."
"Well,
of
the
matron.
But
you
said
'mamma's'
affection
was
one
thing
that
made
you
happy;
now
for
the
other
thing."
"I
am
glad
you
are
better."
"What
besides?"
"I
am
glad
we
are
friends."
"You
and
I?"
"Yes.
I
once
thought
we
never
should
be."
"Cary,
some
day
I
mean
to
tell
you
a
thing
about
myself
that
is
not
to
my
credit,
and
consequently
will
not
please
you."
"Ah,
don't!
I
cannot
bear
to
think
ill
of
you."
"And
I
cannot
bear
that
you
should
think
better
of
me
than
I
deserve."
"Well,
but
I
half
know
your
'thing;'
indeed,
I
believe
I
know
all
about
it."
"You
do
not."
"I
believe
I
do."
"Whom
does
it
concern
besides
me?"
She
coloured;
she
hesitated;
she
was
silent.
"Speak,
Cary!
Whom
does
it
concern?"
She
tried
to
utter
a
name,
and
could
not.
"Tell
me;
there
is
none
present
but
ourselves.
Be
frank."
"But
if
I
guess
wrong?"
"I
will
forgive.
Whisper,
Cary."
He
bent
his
ear
to
her
lips.
Still
she
would
not,
or
could
not,
speak
clearly
to
the
point.
Seeing
that
Moore
waited
and
was
resolved
to
hear
something,
she
at
last
said,
"Miss
Keeldar
spent
a
day
at
the
rectory
about
a
week
since.
The
evening
came
on
very
wintry,
and
we
persuaded
her
to
stay
all
night."
"And
you
and
she
curled
your
hair
together?"
"How
do
you
know
that?"
"And
then
you
chattered,
and
she
told
you
"
"It
was
not
at
curling
hair
time,
so
you
are
not
as
wise
as
you
think;
and,
besides,
she
didn't
tell
me."
"You
slept
together
afterwards?"
"We
occupied
the
same
room
and
bed.
We
did
not
sleep
much;
we
talked
the
whole
night
through."
"I'll
be
sworn
you
did!
And
then
it
all
came
out
tant
pis.
I
would
rather
you
had
heard
it
from
myself."
"You
are
quite
wrong.
She
did
not
tell
me
what
you
suspect
she
is
not
the
person
to
proclaim
such
things;
but
yet
I
inferred
something
from
parts
of
her
discourse.
I
gathered
more
from
rumour,
and
I
made
out
the
rest
by
instinct."
"But
if
she
did
not
tell
you
that
I
wanted
to
marry
her
for
the
sake
of
her
money,
and
that
she
refused
me
indignantly
and
scornfully
(you
need
neither
start
nor
blush;
nor
yet
need
you
prick
your
trembling
fingers
with
your
needle.
That
is
the
plain
truth,
whether
you
like
it
or
not)
if
such
was
not
the
subject
of
her
august
confidences,
on
what
point
did
they
turn?
You
say
you
talked
the
whole
night
through;
what
about?"
"About
things
we
never
thoroughly
discussed
before,
intimate
friends
as
we
have
been;
but
you
hardly
expect
I
should
tell
you?"
"Yes,
yes,
Cary;
you
will
tell
me.
You
said
we
were
friends,
and
friends
should
always
confide
in
each
other."
"But
you
are
sure
you
won't
repeat
it?"
"Quite
sure."
"Not
to
Louis?"
"Not
even
to
Louis.
What
does
Louis
care
for
young
ladies'
secrets?"
"Robert,
Shirley
is
a
curious,
magnanimous
being."
"I
dare
say.
I
can
imagine
there
are
both
odd
points
and
grand
points
about
her."
"I
have
found
her
chary
in
showing
her
feelings;
but
when
they
rush
out,
river
like,
and
pass
full
and
powerful
before
you
almost
without
leave
from
her
you
gaze,
wonder;
you
admire,
and
I
think
love
her."
"You
saw
this
spectacle?"
"Yes;
at
dead
of
night,
when
all
the
house
was
silent,
and
starlight
and
