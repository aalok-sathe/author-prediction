hovering
round
her
lips,
that
at
last
she
had
hit
on
a
topic
that
pleased.
Many
a
time
had
she
heard
the
fat
"Adonis
of
fifty"
discussed
at
her
father's
breakfast
table,
and
she
now
gave
Mr.
Yorke's
comments
on
the
theme
genuine
as
uttered
by
his
Yorkshire
lips.
But,
Jessie,
I
will
write
about
you
no
more.
This
is
an
autumn
evening,
wet
and
wild.
There
is
only
one
cloud
in
the
sky,
but
it
curtains
it
from
pole
to
pole.
The
wind
cannot
rest;
it
hurries
sobbing
over
hills
of
sullen
outline,
colourless
with
twilight
and
mist.
Rain
has
beat
all
day
on
that
church
tower.
It
rises
dark
from
the
stony
enclosure
of
its
graveyard.
The
nettles,
the
long
grass,
and
the
tombs
all
drip
with
wet.
This
evening
reminds
me
too
forcibly
of
another
evening
some
years
ago
a
howling,
rainy
autumn
evening
too
when
certain
who
had
that
day
performed
a
pilgrimage
to
a
grave
new
made
in
a
heretic
cemetery
sat
near
a
wood
fire
on
the
hearth
of
a
foreign
dwelling.
They
were
merry
and
social,
but
they
each
knew
that
a
gap,
never
to
be
filled,
had
been
made
in
their
circle.
They
knew
they
had
lost
something
whose
absence
could
never
be
quite
atoned
for
so
long
as
they
lived;
and
they
knew
that
heavy
falling
rain
was
soaking
into
the
wet
earth
which
covered
their
lost
darling,
and
that
the
sad,
sighing
gale
was
mourning
above
her
buried
head.
The
fire
warmed
them;
life
and
friendship
yet
blessed
them;
but
Jessie
lay
cold,
coffined,
solitary
only
the
sod
screening
her
from
the
storm.
Mrs.
Yorke
folded
up
her
knitting,
cut
short
the
music
lesson
and
the
lecture
on
politics,
and
concluded
her
visit
to
the
cottage,
at
an
hour
early
enough
to
ensure
her
return
to
Briarmains
before
the
blush
of
sunset
should
quite
have
faded
in
heaven,
or
the
path
up
the
fields
have
become
thoroughly
moist
with
evening
dew.
The
lady
and
her
daughters
being
gone,
Caroline
felt
that
she
also
ought
to
resume
her
scarf,
kiss
her
cousin's
cheek,
and
trip
away
homeward.
If
she
lingered
much
later
dusk
would
draw
on,
and
Fanny
would
be
put
to
the
trouble
of
coming
to
fetch
her.
It
was
both
baking
and
ironing
day
at
the
rectory,
she
remembered
Fanny
would
be
busy.
Still,
she
could
not
quit
her
seat
at
the
little
parlour
window.
From
no
point
of
view
could
the
west
look
so
lovely
as
from
that
lattice
with
the
garland
of
jessamine
round
it,
whose
white
stars
and
green
leaves
seemed
now
but
gray
pencil
outlines
graceful
in
form,
but
colourless
in
tint
against
the
gold
incarnadined
of
a
summer
evening
against
the
fire
tinged
blue
of
an
August
sky
at
eight
o'clock
p.m.
Caroline
looked
at
the
wicket
gate,
beside
which
holly
oaks
spired
up
tall.
She
looked
at
the
close
hedge
of
privet
and
laurel
fencing
in
the
garden;
her
eyes
longed
to
see
something
more
than
the
shrubs
before
they
turned
from
that
limited
prospect.
They
longed
to
see
a
human
figure,
of
a
certain
mould
and
height,
pass
the
hedge
and
enter
the
gate.
A
human
figure
she
at
last
saw
nay,
two.
Frederick
Murgatroyd
went
by,
carrying
a
pail
of
water;
Joe
Scott
followed,
dangling
on
his
forefinger
the
keys
of
the
mill.
They
were
going
to
lock
up
mill
and
stables
for
the
night,
and
then
betake
themselves
home.
"So
must
I,"
thought
Caroline,
as
she
half
rose
and
sighed.
"This
is
all
folly
heart
breaking
folly,"
she
added.
"In
the
first
place,
though
I
should
stay
till
dark
there
will
be
no
arrival;
because
I
feel
in
my
heart,
Fate
has
written
it
down
in
to
day's
page
of
her
eternal
book,
that
I
am
not
to
have
the
pleasure
I
long
for.
In
the
second
place,
if
he
stepped
in
this
moment,
my
presence
here
would
be
a
chagrin
to
him,
and
the
consciousness
that
it
must
be
so
would
turn
half
my
blood
to
ice.
His
hand
would,
perhaps,
be
loose
and
chill
if
I
put
mine
into
it;
his
eye
would
be
clouded
if
I
sought
its
beam.
I
should
look
up
for
that
kindling,
something
I
have
seen
in
past
days,
when
my
face,
or
my
language,
or
my
disposition
had
at
some
happy
moment
pleased
him;
I
should
discover
only
darkness.
I
had
better
go
home."
She
took
her
bonnet
from
the
table
where
it
lay,
and
was
just
fastening
the
ribbon,
when
Hortense,
directing
her
attention
to
a
splendid
bouquet
of
flowers
in
a
glass
on
the
same
table,
mentioned
that
Miss
Keeldar
had
sent
them
that
morning
from
Fieldhead;
and
went
on
to
comment
on
the
guests
that
lady
was
at
present
entertaining,
on
the
bustling
life
she
had
lately
been
leading;
adding
divers
conjectures
that
she
did
not
very
well
like
it,
and
much
wonderment
that
a
person
who
was
so
fond
of
her
own
way
as
the
heiress
did
not
find
some
means
of
sooner
getting
rid
of
this
cortege
of
relatives.
"But
they
say
she
actually
will
not
let
Mr.
Sympson
and
his
family
go,"
she
added.
"They
wanted
much
to
return
to
the
south
last
week,
to
be
ready
for
the
reception
of
the
only
son,
who
is
expected
home
from
a
tour.
She
insists
that
her
cousin
Henry
shall
come
and
join
his
friends
here
in
Yorkshire.
I
dare
say
she
partly
does
it
to
oblige
Robert
and
myself."
"How
to
oblige
Robert
and
you?"
inquired
Caroline.
"Why,
my
child,
you
are
dull.
Don't
you
know
you
must
often
have
heard
"
"Please,
ma'am,"
said
Sarah,
opening
the
door,
"the
preserves
that
you
told
me
to
boil
in
treacle
the
congfiters,
as
you
call
them
is
all
burnt
to
the
pan."
"Les
confitures!
Elles
sont
brulees?
Ah,
quelle
negligence
coupable!
Coquine
de
cuisiniere,
fille
insupportable!"
And
mademoiselle,
hastily
taking
from
a
drawer
a
large
linen
apron,
and
