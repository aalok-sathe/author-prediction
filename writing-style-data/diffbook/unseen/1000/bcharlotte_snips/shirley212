his
wits,
he
declared
he
would
not.
Repeating
the
former
order,
I
added
a
commission
to
fetch
a
constable.
I
said,
'You
shall
go,
by
fair
means
or
foul.'
"He
threatened
prosecution;
I
cared
for
nothing.
I
had
stood
over
him
once
before,
not
quite
so
fiercely
as
now,
but
full
as
austerely.
It
was
one
night
when
burglars
attempted
the
house
at
Sympson
Grove,
and
in
his
wretched
cowardice
he
would
have
given
a
vain
alarm,
without
daring
to
offer
defence.
I
had
then
been
obliged
to
protect
his
family
and
his
abode
by
mastering
himself
and
I
had
succeeded.
I
now
remained
with
him
till
the
chaise
came.
I
marshalled
him
to
it,
he
scolding
all
the
way.
He
was
terribly
bewildered,
as
well
as
enraged.
He
would
have
resisted
me,
but
knew
not
how.
He
called
for
his
wife
and
daughters
to
come.
I
said
they
should
follow
him
as
soon
as
they
could
prepare.
The
smoke,
the
fume,
the
fret
of
his
demeanour
was
inexpressible,
but
it
was
a
fury
incapable
of
producing
a
deed.
That
man,
properly
handled,
must
ever
remain
impotent.
I
know
he
will
never
touch
me
with
the
law.
I
know
his
wife,
over
whom
he
tyrannizes
in
trifles,
guides
him
in
matters
of
importance.
I
have
long
since
earned
her
undying
mother's
gratitude
by
my
devotion
to
her
boy.
In
some
of
Henry's
ailments
I
have
nursed
him
better,
she
said,
than
any
woman
could
nurse.
She
will
never
forget
that.
She
and
her
daughters
quitted
me
to
day,
in
mute
wrath
and
consternation;
but
she
respects
me.
When
Henry
clung
to
my
neck
as
I
lifted
him
into
the
carriage
and
placed
him
by
her
side,
when
I
arranged
her
own
wrapping
to
make
her
warm,
though
she
turned
her
head
from
me,
I
saw
the
tears
start
to
her
eyes.
She
will
but
the
more
zealously
advocate
my
cause
because
she
has
left
me
in
anger.
I
am
glad
of
this
not
for
my
own
sake,
but
for
that
of
my
life
and
idol
my
Shirley."
Once
again
he
writes,
a
week
after:
"I
am
now
at
Stilbro'.
I
have
taken
up
my
temporary
abode
with
a
friend
a
professional
man,
in
whose
business
I
can
be
useful.
Every
day
I
ride
over
to
Fieldhead.
How
long
will
it
be
before
I
can
call
that
place
my
home,
and
its
mistress
mine?
I
am
not
easy,
not
tranquil;
I
am
tantalized,
sometimes
tortured.
To
see
her
now,
one
would
think
she
had
never
pressed
her
cheek
to
my
shoulder,
or
clung
to
me
with
tenderness
or
trust.
I
feel
unsafe;
she
renders
me
miserable.
I
am
shunned
when
I
visit
her;
she
withdraws
from
my
reach.
Once
this
day
I
lifted
her
face,
resolved
to
get
a
full
look
down
her
deep,
dark
eyes.
Difficult
to
describe
what
I
read
there!
Pantheress!
beautiful
forest
born!
wily,
tameless,
peerless
nature!
She
gnaws
her
chain;
I
see
the
white
teeth
working
at
the
steel!
She
has
dreams
of
her
wild
woods
and
pinings
after
virgin
freedom.
I
wish
Sympson
would
come
again,
and
oblige
her
again
to
entwine
her
arms
about
me.
I
wish
there
was
danger
she
should
lose
me,
as
there
is
risk
I
shall
lose
her.
No;
final
loss
I
do
not
fear,
but
long
delay
"It
is
now
night
midnight.
I
have
spent
the
afternoon
and
evening
at
Fieldhead.
Some
hours
ago
she
passed
me,
coming
down
the
oak
staircase
to
the
hall.
She
did
not
know
I
was
standing
in
the
twilight,
near
the
staircase
window,
looking
at
the
frost
bright
constellations.
How
closely
she
glided
against
the
banisters!
How
shyly
shone
her
large
eyes
upon
me!
How
evanescent,
fugitive,
fitful
she
looked
slim
and
swift
as
a
northern
streamer!
"I
followed
her
into
the
drawing
room.
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Caroline
Helstone
were
both
there;
she
has
summoned
them
to
bear
her
company
awhile.
In
her
white
evening
dress,
with
her
long
hair
flowing
full
and
wavy,
with
her
noiseless
step,
her
pale
cheek,
her
eye
full
of
night
and
lightning,
she
looked,
I
thought,
spirit
like
a
thing
made
of
an
element,
the
child
of
a
breeze
and
a
flame,
the
daughter
of
ray
and
raindrop
a
thing
never
to
be
overtaken,
arrested,
fixed.
I
wished
I
could
avoid
following
her
with
my
gaze
as
she
moved
here
and
there,
but
it
was
impossible.
I
talked
with
the
other
ladies
as
well
as
I
could,
but
still
I
looked
at
her.
She
was
very
silent;
I
think
she
never
spoke
to
me
not
even
when
she
offered
me
tea.
It
happened
that
she
was
called
out
a
minute
by
Mrs.
Gill.
I
passed
into
the
moonlit
hall,
with
the
design
of
getting
a
word
as
she
returned;
nor
in
this
did
I
fail.
"'Miss
Keeldar,
stay
one
instant,'
said
I,
meeting
her.
"'Why?
the
hall
is
too
cold.'
"'It
is
not
cold
for
me;
at
my
side
it
should
not
be
cold
for
you.'
"'But
I
shiver.'
"'With
fear,
I
believe.
What
makes
you
fear
me?
You
are
quiet
and
distant.
Why?'
"'I
may
well
fear
what
looks
like
a
great
dark
goblin
meeting
me
in
the
moonlight.'
"'Do
not
do
not
pass!
Stay
with
me
awhile.
Let
us
exchange
a
few
quiet
words.
It
is
three
days
since
I
spoke
to
you
alone.
Such
changes
are
cruel.'
"'I
have
no
wish
to
be
cruel,'
she
responded,
softly
enough.
Indeed
there
was
softness
in
her
whole
deportment
in
her
face,
in
her
voice;
but
there
was
also
reserve,
and
an
air
fleeting,
evanishing,
intangible.
"'You
certainly
give
me
pain,'
said
I.
'It
is
hardly
a
week
since
you
called
me
your
future
husband
and
treated
me
as
such.
Now
I
am
once
more
the
tutor
for
you.
I
am
addressed
as
Mr.
Moore
and
sir.
Your
lips
have
forgotten
Louis.'
"'No,
Louis,
no.
It
is
an
easy,
liquid
name
not
soon
forgotten.'
"'Be
cordial
to
