Sympson,
assuming
vast
courage
and
consequence
on
the
strength
of
this
symptom
of
confusion.
"It
was
an
historical
picture,
uncle,
from
several
originals."
"Several
originals!
Bless
my
heart!"
"I
have
been
in
love
several
times."
"This
is
cynical."
"With
heroes
of
many
nations."
"What
next
"
"And
philosophers."
"She
is
mad
"
"Don't
ring
the
bell,
uncle;
you
will
alarm
my
aunt."
"Your
poor
dear
aunt,
what
a
niece
has
she!"
"Once
I
loved
Socrates."
"Pooh!
no
trifling,
ma'am."
"I
admired
Themistocles,
Leonidas,
Epaminondas."
"Miss
Keeldar
"
"To
pass
over
a
few
centuries,
Washington
was
a
plain
man,
but
I
liked
him;
but
to
speak
of
the
actual
present
"
"Ah!
the
actual
present."
"To
quit
crude
schoolgirl
fancies,
and
come
to
realities."
"Realities!
That
is
the
test
to
which
you
shall
be
brought,
ma'am."
"To
avow
before
what
altar
I
now
kneel
to
reveal
the
present
idol
of
my
soul
"
"You
will
make
haste
about
it,
if
you
please.
It
is
near
luncheon
time,
and
confess
you
shall."
"Confess
I
must.
My
heart
is
full
of
the
secret.
It
must
be
spoken.
I
only
wish
you
were
Mr.
Helstone
instead
of
Mr.
Sympson;
you
would
sympathize
with
me
better."
"Madam,
it
is
a
question
of
common
sense
and
common
prudence,
not
of
sympathy
and
sentiment,
and
so
on.
Did
you
say
it
was
Mr.
Helstone?"
"Not
precisely,
but
as
near
as
may
be;
they
are
rather
alike."
"I
will
know
the
name;
I
will
have
particulars."
"They
positively
are
rather
alike.
Their
very
faces
are
not
dissimilar
a
pair
of
human
falcons
and
dry,
direct,
decided
both.
But
my
hero
is
the
mightier
of
the
two.
His
mind
has
the
clearness
of
the
deep
sea,
the
patience
of
its
rocks,
the
force
of
its
billows."
"Rant
and
fustian!"
"I
dare
say
he
can
be
harsh
as
a
saw
edge
and
gruff
as
a
hungry
raven."
"Miss
Keeldar,
does
the
person
reside
in
Briarfield?
Answer
me
that."
"Uncle,
I
am
going
to
tell
you;
his
name
is
trembling
on
my
tongue."
"Speak,
girl!"
"That
was
well
said,
uncle.
'Speak,
girl!'
It
is
quite
tragic.
England
has
howled
savagely
against
this
man,
uncle,
and
she
will
one
day
roar
exultingly
over
him.
He
has
been
unscared
by
the
howl,
and
he
will
be
unelated
by
the
shout."
"I
said
she
was
mad.
She
is."
"This
country
will
change
and
change
again
in
her
demeanour
to
him;
he
will
never
change
in
his
duty
to
her.
Come,
cease
to
chafe,
uncle,
I'll
tell
you
his
name."
"You
shall
tell
me,
or
"
"Listen!
Arthur
Wellesley,
Lord
Wellington."
Mr.
Sympson
rose
up
furious.
He
bounced
out
of
the
room,
but
immediately
bounced
back
again,
shut
the
door,
and
resumed
his
seat.
"Ma'am,
you
shall
tell
me
this.
Will
your
principles
permit
you
to
marry
a
man
without
money
a
man
below
you?"
"Never
a
man
below
me."
(In
a
high
voice.)
"Will
you,
Miss
Keeldar,
marry
a
poor
man?"
"What
right
have
you,
Mr.
Sympson,
to
ask
me?"
"I
insist
upon
knowing."
"You
don't
go
the
way
to
know."
"My
family
respectability
shall
not
be
compromised."
"A
good
resolution;
keep
it."
"Madam,
it
is
you
who
shall
keep
it."
"Impossible,
sir,
since
I
form
no
part
of
your
family."
"Do
you
disown
us?"
"I
disdain
your
dictatorship."
"Whom
will
you
marry,
Miss
Keeldar?"
"Not
Mr.
Sam
Wynne,
because
I
scorn
him;
not
Sir
Philip
Nunnely,
because
I
only
esteem
him."
"Whom
have
you
in
your
eye?"
"Four
rejected
candidates."
"Such
obstinacy
could
not
be
unless
you
were
under
improper
influence."
"What
do
you
mean?
There
are
certain
phrases
potent
to
make
my
blood
boil.
Improper
influence!
What
old
woman's
cackle
is
that?"
"Are
you
a
young
lady?"
"I
am
a
thousand
times
better:
I
am
an
honest
woman,
and
as
such
I
will
be
treated."
"Do
you
know"
(leaning
mysteriously
forward,
and
speaking
with
ghastly
solemnity)
"do
you
know
the
whole
neighbourhood
teems
with
rumours
respecting
you
and
a
bankrupt
tenant
of
yours,
the
foreigner
Moore?"
"Does
it?"
"It
does.
Your
name
is
in
every
mouth."
"It
honours
the
lips
it
crosses,
and
I
wish
to
the
gods
it
may
purify
them."
"Is
it
that
person
who
has
power
to
influence
you?"
"Beyond
any
whose
cause
you
have
advocated."
"Is
it
he
you
will
marry?"
"He
is
handsome,
and
manly,
and
commanding."
"You
declare
it
to
my
face!
The
Flemish
knave!
the
low
trader!"
"He
is
talented,
and
venturous,
and
resolute.
Prince
is
on
his
brow,
and
ruler
in
his
bearing."
"She
glories
in
it!
She
conceals
nothing!
No
shame,
no
fear!"
"When
we
speak
the
name
of
Moore,
shame
should
be
forgotten
and
fear
discarded.
The
Moores
know
only
honour
and
courage."
"I
say
she
is
mad."
"You
have
taunted
me
till
my
blood
is
up;
you
have
worried
me
till
I
turn
again."
"That
Moore
is
the
brother
of
my
son's
tutor.
Would
you
let
the
usher
call
you
sister?"
Bright
and
broad
shone
Shirley's
eye
as
she
fixed
it
on
her
questioner
now.
"No,
no;
not
for
a
province
of
possession,
not
for
a
century
of
life."
"You
cannot
separate
the
husband
from
his
family."
"What
then?"
"Mr.
Louis
Moore's
sister
you
will
be."
"Mr.
Sympson,
I
am
sick
at
heart
with
all
this
weak
trash;
I
will
bear
no
more.
Your
thoughts
are
not
my
thoughts,
your
aims
are
not
my
aims,
your
gods
are
not
my
gods.
We
do
not
view
things
in
the
same
light;
we
do
not
measure
them
by
the
same
standard;
we
hardly
speak
in
the
same
tongue.
Let
us
part."
"It
is
not,"
she
resumed,
much
excited
"it
is
not
that
I
hate
you;
you
are
a
good
sort
of
man.
Perhaps
you
mean
well
in
your
way.
But
we
cannot
suit;
we
are
ever
at
variance.
You
annoy
me
with
small
meddling,
with
petty
tyranny;
you
exasperate
my
temper,
and
make
and
keep
me
passionate.
As
to
your
small
maxims,
your
