for.
But
never
again
say
I
am
too
kind.
You
pierce
my
heart,
child!"
"But,
my
dear
madam
this
generosity
I
have
no
claim
"
"Hush!
you
must
not
talk
about
it.
There
are
some
things
we
cannot
bear
to
hear.
Oh!
it
is
late
to
begin,
but
I
may
yet
live
a
few
years.
I
can
never
wipe
out
the
past,
but
perhaps
a
brief
space
in
the
future
may
yet
be
mine."
Mrs.
Pryor
seemed
deeply
agitated.
Large
tears
trembled
in
her
eyes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks.
Caroline
kissed
her,
in
her
gentle,
caressing
way,
saying
softly,
"I
love
you
dearly.
Don't
cry."
But
the
lady's
whole
frame
seemed
shaken.
She
sat
down,
bent
her
head
to
her
knee,
and
wept
aloud.
Nothing
could
console
her
till
the
inward
storm
had
had
its
way.
At
last
the
agony
subsided
of
itself.
"Poor
thing!"
she
murmured,
returning
Caroline's
kiss,
"poor
lonely
lamb!
But
come,"
she
added
abruptly
"come;
we
must
go
home."
For
a
short
distance
Mrs.
Pryor
walked
very
fast.
By
degrees,
however,
she
calmed
down
to
her
wonted
manner,
fell
into
her
usual
characteristic
pace
a
peculiar
one,
like
all
her
movements
and
by
the
time
they
reached
Fieldhead
she
had
re
entered
into
herself.
The
outside
was,
as
usual,
still
and
shy.
Only
half
of
Moore's
activity
and
resolution
had
been
seen
in
his
defence
of
the
mill;
he
showed
the
other
half
(and
a
terrible
half
it
was)
in
the
indefatigable,
the
relentless
assiduity
with
which
he
pursued
the
leaders
of
the
riot.
The
mob,
the
mere
followers,
he
let
alone.
Perhaps
an
innate
sense
of
justice
told
him
that
men
misled
by
false
counsel
and
goaded
by
privations
are
not
fit
objects
of
vengeance,
and
that
he
who
would
visit
an
even
violent
act
on
the
bent
head
of
suffering
is
a
tyrant,
not
a
judge.
At
all
events,
though
he
knew
many
of
the
number,
having
recognized
them
during
the
latter
part
of
the
attack
when
day
began
to
dawn,
he
let
them
daily
pass
him
on
street
and
road
without
notice
or
threat.
The
leaders
he
did
not
know.
They
were
strangers
emissaries
from
the
large
towns.
Most
of
these
were
not
members
of
the
operative
class.
They
were
chiefly
"down
draughts,"
bankrupts,
men
always
in
debt
and
often
in
drink,
men
who
had
nothing
to
lose,
and
much,
in
the
way
of
character,
cash,
and
cleanliness,
to
gain.
These
persons
Moore
hunted
like
any
sleuth
hound,
and
well
he
liked
the
occupation.
Its
excitement
was
of
a
kind
pleasant
to
his
nature.
He
liked
it
better
than
making
cloth.
His
horse
must
have
hated
these
times,
for
it
was
ridden
both
hard
and
often.
He
almost
lived
on
the
road,
and
the
fresh
air
was
as
welcome
to
his
lungs
as
the
policeman's
quest
to
his
mood;
he
preferred
it
to
the
steam
of
dye
houses.
The
magistrates
of
the
district
must
have
dreaded
him.
They
were
slow,
timid
men;
he
liked
both
to
frighten
and
to
rouse
them.
He
liked
to
force
them
to
betray
a
certain
fear,
which
made
them
alike
falter
in
resolve
and
recoil
in
action
the
fear,
simply,
of
assassination.
This,
indeed,
was
the
dread
which
had
hitherto
hampered
every
manufacturer
and
almost
every
public
man
in
the
district.
Helstone
alone
had
ever
repelled
it.
The
old
Cossack
knew
well
he
might
be
shot.
He
knew
there
was
risk;
but
such
death
had
for
his
nerves
no
terrors.
It
would
have
been
his
chosen,
might
he
have
had
a
choice.
Moore
likewise
knew
his
danger.
The
result
was
an
unquenchable
scorn
of
the
quarter
whence
such
danger
was
to
be
apprehended.
The
consciousness
that
he
hunted
assassins
was
the
spur
in
his
high
mettled
temper's
flank.
As
for
fear,
he
was
too
proud,
too
hard
natured
(if
you
will),
too
phlegmatic
a
man
to
fear.
Many
a
time
he
rode
belated
over
the
moors,
moonlit
or
moonless
as
the
case
might
be,
with
feelings
far
more
elate,
faculties
far
better
refreshed,
than
when
safety
and
stagnation
environed
him
in
the
counting
house.
Four
was
the
number
of
the
leaders
to
be
accounted
for.
Two,
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight,
were
brought
to
bay
near
Stilbro';
the
remaining
two
it
was
necessary
to
seek
farther
off.
Their
haunts
were
supposed
to
lie
near
Birmingham.
Meantime
the
clothier
did
not
neglect
his
battered
mill.
Its
reparation
was
esteemed
a
light
task,
carpenters'
and
glaziers'
work
alone
being
needed.
The
rioters
not
having
succeeded
in
effecting
an
entrance,
his
grim
metal
darlings
the
machines
had
escaped
damage.
Whether
during
this
busy
life
whether
while
stern
justice
and
exacting
business
claimed
his
energies
and
harassed
his
thoughts
he
now
and
then
gave
one
moment,
dedicated
one
effort,
to
keep
alive
gentler
fires
than
those
which
smoulder
in
the
fane
of
Nemesis,
it
was
not
easy
to
discover.
He
seldom
went
near
Fieldhead;
if
he
did,
his
visits
were
brief.
If
he
called
at
the
rectory,
it
was
only
to
hold
conferences
with
the
rector
in
his
study.
He
maintained
his
rigid
course
very
steadily.
Meantime
the
history
of
the
year
continued
troubled.
There
was
no
lull
in
the
tempest
of
war;
her
long
hurricane
still
swept
the
Continent.
There
was
not
the
faintest
sign
of
serene
weather,
no
opening
amid
"the
clouds
of
battle
dust
and
smoke,"
no
fall
of
pure
dews
genial
to
the
olive,
no
cessation
of
the
red
rain
which
nourishes
the
baleful
and
glorious
laurel.
Meantime,
Ruin
had
her
sappers
and
miners
at
work
under
Moore's
feet,
and
whether
he
rode
or
walked,
whether
he
only
crossed
his
counting
house
hearth
or
galloped
over
sullen
Rushedge,
he
was
aware
of
a
hollow
echo,
and
felt
the
ground
shake
to
his
tread.
While
the
summer
thus
passed
with
Moore,
how
did
it
lapse
with
Shirley
and
Caroline?
Let
us
first
visit
the
heiress.
How
does
she
look?
Like
a
love
lorn
maiden,
pale
and
pining
