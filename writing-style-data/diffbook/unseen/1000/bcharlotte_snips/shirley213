Louis,
then;
approach
him
let
him
approach.'
"'I
am
cordial,'
said
she,
hovering
aloof
like
a
white
shadow.
"'Your
voice
is
very
sweet
and
very
low,'
I
answered,
quietly
advancing.
'You
seem
subdued,
but
still
startled.'
"'No
quite
calm,
and
afraid
of
nothing,'
she
assured
me.
"'Of
nothing
but
your
votary.'
"I
bent
a
knee
to
the
flags
at
her
feet.
"'You
see
I
am
in
a
new
world,
Mr.
Moore.
I
don't
know
myself;
I
don't
know
you.
But
rise.
When
you
do
so
I
feel
troubled
and
disturbed.'
"I
obeyed.
It
would
not
have
suited
me
to
retain
that
attitude
long.
I
courted
serenity
and
confidence
for
her,
and
not
vainly.
She
trusted
and
clung
to
me
again.
"'Now,
Shirley,'
I
said,
'you
can
conceive
I
am
far
from
happy
in
my
present
uncertain,
unsettled
state.'
"'Oh
yes,
you
are
happy!'
she
cried
hastily.
'You
don't
know
how
happy
you
are.
Any
change
will
be
for
the
worse.'
"'Happy
or
not,
I
cannot
bear
to
go
on
so
much
longer.
You
are
too
generous
to
require
it.'
"'Be
reasonable,
Louis;
be
patient!
I
like
you
because
you
are
patient.'
"'Like
me
no
longer,
then;
love
me
instead.
Fix
our
marriage
day;
think
of
it
to
night,
and
decide.'
"She
breathed
a
murmur,
inarticulate
yet
expressive;
darted,
or
melted,
from
my
arms
and
I
lost
her."
Yes,
reader,
we
must
settle
accounts
now.
I
have
only
briefly
to
narrate
the
final
fates
of
some
of
the
personages
whose
acquaintance
we
have
made
in
this
narrative,
and
then
you
and
I
must
shake
hands,
and
for
the
present
separate.
Let
us
turn
to
the
curates
to
the
much
loved,
though
long
neglected.
Come
forward,
modest
merit!
Malone,
I
see,
promptly
answers
the
invocation.
He
knows
his
own
description
when
he
hears
it.
No,
Peter
Augustus;
we
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
you.
It
won't
do.
Impossible
to
trust
ourselves
with
the
touching
tale
of
your
deeds
and
destinies.
Are
you
not
aware,
Peter,
that
a
discriminating
public
has
its
crotchets;
that
the
unvarnished
truth
does
not
answer;
that
plain
facts
will
not
digest?
Do
you
not
know
that
the
squeak
of
the
real
pig
is
no
more
relished
now
than
it
was
in
days
of
yore?
Were
I
to
give
the
catastrophe
of
your
life
and
conversation,
the
public
would
sweep
off
in
shrieking
hysterics,
and
there
would
be
a
wild
cry
for
sal
volatile
and
burnt
feathers.
"Impossible!"
would
be
pronounced
here;
"untrue!"
would
be
responded
there;
"inartistic!"
would
be
solemnly
decided.
Note
well.
Whenever
you
present
the
actual,
simple
truth,
it
is,
somehow,
always
denounced
as
a
lie
they
disown
it,
cast
it
off,
throw
it
on
the
parish;
whereas
the
product
of
your
own
imagination,
the
mere
figment,
the
sheer
fiction,
is
adopted,
petted,
termed
pretty,
proper,
sweetly
natural
the
little,
spurious
wretch
gets
all
the
comfits,
the
honest,
lawful
bantling
all
the
cuffs.
Such
is
the
way
of
the
world,
Peter;
and
as
you
are
the
legitimate
urchin,
rude,
unwashed,
and
naughty,
you
must
stand
down.
Make
way
for
Mr.
Sweeting.
Here
he
comes,
with
his
lady
on
his
arm
the
most
splendid
and
the
weightiest
woman
in
Yorkshire
Mrs.
Sweeting,
formerly
Miss
Dora
Sykes.
They
were
married
under
the
happiest
auspices,
Mr.
Sweeting
having
been
just
inducted
to
a
comfortable
living,
and
Mr.
Sykes
being
in
circumstances
to
give
Dora
a
handsome
portion.
They
lived
long
and
happily
together,
beloved
by
their
parishioners
and
by
a
numerous
circle
of
friends.
There!
I
think
the
varnish
has
been
put
on
very
nicely.
Advance,
Mr.
Donne.
This
gentleman
turned
out
admirably
far
better
than
either
you
or
I
could
possibly
have
expected,
reader.
He,
too,
married
a
most
sensible,
quiet,
lady
like
little
woman.
The
match
was
the
making
of
him.
He
became
an
exemplary
domestic
character,
and
a
truly
active
parish
priest
(as
a
pastor
he,
to
his
dying
day,
conscientiously
refused
to
act).
The
outside
of
the
cup
and
platter
he
burnished
up
with
the
best
polishing
powder;
the
furniture
of
the
altar
and
temple
he
looked
after
with
the
zeal
of
an
upholsterer,
the
care
of
a
cabinet
maker.
His
little
school,
his
little
church,
his
little
parsonage,
all
owed
their
erection
to
him;
and
they
did
him
credit.
Each
was
a
model
in
its
way.
If
uniformity
and
taste
in
architecture
had
been
the
same
thing
as
consistency
and
earnestness
in
religion,
what
a
shepherd
of
a
Christian
flock
Mr.
Donne
would
have
made!
There
was
one
art
in
the
mastery
of
which
nothing
mortal
ever
surpassed
Mr.
Donne:
it
was
that
of
begging.
By
his
own
unassisted
efforts
he
begged
all
the
money
for
all
his
erections.
In
this
matter
he
had
a
grasp
of
plan,
a
scope
of
action
quite
unique.
He
begged
of
high
and
low
of
the
shoeless
cottage
brat
and
the
coroneted
duke.
He
sent
out
begging
letters
far
and
wide
to
old
Queen
Charlotte,
to
the
princesses
her
daughters,
to
her
sons
the
royal
dukes,
to
the
Prince
Regent,
to
Lord
Castlereagh,
to
every
member
of
the
ministry
then
in
office;
and,
what
is
more
remarkable,
he
screwed
something
out
of
every
one
of
these
personages.
It
is
on
record
that
he
got
five
pounds
from
the
close
fisted
old
lady
Queen
Charlotte,
and
two
guineas
from
the
royal
profligate
her
eldest
son.
When
Mr.
Donne
set
out
on
begging
expeditions,
he
armed
himself
in
a
complete
suit
of
brazen
mail.
That
you
had
given
a
hundred
pounds
yesterday
was
with
him
no
reason
why
you
should
not
give
two
hundred
to
day.
He
would
tell
you
so
to
your
face,
and,
ten
to
one,
get
the
money
out
of
you.
People
gave
to
get
rid
of
him.
After
all,
he
did
some
good
with
the
cash.
He
was
useful
in
his
day
and
generation.
Perhaps
I
ought
to
remark
that
on
the
premature
and
sudden
vanishing
of
Mr.
Malone
from
the
stage
of
Briarfield
parish
