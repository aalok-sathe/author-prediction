sort
of
tacit
antipathy;
an
old
servant,
who
had
lived
with
Mrs.
James
Helstone
for
a
short
time
after
her
marriage,
whenever
she
referred
to
her
former
mistress,
spoke
with
chilling
reserve
sometimes
she
called
her
"queer,"
sometimes
she
said
she
did
not
understand
her.
These
expressions
were
ice
to
the
daughter's
heart;
they
suggested
the
conclusion
that
it
was
perhaps
better
never
to
know
her
parent
than
to
know
her
and
not
like
her.
But
one
project
could
she
frame
whose
execution
seemed
likely
to
bring
her
a
hope
of
relief:
it
was
to
take
a
situation,
to
be
a
governess;
she
could
do
nothing
else.
A
little
incident
brought
her
to
the
point,
when
she
found
courage
to
break
her
design
to
her
uncle.
Her
long
and
late
walks
lay
always,
as
has
been
said,
on
lonely
roads;
but
in
whatever
direction
she
had
rambled
whether
along
the
drear
skirts
of
Stilbro'
Moor
or
over
the
sunny
stretch
of
Nunnely
Common
her
homeward
path
was
still
so
contrived
as
to
lead
her
near
the
Hollow.
She
rarely
descended
the
den,
but
she
visited
its
brink
at
twilight
almost
as
regularly
as
the
stars
rose
over
the
hillcrests.
Her
resting
place
was
at
a
certain
stile
under
a
certain
old
thorn.
Thence
she
could
look
down
on
the
cottage,
the
mill,
the
dewy
garden
ground,
the
still,
deep
dam;
thence
was
visible
the
well
known
counting
house
window,
from
whose
panes
at
a
fixed
hour
shot,
suddenly
bright,
the
ray
of
the
well
known
lamp.
Her
errand
was
to
watch
for
this
ray,
her
reward
to
catch
it,
sometimes
sparkling
bright
in
clear
air,
sometimes
shimmering
dim
through
mist,
and
anon
flashing
broken
between
slant
lines
of
rain
for
she
came
in
all
weathers.
There
were
nights
when
it
failed
to
appear.
She
knew
then
that
Robert
was
from
home,
and
went
away
doubly
sad;
whereas
its
kindling
rendered
her
elate,
as
though
she
saw
in
it
the
promise
of
some
indefinite
hope.
If,
while
she
gazed,
a
shadow
bent
between
the
light
and
lattice,
her
heart
leaped.
That
eclipse
was
Robert;
she
had
seen
him.
She
would
return
home
comforted,
carrying
in
her
mind
a
clearer
vision
of
his
aspect,
a
distincter
recollection
of
his
voice,
his
smile,
his
bearing;
and
blent
with
these
impressions
was
often
a
sweet
persuasion
that,
if
she
could
get
near
him,
his
heart
might
welcome
her
presence
yet,
that
at
this
moment
he
might
be
willing
to
extend
his
hand
and
draw
her
to
him,
and
shelter
her
at
his
side
as
he
used
to
do.
That
night,
though
she
might
weep
as
usual,
she
would
fancy
her
tears
less
scalding;
the
pillow
they
watered
seemed
a
little
softer;
the
temples
pressed
to
that
pillow
ached
less.
The
shortest
path
from
the
Hollow
to
the
rectory
wound
near
a
certain
mansion,
the
same
under
whose
lone
walls
Malone
passed
on
that
night
journey
mentioned
in
an
early
chapter
of
this
work
the
old
and
tenantless
dwelling
yclept
Fieldhead.
Tenantless
by
the
proprietor
it
had
been
for
ten
years,
but
it
was
no
ruin.
Mr.
Yorke
had
seen
it
kept
in
good
repair,
and
an
old
gardener
and
his
wife
had
lived
in
it,
cultivated
the
grounds,
and
maintained
the
house
in
habitable
condition.
If
Fieldhead
had
few
other
merits
as
a
building,
it
might
at
least
be
termed
picturesque.
Its
regular
architecture,
and
the
gray
and
mossy
colouring
communicated
by
time,
gave
it
a
just
claim
to
this
epithet.
The
old
latticed
windows,
the
stone
porch,
the
walls,
the
roof,
the
chimney
stacks,
were
rich
in
crayon
touches
and
sepia
lights
and
shades.
The
trees
behind
were
fine,
bold,
and
spreading;
the
cedar
on
the
lawn
in
front
was
grand;
and
the
granite
urns
on
the
garden
wall,
the
fretted
arch
of
the
gateway,
were,
for
an
artist,
as
the
very
desire
of
the
eye.
One
mild
May
evening
Caroline,
passing
near
about
moonrise,
and
feeling,
though
weary,
unwilling
yet
to
go
home,
where
there
was
only
the
bed
of
thorns
and
the
night
of
grief
to
anticipate,
sat
down
on
the
mossy
ground
near
the
gate,
and
gazed
through
towards
cedar
and
mansion.
It
was
a
still
night
calm,
dewy,
cloudless;
the
gables,
turned
to
the
west,
reflected
the
clear
amber
of
the
horizon
they
faced;
the
oaks
behind
were
black;
the
cedar
was
blacker.
Under
its
dense,
raven
boughs
a
glimpse
of
sky
opened
gravely
blue.
It
was
full
of
the
moon,
which
looked
solemnly
and
mildly
down
on
Caroline
from
beneath
that
sombre
canopy.
She
felt
this
night
and
prospect
mournfully
lovely.
She
wished
she
could
be
happy;
she
wished
she
could
know
inward
peace;
she
wondered
Providence
had
no
pity
on
her,
and
would
not
help
or
console
her.
Recollections
of
happy
trysts
of
lovers,
commemorated
in
old
ballads,
returned
on
her
mind;
she
thought
such
tryst
in
such
scene
would
be
blissful.
Where
now
was
Robert?
she
asked.
Not
at
the
Hollow;
she
had
watched
for
his
lamp
long,
and
had
not
seen
it.
She
questioned
within
herself
whether
she
and
Moore
were
ever
destined
to
meet
and
speak
again.
Suddenly
the
door
within
the
stone
porch
of
the
hall
opened,
and
two
men
came
out
one
elderly
and
white
headed,
the
other
young,
dark
haired,
and
tall.
They
passed
across
the
lawn,
out
through
a
portal
in
the
garden
wall.
Caroline
saw
them
cross
the
road,
pass
the
stile,
descend
the
fields;
she
saw
them
disappear.
Robert
Moore
had
passed
before
her
with
his
friend
Mr.
Yorke.
Neither
had
seen
her.
The
apparition
had
been
transient
scarce
seen
ere
gone;
but
its
electric
passage
left
her
veins
kindled,
her
soul
insurgent.
It
found
her
despairing,
it
left
her
desperate
two
different
states.
"Oh,
had
he
but
been
alone!
had
he
but
seen
me!"
was
her
cry.
"He
would
have
said
something.
He
would
have
given
me
his
hand.
He
does,
he
must,
love
me
a
little.
