felt
annoyed
had
he
fondled
a
kitten
in
her
presence.
The
boys
were
standing
about
the
chaise
as
Moore
entered
it;
but
for
them
he
had
no
farewell.
To
Mr.
Yorke
he
only
said,
"You
have
a
good
riddance
of
me.
That
was
an
unlucky
shot
for
you,
Yorke;
it
turned
Briarmains
into
an
hospital.
Come
and
see
me
at
the
cottage
soon."
He
drew
up
the
glass;
the
chaise
rolled
away.
In
half
an
hour
he
alighted
at
his
own
garden
wicket.
Having
paid
the
driver
and
dismissed
the
vehicle,
he
leaned
on
that
wicket
an
instant,
at
once
to
rest
and
to
muse.
"Six
months
ago
I
passed
out
at
this
gate,"
said
he,
"a
proud,
angry,
disappointed
man.
I
come
back
sadder
and
wiser;
weakly
enough,
but
not
worried.
A
cold,
gray,
yet
quiet
world
lies
round
a
world
where,
if
I
hope
little,
I
fear
nothing.
All
slavish
terrors
of
embarrassment
have
left
me.
Let
the
worst
come,
I
can
work,
as
Joe
Scott
does,
for
an
honourable
living;
in
such
doom
I
yet
see
some
hardship
but
no
degradation.
Formerly,
pecuniary
ruin
was
equivalent
in
my
eyes
to
personal
dishonour.
It
is
not
so
now;
I
know
the
difference.
Ruin
is
an
evil,
but
one
for
which
I
am
prepared;
the
day
of
whose
coming
I
know,
for
I
have
calculated.
I
can
yet
put
it
off
six
months
not
an
hour
longer.
If
things
by
that
time
alter,
which
is
not
probable;
if
fetters,
which
now
seem
indissoluble,
should
be
loosened
from
our
trade
(of
all
things
the
most
unlikely
to
happen),
I
might
conquer
in
this
long
struggle
yet
I
might
good
God!
what
might
I
not
do?
But
the
thought
is
a
brief
madness;
let
me
see
things
with
sane
eyes.
Ruin
will
come,
lay
her
axe
to
my
fortune's
roots,
and
hew
them
down.
I
shall
snatch
a
sapling,
I
shall
cross
the
sea,
and
plant
it
in
American
woods.
Louis
will
go
with
me.
Will
none
but
Louis
go?
I
cannot
tell
I
have
no
right
to
ask."
He
entered
the
house.
It
was
afternoon,
twilight
yet
out
of
doors
starless
and
moonless
twilight;
for
though
keenly
freezing
with
a
dry,
black
frost,
heaven
wore
a
mask
of
clouds
congealed
and
fast
locked.
The
mill
dam
too
was
frozen.
The
Hollow
was
very
still.
Indoors
it
was
already
dark.
Sarah
had
lit
a
good
fire
in
the
parlour;
she
was
preparing
tea
in
the
kitchen.
"Hortense,"
said
Moore,
as
his
sister
bustled
up
to
help
him
off
with
his
cloak,
"I
am
pleased
to
come
home."
Hortense
did
not
feel
the
peculiar
novelty
of
this
expression
coming
from
her
brother,
who
had
never
before
called
the
cottage
his
home,
and
to
whom
its
narrow
limits
had
always
heretofore
seemed
rather
restrictive
than
protective.
Still,
whatever
contributed
to
his
happiness
pleased
her,
and
she
expressed
herself
to
that
effect.
He
sat
down,
but
soon
rose
again.
He
went
to
the
window;
he
came
back
to
the
fire.
"Hortense!"
"Mon
frere?"
"This
little
parlour
looks
very
clean
and
pleasant
unusually
bright,
somehow."
"It
is
true,
brother;
I
have
had
the
whole
house
thoroughly
and
scrupulously
cleaned
in
your
absence."
"Sister,
I
think
on
this
first
day
of
your
return
home
you
ought
to
have
a
friend
or
so
to
tea,
if
it
were
only
to
see
how
fresh
and
spruce
you
have
made
the
little
place."
"True,
brother.
If
it
were
not
late
I
might
send
for
Miss
Mann."
"So
you
might;
but
it
really
is
too
late
to
disturb
that
good
lady,
and
the
evening
is
much
too
cold
for
her
to
come
out."
"How
thoughtful
in
you,
dear
Gerard!
We
must
put
it
off
till
another
day."
"I
want
some
one
to
day,
dear
sister
some
quiet
guest,
who
would
tire
neither
of
us."
"Miss
Ainley?"
"An
excellent
person,
they
say;
but
she
lives
too
far
off.
Tell
Harry
Scott
to
step
up
to
the
rectory
with
a
request
from
you
that
Caroline
Helstone
should
come
and
spend
the
evening
with
you."
"Would
it
not
be
better
to
morrow,
dear
brother?"
"I
should
like
her
to
see
the
place
as
it
is
just
now;
its
brilliant
cleanliness
and
perfect
neatness
are
so
much
to
your
credit."
"It
might
benefit
her
in
the
way
of
example."
"It
might
and
must;
she
ought
to
come."
He
went
into
the
kitchen.
"Sarah,
delay
tea
half
an
hour."
He
then
commissioned
her
to
dispatch
Harry
Scott
to
the
rectory,
giving
her
a
twisted
note
hastily
scribbled
in
pencil
by
himself,
and
addressed
"Miss
Helstone."
Scarcely
had
Sarah
time
to
get
impatient
under
the
fear
of
damage
to
her
toast
already
prepared
when
the
messenger
returned,
and
with
him
the
invited
guest.
She
entered
through
the
kitchen,
quietly
tripped
up
Sarah's
stairs
to
take
off
her
bonnet
and
furs,
and
came
down
as
quietly,
with
her
beautiful
curls
nicely
smoothed,
her
graceful
merino
dress
and
delicate
collar
all
trim
and
spotless,
her
gay
little
work
bag
in
her
hand.
She
lingered
to
exchange
a
few
kindly
words
with
Sarah,
and
to
look
at
the
new
tortoise
shell
kitten
basking
on
the
kitchen
hearth,
and
to
speak
to
the
canary
bird,
which
a
sudden
blaze
from
the
fire
had
startled
on
its
perch;
and
then
she
betook
herself
to
the
parlour.
The
gentle
salutation,
the
friendly
welcome,
were
interchanged
in
such
tranquil
sort
as
befitted
cousins
meeting;
a
sense
of
pleasure,
subtle
and
quiet
as
a
perfume,
diffused
itself
through
the
room;
the
newly
kindled
lamp
burnt
up
bright;
the
tray
and
the
singing
urn
were
brought
in.
"I
am
pleased
to
come
home,"
repeated
Mr.
Moore.
They
assembled
round
the
table.
Hortense
chiefly
talked.
She
congratulated
Caroline
on
the
evident
improvement
in
her
health.
Her
colour
and
her
plump
cheeks
were
returning,
she
remarked.
It
was
true.
There
was
an
obvious
change
in
Miss
Helstone.
All
about
her
seemed
elastic;
depression,
fear,
forlornness,
were
withdrawn.
