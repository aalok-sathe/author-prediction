unnoticed
by
him.
He
could
walk
miles
on
the
most
varying
April
day
and
never
see
the
beautiful
dallying
of
earth
and
heaven
never
mark
when
a
sunbeam
kissed
the
hill
tops,
making
them
smile
clear
in
green
light,
or
when
a
shower
wept
over
them,
hiding
their
crests
with
the
low
hanging,
dishevelled
tresses
of
a
cloud.
He
did
not,
therefore,
care
to
contrast
the
sky
as
it
now
appeared
a
muffled,
streaming
vault,
all
black,
save
where,
towards
the
east,
the
furnaces
of
Stilbro'
ironworks
threw
a
tremulous
lurid
shimmer
on
the
horizon
with
the
same
sky
on
an
unclouded
frosty
night.
He
did
not
trouble
himself
to
ask
where
the
constellations
and
the
planets
were
gone,
or
to
regret
the
"black
blue"
serenity
of
the
air
ocean
which
those
white
islets
stud,
and
which
another
ocean,
of
heavier
and
denser
element,
now
rolled
below
and
concealed.
He
just
doggedly
pursued
his
way,
leaning
a
little
forward
as
he
walked,
and
wearing
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head,
as
his
Irish
manner
was.
"Tramp,
tramp,"
he
went
along
the
causeway,
where
the
road
boasted
the
privilege
of
such
an
accommodation;
"splash,
splash,"
through
the
mire
filled
cart
ruts,
where
the
flags
were
exchanged
for
soft
mud.
He
looked
but
for
certain
landmarks
the
spire
of
Briarfield
Church;
farther
on,
the
lights
of
Redhouse.
This
was
an
inn;
and
when
he
reached
it,
the
glow
of
a
fire
through
a
half
curtained
window,
a
vision
of
glasses
on
a
round
table,
and
of
revellers
on
an
oaken
settle,
had
nearly
drawn
aside
the
curate
from
his
course.
He
thought
longingly
of
a
tumbler
of
whisky
and
water.
In
a
strange
place
he
would
instantly
have
realized
the
dream;
but
the
company
assembled
in
that
kitchen
were
Mr.
Helstone's
own
parishioners;
they
all
knew
him.
He
sighed,
and
passed
on.
The
highroad
was
now
to
be
quitted,
as
the
remaining
distance
to
Hollow's
Mill
might
be
considerably
reduced
by
a
short
cut
across
fields.
These
fields
were
level
and
monotonous.
Malone
took
a
direct
course
through
them,
jumping
hedge
and
wall.
He
passed
but
one
building
here,
and
that
seemed
large
and
hall
like,
though
irregular.
You
could
see
a
high
gable,
then
a
long
front,
then
a
low
gable,
then
a
thick,
lofty
stack
of
chimneys.
There
were
some
trees
behind
it.
It
was
dark;
not
a
candle
shone
from
any
window.
It
was
absolutely
still;
the
rain
running
from
the
eaves,
and
the
rather
wild
but
very
low
whistle
of
the
wind
round
the
chimneys
and
through
the
boughs
were
the
sole
sounds
in
its
neighbourhood.
This
building
passed,
the
fields,
hitherto
flat,
declined
in
a
rapid
descent.
Evidently
a
vale
lay
below,
through
which
you
could
hear
the
water
run.
One
light
glimmered
in
the
depth.
For
that
beacon
Malone
steered.
He
came
to
a
little
white
house
you
could
see
it
was
white
even
through
this
dense
darkness
and
knocked
at
the
door.
A
fresh
faced
servant
opened
it.
By
the
candle
she
held
was
revealed
a
narrow
passage,
terminating
in
a
narrow
stair.
Two
doors
covered
with
crimson
baize,
a
strip
of
crimson
carpet
down
the
steps,
contrasted
with
light
coloured
walls
and
white
floor,
made
the
little
interior
look
clean
and
fresh.
"Mr.
Moore
is
at
home,
I
suppose?"
"Yes,
sir,
but
he
is
not
in."
"Not
in!
Where
is
he
then?"
"At
the
mill
in
the
counting
house."
Here
one
of
the
crimson
doors
opened.
"Are
the
wagons
come,
Sarah?"
asked
a
female
voice,
and
a
female
head
at
the
same
time
was
apparent.
It
might
not
be
the
head
of
a
goddess
indeed
a
screw
of
curl
paper
on
each
side
the
temples
quite
forbade
that
supposition
but
neither
was
it
the
head
of
a
Gorgon;
yet
Malone
seemed
to
take
it
in
the
latter
light.
Big
as
he
was,
he
shrank
bashfully
back
into
the
rain
at
the
view
thereof,
and
saying,
"I'll
go
to
him,"
hurried
in
seeming
trepidation
down
a
short
lane,
across
an
obscure
yard,
towards
a
huge
black
mill.
The
work
hours
were
over;
the
"hands"
were
gone.
The
machinery
was
at
rest,
the
mill
shut
up.
Malone
walked
round
it.
Somewhere
in
its
great
sooty
flank
he
found
another
chink
of
light;
he
knocked
at
another
door,
using
for
the
purpose
the
thick
end
of
his
shillelah,
with
which
he
beat
a
rousing
tattoo.
A
key
turned;
the
door
unclosed.
"Is
it
Joe
Scott?
What
news
of
the
wagons,
Joe?"
"No;
it's
myself.
Mr.
Helstone
would
send
me."
"Oh!
Mr.
Malone."
The
voice
in
uttering
this
name
had
the
slightest
possible
cadence
of
disappointment.
After
a
moment's
pause
it
continued,
politely
but
a
little
formally,
"I
beg
you
will
come
in,
Mr.
Malone.
I
regret
extremely
Mr.
Helstone
should
have
thought
it
necessary
to
trouble
you
so
far.
There
was
no
necessity
I
told
him
so
and
on
such
a
night;
but
walk
forwards."
Through
a
dark
apartment,
of
aspect
undistinguishable,
Malone
followed
the
speaker
into
a
light
and
bright
room
within
very
light
and
bright
indeed
it
seemed
to
eyes
which,
for
the
last
hour,
had
been
striving
to
penetrate
the
double
darkness
of
night
and
fog;
but
except
for
its
excellent
fire,
and
for
a
lamp
of
elegant
design
and
vivid
lustre
burning
on
a
table,
it
was
a
very
plain
place.
The
boarded
floor
was
carpetless;
the
three
or
four
stiff
backed,
green
painted
chairs
seemed
once
to
have
furnished
the
kitchen
of
some
farm
house;
a
desk
of
strong,
solid
formation,
the
table
aforesaid,
and
some
framed
sheets
on
the
stone
coloured
walls,
bearing
plans
for
building,
for
gardening,
designs
of
machinery,
etc.,
completed
the
furniture
of
the
place.
Plain
as
it
was,
it
seemed
to
satisfy
Malone,
who,
when
he
had
removed
and
hung
up
his
wet
surtout
and
hat,
drew
one
of
the
rheumatic
looking
chairs
to
the
hearth,
and
set
his
knees
almost
within
the
bars
of
