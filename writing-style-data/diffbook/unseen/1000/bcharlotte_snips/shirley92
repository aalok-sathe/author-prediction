should
try
to
get
additional
subscriptions,
and
to
form
a
fund;
but
first
she
must
consult
the
clergy.
Yes,
on
that
point
she
was
peremptory.
Mr.
Helstone,
Dr.
Boultby,
Mr.
Hall,
must
be
consulted
(for
not
only
must
Briarfield
be
relieved,
but
Whinbury
and
Nunnely).
It
would,
she
averred,
be
presumption
in
her
to
take
a
single
step
unauthorized
by
them.
The
clergy
were
sacred
beings
in
Miss
Ainley's
eyes;
no
matter
what
might
be
the
insignificance
of
the
individual,
his
station
made
him
holy.
The
very
curates
who,
in
their
trivial
arrogance,
were
hardly
worthy
to
tie
her
patten
strings,
or
carry
her
cotton
umbrella,
or
check
woollen
shawl
she,
in
her
pure,
sincere
enthusiasm,
looked
upon
as
sucking
saints.
No
matter
how
clearly
their
little
vices
and
enormous
absurdities
were
pointed
out
to
her,
she
could
not
see
them;
she
was
blind
to
ecclesiastical
defects;
the
white
surplice
covered
a
multitude
of
sins.
Shirley,
knowing
this
harmless
infatuation
on
the
part
of
her
recently
chosen
prime
minister,
stipulated
expressly
that
the
curates
were
to
have
no
voice
in
the
disposal
of
the
money,
that
their
meddling
fingers
were
not
to
be
inserted
into
the
pie.
The
rectors,
of
course,
must
be
paramount,
and
they
might
be
trusted.
They
had
some
experience,
some
sagacity,
and
Mr.
Hall,
at
least,
had
sympathy
and
loving
kindness
for
his
fellow
men;
but
as
for
the
youth
under
them,
they
must
be
set
aside,
kept
down,
and
taught
that
subordination
and
silence
best
became
their
years
and
capacity.
It
was
with
some
horror
Miss
Ainley
heard
this
language.
Caroline,
however,
interposing
with
a
mild
word
or
two
in
praise
of
Mr
Sweeting,
calmed
her
again.
Sweeting
was,
indeed,
her
own
favourite.
She
endeavoured
to
respect
Messrs.
Malone
and
Donne,
but
the
slices
of
sponge
cake
and
glasses
of
cowslip
or
primrose
wine
she
had
at
different
times
administered
to
Sweeting,
when
he
came
to
see
her
in
her
little
cottage,
were
ever
offered
with
sentiments
of
truly
motherly
regard.
The
same
innocuous
collation
she
had
once
presented
to
Malone;
but
that
personage
evinced
such
open
scorn
of
the
offering,
she
had
never
ventured
to
renew
it.
To
Donne
she
always
served
the
treat,
and
was
happy
to
see
his
approbation
of
it
proved
beyond
a
doubt
by
the
fact
of
his
usually
eating
two
pieces
of
cake,
and
putting
a
third
in
his
pocket.
Indefatigable
in
her
exertions
where
good
was
to
be
done,
Miss
Ainley
would
immediately
have
set
out
on
a
walk
of
ten
miles
round
to
the
three
rectors,
in
order
to
show
her
plan,
and
humbly
solicit
their
approval;
but
Miss
Keeldar
interdicted
this,
and
proposed,
as
an
amendment,
to
collect
the
clergy
in
a
small
select
reunion
that
evening
at
Fieldhead.
Miss
Ainley
was
to
meet
them,
and
the
plan
was
to
be
discussed
in
full
privy
council.
Shirley
managed
to
get
the
senior
priesthood
together
accordingly,
and
before
the
old
maid's
arrival,
she
had,
further,
talked
all
the
gentlemen
into
the
most
charming
mood
imaginable.
She
herself
had
taken
in
hand
Dr.
Boultby
and
Mr.
Helstone.
The
first
was
a
stubborn
old
Welshman,
hot,
opinionated,
and
obstinate,
but
withal
a
man
who
did
a
great
deal
of
good,
though
not
without
making
some
noise
about
it.
The
latter
we
know.
She
had
rather
a
friendly
feeling
for
both,
especially
for
old
Helstone;
and
it
cost
her
no
trouble
to
be
quite
delightful
to
them.
She
took
them
round
the
garden;
she
gathered
them
flowers;
she
was
like
a
kind
daughter
to
them.
Mr.
Hall
she
left
to
Caroline
or
rather,
it
was
to
Caroline's
care
Mr.
Hall
consigned
himself.
He
generally
sought
Caroline
in
every
party
where
she
and
he
happened
to
be.
He
was
not
in
general
a
lady's
man,
though
all
ladies
liked
him;
something
of
a
book
worm
he
was,
near
sighted,
spectacled,
now
and
then
abstracted.
To
old
ladies
he
was
kind
as
a
son.
To
men
of
every
occupation
and
grade
he
was
acceptable.
The
truth,
simplicity,
frankness
of
his
manners,
the
nobleness
of
his
integrity,
the
reality
and
elevation
of
his
piety,
won
him
friends
in
every
grade.
His
poor
clerk
and
sexton
delighted
in
him;
the
noble
patron
of
his
living
esteemed
him
highly.
It
was
only
with
young,
handsome,
fashionable,
and
stylish
ladies
he
felt
a
little
shy.
Being
himself
a
plain
man
plain
in
aspect,
plain
in
manners,
plain
in
speech
he
seemed
to
fear
their
dash,
elegance,
and
airs.
But
Miss
Helstone
had
neither
dash
nor
airs,
and
her
native
elegance
was
of
a
very
quiet
order
quiet
as
the
beauty
of
a
ground
loving
hedge
flower.
He
was
a
fluent,
cheerful,
agreeable
talker.
Caroline
could
talk
too
in
a
tete
a
tete.
She
liked
Mr.
Hall
to
come
and
take
the
seat
next
her
in
a
party,
and
thus
secure
her
from
Peter
Augustus
Malone,
Joseph
Donne,
or
John
Sykes;
and
Mr.
Hall
never
failed
to
avail
himself
of
this
privilege
when
he
possibly
could.
Such
preference
shown
by
a
single
gentleman
to
a
single
lady
would
certainly,
in
ordinary
cases,
have
set
in
motion
the
tongues
of
the
gossips;
but
Cyril
Hall
was
forty
five
years
old,
slightly
bald,
and
slightly
gray,
and
nobody
ever
said
or
thought
he
was
likely
to
be
married
to
Miss
Helstone.
Nor
did
he
think
so
himself.
He
was
wedded
already
to
his
books
and
his
parish.
His
kind
sister
Margaret,
spectacled
and
learned
like
himself,
made
him
happy
in
his
single
state;
he
considered
it
too
late
to
change.
Besides,
he
had
known
Caroline
as
a
pretty
little
girl.
She
had
sat
on
his
knee
many
a
time;
he
had
bought
her
toys
and
given
her
books;
he
felt
that
her
friendship
for
him
was
mixed
with
a
sort
of
filial
respect;
he
could
not
have
brought
himself
to
attempt
to
give
another
colour
to
her
sentiments,
and
his
serene
mind
could
glass
a
fair
image
without
feeling
