his
stay.
His
wife,
after
a
year
or
two,
was
of
no
great
importance
to
him
in
any
shape;
and
when
she
one
day,
as
he
thought,
suddenly
for
he
had
scarcely
noticed
her
decline
but,
as
others
thought,
gradually,
took
her
leave
of
him
and
of
life,
and
there
was
only
a
still,
beautiful
featured
mould
of
clay
left,
cold
and
white,
in
the
conjugal
couch,
he
felt
his
bereavement
who
shall
say
how
little?
Yet,
perhaps,
more
than
he
seemed
to
feel
it;
for
he
was
not
a
man
from
whom
grief
easily
wrung
tears.
His
dry
eyed
and
sober
mourning
scandalized
an
old
housekeeper,
and
likewise
a
female
attendant,
who
had
waited
upon
Mrs.
Helstone
in
her
sickness,
and
who,
perhaps,
had
had
opportunities
of
learning
more
of
the
deceased
lady's
nature,
of
her
capacity
for
feeling
and
loving,
than
her
husband
knew.
They
gossiped
together
over
the
corpse,
related
anecdotes,
with
embellishments
of
her
lingering
decline,
and
its
real
or
supposed
cause.
In
short,
they
worked
each
other
up
to
some
indignation
against
the
austere
little
man,
who
sat
examining
papers
in
an
adjoining
room,
unconscious
of
what
opprobrium
he
was
the
object.
Mrs.
Helstone
was
hardly
under
the
sod
when
rumours
began
to
be
rife
in
the
neighbourhood
that
she
had
died
of
a
broken
heart.
These
magnified
quickly
into
reports
of
hard
usage,
and,
finally,
details
of
harsh
treatment
on
the
part
of
her
husband
reports
grossly
untrue,
but
not
the
less
eagerly
received
on
that
account.
Mr.
Yorke
heard
them,
partly
believed
them.
Already,
of
course,
he
had
no
friendly
feeling
to
his
successful
rival.
Though
himself
a
married
man
now,
and
united
to
a
woman
who
seemed
a
complete
contrast
to
Mary
Cave
in
all
respects,
he
could
not
forget
the
great
disappointment
of
his
life;
and
when
he
heard
that
what
would
have
been
so
precious
to
him
had
been
neglected,
perhaps
abused,
by
another,
he
conceived
for
that
other
a
rooted
and
bitter
animosity.
Of
the
nature
and
strength
of
this
animosity
Mr.
Helstone
was
but
half
aware.
He
neither
knew
how
much
Yorke
had
loved
Mary
Cave,
what
he
had
felt
on
losing
her,
nor
was
he
conscious
of
the
calumnies
concerning
his
treatment
of
her,
familiar
to
every
ear
in
the
neighbourhood
but
his
own.
He
believed
political
and
religious
differences
alone
separated
him
and
Mr.
Yorke.
Had
he
known
how
the
case
really
stood,
he
would
hardly
have
been
induced
by
any
persuasion
to
cross
his
former
rival's
threshold.
Mr.
Yorke
did
not
resume
his
lecture
of
Robert
Moore.
The
conversation
ere
long
recommenced
in
a
more
general
form,
though
still
in
a
somewhat
disputative
tone.
The
unquiet
state
of
the
country,
the
various
depredations
lately
committed
on
mill
property
in
the
district,
supplied
abundant
matter
for
disagreement,
especially
as
each
of
the
three
gentlemen
present
differed
more
or
less
in
his
views
on
these
subjects.
Mr.
Helstone
thought
the
masters
aggrieved,
the
workpeople
unreasonable;
he
condemned
sweepingly
the
widespread
spirit
of
disaffection
against
constituted
authorities,
the
growing
indisposition
to
bear
with
patience
evils
he
regarded
as
inevitable.
The
cures
he
prescribed
were
vigorous
government
interference,
strict
magisterial
vigilance;
when
necessary,
prompt
military
coercion.
Mr.
Yorke
wished
to
know
whether
this
interference,
vigilance,
and
coercion
would
feed
those
who
were
hungry,
give
work
to
those
who
wanted
work,
and
whom
no
man
would
hire.
He
scouted
the
idea
of
inevitable
evils.
He
said
public
patience
was
a
camel,
on
whose
back
the
last
atom
that
could
be
borne
had
already
been
laid,
and
that
resistance
was
now
a
duty;
the
widespread
spirit
of
disaffection
against
constituted
authorities
he
regarded
as
the
most
promising
sign
of
the
times;
the
masters,
he
allowed,
were
truly
aggrieved,
but
their
main
grievances
had
been
heaped
on
them
by
a
"corrupt,
base,
and
bloody"
government
(these
were
Mr.
Yorke's
epithets).
Madmen
like
Pitt,
demons
like
Castlereagh,
mischievous
idiots
like
Perceval,
were
the
tyrants,
the
curses
of
the
country,
the
destroyers
of
her
trade.
It
was
their
infatuated
perseverance
in
an
unjustifiable,
a
hopeless,
a
ruinous
war,
which
had
brought
the
nation
to
its
present
pass.
It
was
their
monstrously
oppressive
taxation,
it
was
the
infamous
"Orders
in
Council"
the
originators
of
which
deserved
impeachment
and
the
scaffold,
if
ever
public
men
did
that
hung
a
millstone
about
England's
neck.
"But
where
was
the
use
of
talking?"
he
demanded.
"What
chance
was
there
of
reason
being
heard
in
a
land
that
was
king
ridden,
priest
ridden,
peer
ridden;
where
a
lunatic
was
the
nominal
monarch,
an
unprincipled
debauchee
the
real
ruler;
where
such
an
insult
to
common
sense
as
hereditary
legislators
was
tolerated;
where
such
a
humbug
as
a
bench
of
bishops,
such
an
arrogant
abuse
as
a
pampered,
persecuting
established
church
was
endured
and
venerated;
where
a
standing
army
was
maintained,
and
a
host
of
lazy
parsons
and
their
pauper
families
were
kept
on
the
fat
of
the
land?"
Mr.
Helstone,
rising
up
and
putting
on
his
shovel
hat,
observed
in
reply,
"that
in
the
course
of
his
life
he
had
met
with
two
or
three
instances
where
sentiments
of
this
sort
had
been
very
bravely
maintained
so
long
as
health,
strength,
and
worldly
prosperity
had
been
the
allies
of
him
who
professed
them;
but
there
came
a
time,"
he
said,
"to
all
men,
'when
the
keepers
of
the
house
should
tremble;
when
they
should
be
afraid
of
that
which
is
high,
and
fear
should
be
in
the
way;'
and
that
time
was
the
test
of
the
advocate
of
anarchy
and
rebellion,
the
enemy
of
religion
and
order.
Ere
now,"
he
affirmed,
"he
had
been
called
upon
to
read
those
prayers
our
church
has
provided
for
the
sick
by
the
miserable
dying
bed
of
one
of
her
most
rancorous
foes;
he
had
seen
such
a
one
stricken
with
remorse,
solicitous
to
discover
a
place
for
repentance,
and
unable
to
find
any,
though
he
sought
it
carefully
with
tears.
He
must
forewarn
Mr.
