(you
cannot
know
how
it
happened,
reader;
your
curiosity
must
be
robbed
to
pay
your
elegant
love
of
the
pretty
and
pleasing),
there
came
as
his
successor
another
Irish
curate,
Mr.
Macarthey.
I
am
happy
to
be
able
to
inform
you,
with
truth,
that
this
gentleman
did
as
much
credit
to
his
country
as
Malone
had
done
it
discredit.
He
proved
himself
as
decent,
decorous,
and
conscientious
as
Peter
was
rampant,
boisterous,
and
This
last
epithet
I
choose
to
suppress,
because
it
would
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag.
He
laboured
faithfully
in
the
parish.
The
schools,
both
Sunday
and
day
schools,
flourished
under
his
sway
like
green
bay
trees.
Being
human,
of
course
he
had
his
faults.
These,
however,
were
proper,
steady
going,
clerical
faults
what
many
would
call
virtues.
The
circumstance
of
finding
himself
invited
to
tea
with
a
Dissenter
would
unhinge
him
for
a
week.
The
spectacle
of
a
Quaker
wearing
his
hat
in
the
church,
the
thought
of
an
unbaptized
fellow
creature
being
interred
with
Christian
rites
these
things
could
make
strange
havoc
in
Mr.
Macarthey's
physical
and
mental
economy.
Otherwise
he
was
sane
and
rational,
diligent
and
charitable.
I
doubt
not
a
justice
loving
public
will
have
remarked,
ere
this,
that
I
have
thus
far
shown
a
criminal
remissness
in
pursuing,
catching,
and
bringing
to
condign
punishment
the
would
be
assassin
of
Mr.
Robert
Moore.
Here
was
a
fine
opening
to
lead
my
willing
readers
a
dance,
at
once
decorous
and
exciting
a
dance
of
law
and
gospel,
of
the
dungeon,
the
dock,
and
the
"dead
thraw."
You
might
have
liked
it,
reader,
but
I
should
not.
I
and
my
subject
would
presently
have
quarrelled,
and
then
I
should
have
broken
down.
I
was
happy
to
find
that
facts
perfectly
exonerated
me
from
the
attempt.
The
murderer
was
never
punished,
for
the
good
reason
that
he
was
never
caught
the
result
of
the
further
circumstance
that
he
was
never
pursued.
The
magistrates
made
a
shuffling,
as
if
they
were
going
to
rise
and
do
valiant
things;
but
since
Moore
himself,
instead
of
urging
and
leading
them
as
heretofore,
lay
still
on
his
little
cottage
couch,
laughing
in
his
sleeve,
and
sneering
with
every
feature
of
his
pale,
foreign
face,
they
considered
better
of
it,
and
after
fulfilling
certain
indispensable
forms,
prudently
resolved
to
let
the
matter
quietly
drop,
which
they
did.
Mr.
Moore
knew
who
had
shot
him,
and
all
Briarfield
knew.
It
was
no
other
than
Michael
Hartley,
the
half
crazed
weaver
once
before
alluded
to,
a
frantic
Antinomian
in
religion,
and
a
mad
leveller
in
politics.
The
poor
soul
died
of
delirium
tremens
a
year
after
the
attempt
on
Moore,
and
Robert
gave
his
wretched
widow
a
guinea
to
bury
him.
The
winter
is
over
and
gone;
spring
has
followed
with
beamy
and
shadowy,
with
flowery
and
showery
flight.
We
are
now
in
the
heart
of
summer
in
mid
June
the
June
of
1812.
It
is
burning
weather.
The
air
is
deep
azure
and
red
gold.
It
fits
the
time;
it
fits
the
age;
it
fits
the
present
spirit
of
the
nations.
The
nineteenth
century
wantons
in
its
giant
adolescence;
the
Titan
boy
uproots
mountains
in
his
game,
and
hurls
rocks
in
his
wild
sport.
This
summer
Bonaparte
is
in
the
saddle;
he
and
his
host
scour
Russian
deserts.
He
has
with
him
Frenchmen
and
Poles,
Italians
and
children
of
the
Rhine,
six
hundred
thousand
strong.
He
marches
on
old
Moscow.
Under
old
Moscow's
walls
the
rude
Cossack
waits
him.
Barbarian
stoic!
he
waits
without
fear
of
the
boundless
ruin
rolling
on.
He
puts
his
trust
in
a
snow
cloud;
the
wilderness,
the
wind,
and
the
hail
storm
are
his
refuge;
his
allies
are
the
elements
air,
fire,
water.
And
what
are
these?
Three
terrible
archangels
ever
stationed
before
the
throne
of
Jehovah.
They
stand
clothed
in
white,
girdled
with
golden
girdles;
they
uplift
vials,
brimming
with
the
wrath
of
God.
Their
time
is
the
day
of
vengeance;
their
signal,
the
word
of
the
Lord
of
hosts,
"thundering
with
the
voice
of
His
excellency."
"Hast
thou
entered
into
the
treasures
of
the
snow?
or
hast
thou
seen
the
treasures
of
the
hail,
which
I
have
reserved
against
the
time
of
trouble,
against
the
day
of
battle
and
war?
"Go
your
ways.
Pour
out
the
vials
of
the
wrath
of
God
upon
the
earth."
It
is
done.
The
earth
is
scorched
with
fire;
the
sea
becomes
"as
the
blood
of
a
dead
man;"
the
islands
flee
away;
the
mountains
are
not
found.
In
this
year,
Lord
Wellington
assumed
the
reins
in
Spain.
They
made
him
generalissimo,
for
their
own
salvation's
sake.
In
this
year
he
took
Badajos,
he
fought
the
field
of
Vittoria,
he
captured
Pampeluna,
he
stormed
San
Sebastian;
in
this
year
he
won
Salamanca.
Men
of
Manchester,
I
beg
your
pardon
for
this
slight
resume
of
warlike
facts,
but
it
is
of
no
consequence.
Lord
Wellington
is,
for
you,
only
a
decayed
old
gentleman
now.
I
rather
think
some
of
you
have
called
him
a
"dotard;"
you
have
taunted
him
with
his
age
and
the
loss
of
his
physical
vigour.
What
fine
heroes
you
are
yourselves!
Men
like
you
have
a
right
to
trample
on
what
is
mortal
in
a
demigod.
Scoff
at
your
ease;
your
scorn
can
never
break
his
grand
old
heart.
But
come,
friends,
whether
Quakers
or
cotton
printers,
let
us
hold
a
peace
congress,
and
let
out
our
venom
quietly.
We
have
been
talking
with
unseemly
zeal
about
bloody
battles
and
butchering
generals;
we
arrive
now
at
a
triumph
in
your
line.
On
the
18th
of
June
1812
the
Orders
in
Council
were
repealed,
and
the
blockaded
ports
thrown
open.
You
know
very
well
such
of
you
as
are
old
enough
to
remember
you
made
Yorkshire
and
Lancashire
shake
with
your
shout
on
that
occasion.
The
ringers
cracked
a
bell
in
Briarfield
belfry;
it
is
dissonant
to
this
day.
The
Association
of
Merchants
and
Manufacturers
dined
together
