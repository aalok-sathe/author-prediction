with
her
in
my
life."
"No;
you
are
most
generously
considerate,
indeed,
most
tenderly
indulgent
to
her;
and
you
will
be
considerate
with
mamma.
You
are
a
gentleman
all
through,
Robert,
to
the
bone,
and
nowhere
so
perfect
a
gentleman
as
at
your
own
fireside."
"A
eulogium
I
like;
it
is
very
sweet.
I
am
well
pleased
my
Caroline
should
view
me
in
this
light."
"Mamma
just
thinks
of
you
as
I
do."
"Not
quite,
I
hope?"
"She
does
not
want
to
marry
you
don't
be
vain;
but
she
said
to
me
the
other
day,
'My
dear,
Mr.
Moore
has
pleasing
manners;
he
is
one
of
the
few
gentlemen
I
have
seen
who
combine
politeness
with
an
air
of
sincerity.'"
"'Mamma'
is
rather
a
misanthropist,
is
she
not?
Not
the
best
opinion
of
the
sterner
sex?"
"She
forbears
to
judge
them
as
a
whole,
but
she
has
her
exceptions
whom
she
admires
Louis
and
Mr.
Hall,
and,
of
late,
yourself.
She
did
not
like
you
once;
I
knew
that,
because
she
would
never
speak
of
you.
But,
Robert
"
"Well,
what
now?
What
is
the
new
thought?"
"You
have
not
seen
my
uncle
yet?"
"I
have.
'Mamma'
called
him
into
the
room.
He
consents
conditionally.
If
I
prove
that
I
can
keep
a
wife,
I
may
have
her;
and
I
can
keep
her
better
than
he
thinks
better
than
I
choose
to
boast."
"If
you
get
rich
you
will
do
good
with
your
money,
Robert?"
"I
will
do
good;
you
shall
tell
me
how.
Indeed,
I
have
some
schemes
of
my
own,
which
you
and
I
will
talk
about
on
our
own
hearth
one
day.
I
have
seen
the
necessity
of
doing
good;
I
have
learned
the
downright
folly
of
being
selfish.
Caroline,
I
foresee
what
I
will
now
foretell.
This
war
must
ere
long
draw
to
a
close.
Trade
is
likely
to
prosper
for
some
years
to
come.
There
may
be
a
brief
misunderstanding
between
England
and
America,
but
that
will
not
last.
What
would
you
think
if,
one
day
perhaps
ere
another
ten
years
elapse
Louis
and
I
divide
Briarfield
parish
betwixt
us?
Louis,
at
any
rate,
is
certain
of
power
and
property.
He
will
not
bury
his
talents.
He
is
a
benevolent
fellow,
and
has,
besides,
an
intellect
of
his
own
of
no
trifling
calibre.
His
mind
is
slow
but
strong.
It
must
work.
It
may
work
deliberately,
but
it
will
work
well.
He
will
be
made
magistrate
of
the
district
Shirley
says
he
shall.
She
would
proceed
impetuously
and
prematurely
to
obtain
for
him
this
dignity,
if
he
would
let
her,
but
he
will
not.
As
usual,
he
will
be
in
no
haste.
Ere
he
has
been
master
of
Fieldhead
a
year
all
the
district
will
feel
his
quiet
influence,
and
acknowledge
his
unassuming
superiority.
A
magistrate
is
wanted;
they
will,
in
time,
invest
him
with
the
office
voluntarily
and
unreluctantly.
Everybody
admires
his
future
wife,
and
everybody
will,
in
time,
like
him.
He
is
of
the
pate
generally
approved,
bon
comme
le
pain
daily
bread
for
the
most
fastidious,
good
for
the
infant
and
the
aged,
nourishing
for
the
poor,
wholesome
for
the
rich.
Shirley,
in
spite
of
her
whims
and
oddities,
her
dodges
and
delays,
has
an
infatuated
fondness
for
him.
She
will
one
day
see
him
as
universally
beloved
as
even
she
could
wish.
He
will
also
be
universally
esteemed,
considered,
consulted,
depended
on
too
much
so.
His
advice
will
be
always
judicious,
his
help
always
good
natured.
Ere
long
both
will
be
in
inconvenient
request.
He
will
have
to
impose
restrictions.
As
for
me,
if
I
succeed
as
I
intend
to
do,
my
success
will
add
to
his
and
Shirley's
income.
I
can
double
the
value
of
their
mill
property.
I
can
line
yonder
barren
Hollow
with
lines
of
cottages
and
rows
of
cottage
gardens
"
"Robert!
And
root
up
the
copse?"
"The
copse
shall
be
firewood
ere
five
years
elapse.
The
beautiful
wild
ravine
shall
be
a
smooth
descent;
the
green
natural
terrace
shall
be
a
paved
street.
There
shall
be
cottages
in
the
dark
ravine,
and
cottages
on
the
lonely
slopes.
The
rough
pebbled
track
shall
be
an
even,
firm,
broad,
black,
sooty
road,
bedded
with
the
cinders
from
my
mill;
and
my
mill,
Caroline
my
mill
shall
fill
its
present
yard."
"Horrible!
You
will
change
our
blue
hill
country
air
into
the
Stilbro'
smoke
atmosphere."
"I
will
pour
the
waters
of
Pactolus
through
the
valley
of
Briarfield."
"I
like
the
beck
a
thousand
times
better."
"I
will
get
an
Act
for
enclosing
Nunnely
Common,
and
parcelling
it
out
into
farms."
"Stilbro'
Moor,
however,
defies
you,
thank
Heaven!
What
can
you
grow
in
Bilberry
Moss?
What
will
flourish
on
Rushedge?"
"Caroline,
the
houseless,
the
starving,
the
unemployed
shall
come
to
Hollow's
Mill
from
far
and
near;
and
Joe
Scott
shall
give
them
work,
and
Louis
Moore,
Esq.,
shall
let
them
a
tenement,
and
Mrs.
Gill
shall
mete
them
a
portion
till
the
first
pay
day."
She
smiled
up
in
his
face.
"Such
a
Sunday
school
as
you
will
have,
Cary!
such
collections
as
you
will
get!
such
a
day
school
as
you
and
Shirley
and
Miss
Ainley
will
have
to
manage
between
you!
The
mill
shall
find
salaries
for
a
master
and
mistress,
and
the
squire
or
the
clothier
shall
give
a
treat
once
a
quarter."
She
mutely
offered
a
kiss
an
offer
taken
unfair
advantage
of,
to
the
extortion
of
about
a
hundred
kisses.
"Extravagant
day
dreams,"
said
Moore,
with
a
sigh
and
smile,
"yet
perhaps
we
may
realize
some
of
them.
Meantime,
the
dew
is
falling.
Mrs.
Moore,
I
shall
take
you
in."
It
is
August.
The
bells
clash
out
again,
not
only
through
Yorkshire,
but
through
England.
From
Spain
the
voice
of
a
trumpet
has
sounded
long;
it
now
waxes
louder
and
louder;
it
proclaims
Salamanca
won.
This
night
is
Briarfield
to
be
illuminated.
On
this
day
the
Fieldhead
tenantry
dine
together;
the
Hollow's
Mill
workpeople
will
