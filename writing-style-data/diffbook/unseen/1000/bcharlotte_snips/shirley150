draws
nigh,
knows
that
it
is
God's
will
his
idol
shall
be
broken,
and
bends
his
head,
and
subdues
his
soul
to
the
sentence
he
cannot
avert
and
scarce
can
bear.
Happy
Mrs.
Pryor!
She
was
still
praying,
unconscious
that
the
summer
sun
hung
above
the
hills,
when
her
child
softly
woke
in
her
arms.
No
piteous,
unconscious
moaning
sound
which
so
wastes
our
strength
that,
even
if
we
have
sworn
to
be
firm,
a
rush
of
unconquerable
tears
sweeps
away
the
oath
preceded
her
waking.
No
space
of
deaf
apathy
followed.
The
first
words
spoken
were
not
those
of
one
becoming
estranged
from
this
world,
and
already
permitted
to
stray
at
times
into
realms
foreign
to
the
living.
Caroline
evidently
remembered
with
clearness
what
had
happened.
"Mamma,
I
have
slept
so
well.
I
only
dreamed
and
woke
twice."
Mrs.
Pryor
rose
with
a
start,
that
her
daughter
might
not
see
the
joyful
tears
called
into
her
eyes
by
that
affectionate
word
"mamma,"
and
the
welcome
assurance
that
followed
it.
For
many
days
the
mother
dared
rejoice
only
with
trembling.
That
first
revival
seemed
like
the
flicker
of
a
dying
lamp.
If
the
flame
streamed
up
bright
one
moment,
the
next
it
sank
dim
in
the
socket.
Exhaustion
followed
close
on
excitement.
There
was
always
a
touching
endeavour
to
appear
better,
but
too
often
ability
refused
to
second
will;
too
often
the
attempt
to
bear
up
failed.
The
effort
to
eat,
to
talk,
to
look
cheerful,
was
unsuccessful.
Many
an
hour
passed
during
which
Mrs.
Pryor
feared
that
the
chords
of
life
could
never
more
be
strengthened,
though
the
time
of
their
breaking
might
be
deferred.
During
this
space
the
mother
and
daughter
seemed
left
almost
alone
in
the
neighbourhood.
It
was
the
close
of
August;
the
weather
was
fine
that
is
to
say,
it
was
very
dry
and
very
dusty,
for
an
arid
wind
had
been
blowing
from
the
east
this
month
past;
very
cloudless,
too,
though
a
pale
haze,
stationary
in
the
atmosphere,
seemed
to
rob
of
all
depth
of
tone
the
blue
of
heaven,
of
all
freshness
the
verdure
of
earth,
and
of
all
glow
the
light
of
day.
Almost
every
family
in
Briarfield
was
absent
on
an
excursion.
Miss
Keeldar
and
her
friends
were
at
the
seaside;
so
were
Mrs.
Yorke's
household.
Mr.
Hall
and
Louis
Moore,
between
whom
a
spontaneous
intimacy
seemed
to
have
arisen
the
result,
probably,
of
harmony
of
views
and
temperament
were
gone
"up
north"
on
a
pedestrian
excursion
to
the
Lakes.
Even
Hortense,
who
would
fain
have
stayed
at
home
and
aided
Mrs.
Pryor
in
nursing
Caroline,
had
been
so
earnestly
entreated
by
Miss
Mann
to
accompany
her
once
more
to
Wormwood
Wells,
in
the
hope
of
alleviating
sufferings
greatly
aggravated
by
the
insalubrious
weather,
that
she
felt
obliged
to
comply;
indeed,
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
refuse
a
request
that
at
once
appealed
to
her
goodness
of
heart,
and,
by
a
confession
of
dependency,
flattered
her
amour
propre.
As
for
Robert,
from
Birmingham
he
had
gone
on
to
London,
where
he
still
sojourned.
So
long
as
the
breath
of
Asiatic
deserts
parched
Caroline's
lips
and
fevered
her
veins,
her
physical
convalescence
could
not
keep
pace
with
her
returning
mental
tranquillity;
but
there
came
a
day
when
the
wind
ceased
to
sob
at
the
eastern
gable
of
the
rectory,
and
at
the
oriel
window
of
the
church.
A
little
cloud
like
a
man's
hand
arose
in
the
west;
gusts
from
the
same
quarter
drove
it
on
and
spread
it
wide;
wet
and
tempest
prevailed
a
while.
When
that
was
over
the
sun
broke
out
genially,
heaven
regained
its
azure,
and
earth
its
green;
the
livid
cholera
tint
had
vanished
from
the
face
of
nature;
the
hills
rose
clear
round
the
horizon,
absolved
from
that
pale
malaria
haze.
Caroline's
youth
could
now
be
of
some
avail
to
her,
and
so
could
her
mother's
nurture.
Both,
crowned
by
God's
blessing,
sent
in
the
pure
west
wind
blowing
soft
as
fresh
through
the
ever
open
chamber
lattice,
rekindled
her
long
languishing
energies.
At
last
Mrs.
Pryor
saw
that
it
was
permitted
to
hope:
a
genuine,
material
convalescence
had
commenced.
It
was
not
merely
Caroline's
smile
which
was
brighter,
or
her
spirits
which
were
cheered,
but
a
certain
look
had
passed
from
her
face
and
eye
a
look
dread
and
indescribable,
but
which
will
easily
be
recalled
by
those
who
have
watched
the
couch
of
dangerous
disease.
Long
before
the
emaciated
outlines
of
her
aspect
began
to
fill,
or
its
departed
colour
to
return,
a
more
subtle
change
took
place;
all
grew
softer
and
warmer.
Instead
of
a
marble
mask
and
glassy
eye,
Mrs.
Pryor
saw
laid
on
the
pillow
a
face
pale
and
wasted
enough,
perhaps
more
haggard
than
the
other
appearance,
but
less
awful;
for
it
was
a
sick,
living
girl,
not
a
mere
white
mould
or
rigid
piece
of
statuary.
Now,
too,
she
was
not
always
petitioning
to
drink.
The
words,
"I
am
so
thirsty,"
ceased
to
be
her
plaint.
Sometimes,
when
she
had
swallowed
a
morsel,
she
would
say
it
had
revived
her.
All
descriptions
of
food
were
no
longer
equally
distasteful;
she
could
be
induced,
sometimes,
to
indicate
a
preference.
With
what
trembling
pleasure
and
anxious
care
did
not
her
nurse
prepare
what
was
selected!
How
she
watched
her
as
she
partook
of
it!
Nourishment
brought
strength.
She
could
sit
up.
Then
she
longed
to
breathe
the
fresh
air,
to
revisit
her
flowers,
to
see
how
the
fruit
had
ripened.
Her
uncle,
always
liberal,
had
bought
a
garden
chair
for
her
express
use.
He
carried
her
down
in
his
own
arms,
and
placed
her
in
it
himself,
and
William
Farren
was
there
to
wheel
her
round
the
walks,
to
show
her
what
he
had
done
amongst
her
plants,
to
take
her
directions
for
further
work.
William
and
she
found
plenty
to
talk
about.
They
had
a
dozen
topics
in
common
interesting
to
them,
unimportant
to
the
rest
of
