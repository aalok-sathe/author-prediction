thinking
when
I
inquired
after
the
wounded.
What
damage
have
your
opponents
sustained?"
"One
of
the
rioters,
or
victims
as
you
call
them,
was
killed,
and
six
were
hurt."
"What
have
you
done
with
them?"
"What
you
will
perfectly
approve.
Medical
aid
was
procured
immediately;
and
as
soon
as
we
can
get
a
couple
of
covered
wagons
and
some
clean
straw,
they
will
be
removed
to
Stilbro'."
"Straw!
You
must
have
beds
and
bedding.
I
will
send
my
wagon
directly,
properly
furnished;
and
Mr.
Yorke,
I
am
sure,
will
send
his."
"You
guess
correctly;
he
has
volunteered
already.
And
Mrs.
Yorke
who,
like
you,
seems
disposed
to
regard
the
rioters
as
martyrs,
and
me,
and
especially
Mr.
Helstone,
as
murderers
is
at
this
moment,
I
believe,
most
assiduously
engaged
in
fitting
it
up
with
feather
beds,
pillows,
bolsters,
blankets,
etc.
The
victims
lack
no
attentions,
I
promise
you.
Mr.
Hall,
your
favourite
parson,
has
been
with
them
ever
since
six
o'clock,
exhorting
them,
praying
with
them,
and
even
waiting
on
them
like
any
nurse;
and
Caroline's
good
friend,
Miss
Ainley,
that
very
plain
old
maid,
sent
in
a
stock
of
lint
and
linen,
something
in
the
proportion
of
another
lady's
allowance
of
beef
and
wine."
"That
will
do.
Where
is
your
sister?"
"Well
cared
for.
I
had
her
securely
domiciled
with
Miss
Mann.
This
very
morning
the
two
set
out
for
Wormwood
Wells
[a
noted
watering
place],
and
will
stay
there
some
weeks."
"So
Mr.
Helstone
domiciled
me
at
the
rectory!
Mighty
clever
you
gentlemen
think
you
are!
I
make
you
heartily
welcome
to
the
idea,
and
hope
its
savour,
as
you
chew
the
cud
of
reflection
upon
it,
gives
you
pleasure.
Acute
and
astute,
why
are
you
not
also
omniscient?
How
is
it
that
events
transpire,
under
your
very
noses,
of
which
you
have
no
suspicion?
It
should
be
so,
otherwise
the
exquisite
gratification
of
outmanoeuvring
you
would
be
unknown.
Ah,
friend,
you
may
search
my
countenance,
but
you
cannot
read
it."
Moore,
indeed,
looked
as
if
he
could
not.
"You
think
me
a
dangerous
specimen
of
my
sex.
Don't
you
now?"
"A
peculiar
one,
at
least."
"But
Caroline
is
she
peculiar?"
"In
her
way
yes."
"Her
way!
What
is
her
way?"
"You
know
her
as
well
as
I
do."
"And
knowing
her,
I
assert
that
she
is
neither
eccentric
nor
difficult
of
control.
Is
she?"
"That
depends
"
"However,
there
is
nothing
masculine
about
her?"
"Why
lay
such
emphasis
on
her?
Do
you
consider
her
a
contrast,
in
that
respect,
to
yourself?"
"You
do,
no
doubt;
but
that
does
not
signify.
Caroline
is
neither
masculine,
nor
of
what
they
call
the
spirited
order
of
women."
"I
have
seen
her
flash
out."
"So
have
I,
but
not
with
manly
fire.
It
was
a
short,
vivid,
trembling
glow,
that
shot
up,
shone,
vanished
"
"And
left
her
scared
at
her
own
daring.
You
describe
others
besides
Caroline."
"The
point
I
wish
to
establish
is,
that
Miss
Helstone,
though
gentle,
tractable,
and
candid
enough,
is
still
perfectly
capable
of
defying
even
Mr.
Moore's
penetration."
"What
have
you
and
she
been
doing?"
asked
Moore
suddenly.
"Have
you
had
any
breakfast?"
"What
is
your
mutual
mystery?"
"If
you
are
hungry,
Mrs.
Gill
will
give
you
something
to
eat
here.
Step
into
the
oak
parlour,
and
ring
the
bell.
You
will
be
served
as
if
at
an
inn;
or,
if
you
like
better,
go
back
to
the
Hollow."
"The
alternative
is
not
open
to
me;
I
must
go
back.
Good
morning.
The
first
leisure
I
have
I
will
see
you
again."
While
Shirley
was
talking
with
Moore,
Caroline
rejoined
Mrs.
Pryor
upstairs.
She
found
that
lady
deeply
depressed.
She
would
not
say
that
Miss
Keeldar's
hastiness
had
hurt
her
feelings,
but
it
was
evident
an
inward
wound
galled
her.
To
any
but
a
congenial
nature
she
would
have
seemed
insensible
to
the
quiet,
tender
attentions
by
which
Miss
Helstone
sought
to
impart
solace;
but
Caroline
knew
that,
unmoved
or
slightly
moved
as
she
looked,
she
felt,
valued,
and
was
healed
by
them.
"I
am
deficient
in
self
confidence
and
decision,"
she
said
at
last.
"I
always
have
been
deficient
in
those
qualities.
Yet
I
think
Miss
Keeldar
should
have
known
my
character
well
enough
by
this
time
to
be
aware
that
I
always
feel
an
even
painful
solicitude
to
do
right,
to
act
for
the
best.
The
unusual
nature
of
the
demand
on
my
judgment
puzzled
me,
especially
following
the
alarms
of
the
night.
I
could
not
venture
to
act
promptly
for
another;
but
I
trust
no
serious
harm
will
result
from
my
lapse
of
firmness."
A
gentle
knock
was
here
heard
at
the
door.
It
was
half
opened.
"Caroline,
come
here,"
said
a
low
voice.
Miss
Helstone
went
out.
There
stood
Shirley
in
the
gallery,
looking
contrite,
ashamed,
sorry
as
any
repentant
child.
"How
is
Mrs.
Pryor?"
she
asked.
"Rather
out
of
spirits,"
said
Caroline.
"I
have
behaved
very
shamefully,
very
ungenerously,
very
ungratefully
to
her,"
said
Shirley.
"How
insolent
in
me
to
turn
on
her
thus
for
what,
after
all,
was
no
fault
only
an
excess
of
conscientiousness
on
her
part.
But
I
regret
my
error
most
sincerely.
Tell
her
so,
and
ask
if
she
will
forgive
me."
Caroline
discharged
the
errand
with
heartfelt
pleasure.
Mrs.
Pryor
rose,
came
to
the
door.
She
did
not
like
scenes;
she
dreaded
them
as
all
timid
people
do.
She
said
falteringly,
"Come
in,
my
dear."
Shirley
did
come
in
with
some
impetuosity.
She
threw
her
arms
round
her
governess,
and
while
she
kissed
her
heartily
she
said,
"You
know
you
must
forgive
me,
Mrs.
Pryor.
I
could
not
get
on
at
all
if
there
was
a
misunderstanding
between
you
and
me."
"I
have
nothing
to
forgive,"
was
the
reply.
"We
will
pass
it
over
now,
if
you
please.
The
final
result
of
the
incident
is
that
it
proves
more
plainly
than
ever
how
unequal
I
am
to
certain
crises."
And
that
was
the
painful
feeling
