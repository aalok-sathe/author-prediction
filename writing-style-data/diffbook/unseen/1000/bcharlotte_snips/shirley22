their
decayed
family,
the
persons
of
both
were
almost
sacred
in
her
eyes.
Of
Louis,
however,
she
knew
less
than
of
Robert.
He
had
been
sent
to
England
when
a
mere
boy,
and
had
received
his
education
at
an
English
school.
His
education
not
being
such
as
to
adapt
him
for
trade,
perhaps,
too,
his
natural
bent
not
inclining
him
to
mercantile
pursuits,
he
had,
when
the
blight
of
hereditary
prospects
rendered
it
necessary
for
him
to
push
his
own
fortune,
adopted
the
very
arduous
and
very
modest
career
of
a
teacher.
He
had
been
usher
in
a
school,
and
was
said
now
to
be
tutor
in
a
private
family.
Hortense,
when
she
mentioned
Louis,
described
him
as
having
what
she
called
"des
moyens,"
but
as
being
too
backward
and
quiet.
Her
praise
of
Robert
was
in
a
different
strain,
less
qualified:
she
was
very
proud
of
him;
she
regarded
him
as
the
greatest
man
in
Europe;
all
he
said
and
did
was
remarkable
in
her
eyes,
and
she
expected
others
to
behold
him
from
the
same
point
of
view;
nothing
could
be
more
irrational,
monstrous,
and
infamous
than
opposition
from
any
quarter
to
Robert,
unless
it
were
opposition
to
herself.
Accordingly,
as
soon
as
the
said
Robert
was
seated
at
the
breakfast
table,
and
she
had
helped
him
to
a
portion
of
stewed
pears,
and
cut
him
a
good
sized
Belgian
tartine,
she
began
to
pour
out
a
flood
of
amazement
and
horror
at
the
transaction
of
last
night,
the
destruction
of
the
frames.
"Quelle
idee!
to
destroy
them.
Quelle
action
honteuse!
On
voyait
bien
que
les
ouvriers
de
ce
pays
etaient
a
la
fois
betes
et
mechants.
C'etait
absolument
comme
les
domestiques
anglais,
les
servantes
surtout:
rien
d'insupportable
comme
cette
Sara,
par
exemple!"
"She
looks
clean
and
industrious,"
Mr.
Moore
remarked.
"Looks!
I
don't
know
how
she
looks,
and
I
do
not
say
that
she
is
altogether
dirty
or
idle,
mais
elle
est
d'une
insolence!
She
disputed
with
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
yesterday
about
the
cooking
of
the
beef;
she
said
I
boiled
it
to
rags,
that
English
people
would
never
be
able
to
eat
such
a
dish
as
our
bouilli,
that
the
bouillon
was
no
better
than
greasy
warm
water,
and
as
to
the
choucroute,
she
affirms
she
cannot
touch
it!
That
barrel
we
have
in
the
cellar
delightfully
prepared
by
my
own
hands
she
termed
a
tub
of
hog
wash,
which
means
food
for
pigs.
I
am
harassed
with
the
girl,
and
yet
I
cannot
part
with
her
lest
I
should
get
a
worse.
You
are
in
the
same
position
with
your
workmen,
pauvre
cher
frere!"
"I
am
afraid
you
are
not
very
happy
in
England,
Hortense."
"It
is
my
duty
to
be
happy
where
you
are,
brother;
but
otherwise
there
are
certainly
a
thousand
things
which
make
me
regret
our
native
town.
All
the
world
here
appears
to
me
ill
bred
(mal
eleve).
I
find
my
habits
considered
ridiculous.
If
a
girl
out
of
your
mill
chances
to
come
into
the
kitchen
and
find
me
in
my
jupon
and
camisole
preparing
dinner
(for
you
know
I
cannot
trust
Sarah
to
cook
a
single
dish),
she
sneers.
If
I
accept
an
invitation
out
to
tea,
which
I
have
done
once
or
twice,
I
perceive
I
am
put
quite
into
the
background;
I
have
not
that
attention
paid
me
which
decidedly
is
my
due.
Of
what
an
excellent
family
are
the
Gerards,
as
we
know,
and
the
Moores
also!
They
have
a
right
to
claim
a
certain
respect,
and
to
feel
wounded
when
it
is
withheld
from
them.
In
Antwerp
I
was
always
treated
with
distinction;
here,
one
would
think
that
when
I
open
my
lips
in
company
I
speak
English
with
a
ridiculous
accent,
whereas
I
am
quite
assured
that
I
pronounce
it
perfectly."
"Hortense,
in
Antwerp
we
were
known
rich;
in
England
we
were
never
known
but
poor."
"Precisely,
and
thus
mercenary
are
mankind.
Again,
dear
brother,
last
Sunday,
if
you
recollect,
was
very
wet;
accordingly
I
went
to
church
in
my
neat
black
sabots,
objects
one
would
not
indeed
wear
in
a
fashionable
city,
but
which
in
the
country
I
have
ever
been
accustomed
to
use
for
walking
in
dirty
roads.
Believe
me,
as
I
paced
up
the
aisle,
composed
and
tranquil,
as
I
am
always,
four
ladies,
and
as
many
gentlemen,
laughed
and
hid
their
faces
behind
their
prayer
books."
"Well,
well!
don't
put
on
the
sabots
again.
I
told
you
before
I
thought
they
were
not
quite
the
thing
for
this
country."
"But,
brother,
they
are
not
common
sabots,
such
as
the
peasantry
wear.
I
tell
you,
they
are
sabots
noirs,
tres
propres,
tres
convenables.
At
Mons
and
Leuze
cities
not
very
far
removed
from
the
elegant
capital
of
Brussels
it
is
very
seldom
that
the
respectable
people
wear
anything
else
for
walking
in
winter.
Let
any
one
try
to
wade
the
mud
of
the
Flemish
chaussees
in
a
pair
of
Paris
brodequins,
on
m'en
dirait
des
nouvelles!"
"Never
mind
Mons
and
Leuze
and
the
Flemish
chaussees;
do
at
Rome
as
the
Romans
do.
And
as
to
the
camisole
and
jupon,
I
am
not
quite
sure
about
them
either.
I
never
see
an
English
lady
dressed
in
such
garments.
Ask
Caroline
Helstone."
"Caroline!
I
ask
Caroline?
I
consult
her
about
my
dress?
It
is
she
who
on
all
points
should
consult
me.
She
is
a
child."
"She
is
eighteen,
or
at
least
seventeen
old
enough
to
know
all
about
gowns,
petticoats,
and
chaussures."
"Do
not
spoil
Caroline,
I
entreat
you,
brother.
Do
not
make
her
of
more
consequence
than
she
ought
to
be.
At
present
she
is
modest
and
unassuming:
let
us
keep
her
so."
"With
all
my
heart.
Is
she
coming
this
morning?"
"She
will
come
at
ten,
as
usual,
to
take
her
French
lesson."
"You
don't
find
that
she
sneers
at
you,
do
you?"
"She
does
not.
She
appreciates
me
better
than
any
one
else
here;
but
then
