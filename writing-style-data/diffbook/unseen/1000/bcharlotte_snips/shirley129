ere
long
to
produce
mortal
effects
on
my
constitution.
I
sickened.
The
lady
of
the
house
told
me
coolly
I
was
the
victim
of
'wounded
vanity.'
She
hinted
that
if
I
did
not
make
an
effort
to
quell
my
'ungodly
discontent,'
to
cease
'murmuring
against
God's
appointment,'
and
to
cultivate
the
profound
humility
befitting
my
station,
my
mind
would
very
likely
'go
to
pieces'
on
the
rock
that
wrecked
most
of
my
sisterhood
morbid
self
esteem
and
that
I
should
die
an
inmate
of
a
lunatic
asylum.
"I
said
nothing
to
Mrs.
Hardman
it
would
have
been
useless;
but
to
her
eldest
daughter
I
one
day
dropped
a
few
observations,
which
were
answered
thus.
There
were
hardships,
she
allowed,
in
the
position
of
a
governess.
'Doubtless
they
had
their
trials;
but,'
she
averred,
with
a
manner
it
makes
me
smile
now
to
recall
'but
it
must
be
so.
She'
(Miss
H.)
'had
neither
view,
hope,
nor
wish
to
see
these
things
remedied;
for
in
the
inherent
constitution
of
English
habits,
feelings,
and
prejudices
there
was
no
possibility
that
they
should
be.
Governesses,'
she
observed,
'must
ever
be
kept
in
a
sort
of
isolation.
It
is
the
only
means
of
maintaining
that
distance
which
the
reserve
of
English
manners
and
the
decorum
of
English
families
exact.'
"I
remember
I
sighed
as
Miss
Hardman
quitted
my
bedside.
She
caught
the
sound,
and
turning,
said
severely,
'I
fear,
Miss
Grey,
you
have
inherited
in
fullest
measure
the
worst
sin
of
our
fallen
nature
the
sin
of
pride.
You
are
proud,
and
therefore
you
are
ungrateful
too.
Mamma
pays
you
a
handsome
salary,
and
if
you
had
average
sense
you
would
thankfully
put
up
with
much
that
is
fatiguing
to
do
and
irksome
to
bear,
since
it
is
so
well
made
worth
your
while.'
"Miss
Hardman,
my
love,
was
a
very
strong
minded
young
lady,
of
most
distinguished
talents.
The
aristocracy
are
decidedly
a
very
superior
class,
you
know,
both
physically,
and
morally,
and
mentally;
as
a
high
Tory
I
acknowledge
that.
I
could
not
describe
the
dignity
of
her
voice
and
mien
as
she
addressed
me
thus;
still,
I
fear
she
was
selfish,
my
dear.
I
would
never
wish
to
speak
ill
of
my
superiors
in
rank,
but
I
think
she
was
a
little
selfish."
"I
remember,"
continued
Mrs.
Pryor,
after
a
pause,
"another
of
Miss
H.'s
observations,
which
she
would
utter
with
quite
a
grand
air.
'WE,'
she
would
say
'WE
need
the
imprudences,
extravagances,
mistakes,
and
crimes
of
a
certain
number
of
fathers
to
sow
the
seed
from
which
WE
reap
the
harvest
of
governesses.
The
daughters
of
trades
people,
however
well
educated,
must
necessarily
be
underbred,
and
as
such
unfit
to
be
inmates
of
OUR
dwellings,
or
guardians
of
OUR
children's
minds
and
persons.
WE
shall
ever
prefer
to
place
those
about
OUR
offspring
who
have
been
born
and
bred
with
somewhat
of
the
same
refinement
as
OURSELVES.'"
"Miss
Hardman
must
have
thought
herself
something
better
than
her
fellow
creatures,
ma'am,
since
she
held
that
their
calamities,
and
even
crimes,
were
necessary
to
minister
to
her
convenience.
You
say
she
was
religious.
Her
religion
must
have
been
that
of
the
Pharisee
who
thanked
God
that
he
was
not
as
other
men
are,
nor
even
as
that
publican."
"My
dear,
we
will
not
discuss
the
point.
I
should
be
the
last
person
to
wish
to
instil
into
your
mind
any
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
with
your
lot
in
life,
or
any
sentiment
of
envy
or
insubordination
towards
your
superiors.
Implicit
submission
to
authorities,
scrupulous
deference
to
our
betters
(under
which
term
I,
of
course,
include
the
higher
classes
of
society),
are,
in
my
opinion,
indispensable
to
the
well
being
of
every
community.
All
I
mean
to
say,
my
dear,
is
that
you
had
better
not
attempt
to
be
a
governess,
as
the
duties
of
the
position
would
be
too
severe
for
your
constitution.
Not
one
word
of
disrespect
would
I
breathe
towards
either
Mrs.
or
Miss
Hardman;
only,
recalling
my
own
experience,
I
cannot
but
feel
that,
were
you
to
fall
under
auspices
such
as
theirs,
you
would
contend
a
while
courageously
with
your
doom,
then
you
would
pine
and
grow
too
weak
for
your
work;
you
would
come
home
if
you
still
had
a
home
broken
down.
Those
languishing
years
would
follow
of
which
none
but
the
invalid
and
her
immediate
friends
feel
the
heart
sickness
and
know
the
burden.
Consumption
or
decline
would
close
the
chapter.
Such
is
the
history
of
many
a
life.
I
would
not
have
it
yours.
My
dear,
we
will
now
walk
about
a
little,
if
you
please."
They
both
rose,
and
slowly
paced
a
green
natural
terrace
bordering
the
chasm.
"My
dear,"
ere
long
again
began
Mrs.
Pryor,
a
sort
of
timid,
embarrassed
abruptness
marking
her
manner
as
she
spoke,
"the
young,
especially
those
to
whom
nature
has
been
favourable,
often
frequently
anticipate
look
forward
to
to
marriage
as
the
end,
the
goal
of
their
hopes."
And
she
stopped.
Caroline
came
to
her
relief
with
promptitude,
showing
a
great
deal
more
self
possession
and
courage
than
herself
on
the
formidable
topic
now
broached.
"They
do,
and
naturally,"
she
replied,
with
a
calm
emphasis
that
startled
Mrs.
Pryor.
"They
look
forward
to
marriage
with
some
one
they
love
as
the
brightest,
the
only
bright
destiny
that
can
await
them.
Are
they
wrong?"
"Oh,
my
dear!"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Pryor,
clasping
her
hands;
and
again
she
paused.
Caroline
turned
a
searching,
an
eager
eye
on
the
face
of
her
friend:
that
face
was
much
agitated.
"My
dear,"
she
murmured,
"life
is
an
illusion."
"But
not
love!
Love
is
real
the
most
real,
the
most
lasting,
the
sweetest
and
yet
the
bitterest
thing
we
know."
"My
dear,
it
is
very
bitter.
It
is
said
to
be
strong
strong
as
death!
Most
of
the
cheats
of
existence
are
strong.
As
to
their
sweetness,
nothing
is
so
transitory;
its
date
is
a
moment,
the
twinkling
of
an
eye.
The
sting
remains
