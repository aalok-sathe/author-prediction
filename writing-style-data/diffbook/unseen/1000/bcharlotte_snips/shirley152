miserly;
and
yet
you
are
not,
for
you
give
liberally
to
the
poor
and
to
religious
societies
though
your
gifts
are
conveyed
so
secretly
and
quietly
that
they
are
known
to
few
except
the
receivers.
But
I
will
be
your
lady's
maid
myself.
When
I
get
a
little
stronger
I
will
set
to
work,
and
you
must
be
good,
mamma,
and
do
as
I
bid
you."
And
Caroline,
sitting
near
her
mother,
rearranged
her
muslin
handkerchief
and
resmoothed
her
hair.
"My
own
mamma,"
then
she
went
on,
as
if
pleasing
herself
with
the
thought
of
their
relationship,
"who
belongs
to
me,
and
to
whom
I
belong!
I
am
a
rich
girl
now.
I
have
something
I
can
love
well,
and
not
be
afraid
of
loving.
Mamma,
who
gave
you
this
little
brooch?
Let
me
unpin
it
and
look
at
it."
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
usually
shrank
from
meddling
fingers
and
near
approach,
allowed
the
license
complacently.
"Did
papa
give
you
this,
mamma?"
"My
sister
gave
it
me
my
only
sister,
Cary.
Would
that
your
Aunt
Caroline
had
lived
to
see
her
niece!"
"Have
you
nothing
of
papa's
no
trinket,
no
gift
of
his?"
"I
have
one
thing."
"That
you
prize?"
"That
I
prize."
"Valuable
and
pretty?"
"Invaluable
and
sweet
to
me."
"Show
it,
mamma.
Is
it
here
or
at
Fieldhead?"
"It
is
talking
to
me
now,
leaning
on
me.
Its
arms
are
round
me."
"Ah,
mamma,
you
mean
your
teasing
daughter,
who
will
never
let
you
alone;
who,
when
you
go
into
your
room,
cannot
help
running
to
seek
for
you;
who
follows
you
upstairs
and
down,
like
a
dog."
"Whose
features
still
give
me
such
a
strange
thrill
sometimes.
I
half
fear
your
fair
looks
yet,
child."
"You
don't;
you
can't.
Mamma,
I
am
sorry
papa
was
not
good.
I
do
so
wish
he
had
been.
Wickedness
spoils
and
poisons
all
pleasant
things.
It
kills
love.
If
you
and
I
thought
each
other
wicked,
we
could
not
love
each
other,
could
we?"
"And
if
we
could
not
trust
each
other,
Cary?"
"How
miserable
we
should
be!
Mother,
before
I
knew
you
I
had
an
apprehension
that
you
were
not
good
that
I
could
not
esteem
you.
That
dread
damped
my
wish
to
see
you.
And
now
my
heart
is
elate
because
I
find
you
perfect
almost;
kind,
clever,
nice.
Your
sole
fault
is
that
you
are
old
fashioned,
and
of
that
I
shall
cure
you.
Mamma,
put
your
work
down;
read
to
me.
I
like
your
southern
accent;
it
is
so
pure,
so
soft.
It
has
no
rugged
burr,
no
nasal
twang,
such
as
almost
every
one's
voice
here
in
the
north
has.
My
uncle
and
Mr.
Hall
say
that
you
are
a
fine
reader,
mamma.
Mr.
Hall
said
he
never
heard
any
lady
read
with
such
propriety
of
expression
or
purity
of
accent."
"I
wish
I
could
reciprocate
the
compliment,
Cary;
but,
really,
the
first
time
I
heard
your
truly
excellent
friend
read
and
preach
I
could
not
understand
his
broad
northern
tongue."
"Could
you
understand
me,
mamma?
Did
I
seem
to
speak
roughly?"
"No.
I
almost
wished
you
had,
as
I
wished
you
had
looked
unpolished.
Your
father,
Caroline,
naturally
spoke
well,
quite
otherwise
than
your
worthy
uncle
correctly,
gently,
smoothly.
You
inherit
the
gift."
"Poor
papa!
When
he
was
so
agreeable,
why
was
he
not
good?"
"Why
he
was
as
he
was
and
happily
of
that
you,
child,
can
form
no
conception
I
cannot
tell.
It
is
a
deep
mystery.
The
key
is
in
the
hands
of
his
Maker.
There
I
leave
it."
"Mamma,
you
will
keep
stitching,
stitching
away.
Put
down
the
sewing;
I
am
an
enemy
to
it.
It
cumbers
your
lap,
and
I
want
it
for
my
head;
it
engages
your
eyes,
and
I
want
them
for
a
book.
Here
is
your
favourite
Cowper."
These
importunities
were
the
mother's
pleasure.
If
ever
she
delayed
compliance,
it
was
only
to
hear
them
repeated,
and
to
enjoy
her
child's
soft,
half
playful,
half
petulant
urgency.
And
then,
when
she
yielded,
Caroline
would
say
archly,
"You
will
spoil
me,
mamma.
I
always
thought
I
should
like
to
be
spoiled,
and
I
find
it
very
sweet."
So
did
Mrs.
Pryor.
By
the
time
the
Fieldhead
party
returned
to
Briarfield
Caroline
was
nearly
well.
Miss
Keeldar,
who
had
received
news
by
post
of
her
friend's
convalescence,
hardly
suffered
an
hour
to
elapse
between
her
arrival
at
home
and
her
first
call
at
the
rectory.
A
shower
of
rain
was
falling
gently,
yet
fast,
on
the
late
flowers
and
russet
autumn
shrubs,
when
the
garden
wicket
was
heard
to
swing
open,
and
Shirley's
well
known
form
passed
the
window.
On
her
entrance
her
feelings
were
evinced
in
her
own
peculiar
fashion.
When
deeply
moved
by
serious
fears
or
joys
she
was
not
garrulous.
The
strong
emotion
was
rarely
suffered
to
influence
her
tongue,
and
even
her
eye
refused
it
more
than
a
furtive
and
fitful
conquest.
She
took
Caroline
in
her
arms,
gave
her
one
look,
one
kiss,
then
said,
"You
are
better."
And
a
minute
after,
"I
see
you
are
safe
now;
but
take
care.
God
grant
your
health
may
be
called
on
to
sustain
no
more
shocks!"
She
proceeded
to
talk
fluently
about
the
journey.
In
the
midst
of
vivacious
discourse
her
eye
still
wandered
to
Caroline.
There
spoke
in
its
light
a
deep
solicitude,
some
trouble,
and
some
amaze.
"She
may
be
better,"
it
said,
"but
how
weak
she
still
is!
What
peril
she
has
come
through!"
Suddenly
her
glance
reverted
to
Mrs.
Pryor.
It
pierced
her
through.
"When
will
my
governess
return
to
me?"
she
asked.
"May
I
tell
her
all?"
demanded
Caroline
of
her
mother.
Leave
being
signified
by
a
gesture,
Shirley
was
presently
enlightened
on
what
had
happened
in
her
absence.
"Very
good,"
was
the
cool
comment
"very
good!
But
it
is
no
news
to
me."
"What!
did
you
know?"
"I
guessed
long
since
the
whole
business.
I
have
heard
somewhat
of
Mrs.
Pryor's
