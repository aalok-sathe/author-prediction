would
be,
had
opened
the
piano,
and
produced
music
books
in
readiness),
music
was
asked
for.
This
was
Mr.
Sweeting's
chance
for
showing
off.
He
was
eager
to
commence.
He
undertook,
therefore,
the
arduous
task
of
persuading
the
young
ladies
to
favour
the
company
with
an
air
a
song.
Con
amore
he
went
through
the
whole
business
of
begging,
praying,
resisting
excuses,
explaining
away
difficulties,
and
at
last
succeeded
in
persuading
Miss
Harriet
to
allow
herself
to
be
led
to
the
instrument.
Then
out
came
the
pieces
of
his
flute
(he
always
carried
them
in
his
pocket,
as
unfailingly
as
he
carried
his
handkerchief).
They
were
screwed
and
arranged,
Malone
and
Donne
meanwhile
herding
together
and
sneering
at
him,
which
the
little
man,
glancing
over
his
shoulder,
saw,
but
did
not
heed
at
all.
He
was
persuaded
their
sarcasm
all
arose
from
envy.
They
could
not
accompany
the
ladies
as
he
could;
he
was
about
to
enjoy
a
triumph
over
them.
The
triumph
began.
Malone,
much
chagrined
at
hearing
him
pipe
up
in
most
superior
style,
determined
to
earn
distinction
too,
if
possible,
and
all
at
once
assuming
the
character
of
a
swain
(which
character
he
had
endeavoured
to
enact
once
or
twice
before,
but
in
which
he
had
not
hitherto
met
with
the
success
he
doubtless
opined
his
merits
deserved),
approached
a
sofa
on
which
Miss
Helstone
was
seated,
and
depositing
his
great
Irish
frame
near
her,
tried
his
hand
(or
rather
tongue)
at
a
fine
speech
or
two,
accompanied
by
grins
the
most
extraordinary
and
incomprehensible.
In
the
course
of
his
efforts
to
render
himself
agreeable,
he
contrived
to
possess
himself
of
the
two
long
sofa
cushions
and
a
square
one;
with
which,
after
rolling
them
about
for
some
time
with
strange
gestures,
he
managed
to
erect
a
sort
of
barrier
between
himself
and
the
object
of
his
attentions.
Caroline,
quite
willing
that
they
should
be
sundered,
soon
devised
an
excuse
for
stepping
over
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
room,
and
taking
up
a
position
beside
Mrs.
Sykes,
of
which
good
lady
she
entreated
some
instruction
in
a
new
stitch
in
ornamental
knitting,
a
favour
readily
granted;
and
thus
Peter
Augustus
was
thrown
out.
Very
sullenly
did
his
countenance
lower
when
he
saw
himself
abandoned
left
entirely
to
his
own
resources,
on
a
large
sofa,
with
the
charge
of
three
small
cushions
on
his
hands.
The
fact
was,
he
felt
disposed
seriously
to
cultivate
acquaintance
with
Miss
Helstone,
because
he
thought,
in
common
with
others,
that
her
uncle
possessed
money,
and
concluded
that,
since
he
had
no
children,
he
would
probably
leave
it
to
his
niece.
Gerard
Moore
was
better
instructed
on
this
point:
he
had
seen
the
neat
church
that
owed
its
origin
to
the
rector's
zeal
and
cash,
and
more
than
once,
in
his
inmost
soul,
had
cursed
an
expensive
caprice
which
crossed
his
wishes.
The
evening
seemed
long
to
one
person
in
that
room.
Caroline
at
intervals
dropped
her
knitting
on
her
lap,
and
gave
herself
up
to
a
sort
of
brain
lethargy
closing
her
eyes
and
depressing
her
head
caused
by
what
seemed
to
her
the
unmeaning
hum
around
her,
the
inharmonious,
tasteless
rattle
of
the
piano
keys,
the
squeaking
and
gasping
notes
of
the
flute,
the
laughter
and
mirth
of
her
uncle,
and
Hannah,
and
Mary,
she
could
not
tell
whence
originating,
for
she
heard
nothing
comic
or
gleeful
in
their
discourse;
and
more
than
all,
by
the
interminable
gossip
of
Mrs.
Sykes
murmured
close
at
her
ear,
gossip
which
rang
the
changes
on
four
subjects
her
own
health
and
that
of
the
various
members
of
her
family;
the
missionary
and
Jew
baskets
and
their
contents;
the
late
meeting
at
Nunnely,
and
one
which
was
expected
to
come
off
next
week
at
Whinbury.
Tired
at
length
to
exhaustion,
she
embraced
the
opportunity
of
Mr.
Sweeting
coming
up
to
speak
to
Mrs.
Sykes
to
slip
quietly
out
of
the
apartment,
and
seek
a
moment's
respite
in
solitude.
She
repaired
to
the
dining
room,
where
the
clear
but
now
low
remnant
of
a
fire
still
burned
in
the
grate.
The
place
was
empty
and
quiet,
glasses
and
decanters
were
cleared
from
the
table,
the
chairs
were
put
back
in
their
places,
all
was
orderly.
Caroline
sank
into
her
uncle's
large
easy
chair,
half
shut
her
eyes,
and
rested
herself
rested
at
least
her
limbs,
her
senses,
her
hearing,
her
vision
weary
with
listening
to
nothing,
and
gazing
on
vacancy.
As
to
her
mind,
that
flew
directly
to
the
Hollow.
It
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
parlour
there,
then
it
passed
to
the
counting
house,
and
wondered
which
spot
was
blessed
by
the
presence
of
Robert.
It
so
happened
that
neither
locality
had
that
honour;
for
Robert
was
half
a
mile
away
from
both,
and
much
nearer
to
Caroline
than
her
deadened
spirit
suspected.
He
was
at
this
moment
crossing
the
churchyard,
approaching
the
rectory
garden
gate
not,
however,
coming
to
see
his
cousin,
but
intent
solely
on
communicating
a
brief
piece
of
intelligence
to
the
rector.
Yes,
Caroline;
you
hear
the
wire
of
the
bell
vibrate;
it
rings
again
for
the
fifth
time
this
afternoon.
You
start,
and
you
are
certain
now
that
this
must
be
he
of
whom
you
dream.
Why
you
are
so
certain
you
cannot
explain
to
yourself,
but
you
know
it.
You
lean
forward,
listening
eagerly
as
Fanny
opens
the
door.
Right!
That
is
the
voice
low,
with
the
slight
foreign
accent,
but
so
sweet,
as
you
fancy.
You
half
rise.
"Fanny
will
tell
him
Mr.
Helstone
is
with
company,
and
then
he
will
go
away."
Oh!
she
cannot
let
him
go.
In
spite
of
herself,
in
spite
of
her
reason,
she
walks
half
across
the
room;
she
stands
ready
to
dart
out
in
case
the
step
should
retreat;
but
he
enters
the
passage.
"Since
your
master
is
engaged,"
he
says,
"just
show
me
into
the
dining
room.
Bring
me
pen
and
ink.
I
will
write
a
short
note
