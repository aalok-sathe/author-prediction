He
would
have
shown
some
token
of
affection.
In
his
eye,
on
his
lips,
I
should
have
read
comfort;
but
the
chance
is
lost.
The
wind,
the
cloud's
shadow,
does
not
pass
more
silently,
more
emptily
than
he.
I
have
been
mocked,
and
Heaven
is
cruel!"
Thus,
in
the
utter
sickness
of
longing
and
disappointment,
she
went
home.
The
next
morning
at
breakfast,
where
she
appeared
white
cheeked
and
miserable
looking
as
one
who
had
seen
a
ghost,
she
inquired
of
Mr.
Helstone,
"Have
you
any
objection,
uncle,
to
my
inquiring
for
a
situation
in
a
family?"
Her
uncle,
ignorant
as
the
table
supporting
his
coffee
cup
of
all
his
niece
had
undergone
and
was
undergoing,
scarcely
believed
his
ears.
"What
whim
now?"
he
asked.
"Are
you
bewitched?
What
can
you
mean?"
"I
am
not
well,
and
need
a
change,"
she
said.
He
examined
her.
He
discovered
she
had
experienced
a
change,
at
any
rate.
Without
his
being
aware
of
it,
the
rose
had
dwindled
and
faded
to
a
mere
snowdrop;
bloom
had
vanished,
flesh
wasted;
she
sat
before
him
drooping,
colourless,
and
thin.
But
for
the
soft
expression
of
her
brown
eyes,
the
delicate
lines
of
her
features,
and
the
flowing
abundance
of
her
hair,
she
would
no
longer
have
possessed
a
claim
to
the
epithet
pretty.
"What
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
you?"
he
asked.
"What
is
wrong?
How
are
you
ailing?"
No
answer;
only
the
brown
eyes
filled,
the
faintly
tinted
lips
trembled.
"Look
out
for
a
situation,
indeed!
For
what
situation
are
you
fit?
What
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself?
You
are
not
well."
"I
should
be
well
if
I
went
from
home."
"These
women
are
incomprehensible.
They
have
the
strangest
knack
of
startling
you
with
unpleasant
surprises.
To
day
you
see
them
bouncing,
buxom,
red
as
cherries,
and
round
as
apples;
to
morrow
they
exhibit
themselves
effete
as
dead
weeds,
blanched
and
broken
down.
And
the
reason
of
it
all?
That's
the
puzzle.
She
has
her
meals,
her
liberty,
a
good
house
to
live
in,
and
good
clothes
to
wear,
as
usual.
A
while
since
that
sufficed
to
keep
her
handsome
and
cheery,
and
there
she
sits
now
a
poor,
little,
pale,
puling
chit
enough.
Provoking!
Then
comes
the
question,
What
is
to
be
done?
I
suppose
I
must
send
for
advice.
Will
you
have
a
doctor,
child?"
"No,
uncle,
I
don't
want
one.
A
doctor
could
do
me
no
good.
I
merely
want
change
of
air
and
scene."
"Well,
if
that
be
the
caprice,
it
shall
be
gratified.
You
shall
go
to
a
watering
place.
I
don't
mind
the
expense.
Fanny
shall
accompany
you."
"But,
uncle,
some
day
I
must
do
something
for
myself;
I
have
no
fortune.
I
had
better
begin
now."
"While
I
live,
you
shall
not
turn
out
as
a
governess,
Caroline.
I
will
not
have
it
said
that
my
niece
is
a
governess."
"But
the
later
in
life
one
makes
a
change
of
that
sort,
uncle,
the
more
difficult
and
painful
it
is.
I
should
wish
to
get
accustomed
to
the
yoke
before
any
habits
of
ease
and
independence
are
formed."
"I
beg
you
will
not
harass
me,
Caroline.
I
mean
to
provide
for
you.
I
have
always
meant
to
provide
for
you.
I
will
purchase
an
annuity.
Bless
me!
I
am
but
fifty
five;
my
health
and
constitution
are
excellent.
There
is
plenty
of
time
to
save
and
take
measures.
Don't
make
yourself
anxious
respecting
the
future.
Is
that
what
frets
you?"
"No,
uncle;
but
I
long
for
a
change."
He
laughed.
"There
speaks
the
woman!"
cried
he,
"the
very
woman!
A
change!
a
change!
Always
fantastical
and
whimsical!
Well,
it's
in
her
sex."
"But
it
is
not
fantasy
and
whim,
uncle."
"What
is
it
then?"
"Necessity,
I
think.
I
feel
weaker
than
formerly.
I
believe
I
should
have
more
to
do."
"Admirable!
She
feels
weak,
and
therefore
she
should
be
set
to
hard
labour
'clair
comme
le
jour,'
as
Moore
confound
Moore!
You
shall
go
to
Cliff
Bridge;
and
there
are
two
guineas
to
buy
a
new
frock.
Come,
Cary,
never
fear.
We'll
find
balm
in
Gilead."
"Uncle,
I
wish
you
were
less
generous
and
more
"
"More
what?"
Sympathizing
was
the
word
on
Caroline's
lips,
but
it
was
not
uttered.
She
checked
herself
in
time.
Her
uncle
would
indeed
have
laughed
if
that
namby
pamby
word
had
escaped
her.
Finding
her
silent,
he
said,
"The
fact
is,
you
don't
know
precisely
what
you
want."
"Only
to
be
a
governess."
"Pooh!
mere
nonsense!
I'll
not
hear
of
governessing.
Don't
mention
it
again.
It
is
rather
too
feminine
a
fancy.
I
have
finished
breakfast.
Ring
the
bell.
Put
all
crotchets
out
of
your
head,
and
run
away
and
amuse
yourself."
"What
with?
My
doll?"
asked
Caroline
to
herself
as
she
quitted
the
room.
A
week
or
two
passed;
her
bodily
and
mental
health
neither
grew
worse
nor
better.
She
was
now
precisely
in
that
state
when,
if
her
constitution
had
contained
the
seeds
of
consumption,
decline,
or
slow
fever,
those
diseases
would
have
been
rapidly
developed,
and
would
soon
have
carried
her
quietly
from
the
world.
People
never
die
of
love
or
grief
alone,
though
some
die
of
inherent
maladies
which
the
tortures
of
those
passions
prematurely
force
into
destructive
action.
The
sound
by
nature
undergo
these
tortures,
and
are
racked,
shaken,
shattered;
their
beauty
and
bloom
perish,
but
life
remains
untouched.
They
are
brought
to
a
certain
point
of
dilapidation;
they
are
reduced
to
pallor,
debility,
and
emaciation.
People
think,
as
they
see
them
gliding
languidly
about,
that
they
will
soon
withdraw
to
sick
beds,
perish
there,
and
cease
from
among
the
healthy
and
happy.
This
does
not
happen.
They
live
on;
and
though
they
cannot
regain
youth
and
gaiety,
they
may
regain
strength
and
serenity.
The
blossom
which
the
March
wind
nips,
but
fails
to
sweep
away,
may
survive
to
hang
a
withered
apple
on
the
tree
late
into
autumn:
having
braved
the
last
frosts
