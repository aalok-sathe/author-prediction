or
sing
the
very
songs
you
have
caught
up
by
ear
from
my
voice.
I
do
not
ask
whence
flows
the
feeling
which
you
pour
into
these
songs,
for
I
know
it
flows
out
of
your
heart,
Miss
Keeldar.
In
the
winter
evenings
Tartar
lies
at
your
feet.
You
suffer
him
to
rest
his
head
on
your
perfumed
lap;
you
let
him
couch
on
the
borders
of
your
satin
raiment.
His
rough
hide
is
familiar
with
the
contact
of
your
hand.
I
once
saw
you
kiss
him
on
that
snow
white
beauty
spot
which
stars
his
broad
forehead.
It
is
dangerous
to
say
I
am
like
Tartar;
it
suggests
to
me
a
claim
to
be
treated
like
Tartar.'
"'Perhaps,
sir,
you
can
extort
as
much
from
your
penniless
and
friendless
young
orphan
girl,
when
you
find
her.'
"'Oh
could
I
find
her
such
as
I
image
her!
Something
to
tame
first,
and
teach
afterwards;
to
break
in,
and
then
to
fondle.
To
lift
the
destitute
proud
thing
out
of
poverty;
to
establish
power
over
and
then
to
be
indulgent
to
the
capricious
moods
that
never
were
influenced
and
never
indulged
before;
to
see
her
alternately
irritated
and
subdued
about
twelve
times
in
the
twenty
four
hours;
and
perhaps,
eventually,
when
her
training
was
accomplished,
to
behold
her
the
exemplary
and
patient
mother
of
about
a
dozen
children,
only
now
and
then
lending
little
Louis
a
cordial
cuff
by
way
of
paying
the
interest
of
the
vast
debt
she
owes
his
father.
Oh'
(I
went
on),
'my
orphan
girl
would
give
me
many
a
kiss;
she
would
watch
on
the
threshold
for
my
coming
home
of
an
evening;
she
would
run
into
my
arms;
she
would
keep
my
hearth
as
bright
as
she
would
make
it
warm.
God
bless
the
sweet
idea!
Find
her
I
must.'
"Her
eyes
emitted
an
eager
flash,
her
lips
opened;
but
she
reclosed
them,
and
impetuously
turned
away.
"'Tell
me,
tell
me
where
she
is,
Miss
Keeldar!'
"Another
movement,
all
haughtiness
and
fire
and
impulse.
"'I
must
know.
You
can
tell
me;
you
shall
tell
me.'
"'I
never
will.'
"She
turned
to
leave
me.
Could
I
now
let
her
part
as
she
had
always
parted
from
me?
No.
I
had
gone
too
far
not
to
finish;
I
had
come
too
near
the
end
not
to
drive
home
to
it.
All
the
encumbrance
of
doubt,
all
the
rubbish
of
indecision,
must
be
removed
at
once,
and
the
plain
truth
must
be
ascertained.
She
must
take
her
part,
and
tell
me
what
it
was;
I
must
take
mine
and
adhere
to
it.
"'A
minute,
madam,'
I
said,
keeping
my
hand
on
the
door
handle
before
I
opened
it.
'We
have
had
a
long
conversation
this
morning,
but
the
last
word
has
not
been
spoken
yet.
It
is
yours
to
speak
it.'
"'May
I
pass?'
"'No;
I
guard
the
door.
I
would
almost
rather
die
than
let
you
leave
me
just
now,
without
speaking
the
word
I
demand.'
"'What
dare
you
expect
me
to
say?'
"'What
I
am
dying
and
perishing
to
hear;
what
I
must
and
will
hear;
what
you
dare
not
now
suppress.'
"'Mr.
Moore,
I
hardly
know
what
you
mean.
You
are
not
like
yourself.'
"I
suppose
I
hardly
was
like
my
usual
self,
for
I
scared
her
that
I
could
see.
It
was
right:
she
must
be
scared
to
be
won.
"'You
do
know
what
I
mean,
and
for
the
first
time
I
stand
before
you
myself.
I
have
flung
off
the
tutor,
and
beg
to
introduce
you
to
the
man.
And
remember,
he
is
a
gentleman.'
"She
trembled.
She
put
her
hand
to
mine
as
if
to
remove
it
from
the
lock.
She
might
as
well
have
tried
to
loosen,
by
her
soft
touch,
metal
welded
to
metal.
She
felt
she
was
powerless,
and
receded;
and
again
she
trembled.
"What
change
I
underwent
I
cannot
explain,
but
out
of
her
emotion
passed
into
me
a
new
spirit.
I
neither
was
crushed
nor
elated
by
her
lands
and
gold;
I
thought
not
of
them,
cared
not
for
them.
They
were
nothing
dross
that
could
not
dismay
me.
I
saw
only
herself
her
young
beautiful
form,
the
grace,
the
majesty,
the
modesty
of
her
girlhood.
"'My
pupil,'
I
said.
"'My
master,'
was
the
low
answer.
"'I
have
a
thing
to
tell
you.'
"She
waited
with
declined
brow
and
ringlets
drooped.
"'I
have
to
tell
you
that
for
four
years
you
have
been
growing
into
your
tutor's
heart,
and
that
you
are
rooted
there
now.
I
have
to
declare
that
you
have
bewitched
me,
in
spite
of
sense,
and
experience,
and
difference
of
station
and
estate.
You
have
so
looked,
and
spoken,
and
moved;
so
shown
me
your
faults
and
your
virtues
beauties
rather,
they
are
hardly
so
stern
as
virtues
that
I
love
you
love
you
with
my
life
and
strength.
It
is
out
now.'
"She
sought
what
to
say,
but
could
not
find
a
word.
She
tried
to
rally,
but
vainly.
I
passionately
repeated
that
I
loved
her.
"'Well,
Mr.
Moore,
what
then?'
was
the
answer
I
got,
uttered
in
a
tone
that
would
have
been
petulant
if
it
had
not
faltered.
"'Have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me?
Have
you
no
love
for
me?'
"'A
little
bit.'
"'I
am
not
to
be
tortured.
I
will
not
even
play
at
present.'
"'I
don't
want
to
play;
I
want
to
go.'
"'I
wonder
you
dare
speak
of
going
at
this
moment.
You
go!
What!
with
my
heart
in
your
hand,
to
lay
it
on
your
toilet
and
pierce
it
with
your
pins?
From
my
presence
you
do
not
stir,
out
of
my
reach
you
do
not
stray,
till
I
receive
a
hostage
pledge
for
pledge
your
heart
for
mine.'
"'The
thing
you
want
is
mislaid
lost
some
time
since.
Let
me
go
and
seek
it.'
"'Declare
that
it
is
where
your
keys
often
are
in
my
possession.'
"'You
ought
to
know.
And
where
are
my
keys,
