a
spiritual
song
a
tall
class
of
young
women
came
quietly
in,
closing
the
procession.
Their
teacher,
having
seen
them
seated,
passed
into
the
rectory
pew.
The
French
gray
cloak
and
small
beaver
bonnet
were
known
to
Martin;
it
was
the
very
costume
his
eyes
had
ached
to
catch.
Miss
Helstone
had
not
suffered
the
storm
to
prove
an
impediment.
After
all,
she
was
come
to
church.
Martin
probably
whispered
his
satisfaction
to
his
hymn
book;
at
any
rate,
he
therewith
hid
his
face
two
minutes.
Satisfied
or
not,
he
had
time
to
get
very
angry
with
her
again
before
the
sermon
was
over.
She
had
never
once
looked
his
way;
at
least
he
had
not
been
so
lucky
as
to
encounter
a
glance.
"If,"
he
said
"if
she
takes
no
notice
of
me,
if
she
shows
I
am
not
in
her
thoughts,
I
shall
have
a
worse,
a
meaner
opinion
of
her
than
ever.
Most
despicable
would
it
be
to
come
for
the
sake
of
those
sheep
faced
Sunday
scholars,
and
not
for
my
sake
or
that
long
skeleton
Moore's."
The
sermon
found
an
end;
the
benediction
was
pronounced;
the
congregation
dispersed.
She
had
not
been
near
him.
Now,
indeed,
as
Martin
set
his
face
homeward,
he
felt
that
the
sleet
was
sharp
and
the
east
wind
cold.
His
nearest
way
lay
through
some
fields.
It
was
a
dangerous,
because
an
untrodden
way.
He
did
not
care;
he
would
take
it.
Near
the
second
stile
rose
a
clump
of
trees.
Was
that
an
umbrella
waiting
there?
Yes,
an
umbrella,
held
with
evident
difficulty
against
the
blast;
behind
it
fluttered
a
French
gray
cloak.
Martin
grinned
as
he
toiled
up
the
steep,
encumbered
field,
difficult
to
the
foot
as
a
slope
in
the
upper
realms
of
Etna.
There
was
an
inimitable
look
in
his
face
when,
having
gained
the
stile,
he
seated
himself
coolly
thereupon,
and
thus
opened
a
conference
which,
for
his
own
part,
he
was
willing
to
prolong
indefinitely.
"I
think
you
had
better
strike
a
bargain.
Exchange
me
for
Mrs.
Pryor."
"I
was
not
sure
whether
you
would
come
this
way,
Martin,
but
I
thought
I
would
run
the
chance.
There
is
no
such
thing
as
getting
a
quiet
word
spoken
in
the
church
or
churchyard."
"Will
you
agree?
make
over
Mrs.
Pryor
to
my
mother,
and
put
me
in
her
skirts?"
"As
if
I
could
understand
you!
What
puts
Mrs.
Pryor
into
your
head?"
"You
call
her
'mamma,'
don't
you?"
"She
is
my
mamma."
"Not
possible
or
so
inefficient,
so
careless
a
mamma;
I
should
make
a
five
times
better
one.
You
may
laugh.
I
have
no
objection
to
see
you
laugh.
Your
teeth
I
hate
ugly
teeth;
but
yours
are
as
pretty
as
a
pearl
necklace,
and
a
necklace
of
which
the
pearls
are
very
fair,
even,
and
well
matched
too."
"Martin,
what
now?
I
thought
the
Yorkes
never
paid
compliments?"
"They
have
not
done
till
this
generation;
but
I
feel
as
if
it
were
my
vocation
to
turn
out
a
new
variety
of
the
Yorke
species.
I
am
rather
tired
of
my
own
ancestors.
We
have
traditions
going
back
for
four
ages
tales
of
Hiram,
which
was
the
son
of
Hiram,
which
was
the
son
of
Samuel,
which
was
the
son
of
John,
which
was
the
son
of
Zerubbabel
Yorke.
All,
from
Zerubbabel
down
to
the
last
Hiram,
were
such
as
you
see
my
father.
Before
that
there
was
a
Godfrey.
We
have
his
picture;
it
hangs
in
Moore's
bedroom;
it
is
like
me.
Of
his
character
we
know
nothing;
but
I
am
sure
it
was
different
to
his
descendants.
He
has
long,
curling
dark
hair;
he
is
carefully
and
cavalierly
dressed.
Having
said
that
he
is
like
me,
I
need
not
add
that
he
is
handsome."
"You
are
not
handsome,
Martin."
"No;
but
wait
awhile
just
let
me
take
my
time.
I
mean
to
begin
from
this
day
to
cultivate,
to
polish,
and
we
shall
see."
"You
are
a
very
strange,
a
very
unaccountable
boy,
Martin.
But
don't
imagine
you
ever
will
be
handsome;
you
cannot."
"I
mean
to
try.
But
we
were
talking
about
Mrs.
Pryor.
She
must
be
the
most
unnatural
mamma
in
existence,
coolly
to
let
her
daughter
come
out
in
this
weather.
Mine
was
in
such
a
rage
because
I
would
go
to
church;
she
was
fit
to
fling
the
kitchen
brush
after
me."
"Mamma
was
very
much
concerned
about
me;
but
I
am
afraid
I
was
obstinate.
I
would
go."
"To
see
me?"
"Exactly;
I
thought
of
nothing
else.
I
greatly
feared
the
snow
would
hinder
you
from
coming.
You
don't
know
how
pleased
I
was
to
see
you
all
by
yourself
in
the
pew."
"I
came
to
fulfil
my
duty,
and
set
the
parish
a
good
example.
And
so
you
were
obstinate,
were
you?
I
should
like
to
see
you
obstinate,
I
should.
Wouldn't
I
have
you
in
good
discipline
if
I
owned
you?
Let
me
take
the
umbrella."
"I
can't
stay
two
minutes;
our
dinner
will
be
ready."
"And
so
will
ours;
and
we
have
always
a
hot
dinner
on
Sundays.
Roast
goose
to
day,
with
apple
pie
and
rice
pudding.
I
always
contrive
to
know
the
bill
of
fare.
Well,
I
like
these
things
uncommonly;
but
I'll
make
the
sacrifice,
if
you
will."
"We
have
a
cold
dinner.
My
uncle
will
allow
no
unnecessary
cooking
on
the
Sabbath.
But
I
must
return;
the
house
would
be
in
commotion
if
I
failed
to
appear."
"So
will
Briarmains,
bless
you!
I
think
I
hear
my
father
sending
out
the
overlooker
and
five
of
the
dyers,
to
look
in
six
directions
for
the
body
of
his
prodigal
son
in
the
snow;
and
my
mother
repenting
her
of
her
many
misdeeds
towards
me,
now
I
am
gone."
"Martin,
how
is
Mr.
Moore?"
"That
is
what
you
came
for,
just
to
say
that
word."
"Come,
tell
me
quickly."
"Hang
him!
he
is
no
worse;
but
as
ill
used
as
ever
