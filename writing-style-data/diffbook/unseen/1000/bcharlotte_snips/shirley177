in
the
court
for
the
chance
of
witnessing
her
return,
and
for
the
dearer
chance
of
receiving
her
in
my
arms
from
the
saddle.
I
have
noticed
(again
it
is
to
this
page
only
I
would
make
the
remark)
that
she
will
never
permit
any
man
but
myself
to
render
her
that
assistance.
I
have
seen
her
politely
decline
Sir
Philip
Nunnely's
aid.
She
is
always
mighty
gentle
with
her
young
baronet,
mighty
tender
for
his
feelings,
forsooth,
and
of
his
very
thin
skinned
amour
propre.
I
have
marked
her
haughtily
reject
Sam
Wynne's.
Now
I
know
my
heart
knows
it,
for
it
has
felt
it
that
she
resigns
herself
to
me
unreluctantly.
Is
she
conscious
how
my
strength
rejoices
to
serve
her?
I
myself
am
not
her
slave
I
declare
it
but
my
faculties
gather
to
her
beauty,
like
the
genii
to
the
glisten
of
the
lamp.
All
my
knowledge,
all
my
prudence,
all
my
calm,
and
all
my
power
stand
in
her
presence
humbly
waiting
a
task.
How
glad
they
are
when
a
mandate
comes!
What
joy
they
take
in
the
toils
she
assigns!
Does
she
know
it?
"I
have
called
her
careless.
It
is
remarkable
that
her
carelessness
never
compromises
her
refinement.
Indeed,
through
this
very
loophole
of
character,
the
reality,
depth,
genuineness
of
that
refinement
may
be
ascertained.
A
whole
garment
sometimes
covers
meagreness
and
malformation;
through
a
rent
sleeve
a
fair
round
arm
may
be
revealed.
I
have
seen
and
handled
many
of
her
possessions,
because
they
are
frequently
astray.
I
never
saw
anything
that
did
not
proclaim
the
lady
nothing
sordid,
nothing
soiled.
In
one
sense
she
is
as
scrupulous
as,
in
another,
she
is
unthinking.
As
a
peasant
girl,
she
would
go
ever
trim
and
cleanly.
Look
at
the
pure
kid
of
this
little
glove,
at
the
fresh,
unsullied
satin
of
the
bag.
"What
a
difference
there
is
between
S.
and
that
pearl
C.
H.!
Caroline,
I
fancy,
is
the
soul
of
conscientious
punctuality
and
nice
exactitude.
She
would
precisely
suit
the
domestic
habits
of
a
certain
fastidious
kinsman
of
mine
so
delicate,
dexterous,
quaint,
quick,
quiet
all
done
to
a
minute,
all
arranged
to
a
strawbreadth.
She
would
suit
Robert.
But
what
could
I
do
with
anything
so
nearly
faultless?
She
is
my
equal,
poor
as
myself.
She
is
certainly
pretty:
a
little
Raffaelle
head
hers
Raffaelle
in
feature,
quite
English
in
expression,
all
insular
grace
and
purity;
but
where
is
there
anything
to
alter,
anything
to
endure,
anything
to
reprimand,
to
be
anxious
about?
There
she
is,
a
lily
of
the
valley,
untinted,
needing
no
tint.
What
change
could
improve
her?
What
pencil
dare
to
paint?
My
sweetheart,
if
I
ever
have
one,
must
bear
nearer
affinity
to
the
rose
a
sweet,
lively
delight
guarded
with
prickly
peril.
My
wife,
if
I
ever
marry,
must
stir
my
great
frame
with
a
sting
now
and
then;
she
must
furnish
use
to
her
husband's
vast
mass
of
patience.
I
was
not
made
so
enduring
to
be
mated
with
a
lamb;
I
should
find
more
congenial
responsibility
in
the
charge
of
a
young
lioness
or
leopardess.
I
like
few
things
sweet
but
what
are
likewise
pungent
few
things
bright
but
what
are
likewise
hot.
I
like
the
summer
day,
whose
sun
makes
fruit
blush
and
corn
blanch.
Beauty
is
never
so
beautiful
as
when,
if
I
tease
it,
it
wreathes
back
on
me
with
spirit.
Fascination
is
never
so
imperial
as
when,
roused
and
half
ireful,
she
threatens
transformation
to
fierceness.
I
fear
I
should
tire
of
the
mute,
monotonous
innocence
of
the
lamb;
I
should
ere
long
feel
as
burdensome
the
nestling
dove
which
never
stirred
in
my
bosom;
but
my
patience
would
exult
in
stilling
the
flutterings
and
training
the
energies
of
the
restless
merlin.
In
managing
the
wild
instincts
of
the
scarce
manageable
bete
fauve
my
powers
would
revel.
"O
my
pupil!
O
Peri!
too
mutinous
for
heaven,
too
innocent
for
hell,
never
shall
I
do
more
than
see,
and
worship,
and
wish
for
thee.
Alas!
knowing
I
could
make
thee
happy,
will
it
be
my
doom
to
see
thee
possessed
by
those
who
have
not
that
power?
"However
kindly
the
hand,
if
it
is
feeble,
it
cannot
bend
Shirley;
and
she
must
be
bent.
It
cannot
curb
her;
and
she
must
be
curbed.
"Beware,
Sir
Philip
Nunnely!
I
never
see
you
walking
or
sitting
at
her
side,
and
observe
her
lips
compressed,
or
her
brow
knit,
in
resolute
endurance
of
some
trait
of
your
character
which
she
neither
admires
nor
likes,
in
determined
toleration
of
some
weakness
she
believes
atoned
for
by
a
virtue,
but
which
annoys
her
despite
that
belief;
I
never
mark
the
grave
glow
of
her
face,
the
unsmiling
sparkle
of
her
eye,
the
slight
recoil
of
her
whole
frame
when
you
draw
a
little
too
near,
and
gaze
a
little
too
expressively,
and
whisper
a
little
too
warmly
I
never
witness
these
things
but
I
think
of
the
fable
of
Semele
reversed.
"It
is
not
the
daughter
of
Cadmus
I
see,
nor
do
I
realize
her
fatal
longing
to
look
on
Jove
in
the
majesty
of
his
god
head.
It
is
a
priest
of
Juno
that
stands
before
me,
watching
late
and
lone
at
a
shrine
in
an
Argive
temple.
For
years
of
solitary
ministry
he
has
lived
on
dreams.
There
is
divine
madness
upon
him.
He
loves
the
idol
he
serves,
and
prays
day
and
night
that
his
frenzy
may
be
fed,
and
that
the
Ox
eyed
may
smile
on
her
votary.
She
has
heard;
she
will
be
propitious.
All
Argos
slumbers.
The
doors
of
the
temple
are
shut;
the
priest
waits
at
the
altar.
"A
shock
of
heaven
and
earth
is
felt
not
by
the
slumbering
city,
only
by
that
lonely
watcher,
brave
and
unshaken
in
his
fanaticism.
In
the
midst
of
silence,
with
no
preluding
sound,
he
is
wrapped
in
sudden
light.
Through
the
roof,
through
the
rent,
wide
yawning,
vast,
white
blazing
