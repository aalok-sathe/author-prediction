lofty
tone,
a
deep,
soft
sound,
like
a
storm
whispering,
made
twilight
undulate.
Once
more,
profounder,
nearer,
clearer,
it
rolled
harmonious.
Yet
again
a
distinct
voice
passed
between
Heaven
and
Earth.
"Eva!"
If
Eva
were
not
this
woman's
name,
she
had
none.
She
rose.
"Here
am
I."
"Eva!"
"O
Night
(it
can
be
but
Night
that
speaks),
I
am
here!"
The
voice,
descending,
reached
Earth.
"Eva!"
"Lord,"
she
cried,
"behold
thine
handmaid!"
She
had
her
religion
all
tribes
held
some
creed.
"I
come
a
Comforter!"
"Lord,
come
quickly!"
The
Evening
flushed
full
of
hope;
the
Air
panted;
the
Moon
rising
before
ascended
large,
but
her
light
showed
no
shape.
"Lean
towards
me,
Eva.
Enter
my
arms;
repose
thus."
"Thus
I
lean,
O
Invisible
but
felt!
And
what
art
thou?"
"Eva,
I
have
brought
a
living
draught
from
heaven.
Daughter
of
Man,
drink
of
my
cup!"
"I
drink:
it
is
as
if
sweetest
dew
visited
my
lips
in
a
full
current.
My
arid
heart
revives;
my
affliction
is
lightened;
my
strait
and
struggle
are
gone.
And
the
night
changes!
the
wood,
the
hill,
the
moon,
the
wide
sky
all
change!"
"All
change,
and
for
ever.
I
take
from
thy
vision
darkness;
I
loosen
from
thy
faculties
fetters!
I
level
in
thy
path
obstacles;
I
with
my
presence
fill
vacancy.
I
claim
as
mine
the
lost
atom
of
life.
I
take
to
myself
the
spark
of
soul
burning
heretofore
forgotten!"
"O
take
me!
O
claim
me!
This
is
a
god."
"This
is
a
son
of
God
one
who
feels
himself
in
the
portion
of
life
that
stirs
you.
He
is
suffered
to
reclaim
his
own,
and
so
to
foster
and
aid
that
it
shall
not
perish
hopeless."
"A
son
of
God!
Am
I
indeed
chosen?"
"Thou
only
in
this
land.
I
saw
thee
that
thou
wert
fair;
I
knew
thee
that
thou
wert
mine.
To
me
it
is
given
to
rescue,
to
sustain,
to
cherish
mine
own.
Acknowledge
in
me
that
Seraph
on
earth
named
Genius."
"My
glorious
Bridegroom!
true
Dayspring
from
on
high!
All
I
would
have
at
last
I
possess.
I
receive
a
revelation.
The
dark
hint,
the
obscure
whisper,
which
have
haunted
me
from
childhood,
are
interpreted.
Thou
art
He
I
sought.
Godborn,
take
me,
thy
bride!"
"Unhumbled,
I
can
take
what
is
mine.
Did
I
not
give
from
the
altar
the
very
flame
which
lit
Eva's
being?
Come
again
into
the
heaven
whence
thou
wert
sent."
That
Presence,
invisible
but
mighty,
gathered
her
in
like
a
lamb
to
the
fold;
that
voice,
soft
but
all
pervading,
vibrated
through
her
heart
like
music.
Her
eye
received
no
image;
and
yet
a
sense
visited
her
vision
and
her
brain
as
of
the
serenity
of
stainless
air,
the
power
of
sovereign
seas,
the
majesty
of
marching
stars,
the
energy
of
colliding
elements,
the
rooted
endurance
of
hills
wide
based,
and,
above
all,
as
of
the
lustre
of
heroic
beauty
rushing
victorious
on
the
Night,
vanquishing
its
shadows
like
a
diviner
sun.
Such
was
the
bridal
hour
of
Genius
and
Humanity.
Who
shall
rehearse
the
tale
of
their
after
union?
Who
shall
depict
its
bliss
and
bale?
Who
shall
tell
how
He
between
whom
and
the
Woman
God
put
enmity
forged
deadly
plots
to
break
the
bond
or
defile
its
purity?
Who
shall
record
the
long
strife
between
Serpent
and
Seraph:
How
still
the
Father
of
Lies
insinuated
evil
into
good,
pride
into
wisdom,
grossness
into
glory,
pain
into
bliss,
poison
into
passion?
How
the
"dreadless
Angel"
defied,
resisted,
and
repelled?
How
again
and
again
he
refined
the
polluted
cup,
exalted
the
debased
emotion,
rectified
the
perverted
impulse,
detected
the
lurking
venom,
baffled
the
frontless
temptation
purified,
justified,
watched,
and
withstood?
How,
by
his
patience,
by
his
strength,
by
that
unutterable
excellence
he
held
from
God
his
Origin
this
faithful
Seraph
fought
for
Humanity
a
good
fight
through
time;
and,
when
Time's
course
closed,
and
Death
was
encountered
at
the
end,
barring
with
fleshless
arm
the
portals
of
Eternity,
how
Genius
still
held
close
his
dying
bride,
sustained
her
through
the
agony
of
the
passage,
bore
her
triumphant
into
his
own
home,
Heaven;
restored
her,
redeemed,
to
Jehovah,
her
Maker;
and
at
last,
before
Angel
and
Archangel,
crowned
her
with
the
crown
of
Immortality?
Who
shall
of
these
things
write
the
chronicle?
"I
never
could
correct
that
composition,"
observed
Shirley,
as
Moore
concluded.
"Your
censor
pencil
scored
it
with
condemnatory
lines,
whose
signification
I
strove
vainly
to
fathom."
She
had
taken
a
crayon
from
the
tutor's
desk,
and
was
drawing
little
leaves,
fragments
of
pillars,
broken
crosses,
on
the
margin
of
the
book.
"French
may
be
half
forgotten,
but
the
habits
of
the
French
lesson
are
retained,
I
see,"
said
Louis.
"My
books
would
now,
as
erst,
be
unsafe
with
you.
My
newly
bound
St.
Pierre
would
soon
be
like
my
Racine
Miss
Keeldar,
her
mark,
traced
on
every
page."
Shirley
dropped
her
crayon
as
if
it
burned
her
fingers.
"Tell
me
what
were
the
faults
of
that
devoir?"
she
asked.
"Were
they
grammatical
errors,
or
did
you
object
to
the
substance?"
"I
never
said
that
the
lines
I
drew
were
indications
of
faults
at
all.
You
would
have
it
that
such
was
the
case,
and
I
refrained
from
contradiction."
"What
else
did
they
denote?"
"No
matter
now."
"Mr.
Moore,"
cried
Henry,
"make
Shirley
repeat
some
of
the
pieces
she
used
to
say
so
well
by
heart."
"If
I
ask
for
any,
it
will
be
'Le
Cheval
Dompte,'"
said
Moore,
trimming
with
his
penknife
the
pencil
Miss
Keeldar
had
worn
to
a
stump.
She
turned
aside
her
head;
the
neck,
the
clear
cheek,
forsaken
by
their
natural
veil,
were
seen
to
flush
warm.
"Ah!
she
has
not
forgotten,
you
see,
sir,"
said
Henry,
exultant.
"She
knows
how
naughty
she
was."
A
smile,
which
Shirley
would
not
permit
to
expand,
made
her
lip
tremble;
she
bent
her
face,
and
hid
it
half
with
her
arms,
half
in
her
curls,
which,
as
she
stooped,
