ten
days,
sneered
at
as
she
would
be
by
all
the
young
coquines
in
your
factory;"
then
softening,
"You
are
very
good,
dear
brother
excuse
my
petulance
but
truly
my
domestic
trials
are
severe,
yet
they
are
probably
my
destiny;
for
I
recollect
that
our
revered
mother
experienced
similar
sufferings,
though
she
had
the
choice
of
all
the
best
servants
in
Antwerp.
Domestics
are
in
all
countries
a
spoiled
and
unruly
set."
Mr.
Moore
had
also
certain
reminiscences
about
the
trials
of
his
revered
mother.
A
good
mother
she
had
been
to
him,
and
he
honoured
her
memory;
but
he
recollected
that
she
kept
a
hot
kitchen
of
it
in
Antwerp,
just
as
his
faithful
sister
did
here
in
England.
Thus,
therefore,
he
let
the
subject
drop,
and
when
the
coffee
service
was
removed,
proceeded
to
console
Hortense
by
fetching
her
music
book
and
guitar;
and
having
arranged
the
ribbon
of
the
instrument
round
her
neck
with
a
quiet
fraternal
kindness
he
knew
to
be
all
powerful
in
soothing
her
most
ruffled
moods,
he
asked
her
to
give
him
some
of
their
mother's
favourite
songs.
Nothing
refines
like
affection.
Family
jarring
vulgarizes;
family
union
elevates.
Hortense,
pleased
with
her
brother,
and
grateful
to
him,
looked,
as
she
touched
her
guitar,
almost
graceful,
almost
handsome;
her
everyday
fretful
look
was
gone
for
a
moment,
and
was
replaced
by
a
"sourire
plein
de
bonte."
She
sang
the
songs
he
asked
for,
with
feeling;
they
reminded
her
of
a
parent
to
whom
she
had
been
truly
attached;
they
reminded
her
of
her
young
days.
She
observed,
too,
that
Caroline
listened
with
naive
interest;
this
augmented
her
good
humour;
and
the
exclamation
at
the
close
of
the
song,
"I
wish
I
could
sing
and
play
like
Hortense!"
achieved
the
business,
and
rendered
her
charming
for
the
evening.
It
is
true
a
little
lecture
to
Caroline
followed,
on
the
vanity
of
wishing
and
the
duty
of
trying.
"As
Rome,"
it
was
suggested,
"had
not
been
built
in
a
day,
so
neither
had
Mademoiselle
Gerard
Moore's
education
been
completed
in
a
week,
or
by
merely
wishing
to
be
clever.
It
was
effort
that
had
accomplished
that
great
work.
She
was
ever
remarkable
for
her
perseverance,
for
her
industry.
Her
masters
had
remarked
that
it
was
as
delightful
as
it
was
uncommon
to
find
so
much
talent
united
with
so
much
solidity,
and
so
on."
Once
on
the
theme
of
her
own
merits,
mademoiselle
was
fluent.
Cradled
at
last
in
blissful
self
complacency,
she
took
her
knitting,
and
sat
down
tranquil.
Drawn
curtains,
a
clear
fire,
a
softly
shining
lamp,
gave
now
to
the
little
parlour
its
best,
its
evening
charm.
It
is
probable
that
the
three
there
present
felt
this
charm.
They
all
looked
happy.
"What
shall
we
do
now,
Caroline?"
asked
Mr.
Moore,
returning
to
his
seat
beside
his
cousin.
"What
shall
we
do,
Robert?"
repeated
she
playfully.
"You
decide."
"Not
play
at
chess?"
"No."
"Nor
draughts,
nor
backgammon?"
"No,
no;
we
both
hate
silent
games
that
only
keep
one's
hands
employed,
don't
we?"
"I
believe
we
do.
Then
shall
we
talk
scandal?"
"About
whom?
Are
we
sufficiently
interested
in
anybody
to
take
a
pleasure
in
pulling
their
character
to
pieces?"
"A
question
that
comes
to
the
point.
For
my
part,
unamiable
as
it
sounds,
I
must
say
no."
"And
I
too.
But
it
is
strange,
though
we
want
no
third
fourth,
I
mean
(she
hastily
and
with
contrition
glanced
at
Hortense),
living
person
among
us
so
selfish
we
are
in
our
happiness
though
we
don't
want
to
think
of
the
present
existing
world,
it
would
be
pleasant
to
go
back
to
the
past,
to
hear
people
that
have
slept
for
generations
in
graves
that
are
perhaps
no
longer
graves
now,
but
gardens
and
fields,
speak
to
us
and
tell
us
their
thoughts,
and
impart
their
ideas."
"Who
shall
be
the
speaker?
What
language
shall
he
utter?
French?"
"Your
French
forefathers
don't
speak
so
sweetly,
nor
so
solemnly,
nor
so
impressively
as
your
English
ancestors,
Robert.
To
night
you
shall
be
entirely
English.
You
shall
read
an
English
book."
"An
old
English
book?"
"Yes,
an
old
English
book
one
that
you
like;
and
I
will
choose
a
part
of
it
that
is
toned
quite
in
harmony
with
something
in
you.
It
shall
waken
your
nature,
fill
your
mind
with
music;
it
shall
pass
like
a
skilful
hand
over
your
heart,
and
make
its
strings
sound.
Your
heart
is
a
lyre,
Robert;
but
the
lot
of
your
life
has
not
been
a
minstrel
to
sweep
it,
and
it
is
often
silent.
Let
glorious
William
come
near
and
touch
it.
You
will
see
how
he
will
draw
the
English
power
and
melody
out
of
its
chords."
"I
must
read
Shakespeare?"
"You
must
have
his
spirit
before
you;
you
must
hear
his
voice
with
your
mind's
ear;
you
must
take
some
of
his
soul
into
yours."
"With
a
view
to
making
me
better?
Is
it
to
operate
like
a
sermon?"
"It
is
to
stir
you,
to
give
you
new
sensations.
It
is
to
make
you
feel
your
life
strongly
not
only
your
virtues,
but
your
vicious,
perverse
points."
"Dieu!
que
dit
elle?"
cried
Hortense,
who
hitherto
had
been
counting
stitches
in
her
knitting,
and
had
not
much
attended
to
what
was
said,
but
whose
ear
these
two
strong
words
caught
with
a
tweak.
"Never
mind
her,
sister;
let
her
talk.
Now
just
let
her
say
anything
she
pleases
to
night.
She
likes
to
come
down
hard
upon
your
brother
sometimes.
It
amuses
me,
so
let
her
alone."
Caroline,
who,
mounted
on
a
chair,
had
been
rummaging
the
bookcase,
returned
with
a
book.
"Here's
Shakespeare,"
she
said,
"and
there's
'Coriolanus.'
Now,
read,
and
discover
by
the
feelings
the
reading
will
give
you
at
once
how
low
and
how
high
you
are."
"Come,
then,
sit
near
me,
and
correct
when
I
mispronounce."
"I
am
to
be
the
teacher
then,
and
you
my
pupil?"
"Ainsi,
soit
il!"
"And
Shakespeare
is
