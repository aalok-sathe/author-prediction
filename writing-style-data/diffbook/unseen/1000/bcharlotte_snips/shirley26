reports
which
were
known
to
be
true
concerning
him
had
given
an
air
of
probability
to
those
which
were
falsely
circulated
respecting
his
better
principled
brother.
Caroline
had
never
known
her
mother,
as
she
was
taken
from
her
in
infancy,
and
had
not
since
seen
her;
her
father
died
comparatively
young,
and
her
uncle,
the
rector,
had
for
some
years
been
her
sole
guardian.
He
was
not,
as
we
are
aware,
much
adapted,
either
by
nature
or
habits,
to
have
the
charge
of
a
young
girl.
He
had
taken
little
trouble
about
her
education;
probably
he
would
have
taken
none
if
she,
finding
herself
neglected,
had
not
grown
anxious
on
her
own
account,
and
asked,
every
now
and
then,
for
a
little
attention,
and
for
the
means
of
acquiring
such
amount
of
knowledge
as
could
not
be
dispensed
with.
Still,
she
had
a
depressing
feeling
that
she
was
inferior,
that
her
attainments
were
fewer
than
were
usually
possessed
by
girls
of
her
age
and
station;
and
very
glad
was
she
to
avail
herself
of
the
kind
offer
made
by
her
cousin
Hortense,
soon
after
the
arrival
of
the
latter
at
Hollow's
Mill,
to
teach
her
French
and
fine
needle
work.
Mdlle.
Moore,
for
her
part,
delighted
in
the
task,
because
it
gave
her
importance;
she
liked
to
lord
it
a
little
over
a
docile
yet
quick
pupil.
She
took
Caroline
precisely
at
her
own
estimate,
as
an
irregularly
taught,
even
ignorant
girl;
and
when
she
found
that
she
made
rapid
and
eager
progress,
it
was
to
no
talent,
no
application,
in
the
scholar
she
ascribed
the
improvement,
but
entirely
to
her
own
superior
method
of
teaching.
When
she
found
that
Caroline,
unskilled
in
routine,
had
a
knowledge
of
her
own,
desultory
but
varied,
the
discovery
caused
her
no
surprise,
for
she
still
imagined
that
from
her
conversation
had
the
girl
unawares
gleaned
these
treasures.
She
thought
it
even
when
forced
to
feel
that
her
pupil
knew
much
on
subjects
whereof
she
knew
little.
The
idea
was
not
logical,
but
Hortense
had
perfect
faith
in
it.
Mademoiselle,
who
prided
herself
on
possessing
"un
esprit
positif,"
and
on
entertaining
a
decided
preference
for
dry
studies,
kept
her
young
cousin
to
the
same
as
closely
as
she
could.
She
worked
her
unrelentingly
at
the
grammar
of
the
French
language,
assigning
her,
as
the
most
improving
exercise
she
could
devise,
interminable
"analyses
logiques."
These
"analyses"
were
by
no
means
a
source
of
particular
pleasure
to
Caroline;
she
thought
she
could
have
learned
French
just
as
well
without
them,
and
grudged
excessively
the
time
spent
in
pondering
over
"propositions,
principales,
et
incidents;"
in
deciding
the
"incidente
determinative,"
and
the
"incidente
applicative;"
in
examining
whether
the
proposition
was
"pleine,"
"elliptique,"
or
"implicite."
Sometimes
she
lost
herself
in
the
maze,
and
when
so
lost
she
would,
now
and
then
(while
Hortense
was
rummaging
her
drawers
upstairs
an
unaccountable
occupation
in
which
she
spent
a
large
portion
of
each
day,
arranging,
disarranging,
rearranging,
and
counter
arranging),
carry
her
book
to
Robert
in
the
counting
house,
and
get
the
rough
place
made
smooth
by
his
aid.
Mr.
Moore
possessed
a
clear,
tranquil
brain
of
his
own.
Almost
as
soon
as
he
looked
at
Caroline's
little
difficulties
they
seemed
to
dissolve
beneath
his
eye.
In
two
minutes
he
would
explain
all,
in
two
words
give
the
key
to
the
puzzle.
She
thought
if
Hortense
could
only
teach
like
him,
how
much
faster
she
might
learn!
Repaying
him
by
an
admiring
and
grateful
smile,
rather
shed
at
his
feet
than
lifted
to
his
face,
she
would
leave
the
mill
reluctantly
to
go
back
to
the
cottage,
and
then,
while
she
completed
the
exercise,
or
worked
out
the
sum
(for
Mdlle.
Moore
taught
her
arithmetic
too),
she
would
wish
nature
had
made
her
a
boy
instead
of
a
girl,
that
she
might
ask
Robert
to
let
her
be
his
clerk,
and
sit
with
him
in
the
counting
house,
instead
of
sitting
with
Hortense
in
the
parlour.
Occasionally
but
this
happened
very
rarely
she
spent
the
evening
at
Hollow's
Cottage.
Sometimes
during
these
visits
Moore
was
away
attending
a
market;
sometimes
he
was
gone
to
Mr.
Yorke's;
often
he
was
engaged
with
a
male
visitor
in
another
room;
but
sometimes,
too,
he
was
at
home,
disengaged,
free
to
talk
with
Caroline.
When
this
was
the
case,
the
evening
hours
passed
on
wings
of
light;
they
were
gone
before
they
were
counted.
There
was
no
room
in
England
so
pleasant
as
that
small
parlour
when
the
three
cousins
occupied
it.
Hortense,
when
she
was
not
teaching,
or
scolding,
or
cooking,
was
far
from
ill
humoured;
it
was
her
custom
to
relax
towards
evening,
and
to
be
kind
to
her
young
English
kinswoman.
There
was
a
means,
too,
of
rendering
her
delightful,
by
inducing
her
to
take
her
guitar
and
sing
and
play.
She
then
became
quite
good
natured.
And
as
she
played
with
skill,
and
had
a
well
toned
voice,
it
was
not
disagreeable
to
listen
to
her.
It
would
have
been
absolutely
agreeable,
except
that
her
formal
and
self
important
character
modulated
her
strains,
as
it
impressed
her
manners
and
moulded
her
countenance.
Mr.
Moore,
released
from
the
business
yoke,
was,
if
not
lively
himself,
a
willing
spectator
of
Caroline's
liveliness,
a
complacent
listener
to
her
talk,
a
ready
respondent
to
her
questions.
He
was
something
agreeable
to
sit
near,
to
hover
round,
to
address
and
look
at.
Sometimes
he
was
better
than
this
almost
animated,
quite
gentle
and
friendly.
The
drawback
was
that
by
the
next
morning
he
was
sure
to
be
frozen
up
again;
and
however
much
he
seemed,
in
his
quiet
way,
to
enjoy
these
social
evenings,
he
rarely
contrived
their
recurrence.
This
circumstance
puzzled
the
inexperienced
head
of
his
cousin.
"If
I
had
a
means
of
happiness
at
my
command,"
she
thought,
"I
would
employ
that
means
often.
I
would
keep
it
bright
with
use,
and
not
let
it
lie
for
weeks
aside,
till
it
gets
rusty."
Yet
she
