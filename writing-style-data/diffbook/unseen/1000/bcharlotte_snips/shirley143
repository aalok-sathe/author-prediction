late
walk
home,
some
sweet,
poisoned
breeze,
redolent
of
honey
dew
and
miasma,
had
passed
into
her
lungs
and
veins,
and
finding
there
already
a
fever
of
mental
excitement,
and
a
languor
of
long
conflict
and
habitual
sadness,
had
fanned
the
spark
to
flame,
and
left
a
well
lit
fire
behind
it.
It
seemed,
however,
but
a
gentle
fire.
After
two
hot
days
and
worried
nights,
there
was
no
violence
in
the
symptoms,
and
neither
her
uncle,
nor
Fanny,
nor
the
doctor,
nor
Miss
Keeldar,
when
she
called,
had
any
fear
for
her.
A
few
days
would
restore
her,
every
one
believed.
The
few
days
passed,
and
though
it
was
still
thought
it
could
not
long
delay
the
revival
had
not
begun.
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
had
visited
her
daily
being
present
in
her
chamber
one
morning
when
she
had
been
ill
a
fortnight
watched
her
very
narrowly
for
some
minutes.
She
took
her
hand
and
placed
her
finger
on
her
wrist;
then,
quietly
leaving
the
chamber,
she
went
to
Mr.
Helstone's
study.
With
him
she
remained
closeted
a
long
time
half
the
morning.
On
returning
to
her
sick
young
friend,
she
laid
aside
shawl
and
bonnet.
She
stood
awhile
at
the
bedside,
one
hand
placed
in
the
other,
gently
rocking
herself
to
and
fro,
in
an
attitude
and
with
a
movement
habitual
to
her.
At
last
she
said,
"I
have
sent
Fanny
to
Fieldhead
to
fetch
a
few
things
for
me,
such
as
I
shall
want
during
a
short
stay
here.
It
is
my
wish
to
remain
with
you
till
you
are
better.
Your
uncle
kindly
permits
my
attendance.
Will
it
to
yourself
be
acceptable,
Caroline?"
"I
am
sorry
you
should
take
such
needless
trouble.
I
do
not
feel
very
ill,
but
I
cannot
refuse
resolutely.
It
will
be
such
comfort
to
know
you
are
in
the
house,
to
see
you
sometimes
in
the
room;
but
don't
confine
yourself
on
my
account,
dear
Mrs.
Pryor.
Fanny
nurses
me
very
well."
Mrs.
Pryor,
bending
over
the
pale
little
sufferer,
was
now
smoothing
the
hair
under
her
cap,
and
gently
raising
her
pillow.
As
she
performed
these
offices,
Caroline,
smiling,
lifted
her
face
to
kiss
her.
"Are
you
free
from
pain?
Are
you
tolerably
at
ease?"
was
inquired
in
a
low,
earnest
voice,
as
the
self
elected
nurse
yielded
to
the
caress.
"I
think
I
am
almost
happy."
"You
wish
to
drink?
Your
lips
are
parched."
She
held
a
glass
filled
with
some
cooling
beverage
to
her
mouth.
"Have
you
eaten
anything
to
day,
Caroline?"
"I
cannot
eat."
"But
soon
your
appetite
will
return;
it
must
return
that
is,
I
pray
God
it
may."
In
laying
her
again
on
the
couch,
she
encircled
her
in
her
arms;
and
while
so
doing,
by
a
movement
which
seemed
scarcely
voluntary,
she
drew
her
to
her
heart,
and
held
her
close
gathered
an
instant.
"I
shall
hardly
wish
to
get
well,
that
I
may
keep
you
always,"
said
Caroline.
Mrs.
Pryor
did
not
smile
at
this
speech.
Over
her
features
ran
a
tremor,
which
for
some
minutes
she
was
absorbed
in
repressing.
"You
are
more
used
to
Fanny
than
to
me,"
she
remarked
ere
long.
"I
should
think
my
attendance
must
seem
strange,
officious?"
"No;
quite
natural,
and
very
soothing.
You
must
have
been
accustomed
to
wait
on
sick
people,
ma'am.
You
move
about
the
room
so
softly,
and
you
speak
so
quietly,
and
touch
me
so
gently."
"I
am
dexterous
in
nothing,
my
dear.
You
will
often
find
me
awkward,
but
never
negligent."
Negligent,
indeed,
she
was
not.
From
that
hour
Fanny
and
Eliza
became
ciphers
in
the
sick
room.
Mrs.
Pryor
made
it
her
domain;
she
performed
all
its
duties;
she
lived
in
it
day
and
night.
The
patient
remonstrated
faintly,
however,
from
the
first,
and
not
at
all
ere
long.
Loneliness
and
gloom
were
now
banished
from
her
bedside;
protection
and
solace
sat
there
instead.
She
and
her
nurse
coalesced
in
wondrous
union.
Caroline
was
usually
pained
to
require
or
receive
much
attendance.
Mrs.
Pryor,
under
ordinary
circumstances,
had
neither
the
habit
nor
the
art
of
performing
little
offices
of
service;
but
all
now
passed
with
such
ease,
so
naturally,
that
the
patient
was
as
willing
to
be
cherished
as
the
nurse
was
bent
on
cherishing;
no
sign
of
weariness
in
the
latter
ever
reminded
the
former
that
she
ought
to
be
anxious.
There
was,
in
fact,
no
very
hard
duty
to
perform;
but
a
hireling
might
have
found
it
hard.
With
all
this
care
it
seemed
strange
the
sick
girl
did
not
get
well;
yet
such
was
the
case.
She
wasted
like
any
snow
wreath
in
thaw;
she
faded
like
any
flower
in
drought.
Miss
Keeldar,
on
whose
thoughts
danger
or
death
seldom
intruded,
had
at
first
entertained
no
fears
at
all
for
her
friend;
but
seeing
her
change
and
sink
from
time
to
time
when
she
paid
her
visits,
alarm
clutched
her
heart.
She
went
to
Mr.
Helstone
and
expressed
herself
with
so
much
energy
that
that
gentleman
was
at
last
obliged,
however
unwillingly,
to
admit
the
idea
that
his
niece
was
ill
of
something
more
than
a
migraine;
and
when
Mrs.
Pryor
came
and
quietly
demanded
a
physician,
he
said
she
might
send
for
two
if
she
liked.
One
came,
but
that
one
was
an
oracle.
He
delivered
a
dark
saying
of
which
the
future
was
to
solve
the
mystery,
wrote
some
prescriptions,
gave
some
directions
the
whole
with
an
air
of
crushing
authority
pocketed
his
fee,
and
went.
Probably
he
knew
well
enough
he
could
do
no
good,
but
didn't
like
to
say
so.
Still,
no
rumour
of
serious
illness
got
wind
in
the
neighbourhood.
At
Hollow's
Cottage
it
was
thought
that
Caroline
had
only
a
severe
cold,
she
having
written
a
note
to
Hortense
to
that
effect;
and
mademoiselle
contented
herself
with
sending
two
pots
of
currant
jam,
a
recipe
for
a
tisane,
and
a
note
of
advice.
Mrs.
Yorke
being
told
that
a
physician
had
been
