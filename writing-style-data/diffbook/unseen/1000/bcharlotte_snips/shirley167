heard
the
echo
of
his
own
deep
tones
in
the
girl's
voice,
that
modulated
itself
faithfully
on
his.
"Le
chene
et
le
Roseau,"
that
most
beautiful
of
La
Fontaine's
fables,
had
been
recited,
well
recited,
by
the
tutor,
and
the
pupil
had
animatedly
availed
herself
of
the
lesson.
Perhaps
a
simultaneous
feeling
seized
them
now,
that
their
enthusiasm
had
kindled
to
a
glow,
which
the
slight
fuel
of
French
poetry
no
longer
sufficed
to
feed;
perhaps
they
longed
for
a
trunk
of
English
oak
to
be
thrown
as
a
Yule
log
to
the
devouring
flame.
Moore
observed,
"And
these
are
our
best
pieces!
And
we
have
nothing
more
dramatic,
nervous,
natural!"
And
then
he
smiled
and
was
silent.
His
whole
nature
seemed
serenely
alight.
He
stood
on
the
hearth,
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece,
musing
not
unblissfully.
Twilight
was
closing
on
the
diminished
autumn
day.
The
schoolroom
windows
darkened
with
creeping
plants,
from
which
no
high
October
winds
had
as
yet
swept
the
sere
foliage
admitted
scarce
a
gleam
of
sky;
but
the
fire
gave
light
enough
to
talk
by.
And
now
Louis
Moore
addressed
his
pupil
in
French,
and
she
answered
at
first
with
laughing
hesitation
and
in
broken
phrase.
Moore
encouraged
while
he
corrected
her.
Henry
joined
in
the
lesson;
the
two
scholars
stood
opposite
the
master,
their
arms
round
each
other's
waists.
Tartar,
who
long
since
had
craved
and
obtained
admission,
sat
sagely
in
the
centre
of
the
rug,
staring
at
the
blaze
which
burst
fitful
from
morsels
of
coal
among
the
red
cinders.
The
group
were
happy
enough,
but
"Pleasures
are
like
poppies
spread;
You
seize
the
flower
its
bloom
is
shed."
The
dull,
rumbling
sound
of
wheels
was
heard
on
the
pavement
in
the
yard.
"It
is
the
carriage
returned,"
said
Shirley;
"and
dinner
must
be
just
ready,
and
I
am
not
dressed."
A
servant
came
in
with
Mr.
Moore's
candle
and
tea;
for
the
tutor
and
his
pupil
usually
dined
at
luncheon
time.
"Mr.
Sympson
and
the
ladies
are
returned,"
she
said,
"and
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
is
with
them."
"How
you
did
start,
and
how
your
hand
trembled,
Shirley!"
said
Henry,
when
the
maid
had
closed
the
shutter
and
was
gone.
"But
I
know
why
don't
you,
Mr.
Moore?
I
know
what
papa
intends.
He
is
a
little
ugly
man,
that
Sir
Philip.
I
wish
he
had
not
come.
I
wish
sisters
and
all
of
them
had
stayed
at
De
Walden
Hall
to
dine.
Shirley
should
once
more
have
made
tea
for
you
and
me,
Mr.
Moore,
and
we
would
have
had
a
happy
evening
of
it."
Moore
was
locking
up
his
desk
and
putting
away
his
St.
Pierre.
"That
was
your
plan,
was
it,
my
boy?"
"Don't
you
approve
it,
sir?"
"I
approve
nothing
utopian.
Look
Life
in
its
iron
face;
stare
Reality
out
of
its
brassy
countenance.
Make
the
tea,
Henry;
I
shall
be
back
in
a
minute."
He
left
the
room;
so
did
Shirley,
by
another
door.
Shirley
probably
got
on
pleasantly
with
Sir
Philip
that
evening,
for
the
next
morning
she
came
down
in
one
of
her
best
moods.
"Who
will
take
a
walk
with
me?"
she
asked,
after
breakfast.
"Isabella
and
Gertrude,
will
you?"
So
rare
was
such
an
invitation
from
Miss
Keeldar
to
her
female
cousins
that
they
hesitated
before
they
accepted
it.
Their
mamma,
however,
signifying
acquiescence
in
the
project,
they
fetched
their
bonnets,
and
the
trio
set
out.
It
did
not
suit
these
three
young
persons
to
be
thrown
much
together.
Miss
Keeldar
liked
the
society
of
few
ladies;
indeed,
she
had
a
cordial
pleasure
in
that
of
none
except
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Caroline
Helstone.
She
was
civil,
kind,
attentive
even
to
her
cousins;
but
still
she
usually
had
little
to
say
to
them.
In
the
sunny
mood
of
this
particular
morning,
she
contrived
to
entertain
even
the
Misses
Sympson.
Without
deviating
from
her
wonted
rule
of
discussing
with
them
only
ordinary
themes,
she
imparted
to
these
themes
an
extraordinary
interest;
the
sparkle
of
her
spirit
glanced
along
her
phrases.
What
made
her
so
joyous?
All
the
cause
must
have
been
in
herself.
The
day
was
not
bright.
It
was
dim
a
pale,
waning
autumn
day.
The
walks
through
the
dun
woods
were
damp;
the
atmosphere
was
heavy,
the
sky
overcast;
and
yet
it
seemed
that
in
Shirley's
heart
lived
all
the
light
and
azure
of
Italy,
as
all
its
fervour
laughed
in
her
gray
English
eye.
Some
directions
necessary
to
be
given
to
her
foreman,
John,
delayed
her
behind
her
cousins
as
they
neared
Fieldhead
on
their
return.
Perhaps
an
interval
of
twenty
minutes
elapsed
between
her
separation
from
them
and
her
re
entrance
into
the
house.
In
the
meantime
she
had
spoken
to
John,
and
then
she
had
lingered
in
the
lane
at
the
gate.
A
summons
to
luncheon
called
her
in.
She
excused
herself
from
the
meal,
and
went
upstairs.
"Is
not
Shirley
coming
to
luncheon?"
asked
Isabella.
"She
said
she
was
hungry."
An
hour
after,
as
she
did
not
quit
her
chamber,
one
of
her
cousins
went
to
seek
her
there.
She
was
found
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
bed,
her
head
resting
on
her
hand;
she
looked
quite
pale,
very
thoughtful,
almost
sad.
"You
are
not
ill?"
was
the
question
put.
"A
little
sick,"
replied
Miss
Keeldar.
Certainly
she
was
not
a
little
changed
from
what
she
had
been
two
hours
before.
This
change,
accounted
for
only
by
those
three
words,
explained
no
otherwise;
this
change
whencesoever
springing,
effected
in
a
brief
ten
minutes
passed
like
no
light
summer
cloud.
She
talked
when
she
joined
her
friends
at
dinner,
talked
as
usual.
She
remained
with
them
during
the
evening.
When
again
questioned
respecting
her
health,
she
declared
herself
perfectly
recovered.
It
had
been
a
mere
passing
faintness,
a
momentary
sensation,
not
worth
a
thought;
yet
it
was
felt
there
was
a
difference
in
Shirley.
The
next
day
the
day,
the
week,
the
fortnight
after
this
new
and
peculiar
shadow
