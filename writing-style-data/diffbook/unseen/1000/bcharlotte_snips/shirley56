my
son?"
asked
the
father.
"Somewhere
where
I
shall
be
safe
from
insult,
if
in
this
house
I
can
find
any
such
place."
Matthew
laughed
very
insolently.
Martin
threw
a
strange
look
at
him,
and
trembled
through
all
his
slight
lad's
frame;
but
he
restrained
himself.
"I
suppose
there
is
no
objection
to
my
withdrawing?"
he
inquired.
"No.
Go,
my
lad;
but
remember
not
to
bear
malice."
Martin
went,
and
Matthew
sent
another
insolent
laugh
after
him.
Rose,
lifting
her
fair
head
from
Moore's
shoulder,
against
which,
for
a
moment,
it
had
been
resting,
said,
as
she
directed
a
steady
gaze
to
Matthew,
"Martin
is
grieved,
and
you
are
glad;
but
I
would
rather
be
Martin
than
you.
I
dislike
your
nature."
Here
Mr.
Moore,
by
way
of
averting,
or
at
least
escaping,
a
scene
which
a
sob
from
Mrs.
Yorke
warned
him
was
likely
to
come
on
rose,
and
putting
Jessy
off
his
knee,
he
kissed
her
and
Rose,
reminding
them,
at
the
same
time,
to
be
sure
and
come
to
the
Hollow
in
good
time
to
morrow
afternoon;
then,
having
taken
leave
of
his
hostess,
he
said
to
Mr.
Yorke,
"May
I
speak
a
word
with
you?"
and
was
followed
by
him
from
the
room.
Their
brief
conference
took
place
in
the
hall.
"Have
you
employment
for
a
good
workman?"
asked
Moore.
"A
nonsense
question
in
these
times,
when
you
know
that
every
master
has
many
good
workmen
to
whom
he
cannot
give
full
employment."
"You
must
oblige
me
by
taking
on
this
man,
if
possible."
"My
lad,
I
can
take
on
no
more
hands
to
oblige
all
England."
"It
does
not
signify;
I
must
find
him
a
place
somewhere."
"Who
is
he?"
"William
Farren."
"I
know
William.
A
right
down
honest
man
is
William."
"He
has
been
out
of
work
three
months.
He
has
a
large
family.
We
are
sure
they
cannot
live
without
wages.
He
was
one
of
the
deputation
of
cloth
dressers
who
came
to
me
this
morning
to
complain
and
threaten.
William
did
not
threaten.
He
only
asked
me
to
give
them
rather
more
time
to
make
my
changes
more
slowly.
You
know
I
cannot
do
that:
straitened
on
all
sides
as
I
am,
I
have
nothing
for
it
but
to
push
on.
I
thought
it
would
be
idle
to
palaver
long
with
them.
I
sent
them
away,
after
arresting
a
rascal
amongst
them,
whom
I
hope
to
transport
a
fellow
who
preaches
at
the
chapel
yonder
sometimes."
"Not
Moses
Barraclough?"
"Yes."
"Ah!
you've
arrested
him?
Good!
Then
out
of
a
scoundrel
you're
going
to
make
a
martyr.
You've
done
a
wise
thing."
"I've
done
a
right
thing.
Well,
the
short
and
the
long
of
it
is,
I'm
determined
to
get
Farren
a
place,
and
I
reckon
on
you
to
give
him
one."
"This
is
cool,
however!"
exclaimed
Mr.
Yorke.
"What
right
have
you
to
reckon
on
me
to
provide
for
your
dismissed
workmen?
What
do
I
know
about
your
Farrens
and
your
Williams?
I've
heard
he's
an
honest
man,
but
am
I
to
support
all
the
honest
men
in
Yorkshire?
You
may
say
that
would
be
no
great
charge
to
undertake;
but
great
or
little,
I'll
none
of
it."
"Come,
Mr.
Yorke,
what
can
you
find
for
him
to
do?"
"I
find!
You'll
make
me
use
language
I'm
not
accustomed
to
use.
I
wish
you
would
go
home.
Here
is
the
door;
set
off."
Moore
sat
down
on
one
of
the
hall
chairs.
"You
can't
give
him
work
in
your
mill
good;
but
you
have
land.
Find
him
some
occupation
on
your
land,
Mr.
Yorke."
"Bob,
I
thought
you
cared
nothing
about
our
lourdauds
de
paysans.
I
don't
understand
this
change."
"I
do.
The
fellow
spoke
to
me
nothing
but
truth
and
sense.
I
answered
him
just
as
roughly
as
I
did
the
rest,
who
jabbered
mere
gibberish.
I
couldn't
make
distinctions
there
and
then.
His
appearance
told
what
he
had
gone
through
lately
clearer
than
his
words;
but
where
is
the
use
of
explaining?
Let
him
have
work."
"Let
him
have
it
yourself.
If
you
are
so
very
much
in
earnest,
strain
a
point."
"If
there
was
a
point
left
in
my
affairs
to
strain,
I
would
strain
it
till
it
cracked
again;
but
I
received
letters
this
morning
which
showed
me
pretty
clearly
where
I
stand,
and
it
is
not
far
off
the
end
of
the
plank.
My
foreign
market,
at
any
rate,
is
gorged.
If
there
is
no
change
if
there
dawns
no
prospect
of
peace
if
the
Orders
in
Council
are
not,
at
least,
suspended,
so
as
to
open
our
way
in
the
West
I
do
not
know
where
I
am
to
turn.
I
see
no
more
light
than
if
I
were
sealed
in
a
rock,
so
that
for
me
to
pretend
to
offer
a
man
a
livelihood
would
be
to
do
a
dishonest
thing."
"Come,
let
us
take
a
turn
on
the
front.
It
is
a
starlight
night,"
said
Mr.
Yorke.
They
passed
out,
closing
the
front
door
after
them,
and
side
by
side
paced
the
frost
white
pavement
to
and
fro.
"Settle
about
Farren
at
once,"
urged
Mr.
Moore.
"You
have
large
fruit
gardens
at
Yorke
Mills.
He
is
a
good
gardener.
Give
him
work
there."
"Well,
so
be
it.
I'll
send
for
him
to
morrow,
and
we'll
see.
And
now,
my
lad,
you're
concerned
about
the
condition
of
your
affairs?"
"Yes,
a
second
failure
which
I
may
delay,
but
which,
at
this
moment,
I
see
no
way
finally
to
avert
would
blight
the
name
of
Moore
completely;
and
you
are
aware
I
had
fine
intentions
of
paying
off
every
debt
and
re
establishing
the
old
firm
on
its
former
basis."
"You
want
capital
that's
all
you
want."
"Yes;
but
you
might
as
well
say
that
breath
is
all
a
dead
man
wants
to
live."
"I
know
I
know
capital
is
not
to
be
had
for
the
asking;
and
if
you
were
a
married
man,
and
had
