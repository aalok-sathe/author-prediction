already
have.
Celibacy
has
been
mine
for
thirty
years.
If
you
wish
to
offer
me
a
gift,
a
parting
present,
a
keepsake,
you
must
change
the
boon.'
"'Take
worse,
then!'
"'How
what?'
"I
now
felt,
and
looked,
and
spoke
eagerly.
I
was
unwise
to
quit
my
sheet
anchor
of
calm
even
for
an
instant;
it
deprived
me
of
an
advantage
and
transferred
it
to
her.
The
little
spark
of
temper
dissolved
in
sarcasm,
and
eddied
over
her
countenance
in
the
ripples
of
a
mocking
smile.
"'Take
a
wife
that
has
paid
you
court
to
save
your
modesty,
and
thrust
herself
upon
you
to
spare
your
scruples.'
"'Only
show
me
where.'
"'Any
stout
widow
that
has
had
a
few
husbands
already,
and
can
manage
these
things.'
"'She
must
not
be
rich,
then.
Oh
these
riches!'
"'Never
would
you
have
gathered
the
produce
of
the
gold
bearing
garden.
You
have
not
courage
to
confront
the
sleepless
dragon;
you
have
not
craft
to
borrow
the
aid
of
Atlas.'
"'You
look
hot
and
haughty.'
"'And
you
far
haughtier.
Yours
is
the
monstrous
pride
which
counterfeits
humility.'
"'I
am
a
dependant;
I
know
my
place.'
"'I
am
a
woman;
I
know
mine.'
"'I
am
poor;
I
must
be
proud.'
"'I
have
received
ordinances,
and
own
obligations
stringent
as
yours.'
"We
had
reached
a
critical
point
now,
and
we
halted
and
looked
at
each
other.
She
would
not
give
in,
I
felt.
Beyond
this
I
neither
felt
nor
saw.
A
few
moments
yet
were
mine.
The
end
was
coming
I
heard
its
rush
but
not
come.
I
would
dally,
wait,
talk,
and
when
impulse
urged
I
would
act.
I
am
never
in
a
hurry;
I
never
was
in
a
hurry
in
my
whole
life.
Hasty
people
drink
the
nectar
of
existence
scalding
hot;
I
taste
it
cool
as
dew.
I
proceeded:
'Apparently,
Miss
Keeldar,
you
are
as
little
likely
to
marry
as
myself.
I
know
you
have
refused
three
nay,
four
advantageous
offers,
and,
I
believe,
a
fifth.
Have
you
rejected
Sir
Philip
Nunnely?'
"I
put
this
question
suddenly
and
promptly.
"'Did
you
think
I
should
take
him?'
"'I
thought
you
might.'
"'On
what
grounds,
may
I
ask?'
"'Conformity
of
rank,
age,
pleasing
contrast
of
temper
for
he
is
mild
and
amiable
harmony
of
intellectual
tastes.'
"'A
beautiful
sentence!
Let
us
take
it
to
pieces.
"Conformity
of
rank."
He
is
quite
above
me.
Compare
my
grange
with
his
palace,
if
you
please.
I
am
disdained
by
his
kith
and
kin.
"Suitability
of
age."
We
were
born
in
the
same
year;
consequently
he
is
still
a
boy,
while
I
am
a
woman
ten
years
his
senior
to
all
intents
and
purposes.
"Contrast
of
temper."
Mild
and
amiable,
is
he;
I
what?
Tell
me.'
"'Sister
of
the
spotted,
bright,
quick,
fiery
leopard.'
"'And
you
would
mate
me
with
a
kid
the
millennium
being
yet
millions
of
centuries
from
mankind;
being
yet,
indeed,
an
archangel
high
in
the
seventh
heaven,
uncommissioned
to
descend?
Unjust
barbarian!
"Harmony
of
intellectual
tastes."
He
is
fond
of
poetry,
and
I
hate
it
'
"'Do
you?
That
is
news.'
"'I
absolutely
shudder
at
the
sight
of
metre
or
at
the
sound
of
rhyme
whenever
I
am
at
the
priory
or
Sir
Philip
at
Fieldhead.
Harmony,
indeed!
When
did
I
whip
up
syllabub
sonnets
or
string
stanzas
fragile
as
fragments
of
glass?
and
when
did
I
betray
a
belief
that
those
penny
beads
were
genuine
brilliants?'
"'You
might
have
the
satisfaction
of
leading
him
to
a
higher
standard,
of
improving
his
tastes.'
"'Leading
and
improving!
teaching
and
tutoring!
bearing
and
forbearing!
Pah!
my
husband
is
not
to
be
my
baby.
I
am
not
to
set
him
his
daily
lesson
and
see
that
he
learns
it,
and
give
him
a
sugar
plum
if
he
is
good,
and
a
patient,
pensive,
pathetic
lecture
if
he
is
bad.
But
it
is
like
a
tutor
to
talk
of
the
"satisfaction
of
teaching."
I
suppose
you
think
it
the
finest
employment
in
the
world.
I
don't.
I
reject
it.
Improving
a
husband!
No.
I
shall
insist
upon
my
husband
improving
me,
or
else
we
part.'
"'God
knows
it
is
needed!'
"'What
do
you
mean
by
that,
Mr.
Moore?'
"'What
I
say.
Improvement
is
imperatively
needed.'
"'If
you
were
a
woman
you
would
school
monsieur,
votre
mari,
charmingly.
It
would
just
suit
you;
schooling
is
your
vocation.'
"'May
I
ask
whether,
in
your
present
just
and
gentle
mood,
you
mean
to
taunt
me
with
being
a
tutor?'
"'Yes,
bitterly;
and
with
anything
else
you
please
any
defect
of
which
you
are
painfully
conscious.'
"'With
being
poor,
for
instance?'
"'Of
course;
that
will
sting
you.
You
are
sore
about
your
poverty;
you
brood
over
that.'
"'With
having
nothing
but
a
very
plain
person
to
offer
the
woman
who
may
master
my
heart?'
"'Exactly.
You
have
a
habit
of
calling
yourself
plain.
You
are
sensitive
about
the
cut
of
your
features
because
they
are
not
quite
on
an
Apollo
pattern.
You
abase
them
more
than
is
needful,
in
the
faint
hope
that
others
may
say
a
word
in
their
behalf
which
won't
happen.
Your
face
is
nothing
to
boast
of,
certainly
not
a
pretty
line
nor
a
pretty
tint
to
be
found
therein.'
"'Compare
it
with
your
own.'
"'It
looks
like
a
god
of
Egypt
a
great
sand
buried
stone
head;
or
rather
I
will
compare
it
to
nothing
so
lofty.
It
looks
like
Tartar.
You
are
my
mastiff's
cousin.
I
think
you
as
much
like
him
as
a
man
can
be
like
a
dog.'
"'Tartar
is
your
dear
companion.
In
summer,
when
you
rise
early,
and
run
out
into
the
fields
to
wet
your
feet
with
the
dew,
and
freshen
your
cheek
and
uncurl
your
hair
with
the
breeze,
you
always
call
him
to
follow
you.
You
call
him
sometimes
with
a
whistle
that
you
learned
from
me.
In
the
solitude
of
your
wood,
when
you
think
nobody
but
Tartar
is
listening,
you
whistle
the
very
tunes
you
imitated
from
my
lips,
