a
brute
and
such
a
puppy."
"Tut!"
said
the
imperturbable
Yorke,
"you
make
too
much
of
it;
but
still,
I
say,
I
am
capped.
Firstly,
that
she
did
not
love
you;
and
secondly,
that
you
did
not
love
her.
You
are
both
young;
you
are
both
handsome;
you
are
both
well
enough
for
wit
and
even
for
temper
take
you
on
the
right
side.
What
ailed
you
that
you
could
not
agree?"
"We
never
have
been,
never
could
be
at
home
with
each
other,
Yorke.
Admire
each
other
as
we
might
at
a
distance,
still
we
jarred
when
we
came
very
near.
I
have
sat
at
one
side
of
a
room
and
observed
her
at
the
other,
perhaps
in
an
excited,
genial
moment,
when
she
had
some
of
her
favourites
round
her
her
old
beaux,
for
instance,
yourself
and
Helstone,
with
whom
she
is
so
playful,
pleasant,
and
eloquent.
I
have
watched
her
when
she
was
most
natural,
most
lively,
and
most
lovely;
my
judgment
has
pronounced
her
beautiful.
Beautiful
she
is
at
times,
when
her
mood
and
her
array
partake
of
the
splendid.
I
have
drawn
a
little
nearer,
feeling
that
our
terms
of
acquaintance
gave
me
the
right
of
approach.
I
have
joined
the
circle
round
her
seat,
caught
her
eye,
and
mastered
her
attention;
then
we
have
conversed;
and
others,
thinking
me,
perhaps,
peculiarly
privileged,
have
withdrawn
by
degrees,
and
left
us
alone.
Were
we
happy
thus
left?
For
myself,
I
must
say
No.
Always
a
feeling
of
constraint
came
over
me;
always
I
was
disposed
to
be
stern
and
strange.
We
talked
politics
and
business.
No
soft
sense
of
domestic
intimacy
ever
opened
our
hearts,
or
thawed
our
language
and
made
it
flow
easy
and
limpid.
If
we
had
confidences,
they
were
confidences
of
the
counting
house,
not
of
the
heart.
Nothing
in
her
cherished
affection
in
me,
made
me
better,
gentler;
she
only
stirred
my
brain
and
whetted
my
acuteness.
She
never
crept
into
my
heart
or
influenced
its
pulse;
and
for
this
good
reason,
no
doubt,
because
I
had
not
the
secret
of
making
her
love
me."
"Well,
lad,
it
is
a
queer
thing.
I
might
laugh
at
thee,
and
reckon
to
despise
thy
refinements;
but
as
it
is
dark
night
and
we
are
by
ourselves,
I
don't
mind
telling
thee
that
thy
talk
brings
back
a
glimpse
of
my
own
past
life.
Twenty
five
years
ago
I
tried
to
persuade
a
beautiful
woman
to
love
me,
and
she
would
not.
I
had
not
the
key
to
her
nature;
she
was
a
stone
wall
to
me,
doorless
and
windowless."
"But
you
loved
her,
Yorke;
you
worshipped
Mary
Cave.
Your
conduct,
after
all,
was
that
of
a
man
never
of
a
fortune
hunter."
"Ay,
I
did
love
her;
but
then
she
was
beautiful
as
the
moon
we
do
not
see
to
night.
There
is
naught
like
her
in
these
days.
Miss
Helstone,
maybe,
has
a
look
of
her,
but
nobody
else."
"Who
has
a
look
of
her?"
"That
black
coated
tyrant's
niece
that
quiet,
delicate
Miss
Helstone.
Many
a
time
I
have
put
on
my
spectacles
to
look
at
the
lassie
in
church,
because
she
has
gentle
blue
een,
wi'
long
lashes;
and
when
she
sits
in
shadow,
and
is
very
still
and
very
pale,
and
is,
happen,
about
to
fall
asleep
wi'
the
length
of
the
sermon
and
the
heat
of
the
biggin',
she
is
as
like
one
of
Canova's
marbles
as
aught
else."
"Was
Mary
Cave
in
that
style?"
"Far
grander!
less
lass
like
and
flesh
like.
You
wondered
why
she
hadn't
wings
and
a
crown.
She
was
a
stately,
peaceful
angel
was
my
Mary."
"And
you
could
not
persuade
her
to
love
you?"
"Not
with
all
I
could
do,
though
I
prayed
Heaven
many
a
time,
on
my
bended
knees,
to
help
me."
"Mary
Cave
was
not
what
you
think
her,
Yorke.
I
have
seen
her
picture
at
the
rectory.
She
is
no
angel,
but
a
fair,
regular
featured,
taciturn
looking
woman
rather
too
white
and
lifeless
for
my
taste.
But,
supposing
she
had
been
something
better
than
she
was
"
"Robert,"
interrupted
Yorke,
"I
could
fell
you
off
your
horse
at
this
moment.
However,
I'll
hold
my
hand.
Reason
tells
me
you
are
right
and
I
am
wrong.
I
know
well
enough
that
the
passion
I
still
have
is
only
the
remnant
of
an
illusion.
If
Miss
Cave
had
possessed
either
feeling
or
sense,
she
could
not
have
been
so
perfectly
impassible
to
my
regard
as
she
showed
herself;
she
must
have
preferred
me
to
that
copper
faced
despot."
"Supposing,
Yorke,
she
had
been
educated
(no
women
were
educated
in
those
days);
supposing
she
had
possessed
a
thoughtful,
original
mind,
a
love
of
knowledge,
a
wish
for
information,
which
she
took
an
artless
delight
in
receiving
from
your
lips,
and
having
measured
out
to
her
by
your
hand;
supposing
her
conversation,
when
she
sat
at
your
side,
was
fertile,
varied,
imbued
with
a
picturesque
grace
and
genial
interest,
quiet
flowing
but
clear
and
bounteous;
supposing
that
when
you
stood
near
her
by
chance,
or
when
you
sat
near
her
by
design,
comfort
at
once
became
your
atmosphere,
and
content
your
element;
supposing
that
whenever
her
face
was
under
your
gaze,
or
her
idea
filled
your
thoughts,
you
gradually
ceased
to
be
hard
and
anxious,
and
pure
affection,
love
of
home,
thirst
for
sweet
discourse,
unselfish
longing
to
protect
and
cherish,
replaced
the
sordid,
cankering
calculations
of
your
trade;
supposing,
with
all
this,
that
many
a
time,
when
you
had
been
so
happy
as
to
possess
your
Mary's
little
hand,
you
had
felt
it
tremble
as
you
held
it,
just
as
a
warm
little
bird
trembles
when
you
take
it
from
its
nest;
supposing
you
had
noticed
her
shrink
into
the
background
on
your
entrance
into
a
room,
yet
if
you
sought
her
in
her
retreat
she
welcomed
you
with
the
sweetest
smile
that
ever
lit
a
fair
virgin
face,
and
only
