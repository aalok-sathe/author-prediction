a
family,
like
me,
I
should
think
your
case
pretty
nigh
desperate;
but
the
young
and
unencumbered
have
chances
peculiar
to
themselves.
I
hear
gossip
now
and
then
about
your
being
on
the
eve
of
marriage
with
this
miss
and
that;
but
I
suppose
it
is
none
of
it
true?"
"You
may
well
suppose
that.
I
think
I
am
not
in
a
position
to
be
dreaming
of
marriage.
Marriage!
I
cannot
bear
the
word;
it
sounds
so
silly
and
utopian.
I
have
settled
it
decidedly
that
marriage
and
love
are
superfluities,
intended
only
for
the
rich,
who
live
at
ease,
and
have
no
need
to
take
thought
for
the
morrow;
or
desperations
the
last
and
reckless
joy
of
the
deeply
wretched,
who
never
hope
to
rise
out
of
the
slough
of
their
utter
poverty."
"I
should
not
think
so
if
I
were
circumstanced
as
you
are.
I
should
think
I
could
very
likely
get
a
wife
with
a
few
thousands,
who
would
suit
both
me
and
my
affairs."
"I
wonder
where?"
"Would
you
try
if
you
had
a
chance?"
"I
don't
know.
It
depends
on
in
short,
it
depends
on
many
things."
"Would
you
take
an
old
woman?"
"I'd
rather
break
stones
on
the
road."
"So
would
I.
Would
you
take
an
ugly
one?"
"Bah!
I
hate
ugliness
and
delight
in
beauty.
My
eyes
and
heart,
Yorke,
take
pleasure
in
a
sweet,
young,
fair
face,
as
they
are
repelled
by
a
grim,
rugged,
meagre
one.
Soft
delicate
lines
and
hues
please,
harsh
ones
prejudice
me.
I
won't
have
an
ugly
wife."
"Not
if
she
were
rich?"
"Not
if
she
were
dressed
in
gems.
I
could
not
love
I
could
not
fancy
I
could
not
endure
her.
My
taste
must
have
satisfaction,
or
disgust
would
break
out
in
despotism,
or
worse
freeze
to
utter
iciness."
"What!
Bob,
if
you
married
an
honest,
good
natured,
and
wealthy
lass,
though
a
little
hard
favoured,
couldn't
you
put
up
with
the
high
cheek
bones,
the
rather
wide
mouth,
and
reddish
hair?"
"I'll
never
try,
I
tell
you.
Grace
at
least
I
will
have,
and
youth
and
symmetry
yes,
and
what
I
call
beauty."
"And
poverty,
and
a
nursery
full
of
bairns
you
can
neither
clothe
nor
feed,
and
very
soon
an
anxious,
faded
mother;
and
then
bankruptcy,
discredit
a
life
long
struggle."
"Let
me
alone,
Yorke."
"If
you
are
romantic,
Robert,
and
especially
if
you
are
already
in
love,
it
is
of
no
use
talking."
"I
am
not
romantic.
I
am
stripped
of
romance
as
bare
as
the
white
tenters
in
that
field
are
of
cloth."
"Always
use
such
figures
of
speech,
lad;
I
can
understand
them.
And
there
is
no
love
affair
to
disturb
your
judgment?"
"I
thought
I
had
said
enough
on
that
subject
before.
Love
for
me?
Stuff!"
"Well,
then,
if
you
are
sound
both
in
heart
and
head,
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
profit
by
a
good
chance
if
it
offers;
therefore,
wait
and
see."
"You
are
quite
oracular,
Yorke."
"I
think
I
am
a
bit
i'
that
line.
I
promise
ye
naught
and
I
advise
ye
naught;
but
I
bid
ye
keep
your
heart
up,
and
be
guided
by
circumstances."
"My
namesake
the
physician's
almanac
could
not
speak
more
guardedly."
"In
the
meantime,
I
care
naught
about
ye,
Robert
Moore:
ye
are
nothing
akin
to
me
or
mine,
and
whether
ye
lose
or
find
a
fortune
it
maks
no
difference
to
me.
Go
home,
now.
It
has
stricken
ten.
Miss
Hortense
will
be
wondering
where
ye
are."
Time
wore
on,
and
spring
matured.
The
surface
of
England
began
to
look
pleasant:
her
fields
grew
green,
her
hills
fresh,
her
gardens
blooming;
but
at
heart
she
was
no
better.
Still
her
poor
were
wretched,
still
their
employers
were
harassed.
Commerce,
in
some
of
its
branches,
seemed
threatened
with
paralysis,
for
the
war
continued;
England's
blood
was
shed
and
her
wealth
lavished
all,
it
seemed,
to
attain
most
inadequate
ends.
Some
tidings
there
were
indeed
occasionally
of
successes
in
the
Peninsula,
but
these
came
in
slowly;
long
intervals
occurred
between,
in
which
no
note
was
heard
but
the
insolent
self
felicitations
of
Bonaparte
on
his
continued
triumphs.
Those
who
suffered
from
the
results
of
the
war
felt
this
tedious,
and,
as
they
thought,
hopeless
struggle
against
what
their
fears
or
their
interests
taught
them
to
regard
as
an
invincible
power,
most
insufferable.
They
demanded
peace
on
any
terms.
Men
like
Yorke
and
Moore
and
there
were
thousands
whom
the
war
placed
where
it
placed
them,
shuddering
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
insisted
on
peace
with
the
energy
of
desperation.
They
held
meetings,
they
made
speeches,
they
got
up
petitions
to
extort
this
boon;
on
what
terms
it
was
made
they
cared
not.
All
men,
taken
singly,
are
more
or
less
selfish;
and
taken
in
bodies,
they
are
intensely
so.
The
British
merchant
is
no
exception
to
this
rule:
the
mercantile
classes
illustrate
it
strikingly.
These
classes
certainly
think
too
exclusively
of
making
money;
they
are
too
oblivious
of
every
national
consideration
but
that
of
extending
England's
that
is,
their
own
commerce.
Chivalrous
feeling,
disinterestedness,
pride
in
honour,
is
too
dead
in
their
hearts.
A
land
ruled
by
them
alone
would
too
often
make
ignominious
submission
not
at
all
from
the
motives
Christ
teaches,
but
rather
from
those
Mammon
instils.
During
the
late
war,
the
tradesmen
of
England
would
have
endured
buffets
from
the
French
on
the
right
cheek
and
on
the
left;
their
cloak
they
would
have
given
to
Napoleon,
and
then
have
politely
offered
him
their
coat
also,
nor
would
they
have
withheld
their
waistcoat
if
urged;
they
would
have
prayed
permission
only
to
retain
their
one
other
garment,
for
the
sake
of
the
purse
in
its
pocket.
Not
one
spark
of
spirit,
not
one
symptom
of
resistance,
would
they
have
shown
till
the
hand
of
the
Corsican
bandit
had
grasped
that
beloved
purse;
then,
perhaps,
transfigured
at
once
into
British
bulldogs,
they
would
have
sprung
at
