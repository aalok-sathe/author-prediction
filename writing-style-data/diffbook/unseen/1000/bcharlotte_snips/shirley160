often
takes
the
form
of
repeating
again
and
again
a
similar
stroke
of
luck
in
the
same
quarter.
It
appeared
that
Miss
Keeldar
or
her
fortune
had
by
this
time
made
a
sensation
in
the
district,
and
produced
an
impression
in
quarters
by
her
unthought
of.
No
less
than
three
offers
followed
Mr.
Wynne's,
all
more
or
less
eligible.
All
were
in
succession
pressed
on
her
by
her
uncle,
and
all
in
succession
she
refused.
Yet
amongst
them
was
more
than
one
gentleman
of
unexceptionable
character
as
well
as
ample
wealth.
Many
besides
her
uncle
asked
what
she
meant,
and
whom
she
expected
to
entrap,
that
she
was
so
insolently
fastidious.
At
last
the
gossips
thought
they
had
found
the
key
to
her
conduct,
and
her
uncle
was
sure
of
it;
and
what
is
more,
the
discovery
showed
his
niece
to
him
in
quite
a
new
light,
and
he
changed
his
whole
deportment
to
her
accordingly.
Fieldhead
had
of
late
been
fast
growing
too
hot
to
hold
them
both.
The
suave
aunt
could
not
reconcile
them;
the
daughters
froze
at
the
view
of
their
quarrels.
Gertrude
and
Isabella
whispered
by
the
hour
together
in
their
dressing
room,
and
became
chilled
with
decorous
dread
if
they
chanced
to
be
left
alone
with
their
audacious
cousin.
But,
as
I
have
said,
a
change
supervened.
Mr.
Sympson
was
appeased
and
his
family
tranquillized.
The
village
of
Nunnely
has
been
alluded
to
its
old
church,
its
forest,
its
monastic
ruins.
It
had
also
its
hall,
called
the
priory
an
older,
a
larger,
a
more
lordly
abode
than
any
Briarfield
or
Whinbury
owned;
and
what
is
more,
it
had
its
man
of
title
its
baronet,
which
neither
Briarfield
nor
Whinbury
could
boast.
This
possession
its
proudest
and
most
prized
had
for
years
been
nominal
only.
The
present
baronet,
a
young
man
hitherto
resident
in
a
distant
province,
was
unknown
on
his
Yorkshire
estate.
During
Miss
Keeldar's
stay
at
the
fashionable
watering
place
of
Cliffbridge,
she
and
her
friends
had
met
with
and
been
introduced
to
Sir
Philip
Nunnely.
They
encountered
him
again
and
again
on
the
sands,
the
cliffs,
in
the
various
walks,
sometimes
at
the
public
balls
of
the
place.
He
seemed
solitary.
His
manner
was
very
unpretending
too
simple
to
be
termed
affable;
rather
timid
than
proud.
He
did
not
condescend
to
their
society;
he
seemed
glad
of
it.
With
any
unaffected
individual
Shirley
could
easily
and
quickly
cement
an
acquaintance.
She
walked
and
talked
with
Sir
Philip;
she,
her
aunt,
and
cousins
sometimes
took
a
sail
in
his
yacht.
She
liked
him
because
she
found
him
kind
and
modest,
and
was
charmed
to
feel
she
had
the
power
to
amuse
him.
One
slight
drawback
there
was
where
is
the
friendship
without
it?
Sir
Philip
had
a
literary
turn.
He
wrote
poetry
sonnets,
stanzas,
ballads.
Perhaps
Miss
Keeldar
thought
him
a
little
too
fond
of
reading
and
reciting
these
compositions;
perhaps
she
wished
the
rhyme
had
possessed
more
accuracy,
the
measure
more
music,
the
tropes
more
freshness,
the
inspiration
more
fire.
At
any
rate,
she
always
winced
when
he
recurred
to
the
subject
of
his
poems,
and
usually
did
her
best
to
divert
the
conversation
into
another
channel.
He
would
beguile
her
to
take
moonlight
walks
with
him
on
the
bridge,
for
the
sole
purpose,
as
it
seemed,
of
pouring
into
her
ear
the
longest
of
his
ballads.
He
would
lead
her
away
to
sequestered
rustic
seats,
whence
the
rush
of
the
surf
to
the
sands
was
heard
soft
and
soothing;
and
when
he
had
her
all
to
himself,
and
the
sea
lay
before
them,
and
the
scented
shade
of
gardens
spread
round,
and
the
tall
shelter
of
cliffs
rose
behind
them,
he
would
pull
out
his
last
batch
of
sonnets,
and
read
them
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
emotion.
He
did
not
seem
to
know
that
though
they
might
be
rhyme
they
were
not
poetry.
It
appeared,
by
Shirley's
downcast
eye
and
disturbed
face,
that
she
knew
it,
and
felt
heartily
mortified
by
the
single
foible
of
this
good
and
amiable
gentleman.
Often
she
tried,
as
gently
as
might
be,
to
wean
him
from
this
fanatic
worship
of
the
Muses.
It
was
his
monomania;
on
all
ordinary
subjects
he
was
sensible
enough,
and
fain
was
she
to
engage
him
in
ordinary
topics.
He
questioned
her
sometimes
about
his
place
at
Nunnely;
she
was
but
too
happy
to
answer
his
interrogatories
at
length.
She
never
wearied
of
describing
the
antique
priory,
the
wild
silvan
park,
the
hoary
church
and
hamlet;
nor
did
she
fail
to
counsel
him
to
come
down
and
gather
his
tenantry
about
him
in
his
ancestral
halls.
Somewhat
to
her
surprise,
Sir
Philip
followed
her
advice
to
the
letter,
and
actually,
towards
the
close
of
September,
arrived
at
the
priory.
He
soon
made
a
call
at
Fieldhead,
and
his
first
visit
was
not
his
last.
He
said
when
he
had
achieved
the
round
of
the
neighbourhood
that
under
no
roof
had
he
found
such
pleasant
shelter
as
beneath
the
massive
oak
beams
of
the
gray
manor
house
of
Briarfield;
a
cramped,
modest
dwelling
enough
compared
with
his
own,
but
he
liked
it.
Presently
it
did
not
suffice
to
sit
with
Shirley
in
her
panelled
parlour,
where
others
came
and
went,
and
where
he
could
rarely
find
a
quiet
moment
to
show
her
the
latest
production
of
his
fertile
muse;
he
must
have
her
out
amongst
the
pleasant
pastures,
and
lead
her
by
the
still
waters.
Tete
a
tete
ramblings
she
shunned,
so
he
made
parties
for
her
to
his
own
grounds,
his
glorious
forest;
to
remoter
scenes
woods
severed
by
the
Wharfe,
vales
watered
by
the
Aire.
Such
assiduity
covered
Miss
Keeldar
with
distinction.
Her
uncle's
prophetic
soul
anticipated
a
splendid
future.
He
already
scented
the
time
afar
off
when,
with
nonchalant
air,
and
left
foot
nursed
on
his
right
knee,
he
should
be
able
to
make
dashingly
familiar
allusion
to
his
"nephew
the
baronet."
Now
his
niece
dawned
upon
