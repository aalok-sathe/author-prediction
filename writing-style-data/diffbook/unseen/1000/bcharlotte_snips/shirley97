but
where
four
such
natures
as
Mr.
Hall,
David
Sweeting,
Shirley,
and
Caroline
were
assembled
in
health
and
amity,
on
a
green
lawn,
under
a
sunny
sky,
amidst
a
wilderness
of
flowers,
there
could
not
be
ungenial
dullness.
In
the
course
of
conversation
Mr.
Hall
reminded
the
ladies
that
Whitsuntide
was
approaching,
when
the
grand
united
Sunday
school
tea
drinking
and
procession
of
the
three
parishes
of
Briarfield,
Whinbury,
and
Nunnely
were
to
take
place.
Caroline,
he
knew,
would
be
at
her
post
as
teacher,
he
said,
and
he
hoped
Miss
Keeldar
would
not
be
wanting.
He
hoped
she
would
make
her
first
public
appearance
amongst
them
at
that
time.
Shirley
was
not
the
person
to
miss
an
occasion
of
this
sort.
She
liked
festive
excitement,
a
gathering
of
happiness,
a
concentration
and
combination
of
pleasant
details,
a
throng
of
glad
faces,
a
muster
of
elated
hearts.
She
told
Mr.
Hall
they
might
count
on
her
with
security.
She
did
not
know
what
she
would
have
to
do,
but
they
might
dispose
of
her
as
they
pleased.
"And,"
said
Caroline,
"you
will
promise
to
come
to
my
table,
and
to
sit
near
me,
Mr.
Hall?"
"I
shall
not
fail,
Deo
volente,"
said
he.
"I
have
occupied
the
place
on
her
right
hand
at
these
monster
tea
drinkings
for
the
last
six
years,"
he
proceeded,
turning
to
Miss
Keeldar.
"They
made
her
a
Sunday
school
teacher
when
she
was
a
little
girl
of
twelve.
She
is
not
particularly
self
confident
by
nature,
as
you
may
have
observed;
and
the
first
time
she
had
to
'take
a
tray,'
as
the
phrase
is,
and
make
tea
in
public,
there
was
some
piteous
trembling
and
flushing.
I
observed
the
speechless
panic,
the
cups
shaking
in
the
little
hand,
and
the
overflowing
teapot
filled
too
full
from
the
urn.
I
came
to
her
aid,
took
a
seat
near
her,
managed
the
urn
and
the
slop
basin,
and
in
fact
made
the
tea
for
her
like
any
old
woman."
"I
was
very
grateful
to
you,"
interposed
Caroline.
"You
were.
You
told
me
so
with
an
earnest
sincerity
that
repaid
me
well,
inasmuch
as
it
was
not
like
the
majority
of
little
ladies
of
twelve,
whom
you
may
help
and
caress
for
ever
without
their
evincing
any
quicker
sense
of
the
kindness
done
and
meant
than
if
they
were
made
of
wax
and
wood
instead
of
flesh
and
nerves.
She
kept
close
to
me,
Miss
Keeldar,
the
rest
of
the
evening,
walking
with
me
over
the
grounds
where
the
children
were
playing;
she
followed
me
into
the
vestry
when
all
were
summoned
into
church;
she
would,
I
believe,
have
mounted
with
me
to
the
pulpit,
had
I
not
taken
the
previous
precaution
of
conducting
her
to
the
rectory
pew."
"And
he
has
been
my
friend
ever
since,"
said
Caroline.
"And
always
sat
at
her
table,
near
her
tray,
and
handed
the
cups
that
is
the
extent
of
my
services.
The
next
thing
I
do
for
her
will
be
to
marry
her
some
day
to
some
curate
or
mill
owner.
But
mind,
Caroline,
I
shall
inquire
about
the
bridegroom's
character;
and
if
he
is
not
a
gentleman
likely
to
render
happy
the
little
girl
who
walked
with
me
hand
in
hand
over
Nunnely
Common,
I
will
not
officiate.
So
take
care."
"The
caution
is
useless.
I
am
not
going
to
be
married.
I
shall
live
single,
like
your
sister
Margaret,
Mr.
Hall."
"Very
well.
You
might
do
worse.
Margaret
is
not
unhappy.
She
has
her
books
for
a
pleasure,
and
her
brother
for
a
care,
and
is
content.
If
ever
you
want
a
home,
if
the
day
should
come
when
Briarfield
rectory
is
yours
no
longer,
come
to
Nunnely
vicarage.
Should
the
old
maid
and
bachelor
be
still
living,
they
will
make
you
tenderly
welcome."
"There
are
your
flowers.
Now,"
said
Caroline,
who
had
kept
the
nosegay
she
had
selected
for
him
till
this
moment,
"you
don't
care
for
a
bouquet,
but
you
must
give
it
to
Margaret;
only
to
be
sentimental
for
once
keep
that
little
forget
me
not,
which
is
a
wild
flower
I
gathered
from
the
grass;
and
to
be
still
more
sentimental
let
me
take
two
or
three
of
the
blue
blossoms
and
put
them
in
my
souvenir."
And
she
took
out
a
small
book
with
enamelled
cover
and
silver
clasp,
wherein,
having
opened
it,
she
inserted
the
flowers,
writing
round
them
in
pencil,
"To
be
kept
for
the
sake
of
the
Rev.
Cyril
Hall,
my
friend.
May
18
."
The
Rev.
Cyril
Hall,
on
his
part,
also
placed
a
sprig
in
safety
between
the
leaves
of
a
pocket
Testament.
He
only
wrote
on
the
margin,
"Caroline."
"Now,"
said
he,
smiling,
"I
trust
we
are
romantic
enough.
Miss
Keeldar,"
he
continued
(the
curates,
by
the
bye,
during
this
conversation,
were
too
much
occupied
with
their
own
jokes
to
notice
what
passed
at
the
other
end
of
the
table),
"I
hope
you
are
laughing
at
this
trait
of
'exaltation'
in
the
old
gray
headed
vicar;
but
the
fact
is,
I
am
so
used
to
comply
with
the
requests
of
this
young
friend
of
yours,
I
don't
know
how
to
refuse
her
when
she
tells
me
to
do
anything.
You
would
say
it
is
not
much
in
my
way
to
traffic
with
flowers
and
forget
me
nots;
but,
you
see,
when
requested
to
be
sentimental,
I
am
obedient."
"He
is
naturally
rather
sentimental,"
remarked
Caroline.
"Margaret
told
me
so,
and
I
know
what
pleases
him."
"That
you
should
be
good
and
happy?
Yes;
that
is
one
of
my
greatest
pleasures.
May
God
long
preserve
to
you
the
blessings
of
peace
and
innocence!
By
which
phrase
I
mean
comparative
innocence;
for
in
His
sight,
I
am
well
aware,
none
are
pure.
What
to
our
human
perceptions
looks
spotless
as
we
fancy
angels,
is
to
Him
but
frailty,
needing
the
blood
of
His
Son
to
cleanse,
and
the
strength
of
His
Spirit
to
sustain.
Let
us
each
and
