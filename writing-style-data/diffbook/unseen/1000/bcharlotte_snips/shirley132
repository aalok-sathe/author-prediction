for
a
neglectful
swain?
Does
she
sit
the
day
long
bent
over
some
sedentary
task?
Has
she
for
ever
a
book
in
her
hand,
or
sewing
on
her
knee,
and
eyes
only
for
that,
and
words
for
nothing,
and
thoughts
unspoken?
By
no
means.
Shirley
is
all
right.
If
her
wistful
cast
of
physiognomy
is
not
gone,
no
more
is
her
careless
smile.
She
keeps
her
dark
old
manor
house
light
and
bright
with
her
cheery
presence.
The
gallery
and
the
low
ceiled
chambers
that
open
into
it
have
learned
lively
echoes
from
her
voice;
the
dim
entrance
hall,
with
its
one
window,
has
grown
pleasantly
accustomed
to
the
frequent
rustle
of
a
silk
dress,
as
its
wearer
sweeps
across
from
room
to
room,
now
carrying
flowers
to
the
barbarous
peach
bloom
salon,
now
entering
the
dining
room
to
open
its
casements
and
let
in
the
scent
of
mignonette
and
sweet
briar,
anon
bringing
plants
from
the
staircase
window
to
place
in
the
sun
at
the
open
porch
door.
She
takes
her
sewing
occasionally;
but,
by
some
fatality,
she
is
doomed
never
to
sit
steadily
at
it
for
above
five
minutes
at
a
time.
Her
thimble
is
scarcely
fitted
on,
her
needle
scarce
threaded,
when
a
sudden
thought
calls
her
upstairs.
Perhaps
she
goes
to
seek
some
just
then
remembered
old
ivory
backed
needle
book
or
older
china
topped
work
box,
quite
unneeded,
but
which
seems
at
the
moment
indispensable;
perhaps
to
arrange
her
hair,
or
a
drawer
which
she
recollects
to
have
seen
that
morning
in
a
state
of
curious
confusion;
perhaps
only
to
take
a
peep
from
a
particular
window
at
a
particular
view,
whence
Briarfield
church
and
rectory
are
visible,
pleasantly
bowered
in
trees.
She
has
scarcely
returned,
and
again
taken
up
the
slip
of
cambric
or
square
of
half
wrought
canvas,
when
Tartar's
bold
scrape
and
strangled
whistle
are
heard
at
the
porch
door,
and
she
must
run
to
open
it
for
him.
It
is
a
hot
day;
he
comes
in
panting;
she
must
convoy
him
to
the
kitchen,
and
see
with
her
own
eyes
that
his
water
bowl
is
replenished.
Through
the
open
kitchen
door
the
court
is
visible,
all
sunny
and
gay,
and
people
with
turkeys
and
their
poults,
peahens
and
their
chicks,
pearl
flecked
Guinea
fowls,
and
a
bright
variety
of
pure
white,
and
purple
necked,
and
blue
and
cinnamon
plumed
pigeons.
Irresistible
spectacle
to
Shirley!
She
runs
to
the
pantry
for
a
roll,
and
she
stands
on
the
door
step
scattering
crumbs.
Around
her
throng
her
eager,
plump,
happy
feathered
vassals
John
is
about
the
stables,
and
John
must
be
talked
to,
and
her
mare
looked
at.
She
is
still
petting
and
patting
it
when
the
cows
come
in
to
be
milked.
This
is
important;
Shirley
must
stay
and
take
a
review
of
them
all.
There
are
perhaps
some
little
calves,
some
little
new
yeaned
lambs
it
may
be
twins,
whose
mothers
have
rejected
them.
Miss
Keeldar
must
be
introduced
to
them
by
John,
must
permit
herself
the
treat
of
feeding
them
with
her
own
hand,
under
the
direction
of
her
careful
foreman.
Meantime
John
moots
doubtful
questions
about
the
farming
of
certain
"crofts,"
and
"ings,"
and
"holmes,"
and
his
mistress
is
necessitated
to
fetch
her
garden
hat
a
gipsy
straw
and
accompany
him,
over
stile
and
along
hedgerow,
to
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
agricultural
matter
on
the
spot,
and
with
the
said
"crofts,"
"ings,"
and
"holms"
under
her
eye.
Bright
afternoon
thus
wears
into
soft
evening,
and
she
comes
home
to
a
late
tea,
and
after
tea
she
never
sews.
After
tea
Shirley
reads,
and
she
is
just
about
as
tenacious
of
her
book
as
she
is
lax
of
her
needle.
Her
study
is
the
rug,
her
seat
a
footstool,
or
perhaps
only
the
carpet
at
Mrs.
Pryor's
feet:
there
she
always
learned
her
lessons
when
a
child,
and
old
habits
have
a
strong
power
over
her.
The
tawny
and
lionlike
bulk
of
Tartar
is
ever
stretched
beside
her,
his
negro
muzzle
laid
on
his
fore
paws
straight,
strong,
and
shapely
as
the
limbs
of
an
Alpine
wolf.
One
hand
of
the
mistress
generally
reposes
on
the
loving
serf's
rude
head,
because
if
she
takes
it
away
he
groans
and
is
discontented.
Shirley's
mind
is
given
to
her
book.
She
lifts
not
her
eyes;
she
neither
stirs
nor
speaks
unless,
indeed,
it
be
to
return
a
brief
respectful
answer
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
addresses
deprecatory
phrases
to
her
now
and
then.
"My
dear,
you
had
better
not
have
that
great
dog
so
near
you;
he
is
crushing
the
border
of
your
dress."
"Oh,
it
is
only
muslin.
I
can
put
a
clean
one
on
to
morrow."
"My
dear,
I
wish
you
could
acquire
the
habit
of
sitting
to
a
table
when
you
read."
"I
will
try,
ma'am,
some
time;
but
it
is
so
comfortable
to
do
as
one
has
always
been
accustomed
to
do."
"My
dear,
let
me
beg
of
you
to
put
that
book
down.
You
are
trying
your
eyes
by
the
doubtful
firelight."
"No,
ma'am,
not
at
all;
my
eyes
are
never
tired."
At
last,
however,
a
pale
light
falls
on
the
page
from
the
window.
She
looks;
the
moon
is
up.
She
closes
the
volume,
rises,
and
walks
through
the
room.
Her
book
has
perhaps
been
a
good
one;
it
has
refreshed,
refilled,
rewarmed
her
heart;
it
has
set
her
brain
astir,
furnished
her
mind
with
pictures.
The
still
parlour,
the
clean
hearth,
the
window
opening
on
the
twilight
sky,
and
showing
its
"sweet
regent,"
new
throned
and
glorious,
suffice
to
make
earth
an
Eden,
life
a
poem,
for
Shirley.
A
still,
deep,
inborn
delight
glows
in
her
young
veins,
unmingled,
untroubled,
not
to
be
reached
or
ravished
by
human
agency,
because
by
no
human
agency
bestowed
the
pure
gift
of
God
to
His
creature,
the
free
dower
of
Nature
to
her
child.
This
joy
gives
her
experience
of
a
genii
life.
Buoyant,
by
green
steps,
