painful
step?"
"My
dear,"
said
Mrs.
Pryor,
"you
are
very
young
to
be
a
governess,
and
not
sufficiently
robust.
The
duties
a
governess
undertakes
are
often
severe."
"And
I
believe
I
want
severe
duties
to
occupy
me."
"Occupy
you!"
cried
Shirley.
"When
are
you
idle?
I
never
saw
a
more
industrious
girl
than
you.
You
are
always
at
work.
Come,"
she
continued
"come
and
sit
by
my
side,
and
take
some
tea
to
refresh
you.
You
don't
care
much
for
my
friendship,
then,
that
you
wish
to
leave
me?"
"Indeed
I
do,
Shirley;
and
I
don't
wish
to
leave
you.
I
shall
never
find
another
friend
so
dear."
At
which
words
Miss
Keeldar
put
her
hand
into
Caroline's
with
an
impulsively
affectionate
movement,
which
was
well
seconded
by
the
expression
of
her
face.
"If
you
think
so,
you
had
better
make
much
of
me,"
she
said,
"and
not
run
away
from
me.
I
hate
to
part
with
those
to
whom
I
am
become
attached.
Mrs.
Pryor
there
sometimes
talks
of
leaving
me,
and
says
I
might
make
a
more
advantageous
connection
than
herself.
I
should
as
soon
think
of
exchanging
an
old
fashioned
mother
for
something
modish
and
stylish.
As
for
you
why,
I
began
to
flatter
myself
we
were
thoroughly
friends;
that
you
liked
Shirley
almost
as
well
as
Shirley
likes
you,
and
she
does
not
stint
her
regard."
"I
do
like
Shirley.
I
like
her
more
and
more
every
day.
But
that
does
not
make
me
strong
or
happy."
"And
would
it
make
you
strong
or
happy
to
go
and
live
as
a
dependent
amongst
utter
strangers?
It
would
not.
And
the
experiment
must
not
be
tried;
I
tell
you
it
would
fail.
It
is
not
in
your
nature
to
bear
the
desolate
life
governesses
generally
lead;
you
would
fall
ill.
I
won't
hear
of
it."
And
Miss
Keeldar
paused,
having
uttered
this
prohibition
very
decidedly.
Soon
she
recommenced,
still
looking
somewhat
courroucee,
"Why,
it
is
my
daily
pleasure
now
to
look
out
for
the
little
cottage
bonnet
and
the
silk
scarf
glancing
through
the
trees
in
the
lane,
and
to
know
that
my
quiet,
shrewd,
thoughtful
companion
and
monitress
is
coming
back
to
me;
that
I
shall
have
her
sitting
in
the
room
to
look
at,
to
talk
to
or
to
let
alone,
as
she
and
I
please.
This
may
be
a
selfish
sort
of
language
I
know
it
is
but
it
is
the
language
which
naturally
rises
to
my
lips,
therefore
I
utter
it."
"I
would
write
to
you,
Shirley."
"And
what
are
letters?
Only
a
sort
of
pis
aller.
Drink
some
tea,
Caroline.
Eat
something
you
eat
nothing.
Laugh
and
be
cheerful,
and
stay
at
home."
Miss
Helstone
shook
her
head
and
sighed.
She
felt
what
difficulty
she
would
have
to
persuade
any
one
to
assist
or
sanction
her
in
making
that
change
in
her
life
which
she
believed
desirable.
Might
she
only
follow
her
own
judgment,
she
thought
she
should
be
able
to
find
perhaps
a
harsh
but
an
effectual
cure
for
her
sufferings.
But
this
judgment,
founded
on
circumstances
she
could
fully
explain
to
none,
least
of
all
to
Shirley,
seemed,
in
all
eyes
but
her
own,
incomprehensible
and
fantastic,
and
was
opposed
accordingly.
There
really
was
no
present
pecuniary
need
for
her
to
leave
a
comfortable
home
and
"take
a
situation;"
and
there
was
every
probability
that
her
uncle
might,
in
some
way,
permanently
provide
for
her.
So
her
friends
thought,
and,
as
far
as
their
lights
enabled
them
to
see,
they
reasoned
correctly;
but
of
Caroline's
strange
sufferings,
which
she
desired
so
eagerly
to
overcome
or
escape,
they
had
no
idea,
of
her
racked
nights
and
dismal
days
no
suspicion.
It
was
at
once
impossible
and
hopeless
to
explain;
to
wait
and
endure
was
her
only
plan.
Many
that
want
food
and
clothing
have
cheerier
lives
and
brighter
prospects
than
she
had;
many,
harassed
by
poverty,
are
in
a
strait
less
afflictive.
"Now,
is
your
mind
quieted?"
inquired
Shirley.
"Will
you
consent
to
stay
at
home?"
"I
shall
not
leave
it
against
the
approbation
of
my
friends,"
was
the
reply;
"but
I
think
in
time
they
will
be
obliged
to
think
as
I
do."
During
this
conversation
Mrs.
Pryor
looked
far
from
easy.
Her
extreme
habitual
reserve
would
rarely
permit
her
to
talk
freely
or
to
interrogate
others
closely.
She
could
think
a
multitude
of
questions
she
never
ventured
to
put,
give
advice
in
her
mind
which
her
tongue
never
delivered.
Had
she
been
alone
with
Caroline,
she
might
possibly
have
said
something
to
the
point:
Miss
Keeldar's
presence,
accustomed
as
she
was
to
it,
sealed
her
lips.
Now,
as
on
a
thousand
other
occasions,
inexplicable
nervous
scruples
kept
her
back
from
interfering.
She
merely
showed
her
concern
for
Miss
Helstone
in
an
indirect
way,
by
asking
her
if
the
fire
made
her
too
warm,
placing
a
screen
between
her
chair
and
the
hearth,
closing
a
window
whence
she
imagined
a
draught
proceeded,
and
often
and
restlessly
glancing
at
her.
Shirley
resumed:
"Having
destroyed
your
plan,"
she
said,
"which
I
hope
I
have
done,
I
shall
construct
a
new
one
of
my
own.
Every
summer
I
make
an
excursion.
This
season
I
propose
spending
two
months
either
at
the
Scotch
lochs
or
the
English
lakes
that
is,
I
shall
go
there
provided
you
consent
to
accompany
me.
If
you
refuse,
I
shall
not
stir
a
foot."
"You
are
very
good,
Shirley."
"I
would
be
very
good
if
you
would
let
me.
I
have
every
disposition
to
be
good.
It
is
my
misfortune
and
habit,
I
know,
to
think
of
myself
paramount
to
anybody
else;
but
who
is
not
like
me
in
that
respect?
However,
when
Captain
Keeldar
is
made
comfortable,
accommodated
with
all
he
wants,
including
a
sensible,
genial
comrade,
it
gives
him
a
thorough
pleasure
to
devote
his
spare
efforts
to
making
that
comrade
happy.
And
should
we
not
be
happy,
Caroline,
in
the
Highlands?
We
will
go
to
the
