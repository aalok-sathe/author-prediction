exertion.
It
was
the
blackness
the
bright
fire
leaves
when
its
blaze
is
sunk,
its
warmth
failed,
and
its
glow
faded.
"This
is
what
I
wished
to
prevent,"
she
said,
in
a
voice
whose
cadence
betrayed
the
altered
impulse
of
her
heart.
"But
you
could
not
prevent
it;
you
did
your
best
it
was
in
vain,"
said
Caroline
comfortingly.
"Don't
grieve,
Shirley."
"I
am
sorry
for
those
poor
fellows,"
was
the
answer,
while
the
spark
in
her
glance
dissolved
to
dew.
"Are
any
within
the
mill
hurt,
I
wonder?
Is
that
your
uncle?"
"It
is,
and
there
is
Mr.
Malone;
and,
O
Shirley,
there
is
Robert!"
"Well"
(resuming
her
former
tone),
"don't
squeeze
your
fingers
quite
into
my
hand.
I
see.
There
is
nothing
wonderful
in
that.
We
knew
he,
at
least,
was
here,
whoever
might
be
absent."
"He
is
coming
here
towards
us,
Shirley!"
"Towards
the
pump,
that
is
to
say,
for
the
purpose
of
washing
his
hands
and
his
forehead,
which
has
got
a
scratch,
I
perceive."
"He
bleeds,
Shirley.
Don't
hold
me.
I
must
go."
"Not
a
step."
"He
is
hurt,
Shirley!"
"Fiddlestick!"
"But
I
must
go
to
him.
I
wish
to
go
so
much.
I
cannot
bear
to
be
restrained."
"What
for?"
"To
speak
to
him,
to
ask
how
he
is,
and
what
I
can
do
for
him."
"To
tease
and
annoy
him;
to
make
a
spectacle
of
yourself
and
him
before
those
soldiers,
Mr.
Malone,
your
uncle,
et
cetera.
Would
he
like
it,
think
you?
Would
you
like
to
remember
it
a
week
hence?"
"Am
I
always
to
be
curbed
and
kept
down?"
demanded
Caroline,
a
little
passionately.
"For
his
sake,
yes;
and
still
more
for
your
own.
I
tell
you,
if
you
showed
yourself
now
you
would
repent
it
an
hour
hence,
and
so
would
Robert."
"You
think
he
would
not
like
it,
Shirley?"
"Far
less
than
he
would
like
our
stopping
him
to
say
good
night,
which
you
were
so
sore
about."
"But
that
was
all
play;
there
was
no
danger."
"And
this
is
serious
work;
he
must
be
unmolested."
"I
only
wish
to
go
to
him
because
he
is
my
cousin
you
understand?"
"I
quite
understand.
But
now,
watch
him.
He
has
bathed
his
forehead,
and
the
blood
has
ceased
trickling.
His
hurt
is
really
a
mere
graze;
I
can
see
it
from
hence.
He
is
going
to
look
after
the
wounded
men."
Accordingly
Mr.
Moore
and
Mr.
Helstone
went
round
the
yard,
examining
each
prostrate
form.
They
then
gave
directions
to
have
the
wounded
taken
up
and
carried
into
the
mill.
This
duty
being
performed,
Joe
Scott
was
ordered
to
saddle
his
master's
horse
and
Mr.
Helstone's
pony,
and
the
two
gentlemen
rode
away
full
gallop,
to
seek
surgical
aid
in
different
directions.
Caroline
was
not
yet
pacified.
"Shirley,
Shirley,
I
should
have
liked
to
speak
one
word
to
him
before
he
went,"
she
murmured,
while
the
tears
gathered
glittering
in
her
eyes.
"Why
do
you
cry,
Lina?"
asked
Miss
Keeldar
a
little
sternly.
"You
ought
to
be
glad
instead
of
sorry.
Robert
has
escaped
any
serious
harm;
he
is
victorious;
he
has
been
cool
and
brave
in
combat;
he
is
now
considerate
in
triumph.
Is
this
a
time
are
these
causes
for
weeping?"
"You
do
not
know
what
I
have
in
my
heart,"
pleaded
the
other
"what
pain,
what
distraction
nor
whence
it
arises.
I
can
understand
that
you
should
exult
in
Robert's
greatness
and
goodness;
so
do
I,
in
one
sense,
but
in
another
I
feel
so
miserable.
I
am
too
far
removed
from
him.
I
used
to
be
nearer.
Let
me
alone,
Shirley.
Do
let
me
cry
a
few
minutes;
it
relieves
me."
Miss
Keeldar,
feeling
her
tremble
in
every
limb,
ceased
to
expostulate
with
her.
She
went
out
of
the
shed,
and
left
her
to
weep
in
peace.
It
was
the
best
plan.
In
a
few
minutes
Caroline
rejoined
her,
much
calmer.
She
said,
with
her
natural,
docile,
gentle
manner,
"Come,
Shirley,
we
will
go
home
now.
I
promise
not
to
try
to
see
Robert
again
till
he
asks
for
me.
I
never
will
try
to
push
myself
on
him.
I
thank
you
for
restraining
me
just
now."
"I
did
it
with
a
good
intention,"
returned
Miss
Keeldar.
"Now,
dear
Lina,"
she
continued,
"let
us
turn
our
faces
to
the
cool
morning
breeze,
and
walk
very
quietly
back
to
the
rectory.
We
will
steal
in
as
we
stole
out.
None
shall
know
where
we
have
been
or
what
we
have
seen
to
night;
neither
taunt
nor
misconstruction
can
consequently
molest
us.
To
morrow
we
will
see
Robert,
and
be
of
good
cheer;
but
I
will
say
no
more,
lest
I
should
begin
to
cry
too.
I
seem
hard
towards
you,
but
I
am
not
so."
The
two
girls
met
no
living
soul
on
their
way
back
to
the
rectory.
They
let
themselves
in
noiselessly;
they
stole
upstairs
unheard
the
breaking
morning
gave
them
what
light
they
needed.
Shirley
sought
her
couch
immediately;
and
though
the
room
was
strange
for
she
had
never
slept
at
the
rectory
before
and
though
the
recent
scene
was
one
unparalleled
for
excitement
and
terror
by
any
it
had
hitherto
been
her
lot
to
witness,
yet
scarce
was
her
head
laid
on
the
pillow
ere
a
deep,
refreshing
sleep
closed
her
eyes
and
calmed
her
senses.
Perfect
health
was
Shirley's
enviable
portion.
Though
warm
hearted
and
sympathetic,
she
was
not
nervous;
powerful
emotions
could
rouse
and
sway
without
exhausting
her
spirit.
The
tempest
troubled
and
shook
her
while
it
lasted,
but
it
left
her
elasticity
unbent,
and
her
freshness
quite
unblighted.
As
every
day
brought
her
stimulating
emotion,
so
every
night
yielded
her
recreating
rest.
Caroline
now
watched
her
sleeping,
and
read
the
serenity
of
her
mind
in
the
beauty
of
her
happy
countenance.
For
herself,
being
of
a
different
temperament,
she
could
not
sleep.
The
commonplace
excitement
of
the
tea
drinking
and
school
gathering
would
alone
have
sufficed
to
make
her
restless
