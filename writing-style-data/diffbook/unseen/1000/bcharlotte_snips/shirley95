the
parlour
before
Miss
Keeldar.
He
glanced
at
Miss
Helstone;
he
could
scarcely
bring
himself
to
bend
to
her.
He
glared
on
both
the
ladies.
He
looked
as
if,
had
either
of
them
been
his
wife,
he
would
have
made
a
glorious
husband
at
the
moment.
In
each
hand
he
seemed
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
clutch
one
and
gripe
her
to
death.
However,
Shirley
took
pity.
She
ceased
to
laugh;
and
Caroline
was
too
true
a
lady
to
smile
even
at
any
one
under
mortification.
Tartar
was
dismissed;
Peter
Augustus
was
soothed
for
Shirley
had
looks
and
tones
that
might
soothe
a
very
bull.
He
had
sense
to
feel
that,
since
he
could
not
challenge
the
owner
of
the
dog,
he
had
better
be
civil.
And
civil
he
tried
to
be;
and
his
attempts
being
well
received,
he
grew
presently
very
civil
and
quite
himself
again.
He
had
come,
indeed,
for
the
express
purpose
of
making
himself
charming
and
fascinating.
Rough
portents
had
met
him
on
his
first
admission
to
Fieldhead;
but
that
passage
got
over,
charming
and
fascinating
he
resolved
to
be.
Like
March,
having
come
in
like
a
lion,
he
purposed
to
go
out
like
a
lamb.
For
the
sake
of
air,
as
it
appeared,
or
perhaps
for
that
of
ready
exit
in
case
of
some
new
emergency
arising,
he
took
his
seat,
not
on
the
sofa,
where
Miss
Keeldar
offered
him
enthronization,
nor
yet
near
the
fireside,
to
which
Caroline,
by
a
friendly
sign,
gently
invited
him,
but
on
a
chair
close
to
the
door.
Being
no
longer
sullen
or
furious,
he
grew,
after
his
fashion,
constrained
and
embarrassed.
He
talked
to
the
ladies
by
fits
and
starts,
choosing
for
topics
whatever
was
most
intensely
commonplace.
He
sighed
deeply,
significantly,
at
the
close
of
every
sentence;
he
sighed
in
each
pause;
he
sighed
ere
he
opened
his
mouth.
At
last,
finding
it
desirable
to
add
ease
to
his
other
charms,
he
drew
forth
to
aid
him
an
ample
silk
pocket
handkerchief.
This
was
to
be
the
graceful
toy
with
which
his
unoccupied
hands
were
to
trifle.
He
went
to
work
with
a
certain
energy.
He
folded
the
red
and
yellow
square
cornerwise;
he
whipped
it
open
with
a
waft;
again
he
folded
it
in
narrower
compass;
he
made
of
it
a
handsome
band.
To
what
purpose
would
he
proceed
to
apply
the
ligature?
Would
he
wrap
it
about
his
throat
his
head?
Should
it
be
a
comforter
or
a
turban?
Neither.
Peter
Augustus
had
an
inventive,
an
original
genius.
He
was
about
to
show
the
ladies
graces
of
action
possessing
at
least
the
charm
of
novelty.
He
sat
on
the
chair
with
his
athletic
Irish
legs
crossed,
and
these
legs,
in
that
attitude,
he
circled
with
the
bandana
and
bound
firmly
together.
It
was
evident
he
felt
this
device
to
be
worth
an
encore;
he
repeated
it
more
than
once.
The
second
performance
sent
Shirley
to
the
window,
to
laugh
her
silent
but
irrepressible
laugh
unseen;
it
turned
Caroline's
head
aside,
that
her
long
curls
might
screen
the
smile
mantling
on
her
features.
Miss
Helstone,
indeed,
was
amused
by
more
than
one
point
in
Peter's
demeanour.
She
was
edified
at
the
complete
though
abrupt
diversion
of
his
homage
from
herself
to
the
heiress.
The
5,000
he
supposed
her
likely
one
day
to
inherit
were
not
to
be
weighed
in
the
balance
against
Miss
Keeldar's
estate
and
hall.
He
took
no
pains
to
conceal
his
calculations
and
tactics.
He
pretended
to
no
gradual
change
of
views;
he
wheeled
about
at
once.
The
pursuit
of
the
lesser
fortune
was
openly
relinquished
for
that
of
the
greater.
On
what
grounds
he
expected
to
succeed
in
his
chase
himself
best
knew;
certainly
not
by
skilful
management.
From
the
length
of
time
that
elapsed,
it
appeared
that
John
had
some
difficulty
in
persuading
Mr.
Donne
to
descend.
At
length,
however,
that
gentleman
appeared;
nor,
as
he
presented
himself
at
the
oak
parlour
door,
did
he
seem
in
the
slightest
degree
ashamed
or
confused
not
a
whit.
Donne,
indeed,
was
of
that
coldly
phlegmatic,
immovably
complacent,
densely
self
satisfied
nature
which
is
insensible
to
shame.
He
had
never
blushed
in
his
life;
no
humiliation
could
abash
him;
his
nerves
were
not
capable
of
sensation
enough
to
stir
his
life
and
make
colour
mount
to
his
cheek;
he
had
no
fire
in
his
blood
and
no
modesty
in
his
soul;
he
was
a
frontless,
arrogant,
decorous
slip
of
the
commonplace
conceited,
inane,
insipid;
and
this
gentleman
had
a
notion
of
wooing
Miss
Keeldar!
He
knew
no
more,
however,
how
to
set
about
the
business
than
if
he
had
been
an
image
carved
in
wood.
He
had
no
idea
of
a
taste
to
be
pleased,
a
heart
to
be
reached
in
courtship.
His
notion
was,
when
he
should
have
formally
visited
her
a
few
times,
to
write
a
letter
proposing
marriage.
Then
he
calculated
she
would
accept
him
for
love
of
his
office;
then
they
would
be
married;
then
he
should
be
master
of
Fieldhead;
and
he
should
live
very
comfortably,
have
servants
at
his
command,
eat
and
drink
of
the
best,
and
be
a
great
man.
You
would
not
have
suspected
his
intentions
when
he
addressed
his
intended
bride
in
an
impertinent,
injured
tone
"A
very
dangerous
dog
that,
Miss
Keeldar.
I
wonder
you
should
keep
such
an
animal."
"Do
you,
Mr.
Donne?
Perhaps
you
will
wonder
more
when
I
tell
you
I
am
very
fond
of
him."
"I
should
say
you
are
not
serious
in
the
assertion.
Can't
fancy
a
lady
fond
of
that
brute
'tis
so
ugly
a
mere
carter's
dog.
Pray
hang
him."
"Hang
what
I
am
fond
of!"
"And
purchase
in
his
stead
some
sweetly
pooty
pug
or
poodle
something
appropriate
to
the
fair
sex.
Ladies
generally
like
lap
dogs."
"Perhaps
I
am
an
exception."
"Oh,
you
can't
be,
you
know.
All
ladies
are
alike
in
those
matters.
That
is
universally
allowed."
"Tartar
frightened
you
terribly,
Mr.
