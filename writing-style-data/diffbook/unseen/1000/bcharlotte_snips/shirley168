lingered
on
the
countenance,
in
the
manner
of
Miss
Keeldar.
A
strange
quietude
settled
over
her
look,
her
movements,
her
very
voice.
The
alteration
was
not
so
marked
as
to
court
or
permit
frequent
questioning,
yet
it
was
there,
and
it
would
not
pass
away.
It
hung
over
her
like
a
cloud
which
no
breeze
could
stir
or
disperse.
Soon
it
became
evident
that
to
notice
this
change
was
to
annoy
her.
First
she
shrank
from
remark;
and,
if
persisted
in,
she,
with
her
own
peculiar
hauteur,
repelled
it.
"Was
she
ill?"
The
reply
came
with
decision.
"I
am
not."
"Did
anything
weigh
on
her
mind?
Had
anything
happened
to
affect
her
spirits?"
She
scornfully
ridiculed
the
idea.
"What
did
they
mean
by
spirits?
She
had
no
spirits,
black
or
white,
blue
or
gray,
to
affect."
"Something
must
be
the
matter
she
was
so
altered."
"She
supposed
she
had
a
right
to
alter
at
her
ease.
She
knew
she
was
plainer.
If
it
suited
her
to
grow
ugly,
why
need
others
fret
themselves
on
the
subject?"
"There
must
be
a
cause
for
the
change.
What
was
it?"
She
peremptorily
requested
to
be
let
alone.
Then
she
would
make
every
effort
to
appear
quite
gay,
and
she
seemed
indignant
at
herself
that
she
could
not
perfectly
succeed.
Brief
self
spurning
epithets
burst
from
her
lips
when
alone.
"Fool!
coward!"
she
would
term
herself.
"Poltroon!"
she
would
say,
"if
you
must
tremble,
tremble
in
secret!
Quail
where
no
eye
sees
you!"
"How
dare
you,"
she
would
ask
herself
"how
dare
you
show
your
weakness
and
betray
your
imbecile
anxieties?
Shake
them
off;
rise
above
them.
If
you
cannot
do
this,
hide
them."
And
to
hide
them
she
did
her
best.
She
once
more
became
resolutely
lively
in
company.
When
weary
of
effort
and
forced
to
relax,
she
sought
solitude
not
the
solitude
of
her
chamber
(she
refused
to
mope,
shut
up
between
four
walls),
but
that
wilder
solitude
which
lies
out
of
doors,
and
which
she
could
chase,
mounted
on
Zoe,
her
mare.
She
took
long
rides
of
half
a
day.
Her
uncle
disapproved,
but
he
dared
not
remonstrate.
It
was
never
pleasant
to
face
Shirley's
anger,
even
when
she
was
healthy
and
gay;
but
now
that
her
face
showed
thin,
and
her
large
eye
looked
hollow,
there
was
something
in
the
darkening
of
that
face
and
kindling
of
that
eye
which
touched
as
well
as
alarmed.
To
all
comparative
strangers
who,
unconscious
of
the
alterations
in
her
spirits,
commented
on
the
alteration
in
her
looks,
she
had
one
reply,
"I
am
perfectly
well;
I
have
not
an
ailment."
And
health,
indeed,
she
must
have
had,
to
be
able
to
bear
the
exposure
to
the
weather
she
now
encountered.
Wet
or
fair,
calm
or
storm,
she
took
her
daily
ride
over
Stilbro'
Moor,
Tartar
keeping
up
at
her
side,
with
his
wolf
like
gallop,
long
and
untiring.
Twice,
three
times,
the
eyes
of
gossips
those
eyes
which
are
everywhere,
in
the
closet
and
on
the
hill
top
noticed
that
instead
of
turning
on
Rushedge,
the
top
ridge
of
Stilbro'
Moor,
she
rode
forwards
all
the
way
to
the
town.
Scouts
were
not
wanting
to
mark
her
destination
there.
It
was
ascertained
that
she
alighted
at
the
door
of
one
Mr.
Pearson
Hall,
a
solicitor,
related
to
the
vicar
of
Nunnely.
This
gentleman
and
his
ancestors
had
been
the
agents
of
the
Keeldar
family
for
generations
back.
Some
people
affirmed
that
Miss
Keeldar
was
become
involved
in
business
speculations
connected
with
Hollow's
Mill
that
she
had
lost
money,
and
was
constrained
to
mortgage
her
land.
Others
conjectured
that
she
was
going
to
be
married,
and
that
the
settlements
were
preparing.
Mr.
Moore
and
Henry
Sympson
were
together
in
the
schoolroom.
The
tutor
was
waiting
for
a
lesson
which
the
pupil
seemed
busy
in
preparing.
"Henry,
make
haste.
The
afternoon
is
getting
on."
"Is
it,
sir?"
"Certainly.
Are
you
nearly
ready
with
that
lesson?"
"No."
"Not
nearly
ready?"
"I
have
not
construed
a
line."
Mr.
Moore
looked
up.
The
boy's
tone
was
rather
peculiar.
"The
task
presents
no
difficulties,
Henry;
or,
if
it
does,
bring
them
to
me.
We
will
work
together."
"Mr.
Moore,
I
can
do
no
work."
"My
boy,
you
are
ill."
"Sir,
I
am
not
worse
in
bodily
health
than
usual,
but
my
heart
is
full."
"Shut
the
book.
Come
hither,
Harry.
Come
to
the
fireside."
Harry
limped
forward.
His
tutor
placed
him
in
a
chair;
his
lips
were
quivering,
his
eyes
brimming.
He
laid
his
crutch
on
the
floor,
bent
down
his
head,
and
wept.
"This
distress
is
not
occasioned
by
physical
pain,
you
say,
Harry?
You
have
a
grief;
tell
it
me."
"Sir,
I
have
such
a
grief
as
I
never
had
before.
I
wish
it
could
be
relieved
in
some
way;
I
can
hardly
bear
it."
"Who
knows
but,
if
we
talk
it
over,
we
may
relieve
it?
What
is
the
cause?
Whom
does
it
concern?"
"The
cause,
sir,
is
Shirley;
it
concerns
Shirley."
"Does
it?
You
think
her
changed?"
"All
who
know
her
think
her
changed
you
too,
Mr.
Moore."
"Not
seriously
no.
I
see
no
alteration
but
such
as
a
favourable
turn
might
repair
in
a
few
weeks;
besides,
her
own
word
must
go
for
something:
she
says
she
is
well."
"There
it
is,
sir.
As
long
as
she
maintained
she
was
well,
I
believed
her.
When
I
was
sad
out
of
her
sight,
I
soon
recovered
spirits
in
her
presence.
Now
"
"Well,
Harry,
now.
Has
she
said
anything
to
you?
You
and
she
were
together
in
the
garden
two
hours
this
morning.
I
saw
her
talking,
and
you
listening.
Now,
my
dear
Harry,
if
Miss
Keeldar
has
said
she
is
ill,
and
enjoined
you
to
keep
her
secret,
do
not
obey
her.
For
her
life's
sake,
avow
everything.
Speak,
my
boy."
"She
say
she
is
ill!
I
believe,
sir,
if
she
were
dying,
she
would
smile,
and
aver,
'Nothing
ails
me.'"
"What
have
you
