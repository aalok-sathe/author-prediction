had
spent
with
him
in
a
great
town
somewhere,
when
she
had
had
no
maid
to
dress
her
or
take
care
of
her;
when
she
had
been
shut
up,
day
and
night,
in
a
high
garret
room,
without
a
carpet,
with
a
bare
uncurtained
bed,
and
scarcely
any
other
furniture;
when
he
went
out
early
every
morning,
and
often
forgot
to
return
and
give
her
her
dinner
during
the
day,
and
at
night,
when
he
came
back,
was
like
a
madman,
furious,
terrible,
or
still
more
painful
like
an
idiot,
imbecile,
senseless.
She
knew
she
had
fallen
ill
in
this
place,
and
that
one
night,
when
she
was
very
sick
he
had
come
raving
into
the
room,
and
said
he
would
kill
her,
for
she
was
a
burden
to
him.
Her
screams
had
brought
aid;
and
from
the
moment
she
was
then
rescued
from
him
she
had
never
seen
him,
except
as
a
dead
man
in
his
coffin.
That
was
her
father.
Also
she
had
a
mother,
though
Mr.
Helstone
never
spoke
to
her
of
that
mother,
though
she
could
not
remember
having
seen
her;
but
that
she
was
alive
she
knew.
This
mother
was
then
the
drunkard's
wife.
What
had
their
marriage
been?
Caroline,
turning
from
the
lattice,
whence
she
had
been
watching
the
starlings
(though
without
seeing
them),
in
a
low
voice,
and
with
a
sad,
bitter
tone,
thus
broke
the
silence
of
the
room,
"You
term
marriage
miserable,
I
suppose,
from
what
you
saw
of
my
father
and
mother's.
If
my
mother
suffered
what
I
suffered
when
I
was
with
papa,
she
must
have
had
a
dreadful
life."
Mr.
Helstone,
thus
addressed,
wheeled
about
in
his
chair,
and
looked
over
his
spectacles
at
his
niece.
He
was
taken
aback.
Her
father
and
mother!
What
had
put
it
into
her
head
to
mention
her
father
and
mother,
of
whom
he
had
never,
during
the
twelve
years
she
had
lived
with
him,
spoken
to
her?
That
the
thoughts
were
self
matured,
that
she
had
any
recollections
or
speculations
about
her
parents,
he
could
not
fancy.
"Your
father
and
mother?
Who
has
been
talking
to
you
about
them?"
"Nobody;
but
I
remember
something
of
what
papa
was,
and
I
pity
mamma.
Where
is
she?"
This
"Where
is
she?"
had
been
on
Caroline's
lips
hundreds
of
times
before,
but
till
now
she
had
never
uttered
it.
"I
hardly
know,"
returned
Mr.
Helstone;
"I
was
little
acquainted
with
her.
I
have
not
heard
from
her
for
years:
but
wherever
she
is,
she
thinks
nothing
of
you;
she
never
inquires
about
you.
I
have
reason
to
believe
she
does
not
wish
to
see
you.
Come,
it
is
school
time.
You
go
to
your
cousin
at
ten,
don't
you?
The
clock
has
struck."
Perhaps
Caroline
would
have
said
more;
but
Fanny,
coming
in,
informed
her
master
that
the
churchwardens
wanted
to
speak
to
him
in
the
vestry.
He
hastened
to
join
them,
and
his
niece
presently
set
out
for
the
cottage.
The
road
from
the
rectory
to
Hollow's
Mill
inclined
downwards;
she
ran,
therefore,
almost
all
the
way.
Exercise,
the
fresh
air,
the
thought
of
seeing
Robert,
at
least
of
being
on
his
premises,
in
his
vicinage,
revived
her
somewhat
depressed
spirits
quickly.
Arriving
in
sight
of
the
white
house,
and
within
hearing
of
the
thundering
mill
and
its
rushing
watercourse,
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
Moore
at
his
garden
gate.
There
he
stood,
in
his
belted
Holland
blouse,
a
light
cap
covering
his
head,
which
undress
costume
suited
him.
He
was
looking
down
the
lane,
not
in
the
direction
of
his
cousin's
approach.
She
stopped,
withdrawing
a
little
behind
a
willow,
and
studied
his
appearance.
"He
has
not
his
peer,"
she
thought.
"He
is
as
handsome
as
he
is
intelligent.
What
a
keen
eye
he
has!
What
clearly
cut,
spirited
features
thin
and
serious,
but
graceful!
I
do
like
his
face,
I
do
like
his
aspect,
I
do
like
him
so
much
better
than
any
of
those
shuffling
curates,
for
instance
better
than
anybody;
bonny
Robert!"
She
sought
"bonny
Robert's"
presence
speedily.
For
his
part,
when
she
challenged
his
sight,
I
believe
he
would
have
passed
from
before
her
eyes
like
a
phantom,
if
he
could;
but
being
a
tall
fact,
and
no
fiction,
he
was
obliged
to
stand
the
greeting.
He
made
it
brief.
It
was
cousin
like,
brother
like,
friend
like,
anything
but
lover
like.
The
nameless
charm
of
last
night
had
left
his
manner:
he
was
no
longer
the
same
man:
or,
at
any
rate,
the
same
heart
did
not
beat
in
his
breast.
Rude
disappointment,
sharp
cross!
At
first
the
eager
girl
would
not
believe
in
the
change,
though
she
saw
and
felt
it.
It
was
difficult
to
withdraw
her
hand
from
his,
till
he
had
bestowed
at
least
something
like
a
kind
pressure;
it
was
difficult
to
turn
her
eyes
from
his
eyes,
till
his
looks
had
expressed
something
more
and
fonder
than
that
cool
welcome.
A
lover
masculine
so
disappointed
can
speak
and
urge
explanation,
a
lover
feminine
can
say
nothing;
if
she
did,
the
result
would
be
shame
and
anguish,
inward
remorse
for
self
treachery.
Nature
would
brand
such
demonstration
as
a
rebellion
against
her
instincts,
and
would
vindictively
repay
it
afterwards
by
the
thunderbolt
of
self
contempt
smiting
suddenly
in
secret.
Take
the
matter
as
you
find
it:
ask
no
questions,
utter
no
remonstrances;
it
is
your
best
wisdom.
You
expected
bread,
and
you
have
got
a
stone:
break
your
teeth
on
it,
and
don't
shriek
because
the
nerves
are
martyrized;
do
not
doubt
that
your
mental
stomach
if
you
have
such
a
thing
is
strong
as
an
ostrich's;
the
stone
will
digest.
You
held
out
your
hand
for
an
egg,
and
fate
put
into
it
a
scorpion.
Show
no
consternation:
close
your
fingers
firmly
upon
the
gift;
let
it
sting
through
your
palm.
Never
mind;
in
time,
after
your
hand
and
arm
have
swelled
and
quivered
long
with
torture,
the
squeezed
scorpion
will
