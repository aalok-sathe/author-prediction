you."
"My
cousin
Robert
not
Mr.
Moore."
"Not
a
bit
of
Mr.
Moore.
Caroline
"
Here
the
company
was
heard
rising
in
the
other
room.
The
door
was
opened;
the
pony
carriage
was
ordered;
shawls
and
bonnets
were
demanded;
Mr.
Helstone
called
for
his
niece.
"I
must
go,
Robert."
"Yes,
you
must
go,
or
they
will
come
in
and
find
us
here;
and
I,
rather
than
meet
all
that
host
in
the
passage,
will
take
my
departure
through
the
window.
Luckily
it
opens
like
a
door.
One
minute
only
put
down
the
candle
an
instant
good
night.
I
kiss
you
because
we
are
cousins,
and,
being
cousins,
one
two
three
kisses
are
allowable.
Caroline,
good
night."
The
next
day
Moore
had
risen
before
the
sun,
and
had
taken
a
ride
to
Whinbury
and
back
ere
his
sister
had
made
the
cafe
au
lait
or
cut
the
tartines
for
his
breakfast.
What
business
he
transacted
there
he
kept
to
himself.
Hortense
asked
no
questions:
it
was
not
her
wont
to
comment
on
his
movements,
nor
his
to
render
an
account
of
them.
The
secrets
of
business
complicated
and
often
dismal
mysteries
were
buried
in
his
breast,
and
never
came
out
of
their
sepulchre
save
now
and
then
to
scare
Joe
Scott,
or
give
a
start
to
some
foreign
correspondent.
Indeed,
a
general
habit
of
reserve
on
whatever
was
important
seemed
bred
in
his
mercantile
blood.
Breakfast
over,
he
went
to
his
counting
house.
Henry,
Joe
Scott's
boy,
brought
in
the
letters
and
the
daily
papers;
Moore
seated
himself
at
his
desk,
broke
the
seals
of
the
documents,
and
glanced
them
over.
They
were
all
short,
but
not,
it
seemed,
sweet
probably
rather
sour,
on
the
contrary,
for
as
Moore
laid
down
the
last,
his
nostrils
emitted
a
derisive
and
defiant
snuff,
and
though
he
burst
into
no
soliloquy,
there
was
a
glance
in
his
eye
which
seemed
to
invoke
the
devil,
and
lay
charges
on
him
to
sweep
the
whole
concern
to
Gehenna.
However,
having
chosen
a
pen
and
stripped
away
the
feathered
top
in
a
brief
spasm
of
finger
fury
(only
finger
fury
his
face
was
placid),
he
dashed
off
a
batch
of
answers,
sealed
them,
and
then
went
out
and
walked
through
the
mill.
On
coming
back
he
sat
down
to
read
his
newspaper.
The
contents
seemed
not
absorbingly
interesting;
he
more
than
once
laid
it
across
his
knee,
folded
his
arms,
and
gazed
into
the
fire;
he
occasionally
turned
his
head
towards
the
window;
he
looked
at
intervals
at
his
watch;
in
short,
his
mind
appeared
preoccupied.
Perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
the
beauty
of
the
weather
for
it
was
a
fine
and
mild
morning
for
the
season
and
wishing
to
be
out
in
the
fields
enjoying
it.
The
door
of
his
counting
house
stood
wide
open.
The
breeze
and
sunshine
entered
freely;
but
the
first
visitant
brought
no
spring
perfume
on
its
wings,
only
an
occasional
sulphur
puff
from
the
soot
thick
column
of
smoke
rushing
sable
from
the
gaunt
mill
chimney.
A
dark
blue
apparition
(that
of
Joe
Scott,
fresh
from
a
dyeing
vat)
appeared
momentarily
at
the
open
door,
uttered
the
words
"He's
comed,
sir,"
and
vanished.
Mr.
Moore
raised
not
his
eyes
from
the
paper.
A
large
man,
broad
shouldered
and
massive
limbed,
clad
in
fustian
garments
and
gray
worsted
stockings,
entered,
who
was
received
with
a
nod,
and
desired
to
take
a
seat,
which
he
did,
making
the
remark,
as
he
removed
his
hat
(a
very
bad
one),
stowed
it
away
under
his
chair,
and
wiped
his
forehead
with
a
spotted
cotton
handkerchief
extracted
from
the
hat
crown,
that
it
was
"raight
dahn
warm
for
Febewerry."
Mr.
Moore
assented
at
least
he
uttered
some
slight
sound,
which,
though
inarticulate,
might
pass
for
an
assent.
The
visitor
now
carefully
deposited
in
the
corner
beside
him
an
official
looking
staff
which
he
bore
in
his
hand;
this
done,
he
whistled,
probably
by
way
of
appearing
at
his
ease.
"You
have
what
is
necessary,
I
suppose?"
said
Mr.
Moore.
"Ay,
ay!
all's
right."
He
renewed
his
whistling,
Mr.
Moore
his
reading.
The
paper
apparently
had
become
more
interesting.
Presently,
however,
he
turned
to
his
cupboard,
which
was
within
reach
of
his
long
arm,
opened
it
without
rising,
took
out
a
black
bottle
the
same
he
had
produced
for
Malone's
benefit
a
tumbler,
and
a
jug,
placed
them
on
the
table,
and
said
to
his
guest,
"Help
yourself;
there's
water
in
that
jar
in
the
corner."
"I
dunnut
knaw
that
there's
mich
need,
for
all
a
body
is
dry
(thirsty)
in
a
morning,"
said
the
fustian
gentleman,
rising
and
doing
as
requested.
"Will
you
tak
naught
yourseln,
Mr.
Moore?"
he
inquired,
as
with
skilled
hand
he
mixed
a
portion,
and
having
tested
it
by
a
deep
draught,
sank
back
satisfied
and
bland
in
his
seat.
Moore,
chary
of
words,
replied
by
a
negative
movement
and
murmur.
"Yah'd
as
good,"
continued
his
visitor;
"it
'uld
set
ye
up
wald
a
sup
o'
this
stuff.
Uncommon
good
hollands.
Ye
get
it
fro'
furrin
parts,
I'se
think?"
"Ay!"
"Tak
my
advice
and
try
a
glass
on't.
Them
lads
'at's
coming
'll
keep
ye
talking,
nob'dy
knows
how
long.
Ye'll
need
propping."
"Have
you
seen
Mr.
Sykes
this
morning?"
inquired
Moore.
"I
seed
him
a
hauf
an
hour
nay,
happen
a
quarter
of
an
hour
sin',
just
afore
I
set
off.
He
said
he
aimed
to
come
here,
and
I
sudn't
wonder
but
ye'll
have
old
Helstone
too.
I
seed
'em
saddling
his
little
nag
as
I
passed
at
back
o'
t'
rectory."
The
speaker
was
a
true
prophet,
for
the
trot
of
a
little
nag's
hoofs
was,
five
minutes
after,
heard
in
the
yard.
It
stopped,
and
a
well
known
nasal
voice
cried
aloud,
"Boy"
(probably
addressing
Harry
Scott,
who
usually
hung
about
the
premises
from
9
a.m.
to
5
p.m.),
"take
my
horse
and
lead
him
into
the
stable."
Helstone
came
in
marching
nimbly
and
erect,
looking
browner,
keener,
