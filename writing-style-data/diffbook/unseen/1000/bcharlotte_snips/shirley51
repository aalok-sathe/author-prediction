she
agreed
perfectly
well,
yet
he
was
naturally
a
social,
hospitable
man,
an
advocate
for
family
unity;
and
in
his
youth,
as
has
been
said,
he
liked
none
but
lively,
cheerful
women.
Why
he
chose
her,
how
they
contrived
to
suit
each
other,
is
a
problem
puzzling
enough,
but
which
might
soon
be
solved
if
one
had
time
to
go
into
the
analysis
of
the
case.
Suffice
it
here
to
say
that
Yorke
had
a
shadowy
side
as
well
as
a
sunny
side
to
his
character,
and
that
his
shadowy
side
found
sympathy
and
affinity
in
the
whole
of
his
wife's
uniformly
overcast
nature.
For
the
rest,
she
was
a
strong
minded
woman;
never
said
a
weak
or
a
trite
thing;
took
stern,
democratic
views
of
society,
and
rather
cynical
ones
of
human
nature;
considered
herself
perfect
and
safe,
and
the
rest
of
the
world
all
wrong.
Her
main
fault
was
a
brooding,
eternal,
immitigable
suspicion
of
all
men,
things,
creeds,
and
parties;
this
suspicion
was
a
mist
before
her
eyes,
a
false
guide
in
her
path,
wherever
she
looked,
wherever
she
turned.
It
may
be
supposed
that
the
children
of
such
a
pair
were
not
likely
to
turn
out
quite
ordinary,
commonplace
beings;
and
they
were
not.
You
see
six
of
them,
reader.
The
youngest
is
a
baby
on
the
mother's
knee.
It
is
all
her
own
yet,
and
that
one
she
has
not
yet
begun
to
doubt,
suspect,
condemn;
it
derives
its
sustenance
from
her,
it
hangs
on
her,
it
clings
to
her,
it
loves
her
above
everything
else
in
the
world.
She
is
sure
of
that,
because,
as
it
lives
by
her,
it
cannot
be
otherwise,
therefore
she
loves
it.
The
two
next
are
girls,
Rose
and
Jessy;
they
are
both
now
at
their
father's
knee;
they
seldom
go
near
their
mother,
except
when
obliged
to
do
so.
Rose,
the
elder,
is
twelve
years
old;
she
is
like
her
father
the
most
like
him
of
the
whole
group
but
it
is
a
granite
head
copied
in
ivory;
all
is
softened
in
colour
and
line.
Yorke
himself
has
a
harsh
face
his
daughter's
is
not
harsh,
neither
is
it
quite
pretty;
it
is
simple,
childlike
in
feature;
the
round
cheeks
bloom:
as
to
the
gray
eyes,
they
are
otherwise
than
childlike;
a
serious
soul
lights
them
a
young
soul
yet,
but
it
will
mature,
if
the
body
lives;
and
neither
father
nor
mother
have
a
spirit
to
compare
with
it.
Partaking
of
the
essence
of
each,
it
will
one
day
be
better
than
either
stronger,
much
purer,
more
aspiring.
Rose
is
a
still,
sometimes
a
stubborn,
girl
now.
Her
mother
wants
to
make
of
her
such
a
woman
as
she
is
herself
a
woman
of
dark
and
dreary
duties;
and
Rose
has
a
mind
full
set,
thick
sown
with
the
germs
of
ideas
her
mother
never
knew.
It
is
agony
to
her
often
to
have
these
ideas
trampled
on
and
repressed.
She
has
never
rebelled
yet;
but
if
hard
driven,
she
will
rebel
one
day,
and
then
it
will
be
once
for
all.
Rose
loves
her
father:
her
father
does
not
rule
her
with
a
rod
of
iron;
he
is
good
to
her.
He
sometimes
fears
she
will
not
live,
so
bright
are
the
sparks
of
intelligence
which,
at
moments,
flash
from
her
glance
and
gleam
in
her
language.
This
idea
makes
him
often
sadly
tender
to
her.
He
has
no
idea
that
little
Jessy
will
die
young,
she
is
so
gay
and
chattering,
arch,
original
even
now;
passionate
when
provoked,
but
most
affectionate
if
caressed;
by
turns
gentle
and
rattling;
exacting,
yet
generous;
fearless
of
her
mother,
for
instance,
whose
irrationally
hard
and
strict
rule
she
has
often
defied
yet
reliant
on
any
who
will
help
her.
Jessy,
with
her
little
piquant
face,
engaging
prattle,
and
winning
ways,
is
made
to
be
a
pet,
and
her
father's
pet
she
accordingly
is.
It
is
odd
that
the
doll
should
resemble
her
mother
feature
by
feature,
as
Rose
resembles
her
father,
and
yet
the
physiognomy
how
different!
Mr.
Yorke,
if
a
magic
mirror
were
now
held
before
you,
and
if
therein
were
shown
you
your
two
daughters
as
they
will
be
twenty
years
from
this
night,
what
would
you
think?
The
magic
mirror
is
here:
you
shall
learn
their
destinies
and
first
that
of
your
little
life,
Jessy.
Do
you
know
this
place?
No,
you
never
saw
it;
but
you
recognize
the
nature
of
these
trees,
this
foliage
the
cypress,
the
willow,
the
yew.
Stone
crosses
like
these
are
not
unfamiliar
to
you,
nor
are
these
dim
garlands
of
everlasting
flowers.
Here
is
the
place
green
sod
and
a
gray
marble
headstone.
Jessy
sleeps
below.
She
lived
through
an
April
day;
much
loved
was
she,
much
loving.
She
often,
in
her
brief
life,
shed
tears,
she
had
frequent
sorrows;
she
smiled
between,
gladdening
whatever
saw
her.
Her
death
was
tranquil
and
happy
in
Rose's
guardian
arms,
for
Rose
had
been
her
stay
and
defence
through
many
trials.
The
dying
and
the
watching
English
girls
were
at
that
hour
alone
in
a
foreign
country,
and
the
soil
of
that
country
gave
Jessy
a
grave.
Now,
behold
Rose
two
years
later.
The
crosses
and
garlands
looked
strange,
but
the
hills
and
woods
of
this
landscape
look
still
stranger.
This,
indeed,
is
far
from
England;
remote
must
be
the
shores
which
wear
that
wild,
luxuriant
aspect.
This
is
some
virgin
solitude.
Unknown
birds
flutter
round
the
skirts
of
that
forest;
no
European
river
this,
on
whose
banks
Rose
sits
thinking.
The
little
quiet
Yorkshire
girl
is
a
lonely
emigrant
in
some
region
of
the
southern
hemisphere.
Will
she
ever
come
back?
The
three
eldest
of
the
family
are
all
boys
Matthew,
Mark,
and
Martin.
They
are
seated
together
in
that
corner,
engaged
in
some
game.
Observe
their
three
heads:
much
alike
at
a
first
glance;
at
a
second,
different;
at
a
third,
contrasted.
Dark
haired,
dark
eyed,
red
cheeked
are
the
whole
