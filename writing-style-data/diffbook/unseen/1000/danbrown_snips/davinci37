with
the
brand
name,
but
he
was
glad
to
hear
the
prophylactic
manufacturers
had
gotten
their
hieroglyphs
right.
"Well
done.
Amon
is
indeed
represented
as
a
man
with
a
ram's
head,
and
his
promiscuity
and
curved
horns
are
related
to
our
modern
sexual
slang
'horny.'
"No
shit!"
"No
shit,"
Langdon
said.
"And
do
you
know
who
Amon's
counterpart
was?
The
Egyptian
goddess
of
fertility?"
The
question
met
with
several
seconds
of
silence.
"It
was
Isis,"
Langdon
told
them,
grabbing
a
grease
pen.
"So
we
have
the
male
god,
Amon."
He
wrote
it
down.
"And
the
female
goddess,
Isis,
whose
ancient
pictogram
was
once
called
L'ISA."
Langdon
finished
writing
and
stepped
back
from
the
projector.
AMON
L'ISA
"Ring
any
bells?"
he
asked.
"Mona
Lisa
holy
crap,"
somebody
gasped.
Langdon
nodded.
"Gentlemen,
not
only
does
the
face
of
Mona
Lisa
look
androgynous,
but
her
name
is
an
anagram
of
the
divine
union
of
male
and
female.
And
that,
my
friends,
is
Da
Vinci's
little
secret,
and
the
reason
for
Mona
Lisa's
knowing
smile."
"My
grandfather
was
here,"
Sophie
said,
dropping
suddenly
to
her
knees,
now
only
ten
feet
from
the
Mona
Lisa.
She
pointed
the
black
light
tentatively
to
a
spot
on
the
parquet
floor.
At
first
Langdon
saw
nothing.
Then,
as
he
knelt
beside
her,
he
saw
a
tiny
droplet
of
dried
liquid
that
was
luminescing.
Ink?
Suddenly
he
recalled
what
black
lights
were
actually
used
for.
Blood.
His
senses
tingled.
Sophie
was
right.
Jacques
Sauniere
had
indeed
paid
a
visit
to
the
Mona
Lisa
before
he
died.
"He
wouldn't
have
come
here
without
a
reason,"
Sophie
whispered,
standing
up.
"I
know
he
left
a
message
for
me
here."
Quickly
striding
the
final
few
steps
to
the
Mona
Lisa,
she
illuminated
the
floor
directly
in
front
of
the
painting.
She
waved
the
light
back
and
forth
across
the
bare
parquet.
"There's
nothing
here!"
At
that
moment,
Langdon
saw
a
faint
purple
glimmer
on
the
protective
glass
before
the
Mona
Lisa.
Reaching
down,
he
took
Sophie's
wrist
and
slowly
moved
the
light
up
to
the
painting
itself.
They
both
froze.
On
the
glass,
six
words
glowed
in
purple,
scrawled
directly
across
the
Mona
Lisa's
face.
Seated
at
Sauniere's
desk,
Lieutenant
Collet
pressed
the
phone
to
his
ear
in
disbelief.
Did
I
hear
Fache
correctly?
"A
bar
of
soap?
But
how
could
Langdon
have
known
about
the
GPS
dot?"
"Sophie
Neveu,"
Fache
replied.
"She
told
him."
"What!
Why?"
"Damned
good
question,
but
I
just
heard
a
recording
that
confirms
she
tipped
him
off."
Collet
was
speechless.
What
was
Neveu
thinking?
Fache
had
proof
that
Sophie
had
interfered
with
a
DCPJ
sting
operation?
Sophie
Neveu
was
not
only
going
to
be
fired,
she
was
also
going
to
jail.
"But,
Captain
then
where
is
Langdon
now?"
"Have
any
fire
alarms
gone
off
there?"
"No,
sir."
"And
no
one
has
come
out
under
the
Grand
Gallery
gate?"
"No.
We've
got
a
Louvre
security
officer
on
the
gate.
Just
as
you
requested."
"Okay,
Langdon
must
still
be
inside
the
Grand
Gallery."
"Inside?
But
what
is
he
doing?"
"Is
the
Louvre
security
guard
armed?"
"Yes,
sir.
He's
a
senior
warden."
"Send
him
in,"
Fache
commanded.
"I
can't
get
my
men
back
to
the
perimeter
for
a
few
minutes,
and
I
don't
want
Langdon
breaking
for
an
exit."
Fache
paused.
"And
you'd
better
tell
the
guard
Agent
Neveu
is
probably
in
there
with
him."
"Agent
Neveu
left,
I
thought."
"Did
you
actually
see
her
leave?"
"No,
sir,
but"
"Well,
nobody
on
the
perimeter
saw
her
leave
either.
They
only
saw
her
go
in."
Collet
was
flabbergasted
by
Sophie
Neveu's
bravado.
She's
still
inside
the
building?
"Handle
it,"
Fache
ordered.
"I
want
Langdon
and
Neveu
at
gunpoint
by
the
time
I
get
back."
As
the
Trailor
truck
drove
off,
Captain
Fache
rounded
up
his
men.
Robert
Langdon
had
proven
an
elusive
quarry
tonight,
and
with
Agent
Neveu
now
helping
him,
he
might
be
far
harder
to
corner
than
expected.
Fache
decided
not
to
take
any
chances.
Hedging
his
bets,
he
ordered
half
of
his
men
back
to
the
Louvre
perimeter.
The
other
half
he
sent
to
guard
the
only
location
in
Paris
where
Robert
Langdon
could
find
safe
harbor.
Inside
the
Salle
des
Etats,
Langdon
stared
in
astonishment
at
the
six
words
glowing
on
the
Plexiglas.
The
text
seemed
to
hover
in
space,
casting
a
jagged
shadow
across
Mona
Lisa's
mysterious
smile.
"The
Priory,"
Langdon
whispered.
"This
proves
your
grandfather
was
a
member!"
Sophie
looked
at
him
in
confusion.
"You
understand
this?"
"It's
flawless,"
Langdon
said,
nodding
as
his
thoughts
churned.
"It's
a
proclamation
of
one
of
the
Priory's
most
fundamental
philosophies!"
Sophie
looked
baffled
in
the
glow
of
the
message
scrawled
across
the
Mona
Lisa's
face.
SO
DARK
THE
CON
OF
MAN
"Sophie,"
Langdon
said,
"the
Priory's
tradition
of
perpetuating
goddess
worship
is
based
on
a
belief
that
powerful
men
in
the
early
Christian
church
'conned'
the
world
by
propagating
lies
that
devalued
the
female
and
tipped
the
scales
in
favor
of
the
masculine."
Sophie
remained
silent,
staring
at
the
words.
"The
Priory
believes
that
Constantine
and
his
male
successors
successfully
converted
the
world
from
matriarchal
paganism
to
patriarchal
Christianity
by
waging
a
campaign
of
propaganda
that
demonized
the
sacred
feminine,
obliterating
the
goddess
from
modern
religion
forever."
Sophie's
expression
remained
uncertain.
"My
grandfather
sent
me
to
this
spot
to
find
this.
He
must
be
trying
to
tell
me
more
than
that.
Langdon
understood
her
meaning.
She
thinks
this
is
another
code.
Whether
a
hidden
meaning
existed
here
or
not,
Langdon
could
not
immediately
say.
His
mind
was
still
grappling
with
the
bold
clarity
of
Sauniere's
outward
message.
So
dark
the
con
of
man,
he
thought.
So
dark
indeed.
Nobody
could
deny
the
enormous
good
the
modern
Church
did
in
today's
troubled
world,
and
yet
the
Church
had
a
deceitful
and
violent
history.
Their
brutal
crusade
to
"reeducate"
the
pagan
and
feminine
worshipping
religions
spanned
three
centuries,
employing
methods
as
inspired
as
they
were
horrific.
