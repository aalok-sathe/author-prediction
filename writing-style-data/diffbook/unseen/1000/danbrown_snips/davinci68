than
my
grandfather?"
"I
meant
more
than
anyone
outside
the
brotherhood."
"How
do
you
know
Teabing
isn't
a
member
of
the
brotherhood?"
"Teabing
has
spent
his
life
trying
to
broadcast
the
truth
about
the
Holy
Grail.
The
Priory's
oath
is
to
keep
its
true
nature
hidden.
"Sounds
to
me
like
a
conflict
of
interest."
Langdon
understood
her
concerns.
Sauniere
had
given
the
cryptex
directly
to
Sophie,
and
although
she
didn't
know
what
it
contained
or
what
she
was
supposed
to
do
with
it,
she
was
hesitant
to
involve
a
total
stranger.
Considering
the
information
potentially
enclosed,
the
instinct
was
probably
a
good
one.
"We
don't
need
to
tell
Teabing
about
the
keystone
immediately.
Or
at
all,
even.
His
house
will
give
us
a
place
to
hide
and
think,
and
maybe
when
we
talk
to
him
about
the
Grail,
you'll
start
to
have
an
idea
why
your
grandfather
gave
this
to
you.
"Us,
"
Sophie
reminded.
Langdon
felt
a
humble
pride
and
wondered
yet
again
why
Sauniere
had
included
him.
"Do
you
know
more
or
less
where
Mr.
Teabing
lives?"
Sophie
asked.
"His
estate
is
called
Chateau
Villette."
Sophie
turned
with
an
incredulous
look.
"The
Chateau
Villette?"
"That's
the
one."
"Nice
friends."
"You
know
the
estate?"
"I've
passed
it.
It's
in
the
castle
district.
Twenty
minutes
from
here."
Langdon
frowned.
"That
far?"
"Yes,
which
will
give
you
enough
time
to
tell
me
what
the
Holy
Grail
really
is."
Langdon
paused.
"I'll
tell
you
at
Teabing's.
He
and
I
specialize
in
different
areas
of
the
legend,
so
between
the
two
of
us,
you'll
get
the
full
story."
Langdon
smiled.
"Besides,
the
Grail
has
been
Teabing's
life,
and
hearing
the
story
of
the
Holy
Grail
from
Leigh
Teabing
will
be
like
hearing
the
theory
of
relativity
from
Einstein
himself."
"Let's
hope
Leigh
doesn't
mind
late
night
visitors."
"For
the
record,
it's
Sir
Leigh."
Langdon
had
made
that
mistake
only
once.
"Teabing
is
quite
a
character.
He
was
knighted
by
the
Queen
several
years
back
after
composing
an
extensive
history
on
the
House
of
York."
Sophie
looked
over.
"You're
kidding,
right?
We're
going
to
visit
a
knight?"
Langdon
gave
an
awkward
smile.
"We're
on
a
Grail
quest,
Sophie.
Who
better
to
help
us
than
a
knight?"
The
Sprawling
185
acre
estate
of
Chateau
Villette
was
located
twenty
five
minutes
northwest
of
Paris
in
the
environs
of
Versailles.
Designed
by
Francois
Mansart
in
1668
for
the
Count
of
Aufflay,
it
was
one
of
Paris's
most
significant
historical
chateaux.
Complete
with
two
rectangular
lakes
and
gardens
designed
by
Le
Notre,
Chateau
Villette
was
more
of
a
modest
castle
than
a
mansion.
The
estate
fondly
had
become
known
as
la
Petite
Versailles.
Langdon
brought
the
armored
truck
to
a
shuddering
stop
at
the
foot
of
the
mile
long
driveway.
Beyond
the
imposing
security
gate,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing's
residence
rose
on
a
meadow
in
the
distance.
The
sign
on
the
gate
was
in
English:
PRIVATE
PROPERTY.
NO
TRESPASSING.
As
if
to
proclaim
his
home
a
British
Isle
unto
itself,
Teabing
had
not
only
posted
his
signs
in
English,
but
he
had
installed
his
gate's
intercom
entry
system
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
truck
the
passenger's
side
everywhere
in
Europe
except
England.
Sophie
gave
the
misplaced
intercom
an
odd
look.
"And
if
someone
arrives
without
a
passenger?"
"Don't
ask."
Langdon
had
already
been
through
that
with
Teabing.
"He
prefers
things
the
way
they
are
at
home."
Sophie
rolled
down
her
window.
"Robert,
you'd
better
do
the
talking."
Langdon
shifted
his
position,
leaning
out
across
Sophie
to
press
the
intercom
button.
As
he
did,
an
alluring
whiff
of
Sophie's
perfume
filled
his
nostrils,
and
he
realized
how
close
they
were.
He
waited
there,
awkwardly
prone,
while
a
telephone
began
ringing
over
the
small
speaker.
Finally,
the
intercom
crackled
and
an
irritated
French
accent
spoke.
"Chateau
Villette.
Who
is
calling?"
"This
is
Robert
Langdon,"
Langdon
called
out,
sprawled
across
Sophie's
lap.
"I'm
a
friend
of
Sir
Leigh
Teabing.
I
need
his
help."
"My
master
is
sleeping.
As
was
I.
What
is
your
business
with
him?"
"It
is
a
private
matter.
One
of
great
interest
to
him."
"Then
I'm
sure
he
will
be
pleased
to
receive
you
in
the
morning."
Langdon
shifted
his
weight.
"It's
quite
important."
"As
is
Sir
Leigh's
sleep.
If
you
are
a
friend,
then
you
are
aware
he
is
in
poor
health."
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
had
suffered
from
polio
as
a
child
and
now
wore
leg
braces
and
walked
with
crutches,
but
Langdon
had
found
him
such
a
lively
and
colorful
man
on
his
last
visit
that
it
hardly
seemed
an
infirmity.
"If
you
would,
please
tell
him
I
have
uncovered
new
information
about
the
Grail.
Information
that
cannot
wait
until
morning."
There
was
a
long
pause.
Langdon
and
Sophie
waited,
the
truck
idling
loudly.
A
full
minute
passed.
Finally,
someone
spoke.
"My
good
man,
I
daresay
you
are
still
on
Harvard
Standard
Time."
The
voice
was
crisp
and
light.
Langdon
grinned,
recognizing
the
thick
British
accent.
"Leigh,
my
apologies
for
waking
you
at
this
obscene
hour."
"My
manservant
tells
me
that
not
only
are
you
in
Paris,
but
you
speak
of
the
Grail."
"I
thought
that
might
get
you
out
of
bed."
"And
so
it
has."
"Any
chance
you'd
open
the
gate
for
an
old
friend?"
"Those
who
seek
the
truth
are
more
than
friends.
They
are
brothers."
Langdon
rolled
his
eyes
at
Sophie,
well
accustomed
to
Teabing's
predilection
for
dramatic
antics.
"Indeed
I
will
open
the
gate,"
Teabing
proclaimed,
"but
first
I
must
confirm
your
heart
is
true.
A
test
of
your
honor.
You
will
answer
three
questions."
Langdon
groaned,
whispering
at
Sophie.
"Bear
with
me
here.
As
I
mentioned,
he's
something
of
a
character."
"Your
first
question,"
Teabing
declared,
his
tone
Herculean.
"Shall
I
serve
you
coffee,
or
tea?"
Langdon
knew
Teabing's
feelings
about
the
American
phenomenon
of
coffee.
"Tea,"
he
replied.
"Earl
Grey."
"Excellent.
Your
second
question.
Milk
or
sugar?"
Langdon
hesitated.
"Milk,
"
Sophie
whispered
in
his
ear.
"I
think
the
