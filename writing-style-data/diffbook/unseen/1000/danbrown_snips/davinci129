privately
with
Langdon
could
mean
only
one
thing.
Langdon'
s
mysterious
manuscript
has
touched
a
nerve
with
the
Priory.
Langdon
has
stumbled
onto
a
truth,
and
Sauniere
fears
its
release.
Teabing
felt
certain
the
Grand
Master
was
summoning
Langdon
to
silence
him.
The
Truth
has
been
silenced
long
enough!
Teabing
knew
he
had
to
act
quickly.
Silas's
attack
would
accomplish
two
goals.
It
would
prevent
Sauniere
from
persuading
Langdon
to
keep
quiet,
and
it
would
ensure
that
once
the
keystone
was
in
Teabing's
hands,
Langdon
would
be
in
Paris
for
recruitment
should
Teabing
need
him.
Arranging
the
fatal
meeting
between
Sauniere
and
Silas
had
been
almost
too
easy.
had
inside
information
about
Sauniere
's
deepest
fears.
Yesterday
afternoon,
Silas
had
phoned
the
curator
and
posed
as
a
distraught
priest.
"Monsieur
Sauniere,
forgive
me,
I
must
speak
to
you
at
once.
I
should
never
breach
the
sanctity
of
the
confessional,
but
in
this
case,
I
feel
I
must.
I
just
took
confession
from
a
man
who
claimed
to
have
murdered
members
of
your
family.
Sauniere's
response
was
startled
but
wary.
"My
family
died
in
an
accident.
The
police
report
was
conclusive."
"Yes,
a
car
accident,"
Silas
said,
baiting
the
hook.
"The
man
I
spoke
to
said
he
forced
their
car
off
the
road
into
a
river.
Sauniere
fell
silent.
"Monsieur
Sauniere,
I
would
never
have
phoned
you
directly
except
this
man
made
a
comment
which
makes
me
now
fear
for
your
safety."
He
paused.
"The
man
also
mentioned
your
granddaughter,
Sophie."
The
mention
of
Sophie's
name
had
been
the
catalyst.
The
curator
leapt
into
action.
He
ordered
Silas
to
come
see
him
immediately
in
the
safest
location
Sauniere
knew
his
Louvre
office.
Then
he
phoned
Sophie
to
warn
her
she
might
be
in
danger.
Drinks
with
Robert
Langdon
were
instantly
abandoned.
Now,
with
Langdon
separated
from
Sophie
on
the
far
side
of
the
room,
Teabing
sensed
he
had
successfully
alienated
the
two
companions
from
one
another.
Sophie
Neveu
remained
defiant,
but
Langdon
clearly
saw
the
larger
picture.
He
was
trying
to
figure
out
the
password.
He
understands
the
importance
of
finding
the
Grail
and
releasing
her
from
bondage.
"He
won't
open
it
for
you,"
Sophie
said
coldly.
"Even
if
he
can."
Teabing
was
glancing
at
Langdon
as
he
held
the
gun
on
Sophie.
He
was
fairly
certain
now
he
was
going
to
have
to
use
the
weapon.
Although
the
idea
troubled
him,
he
knew
he
would
not
hesitate
if
it
came
to
that.
have
given
her
every
opportunity
to
do
the
right
thing.
The
Grail
is
bigger
than
any
one
of
us.
At
that
moment,
Langdon
turned
from
the
window.
"The
tomb"
he
said
suddenly,
facing
them
with
a
faint
glimmer
of
hope
in
his
eyes.
"I
know
where
to
look
on
Newton's
tomb.
Yes,
I
think
I
can
find
the
password!"
Teabing's
heart
soared.
"Where,
Robert?
Tell
me!"
Sophie
sounded
horrified.
"Robert,
no!
You're
not
going
to
help
him,
are
you?"
Langdon
approached
with
a
resolute
stride,
holding
the
cryptex
before
him.
"No,"
he
said,
his
eyes
hardening
as
he
turned
to
Leigh.
"Not
until
he
lets
you
go."
Teabing's
optimism
darkened.
"We
are
so
close,
Robert.
Don't
you
dare
start
playing
games
with
me!"
"No
games,"
Langdon
said.
"Let
her
go.
Then
I'll
take
you
to
Newton's
tomb.
We'll
open
the
cryptex
together."
"I'm
not
going
anywhere,"
Sophie
declared,
her
eyes
narrowing
with
rage.
"That
cryptex
was
given
to
me
by
my
grandfather.
It
is
not
yours
to
open."
Langdon
wheeled,
looking
fearful.
"Sophie,
please!
You're
in
danger.
I'm
trying
to
help
you!"
"How?
By
unveiling
the
secret
my
grandfather
died
trying
to
protect?
He
trusted
you,
Robert.
trusted
you!"
Langdon's
blue
eyes
showed
panic
now,
and
Teabing
could
not
help
but
smile
to
see
the
two
of
them
working
against
one
another.
Langdon's
attempts
to
be
gallant
were
more
pathetic
than
anything.
On
the
verge
of
unveiling
one
of
history's
greatest
secrets,
and
he
troubles
himself
with
a
woman
who
has
proven
herself
unworthy
of
the
quest.
"Sophie,"
Langdon
pleaded.
"Please
you
must
leave."
She
shook
her
head.
"Not
unless
you
either
hand
me
the
cryptex
or
smash
it
on
the
floor."
"What?"
Langdon
gasped.
"Robert,
my
grandfather
would
prefer
his
secret
lost
forever
than
see
it
in
the
hands
of
his
murderer."
Sophie's
eyes
looked
as
if
they
would
well
with
tears,
but
they
did
not.
She
stared
directly
back
at
Teabing.
"Shoot
me
if
you
have
to.
I
am
not
leaving
my
grandfather's
legacy
in
your
hands."
Very
well.
Teabing
aimed
the
weapon.
"No!"
Langdon
shouted,
raising
his
arm
and
suspending
the
cryptex
precariously
over
the
hard
stone
floor.
"Leigh,
if
you
even
think
about
it,
I
will
drop
this."
Teabing
laughed.
"That
bluff
worked
on
Remy.
Not
on
me.
I
know
you
better
than
that."
"Do
you,
Leigh?"
Yes
I
do.
Your
poker
face
needs
work,
my
friend.
It
took
me
several
seconds,
but
I
can
see
now
that
you
are
lying.
You
have
no
idea
where
on
Newton
's
tomb
the
answer
lies.
"Truly,
Robert?
You
know
where
on
the
tomb
to
look?"
"Ida"
The
falter
in
Langdon's
eyes
was
fleeting
but
Leigh
caught
it.
There
was
a
lie
there.
A
desperate,
pathetic
ploy
to
save
Sophie.
Teabing
felt
a
profound
disappointment
in
Robert
Langdon.
am
a
lone
knight,
surrounded
by
unworthy
souls.
And
I
will
have
to
decipher
the
keystone
on
my
own.
Langdon
and
Neveu
were
nothing
but
a
threat
to
Teabing
now
and
to
the
Grail.
As
painful
as
the
solution
was
going
to
be,
he
knew
he
could
carry
it
out
with
a
clean
conscience.
The
only
challenge
would
be
to
persuade
Langdon
to
set
down
the
keystone
so
Teabing
could
safely
end
this
charade.
"A
show
of
faith,"
Teabing
said,
lowering
the
gun
from
Sophie.
"Set
down
the
keystone,
and
we'll
talk."
Langdon
knew
his
lie
had
failed.
He
could
see
the
dark
resolve
in
Teabing's
face
and
knew
the
moment
was
upon
them.
When
I
set
this
down,
