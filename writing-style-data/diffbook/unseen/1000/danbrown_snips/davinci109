In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
His
labor's
fruit
a
Holy
wrath
incurred.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
When
Sophie
arrived
at
the
second
group
of
knights,
she
found
that
this
second
group
was
similar
to
the
first.
All
lay
with
varied
body
positions,
wearing
armor
and
swords.
That
was,
all
except
the
tenth
and
final
tomb.
Hurrying
over
to
it,
she
stared
down.
No
pillow.
No
armor.
No
tunic.
No
sword.
"Robert?
Leigh?"
she
called,
her
voice
echoing
around
the
chamber.
"There's
something
missing
over
here."
Both
men
looked
up
and
immediately
began
to
cross
the
room
toward
her.
"An
orb?"
Teabing
called
excitedly.
His
crutches
clicked
out
a
rapid
staccato
as
he
hurried
across
the
room.
"Are
we
missing
an
orb?"
"Not
exactly,"
Sophie
said,
frowning
at
the
tenth
tomb.
"We
seem
to
be
missing
an
entire
knight."
Arriving
beside
her
both
men
gazed
down
in
confusion
at
the
tenth
tomb.
Rather
than
a
knight
lying
in
the
open
air,
this
tomb
was
a
sealed
stone
casket.
The
casket
was
trapezoidal,
tapered
at
the
feet,
widening
toward
the
top,
with
a
peaked
lid.
"Why
isn't
this
knight
shown?"
Langdon
asked.
"Fascinating,"
Teabing
said,
stroking
his
chin.
"I
had
forgotten
about
this
oddity.
It's
been
years
since
I
was
here."
"This
coffin,"
Sophie
said,
"looks
like
it
was
carved
at
the
same
time
and
by
the
same
sculptor
as
the
other
nine
tombs.
So
why
is
this
knight
in
a
casket
rather
than
in
the
open?"
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"One
of
this
church's
mysteries.
To
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
nobody
has
ever
found
any
explanation
for
it.
"Hello?"
the
altar
boy
said,
arriving
with
a
perturbed
look
on
his
face.
"Forgive
me
if
this
seems
rude,
but
you
told
me
you
wanted
to
spread
ashes,
and
yet
you
seem
to
be
sightseeing."
Teabing
scowled
at
the
boy
and
turned
to
Langdon.
"Mr.
Wren,
apparently
your
family's
philanthropy
does
not
buy
you
the
time
it
used
to,
so
perhaps
we
should
take
out
the
ashes
and
get
on
with
it."
Teabing
turned
to
Sophie.
"Mrs.
Wren?"
Sophie
played
along,
pulling
the
vellumwrapped
cryptex
from
her
pocket.
"Now
then,"
Teabing
snapped
at
the
boy,
"if
you
would
give
us
some
privacy?"
The
altar
boy
did
not
move.
He
was
eyeing
Langdon
closely
now.
"You
look
familiar."
Teabing
huffed.
"Perhaps
that
is
because
Mr.
Wren
comes
here
every
year!"
Or
perhaps,
Sophie
now
feared,
because
he
saw
Langdon
on
television
at
the
Vatican
last
year.
"I
have
never
met
Mr.
Wren,"
the
altar
boy
declared.
"You're
mistaken,"
Langdon
said
politely.
"I
believe
you
and
I
met
in
passing
last
year.
Father
Knowles
failed
to
formally
introduce
us,
but
I
recognized
your
face
as
we
came
in.
Now,
I
realize
this
is
an
intrusion,
but
if
you
could
afford
me
a
few
more
minutes,
I
have
traveled
a
great
distance
to
scatter
ashes
amongst
these
tombs."
Langdon
spoke
his
lines
with
Teabing
esque
belie
vability.
The
altar
boy's
expression
turned
even
more
skeptical.
"These
are
not
tombs.
"I'm
sorry?"
Langdon
said.
"Of
course
they
are
tombs,"
Teabing
declared.
"What
are
you
talking
about?"
The
altar
boy
shook
his
head.
"Tombs
contain
bodies.
These
are
effigies.
Stone
tributes
to
real
men.
There
are
no
bodies
beneath
these
figures."
"This
is
a
crypt!"
Teabing
said.
"Only
in
outdated
history
books.
This
was
believed
to
be
a
crypt
but
was
revealed
as
nothing
of
the
sort
during
the
1950
renovation."
He
turned
back
to
Langdon.
"And
I
imagine
Mr.
Wren
would
know
that.
Considering
it
was
his
family
that
uncovered
that
fact.
An
uneasy
silence
fell.
It
was
broken
by
the
sound
of
a
door
slamming
out
in
the
annex.
"That
must
be
Father
Knowles,"
Teabing
said.
"Perhaps
you
should
go
see?"
The
altar
boy
looked
doubtful
but
stalked
back
toward
the
annex,
leaving
Langdon,
Sophie,
and
Teabing
to
eye
one
another
gloomily.
"Leigh,"
Langdon
whispered.
"No
bodies?
What
is
he
talking
about?"
Teabing
looked
distraught.
"I
don't
know.
I
always
thought
certainly,
this
must
be
the
place.
I
can't
imagine
he
knows
what
he
is
talking
about.
It
makes
no
sense
!
"Can
I
see
the
poem
again?"
Langdon
said.
Sophie
pulled
the
cryptex
from
her
pocket
and
carefully
handed
it
to
him.
Langdon
unwrapped
the
vellum,
holding
the
cryptex
in
his
hand
while
he
examined
the
poem.
"Yes,
the
poem
definitely
references
a
tomb.
Not
an
effigy."
"Could
the
poem
be
wrong?"
Teabing
asked.
"Could
Jacques
Sauniere
have
made
the
same
mistake
I
just
did?"
Langdon
considered
it
and
shook
his
head.
"Leigh,
you
said
it
yourself.
This
church
was
built
by
Templars,
the
military
arm
of
the
Priory.
Something
tells
me
the
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
would
have
a
pretty
good
idea
if
there
were
knights
buried
here."
Teabing
looked
flabbergasted.
"But
this
place
is
perfect."
He
wheeled
back
toward
the
knights.
"We
must
be
missing
something!"
Entering
the
annex,
the
altar
boy
was
surprised
to
find
it
deserted.
"Father
Knowles?"
know
I
heard
the
door,
he
thought,
moving
forward
until
he
could
see
the
entryway.
A
thin
man
in
a
tuxedo
stood
near
the
doorway,
scratching
his
head
and
looking
lost.
The
altar
boy
gave
an
irritated
huff,
realizing
he
had
forgotten
to
relock
the
door
when
he
let
the
others
in.
Now
some
pathetic
sod
had
wandered
in
off
the
street,
looking
for
directions
to
some
wedding
from
the
looks
of
it.
"I'm
sorry,"
he
called
out,
passing
a
large
pillar,
"we're
closed."
A
flurry
of
cloth
ruffled
behind
him,
and
before
the
altar
boy
could
turn,
his
head
snapped
backward,
a
powerful
hand
clamping
hard
over
his
mouth
from
behind,
muffling
his
scream.
The
hand
over
the
boy's
mouth
was
snow
white,
and
he
smelled
alcohol.
The
prim
man
in
the
tuxedo
calmly
produced
a
very
small
revolver,
which
he
aimed
directly
at
the
boy's
forehead.
The
altar
boy
felt
his
groin
