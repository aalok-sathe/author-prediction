in
a
well
lit
abbey
had
been
formed
during
the
peak
summer
tourist
season.
Today
was
a
rainy
April
morning.
Rather
than
crowds
and
shimmering
stained
glass,
all
Langdon
saw
was
acres
of
desolate
floor
and
shadowy,
empty
alcoves.
"We
passed
through
metal
detectors,"
Sophie
reminded,
apparently
sensing
Langdon's
apprehension.
"If
anyone
is
in
here,
they
can't
be
armed."
Langdon
nodded
but
still
felt
circumspect.
He
had
wanted
to
bring
the
London
police
with
them,
but
Sophie's
fears
of
who
might
be
involved
put
a
damper
on
any
contact
with
the
authorities.
We
need
to
recover
the
cryptex,
Sophie
had
insisted.
It
is
the
key
to
everything.
She
was
right,
of
course.
The
key
to
getting
Leigh
back
alive.
The
key
to
finding
the
Holy
Grail.
The
key
to
learning
who
is
behind
this.
Unfortunately,
their
only
chance
to
recover
the
keystone
seemed
to
be
here
and
now
at
the
tomb
of
Isaac
Newton.
Whoever
held
the
cryptex
would
have
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
tomb
to
decipher
the
final
clue,
and
if
they
had
not
already
come
and
gone,
Sophie
and
Langdon
intended
to
intercept
them.
Striding
toward
the
left
wall
to
get
out
of
the
open,
they
moved
into
an
obscure
side
aisle
behind
a
row
of
pilasters.
Langdon
couldn't
shake
the
image
of
Leigh
Teabing
being
held
captive,
probably
tied
up
in
the
back
of
his
own
limousine.
Whoever
had
ordered
the
top
Priory
members
killed
would
not
hesitate
to
eliminate
others
who
stood
in
the
way.
It
seemed
a
cruel
irony
that
Teabing
a
modern
British
knight
was
a
hostage
in
the
search
for
his
own
countryman,
Sir
Isaac
Newton.
"Which
way
is
it?"
Sophie
asked,
looking
around.
The
tomb.
Langdon
had
no
idea.
"We
should
find
a
docent
and
ask."
Langdon
knew
better
than
to
wander
aimlessly
in
here.
Westminster
Abbey
was
a
tangled
warren
of
mausoleums,
perimeter
chambers,
and
walk
in
burial
niches.
Like
the
Louvre's
Grand
Gallery,
it
had
a
lone
point
of
entry
the
door
through
which
they
had
just
passed
easy
to
find
your
way
in,
but
impossible
to
find
your
way
out.
A
literal
tourist
trap,
one
of
Langdon's
befuddled
colleagues
had
called
it.
Keeping
architectural
tradition,
the
abbey
was
laid
out
in
the
shape
of
a
giant
crucifix.
Unlike
most
churches,
however,
it
had
its
entrance
on
the
side,
rather
than
the
standard
rear
of
the
church
via
the
narthex
at
the
bottom
of
the
nave.
Moreover,
the
abbey
had
a
series
of
sprawling
cloisters
attached.
One
false
step
through
the
wrong
archway,
and
a
visitor
was
lost
in
a
labyrinth
of
outdoor
passageways
surrounded
by
high
walls.
"Docents
wear
crimson
robes,"
Langdon
said,
approaching
the
center
of
the
church.
Peering
obliquely
across
the
towering
gilded
altar
to
the
far
end
of
the
south
transept,
Langdon
saw
several
people
crawling
on
their
hands
and
knees.
This
prostrate
pilgrimage
was
a
common
occurrence
in
Poets'
Corner,
although
it
was
far
less
holy
than
it
appeared.
Tourists
doing
grave
rubbings.
"I
don't
see
any
docents,"
Sophie
said.
"Maybe
we
can
find
the
tomb
on
our
own?"
Without
a
word,
Langdon
led
her
another
few
steps
to
the
center
of
the
abbey
and
pointed
to
the
right.
Sophie
drew
a
startled
breath
as
she
looked
down
the
length
of
the
abbey's
nave,
the
full
magnitude
of
the
building
now
visible.
"Aah,"
she
said.
"Let's
find
a
docent."
At
that
moment,
a
hundred
yards
down
the
nave,
out
of
sight
behind
the
choir
screen,
the
stately
tomb
of
Sir
Isaac
Newton
had
a
lone
visitor.
The
Teacher
had
been
scrutinizing
the
monument
for
ten
minutes
now.
Newton's
tomb
consisted
of
a
massive
black
marble
sarcophagus
on
which
reclined
the
sculpted
form
of
Sir
Isaac
Newton,
wearing
classical
costume,
and
leaning
proudly
against
a
stack
of
his
own
books
Divinity,
Chronology,
Opticks,
and
Philosophiae
Naturalis
Principia
Mathematica.
At
Newton's
feet
stood
two
winged
boys
holding
a
scroll.
Behind
Newton's
recumbent
body
rose
an
austere
pyramid.
Although
the
pyramid
itself
seemed
an
oddity,
it
was
the
giant
shape
mounted
halfway
up
the
pyramid
that
most
intrigued
the
Teacher.
An
orb.
The
Teacher
pondered
Sauniere's
beguiling
riddle.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
The
massive
orb
protruding
from
the
face
of
the
pyramid
was
carved
in
basso
relievo
and
depicted
all
kinds
of
heavenly
bodies
constellations,
signs
of
the
zodiac,
comets,
stars,
and
planets.
Above
it,
the
image
of
the
Goddess
of
Astronomy
beneath
a
field
of
stars.
Countless
orbs.
The
Teacher
had
been
convinced
that
once
he
found
the
tomb,
discerning
the
missing
orb
would
be
easy.
Now
he
was
not
so
sure.
He
was
gazing
at
a
complicated
map
of
the
heavens.
Was
there
a
missing
planet?
Had
some
astronomical
orb
been
omitted
from
a
constellation?
He
had
no
idea.
Even
so,
the
Teacher
could
not
help
but
suspect
that
the
solution
would
be
ingeniously
clean
and
simple
"a
knight
a
pope
interred."
What
orb
am
I
looking
for?
Certainly,
an
advanced
knowledge
of
astrophysics
was
not
a
prerequisite
for
finding
the
Holy
Grail,
was
it?
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
The
Teacher's
concentration
was
broken
by
several
approaching
tourists.
He
slipped
the
cryptex
back
in
his
pocket
and
watched
warily
as
the
visitors
went
to
a
nearby
table,
left
a
donation
in
the
cup,
and
restocked
on
the
complimentary
grave
rubbing
supplies
set
out
by
the
abbey.
Armed
with
fresh
charcoal
pencils
and
large
sheets
of
heavy
paper,
they
headed
off
toward
the
front
of
the
abbey,
probably
to
the
popular
Poets'
Corner
to
pay
their
respects
to
Chaucer,
Tennyson,
and
Dickens
by
rubbing
furiously
on
their
graves.
Alone
again,
he
stepped
closer
to
the
tomb,
scanning
it
from
bottom
to
top.
He
began
with
the
clawed
feet
beneath
the
sarcophagus,
moved
upward
past
Newton,
past
his
books
on
science,
past
the
two
boys
with
their
mathematical
scroll,
up
the
face
of
the
pyramid
to
the
giant
orb
with
its
constellations,
and
finally
up
to
