yet
what
the
Teacher
was
now
commanding
seemed
impossible.
"But
the
church,
it
is
a
fortress.
Especially
at
night.
How
will
I
enter?"
With
the
confident
tone
of
a
man
of
enormous
influence,
the
Teacher
explained
what
was
to
be
done.
When
Silas
hung
up
the
phone,
his
skin
tingled
with
anticipation.
One
hour,
he
told
himself,
grateful
that
the
Teacher
had
given
him
time
to
carry
out
the
necessary
penance
before
entering
a
house
of
God.
must
purge
my
soul
of
today's
sins.
The
sins
committed
today
had
been
holy
in
purpose.
Acts
of
war
against
the
enemies
of
God
had
been
committed
for
centuries.
Forgiveness
was
assured.
Even
so,
Silas
knew,
absolution
required
sacrifice.
Pulling
his
shades,
he
stripped
naked
and
knelt
in
the
center
of
his
room.
Looking
down,
he
examined
the
spiked
cilice
belt
clamped
around
his
thigh.
All
true
followers
of
The
Way
wore
this
device
a
leather
strap,
studded
with
sharp
metal
barbs
that
cut
into
the
flesh
as
a
perpetual
reminder
of
Christ's
suffering.
The
pain
caused
by
the
device
also
helped
counteract
the
desires
of
the
flesh.
Although
Silas
already
had
worn
his
cilice
today
longer
than
the
requisite
two
hours,
he
knew
today
was
no
ordinary
day.
Grasping
the
buckle,
he
cinched
it
one
notch
tighter,
wincing
as
the
barbs
dug
deeper
into
his
flesh.
Exhaling
slowly,
he
savored
the
cleansing
ritual
of
his
pain.
Pain
is
good,
Silas
whispered,
repeating
the
sacred
mantra
of
Father
Josemaria
Escriva
the
Teacher
of
all
Teachers.
Although
Escriva
had
died
in
1975,
his
wisdom
lived
on,
his
words
still
whispered
by
thousands
of
faithful
servants
around
the
globe
as
they
knelt
on
the
floor
and
performed
the
sacred
practice
known
as
"corporal
mortification."
Silas
turned
his
attention
now
to
a
heavy
knotted
rope
coiled
neatly
on
the
floor
beside
him.
The
Discipline.
The
knots
were
caked
with
dried
blood.
Eager
for
the
purifying
effects
of
his
own
agony,
Silas
said
a
quick
prayer.
Then,
gripping
one
end
of
the
rope,
he
closed
his
eyes
and
swung
it
hard
over
his
shoulder,
feeling
the
knots
slap
against
his
back.
He
whipped
it
over
his
shoulder
again,
slashing
at
his
flesh.
Again
and
again,
he
lashed.
Castigo
corpus
meum.
Finally,
he
felt
the
blood
begin
to
flow.
The
crisp
April
air
whipped
through
the
open
window
of
the
Citroen
ZX
as
it
skimmed
south
past
the
Opera
House
and
crossed
Place
Vendome.
In
the
passenger
seat,
Robert
Langdon
felt
the
city
tear
past
him
as
he
tried
to
clear
his
thoughts.
His
quick
shower
and
shave
had
left
him
looking
reasonably
presentable
but
had
done
little
to
ease
his
anxiety.
The
frightening
image
of
the
curator's
body
remained
locked
in
his
mind.
Jacques
Sauniere
is
dead.
Langdon
could
not
help
but
feel
a
deep
sense
of
loss
at
the
curator's
death.
Despite
Sauniere's
reputation
for
being
reclusive,
his
recognition
for
dedication
to
the
arts
made
him
an
easy
man
to
revere.
His
books
on
the
secret
codes
hidden
in
the
paintings
of
Poussin
and
Teniers
were
some
of
Langdon's
favorite
classroom
texts.
Tonight's
meeting
had
been
one
Langdon
was
very
much
looking
forward
to,
and
he
was
disappointed
when
the
curator
had
not
shown.
Again
the
image
of
the
curator's
body
flashed
in
his
mind.
Jacques
Sauniere
did
that
to
himself?
Langdon
turned
and
looked
out
the
window,
forcing
the
picture
from
his
mind.
Outside,
the
city
was
just
now
winding
down
street
vendors
wheeling
carts
of
candied
amandes,
waiters
carrying
bags
of
garbage
to
the
curb,
a
pair
of
late
night
lovers
cuddling
to
stay
warm
in
a
breeze
scented
with
jasmine
blossom.
The
Citroen
navigated
the
chaos
with
authority,
its
dissonant
two
tone
siren
parting
the
traffic
like
a
knife.
"he
capitaine
was
pleased
to
discover
you
were
still
in
Paris
tonight,"
the
agent
said,
speaking
for
the
first
time
since
they'd
left
the
hotel.
"A
fortunate
coincidence."
Langdon
was
feeling
anything
but
fortunate,
and
coincidence
was
a
concept
he
did
not
entirely
trust.
As
someone
who
had
spent
his
life
exploring
the
hidden
interconnectivity
of
disparate
emblems
and
ideologies,
Langdon
viewed
the
world
as
a
web
of
profoundly
intertwined
histories
and
events.
The
connections
may
be
invisible,
he
often
preached
to
his
symbology
classes
at
Harvard,
but
they
are
always
there,
buried
just
beneath
the
surface.
"I
assume,"
Langdon
said,
"that
the
American
University
of
Paris
told
you
where
I
was
staying?"
The
driver
shook
his
head.
"Interpol."
Interpol,
Langdon
thought.
Of
course.
He
had
forgotten
that
the
seemingly
innocuous
request
of
all
European
hotels
to
see
a
passport
at
check
in
was
more
than
a
quaint
formality
it
was
the
law.
On
any
given
night,
all
across
Europe,
Interpol
officials
could
pinpoint
exactly
who
was
sleeping
where.
Finding
Langdon
at
the
Ritz
had
probably
taken
all
of
five
seconds.
As
the
Citroen
accelerated
southward
across
the
city,
the
illuminated
profile
of
the
Eiffel
Tower
appeared,
shooting
skyward
in
the
distance
to
the
right.
Seeing
it,
Langdon
thought
of
Vittoria,
recalling
their
playful
promise
a
year
ago
that
every
six
months
they
would
meet
again
at
a
different
romantic
spot
on
the
globe.
The
Eiffel
Tower,
Langdon
suspected,
would
have
made
their
list.
Sadly,
he
last
kissed
Vittoria
in
a
noisy
airport
in
Rome
more
than
a
year
ago.
"Did
you
mount
her?"
the
agent
asked,
looking
over.
Langdon
glanced
up,
certain
he
had
misunderstood.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"She
is
lovely,
no?"
The
agent
motioned
through
the
windshield
toward
the
Eiffel
Tower.
"Have
you
mounted
her?"
Langdon
rolled
his
eyes.
"No,
I
haven't
climbed
the
tower."
"She
is
the
symbol
of
France.
I
think
she
is
perfect."
Langdon
nodded
absently.
Symbologists
often
remarked
that
France
a
country
renowned
for
machismo,
womanizing,
and
diminutive
insecure
leaders
like
Napoleon
and
Pepin
the
Short
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
apt
national
emblem
than
a
thousand
foot
phallus.
When
they
reached
the
intersection
at
Rue
de
Rivoli,
the
traffic
light
was
red,
but
the
