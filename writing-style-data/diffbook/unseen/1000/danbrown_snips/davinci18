frightened.
The
young
priest
was
smiling
as
he
entered.
His
nose
was
awkwardly
bandaged,
and
he
was
holding
out
an
old
Bible.
"I
found
one
in
French
for
you.
The
chapter
is
marked."
Uncertain,
the
ghost
took
the
Bible
and
looked
at
the
chapter
the
priest
had
marked.
Acts
16.
The
verses
told
of
a
prisoner
named
Silas
who
lay
naked
and
beaten
in
his
cell,
singing
hymns
to
God.
When
the
ghost
reached
Verse
26,
he
gasped
in
shock.
"
And
suddenly,
there
was
a
great
earthquake,
so
that
the
foundations
of
the
prison
were
shaken,
and
all
the
doors
fell
open.
His
eyes
shot
up
at
the
priest.
The
priest
smiled
warmly.
"From
now
on,
my
friend,
if
you
have
no
other
name,
I
shall
call
you
Silas."
The
ghost
nodded
blankly.
Silas.
He
had
been
given
flesh.
My
name
is
Silas.
"It's
time
for
breakfast,"
the
priest
said.
"You
will
need
your
strength
if
you
are
to
help
me
build
this
church."
Twenty
thousand
feet
above
the
Mediterranean,
Alitalia
flight
1618
bounced
in
turbulence,
causing
passengers
to
shift
nervously.
Bishop
Aringarosa
barely
noticed.
His
thoughts
were
with
the
future
of
Opus
Dei.
Eager
to
know
how
plans
in
Paris
were
progressing,
he
wished
he
could
phone
Silas.
But
he
could
not.
The
Teacher
had
seen
to
that.
"It
is
for
your
own
safety,"
the
Teacher
had
explained,
speaking
in
English
with
a
French
accent.
"I
am
familiar
enough
with
electronic
communications
to
know
they
can
be
intercepted.
The
results
could
be
disastrous
for
you.
Aringarosa
knew
he
was
right.
The
Teacher
seemed
an
exceptionally
careful
man.
He
had
not
revealed
his
own
identity
to
Aringarosa,
and
yet
he
had
proven
himself
a
man
well
worth
obeying.
After
all,
he
had
somehow
obtained
very
secret
information.
The
names
of
the
brotherhood'
s
four
top
members!
This
had
been
one
of
the
coups
that
convinced
the
bishop
the
Teacher
was
truly
capable
of
delivering
the
astonishing
prize
he
claimed
he
could
unearth.
"Bishop,"
the
Teacher
had
told
him,
"I
have
made
all
the
arrangements.
For
my
plan
to
succeed,
you
must
allow
Silas
to
answer
only
to
me
for
several
days.
The
two
of
you
will
not
speak.
I
will
communicate
with
him
through
secure
channels."
"You
will
treat
him
with
respect?"
"A
man
of
faith
deserves
the
highest."
"Excellent.
Then
I
understand.
Silas
and
I
shall
not
speak
until
this
is
over."
"I
do
this
to
protect
your
identity,
Silas's
identity,
and
my
investment."
"Your
investment?"
"Bishop,
if
your
own
eagerness
to
keep
abreast
of
progress
puts
you
in
jail,
then
you
will
be
unable
to
pay
me
my
fee."
The
bishop
smiled.
"A
fine
point.
Our
desires
are
in
accord.
Godspeed."
Twenty
million
euro,
the
bishop
thought,
now
gazing
out
the
plane's
window.
The
sum
was
approximately
the
same
number
of
U.S.
dollars.
A
pittance
for
something
so
powerful.
He
felt
a
renewed
confidence
that
the
Teacher
and
Silas
would
not
fail.
Money
and
faith
were
powerful
motivators.
"Une
plaisanterie
numerique?"
Bezu
Fache
was
livid,
glaring
at
Sophie
Neveu
in
disbelief.
A
numeric
joke?
"Your
professional
assessment
of
Sauniere's
code
is
that
it
is
some
kind
of
mathematical
prank?"
Fache
was
in
utter
incomprehension
of
this
woman's
gall.
Not
only
had
she
just
barged
in
on
Fache
without
permission,
but
she
was
now
trying
to
convince
him
that
Sauniere,
in
his
final
moments
of
life,
had
been
inspired
to
leave
a
mathematical
gag?
"This
code,"
Sophie
explained
in
rapid
French,
"is
simplistic
to
the
point
of
absurdity.
Jacques
Sauniere
must
have
known
we
would
see
through
it
immediately."
She
pulled
a
scrap
of
paper
from
her
sweater
pocket
and
handed
it
to
Fache.
"Here
is
the
decryption."
Fache
looked
at
the
card.

"This
is
it?"
he
snapped.
"All
you
did
was
put
the
numbers
in
increasing
order!"
Sophie
actually
had
the
nerve
to
give
a
satisfied
smile.
"Exactly."
Fache's
tone
lowered
to
a
guttural
rumble.
"Agent
Neveu,
I
have
no
idea
where
the
hell
you're
going
with
this,
but
I
suggest
you
get
there
fast."
He
shot
an
anxious
glance
at
Langdon,
who
stood
nearby
with
the
phone
pressed
to
his
ear,
apparently
still
listening
to
his
phone
message
from
the
U.S.
Embassy.
From
Langdon's
ashen
expression,
Fache
sensed
the
news
was
bad.
"Captain,"
Sophie
said,
her
tone
dangerously
defiant,
"the
sequence
of
numbers
you
have
in
your
hand
happens
to
be
one
of
the
most
famous
mathematical
progressions
in
history."
Fache
was
not
aware
there
even
existed
a
mathematical
progression
that
qualified
as
famous,
and
he
certainly
didn't
appreciate
Sophie's
off
handed
tone.
"This
is
the
Fibonacci
sequence,"
she
declared,
nodding
toward
the
piece
of
paper
in
Fache's
hand.
"A
progression
in
which
each
term
is
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
two
preceding
terms."
Fache
studied
the
numbers.
Each
term
was
indeed
the
sum
of
the
two
previous,
and
yet
Fache
could
not
imagine
what
the
relevance
of
all
this
was
to
Sauniere's
death.
"Mathematician
Leonardo
Fibonacci
created
this
succession
of
numbers
in
the
thirteenth
century.
Obviously
there
can
be
no
coincidence
that
all
of
the
numbers
Sauniere
wrote
on
the
floor
belong
to
Fibonacci's
famous
sequence."
Fache
stared
at
the
young
woman
for
several
moments.
"Fine,
if
there
is
no
coincidence,
would
you
tell
me
why
Jacques
Sauniere
chose
to
do
this.
What
is
he
saying?
What
does
this
mean?"
She
shrugged.
"Absolutely
nothing.
That's
the
point.
It's
a
simplistic
cryptographic
joke.
Like
taking
the
words
of
a
famous
poem
and
shuffling
them
at
random
to
see
if
anyone
recognizes
what
all
the
words
have
in
common."
Fache
took
a
menacing
step
forward,
placing
his
face
only
inches
from
Sophie's.
"I
certainly
hope
you
have
a
much
more
satisfying
explanation
than
that.
Sophie's
soft
features
grew
surprisingly
stern
as
she
leaned
in.
"Captain,
considering
what
you
have
at
stake
here
tonight,
I
thought
you
might
appreciate
knowing
that
Jacques
Sauniere
might
be
playing
games
with
you.
