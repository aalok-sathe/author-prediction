I
expect
you
will
join
me
there
permanently.
I'm
planning
to
buy
a
splendid
villa
in
Devonshire,
and
we'll
have
all
your
things
shipped
up
immediately.
An
adventure,
Remy.
I
say,
an
adventure!"
Langdon
had
to
smile.
As
Teabing
railed
on
about
his
plans
for
a
triumphant
return
to
Britain,
Langdon
felt
himself
caught
up
in
the
man's
infectious
enthusiasm.
Gazing
absently
out
the
window,
Langdon
watched
the
woods
passing
by,
ghostly
pale
in
the
yellow
blush
of
the
fog
lights.
The
side
mirror
was
tipped
inward,
brushed
askew
by
branches,
and
Langdon
saw
the
reflection
of
Sophie
sitting
quietly
in
the
back
seat.
He
watched
her
for
a
long
while
and
felt
an
unexpected
upwelling
of
contentment.
Despite
his
troubles
tonight,
Langdon
was
thankful
to
have
landed
in
such
good
company.
After
several
minutes,
as
if
suddenly
sensing
his
eyes
on
her,
Sophie
leaned
forward
and
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders,
giving
him
a
quick
rub.
"You
okay?"
"Yeah,"
Langdon
said.
"Somehow."
Sophie
sat
back
in
her
seat,
and
Langdon
saw
a
quiet
smile
cross
her
lips.
He
realized
that
he
too
was
now
grinning.
Wedged
in
the
back
of
the
Range
Rover,
Silas
could
barely
breathe.
His
arms
were
wrenched
backward
and
heavily
lashed
to
his
ankles
with
kitchen
twine
and
duct
tape.
Every
bump
in
the
road
sent
pain
shooting
through
his
twisted
shoulders.
At
least
his
captors
had
removed
the
cilice.
Unable
to
inhale
through
the
strip
of
tape
over
his
mouth,
he
could
only
breathe
through
his
nostrils,
which
were
slowly
clogging
up
due
to
the
dusty
rear
cargo
area
into
which
he
had
been
crammed.
He
began
coughing.
"I
think
he's
choking,"
the
French
driver
said,
sounding
concerned.
The
British
man
who
had
struck
Silas
with
his
crutch
now
turned
and
peered
over
the
seat,
frowning
coldly
at
Silas.
"Fortunately
for
you,
we
British
judge
man's
civility
not
by
his
compassion
for
his
friends,
but
by
his
compassion
for
his
enemies."
The
Brit
reached
down
and
grabbed
the
duct
tape
on
Silas's
mouth.
In
one
fast
motion,
he
tore
it
off.
Silas
felt
as
if
his
lips
had
just
caught
fire,
but
the
air
pouring
into
his
lungs
was
sent
from
God.
"Whom
do
you
work
for?"
the
British
man
demanded.
"I
do
the
work
of
God,"
Silas
spat
back
through
the
pain
in
his
jaw
where
the
woman
had
kicked
him.
"You
belong
to
Opus
Dei,"
the
man
said.
It
was
not
a
question.
"You
know
nothing
of
who
I
am."
"Why
does
Opus
Dei
want
the
keystone?"
Silas
had
no
intention
of
answering.
The
keystone
was
the
link
to
the
Holy
Grail,
and
the
Holy
Grail
was
the
key
to
protecting
the
faith.
do
the
work
of
God.
The
Way
is
in
peril.
Now,
in
the
Range
Rover,
struggling
against
his
bonds,
Silas
feared
he
had
failed
the
Teacher
and
the
bishop
forever.
He
had
no
way
even
to
contact
them
and
tell
them
the
terrible
turn
of
events.
My
captors
have
the
keystone!
They
will
reach
the
Grail
before
we
do!
In
the
stifling
darkness,
Silas
prayed.
He
let
the
pain
of
his
body
fuel
his
supplications.
A
miracle,
Lord.
I
need
a
miracle.
Silas
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
hours
from
now,
he
would
get
one.
"Robert?"
Sophie
was
still
watching
him.
"A
funny
look
just
crossed
your
face."
Langdon
glanced
back
at
her,
realizing
his
jaw
was
firmly
set
and
his
heart
was
racing.
An
incredible
notion
had
just
occurred
to
him.
Could
it
really
be
that
simple
an
explanation?
"I
need
to
use
your
cell
phone,
Sophie."
"Now?"
"I
think
I
just
figured
something
out."
"What?"
"I'll
tell
you
in
a
minute.
I
need
your
phone."
Sophie
looked
wary.
"I
doubt
Fache
is
tracing,
but
keep
it
under
a
minute
just
in
case."
She
gave
him
her
phone.
"How
do
I
dial
the
States?"
"You
need
to
reverse
the
charges.
My
service
doesn't
cover
transatlantic."
Langdon
dialed
zero,
knowing
that
the
next
sixty
seconds
might
answer
a
question
that
had
been
puzzling
him
all
night.
New
York
editor
Jonas
Faukman
had
just
climbed
into
bed
for
the
night
when
the
telephone
rang.
A
little
late
for
callers,
he
grumbled,
picking
up
the
receiver.
An
operator's
voice
asked
him,
"Will
you
accept
charges
for
a
collect
call
from
Robert
Langdon?"
Puzzled,
Jonas
turned
on
the
light.
"Uh
sure,
okay."
The
line
clicked.
"Jonas?"
"Robert?
You
wake
me
up
and
you
charge
me
for
it?"
"Jonas,
forgive
me,"
Langdon
said.
"I'll
keep
this
very
short.
I
really
need
to
know.
The
manuscript
I
gave
you.
Have
you
"Robert,
I'm
sorry,
I
know
I
said
I'd
send
the
edits
out
to
you
this
week,
but
I'm
swamped.
Next
Monday.
I
promise."
"I'm
not
worried
about
the
edits.
I
need
to
know
if
you
sent
any
copies
out
for
blurbs
without
telling
me?"
Faukman
hesitated.
Langdon's
newest
manuscript
an
exploration
of
the
history
of
goddess
worship
included
several
sections
about
Mary
Magdalene
that
were
going
to
raise
some
eyebrows.
Although
the
material
was
well
documented
and
had
been
covered
by
others,
Faukman
had
no
intention
of
printing
Advance
Reading
Copies
of
Langdon's
book
without
at
least
a
few
endorsements
from
serious
historians
and
art
luminaries.
Jonas
had
chosen
ten
big
names
in
the
art
world
and
sent
them
all
sections
of
the
manuscript
along
with
a
polite
letter
asking
if
they
would
be
willing
to
write
a
short
endorsement
for
the
jacket.
In
Faukman's
experience,
most
people
jumped
at
the
opportunity
to
see
their
name
in
print.
"Jonas?"
Langdon
pressed.
"You
sent
out
my
manuscript,
didn't
you?"
Faukman
frowned,
sensing
Langdon
was
not
happy
about
it.
"The
manuscript
was
clean,
Robert,
and
I
wanted
to
surprise
you
with
some
terrific
blurbs."
A
pause.
"Did
you
send
one
to
the
curator
of
the
Paris
Louvre?"
"What
do
you
think?
Your
manuscript
referenced
his
Louvre
collection
several
times,
his
books
are
in
your
bibliography,
and
the

some

clout
