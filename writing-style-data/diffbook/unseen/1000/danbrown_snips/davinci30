Lisa!
The
Mona
Lisa.
For
an
instant,
standing
in
the
exit
stairwell,
Sophie
forgot
all
about
trying
to
leave
the
Louvre.
Her
shock
over
the
anagram
was
matched
only
by
her
embarrassment
at
not
having
deciphered
the
message
herself.
Sophie's
expertise
in
complex
cryptanalysis
had
caused
her
to
overlook
simplistic
word
games,
and
yet
she
knew
she
should
have
seen
it.
After
all,
she
was
no
stranger
to
anagrams
especially
in
English.
When
she
was
young,
often
her
grandfather
would
use
anagram
games
to
hone
her
English
spelling.
Once
he
had
written
the
English
word
"planets"
and
told
Sophie
that
an
astonishing
sixty
two
other
English
words
of
varying
lengths
could
be
formed
using
those
same
letters.
Sophie
had
spent
three
days
with
an
English
dictionary
until
she
found
them
all.
"I
can't
imagine,"
Langdon
said,
staring
at
the
printout,
"how
your
grandfather
created
such
an
intricate
anagram
in
the
minutes
before
he
died."
Sophie
knew
the
explanation,
and
the
realization
made
her
feel
even
worse.
should
have
seen
this!
She
now
recalled
that
her
grandfather
a
wordplay
aficionado
and
art
lover
had
entertained
himself
as
a
young
man
by
creating
anagrams
of
famous
works
of
art.
In
fact,
one
of
his
anagrams
had
gotten
him
in
trouble
once
when
Sophie
was
a
little
girl.
While
being
interviewed
by
an
American
art
magazine,
Sauniere
had
expressed
his
distaste
for
the
modernist
Cubist
movement
by
noting
that
Picasso's
masterpiece
Les
Demoiselles
d
'Avignon
was
a
perfect
anagram
of
vile
meaningless
doodles.
Picasso
fans
were
not
amused.
"My
grandfather
probably
created
this
Mona
Lisa
anagram
long
ago,"
Sophie
said,
glancing
up
at
Langdon.
And
tonight
he
was
forced
to
use
it
as
a
makeshift
code.
Her
grandfather's
voice
had
called
out
from
beyond
with
chilling
precision.
Leonardo
da
Vinci!
The
Mona
Lisa!
Why
his
final
words
to
her
referenced
the
famous
painting,
Sophie
had
no
idea,
but
she
could
think
of
only
one
possibility.
A
disturbing
one.
Those
were
not
his
final
words.
Was
she
supposed
to
visit
the
Mona
Lisa?
Had
her
grandfather
left
her
a
message
there?
The
idea
seemed
perfectly
plausible.
After
all,
the
famous
painting
hung
in
the
Salle
des
Etats
a
private
viewing
chamber
accessible
only
from
the
Grand
Gallery.
In
fact,
Sophie
now
realized,
the
doors
that
opened
into
the
chamber
were
situated
only
twenty
meters
from
where
her
grandfather
had
been
found
dead.
He
easily
could
have
visited
the
Mona
Lisa
before
he
died.
Sophie
gazed
back
up
the
emergency
stairwell
and
felt
torn.
She
knew
she
should
usher
Langdon
from
the
museum
immediately,
and
yet
instinct
urged
her
to
the
contrary.
As
Sophie
recalled
her
first
childhood
visit
to
the
Denon
Wing,
she
realized
that
if
her
grandfather
had
a
secret
to
tell
her,
few
places
on
earth
made
a
more
apt
rendezvous
than
Da
Vinci's
Mona
Lisa.
"She's
just
a
little
bit
farther,"
her
grandfather
had
whispered,
clutching
Sophie's
tiny
hand
as
he
led
her
through
the
deserted
museum
after
hours.
Sophie
was
six
years
old.
She
felt
small
and
insignificant
as
she
gazed
up
at
the
enormous
ceilings
and
down
at
the
dizzying
floor.
The
empty
museum
frightened
her,
although
she
was
not
about
to
let
her
grandfather
know
that.
She
set
her
jaw
firmly
and
let
go
of
his
hand.
"Up
ahead
is
the
Salle
des
Etats,"
her
grandfather
said
as
they
approached
the
Louvre's
most
famous
room.
Despite
her
grandfather's
obvious
excitement,
Sophie
wanted
to
go
home.
She
had
seen
pictures
of
the
Mona
Lisa
in
books
and
didn't
like
it
at
all.
She
couldn't
understand
why
everyone
made
such
a
fuss.
"C'est
ennuyeux,
"
Sophie
grumbled.
"Boring,"
he
corrected.
"French
at
school.
English
at
home."
"Le
Louvre,
c'est
pas
chez
moil"
she
challenged.
He
gave
her
a
tired
laugh.
"Right
you
are.
Then
let's
speak
English
just
for
fun."
Sophie
pouted
and
kept
walking.
As
they
entered
the
Salle
des
Etats,
her
eyes
scanned
the
narrow
room
and
settled
on
the
obvious
spot
of
honor
the
center
of
the
right
hand
wall,
where
a
lone
portrait
hung
behind
a
protective
Plexiglas
wall.
Her
grandfather
paused
in
the
doorway
and
motioned
toward
the
painting.
"Go
ahead,
Sophie.
Not
many
people
get
a
chance
to
visit
her
alone."
Swallowing
her
apprehension,
Sophie
moved
slowly
across
the
room.
After
everything
she'd
heard
about
the
Mona
Lisa,
she
felt
as
if
she
were
approaching
royalty.
Arriving
in
front
of
the
protective
Plexiglas,
Sophie
held
her
breath
and
looked
up,
taking
it
in
all
at
once.
Sophie
was
not
sure
what
she
had
expected
to
feel,
but
it
most
certainly
was
not
this.
No
jolt
of
amazement.
No
instant
of
wonder.
The
famous
face
looked
as
it
did
in
books.
She
stood
in
silence
for
what
felt
like
forever,
waiting
for
something
to
happen.
"So
what
do
you
think?"
her
grandfather
whispered,
arriving
behind
her.
"Beautiful,
yes?"
"She's
too
little."
Sauniere
smiled.
"You're
little
and
you're
beautiful."
am
not
beautiful,
she
thought.
Sophie
hated
her
red
hair
and
freckles,
and
she
was
bigger
than
all
the
boys
in
her
class.
She
looked
back
at
the
Mona
Lisa
and
shook
her
head.
"She's
even
worse
than
in
the
books.
Her
face
is
brumeux.
"Foggy,"
her
grandfather
tutored.
"Foggy,"
Sophie
repeated,
knowing
the
conversation
would
not
continue
until
she
repeated
her
new
vocabulary
word.
"That's
called
the
sfumato
style
of
painting,"
he
told
her,
"and
it's
very
hard
to
do.
Leonardo
da
Vinci
was
better
at
it
than
anyone."
Sophie
still
didn't
like
the
painting.
"She
looks
like
she
knows
something
like
when
kids
at
school
have
a
secret.
Her
grandfather
laughed.
"That's
part
of
why
she
is
so
famous.
People
like
to
guess
why
she
is
smiling."
"Do
you
know
why
she's
smiling?"
"Maybe."
Her
grandfather
winked.
"Someday
I'll
tell
you
all
about
it."
Sophie
stamped
her
foot.
"I
told
you
I
don't
like
secrets!"
"Princess,"
he
smiled.
"Life
is
filled
with
secrets.
You
can't
learn
them
all
at
once."
"I'm
going
back
up,"
Sophie
