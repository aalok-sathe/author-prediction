British
take
milk."
"Milk,"
Langdon
said.
Silence.
"Sugar?"
Teabing
made
no
reply.
Wait!
Langdon
now
recalled
the
bitter
beverage
he
had
been
served
on
his
last
visit
and
realized
this
question
was
a
trick.
"Lemon!"
he
declared.
"Earl
Grey
with
lemon"
"Indeed."
Teabing
sounded
deeply
amused
now.
"And
finally,
I
must
make
the
most
grave
of
inquiries."
Teabing
paused
and
then
spoke
in
a
solemn
tone.
"In
which
year
did
a
Harvard
sculler
last
outrow
an
Oxford
man
at
Henley?"
Langdon
had
no
idea,
but
he
could
imagine
only
one
reason
the
question
had
been
asked.
"Surely
such
a
travesty
has
never
occurred.
The
gate
clicked
open.
"Your
heart
is
true,
my
friend.
You
may
pass."
"Monsieur
Vernet!"
The
night
manager
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
felt
relieved
to
hear
the
bank
president's
voice
on
the
phone.
"Where
did
you
go,
sir?
The
police
are
here,
everyone
is
waiting
for
you!"
"I
have
a
little
problem,"
the
bank
president
said,
sounding
distressed.
"I
need
your
help
right
away."
You
have
more
than
a
little
problem,
the
manager
thought.
The
police
had
entirely
surrounded
the
bank
and
were
threatening
to
have
the
DCPJ
captain
himself
show
up
with
the
warrant
the
bank
had
demanded.
"How
can
I
help
you,
sir?"
"Armored
truck
number
three.
I
need
to
find
it."
Puzzled,
the
manager
checked
his
delivery
schedule.
"It's
here.
Downstairs
at
the
loading
dock."
"Actually,
no.
The
truck
was
stolen
by
the
two
individuals
the
police
are
tracking."
"What?
How
did
they
drive
out?"
"I
can't
go
into
the
specifics
on
the
phone,
but
we
have
a
situation
here
that
could
potentially
be
extremely
unfortunate
for
the
bank.
"What
do
you
need
me
to
do,
sir?"
"I'd
like
you
to
activate
the
truck's
emergency
transponder."
The
night
manager's
eyes
moved
to
the
LoJack
control
box
across
the
room.
Like
many
armored
cars,
each
of
the
bank's
trucks
had
been
equipped
with
a
radio
controlled
homing
device,
which
could
be
activated
remotely
from
the
bank.
The
manager
had
only
used
the
emergency
system
once,
after
a
hijacking,
and
it
had
worked
flawlessly
locating
the
truck
and
transmitting
the
coordinates
to
the
authorities
automatically.
Tonight,
however,
the
manager
had
the
impression
the
president
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
prudence.
"Sir,
you
are
aware
that
if
I
activate
the
LoJack
system,
the
transponder
will
simultaneously
inform
the
authorities
that
we
have
a
problem."
Vernet
was
silent
for
several
seconds.
"Yes,
I
know.
Do
it
anyway.
Truck
number
three.
I'll
hold.
I
need
the
exact
location
of
that
truck
the
instant
you
have
it."
"Right
away,
sir."
Thirty
seconds
later,
forty
kilometers
away,
hidden
in
the
undercarriage
of
the
armored
truck,
a
tiny
transponder
blinked
to
life.
As
Langdon
and
Sophie
drove
the
armored
truck
up
the
winding,
poplar
lined
driveway
toward
the
house,
Sophie
could
already
feel
her
muscles
relaxing.
It
was
a
relief
to
be
off
the
road,
and
she
could
think
of
few
safer
places
to
get
their
feet
under
them
than
this
private,
gated
estate
owned
by
a
good
natured
foreigner.
They
turned
into
the
sweeping
circular
driveway,
and
Chateau
Villette
came
into
view
on
their
right.
Three
stories
tall
and
at
least
sixty
meters
long,
the
edifice
had
gray
stone
facing
illuminated
by
outside
spotlights.
The
coarse
facade
stood
in
stark
juxtaposition
to
the
immaculately
landscaped
gardens
and
glassy
pond.
The
inside
lights
were
just
now
coming
on.
Rather
than
driving
to
the
front
door,
Langdon
pulled
into
a
parking
area
nestled
in
the
evergreens.
"No
reason
to
risk
being
spotted
from
the
road,"
he
said.
"Or
having
Leigh
wonder
why
we
arrived
in
a
wrecked
armored
truck."
Sophie
nodded.
"What
do
we
do
with
the
cryptex?
We
probably
shouldn't
leave
it
out
here,
but
if
Leigh
sees
it,
he'll
certainly
want
to
know
what
it
is."
"Not
to
worry,"
Langdon
said,
removing
his
jacket
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
car.
He
wrapped
the
tweed
coat
around
the
box
and
held
the
bundle
in
his
arms
like
a
baby.
Sophie
looked
dubious.
"Subtle."
"Teabing
never
answers
his
own
door;
he
prefers
to
make
an
entrance.
I'll
find
somewhere
inside
to
stash
this
before
he
joins
us."
Langdon
paused.
"Actually,
I
should
probably
warn
you
before
you
meet
him.
Sir
Leigh
has
a
sense
of
humor
that
people
often
find
a
bit
strange."
Sophie
doubted
anything
tonight
would
strike
her
as
strange
anymore.
The
pathway
to
the
main
entrance
was
hand
laid
cobblestone.
It
curved
to
a
door
of
carved
oak
and
cherry
with
a
brass
knocker
the
size
of
a
grapefruit.
Before
Sophie
could
grasp
the
knocker,
the
door
swung
open
from
within.
A
prim
and
elegant
butler
stood
before
them,
making
final
adjustments
on
the
white
tie
and
tuxedo
he
had
apparently
just
donned.
He
looked
to
be
about
fifty,
with
refined
features
and
an
austere
expression
that
left
little
doubt
he
was
unamused
by
their
presence
here.
"Sir
Leigh
will
be
down
presently,"
he
declared,
his
accent
thick
French.
"He
is
dressing.
He
prefers
not
to
greet
visitors
while
wearing
only
a
nightshirt.
May
I
take
your
coat?"
He
scowled
at
the
bunched
up
tweed
in
Langdon'
s
arms.
"Thank
you,
I'm
fine."
"Of
course
you
are.
Right
this
way,
please."
The
butler
guided
them
through
a
lush
marble
foyer
into
an
exquisitely
adorned
drawing
room,
softly
lit
by
tassel
draped
Victorian
lamps.
The
air
inside
smelled
antediluvian,
regal
somehow,
with
traces
of
pipe
tobacco,
tea
leaves,
cooking
sherry,
and
the
earthen
aroma
of
stone
architecture.
Against
the
far
wall,
flanked
between
two
glistening
suits
of
chain
mail
armor,
was
a
rough
hewn
fireplace
large
enough
to
roast
an
ox.
Walking
to
the
hearth,
the
butler
knelt
and
touched
a
match
to
a
pre
laid
arrangement
of
oak
logs
and
kindling.
A
fire
quickly
crackled
to
life.
The
man
stood,
straightening
his
jacket.
"His
master
requests
that
you
make
yourselves
at
home."
With
that,
he
departed,
leaving
Langdon
and
Sophie
alone.
Sophie
wondered
which
of
the
