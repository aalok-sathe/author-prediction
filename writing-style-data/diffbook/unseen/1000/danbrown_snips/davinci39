thirty
eight.
Verse
eleven.
Although
Silas
did
not
recall
the
exact
contents
of
verse
eleven
by
heart,
he
knew
the
Book
of
Job
told
the
story
of
a
man
whose
faith
in
God
survived
repeated
tests.
Appropriate,
he
thought,
barely
able
to
contain
his
excitement.
Looking
over
his
shoulder,
he
gazed
down
the
shimmering
Rose
Line
and
couldn't
help
but
smile.
There
atop
the
main
altar,
propped
open
on
a
gilded
book
stand,
sat
an
enormous
leather
bound
Bible.
Up
in
the
balcony,
Sister
Sandrine
was
shaking.
Moments
ago,
she
had
been
about
to
flee
and
carry
out
her
orders,
when
the
man
below
suddenly
removed
his
cloak.
When
she
saw
his
alabaster
white
flesh,
she
was
overcome
with
a
horrified
bewilderment.
His
broad,
pale
back
was
soaked
with
blood
red
slashes.
Even
from
here
she
could
see
the
wounds
were
fresh.
This
man
has
been
mercilessly
whipped!
She
also
saw
the
bloody
cilice
around
his
thigh,
the
wound
beneath
it
dripping.
What
kind
of
God
would
want
a
body
punished
this
way?
The
rituals
of
Opus
Dei,
Sister
Sandrine
knew,
were
not
something
she
would
ever
understand.
But
that
was
hardly
her
concern
at
this
instant.
Opus
Dei
is
searching
for
the
keystone.
How
they
knew
of
it,
Sister
Sandrine
could
not
imagine,
although
she
knew
she
did
not
have
time
to
think.
The
bloody
monk
was
now
quietly
donning
his
cloak
again,
clutching
his
prize
as
he
moved
toward
the
altar,
toward
the
Bible.
In
breathless
silence,
Sister
Sandrine
left
the
balcony
and
raced
down
the
hall
to
her
quarters.
Getting
on
her
hands
and
knees,
she
reached
beneath
her
wooden
bed
frame
and
retrieved
the
sealed
envelope
she
had
hidden
there
years
ago.
Tearing
it
open,
she
found
four
Paris
phone
numbers.
Trembling,
she
began
to
dial.
Downstairs,
Silas
laid
the
stone
tablet
on
the
altar
and
turned
his
eager
hands
to
the
leather
Bible.
His
long
white
fingers
were
sweating
now
as
he
turned
the
pages.
Flipping
through
the
Old
Testament,
he
found
the
Book
of
Job.
He
located
chapter
thirty
eight.
As
he
ran
his
finger
down
the
column
of
text,
he
anticipated
the
words
he
was
about
to
read.
They
will
lead
the
way!
Finding
verse
number
eleven,
Silas
read
the
text.
It
was
only
seven
words.
Confused,
he
read
it
again,
sensing
something
had
gone
terribly
wrong.
The
verse
simply
read:
HITHERTO
SHALT
THOU
COME,
BUT
NO
FURTHER.
Security
warden
Claude
Grouard
simmered
with
rage
as
he
stood
over
his
prostrate
captive
in
front
of
the
Mona
Lisa.
This
bastard
killed
Jacques
Sauniere!
Sauniere
had
been
like
a
well
loved
father
to
Grouard
and
his
security
team.
Grouard
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
pull
the
trigger
and
bury
a
bullet
in
Robert
Langdon's
back.
As
senior
warden,
Grouard
was
one
of
the
few
guards
who
actually
carried
a
loaded
weapon.
He
reminded
himself,
however,
that
killing
Langdon
would
be
a
generous
fate
compared
to
the
misery
about
to
be
communicated
by
Bezu
Fache
and
the
French
prison
system.
Grouard
yanked
his
walkie
talkie
off
his
belt
and
attempted
to
radio
for
backup.
All
he
heard
was
static.
The
additional
electronic
security
in
this
chamber
always
wrought
havoc
with
the
guards'
communications.
have
to
move
to
the
doorway.
Still
aiming
his
weapon
at
Langdon,
Grouard
began
backing
slowly
toward
the
entrance.
On
his
third
step,
he
spied
something
that
made
him
stop
short.
What
the
hell
is
that!
An
inexplicable
mirage
was
materializing
near
the
center
of
the
room.
A
silhouette.
There
was
someone
else
in
the
room?
A
woman
was
moving
through
the
darkness,
walking
briskly
toward
the
far
left
wall.
In
front
of
her,
a
purplish
beam
of
light
swung
back
and
forth
across
the
floor,
as
if
she
were
searching
for
something
with
a
colored
flashlight.
"Qui
est
la
?
"
Grouard
demanded,
feeling
his
adrenaline
spike
for
a
second
time
in
the
last
thirty
seconds.
He
suddenly
didn't
know
where
to
aim
his
gun
or
what
direction
to
move.
"PTS,"
the
woman
replied
calmly,
still
scanning
the
floor
with
her
light.
Police
Technique
et
Scientifique.
Grouard
was
sweating
now.
thought
all
the
agents
were
gone!
He
now
recognized
the
purple
light
as
ultraviolet,
consistent
with
a
PTS
team,
and
yet
he
could
not
understand
why
DCPJ
would
be
looking
for
evidence
in
here.
"Votre
nom!"
Grouard
yelled,
instinct
telling
him
something
was
amiss.
"Repondez!"
"C'est
mot,"
the
voice
responded
in
calm
French.
"Sophie
Neveu.
Somewhere
in
the
distant
recesses
of
Grouard's
mind,
the
name
registered.
Sophie
Neveu?
That
was
the
name
of
Sauniere's
granddaughter,
wasn't
it?
She
used
to
come
in
here
as
a
little
kid,
but
that
was
years
ago.
This
couldn't
possibly
be
her!
And
even
if
it
were
Sophie
Neveu,
that
was
hardly
a
reason
to
trust
her;
Grouard
had
heard
the
rumors
of
the
painful
falling
out
between
Sauniere
and
his
granddaughter.
"You
know
me,"
the
woman
called.
"And
Robert
Langdon
did
not
kill
my
grandfather.
Believe
me."
Warden
Grouard
was
not
about
to
take
that
on
faith.
need
backup!
Trying
his
walkie
talkie
again,
he
got
only
static.
The
entrance
was
still
a
good
twenty
yards
behind
him,
and
Grouard
began
backing
up
slowly,
choosing
to
leave
his
gun
trained
on
the
man
on
the
floor.
As
Grouard
inched
backward,
he
could
see
the
woman
across
the
room
raising
her
UV
light
and
scrutinizing
a
large
painting
that
hung
on
the
far
side
of
the
Salle
des
Etats,
directly
opposite
the
Mona
Lisa.
Grouard
gasped,
realizing
which
painting
it
was.
What
in
the
name
of
God
is
she
doing?
Across
the
room,
Sophie
Neveu
felt
a
cold
sweat
breaking
across
her
forehead.
Langdon
was
still
spread
eagle
on
the
floor.
Hold
on,
Robert.
Almost
there.
Knowing
the
guard
would
never
actually
shoot
either
of
them,
Sophie
now
turned
her
attention
back
to
the
matter
at
hand,
scanning
the
entire
area
around
one
masterpiece
in
particular
another
Da
Vinci.
But
the
UV
light
revealed
nothing
out
