to
her,
she
was
staring
aghast
at
the
top
of
the
black
marble
sarcophagus.
"Someone
was
here,"
she
whispered,
pointing
to
a
spot
on
the
sarcophagus
near
Newton's
outstretched
right
foot.
Langdon
did
not
understand
her
concern.
A
careless
tourist
had
left
a
charcoal,
grave
rubbing
pencil
on
the
sarcophagus
lid
near
Newton's
foot.
It's
nothing.
Langdon
reached
out
to
pick
it
up,
but
as
he
leaned
toward
the
sarcophagus,
the
light
shifted
on
the
polished
black
marble
slab,
and
Langdon
froze.
Suddenly,
he
saw
why
Sophie
was
afraid.
Scrawled
on
the
sarcophagus
lid,
at
Newton's
feet,
shimmered
a
barely
visible
charcoal
pencil
message:
I
have
Teabing.
Go
through
Chapter
House,
out
south
exit,
to
public
garden.
Langdon
read
the
words
twice,
his
heart
pounding
wildly.
Sophie
turned
and
scanned
the
nave.
Despite
the
pall
of
trepidation
that
settled
over
him
upon
seeing
the
words,
Langdon
told
himself
this
was
good
news.
Leigh
is
still
alive.
There
was
another
implication
here
too.
"They
don't
know
the
password
either,"
he
whispered.
Sophie
nodded.
Otherwise
why
make
their
presence
known?
"They
may
want
to
trade
Leigh
for
the
password."
"Or
it's
a
trap."
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"I
don't
think
so.
The
garden
is
outside
the
abbey
walls.
A
very
public
place."
Langdon
had
once
visited
the
abbey's
famous
College
Garden
a
small
fruit
orchard
and
herb
garden
left
over
from
the
days
when
monks
grew
natural
pharmacological
remedies
here.
Boasting
the
oldest
living
fruit
trees
in
Great
Britain,
College
Garden
was
a
popular
spot
for
tourists
to
visit
without
having
to
enter
the
abbey.
"I
think
sending
us
outside
is
a
show
of
faith.
So
we
feel
safe."
Sophie
looked
dubious.
"You
mean
outside,
where
there
are
no
metal
detectors?"
Langdon
scowled.
She
had
a
point.
Gazing
back
at
the
orb
filled
tomb,
Langdon
wished
he
had
some
idea
about
the
cryptex
password
something
with
which
to
negotiate.
got
Leigh
involved
in
this,
and
I'll
do
whatever
it
takes
if
there
is
a
chance
to
help
him.
"The
note
says
to
go
through
the
Chapter
House
to
the
south
exit,"
Sophie
said.
"Maybe
from
the
exit
we
would
have
a
view
of
the
garden?
That
way
we
could
assess
the
situation
before
we
walked
out
there
and
exposed
ourselves
to
any
danger?"
The
idea
was
a
good
one.
Langdon
vaguely
recalled
the
Chapter
House
as
a
huge
octagonal
hall
where
the
original
British
Parliament
convened
in
the
days
before
the
modern
Parliament
building
existed.
It
had
been
years
since
he
had
been
there,
but
he
remembered
it
being
out
through
the
cloister
somewhere.
Taking
several
steps
back
from
the
tomb,
Langdon
peered
around
the
choir
screen
to
his
right,
across
the
nave
to
the
side
opposite
that
which
they
had
descended.
A
gaping
vaulted
passageway
stood
nearby,
with
a
large
sign.
THIS
WAY
TO:
CLOISTERS
DEANERY
COLLEGE
HALL
MUSEUM
PYX
CHAMBER
ST.
FAITH'S
CHAPEL
Langdon
and
Sophie
were
jogging
as
they
passed
beneath
the
sign,
moving
too
quickly
to
notice
the
small
announcement
apologizing
that
certain
areas
were
closed
for
renovations.
They
emerged
immediately
into
a
high
walled,
open
roof
courtyard
through
which
morning
rain
was
falling.
Above
them,
the
wind
howled
across
the
opening
with
a
low
drone,
like
someone
blowing
over
the
mouth
of
a
bottle.
Entering
the
narrow,
low
hanging
walkways
that
bordered
the
courtyard
perimeter,
Langdon
felt
the
familiar
uneasiness
he
always
felt
in
enclosed
spaces.
These
walkways
were
called
cloisters,
and
Langdon
noted
with
uneasiness
that
these
particular
cloisters
lived
up
to
their
Latin
ties
to
the
word
claustrophobic.
Focusing
his
mind
straight
ahead
toward
the
end
of
the
tunnel,
Langdon
followed
the
signs
for
the
that
blew
through
the
lone
pillared
wall
that
was
the
cloister's
only
source
of
light.
Another
couple
scurried
past
them
the
other
way,
hurrying
to
get
out
of
the
worsening
weather.
The
cloisters
looked
deserted
now,
admittedly
the
abbey's
least
enticing
section
in
the
wind
and
rain.
Forty
yards
down
the
east
cloister,
an
archway
materialized
on
their
left,
giving
way
to
another
hallway.
Although
this
was
the
entrance
they
were
looking
for,
the
opening
was
cordoned
off
by
a
swag
and
an
official
looking
sign.
CLOSED
FOR
RENOVATION
PYX
CHAMBER
ST.
FAITH'S
CHAPEL
The
long,
deserted
corridor
beyond
the
swag
was
littered
with
scaffolding
and
drop
cloths.
Immediately
beyond
the
swag,
Langdon
could
see
the
entrances
to
the
Pyx
Chamber
and
St.
Faith's
Chapel
on
the
right
and
left.
The
entrance
to
the
Chapter
House,
however,
was
much
farther
away,
at
the
far
end
of
the
long
hallway.
Even
from
here,
Langdon
could
see
that
its
heavy
wooden
door
was
wide
open,
and
the
spacious
octagonal
interior
was
bathed
in
a
grayish
natural
light
from
the
room's
enormous
windows
that
looked
out
on
College
Garden.
Go
through
Chapter
House,
out
south
exit,
to
public
garden.
"We
just
left
the
east
cloister,"
Langdon
said,
"so
the
south
exit
to
the
garden
must
be
through
there
and
to
the
right."
Sophie
was
already
stepping
over
the
swag
and
moving
forward.
As
they
hurried
down
the
dark
corridor,
the
sounds
of
the
wind
and
rain
from
the
open
cloister
faded
behind
them.
The
Chapter
House
was
a
kind
of
satellite
structure
a
freestanding
annex
at
the
end
of
the
long
hallway
to
ensure
the
privacy
of
the
Parliament
proceedings
housed
there.
"It
looks
huge,"
Sophie
whispered
as
they
approached.
Langdon
had
forgotten
just
how
large
this
room
was.
Even
from
outside
the
entrance,
he
could
gaze
across
the
vast
expanse
of
floor
to
the
breathtaking
windows
on
the
far
side
of
the
octagon,
which
rose
five
stories
to
a
vaulted
ceiling.
They
would
certainly
have
a
clear
view
of
the
garden
from
in
here.
Crossing
the
threshold,
both
Langdon
and
Sophie
found
themselves
having
to
squint.
After
the
gloomy
cloisters,
the
Chapter
House
felt
like
a
solarium.
They
were
a
good
ten
feet
into
the
room,
searching
the
south
wall,
when
they
realized
the
door
they
had
been
promised
was
not
there.
