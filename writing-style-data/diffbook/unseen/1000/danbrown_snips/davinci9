decade,
he
had
been
following
The
Way,
cleansing
himself
of
sins
rebuilding
his
life
erasing
the
violence
in
his
past.
Tonight,
however,
it
had
all
come
rushing
back.
The
hatred
he
had
fought
so
hard
to
bury
had
been
summoned.
He
had
been
startled
how
quickly
his
past
had
resurfaced.
And
with
it,
of
course,
had
come
his
skills.
Rusty
but
serviceable.
Jesus'
message
is
one
of
peace
of
nonviolence
of
love.
This
was
the
message
Silas
had
been
taught
from
the
beginning,
and
the
message
he
held
in
his
heart.
And
yet
this
was
the
message
the
enemies
of
Christ
now
threatened
to
destroy.
Those
who
threaten
God
with
force
will
be
met
with
force.
Immovable
and
steadfast.
For
two
millennia,
Christian
soldiers
had
defended
their
faith
against
those
who
tried
to
displace
it.
Tonight,
Silas
had
been
called
to
battle.
Drying
his
wounds,
he
donned
his
ankle
length,
hooded
robe.
It
was
plain,
made
of
dark
wool,
accentuating
the
whiteness
of
his
skin
and
hair.
Tightening
the
rope
tie
around
his
waist,
he
raised
the
hood
over
his
head
and
allowed
his
red
eyes
to
admire
his
reflection
in
the
mirror.
The
wheels
are
in
motion.
Having
squeezed
beneath
the
security
gate,
Robert
Langdon
now
stood
just
inside
the
entrance
to
the
Grand
Gallery.
He
was
staring
into
the
mouth
of
a
long,
deep
canyon.
On
either
side
of
the
gallery,
stark
walls
rose
thirty
feet,
evaporating
into
the
darkness
above.
The
reddish
glow
of
the
service
lighting
sifted
upward,
casting
an
unnatural
smolder
across
a
staggering
collection
of
Da
Vincis,
Titians,
and
Caravaggios
that
hung
suspended
from
ceiling
cables.
Still
lifes,
religious
scenes,
and
landscapes
accompanied
portraits
of
nobility
and
politicians.
Although
the
Grand
Gallery
housed
the
Louvre's
most
famous
Italian
art,
many
visitors
felt
the
wing's
most
stunning
offering
was
actually
its
famous
parquet
floor.
Laid
out
in
a
dazzling
geometric
design
of
diagonal
oak
slats,
the
floor
produced
an
ephemeral
optical
illusion
a
multi
dimensional
network
that
gave
visitors
the
sense
they
were
floating
through
the
gallery
on
a
surface
that
changed
with
every
step.
As
Langdon's
gaze
began
to
trace
the
inlay,
his
eyes
stopped
short
on
an
unexpected
object
lying
on
the
floor
just
a
few
yards
to
his
left,
surrounded
by
police
tape.
He
spun
toward
Fache.
"Is
that
a
Caravaggio
on
the
floor?"
Fache
nodded
without
even
looking.
The
painting,
Langdon
guessed,
was
worth
upward
of
two
million
dollars,
and
yet
it
was
lying
on
the
floor
like
a
discarded
poster.
"What
the
devil
is
it
doing
on
the
floor!"
Fache
glowered,
clearly
unmoved.
"This
is
a
crime
scene,
Mr.
Langdon.
We
have
touched
nothing.
That
canvas
was
pulled
from
the
wall
by
the
curator.
It
was
how
he
activated
the
security
system."
Langdon
looked
back
at
the
gate,
trying
to
picture
what
had
happened.
"The
curator
was
attacked
in
his
office,
fled
into
the
Grand
Gallery,
and
activated
the
security
gate
by
pulling
that
painting
from
the
wall.
The
gate
fell
immediately,
sealing
off
all
access.
This
is
the
only
door
in
or
out
of
this
gallery."
Langdon
felt
confused.
"So
the
curator
actually
captured
his
attacker
inside
the
Grand
Gallery?"
Fache
shook
his
head.
"The
security
gate
separated
Sauniere
from
his
attacker.
The
killer
was
locked
out
there
in
the
hallway
and
shot
Sauniere
through
this
gate."
Fache
pointed
toward
an
orange
tag
hanging
from
one
of
the
bars
on
the
gate
under
which
they
had
just
passed.
"The
PTS
team
found
flashback
residue
from
a
gun.
He
fired
through
the
bars.
Sauniere
died
in
here
alone."
Langdon
pictured
the
photograph
of
Sauniere's
body.
They
said
he
did
that
to
himself.
Langdon
looked
out
at
the
enormous
corridor
before
them.
"So
where
is
his
body?"
Fache
straightened
his
cruciform
tie
clip
and
began
to
walk.
"As
you
probably
know,
the
Grand
Gallery
is
quite
long."
The
exact
length,
if
Langdon
recalled
correctly,
was
around
fifteen
hundred
feet,
the
length
of
three
Washington
Monuments
laid
end
to
end.
Equally
breathtaking
was
the
corridor's
width,
which
easily
could
have
accommodated
a
pair
of
side
by
side
passenger
trains.
The
center
of
the
hallway
was
dotted
by
the
occasional
statue
or
colossal
porcelain
urn,
which
served
as
a
tasteful
divider
and
kept
the
flow
of
traffic
moving
down
one
wall
and
up
the
other.
Fache
was
silent
now,
striding
briskly
up
the
right
side
of
the
corridor
with
his
gaze
dead
ahead.
Langdon
felt
almost
disrespectful
to
be
racing
past
so
many
masterpieces
without
pausing
for
so
much
as
a
glance.
Not
that
I
could
see
anything
in
this
lighting,
he
thought.
The
muted
crimson
lighting
unfortunately
conjured
memories
of
Langdon'
s
last
experience
in
noninvasive
lighting
in
the
Vatican
Secret
Archives.
This
was
tonight's
second
unsettling
parallel
with
his
near
death
in
Rome.
He
flashed
on
Vittoria
again.
She
had
been
absent
from
his
dreams
for
months.
Langdon
could
not
believe
Rome
had
been
only
a
year
ago;
it
felt
like
decades.
Another
life.
His
last
correspondence
from
Vittoria
had
been
in
December
a
postcard
saying
she
was
headed
to
the
Java
Sea
to
continue
her
research
in
entanglement
physics
something
about
using
satellites
to
track
manta
ray
migrations.
Langdon
had
never
harbored
delusions
that
a
woman
like
Vittoria
Vetra
could
have
been
happy
living
with
him
on
a
college
campus,
but
their
encounter
in
Rome
had
unlocked
in
him
a
longing
he
never
imagined
he
could
feel.
His
lifelong
affinity
for
bachelorhood
and
the
simple
freedoms
it
allowed
had
been
shaken
somehow
replaced
by
an
unexpected
emptiness
that
seemed
to
have
grown
over
the
past
year.
They
continued
walking
briskly,
yet
Langdon
still
saw
no
corpse.
"Jacques
Sauniere
went
this
far?"
"Mr.
Sauniere
suffered
a
bullet
wound
to
his
stomach.
He
died
very
slowly.
Perhaps
over
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes.
He
was
obviously
a
man
of
great
personal
strength."
Langdon
turned,
appalled.
"Security
took
fifteen
minutes
to
get
here?"
"Of
course
not.
Louvre
security
responded
immediately
to
the
alarm
and
