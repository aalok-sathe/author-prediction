to
a
powerful
young
man.
When
people
passed
by,
he
could
hear
them
whispering
to
one
another.
A
ghost,
they
would
say,
their
eyes
wide
with
fright
as
they
stared
at
his
white
skin.
A
ghost
with
the
eyes
of
a
devil!
And
he
felt
like
a
ghost
transparent
floating
from
seaport
to
seaport.
People
seemed
to
look
right
through
him.
At
eighteen,
in
a
port
town,
while
attempting
to
steal
a
case
of
cured
ham
from
a
cargo
ship,
he
was
caught
by
a
pair
of
crewmen.
The
two
sailors
who
began
to
beat
him
smelled
of
beer,
just
as
his
father
had.
The
memories
of
fear
and
hatred
surfaced
like
a
monster
from
the
deep.
The
young
man
broke
the
first
sailor's
neck
with
his
bare
hands,
and
only
the
arrival
of
the
police
saved
the
second
sailor
from
a
similar
fate.
Two
months
later,
in
shackles,
he
arrived
at
a
prison
in
Andorra.
You
are
as
white
as
a
ghost,
the
inmates
ridiculed
as
the
guards
marched
him
in,
naked
and
cold.
Mira
el
espectro!
Perhaps
the
ghost
will
pass
right
through
these
walls!
Over
the
course
of
twelve
years,
his
flesh
and
soul
withered
until
he
knew
he
had
become
transparent.
am
a
ghost.
I
am
weightless.
Yo
soy
un
espectro
palido
coma
unafantasma
caminando
este
mundo
a
solas.
One
night
the
ghost
awoke
to
the
screams
of
other
inmates.
He
didn't
know
what
invisible
force
was
shaking
the
floor
on
which
he
slept,
nor
what
mighty
hand
was
trembling
the
mortar
of
his
stone
cell,
but
as
he
jumped
to
his
feet,
a
large
boulder
toppled
onto
the
very
spot
where
he
had
been
sleeping.
Looking
up
to
see
where
the
stone
had
come
from,
he
saw
a
hole
in
the
trembling
wall,
and
beyond
it,
a
vision
he
had
not
seen
in
over
ten
years.
The
moon.
Even
while
the
earth
still
shook,
the
ghost
found
himself
scrambling
through
a
narrow
tunnel,
staggering
out
into
an
expansive
vista,
and
tumbling
down
a
barren
mountainside
into
the
woods.
He
ran
all
night,
always
downward,
delirious
with
hunger
and
exhaustion.
Skirting
the
edges
of
consciousness,
he
found
himself
at
dawn
in
a
clearing
where
train
tracks
cut
a
swath
across
the
forest.
Following
the
rails,
he
moved
on
as
if
dreaming.
Seeing
an
empty
freight
car,
he
crawled
in
for
shelter
and
rest.
When
he
awoke
the
train
was
moving.
How
long?
How
far?
A
pain
was
growing
in
his
gut.
Am
I
dying
?
He
slept
again.
This
time
he
awoke
to
someone
yelling,
beating
him,
throwing
him
out
of
the
freight
car.
Bloody,
he
wandered
the
outskirts
of
a
small
village
looking
in
vain
for
food.
Finally,
his
body
too
weak
to
take
another
step,
he
lay
down
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
slipped
into
unconsciousness.
The
light
came
slowly,
and
the
ghost
wondered
how
long
he
had
been
dead.
A
day?
Three
days?
It
didn't
matter.
His
bed
was
soft
like
a
cloud,
and
the
air
around
him
smelled
sweet
with
candles.
Jesus
was
there,
staring
down
at
him.
am
here,
Jesus
said.
The
stone
has
been
rolled
aside,
and
you
are
born
again.
He
slept
and
awoke.
Fog
shrouded
his
thoughts.
He
had
never
believed
in
heaven,
and
yet
Jesus
was
watching
over
him.
Food
appeared
beside
his
bed,
and
the
ghost
ate
it,
almost
able
to
feel
the
flesh
materializing
on
his
bones.
He
slept
again.
When
he
awoke,
Jesus
was
still
smiling
down,
speaking.
You
are
saved,
my
son.
Blessed
are
those
who
follow
my
path.
Again,
he
slept.
It
was
a
scream
of
anguish
that
startled
the
ghost
from
his
slumber.
His
body
leapt
out
of
bed,
staggered
down
a
hallway
toward
the
sounds
of
shouting.
He
entered
into
a
kitchen
and
saw
a
large
man
beating
a
smaller
man.
Without
knowing
why,
the
ghost
grabbed
the
large
man
and
hurled
him
backward
against
a
wall.
The
man
fled,
leaving
the
ghost
standing
over
the
body
of
a
young
man
in
priest's
robes.
The
priest
had
a
badly
shattered
nose.
Lifting
the
bloody
priest,
the
ghost
carried
him
to
a
couch.
"Thank
you,
my
friend,"
the
priest
said
in
awkward
French.
"The
offertory
money
is
tempting
for
thieves.
You
speak
French
in
your
sleep.
Do
you
also
speak
Spanish?"
The
ghost
shook
his
head.
"What
is
your
name?"
he
continued
in
broken
French.
The
ghost
could
not
remember
the
name
his
parents
had
given
him.
All
he
heard
were
the
taunting
gibes
of
the
prison
guards.
The
priest
smiled.
"No
hay
problema.
My
name
is
Manuel
Aringarosa.
I
am
a
missionary
from
Madrid.
I
was
sent
here
to
build
a
church
for
the
Obra
de
Dios."
"Where
am
I?"
His
voice
sounded
hollow.
"Oviedo.
In
the
north
of
Spain."
"How
did
I
get
here?"
"Someone
left
you
on
my
doorstep.
You
were
ill.
I
fed
you.
You've
been
here
many
days."
The
ghost
studied
his
young
caretaker.
Years
had
passed
since
anyone
had
shown
any
kindness.
"Thank
you,
Father."
The
priest
touched
his
bloody
lip.
"It
is
I
who
am
thankful,
my
friend."
When
the
ghost
awoke
in
the
morning,
his
world
felt
clearer.
He
gazed
up
at
the
crucifix
on
the
wall
above
his
bed.
Although
it
no
longer
spoke
to
him,
he
felt
a
comforting
aura
in
its
presence.
Sitting
up,
he
was
surprised
to
find
a
newspaper
clipping
on
his
bedside
table.
The
article
was
in
French,
a
week
old.
When
he
read
the
story,
he
filled
with
fear.
It
told
of
an
earthquake
in
the
mountains
that
had
destroyed
a
prison
and
freed
many
dangerous
criminals.
His
heart
began
pounding.
The
priest
knows
who
I
am!
The
emotion
he
felt
was
one
he
had
not
felt
for
some
time.
Shame.
Guilt.
It
was
accompanied
by
the
fear
of
being
caught.
He
jumped
from
his
bed.
Where
do
I
run
?
"The
Book
of
Acts,"
a
voice
said
from
the
door.
The
ghost
turned,
