more
important,
they
are
known
as
the
guardians
of
an
ancient
secret.
One
that
made
them
immeasurably
powerful."
Despite
the
total
conviction
in
Langdon's
eyes,
Sophie's
gut
reaction
was
one
of
stark
disbelief.
A
secret
pagan
cult?
Once
headed
by
Leonardo
da
Vinci?
It
all
sounded
utterly
absurd.
And
yet,
even
as
she
dismissed
it,
she
felt
her
mind
reeling
back
ten
years
to
the
night
she
had
mistakenly
surprised
her
grandfather
and
witnessed
what
she
still
could
not
accept.
Could
that
explain
?
"The
identities
of
living
Priory
members
are
kept
extremely
secret,"
Langdon
said,
"but
the
P.S.
and
fleur
de
lis
that
you
saw
as
a
child
are
proof.
It
could
only
have
been
related
to
the
Priory."
Sophie
realized
now
that
Langdon
knew
far
more
about
her
grandfather
than
she
had
previously
imagined.
This
American
obviously
had
volumes
to
share
with
her,
but
this
was
not
the
place.
"I
can't
afford
to
let
them
catch
you,
Robert.
There's
a
lot
we
need
to
discuss.
You
need
to
go!"
Langdon
heard
only
the
faint
murmur
of
her
voice.
He
wasn't
going
anywhere.
He
was
lost
in
another
place
now.
A
place
where
ancient
secrets
rose
to
the
surface.
A
place
where
forgotten
histories
emerged
from
the
shadows.
Slowly,
as
if
moving
underwater,
Langdon
turned
his
head
and
gazed
through
the
reddish
haze
toward
the
Mona
Lisa.
The
fleur
de
lis
the
flower
of
Lisa
the
Mona
Lisa.
It
was
all
intertwined,
a
silent
symphony
echoing
the
deepest
secrets
of
the
Priory
of
Sion
and
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
A
few
miles
away,
on
the
riverbank
beyond
Les
Invalides,
the
bewildered
driver
of
a
twin
bed
Trailor
truck
stood
at
gunpoint
and
watched
as
the
captain
of
the
Judicial
Police
let
out
a
guttural
roar
of
rage
and
heaved
a
bar
of
soap
out
into
the
turgid
waters
of
the
Seine.
Silas
gazed
upward
at
the
Saint
Sulpice
obelisk,
taking
in
the
length
of
the
massive
marble
shaft.
His
sinews
felt
taut
with
exhilaration.
He
glanced
around
the
church
one
more
time
to
make
sure
he
was
alone.
Then
he
knelt
at
the
base
of
the
structure,
not
out
of
reverence,
but
out
of
necessity.
The
keystone
is
hidden
beneath
the
Rose
Line.
At
the
base
of
the
Sulpice
obelisk.
All
the
brothers
had
concurred.
On
his
knees
now,
Silas
ran
his
hands
across
the
stone
floor.
He
saw
no
cracks
or
markings
to
indicate
a
movable
tile,
so
he
began
rapping
softly
with
his
knuckles
on
the
floor.
Following
the
brass
line
closer
to
the
obelisk,
he
knocked
on
each
tile
adjacent
to
the
brass
line.
Finally,
one
of
them
echoed
strangely.
There's
a
hollow
area
beneath
the
floor!
Silas
smiled.
His
victims
had
spoken
the
truth.
Standing,
he
searched
the
sanctuary
for
something
with
which
to
break
the
floor
tile.
High
above
Silas,
in
the
balcony,
Sister
Sandrine
stifled
a
gasp.
Her
darkest
fears
had
just
been
confirmed.
This
visitor
was
not
who
he
seemed.
The
mysterious
Opus
Dei
monk
had
come
to
Saint
Sulpice
for
another
purpose.
A
secret
purpose.
You
are
not
the
only
one
with
secrets,
she
thought.
Sister
Sandrine
Bieil
was
more
than
the
keeper
of
this
church.
She
was
a
sentry.
And
tonight,
the
ancient
wheels
had
been
set
in
motion.
The
arrival
of
this
stranger
at
the
base
of
the
obelisk
was
a
signal
from
the
brotherhood.
It
was
a
silent
call
of
distress.
The
U.S.
Embassy
in
Paris
is
a
compact
complex
on
Avenue
Gabriel,
just
north
of
the
Champs
Elysees.
The
three
acre
compound
is
considered
U.S.
soil,
meaning
all
those
who
stand
on
it
are
subject
to
the
same
laws
and
protections
as
they
would
encounter
standing
in
the
United
States.
The
embassy's
night
operator
was
reading
Time
magazine's
International
Edition
when
the
sound
of
her
phone
interrupted.
"U.S.
Embassy,"
she
answered.
"Good
evening."
The
caller
spoke
English
accented
with
French.
"I
need
some
assistance."
Despite
the
politeness
of
the
man's
words,
his
tone
sounded
gruff
and
official.
"I
was
told
you
had
a
phone
message
for
me
on
your
automated
system.
The
name
is
Langdon.
Unfortunately,
I
have
forgotten
my
three
digit
access
code.
If
you
could
help
me,
I
would
be
most
grateful."
The
operator
paused,
confused.
"I'm
sorry,
sir.
Your
message
must
be
quite
old.
That
system
was
removed
two
years
ago
for
security
precautions.
Moreover,
all
the
access
codes
were
five
digit.
Who
told
you
we
had
a
message
for
you?"
"You
have
no
automated
phone
system?"
"No,
sir.
Any
message
for
you
would
be
handwritten
in
our
services
department.
What
was
your
name
again?"
But
the
man
had
hung
up.
Bezu
Fache
felt
dumbstruck
as
he
paced
the
banks
of
the
Seine.
He
was
certain
he
had
seen
Langdon
dial
a
local
number,
enter
a
three
digit
code,
and
then
listen
to
a
recording.
But
if
Langdon
didn't
phone
the
embassy,
then
who
the
hell
did
he
call?
It
was
at
that
moment,
eyeing
his
cellular
phone,
that
Fache
realized
the
answers
were
in
the
palm
of
his
hand.
Langdon
used
my
phone
to
place
that
call.
Keying
into
the
cell
phone's
menu,
Fache
pulled
up
the
list
of
recently
dialed
numbers
and
found
the
call
Langdon
had
placed.
A
Paris
exchange,
followed
by
the
three
digit
code
454.
Redialing
the
phone
number,
Fache
waited
as
the
line
began
ringing.
Finally
a
woman's
voice
answered.
"Bonjour,
vous
etes
bien
chez
Sophie
Neveu,
"
the
recording
announced.
"Je
suis
absente
pour
le
moment,
mais"
Fache's
blood
was
boiling
as
he
typed
the
numbers
4
5
4.
Despite
her
monumental
reputation,
the
Mona
Lisa
was
a
mere
thirty
one
inches
by
twenty
one
inches
smaller
even
than
the
posters
of
her
sold
in
the
Louvre
gift
shop.
She
hung
on
the
northwest
wall
of
the
Salle
des
Etats
behind
a
two
inch
thick
pane
of
protective
Plexiglas.
Painted
on
a
poplar
wood
panel,
her
ethereal,
mist
filled
atmosphere
was
attributed
to
Da
Vinci's
mastery
of
the
