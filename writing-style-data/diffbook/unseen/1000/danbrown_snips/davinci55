small
television
he
was
watching
and
greeted
them
with
a
pleasant
smile.
Despite
his
enormous
muscles
and
visible
sidearm,
his
diction
chimed
with
the
polished
courtesy
of
a
Swiss
bellhop.
"Bonsoir,
"
he
said.
"How
may
I
help
you?"
The
dual
language
greeting
was
the
newest
hospitality
trick
of
the
European
host.
It
presumed
nothing
and
opened
the
door
for
the
guest
to
reply
in
whichever
language
was
more
comfortable.
Sophie
replied
with
neither.
She
simply
laid
the
gold
key
on
the
counter
in
front
of
the
man.
The
man
glanced
down
and
immediately
stood
straighter.
"Of
course.
Your
elevator
is
at
the
end
of
the
hall.
I
will
alert
someone
that
you
are
on
your
way."
Sophie
nodded
and
took
her
key
back.
"Which
floor?"
The
man
gave
her
an
odd
look.
"Your
key
instructs
the
elevator
which
floor."
She
smiled.
"Ah,
yes."
The
guard
watched
as
the
two
newcomers
made
their
way
to
the
elevators,
inserted
their
key,
boarded
the
lift,
and
disappeared.
As
soon
as
the
door
had
closed,
he
grabbed
the
phone.
He
was
not
calling
to
alert
anyone
of
their
arrival;
there
was
no
need
for
that.
A
vault
greeter
already
had
been
alerted
automatically
when
the
client's
key
was
inserted
outside
in
the
entry
gate.
Instead,
the
guard
was
calling
the
bank's
night
manager.
As
the
line
rang,
the
guard
switched
the
television
back
on
and
stared
at
it.
The
news
story
he
had
been
watching
was
just
ending.
It
didn't
matter.
He
got
another
look
at
the
two
faces
on
the
television.
The
manager
answered.
"Oui?"
"We
have
a
situation
down
here."
"What's
happening?"
the
manager
demanded.
"The
French
police
are
tracking
two
fugitives
tonight."
"So?"
"Both
of
them
just
walked
into
our
bank."
The
manager
cursed
quietly.
"Okay.
I'll
contact
Monsieur
Vernet
immediately."
The
guard
then
hung
up
and
placed
a
second
call.
This
one
to
Interpol.
Langdon
was
surprised
to
feel
the
elevator
dropping
rather
than
climbing.
He
had
no
idea
how
many
floors
they
had
descended
beneath
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
before
the
door
finally
opened.
He
didn't
care.
He
was
happy
to
be
out
of
the
elevator.
Displaying
impressive
alacrity,
a
host
was
already
standing
there
to
greet
them.
He
was
elderly
and
pleasant,
wearing
a
neatly
pressed
flannel
suit
that
made
him
look
oddly
out
of
place
an
old
world
banker
in
a
high
tech
world.
"Bonsoir,
"
the
man
said.
"Good
evening.
Would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
follow
me,
s'il
vous
plait?"
Without
waiting
for
a
response,
he
spun
on
his
heel
and
strode
briskly
down
a
narrow
metal
corridor.
Langdon
walked
with
Sophie
down
a
series
of
corridors,
past
several
large
rooms
filled
with
blinking
mainframe
computers.
"Void,
"
their
host
said,
arriving
at
a
steel
door
and
opening
it
for
them.
"Here
you
are."
Langdon
and
Sophie
stepped
into
another
world.
The
small
room
before
them
looked
like
a
lavish
sitting
room
at
a
fine
hotel.
Gone
were
the
metal
and
rivets,
replaced
with
oriental
carpets,
dark
oak
furniture,
and
cushioned
chairs.
On
the
broad
desk
in
the
middle
of
the
room,
two
crystal
glasses
sat
beside
an
opened
bottle
of
Perrier,
its
bubbles
still
fizzing.
A
pewter
pot
of
coffee
steamed
beside
it.
Clockwork,
Langdon
thought.
Leave
it
to
the
Swiss.
The
man
gave
a
perceptive
smile.
"I
sense
this
is
your
first
visit
to
us?"
Sophie
hesitated
and
then
nodded.
"Understood.
Keys
are
often
passed
on
as
inheritance,
and
our
first
time
users
are
invariably
uncertain
of
the
protocol."
He
motioned
to
the
table
of
drinks.
"This
room
is
yours
as
long
as
you
care
to
use
it."
"You
say
keys
are
sometimes
inherited?"
Sophie
asked.
"Indeed.
Your
key
is
like
a
Swiss
numbered
account,
which
are
often
willed
through
generations.
On
our
gold
accounts,
the
shortest
safety
deposit
box
lease
is
fifty
years.
Paid
in
advance.
So
we
see
plenty
of
family
turnover.
Langdon
stared.
"Did
you
say
fifty
years?"
"At
a
minimum,"
their
host
replied.
"Of
course,
you
can
purchase
much
longer
leases,
but
barring
further
arrangements,
if
there
is
no
activity
on
an
account
for
fifty
years,
the
contents
of
that
safe
deposit
box
are
automatically
destroyed.
Shall
I
run
through
the
process
of
accessing
your
box?"
Sophie
nodded.
"Please."
Their
host
swept
an
arm
across
the
luxurious
salon.
"This
is
your
private
viewing
room.
Once
I
leave
the
room,
you
may
spend
all
the
time
you
need
in
here
to
review
and
modify
the
contents
of
your
safe
deposit
box,
which
arrives
over
here."
He
walked
them
to
the
far
wall
where
a
wide
conveyor
belt
entered
the
room
in
a
graceful
curve,
vaguely
resembling
a
baggage
claim
carousel.
"You
insert
your
key
in
that
slot
there."
The
man
pointed
to
a
large
electronic
podium
facing
the
conveyor
belt.
The
podium
had
a
familiar
triangular
hole.
"Once
the
computer
confirms
the
markings
on
your
key,
you
enter
your
account
number,
and
your
safe
deposit
box
will
be
retrieved
robotically
from
the
vault
below
for
your
inspection.
When
you
are
finished
with
your
box,
you
place
it
back
on
the
conveyor
belt,
insert
your
key
again,
and
the
process
is
reversed.
Because
everything
is
automated,
your
privacy
is
guaranteed,
even
from
the
staff
of
this
bank.
If
you
need
anything
at
all,
simply
press
the
call
button
on
the
table
in
the
center
of
the
room."
Sophie
was
about
to
ask
a
question
when
a
telephone
rang.
The
man
looked
puzzled
and
embarrassed.
"Excuse
me,
please."
He
walked
over
to
the
phone,
which
was
sitting
on
the
table
beside
the
coffee
and
Perrier.
"Oui?"
he
answered.
His
brow
furrowed
as
he
listened
to
the
caller.
"Oui
oui
d'
accord.
"
He
hung
up,
and
gave
them
an
uneasy
smile.
"I'm
sorry,
I
must
leave
you
now.
Make
yourselves
at
home."
He
moved
quickly
toward
the
door.
"Excuse
me,"
Sophie
called.
"Could
you
clarify
something
before
you
go?
You
mentioned
that
we
enter
an
account
number?"
The
man
