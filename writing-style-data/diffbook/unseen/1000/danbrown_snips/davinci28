stairwell,
and
Sophie
carefully
pulled
open
the
door.
No
alarm
sounded.
Only
the
doors
to
the
outside
were
wired.
Sophie
led
Langdon
down
a
tight
set
of
switchback
stairs
toward
the
ground
level,
picking
up
speed
as
they
went.
"Your
grandfather,"
Langdon
said,
hurrying
behind
her,
"when
he
told
you
about
the
pentacle,
did
he
mention
goddess
worship
or
any
resentment
of
the
Catholic
Church?"
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"I
was
more
interested
in
the
mathematics
of
it
the
Divine
Proportion,
PHI,
Fibonacci
sequences,
that
sort
of
thing."
Langdon
was
surprised.
"Your
grandfather
taught
you
about
the
number
PHI?"
"Of
course.
The
Divine
Proportion."
Her
expression
turned
sheepish.
"In
fact,
he
used
to
joke
that
I
was
half
divine
you
know,
because
of
the
letters
in
my
name."
Langdon
considered
it
a
moment
and
then
groaned.
s
o
PHI
e.
Still
descending,
Langdon
refocused
on
PHI.
He
was
starting
to
realize
that
Sauniere's
clues
were
even
more
consistent
than
he
had
first
imagined.
Da
Vinci
Fibonacci
numbers
the
pentacle.
Incredibly,
all
of
these
things
were
connected
by
a
single
concept
so
fundamental
to
art
history
that
Langdon
often
spent
several
class
periods
on
the
topic.
PHI.
He
felt
himself
suddenly
reeling
back
to
Harvard,
standing
in
front
of
his
"Symbolism
in
Art"
class,
writing
his
favorite
number
on
the
chalkboard.
1.618
Langdon
turned
to
face
his
sea
of
eager
students.
"Who
can
tell
me
what
this
number
is?"
A
long
legged
math
major
in
back
raised
his
hand.
"That's
the
number
PHI."
He
pronounced
it
fee.
"Nice
job,
Stettner,"
Langdon
said.
"Everyone,
meet
PHI."
"Not
to
be
confused
with
PI,"
Stettner
added,
grinning.
"As
we
mathematicians
like
to
say:
PHI
is
one
H
of
a
lot
cooler
than
PI
!
Langdon
laughed,
but
nobody
else
seemed
to
get
the
joke.
Stettner
slumped.
"This
number
PHI,"
Langdon
continued,
"one
point
six
one
eight,
is
a
very
important
number
in
art.
Who
can
tell
me
why?"
Stettner
tried
to
redeem
himself.
"Because
it's
so
pretty?"
Everyone
laughed.
"Actually,"
Langdon
said,
"Stettner's
right
again.
PHI
is
generally
considered
the
most
beautiful
number
in
the
universe."
The
laughter
abruptly
stopped,
and
Stettner
gloated.
As
Langdon
loaded
his
slide
projector,
he
explained
that
the
number
PHI
was
derived
from
the
Fibonacci
sequence
a
progression
famous
not
only
because
the
sum
of
adjacent
terms
equaled
the
next
term,
but
because
the
quotients
of
adjacent
terms
possessed
the
astonishing
property
of
approaching
the
number
1.618
PHI!
Despite
PHI's
seemingly
mystical
mathematical
origins,
Langdon
explained,
the
truly
mind
boggling
aspect
of
PHI
was
its
role
as
a
fundamental
building
block
in
nature.
Plants,
animals,
and
even
human
beings
all
possessed
dimensional
properties
that
adhered
with
eerie
exactitude
to
the
ratio
of
PHI
to
1.
"PHI's
ubiquity
in
nature,"
Langdon
said,
killing
the
lights,
"clearly
exceeds
coincidence,
and
so
the
ancients
assumed
the
number
PHI
must
have
been
preordained
by
the
Creator
of
the
universe.
Early
scientists
heralded
one
point
six
one
eight
as
the
Divine
Proportion.
"Hold
on,"
said
a
young
woman
in
the
front
row.
"I'm
a
bio
major
and
I've
never
seen
this
Divine
Proportion
in
nature."
"No?"
Langdon
grinned.
"Ever
study
the
relationship
between
females
and
males
in
a
honeybee
community?"
"Sure.
The
female
bees
always
outnumber
the
male
bees."
"Correct.
And
did
you
know
that
if
you
divide
the
number
of
female
bees
by
the
number
of
male
bees
in
any
beehive
in
the
world,
you
always
get
the
same
number?"
"You
do?"
"Yup.
PHI."
The
girl
gaped.
"NO
WAY!"
"Way!"
Langdon
fired
back,
smiling
as
he
projected
a
slide
of
a
spiral
seashell.
"Recognize
this?"
"It's
a
nautilus,"
the
bio
major
said.
"A
cephalopod
mollusk
that
pumps
gas
into
its
chambered
shell
to
adjust
its
buoyancy."
"Correct.
And
can
you
guess
what
the
ratio
is
of
each
spiral's
diameter
to
the
next?"
The
girl
looked
uncertain
as
she
eyed
the
concentric
arcs
of
the
nautilus
spiral.
Langdon
nodded.
"PHI.
The
Divine
Proportion.
One
point
six
one
eight
to
one."
The
girl
looked
amazed.
Langdon
advanced
to
the
next
slide
a
close
up
of
a
sunflower's
seed
head.
"Sunflower
seeds
grow
in
opposing
spirals.
Can
you
guess
the
ratio
of
each
rotation's
diameter
to
the
next?"
"PHI?"
everyone
said.
"Bingo."
Langdon
began
racing
through
slides
now
spiraled
pinecone
petals,
leaf
arrangement
on
plant
stalks,
insect
segmentation
all
displaying
astonishing
obedience
to
the
Divine
Proportion.
"This
is
amazing!"
someone
cried
out.
"Yeah,"
someone
else
said,
"but
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
art?"
"Aha!"
Langdon
said.
"Glad
you
asked."
He
pulled
up
another
slide
a
pale
yellow
parchment
displaying
Leonardo
da
Vinci's
famous
male
nude
The
Vitruvian
Man
named
for
Marcus
Vitruvius,
the
brilliant
Roman
architect
who
praised
the
Divine
Proportion
in
his
text
De
Architectura.
"Nobody
understood
better
than
Da
Vinci
the
divine
structure
of
the
human
body.
Da
Vinci
actually
exhumed
corpses
to
measure
the
exact
proportions
of
human
bone
structure.
He
was
the
first
to
show
that
the
human
body
is
literally
made
of
building
blocks
whose
proportional
ratios
always
equal
PHI."
Everyone
in
class
gave
him
a
dubious
look.
"Don't
believe
me?"
Langdon
challenged.
"Next
time
you're
in
the
shower,
take
a
tape
measure."
A
couple
of
football
players
snickered.
"Not
just
you
insecure
jocks,"
Langdon
prompted.
"All
of
you.
Guys
and
girls.
Try
it.
Measure
the
distance
from
the
tip
of
your
head
to
the
floor.
Then
divide
that
by
the
distance
from
your
belly
button
to
the
floor.
Guess
what
number
you
get."
"Not
PHI!"
one
of
the
jocks
blurted
out
in
disbelief.
"Yes,
PHI,"
Langdon
replied.
"One
point
six
one
eight.
Want
another
example?
Measure
the
distance
from
your
shoulder
to
your
fingertips,
and
then
divide
it
by
the
distance
from
your
elbow
to
your
fingertips.
PHI
again.
Another?
Hip
to
floor
divided
by
knee
to
floor.
PHI
again.
Finger
joints.
Toes.
Spinal
divisions.
PHI.
PHI.
PHI.
My
friends,
each
of
you
is
a
walking
tribute
to
the
Divine
Proportion.
Even
in
the
darkness,
Langdon
could
see
