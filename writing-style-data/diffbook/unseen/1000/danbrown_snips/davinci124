They
were
standing
in
an
enormous
dead
end.
The
creaking
of
a
heavy
door
behind
them
made
them
turn,
just
as
the
door
closed
with
a
resounding
thud
and
the
latch
fell
into
place.
The
lone
man
who
had
been
standing
behind
the
door
looked
calm
as
he
aimed
a
small
revolver
at
them.
He
was
portly
and
was
propped
on
a
pair
of
aluminum
crutches.
For
a
moment
Langdon
thought
he
must
be
dreaming.
It
was
Leigh
Teabing.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
felt
rueful
as
he
gazed
out
over
the
barrel
of
his
Medusa
revolver
at
Robert
Langdon
and
Sophie
Neveu.
"My
friends,"
he
said,
"since
the
moment
you
walked
into
my
home
last
night,
I
have
done
everything
in
my
power
to
keep
you
out
of
harm's
way.
But
your
persistence
has
now
put
me
in
a
difficult
position."
He
could
see
the
expressions
of
shock
and
betrayal
on
Sophie's
and
Langdon's
faces,
and
yet
he
was
confident
that
soon
they
would
both
understand
the
chain
of
events
that
had
guided
the
three
of
them
to
this
unlikely
crossroads.
There
is
so
much
I
have
to
tell
you
both
so
much
you
do
not
yet
understand.
"Please
believe,"
Teabing
said,
"I
never
had
any
intention
of
your
being
involved.
You
came
to
my
home.
You
came
searching
for
me.
"Leigh?"
Langdon
finally
managed.
"What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
We
thought
you
were
in
trouble.
We
came
here
to
help
you!"
"As
I
trusted
you
would,"
he
said.
"We
have
much
to
discuss."
Langdon
and
Sophie
seemed
unable
to
tear
their
stunned
gazes
from
the
revolver
aimed
at
them.
"It
is
simply
to
ensure
your
full
attention,"
Teabing
said.
"If
I
had
wanted
to
harm
you,
you
would
be
dead
by
now.
When
you
walked
into
my
home
last
night,
I
risked
everything
to
spare
your
lives.
I
am
a
man
of
honor,
and
I
vowed
in
my
deepest
conscience
only
to
sacrifice
those
who
had
betrayed
the
Sangreal."
"What
are
you
talking
about?"
Langdon
said.
"Betrayed
the
Sangreal?"
"I
discovered
a
terrible
truth,"
Teabing
said,
sighing.
"I
learned
why
the
Sangreal
documents
were
never
revealed
to
the
world.
I
learned
that
the
Priory
had
decided
not
to
release
the
truth
after
all.
That's
why
the
millennium
passed
without
any
revelation,
why
nothing
happened
as
we
entered
the
End
of
Days."
Langdon
drew
a
breath,
about
to
protest.
"The
Priory,"
Teabing
continued,
"was
given
a
sacred
charge
to
share
the
truth.
To
release
the
Sangreal
documents
when
the
End
of
Days
arrived.
For
centuries,
men
like
Da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
and
Newton
risked
everything
to
protect
the
documents
and
carry
out
that
charge.
And
now,
at
the
ultimate
moment
of
truth,
Jacques
Sauniere
changed
his
mind.
The
man
honored
with
the
greatest
responsibility
in
Christian
history
eschewed
his
duty.
He
decided
the
time
was
not
right."
Teabing
turned
to
Sophie.
"He
failed
the
Grail.
He
failed
the
Priory.
And
he
failed
the
memory
of
all
the
generations
that
had
worked
to
make
that
moment
possible."
"You?"
Sophie
declared,
glancing
up
now,
her
green
eyes
boring
into
him
with
rage
and
realization.
"You
are
the
one
responsible
for
my
grandfather's
murder?"
Teabing
scoffed.
"Your
grandfather
and
his
senechaux
were
traitors
to
the
Grail."
Sophie
felt
a
fury
rising
from
deep
within.
He's
lying!
Teabing's
voice
was
relentless.
"Your
grandfather
sold
out
to
the
Church.
It
is
obvious
they
pressured
him
to
keep
the
truth
quiet."
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"The
Church
had
no
influence
on
my
grandfather!"
Teabing
laughed
coldly.
"My
dear,
the
Church
has
two
thousand
years
of
experience
pressuring
those
who
threaten
to
unveil
its
lies.
Since
the
days
of
Constantine,
the
Church
has
successfully
hidden
the
truth
about
Mary
Magdalene
and
Jesus.
We
should
not
be
surprised
that
now,
once
again,
they
have
found
a
way
to
keep
the
world
in
the
dark.
The
Church
may
no
longer
employ
crusaders
to
slaughter
non
believers,
but
their
influence
is
no
less
persuasive.
No
less
insidious."
He
paused,
as
if
to
punctuate
his
next
point.
"Miss
Neveu,
for
some
time
now
your
grandfather
has
wanted
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
family."
Sophie
was
stunned.
"How
could
you
know
that?"
"My
methods
are
immaterial.
The
important
thing
for
you
to
grasp
right
now
is
this."
He
took
a
deep
breath.
"The
deaths
of
your
mother,
father,
grandmother,
and
brother
were
not
accidental."
The
words
sent
Sophie's
emotions
reeling.
She
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
but
was
unable.
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"What
are
you
saying?"
"Robert,
it
explains
everything.
All
the
pieces
fit.
History
repeats
itself.
The
Church
has
a
precedent
of
murder
when
it
comes
to
silencing
the
Sangreal.
With
the
End
of
Days
imminent,
killing
the
Grand
Master's
loved
ones
sent
a
very
clear
message.
Be
quiet,
or
you
and
Sophie
are
next."
"It
was
a
car
accident,"
Sophie
stammered,
feeling
the
childhood
pain
welling
inside
her.
"An
accident!"
"Bedtime
stories
to
protect
your
innocence,"
Teabing
said.
"Consider
that
only
two
family
members
went
untouched
the
Priory's
Grand
Master
and
his
lone
granddaughter
the
perfect
pair
to
provide
the
Church
with
control
over
the
brotherhood.
I
can
only
imagine
the
terror
the
Church
wielded
over
your
grandfather
these
past
years,
threatening
to
kill
you
if
he
dared
release
the
Sangreal
secret,
threatening
to
finish
the
job
they
started
unless
Sauniere
influenced
the
Priory
to
reconsider
its
ancient
vow."
"Leigh,"
Langdon
argued,
now
visibly
riled,
"certainly
you
have
no
proof
that
the
Church
had
anything
to
do
with
those
deaths,
or
that
it
influenced
the
Priory's
decision
to
remain
silent."
"Proof?"
Teabing
fired
back.
"You
want
proof
the
Priory
was
influenced?
The
new
millennium
has
arrived,
and
yet
the
world
remains
ignorant!
Is
that
not
proof
enough?"
In
the
echoes
of
Teabing's
words,
Sophie
heard
another
voice
speaking.
Sophie,
I
must
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
family.
She
realized
she
was
trembling.
Could
this
possibly
be
that
truth
her
grandfather
had
wanted
to
tell
her?
That
her
