surprising
we
feel
conflicted
about
sex?"
he
asked
his
students.
"Our
ancient
heritage
and
our
very
physiologies
tell
us
sex
is
natural
a
cherished
route
to
spiritual
fulfillment
and
yet
modern
religion
decries
it
as
shameful,
teaching
us
to
fear
our
sexual
desire
as
the
hand
of
the
devil."
Langdon
decided
not
to
shock
his
students
with
the
fact
that
more
than
a
dozen
secret
societies
around
the
world
many
of
them
quite
influential
still
practiced
sex
rites
and
kept
the
ancient
traditions
alive.
Tom
Cruise's
character
in
the
film
Eyes
Wide
Shut
discovered
this
the
hard
way
when
he
sneaked
into
a
private
gathering
of
ultraelite
Manhattanites
only
to
find
himself
witnessing
Hieros
Gamos.
Sadly,
the
filmmakers
had
gotten
most
of
the
specifics
wrong,
but
the
basic
gist
was
there
a
secret
society
communing
to
celebrate
the
magic
of
sexual
union.
"Professor
Langdon?"
A
male
student
in
back
raised
his
hand,
sounding
hopeful.
"Are
you
saying
that
instead
of
going
to
chapel,
we
should
have
more
sex?"
Langdon
chuckled,
not
about
to
take
the
bait.
From
what
he'd
heard
about
Harvard
parties,
these
kids
were
having
more
than
enough
sex.
"Gentlemen,"
he
said,
knowing
he
was
on
tender
ground,
"might
I
offer
a
suggestion
for
all
of
you.
Without
being
so
bold
as
to
condone
premarital
sex,
and
without
being
so
naive
as
to
think
you're
all
chaste
angels,
I
will
give
you
this
bit
of
advice
about
your
sex
lives."
All
the
men
in
the
audience
leaned
forward,
listening
intently.
"The
next
time
you
find
yourself
with
a
woman,
look
in
your
heart
and
see
if
you
cannot
approach
sex
as
a
mystical,
spiritual
act.
Challenge
yourself
to
find
that
spark
of
divinity
that
man
can
only
achieve
through
union
with
the
sacred
feminine."
The
women
smiled
knowingly,
nodding.
The
men
exchanged
dubious
giggles
and
off
color
jokes.
Langdon
sighed.
College
men
were
still
boys.
Sophie's
forehead
felt
cold
as
she
pressed
it
against
the
plane's
window
and
stared
blankly
into
the
void,
trying
to
process
what
Langdon
had
just
told
her.
She
felt
a
new
regret
well
within
her.
Ten
years.
She
pictured
the
stacks
of
unopened
letters
her
grandfather
had
sent
her.
will
tell
Robert
everything.
Without
turning
from
the
window,
Sophie
began
to
speak.
Quietly.
Fearfully.
As
she
began
to
recount
what
had
happened
that
night,
she
felt
herself
drifting
back
alighting
in
the
woods
outside
her
grandfather's
Normandy
chateau
searching
the
deserted
house
in
confusion
hearing
the
voices
below
her
and
then
finding
the
hidden
door.
She
inched
down
the
stone
staircase,
one
step
at
a
time,
into
that
basement
grotto.
She
could
taste
the
earthy
air.
Cool
and
light.
It
was
March.
In
the
shadows
of
her
hiding
place
on
the
staircase,
she
watched
as
the
strangers
swayed
and
chanted
by
flickering
orange
candles.
I'm
dreaming,
Sophie
told
herself.
This
is
a
dream.
What
else
could
this
be?
The
women
and
men
were
staggered,
black,
white,
black,
white.
The
women's
beautiful
gossamer
gowns
billowed
as
they
raised
in
their
right
hands
golden
orbs
and
called
out
in
unison,
'7
was
with
you
in
the
beginning,
in
the
dawn
of
all
that
is
holy,
I
bore
you
from
the
womb
before
the
start
of
day."
The
women
lowered
their
orbs,
and
everyone
rocked
back
and
forth
as
if
in
a
trance.
They
were
revering
something
in
the
center
of
the
circle.
What
are
they
looking
at?
The
voices
accelerated
now.
Louder.
Faster.
"The
woman
whom
you
behold
is
love!"
The
women
called,
raising
their
orbs
again.
The
men
responded,
"She
has
her
dwelling
in
eternity!
The
chanting
grew
steady
again.
Accelerating.
Thundering
now.
Faster.
The
participants
stepped
inward
and
knelt.
In
that
instant,
Sophie
could
finally
see
what
they
were
all
watching.
On
a
low,
ornate
altar
in
the
center
of
the
circle
lay
a
man.
He
was
naked,
positioned
on
his
back,
and
wearing
a
black
mask.
Sophie
instantly
recognized
his
body
and
the
birthmark
on
his
shoulder.
She
almost
cried
out.
Grand
pere!
This
image
alone
would
have
shocked
Sophie
beyond
belief,
and
yet
there
was
more.
Straddling
her
grandfather
was
a
naked
woman
wearing
a
white
mask,
her
luxuriant
silver
hair
flowing
out
behind
it.
Her
body
was
plump,
far
from
perfect,
and
she
was
gyrating
in
rhythm
to
the
chanting
making
love
to
Sophie's
grandfather.
Sophie
wanted
to
turn
and
run,
but
she
couldn't.
The
stone
walls
of
the
grotto
imprisoned
her
as
the
chanting
rose
to
a
fever
pitch.
The
circle
of
participants
seemed
almost
to
be
singing
now,
the
noise
rising
in
crescendo
to
a
frenzy.
With
a
sudden
roar,
the
entire
room
seemed
to
erupt
in
climax.
Sophie
could
not
breathe.
She
suddenly
realized
she
was
quietly
sobbing.
She
turned
and
staggered
silently
up
the
stairs,
out
of
the
house,
and
drove
trembling
back
to
Paris.
The
chartered
turboprop
was
just
passing
over
the
twinkling
lights
of
Monaco
when
Aringarosa
hung
up
on
Fache
for
the
second
time.
He
reached
for
the
airsickness
bag
again
but
felt
too
drained
even
to
be
sick.
Just
let
it
be
over!
Fache's
newest
update
seemed
unfathomable,
and
yet
almost
nothing
tonight
made
sense
anymore.
What
is
going
on
?
Everything
had
spiraled
wildly
out
of
control.
What
have
I
gotten
Silas
into
?
What
have
I
gotten
myself
into!
On
shaky
legs,
Aringarosa
walked
to
the
cockpit.
"I
need
to
change
destinations."
The
pilot
glanced
over
his
shoulder
and
laughed.
"You're
joking,
right?"
"No.
I
have
to
get
to
London
immediately."
"Father,
this
is
a
charter
flight,
not
a
taxi."
"I
will
pay
you
extra,
of
course.
How
much?
London
is
only
one
hour
farther
north
and
requires
almost
no
change
of
direction,
so
"It's
not
a
question
of
money,
Father,
there
are
other
issues."
"Ten
thousand
euro.
Right
now."
The
pilot
turned,
his
eyes
wide
with
shock.
"How
much?
What
kind
of
priest
carries
that
kind
of
cash?"
Aringarosa
walked
back
to
his
black
briefcase,
opened
it,
and
removed
