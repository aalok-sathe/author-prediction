has
recently
passed,
and
with
it
has
ended
the
two
thousand
year
long
astrological
Age
of
Pisces
the
fish,
which
is
also
the
sign
of
Jesus.
As
any
astrological
symbologist
will
tell
you,
the
Piscean
ideal
believes
that
man
must
be
told
what
to
do
by
higher
powers
because
man
is
incapable
of
thinking
for
himself.
Hence
it
has
been
a
time
of
fervent
religion.
Now,
however,
we
are
entering
the
Age
of
Aquarius
the
water
bearer
whose
ideals
claim
that
man
will
learn
the
truth
and
be
able
to
think
for
himself.
The
ideological
shift
is
enormous,
and
it
is
occurring
right
now."
Langdon
felt
a
shiver.
Astrological
prophecy
never
held
much
interest
or
credibility
for
him,
but
he
knew
there
were
those
in
the
Church
who
followed
it
very
closely.
"The
Church
calls
this
transitional
period
the
End
of
Days."
Sophie
looked
skeptical.
"As
in
the
end
of
the
world?
The
Apocalypse?"
"No."
Langdon
replied.
"That's
a
common
misconception.
Many
religions
speak
of
the
End
of
Days.
It
refers
not
to
the
end
of
the
world,
but
rather
the
end
of
our
current
age
Pisces,
which
began
at
the
time
of
Christ's
birth,
spanned
two
thousand
years,
and
waned
with
the
passing
of
the
millennium.
Now
that
we've
passed
into
the
Age
of
Aquarius,
the
End
of
Days
has
arrived."
"Many
Grail
historians,"
Teabing
added,
"believe
that
"the
Priory
is
indeed
planning
to
release
this
truth,
this
point
in
history
would
be
a
symbolically
apt
time.
Most
Priory
academics,
myself
included,
anticipated
the
brotherhood's
release
would
coincide
precisely
with
the
millennium.
Obviously,
it
did
not.
Admittedly,
the
Roman
calendar
does
not
mesh
perfectly
with
astrological
markers,
so
there
is
some
gray
area
in
the
prediction.
Whether
the
Church
now
has
inside
information
that
an
exact
date
is
looming,
or
whether
they
are
just
getting
nervous
on
account
of
astrological
prophecy,
I
don't
know.
Anyway,
it's
immaterial.
Either
scenario
explains
how
the
Church
might
be
motivated
to
launch
a
preemptive
attack
against
the
Priory."
Teabing
frowned.
"And
believe
me,
if
the
Church
finds
the
Holy
Grail,
they
will
destroy
it.
The
documents
and
the
relics
of
the
blessed
Mary
Magdalene
as
well."
His
eyes
grew
heavy.
"Then,
my
dear,
with
the
Sangreal
documents
gone,
all
evidence
will
be
lost.
The
Church
will
have
won
their
age
old
war
to
rewrite
history.
The
past
will
be
erased
forever."
Slowly,
Sophie
pulled
the
cruciform
key
from
her
sweater
pocket
and
held
it
out
to
Teabing.
Teabing
took
the
key
and
studied
it.
"My
goodness.
The
Priory
seal.
Where
did
you
get
this?"
"My
grandfather
gave
it
to
me
tonight
before
he
died."
Teabing
ran
his
fingers
across
the
cruciform.
"A
key
to
a
church?"
She
drew
a
deep
breath.
"This
key
provides
access
to
the
keystone."
Teabing's
head
snapped
up,
his
face
wild
with
disbelief.
"Impossible!
What
church
did
I
miss?
I've
searched
every
church
in
France!"
"It's
not
in
a
church,"
Sophie
said.
"It's
in
a
Swiss
depository
bank."
Teabing's
look
of
excitement
waned.
"The
keystone
is
in
a
bank?"
"A
vault,"
Langdon
offered.
"A
bank
vault?"
Teabing
shook
his
head
violently.
"That's
impossible.
The
keystone
is
supposed
to
be
hidden
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose."
"It
is,"
Langdon
said.
"It
was
stored
in
a
rosewood
box
inlaid
with
a
five
petal
Rose."
Teabing
looked
thunderstruck.
"You've
seen
the
keystone?"
Sophie
nodded.
"We
visited
the
bank."
Teabing
came
over
to
them,
his
eyes
wild
with
fear.
"My
friends,
we
must
do
something.
The
keystone
is
in
danger!
We
have
a
duty
to
protect
it.
What
if
there
are
other
keys?
Perhaps
stolen
from
the
murdered
senechaux?
If
the
Church
can
gain
access
to
the
bank
as
you
have
"Then
they
will
be
too
late,"
Sophie
said.
"We
removed
the
keystone."
"What!
You
removed
the
keystone
from
its
hiding
place?"
"Don't
worry,"
Langdon
said.
"The
keystone
is
well
hidden."
"Extremely
well
hidden,
I
hope
!
"Actually,"
Langdon
said,
unable
to
hide
his
grin,
"that
depends
on
how
often
you
dust
under
your
couch."
The
wind
outside
Chateau
Villette
had
picked
up,
and
Silas's
robe
danced
in
the
breeze
as
he
crouched
near
the
window.
Although
he
had
been
unable
to
hear
much
of
the
conversation,
the
word
keystone
had
sifted
through
the
glass
on
numerous
occasions.
It
is
inside.
The
Teacher's
words
were
fresh
in
his
mind.
Enter
Chateau
Villette.
Take
the
keystone.
Hun
no
one.
Now,
Langdon
and
the
others
had
adjourned
suddenly
to
another
room,
extinguishing
the
study
lights
as
they
went.
Feeling
like
a
panther
stalking
prey,
Silas
crept
to
the
glass
doors.
Finding
them
unlocked,
he
slipped
inside
and
closed
the
doors
silently
behind
him.
He
could
hear
muffled
voices
from
another
room.
Silas
pulled
the
pistol
from
his
pocket,
turned
off
the
safety,
and
inched
down
the
hallway.
Lieutenant
Collet
stood
alone
at
the
foot
of
Leigh
Teabing's
driveway
and
gazed
up
at
the
massive
house.
Isolated.
Dark.
Good
ground
cover.
Collet
watched
his
half
dozen
agents
spreading
silently
out
along
the
length
of
the
fence.
They
could
be
over
it
and
have
the
house
surrounded
in
a
matter
of
minutes.
Langdon
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
ideal
spot
for
Collet's
men
to
make
a
surprise
assault.
Collet
was
about
to
call
Fache
himself
when
at
last
his
phone
rang.
Fache
sounded
not
nearly
as
pleased
with
the
developments
as
Collet
would
have
imagined.
"Why
didn't
someone
tell
me
we
had
a
lead
on
Langdon?"
"You
were
on
a
phone
call
and
"Where
exactly
are
you,
Lieutenant
Collet?"
Collet
gave
him
the
address.
"The
estate
belongs
to
a
British
national
named
Teabing.
Langdon
drove
a
fair
distance
to
get
here,
and
the
vehicle
is
inside
the
security
gate,
with
no
signs
of
forced
entry,
so
chances
are
good
that
Langdon
knows
the
occupant."
"I'm
coming
out,"
Fache
said.
"Don't
make
a
move.
I'll
handle
this
personally."
Collet's
jaw
dropped.
"But
Captain,
you're
twenty
minutes
away!
We
should
act
immediately.
I
have
him
staked
out.
