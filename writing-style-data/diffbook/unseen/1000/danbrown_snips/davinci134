you
remember
earlier
that
I
mentioned
Rosslyn
itself
is
a
copy
of
Solomon's
Temple?
Those
two
pillars
are
exact
replicas
of
the
two
pillars
that
stood
at
the
head
of
Solomon's
Temple."
Langdon
pointed
to
the
pillar
on
the
left.
"That's
called
Boaz
or
the
Mason's
Pillar.
The
other
is
called
Jachin
or
the
Apprentice
Pillar."
He
paused.
"In
fact,
virtually
every
Masonic
temple
in
the
world
has
two
pillars
like
these."
Langdon
had
already
explained
to
her
about
the
Templars'
powerful
historic
ties
to
the
modern
Masonic
secret
societies,
whose
primary
degrees
Apprentice
Freemason,
Fellowcraft
Freemason,
and
Master
Mason
harked
back
to
early
Templar
days.
Sophie's
grandfather's
final
verse
made
direct
reference
to
the
Master
Masons
who
adorned
Rosslyn
with
their
carved
artistic
offerings.
It
also
noted
Rosslyn's
central
ceiling,
which
was
covered
with
carvings
of
stars
and
planets.
"I've
never
been
in
a
Masonic
temple,"
Sophie
said,
still
eyeing
the
pillars.
"I
am
almost
positive
I
saw
these
here.
"
She
turned
back
into
the
chapel,
as
if
looking
for
something
else
to
jog
her
memory.
The
rest
of
the
visitors
were
now
leaving,
and
the
young
docent
made
his
way
across
the
chapel
to
them
with
a
pleasant
smile.
He
was
a
handsome
young
man
in
his
late
twenties,
with
a
Scottish
brogue
and
strawberry
blond
hair.
"I'm
about
to
close
up
for
the
day.
May
I
help
you
find
anything?"
How
about
the
Holy
Grail?
Langdon
wanted
to
say.
"The
code,"
Sophie
blurted,
in
sudden
revelation.
"There's
a
code
here!"
The
docent
looked
pleased
by
her
enthusiasm.
"Yes
there
is,
ma'am."
"It's
on
the
ceiling,"
she
said,
turning
to
the
right
hand
wall.
"Somewhere
over
there."
He
smiled.
"Not
your
first
visit
to
Rosslyn,
I
see."
The
code,
Langdon
thought.
He
had
forgotten
that
little
bit
of
lore.
Among
Rosslyn's
numerous
mysteries
was
a
vaulted
archway
from
which
hundreds
of
stone
blocks
protruded,
jutting
down
to
form
a
bizarre
multifaceted
surface.
Each
block
was
carved
with
a
symbol,
seemingly
at
random,
creating
a
cipher
of
unfathomable
proportion.
Some
people
believed
the
code
revealed
the
entrance
to
the
vault
beneath
the
chapel.
Others
believed
it
told
the
true
Grail
legend.
Not
that
it
mattered
cryptographers
had
been
trying
for
centuries
to
decipher
its
meaning.
To
this
day
the
Rosslyn
Trust
offered
a
generous
reward
to
anyone
who
could
unveil
the
secret
meaning,
but
the
code
remained
a
mystery.
"I'd
be
happy
to
show"
The
docent's
voice
trailed
off.
My
first
code,
Sophie
thought,
moving
alone,
in
a
trance,
toward
the
encoded
archway.
Having
handed
the
rosewood
box
to
Langdon,
she
could
feel
herself
momentarily
forgetting
all
about
the
Holy
Grail,
the
Priory
of
Sion,
and
all
the
mysteries
of
the
past
day.
When
she
arrived
beneath
the
encoded
ceiling
and
saw
the
symbols
above
her,
the
memories
came
flooding
back.
She
was
recalling
her
first
visit
here,
and
strangely,
the
memories
conjured
an
unexpected
sadness.
She
was
a
little
girl
a
year
or
so
after
her
family's
death.
Her
grandfather
had
brought
her
to
Scotland
on
a
short
vacation.
They
had
come
to
see
Rosslyn
Chapel
before
going
back
to
Paris.
It
was
late
evening,
and
the
chapel
was
closed.
But
they
were
still
inside.
"Can
we
go
home,
Grand
pere?"
Sophie
begged,
feeling
tired.
"Soon,
dear,
very
soon."
His
voice
was
melancholy.
"I
have
one
last
thing
I
need
to
do
here.
How
about
if
you
wait
in
the
car?"
"You're
doing
another
big
person
thing?"
He
nodded.
"I'll
be
fast.
I
promise."
"Can
I
do
the
archway
code
again?
That
was
fun."
"I
don't
know.
I
have
to
step
outside.
You
won't
be
frightened
in
here
alone?"
"Of
course
not!"
she
said
with
a
huff.
"It's
not
even
dark
yet!"
He
smiled.
"Very
well
then.
"
He
led
her
over
to
the
elaborate
archway
he
had
shown
her
earlier.
Sophie
immediately
plopped
down
on
the
stone
floor,
lying
on
her
back
and
staring
up
at
the
collage
of
puzzle
pieces
overhead.
"I'm
going
to
break
this
code
before
you
get
back!"
"It's
a
race
then."
He
bent
over,
kissed
her
forehead,
and
walked
to
the
nearby
side
door.
"I'll
be
right
outside.
I'll
leave
the
door
open.
If
you
need
me,
just
call."
He
exited
into
the
soft
evening
light.
Sophie
lay
there
on
the
floor,
gazing
up
at
the
code.
Her
eyes
felt
sleepy.
After
a
few
minutes,
the
symbols
got
fuzzy.
And
then
they
disappeared.
When
Sophie
awoke,
the
floor
felt
cold.
"Grand
pere?"
There
was
no
answer.
Standing
up,
she
brushed
herself
off.
The
side
door
was
still
open.
The
evening
was
getting
darker.
She
walked
outside
and
could
see
her
grandfather
standing
on
the
porch
of
a
nearby
stone
house
directly
behind
the
church.
Her
grandfather
was
talking
quietly
to
a
person
barely
visible
inside
the
screened
door.
"Grand
pere
?
"
she
called.
Her
grandfather
turned
and
waved,
motioning
for
her
to
wait
just
a
moment.
Then,
slowly,
he
said
some
final
words
to
the
person
inside
and
blew
a
kiss
toward
the
screened
door.
He
came
to
her
with
tearful
eyes.
"Why
are
you
crying,
Grand
pere?"
He
picked
her
up
and
held
her
close.
"Oh,
Sophie,
you
and
I
have
said
good
bye
to
a
lot
of
people
this
year.
It's
hard."
Sophie
thought
of
the
accident,
of
saying
good
bye
to
her
mother
and
father,
her
grandmother
and
baby
brother.
"Were
you
saying
goodbye
to
another
person?"
"To
a
dear
friend
whom
I
love
very
much,"
he
replied,
his
voice
heavy
with
emotion.
"And
I
fear
I
will
not
see
her
again
for
a
very
long
time."
Standing
with
the
docent,
Langdon
had
been
scanning
the
chapel
walls
and
feeling
a
rising
wariness
that
a
dead
end
might
be
looming.
Sophie
had
wandered
off
to
look
at
the
code
and
left
Langdon
holding
the
rosewood
box,
which
contained
a
Grail
map
that
now
appeared
to
be
no
help
at
all.
Although
Sauniere's
poem
clearly
indicated
Rosslyn,
Langdon
