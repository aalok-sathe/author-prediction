calling
Interpol."
Collet
looked
surprised.
"You're
putting
this
on
the
wire?"
Fache
regretted
the
potential
embarrassment,
but
he
saw
no
other
choice.
Close
the
net
fast,
and
close
it
tight.
The
first
hour
was
critical.
Fugitives
were
predictable
the
first
hour
after
escape.
They
always
needed
the
same
thing.
Travel.
Lodging.
Cash.
The
Holy
Trinity.
Interpol
had
the
power
to
make
all
three
disappear
in
the
blink
of
an
eye.
By
broadcast
faxing
photos
of
Langdon
and
Sophie
to
Paris
travel
authorities,
hotels,
and
banks,
Interpol
would
leave
no
options
no
way
to
leave
the
city,
no
place
to
hide,
and
no
way
to
withdraw
cash
without
being
recognized.
Usually,
fugitives
panicked
on
the
street
and
did
something
stupid.
Stole
a
car.
Robbed
a
store.
Used
a
bank
card
in
desperation.
Whatever
mistake
they
committed,
they
quickly
made
their
whereabouts
known
to
local
authorities.
"Only
Langdon,
right?"
Collet
said.
"You're
not
flagging
Sophie
Neveu.
She's
our
own
agent."
"Of
course
I'm
flagging
her!"
Fache
snapped.
"What
good
is
flagging
Langdon
if
she
can
do
all
his
dirty
work?
I
plan
to
run
Neveu's
employment
file
friends,
family,
personal
contacts
anyone
she
might
turn
to
for
help.
I
don't
know
what
she
thinks
she's
doing
out
there,
but
it's
going
to
cost
her
one
hell
of
a
lot
more
than
her
job!"
"Do
you
want
me
on
the
phones
or
in
the
field?"
"Field.
Get
over
to
the
train
station
and
coordinate
the
team.
You've
got
the
reins,
but
don't
make
a
move
without
talking
to
me."
"Yes,
sir."
Collet
ran
out.
Fache
felt
rigid
as
he
stood
in
the
alcove.
Outside
the
window,
the
glass
pyramid
shone,
its
reflection
rippling
in
the
windswept
pools.
They
slipped
through
my
fingers.
He
told
himself
to
relax.
Even
a
trained
field
agent
would
be
lucky
to
withstand
the
pressure
that
Interpol
was
about
to
apply.
A
female
cryptologist
and
a
schoolteacher?
They
wouldn't
last
till
dawn.
The
heavily
forested
park
known
as
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
was
called
many
things,
but
the
Parisian
cognoscenti
knew
it
as
"the
Garden
of
Earthly
Delights."
The
epithet,
despite
sounding
flattering,
was
quite
to
the
contrary.
Anyone
who
had
seen
the
lurid
Bosch
painting
of
the
same
name
understood
the
jab;
the
painting,
like
the
forest,
was
dark
and
twisted,
a
purgatory
for
freaks
and
fetishists.
At
night,
the
forest's
winding
lanes
were
lined
with
hundreds
of
glistening
bodies
for
hire,
earthly
delights
to
satisfy
one's
deepest
unspoken
desires
male,
female,
and
everything
in
between.
As
Langdon
gathered
his
thoughts
to
tell
Sophie
about
the
Priory
of
Sion,
their
taxi
passed
through
the
wooded
entrance
to
the
park
and
began
heading
west
on
the
cobblestone
crossfare.
Langdon
was
having
trouble
concentrating
as
a
scattering
of
the
park's
nocturnal
residents
were
already
emerging
from
the
shadows
and
flaunting
their
wares
in
the
glare
of
the
headlights.
Ahead,
two
topless
teenage
girls
shot
smoldering
gazes
into
the
taxi.
Beyond
them,
a
well
oiled
black
man
in
a
G
string
turned
and
flexed
his
buttocks.
Beside
him,
a
gorgeous
blond
woman
lifted
her
miniskirt
to
reveal
that
she
was
not,
in
fact,
a
woman.
Heaven
help
me!
Langdon
turned
his
gaze
back
inside
the
cab
and
took
a
deep
breath.
"Tell
me
about
the
Priory
of
Sion,"
Sophie
said.
Langdon
nodded,
unable
to
imagine
a
less
congruous
a
backdrop
for
the
legend
he
was
about
to
tell.
He
wondered
where
to
begin.
The
brotherhood's
history
spanned
more
than
a
millennium
an
astonishing
chronicle
of
secrets,
blackmail,
betrayal,
and
even
brutal
torture
at
the
hands
of
an
angry
Pope.
"The
Priory
of
Sion,"
he
began,
"was
founded
in
Jerusalem
in
1099
by
a
French
king
named
Godefroi
de
Bouillon,
immediately
after
he
had
conquered
the
city."
Sophie
nodded,
her
eyes
riveted
on
him.
"King
Godefroi
was
allegedly
the
possessor
of
a
powerful
secret
a
secret
that
had
been
in
his
family
since
the
time
of
Christ.
Fearing
his
secret
might
be
lost
when
he
died,
he
founded
a
secret
brotherhood
the
Priory
of
Sion
and
charged
them
with
protecting
his
secret
by
quietly
passing
it
on
from
generation
to
generation.
During
their
years
in
Jerusalem,
the
Priory
learned
of
a
stash
of
hidden
documents
buried
beneath
the
ruins
of
Herod's
temple,
which
had
been
built
atop
the
earlier
ruins
of
Solomon's
Temple.
These
documents,
they
believed,
corroborated
Godefroi's
powerful
secret
and
were
so
explosive
in
nature
that
the
Church
would
stop
at
nothing
to
get
them."
Sophie
looked
uncertain.
"The
Priory
vowed
that
no
matter
how
long
it
took,
these
documents
must
be
recovered
from
the
rubble
beneath
the
temple
and
protected
forever,
so
the
truth
would
never
die.
In
order
to
retrieve
the
documents
from
within
the
ruins,
the
Priory
created
a
military
arm
a
group
of
nine
knights
called
the
Order
of
the
Poor
Knights
of
Christ
and
the
Temple
of
Solomon."
Langdon
paused.
"More
commonly
known
as
the
Knights
Templar."
Sophie
glanced
up
with
a
surprised
look
of
recognition.
Langdon
had
lectured
often
enough
on
the
Knights
Templar
to
know
that
almost
everyone
on
earth
had
heard
of
them,
at
least
abstractedly.
For
academics,
the
Templars'
history
was
a
precarious
world
where
fact,
lore,
and
misinformation
had
become
so
intertwined
that
extracting
a
pristine
truth
was
almost
impossible.
Nowadays,
Langdon
hesitated
even
to
mention
the
Knights
Templar
while
lecturing
because
it
invariably
led
to
a
barrage
of
convoluted
inquiries
into
assorted
conspiracy
theories.
Sophie
already
looked
troubled.
"You're
saying
the
Knights
Templar
were
founded
by
the
Priory
of
Sion
to
retrieve
a
collection
of
secret
documents?
I
thought
the
Templars
were
created
to
protect
the
Holy
Land."
"A
common
misconception.
The
idea
of
protection
of
pilgrims
was
the
guise
under
which
the
Templars
ran
their
mission.
Their
true
goal
in
the
Holy
Land
was
to
retrieve
the
documents
from
beneath
the
ruins
of
the
temple."
"And
did
they
find
them?"
Langdon
grinned.
"Nobody
knows
for
sure,
but
the
one
thing
on
which
all
academics
agree
is
this:
The
