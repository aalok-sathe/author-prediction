left,
across
the
Seine,
the
illuminated
Eiffel
Tower.
Straight
ahead,
the
Arc
de
Triomphe.
And
to
the
right,
high
atop
the
sloping
rise
of
Montmartre,
the
graceful
arabesque
dome
of
Sacre
Coeur,
its
polished
stone
glowing
white
like
a
resplendent
sanctuary.
Here
at
the
westernmost
tip
of
the
Denon
Wing,
the
north
south
thoroughfare
of
Place
du
Carrousel
ran
almost
flush
with
the
building
with
only
a
narrow
sidewalk
separating
it
from
the
Louvre's
outer
wall.
Far
below,
the
usual
caravan
of
the
city's
nighttime
delivery
trucks
sat
idling,
waiting
for
the
signals
to
change,
their
running
lights
seeming
to
twinkle
mockingly
up
at
Sophie.
"I
don't
know
what
to
say,"
Langdon
said,
coming
up
behind
her.
"Your
grandfather
is
obviously
trying
to
tell
us
something.
I'm
sorry
I'm
so
little
help."
Sophie
turned
from
the
window,
sensing
a
sincere
regret
in
Langdon's
deep
voice.
Even
with
all
the
trouble
around
him,
he
obviously
wanted
to
help
her.
The
teacher
in
him,
she
thought,
having
read
DCPJ's
workup
on
their
suspect.
This
was
an
academic
who
clearly
despised
not
understanding.
We
have
that
in
common,
she
thought.
As
a
codebreaker,
Sophie
made
her
living
extracting
meaning
from
seemingly
senseless
data.
Tonight,
her
best
guess
was
that
Robert
Langdon,
whether
he
knew
it
or
not,
possessed
information
that
she
desperately
needed.
Princesse
Sophie,
Find
Robert
Langdon.
How
much
clearer
could
her
grandfather's
message
be?
Sophie
needed
more
time
with
Langdon.
Time
to
think.
Time
to
sort
out
this
mystery
together.
Unfortunately,
time
was
running
out.
Gazing
up
at
Langdon,
Sophie
made
the
only
play
she
could
think
of.
"Bezu
Fache
will
be
taking
you
into
custody
at
any
minute.
I
can
get
you
out
of
this
museum.
But
we
need
to
act
now."
Langdon's
eyes
went
wide.
"You
want
me
to
run?"
"It's
the
smartest
thing
you
could
do.
If
you
let
Fache
take
you
into
custody
now,
you'll
spend
weeks
in
a
French
jail
while
DCPJ
and
the
U.S.
Embassy
fight
over
which
courts
try
your
case.
But
if
we
get
you
out
of
here,
and
make
it
to
your
embassy,
then
your
government
will
protect
your
rights
while
you
and
I
prove
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
murder.
Langdon
looked
not
even
vaguely
convinced.
"Forget
it!
Fache
has
armed
guards
on
every
single
exit!
Even
if
we
escape
without
being
shot,
running
away
only
makes
me
look
guilty.
You
need
to
tell
Fache
that
the
message
on
the
floor
was
for
you,
and
that
my
name
is
not
there
as
an
accusation.
"I
will
do
that,"
Sophie
said,
speaking
hurriedly,
"but
after
you're
safely
inside
the
U.S.
Embassy.
It's
only
about
a
mile
from
here,
and
my
car
is
parked
just
outside
the
museum.
Dealing
with
Fache
from
here
is
too
much
of
a
gamble.
Don't
you
see?
Fache
has
made
it
his
mission
tonight
to
prove
you
are
guilty.
The
only
reason
he
postponed
your
arrest
was
to
run
this
observance
in
hopes
you
did
something
that
made
his
case
stronger."
"Exactly.
Like
running!"
The
cell
phone
in
Sophie's
sweater
pocket
suddenly
began
ringing.
Fache
probably.
She
reached
in
her
sweater
and
turned
off
the
phone.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
she
said
hurriedly,
"I
need
to
ask
you
one
last
question."
And
your
entire
future
may
depend
on
it.
"The
writing
on
the
floor
is
obviously
not
proof
of
your
guilt,
and
yet
Fache
told
our
team
he
is
certain
you
are
his
man.
Can
you
think
of
any
other
reason
he
might
be
convinced
you're
guilty?"
Langdon
was
silent
for
several
seconds.
"None
whatsoever."
Sophie
sighed.
Which
means
Fache
is
lying.
Why,
Sophie
could
not
begin
to
imagine,
but
that
was
hardly
the
issue
at
this
point.
The
fact
remained
that
Bezu
Fache
was
determined
to
put
Robert
Langdon
behind
bars
tonight,
at
any
cost.
Sophie
needed
Langdon
for
herself,
and
it
was
this
dilemma
that
left
Sophie
only
one
logical
conclusion.
need
to
get
Langdon
to
the
U.S.
Embassy.
Turning
toward
the
window,
Sophie
gazed
through
the
alarm
mesh
embedded
in
the
plate
glass,
down
the
dizzying
forty
feet
to
the
pavement
below.
A
leap
from
this
height
would
leave
Langdon
with
a
couple
of
broken
legs.
At
best.
Nonetheless,
Sophie
made
her
decision.
Robert
Langdon
was
about
to
escape
the
Louvre,
whether
he
wanted
to
or
not.
"What
do
you
mean
she's
not
answering?"
Fache
looked
incredulous.
"You're
calling
her
cell
phone,
right?
I
know
she's
carrying
it."
Collet
had
been
trying
to
reach
Sophie
now
for
several
minutes.
"Maybe
her
batteries
are
dead.
Or
her
ringer's
off."
Fache
had
looked
distressed
ever
since
talking
to
the
director
of
Cryptology
on
the
phone.
After
hanging
up,
he
had
marched
over
to
Collet
and
demanded
he
get
Agent
Neveu
on
the
line.
Now
Collet
had
failed,
and
Fache
was
pacing
like
a
caged
lion.
"Why
did
Crypto
call?"
Collet
now
ventured.
Fache
turned.
"To
tell
us
they
found
no
references
to
Draconian
devils
and
lame
saints."
"That's
all?"
"No,
also
to
tell
us
that
they
had
just
identified
the
numerics
as
Fibonacci
numbers,
but
they
suspected
the
series
was
meaningless."
Collet
was
confused.
"But
they
already
sent
Agent
Neveu
to
tell
us
that."
Fache
shook
his
head.
"They
didn't
send
Neveu."
"What?"
"According
to
the
director,
at
my
orders
he
paged
his
entire
team
to
look
at
the
images
I'd
wired
him.
When
Agent
Neveu
arrived,
she
took
one
look
at
the
photos
of
Sauniere
and
the
code
and
left
the
office
without
a
word.
The
director
said
he
didn't
question
her
behavior
because
she
was
understandably
upset
by
the
photos."
"Upset?
She's
never
seen
a
picture
of
a
dead
body?"
Fache
was
silent
a
moment.
"I
was
not
aware
of
this,
and
it
seems
neither
was
the
director
until
a
coworker
informed
him,
but
apparently
Sophie
Neveu
is
Jacques
Sauniere's
granddaughter."
Collet
was
speechless.
"The
director
said
she
never
once
mentioned
Sauniere
to
him,
and
he
assumed
it
was
because
she
probably
didn't
want
preferential
