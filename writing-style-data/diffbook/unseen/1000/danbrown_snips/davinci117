Silas
didn't
mind
the
walk.
The
rain
was
cleansing.
At
Remy's
suggestion,
Silas
had
wiped
down
his
gun
and
disposed
of
it
through
a
sewer
grate.
He
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
it.
He
felt
lighter.
His
legs
still
ached
from
being
bound
all
that
time,
but
Silas
had
endured
far
greater
pain.
He
wondered,
though,
about
Teabing,
whom
Remy
had
left
bound
in
the
back
of
the
limousine.
The
Briton
certainly
had
to
be
feeling
the
pain
by
now.
"What
will
you
do
with
him?"
Silas
had
asked
Remy
as
they
drove
over
here.
Remy
had
shrugged.
"That
is
a
decision
for
the
Teacher."
There
was
an
odd
finality
in
his
tone.
Now,
as
Silas
approached
the
Opus
Dei
building,
the
rain
began
to
fall
harder,
soaking
his
heavy
robe,
stinging
the
wounds
of
the
day
before.
He
was
ready
to
leave
behind
the
sins
of
the
last
twenty
four
hours
and
purge
his
soul.
His
work
was
done.
Moving
across
a
small
courtyard
to
the
front
door,
Silas
was
not
surprised
to
find
the
door
unlocked.
He
opened
it
and
stepped
into
the
minimalist
foyer.
A
muted
electronic
chime
sounded
upstairs
as
Silas
stepped
onto
the
carpet.
The
bell
was
a
common
feature
in
these
halls
where
the
residents
spent
most
of
the
day
in
their
rooms
in
prayer.
Silas
could
hear
movement
above
on
the
creaky
wood
floors.
A
man
in
a
cloak
came
downstairs.
"May
I
help
you?"
He
had
kind
eyes
that
seemed
not
even
to
register
Silas's
startling
physical
appearance.
"Thank
you.
My
name
is
Silas.
I
am
an
Opus
Dei
numerary."
"American?"
Silas
nodded.
"I
am
in
town
only
for
the
day.
Might
I
rest
here?"
"You
need
not
even
ask.
There
are
two
empty
rooms
on
the
third
floor.
Shall
I
bring
you
some
tea
and
bread?"
"Thank
you."
Silas
was
famished.
Silas
went
upstairs
to
a
modest
room
with
a
window,
where
he
took
off
his
wet
robe
and
knelt
down
to
pray
in
his
undergarments.
He
heard
his
host
come
up
and
lay
a
tray
outside
his
door.
Silas
finished
his
prayers,
ate
his
food,
and
lay
down
to
sleep.
Three
stories
below,
a
phone
was
ringing.
The
Opus
Dei
numerary
who
had
welcomed
Silas
answered
the
line.
"This
is
the
London
police,"
the
caller
said.
"We
are
trying
to
find
an
albino
monk.
We've
had
a
tip
off
that
he
might
be
there.
Have
you
seen
him?"
The
numerary
was
startled.
"Yes,
he
is
here.
Is
something
wrong?"
"He
is
there
now?"
"Yes,
upstairs
praying.
What
is
going
on?"
"Leave
him
precisely
where
he
is,"
the
officer
commanded.
"Don't
say
a
word
to
anyone.
I'm
sending
officers
over
right
away.
St.
James's
Park
is
a
sea
of
green
in
the
middle
of
London,
a
public
park
bordering
the
palaces
of
Westminster,
Buckingham,
and
St.
James's.
Once
enclosed
by
King
Henry
VIII
and
stocked
with
deer
for
the
hunt,
St.
James's
Park
is
now
open
to
the
public.
On
sunny
afternoons,
Londoners
picnic
beneath
the
willows
and
feed
the
pond's
resident
pelicans,
whose
ancestors
were
a
gift
to
Charles
II
from
the
Russian
ambassador.
The
Teacher
saw
no
pelicans
today.
The
stormy
weather
had
brought
instead
seagulls
from
the
ocean.
The
lawns
were
covered
with
them
hundreds
of
white
bodies
all
facing
the
same
direction,
patiently
riding
out
the
damp
wind.
Despite
the
morning
fog,
the
park
afforded
splendid
views
of
the
Houses
of
Parliament
and
Big
Ben.
Gazing
across
the
sloping
lawns,
past
the
duck
pond
and
the
delicate
silhouettes
of
the
weeping
willows,
the
Teacher
could
see
the
spires
of
the
building
that
housed
the
knight's
tomb
the
real
reason
he
had
told
Remy
to
come
to
this
spot.
As
the
Teacher
approached
the
front
passenger
door
of
the
parked
limousine,
Remy
leaned
across
and
opened
the
door.
The
Teacher
paused
outside,
taking
a
pull
from
the
flask
of
cognac
he
was
carrying.
Then,
dabbing
his
mouth,
he
slid
in
beside
Remy
and
closed
the
door.
Remy
held
up
the
keystone
like
a
trophy.
"It
was
almost
lost."
"You
have
done
well,"
the
Teacher
said.
"We
have
done
well,"
Remy
replied,
laying
the
keystone
in
the
Teacher's
eager
hands.
The
Teacher
admired
it
a
long
moment,
smiling.
"And
the
gun?
You
wiped
it
down?"
"Back
in
the
glove
box
where
I
found
it."
"Excellent."
The
Teacher
took
another
drink
of
cognac
and
handed
the
flask
to
Remy.
"Let's
toast
our
success.
The
end
is
near."
Remy
accepted
the
bottle
gratefully.
The
cognac
tasted
salty,
but
Remy
didn't
care.
He
and
the
Teacher
were
truly
partners
now.
He
could
feel
himself
ascending
to
a
higher
station
in
life.
will
never
be
a
servant
again.
As
Remy
gazed
down
the
embankment
at
the
duck
pond
below,
Chateau
Villette
seemed
miles
away.
Taking
another
swig
from
the
flask,
Remy
could
feel
the
cognac
warming
his
blood.
The
warmth
in
Remy's
throat,
however,
mutated
quickly
to
an
uncomfortable
heat.
Loosening
his
bow
tie,
Remy
tasted
an
unpleasant
grittiness
and
handed
the
flask
back
to
the
Teacher.
"I've
probably
had
enough,"
he
managed,
weakly.
Taking
the
flask,
the
Teacher
said,
"Remy,
as
you
are
aware,
you
are
the
only
one
who
knows
my
face.
I
placed
enormous
trust
in
you."
"Yes,"
he
said,
feeling
feverish
as
he
loosened
his
tie
further.
"And
your
identity
shall
go
with
me
to
the
grave."
The
Teacher
was
silent
a
long
moment.
"I
believe
you."
Pocketing
the
flask
and
the
keystone,
the
Teacher
reached
for
the
glove
box
and
pulled
out
the
tiny
Medusa
revolver.
For
an
instant,
Remy
felt
a
surge
of
fear,
but
the
Teacher
simply
slipped
it
in
his
trousers
pocket.
What
is
he
doing?
Remy
felt
himself
sweating
suddenly.
"I
know
I
promised
you
freedom,"
the
Teacher
said,
his
voice
now
sounding
regretful.
"But
considering
your
circumstances,
this
is
the
best
I
can
do."
The
swelling
in
Remy's
throat
came
on
like
an
earthquake,
and
he
lurched
against
the
steering
column,
grabbing
