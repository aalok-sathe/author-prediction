The
ultimate
research
tool,
Langdon
had
heard.
Instant
answers
to
any
religious
historical
question.
He
wondered
what
the
database
would
have
to
say
about
"a
knight
a
Pope
interred."
He
stood
up
and
paced,
wishing
the
train
would
hurry.
At
the
pay
phone,
Sophie's
call
finally
connected
to
the
London
police.
"Snow
Hill
Division,"
the
dispatcher
said.
"How
may
I
direct
your
call?"
"I'm
reporting
a
kidnapping."
Sophie
knew
to
be
concise.
"Name
please?"
Sophie
paused.
"Agent
Sophie
Neveu
with
the
French
Judicial
Police."
The
title
had
the
desired
effect.
"Right
away,
ma'am.
Let
me
get
a
detective
on
the
line
for
you."
As
the
call
went
through,
Sophie
began
wondering
if
the
police
would
even
believe
her
description
of
Teabing's
captors.
A
man
in
a
tuxedo.
How
much
easier
to
identify
could
a
suspect
be?
Even
if
Remy
changed
clothes,
he
was
partnered
with
an
albino
monk.
Impossible
to
miss.
Moreover,
they
had
a
hostage
and
could
not
take
public
transportation.
She
wondered
how
many
Jaguar
stretch
limos
there
could
be
in
London.
Sophie's
connection
to
the
detective
seemed
to
be
taking
forever.
Come
on!
She
could
hear
the
line
clicking
and
buzzing,
as
if
she
was
being
transferred.
Fifteen
seconds
passed.
Finally
a
man
came
on
the
line.
"Agent
Neveu?"
Stunned,
Sophie
registered
the
gruff
tone
immediately.
"Agent
Neveu,"
Bezu
Fache
demanded.
"Where
the
hell
are
you?"
Sophie
was
speechless.
Captain
Fache
had
apparently
requested
the
London
police
dispatcher
alert
him
if
Sophie
called
in.
"Listen,"
Fache
said,
speaking
to
her
in
terse
French.
"I
made
a
terrible
mistake
tonight.
Robert
Langdon
is
innocent.
All
charges
against
him
have
been
dropped.
Even
so,
both
of
you
are
in
danger.
You
need
to
come
in."
Sophie's
jaw
fell
slack.
She
had
no
idea
how
to
respond.
Fache
was
not
a
man
who
apologized
for
anything.
"You
did
not
tell
me,"
Fache
continued,
"that
Jacques
Sauniere
was
your
grandfather.
I
fully
intend
to
overlook
your
insubordination
last
night
on
account
of
the
emotional
stress
you
must
be
under.
At
the
moment,
however,
you
and
Langdon
need
to
go
to
the
nearest
London
police
headquarters
for
refuge."
He
knows
I'm
in
London?
What
else
does
Fache
know?
Sophie
heard
what
sounded
like
drilling
or
machinery
in
the
background.
She
also
heard
an
odd
clicking
on
the
line.
"Are
you
tracing
this
call,
Captain?"
Fache's
voice
was
firm
now.
"You
and
I
need
to
cooperate,
Agent
Neveu.
We
both
have
a
lot
to
lose
here.
This
is
damage
control.
I
made
errors
in
judgment
last
night,
and
if
those
errors
result
in
the
deaths
of
an
American
professor
and
a
DCPJ
cryptologist,
my
career
will
be
over.
I've
been
trying
to
pull
you
back
into
safety
for
the
last
several
hours."
A
warm
wind
was
now
pushing
through
the
station
as
a
train
approached
with
a
low
rumble.
Sophie
had
every
intention
of
being
on
it.
Langdon
apparently
had
the
same
idea;
he
was
gathering
himself
together
and
moving
toward
her
now.
"The
man
you
want
is
Remy
Legaludec,"
Sophie
said.
"He
is
Teabing's
servant.
He
just
kidnapped
Teabing
inside
the
Temple
Church
and
"Agent
Neveu!"
Fache
bellowed
as
the
train
thundered
into
the
station.
"This
is
not
something
to
discuss
on
an
open
line.
You
and
Langdon
will
come
in
now.
For
your
own
well
being!
That
is
a
direct
order!"
Sophie
hung
up
and
dashed
with
Langdon
onto
the
train.
The
immaculate
cabin
of
Teabing's
Hawker
was
now
covered
with
steel
shavings
and
smelled
of
compressed
air
and
propane.
Bezu
Fache
had
sent
everyone
away
and
sat
alone
with
his
drink
and
the
heavy
wooden
box
found
in
Teabing's
safe.
Running
his
finger
across
the
inlaid
Rose,
he
lifted
the
ornate
lid.
Inside
he
found
a
stone
cylinder
with
lettered
dials.
The
five
dials
were
arranged
to
spell
SOFIA.
Fache
stared
at
the
word
a
long
moment
and
then
lifted
the
cylinder
from
its
padded
resting
place
and
examined
every
inch.
Then,
pulling
slowly
on
the
ends,
Fache
slid
off
one
of
the
end
caps.
The
cylinder
was
empty.
Fache
set
it
back
in
the
box
and
gazed
absently
out
the
jet's
window
at
the
hangar,
pondering
his
brief
conversation
with
Sophie,
as
well
as
the
information
he'd
received
from
PTS
in
Chateau
Villette.
The
sound
of
his
phone
shook
him
from
his
daydream.
It
was
the
DCPJ
switchboard.
The
dispatcher
was
apologetic.
The
president
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
had
been
calling
repeatedly,
and
although
he
had
been
told
several
times
that
the
captain
was
in
London
on
business,
he
just
kept
calling.
Begrudgingly
Fache
told
the
operator
to
forward
the
call.
"Monsieur
Vernet,"
Fache
said,
before
the
man
could
even
speak,
"I
am
sorry
I
did
not
call
you
earlier.
I
have
been
busy.
As
promised,
the
name
of
your
bank
has
not
appeared
in
the
media.
So
what
precisely
is
your
concern?"
Vernet's
voice
was
anxious
as
he
told
Fache
how
Langdon
and
Sophie
had
extracted
a
small
wooden
box
from
the
bank
and
then
persuaded
Vernet
to
help
them
escape.
"Then
when
I
heard
on
the
radio
that
they
were
criminals,"
Vernet
said,
"I
pulled
over
and
demanded
the
box
back,
but
they
attacked
me
and
stole
the
truck.
"You
are
concerned
for
a
wooden
box,"
Fache
said,
eyeing
the
Rose
inlay
on
the
cover
and
again
gently
opening
the
lid
to
reveal
the
white
cylinder.
"Can
you
tell
me
what
was
in
the
box?"
"The
contents
are
immaterial,"
Vernet
fired
back.
"I
am
concerned
with
the
reputation
of
my
bank.
We
have
never
had
a
robbery.
Ever.
It
will
ruin
us
if
I
cannot
recover
this
property
on
behalf
of
my
client."
"You
said
Agent
Neveu
and
Robert
Langdon
had
a
password
and
a
key.
What
makes
you
say
they
stole
the
box?"
"They
murdered
people
tonight.
Including
Sophie
Neveu's
grandfather.
The
key
and
password
were
obviously
ill
gotten."
"Mr.
Vernet,
my
men
have
done
some
checking
into
your
background
and
your
interests.
You
