her
as
the
progenitor
of
the
royal
line
of
kings.
Countless
scholars
of
that
era
chronicled
Mary
Magdalene's
days
in
France,
including
the
birth
of
Sarah
and
the
subsequent
family
tree."
Sophie
was
startled.
"There
exists
a
family
tree
of
Jesus
Christ?"
"Indeed.
And
it
is
purportedly
one
of
the
cornerstones
of
the
Sangreal
documents.
A
complete
genealogy
of
the
early
descendants
of
Christ."
"But
what
good
is
a
documented
genealogy
of
Christ's
bloodline?"
Sophie
asked.
"It's
not
proof.
Historians
could
not
possibly
confirm
its
authenticity."
Teabing
chuckled.
"No
more
so
than
they
can
confirm
the
authenticity
of
the
Bible.
"Meaning?"
"Meaning
that
history
is
always
written
by
the
winners.
When
two
cultures
clash,
the
loser
is
obliterated,
and
the
winner
writes
the
history
books
books
which
glorify
their
own
cause
and
disparage
the
conquered
foe.
As
Napoleon
once
said,
'What
is
history,
but
a
fable
agreed
upon?'
He
smiled.
"By
its
very
nature,
history
is
always
a
one
sided
account."
Sophie
had
never
thought
of
it
that
way.
"The
Sangreal
documents
simply
tell
the
other
side
of
the
Christ
story.
In
the
end,
which
side
of
the
story
you
believe
becomes
a
matter
of
faith
and
personal
exploration,
but
at
least
the
information
has
survived.
The
Sangreal
documents
include
tens
of
thousands
of
pages
of
information.
Eyewitness
accounts
of
the
Sangreal
treasure
describe
it
as
being
carried
in
four
enormous
trunks.
In
those
trunks
are
reputed
to
be
the
Purist
Documents
thousands
of
pages
of
unaltered,
pre
Constantine
documents,
written
by
the
early
followers
of
Jesus,
revering
Him
as
a
wholly
human
teacher
and
prophet.
Also
rumored
to
be
part
of
the
treasure
is
the
legendary
"Q"
Document
a
manuscript
that
even
the
Vatican
admits
they
believe
exists.
Allegedly,
it
is
a
book
of
Jesus'
teachings,
possibly
written
in
His
own
hand."
"Writings
by
Christ
Himself?"
"Of
course,"
Teabing
said.
"Why
wouldn't
Jesus
have
kept
a
chronicle
of
His
ministry?
Most
people
did
in
those
days.
Another
explosive
document
believed
to
be
in
the
treasure
is
a
manuscript
called
The
Magdalene
Diaries
Mary
Magdalene's
personal
account
of
her
relationship
with
Christ,
His
crucifixion,
and
her
time
in
France."
Sophie
was
silent
for
a
long
moment.
"And
these
four
chests
of
documents
were
the
treasure
that
the
Knights
Templar
found
under
Solomon's
Temple?"
"Exactly.
The
documents
that
made
the
Knights
so
powerful.
The
documents
that
have
been
the
object
of
countless
Grail
quests
throughout
history."
"But
you
said
the
Holy
Grail
was
Mary
Magdalene.
If
people
are
searching
for
documents,
why
would
you
call
it
a
search
for
the
Holy
Grail?"
Teabing
eyed
her,
his
expression
softening.
"Because
the
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail
includes
a
sarcophagus."
Outside,
the
wind
howled
in
the
trees.
Teabing
spoke
more
quietly
now.
"The
quest
for
the
Holy
Grail
is
literally
the
quest
to
kneel
before
the
bones
of
Mary
Magdalene.
A
journey
to
pray
at
the
feet
of
the
outcast
one,
the
lost
sacred
feminine."
Sophie
felt
an
unexpected
wonder.
"The
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail
is
actually
a
tomb?"
Teabing's
hazel
eyes
got
misty.
"It
is.
A
tomb
containing
the
body
of
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
documents
that
tell
the
true
story
of
her
life.
At
its
heart,
the
quest
for
the
Holy
Grail
has
always
been
a
quest
for
the
Magdalene
the
wronged
Queen,
entombed
with
proof
of
her
family's
rightful
claim
to
power.
Sophie
waited
a
moment
as
Teabing
gathered
himself.
So
much
about
her
grandfather
was
still
not
making
sense.
"Members
of
the
Priory,"
she
finally
said,
"all
these
years
have
answered
the
charge
of
protecting
the
Sangreal
documents
and
the
tomb
of
Mary
Magdalene?"
"Yes,
but
the
brotherhood
had
another,
more
important
duty
as
well
to
protect
the
bloodline
itself.
Christ's
lineage
was
in
perpetual
danger.
The
early
Church
feared
that
if
the
lineage
were
permitted
to
grow,
the
secret
of
Jesus
and
Magdalene
would
eventually
surface
and
challenge
the
fundamental
Catholic
doctrine
that
of
a
divine
Messiah
who
did
not
consort
with
women
or
engage
in
sexual
union."
He
paused.
"Nonetheless,
Christ's
line
grew
quietly
under
cover
in
France
until
making
a
bold
move
in
the
fifth
century,
when
it
intermarried
with
French
royal
blood
and
created
a
lineage
known
as
the
Merovingian
bloodline.
This
news
surprised
Sophie.
Merovingian
was
a
term
learned
by
every
student
in
France.
"The
Merovingians
founded
Paris."
"Yes.
That's
one
of
the
reasons
the
Grail
legend
is
so
rich
in
France.
Many
of
the
Vatican's
Grail
quests
here
were
in
fact
stealth
missions
to
erase
members
of
the
royal
bloodline.
Have
you
heard
of
King
Dagobert?"
Sophie
vaguely
recalled
the
name
from
a
grisly
tale
in
history
class.
"Dagobert
was
a
Merovingian
king,
wasn't
he?
Stabbed
in
the
eye
while
sleeping?"
"Exactly.
Assassinated
by
the
Vatican
in
collusion
with
Pepin
d'Heristal.
Late
seventh
century.
With
Dagobert's
murder,
the
Merovingian
bloodline
was
almost
exterminated.
Fortunately,
Dagobert's
son,
Sigisbert,
secretly
escaped
the
attack
and
carried
on
the
lineage,
which
later
included
Godefroi
de
Bouillon
founder
of
the
Priory
of
Sion."
"The
same
man,"
Langdon
said,
"who
ordered
the
Knights
Templar
to
recover
the
Sangreal
documents
from
beneath
Solomon's
Temple
and
thus
provide
the
Merovingians
proof
of
their
hereditary
ties
to
Jesus
Christ."
Teabing
nodded,
heaving
a
ponderous
sigh.
"The
modern
Priory
of
Sion
has
a
momentous
duty.
Theirs
is
a
threefold
charge.
The
brotherhood
must
protect
the
Sangreal
documents.
They
must
protect
the
tomb
of
Mary
Magdalene.
And,
of
course,
they
must
nurture
and
protect
the
bloodline
of
Christ
those
few
members
of
the
royal
Merovingian
bloodline
who
have
survived
into
modern
times."
The
words
hung
in
the
huge
space,
and
Sophie
felt
an
odd
vibration,
as
if
her
bones
were
reverberating
with
some
new
kind
of
truth.
Descendants
of
Jesus
who
survived
into
modern
times.
Her
grandfather's
voice
again
was
whispering
in
her
ear.
Princess,
I
must
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
family.
A
chill
raked
her
flesh.
Royal
blood.
She
could
not
imagine.
Princess
Sophie.
"Sir
Leigh?"
The
manservant's
