one
in
constant
conflict
with
the
Church."
As
Langdon
said
this,
an
odd
thought
popped
into
his
mind.
He
glanced
down
at
the
message
on
the
floor
again.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Oh,
lame
saint!
"Yes?"
Fache
said.
Langdon
weighed
his
words
carefully.
"I
was
just
thinking
that
Sauniere
shared
a
lot
of
spiritual
ideologies
with
Da
Vinci,
including
a
concern
over
the
Church's
elimination
of
the
sacred
feminine
from
modern
religion.
Maybe,
by
imitating
a
famous
Da
Vinci
drawing,
Sauniere
was
simply
echoing
some
of
their
shared
frustrations
with
the
modern
Church's
demonization
of
the
goddess."
Fache's
eyes
hardened.
"You
think
Sauniere
is
calling
the
Church
a
lame
saint
and
a
Draconian
devil?"
Langdon
had
to
admit
it
seemed
far
fetched,
and
yet
the
pentacle
seemed
to
endorse
the
idea
on
some
level.
"All
I
am
saying
is
that
Mr.
Sauniere
dedicated
his
life
to
studying
the
history
of
the
goddess,
and
nothing
has
done
more
to
erase
that
history
than
the
Catholic
Church.
It
seems
reasonable
that
Sauniere
might
have
chosen
to
express
his
disappointment
in
his
final
good
bye."
"Disappointment?"
Fache
demanded,
sounding
hostile
now.
"This
message
sounds
more
enraged
than
disappointed,
wouldn't
you
say?"
Langdon
was
reaching
the
end
of
his
patience.
"Captain,
you
asked
for
my
instincts
as
to
what
Sauniere
is
trying
to
say
here,
and
that's
what
I'm
giving
you."
"That
this
is
an
indictment
of
the
Church?"
Fache's
jaw
tightened
as
he
spoke
through
clenched
teeth.
"Mr.
Langdon,
I
have
seen
a
lot
of
death
in
my
work,
and
let
me
tell
you
something.
When
a
man
is
murdered
by
another
man,
I
do
not
believe
his
final
thoughts
are
to
write
an
obscure
spiritual
statement
that
no
one
will
understand.
I
believe
he
is
thinking
of
one
thing
only."
Fache's
whispery
voice
sliced
the
air.
"La
vengeance.
I
believe
Sauniere
wrote
this
note
to
tell
us
who
killed
him."
Langdon
stared.
"But
that
makes
no
sense
whatsoever."
"No?"
"No,"
he
fired
back,
tired
and
frustrated.
"You
told
me
Sauniere
was
attacked
in
his
office
by
someone
he
had
apparently
invited
in."
"Yes."
"So
it
seems
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
curator
knew
his
attacker."
Fache
nodded.
"Go
on."
"So
if
Sauniere
knew
the
person
who
killed
him,
what
kind
of
indictment
is
this?"
He
pointed
at
the
floor.
"Numeric
codes?
Lame
saints?
Draconian
devils?
Pentacles
on
his
stomach?
It's
all
too
cryptic."
Fache
frowned
as
if
the
idea
had
never
occurred
to
him.
"You
have
a
point."
"Considering
the
circumstances,"
Langdon
said,
"I
would
assume
that
if
Sauniere
wanted
to
tell
you
who
killed
him,
he
would
have
written
down
somebody's
name.
As
Langdon
spoke
those
words,
a
smug
smile
crossed
Fache's
lips
for
the
first
time
all
night.
"Precisement,
"
Fache
said.
"Precisement.
I
am
witnessing
the
work
of
a
master,
mused
Lieutenant
Collet
as
he
tweaked
his
audio
gear
and
listened
to
Fache's
voice
coming
through
the
headphones.
The
agent
superieur
knew
it
was
moments
like
these
that
had
lifted
the
captain
to
the
pinnacle
of
French
law
enforcement.
Fache
will
do
what
no
one
else
dares.
The
delicate
art
of
cajoler
was
a
lost
skill
in
modern
law
enforcement,
one
that
required
exceptional
poise
under
pressure.
Few
men
possessed
the
necessary
sangfroid
for
this
kind
of
operation,
but
Fache
seemed
born
for
it.
His
restraint
and
patience
bordered
on
the
robotic.
Fache's
sole
emotion
this
evening
seemed
to
be
one
of
intense
resolve,
as
if
this
arrest
were
somehow
personal
to
him.
Fache's
briefing
of
his
agents
an
hour
ago
had
been
unusually
succinct
and
assured.
know
who
murdered
Jacques
Sauniere,
Fache
had
said.
You
know
what
to
do.
No
mistakes
tonight.
And
so
far,
no
mistakes
had
been
made.
Collet
was
not
yet
privy
to
the
evidence
that
had
cemented
Fache's
certainty
of
their
suspect's
guilt,
but
he
knew
better
than
to
question
the
instincts
of
the
Bull.
Fache's
intuition
seemed
almost
supernatural
at
times.
God
whispers
in
his
ear,
one
agent
had
insisted
after
a
particularly
impressive
display
of
Fache's
sixth
sense.
Collet
had
to
admit,
if
there
was
a
God,
Bezu
Fache
would
be
on
His
A
list.
The
captain
attended
mass
and
confession
with
zealous
regularity
far
more
than
the
requisite
holiday
attendance
fulfilled
by
other
officials
in
the
name
of
good
public
relations.
When
the
Pope
visited
Paris
a
few
years
back,
Fache
had
used
all
his
muscle
to
obtain
the
honor
of
an
audience.
A
photo
of
Fache
with
the
Pope
now
hung
in
his
office.
The
Papal
Bull,
the
agents
secretly
called
it.
Collet
found
it
ironic
that
one
of
Fache's
rare
popular
public
stances
in
recent
years
had
been
his
outspoken
reaction
to
the
Catholic
pedophilia
scandal.
These
priests
should
be
hanged
twice!
Fache
had
declared.
Once
for
their
crimes
against
children.
And
once
for
shaming
the
good
name
of
the
Catholic
Church.
Collet
had
the
odd
sense
it
was
the
latter
that
angered
Fache
more.
Turning
now
to
his
laptop
computer,
Collet
attended
to
the
other
half
of
his
responsibilities
here
tonight
the
GPS
tracking
system.
The
image
onscreen
revealed
a
detailed
floor
plan
of
the
Denon
Wing,
a
structural
schematic
uploaded
from
the
Louvre
Security
Office.
Letting
his
eyes
trace
the
maze
of
galleries
and
hallways,
Collet
found
what
he
was
looking
for.
Deep
in
the
heart
of
the
Grand
Gallery
blinked
a
tiny
red
dot.
La
marque.
Fache
was
keeping
his
prey
on
a
very
tight
leash
tonight.
Wisely
so.
Robert
Langdon
had
proven
himself
one
cool
customer.
To
ensure
his
conversation
with
Mr.
Langdon
would
not
be
interrupted,
Bezu
Fache
had
turned
off
his
cellular
phone.
Unfortunately,
it
was
an
expensive
model
equipped
with
a
two
way
radio
feature,
which,
contrary
to
his
orders,
was
now
being
used
by
one
of
his
agents
to
page
him.
"Capitaine?"
The
phone
crackled
like
a
walkie
talkie.
Fache
felt
his
teeth
clench
in
rage.
He
could
imagine
nothing
important
enough
that
Collet
would
interrupt
this
surveillance
cachee
especially
at
this
