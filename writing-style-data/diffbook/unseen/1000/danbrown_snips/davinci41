felt
heavy
and
dangerously
foreign.
Taking
the
stairs
two
at
a
time,
Langdon
wondered
if
Sophie
had
any
idea
how
valuable
a
painting
she
had
almost
ruined.
Her
choice
in
art
seemed
eerily
pertinent
to
tonight's
adventure.
The
Da
Vinci
she
had
grabbed,
much
like
the
Mona
Lisa,
was
notorious
among
art
historians
for
its
plethora
of
hidden
pagan
symbolism.
"You
chose
a
valuable
hostage,"
he
said
as
they
ran.
"Madonna
of
the
Rocks,
"
she
replied.
"But
I
didn't
choose
it,
my
grandfather
did.
He
left
me
a
little
something
behind
the
painting."
Langdon
shot
her
a
startled
look.
"What!?
But
how
did
you
know
which
painting?
Why
Madonna
of
the
Rocks?"
"So
dark
the
con
of
man."
She
flashed
a
triumphant
smile.
"I
missed
the
first
two
anagrams,
Robert.
I
wasn't
about
to
miss
the
third."
"They're
dead!"
Sister
Sandrine
stammered
into
the
telephone
in
her
Saint
Sulpice
residence.
She
was
leaving
a
message
on
an
answering
machine.
"Please
pick
up!
They're
all
dead!"
The
first
three
phone
numbers
on
the
list
had
produced
terrifying
results
a
hysterical
widow,
a
detective
working
late
at
a
murder
scene,
and
a
somber
priest
consoling
a
bereaved
family.
All
three
contacts
were
dead.
And
now,
as
she
called
the
fourth
and
final
number
the
number
she
was
not
supposed
to
call
unless
the
first
three
could
not
be
reached
she
got
an
answering
machine.
The
outgoing
message
offered
no
name
but
simply
asked
the
caller
to
leave
a
message.
"The
floor
panel
has
been
broken!"
she
pleaded
as
she
left
the
message.
"The
other
three
are
dead!"
Sister
Sandrine
did
not
know
the
identities
of
the
four
men
she
protected,
but
the
private
phone
numbers
stashed
beneath
her
bed
were
for
use
on
only
one
condition.
If
that
floor
panel
is
ever
broken,
the
faceless
messenger
had
told
her,
it
means
the
upper
echelon
has
been
breached.
One
of
us
has
been
mortally
threatened
and
been
forced
to
tell
a
desperate
lie.
Call
the
numbers.
Warn
the
others.
Do
not
fail
us
in
this.
It
was
a
silent
alarm.
Foolproof
in
its
simplicity.
The
plan
had
amazed
her
when
she
first
heard
it.
If
the
identity
of
one
brother
was
compromised,
he
could
tell
a
lie
that
would
start
in
motion
a
mechanism
to
warn
the
others.
Tonight,
however,
it
seemed
that
more
than
one
had
been
compromised.
"Please
answer,"
she
whispered
in
fear.
"Where
are
you?"
"Hang
up
the
phone,"
a
deep
voice
said
from
the
doorway.
Turning
in
terror,
she
saw
the
massive
monk.
He
was
clutching
the
heavy
iron
candle
stand.
Shaking,
she
set
the
phone
back
in
the
cradle.
"They
are
dead,"
the
monk
said.
"All
four
of
them.
And
they
have
played
me
for
a
fool.
Tell
me
where
the
keystone
is."
"I
don't
know!"
Sister
Sandrine
said
truthfully.
"That
secret
is
guarded
by
others."
Others
who
are
dead!
The
man
advanced,
his
white
fists
gripping
the
iron
stand.
"You
are
a
sister
of
the
Church,
and
yet
you
serve
them?"
"Jesus
had
but
one
true
message,"
Sister
Sandrine
said
defiantly.
"I
cannot
see
that
message
in
Opus
Dei."
A
sudden
explosion
of
rage
erupted
behind
the
monk's
eyes.
He
lunged,
lashing
out
with
the
candle
stand
like
a
club.
As
Sister
Sandrine
fell,
her
last
feeling
was
an
overwhelming
sense
of
foreboding.
All
four
are
dead.
The
precious
truth
is
lost
forever.
The
security
alarm
on
the
west
end
of
the
Denon
Wing
sent
the
pigeons
in
the
nearby
Tuileries
Gardens
scattering
as
Langdon
and
Sophie
dashed
out
of
the
bulkhead
into
the
Paris
night.
As
they
ran
across
the
plaza
to
Sophie's
car,
Langdon
could
hear
police
sirens
wailing
in
the
distance.
"That's
it
there,"
Sophie
called,
pointing
to
a
red
snub
nosed
two
seater
parked
on
the
plaza.
She's
kidding,
right?
The
vehicle
was
easily
the
smallest
car
Langdon
had
ever
seen.
"SmartCar,"
she
said.
"A
hundred
kilometers
to
the
liter."
Langdon
had
barely
thrown
himself
into
the
passenger
seat
before
Sophie
gunned
the
SmartCar
up
and
over
a
curb
onto
a
gravel
divider.
He
gripped
the
dash
as
the
car
shot
out
across
a
sidewalk
and
bounced
back
down
over
into
the
small
rotary
at
Carrousel
du
Louvre.
For
an
instant,
Sophie
seemed
to
consider
taking
the
shortcut
across
the
rotary
by
plowing
straight
ahead,
through
the
median's
perimeter
hedge,
and
bisecting
the
large
circle
of
grass
in
the
center.
"No!"
Langdon
shouted,
knowing
the
hedges
around
Carrousel
du
Louvre
were
there
to
hide
the
perilous
chasm
in
the
center
La
Pyramide
Inversee
the
upside
down
pyramid
skylight
he
had
seen
earlier
from
inside
the
museum.
It
was
large
enough
to
swallow
their
Smart
Car
in
a
single
gulp.
Fortunately,
Sophie
decided
on
the
more
conventional
route,
jamming
the
wheel
hard
to
the
right,
circling
properly
until
she
exited,
cut
left,
and
swung
into
the
northbound
lane,
accelerating
toward
Rue
de
Rivoli.
The
two
tone
police
sirens
blared
louder
behind
them,
and
Langdon
could
see
the
lights
now
in
his
side
view
mirror.
The
SmartCar
engine
whined
in
protest
as
Sophie
urged
it
faster
away
from
the
Louvre.
Fifty
yards
ahead,
the
traffic
light
at
Rivoli
turned
red.
Sophie
cursed
under
her
breath
and
kept
racing
toward
it.
Langdon
felt
his
muscles
tighten.
"Sophie?"
Slowing
only
slightly
as
they
reached
the
intersection,
Sophie
flicked
her
headlights
and
stole
a
quick
glance
both
ways
before
flooring
the
accelerator
again
and
carving
a
sharp
left
turn
through
the
empty
intersection
onto
Rivoli.
Accelerating
west
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile,
Sophie
banked
to
the
right
around
a
wide
rotary.
Soon
they
were
shooting
out
the
other
side
onto
the
wide
avenue
of
Champs
Ely
sees.
As
they
straightened
out,
Langdon
turned
in
his
seat,
craning
his
neck
to
look
out
the
rear
window
toward
the
Louvre.
The
police
did
not
seem
to
be
chasing
them.
The
sea
of
blue
lights
was
assembling
at
the
museum.
His
heartbeat
finally
slowing,
Langdon
turned
back
around.
"That
