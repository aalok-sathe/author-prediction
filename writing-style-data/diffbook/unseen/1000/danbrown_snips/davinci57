slip
of
paper?"
Sophie
knew
she
had
been
in
a
hurry
inside
the
Louvre,
but
she
was
certain
she
had
seen
nothing
else
behind
Madonna
of
the
Rocks.
"No.
Just
the
key."
Vernet
gave
a
helpless
sigh.
"I'm
afraid
every
key
is
electronically
paired
with
a
ten
digit
account
number
that
functions
as
a
password.
Without
that
number,
your
key
is
worthless."
Ten
digits.
Sophie
reluctantly
calculated
the
cryptographic
odds.
Over
ten
billion
possible
choices.
Even
if
she
could
bring
in
DCPJ's
most
powerful
parallel
processing
computers,
she
still
would
need
weeks
to
break
the
code.
"Certainly,
monsieur,
considering
the
circumstances,
you
can
help
us."
"I'm
sorry.
I
truly
can
do
nothing.
Clients
select
their
own
account
numbers
via
a
secure
terminal,
meaning
account
numbers
are
known
only
to
the
client
and
computer.
This
is
one
way
we
ensure
anonymity.
And
the
safety
of
our
employees."
Sophie
understood.
Convenience
stores
did
the
same
thing.
EMPLOYEES
DO
NOT
HAVE
KEYS
TO
THE
SAFE.
This
bank
obviously
did
not
want
to
risk
someone
stealing
a
key
and
then
holding
an
employee
hostage
for
the
account
number.
Sophie
sat
down
beside
Langdon,
glanced
down
at
the
key
and
then
up
at
Vernet.
"Do
you
have
any
idea
what
my
grandfather
is
storing
in
your
bank?"
"None
whatsoever.
That
is
the
definition
of
a
Geldschrank
bank."
"Monsieur
Vernet,"
she
pressed,
"our
time
tonight
is
short.
I
am
going
to
be
very
direct
if
I
may."
She
reached
out
to
the
gold
key
and
flipped
it
over,
watching
the
man's
eyes
as
she
revealed
the
Priory
of
Sion
seal.
"Does
the
symbol
on
this
key
mean
anything
to
you?"
Vernet
glanced
down
at
the
fleur
de
lis
seal
and
made
no
reaction.
"No,
but
many
of
our
clients
emboss
corporate
logos
or
initials
onto
their
keys."
Sophie
sighed,
still
watching
him
carefully.
"This
seal
is
the
symbol
of
a
secret
society
known
as
the
Priory
of
Sion."
Vernet
again
showed
no
reaction.
"I
know
nothing
of
this.
Your
grandfather
was
a
friend,
but
we
spoke
mostly
of
business."
The
man
adjusted
his
tie,
looking
nervous
now.
"Monsieur
Vernet,"
Sophie
pressed,
her
tone
firm.
"My
grandfather
called
me
tonight
and
told
me
he
and
I
were
in
grave
danger.
He
said
he
had
to
give
me
something.
He
gave
me
a
key
to
your
bank.
Now
he
is
dead.
Anything
you
can
tell
us
would
be
helpful."
Vernet
broke
a
sweat.
"We
need
to
get
out
of
the
building.
I'm
afraid
the
police
will
arrive
shortly.
My
watchman
felt
obliged
to
call
Interpol."
Sophie
had
feared
as
much.
She
took
one
last
shot.
"My
grandfather
said
he
needed
to
tell
me
the
truth
about
my
family.
Does
that
mean
anything
to
you?"
"Mademoiselle,
your
family
died
in
a
car
accident
when
you
were
young.
I'm
sorry.
I
know
your
grandfather
loved
you
very
much.
He
mentioned
to
me
several
times
how
much
it
pained
him
that
you
two
had
fallen
out
of
touch."
Sophie
was
uncertain
how
to
respond.
Langdon
asked,
"Do
the
contents
of
this
account
have
anything
to
do
with
the
Sangreal?"
Vernet
gave
him
an
odd
look.
"I
have
no
idea
what
that
is."
Just
then,
Vernet's
cell
phone
rang,
and
he
snatched
it
off
his
belt.
"Oui?"
He
listened
a
moment,
his
expression
one
of
surprise
and
growing
concern.
"La
police?
Si
rapidement?"
He
cursed,
gave
some
quick
directions
in
French,
and
said
he
would
be
up
to
the
lobby
in
a
minute.
Hanging
up
the
phone,
he
turned
back
to
Sophie.
"The
police
have
responded
far
more
quickly
than
usual.
They
are
arriving
as
we
speak."
Sophie
had
no
intention
of
leaving
empty
handed.
"Tell
them
we
came
and
went
already.
If
they
want
to
search
the
bank,
demand
a
search
warrant.
That
will
take
them
time."
"Listen,"
Vernet
said,
"Jacques
was
a
friend,
and
my
bank
does
not
need
this
kind
of
press,
so
for
those
two
reasons,
I
have
no
intention
of
allowing
this
arrest
to
be
made
on
my
premises.
Give
me
a
minute
and
I
will
see
what
I
can
do
to
help
you
leave
the
bank
undetected.
Beyond
that,
I
cannot
get
involved."
He
stood
up
and
hurried
for
the
door.
"Stay
here.
I'll
make
arrangements
and
be
right
back."
"But
the
safe
deposit
box,"
Sophie
declared.
"We
can't
just
leave."
"There's
nothing
I
can
do,"
Vernet
said,
hurrying
out
the
door.
"I'm
sorry."
Sophie
stared
after
him
a
moment,
wondering
if
maybe
the
account
number
was
buried
in
one
of
the
countless
letters
and
packages
her
grandfather
had
sent
her
over
the
years
and
which
she
had
left
unopened.
Langdon
stood
suddenly,
and
Sophie
sensed
an
unexpected
glimmer
of
contentment
in
his
eyes.
"Robert?
You're
smiling."
"Your
grandfather
was
a
genius."
"I'm
sorry?"
"Ten
digits?"
Sophie
had
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about.
"The
account
number,"
he
said,
a
familiar
lopsided
grin
now
craning
his
face.
"I'm
pretty
sure
he
left
it
for
us
after
all.
"Where?"
Langdon
produced
the
printout
of
the
crime
scene
photo
and
spread
it
out
on
the
coffee
table.
Sophie
needed
only
to
read
the
first
line
to
know
Langdon
was
correct.

"Ten

Sophie
said,
her
cryptologic
senses
tingling
as
she
studied
the
printout.

Grand
pere
wrote
his
account
number
on
the
Louvre
floor!
When
Sophie
had
first
seen
the
scrambled
Fibonacci
sequence
on
the
parquet,
she
had
assumed
its
sole
purpose
was
to
encourage
DCPJ
to
call
in
their
cryptographers
and
get
Sophie
involved.
Later,
she
realized
the
numbers
were
also
a
clue
as
to
how
to
decipher
the
other
lines
a
sequence
out
of
order
a
numeric
anagram.
Now,
utterly
amazed,
she
saw
the
numbers
had
a
more
important
meaning
still.
They
were
almost
certainly
the
final
key
to
opening
her
grandfather's
mysterious
safe
deposit
box.
"He
was
the
