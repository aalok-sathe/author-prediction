my
lawyers."
He
scowled
toward
the
monk
in
the
rear
of
the
plane.
"That
animal
broke
into
my
home
and
almost
killed
me.
That
is
a
fact,
and
Remy
will
corroborate."
"But
you
tied
him
up
and
flew
him
to
London!"
Langdon
said.
Teabing
held
up
his
right
hand
and
feigned
a
courtroom
oath.
"Your
honor,
forgive
an
eccentric
old
knight
his
foolish
prejudice
for
the
British
court
system.
I
realize
I
should
have
called
the
French
authorities,
but
I'm
a
snob
and
do
not
trust
those
laissez
faire
French
to
prosecute
properly.
This
man
almost
murdered
me.
Yes,
I
made
a
rash
decision
forcing
my
manservant
to
help
me
bring
him
to
England,
but
I
was
under
great
stress.
Mea
culpa.
Mea
culpa."
Langdon
looked
incredulous.
"Coming
from
you,
Leigh,
that
just
might
fly."
"Sir?"
the
pilot
called
back.
"The
tower
just
radioed.
They've
got
some
kind
of
maintenance
problem
out
near
your
hangar,
and
they're
asking
me
to
bring
the
plane
directly
to
the
terminal
instead."
Teabing
had
been
flying
to
Biggin
Hill
for
over
a
decade,
and
this
was
a
first.
"Did
they
mention
what
the
problem
is?"
"The
controller
was
vague.
Something
about
a
gas
leak
at
the
pumping
station?
They
asked
me
to
park
in
front
of
the
terminal
and
keep
everyone
onboard
until
further
notice.
Safety
precaution.
We're
not
supposed
to
deplane
until
we
get
the
all
clear
from
airport
authorities."
Teabing
was
skeptical.
Must
be
one
hell
of
a
gas
leak.
The
pumping
station
was
a
good
half
mile
from
his
hangar.
Remy
also
looked
concerned.
"Sir,
this
sounds
highly
irregular."
Teabing
turned
to
Sophie
and
Langdon.
"My
friends,
I
have
an
unpleasant
suspicion
that
we
are
about
to
be
met
by
a
welcoming
committee."
Langdon
gave
a
bleak
sigh.
"I
guess
Fache
still
thinks
I'm
his
man."
"Either
that,"
Sophie
said,
"or
he
is
too
deep
into
this
to
admit
his
error.
Teabing
was
not
listening.
Regardless
of
Fache's
mind
set,
action
needed
to
be
taken
fast.
Don't
lose
sight
of
the
ultimate
goal.
The
Grail.
We're
so
dose.
Below
them,
the
landing
gear
descended
with
a
clunk.
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
sounding
deeply
remorseful,
"I
should
turn
myself
in
and
sort
this
out
legally.
Leave
you
all
out
of
it.
"Oh,
heavens,
Robert!"
Teabing
waved
it
off.
"Do
you
really
think
they're
going
to
let
the
rest
of
us
go?
I
just
transported
you
illegally.
Miss
Neveu
assisted
in
your
escape
from
the
Louvre,
and
we
have
a
man
tied
up
in
the
back
of
the
plane.
Really
now!
We're
all
in
this
together."
"Maybe
a
different
airport?"
Sophie
said.
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"If
we
pull
up
now,
by
the
time
we
get
clearance
anywhere
else,
our
welcoming
party
will
include
army
tanks."
Sophie
slumped.
Teabing
sensed
that
if
they
were
to
have
any
chance
of
postponing
confrontation
with
the
British
authorities
long
enough
to
find
the
Grail,
bold
action
had
to
be
taken.
"Give
me
a
minute,"
he
said,
hobbling
toward
the
cockpit.
"What
are
you
doing?"
Langdon
asked.
"Sales
meeting,"
Teabing
said,
wondering
how
much
it
would
cost
him
to
persuade
his
pilot
to
perform
one
highly
irregular
maneuver.
The
Hawker
is
on
final
approach.
Simon
Edwards
Executive
Services
Officer
at
Biggin
Hill
Airport
paced
the
control
tower,
squinting
nervously
at
the
rain
drenched
runway.
He
never
appreciated
being
awoken
early
on
a
Saturday
morning,
but
it
was
particularly
distasteful
that
he
had
been
called
in
to
oversee
the
arrest
of
one
of
his
most
lucrative
clients.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
paid
Biggin
Hill
not
only
for
a
private
hangar
but
a
"per
landing
fee"
for
his
frequent
arrivals
and
departures.
Usually,
the
airfield
had
advance
warning
of
his
schedule
and
was
able
to
follow
a
strict
protocol
for
his
arrival.
Teabing
liked
things
just
so.
The
custom
built
Jaguar
stretch
limousine
that
he
kept
in
his
hangar
was
to
be
fully
gassed,
polished,
and
the
day's
London
Times
laid
out
on
the
back
seat.
A
customs
official
was
to
be
waiting
for
the
plane
at
the
hangar
to
expedite
the
mandatory
documentation
and
luggage
check.
Occasionally,
customs
agents
accepted
large
tips
from
Teabing
in
exchange
for
turning
a
blind
eye
to
the
transport
of
harmless
organics
mostly
luxury
foods
French
escargots,
a
particularly
ripe
unprocessed
Roquefort,
certain
fruits.
Many
customs
laws
were
absurd,
anyway,
and
if
Biggin
Hill
didn't
accommodate
its
clients,
certainly
competing
airfields
would.
Teabing
was
provided
with
what
he
wanted
here
at
Biggin
Hill,
and
the
employees
reaped
the
benefits.
Edwards's
nerves
felt
frayed
now
as
he
watched
the
jet
coming
in.
He
wondered
if
Teabing's
penchant
for
spreading
the
wealth
had
gotten
him
in
trouble
somehow;
the
French
authorities
seemed
very
intent
on
containing
him.
Edwards
had
not
yet
been
told
what
the
charges
were,
but
they
were
obviously
serious.
At
the
French
authorities'
request,
Kent
police
had
ordered
the
Biggin
Hill
air
traffic
controller
to
radio
the
Hawker's
pilot
and
order
him
directly
to
the
terminal
rather
than
to
the
client's
hangar.
The
pilot
had
agreed,
apparently
believing
the
far
fetched
story
of
a
gas
leak.
Though
the
British
police
did
not
generally
carry
weapons,
the
gravity
of
the
situation
had
brought
out
an
armed
response
team.
Now,
eight
policemen
with
handguns
stood
just
inside
the
terminal
building,
awaiting
the
moment
when
the
plane's
engines
powered
down.
The
instant
this
happened,
a
runway
attendant
would
place
safety
wedges
under
the
tires
so
the
plane
could
no
longer
move.
Then
the
police
would
step
into
view
and
hold
the
occupants
at
bay
until
the
French
police
arrived
to
handle
the
situation.
The
Hawker
was
low
in
the
sky
now,
skimming
the
treetops
to
their
right.
Simon
Edwards
went
downstairs
to
watch
the
landing
from
tarmac
level.
The
Kent
police
were
poised,
just
out
of
sight,
and
the
maintenance
man
waited
with
his
wedges.
Out
on
the
runway,
the
Hawker's
nose
tipped
up,
and
the
tires
touched
down
in
a
puff
of
smoke.
The
plane
settled
