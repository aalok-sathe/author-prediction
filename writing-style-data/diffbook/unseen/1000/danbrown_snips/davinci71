at
your
service.
What
is
it
I
can
tell
you?"
Langdon
sighed.
"I
was
hoping
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
explain
to
Ms.
Neveu
the
true
nature
of
the
Holy
Grail."
Teabing
looked
stunned.
"She
doesn't
know?"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
The
smile
that
grew
on
Teabing's
face
was
almost
obscene.
"Robert,
you've
brought
me
a
virgin?"
Langdon
winced,
glancing
at
Sophie.
"Virgin
is
the
term
Grail
enthusiasts
use
to
describe
anyone
who
has
never
heard
the
true
Grail
story."
Teabing
turned
eagerly
to
Sophie.
"How
much
do
you
know,
my
dear?"
Sophie
quickly
outlined
what
Langdon
had
explained
earlier
the
Priory
of
Sion,
the
Knights
Templar,
the
Sangreal
documents,
and
the
Holy
Grail,
which
many
claimed
was
not
a
cup
but
rather
something
far
more
powerful.
"That's
all?"
Teabing
fired
Langdon
a
scandalous
look.
"Robert,
I
thought
you
were
a
gentleman.
You've
robbed
her
of
the
climax!"
"I
know,
I
thought
perhaps
you
and
I
could"
Langdon
apparently
decided
the
unseemly
metaphor
had
gone
far
enough.
Teabing
already
had
Sophie
locked
in
his
twinkling
gaze.
"You
are
a
Grail
virgin,
my
dear.
And
trust
me,
you
will
never
forget
your
first
time."
Seated
on
the
divan
beside
Langdon,
Sophie
drank
her
tea
and
ate
a
scone,
feeling
the
welcome
effects
of
caffeine
and
food.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
was
beaming
as
he
awkwardly
paced
before
the
open
fire,
his
leg
braces
clicking
on
the
stone
hearth.
"The
Holy
Grail,"
Teabing
said,
his
voice
sermonic.
"Most
people
ask
me
only
where
it
is.
I
fear
that
is
a
question
I
may
never
answer."
He
turned
and
looked
directly
at
Sophie.
"However
the
far
more
relevant
question
is
this:
What
is
the
Holy
Grail?"
Sophie
sensed
a
rising
air
of
academic
anticipation
now
in
both
of
her
male
companions.
"To
fully
understand
the
Grail,"
Teabing
continued,
"we
must
first
understand
the
Bible.
How
well
do
you
know
the
New
Testament?"
Sophie
shrugged.
"Not
at
all,
really.
I
was
raised
by
a
man
who
worshipped
Leonardo
da
Vinci."
Teabing
looked
both
startled
and
pleased.
"An
enlightened
soul.
Superb!
Then
you
must
be
aware
that
Leonardo
was
one
of
the
keepers
of
the
secret
of
the
Holy
Grail.
And
he
hid
clues
in
his
art."
"Robert
told
me
as
much,
yes."
"And
Da
Vinci's
views
on
the
New
Testament?"
"I
have
no
idea."
Teabing's
eyes
turned
mirthful
as
he
motioned
to
the
bookshelf
across
the
room.
"Robert,
would
you
mind?
On
the
bottom
shelf.
La
Storia
di
Leonardo.
Langdon
went
across
the
room,
found
a
large
art
book,
and
brought
it
back,
setting
it
down
on
the
table
between
them.
Twisting
the
book
to
face
Sophie,
Teabing
flipped
open
the
heavy
cover
and
pointed
inside
the
rear
cover
to
a
series
of
quotations.
"From
Da
Vinci's
notebook
on
polemics
and
speculation,"
Teabing
said,
indicating
one
quote
in
particular.
"I
think
you'll
find
this
relevant
to
our
discussion."
Sophie
read
the
words.
Many
have
made
a
trade
of
delusions
and
false
miracles,
deceiving
the
stupid
multitude.
LEONARDO
DA
VINCI
"Here's
another,"
Teabing
said,
pointing
to
a
different
quote.
Blinding
ignorance
does
mislead
us.
01
Wretched
mortals,
open
your
eyes!
LEONARDO
DA
VINCI
Sophie
felt
a
little
chill.
"Da
Vinci
is
talking
about
the
Bible?"
Teabing
nodded.
"Leonardo's
feelings
about
the
Bible
relate
directly
to
the
Holy
Grail.
In
fact,
Da
Vinci
painted
the
true
Grail,
which
I
will
show
you
momentarily,
but
first
we
must
speak
of
the
Bible."
Teabing
smiled.
"And
everything
you
need
to
know
about
the
Bible
can
be
summed
up
by
the
great
canon
doctor
Martyn
Percy."
Teabing
cleared
his
throat
and
declared,
"The
Bible
did
not
arrive
by
fax
from
heaven."
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"The
Bible
is
a
product
of
man,
my
dear.
Not
of
God.
The
Bible
did
not
fall
magically
from
the
clouds.
Man
created
it
as
a
historical
record
of
tumultuous
times,
and
it
has
evolved
through
countless
translations,
additions,
and
revisions.
History
has
never
had
a
definitive
version
of
the
book."
"Okay."
"Jesus
Christ
was
a
historical
figure
of
staggering
influence,
perhaps
the
most
enigmatic
and
inspirational
leader
the
world
has
ever
seen.
As
the
prophesied
Messiah,
Jesus
toppled
kings,
inspired
millions,
and
founded
new
philosophies.
As
a
descendant
of
the
lines
of
King
Solomon
and
King
David,
Jesus
possessed
a
rightful
claim
to
the
throne
of
the
King
of
the
Jews.
Understandably,
His
life
was
recorded
by
thousands
of
followers
across
the
land."
Teabing
paused
to
sip
his
tea
and
then
placed
the
cup
back
on
the
mantel.
"More
than
eighty
gospels
were
considered
for
the
New
Testament,
and
yet
only
a
relative
few
were
chosen
for
inclusion
Matthew,
Mark,
Luke,
and
John
among
them.
"Who
chose
which
gospels
to
include?"
Sophie
asked.
"Aha!"
Teabing
burst
in
with
enthusiasm.
"The
fundamental
irony
of
Christianity!
The
Bible,
as
we
know
it
today,
was
collated
by
the
pagan
Roman
emperor
Constantine
the
Great."
"I
thought
Constantine
was
a
Christian,"
Sophie
said.
"Hardly,"
Teabing
scoffed.
"He
was
a
lifelong
pagan
who
was
baptized
on
his
deathbed,
too
weak
to
protest.
In
Constantine's
day,
Rome's
official
religion
was
sun
worship
the
cult
of
Sol
Invictus,
or
the
Invincible
Sun
and
Constantine
was
its
head
priest.
Unfortunately
for
him,
a
growing
religious
turmoil
was
gripping
Rome.
Three
centuries
after
the
crucifixion
of
Jesus
Christ,
Christ's
followers
had
multiplied
exponentially.
Christians
and
pagans
began
warring,
and
the
conflict
grew
to
such
proportions
that
it
threatened
to
rend
Rome
in
two.
Constantine
decided
something
had
to
be
done.
In
325
A.D.,
he
decided
to
unify
Rome
under
a
single
religion.
Christianity."
Sophie
was
surprised.
"Why
would
a
pagan
emperor
choose
Christianity
as
the
official
religion?"
Teabing
chuckled.
"Constantine
was
a
very
good
businessman.
He
could
see
that
Christianity
was
on
the
rise,
and
he
simply
backed
the
winning
horse.
Historians
still
marvel
at
the
brilliance
with
which
Constantine
converted
the
sun
worshipping
pagans
to
Christianity.
By
fusing
pagan
symbols,
dates,
and
rituals
into
the
growing
Christian
tradition,
he
created
a
