had
been
on
his
mind.
"I
think
I
know
part
of
the
reason
why
your
grandfather
conspired
to
put
us
together.
I
think
there's
something
he
wanted
me
to
explain
to
you."
"The
history
of
the
Holy
Grail
and
Mary
Magdalene
isn't
enough?"
Langdon
felt
uncertain
how
to
proceed.
"The
rift
between
you.
The
reason
you
haven't
spoken
to
him
in
ten
years.
I
think
maybe
he
was
hoping
I
could
somehow
make
that
right
by
explaining
what
drove
you
apart."
Sophie
squirmed
in
her
seat.
"I
haven't
told
you
what
drove
us
apart."
Langdon
eyed
her
carefully.
"You
witnessed
a
sex
rite.
Didn't
you?"
Sophie
recoiled.
"How
do
you
know
that?"
"Sophie,
you
told
me
you
witnessed
something
that
convinced
you
your
grandfather
was
in
a
secret
society.
And
whatever
you
saw
upset
you
enough
that
you
haven't
spoken
to
him
since.
I
know
a
fair
amount
about
secret
societies.
It
doesn't
take
the
brains
of
Da
Vinci
to
guess
what
you
saw."
Sophie
stared.
"Was
it
in
the
spring?"
Langdon
asked.
"Sometime
around
the
equinox?
Mid
March?"
Sophie
looked
out
the
window.
"I
was
on
spring
break
from
university.
I
came
home
a
few
days
early."
"You
want
to
tell
me
about
it?"
"I'd
rather
not."
She
turned
suddenly
back
to
Langdon,
her
eyes
welling
with
emotion.
"I
don't
know
what
I
saw."
"Were
both
men
and
women
present?"
After
a
beat,
she
nodded.
"Dressed
in
white
and
black?"
She
wiped
her
eyes
and
then
nodded,
seeming
to
open
up
a
little.
"The
women
were
in
white
gossamer
gowns
with
golden
shoes.
They
held
golden
orbs.
The
men
wore
black
tunics
and
black
shoes."
Langdon
strained
to
hide
his
emotion,
and
yet
he
could
not
believe
what
he
was
hearing.
Sophie
Neveu
had
unwittingly
witnessed
a
two
thousand
year
old
sacred
ceremony.
"Masks?"
he
asked,
keeping
his
voice
calm.
"Androgynous
masks?"
"Yes.
Everyone.
Identical
masks.
White
on
the
women.
Black
on
the
men."
Langdon
had
read
descriptions
of
this
ceremony
and
understood
its
mystic
roots.
"It's
called
Hieros
Gamos,"
he
said
softly.
"It
dates
back
more
than
two
thousand
years.
Egyptian
priests
and
priestesses
performed
it
regularly
to
celebrate
the
reproductive
power
of
the
female,"
He
paused,
leaning
toward
her.
"And
if
you
witnessed
Hieros
Gamos
without
being
properly
prepared
to
understand
its
meaning,
I
imagine
it
would
be
pretty
shocking."
Sophie
said
nothing.
"Hieros
Gamos
is
Greek,"
he
continued.
"It
means
sacred
marriage.
"The
ritual
I
saw
was
no
marriage."
"Marriage
as
in
union,
Sophie."
"You
mean
as
in
sex."
"No."
"No?"
she
said,
her
olive
eyes
testing
him.
Langdon
backpedaled.
"Well
yes,
in
a
manner
of
speaking,
but
not
as
we
understand
it
today."
He
explained
that
although
what
she
saw
probably
looked
like
a
sex
ritual,
Hieros
Gamos
had
nothing
to
do
with
eroticism.
It
was
a
spiritual
act.
Historically,
intercourse
was
the
act
through
which
male
and
female
experienced
God.
The
ancients
believed
that
the
male
was
spiritually
incomplete
until
he
had
carnal
knowledge
of
the
sacred
feminine.
Physical
union
with
the
female
remained
the
sole
means
through
which
man
could
become
spiritually
complete
and
ultimately
achieve
gnosis
knowledge
of
the
divine.
Since
the
days
of
Isis,
sex
rites
had
been
considered
man's
only
bridge
from
earth
to
heaven.
"By
communing
with
woman,"
Langdon
said,
"man
could
achieve
a
climactic
instant
when
his
mind
went
totally
blank
and
he
could
see
God.
Sophie
looked
skeptical.
"Orgasm
as
prayer?"
Langdon
gave
a
noncommittal
shrug,
although
Sophie
was
essentially
correct.
Physiologically
speaking,
the
male
climax
was
accompanied
by
a
split
second
entirely
devoid
of
thought.
A
brief
mental
vacuum.
A
moment
of
clarity
during
which
God
could
be
glimpsed.
Meditation
gurus
achieved
similar
states
of
thoughtlessness
without
sex
and
often
described
Nirvana
as
a
never
ending
spiritual
orgasm.
"Sophie,"
Langdon
said
quietly,
"it's
important
to
remember
that
the
ancients'
view
of
sex
was
entirely
opposite
from
ours
today.
Sex
begot
new
life
the
ultimate
miracle
and
miracles
could
be
performed
only
by
a
god.
The
ability
of
the
woman
to
produce
life
from
her
womb
made
her
sacred.
A
god.
Intercourse
was
the
revered
union
of
the
two
halves
of
the
human
spirit
male
and
female
through
which
the
male
could
find
spiritual
wholeness
and
communion
with
God.
What
you
saw
was
not
about
sex,
it
was
about
spirituality.
The
Hieros
Gamos
ritual
is
not
a
perversion.
It's
a
deeply
sacrosanct
ceremony."
His
words
seemed
to
strike
a
nerve.
Sophie
had
been
remarkably
poised
all
evening,
but
now,
for
the
first
time,
Langdon
saw
the
aura
of
composure
beginning
to
crack.
Tears
materialized
in
her
eyes
again,
and
she
dabbed
them
away
with
her
sleeve.
He
gave
her
a
moment.
Admittedly,
the
concept
of
sex
as
a
pathway
to
God
was
mind
boggling
at
first.
Langdon's
Jewish
students
always
looked
flabbergasted
when
he
first
told
them
that
the
early
Jewish
tradition
involved
ritualistic
sex.
In
the
Temple,
no
less.
Early
Jews
believed
that
the
Holy
of
Holies
in
Solomon's
Temple
housed
not
only
God
but
also
His
powerful
female
equal,
Shekinah.
Men
seeking
spiritual
wholeness
came
to
the
Temple
to
visit
priestesses
or
hierodules
with
whom
they
made
love
and
experienced
the
divine
through
physical
union.
The
Jewish
tetragrammaton
YHWH
the
sacred
name
of
God
in
fact
derived
from
Jehovah,
an
androgynous
physical
union
between
the
masculine
Jah
and
the
pre
Hebraic
name
for
Eve,
Havah.
"For
the
early
Church,"
Langdon
explained
in
a
soft
voice,
"mankind's
use
of
sex
to
commune
directly
with
God
posed
a
serious
threat
to
the
Catholic
power
base.
It
left
the
Church
out
of
the
loop,
undermining
their
selfproclaimed
status
as
the
sole
conduit
to
God.
For
obvious
reasons,
they
worked
hard
to
demonize
sex
and
recast
it
as
a
disgusting
and
sinful
act.
Other
major
religions
did
the
same."
Sophie
was
silent,
but
Langdon
sensed
she
was
starting
to
understand
her
grandfather
better.
Ironically,
Langdon
had
made
this
same
point
in
a
class
lecture
earlier
this
semester.
"Is
it
