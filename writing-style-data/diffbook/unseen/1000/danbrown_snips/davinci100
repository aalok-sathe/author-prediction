evidence
bags
on
the
desk.
"And
this?"
The
man
shrugged.
"Force
of
habit.
I
bag
anything
peculiar."
Collet
walked
over.
Peculiar?
"This
Brit's
a
strange
one,"
the
examiner
said.
"Have
a
look
at
this."
He
sifted
through
the
evidence
bags
and
selected
one,
handing
it
to
Collet.
The
photo
showed
the
main
entrance
of
a
Gothic
cathedral
the
traditional,
recessed
archway,
narrowing
through
multiple,
ribbed
layers
to
a
small
doorway.
Collet
studied
the
photo
and
turned.
"This
is
peculiar?"
"Turn
it
over."
On
the
back,
Collet
found
notations
scrawled
in
English,
describing
a
cathedral's
long
hollow
nave
as
a
secret
pagan
tribute
to
a
woman's
womb.
This
was
strange.
The
notation
describing
the
cathedral's
doorway,
however,
was
what
startled
him.
"Hold
on!
He
thinks
a
cathedral's
entrance
represents
a
woman's"
The
examiner
nodded.
"Complete
with
receding
labial
ridges
and
a
nice
little
cinquefoil
clitoris
above
the
doorway."
He
sighed.
"Kind
of
makes
you
want
to
go
back
to
church."
Collet
picked
up
the
second
evidence
bag.
Through
the
plastic,
he
could
see
a
large
glossy
photograph
of
what
appeared
to
be
an
old
document.
The
heading
at
the
top
read:
Les
Dossiers
Secrets
Number
4
Im
1
249
"What's
this?"
Collet
asked.
"No
idea.
He's
got
copies
of
it
all
over
the
place,
so
I
bagged
it."
Collet
studied
the
document.

Prieure

?
Collet
wondered.
"Lieutenant?"
Another
agent
stuck
his
head
in.
"The
switchboard
has
an
urgent
call
for
Captain
Fache,
but
they
can't
reach
him.
Will
you
take
it?"
Collet
returned
to
the
kitchen
and
took
the
call.
It
was
Andre
Vernet.
The
banker's
refined
accent
did
little
to
mask
the
tension
in
his
voice.
"I
thought
Captain
Fache
said
he
would
call
me,
but
I
have
not
yet
heard
from
him."
"The
captain
is
quite
busy,"
Collet
replied.
"May
I
help
you?"
"I
was
assured
I
would
be
kept
abreast
of
your
progress
tonight."
For
a
moment,
Collet
thought
he
recognized
the
timbre
of
the
man's
voice,
but
he
couldn't
quite
place
it.
"Monsieur
Vernet,
I
am
currently
in
charge
of
the
Paris
investigation.
My
name
is
Lieutenant
Collet."
There
was
a
long
pause
on
the
line.
"Lieutenant,
I
have
another
call
coming
in.
Please
excuse
me.
I
will
call
you
later."
He
hung
up.
For
several
seconds,
Collet
held
the
receiver.
Then
it
dawned
on
him.
knew
I
recognized
that
voice!
The
revelation
made
him
gasp.
The
armored
car
driver.
With
the
fake
Rolex.
Collet
now
understood
why
the
banker
had
hung
up
so
quickly.
Vernet
had
remembered
the
name
Lieutenant
Collet
the
officer
he
blatantly
lied
to
earlier
tonight.
Collet
pondered
the
implications
of
this
bizarre
development.
Vernet
is
involved.
Instinctively,
he
knew
he
should
call
Fache.
Emotionally,
he
knew
this
lucky
break
was
going
to
be
his
moment
to
shine.
He
immediately
called
Interpol
and
requested
every
shred
of
information
they
could
find
on
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
and
its
president,
Andre
Vernet.
"Seat
belts,
please,"
Teabing's
pilot
announced
as
the
Hawker
731
descended
into
a
gloomy
morning
drizzle.
"We'll
be
landing
in
five
minutes."
Teabing
felt
a
joyous
sense
of
homecoming
when
he
saw
the
misty
hills
of
Kent
spreading
wide
beneath
the
descending
plane.
England
was
less
than
an
hour
from
Paris,
and
yet
a
world
away.
This
morning,
the
damp,
spring
green
of
his
homeland
looked
particularly
welcoming.
My
time
in
France
is
over.
I
am
returning
to
England
victorious.
The
keystone
has
been
found.
The
question
remained,
of
course,
as
to
where
the
keystone
would
ultimately
lead.
Somewhere
in
the
United
Kingdom.
Where
exactly,
Teabing
had
no
idea,
but
he
was
already
tasting
the
glory.
As
Langdon
and
Sophie
looked
on,
Teabing
got
up
and
went
to
the
far
side
of
the
cabin,
then
slid
aside
a
wall
panel
to
reveal
a
discreetly
hidden
wall
safe.
He
dialed
in
the
combination,
opened
the
safe,
and
extracted
two
passports.
"Documentation
for
Rimy
and
myself."
He
then
removed
a
thick
stack
of
fifty
pound
notes.
"And
documentation
for
you
two."
Sophie
looked
leery.
"A
bribe?"
"Creative
diplomacy.
Executive
airfields
make
certain
allowances.
A
British
customs
official
will
greet
us
at
my
hangar
and
ask
to
board
the
plane.
Rather
than
permitting
him
to
come
on,
I'll
tell
him
I'm
traveling
with
a
French
celebrity
who
prefers
that
nobody
knows
she
is
in
England
press
considerations,
you
know
and
I'll
offer
the
official
this
generous
tip
as
gratitude
for
his
discretion."
Langdon
looked
amazed.
"And
the
official
will
accept?"
"Not
from
anyone,
they
won't,
but
these
people
all
know
me.
I'm
not
an
arms
dealer,
for
heaven's
sake.
I
was
knighted."
Teabing
smiled.
"Membership
has
its
privileges."
Remy
approached
up
the
aisle
now,
the
Heckler
Koch
pistol
cradled
in
his
hand.
"Sir,
my
agenda?"
Teabing
glanced
at
his
servant.
"I'm
going
to
have
you
stay
onboard
with
our
guest
until
we
return.
We
can't
very
well
drag
him
all
over
London
with
us."
Sophie
looked
wary.
"Leigh,
I
was
serious
about
the
French
police
finding
your
plane
before
we
return.
Teabing
laughed.
"Yes,
imagine
their
surprise
if
they
board
and
find
Remy."
Sophie
looked
surprised
by
his
cavalier
attitude.
"Leigh,
you
transported
a
bound
hostage
across
international
borders.
This
is
serious."
"So
are
