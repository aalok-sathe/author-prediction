crafted
of
interconnecting
lettered
dials.
The
device
seemed
surprisingly
familiar
to
him.
"Designed
from
Da
Vinci's
diaries,"
Sophie
said.
"My
grandfather
made
them
as
a
hobby."
Of
course,
Teabing
realized.
He
had
seen
the
sketches
and
blueprints.
The
key
to
finding
the
Holy
Grail
lies
inside
this
stone.
Teabing
lifted
the
heavy
cryptex
from
the
box,
holding
it
gently.
Although
he
had
no
idea
how
to
open
the
cylinder,
he
sensed
his
own
destiny
lay
inside.
In
moments
of
failure,
Teabing
had
questioned
whether
his
life's
quest
would
ever
be
rewarded.
Now
those
doubts
were
gone
forever.
He
could
hear
the
ancient
words
the
foundation
of
the
Grail
legend:
Vous
ne
trouvezpas
le
Saint
Graal,
c'est
le
Saint
Graal
qui
vous
trouve.
You
do
not
find
the
Grail,
the
Grail
finds
you.
And
tonight,
incredibly,
the
key
to
finding
the
Holy
Grail
had
walked
right
through
his
front
door.
While
Sophie
and
Teabing
sat
with
the
cryptex
and
talked
about
the
vinegar,
the
dials,
and
what
the
password
might
be,
Langdon
carried
the
rosewood
box
across
the
room
to
a
well
lit
table
to
get
a
better
look
at
it.
Something
Teabing
had
just
said
was
now
running
through
Langdon's
mind.
The
key
to
the
Grail
is
hidden
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
Langdon
held
the
wooden
box
up
to
the
light
and
examined
the
inlaid
symbol
of
the
Rose.
Although
his
familiarity
with
art
did
not
include
woodworking
or
inlaid
furniture,
he
had
just
recalled
the
famous
tiled
ceiling
of
the
Spanish
monastery
outside
of
Madrid,
where,
three
centuries
after
its
construction,
the
ceiling
tiles
began
to
fall
out,
revealing
sacred
texts
scrawled
by
monks
on
the
plaster
beneath.
Langdon
looked
again
at
the
Rose.
Beneath
the
Rose.
Sub
Rosa.
Secret.
A
bump
in
the
hallway
behind
him
made
Langdon
turn.
He
saw
nothing
but
shadows.
Teabing's
manservant
most
likely
had
passed
through.
Langdon
turned
back
to
the
box.
He
ran
his
finger
over
the
smooth
edge
of
the
inlay,
wondering
if
he
could
pry
the
Rose
out,
but
the
craftsmanship
was
perfect.
He
doubted
even
a
razor
blade
could
fit
in
between
the
inlaid
Rose
and
the
carefully
carved
depression
into
which
it
was
seated.
Opening
the
box,
he
examined
the
inside
of
the
lid.
It
was
smooth.
As
he
shifted
its
position,
though,
the
light
caught
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
hole
on
the
underside
of
the
lid,
positioned
in
the
exact
center.
Langdon
closed
the
lid
and
examined
the
inlaid
symbol
from
the
top.
No
hole.
It
doesn
't
pass
through.
Setting
the
box
on
the
table,
he
looked
around
the
room
and
spied
a
stack
of
papers
with
a
paper
clip
on
it.
Borrowing
the
clip,
he
returned
to
the
box,
opened
it,
and
studied
the
hole
again.
Carefully,
he
unbent
the
paper
clip
and
inserted
one
end
into
the
hole.
He
gave
a
gentle
push.
It
took
almost
no
effort.
He
heard
something
clatter
quietly
onto
the
table.
Langdon
closed
the
lid
to
look.
It
was
a
small
piece
of
wood,
like
a
puzzle
piece.
The
wooden
Rose
had
popped
out
of
the
lid
and
fallen
onto
the
desk.
Speechless,
Langdon
stared
at
the
bare
spot
on
the
lid
where
the
Rose
had
been.
There,
engraved
in
the
wood,
written
in
an
immaculate
hand,
were
four
lines
of
text
in
a
language
he
had
never
seen.
The
characters
look
vaguely
Semitic,
Langdon
thought
to
himself,
and
yet
I
don
't
recognize
the
language!
A
sudden
movement
behind
him
caught
his
attention.
Out
of
nowhere,
a
crushing
blow
to
the
head
knocked
Langdon
to
his
knees.
As
he
fell,
he
thought
for
a
moment
he
saw
a
pale
ghost
hovering
over
him,
clutching
a
gun.
Then
everything
went
black.
Sophie
Neveu,
despite
working
in
law
enforcement,
had
never
found
herself
at
gunpoint
until
tonight.
Almost
inconceivably,
the
gun
into
which
she
was
now
staring
was
clutched
in
the
pale
hand
of
an
enormous
albino
with
long
white
hair.
He
looked
at
her
with
red
eyes
that
radiated
a
frightening,
disembodied
quality.
Dressed
in
a
wool
robe
with
a
rope
tie,
he
resembled
a
medieval
cleric.
Sophie
could
not
imagine
who
he
was,
and
yet
she
was
feeling
a
sudden
newfound
respect
for
Teabing's
suspicions
that
the
Church
was
behind
this.
"You
know
what
I
have
come
for,"
the
monk
said,
his
voice
hollow.
Sophie
and
Teabing
were
seated
on
the
divan,
arms
raised
as
their
attacker
had
commanded.
Langdon
lay
groaning
on
the
floor.
The
monk's
eyes
fell
immediately
to
the
keystone
on
Teabing's
lap.
Teabing's
tone
was
defiant.
"You
will
not
be
able
to
open
it."
"My
Teacher
is
very
wise,"
the
monk
replied,
inching
closer,
the
gun
shifting
between
Teabing
and
Sophie.
Sophie
wondered
where
Teabing's
manservant
was.
Didn't
he
hear
Robert
fall?
"Who
is
your
teacher?"
Teabing
asked.
"Perhaps
we
can
make
a
financial
arrangement."
"The
Grail
is
priceless."
He
moved
closer.
"You're
bleeding,"
Teabing
noted
calmly,
nodding
to
the
monk's
right
ankle
where
a
trickle
of
blood
had
run
down
his
leg.
"And
you're
limping."
"As
do
you,"
the
monk
replied,
motioning
to
the
metal
crutches
propped
beside
Teabing.
"Now,
hand
me
the
keystone."
"You
know
of
the
keystone?"
Teabing
said,
sounding
surprised.
"Never
mind
what
I
know.
Stand
up
slowly,
and
give
it
to
me."
"Standing
is
difficult
for
me."
"Precisely.
I
would
prefer
nobody
attempt
any
quick
moves."
Teabing
slipped
his
right
hand
through
one
of
his
crutches
and
grasped
the
keystone
in
his
left.
Lurching
to
his
feet,
he
stood
erect,
palming
the
heavy
cylinder
in
his
left
hand,
and
leaning
unsteadily
on
his
crutch
with
his
right.
The
monk
closed
to
within
a
few
feet,
keeping
the
gun
aimed
directly
at
Teabing's
head.
Sophie
watched,
feeling
helpless
as
the
monk
reached
out
to
take
the
cylinder.
"You
will
not
succeed,"
Teabing
said.
"Only
the
worthy
can
unlock
this
stone."
God
alone
judges
the
worthy,
Silas
thought.
"It's
quite
heavy,"
the
man
on
crutches
said,
his
