elegant
storefronts
on
Champs
Ely
sees.
"How
much
cash
do
you
have?"
Langdon
checked
his
wallet.
"A
hundred
dollars.
A
few
euro.
Why?"
"Credit
cards?"
"Of
course."
As
Sophie
accelerated,
Langdon
sensed
she
was
formulating
a
plan.
Dead
ahead,
at
the
end
of
Champs
Elysees,
stood
the
Arc
de
Triomphe
Napoleon's
164
foot
tall
tribute
to
his
own
military
potency
encircled
by
France's
largest
rotary,
a
nine
lane
behemoth.
Sophie's
eyes
were
on
the
rearview
mirror
again
as
they
approached
the
rotary.
"We
lost
them
for
the
time
being,"
she
said,
"but
we
won't
last
another
five
minutes
if
we
stay
in
this
car."
So
steal
a
different
one,
Langdon
mused,
now
that
we're
criminals.
"What
are
you
going
to
do?"
Sophie
gunned
the
SmartCar
into
the
rotary.
"Trust
me."
Langdon
made
no
response.
Trust
had
not
gotten
him
very
far
this
evening.
Pulling
back
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket,
he
checked
his
watch
a
vintage,
collector's
edition
Mickey
Mouse
wristwatch
that
had
been
a
gift
from
his
parents
on
his
tenth
birthday.
Although
its
juvenile
dial
often
drew
odd
looks,
Langdon
had
never
owned
any
other
watch;
Disney
animations
had
been
his
first
introduction
to
the
magic
of
form
and
color,
and
Mickey
now
served
as
Langdon's
daily
reminder
to
stay
young
at
heart.
At
the
moment,
however,
Mickey's
arms
were
skewed
at
an
awkward
angle,
indicating
an
equally
awkward
hour.
2:51A.M.
"Interesting
watch,"
Sophie
said,
glancing
at
his
wrist
and
maneuvering
the
SmartCar
around
the
wide,
counterclockwise
rotary.
"Long
story,"
he
said,
pulling
his
sleeve
back
down.
"I
imagine
it
would
have
to
be."
She
gave
him
a
quick
smile
and
exited
the
rotary,
heading
due
north,
away
from
the
city
center.
Barely
making
two
green
lights,
she
reached
the
third
intersection
and
took
a
hard
right
onto
Boulevard
Malesherbes.
They'd
left
the
rich,
tree
lined
streets
of
the
diplomatic
neighborhood
and
plunged
into
a
darker
industrial
neighborhood.
Sophie
took
a
quick
left,
and
a
moment
later,
Langdon
realized
where
they
were.
Gare
Saint
Lazare.
Ahead
of
them,
the
glass
roofed
train
terminal
resembled
the
awkward
offspring
of
an
airplane
hangar
and
a
greenhouse.
European
train
stations
never
slept.
Even
at
this
hour,
a
half
dozen
taxis
idled
near
the
main
entrance.
Vendors
manned
carts
of
sandwiches
and
mineral
water
while
grungy
kids
in
backpacks
emerged
from
the
station
rubbing
their
eyes,
looking
around
as
if
trying
to
remember
what
city
they
were
in
now.
Up
ahead
on
the
street,
a
couple
of
city
policemen
stood
on
the
curb
giving
directions
to
some
confused
tourists.
Sophie
pulled
her
SmartCar
in
behind
the
line
of
taxis
and
parked
in
a
red
zone
despite
plenty
of
legal
parking
across
the
street.
Before
Langdon
could
ask
what
was
going
on,
she
was
out
of
the
car.
She
hurried
to
the
window
of
the
taxi
in
front
of
them
and
began
speaking
to
the
driver.
As
Langdon
got
out
of
the
SmartCar,
he
saw
Sophie
hand
the
taxi
driver
a
big
wad
of
cash.
The
taxi
driver
nodded
and
then,
to
Langdon's
bewilderment,
sped
off
without
them.
"What
happened?"
Langdon
demanded,
joining
Sophie
on
the
curb
as
the
taxi
disappeared.
Sophie
was
already
heading
for
the
train
station
entrance.
"Come
on.
We're
buying
two
tickets
on
the
next
train
out
of
Paris."
Langdon
hurried
along
beside
her.
What
had
begun
as
a
one
mile
dash
to
the
U.S.
Embassy
had
now
become
a
full
fledged
evacuation
from
Paris.
Langdon
was
liking
this
idea
less
and
less.
The
driver
who
collected
Bishop
Aringarosa
from
Leonardo
da
Vinci
International
Airport
pulled
up
in
a
small,
unimpressive
black
Fiat
sedan.
Aringarosa
recalled
a
day
when
all
Vatican
transports
were
big
luxury
cars
that
sported
grille
plate
medallions
and
flags
emblazoned
with
the
seal
of
the
Holy
See.
Those
days
are
gone.
Vatican
cars
were
now
less
ostentatious
and
almost
always
unmarked.
The
Vatican
claimed
this
was
to
cut
costs
to
better
serve
their
dioceses,
but
Aringarosa
suspected
it
was
more
of
a
security
measure.
The
world
had
gone
mad,
and
in
many
parts
of
Europe,
advertising
your
love
of
Jesus
Christ
was
like
painting
a
bull's
eye
on
the
roof
of
your
car.
Bundling
his
black
cassock
around
himself,
Aringarosa
climbed
into
the
back
seat
and
settled
in
for
the
long
drive
to
Castel
Gandolfo.
It
would
be
the
same
ride
he
had
taken
five
months
ago.
Last
year's
trip
to
Rome,
he
sighed.
The
longest
night
of
my
life.
Five
months
ago,
the
Vatican
had
phoned
to
request
Aringarosa's
immediate
presence
in
Rome.
They
offered
no
explanation.
Your
tickets
are
at
the
airport.
The
Holy
See
worked
hard
to
retain
a
veil
of
mystery,
even
for
its
highest
clergy.
The
mysterious
summons,
Aringarosa
suspected,
was
probably
a
photo
opportunity
for
the
Pope
and
other
Vatican
officials
to
piggyback
on
Opus
Dei's
recent
public
success
the
completion
of
their
World
Headquarters
in
New
York
City.
Architectural
Digest
had
called
Opus
Dei's
building
"a
shining
beacon
of
Catholicism
sublimely
integrated
with
the
modern
landscape,"
and
lately
the
Vatican
seemed
to
be
drawn
to
anything
and
everything
that
included
the
word
"modern."
Aringarosa
had
no
choice
but
to
accept
the
invitation,
albeit
reluctantly.
Not
a
fan
of
the
current
papal
administration,
Aringarosa,
like
most
conservative
clergy,
had
watched
with
grave
concern
as
the
new
Pope
settled
into
his
first
year
in
office.
An
unprecedented
liberal,
His
Holiness
had
secured
the
papacy
through
one
of
the
most
controversial
and
unusual
conclaves
in
Vatican
history.
Now,
rather
than
being
humbled
by
his
unexpected
rise
to
power,
the
Holy
Father
had
wasted
no
time
flexing
all
the
muscle
associated
with
the
highest
office
in
Christendom.
Drawing
on
an
unsettling
tide
of
liberal
support
within
the
College
of
Cardinals,
the
Pope
was
now
declaring
his
papal
mission
to
be
"rejuvenation
of
Vatican
doctrine
and
updating
Catholicism
into
the
third
millennium."
The
translation,
Aringarosa
feared,
was
that
the
man
was
actually
arrogant
enough
to
think
he
could
rewrite
God's
laws
and
win
