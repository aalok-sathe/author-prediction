the
home
of
Leigh
Teabing?
That
I
happen
to
live
there
is
why
the
Teacher
approached
me
in
the
first
place."
He
paused.
"How
do
you
think
the
Teacher
knows
so
much
about
the
Grail?"
Now
it
dawned,
and
Silas
was
stunned.
The
Teacher
had
recruited
a
servant
who
had
access
to
all
of
Sir
Leigh
Teabing's
research.
It
was
brilliant.
"There
is
much
I
have
to
tell
you,"
Remy
said,
handing
Silas
the
loaded
Heckler
Koch
pistol.
Then
he
reached
through
the
open
partition
and
retrieved
a
small,
palm
sized
revolver
from
the
glove
box.
"But
first,
you
and
I
have
a
job
to
do."
Captain
Fache
descended
from
his
transport
plane
at
Biggin
Hill
and
listened
in
disbelief
to
the
Kent
chief
inspector's
account
of
what
had
happened
in
Teabing's
hangar.
"I
searched
the
plane
myself,"
the
inspector
insisted,
"and
there
was
no
one
inside."
His
tone
turned
haughty.
"And
I
should
add
that
if
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
presses
charges
against
me,
I
will
"Did
you
interrogate
the
pilot?"
"Of
course
not.
He
is
French,
and
our
jurisdiction
requires
"Take
me
to
the
plane."
Arriving
at
the
hangar,
Fache
needed
only
sixty
seconds
to
locate
an
anomalous
smear
of
blood
on
the
pavement
near
where
the
limousine
had
been
parked.
Fache
walked
up
to
the
plane
and
rapped
loudly
on
the
fuselage.
"This
is
the
captain
of
the
French
Judicial
Police.
Open
the
door!"
The
terrified
pilot
opened
the
hatch
and
lowered
the
stairs.
Fache
ascended.
Three
minutes
later,
with
the
help
of
his
sidearm,
he
had
a
full
confession,
including
a
description
of
the
bound
albino
monk.
In
addition,
he
learned
that
the
pilot
saw
Langdon
and
Sophie
leave
something
behind
in
Teabing's
safe,
a
wooden
box
of
some
sort.
Although
the
pilot
denied
knowing
what
was
in
the
box,
he
admitted
it
had
been
the
focus
of
Langdon's
full
attention
during
the
flight
to
London.
"Open
the
safe,"
Fache
demanded.
The
pilot
looked
terrified.
"I
don't
know
the
combination!"
"That's
too
bad.
I
was
going
to
offer
to
let
you
keep
your
pilot's
license."
The
pilot
wrung
his
hands.
"I
know
some
men
in
maintenance
here.
Maybe
they
could
drill
it?"
"You
have
half
an
hour."
The
pilot
leapt
for
his
radio.
Fache
strode
to
the
back
of
the
plane
and
poured
himself
a
hard
drink.
It
was
early,
but
he
had
not
yet
slept,
so
this
hardly
counted
as
drinking
before
noon.
Sitting
in
a
plush
bucket
seat,
he
closed
his
eyes,
trying
to
sort
out
what
was
going
on.
The
Kent
police's
blunder
could
cost
me
dearly.
Everyone
was
now
on
the
lookout
for
a
black
Jaguar
limousine.
Fache's
phone
rang,
and
he
wished
for
a
moment's
peace.
"Alio?"
"I'm
en
route
to
London."
It
was
Bishop
Aringarosa.
"I'll
be
arriving
in
an
hour."
Fache
sat
up.
"I
thought
you
were
going
to
Paris."
"I
am
deeply
concerned.
I
have
changed
my
plans."
"You
should
not
have."
"Do
you
have
Silas?"
"No.
His
captors
eluded
the
local
police
before
I
landed."
Aringarosa's
anger
rang
sharply.
"You
assured
me
you
would
stop
that
plane!"
Fache
lowered
his
voice.
"Bishop,
considering
your
situation,
I
recommend
you
not
test
my
patience
today.
I
will
find
Silas
and
the
others
as
soon
as
possible.
Where
are
you
landing?"
"One
moment."
Aringarosa
covered
the
receiver
and
then
came
back.
"The
pilot
is
trying
to
get
clearance
at
Heathrow.
I'm
his
only
passenger,
but
our
redirect
was
unscheduled."
"Tell
him
to
come
to
Biggin
Hill
Executive
Airport
in
Kent.
I'll
get
him
clearance.
If
I'm
not
here
when
you
land,
I'll
have
a
car
waiting
for
you.
"Thank
you."
"As
I
expressed
when
we
first
spoke,
Bishop,
you
would
do
well
to
remember
that
you
are
not
the
only
man
on
the
verge
of
losing
everything."
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
Each
of
the
carved
knights
within
the
Temple
Church
lay
on
his
back
with
his
head
resting
on
a
rectangular
stone
pillow.
Sophie
felt
a
chill.
The
poem's
reference
to
an
"orb"
conjured
images
of
the
night
in
her
grandfather's
basement.
Hieros
Gamos.
The
orbs.
Sophie
wondered
if
the
ritual
had
been
performed
in
this
very
sanctuary.
The
circular
room
seemed
custom
built
for
such
a
pagan
rite.
A
stone
pew
encircled
a
bare
expanse
of
floor
in
the
middle.
A
theater
in
the
round,
as
Robert
had
called
it.
She
imagined
this
chamber
at
night,
filled
with
masked
people,
chanting
by
torchlight,
all
witnessing
a
"sacred
communion"
in
the
center
of
the
room.
Forcing
the
image
from
her
mind,
she
advanced
with
Langdon
and
Teabing
toward
the
first
group
of
knights.
Despite
Teabing's
insistence
that
their
investigation
should
be
conducted
meticulously,
Sophie
felt
eager
and
pushed
ahead
of
them,
making
a
cursory
walk
through
of
the
five
knights
on
the
left.
Scrutinizing
these
first
tombs,
Sophie
noted
the
similarities
and
differences
between
them.
Every
knight
was
on
his
back,
but
three
of
the
knights
had
their
legs
extended
straight
out
while
two
had
their
legs
crossed.
The
oddity
seemed
to
have
no
relevance
to
the
missing
orb.
Examining
their
clothing,
Sophie
noted
that
two
of
the
knights
wore
tunics
over
their
armor,
while
the
other
three
wore
ankle
length
robes.
Again,
utterly
unhelpful.
Sophie
turned
her
attention
to
the
only
other
obvious
difference
their
hand
positions.
Two
knights
clutched
swords,
two
prayed,
and
one
had
his
arms
at
his
side.
After
a
long
moment
looking
at
the
hands,
Sophie
shrugged,
having
seen
no
hint
anywhere
of
a
conspicuously
absent
orb.
Feeling
the
weight
of
the
cryptex
in
her
sweater
pocket,
she
glanced
back
at
Langdon
and
Teabing.
The
men
were
moving
slowly,
still
only
at
the
third
knight,
apparently
having
no
luck
either.
In
no
mood
to
wait,
she
turned
away
from
them
toward
the
second
group
of
knights.
As
she
crossed
the
open
space,
she
quietly
recited
the
poem
she
had
read
so
many
times
now
that
it
was
committed
to
memory.
