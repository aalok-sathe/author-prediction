men
raced
over,
guns
leveled,
and
physically
blocked
Teabing
and
his
servant
from
reaching
the
limousine.
Now
Teabing
turned.
"Inspector,
this
is
your
last
warning.
Do
not
even
think
of
boarding
that
plane.
You
will
regret
it."
Ignoring
the
threat,
the
chief
inspector
gripped
his
sidearm
and
marched
up
the
plane's
gangway.
Arriving
at
the
hatch,
he
peered
inside.
After
a
moment,
he
stepped
into
the
cabin.
What
the
devil?
With
the
exception
of
the
frightened
looking
pilot
in
the
cockpit,
the
aircraft
was
empty.
Entirely
devoid
of
human
life.
Quickly
checking
the
bathroom,
the
chairs,
and
the
luggage
areas,
the
inspector
found
no
traces
of
anyone
hiding
much
less
multiple
individuals.
What
the
hell
was
Bezu
Fache
thinking?
It
seemed
Leigh
Teabing
had
been
telling
the
truth.
The
Kent
chief
inspector
stood
alone
in
the
deserted
cabin
and
swallowed
hard.
Shit.
His
face
flushed,
he
stepped
back
onto
the
gangway,
gazing
across
the
hangar
at
Leigh
Teabing
and
his
servant,
who
were
now
under
gunpoint
near
the
limousine.
"Let
them
go,"
the
inspector
ordered.
"We
received
a
bad
tip."
Teabing's
eyes
were
menacing
even
across
the
hangar.
"You
can
expect
a
call
from
my
lawyers.
And
for
future
reference,
the
French
police
cannot
be
trusted.
With
that,
Teabing's
manservant
opened
the
door
at
the
rear
of
the
stretch
limousine
and
helped
his
crippled
master
into
the
back
seat.
Then
the
servant
walked
the
length
of
the
car,
climbed
in
behind
the
wheel,
and
gunned
the
engine.
Policemen
scattered
as
the
Jaguar
peeled
out
of
the
hangar.
"Well
played,
my
good
man,"
Teabing
chimed
from
the
rear
seat
as
the
limousine
accelerated
out
of
the
airport.
He
turned
his
eyes
now
to
the
dimly
lit
front
recesses
of
the
spacious
interior.
"Everyone
comfy?"
Langdon
gave
a
weak
nod.
He
and
Sophie
were
still
crouched
on
the
floor
beside
the
bound
and
gagged
albino.
Moments
earlier,
as
the
Hawker
taxied
into
the
deserted
hangar,
Remy
had
popped
the
hatch
as
the
plane
jolted
to
a
stop
halfway
through
its
turn.
With
the
police
closing
in
fast,
Langdon
and
Sophie
dragged
the
monk
down
the
gangway
to
ground
level
and
out
of
sight
behind
the
limousine.
Then
the
jet
engines
had
roared
again,
rotating
the
plane
and
completing
its
turn
as
the
police
cars
came
skidding
into
the
hangar.
Now,
as
the
limousine
raced
toward
Kent,
Langdon
and
Sophie
clambered
toward
the
rear
of
the
limo's
long
interior,
leaving
the
monk
bound
on
the
floor.
They
settled
onto
the
long
seat
facing
Teabing.
The
Brit
gave
them
both
a
roguish
smile
and
opened
the
cabinet
on
the
limo's
bar.
"Could
I
offer
you
a
drink?
Some
nibblies?
Crisps?
Nuts?
Seltzer?"
Sophie
and
Langdon
both
shook
their
heads.
Teabing
grinned
and
closed
the
bar.
"So
then,
about
this
knight's
tomb"
"Fleet
Street?"
Langdon
asked,
eyeing
Teabing
in
the
back
of
the
limo.
There's
a
crypt
on
Fleet
Street?
So
far,
Leigh
was
being
playfully
cagey
about
where
he
thought
they
would
find
the
"knight's
tomb,"
which,
according
to
the
poem,
would
provide
the
password
for
opening
the
smaller
cryptex.
Teabing
grinned
and
turned
to
Sophie.
"Miss
Neveu,
give
the
Harvard
boy
one
more
shot
at
the
verse,
will
you?"
Sophie
fished
in
her
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
black
cryptex,
which
was
wrapped
in
the
vellum.
Everyone
had
decided
to
leave
the
rosewood
box
and
larger
cryptex
behind
in
the
plane's
strongbox,
carrying
with
them
only
what
they
needed,
the
far
more
portable
and
discreet
black
cryptex.
Sophie
unwrapped
the
vellum
and
handed
the
sheet
to
Langdon.
Although
Langdon
had
read
the
poem
several
times
onboard
the
jet,
he
had
been
unable
to
extract
any
specific
location.
Now,
as
he
read
the
words
again,
he
processed
them
slowly
and
carefully,
hoping
the
pentametric
rhythms
would
reveal
a
clearer
meaning
now
that
he
was
on
the
ground.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
His
labor's
fruit
a
Holy
wrath
incurred.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
The
language
seemed
simple
enough.
There
was
a
knight
buried
in
London.
A
knight
who
labored
at
something
that
angered
the
Church.
A
knight
whose
tomb
was
missing
an
orb
that
should
be
present.
The
poem's
final
reference
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb
was
a
clear
allusion
to
Mary
Magdalene,
the
Rose
who
bore
the
seed
of
Jesus.
Despite
the
apparent
straightforwardness
of
the
verse,
Langdon
still
had
no
idea
who
this
knight
was
or
where
he
was
buried.
Moreover,
once
they
located
the
tomb,
it
sounded
as
if
they
would
be
searching
for
something
that
was
absent.
The
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb
?
"No
thoughts?"
Teabing
clucked
in
disappointment,
although
Langdon
sensed
the
Royal
Historian
was
enjoying
being
one
up.
"Miss
Neveu?"
She
shook
her
head.
"What
would
you
two
do
without
me?"
Teabing
said.
"Very
well,
I
will
walk
you
through
it.
It's
quite
simple
really.
The
first
line
is
the
key.
Would
you
read
it
please?"
Langdon
read
aloud.
"
'In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.'
"Precisely.
A
knight
a
Pope
interred."
He
eyed
Langdon.
"What
does
that
mean
to
you?"
Langdon
shrugged.
"A
knight
buried
by
a
Pope?
A
knight
whose
funeral
was
presided
over
by
a
Pope?"
Teabing
laughed
loudly.
"Oh,
that's
rich.
Always
the
optimist,
Robert.
Look
at
the
second
line.
This
knight
obviously
did
something
that
incurred
the
Holy
wrath
of
the
Church.
Think
again.
Consider
the
dynamic
between
the
Church
and
the
Knights
Templar.
A
knight
a
Pope
interred?"
"A
knight
a
Pope
killed?"
Sophie
asked.
Teabing
smiled
and
patted
her
knee.
"Well
done,
my
dear.
A
knight
a
Pope
buried.
Or
killed."
Langdon
thought
of
the
notorious
Templar
round
up
in
1307
unlucky
Friday
the
thirteenth
when
Pope
Clement
killed
and
interred
hundreds
of
Knights
Templar.
"But
there
must
be
endless
graves
of
'knights
killed
by
Popes.'
"Aha,
not
so!
"Teabing
said.
"Many
of
them
were
burned
at
the
stake
