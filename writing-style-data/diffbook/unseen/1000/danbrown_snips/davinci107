another.
Can
you
imagine
the
four
chests
of
Sangreal
documents
sitting
right
here
with
Mary
Magdalene's
sarcophagus?
It
gives
me
gooseflesh."
Langdon
was
feeling
gooseflesh
too
as
they
stepped
into
the
circular
chamber.
His
eye
traced
the
curvature
of
the
chamber's
pale
stone
perimeter,
taking
in
the
carvings
of
gargoyles,
demons,
monsters,
and
pained
human
faces,
all
staring
inward.
Beneath
the
carvings,
a
single
stone
pew
curled
around
the
entire
circumference
of
the
room.
"Theater
in
the
round,"
Langdon
whispered.
Teabing
raised
a
crutch,
pointing
toward
the
far
left
of
the
room
and
then
to
the
far
right.
Langdon
had
already
seen
them.
Ten
stone
knights.
Five
on
the
left.
Five
on
the
right.
Lying
prone
on
the
floor,
the
carved,
life
sized
figures
rested
in
peaceful
poses.
The
knights
were
depicted
wearing
full
armor,
shields,
and
swords,
and
the
tombs
gave
Langdon
the
uneasy
sensation
that
someone
had
snuck
in
and
poured
plaster
over
the
knights
while
they
were
sleeping.
All
of
the
figures
were
deeply
weathered,
and
yet
each
was
clearly
unique
different
armory
pieces,
distinct
leg
and
arm
positions,
facial
features,
and
markings
on
their
shields.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
Langdon
felt
shaky
as
he
inched
deeper
into
the
circular
room.
This
had
to
be
the
place.
In
a
rubbish
strewn
alley
very
close
to
Temple
Church,
Remy
Legaludec
pulled
the
Jaguar
limousine
to
a
stop
behind
a
row
of
industrial
waste
bins.
Killing
the
engine,
he
checked
the
area.
Deserted.
He
got
out
of
the
car,
walked
toward
the
rear,
and
climbed
back
into
the
limousine's
main
cabin
where
the
monk
was.
Sensing
Remy's
presence,
the
monk
in
the
back
emerged
from
a
prayer
like
trance,
his
red
eyes
looking
more
curious
than
fearful.
All
evening
Remy
had
been
impressed
with
this
trussed
man's
ability
to
stay
calm.
After
some
initial
struggles
in
the
Range
Rover,
the
monk
seemed
to
have
accepted
his
plight
and
given
over
his
fate
to
a
higher
power.
Loosening
his
bow
tie,
Remy
unbuttoned
his
high,
starched,
wing
tipped
collar
and
felt
as
if
he
could
breathe
for
the
first
time
in
years.
He
went
to
the
limousine's
wet
bar,
where
he
poured
himself
a
Smirnoff
vodka.
He
drank
it
in
a
single
swallow
and
followed
it
with
a
second.
Soon
I
will
be
a
man
of
leisure.
Searching
the
bar,
Remy
found
a
standard
service
wine
opener
and
flicked
open
the
sharp
blade.
The
knife
was
usually
employed
to
slice
the
lead
foil
from
corks
on
fine
bottles
of
wine,
but
it
would
serve
a
far
more
dramatic
purpose
this
morning.
Remy
turned
and
faced
Silas,
holding
up
the
glimmering
blade.
Now
those
red
eyes
flashed
fear.
Remy
smiled
and
moved
toward
the
back
of
the
limousine.
The
monk
recoiled,
struggling
against
his
bonds.
"Be
still,"
Remy
whispered,
raising
the
blade.
Silas
could
not
believe
that
God
had
forsaken
him.
Even
the
physical
pain
of
being
bound
Silas
had
turned
into
a
spiritual
exercise,
asking
the
throb
of
his
blood
starved
muscles
to
remind
him
of
the
pain
Christ
endured.
have
been
praying
all
night
for
liberation.
Now,
as
the
knife
descended,
Silas
clenched
his
eyes
shut.
A
slash
of
pain
tore
through
his
shoulder
blades.
He
cried
out,
unable
to
believe
he
was
going
to
die
here
in
the
back
of
this
limousine,
unable
to
defend
himself.
was
doing
God's
work.
The
Teacher
said
he
would
protect
me.
Silas
felt
the
biting
warmth
spreading
across
his
back
and
shoulders
and
could
picture
his
own
blood,
spilling
out
over
his
flesh.
A
piercing
pain
cut
through
his
thighs
now,
and
he
felt
the
onset
of
that
familiar
undertow
of
disorientation
the
body's
defense
mechanism
against
the
pain.
As
the
biting
heat
tore
through
all
of
his
muscles
now,
Silas
clenched
his
eyes
tighter,
determined
that
the
final
image
of
his
life
would
not
be
of
his
own
killer.
Instead
he
pictured
a
younger
Bishop
Aringarosa,
standing
before
the
small
church
in
Spain
the
church
that
he
and
Silas
had
built
with
their
own
hands.
The
beginning
of
my
life.
Silas
felt
as
if
his
body
were
on
fire.
"Take
a
drink,"
the
tuxedoed
man
whispered,
his
accent
French.
"It
will
help
with
your
circulation."
Silas's
eyes
flew
open
in
surprise.
A
blurry
image
was
leaning
over
him,
offering
a
glass
of
liquid.
A
mound
of
shredded
duct
tape
lay
on
the
floor
beside
the
bloodless
knife.
"Drink
this,"
he
repeated.
"The
pain
you
feel
is
the
blood
rushing
into
your
muscles."
Silas
felt
the
fiery
throb
transforming
now
to
a
prickling
sting.
The
vodka
tasted
terrible,
but
he
drank
it,
feeling
grateful.
Fate
had
dealt
Silas
a
healthy
share
of
bad
luck
tonight,
but
God
had
solved
it
all
with
one
miraculous
twist.
God
has
not
forsaken
me.
Silas
knew
what
Bishop
Aringarosa
would
call
it.
Divine
intervention.
"I
had
wanted
to
free
you
earlier,"
the
servant
apologized,
"but
it
was
impossible.
With
the
police
arriving
at
Chateau
Villette,
and
then
at
Biggin
Hill
airport,
this
was
the
first
possible
moment.
You
understand,
don't
you,
Silas?"
Silas
recoiled,
startled.
"You
know
my
name?"
The
servant
smiled.
Silas
sat
up
now,
rubbing
his
stiff
muscles,
his
emotions
a
torrent
of
incredulity,
appreciation,
and
confusion.
"Are
you
the
Teacher?"
Remy
shook
his
head,
laughing
at
the
proposition.
"I
wish
I
had
that
kind
of
power.
No,
I
am
not
the
Teacher.
Like
you,
I
serve
him.
But
the
Teacher
speaks
highly
of
you.
My
name
is
Remy."
Silas
was
amazed.
"I
don't
understand.
If
you
work
for
the
Teacher,
why
did
Langdon
bring
the
keystone
to
your
home?"
"Not
my
home.
The
home
of
the
world's
foremost
Grail
historian,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing."
"But
you
live
there.
The
odds"
Remy
smiled,
seeming
to
have
no
trouble
with
the
apparent
coincidence
of
Langdon's
chosen
refuge.
"It
was
all
utterly
predictable.
Robert
Langdon
was
in
possession
of
the
keystone,
and
he
needed
help.
What
more
logical
place
to
run
than
to
