Abu
Yusuf
Ismail
al
Kindi
protected
his
secrets
with
an
ingeniously
conceived
polyalphabetic
substitution
cipher.
Da
Vinci,
however,
eschewed
mathematics
and
cryptology
for
a
mechanical
solution.
The
cryptex.
A
portable
container
that
could
safeguard
letters,
maps,
diagrams,
anything
at
all.
Once
information
was
sealed
inside
the
cryptex,
only
the
individual
with
the
proper
password
could
access
it.
"We
require
a
password,"
Sophie
said,
pointing
out
the
lettered
dials.
"A
cryptex
works
much
like
a
bicycle's
combination
lock.
If
you
align
the
dials
in
the
proper
position,
the
lock
slides
open.
This
cryptex
has
five
lettered
dials.
When
you
rotate
them
to
their
proper
sequence,
the
tumblers
inside
align,
and
the
entire
cylinder
slides
apart."
"And
inside?"
"Once
the
cylinder
slides
apart,
you
have
access
to
a
hollow
central
compartment,
which
can
hold
a
scroll
of
paper
on
which
is
the
information
you
want
to
keep
private."
Langdon
looked
incredulous.
"And
you
say
your
grandfather
built
these
for
you
when
you
were
younger?"
"Some
smaller
ones,
yes.
A
couple
times
for
my
birthday,
he
gave
me
a
cryptex
and
told
me
a
riddle.
The
answer
to
the
riddle
was
the
password
to
the
cryptex,
and
once
I
figured
it
out,
I
could
open
it
up
and
find
my
birthday
card."
"A
lot
of
work
for
a
card."
"No,
the
cards
always
contained
another
riddle
or
clue.
My
grandfather
loved
creating
elaborate
treasure
hunts
around
our
house,
a
string
of
clues
that
eventually
led
to
my
real
gift.
Each
treasure
hunt
was
a
test
of
character
and
merit,
to
ensure
I
earned
my
rewards.
And
the
tests
were
never
simple."
Langdon
eyed
the
device
again,
still
looking
skeptical.
"But
why
not
just
pry
it
apart?
Or
smash
it?
The
metal
looks
delicate,
and
marble
is
a
soft
rock.
Sophie
smiled.
"Because
Da
Vinci
is
too
smart
for
that.
He
designed
the
cryptex
so
that
if
you
try
to
force
it
open
in
any
way,
the
information
self
destructs.
Watch."
Sophie
reached
into
the
box
and
carefully
lifted
out
the
cylinder.
"Any
information
to
be
inserted
is
first
written
on
a
papyrus
scroll."
"Not
vellum?"
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"Papyrus.
I
know
sheep's
vellum
was
more
durable
and
more
common
in
those
days,
but
it
had
to
be
papyrus.
The
thinner
the
better."
"Okay."
"Before
the
papyrus
was
inserted
into
the
cryptex's
compartment,
it
was
rolled
around
a
delicate
glass
vial."
She
tipped
the
cryptex,
and
the
liquid
inside
gurgled.
"A
vial
of
liquid."
"Liquid
what?"
Sophie
smiled.
"Vinegar."
Langdon
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
began
nodding.
"Brilliant."
Vinegar
and
papyrus,
Sophie
thought.
If
someone
attempted
to
force
open
the
cryptex,
the
glass
vial
would
break,
and
the
vinegar
would
quickly
dissolve
the
papyrus.
By
the
time
anyone
extracted
the
secret
message,
it
would
be
a
glob
of
meaningless
pulp.
"As
you
can
see,"
Sophie
told
him,
"the
only
way
to
access
the
information
inside
is
to
know
the
proper
five
letter
password.
And
with
five
dials,
each
with
twenty
six
letters,
that's
twenty
six
to
the
fifth
power."
She
quickly
estimated
the
permutations.
"Approximately
twelve
million
possibilities."
"If
you
say
so,"
Langdon
said,
looking
like
he
had
approximately
twelve
million
questions
running
through
his
head.
"What
information
do
you
think
is
inside?"
"Whatever
it
is,
my
grandfather
obviously
wanted
very
badly
to
keep
it
secret."
She
paused,
closing
the
box
lid
and
eyeing
the
five
petal
Rose
inlaid
on
it.
Something
was
bothering
her.
"Did
you
say
earlier
that
the
Rose
is
a
symbol
for
the
Grail?"
"Exactly.
In
Priory
symbolism,
the
Rose
and
the
Grail
are
synonymous."
Sophie
furrowed
her
brow.
"That's
strange,
because
my
grandfather
always
told
me
the
Rose
meant
secrecy.
He
used
to
hang
a
rose
on
his
office
door
at
home
when
he
was
having
a
confidential
phone
call
and
didn't
want
me
to
disturb
him.
He
encouraged
me
to
do
the
same."
Sweetie,
her
grandfather
said,
rather
than
lock
each
other
out,
we
can
each
hang
a
rose
lafleur
des
secrets
on
our
door
when
we
need
privacy.
This
way
we
learn
to
respect
and
trust
each
other.
Hanging
a
rose
is
an
ancient
Roman
custom.
"Sub
rosa,
"
Langdon
said.
"The
Romans
hung
a
rose
over
meetings
to
indicate
the
meeting
was
confidential.
Attendees
understood
that
whatever
was
said
under
the
rose
or
sub
rosa
had
to
remain
a
secret."
Langdon
quickly
explained
that
the
Rose's
overtone
of
secrecy
was
not
the
only
reason
the
Priory
used
it
as
a
symbol
for
the
Grail.
Rosa
rugosa,
one
of
the
oldest
species
of
rose,
had
five
petals
and
pentagonal
symmetry,
just
like
the
guiding
star
of
Venus,
giving
the
Rose
strong
iconographic
ties
to
womanhood.
In
addition,
the
Rose
had
close
ties
to
the
concept
of
"true
direction"
and
navigating
one's
way.
The
Compass
Rose
helped
travelers
navigate,
as
did
Rose
Lines,
the
longitudinal
lines
on
maps.
For
this
reason,
the
Rose
was
a
symbol
that
spoke
of
the
Grail
on
many
levels
secrecy,
womanhood,
and
guidance
the
feminine
chalice
and
guiding
star
that
led
to
secret
truth.
As
Langdon
finished
his
explanation,
his
expression
seemed
to
tighten
suddenly.
"Robert?
Are
you
okay?"
His
eyes
were
riveted
to
the
rosewood
box.
"Sub
rosa,
"
he
choked,
a
fearful
bewilderment
sweeping
across
his
face.
"It
can't
be."
"What?"
Langdon
slowly
raised
his
eyes.
"Under
the
sign
of
the
Rose,"
he
whispered.
"This
cryptex
I
think
I
know
what
it
is."
Langdon
could
scarcely
believe
his
own
supposition,
and
yet,
considering
who
had
given
this
stone
cylinder
to
them,
how
he
had
given
it
to
them,
and
now,
the
inlaid
Rose
on
the
container,
Langdon
could
formulate
only
one
conclusion.
am
holding
the
Priory
keystone.
The
legend
was
specific.
The
keystone
is
an
encoded
stone
that
lies
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
"Robert?"
Sophie
was
watching
him.
"What's
going
on?"
Langdon
needed
a
moment
to
gather
his
thoughts.
"Did
your
grandfather
ever
speak
to
you
of
something
called
la
clef
de
voiite?"
"The
key
to
the
vault?"
