tore
into
the
wall
above
him.
The
reverberation
shook
the
back
of
the
truck
as
a
spent
shell
clinked
onto
the
cargo
floor.
Shit!
Langdon
froze.
Vernet
spoke
more
confidently
now.
"Mr.
Langdon,
pick
up
the
box."
Langdon
lifted
the
box.
"Now
bring
it
over
to
me."
Vernet
was
taking
dead
aim,
standing
on
the
ground
behind
the
rear
bumper,
his
gun
outstretched
into
the
cargo
hold
now.
Box
in
hand,
Langdon
moved
across
the
hold
toward
the
open
door.
I've
got
to
do
something!
Langdon
thought.
I'm
about
to
hand
over
the
Priory
keystone!
As
Langdon
moved
toward
the
doorway,
his
position
of
higher
ground
became
more
pronounced,
and
he
began
wondering
if
he
could
somehow
use
it
to
his
advantage.
Vernet's
gun,
though
raised,
was
at
Langdon's
knee
level.
A
well
placed
kick
perhaps?
Unfortunately,
as
Langdon
neared,
Vernet
seemed
to
sense
the
dangerous
dynamic
developing,
and
he
took
several
steps
back,
repositioning
himself
six
feet
away.
Well
out
of
reach.
Vernet
commanded,
"Place
the
box
beside
the
door."
Seeing
no
options,
Langdon
knelt
down
and
set
the
rosewood
box
at
the
edge
of
the
cargo
hold,
directly
in
front
of
the
open
doors.
"Now
stand
up."
Langdon
began
to
stand
up
but
paused,
spying
the
small,
spent
pistol
shell
on
the
floor
beside
the
truck's
precision
crafted
doorsill.
"Stand
up,
and
step
away
from
the
box."
Langdon
paused
a
moment
longer,
eyeing
the
metal
threshold.
Then
he
stood.
As
he
did,
he
discreetly
brushed
the
shell
over
the
edge
onto
the
narrow
ledge
that
was
the
door's
lower
sill.
Fully
upright
now,
Langdon
stepped
backward.
"Return
to
the
back
wall
and
turn
around."
Langdon
obeyed.
Vernet
could
feel
his
own
heart
pounding.
Aiming
the
gun
with
his
right
hand,
he
reached
now
with
his
left
for
the
wooden
box.
He
discovered
that
it
was
far
too
heavy.
need
two
hands.
Turning
his
eyes
back
to
his
captives,
he
calculated
the
risk.
Both
were
a
good
fifteen
feet
away,
at
the
far
end
of
the
cargo
hold,
facing
away
from
him.
Vernet
made
up
his
mind.
Quickly,
he
laid
down
the
gun
on
the
bumper,
lifted
the
box
with
two
hands,
and
set
it
on
the
ground,
immediately
grabbing
the
gun
again
and
aiming
it
back
into
the
hold.
Neither
of
his
prisoners
had
moved.
Perfect.
Now
all
that
remained
was
to
close
and
lock
the
door.
Leaving
the
box
on
the
ground
for
the
moment,
he
grabbed
the
metal
door
and
began
to
heave
it
closed.
As
the
door
swung
past
him,
Vernet
reached
up
to
grab
the
single
bolt
that
needed
to
be
slid
into
place.
The
door
closed
with
a
thud,
and
Vernet
quickly
grabbed
the
bolt,
pulling
it
to
the
left.
The
bolt
slid
a
few
inches
and
crunched
to
an
unexpected
halt,
not
lining
up
with
its
sleeve.
What's
going
on?
Vernet
pulled
again,
but
the
bolt
wouldn't
lock.
The
mechanism
was
not
properly
aligned.
The
door
isn't
fully
closed!
Feeling
a
surge
of
panic,
Vernet
shoved
hard
against
the
outside
of
the
door,
but
it
refused
to
budge.
Something
is
blocking
it!
Vernet
turned
to
throw
full
shoulder
into
the
door,
but
this
time
the
door
exploded
outward,
striking
Vernet
in
the
face
and
sending
him
reeling
backward
onto
the
ground,
his
nose
shattering
in
pain.
The
gun
flew
as
Vernet
reached
for
his
face
and
felt
the
warm
blood
running
from
his
nose.
Robert
Langdon
hit
the
ground
somewhere
nearby,
and
Vernet
tried
to
get
up,
but
he
couldn't
see.
His
vision
blurred
and
he
fell
backward
again.
Sophie
Neveu
was
shouting.
Moments
later,
Vernet
felt
a
cloud
of
dirt
and
exhaust
billowing
over
him.
He
heard
the
crunching
of
tires
on
gravel
and
sat
up
just
in
time
to
see
the
truck's
wide
wheelbase
fail
to
navigate
a
turn.
There
was
a
crash
as
the
front
bumper
clipped
a
tree.
The
engine
roared,
and
the
tree
bent.
Finally,
it
was
the
bumper
that
gave,
tearing
half
off.
The
armored
car
lurched
away,
its
front
bumper
dragging.
When
the
truck
reached
the
paved
access
road,
a
shower
of
sparks
lit
up
the
night,
trailing
the
truck
as
it
sped
away.
Vernet
turned
his
eyes
back
to
the
ground
where
the
truck
had
been
parked.
Even
in
the
faint
moonlight
he
could
see
there
was
nothing
there.
The
wooden
box
was
gone.
The
unmarked
Fiat
sedan
departing
Castel
Gandolfo
snaked
downward
through
the
Alban
Hills
into
the
valley
below.
In
the
back
seat,
Bishop
Aringarosa
smiled,
feeling
the
weight
of
the
bearer
bonds
in
the
briefcase
on
his
lap
and
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
he
and
the
Teacher
could
make
the
exchange.
Twenty
million
euro.
The
sum
would
buy
Aringarosa
power
far
more
valuable
than
that.
As
his
car
sped
back
toward
Rome,
Aringarosa
again
found
himself
wondering
why
the
Teacher
had
not
yet
contacted
him.
Pulling
his
cell
phone
from
his
cassock
pocket,
he
checked
the
carrier
signal.
Extremely
faint.
"Cell
service
is
intermittent
up
here,"
the
driver
said,
glancing
at
him
in
the
rearview
mirror.
"In
about
five
minutes,
we'll
be
out
of
the
mountains,
and
service
improves."
"Thank
you."
Aringarosa
felt
a
sudden
surge
of
concern.
No
service
in
the
mountains?
Maybe
the
Teacher
had
been
trying
to
reach
him
all
this
time.
Maybe
something
had
gone
terribly
wrong.
Quickly,
Aringarosa
checked
the
phone's
voice
mail.
Nothing.
Then
again,
he
realized,
the
Teacher
never
would
have
left
a
recorded
message;
he
was
a
man
who
took
enormous
care
with
his
communications.
Nobody
understood
better
than
the
Teacher
the
perils
of
speaking
openly
in
this
modern
world.
Electronic
eavesdropping
had
played
a
major
role
in
how
he
had
gathered
his
astonishing
array
of
secret
knowledge.
For
this
reason,
he
takes
extra
precautions.
Unfortunately,
the
Teacher's
protocols
for
caution
included
a
refusal
to
give
Aringarosa
any
kind
of
contact
number.
alone
will
initiate
contact,
the
Teacher
had
informed
him.
So
keep
your
phone
close.
Now
that
Aringarosa
realized
