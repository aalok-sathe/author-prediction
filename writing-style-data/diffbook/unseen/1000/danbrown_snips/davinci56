paused
at
the
door,
looking
pale.
"But
of
course.
Like
most
Swiss
banks,
our
safe
deposit
boxes
are
attached
to
a
number,
not
a
name.
You
have
a
key
and
a
personal
account
number
known
only
to
you.
Your
key
is
only
half
of
your
identification.
Your
personal
account
number
is
the
other
half.
Otherwise,
if
you
lost
your
key,
anyone
could
use
it."
Sophie
hesitated.
"And
if
my
benefactor
gave
me
no
account
number?"
The
banker's
heart
pounded.
Then
you
obviously
have
no
business
here!
He
gave
them
a
calm
smile.
"I
will
ask
someone
to
help
you.
He
will
be
in
shortly."
Leaving,
the
banker
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
twisted
a
heavy
lock,
sealing
them
inside.
Across
town,
Collet
was
standing
in
the
Gare
du
Nord
train
terminal
when
his
phone
rang.
It
was
Fache.
"Interpol
got
a
tip,"
he
said.
"Forget
the
train.
Langdon
and
Neveu
just
walked
into
the
Paris
branch
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich.
I
want
your
men
over
there
right
away."
"Any
leads
yet
on
what
Sauniere
was
trying
to
tell
Agent
Neveu
and
Robert
Langdon?"
Fache's
tone
was
cold.
"If
you
arrest
them,
Lieutenant
Collet,
then
I
can
ask
them
personally."
Collet
took
the
hint.
"Twenty
four
Rue
Haxo.
Right
away,
Captain."
He
hung
up
and
radioed
his
men.
Andre
Vernet
president
of
the
Paris
branch
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
lived
in
a
lavish
flat
above
the
bank.
Despite
his
plush
accommodations,
he
had
always
dreamed
of
owning
a
riverside
apartment
on
L'lle
Saint
Louis,
where
he
could
rub
shoulders
with
the
true
cognoscenti,
rather
than
here,
where
he
simply
met
the
filthy
rich.
When
I
retire,
Vernet
told
himself,
will
fill
my
cellar
with
rare
Bordeaux,
adorn
my
salon
with
a
Fragonard
and
perhaps
a
Boucher,
and
spend
my
days
hunting
for
antique
furniture
and
rare
books
in
the
Quartier
Latin.
Tonight,
Vernet
had
been
awake
only
six
and
a
half
minutes.
Even
so,
as
he
hurried
through
the
bank's
underground
corridor,
he
looked
as
if
his
personal
tailor
and
hairdresser
had
polished
him
to
a
fine
sheen.
Impeccably
dressed
in
a
silk
suit,
Vernet
sprayed
some
breath
spray
in
his
mouth
and
tightened
his
tie
as
he
walked.
No
stranger
to
being
awoken
to
attend
to
his
international
clients
arriving
from
different
time
zones,
Vernet
modeled
his
sleep
habits
after
the
Maasai
warriors
the
African
tribe
famous
for
their
ability
to
rise
from
the
deepest
sleep
to
a
state
of
total
battle
readiness
in
a
matter
of
seconds.
Battle
ready,
Vernet
thought,
fearing
the
comparison
might
be
uncharacteristically
apt
tonight.
The
arrival
of
a
gold
key
client
always
required
an
extra
flurry
of
attention,
but
the
arrival
of
a
gold
key
client
who
was
wanted
by
the
Judicial
Police
would
be
an
extremely
delicate
matter.
The
bank
had
enough
battles
with
law
enforcement
over
the
privacy
rights
of
their
clients
without
proof
that
some
of
them
were
criminals.
Five
minutes,
Vernet
told
himself.
need
these
people
out
of
my
bank
before
the
police
arrive.
If
he
moved
quickly,
this
impending
disaster
could
be
deftly
sidestepped.
Vernet
could
tell
the
police
that
the
fugitives
in
question
had
indeed
walked
into
his
bank
as
reported,
but
because
they
were
not
clients
and
had
no
account
number,
they
were
turned
away.
He
wished
the
damned
watchman
had
not
called
Interpol.
Discretion
was
apparently
not
part
of
the
vocabulary
of
a
15
euro
per
hour
watchman.
Stopping
at
the
doorway,
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
loosened
his
muscles.
Then,
forcing
a
balmy
smile,
he
unlocked
the
door
and
swirled
into
the
room
like
a
warm
breeze.
"Good
evening,"
he
said,
his
eyes
finding
his
clients.
"I
am
Andre
Vernet.
How
can
I
be
of
serv
The
rest
of
the
sentence
lodged
somewhere
beneath
his
Adam's
apple.
The
woman
before
him
was
as
unexpected
a
visitor
as
Vernet
had
ever
had.
"I'm
sorry,
do
we
know
each
other?"
Sophie
asked.
She
did
not
recognize
the
banker,
but
he
for
a
moment
looked
as
if
he'd
seen
a
ghost.
"No,"
the
bank
president
fumbled.
"I
don't
believe
so.
Our
services
are
anonymous."
He
exhaled
and
forced
a
calm
smile.
"My
assistant
tells
me
you
have
a
gold
key
but
no
account
number?
Might
I
ask
how
you
came
by
this
key?"
"My
grandfather
gave
it
to
me,"
Sophie
replied,
watching
the
man
closely.
His
uneasiness
seemed
more
evident
now.
"Really?
Your
grandfather
gave
you
the
key
but
failed
to
give
you
the
account
number?"
"I
don't
think
he
had
time,"
Sophie
said.
"He
was
murdered
tonight."
Her
words
sent
the
man
staggering
backward.
"Jacques
Sauniere
is
dead?"
he
demanded,
his
eyes
filling
with
horror.
"But
how?!"
Now
it
was
Sophie
who
reeled,
numb
with
shock.
"You
knew
my
grandfather?"
Banker
Andre
Vernet
looked
equally
astounded,
steadying
himself
by
leaning
on
an
end
table.
"Jacques
and
I
were
dear
friends.
When
did
this
happen?"
"Earlier
this
evening.
Inside
the
Louvre."
Vernet
walked
to
a
deep
leather
chair
and
sank
into
it.
"I
need
to
ask
you
both
a
very
important
question."
He
glanced
up
at
Langdon
and
then
back
to
Sophie.
"Did
either
of
you
have
anything
to
do
with
his
death?"
"No!"
Sophie
declared.
"Absolutely
not."
Vernet's
face
was
grim,
and
he
paused,
pondering.
"Your
pictures
are
being
circulated
by
Interpol.
This
is
how
I
recognized
you.
You're
wanted
for
a
murder."
Sophie
slumped.
Fache
ran
an
Interpol
broadcast
already?
It
seemed
the
captain
was
more
motivated
than
Sophie
had
anticipated.
She
quickly
told
Vernet
who
Langdon
was
and
what
had
happened
inside
the
Louvre
tonight.
Vernet
looked
amazed.
"And
as
your
grandfather
was
dying,
he
left
you
a
message
telling
you
to
find
Mr.
Langdon?"
"Yes.
And
this
key."
Sophie
laid
the
gold
key
on
the
coffee
table
in
front
of
Vernet,
placing
the
Priory
seal
face
down.
Vernet
glanced
at
the
key
but
made
no
move
to
touch
it.
"He
left
you
only
this
key?
Nothing
else?
No
