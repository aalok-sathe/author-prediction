familiar
sounds
and
should
have
comforted
him.
And
yet
he
felt
a
sudden
and
unexpected
wariness.
Standing,
wearing
only
his
undergarments,
Silas
walked
to
the
window.
Was
I
followed?
The
courtyard
below
was
deserted,
exactly
as
he
had
seen
it
when
he
entered.
He
listened.
Silence.
So
why
am
I
uneasy?
Long
ago
Silas
had
learned
to
trust
his
intuition.
Intuition
had
kept
him
alive
as
a
child
on
the
streets
of
Marseilles
long
before
prison
long
before
he
was
born
again
by
the
hand
of
Bishop
Aringarosa.
Peering
out
the
window,
he
now
saw
the
faint
outline
of
a
car
through
the
hedge.
On
the
car's
roof
was
a
police
siren.
A
floorboard
creaked
in
the
hallway.
A
door
latch
moved.
Silas
reacted
on
instinct,
surging
across
the
room
and
sliding
to
a
stop
just
behind
the
door
as
it
crashed
open.
The
first
police
officer
stormed
through,
swinging
his
gun
left
then
right
at
what
appeared
an
empty
room.
Before
he
realized
where
Silas
was,
Silas
had
thrown
his
shoulder
into
the
door,
crushing
a
second
officer
as
he
came
through.
As
the
first
officer
wheeled
to
shoot,
Silas
dove
for
his
legs.
The
gun
went
off,
the
bullet
sailing
above
Silas's
head,
just
as
he
connected
with
the
officer's
shins,
driving
his
legs
out
from
under
him,
and
sending
the
man
down,
his
head
hitting
the
floor.
The
second
officer
staggered
to
his
feet
in
the
doorway,
and
Silas
drove
a
knee
into
his
groin,
then
went
clambering
over
the
writhing
body
into
the
hall.
Almost
naked,
Silas
hurled
his
pale
body
down
the
staircase.
He
knew
he
had
been
betrayed,
but
by
whom?
When
he
reached
the
foyer,
more
officers
were
surging
through
the
front
door.
Silas
turned
the
other
way
and
dashed
deeper
into
the
residence
hall.
The
women
's
entrance.
Every
Opus
Dei
building
has
one.
Winding
down
narrow
hallways,
Silas
snaked
through
a
kitchen,
past
terrified
workers,
who
left
to
avoid
the
naked
albino
as
he
knocked
over
bowls
and
silverware,
bursting
into
a
dark
hallway
near
the
boiler
room.
He
now
saw
the
door
he
sought,
an
exit
light
gleaming
at
the
end.
Running
full
speed
through
the
door
out
into
the
rain,
Silas
leapt
off
the
low
landing,
not
seeing
the
officer
coming
the
other
way
until
it
was
too
late.
The
two
men
collided,
Silas's
broad,
naked
shoulder
grinding
into
the
man's
sternum
with
crushing
force.
He
drove
the
officer
backward
onto
the
pavement,
landing
hard
on
top
of
him.
The
officer's
gun
clattered
away.
Silas
could
hear
men
running
down
the
hall
shouting.
Rolling,
he
grabbed
the
loose
gun
just
as
the
officers
emerged.
A
shot
rang
out
on
the
stairs,
and
Silas
felt
a
searing
pain
below
his
ribs.
Filled
with
rage,
he
opened
fire
at
all
three
officers,
their
blood
spraying.
A
dark
shadow
loomed
behind,
coming
out
of
nowhere.
The
angry
hands
that
grabbed
at
his
bare
shoulders
felt
as
if
they
were
infused
with
the
power
of
the
devil
himself.
The
man
roared
in
his
ear.
SILAS,
NO!
Silas
spun
and
fired.
Their
eyes
met.
Silas
was
already
screaming
in
horror
as
Bishop
Aringarosa
fell.
More
than
three
thousand
people
are
entombed
or
enshrined
within
Westminster
Abbey.
The
colossal
stone
interior
burgeons
with
the
remains
of
kings,
statesmen,
scientists,
poets,
and
musicians.
Their
tombs,
packed
into
every
last
niche
and
alcove,
range
in
grandeur
from
the
most
regal
of
mausoleums
that
of
Queen
Elizabeth
I,
whose
canopied
sarcophagus
inhabits
its
own
private,
apsidal
chapel
down
to
the
most
modest
etched
floor
tiles
whose
inscriptions
have
worn
away
with
centuries
of
foot
traffic,
leaving
it
to
one's
imagination
whose
relics
might
lie
below
the
tile
in
the
undercroft.
Designed
in
the
style
of
the
great
cathedrals
of
Amiens,
Chartres,
and
Canterbury,
Westminster
Abbey
is
considered
neither
cathedral
nor
parish
church.
It
bears
the
classification
of
royal
peculiar,
subject
only
to
the
Sovereign.
Since
hosting
the
coronation
of
William
the
Conqueror
on
Christmas
Day
in
1066,
the
dazzling
sanctuary
has
witnessed
an
endless
procession
of
royal
ceremonies
and
affairs
of
state
from
the
canonization
of
Edward
the
Confessor,
to
the
marriage
of
Prince
Andrew
and
Sarah
Ferguson,
to
the
funerals
of
Henry
V,
Queen
Elizabeth
I,
and
Lady
Diana.
Even
so,
Robert
Langdon
currently
felt
no
interest
in
any
of
the
abbey's
ancient
history,
save
one
event
the
funeral
of
the
British
knight
Sir
Isaac
Newton.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
Hurrying
through
the
grand
portico
on
the
north
transept,
Langdon
and
Sophie
were
met
by
guards
who
politely
ushered
them
through
the
abbey's
newest
addition
a
large
walk
through
metal
detector
now
present
in
most
historic
buildings
in
London.
They
both
passed
through
without
setting
off
the
alarm
and
continued
to
the
abbey
entrance.
Stepping
across
the
threshold
into
Westminster
Abbey,
Langdon
felt
the
outside
world
evaporate
with
a
sudden
hush.
No
rumble
of
traffic.
No
hiss
of
rain.
Just
a
deafening
silence,
which
seemed
to
reverberate
back
and
forth
as
if
the
building
were
whispering
to
itself.
Langdon's
and
Sophie's
eyes,
like
those
of
almost
every
visitor,
shifted
immediately
skyward,
where
the
abbey's
great
abyss
seemed
to
explode
overhead.
Gray
stone
columns
ascended
like
redwoods
into
the
shadows,
arching
gracefully
over
dizzying
expanses,
and
then
shooting
back
down
to
the
stone
floor.
Before
them,
the
wide
alley
of
the
north
transept
stretched
out
like
a
deep
canyon,
flanked
by
sheer
cliffs
of
stained
glass.
On
sunny
days,
the
abbey
floor
was
a
prismatic
patchwork
of
light.
Today,
the
rain
and
darkness
gave
this
massive
hollow
a
wraithlike
aura
more
like
that
of
the
crypt
it
truly
was.
"It's
practically
empty,"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
felt
disappointed.
He
had
hoped
for
a
lot
more
people.
A
more
public
place.
Their
earlier
experience
in
the
deserted
Temple
Church
was
not
one
Langdon
wanted
to
repeat.
He
had
been
anticipating
a
certain
feeling
of
security
in
the
popular
tourist
destination,
but
Langdon's
recollections
of
bustling
throngs
