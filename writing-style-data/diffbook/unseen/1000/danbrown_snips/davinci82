me,
I
have
been
researching
them
for
decades,
and
I
can't
even
name
one
Priory
member.
It
seems
inconceivable
that
all
three
senechaux
and
the
Grand
Master
could
be
discovered
and
killed
in
one
day.
"I
doubt
the
information
was
gathered
in
a
single
day,"
Sophie
said.
"It
sounds
like
a
well
planned
decapiter.
It's
a
technique
we
use
to
fight
organized
crime
syndicates.
If
DCPJ
wants
to
move
on
a
certain
group,
they
will
silently
listen
and
watch
for
months,
identify
all
the
main
players,
and
then
move
in
and
take
them
all
at
the
same
moment.
Decapitation.
With
no
leadership,
the
group
falls
into
chaos
and
divulges
other
information.
It's
possible
someone
patiently
watched
the
Priory
and
then
attacked,
hoping
the
top
people
would
reveal
the
location
of
the
keystone."
Teabing
looked
unconvinced.
"But
the
brothers
would
never
talk.
They
are
sworn
to
secrecy.
Even
in
the
face
of
death."
"Exactly,"
Langdon
said.
"Meaning,
if
they
never
divulged
the
secret,
and
they
were
killed"
Teabing
gasped.
"Then
the
location
of
the
keystone
would
be
lost
forever!"
"And
with
it,"
Langdon
said,
"the
location
of
the
Holy
Grail."
Teabing's
body
seemed
to
sway
with
the
weight
of
Langdon's
words.
Then,
as
if
too
tired
to
stand
another
moment,
he
flopped
in
a
chair
and
stared
out
the
window.
Sophie
walked
over,
her
voice
soft.
"Considering
my
grandfather's
predicament,
it
seems
possible
that
in
total
desperation
he
tried
to
pass
the
secret
on
to
someone
outside
the
brotherhood.
Someone
he
thought
he
could
trust.
Someone
in
his
family."
Teabing
was
pale.
"But
someone
capable
of
such
an
attack
of
discovering
so
much
about
the
brotherhood"
He
paused,
radiating
a
new
fear.
"It
could
only
be
one
force.
This
kind
of
infiltration
could
only
have
come
from
the
Priory's
oldest
enemy."
Langdon
glanced
up.
"The
Church."
"Who
else?
Rome
has
been
seeking
the
Grail
for
centuries."
Sophie
was
skeptical.
"You
think
the
Church
killed
my
grandfather?"
Teabing
replied,
"It
would
not
be
the
first
time
in
history
the
Church
has
killed
to
protect
itself.
The
documents
that
accompany
the
Holy
Grail
are
explosive,
and
the
Church
has
wanted
to
destroy
them
for
years."
Langdon
was
having
trouble
buying
Teabing's
premise
that
the
Church
would
blatantly
murder
people
to
obtain
these
documents.
Having
met
the
new
Pope
and
many
of
the
cardinals,
Langdon
knew
they
were
deeply
spiritual
men
who
would
never
condone
assassination.
Regardless
of
the
stakes.
Sophie
seemed
to
be
having
similar
thoughts.
"Isn't
it
possible
that
these
Priory
members
were
murdered
by
someone
outside
the
Church?
Someone
who
didn't
understand
what
the
Grail
really
is?
The
Cup
of
Christ,
after
all,
would
be
quite
an
enticing
treasure.
Certainly
treasure
hunters
have
killed
for
less."
"In
my
experience,"
Teabing
said,
"men
go
to
far
greater
lengths
to
avoid
what
they
fear
than
to
obtain
what
they
desire.
I
sense
a
desperation
in
this
assault
on
the
Priory."
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
"the
argument
is
paradoxical.
Why
would
members
of
the
Catholic
clergy
murder
Priory
members
in
an
effort
to
find
and
destroy
documents
they
believe
are
false
testimony
anyway?"
Teabing
chuckled.
"The
ivory
towers
of
Harvard
have
made
you
soft,
Robert.
Yes,
the
clergy
in
Rome
are
blessed
with
potent
faith,
and
because
of
this,
their
beliefs
can
weather
any
storm,
including
documents
that
contradict
everything
they
hold
dear.
But
what
about
the
rest
of
the
world?
What
about
those
who
are
not
blessed
with
absolute
certainty?
What
about
those
who
look
at
the
cruelty
in
the
world
and
say,
where
is
God
today?
Those
who
look
at
Church
scandals
and
ask,
who
are
these
men
who
claim
to
speak
the
truth
about
Christ
and
yet
lie
to
cover
up
the
sexual
abuse
of
children
by
their
own
priests?"
Teabing
paused.
"What
happens
to
those
people,
Robert,
if
persuasive
scientific
evidence
comes
out
that
the
Church's
version
of
the
Christ
story
is
inaccurate,
and
that
the
greatest
story
ever
told
is,
in
fact,
the
greatest
story
ever
sold"
Langdon
did
not
respond.
"I'll
tell
you
what
happens
if
the
documents
get
out,"
Teabing
said.
"The
Vatican
faces
a
crisis
of
faith
unprecedented
in
its
two
millennia
history."
After
a
long
silence,
Sophie
said,
"But
if
it
is
the
Church
who
is
responsible
for
this
attack,
why
would
they
act
now?
After
all
these
years?
The
Priory
keeps
the
Sangreal
documents
hidden.
They
pose
no
immediate
threat
to
the
Church."
Teabing
heaved
an
ominous
sigh
and
glanced
at
Langdon.
"Robert,
I
assume
you
are
familiar
with
the
Priory's
final
charge?"
Langdon
felt
his
breath
catch
at
the
thought.
"I
am."
"Miss
Neveu,"
Teabing
said,
"the
Church
and
the
Priory
have
had
a
tacit
understanding
for
years.
That
is,
the
Church
does
not
attack
the
Priory,
and
the
Priory
keeps
the
Sangreal
documents
hidden."
He
paused.
"However,
part
of
the
Priory
history
has
always
included
a
plan
to
unveil
the
secret.
With
the
arrival
of
a
specific
date
in
history,
the
brotherhood
plans
to
break
the
silence
and
carry
out
its
ultimate
triumph
by
unveiling
the
Sangreal
documents
to
the
world
and
shouting
the
true
story
of
Jesus
Christ
from
the
mountaintops."
Sophie
stared
at
Teabing
in
silence.
Finally,
she
too
sat
down.
"And
you
think
that
date
is
approaching?
And
the
Church
knows
it?"
"A
speculation,"
Teabing
said,
"but
it
would
certainly
provide
the
Church
motivation
for
an
all
out
attack
to
find
the
documents
before
it
was
too
late.
Langdon
had
the
uneasy
feeling
that
Teabing
was
making
good
sense.
"Do
you
think
the
Church
would
actually
be
capable
of
uncovering
hard
evidence
of
the
Priory's
date?"
"Why
not
if
we're
assuming
the
Church
was
able
to
uncover
the
identities
of
the
Priory
members,
then
certainly
they
could
have
learned
of
their
plans.
And
even
if
they
don't
have
the
exact
date,
their
superstitions
may
be
getting
the
best
of
them."
"Superstitions?"
Sophie
asked.
"In
terms
of
prophecy,"
Teabing
said,
"we
are
currently
in
an
epoch
of
enormous
change.
The
millennium
