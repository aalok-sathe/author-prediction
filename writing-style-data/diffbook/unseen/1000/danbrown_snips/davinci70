fireside
antiques
she
was
supposed
to
sit
on
the
Renaissance
velvet
divan,
the
rustic
eagle
claw
rocker,
or
the
pair
of
stone
pews
that
looked
like
they'd
been
lifted
from
some
Byzantine
temple.
Langdon
unwrapped
the
cryptex
from
his
coat,
walked
to
the
velvet
divan,
and
slid
the
wooden
box
deep
underneath
it,
well
out
of
sight.
Then,
shaking
out
his
jacket,
he
put
it
back
on,
smoothed
the
lapels,
and
smiled
at
Sophie
as
he
sat
down
directly
over
the
stashed
treasure.
The
divan
it
is,
Sophie
thought,
taking
a
seat
beside
him.
As
she
stared
into
the
growing
fire,
enjoying
the
warmth,
Sophie
had
the
sensation
that
her
grandfather
would
have
loved
this
room.
The
dark
wood
paneling
was
bedecked
with
Old
Master
paintings,
one
of
which
Sophie
recognized
as
a
Poussin,
her
grandfather's
second
favorite
painter.
On
the
mantel
above
the
fireplace,
an
alabaster
bust
of
Isis
watched
over
the
room.
Beneath
the
Egyptian
goddess,
inside
the
fireplace,
two
stone
gargoyles
served
as
andirons,
their
mouths
gaping
to
reveal
their
menacing
hollow
throats.
Gargoyles
had
always
terrified
Sophie
as
a
child;
that
was,
until
her
grandfather
cured
her
of
the
fear
by
taking
her
atop
Notre
Dame
Cathedral
in
a
rainstorm.
"Princess,
look
at
these
silly
creatures,"
he
had
told
her,
pointing
to
the
gargoyle
rainspouts
with
their
mouths
gushing
water.
"Do
you
hear
that
funny
sound
in
their
throats?"
Sophie
nodded,
having
to
smile
at
the
burping
sound
of
the
water
gurgling
through
their
throats.
"They're
gargling,
"
her
grandfather
told
her.
"Gargariser!
And
that's
where
they
get
the
silly
name
'gargoyles.'
"
Sophie
had
never
again
been
afraid.
The
fond
memory
caused
Sophie
a
pang
of
sadness
as
the
harsh
reality
of
the
murder
gripped
her
again.
Grand
pere
is
gone.
She
pictured
the
cryptex
under
the
divan
and
wondered
if
Leigh
Teabing
would
have
any
idea
how
to
open
it.
Or
if
we
even
should
ask
him.
Sophie's
grandfather's
final
words
had
instructed
her
to
find
Robert
Langdon.
He
had
said
nothing
about
involving
anyone
else.
We
needed
somewhere
to
hide,
Sophie
said,
deciding
to
trust
Robert's
judgment.
"Sir
Robert!"
a
voice
bellowed
somewhere
behind
them.
"I
see
you
travel
with
a
maiden."
Langdon
stood
up.
Sophie
jumped
to
her
feet
as
well.
The
voice
had
come
from
the
top
of
a
curled
staircase
that
snaked
up
to
the
shadows
of
the
second
floor.
At
the
top
of
the
stairs,
a
form
moved
in
the
shadows,
only
his
silhouette
visible.
"Good
evening,"
Langdon
called
up.
"Sir
Leigh,
may
I
present
Sophie
Neveu."
"An
honor."
Teabing
moved
into
the
light.
"Thank
you
for
having
us,"
Sophie
said,
now
seeing
the
man
wore
metal
leg
braces
and
used
crutches.
He
was
coming
down
one
stair
at
a
time.
"I
realize
it's
quite
late."
"It
is
so
late,
my
dear,
it's
early."
He
laughed.
"Vous
n'etes
pas
Americaine?"
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"Parisienne.
"Your
English
is
superb."
"Thank
you.
I
studied
at
the
Royal
Holloway."
"So
then,
that
explains
it."
Teabing
hobbled
lower
through
the
shadows.
"Perhaps
Robert
told
you
I
schooled
just
down
the
road
at
Oxford."
Teabing
fixed
Langdon
with
a
devilish
smile.
"Of
course,
I
also
applied
to
Harvard
as
my
safety
school."
Their
host
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs,
appearing
to
Sophie
no
more
like
a
knight
than
Sir
Elton
John.
Portly
and
ruby
faced,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
had
bushy
red
hair
and
jovial
hazel
eyes
that
seemed
to
twinkle
as
he
spoke.
He
wore
pleated
pants
and
a
roomy
silk
shirt
under
a
paisley
vest.
Despite
the
aluminum
braces
on
his
legs,
he
carried
himself
with
a
resilient,
vertical
dignity
that
seemed
more
a
by
product
of
noble
ancestry
than
any
kind
of
conscious
effort.
Teabing
arrived
and
extended
a
hand
to
Langdon.
"Robert,
you've
lost
weight."
Langdon
grinned.
"And
you've
found
some."
Teabing
laughed
heartily,
patting
his
rotund
belly.
"Touche.
My
only
carnal
pleasures
these
days
seem
to
be
culinary.
"
Turning
now
to
Sophie,
he
gently
took
her
hand,
bowing
his
head
slightly,
breathing
lightly
on
her
fingers,
and
diverting
his
eyes.
"M'lady."
Sophie
glanced
at
Langdon,
uncertain
whether
she'd
stepped
back
in
time
or
into
a
nuthouse.
The
butler
who
had
answered
the
door
now
entered
carrying
a
tea
service,
which
he
arranged
on
a
table
in
front
of
the
fireplace.
"This
is
Remy
Legaludec,"
Teabing
said,
"my
manservant."
The
slender
butler
gave
a
stiff
nod
and
disappeared
yet
again.
"Remy
is
Lyonais,
"
Teabing
whispered,
as
if
it
were
an
unfortunate
disease.
"But
he
does
sauces
quite
nicely."
Langdon
looked
amused.
"I
would
have
thought
you'd
import
an
English
staff?"
"Good
heavens,
no!
I
would
not
wish
a
British
chef
on
anyone
except
the
French
tax
collectors."
He
glanced
over
at
Sophie.
"Pardonnez
moi,
Mademoiselle
Neveu.
Please
be
assured
that
my
distaste
for
the
French
extends
only
to
politics
and
the
soccer
pitch.
Your
government
steals
my
money,
and
your
football
squad
recently
humiliated
us."
Sophie
offered
an
easy
smile.
Teabing
eyed
her
a
moment
and
then
looked
at
Langdon.
"Something
has
happened.
You
both
look
shaken.
Langdon
nodded.
"We've
had
an
interesting
night,
Leigh."
"No
doubt.
You
arrive
on
my
doorstep
unannounced
in
the
middle
of
the
night
speaking
of
the
Grail.
Tell
me,
is
this
indeed
about
the
Grail,
or
did
you
simply
say
that
because
you
know
it
is
the
lone
topic
for
which
I
would
rouse
myself
in
the
middle
of
the
night?"
A
little
of
both,
Sophie
thought,
picturing
the
cryptex
hidden
beneath
the
couch.
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
"we'd
like
to
talk
to
you
about
the
Priory
of
Sion."
Teabing's
bushy
eyebrows
arched
with
intrigue.
"The
keepers.
So
this
is
indeed
about
the
Grail.
You
say
you
come
with
information?
Something
new,
Robert?"
"Perhaps.
We're
not
quite
sure.
We
might
have
a
better
idea
if
we
could
get
some
information
from
you
first."
Teabing
wagged
his
finger.
"Ever
the
wily
American.
A
game
of
quid
pro
quo.
Very
well.
I
am
