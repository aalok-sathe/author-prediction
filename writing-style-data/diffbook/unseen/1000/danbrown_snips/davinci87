Collet
and
his
men
moved
room
by
room
through
the
huge
home,
securing
darkened
bedrooms
and
hallways
as
they
closed
in
on
the
sounds
of
voices.
The
sound
seemed
to
be
coming
from
the
last
bedroom
on
an
exceptionally
long
hallway.
The
agents
inched
down
the
corridor,
sealing
off
alternate
exits.
As
they
neared
the
final
bedroom,
Collet
could
see
the
door
was
wide
open.
The
voices
had
stopped
suddenly,
and
had
been
replaced
by
an
odd
rumbling,
like
an
engine.
Sidearm
raised,
Collet
gave
the
signal.
Reaching
silently
around
the
door
frame,
he
found
the
light
switch
and
flicked
it
on.
Spinning
into
the
room
with
men
pouring
in
after
him,
Collet
shouted
and
aimed
his
weapon
at
nothing.
An
empty
guest
bedroom.
Pristine.
The
rumbling
sounds
of
an
automobile
engine
poured
from
a
black
electronic
panel
on
the
wall
beside
the
bed.
Collet
had
seen
these
elsewhere
in
the
house.
Some
kind
of
intercom
system.
He
raced
over.
The
panel
had
about
a
dozen
labeled
buttons:
STUDY
KITCHEN
LAUNDRY
CELLAR
So
where
the
hell
do
I
hear
a
car?
MASTER
BEDROOM
SUN
ROOM
BARN
LIBRARY.
Barn!
Collet
was
downstairs
in
seconds,
running
toward
the
back
door,
grabbing
one
of
his
agents
on
the
way.
The
men
crossed
the
rear
lawn
and
arrived
breathless
at
the
front
of
a
weathered
gray
barn.
Even
before
they
entered,
Collet
could
hear
the
fading
sounds
of
a
car
engine.
He
drew
his
weapon,
rushed
in,
and
flicked
on
the
lights.
The
right
side
of
the
barn
was
a
rudimentary
workshop
lawn
mowers,
automotive
tools,
gardening
supplies.
A
familiar
intercom
panel
hung
on
the
wall
nearby.
One
of
its
buttons
was
flipped
down,
transmitting.
GUEST
BEDROOM
II.
Collet
wheeled,
anger
brimming.
They
lured
us
upstairs
with
the
intercom!
Searching
the
other
side
of
the
barn,
he
found
a
long
line
of
horse
stalls.
No
horses.
Apparently
the
owner
preferred
a
different
kind
of
horsepower;
the
stalls
had
been
converted
into
an
impressive
automotive
parking
facility.
The
collection
was
astonishing
a
black
Ferrari,
a
pristine
Rolls
Royce,
an
antique
Astin
Martin
sports
coupe,
a
vintage
Porsche
356.
The
last
stall
was
empty.
Collet
ran
over
and
saw
oil
stains
on
the
stall
floor.
They
can't
get
off
the
compound.
The
driveway
and
gate
were
barricaded
with
two
patrol
cars
to
prevent
this
very
situation.
"Sir?"
The
agent
pointed
down
the
length
of
the
stalls.
The
barn's
rear
slider
was
wide
open,
giving
way
to
a
dark,
muddy
slope
of
rugged
fields
that
stretched
out
into
the
night
behind
the
barn.
Collet
ran
to
the
door,
trying
to
see
out
into
the
darkness.
All
he
could
make
out
was
the
faint
shadow
of
a
forest
in
the
distance.
No
headlights.
This
wooded
valley
was
probably
crisscrossed
by
dozens
of
unmapped
fire
roads
and
hunting
trails,
but
Collet
was
confident
his
quarry
would
never
make
the
woods.
"Get
some
men
spread
out
down
there.
They're
probably
already
stuck
somewhere
nearby.
These
fancy
sports
cars
can't
handle
terrain."
"Urn,
sir?"
The
agent
pointed
to
a
nearby
pegboard
on
which
hung
several
sets
of
keys.
The
labels
above
the
keys
bore
familiar
names.
DAIMLER
ROLLS
ROYCE
ASTIN
MARTIN
PORSCHE
The
last
peg
was
empty.
When
Collet
read
the
label
above
the
empty
peg,
he
knew
he
was
in
trouble.
The
Range
Rover
was
Java
Black
Pearl,
four
wheel
drive,
standard
transmission,
with
high
strength
polypropylene
lamps,
rear
light
cluster
fittings,
and
the
steering
wheel
on
the
right.
Langdon
was
pleased
he
was
not
driving.
Teabing's
manservant
Remy,
on
orders
from
his
master,
was
doing
an
impressive
job
of
maneuvering
the
vehicle
across
the
moonlit
fields
behind
Chateau
Villette.
With
no
headlights,
he
had
crossed
an
open
knoll
and
was
now
descending
a
long
slope,
moving
farther
away
from
the
estate.
He
seemed
to
be
heading
toward
a
jagged
silhouette
of
wooded
land
in
the
distance.
Langdon,
cradling
the
keystone,
turned
in
the
passenger
seat
and
eyed
Teabing
and
Sophie
in
the
back
seat.
"How's
your
head,
Robert?"
Sophie
asked,
sounding
concerned.
Langdon
forced
a
pained
smile.
"Better,
thanks."
It
was
killing
him.
Beside
her,
Teabing
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
bound
and
gagged
monk
lying
in
the
cramped
luggage
area
behind
the
back
seat.
Teabing
had
the
monk's
gun
on
his
lap
and
looked
like
an
old
photo
of
a
British
safari
chap
posing
over
his
kill.
"So
glad
you
popped
in
this
evening,
Robert,"
Teabing
said,
grinning
as
if
he
were
having
fun
for
the
first
time
in
years.
"Sorry
to
get
you
involved
in
this,
Leigh."
"Oh,
please,
I've
waited
my
entire
life
to
be
involved."
Teabing
looked
past
Langdon
out
the
windshield
at
the
shadow
of
a
long
hedgerow.
He
tapped
Remy
on
the
shoulder
from
behind.
"Remember,
no
brake
lights.
Use
the
emergency
brake
if
you
need
it.
I
want
to
get
into
the
woods
a
bit.
No
reason
to
risk
them
seeing
us
from
the
house."
Remy
coasted
to
a
crawl
and
guided
the
Range
Rover
through
an
opening
in
the
hedge.
As
the
vehicle
lurched
onto
an
overgrown
pathway,
almost
immediately
the
trees
overhead
blotted
out
the
moonlight.
can
't
see
a
thing,
Langdon
thought,
straining
to
distinguish
any
shapes
at
all
in
front
of
them.
It
was
pitch
black.
Branches
rubbed
against
the
left
side
of
the
vehicle,
and
Remy
corrected
in
the
other
direction.
Keeping
the
wheel
more
or
less
straight
now,
he
inched
ahead
about
thirty
yards.
"You're
doing
beautifully,
Remy,"
Teabing
said.
"That
should
be
far
enough.
Robert,
if
you
could
press
that
little
blue
button
just
below
the
vent
there.
See
it?"
Langdon
found
the
button
and
pressed
it.
A
muted
yellow
glow
fanned
out
across
the
path
in
front
of
them,
revealing
thick
underbrush
on
either
side
of
the
pathway.
Fog
lights,
Langdon
realized.
They
gave
off
just
enough
light
to
keep
them
on
the
path,
and
yet
they
were
deep
enough
into
the
woods
now
that
the
lights
would
not
give
them
away.
"Well,
