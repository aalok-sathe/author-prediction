during
that
time
virtually
forbid
a
Jewish
man
to
be
unmarried.
According
to
Jewish
custom,
celibacy
was
condemned,
and
the
obligation
for
a
Jewish
father
was
to
find
a
suitable
wife
for
his
son.
If
Jesus
were
not
married,
at
least
one
of
the
Bible's
gospels
would
have
mentioned
it
and
offered
some
explanation
for
His
unnatural
state
of
bachelorhood."
Teabing
located
a
huge
book
and
pulled
it
toward
him
across
the
table.
The
leather
bound
edition
was
poster
sized,
like
a
huge
atlas.
The
cover
read:
The
Gnostic
Gospels.
Teabing
heaved
it
open,
and
Langdon
and
Sophie
joined
him.
Sophie
could
see
it
contained
photographs
of
what
appeared
to
be
magnified
passages
of
ancient
documents
tattered
papyrus
with
handwritten
text.
She
did
not
recognize
the
ancient
language,
but
the
facing
pages
bore
typed
translations.
"These
are
photocopies
of
the
Nag
Hammadi
and
Dead
Sea
scrolls,
which
I
mentioned
earlier,"
Teabing
said.
"The
earliest
Christian
records.
Troublingly,
they
do
not
match
up
with
the
gospels
in
the
Bible."
Flipping
toward
the
middle
of
the
book,
Teabing
pointed
to
a
passage.
"The
Gospel
of
Philip
is
always
a
good
place
to
start."
Sophie
read
the
passage:
And
the
companion
of
the
Saviour
is
Mary
Magdalene.
Christ
loved
her
more
than
all
the
disciples
and
used
to
kiss
her
often
on
her
mouth.
The
rest
of
the
disciples
were
offended
by
it
and
expressed
disapproval.
They
said
to
him,
"Why
do
you
love
her
more
than
all
of
us?"
The
words
surprised
Sophie,
and
yet
they
hardly
seemed
conclusive.
"It
says
nothing
of
marriage."
"Au
contraire.
"
Teabing
smiled,
pointing
to
the
first
line.
"As
any
Aramaic
scholar
will
tell
you,
the
word
companion,
in
those
days,
literally
meant
spouse.
Langdon
concurred
with
a
nod.
Sophie
read
the
first
line
again.
And
the
companion
of
the
Saviour
is
Mary
Magdalene.
Teabing
flipped
through
the
book
and
pointed
out
several
other
passages
that,
to
Sophie's
surprise,
clearly
suggested
Magdalene
and
Jesus
had
a
romantic
relationship.
As
she
read
the
passages,
Sophie
recalled
an
angry
priest
who
had
banged
on
her
grandfather's
door
when
she
was
a
schoolgirl.
"Is
this
the
home
of
Jacques
Sauniere?"
the
priest
had
demanded,
glaring
down
at
young
Sophie
when
she
pulled
open
the
door.
"I
want
to
talk
to
him
about
this
editorial
he
wrote."
The
priest
held
up
a
newspaper.
Sophie
summoned
her
grandfather,
and
the
two
men
disappeared
into
his
study
and
closed
the
door.
My
grandfather
wrote
something
in
the
paper?
Sophie
immediately
ran
to
the
kitchen
and
flipped
through
that
morning's
paper.
She
found
her
grandfather's
name
on
an
article
on
the
second
page.
She
read
it.
Sophie
didn't
understand
all
of
what
was
said,
but
it
sounded
like
the
French
government,
under
pressure
from
priests,
had
agreed
to
ban
an
American
movie
called
The
Last
Temptation
of
Christ,
which
was
about
Jesus
having
sex
with
a
lady
called
Mary
Magdalene.
Her
grandfather's
article
said
the
Church
was
arrogant
and
wrong
to
ban
it.
No
wonder
the
priest
is
mad,
Sophie
thought.
"It's
pornography!
Sacrilege!"
the
priest
yelled,
emerging
from
the
study
and
storming
to
the
front
door.
"How
can
you
possibly
endorse
that!
This
American
Martin
Scorsese
is
a
blasphemer,
and
the
Church
will
permit
him
no
pulpit
in
France
!
"
The
priest
slammed
the
door
on
his
way
out.
When
her
grandfather
came
into
the
kitchen,
he
saw
Sophie
with
the
paper
and
frowned.
"You're
quick."
Sophie
said,
"You
think
Jesus
Christ
had
a
girlfriend?"
"No,
dear,
I
said
the
Church
should
not
be
allowed
to
tell
us
what
notions
we
can
and
can't
entertain.
"Did
Jesus
have
a
girlfriend?"
Her
grandfather
was
silent
for
several
moments.
"Would
it
be
so
bad
if
He
did?"
Sophie
considered
it
and
then
shrugged.
"I
wouldn't
mind."
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
was
still
talking.
"I
shan't
bore
you
with
the
countless
references
to
Jesus
and
Magdalene's
union.
That
has
been
explored
ad
nauseum
by
modern
historians.
I
would,
however,
like
to
point
out
the
following."
He
motioned
to
another
passage.
"This
is
from
the
Gospel
of
Mary
Magdalene."
Sophie
had
not
known
a
gospel
existed
in
Magdalene's
words.
She
read
the
text:
And
Peter
said,
"Did
the
Saviour
really
speak
with
a
woman
without
our
knowledge
?
Are
we
to
turn
about
and
all
listen
to
her?
Did
he
prefer
her
to
us?"
And
Levi
answered,
"Peter,
you
have
always
been
hot
tempered.
Now
I
see
you
contending
against
the
woman
like
an
adversary.
If
the
Saviour
made
her
worthy,
who
are
you
indeed
to
reject
her?
Surely
the
Saviour
knows
her
very
well.
That
is
why
he
loved
her
more
than
us.
"The
woman
they
are
speaking
of,"
Teabing
explained,
"is
Mary
Magdalene.
Peter
is
jealous
of
her."
"Because
Jesus
preferred
Mary?"
"Not
only
that.
The
stakes
were
far
greater
than
mere
affection.
At
this
point
in
the
gospels,
Jesus
suspects
He
will
soon
be
captured
and
crucified.
So
He
gives
Mary
Magdalene
instructions
on
how
to
carry
on
His
Church
after
He
is
gone.
As
a
result,
Peter
expresses
his
discontent
over
playing
second
fiddle
to
a
woman.
I
daresay
Peter
was
something
of
a
sexist."
Sophie
was
trying
to
keep
up.
"This
is
Saint
Peter.
The
rock
on
which
Jesus
built
His
Church."
"The
same,
except
for
one
catch.
According
to
these
unaltered
gospels,
it
was
not
Peter
to
whom
Christ
gave
directions
with
which
to
establish
the
Christian
Church.
It
was
Mary
Magdalene.
Sophie
looked
at
him.
"You're
saying
the
Christian
Church
was
to
be
carried
on
by
a
woman?"
"That
was
the
plan.
Jesus
was
the
original
feminist.
He
intended
for
the
future
of
His
Church
to
be
in
the
hands
of
Mary
Magdalene."
"And
Peter
had
a
problem
with
that,"
Langdon
said,
pointing
to
The
Last
Supper.
"That's
Peter
there.
You
can
see
that
Da
Vinci
was
well
aware
of
how
Peter
felt
about
Mary
Magdalene."
Again,
Sophie
was
speechless.
In
the
painting,
Peter
was
leaning
menacingly
toward
Mary
