I'm
with
eight
men
total.
Four
of
us
have
field
rifles
and
the
others
have
sidearms."
"Wait
for
me."
"Captain,
what
if
Langdon
has
a
hostage
in
there?
What
if
he
sees
us
and
decides
to
leave
on
foot?
We
need
to
move
now!
My
men
are
in
position
and
ready
to
go."
"Lieutenant
Collet,
you
will
wait
for
me
to
arrive
before
taking
action.
That
is
an
order."
Fache
hung
up.
Stunned,
Lieutenant
Collet
switched
off
his
phone.
Why
the
hell
is
Fache
asking
me
to
wait?
Collet
knew
the
answer.
Fache,
though
famous
for
his
instinct,
was
notorious
for
his
pride.
Fache
wants
credit
for
the
arrest.
After
putting
the
American's
face
all
over
the
television,
Fache
wanted
to
be
sure
his
own
face
got
equal
time.
Collet's
job
was
simply
to
hold
down
the
fort
until
the
boss
showed
up
to
save
the
day.
As
he
stood
there,
Collet
flashed
on
a
second
possible
explanation
for
this
delay.
Damage
control.
In
law
enforcement,
hesitating
to
arrest
a
fugitive
only
occurred
when
uncertainty
had
arisen
regarding
the
suspect's
guilt.
Is
Fache
having
second
thoughts
that
Langdon
is
the
right
man
?
The
thought
was
frightening.
Captain
Fache
had
gone
out
on
a
limb
tonight
to
arrest
Robert
Langdon
surveillance
cachee,
Interpol,
and
now
television.
Not
even
the
great
Bezu
Fache
would
survive
the
political
fallout
if
he
had
mistakenly
splashed
a
prominent
American's
face
all
over
French
television,
claiming
he
was
a
murderer.
If
Fache
now
realized
he'd
made
a
mistake,
then
it
made
perfect
sense
that
he
would
tell
Collet
not
to
make
a
move.
The
last
thing
Fache
needed
was
for
Collet
to
storm
an
innocent
Brit's
private
estate
and
take
Langdon
at
gunpoint.
Moreover,
Collet
realized,
if
Langdon
were
innocent,
it
explained
one
of
this
case's
strangest
paradoxes:
Why
had
Sophie
Neveu,
the
granddaughter
of
the
victim,
helped
the
alleged
killer
escape?
Unless
Sophie
knew
Langdon
was
falsely
charged.
Fache
had
posited
all
kinds
of
explanations
tonight
to
explain
Sophie's
odd
behavior,
including
that
Sophie,
as
Sauniere's
sole
heir,
had
persuaded
her
secret
lover
Robert
Langdon
to
kill
off
Sauniere
for
the
inheritance
money.
Sauniere,
if
he
had
suspected
this,
might
have
left
the
police
the
message
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Collet
was
fairly
certain
something
else
was
going
on
here.
Sophie
Neveu
seemed
far
too
solid
of
character
to
be
mixed
up
in
something
that
sordid.
"Lieutenant?"
One
of
the
field
agents
came
running
over.
"We
found
a
car."
Collet
followed
the
agent
about
fifty
yards
past
the
driveway.
The
agent
pointed
to
a
wide
shoulder
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road.
There,
parked
in
the
brush,
almost
out
of
sight,
was
a
black
Audi.
It
had
rental
plates.
Collet
felt
the
hood.
Still
warm.
Hot
even.
"That
must
be
how
Langdon
got
here,"
Collet
said.
"Call
the
rental
company.
Find
out
if
it's
stolen."
"Yes,
sir."
Another
agent
waved
Collet
back
over
in
the
direction
of
the
fence.
"Lieutenant,
have
a
look
at
this."
He
handed
Collet
a
pair
of
night
vision
binoculars.
"The
grove
of
trees
near
the
top
of
the
driveway."
Collet
aimed
the
binoculars
up
the
hill
and
adjusted
the
image
intensifier
dials.
Slowly,
the
greenish
shapes
came
into
focus.
He
located
the
curve
of
the
driveway
and
slowly
followed
it
up,
reaching
the
grove
of
trees.
All
he
could
do
was
stare.
There,
shrouded
in
the
greenery,
was
an
armored
truck.
A
truck
identical
to
the
one
Collet
had
permitted
to
leave
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
earlier
tonight.
He
prayed
this
was
some
kind
of
bizarre
coincidence,
but
he
knew
it
could
not
be.
"It
seems
obvious,"
the
agent
said,
"that
this
truck
is
how
Langdon
and
Neveu
got
away
from
the
bank."
Collet
was
speechless.
He
thought
of
the
armored
truck
driver
he
had
stopped
at
the
roadblock.
The
Rolex.
His
impatience
to
leave.
never
checked
the
cargo
hold.
Incredulous,
Collet
realized
that
someone
in
the
bank
had
actually
lied
to
DCPJ
about
Langdon
and
Sophie's
whereabouts
and
then
helped
them
escape.
But
who?
And
why?
Collet
wondered
if
maybe
this
were
the
reason
Fache
had
told
him
not
to
take
action
yet.
Maybe
Fache
realized
there
were
more
people
involved
tonight
than
just
Langdon
and
Sophie.
And
if
Langdon
and
Neveu
arrived
in
the
armored
truck,
then
who
drove
the
Audi?
Hundreds
of
miles
to
the
south,
a
chartered
Beechcraft
Baron
58
raced
northward
over
the
Tyrrhenian
Sea.
Despite
calm
skies,
Bishop
Aringarosa
clutched
an
airsickness
bag,
certain
he
could
be
ill
at
any
moment.
His
conversation
with
Paris
had
not
at
all
been
what
he
had
imagined.
Alone
in
the
small
cabin,
Aringarosa
twisted
the
gold
ring
on
his
finger
and
tried
to
ease
his
overwhelming
sense
of
fear
and
desperation.
Everything
in
Paris
has
gone
terribly
wrong.
Closing
his
eyes,
Aringarosa
said
a
prayer
that
Bezu
Fache
would
have
the
means
to
fix
it.
Teabing
sat
on
the
divan,
cradling
the
wooden
box
on
his
lap
and
admiring
the
lid's
intricate
inlaid
Rose.
Tonight
has
become
the
strangest
and
most
magical
night
of
my
life.
"Lift
the
lid,"
Sophie
whispered,
standing
over
him,
beside
Langdon.
Teabing
smiled.
Do
not
rush
me.
Having
spent
over
a
decade
searching
for
this
keystone,
he
wanted
to
savor
every
millisecond
of
this
moment.
He
ran
a
palm
across
the
wooden
lid,
feeling
the
texture
of
the
inlaid
flower.
"The
Rose,"
he
whispered.
The
Rose
is
Magdalene
is
the
Holy
Grail.
The
Rose
is
the
compass
that
guides
the
way.
Teabing
felt
foolish.
For
years
he
had
traveled
to
cathedrals
and
churches
all
over
France,
paying
for
special
access,
examining
hundreds
of
archways
beneath
rose
windows,
searching
for
an
encrypted
keystone.
La
clef
de
voute
a
stone
key
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
Teabing
slowly
unlatched
the
lid
and
raised
it.
As
his
eyes
finally
gazed
upon
the
contents,
he
knew
in
an
instant
it
could
only
be
the
keystone.
He
was
staring
at
a
stone
cylinder,
