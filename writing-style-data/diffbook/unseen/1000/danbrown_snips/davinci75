is!"
Sophie
was
certain
she
had
missed
something.
"That's
the
same
painting
you
just
showed
me."
He
winked.
"I
know,
but
the
enlargement
is
so
much
more
exciting.
Don't
you
think?"
Sophie
turned
to
Langdon
for
help.
"I'm
lost."
Langdon
smiled.
"As
it
turns
out,
the
Holy
Grail
does
indeed
make
an
appearance
in
The
Last
Supper.
Leonardo
included
her
prominently."
"Hold
on,"
Sophie
said.
"You
told
me
the
Holy
Grail
is
a
woman.
The
Last
Supper
is
a
painting
of
thirteen
men."
"Is
it?"
Teabing
arched
his
eyebrows.
"Take
a
closer
look."
Uncertain,
Sophie
made
her
way
closer
to
the
painting,
scanning
the
thirteen
figures
Jesus
Christ
in
the
middle,
six
disciples
on
His
left,
and
six
on
His
right.
"They're
all
men,"
she
confirmed.
"Oh?"
Teabing
said.
"How
about
the
one
seated
in
the
place
of
honor,
at
the
right
hand
of
the
Lord?"
Sophie
examined
the
figure
to
Jesus'
immediate
right,
focusing
in.
As
she
studied
the
person's
face
and
body,
a
wave
of
astonishment
rose
within
her.
The
individual
had
flowing
red
hair,
delicate
folded
hands,
and
the
hint
of
a
bosom.
It
was,
without
a
doubt
female.
"That's
a
woman!"
Sophie
exclaimed.
Teabing
was
laughing.
"Surprise,
surprise.
Believe
me,
it's
no
mistake.
Leonardo
was
skilled
at
painting
the
difference
between
the
sexes."
Sophie
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
the
woman
beside
Christ.
The
Last
Supper
is
supposed
to
be
thirteen
men.
Who
is
this
woman?
Although
Sophie
had
seen
this
classic
image
many
times,
she
had
not
once
noticed
this
glaring
discrepancy.
"Everyone
misses
it,"
Teabing
said.
"Our
preconceived
notions
of
this
scene
are
so
powerful
that
our
mind
blocks
out
the
incongruity
and
overrides
our
eyes."
"It's
known
as
skitoma,
"
Langdon
added.
"The
brain
does
it
sometimes
with
powerful
symbols."
"Another
reason
you
might
have
missed
the
woman,"
Teabing
said,
"is
that
many
of
the
photographs
in
art
books
were
taken
before
1954,
when
the
details
were
still
hidden
beneath
layers
of
grime
and
several
restorative
repaintings
done
by
clumsy
hands
in
the
eighteenth
century.
Now,
at
last,
the
fresco
has
been
cleaned
down
to
Da
Vinci's
original
layer
of
paint."
He
motioned
to
the
photograph.
"Etvoilaf"
Sophie
moved
closer
to
the
image.
The
woman
to
Jesus'
right
was
young
and
pious
looking,
with
a
demure
face,
beautiful
red
hair,
and
hands
folded
quietly.
This
is
the
woman
who
singlehandedly
could
crumble
the
Church?
"Who
is
she?"
Sophie
asked.
"That,
my
dear,"
Teabing
replied,
"is
Mary
Magdalene."
Sophie
turned.
"The
prostitute?"
Teabing
drew
a
short
breath,
as
if
the
word
had
injured
him
personally.
"Magdalene
was
no
such
thing.
That
unfortunate
misconception
is
the
legacy
of
a
smear
campaign
launched
by
the
early
Church.
The
Church
needed
to
defame
Mary
Magdalene
in
order
to
cover
up
her
dangerous
secret
her
role
as
the
Holy
Grail."
"Herroe?"
"As
I
mentioned,"
Teabing
clarified,
"the
early
Church
needed
to
convince
the
world
that
the
mortal
prophet
Jesus
was
a
divine
being.
Therefore,
any
gospels
that
described
earthly
aspects
of
Jesus'
life
had
to
be
omitted
from
the
Bible.
Unfortunately
for
the
early
editors,
one
particularly
troubling
earthly
theme
kept
recurring
in
the
gospels.
Mary
Magdalene."
He
paused.
"More
specifically,
her
marriage
to
Jesus
Christ."
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
Sophie's
eyes
moved
to
Langdon
and
then
back
to
Teabing.
"It's
a
matter
of
historical
record,"
Teabing
said,
"and
Da
Vinci
was
certainly
aware
of
that
fact.
The
Last
Supper
practically
shouts
at
the
viewer
that
Jesus
and
Magdalene
were
a
pair.
Sophie
glanced
back
to
the
fresco.
"Notice
that
Jesus
and
Magdalene
are
clothed
as
mirror
images
of
one
another."
Teabing
pointed
to
the
two
individuals
in
the
center
of
the
fresco.
Sophie
was
mesmerized.
Sure
enough,
their
clothes
were
inverse
colors.
Jesus
wore
a
red
robe
and
blue
cloak;
Mary
Magdalene
wore
a
blue
robe
and
red
cloak.
Yin
and
yang.
"Venturing
into
the
more
bizarre,"
Teabing
said,
"note
that
Jesus
and
His
bride
appear
to
be
joined
at
the
hip
and
are
leaning
away
from
one
another
as
if
to
create
this
clearly
delineated
negative
space
between
them."
Even
before
Teabing
traced
the
contour
for
her,
Sophie
saw
it
the
indisputable
V
shape
at
the
focal
point
of
the
painting.
It
was
the
same
symbol
Langdon
had
drawn
earlier
for
the
Grail,
the
chalice,
and
the
female
womb.
"Finally,"
Teabing
said,
"if
you
view
Jesus
and
Magdalene
as
compositional
elements
rather
than
as
people,
you
will
see
another
obvious
shape
leap
out
at
you."
He
paused.
"A
letter
of
the
alphabet."
Sophie
saw
it
at
once.
To
say
the
letter
leapt
out
at
her
was
an
understatement.
The
letter
was
suddenly
all
Sophie
could
see.
Glaring
in
the
center
of
the
painting
was
the
unquestionable
outline
of
an
enormous,
flawlessly
formed
letter
M.
"A
bit
too
perfect
for
coincidence,
wouldn't
you
say?"
Teabing
asked.
Sophie
was
amazed.
"Why
is
it
there?"
Teabing
shrugged.
"Conspiracy
theorists
will
tell
you
it
stands
for
Matrimonio
or
Mary
Magdalene.
To
be
honest,
nobody
is
certain.
The
only
certainty
is
that
the
hidden
M
is
no
mistake.
Countless
Grail
related
works
contain
the
hidden
letter
M
whether
as
watermarks,
underpaintings,
or
compositional
allusions.
The
most
blatant
M,
of
course,
is
emblazoned
on
the
altar
at
Our
Lady
of
Paris
in
London,
which
was
designed
by
a
former
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion,
Jean
Cocteau."
Sophie
weighed
the
information.
"I'll
admit,
the
hidden
M's
are
intriguing,
although
I
assume
nobody
is
claiming
they
are
proof
of
Jesus'
marriage
to
Magdalene."
"No,
no,"
Teabing
said,
going
to
a
nearby
table
of
books.
"As
I
said
earlier,
the
marriage
of
Jesus
and
Mary
Magdalene
is
part
of
the
historical
record.
"
He
began
pawing
through
his
book
collection.
"Moreover,
Jesus
as
a
married
man
makes
infinitely
more
sense
than
our
standard
biblical
view
of
Jesus
as
a
bachelor.
"Why?"
Sophie
asked.
"Because
Jesus
was
a
Jew,"
Langdon
said,
taking
over
while
Teabing
searched
for
his
book,
"and
the
social
decorum
