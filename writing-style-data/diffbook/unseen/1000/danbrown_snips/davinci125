family
had
been
murdered?
What
did
she
truly
know
about
the
crash
that
took
her
family?
Only
sketchy
details.
Even
the
stories
in
the
newspaper
had
been
vague.
An
accident?
Bedtime
stories?
Sophie
flashed
suddenly
on
her
grandfather's
overprotectiveness,
how
he
never
liked
to
leave
her
alone
when
she
was
young.
Even
when
Sophie
was
grown
and
away
at
university,
she
had
the
sense
her
grandfather
was
watching
over.
She
wondered
if
there
had
been
Priory
members
in
the
shadows
throughout
her
entire
life,
looking
after
her.
"You
suspected
he
was
being
manipulated,"
Langdon
said,
glaring
with
disbelief
at
Teabing.
"So
you
murdered
him?"
"I
did
not
pull
the
trigger,"
Teabing
said.
"Sauniere
was
dead
years
ago,
when
the
Church
stole
his
family
from
him.
He
was
compromised.
Now
he
is
free
of
that
pain,
released
from
the
shame
caused
by
his
inability
to
carry
out
his
sacred
duty.
Consider
the
alternative.
Something
had
to
be
done.
Shall
the
world
be
ignorant
forever?
Shall
the
Church
be
allowed
to
cement
its
lies
into
our
history
books
for
all
eternity?
Shall
the
Church
be
permitted
to
influence
indefinitely
with
murder
and
extortion?
No,
something
needed
to
be
done!
And
now
we
are
poised
to
carry
out
Sauniere's
legacy
and
right
a
terrible
wrong."
He
paused.
"The
three
of
us.
Together."
Sophie
felt
only
incredulity.
"How
could
you
possibly
believe
that
we
would
help
you?"
"Because,
my
dear,
you
are
the
reason
the
Priory
failed
to
release
the
documents.
Your
grandfather's
love
for
you
prevented
him
from
challenging
the
Church.
His
fear
of
reprisal
against
his
only
remaining
family
crippled
him.
He
never
had
a
chance
to
explain
the
truth
because
you
rejected
him,
tying
his
hands,
making
him
wait.
Now
you
owe
the
world
the
truth.
You
owe
it
to
the
memory
of
your
grandfather."
Robert
Langdon
had
given
up
trying
to
get
his
bearings.
Despite
the
torrent
of
questions
running
through
his
mind,
he
knew
only
one
thing
mattered
now
getting
Sophie
out
of
here
alive.
All
the
guilt
Langdon
had
mistakenly
felt
earlier
for
involving
Teabing
had
now
been
transferred
to
Sophie.
took
her
to
Chateau
Villette.
I
am
responsible.
Langdon
could
not
fathom
that
Leigh
Teabing
would
be
capable
of
killing
them
in
cold
blood
here
in
the
Chapter
House,
and
yet
Teabing
certainly
had
been
involved
in
killing
others
during
his
misguided
quest.
Langdon
had
the
uneasy
feeling
that
gunshots
in
this
secluded,
thick
walled
chamber
would
go
unheard,
especially
in
this
rain.
And
Leigh
just
admitted
his
guilt
to
us.
Langdon
glanced
at
Sophie,
who
looked
shaken.
The
Church
murdered
Sophie
's
family
to
silence
the
Priory?
Langdon
felt
certain
the
modern
Church
did
not
murder
people.
There
had
to
be
some
other
explanation.
"Let
Sophie
leave,"
Langdon
declared,
staring
at
Leigh.
"You
and
I
should
discuss
this
alone."
Teabing
gave
an
unnatural
laugh.
"I'm
afraid
that
is
one
show
of
faith
I
cannot
afford.
I
can,
however,
offer
you
this.
"
He
propped
himself
fully
on
his
crutches,
gracelessly
keeping
the
gun
aimed
at
Sophie,
and
removed
the
keystone
from
his
pocket.
He
swayed
a
bit
as
he
held
it
out
for
Langdon.
"A
token
of
trust,
Robert."
Robert
felt
wary
and
didn't
move.
Leigh
is
giving
the
keystone
back
to
us?
"Take
it,"
Teabing
said,
thrusting
it
awkwardly
toward
Langdon.
Langdon
could
imagine
only
one
reason
Teabing
would
give
it
back.
"You
opened
it
already.
You
removed
the
map."
Teabing
was
shaking
his
head.
"Robert,
if
I
had
solved
the
keystone,
I
would
have
disappeared
to
find
the
Grail
myself
and
kept
you
uninvolved.
No,
I
do
not
know
the
answer.
And
I
can
admit
that
freely.
A
true
knight
learns
humility
in
the
face
of
the
Grail.
He
learns
to
obey
the
signs
placed
before
him.
When
I
saw
you
enter
the
abbey,
I
understood.
You
were
here
for
a
reason.
To
help.
I
am
not
looking
for
singular
glory
here.
I
serve
a
far
greater
master
than
my
own
pride.
The
Truth.
Mankind
deserves
to
know
that
truth.
The
Grail
found
us
all,
and
now
she
is
begging
to
be
revealed.
We
must
work
together."
Despite
Teabing's
pleas
for
cooperation
and
trust,
his
gun
remained
trained
on
Sophie
as
Langdon
stepped
forward
and
accepted
the
cold
marble
cylinder.
The
vinegar
inside
gurgled
as
Langdon
grasped
it
and
stepped
backward.
The
dials
were
still
in
random
order,
and
the
cryptex
remained
locked.
Langdon
eyed
Teabing.
"How
do
you
know
I
won't
smash
it
right
now?"
Teabing's
laugh
was
an
eerie
chortle.
"I
should
have
realized
your
threat
to
break
it
in
the
Temple
Church
was
an
empty
one.
Robert
Langdon
would
never
break
the
keystone.
You
are
an
historian,
Robert.
You
are
holding
the
key
to
two
thousand
years
of
history
the
lost
key
to
the
Sangreal.
You
can
feel
the
souls
of
all
the
knights
burned
at
the
stake
to
protect
her
secret.
Would
you
have
them
die
in
vain?
No,
you
will
vindicate
them.
You
will
join
the
ranks
of
the
great
men
you
admire
Da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
Newton
each
of
whom
would
have
been
honored
to
be
in
your
shoes
right
now.
The
contents
of
the
keystone
are
crying
out
to
us.
Longing
to
be
set
free.
The
time
has
come.
Destiny
has
led
us
to
this
moment."
"I
cannot
help
you,
Leigh.
I
have
no
idea
how
to
open
this.
I
only
saw
Newton's
tomb
for
a
moment.
And
even
if
I
knew
the
password"
Langdon
paused,
realizing
he
had
said
too
much.
"You
would
not
tell
me?"
Teabing
sighed.
"I
am
disappointed
and
surprised,
Robert,
that
you
do
not
appreciate
the
extent
to
which
you
are
in
my
debt.
My
task
would
have
been
far
simpler
had
Remy
and
I
eliminated
you
both
when
you
walked
into
Chateau
Villette.
Instead
I
risked
everything
to
take
the
nobler
course."
"This
is
noble?"
Langdon
demanded,
eyeing
the
gun.
"Sauniere's
fault,"
Teabing
said.
"He
and
his
senechaux
lied
to
Silas.
Otherwise,
