foreign
sales.
Sauniere
was
a
no
brainer.
The
silence
on
the
other
end
lasted
a
long
time.
"When
did
you
send
it?"
"About
a
month
ago.
I
also
mentioned
you
would
be
in
Paris
soon
and
suggested
you
two
chat.
Did
he
ever
call
you
to
meet?"
Faukman
paused,
rubbing
his
eyes.
"Hold
on,
aren't
you
supposed
to
be
in
Paris
this
week?"
"lam
in
Paris."
Faukman
sat
upright.
"You
called
me
collect
from
Paris?"
"Take
it
out
of
my
royalties,
Jonas.
Did
you
ever
hear
back
from
Sauniere?
Did
he
like
the
manuscript?"
"I
don't
know.
I
haven't
yet
heard
from
him."
"Well,
don't
hold
your
breath.
I've
got
to
run,
but
this
explains
a
lot
Thanks."
"Robert"
But
Langdon
was
gone.
Faukman
hung
up
the
phone,
shaking
his
head
in
disbelief
Authors,
he
thought.
Even
the
sane
ones
are
nuts.
Inside
the
Range
Rover,
Leigh
Teabing
let
out
a
guffaw.
"Robert,
you're
saying
you
wrote
a
manuscript
that
delves
into
a
secret
society,
and
your
editor
sent
a
copy
to
that
secret
society?"
Langdon
slumped.
"Evidently."
"A
cruel
coincidence,
my
friend."
Coincidence
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
Langdon
knew.
Asking
Jacques
Sauniere
to
endorse
a
manuscript
on
goddess
worship
was
as
obvious
as
asking
Tiger
Woods
to
endorse
a
book
on
golf.
Moreover,
it
was
virtually
guaranteed
that
any
book
on
goddess
worship
would
have
to
mention
the
Priory
of
Sion.
"Here's
the
million
dollar
question,"
Teabing
said,
still
chuckling.
"Was
your
position
on
the
Priory
favorable
or
unfavorable?"
Langdon
could
hear
Teabing's
true
meaning
loud
and
clear.
Many
historians
questioned
why
the
Priory
was
still
keeping
the
Sangreal
documents
hidden.
Some
felt
the
information
should
have
been
shared
with
the
world
long
ago.
"I
took
no
position
on
the
Priory's
actions."
"You
mean
lack
thereof."
Langdon
shrugged.
Teabing
was
apparently
on
the
side
of
making
the
documents
public.
"I
simply
provided
history
on
the
brotherhood
and
described
them
as
a
modern
goddess
worship
society,
keepers
of
the
Grail,
and
guardians
of
ancient
documents."
Sophie
looked
at
him.
"Did
you
mention
the
keystone?"
Langdon
winced.
He
had.
Numerous
times.
"I
talked
about
the
supposed
keystone
as
an
example
of
the
lengths
to
which
the
Priory
would
go
to
protect
the
Sangreal
documents."
Sophie
looked
amazed.
"I
guess
that
explains
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Langdon
sensed
it
was
actually
something
else
in
the
manuscript
that
had
piqued
Sauniere's
interest,
but
that
topic
was
something
he
would
discuss
with
Sophie
when
they
were
alone.
"So,"
Sophie
said,
"you
lied
to
Captain
Fache."
"What?"
Langdon
demanded.
"You
told
him
you
had
never
corresponded
with
my
grandfather."
"I
didn't!
My
editor
sent
him
a
manuscript."
"Think
about
it,
Robert.
If
Captain
Fache
didn't
find
the
envelope
in
which
your
editor
sent
the
manuscript,
he
would
have
to
conclude
that
you
sent
it."
She
paused.
"Or
worse,
that
you
hand
delivered
it
and
lied
about
it.
When
the
Range
Rover
arrived
at
Le
Bourget
Airfield,
Remy
drove
to
a
small
hangar
at
the
far
end
of
the
airstrip.
As
they
approached,
a
tousled
man
in
wrinkled
khakis
hurried
from
the
hangar,
waved,
and
slid
open
the
enormous
corrugated
metal
door
to
reveal
a
sleek
white
jet
within.
Langdon
stared
at
the
glistening
fuselage.
"That's
Elizabeth?"
Teabing
grinned.
"Beats
the
bloody
Chunnel."
The
man
in
khakis
hurried
toward
them,
squinting
into
the
headlights.
"Almost
ready,
sir,"
he
called
in
a
British
accent.
"My
apologies
for
the
delay,
but
you
took
me
by
surprise
and
"
He
stopped
short
as
the
group
unloaded.
He
looked
at
Sophie
and
Langdon,
and
then
Teabing.
Teabing
said,
"My
associates
and
I
have
urgent
business
in
London.
We've
no
time
to
waste.
Please
prepare
to
depart
immediately."
As
he
spoke,
Teabing
took
the
pistol
out
of
the
vehicle
and
handed
it
to
Langdon.
The
pilot's
eyes
bulged
at
the
sight
of
the
weapon.
He
walked
over
to
Teabing
and
whispered,
"Sir,
my
humble
apologies,
but
my
diplomatic
flight
allowance
provides
only
for
you
and
your
manservant.
I
cannot
take
your
guests."
"Richard,"
Teabing
said,
smiling
warmly,
"two
thousand
pounds
sterling
and
that
loaded
gun
say
you
can
take
my
guests."
He
motioned
to
the
Range
Rover.
"And
the
unfortunate
fellow
in
the
back."
The
Hawker
731's
twin
Garrett
TFE

engines
thundered,
powering
the
plane
skyward
with
gut
wrenching
force.
Outside
the
window,
Le
Bourget
Airfield
dropped
away
with
startling
speed.
I'm
fleeing
the
country,
Sophie
thought,
her
body
forced
back
into
the
leather
seat.
Until
this
moment,
she
had
believed
her
game
of
cat
and
mouse
with
Fache
would
be
somehow
justifiable
to
the
Ministry
of
Defense.
was
attempting
to
protect
an
innocent
man.
I
was
trying
to
fulfill
my
grandfather's
dying
wishes.
That
window
of
opportunity,
Sophie
knew,
had
just
closed.
She
was
leaving
the
country,
without
documentation,
accompanying
a
wanted
man,
and
transporting
a
bound
hostage.
If
a
"line
of
reason"
had
ever
existed,
she
had
just
crossed
it.
At
almost
the
speed
of
sound.
Sophie
was
seated
with
Langdon
and
Teabing
near
the
front
of
the
cabin
the
Fan
Jet
Executive
Elite
Design,
according
to
the
gold
medallion
on
the
door.
Their
plush
swivel
chairs
were
bolted
to
tracks
on
the
floor
and
could
be
repositioned
and
locked
around
a
rectangular
hardwood
table.
A
mini
boardroom.
The
dignified
surroundings,
however,
did
little
to
camouflage
the
less
than
dignified
state
of
affairs
in
the
rear
of
the
plane
where,
in
a
separate
seating
area
near
the
rest
room,
Teabing's
manservant
Remy
sat
with
the
pistol
in
hand,
begrudgingly
carrying
out
Teabing's
orders
to
stand
guard
over
the
bloody
monk
who
lay
trussed
at
his
feet
like
a
piece
of
luggage.
"Before
we
turn
our
attention
to
the
keystone,"
Teabing
said,
"I
was
wondering
if
you
would
permit
me
a
few
words."
He
sounded
apprehensive,
like
a
father
about
to
give
the
birds
and
the
bees
lecture
to
his
children.
"My
friends,
I
realize
I
am
but
a
guest
on
this
journey,
and
I
am
honored
