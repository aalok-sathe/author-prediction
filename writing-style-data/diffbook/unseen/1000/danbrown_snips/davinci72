kind
of
hybrid
religion
that
was
acceptable
to
both
parties."
"Transmogrification,"
Langdon
said.
"The
vestiges
of
pagan
religion
in
Christian
symbology
are
undeniable.
Egyptian
sun
disks
became
the
halos
of
Catholic
saints.
Pictograms
of
Isis
nursing
her
miraculously
conceived
son
Horus
became
the
blueprint
for
our
modern
images
of
the
Virgin
Mary
nursing
Baby
Jesus.
And
virtually
all
the
elements
of
the
Catholic
ritual
the
miter,
the
altar,
the
doxology,
and
communion,
the
act
of
"God
eating"
were
taken
directly
from
earlier
pagan
mystery
religions."
Teabing
groaned.
"Don't
get
a
symbologist
started
on
Christian
icons.
Nothing
in
Christianity
is
original.
The
pre
Christian
God
Mithras
called
the
Son
of
God
and
the
Light
of
the
World
was
born
on
December
25,
died,
was
buried
in
a
rock
tomb,
and
then
resurrected
in
three
days.
By
the
way,
December
25
is
also
the
birthday
of
Osiris,
Adonis,
and
Dionysus.
The
newborn
Krishna
was
presented
with
gold,
frankincense,
and
myrrh.
Even
Christianity's
weekly
holy
day
was
stolen
from
the
pagans."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"Originally,"
Langdon
said,
"Christianity
honored
the
Jewish
Sabbath
of
Saturday,
but
Constantine
shifted
it
to
coincide
with
the
pagan's
veneration
day
of
the
sun."
He
paused,
grinning.
"To
this
day,
most
churchgoers
attend
services
on
Sunday
morning
with
no
idea
that
they
are
there
on
account
of
the
pagan
sun
god's
weekly
tribute
Sunday."
Sophie's
head
was
spinning.
"And
all
of
this
relates
to
the
Grail?"
"Indeed,"
Teabing
said.
"Stay
with
me.
During
this
fusion
of
religions,
Constantine
needed
to
strengthen
the
new
Christian
tradition,
and
held
a
famous
ecumenical
gathering
known
as
the
Council
of
Nicaea."
Sophie
had
heard
of
it
only
insofar
as
its
being
the
birthplace
of
the
Nicene
Creed.
"At
this
gathering,"
Teabing
said,
"many
aspects
of
Christianity
were
debated
and
voted
upon
the
date
of
Easter,
the
role
of
the
bishops,
the
administration
of
sacraments,
and,
of
course,
the
divinity
of
Jesus."
"I
don't
follow.
His
divinity?"
"My
dear,"
Teabing
declared,
"until
that
moment
in
history,
Jesus
was
viewed
by
His
followers
as
a
mortal
prophet
a
great
and
powerful
man,
but
a
man
nonetheless.
A
mortal."
"Not
the
Son
of
God?"
"Right,"
Teabing
said.
"Jesus'
establishment
as
'the
Son
of
God'
was
officially
proposed
and
voted
on
by
the
Council
of
Nicaea.
"Hold
on.
You're
saying
Jesus'
divinity
was
the
result
of
a
vote?"
"A
relatively
close
vote
at
that,"
Teabing
added.
"Nonetheless,
establishing
Christ's
divinity
was
critical
to
the
further
unification
of
the
Roman
empire
and
to
the
new
Vatican
power
base.
By
officially
endorsing
Jesus
as
the
Son
of
God,
Constantine
turned
Jesus
into
a
deity
who
existed
beyond
the
scope
of
the
human
world,
an
entity
whose
power
was
unchallengeable.
This
not
only
precluded
further
pagan
challenges
to
Christianity,
but
now
the
followers
of
Christ
were
able
to
redeem
themselves
only
via
the
established
sacred
channel
the
Roman
Catholic
Church.
Sophie
glanced
at
Langdon,
and
he
gave
her
a
soft
nod
of
concurrence.
"It
was
all
about
power,"
Teabing
continued.
"Christ
as
Messiah
was
critical
to
the
functioning
of
Church
and
state.
Many
scholars
claim
that
the
early
Church
literally
stole
Jesus
from
His
original
followers,
hijacking
His
human
message,
shrouding
it
in
an
impenetrable
cloak
of
divinity,
and
using
it
to
expand
their
own
power.
I've
written
several
books
on
the
topic."
"And
I
assume
devout
Christians
send
you
hate
mail
on
a
daily
basis?"
"Why
would
they?"
Teabing
countered.
"The
vast
majority
of
educated
Christians
know
the
history
of
their
faith.
Jesus
was
indeed
a
great
and
powerful
man.
Constantine's
underhanded
political
maneuvers
don't
diminish
the
majesty
of
Christ's
life.
Nobody
is
saying
Christ
was
a
fraud,
or
denying
that
He
walked
the
earth
and
inspired
millions
to
better
lives.
All
we
are
saying
is
that
Constantine
took
advantage
of
Christ's
substantial
influence
and
importance.
And
in
doing
so,
he
shaped
the
face
of
Christianity
as
we
know
it
today."
Sophie
glanced
at
the
art
book
before
her,
eager
to
move
on
and
see
the
Da
Vinci
painting
of
the
Holy
Grail.
"The
twist
is
this,"
Teabing
said,
talking
faster
now.
"Because
Constantine
upgraded
Jesus'
status
almost
four
centuries
after
Jesus'
death,
thousands
of
documents
already
existed
chronicling
His
life
as
a
mortal
man.
To
rewrite
the
history
books,
Constantine
knew
he
would
need
a
bold
stroke.
From
this
sprang
the
most
profound
moment
in
Christian
history."
Teabing
paused,
eyeing
Sophie.
"Constantine
commissioned
and
financed
a
new
Bible,
which
omitted
those
gospels
that
spoke
of
Christ's
human
traits
and
embellished
those
gospels
that
made
Him
godlike.
The
earlier
gospels
were
outlawed,
gathered
up,
and
burned."
"An
interesting
note,"
Langdon
added.
"Anyone
who
chose
the
forbidden
gospels
over
Constantine's
version
was
deemed
a
heretic.
The
word
heretic
derives
from
that
moment
in
history.
The
Latin
word
haereticus
means
'choice.'
Those
who
'chose'
the
original
history
of
Christ
were
the
world's
first
heretics.
"Fortunately
for
historians,"
Teabing
said,
"some
of
the
gospels
that
Constantine
attempted
to
eradicate
managed
to
survive.
The
Dead
Sea
Scrolls
were
found
in
the
1950s
hidden
in
a
cave
near
Qumran
in
the
Judean
desert.
And,
of
course,
the
Coptic
Scrolls
in
1945
at
Nag
Hammadi.
In
addition
to
telling
the
true
Grail
story,
these
documents
speak
of
Christ's
ministry
in
very
human
terms.
Of
course,
the
Vatican,
in
keeping
with
their
tradition
of
misinformation,
tried
very
hard
to
suppress
the
release
of
these
scrolls.
And
why
wouldn't
they?
The
scrolls
highlight
glaring
historical
discrepancies
and
fabrications,
clearly
confirming
that
the
modern
Bible
was
compiled
and
edited
by
men
who
possessed
a
political
agenda
to
promote
the
divinity
of
the
man
Jesus
Christ
and
use
His
influence
to
solidify
their
own
power
base."
"And
yet,"
Langdon
countered,
"it's
important
to
remember
that
the
modern
Church's
desire
to
suppress
these
documents
comes
from
a
sincere
belief
in
their
established
view
of
Christ.
The
Vatican
is
made
up
of
deeply
pious
men
who
truly
believe
these
contrary
documents
could
only
be
false
testimony.
Teabing
chuckled
as
he
