Embedded
in
the
gray
granite
floor,
a
thin
polished
strip
of
brass
glistened
in
the
stone
a
golden
line
slanting
across
the
church's
floor.
The
line
bore
graduated
markings,
like
a
ruler.
It
was
a
gnomon,
Silas
had
been
told,
a
pagan
astronomical
device
like
a
sundial.
Tourists,
scientists,
historians,
and
pagans
from
around
the
world
came
to
Saint
Sulpice
to
gaze
upon
this
famous
line.
The
Rose
Line.
Slowly,
Silas
let
his
eyes
trace
the
path
of
the
brass
strip
as
it
made
its
way
across
the
floor
from
his
right
to
left,
slanting
in
front
of
him
at
an
awkward
angle,
entirely
at
odds
with
the
symmetry
of
the
church.
Slicing
across
the
main
altar
itself,
the
line
looked
to
Silas
like
a
slash
wound
across
a
beautiful
face.
The
strip
cleaved
the
communion
rail
in
two
and
then
crossed
the
entire
width
of
the
church,
finally
reaching
the
corner
of
the
north
transept,
where
it
arrived
at
the
base
of
a
most
unexpected
structure.
A
colossal
Egyptian
obelisk.
Here,
the
glistening
Rose
Line
took
a
ninety
degree
vertical
turn
and
continued
directly
up
the
face
of
the
obelisk
itself,
ascending
thirty
three
feet
to
the
very
tip
of
the
pyramidical
apex,
where
it
finally
ceased.
The
Rose
Line,
Silas
thought.
The
brotherhood
hid
the
keystone
at
the
Rose
Line.
Earlier
tonight,
when
Silas
told
the
Teacher
that
the
Priory
keystone
was
hidden
inside
Saint
Sulpice,
the
Teacher
had
sounded
doubtful.
But
when
Silas
added
that
the
brothers
had
all
given
him
a
precise
location,
with
relation
to
a
brass
line
running
through
Saint
Sulpice,
the
Teacher
had
gasped
with
revelation.
"You
speak
of
the
Rose
Line!"
The
Teacher
quickly
told
Silas
of
Saint
Sulpice's
famed
architectural
oddity
a
strip
of
brass
that
segmented
the
sanctuary
on
a
perfect
north
south
axis.
It
was
an
ancient
sundial
of
sorts,
a
vestige
of
the
pagan
temple
that
had
once
stood
on
this
very
spot.
The
sun's
rays,
shining
through
the
oculus
on
the
south
wall,
moved
farther
down
the
line
every
day,
indicating
the
passage
of
time,
from
solstice
to
solstice.
The
north
south
stripe
had
been
known
as
the
Rose
Line.
For
centuries,
the
symbol
of
the
Rose
had
been
associated
with
maps
and
guiding
souls
in
the
proper
direction.
The
Compass
Rose
drawn
on
almost
every
map
indicated
North,
East,
South,
and
West.
Originally
known
as
the
Wind
Rose,
it
denoted
the
directions
of
the
thirty
two
winds,
blowing
from
the
directions
of
eight
major
winds,
eight
half
winds,
and
sixteen
quarter
winds.
When
diagrammed
inside
a
circle,
these
thirty
two
points
of
the
compass
perfectly
resembled
a
traditional
thirty
two
petal
rose
bloom.
To
this
day,
the
fundamental
navigational
tool
was
still
known
as
a
Compass
Rose,
its
northernmost
direction
still
marked
by
an
arrowhead
or,
more
commonly,
the
symbol
of
the
fleur
de
lis.
On
a
globe,
a
Rose
Line
also
called
a
meridian
or
longitude
was
any
imaginary
line
drawn
from
the
North
Pole
to
the
South
Pole.
There
were,
of
course,
an
infinite
number
of
Rose
Lines
because
every
point
on
the
globe
could
have
a
longitude
drawn
through
it
connecting
north
and
south
poles.
The
question
for
early
navigators
was
which
of
these
lines
would
be
called
the
Rose
Line
the
zero
longitude
the
line
from
which
all
other
longitudes
on
earth
would
be
measured.
Today
that
line
was
in
Greenwich,
England.
But
it
had
not
always
been.
Long
before
the
establishment
of
Greenwich
as
the
prime
meridian,
the
zero
longitude
of
the
entire
world
had
passed
directly
through
Paris,
and
through
the
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice.
The
brass
marker
in
Saint
Sulpice
was
a
memorial
to
the
world's
first
prime
meridian,
and
although
Greenwich
had
stripped
Paris
of
the
honor
in
1888,
the
original
Rose
Line
was
still
visible
today.
"And
so
the
legend
is
true,"
the
Teacher
had
told
Silas.
"The
Priory
keystone
has
been
said
to
lie
'beneath
the
Sign
of
the
Rose.'
Now,
still
on
his
knees
in
a
pew,
Silas
glanced
around
the
church
and
listened
to
make
sure
no
one
was
there.
For
a
moment,
he
thought
he
heard
a
rustling
in
the
choir
balcony.
He
turned
and
gazed
up
for
several
seconds.
Nothing.
am
alone.
Standing
now,
he
faced
the
altar
and
genuflected
three
times.
Then
he
turned
left
and
followed
the
brass
line
due
north
toward
the
obelisk.
At
that
moment,
at
Leonardo
da
Vinci
International
Airport
in
Rome,
the
jolt
of
tires
hitting
the
runway
startled
Bishop
Aringarosa
from
his
slumber.
drifted
off,
he
thought,
impressed
he
was
relaxed
enough
to
sleep.
"Benvenuto
a
Roma,
"
the
intercom
announced.
Sitting
up,
Aringarosa
straightened
his
black
cassock
and
allowed
himself
a
rare
smile.
This
was
one
trip
he
had
been
happy
to
make.
have
been
on
the
defensive
for
too
long.
Tonight,
however,
the
rules
had
changed.
Only
five
months
ago,
Aringarosa
had
feared
for
the
future
of
the
Faith.
Now,
as
if
by
the
will
of
God,
the
solution
had
presented
itself.
Divine
intervention.
If
all
went
as
planned
tonight
in
Paris,
Aringarosa
would
soon
be
in
possession
of
something
that
would
make
him
the
most
powerful
man
in
Christendom.
Sophie
arrived
breathless
outside
the
large
wooden
doors
of
the
Salle
des
Etats
the
room
that
housed
the
Mona
Lisa.
Before
entering,
she
gazed
reluctantly
farther
down
the
hall,
twenty
yards
or
so,
to
the
spot
where
her
grandfather's
body
still
lay
under
the
spotlight.
The
remorse
that
gripped
her
was
powerful
and
sudden,
a
deep
sadness
laced
with
guilt.
The
man
had
reached
out
to
her
so
many
times
over
the
past
ten
years,
and
yet
Sophie
had
remained
immovable
leaving
his
letters
and
packages
unopened
in
a
bottom
drawer
and
denying
his
efforts
to
see
her.
He
lied
to
me!
Kept
appalling
secrets!
What
was
I
supposed
to
do
?
And
so
she
had
blocked
him
out.
Completely.
Now
her
grandfather
was
dead,
and
he
was
talking
to
her
from
the
