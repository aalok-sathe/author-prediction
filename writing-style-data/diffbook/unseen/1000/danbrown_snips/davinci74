and
so
the
sacred
feminine
was
demonized
and
called
unclean.
It
was
man,
not
God,
who
created
the
concept
of
'original
sin,'
whereby
Eve
tasted
of
the
apple
and
caused
the
downfall
of
the
human
race.
Woman,
once
the
sacred
giver
of
life,
was
now
the
enemy."
"I
should
add,"
Teabing
chimed,
"that
this
concept
of
woman
as
life
bringer
was
the
foundation
of
ancient
religion.
Childbirth
was
mystical
and
powerful.
Sadly,
Christian
philosophy
decided
to
embezzle
the
female's
creative
power
by
ignoring
biological
truth
and
making
man
the
Creator.
Genesis
tells
us
that
Eve
was
created
from
Adam's
rib.
Woman
became
an
offshoot
of
man.
And
a
sinful
one
at
that.
Genesis
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
the
goddess."
"The
Grail,"
Langdon
said,
"is
symbolic
of
the
lost
goddess.
When
Christianity
came
along,
the
old
pagan
religions
did
not
die
easily.
Legends
of
chivalric
quests
for
the
lost
Grail
were
in
fact
stories
of
forbidden
quests
to
find
the
lost
sacred
feminine.
Knights
who
claimed
to
be
"searching
for
the
chalice"
were
speaking
in
code
as
a
way
to
protect
themselves
from
a
Church
that
had
subjugated
women,
banished
the
Goddess,
burned
nonbelievers,
and
forbidden
the
pagan
reverence
for
the
sacred
feminine."
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"I'm
sorry,
when
you
said
the
Holy
Grail
was
a
person,
I
thought
you
meant
it
was
an
actual
person."
"It
is,"
Langdon
said.
"And
not
just
any
person,"
Teabing
blurted,
clambering
excitedly
to
his
feet.
"A
woman
who
carried
with
her
a
secret
so
powerful
that,
if
revealed,
it
threatened
to
devastate
the
very
foundation
of
Christianity!"
Sophie
looked
overwhelmed.
"Is
this
woman
well
known
in
history?"
"Quite."
Teabing
collected
his
crutches
and
motioned
down
the
hall.
"And
if
we
adjourn
to
the
study,
my
friends,
it
would
be
my
honor
to
show
you
Da
Vinci's
painting
of
her."
Two
rooms
away,
in
the
kitchen,
manservant
Remy
Legaludec
stood
in
silence
before
a
television.
The
news
station
was
broadcasting
photos
of
a
man
and
woman
the
same
two
individuals
to
whom
Remy
had
just
served
tea.
Standing
at
the
roadblock
outside
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich,
Lieutenant
Collet
wondered
what
was
taking
Fache
so
long
to
come
up
with
the
search
warrant.
The
bankers
were
obviously
hiding
something.
They
claimed
Langdon
and
Neveu
had
arrived
earlier
and
were
turned
away
from
the
bank
because
they
did
not
have
proper
account
identification.
So
why
won't
they
let
us
inside
for
a
look?
Finally,
Collet's
cellular
phone
rang.
It
was
the
command
post
at
the
Louvre.
"Do
we
have
a
search
warrant
yet?"
Collet
demanded.
"Forget
about
the
bank,
Lieutenant,"
the
agent
told
him.
"We
just
got
a
tip.
We
have
the
exact
location
where
Langdon
and
Neveu
are
hiding."
Collet
sat
down
hard
on
the
hood
of
his
car.
"You're
kidding."
"I
have
an
address
in
the
suburbs.
Somewhere
near
Versailles."
"Does
Captain
Fache
know?"
"Not
yet.
He's
busy
on
an
important
call."
"I'm
on
my
way.
Have
him
call
as
soon
as
he's
free."
Collet
took
down
the
address
and
jumped
in
his
car.
As
he
peeled
away
from
the
bank,
Collet
realized
he
had
forgotten
to
ask
who
had
tipped
DCPJ
off
to
Langdon's
location.
Not
that
it
mattered.
Collet
had
been
blessed
with
a
chance
to
redeem
his
skepticism
and
earlier
blunders.
He
was
about
to
make
the
most
high
profile
arrest
of
his
career.
Collet
radioed
the
five
cars
accompanying
him.
"No
sirens,
men.
Langdon
can't
know
we're
coming."
Forty
kilometers
away,
a
black
Audi
pulled
off
a
rural
road
and
parked
in
the
shadows
on
the
edge
of
a
field.
Silas
got
out
and
peered
through
the
rungs
of
the
wrought
iron
fence
that
encircled
the
vast
compound
before
him.
He
gazed
up
the
long
moonlit
slope
to
the
chateau
in
the
distance.
The
downstairs
lights
were
all
ablaze.
Odd
for
this
hour,
Silas
thought,
smiling.
The
information
the
Teacher
had
given
him
was
obviously
accurate.
will
not
leave
this
house
without
the
keystone,
he
vowed.
will
not
fail
the
bishop
and
the
Teacher.
Checking
the
thirteen
round
clip
in
his
Heckler
Koch,
Silas
pushed
it
through
the
bars
and
let
it
fall
onto
the
mossy
ground
inside
the
compound.
Then,
gripping
the
top
of
the
fence,
he
heaved
himself
up
and
over,
dropping
to
the
ground
on
the
other
side.
Ignoring
the
slash
of
pain
from
his
cilice,
Silas
retrieved
his
gun
and
began
the
long
trek
up
the
grassy
slope.
Teabing's
"study"
was
like
no
study
Sophie
had
ever
seen.
Six
or
seven
times
larger
than
even
the
most
luxurious
of
office
spaces,
the
knight's
cabinet
de
travail
resembled
an
ungainly
hybrid
of
science
laboratory,
archival
library,
and
indoor
flea
market.
Lit
by
three
overhead
chandeliers,
the
boundless
tile
floor
was
dotted
with
clustered
islands
of
worktables
buried
beneath
books,
artwork,
artifacts,
and
a
surprising
amount
of
electronic
gear
computers,
projectors,
microscopes,
copy
machines,
and
flatbed
scanners.
"I
converted
the
ballroom,"
Teabing
said,
looking
sheepish
as
he
shuffled
into
the
room.
"I
have
little
occasion
to
dance.
Sophie
felt
as
if
the
entire
night
had
become
some
kind
of
twilight
zone
where
nothing
was
as
she
expected.
"This
is
all
for
your
work?"
"Learning
the
truth
has
become
my
life's
love,"
Teabing
said.
"And
the
Sangreal
is
my
favorite
mistress."
The
Holy
Grail
is
a
woman,
Sophie
thought,
her
mind
a
collage
of
interrelated
ideas
that
seemed
to
make
no
sense.
"You
said
you
have
a
picture
of
this
woman
who
you
claim
is
the
Holy
Grail."
"Yes,
but
it
is
not
I
who
claim
she
is
the
Grail.
Christ
Himself
made
that
claim."
"Which
one
is
the
painting?"
Sophie
asked,
scanning
the
walls.
"Hmmm"
Teabing
made
a
show
of
seeming
to
have
forgotten.
"The
Holy
Grail.
The
Sangreal.
The
Chalice."
He
wheeled
suddenly
and
pointed
to
the
far
wall.
On
it
hung
an
eight
foot
long
print
of
The
Last
Supper,
the
same
exact
image
Sophie
had
just
been
looking
at.
"There
she
