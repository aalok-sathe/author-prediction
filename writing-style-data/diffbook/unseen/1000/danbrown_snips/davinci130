he
will
kill
us
both.
Even
without
looking
at
Sophie,
he
could
hear
her
heart
beseeching
him
in
silent
desperation.
Robert,
this
man
is
not
worthy
of
the
Grail.
Please
do
not
place
it
in
his
hands.
No
matter
what
the
cost.
Langdon
had
already
made
his
decision
several
minutes
ago,
while
standing
alone
at
the
window
overlooking
College
Garden.
Protect
Sophie.
Protect
the
Grail.
Langdon
had
almost
shouted
out
in
desperation.
But
I
cannot
see
how!
The
stark
moments
of
disillusionment
had
brought
with
them
a
clarity
unlike
any
he
had
ever
felt.
The
Truth
is
right
before
your
eyes,
Robert.
He
knew
not
from
where
the
epiphany
came.
The
Grail
is
not
mocking
you,
she
is
calling
out
to
a
worthy
soul.
Now,
bowing
down
like
a
subject
several
yards
in
front
of
Leigh
Teabing,
Langdon
lowered
the
cryptex
to
within
inches
of
the
stone
floor.
"Yes,
Robert,"
Teabing
whispered,
aiming
the
gun
at
him.
"Set
it
down."
Langdon's
eyes
moved
heavenward,
up
into
the
gaping
void
of
the
Chapter
House
cupola.
Crouching
lower,
Langdon
lowered
his
gaze
to
Teabing's
gun,
aimed
directly
at
him.
"I'm
sorry,
Leigh."
In
one
fluid
motion,
Langdon
leapt
up,
swinging
his
arm
skyward,
launching
the
cryptex
straight
up
toward
the
dome
above.
Leigh
Teabing
did
not
feel
his
finger
pull
the
trigger,
but
the
Medusa
discharged
with
a
thundering
crash.
Langdon's
crouched
form
was
now
vertical,
almost
airborne,
and
the
bullet
exploded
in
the
floor
near
Langdon's
feet.
Half
of
Teabing's
brain
attempted
to
adjust
his
aim
and
fire
again
in
rage,
but
the
more
powerful
half
dragged
his
eyes
upward
into
the
cupola.
The
keystone!
Time
seemed
to
freeze,
morphing
into
a
slow
motion
dream
as
Teabing's
entire
world
became
the
airborne
keystone.
He
watched
it
rise
to
the
apex
of
its
climb
hovering
for
a
moment
in
the
void
and
then
tumbling
downward,
end
over
end,
back
toward
the
stone
floor.
All
of
Teabing's
hopes
and
dreams
were
plummeting
toward
earth.
It
cannot
strike
the
floor!
I
can
reach
it!
Teabing's
body
reacted
on
instinct.
He
released
the
gun
and
heaved
himself
forward,
dropping
his
crutches
as
he
reached
out
with
his
soft,
manicured
hands.
Stretching
his
arms
and
fingers,
he
snatched
the
keystone
from
midair.
Falling
forward
with
the
keystone
victoriously
clutched
in
his
hand,
Teabing
knew
he
was
falling
too
fast.
With
nothing
to
break
his
fall,
his
outstretched
arms
hit
first,
and
the
cryptex
collided
hard
with
the
floor.
There
was
a
sickening
crunch
of
glass
within.
For
a
full
second,
Teabing
did
not
breathe.
Lying
there
outstretched
on
the
cold
floor,
staring
the
length
of
his
outstretched
arms
at
the
marble
cylinder
in
his
bare
palms,
he
implored
the
glass
vial
inside
to
hold.
Then
the
acrid
tang
of
vinegar
cut
the
air,
and
Teabing
felt
the
cool
liquid
flowing
out
through
the
dials
onto
his
palm.
Wild
panic
gripped
him.
NO!
The
vinegar
was
streaming
now,
and
Teabing
pictured
the
papyrus
dissolving
within.
Robert,
you
fool!
The
secret
is
lost!
Teabing
felt
himself
sobbing
uncontrollably.
The
Grail
is
gone.
Everything
destroyed.
Shuddering
in
disbelief
over
Langdon's
actions,
Teabing
tried
to
force
the
cylinder
apart,
longing
to
catch
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
history
before
it
dissolved
forever.
To
his
shock,
as
he
pulled
the
ends
of
the
keystone,
the
cylinder
separated.
He
gasped
and
peered
inside.
It
was
empty
except
for
shards
of
wet
glass.
No
dissolving
papyrus.
Teabing
rolled
over
and
looked
up
at
Langdon.
Sophie
stood
beside
him,
aiming
the
gun
down
at
Teabing.
Bewildered,
Teabing
looked
back
at
the
keystone
and
saw
it.
The
dials
were
no
longer
at
random.
They
spelled
a
five
letter
word:
APPLE.
"The
orb
from
which
Eve
partook,"
Langdon
said
coolly,
"incurring
the
Holy
wrath
of
God.
Original
sin.
The
symbol
of
the
fall
of
the
sacred
feminine."
Teabing
felt
the
truth
come
crashing
down
on
him
in
excruciating
austerity.
The
orb
that
ought
be
on
Newton's
tomb
could
be
none
other
than
the
Rosy
apple
that
fell
from
heaven,
struck
Newton
on
the
head,
and
inspired
his
life's
work.
His
labor's
fruit!
The
Rosy
flesh
with
a
seeded
womb!
"Robert,"
Teabing
stammered,
overwhelmed.
"You
opened
it.
Where
is
the
map?"
Without
blinking,
Langdon
reached
into
the
breast
pocket
of
his
tweed
coat
and
carefully
extracted
a
delicate
rolled
papyrus.
Only
a
few
yards
from
where
Teabing
lay,
Langdon
unrolled
the
scroll
and
looked
at
it.
After
a
long
moment,
a
knowing
smile
crossed
Langdon's
face.
He
knows!
Teabing's
heart
craved
that
knowledge.
His
life's
dream
was
right
in
front
of
him.
"Tell
me!"
Teabing
demanded.
"Please!
Oh
God,
please!
It's
not
too
late!"
As
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
thundered
down
the
hall
toward
the
Chapter
House,
Langdon
quietly
rolled
the
papyrus
and
slipped
it
back
in
his
pocket.
"No!"
Teabing
cried
out,
trying
in
vain
to
stand.
When
the
doors
burst
open,
Bezu
Fache
entered
like
a
bull
into
a
ring,
his
feral
eyes
scanning,
finding
his
target
Leigh
Teabing
helpless
on
the
floor.
Exhaling
in
relief,
Fache
holstered
his
Manurhin
sidearm
and
turned
to
Sophie.
"Agent
Neveu,
I
am
relieved
you
and
Mr.
Langdon
are
safe.
You
should
have
come
in
when
I
asked."
The
British
police
entered
on
Fache's
heels,
seizing
the
anguished
prisoner
and
placing
him
in
handcuffs.
Sophie
seemed
stunned
to
see
Fache.
"How
did
you
find
us?"
Fache
pointed
to
Teabing.
"He
made
the
mistake
of
showing
his
ID
when
he
entered
the
abbey.
The
guards
heard
a
police
broadcast
about
our
search
for
him."
"It's
in
Langdon's
pocket!"
Teabing
was
screaming
like
a
madman.
"The
map
to
the
Holy
Grail!"
As
they
hoisted
Teabing
and
carried
him
out,
he
threw
back
his
head
and
howled.
"Robert!
Tell
me
where
it's
hidden!"
As
Teabing
passed,
Langdon
looked
him
in
the
eye.
"Only
the
worthy
find
the
Grail,
Leigh.
You
taught
me
that.
The
mist
had
settled
low
on
Kensington
Gardens
as
Silas
limped
into
a
quiet
hollow
out
of
sight.
Kneeling
