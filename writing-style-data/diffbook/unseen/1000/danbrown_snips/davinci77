Magdalene
and
slicing
his
blade
like
hand
across
her
neck.
The
same
threatening
gesture
as
in
Madonna
of
the
Rocks!
"And
here
too,"
Langdon
said,
pointing
now
to
the
crowd
of
disciples
near
Peter.
"A
bit
ominous,
no?"
Sophie
squinted
and
saw
a
hand
emerging
from
the
crowd
of
disciples.
"Is
that
hand
wielding
a
dagger?"
"Yes.
Stranger
still,
if
you
count
the
arms,
you'll
see
that
this
hand
belongs
to
no
one
at
all.
It's
disembodied.
Anonymous."
Sophie
was
starting
to
feel
overwhelmed.
"I'm
sorry,
I
still
don't
understand
how
all
of
this
makes
Mary
Magdalene
the
Holy
Grail."
"Aha!"
Teabing
exclaimed
again.
"Therein
lies
the
rub!"
He
turned
once
more
to
the
table
and
pulled
out
a
large
chart,
spreading
it
out
for
her.
It
was
an
elaborate
genealogy.
"Few
people
realize
that
Mary
Magdalene,
in
addition
to
being
Christ's
right
hand,
was
a
powerful
woman
already."
Sophie
could
now
see
the
title
of
the
family
tree.
THE
TRIBE
OF
BENJAMIN
"Mary
Magdalene
is
here,"
Teabing
said,
pointing
near
the
top
of
the
genealogy.
Sophie
was
surprised.
"She
was
of
the
House
of
Benjamin?"
"Indeed,"
Teabing
said.
"Mary
Magdalene
was
of
royal
descent."
"But
I
was
under
the
impression
Magdalene
was
poor."
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"Magdalene
was
recast
as
a
whore
in
order
to
erase
evidence
of
her
powerful
family
ties."
Sophie
found
herself
again
glancing
at
Langdon,
who
again
nodded.
She
turned
back
to
Teabing.
"But
why
would
the
early
Church
care
if
Magdalene
had
royal
blood?"
The
Briton
smiled.
"My
dear
child,
it
was
not
Mary
Magdalene's
royal
blood
that
concerned
the
Church
so
much
as
it
was
her
consorting
with
Christ,
who
also
had
royal
blood.
As
you
know,
the
Book
of
Matthew
tells
us
that
Jesus
was
of
the
House
of
David.
A
descendant
of
King
Solomon
King
of
the
Jews.
By
marrying
into
the
powerful
House
of
Benjamin,
Jesus
fused
two
royal
bloodlines,
creating
a
potent
political
union
with
the
potential
of
making
a
legitimate
claim
to
the
throne
and
restoring
the
line
of
kings
as
it
was
under
Solomon."
Sophie
sensed
he
was
at
last
coming
to
his
point.
Teabing
looked
excited
now.
"The
legend
of
the
Holy
Grail
is
a
legend
about
royal
blood.
When
Grail
legend
speaks
of
'the
chalice
that
held
the
blood
of
Christ'
it
speaks,
in
fact,
of
Mary
Magdalene
the
female
womb
that
carried
Jesus'
royal
bloodline."
The
words
seemed
to
echo
across
the
ballroom
and
back
before
they
fully
registered
in
Sophie's
mind.
Mary
Magdalene
carried
the
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ?
"But
how
could
Christ
have
a
bloodline
unless?"
She
paused
and
looked
at
Langdon.
Langdon
smiled
softly.
"Unless
they
had
a
child."
Sophie
stood
transfixed.
"Behold,"
Teabing
proclaimed,
"the
greatest
cover
up
in
human
history.
Not
only
was
Jesus
Christ
married,
but
He
was
a
father.
My
dear,
Mary
Magdalene
was
the
Holy
Vessel.
She
was
the
chalice
that
bore
the
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ.
She
was
the
womb
that
bore
the
lineage,
and
the
vine
from
which
the
sacred
fruit
sprang
forth!"
Sophie
felt
the
hairs
stand
up
on
her
arms.
"But
how
could
a
secret
that
big
be
kept
quiet
all
of
these
years?"
"Heavens!"
Teabing
said.
"It
has
been
anything
but
quiet!
The
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ
is
the
source
of
the
most
enduring
legend
of
all
time
the
Holy
Grail.
Magdalene's
story
has
been
shouted
from
the
rooftops
for
centuries
in
all
kinds
of
metaphors
and
languages.
Her
story
is
everywhere
once
you
open
your
eyes."
"And
the
Sangreal
documents?"
Sophie
said.
"They
allegedly
contain
proof
that
Jesus
had
a
royal
bloodline?"
"They
do."
"So
the
entire
Holy
Grail
legend
is
all
about
royal
blood?"
"Quite
literally,"
Teabing
said.
"The
word
Sangreal
derives
from
San
Great
or
Holy
Grail.
But
in
its
most
ancient
form,
the
word
Sangreal
was
divided
in
a
different
spot."
Teabing
wrote
on
a
piece
of
scrap
paper
and
handed
it
to
her.
She
read
what
he
had
written.
Sang
Real
Instantly,
Sophie
recognized
the
translation.
Sang
Real
literally
meant
Royal
Blood.
The
male
receptionist
in
the
lobby
of
the
Opus
Dei
headquarters
on
Lexington
Avenue
in
New
York
City
was
surprised
to
hear
Bishop
Aringarosa's
voice
on
the
line.
"Good
evening,
sir."
"Have
I
had
any
messages?"
the
bishop
demanded,
sounding
unusually
anxious.
"Yes,
sir.
I'm
very
glad
you
called
in.
I
couldn't
reach
you
in
your
apartment.
You
had
an
urgent
phone
message
about
half
an
hour
ago."
"Yes?"
He
sounded
relieved
by
the
news.
"Did
the
caller
leave
a
name?"
"No,
sir,
just
a
number."
The
operator
relayed
the
number.
"Prefix
thirty
three?
That's
France,
am
I
right?"
"Yes,
sir.
Paris.
The
caller
said
it
was
critical
you
contact
him
immediately."
"Thank
you.
I
have
been
waiting
for
that
call."
Aringarosa
quickly
severed
the
connection.
As
the
receptionist
hung
up
the
receiver,
he
wondered
why
Aringarosa's
phone
connection
sounded
so
crackly.
The
bishop's
daily
schedule
showed
him
in
New
York
this
weekend,
and
yet
he
sounded
a
world
away.
The
receptionist
shrugged
it
off.
Bishop
Aringarosa
had
been
acting
very
strangely
the
last
few
months.
My
cellular
phone
must
not
have
been
receiving,
Aringarosa
thought
as
the
Fiat
approached
the
exit
for
Rome's
Ciampino
Charter
Airport.
The
Teacher
was
trying
to
reach
me.
Despite
Aringarosa's
concern
at
having
missed
the
call,
he
felt
encouraged
that
the
Teacher
felt
confident
enough
to
call
Opus
Dei
headquarters
directly.
Things
must
have
gone
well
in
Paris
tonight.
As
Aringarosa
began
dialing
the
number,
he
felt
excited
to
know
he
would
soon
be
in
Paris.
I'll
be
on
the
ground
before
dawn.
Aringarosa
had
a
chartered
turbo
prop
awaiting
him
here
for
the
short
flight
to
France.
Commercial
carriers
were
not
an
option
at
this
hour,
especially
considering
the
contents
of
his
briefcase.
The
line
began
to
ring.
A
female
voice
answered.
"Direction
Centrale
Police
Judidaire.
Aringarosa
felt
himself
hesitate.
This
was
unexpected.
"Ah,
yes
I
was
asked
to
call
this
number?"
"Qui
