didn't
slow.
The
agent
gunned
the
sedan
across
the
junction
and
sped
onto
a
wooded
section
of
Rue
Castiglione,
which
served
as
the
northern
entrance
to
the
famed
Tuileries
Gardens
Paris's
own
version
of
Central
Park.
Most
tourists
mistranslated
Jardins
des
Tuileries
as
relating
to
the
thousands
of
tulips
that
bloomed
here,
but
Tuileries
was
actually
a
literal
reference
to
something
far
less
romantic.
This
park
had
once
been
an
enormous,
polluted
excavation
pit
from
which
Parisian
contractors
mined
clay
to
manufacture
the
city's
famous
red
roofing
tiles
or
tuiles.
As
they
entered
the
deserted
park,
the
agent
reached
under
the
dash
and
turned
off
the
blaring
siren.
Langdon
exhaled,
savoring
the
sudden
quiet.
Outside
the
car,
the
pale
wash
of
halogen
headlights
skimmed
over
the
crushed
gravel
parkway,
the
rugged
whir
of
the
tires
intoning
a
hypnotic
rhythm.
Langdon
had
always
considered
the
Tuileries
to
be
sacred
ground.
These
were
the
gardens
in
which
Claude
Monet
had
experimented
with
form
and
color,
and
literally
inspired
the
birth
of
the
Impressionist
movement.
Tonight,
however,
this
place
held
a
strange
aura
of
foreboding.
The
Citroen
swerved
left
now,
angling
west
down
the
park's
central
boulevard.
Curling
around
a
circular
pond,
the
driver
cut
across
a
desolate
avenue
out
into
a
wide
quadrangle
beyond.
Langdon
could
now
see
the
end
of
the
Tuileries
Gardens,
marked
by
a
giant
stone
archway.
Arc
du
Carrousel.
Despite
the
orgiastic
rituals
once
held
at
the
Arc
du
Carrousel,
art
aficionados
revered
this
place
for
another
reason
entirely.
From
the
esplanade
at
the
end
of
the
Tuileries,
four
of
the
finest
art
museums
in
the
world
could
be
seen
one
at
each
point
of
the
compass.
Out
the
right
hand
window,
south
across
the
Seine
and
Quai
Voltaire,
Langdon
could
see
the
dramatically
lit
facade
of
the
old
train
station
now
the
esteemed
Musee
d'Orsay.
Glancing
left,
he
could
make
out
the
top
of
the
ultramodern
Pompidou
Center,
which
housed
the
Museum
of
Modern
Art.
Behind
him
to
the
west,
Langdon
knew
the
ancient
obelisk
of
Ramses
rose
above
the
trees,
marking
the
Musee
du
Jeu
de
Paume.
But
it
was
straight
ahead,
to
the
east,
through
the
archway,
that
Langdon
could
now
see
the
monolithic
Renaissance
palace
that
had
become
the
most
famous
art
museum
in
the
world.
Musee
du
Louvre.
Langdon
felt
a
familiar
tinge
of
wonder
as
his
eyes
made
a
futile
attempt
to
absorb
the
entire
mass
of
the
edifice.
Across
a
staggeringly
expansive
plaza,
the
imposing
facade
of
the
Louvre
rose
like
a
citadel
against
the
Paris
sky.
Shaped
like
an
enormous
horseshoe,
the
Louvre
was
the
longest
building
in
Europe,
stretching
farther
than
three
Eiffel
Towers
laid
end
to
end.
Not
even
the
million
square
feet
of
open
plaza
between
the
museum
wings
could
challenge
the
majesty
of
the
facade's
breadth.
Langdon
had
once
walked
the
Louvre's
entire
perimeter,
an
astonishing
three
mile
journey.
Despite
the
estimated
five
days
it
would
take
a
visitor
to
properly
appreciate
the
65,300
pieces
of
art
in
this
building,
most
tourists
chose
an
abbreviated
experience
Langdon
referred
to
as
"Louvre
Lite"
a
full
sprint
through
the
museum
to
see
the
three
most
famous
objects:
the
Mona
Lisa,
Venus
de
Milo,
and
Winged
Victory.
Art
Buchwald
had
once
boasted
he'd
seen
all
three
masterpieces
in
five
minutes
and
fifty
six
seconds.
The
driver
pulled
out
a
handheld
walkie
talkie
and
spoke
in
rapid
fire
French.
"Monsieur
Langdon
est
arrive.
Deux
minutes.
An
indecipherable
confirmation
came
crackling
back.
The
agent
stowed
the
device,
turning
now
to
Langdon.
"You
will
meet
the
capitaine
at
the
main
entrance."
The
driver
ignored
the
signs
prohibiting
auto
traffic
on
the
plaza,
revved
the
engine,
and
gunned
the
Citroen
up
over
the
curb.
The
Louvre's
main
entrance
was
visible
now,
rising
boldly
in
the
distance,
encircled
by
seven
triangular
pools
from
which
spouted
illuminated
fountains.
La
Pyramide.
The
new
entrance
to
the
Paris
Louvre
had
become
almost
as
famous
as
the
museum
itself.
The
controversial,
neomodern
glass
pyramid
designed
by
Chinese
born
American
architect
I.
M.
Pei
still
evoked
scorn
from
traditionalists
who
felt
it
destroyed
the
dignity
of
the
Renaissance
courtyard.
Goethe
had
described
architecture
as
frozen
music,
and
Pei's
critics
described
this
pyramid
as
fingernails
on
a
chalkboard.
Progressive
admirers,
though,
hailed
Pei's
seventy
one
foot
tall
transparent
pyramid
as
a
dazzling
synergy
of
ancient
structure
and
modern
method
a
symbolic
link
between
the
old
and
new
helping
usher
the
Louvre
into
the
next
millennium.
"Do
you
like
our
pyramid?"
the
agent
asked.
Langdon
frowned.
The
French,
it
seemed,
loved
to
ask
Americans
this.
It
was
a
loaded
question,
of
course.
Admitting
you
liked
the
pyramid
made
you
a
tasteless
American,
and
expressing
dislike
was
an
insult
to
the
French.
"Mitterrand
was
a
bold
man,"
Langdon
replied,
splitting
the
difference.
The
late
French
president
who
had
commissioned
the
pyramid
was
said
to
have
suffered
from
a
"Pharaoh
complex."
Singlehandedly
responsible
for
filling
Paris
with
Egyptian
obelisks,
art,
and
artifacts.
Francois
Mitterrand
had
an
affinity
for
Egyptian
culture
that
was
so
all
consuming
that
the
French
still
referred
to
him
as
the
Sphinx.
"What
is
the
captain's
name?"
Langdon
asked,
changing
topics.
"Bezu
Fache,"
the
driver
said,
approaching
the
pyramid's
main
entrance.
"We
call
him
le
Taureau.
Langdon
glanced
over
at
him,
wondering
if
every
Frenchman
had
a
mysterious
animal
epithet.
"You
call
your
captain
the
Bull?"
The
man
arched
his
eyebrows.
"Your
French
is
better
than
you
admit,
Monsieur
Langdon."
My
French
stinks,
Langdon
thought,
but
my
zodiac
iconography
is
pretty
good.
Taurus
was
always
the
bull.
Astrology
was
a
symbolic
constant
all
over
the
world.
The
agent
pulled
the
car
to
a
stop
and
pointed
between
two
fountains
to
a
large
door
in
the
side
of
the
pyramid.
"There
is
the
entrance.
Good
luck,
monsieur."
"You're
not
coming?"
"My
orders
are
to
leave
you
here.
I
have
other
business
to
attend
to."
Langdon
heaved
a
sigh
and
climbed
out.
It's
your
circus.
The
agent
revved
his
engine
and
sped
