Sophie
translated.
"No,
that's
the
literal
translation.
Clef
de
voiite
is
a
common
architectural
term.
Voiite
refers
not
to
a
bank
vault,
but
to
a
vault
in
an
archway.
Like
a
vaulted
ceiling."
"But
vaulted
ceilings
don't
have
keys."
"Actually
they
do.
Every
stone
archway
requires
a
central,
wedge
shaped
stone
at
the
top
which
locks
the
pieces
together
and
carries
all
the
weight.
This
stone
is,
in
an
architectural
sense,
the
key
to
the
vault.
In
English
we
call
it
a
keystone.
"
Langdon
watched
her
eyes
for
any
spark
of
recognition.
Sophie
shrugged,
glancing
down
at
the
cryptex.
"But
this
obviously
is
not
a
keystone."
Langdon
didn't
know
where
to
begin.
Keystones
as
a
masonry
technique
for
building
stone
archways
had
been
one
of
the
best
kept
secrets
of
the
early
Masonic
brotherhood.
The
Royal
Arch
Degree.
Architecture.
Keystones.
It
was
all
interconnected.
The
secret
knowledge
of
how
to
use
a
wedged
keystone
to
build
a
vaulted
archway
was
part
of
the
wisdom
that
had
made
the
Masons
such
wealthy
craftsmen,
and
it
was
a
secret
they
guarded
carefully.
Keystones
had
always
had
a
tradition
of
secrecy.
And
yet,
the
stone
cylinder
in
the
rosewood
box
was
obviously
something
quite
different.
The
Priory
keystone
if
this
was
indeed
what
they
were
holding
was
not
at
all
what
Langdon
had
imagined.
"The
Priory
keystone
is
not
my
specialty,"
Langdon
admitted.
"My
interest
in
the
Holy
Grail
is
primarily
symbologic,
so
I
tend
to
ignore
the
plethora
of
lore
regarding
how
to
actually
find
it."
Sophie's
eyebrows
arched.
"Find
the
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon
gave
an
uneasy
nod,
speaking
his
next
words
carefully.
"Sophie,
according
to
Priory
lore,
the
keystone
is
an
encoded
map
a
map
that
reveals
the
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail."
Sophie's
face
went
blank.
"And
you
think
this
is
it?"
Langdon
didn't
know
what
to
say.
Even
to
him
it
sounded
unbelievable,
and
yet
the
keystone
was
the
only
logical
conclusion
he
could
muster.
An
encrypted
stone,
hidden
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
The
idea
that
the
cryptex
had
been
designed
by
Leonardo
da
Vinci
former
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion
shone
as
another
tantalizing
indicator
that
this
was
indeed
the
Priory
keystone.
A
former
Grand
Master's
blueprint
brought
to
life
centuries
later
by
another
Priory
member.
The
bond
was
too
palpable
to
dismiss.
For
the
last
decade,
historians
had
been
searching
for
the
keystone
in
French
churches.
Grail
seekers,
familiar
with
the
Priory's
history
of
cryptic
double
talk,
had
concluded
la
clef
de
voute
was
a
literal
keystone
an
architectural
wedge
an
engraved,
encrypted
stone,
inserted
into
a
vaulted
archway
in
a
church.
Beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
In
architecture,
there
was
no
shortage
of
roses.
Rose
windows.
Rosette
reliefs.
And,
of
course,
an
abundance
of
cinquefoils
the
five
petaled
decorative
flowers
often
found
at
the
top
of
archways,
directly
over
the
keystone.
The
hiding
place
seemed
diabolically
simple.
The
map
to
the
Holy
Grail
was
incorporated
high
in
an
archway
of
some
forgotten
church,
mocking
the
blind
churchgoers
who
wandered
beneath
it.
"This
cryptex
can't
bo,
the
keystone,"
Sophie
argued.
"It's
not
old
enough.
I'm
certain
my
grandfather
made
this.
It
can't
be
part
of
any
ancient
Grail
legend."
"Actually,"
Langdon
replied,
feeling
a
tingle
of
excitement
ripple
through
him,
"the
keystone
is
believed
to
have
been
created
by
the
Priory
sometime
in
the
past
couple
of
decades."
Sophie's
eyes
flashed
disbelief.
"But
if
this
cryptex
reveals
the
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail,
why
would
my
grandfather
give
it
to
me
?
I
have
no
idea
how
to
open
it
or
what
to
do
with
it.
I
don't
even
know
what
the
Holy
Grail
is!"
Langdon
realized
to
his
surprise
that
she
was
right.
He
had
not
yet
had
a
chance
to
explain
to
Sophie
the
true
nature
of
the
Holy
Grail.
That
story
would
have
to
wait.
At
the
moment,
they
were
focused
on
the
keystone.
If
that
is
indeed
what
this
is.
Against
the
hum
of
the
bulletproof
wheels
beneath
them,
Langdon
quickly
explained
to
Sophie
everything
he
had
heard
about
the
keystone.
Allegedly,
for
centuries,
the
Priory's
biggest
secret
the
location
of
the
Holy
Grail
was
never
written
down.
For
security's
sake,
it
was
verbally
transferred
to
each
new
rising
senechal
at
a
clandestine
ceremony.
However,
at
some
point
during
the
last
century,
whisperings
began
to
surface
that
the
Priory
policy
had
changed.
Perhaps
it
was
on
account
of
new
electronic
eavesdropping
capabilities,
but
the
Priory
vowed
never
again
even
to
speak
the
location
of
the
sacred
hiding
place.
"But
then
how
could
they
pass
on
the
secret?"
Sophie
asked.
"That's
where
the
keystone
comes
in,"
Langdon
explained.
"When
one
of
the
top
four
members
died,
the
remaining
three
would
choose
from
the
lower
echelons
the
next
candidate
to
ascend
as
senechal.
Rather
than
telling
the
new
senechal
where
the
Grail
was
hidden,
they
gave
him
a
test
through
which
he
could
prove
he
was
worthy."
Sophie
looked
unsettled
by
this,
and
Langdon
suddenly
recalled
her
mentioning
how
her
grandfather
used
to
make
treasure
hunts
for
her
preuves
de
merite.
Admittedly,
the
keystone
was
a
similar
concept.
Then
again,
tests
like
this
were
extremely
common
in
secret
societies.
The
best
known
was
the
Masons',
wherein
members
ascended
to
higher
degrees
by
proving
they
could
keep
a
secret
and
by
performing
rituals
and
various
tests
of
merit
over
many
years.
The
tasks
became
progressively
harder
until
they
culminated
in
a
successful
candidate's
induction
as
thirty
second
degree
Mason.
"So
the
keystone
is
apreuve
de
merite,
"
Sophie
said.
"If
a
rising
Priory
senechal
can
open
it,
he
proves
himself
worthy
of
the
information
it
holds."
Langdon
nodded.
"I
forgot
you'd
had
experience
with
this
sort
of
thing."
"Not
only
with
my
grandfather.
In
cryptology,
that's
called
a
'self
authorizing
language.'
That
is,
if
you're
smart
enough
to
read
it,
you're
permitted
to
know
what
is
being
said.
Langdon
hesitated
a
moment.
"Sophie,
you
realize
that
if
this
