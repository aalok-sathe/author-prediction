is
indeed
the
keystone,
your
grandfather's
access
to
it
implies
he
was
exceptionally
powerful
within
the
Priory
of
Sion.
He
would
have
to
have
been
one
of
the
highest
four
members."
Sophie
sighed.
"He
was
powerful
in
a
secret
society.
I'm
certain
of
it.
I
can
only
assume
it
was
the
Priory.
Langdon
did
a
double
take.
"You
knew
he
was
in
a
secret
society?"
"I
saw
some
things
I
wasn't
supposed
to
see
ten
years
ago.
We
haven't
spoken
since."
She
paused.
"My
grandfather
was
not
only
a
ranking
top
member
of
the
group
I
believe
he
was
the
top
member."
Langdon
could
not
believe
what
she
had
just
said.
"Grand
Master?
But
there's
no
way
you
could
know
that!"
"I'd
rather
not
talk
about
it."
Sophie
looked
away,
her
expression
as
determined
as
it
was
pained.
Langdon
sat
in
stunned
silence.
Jacques
Sauniere?
Grand
Master?
Despite
the
astonishing
repercussions
if
it
were
true,
Langdon
had
the
eerie
sensation
it
almost
made
perfect
sense.
After
all,
previous
Priory
Grand
Masters
had
also
been
distinguished
public
figures
with
artistic
souls.
Proof
of
that
fact
had
been
uncovered
years
ago
in
Paris's
Bibliotheque
Nationale
in
papers
that
became
known
as
Les
Dossiers
Secrets.
Every
Priory
historian
and
Grail
buff
had
read
the
Dossiers.
Cataloged
under
Number
4
lm
1
249,
the
Dossiers
Secrets
had
been
authenticated
by
many
specialists
and
incontrovertibly
confirmed
what
historians
had
suspected
for
a
long
time:
Priory
Grand
Masters
included
Leonardo
da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
Sir
Isaac
Newton,
Victor
Hugo,
and,
more
recently,
Jean
Cocteau,
the
famous
Parisian
artist.
Why
not
Jacques
Sauniere
?
Langdon's
incredulity
intensified
with
the
realization
that
he
had
been
slated
to
meet
Sauniere
tonight.
The
Priory
Grand
Master
called
a
meeting
with
me.
Why?
To
make
artistic
small
talk?
It
suddenly
seemed
unlikely.
After
all,
if
Langdon's
instincts
were
correct,
the
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion
had
just
transferred
the
brotherhood's
legendary
keystone
to
his
granddaughter
and
simultaneously
commanded
her
to
find
Robert
Langdon.
Inconceivable!
Langdon's
imagination
could
conjure
no
set
of
circumstances
that
would
explain
Sauniere's
behavior.
Even
if
Sauniere
feared
his
own
death,
there
were
three
senechaux
who
also
possessed
the
secret
and
therefore
guaranteed
the
Priory's
security.
Why
would
Sauniere
take
such
an
enormous
risk
giving
his
granddaughter
the
keystone,
especially
when
the
two
of
them
didn't
get
along?
And
why
involve
Langdon
a
total
stranger?
Apiece
of
this
puzzle
is
missing,
Langdon
thought.
The
answers
were
apparently
going
to
have
to
wait.
The
sound
of
the
slowing
engine
caused
them
both
to
look
up.
Gravel
crunched
beneath
the
tires.
Why
is
he
pulling
over
already?
Langdon
wondered.
Vernet
had
told
them
he
would
take
them
well
outside
the
city
to
safety.
The
truck
decelerated
to
a
crawl
and
made
its
way
over
unexpectedly
rough
terrain.
Sophie
shot
Langdon
an
uneasy
look,
hastily
closing
the
cryptex
box
and
latching
it.
Langdon
slipped
his
jacket
back
on.
When
the
truck
came
to
a
stop,
the
engine
remained
idling
as
the
locks
on
the
rear
doors
began
to
turn.
When
the
doors
swung
open,
Langdon
was
surprised
to
see
they
were
parked
in
a
wooded
area,
well
off
the
road.
Vernet
stepped
into
view,
a
strained
look
in
his
eye.
In
his
hand,
he
held
a
pistol.
'I'm
sorry
about
this,"
he
said.
"I
really
have
no
choice.
Andre
Vernet
looked
awkward
with
a
pistol,
but
his
eyes
shone
with
a
determination
that
Langdon
sensed
would
be
unwise
to
test.
"I'm
afraid
I
must
insist,"
Vernet
said,
training
the
weapon
on
the
two
of
them
in
the
back
of
the
idling
truck.
"Set
the
box
down."
Sophie
clutched
the
box
to
her
chest.
"You
said
you
and
my
grandfather
were
friends."
"I
have
a
duty
to
protect
your
grandfather's
assets,"
Vernet
replied.
"And
that
is
exactly
what
I
am
doing.
Now
set
the
box
on
the
floor."
"My
grandfather
entrusted
this
to
me!"
Sophie
declared.
"Do
it,"
Vernet
commanded,
raising
the
gun.
Sophie
set
the
box
at
her
feet.
Langdon
watched
the
gun
barrel
swing
now
in
his
direction.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
Vernet
said,
"you
will
bring
the
box
over
to
me.
And
be
aware
that
I'm
asking
you
because
you
I
would
not
hesitate
to
shoot."
Langdon
stared
at
the
banker
in
disbelief.
"Why
are
you
doing
this?"
"Why
do
you
imagine?"
Vernet
snapped,
his
accented
English
terse
now.
"To
protect
my
client's
assets."
"We
are
your
clients
now,"
Sophie
said.
Vernet's
visage
turned
ice
cold,
an
eerie
transformation.
"Mademoiselle
Neveu,
I
don't
know
how
you
got
that
key
and
account
number
tonight,
but
it
seems
obvious
that
foul
play
was
involved.
Had
I
known
the
extent
of
your
crimes,
I
would
never
have
helped
you
leave
the
bank."
"I
told
you,"
Sophie
said,
"we
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
grandfather's
death!"
Vernet
looked
at
Langdon.
"And
yet
the
radio
claims
you
are
wanted
not
only
for
the
murder
of
Jacques
Sauniere
but
for
those
of
three
other
men
as
well?"
"What!"
Langdon
was
thunderstruck.
Three
more
murders?
The
coincidental
number
hit
him
harder
than
the
fact
that
he
was
the
prime
suspect.
It
seemed
too
unlikely
to
be
a
coincidence.
The
three
senechaux?
Langdon's
eyes
dropped
to
the
rosewood
box.
If
the
senechaux
were
murdered,
Sauniere
had
no
options.
He
had
to
transfer
the
keystone
to
someone.
"The
police
can
sort
that
out
when
I
turn
you
in,"
Vernet
said.
"I
have
gotten
my
bank
involved
too
far
already."
Sophie
glared
at
Vernet.
"You
obviously
have
no
intention
of
turning
us
in.
You
would
have
driven
us
back
to
the
bank.
And
instead
you
bring
us
out
here
and
hold
us
at
gunpoint?"
"Your
grandfather
hired
me
for
one
reason
to
keep
his
possessions
both
safe
and
private.
Whatever
this
box
contains,
I
have
no
intention
of
letting
it
become
a
piece
of
cataloged
evidence
in
a
police
investigation.
Mr.
Langdon,
bring
me
the
box.
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"Don't
do
it."
A
gunshot
roared,
and
a
bullet
