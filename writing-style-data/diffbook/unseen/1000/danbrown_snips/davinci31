declared,
her
voice
hollow
in
the
stairwell.
"To
the
Mona
Lisa?"
Langdon
recoiled.
"Now?"
Sophie
considered
the
risk.
"I'm
not
a
murder
suspect.
I'll
take
my
chances.
I
need
to
understand
what
my
grandfather
was
trying
to
tell
me."
"What
about
the
embassy?"
Sophie
felt
guilty
turning
Langdon
into
a
fugitive
only
to
abandon
him,
but
she
saw
no
other
option.
She
pointed
down
the
stairs
to
a
metal
door.
"Go
through
that
door,
and
follow
the
illuminated
exit
signs.
My
grandfather
used
to
bring
me
down
here.
The
signs
will
lead
you
to
a
security
turnstile.
It's
monodirectional
and
opens
out."
She
handed
Langdon
her
car
keys.
"Mine
is
the
red
SmartCar
in
the
employee
lot.
Directly
outside
this
bulkhead.
Do
you
know
how
to
get
to
the
embassy?"
Langdon
nodded,
eyeing
the
keys
in
his
hand.
"Listen,"
Sophie
said,
her
voice
softening.
"I
think
my
grandfather
may
have
left
me
a
message
at
the
Mona
Lisa
some
kind
of
clue
as
to
who
killed
him.
Or
why
I'm
in
danger."
Or
what
happened
to
my
family.
"I
have
to
go
see."
"But
if
he
wanted
to
tell
you
why
you
were
in
danger,
why
wouldn't
he
simply
write
it
on
the
floor
where
he
died?
Why
this
complicated
word
game?"
"Whatever
my
grandfather
was
trying
to
tell
me,
I
don't
think
he
wanted
anyone
else
to
hear
it.
Not
even
the
police."
Clearly,
her
grandfather
had
done
everything
in
his
power
to
send
a
confidential
transmission
directly
to
her.
He
had
written
it
in
code,
included
her
secret
initials,
and
told
her
to
find
Robert
Langdon
a
wise
command,
considering
the
American
symbologist
had
deciphered
his
code.
"As
strange
as
it
may
sound,"
Sophie
said,
"I
think
he
wants
me
to
get
to
the
Mona
Lisa
before
anyone
else
does."
"I'llcome."
"No!
We
don't
know
how
long
the
Grand
Gallery
will
stay
empty.
You
have
to
go."
Langdon
seemed
hesitant,
as
if
his
own
academic
curiosity
were
threatening
to
override
sound
judgment
and
drag
him
back
into
Fache's
hands.
"Go.
Now."
Sophie
gave
him
a
grateful
smile.
"I'll
see
you
at
the
embassy,
Mr.
Langdon."
Langdon
looked
displeased.
"I'll
meet
you
there
on
one
condition,"
he
replied,
his
voice
stern.
She
paused,
startled.
"What's
that?"
"That
you
stop
calling
me
Mr.
Langdon."
Sophie
detected
the
faint
hint
of
a
lopsided
grin
growing
across
Langdon's
face,
and
she
felt
herself
smile
back.
"Good
luck,
Robert."
When
Langdon
reached
the
landing
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs,
the
unmistakable
smell
of
linseed
oil
and
plaster
dust
assaulted
his
nostrils.
Ahead,
an
illuminated
SORTIEEXIT
displayed
an
arrow
pointing
down
a
long
corridor.
Langdon
stepped
into
the
hallway.
To
the
right
gaped
a
murky
restoration
studio
out
of
which
peered
an
army
of
statues
in
various
states
of
repair.
To
the
left,
Langdon
saw
a
suite
of
studios
that
resembled
Harvard
art
classrooms
rows
of
easels,
paintings,
palettes,
framing
tools
an
art
assembly
line.
As
he
moved
down
the
hallway,
Langdon
wondered
if
at
any
moment
he
might
awake
with
a
start
in
his
bed
in
Cambridge.
The
entire
evening
had
felt
like
a
bizarre
dream.
I'm
about
to
dash
out
of
the
Louvre
a
fugitive.
Sauniere's
clever
anagrammatic
message
was
still
on
his
mind,
and
Langdon
wondered
what
Sophie
would
find
at
the
Mona
Lisa
if
anything.
She
had
seemed
certain
her
grandfather
meant
for
her
to
visit
the
famous
painting
one
more
time.
As
plausible
an
interpretation
as
this
seemed,
Langdon
felt
haunted
now
by
a
troubling
paradox.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Sauniere
had
written
Langdon's
name
on
the
floor,
commanding
Sophie
to
find
him.
But
why?
Merely
so
Langdon
could
help
her
break
an
anagram?
It
seemed
quite
unlikely.
After
all,
Sauniere
had
no
reason
to
think
Langdon
was
especially
skilled
at
anagrams.
We've
never
even
met.
More
important,
Sophie
had
stated
flat
out
that
she
should
have
broken
the
anagram
on
her
own.
It
had
been
Sophie
who
spotted
the
Fibonacci
sequence,
and,
no
doubt,
Sophie
who,
if
given
a
little
more
time,
would
have
deciphered
the
message
with
no
help
from
Langdon.
Sophie
was
supposed
to
break
that
anagram
on
her
own.
Langdon
was
suddenly
feeling
more
certain
about
this,
and
yet
the
conclusion
left
an
obvious
gaping
lapse
in
the
logic
of
Sauniere's
actions.
Why
me?
Langdon
wondered,
heading
down
the
hall.
Why
was
Sauniere's
dying
wish
that
his
estranged
granddaughter
find
me?
What
is
it
that
Sauniere
thinks
I
know?
With
an
unexpected
jolt,
Langdon
stopped
short.
Eyes
wide,
he
dug
in
his
pocket
and
yanked
out
the
computer
printout.
He
stared
at
the
last
line
of
Sauniere's
message.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
He
fixated
on
two
letters.
P.S.
In
that
instant,
Langdon
felt
Sauniere's
puzzling
mix
of
symbolism
fall
into
stark
focus.
Like
a
peal
of
thunder,
a
career's
worth
of
symbology
and
history
came
crashing
down
around
him.
Everything
Jacques
Sauniere
had
done
tonight
suddenly
made
perfect
sense.
Langdon's
thoughts
raced
as
he
tried
to
assemble
the
implications
of
what
this
all
meant.
Wheeling,
he
stared
back
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come.
Is
there
time
?
He
knew
it
didn't
matter.
Without
hesitation,
Langdon
broke
into
a
sprint
back
toward
the
stairs.
Kneeling
in
the
first
pew,
Silas
pretended
to
pray
as
he
scanned
the
layout
of
the
sanctuary.
Saint
Sulpice,
like
most
churches,
had
been
built
in
the
shape
of
a
giant
Roman
cross.
Its
long
central
section
the
nave
led
directly
to
the
main
altar,
where
it
was
transversely
intersected
by
a
shorter
section,
known
as
the
transept.
The
intersection
of
nave
and
transept
occurred
directly
beneath
the
main
cupola
and
was
considered
the
heart
of
the
church
her
most
sacred
and
mystical
point.
Not
tonight,
Silas
thought.
Saint
Sulpice
hides
her
secrets
elsewhere.
Turning
his
head
to
the
right,
he
gazed
into
the
south
transept,
toward
the
open
area
of
floor
beyond
the
end
of
the
pews,
to
the
object
his
victims
had
described.
There
it
is.
