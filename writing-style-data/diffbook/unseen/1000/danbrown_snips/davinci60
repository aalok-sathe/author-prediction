anywhere
near
the
clients.
You
need
to
go
in
and
ask
the
front
desk."
"Your
bank
is
demanding
a
search
warrant
before
we
can
enter."
Vernet
put
on
a
disgusted
look.
"Administrators.
Don't
get
me
started."
"Open
your
truck,
please."
Collet
motioned
toward
the
cargo
hold.
Vernet
stared
at
the
agent
and
forced
an
obnoxious
laugh.
"Open
the
truck?
You
think
I
have
keys?
You
think
they
trust
us?
You
should
see
the
crap
wages
I
get
paid."
The
agent's
head
tilted
to
one
side,
his
skepticism
evident.
"You're
telling
me
you
don't
have
keys
to
your
own
truck?"
Vernet
shook
his
head.
"Not
the
cargo
area.
Ignition
only.
These
trucks
get
sealed
by
overseers
on
the
loading
dock.
Then
the
truck
sits
in
dock
while
someone
drives
the
cargo
keys
to
the
drop
off.
Once
we
get
the
call
that
the
cargo
keys
are
with
the
recipient,
then
I
get
the
okay
to
drive.
Not
a
second
before.
I
never
know
what
the
hell
I'm
lugging."
"When
was
this
truck
sealed?"
"Must
have
been
hours
ago.
I'm
driving
all
the
way
up
to
St.
Thurial
tonight.
Cargo
keys
are
already
up
there."
The
agent
made
no
response,
his
eyes
probing
as
if
trying
to
read
Vernet's
mind.
A
drop
of
sweat
was
preparing
to
slide
down
Vernet's
nose.
"You
mind?"
he
said,
wiping
his
nose
with
his
sleeve
and
motioning
to
the
police
car
blocking
his
way.
"I'm
on
a
tight
schedule."
"Do
all
the
drivers
wear
Rolexes?"
the
agent
asked,
pointing
to
Vernet's
wrist.
Vernet
glanced
down
and
saw
the
glistening
band
of
his
absurdly
expensive
watch
peeking
out
from
beneath
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket.
Merde.
"This
piece
of
shit?
Bought
it
for
twenty
euro
from
a
Taiwanese
street
vendor
in
St.
Germain
des
Pres.
I'll
sell
it
to
you
for
forty."
The
agent
paused
and
finally
stepped
aside.
"No
thanks.
Have
a
safe
trip."
Vernet
did
not
breathe
again
until
the
truck
was
a
good
fifty
meters
down
the
street.
And
now
he
had
another
problem.
His
cargo.
Where
do
I
take
them?
Silas
lay
prone
on
the
canvas
mat
in
his
room,
allowing
the
lash
wounds
on
his
back
to
clot
in
the
air.
Tonight's
second
session
with
the
Discipline
had
left
him
dizzy
and
weak.
He
had
yet
to
remove
the
cilice
belt,
and
he
could
feel
the
blood
trickling
down
his
inner
thigh.
Still,
he
could
not
justify
removing
the
strap.
have
failed
the
Church.
Far
worse,
I
have
failed
the
bishop.
Tonight
was
supposed
to
be
Bishop
Aringarosa's
salvation.
Five
months
ago,
the
bishop
had
returned
from
a
meeting
at
the
Vatican
Observatory,
where
he
had
learned
something
that
left
him
deeply
changed.
Depressed
for
weeks,
Aringarosa
had
finally
shared
the
news
with
Silas.
"But
this
is
impossible!"
Silas
had
cried
out.
"I
cannot
accept
it!"
"It
is
true,"
Aringarosa
said.
"Unthinkable,
but
true.
In
only
six
months."
The
bishop's
words
terrified
Silas.
He
prayed
for
deliverance,
and
even
in
those
dark
days,
his
trust
in
God
and
The
Way
never
wavered.
It
was
only
a
month
later
that
the
clouds
parted
miraculously
and
the
light
of
possibility
shone
through.
Divine
intervention,
Aringarosa
had
called
it.
The
bishop
had
seemed
hopeful
for
the
first
time.
"Silas,"
he
whispered,
"God
has
bestowed
upon
us
an
opportunity
to
protect
The
Way.
Our
battle,
like
all
battles,
will
take
sacrifice.
Will
you
be
a
soldier
of
God?"
Silas
fell
to
his
knees
before
Bishop
Aringarosa
the
man
who
had
given
him
a
new
life
and
he
said,
"I
am
a
lamb
of
God.
Shepherd
me
as
your
heart
commands."
When
Aringarosa
described
the
opportunity
that
had
presented
itself,
Silas
knew
it
could
only
be
the
hand
of
God
at
work.
Miraculous
fate!
Aringarosa
put
Silas
in
contact
with
the
man
who
had
proposed
the
plan
a
man
who
called
himself
the
Teacher.
Although
the
Teacher
and
Silas
never
met
face
to
face,
each
time
they
spoke
by
phone,
Silas
was
awed,
both
by
the
profundity
of
the
Teacher's
faith
and
by
the
scope
of
his
power.
The
Teacher
seemed
to
be
a
man
who
knew
all,
a
man
with
eyes
and
ears
in
all
places.
How
the
Teacher
gathered
his
information,
Silas
did
not
know,
but
Aringarosa
had
placed
enormous
trust
in
the
Teacher,
and
he
had
told
Silas
to
do
the
same.
"Do
as
the
Teacher
commands
you,"
the
bishop
told
Silas.
"And
we
will
be
victorious."
Victorious.
Silas
now
gazed
at
the
bare
floor
and
feared
victory
had
eluded
them.
The
Teacher
had
been
tricked.
The
keystone
was
a
devious
dead
end.
And
with
the
deception,
all
hope
had
vanished.
Silas
wished
he
could
call
Bishop
Aringarosa
and
warn
him,
but
the
Teacher
had
removed
all
their
lines
of
direct
communication
tonight.
For
our
safety.
Finally,
overcoming
enormous
trepidation,
Silas
crawled
to
his
feet
and
found
his
robe,
which
lay
on
the
floor.
He
dug
his
cell
phone
from
the
pocket.
Hanging
his
head
in
shame,
he
dialed.
"Teacher,"
he
whispered,
"all
is
lost."
Silas
truthfully
told
the
man
how
he
had
been
tricked.
"You
lose
your
faith
too
quickly,"
the
Teacher
replied.
"I
have
just
received
news.
Most
unexpected
and
welcome.
The
secret
lives.
Jacques
Sauniere
transferred
information
before
he
died.
I
will
call
you
soon.
Our
work
tonight
is
not
yet
done."
Riding
inside
the
dimly
lit
cargo
hold
of
the
armored
truck
was
like
being
transported
inside
a
cell
for
solitary
confinement.
Langdon
fought
the
all
too
familiar
anxiety
that
haunted
him
in
confined
spaces.
Vernet
said
he
would
take
us
a
safe
distance
out
of
the
city.
Where?
How
far?
Langdon's
legs
had
gotten
stiff
from
sitting
cross
legged
on
the
metal
floor,
and
he
shifted
his
position,
wincing
to
feel
the
blood
pouring
back
into
his
lower
body.
In
his
arms,
he
still
clutched
the
bizarre
treasure
they
had
extricated
from
the
bank.
"I
think
we're
on
the
highway
now,"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
sensed
the
same
thing.
The
