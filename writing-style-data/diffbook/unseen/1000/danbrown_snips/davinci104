and
tossed
unceremoniously
into
the
Tiber
River.
But
this
poem
refers
to
a
tomb.
A
tomb
in
London.
And
there
are
few
knights
buried
in
London.
"
He
paused,
eyeing
Langdon
as
if
waiting
for
light
to
dawn.
Finally
he
huffed.
"Robert,
for
heaven's
sake!
The
church
built
in
London
by
the
Priory's
military
arm
the
Knights
Templar
themselves
!
"The
Temple
Church?"
Langdon
drew
a
startled
breath.
"It
has
a
crypt?"
"Ten
of
the
most
frightening
tombs
you
will
ever
see."
Langdon
had
never
actually
visited
the
Temple
Church,
although
he'd
come
across
numerous
references
in
his
Priory
research.
Once
the
epicenter
of
all
TemplarPriory
activities
in
the
United
Kingdom,
the
Temple
Church
had
been
so
named
in
honor
of
Solomon's
Temple,
from
which
the
Knights
Templar
had
extracted
their
own
title,
as
well
as
the
Sangreal
documents
that
gave
them
all
their
influence
in
Rome.
Tales
abounded
of
knights
performing
strange,
secretive
rituals
within
the
Temple
Church's
unusual
sanctuary.
"The
Temple
Church
is
on
Fleet
Street?"
"Actually,
it's
just
off
Fleet
Street
on
Inner
Temple
Lane."
Teabing
looked
mischievous.
"I
wanted
to
see
you
sweat
a
little
more
before
I
gave
it
away."
"Thanks."
"Neither
of
you
has
ever
been
there?"
Sophie
and
Langdon
shook
their
heads.
"I'm
not
surprised,"
Teabing
said.
"The
church
is
hidden
now
behind
much
larger
buildings.
Few
people
even
know
it's
there.
Eerie
old
place.
The
architecture
is
pagan
to
the
core."
Sophie
looked
surprised.
"Pagan?"
"Pantheonically
pagan!"
Teabing
exclaimed.
"The
church
is
round.
The
Templars
ignored
the
traditional
Christian
cruciform
layout
and
built
a
perfectly
circular
church
in
honor
of
the
sun."
His
eyebrows
did
a
devilish
dance.
"A
not
so
subtle
howdy
do
to
the
boys
in
Rome.
They
might
as
well
have
resurrected
Stonehenge
in
downtown
London."
Sophie
eyed
Teabing.
"What
about
the
rest
of
the
poem?"
The
historian's
mirthful
air
faded.
"I'm
not
sure.
It's
puzzling.
We
will
need
to
examine
each
of
the
ten
tombs
carefully.
With
luck,
one
of
them
will
have
a
conspicuously
absent
orb."
Langdon
realized
how
close
they
really
were.
If
the
missing
orb
revealed
the
password,
they
would
be
able
to
open
the
second
cryptex.
He
had
a
hard
time
imagining
what
they
might
find
inside.
Langdon
eyed
the
poem
again.
It
was
like
some
kind
of
primordial
crossword
puzzle.
A
five
letter
word
that
speaks
of
the
Grail?
On
the
plane,
they
had
already
tried
all
the
obvious
passwords
GRAIL,
GRAAL,
GREAL,
VENUS,
MARIA,
JESUS,
SARAH
but
the
cylinder
had
not
budged.
Far
too
obvious.
Apparently
there
existed
some
other
five
letter
reference
to
the
Rose's
seeded
womb.
The
fact
that
the
word
was
eluding
a
specialist
like
Leigh
Teabing
signified
to
Langdon
that
it
was
no
ordinary
Grail
reference.
"Sir
Leigh?"
Remy
called
over
his
shoulder.
He
was
watching
them
in
the
rearview
mirror
through
the
open
divider.
"You
said
Fleet
Street
is
near
Blackfriars
Bridge?"
"Yes,
take
Victoria
Embankment."
"I'm
sorry.
I'm
not
sure
where
that
is.
We
usually
go
only
to
the
hospital."
Teabing
rolled
his
eyes
at
Langdon
and
Sophie
and
grumbled,
"I
swear,
sometimes
it's
like
baby
sitting
a
child.
One
moment
please.
Help
yourself
to
a
drink
and
savory
snacks."
He
left
them,
clambering
awkwardly
toward
the
open
divider
to
talk
to
Remy.
Sophie
turned
to
Langdon
now,
her
voice
quiet.
"Robert,
nobody
knows
you
and
I
are
in
England."
Langdon
realized
she
was
right.
The
Kent
police
would
tell
Fache
the
plane
was
empty,
and
Fache
would
have
to
assume
they
were
still
in
France.
We
are
invisible.
Leigh's
little
stunt
had
just
bought
them
a
lot
of
time.
"Fache
will
not
give
up
easily,"
Sophie
said.
"He
has
too
much
riding
on
this
arrest
now."
Langdon
had
been
trying
not
to
think
about
Fache.
Sophie
had
promised
she
would
do
everything
in
her
power
to
exonerate
Langdon
once
this
was
over,
but
Langdon
was
starting
to
fear
it
might
not
matter.
Fache
could
easily
be
pan
of
this
plot.
Although
Langdon
could
not
imagine
the
Judicial
Police
tangled
up
in
the
Holy
Grail,
he
sensed
too
much
coincidence
tonight
to
disregard
Fache
as
a
possible
accomplice.
Fache
is
religions,
and
he
is
intent
on
pinning
these
murders
on
me.
Then
again,
Sophie
had
argued
that
Fache
might
simply
be
overzealous
to
make
the
arrest.
After
all,
the
evidence
against
Langdon
was
substantial.
In
addition
to
Langdon's
name
scrawled
on
the
Louvre
floor
and
in
Sauniere's
date
book,
Langdon
now
appeared
to
have
lied
about
his
manuscript
and
then
run
away.
At
Sophie
's
suggestion.
"Robert,
I'm
sorry
you're
so
deeply
involved,"
Sophie
said,
placing
her
hand
on
his
knee.
"But
I'm
very
glad
you're
here."
The
comment
sounded
more
pragmatic
than
romantic,
and
yet
Langdon
felt
an
unexpected
flicker
of
attraction
between
them.
He
gave
her
a
tired
smile.
"I'm
a
lot
more
fun
when
I've
slept."
Sophie
was
silent
for
several
seconds.
"My
grandfather
asked
me
to
trust
you.
I'm
glad
I
listened
to
him
for
once."
"Your
grandfather
didn't
even
know
me."
"Even
so,
I
can't
help
but
think
you've
done
everything
he
would
have
wanted.
You
helped
me
find
the
keystone,
explained
the
Sangreal,
told
me
about
the
ritual
in
the
basement."
She
paused.
"Somehow
I
feel
closer
to
my
grandfather
tonight
than
I
have
in
years.
I
know
he
would
be
happy
about
that."
In
the
distance,
now,
the
skyline
of
London
began
to
materialize
through
the
dawn
drizzle.
Once
dominated
by
Big
Ben
and
Tower
Bridge,
the
horizon
now
bowed
to
the
Millennium
Eye
a
colossal,
ultramodern
Ferris
wheel
that
climbed
five
hundred
feet
and
afforded
breathtaking
views
of
the
city.
Langdon
had
attempted
to
board
it
once,
but
the
"viewing
capsules"
reminded
him
of
sealed
sarcophagi,
and
he
opted
to
keep
his
feet
on
the
ground
and
enjoy
the
view
from
the
airy
banks
of
the
Thames.
Langdon
felt
a
squeeze
on
his
knee,
pulling
him
back,
and
Sophie's
green
eyes
were
on
him.
He
realized
she
had
