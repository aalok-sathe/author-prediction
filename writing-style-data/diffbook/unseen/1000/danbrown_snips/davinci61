truck,
after
an
unnerving
pause
atop
the
bank
ramp,
had
moved
on,
snaking
left
and
right
for
a
minute
or
two,
and
was
now
accelerating
to
what
felt
like
top
speed.
Beneath
them,
the
bulletproof
tires
hummed
on
smooth
pavement.
Forcing
his
attention
to
the
rosewood
box
in
his
arms,
Langdon
laid
the
precious
bundle
on
the
floor,
unwrapped
his
jacket,
and
extracted
the
box,
pulling
it
toward
him.
Sophie
shifted
her
position
so
they
were
sitting
side
by
side.
Langdon
suddenly
felt
like
they
were
two
kids
huddled
over
a
Christmas
present.
In
contrast
to
the
warm
colors
of
the
rosewood
box,
the
inlaid
rose
had
been
crafted
of
a
pale
wood,
probably
ash,
which
shone
clearly
in
the
dim
light.
The
Rose.
Entire
armies
and
religions
had
been
built
on
this
symbol,
as
had
secret
societies.
The
Rosicrucians.
The
Knights
of
the
Rosy
Cross.
"Go
ahead,"
Sophie
said.
"Open
it."
Langdon
took
a
deep
breath.
Reaching
for
the
lid,
he
stole
one
more
admiring
glance
at
the
intricate
woodwork
and
then,
unhooking
the
clasp,
he
opened
the
lid,
revealing
the
object
within.
Langdon
had
harbored
several
fantasies
about
what
they
might
find
inside
this
box,
but
clearly
he
had
been
wrong
on
every
account.
Nestled
snugly
inside
the
box's
heavily
padded
interior
of
crimson
silk
lay
an
object
Langdon
could
not
even
begin
to
comprehend.
Crafted
of
polished
white
marble,
it
was
a
stone
cylinder
approximately
the
dimensions
of
a
tennis
ball
can.
More
complicated
than
a
simple
column
of
stone,
however,
the
cylinder
appeared
to
have
been
assembled
in
many
pieces.
Six
doughnutsized
disks
of
marble
had
been
stacked
and
affixed
to
one
another
within
a
delicate
brass
framework.
It
looked
like
some
kind
of
tubular,
multiwheeled
kaleidoscope.
Each
end
of
the
cylinder
was
affixed
with
an
end
cap,
also
marble,
making
it
impossible
to
see
inside.
Having
heard
liquid
within,
Langdon
assumed
the
cylinder
was
hollow.
As
mystifying
as
the
construction
of
the
cylinder
was,
however,
it
was
the
engravings
around
the
tube's
circumference
that
drew
Langdon's
primary
focus.
Each
of
the
six
disks
had
been
carefully
carved
with
the
same
unlikely
series
of
letters
the
entire
alphabet.
The
lettered
cylinder
reminded
Langdon
of
one
of
his
childhood
toys
a
rod
threaded
with
lettered
tumblers
that
could
be
rotated
to
spell
different
words.
"Amazing,
isn't
it?"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
glanced
up.
"I
don't
know.
What
the
hell
is
it?"
Now
there
was
a
glint
in
Sophie's
eye.
"My
grandfather
used
to
craft
these
as
a
hobby.
They
were
invented
by
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
Even
in
the
diffuse
light,
Sophie
could
see
Langdon'
s
surprise.
"Da
Vinci?"
he
muttered,
looking
again
at
the
canister.
"Yes.
It's
called
a
cryptex.
According
to
my
grandfather,
the
blueprints
come
from
one
of
Da
Vinci's
secret
diaries."
"What
is
it
for?"
Considering
tonight's
events,
Sophie
knew
the
answer
might
have
some
interesting
implications.
"It's
a
vault,"
she
said.
"For
storing
secret
information."
Langdon's
eyes
widened
further.
Sophie
explained
that
creating
models
of
Da
Vinci's
inventions
was
one
of
her
grandfather's
best
loved
hobbies.
A
talented
craftsman
who
spent
hours
in
his
wood
and
metal
shop,
Jacques
Sauniere
enjoyed
imitating
master
craftsmen
Faberge,
assorted
cloisonne
artisans,
and
the
less
artistic,
but
far
more
practical,
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
Even
a
cursory
glance
through
Da
Vinci's
journals
revealed
why
the
luminary
was
as
notorious
for
his
lack
of
follow
through
as
he
was
famous
for
his
brilliance.
Da
Vinci
had
drawn
up
blueprints
for
hundreds
of
inventions
he
had
never
built.
One
of
Jacques
Sauniere's
favorite
pastimes
was
bringing
Da
Vinci's
more
obscure
brainstorms
to
life
timepieces,
water
pumps,
cryptexes,
and
even
a
fully
articulated
model
of
a
medieval
French
knight,
which
now
stood
proudly
on
the
desk
in
his
office.
Designed
by
Da
Vinci
in
1495
as
an
outgrowth
of
his
earliest
anatomy
and
kinesiology
studies,
the
internal
mechanism
of
the
robot
knight
possessed
accurate
joints
and
tendons,
and
was
designed
to
sit
up,
wave
its
arms,
and
move
its
head
via
a
flexible
neck
while
opening
and
closing
an
anatomically
correct
jaw.
This
armor
clad
knight,
Sophie
had
always
believed,
was
the
most
beautiful
object
her
grandfather
had
ever
built
that
was,
until
she
had
seen
the
cryptex
in
this
rosewood
box.
"He
made
me
one
of
these
when
I
was
little,"
Sophie
said.
"But
I've
never
seen
one
so
ornate
and
large."
Langdon's
eyes
had
never
left
the
box.
"I've
never
heard
of
a
cryptex."
Sophie
was
not
surprised.
Most
of
Leonardo's
unbuilt
inventions
had
never
been
studied
or
even
named.
The
term
cryptex
possibly
had
been
her
grandfather's
creation,
an
apt
title
for
this
device
that
used
the
science
of
cryptology
to
protect
information
written
on
the
contained
scroll
or
codex.
Da
Vinci
had
been
a
cryptology
pioneer,
Sophie
knew,
although
he
was
seldom
given
credit.
Sophie's
university
instructors,
while
presenting
computer
encryption
methods
for
securing
data,
praised
modern
cryptologists
like
Zimmerman
and
Schneier
but
failed
to
mention
that
it
was
Leonardo
who
had
invented
one
of
the
first
rudimentary
forms
of
public
key
encryption
centuries
ago.
Sophie's
grandfather,
of
course,
had
been
the
one
to
tell
her
all
about
that.
As
their
armored
truck
roared
down
the
highway,
Sophie
explained
to
Langdon
that
the
cryptex
had
been
Da
Vinci's
solution
to
the
dilemma
of
sending
secure
messages
over
long
distances.
In
an
era
without
telephones
or
e
mail,
anyone
wanting
to
convey
private
information
to
someone
far
away
had
no
option
but
to
write
it
down
and
then
trust
a
messenger
to
carry
the
letter.
Unfortunately,
if
a
messenger
suspected
the
letter
might
contain
valuable
information,
he
could
make
far
more
money
selling
the
information
to
adversaries
than
he
could
delivering
the
letter
properly.
Many
great
minds
in
history
had
invented
cryptologic
solutions
to
the
challenge
of
data
protection:
Julius
Caesar
devised
a
code
writing
scheme
called
the
Caesar
Box;
Mary,
Queen
of
Scots
created
a
transposition
cipher
and
sent
secret
communiques
from
prison;
and
the
brilliant
Arab
scientist
