carved
inlay
a
five
petal
rose.
He
had
seen
this
type
of
rose
many
times.
"The
five
petal
rose,"
he
whispered,
"is
a
Priory
symbol
for
the
Holy
Grail."
Sophie
turned
and
looked
at
him.
Langdon
could
see
what
she
was
thinking,
and
he
was
thinking
it
too.
The
dimensions
of
the
box,
the
apparent
weight
of
its
contents,
and
a
Priory
symbol
for
the
Grail
all
seemed
to
imply
one
unfathomable
conclusion.
The
Cup
of
Christ
is
in
this
wooden
box.
Langdon
again
told
himself
it
was
impossible.
"It's
a
perfect
size,"
Sophie
whispered,
"to
hold
a
chalice."
It
can
't
be
a
chalice.
Sophie
pulled
the
box
toward
her
across
the
table,
preparing
to
open
it.
As
she
moved
it,
though,
something
unexpected
happened.
The
box
let
out
an
odd
gurgling
sound.
Langdon
did
a
double
take.
There's
liquid
inside?
Sophie
looked
equally
confused.
"Did
you
just
hear?"
Langdon
nodded,
lost.
"Liquid."
Reaching
forward,
Sophie
slowly
unhooked
the
clasp
and
raised
the
lid.
The
object
inside
was
unlike
anything
Langdon
had
ever
seen.
One
thing
was
immediately
clear
to
both
of
them,
however.
This
was
definitely
not
the
Cup
of
Christ.
"The
police
are
blocking
the
street,"
Andre
Vernet
said,
walking
into
the
waiting
room.
"Getting
you
out
will
be
difficult."
As
he
closed
the
door
behind
him,
Vernet
saw
the
heavy
duty
plastic
case
on
the
conveyor
belt
and
halted
in
his
tracks.
My
God!
They
accessed
Sauniere's
account?
Sophie
and
Langdon
were
at
the
table,
huddling
over
what
looked
to
be
a
large
wooden
jewelry
box.
Sophie
immediately
closed
the
lid
and
looked
up.
"We
had
the
account
number
after
all,"
she
said.
Vernet
was
speechless.
This
changed
everything.
He
respectfully
diverted
his
eyes
from
the
box
and
tried
to
figure
out
his
next
move.
have
to
get
them
out
of
the
bank!
But
with
the
police
already
having
set
up
a
roadblock,
Vernet
could
imagine
only
one
way
to
do
that.
"Mademoiselle
Neveu,
if
I
can
get
you
safely
out
of
the
bank,
will
you
be
taking
the
item
with
you
or
returning
it
to
the
vault
before
you
leave?"
Sophie
glanced
at
Langdon
and
then
back
to
Vernet.
"We
need
to
take
it."
Vernet
nodded.
"Very
well.
Then
whatever
the
item
is,
I
suggest
you
wrap
it
in
your
jacket
as
we
move
through
the
hallways.
I
would
prefer
nobody
else
see
it."
As
Langdon
shed
his
jacket,
Vernet
hurried
over
to
the
conveyor
belt,
closed
the
now
empty
crate,
and
typed
a
series
of
simple
commands.
The
conveyor
belt
began
moving
again,
carrying
the
plastic
container
back
down
to
the
vault.
Pulling
the
gold
key
from
the
podium,
he
handed
it
to
Sophie.
"This
way
please.
Hurry."
When
they
reached
the
rear
loading
dock,
Vernet
could
see
the
flash
of
police
lights
filtering
through
the
underground
garage.
He
frowned.
They
were
probably
blocking
the
ramp.
Am
I
really
going
to
try
to
pull
this
off?
He
was
sweating
now.
Vernet
motioned
to
one
of
the
bank's
small
armored
trucks.
Transport
siir
was
another
service
offered
by
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich.
"Get
in
the
cargo
hold,"
he
said,
heaving
open
the
massive
rear
door
and
motioning
to
the
glistening
steel
compartment.
"I'll
be
right
back."
As
Sophie
and
Langdon
climbed
in,
Vernet
hurried
across
the
loading
dock
to
the
dock
overseer's
office,
let
himself
in,
collected
the
keys
for
the
truck,
and
found
a
driver's
uniform
jacket
and
cap.
Shedding
his
own
suit
coat
and
tie,
he
began
to
put
on
the
driver's
jacket.
Reconsidering,
he
donned
a
shoulder
holster
beneath
the
uniform.
On
his
way
out,
he
grabbed
a
driver's
pistol
from
the
rack,
put
in
a
clip,
and
stuffed
it
in
the
holster,
buttoning
his
uniform
over
it.
Returning
to
the
truck,
Vernet
pulled
the
driver's
cap
down
low
and
peered
in
at
Sophie
and
Langdon,
who
were
standing
inside
the
empty
steel
box.
"You'll
want
this
on,"
Vernet
said,
reaching
inside
and
flicking
a
wall
switch
to
illuminate
the
lone
courtesy
bulb
on
the
hold's
ceiling.
"And
you'd
better
sit
down.
Not
a
sound
on
our
way
out
the
gate."
Sophie
and
Langdon
sat
down
on
the
metal
floor.
Langdon
cradled
the
treasure
wadded
in
his
tweed
jacket.
Swinging
the
heavy
doors
closed,
Vernet
locked
them
inside.
Then
he
got
in
behind
the
wheel
and
revved
the
engine.
As
the
armored
truck
lumbered
toward
the
top
of
the
ramp,
Vernet
could
feel
the
sweat
already
collecting
beneath
his
driver's
cap.
He
could
see
there
were
far
more
police
lights
in
front
than
he
had
imagined.
As
the
truck
powered
up
the
ramp,
the
interior
gate
swung
inward
to
let
him
pass.
Vernet
advanced
and
waited
while
the
gate
behind
him
closed
before
pulling
forward
and
tripping
the
next
sensor.
The
second
gate
opened,
and
the
exit
beckoned.
Except
for
the
police
car
blocking
the
top
of
the
ramp.
Vernet
dabbed
his
brow
and
pulled
forward.
A
lanky
officer
stepped
out
and
waved
him
to
a
stop
a
few
meters
from
the
roadblock.
Four
patrol
cars
were
parked
out
front.
Vernet
stopped.
Pulling
his
driver's
cap
down
farther,
he
effected
as
rough
a
facade
as
his
cultured
upbringing
would
allow.
Not
budging
from
behind
the
wheel,
he
opened
the
door
and
gazed
down
at
the
agent,
whose
face
was
stern
and
sallow.
"Qu'est
ce
qui
se
passe?"
Vernet
asked,
his
tone
rough.
"Je
suis
Jerome
Collet,
"
the
agent
said.
"Lieutenant
Police
Judiciaire.
"
He
motioned
to
the
truck's
cargo
hold.
"Qu'est
ce
qu'ily
a
la
dedans?"
"Hell
if
I
know,"
Vernet
replied
in
crude
French.
"I'm
only
a
driver."
Collet
looked
unimpressed.
"We're
looking
for
two
criminals."
Vernet
laughed.
"Then
you
came
to
the
right
spot.
Some
of
these
bastards
I
drive
for
have
so
much
money
they
must
be
criminals."
The
agent
held
up
a
passport
picture
of
Robert
Langdon.
"Was
this
man
in
your
bank
tonight?"
Vernet
shrugged.
"No
clue.
I'm
a
dock
rat.
They
don't
let
us
