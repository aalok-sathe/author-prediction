off.
As
Langdon
stood
alone
and
watched
the
departing
taillights,
he
realized
he
could
easily
reconsider,
exit
the
courtyard,
grab
a
taxi,
and
head
home
to
bed.
Something
told
him
it
was
probably
a
lousy
idea.
As
he
moved
toward
the
mist
of
the
fountains,
Langdon
had
the
uneasy
sense
he
was
crossing
an
imaginary
threshold
into
another
world.
The
dreamlike
quality
of
the
evening
was
settling
around
him
again.
Twenty
minutes
ago
he
had
been
asleep
in
his
hotel
room.
Now
he
was
standing
in
front
of
a
transparent
pyramid
built
by
the
Sphinx,
waiting
for
a
policeman
they
called
the
Bull.
I'm
trapped
in
a
Salvador
Dali
painting,
he
thought.
Langdon
strode
to
the
main
entrance
an
enormous
revolving
door.
The
foyer
beyond
was
dimly
lit
and
deserted.
Do
I
knock?
Langdon
wondered
if
any
of
Harvard's
revered
Egyptologists
had
ever
knocked
on
the
front
door
of
a
pyramid
and
expected
an
answer.
He
raised
his
hand
to
bang
on
the
glass,
but
out
of
the
darkness
below,
a
figure
appeared,
striding
up
the
curving
staircase.
The
man
was
stocky
and
dark,
almost
Neanderthal,
dressed
in
a
dark
double
breasted
suit
that
strained
to
cover
his
wide
shoulders.
He
advanced
with
unmistakable
authority
on
squat,
powerful
legs.
He
was
speaking
on
his
cell
phone
but
finished
the
call
as
he
arrived.
He
motioned
for
Langdon
to
enter.
"I
am
Bezu
Fache,"
he
announced
as
Langdon
pushed
through
the
revolving
door.
"Captain
of
the
Central
Directorate
Judicial
Police."
His
tone
was
fitting
a
guttural
rumble
like
a
gathering
storm.
Langdon
held
out
his
hand
to
shake.
"Robert
Langdon."
Fache's
enormous
palm
wrapped
around
Langdon's
with
crushing
force.
"I
saw
the
photo,"
Langdon
said.
"Your
agent
said
Jacques
Sauniere
himself
did
"Mr.
Langdon,"
Fache's
ebony
eyes
locked
on.
"What
you
see
in
the
photo
is
only
the
beginning
of
what
Sauniere
did."
Captain
Bezu
Fache
carried
himself
like
an
angry
ox,
with
his
wide
shoulders
thrown
back
and
his
chin
tucked
hard
into
his
chest.
His
dark
hair
was
slicked
back
with
oil,
accentuating
an
arrow
like
widow's
peak
that
divided
his
jutting
brow
and
preceded
him
like
the
prow
of
a
battleship.
As
he
advanced,
his
dark
eyes
seemed
to
scorch
the
earth
before
him,
radiating
a
fiery
clarity
that
forecast
his
reputation
for
unblinking
severity
in
all
matters.
Langdon
followed
the
captain
down
the
famous
marble
staircase
into
the
sunken
atrium
beneath
the
glass
pyramid.
As
they
descended,
they
passed
between
two
armed
Judicial
Police
guards
with
machine
guns.
The
message
was
clear:
Nobody
goes
in
or
out
tonight
without
the
blessing
of
Captain
Fache.
Descending
below
ground
level,
Langdon
fought
a
rising
trepidation.
Fache's
presence
was
anything
but
welcoming,
and
the
Louvre
itself
had
an
almost
sepulchral
aura
at
this
hour.
The
staircase,
like
the
aisle
of
a
dark
movie
theater,
was
illuminated
by
subtle
tread
lighting
embedded
in
each
step.
Langdon
could
hear
his
own
footsteps
reverberating
off
the
glass
overhead.
As
he
glanced
up,
he
could
see
the
faint
illuminated
wisps
of
mist
from
the
fountains
fading
away
outside
the
transparent
roof.
"Do
you
approve?"
Fache
asked,
nodding
upward
with
his
broad
chin.
Langdon
sighed,
too
tired
to
play
games.
"Yes,
your
pyramid
is
magnificent."
Fache
grunted.
"A
scar
on
the
face
of
Paris."
Strike
one.
Langdon
sensed
his
host
was
a
hard
man
to
please.
He
wondered
if
Fache
had
any
idea
that
this
pyramid,
at
President
Mitterrand's
explicit
demand,
had
been
constructed
of
exactly
666
panes
of
glass
a
bizarre
request
that
had
always
been
a
hot
topic
among
conspiracy
buffs
who
claimed
666
was
the
number
of
Satan.
Langdon
decided
not
to
bring
it
up.
As
they
dropped
farther
into
the
subterranean
foyer,
the
yawning
space
slowly
emerged
from
the
shadows.
Built
fifty
seven
feet
beneath
ground
level,
the
Louvre's
newly
constructed
70,000
square
foot
lobby
spread
out
like
an
endless
grotto.
Constructed
in
warm
ocher
marble
to
be
compatible
with
the
honey
colored
stone
of
the
Louvre
facade
above,
the
subterranean
hall
was
usually
vibrant
with
sunlight
and
tourists.
Tonight,
however,
the
lobby
was
barren
and
dark,
giving
the
entire
space
a
cold
and
crypt
like
atmosphere.
"And
the
museum's
regular
security
staff?"
Langdon
asked.
"En
quarantaine,
"
Fache
replied,
sounding
as
if
Langdon
were
questioning
the
integrity
of
Fache's
team.
"Obviously,
someone
gained
entry
tonight
who
should
not
have.
All
Louvre
night
wardens
are
in
the
Sully
Wing
being
questioned.
My
own
agents
have
taken
over
museum
security
for
the
evening."
Langdon
nodded,
moving
quickly
to
keep
pace
with
Fache.
"How
well
did
you
know
Jacques
Sauniere?"
the
captain
asked.
"Actually,
not
at
all.
We'd
never
met."
Fache
looked
surprised.
"Your
first
meeting
was
to
be
tonight?"
"Yes.
We'd
planned
to
meet
at
the
American
University
reception
following
my
lecture,
but
he
never
showed
up."
Fache
scribbled
some
notes
in
a
little
book.
As
they
walked,
Langdon
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
Louvre's
lesser
known
pyramid
La
Pyramide
Inversee
a
huge
inverted
skylight
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
like
a
stalactite
in
an
adjoining
section
of
the
entresol.
Fache
guided
Langdon
up
a
short
set
of
stairs
to
the
mouth
of
an
arched
tunnel,
over
which
a
sign
read:
DENON.
The
Denon
Wing
was
the
most
famous
of
the
Louvre's
three
main
sections.
"Who
requested
tonight's
meeting?"
Fache
asked
suddenly.
"You
or
he?"
The
question
seemed
odd.
"Mr.
Sauniere
did,"
Langdon
replied
as
they
entered
the
tunnel.
"His
secretary
contacted
me
a
few
weeks
ago
via
e
mail.
She
said
the
curator
had
heard
I
would
be
lecturing
in
Paris
this
month
and
wanted
to
discuss
something
with
me
while
I
was
here."
"Discuss
what?"
"I
don't
know.
Art,
I
imagine.
We
share
similar
interests."
Fache
looked
skeptical.
"You
have
no
idea
what
your
meeting
was
about?"
Langdon
did
not.
He'd
been
curious
at
the
time
but
had
not
felt
comfortable
demanding
specifics.
The
venerated
Jacques
Sauniere
had
a
renowned
penchant
for
privacy
and
granted
very
few
meetings;
Langdon
was
