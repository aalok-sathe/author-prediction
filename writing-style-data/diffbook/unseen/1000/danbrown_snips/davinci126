I
would
have
obtained
the
keystone
without
complication.
How
was
I
to
imagine
the
Grand
Master
would
go
to
such
ends
to
deceive
me
and
bequeath
the
keystone
to
an
estranged
granddaughter?"
Teabing
looked
at
Sophie
with
disdain.
"Someone
so
unqualified
to
hold
this
knowledge
that
she
required
a
symbologist
baby
sitter."
Teabing
glanced
back
at
Langdon.
"Fortunately,
Robert,
your
involvement
turned
out
to
be
my
saving
grace.
Rather
than
the
keystone
remaining
locked
in
the
depository
bank
forever,
you
extracted
it
and
walked
into
my
home."
Where
else
would
I
run?
Langdon
thought.
The
community
of
Grail
historians
is
small,
and
Teabing
and
I
have
a
history
together.
Teabing
now
looked
smug.
"When
I
learned
Sauniere
left
you
a
dying
message,
I
had
a
pretty
good
idea
you
were
holding
valuable
Priory
information.
Whether
it
was
the
keystone
itself,
or
information
on
where
to
find
it,
I
was
not
sure.
But
with
the
police
on
your
heels,
I
had
a
sneaking
suspicion
you
might
arrive
on
my
doorstep."
Langdon
glared.
"And
if
we
had
not?"
"I
was
formulating
a
plan
to
extend
you
a
helping
hand.
One
way
or
another,
the
keystone
was
coming
to
Chateau
Villette.
The
fact
that
you
delivered
it
into
my
waiting
hands
only
serves
as
proof
that
my
cause
is
just."
"What!"
Langdon
was
appalled.
"Silas
was
supposed
to
break
in
and
steal
the
keystone
from
you
in
Chateau
Villette
thus
removing
you
from
the
equation
without
hurting
you,
and
exonerating
me
from
any
suspicion
of
complicity.
However,
when
I
saw
the
intricacy
of
Sauniere's
codes,
I
decided
to
include
you
both
in
my
quest
a
bit
longer.
I
could
have
Silas
steal
the
keystone
later,
once
I
knew
enough
to
carry
on
alone."
"The
Temple
Church,"
Sophie
said,
her
tone
awash
with
betrayal.
Light
begins
to
dawn,
Teabing
thought.
The
Temple
Church
was
the
perfect
location
to
steal
the
keystone
from
Robert
and
Sophie,
and
its
apparent
relevance
to
the
poem
made
it
a
plausible
decoy.
Remy's
orders
had
been
clear
stay
out
of
sight
while
Silas
recovers
the
keystone.
Unfortunately,
Langdon's
threat
to
smash
the
keystone
on
the
chapel
floor
had
caused
Remy
to
panic.
If
only
Remy
had
not
revealed
himself,
Teabing
thought
ruefully,
recalling
his
own
mock
kidnapping.
Remy
was
the
sole
link
to
me,
and
he
showed
his
face!
Fortunately,
Silas
remained
unaware
of
Teabing's
true
identity
and
was
easily
fooled
into
taking
him
from
the
church
and
then
watching
naively
as
Remy
pretended
to
tie
their
hostage
in
the
back
of
the
limousine.
With
the
soundproof
divider
raised,
Teabing
was
able
to
phone
Silas
in
the
front
seat,
use
the
fake
French
accent
of
the
Teacher,
and
direct
Silas
to
go
straight
to
Opus
Dei.
A
simple
anonymous
tip
to
the
police
was
all
it
would
take
to
remove
Silas
from
the
picture.
One
loose
end
tied
up.
The
other
loose
end
was
harder.
Remy.
Teabing
struggled
deeply
with
the
decision,
but
in
the
end
Remy
had
proven
himself
a
liability.
Every
Grail
quest
requires
sacrifice.
The
cleanest
solution
had
been
staring
Teabing
in
the
face
from
the
limousine's
wet
bar
a
flask,
some
cognac,
and
a
can
of
peanuts.
The
powder
at
the
bottom
of
the
can
would
be
more
than
enough
to
trigger
Remy's
deadly
allergy.
When
Remy
parked
the
limo
on
Horse
Guards
Parade,
Teabing
climbed
out
of
the
back,
walked
to
the
side
passenger
door,
and
sat
in
the
front
next
to
Remy.
Minutes
later,
Teabing
got
out
of
the
car,
climbed
into
the
rear
again,
cleaned
up
the
evidence,
and
finally
emerged
to
carry
out
the
final
phase
of
his
mission.
Westminster
Abbey
had
been
a
short
walk,
and
although
Teabing's
leg
braces,
crutches,
and
gun
had
set
off
the
metal
detector,
the
rent
a
cops
never
knew
what
to
do.
Do
we
ask
him
to
remove
his
braces
and
crawl
through?
Do
we
frisk
his
deformed
body?
Teabing
presented
the
flustered
guards
a
far
easier
solution
an
embossed
card
identifying
him
as
Knight
of
the
Realm.
The
poor
fellows
practically
tripped
over
one
another
ushering
him
in.
Now,
eyeing
the
bewildered
Langdon
and
Neveu,
Teabing
resisted
the
urge
to
reveal
how
he
had
brilliantly
implicated
Opus
Dei
in
the
plot
that
would
soon
bring
about
the
demise
of
the
entire
Church.
That
would
have
to
wait.
Right
now
there
was
work
to
do.
"Mes
amis,
"
Teabing
declared
in
flawless
French,
"vous
ne
trouvezpas
le
Saint
Graal,
c'est
le
Saint
Graal
qui
vous
trouve.
"
He
smiled.
"Our
paths
together
could
not
be
more
clear.
The
Grail
has
found
us."
Silence.
He
spoke
to
them
in
a
whisper
now.
"Listen.
Can
you
hear
it?
The
Grail
is
speaking
to
us
across
the
centuries.
She
is
begging
to
be
saved
from
the
Priory's
folly.
I
implore
you
both
to
recognize
this
opportunity.
There
could
not
possibly
be
three
more
capable
people
assembled
at
this
moment
to
break
the
final
code
and
open
the
cryptex."
Teabing
paused,
his
eyes
alight.
"We
need
to
swear
an
oath
together.
A
pledge
of
faith
to
one
another.
A
knight's
allegiance
to
uncover
the
truth
and
make
it
known."
Sophie
stared
deep
into
Teabing's
eyes
and
spoke
in
a
steely
tone.
"I
will
never
swear
an
oath
with
my
grandfather's
murderer.
Except
an
oath
that
I
will
see
you
go
to
prison."
Teabing's
heart
turned
grave,
then
resolute.
"I
am
sorry
you
feel
that
way,
mademoiselle."
He
turned
and
aimed
the
gun
at
Langdon.
"And
you,
Robert?
Are
you
with
me,
or
against
me?"
Bishop
Manuel
Aringarosa's
body
had
endured
many
kinds
of
pain,
and
yet
the
searing
heat
of
the
bullet
wound
in
his
chest
felt
profoundly
foreign
to
him.
Deep
and
grave.
Not
a
wound
of
the
flesh
but
closer
to
the
soul.
He
opened
his
eyes,
trying
to
see,
but
the
rain
on
his
face
blurred
his
vision.
Where
am
I?
He
could
feel
powerful
arms
holding
him,
carrying
his
limp
body
like
a
rag
