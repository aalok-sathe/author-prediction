arm
wavering
now.
"If
you
don't
take
it
soon,
I'm
afraid
I
shall
drop
it!"
He
swayed
perilously.
Silas
stepped
quickly
forward
to
take
the
stone,
and
as
he
did,
the
man
on
crutches
lost
his
balance.
The
crutch
slid
out
from
under
him,
and
he
began
to
topple
sideways
to
his
right.
No!
Silas
lunged
to
save
the
stone,
lowering
his
weapon
in
the
process.
But
the
keystone
was
moving
away
from
him
now.
As
the
man
fell
to
his
right,
his
left
hand
swung
backward,
and
the
cylinder
tumbled
from
his
palm
onto
the
couch.
At
the
same
instant,
the
metal
crutch
that
had
been
sliding
out
from
under
the
man
seemed
to
accelerate,
cutting
a
wide
arc
through
the
air
toward
Silas's
leg.
Splinters
of
pain
tore
up
Silas's
body
as
the
crutch
made
perfect
contact
with
his
cilice,
crushing
the
barbs
into
his
already
raw
flesh.
Buckling,
Silas
crumpled
to
his
knees,
causing
the
belt
to
cut
deeper
still.
The
pistol
discharged
with
a
deafening
roar,
the
bullet
burying
itself
harmlessly
in
the
floorboards
as
Silas
fell.
Before
he
could
raise
the
gun
and
fire
again,
the
woman's
foot
caught
him
square
beneath
the
jaw.
At
the
bottom
of
the
driveway,
Collet
heard
the
gunshot.
The
muffled
pop
sent
panic
through
his
veins.
With
Fache
on
the
way,
Collet
had
already
relinquished
any
hopes
of
claiming
personal
credit
for
finding
Langdon
tonight.
But
Collet
would
be
damned
if
Fache's
ego
landed
him
in
front
of
a
Ministerial
Review
Board
for
negligent
police
procedure.
A
weapon
was
discharged
inside
a
private
home!
And
you
waited
at
the
bottom
of
the
driveway?
Collet
knew
the
opportunity
for
a
stealth
approach
had
long
since
passed.
He
also
knew
if
he
stood
idly
by
for
another
second,
his
entire
career
would
be
history
by
morning.
Eyeing
the
estate's
iron
gate,
he
made
his
decision.
"Tie
on,
and
pull
it
down."
In
the
distant
recesses
of
his
groggy
mind,
Robert
Langdon
had
heard
the
gunshot.
He'd
also
heard
a
scream
of
pain.
His
own?
A
jackhammer
was
boring
a
hole
into
the
back
of
his
cranium.
Somewhere
nearby,
people
were
talking.
"Where
the
devil
were
you?"
Teabing
was
yelling.
The
manservant
hurried
in.
"What
happened?
Oh
my
God!
Who
is
that?
I'll
call
the
police!"
"Bloody
hell!
Don't
call
the
police.
Make
yourself
useful
and
get
us
something
with
which
to
restrain
this
monster."
"And
some
ice!"
Sophie
called
after
him.
Langdon
drifted
out
again.
More
voices.
Movement.
Now
he
was
seated
on
the
divan.
Sophie
was
holding
an
ice
pack
to
his
head.
His
skull
ached.
As
Langdon's
vision
finally
began
to
clear,
he
found
himself
staring
at
a
body
on
the
floor.
Am
I
hallucinating?
The
massive
body
of
an
albino
monk
lay
bound
and
gagged
with
duct
tape.
His
chin
was
split
open,
and
the
robe
over
his
right
thigh
was
soaked
with
blood.
He
too
appeared
to
be
just
now
coming
to.
Langdon
turned
to
Sophie.
"Who
is
that?
What
happened?"
Teabing
hobbled
over.
"You
were
rescued
by
a
knight
brandishing
an
Excalibur
made
by
Acme
Orthopedic."
Huh?
Langdon
tried
to
sit
up.
Sophie's
touch
was
shaken
but
tender.
"Just
give
yourself
a
minute,
Robert."
"I
fear,"
Teabing
said,
"that
I've
just
demonstrated
for
your
lady
friend
the
unfortunate
benefit
of
my
condition.
It
seems
everyone
underestimates
you."
From
his
seat
on
the
divan,
Langdon
gazed
down
at
the
monk
and
tried
to
imagine
what
had
happened.
"He
was
wearing
a
cilice,
"
Teabing
explained.
"A
what?"
Teabing
pointed
to
a
bloody
strip
of
barbed
leather
that
lay
on
the
floor.
"A
Discipline
belt.
He
wore
it
on
his
thigh.
I
took
careful
aim."
Langdon
rubbed
his
head.
He
knew
of
Discipline
belts.
"But
how
did
you
know?"
Teabing
grinned.
"Christianity
is
my
field
of
study,
Robert,
and
there
are
certain
sects
who
wear
their
hearts
on
their
sleeves."
He
pointed
his
crutch
at
the
blood
soaking
through
the
monk's
cloak.
"As
it
were."
"Opus
Dei,"
Langdon
whispered,
recalling
recent
media
coverage
of
several
prominent
Boston
businessmen
who
were
members
of
Opus
Dei.
Apprehensive
coworkers
had
falsely
and
publicly
accused
the
men
of
wearing
Discipline
belts
beneath
their
three
piece
suits.
In
fact,
the
three
men
did
no
such
thing.
Like
many
members
of
Opus
Dei,
these
businessmen
were
at
the
"supernumerary"
stage
and
practiced
no
corporal
mortification
at
all.
They
were
devout
Catholics,
caring
fathers
to
their
children,
and
deeply
dedicated
members
of
the
community.
Not
surprisingly,
the
media
spotlighted
their
spiritual
commitment
only
briefly
before
moving
on
to
the
shock
value
of
the
sect's
more
stringent
"numerary"
members
members
like
the
monk
now
lying
on
the
floor
before
Langdon.
Teabing
was
looking
closely
at
the
bloody
belt.
"But
why
would
Opus
Dei
be
trying
to
find
the
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon
was
too
groggy
to
consider
it.
"Robert,"
Sophie
said,
walking
to
the
wooden
box.
"What's
this?"
She
was
holding
the
small
Rose
inlay
he
had
removed
from
the
lid.
"It
covered
an
engraving
on
the
box.
I
think
the
text
might
tell
us
how
to
open
the
keystone."
Before
Sophie
and
Teabing
could
respond,
a
sea
of
blue
police
lights
and
sirens
erupted
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
began
snaking
up
the
half
mile
driveway.
Teabing
frowned.
"My
friends,
it
seems
we
have
a
decision
to
make.
And
we'd
better
make
it
fast."
Collet
and
his
agents
burst
through
the
front
door
of
Sir
Leigh
Teabing's
estate
with
their
guns
drawn.
Fanning
out,
they
began
searching
all
the
rooms
on
the
first
level.
They
found
a
bullet
hole
in
the
drawing
room
floor,
signs
of
a
struggle,
a
small
amount
of
blood,
a
strange,
barbed
leather
belt,
and
a
partially
used
roll
of
duct
tape.
The
entire
level
seemed
deserted.
Just
as
Collet
was
about
to
divide
his
men
to
search
the
basement
and
grounds
behind
the
house,
he
heard
voices
on
the
level
above
them.
"They're
upstairs!"
Rushing
up
the
wide
staircase,
