New
York,
he
stared
out
at
the
skyline
in
disillusionment
for
days,
overwhelmed
with
sadness
for
the
future
of
Christianity.
It
was
several
weeks
later
that
he
received
the
phone
call
that
changed
all
that.
The
caller
sounded
French
and
identified
himself
as
the
Teacher
a
title
common
in
the
prelature.
He
said
he
knew
of
the
Vatican's
plans
to
pull
support
from
Opus
Dei.
How
could
he
know
that?
Aringarosa
wondered.
He
had
hoped
only
a
handful
of
Vatican
power
brokers
knew
of
Opus
Dei's
impending
annulment.
Apparently
the
word
was
out.
When
it
came
to
containing
gossip,
no
walls
in
the
world
were
as
porous
as
those
surrounding
Vatican
City.
"I
have
ears
everywhere,
Bishop,"
the
Teacher
whispered,
"and
with
these
ears
I
have
gained
certain
knowledge.
With
your
help,
I
can
uncover
the
hiding
place
of
a
sacred
relic
that
will
bring
you
enormous
power
enough
power
to
make
the
Vatican
bow
before
you.
Enough
power
to
save
the
Faith."
He
paused.
"Not
just
for
Opus
Dei.
But
for
all
of
us."
The
Lord
taketh
away
and
the
Lord
giveth.
Aringarosa
felt
a
glorious
ray
of
hope.
"Tell
me
your
plan."
Bishop
Aringarosa
was
unconscious
when
the
doors
of
St.
Mary's
Hospital
hissed
open.
Silas
lurched
into
the
entryway
delirious
with
exhaustion.
Dropping
to
his
knees
on
the
tile
floor,
he
cried
out
for
help.
Everyone
in
the
reception
area
gaped
in
wonderment
at
the
half
naked
albino
offering
forth
a
bleeding
clergyman.
The
doctor
who
helped
Silas
heave
the
delirious
bishop
onto
a
gurney
looked
gloomy
as
he
felt
Aringarosa's
pulse.
"He's
lost
a
lot
of
blood.
I
am
not
hopeful."
Aringarosa's
eyes
flickered,
and
he
returned
for
a
moment,
his
gaze
locating
Silas.
"My
child"
Silas's
soul
thundered
with
remorse
and
rage.
"Father,
if
it
takes
my
lifetime,
I
will
find
the
one
who
deceived
us,
and
I
will
kill
him."
Aringarosa
shook
his
head,
looking
sad
as
they
prepared
to
wheel
him
away.
"Silas
if
you
have
learned
nothing
from
me,
please
learn
this."
He
took
Silas's
hand
and
gave
it
a
firm
squeeze.
"Forgiveness
is
God's
greatest
gift."
"But
Father"
Aringarosa
closed
his
eyes.
"Silas,
you
must
pray."
Robert
Langdon
stood
beneath
the
lofty
cupola
of
the
deserted
Chapter
House
and
stared
into
the
barrel
of
Leigh
Teabing's
gun.
Robert,
are
you
with
me,
or
against
me?
The
Royal
Historian's
words
echoed
in
the
silence
of
Langdon's
mind.
There
was
no
viable
response,
Langdon
knew.
Answer
yes,
and
he
would
be
selling
out
Sophie.
Answer
no,
and
Teabing
would
have
no
choice
but
to
kill
them
both.
Langdon's
years
in
the
classroom
had
not
imbued
him
with
any
skills
relevant
to
handling
confrontations
at
gunpoint,
but
the
classroom
had
taught
him
something
about
answering
paradoxical
questions.
When
a
question
has
no
correct
answer,
there
is
only
one
honest
response.
The
gray
area
between
yes
and
no.
Silence.
Staring
at
the
cryptex
in
his
hands,
Langdon
chose
simply
to
walk
away.
Without
ever
lifting
his
eyes,
he
stepped
backward,
out
into
the
room's
vast
empty
spaces.
Neutral
ground.
He
hoped
his
focus
on
the
cryptex
signaled
Teabing
that
collaboration
might
be
an
option,
and
that
his
silence
signaled
Sophie
he
had
not
abandoned
her.
All
the
while
buying
time
to
think.
The
act
of
thinking,
Langdon
suspected,
was
exactly
what
Teabing
wanted
him
to
do.
That's
why
he
handed
me
the
cryptex.
So
I
could
feel
the
weight
of
my
decision.
The
British
historian
hoped
the
touch
of
the
Grand
Master's
cryptex
would
make
Langdon
fully
grasp
the
magnitude
of
its
contents,
coaxing
his
academic
curiosity
to
overwhelm
all
else,
forcing
him
to
realize
that
failure
to
unlock
the
keystone
would
mean
the
loss
of
history
itself.
With
Sophie
at
gunpoint
across
the
room,
Langdon
feared
that
discovering
the
cryptex's
elusive
password
would
be
his
only
remaining
hope
of
bartering
her
release.
If
I
can
free
the
map,
Teabing
will
negotiate.
Forcing
his
mind
to
this
critical
task,
Langdon
moved
slowly
toward
the
far
windows
allowing
his
mind
to
fill
with
the
numerous
astronomical
images
on
Newton's
tomb.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
Turning
his
back
to
the
others,
he
walked
toward
the
towering
windows,
searching
for
any
inspiration
in
their
stained
glass
mosaics.
There
was
none.
Place
yourself
in
Sauniere's
mind,
he
urged,
gazing
outward
now
into
College
Garden.
What
would
he
believe
is
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
Newton's
tomb?
Images
of
stars,
comets,
and
planets
twinkled
in
the
falling
rain,
but
Langdon
ignored
them.
Sauniere
was
not
a
man
of
science.
He
was
a
man
of
humanity,
of
art,
of
history.
The
sacred
feminine
the
chalice
the
Rose
the
banished
Mary
Magdalene
the
decline
of
the
goddess
the
Holy
Grail.
Legend
had
always
portrayed
the
Grail
as
a
cruel
mistress,
dancing
in
the
shadows
just
out
of
sight,
whispering
in
your
ear,
luring
you
one
more
step
and
then
evaporating
into
the
mist.
Gazing
out
at
the
rustling
trees
of
College
Garden,
Langdon
sensed
her
playful
presence.
The
signs
were
everywhere.
Like
a
taunting
silhouette
emerging
from
the
fog,
the
branches
of
Britain's
oldest
apple
tree
burgeoned
with
five
petaled
blossoms,
all
glistening
like
Venus.
The
goddess
was
in
the
garden
now.
She
was
dancing
in
the
rain,
singing
songs
of
the
ages,
peeking
out
from
behind
the
bud
filled
branches
as
if
to
remind
Langdon
that
the
fruit
of
knowledge
was
growing
just
beyond
his
reach.
Across
the
room,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
watched
with
confidence
as
Langdon
gazed
out
the
window
as
if
under
a
spell.
Exactly
as
I
hoped,
Teabing
thought.
He
will
come
around.
For
some
time
now,
Teabing
had
suspected
Langdon
might
hold
the
key
to
the
Grail.
It
was
no
coincidence
that
Teabing
launched
his
plan
into
action
on
the
same
night
Langdon
was
scheduled
to
meet
Jacques
Sauniere.
Listening
in
on
the
curator,
Teabing
was
certain
the
man's
eagerness
to
meet
