Remy,"
Teabing
chimed
happily.
"The
lights
are
on.
Our
lives
are
in
your
hands."
"Where
are
we
going?"
Sophie
asked.
"This
trail
continues
about
three
kilometers
into
the
forest,"
Teabing
said.
"Cutting
across
the
estate
and
then
arching
north.
Provided
we
don't
hit
any
standing
water
or
fallen
trees,
we
shall
emerge
unscathed
on
the
shoulder
of
highway
five."
Unscathed.
Langdon's
head
begged
to
differ.
He
turned
his
eyes
down
to
his
own
lap,
where
the
keystone
was
safely
stowed
in
its
wooden
box.
The
inlaid
Rose
on
the
lid
was
back
in
place,
and
although
his
head
felt
muddled,
Langdon
was
eager
to
remove
the
inlay
again
and
examine
the
engraving
beneath
more
closely.
He
unlatched
the
lid
and
began
to
raise
it
when
Teabing
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
from
behind.
"Patience,
Robert,"
Teabing
said.
"It's
bumpy
and
dark.
God
save
us
if
we
break
anything.
If
you
didn't
recognize
the
language
in
the
light,
you
won't
do
any
better
in
the
dark.
Let's
focus
on
getting
away
in
one
piece,
shall
we?
There
will
be
time
for
that
very
soon."
Langdon
knew
Teabing
was
right.
With
a
nod,
he
relatched
the
box.
The
monk
in
back
was
moaning
now,
struggling
against
his
trusses.
Suddenly,
he
began
kicking
wildly.
Teabing
spun
around
and
aimed
the
pistol
over
the
seat.
"I
can't
imagine
your
complaint,
sir.
You
trespassed
in
my
home
and
planted
a
nasty
welt
on
the
skull
of
a
dear
friend.
I
would
be
well
within
my
rights
to
shoot
you
right
now
and
leave
you
to
rot
in
the
woods."
The
monk
fell
silent.
"Are
you
sure
we
should
have
brought
him?"
Langdon
asked.
"Bloody
well
positive!"
Teabing
exclaimed.
"You're
wanted
for
murder,
Robert.
This
scoundrel
is
your
ticket
to
freedom.
The
police
apparently
want
you
badly
enough
to
have
tailed
you
to
my
home."
"My
fault,"
Sophie
said.
"The
armored
car
probably
had
a
transmitter."
"Not
the
point,"
Teabing
said.
"I'm
not
surprised
the
police
found
you,
but
I
am
surprised
that
this
Opus
Dei
character
found
you.
From
all
you've
told
me,
I
can't
imagine
how
this
man
could
have
tailed
you
to
my
home
unless
he
had
a
contact
either
within
the
Judicial
Police
or
within
the
Zurich
Depository."
Langdon
considered
it.
Bezu
Fache
certainly
seemed
intent
on
finding
a
scapegoat
for
tonight's
murders.
And
Vernet
had
turned
on
them
rather
suddenly,
although
considering
Langdon
was
being
charged
with
four
murders,
the
banker's
change
of
heart
seemed
understandable.
"This
monk
is
not
working
alone,
Robert,"
Teabing
said,
"and
until
you
learn
who
is
behind
all
this,
you
both
are
in
danger.
The
good
news,
my
friend,
is
that
you
are
now
in
the
position
of
power.
This
monster
behind
me
holds
that
information,
and
whoever
is
pulling
his
strings
has
got
to
be
quite
nervous
right
now."
Remy
was
picking
up
speed,
getting
comfortable
with
the
trail.
They
splashed
through
some
water,
climbed
a
small
rise,
and
began
descending
again.
"Robert,
could
you
be
so
kind
as
to
hand
me
that
phone?"
Teabing
pointed
to
the
car
phone
on
the
dash.
Langdon
handed
it
back,
and
Teabing
dialed
a
number.
He
waited
for
a
very
long
time
before
someone
answered.
"Richard?
Did
I
wake
you?
Of
course,
I
did.
Silly
question.
I'm
sorry.
I
have
a
small
problem.
I'm
feeling
a
bit
off.
Remy
and
I
need
to
pop
up
to
the
Isles
for
my
treatments.
Well,
right
away,
actually.
Sorry
for
the
short
notice.
Can
you
have
Elizabeth
ready
in
about
twenty
minutes?
I
know,
do
the
best
you
can.
See
you
shortly."
He
hung
up.
"Elizabeth?"
Langdon
said.
"My
plane.
She
cost
me
a
Queen's
ransom."
Langdon
turned
full
around
and
looked
at
him.
"What?"
Teabing
demanded.
"You
two
can't
expect
to
stay
in
France
with
the
entire
Judicial
Police
after
you.
London
will
be
much
safer."
Sophie
had
turned
to
Teabing
as
well.
"You
think
we
should
leave
the
country?"
"My
friends,
I
am
far
more
influential
in
the
civilized
world
than
here
in
France.
Furthermore,
the
Grail
is
believed
to
be
in
Great
Britain.
If
we
unlock
the
keystone,
I
am
certain
we
will
discover
a
map
that
indicates
we
have
moved
in
the
proper
direction."
"You're
running
a
big
risk,"
Sophie
said,
"by
helping
us.
You
won't
make
any
friends
with
the
French
police."
Teabing
gave
a
wave
of
disgust.
"I
am
finished
with
France.
I
moved
here
to
find
the
keystone.
That
work
is
now
done.
I
shan't
care
if
I
ever
again
see
Chateau
Villette."
Sophie
sounded
uncertain.
"How
will
we
get
through
airport
security?"
Teabing
chuckled.
"I
fly
from
Le
Bourget
an
executive
airfield
not
far
from
here.
French
doctors
make
me
nervous,
so
every
fortnight,
I
fly
north
to
take
my
treatments
in
England.
I
pay
for
certain
special
privileges
at
both
ends.
Once
we're
airborne,
you
can
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
you'd
like
someone
from
the
U.S.
Embassy
to
meet
us."
Langdon
suddenly
didn't
want
anything
to
do
with
the
embassy.
All
he
could
think
of
was
the
keystone,
the
inscription,
and
whether
it
would
all
lead
to
the
Grail.
He
wondered
if
Teabing
was
right
about
Britain.
Admittedly
most
modern
legends
placed
the
Grail
somewhere
in
the
United
Kingdom.
Even
King
Arthur's
mythical,
Grail
rich
Isle
of
Avalon
was
now
believed
to
be
none
other
than
Glastonbury,
England.
Wherever
the
Grail
lay,
Langdon
never
imagined
he
would
actually
be
looking
for
it.
The
Sangreal
documents.
The
true
history
of
Jesus
Christ.
The
tomb
of
Mary
Magdalene.
He
suddenly
felt
as
if
he
were
living
in
some
kind
of
limbo
tonight
a
bubble
where
the
real
world
could
not
reach
him.
"Sir?"
Remy
said.
"Are
you
truly
thinking
of
returning
to
England
for
good?"
"Remy,
you
needn't
worry,"
Teabing
assured.
"Just
because
I
am
returning
to
the
Queen's
realm
does
not
mean
I
intend
to
subject
my
palate
to
bangers
and
mash
for
the
rest
of
my
days.
