an
admonishing
glare.
"And
frankly,
sir,
considering
your
allegiance
to
the
Crown,
I'm
a
little
surprised
you
didn't
recognize
it."
In
a
flash,
Langdon
knew.
No
wonder
the
script
looks
so
damned
familiar!
Several
years
ago,
Langdon
had
attended
an
event
at
Harvard's
Fogg
Museum.
Harvard
dropout
Bill
Gates
had
returned
to
his
alma
mater
to
lend
to
the
museum
one
of
his
priceless
acquisitions
eighteen
sheets
of
paper
he
had
recently
purchased
at
auction
from
the
Armand
Hammar
Estate.
His
winning
bid
a
cool
$30.8
million.
The
author
of
the
pages
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
The
eighteen
folios
now
known
as
Leonardo's
Codex
Leicester
after
their
famous
owner,
the
Earl
of
Leicester
were
all
that
remained
of
one
of
Leonardo's
most
fascinating
notebooks:
essays
and
drawings
outlining
Da
Vinci's
progressive
theories
on
astronomy,
geology,
archaeology,
and
hydrology.
Langdon
would
never
forget
his
reaction
after
waiting
in
line
and
finally
viewing
the
priceless
parchment.
Utter
letdown.
The
pages
were
unintelligible.
Despite
being
beautifully
preserved
and
written
in
an
impeccably
neat
penmanship
crimson
ink
on
cream
paper
the
codex
looked
like
gibberish.
At
first
Langdon
thought
he
could
not
read
them
because
Da
Vinci
wrote
his
notebooks
in
an
archaic
Italian.
But
after
studying
them
more
closely,
he
realized
he
could
not
identify
a
single
Italian
word,
or
even
one
letter.
"Try
this,
sir,"
whispered
the
female
docent
at
the
display
case.
She
motioned
to
a
hand
mirror
affixed
to
the
display
on
a
chain.
Langdon
picked
it
up
and
examined
the
text
in
the
mirror's
surface.
Instantly
it
was
clear.
Langdon
had
been
so
eager
to
peruse
some
of
the
great
thinker's
ideas
that
he
had
forgotten
one
of
the
man's
numerous
artistic
talents
was
an
ability
to
write
in
a
mirrored
script
that
was
virtually
illegible
to
anyone
other
than
himself.
Historians
still
debated
whether
Da
Vinci
wrote
this
way
simply
to
amuse
himself
or
to
keep
people
from
peering
over
his
shoulder
and
stealing
his
ideas,
but
the
point
was
moot.
Da
Vinci
did
as
he
pleased.
Sophie
smiled
inwardly
to
see
that
Robert
understood
her
meaning.
"I
can
read
the
first
few
words,"
she
said.
"It's
English."
Teabing
was
still
sputtering.
"What's
going
on?"
"Reverse
text,"
Langdon
said.
"We
need
a
mirror."
"No
we
don't,"
Sophie
said.
"I
bet
this
veneer
is
thin
enough."
She
lifted
the
rosewood
box
up
to
a
canister
light
on
the
wall
and
began
examining
the
underside
of
the
lid.
Her
grandfather
couldn't
actually
write
in
reverse,
so
he
always
cheated
by
writing
normally
and
then
flipping
the
paper
over
and
tracing
the
reversed
impression.
Sophie's
guess
was
that
he
had
wood
burned
normal
text
into
a
block
of
wood
and
then
run
the
back
of
the
block
through
a
sander
until
the
wood
was
paper
thin
and
the
wood
burning
could
be
seen
through
the
wood.
Then
he'd
simply
flipped
the
piece
over,
and
laid
it
in.
As
Sophie
moved
the
lid
closer
to
the
light,
she
saw
she
was
right.
The
bright
beam
sifted
through
the
thin
layer
of
wood,
and
the
script
appeared
in
reverse
on
the
underside
of
the
lid.
Instantly
legible.
"English,"
Teabing
croaked,
hanging
his
head
in
shame.
"My
native
tongue."
At
the
rear
of
the
plane,
Remy
Legaludec
strained
to
hear
beyond
the
rumbling
engines,
but
the
conversation
up
front
was
inaudible.
Remy
did
not
like
the
way
the
night
was
progressing.
Not
at
all.
He
looked
down
at
the
bound
monk
at
his
feet.
The
man
lay
perfectly
still
now,
as
if
in
a
trance
of
acceptance,
or
perhaps,
in
silent
prayer
for
deliverance.
Fifteen
thousand
feet
in
the
air,
Robert
Langdon
felt
the
physical
world
fade
away
as
all
of
his
thoughts
converged
on
Sauniere's
mirror
image
poem,
which
was
illuminated
through
the
lid
of
the
box.

Sophie
quickly
found
some
paper
and
copied
it
down
longhand.
When
she
was
done,
the
three
of
them
took
turns
reading
the
text.
It
was
like
some
kind
of
archaeological
crossword
a
riddle
that
promised
to
reveal
how
to
open
the
cryptex.
Langdon
read
the
verse
slowly.
An
ancient
word
of
wisdom
frees
this
scroll
and
helps
us
keep
her
scatter'
d
family
whole,
headstone
praised
by
templars
is
the
key
and
atbash
will
reveal
the
truth
to
thee.
a
Before
Langdon
could
even
ponder
what
ancient
password
the
verse
was
trying
to
reveal,
he
felt
something
far
more
fundamental
resonate
within
him
the
meter
of
the
poem.
Iambic
pentameter.
Langdon
had
come
across
this
meter
often
over
the
years
while
researching
secret
societies
across
Europe,
including
just
last
year
in
the
Vatican
Secret
Archives.
For
centuries,
iambic
pentameter
had
been
a
preferred
poetic
meter
of
outspoken
literati
across
the
globe,
from
the
ancient
Greek
writer
Archilochus
to
Shakespeare,
Milton,
Chaucer,
and
Voltaire
bold
souls
who
chose
to
write
their
social
commentaries
in
a
meter
that
many
of
the
day
believed
had
mystical
properties.
The
roots
of
iambic
pentameter
were
deeply
pagan.
Iambs.
Two
syllables
with
opposite
emphasis.
Stressed
and
unstressed.
Yin
yang.
A
balanced
pair.
Arranged
in
strings
of
five.
Pentameter.
Five
for
the
pentacle
of
Venus
and
the
sacred
feminine.
"It's
pentameter!"
Teabing
blurted,
turning
to
Langdon.
"And
the
verse
is
in
English!
La
lingua
pural"
Langdon
nodded.
The
Priory,
like
many
European
secret
societies
at
odds
with
the
Church,
had
considered
English
the
only
European
pure
language
for
centuries.
Unlike
French,
Spanish,
and
Italian,
which
were
rooted
in
Latin
the
tongue
of
the
Vatican
English
was
linguistically
removed
from
Rome's
propaganda
machine,
and
therefore
became
a
sacred,
secret
tongue
for
those
brotherhoods
educated
enough
to
learn
it.
"This
poem,"
Teabing
gushed,
"references
not
only
the
Grail,
but
the
Knights
Templar
and
the
scattered
family
of
Mary
Magdalene!
What
more
could
we
ask
for?"
"The
password,"
Sophie
said,
looking
again
at
the
poem.
"It
sounds
like
we
need
some
kind
of
ancient
word
of
wisdom?"
"Abracadabra?"
Teabing
ventured,
his
eyes
twinkling.
A
word
of
five
letters,
Langdon
thought,
pondering
the
staggering
number
of
