grandfather
asleep
at
this
hour
and
was
excited
to
see
the
house
twinkling
with
lights.
Her
delight
turned
to
surprise,
however,
when
she
arrived
to
find
the
driveway
filled
with
parked
cars
Mercedeses,
BMWs,
Audis,
and
a
Rolls
Royce.
Sophie
stared
a
moment
and
then
burst
out
laughing.
My
grand
pere,
the
famous
recluse!
Jacques
Sauniere,
it
seemed,
was
far
less
reclusive
than
he
liked
to
pretend.
Clearly
he
was
hosting
a
party
while
Sophie
was
away
at
school,
and
from
the
looks
of
the
automobiles,
some
of
Paris's
most
influential
people
were
in
attendance.
Eager
to
surprise
him,
she
hurried
to
the
front
door.
When
she
got
there,
though,
she
found
it
locked.
She
knocked.
Nobody
answered.
Puzzled,
she
walked
around
and
tried
the
back
door.
It
too
was
locked.
No
answer.
Confused,
she
stood
a
moment
and
listened.
The
only
sound
she
heard
was
the
cool
Normandy
air
letting
out
a
low
moan
as
it
swirled
through
the
valley.
No
music.
No
voices.
Nothing.
In
the
silence
of
the
woods,
Sophie
hurried
to
the
side
of
the
house
and
clambered
up
on
a
woodpile,
pressing
her
face
to
the
living
room
window.
What
she
saw
inside
made
no
sense
at
all.
"Nobody's
here!"
The
entire
first
floor
looked
deserted.
Where
are
all
the
people
?
Heart
racing,
Sophie
ran
to
the
woodshed
and
got
the
spare
key
her
grandfather
kept
hidden
under
the
kindling
box.
She
ran
to
the
front
door
and
let
herself
in.
As
she
stepped
into
the
deserted
foyer,
the
control
panel
for
the
security
system
started
blinking
red
a
warning
that
the
entrant
had
ten
seconds
to
type
the
proper
code
before
the
security
alarms
went
off.
He
has
the
alarm
on
during
a
party?
Sophie
quickly
typed
the
code
and
deactivated
the
system.
Entering,
she
found
the
entire
house
uninhabited.
Upstairs
too.
As
she
descended
again
to
the
deserted
living
room,
she
stood
a
moment
in
the
silence,
wondering
what
could
possibly
be
happening.
It
was
then
that
Sophie
heard
it.
Muffled
voices.
And
they
seemed
to
be
coming
from
underneath
her.
Sophie
could
not
imagine.
Crouching,
she
put
her
ear
to
the
floor
and
listened.
Yes,
the
sound
was
definitely
coming
from
below.
The
voices
seemed
to
be
singing,
or
chanting?
She
was
frightened.
Almost
more
eerie
than
the
sound
itself
was
the
realization
that
this
house
did
not
even
have
a
basement.
At
least
none
I've
ever
seen.
Turning
now
and
scanning
the
living
room,
Sophie's
eyes
fell
to
the
only
object
in
the
entire
house
that
seemed
out
of
place
her
grandfather's
favorite
antique,
a
sprawling
Aubusson
tapestry.
It
usually
hung
on
the
east
wall
beside
the
fireplace,
but
tonight
it
had
been
pulled
aside
on
its
brass
rod,
exposing
the
wall
behind
it.
Walking
toward
the
bare
wooden
wall,
Sophie
sensed
the
chanting
getting
louder.
Hesitant,
she
leaned
her
ear
against
the
wood.
The
voices
were
clearer
now.
People
were
definitely
chanting
intoning
words
Sophie
could
not
discern.
The
space
behind
this
wall
is
hollow!
Feeling
around
the
edge
of
the
panels,
Sophie
found
a
recessed
fingerhold.
It
was
discreetly
crafted.
A
sliding
door.
Heart
pounding,
she
placed
her
finger
in
the
slot
and
pulled
it.
With
noiseless
precision,
the
heavy
wall
slid
sideways.
From
out
of
the
darkness
beyond,
the
voices
echoed
up.
Sophie
slipped
through
the
door
and
found
herself
on
a
rough
hewn
stone
staircase
that
spiraled
downward.
She'd
been
coming
to
this
house
since
she
was
a
child
and
yet
had
no
idea
this
staircase
even
existed!
As
she
descended,
the
air
grew
cooler.
The
voices
clearer.
She
heard
men
and
women
now.
Her
line
of
sight
was
limited
by
the
spiral
of
the
staircase,
but
the
last
step
was
now
rounding
into
view.
Beyond
it,
she
could
see
a
small
patch
of
the
basement
floor
stone,
illuminated
by
the
flickering
orange
blaze
of
firelight.
Holding
her
breath,
Sophie
inched
down
another
few
steps
and
crouched
down
to
look.
It
took
her
several
seconds
to
process
what
she
was
seeing.
The
room
was
a
grotto
a
coarse
chamber
that
appeared
to
have
been
hollowed
from
the
granite
of
the
hillside.
The
only
light
came
from
torches
on
the
walls.
In
the
glow
of
the
flames,
thirty
or
so
people
stood
in
a
circle
in
the
center
of
the
room.
I'm
dreaming,
Sophie
told
herself.
A
dream.
What
else
could
this
be?
Everyone
in
the
room
was
wearing
a
mask.
The
women
were
dressed
in
white
gossamer
gowns
and
golden
shoes.
Their
masks
were
white,
and
in
their
hands
they
carried
golden
orbs.
The
men
wore
long
black
tunics,
and
their
masks
were
black.
They
looked
like
pieces
in
a
giant
chess
set.
Everyone
in
the
circle
rocked
back
and
forth
and
chanted
in
reverence
to
something
on
the
floor
before
them
something
Sophie
could
not
see.
The
chanting
grew
steady
again.
Accelerating.
Thundering
now.
Faster.
The
participants
took
a
step
inward
and
knelt.
In
that
instant,
Sophie
could
finally
see
what
they
all
were
witnessing.
Even
as
she
staggered
back
in
horror,
she
felt
the
image
searing
itself
into
her
memory
forever.
Overtaken
by
nausea,
Sophie
spun,
clutching
at
the
stone
walls
as
she
clambered
back
up
the
stairs.
Pulling
the
door
closed,
she
fled
the
deserted
house,
and
drove
in
a
tearful
stupor
back
to
Paris.
That
night,
with
her
life
shattered
by
disillusionment
and
betrayal,
she
packed
her
belongings
and
left
her
home.
On
the
dining
room
table,
she
left
a
note.
I
WAS
THERE.
DON'T
TRY
TO
FIND
ME.
Beside
the
note,
she
laid
the
old
spare
key
from
the
chateau's
woodshed.
"Sophie!
Langdon's
voice
intruded.
"Stop!
Stop!"
Emerging
from
the
memory,
Sophie
slammed
on
the
brakes,
skidding
to
a
halt.
"What?
What
happened?
!
Langdon
pointed
down
the
long
street
before
them.
When
she
saw
it,
Sophie's
blood
went
cold.
A
hundred
yards
ahead,
the
intersection
was
blocked
by
a
couple
of
DCPJ
police
cars,
parked
askew,
their
purpose
obvious.
They've
