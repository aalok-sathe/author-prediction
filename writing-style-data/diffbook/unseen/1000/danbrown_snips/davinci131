on
the
wet
grass,
he
could
feel
a
warm
stream
of
blood
flowing
from
the
bullet
wound
below
his
ribs.
Still,
he
stared
straight
ahead.
The
fog
made
it
look
like
heaven
here.
Raising
his
bloody
hands
to
pray,
he
watched
the
raindrops
caress
his
fingers,
turning
them
white
again.
As
the
droplets
fell
harder
across
his
back
and
shoulders,
he
could
feel
his
body
disappearing
bit
by
bit
into
the
mist.
am
a
ghost.
A
breeze
rustled
past
him,
carrying
the
damp,
earthy
scent
of
new
life.
With
every
living
cell
in
his
broken
body,
Silas
prayed.
He
prayed
for
forgiveness.
He
prayed
for
mercy.
And,
above
all,
he
prayed
for
his
mentor
Bishop
Aringarosa
that
the
Lord
would
not
take
him
before
his
time.
He
has
so
much
work
left
to
do.
The
fog
was
swirling
around
him
now,
and
Silas
felt
so
light
that
he
was
sure
the
wisps
would
carry
him
away.
Closing
his
eyes,
he
said
a
final
prayer.
From
somewhere
in
the
mist,
the
voice
of
Manuel
Aringarosa
whispered
to
him.
Our
Lord
is
a
good
and
merciful
God.
Silas's
pain
at
last
began
to
fade,
and
he
knew
the
bishop
was
right.
It
was
late
afternoon
when
the
London
sun
broke
through
and
the
city
began
to
dry.
Bezu
Fache
felt
weary
as
he
emerged
from
the
interrogation
room
and
hailed
a
cab.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
had
vociferously
proclaimed
his
innocence,
and
yet
from
his
incoherent
rantings
about
the
Holy
Grail,
secret
documents,
and
mysterious
brotherhoods,
Fache
suspected
the
wily
historian
was
setting
the
stage
for
his
lawyers
to
plead
an
insanity
defense.
Sure,
Fache
thought.
Insane.
Teabing
had
displayed
ingenious
precision
in
formulating
a
plan
that
protected
his
innocence
at
every
turn.
He
had
exploited
both
the
Vatican
and
Opus
Dei,
two
groups
that
turned
out
to
be
completely
innocent.
His
dirty
work
had
been
carried
out
unknowingly
by
a
fanatical
monk
and
a
desperate
bishop.
More
clever
still,
Teabing
had
situated
his
electronic
listening
post
in
the
one
place
a
man
with
polio
could
not
possibly
reach.
The
actual
surveillance
had
been
carried
out
by
his
manservant,
Remy
the
lone
person
privy
to
Teabing's
true
identity
now
conveniently
dead
of
an
allergic
reaction.
Hardly
the
handiwork
of
someone
lacking
mental
faculties,
Fache
thought.
The
information
coming
from
Collet
out
of
Chateau
Villette
suggested
that
Teabing's
cunning
ran
so
deep
that
Fache
himself
might
even
learn
from
it.
To
successfully
hide
bugs
in
some
of
Paris's
most
powerful
offices,
the
British
historian
had
turned
to
the
Greeks.
Trojan
horses.
Some
of
Teabing's
intended
targets
received
lavish
gifts
of
artwork,
others
unwittingly
bid
at
auctions
in
which
Teabing
had
placed
specific
lots.
In
Sauniere's
case,
the
curator
had
received
a
dinner
invitation
to
Chateau
Villette
to
discuss
the
possibility
of
Teabing's
funding
a
new
Da
Vinci
Wing
at
the
Louvre.
Sauniere's
invitation
had
contained
an
innocuous
postscript
expressing
fascination
with
a
robotic
knight
that
Sauniere
was
rumored
to
have
built.
Bring
him
to
dinner,
Teabing
had
suggested.
Sauniere
apparently
had
done
just
that
and
left
the
knight
unattended
long
enough
for
Remy
Legaludec
to
make
one
inconspicuous
addition.
Now,
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
cab,
Fache
closed
his
eyes.
One
more
thing
to
attend
to
before
I
return
to
Paris.
The
St.
Mary's
Hospital
recovery
room
was
sunny.
"You've
impressed
us
all,"
the
nurse
said,
smiling
down
at
him.
"Nothing
short
of
miraculous."
Bishop
Aringarosa
gave
a
weak
smile.
"I
have
always
been
blessed."
The
nurse
finished
puttering,
leaving
the
bishop
alone.
The
sunlight
felt
welcome
and
warm
on
his
face.
Last
night
had
been
the
darkest
night
of
his
life.
Despondently,
he
thought
of
Silas,
whose
body
had
been
found
in
the
park.
Please
forgive
me,
my
son.
Aringarosa
had
longed
for
Silas
to
be
part
of
his
glorious
plan.
Last
night,
however,
Aringarosa
had
received
a
call
from
Bezu
Fache,
questioning
the
bishop
about
his
apparent
connection
to
a
nun
who
had
been
murdered
in
Saint
Sulpice.
Aringarosa
realized
the
evening
had
taken
a
horrifying
turn.
News
of
the
four
additional
murders
transformed
his
horror
to
anguish.
Silas,
what
have
you
done!
Unable
to
reach
the
Teacher,
the
bishop
knew
he
had
been
cut
loose.
Used.
The
only
way
to
stop
the
horrific
chain
of
events
he
had
helped
put
in
motion
was
to
confess
everything
to
Fache,
and
from
that
moment
on,
Aringarosa
and
Fache
had
been
racing
to
catch
up
with
Silas
before
the
Teacher
persuaded
him
to
kill
again.
Feeling
bone
weary,
Aringarosa
closed
his
eyes
and
listened
to
the
television
coverage
of
the
arrest
of
a
prominent
British
knight,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing.
The
Teacher
laid
bare
for
all
to
see.
Teabing
had
caught
wind
of
the
Vatican's
plans
to
disassociate
itself
from
Opus
Dei.
He
had
chosen
Aringarosa
as
the
perfect
pawn
in
his
plan.
After
all,
who
more
likely
to
leap
blindly
after
the
Holy
Grail
than
a
man
like
myself
with
everything
to
lose?
The
Grail
would
have
brought
enormous
power
to
anyone
who
possessed
it.
Leigh
Teabing
had
protected
his
identity
shrewdly
feigning
a
French
accent
and
a
pious
heart,
and
demanding
as
payment
the
one
thing
he
did
not
need
money.
Aringarosa
had
been
far
too
eager
to
be
suspicious.
The
price
tag
of
twenty
million
euro
was
paltry
when
compared
with
the
prize
of
obtaining
the
Grail,
and
with
the
Vatican's
separation
payment
to
Opus
Dei,
the
finances
had
worked
nicely.
The
blind
see
what
they
want
to
see.
Teabing's
ultimate
insult,
of
course,
had
been
to
demand
payment
in
Vatican
bonds,
such
that
if
anything
went
wrong,
the
investigation
would
lead
to
Rome.
"I
am
glad
to
see
you're
well,
My
Lord."
Aringarosa
recognized
the
gruff
voice
in
the
doorway,
but
the
face
was
unexpected
stern,
powerful
features,
slicked
back
hair,
and
a
broad
neck
that
strained
against
his
dark
suit.
"Captain
Fache?"
Aringarosa
asked.
The
compassion
and
concern
the
captain
had
shown
for
Aringarosa's
plight
last
night
had
conjured
