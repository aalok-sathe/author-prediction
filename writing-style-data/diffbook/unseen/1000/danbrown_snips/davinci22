of
his
own
volition.
Still,
it
had
been
almost
ten
minutes.
Too
long.
"Any
chance
Langdon
is
onto
us?"
Fache
asked.
Collet
shook
his
head.
"We're
still
seeing
small
movements
inside
the
men's
room,
so
the
GPS
dot
is
obviously
still
on
him.
Perhaps
he
feels
ill?
If
he
had
found
the
dot,
he
would
have
removed
it
and
tried
to
run.
Fache
checked
his
watch.
"Fine."
Still
Fache
seemed
preoccupied.
All
evening,
Collet
had
sensed
an
atypical
intensity
in
his
captain.
Usually
detached
and
cool
under
pressure,
Fache
tonight
seemed
emotionally
engaged,
as
if
this
were
somehow
a
personal
matter
for
him.
Not
surprising,
Collet
thought.
Fache
needs
this
arrest
desperately.
Recently
the
Board
of
Ministers
and
the
media
had
become
more
openly
critical
of
Fache's
aggressive
tactics,
his
clashes
with
powerful
foreign
embassies,
and
his
gross
overbudgeting
on
new
technologies.
Tonight,
a
high
tech,
high
profile
arrest
of
an
American
would
go
a
long
way
to
silence
Fache's
critics,
helping
him
secure
the
job
a
few
more
years
until
he
could
retire
with
the
lucrative
pension.
God
knows
he
needs
the
pension,
Collet
thought.
Fache's
zeal
for
technology
had
hurt
him
both
professionally
and
personally.
Fache
was
rumored
to
have
invested
his
entire
savings
in
the
technology
craze
a
few
years
back
and
lost
his
shirt.
And
Fache
is
a
man
who
wears
only
the
finest
shirts.
Tonight,
there
was
still
plenty
of
time.
Sophie
Neveu's
odd
interruption,
though
unfortunate,
had
been
only
a
minor
wrinkle.
She
was
gone
now,
and
Fache
still
had
cards
to
play.
He
had
yet
to
inform
Langdon
that
his
name
had
been
scrawled
on
the
floor
by
the
victim.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
The
American's
reaction
to
that
little
bit
of
evidence
would
be
telling
indeed.
"Captain?"
one
of
the
DCPJ
agents
now
called
from
across
the
office.
"I
think
you
better
take
this
call."
He
was
holding
out
a
telephone
receiver,
looking
concerned.
"Who
is
it?"
Fache
said.
The
agent
frowned.
"It's
the
director
of
our
Cryptology
Department."
"And?"
"It's
about
Sophie
Neveu,
sir.
Something
is
not
quite
right."
It
was
time.
Silas
felt
strong
as
he
stepped
from
the
black
Audi,
the
nighttime
breeze
rustling
his
loose
fitting
robe.
The
winds
of
change
are
in
the
air.
He
knew
the
task
before
him
would
require
more
finesse
than
force,
and
he
left
his
handgun
in
the
car.
The
thirteen
round
Heckler
Koch
USP
40
had
been
provided
by
the
Teacher.
A
weapon
of
death
has
no
place
in
a
house
of
God.
The
plaza
before
the
great
church
was
deserted
at
this
hour,
the
only
visible
souls
on
the
far
side
of
Place
Saint
Sulpice
a
couple
of
teenage
hookers
showing
their
wares
to
the
late
night
tourist
traffic.
Their
nubile
bodies
sent
a
familiar
longing
to
Silas's
loins.
His
thigh
flexed
instinctively,
causing
the
barbed
cilice
belt
to
cut
painfully
into
his
flesh.
The
lust
evaporated
instantly.
For
ten
years
now,
Silas
had
faithfully
denied
himself
all
sexual
indulgence,
even
self
administered.
It
was
The
Way.
He
knew
he
had
sacrificed
much
to
follow
Opus
Dei,
but
he
had
received
much
more
in
return.
A
vow
of
celibacy
and
the
relinquishment
of
all
personal
assets
hardly
seemed
a
sacrifice.
Considering
the
poverty
from
which
he
had
come
and
the
sexual
horrors
he
had
endured
in
prison,
celibacy
was
a
welcome
change.
Now,
having
returned
to
France
for
the
first
time
since
being
arrested
and
shipped
to
prison
in
Andorra,
Silas
could
feel
his
homeland
testing
him,
dragging
violent
memories
from
his
redeemed
soul.
You
have
been
reborn,
he
reminded
himself.
His
service
to
God
today
had
required
the
sin
of
murder,
and
it
was
a
sacrifice
Silas
knew
he
would
have
to
hold
silently
in
his
heart
for
all
eternity.
The
measure
of
your
faith
is
the
measure
of
the
pain
you
can
endure,
the
Teacher
had
told
him.
Silas
was
no
stranger
to
pain
and
felt
eager
to
prove
himself
to
the
Teacher,
the
one
who
had
assured
him
his
actions
were
ordained
by
a
higher
power.
"Hago
la
obra
de
Dios,
"
Silas
whispered,
moving
now
toward
the
church
entrance.
Pausing
in
the
shadow
of
the
massive
doorway,
he
took
a
deep
breath.
It
was
not
until
this
instant
that
he
truly
realized
what
he
was
about
to
do,
and
what
awaited
him
inside.
The
keystone.
It
will
lead
us
to
our
final
goal.
He
raised
his
ghost
white
fist
and
banged
three
times
on
the
door.
Moments
later,
the
bolts
of
the
enormous
wooden
portal
began
to
move.
Sophie
wondered
how
long
it
would
take
Fache
to
figure
out
she
had
not
left
the
building.
Seeing
that
Langdon
was
clearly
overwhelmed,
Sophie
questioned
whether
she
had
done
the
right
thing
by
cornering
him
here
in
the
men's
room.
What
else
was
I
supposed
to
do
?
She
pictured
her
grandfather's
body,
naked
and
spread
eagle
on
the
floor.
There
was
a
time
when
he
had
meant
the
world
to
her,
yet
tonight,
Sophie
was
surprised
to
feel
almost
no
sadness
for
the
man.
Jacques
Sauniere
was
a
stranger
to
her
now.
Their
relationship
had
evaporated
in
a
single
instant
one
March
night
when
she
was
twenty
two.
Ten
years
ago.
Sophie
had
come
home
a
few
days
early
from
graduate
university
in
England
and
mistakenly
witnessed
her
grandfather
engaged
in
something
Sophie
was
obviously
not
supposed
to
see.
It
was
an
image
she
barely
could
believe
to
this
day.
If
I
hadn't
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
Too
ashamed
and
stunned
to
endure
her
grandfather's
pained
attempts
to
explain,
Sophie
immediately
moved
out
on
her
own,
taking
money
she
had
saved,
and
getting
a
small
flat
with
some
roommates.
She
vowed
never
to
speak
to
anyone
about
what
she
had
seen.
Her
grandfather
tried
desperately
to
reach
her,
sending
cards
and
letters,
begging
Sophie
to
meet
him
so
he
could
explain.
Explain
how!
?
Sophie
never
responded
except
once
to
forbid
him
ever
to
call
