sfumato
style,
in
which
forms
appear
to
evaporate
into
one
another.
Since
taking
up
residence
in
the
Louvre,
the
Mona
Lisa
or
La
Jaconde
as
they
call
her
in
France
had
been
stolen
twice,
most
recently
in
1911,
when
she
disappeared
from
the
Louvre's
"satte
impenetrable"
Le
Salon
Carre.
Parisians
wept
in
the
streets
and
wrote
newspaper
articles
begging
the
thieves
for
the
painting's
return.
Two
years
later,
the
Mona
Lisa
was
discovered
hidden
in
the
false
bottom
of
a
trunk
in
a
Florence
hotel
room.
Langdon,
now
having
made
it
clear
to
Sophie
that
he
had
no
intention
of
leaving,
moved
with
her
across
the
Salle
des
Etats.
The
Mona
Lisa
was
still
twenty
yards
ahead
when
Sophie
turned
on
the
black
light,
and
the
bluish
crescent
of
penlight
fanned
out
on
the
floor
in
front
of
them.
She
swung
the
beam
back
and
forth
across
the
floor
like
a
minesweeper,
searching
for
any
hint
of
luminescent
ink.
Walking
beside
her,
Langdon
was
already
feeling
the
tingle
of
anticipation
that
accompanied
his
face
to
face
reunions
with
great
works
of
art.
He
strained
to
see
beyond
the
cocoon
of
purplish
light
emanating
from
the
black
light
in
Sophie's
hand.
To
the
left,
the
room's
octagonal
viewing
divan
emerged,
looking
like
a
dark
island
on
the
empty
sea
of
parquet.
Langdon
could
now
begin
to
see
the
panel
of
dark
glass
on
the
wall.
Behind
it,
he
knew,
in
the
confines
of
her
own
private
cell,
hung
the
most
celebrated
painting
in
the
world.
The
Mona
Lisa
's
status
as
the
most
famous
piece
of
art
in
the
world,
Langdon
knew,
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
enigmatic
smile.
Nor
was
it
due
to
the
mysterious
interpretations
attributed
her
by
many
art
historians
and
conspiracy
buffs.
Quite
simply,
the
Mona
Lisa
was
famous
because
Leonardo
da
Vinci
claimed
she
was
his
finest
accomplishment.
He
carried
the
painting
with
him
whenever
he
traveled
and,
if
asked
why,
would
reply
that
he
found
it
hard
to
part
with
his
most
sublime
expression
of
female
beauty.
Even
so,
many
art
historians
suspected
Da
Vinci's
reverence
for
the
Mona
Lisa
had
nothing
to
do
with
its
artistic
mastery.
In
actuality,
the
painting
was
a
surprisingly
ordinary
sfumato
portrait.
Da
Vinci's
veneration
for
this
work,
many
claimed,
stemmed
from
something
far
deeper:
a
hidden
message
in
the
layers
of
paint.
The
Mona
Lisa
was,
in
fact,
one
of
the
world's
most
documented
inside
jokes.
The
painting's
well
documented
collage
of
double
entendres
and
playful
allusions
had
been
revealed
in
most
art
history
tomes,
and
yet,
incredibly,
the
public
at
large
still
considered
her
smile
a
great
mystery.
No
mystery
at
all,
Langdon
thought,
moving
forward
and
watching
as
the
faint
outline
of
the
painting
began
to
take
shape.
No
mystery
at
all.
Most
recently
Langdon
had
shared
the
Mona
Lisa
's
secret
with
a
rather
unlikely
group
a
dozen
inmates
at
the
Essex
County
Penitentiary.
Langdon's
jail
seminar
was
part
of
a
Harvard
outreach
program
attempting
to
bring
education
into
the
prison
system
Culture
for
Convicts,
as
Langdon's
colleagues
liked
to
call
it.
Standing
at
an
overhead
projector
in
a
darkened
penitentiary
library,
Langdon
had
shared
the
Mona
Lisa's
secret
with
the
prisoners
attending
class,
men
whom
he
found
surprisingly
engaged
rough,
but
sharp.
"You
may
notice,"
Langdon
told
them,
walking
up
to
the
projected
image
of
the
Mona
Lisa
on
the
library
wall,
"that
the
background
behind
her
face
is
uneven."
Langdon
motioned
to
the
glaring
discrepancy.
"Da
Vinci
painted
the
horizon
line
on
the
left
significantly
lower
than
the
right."
"He
screwed
it
up?"
one
of
the
inmates
asked.
Langdon
chuckled.
"No.
Da
Vinci
didn't
do
that
too
often.
Actually,
this
is
a
little
trick
Da
Vinci
played.
By
lowering
the
countryside
on
the
left,
Da
Vinci
made
Mona
Lisa
look
much
larger
from
the
left
side
than
from
the
right
side.
A
little
Da
Vinci
inside
joke.
Historically,
the
concepts
of
male
and
female
have
assigned
sides
left
is
female,
and
right
is
male.
Because
Da
Vinci
was
a
big
fan
of
feminine
principles,
he
made
Mona
Lisa
look
more
majestic
from
the
left
than
the
right."
"I
heard
he
was
a
fag,"
said
a
small
man
with
a
goatee.
Langdon
winced.
"Historians
don't
generally
put
it
quite
that
way,
but
yes,
Da
Vinci
was
a
homosexual."
"Is
that
why
he
was
into
that
whole
feminine
thing?"
"Actually,
Da
Vinci
was
in
tune
with
the
balance
between
male
and
female.
He
believed
that
a
human
soul
could
not
be
enlightened
unless
it
had
both
male
and
female
elements."
"You
mean
like
chicks
with
dicks?"
someone
called.
This
elicited
a
hearty
round
of
laughs.
Langdon
considered
offering
an
etymological
sidebar
about
the
word
hermaphrodite
and
its
ties
to
Hermes
and
Aphrodite,
but
something
told
him
it
would
be
lost
on
this
crowd.
"Hey,
Mr.
Langford,"
a
muscle
bound
man
said.
"Is
it
true
that
the
Mona
Lisa
is
a
picture
of
Da
Vinci
in
drag?
I
heard
that
was
true."
"It's
quite
possible,"
Langdon
said.
"Da
Vinci
was
a
prankster,
and
computerized
analysis
of
the
Mona
Lisa
and
Da
Vinci's
self
portraits
confirm
some
startling
points
of
congruency
in
their
faces.
Whatever
Da
Vinci
was
up
to,"
Langdon
said,
"his
Mona
Lisa
is
neither
male
nor
female.
It
carries
a
subtle
message
of
androgyny.
It
is
a
fusing
of
both."
"You
sure
that's
not
just
some
Harvard
bullshit
way
of
saying
Mona
Lisa
is
one
ugly
chick."
Now
Langdon
laughed.
"You
may
be
right.
But
actually
Da
Vinci
left
a
big
clue
that
the
painting
was
supposed
to
be
androgynous.
Has
anyone
here
ever
heard
of
an
Egyptian
god
named
Anion?"
"Hell
yes!"
the
big
guy
said.
"God
of
masculine
fertility!"
Langdon
was
stunned.
"It
says
so
on
every
box
of
Amon
condoms."
The
muscular
man
gave
a
wide
grin.
"It's
got
a
guy
with
a
ram's
head
on
the
front
and
says
he's
the
Egyptian
god
of
fertility."
Langdon
was
not
familiar
