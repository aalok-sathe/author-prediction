ancient
words
that
might
be
considered
words
of
wisdom
selections
from
mystic
chants,
astrological
prophecies,
secret
society
inductions,
Wicca
incantations,
Egyptian
magic
spells,
pagan
mantras
the
list
was
endless.
"The
password,"
Sophie
said,
"appears
to
have
something
to
do
with
the
Templars."
She
read
the
text
aloud.
"
'A
headstone
praised
by
Templars
is
the
key.'
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
"you're
the
Templar
specialist.
Any
ideas?"
Teabing
was
silent
for
several
seconds
and
then
sighed.
"Well,
a
headstone
is
obviously
a
grave
marker
of
some
sort.
It's
possible
the
poem
is
referencing
a
gravestone
the
Templars
praised
at
the
tomb
of
Magdalene,
but
that
doesn't
help
us
much
because
we
have
no
idea
where
her
tomb
is."
"The
last
line,"
Sophie
said,
"says
that
Atbash
will
reveal
the
truth.
I've
heard
that
word.
Atbash."
"I'm
not
surprised,"
Langdon
replied.
"You
probably
heard
it
in
Cryptology
101.
The
Atbash
Cipher
is
one
of
the
oldest
codes
known
to
man."
Of
course!
Sophie
thought.
The
famous
Hebrew
encoding
system.
The
Atbash
Cipher
had
indeed
been
part
of
Sophie's
early
cryptology
training.
The
cipher
dated
back
to
500
B.C.
and
was
now
used
as
a
classroom
example
of
a
basic
rotational
substitution
scheme.
A
common
form
of
Jewish
cryptogram,
the
Atbash
Cipher
was
a
simple
substitution
code
based
on
the
twenty
two
letter
Hebrew
alphabet.
In
Atbash,
the
first
letter
was
substituted
by
the
last
letter,
the
second
letter
by
the
next
to
last
letter,
and
so
on.
"Atbash
is
sublimely
appropriate,"
Teabing
said.
"Text
encrypted
with
Atbash
is
found
throughout
the
Kabbala,
the
Dead
Sea
Scrolls,
and
even
the
Old
Testament.
Jewish
scholars
and
mystics
are
still
finding
hidden
meanings
using
Atbash.
The
Priory
certainly
would
include
the
Atbash
Cipher
as
part
of
their
teachings."
"The
only
problem,"
Langdon
said,
"is
that
we
don't
have
anything
on
which
to
apply
the
cipher."
Teabing
sighed.
"There
must
be
a
code
word
on
the
headstone.
We
must
find
this
headstone
praised
by
Templars."
Sophie
sensed
from
the
grim
look
on
Langdon's
face
that
finding
the
Templar
headstone
would
be
no
small
feat.
Atbash
is
the
key,
Sophie
thought.
But
we
don
't
have
a
door.
It
was
three
minutes
later
that
Teabing
heaved
a
frustrated
sigh
and
shook
his
head.
"My
friends,
I'm
stymied.
Let
me
ponder
this
while
I
get
us
some
nibblies
and
check
on
Remy
and
our
guest."
He
stood
up
and
headed
for
the
back
of
the
plane.
Sophie
felt
tired
as
she
watched
him
go.
Outside
the
window,
the
blackness
of
the
predawn
was
absolute.
Sophie
felt
as
if
she
were
being
hurtled
through
space
with
no
idea
where
she
would
land.
Having
grown
up
solving
her
grandfather's
riddles,
she
had
the
uneasy
sense
right
now
that
this
poem
before
them
contained
information
they
still
had
not
seen.
There
is
more
there,
she
told
herself.
Ingeniously
hidden
but
present
nonetheless.
Also
plaguing
her
thoughts
was
a
fear
that
what
they
eventually
found
inside
this
cryptex
would
not
be
as
simple
as
"a
map
to
the
Holy
Grail."
Despite
Teabing's
and
Langdon's
confidence
that
the
truth
lay
just
within
the
marble
cylinder,
Sophie
had
solved
enough
of
her
grandfather's
treasure
hunts
to
know
that
Jacques
Sauniere
did
not
give
up
his
secrets
easily.
Bourget
Airfield's
night
shift
air
traffic
controller
had
been
dozing
before
a
blank
radar
screen
when
the
captain
of
the
Judicial
Police
practically
broke
down
his
door.
"Teabing's
jet,"
Bezu
Fache
blared,
marching
into
the
small
tower,
"where
did
it
go?"
The
controller's
initial
response
was
a
babbling,
lame
attempt
to
protect
the
privacy
of
their
British
client
one
of
the
airfield's
most
respected
customers.
It
failed
miserably.
"Okay,"
Fache
said,
"I
am
placing
you
under
arrest
for
permitting
a
private
plane
to
take
off
without
registering
a
flight
plan.
"
Fache
motioned
to
another
officer,
who
approached
with
handcuffs,
and
the
traffic
controller
felt
a
surge
of
terror.
He
thought
of
the
newspaper
articles
debating
whether
the
nation's
police
captain
was
a
hero
or
a
menace.
That
question
had
just
been
answered.
"Wait!"
the
controller
heard
himself
whimper
at
the
sight
of
the
handcuffs.
"I
can
tell
you
this
much.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
makes
frequent
trips
to
London
for
medical
treatments.
He
has
a
hangar
at
Biggin
Hill
Executive
Airport
in
Kent.
On
the
outskirts
of
London."
Fache
waved
off
the
man
with
the
cuffs.
"Is
Biggin
Hill
his
destination
tonight?"
"I
don't
know,"
the
controller
said
honestly.
"The
plane
left
on
its
usual
tack,
and
his
last
radar
contact
suggested
the
United
Kingdom.
Biggin
Hill
is
an
extremely
likely
guess."
"Did
he
have
others
onboard?"
"I
swear,
sir,
there
is
no
way
for
me
to
know
that.
Our
clients
can
drive
directly
to
their
hangars,
and
load
as
they
please.
Who
is
onboard
is
the
responsibility
of
the
customs
officials
at
the
receiving
airport."
Fache
checked
his
watch
and
gazed
out
at
the
scattering
of
jets
parked
in
front
of
the
terminal.
"If
they're
going
to
Biggin
Hill,
how
long
until
they
land?"
The
controller
fumbled
through
his
records.
"It's
a
short
flight.
His
plane
could
be
on
the
ground
by
around
six
thirty.
Fifteen
minutes
from
now."
Fache
frowned
and
turned
to
one
of
his
men.
"Get
a
transport
up
here.
I'm
going
to
London.
And
get
me
the
Kent
local
police.
Not
British
MI5.
1
want
this
quiet.
Kent
local.
Tell
them
I
want
Teabing's
plane
to
be
permitted
to
land.
Then
I
want
it
surrounded
on
the
tarmac.
Nobody
deplanes
until
I
get
there."
"You're
quiet,"
Langdon
said,
gazing
across
the
Hawker's
cabin
at
Sophie.
"Just
tired,"
she
replied.
"And
the
poem.
I
don't
know."
Langdon
was
feeling
the
same
way.
The
hum
of
the
engines
and
the
gentle
rocking
of
the
plane
were
hypnotic,
and
his
head
still
throbbed
where
he'd
been
hit
by
the
monk.
Teabing
was
still
in
the
back
of
the
plane,
and
Langdon
decided
to
take
advantage
of
the
moment
alone
with
Sophie
to
tell
her
something
that
