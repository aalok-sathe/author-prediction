are
obviously
a
man
of
great
culture
and
refinement.
I
would
imagine
you
are
a
man
of
honor,
as
well.
As
am
I.
That
said,
I
give
you
my
word
as
commanding
officer
of
the
Police
Judiciaire
that
your
box,
along
with
your
bank's
reputation,
are
in
the
safest
of
hands."
High
in
the
hayloft
at
Chateau
Villette,
Collet
stared
at
the
computer
monitor
in
amazement.
"This
system
is
eavesdropping
on
all
these
locations?"
"Yes,"
the
agent
said.
"It
looks
like
data
has
been
collected
for
over
a
year
now."
Collet
read
the
list
again,
speechless.
COLBERT
SOSTAQUE
Chairman
of
the
Conseil
Constitutionnel
JEAN
CHAFFEE
Curator,
Musee
du
Jeu
de
Paume
EDOUARD
DESROCHERS
Senior
Archivist,
Mitterrand
Library
JACQUES
SAUNIERE
Curator,
Musee

MICHEL
BRETON
Head
of
DAS
(French
Intelligence)
The
agent
pointed
to
the
screen.
"Number
four
is
of
obvious
concern."
Collet
nodded
blankly.
He
had
noticed
it
immediately.
Jacques
Sauniere
was
being
bugged.
He
looked
at
the
rest
of
the
list
again.
How
could
anyone
possibly
manage
to
bug
these
prominent
people?
"Have
you
heard
any
of
the
audio
files?"
"A
few.
Here's
one
of
the
most
recent."
The
agent
clicked
a
few
computer
keys.
The
speakers
crackled
to
life.
"Capitaine,
un
agent
du
Departement
de
Cryptographic
est
arrive.
Collet
could
not
believe
his
ears.
"That's
me!
That's
my
voice!"
He
recalled
sitting
at
Sauniere's
desk
and
radioing
Fache
in
the
Grand
Gallery
to
alert
him
of
Sophie
Neveu's
arrival.
The
agent
nodded.
"A
lot
of
our
Louvre
investigation
tonight
would
have
been
audible
if
someone
had
been
interested."
"Have
you
sent
anyone
in
to
sweep
for
the
bug?"
"No
need.
I
know
exactly
where
it
is."
The
agent
went
to
a
pile
of
old
notes
and
blueprints
on
the
worktable.
He
selected
a
page
and
handed
it
to
Collet.
"Look
familiar?"
Collet
was
amazed.
He
was
holding
a
photocopy
of
an
ancient
schematic
diagram,
which
depicted
a
rudimentary
machine.
He
was
unable
to
read
the
handwritten
Italian
labels,
and
yet
he
knew
what
he
was
looking
at.
A
model
for
a
fully
articulated
medieval
French
knight.
The
knight
sitting
on
Sauniere's
desk!
Collet's
eyes
moved
to
the
margins,
where
someone
had
scribbled
notes
on
the
photocopy
in
red
felt
tipped
marker.
The
notes
were
in
French
and
appeared
to
be
ideas
outlining
how
best
to
insert
a
listening
device
into
the
knight.
Silas
sat
in
the
passenger
seat
of
the
parked
Jaguar
limousine
near
the
Temple
Church.
His
hands
felt
damp
on
the
keystone
as
he
waited
for
Remy
to
finish
tying
and
gagging
Teabing
in
back
with
the
rope
they
had
found
in
the
trunk.
Finally,
Remy
climbed
out
of
the
rear
of
the
limo,
walked
around,
and
slid
into
the
driver's
seat
beside
Silas.
"Secure?"
Silas
asked.
Remy
chuckled,
shaking
off
the
rain
and
glancing
over
his
shoulder
through
the
open
partition
at
the
crumpled
form
of
Leigh
Teabing,
who
was
barely
visible
in
the
shadows
in
the
rear.
"He's
not
going
anywhere."
Silas
could
hear
Teabing's
muffled
cries
and
realized
Remy
had
used
some
of
the
old
duct
tape
to
gag
him.
"Ferme
ta
gueule!"
Remy
shouted
over
his
shoulder
at
Teabing.
Reaching
to
a
control
panel
on
the
elaborate
dash,
Remy
pressed
a
button.
An
opaque
partition
raised
behind
them,
sealing
off
the
back.
Teabing
disappeared,
and
his
voice
was
silenced.
Remy
glanced
at
Silas.
"I've
been
listening
to
his
miserable
whimpering
long
enough."
Minutes
later,
as
the
Jaguar
stretch
limo
powered
through
the
streets,
Silas's
cell
phone
rang.
The
Teacher.
He
answered
excitedly.
"Hello?"
"Silas,"
the
Teacher's
familiar
French
accent
said,
"I
am
relieved
to
hear
your
voice.
This
means
you
are
safe."
Silas
was
equally
comforted
to
hear
the
Teacher.
It
had
been
hours,
and
the
operation
had
veered
wildly
off
course.
Now,
at
last,
it
seemed
to
be
back
on
track.
"I
have
the
keystone."
"This
is
superb
news,"
the
Teacher
told
him.
"Is
Remy
with
you?"
Silas
was
surprised
to
hear
the
Teacher
use
Remy's
name.
"Yes.
Remy
freed
me."
"As
I
ordered
him
to
do.
I
am
only
sorry
you
had
to
endure
captivity
for
so
long."
"Physical
discomfort
has
no
meaning.
The
important
thing
is
that
the
keystone
is
ours."
"Yes.
I
need
it
delivered
to
me
at
once.
Time
is
of
the
essence."
Silas
was
eager
to
meet
the
Teacher
face
to
face
at
last.
"Yes,
sir,
I
would
be
honored."
"Silas,
I
would
like
Remy
to
bring
it
to
me."
Remy?
Silas
was
crestfallen.
After
everything
Silas
had
done
for
the
Teacher,
he
had
believed
he
would
be
the
one
to
hand
over
the
prize.
The
Teacher
favors
Remy?
"I
sense
your
disappointment,"
the
Teacher
said,
"which
tells
me
you
do
not
understand
my
meaning."
He
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper.
"You
must
believe
that
I
would
much
prefer
to
receive
the
keystone
from
you
a
man
of
God
rather
than
a
criminal
but
Remy
must
be
dealt
with.
He
disobeyed
my
orders
and
made
a
grave
mistake
that
has
put
our
entire
mission
at
risk.
Silas
felt
a
chill
and
glanced
over
at
Remy.
Kidnapping
Teabing
had
not
been
part
of
the
plan,
and
deciding
what
to
do
with
him
posed
a
new
problem.
"You
and
I
are
men
of
God,"
the
Teacher
whispered.
"We
cannot
be
deterred
from
our
goal."
There
was
an
ominous
pause
on
the
line.
"For
this
reason
alone,
I
will
ask
Remy
to
bring
me
the
keystone.
Do
you
understand?"
Silas
sensed
anger
in
the
Teacher's
voice
and
was
surprised
the
man
was
not
more
understanding.
Showing
his
face
could
not
be
avoided,
Silas
thought.
Remy
did
what
he
had
to
do.
He
saved
the
keystone.
"I
understand,"
Silas
managed.
"Good.
For
your
own
safety,
you
need
to
get
off
the
street
immediately.
The
police
will
be
looking
for
the
limousine
soon,
and
I
do
not
want
you
caught.
Opus
Dei
has
a
residence
in
London,
no?"
"Of
course."
"And
you
are
welcome
there?"
"As
a
brother."
"Then
