words
crackled
through
the
intercom
on
the
wall,
and
Sophie
jumped.
"If
you
could
join
me
in
the
kitchen
a
moment?"
Teabing
scowled
at
the
ill
timed
intrusion.
He
went
over
to
the
intercom
and
pressed
the
button.
"Remy,
as
you
know,
I
am
busy
with
my
guests.
If
we
need
anything
else
from
the
kitchen
tonight,
we
will
help
ourselves.
Thank
you
and
good
night."
"A
word
with
you
before
I
retire,
sir.
If
you
would."
Teabing
grunted
and
pressed
the
button.
"Make
it
quick,
Remy."
"It
is
a
household
matter,
sir,
hardly
fare
for
guests
to
endure."
Teabing
looked
incredulous.
"And
it
cannot
wait
until
morning?"
"No,
sir.
My
question
won't
take
a
minute."
Teabing
rolled
his
eyes
and
looked
at
Langdon
and
Sophie.
"Sometimes
I
wonder
who
is
serving
whom?"
He
pressed
the
button
again.
"I'll
be
right
there,
Remy.
Can
I
bring
you
anything
when
I
come?"
"Only
freedom
from
oppression,
sir."
"Remy,
you
realize
your
steak
au
poivre
is
the
only
reason
you
still
work
for
me."
"So
you
tell
me,
sir.
So
you
tell
me."
Princess
Sophie.
Sophie
felt
hollow
as
she
listened
to
the
clicking
of
Teabing's
crutches
fade
down
the
hallway.
Numb,
she
turned
and
faced
Langdon
in
the
deserted
ballroom.
He
was
already
shaking
his
head
as
if
reading
her
mind.
"No,
Sophie,"
he
whispered,
his
eyes
reassuring.
"The
same
thought
crossed
my
mind
when
I
realized
your
grandfather
was
in
the
Priory,
and
you
said
he
wanted
to
tell
you
a
secret
about
your
family.
But
it's
impossible."
Langdon
paused.
"Sauniere
is
not
a
Merovingian
name."
Sophie
wasn't
sure
whether
to
feel
relieved
or
disappointed.
Earlier,
Langdon
had
asked
an
unusual
passing
question
about
Sophie's
mother's
maiden
name.
Chauvel.
The
question
now
made
sense.
"And
Chauvel?"
she
asked,
anxious.
Again
he
shook
his
head.
"I'm
sorry.
I
know
that
would
have
answered
some
questions
for
you.
Only
two
direct
lines
of
Merovingians
remain.
Their
family
names
are
Plantard
and
Saint
Clair.
Both
families
live
in
hiding,
probably
protected
by
the
Priory."
Sophie
repeated
the
names
silently
in
her
mind
and
then
shook
her
head.
There
was
no
one
in
her
family
named
Plantard
or
Saint
Clair.
A
weary
undertow
was
pulling
at
her
now.
She
realized
she
was
no
closer
than
she
had
been
at
the
Louvre
to
understanding
what
truth
her
grandfather
had
wanted
to
reveal
to
her.
Sophie
wished
her
grandfather
had
never
mentioned
her
family
this
afternoon.
He
had
torn
open
old
wounds
that
felt
as
painful
now
as
ever.
They
are
dead,
Sophie.
They
are
not
coming
back.
She
thought
of
her
mother
singing
her
to
sleep
at
night,
of
her
father
giving
her
rides
on
his
shoulders,
and
of
her
grandmother
and
younger
brother
smiling
at
her
with
their
fervent
green
eyes.
All
that
was
stolen.
And
all
she
had
left
was
her
grandfather.
And
now
he
is
gone
too.
I
am
alone.
Sophie
turned
quietly
back
to
The
Last
Supper
and
gazed
at
Mary
Magdalene's
long
red
hair
and
quiet
eyes.
There
was
something
in
the
woman's
expression
that
echoed
the
loss
of
a
loved
one.
Sophie
could
feel
it
too.
"Robert?"
she
said
softly.
He
stepped
closer.
"I
know
Leigh
said
the
Grail
story
is
all
around
us,
but
tonight
is
the
first
time
I've
ever
heard
any
of
this."
Langdon
looked
as
if
he
wanted
to
put
a
comforting
hand
on
her
shoulder,
but
he
refrained.
"You've
heard
her
story
before,
Sophie.
Everyone
has.
We
just
don't
realize
it
when
we
hear
it."
"I
don't
understand."
"The
Grail
story
is
everywhere,
but
it
is
hidden.
When
the
Church
outlawed
speaking
of
the
shunned
Mary
Magdalene,
her
story
and
importance
had
to
be
passed
on
through
more
discreet
channels
channels
that
supported
metaphor
and
symbolism."
"Of
course.
The
arts."
Langdon
motioned
to
The
Last
Supper.
"A
perfect
example.
Some
of
today's
most
enduring
art,
literature,
and
music
secretly
tell
the
history
of
Mary
Magdalene
and
Jesus."
Langdon
quickly
told
her
about
works
by
Da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
Poussin,
Bernini,
Mozart,
and
Victor
Hugo
that
all
whispered
of
the
quest
to
restore
the
banished
sacred
feminine.
Enduring
legends
like
Sir
Gawain
and
the
Green
Knight,
King
Arthur,
and
Sleeping
Beauty
were
Grail
allegories.
Victor
Hugo's
Hunchback
of
Notre
Dame
and
Mozart's
Magic
Flute
were
filled
with
Masonic
symbolism
and
Grail
secrets.
"Once
you
open
your
eyes
to
the
Holy
Grail,"
Langdon
said,
"you
see
her
everywhere.
Paintings.
Music.
Books.
Even
in
cartoons,
theme
parks,
and
popular
movies."
Langdon
held
up
his
Mickey
Mouse
watch
and
told
her
that
Walt
Disney
had
made
it
his
quiet
life's
work
to
pass
on
the
Grail
story
to
future
generations.
Throughout
his
entire
life,
Disney
had
been
hailed
as
"the
Modern
Day
Leonardo
da
Vinci."
Both
men
were
generations
ahead
of
their
times,
uniquely
gifted
artists,
members
of
secret
societies,
and,
most
notably,
avid
pranksters.
Like
Leonardo,
Walt
Disney
loved
infusing
hidden
messages
and
symbolism
in
his
art.
For
the
trained
symbologist,
watching
an
early
Disney
movie
was
like
being
barraged
by
an
avalanche
of
allusion
and
metaphor.
Most
of
Disney's
hidden
messages
dealt
with
religion,
pagan
myth,
and
stories
of
the
subjugated
goddess.
It
was
no
mistake
that
Disney
retold
tales
like
Cinderella,
Sleeping
Beauty,
and
Snow
White
all
of
which
dealt
with
the
incarceration
of
the
sacred
feminine.
Nor
did
one
need
a
background
in
symbolism
to
understand
that
Snow
White
a
princess
who
fell
from
grace
after
partaking
of
a
poisoned
apple
was
a
clear
allusion
to
the
downfall
of
Eve
in
the
Garden
of
Eden.
Or
that
Sleeping
Beauty's
Princess
Aurora
code
named
"Rose"
and
hidden
deep
in
the
forest
to
protect
her
from
the
clutches
of
the
evil
witch
was
the
Grail
story
for
children.
Despite
its
corporate
image,
Disney
still
had
a
savvy,
playful
element
among
its
employees,
and
their
artists
still
amused
themselves
by
inserting
hidden
symbolism
in
Disney
products.
Langdon
would
never
forget
one
of
his
students
bringing
in
a
DVD
