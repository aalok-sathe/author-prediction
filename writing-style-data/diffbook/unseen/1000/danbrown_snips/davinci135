was
not
sure
what
to
do
now
that
they
had
arrived.
The
poem
made
reference
to
a
"blade
and
chalice,"
which
Langdon
saw
nowhere.
The
Holy
Grail
'neath
ancient
Roslin
waits.
The
blade
and
chalice
guarding
o'er
Her
gates.
Again
Langdon
sensed
there
remained
some
facet
of
this
mystery
yet
to
reveal
itself.
"I
hate
to
pry,"
the
docent
said,
eyeing
the
rosewood
box
in
Langdon's
hands.
"But
this
box
might
I
ask
where
you
got
it?"
Langdon
gave
a
weary
laugh.
"That's
an
exceptionally
long
story."
The
young
man
hesitated,
his
eyes
on
the
box
again.
"It's
the
strangest
thing
my
grandmother
has
a
box
exactly
like
that
a
jewelry
box.
Identical
polished
rosewood,
same
inlaid
rose,
even
the
hinges
look
the
same."
Langdon
knew
the
young
man
must
be
mistaken.
If
ever
a
box
had
been
one
of
a
kind,
it
was
this
one
the
box
custom
made
for
the
Priory
keystone.
"The
two
boxes
may
be
similar
but
The
side
door
closed
loudly,
drawing
both
of
their
gazes.
Sophie
had
exited
without
a
word
and
was
now
wandering
down
the
bluff
toward
a
fieldstone
house
nearby.
Langdon
stared
after
her.
Where
is
she
going?
She
had
been
acting
strangely
ever
since
they
entered
the
building.
He
turned
to
the
docent.
"Do
you
know
what
that
house
is?"
He
nodded,
also
looking
puzzled
that
Sophie
was
going
down
there.
"That's
the
chapel
rectory.
The
chapel
curator
lives
there.
She
also
happens
to
be
the
head
of
the
Rosslyn
Trust."
He
paused.
"And
my
grandmother."
"Your
grandmother
heads
the
Rosslyn
Trust?"
The
young
man
nodded.
"I
live
with
her
in
the
rectory
and
help
keep
up
the
chapel
and
give
tours."
He
shrugged.
"I've
lived
here
my
whole
life.
My
grandmother
raised
me
in
that
house."
Concerned
for
Sophie,
Langdon
moved
across
the
chapel
toward
the
door
to
call
out
to
her.
He
was
only
halfway
there
when
he
stopped
short.
Something
the
young
man
said
just
registered.
My
grandmother
raised
me.
Langdon
looked
out
at
Sophie
on
the
bluff,
then
down
at
the
rosewood
box
in
his
hand.
Impossible.
Slowly,
Langdon
turned
back
to
the
young
man.
"You
said
your
grandmother
has
a
box
like
this
one?"
"Almost
identical."
"Where
did
she
get
it?"
"My
grandfather
made
it
for
her.
He
died
when
I
was
a
baby,
but
my
grandmother
still
talks
about
him.
She
says
he
was
a
genius
with
his
hands.
He
made
all
kinds
of
things."
Langdon
glimpsed
an
unimaginable
web
of
connections
emerging.
"You
said
your
grandmother
raised
you.
Do
you
mind
my
asking
what
happened
to
your
parents?"
The
young
man
looked
surprised.
"They
died
when
I
was
young."
He
paused.
"The
same
day
as
my
grandfather."
Langdon's
heart
pounded.
"In
a
car
accident?"
The
docent
recoiled,
a
look
of
bewilderment
in
his
olive
green
eyes.
"Yes.
In
a
car
accident.
My
entire
family
died
that
day.
I
lost
my
grandfather,
my
parents,
and"
He
hesitated,
glancing
down
at
the
floor.
"And
your
sister,"
Langdon
said.
Out
on
the
bluff,
the
fieldstone
house
was
exactly
as
Sophie
remembered
it.
Night
was
falling
now,
and
the
house
exuded
a
warm
and
inviting
aura.
The
smell
of
bread
wafted
through
the
opened
screened
door,
and
a
golden
light
shone
in
the
windows.
As
Sophie
approached,
she
could
hear
the
quiet
sounds
of
sobbing
from
within.
Through
the
screened
door,
Sophie
saw
an
elderly
woman
in
the
hallway.
Her
back
was
to
the
door,
but
Sophie
could
see
she
was
crying.
The
woman
had
long,
luxuriant,
silver
hair
that
conjured
an
unexpected
wisp
of
memory.
Feeling
herself
drawn
closer,
Sophie
stepped
onto
the
porch
stairs.
The
woman
was
clutching
a
framed
photograph
of
a
man
and
touching
her
fingertips
to
his
face
with
loving
sadness.
It
was
a
face
Sophie
knew
well.
Grand
pere.
The
woman
had
obviously
heard
the
sad
news
of
his
death
last
night.
A
board
squeaked
beneath
Sophie's
feet,
and
the
woman
turned
slowly,
her
sad
eyes
finding
Sophie's.
Sophie
wanted
to
run,
but
she
stood
transfixed.
The
woman's
fervent
gaze
never
wavered
as
she
set
down
the
photo
and
approached
the
screened
door.
An
eternity
seemed
to
pass
as
the
two
women
stared
at
one
another
through
the
thin
mesh.
Then,
like
the
slowly
gathering
swell
of
an
ocean
wave,
the
woman's
visage
transformed
from
one
of
uncertainty
to
disbelief
to
hope
and
finally,
to
cresting
joy.
Throwing
open
the
door,
she
came
out,
reaching
with
soft
hands,
cradling
Sophie's
thunderstruck
face.
"Oh,
dear
child
look
at
you!"
Although
Sophie
did
not
recognize
her,
she
knew
who
this
woman
was.
She
tried
to
speak
but
found
she
could
not
even
breathe.
"Sophie,"
the
woman
sobbed,
kissing
her
forehead.
Sophie's
words
were
a
choked
whisper.
"But
Grand
pere
said
you
were"
"I
know."
The
woman
placed
her
tender
hands
on
Sophie's
shoulders
and
gazed
at
her
with
familiar
eyes.
"Your
grandfather
and
I
were
forced
to
say
so
many
things.
We
did
what
we
thought
was
right.
I'm
so
sorry.
It
was
for
your
own
safety,
princess."
Sophie
heard
her
final
word,
and
immediately
thought
of
her
grandfather,
who
had
called
her
princess
for
so
many
years.
The
sound
of
his
voice
seemed
to
echo
now
in
the
ancient
stones
of
Rosslyn,
settling
through
the
earth
and
reverberating
in
the
unknown
hollows
below.
The
woman
threw
her
arms
around
Sophie,
the
tears
flowing
faster.
"Your
grandfather
wanted
so
badly
to
tell
you
everything.
But
things
were
difficult
between
you
two.
He
tried
so
hard.
There's
so
much
to
explain.
So
very
much
to
explain."
She
kissed
Sophie's
forehead
once
again,
then
whispered
in
her
ear.
"No
more
secrets,
princess.
It's
time
you
learn
the
truth
about
our
family."
Sophie
and
her
grandmother
were
seated
on
the
porch
stairs
in
a
tearful
hug
when
the
young
docent
dashed
across
the
lawn,
his
eyes
shining
with
hope
and
disbelief.
"Sophie?"
Through
her
tears,
Sophie
nodded,
standing.
She
did
not
know
the
young
man's
face,
