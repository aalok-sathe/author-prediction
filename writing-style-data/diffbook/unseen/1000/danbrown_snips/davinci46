back
the
hearts
of
those
who
felt
the
demands
of
true
Catholicism
had
become
too
inconvenient
in
a
modern
world.
Aringarosa
had
been
using
all
of
his
political
sway
substantial
considering
the
size
of
the
Opus
Dei
constituency
and
their
bankroll
to
persuade
the
Pope
and
his
advisers
that
softening
the
Church's
laws
was
not
only
faithless
and
cowardly,
but
political
suicide.
He
reminded
them
that
previous
tempering
of
Church
law
the
Vatican
II
fiasco
had
left
a
devastating
legacy:
Church
attendance
was
now
lower
than
ever,
donations
were
drying
up,
and
there
were
not
even
enough
Catholic
priests
to
preside
over
their
churches.
People
need
structure
and
direction
from
the
Church,
Aringarosa
insisted,
not
coddling
and
indulgence!
On
that
night,
months
ago,
as
the
Fiat
had
left
the
airport,
Aringarosa
was
surprised
to
find
himself
heading
not
toward
Vatican
City
but
rather
eastward
up
a
sinuous
mountain
road.
"Where
are
we
going?"
he
had
demanded
of
his
driver.
"Alban
Hills,"
the
man
replied.
"Your
meeting
is
at
Castel
Gandolfo."
The
Pope
's
summer
residence
?
Aringarosa
had
never
been,
nor
had
he
ever
desired
to
see
it.
In
addition
to
being
the
Pope's
summer
vacation
home,
the
sixteenth
century
citadel
housed
the
Specula
Vaticana
the
Vatican
Observatory
one
of
the
most
advanced
astronomical
observatories
in
Europe.
Aringarosa
had
never
been
comfortable
with
the
Vatican's
historical
need
to
dabble
in
science.
What
was
the
rationale
for
fusing
science
and
faith?
Unbiased
science
could
not
possibly
be
performed
by
a
man
who
possessed
faith
in
God.
Nor
did
faith
have
any
need
for
physical
confirmation
of
its
beliefs.
Nonetheless,
there
it
is,
he
thought
as
Castel
Gandolfo
came
into
view,
rising
against
a
star
filled
November
sky.
From
the
access
road,
Gandolfo
resembled
a
great
stone
monster
pondering
a
suicidal
leap.
Perched
at
the
very
edge
of
a
cliff,
the
castle
leaned
out
over
the
cradle
of
Italian
civilization
the
valley
where
the
Curiazi
and
Orazi
clans
fought
long
before
the
founding
of
Rome.
Even
in
silhouette,
Gandolfo
was
a
sight
to
behold
an
impressive
example
of
tiered,
defensive
architecture,
echoing
the
potency
of
this
dramatic
cliffside
setting.
Sadly,
Aringarosa
now
saw,
the
Vatican
had
ruined
the
building
by
constructing
two
huge
aluminum
telescope
domes
atop
the
roof,
leaving
this
once
dignified
edifice
looking
like
a
proud
warrior
wearing
a
couple
of
party
hats.
When
Aringarosa
got
out
of
the
car,
a
young
Jesuit
priest
hurried
out
and
greeted
him.
"Bishop,
welcome.
I
am
Father
Mangano.
An
astronomer
here."
Good
for
you.
Aringarosa
grumbled
his
hello
and
followed
his
host
into
the
castle's
foyer
a
wide
open
space
whose
decor
was
a
graceless
blend
of
Renaissance
art
and
astronomy
images.
Following
his
escort
up
the
wide
travertine
marble
staircase,
Aringarosa
saw
signs
for
conference
centers,
science
lecture
halls,
and
tourist
information
services.
It
amazed
him
to
think
the
Vatican
was
failing
at
every
turn
to
provide
coherent,
stringent
guidelines
for
spiritual
growth
and
yet
somehow
still
found
time
to
give
astrophysics
lectures
to
tourists.
"Tell
me,"
Aringarosa
said
to
the
young
priest,
"when
did
the
tail
start
wagging
the
dog?"
The
priest
gave
him
an
odd
look.
"Sir?"
Aringarosa
waved
it
off,
deciding
not
to
launch
into
that
particular
offensive
again
this
evening.
The
Vatican
has
gone
mad.
Like
a
lazy
parent
who
found
it
easier
to
acquiesce
to
the
whims
of
a
spoiled
child
than
to
stand
firm
and
teach
values,
the
Church
just
kept
softening
at
every
turn,
trying
to
reinvent
itself
to
accommodate
a
culture
gone
astray.
The
top
floor's
corridor
was
wide,
lushly
appointed,
and
led
in
only
one
direction
toward
a
huge
set
of
oak
doors
with
a
brass
sign.
BIBLIOTECA
ASTRONOMICA
Aringarosa
had
heard
of
this
place
the
Vatican's
Astronomy
Library
rumored
to
contain
more
than
twenty
five
thousand
volumes,
including
rare
works
of
Copernicus,
Galileo,
Kepler,
Newton,
and
Secchi.
Allegedly,
it
was
also
the
place
in
which
the
Pope's
highest
officers
held
private
meetings
those
meetings
they
preferred
not
to
hold
within
the
walls
of
Vatican
City.
Approaching
the
door,
Bishop
Aringarosa
would
never
have
imagined
the
shocking
news
he
was
about
to
receive
inside,
or
the
deadly
chain
of
events
it
would
put
into
motion.
It
was
not
until
an
hour
later,
as
he
staggered
from
the
meeting,
that
the
devastating
implications
settled
in.
Six
months
from
now!
he
had
thought.
God
help
us!
Now,
seated
in
the
Fiat,
Bishop
Aringarosa
realized
his
fists
were
clenched
just
thinking
about
that
first
meeting.
He
released
his
grip
and
forced
a
slow
inhalation,
relaxing
his
muscles.
Everything
will
be
fine,
he
told
himself
as
the
Fiat
wound
higher
into
the
mountains.
Still,
he
wished
his
cell
phone
would
ring.
Why
hasn't
the
Teacher
called
me?
Silas
should
have
the
keystone
by
now.
Trying
to
ease
his
nerves,
the
bishop
meditated
on
the
purple
amethyst
in
his
ring.
Feeling
the
textures
of
the
mitre
crozier
applique
and
the
facets
of
the
diamonds,
he
reminded
himself
that
this
ring
was
a
symbol
of
power
far
less
than
that
which
he
would
soon
attain.
The
inside
of
Gare
Saint
Lazare
looked
like
every
other
train
station
in
Europe,
a
gaping
indoor
outdoor
cavern
dotted
with
the
usual
suspects
homeless
men
holding
cardboard
signs,
collections
of
bleary
eyed
college
kids
sleeping
on
backpacks
and
zoning
out
to
their
portable
MP3
players,
and
clusters
of
blue
clad
baggage
porters
smoking
cigarettes.
Sophie
raised
her
eyes
to
the
enormous
departure
board
overhead.
The
black
and
white
tabs
reshuffled,
ruffling
downward
as
the
information
refreshed.
When
the
update
was
finished,
Langdon
eyed
the
offerings.
The
topmost
listing
read:
LYON
RAPIDE
3:06
"I
wish
it
left
sooner,"
Sophie
said,
"but
Lyon
will
have
to
do."
Sooner?
Langdon
checked
his
watch
2:59
A.M.
The
train
left
in
seven
minutes
and
they
didn't
even
have
tickets
yet.
Sophie
guided
Langdon
toward
the
ticket
window
and
said,
"Buy
us
two
tickets
with
your
credit
card."
"I
thought
credit
card
usage
could
be
traced
by
"Exactly."
