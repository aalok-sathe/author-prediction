of
what
you
intend
to
do
with
these
funds,
and
if
it
is
in
any
way
illegal"
"Considering
what
you
are
asking
of
me,"
Aringarosa
countered,
"what
I
do
with
this
money
is
not
your
concern.
There
was
a
long
silence.
They
know
I'm
right,
Aringarosa
thought.
"Now,
I
imagine
you
have
something
for
me
to
sign?"
They
all
jumped,
eagerly
pushing
the
paper
toward
him,
as
if
they
wished
he
would
simply
leave.
Aringarosa
eyed
the
sheet
before
him.
It
bore
the
papal
seal.
"This
is
identical
to
the
copy
you
sent
me?"
"Exactly."
Aringarosa
was
surprised
how
little
emotion
he
felt
as
he
signed
the
document.
The
three
men
present,
however,
seemed
to
sigh
in
relief.
"Thank
you,
Bishop,"
the
secretariat
said.
"Your
service
to
the
Church
will
never
be
forgotten."
Aringarosa
picked
up
the
briefcase,
sensing
promise
and
authority
in
its
weight.
The
four
men
looked
at
one
another
for
a
moment
as
if
there
were
something
more
to
say,
but
apparently
there
was
not.
Aringarosa
turned
and
headed
for
the
door.
"Bishop?"
one
of
the
cardinals
called
out
as
Aringarosa
reached
the
threshold.
Aringarosa
paused,
turning.
"Yes?"
"Where
will
you
go
from
here?"
Aringarosa
sensed
the
query
was
more
spiritual
than
geographical,
and
yet
he
had
no
intention
of
discussing
morality
at
this
hour.
"Paris,"
he
said,
and
walked
out
the
door.
The
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
was
a
twenty
four
hour
Geldschrank
bank
offering
the
full
modern
array
of
anonymous
services
in
the
tradition
of
the
Swiss
numbered
account.
Maintaining
offices
in
Zurich,
Kuala
Lumpur,
New
York,
and
Paris,
the
bank
had
expanded
its
services
in
recent
years
to
offer
anonymous
computer
source
code
escrow
services
and
faceless
digitized
backup.
The
bread
and
butter
of
its
operation
was
by
far
its
oldest
and
simplest
offering
the
anonyme
Lager
blind
drop
services,
otherwise
known
as
anonymous
safe
deposit
boxes.
Clients
wishing
to
store
anything
from
stock
certificates
to
valuable
paintings
could
deposit
their
belongings
anonymously,
through
a
series
of
high
tech
veils
of
privacy,
withdrawing
items
at
any
time,
also
in
total
anonymity.
As
Sophie
pulled
the
taxi
to
a
stop
in
front
of
their
destination,
Langdon
gazed
out
at
the
building's
uncompromising
architecture
and
sensed
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
was
a
firm
with
little
sense
of
humor.
The
building
was
a
windowless
rectangle
that
seemed
to
be
forged
entirely
of
dull
steel.
Resembling
an
enormous
metal
brick,
the
edifice
sat
back
from
the
road
with
a
fifteen
foot
tall,
neon,
equilateral
cross
glowing
over
its
facade.
Switzerland's
reputation
for
secrecy
in
banking
had
become
one
of
the
country's
most
lucrative
exports.
Facilities
like
this
had
become
controversial
in
the
art
community
because
they
provided
a
perfect
place
for
art
thieves
to
hide
stolen
goods,
for
years
if
necessary,
until
the
heat
was
off.
Because
deposits
were
protected
from
police
inspection
by
privacy
laws
and
were
attached
to
numbered
accounts
rather
than
people's
names,
thieves
could
rest
easily
knowing
their
stolen
goods
were
safe
and
could
never
be
traced
to
them.
Sophie
stopped
the
taxi
at
an
imposing
gate
that
blocked
the
bank's
driveway
a
cement
lined
ramp
that
descended
beneath
the
building.
A
video
camera
overhead
was
aimed
directly
at
them,
and
Langdon
had
the
feeling
that
this
camera,
unlike
those
at
the
Louvre,
was
authentic.
Sophie
rolled
down
the
window
and
surveyed
the
electronic
podium
on
the
driver's
side.
An
LCD
screen
provided
directions
in
seven
languages.
Topping
the
list
was
English.
INSERT
KEY.
Sophie
took
the
gold
laser
pocked
key
from
her
pocket
and
turned
her
attention
back
to
the
podium.
Below
the
screen
was
a
triangular
hole.
"Something
tells
me
it
will
fit,"
Langdon
said.
Sophie
aligned
the
key's
triangular
shaft
with
the
hole
and
inserted
it,
sliding
it
in
until
the
entire
shaft
had
disappeared.
This
key
apparently
required
no
turning.
Instantly,
the
gate
began
to
swing
open.
Sophie
took
her
foot
off
the
brake
and
coasted
down
to
a
second
gate
and
podium.
Behind
her,
the
first
gate
closed,
trapping
them
like
a
ship
in
a
lock.
Langdon
disliked
the
constricted
sensation.
Let's
hope
this
second
gate
works
too.
This
second
podium
bore
familiar
directions.
INSERT
KEY.
When
Sophie
inserted
the
key,
the
second
gate
immediately
opened.
Moments
later
they
were
winding
down
the
ramp
into
the
belly
of
the
structure.
The
private
garage
was
small
and
dim,
with
spaces
for
about
a
dozen
cars.
At
the
far
end,
Langdon
spied
the
building's
main
entrance.
A
red
carpet
stretched
across
the
cement
floor,
welcoming
visitors
to
a
huge
door
that
appeared
to
be
forged
of
solid
metal.
Talk
about
mixed
messages,
Langdon
thought.
Welcome
and
keep
out.
Sophie
pulled
the
taxi
into
a
parking
space
near
the
entrance
and
killed
the
engine.
"You'd
better
leave
the
gun
here."
With
pleasure,
Langdon
thought,
sliding
the
pistol
under
the
seat.
Sophie
and
Langdon
got
out
and
walked
up
the
red
carpet
toward
the
slab
of
steel.
The
door
had
no
handle,
but
on
the
wall
beside
it
was
another
triangular
keyhole.
No
directions
were
posted
this
time.
"Keeps
out
the
slow
learners,"
Langdon
said.
Sophie
laughed,
looking
nervous.
"Here
we
go."
She
stuck
the
key
in
the
hole,
and
the
door
swung
inward
with
a
low
hum.
Exchanging
glances,
Sophie
and
Langdon
entered.
The
door
shut
with
a
thud
behind
them.
The
foyer
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
employed
as
imposing
a
decor
as
any
Langdon
had
ever
seen.
Where
most
banks
were
content
with
the
usual
polished
marble
and
granite,
this
one
had
opted
for
wall
to
wall
metal
and
rivets.
Who's
their
decorator?
Langdon
wondered.
Allied
Steel?
Sophie
looked
equally
intimidated
as
her
eyes
scanned
the
lobby.
The
gray
metal
was
everywhere
the
floor,
walls,
counters,
doors,
even
the
lobby
chairs
appeared
to
be
fashioned
of
molded
iron.
Nonetheless,
the
effect
was
impressive.
The
message
was
clear:
You
are
walking
into
a
vault.
A
large
man
behind
the
counter
glanced
up
as
they
entered.
He
turned
off
the
