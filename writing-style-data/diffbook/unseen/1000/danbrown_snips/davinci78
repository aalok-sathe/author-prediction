etes
vous?"
the
woman
said.
"Your
name?"
Aringarosa
was
uncertain
if
he
should
reveal
it.
The
French
Judicial
Police
?
"Your
name,
monsieur?"
the
woman
pressed.
"Bishop
Manuel
Aringarosa."
"Un
moment.
"
There
was
a
click
on
the
line.
After
a
long
wait,
another
man
came
on,
his
tone
gruff
and
concerned.
"Bishop,
I
am
glad
I
finally
reached
you.
You
and
I
have
much
to
discuss."
Sangreal
Sang
Real
San
Great.
Royal
Blood
Holy
Grail.
It
was
all
intertwined.
The
Holy
Grail
is
Mary
Magdalene
the
mother
of
the
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ.
Sophie
felt
a
new
wave
of
disorientation
as
she
stood
in
the
silence
of
the
ballroom
and
stared
at
Robert
Langdon.
The
more
pieces
Langdon
and
Teabing
laid
on
the
table
tonight,
the
more
unpredictable
this
puzzle
became.
"As
you
can
see,
my
dear,"
Teabing
said,
hobbling
toward
a
bookshelf,
"Leonardo
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
been
trying
to
tell
the
world
the
truth
about
the
Holy
Grail.
The
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ
has
been
chronicled
in
exhaustive
detail
by
scores
of
historians."
He
ran
a
finger
down
a
row
of
several
dozen
books.
Sophie
tilted
her
head
and
scanned
the
list
of
titles:
THE
TEMPLAR
REVELATION:
Secret
Guardians
of
the
True
Identity
of
Christ
THE
WOMAN
WITH
THE
ALABASTER
JAR:
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
Holy
Grail
THE
GODDESS
IN
THE
GOSPELS
Reclaiming
the
Sacred
Feminine
"Here
is
perhaps
the
best
known
tome,"
Teabing
said,
pulling
a
tattered
hardcover
from
the
stack
and
handing
it
to
her.
The
cover
read:
HOLY
BLOOD,
HOLY
GRAIL
The
Acclaimed
International
Bestseller
Sophie
glanced
up.
"An
international
bestseller?
I've
never
heard
of
it."
"You
were
young.
This
caused
quite
a
stir
back
in
the
nineteen
eighties.
To
my
taste,
the
authors
made
some
dubious
leaps
of
faith
in
their
analysis,
but
their
fundamental
premise
is
sound,
and
to
their
credit,
they
finally
brought
the
idea
of
Christ's
bloodline
into
the
mainstream."
"What
was
the
Church's
reaction
to
the
book?"
"Outrage,
of
course.
But
that
was
to
be
expected.
After
all,
this
was
a
secret
the
Vatican
had
tried
to
bury
in
the
fourth
century.
That's
part
of
what
the
Crusades
were
about.
Gathering
and
destroying
information.
The
threat
Mary
Magdalene
posed
to
the
men
of
the
early
Church
was
potentially
ruinous.
Not
only
was
she
the
woman
to
whom
Jesus
had
assigned
the
task
of
founding
the
Church,
but
she
also
had
physical
proof
that
the
Church's
newly
proclaimed
deity
had
spawned
a
mortal
bloodline.
The
Church,
in
order
to
defend
itself
against
the
Magdalene's
power,
perpetuated
her
image
as
a
whore
and
buried
evidence
of
Christ's
marriage
to
her,
thereby
defusing
any
potential
claims
that
Christ
had
a
surviving
bloodline
and
was
a
mortal
prophet."
Sophie
glanced
at
Langdon,
who
nodded.
"Sophie,
the
historical
evidence
supporting
this
is
substantial."
"I
admit,"
Teabing
said,
"the
assertions
are
dire,
but
you
must
understand
the
Church's
powerful
motivations
to
conduct
such
a
cover
up.
They
could
never
have
survived
public
knowledge
of
a
bloodline.
A
child
of
Jesus
would
undermine
the
critical
notion
of
Christ's
divinity
and
therefore
the
Christian
Church,
which
declared
itself
the
sole
vessel
through
which
humanity
could
access
the
divine
and
gain
entrance
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven."
"The
five
petal
rose,"
Sophie
said,
pointing
suddenly
to
the
spine
of
one
of
Teabing's
books.
The
same
exact
design
inlaid
on
the
rosewood
box.
Teabing
glanced
at
Langdon
and
grinned.
"She
has
a
good
eye."
He
turned
back
to
Sophie.
"That
is
the
Priory
symbol
for
the
Grail.
Mary
Magdalene.
Because
her
name
was
forbidden
by
the
Church,
Mary
Magdalene
became
secretly
known
by
many
pseudonyms
the
Chalice,
the
Holy
Grail,
and
the
Rose."
He
paused.
"The
Rose
has
ties
to
the
five
pointed
pentacle
of
Venus
and
the
guiding
Compass
Rose.
By
the
way,
the
word
rose
is
identical
in
English,
French,
German,
and
many
other
languages."
"Rose,"
Langdon
added,
"is
also
an
anagram
of
Eros,
the
Greek
god
of
sexual
love."
Sophie
gave
him
a
surprised
look
as
Teabing
plowed
on.
"The
Rose
has
always
been
the
premiere
symbol
of
female
sexuality.
In
primitive
goddess
cults,
the
five
petals
represented
the
five
stations
of
female
life
birth,
menstruation,
motherhood,
menopause,
and
death.
And
in
modern
times,
the
flowering
rose's
ties
to
womanhood
are
considered
more
visual."
He
glanced
at
Robert.
"Perhaps
the
symbologist
could
explain?"
Robert
hesitated.
A
moment
too
long.
"Oh,
heavens!"
Teabing
huffed.
"You
Americans
are
such
prudes."
He
looked
back
at
Sophie.
"What
Robert
is
fumbling
with
is
the
fact
that
the
blossoming
flower
resembles
the
female
genitalia,
the
sublime
blossom
from
which
all
mankind
enters
the
world.
And
if
you've
ever
seen
any
paintings
by
Georgia
O'Keeffe,
you'll
know
exactly
what
I
mean.
"The
point
here,"
Langdon
said,
motioning
back
to
the
bookshelf,
"is
that
all
of
these
books
substantiate
the
same
historical
claim."
"That
Jesus
was
a
father."
Sophie
was
still
uncertain.
"Yes,"
Teabing
said.
"And
that
Mary
Magdalene
was
the
womb
that
carried
His
royal
lineage.
The
Priory
of
Sion,
to
this
day,
still
worships
Mary
Magdalene
as
the
Goddess,
the
Holy
Grail,
the
Rose,
and
the
Divine
Mother."
Sophie
again
flashed
on
the
ritual
in
the
basement.
"According
to
the
Priory,"
Teabing
continued,
"Mary
Magdalene
was
pregnant
at
the
time
of
the
crucifixion.
For
the
safety
of
Christ's
unborn
child,
she
had
no
choice
but
to
flee
the
Holy
Land.
With
the
help
of
Jesus'
trusted
uncle,
Joseph
of
Arimathea,
Mary
Magdalene
secretly
traveled
to
France,
then
known
as
Gaul.
There
she
found
safe
refuge
in
the
Jewish
community.
It
was
here
in
France
that
she
gave
birth
to
a
daughter.
Her
name
was
Sarah."
Sophie
glanced
up.
"They
actually
know
the
child's
name?"
"Far
more
than
that.
Magdalene's
and
Sarah's
lives
were
scrutinously
chronicled
by
their
Jewish
protectors.
Remember
that
Magdalene's
child
belonged
to
the
lineage
of
Jewish
kings
David
and
Solomon.
For
this
reason,
the
Jews
in
France
considered
Magdalene
sacred
royalty
and
revered
