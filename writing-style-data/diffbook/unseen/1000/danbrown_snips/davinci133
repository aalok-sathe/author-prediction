powerful
magnetic
field
that
emanated
inexplicably
from
these
coordinates,
some
claimed
they
came
to
search
the
hillside
for
a
hidden
entrance
to
the
vault,
but
most
admitted
they
had
come
simply
to
wander
the
grounds
and
absorb
the
lore
of
the
Holy
Grail.
Although
Langdon
had
never
been
to
Rosslyn
before
now,
he
always
chuckled
when
he
heard
the
chapel
described
as
the
current
home
of
the
Holy
Grail.
Admittedly,
Rosslyn
once
might
have
been
home
to
the
Grail,
long
ago
but
certainly
no
longer.
Far
too
much
attention
had
been
drawn
to
Rosslyn
in
past
decades,
and
sooner
or
later
someone
would
find
a
way
to
break
into
the
vault.
True
Grail
academics
agreed
that
Rosslyn
was
a
decoy
one
of
the
devious
dead
ends
the
Priory
crafted
so
convincingly.
Tonight,
however,
with
the
Priory's
keystone
offering
a
verse
that
pointed
directly
to
this
spot,
Langdon
no
longer
felt
so
smug.
A
perplexing
question
had
been
running
through
his
mind
all
day:
Why
would
Sauniere
go
to
such
effort
to
guide
us
to
so
obvious
a
location?
There
seemed
only
one
logical
answer.
There
is
something
about
Rosslyn
we
have
yet
to
understand.
"Robert?"
Sophie
was
standing
outside
the
car,
looking
back
at
him.
"Are
you
corning?"
She
was
holding
the
rosewood
box,
which
Captain
Fache
had
returned
to
them.
Inside,
both
cryptexes
had
been
reassembled
and
nested
as
they
had
been
found.
The
papyrus
verse
was
locked
safely
at
its
core
minus
the
shattered
vial
of
vinegar.
Making
their
way
up
the
long
gravel
path,
Langdon
and
Sophie
passed
the
famous
west
wall
of
the
chapel.
Casual
visitors
assumed
this
oddly
protruding
wall
was
a
section
of
the
chapel
that
had
not
been
finished.
The
truth,
Langdon
recalled,
was
far
more
intriguing.
The
west
wall
of
Solomon's
Temple.
The
Knights
Templar
had
designed
Rosslyn
Chapel
as
an
exact
architectural
blueprint
of
Solomon's
Temple
in
Jerusalem
complete
with
a
west
wall,
a
narrow
rectangular
sanctuary,
and
a
subterranean
vault
like
the
Holy
of
Holies,
in
which
the
original
nine
knights
had
first
unearthed
their
priceless
treasure.
Langdon
had
to
admit,
there
existed
an
intriguing
symmetry
in
the
idea
of
the
Templars
building
a
modern
Grail
repository
that
echoed
the
Grail's
original
hiding
place.
Rosslyn
Chapel's
entrance
was
more
modest
than
Langdon
expected.
The
small
wooden
door
had
two
iron
hinges
and
a
simple,
oak
sign.
ROSLIN
This
ancient
spelling,
Langdon
explained
to
Sophie,
derived
from
the
Rose
Line
meridian
on
which
the
chapel
sat;
or,
as
Grail
academics
preferred
to
believe,
from
the
"Line
of
Rose"
the
ancestral
lineage
of
Mary
Magdalene.
The
chapel
would
be
closing
soon,
and
as
Langdon
pulled
open
the
door,
a
warm
puff
of
air
escaped,
as
if
the
ancient
edifice
were
heaving
a
weary
sigh
at
the
end
of
a
long
day.
Her
entry
arches
burgeoned
with
carved
cinquefoils.
Roses.
The
womb
of
the
goddess.
Entering
with
Sophie,
Langdon
felt
his
eyes
reaching
across
the
famous
sanctuary
and
taking
it
all
in.
Although
he
had
read
accounts
of
Rosslyn's
arrestingly
intricate
stonework,
seeing
it
in
person
was
an
overwhelming
encounter.
Symbology
heaven,
one
of
Langdon's
colleagues
had
called
it.
Every
surface
in
the
chapel
had
been
carved
with
symbols
Christian
cruciforms,
Jewish
stars,
Masonic
seals,
Templar
crosses,
cornucopias,
pyramids,
astrological
signs,
plants,
vegetables,
pentacles,
and
roses.
The
Knights
Templar
had
been
master
stonemasons,
erecting
Templar
churches
all
over
Europe,
but
Rosslyn
was
considered
their
most
sublime
labor
of
love
and
veneration.
The
master
masons
had
left
no
stone
uncarved.
Rosslyn
Chapel
was
a
shrine
to
all
faiths
to
all
traditions
and,
above
all,
to
nature
and
the
goddess.
The
sanctuary
was
empty
except
for
a
handful
of
visitors
listening
to
a
young
man
giving
the
day's
last
tour.
He
was
leading
them
in
a
single
file
line
along
a
well
known
route
on
the
floor
an
invisible
pathway
linking
six
key
architectural
points
within
the
sanctuary.
Generations
of
visitors
had
walked
these
straight
lines,
connecting
the
points,
and
their
countless
footsteps
had
engraved
an
enormous
symbol
on
the
floor.
The
Star
of
David,
Langdon
thought.
No
coincidence
there.
Also
known
as
Solomon's
Seal,
this
hexagram
had
once
been
the
secret
symbol
of
the
stargazing
priests
and
was
later
adopted
by
the
Israelite
kings
David
and
Solomon.
The
docent
had
seen
Langdon
and
Sophie
enter,
and
although
it
was
closing
time,
offered
a
pleasant
smile
and
motioned
for
them
to
feel
free
to
look
around.
Langdon
nodded
his
thanks
and
began
to
move
deeper
into
the
sanctuary.
Sophie,
however,
stood
riveted
in
the
entryway,
a
puzzled
look
on
her
face.
"What
is
it?"
Langdon
asked.
Sophie
stared
out
at
the
chapel.
"I
think
I've
been
here."
Langdon
was
surprised.
"But
you
said
you
hadn't
even
heard
of
Rosslyn."
"I
hadn't"
She
scanned
the
sanctuary,
looking
uncertain.
"My
grandfather
must
have
brought
me
here
when
I
was
very
young.
I
don't
know.
It
feels
familiar."
As
her
eyes
scanned
the
room,
she
began
nodding
with
more
certainty.
"Yes."
She
pointed
to
the
front
of
the
sanctuary.
"Those
two
pillars
I've
seen
them."
Langdon
looked
at
the
pair
of
intricately
sculpted
columns
at
the
far
end
of
the
sanctuary.
Their
white
lacework
carvings
seemed
to
smolder
with
a
ruddy
glow
as
the
last
of
the
day's
sunlight
streamed
in
through
the
west
window.
The
pillars
positioned
where
the
altar
would
normally
stand
were
an
oddly
matched
pair.
The
pillar
on
the
left
was
carved
with
simple,
vertical
lines,
while
the
pillar
on
the
right
was
embellished
with
an
ornate,
flowering
spiral.
Sophie
was
already
moving
toward
them.
Langdon
hurried
after
her,
and
as
they
reached
the
pillars,
Sophie
was
nodding
with
incredulity.
"Yes,
I'm
positive
I
have
seen
these!"
"I
don't
doubt
you've
seen
them,"
Langdon
said,
"but
it
wasn't
necessarily
here.
She
turned.
"What
do
you
mean?"
"These
two
pillars
are
the
most
duplicated
architectural
structures
in
history.
Replicas
exist
all
over
the
world."
"Replicas
of
Rosslyn?"
She
looked
skeptical.
"No.
Of
the
pillars.
Do
