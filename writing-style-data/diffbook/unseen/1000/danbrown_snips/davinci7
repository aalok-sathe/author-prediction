out
through
a
series
of
interconnected
galleries.
Langdon
followed,
his
vision
slowly
adjusting
to
the
dark.
All
around,
large
format
oils
began
to
materialize
like
photos
developing
before
him
in
an
enormous
darkroom
their
eyes
following
as
he
moved
through
the
rooms.
He
could
taste
the
familiar
tang
of
museum
air
an
arid,
deionized
essence
that
carried
a
faint
hint
of
carbon
the
product
of
industrial,
coal
filter
dehumidifiers
that
ran
around
the
clock
to
counteract
the
corrosive
carbon
dioxide
exhaled
by
visitors.
Mounted
high
on
the
walls,
the
visible
security
cameras
sent
a
clear
message
to
visitors:
We
see
you.
Do
not
touch
anything.
"Any
of
them
real?"
Langdon
asked,
motioning
to
the
cameras.
Fache
shook
his
head.
"Of
course
not."
Langdon
was
not
surprised.
Video
surveillance
in
museums
this
size
was
cost
prohibitive
and
ineffective.
With
acres
of
galleries
to
watch
over,
the
Louvre
would
require
several
hundred
technicians
simply
to
monitor
the
feeds.
Most
large
museums
now
used
"containment
security."
Forget
keeping
thieves
out.
Keep
them
in.
Containment
was
activated
after
hours,
and
if
an
intruder
removed
a
piece
of
artwork,
compartmentalized
exits
would
seal
around
that
gallery,
and
the
thief
would
find
himself
behind
bars
even
before
the
police
arrived.
The
sound
of
voices
echoed
down
the
marble
corridor
up
ahead.
The
noise
seemed
to
be
coming
from
a
large
recessed
alcove
that
lay
ahead
on
the
right.
A
bright
light
spilled
out
into
the
hallway.
"Office
of
the
curator,"
the
captain
said.
As
he
and
Fache
drew
nearer
the
alcove,
Langdon
peered
down
a
short
hallway,
into
Sauniere's
luxurious
study
warm
wood,
Old
Master
paintings,
and
an
enormous
antique
desk
on
which
stood
a
two
foot
tall
model
of
a
knight
in
full
armor.
A
handful
of
police
agents
bustled
about
the
room,
talking
on
phones
and
taking
notes.
One
of
them
was
seated
at
Sauniere's
desk,
typing
into
a
laptop.
Apparently,
the
curator's
private
office
had
become
DCPJ's
makeshift
command
post
for
the
evening.
"Messieurs,
"
Fache
called
out,
and
the
men
turned.
"Ne
nous
derangez
pas
sous
aucun
pretexte.
Entendu?"
Everyone
inside
the
office
nodded
their
understanding.
Langdon
had
hung
enough
NE
PAS
DERANGER
signs
on
hotel
room
doors
to
catch
the
gist
of
the
captain's
orders.
Fache
and
Langdon
were
not
to
be
disturbed
under
any
circumstances.
Leaving
the
small
congregation
of
agents
behind,
Fache
led
Langdon
farther
down
the
darkened
hallway.
Thirty
yards
ahead
loomed
the
gateway
to
the
Louvre's
most
popular
section
la
Grande
Galerie
a
seemingly
endless
corridor
that
housed
the
Louvre's
most
valuable
Italian
masterpieces.
Langdon
had
already
discerned
that
this
was
where
Sauniere's
body
lay;
the
Grand
Gallery's
famous
parquet
floor
had
been
unmistakable
in
the
Polaroid.
As
they
approached,
Langdon
saw
the
entrance
was
blocked
by
an
enormous
steel
grate
that
looked
like
something
used
by
medieval
castles
to
keep
out
marauding
armies.
"Containment
security,
"
Fache
said,
as
they
neared
the
grate.
Even
in
the
darkness,
the
barricade
looked
like
it
could
have
restrained
a
tank.
Arriving
outside,
Langdon
peered
through
the
bars
into
the
dimly
lit
caverns
of
the
Grand
Gallery.
"After
you,
Mr.
Langdon,"
Fache
said.
Langdon
turned.
After
me,
where
?
Fache
motioned
toward
the
floor
at
the
base
of
the
grate.
Langdon
looked
down.
In
the
darkness,
he
hadn't
noticed.
The
barricade
was
raised
about
two
feet,
providing
an
awkward
clearance
underneath.
"This
area
is
still
off
limits
to
Louvre
security,"
Fache
said.
"My
team
from
Police
Technique
et
Scientifique
has
just
finished
their
investigation."
He
motioned
to
the
opening.
"Please
slide
under."
Langdon
stared
at
the
narrow
crawl
space
at
his
feet
and
then
up
at
the
massive
iron
grate.
He's
kidding,
right?
The
barricade
looked
like
a
guillotine
waiting
to
crush
intruders.
Fache
grumbled
something
in
French
and
checked
his
watch.
Then
he
dropped
to
his
knees
and
slithered
his
bulky
frame
underneath
the
grate.
On
the
other
side,
he
stood
up
and
looked
back
through
the
bars
at
Langdon.
Langdon
sighed.
Placing
his
palms
flat
on
the
polished
parquet,
he
lay
on
his
stomach
and
pulled
himself
forward.
As
he
slid
underneath,
the
nape
of
his
Harris
tweed
snagged
on
the
bottom
of
the
grate,
and
he
cracked
the
back
of
his
head
on
the
iron.
Very
suave,
Robert,
he
thought,
fumbling
and
then
finally
pulling
himself
through.
As
he
stood
up,
Langdon
was
beginning
to
suspect
it
was
going
to
be
a
very
long
night.
Murray
Hill
Place
the
new
Opus
Dei
World
Headquarters
and
conference
center
is
located
at
243
Lexington
Avenue
in
New
York
City.
With
a
price
tag
of
just
over
$47
million,
the
133,000
square
foot
tower
is
clad
in
red
brick
and
Indiana
limestone.
Designed
by
May
&amp;
Pinska,
the
building
contains
over
one
hundred
bedrooms,
six
dining
rooms,
libraries,
living
rooms,
meeting
rooms,
and
offices.
The
second,
eighth,
and
sixteenth
floors
contain
chapels,
ornamented
with
mill
work
and
marble.
The
seventeenth
floor
is
entirely
residential.
Men
enter
the
building
through
the
main
doors
on
Lexington
Avenue.
Women
enter
through
a
side
street
and
are
"acoustically
and
visually
separated"
from
the
men
at
all
times
within
the
building.
Earlier
this
evening,
within
the
sanctuary
of
his
penthouse
apartment,
Bishop
Manuel
Aringarosa
had
packed
a
small
travel
bag
and
dressed
in
a
traditional
black
cassock.
Normally,
he
would
have
wrapped
a
purple
cincture
around
his
waist,
but
tonight
he
would
be
traveling
among
the
public,
and
he
preferred
not
to
draw
attention
to
his
high
office.
Only
those
with
a
keen
eye
would
notice
his
14
karat
gold
bishop's
ring
with
purple
amethyst,
large
diamonds,
and
hand
tooled
mitre
crozier
applique.
Throwing
the
travel
bag
over
his
shoulder,
he
said
a
silent
prayer
and
left
his
apartment,
descending
to
the
lobby
where
his
driver
was
waiting
to
take
him
to
the
airport.
Now,
sitting
aboard
a
commercial
airliner
bound
for
Rome,
Aringarosa
gazed
out
the
window
at
the
dark
Atlantic.
The
sun
had
already
set,
but
Aringarosa
knew
his
own
star
was
on
