He
almost
laughed
out
loud
at
the
absurdity
of
it.
The
Grail
was
believed
to
be
somewhere
in
England,
buried
in
a
hidden
chamber
beneath
one
of
the
many
Templar
churches,
where
it
had
been
hidden
since
at
least
1500.
The
era
of
Grand
Master
Da
Vinci.
The
Priory,
in
order
to
keep
their
powerful
documents
safe,
had
been
forced
to
move
them
many
times
in
the
early
centuries.
Historians
now
suspected
as
many
as
six
different
Grail
relocations
since
its
arrival
in
Europe
from
Jerusalem.
The
last
Grail
"sighting"
had
been
in
1447
when
numerous
eyewitnesses
described
a
fire
that
had
broken
out
and
almost
engulfed
the
documents
before
they
were
carried
to
safety
in
four
huge
chests
that
each
required
six
men
to
carry.
After
that,
nobody
claimed
to
see
the
Grail
ever
again.
All
that
remained
were
occasional
whisperings
that
it
was
hidden
in
Great
Britain,
the
land
of
King
Arthur
and
the
Knights
of
the
Round
Table.
Wherever
it
was,
two
important
facts
remained:
Leonardo
knew
where
the
Grail
resided
during
his
lifetime.
That
hiding
place
had
probably
not
changed
to
this
day.
For
this
reason,
Grail
enthusiasts
still
pored
over
Da
Vinci's
art
and
diaries
in
hopes
of
unearthing
a
hidden
clue
as
to
the
Grail's
current
location.
Some
claimed
the
mountainous
backdrop
in
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
matched
the
topography
of
a
series
of
cave
ridden
hills
in
Scotland.
Others
insisted
that
the
suspicious
placement
of
disciples
in
The
Last
Supper
was
some
kind
of
code.
Still
others
claimed
that
X
rays
of
the
Mona
Lisa
revealed
she
originally
had
been
painted
wearing
a
lapis
lazuli
pendant
of
Isis
a
detail
Da
Vinci
purportedly
later
decided
to
paint
over.
Langdon
had
never
seen
any
evidence
of
the
pendant,
nor
could
he
imagine
how
it
could
possibly
reveal
the
Holy
Grail,
and
yet
Grail
aficionados
still
discussed
it
ad
nauseum
on
Internet
bulletin
boards
and
worldwideweb
chat
rooms.
Everyone
loves
a
conspiracy.
And
the
conspiracies
kept
coming.
Most
recently,
of
course,
had
been
the
earthshaking
discovery
that
Da
Vinci's
famed
Adoration
of
the
Magi
was
hiding
a
dark
secret
beneath
its
layers
of
paint.
Italian
art
diagnostician
Maurizio
Seracini
had
unveiled
the
unsettling
truth,
which
the
New
York
Times
Magazine
carried
prominently
in
a
story
titled
"The
Leonardo
Cover
Up."
Seracini
had
revealed
beyond
any
doubt
that
while
the
Adoration's
gray
green
sketched
underdrawing
was
indeed
Da
Vinci's
work,
the
painting
itself
was
not.
The
truth
was
that
some
anonymous
painter
had
filled
in
Da
Vinci's
sketch
like
a
paint
by
numbers
years
after
Da
Vinci's
death.
Far
more
troubling,
however,
was
what
lay
beneath
the
impostor's
paint.
Photographs
taken
with
infrared
reflectography
and
X
ray
suggested
that
this
rogue
painter,
while
filling
in
Da
Vinci's
sketched
study,
had
made
suspicious
departures
from
the
underdrawing
as
if
to
subvert
Da
Vinci's
true
intention.
Whatever
the
true
nature
of
the
underdrawing,
it
had
yet
to
be
made
public.
Even
so,
embarrassed
officials
at
Florence's
Uffizi
Gallery
immediately
banished
the
painting
to
a
warehouse
across
the
street.
Visitors
at
the
gallery's
Leonardo
Room
now
found
a
misleading
and
unapologetic
plaque
where
the
Adoration
once
hung.
THIS
WORK
IS
UNDERGOING
DIAGNOSTIC
TESTS
IN
PREPARATION
FOR
RESTORATION.
In
the
bizarre
underworld
of
modern
Grail
seekers,
Leonardo
da
Vinci
remained
the
quest's
great
enigma.
His
artwork
seemed
bursting
to
tell
a
secret,
and
yet
whatever
it
was
remained
hidden,
perhaps
beneath
a
layer
of
paint,
perhaps
enciphered
in
plain
view,
or
perhaps
nowhere
at
all.
Maybe
Da
Vinci's
plethora
of
tantalizing
clues
was
nothing
but
an
empty
promise
left
behind
to
frustrate
the
curious
and
bring
a
smirk
to
the
face
of
his
knowing
Mona
Lisa.
"Is
it
possible,"
Sophie
asked,
drawing
Langdon
back,
"that
the
key
you're
holding
unlocks
the
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon's
laugh
sounded
forced,
even
to
him.
"I
really
can't
imagine.
Besides,
the
Grail
is
believed
to
be
hidden
in
the
United
Kingdom
somewhere,
not
France."
He
gave
her
the
quick
history.
"But
the
Grail
seems
the
only
rational
conclusion,"
she
insisted.
"We
have
an
extremely
secure
key,
stamped
with
the
Priory
of
Sion
seal,
delivered
to
us
by
a
member
of
the
Priory
of
Sion
a
brotherhood
which,
you
just
told
me,
are
guardians
of
the
Holy
Grail."
Langdon
knew
her
contention
was
logical,
and
yet
intuitively
he
could
not
possibly
accept
it.
Rumors
existed
that
the
Priory
had
vowed
someday
to
bring
the
Grail
back
to
France
to
a
final
resting
place,
but
certainly
no
historical
evidence
existed
to
suggest
that
this
indeed
had
happened.
Even
if
the
Priory
had
managed
to
bring
the
Grail
back
to
France,
the
address
24
Rue
Haxo
near
a
tennis
stadium
hardly
sounded
like
a
noble
final
resting
place.
"Sophie,
I
really
don't
see
how
this
key
could
have
anything
to
do
with
the
Grail."
"Because
the
Grail
is
supposed
to
be
in
England?"
"Not
only
that.
The
location
of
the
Holy
Grail
is
one
of
the
best
kept
secrets
in
history.
Priory
members
wait
decades
proving
themselves
trustworthy
before
being
elevated
to
the
highest
echelons
of
the
fraternity
and
learning
where
the
Grail
is.
That
secret
is
protected
by
an
intricate
system
of
compartmentalized
knowledge,
and
although
the
Priory
brotherhood
is
very
large,
only
four
members
at
any
given
time
know
where
the
Grail
is
hidden
the
Grand
Master
and
his
three
senechaux.
The
probability
of
your
grandfather
being
one
of
those
four
top
people
is
very
slim."
My
grandfather
was
one
of
them,
Sophie
thought,
pressing
down
on
the
accelerator.
She
had
an
image
stamped
in
her
memory
that
confirmed
her
grandfather's
status
within
the
brotherhood
beyond
any
doubt.
"And
even
if
your
grandfather
were
in
the
upper
echelon,
he
would
never
be
allowed
to
reveal
anything
to
anyone
outside
the
brotherhood.
It
is
inconceivable
that
he
would
bring
you
into
the
inner
circle."
I've
already
been
there,
Sophie
thought,
picturing
the
ritual
in
the
basement.
She
wondered
if
this
were
the
moment
