images
of
a
far
gentler
physique.
The
captain
approached
the
bed
and
hoisted
a
familiar,
heavy
black
briefcase
onto
a
chair.
"I
believe
this
belongs
to
you."
Aringarosa
looked
at
the
briefcase
filled
with
bonds
and
immediately
looked
away,
feeling
only
shame.
"Yes
thank
you."
He
paused
while
working
his
fingers
across
the
seam
of
his
bedsheet,
then
continued.
"Captain,
I
have
been
giving
this
deep
thought,
and
I
need
to
ask
a
favor
of
you."
"Of
course."
"The
families
of
those
in
Paris
who
Silas"
He
paused,
swallowing
the
emotion.
"I
realize
no
sum
could
possibly
serve
as
sufficient
restitution,
and
yet,
if
you
could
be
kind
enough
to
divide
the
contents
of
this
briefcase
among
them
the
families
of
the
deceased."
Fache's
dark
eyes
studied
him
a
long
moment.
"A
virtuous
gesture,
My
Lord.
I
will
see
to
it
your
wishes
are
carried
out.
A
heavy
silence
fell
between
them.
On
the
television,
a
lean
French
police
officer
was
giving
a
press
conference
in
front
of
a
sprawling
mansion.
Fache
saw
who
it
was
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
screen.
"Lieutenant
Collet,"
a
BBC
reporter
said,
her
voice
accusing.
"Last
night,
your
captain
publicly
charged
two
innocent
people
with
murder.
Will
Robert
Langdon
and
Sophie
Neveu
be
seeking
accountability
from
your
department?
Will
this
cost
Captain
Fache
his
job?"
Lieutenant
Collet's
smile
was
tired
but
calm.
"It
is
my
experience
that
Captain
Bezu
Fache
seldom
makes
mistakes.
I
have
not
yet
spoken
to
him
on
this
matter,
but
knowing
how
he
operates,
I
suspect
his
public
manhunt
for
Agent
Neveu
and
Mr.
Langdon
was
part
of
a
ruse
to
lure
out
the
real
killer.
The
reporters
exchanged
surprised
looks.
Collet
continued.
"Whether
or
not
Mr.
Langdon
and
Agent
Neveu
were
willing
participants
in
the
sting,
I
do
not
know.
Captain
Fache
tends
to
keep
his
more
creative
methods
to
himself.
All
I
can
confirm
at
this
point
is
that
the
captain
has
successfully
arrested
the
man
responsible,
and
that
Mr.
Langdon
and
Agent
Neveu
are
both
innocent
and
safe."
Fache
had
a
faint
smile
on
his
lips
as
he
turned
back
to
Aringarosa.
"A
good
man,
that
Collet."
Several
moments
passed.
Finally,
Fache
ran
his
hand
over
his
forehead,
slicking
back
his
hair
as
he
gazed
down
at
Aringarosa.
"My
Lord,
before
I
return
to
Paris,
there
is
one
final
matter
I'd
like
to
discuss
your
impromptu
flight
to
London.
You
bribed
a
pilot
to
change
course.
In
doing
so,
you
broke
a
number
of
international
laws."
Aringarosa
slumped.
"I
was
desperate."
"Yes.
As
was
the
pilot
when
my
men
interrogated
him."
Fache
reached
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
purple
amethyst
ring
with
a
familiar
hand
tooled
mitre
crozier
applique.
Aringarosa
felt
tears
welling
as
he
accepted
the
ring
and
slipped
it
back
on
his
finger.
"You've
been
so
kind."
He
held
out
his
hand
and
clasped
Fache's.
"Thank
you."
Fache
waved
off
the
gesture,
walking
to
the
window
and
gazing
out
at
the
city,
his
thoughts
obviously
far
away.
When
he
turned,
there
was
an
uncertainty
about
him.
"My
Lord,
where
do
you
go
from
here?"
Aringarosa
had
been
asked
the
exact
same
question
as
he
left
Castel
Gandolfo
the
night
before.
"I
suspect
my
path
is
as
uncertain
as
yours."
"Yes."
Fache
paused.
"I
suspect
I
will
be
retiring
early."
Aringarosa
smiled.
"A
little
faith
can
do
wonders,
Captain.
A
little
faith.
Rosslyn
Chapel
often
called
the
Cathedral
of
Codes
stands
seven
miles
south
of
Edinburgh,
Scotland,
on
the
site
of
an
ancient
Mithraic
temple.
Built
by
the
Knights
Templar
in
1446,
the
chapel
is
engraved
with
a
mind
boggling
array
of
symbols
from
the
Jewish,
Christian,
Egyptian,
Masonic,
and
pagan
traditions.
The
chapel's
geographic
coordinates
fall
precisely
on
the
north
south
meridian
that
runs
through
Glastonbury.
This
longitudinal
Rose
Line
is
the
traditional
marker
of
King
Arthur's
Isle
of
Avalon
and
is
considered
the
central
pillar
of
Britain's
sacred
geometry.
It
is
from
this
hallowed
Rose
Line
that
Rosslyn
originally
spelled
Roslin
takes
its
name.
Rosslyn's
rugged
spires
were
casting
long
evening
shadows
as
Robert
Langdon
and
Sophie
Neveu
pulled
their
rental
car
into
the
grassy
parking
area
at
the
foot
of
the
bluff
on
which
the
chapel
stood.
Their
short
flight
from
London
to
Edinburgh
had
been
restful,
although
neither
of
them
had
slept
for
the
anticipation
of
what
lay
ahead.
Gazing
up
at
the
stark
edifice
framed
against
a
cloud
swept
sky,
Langdon
felt
like
Alice
falling
headlong
into
the
rabbit
hole.
This
must
be
a
dream.
And
yet
he
knew
the
text
of
Sauniere's
final
message
could
not
have
been
more
specific.
The
Holy
Grail
'neath
ancient
Roslin
waits.
Langdon
had
fantasized
that
Sauniere's
"Grail
map"
would
be
a
diagram
a
drawing
with
an
X
marks
the
spot
and
yet
the
Priory's
final
secret
had
been
unveiled
in
the
same
way
Sauniere
had
spoken
to
them
from
the
beginning.
Simple
verse.
Four
explicit
lines
that
pointed
without
a
doubt
to
this
very
spot.
In
addition
to
identifying
Rosslyn
by
name,
the
verse
made
reference
to
several
of
the
chapel's
renowned
architectural
features.
Despite
the
clarity
of
Sauniere's
final
revelation,
Langdon
had
been
left
feeling
more
off
balance
than
enlightened.
To
him,
Rosslyn
Chapel
seemed
far
too
obvious
a
location.
For
centuries,
this
stone
chapel
had
echoed
with
whispers
of
the
Holy
Grail's
presence.
The
whispers
had
turned
to
shouts
in
recent
decades
when
ground
penetrating
radar
revealed
the
presence
of
an
astonishing
structure
beneath
the
chapel
a
massive
subterranean
chamber.
Not
only
did
this
deep
vault
dwarf
the
chapel
atop
it,
but
it
appeared
to
have
no
entrance
or
exit.
Archaeologists
petitioned
to
begin
blasting
through
the
bedrock
to
reach
the
mysterious
chamber,
but
the
Rosslyn
Trust
expressly
forbade
any
excavation
of
the
sacred
site.
Of
course,
this
only
fueled
the
fires
of
speculation.
What
was
the
Rosslyn
Trust
trying
to
hide?
Rosslyn
had
now
become
a
pilgrimage
site
for
mystery
seekers.
Some
claimed
they
were
drawn
here
by
the
