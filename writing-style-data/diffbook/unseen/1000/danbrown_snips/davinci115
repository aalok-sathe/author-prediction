go
there
and
stay
out
of
sight.
I
will
call
you
the
moment
I
am
in
possession
of
the
keystone
and
have
attended
to
my
current
problem.
"You
are
in
London?"
"Do
as
I
say,
and
everything
will
be
fine."
"Yes,
sir."
The
Teacher
heaved
a
sigh,
as
if
what
he
now
had
to
do
was
profoundly
regrettable.
"It's
time
I
speak
to
Remy."
Silas
handed
Remy
the
phone,
sensing
it
might
be
the
last
call
Remy
Legaludec
ever
took.
As
Remy
took
the
phone,
he
knew
this
poor,
twisted
monk
had
no
idea
what
fate
awaited
him
now
that
he
had
served
his
purpose.
The
Teacher
used
you,
Silas.
And
your
bishop
is
a
pawn.
Remy
still
marveled
at
the
Teacher's
powers
of
persuasion.
Bishop
Aringarosa
had
trusted
everything.
He
had
been
blinded
by
his
own
desperation.
Aringarosa
was
far
too
eager
to
believe.
Although
Remy
did
not
particularly
like
the
Teacher,
he
felt
pride
at
having
gained
the
man's
trust
and
helped
him
so
substantially.
have
earned
my
payday.
"Listen
carefully,"
the
Teacher
said.
"Take
Silas
to
the
Opus
Dei
residence
hall
and
drop
him
off
a
few
streets
away.
Then
drive
to
St.
James's
Park.
It
is
adjacent
to
Parliament
and
Big
Ben.
You
can
park
the
limousine
on
Horse
Guards
Parade.
We'll
talk
there."
With
that,
the
connection
went
dead.
King's
College,
established
by
King
George
IV
in
1829,
houses
its
Department
of
Theology
and
Religious
Studies
adjacent
to
Parliament
on
property
granted
by
the
Crown.
King's
College
Religion
Department
boasts
not
only
150
years'
experience
in
teaching
and
research,
but
the
1982
establishment
of
the
Research
Institute
in
Systematic
Theology,
which
possesses
one
of
the
most
complete
and
electronically
advanced
religious
research
libraries
in
the
world.
Langdon
still
felt
shaky
as
he
and
Sophie
came
in
from
the
rain
and
entered
the
library.
The
primary
research
room
was
as
Teabing
had
described
it
a
dramatic
octagonal
chamber
dominated
by
an
enormous
round
table
around
which
King
Arthur
and
his
knights
might
have
been
comfortable
were
it
not
for
the
presence
of
twelve
flat
screen
computer
workstations.
On
the
far
side
of
the
room,
a
reference
librarian
was
just
pouring
a
pot
of
tea
and
settling
in
for
her
day
of
work.
"Lovely
morning,"
she
said
in
a
cheerful
British
accent,
leaving
the
tea
and
walking
over.
"May
I
help
you?"
"Thank
you,
yes,"
Langdon
replied.
"My
name
is
"Robert
Langdon."
She
gave
a
pleasant
smile.
"I
know
who
you
are."
For
an
instant,
he
feared
Fache
had
put
him
on
English
television
as
well,
but
the
librarian's
smile
suggested
otherwise.
Langdon
still
had
not
gotten
used
to
these
moments
of
unexpected
celebrity.
Then
again,
if
anyone
on
earth
were
going
to
recognize
his
face,
it
would
be
a
librarian
in
a
Religious
Studies
reference
facility.
"Pamela
Gettum,"
the
librarian
said,
offering
her
hand.
She
had
a
genial,
erudite
face
and
a
pleasingly
fluid
voice.
The
horn
rimmed
glasses
hanging
around
her
neck
were
thick.
"A
pleasure,"
Langdon
said.
"This
is
my
friend
Sophie
Neveu."
The
two
women
greeted
one
another,
and
Gettum
turned
immediately
back
to
Langdon.
"I
didn't
know
you
were
coming."
"Neither
did
we.
If
it's
not
too
much
trouble,
we
could
really
use
your
help
finding
some
information."
Gettum
shifted,
looking
uncertain.
"Normally
our
services
are
by
petition
and
appointment
only,
unless
of
course
you're
the
guest
of
someone
at
the
college?"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"I'm
afraid
we've
come
unannounced.
A
friend
of
mine
speaks
very
highly
of
you.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing?"
Langdon
felt
a
pang
of
gloom
as
he
said
the
name.
"The
British
Royal
Historian."
Gettum
brightened
now,
laughing.
"Heavens,
yes.
What
a
character.
Fanatical!
Every
time
he
comes
in,
it's
always
the
same
search
strings.
Grail.
Grail.
Grail.
I
swear
that
man
will
die
before
he
gives
up
on
that
quest."
She
winked.
"Time
and
money
afford
one
such
lovely
luxuries,
wouldn't
you
say?
A
regular
Don
Quixote,
that
one."
"Is
there
any
chance
you
can
help
us?"
Sophie
asked.
"It's
quite
important."
Gettum
glanced
around
the
deserted
library
and
then
winked
at
them
both.
"Well,
I
can't
very
well
claim
I'm
too
busy,
now
can
I?
As
long
as
you
sign
in,
I
can't
imagine
anyone
being
too
upset.
What
did
you
have
in
mind?"
"We're
trying
to
find
a
tomb
in
London."
Gettum
looked
dubious.
"We've
got
about
twenty
thousand
of
them.
Can
you
be
a
little
more
specific?"
"It's
the
tomb
of
a
knight.
We
don't
have
a
name."
"A
knight.
That
tightens
the
net
substantially.
Much
less
common."
"We
don't
have
much
information
about
the
knight
we're
looking
for,"
Sophie
said,
"but
this
is
what
we
know."
She
produced
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
she
had
written
only
the
first
two
lines
of
the
poem.
Hesitant
to
show
the
entire
poem
to
an
outsider,
Langdon
and
Sophie
had
decided
to
share
just
the
first
two
lines,
those
that
identified
the
knight.
Compartmentalized
cryptography,
Sophie
had
called
it.
When
an
intelligence
agency
intercepted
a
code
containing
sensitive
data,
cryptographers
each
worked
on
a
discrete
section
of
the
code.
This
way,
when
they
broke
it,
no
single
cryptographer
possessed
the
entire
deciphered
message.
In
this
case,
the
precaution
was
probably
excessive;
even
if
this
librarian
saw
the
entire
poem,
identified
the
knight's
tomb,
and
knew
what
orb
was
missing,
the
information
was
useless
without
the
cryptex.
Gettum
sensed
an
urgency
in
the
eyes
of
this
famed
American
scholar,
almost
as
if
his
finding
this
tomb
quickly
were
a
matter
of
critical
importance.
The
green
eyed
woman
accompanying
him
also
seemed
anxious.
Puzzled,
Gettum
put
on
her
glasses
and
examined
the
paper
they
had
just
handed
her.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
His
labor's
fruit
a
Holy
wrath
incurred.
She
glanced
at
her
guests.
"What
is
this?
Some
kind
of
Harvard
scavenger
hunt?"
Langdon's
laugh
sounded
forced.
"Yeah,
something
like
that."
Gettum
paused,
feeling
she
was
not
getting
the
whole
story.
Nonetheless,
she
