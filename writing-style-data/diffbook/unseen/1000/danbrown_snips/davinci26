want
to
be
there
when
we
make
the
arrest."
As
Fache
jogged
back
down
the
length
of
the
Grand
Gallery,
he
wondered
if
Langdon
had
even
survived
the
fall.
Not
that
it
mattered.
Langdon
ran.
Guilty
as
charged.
Only
fifteen
yards
from
the
rest
room,
Langdon
and
Sophie
stood
in
the
darkness
of
the
Grand
Gallery,
their
backs
pressed
to
one
of
the
large
partitions
that
hid
the
bathrooms
from
the
gallery.
They
had
barely
managed
to
hide
themselves
before
Fache
had
darted
past
them,
gun
drawn,
and
disappeared
into
the
bathroom.
The
last
sixty
seconds
had
been
a
blur.
Langdon
had
been
standing
inside
the
men's
room
refusing
to
run
from
a
crime
he
didn't
commit,
when
Sophie
began
eyeing
the
plate
glass
window
and
examining
the
alarm
mesh
running
through
it.
Then
she
peered
downward
into
the
street,
as
if
measuring
the
drop.
"With
a
little
aim,
you
can
get
out
of
here,"
she
said.
Aim?
Uneasy,
he
peered
out
the
rest
room
window.
Up
the
street,
an
enormous
twin
bed
eighteenwheeler
was
headed
for
the
stoplight
beneath
the
window.
Stretched
across
the
truck's
massive
cargo
bay
was
a
blue
vinyl
tarp,
loosely
covering
the
truck's
load.
Langdon
hoped
Sophie
was
not
thinking
what
she
seemed
to
be
thinking.
"Sophie,
there's
no
way
I'm
jump
"Take
out
the
tracking
dot."
Bewildered,
Langdon
fumbled
in
his
pocket
until
he
found
the
tiny
metallic
disk.
Sophie
took
it
from
him
and
strode
immediately
to
the
sink.
She
grabbed
a
thick
bar
of
soap,
placed
the
tracking
dot
on
top
of
it,
and
used
her
thumb
to
push
the
disk
down
hard
into
the
bar.
As
the
disk
sank
into
the
soft
surface,
she
pinched
the
hole
closed,
firmly
embedding
the
device
in
the
bar.
Handing
the
bar
to
Langdon,
Sophie
retrieved
a
heavy,
cylindrical
trash
can
from
under
the
sinks.
Before
Langdon
could
protest,
Sophie
ran
at
the
window,
holding
the
can
before
her
like
a
battering
ram.
Driving
the
bottom
of
the
trash
can
into
the
center
of
the
window,
she
shattered
the
glass.
Alarms
erupted
overhead
at
earsplitting
decibel
levels.
"Give
me
the
soap!"
Sophie
yelled,
barely
audible
over
the
alarm.
Langdon
thrust
the
bar
into
her
hand.
Palming
the
soap,
she
peered
out
the
shattered
window
at
the
eighteen
wheeler
idling
below.
The
target
was
plenty
big
an
expansive,
stationary
tarp
and
it
was
less
than
ten
feet
from
the
side
of
the
building.
As
the
traffic
lights
prepared
to
change,
Sophie
took
a
deep
breath
and
lobbed
the
bar
of
soap
out
into
the
night.
The
soap
plummeted
downward
toward
the
truck,
landing
on
the
edge
of
the
tarp,
and
sliding
downward
into
the
cargo
bay
just
as
the
traffic
light
turned
green.
"Congratulations,"
Sophie
said,
dragging
him
toward
the
door.
"You
just
escaped
from
the
Louvre."
Fleeing
the
men's
room,
they
moved
into
the
shadows
just
as
Fache
rushed
past.
Now,
with
the
fire
alarm
silenced,
Langdon
could
hear
the
sounds
of
DCPJ
sirens
tearing
away
from
the
Louvre.
A
police
exodus.
Fache
had
hurried
off
as
well,
leaving
the
Grand
Gallery
deserted.
"There's
an
emergency
stairwell
about
fifty
meters
back
into
the
Grand
Gallery,"
Sophie
said.
"Now
that
the
guards
are
leaving
the
perimeter,
we
can
get
out
of
here."
Langdon
decided
not
to
say
another
word
all
evening.
Sophie
Neveu
was
clearly
a
hell
of
a
lot
smarter
than
he
was.
The
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice,
it
is
said,
has
the
most
eccentric
history
of
any
building
in
Paris.
Built
over
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
temple
to
the
Egyptian
goddess
Isis,
the
church
possesses
an
architectural
footprint
matching
that
of
Notre
Dame
to
within
inches.
The
sanctuary
has
played
host
to
the
baptisms
of
the
Marquis
de
Sade
and
Baudelaire,
as
well
as
the
marriage
of
Victor
Hugo.
The
attached
seminary
has
a
well
documented
history
of
unorthodoxy
and
was
once
the
clandestine
meeting
hall
for
numerous
secret
societies.
Tonight,
the
cavernous
nave
of
Saint
Sulpice
was
as
silent
as
a
tomb,
the
only
hint
of
life
the
faint
smell
of
incense
from
mass
earlier
that
evening.
Silas
sensed
an
uneasiness
in
Sister
Sandrine's
demeanor
as
she
led
him
into
the
sanctuary.
He
was
not
surprised
by
this.
Silas
was
accustomed
to
people
being
uncomfortable
with
his
appearance.
"You're
an
American,"
she
said.
"French
by
birth,"
Silas
responded.
"I
had
my
calling
in
Spain,
and
I
now
study
in
the
United
States."
Sister
Sandrine
nodded.
She
was
a
small
woman
with
quiet
eyes.
"And
you
have
never
seen
Saint
Sulpice?"
"I
realize
this
is
almost
a
sin
in
itself."
"She
is
more
beautiful
by
day."
"I
am
certain.
Nonetheless,
I
am
grateful
that
you
would
provide
me
this
opportunity
tonight."
"The
abbe
requested
it.
You
obviously
have
powerful
friends."
You
have
no
idea,
Silas
thought.
As
he
followed
Sister
Sandrine
down
the
main
aisle,
Silas
was
surprised
by
the
austerity
of
the
sanctuary.
Unlike
Notre
Dame
with
its
colorful
frescoes,
gilded
altar
work,
and
warm
wood,
Saint
Sulpice
was
stark
and
cold,
conveying
an
almost
barren
quality
reminiscent
of
the
ascetic
cathedrals
of
Spain.
The
lack
of
decor
made
the
interior
look
even
more
expansive,
and
as
Silas
gazed
up
into
the
soaring
ribbed
vault
of
the
ceiling,
he
imagined
he
was
standing
beneath
the
hull
of
an
enormous
overturned
ship.
A
fitting
image,
he
thought.
The
brotherhood's
ship
was
about
to
be
capsized
forever.
Feeling
eager
to
get
to
work,
Silas
wished
Sister
Sandrine
would
leave
him.
She
was
a
small
woman
whom
Silas
could
incapacitate
easily,
but
he
had
vowed
not
to
use
force
unless
absolutely
necessary.
She
is
a
woman
of
the
cloth,
and
it
is
not
her
fault
the
brotherhood
chose
her
church
as
a
hiding
place
for
their
keystone.
She
should
not
be
punished
for
the
sins
of
others.
"I
am
embarrassed,
Sister,
that
you
were
awoken
on
my
behalf."
"Not
at
all.
You
are
in
Paris
a
short
time.
You
should
not
miss
Saint
Sulpice.
Are
