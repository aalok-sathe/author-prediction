of
the
ordinary.
Not
on
the
floor,
on
the
walls,
or
even
on
the
canvas
itself.
There
must
be
something
here!
Sophie
felt
totally
certain
she
had
deciphered
her
grandfather's
intentions
correctly.
What
else
could
he
possibly
intend?
The
masterpiece
she
was
examining
was
a
five
foot
tall
canvas.
The
bizarre
scene
Da
Vinci
had
painted
included
an
awkwardly
posed
Virgin
Mary
sitting
with
Baby
Jesus,
John
the
Baptist,
and
the
Angel
Uriel
on
a
perilous
outcropping
of
rocks.
When
Sophie
was
a
little
girl,
no
trip
to
the
Mona
Lisa
had
been
complete
without
her
grandfather
dragging
her
across
the
room
to
see
this
second
painting.
Grand
pere,
I'm
here!
But
I
don
't
see
it!
Behind
her,
Sophie
could
hear
the
guard
trying
to
radio
again
for
help.
Think!
She
pictured
the
message
scrawled
on
the
protective
glass
of
the
Mona
Lisa.
So
dark
the
con
of
man.
The
painting
before
her
had
no
protective
glass
on
which
to
write
a
message,
and
Sophie
knew
her
grandfather
would
never
have
defaced
this
masterpiece
by
writing
on
the
painting
itself.
She
paused.
At
least
not
on
the
front.
Her
eyes
shot
upward,
climbing
the
long
cables
that
dangled
from
the
ceiling
to
support
the
canvas.
Could
that
be
it?
Grabbing
the
left
side
of
the
carved
wood
frame,
she
pulled
it
toward
her.
The
painting
was
large
and
the
backing
flexed
as
she
swung
it
away
from
the
wall.
Sophie
slipped
her
head
and
shoulders
in
behind
the
painting
and
raised
the
black
light
to
inspect
the
back.
It
took
only
seconds
to
realize
her
instinct
had
been
wrong.
The
back
of
the
painting
was
pale
and
blank.
There
was
no
purple
text
here,
only
the
mottled
brown
backside
of
aging
canvas
and
Wait.
Sophie's
eyes
locked
on
an
incongruous
glint
of
lustrous
metal
lodged
near
the
bottom
edge
of
the
frame's
wooden
armature.
The
object
was
small,
partially
wedged
in
the
slit
where
the
canvas
met
the
frame.
A
shimmering
gold
chain
dangled
off
it.
To
Sophie's
utter
amazement,
the
chain
was
affixed
to
a
familiar
gold
key.
The
broad,
sculpted
head
was
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
and
bore
an
engraved
seal
she
had
not
seen
since
she
was
nine
years
old.
A
fleur
de
lis
with
the
initials
P.S.
In
that
instant,
Sophie
felt
the
ghost
of
her
grandfather
whispering
in
her
ear.
When
the
time
comes,
the
key
will
be
yours.
A
tightness
gripped
her
throat
as
she
realized
that
her
grandfather,
even
in
death,
had
kept
his
promise.
This
key
opens
a
box,
his
voice
was
saying,
where
I
keep
many
secrets.
Sophie
now
realized
that
the
entire
purpose
of
tonight's
word
game
had
been
this
key.
Her
grandfather
had
it
with
him
when
he
was
killed.
Not
wanting
it
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
police,
he
hid
it
behind
this
painting.
Then
he
devised
an
ingenious
treasure
hunt
to
ensure
only
Sophie
would
find
it.
"Au
secours!"
the
guard's
voice
yelled.
Sophie
snatched
the
key
from
behind
the
painting
and
slipped
it
deep
in
her
pocket
along
with
the
UV
penlight.
Peering
out
from
behind
the
canvas,
she
could
see
the
guard
was
still
trying
desperately
to
raise
someone
on
the
walkie
talkie.
He
was
backing
toward
the
entrance,
still
aiming
the
gun
firmly
at
Langdon.
"Au
secours!"
he
shouted
again
into
his
radio.
Static.
He
can
't
transmit,
Sophie
realized,
recalling
that
tourists
with
cell
phones
often
got
frustrated
in
here
when
they
tried
to
call
home
to
brag
about
seeing
the
Mona
Lisa.
The
extra
surveillance
wiring
in
the
walls
made
it
virtually
impossible
to
get
a
carrier
unless
you
stepped
out
into
the
hall.
The
guard
was
backing
quickly
toward
the
exit
now,
and
Sophie
knew
she
had
to
act
immediately.
Gazing
up
at
the
large
painting
behind
which
she
was
partially
ensconced,
Sophie
realized
that
Leonardo
da
Vinci,
for
the
second
time
tonight,
was
there
to
help.
Another
few
meters,
Grouard
told
himself,
keeping
his
gun
leveled.
"Arretez!
Ouje
la
detruis!"
the
woman's
voice
echoed
across
the
room.
Grouard
glanced
over
and
stopped
in
his
tracks.
"Mon
dieu,
non!"
Through
the
reddish
haze,
he
could
see
that
the
woman
had
actually
lifted
the
large
painting
off
its
cables
and
propped
it
on
the
floor
in
front
of
her.
At
five
feet
tall,
the
canvas
almost
entirely
hid
her
body.
Grouard's
first
thought
was
to
wonder
why
the
painting's
trip
wires
hadn't
set
off
alarms,
but
of
course
the
artwork
cable
sensors
had
yet
to
be
reset
tonight.
What
is
she
doing!
When
he
saw
it,
his
blood
went
cold.
The
canvas
started
to
bulge
in
the
middle,
the
fragile
outlines
of
the
Virgin
Mary,
Baby
Jesus,
and
John
the
Baptist
beginning
to
distort.
"Non!"
Grouard
screamed,
frozen
in
horror
as
he
watched
the
priceless
Da
Vinci
stretching.
The
woman
was
pushing
her
knee
into
the
center
of
the
canvas
from
behind!
"NON!"
Grouard
wheeled
and
aimed
his
gun
at
her
but
instantly
realized
it
was
an
empty
threat.
The
canvas
was
only
fabric,
but
it
was
utterly
impenetrable
a
six
million
dollar
piece
of
body
armor.
can
't
put
a
bullet
through
a
Da
Vinci!
"Set
down
your
gun
and
radio,"
the
woman
said
in
calm
French,
"or
I'll
put
my
knee
through
this
painting.
I
think
you
know
how
my
grandfather
would
feel
about
that."
Grouard
felt
dizzy.
"Please
no.
That's
Madonna
of
the
Rocks!"
He
dropped
his
gun
and
radio,
raising
his
hands
over
his
head.
"Thank
you,"
the
woman
said.
"Now
do
exactly
as
I
tell
you,
and
everything
will
work
out
fine."
Moments
later,
Langdon's
pulse
was
still
thundering
as
he
ran
beside
Sophie
down
the
emergency
stairwell
toward
the
ground
level.
Neither
of
them
had
said
a
word
since
leaving
the
trembling
Louvre
guard
lying
in
the
Salle
des
Etats.
The
guard's
pistol
was
now
clutched
tightly
in
Langdon's
hands,
and
he
couldn't
wait
to
get
rid
of
it.
The
weapon
