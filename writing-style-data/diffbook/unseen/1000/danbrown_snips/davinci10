found
the
Grand
Gallery
sealed.
Through
the
gate,
they
could
hear
someone
moving
around
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor,
but
they
could
not
see
who
it
was.
They
shouted,
but
they
got
no
answer.
Assuming
it
could
only
be
a
criminal,
they
followed
protocol
and
called
in
the
Judicial
Police.
We
took
up
positions
within
fifteen
minutes.
When
we
arrived,
we
raised
the
barricade
enough
to
slip
underneath,
and
I
sent
a
dozen
armed
agents
inside.
They
swept
the
length
of
the
gallery
to
corner
the
intruder."
"And?"
"They
found
no
one
inside.
Except"
He
pointed
farther
down
the
hall.
"Him."
Langdon
lifted
his
gaze
and
followed
Fache's
outstretched
finger.
At
first
he
thought
Fache
was
pointing
to
a
large
marble
statue
in
the
middle
of
the
hallway.
As
they
continued,
though,
Langdon
began
to
see
past
the
statue.
Thirty
yards
down
the
hall,
a
single
spotlight
on
a
portable
pole
stand
shone
down
on
the
floor,
creating
a
stark
island
of
white
light
in
the
dark
crimson
gallery.
In
the
center
of
the
light,
like
an
insect
under
a
microscope,
the
corpse
of
the
curator
lay
naked
on
the
parquet
floor.
"You
saw
the
photograph,"
Fache
said,
"so
this
should
be
of
no
surprise."
Langdon
felt
a
deep
chill
as
they
approached
the
body.
Before
him
was
one
of
the
strangest
images
he
had
ever
seen.
The
pallid
corpse
of
Jacques
Sauniere
lay
on
the
parquet
floor
exactly
as
it
appeared
in
the
photograph.
As
Langdon
stood
over
the
body
and
squinted
in
the
harsh
light,
he
reminded
himself
to
his
amazement
that
Sauniere
had
spent
his
last
minutes
of
life
arranging
his
own
body
in
this
strange
fashion.
Sauniere
looked
remarkably
fit
for
a
man
of
his
years
and
all
of
his
musculature
was
in
plain
view.
He
had
stripped
off
every
shred
of
clothing,
placed
it
neatly
on
the
floor,
and
laid
down
on
his
back
in
the
center
of
the
wide
corridor,
perfectly
aligned
with
the
long
axis
of
the
room.
His
arms
and
legs
were
sprawled
outward
in
a
wide
spread
eagle,
like
those
of
a
child
making
a
snow
angel
or,
perhaps
more
appropriately,
like
a
man
being
drawn
and
quartered
by
some
invisible
force.
Just
below
Sauniere's
breastbone,
a
bloody
smear
marked
the
spot
where
the
bullet
had
pierced
his
flesh.
The
wound
had
bled
surprisingly
little,
leaving
only
a
small
pool
of
blackened
blood.
Sauniere's
left
index
finger
was
also
bloody,
apparently
having
been
dipped
into
the
wound
to
create
the
most
unsettling
aspect
of
his
own
macabre
deathbed;
using
his
own
blood
as
ink,
and
employing
his
own
naked
abdomen
as
a
canvas,
Sauniere
had
drawn
a
simple
symbol
on
his
flesh
five
straight
lines
that
intersected
to
form
a
five
pointed
star.
The
pentacle.
The
bloody
star,
centered
on
Sauniere's
navel,
gave
his
corpse
a
distinctly
ghoulish
aura.
The
photo
Langdon
had
seen
was
chilling
enough,
but
now,
witnessing
the
scene
in
person,
Langdon
felt
a
deepening
uneasiness.
He
did
this
to
himself.
"Mr.
Langdon?"
Fache's
dark
eyes
settled
on
him
again.
"It's
a
pentacle,"
Langdon
offered,
his
voice
feeling
hollow
in
the
huge
space.
"One
of
the
oldest
symbols
on
earth.
Used
over
four
thousand
years
before
Christ."
"And
what
does
it
mean?"
Langdon
always
hesitated
when
he
got
this
question.
Telling
someone
what
a
symbol
"meant"
was
like
telling
them
how
a
song
should
make
them
feel
it
was
different
for
all
people.
A
white
Ku
Klux
Klan
headpiece
conjured
images
of
hatred
and
racism
in
the
United
States,
and
yet
the
same
costume
carried
a
meaning
of
religious
faith
in
Spain.
"Symbols
carry
different
meanings
in
different
settings,"
Langdon
said.
"Primarily,
the
pentacle
is
a
pagan
religious
symbol."
Fache
nodded.
"Devil
worship."
"No,"
Langdon
corrected,
immediately
realizing
his
choice
of
vocabulary
should
have
been
clearer.
Nowadays,
the
term
pagan
had
become
almost
synonymous
with
devil
worship
a
gross
misconception.
The
word's
roots
actually
reached
back
to
the
Latin
paganus,
meaning
country
dwellers.
"Pagans"
were
literally
unindoctrinated
country
folk
who
clung
to
the
old,
rural
religions
of
Nature
worship.
In
fact,
so
strong
was
the
Church's
fear
of
those
who
lived
in
the
rural
villes
that
the
once
innocuous
word
for
"villager"
villain
came
to
mean
a
wicked
soul.
"The
pentacle,"
Langdon
clarified,
"is
a
pre
Christian
symbol
that
relates
to
Nature
worship.
The
ancients
envisioned
their
world
in
two
halves
masculine
and
feminine.
Their
gods
and
goddesses
worked
to
keep
a
balance
of
power.
Yin
and
yang.
When
male
and
female
were
balanced,
there
was
harmony
in
the
world.
When
they
were
unbalanced,
there
was
chaos."
Langdon
motioned
to
Sauniere's
stomach.
"This
pentacle
is
representative
of
the
female
half
of
all
things
a
concept
religious
historians
call
the
'sacred
feminine'
or
the
'divine
goddess.'
Sauniere,
of
all
people,
would
know
this."
"Sauniere
drew
a
goddess
symbol
on
his
stomach?"
Langdon
had
to
admit,
it
seemed
odd.
"In
its
most
specific
interpretation,
the
pentacle
symbolizes
Venus
the
goddess
of
female
sexual
love
and
beauty."
Fache
eyed
the
naked
man,
and
grunted.
"Early
religion
was
based
on
the
divine
order
of
Nature.
The
goddess
Venus
and
the
planet
Venus
were
one
and
the
same.
The
goddess
had
a
place
in
the
nighttime
sky
and
was
known
by
many
names
Venus,
the
Eastern
Star,
Ishtar,
Astarte
all
of
them
powerful
female
concepts
with
ties
to
Nature
and
Mother
Earth.
Fache
looked
more
troubled
now,
as
if
he
somehow
preferred
the
idea
of
devil
worship.
Langdon
decided
not
to
share
the
pentacle's
most
astonishing
property
the
graphic
origin
of
its
ties
to
Venus.
As
a
young
astronomy
student,
Langdon
had
been
stunned
to
learn
the
planet
Venus
traced
a
perfect
pentacle
across
the
ecliptic
sky
every
four
years.
So
astonished
were
the
ancients
to
observe
this
phenomenon,
that
Venus
and
her
pentacle
became
symbols
of
perfection,
beauty,
and
the
cyclic
qualities
of
sexual
love.
As
a
tribute
to
the
magic
of
Venus,
the
Greeks
used
her
four
year
cycle
