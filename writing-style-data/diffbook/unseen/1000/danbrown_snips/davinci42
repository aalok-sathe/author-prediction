was
interesting."
Sophie
didn't
seem
to
hear.
Her
eyes
remained
fixed
ahead
down
the
long
thoroughfare
of
Champs
Elysees,
the
two
mile
stretch
of
posh
storefronts
that
was
often
called
the
Fifth
Avenue
of
Paris.
The
embassy
was
only
about
a
mile
away,
and
Langdon
settled
into
his
seat.
So
dark
the
con
of
man.
Sophie's
quick
thinking
had
been
impressive.
Madonna
of
the
Rocks.
Sophie
had
said
her
grandfather
left
her
something
behind
the
painting.
A
final
message?
Langdon
could
not
help
but
marvel
over
Sauniere's
brilliant
hiding
place;
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
was
yet
another
fitting
link
in
the
evening's
chain
of
interconnected
symbolism.
Sauniere,
it
seemed,
at
every
turn,
was
reinforcing
his
fondness
for
the
dark
and
mischievous
side
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
Da
Vinci's
original
commission
for
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
had
come
from
an
organization
known
as
the
Confraternity
of
the
Immaculate
Conception,
which
needed
a
painting
for
the
centerpiece
of
an
altar
triptych
in
their
church
of
San
Francesco
in
Milan.
The
nuns
gave
Leonardo
specific
dimensions,
and
the
desired
theme
for
the
painting
the
Virgin
Mary,
baby
John
the
Baptist,
Uriel,
and
Baby
Jesus
sheltering
in
a
cave.
Although
Da
Vinci
did
as
they
requested,
when
he
delivered
the
work,
the
group
reacted
with
horror.
He
had
filled
the
painting
with
explosive
and
disturbing
details.
The
painting
showed
a
blue
robed
Virgin
Mary
sitting
with
her
arm
around
an
infant
child,
presumably
Baby
Jesus.
Opposite
Mary
sat
Uriel,
also
with
an
infant,
presumably
baby
John
the
Baptist.
Oddly,
though,
rather
than
the
usual
Jesus
blessing
John
scenario,
it
was
baby
John
who
was
blessing
Jesus
and
Jesus
was
submitting
to
his
authority!
More
troubling
still,
Mary
was
holding
one
hand
high
above
the
head
of
infant
John
and
making
a
decidedly
threatening
gesture
her
fingers
looking
like
eagle's
talons,
gripping
an
invisible
head.
Finally,
the
most
obvious
and
frightening
image:
Just
below
Mary's
curled
fingers,
Uriel
was
making
a
cutting
gesture
with
his
hand
as
if
slicing
the
neck
of
the
invisible
head
gripped
by
Mary's
claw
like
hand.
Langdon's
students
were
always
amused
to
learn
that
Da
Vinci
eventually
mollified
the
confraternity
by
painting
them
a
second,
"watered
down"
version
of
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
in
which
everyone
was
arranged
in
a
more
orthodox
manner.
The
second
version
now
hung
in
London's
National
Gallery
under
the
name
Virgin
of
the
Rocks,
although
Langdon
still
preferred
the
Louvre's
more
intriguing
original.
As
Sophie
gunned
the
car
up
Champs
Elysees,
Langdon
said,
"The
painting.
What
was
behind
it?"
Her
eyes
remained
on
the
road.
"I'll
show
you
once
we're
safely
inside
the
embassy."
"You'll
show
it
to
me?"
Langdon
was
surprised.
"He
left
you
a
physical
object?"
Sophie
gave
a
curt
nod.
"Embossed
with
a
fleur
de
lis
and
the
initials
P.S."
Langdon
couldn't
believe
his
ears.
We're
going
to
make
it,
Sophie
thought
as
she
swung
the
SmartCar's
wheel
to
the
right,
cutting
sharply
past
the
luxurious
Hotel
de
Crillon
into
Paris's
tree
lined
diplomatic
neighborhood.
The
embassy
was
less
than
a
mile
away
now.
She
was
finally
feeling
like
she
could
breathe
normally
again.
Even
as
she
drove,
Sophie's
mind
remained
locked
on
the
key
in
her
pocket,
her
memories
of
seeing
it
many
years
ago,
the
gold
head
shaped
as
an
equal
armed
cross,
the
triangular
shaft,
the
indentations,
the
embossed
flowery
seal,
and
the
letters
P.S.
Although
the
key
barely
had
entered
Sophie's
thoughts
through
the
years,
her
work
in
the
intelligence
community
had
taught
her
plenty
about
security,
and
now
the
key's
peculiar
tooling
no
longer
looked
so
mystifying.
A
laser
tooled
varying
matrix.
Impossible
to
duplicate.
Rather
than
teeth
that
moved
tumblers,
this
key's
complex
series
of
laser
burned
pockmarks
was
examined
by
an
electric
eye.
If
the
eye
determined
that
the
hexagonal
pockmarks
were
correctly
spaced,
arranged,
and
rotated,
then
the
lock
would
open.
Sophie
could
not
begin
to
imagine
what
a
key
like
this
opened,
but
she
sensed
Robert
would
be
able
to
tell
her.
After
all,
he
had
described
the
key's
embossed
seal
without
ever
seeing
it.
The
cruciform
on
top
implied
the
key
belonged
to
some
kind
of
Christian
organization,
and
yet
Sophie
knew
of
no
churches
that
used
laser
tooled
varying
matrix
keys.
Besides,
my
grandfather
was
no
Christian.
Sophie
had
witnessed
proof
of
that
ten
years
ago.
Ironically,
it
had
been
another
key
a
far
more
normal
one
that
had
revealed
his
true
nature
to
her.
The
afternoon
had
been
warm
when
she
landed
at
Charles
de
Gaulle
Airport
and
hailed
a
taxi
home.
Grand
pere
will
be
so
surprised
to
see
me,
she
thought.
Returning
from
graduate
school
in
Britain
for
spring
break
a
few
days
early,
Sophie
couldn't
wait
to
see
him
and
tell
him
all
about
the
encryption
methods
she
was
studying.
When
she
arrived
at
their
Paris
home,
however,
her
grandfather
was
not
there.
Disappointed,
she
knew
he
had
not
been
expecting
her
and
was
probably
working
at
the
Louvre.
But
it's
Saturday
afternoon,
she
realized.
He
seldom
worked
on
weekends.
On
weekends,
he
usually
Grinning,
Sophie
ran
out
to
the
garage.
Sure
enough,
his
car
was
gone.
It
was
the
weekend.
Jacques
Sauniere
despised
city
driving
and
owned
a
car
for
one
destination
only
his
vacation
chateau
in
Normandy,
north
of
Paris.
Sophie,
after
months
in
the
congestion
of
London,
was
eager
for
the
smells
of
nature
and
to
start
her
vacation
right
away.
It
was
still
early
evening,
and
she
decided
to
leave
immediately
and
surprise
him.
Borrowing
a
friend's
car,
Sophie
drove
north,
winding
into
the
deserted
moon
swept
hills
near
Creully.
She
arrived
just
after
ten
o'clock,
turning
down
the
long
private
driveway
toward
her
grandfather's
retreat.
The
access
road
was
over
a
mile
long,
and
she
was
halfway
down
it
before
she
could
start
to
see
the
house
through
the
trees
a
mammoth,
old
stone
chateau
nestled
in
the
woods
on
the
side
of
a
hill.
Sophie
had
half
expected
to
find
her
