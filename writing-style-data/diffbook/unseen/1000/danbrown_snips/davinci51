"
Sophie
demanded.
The
trembling
driver
kept
his
arms
over
his
head
as
he
got
out
of
his
taxi
and
took
several
steps
backward.
Sophie
had
rolled
down
her
window
and
now
aimed
the
gun
outside
at
the
bewildered
cabbie.
"Robert,"
she
said
quietly,
"take
the
wheel.
You're
driving."
Langdon
was
not
about
to
argue
with
a
woman
wielding
a
gun.
He
climbed
out
of
the
car
and
jumped
back
in
behind
the
wheel.
The
driver
was
yelling
curses,
his
arms
still
raised
over
his
head.
"Robert,"
Sophie
said
from
the
back
seat,
"I
trust
you've
seen
enough
of
our
magic
forest?"
He
nodded.
Plenty.
"Good.
Drive
us
out
of
here."
Langdon
looked
down
at
the
car's
controls
and
hesitated.
Shit.
He
groped
for
the
stick
shift
and
clutch.
"Sophie?
Maybe
you
"Go!"
she
yelled.
Outside,
several
hookers
were
walking
over
to
see
what
was
going
on.
One
woman
was
placing
a
call
on
her
cell
phone.
Langdon
depressed
the
clutch
and
jostled
the
stick
into
what
he
hoped
was
first
gear.
He
touched
the
accelerator,
testing
the
gas.
Langdon
popped
the
clutch.
The
tires
howled
as
the
taxi
leapt
forward,
fishtailing
wildly
and
sending
the
gathering
crowd
diving
for
cover.
The
woman
with
the
cell
phone
leapt
into
the
woods,
only
narrowly
avoiding
being
run
down.
"Doucement!"
Sophie
said,
as
the
car
lurched
down
the
road.
"What
are
you
doing?"
"I
tried
to
warn
you,"
he
shouted
over
the
sound
of
gnashing
gears.
"I
drive
an
automatic!"
Although
the
spartan
room
in
the
brownstone
on
Rue
La
Bruyere
had
witnessed
a
lot
of
suffering,
Silas
doubted
anything
could
match
the
anguish
now
gripping
his
pale
body.
was
deceived.
Everything
is
lost.
Silas
had
been
tricked.
The
brothers
had
lied,
choosing
death
instead
of
revealing
their
true
secret.
Silas
did
not
have
the
strength
to
call
the
Teacher.
Not
only
had
Silas
killed
the
only
four
people
who
knew
where
the
keystone
was
hidden,
he
had
killed
a
nun
inside
Saint
Sulpice.
She
was
working
against
God!
She
scorned
the
work
of
Opus
Dei!
A
crime
of
impulse,
the
woman's
death
complicated
matters
greatly.
Bishop
Aringarosa
had
placed
the
phone
call
that
got
Silas
into
Saint
Sulpice;
what
would
the
abbe
think
when
he
discovered
the
nun
was
dead?
Although
Silas
had
placed
her
back
in
her
bed,
the
wound
on
her
head
was
obvious.
Silas
had
attempted
to
replace
the
broken
tiles
in
the
floor,
but
that
damage
too
was
obvious.
They
would
know
someone
had
been
there.
Silas
had
planned
to
hide
within
Opus
Dei
when
his
task
here
was
complete.
Bishop
Aringarosa
will
protect
me.
Silas
could
imagine
no
more
blissful
existence
than
a
life
of
meditation
and
prayer
deep
within
the
walls
of
Opus
Dei's
headquarters
in
New
York
City.
He
would
never
again
set
foot
outside.
Everything
he
needed
was
within
that
sanctuary.
Nobody
will
miss
me.
Unfortunately,
Silas
knew,
a
prominent
man
like
Bishop
Aringarosa
could
not
disappear
so
easily.
have
endangered
the
bishop.
Silas
gazed
blankly
at
the
floor
and
pondered
taking
his
own
life.
After
all,
it
had
been
Aringarosa
who
gave
Silas
life
in
the
first
place
in
that
small
rectory
in
Spain,
educating
him,
giving
him
purpose.
"My
friend,"
Aringarosa
had
told
him,
"you
were
born
an
albino.
Do
not
let
others
shame
you
for
this.
Do
you
not
understand
how
special
this
makes
you?
Were
you
not
aware
that
Noah
himself
was
an
albino?"
"Noah
of
the
Ark?"
Silas
had
never
heard
this.
Aringarosa
was
smiling.
"Indeed,
Noah
of
the
Ark.
An
albino.
Like
you,
he
had
skin
white
like
an
angel.
Consider
this.
Noah
saved
all
of
life
on
the
planet.
You
are
destined
for
great
things,
Silas.
The
Lord
has
freed
you
for
a
reason.
You
have
your
calling.
The
Lord
needs
your
help
to
do
His
work."
Over
time,
Silas
learned
to
see
himself
in
a
new
light.
am
pure.
White.
Beautiful.
Like
an
angel.
At
the
moment,
though,
in
his
room
at
the
residence
hall,
it
was
his
father's
disappointed
voice
that
whispered
to
him
from
the
past.
Tu
es
un
desastre.
Un
spectre.
Kneeling
on
the
wooden
floor,
Silas
prayed
for
forgiveness.
Then,
stripping
off
his
robe,
he
reached
again
for
the
Discipline.
Struggling
with
the
gear
shift,
Langdon
managed
to
maneuver
the
hijacked
taxi
to
the
far
side
of
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
while
stalling
only
twice.
Unfortunately,
the
inherent
humor
in
the
situation
was
overshadowed
by
the
taxi
dispatcher
repeatedly
hailing
their
cab
over
the
radio.
"Voiture
cinq
six
trois.
Oil
etes
vous?
Repondez!"
When
Langdon
reached
the
exit
of
the
park,
he
swallowed
his
machismo
and
jammed
on
the
brakes.
"You'd
better
drive."
Sophie
looked
relieved
as
she
jumped
behind
the
wheel.
Within
seconds
she
had
the
car
humming
smoothly
westward
along
Allee
de
Longchamp,
leaving
the
Garden
of
Earthly
Delights
behind.
"Which
way
is
Rue
Haxo?"
Langdon
asked,
watching
Sophie
edge
the
speedometer
over
a
hundred
kilometers
an
hour.
Sophie's
eyes
remained
focused
on
the
road.
"The
cab
driver
said
it's
adjacent
to
the
Roland
Garros
tennis
stadium.
I
know
that
area."
Langdon
pulled
the
heavy
key
from
his
pocket
again,
feeling
the
weight
in
his
palm.
He
sensed
it
was
an
object
of
enormous
consequence.
Quite
possibly
the
key
to
his
own
freedom.
Earlier,
while
telling
Sophie
about
the
Knights
Templar,
Langdon
had
realized
that
this
key,
in
addition
to
having
the
Priory
seal
embossed
on
it,
possessed
a
more
subtle
tie
to
the
Priory
of
Sion.
The
equal
armed
cruciform
was
symbolic
of
balance
and
harmony
but
also
of
the
Knights
Templar.
Everyone
had
seen
the
paintings
of
Knights
Templar
wearing
white
tunics
emblazoned
with
red
equal
armed
crosses.
Granted,
the
arms
of
the
Templar
cross
were
slightly
flared
at
the
ends,
but
they
were
still
of
equal
length.
A
square
cross.
Just
like
the
one
on
this
key.
Langdon
felt
his
imagination
starting
to
run
wild
as
he
fantasized
about
what
they
might
find.
The
Holy
Grail.
