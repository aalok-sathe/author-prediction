moved
smoothly.
She
aligned
the
disks
such
that
her
chosen
letters
lined
up
between
the
cryptex's
two
brass
alignment
arrows
on
either
end
of
the
cylinder.
The
dials
now
spelled
a
five
letter
word
that
Sophie
knew
was
absurdly
obvious.
G

L.
Gently,
she
held
the
two
ends
of
the
cylinder
and
pulled,
applying
pressure
slowly.
The
cryptex
didn't
budge.
She
heard
the
vinegar
inside
gurgle
and
stopped
pulling.
Then
she
tried
again.

Again,
no

Nothing.
The
cryptex
remained
locked
solid.
Frowning,
she
replaced
it
in
the
rosewood
box
and
closed
the
lid.
Looking
outside
at
Langdon,
Sophie
felt
grateful
he
was
with
her
tonight.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Her
grandfather's
rationale
for
including
him
was
now
clear.
Sophie
was
not
equipped
to
understand
her
grandfather's
intentions,
and
so
he
had
assigned
Robert
Langdon
as
her
guide.
A
tutor
to
oversee
her
education.
Unfortunately
for
Langdon,
he
had
turned
out
to
be
far
more
than
a
tutor
tonight.
He
had
become
the
target
of
Bezu
Fache
and
some
unseen
force
intent
on
possessing
the
Holy
Grail.
Whatever
the
Grail
turns
out
to
be.
Sophie
wondered
if
finding
out
was
worth
her
life.
As
the
armored
truck
accelerated
again,
Langdon
was
pleased
how
much
more
smoothly
it
drove.
"Do
you
know
how
to
get
to
Versailles?"
Sophie
eyed
him.
"Sightseeing?"
"No,
I
have
a
plan.
There's
a
religious
historian
I
know
who
lives
near
Versailles.
I
can't
remember
exactly
where,
but
we
can
look
it
up.
I've
been
to
his
estate
a
few
times.
His
name
is
Leigh
Teabing.
He's
a
former
British
Royal
Historian."
"And
he
lives
in
Paris?"
"Teabing's
life
passion
is
the
Grail.
When
whisperings
of
the
Priory
keystone
surfaced
about
fifteen
years
ago,
he
moved
to
France
to
search
churches
in
hopes
of
finding
it.
He's
written
some
books
on
the
keystone
and
the
Grail.
He
may
be
able
to
help
us
figure
out
how
to
open
it
and
what
to
do
with
it."
Sophie's
eyes
were
wary.
"Can
you
trust
him?"
"Trust
him
to
what?
Not
steal
the
information?"
"And
not
to
turn
us
in."
"I
don't
intend
to
tell
him
we're
wanted
by
the
police.
I'm
hoping
he'll
take
us
in
until
we
can
sort
all
this
out."
"Robert,
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
every
television
in
France
is
probably
getting
ready
to
broadcast
our
pictures?
Bezu
Fache
always
uses
the
media
to
his
advantage.
He'll
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
move
around
without
being
recognized."
Terrific,
Langdon
thought.
My
French
TV
debut
will
be
on
"Paris
's
Most
Wanted.
"
At
least
Jonas
Faukman
would
be
pleased;
every
time
Langdon
made
the
news,
his
book
sales
jumped.
"Is
this
man
a
good
enough
friend?"
Sophie
asked.
Langdon
doubted
Teabing
was
someone
who
watched
television,
especially
at
this
hour,
but
still
the
question
deserved
consideration.
Instinct
told
Langdon
that
Teabing
would
be
totally
trustworthy.
An
ideal
safe
harbor.
Considering
the
circumstances,
Teabing
would
probably
trip
over
himself
to
help
them
as
much
as
possible.
Not
only
did
he
owe
Langdon
a
favor,
but
Teabing
was
a
Grail
researcher,
and
Sophie
claimed
her
grandfather
was
the
actual
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion.
If
Teabing
heard
that,
he
would
salivate
at
the
thought
of
helping
them
figure
this
out.
"Teabing
could
be
a
powerful
ally,"
Langdon
said.
Depending
on
how
much
you
want
to
tell
him.
"Fache
probably
will
be
offering
a
monetary
reward."
Langdon
laughed.
"Believe
me,
money
is
the
last
thing
this
guy
needs."
Leigh
Teabing
was
wealthy
in
the
way
small
countries
were
wealthy.
A
descendant
of
Britain's
First
Duke
of
Lancaster,
Teabing
had
gotten
his
money
the
old
fashioned
way
he'd
inherited
it.
His
estate
outside
of
Paris
was
a
seventeenth
century
palace
with
two
private
lakes.
Langdon
had
first
met
Teabing
several
years
ago
through
the
British
Broadcasting
Corporation.
Teabing
had
approached
the
BBC
with
a
proposal
for
a
historical
documentary
in
which
he
would
expose
the
explosive
history
of
the
Holy
Grail
to
a
mainstream
television
audience.
The
BBC
producers
loved
Teabing's
hot
premise,
his
research,
and
his
credentials,
but
they
had
concerns
that
the
concept
was
so
shocking
and
hard
to
swallow
that
the
network
might
end
up
tarnishing
its
reputation
for
quality
journalism.
At
Teabing's
suggestion,
the
BBC
solved
its
credibility
fears
by
soliciting
three
cameos
from
respected
historians
from
around
the
world,
all
of
whom
corroborated
the
stunning
nature
of
the
Holy
Grail
secret
with
their
own
research.
Langdon
had
been
among
those
chosen.
The
BBC
had
flown
Langdon
to
Teabing's
Paris
estate
for
the
filming.
He
sat
before
cameras
in
Teabing's
opulent
drawing
room
and
shared
his
story,
admitting
his
initial
skepticism
on
hearing
of
the
alternate
Holy
Grail
story,
then
describing
how
years
of
research
had
persuaded
him
that
the
story
was
true.
Finally,
Langdon
offered
some
of
his
own
research
a
series
of
symbologic
connections
that
strongly
supported
the
seemingly
controversial
claims.
When
the
program
aired
in
Britain,
despite
its
ensemble
cast
and
well
documented
evidence,
the
premise
rubbed
so
hard
against
the
grain
of
popular
Christian
thought
that
it
instantly
confronted
a
firestorm
of
hostility.
It
never
aired
in
the
States,
but
the
repercussions
echoed
across
the
Atlantic.
Shortly
afterward,
Langdon
received
a
postcard
from
an
old
friend
the
Catholic
Bishop
of
Philadelphia.
The
card
simply
read:
Et
tu,
Robert?
"Robert,"
Sophie
asked,
"you're
certain
we
can
trust
this
man?"
"Absolutely.
We're
colleagues,
he
doesn't
need
money,
and
I
happen
to
know
he
despises
the
French
authorities.
The
French
government
taxes
him
at
absurd
rates
because
he
bought
a
historic
landmark.
He'll
be
in
no
hurry
to
cooperate
with
Fache."
Sophie
stared
out
at
the
dark
roadway.
"If
we
go
to
him,
how
much
do
you
want
to
tell
him?"
Langdon
looked
unconcerned.
"Believe
me,
Leigh
Teabing
knows
more
about
the
Priory
of
Sion
and
the
Holy
Grail
than
anyone
on
earth.
Sophie
eyed
him.
