felt
intrigued
and
found
herself
pondering
the
verse
carefully.
"According
to
this
rhyme,
a
knight
did
something
that
incurred
displeasure
with
God,
and
yet
a
Pope
was
kind
enough
to
bury
him
in
London."
Langdon
nodded.
"Does
it
ring
any
bells?"
Gettum
moved
toward
one
of
the
workstations.
"Not
offhand,
but
let's
see
what
we
can
pull
up
in
the
database."
Over
the
past
two
decades,
King's
College
Research
Institute
in
Systematic
Theology
had
used
optical
character
recognition
software
in
unison
with
linguistic
translation
devices
to
digitize
and
catalog
an
enormous
collection
of
texts
encyclopedias
of
religion,
religious
biographies,
sacred
scriptures
in
dozens
of
languages,
histories,
Vatican
letters,
diaries
of
clerics,
anything
at
all
that
qualified
as
writings
on
human
spirituality.
Because
the
massive
collection
was
now
in
the
form
of
bits
and
bytes
rather
than
physical
pages,
the
data
was
infinitely
more
accessible.
Settling
into
one
of
the
workstations,
Gettum
eyed
the
slip
of
paper
and
began
typing.
"To
begin,
we'll
run
a
straight
Boolean
with
a
few
obvious
keywords
and
see
what
happens."
"Thank
you."
Gettum
typed
in
a
few
words:
LONDON,
KNIGHT,
POPE
As
she
clicked
the
SEARCH
button,
she
could
feel
the
hum
of
the
massive
mainframe
downstairs
scanning
data
at
a
rate
of
500
MBsec.
"I'm
asking
the
system
to
show
us
any
documents
whose
complete
text
contains
all
three
of
these
keywords.
We'll
get
more
hits
than
we
want,
but
it's
a
good
place
to
start.
The
screen
was
already
showing
the
first
of
the
hits
now.
Painting
the
Pope.
The
Collected
Portraits
of
Sir
Joshua
Reynolds.
London
University
Press.
Gettum
shook
her
head.
"Obviously
not
what
you're
looking
for."
She
scrolled
to
the
next
hit.
The
London
Writings
of
Alexander
Pope
by
G.
Wilson
Knight.
Again
she
shook
her
head.
As
the
system
churned
on,
the
hits
came
up
more
quickly
than
usual.
Dozens
of
texts
appeared,
many
of
them
referencing
the
eighteenth
century
British
writer
Alexander
Pope,
whose
counterreligious,
mock
epic
poetry
apparently
contained
plenty
of
references
to
knights
and
London.
Gettum
shot
a
quick
glance
to
the
numeric
field
at
the
bottom
of
the
screen.
This
computer,
by
calculating
the
current
number
of
hits
and
multiplying
by
the
percentage
of
the
database
left
to
search,
provided
a
rough
guess
of
how
much
information
would
be
found.
This
particular
search
looked
like
it
was
going
to
return
an
obscenely
large
amount
of
data.
Estimated
number
of
total
hits:
2,692
"We
need
to
refine
the
parameters
further,"
Gettum
said,
stopping
the
search.
"Is
this
all
the
information
you
have
regarding
the
tomb?
There's
nothing
else
to
go
on?"
Langdon
glanced
at
Sophie
Neveu,
looking
uncertain.
This
is
no
scavenger
hunt,
Gettum
sensed.
She
had
heard
the
whisperings
of
Robert
Langdon's
experience
in
Rome
last
year.
This
American
had
been
granted
access
to
the
most
secure
library
on
earth
the
Vatican
Secret
Archives.
She
wondered
what
kinds
of
secrets
Langdon
might
have
learned
inside
and
if
his
current
desperate
hunt
for
a
mysterious
London
tomb
might
relate
to
information
he
had
gained
within
the
Vatican.
Gettum
had
been
a
librarian
long
enough
to
know
the
most
common
reason
people
came
to
London
to
look
for
knights.
The
Grail.
Gettum
smiled
and
adjusted
her
glasses.
"You
are
friends
with
Leigh
Teabing,
you
are
in
England,
and
you
are
looking
for
a
knight."
She
folded
her
hands.
"I
can
only
assume
you
are
on
a
Grail
quest."
Langdon
and
Sophie
exchanged
startled
looks.
Gettum
laughed.
"My
friends,
this
library
is
a
base
camp
for
Grail
seekers.
Leigh
Teabing
among
them.
I
wish
I
had
a
shilling
for
every
time
I'd
run
searches
for
the
Rose,
Mary
Magdalene,
Sangreal,
Merovingian,
Priory
of
Sion,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
Everyone
loves
a
conspiracy."
She
took
off
her
glasses
and
eyed
them.
"I
need
more
information."
In
the
silence,
Gettum
sensed
her
guests'
desire
for
discretion
was
quickly
being
outweighed
by
their
eagerness
for
a
fast
result.
"Here,"
Sophie
Neveu
blurted.
"This
is
everything
we
know."
Borrowing
a
pen
from
Langdon,
she
wrote
two
more
lines
on
the
slip
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
Gettum.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
Gettum
gave
an
inward
smile.
The
Grail
indeed,
she
thought,
noting
the
references
to
the
Rose
and
her
seeded
womb.
"I
can
help
you,"
she
said,
looking
up
from
the
slip
of
paper.
"Might
I
ask
where
this
verse
came
from?
And
why
you
are
seeking
an
orb?"
"You
might
ask,"
Langdon
said,
with
a
friendly
smile,
"but
it's
a
long
story
and
we
have
very
little
time."
"Sounds
like
a
polite
way
of
saying
'mind
your
own
business.'
"We
would
be
forever
in
your
debt,
Pamela,"
Langdon
said,
"if
you
could
find
out
who
this
knight
is
and
where
he
is
buried."
"Very
well,"
Gettum
said,
typing
again.
"I'll
play
along.
If
this
is
a
Grail
related
issue,
we
should
cross
reference
against
Grail
keywords.
I'll
add
a
proximity
parameter
and
remove
the
title
weighting.
That
will
limit
our
hits
only
to
those
instances
of
textual
keywords
that
occur
near
a
Grail
related
word."

"How
long
will
this
take?"
Sophie
asked.
"A
few
hundred
terabytes
with
multiple
cross
referencing
fields?"
Gettum's
eyes
glimmered
as
she
clicked
the
SEARCH
key.
"A
mere
fifteen
minutes."
Langdon
and
Sophie
said
nothing,
but
Gettum
sensed
this
sounded
like
an
eternity
to
them.
"Tea?"
Gettum
asked,
standing
and
walking
toward
the
pot
she
had
made
earlier.
"Leigh
always
loves
my
tea.

Opus
Dei
Centre

modest
brick
building

5
Orme
Court,
overlooking

North

Kensington
Gardens.
Silas
had
never
been
here,
but
he
felt
a
rising
sense
of
refuge
and
asylum
as
he
approached
the
building
on
foot.

Remy
