Collet
barely
looked
up
from
the
burning
embers.
"He's
on
the
phone."
"I'm
off
the
phone,"
Fache
snapped,
stalking
into
the
room.
"What
have
you
got?"
The
second
agent
said,
"Sir,
Central
just
heard
from
Andre
Vernet
at
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich.
He
wants
to
talk
to
you
privately.
He
is
changing
his
story."
"Oh?"
Fache
said.
Now
Collet
looked
up.
"Vernet
is
admitting
that
Langdon
and
Neveu
spent
time
inside
his
bank
tonight."
"We
figured
that
out,"
Fache
said.
"Why
did
Vernet
lie
about
it?"
"He
said
he'll
talk
only
to
you,
but
he's
agreed
to
cooperate
fully."
"In
exchange
for
what?"
"For
our
keeping
his
bank's
name
out
of
the
news
and
also
for
helping
him
recover
some
stolen
property.
It
sounds
like
Langdon
and
Neveu
stole
something
from
Sauniere's
account."
"What?"
Collet
blurted.
"How?"
Fache
never
flinched,
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
second
agent.
"What
did
they
steal?"
"Vernet
didn't
elaborate,
but
he
sounds
like
he's
willing
to
do
anything
to
get
it
back."
Collet
tried
to
imagine
how
this
could
happen.
Maybe
Langdon
and
Neveu
had
held
a
bank
employee
at
gunpoint?
Maybe
they
forced
Vernet
to
open
Sauniere's
account
and
facilitate
an
escape
in
the
armored
truck.
As
feasible
as
it
was,
Collet
was
having
trouble
believing
Sophie
Neveu
could
be
involved
in
anything
like
that.
From
the
kitchen,
another
agent
yelled
to
Fache.
"Captain?
I'm
going
through
Mr.
Teabing's
speed
dial
numbers,
and
I'm
on
the
phone
with
Le
Bourget
Airfield.
I've
got
some
bad
news."
Thirty
seconds
later,
Fache
was
packing
up
and
preparing
to
leave
Chateau
Villette.
He
had
just
learned
that
Teabing
kept
a
private
jet
nearby
at
Le
Bourget
Airfield
and
that
the
plane
had
taken
off
about
a
half
hour
ago.
The
Bourget
representative
on
the
phone
had
claimed
not
to
know
who
was
on
the
plane
or
where
it
was
headed.
The
takeoff
had
been
unscheduled,
and
no
flight
plan
had
been
logged.
Highly
illegal,
even
for
a
small
airfield.
Fache
was
certain
that
by
applying
the
right
pressure,
he
could
get
the
answers
he
was
looking
for.
"Lieutenant
Collet,"
Fache
barked,
heading
for
the
door.
"I
have
no
choice
but
to
leave
you
in
charge
of
the
PTS
investigation
here.
Try
to
do
something
right
for
a
change."
As
the
Hawker
leveled
off,
with
its
nose
aimed
for
England,
Langdon
carefully
lifted
the
rosewood
box
from
his
lap,
where
he
had
been
protecting
it
during
takeoff.
Now,
as
he
set
the
box
on
the
table,
he
could
sense
Sophie
and
Teabing
leaning
forward
with
anticipation.
Unlatching
the
lid
and
opening
the
box,
Langdon
turned
his
attention
not
to
the
lettered
dials
of
the
cryptex,
but
rather
to
the
tiny
hole
on
the
underside
of
the
box
lid.
Using
the
tip
of
a
pen,
he
carefully
removed
the
inlaid
Rose
on
top
and
revealed
the
text
beneath
it.
Sub
Rosa,
he
mused,
hoping
a
fresh
look
at
the
text
would
bring
clarity.
Focusing
all
his
energies,
Langdon
studied
the
strange
text.
t&amp;%&amp;V7C0dM&amp;
After
several
seconds,
he
began
to
feel
the
initial
frustration
resurfacing.
"Leigh,
I
just
can't
seem
to
place
it.
From
where
Sophie
was
seated
across
the
table,
she
could
not
yet
see
the
text,
but
Langdon's
inability
to
immediately
identify
the
language
surprised
her.
My
grandfather
spoke
a
language
so
obscure
that
even
a
symbologist
can't
identify
it?
She
quickly
realized
she
should
not
find
this
surprising.
This
would
not
be
the
first
secret
Jacques
Sauniere
had
kept
from
his
granddaughter.
Opposite
Sophie,
Leigh
Teabing
felt
ready
to
burst.
Eager
for
his
chance
to
see
the
text,
he
quivered
with
excitement,
leaning
in,
trying
to
see
around
Langdon,
who
was
still
hunched
over
the
box.
"I
don't
know,"
Langdon
whispered
intently.
"My
first
guess
is
a
Semitic,
but
now
I'm
not
so
sure.
Most
primary
Semitics
include
nekkudot.
This
has
none."
"Probably
ancient,"
Teabing
offered.
"Nekkudot?"
Sophie
inquired.
Teabing
never
took
his
eyes
from
the
box.
"Most
modern
Semitic
alphabets
have
no
vowels
and
use
nekkudot
tiny
dots
and
dashes
written
either
below
or
within
the
consonants
to
indicate
what
vowel
sound
accompanies
them.
Historically
speaking,
nekkudot
are
a
relatively
modern
addition
to
language."
Langdon
was
still
hovering
over
the
script.
"A
Sephardic
transliteration,
perhaps?"
Teabing
could
bear
it
no
longer.
"Perhaps
if
I
just"
Reaching
over,
he
edged
the
box
away
from
Langdon
and
pulled
it
toward
himself.
No
doubt
Langdon
had
a
solid
familiarity
with
the
standard
ancients
Greek,
Latin,
the
Romances
but
from
the
fleeting
glance
Teabing
had
of
this
language,
he
thought
it
looked
more
specialized,
possibly
a
Rashi
script
or
a
STA'M
with
crowns.
Taking
a
deep
breath,
Teabing
feasted
his
eyes
upon
the
engraving.
He
said
nothing
for
a
very
long
time.
With
each
passing
second,
Teabing
felt
his
confidence
deflating.
"I'm
astonished,"
he
said.
"This
language
looks
like
nothing
I've
ever
seen!"
Langdon
slumped.
"Might
I
see
it?"
Sophie
asked.
Teabing
pretended
not
to
hear
her.
"Robert,
you
said
earlier
that
you
thought
you'd
seen
something
like
this
before?"
Langdon
looked
vexed.
"I
thought
so.
I'm
not
sure.
The
script
looks
familiar
somehow."
"Leigh?"
Sophie
repeated,
clearly
not
appreciating
being
left
out
of
the
discussion.
"Might
I
have
a
look
at
the
box
my
grandfather
made?"
"Of
course,
dear,"
Teabing
said,
pushing
it
over
to
her.
He
hadn't
meant
to
sound
belittling,
and
yet
Sophie
Neveu
was
light
years
out
of
her
league.
If
a
British
Royal
Historian
and
a
Harvard
symbologist
could
not
even
identify
the
language
"Aah,"
Sophie
said,
seconds
after
examining
the
box.
"I
should
have
guessed."
Teabing
and
Langdon
turned
in
unison,
staring
at
her.
"Guessed
what?"
Teabing
demanded.
Sophie
shrugged.
"Guessed
that
this
would
be
the
language
my
grandfather
would
have
used."
"You're
saying
you
can
read
this
text?"
Teabing
exclaimed.
"Quite
easily,"
Sophie
chimed,
obviously
enjoying
herself
now.
"My
grandfather
taught
me
this
language
when
I
was
only
six
years
old.
I'm
fluent."
She
leaned
across
the
table
and
fixed
Teabing
with
