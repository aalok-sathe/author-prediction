on
the
floor.
I
wouldn't
have
given
it
a
second
thought
except
the
rungs
were
worn
and
muddy.
This
ladder
gets
regular
use.
The
height
of
the
hayloft
matched
the
ladder,
so
I
raised
it
and
climbed
up
to
have
a
look."
Collet's
eyes
climbed
the
ladder's
steep
incline
to
the
soaring
hayloft.
Someone
goes
up
there
regularly?
From
down
here,
the
loft
appeared
to
be
a
deserted
platform,
and
yet
admittedly
most
of
it
was
invisible
from
this
line
of
sight.
A
senior
PTS
agent
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
ladder,
looking
down.
"You'll
definitely
want
to
see
this,
Lieutenant,"
he
said,
waving
Collet
up
with
a
latex
gloved
hand.
Nodding
tiredly,
Collet
walked
over
to
the
base
of
the
old
ladder
and
grasped
the
bottom
rungs.
The
ladder
was
an
antique
tapered
design
and
narrowed
as
Collet
ascended.
As
he
neared
the
top,
Collet
almost
lost
his
footing
on
a
thin
rung.
The
barn
below
him
spun.
Alert
now,
he
moved
on,
finally
reaching
the
top.
The
agent
above
him
reached
out,
offering
his
wrist.
Collet
grabbed
it
and
made
the
awkward
transition
onto
the
platform.
"It's
over
there,"
the
PTS
agent
said,
pointing
deep
into
the
immaculately
clean
loft.
"Only
one
set
of
prints
up
here.
We'll
have
an
ID
shortly."
Collet
squinted
through
the
dim
light
toward
the
far
wall.
What
the
hell?
Nestled
against
the
far
wall
sat
an
elaborate
computer
workstation
two
tower
CPUs,
a
flat
screen
video
monitor
with
speakers,
an
array
of
hard
drives,
and
a
multichannel
audio
console
that
appeared
to
have
its
own
filtered
power
supply.
Why
in
the
world
would
anyone
work
all
the
way
up
here?
Collet
moved
toward
the
gear.
"Have
you
examined
the
system?"
"It's
a
listening
post."
Collet
spun.
"Surveillance?"
The
agent
nodded.
"Very
advanced
surveillance."
He
motioned
to
a
long
project
table
strewn
with
electronic
parts,
manuals,
tools,
wires,
soldering
irons,
and
other
electronic
components.
"Someone
clearly
knows
what
he's
doing.
A
lot
of
this
gear
is
as
sophisticated
as
our
own
equipment.
Miniature
microphones,
photoelectric
recharging
cells,
high
capacity
RAM
chips.
He's
even
got
some
of
those
new
nano
drives."
Collet
was
impressed.
"Here's
a
complete
system,"
the
agent
said,
handing
Collet
an
assembly
not
much
larger
than
a
pocket
calculator.
Dangling
off
the
contraption
was
a
foot
long
wire
with
a
stamp
sized
piece
of
wafer
thin
foil
stuck
on
the
end.
"The
base
is
a
high
capacity
hard
disk
audio
recording
system
with
rechargeable
battery.
That
strip
of
foil
at
the
end
of
the
wire
is
a
combination
microphone
and
photoelectric
recharging
cell."
Collet
knew
them
well.
These
foil
like,
photocell
microphones
had
been
an
enormous
breakthrough
a
few
years
back.
Now,
a
hard
disk
recorder
could
be
affixed
behind
a
lamp,
for
example,
with
its
foil
microphone
molded
into
the
contour
of
the
base
and
dyed
to
match.
As
long
as
the
microphone
was
positioned
such
that
it
received
a
few
hours
of
sunlight
per
day,
the
photo
cells
would
keep
recharging
the
system.
Bugs
like
this
one
could
listen
indefinitely.
"Reception
method?"
Collet
asked.
The
agent
signaled
to
an
insulated
wire
that
ran
out
of
the
back
of
the
computer,
up
the
wall,
through
a
hole
in
the
barn
roof.
"Simple
radio
wave.
Small
antenna
on
the
roof."
Collet
knew
these
recording
systems
were
generally
placed
in
offices,
were
voice
activated
to
save
hard
disk
space,
and
recorded
snippets
of
conversation
during
the
day,
transmitting
compressed
audio
files
at
night
to
avoid
detection.
After
transmitting,
the
hard
drive
erased
itself
and
prepared
to
do
it
all
over
again
the
next
day.
Collet's
gaze
moved
now
to
a
shelf
on
which
were
stacked
several
hundred
audio
cassettes,
all
labeled
with
dates
and
numbers.
Someone
has
been
very
busy.
He
turned
back
to
the
agent.
"Do
you
have
any
idea
what
target
is
being
bugged?"
"Well,
Lieutenant,"
the
agent
said,
walking
to
the
computer
and
launching
a
piece
of
software.
"It's
the
strangest
thing."
Langdon
felt
utterly
spent
as
he
and
Sophie
hurdled
a
turnstile
at
the
Temple
tube
station
and
dashed
deep
into
the
grimy
labyrinth
of
tunnels
and
platforms.
The
guilt
ripped
through
him.
involved
Leigh,
and
now
he's
in
enormous
danger.
Remy's
involvement
had
been
a
shock,
and
yet
it
made
sense.
Whoever
was
pursuing
the
Grail
had
recruited
someone
on
the
inside.
They
went
to
Teabing'sfor
the
same
reason
I
did.
Throughout
history,
those
who
held
knowledge
of
the
Grail
had
always
been
magnets
for
thieves
and
scholars
alike.
The
fact
that
Teabing
had
been
a
target
all
along
should
have
made
Langdon
feel
less
guilty
about
involving
him.
It
did
not.
We
need
to
find
Leigh
and
help
him.
Immediately.
Langdon
followed
Sophie
to
the
westbound
District
and
Circle
Line
platform,
where
she
hurried
to
a
pay
phone
to
call
the
police,
despite
Remy's
warning
to
the
contrary.
Langdon
sat
on
a
grungy
bench
nearby,
feeling
remorseful.
"The
best
way
to
help
Leigh,"
Sophie
reiterated
as
she
dialed,
"is
to
involve
the
London
authorities
immediately.
Trust
me."
Langdon
had
not
initially
agreed
with
this
idea,
but
as
they
had
hatched
their
plan,
Sophie's
logic
began
to
make
sense.
Teabing
was
safe
at
the
moment.
Even
if
Remy
and
the
others
knew
where
the
knight's
tomb
was
located,
they
still
might
need
Teabing's
help
deciphering
the
orb
reference.
What
worried
Langdon
was
what
would
happen
after
the
Grail
map
had
been
found.
Leigh
will
become
a
huge
liability.
If
Langdon
were
to
have
any
chance
of
helping
Leigh,
or
of
ever
seeing
the
keystone
again,
it
was
essential
that
he
find
the
tomb
first.
Unfortunately,
Remy
has
a
big
head
start.
Slowing
Remy
down
had
become
Sophie's
task.
Finding
the
right
tomb
had
become
Langdon's.
Sophie
would
make
Remy
and
Silas
fugitives
of
the
London
police,
forcing
them
into
hiding
or,
better
yet,
catching
them.
Langdon's
plan
was
less
certain
to
take
the
tube
to
nearby
King's
College,
which
was
renowned
for
its
electronic
theological
database.
