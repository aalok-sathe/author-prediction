Priory,"
Teabing
continued,
"was
given
a
sacred
charge
to
share
the
truth.
To
release
the
Sangreal
documents
when
the
End
of
Days
arrived.
For
centuries,
men
like
Da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
and
Newton
risked
everything
to
protect
the
documents
and
carry
out
that
charge.
And
now,
at
the
ultimate
moment
of
truth,
Jacques
Sauniere
changed
his
mind.
The
man
honored
with
the
greatest
responsibility
in
Christian
history
eschewed
his
duty.
He
decided
the
time
was
not

Teabing
turned
to
Sophie.
"He
failed
the

He
failed

that

eyes
boring
into
him
with
rage
and
realization.
"You
are
the
one
responsible
for
my
grandfather's
murder?"
Teabing
scoffed.
"Your
grandfather
and
his
senechaux
were
traitors
to
the
Grail."
Sophie
felt
a
fury
rising
from
deep
within.
He's
lying!
Teabing's
voice
was
relentless.
"Your
grandfather
sold
out
to
the
Church.
It
is
obvious
they
pressured
him
to
keep
the
truth
quiet."
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"The
Church
had
no
influence
on
my
grandfather!"
Teabing
laughed
coldly.
"My
dear,
the
Church
has
two
thousand
years
of
experience
pressuring
