'choice.'
Those
who
'chose'
the
original
history
of
Christ
were
the
world's
first
heretics.
"Fortunately
for
historians,"
Teabing
said,
"some
of
the
gospels
that
Constantine
attempted
to
eradicate
managed
to
survive.
The
Dead
Sea
Scrolls
were
found
in
the
1950s
hidden
in
a
cave
near
Qumran
in
the
Judean
desert.
And,
of
course,
the
Coptic
Scrolls
in
1945
at
Nag
Hammadi.
In
addition
to
telling
the
true
Grail
story,
these
documents
speak
of
Christ's
ministry
in
very
human
terms.
Of

the
Vatican,
in
keeping
with
their
tradition
of
misinformation,
tried
very
hard
to
suppress
the
release
of
these
scrolls.
And
why
wouldn't
they?
The
scrolls
highlight
glaring
historical
discrepancies
and
fabrications,
clearly
confirming
that
the
modern
Bible
was
compiled
and
edited
by
men
who
possessed
a
political
agenda
to
promote
the
divinity
of
the
man
Jesus
Christ
and
use
His
influence
to
solidify
their
own
power
base."
"And
yet,"
Langdon
countered,
"it's
important
to
remember
that
the
modern
Church's
desire
to
suppress
these
documents
comes
from
a
sincere
belief
in
their
established
view
of
Christ.
The
Vatican
is
made
up
of
deeply
pious
men
who
truly
believe
these
contrary
documents
could
only
be
false
testimony.
