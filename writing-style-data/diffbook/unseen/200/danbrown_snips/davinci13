Opera
House
and
crossed
Place
Vendome.
In
the
passenger
seat,
Robert
Langdon
felt
the
city
tear
past
him
as
he
tried
to
clear
his
thoughts.
His
quick
shower
and
shave
had
left
him
looking
reasonably
presentable
but
had
done
little
to
ease
his
anxiety.
The
frightening
image
of
the
curator's
body
remained
locked
in
his
mind.
Jacques
Sauniere
is
dead.
Langdon
could
not
help
but
feel
a
deep
sense
of
loss
at
the
curator's
death.
Despite
Sauniere's
reputation
for
being
reclusive,
his
recognition
for
dedication
to
the
arts
made
him
an
easy
man
to
revere.
His
books
on
the
secret
codes
hidden
in
the
paintings
of
Poussin
and
Teniers
were
some
of
Langdon's
favorite
classroom
texts.
Tonight's
meeting
had
been
one
Langdon
was
very
much
looking
forward
to,
and
he
was
disappointed
when
the
curator
had
not
shown.
Again
the
image
of
the
curator's
body
flashed
in
his
mind.
Jacques
Sauniere
did
that
to
himself?
Langdon
turned
and
looked
out
the
window,
forcing
the
picture
from
his
mind.
Outside,
the
city
was
just
now
winding
down
street
vendors
wheeling
carts
of
candied
amandes,
waiters
carrying
bags
of
garbage
to
the
curb,
a
pair
of
late
night
lovers
cuddling
to
stay
