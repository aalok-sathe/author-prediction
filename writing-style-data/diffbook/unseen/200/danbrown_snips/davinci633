on
numerous
occasions
with
the
new
pontiff,
who,
to
Aringarosa's
great
dismay,
had
turned
out
to
be
a
distressingly
fervent
voice
for
liberal
change
in
the
Church.
"I
want
to
assure
you,"
the
secretariat
added
quickly,
"that
His
Holiness
does
not
seek
to
change
anything
about
the
way
you
run
your
ministry.
should
hope
not!
"Then
why
am
I
here?"
The
enormous
man
sighed.
"Bishop,
I
am
not
sure
how
to
say
this
delicately,
so
I
will
state
it
directly.
Two
days
ago,
the
Secretariat
Council
voted
unanimously
to
revoke
the
Vatican's
sanction
of
Opus
Dei."
Aringarosa
was
certain
he
had
heard
incorrectly.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"Plainly
stated,
six
months
from
today,
Opus
Dei
will
no
longer
be
considered
a
prelature
of
the
Vatican.
You
will
be
a
church
unto
yourself.
The
Holy
See
will
be
disassociating
itself
from
you.
His
Holiness
agrees
and
we
are
already
drawing
up
the
legal
papers."
"But
that
is
impossible!"
"On
the
contrary,
it
is
quite
possible.
And
necessary.
His
Holiness
has
become
uneasy
with
your
aggressive
recruiting
policies
and
your
practices
of
corporal
mortification."
He
paused.
"Also
your
policies
regarding
women.
Quite
frankly,
Opus
Dei
has
become
a
liability
and
an
embarrassment."
