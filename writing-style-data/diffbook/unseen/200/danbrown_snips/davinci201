felt
heavy
and
dangerously
foreign.
Taking
the
stairs
two
at
a
time,
Langdon
wondered
if
Sophie
had
any
idea
how
valuable
a
painting
she
had
almost
ruined.
Her
choice
in
art
seemed
eerily
pertinent
to
tonight's
adventure.
The
Da
Vinci
she
had
grabbed,
much
like
the
Mona
Lisa,
was
notorious
among
art
historians
for
its
plethora
of
hidden
pagan
symbolism.
"You
chose
a
valuable
hostage,"
he
said
as
they
ran.
"Madonna
of
the
Rocks,
"
she
replied.
"But
I
didn't
choose
it,
my
grandfather
did.
He
left
me
a
little
something
behind
the
painting."
Langdon
shot
her
a
startled
look.
"What!?
But
how
did
you
know
which
painting?
Why
Madonna
of
the
Rocks?"
"So
dark
the
con
of
man."
She
flashed
a
triumphant
smile.
"I
missed
the
first
two
anagrams,
Robert.
I
wasn't
about
to
miss
the
third."
"They're
dead!"
Sister
Sandrine
stammered
into
the
telephone
in
her
Saint
Sulpice
residence.
She
was
leaving
a
message
on
an
answering
machine.
"Please
pick
up!
They're
all
dead!"
The
first
three
phone
numbers
on
the
list
had
produced
terrifying
results
a
hysterical
widow,
a
detective
working
late
at
a
murder
scene,
and
a
somber
priest
consoling
a
bereaved
family.
All
three
contacts
