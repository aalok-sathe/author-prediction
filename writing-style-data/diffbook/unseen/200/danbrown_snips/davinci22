He
advanced
with
unmistakable
authority
on
squat,
powerful
legs.
He
was
speaking
on
his
cell
phone
but
finished
the
call
as
he
arrived.
He
motioned
for
Langdon
to
enter.
"I
am
Bezu
Fache,"
he
announced
as
Langdon
pushed
through
the
revolving
door.
"Captain
of
the
Central
Directorate
Judicial
Police."
His
tone
was
fitting
a
guttural
rumble
like
a
gathering
storm.
Langdon
held
out
his
hand
to
shake.
"Robert
Langdon."
Fache's
enormous
palm
wrapped
around
Langdon's

crushing
force.
"I
saw
the

Langdon

with
his
wide
shoulders

and
his
chin
tucked
hard
into
his
chest.
His
dark
hair
was
slicked
back
with
oil,
accentuating
an
arrow
like
widow's
peak
that
divided
his
jutting
brow
and
preceded
him
like
the
prow
of
a
battleship.
As
he
advanced,
his
dark
eyes
seemed
to
scorch
the
earth
before
him,
radiating
a
fiery
clarity
that
forecast
his
reputation
for
unblinking
severity
in
all
matters.
Langdon
followed
the
captain
down
the
famous
marble
staircase
