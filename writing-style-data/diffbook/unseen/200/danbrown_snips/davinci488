city
did
not
appear
on
any
map
nor
in
any
other
documents,
and
yet
it
was
mentioned
repeatedly
in
the
Book
of
Jeremiah
the
king
of
Sheshach,
the
city
of
Sheshach,
the
people
of
Sheshach.
Finally,
a
scholar
applied
the
Atbash
Cipher
to
the
word,
and
his
results
were
mind
numbing.
The
cipher
revealed
that
Sheshach
was
in
fact
a
code
word
for
another
very
well
known
city.
The
decryption
process
was
simple.
Sheshach,
in
Hebrew,
was
spelled:
Sh
Sh
K.
Sh
Sh
K,
when
placed
in
the
substitution
matrix,
became
B
B
L.
B
B
L,
in
Hebrew,
spelled
Babel.
The
mysterious
city
of
Sheshach
was
revealed
as
the
city
of
Babel,
and
a
frenzy
of
biblical
examination
ensued.
Within
weeks,
several
more
Atbash
code
words
were
uncovered
in
the
Old
Testament,
unveiling
myriad
hidden
meanings
that
scholars
had
no
idea
were
there.
"We're
getting
close,"
Langdon
whispered,
unable
to
control
his
excitement.
"Inches,
Robert,"
Teabing
said.
He
glanced
over
at
Sophie
and
smiled.
"You
ready?"
She
nodded.
"Okay,
Baphomet
in
Hebrew
without
the
vowels
reads:
B
P
V
M
Th.
Now
we
simply
apply
your
Atbash
substitution
matrix
to
translate
the
letters
into
our
five
letter
password."
