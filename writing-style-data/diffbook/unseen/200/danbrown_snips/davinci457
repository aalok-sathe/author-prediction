the
armored
truck.
As
feasible
as
it
was,
Collet
was
having
trouble
believing
Sophie
Neveu
could
be
involved
in
anything
like
that.
From
the
kitchen,
another
agent
yelled
to
Fache.
"Captain?
I'm
going
through
Mr.
Teabing's
speed
dial
numbers,
and
I'm
on
the
phone
with
Le
Bourget
Airfield.
I've
got
some
bad
news."
Thirty
seconds
later,
Fache
was
packing
up
and
preparing
to
leave
Chateau
Villette.
He
had
just
learned
that
Teabing
kept
a
private
jet
nearby
at
Le
Bourget
Airfield
and
that
the
plane
had
taken
off
about
a
half

ago.
The
Bourget
representative
on
the
phone
had
claimed
not
to
know
who
was
on
the
plane
or
where
it
was
headed.
The
takeoff
had
been
unscheduled,
and
no
flight
plan
had
been
logged.
Highly
illegal,
even
for
a
small
airfield.
Fache
was
certain
that
by
applying
the
right
pressure,
he
could
get
the
answers
he
was
looking
for.
"Lieutenant
Collet,"
Fache
barked,
heading
for
the
door.
"I
have
no
choice
but
to
leave
you
in
charge
of
the
PTS
investigation
here.
Try
to
do
something
right
for
a
change."
As
the
Hawker
leveled
off,
with
its
nose
aimed
for
England,
Langdon
carefully
lifted
the
rosewood
box
from
