look
familiar."
Teabing
huffed.
"Perhaps
that
is
because
Mr.
Wren
comes
here
every
year!"
Or
perhaps,
Sophie
now
feared,
because
he
saw
Langdon
on
television
at
the
Vatican
last
year.
"I
have
never
met
Mr.
Wren,"
the
altar
boy
declared.
"You're
mistaken,"
Langdon
said
politely.
"I

you
and
I

"Tombs

"This

Teabing

"Only

This
was
believed
to

a
crypt
but
was
revealed
as
nothing
