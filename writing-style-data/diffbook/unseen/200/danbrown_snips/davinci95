Pushing
Sophie
from
his
mind,
Fache
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
miniature
knight
standing
on
Sauniere's
desk.
Then
he
turned
back
to
Collet.
"Do
you
have
him?"
Collet
gave
a
curt
nod
and
spun
the
laptop

Fache.

guided
him
through
a

series
of
dividers
displaying
Italian
drawings
and
hiding
the
rest
rooms

Finding
the
men's
room
door,
Langdon
entered
and
turned
