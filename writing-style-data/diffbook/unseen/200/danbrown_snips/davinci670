person
barely
visible
inside
the
screened
door.
"Grand
pere
?
"
she
called.
Her
grandfather
turned
and
waved,
motioning
for
her
to
wait
just
a
moment.
Then,
slowly,
he
said
some
final
words
to
the
person
inside
and
blew
a
kiss
toward
the
screened
door.
He
came
to
her
with
tearful
eyes.
"Why
are
you
crying,
Grand
pere?"
He
picked
her
up
and
held
her
close.
"Oh,
Sophie,
you
and
I
have
said
good
bye
to
a
lot
of
people
this

It's
hard."
Sophie
thought
of
the
accident,
of
saying
good
bye
to
her
mother
and
father,
her
grandmother
and
baby
brother.
"Were
you
saying
goodbye
to
another
person?"
"To
a
dear
friend
whom
I
love
very
much,"
he
replied,
his
voice
heavy
with
emotion.
"And
I
fear
I
will
not
see
her
again
for
a
very
long
time."
Standing
with
the
docent,
Langdon
had
been
scanning
the
chapel
walls
and
feeling
a
rising
wariness
that
a
dead
end
might
be
looming.
Sophie
had
wandered
off
to
look
at
the
code
and
left
Langdon
holding
the
rosewood
box,
which
contained
a
Grail
map
that
now
appeared
to
be
no
help
at
all.
Although
Sauniere's
poem
clearly
indicated
