to
life
timepieces,
water
pumps,
cryptexes,
and
even
a
fully
articulated
model
of
a
medieval
French
knight,
which
now
stood
proudly
on
the
desk
in
his
office.
Designed
by
Da
Vinci
in
1495
as
an
outgrowth
of
his
earliest
anatomy
and
kinesiology
studies,
the
internal
mechanism
of
the
robot
knight
possessed
accurate
joints
and
tendons,
and
was
designed
to
sit
up,
wave
its
arms,
and
move
its
head
via
a
flexible
neck
while
opening
and
closing
an
anatomically
correct
jaw.
This
armor
clad
knight,
Sophie
had
always
believed,
was
the
most
beautiful
object
her
grandfather
had
ever
built
that
was,
until
she
had
seen
the
cryptex
in
this
rosewood
box.
"He
made
me
one
of
these
when
I
was
little,"
Sophie
said.
"But
I've
never
seen
one
so
ornate
and
large."
Langdon's
eyes
had
never
left
the
box.
"I've
never
heard
of
a
cryptex."
Sophie
was
not
surprised.
Most
of
Leonardo's
unbuilt
inventions
had
never
been
studied
or
even
named.
The
term
cryptex
possibly
had
been
her
grandfather's
creation,
an
apt
title
for
this
device
that
used
the
science
of
cryptology
to
protect
information
written
on
the
contained
scroll
or
codex.
Da
Vinci
had
been
a
cryptology
pioneer,
Sophie
knew,
