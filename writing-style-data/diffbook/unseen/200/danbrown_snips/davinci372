"Surprise,
surprise.
Believe
me,
it's
no
mistake.
Leonardo
was
skilled
at
painting
the
difference
between
the
sexes."
Sophie
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
the
woman
beside
Christ.
The
Last
Supper
is
supposed
to
be
thirteen
men.
Who
is
this
woman?
Although
Sophie
had
seen
this
classic
image
many
times,
she
had
not
once
noticed
this
glaring
discrepancy.
"Everyone
misses
it,"
Teabing
said.
"Our
preconceived

our
mind

incongruity

the
photographs
in
art

taken

1954,
when
the
details
were
still
hidden
beneath
layers
of
grime
and
several
restorative
repaintings
done
by
clumsy
hands
in
the
eighteenth
century.
Now,
at
last,
the
fresco
has
been
cleaned
down
to
Da
Vinci's
original
layer
of
paint."
He
motioned
to
the
photograph.
"Etvoilaf"
Sophie
moved
closer
to
the
image.
The
woman
to
Jesus'
right
was
young
and
pious
looking,
with
a
demure
face,
beautiful
red
hair,
and
hands
folded
quietly.
This

the
woman
who
singlehandedly
could
crumble
