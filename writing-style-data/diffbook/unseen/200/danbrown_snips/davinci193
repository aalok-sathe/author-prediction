THOU

NO

Security
warden
Claude
Grouard
simmered
with
rage
as
he
stood
over
his
prostrate
captive
in
front
of
the
Mona
Lisa.
This
bastard
killed
Jacques
Sauniere!
Sauniere
had
been
like
a
well
loved
father
to
Grouard
and
his
security
team.
Grouard
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
pull
the
trigger

bullet
in
