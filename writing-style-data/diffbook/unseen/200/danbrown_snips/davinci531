another.
Can
you
imagine
the
four
chests
of
Sangreal
documents
sitting
right
here
with
Mary
Magdalene's
sarcophagus?
It
gives
me
gooseflesh."
Langdon
was
feeling
gooseflesh
too
as
they
stepped
into
the
circular
chamber.
His
eye
traced
the
curvature
of
the
chamber's
pale
stone
perimeter,
taking
in
the
carvings
of
gargoyles,
demons,
monsters,
and
pained
human
faces,
all
staring
inward.
Beneath
the
carvings,
a
single
stone
pew
curled
around
the
entire
circumference
of
the
room.
"Theater
in
the
round,"
Langdon
whispered.
Teabing
raised
a
crutch,
pointing
toward
the
far
left
of
the
room
and
then
to
the
far
right.
Langdon
had
already
seen
them.
Ten
stone
knights.
Five
on
the
left.
Five
on
the
right.
Lying
prone
on
the
floor,
the
carved,
life
sized
figures
rested
in
peaceful
poses.
The
knights
were
depicted
wearing
full
armor,
shields,
and
swords,
and
the
tombs
gave
Langdon
the
uneasy
sensation
that
someone
had
snuck
in
and
poured
plaster
over
the
knights
while
they
were
sleeping.
All
of
the
figures
were
deeply
weathered,
and
yet
each
was
clearly
unique
different
armory
pieces,
distinct
leg
and
arm
positions,
facial
features,
and
markings
on
their
shields.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
Langdon
felt
shaky
