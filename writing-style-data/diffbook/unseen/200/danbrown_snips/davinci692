He
broke
into
a
jog,
feeling
the
Rose
Line
beneath
his
feet,
guiding
him,
pulling
him
toward
his
destination.
As
he
entered
the
long
tunnel
of
Passage
Richelieu,
the
hairs
on
his
neck
began
to
bristle
with
anticipation.
He
knew
that
at
the
end
of
this
tunnel
stood
the
most
mysterious
of
Parisian
monuments
conceived
and
commissioned
in
the
1980s

to
the

The
Louvre

Gleaming
in
the
darkness.
He
admired
it
only
a
moment.
He
was
more
interested
in
what
lay
to
his
right.
Turning,
he
felt
his
feet
again
tracing
the
invisible
path
of
the
ancient
Rose
Line,
carrying
him
across
the
courtyard
to
the
Carrousel
du
Louvre
the
enormous
circle
of
grass
surrounded
by
a
perimeter
of
neatly
trimmed
hedges

site
of
Paris's
primeval
nature
worshipping
festivals
