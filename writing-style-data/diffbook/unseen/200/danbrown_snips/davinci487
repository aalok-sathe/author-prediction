is
normally

in

direction,
but
we
can
just
as
easily
use
Atbash
this
way.
Next,
all
we
have
to
do
is
create
our
substitution
scheme
by
rewriting
the
entire
alphabet
in
reverse
order
opposite
the
original
alphabet."
"There's
an
easier
way,"
Sophie
said,
taking
the
pen
from
Teabing.
"It
works
for
all
reflectional
substitution
ciphers,
including
the
Atbash.
A
little
trick
I
learned
at
the
Royal
Holloway."
Sophie
wrote
the
first
half
of
the
alphabet
from
left
to
right,
and
then,
beneath
it,
wrote
the
second
half,
right
to
left.
"Cryptanalysts
call
it
the
fold
over.
Half
as
complicated.
Twice
as
clean."

chuckled.
"Right

are.

Looking
at
Sophie's
substitution
matrix,
Langdon
felt
a
rising
thrill
that
he
imagined
must
have
rivaled
the
thrill
felt
by
early
scholars
when
they
first
used
the
Atbash
Cipher
to
decrypt
the
now
famous
Mystery
of
Sheshach.
For
years,
religious
scholars
had
been
baffled
by
biblical
references
to
a
city
called
Sheshach.
