the
entire
mass
of
the
edifice.
Across
a
staggeringly
expansive
plaza,
the
imposing
facade
of
the
Louvre
rose
like
a
citadel
against
the
Paris
sky.
Shaped
like
an
enormous
horseshoe,
the
Louvre
was
the
longest
building
in
Europe,
stretching
farther
than
three
Eiffel
Towers
laid
end
to
end.
Not
even
the
million
square
feet
of
open
plaza
between
the
museum
wings
could
challenge
the
majesty
of
the
facade's
breadth.
Langdon
had
once
walked
the
Louvre's
entire

an
astonishing
three

five
days
it
would
take
a
visitor
to
properly
appreciate
the
65,300
pieces
of
art
in
this
building,

full
sprint
through
the
museum
to
see
the
three
most
famous
objects:
the
Mona
Lisa,
Venus
de
Milo,
and
Winged
Victory.
Art
Buchwald
had
once
boasted
he'd
seen
all
three
masterpieces
in
five
minutes
and
fifty
six
seconds.
The
driver
pulled
out
a
handheld
walkie
talkie
and
spoke
in
rapid
fire
French.
"Monsieur
Langdon
est
arrive.
Deux
minutes.
An
indecipherable
confirmation
came
crackling
back.
The
agent
stowed
the
device,
turning
now
to
Langdon.
"You
will
meet
the
capitaine
at
the
main
entrance."
