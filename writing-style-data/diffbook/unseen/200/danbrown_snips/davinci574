the
name.
"The
British
Royal
Historian."
Gettum
brightened
now,
laughing.
"Heavens,
yes.
What
a
character.
Fanatical!
Every
time
he
comes
in,
it's
always
the
same
search
strings.
Grail.
Grail.
Grail.
I
swear
that
man
will
die
before
he
gives
up
on
that
quest."
She
winked.
"Time
and
money
afford
one
such
lovely
luxuries,
wouldn't
you
say?
A
regular
Don
Quixote,
that
one."
"Is
there
any
chance
you
can
help
us?"
Sophie
asked.
"It's
quite
important."
Gettum
glanced
around
the
deserted
library
and
then
winked
at

"Well,
I
can't
very
well
claim
I'm
too

now
can

As

as
you
sign
in,
I
can't
imagine
anyone
being
too

What
did
you
have
in
mind?"
"We're
trying
to
find
a
tomb
in
London."
Gettum
looked
dubious.
"We've
got
about
twenty
thousand
of
them.
Can
you
be
a
little
more
specific?"
"It's
the
tomb
of
a
knight.
We
don't
have
a
name."
"A
knight.
That
tightens
the
net
substantially.
Much
less
common."
"We
don't
have
much
information
about
the
knight
we're
looking
for,"
Sophie
said,
"but
this
is
what
we
know."
She
produced
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
she
had
written
only
the
first
two
lines
of
