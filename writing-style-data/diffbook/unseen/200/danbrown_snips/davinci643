he
would
not
hesitate
if
it
came
to
that.

given
her
every
opportunity
to
do
the
right
thing.
The
Grail
is
bigger
than
any
one
of
us.
At
that
moment,
Langdon
turned
from
the
window.
"The
tomb"
he
said
suddenly,
facing
them
with
a
faint
glimmer
of
hope
in
his
eyes.
"I
know
where
to
look
on
Newton's
tomb.
Yes,
I
think
I
can
find
the
password!"
Teabing's
heart
soared.
"Where,
Robert?
Tell

Sophie
sounded
horrified.
"Robert,

Then

take

Newton's

We'll
open
the
cryptex
together."
"I'm
not
going
anywhere,"
Sophie
declared,
her
eyes
narrowing
with
rage.
"That
cryptex
was
given
to
me
by
my
grandfather.
It
is
not
yours
to
open."
Langdon
wheeled,
looking
fearful.
"Sophie,
please!
You're
in
danger.
I'm
trying
to
help
you!"
"How?
By

the
secret
