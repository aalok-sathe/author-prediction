waned
with
the
passing
of
the
millennium.
Now
that
we've
passed
into
the
Age
of
Aquarius,
the
End
of
Days
has
arrived."
"Many
Grail
historians,"
Teabing
added,
"believe
that
"the
Priory
is
indeed
planning
to
release
this
truth,
this
point
in
history
would
be
a
symbolically
apt
time.
Most
Priory
academics,
myself
included,
anticipated
the
brotherhood's
release
would
coincide
precisely
with
the
millennium.
Obviously,
it
did
not.
Admittedly,
the
Roman
calendar
does
not
mesh
perfectly
with
astrological
markers,
so
there
is
some
gray
area
in
the
prediction.
Whether
the
Church
now
has
inside
information
that
an
exact
date
is
looming,
or
whether
they
are
just
getting
nervous
on
account
of
astrological
prophecy,
I
don't
know.
Anyway,
it's
immaterial.
Either
scenario
explains
how
the
Church
might
be
motivated
to
launch
a
preemptive
attack
against
the
Priory."
Teabing
frowned.
"And
believe
me,
if
the
Church
finds
the
Holy
Grail,
they
will
destroy
it.
The
documents
and
the
relics
of
the
blessed
Mary
Magdalene
as
well."
His
eyes
grew
heavy.
"Then,
my
dear,
with
the
Sangreal
documents
gone,
all
evidence
will
be
lost.
The
Church
will
have
won
their
age
old
war
to
rewrite
history.
The
past
will
be
erased
forever."
