Sophie."
"Now?"
"I
think
I
just
figured
something
out."
"What?"
"I'll
tell
you
in
a
minute.
I
need
your
phone."
Sophie
looked
wary.
"I

Fache
is
tracing,
but
keep
it
under
a

just
in

She
gave
him
her
phone.
"How
do
I
dial

okay."
The
line

"Jonas?"
"Robert?
You

me
up
and
you

for
it?"
"Jonas,

Langdon
said.
"I'll
