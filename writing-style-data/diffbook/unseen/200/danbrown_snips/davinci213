basement.
At
least
none
I've
ever
seen.
Turning
now
and
scanning
the
living
room,
Sophie's
eyes
fell
to
the
only
object
in
the
entire
house
that
seemed
out
of
place
her
grandfather's
favorite
antique,
a
sprawling
Aubusson
tapestry.
It
usually
hung
on
the
east
wall
beside
the
fireplace,
but
tonight
it
had
been
pulled
aside
on
its
brass
rod,
exposing
the
wall
behind
it.
Walking
toward
the
bare
wooden
wall,
Sophie
sensed
the
chanting
getting
louder.
Hesitant,
she
leaned
her
ear
against
the
wood.
The
voices
were
clearer
now.
People
were
definitely
chanting
intoning
words
Sophie
could
not
discern.
The
space
behind

discreetly
crafted.
A
sliding
door.
Heart
pounding,
she
placed
her
finger
in
the
slot
and
pulled
it.
With
noiseless
precision,
the
heavy
wall
slid
sideways.
From
out
of
the
darkness
beyond,
the
voices
echoed
up.
Sophie
slipped
through
the
door
and
found
herself
on
a
rough
hewn
stone
staircase
that
spiraled
downward.
She'd
been
coming
to
this
house
since
she
was
a
child
and
yet
had
no
idea
this
staircase
even
existed!
As
she
descended,
the
air
grew
cooler.
The
