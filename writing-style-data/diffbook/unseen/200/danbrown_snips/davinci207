they
requested,
when
he
delivered
the
work,
the
group
reacted
with
horror.
He
had
filled
the
painting
with
explosive
and
disturbing
details.
The
painting
showed
a
blue
robed
Virgin
Mary
sitting
with
her
arm
around
an
infant
child,
presumably
Baby
Jesus.
Opposite
Mary
sat
Uriel,
also
with
an
infant,
presumably
baby
John
the
Baptist.
Oddly,
though,
rather
than
the
usual
Jesus
blessing
John
scenario,
it
was
baby
John
who
was
blessing
Jesus
and
Jesus
was
submitting
to
his
authority!
More
troubling
still,
Mary
was
holding
one
hand
high
above
the
head
of
infant
John
and
making
a
decidedly
threatening
gesture
her
fingers
looking
like
eagle's
talons,
gripping
an
invisible
head.
Finally,
the
most
obvious
and
frightening
image:
Just
below
Mary's
curled
fingers,
Uriel
was
making
a
cutting
gesture
with
his
hand
as
if
slicing
the
neck
of
the
invisible
head
gripped
by
Mary's
claw
like
hand.
Langdon's
students
were
always
amused
to
learn
that
Da
Vinci
eventually
mollified
the
confraternity
by
painting
them
a
second,
"watered
down"
version
of
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
in
which
everyone
was
arranged
in
a
more
orthodox
manner.
The
second
version
now
hung
in
London's
National
Gallery
under
the
name
Virgin
of
the
Rocks,
