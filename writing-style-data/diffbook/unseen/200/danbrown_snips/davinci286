Sophie
said,
turning
to
Langdon.
"He
loved
anything
with
multiple
layers
of
meaning.
Codes

codes."
Langdon
was
already
moving
toward
the
electronic
podium
near
the
conveyor
belt.
Sophie
grabbed
the
computer
printout
and
followed.
The
podium
had
a
keypad
similar
to
that
of
a
bank
ATM
terminal.
The
screen
displayed
the
bank's
cruciform
logo.
Beside
the
keypad
was
a
triangular
hole.
Sophie
wasted
no
time
inserting
the
shaft
of
her
key
into
the
hole.
The
screen
refreshed
instantly.

Waiting.
Ten
digits.
Sophie
read
the
numbers
off
the
printout,
and
Langdon
typed
them
in.
ACCOUNT
NUMBER:
1332211185
When
he
had
typed
the
last
digit,
the
screen
refreshed
again.
A
message
in
several
languages
appeared.
English
was
on
top.
CAUTION:
Before
you
strike
the
enter

For

your

number,
this

will
automatically
shut
down.
"Fonction

"
Sophie
said,
frowning.
"Looks
like
we
only
get
one
try."
Standard
ATM
machines
allowed
users
three
attempts
to
type
a
PIN
before
confiscating
their
bank
card.
This
was
obviously
no
ordinary
cash
machine.
"The
