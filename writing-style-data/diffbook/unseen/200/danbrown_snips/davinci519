a
lot
of
time.
"Fache
will
not
give
up
easily,"
Sophie
said.
"He
has
too
much
riding
on
this
arrest
now."
Langdon
had
been
trying
not
to
think
about
Fache.
Sophie
had
promised
she
would
do
everything
in
her
power
to
exonerate
Langdon
once
this
was
over,
but
Langdon
was
starting
to
fear
it
might
not
matter.
Fache
could
easily
be
pan
of
this
plot.
Although
Langdon
could
not
imagine
the
Judicial
Police
tangled
up
in
the
Holy
Grail,
he
sensed
too
much
coincidence
tonight
to
disregard
Fache
as
a
possible
accomplice.
Fache
is

and
he
is
intent
on
pinning
these
murders
on

Then

Sophie
had
argued
that
Fache
might
simply
be
overzealous
to
make
the
arrest.
After
all,
the
evidence
against
Langdon
was
substantial.
In
addition
to
Langdon's
name
scrawled
on
the
Louvre
floor
and
in
Sauniere's
date
book,
Langdon
now
appeared
to
have
lied
about
his
manuscript
and
then
run
away.
At
Sophie
's
suggestion.
"Robert,
I'm
sorry
you're
so
deeply
involved,"
Sophie
said,
placing
her
hand
on
his
knee.
"But
I'm
very
glad
you're
here."
The
comment
sounded
more
pragmatic
than
romantic,
and
yet
Langdon
felt
an
unexpected
flicker
of
attraction
between
them.
He
