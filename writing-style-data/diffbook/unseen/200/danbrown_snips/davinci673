a
genius
with
his
hands.
He
made
all
kinds
of
things."
Langdon
glimpsed
an
unimaginable
web
of
connections
emerging.
"You
said
your
grandmother
raised
you.
Do
you
mind
my
asking
what
happened
to
your
parents?"
The
young
man
looked
surprised.
"They
died
when
I
was
young."
He
paused.
"The
same
day
as
my
grandfather."
Langdon's
heart
pounded.
"In
a
car
accident?"
The
docent
recoiled,
a
look
of
bewilderment
in
his
olive
green
eyes.
"Yes.
In
a
car
accident.
My
entire
family
died
that
day.
I
lost
my
grandfather,
my
parents,
and"
He
hesitated,
glancing
down
at
the
floor.
"And
your
sister,"
Langdon
said.
Out
on
the
bluff,
the
fieldstone
house
was
exactly
as
Sophie
remembered
it.
Night
was
falling
now,
and
the
house
exuded
a
warm
and
inviting
aura.
The
smell
of
bread
wafted
through
the
opened
screened
door,
and
a
golden
light
shone
in
the
windows.
As
Sophie
approached,
she
could
hear
the
quiet
sounds
of
sobbing
from
within.
Through
the
screened
door,
Sophie
saw
an
elderly
woman
in
the
hallway.
Her
back
was
to
the
door,
but
Sophie
could
see
she
was
crying.
The
woman
had
long,
luxuriant,
silver
hair
that
conjured
an
unexpected
wisp
of
memory.
