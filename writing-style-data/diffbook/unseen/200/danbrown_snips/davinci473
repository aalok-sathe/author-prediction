he
continued.
"It
means
sacred
marriage.
"The
ritual
I
saw
was
no
marriage."
"Marriage
as
in
union,
Sophie."
"You
mean
as
in
sex."
"No."
"No?"
she
said,
her
olive
eyes
testing
him.
Langdon
backpedaled.
"Well
yes,
in
a
manner
of
speaking,
but
not
as
we
understand
it
today."
He
explained
that
although
what
she
saw
probably
looked
like
a
sex
ritual,
Hieros
Gamos
had
nothing
to
do
with
eroticism.
It
was
a
spiritual
act.
Historically,
intercourse
was
the
act
through
which
male
and
female
experienced
God.
The
ancients
believed
that
the
male
was
spiritually
incomplete
until
he
had
carnal
knowledge
of
the
sacred
feminine.
Physical
union
with
the
female
remained
the
sole
means
through
which
man
could
become
spiritually
complete
and
ultimately
achieve
gnosis
knowledge
of
the
divine.
Since
the
days
of
Isis,
sex
rites
had
been
considered
man's
only
bridge
from
earth
to
heaven.
"By
communing
with
woman,"
Langdon
said,
"man
could
achieve
a
climactic
instant
when
his
mind
went
totally
blank
and
he
could
see
God.
Sophie
looked
skeptical.
"Orgasm
as
prayer?"
Langdon
gave
a
noncommittal
shrug,
although
Sophie
was
essentially
correct.
Physiologically
speaking,
the
male
climax
was
accompanied
by
a
split
second
entirely
devoid
of
thought.
