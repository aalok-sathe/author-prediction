up?"
one
of
the
inmates
asked.
Langdon
chuckled.
"No.
Da
Vinci
didn't
do
that
too
often.
Actually,
this
is
a
little
trick
Da
Vinci
played.
By
lowering
the
countryside
on
the
left,
Da
Vinci
made
Mona
Lisa
look
much
larger
from
the
left
side
than
from
the
right
side.
A
little
Da
Vinci
inside
joke.
Historically,
the
concepts
of
male
and
female
have
assigned
sides
left
is
female,
and
right
is
male.
Because
Da
Vinci
was
a
big
fan
of
feminine
principles,
he
made
Mona
Lisa
look
more
majestic
from
the
left
than
the
right."
"I
heard
he
was
a
fag,"
said
a
small
man
with
a
goatee.
Langdon
winced.
"Historians
don't
generally
put
it
quite
that
way,
but
yes,
Da
Vinci
was
a
homosexual."
"Is
that
why
he
was
into
that
whole
feminine
thing?"
"Actually,
Da
Vinci
was
in
tune
with
the
balance
between
male
and
female.
He
believed
that
a
human
soul
could
not
be
enlightened
unless
it
had
both
male
and
female
elements."
"You
mean
like
chicks
with
dicks?"
someone
called.
This
elicited
a
hearty
round
of
laughs.
Langdon
considered
offering
an
etymological
sidebar
about
the
word
hermaphrodite
and
its
ties
to
Hermes
and
Aphrodite,
but
