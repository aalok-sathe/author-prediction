Airport.
Lieutenant
Collet
helped
himself
to
a
Perrier
from
Teabing's
refrigerator
and
strode
back
out
through
the
drawing
room.
Rather
than
accompanying
Fache
to
London
where
the
action
was,
he
was
now
baby
sitting
the
PTS
team
that
had
spread
out
through
Chateau
Villette.
So
far,
the
evidence
they
had
uncovered
was
unhelpful:
a
single
bullet
buried
in
the
floor;
a
paper
with
several
symbols
scrawled
on
it
along
with
the
words
blade
and
chalice;
and
a
bloody
spiked
belt
that
PTS
had
told
Collet
was
associated
with
the

which
had
caused

Collet
sighed.
Good

Collet
entered
the
vast
ballroom
study,
where
the
chief
PTS
examiner
was
busy
dusting
for
fingerprints.
He
was
a
corpulent
man
in
suspenders.
"Anything?"
Collet
asked,
entering.
The
examiner
shook
his
head.
"Nothing
new.
Multiple
sets
matching
those
in
the
rest
of
the
house."
"How
about
the
prints
on
the
cilice
belt?"
"Interpol
is
still
working.
I
uploaded
everything
we
found."
Collet
motioned
