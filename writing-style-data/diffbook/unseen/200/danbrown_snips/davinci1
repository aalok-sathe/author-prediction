Robert
Langdon
awoke
slowly.
A
telephone
was
ringing
in
the
darkness
a
tinny,
unfamiliar
ring.
He
fumbled
for
the
bedside
lamp
and
turned
it
on.
Squinting
at
his
surroundings
he
saw
a
plush
Renaissance
bedroom
with
Louis
XVI
furniture,
hand
frescoed
walls,
and
a
colossal
mahogany
four
poster
bed.
Where
the
hell
am
I?
The
jacquard
bathrobe
hanging
on
his
bedpost
bore
the
monogram:
HOTEL
RITZ
PARIS.
Slowly,
the
fog
began
to
lift.
Langdon
picked
up
the
receiver.
"Hello?"
"Monsieur
Langdon?"
a
man's
voice
said.
"I
hope
I
have
not
awoken
you?"
Dazed,
Langdon
looked
at
the
bedside
clock.
It
was
12:32
A.M.
He
had
been
asleep
only
an
hour,
but
he
felt
like
the
dead.
"This
is
the
concierge,
monsieur.
I
apologize
for
this
intrusion,
but
you
have
a
visitor.
He
insists
it
is
urgent."
Langdon
still
felt
fuzzy.
A
visitor?
His
eyes
focused
now
on
a
crumpled
flyer
on
his
bedside
table.

Langdon
groaned.
Tonight's
lecture
a
slide
show
about
pagan
symbolism
hidden
in
the
stones
of
Chartres
Cathedral
had
probably
ruffled
some
conservative
feathers
in
the
audience.
Most
