The
sun's
rays
through
the
oculus,
the
graduated
shadows
on
the
gnomon,
this
is
what
makes
Saint
Sulpice
unique."
"Sister,
I
agree,
and
yet
I
would
consider
it
a
personal
favor
if
you
could
let
him
in
tonight.
He
can
be
there
at
say
one
o'clock?
That's
in
twenty
minutes."
Sister
Sandrine
frowned.
"Of
course.
It
would
be
my
pleasure."
The
abbe
thanked
her
and
hung
up.
Puzzled,
Sister
Sandrine
remained
a
moment
in
the
warmth
of
her
bed,
trying
to
shake
off
the
cobwebs
of
sleep.
Her

did
not

as

as
it
used
to,
although
tonight's
phone
call
had
certainly
roused
her
senses.
Opus

Beyond

the

corporal
mortification,
their
views
on
women
were
medieval
at
best.
She
had
been
shocked
to
learn
that
female
numeraries
were
forced
to
clean
the
men's
residence
halls
for
no
pay
while
the
men
were
at
mass;
women
slept
on
hardwood
floors,
while
the
men
had
straw
mats;
and
women
were
forced
to
endure
additional
requirements
of
corporal
mortification
all
as
added
penance
for
original
sin.
It

Eve's
