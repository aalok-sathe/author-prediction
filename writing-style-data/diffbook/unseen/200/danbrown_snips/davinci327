with
which
Fache
is
hunting
me."
"No,
I
meant
about
Vernet
trying
to
protect
his
bank."
Langdon
glanced
over.
"As
opposed
to?"
"Taking
the
keystone
for
himself."
Langdon
had
not
even
considered
it.
"How
would
he
even
know
what
this
box
contains?"
"His
bank
stored
it.
He
knew
my
grandfather.
Maybe
he
knew
things.
He
might
have
decided
he
wanted
the
Grail
for
himself."
Langdon
shook
his
head.
Vernet
hardly
seemed
the
type.
"In
my
experience,
there
are
only
two
reasons
people
seek
the
Grail.
Either
they
are
naive
and
believe
they
are
searching
for
the
long
lost
Cup
of
Christ"
"Or?"
"Or
they
know
the
truth
and
are
threatened
by
it.
Many
groups
throughout
history
have
sought
to
destroy
the
Grail."
The
silence
between
them
accentuated
the
sound
of
the
scraping
bumper.
They
had
driven
a
few
kilometers
now,
and
as
Langdon
watched
the
cascade
of
sparks
coming
off
the
front
of
the
truck,
he
wondered
if
it
was
dangerous.
Either
way,
if
they
passed
another
car,
it
would
certainly
draw
attention.
Langdon
made
up
his
mind.
"I'm
going
to
see
if
I
can
bend
this
bumper
back."
Pulling
onto
the
shoulder,
he
brought
the
truck
to
a
stop.
