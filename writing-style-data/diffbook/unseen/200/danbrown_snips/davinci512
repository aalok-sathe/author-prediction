the
French
police
cannot
be
trusted.
With
that,
Teabing's
manservant
opened
the
door
at
the
rear
of
the
stretch
limousine
and
helped
his
crippled
master
into
the
back
seat.
Then
the
servant
walked
the
length
of
the
car,
climbed
in
behind
the
wheel,
and
gunned
the
engine.
Policemen
scattered

"Well
played,
my
good

Teabing
chimed

With

in
fast,
Langdon
and
Sophie
dragged
the
monk
down
the
gangway
to
ground
level
and
out
of
sight
behind
the
limousine.
Then
the
jet
engines
had
roared
again,
rotating
the
plane
and
completing
its
turn
as
the
police
cars
came
skidding
into
the
hangar.
Now,
as
the
limousine
raced

Langdon
and
Sophie
clambered
