for
ten
minutes
now.
Newton's
tomb
consisted
of
a
massive
black
marble
sarcophagus
on
which
reclined
the
sculpted
form
of
Sir
Isaac
Newton,
wearing
classical
costume,
and
leaning
proudly
against
a
stack
of
his
own
books
Divinity,
Chronology,
Opticks,
and
Philosophiae
Naturalis
Principia
Mathematica.
At
Newton's
feet
stood
two
winged
boys
holding
a
scroll.
Behind
Newton's
recumbent
body
rose
an
austere
pyramid.
Although
the
pyramid
itself
seemed
an
oddity,
it
was
the
giant
shape
mounted
halfway
up
the
pyramid
that
most
intrigued
the
Teacher.
An
orb.
The
Teacher
pondered
Sauniere's
beguiling
riddle.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
The
massive
orb
protruding
from
the
face
of
the
pyramid
was
carved
in
basso
relievo
and
depicted
all
kinds
of
heavenly
bodies
constellations,
signs
of
the
zodiac,
comets,
stars,
and
planets.
Above
it,
the
image
of
the
Goddess
of
Astronomy
beneath
a
field
of
stars.
Countless
orbs.
The
Teacher
had
been
convinced
that
once
he
found
the
tomb,
discerning
the
missing
orb
would
be
easy.
Now
he
was
not
so
sure.
He
was
gazing
at
a
complicated
map
of
the
heavens.
Was
there
a
missing
planet?
Had
some
astronomical
orb
been
omitted
from
a
constellation?
He
had
no
