those
who
threaten
to
unveil
its
lies.
Since
the
days
of
Constantine,
the
Church
has
successfully
hidden
the
truth
about
Mary
Magdalene
and
Jesus.
We
should
not
be
surprised
that
now,
once
again,
they
have
found
a
way
to
keep
the
world
in
the
dark.
The
Church
may
no
longer
employ
crusaders
to
slaughter
non
believers,
but
their
influence
is
no
less
persuasive.
No
less
insidious."
He
paused,
as
if
to
punctuate
his
next
point.
"Miss
Neveu,
for
some
time
now
your
grandfather
has
wanted
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
family."
Sophie
was
stunned.
"How
could
you
know
that?"
"My
methods
are
immaterial.
The
important
thing
for
you
to
grasp
right
now
is
this."
He
took
a
deep
breath.
"The
deaths
of
your
mother,
father,
grandmother,
and
brother
were
not
accidental."
The
words
sent
Sophie's
emotions
reeling.
She
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
but
was
unable.
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"What
are
you
saying?"
"Robert,
it
explains
everything.
All
the
pieces
fit.
History
repeats
itself.
The
Church
has
a
precedent
of
murder
when
it
comes
to
silencing
the
Sangreal.
With
the
End
of
Days
imminent,
killing
the
Grand
Master's
loved
ones
sent
a
very
clear
message.
Be
quiet,
