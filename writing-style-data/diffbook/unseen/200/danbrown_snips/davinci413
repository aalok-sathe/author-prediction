pulled
the
cruciform
key
from
her
sweater
pocket
and
held
it
out
to
Teabing.
Teabing
took
the
key
and
studied
it.
"My
goodness.
The
Priory
seal.
Where
did
you
get
this?"
"My
grandfather
gave
it
to
me
tonight
before
he
died."
Teabing
ran
his
fingers
across
the
cruciform.
"A
key
to
a
church?"
She
drew
a
deep
breath.
"This
key
provides
access
to
the
keystone."
Teabing's
head
snapped
up,
his
face
wild
with
disbelief.
"Impossible!
What
church
did
I
miss?
I've
searched
every
church
in
France!"
"It's
not
in
a
church,"
Sophie
said.
"It's
in
a
Swiss
depository
bank."
Teabing's
look
of
excitement
waned.
"The
keystone
is
in
a
bank?"
"A
vault,"
Langdon
offered.
"A
bank
vault?"
Teabing
shook

head

"That's
impossible.
The
keystone
is
supposed
to
be
hidden
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose."
"It
is,"
Langdon
said.
"It
was
stored
in
a
rosewood
box
inlaid
with
a
five
petal
Rose."
Teabing
looked
thunderstruck.
"You've
seen
the
keystone?"
Sophie
nodded.
"We
visited
the
bank."
Teabing
came
over
to
them,
his
eyes
wild
with
fear.
"My
friends,
we
must
do
something.
The
keystone
is
in
danger!
We
have
a
duty
to
protect
it.
What
if
there
are
