belief,
should
we
do
that?
Should
we
wave
a
flag
and
tell
the
Buddhists
that
we
have
proof
the
Buddha
did
not
come
from
a
lotus
blossom?
Or
that
Jesus
was
not
born
of
a
literal
virgin
birth?
Those
who
truly
understand
their
faiths
understand
the
stories
are
metaphorical."
Sophie
looked
skeptical.
"My
friends
who
are
devout
Christians
definitely
believe
that
Christ
literally
walked
on
water,
literally
turned
water
into
wine,
and
was
born
of
a
literal
virgin
birth."
"My
point
exactly,"
Langdon
said.
"Religious
allegory
has
become
apart
of
the
fabric
of
reality.
And
living
in
that
reality
helps
millions
of
people
cope
and
be
better
people."
"But
it
appears
their
reality
is
false."
Langdon
chuckled.
"No
more
false
than
that
of
a
mathematical
cryptographer
who
believes
in
the
imaginary
number
'V
because
it
helps
her
break
codes."
Sophie
frowned.
"That's
not
fair."
A
moment
passed.
"What
was
your
question
again?"
Langdon
asked.
"I
can't
remember."
He
smiled.
"Works
every
time."
Langdon's
Mickey
Mouse
wristwatch
read
almost
seven
thirty
when
he
emerged
from
the
Jaguar
limousine
onto
Inner
Temple
Lane
with
Sophie
and
Teabing.
The
threesome
wound
through
a
maze
of
buildings
to
a
small
courtyard
outside
the
Temple
