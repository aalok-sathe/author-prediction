reek
of
rotting
cabbage,
the
stench
of
death,
human
urine
and
feces.
The
cries
of
hopelessness
against
the
howling
wind
of
the
Pyrenees
and
the
soft
sobs
of
forgotten
men.
Andorra,
he
thought,
feeling
his
muscles
tighten.
Incredibly,
it
was
in
that
barren
and
forsaken
suzerain
between
Spain
and
France,
shivering
in
his
stone
cell,
wanting
only
to
die,
that
Silas
had
been
saved.
He
had
not
realized
it
at
the
time.
The
light
came
long
after
the
thunder.
His
name
was
not
Silas
then,
although
he
didn't
recall
the
name
his
parents
had
given
him.
He
had
left
home
when
he
was
seven.
His
drunken
father,
a
burly
dockworker,
enraged
by
the
arrival
of
an
albino
son,
beat
his
mother
regularly,
blaming
her
for
the
boy's
embarrassing
condition.
When
the
boy
tried
to
defend
her,
he
too
was
badly
beaten.
One
night,
there
was
a
horrific
fight,
and
his
mother
never
got
up.
The
boy
stood
over
his
lifeless
mother
and
felt
an
unbearable
up
welling
of
guilt
for
permitting
it
to
happen.
This
is
my
fault!
As
if
some
kind
of
demon
were
controlling
his
body,
the
boy
walked
to
the
kitchen
and
grasped
a
butcher
knife.
Hypnotically,
