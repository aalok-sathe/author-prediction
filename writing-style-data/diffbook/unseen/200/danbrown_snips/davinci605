idea.
Even
so,
the
Teacher
could
not
help
but
suspect
that
the
solution
would
be
ingeniously
clean
and
simple
"a
knight
a
pope
interred."
What
orb
am
I
looking
for?
Certainly,
an
advanced
knowledge
of
astrophysics
was
not
a
prerequisite
for
finding
the
Holy
Grail,
was
it?
It

The
Teacher's
concentration
was
broken
by
several
approaching
tourists.
He
slipped
the
cryptex
back
in
his
pocket
and
watched
warily
as
the
visitors
went
to
a
nearby
table,
left

Tennyson,
and
Dickens
by
rubbing
furiously
on
their
graves.
Alone
again,
he
stepped
closer
to
the
tomb,
scanning
it
from
bottom
to
top.
He
began
with
the
clawed
feet
beneath
the
sarcophagus,
moved
upward
past
Newton,
past
his
books
on
science,
past
the
two
boys
with
their
mathematical
scroll,
up
the
face
of
the
pyramid
to
the
giant
orb
with
its
constellations,
and
