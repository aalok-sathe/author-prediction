her;
Grouard
had
heard
the
rumors
of
the
painful
falling
out
between
Sauniere
and
his
granddaughter.
"You
know
me,"
the
woman
called.
"And
Robert
Langdon
did
not
kill
my
grandfather.
Believe
me."
Warden
Grouard
was
not
about
to
take
that
on
faith.
need
backup!
Trying
his
walkie
talkie
again,
he
got
only
static.
The
entrance
was
still
a
good
twenty
yards
behind
him,
and
Grouard
began
backing
up
slowly,
choosing
to
leave
his
gun
trained
on
the
man
on
the
floor.
As
Grouard
inched
backward,
he
could
see
the
woman
across
the
room
raising
her
UV
light
and
scrutinizing
a
large
painting
that
hung
on
the
far
side
of
the
Salle
des
Etats,
directly
opposite
the
Mona
Lisa.
Grouard
gasped,
realizing
which
painting
it
was.
What
in
the
name
of
God
is
she
doing?
Across
the
room,
Sophie
Neveu
felt
a
cold
sweat
breaking
across
her
forehead.
Langdon
was
still
spread
eagle
on
the
floor.
Hold
on,
Robert.
Almost
there.
Knowing
the
guard
would
never
actually
shoot
either
of
them,
Sophie
now
turned
her
attention
back
to
the
matter
at
hand,
scanning
the
entire
area
around
one
masterpiece
in
particular
another
Da
Vinci.
But
the
UV
light
revealed
nothing
out
