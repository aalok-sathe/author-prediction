more
important,
they
are
known
as
the
guardians
of
an
ancient
secret.
One
that
made
them
immeasurably
powerful."
Despite
the
total
conviction
in
Langdon's
eyes,
Sophie's
gut
reaction
was
one
of
stark
disbelief.
A
secret
pagan
cult?
Once
headed
by
Leonardo
da
Vinci?
It
all
sounded
utterly
absurd.
And
yet,
even
as
she
dismissed
it,
she
felt
her
mind
reeling
back
ten
years
to
the
night
she
had
mistakenly
surprised
her
grandfather
and
witnessed
what
she
still
could
not
accept.
Could
that
explain
?
"The
identities
of
living
Priory
members
are
kept
extremely
secret,"
Langdon
said,
"but
the
P.S.
and
fleur
de
lis
that
you
saw
as
a
child
are
proof.
It
could
only
have
been
related
to
the
Priory."
Sophie
realized
now
that
Langdon
knew
far
more
about
her
grandfather
than
she
had
previously
imagined.
This
American
obviously
had
volumes
to
share
with
her,
but
this
was
not
the
place.
"I
can't
afford
to
let
them
catch
you,
Robert.
There's
a
lot
we
need
to
discuss.
You
need
to
go!"
Langdon
heard
only
the
faint
murmur
of
her
voice.
He
wasn't
going
anywhere.
He
was
lost
in
another
place
now.
A
place
where
ancient
secrets
rose
to
the
surface.
