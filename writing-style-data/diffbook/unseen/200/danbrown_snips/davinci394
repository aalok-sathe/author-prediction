Sangreal
documents
and
the
tomb
of
Mary
Magdalene?"
"Yes,
but
the
brotherhood
had
another,
more
important
duty
as
well
to
protect
the
bloodline
itself.
Christ's
lineage
was
in
perpetual
danger.
The
early
Church
feared
that
if
the
lineage
were
permitted
to
grow,
the
secret
of
Jesus
and
Magdalene
would
eventually
surface
and
challenge
the
fundamental
Catholic
doctrine
that
of
a
divine
Messiah
who
did
not
consort
with
women
or
engage
in
sexual
union."
He
paused.
"Nonetheless,
Christ's
line
grew
quietly
under
cover
in
France
until
making
a
bold
move
in
the
fifth
century,
when
it
intermarried
with
French
royal
blood
and
created
a
lineage
known
as
the
Merovingian
bloodline.
This
news
surprised
Sophie.
Merovingian
was
a
term
learned
by
every
student
in
France.
"The
Merovingians
founded
Paris."
"Yes.
That's
one
of
the
reasons
the
Grail
legend
is
so
rich
in
France.
Many
of
the
Vatican's
Grail
quests
here
were
in
fact
stealth
missions
to
erase
members
of
the
royal
bloodline.
Have
you
heard
of
King
Dagobert?"
Sophie
vaguely
recalled
the
name
from
a
grisly
tale
in
history
class.
"Dagobert
was
a
Merovingian
king,
wasn't
he?
Stabbed
in
the
eye
while
sleeping?"
"Exactly.
Assassinated
by
the
Vatican
in
collusion
with
Pepin
