of
his
own
volition.
Still,
it
had
been
almost
ten
minutes.
Too
long.
"Any
chance
Langdon
is
onto
us?"
Fache
asked.
Collet
shook
his
head.
"We're
still
seeing
small
movements
inside
the
men's
room,
so
the
GPS
dot
is
obviously
still
on
him.
Perhaps
he
feels
ill?
If
he
had
found
the
dot,
he
would
have
removed
it
and
tried
to
run.
Fache
checked
his
watch.
"Fine."
Still
Fache
seemed
preoccupied.
All
evening,
Collet
had
sensed
an
atypical
intensity
in
his
captain.
Usually
detached
and
cool
under
pressure,
Fache
tonight
seemed
emotionally
engaged,
as
if
this
were
somehow
a
personal
matter
for
him.
Not
surprising,
Collet
thought.
Fache
needs
this
arrest
desperately.
Recently
the
Board
of
Ministers
and
the
media
had
become
more
openly
critical
of
Fache's
aggressive
tactics,
his
clashes
with
powerful
foreign
embassies,
and
his
gross
overbudgeting
on
new
technologies.
Tonight,
a
high
tech,
high
profile
arrest
of
an
American
would
go
a
long
way
to
silence
Fache's
critics,
helping
him
secure
the
job
a
few
more
years
until
he
could
retire
with
the
lucrative
pension.
God
knows
he
needs
the
pension,
Collet
thought.
Fache's
zeal
for
technology
had
hurt
him
both
professionally
and
personally.
Fache
was
