doll,
his
black
cassock
flapping.
Lifting
a
weary
arm,
he
mopped
his
eyes
and
saw
the
man
holding
him
was
Silas.
The
great
albino
was
struggling
down
a
misty
sidewalk,
shouting
for
a
hospital,
his
voice
a
heartrending
wail
of
agony.
His
red
eyes
were
focused
dead
ahead,
tears
streaming
down
his
pale,
bloodspattered
face.
"My
son,"
Aringarosa
whispered,
"you're
hurt."
Silas
glanced
down,
his
visage
contorted
in
anguish.
"I
am
so
very
sorry,
Father."
He
seemed
almost
too
pained
to
speak.
"No,
Silas,"
Aringarosa
replied.
"It
is
I
who
am
sorry.
This
is
my
fault."
The
Teacher
promised
me
there
would
be
no
killing,
and
I
told
you
to
obey
him
fully.
"I
was
too
eager.
Too
fearful.
You
and
I
were
deceived."
The
Teacher
was
never
going
to
deliver
us
the
Holy
Grail.
Cradled
in
the
arms
of
the
man
he
had
taken
in
all
those
years
ago,
Bishop
Aringarosa
felt
himself
reel
back
in
time.
To
Spain.
To
his
modest
beginnings,
building
a
small
Catholic
church
in
Oviedo
with
Silas.
And
later,
to
New
York
City,
where
he
had
proclaimed
the
glory
of
God
with
the
towering
Opus
Dei
Center
on
Lexington
Avenue.
Five
months
ago,
Aringarosa
