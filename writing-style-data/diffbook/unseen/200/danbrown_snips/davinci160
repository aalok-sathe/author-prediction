been
on
the
defensive
for
too
long.
Tonight,
however,
the
rules
had
changed.
Only
five
months
ago,
Aringarosa
had
feared
for
the
future
of
the
Faith.
Now,
as
if
by
the
will
of
God,
the
solution
had
presented
itself.

The

had
reached
out
to
her
so
many
times
over
the
past
ten
years,
and
yet
Sophie
had
remained
immovable
leaving
his
letters
and
packages
unopened
in
a
bottom
drawer
and
denying
his
efforts
to
see
her.
He
lied
to
me!
Kept
appalling
secrets!
What
was
I
supposed
to
do
?
And
so
she
had
blocked
him

Completely.
Now
her
grandfather
was
dead,
and
he
was
talking
to
her
from
