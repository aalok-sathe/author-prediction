"
the
man
said.
"Good
evening.
Would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
follow
me,
s'il
vous
plait?"
Without
waiting
for
a
response,
he
spun
on
his
heel
and
strode
briskly
down
a
narrow
metal
corridor.
Langdon
walked
with
Sophie
down
a
series
of
corridors,
past
several
large
rooms
filled
with
blinking
mainframe
computers.
"Void,
"
their
host
said,
arriving
at
a
steel
door
and
opening
it
for
them.
"Here

are."
Langdon
and
Sophie
stepped

opened
bottle
of

its
bubbles
still
fizzing.
A
pewter
pot
of
coffee
steamed
beside
it.
Clockwork,
Langdon
thought.
Leave
it
to
the
Swiss.
The
man
gave
a
perceptive
smile.
"I
sense
this
is
your
first
visit
to
us?"
Sophie
hesitated
and
then
nodded.
"Understood.
Keys
are
often
passed
on
as
inheritance,
and
our
first
time
users
are
invariably
uncertain
of
the
protocol."
He
motioned
to
the
table
of
drinks.
"This
room
is
