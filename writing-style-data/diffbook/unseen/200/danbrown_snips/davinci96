toweled
off,
the
rest
room's
door
creaked
open
behind
him.
He
spun.
Sophie
Neveu
entered,
her
green
eyes
flashing
fear.
"Thank
God
you
came.
We
don't
have
much
time."
Langdon
stood
beside
the
sinks,
staring
in
bewilderment
at
DCPJ
cryptographer
Sophie
Neveu.
Only
minutes
ago,
Langdon
had
listened
to
her
phone
message,
thinking
the
newly
arrived
cryptographer
must
be

end
of
the
Grand
Gallery.
Sophie
stood
before
him
now,
still
catching
her
breath
after
doubling
back
to
the
rest
room.
In
the
fluorescent
lights,
Langdon
was
surprised
to
see
that
her
strong
air
actually
radiated
from
unexpectedly
soft
features.
Only
her
gaze
was
sharp,
and
the
juxtaposition
conjured
images
of
a
multilayered
Renoir
portrait
veiled
but
distinct,
with
a
boldness
that
somehow
retained
its
shroud
