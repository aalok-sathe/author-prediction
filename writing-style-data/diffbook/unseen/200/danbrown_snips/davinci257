in
hopes
of
unearthing
a
hidden
clue
as
to
the
Grail's
current
location.
Some
claimed
the
mountainous
backdrop
in
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
matched
the
topography
of
a
series
of
cave
ridden
hills
in
Scotland.
Others
insisted
that
the
suspicious
placement
of
disciples
in
The
Last
Supper
was
some
kind
of
code.
Still
others
claimed
that
X
rays
of
the
Mona
Lisa
revealed
she
originally
had
been
painted
wearing
a
lapis
lazuli
pendant
of
Isis
a
detail
Da
Vinci
purportedly
later
decided
to
paint
over.
Langdon
had
never
seen
any
evidence
of
the
pendant,
nor

it
could
possibly
reveal

still
discussed
it
ad

on
Internet
bulletin
boards
and
worldwideweb
chat
rooms.
Everyone
loves
a
conspiracy.
And
the
conspiracies
kept
coming.
Most
recently,
of
course,
had
been
the
earthshaking
discovery
that
Da
Vinci's
famed
Adoration
of
the
Magi
was
hiding
a
dark
secret
beneath
its
layers
of
paint.
Italian
art
diagnostician
Maurizio
Seracini
had
unveiled
the
unsettling
truth,
which
the
New
York
Times
Magazine
carried
prominently
in
a
story
titled
"The
Leonardo
Cover
Up."
Seracini
had
revealed
beyond
any
doubt
that
while
the
Adoration's
