could
have
visited
the
Mona
Lisa
before
he
died.
Sophie
gazed
back
up
the
emergency
stairwell
and
felt
torn.
She
knew
she
should
usher
Langdon
from
the
museum
immediately,
and
yet
instinct
urged
her
to
the
contrary.
As
Sophie
recalled
her
first
childhood
visit
to
the
Denon
Wing,
she
realized
that
if
her
grandfather
had
a
secret
to
tell
her,
few
places
on
earth
made
a
more
apt
rendezvous
than
Da
Vinci's
Mona
Lisa.
"She's
just
a
little
bit
farther,"
her
grandfather
had
whispered,
clutching
Sophie's
tiny
hand
as
he
led
her
through
the
deserted
museum
after
hours.
Sophie
was
six
years

She
felt
small
and
insignificant
as
she
gazed
up
at
the
enormous
ceilings
and

at
the
dizzying
floor.
The
empty
museum
frightened
her,
although
she
was
not
about
to
let
her
grandfather
know
that.
She
set
her
jaw
firmly
and
let
go
of
his
hand.
"Up
ahead
is
the
Salle
des
Etats,"
her
grandfather
said
as
they
approached
the
Louvre's
most
famous
room.
Despite
her
grandfather's
obvious
excitement,
Sophie
wanted
to
go
home.
She
had
seen
pictures
of
the
Mona
Lisa
in
books
and
didn't
like
it
at
all.
She
couldn't
understand
why
everyone
made
such
