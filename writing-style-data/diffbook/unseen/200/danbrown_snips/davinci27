sanctity
and
the
art
and
symbols
associated
with
it."
Fache
ran
a
meaty
hand
across
his
hair.
"And
Sauniere
was
knowledgeable
about
this?"
"Nobody
more
so."
"I
see."
Langdon
sensed
Fache
did
not
see
at
all.
Jacques
Sauniere
was
considered
the
premiere
goddess
iconographer
on
earth.
Not
only
did
Sauniere
have
a
personal
passion
for
relics
relating
to
fertility,
goddess
cults,
Wicca,
and
the
sacred
feminine,
but
during
his
twenty
year
tenure
as
curator,
Sauniere
had
helped
the
Louvre
amass
the
largest
collection
of
goddess
art
on
earth
labrys
axes
from
the
priestesses'
oldest
Greek
shrine
in
Delphi,
gold
caducei
wands,
hundreds
of
Tjet
ankhs
resembling
small
standing
angels,
sistrum
rattles
used
in
ancient
Egypt
to
dispel
evil
spirits,
and
an
astonishing
array
of
statues
depicting
Horus
being
nursed
by
the
goddess
Isis.
"Perhaps
Jacques
Sauniere
knew
of
your
manuscript?"
Fache
offered.
"And
he
called
the
meeting
to
offer
his
help
on
your
book."
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"Actually,
nobody
yet
knows
about
my
manuscript.
It's
still
in
draft
form,
and
I
haven't
shown
it
to
anyone
except
my
editor."
Fache
fell
silent.
Langdon
did
not
add
the
reason
he
hadn't
yet
shown
the
manuscript
to
anyone
else.
