Langdon
still
preferred
the
Louvre's
more
intriguing
original.
As
Sophie
gunned
the
car
up
Champs
Elysees,
Langdon
said,
"The
painting.
What
was
behind
it?"
Her
eyes
remained
on
the
road.
"I'll
show
you
once
we're
safely
inside
the
embassy."
"You'll
show
it
to
me?"
Langdon
was
surprised.
"He
left
you
a
physical
object?"
Sophie
gave
a
curt
nod.
"Embossed
with
a
fleur
de
lis
and
the
initials
P.S."
Langdon
couldn't
believe
his
ears.
We're
going
to
make
it,
Sophie
thought
as
she
swung
the
SmartCar's
wheel
to
the
right,
cutting
sharply
past
the
luxurious
Hotel
de
Crillon
into
Paris's
tree
lined
diplomatic
neighborhood.
The
embassy
was
less
than
a
mile
away
now.
She
was
finally
feeling
like
she
could
breathe
normally
again.
Even
as
she
drove,
Sophie's
mind
remained
locked
on
the
key
in
her
pocket,
her
memories
of
seeing
it
many
years
ago,
the
gold
head
shaped
as
an
equal
armed
cross,
the
triangular
shaft,
the
indentations,
the
embossed
flowery
seal,
and
the
letters
P.S.
Although
the
key
barely
had
entered
Sophie's
thoughts
through
the
years,
her
work
in
the
intelligence
community
had
taught
her
plenty
about
security,
and
now
the
key's
peculiar
tooling
no
longer
looked
so
mystifying.
