Bishop
Aringarosa
was
stupefied.
"An
embarrassment?"
"Certainly
you
cannot
be
surprised
it
has
come
to
this."
"Opus
Dei
is
the
only
Catholic
organization
whose
numbers
are
growing!
We
now
have
over
eleven
hundred
priests
!
"True.
A
troubling
issue
for
us
all."
Aringarosa
shot
to
his
feet.
"Ask
His
Holiness
if
Opus
Dei
was
an
embarrassment
in
1982
when
we
helped
the
Vatican
Bank!"
"The
Vatican
will
always
be
grateful
for
that,"
the
secretariat
said,
his
tone
appeasing,
"and
yet
there
are
those
who
still
believe
your
financial
munificence
in
1982
is
the
only
reason
you
were
granted
prelature
status
in
the
first
place."
"That
is
not
true!"
The
insinuation
offended
Aringarosa
deeply.
"Whatever
the
case,
we
plan
to
act
in
good
faith.
We
are
drawing
up
severance
terms
that
will
include
a
reimbursement
of
those
monies.
It
will
be
paid
in
five
installments."
"You
are
buying
me
off?"
Aringarosa
demanded.
"Paying
me
to
go
quietly?
When
Opus
Dei
is
the
only
remaining
voice
of
reason!"
One
of
the
cardinals
glanced
up.
"I'm
sorry,
did
you
say
reason?"
Aringarosa
leaned
across
the
table,
sharpening
his
tone
to
a
point.
"Do
you
really
wonder
why
Catholics
are
leaving
the
Church?
