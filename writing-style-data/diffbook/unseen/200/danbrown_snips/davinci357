this
day,
most
churchgoers
attend
services
on
Sunday
morning
with
no
idea
that
they
are
there
on
account
of
the
pagan
sun
god's
weekly
tribute
Sunday."
Sophie's
head
was
spinning.
"And
all
of
this
relates
to
the
Grail?"
"Indeed,"
Teabing
said.
"Stay
with
me.
During
this
fusion
of
religions,
Constantine
needed
to
strengthen
the
new
Christian
tradition,
and
held
a
famous
ecumenical
gathering
known
as
the
Council
of
Nicaea."
Sophie
had
heard
of
it
only
insofar
as
its
being
the
birthplace
of
the
Nicene
Creed.
"At
this
gathering,"
Teabing
said,
"many
aspects
of
Christianity
were
debated
and
voted
upon
the
date
of
Easter,
the
role
of
the
bishops,
the
administration
of
sacraments,
and,
of
course,
the
divinity
of
Jesus."
"I
don't
follow.
His
divinity?"
"My
dear,"
Teabing
declared,
"until
that
moment
in
history,
Jesus
was
viewed
by
His
followers
as
a
mortal
prophet
a
great
and
powerful
man,
but
a
man
nonetheless.
A
mortal."
"Not
the
Son
of
God?"
"Right,"
Teabing
said.
"Jesus'
establishment
as
'the
Son
of
God'
was
officially
proposed
and
voted
on
by
the
Council
of
Nicaea.
"Hold
on.
You're
saying
Jesus'
divinity
was
the
result
of
a
vote?"
"A
relatively
close
vote
at
that,"
Teabing
added.
