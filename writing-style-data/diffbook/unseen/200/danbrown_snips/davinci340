full
minute
passed.
Finally,
someone
spoke.
"My
good
man,
I
daresay
you
are
still
on
Harvard
Standard
Time."
The
voice
was
crisp
and
light.
Langdon
grinned,
recognizing
the
thick
British
accent.
"Leigh,
my
apologies
for
waking
you
at
this
obscene
hour."
"My
manservant
tells
me
that
not
only
are
you
in
Paris,

that
might

Sophie.
"Bear
with
me
here.
As
I
mentioned,
he's
something
of
a
character."
"Your
first
question,"
Teabing
declared,
his
tone
Herculean.
"Shall
I
serve
you
coffee,
or
tea?"
Langdon
knew
Teabing's
feelings
about
the
American
phenomenon
of
coffee.
"Tea,"
he
replied.
"Earl
Grey."
"Excellent.
Your
second
question.
Milk
or

Langdon
hesitated.
"Milk,
"
Sophie
whispered
in
his
ear.
"I
