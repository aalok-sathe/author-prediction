Christian
cross
but
rather
was
a
square
cross
with
four
arms
of
equal
length
which
predated
Christianity
by
fifteen
hundred
years.
This
kind
of
cross
carried
none
of
the
Christian
connotations
of
crucifixion
associated
with
the
longerstemmed
Latin
Cross,
originated
by
Romans
as
a
torture
device.
Langdon
was
always
surprised
how
few
Christians
who
gazed
upon
"the
crucifix"
realized

symbol's
violent
history
was
reflected
in
its
very
name:
"cross"
and
"crucifix"
came
from
the
Latin
verb
cruciare
to
torture.
"Sophie,"
he
said,
"all
I
can
tell
you
is
that
equal

impractical
for
use
in
crucifixion,
and
their
balanced
vertical
and
horizontal
elements
convey
a
natural
union
of
male
and
female,
making
them
symbolically
consistent
with
Priory
philosophy.
She
gave
him
a

look.
"You
have
no
idea,
do
you?"
Langdon
frowned.
"Not
a
clue."
"Okay,
we
have
to
get
off
the
road."
Sophie
checked
her
rearview
mirror.
"We
need
a
safe
place
to
figure
out
what
that
key
opens."
Langdon
thought
longingly
of
his
comfortable
room
at
the
Ritz.
Obviously,
that
was
not
an
option.
