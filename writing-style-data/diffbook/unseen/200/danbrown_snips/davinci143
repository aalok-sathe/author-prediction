Divine
Proportion.
For
this
reason,
the
five
pointed
star
has
always
been
the
symbol
for
beauty
and
perfection
associated
with
the
goddess
and
the
sacred
feminine."
The
girls
in
class
beamed.
"One
note,
folks.
We've
only
touched
on
Da
Vinci
today,
but
we'll
be
seeing
a
lot
more
of
him
this
semester.
Leonardo
was
a

the
ancient
ways

Tomorrow,
I'll

"You're

faraway
thoughts.
He
realized
he
was
standing
at
a
dead
stop
on
the
stairs,
paralyzed
by
sudden
revelation.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Oh,
lame
saint!
Sophie
was
looking
back
at
him.
It
can
't
be
that
simple,
Langdon
thought.
But
he
knew
of
course
that
it
was.

and

Langdon
