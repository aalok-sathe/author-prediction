declared,
her
voice
hollow
in
the
stairwell.
"To
the
Mona
Lisa?"
Langdon
recoiled.
"Now?"
Sophie
considered
the
risk.
"I'm
not
a
murder
suspect.
I'll
take
my
chances.
I
need
to
understand
what
my
grandfather
was
trying
to
tell
me."
"What
about
the
embassy?"
Sophie
felt
guilty
turning
Langdon
into
a
fugitive
only
to
abandon
him,
but
she
saw
no
other
option.
She
pointed
down
the
stairs
to
a
metal
door.
"Go
through
that
door,
and
follow
the
illuminated
exit
signs.
My
grandfather
used
to
bring
me

The
signs

She

"Mine

the
red
SmartCar
in
the
employee

the
embassy?"
Langdon
nodded,
eyeing
the
keys
in
his
hand.
"Listen,"
Sophie
said,
her
voice
softening.
"I
think
my
grandfather
may
have
left
me
a
message
at
the
Mona
Lisa
some
kind
of
clue
as
to
who
killed
him.
Or
why
I'm
in
danger."
Or
what
happened
to
my
family.
"I
have
to
go
see."
"But
if
he
wanted
to
tell
you
why
you
were
in
danger,
why
wouldn't
he
simply
write
