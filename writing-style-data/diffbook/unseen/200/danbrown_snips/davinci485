a
common
symbol
of
procreation
and
fecundity.
The
Templars
honored
Baphomet
by
encircling
a
stone
replica
of
his
head
and
chanting
prayers.
"Baphomet,"
Teabing
tittered.
"The
ceremony
honored
the
creative
magic
of
sexual
union,
but
Pope
Clement
convinced
everyone
that
Baphomet's
head
was
in
fact
that
of
the
devil.
The
Pope
used
the
head
of
Baphomet
as
the
linchpin
in
his
case
against
the
Templars."
Langdon
concurred.
The
modern
belief
in
a
homed
devil
known
as
Satan
could
be
traced
back
to
Baphomet
and
the
Church's
attempts
to
recast
the
horned
fertility
god
as
a
symbol
of
evil.
The
Church
had
obviously
succeeded,
although
not
entirely.
Traditional
American
Thanksgiving
tables
still
bore
pagan,
horned
fertility
symbols.
The
cornucopia
or
"horn
of
plenty"
was
a
tribute
to
Baphomet's
fertility
and
dated
back
to
Zeus
being
suckled
by
a
goat
whose
horn
broke
off
and
magically
filled
with
fruit.
Baphomet
also
appeared
in
group
photographs
when
some
joker
raised
two
fingers
behind
a
friend's
head
in
the
V
symbol
of
horns;
certainly
few
of
the
pranksters
realized
their
mocking
gesture
was
in
fact
advertising
their
victim's
robust
sperm
count.
"Yes,
yes,"
Teabing
was
saying
excitedly.
"Baphomet
must
be
