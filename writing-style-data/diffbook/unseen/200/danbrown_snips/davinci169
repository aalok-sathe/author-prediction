this
key,
Sophie.
To
me
or
to
anyone.
She
knew
she
had
failed
him
in
forgiveness,
and
she
wondered
if
she
could
break
his
trust
again.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Her
grandfather
wanted
Langdon
to
help.
Sophie
nodded.
"Yes,
I
saw
the
initials
P.S.
once.

the

that
had
confirmed

Langdon
said,
"combined

Their
logo."
"How
