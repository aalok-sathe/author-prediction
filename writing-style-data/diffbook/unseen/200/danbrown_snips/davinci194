walking
briskly
toward
the
far
left
wall.
In
front
of
her,
a
purplish
beam
of
light
swung
back
and
forth
across
the
floor,
as
if
she
were
searching
for
something
with
a
colored
flashlight.
"Qui
est
la
?
"
Grouard
demanded,
feeling
his
adrenaline
spike
for
a
second
time
in
the
last
thirty
seconds.
He
suddenly
didn't
know
where
to
aim
his
gun
or
what
direction
to
move.
"PTS,"
the
woman
replied
calmly,
still
scanning
the
floor
with
her

as

understand

DCPJ
would
be
looking
for

nom!"

yelled,

telling
him
something

amiss.
"Repondez!"
"C'est

the
voice
responded
in
calm
French.
"Sophie
Neveu.
Somewhere
in
the
distant
recesses
of
Grouard's
mind,
the
name
registered.
Sophie
Neveu?
That
was
the
name
of
Sauniere's
granddaughter,
wasn't
it?
She
used
to
come
in
here
as
a
little
kid,
but
that
was
years
ago.
This
couldn't
possibly
be
her!
And
even
if
it
were
Sophie
Neveu,
that
was
hardly
a
reason
to
trust
