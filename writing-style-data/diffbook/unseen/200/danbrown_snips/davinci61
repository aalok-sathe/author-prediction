bizarre
was
the
series
of
numbers.
"Part
of
it
looks
like
a
numeric
cipher.
"Yes,"
Fache
said.
"Our
cryptographers
are
already
working
on
it.
We
believe
these
numbers
may
be
the
key
to
who
killed
him.
Maybe
a
telephone
exchange
or
some
kind
of
social
identification.
Do
the
numbers
have
any
symbolic
meaning
to
you?"
Langdon
looked
again
at
the
digits,
sensing
it
would
take
him
hours
to
extract
any
symbolic
meaning.
If
Sauniere
had
even
intended
any.
To
Langdon,
the
numbers
looked
totally
random.
He
was
accustomed
to
symbolic
progressions
that
made
some
semblance
of
sense,
but
everything
here
the
pentacle,
the
text,
the
numbers
seemed
disparate
at
the
most
fundamental
level.
"You
alleged
earlier,"
Fache
said,
"that
Sauniere's
actions
here
were
all
in
an
effort
to
send
some
sort
of
message
goddess
worship
or
something
in
that
vein?
How
does
this
message
fit
in?"
Langdon
knew
the
question
was
rhetorical.
This
bizarre
communique
obviously
did
not
fit
Langdon's
scenario
of
goddess
worship
at
all.
O,
Draconian
devil?
Oh,
lame
saint?
Fache
said,
"This
text
appears
to
be
an
accusation
of
some
sort.
Wouldn't
you
agree?"
Langdon
tried
to
imagine
the
curator's
final
minutes
trapped
alone
in
the
Grand
