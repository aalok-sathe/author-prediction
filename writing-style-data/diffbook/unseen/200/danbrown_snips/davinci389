by
the
Church,
Mary
Magdalene
became
secretly
known
by
many
pseudonyms
the
Chalice,
the
Holy
Grail,
and
the
Rose."
He
paused.
"The
Rose
has
ties
to
the
five
pointed
pentacle
of
Venus
and
the
guiding
Compass
Rose.
By
the
way,
the
word
rose
is
identical
in
English,
French,
German,
and
many
other
languages."
"Rose,"
Langdon
added,
"is
also
an
anagram
of
Eros,
the
Greek
god
of
sexual
love."
Sophie
gave
him
a
surprised
look
as
Teabing
plowed
on.
"The
Rose
has

flowering
rose's
ties
to

at
Robert.

the

could
explain?"
Robert
hesitated.
A
moment
too
long.
"Oh,
heavens!"
Teabing
huffed.
"You
Americans
are
such
prudes."
He
looked
back
at
Sophie.
"What
Robert
is
fumbling
with
is
the
fact
that
the
blossoming
flower
resembles
the
female
genitalia,
the
sublime
blossom
from
which
all
mankind
enters
the
world.
And
if
you've
ever
seen
any

Georgia
O'Keeffe,
you'll

exactly

"The

Langdon
said,
