Thirty
yards
ahead
loomed
the
gateway
to
the
Louvre's
most
popular
section
la
Grande
Galerie
a
seemingly
endless
corridor
that
housed
the
Louvre's
most
valuable
Italian
masterpieces.
Langdon
had
already
discerned
that
this
was
where
Sauniere's
body
lay;
the
Grand
Gallery's
famous
parquet
floor
had
been
unmistakable
in
the
Polaroid.
As
they
approached,
Langdon
saw
the
entrance
was
blocked
by
an
enormous
steel
grate
that
looked
like
something
used
by
medieval
castles
to
keep
out
marauding
armies.
"Containment
security,
"
Fache
said,
as
they
neared
the
grate.
Even
in
the
darkness,
the
barricade
looked
like
it
could
have
restrained
a
tank.
Arriving
outside,
Langdon
peered
through
the
bars
into
the
dimly
lit
caverns
of
the
Grand
Gallery.
"After
you,
Mr.
Langdon,"
Fache
said.
Langdon
turned.
After
me,
where
?
Fache
motioned
toward
the
floor
at
the
base
of
the
grate.
Langdon
looked
down.
In
the
darkness,
he
hadn't
noticed.
The
barricade
was
raised
about
two
feet,
providing
an
awkward
clearance
underneath.
"This
area
is
still
off
limits
to
Louvre
security,"
Fache
said.
"My
team
from
Police
Technique
et
Scientifique
has
just
finished
their
investigation."
He
motioned
to
the
opening.
"Please
slide
under."
Langdon
stared
at
the
narrow
crawl
space
at
