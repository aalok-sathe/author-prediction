but
the
Knights
had
finally
found
what
they
had
been
searching
for.
They
took
the
treasure
from
the
temple
and
traveled
to
Europe,
where
their
influence
seemed
to
solidify
overnight.
Nobody
was
certain
whether
the
Knights
had
blackmailed
the
Vatican
or
whether
the
Church
simply
tried
to
buy
the
Knights'
silence,
but
Pope
Innocent
II
immediately
issued
an
unprecedented
papal
bull
that
afforded
the
Knights
Templar
limitless
power
and
declared
them
"a
law
unto
themselves"
an
autonomous
army
independent
of
all
interference
from
kings
and
prelates,
both
religious
and
political.
With
their
new
carte
blanche
from
the
Vatican,
the
Knights
Templar
expanded
at
a
staggering
rate,
both
in
numbers
and
political
force,
amassing
vast
estates
in
over
a
dozen
countries.
They
began
extending
credit
to
bankrupt
royals
and
charging
interest
in
return,
thereby
establishing
modern
banking
and
broadening
their
wealth
and
influence
still
further.
By
the
1300s,
the
Vatican
sanction
had
helped
the
Knights
amass
so
much
power
that
Pope
Clement
V
decided
that
something
had
to
be
done.
Working
in
concert
with
France's
King
Philippe
IV,
the
Pope
devised
an
ingeniously
planned
sting
operation
to
quash
the
Templars
and
seize
their
treasure,
thus
taking
control
of
the
secrets
held
