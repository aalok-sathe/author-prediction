impression
Magdalene
was
poor."
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"Magdalene
was
recast
as
a
whore
in
order
to
erase
evidence
of
her
powerful
family
ties."
Sophie
found
herself
again
glancing
at
Langdon,
who
again
nodded.
She
turned
back
to
Teabing.
"But
why
would
the
early
Church
care
if
Magdalene
had
royal
blood?"
The
Briton
smiled.
"My
dear
child,
it
was
not
Mary
Magdalene's
royal
blood
that
concerned
the
Church
so
much
as
it
was
her
consorting
with
Christ,
who
also
had
royal
blood.
As
you
know,
the
Book
of
Matthew
tells
us
that
Jesus
was
of
the
House
of
David.
A
descendant
of
King
Solomon
King
of
the
Jews.
By
marrying
into
the
powerful
House
of
Benjamin,
Jesus
fused
two
royal
bloodlines,
creating
a
potent
political
union
with
the
potential
of
making
a
legitimate
claim
to
the
throne
and
restoring
the
line
of
kings
as
it
was
under
Solomon."
Sophie
sensed
he
was
at
last
coming
to
his
point.
Teabing
looked
excited
now.
"The
legend
of
the
Holy
Grail
is
a
legend
about
royal
blood.
When
Grail
legend
speaks
of
'the
chalice
that
held
the
blood
of
Christ'
it
speaks,
in
fact,
of
Mary
Magdalene
the
female
womb
that
carried
Jesus'
