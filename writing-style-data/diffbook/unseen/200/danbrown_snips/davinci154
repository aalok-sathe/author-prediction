commanding
Sophie
to
find
him.
But
why?
Merely
so
Langdon
could
help
her
break
an
anagram?
It
seemed
quite
unlikely.
After
all,
Sauniere
had
no
reason
to
think
Langdon
was
especially
skilled
at
anagrams.
We've
never
even
met.
More
important,
Sophie
had
stated
flat
out
that
she
should
have
broken
the
anagram
on
her
own.
It
had
been
Sophie
who
spotted
the
Fibonacci
sequence,
and,
no
doubt,
Sophie
who,
if
given
a
little
more
time,
would
have
deciphered
the
message
with
no
help
from
Langdon.
Sophie
was

Sauniere's
actions.
Why
me?
Langdon
wondered,
heading
down
the
hall.
Why
was
Sauniere's
dying
wish
that
his
estranged
granddaughter
find
me?
What
is
it
that
Sauniere
thinks
I
know?
With
an
unexpected
jolt,
Langdon
stopped
short.
Eyes
wide,
he
dug
in
his
pocket
and
yanked
out
the
computer
printout.
He
stared
at
the
last
line
of
Sauniere's
message.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
He
fixated
on
two
letters.
P.S.
In
that
instant,
Langdon
felt
Sauniere's
puzzling
mix
of
symbolism
fall
into
stark
focus.
Like
