and
took
it,
his
red
eyes
gleaming
with
the
self
satisfaction
of
vengeance.
Slipping
the
keystone
in
the
pocket
of
his
robe,
Silas
backed
off,
still
holding
Langdon
and
Sophie
at
gunpoint.
Teabing
felt
Remy's
arm
clamp
hard
around
his
neck
as
the
servant
began
backing
out
of
the
building,
dragging
Teabing
with
him,
the
gun
still
pressed
in
his
back.
"Let
him
go,"
Langdon
demanded.
"We're
taking
Mr.
Teabing
for
a
drive,"
Remy
said,
still
backing
up.
"If
you
call
the
police,
he
will
die.
If
you
do
anything
to
interfere,
he
will
die.
Is
that
clear?"
"Take
me,"
Langdon
demanded,
his
voice
cracking
with
emotion.
"Let
Leigh
go."
Remy
laughed.
"I
don't
think
so.
He
and
I
have
such
a
nice
history.
Besides,
he
still
might
prove
useful."
Silas
was
backing
up
now,
keeping
Langdon
and
Sophie
at
gunpoint
as
Remy
pulled
Leigh
toward
the
exit,
his
crutches
dragging
behind
him.
Sophie's
voice
was
unwavering.
"Who
are
you
working
for?"
The
question
brought
a
smirk
to
the
departing
Remy's
face.
"You
would
be
surprised,
Mademoiselle
Neveu."
The
fireplace
in
Chateau
Villette's
drawing
room
was
cold,
but
Collet
paced
before
it
nonetheless
as
he
read
the
faxes
from
Interpol.
