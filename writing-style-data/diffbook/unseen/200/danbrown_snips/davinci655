chosen
Aringarosa
as
the
perfect
pawn
in
his
plan.
After
all,
who
more
likely
to
leap
blindly
after
the
Holy
Grail
than
a
man
like
myself
with
everything
to
lose?
The
Grail
would
have
brought
enormous
power
to
anyone
who
possessed
it.
Leigh
Teabing
had
protected
his
identity
shrewdly
feigning
a
French
accent
and
a
pious
heart,
and
demanding
as
payment
the
one
thing
he
did
not
need
money.
Aringarosa
had
been
far
too
eager
to
be
suspicious.
The
price
tag
of
twenty
million
euro
was
paltry
when
compared
with
the
prize
of
obtaining
the

and
with
the
Vatican's
separation
payment
to
Opus

the
finances
had
worked
nicely.
The
blind
see
what
they
want
to
see.
Teabing's
ultimate
insult,
of
course,
had
been
to
demand
payment
in
Vatican
bonds,
such
that
if
anything
went
wrong,
the
investigation
would
lead
to
Rome.
"I
am
glad
to
see
you're
well,
My
Lord."
Aringarosa
recognized
the
gruff
voice
in
the
doorway,
but
the
face
was
unexpected
stern,
powerful
features,
slicked
back
hair,
and
a
broad
neck
that
strained
against
his
dark
suit.
"Captain
Fache?"
Aringarosa
asked.
The
compassion
and
concern
the
captain
had
shown
for
Aringarosa's
plight
last
night
had
conjured
