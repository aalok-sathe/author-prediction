your
games.
I'm
late,
and
I'm
leaving.
If
it
is
that
important
to
you
to
stop
me,
you'll
just
have
to
shoot
me."
With
that,
Teabing
and
Remy
walked
around
the
chief
inspector
and
headed
across
the
hangar
toward
the
parked
limousine.
The
Kent
chief
inspector
felt
only
distaste
for
Leigh
Teabing
as
the
man
hobbled
around
him
in
defiance.
Men
of
privilege
always
felt
like
they
were
above
the
law.
They
are
not.
The
chief
inspector
turned
and
aimed
at
Teabing's
back.
"Stop!
I
will
fire!"
"Go
ahead,"
Teabing
said
without
breaking
stride
or
glancing
back.
"My
lawyers
will
fricassee
your
testicles
for
breakfast.
And
if
you
dare
board
my
plane
without
a
warrant,
your
spleen
will
follow."
No
stranger
to
power
plays,
the
chief
inspector
was
unimpressed.
Technically,
Teabing
was
correct
and
the
police
needed
a
warrant
to
board
his
jet,
but
because
the
flight
had
originated
in
France,
and
because
the
powerful
Bezu
Fache
had
given
his
authority,
the
Kent
chief
inspector
felt
certain
his
career
would
be
far
better
served
by
finding
out
what
it
was
on
this
plane
that
Teabing
seemed
so
intent
on
hiding.
"Stop
them,"
the
inspector
ordered.
"I'm
searching
the
plane."
