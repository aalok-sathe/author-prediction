be
about
fifty,
with
refined
features
and
an
austere
expression
that
left
little
doubt
he
was
unamused
by
their
presence
here.
"Sir
Leigh
will
be
down
presently,"
he
declared,
his
accent
thick
French.
"He
is
dressing.
He
prefers
not
to
greet
visitors
while
wearing
only
a
nightshirt.
May
I
take
your
coat?"
He
scowled
at
the
bunched
up
tweed
in
Langdon'
s
arms.
"Thank
you,
I'm
fine."
"Of
course
you
are.
Right
this
way,
please."
The
butler
guided
them
through
a
lush
marble
foyer
into
an
exquisitely
adorned
drawing
room,
softly
lit
by
tassel

air
inside
smelled
antediluvian,
regal
somehow,
with
traces
of
pipe

tea

cooking
sherry,
and
the
earthen

of
stone
architecture.
Against
the
far
wall,
flanked
between
two
glistening
suits
of
chain
mail
armor,
was
a
rough
hewn
fireplace
large
enough
to
roast
an
ox.
Walking
to
the
hearth,
the
butler
knelt
and
touched
a
match
to
a
pre
laid
arrangement
of
oak
logs
and
kindling.
A
fire
quickly
crackled
to
life.
The
man
stood,
straightening
his
jacket.
"His
master
requests
that
you
make
yourselves
at
home."
With
that,
he
departed,
leaving
Langdon
and
Sophie
alone.
Sophie
wondered
which
