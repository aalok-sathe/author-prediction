and
stood
beside
him.
"Mr.
Langdon,
when
I
first
heard
of
Jacques's
murder,
I
was
terrified
for
Sophie's
safety.
Seeing
her
standing
in
my
doorway
tonight
was
the
greatest
relief
of
my
life.
I
cannot
thank
you
enough."
Langdon
had
no
idea
how
to
respond.
Although
he
had
offered
to
give
Sophie
and
her
grandmother
time
to
talk
in
private,
Marie
had
asked
him
to
stay
and
listen.
My
husband
obviously
trusted
you,
Mr.
Langdon,
so
I
do
as
well.
And
so
Langdon
had
remained,
standing
beside
Sophie
and
listening
in
mute
astonishment
while
Marie
told
the
story
of
Sophie's
late
parents.
Incredibly,
both
had
been
from
Merovingian
families
direct
descendants
of
Mary
Magdalene
and
Jesus
Christ.
Sophie's
parents
and
ancestors,
for
protection,
had
changed
their
family
names
of
Plantard
and
Saint
Clair.
Their
children
represented
the
most
direct
surviving
royal
bloodline
and
therefore
were
carefully
guarded
by
the
Priory.
When
Sophie's
parents
were
killed
in
a
car
accident
whose
cause
could
not
be
determined,
the
Priory
feared
the
identity
of
the
royal
line
had
been
discovered.
"Your
grandfather
and
I,"
Marie
had
explained
in
a
voice
choked
with
pain,
"had
to
make
a
grave
decision
the
instant
we
received
