had
been
collected
by
a
DCPJ
agent."
Fache
looked
troubled.
"And
the
embassy
contacted
DCPJ
Cryptography?"
"No,
sir,"
Sophie
said,
her
voice
firm.
"When
I
called
the
DCPJ
switchboard
in
an
attempt
to
contact
you,
they
had
a
message
waiting
for
Mr.
Langdon
and
asked
me
to
pass
it
along
if
I
got
through
to
you."
Fache's
brow
furrowed
in
apparent
confusion.
He
opened
his
mouth
to
speak,
but
Sophie
had
already
turned
back
to
Langdon.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
she
declared,

call."
Langdon

the
slip.
It
had
a
Paris
phone
number
and
extension
on
it.
"Thank
you,"
he
said,
feeling
worried
now.
"Where
do
I
find
a
phone?"
Sophie
began
to
pull
a
cell
phone
from
her
sweater
pocket,
but
Fache
waved
her
off.
He
now
looked
like
Mount
Vesuvius
about
to
erupt.
Without
taking
his
eyes
off
Sophie,
he
produced
his
own
cell
phone
and
held
it
out.
"This
