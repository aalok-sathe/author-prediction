my
grandfather's
death!"
Vernet
looked
at
Langdon.
"And
yet
the
radio
claims
you
are
wanted
not
only
for
the
murder
of
Jacques
Sauniere
but
for
those
of
three
other
men
as
well?"
"What!"
Langdon
was
thunderstruck.
Three
more
murders?
The
coincidental
number
hit
him
harder
than
the
fact
that
he
was
the
prime
suspect.
It
seemed
too
unlikely
to
be
a
coincidence.
The
three
senechaux?
Langdon's
eyes
dropped
to
the
rosewood
box.
If
the
senechaux
were
murdered,
Sauniere
had
no
options.
He
had
to
transfer
the
keystone
to
someone.
"The
police
can
sort
that
out
when
I
turn
you
in,"
Vernet
said.
"I
have
gotten
my
bank
involved
too
far
already."
Sophie
glared
at
Vernet.
"You
obviously
have
no
intention
of
turning
us
in.
You
would
have
driven
us
back
to
the
bank.
And
instead
you
bring
us
out
here
and
hold
us
at
gunpoint?"
"Your
grandfather
hired
me
for
one
reason
to
keep
his
possessions
both
safe
and
private.
Whatever
this
box
contains,
I
have
no
intention
of
letting
it
become
a
piece
of
cataloged
evidence
in
a
police
investigation.
Mr.
Langdon,
bring
me
the
box.
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"Don't
do
it."
A
gunshot
roared,
and
a
bullet
