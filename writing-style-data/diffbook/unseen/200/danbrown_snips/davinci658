You
bribed
a
pilot
to
change
course.
In
doing
so,
you
broke
a
number
of
international
laws."
Aringarosa
slumped.
"I
was
desperate."
"Yes.
As
was
the
pilot
when
my
men
interrogated
him."
Fache
reached
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
purple
amethyst
ring
with
a
familiar
hand
tooled
mitre
crozier
applique.
Aringarosa
felt
tears
welling
as
he
accepted
the
ring
and
slipped
it
back
on
his
finger.
"You've
been
so
kind."
He
held
out
his
hand
and
clasped
Fache's.
"Thank
you."
Fache
waved
off
the
gesture,
walking
to
the
window
and
gazing
out
at
the
city,
his
thoughts
obviously
far
away.
When
he
turned,
there
was
an
uncertainty
about
him.
"My
Lord,
where
do
you
go
from
here?"
Aringarosa
had
been
asked
the
exact
same
question
as
he
left
Castel
Gandolfo
the
night
before.
"I
suspect
my
path
is
as
uncertain
as
yours."
"Yes."
Fache
paused.
"I
suspect
I
will
be
retiring
early."
Aringarosa
smiled.
"A
little
faith
can
do
wonders,
Captain.
A
little
faith.
