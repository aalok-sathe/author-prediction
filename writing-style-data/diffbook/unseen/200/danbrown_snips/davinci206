was
interesting."
Sophie
didn't
seem
to
hear.
Her
eyes
remained
fixed
ahead
down
the
long
thoroughfare
of
Champs
Elysees,
the
two
mile
stretch
of
posh
storefronts
that
was
often
called
the
Fifth
Avenue
of
Paris.
The
embassy
was
only
about
a
mile
away,
and
Langdon
settled
into
his
seat.
So
dark
the
con
of
man.
Sophie's
quick
thinking
had
been
impressive.
Madonna
of
the
Rocks.
Sophie
had
said
her
grandfather
left
her
something
behind
the
painting.
A
final
message?
Langdon
could
not
help
but
marvel
over
Sauniere's
brilliant
hiding
place;
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
was
yet
another
fitting
link
in
the
evening's
chain
of
interconnected
symbolism.
Sauniere,
it
seemed,
at
every
turn,
was
reinforcing
his
fondness
for
the
dark
and
mischievous
side
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
Da
Vinci's
original
commission
for
Madonna
of
the
Rocks
had
come
from
an
organization
known
as
the
Confraternity
of
the
Immaculate
Conception,
which
needed
a
painting
for
the
centerpiece
of
an
altar
triptych
in
their
church
of
San
Francesco
in
Milan.
The
nuns
gave
Leonardo
specific
dimensions,
and
the
desired
theme
for
the
painting
the
Virgin
Mary,
baby
John
the
Baptist,
Uriel,
and
Baby
Jesus
sheltering
in
a
cave.
Although
Da
Vinci
did
