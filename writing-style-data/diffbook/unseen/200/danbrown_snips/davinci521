to
him.
"What
do
you
think
we
should
do
with
the
Sangreal
documents
if
we
ever
find
them?"
she
whispered.
"What
I
think
is
immaterial,"
Langdon
said.
"Your
grandfather
gave
the
cryptex
to
you,
and
you
should
do
with
it
what
your
instinct
tells
you
he
would

"I'm

history.
I
certainly
didn't
presume
to
know
where
the

is
hidden
or
whether
it
should
ever
be
revealed.
"And
yet
you're
writing
a
book
about

so
you
obviously

shared."
"There's
an
enormous
difference
between
hypothetically
discussing
an
alternate
history
of
Christ,
