exhumed
corpses
to
study
human
anatomy;
he
kept
mysterious
journals
in
illegible
reverse
handwriting;
he
believed
he
possessed
the
alchemic
power
to
turn
lead
into
gold
and
even
cheat
God
by
creating
an
elixir
to
postpone
death;
and
his
inventions
included
horrific,
never
before
imagined
weapons
of
war
and
torture.
Misunderstanding
breeds
distrust,
Langdon
thought.
Even
Da
Vinci's
enormous
output
of
breathtaking
Christian
art
only
furthered
the
artist's
reputation
for
spiritual
hypocrisy.
Accepting
hundreds
of
lucrative
Vatican
commissions,
Da
Vinci
painted
Christian
themes
not
as
an
expression
of
his
own
beliefs
but
rather
as
a
commercial
venture

means
of
funding

lavish
lifestyle.
Unfortunately,
Da
Vinci
was
a
prankster
who
often
amused
himself
by
quietly
gnawing
at
the
hand
that
fed
him.
He
incorporated
in
many
of
his
Christian
paintings
hidden
symbolism
that
was
anything
but
Christian
tributes
to
his
own
beliefs
and
a
subtle
thumbing
of
his
nose
at
the
Church.
Langdon
had
even
given
a
lecture
once
at
the
National
Gallery
in
London
entitled:
"The
Secret
Life
of
Leonardo:
Pagan
Symbolism
in
Christian
Art."
"I
understand
your
concerns,"
Langdon
now
said,
"but
Da
Vinci
never
really
practiced
any
dark
arts.
He
was
an
exceptionally
