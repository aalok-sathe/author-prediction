Sophie
knew
she
had
been
in
a
hurry
inside
the
Louvre,
but
she
was
certain
she
had
seen
nothing
else
behind
Madonna
of
the
Rocks.
"No.
Just
the
key."
Vernet
gave
a
helpless
sigh.
"I'm
afraid
every
key
is
electronically
paired
with
a
ten
digit
account
number
that
functions
as
a
password.
Without

is
worthless."
Ten

Sophie
reluctantly
calculated
the
cryptographic
odds.
Over
ten
billion
possible
choices.
Even
if

could
bring
in
DCPJ's
most
powerful
parallel

break
the
code.
"Certainly,

circumstances,
you
can
help
us."
"I'm
sorry.
I
truly
can
do
nothing.
Clients
select
their
own
account
numbers
via
a
secure
terminal,
meaning
account
numbers
are
known

to

client
and
computer.
This
is
one
way
we
ensure
anonymity.
And
the
safety
of
our
employees."
Sophie
understood.
Convenience
stores
did
the
same
thing.
EMPLOYEES
DO
NOT
HAVE
KEYS
TO
THE
SAFE.
This
bank
obviously
did
not
want
to
risk
someone
stealing
a
key
and
then
holding
an
employee
hostage
for
the
account
number.
Sophie
sat
down
beside
Langdon,
glanced
down
at
the
key
and
then
up
at
Vernet.
