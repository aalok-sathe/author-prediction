Langdon
said,
smiling.
"I
guess
we
know
what
the
alcohol
smell
was."
Sophie
stared
in
amazement
at
the
purple
writing
on
the
back
of
the
key.
24
Rue
Haxo
An
address!
My
grandfather
wrote
down
an
address!
"Where
is
this?"
Langdon
asked.
Sophie
had
no
idea.
Facing
front
again,
she
leaned
forward
and
excitedly
asked
the
driver,
"Connaissez
vous
la
Rue
Haxo?"
The
driver
thought
a
moment
and
then
nodded.
He
told
Sophie
it
was
out
near
the
tennis
stadium
on
the
western
outskirts
of
Paris.
She
asked
him
to
take
them
there
immediately.
"Fastest
route
is
through
Bois
de
Boulogne,"
the
driver
told
her
in
French.
"Is
that
okay?"
Sophie
frowned.
She
could
think
of
far
less
scandalous
routes,
but
tonight
she
was
not
going
to
be
picky.
"Oui."
We
can
shock
the
visiting
American.
Sophie
looked
back
at
the
key
and
wondered
what
they
would
possibly
find
at
24
Rue
Haxo.
A
church?
Some
kind
of
Priory
headquarters?
Her
mind
filled
again
with
images
of
the
secret
ritual
she
had
witnessed
in
the
basement
grotto
ten
years
ago,
and
she
heaved
a
long
sigh.
"Robert,
I
have
a
lot
of
things
to
tell
you."
She
paused,
locking
eyes
