that
Langdon
could
imagine
was
the
pentacle
of
Venus,
and
he
had
already
tried
the
password
"Venus"
en
route
to
the
Temple
Church.
Sophie
moved
directly
to
the
sarcophagus,
but
Langdon
hung
back
a
few
feet,
keeping
an
eye
on
the
abbey
around
them.
"Divinity,
"
Sophie
said,
tilting
her
head
and
reading
the
titles
of
the
books
on
which
Newton
was
leaning.
"Chronology.
Opticks.
Philosophiae
Naturalis
Principia
Mathematica?"
She
turned
to
him.
"Ring
any
bells?"
Langdon
stepped
closer,
considering
it.
"Principia
Mathematica,
as
I
remember,
has
something
to
do
with
the
gravitation
pull
of
planets
which
admittedly
are
orbs,
but
it
seems
a
little
far
fetched."
"How
about
the
signs
of
the
zodiac?"
Sophie
asked,
pointing
to
the
constellations
on
the
orb.
"You
were
talking
about
Pisces
and
Aquarius
earlier,
weren't
you?"
The
End
of
Days,
Langdon
thought.
"The
end
of
Pisces
and
the
beginning
of
Aquarius
was
allegedly
the
historical
marker
at
which
the
Priory
planned
to
release
the
Sangreal
documents
to
the
world."
But
the
millennium
came
and
went
without
incident,
leaving
historians
uncertain
when
the
truth
was
coming.
"It
seems
possible,"
Sophie
said,
"that
the
Priory's
plans
to
reveal
the
truth
might
be
related
to
the
