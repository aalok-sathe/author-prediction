cracks
or
markings
to
indicate
a
movable
tile,
so
he
began
rapping
softly
with
his
knuckles
on
the
floor.
Following
the
brass
line
closer
to
the
obelisk,
he
knocked
on
each
tile
adjacent
to
the
brass
line.
Finally,
one
of
them
echoed
strangely.
There's
a
hollow
area
beneath
the
floor!
Silas
smiled.
His
victims
had
spoken
the
truth.
Standing,
he
searched
the
sanctuary
for
something
with
which
to
break
the
floor
tile.
High
above
Silas,
in
the
balcony,
Sister
Sandrine
stifled
a
gasp.
Her
darkest
fears
had
just
been
confirmed.
This
visitor
was
not
who
he
seemed.
The
mysterious
Opus
Dei
monk
had
come
to
Saint
Sulpice
for
another
purpose.
A
secret
purpose.
You
are
not
the
only
one
with
secrets,
she
thought.
Sister
Sandrine
Bieil
was
more
than
the
keeper
of
this
church.
She
was
a
sentry.
And
tonight,
the
ancient
wheels
had
been
set
in
motion.
The
arrival
of
this
stranger
at
the
base
of
the
obelisk
was
a
signal
from
the
brotherhood.
It
was
a
silent
call
of
distress.
The
U.S.
Embassy
in
Paris
is
a
compact
complex
on
Avenue
Gabriel,
just
north
of
the
Champs
Elysees.
The
