of
cards,
it
was
collapsing
in
on
itself
and
the
end
was
nowhere
in
sight.
Langdon
could
see
Sophie
was
still
shaken
from
recounting
her
experience
of
Hieros
Gamos.
For
his
part,
Langdon
was
amazed
to
have
heard
it.
Not
only
had
Sophie
witnessed
the
full
blown
ritual,
but
her
own
grandfather
had
been
the
celebrant

seeing
him
in
an

different
light.
Outside,
the
dawn
was
coming

its
crimson
aura
gathering
off
the
starboard.
The
earth
was
still
black
beneath
them.
"Victuals,
my
dears?"
Teabing
rejoined
them
with
a
flourish,
presenting
several
cans
of
Coke
and
a
