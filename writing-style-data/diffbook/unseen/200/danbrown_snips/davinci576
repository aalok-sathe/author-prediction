felt
intrigued
and
found
herself
pondering
the
verse
carefully.
"According
to
this
rhyme,
a
knight
did
something
that
incurred
displeasure
with
God,
and
yet
a
Pope
was
kind
enough
to
bury
him
in
London."
Langdon
nodded.
"Does
it
ring
any
bells?"
Gettum
moved
toward
one
of
the
workstations.
"Not
offhand,
but
let's
see
what
we
can
pull
up
in
the
database."
Over
the
past
two
decades,
King's
College
Research
Institute
in
Systematic
Theology
had
used
optical
character
recognition
software
in
unison
with
linguistic
translation
devices
to
digitize
and
catalog

histories,
Vatican
letters,
diaries

qualified
as
writings
on
human
spirituality.
Because
the
massive
collection
was
now
in
the
form
of
bits
and
bytes
rather
than
physical
pages,
the
data
was
infinitely
more
accessible.
Settling
into
one
of
the
workstations,
Gettum
eyed
the
slip
of
paper
and
began
typing.
"To
begin,
we'll
run
a
straight
Boolean
with
a
few
obvious
keywords
and
see
what
happens."
"Thank
you."
Gettum
typed
in
a
few
words:
LONDON,
KNIGHT,
POPE
