next
candidate
to
ascend
as
senechal.
Rather
than
telling
the
new
senechal
where
the
Grail
was
hidden,
they
gave
him
a
test
through
which
he
could
prove
he
was
worthy."
Sophie
looked
unsettled
by
this,
and
Langdon
suddenly
recalled
her
mentioning
how
her
grandfather
used
to
make
treasure
hunts
for
her
preuves

Admittedly,
the
keystone
was
a
similar
concept.
Then
again,
tests
like
this
were
extremely
common
in
secret
societies.
The
best
known
was
the
Masons',
wherein

candidate's
induction
as
thirty

can
open
it,
he
proves
himself
worthy
of
the
information
it
holds."
Langdon
nodded.
"I
forgot
you'd
had
experience
with
this
sort
of
thing."
"Not
only
with
my
grandfather.
In
cryptology,
that's
called
a
'self
authorizing
language.'
That
is,
if
you're
smart
enough
to
read
it,
you're
permitted
to
know
what
is
being
said.
Langdon
hesitated
a
moment.
"Sophie,
you
