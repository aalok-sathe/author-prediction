seat
of
the
parked
Jaguar
limousine
near
the
Temple
Church.
His
hands
felt
damp
on
the
keystone
as
he
waited
for
Remy
to
finish
tying
and
gagging
Teabing
in
back
with
the
rope
they
had
found
in
the
trunk.
Finally,
Remy
climbed
out
of
the
rear
of
the
limo,
walked
around,
and
slid
into
the
driver's
seat
beside
Silas.
"Secure?"
Silas
asked.
Remy
chuckled,
shaking
off
the
rain
and
glancing
over
his
shoulder
through
the
open
partition
at
the
crumpled
form
of
Leigh
Teabing,
who
was
barely

shadows
in
the
rear.
"He's

old
duct

to
gag
him.
"Ferme

Remy
shouted
over
his
shoulder
at
Teabing.
Reaching
to
a
control
panel
on
the
elaborate
dash,
Remy
pressed
a
button.
An
opaque
partition
raised
behind
them,
sealing
off
the
back.
Teabing
disappeared,
and
his
voice
was
silenced.
Remy
glanced
at
Silas.
"I've
been
listening
to
his
miserable
whimpering
long
enough."
Minutes
later,
as
the
Jaguar
stretch
limo
powered
through
the
streets,
Silas's
cell
phone
rang.
The
Teacher.
He
answered
excitedly.
"Hello?"
"Silas,"
the
Teacher's
familiar
French
accent
said,
"I
