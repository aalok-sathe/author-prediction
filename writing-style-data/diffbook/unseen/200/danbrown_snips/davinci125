air
bed
was
covered
with
a
vinyl
tarp,
roughly
resembling
a
giant
hammock.
Fache
felt
a
shiver
of
apprehension.
That
truck,
only
moments
ago,
had
probably
been
stopped
at
a
red
light
directly
beneath
the
rest
room
window.
An
insane
risk,
Fache
told
himself.
Langdon
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
truck
was
carrying
beneath
that
tarp.
What
if
the
truck
were
carrying
steel?
Or
cement?
Or
even
garbage?
A
forty
foot
leap?
It
was
madness.
"The
dot
is

Collet
called.
"He's
turning
right
on

thought.
Amazed,
he
watched
the
truck
disappear
around
the
corner.
Collet
was
already
radioing
the
agents
outside,
pulling
them
off
the
Louvre
perimeter
and
sending
them
to
their
patrol
cars
in
pursuit,
all
the
while
broadcasting
the
truck's
changing
location
like
some
kind
of
bizarre
play
by
play.
It's
over,
Fache
knew.
His
men
would
have
the
truck
surrounded
within
minutes.
Langdon
was
not
going
anywhere.
Stowing
his
weapon,
Fache
exited
the
rest
room
and
radioed
Collet.
"Bring
my
car
around.
