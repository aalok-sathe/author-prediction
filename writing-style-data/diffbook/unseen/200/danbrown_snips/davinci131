your
interests
in
the
church

architectural
or
historical?"
"Actually,
Sister,
my
interests
are
spiritual."
She
gave
a
pleasant
laugh.
"That
goes
without
saying.
I
simply
wondered
where
to
begin
your
tour."
Silas
felt
his
eyes
focus
on
the
altar.
"A
tour
is
unnecessary.
You
have
been
more

I
can
show
myself
around.
"It
is
no
trouble,"
she
said.
"After
all,
I
am
awake."
Silas
stopped
walking.
They
had
reached
the

to

before
I
look
around?"
Sister
Sandrine
hesitated.
"Oh,
of
course.
I
shall
wait
in
the
rear
of
the
church
for
you."
Silas
put
a
soft
but
heavy
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
peered
down.
"Sister,
I
feel
guilty
already
for
having
awoken
