the
obelisk.
The
shaft
would
do
nicely
as
a
battering
ram.
Eyeing
the
gray
marble
panel
that
covered
the
apparent
hollow
in
the
floor,
he
realized
he
could
not
possibly
shatter
the
covering
without
making
considerable
noise.
Iron
on
marble.
It
would
echo
off
the
vaulted
ceilings.
Would
the
nun
hear
him?
She
should
be
asleep
by
now.
Even
so,
it
was
a
chance
Silas
preferred
not
to
take.
Looking
around
for
a
cloth
to
wrap
around
the
tip
of
the
iron
pole,
he
saw
nothing
except
the

Silas
untied

the
fresh
wounds
on
his
back.
Naked
now,
except
for
his
loin
swaddle,
Silas
wrapped
his
cloak
over
the
end
of
the
iron
rod.
Then,
aiming
at
the
center
of
the
floor
tile,
he
drove
the
tip
into
it.
A
muffled
thud.
The
stone
did
not
break.
He
drove
the
pole
into
it
again.
Again
a
dull
thud,
but
this
time
accompanied
by
a
crack.
On
