the
Church,
but
she
also
had
physical
proof
that
the
Church's
newly
proclaimed
deity
had
spawned
a
mortal
bloodline.
The
Church,
in
order
to
defend
itself
against
the
Magdalene's
power,
perpetuated
her
image
as
a
whore
and
buried
evidence
of
Christ's
marriage
to
her,
thereby
defusing
any
potential
claims
that
Christ
had
a
surviving
bloodline
and
was
a
mortal
prophet."
Sophie
glanced
at
Langdon,
who
nodded.
"Sophie,
the
historical
evidence
supporting
this
is
substantial."
"I
admit,"
Teabing
said,
"the
assertions
are
dire,
but
you
must
understand
the
Church's
powerful
motivations
to
conduct
such
a
cover
up.
They
could
never
have
survived
public
knowledge
of
a
bloodline.
A
child
of
Jesus
would
undermine
the
critical
notion
of
Christ's
divinity
and
therefore
the
Christian
Church,
which
declared
itself
the
sole
vessel
through
which
humanity
could
access
the
divine
and
gain
entrance
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven."
"The
five
petal
rose,"
Sophie
said,
pointing
suddenly
to
the
spine
of
one
of
Teabing's
books.
The
same
exact
design
inlaid
on
the
rosewood
box.
Teabing
glanced
at
Langdon
and
grinned.
"She
has
a
good
eye."
He
turned
back
to
Sophie.
"That
is
the
Priory
symbol
for
the
Grail.
Mary
Magdalene.

was
