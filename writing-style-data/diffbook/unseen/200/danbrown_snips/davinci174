The
embassy's
night
operator
was
reading
Time
magazine's
International
Edition
when
the
sound
of
her
phone
interrupted.
"U.S.
Embassy,"
she
answered.
"Good
evening."
The
caller

English
accented

French.
"I

some
assistance."
Despite
the
politeness
of
the
man's

"You

would
be
handwritten
in
our
services
department.
What
was
your
name
again?"
But
the
man

Bezu
