along
with
many
others.
But
Grand
Master,
you
say?
It's
hard
to
fathom."
Teabing
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
shook
his
head.
"But
it
still
makes
no
sense.
Even
if
your
grandfather
were
the
Priory
Grand
Master
and
created
the
keystone
himself,
he
would
never
tell
you
how
to
find
it.
The
keystone
reveals
the
pathway
to
the
brotherhood's
ultimate
treasure.
Granddaughter
or
not,
you
are
not
eligible
to
receive
such
knowledge."
"Mr.
Sauniere
was
dying
when
he
passed
on
the
information,"
Langdon
said.
"He
had
limited
options."
"He
didn't
need
options,"
Teabing
argued.
"There
exist
three
senechaux
who
also
know
the
secret.
That
is
the
beauty
of
their
system.
One
will
rise
to
Grand
Master
and
they
will
induct
a
new
senechal
and
share
the
secret
of
the
keystone."
"I
guess
you
didn't
see
the
entire
news
broadcast,"
Sophie
said.
"In
addition
to
my
grandfather,
three
other
prominent
Parisians
were
murdered
today.
All
in
similar
ways.
All
looked
like
they
had
been
interrogated."
Teabing's
jaw
fell.
"And
you
think
they
were"
"The
senechaux,
"
Langdon
said.
"But
how?
A
murderer
could
not
possibly
learn
the
identities
of
all
four
top
members
of
the
Priory
of
Sion!
