there,
silent,
staring
at
the
mysterious
container.
Like
everything
else
about
this
bank,
this
crate
was
industrial
metal
clasps,
a
bar
code
sticker
on
top,
and
molded
heavy
duty
handle.
Sophie
thought
it
looked
like
a
giant
toolbox.
Wasting
no
time,
Sophie
unhooked
the
two
buckles
facing
her.
Then
she
glanced
over
at
Langdon.
Together,
they
raised
the
heavy
lid
and
let
it
fall
back.
Stepping
forward,
they
peered
down
into
the
crate.
At
first
glance,
Sophie
thought
the
crate
was
empty.
Then
she
saw
something.
Sitting
at
the
bottom
of
the
crate.
A
lone
item.
The
polished
wooden
box
was
about
the
size
of
a
shoebox
and
had
ornate
hinges.
The
wood
was
a
lustrous
deep
purple
with
a
strong
grain.
Rosewood,
Sophie
realized.
Her
grandfather's
favorite.
The
lid
bore
a
beautiful
inlaid
design
of
a
rose.
She
and
Langdon
exchanged
puzzled
looks.
Sophie
leaned
in
and
grabbed
the
box,
lifting
it
out.
My
God,
it's
heavy!
She
carried
it
gingerly
to
a
large
receiving
table
and
set
it
down.
Langdon
stood
beside
her,
both
of
them
staring
at
the
small
treasure
chest
her
grandfather
apparently
had
sent
them
to
retrieve.
Langdon
stared
in
wonderment
at
the
lid's
hand
