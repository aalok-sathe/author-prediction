the
password,"
she
argued.
"The
cryptex
doesn't
have
an
Sh
on
the
dial.
It
uses
a
traditional
Roman
alphabet.
"Read
the
word,"
Langdon
urged.
"Keep
in
mind
two
things.
In
Hebrew,
the
symbol
for
the
sound
Sh
can
also
be
pronounced
as
S,
depending
on
the
accent.
Just
as
the
letter
P
can
be
pronounced
F."
SVFYA?
she
thought,
puzzled.
"Genius!"
Teabing
added.
"The
letter
Vav
is
often
a
placeholder
for
the
vowel
sound
O!"
Sophie
again
looked
at
the
letters,
attempting
to
sound
them
out.
"Sofya."
She
heard
the
sound
of
her

had
just
said.
"Sophia?
This
spells
Sophia?"
Langdon
was
nodding
enthusiastically.
"Yes!
Sophia
literally
means
wisdom
in
Greek.
The
root
of
your
name,
Sophie,
is
literally
a
'word
of
wisdom.'
Sophie
suddenly
missed
her
grandfather
immensely.
He
encrypted
the
Priory
keystone
with
my
name.
A
knot
caught
in
her
throat.
It
all
seemed
so
perfect.
But
as
she
turned
her
gaze
to
the
five
lettered
dials
on
the
cryptex,
she
realized
a
problem
still
existed.
"But
wait
the
word
Sophia
has
six
letters."
Teabing's
smile
never
faded.
"Look
at
the
poem
again.
Your
grandfather
wrote,
'An
