name
of
your
bank
has
not
appeared
in
the
media.
So
what
precisely
is
your
concern?"
Vernet's
voice
was
anxious
as
he
told
Fache
how
Langdon
and
Sophie
had
extracted
a
small
wooden
box
from
the
bank
and
then
persuaded
Vernet
to
help
them
escape.
"Then
when
I
heard
on
the
radio
that
they
were
criminals,"
Vernet
said,
"I
pulled
over
and
demanded
the
box
back,
but
they
attacked
me
and
stole
the
truck.
"You
are
concerned
for
a
wooden
box,"
Fache
said,
eyeing
the
Rose
inlay
on
the
cover
and
again
gently
opening
the
lid
to
reveal
the
white
cylinder.
"Can
you
tell
me
what
was
in
the
box?"
"The
contents
are
immaterial,"
Vernet
fired
back.
"I
am
concerned
with
the
reputation
of
my
bank.
We
have
never
had
a
robbery.
Ever.
It
will
ruin
us
if
I
cannot
recover
this
property
on
behalf
of
my
client."
"You
said
Agent
Neveu
and
Robert
Langdon
had
a
password
and
a
key.
What
makes
you
say
they
stole
the
box?"
"They
murdered
people
tonight.
Including
Sophie
Neveu's
grandfather.
The
key
and
password
were
obviously
ill
gotten."
"Mr.
Vernet,
my
men
have
done
some
checking
into
your
background
and
your
interests.
You
