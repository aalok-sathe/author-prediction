in
horror
as
he
watched
the
priceless
Da

stretching.
The
woman
was
pushing
her
knee
into
the
center
of
the
canvas
from
behind!
"NON!"
Grouard
wheeled
and
aimed
his
gun
at
her
but
instantly
realized
it
was
an
empty
threat.
The
canvas
was
only
fabric,
but
it
was
utterly
impenetrable

"Set
down
your
gun
and

the
woman
said
in
calm
French,
"or

put
my

would

Grouard

He
dropped
his

"Thank

"Now

everything
will
work

Neither

since
leaving
the

The
