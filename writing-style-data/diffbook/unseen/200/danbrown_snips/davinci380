that.
The
stakes
were
far
greater
than
mere
affection.
At
this
point
in
the
gospels,
Jesus
suspects
He
will
soon
be
captured
and
crucified.
So
He
gives
Mary
Magdalene
instructions
on
how
to
carry
on
His
Church
after
He
is
gone.
As
a
result,
Peter
expresses
his
discontent
over
playing
second
fiddle
to
a
woman.
I
daresay
Peter
was
something
of
a
sexist."
Sophie
was
trying
to
keep
up.
"This
is
Saint
Peter.
The
rock
on
which
Jesus
built
His
Church."
"The
same,
except
for
one
catch.
According
to
these
unaltered
gospels,
it
was
not
Peter
to
whom
Christ
gave
directions
with
which
to
establish
the
Christian
Church.
It
was
Mary
Magdalene.
Sophie
looked
at
him.
"You're
saying
the
Christian
Church
was
to
be
carried
on
by
a
woman?"
"That
was
the
plan.
Jesus
was
the
original
feminist.
He
intended
for
the
future
of
His
Church
to
be
in
the
hands
of
Mary
Magdalene."
"And
Peter
had
a
problem
with
that,"
Langdon
said,
pointing
to
The
Last
Supper.
"That's
Peter
there.
You
can
see
that
Da
Vinci
was
well
aware
of
how
Peter
felt
about
Mary
Magdalene."
Again,
Sophie
was
speechless.
In
the
painting,
Peter
was
leaning
menacingly
toward
Mary
