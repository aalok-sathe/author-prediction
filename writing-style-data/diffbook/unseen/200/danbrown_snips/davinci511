men
raced
over,
guns
leveled,
and
physically
blocked
Teabing
and
his
servant
from
reaching
the
limousine.
Now
Teabing
turned.
"Inspector,
this
is
your
last
warning.
Do
not
even
think
of
boarding
that
plane.
You
will
regret
it."
Ignoring
the
threat,
the
chief
inspector
gripped
his
sidearm
and
marched
up
the
plane's
gangway.
Arriving
at
the
hatch,
he
peered
inside.
After
a
moment,
he
stepped
into
the
cabin.
What
the
devil?
With
the
exception
of
the
frightened
looking
pilot
in
the
cockpit,
the
aircraft
was
empty.
Entirely
devoid
of
human
life.
Quickly
checking
the
bathroom,
the
chairs,
and
the
luggage
areas,
the
inspector
found
no
traces
of
anyone
hiding
much
less
multiple
individuals.
What
the
hell
was
Bezu
Fache
thinking?
It
seemed
Leigh
Teabing
had
been
telling
the
truth.
The
Kent
chief
inspector
stood
alone
in
the
deserted
cabin
and
swallowed
hard.
Shit.
His
face
flushed,
he
stepped
back
onto
the
gangway,
gazing
across
the
hangar
at
Leigh
Teabing
and
his
servant,
who
were
now
under
gunpoint
near
the
limousine.
"Let
them
go,"
the
inspector
ordered.
"We
received
a
bad
tip."
Teabing's
eyes
were
menacing
even
across
the
hangar.
"You
can
expect
a
call
from
my
lawyers.
And
for
future
reference,
