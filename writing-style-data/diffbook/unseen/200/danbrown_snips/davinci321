tore
into
the
wall
above
him.
The
reverberation
shook
the
back
of
the
truck
as
a
spent
shell
clinked
onto
the
cargo
floor.
Shit!
Langdon
froze.
Vernet
spoke
more
confidently
now.
"Mr.
Langdon,
pick
up
the
box."
Langdon
lifted
the
box.
"Now
bring
it
over
to
me."
Vernet
was
taking
dead
aim,
standing
on
the
ground
behind
the
rear
bumper,
his
gun
outstretched
into
the
cargo
hold
now.
Box
in
hand,
Langdon
moved
across
the
hold
toward
the
open
door.
I've
got
to
do
something!
Langdon
thought.
I'm
about
to
hand
over
the
Priory
keystone!
As
Langdon
moved
toward
the
doorway,
his
position
of
higher
ground
became
more
pronounced,
and
he
began
wondering
if
he
could
somehow
use
it
to
his
advantage.
Vernet's
gun,
though
raised,
was
at
Langdon's
knee
level.
A
well
placed
kick
perhaps?
Unfortunately,
as
Langdon
neared,
Vernet
seemed
to
sense
the
dangerous
dynamic
developing,
and
he
took
several
steps
back,
repositioning
himself
six
feet
away.
Well
out
of
reach.
Vernet
commanded,
"Place
the
box
beside
the
door."
Seeing
no
options,
Langdon
knelt
down
and
set
the
rosewood
box
at
the
edge
of
the
cargo
hold,
directly
in
front
of
the
open
doors.
"Now
stand
up."
Langdon
