He
was
a

man
in

with

"I'm
about
to
close
up
for
the
day.
May
I
help
you
find
anything?"
How
about
the
Holy
Grail?
Langdon
wanted
to
say.
"The
code,"
Sophie
blurted,
in
sudden
revelation.
"There's
a
code
here!"
The
docent

unfathomable
proportion.
Some

chapel.
Others
believed
it
told
the
true
Grail
legend.
Not
that
it

cryptographers
had
been
trying
for
centuries
to
decipher
its
meaning.
To
