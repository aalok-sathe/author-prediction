sangre
meaning
'blood'?"
Langdon
nodded.
Blood
was
the
backbone
of
the
Sangreal,
and
yet
not
in
the
way
Sophie
probably
imagined.
"The
legend
is
complicated,
but
the
important
thing
to
remember
is
that
the
Priory
guards
the
proof,
and
is
purportedly
awaiting
the
right
moment
in
history
to
reveal
the
truth."
"What
truth?
What
secret
could
possibly
be
that
powerful?"
Langdon
took
a
deep
breath
and
gazed

"Sophie,
the

He
paused.

Sangreal."
Sophie
looked
skeptical.
"I've
never

of
it."
"Sure
you
have."
Langdon
smiled.
"You're
just
used
to
hearing
it
called
by
the
name
'Holy
Grail.'
Sophie
scrutinized
Langdon
in
the
back
of
the
taxi.
He's
joking.
"The
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon
nodded,
his
expression
serious.
"Holy
Grail
is
the
literal
meaning
of
Sangreal.
The
phrase
derives
from
the
French
Sangraal,
which
evolved
to
Sangreal,
and
was
eventually
split
into
two
words,
