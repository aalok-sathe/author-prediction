Two
months
ago,
an
Opus
Dei
group
at
a
midwestern
university
had
been
caught
drugging
new
recruits
with
mescaline
in
an
effort
to
induce
a
euphoric
state
that
neophytes
would
perceive
as
a
religious
experience.
Another
university
student
had
used
his
barbed
cilice
belt
more
often
than
the
recommended
two
hours
a
day
and
had
given
himself
a
near
lethal
infection.
In
Boston
not
long
ago,
a
disillusioned
young
investment
banker
had
signed
over
his
entire
life
savings
to
Opus
Dei
before
attempting
suicide.
Misguided
sheep,
Aringarosa
thought,
his
heart
going
out
to
them.
Of
course
the
ultimate
embarrassment
had
been
the
widely
publicized
trial
of
FBI
spy
Robert
Hanssen,
who,
in
addition
to
being
a
prominent
member
of
Opus
Dei,
had
turned
out
to
be
a
sexual
deviant,
his
trial
uncovering
evidence
that
he
had
rigged
hidden
video
cameras
in
his
own
bedroom
so
his
friends
could
watch
him
having
sex
with
his
wife.
"Hardly
the
pastime
of
a
devout
Catholic,"
the
judge
had
noted.
Sadly,
all
of
these
events
had
helped
spawn
the
new
watch
group
known
as
the
Opus
Dei
Awareness
Network
(ODAN).
The
group's
popular
website
www.odan.org
relayed
frightening
stories
from
former
Opus
Dei
members
who
