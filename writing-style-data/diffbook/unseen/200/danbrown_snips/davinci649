The
dials
were
no
longer
at
random.
They
spelled
a
five
letter
word:
APPLE.
"The
orb
from
which
Eve
partook,"
Langdon
said
coolly,
"incurring
the
Holy
wrath
of
God.
Original
sin.
The
symbol
of
the
fall
of
the
sacred
feminine."
Teabing
felt
the
truth
come
crashing
down
on
him
in
excruciating
austerity.
The
orb
that
ought
be
on
Newton's
tomb
could
be
none
other
than
the
Rosy
apple
that
fell
from
heaven,
struck
Newton
on
the
head,
and
inspired
his
life's
work.
His
labor's
fruit!
The
Rosy
flesh
with
a
seeded
womb!
"Robert,"
Teabing
stammered,
overwhelmed.
"You
opened
it.
Where

the
map?"
Without
blinking,
Langdon
reached
into
the
breast
pocket
of
his
tweed
coat
and
carefully
extracted
a
delicate
rolled
papyrus.
Only
a
few

from
where
Teabing
lay,
Langdon
unrolled
the
scroll
and
looked
at
it.
After
a
long
moment,
a
knowing
smile
crossed
Langdon's
face.
He
knows!
Teabing's
heart
craved
that
knowledge.
His
life's
dream
was
right
in
front
of
him.
"Tell
me!"
Teabing
demanded.
"Please!
Oh
God,
please!
It's
not
too
late!"
As
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
thundered
down
the
hall
toward
the
Chapter
House,
Langdon
quietly
rolled
the
papyrus
and
slipped
it
back
in
