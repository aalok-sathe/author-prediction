the
astonishing
property
of
approaching
the
number
1.618
PHI!
Despite
PHI's
seemingly
mystical
mathematical
origins,
Langdon
explained,
the
truly
mind
boggling
aspect
of
PHI
was
its
role
as
a
fundamental
building
block
in
nature.
Plants,
animals,
and
even
human
beings
all
possessed
dimensional
properties
that
adhered
with
eerie
exactitude
to
the
ratio
of
PHI
to
1.
"PHI's
ubiquity
in
nature,"
Langdon
said,
killing
the
lights,
"clearly
exceeds
coincidence,
and
so
the
ancients
assumed
the
number
PHI
must
have
been
preordained
by
the
Creator
of
the
universe.
Early
scientists
heralded
one
point
six
one
eight
as
the
Divine
Proportion.
"Hold
on,"
said
a
young
woman
in
the
front
row.
"I'm
a
bio
major
and
I've
never
seen
this
Divine
Proportion
in
nature."
"No?"
Langdon
grinned.
"Ever
study
the
relationship
between
females
and
males
in
a
honeybee
community?"
"Sure.
The
female
bees
always
outnumber
the
male
bees."
"Correct.
And
did
you
know
that
if
you
divide
the
number
of
female
bees
by
the
number
of
male
bees
in
any
beehive
in
the
world,
you
always
get
the
same
number?"
"You
do?"
"Yup.
PHI."
The
girl
gaped.
"NO
WAY!"
"Way!"
Langdon
fired
back,
smiling
as
he
projected
a
slide
of
a
spiral
seashell.
