and
I
are
in
grave
danger."
Sophie
stared
at
the
answering
machine.
Danger?
What
was
he
talking
about?
"Princess"
Her
grandfather's
voice
cracked
with
an
emotion
Sophie
could
not
place.
"I
know
I've
kept
things
from
you,
and
I
know
it
has
cost
me
your
love.
But
it
was
for
your
own
safety.
Now
you
must
know
the
truth.
Please,

Sophie

was
only
four.
Their
car
went

longing
through
her
bones.
My
family!
In
that
fleeting
instant,
Sophie
saw
images
from
the
dream
that
had
awoken
her
countless
times
when
she
was
a
little
girl:
My
family
is
alive!
They
are
coming
home!
But,
as
in
her
dream,
the
pictures
evaporated
into
oblivion.
Your
family
is
dead,
Sophie.
They
are
not
coming
home.
"Sophie"
her
grandfather
said
on
the
machine.
"I
