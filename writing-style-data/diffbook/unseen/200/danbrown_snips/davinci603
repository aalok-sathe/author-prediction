the
narthex
at
the
bottom
of
the
nave.
Moreover,
the
abbey
had
a
series
of
sprawling
cloisters
attached.
One
false
step
through
the
wrong
archway,
and
a
visitor
was
lost
in
a
labyrinth
of
outdoor
passageways
surrounded
by
high
walls.
"Docents
wear
crimson
robes,"
Langdon
said,
approaching
the
center
of
the
church.
Peering
obliquely
across
the
towering
gilded
altar
to
the
far
end
of
the
south
transept,
Langdon
saw
several
people
crawling
on
their
hands
and
knees.
This
prostrate
pilgrimage
was
a
common
occurrence
in
Poets'
Corner,
although
it
was
far
less
holy
than
it
appeared.
Tourists

"I
don't
see
any
docents,"
Sophie
said.
"Maybe
we
can
find
the
tomb
on
our
own?"
Without
a
word,
Langdon
led
her
another
few
steps
to
the
center
of
the
abbey
and
pointed
to
the
right.
Sophie
drew
a
startled
breath
as
she
looked
down
the
length
of
the
abbey's
nave,
the
full
magnitude
of
the
building
now
visible.
"Aah,"
she
said.
"Let's
find
a
docent."
At
that
moment,
a
hundred
yards
down
the
nave,
out
of
sight
behind
the
choir
screen,
the
stately
tomb
of
Sir
Isaac
Newton
had
a
lone
visitor.

scrutinizing
