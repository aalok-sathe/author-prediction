had
a
similar
thought.
"Robert,
perhaps
this
is
the
moment
for
the
symbologist
to
clarify?"
He
went
to
a
nearby
end
table,
found
a
piece
of
paper,
and
laid
it
in
front
of
Langdon.
Langdon
pulled
a
pen
from
his
pocket.
"Sophie,
are
you
familiar
with
the
modern
icons
for
male
and
female?"
He
drew
the
common
male
symbol
c?
and
female
symbol
.
"Of
course,"
she
said.
"These,"
he
said
quietly,
"are
not
the

the

male,
"
he
told
her.
"A
rudimentary
phallus."
"Quite
to
the
point,"
Sophie
said.
"As
it
were,"
Teabing
added.
Langdon
went
on.
"This
icon
is
formally
known
as
the
blade,
and
it
represents
aggression
and
manhood.
In
fact,
this
exact
phallus
symbol
is
still
used
today
on
modern
military
uniforms
to
denote
rank."
"Indeed."
Teabing
grinned.
