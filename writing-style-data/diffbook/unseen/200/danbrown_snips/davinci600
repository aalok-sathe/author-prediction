entrance.
Stepping
across
the
threshold
into
Westminster
Abbey,
Langdon
felt
the
outside
world
evaporate
with
a
sudden
hush.
No
rumble
of
traffic.
No
hiss
of
rain.
Just
a
deafening
silence,
which
seemed
to
reverberate
back
and
forth
as
if
the
building
were
whispering
to
itself.
Langdon's
and
Sophie's
eyes,
like
those
of
almost
every
visitor,
shifted
immediately
skyward,
where
the
abbey's
great
abyss
seemed
to
explode
overhead.
Gray
stone
columns
ascended
like
redwoods
into
the
shadows,
arching
gracefully
over
dizzying
expanses,
and
then
shooting
back
down
to
the
stone
floor.
Before
them,
the
wide
alley
of
the
north
transept
stretched
out
like
a
deep
canyon,
flanked
by
sheer
cliffs
of
stained
glass.
On
sunny
days,
the
abbey
floor
was
a
prismatic
patchwork
of
light.
Today,
the
rain
and
darkness
gave
this
massive
hollow
a
wraithlike
aura
more
like
that
of
the
crypt
it
truly
was.
"It's
practically
empty,"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
felt
disappointed.
He
had
hoped
for
a
lot
more
people.
A
more
public
place.
Their
earlier
experience
in
the
deserted
Temple
Church
was
not
one
Langdon
wanted
to
repeat.
He
had
been
anticipating
a
certain
feeling
of
security
in
the
popular
tourist
destination,
but
Langdon's
recollections
of
bustling
throngs
