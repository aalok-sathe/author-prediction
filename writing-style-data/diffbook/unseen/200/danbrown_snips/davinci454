not
intend
to
make
their
secret
known
very
soon,
why
has
the
Church
now
attacked?"
Sophie
argued,
"The
monk
has
not
yet
told
us
his
purpose."
"The
monk's
purpose
is
the
Church's
purpose,"
Teabing
replied,
"to
destroy
the
documents
that
reveal
the
great
deception.
The
Church
came
closer
tonight
than
they
have
ever
come,
and
the
Priory
has
put
its
trust
in
you,
Miss
Neveu.
The
task
of
saving
the
Holy
Grail
clearly
includes
carrying
out
the
Priory's
final
wishes
of
sharing
the
truth
with
the
world.
Langdon
intervened.
"Leigh,
asking
Sophie
to
make
that
decision
is
quite
a
load
to
drop
on
someone
who
only
an
hour
ago
learned
the
Sangreal
documents
exist."
Teabing
sighed.
"I
apologize
if
I
am
pressing,
Miss
Neveu.
Clearly
I
have
always
believed
these
documents
should
be
made
public,
but
in
the
end
the
decision
belongs
to
you.
I
simply
feel
it
is
important
that
you
begin
to
think
about
what
happens
should
we
succeed
in
opening
the
keystone."
"Gentlemen,"
Sophie
said,
her
voice
firm.
"To
quote
your
words,
'You
do
not
find
the
Grail,
the
Grail
finds
you.'
I
am
going
to
trust
that
the
Grail
has
found
me
for
a
reason,
and
