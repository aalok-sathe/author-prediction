The
late
French
president
who
had
commissioned
the
pyramid
was
said
to
have
suffered
from
a
"Pharaoh
complex."
Singlehandedly
responsible
for
filling
Paris
with
Egyptian
obelisks,
art,
and
artifacts.
Francois
Mitterrand
had
an
affinity
for
Egyptian
culture
that
was
so
all
consuming
that
the
French
still
referred
to
him
as
the
Sphinx.
"What
is
the
captain's
name?"
Langdon
asked,
changing
topics.
"Bezu

the
driver
said,

Monsieur

My
French
stinks,
Langdon
thought,
but
my
zodiac
iconography
is
pretty
good.
Taurus
was
always
the
bull.
Astrology
was
a
symbolic
constant
all
over
the
world.
The
agent
pulled
the
car
to
a
stop
and
pointed
between
two
fountains
to
a
large
door
in
the
side
of
the
pyramid.
"There
is
the
entrance.
Good
luck,
monsieur."
"You're
not
coming?"
"My
orders
are
to
leave
you
here.
I
have
other
business
to
attend
to."
Langdon
heaved
a
sigh
and
climbed
out.
It's

circus.
The
agent
revved
his
engine
and
