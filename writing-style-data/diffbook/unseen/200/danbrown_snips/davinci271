small

he
was
watching
and
greeted
them
with
a
pleasant
smile.
Despite
his
enormous
muscles
and
visible
sidearm,
his
diction
chimed
with
the
polished
courtesy
of
a
Swiss
bellhop.
"Bonsoir,
"
he
said.
"How
may
I
help
you?"
The
dual
language
greeting
was
the
newest
hospitality
trick
of
the
European
host.
It
presumed
nothing
and
opened
the
door
for
the
guest
to
reply
in
whichever
language
was
more
comfortable.
Sophie
replied
with
neither.
She
simply
laid
the
gold
key
on
the
counter
in
front
of
the
man.
The
man
glanced
down
and
immediately
stood
straighter.
"Of
course.
Your
elevator
is
at
the
end
of
the
hall.
I
will
alert
someone
that
you
are
on
your
way."
Sophie
nodded
and
took
her
key
back.
"Which
floor?"
The
man
gave
her
an
odd
look.
"Your
key
instructs
the
elevator
which
floor."
She
smiled.
"Ah,
yes."
The
guard
watched
as
the
two
newcomers
made
their
way
to
the
elevators,
inserted
their
key,
boarded
the
lift,
and
disappeared.
As
soon
as
the
door
had
closed,
he
grabbed
the
phone.
He
was
not
calling
to
alert
anyone
of
their
arrival;
there
was
no
need
for
that.
A
vault
greeter
already
had
been
alerted
