with
an
umbrella.
"Bishop
Aringarosa?
Captain
Fache
had
to
leave.
He
asked
me
to
look
after
you.
He
suggested
I
take
you
to
Scotland
Yard.
He
thought
it
would
be
safest."
Safest?
Aringarosa
looked
down
at
the
heavy
briefcase
of
Vatican
bonds
clutched
in
his
hand.
He
had
almost
forgotten.
"Yes,
thank
you."
Aringarosa
climbed
into
the
police
car,
wondering
where
Silas
could
be.
Minutes
later,
the
police
scanner
crackled
with
the
answer.
5
Orme
Court.
Aringarosa
recognized
the
address
instantly.
The
Opus
Dei
Centre
in
London.
He
spun
to
the
driver.
"Take
me
there
at
once!"
Langdon's
eyes
had
not
left
the
computer
screen
since
the
search
began.
Five
minutes.
Only
two
hits.
Both
irrelevant.
He
was
starting
to
get
worried.
Pamela
Gettum
was
in
the
adjoining
room,
preparing
hot
drinks.
Langdon
and
Sophie
had
inquired
unwisely
if
there
might
be
some
coffee
brewing
alongside
the
tea
Gettum
had
offered,
and
from
the
sound
of
the
microwave
beeps
in
the
next
room,
Langdon
suspected
their
request
was
about
to
be
rewarded
with
instant
Nescafe.
Finally,
the
computer
pinged
happily.
"Sounds
like
you
got
another,"
Gettum
called
from
the
next
room.
"What's
the
title?"
Langdon
eyed
the
screen.
Grail
Allegory
