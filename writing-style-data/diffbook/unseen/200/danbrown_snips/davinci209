A
laser
tooled
varying
matrix.
Impossible
to
duplicate.
Rather
than
teeth
that
moved
tumblers,
this
key's
complex
series
of
laser
burned
pockmarks
was
examined
by
an
electric
eye.
If
the
eye
determined
that
the
hexagonal
pockmarks
were
correctly
spaced,
arranged,
and
rotated,
then
the
lock
would
open.
Sophie
could
not
begin
to
imagine
what
a
key
like
this
opened,
but
she
sensed
Robert
would
be
able
to
tell
her.
After
all,
he
had
described
the
key's
embossed
seal
without
ever
seeing
it.
The
cruciform
on
top
implied
the
key
belonged
to
some
kind
of
Christian
organization,
and
yet
Sophie
knew
of
no
churches
that
used
laser
tooled
varying
matrix
keys.
Besides,
my
grandfather
was
no
Christian.
Sophie
had
witnessed
proof
of
that
ten
years
ago.
Ironically,
it
had
been
another
key
a
far
more
normal
one
that
had
revealed
his
true
nature
to
her.
The
afternoon
had
been
warm
when
she
landed
at
Charles
de
Gaulle
Airport
and
hailed
a
taxi
home.
Grand
pere
will
be
so
surprised
to
see
me,
she
thought.
Returning
from
graduate
school
in
Britain
for
spring
break
a
few
days
early,
Sophie
couldn't
wait
to
see
him
and
tell
him
all
about
the
encryption
methods
