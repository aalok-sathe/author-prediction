the
parquet
floor.
At
first
Langdon
saw
nothing.
Then,
as
he
knelt
beside
her,
he
saw
a
tiny
droplet
of
dried
liquid
that
was
luminescing.
Ink?
Suddenly
he
recalled
what
black
lights
were
actually
used
for.
Blood.
His
senses
tingled.
Sophie
was
right.
Jacques
Sauniere
had
indeed
paid
a
visit
to
the
Mona
Lisa
before
he
died.
"He
wouldn't
have
come
here
without
a
reason,"
Sophie
whispered,
standing
up.
"I
know
he
left
a
message
for
me
here."
Quickly
striding
the
final
few
steps
to
the
Mona
Lisa,
she
illuminated
the
floor
directly
in
front
of
the
painting.
She
waved
the
light
back
and
forth
across
the
bare
parquet.
"There's
nothing
here!"
At
that
moment,
Langdon
saw
a
faint
purple
glimmer
on
the
protective
glass
before
the
Mona
Lisa.
Reaching
down,
he
took
Sophie's
wrist
and
slowly
moved
the
light
up
to
the
painting
itself.
They
both
froze.
On
the
glass,
six
words
glowed
in
purple,
scrawled
directly
across
the
Mona
Lisa's
face.
Seated
at
Sauniere's
desk,
Lieutenant
Collet
pressed
the
phone
to
his
ear
in
disbelief.
Did
I
hear
Fache
correctly?
"A
bar
of
soap?
But
how
could
Langdon
have
known
about
the
GPS
dot?"
"Sophie
Neveu,"
Fache
replied.
