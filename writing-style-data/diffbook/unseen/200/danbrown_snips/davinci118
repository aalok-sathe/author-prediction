guilty.
You
need
to
tell
Fache
that
the
message
on
the
floor
was
for
you,
and
that
my
name
is
not
there
as
an
accusation.
"I
will
do
that,"
Sophie
said,
speaking
hurriedly,
"but
after
you're
safely
inside
the
U.S.
Embassy.
It's
only
about
a
mile
from
here,
and
my
car
is
parked
just
outside
the
museum.
Dealing
with
Fache
from
here
is
too

Fache
has

to
ask
you
one
last
question."
And
your
entire
future
may
depend
on
it.
"The
writing
on
the
floor
is
obviously
not
proof
of
your
guilt,
and
yet
Fache
told
our
team
he
is
certain
you
are
his
man.
Can
you
think
of
any
other
reason
he
might
be
convinced
you're
guilty?"
Langdon
was
silent
for
several
seconds.
"None
whatsoever."
Sophie
sighed.
