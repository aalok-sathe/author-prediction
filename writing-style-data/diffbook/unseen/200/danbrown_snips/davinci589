recalled
photos
of
the
famous
tomb
and,
in
particular,
its
most
distinguishing
feature.
A
magnificent
orb.
The
huge
sphere
mounted
atop
the
tomb
was
almost
as
large
as
the
tomb
itself.
The
presence
of
the
orb
seemed
both
encouraging
and
troubling
to
the
Teacher.
On
one
hand,
it
felt
like
a
signpost,
and
yet,
according
to
the
poem,
the
missing
piece
of
the
puzzle
was
an
orb
that
ought
to
be
on
his
tomb
not
one
that
was
already
there.
He
was
counting
on
his
closer
inspection
of
the
tomb
to
unveil
the
answer.
The
rain
was
getting
heavier
now,
and
he
tucked
the
cryptex
deep
in
his
right
hand
pocket
to
protect
it
from
the
dampness.
He
kept
the
tiny
Medusa
revolver
in
his
left,
out
of
sight.
Within
minutes,
he
was
stepping
into
the
quiet
sanctuary
of
London's
grandest
nine
hundred
year
old
building.
Just
as
the
Teacher
was
stepping
out
of
the
rain,
Bishop
Aringarosa
was
stepping
into
it.
On
the
rainy
tarmac
at
Biggin
Hill
Executive
Airport,
Aringarosa
emerged
from
his
cramped
plane,
bundling
his
cassock
against
the
cold
damp.
He
had
hoped
to
be
greeted
by
Captain
Fache.
Instead
a
young
British
police
officer
approached
