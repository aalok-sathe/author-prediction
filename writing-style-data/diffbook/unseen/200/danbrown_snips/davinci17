could
now
see
the
end
of
the

Despite
the
orgiastic
rituals
once
held
at
the
Arc
du
Carrousel,
art
aficionados
revered
this
place
for
another
reason
entirely.
From
the
esplanade
at
the
end
of
the
Tuileries,
four
of
the
finest
art
museums
in
the
world
could
be
seen

Langdon
could

dramatically

facade

esteemed
Musee

Glancing

But
it
was
straight

through

that
Langdon
could

see
the
monolithic

palace
that
had
become
the
most
famous
art

in
the
world.
