the

day.
Collet's
gaze
moved
now
to
a
shelf
on
which
were
stacked
several
hundred
audio
cassettes,
all
labeled
with
dates
and
numbers.
Someone
has
been
very
busy.
He
turned
back
to
the
agent.
"Do
you
have
any
idea
what

is
being
bugged?"
"Well,

did.
Throughout

held
knowledge

always
been
magnets
for
thieves
and
scholars
alike.
The
fact
that
Teabing
had
been
a
