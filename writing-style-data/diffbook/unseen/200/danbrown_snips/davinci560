a
pay
phone
to
call
the
police,
despite
Remy's
warning
to
the
contrary.
Langdon
sat
on
a
grungy
bench
nearby,
feeling
remorseful.
"The
best
way
to
help
Leigh,"
Sophie
reiterated
as
she
dialed,
"is
to
involve
the
London
authorities
immediately.
Trust
me."
Langdon
had
not
initially
agreed
with
this
idea,
but
as
they
had
hatched
their
plan,
Sophie's
logic
began
to
make
sense.
Teabing
was
safe
at
the
moment.
Even
if
Remy
and
the
others
knew
where
the
knight's
tomb
was
located,
they
still
might
need
Teabing's
help
deciphering
the
orb
reference.
What
worried
Langdon
was
what
would
happen
after
the
Grail
map
had
been
found.
Leigh
will
become
a
huge
liability.
If
Langdon
were
to
have
any
chance
of
helping
Leigh,
or
of
ever
seeing
the
keystone
again,
it
was
essential
that
he
find
the
tomb
first.
Unfortunately,
Remy
has
a
big
head
start.
Slowing
Remy
down
had
become
Sophie's
task.
Finding
the
right
tomb
had
become
Langdon's.
Sophie
would
make
Remy
and
Silas
fugitives
of
the
London
police,
forcing
them
into
hiding
or,
better
yet,
catching
them.
Langdon's
plan
was
less
certain
to
take
the
tube
to
nearby
King's
College,
which
was
renowned
for
its
electronic
theological
database.
