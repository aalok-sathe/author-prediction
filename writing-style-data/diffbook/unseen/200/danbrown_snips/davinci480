of
the
house,
and
drove
trembling
back
to
Paris.
The
chartered
turboprop
was
just
passing
over
the
twinkling
lights
of
Monaco
when
Aringarosa
hung
up
on
Fache
for
the
second
time.
He
reached
for
the
airsickness
bag
again
but
felt
too
drained
even
to
be
sick.
Just
let
it
be
over!
Fache's
newest
update
seemed
unfathomable,
and
yet
almost
nothing
tonight
made
sense
anymore.
What
is
going
on
?
Everything
had
spiraled
wildly
out
of
control.
What
have
I
gotten
Silas
into
?
What
have
I
gotten
myself
into!
On
shaky
legs,
Aringarosa
walked
to
the
cockpit.
"I
need
to
change
destinations."
The
pilot
glanced
over
his
shoulder
and
laughed.
"You're
joking,
right?"
"No.
I
have
to
get
to
London
immediately."
"Father,
this
is
a
charter
flight,
not
a
taxi."
"I
will
pay
you
extra,
of
course.
How
much?
London
is
only
one
hour
farther
north
and
requires
almost
no
change
of
direction,
so
"It's
not
a
question
of
money,
Father,
there
are
other
issues."
"Ten
thousand
euro.
Right
now."
The
pilot
turned,
his
eyes
wide
with
shock.
"How
much?
What
kind
of
priest
carries
that
kind
of
cash?"
Aringarosa
walked
back
to
his
black
briefcase,
opened
it,
and
removed
