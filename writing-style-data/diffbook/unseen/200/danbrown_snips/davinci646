he
will
kill
us
both.
Even
without
looking
at
Sophie,
he
could
hear
her
heart
beseeching
him
in
silent
desperation.
Robert,
this
man
is
not
worthy
of
the
Grail.
Please
do
not
place
it
in
his
hands.
No
matter
what
the
cost.
Langdon
had
already
made
his
decision
several
minutes
ago,
while
standing
alone
at
the
window
overlooking
College
Garden.
Protect
Sophie.
Protect
the
Grail.
Langdon
had
almost
shouted
out
in
desperation.
But
I
cannot
see
how!
The
stark
moments
of
disillusionment
had
brought
with
them
a
clarity
unlike
any
he
had
ever
felt.
The
Truth
is
right
before
your
eyes,
Robert.
He
knew
not
from
where
the
epiphany
came.
The
Grail
is
not
mocking
you,
she
is
calling
out
to
a
worthy
soul.
Now,
bowing
down
like
a
subject
several
yards
in
front
of
Leigh
Teabing,
Langdon
lowered
the
cryptex
to
within
inches
of
the
stone
floor.
"Yes,
Robert,"
Teabing
whispered,
aiming
the
gun
at
him.
"Set
it
down."
Langdon's
eyes
moved
heavenward,
up
into
the
gaping
void
of
the
Chapter
House
cupola.
Crouching
lower,
Langdon
lowered
his
gaze
to
Teabing's
gun,
aimed
directly
at
him.
"I'm
sorry,
Leigh."
In
one
fluid
motion,
Langdon
leapt
up,
swinging
his
arm
