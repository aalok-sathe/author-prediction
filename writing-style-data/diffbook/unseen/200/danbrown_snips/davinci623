feeling
that
gunshots
in
this
secluded,
thick
walled
chamber
would
go
unheard,
especially
in
this
rain.
And
Leigh
just
admitted
his
guilt
to
us.
Langdon
glanced
at
Sophie,
who
looked
shaken.
The
Church
murdered
Sophie
's
family
to
silence
the
Priory?
Langdon
felt
certain
the
modern
Church
did
not
murder
people.
There
had
to
be
some
other
explanation.
"Let
Sophie
leave,"
Langdon
declared,
staring
at
Leigh.
"You
and
I
should
discuss
this
alone."
Teabing
gave
an
unnatural
laugh.
"I'm
afraid
that
is
one
show
of
faith
I
cannot
afford.
I
can,
however,
offer
you
this.
"
He
propped
himself
fully
on
his
crutches,
gracelessly
keeping
the
gun
aimed
at
Sophie,
and
removed
the
keystone
from
his
pocket.
He
swayed
a
bit
as
he
held
it
out
for
Langdon.
"A
token
of
trust,
Robert."
Robert
felt
wary
and
didn't
move.
Leigh
is
giving
the
keystone
back
to
us?
"Take
it,"
Teabing
said,
thrusting
it
awkwardly
toward
Langdon.
Langdon
could
imagine
only
one
reason
Teabing
would
give
it
back.
"You
opened
it
already.
You
removed
the
map."
Teabing
was
shaking
his
head.
"Robert,
if
I
had
solved
the
keystone,
I
would
have
disappeared
to
find
the
Grail
myself
and
kept
you
uninvolved.
