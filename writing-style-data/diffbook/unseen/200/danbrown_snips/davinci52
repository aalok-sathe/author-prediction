Church,
sir.
Symbols
are
very
resilient,
but
the
pentacle
was
altered
by
the
early
Roman
Catholic
Church.
As
part
of
the
Vatican's
campaign
to
eradicate
pagan
religions
and
convert
the
masses
to
Christianity,
the
Church
launched
a
smear
campaign
against
the
pagan
gods
and
goddesses,
recasting
their
divine
symbols
as
evil.
"Goon."
"This
is
very
common
in
times
of
turmoil,"
Langdon
continued.
"A
newly
emerging
power
will
take
over
the
existing
symbols
and
degrade
them
over
time
in
an
attempt
to
erase
their
meaning.
In
the
battle
between
the
pagan
symbols
and
Christian
symbols,
the
pagans
lost;
Poseidon's
trident
became
the
devil's
pitchfork,
the
wise
crone's
pointed
hat
became
the
symbol
of
a
witch,
and
Venus's
pentacle
became
a
sign
of
the
devil."
Langdon
paused.
"Unfortunately,
the
United
States
military
has
also
perverted
the
pentacle;
it's
now
our
foremost
symbol
of
war.
We
paint
it
on
all
our
fighter
jets
and
hang
it
on
the
shoulders
of
all
our
generals."
So
much
for
the
goddess
of
love
and
beauty.
"Interesting."
Fache
nodded
toward
the
spread
eagle
corpse.
"And
the
positioning
of
the
body?
What
do
you
make
of
that?"
Langdon
shrugged.
"The
position
simply
reinforces
the
reference
to
the
pentacle
