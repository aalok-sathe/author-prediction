finding

was
worth
her
life.
As
the
armored
truck
accelerated
again,
Langdon
was
pleased
how
much
more
smoothly
it
drove.
"Do
you
know
how
to
get
to
Versailles?"
Sophie
eyed
him.
"Sightseeing?"
"No,
I
have
a
plan.
There's
a
religious
historian
I
know
who
lives
near
Versailles.
I
can't
remember
exactly
where,
but
we
can
look
it
up.
I've
been
to
his
estate
a
few
times.
His
name
is
Leigh
Teabing.
He's
a

Royal
Historian."
"And

is
the

He's
written

do
with
it."
Sophie's
eyes
were
wary.
"Can
you
trust
him?"
"Trust
him
to
what?
Not
steal
the
information?"
"And
not
to
turn
us
in."
"I
don't
intend
to
tell
him
we're
wanted
by
the
police.
I'm
hoping
he'll
take
us
in
until
we
can
sort
all
this
out."
"Robert,

it
