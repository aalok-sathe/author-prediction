grandfather
asleep
at
this
hour
and
was
excited
to
see
the
house
twinkling
with
lights.
Her
delight
turned
to
surprise,
however,
when
she
arrived
to
find
the
driveway
filled
with
parked
cars
Mercedeses,
BMWs,
Audis,
and
a
Rolls
Royce.
Sophie
stared
a
moment
and
then
burst
out
laughing.
My
grand
pere,
the
famous
recluse!
Jacques
Sauniere,
it
seemed,
was
far
less
reclusive
than
he
liked
to
pretend.
Clearly
he
was
hosting
a
party
while
Sophie
was
away
at
school,
and
from
the
looks
of
the
automobiles,
some
of
Paris's
most
influential
people
were
in
attendance.
Eager
to
surprise
him,
she
hurried
to
the
front
door.
When
she
got
there,
though,
she
found
it
locked.
She
knocked.
Nobody
answered.
Puzzled,
she
walked
around
and
tried
the
back
door.
It
too
was
locked.
No
answer.
Confused,
she
stood
a
moment
and
listened.
The
only
sound
she
heard
was
the
cool
Normandy
air
letting
out
a
low
moan
as
it
swirled
through
the
valley.
No
music.
No
voices.
Nothing.
In
the
silence
of
the
woods,
Sophie
hurried
to
the
side
of
the
house
and
clambered
up
on
a
woodpile,
pressing
her
face
to
the
living
room
window.
What
she
saw
inside
made
no
