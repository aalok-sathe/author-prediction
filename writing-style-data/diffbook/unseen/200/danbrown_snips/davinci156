Embedded
in
the
gray
granite
floor,
a
thin
polished
strip
of
brass
glistened
in
the
stone
a
golden
line
slanting
across
the
church's
floor.
The
line
bore
graduated
markings,
like
a
ruler.
It
was
a
gnomon,
Silas
had
been
told,
a
pagan
astronomical
device
like
a
sundial.
Tourists,
scientists,
historians,
and
pagans
from
around
the
world
came
to
Saint
Sulpice
to
gaze
upon
this
famous
line.
The
Rose
Line.
Slowly,
Silas
let
his
eyes
trace
the
path
of
the
brass
strip
as
it
made
its
way
across
the
floor
from
his
right
to
left,
slanting
in
front
of
him
at
an
awkward
angle,
entirely
at
odds
with
the
symmetry
of
the
church.
Slicing
across
the
main
altar
itself,
the
line
looked
to
Silas
like
a
slash
wound
across
a
beautiful
face.
The
strip
cleaved
the
communion
rail
in
two
and
then
crossed
the
entire
width
of
the
church,
finally
reaching
the
corner
of
the
north
transept,
where
it
arrived
at
the
base
of
a
most
unexpected
structure.
A
colossal
Egyptian
obelisk.
Here,
the
glistening
Rose
Line
took
a
ninety
degree
vertical
turn
and
continued
directly
up
the
face
of
the
obelisk
itself,
ascending
thirty
three
feet
to
the
very
tip
