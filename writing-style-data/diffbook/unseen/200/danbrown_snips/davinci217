seemed
to
have
lost
the
police,
at
least
for
the
moment,
Langdon
doubted
their
luck
would
hold
for
long.
Behind
the
wheel
Sophie
was
fishing
in
her
sweater
pocket.
She
removed
a
small
metal
object
and
held
it
out
for
him.
"Robert,
you'd
better
have
a
look
at
this.
This
is
what
my
grandfather
left
me
behind
Madonna
of
the
Rocks.
Feeling
a
shiver
of
anticipation,
Langdon
took
the
object
and
examined
it.
It
was
heavy
and
shaped
like
a
cruciform.
His
first
instinct
was
that
he
was
holding
a
funeral
pieu
a
miniature
version
of
a
memorial
spike
designed
to
be
stuck
into
the
ground
at
a
gravesite.
But
then
he
noted
the
shaft
protruding
from
the
cruciform
was
prismatic
and
triangular.
The
shaft
was
also
pockmarked
with
hundreds
of
tiny
hexagons
that
appeared
to
be
finely
tooled
and
scattered
at
random.
"It's
a
laser
cut
key,"
Sophie
told
him.
"Those
hexagons
are
read
by
an
electric
eye."
A
key?
Langdon
had
never
seen
anything
like
it.
"Look
at
the
other
side,"
she
said,
changing
lanes
and
sailing
through
an
intersection.
When
Langdon
turned
the
key,
he
felt
his
jaw
drop.
There,
intricately
embossed
on
the
center
of
the
