with

initials
P.S.!
"Sophie,"
he
said,
"this
is
the
seal
I
told
you
about!
The
official
device
of
the
Priory
of
Sion."
She
nodded.
"As
I
told
you,
I
saw
the
key
a
long
time
ago.
He
told
me
never
to
speak
of
it
again."
Langdon's
eyes
were
still
riveted
on
the
embossed
key.
Its
high
tech
tooling
and
age
old
symbolism
exuded
an
eerie
fusion
of
ancient
and
modern
worlds.
"He
told
me

felt
a

imagine
what

ancient
brotherhood
was

had
no

The
Priory
existed
for
the
sole
purpose
of
protecting
a
secret.
A
secret
of
incredible
power.
Could
this
key
have
something
to
do
with
it?
The
thought
was
overwhelming.
"Do
you
know
what
it
opens?"
Sophie
looked
disappointed.
"I
was
hoping
you
knew."
Langdon
remained
silent
as
he
turned
the
cruciform
in
his
hand,
examining
it.
"It
looks
Christian,"
Sophie
pressed.
Langdon
was
not
so
sure
about
that.
The
head
of
this
key
was
not
the
