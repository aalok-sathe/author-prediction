Langdon
unveiled

in
the
architectural
dimensions
of
the
Greek
Parthenon,
the
pyramids
of
Egypt,
and
even
the
United
Nations
Building
in
New
York.
PHI
appeared
in
the
organizational
structures
of
Mozart's
sonatas,
Beethoven's
Fifth
Symphony,
as
well
as
the
works
of
Bartok,
Debussy,
and
Schubert.
The
number
PHI,
Langdon
told
them,
was
even
used
by
Stradivarius
to
calculate
the
exact
placement
of
the
f
holes
in
the
construction
of
his
famous
violins.
"In
closing,"
Langdon
said,
walking
to
the
chalkboard,
"we
return
to
symbols"
He
drew
five
intersecting
lines
that
formed
a
five
pointed
star.
"This
symbol
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
images
you
will
see
this
term.
Formally
known
as
a
pentagram
or
pentacle,
as
the
ancients
called
it
this
symbol
is
considered
both
divine
and
magical
by
many
cultures.
Can
anyone
tell
me
why
that
might
be?"
Stettner,
the
math
major,
raised
his
hand.
"Because
if
you
draw
a
pentagram,
the
lines
automatically
divide
themselves
into
segments
according
to
the
Divine
Proportion."
Langdon
gave
the
kid
a
proud
nod.
"Nice
job.
Yes,
the

of
