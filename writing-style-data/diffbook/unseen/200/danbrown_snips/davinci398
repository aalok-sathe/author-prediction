wished
her
grandfather
had
never
mentioned
her
family
this
afternoon.
He
had
torn
open
old
wounds
that
felt
as
painful
now
as
ever.
They
are
dead,
Sophie.
They
are
not
coming
back.
She
thought
of
her
mother
singing
her
to
sleep
at
night,
of
her
father
giving
her
rides
on
his
shoulders,
and

around
us,
but
tonight
is
the
first
time
I've
ever

any
of
this."
Langdon
looked
as
if
he
wanted
to
put
a
comforting
hand
on
her
shoulder,
but
he
refrained.
"You've
heard
her
story
before,
Sophie.
Everyone
has.
We
just
don't
realize
it
when
we
hear
it."
"I
don't
understand."
"The
Grail
story
is
everywhere,
