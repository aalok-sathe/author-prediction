trove
of
documents,
which
had
apparently
been
their
source
of
power,
was
Clement's
true
objective,
but
it
slipped
through
his
fingers.
The
documents
had
long
since
been
entrusted
to
the
Templars'
shadowy
architects,
the
Priory
of
Sion,
whose
veil
of
secrecy
had
kept
them
safely
out
of
range
of
the
Vatican's
onslaught.
As
the
Vatican
closed
in,
the
Priory
smuggled
their
documents
from
a
Paris
preceptory
by
night
onto
Templar
ships
in
La
Rochelle."
"Where
did
the
documents
go?"
Langdon
shrugged.
"That
mystery's
answer
is
known
only
to
the
Priory
of
Sion.
Because
the
documents
remain
the
source
of
constant
investigation
and
speculation
even
today,
they
are
believed
to
have
been
moved
and
rehidden
several
times.
Current
speculation
places
the
documents
somewhere
in
the
United
Kingdom."
Sophie
looked
uneasy.
"For
a
thousand
years,"
Langdon
continued,
"legends
of
this
secret
have
been
passed
on.
The
entire
collection
of
documents,
its
power,
and
the
secret
it
reveals
have
become
known
by
a
single
name
Sangreal.
Hundreds
of
books
have
been
written
about
it,
and
few
mysteries
have
caused
as
much
interest
among
historians
as
the
Sangreal."
"The
Sangreal?
Does
the
word
have
anything
to
do
with
the
French
word
sang
