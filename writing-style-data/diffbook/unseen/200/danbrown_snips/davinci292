Vernet
said,
walking
into
the
waiting
room.
"Getting
you
out
will
be
difficult."
As
he
closed
the
door
behind
him,
Vernet
saw
the
heavy
duty
plastic
case
on
the
conveyor
belt
and
halted
in
his
tracks.
My
God!
They
accessed
Sauniere's
account?
Sophie
and
Langdon
were
at
the
table,
huddling
over
what
looked

be
a
large
wooden
jewelry
box.
Sophie

"We

Vernet
