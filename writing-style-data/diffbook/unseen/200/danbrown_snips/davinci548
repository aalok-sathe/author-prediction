You
want
to
find
the
Grail
as
much
as
I
do."
You're
wrong.
You
want
it
much
more.
You've
proven
you're
willing
to
kill
for
it."
Forty
feet
away,
peering
out
from
the
annex
pews
near
the
archway,
Remy
Legaludec
felt
a
rising
alarm.
The
maneuver
had
not
gone
as
planned,
and
even
from
here,
he
could
see
Silas
was
uncertain
how
to
handle
the
situation.
At
the
Teacher's
orders,
Remy
had
forbidden
Silas
to
fire
his

"Let

go,"
Langdon
again
demanded,
holding
the
cryptex

Silas's
gun.

and
Remy
tightened

fear
that
Silas
might
actually
shoot
Langdon

he
was
holding
the
cryptex.
The
cryptex
cannot
fall!
The
cryptex
was
to
be
Remy's
ticket
to
freedom
and
wealth.
A
little
over
a
year
ago,
he
was
simply
a
fifty
five
year
old
manservant
living
within
the
walls
of
Chateau
Villette,
catering
to
the
whims
of
the
insufferable
cripple
Sir
Leigh
Teabing.
Then
he
was
approached
with
an
extraordinary
proposition.
Remy's
association
with
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
the
preeminent
Grail
historian
on
earth
was
going
to
bring
Remy
everything
he
had
ever
dreamed
