tentatively
titled
Symbols
of
the
Lost
Sacred
Feminine
proposed
some
very
unconventional
interpretations
of
established
religious
iconography
which
would
certainly
be
controversial.
Now,
as
Langdon
approached
the
stationary
escalators,
he
paused,
realizing
Fache
was
no
longer
beside
him.
Turning,
Langdon
saw
Fache
standing
several
yards
back
at
a
service
elevator.
"We'll
take

Fache
said
as
the

Langdon
had
fallen
down
an
abandoned
well
shaft
and
almost
died
treading
water
in
the
narrow
space
for
hours
before
being
rescued.
Since
then,
he'd
suffered
a
haunting
phobia
of
enclosed
spaces
elevators,
subways,
squash
courts.
The
elevator
is
a
perfectly
safe
machine,
Langdon
continually
told
himself,
never
believing
it.
It's
a
tiny
metal
box
hanging
in
an
enclosed
shaft!
Holding
his
breath,
he
