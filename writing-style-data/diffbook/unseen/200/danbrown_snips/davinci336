than
my
grandfather?"
"I
meant
more
than
anyone
outside
the
brotherhood."
"How
do
you
know
Teabing
isn't
a
member
of
the
brotherhood?"
"Teabing
has
spent
his
life
trying
to
broadcast
the
truth
about
the
Holy
Grail.
The
Priory's
oath
is
to
keep
its
true
nature
hidden.
"Sounds
to
me
like
a
conflict
of
interest."
Langdon
understood
her
concerns.
Sauniere
had
given
the
cryptex
directly
to
Sophie,
and

him
about
the
Grail,
you'll
start
to
have
an
idea
why
your
grandfather
gave
this
to
you.
"Us,
"
Sophie
reminded.
Langdon
felt
a
humble
pride
and
wondered
yet
again
why
Sauniere
had
included
him.
"Do
you
know
more
or
less
where
Mr.
Teabing
lives?"
Sophie
asked.
"His
estate
is
called
Chateau
Villette."
Sophie
turned

an
incredulous
look.
"The
Chateau
Villette?"
"That's
the
one."
"Nice
