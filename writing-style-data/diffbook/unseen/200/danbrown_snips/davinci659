is
engraved
with
a
mind
boggling
array
of
symbols
from
the
Jewish,
Christian,
Egyptian,
Masonic,
and
pagan
traditions.
The
chapel's
geographic
coordinates
fall
precisely
on
the
north
south
meridian
that
runs
through
Glastonbury.
This
longitudinal
Rose
Line
is
the
traditional
marker
of
King
Arthur's
Isle
of
Avalon
and
is
considered
the
central
pillar
of
Britain's
sacred
geometry.
It
is
from
this
hallowed
Rose
Line
that
Rosslyn
originally
spelled
Roslin
takes
its
name.
Rosslyn's
rugged
spires
were
casting
long
evening
shadows
as
Robert
Langdon
and
Sophie
Neveu
pulled
their
rental
car
into
the
grassy
parking
area
at
the
foot
of
the
bluff
on
which
the
chapel
stood.
Their
short
flight
from
London
to
Edinburgh
had
been
restful,
although
neither
of
them
had
slept
for
the
anticipation
of
what
lay
ahead.
Gazing
up
at
the
stark
edifice
framed
against
a
cloud
swept
sky,
Langdon
felt
like
Alice
falling
headlong
into
the
rabbit
hole.
This
must
be
a
dream.
And
yet
he
knew
the
text
of
Sauniere's
final
message
could
not
have
been
more
specific.
The
Holy
Grail
'neath
ancient
Roslin
waits.
Langdon
had
fantasized
that
Sauniere's
"Grail
map"
would
be
a
diagram
a
drawing
with
an
X
marks
the
spot
and
yet
