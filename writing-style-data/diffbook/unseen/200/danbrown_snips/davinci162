it
in
the
pocket
of
her
sweater
and
hurried
back
up
the
hallway
toward
the
open
doors
of
the
Salle
des
Etats.
Sophie
turned
the
corner
and
stepped
over
the
threshold.
Her
entrance,
however,
was
met
by
an
unexpected
sound
of
muffled
footsteps
racing
toward
her
from
inside
the
chamber.
There
's
someone
in
here!
A
ghostly
figure
emerged
suddenly
from
out
of
the
reddish

"There

are!"
Langdon's
hoarse
whisper
cut
the
air
as
his
silhouette

Langdon

breath
as
his
blue
eyes
held
her
firmly.
"The
letters
P.S.
do
they
mean
anything
else
to
you?
Anything
at
all?"
Afraid
their
voices
might
echo
down
the
hall,
Sophie
pulled
him
into
the
Salle
des
Etats
and
closed
the
enormous
twin
doors
silently,
sealing
them
inside.
"I
told
you,
the
initials
mean
Princess
Sophie."
"I
know,
but
did
you
ever
see
them
anywhere
else?
Did
