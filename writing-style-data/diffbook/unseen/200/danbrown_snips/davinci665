looking
uncertain.
"My
grandfather
must
have
brought
me
here
when
I
was
very
young.
I
don't
know.
It
feels
familiar."
As
her
eyes
scanned
the
room,
she
began
nodding
with
more
certainty.
"Yes."
She
pointed
to
the
front
of
the
sanctuary.
"Those
two
pillars
I've
seen
them."
Langdon
looked
at
the
pair
of
intricately
sculpted
columns
at
the
far
end
of
the
sanctuary.
Their
white
lacework
carvings
seemed
to
smolder
with
a
ruddy
glow
as
the
last
of
the
day's
sunlight
streamed
in
through
the
west
window.
The
pillars
positioned
where
the
altar
would
normally
stand
were
an
oddly
matched
pair.
The
pillar
on
the
left
was
carved
with
simple,
vertical
lines,
while
the
pillar
on
the
right
was
embellished
with
an
ornate,
flowering
spiral.
Sophie
was
already
moving
toward
them.
Langdon
hurried
after
her,
and
as
they
reached
the
pillars,
Sophie
was
nodding
with
incredulity.
"Yes,
I'm
positive
I
have
seen
these!"
"I
don't
doubt
you've
seen
them,"
Langdon
said,
"but
it
wasn't
necessarily
here.
She
turned.
"What
do
you
mean?"
"These
two
pillars
are
the
most
duplicated
architectural
structures
in
history.
Replicas
exist
all
over
the
world."
"Replicas
of
Rosslyn?"
She
looked
skeptical.
"No.
Of
the
pillars.
