gone
out
on
a
limb
tonight
to
arrest
Robert
Langdon
surveillance
cachee,
Interpol,
and
now
television.
Not
even
the
great
Bezu
Fache
would
survive
the
political
fallout
if
he
had
mistakenly
splashed
a
prominent
American's
face
all
over
French
television,
claiming
he
was
a
murderer.
If
Fache
now
realized
he'd
made
a
mistake,
then
it
made
perfect
sense
that
he
would
tell
Collet
not
to
make
a
move.
The
last
thing
Fache
needed
was
for
Collet
to
storm
an
innocent
Brit's
private
estate
and
take
Langdon
at
gunpoint.
Moreover,
Collet
realized,
if
Langdon
were
innocent,
it
explained
one
of
this
case's
strangest
paradoxes:
Why
had
Sophie
Neveu,
the
granddaughter
of
the
victim,
helped
the
alleged
killer
escape?
Unless
Sophie
knew
Langdon
was
falsely
charged.
Fache
had
posited
all
kinds
of
explanations
tonight
to
explain
Sophie's
odd
behavior,
including
that
Sophie,
as
Sauniere's
sole
heir,
had
persuaded
her
secret
lover
Robert
Langdon
to
kill
off
Sauniere
for
the
inheritance
money.
Sauniere,
if
he
had
suspected
this,
might
have
left
the
police
the
message
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Collet
was
fairly
certain
something
else
was
going
on
here.
Sophie
Neveu
seemed
far
too
solid
of
character
to
be
mixed
up
in
something
