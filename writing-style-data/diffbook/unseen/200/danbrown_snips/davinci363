that
both
the
Bible
and
our
standard
Grail
legend
celebrate
this
moment
as
the
definitive
arrival
of
the
Holy
Grail.
Oddly,
Da
Vinci
appears
to
have
forgotten
to
paint
the
Cup
of
Christ.
"Surely
art
scholars
must
have
noted
that."
"You
will
be
shocked
to
learn
what
anomalies
Da
Vinci
included
here
that
most
scholars
either
do
not
see
or
simply
choose
to
ignore.
This
fresco,
in
fact,
is
the
entire
key
to
the
Holy
Grail
mystery.
Da
Vinci
lays
it
all

the
open
in
The
Last
Supper"
Sophie
scanned
the
work
eagerly.
"Does
this
fresco
tell
us
what
the
Grail
really

"Not

it
is,"
Teabing
whispered.
"But
rather
who
it
is.
The
Holy
Grail
is
not
a
thing.
It
is,
in
fact
a.
person"
Sophie
stared
at
Teabing
a
long
moment
and
then
turned
to
Langdon.
"The
Holy
Grail
is
a
person?"
Langdon
nodded.
"A
woman,
in
fact."
From
the
blank
look
on
Sophie's
face,
Langdon
could
tell
they
had
already
lost
her.
He
recalled
having
a
similar
reaction
the
first
time
he
heard
the
statement.
It
was
not
until
he
understood
the
symbology
behind
the
Grail
that
the
feminine
connection
became
clear.
Teabing
