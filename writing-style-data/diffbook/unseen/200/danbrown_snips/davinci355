Christianity!
The
Bible,
as
we
know
it
today,
was
collated
by
the
pagan
Roman
emperor
Constantine
the
Great."
"I
thought
Constantine
was
a
Christian,"
Sophie
said.
"Hardly,"
Teabing
scoffed.
"He
was
a
lifelong
pagan
who
was
baptized
on
his
deathbed,
too
weak
to
protest.
In
Constantine's
day,
Rome's
official
religion
was

worship
the
cult

the
sun
worshipping
pagans
to
Christianity.
By
fusing
pagan
