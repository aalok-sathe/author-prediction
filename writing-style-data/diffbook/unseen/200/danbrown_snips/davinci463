began
examining
the
underside
of
the
lid.
Her
grandfather
couldn't
actually
write
in
reverse,
so
he
always
cheated
by
writing
normally
and
then
flipping
the
paper
over
and
tracing
the
reversed
impression.
Sophie's
guess
was
that
he
had
wood
burned
normal
text
into
a
block
of
wood
and
then
run
the
back
of
the
block
through
a
sander
until
the
wood
was
paper
thin
and
the
wood
burning
could
be
seen
through
the
wood.
Then
he'd
simply
flipped
the
piece
over,
and
laid
it
in.
As
Sophie
moved
the
lid
closer
to
the
light,
she
saw
she
was
right.
The
bright
beam
sifted
through
the
thin
layer
of
wood,
and
the
script
appeared
in
reverse
on
the
underside
of
the
lid.
Instantly
legible.
"English,"
Teabing
croaked,
hanging
his
head
in
shame.
"My
native
tongue."
At
the
rear
of
the
plane,
Remy
Legaludec
strained
to
hear
beyond
the
rumbling
engines,
but
the
conversation
up
front
was
inaudible.
Remy
did
not
like
the
way
the
night
was
progressing.
Not
at
all.
He
looked
down
at
the
bound
monk
at
his
feet.
The
man
lay
perfectly
still
now,
as
if
in
a
trance
of
acceptance,
or
perhaps,
in
silent
prayer
for
deliverance.
