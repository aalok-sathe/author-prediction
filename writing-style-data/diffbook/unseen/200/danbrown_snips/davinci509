with

"I'll
bring
the
car."
Remy
started
down
the
stairs.
"I'm
afraid
we
cannot
let
you
leave,"
the
chief
inspector
said.
"Please
return
to
your
aircraft.
Both
of
you.
Representatives
from
the
French
police
will
be
landing
shortly."
Teabing
looked
now
toward
Simon
Edwards.
"Simon,

on

Just
the

Remy,

Biggin
Hill.
"I
will
look
myself."
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"No
you
won't,
Inspector.
This
is
private
property
and
until
you
have
a
search
warrant,
you

Mr.
Edwards
can

"No
