He
almost
laughed
out
loud
at
the
absurdity
of
it.
The
Grail
was
believed
to
be
somewhere
in
England,
buried
in
a
hidden
chamber
beneath
one
of
the
many
Templar
churches,
where
it
had
been
hidden
since
at
least
1500.
The
era
of
Grand
Master
Da
Vinci.
The
Priory,
in
order
to
keep
their
powerful
documents
safe,
had
been
forced
to
move
them
many
times
in
the
early
centuries.
Historians
now
suspected
as
many
as
six
different
Grail
relocations
since
its
arrival
in
Europe
from
Jerusalem.
The
last
Grail
"sighting"
had
been
in
1447
when
numerous
eyewitnesses
described
a
fire
that
had
broken
out
and
almost
engulfed
the
documents
before
they
were
carried
to
safety
in
four
huge
chests
that
each
required
six
men
to
carry.
After
that,
nobody
claimed
to
see
the
Grail
ever
again.
All
that
remained
were
occasional
whisperings
that
it
was
hidden
in
Great
Britain,
the
land
of
King
Arthur
and
the
Knights
of
the
Round
Table.
Wherever
it
was,
two
important
facts
remained:
Leonardo
knew
where
the
Grail
resided
during
his
lifetime.
That
hiding
place
had
probably
not
changed
to
this
day.
For
this
reason,
Grail
enthusiasts
still
pored
over
Da
Vinci's
art
and
diaries
