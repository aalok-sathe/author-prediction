have
double
meanings,
and
yet
Langdon
could
see
no
further.
Marie
gave
a
tired
yawn.
"Mr.
Langdon,
I
will
make
a
confession
to
you.
I
have
never
officially
been
privy
to
the
present
location
of
the
Grail.
But,
of
course,
I
was
married
to
a
person
of
enormous
influence
and
my
women's
intuition
is
strong."
Langdon
started
to
speak
but
Marie
continued.
"I
am
sorry
that
after
all
your
hard
work,
you
will
be
leaving
Rosslyn
without

"Both

entering.
"I
was
just
leaving,"
her
grandmother
replied,
walking
over
to
Sophie
at
the
door.
"Good
night,
princess."
She
kissed
Sophie's
forehead.
"Don't
keep
Mr.
Langdon
out
too
late."
Langdon
and
Sophie
watched
her
grandmother
walk
back
toward
the
fieldstone
house.
When
Sophie
turned
to
him,
her
eyes
were
awash
in
deep
emotion.
"Not
exactly
the
ending
I
expected."
That
makes
two
of
us,
he
thought.
Langdon
could
