has
recently
passed,
and
with
it
has
ended
the
two
thousand
year
long
astrological
Age
of
Pisces
the
fish,
which
is
also
the
sign
of
Jesus.
As
any
astrological
symbologist
will
tell
you,
the
Piscean
ideal
believes
that
man
must
be
told
what
to
do
by
higher
powers
because
man
is
incapable
of
thinking
for
himself.
Hence
it
has
been
a
time
of
fervent
religion.
Now,
however,
we
are
entering
the
Age
of
Aquarius
the
water

much
interest
or

for
him,
but
he
knew
there
were
those
in
the
Church
who
followed
it
very
closely.
"The
Church
calls
this
transitional
period
the
End
of
Days."
Sophie
looked
skeptical.
"As
in
the
end
of
the
world?
The
Apocalypse?"
"No."
Langdon
replied.
"That's
a
common
misconception.
Many
religions
speak
of
the
End
of
Days.
It
refers
not
to
the
end
of
the
world,
but
rather
the
end
of
our
current
age
Pisces,
which
began
at
the
time
of
Christ's
birth,
spanned
two
thousand
years,
