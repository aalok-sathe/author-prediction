the
bottom
of
the
driveway,
Collet
heard
the
gunshot.
The
muffled
pop
sent
panic
through
his
veins.
With
Fache
on
the
way,
Collet
had
already
relinquished
any
hopes
of
claiming
personal
credit
for
finding
Langdon
tonight.
But
Collet
would
be
damned
if
Fache's
ego
landed
him
in
front
of
a
Ministerial
Review
Board
for
negligent
police
procedure.
A

was
discharged
inside

home!
And
you

Collet
knew
the
opportunity

mind,
Robert

heard
the
gunshot.
He'd
also
heard
a
scream
of
pain.
His
own?
A
jackhammer
was
boring
a
hole
into
the
back
of
his
cranium.
Somewhere
nearby,
people
were
talking.
"Where
the
devil
were
you?"
Teabing
was
yelling.
The
manservant
hurried
in.
"What
happened?
Oh
my
God!
Who
is
that?
I'll
call
the
police!"
"Bloody
hell!
Don't
call
the
police.
Make
yourself
useful
and
get
us
something
