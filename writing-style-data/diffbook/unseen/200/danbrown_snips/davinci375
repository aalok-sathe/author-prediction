bit
too
perfect
for
coincidence,
wouldn't
you
say?"
Teabing
asked.
Sophie
was
amazed.
"Why
is
it
there?"
Teabing
shrugged.
"Conspiracy
theorists
will
tell
you
it
stands
for
Matrimonio
or
Mary
Magdalene.
To
be
honest,
nobody
is
certain.
The
only
certainty
is
that
the
hidden
M
is
no
mistake.
Countless
Grail
related
works
contain
the
hidden
letter
M
whether
as
watermarks,
underpaintings,
or
compositional
allusions.
The
most
blatant
M,
of
course,
is
emblazoned
on
the
altar
at
Our
Lady
of
Paris
in
London,
which
was
designed
by
a
former
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion,
Jean
Cocteau."
Sophie
weighed
the
information.
"I'll
admit,
the
hidden
M's
are
intriguing,
although
I
assume
nobody
is
claiming
they
are
proof
of
Jesus'
marriage
to
Magdalene."
"No,
no,"
Teabing
said,
going
to
a
nearby
table
of
books.
"As
I
said
earlier,
the
marriage
of
Jesus
and
Mary
Magdalene
is
part
of
the
historical
record.
"
He
began
pawing
through
his
book
collection.
"Moreover,
Jesus
as
a
married
man
makes
infinitely
more
sense
than
our
standard
biblical
view
of
Jesus
as
a
bachelor.
"Why?"
Sophie
asked.
"Because
Jesus
was
a
Jew,"
Langdon
said,
taking
over
while
Teabing
searched
for
his
book,
"and
the
social
decorum
