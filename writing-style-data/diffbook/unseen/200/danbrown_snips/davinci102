radios
the
signal
back
to
the
command
post."
"This
is
impossible,"
Langdon
stammered.
"I
have
an
alibi.
I
went
directly
back
to
my
hotel
after
my
lecture.
You
can
ask
the
hotel
desk."
"Fache
already
did.
His
report
shows
you
retrieving
your
room
key
from
the
concierge
at
about
ten
thirty.
Unfortunately,
the
time
of
the
murder
was
closer
to
eleven.
You
easily
could
have
left
your
hotel
room
unseen."
"This
is
insanity!
Fache
has
no
evidence!"
Sophie's
eyes
widened
as
if
to
say:
No
evidence?
"Mr.
Langdon,
your
name
is
written
on
the
floor
beside
the
body,
and
Sauniere's
date
book
says
you
were
with
him
at
approximately
the
time
of
the
murder."
She
paused.
"Fache
has
more
than
enough
evidence
to
take
you
into
custody
for
questioning."
Langdon
suddenly
sensed
that
he
needed
a
lawyer.
"I
didn't
do
this."
Sophie
sighed.
"This
is
not
American
television,
Mr.
Langdon.
In
France,
the
laws
protect
the
police,
not
criminals.
Unfortunately,
in
this
case,
there
is
also
the
media
consideration.
Jacques
Sauniere
was
a
very
prominent
and
well
loved
figure
in
Paris,
and
his
murder
will
be
news
in
the
morning.
Fache
will
be
under
immediate
pressure
to
make
a
statement,
