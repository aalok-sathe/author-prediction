Sophie
was
not
thinking
what
she
seemed
to
be
thinking.
"Sophie,
there's
no
way
I'm
jump
"Take
out
the
tracking
dot."
Bewildered,
Langdon
fumbled
in
his
pocket
until
he
found
the
tiny
metallic
disk.
Sophie
took
it
from
him
and
strode
immediately
to
the
sink.
She
grabbed
a
thick
bar
of
soap,
placed
the
tracking
dot
on
top
of
it,
and
used
her
thumb
to
push
the
disk
down
hard
into
the
bar.
As
the
disk
sank
into
the
soft
surface,
she
pinched
the
hole
closed,
firmly
embedding
the
device
in
the
bar.
Handing
the
bar
to
Langdon,
Sophie
retrieved
a
heavy,
cylindrical
trash
can
from
under
the
sinks.
Before
Langdon
could
protest,
Sophie
ran
at
the
window,
holding
the
can
before
her
like
a
battering
ram.
Driving
the
bottom
of
the
trash
can
into
the
center
of
the
window,
she
shattered
the
glass.
Alarms
erupted
overhead
at
earsplitting
decibel
levels.
"Give
me
the
soap!"
Sophie
yelled,
barely
audible
over
the
alarm.
Langdon
thrust
the
bar
into
her
hand.
Palming
the
soap,
she
peered
out
the
shattered
window
at
the
eighteen
wheeler
idling
below.
The
target
was
plenty
big
an
expansive,
stationary
tarp
and
it
was
less
than
ten
