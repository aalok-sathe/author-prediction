has
gone
terribly
wrong.
Closing
his
eyes,
Aringarosa
said
a
prayer
that
Bezu
Fache
would
have
the
means
to
fix
it.
Teabing
sat
on
the
divan,
cradling
the
wooden
box
on
his
lap
and
admiring
the
lid's
intricate
inlaid
Rose.
Tonight
has
become
the
strangest
and
most
magical
night
of
my
life.
"Lift
the
lid,"
Sophie
whispered,
standing
over
him,
beside
Langdon.
Teabing

spent
over
a
decade
searching
for

all
over
France,
paying
for
special
access,
examining
hundreds
of
archways
beneath
rose
windows,
searching
for
an
encrypted
keystone.
La
clef
de
voute
a
stone
key
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
Teabing
slowly
unlatched
the
lid
and
raised
it.
As
his
eyes
finally
gazed
upon
the
contents,
he
knew
in
an
instant

could
only
be
the
keystone.
He
was
staring
at
a
stone
cylinder,
