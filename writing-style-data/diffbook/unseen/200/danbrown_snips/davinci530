churches
were
their
strongholds
and
their
banks."
"Banks?"
Sophie
asked,
glancing
at
Leigh.
"Heavens,
yes.
The
Templars
invented
the
concept
of
modern
banking.
For
European
nobility,
traveling
with
gold
was
perilous,
so
the
Templars
allowed
nobles
to
deposit
gold
in
their
nearest
Temple
Church
and
then
draw
it
from
any
other
Temple
Church
across
Europe.
All
they
needed

Teabing
pointed
toward
a
stained

window

some

more
influence
than
the
king
himself.
"
As
they
arrived
outside
the
circular
chamber,
Teabing
shot
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
altar
boy,
who
was
vacuuming
in
the
distance.
"You
know,"
Teabing
whispered
to
Sophie,
"the
Holy
Grail
is
said
to
once
have
been
stored
