"So
what
do
you
think?"
her
grandfather
whispered,
arriving
behind
her.
"Beautiful,
yes?"
"She's
too
little."
Sauniere
smiled.
"You're
little
and
you're
beautiful."
am
not
beautiful,
she
thought.
Sophie
hated
her
red
hair
and
freckles,
and
she
was
bigger
than
all
the
boys
in
her
class.
She
looked
back
at
the
Mona
Lisa
and
shook
her
head.
"She's
even
worse
than
in
the
books.
Her
face
is
brumeux.
"Foggy,"
her
grandfather
tutored.
"Foggy,"
Sophie
repeated,
knowing
the
conversation
would
not
continue
until
she
repeated
her
new
vocabulary
word.
"That's
called
the
sfumato
style
of
painting,"
he
told
her,
"and
it's
very
hard
to
do.
Leonardo
da
Vinci
was
better
at
it
than
anyone."
Sophie
still
didn't
like
the
painting.
"She
looks
like
she
knows
something
like
when
kids
at
school
have
a
secret.
Her
grandfather
laughed.
"That's
part
of
why
she
is
so
famous.
People
like
to
guess
why
she
is
smiling."
"Do
you
know
why
she's
smiling?"
"Maybe."
Her
grandfather
winked.
"Someday
I'll
tell
you
all
about
it."
Sophie
stamped
her
foot.
"I
told
you
I
don't
like
secrets!"
"Princess,"
he
smiled.
"Life
is
filled
with
secrets.
You
can't
learn
them
all
at
once."
"I'm
going
back
up,"
Sophie
