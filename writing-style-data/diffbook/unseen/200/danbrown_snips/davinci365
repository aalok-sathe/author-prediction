penises
you
have,
the
higher
your
rank.
Boys
will
be
boys."
Langdon
winced.
"Moving
on,
the
female
symbol,
as
you
might
imagine,
is
the
exact
opposite."
He
drew
another
symbol
on
the
page.
"This
is
called
the
chalice.
Sophie
glanced
up,
looking
surprised.
Langdon
could
see
she
had
made
the
connection.
"The
chalice,"
he
said,
"resembles
a
cup
or
vessel,
and
more
important,
it
resembles
the
shape
of
a
woman's
womb.
This
symbol
communicates
femininity,
womanhood,
and
fertility."
Langdon
looked
directly
at
her
now.
"Sophie,
legend
tells
us
the
Holy
Grail
is
a
chalice
a
cup.
But
the
Grail's
description
as
a
chalice
is
actually
an
allegory
to
protect
the
true
nature
of
the
Holy
Grail.
That
is
to
say,
the
legend
uses
the
chalice
as
a
metaphor
for
something
far
more
important."
"A
woman,"
Sophie
said.
"Exactly."
Langdon
smiled.
"The
Grail
is
literally
the
ancient
symbol
for
womanhood,
and
the
Holy
Grail
represents
the
sacred
feminine
and
the
goddess,
which
of
course
has
now
been
lost,
virtually
eliminated
by
the
Church.
The
power
of
the
female
and
her
ability
to
produce
life
was
once
very
sacred,
but
it
posed
a
threat
to
the
rise
of
the
predominantly
male
Church,
