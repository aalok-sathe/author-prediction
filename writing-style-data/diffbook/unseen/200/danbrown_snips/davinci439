you
shortly."
He
hung
up.
"Elizabeth?"
Langdon
said.
"My
plane.
She
cost
me
a
Queen's
ransom."
Langdon
turned
full
around
and
looked
at
him.
"What?"
Teabing
demanded.
"You
two
can't
expect
to
stay
in
France
with
the
entire
Judicial
Police
after
you.
London
will
be
much
safer."
Sophie
had
turned
to
Teabing
as
well.
"You
think
we
should
leave
the
country?"
"My
friends,
I
am
far
more
influential
in
the
civilized
world
than
here
in
France.
Furthermore,
the
Grail
is
believed
to
be
in
Great
Britain.
If
we
unlock
the
keystone,
I
am
certain
we
will
discover
a
map
that
indicates
we
have
moved
in
the
proper
direction."
"You're
running
a
big
risk,"
Sophie
said,
"by
helping
us.
You
won't
make
any
friends
with
the
French
police."
Teabing
gave
a
wave
of
disgust.
"I
am
finished
with
France.
I
moved
here
to
find
the
keystone.
That
work
is
now
done.
I
shan't
care
if
I
ever
again
see
Chateau
Villette."
Sophie
sounded
uncertain.
"How
will
we
get
through
airport
security?"
Teabing
chuckled.
"I
fly
from
Le
Bourget
an
executive
airfield
not
far
from
here.
French
doctors
make
me
nervous,
so
every
fortnight,
I
fly
north
to
take
my
treatments
in
