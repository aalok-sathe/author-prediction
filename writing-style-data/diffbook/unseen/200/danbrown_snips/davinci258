indeed
Da
Vinci's
work,
the
painting
itself
was
not.
The
truth
was
that
some
anonymous
painter
had
filled
in
Da
Vinci's
sketch
like
a
paint
by
numbers
years
after
Da
Vinci's
death.
Far
more
troubling,
however,
was
what
lay
beneath
the
impostor's
paint.
Photographs
taken
with
infrared
reflectography
and
X
ray
suggested
that
this
rogue
painter,
while
filling
in
Da
Vinci's
sketched
study,
had
made
suspicious
departures
from
the
underdrawing
as
if
to
subvert
Da
Vinci's
true
intention.
Whatever
the
true
nature
of
the
underdrawing,
it
had
yet
to
be
made
public.
Even
so,
embarrassed
officials
at
Florence's
Uffizi
Gallery
immediately
banished
the
painting
to
a
warehouse
across
the
street.
Visitors
at
the
gallery's
Leonardo
Room
now
found
a
misleading
and
unapologetic
plaque
where
the
Adoration
once
hung.
THIS
WORK
IS
UNDERGOING
DIAGNOSTIC
TESTS
IN
PREPARATION
FOR
RESTORATION.
In
the
bizarre
underworld
of
modern
Grail
seekers,
Leonardo
da
Vinci
remained
the
quest's
great
enigma.
His
artwork
seemed
bursting
to
tell
a
secret,
and
yet
whatever
it
was
remained
hidden,
perhaps
beneath
a
layer
of
paint,
perhaps
enciphered
in
plain
view,
or
perhaps
nowhere
at
all.
Maybe
Da
Vinci's
plethora
of
tantalizing
clues
was
nothing
but
an
empty
promise
left
behind
