calling
Interpol."
Collet
looked
surprised.
"You're
putting
this
on
the
wire?"
Fache
regretted
the
potential
embarrassment,
but
he
saw
no
other
choice.
Close
the
net
fast,
and
close
it
tight.
The
first
hour
was
critical.
Fugitives
were
predictable
the
first
hour
after
escape.
They
always
needed
the
same
thing.
Travel.
Lodging.
Cash.
The
Holy
Trinity.
Interpol
had
the
power
to
make
all

disappear
in
the
blink
of
an
eye.
By

Whatever

committed,
they
quickly
made
their
whereabouts
known
to
local
authorities.
"Only
Langdon,
right?"
Collet
said.
"You're
not
flagging
Sophie
Neveu.
She's
our
own
agent."
"Of
course
I'm
flagging
her!"
Fache
snapped.
"What
good
is
flagging
Langdon
if
she
can

dirty
work?
I
plan
to
run
Neveu's
employment

friends,
family,

she
might
turn
to

I
