men
disappeared
into
his
study
and
closed
the
door.
My
grandfather
wrote
something
in
the
paper?
Sophie
immediately
ran
to
the
kitchen
and
flipped
through
that
morning's
paper.
She
found
her
grandfather's
name
on
an
article
on
the
second
page.
She
read
it.
Sophie
didn't
understand
all
of
what
was
said,
but
it
sounded
like
the
French
government,
under
pressure
from
priests,
had
agreed
to
ban
an
American
movie
called
The
Last
Temptation
of
Christ,
which
was

Jesus
having

"It's

Sacrilege!"
the
priest
yelled,

from
the
study
and

"How

This
American
Martin
Scorsese
is
a
blasphemer,
and
the
Church
will
permit
him
no
pulpit
in
France
!
"
The
priest
slammed
the
door
on
his
way
out.
When
her
grandfather
came
into
the
kitchen,
he
saw
Sophie
with
the
paper
and
frowned.
"You're
quick."
Sophie
said,
"You
think
Jesus
Christ
had
a
girlfriend?"
"No,
dear,
I
said
the
Church
should
not
be
allowed
to
tell
us
what
notions
