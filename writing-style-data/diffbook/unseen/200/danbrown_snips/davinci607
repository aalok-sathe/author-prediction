backed
off
at
once
when
the
Teacher
glared
indignantly
and
flashed
his
identification
card.
Official
rank
always
commanded
the
proper
respect.
Although
initially
the
Teacher
had
hoped
to
solve
the
cryptex
alone
and
avoid
any
further
complications,
he
now
sensed
that
the
arrival
of
Langdon
and
Neveu
was
actually
a
welcome
development.
Considering
the
lack
of
success
he
was
having
with
the
"orb"
reference,
he
might
be
able
to
use
their
expertise.
After
all,
if
Langdon
had
deciphered
the
poem
to
find
the
tomb,
there
was
a
reasonable
chance

And

Langdon
knew
the
password,
then
it
was
just
a
matter
of
applying
the
right
pressure.
Not
here,
of
course.
Somewhere
private.
The
Teacher
recalled
a
small
announcement
sign
he
had
seen
on
his
way
into
the
abbey.
Immediately
he
knew
the
perfect
place
to
lure
them.
The
only
question
now
what
to
use
as
bait.
Langdon
and
Sophie
moved
slowly
down
the
north
aisle,
keeping
to
the
shadows
behind
the
ample
pillars
that
separated
it
from
the
open
nave.
Despite
having
traveled
more
than
halfway
down
the
nave,
they
still
had
no
clear
view
of
Newton's
tomb.
The
