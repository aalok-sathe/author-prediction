The

its

the
traffic
like

knife.
"he
capitaine
was
pleased
to
discover
you
were
still
in
Paris
tonight,"
the
agent
said,
speaking
for
the
first
time
since
they'd
left
the
hotel.
"A
fortunate
coincidence."
Langdon
was
feeling
anything
but
fortunate,
and
coincidence
was
a
concept
he
did
not
entirely
trust.
As
someone
who
had
spent
his
life
exploring
the
hidden
interconnectivity
of
disparate
emblems
and
ideologies,
Langdon
viewed
the
world
as
a
web
of
profoundly
intertwined
histories
and
events.
The
connections
may
be
invisible,
he
often
preached
to
his
symbology
classes
at
Harvard,
but
they
are
always
there,
buried
just
beneath
the
surface.
"I
assume,"
Langdon
said,
"that
the
American
University
of
Paris
told
you
where
I
was
staying?"
The
driver
shook
his
head.
"Interpol."
Interpol,
Langdon
thought.
Of
course.
He
had
forgotten
that
the
seemingly
innocuous
request
of
all
European
hotels
to
see
a
passport
at
check
in
was
more
than
a
quaint
formality
it
was
the
law.
On
any
given
night,
all
across
Europe,
Interpol
officials
could
pinpoint
exactly
who
was
sleeping
where.
