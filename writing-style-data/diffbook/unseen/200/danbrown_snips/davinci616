They
were
standing
in
an
enormous
dead
end.
The
creaking
of
a
heavy
door
behind
them
made
them
turn,
just
as
the
door
closed
with
a
resounding
thud
and
the
latch
fell
into
place.
The
lone
man
who
had
been
standing
behind
the
door
looked
calm
as
he
aimed
a
small
revolver
at
them.
He
was
portly
and
was
propped
on
a
pair
of
aluminum
crutches.
For
a
moment
Langdon
thought
he
must
be
dreaming.
It
was
Leigh
Teabing.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
felt
rueful
as
he
gazed
out
over
the
barrel
of
his
Medusa
revolver
at
Robert
Langdon
and
Sophie
Neveu.
"My
friends,"
he
said,
"since
the
moment
you
walked
into
my
home
last
night,
I
have
done
everything
in
my
power
to
keep
you
out
of
harm's
way.
But
your
persistence
has
now
put
me
in
a
difficult
position."
He
could
see
the
expressions
of
shock
and
betrayal
on
Sophie's
and
Langdon's
faces,
and
yet
he
was
confident
that
soon
they
would
both
understand
the
chain
of
events
that
had
guided
the
three
of
them
to
this
unlikely
crossroads.
There
is
so
much
I
have
to
tell
you
both
so
much
you
do
not
yet
understand.
"Please
believe,"
Teabing
