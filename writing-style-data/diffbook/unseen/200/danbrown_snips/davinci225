Vatican
officials
to
piggyback
on
Opus
Dei's
recent
public
success
the
completion
of
their
World
Headquarters
in
New
York
City.
Architectural
Digest
had
called
Opus
Dei's
building
"a
shining
beacon
of
Catholicism
sublimely
integrated
with
the
modern
landscape,"
and
lately
the
Vatican
seemed
to
be
drawn
to
anything
and
everything
that
included
the
word
"modern."
Aringarosa
had
no
choice
but
to
accept
the
invitation,
albeit
reluctantly.
Not
a
fan
of
the
current
papal

Aringarosa,
like
most
conservative
clergy,
had
watched
with
grave
concern

being
humbled
by
his
unexpected
rise
to
power,
the
Holy

had
wasted
no
time
flexing
all
the
muscle
associated
with
the
highest
office
in
Christendom.
Drawing
on
an
unsettling
tide
of
liberal
support
within
the
College
of
Cardinals,
the
Pope
was
now
declaring
his
papal
mission
to
be
"rejuvenation
of
Vatican
doctrine
and
updating
Catholicism
into
the
third
millennium."
The
translation,
Aringarosa
feared,
was
that
the
man
was
actually
arrogant
enough
to
think
he

God's
laws
