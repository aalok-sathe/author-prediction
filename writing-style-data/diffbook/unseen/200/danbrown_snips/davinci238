everything

As
Langdon
gathered
his
thoughts
to
tell
Sophie
about
the
Priory
of
Sion,
their
taxi
passed
through
the
wooded
entrance
to
the
park
and
began
heading
west
on
the
cobblestone
crossfare.
Langdon
was
having
trouble
concentrating
as
a
scattering
of
the
park's
nocturnal
residents
were
already
emerging
from
the
shadows
and
flaunting
their
wares
in
the
glare
of
the
headlights.
Ahead,
two
topless
teenage
girls
shot
smoldering
gazes
into
the
taxi.
Beyond
them,
a
well
oiled
black
man
in
a
G
string
turned
and
flexed
his
buttocks.
Beside
him,
a
gorgeous
blond
woman
lifted
her
miniskirt
to
reveal
that
she
was
not,
in
fact,
a
woman.
Heaven
help
me!
Langdon
turned
his
gaze
back
inside
the
cab
and
took
a
deep
breath.
"Tell
me
about
the
Priory
of
Sion,"
Sophie
said.
Langdon
nodded,
unable
to
imagine
a
less
congruous
a
backdrop
for
the
legend
he
was
about
to
tell.
He
wondered
where
to
begin.
The
brotherhood's
history
spanned
more
than
a
millennium
an
astonishing
chronicle
of
secrets,
blackmail,
betrayal,
and
even
brutal
torture
at
the
hands
of
an
angry
Pope.
