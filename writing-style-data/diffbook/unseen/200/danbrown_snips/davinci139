"Recognize
this?"
"It's
a
nautilus,"
the
bio
major
said.
"A
cephalopod
mollusk
that
pumps
gas
into
its
chambered
shell
to
adjust
its
buoyancy."
"Correct.
And
can
you
guess
what
the
ratio
is
of
each
spiral's
diameter
to
the
next?"
The
girl
looked
uncertain
as
she
eyed
the
concentric
arcs
of
the
nautilus
spiral.
Langdon
nodded.
"PHI.
The
Divine
Proportion.
One
point
six
one
eight
to
one."
The
girl
looked
amazed.
Langdon
advanced
to
the
next
slide
a
close
up
of
a
sunflower's
seed
head.
"Sunflower
seeds
grow
in
opposing
spirals.
Can
you
guess
the
ratio
of
each
rotation's
diameter
to
the
next?"
"PHI?"
everyone
said.
"Bingo."
Langdon
began
racing
through
slides
now
spiraled
pinecone
petals,
leaf
arrangement
on
plant
stalks,
insect
segmentation
all
displaying
astonishing
obedience
to
the
Divine
Proportion.
"This
is
amazing!"
someone
cried
out.
"Yeah,"
someone
else
said,
"but
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
art?"
"Aha!"
Langdon
said.
"Glad
you
asked."
He
pulled
up
another
slide
a
pale
yellow
parchment
displaying
Leonardo
da
Vinci's
famous
male
nude
The
Vitruvian
Man
named
for
Marcus
Vitruvius,
the
brilliant
Roman
architect
who
praised
the
Divine
Proportion
in
his
text
De
Architectura.
"Nobody
understood
better
than
Da
Vinci
the
divine
