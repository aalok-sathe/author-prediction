the
box
on
the
ground
for
the
moment,
he
grabbed
the
metal
door
and
began
to
heave
it
closed.
As
the
door
swung
past
him,
Vernet
reached
up
to
grab
the
single
bolt
that
needed
to
be
slid
into
place.
The
door
closed
with
a
thud,
and
Vernet
quickly
grabbed
the
bolt,
pulling
it
to
the
left.
The
bolt
slid
a
few
inches
and
crunched
to
an
unexpected
halt,
not
lining
up
with
its
sleeve.
What's
going
on?
Vernet
pulled
again,
but
the
bolt
wouldn't
lock.
The
mechanism
was
not
properly
aligned.
The
door
isn't
fully
closed!
Feeling
a
surge
of
panic,
Vernet
shoved
hard
against
the
outside
of
the
door,
but
it
refused
to
budge.
Something
is
blocking
it!
Vernet
turned
to
throw
full
shoulder
into
the
door,
but
this
time
the
door
exploded
outward,
striking
Vernet
in
the
face
and
sending
him
reeling
backward
onto
the
ground,
his
nose
shattering
in
pain.
The
gun
flew
as
Vernet
reached
for
his
face
and
felt
the
warm
blood
running
from
his
nose.
Robert
Langdon
hit
the
ground
somewhere
nearby,
and
Vernet
tried
to
get
up,
but
he
couldn't
see.
His
vision
blurred
and
he
fell
backward
again.
