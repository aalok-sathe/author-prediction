Magdalene
and
slicing
his
blade
like
hand
across
her
neck.
The
same
threatening
gesture
as
in
Madonna
of
the
Rocks!
"And
here
too,"
Langdon
said,
pointing
now
to
the
crowd
of
disciples
near
Peter.
"A
bit
ominous,
no?"
Sophie
squinted
and
saw
a
hand
emerging
from
the
crowd
of
disciples.
"Is
that
hand
wielding
a
dagger?"
"Yes.
Stranger
still,
if
you
count
the
arms,
you'll
see
that
this
hand
belongs
to
no
one
at
all.
It's
disembodied.
Anonymous."

rub!"
He
turned

more
to
the
table
and

It
was
an

"Few
people
realize
that
Mary
Magdalene,
in
addition
to
being
Christ's
right
hand,
was
a
powerful
woman
already."
Sophie
could
now
see
the
title
of
the
family
tree.
THE
TRIBE
OF
BENJAMIN
"Mary
Magdalene
is
here,"
Teabing
said,
pointing
near
the
top
of
the
genealogy.
Sophie
was
surprised.
"She
was
of
the
House
of
Benjamin?"
"Indeed,"
Teabing
said.
"Mary
Magdalene
was
of
royal
descent."
"But
I
was
