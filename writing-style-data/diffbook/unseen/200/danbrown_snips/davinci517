ever
been
there?"
Sophie
and
Langdon
shook
their
heads.
"I'm
not
surprised,"
Teabing
said.
"The
church
is
hidden
now
behind
much
larger
buildings.
Few
people
even
know
it's
there.
Eerie
old
place.
The
architecture
is
pagan
to
the
core."
Sophie
looked
surprised.
"Pagan?"
"Pantheonically
pagan!"
Teabing
exclaimed.
"The
church
is
round.
The
Templars
ignored
the
traditional
Christian
cruciform
layout
and
built
a
perfectly
circular
church
in
honor
of
the
sun."
His
eyebrows
did
a
devilish
dance.
"A
not
so
subtle
howdy
do
to
the
boys
in
Rome.
They
might
as

in
downtown
London."
Sophie
eyed
Teabing.
"What
about
the
rest
of
the
poem?"
The
historian's
mirthful
air
faded.
"I'm

puzzling.
We
will
need
to
examine
each
of
the
ten
tombs
carefully.
With
luck,
one
of
them
will
have
a
conspicuously
absent
orb."
Langdon
realized
how
close
they
really
were.
If
the
missing
orb
revealed
the
password,
they
would
be
able
to
open
the
second
cryptex.
He
had
a
hard
time
imagining
what
they
might
find
inside.
Langdon
eyed
the
poem
again.
It
was
like
some
kind
of
primordial
crossword
puzzle.
A
five
letter
word
that
speaks
of
the
Grail?
On
the
plane,
