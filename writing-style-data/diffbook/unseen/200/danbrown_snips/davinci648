outstretched
arms
hit
first,
and
the
cryptex
collided
hard
with
the
floor.
There
was
a
sickening
crunch
of
glass
within.
For
a
full
second,
Teabing
did
not
breathe.
Lying
there
outstretched
on
the
cold
floor,
staring
the
length
of
his
outstretched
arms
at
the
marble
cylinder
in
his
bare
palms,
he
implored
the
glass
vial
inside
to
hold.
Then
the
acrid
tang
of
vinegar
cut
the
air,
and
Teabing
felt
the
cool
liquid
flowing
out
through
the
dials
onto
his
palm.
Wild
panic
gripped
him.
NO!
The
vinegar
was
streaming
now,
and
Teabing
pictured
the
papyrus
dissolving
within.
Robert,
you
fool!
The
secret
is
lost!
Teabing
felt
himself
sobbing
uncontrollably.
The
Grail
is
gone.
Everything
destroyed.
Shuddering
in
disbelief
over
Langdon's
actions,
Teabing
tried
to
force
the
cylinder
apart,
longing
to
catch
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
history
before
it
dissolved
forever.
To
his
shock,
as
he
pulled
the
ends
of
the
keystone,
the
cylinder
separated.
He
gasped
and
peered
inside.
It
was
empty
except
for
shards
of
wet
glass.
No
dissolving
papyrus.
Teabing
rolled
over
and
looked
up
at
Langdon.
Sophie
stood
beside
him,
aiming
the
gun
down
at
Teabing.
Bewildered,
Teabing
looked
back
at
the
keystone
and
saw
it.
