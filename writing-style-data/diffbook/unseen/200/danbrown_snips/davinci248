flabbergasted.
"Robert,"
Faukman
finally
said,
"don't
get
me
wrong.
I
love
your
work,
and
we've
had
a
great
run
together.
But
if
I
agree
to
publish
an
idea
like
this,
I'll
have
people
picketing
outside
my
office
for
months.
Besides,
it
will
kill
your
reputation.
You're
a
Harvard
historian,
for
God's
sake,
not
a
pop
schlockmeister
looking
for
a
quick
buck.
Where
could
you
possibly
find
enough
credible
evidence
to
support
a
theory
like
this?"
With
a
quiet
smile
Langdon
pulled
a
piece
of
paper
from
the
pocket
of
his
tweed
coat
and
handed
it
to
Faukman.
The
page
listed
a
bibliography
of
over
fifty
titles
books
by
well
known
historians,
some
contemporary,
some
centuries
old
many
of
them
academic
bestsellers.
All
the
book
titles
suggested
the
same
premise
Langdon
had
just
proposed.
As
Faukman
read
down
the
list,
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
just
discovered
the
earth
was
actually
flat.
"I
know
some
of
these
authors.
They're
real
historians!"
Langdon
grinned.
"As
you
can
see,
Jonas,
this
is
not
only
my
theory.
It's
been
around
for
a
long
time.
I'm
simply
building
on
it.
No
book
has
yet
explored
the
legend
of
the
Holy
Grail
from
