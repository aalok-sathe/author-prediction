crypt.
Whirring
to
a
stop
over
the
correct
spot
on
the
floor,
the
claw
dropped
down,
an
electric
eye
confirming
the
bar
code
on
the
box.
Then,
with
computer
precision,
the
claw
grasped
the
heavy
handle
and
hoisted
the
crate
vertically.
New
gears
engaged,
and
the
claw
transported
the
box
to
the
far
side
of
the
vault,
coming
to
a
stop
over
a
stationary
conveyor
belt.
Gently

belt
whirred

Upstairs,
Sophie

room

a
narrow

beneath
a
retractable
door.
The
metal
door
slid
up,
and
a
huge
plastic
box
appeared,
emerging
from
the
depths
on
the
inclined
conveyor
belt.
The
box
was
black,
heavy
molded
plastic,
and
far
larger
than
she
imagined.
It
looked
like
an
air
freight
pet
transport
crate
without
any
airholes.
The
box
coasted
to
a
stop
directly
in
front
of
them.
