easily
fooled
into
taking
him
from
the
church
and
then
watching
naively
as
Remy
pretended
to
tie
their
hostage
in
the
back
of
the
limousine.
With
the
soundproof
divider
raised,
Teabing
was
able
to
phone
Silas
in
the
front
seat,
use
the
fake
French
accent
of
the
Teacher,
and

Silas
to
go
straight
to
Opus
Dei.
A
simple
anonymous
tip
to
the
police
was
all
it
would
take
to
remove
Silas
from

The

The

at

of
the
can
would
be
more
than

on
Horse
Guards
Parade,
Teabing
climbed
out

the
back,
walked
