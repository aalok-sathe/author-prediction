the
film
to
reveal
a
freeze
frame
in
which
the
word
SEX
was
clearly
visible,
spelled
out

Simba's

Although
Langdon
suspected
this
was
more
of
a
cartoonist's
sophomoric
prank
than
any
kind
of
enlightened
allusion
to
pagan
human
sexuality,
he
had
learned
not
to
underestimate
Disney's
grasp
of
symbolism.
The
Little
Mermaid
was
a
spellbinding
tapestry
of
spiritual
symbols
so
specifically
goddess
related
that
they
could
not
be
coincidence.
When
Langdon
had
first
seen
The
Little
Mermaid,
he
had
actually
gasped
aloud
when
he
noticed
that
the
painting
in
Ariel's
underwater
home
was
none
other
than
seventeenth
century
artist
Georges
de
la
Tour's
The
Penitent
Magdalene
a
famous
homage
to
the
banished
Mary
Magdalene
fitting
decor
considering
the
movie
turned
out
to
be
a
ninety
minute
collage
of
blatant
symbolic
references
to
the
lost
sanctity
of
Isis,
Eve,
Pisces
the
fish
goddess,
and,
repeatedly,
Mary
Magdalene.
The
Little
Mermaid's
name,
Ariel,
possessed
powerful
ties
to
the
sacred
feminine
and,
in
the
Book
of
Isaiah,
was
synonymous
with
"the
Holy
City
besieged."
Of
course,
the
Little
Mermaid's
flowing
red
hair
was
certainly
no
coincidence
either.
