out
through
a
series
of
interconnected
galleries.
Langdon
followed,
his
vision
slowly
adjusting
to
the
dark.
All
around,
large
format
oils
began
to
materialize
like
photos
developing
before
him
in
an
enormous
darkroom
their
eyes
following
as
he
moved
through
the
rooms.
He
could
taste
the
familiar
tang
of
museum
air
an
arid,
deionized
essence
that
carried
a
faint
hint
of
carbon
the
product
of
industrial,
coal
filter
dehumidifiers
that
ran
around
the
clock
to
counteract
the
corrosive
carbon
dioxide
exhaled
by
visitors.
Mounted
high
on
the
walls,
the
visible
security
cameras
sent
a
clear
message
to
visitors:
We
see
you.
Do
not
touch
anything.
"Any
of
them
real?"
Langdon
asked,
motioning
to
the
cameras.
Fache
shook
his
head.
"Of
course
not."
Langdon
was
not
surprised.
Video
surveillance
in
museums
this
size
was
cost
prohibitive
and
ineffective.
With
acres
of
galleries
to
watch
over,
the
Louvre
would
require
several
hundred
technicians
simply
to
monitor
the
feeds.
Most
large
museums
now
used
"containment
security."
Forget
keeping
thieves
out.
Keep
them
in.
Containment
was
activated
after
hours,
and
if
an
intruder
removed
a
piece
of
artwork,
compartmentalized
exits
would
seal
around
that
gallery,
and
the
thief
would
find
himself
behind
bars
