and
sacred
feminine."
Fache's
expression
clouded.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"Replication.
Repeating
a
symbol
is
the
simplest
way
to
strengthen
its
meaning.
Jacques
Sauniere
positioned
himself
in
the
shape
of
a
five
pointed
star."
If
one
pentacle
is
good,
two
is
better.
Fache's
eyes
followed
the
five
points
of
Sauniere's
arms,
legs,
and
head
as
he
again
ran
a
hand
across
his
slick
hair.
"Interesting
analysis."
He
paused.
"And
the
nudity?"
He
grumbled
as
he
spoke
the
word,
sounding
repulsed
by
the
sight
of
an
aging
male
body.
"Why
did
he
remove
his
clothing?"
Damned
good
question,
Langdon
thought.
He'd
been
wondering
the
same
thing
ever
since
he
first
saw
the
Polaroid.
His
best
guess
was
that
a
naked
human
form
was
yet
another
endorsement
of
Venus
the
goddess
of
human
sexuality.
Although
modern
culture
had
erased
much
of
Venus's
association
with
the
malefemale
physical
union,
a
sharp
etymological
eye
could
still
spot
a
vestige
of
Venus's
original
meaning
in
the
word
"venereal."
Langdon
decided
not
to
go
there.
"Mr.
Fache,
I
obviously
can't
tell
you
why
Mr.
Sauniere
drew
that
symbol
on
himself
or
placed
himself
in
this
way,
but
I
can
tell
you
that
a
man
like
Jacques
