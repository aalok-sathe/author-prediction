wonder
why
we
arrived
in
a
wrecked
armored
truck."
Sophie
nodded.
"What
do
we
do
with
the
cryptex?
We
probably
shouldn't
leave
it
out
here,
but
if
Leigh
sees
it,
he'll
certainly
want
to
know
what
it
is."
"Not
to
worry,"
Langdon
said,
removing
his
jacket
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
car.
He
wrapped
the
tweed
coat
around
the
box
and
held
the
bundle
in
his
arms
like
a
baby.
Sophie
looked
dubious.
"Subtle."
"Teabing
never

a

tonight
would
strike
her
as
strange
anymore.
The
pathway
to
the
main
entrance
was
hand
laid
cobblestone.
It
curved
to
a
door
of
carved
oak
and
cherry
with
a
brass
knocker
the
size
of
a
grapefruit.
Before
Sophie
could
grasp
the
knocker,
the
door
swung
open
from
within.
A
prim
and
elegant
butler
stood
before
them,
making
final
adjustments
on
the
white
tie
and
tuxedo
he
had
apparently
just
donned.
He
looked
