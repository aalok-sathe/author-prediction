Please
be
assured
that
my
distaste
for
the
French
extends
only
to
politics
and
the
soccer
pitch.
Your
government
steals
my
money,
and
your
football
squad
recently
humiliated
us."
Sophie
offered
an
easy
smile.
Teabing
eyed
her
a
moment
and
then
looked
at
Langdon.
"Something
has
happened.
You
both
look
shaken.
Langdon
nodded.
"We've
had
an
interesting
night,
Leigh."
"No
doubt.
You
arrive
on
my
doorstep

the
couch.

Langdon
said,
"we'd
like
to
talk
to
you
about
the
Priory
of
Sion."
Teabing's
bushy
eyebrows
arched
with
intrigue.
"The
keepers.
So
this
is
indeed
about
the
Grail.
You
say
you
come
with
information?
Something
new,
Robert?"
"Perhaps.
We're
not
quite
sure.
We
might
have
a
better
idea
if
we
could
get
some
information
from
you
first."
Teabing
wagged
his
finger.
"Ever

wily
American.
A

Very
well.
