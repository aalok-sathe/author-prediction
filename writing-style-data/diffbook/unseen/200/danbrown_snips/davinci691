He
turned
due
south,
letting
his
eye
trace
the
extended
line
formed
by
the
medallions.
He
began
moving
again,
following
the
trail,
watching
the
pavement
as
he
walked.
As
he
cut
across
the
corner
of
the
Comedie
Francaise,

bronze
medallion
passed

his
feet.

had
learned
years

across
Rue
de
Rivoli,
he
could
feel
his
destination
within
reach.
Less
than
a
block
away.
The
Holy
Grail
'neath
ancient
Roslin
waits.
The
revelations
were
coming
now
in
waves.
Sauniere's
ancient
spelling
of
Roslin
the

and
chalice

tomb
adorned
with
masters'
