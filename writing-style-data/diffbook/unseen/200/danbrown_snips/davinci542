"Why
isn't
this
knight
shown?"
Langdon
asked.
"Fascinating,"
Teabing
said,
stroking
his
chin.
"I
had
forgotten
about
this
oddity.
It's
been
years
since
I
was
here."
"This
coffin,"
Sophie
said,
"looks
like
it
was
carved
at
the
same
time
and
by
the
same
sculptor
as
the
other
nine
tombs.
So
why
is
this
knight
in
a
casket
rather
than
in
the
open?"
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"One
of

any
explanation

boy
and
turned
to
Langdon.

Wren,
apparently
your
family's
philanthropy
does
not
buy
you
the
time
it
used
to,
so
perhaps
we
should
take
out
the
ashes
and
get
on
with
it."
Teabing
turned
to
Sophie.
"Mrs.
Wren?"
Sophie
played
along,
pulling
the
vellumwrapped
cryptex
from
her
pocket.
"Now
then,"
Teabing
snapped
at
the
boy,
"if
you
would
give
us
some

The
altar
boy
did
not

He
was
eyeing
Langdon
closely
now.
"You
