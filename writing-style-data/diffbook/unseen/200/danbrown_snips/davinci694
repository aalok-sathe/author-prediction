down
there!
Stepping
out
of
the
circle,
he
hurried
across
the
courtyard
back
toward
the
towering
pyramid
entrance
of
the
Louvre.
The
day's
last
visitors
were
trickling
out
of
the
museum.
Pushing
through
the
revolving
door,
Langdon
descended
the
curved
staircase
into
the
pyramid.
He
could
feel
the
air
grow

When
he
reached
the
bottom,
he
entered
the
long
tunnel
that
stretched

Only
three
feet
tall.
The
only
structure
in
this
colossal
complex
that
had
been
built
on
a
small
scale.
Langdon's
manuscript,
while
discussing
the
Louvre's
elaborate
collection
of
goddess
art,
had
made
passing
note
of
this
modest
pyramid.
"The
miniature
structure

up
through
the
floor

it
