the
home
of
Leigh
Teabing?
That
I
happen
to
live
there
is
why
the
Teacher
approached
me
in
the
first
place."
He
paused.
"How
do
you
think
the
Teacher
knows
so
much
about
the
Grail?"
Now
it
dawned,
and
Silas
was
stunned.
The
Teacher
had
recruited
a
servant
who
had
access
to
all
of
Sir
Leigh
Teabing's
research.
It
was
brilliant.
"There
is
much
I
have
to
tell
you,"
Remy
said,
handing
Silas
the
loaded
Heckler
Koch
pistol.
Then
he
reached
through
the
open
partition
and
retrieved
a
small,
palm
sized
revolver
from
the
glove
box.
"But
first,
you
and
I
have
a
job
to
do."
Captain
Fache
descended
from
his
transport
plane
at
Biggin
Hill
and
listened
in
disbelief
to
the
Kent
chief
inspector's
account
of
what
had
happened
in
Teabing's
hangar.
"I
searched
the
plane
myself,"
the
inspector
insisted,
"and
there
was
no
one
inside."
His
tone
turned
haughty.
"And
I
should
add
that
if
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
presses
charges
against
me,
I
will
"Did
you
interrogate
the
pilot?"
"Of
course
not.
He
is
French,
and
our
jurisdiction
requires
"Take
me
to
the
plane."
Arriving
at
the
hangar,
Fache
needed
only
sixty
seconds
to
locate
an
anomalous
smear
