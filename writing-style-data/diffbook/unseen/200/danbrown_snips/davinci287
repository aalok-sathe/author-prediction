right,"
Langdon
confirmed,
carefully
checking
what
they
had
typed
and
comparing
it
to
the
printout.
He
motioned
to
the
ENTER
key.
"Fire
away."
Sophie
extended
her
index
finger
toward
the
keypad,
but
hesitated,
an
odd
thought
now
hitting
her.
"Go
ahead,"
Langdon
urged.
"Vernet
will
be
back
soon."
"No."
She
pulled
her
hand
away.
"This
isn't
the
right
account
number."
"Of
course
it
is!
Ten
digits.
What
else
would
it
be?"
"It's
too
random."
Too
random?
Langdon
could
not
have
disagreed
more.

Sophie
deleted
everything
she
had
just

in
and
looked
up
at
Langdon,
her
gaze
self
assured.
"It's
far
too
coincidental
that
this
supposedly
random
account
number
could
be
rearranged
to
form
the
Fibonacci
sequence.
Langdon
realized
she
had
a
point.
Earlier,
Sophie
had
rearranged
this
account
number
into
the
Fibonacci
sequence.
What
were
the
odds
of
being
able
to
do
that?
Sophie
was
at
the
keypad
again,
entering
a
different
number,
as
if
from
memory.
"Moreover,
with
my
grandfather's
love
of
symbolism
and
codes,
it
seems
to
follow
