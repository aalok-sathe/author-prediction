royal
bloodline."
The
words
seemed
to
echo
across
the
ballroom
and
back
before
they
fully
registered
in
Sophie's
mind.
Mary
Magdalene
carried
the
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ?
"But
how
could
Christ
have
a
bloodline
unless?"
She
paused
and
looked
at
Langdon.
Langdon
smiled
softly.
"Unless
they
had
a
child."
Sophie
stood
transfixed.
"Behold,"
Teabing
proclaimed,
"the
greatest
cover
up
in
human
history.
Not
only
was
Jesus
Christ

but
He

father.
My
dear,
Mary

was

vine
from
which
the
sacred
fruit
sprang
forth!"
Sophie

quiet
all
of
these
years?"
"Heavens!"
Teabing
said.
"It
has
been
anything
but
quiet!
The
royal
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ
is
the
source
of
the
most
enduring
legend
of
all
time
the
Holy
Grail.
Magdalene's
story
has
been
shouted
from
the
rooftops
for
centuries
in
all
kinds
of
metaphors
and
languages.
Her
story
is
everywhere
once
you
open
your
eyes."
"And
the
Sangreal
documents?"
Sophie
said.
"They
allegedly
contain
proof
