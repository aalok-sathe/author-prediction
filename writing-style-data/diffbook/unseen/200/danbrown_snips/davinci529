of

Julius
Caesar.
I'm
certain
nobody
has
ever
performed
the
first
scene
of
Act
Three
with
more
dedication."
Langdon
glanced
over.
"I
thought
Caesar
was
dead
in
that
scene."
Teabing
smirked.
"Yes,
but
my
toga
tore
open
when
I
fell,
and
I
had
to
lie
on
stage
for
half
an
hour
with
my
todger
hanging
out.
Even
so,
I
never
moved
a
muscle.
I
was
brilliant,
I
tell
you."
Langdon
cringed.

I
missed

moved
through
the
rectangular
annex
toward
the
archway
leading

the
furnishings
were
stark
and

the
traditional
ornamentation.
"Bleak,"
he
whispered.
Teabing
chuckled.

Nothing

Sophie
motioned
through
the
vast
opening
that
gave
way
to
the
circular
section
of
the
church.
"It
looks
like
a
fortress
in
there,"
she
whispered.
Langdon
agreed.
Even
from
here,
the
walls
looked
unusually
robust.
"The
Knights
Templar
were
warriors,"
Teabing
reminded,
the
sound
of
his
aluminum
crutches
echoing
in
this
reverberant
space.
"A
