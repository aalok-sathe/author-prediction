condone
assassination.
Regardless
of
the
stakes.
Sophie
seemed
to
be
having
similar
thoughts.
"Isn't
it
possible
that
these
Priory
members
were
murdered
by
someone
outside
the
Church?
Someone
who
didn't
understand
what
the
Grail
really
is?
The
Cup
of
Christ,
after
all,
would
be
quite
an
enticing
treasure.
Certainly
treasure
hunters
have
killed
for
less."
"In
my
experience,"
Teabing
said,
"men
go
to
far
greater
lengths
to
avoid
what
they
fear
than
to
obtain
what
they
desire.
I
sense
a
desperation
in
this
assault
on
the
Priory."
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
"the
argument
is
paradoxical.
Why
would
members
of
the
Catholic
clergy
murder
Priory
members
in
an
effort
to
find
and
destroy
documents
they
believe
are
false
testimony
anyway?"
Teabing
chuckled.
"The
ivory
towers
of
Harvard
have
made
you
soft,
Robert.
Yes,
the
clergy
in
Rome
are
blessed
with
potent
faith,
and
because
of
this,
their
beliefs
can
weather
any
storm,
including
documents
that
contradict
everything
they
hold
dear.
But
what
about
the
rest
of
the
world?
What
about
those
who
are
not
blessed
with
absolute
certainty?
What
about
those
who
look
at
the
cruelty
in
the
world
and
say,
where
is
God
today?
Those
who
look
at
Church
scandals
and
