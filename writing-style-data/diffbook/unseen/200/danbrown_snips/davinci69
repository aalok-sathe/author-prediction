Jacques
Sauniere,
Fache
had
said.
You
know
what
to
do.
No
mistakes
tonight.
And
so
far,
no
mistakes
had
been
made.
Collet
was
not
yet
privy
to
the
evidence
that
had
cemented
Fache's
certainty
of
their
suspect's
guilt,
but
he
knew
better
than
to
question
the
instincts
of
the
Bull.
Fache's
intuition
seemed
almost
supernatural
at
times.
God
whispers
in
his
ear,
one
agent
had
insisted
after
a
particularly
impressive
display
of
Fache's
sixth
sense.
Collet
had
to
admit,
if
there
was
a
God,
Bezu
Fache
would
be
on
His
A
list.
The
captain
attended
mass
and
confession
with
zealous
regularity
far
more
than
the
requisite
holiday
attendance
fulfilled
by
other
officials
in
the
name
of
good
public
relations.
When
the
Pope
visited
Paris
a
few
years
back,
Fache
had
used
all
his
muscle
to
obtain
the
honor
of
an
audience.
A
photo
of
Fache
with
the
Pope
now
hung
in
his
office.
The
Papal
Bull,
the
agents
secretly
called
it.
Collet
found
it
ironic
that
one
of
Fache's
rare
popular
public
stances
in
recent
years
had
been
his
outspoken
reaction
to
the
Catholic
pedophilia
scandal.
These
priests
should
be
hanged
twice!
Fache
had
declared.
Once
for
their
crimes
against
