in
the
direction
they
had
come
from.
"The
rest
rooms
are
back
toward
the
curator's
office."
Langdon
hesitated,
pointing
in
the
other
direction
toward
the
far
end
of
the
Grand
Gallery
corridor.
"I
believe
there's
a
much
closer
rest
room
at
the
end."
Fache
realized
Langdon
was
right.
They
were
two
thirds
of
the
way
down,
and
the
Grand
Gallery
dead
ended
at
a
pair
of
rest
rooms.
"Shall
I
accompany
you?"
Langdon
shook
his
head,
already
moving
deeper
into
the
gallery.
"Not
necessary.
I
think
I'd
like
a
few
minutes
alone."
Fache
was
not
wild
about
the
idea
of
Langdon
wandering
alone
down
the
remaining
length
of
corridor,
but
he
took
comfort
in
knowing
the
Grand
Gallery
was
a
dead
end
whose
only
exit
was
at
the
other
end
the
gate
under
which
they
had
entered.
Although
French
fire
regulations
required
several
emergency
stairwells
for
a
space
this
large,
those
stairwells
had
been
sealed
automatically
when
Sauniere
tripped
the
security
system.
Granted,
that
system
had
now
been
reset,
unlocking
the
stairwells,
but
it
didn't
matter
the
external
doors,
if
opened,
would
set
off
fire
alarms
and
were
guarded
outside
by
DCPJ
agents.
Langdon
could
not
possibly
leave
without
Fache
