happy
birthday

Sadly,
she
trudged
up
to
bed
that
night.
As
she
climbed
in,
though,
she
found
a
note
card
lying
on
her
pillow.
On
the
card
was
written
a
simple
riddle.
Even
before
she
solved
the
riddle,
she
was
smiling.
know
what
this
is!
Her
grandfather
had
done
this
for
her
last
Christmas
morning.
A
treasure
hunt!
Eagerly,
she
pored
over
the
riddle
until
she
solved

in

might

this

grandfather

her
to
