the
book
that
arguably
could
be
called
the
most
blood
soaked
publication
in
human
history.
Malleus
Maleficarum
or
The
Witches'
Hammer
indoctrinated
the
world
to
"the
dangers
of
freethinking
women"
and
instructed
the
clergy
how
to
locate,
torture,
and
destroy
them.
Those
deemed
"witches"
by
the
Church
included
all
female
scholars,
priestesses,
gypsies,
mystics,
nature
lovers,
herb
gatherers,
and
any
women
"suspiciously
attuned
to
the
natural
world.
"
Midwives
also
were
killed
for
their
heretical
practice
of
using
medical
knowledge
to
ease
the
pain
of
childbirth
a
suffering,
the
Church
claimed,
that
was
God's
rightful
punishment
for
Eve's
partaking
of
the
Apple
of
Knowledge,
thus
giving
birth
to
the
idea
of
Original
Sin.
During
three
hundred
years
of
witch
hunts,
the
Church
burned
at
the
stake
an
astounding
five
million
women.
The
propaganda
and
bloodshed
had
worked.
Today's
world
was
living
proof.
Women,
once
celebrated
as
an
essential
half
of
spiritual
enlightenment,
had
been
banished
from
the
temples
of
the
world.
There
were
no
female
Orthodox
rabbis,
Catholic
priests,
nor
Islamic
clerics.
The
once
hallowed
act
of
Hieros
Gamos
the
natural
sexual
union
between
man
and
woman
through
which
each
became
spiritually
whole
had
been
recast
as
a
shameful
act.
