"My
name
is
"Robert
Langdon."
She
gave
a
pleasant
smile.
"I
know
who
you
are."
For
an
instant,
he
feared
Fache
had
put
him
on
English
television
as
well,
but
the
librarian's
smile
suggested
otherwise.
Langdon
still
had
not
gotten
used
to
these
moments
of
unexpected
celebrity.
Then
again,
if
anyone
on
earth
were
going
to
recognize
his
face,
it
would
be
a
librarian
in
a
Religious
Studies
reference
facility.
"Pamela
Gettum,"
the
librarian
said,
offering
her
hand.
She
had
a
genial,
erudite
face
and
a
pleasingly
fluid
voice.
The
horn
rimmed
glasses
hanging
around
her
neck
were
thick.
"A

Langdon
said.
"This
is
my
friend
Sophie
Neveu."
The
two
women
greeted
one
another,
and
Gettum
turned
immediately

Langdon.
"I
didn't
know

were
coming."
"Neither
did
we.
If
it's
not
too
much
trouble,
we
could
really
use
your
help
finding
some
information."
Gettum
shifted,
looking
uncertain.
"Normally
our
services
are
by
petition
and
appointment
only,
unless
of
course
you're
the
guest
of
someone
at
the
college?"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"I'm
afraid
we've
come
unannounced.
A
friend
of
mine
speaks
very
highly
of
you.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing?"
Langdon
felt
a
pang
of
gloom
as
he
said
