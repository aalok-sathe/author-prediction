surprising
we
feel
conflicted
about
sex?"
he
asked
his
students.
"Our
ancient
heritage
and
our
very
physiologies
tell
us
sex
is
natural
a
cherished
route
to
spiritual
fulfillment
and
yet
modern
religion
decries
it
as
shameful,
teaching
us
to
fear
our
sexual
desire
as
the
hand
of
the
devil."

but
the
basic
gist
was
there
a
secret
society
communing
to
celebrate
the
magic
of
sexual
union.
"Professor
Langdon?"
A
male
student
in
back
raised
his
hand,
sounding
hopeful.
"Are
you
saying
that
instead
of
going
to
chapel,
we
should
have
more
sex?"
Langdon
chuckled,
not
about
to
take
the
bait.
From
what
he'd
heard
about
Harvard
parties,
these
kids
were
having
more

sex.
"Gentlemen,"
