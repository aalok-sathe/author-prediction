Tonight,
her
best
guess
was
that
Robert
Langdon,
whether
he
knew
it
or
not,
possessed
information
that
she
desperately
needed.
Princesse
Sophie,
Find
Robert
Langdon.
How
much
clearer
could
her
grandfather's
message
be?
Sophie
needed
more
time
with
Langdon.
Time
to
think.
Time
to
sort
out
this
mystery
together.
Unfortunately,
time
was
running
out.
Gazing
up
at
Langdon,
Sophie
made
the
only
play
she
could
think
of.
"Bezu
Fache
will
be
taking
you
into
custody
at
any
minute.
I
can
get
you
out
of
this
museum.
But
we
need
to
act
now."
Langdon's
eyes
went
wide.
"You
want
me
to
run?"
"It's
the
smartest
thing
you
could
do.
If
you
let
Fache
take
you
into
custody
now,
you'll
spend
weeks
in
a
French
jail
while
DCPJ
and
the
U.S.
Embassy
fight
over
which
courts
try
your
case.
But
if
we
get
you
out
of
here,
and
make
it
to
your
embassy,
then
your
government
will
protect
your
rights
while
you
and
I
prove
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
murder.
Langdon
looked
not
even
vaguely
convinced.
"Forget
it!
Fache
has
armed
guards
on
every
single
exit!
Even
if
we
escape
without
being
shot,
running
away
only
makes
me
look
