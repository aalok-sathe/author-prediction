One
night
the
ghost
awoke
to
the
screams
of
other
inmates.
He
didn't
know
what
invisible
force
was
shaking
the
floor
on
which
he
slept,
nor
what
mighty
hand
was
trembling
the
mortar
of
his
stone
cell,
but
as
he
jumped
to

a
large
boulder
toppled
onto
the

the
ghost

scrambling
through
a
narrow

down
a
barren
mountainside
into
the
woods.
He
ran
all
night,
always
downward,
delirious
with
hunger
and
exhaustion.
Skirting
the
edges
of
consciousness,
he
found
himself
at
dawn
in
a
clearing
where
train
tracks
cut
a
swath
across
the
forest.
Following
the
rails,
he
moved
on
as
if
dreaming.
Seeing
an
empty
freight
car,
he
crawled
in
for
shelter
and
rest.
