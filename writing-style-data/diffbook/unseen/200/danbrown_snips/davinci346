antiques
she
was
supposed
to
sit
on
the
Renaissance
velvet
divan,
the
rustic
eagle
claw
rocker,
or
the
pair
of
stone
pews
that
looked
like
they'd
been
lifted
from
some
Byzantine
temple.
Langdon
unwrapped
the
cryptex
from
his
coat,
walked
to
the
velvet
divan,
and
slid
the
wooden
box
deep
underneath
it,
well
out
of
sight.
Then,
shaking
out
his
jacket,
he
put
it
back
on,
smoothed
the
lapels,
and
smiled
at
Sophie
as
he
sat
down
directly
over
the
stashed
treasure.
The
divan
it
is,
Sophie
thought,
taking
a
seat
beside
him.
As
she
stared
into
the
growing
fire,
enjoying
the
warmth,
Sophie
had
the
sensation
that
her
grandfather
would
have
loved
this
room.
The
dark
wood
paneling
was
bedecked
with
Old
Master
paintings,
one
of
which
Sophie
recognized
as
a
Poussin,
her
grandfather's
second
favorite
painter.
On
the
mantel
above
the
fireplace,
an
alabaster
bust
of
Isis
watched
over
the
room.
Beneath
the
Egyptian
goddess,
inside
the
fireplace,
two
stone
gargoyles
served
as
andirons,
their
mouths
gaping
to
reveal
their
menacing
hollow
throats.
Gargoyles
had
always
terrified
Sophie
as
a
child;
that
was,
until
her
grandfather
cured
her
of
the
fear
by
taking
her
atop
Notre
Dame
