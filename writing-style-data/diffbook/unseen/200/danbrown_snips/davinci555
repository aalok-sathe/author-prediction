He
glanced
up,
chuckling.
"Peanut
allergy."
Collet
nodded,
recalling
a
police
investigation
into
a
restaurant
that
had
failed
to
notate
on
its
menu
that
the
chili
recipe
contained
peanut
oil.
An
unsuspecting
patron
had
died
of
anaphylactic
shock
at
the
table
after
a

space,
the

of
the

where
a
wooden
ladder
now
ascended
high
into
the
rafters,
propped
against
the
ledge
of
a
hayloft
suspended
high
above
them.
"That
ladder

Collet
said.
"No,
