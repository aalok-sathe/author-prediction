window
to
his
right,
he
could
see
Montmartre
and
the
beautiful
dome
of
Sacre
Coeur.
The
image
was
interrupted
by
the
flash
of
police
lights
sailing
past
them
in
the
opposite
direction.
Langdon
and
Sophie
ducked
down
as
the
sirens
faded.
Sophie
had
told
the
cab
driver
simply
to
head
out
of
the
city,
and
from
her
firmly
set
jaw,
Langdon
sensed
she
was
trying
to
figure
out
their
next
move.
Langdon
examined
the
cruciform
key
again,
holding
it
to
the
window,
bringing
it
close
to
his
eyes
in
an
effort
to
find
any
markings
on
it
that
might
indicate
where
the
key
had
been
made.
In
the
intermittent
glow
of
passing
streetlights,
he
saw
no
markings
except
the
Priory
seal.
"It
doesn't
make
sense,"
he
finally
said.
"Which
part?"
"That
your
grandfather
would
go
to
so
much
trouble
to
give
you
a
key
that
you
wouldn't
know
what
to
do
with."
"I
agree."
"Are
you
sure
he
didn't
write
anything
else
on
the
back
of
the
painting?"
"I
searched
the
whole
area.
This
is
all
there
was.
This
key,
wedged
behind
the
painting.
I
saw
the
Priory
seal,
stuck
the
key
in
my
pocket,
then
we
left."
Langdon
frowned,
