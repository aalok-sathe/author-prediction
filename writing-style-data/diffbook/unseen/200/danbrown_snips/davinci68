Fache
frowned
as
if
the
idea
had
never
occurred
to
him.
"You
have
a
point."
"Considering
the
circumstances,"
Langdon
said,
"I
would
assume
that
if
Sauniere
wanted
to
tell
you
who
killed
him,
he
would
have
written
down
somebody's
name.
As
Langdon
spoke
those
words,
a
smug
smile
crossed
Fache's
lips
for
the
first
time
all
night.
"Precisement,
"
Fache
said.
"Precisement.
I
am
witnessing
the
work
of
a
master,
mused
Lieutenant
Collet
as
he
tweaked
his
audio
gear
and
listened
to
Fache's
voice
coming
through
the
headphones.
The
agent

knew
it
was
moments
like
these
that
had
lifted
the
captain
to
the
pinnacle
of
French
law
enforcement.

do
what
no
one
else
dares.
The
delicate
art
of
cajoler
was
a
lost
skill
in
modern
law
enforcement,
one
that
required
exceptional
poise
under
pressure.
Few
men
possessed
the
necessary
sangfroid
for
this
kind
of
operation,
but
Fache
seemed
born
for
it.
His
restraint
and
patience
bordered
on
the
robotic.
Fache's
sole
emotion
this
evening
seemed
to
be
one
of
intense
resolve,
as
if
this
arrest
were
somehow
personal
to
him.
Fache's
briefing
of
his
agents
an
hour
ago
had
been
unusually
succinct
and
assured.
