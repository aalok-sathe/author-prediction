a
fuss.
"C'est
ennuyeux,
"
Sophie
grumbled.
"Boring,"
he
corrected.
"French
at
school.
English
at
home."
"Le
Louvre,
c'est
pas
chez
moil"
she
challenged.
He
gave
her
a
tired
laugh.
"Right
you
are.
Then
let's
speak
English
just
for
fun."
Sophie
pouted
and
kept
walking.
As
they
entered
the
Salle
des
Etats,
her
eyes
scanned
the
narrow
room
and
settled
on
the
obvious
spot
of
honor
the
center
of
the
right
hand
wall,
where
a
lone
portrait
hung
behind
a
protective
Plexiglas
wall.
Her
grandfather
paused
in
the
doorway
and
motioned
toward
the
painting.
"Go
ahead,
Sophie.
Not
many
people
get
a
chance
to
visit
her
alone."
Swallowing
her
apprehension,
Sophie
moved
slowly
across
the
room.
After
everything
she'd
heard
about
the
Mona
Lisa,
she
felt
as
if
she
were
approaching
royalty.
Arriving
in
front
of
the
protective
Plexiglas,
Sophie
held
her
breath
and
looked
up,
taking
it
in
all
at
once.
Sophie
was
not
sure
what
she
had
expected
to
feel,
but
it
most
certainly
was
not
this.
No
jolt
of
amazement.
No
instant
of
wonder.
The
famous
face
looked
as
it
did
in
books.
She
stood
in
silence
for
what
felt
like
forever,
waiting
for
something
to
happen.
