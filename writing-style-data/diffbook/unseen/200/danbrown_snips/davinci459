text,
he
quivered
with
excitement,
leaning
in,
trying
to
see
around
Langdon,
who
was
still
hunched
over
the
box.
"I
don't
know,"
Langdon
whispered
intently.
"My
first
guess
is
a
Semitic,
but
now
I'm
not
so
sure.
Most
primary
Semitics
include
nekkudot.
This
has
none."
"Probably
ancient,"
Teabing
offered.
"Nekkudot?"
Sophie
inquired.
Teabing
never
took
his
eyes
from
the
box.
"Most
modern
Semitic
alphabets
have
no
vowels
and
use
nekkudot
tiny
dots
and
dashes
written
either
below
or
within
the
consonants
to
indicate
what
vowel
sound
accompanies
them.
Historically
speaking,
nekkudot
are
a
relatively
modern
addition
to
language."
Langdon
was
still
hovering
over
the
script.
"A
Sephardic
transliteration,
perhaps?"
Teabing
could
bear
it
no
longer.
"Perhaps
if
I
just"
Reaching
over,
he
edged
the
box
away
from
Langdon
and
pulled
it
toward
himself.
No
doubt
Langdon
had
a
solid
familiarity
with
the
standard
ancients
Greek,
Latin,
the
Romances
but
from
the
fleeting
glance
Teabing
had
of
this
language,
he
thought
it
looked
more
specialized,
possibly
a
Rashi
script
or
a
STA'M
with
crowns.
Taking
a
deep
breath,
Teabing
feasted
his
eyes
upon
the
engraving.
He
said
nothing
for
a
very
long
time.
With
each
passing
second,
Teabing
felt
