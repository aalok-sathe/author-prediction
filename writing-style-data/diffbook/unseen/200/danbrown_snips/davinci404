the
doors,
and
demanded
his
guests
leave.
Then
the
woman
mentioned
the
keystone,
and
everything
changed.
Shouts
turned
to
whispers.
Moods
softened.
And
the
glass
doors
were
quickly
closed.
Now,
as
he
huddled
in
the
shadows,
Silas
peered
through
the
glass.
The
keystone
is
somewhere
inside
the
house.
Silas
could
feel
it.
Staying
in
the
shadows,
he
inched
closer
to
the
glass,
eager
to
hear
what
was
being
said.
He
would
give
them
five
minutes.
If
they
did
not
reveal
where
they
had
placed
the
keystone,
Silas
would
have
to
enter
and
persuade
them
with
force.
Inside
the
study,
Langdon
could
sense
their
host's
bewilderment.
"Grand
Master?"
Teabing
choked,
eyeing
Sophie.
"Jacques
Sauniere?"
Sophie
nodded,
seeing
the
shock
in
his
eyes.
"But
you
could
not
possibly
know
that!"
"Jacques
Sauniere
was
my
grandfather."
Teabing
staggered
back
on
his
crutches,
shooting
a
glance
at
Langdon,
who
nodded.
Teabing
turned
back
to
Sophie.
"Miss
Neveu,
I
am
speechless.
If
this
is
true,
then
I
am
truly
sorry
for
your
loss.
I
should
admit,
for
my
research,
I
have
kept
lists
of
men
in
Paris
whom
I
thought
might
be
good
candidates
for
involvement
in
the
Priory.
Jacques
Sauniere
was
on
that
list
