"Wrong
Pope,"
Langdon
said,
disappointed.
Even
so,
he
was
amazed
by
the
system's
ease
of
use.
The
keywords
with
context
were
enough
to
remind
him
that
Wagner's
opera
Parsifal
was
a
tribute
to
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
bloodline
of
Jesus
Christ,
told
through
the
story
of
a
young
knight
on
a
quest
for
truth.

the

returned
several
more

references,
including
a
text
about
troubadours
France's
famous
wandering
minstrels.
Langdon
knew
it
was
no
coincidence
that
the
word
minstrel
and
minister
shared
an
etymological
root.
The
troubadours
were
the
traveling
servants
or
"ministers"
of
the
Church
of
Mary
Magdalene,
using
music
to
disseminate
the
story
of
the
sacred
feminine
among
the
common
folk.
To
this
day,
the
troubadours
sang
songs
extolling
the
virtues
of
"our
Lady"
a
mysterious
and
beautiful
woman
to
whom
they
pledged
themselves
forever.
Eagerly,
he
checked
the
hypertext
but
found
nothing.
The
computer
pinged
again.
