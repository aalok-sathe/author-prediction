night
had
been
the
darkest
night
of
his
life.
Despondently,
he
thought
of
Silas,
whose
body
had
been
found
in
the
park.
Please
forgive
me,
my
son.
Aringarosa
had
longed
for
Silas
to
be
part
of
his
glorious
plan.
Last
night,
however,
Aringarosa
had
received
a
call
from
Bezu
Fache,
questioning
the
bishop
about
his
apparent
connection
to
a
nun
who
had
been
murdered
in
Saint

realized
the
evening
had

the
horrific
chain

events

confess
everything

Aringarosa
and
Fache
had
been
racing
to
catch
up
with
Silas
before
the
Teacher
persuaded
him
to
kill
again.
Feeling
bone
weary,
Aringarosa
closed
his
eyes
and
listened
to
the
television
coverage
of
the
arrest
of
a
prominent
British
knight,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing.
The
Teacher
laid
bare
for
all
to
see.
Teabing
had
caught
wind
of
the
Vatican's
plans
to
disassociate
itself
from
Opus
Dei.
He
