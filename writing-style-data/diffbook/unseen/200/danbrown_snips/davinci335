story,
then
describing
how
years
of
research
had
persuaded
him
that
the
story
was
true.
Finally,
Langdon
offered
some
of
his
own
research
a
series
of
symbologic
connections
that
strongly
supported
the
seemingly
controversial
claims.
When
the
program
aired
in
Britain,
despite
its
ensemble
cast
and
well
documented
evidence,
the
premise
rubbed
so
hard
against
the
grain
of
popular
Christian
thought
that
it
instantly
confronted
a
firestorm

hostility.
It

aired
in

States,
but
the
repercussions

Shortly

landmark.
He'll
be
in
no

to
cooperate
with
Fache."
Sophie
stared
out
at
the
dark
roadway.
"If
we
go
to
him,
how
much
do
you
want
to
tell
him?"
Langdon
looked
unconcerned.
"Believe
me,
Leigh
Teabing
knows
more
about
the
Priory

the
Holy

earth.
Sophie

him.
