a
young
Jesuit
priest
hurried
out
and
greeted
him.
"Bishop,
welcome.
I
am
Father
Mangano.
An
astronomer
here."
Good
for
you.
Aringarosa
grumbled
his
hello
and
followed
his
host
into
the
castle's
foyer
a
wide
open
space
whose
decor
was
a
graceless
blend
of
Renaissance
art
and
astronomy
images.
Following
his
escort
up
the
wide
travertine
marble
staircase,
Aringarosa
saw
signs
for
conference
centers,
science
lecture
halls,
and
tourist
information
services.
It
amazed
him
to
think
the
Vatican
was
failing
at
every
turn
to
provide
coherent,
stringent
guidelines
for
spiritual
growth
and
yet
somehow
still
found
time
to
give
astrophysics
lectures
to
tourists.
"Tell
me,"
Aringarosa
said
to
the
young
priest,
"when
did
the
tail
start
wagging
the
dog?"
The
priest
gave
him
an
odd
look.
"Sir?"
Aringarosa
waved
it
off,
deciding
not
to
launch
into
that
particular
offensive
again
this
evening.
The
Vatican
has
gone
mad.
Like
a
lazy
parent
who
found
it
easier
to
acquiesce
to
the
whims
of
a
spoiled
child
than
to
stand
firm
and
teach
values,
the
Church
just
kept
softening
at
every
turn,
trying
to
reinvent
itself
to
accommodate
a
culture
gone
astray.
The
top
floor's
corridor
was
wide,
lushly
appointed,
and
led
in
