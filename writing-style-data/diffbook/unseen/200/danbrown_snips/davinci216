sealed
off
Avenue
Gabriel!
Langdon
gave
a
grim
sigh.
"I
take
it
the
embassy
is
off
limits
this
evening?"
Down
the
street,
the
two
DCPJ
officers
who
stood
beside
their
cars
were
now
staring
in
their
direction,
apparently
curious
about
the
headlights
that
had
halted
so
abruptly
up
the
street
from
them.
Okay,
Sophie,
turn
around
very
slowly.
Putting
the
SmartCar
in

seat,
twisted
backward,
scanning
behind
them
for
any
signs
of
the
police.
He
suddenly
wished
he
had
not
decided
to
run.
You
didn't,
he
reminded
himself.
Sophie
had
made
the
decision
for
him
when
she
threw
the
GPS
dot
out
the
bathroom
window.
Now,
as

sped

from
the
embassy,
serpentining

sparse
traffic

Langdon
felt
