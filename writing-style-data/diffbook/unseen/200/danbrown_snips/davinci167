the
walkway.
When
Sophie
steered
out
over
the
thick
lawn
and
lost
her
balance,
they
both
went
tumbling
onto
the
grass,
rolling
and
laughing.
"Grand
pere,
"
Sophie
said,
hugging
him.
"I'm
really
sorry
about
the
key."
"I
know,
sweetie.
You're
forgiven.
I
can't
possibly
stay
mad
at
you.
Grandfathers
and
granddaughters
always
forgive
each
other.
Sophie
knew
she
shouldn't
ask,
but
she
couldn't
help
it.
"What
does
it
open?
I
never
saw
a
key
like
that.
It
was
very
pretty."
Her
grandfather
was
silent
a
long
moment,
and
Sophie
could
see
he
was
uncertain
how
to

Grand
pere
never
lies.
"It
opens
a
box,"
he
finally
said.
"Where
I
keep
many
secrets."
Sophie
pouted.
"I
hate
secrets!"
"I
know,
but
these
are
important
secrets.
And
someday,
you'll
learn
to
appreciate
them
as
much
as
I
do."
"I
saw
letters
on
the
key,
and
a
flower."
"Yes,
that's
my
favorite
flower.
It's
called
a
fleur
de
lis.
We
have
them
in
the
garden.
The
white
ones.
In
English
we
call
that
kind
of
flower
a
lily."
"I
know
those!
They're
my
favorite
too!"
"Then
I'll
make
a
deal
with
you."
Her
grandfather's
eyebrows
raised
the
way
they
always
did
