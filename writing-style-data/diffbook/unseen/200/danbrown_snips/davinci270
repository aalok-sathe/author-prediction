pleasure,
Langdon
thought,
sliding
the
pistol
under
the
seat.
Sophie
and
Langdon
got
out
and
walked
up
the
red
carpet
toward
the
slab
of
steel.
The
door
had
no
handle,
but
on
the
wall
beside
it
was
another
triangular
keyhole.
No
directions
were
posted
this
time.
"Keeps
out
the
slow
learners,"
Langdon
said.
Sophie
laughed,
looking
nervous.
"Here
we
go."
She
stuck
the
key
in
the
hole,
and
the
door
swung
inward
with

shut
with
a
thud
behind
them.
The
foyer

the
Depository
Bank

Zurich
employed
as

Who's
their
decorator?
Langdon
wondered.
Allied
Steel?
Sophie
looked
equally
intimidated
as
her
eyes
scanned
the
lobby.
The
gray
metal
was
everywhere
the
floor,
walls,
counters,
doors,
even
the
lobby
chairs
appeared
to
be
fashioned
of
molded
iron.
Nonetheless,
the
effect
was
impressive.
The
message
was
clear:
You
are
walking
into
a
vault.
A
large
man
behind
the
counter
glanced
up
as
they
entered.
He
turned
