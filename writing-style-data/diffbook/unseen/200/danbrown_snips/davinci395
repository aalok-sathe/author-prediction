d'Heristal.
Late
seventh
century.
With
Dagobert's
murder,
the
Merovingian
bloodline
was
almost
exterminated.
Fortunately,
Dagobert's
son,
Sigisbert,
secretly
escaped
the
attack
and
carried
on
the
lineage,
which
later
included

of
the
Priory
of
Sion."
"The
same
man,"
Langdon
said,
"who
ordered
the
Knights
Templar
to
recover
the
Sangreal

The
words

her
bones
were
reverberating
with
some
new
kind
of
truth.
Descendants
of
Jesus
who
survived
into
modern
times.
Her
grandfather's
voice
again
was
whispering
in
her
ear.
Princess,
I
must
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
family.
A
chill
raked
her
flesh.
Royal
