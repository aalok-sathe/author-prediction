"Who
is
your
teacher?"
Teabing
asked.
"Perhaps
we
can
make
a
financial
arrangement."
"The
Grail
is
priceless."
He
moved
closer.
"You're
bleeding,"
Teabing
noted
calmly,
nodding
to
the
monk's
right
ankle
where
a
trickle
of
blood
had
run
down
his
leg.
"And
you're

"As

at
Teabing's
head.
Sophie
watched,
feeling
helpless
as
the
