"might
I
offer
a
suggestion
for
all
of
you.
Without
being
so
bold
as
to
condone
premarital
sex,
and
without
being
so
naive
as
to
think
you're
all
chaste
angels,
I
will
give
you
this
bit
of
advice
about
your

All
the

in
the
audience

forward,
listening
intently.
"The
next
time
you
find
yourself
with
a
woman,
look
in
your
heart
and
see
if
you
cannot
approach
sex
as
a
mystical,
spiritual
act.
Challenge
yourself
to
find
that
spark
of
divinity
that
man
can
only
achieve
through
union
with
the
sacred
feminine."
The

She

Without

Sophie

Quietly.
Fearfully.
As
