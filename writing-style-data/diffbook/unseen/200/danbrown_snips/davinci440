England.
I
pay
for
certain
special
privileges
at
both
ends.
Once
we're
airborne,
you
can
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
you'd
like
someone
from
the
U.S.
Embassy
to
meet
us."
Langdon
suddenly
didn't
want
anything
to
do
with
the
embassy.
All
he
could
think
of
was
the
keystone,
the
inscription,
and
whether
it
would
all
lead
to
the
Grail.
He
wondered
if
Teabing
was
right
about
Britain.
Admittedly
most
modern
legends
placed
the
Grail
somewhere
in
the
United
Kingdom.
Even
King
Arthur's
mythical,
Grail
rich
Isle
of
Avalon
was
now
believed
to
be
none
other
than
Glastonbury,
England.
Wherever
the
Grail
lay,
Langdon
never
imagined
he
would
actually
be
looking
for
it.
The
Sangreal
documents.
The
true
history
of
Jesus
Christ.
The
tomb
of
Mary
Magdalene.
He
suddenly
felt
as
if
he
were
living
in
some
kind
of
limbo
tonight
a
bubble
where
the
real
world
could
not
reach
him.
"Sir?"
Remy
said.
"Are
you
truly
thinking
of
returning
to
England
for
good?"
"Remy,
you
needn't
worry,"
Teabing
assured.
"Just
because
I
am
returning
to
the
Queen's
realm
does
not
mean
I
intend
to
subject
my
palate
to
bangers
and
mash
for
the
rest
of
my
days.
