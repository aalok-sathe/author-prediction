inscribed
a
nude
male
his
arms
and
legs
outstretched
in
a
naked
spread
eagle.
Da
Vinci.
Langdon
felt
a
shiver
of
amazement.
The
clarity
of
Sauniere's
intentions
could
not
be
denied.
In
his
final
moments
of
life,
the
curator
had
stripped
off
his
clothing
and
arranged
his
body
in
a
clear
image
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci's
Vitruvian
Man.
The
circle
had
been
the
missing
critical
element.
A
feminine
symbol
of
protection,
the
circle
around
the
naked
man's
body
completed
Da
Vinci's
intended
message
male
and
female
harmony.
The
question
now,
though,
was
why
Sauniere
would
imitate
a
famous
drawing.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
Fache
said,
"certainly
a
man
like
yourself
is
aware
that
Leonardo
da
Vinci
had
a
tendency
toward
the
darker
arts."
Langdon
was
surprised
by
Fache's
knowledge
of
Da
Vinci,
and
it
certainly
went
a
long
way
toward
explaining
the
captain's
suspicions
about
devil
worship.
Da
Vinci
had
always
been
an
awkward
subject
for
historians,
especially
in
the
Christian
tradition.
Despite
the
visionary's
genius,
he
was
a
flamboyant
homosexual
and
worshipper
of
Nature's
divine
order,
both
of
which
placed
him
in
a
perpetual
state
of
sin
against
God.
Moreover,
the
artist's
eerie
eccentricities
projected
an
admittedly
demonic
aura:
