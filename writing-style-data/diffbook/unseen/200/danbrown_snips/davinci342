the
bank
had
demanded.
"How
can
I
help
you,
sir?"
"Armored
truck
number
three.
I
need
to
find
it."
Puzzled,
the
manager
checked
his
delivery
schedule.
"It's
here.
Downstairs
at
the
loading
dock."
"Actually,
no.
The
truck
was
stolen
by
the
two
individuals
the
police
are
tracking."
"What?
How
did
they
drive
out?"
"I
can't
go
into
the
specifics
on
the
phone,
but
we
have
a
situation
here
that
could
potentially
be
extremely
unfortunate
for
the
bank.
"What
do
you
need
me
to
do,
sir?"
"I'd
like
you
to
activate
the
truck's
emergency
transponder."
The
night
manager's
eyes
moved
to
the
LoJack
control
box
across
the
room.
Like
many
armored
cars,
each
of
the
bank's
trucks
had
been
equipped
with
a
radio
controlled
homing
device,
which
could
be
activated
remotely
from
the
bank.
The
manager
had
only
used
the
emergency
system
once,
after
a
hijacking,
and
it
had
worked
flawlessly
locating
the
truck
and
transmitting
the
coordinates
to
the
authorities
automatically.
Tonight,
however,
the
manager
had
the
impression
the
president
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
prudence.
"Sir,
you
are
aware
that
if
I
activate
the
LoJack
system,
the
transponder
will
simultaneously
inform
the
authorities
that
we
have
a
problem."
