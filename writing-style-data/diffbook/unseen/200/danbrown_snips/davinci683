recollection
crossed
her
face.
"Ah,
yes,
of
course.
The
blade
represents
all
that
is
masculine.
I
believe
it
is
drawn
like
this,
no?"
Using
her
index
finger,
she
traced
a
shape
on
her
palm.
A
"Yes,"
Langdon
said.
Marie
had
drawn
the
less
common
"closed"
form
of
the
blade,
although
Langdon
had
seen
the
symbol
portrayed
both
ways.
"And
the
inverse,"
she
said,
drawing
again
on
her
palm,
"is
the
chalice,
which
represents
the
feminine."
v
"Correct,"
Langdon
said.
"And
you
are
saying
that
in
all
the
hundreds
of
symbols
we
have
here
in
Rosslyn
Chapel,
these
two
shapes
appear
nowhere?"
"I
didn't
see
them."
"And
if
I
show
them
to
you,
will
you
get
some
sleep?"
Before
Langdon
could
answer,
Marie
Chauvel
had
stepped
off
the
porch
and
was
heading
toward
the
chapel.
Langdon
hurried
after
her.
Entering
the
ancient
building,
Marie
turned
on
the
lights
and
pointed
to
the
center
of
the
sanctuary
floor.
"There
you
are,
Mr.
Langdon.
The
blade
and
chalice."
Langdon
stared
at
the
scuffed
stone
floor.
It
was
blank.
"There's
nothing
here."
Marie
sighed
and
began
to
walk
along
the
famous
path
worn
into
the
chapel
floor,
the
same
path
Langdon
had
seen
