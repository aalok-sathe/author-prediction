skyward,
launching
the
cryptex
straight
up
toward
the
dome
above.
Leigh
Teabing
did
not
feel
his
finger
pull
the
trigger,
but
the
Medusa
discharged
with
a
thundering
crash.
Langdon's
crouched
form
was
now
vertical,
almost
airborne,
and
the
bullet
exploded
in
the
floor
near
Langdon's
feet.
Half
of
Teabing's
brain
attempted
to
adjust
his
aim
and
fire
again
in
rage,
but
the
more
powerful
half
dragged
his
eyes
upward
into
the
cupola.
The
keystone!
Time
seemed
to
freeze,
morphing
into
a
slow
motion
dream
as
Teabing's
entire
world
became
the
airborne
keystone.
He
watched
it
rise
to
the
apex
of
its
climb
hovering
for
a
moment
in
the
void
and
then
tumbling
downward,
end
over
end,
back
toward
the
stone
floor.
All
of
Teabing's
hopes
and
dreams
were
plummeting
toward
earth.
It
cannot
strike
the
floor!
I
can
reach
it!
Teabing's
body
reacted
on
instinct.
He
released
the
gun
and
heaved
himself
forward,
dropping
his
crutches
as
he
reached
out
with
his
soft,
manicured
hands.
Stretching
his
arms
and
fingers,
he
snatched
the
keystone
from
midair.
Falling
forward
with
the
keystone
victoriously
clutched
in
his
hand,
Teabing
knew
he
was
falling
too
fast.
With
nothing
to
break
his
fall,
his
