man
I
spoke
to
said
he
forced
their
car
off
the
road
into
a
river.
Sauniere
fell
silent.
"Monsieur
Sauniere,
I
would
never
have
phoned
you
directly
except
this
man
made
a
comment
which
makes
me
now
fear
for
your
safety."
He
paused.
"The
man
also
mentioned
your
granddaughter,
Sophie."
The
mention
of
Sophie's
name
had
been
the
catalyst.
The
curator
leapt
into
action.
He
ordered
Silas
to
come
see
him
immediately
in
the
safest
location
Sauniere
knew
his
Louvre
office.
Then
he
phoned
Sophie
to
warn
her
she
might
be
in
danger.
Drinks
with
Robert
Langdon
were
instantly
abandoned.
Now,
with
Langdon
separated
from
Sophie
on
the
far
side
of
the
room,
Teabing
sensed

had
successfully
alienated
the
two
companions
from
one
another.
Sophie
Neveu
remained
defiant,
but
Langdon
clearly
saw
the
larger
picture.
He
was
trying
to
figure
out
the
password.
He
understands
the
importance
of
finding
the
Grail
and
releasing
her
from
bondage.
"He
won't
open
it
for
you,"
Sophie
said
coldly.
"Even
if
he
can."
Teabing
was
glancing
at
Langdon
as
he
held
the
gun
on
Sophie.
He
was
fairly
certain
now
he
was
going
to
have
to
use
the
weapon.
Although
the
idea
troubled
