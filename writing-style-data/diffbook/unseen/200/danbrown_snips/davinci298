Still,
he
could
not
justify
removing
the
strap.
have
failed
the
Church.
Far
worse,
I
have
failed
the
bishop.
Tonight
was
supposed
to
be
Bishop
Aringarosa's
salvation.
Five
months
ago,
the
bishop
had
returned
from
a
meeting
at
the
Vatican
Observatory,
where
he
had
learned
something
that
left
him
deeply
changed.
Depressed
for
weeks,
Aringarosa
had
finally
shared
the
news
with
Silas.
"But
this
is
impossible!"
Silas
had
cried
out.
"I
cannot
accept
it!"
"It
is
true,"
Aringarosa
said.
"Unthinkable,
but
true.
In
only
six
months."
The
bishop's
words
terrified
Silas.
He
prayed
for
deliverance,
and
even
in
those
dark
days,
his
trust
in
God
and
The
Way
never
wavered.
It
was
only
a
month
later
that
the
clouds
parted
miraculously
and
the
light
of
possibility
shone
through.
Divine
intervention,
Aringarosa
had
called
it.
The
bishop
had
seemed
hopeful
for
the
first
time.
"Silas,"
he
whispered,
"God
has
bestowed
upon
us
an
opportunity
to
protect
The
Way.
Our
battle,
like
all
battles,
will
take
sacrifice.
Will
you
be
a
soldier
of
God?"
Silas
fell
to
his
knees
before
Bishop
Aringarosa
the
man
who
had
given
him
a
new
life
and
he
said,
"I
am
a
lamb
of
God.
