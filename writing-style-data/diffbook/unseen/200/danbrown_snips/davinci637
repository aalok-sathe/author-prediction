doors
of
St.
Mary's
Hospital
hissed
open.
Silas
lurched
into
the
entryway
delirious
with
exhaustion.
Dropping
to
his
knees
on
the
tile
floor,
he
cried
out
for
help.
Everyone
in
the
reception
area
gaped
in
wonderment
at
the
half
naked
albino
offering
forth
a
bleeding
clergyman.
The
doctor
who
helped
Silas
heave
the
delirious
bishop
onto
a
gurney
looked
gloomy
as
he
felt
Aringarosa's
pulse.
"He's
lost
a
lot
of
blood.
I
am
not
hopeful."
Aringarosa's
eyes
flickered,
and
he
returned
for
a
moment,
his
gaze
locating
Silas.
"My
child"
Silas's
soul
thundered
with
remorse
and
rage.
"Father,
if
it
takes
my
lifetime,
I
will
find
the
one
who
deceived
us,
and
I
will
kill
him."
Aringarosa
shook
his
head,
looking
sad
as
they
prepared
to
wheel
him
away.
"Silas
if
you
have
learned
nothing
from
me,
please
learn
this."
He
took
Silas's
hand
and
gave
it
a
firm
squeeze.
"Forgiveness
is
God's
greatest
gift."
"But
Father"
Aringarosa
closed
his
eyes.
"Silas,
you
must
pray."
Robert
Langdon
stood
beneath
the
lofty
cupola
of
the
deserted
Chapter
House
and
stared
into
the
barrel
of
Leigh
Teabing's
gun.
Robert,
are
you
with
me,
or
against
me?
The
Royal
Historian's
words
echoed
in
