back
to
the
bookshelf,
"is
that
all
of
these
books
substantiate
the
same
historical
claim."
"That
Jesus
was
a
father."
Sophie
was
still
uncertain.
"Yes,"
Teabing
said.
"And
that
Mary
Magdalene
was
the
womb
that
carried
His
royal
lineage.
The
Priory
of
Sion,
to
this
day,
still
worships
Mary
Magdalene
as
the
Goddess,
the
Holy
Grail,
the
Rose,
and
the
Divine
Mother."
Sophie
again
flashed
on
the
ritual
in
the
basement.
"According
to
the
Priory,"
Teabing
continued,
"Mary

was
pregnant
at

For
the
safety
of
Christ's

she

the
help
of
Jesus'
trusted
uncle,
Joseph
of
Arimathea,
Mary

secretly
traveled
to
France,
then
known
as
Gaul.
There
she
found
safe
refuge
in
the
Jewish
community.
It
was
here
in
France
that
she
gave
birth
to
a
daughter.
Her
name
was
Sarah."
Sophie
glanced
up.
"They
actually
know
the
child's
name?"
"Far
more
than
that.
Magdalene's
and
Sarah's
lives
were
scrutinously
chronicled
by
their
Jewish
protectors.
Remember
that
Magdalene's
child
belonged
to
the
lineage
of
Jewish
kings
David
and
Solomon.
For
this
reason,
the
Jews
in
France
considered
Magdalene
