I'm
with
eight
men
total.
Four
of
us
have
field
rifles
and
the
others
have
sidearms."
"Wait
for
me."
"Captain,
what
if
Langdon
has
a
hostage
in
there?
What
if
he
sees
us
and
decides
to
leave
on

We

time.
Collet's
job
was
simply
to
hold
down
the
fort
until
the
boss
showed
up
to
save
the
day.
As
he
stood
there,
Collet
flashed
on
a
second
possible
explanation
for
this
delay.
Damage
control.
In
law
enforcement,
hesitating
to
arrest
a
fugitive
only
occurred
