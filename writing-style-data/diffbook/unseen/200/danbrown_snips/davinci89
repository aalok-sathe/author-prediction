immediately."
She
pulled
a
scrap
of
paper
from
her
sweater
pocket
and
handed
it
to
Fache.
"Here
is
the
decryption."
Fache
looked
at
the
card.

"This
is
it?"
he
snapped.
"All
you
did
was
put
the
numbers
in
increasing
order!"
Sophie

her

"the
sequence
of
numbers

have
in
your
hand
happens
to
be
one
of
the
most
famous
mathematical
progressions
in
history."
Fache
was
not
aware
there
even
existed
a
mathematical
progression
that
qualified
as
famous,
and
he
certainly
didn't
appreciate
Sophie's
off

tone.
"This
is
the
Fibonacci
sequence,"
she
declared,
nodding

Fache's
hand.
"A
