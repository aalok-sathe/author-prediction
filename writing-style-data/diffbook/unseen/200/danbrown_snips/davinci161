grave.
The
Mona
Lisa.
She
reached
for
the
huge
wooden
doors,
and
pushed.
The
entryway
yawned
open.
Sophie
stood
on
the
threshold
a
moment,
scanning
the
large
rectangular
chamber
beyond.
It
too
was
bathed
in
a
soft
red
light.
The
Salle
des
Etats
was
one
of
this

surrounded
by
electronic
gear.

had
written
anything
in
here,
he
almost

would
have
written

with
the

Taking
a
deep

Sophie
hurried
down
to
the
well
lit
crime
scene.
Unable
to
look
at
her
grandfather,
she
focused
solely
on
the

Finding

she
