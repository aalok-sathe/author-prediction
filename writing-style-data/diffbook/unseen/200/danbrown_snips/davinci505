but
they
were
obviously
serious.
At
the
French
authorities'
request,
Kent
police
had
ordered
the
Biggin
Hill
air
traffic
controller
to
radio
the
Hawker's
pilot
and
order
him
directly
to
the
terminal
rather
than
to
the
client's
hangar.
The
pilot
had
agreed,
apparently
believing
the
far
fetched
story
of
a
gas
leak.
Though
the
British
police
did
not
generally
carry
weapons,
the
gravity
of
the
situation
had
brought
out
an
armed
response
team.
Now,
eight
policemen
with
handguns
stood
just
inside
the
terminal
building,
awaiting
the

when
the
plane's
engines
powered

the
plane
could

Then
the
police
would
step
into
view
and
hold
the
occupants
at
bay
until
the
French
police
arrived
to
handle
the
situation.
The
Hawker
was
low
in
the
sky
now,
skimming
the
treetops
to
their
right.
Simon
Edwards
went
downstairs
to
watch
the
landing
from
tarmac
level.
The
Kent
police
were
poised,
just
out
of
sight,
and
the
maintenance
man
waited
with
his
wedges.
Out
on
the
runway,
the
Hawker's
nose
tipped
up,
and
the
tires
touched
down
in
a
puff
of
smoke.
The
plane
settled
