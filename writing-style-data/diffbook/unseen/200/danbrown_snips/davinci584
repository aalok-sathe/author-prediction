the
real
reason
he
had
told
Remy
to
come
to
this
spot.
As
the
Teacher
approached
the
front
passenger
door
of
the
parked
limousine,
Remy
leaned
across
and
opened
the
door.
The
Teacher
paused
outside,
taking
a
pull
from
the
flask
of
cognac
he
was
carrying.
Then,
dabbing
his
mouth,
he
slid
in
beside
Remy
and
closed
the
door.
Remy
held
up
the
keystone
like
a
trophy.
"It
was
almost
lost."
"You
have
done
well,"
the
Teacher
said.
"We
have
done
well,"
Remy
replied,
laying
the
keystone
in
the
Teacher's
eager
hands.
The
Teacher
admired
it
a
long
moment,
smiling.
"And
the
gun?
You
wiped
it

the

I
found
it."
"Excellent."
The
Teacher
took
another

of
cognac
and
handed
the
flask
to
Remy.
"Let's
toast
our
success.
The
end
is
near."
Remy
accepted
the
bottle
gratefully.
The
cognac
tasted
salty,
but
Remy
didn't
care.
He
and
the
Teacher
were
truly
partners
now.
He

feel
