meet
for
drinks
after
Langdon's
lecture
tonight,
but
Sauniere
had
never
shown
up.
"Yes.
How
did
you
know
that?"
"We
found
your
name
in
his
daily
planner."
"I
trust
nothing
is
wrong?"
The
agent
gave
a
dire
sigh
and
slid
a
Polaroid
snapshot
through
the
narrow
opening
in
the
door.
When
Langdon
saw
the
photo,
his
entire
body
went
rigid.
"This

The
image
was
gruesome
and
profoundly
strange,
bringing
with
it
an
unsettling
sense
of
deja
vu.
A
little
over
a
year
ago,
Langdon
had
received
a
photograph
of
a
corpse
and
a
similar
request
for
help.
Twenty
four
hours
later,
he
had
almost
lost
his
life
inside
Vatican
City.
This
photo
was
entirely
different,
and
yet
something

scenario
felt
disquietingly
familiar.
The
agent
checked
his
watch.
"My
