folly.
I
implore
you
both
to
recognize
this
opportunity.
There
could
not
possibly
be
three
more
capable
people
assembled
at
this
moment
to
break
the
final
code
and
open
the
cryptex."
Teabing
paused,
his
eyes
alight.
"We
need
to
swear
an
oath
together.
A
pledge
of
faith
to
one
another.
A
knight's
allegiance
to
uncover
the
truth
and
make
it
known."
Sophie
stared
deep
into
Teabing's
eyes
and
spoke
in
a
steely
tone.
"I
will
never
swear
an
oath
with
my
grandfather's
murderer.
Except
an
oath
that
I
will
see
you
go
to
prison."
Teabing's
heart
turned
grave,
then
resolute.
"I
am
sorry
you
feel
that
way,
mademoiselle."
He
turned
and
aimed
the
gun
at
Langdon.
"And
you,
Robert?
Are
you
with
me,
or
against
me?"
Bishop
Manuel
Aringarosa's
body
had
endured
many
kinds
of
pain,
and
yet
the
searing
heat
of
the
bullet
wound
in
his
chest
felt
profoundly
foreign
to
him.
Deep
and
grave.
Not
a
wound
of
the
flesh
but
closer
to
the
soul.
He
opened
his
eyes,
trying
to
see,
but
the
rain
on
his
face
blurred
his
vision.
Where
am
I?
He
could
feel
powerful
arms
holding
him,
carrying
his
limp
body
like
a
rag
