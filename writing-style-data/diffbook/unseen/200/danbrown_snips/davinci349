his
legs,
he
carried
himself
with
a
resilient,
vertical
dignity
that
seemed
more
a
by
product
of
noble
ancestry
than
any
kind
of
conscious
effort.
Teabing
arrived
and
extended
a
hand
to
Langdon.
"Robert,
you've
lost
weight."
Langdon
grinned.
"And
you've
found
some."
Teabing
laughed
heartily,
patting
his
rotund
belly.
"Touche.
My
only
carnal
pleasures
these
days
seem
to
be
culinary.
"
Turning
now
to
Sophie,
he
gently
took
her
hand,
bowing
his
head
slightly,
breathing
lightly
on
her
fingers,
and
diverting
his
eyes.
"M'lady."
Sophie
glanced
at
Langdon,
uncertain
whether
she'd
stepped
back
in
time
or
into
a
nuthouse.
The
butler
who
had
answered
the
door
now
entered
carrying
a
tea
service,
which
he
arranged
on
a
table
in
front
of
the
fireplace.
"This
is
Remy
Legaludec,"
Teabing
said,
"my
manservant."
The
slender
butler
gave
a
stiff
nod
and
disappeared
yet
again.
"Remy
is
Lyonais,
"
Teabing
whispered,
as
if
it
were
an
unfortunate
disease.
"But
he
does
sauces
quite
nicely."
Langdon
looked
amused.
"I
would
have
thought
you'd
import
an
English
staff?"
"Good
heavens,
no!
I
would
not
wish
a
British
chef
on
anyone
except
the
French
tax
collectors."
He
glanced
over
at
Sophie.
"Pardonnez
moi,
Mademoiselle
Neveu.
