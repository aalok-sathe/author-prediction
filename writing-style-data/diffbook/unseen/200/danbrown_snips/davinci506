in
for
deceleration,
streaking
from
right
to
left
in
front
of
the
terminal,
its
white
hull
glistening
in
the
wet
weather.
But
rather
than
braking
and
turning
into
the
terminal,
the
jet
coasted
calmly
past
the
access
lane
and
continued
on
toward
Teabing's
hangar
in
the
distance.
All
the
police
spun
and
stared
at
Edwards.
"I
thought
you
said
the
pilot
agreed
to
come
to
the
terminal
!
Edwards
was
bewildered.
"He
did!"
Seconds
later,
Edwards
found
himself
wedged
in
a
police
car
racing
across
the
tarmac
toward
the
distant
hangar.
The
convoy
of
police
was
still
a
good
five
hundred
yards
away
as
Teabing's
Hawker
taxied
calmly
into
the
private
hangar
and
disappeared.
When
the
cars
finally
arrived
and
skidded
to
a
stop
outside
the
gaping
hangar
door,
the
police
poured
out,
guns
drawn.
Edwards
jumped
out
too.
The
noise
was
deafening.
The
Hawker's
engines
were
still
roaring
as
the
jet
finished
its
usual
rotation
inside
the
hangar,
positioning
itself
nose
out
in
preparation
for
later
departure.
As
the
plane
completed
its
180
degree
turn
and
rolled
toward
the
front
of
the
hangar,
Edwards
could
see
the
pilot's
face,
which
understandably
looked
surprised
and
fearful
to
see
the
barricade
