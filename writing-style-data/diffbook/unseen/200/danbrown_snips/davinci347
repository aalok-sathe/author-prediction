Cathedral
in
a
rainstorm.
"Princess,
look
at
these
silly
creatures,"
he
had
told
her,
pointing
to
the
gargoyle
rainspouts
with
their
mouths
gushing
water.
"Do
you
hear
that
funny
sound
in
their
throats?"
Sophie
nodded,
having
to
smile
at
the
burping
sound
of
the
water
gurgling
through
their
throats.
"They're
gargling,
"
her
grandfather
told
her.
"Gargariser!
And
that's
where
they
get
the
silly
name
'gargoyles.'
"
Sophie
had
never
again
been
afraid.
The
fond
memory
caused
Sophie
a
pang
of
sadness
as
the
harsh
reality
of
the
murder
gripped
her
again.
Grand
pere
is
gone.
She
pictured
the
cryptex
under
the
divan
and
wondered
if
Leigh
Teabing
would
have
any
idea
how
to
open
it.
Or
if
we
even
should
ask
him.
Sophie's
grandfather's
final
words
had
instructed
her
to
find
Robert
Langdon.
He
had
said
nothing
about
involving
anyone
else.
We
needed
somewhere
to
hide,
Sophie
said,
deciding
to
trust
Robert's
judgment.
"Sir
Robert!"
a
voice
bellowed
somewhere
behind
them.
"I
see
you
travel
with
a
maiden."
Langdon
stood
up.
Sophie
jumped
to
her
feet
as
well.
The
voice
had
come
from
the
top
of
a
curled
staircase
that
snaked
up
to
the
shadows
of
the
second
floor.
