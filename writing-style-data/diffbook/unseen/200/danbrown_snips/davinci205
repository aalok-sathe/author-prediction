the
right,
circling
properly
until
she
exited,
cut
left,
and
swung
into
the
northbound
lane,
accelerating
toward
Rue
de
Rivoli.
The
two
tone
police
sirens
blared
louder
behind
them,
and
Langdon
could
see
the
lights
now
in
his
side
view
mirror.
The
SmartCar
engine
whined
in
protest
as
Sophie
urged
it
faster
away
from
the
Louvre.
Fifty
yards
ahead,
the
traffic
light
at
Rivoli
turned
red.
Sophie
cursed
under
her
breath
and
kept
racing
toward
it.
Langdon
felt
his
muscles
tighten.
"Sophie?"
Slowing
only
slightly
as
they
reached
the
intersection,
Sophie
flicked
her
headlights
and
stole
a
quick
glance
both
ways
before
flooring
the
accelerator
again
and
carving
a
sharp
left
turn
through
the
empty
intersection
onto
Rivoli.
Accelerating
west
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile,
Sophie
banked
to
the
right
around
a
wide
rotary.
Soon
they
were
shooting
out
the
other
side
onto
the
wide
avenue
of
Champs
Ely
sees.
As
they
straightened
out,
Langdon
turned
in
his
seat,
craning
his
neck
to
look
out
the
rear
window
toward
the
Louvre.
The
police
did
not
seem
to
be
chasing
them.
The
sea
of
blue
lights
was
assembling
at
the
museum.
His
heartbeat
finally
slowing,
Langdon
turned
back
around.
"That
