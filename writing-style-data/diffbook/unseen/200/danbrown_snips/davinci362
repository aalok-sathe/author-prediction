fresco
portrayed
Jesus
and
His
disciples
at
the
moment
that
Jesus
announced
one
of
them
would
betray
Him.
"I
know
the
fresco,
yes."
"Then
perhaps
you
would
indulge
me
this
little
game?
Close
your
eyes
if
you
would."
Uncertain,
Sophie
closed
her
eyes.
"Where
is
Jesus
sitting?"
Teabing
asked.
"In
the
center."
"Good.
And
what
food
are
He
and
His
disciples
breaking
and
eating?"
"Bread."
Obviously.
"Superb.
And
what
drink?"
"Wine.
They
drank

"Great.
And
one

How

"One
cup,"
she
said.
"The
chalice."
The
Cup
of
Christ.
The

"Jesus
passed
a
single
chalice
of
wine,
just
as
modern
Christians
do
at
communion."
Teabing
sighed.
"Open
your
eyes."
She
did.
Teabing
was
grinning
smugly.
Sophie
looked
down
at
the
painting,
seeing
to
her
astonishment
that
everyone
at
the
table
had
a
glass
of
wine,
including
Christ.
Thirteen
cups.
Moreover,
the
cups
were
tiny,
stemless,
and
made
of
glass.
There
was
no
chalice
in
the
painting.
No
Holy
Grail.
Teabing's
eyes
twinkled.
"A
bit
strange,
don't
you
think,
