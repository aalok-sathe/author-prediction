headed
for
the
back
of
the
plane.
Sophie
felt
tired
as
she
watched
him
go.
Outside
the
window,
the
blackness
of
the
predawn
was
absolute.
Sophie
felt
as
if
she
were
being
hurtled
through
space
with
no
idea
where
she
would
land.
Having
grown
up
solving
her
grandfather's
riddles,
she
had
the
uneasy
sense
right
now
that
this
poem
before
them
contained
information
they
still
had
not
seen.
There
is
more

she
told
herself.
Ingeniously
hidden
but
present

what
they
eventually

"a
map
to
the
Holy

confidence
that
the

his
secrets
easily.
Bourget

traffic
controller
had
been
dozing
before
a
blank
radar
screen
when
the
captain
of
the
Judicial
Police
practically
broke
down
his
door.
"Teabing's
jet,"
Bezu
Fache
blared,
marching
into
the
small
tower,
"where
did
it
go?"
The
controller's
initial
response
was
a
babbling,
lame
attempt
to
protect
the
privacy
of
their
British
client
