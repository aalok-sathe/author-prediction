common
form
of
Jewish
cryptogram,
the
Atbash
Cipher
was
a
simple
substitution
code
based
on
the
twenty
two
letter
Hebrew
alphabet.
In
Atbash,
the
first
letter
was
substituted
by
the
last
letter,
the
second
letter
by
the
next
to
last
letter,
and
so
on.
"Atbash
is
sublimely
appropriate,"
Teabing
said.
"Text
encrypted
with
Atbash
is
found
throughout
the
Kabbala,
the
Dead
Sea
Scrolls,
and
even
the
Old
Testament.
Jewish
scholars
and
mystics
are
still
finding
hidden
meanings
using
Atbash.
The
Priory
certainly
would
include
the
Atbash
Cipher
as
part
of
their
teachings."
"The
only
problem,"
Langdon
said,
"is
that
we
don't
have
anything
on
which
to
apply
the
cipher."
Teabing
sighed.
"There
must
be
a
code
word
on
the
headstone.
We
must
find
this
headstone
praised
by
Templars."
Sophie
sensed
from
the
grim
look
on
Langdon's
face
that
finding
the
Templar
headstone
would
be
no
small
feat.
Atbash
is
the
key,
Sophie
thought.
But
we
don
't
have
a
door.
It
was
three
minutes
later
that
Teabing
heaved
a
frustrated
sigh
and
shook
his
head.
"My
friends,
I'm
stymied.
Let
me
ponder
this
while
I
get
us
some
nibblies
and
check
on
Remy
and
our
guest."
He
stood
up
and
