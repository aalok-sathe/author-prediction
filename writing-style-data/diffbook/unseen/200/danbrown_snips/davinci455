when
the
time
comes,
I
will
know
what
to
do."
Both
of
them
looked
startled.
"So
then,"
she
said,
motioning
to
the
rosewood
box.
"Let's
move
on.
Standing
in
the
drawing
room
of
Chateau
Villette,
Lieutenant
Collet
watched
the
dying
fire
and
felt
despondent.
Captain
Fache
had
arrived
moments
earlier
and
was
now
in
the
next
room,
yelling
into
the
phone,
trying
to
coordinate
the
failed
attempt
to
locate
the
missing
Range
Rover.
It
could
be
anywhere
by
now,
Collet
thought.
Having
disobeyed
Fache's
direct
orders
and
lost
Langdon
for
a
second
time,
Collet
was
grateful
that
PTS
had
located
a
bullet
hole
in
the
floor,
which
at
least
corroborated
Collet's
claims
that
a
shot
had
been
fired.
Still,
Fache's
mood
was
sour,
and
Collet
sensed
there
would
be
dire
repercussions
when
the
dust
settled.
Unfortunately,
the
clues
they
were
turning
up
here
seemed
to
shed
no
light
at
all
on
what
was
going
on
or
who
was
involved.
The
black
Audi
outside
had
been
rented
in
a
false
name
with
false
credit
card
numbers,
and
the
prints
in
the
car
matched
nothing
in
the
Interpol
database.
Another
agent
hurried
into
the
living
room,
his
eyes
urgent.
"Where's
Captain
Fache?"
