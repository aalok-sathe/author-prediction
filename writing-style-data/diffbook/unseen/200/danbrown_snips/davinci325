sped
back
toward
Rome,
Aringarosa
again
found
himself
wondering
why
the
Teacher
had
not
yet
contacted
him.
Pulling
his
cell
phone
from
his
cassock
pocket,
he
checked
the
carrier
signal.
Extremely
faint.
"Cell
service
is
intermittent
up
here,"
the
driver
said,
glancing
at
him
in
the
rearview
mirror.
"In
about
five
minutes,
we'll
be
out
of
the
mountains,
and
service
improves."
"Thank
you."
Aringarosa
felt
a
sudden
surge
of
concern.
No
service
in
the
mountains?
Maybe
the
Teacher
had
been
trying
to
reach
him
all
this
time.
Maybe
something
had
gone
terribly
wrong.
Quickly,
Aringarosa
checked
the
phone's
voice
mail.
Nothing.
Then
again,
he
realized,
the
Teacher
never
would
have
left
a
recorded
message;
he
was
a
man
who
took
enormous
care
with
his
communications.
Nobody
understood
better
than
the
Teacher
the
perils
of
speaking
openly
in
this
modern
world.
Electronic
eavesdropping
had
played
a
major
role
in
how
he
had
gathered
his
astonishing
array
of
secret
knowledge.
For
this
reason,
he
takes
extra
precautions.
Unfortunately,
the
Teacher's
protocols
for
caution
included
a
refusal
to
give
Aringarosa
any
kind
of
contact
number.
alone
will
initiate
contact,
the
Teacher
had
informed
him.
So
keep
your
phone
close.
Now
that
Aringarosa
realized
