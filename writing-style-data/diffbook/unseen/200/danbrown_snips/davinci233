peering
now
at
the
blunt
end
of
the
triangular
shaft.
Nothing.
Squinting,
he
brought
the
key
close
to
his
eyes
and
examined
the
rim
of
the
head.
Nothing
there
either.
"I
think
this
key
was
cleaned
recently."
"Why?"
"It
smells
like
rubbing
alcohol."
She
turned.
"I'm
sorry?"
"It
smells
like
somebody
polished
it
with
a
cleaner."
Langdon
held
the
key
to
his
nose
and
sniffed.
"It's
stronger
on
the
other
side."
He
flipped
it
over.
"Yes,
it's
alcohol
based,
like
it's
been
buffed
with
a
cleaner
or
"
Langdon
stopped.
"What?"
He
angled
the
key
to
the
light
and
looked
at
the
smooth
surface
on
the
broad
arm
of
the
cross.
It
seemed
to
shimmer
in
places
like
it
was
wet.
"How
well
did
you
look
at
the
back
of
this
key
before
you
put
it
in
your
pocket?"
"What?
Not
well.
I
was
in
a
hurry."
Langdon
turned
to
her.
"Do
you
still
have
the
black
light?"
Sophie
reached
in
her
pocket
and
produced
the
UV
penlight.
Langdon
took
it
and
switched
it
on,
shining
the
beam
on
the
back
of
the
key.
The
back
luminesced
instantly.
There
was
writing
there.
In
penmanship
that
was
hurried
but
legible.
Well,"
