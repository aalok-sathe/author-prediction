Verse
eleven.
Although
Silas
did
not
recall
the
exact
contents
of
verse
eleven
by
heart,
he
knew
the
Book
of
Job
told
the
story
of
a
man
whose
faith
in
God
survived
repeated
tests.
Appropriate,
he
thought,
barely
able
to
contain
his
excitement.
Looking
over
his
shoulder,
he
gazed
down
the
shimmering
Rose
Line
and
couldn't
help
but
smile.
There

horrified
bewilderment.
His
broad,

red
slashes.
Even
from
here
she
could
see
the
wounds
were
fresh.
This
man
has
been
mercilessly
whipped!
She
also
saw
the
bloody
cilice
around
his
thigh,
the
wound
beneath
it
dripping.
What
kind
of
God
would
want
a
body
punished
this
way?
The
rituals
of
Opus
Dei,
Sister
Sandrine
knew,
were
not
something
she
would
ever
understand.
But
that
was
hardly
her
concern
at
this
instant.
Opus
Dei
