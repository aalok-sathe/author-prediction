before
the
police
arrived.
The
sound
of
voices
echoed
down
the
marble
corridor
up
ahead.
The
noise
seemed
to
be
coming
from
a
large
recessed
alcove
that
lay
ahead
on
the
right.
A
bright
light
spilled
out
into
the
hallway.
"Office
of
the
curator,"
the
captain
said.
As
he
and
Fache
drew
nearer
the
alcove,
Langdon
peered
down
a
short
hallway,
into
Sauniere's
luxurious
study
warm
wood,
Old
Master
paintings,
and
an
enormous
antique
desk
on
which
stood
a
two
foot
tall
model
of
a
knight
in
full
armor.
A
handful
of
police
agents
bustled
about
the
room,
talking
on
phones
and
taking
notes.
One
of
them
was
seated
at
Sauniere's
desk,
typing
into
a
laptop.
Apparently,
the
curator's
private
office
had
become
DCPJ's
makeshift
command
post
for
the
evening.
"Messieurs,
"
Fache
called
out,
and
the
men
turned.
"Ne
nous
derangez
pas
sous
aucun
pretexte.
Entendu?"
Everyone
inside
the
office
nodded
their
understanding.
Langdon
had
hung
enough
NE
PAS
DERANGER
signs
on
hotel
room
doors
to
catch
the
gist
of
the
captain's
orders.
Fache
and
Langdon
were
not
to
be
disturbed
under
any
circumstances.
Leaving
the
small
congregation
of
agents
behind,
Fache
led
Langdon
farther
down
the
darkened
hallway.
