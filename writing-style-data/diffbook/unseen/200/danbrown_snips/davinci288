he
would
have
chosen
an
account
number
that
had
meaning
to
him,
something
he
could
easily
remember."
She
finished
typing
the
entry
and
gave
a
sly
smile.
"Something
that
appeared
random
but
was
not.
"
Langdon
looked
at
the
screen.
ACCOUNT
NUMBER:
1123581321
It
took
him
an
instant,
but
when
Langdon
spotted
it,
he
knew
she
was
right.
The
Fibonacci
sequence.

When
the
Fibonacci
sequence
was
melded
into
a
single
ten
digit
number,
it
became
virtually
unrecognizable.
Easy
to
remember,
and
yet
seemingly
random.
A
brilliant
ten
digit
code
that
Sauniere
would
never
forget.
Furthermore,
it
perfectly
explained
why
the
scrambled
numbers
on
the
Louvre
floor
could
be
rearranged
to
form
the
famous
progression.
Sophie
reached
down
and
pressed
the
ENTER
key.
Nothing
happened.
At
least
nothing
they
could
detect.
At
that
moment,
beneath
them,
in
the
bank's
cavernous
subterranean
vault,
a
robotic
claw
sprang
to
life.
Sliding
on
a
double
axis
transport
system
attached
to
the
ceiling,
the
claw
headed
off
in
search
of
the
proper
coordinates.
On
the
cement
floor
below,
hundreds
of
identical
plastic
crates
lay
aligned
on
an
enormous
grid
like
rows
of
small
coffins
in
an
underground
