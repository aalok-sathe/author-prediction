"We
need
to
refine
the
parameters
further,"
Gettum
said,
stopping
the
search.
"Is
this
all
the
information
you
have
regarding
the
tomb?
There's
nothing
else
to
go
on?"
Langdon
glanced
at
Sophie

looking
uncertain.
This
is

Gettum
sensed.

can
only
assume
you
are
on
a
Grail
quest."
Langdon
and
Sophie
exchanged
