elegant
storefronts
on
Champs
Ely
sees.
"How
much
cash
do
you
have?"
Langdon
checked
his
wallet.
"A
hundred
dollars.
A
few
euro.
Why?"
"Credit
cards?"
"Of
course."
As
Sophie
accelerated,
Langdon
sensed
she
was
formulating
a
plan.
Dead
ahead,
at
the
end
of
Champs
Elysees,
stood
the
Arc
de
Triomphe
Napoleon's
164
foot
tall
tribute
to
his
own
military
potency
encircled
by
France's
largest
rotary,
a
nine
lane
behemoth.
Sophie's
eyes
were
on
the
rearview
mirror
again
as
they
approached
the
rotary.
"We
lost
them
for
the
time
being,"
she
said,
"but
we
won't
last
another
five
minutes
if
we
stay
in
this
car."
So
steal
a
different
one,
Langdon
mused,
now
that
we're
criminals.
"What
are
you
going
to
do?"
Sophie
gunned
the
SmartCar
into
the
rotary.
"Trust
me."
Langdon
made
no
response.
Trust
had
not
gotten
him
very
far
this
evening.
Pulling
back
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket,
he
checked
his
watch
a
vintage,
collector's
edition
Mickey
Mouse
wristwatch
that
had
been
a
gift
from
his
parents
on
his
tenth
birthday.
Although
its
juvenile
dial
often
drew
odd
looks,
Langdon
had
never
owned
any
other
watch;
Disney
animations
had
been
his
first
introduction
to
the
magic
of
form
