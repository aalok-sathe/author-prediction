a
niche,
obscured
from
this
oblique
angle.
"At
least
there's
nobody
over
there,"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
nodded,
relieved.
The
entire
section
of
the
nave
near
Newton's
tomb
was
deserted.
"I'll
go
over,"
he
whispered.
"You
should
stay
hidden
just
in
case
someone
Sophie
had
already
stepped
from
the
shadows
and
was
headed
across
the
open
floor.
"
is
watching,"
Langdon
sighed,
hurrying
to
join
her.
Crossing
the
massive
nave
on
a
diagonal,
Langdon
and
Sophie
remained
silent
as
the
elaborate
sepulchre
revealed
itself
in
tantalizing
increments
a
black
marble
sarcophagus
a
reclining
statue
of
Newton
two
winged
boys
a
huge
pyramid
and
an
enormous
orb.
"Did
you
know
about
that?"
Sophie
said,
sounding
startled.
Langdon
shook
his
head,
also
surprised.
"Those
look
like
constellations
carved
on
it,"
Sophie
said.
As
they
approached
the
niche,
Langdon
felt
a
slow
sinking
sensation.
Newton's
tomb
was
covered
with
orbs
stars,
comets,
planets.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb?
It
could
turn
out
to
be
like
trying
to
find
a
missing
blade
of
grass
on
a
golf
course.
"Astronomical
bodies,"
Sophie
said,
looking
concerned.
"And
a
lot
of
them."
Langdon
frowned.
The
only
link
between
the
planets
and
the
Grail
