my
lawyers."
He
scowled
toward
the
monk
in
the
rear
of
the
plane.
"That
animal
broke
into
my
home
and
almost
killed
me.
That
is
a
fact,
and
Remy
will
corroborate."
"But
you
tied
him
up
and
flew
him
to
London!"
Langdon
said.
Teabing
held
up
his
right
hand
and
feigned
a
courtroom
oath.
"Your
honor,
forgive
an
eccentric
old
knight
his
foolish
prejudice
for
the
British
court
system.
I
realize
I
should
have
called
the
French
authorities,
but
I'm
a
snob
and
do
not
trust
those
laissez
faire
French
to
prosecute
properly.
This
man
almost
murdered
me.
Yes,
I
made
a
rash
decision
forcing
my
manservant
to
help
me
bring
him
to
England,
but
I
was
under
great
stress.
Mea
culpa.
Mea
culpa."
Langdon
looked
incredulous.
"Coming
from
you,
Leigh,
that
just
might
fly."
"Sir?"
the
pilot
called
back.
"The
tower
just
radioed.
They've
got
some
kind
of
maintenance
problem
out
near
your
hangar,
and
they're
asking
me
to
bring
the
plane
directly
to
the
terminal
instead."
Teabing
had
been
flying
to
Biggin
Hill
for
over
a
decade,
and
this
was
a
first.
"Did
they
mention
what
the
problem
is?"
"The
controller
was
vague.
Something
about
a
gas
leak
