her
or
try
to
meet
her
in
public.
She
was
afraid
his
explanation
would
be
more
terrifying
than
the
incident
itself.
Incredibly,
Sauniere
had
never
given
up
on
her,
and
Sophie
now
possessed
a
decade's
worth
of
correspondence
unopened
in
a
dresser
drawer.
To
her
grandfather's
credit,
he
had
never
once
disobeyed
her
request
and
phoned
her.
Until
this
afternoon.
"Sophie?"
His
voice
had
sounded
startlingly
old
on
her
answering
machine.
"I
have
abided
by
your
wishes
for
so
long
and
it
pains
me
to
call,
but
I
must
speak
to
you.
Something
terrible
has
happened."
Standing
in
the
kitchen
of
her
Paris
flat,
Sophie
felt
a
chill
to
hear
him
again
after
all
these
years.
His
gentle
voice
brought
back
a
flood
of
fond
childhood
memories.
"Sophie,
please
listen."
He
was
speaking
English
to
her,
as
he
always
did
when
she
was
a
little
girl.
Practice
French
at
school.
Practice
English
at
home.
"You
cannot
be
mad
forever.
Have
you
not
read
the
letters
that
I've
sent
all
these
years?
Do
you
not
yet
understand?"
He
paused.
"We
must
speak
at
once.
Please
grant
your
grandfather
this
one
wish.
Call
me
at
the
Louvre.
Right
away.
I
believe
you
