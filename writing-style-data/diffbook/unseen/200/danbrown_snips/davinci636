New
York,
he
stared
out
at
the
skyline
in
disillusionment
for
days,
overwhelmed
with
sadness
for
the
future
of
Christianity.
It
was
several
weeks
later
that
he
received
the
phone
call
that
changed
all
that.
The
caller
sounded
French
and
identified
himself
as
the
Teacher
a
title
common
in
the
prelature.
He
said
he
knew
of
the
Vatican's
plans
to
pull
support
from
Opus
Dei.
How
could
he
know
that?
Aringarosa
wondered.
He
had
hoped
only
a

of
Vatican
power

knew

the
hiding
place
of
a
sacred
relic
that
will
bring
you
enormous
power
enough
power
to
make
the
Vatican
bow
before
you.
Enough
power
to
save
the
Faith."
He
paused.
"Not
just
for
Opus
Dei.
But
for
all
of
us."
The
Lord
taketh
away
and
the
Lord
giveth.
Aringarosa
felt
a
glorious
ray
of
hope.
"Tell
me
your
plan."
Bishop
Aringarosa
was
