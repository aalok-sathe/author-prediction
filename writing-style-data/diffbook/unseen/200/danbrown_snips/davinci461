an
admonishing
glare.
"And
frankly,
sir,
considering
your
allegiance
to
the
Crown,
I'm
a
little
surprised
you
didn't
recognize
it."
In
a
flash,
Langdon
knew.
No
wonder
the
script
looks
so
damned
familiar!
Several
years
ago,
Langdon
had
attended
an
event
at
Harvard's
Fogg
Museum.
Harvard
dropout
Bill
Gates
had
returned
to
his
alma
mater
to
lend
to
the
museum
one
of
his
priceless
acquisitions
eighteen
sheets
of
paper
he
had
recently
purchased
at
auction
from
the
Armand
Hammar
Estate.
His
winning
bid
a
cool
$30.8
million.
The
author
of
the
pages
Leonardo
da

The
eighteen
folios
now
known
as
Leonardo's
Codex
Leicester
after
their
famous
owner,
the
Earl
of
Leicester
were
all

one
of
Leonardo's
most
fascinating
notebooks:
essays
and

outlining
Da
Vinci's
progressive
theories
on
astronomy,
geology,
archaeology,
and
hydrology.
Langdon
would
never
forget
his
reaction
after
waiting
in
line
and
finally
viewing
the
priceless
parchment.
Utter
letdown.
The
pages
were
unintelligible.
Despite
being
beautifully
preserved
and
written
in
an
impeccably
neat
penmanship
crimson
ink
on
cream
paper
the
codex
looked
like
gibberish.
At
first
Langdon
thought
he
could
not
read
them
because
Da
Vinci
wrote
his
notebooks
in
an
archaic
Italian.
But
