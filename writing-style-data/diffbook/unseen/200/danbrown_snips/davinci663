on

the

sat;
or,
as

preferred
to

from
the
"Line

The
chapel
would
be
closing
soon,
and
as
Langdon
pulled
open
the
door,

the
ancient
edifice
were

sigh
at
the
end
of
a
long
day.

cornucopias,
pyramids,
astrological
signs,
plants,
vegetables,

but
Rosslyn
was
considered
their
most

veneration.
The
