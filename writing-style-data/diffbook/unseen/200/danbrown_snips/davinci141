"My
friends,
as
you
can
see,
the
chaos
of
the
world
has
an
underlying
order.
When
the
ancients
discovered
PHI,
they
were
certain
they
had
stumbled
across
God's
building
block
for
the
world,
and
they
worshipped
Nature
because
of
that.
And
one
can
understand
why.
God's
hand
is
evident
in
Nature,
and
even
to
this
day
there
exist
pagan,
Mother
Earth
revering
religions.
Many
of
us
celebrate
nature
the
way
the
pagans
did,
and
don't
even
know
it.
May
Day
is
a
perfect
example,
the
celebration
of
spring
the
earth
coming
back
to
life
to
produce
her
bounty.
The
mysterious
magic
inherent
in
the
Divine
Proportion
was
written
at
the
beginning
of
time.
Man
is
simply
playing
by
Nature's
rules,
and
because
art
is
man's
attempt
to
imitate
the
beauty
of
the
Creator's
hand,
you
can
imagine
we
might
be
seeing
a
lot
of
instances
of
the
Divine
Proportion
in
art
this
semester."
