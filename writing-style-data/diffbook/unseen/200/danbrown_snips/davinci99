earlier
because
I
didn't
want
you
checking
your
pocket
in
front
of
Fache.
He
can't
know
you've
found
it."
Langdon
had
no
idea
how
to
respond.
"They
tagged
you
with
GPS
because
they
thought
you
might
run."
She
paused.
"In
fact,
they
hoped
you
would
run;
it
would
make
their
case
stronger."
"Why
would
I
run!"
Langdon
demanded.
"I'm
innocent!"
"Fache
feels
otherwise."
Angrily,
Langdon
stalked
toward
the
trash
receptacle
to
dispose
of
the
tracking
dot.
"No!"
Sophie
grabbed
his
arm
and
stopped
him.
"Leave
it
in
your
pocket.
If
you
throw
it
out,
the
signal
will
stop
moving,
and
they'll
know
you
found
the
dot.
The
only
reason
Fache
left
you
alone
is
because
he
can
monitor
where
you
are.
If
he
thinks
you've
discovered
what
he's
doing"
Sophie
did
not
finish
the
thought.
Instead,
she
pried
the
metallic
disk
from
Langdon'
s
hand
and
slid
it
back
into
the
pocket
of
his
tweed
coat.
"The
dot
stays
with
you.
At
least
for
the
moment."
Langdon
felt
lost.
"How
the
hell
could
Fache
actually
believe
I
killed
Jacques
Sauniere!"
"He
has
some
fairly
persuasive
reasons
to
suspect
you."
Sophie's
expression
was
grim.
"There
is
a
piece
of
evidence
here
