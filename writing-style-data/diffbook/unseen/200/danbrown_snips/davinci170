a
member.
"I've
written
about
this
group,"
he
said,
his
voice
tremulous
with
excitement.
"Researching
the
symbols
of
secret
societies
is
a
specialty
of
mine.
They
call
themselves
the
Prieure
de
Sion
the
Priory
of
Sion.
They're
based
here
in
France
and
attract
powerful
members
from
all
over
Europe.
In
fact,
they
are
one
of
the
oldest
surviving
secret
societies
on
earth.
Sophie
had
never
heard

them.
Langdon
was

brotherhood's
Grand
Master,
which
might
help
explain
your
grandfather's
passion
for
Leonardo's
work.
The
two
men
share
a
historical
fraternal
bond.
And
it
all
fits
perfectly
with
their
fascination
for
goddess
iconology,
paganism,
feminine
deities,
and
contempt
for
the
Church.
The
Priory
has
a
well
documented
history
of
reverence
for
the
sacred
feminine."
"You're

group
