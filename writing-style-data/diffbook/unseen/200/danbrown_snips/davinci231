decided
to
stop
trying
to
keep
ahead
of
Sophie
Neveu.
Using
his
Visa
card,
he
purchased
two
coach
tickets
to
Lyon
and
handed
them
to
Sophie.
Sophie
guided
him
out
toward
the
tracks,
where
a
familiar
tone
chimed
overhead
and
a
P.A.
announcer
gave
the
final
boarding
call
for
Lyon.
Sixteen
separate
tracks
spread
out
before
them.
In
the
distance
to
the
right,
at
quay
three,
the
train
to
Lyon
was
belching
and
wheezing
in
preparation
for
departure,
but
Sophie
already
had
her
arm
through
Langdon's
and
was
guiding
him
in
the
exact
opposite
direction.
They
hurried
through
a
side
lobby,
past
an
all
night
cafe,
and
finally
out
a
side
door
onto
a
quiet
street
on
the
west

of
the
station.
A
lone
taxi
sat
idling
by
the
doorway.
The
driver
saw
Sophie
and
flicked
his
lights.
Sophie
jumped
in
the
back
seat.
Langdon
got
in
after
her.
As
the
taxi
pulled
away
from
station,
Sophie
took
out
their
newly
purchased
train
tickets
and
tore
them
up.
Langdon
sighed.
Seventy
dollars
well
spent.
It
was
not
until
their
taxi
had
settled
into
a
monotonous
northbound
hum
on
Rue
de
Clichy
that
Langdon
felt
they'd
actually
escaped.
Out
