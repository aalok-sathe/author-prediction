with
him
as
the
taxi
raced
westward.
"But
first
I
want
you
to
tell
me
everything
you
know
about
this
Priory
of
Sion."
Outside
the
Salle
des
Etats,
Bezu
Fache
was
fuming
as
Louvre
warden
Grouard
explained
how
Sophie
and
Langdon
had
disarmed
him.
Why
didn't
you
just
shoot
the
blessed
painting!
"Captain?"
Lieutenant
Collet
loped
toward
them
from
the
direction
of
the
command
post.
"Captain,
I
just
heard.
They

car."
"Did
she
make
the

it
is
and
put
plainclothes
on
watch
in
case
they
try
to
come
back

Send
men
to
search
the
streets
around
the
station
in
case
they
fled
on
foot.
Are
buses
running
from
the
station?"
"Not
at
this
hour,
sir.
Only
the
taxi
queue."
"Good.
Question
the
drivers.
See
if
they
saw
anything.
Then
contact
the
taxi
company
dispatcher
with
descriptions.
