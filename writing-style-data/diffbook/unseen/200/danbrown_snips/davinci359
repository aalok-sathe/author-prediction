of
Christ's
life.
Nobody
is
saying
Christ
was
a
fraud,
or
denying
that
He
walked
the
earth
and
inspired
millions
to
better
lives.
All
we
are
saying
is
that
Constantine
took
advantage
of
Christ's
substantial
influence
and
importance.
And
in
doing
so,
he
shaped
the
face
of
Christianity
as
we
know
it
today."
Sophie
glanced
at
the
art
book
before
her,
eager
to
move
on
and
see
the
Da
Vinci
painting
of
the
Holy
Grail.
"The
twist
is
this,"
Teabing
said,
talking
faster
now.
"Because
Constantine
upgraded
Jesus'
status
almost
four
centuries
after
Jesus'
death,
thousands
of
documents
already
existed
chronicling
His
life
as
a
mortal
man.
To
rewrite
the
history
books,
Constantine
knew
he
would
need
a
bold
stroke.
From
this
sprang
the
most
profound
moment
in
Christian
history."
Teabing
paused,
eyeing
Sophie.
"Constantine
commissioned
and
financed
a
new
Bible,
which
omitted
those
gospels
that
spoke
of
Christ's
human
traits
and
embellished
those
gospels
that
made
Him
godlike.
The
earlier
gospels
were
outlawed,
gathered
up,
and
burned."
"An
interesting
note,"
Langdon
added.
"Anyone
who
chose
the
forbidden
gospels
over
Constantine's
version
was
deemed
a
heretic.
The
word
heretic
derives
from
that
moment
in
history.
The
Latin
word
haereticus
means
