Gallery,
knowing
he
was
about
to
die.
It
seemed
logical.
"An
accusation
against
his
murderer
makes
sense,
I
suppose."
"My
job,
of
course,
is
to
put
a
name
to
that
person.
Let
me
ask
you
this,
Mr.
Langdon.
To
your
eye,
beyond
the
numbers,
what
about
this
message
is
most
strange?"
Most
strange?
A
dying
man
had
barricaded
himself
in
the
gallery,
drawn
a
pentacle
on
himself,
and
scrawled
a
mysterious
accusation
on
the
floor.
What
about
the
scenario
wasn't
strange?
"The
word
'Draconian'?"
he
ventured,
offering
the
first
thing
that
came
to
mind.
Langdon
was
fairly
certain
that
a
reference
to
Draco
the
ruthless
seventh
century
B.C.
politician
was
an
unlikely
dying
thought.
"
'Draconian
devil'
seems
an
odd
choice
of
vocabulary."
"Draconian?"
Fache's
tone
came
with
a
tinge
of
impatience
now.
"Sauniere's
choice
of
vocabulary
hardly
seems
the
primary
issue
here."
Langdon
wasn't
sure
what
issue
Fache
had
in
mind,
but
he
was
starting
to
suspect
that
Draco
and
Fache
would
have
gotten
along
well.
"Sauniere
was
a
Frenchman,"
Fache
said
flatly.
"He
lived
in
Paris.
And
yet
he
chose
to
write
this
message"
"In
English,"
Langdon
said,
now
realizing
the
captain's
meaning.
Fache
nodded.
"Precisement.
Any
idea
