into
the
woods,
wondering
where
they
should
go
next.
They
had
no
idea
how
to
open
the
cryptex,
or
why
Sauniere
had
given
it
to
them.
Unfortunately,
their
survival
tonight
seemed
to
depend
on
getting
answers
to
those
very
questions.
We
need
help,
Langdon
decided.
Professional
help.
In
the
world
of
the
Holy
Grail
and
the
Priory
of
Sion,
that
meant
only
one
man.
The
challenge,
of
course,
would
be
selling
the
idea
to
Sophie.
Inside
the
armored
car,
while
Sophie
waited
for
Langdon
to

she
could
feel
the
weight

the
rosewood
box
on
her

my
grandfather
give
this

Sophie!
Use
your
head.
Grand
pere
is
trying
to
tell
you
something!
Opening
the
box,
she
eyed
the
cryptex's
dials.
A
proof
of
merit.
She
could
feel
her
grandfather's
hand
at
work.
The
keystone
is
a
map
that
can
be
followed
only
by
the
worthy.
It
sounded
like
her
grandfather
to
the
core.
Lifting
the
cryptex
out
of
the
box,
Sophie
ran
her
fingers
over
the
dials.
Five
letters.
She
rotated
the
dials
one
by
one.
The
