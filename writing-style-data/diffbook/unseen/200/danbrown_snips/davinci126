want
to
be
there
when
we
make
the
arrest."
As
Fache
jogged
back
down
the
length
of
the
Grand
Gallery,
he
wondered
if
Langdon
had
even
survived
the
fall.
Not
that
it
mattered.
Langdon
ran.
Guilty
as
charged.
Only
fifteen
yards
from
the
rest
room,
Langdon
and
Sophie
stood
in
the
darkness
of
the
Grand
Gallery,
their
backs
pressed
to
one
of
the
large
partitions
that
hid
the
bathrooms
from
the
gallery.
They
had
barely
managed
to
hide
themselves
before
Fache
had
darted
past
them,
gun
drawn,
and
disappeared
into
the
bathroom.
The
last
sixty
seconds
had
been
a
blur.
Langdon
had
been
standing
inside
the
men's
room
refusing
to
run
from
a
crime
he
didn't
commit,
when
Sophie
began
eyeing
the
plate
glass
window
and
examining
the
alarm
mesh
running
through
it.
Then
she
peered
downward
into
the
street,
as
if
measuring
the
drop.
"With
a
little
aim,
you
can
get
out
of
here,"
she
said.
Aim?
Uneasy,
he
peered
out
the
rest
room
window.
Up
the
street,
an
enormous
twin
bed
eighteenwheeler
was
headed
for
the
stoplight
beneath
the
window.
Stretched
across
the
truck's
massive
cargo
bay
was
a
blue
vinyl
tarp,
loosely
covering
the
truck's
load.
