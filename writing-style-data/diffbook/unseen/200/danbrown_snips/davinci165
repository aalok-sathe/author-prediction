loud
clang.
She
stared
down
at
the
key,
afraid
to
look
up
at
her
grandfather's
face.
"I
was
looking
for
my
birthday
present,"
she
said,
hanging
her
head,
knowing
she
had
betrayed
his
trust.
For
what
seemed
like
an
eternity,
her
grandfather
stood
silently
in
the
doorway.
Finally,
he
let
out
a
long
troubled
breath.
"Pick
up
the
key,
Sophie."
Sophie
retrieved
the
key.
Her
grandfather
walked
in.
"Sophie,
you

Gently,
he
knelt
down
and
took
the
key

You
need
to
learn
to
respect
other
people's
privacy."
"Yes,
Grand
pere.
"We'll
talk
about
this
some
other
time.
Right
now,
the
garden
needs
to
be
weeded."
Sophie
hurried
outside
to
do
her
chores.
The
next
morning,
Sophie
received
no
birthday
present
from
her
grandfather.
She
hadn't
expected

after
what

didn't
even
