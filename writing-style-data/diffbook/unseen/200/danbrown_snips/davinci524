Church.
The
rough
hewn

shimmered
in

rain,
and
doves
cooed
in
the
architecture
overhead.
London's
ancient
Temple
Church
was
constructed
entirely
of
Caen
stone.
A
dramatic,
circular
edifice
with
a
daunting
facade,
a
central
turret,
and
a
protruding
nave
off
one
side,
the
church
looked
more
like
a
military
stronghold
than
a
place
of
worship.
Consecrated
on
the

February
in

by
Heraclius,

survived
eight

was
coarse
and
simple,
more
reminiscent
of
Rome's
rugged
Castel
Sant'Angelo
than
the
refined
Pantheon.
The
boxy
annex
jutting
out
to
the
right
was
an
unfortunate
eyesore,
although
it
did
little
to
shroud
the
original
pagan
shape
of
the
primary
structure.
"It's
early
on
a
Saturday,"
Teabing
said,
hobbling
toward
the
entrance,
"so
I'm
assuming
we
won't
have
services
to
deal
with."
The
