the
cryptex,
and
the
liquid
inside
gurgled.
"A
vial
of
liquid."
"Liquid
what?"
Sophie
smiled.
"Vinegar."
Langdon
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
began
nodding.
"Brilliant."
Vinegar
and
papyrus,
Sophie
thought.
If
someone
attempted
to
force
open
the
cryptex,
the
glass
vial
would
break,
and
the
vinegar
would
quickly
dissolve
the
papyrus.
By
the
time
anyone
extracted
the
secret
message,
it
would
be
a
glob
of
meaningless
pulp.
"As
you
can
see,"
Sophie
told
him,
"the
only
way
to
access
the
information
inside
is
to
know
the
proper
five
letter
password.
And
with
five
dials,
each
with
twenty
six
letters,
that's
twenty
six
to
the
fifth
power."
She
quickly
estimated
the
permutations.
"Approximately
twelve
million
possibilities."
"If
you
say
so,"
Langdon
said,
looking
like
he
had
approximately
twelve
million
questions
running
through
his
head.
"What
information
do
you
think
is
inside?"
"Whatever
it
is,
my
grandfather
obviously
wanted
very
badly
to
keep
it
secret."
She
paused,
closing
the
box
lid
and
eyeing
the
five
petal
Rose
inlaid
on
it.
Something
was
bothering
her.
"Did
you
say
earlier
that
the
Rose
is
a
symbol
for
the
Grail?"
"Exactly.
In
Priory
symbolism,
the
Rose
and
the
Grail
are
synonymous."
Sophie
furrowed
her
brow.
