to
stop
him."
"Who
exactly
is
he?"
But
the
concierge
was
gone.
Almost
immediately,
a
heavy
fist
pounded
on
Langdon's
door.
Uncertain,
Langdon
slid
off
the
bed,
feeling
his
toes
sink
deep
into
the
savonniere
carpet.
He
donned
the
hotel
bathrobe
and
moved
toward
the
door.
"Who
is
it?"
"Mr.
Langdon?
I
need
to
speak
with
you."
The
man's
English
was
accented
a
sharp,
authoritative
bark.
"My
name
is
Lieutenant
Jerome
Collet.
Direction
Centrale
Police
Judiciaire."
Langdon
paused.
The
Judicial
Police?
The
DCPJ
was
the
rough
equivalent
of
the
U.S.
FBI.
Leaving
the
security
chain
in
place,
Langdon
opened
the
door
a
few
inches.
The
face
staring
back
at
him
was
thin
and
washed
out.
The
man
was
exceptionally
lean,
dressed
in
an
official
looking
blue
uniform.
"May
I
come
in?"
the
agent
asked.
Langdon
hesitated,
feeling
uncertain
as
the
stranger's
sallow
eyes
studied
him.
"What
is
this
all
about?"
"My
capitaine
requires
your
expertise
in
a
private
matter."
"Now?"
Langdon
managed.
"It's
after
midnight."
"Am
I
correct
that
you
were
scheduled
to
meet
with
the
curator
of
the
Louvre
this
evening?"
Langdon
felt
a
sudden
surge
of
uneasiness.
He
and
the
revered
curator
Jacques
Sauniere
had
been
slated
to
