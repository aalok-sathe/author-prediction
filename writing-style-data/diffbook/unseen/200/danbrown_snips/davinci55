The
stylus
wrote
in
a
noncorrosive,
alcohol
based
fluorescent
ink
that
was
visible
only
under
black
light.
Nowadays,
museum
maintenance
staffs
carried
these
markers
on
their
daily
rounds
to
place
invisible
"tick
marks"
on
the
frames
of
paintings
that
needed
restoration.
As
Langdon
stood
up,
Fache
walked
over
to
the
spotlight
and
turned
it
off.
The
gallery
plunged
into
sudden
darkness.
Momentarily
blinded,
Langdon
felt
a
rising
uncertainty.
Fache's
silhouette
appeared,
illuminated
in
bright
purple.
He
approached
carrying
a
portable
light
source,
which
shrouded
him
in
a
violet
haze.
"As
you
may
know,"
Fache
said,
his
eyes
luminescing
in
the
violet
glow,
"police
use
black
light
illumination
to
search
crime
scenes
for
blood
and
other
forensic
evidence.
So
you
can
imagine
our
surprise"
Abruptly,
he
pointed
the
light
down
at
the
corpse.
Langdon
looked
down
and
jumped
back
in
shock.
His
heart
pounded
as
he
took
in
the
bizarre
sight
now
glowing
before
him
on
the
parquet
floor.
Scrawled
in
luminescent
handwriting,
the
curator's
final
words
glowed
purple
beside
his
corpse.
As
Langdon
stared
at
the
shimmering
text,
he
felt
the
fog
that
had
surrounded
this
entire
night
growing
thicker.
