had
received
devastating
news.
His
life's
work
was
in
jeopardy.
He
recalled,
with
vivid
detail,
the
meeting
inside
Castel
Gandolfo
that
had
changed
his
life
the
news
that
had
set
this
entire
calamity
into
motion.
Aringarosa
had
entered
Gandolfo's
Astronomy
Library
with
his
head
held
high,
fully
expecting
to
be
lauded
by
throngs
of
welcoming
hands,
all
eager
to
pat
him
on
the

for
his
superior

reason
for
your
visit."
"Please.
Speak
openly."
Aringarosa
glanced
at
the
two
cardinals,
who
seemed
to
be
measuring
him
with
self
righteous
anticipation.
"As
you
are
well
aware,"
the
secretariat
said,
"His
Holiness
and
others
in
Rome
have
been
concerned
lately
with
the

fallout
from

Aringarosa
felt
