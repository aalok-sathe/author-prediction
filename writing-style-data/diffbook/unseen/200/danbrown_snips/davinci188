the
approaching
footsteps
out
in
the
hallway.
"Over
here!"
Sophie
extinguished
the
black
light
and
seemed
to
evaporate
before
Langdon's
eyes.
For
an
instant
he
felt
totally
blind.
Over
where!
As
his
vision
cleared
he
saw
Sophie's
silhouette
racing
toward
the
center
of
the
room
and
ducking
out
of
sight
behind
the
octagonal
viewing
bench.
He
was
about
to
dash
after
her
when
a
booming
voice
stopped

guard

spreading
Langdon
out.
"Mauvaise
idee,
Monsieur
Langdon,
"
he
said,
pressing
the
gun
hard
into
Langdon's
back.
"Mauvaise
idee.
Face
down
on
the
parquet
floor
with
his
arms
and
legs
spread
wide,
Langdon
found
little
humor
in
the
irony
of
his
position.
The
Vitruvian
Man,
he
thought.
Face
down.
Inside
Saint
Sulpice,
Silas
carried
the

votive
candle
holder
from
the
altar
