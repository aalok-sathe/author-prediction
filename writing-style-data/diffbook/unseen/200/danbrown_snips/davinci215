something
on
the
floor
before
them
something
Sophie
could
not
see.
The
chanting
grew
steady
again.
Accelerating.
Thundering
now.
Faster.
The
participants
took
a
step
inward
and
knelt.
In
that
instant,
Sophie
could
finally
see
what
they
all
were
witnessing.
Even
as
she
staggered
back
in
horror,
she
felt

"Sophie!
Langdon's
voice
intruded.
"Stop!

Emerging
