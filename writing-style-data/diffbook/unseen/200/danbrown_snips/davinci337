friends."
"You
know
the
estate?"
"I've
passed
it.
It's
in
the
castle
district.
Twenty
minutes
from
here."
Langdon
frowned.
"That
far?"
"Yes,
which
will
give
you
enough
time
to
tell
me
what
the
Holy
Grail
really
is."
Langdon
paused.
"I'll
tell
you
at
Teabing's.
He
and
I
specialize
in
different
areas
of
the
legend,
so
between
the
two
of
us,
you'll
get
the
full
story."
Langdon
smiled.
"Besides,
the
Grail
has
been
Teabing's
life,
and
hearing
the
story
of
the
Holy
Grail
from
Leigh
Teabing
will
be
like
hearing
the
theory
of
relativity
from
Einstein
himself."
"Let's
hope
Leigh
doesn't
mind
late
night
visitors."
"For
the
record,
it's
Sir
Leigh."
Langdon
had
made
that
mistake
only
once.
"Teabing
is
quite
a
character.
He
was
knighted
by
the
Queen
several
years
back
after
composing
an
extensive
history
on
the
House
of
York."
Sophie
looked
over.
"You're
kidding,
right?
We're
going
to
visit
a
knight?"
Langdon
gave
an
awkward
smile.
"We're
on
a
Grail
quest,
Sophie.
Who
better
to
help
us
than
a
knight?"
The
