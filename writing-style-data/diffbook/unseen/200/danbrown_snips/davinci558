end.
"The
base
is
a
high
capacity
hard
disk
audio
recording
system
with
rechargeable
battery.
That
strip
of
foil
at
the
end
of
the
wire
is
a
combination
microphone
and
photoelectric
recharging
cell."
Collet
knew
them
well.
These
foil
like,
photocell
microphones
had
been
an
enormous
breakthrough
a
few
years
back.
Now,
a
hard
disk
recorder
could
be
affixed
behind
a
lamp,
for
example,
with
its
foil
microphone
molded
into
the
contour
of
the
base
and
dyed
to
match.
As
long
as
the
microphone
was
positioned
such
that
it
received
a
few
hours
of
sunlight
per
day,
the
photo
cells
would
keep
recharging
the
system.
Bugs
like
this
one
could
listen
indefinitely.
"Reception
method?"
Collet
asked.
The
agent
signaled
to
an
insulated
wire
that
ran
out
of
the
back
of
the
computer,
up
the
wall,
through
a
hole
in
the
barn
roof.
"Simple
radio
wave.
Small
antenna
on
the
roof."
Collet
knew
these
recording
systems
were
generally
placed
in
offices,
were
voice
activated
to
save
hard
disk
space,
and
recorded
snippets
of
conversation
during
the
day,
transmitting
compressed
audio
files
at
night
to
avoid
detection.
After
transmitting,
the
hard
drive
erased
itself
and
prepared
to
do
it
all
over
again
