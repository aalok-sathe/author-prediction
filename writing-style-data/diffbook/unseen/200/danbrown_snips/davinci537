of
blood
on
the
pavement
near
where
the
limousine
had
been
parked.
Fache
walked
up
to
the
plane
and
rapped
loudly
on
the
fuselage.
"This
is
the
captain
of
the
French
Judicial
Police.
Open
the
door!"
The
terrified
pilot
opened
the
hatch
and
lowered
the
stairs.
Fache
ascended.
Three
minutes
later,
with
the
help
of
his
sidearm,
he
had
a
full
confession,
including
a
description
of
the
bound
albino
monk.
In

he
learned
that
the
pilot
saw
Langdon
and
Sophie
leave
something
behind
in
Teabing's

to

license."
The
pilot
wrung
his
hands.
"I
know
some
men
in
maintenance
here.
Maybe
they
could
drill
it?"
"You
have
half
an
hour."
The
pilot
leapt
for
his
radio.
Fache
strode
to
the
back
of
the
plane
and
poured
himself
a
hard
drink.
It
was
early,
but
he
had
