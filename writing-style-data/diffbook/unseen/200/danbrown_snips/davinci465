who
chose
to
write
their
social
commentaries
in
a
meter
that
many
of
the
day
believed
had
mystical
properties.
The
roots
of
iambic
pentameter
were
deeply
pagan.
Iambs.
Two
syllables
with
opposite
emphasis.
Stressed
and
unstressed.
Yin
yang.
A
balanced
pair.
Arranged
in
strings
of
five.
Pentameter.
Five
for
the
pentacle
of
Venus
and
the
sacred
feminine.

had
considered

the

for
those
brotherhoods
educated

to
learn
it.
"This
poem,"
Teabing
gushed,
"references
not
only
the
Grail,
but
the
Knights
Templar
and
the
scattered
family
of
Mary
Magdalene!
What
more
could
we
ask
for?"
"The
password,"
Sophie
said,
looking
again
at
the
poem.
"It
sounds
like
we
need
some
kind

"Abracadabra?"
Teabing
