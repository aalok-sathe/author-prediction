after
studying
them
more
closely,
he
realized
he
could
not
identify
a
single
Italian
word,
or
even
one
letter.
"Try
this,
sir,"
whispered
the
female
docent
at
the
display
case.
She
motioned
to
a
hand
mirror
affixed
to
the
display
on
a
chain.
Langdon
picked
it
up
and
examined
the
text
in
the
mirror's
surface.
Instantly
it
was
clear.
Langdon
had
been
so
eager
to
peruse
some
of
the
great
thinker's
ideas
that
he
had
forgotten
one
of
the
man's
numerous
artistic
talents
was
an
ability
to
write
in
a
mirrored
script
that
was
virtually
illegible

Historians

amuse

stealing
his
ideas,
but

was
moot.
Da
Vinci
did
as
he
pleased.
Sophie
smiled
inwardly
to
see
that
Robert
understood
her
meaning.
"I
can
read
the
first
few
words,"
she
said.
"It's
English."
Teabing
was
still
sputtering.
"What's
going
on?"
"Reverse
text,"
Langdon
said.
"We
need
a
mirror."
"No
we
don't,"
Sophie
said.
"I
bet
this
veneer
is
thin
enough."
She
lifted
the
rosewood
box
up
to
a
canister
light
on
the
wall
and
