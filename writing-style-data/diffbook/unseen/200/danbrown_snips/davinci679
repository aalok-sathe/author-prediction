very
infrequently,
and
always
in
the
most
secret
of
settings
under
the
protection
of
the
Priory.
There
are
certain
ceremonies
to
which
the
brotherhood
always
stays
faithful."
Langdon
had
sensed
the
story
went
far
deeper,
but
he
also
sensed
it
was
not
for
him
to
hear.
So
he
had
stepped
outside.
Now,
gazing
up
at
the
spires
of
Rosslyn,
Langdon
could
not
escape
the
hollow
gnaw
of
Rosslyn's
unsolved
mystery.
Is
the
Grail
really
here
at
Rosslyn?
And
if
so,
where
are
the
blade
and
chalice
that
Sauniere
mentioned
in
his
poem?
"I'll
take
that,"
Marie
said,
motioning
to
Langdon's
hand.
"Oh,
thank
you."
Langdon
held
out
his
empty
coffee
cup.
She
stared
at
him.
"I
was
referring
to
your
other
hand,
Mr.
Langdon."
Langdon
looked
down
and
realized
he
was
holding
Sauniere's
papyrus.
He
had
taken
it
from
the
cryptex
once
again
in
hopes
of
seeing
something
he
had
missed
earlier.
"Of
course,
I'm
sorry."
Marie
looked
amused
as
she
took
the
paper.
"I
know
of
a
man
at
a
bank
in
Paris
who
is
probably
very
eager
to
see
the
return
of
this
rosewood
box.
Andre
Vernet
was
a
dear
friend
of
Jacques,
and
Jacques
trusted
him
explicitly.
