when
the
client's
key
was
inserted
outside
in
the
entry
gate.
Instead,
the
guard
was
calling
the
bank's
night
manager.
As
the
line
rang,
the
guard
switched
the
television
back
on
and
stared
at
it.
The
news
story
he
had
been
watching
was
just
ending.
It
didn't
matter.
He
got
another
look
at
the
two
faces
on
the
television.
The
manager
answered.
"Oui?"
"We
have
a
situation
down
here."
"What's
happening?"
the
manager
demanded.
"The
French
police
are
tracking
two
fugitives
tonight."
"So?"
"Both
of
them
just
walked
into
our
bank."
The
manager
cursed
quietly.
"Okay.
I'll
contact
Monsieur
Vernet
immediately."
The
guard
then
hung
up
and
placed
a
second
call.
This
one
to
Interpol.
Langdon
was
surprised
to
feel
the
elevator
dropping
rather
than
climbing.
He
had
no
idea
how
many
floors
they
had
descended
beneath
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
before
the
door
finally
opened.
He
didn't
care.
He
was
happy
to
be
out
of
the
elevator.
Displaying
impressive
alacrity,
a
host
was
already
standing
there
to
greet
them.
He
was
elderly
and
pleasant,
wearing
a
neatly
pressed
flannel
suit
that
made
him
look
oddly
out
of
place
an
old
world
banker
in
a
high
tech
world.
"Bonsoir,
