Remy,"
Teabing
chimed
happily.
"The
lights
are
on.
Our
lives
are
in
your
hands."
"Where
are
we
going?"
Sophie
asked.
"This
trail
continues
about
three
kilometers
into
the
forest,"
Teabing
said.
"Cutting
across
the
estate
and
then
arching
north.
Provided
we
don't
hit
any
standing
water
or
fallen
trees,
we
shall
emerge
unscathed
on
the
shoulder
of
highway
five."
Unscathed.
Langdon's
head
begged
to
differ.
He
turned
his
eyes
down
to
his
own
lap,
where
the
keystone
was
safely
stowed
in
its
wooden
box.
The
inlaid
Rose
on
the
lid
was
back
in
place,
and
although
his
head
felt
muddled,
Langdon
was
eager
to
remove
the
inlay
again
and
examine
the
engraving
beneath
more
closely.
He
unlatched
the
lid
and
began
to
raise
it
when
Teabing
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
from
behind.
"Patience,
Robert,"
Teabing
said.
"It's
bumpy
and
dark.
God
save
us
if
we
break
anything.
If
you
didn't
recognize
the
language
in
the
light,
you
won't
do
any
better
in
the
dark.
Let's
focus
on
getting
away
in
one
piece,
shall
we?
There
will
be
time
for
that
very
soon."
Langdon
knew
Teabing
was
right.
With
a
nod,
he
relatched
the
box.
