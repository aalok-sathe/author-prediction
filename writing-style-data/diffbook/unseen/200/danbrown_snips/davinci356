was
acceptable

parties."
"Transmogrification,"
Langdon
said.
"The
vestiges
of
pagan
religion
in
Christian
symbology
are
undeniable.
Egyptian
sun
disks
became
the
halos
of
Catholic
saints.
Pictograms
of
Isis
nursing
her
miraculously
conceived
son
Horus
became
the
blueprint
for
our
modern
images
of
the
Virgin
Mary
nursing
Baby
Jesus.
And
virtually
all
the
elements
of
the
Catholic
ritual
the
miter,
the
altar,
the
doxology,
and
communion,
the
act
of
"God
eating"
were
taken
directly
from
earlier
pagan
mystery
religions."
Teabing
groaned.
"Don't
get
a
symbologist
started
on
Christian
icons.
Nothing

The
pre
Christian
God
Mithras
called
the
Son
of
God
and
the
Light

the
World
was
born
on
December
25,
died,
was
buried
in
a
rock
tomb,
and
then
resurrected
in
three
days.
By
the
way,
December
25
is
also
the
birthday
of
Osiris,
Adonis,
and
Dionysus.
The
newborn
Krishna
was
presented
with
gold,
frankincense,
and
myrrh.
Even
Christianity's
weekly
holy
day
was
stolen
from
the
pagans."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"Originally,"
Langdon
said,
"Christianity
honored
the
Jewish
Sabbath
of
Saturday,
but
Constantine
shifted
it
to
coincide
with
the
pagan's
veneration
day
of
the
sun."
He
paused,
grinning.
