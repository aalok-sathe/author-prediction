stood
a
large
wooden
door.
To
the
left
of
the
door,
looking
entirely
out
of
place,
hung
a
bulletin
board
covered
with
concert
schedules
and
religious
service
announcements.
Teabing
frowned
as
he
read
the
board.
"They
don't
open
to
sightseers
for
another
couple
of
hours."
He
moved
to
the
door
and
tried
it.
The
door
didn't
budge.
Putting
his
ear
to
the
wood,
he
listened.
After
a
moment,
he
pulled
back,
a
scheming
look
on
his
face
as
he
pointed
to
the
bulletin
board.
"Robert,
check
the
service
schedule,
will
you?
Who
is
presiding
this
week?"
Inside
the
church,
an
altar
boy
was
almost
finished
vacuuming
the
communion
kneelers
when
he
heard
a
knocking
on
the
sanctuary
door.
He
ignored
it.
Father
Harvey
Knowles
had
his
own
keys
and
was
not
due
for
another
couple
of
hours.
The
knocking
was
probably
a
curious
tourist
or
indigent.
The
altar
boy
kept
vacuuming,
but
the
knocking
continued.
Can't
you
read?
The
sign
on
the
door
clearly
stated
that
the
church
did
not
open
until
nine
thirty
on
Saturday.
The
altar
boy
remained
with
his
chores.
Suddenly,
the
knocking
turned
to
a
forceful
banging,
as
if
someone
were
hitting
the
door
with
a
