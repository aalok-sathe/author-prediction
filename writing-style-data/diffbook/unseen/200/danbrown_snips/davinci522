thousands
of
ancient
documents
as
scientific
evidence
that
the
New
Testament
is
false
testimony."
"But
you
told
me
the
New
Testament
is
based
on
fabrications."
Langdon
smiled.
"Sophie,
every
faith
in
the
world
is
based
on
fabrication.
That
is
the
definition
of
faith
acceptance
of
that
which
we
imagine
to
be
true,
that
which
we
cannot
prove.
Every
religion
describes
God
through
metaphor,
allegory,
and
exaggeration,
from
the
early
Egyptians
through
modern
Sunday
school.
Metaphors
are
a
way
to
help
our
minds
process
the
unprocessible.
The
problems
arise
when
we
begin
to
believe
literally
in
our
own
metaphors."
"So
you
are
in
favor
of
the
Sangreal
documents
staying
buried
forever?"
"I'm
a
historian.
I'm
opposed
to
the
destruction
of
documents,
and
I
would
love
to
see
religious
scholars
have
more
information
to
ponder
the
exceptional
life
of
Jesus
Christ."
"You're
arguing
both
sides
of
my
question."
"Am
I?
The
Bible
represents
a
fundamental
guidepost
for
millions
of
people
on
the
planet,
in
much
the
same
way
the
Koran,
Torah,
and
Pali
Canon
offer
guidance
to
people
of
other
religions.
If
you
and
I
could
dig
up
documentation
that
contradicted
the
holy
stories
of
Islamic
belief,
Judaic
belief,
Buddhist
belief,
pagan
