the
train
was
moving.
How
long?
How
far?
A
pain
was
growing
in
his
gut.
Am
I
dying
?
He
slept
again.
This
time
he
awoke
to
someone
yelling,
beating
him,
throwing
him
out
of
the
freight
car.
Bloody,
he
wandered
the
outskirts
of
a
small
village
looking
in
vain
for
food.
Finally,
his
body
too
weak
to
take
another
step,
he
lay
down
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
slipped
into
unconsciousness.
The
light
came
slowly,
and
the
ghost
wondered
how
long
he
had
been
dead.
A
day?
Three
days?
It
didn't
matter.
His
bed
was
soft
like
a
cloud,
and
the
air
around
him
smelled
sweet
with
candles.
Jesus
was
there,
staring
down
at
him.
am
here,
Jesus
said.
The
stone
has
been
rolled
aside,
and
you
are
born
again.
He
slept
and
awoke.
Fog
shrouded
his
thoughts.
He
had
never
believed
in
heaven,
and
yet
Jesus
was
watching
over
him.
Food
appeared
beside
his
bed,
and
the
ghost
ate
it,
almost
able
to
feel
the
flesh
materializing
on
his
bones.
He
slept
again.
When
he
awoke,
Jesus
was
still
smiling
down,
speaking.
You
are
saved,
my
son.
Blessed
are
those
who
follow
my
path.
Again,
he
