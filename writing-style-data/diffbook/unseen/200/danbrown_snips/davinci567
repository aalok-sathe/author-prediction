to

"Capitaine,
un
agent
du
Departement
de
Cryptographic
est
arrive.
Collet
could
not
believe
his
ears.
"That's
me!
That's
my
voice!"
He
recalled
sitting
at
Sauniere's
desk
and
radioing
Fache
in
the
Grand
Gallery
to
alert
him
of
Sophie
Neveu's
arrival.
The
agent
nodded.
"A
lot
of
our
Louvre
investigation
tonight
would
have
been
audible
if
someone
had
been
interested."
"Have
you
sent
anyone
in
to
sweep
for
the
bug?"
"No
need.
I
know
exactly
where
it
is."
The
agent
went
to
a
pile
of
old
notes
and
blueprints
on
the
worktable.
He
selected
a
page
and
handed
it
to
Collet.
"Look
familiar?"
Collet
was
amazed.
He
was
holding
a
photocopy
of
an
ancient
schematic
diagram,
which
depicted
a
rudimentary
machine.
He
was
unable
to
read
the
handwritten
Italian
labels,
and
yet
he
knew
what
he
was
looking
at.
A
model
for
a
fully
articulated
medieval
French
knight.
The
knight
sitting
on
Sauniere's
desk!
Collet's
eyes
moved
to
the
margins,
where
someone
had
scribbled
notes
on
the
photocopy
in
red
felt
tipped
marker.
The
notes
were
in
French
and
appeared
to
be
ideas
outlining
how
best
to
insert
a
listening
device
into
the
knight.
