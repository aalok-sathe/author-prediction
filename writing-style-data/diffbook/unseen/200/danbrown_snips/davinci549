of
in
life.
Since
then,
every
moment
he
had
spent
inside
Chateau
Villette
had
been
leading
him
to
this
very
instant.
am
so
close,
Remy
told
himself,
gazing
into
the
sanctuary
of
the
Temple
Church
and
the
keystone
in
Robert
Langdon's
hand.
If
Langdon
dropped
it,
all
would
be
lost.
Am
I
willing
to
show
my
face?
It
was
something
the
Teacher
had
strictly
forbidden.
Remy
was
the
only
one
who
knew
the
Teacher's
identity.
"Are
you
certain
you
want
Silas
to
carry
out
this
task?"
Remy
had
asked
the
Teacher
less
than
half
an
hour
ago,
upon
getting
orders
to
steal
the
keystone.
"I
myself
am
capable."
The
Teacher
was
resolute.
"Silas
served
us
well
with
the
four
Priory
members.
He
will
recover
the
keystone.
You
must
remain
anonymous.
If
others
see
you,
they
will
need
to
be
eliminated,
and
there
has
been
enough
killing
already.
Do
not
reveal
your
face."
My
face
will
change,
Remy
thought.
With
what
you've
promised
to
pay
me,
I
will
become
an
entirely
new
man.
Surgery
could
even
change
his
fingerprints,
the
Teacher
had
told
him.
Soon
he
would
be
free
another
unrecognizable,
beautiful
face
soaking
up
the
sun
on
the
beach.
"Understood,"
