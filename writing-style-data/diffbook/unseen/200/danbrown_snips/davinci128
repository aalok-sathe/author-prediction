feet
from
the
side
of
the
building.
As
the
traffic
lights
prepared
to
change,
Sophie
took
a
deep
breath
and
lobbed
the
bar
of
soap
out
into
the
night.
The
soap
plummeted
downward
toward
the
truck,
landing
on
the
edge
of
the
tarp,
and
sliding
downward
into
the
cargo
bay
just
as
the
traffic
light
turned
green.
"Congratulations,"
Sophie
said,
dragging
him
toward
the
door.
"You
just
escaped
from
the
Louvre."
Fleeing
the
men's

with
the
fire

hurried

as

leaving
the
Grand
Gallery
deserted.
"There's
an
emergency
stairwell
about
fifty
meters
back
into
the
Grand
Gallery,"
Sophie
said.
"Now
that
the
guards
are
leaving
the
perimeter,
we
can
get
out
of
here."
Langdon
decided
not
to
say
another
word
all
evening.
Sophie
Neveu
was
clearly
a
hell
of
a
lot
smarter
than
he
was.
The
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice,
it
is
said,
has
the
most
eccentric
history
of
any
building
in
Paris.
Built
over
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
temple
to
the
Egyptian
goddess
Isis,
