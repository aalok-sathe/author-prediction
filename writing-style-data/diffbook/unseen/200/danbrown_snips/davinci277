them
personally."
Collet
took
the
hint.
"Twenty
four
Rue
Haxo.
Right
away,
Captain."
He
hung
up
and
radioed
his
men.
Andre
Vernet
president
of
the
Paris
branch
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
lived
in
a
lavish
flat
above
the
bank.
Despite
his
plush
accommodations,
he
had
always
dreamed
of
owning
a
riverside
apartment
on
L'lle
Saint
Louis,
where
he
could
rub
shoulders
with
the
true
cognoscenti,
rather
than
here,
where
he
simply
met
the
filthy
rich.
When
I
retire,
Vernet
told
himself,
will
fill
my
cellar
with
rare
Bordeaux,
adorn
my
salon
with
a
Fragonard
and
perhaps
a
Boucher,
and
spend
my
days
hunting
for
antique
furniture
and
rare
books
in
the
Quartier
Latin.
Tonight,
Vernet
had
been
awake
only
six
and
a
half
minutes.
Even
so,
as
he
hurried
through
the
bank's
underground
corridor,
he
looked
as
if
his
personal
tailor
and
hairdresser
had
polished
him
to
a
fine
sheen.
Impeccably
dressed
in
a
silk
suit,
Vernet
sprayed
some
breath
spray
in
his
mouth
and
tightened
his
tie
as
he
walked.
No
stranger
to
being
awoken
to
attend
to
his
international
clients
arriving
from
different
time
zones,
Vernet
modeled
his
sleep
habits
after
the
Maasai
warriors
the
African
