you

help
me
understand.
Langdon
frowned.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Oh,
lame
saint.
!
He
wished
he
could
comprehend
the
message,
both
for
Sophie's
well
being
and
for
his
own.
Things
had
definitely
gotten
worse
since
he
first
laid
eyes
on
the
cryptic
words.
His
fake
leap
out
the
bathroom
window
was
not
going
to
help
Langdon's
popularity
with
Fache
one
bit.
Somehow
he
doubted

captain
of

would

the
humor
in

down
and

in
which
certain
lines

code
were
clues
as
to
how
to
decipher
the
other
lines.
"I've
been
thinking
about
the
numbers
all
night.
Sums,
quotients,
products.
I
don't
see
anything.
Mathematically,
they're
arranged
at
random.
Cryptographic
gibberish."
"And
yet
they're
all
part
of
the
Fibonacci
sequence.
That
can't
be
coincidence."
"It's
not.
Using
Fibonacci
numbers
was
my
grandfather's
way
of
waving
another
flag

in
English,
