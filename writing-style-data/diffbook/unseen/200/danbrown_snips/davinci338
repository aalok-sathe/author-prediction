the
Count
of
Aufflay,
it
was
one
of
Paris's
most
significant
historical
chateaux.
Complete
with
two
rectangular
lakes
and
gardens
designed
by
Le
Notre,
Chateau
Villette
was
more
of
a
modest
castle
than
a
mansion.
The
estate
fondly
had
become
known
as
la
Petite
Versailles.
Langdon
brought
the
armored
truck
to
a
shuddering
stop
at
the
foot
of
the
mile
long
driveway.
Beyond
the
imposing
security
gate,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing's
residence
rose
on
a
meadow
in
the

The

the

England.
Sophie
gave
the
misplaced
intercom
an
odd
look.
"And
if
someone
arrives
without
a
passenger?"
"Don't
ask."
Langdon
had
already
been
through
that
with
Teabing.
"He
prefers
things
the
way
they
are
at
home."
Sophie
rolled
down
her
window.
"Robert,
you'd
better
do
the
talking."
Langdon
shifted
his
position,
leaning
out
across
Sophie
to
press
the
intercom
button.
As
he
did,
an
alluring
whiff
