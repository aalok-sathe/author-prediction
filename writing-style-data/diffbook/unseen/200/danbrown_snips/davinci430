find
the
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon
was
too
groggy
to
consider
it.
"Robert,"
Sophie
said,
walking
to
the
wooden
box.
"What's
this?"
She
was
holding
the
small
Rose
inlay
he
had
removed
from
the
lid.
"It
covered
an
engraving
on
the
box.
I
think
the
text
might
tell
us
how
to
open
the
keystone."
Before
Sophie
and
Teabing
could
respond,
a
sea
of
blue
police
lights
and
sirens
erupted
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
began
snaking
up
the
half
mile
driveway.
Teabing
frowned.
"My
friends,
it
seems
we
have
a
decision
to
make.
And
we'd
better
make
it
fast."
Collet
and
his
agents
burst
through
the
front
door
of
Sir
Leigh
Teabing's
estate
with
their
guns
drawn.
Fanning
out,
they
began
searching
all
the
rooms
on
the
first
level.
They
found
a
bullet
hole
in
the
drawing
room
floor,
signs
of
a
struggle,
a
small
amount
of
blood,
a
strange,
barbed
leather
belt,
and
a
partially
used
roll
of
duct
tape.
The
entire
level
seemed
deserted.
Just
as
Collet
was
about
to
divide
his
men
to
search
the
basement
and
grounds
behind
the
house,
he
heard
voices
on
the
level
above
them.
"They're
upstairs!"
Rushing
up
the
wide
staircase,
