Dossiers
Secrets.
Every
Priory
historian
and
Grail
buff
had
read
the
Dossiers.
Cataloged

249,
the
Dossiers
Secrets
had
been
authenticated
by
many
specialists
and
incontrovertibly
confirmed
what
historians
had
suspected
for
a
long
time:
Priory
Grand
Masters
included
Leonardo
da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
Sir
Isaac
Newton,
Victor
Hugo,
and,
more
recently,
Jean
Cocteau,
the
famous
Parisian
artist.
Why
not
Jacques
Sauniere
?
Langdon's
incredulity
intensified
with
the
realization
that
he
had
been
slated
to
meet
Sauniere
tonight.
The
Priory
Grand
Master
called
a
meeting
with
me.
Why?
To
make
artistic
small
talk?
It
suddenly
seemed
unlikely.
After
all,
if
Langdon's
instincts
were
correct,
the
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion
had
just
transferred
the
brotherhood's
legendary
keystone
to
his
granddaughter
and
simultaneously
commanded
her
to
find
Robert
Langdon.
Inconceivable!
Langdon's
imagination
could
conjure
no
set
of
circumstances
that
would
explain
Sauniere's
behavior.
Even
if
Sauniere
feared
his
own
death,
there
were
three
senechaux
who
also
possessed
the
secret
and
therefore
guaranteed
the
Priory's
security.
Why
would
Sauniere
take
such
an
enormous
risk
giving
his
granddaughter
the
keystone,
especially
when
the
two
of
them
didn't
get
along?
And
why
involve
Langdon
a
total
stranger?
