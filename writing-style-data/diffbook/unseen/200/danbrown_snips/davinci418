that
sordid.
"Lieutenant?"
One
of
the
field
agents
came
running
over.
"We
found
a
car."
Collet
followed
the
agent
about
fifty
yards
past
the
driveway.
The
agent
pointed
to
a
wide
shoulder
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road.
There,
parked
in
the
brush,
almost
out
of
sight,
was
a
black
Audi.
It
had
rental
plates.
Collet
felt
the
hood.
Still
warm.
Hot
even.
"That
must
be
how
Langdon
got
here,"
Collet
said.
"Call
the
rental
company.
Find
out
if
it's
stolen."
"Yes,
sir."
Another
agent
waved
Collet
back
over

the
direction
of
the
fence.
"Lieutenant,
have
a
look
at
this."
He
handed
Collet
a
pair
of
night
vision
binoculars.
"The
grove
of
trees
near
the
top
of
the
driveway."
Collet
aimed
the
binoculars
up
the
hill
and
adjusted
the
image
intensifier
dials.
Slowly,
the
greenish
shapes
came
into
focus.
He
located
the
curve
of
the
driveway
and
slowly
followed
it
up,
reaching
the
grove
of
trees.
All
he
could
do
was
stare.
There,
shrouded
in
the
greenery,
was
an
armored
truck.
A
truck
identical
to
the
one
Collet
had
permitted
to
leave
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
earlier
tonight.
He
prayed
this
was
some
kind
of
bizarre
coincidence,
