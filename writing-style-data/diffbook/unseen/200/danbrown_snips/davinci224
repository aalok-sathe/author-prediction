small,
unimpressive
black
Fiat
sedan.
Aringarosa
recalled
a
day
when
all
Vatican
transports
were
big
luxury
cars
that
sported
grille
plate
medallions
and
flags
emblazoned
with
the
seal
of
the
Holy
See.
Those
days
are
gone.
Vatican
cars
were
now
less
ostentatious
and
almost
always
unmarked.
The
Vatican
claimed
this
was
to
cut
costs
to
better
serve
their
dioceses,
but
Aringarosa
suspected
it
was
more
of
a
security
measure.
The
world
had
gone
mad,
and
in
many
parts
of
Europe,
advertising
your
love
of
Jesus
Christ
was
like
painting
a
bull's
eye
on
the
roof
of
your
car.
Bundling
his
black
cassock
around
himself,
Aringarosa
climbed
into
the
back
seat
and
settled
in
for
the
long
drive
to
Castel
Gandolfo.
It
would
be
the
same
ride
he
had
taken
five
months
ago.
Last
year's
trip
to
Rome,
he
sighed.
The
longest
night
of
my
life.
Five
months
ago,
the
Vatican
had
phoned
to
request
Aringarosa's
immediate
presence
in
Rome.
They
offered
no
explanation.
Your
tickets
are
at
the
airport.
The
Holy
See
worked
hard
to
retain
a
veil
of
mystery,
even
for
its
highest
clergy.
The
mysterious
summons,
Aringarosa
suspected,
was
probably
a
photo
opportunity
for
the
Pope
and
other
