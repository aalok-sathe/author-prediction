Sophie
drank
her
tea
and
ate
a
scone,
feeling
the
welcome
effects
of
caffeine
and
food.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
was
beaming
as
he
awkwardly
paced
before
the
open
fire,
his
leg
braces
clicking
on
the
stone
hearth.
"The
Holy
Grail,"
Teabing
said,
his
voice
sermonic.
"Most
people
ask
me
only
where
it
is.
I
fear
that
is
a
question
I
may
never
answer."
He
turned
and
looked
directly
at
Sophie.
"However
the
far
more
relevant
question
is
this:
What
is
the
Holy
Grail?"
Sophie
sensed
a
rising
air
of
academic
anticipation
now
in
both
of
her
male
companions.
"To
fully
understand
the
Grail,"
Teabing
continued,
"we
must
first
understand
the
Bible.
How
well
do
you
know
the
New
Testament?"
Sophie
shrugged.
"Not
at
all,
really.
I
was
raised
by
a
man
who
worshipped
Leonardo
da
Vinci."
Teabing
looked
both
startled
and
pleased.
"An
enlightened
soul.
Superb!
Then
you
must
be
aware
that
Leonardo
was
one
of
the
keepers
of
the
secret
of
the
Holy
Grail.
And
he
hid
clues
in
his
art."
"Robert
told
me
as
much,
yes."
"And
Da
Vinci's
views
on
the
New
Testament?"
"I
have
no
idea."
Teabing's
eyes
turned
mirthful
as
he
motioned
to
the
bookshelf
