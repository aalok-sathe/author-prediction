through
of
the
five
knights
on
the
left.
Scrutinizing
these
first
tombs,
Sophie
noted
the
similarities
and
differences
between
them.
Every
knight
was
on
his
back,
but
three
of
the
knights
had
their
legs
extended
straight
out
while
two
had
their
legs
crossed.
The
oddity
seemed
to
have
no
relevance
to
the
missing
orb.
Examining
their
clothing,
Sophie
noted
that
two
of
the
knights
wore
tunics
over
their
armor,
while
the
other
three
wore
ankle
length
robes.
Again,
utterly
unhelpful.
Sophie
turned
her
attention
to
the
only
other
obvious
difference
their
hand
positions.
Two
knights
clutched
swords,
two
prayed,
and
one
had
his
arms
at
his
side.
After
a
long
moment
looking
at
the
hands,
Sophie
shrugged,
having
seen
no
hint
anywhere
of
a
conspicuously
absent
orb.
Feeling
the
weight
of
the
cryptex
in
her
sweater
pocket,
she
glanced
back
at
Langdon
and
Teabing.
The
men
were
moving
slowly,
still
only
at
the
third
knight,
apparently
having
no
luck
either.
In
no
mood
to
wait,
she
turned
away
from
them
toward
the
second
group
of
knights.
As
she
crossed
the
open
space,
she
quietly
recited
the
poem
she
had
read
so
many
times
now
that
it
was
committed
to
memory.
