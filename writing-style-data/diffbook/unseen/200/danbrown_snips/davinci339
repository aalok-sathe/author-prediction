Sophie's
perfume
filled
his
nostrils,
and
he
realized
how
close
they
were.
He
waited
there,
awkwardly
prone,
while
a
telephone
began
ringing
over
the
small
speaker.
Finally,
the
intercom
crackled
and
an
irritated
French
accent
spoke.
"Chateau
Villette.
Who
is
calling?"
"This
is
Robert
Langdon,"
Langdon
called
out,
sprawled
across
Sophie's
lap.
"I'm
a
friend
of
Sir
Leigh
Teabing.
I
need
his
help."
"My
master
is
sleeping.
As
was
I.
What
is
your
business
with
him?"
"It
is
a
private
matter.
One
of
great
interest
to
him."
"Then
I'm
sure
he
will
be
pleased
to
receive
you
in
the
morning."
Langdon
shifted
his
weight.
"It's
quite
important."
"As
is
Sir
Leigh's
sleep.
If
you
are
a
friend,
then
you
are
aware
he
is
in
poor
health."
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
had
suffered
from
polio
as
a
child
and
now
wore
leg
braces
and
walked
with
crutches,
but
Langdon
had
found
him
such
a
lively
and
colorful
man
on
his
last
visit
that
it
hardly
seemed
an
infirmity.
"If
you
would,
please
tell
him
I
have
uncovered
new
information
about
the
Grail.
Information
that
cannot
wait
until
morning."
There
was
a
long
pause.
Langdon
and
Sophie
waited,
the
truck
idling
loudly.
