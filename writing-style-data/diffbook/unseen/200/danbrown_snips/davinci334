wealthy
in
the
way
small
countries
were
wealthy.
A
descendant
of
Britain's
First
Duke
of
Lancaster,
Teabing
had
gotten
his
money
the
old
fashioned
way
he'd
inherited
it.
His
estate
outside
of
Paris
was
a
seventeenth
century
palace
with
two
private
lakes.
Langdon
had
first
met
Teabing
several
years
ago
through
the
British
Broadcasting
Corporation.
Teabing
had
approached
the
BBC
with
a
proposal
for
a
historical
documentary
in
which
he
would
expose
the
explosive
history
of
the
Holy
Grail
to
a
mainstream
television
audience.
The
BBC
producers
loved
Teabing's
hot
premise,
his
research,
and
his
credentials,
but
they
had
concerns
that
the
concept
was
so
shocking
and
hard
to
swallow
that
the
network
might
end
up
tarnishing
its
reputation
for
quality
journalism.
At
Teabing's
suggestion,
the
BBC
solved
its
credibility
fears
by
soliciting
three
cameos
from
respected
historians
from
around
the
world,
all
of
whom
corroborated
the
stunning
nature
of
the
Holy
Grail
secret
with
their
own
research.
Langdon
had
been
among
those
chosen.
The
BBC
had
flown
Langdon
to
Teabing's
Paris
estate
for
the
filming.
He
sat
before
cameras
in
Teabing's
opulent
drawing
room
and
shared
his
story,
admitting
his
initial
skepticism
on
hearing
of
the
alternate
Holy
Grail
