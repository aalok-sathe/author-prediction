he
moved
to
the
bedroom
where
his
father
lay
on
the
bed
in
a
drunken
stupor.
Without
a
word,
the
boy
stabbed
him
in
the
back.
His
father
cried
out
in
pain
and
tried
to
roll
over,
but
his
son
stabbed
him
again,
over
and
over
until
the
apartment
fell
quiet.
The
boy
fled
home
but
found
the
streets
of
Marseilles
equally
unfriendly.
His
strange
appearance
made
him
an
outcast
among
the
other
young
runaways,
and
he
was
forced
to
live
alone
in
the
basement
of
a

When
he
was

mocked
him
on
the
streets
and
attempted
to
steal
his
food.
The
girl
found
herself
pummeled
to
within
inches
of
her
life.
When
the
authorities
pulled
the
boy
off
her,
they
gave
him
an
ultimatum
leave
Marseilles
or
go
to
juvenile
prison.
The
boy
moved
down
the
coast
to
Toulon.
Over
time,
the
looks
of
pity
on
the
streets
turned
to
looks
of
fear.
The
boy
