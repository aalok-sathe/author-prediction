one
in
constant
conflict
with
the
Church."
As
Langdon
said
this,
an
odd
thought
popped
into
his
mind.
He
glanced
down
at
the
message
on
the
floor
again.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Oh,
lame
saint!
"Yes?"
Fache
said.
Langdon
weighed
his
words
carefully.
"I
was
just
thinking
that
Sauniere
shared
a
lot
of
spiritual
ideologies
with
Da
Vinci,
including
a
concern
over
the
Church's
elimination
of
the
sacred
feminine
from
modern
religion.
Maybe,
by
imitating
a
famous
Da

drawing,
Sauniere
was
simply

the
modern
Church's
demonization
of
the
goddess."

Sauniere
is
calling
the
Church

lame
saint
and

Draconian
devil?"
Langdon
had

and
yet
the
pentacle
seemed
to
endorse
the
idea
on
some
level.
"All
I
am
saying
is
that
Mr.
Sauniere
dedicated
his
life
to
studying
the
history
of
the
goddess,
and
nothing
has
done
more
to
erase
that
history
than
the
Catholic
Church.
It
seems
reasonable
that
Sauniere
might
have
chosen
to
express
his
disappointment
in
his
final
good
bye."
"Disappointment?"
Fache
demanded,
sounding
hostile
now.
"This
message
sounds
more
enraged
than
disappointed,
wouldn't
you
say?"
Langdon
was
reaching
