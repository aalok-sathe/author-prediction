"Did
Jesus
have
a
girlfriend?"
Her
grandfather
was
silent
for
several
moments.
"Would
it
be
so
bad
if
He
did?"
Sophie
considered
it
and
then
shrugged.
"I
wouldn't
mind."
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
was
still
talking.
"I
shan't
bore
you
with
the
countless
references
to
Jesus
and
Magdalene's
union.
That

been
explored
ad
nauseum

"The
woman
