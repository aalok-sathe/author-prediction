or
you
and
Sophie
are
next."
"It
was
a
car
accident,"
Sophie
stammered,
feeling
the
childhood
pain
welling
inside
her.
"An
accident!"
"Bedtime
stories
to
protect
your
innocence,"
Teabing
said.
"Consider
that
only
two
family
members
went
untouched
the
Priory's
Grand
Master
and
his
lone
granddaughter
the
perfect
pair
to
provide
the
Church
with
control
over
the
brotherhood.
I
can
only

Teabing
fired
back.
"You
want
proof
the
Priory
was
influenced?
The
new
millennium
has
arrived,
and
yet
the
world
remains
ignorant!
Is
that
not
proof
enough?"
In
the
echoes
of
Teabing's
words,
Sophie
heard
another
voice
speaking.
Sophie,
I
must
tell
you
the
truth
about
your
family.
She
realized
she
was
trembling.
Could
this
possibly
be
that
truth
her
grandfather
had
wanted
to
tell
her?
That
