paused
at
the
door,
looking
pale.
"But
of
course.
Like
most
Swiss
banks,
our
safe
deposit
boxes
are
attached
to
a
number,
not
a
name.
You
have
a
key
and
a
personal
account
number
known
only
to
you.
Your
key
is
only
half
of
your
identification.
Your
personal
account
number
is
the
other
half.
Otherwise,
if
you
lost
your
key,
anyone
could
use
it."
Sophie
hesitated.

gave

a
calm

will
be
in

Leaving,
the
banker
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
twisted
a
heavy
lock,
sealing
them
inside.
Across
town,
Collet
was
standing
in
the
Gare
du
Nord
train
terminal
when
his
phone
rang.
It
was
Fache.
"Interpol
got
a
tip,"
he
said.
"Forget
the
train.
Langdon
and
Neveu
just
walked
into
the
Paris
branch
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich.
I
want
your
men
over
there
right
away."
"Any
leads
yet
on
what
Sauniere
was
trying
to
tell
Agent
Neveu
and
Robert
Langdon?"
Fache's
tone
was
cold.
"If
you
arrest
them,
Lieutenant
Collet,
then
I
can
ask
