meeting
rooms,
and
offices.
The
second,
eighth,
and
sixteenth
floors
contain
chapels,
ornamented
with
mill
work
and
marble.
The
seventeenth
floor
is
entirely
residential.
Men
enter
the
building
through
the
main
doors
on
Lexington
Avenue.
Women
enter
through
a
side
street
and
are
"acoustically
and
visually
separated"
from
the
men
at
all
times
within
the
building.
Earlier
this
evening,
within
the
sanctuary
of
his
penthouse
apartment,
Bishop
Manuel
Aringarosa
had
packed
a
small
travel
bag
and
dressed
in
a
traditional
black
cassock.
Normally,
he
would
have
wrapped
a
purple
cincture
around
his
waist,
but
tonight
he
would
be
traveling
among
the
public,
and
he
preferred
not
to
draw
attention
to
his
high
office.
Only
those
with
a
keen
eye
would
notice
his
14
karat
gold
bishop's
ring
with
purple
amethyst,
large
diamonds,
and
hand
tooled
mitre
crozier
applique.
Throwing
the
travel
bag
over
his
shoulder,
he
said
a
silent
prayer
and
left
his
apartment,
descending
to
the
lobby
where
his
driver
was
waiting
to
take
him
to
the
airport.
Now,
sitting
aboard
a
commercial
airliner
bound
for
Rome,
Aringarosa
gazed
out
the
window
at
the
dark
Atlantic.
The
sun
had
already
set,
but
Aringarosa
knew
his
own
star
was
on
