Langdon
opened
his
mouth
to
explain
the
bizarre
error,
but
Sophie
flashed
him
a
silencing
glare
that
lasted
only
an
instant.
Her
green
eyes
sent
a
crystal
clear
message.
Don
't
ask
questions.
Just
do
it.
Bewildered,
Langdon
punched
in
the
extension
on
the
slip
of
paper:
454.
Sophie's
outgoing
message
immediately
cut
off,
and
Langdon
heard
an
electronic
voice
announce
in
French:
"You
have
one
new
message."
Apparently,
454
was
Sophie's
remote
access
code
for
picking
up
her
messages
while
away
from
home.
I'm
picking
up
this
woman's
messages?
Langdon
could
hear
the
tape
rewinding
now.
Finally,
it
stopped,
and
the
machine
engaged.
Langdon
listened
as
the
message
began
to
play.
Again,
the
voice
on
the
line
was
Sophie's.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
the
message
began
in
a
fearful
whisper.
"Do
not
react
to
this
message.
Just
listen
calmly.
You
are
in
danger
right
now.
Follow
my
directions
very
closely."
Silas
sat
behind
the
wheel
of
the
black
Audi
the
Teacher
had
arranged
for
him
and
gazed
out
at
the
great
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice.
Lit
from
beneath
by
banks
of
floodlights,
the
church's
two
bell
towers
rose
like
stalwart
sentinels
above
the
building's
long
body.
On
either
flank,
a
shadowy
