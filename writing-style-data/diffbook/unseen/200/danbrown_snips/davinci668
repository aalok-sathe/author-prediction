mystery.
"I'd
be
happy
to
show"
The
docent's
voice
trailed
off.
My
first
code,
Sophie
thought,
moving
alone,
in
a
trance,
toward
the
encoded
archway.
Having
handed
the
rosewood
box
to
Langdon,
she
could
feel
herself
momentarily
forgetting
all
about
the
Holy
Grail,
the
Priory
of
Sion,
and
all
the
mysteries
of
the
past
day.
When
she
arrived
beneath
the
encoded
ceiling
and
saw
the
symbols
above
her,
the
memories
came
flooding
back.
She
was
recalling
her
first
visit
here,
and
strangely,
the
memories
conjured
an
unexpected
sadness.
She
was
a
little
girl
a
year
or
so
after
her
family's
death.
Her
grandfather
had
brought
her
to
Scotland
on
a
short
vacation.
They
had
come
to
see
Rosslyn
Chapel
before
going
back
to
Paris.
It
was
late
evening,
and
the
chapel
was
closed.
But
they
were
still
inside.
"Can
we
go
home,
Grand
pere?"
Sophie
begged,
feeling
tired.
"Soon,
dear,
very
soon."
His
voice
was
melancholy.
"I
have
one
last
thing
I
need
to
do
here.
How
about
if
you
wait
in
the
car?"
"You're
doing
another
big
person
thing?"
He
nodded.
"I'll
be
fast.
I
promise."
"Can
I
do
the
archway
code
again?
That
was
fun."
"I
don't
know.
