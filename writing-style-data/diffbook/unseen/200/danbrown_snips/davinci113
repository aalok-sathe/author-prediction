have
been
waiting
for
years
to
tell
you.
Waiting
for
the
right
moment,
but
now
time
has
run
out.
Call
me
at
the
Louvre.
As
soon
as
you
get
this.
I'll
wait
here
all
night.
I
fear
we
both
may
be
in
danger.
There's
so
much
you
need
to
know."
The
message
ended.
In
the
silence,
Sophie
stood

for
what
felt
like
minutes.
As
she

message,
only
one
possibility
made

ill
and
had
decided
to
attempt
any
ploy
he
could
think
of
to
get
Sophie
to
visit
him
one
last
time.
If
so,
he
had
chosen
wisely.
My
family.
Now,
standing
in
the
darkness
of
the
Louvre
men's
room,
Sophie
could
hear
the
echoes
of
this
afternoon's
phone
message.
Sophie,
we
both
may
be
in
danger.
Call
me.
She
had
not
called
him.
Nor
had
she
planned
to.
Now,
however,
her
skepticism
had
been
deeply
challenged.
Her
grandfather
lay
murdered
inside
his
own
museum.
And
he
had
written
a
code
on
