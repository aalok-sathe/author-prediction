row
of
sleek
buttresses
jutted
out
like
the
ribs
of
a
beautiful
beast.
The
heathens
used
a
house
of
God
to
conceal
their
keystone.
Again
the
brotherhood
had
confirmed
their
legendary
reputation
for
illusion
and
deceit.
Silas
was
looking
forward
to
finding
the
keystone
and
giving
it
to
the
Teacher
so
they
could
recover
what
the
brotherhood
had
long
ago
stolen
from
the
faithful.
How
powerful
that
will
make
Opus
Dei.
Parking
the
Audi
on
the
deserted
Place
Saint
Sulpice,
Silas
exhaled,
telling
himself
to
clear
his
mind
for
the
task
at
hand.
His
broad
back
still
ached
from
the
corporal
mortification
he
had
endured
earlier
today,
and
yet
the
pain
was
inconsequential
compared
with
the
anguish
of
his
life
before
Opus
Dei
had
saved
him.
Still,
the
memories
haunted
his
soul.
Release
your
hatred,
Silas
commanded
himself.
Forgive
those
who
trespassed
against
you.
Looking
up
at
the
stone
towers
of
Saint
Sulpice,
Silas
fought
that
familiar
undertow
that
force
that
often
dragged
his
mind
back
in
time,
locking
him
once
again
in
the
prison
that
had
been
his
world
as
a
young
man.
The
memories
of
purgatory
came
as
they
always
did,
like
a
tempest
to
his
senses
the
