Abu
Yusuf
Ismail
al
Kindi
protected
his
secrets
with
an
ingeniously
conceived
polyalphabetic
substitution
cipher.
Da
Vinci,
however,
eschewed
mathematics
and
cryptology
for
a
mechanical
solution.
The
cryptex.
A
portable
container
that
could
safeguard
letters,
maps,
diagrams,
anything
at
all.
Once
information
was
sealed
inside
the
cryptex,
only
the
individual
with
the
proper
password
could
access
it.
"We
require
a
password,"
Sophie
said,
pointing
out
the
lettered
dials.
"A
cryptex
works
much
like
a
bicycle's
combination
lock.
If
you
align
the
dials
in
the
proper
position,
the
lock
slides
open.
This
cryptex
has
five
lettered
dials.
When
you
rotate
them
to
their
proper
sequence,
the
tumblers
inside
align,
and
the
entire
cylinder
slides
apart."
"And
inside?"
"Once
the
cylinder
slides
apart,
you
have
access
to
a
hollow
central
compartment,
which
can
hold
a
scroll
of
paper
on
which
is
the
information
you
want
to
keep
private."
Langdon
looked
incredulous.
"And
you
say
your
grandfather
built
these
for
you
when
you
were
younger?"
"Some
smaller
ones,
yes.
A
couple
times
for
my
birthday,
he
gave
me
a
cryptex
and
told
me
a
riddle.
The
answer
to
the
riddle
was
the
password
to
the
cryptex,
and
once
I
figured
it
out,
