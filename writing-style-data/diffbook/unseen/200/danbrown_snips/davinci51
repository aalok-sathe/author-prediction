to
organize
their
Olympiads.
Nowadays,
few
people
realized
that
the
four
year
schedule
of
modern
Olympic
Games
still
followed
the
cycles
of
Venus.
Even
fewer
people
knew
that
the
five
pointed
star
had
almost
become
the
official
Olympic
seal
but
was
modified
at
the
last
moment
its
five
points
exchanged
for
five
intersecting
rings
to
better
reflect
the
games'
spirit
of
inclusion
and
harmony.
"Mr.
Langdon,"
Fache
said
abruptly.
"Obviously,
the
pentacle
must
also
relate
to
the
devil.
Your
American
horror
movies
make
that
point
clearly."
Langdon
frowned.
Thank
you,
Hollywood.
The
five
pointed
star
was
now
a
virtual
cliche
in
Satanic
serial
killer
movies,
usually
scrawled
on
the
wall
of
some
Satanist's
apartment
along
with
other
alleged
demonic
symbology.
Langdon
was
always
frustrated
when
he
saw
the
symbol
in
this
context;
the
pentacle's
true
origins
were
actually
quite
godly.
"I
assure
you,"
Langdon
said,
"despite
what
you
see
in
the
movies,
the
pentacle's
demonic
interpretation
is
historically
inaccurate.
The
original
feminine
meaning
is
correct,
but
the
symbolism
of
the
pentacle
has
been
distorted
over
the
millennia.
In
this
case,
through
bloodshed."
"I'm
not
sure
I
follow."
Langdon
glanced
at
Fache's
crucifix,
uncertain
how
to
phrase
his
next
point.
"The
