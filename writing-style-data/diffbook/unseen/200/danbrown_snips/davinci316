is
indeed
the
keystone,
your
grandfather's
access
to
it
implies
he
was
exceptionally
powerful
within
the
Priory
of
Sion.
He
would
have
to
have
been
one
of
the
highest
four
members."
Sophie
sighed.
"He
was
powerful
in
a
secret
society.
I'm
certain
of
it.
I
can
only
assume
it
was
the
Priory.
Langdon
did
a
double
take.
"You
knew
he
was
in
a
secret
society?"
"I
saw
some
things
I
wasn't
supposed
to
see
ten
years
ago.
We
haven't
spoken
since."
She
paused.
"My
grandfather
was
not
only
a

the
group
I

what
she
had
just
said.
"Grand
Master?
But
there's
no
way
you
could
know
that!"
"I'd
rather
not
talk
about
it."
Sophie
looked
away,
her
expression
as
determined
as
it
was
pained.
Langdon
sat
in
stunned
silence.
Jacques
Sauniere?
Grand
Master?
Despite
the
astonishing
repercussions
if
it
were
true,
Langdon
had
the
eerie
sensation
it
almost
made
perfect
sense.
After
all,
previous
Priory
Grand
Masters
had
also
been
distinguished
public
figures
with
artistic
souls.
Proof
of
that
fact
had
been
uncovered
years
ago
in
Paris's
Bibliotheque
Nationale
in
papers
that
became
known
as
Les
