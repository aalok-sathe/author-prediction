means
Fache
is
lying.
Why,
Sophie
could
not
begin
to
imagine,
but
that
was
hardly
the
issue
at
this
point.
The
fact
remained
that
Bezu
Fache
was
determined
to
put
Robert
Langdon
behind
bars
tonight,
at
any
cost.
Sophie
needed
Langdon
for
herself,
and
it
was
this
dilemma
that
left
Sophie
only
one
logical
conclusion.

Embassy.
Turning
toward
the

Sophie
gazed
through

Or

Fache
had
looked
distressed

talking
to
the
director
of
Cryptology
on
the
phone.
After
hanging
up,
he
had
marched
over

line.
Now
Collet
