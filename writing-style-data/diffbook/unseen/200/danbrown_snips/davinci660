the
Priory's
final
secret
had
been
unveiled
in
the
same
way
Sauniere
had
spoken
to
them
from
the
beginning.
Simple
verse.
Four
explicit
lines
that
pointed
without
a
doubt
to
this
very
spot.
In
addition
to
identifying
Rosslyn
by
name,
the
verse
made
reference
to
several
of
the
chapel's
renowned
architectural
features.
Despite
the
clarity
of
Sauniere's
final
revelation,
Langdon
had
been
left
feeling
more
off
balance
than
enlightened.
To
him,
Rosslyn
Chapel
seemed
far
too
obvious
a
location.
For
centuries,
this
stone
chapel
had
echoed
with

had
turned
to

decades
when
ground

an
astonishing

massive
subterranean
chamber.
Not
only
did
this
deep
vault
dwarf
the
chapel
atop
it,
but
it
appeared
to
have
no
entrance
or
exit.
Archaeologists
petitioned
to
begin
blasting
through
the
bedrock
to
reach
the
mysterious
chamber,
but
the
Rosslyn
Trust
expressly
forbade
any
excavation
of
the
sacred
site.
Of
course,
this
only
fueled
the
fires
of
speculation.
What
was
the
Rosslyn
Trust
trying
to
hide?
Rosslyn
had
now
become
a
pilgrimage
site
for
mystery
seekers.
Some
