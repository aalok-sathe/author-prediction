garden
is
outside
the
abbey
walls.
A
very
public
place."
Langdon
had
once
visited
the
abbey's
famous
College
Garden
a
small
fruit
orchard
and
herb
garden
left
over
from
the
days
when
monks
grew
natural
pharmacological
remedies
here.
Boasting
the
oldest
living
fruit
trees
in

tourists
to

"The

to
go
through
the
Chapter
House
to
the
south
exit,"
Sophie
said.
"Maybe
from
the
exit
we
would
have
a
view
of
the
garden?
That
way
we
could

The
