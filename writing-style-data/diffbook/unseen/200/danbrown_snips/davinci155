peal
of
thunder,
a
career's
worth
of
symbology
and
history
came
crashing
down
around
him.
Everything
Jacques
Sauniere
had
done
tonight
suddenly
made
perfect
sense.
Langdon's
thoughts
raced
as
he
tried
to
assemble
the
implications
of
what
this
all
meant.
Wheeling,
he
stared
back
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come.
Is
there
time
?
He
knew
it
didn't
matter.
Without
hesitation,
Langdon
broke
into
a
sprint
back
toward
the
stairs.
Kneeling
in
the
first
pew,
Silas
pretended
to
pray
as
he
scanned
the
layout
of
the
sanctuary.
Saint
Sulpice,
like
most
churches,
had
been
built
in
the
shape
of
a
giant
Roman
cross.
Its
long
central
section
the
nave
led
directly
to
the
main
altar,
where
it
was
transversely
intersected
by
a
shorter
section,
known
as
the
transept.
The
intersection
of
nave
and
transept
occurred
directly
beneath
the
main
cupola
and
was
considered
the
heart
of
the
church
her
most
sacred
and
mystical
point.
Not
tonight,
Silas
thought.
Saint
Sulpice
hides
her
secrets
elsewhere.
Turning
his
head
to
the
right,
he
gazed
into
the
south
transept,
toward
the
open
area
of
floor
beyond
the
end
of
the
pews,
to
the
object
his
victims
had
described.
There
it
is.
