Sophie
was
surprised
she
had
not
spotted
the
linguistic
ties
immediately.
Even
so,
Langdon's
claim
still
made
no
sense
to
her.
"I
thought
the
Holy
Grail
was
a
cup.
You
just
told
me
the
Sangreal
is
a
collection
of
documents
that
reveals

secret."
"Yes,
but
the
Sangreal
documents
are
only
half
of
the

treasure.
They
are
buried
with
the

thought,
was
the
cup
that

drank
from
at
the
Last
Supper
and
with
which
Joseph
of

later
caught
His
blood
at
the
crucifixion.
"The
Holy
Grail
is
the
Cup
of
Christ,"
she
said.
"How
much
simpler
could
it
be?"
"Sophie,"
Langdon
whispered,
leaning
toward
her
now,
"according
to
the
Priory
of
Sion,
the
Holy
Grail
is
not
a
cup
at
all.
They
claim
the
Grail
legend
that
of
a

is
actually
an
ingeniously
conceived
allegory.
That

that
