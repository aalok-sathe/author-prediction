no

day.
Grasping
the
buckle,
he
cinched
it
one
notch
tighter,
wincing
as
the
barbs
dug
deeper
into
his
flesh.
Exhaling
slowly,
he
savored
the
cleansing
ritual
of
his
pain.
Pain
is
good,
Silas
whispered,
repeating
the
sacred
mantra
of
Father
Josemaria
Escriva
the
Teacher
of
all
Teachers.
Although
Escriva
had
died
in
1975,
his
wisdom
lived

He
whipped
it
over
his
shoulder
again,
slashing
at
his
flesh.
Again
and

he
lashed.
Castigo
corpus

Finally,
he
felt
the
blood
begin
