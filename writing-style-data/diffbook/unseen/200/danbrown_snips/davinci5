his
female
students
describe
as
'chocolate
for
the
ears.'
The
hall
erupted
in
laughter.
Langdon
forced
an
awkward
smile.
He
knew
what
came
next
some
ridiculous
line
about
"Harrison
Ford
in
Harris
tweed"
and
because
this
evening
he
had
figured
it
was
finally
safe
again
to
wear
his
Harris
tweed
and
Burberry
turtleneck,
he
decided
to
take
action.
"Thank
you,
Monique,"
Langdon
said,
standing
prematurely
and
edging
her
away
from
the
podium.
"Boston
Magazine
clearly
has
a
gift
for
fiction."
He
turned
to
the
audience
with
an
embarrassed
sigh.
"And
if
I
find
which
one
of
you
provided
that
article,
I'll
have
the
consulate
deport
you."
The
crowd
laughed.
"Well,
folks,
as
you
all
know,
I'm
here
tonight
to
talk
about
the
power
of
symbols"
The
ringing
of
Langdon's
hotel
phone
once
again
broke
the
silence.
Groaning
in
disbelief,
he
picked
up.
"Yes?"
As
expected,
it
was
the
concierge.
"Mr.
Langdon,
again
my
apologies.
I
am
calling
to
inform
you
that
your
guest
is
now
en
route
to
your
room.
I
thought
I
should
alert
you."
Langdon
was
wide
awake
now.
"You
sent
someone
to
my
room?"
"I
apologize,
monsieur,
but
a
man
like
this
I
cannot
presume
the
authority
