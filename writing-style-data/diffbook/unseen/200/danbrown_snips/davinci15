had
probably
taken
all
of
five
seconds.
As
the
Citroen
accelerated
southward
across
the
city,
the
illuminated
profile
of
the
Eiffel
Tower
appeared,
shooting
skyward
in
the
distance
to
the
right.
Seeing
it,
Langdon
thought
of
Vittoria,
recalling
their
playful
promise
a
year
ago
that
every
six
months
they
would
meet
again
at
a
different
romantic
spot
on
the
globe.
The
Eiffel
Tower,
Langdon
suspected,
would
have
made
their
list.
Sadly,
he
last
kissed
Vittoria
in
a
noisy
airport
in
Rome
more

"She
is
lovely,
no?"
The
agent
motioned
through
the

"Have

mounted
her?"
Langdon
rolled
his
eyes.
"No,
I
haven't
climbed
the
tower."
"She
is
the
symbol
of
France.
I
think
she
is
perfect."
Langdon
nodded
absently.
Symbologists
often
remarked
that
France
a
country
renowned
for
machismo,
womanizing,
and
diminutive
insecure
leaders
like
Napoleon
and
Pepin
the
Short
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
apt
national
emblem
than
a
thousand
foot
phallus.
When
they
reached
the
intersection
at
Rue
de
Rivoli,
the
traffic
light
was
red,
but
