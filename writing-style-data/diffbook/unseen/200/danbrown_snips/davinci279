swirled
into
the
room
like
a
warm
breeze.
"Good
evening,"
he
said,
his
eyes
finding
his
clients.
"I
am
Andre
Vernet.
How
can
I
be
of

The
rest
of
the
sentence
lodged
somewhere
beneath
his
Adam's
apple.
The
woman
before
him
was
as
unexpected
a
visitor
as
Vernet
had
ever
had.
"I'm
sorry,
do
we
know
each
other?"
Sophie
asked.
She
did
not
recognize
the
banker,
but
he
for
a
moment
looked
as
if
he'd
seen
a
ghost.
"No,"
the
bank
president
fumbled.
"I
don't
believe
so.
Our
services
are
anonymous."
He
exhaled
and
forced
a
calm
smile.
"My
assistant

Sophie
replied,
watching
the
man
closely.
His
uneasiness
seemed
more
evident
now.
"Really?
Your
grandfather
gave
you
the
key
but
failed
to
give
you
the
account
number?"
"I
don't
think
he
had
time,"
Sophie
said.
"He
was
murdered
tonight."
Her
words
sent
the
man
staggering
backward.
"Jacques
Sauniere
is
dead?"
he
demanded,
his
eyes
filling
with
horror.
"But
how?!"
Now
it
was
Sophie
who
reeled,
numb
with
shock.
"You
knew
my
grandfather?"
