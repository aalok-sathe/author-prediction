the
Order
of
the
Poor
Knights
of
Christ
and
the
Temple
of
Solomon."
Langdon
paused.
"More
commonly
known
as
the
Knights
Templar."
Sophie
glanced
up
with
a
surprised
look
of
recognition.
Langdon
had
lectured
often
enough
on
the
Knights
Templar
to
know
that
almost
everyone
on
earth
had
heard
of
them,
at
least
abstractedly.
For
academics,
the
Templars'
history
was
a
precarious
world
where
fact,
lore,
and
misinformation
had
become
so
intertwined
that
extracting
a
pristine
truth
was
almost
impossible.
Nowadays,
Langdon
hesitated
even
to
mention
the
Knights
Templar
while
lecturing
because
it
invariably
led
to
a
barrage
of
convoluted
inquiries
into
assorted
conspiracy
theories.
Sophie
already
looked
troubled.
"You're
saying
the
Knights
Templar
were
founded
by
the
Priory
of
Sion
to
retrieve
a
collection
of
secret
documents?
I
thought
the
Templars
were
created
to
protect
the
Holy
Land."
"A
common
misconception.
The
idea
of
protection
of
pilgrims
was
the
guise
under
which
the
Templars
ran
their
mission.
Their
true
goal
in
the
Holy
Land
was
to
retrieve
the
documents
from
beneath
the
ruins
of
the
temple."
"And
did
they
find
them?"
Langdon
grinned.
"Nobody
knows
for
sure,
but
the
one
thing
on
which
all
academics
agree
is
this:
The
