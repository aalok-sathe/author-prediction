on
the
floor.
I
wouldn't
have
given
it
a
second
thought
except
the
rungs
were
worn
and
muddy.
This
ladder
gets
regular
use.
The
height
of
the
hayloft
matched
the
ladder,
so
I
raised
it
and
climbed
up
to
have
a
look."
Collet's
eyes
climbed
the
ladder's
steep
incline
to
the
soaring
hayloft.
Someone
goes
up
there
regularly?
From
down
here,
the
loft
appeared
to
be
a
deserted
platform,
and
yet
admittedly
most
of
it
was
invisible
from
this
line
of
sight.
A
senior
PTS
agent
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
ladder,
looking
down.
"You'll
definitely
want
to
see
this,
Lieutenant,"
he
said,
waving
Collet
up
with
a
latex
gloved
hand.
Nodding
tiredly,
Collet
walked
over
to
the
base
of
the
old
ladder
and
grasped
the
bottom
rungs.
The
ladder
was
an
antique
tapered
design
and
narrowed
as
Collet
ascended.
As
he
neared
the
top,
Collet
almost
lost
his
footing
on
a
thin
rung.
The
barn
below
him
spun.
Alert
now,
he
moved
on,
finally
reaching
the
top.
The
agent
above
him
reached
out,
offering
his
wrist.
Collet
grabbed
it
and
made
the
awkward
transition
onto
the
platform.
"It's
over
there,"
the
PTS
agent
said,
pointing
deep
into
the
