of
his
agents
on
the
way.
The
men
crossed
the
rear
lawn
and
arrived
breathless
at
the
front
of
a
weathered
gray
barn.
Even
before
they
entered,
Collet
could
hear
the
fading
sounds
of
a
car
engine.
He
drew
his
weapon,
rushed
in,
and
flicked
on
the
lights.
The
right
side
of
the
barn
was
a
rudimentary
workshop
lawn
mowers,
automotive
tools,
gardening
supplies.
A
familiar
intercom
panel
hung
on
the
wall
nearby.
One
of
its
buttons
was
flipped
down,
transmitting.
GUEST
BEDROOM
II.
Collet
wheeled,
anger
brimming.
They
lured
us
upstairs
with
the
intercom!
Searching
the
other
side
of
the
barn,
he
found
a
long
line
of
horse
stalls.
No
horses.
Apparently
the
owner
preferred
a
different
kind
of
horsepower;
the
stalls
had
been
converted
into
an
impressive
automotive
parking
facility.
The
collection
was
astonishing
a
black
Ferrari,
a
pristine
Rolls
Royce,
an
antique
Astin
Martin
sports
coupe,
a
vintage
Porsche
356.
The
last
stall
was
empty.
Collet
ran
over
and
saw
oil
stains
on
the
stall
floor.
They
can't
get
off
the
compound.
The
driveway
and
gate
were
barricaded
with
two
patrol
cars
to
prevent
this
very
situation.
"Sir?"
The
agent
pointed
down
the
length
of
the
stalls.
