down
the
hallway.
Lieutenant
Collet
stood
alone
at
the
foot
of
Leigh
Teabing's
driveway
and
gazed
up
at
the
massive
house.
Isolated.
Dark.
Good
ground
cover.
Collet
watched
his
half
dozen
agents
spreading
silently
out
along
the
length
of
the
fence.
They
could
be
over
it
and
have
the
house
surrounded
in
a
matter
of
minutes.
Langdon
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
ideal
spot
for
Collet's
men
to
make
a
surprise
assault.
Collet
was
about
to
call
Fache
himself
when
at
last
his
phone
rang.
Fache
sounded
not
nearly
as
pleased
with
the
developments
as
Collet
would
have
imagined.
"Why
didn't
someone
tell
me
we
had
a
lead
on
Langdon?"
"You
were
on
a
phone
call
and
"Where
exactly
are
you,
Lieutenant
Collet?"
Collet
gave
him
the
address.
"The
estate
belongs
to
a
British
national
named
Teabing.
Langdon
drove
a
fair
distance
to
get
here,
and
the
vehicle
is
inside
the
security
gate,
with
no
signs
of
forced
entry,
so
chances
are
good
that
Langdon
knows
the
occupant."
"I'm
coming
out,"
Fache
said.
"Don't
make
a
move.
I'll
handle
this
personally."
Collet's
jaw
dropped.
"But
Captain,
you're
twenty
minutes
away!
We
should
act
immediately.
I
have
him
staked
out.
