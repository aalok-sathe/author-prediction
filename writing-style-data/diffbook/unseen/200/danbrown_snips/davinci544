Wren
would
know
that.
Considering
it
was
his
family
that
uncovered
that
fact.
An
uneasy
silence
fell.
It
was
broken
by
the
sound
of
a
door
slamming
out
in
the
annex.
"That
must
be
Father
Knowles,"
Teabing
said.
"Perhaps
you
should
go
see?"
The
altar
boy
looked
doubtful
but
stalked
back
toward
the
annex,
leaving
Langdon,
Sophie,
and
Teabing
to
eye
one
another
gloomily.
"Leigh,"
Langdon
whispered.
"No
bodies?
What
is
he
talking
about?"
Teabing
looked
distraught.
"I
don't
know.
I
always
thought
certainly,
this
must
be
the
place.
I
can't
imagine
he
knows
what
he
is
talking
about.
It
makes
no
sense
!
"Can
I
see
the
poem
again?"
Langdon
said.
Sophie
pulled
the
cryptex
from
her
pocket
and
carefully
handed
it
to
him.
Langdon
unwrapped
the
vellum,
holding
the
cryptex
in
his
hand
while
he
examined
the
poem.
"Yes,
the
poem
definitely
references
a
tomb.
Not
an
effigy."
"Could
the
poem
be
wrong?"
Teabing
asked.
"Could
Jacques
Sauniere
have
made
the
same
mistake
I
just
did?"
Langdon
considered
it
and
shook
his
head.
"Leigh,
you
said
it
yourself.
This
church
was
built
by
Templars,
the
military
arm
of
the
Priory.
Something
tells
me
the
Grand
Master
of
the
