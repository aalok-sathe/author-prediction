when
he
was
about
to
give
her
a
challenge.
"If
you
can
keep
my
key
a
secret,
and
never
talk
about
it
ever
again,
to
me
or
anybody,
then
someday
I
will
give
it
to
you."
Sophie
couldn't
believe
her
ears.
"You
will?"
"I
promise.
When
the
time
comes,
the
key
will
be
yours.
It
has
your
name

Granddaughters
always
have
secret
initials
that
only
their
grandfathers
know."
"PS.?"
He
tickled
her.
"Princesse
Sophie.
She
giggled.
"I'm
not
a
princess!"
He
winked.
"You
are
to
me."
From
that
day
on,
they
never
again
spoke
of
the
key.
And
she
became
his
Princess
Sophie.
Inside
the
Salle
des
Etats,
Sophie
stood
in
silence
and
endured
the
sharp
pang
of
loss.
"The
initials,"
Langdon
whispered,
eyeing
her
strangely.
"Have
you
seen
them?"
Sophie
sensed

grandfather's
voice
whispering
in
the
corridors
of
the
museum.
