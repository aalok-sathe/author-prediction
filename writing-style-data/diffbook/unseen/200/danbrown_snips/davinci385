call."
Aringarosa
quickly
severed
the
connection.
As
the
receptionist
hung
up
the
receiver,
he
wondered
why
Aringarosa's
phone
connection
sounded
so
crackly.
The
bishop's
daily
schedule
showed
him
in
New
York
this
weekend,
and
yet
he
sounded
a
world
away.
The
receptionist
shrugged
it
off.
Bishop
Aringarosa
had
been
acting
very
strangely
the
last

months.
My
cellular
phone
must
not
have
been

Aringarosa

I'll
be
on
the
ground
before
dawn.
Aringarosa
had
a
chartered
turbo
prop
awaiting
him
here
for
the
short
flight
to
France.
Commercial
carriers
were
not
an
option
at
this
hour,
especially
considering
the
contents
of
his
briefcase.
The
line
began
to
ring.
A
female
voice
answered.
"Direction
Centrale
Police
Judidaire.
Aringarosa
felt
himself
hesitate.
This
was
unexpected.
"Ah,
yes
I
was
asked
to
call
this
number?"
"Qui
