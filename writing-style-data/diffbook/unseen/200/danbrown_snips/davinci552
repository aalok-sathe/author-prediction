I
have
shared
with
others.
Others
who
know
more
than
you.
You
are
not
even
looking
in
the
right
place.
The
tomb
you
seek
is
in
another
location
entirely!"
Teabing
felt
panicked.
What
is
he
saying!
"Why
do
you
want
the
Grail?"
Langdon
demanded.
"To
destroy
it?
Before
the
End
of
Days?"
Remy
called
to
the
monk.
"Silas,
take
the
keystone
from
Mr.
Langdon."
As
the
monk
advanced,
Langdon
stepped
back,
raising
the
keystone
high,
looking
fully
prepared
to
hurl
it
at
the

"I
would
rather
break

Langdon
said,
"than
see
it

hands."
Teabing
now
felt
a
wave
of

He
could
see
his
life's
work
evaporating
before
his
eyes.
All
his
dreams

to
be
shattered.
"Robert,
no!"
Teabing
exclaimed.
"Don't!
That's
the
Grail
you're
holding!
Remy
would
never
shoot
me.
We've
known
each
other
for
ten
Remy
aimed
at
the
ceiling
and
fired
the
Medusa.
The
blast
was
enormous
for
such
a
small
weapon,
the
gunshot
echoing
like
thunder
inside
the
stone
chamber.
Everyone
froze.
"I
am
not
playing
games,"
Remy
said.
"The
next
one
is
in
his
back.
Hand
the
keystone
to
Silas."
Langdon
reluctantly
held
out
the
cryptex.
Silas
stepped
forward
