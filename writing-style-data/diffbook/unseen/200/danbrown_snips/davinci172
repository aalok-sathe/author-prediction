A
place
where
forgotten
histories
emerged
from
the
shadows.
Slowly,
as
if
moving
underwater,
Langdon
turned
his
head
and
gazed
through
the
reddish
haze
toward
the
Mona
Lisa.
The
fleur
de
lis
the
flower
of
Lisa
the
Mona
Lisa.
It
was
all
intertwined,
a
silent
symphony
echoing
the
deepest
secrets
of
the
Priory
of
Sion
and
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
A
few
miles
away,
on
the
riverbank
beyond
Les
Invalides,
the
bewildered
driver
of
a
twin
bed
Trailor
truck
stood
at
gunpoint
and
watched
as
the
captain
of
the
Judicial
Police
let
out
a
guttural
roar
of
rage
and
heaved
a
bar
of
soap
out
into
the
turgid
waters
of
the
Seine.
Silas
gazed
upward
at
the
Saint
Sulpice
obelisk,
taking
in
the
length
of
the
massive
marble
shaft.
His
sinews
felt
taut
with
exhilaration.
He
glanced
around
the
church
one
more
time
to
make
sure
he
was
alone.
Then
he
knelt
at
the
base
of
the
structure,
not
out
of
reverence,
but
out
of
necessity.
The
keystone
is
hidden
beneath
the
Rose
Line.
At
the
base
of
the
Sulpice
obelisk.
All
the
brothers
had
concurred.
On
his
knees
now,
Silas
ran
his
hands
across
the
stone
floor.
He
saw
no
