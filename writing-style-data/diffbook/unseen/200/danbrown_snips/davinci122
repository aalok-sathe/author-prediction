the
men's
room!"
Collet
pointed
to
the
blinking
red
dot
on
his
laptop
schematic.
"He
must
have
broken
the
window
!
"
Collet
knew
Langdon
wouldn't
get
far.
Although
Paris
fire
codes
required
windows
above
fifteen
meters
in
public
buildings
be
breakable
in
case
of
fire,
exiting
a
Louvre
second
story
window
without
the
help
of
a
hook
and
ladder
would
be
suicide.
Furthermore,
there
were
no
trees
or
grass
on
the
western
end
of
the
Denon
Wing
to
cushion
a
fall.
Directly
beneath
that
rest
room
window,
the
two
lane
Place
du
Carrousel
ran
within
a
few
feet
of
the
outer
wall.
"My
God,"
Collet
exclaimed,
eyeing
the
screen.
"Langdon's
moving
to
the
window
ledge!"
But
Fache
was
already
in
motion.
Yanking
his
Manurhin
MR
93
revolver
from
his
shoulder
holster,
the
captain
dashed
out
of
the
office.
Collet
watched
the
screen
in
bewilderment
as
the
blinking
dot
arrived
at
the
window
ledge
and
then
did
something
utterly
unexpected.
The
dot
moved
outside
the
perimeter
of
the
building.
What's
going
on?
he
wondered.
Is
Langdon
out
on
a
ledge
or
"Jesuf"
Collet
jumped
to
his
feet
as
the
dot
shot
farther
outside
the
wall.
The
signal
seemed
to
shudder
