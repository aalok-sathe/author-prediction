brief
mental
vacuum.
A
moment
of
clarity
during
which
God
could
be
glimpsed.
Meditation
gurus
achieved
similar
states
of
thoughtlessness
without
sex
and
often
described
Nirvana
as
a
never
ending
spiritual
orgasm.
"Sophie,"
Langdon
said
quietly,
"it's
important
to
remember
that
the
ancients'
view
of
sex
was
entirely
opposite
from
ours
today.
Sex
begot
new
life
the
ultimate
miracle
and
miracles
could
be
performed
only
by
a
god.
The
ability
of
the
woman
to
produce
life
from
her
womb
made
her
sacred.
A
god.
Intercourse
was
the
revered
union
of
the
two
halves
of
the
human
spirit
male
and
female
through
which
the
male
could
find
spiritual
wholeness
and
communion
with
God.
What
you
saw
was
not
about
sex,
it
was
about
spirituality.
The
Hieros
Gamos
ritual
is
not
a
perversion.
It's
a
deeply
sacrosanct
ceremony."
His
words
seemed
to
strike
a
nerve.
Sophie
had
been
remarkably
poised
all
evening,
but
now,
for
the
first
time,
Langdon
saw
the
aura
of
composure
beginning
to
crack.
Tears
materialized
in
her
eyes
again,
and
she
dabbed
them
away
with
her
sleeve.
He
gave
her
a
moment.
Admittedly,
the
concept
of
sex
as
a
pathway
to
God
was
mind
boggling
at
first.
