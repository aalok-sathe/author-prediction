one
he
never
used.
Feeling
around
inside,
he
found
nothing.
What
the
devil
did
you
expect?
He
began
wondering
if
Sophie
might
just
be
insane
after
all.
Then
his
fingers
brushed
something
unexpected.
Small
and
hard.
Pinching
the
tiny
object
between
his
fingers,
Langdon
pulled
it
out
and
stared
in
astonishment.
It
was
a
metallic,
button
shaped
disk,
about
the
size
of
a
watch
battery.
He
had
never
seen
it
before.
"What
the?"
"GPS
tracking
dot,"
Sophie
said.
"Continuously
transmits
its
location
to
a
Global
Positioning
System
satellite
that
DCPJ
can
monitor.
We
use
them
to
monitor
people's
locations.
It's
accurate
within
two
feet
anywhere
on
the
globe.
They
have
you
on
an
electronic
leash.
The
agent
who
picked
you
up
at
the
hotel
slipped
it
inside
your
pocket
before
you
left
your
room."
Langdon
flashed
back
to
the
hotel
room
his
quick
shower,
getting
dressed,
the
DCPJ
agent
politely
holding
out
Langdon'
s
tweed
coat
as
they
left
the
room.
It's
cool
outside,
Mr.
Langdon,
the
agent
had
said.
Spring
in
Paris
is
not
all
your
song
boasts.
Langdon
had
thanked
him
and
donned
the
jacket.
Sophie's
olive
gaze
was
keen.
"I
didn't
tell
you
about
the
tracking
dot
