warned
of
the
dangers
of
joining.
The
media
was
now
referring
to
Opus
Dei
as
"God's
Mafia"
and
"the
Cult
of
Christ."
We
fear
what
we
do
not
understand,
Aringarosa
thought,
wondering
if
these
critics
had
any
idea
how
many
lives
Opus
Dei
had
enriched.
The
group
enjoyed
the
full
endorsement
and
blessing
of
the
Vatican.
Opus
Dei
is
a
personal
prelature
of
the

himself.
Recently,
however,
Opus

had
found
itself
threatened
by
a
force
infinitely
more
powerful
than
the

the
darkness
of
the
ocean
below.
For
an
instant,
his
eyes
refocused,
lingering
on
the
reflection
of
his
awkward
face
dark
and
oblong,
dominated
by
a
flat,
crooked
nose
that
had
been
shattered
by
a
fist
in
Spain
when
he
was
a
young
missionary.
The
physical
flaw
barely
registered
now.
Aringarosa's
was
a
world
of
the
soul,
not

the
flesh.
As

the
coast
of
Portugal,
