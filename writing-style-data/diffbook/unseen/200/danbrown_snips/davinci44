the
photograph
of
Sauniere's
body.
They
said
he
did
that
to
himself.
Langdon
looked
out
at
the
enormous
corridor
before
them.
"So
where
is
his
body?"
Fache
straightened
his
cruciform
tie
clip
and
began
to
walk.
"As
you
probably
know,
the
Grand
Gallery
is
quite
long."
The
exact
length,
if
Langdon
recalled
correctly,
was
around
fifteen
hundred
feet,
the
length
of
three
Washington
Monuments
laid
end
to
end.
Equally
breathtaking
was
the
corridor's
width,
which
easily
could
have
accommodated
a
pair
of
side
by
side
passenger
trains.
The
center
of
the
hallway
was
dotted
by
the
occasional
statue
or
colossal
porcelain
urn,
which
served
as
a
tasteful
divider
and
kept
the
flow
of
traffic
moving
down
one
wall
and
up
the
other.
Fache
was
silent
now,
striding
briskly
up
the
right
side
of
the
corridor
with
his
gaze
dead
ahead.
Langdon
felt
almost
disrespectful
to
be
racing
past
so
many
masterpieces
without
pausing
for
so
much
as
a
glance.
Not
that
I
could
see
anything
in
this
lighting,
he
thought.
The
muted
crimson
lighting
unfortunately
conjured
memories
of
Langdon'
s
last
experience
in
noninvasive
lighting
in
the
Vatican
Secret
Archives.
This
was
tonight's
second
unsettling
parallel
with
his
near
death
