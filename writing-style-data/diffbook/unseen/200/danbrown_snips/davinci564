drink
and
the
heavy
wooden
box
found
in
Teabing's
safe.
Running
his
finger
across
the
inlaid
Rose,
he
lifted
the
ornate
lid.
Inside
he
found
a
stone
cylinder
with
lettered
dials.
The
five
dials
were
arranged
to
spell
SOFIA.
Fache
stared
at
the
word
a
long
moment
and
then
lifted
the
cylinder
from
its
padded
resting
place
and
examined
every
inch.
Then,
pulling
slowly
on
the
ends,
Fache
slid
off
one
of
the
end
caps.
The
cylinder
was
empty.
Fache
set
it
back
in
the
box
and
gazed
absently
out
the
jet's
window
at
the
hangar,
pondering
his
brief
conversation
with
Sophie,
as

information
he'd
received
from
PTS
in
Chateau
Villette.
The
sound
of
his
phone
shook
him
from
his
daydream.
It
was
the
DCPJ
switchboard.
The
dispatcher
was
apologetic.
The
president
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
had
been
calling
repeatedly,
and
although
he
had
been
told
several
times
that
the
captain
was
in
London
on
business,
he
just
kept
calling.
Begrudgingly
Fache
told
the
operator
to
forward
the
call.
"Monsieur
Vernet,"
Fache
said,
before
the
man
could
even
speak,
"I
am
sorry
I
did
not
call
you
earlier.
I
have
been
busy.
As
promised,
the
