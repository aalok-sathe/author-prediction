helpful."
Vernet
broke
a
sweat.
"We
need
to
get
out
of
the
building.
I'm
afraid
the
police
will
arrive
shortly.
My
watchman
felt
obliged
to
call
Interpol."
Sophie
had
feared
as
much.
She
took
one
last
shot.
"My
grandfather
said
he
needed
to
tell
me
the
truth
about
my
family.
Does
that
mean
anything

Vernet's
cell
phone
rang,
and
he
snatched
it
off
his
belt.
"Oui?"
He
listened
a
moment,
his
expression
one
of
surprise
and
growing
concern.
"La
police?
Si
rapidement?"
He
cursed,
gave
some
quick
directions
in
French,
and
said
he
would
be
up
to
the
lobby
in
a
minute.
Hanging
up
the
phone,
he
turned
back
to
Sophie.
"The
police
have
responded
far
more
quickly
than
usual.
