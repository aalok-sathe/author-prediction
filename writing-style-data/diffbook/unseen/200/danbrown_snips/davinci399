it
is
hidden.
When
the
Church
outlawed
speaking
of
the
shunned
Mary
Magdalene,
her
story
and
importance
had
to
be
passed
on
through
more
discreet
channels
channels
that
supported
metaphor
and
symbolism."
"Of
course.
The
arts."
Langdon
motioned
to
The
Last
Supper.
"A
perfect
example.
Some
of
today's
most
enduring
art,
literature,
and
music
secretly
tell
the
history
of
Mary
Magdalene
and
Jesus."
Langdon
quickly
told
her
about
works
by
Da
Vinci,
Botticelli,
Poussin,
Bernini,
Mozart,
and
Victor
Hugo
that
all
whispered
of
the
quest
to
restore
the
banished
sacred
feminine.
Enduring
legends
like
Sir
Gawain
and
the
Green
Knight,
King
Arthur,
and
Sleeping
Beauty
were
Grail
allegories.
Victor
Hugo's
Hunchback
of
Notre
Dame
and
Mozart's
Magic
Flute
were
filled
with
Masonic
symbolism
and
Grail
secrets.
"Once
you
open
your
eyes
to
the
Holy
Grail,"
Langdon
said,
"you
see
her
everywhere.
Paintings.
Music.
Books.
Even
in
cartoons,
theme
parks,
and
popular
movies."
Langdon
held
up
his
Mickey
Mouse
watch
and
told
her
that
Walt
Disney
had
made
it
his
quiet
life's
work
to
pass
on
the
Grail
story
to
future
generations.
Throughout
his
entire
life,
Disney
had
been
hailed
as
"the
Modern
Day
Leonardo
da
Vinci."
Both
men
were
generations
