isn't
talking
yet,"
he
chimed,
"but
give
him
time."
He
bit
into
a
cracker
and
eyed
the
poem.
"So,
my
lovely,
any
headway?"
He
looked
at
Sophie.
"What
is
your
grandfather
trying
to
tell
us
here?
Where
the
devil
is
this
headstone?
This
headstone
praised
by
Templars."
Sophie
shook
her
head
and
remained
silent.
While
Teabing
again
dug
into
the
verse,
Langdon
popped
a
Coke
and
turned
to
the
window,
his
thoughts
awash
with
images

It
wouldn't
be
long
now.
Langdon
willed
the
light
of
day
to
bring
with
it
a
second
kind
of
illumination,
but
the
lighter
it
became
outside,
the
further
he
felt
from
the
truth.
He
heard
the
rhythms
of
iambic
pentameter
and
chanting,
Hieros
Gamos
and
sacred
rites,
resonating
with
the
rumble
of
the
jet.
A

praised
by
Templars.
The
plane
was
over
land
again
when
