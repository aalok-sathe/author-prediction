televangelists,
Opus
Dei's
escalating
wealth
and
power
was
a
magnet
for
suspicion.
"Many
call
Opus
Dei
a
brainwashing
cult,"
reporters
often
challenged.
"Others
call
you
an
ultraconservative
Christian
secret
society.
Which
are
you?"
"Opus
Dei
is
neither,"
the
bishop
would
patiently
reply.
"We
are
a
Catholic
Church.
We
are
a
congregation
of
Catholics
who
have
chosen
as
our
priority
to
follow
Catholic
doctrine
as
rigorously
as
we
can
in
our
own
daily
lives."
"Does
God's
Work
necessarily
include
vows
of
chastity,
tithing,
and
atonement
for
sins
through
self
flagellation
and
the
cilice?"
"You
are
describing
only
a
small
portion
of
the
Opus
Dei
population,"
Aringarosa
said.
"There
are
many
levels
of
involvement.
Thousands
of
Opus
Dei
members
are
married,
have
families,
and
do
God's
Work
in
their
own
communities.
Others
choose
lives
of
asceticism
within
our
cloistered
residence
halls.
These
choices
are
personal,
but
everyone
in
Opus
Dei
shares
the
goal
of
bettering
the
world
by
doing
the
Work
of
God.
Surely
this
is
an
admirable
quest."
Reason
seldom
worked,
though.
The
media
always
gravitated
toward
scandal,
and
Opus
Dei,
like
most
large
organizations,
had
within
its
membership
a
few
misguided
souls
who
cast
a
shadow
over
the
entire
group.
