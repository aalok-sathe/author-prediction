a
vacation,
Robert.
The
past
year
had
taken
a
heavy
toll
on
him,
but
he
didn't
appreciate
seeing
proof
in
the
mirror.
His
usually
sharp
blue
eyes
looked
hazy
and
drawn
tonight.
A
dark
stubble
was
shrouding
his
strong
jaw
and
dimpled
chin.
Around
his
temples,
the
gray
highlights
were

had
given.
"Ladies

the
hostess
had
announced
to
a

house
at
the

of
Paris's
Pavilion
Dauphine,
