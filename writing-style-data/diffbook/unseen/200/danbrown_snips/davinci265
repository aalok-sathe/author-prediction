The
secretariat
nodded.
"Large
denomination
bearer
bonds
drawn
on
the
Vatican
Bank.
Negotiable
as
cash
anywhere
in
the
world."
Aringarosa
walked
to
the
end
of
the
table
and
opened
the
briefcase.
Inside
were
two
thick
stacks
of
bonds,
each
embossed
with
the
Vatican
seal
and
the
title
PORTATORE,
making
the
bonds
redeemable
to
whoever
was
holding
them.
The
secretariat
looked
tense.
"I
must
say,
Bishop,
all
of
us
would
feel
less
apprehensive
if
these
funds
were
in
cash.
I
could
not
lift
that
much
cash,
Aringarosa
thought,
closing
the
case.
"Bonds
are
negotiable
as
cash.
You
said
so
yourself.
The
cardinals
exchanged
uneasy
looks,
and
finally
one
said,
"Yes,
but
these
bonds
are
traceable
directly
to
the
Vatican
Bank."
Aringarosa
smiled
inwardly.
That
was
precisely
the
reason
the
Teacher
suggested
Aringarosa
get
the
money
in
Vatican
Bank
bonds.
It
served
as
insurance.
We
are
all
in
this
together
now.
"This
is
a
perfectly
legal
transaction,"
Aringarosa
defended.
"Opus
Dei
is
a
personal
prelature
of
Vatican
City,
and
His
Holiness
can
disperse
monies
however
he
sees
fit.
No
law
has
been
broken
here."
"True,
and
yet"
The
secretariat
leaned
forward
and
his
chair
creaked
under
the
burden.
"We
have
no
knowledge
