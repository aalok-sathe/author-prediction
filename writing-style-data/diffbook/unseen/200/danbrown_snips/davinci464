thousand
feet
in

Robert
Langdon
felt
the
physical
world
fade
away
as
all
of
his
thoughts
converged
on
Sauniere's
mirror
image
poem,
which
was
illuminated
through
the
lid
of
the
box.

Sophie
quickly
found
some
paper
and
copied
it
down
longhand.
When
she
was
done,
the
three
of
them
took
turns
reading
the
text.
It
was
like
some
kind
of
archaeological
crossword
a
riddle
that
promised
to
reveal
how
to
open
the
cryptex.
Langdon
read
the
verse
slowly.

Before
Langdon
could
even
ponder
what
ancient
password
the
verse
was
trying
to
reveal,
he
felt
something
far
more
fundamental
resonate
within
him
the
meter
of
the
poem.
Iambic
pentameter.
Langdon
had
come
across
this
meter
often
over
the
years
while
researching
secret
societies
across
Europe,
including
just
last
year
in
the
Vatican
Secret
Archives.
For
centuries,
iambic
pentameter
had
been
a
preferred
poetic
meter
of
outspoken
literati
across
the
globe,
from
the
ancient
Greek
writer
Archilochus
to
Shakespeare,
Milton,
Chaucer,
and
Voltaire
