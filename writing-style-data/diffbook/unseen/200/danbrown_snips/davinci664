to
nature
and
the
goddess.
The
sanctuary
was
empty
except
for
a
handful
of
visitors
listening
to
a
young
man
giving
the
day's
last
tour.
He
was
leading
them
in
a
single
file
line
along
a
well
known
route
on
the
floor
an
invisible
pathway
linking
six
key
architectural
points
within
the
sanctuary.
Generations
of
visitors
had
walked
these
straight
lines,
connecting
the
points,
and
their
countless
footsteps
had
engraved
an
enormous
symbol
on
the
floor.
The
Star
of
David,
Langdon
thought.
No
coincidence
there.
Also
known
as
Solomon's
Seal,
this
hexagram
had
once
been
the
secret
symbol
of
the
stargazing
priests
and
was
later
adopted
by
the
Israelite
kings
David
and
Solomon.
The
docent
had
seen
Langdon
and
Sophie
enter,
and
although
it
was
closing
time,
offered
a
pleasant
smile
and
motioned
for
them
to
feel
free
to
look
around.
Langdon
nodded
his
thanks
and
began
to
move
deeper
into
the
sanctuary.
Sophie,
however,
stood
riveted
in
the
entryway,
a
puzzled
look
on
her
face.
"What
is
it?"
Langdon
asked.
Sophie
stared
out
at
the
chapel.
"I
think
I've
been
here."
Langdon
was
surprised.
"But
you
said
you
hadn't
even
heard
of
Rosslyn."
"I
hadn't"
She
scanned
the
sanctuary,
