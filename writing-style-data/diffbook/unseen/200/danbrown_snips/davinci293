Langdon
shed
his
jacket,
Vernet
hurried
over
to
the
conveyor
belt,
closed
the
now
empty
crate,
and
typed
a
series
of
simple
commands.
The
conveyor
belt
began
moving
again,
carrying
the
plastic
container
back
down
to
the
vault.
Pulling
the
gold
key
from
the
podium,
he
handed
it
to
Sophie.
"This
way
please.
Hurry."
When
they
reached
the
rear
loading
dock,
Vernet
could
see
the
flash
of
police
lights
filtering
through
the
underground
garage.
He
frowned.
They
were
probably
blocking
the
ramp.
Am
I
really
going
to
try
to
pull
this
off?
He
was
sweating
now.
Vernet
motioned
to
one
of
the
bank's
small
armored
trucks.
Transport
siir
was
another
service
offered
by
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich.
"Get
in
the
cargo
hold,"
he
said,
heaving
open
the
massive
rear
door
and
motioning
to
the
glistening
steel
compartment.
"I'll
be
right
back."
As
Sophie
and
Langdon
climbed
in,
Vernet
hurried
across
the
loading
dock
to
the
dock
overseer's
office,
let
himself
in,
collected
the
keys
for
the
truck,
and
found
a
driver's
uniform
jacket
and
cap.
Shedding
his
own
suit
coat
and
tie,
he
began
to
put
on
the
driver's
jacket.
Reconsidering,
he
donned
a
shoulder
holster
beneath
the
uniform.
