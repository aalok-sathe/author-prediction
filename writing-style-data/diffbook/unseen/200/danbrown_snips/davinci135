himself
like
my
favorite
piece
of
art,
or
drawing
a
pentacle
on
himself.
All
of
it
was
to
catch
my
attention."
"The
pentacle
has
meaning
to
you?"
"Yes.
I
didn't
get
a
chance
to
tell
you,
but
the
pentacle
was
a
special
symbol
between
my
grandfather
and
me
when
I
was
growing
up.
We
used
to
play
Tarot
cards
for
fun,
and
my
indicator
card
always
turned
out
to
be
from
the
suit
of
pentacles.
I'm
sure
he
stacked
the
deck,
but
pentacles
got
to
be
our
little
joke."
Langdon
felt
a
chill.
They
played
Tarot?
The
medieval
Italian
card
game
was
so
replete
with
hidden
heretical
symbolism
that
Langdon
had
dedicated
an
entire
chapter
in
his
new
manuscript
to
the
Tarot.
The
game's
twenty
two
cards
bore
names
like
The
Female
Pope,
The
Empress,
and
The
Star.
Originally,
Tarot
had
been
devised
as
a
secret
means
to
pass
along
ideologies
banned
by
the
Church.
Now,
Tarot's
mystical
qualities
were
passed
on
by
modern
fortune
tellers.
The
Tarot
indicator
suit
for
feminine
divinity
is
pentacles,
Langdon
thought,
realizing
that
if
Sauniere
had
been
stacking
his
granddaughter's
deck
for
fun,
pentacles
was
an
apropos
inside
joke.
They
arrived
at
the
emergency
