rites
to
celebrate
fertility
and
the
Goddess.
Langdon
felt
as
if
he
were
crossing
into
another
world
as
he
stepped
over
the
bushes
to
the
grassy
area
within.
This
hallowed
ground
was
now
marked
by
one
of
the
city's
most
unusual
monuments.
There
in
the
center,
plunging
into
the
earth
like
a
crystal
chasm,
gaped
the
giant
inverted
pyramid
of
glass
that
he
had
seen
a
few
nights
ago
when
he
entered
the
Louvre's
subterranean
entresol.
La
Pyramide
Inversee.
Tremulous,
Langdon
walked
to
the
edge
and
peered
down
into
the
Louvre's
sprawling
underground
complex,
aglow
with
amber
light.
His
eye
was
trained
not
just
on
the
massive
inverted
pyramid,
but
on
what
lay
directly
beneath
it.
There,
on
the
floor
of
the
chamber
below,
stood
the
tiniest
of
structures
a
structure
Langdon
had
mentioned
in
his
manuscript.
Langdon
felt
himself
awaken
fully
now
to
the
thrill
of
unthinkable
possibility.
Raising
his
eyes
again
to
the
Louvre,
he
sensed
the
huge
wings
of
the
museum
enveloping
him
hallways
that
burgeoned
with
the
world's
finest
art.
Da
Vinci
Botticelli
Adorned
in
masters'
loving
art,
She
lies.
Alive
with
wonder,
he
stared
once
again
downward
through
the
glass
at
the
tiny
structure
below.
