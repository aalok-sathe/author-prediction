one
of
the
airfield's
most
respected
customers.
It
failed
miserably.
"Okay,"
Fache
said,
"I
am
placing
you
under
arrest
for
permitting
a
private
plane
to
take
off
without
registering
a
flight
plan.
"
Fache
motioned
to
another
officer,
who
approached
with
handcuffs,
and
the
traffic
controller
felt
a
surge
of
terror.
He
thought
of
the
newspaper
articles
debating
whether
the
nation's
police
captain
was
a
hero
or
a
menace.
That
question
had
just
been
answered.
"Wait!"
the
controller
heard
himself
whimper
at
the
sight
of
the
handcuffs.
"I
can
tell
you
this
much.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
makes
frequent
trips
to
London
for
medical
treatments.
He
has
a
hangar
at
Biggin
Hill
Executive
Airport
in
Kent.
On
the
outskirts
of
London."
Fache
waved
off
the
man
with
the
cuffs.
"Is
Biggin
Hill
his
destination
tonight?"
"I
don't
know,"
the
controller
said
honestly.
"The
plane
left
on
its
usual
tack,
and
his
last
radar
contact
suggested
the
United
Kingdom.
Biggin
Hill
is
an
extremely
likely
guess."
"Did
he
have
others
onboard?"
"I
swear,
sir,
there
is
no
way
for
me
to
know
that.
Our
clients
can
drive
directly
to
their
hangars,
and
load
as
they
please.
Who
is
onboard
is
the
responsibility
