out
south
exit,
to
public
garden.
"We
just
left
the
east
cloister,"
Langdon
said,
"so
the
south
exit
to
the
garden
must
be
through
there
and
to
the
right."
Sophie
was
already
stepping
over
the
swag
and
moving
forward.
As
they
hurried
down
the
dark
corridor,
the
sounds
of
the
wind
and
rain
from
the
open
cloister
faded
behind
them.
The
Chapter
House
was
a
kind
of
satellite
structure
a
freestanding
annex
at
the
end
of
the
long
hallway
to
ensure
the
privacy
of
the
Parliament
proceedings
housed
there.
"It
looks
huge,"
Sophie
whispered
as
they
approached.
Langdon
had
forgotten
just
how
large
this
room
was.
Even
from
outside
the
entrance,
he
could
gaze
across
the
vast
expanse
of
floor
to
the
breathtaking
windows
on
the
far
side
of
the
octagon,
which
rose
five
stories
to
a
vaulted
ceiling.
They
would
certainly
have
a
clear
view
of
the
garden
from
in
here.
Crossing
the
threshold,
both
Langdon
and
Sophie
found
themselves
having
to
squint.
After
the
gloomy
cloisters,
the
Chapter
House
felt
like
a
solarium.
They
were
a
good
ten
feet
into
the
room,
searching
the
south
wall,
when
they
realized
the
door
they
had
been
promised
was
not
there.
