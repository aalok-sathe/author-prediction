you
have
any
idea
what
my
grandfather
is
storing
in
your
bank?"
"None
whatsoever.
That
is
the
definition
of
a
Geldschrank
bank."
"Monsieur
Vernet,"
she
pressed,
"our
time
tonight
is
short.
I
am
going
to
be
very
direct

business."
The
man
adjusted
his
tie,
looking
nervous
now.
"Monsieur
Vernet,"
Sophie
pressed,
her
tone
firm.
"My
grandfather
called
me
tonight
and
told
me
he
and
I
were
in
grave
danger.
He
said
he
had
to
give
me
something.
He
gave
me
a
key
to
your
bank.
Now
he
