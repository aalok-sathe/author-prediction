of
Sion,"
he
began,
"was
founded
in
Jerusalem
in
1099
by
a
French
king
named
Godefroi
de
Bouillon,
immediately
after
he
had
conquered
the
city."
Sophie
nodded,
her
eyes
riveted
on
him.
"King
Godefroi
was
allegedly
the
possessor
of
a
powerful
secret
a
secret
that
had
been
in
his
family
since
the
time
of
Christ.
Fearing
his
secret
might
be
lost
when
he
died,
he
founded
a
secret
brotherhood
the
Priory
of
Sion
and
charged
them
with
protecting
his
secret
by
quietly
passing
it
on
from
generation
to
generation.
During
their
years
in
Jerusalem,
the
Priory
learned
of
a
stash
of
hidden
documents
buried
beneath
the
ruins
of
Herod's
temple,
which
had
been
built
atop
the
earlier
ruins
of
Solomon's
Temple.
These
documents,
they
believed,
corroborated
Godefroi's
powerful
secret
and
were
so
explosive
in
nature
that
the
Church
would
stop
at
nothing
to
get
them."
Sophie
looked
uncertain.
"The
Priory
vowed
that
no
matter
how
long
it
took,
these
documents
must
be
recovered
from
the
rubble
beneath
the
temple
and
protected
forever,
so
the
truth
would
never
die.
In
order
to
retrieve
the
documents
from
within
the
ruins,
the
Priory
created
a
military
arm
a
group
of
nine
knights
