you
remember
earlier
that
I
mentioned
Rosslyn
itself
is
a
copy
of
Solomon's
Temple?
Those
two
pillars
are
exact
replicas
of
the
two
pillars
that
stood
at
the
head
of
Solomon's
Temple."
Langdon
pointed
to
the
pillar
on
the
left.
"That's
called
Boaz
or
the
Mason's
Pillar.
The

Templar
days.

central
ceiling,
which
was
covered
with
carvings
of
stars
and
planets.
"I've
never
been
in
a
Masonic
temple,"
Sophie
said,
still
eyeing
the
pillars.
"I
am
almost
positive
I
saw
these
here.

She
turned
back
into
the
chapel,
as
if
looking
for
something
else
to
jog
her
memory.
The
rest
of
the
visitors
were
now
leaving,
and
the
young
docent
made
his

the
chapel
to
