voices
clearer.
She
heard
men
and
women
now.
Her
line
of
sight
was
limited
by
the
spiral
of
the
staircase,
but
the
last
step
was
now
rounding
into
view.
Beyond
it,
she
could
see
a
small
patch
of
the
basement
floor
stone,
illuminated
by
the
flickering
orange
blaze
of
firelight.
Holding
her
breath,
Sophie
inched
down
another
few
steps
and
crouched
down
to
look.
It
took
her
several
seconds
to
process
what
she
was
seeing.
The
room
was
a
grotto
a
coarse
chamber
that
appeared
to
have

A

What
else
could
this
be?
Everyone
in
the
room
was
wearing
a
mask.
The
women
were
dressed
in
white
gossamer
gowns
and
golden
shoes.
Their
masks
were
white,
and
in
their
hands
they
carried
golden
orbs.
The
men
wore
long
black
tunics,
and
their
masks
were
black.
They
looked
like
pieces
in
a
giant
chess
set.
Everyone
in
the
circle
rocked
back
and

and
chanted
in
reverence
