line
is
secure,
Mr.
Langdon.
You
may
use
it."
Langdon
felt
mystified
by
Fache's
anger
with
the
young
woman.
Feeling
uneasy,
he
accepted
the
captain's
phone.
Fache
immediately
marched
Sophie
several
steps
away
and
began
chastising
her
in
hushed
tones.
Disliking
the
captain
more
and
more,
Langdon
turned
away
from
the
odd
confrontation
and
switched
on
the
cell
phone.
Checking
the
slip
of
paper
Sophie
had
given
him,
Langdon
dialed
the
number.
The
line
began
to
ring.
One
ring
two
rings
three
rings
Finally
the
call
connected.
Langdon
expected
to
hear
an
embassy
operator,
but
he
found
himself
instead
listening
to
an
answering
machine.
Oddly,
the
voice
on
the
tape
was
familiar.
It
was
that
of
Sophie
Neveu.
"Bonjour,
vous
etes
bien
chez
Sophie
Neveu,
"
the
woman's
voice
said.
"Je
suis
absenle
pour
le
moment,
mais"
Confused,
Langdon
turned
back
toward
Sophie.
"I'm
sorry,
Ms.
Neveu?
I
think
you
may
have
given
me
"No,
that's
the
right
number,"
Sophie
interjected
quickly,
as
if
anticipating
Langdon's
confusion.
"The
embassy
has
an
automated
message
system.
You
have
to
dial
an
access
code
to
pick
up
your
messages.
Langdon
stared.
"But
"It's
the
three
digit
code
on
the
paper
I
gave
you."
