Collet
and
his
men
moved
room
by
room
through
the
huge
home,
securing
darkened
bedrooms
and
hallways
as
they
closed
in
on
the
sounds
of
voices.
The
sound
seemed
to
be
coming
from
the
last
bedroom
on
an
exceptionally
long
hallway.
The
agents
inched
down
the
corridor,
sealing
off
alternate
exits.

they
neared
the
final
bedroom,
Collet
could

electronic
panel
on
the
wall
beside
the
bed.
Collet
had
seen
these
elsewhere
in
the
house.
Some
kind
of
intercom
system.
He
raced
over.
The
panel
had
about
a
dozen
labeled
buttons:
STUDY
KITCHEN
LAUNDRY
CELLAR
So
where

hell
do
I
hear
a
car?
MASTER
BEDROOM
SUN
ROOM
BARN
LIBRARY.
Barn!
Collet
was
downstairs
in

running
toward
the
back
door,
