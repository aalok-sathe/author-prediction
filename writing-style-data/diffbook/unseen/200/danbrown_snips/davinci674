herself
drawn
closer,
Sophie
stepped
onto
the
porch
stairs.
The
woman
was
clutching
a
framed
photograph
of
a
man
and
touching
her
fingertips
to
his
face
with
loving
sadness.
It
was
a
face
Sophie
knew
well.
Grand
pere.
The
woman
had
obviously
heard
the
sad
news
of
his
death
last
night.
A
board

thunderstruck
face.
"Oh,

Although
Sophie
did
not
recognize
her,

woman
sobbed,
kissing
her
forehead.
