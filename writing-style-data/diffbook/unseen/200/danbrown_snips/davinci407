Then,
as
if
too
tired
to
stand
another
moment,
he
flopped
in
a
chair
and
stared
out
the
window.
Sophie
walked
over,
her
voice
soft.
"Considering
my
grandfather's
predicament,
it
seems
possible
that
in
total
desperation
he
tried
to
pass
the
secret
on
to
someone
outside
the
brotherhood.
Someone
he

Teabing
was

"But
someone
capable

such
an
attack

discovering
so
much
about
the

itself.
The
documents
that
accompany
the
Holy
Grail
are
explosive,
and
the
Church
has
wanted
to
destroy
them
for
years."
Langdon
was
having
trouble
buying
Teabing's
premise
that
the
Church
would
blatantly
murder
people
to
obtain
these
documents.
Having
met
the
new
Pope
and
many
of
the
cardinals,
Langdon
knew
they
were
deeply
spiritual
men
who
