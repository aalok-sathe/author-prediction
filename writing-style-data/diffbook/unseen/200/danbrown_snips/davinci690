considered
before.
Could
it
be?
He
remained
motionless
a
long
moment.
Getting
out
of
bed,
he
walked
to
the
marble
shower.
Stepping
inside,
he
let
the
powerful
jets
message
his
shoulders.
Still,
the
thought
enthralled
him.
Impossible.
Twenty
minutes
later,
Langdon
stepped
out
of
the
Hotel
Ritz
into
Place
Vendome.
Night
was
falling.
The
days
of
sleep
had
left
him
disoriented
and
yet
his
mind
felt
oddly
lucid.
He
had
promised
himself
he
would
stop
in
the
hotel
lobby
for
a
cafe
au

to
clear
his
thoughts,
but
instead
his
legs
carried
him
directly
out
the
front
door
into
the
gathering
Paris
night.
Walking
east
on
Rue
des
Petits
Champs,
Langdon
felt
a
growing
excitement.
He
turned
south
onto
Rue
Richelieu,
where
the
air
grew
sweet
with
the
scent
of
blossoming
jasmine
from
the
stately
gardens
of
the
Palais
Royal.
He
continued
south
until
he
saw
what
he
was
looking
for
the
famous
royal
arcade
a
glistening
expanse
of
polished
black
marble.
Moving
onto
it,
Langdon
scanned
the
surface
beneath
his
feet.
Within
seconds,
he
found
what
he
knew
was
there
several
bronze
medallions
embedded
in
the
ground
in
a
perfectly
straight
line.
Each
disk
was
five
inches
in
