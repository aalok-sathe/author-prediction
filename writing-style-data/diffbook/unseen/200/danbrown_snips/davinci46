found
the
Grand
Gallery
sealed.
Through
the
gate,
they
could
hear
someone
moving
around
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor,
but
they
could
not
see
who
it
was.
They
shouted,
but
they
got
no
answer.
Assuming
it
could
only
be
a
criminal,
they
followed
protocol
and
called
in
the
Judicial
Police.
We
took
up
positions
within
fifteen
minutes.
When
we
arrived,
we

hallway.

Langdon
began
to
see
past
the
statue.
Thirty
yards
down
the
hall,
a
single
spotlight
on
a
portable
pole
stand
shone
down
on
the
floor,
creating
a
stark
island
of
white
light
in
the
dark
crimson
gallery.
In
the
center
of
the
light,
like
an
insect
under
a
microscope,
the
corpse
of
the
curator
lay
naked
on
the
parquet
floor.
"You
saw
the
photograph,"
Fache
said,
