to
his
knees.
As
he
fell,
he
thought
for
a
moment
he
saw
a
pale
ghost
hovering
over
him,
clutching
a
gun.
Then
everything
went
black.
Sophie
Neveu,
despite
working
in
law
enforcement,
had
never
found
herself
at
gunpoint
until
tonight.
Almost
inconceivably,
the
gun
into
which
she
was
now
staring
was
clutched
in
the
pale
hand
of
an
enormous
albino
with
long
white
hair.
He
looked
at
her
with
red
eyes
that
radiated
a
frightening,
disembodied
quality.
Dressed
in
a
wool
robe
with
a
rope
tie,
he
resembled
a
medieval
cleric.
Sophie
could
not
imagine
who
he
was,
and
yet
she
was
feeling
a
sudden
newfound
respect
for
Teabing's
suspicions
that
the
Church
was
behind
this.
"You
know
what
I
have
come
for,"
the
monk
said,
his
voice
hollow.
Sophie
and
Teabing
were
seated
on
the
divan,
arms
raised
as
their
attacker
had
commanded.
Langdon
lay
groaning
on
the
floor.
The
monk's
eyes
fell
immediately
to
the
keystone
on
Teabing's
lap.
Teabing's
tone
was
defiant.
"You
will
not
be
able
to
open
it."
"My
Teacher
is
very
wise,"
the
monk
replied,
inching
closer,
the
gun
shifting
between
Teabing
and
Sophie.
Sophie
wondered
where
Teabing's
manservant
was.
Didn't
he
hear
