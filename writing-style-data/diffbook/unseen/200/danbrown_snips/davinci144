unexpectedly
deciphered
Sauniere's
code.
"O,
Draconian
devil!"
he
said.
"Oh,
lame
saint!
It's
the
simplest
kind
of
code!"
Sophie
was
stopped
on
the
stairs
below
him,
staring
up
in
confusion.
A
code?
She
had
been
pondering
the
words
all
night
and
had
not
seen
a
code.
Especially
a
simple
one.
"You
said
it
yourself."
Langdon's
voice
reverberated
with
excitement.
"Fibonacci
numbers
only
have
meaning
in
their
proper
order.
Otherwise
they're
mathematical
gibberish.
Sophie
had
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about.
The
Fibonacci
numbers?
She
was
certain
they
had
been
intended
as
nothing
more
than
a
means
to
get
the
Cryptography
Department
involved
tonight.
They
have
another
purpose?
She
plunged
her
hand
into
her
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
printout,
studying
her
grandfather's
message
again.

O,

Oh,

What
about
the
numbers
?
"The
scrambled
Fibonacci
sequence
is
a
clue,"
Langdon
said,
taking
the
printout.
"The
numbers
are
a
hint
as
to
how
to
decipher
the
rest
of
the
message.
He
wrote
the
sequence
out
of
order
to
tell
us
to
apply
the
same
concept
to
the
text.
O,
Draconian
devil?
Oh,
lame
saint?
Those
lines
mean
nothing.
