his
feet
and
then
up
at
the
massive
iron
grate.
He's
kidding,
right?
The
barricade
looked
like
a
guillotine
waiting
to
crush
intruders.
Fache
grumbled
something
in
French
and
checked
his
watch.
Then
he
dropped
to
his
knees
and
slithered
his
bulky
frame
underneath
the
grate.
On
the
other
side,
he
stood
up
and
looked
back
through
the
bars
at
Langdon.
Langdon
sighed.
Placing
his
palms
flat
on
the
polished
parquet,
he
lay
on
his
stomach
and
pulled
himself
forward.
As
he
slid
underneath,
the
nape
of
his
Harris
tweed
snagged
on
the
bottom
of
the
grate,
and
he
cracked
the
back
of
his
head
on
the
iron.
Very
suave,
Robert,
he
thought,
fumbling
and
then
finally
pulling
himself
through.
As
he
stood
up,
Langdon
was
beginning
to
suspect
it
was
going
to
be
a
very
long
night.
