at
your
service.
What
is
it
I
can
tell
you?"
Langdon
sighed.
"I
was
hoping
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
explain
to
Ms.
Neveu
the
true
nature
of
the
Holy
Grail."
Teabing
looked
stunned.
"She
doesn't
know?"
Langdon
shook
his
head.
The
smile
that
grew
on
Teabing's
face
was
almost
obscene.
"Robert,
you've
brought
me
a
virgin?"
Langdon
winced,
glancing
at
Sophie.
"Virgin
is
the
term
Grail
enthusiasts
use
to
describe
anyone
who
has
never
heard
the
true
Grail
story."
Teabing
turned
eagerly
to
Sophie.
"How
much
do
you
know,
my
dear?"
Sophie
quickly
outlined
what
Langdon
had
explained
earlier
the
Priory
of
Sion,
the
Knights
Templar,
the
Sangreal
documents,
and
the
Holy
Grail,
which
many
claimed
was
not
a
cup
but
rather
something
far
more
powerful.
"That's
all?"
Teabing
fired
Langdon
a
scandalous
look.
"Robert,
I
thought
you
were
a
gentleman.
You've
robbed
her
of
the
climax!"
"I
know,
I
thought
perhaps
you
and
I
could"
Langdon
apparently
decided
the
unseemly
metaphor
had
gone
far
enough.
Teabing
already
had
Sophie
locked
in
his
twinkling
gaze.
"You
are
a
Grail
virgin,
my
dear.
And
trust
me,
you
will
never
forget
your
first
time."
Seated
on
the
divan
beside
Langdon,
