our
safety.
Finally,
overcoming
enormous
trepidation,
Silas
crawled
to
his
feet
and
found
his
robe,
which
lay
on
the
floor.
He
dug
his
cell
phone
from
the
pocket.
Hanging
his
head
in
shame,
he
dialed.
"Teacher,"
he
whispered,
"all
is
lost."
Silas
truthfully
told
the
man
how
he
had
been
tricked.
"You
lose
your
faith
too
quickly,"
the
Teacher
replied.
"I
have
just
received
news.
Most
unexpected
and
welcome.
The
secret
lives.
Jacques
Sauniere
transferred
information
before
he
died.
I
will
call
you
soon.
Our
work
tonight
is
not
yet
done."
Riding
inside

cargo
hold
of
the
armored
truck

being

him
in
confined
spaces.
Vernet
said
he
would
take
us
a
safe
distance
out
of
the
city.
Where?
How
far?
Langdon's
legs
had
gotten
stiff
from
sitting
cross
legged
on
the
metal
floor,
and
he
shifted
his
position,
wincing
to
feel
the
blood
pouring
back
into
his
lower
body.
In
his
arms,
he
still
clutched
the
bizarre
treasure
they
had
extricated
from
the
bank.
"I
think
we're
on
the
highway
now,"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
sensed
the
same
thing.
The
