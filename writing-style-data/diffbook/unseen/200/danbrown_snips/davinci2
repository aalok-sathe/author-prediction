some
religious
scholar
had
trailed
him
home
to
pick
a
fight.
"I'm
sorry,"
Langdon
said,
"but
I'm
very
tired
and
"Mais,
monsieur,
"
the
concierge
pressed,
lowering
his
voice
to
an
urgent
whisper.
"Your
guest
is
an
important
man."
Langdon
had
little
doubt.
His
books
on
religious
paintings
and
cult
symbology
had
made
him
a
reluctant
celebrity
in
the
art
world,
and
last
year
Langdon's
visibility
had
increased
a
hundredfold
after
his
involvement
in
a
widely
publicized
incident
at
the
Vatican.
Since
then,
the
stream
of
self
important
historians
and
art
buffs
arriving
at
his
door
had
seemed
never
ending.
"If
you
would
be
so
kind,"
Langdon
said,
doing
his
best
to
remain
polite,
"could
you
take
the
man's
name
and
number,
and
tell
him
I'll
try
to
call
him
before
I
leave
Paris
on
Tuesday?
Thank
you."
He
hung
up
before
the
concierge
could
protest.
Sitting
up
now,
Langdon
frowned
at
his
bedside
Guest
Relations
Handbook,
whose
cover
boasted:
SLEEP
LIKE
A
BABY
IN
THE
CITY
OF
LIGHTS.
SLUMBER
AT
THE
PARIS
RITZ.
He
turned
and
gazed
tiredly
into
the
full
length
mirror
across
the
room.
The
man
staring
back
at
him
was
a
stranger
tousled
and
weary.
