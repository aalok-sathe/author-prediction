his
pocket.
"No!"
Teabing
cried
out,
trying
in
vain
to
stand.
When
the
doors
burst
open,
Bezu
Fache
entered
like
a
bull
into
a
ring,
his
feral
eyes
scanning,
finding
his
target
Leigh
Teabing
helpless
on
the
floor.
Exhaling
in
relief,
Fache
holstered
his
Manurhin
sidearm
and
turned
to
Sophie.
"Agent
Neveu,
I
am
relieved
you
and
Mr.
Langdon
are
safe.
You
should
have
come
in
when
I
asked."
The
British
police
entered
on
Fache's
heels,
seizing
the
anguished
prisoner
and
placing
him
in
handcuffs.
Sophie
seemed
stunned
to
see
Fache.
"How
did
you
find
us?"
Fache
pointed
to
Teabing.
"He
made
the
mistake
of
showing
his
ID
when
he
entered
the
abbey.
The
guards
heard
a
police
broadcast
about
our
search
for
him."
"It's
in
Langdon's
pocket!"
Teabing
was
screaming
like
a
madman.
"The
map
to
the
Holy
Grail!"
As
they
hoisted
Teabing
and
carried
him
out,
he
threw
back
his
head
and
howled.
"Robert!
Tell
me
where
it's
hidden!"
As
Teabing
passed,
Langdon
looked
him
in
the
eye.
"Only
the
worthy
find
the
Grail,
Leigh.
You
taught
me
that.
The
mist
had
settled
low
on
Kensington
Gardens
as
Silas
limped
into
a
quiet
hollow
out
of
sight.
Kneeling
