A
weapon
of
death
has
no
place
in
a
house
of
God.
The
plaza
before
the
great
church
was
deserted
at
this
hour,
the
only
visible
souls
on
the
far
side
of
Place
Saint
Sulpice
a
couple
of
teenage
hookers
showing
their
wares
to
the
late
night
tourist
traffic.
Their
nubile
bodies
sent
a
familiar
longing
to
Silas's
loins.
His
thigh
flexed
instinctively,
causing
the
barbed
cilice
belt
to
cut
painfully
into
his
flesh.
The
lust
evaporated
instantly.
For
ten
years
now,
Silas
had
faithfully
denied
himself
all
sexual
indulgence,
even
self
administered.
It
was
The
Way.
He
knew
he
had
sacrificed
much
to
follow
Opus
Dei,
but
he
had
received
much
more
in
return.
A
vow
of
celibacy
and
the
relinquishment
of
all
personal
assets
hardly
seemed
a
sacrifice.
Considering
the
poverty
from
which
he
had
come
and
the
sexual
horrors
he
had
endured
in
prison,
celibacy
was
a
welcome
change.
Now,
having
returned
to
France
for
the
first
time
since
being
arrested
and
shipped
to
prison
in
Andorra,
Silas
could
feel
his
homeland
testing
him,
dragging
violent
memories
from
his
redeemed
soul.
You
have
been
reborn,
