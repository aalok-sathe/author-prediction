in
Medieval
Literature:
A
Treatise
on
Sir
Gawain
and
the
Green
Knight.
"Allegory
of
the
Green
Knight,"
he
called
back.
"No
good,"
Gettum
said.
"Not
many
mythological
green
giants
buried
in
London."
Langdon
and
Sophie
sat
patiently
in
front
of
the
screen
and
waited
through
two
more
dubious
returns.
When
the
computer
pinged
again,
though,
the
offering
was
unexpected.
DIE
OPERN
VON
RICHARD
WAGNER
"The
operas
of
Wagner?"
Sophie
asked.
Gettum
peeked
back
in
the
doorway,
holding
a
packet
of
instant
coffee.
"That
seems
like
a
strange
match.
Was
Wagner
a
knight?"
"No,"
Langdon
said,
feeling
a
sudden
intrigue.
"But
he
was
a
well
known
Freemason."
Along
with
Mozart,
Beethoven,
Shakespeare,
Gershwin,
Houdini,
and
Disney.
Volumes
had
been
written
about
the
ties
between
the
Masons
and
the
Knights
Templar,
the
Priory
of
Sion,
and
the
Holy
Grail.
"I
want
to
look
at
this
one.
How
do
I
see
the
full
text?"
"You
don't
want
the
full
text,"
Gettum
called.
"Click
on
the
hypertext
title.
The
computer
will
display
your
keyword
hits
along
with
mono
prelogs
and
triple
postlogs
for
context."
Langdon
had
no
idea
what
she
had
just
said,
but
he
clicked
anyway.
A
new
window
popped
up.
