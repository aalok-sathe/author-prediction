over
the
Vatican.
In
a
military
maneuver
worthy
of
the
CIA,
Pope
Clement
issued
secret
sealed
orders
to
be
opened
simultaneously
by
his
soldiers
all
across
Europe
on
Friday,
October
13
of
1307.
At
dawn
on
the
thirteenth,
the
documents
were
unsealed
and
their
appalling
contents
revealed.
Clement's
letter
claimed
that
God
had
visited
him
in
a
vision
and
warned
him
that
the
Knights
Templar
were
heretics
guilty
of
devil
worship,
homosexuality,
defiling
the
cross,
sodomy,
and
other
blasphemous
behavior.
Pope
Clement
had
been
asked
by
God
to
cleanse
the
earth
by
rounding
up
all
the
Knights
and
torturing
them
until
they
confessed
their
crimes
against
God.
Clement's
Machiavellian
operation
came
off
with
clockwork
precision.
On
that
day,
countless
Knights
were
captured,
tortured
mercilessly,
and
finally
burned
at
the
stake
as
heretics.
Echoes
of
the
tragedy
still
resonated
in
modern
culture;
to
this
day,
Friday
the
thirteenth
was
considered
unlucky.
Sophie
looked
confused.
"The
Knights
Templar
were
obliterated?
I
thought
fraternities
of
Templars
still
exist
today?"
"They
do,
under
a
variety
of
names.
Despite
Clement's
false
charges
and
best
efforts
to
eradicate
them,
the
Knights
had
powerful
allies,
and
some
managed
to
escape
the
Vatican
purges.
