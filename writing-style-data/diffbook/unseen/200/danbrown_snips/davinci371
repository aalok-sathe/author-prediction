is!"
Sophie
was
certain
she
had
missed
something.
"That's
the
same
painting
you
just
showed
me."
He
winked.
"I
know,
but
the
enlargement
is
so
much
more
exciting.
Don't
you
think?"
Sophie
turned
to
Langdon
for
help.
"I'm
lost."
Langdon
smiled.
"As
it
turns
out,
the
Holy
Grail
does
indeed
make
an
appearance
in
The
Last
Supper.
Leonardo
included
her
prominently."
"Hold
on,"
Sophie
said.
"You
told
me
the
Holy
Grail
is
a
woman.
The
Last
Supper
is
a
painting
of
thirteen
men."
"Is
it?"
Teabing
arched
his
eyebrows.
"Take
a
closer
look."
Uncertain,
Sophie
made
her
way
closer
to
the
painting,
scanning
the
thirteen
figures
Jesus
Christ
in
the
middle,
six
disciples
on
His
left,
and
six
on
His
right.
"They're
all
men,"
she
confirmed.
"Oh?"
Teabing
said.
"How
about
the
one
seated
in
the
place
of
honor,
at
the
right
hand
of
the
Lord?"
Sophie
examined
the
figure
to
Jesus'
immediate
right,
focusing
in.
As
she
studied
the
person's
face
and
body,
a
wave
of
astonishment
rose
within
her.
The
individual
had
flowing
red
hair,
delicate
folded
hands,
and
the
hint
of
a
bosom.
It
was,
without
a
doubt
female.
"That's
a
woman!"
Sophie
exclaimed.
Teabing
was
laughing.
