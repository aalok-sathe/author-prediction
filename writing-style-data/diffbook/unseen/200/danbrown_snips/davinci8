capitaine
is
waiting,
sir."
Langdon
barely
heard
him.
His
eyes
were
still
riveted
on
the
picture.
"This
symbol
here,
and
the
way
his
body
is
so
oddly"
"Positioned?"
the
agent
offered.
Langdon
nodded,
feeling
a
chill
as
he
looked
up.
"I
can't
imagine
who
would
do
this

someone."
The
agent

residence.
Empty.
He
climbed
the
stairs
quietly,
not
wanting
to
awaken
any
of
his
fellow
numeraries.
His
bedroom
door
was
open;
locks
were
forbidden
here.
He
entered,
closing
the
door
behind

The
