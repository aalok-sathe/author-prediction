during
that
time
virtually
forbid
a
Jewish
man
to
be
unmarried.
According
to
Jewish
custom,
celibacy
was
condemned,
and
the
obligation
for
a
Jewish
father
was
to
find
a
suitable
wife
for
his
son.
If
Jesus
were
not
married,
at
least
one
of
the
Bible's
gospels
would
have
mentioned
it
and
offered
some
explanation
for
His
unnatural
state
of
bachelorhood."
Teabing
located
a
huge
book
and
pulled
it
toward
him
across
the
table.
The
leather
bound
edition
was
poster
sized,
like
a
huge
atlas.
The
cover
read:
The
Gnostic
Gospels.
Teabing
heaved
it
open,
and
Langdon
and
Sophie
joined
him.
Sophie
could
see
it
contained
photographs
of
what
appeared
to
be
magnified
passages
of
ancient
documents
tattered
papyrus
with
handwritten
text.
She
did
not
recognize
the
ancient
language,
but
the
facing
pages
bore
typed
translations.
"These
are
photocopies
of
the
Nag
Hammadi
and
Dead
Sea
scrolls,
which
I
mentioned
earlier,"
Teabing
said.
"The
earliest
Christian
records.
Troublingly,
they
do
not
match
up
with
the
gospels
in
the
Bible."
Flipping
toward
the
middle
of
the
book,
Teabing
pointed
to
a
passage.
"The
Gospel
of
Philip
is
always
a
good
place
to
start."
Sophie
read
the
passage:
And
the
companion
of
