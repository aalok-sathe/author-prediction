slept.
It
was
a
scream
of
anguish
that
startled
the
ghost
from
his
slumber.
His
body
leapt
out
of
bed,
staggered
down
a
hallway
toward
the
sounds
of
shouting.
He
entered
into
a
kitchen
and
saw
a
large
man
beating
a
smaller
man.
Without
knowing
why,
the
ghost
grabbed
the
large
man
and
hurled
him
backward
against
a
wall.
The
man
fled,
leaving
the
ghost
standing
over
the
body
of
a
young
man
in
priest's
robes.
The
priest
had
a
badly
shattered
nose.
Lifting
the
bloody
priest,
the
ghost
carried
him
to
a
couch.
"Thank
you,
my
friend,"
the
priest
said
in
awkward
French.
"The
offertory
money
is
tempting
for
thieves.
You
speak
French
in
your
sleep.
Do
you
also
speak
Spanish?"
The
ghost
shook
his
head.
"What
is
your
name?"
he
continued
in
broken
French.
The
ghost
could
not
remember
the
name
his
parents
had
given
him.
All
he
heard
were
the
taunting
gibes
of
the
prison
guards.
The
priest
smiled.
"No
hay
problema.
My
name
is
Manuel
Aringarosa.
I
am
a
missionary
from
Madrid.
I
was
sent
here
to
build
a
church
for
the
Obra
de
Dios."
"Where
am
I?"
His
voice
sounded
hollow.
"Oviedo.
In
the
north
