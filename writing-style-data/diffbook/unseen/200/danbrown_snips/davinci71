critical
juncture.
He
gave
Langdon
a
calm
look
of
apology.
"One
moment
please."
He
pulled
the
phone
from
his
belt
and
pressed
the
radio
transmission
button.
"Oui?"
"Capitaine,
un
agent
du
Departement
de
Cryptographic
est
arrive.
Fache's
anger
stalled
momentarily.
A
cryptographer?
Despite
the
lousy
timing,
this
was
probably
good
news.
Fache,
after
finding
Sauniere's
cryptic
text
on
the
floor,
had
uploaded
photographs
of
the
entire
crime
scene
to
the
Cryptography
Department
in
hopes
someone
there
could
tell
him
what
the
hell
Sauniere
was
trying
to
say.
If
a
code
breaker
had
now
arrived,
it
most
likely
meant
someone
had
decrypted
Sauniere's
message.
"I'm
busy
at
the
moment,"
Fache
radioed
back,
leaving
no
doubt
in
his
tone
that
a
line
had
been
crossed.
"Ask
the
cryptographer
to
wait
at
the
command
post.
I'll
speak
to
him
when
I'm
done."
"Her,
"
the
voice
corrected.
"It's
Agent
Neveu."
Fache
was
becoming
less
amused
with
this
call
every
passing
moment.
Sophie
Neveu
was
one
of
DCPJ's
biggest
mistakes.
A
young
Parisian
dechiffreuse
who
had
studied
cryptography
in
England
at
the
Royal
Holloway,
Sophie
Neveu
had
been
foisted
on
Fache
two
years
ago
as
part
of
the
ministry's
attempt
to
incorporate
more
women
