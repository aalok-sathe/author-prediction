left,
across
the
Seine,
the
illuminated
Eiffel
Tower.
Straight
ahead,
the
Arc
de
Triomphe.
And
to
the
right,
high
atop
the
sloping
rise
of
Montmartre,
the
graceful
arabesque
dome
of
Sacre
Coeur,
its
polished
stone
glowing
white
like
a
resplendent
sanctuary.
Here
at
the
westernmost
tip
of
the
Denon
Wing,
the
north
south
thoroughfare
of
Place
du
Carrousel
ran
almost
flush
with
the
building
with
only
a
narrow
sidewalk
separating
it
from
the
Louvre's
outer
wall.
Far
below,
the
usual
caravan
of
the
city's
nighttime
delivery
trucks
sat
idling,
waiting
for
the
signals
to
change,
their
running
lights
seeming
to
twinkle
mockingly
up
at
Sophie.
"I
don't
know
what
to
say,"
Langdon
said,
coming
up
behind
her.
"Your
grandfather
is
obviously
trying
to
tell
us
something.
I'm
sorry
I'm
so
little
help."
Sophie
turned
from
the
window,
sensing
a
sincere
regret
in
Langdon's
deep
voice.
Even
with
all
the
trouble
around
him,
he
obviously
wanted
to
help
her.
The
teacher
in
him,
she
thought,
having
read
DCPJ's
workup
on
their
suspect.
This
was
an
academic
who
clearly
despised
not
understanding.
We
have
that
in
common,
she
thought.
As
a
codebreaker,
Sophie
made
her
living
extracting
meaning
from
seemingly
senseless
data.
