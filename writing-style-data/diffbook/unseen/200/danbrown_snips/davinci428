restrain
this
monster."
"And
some
ice!"
Sophie
called
after
him.
Langdon
drifted
out
again.
More
voices.
Movement.
Now
he
was
seated
on
the
divan.
Sophie
was
holding
an
ice
pack
to
his
head.
His
skull
ached.
As
Langdon's
vision
finally
began
to
clear,
he
found
himself
staring
at
a
body
on
the
floor.
Am

hallucinating?
The
massive
body
of
an
albino
monk
lay
bound
and
gagged
with
duct
tape.
His
chin
was
split

and

a
minute,
Robert."
"I
fear,"
Teabing
said,
"that
I've
just
demonstrated
for
your
lady
friend
the
unfortunate
benefit
of
my
condition.
It
seems
everyone
underestimates
you."
From
his
seat
on
the
divan,
Langdon
gazed
down
at
the
monk
and
tried
to
imagine
what
had
happened.
"He
was
wearing
a
cilice,
"
Teabing
explained.
"A
what?"
Teabing
pointed
to

bloody
strip
of
barbed
leather
