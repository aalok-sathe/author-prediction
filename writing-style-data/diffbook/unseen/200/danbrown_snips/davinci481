one
of
the
bearer
bonds.
He
handed
it
to
the
pilot.
"What
is
this?"
the
pilot
demanded.
"A
ten
thousand
euro
bearer
bond
drawn
on
the
Vatican
Bank."
The
pilot
looked
dubious.
"It's
the
same
as
cash."
"Only
cash
is
cash,"
the
pilot
said,
handing
the
bond
back.
Aringarosa
felt
weak
as
he
steadied
himself
against
the
cockpit
door.
"This
is
a
matter
of
life
or
death.
You
must
help
me.
I
need
to
get
to
London."
The
pilot
eyed
the
bishop's
gold
ring.
"Real
diamonds?"
Aringarosa
looked
at
the
ring.
"I
could
not
possibly
part
with
this."
The
pilot
shrugged,
turning
and
focusing
back
out
the
windshield.
Aringarosa
felt
a
deepening
sadness.
He
looked
at
the
ring.
Everything
it
represented
was
about
to
be
lost
to
the
bishop
anyway.
After
a
long
moment,
he
slid
the
ring
from
his
finger
and
placed
it
gently
on
the
instrument
panel.
Aringarosa
slunk
out
of
the
cockpit
and
sat
back
down.
Fifteen
seconds
later,
he
could
feel
the
pilot
banking
a
few
more
degrees
to
the
north.
Even
so,
Aringarosa's
moment
of
glory
was
in
shambles.
It
had
all
begun
as
a
holy
cause.
A
brilliantly
crafted
scheme.
Now,
like
a
house
