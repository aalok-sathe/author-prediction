to
have
invested
his
entire
savings
in
the
technology
craze
a
few
years
back
and
lost
his
shirt.
And
Fache
is
a
man
who
wears
only
the
finest
shirts.
Tonight,
there
was
still
plenty
of
time.
Sophie
Neveu's
odd
interruption,
though
unfortunate,
had
been
only
a
minor
wrinkle.
She
was
gone
now,
and
Fache
still
had
cards
to
play.
He
had
yet
to
inform
Langdon
that
his
name
had
been
scrawled
on
the
floor
by
the
victim.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
The
American's
reaction
to
that
little
bit
of
evidence
would
be
telling
indeed.
"Captain?"
one
of
the
DCPJ
agents
now
called
from
across
the
office.
"I
think
you
better
take
this
call."
He
was
holding
out
a
telephone
receiver,
looking
concerned.
"Who
is
it?"
Fache
said.
The
agent
frowned.
"It's
the
director
of
our
Cryptology
Department."
"And?"
"It's
about
Sophie
Neveu,
sir.
Something
is
not
quite
right."
It
was
time.
Silas
felt
strong
as
he
stepped
from
the
black
Audi,
the
nighttime
breeze
rustling
his
loose
fitting
robe.
The
winds
of
change
are
in
the
air.
He
knew
the
task
before
him
would
require
more
finesse
than
force,
and
he
left
his
handgun
in
the
car.
The
thirteen
