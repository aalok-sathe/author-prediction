To

the

octagonal

emerged,
looking
like
a

island
on
the
empty

Langdon
could
now
begin
to
see
the
panel
of
dark
glass
on
the
wall.
Behind
it,
he
knew,
in
the
confines
of
her
own
private
cell,
hung
the
most
celebrated
painting
in
the
world.
The
Mona
Lisa
's
status
as
the
most
famous
piece
of
art
in
the
world,
Langdon
knew,
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
enigmatic
smile.
Nor
was
it
due

the
mysterious
interpretations

Quite
simply,
the
Mona

was
famous
because
Leonardo

He
carried
the
painting
with
him
whenever
he
traveled
and,
if
asked
why,
would
reply
that
he
found
it
hard
to
part
with
his
most
sublime
expression
of
female
beauty.
Even
so,
many
art
historians
suspected
Da
Vinci's
reverence
for
the
Mona
Lisa
had
nothing
to
do
with
its
artistic
mastery.
In
actuality,
the
painting
was
a
surprisingly
ordinary
sfumato
portrait.
Da
Vinci's
veneration
for
this
work,
many
claimed,
stemmed
from
something
far
deeper:
a
hidden
message
in
the
layers
of
paint.
