belt.
The
podium
had
a
familiar
triangular
hole.
"Once
the
computer
confirms
the
markings
on
your
key,
you
enter
your
account
number,
and
your
safe
deposit
box
will
be
retrieved
robotically
from
the
vault
below
for
your
inspection.
When
you
are
finished
with
your
box,
you
place
it
back
on
the
conveyor
belt,
insert
your
key
again,
and
the
process
is
reversed.
Because
everything
is
automated,
your
privacy
is
guaranteed,
even
from
the
staff
of
this
bank.
If
you
need
anything
at
all,
simply
press
the
call
button
on
the
table
in
the
center
of
the

when
a
telephone
rang.
The
man
looked
puzzled
and
embarrassed.
"Excuse
me,
please."
He
walked
over
to
the
phone,
which
was
sitting
on
the
table
beside
the
coffee
and
Perrier.
"Oui?"
he
answered.
His
brow
furrowed
as
he
listened
to
the
caller.
"Oui
oui
d'
accord.
"
He
hung
up,
and
gave
them
an
uneasy
smile.
"I'm
sorry,
I
must
leave
you
now.
Make
yourselves
at
home."
He
moved
quickly
toward
the
door.
"Excuse
me,"
Sophie
called.
"Could
you
clarify
something
before
you
go?
You
mentioned
that
we
enter
an
account
number?"
