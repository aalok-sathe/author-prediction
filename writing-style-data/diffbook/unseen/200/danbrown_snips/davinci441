I
expect
you
will
join
me
there
permanently.
I'm
planning
to
buy
a
splendid
villa
in
Devonshire,
and
we'll
have
all
your
things
shipped
up
immediately.
An
adventure,
Remy.
I
say,
an
adventure!"
Langdon
had
to
smile.
As
Teabing
railed
on
about
his
plans
for
a
triumphant
return
to
Britain,
Langdon
felt
himself
caught
up
in
the
man's
infectious
enthusiasm.
Gazing
absently
out
the
window,
Langdon
watched
the
woods
passing
by,
ghostly
pale
in
the
yellow
blush
of
the
fog
lights.
The
side
mirror
was
tipped
inward,
brushed

by
branches,
and
Langdon
saw
the
reflection

Sophie
sitting
quietly
in
the
back

He
watched
her
for
a
long

and
felt
an
unexpected
upwelling

contentment.
Despite
his
troubles
tonight,
Langdon
was
thankful
to

such
good
company.
After
several
minutes,
as
if
suddenly
sensing
his
eyes
on
her,
Sophie
leaned
forward
and
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders,
giving
him
a
quick
rub.
"You
okay?"
"Yeah,"
Langdon
said.
"Somehow."
Sophie
sat
back
in
her
seat,
and
Langdon
saw
a
quiet
smile
cross
her
lips.
He
realized
that
he
too
was
now
grinning.
Wedged
in
the
back
of
the
Range
Rover,
Silas
could
barely
breathe.
His
