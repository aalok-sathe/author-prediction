Andre
Vernet
looked
equally
astounded,
steadying
himself
by
leaning
on
an
end
table.
"Jacques
and
I
were
dear
friends.
When
did
this
happen?"
"Earlier
this
evening.
Inside
the
Louvre."
Vernet
walked
to
a
deep
leather
chair
and
sank
into
it.
"I
need
to
ask
you
both
a
very
important
question."
He
glanced
up
at
Langdon
and
then
back
to
Sophie.
"Did
either
of
you
have
anything
to
do
with
his
death?"
"No!"
Sophie
declared.
"Absolutely
not."
Vernet's
face
was
grim,
and
he
paused,
pondering.
"Your
pictures
are
being
circulated
by
Interpol.
This
is
how
I
recognized
you.
You're
wanted
for
a
murder."
Sophie
slumped.
Fache
ran
an
Interpol
broadcast
already?
It
seemed
the
captain
was
more
motivated
than
Sophie
had
anticipated.
She
quickly
told
Vernet
who
Langdon
was
and
what
had
happened
inside
the
Louvre
tonight.
Vernet
looked
amazed.
"And
as
your
grandfather
was
dying,
he
left
you
a
message
telling
you
to
find
Mr.
Langdon?"
"Yes.
And
this
key."
Sophie
laid
the
gold
key
on
the
coffee
table
in
front
of
Vernet,
placing
the
Priory
seal
face
down.
Vernet
glanced
at
the
key
but
made
no
move
to
touch
it.
"He
left
you
only
this
key?
Nothing
else?
No
