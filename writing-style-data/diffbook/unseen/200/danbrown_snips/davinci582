The
bell
was
a
common
feature
in
these
halls
where
the
residents
spent
most
of
the
day
in
their
rooms
in
prayer.
Silas
could
hear
movement
above
on
the
creaky
wood
floors.
A
man
in
a
cloak
came
downstairs.
"May
I
help
you?"
He
had
kind
eyes
that
seemed
not
even
to
register
Silas's
startling
physical
appearance.
"Thank
you.
My
name
is
Silas.
I
am
an
Opus

numerary."
"American?"
Silas
nodded.
"I
am
in
town
only
for
the
day.
Might
I
rest
here?"
"You
need
not
even
ask.
There
are
two
empty
rooms
on
the
third
floor.
Shall
I
bring
you
some
tea
and
bread?"
"Thank
you."
Silas
was
famished.
Silas
went
upstairs
to

with
a

where
he
took
off
his
wet
robe
and
knelt
down
to
pray
in
his
undergarments.
He
heard
his
host
come
up
and
lay
a
tray
outside
his
door.
Silas
finished
his
prayers,
ate
his
food,
and
lay
down
to
sleep.
Three
stories
below,
a
phone
was
ringing.
The
Opus
Dei
numerary
who
had
welcomed
Silas
answered
the
line.
"This
is
the
London
police,"
the
caller
said.
"We
are
trying
to
find
an
albino
monk.
We've
had
a
tip
off
