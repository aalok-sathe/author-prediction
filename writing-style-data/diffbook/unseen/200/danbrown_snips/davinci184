bravado.
She's
still
inside
the
building?
"Handle
it,"
Fache
ordered.
"I
want
Langdon
and
Neveu
at
gunpoint
by
the
time
I
get
back."
As
the
Trailor
truck
drove
off,
Captain
Fache
rounded
up
his
men.
Robert
Langdon
had
proven
an
elusive
quarry
tonight,
and
with
Agent
Neveu
now
helping
him,
he
might
be
far
harder
to
corner
than
expected.
Fache
decided
not
to
take
any
chances.
Hedging
his
bets,
he
ordered
half
of
his
men
back
to
the
Louvre
perimeter.
The
other
half
he
sent
to
guard
the
only
location
in
Paris
where
Robert
Langdon
could
find
safe
harbor.
Inside
the
Salle
des
Etats,
Langdon
stared
in
astonishment
at
the
six
words
glowing
on
the
Plexiglas.
The
text
seemed
to
hover
in
space,
casting
a
jagged
shadow
across
Mona
Lisa's
mysterious
smile.
"The
Priory,"
Langdon
whispered.
"This
proves
your
grandfather
was
a
member!"
Sophie
looked
at
him
in
confusion.
"You
understand
this?"
"It's
flawless,"
Langdon
said,
nodding
as
his
thoughts
churned.
"It's
a
proclamation
of
one
of
the
Priory's
most
fundamental
philosophies!"
Sophie
looked
baffled
in
the
glow
of
the
message
scrawled
across
the
Mona
Lisa's
face.
SO
DARK
THE
CON
OF
MAN
"Sophie,"
Langdon
said,
"the
Priory's
tradition
