mind.
The
key
to
the
Grail
is
hidden
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
Langdon
held
the
wooden
box
up
to
the
light
and
examined
the
inlaid
symbol
of
the
Rose.
Although
his
familiarity
with
art
did
not
include
woodworking
or
inlaid
furniture,
he
had
just
recalled
the
famous
tiled
ceiling
of
the
Spanish
monastery
outside
of
Madrid,
where,
three
centuries
after
its
construction,
the
ceiling
tiles
began
to
fall
out,
revealing
sacred
texts
scrawled
by
monks
on
the
plaster
beneath.
Langdon
looked
again
at
the
Rose.
Beneath
the
Rose.
Sub
Rosa.
Secret.
A
bump
in
the
hallway
behind
him
made
Langdon
turn.
He
saw
nothing
but
shadows.
Teabing's
manservant
most
likely
had
passed
through.
Langdon
turned
back
to
the
box.
He
ran
his
finger
over
the
smooth
edge
of
the
inlay,
wondering
if
he
could
pry
the
Rose
out,
but
the
craftsmanship
was
perfect.
He
doubted
even
a
razor
blade
could
fit
in
between
the
inlaid
Rose
and
the
carefully
carved
depression
into
which
it
was
seated.
Opening
the
box,
he
examined
the
inside
of
the
lid.
It
was
smooth.
As
he
shifted
its
position,
though,
the
light
caught
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
hole
on
the
underside
