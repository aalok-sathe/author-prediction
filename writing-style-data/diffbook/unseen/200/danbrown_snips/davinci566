are
obviously
a
man
of
great
culture
and
refinement.
I
would
imagine
you
are
a
man
of
honor,
as
well.
As
am
I.
That
said,
I
give
you
my
word
as
commanding
officer
of
the
Police
Judiciaire
that
your
box,
along
with
your
bank's
reputation,
are
in
the
safest
of
hands."
High
in
the
hayloft
at
Chateau
Villette,
Collet
stared
at
the
computer
monitor
in
amazement.
"This
system
is
eavesdropping
on
all
these
locations?"
"Yes,"
the
agent
said.
"It
looks
like
data
has
been
collected
for
over
a
year
now."
Collet
read
the
list
again,
speechless.

The
agent
pointed
to
the
screen.
"Number
four
is
of
obvious
concern."
Collet
nodded
blankly.
He
had
noticed
it
immediately.
Jacques
Sauniere
was
being
bugged.
He
looked
at
the
rest
of
the
list
again.
How
could
anyone
possibly
manage
to
bug
these
prominent
people?
"Have
you
heard
any
of
the
audio
files?"
"A
few.
Here's
one
of
the
most
recent."
The
agent
clicked
a
few
computer
keys.
The
speakers
crackled
