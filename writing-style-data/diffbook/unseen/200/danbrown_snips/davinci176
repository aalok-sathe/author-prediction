sfumato
style,
in
which
forms
appear
to
evaporate
into
one
another.
Since
taking
up
residence
in
the
Louvre,
the
Mona
Lisa
or
La
Jaconde
as
they
call
her
in
France
had
been
stolen
twice,
most
recently
in
1911,
when
she
disappeared
from
the
Louvre's
"satte
impenetrable"
Le
Salon
Carre.
Parisians
wept
in
the
streets
and
wrote
newspaper
articles
begging
the
thieves
for
the
painting's
return.
Two
years
later,
the
Mona
Lisa
was
discovered
hidden
in
the
false
bottom
of
a
trunk
in
a
Florence
hotel
room.
Langdon,
now
having
made
it
clear
to
Sophie
that
he
had
no
intention
of
leaving,
moved
with
her
across
the
Salle
des
Etats.
The
Mona
Lisa
was
still
twenty
yards
ahead
when
Sophie
turned
on
the
black
light,
and
the
bluish
crescent
of
penlight
fanned
out
on
the
floor
in
front
of
them.
She
swung
the
beam
back
and
forth
across
the
floor
like
a
minesweeper,
searching
for
any
hint
of
luminescent
ink.
Walking
beside
her,
Langdon
was
already
feeling
the
tingle
of
anticipation
that
accompanied
his
face
to
face
reunions
with
great
works
of
art.
He
strained
to
see
beyond
the
cocoon
of
purplish
light
emanating
from
the
black
light
in
Sophie's
hand.
