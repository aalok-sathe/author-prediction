bed.
I
can
enjoy
your
sanctuary
and
then
let
myself
out."
She
looked
uneasy.
"Are
you
sure
you
won't
feel
abandoned?"
"Not
at
all.
Prayer
is
a
solitary
joy."
"As
you
wish."
Silas
took
his
hand
from
her
shoulder.
"Sleep
well,
Sister.
May
the
peace
of
the
Lord
be
with
you."
"And
also
with
you."
Sister
Sandrine
headed
for
the
stairs.
"Please
be
sure
the
door
closes
tightly
on
your
way
out."
"I
will
be
sure
of
it."
Silas
watched
her
climb
out
of
sight.
Then
he
turned
and
knelt
in
the
front
pew,
feeling
the
cilice
cut
into
his
leg.
Dear
God,
I
offer
up
to
you
this
work
I
do
today.
Crouching
in
the
shadows
of
the
choir
balcony
high
above
the
altar,
Sister
Sandrine
peered
silently
through
the
balustrade
at
the
cloaked
monk
kneeling
alone.
The
sudden
dread
in
her
soul
made
it
hard
to
stay
still.
For
a
fleeting
instant,
she
wondered
if
this
mysterious
visitor
could
be
the
enemy
they
had
warned
her
about,
and
if
tonight
she
would
have
to
carry
out
the
orders
she
had
been
holding
all
these
years.
She
decided
to
stay
there
in
the
darkness
and
watch
his
every
move.
