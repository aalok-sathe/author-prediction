It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
Langdon
felt
a
shiver
of
potential.
He
had
not
considered
the
line
that
way
before.
"You
told
me
earlier,"
she
said,
"that
the
timing
of
the
Priory's
plans
to
unveil
the
truth
about
'the
Rose'
and
her

was
linked
directly
to
the
position
of

Langdon
nodded,

the

materializing.
Even

astronomy
was

the
key.
The

also
crystal

If
this
solution
were
anything

the
others,
it
would
be
painfully

dawned.
"Look!"
Sophie
gasped,
jarring
his
thoughts
as
she
grabbed

arm.
From
the
