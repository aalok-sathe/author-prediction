off.
As
Langdon
stood
alone
and
watched
the
departing
taillights,
he
realized
he
could
easily
reconsider,
exit
the
courtyard,
grab
a
taxi,
and
head
home
to
bed.
Something
told
him
it
was
probably
a
lousy
idea.
As
he
moved
toward
the
mist
of
the
fountains,
Langdon
had
the
uneasy
sense
he
was
crossing
an
imaginary
threshold
into
another
world.
The
dreamlike
quality
of
the
evening
was
settling
around
him
again.
Twenty
minutes
ago
he
had
been
asleep
in
his
hotel
room.
Now
he
was
standing
in
front
of
a
transparent
pyramid
built
by
the
Sphinx,
waiting
for
a
policeman
they
called
the
Bull.
I'm
trapped
in
a
Salvador
Dali
painting,
he
thought.
Langdon
strode
to
the
main
entrance
an
enormous
revolving
door.
The
foyer
beyond
was
dimly
lit
and
deserted.
Do
I
knock?
Langdon
wondered
if
any
of
Harvard's
revered
Egyptologists
had
ever
knocked
on
the
front
door
of
a
pyramid
and
expected
an
answer.
He
raised
his
hand
to
bang
on
the
glass,
but
out
of
the
darkness
below,
a
figure
appeared,
striding
up
the
curving
staircase.
The
man
was
stocky
and
dark,
almost
Neanderthal,
dressed
in
a
dark
double
breasted
suit
that
strained
to
cover
his
wide
shoulders.
