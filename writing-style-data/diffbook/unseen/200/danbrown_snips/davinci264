for
the
hour.
We're
on
different
time
zones.
You
must
be
tired."
"Not
at
all,"
the
secretariat
said,
his
hands
folded
on
his
enormous
belly.
"We
are
grateful
you
have
come
so
far.
The
least
we
can
do
is
be
awake
to
meet
you.
Can
we
offer
you
some
coffee
or
refreshments?"
"I'd
prefer
we
don't
pretend
this
is
a
social
visit.
I
have
another
plane
to
catch.
Shall
we
get
to
business?"
"Of
course,"
the
secretariat
said.
"You
have
acted
more
quickly
than
we
imagined."
"Have
I?"
"You
still
have
a
month."
"You
made
your
concerns
known
five
months
ago,"
Aringarosa
said.
"Why
should
I
wait?"
"Indeed.
We
are
very
pleased
with
your
expediency."
Aringarosa's
eyes
traveled
the
length
of
the
long
table
to
a
large
black
briefcase.
"Is
that
what
I
requested?"
"It
is."
The
secretariat
sounded
uneasy.
"Although,
I
must
admit,
we
are
concerned
with
the
request.
It
seems
quite"
"Dangerous,"
one
of
the
cardinals
finished.
"Are
you
certain
we
cannot
wire
it
to
you
somewhere?
The
sum
is
exorbitant."
Freedom
is
expensive.
"I
have
no
concerns
for
my
own
safety.
God
is
with
me."
The
men
actually
looked
doubtful.
"The
funds
are
exactly
as
I
requested?"
