the
end
of
his
patience.
"Captain,
you
asked
for
my
instincts
as
to
what
Sauniere
is
trying
to
say
here,
and
that's
what
I'm
giving
you."
"That
this
is
an
indictment
of
the
Church?"
Fache's
jaw
tightened
as
he
spoke
through
clenched
teeth.
"Mr.
Langdon,
I
have
seen
a
lot
of
death
in
my
work,
and
let
me
tell
you
something.
When
a
man
is
murdered
by
another
man,
I
do
not
believe
his
final
thoughts
are
to
write
an
obscure
spiritual
statement
that
no
one
will
understand.
I
believe
he
is
thinking
of
one
thing
only."
Fache's
whispery
voice
sliced
the
air.
"La
vengeance.
I
believe
Sauniere
wrote
this
note
to
tell
us
who
killed
him."
Langdon
stared.
"But
that
makes
no
sense
whatsoever."
"No?"
"No,"
he
fired
back,
tired
and
frustrated.
"You
told
me
Sauniere
was
attacked
in
his
office
by
someone
he
had
apparently
invited
in."
"Yes."
"So
it
seems
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
curator
knew
his
attacker."
Fache
nodded.
"Go
on."
"So
if
Sauniere
knew
the
person
who
killed
him,
what
kind
of
indictment
is
this?"
He
pointed
at
the
floor.
"Numeric
codes?
Lame
saints?
Draconian
devils?
Pentacles
on
his
stomach?
It's
all
too
cryptic."
