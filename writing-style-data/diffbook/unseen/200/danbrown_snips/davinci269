the
screen
was
a
triangular
hole.
"Something
tells
me
it
will
fit,"
Langdon
said.
Sophie
aligned
the
key's
triangular
shaft
with
the
hole
and
inserted
it,
sliding
it
in
until
the
entire
shaft
had
disappeared.
This
key
apparently
required
no
turning.
Instantly,
the
gate
began
to
swing
open.
Sophie
took
her
foot
off
the
brake
and
coasted
down
to
a
second
gate
and
podium.
Behind
her,
the
first
gate
closed,
trapping
them
like
a
ship
in
a
lock.
Langdon
disliked
the
constricted
sensation.
Let's
hope
this
second
gate
works
too.
This
second
podium
bore
familiar
directions.
INSERT
KEY.
When
Sophie
inserted
the
key,
the
second
gate
immediately
opened.
Moments
later
they
were
winding
down
the
ramp
into
the
belly
of
the
structure.
The
private
garage
was
small
and
dim,
with
spaces
for
about
a
dozen
cars.
At
the
far
end,
Langdon
spied
the
building's
main
entrance.
A
red
carpet
stretched
across
the
cement
floor,
welcoming
visitors
to
a
huge
door
that
appeared
to
be
forged
of
solid
metal.
Talk
about
mixed
messages,
Langdon
thought.
Welcome
and
keep
out.
Sophie
pulled
the
taxi
into
a
parking
space
near
the
entrance
and
killed
the
engine.
"You'd
better
leave
the
gun
here."
