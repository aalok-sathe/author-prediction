Silas
didn't
mind
the
walk.
The
rain
was
cleansing.
At
Remy's
suggestion,
Silas
had
wiped
down
his
gun
and
disposed
of
it
through
a
sewer
grate.
He
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
it.
He
felt
lighter.
His
legs
still
ached
from
being
bound
all
that
time,
but
Silas
had
endured
far
greater
pain.
He
wondered,
though,
about
Teabing,
whom
Remy
had
left
bound
in
the
back
of
the
limousine.
The
Briton
certainly
had
to
be
feeling
the
pain
by
now.
"What
will
you
do
with
him?"
Silas
had
asked
Remy
as
they
drove
over
here.
Remy
had
shrugged.
"That
is
a
decision
for
the
Teacher."
There
was
an
odd
finality
in
his
tone.
Now,
as
Silas
approached
the
Opus
Dei
building,
the
rain
began
to
fall
harder,
soaking
his
heavy
robe,
stinging
the
wounds
of
the
day
before.
He
was
ready
to
leave
behind
the
sins
of
the
last
twenty
four
hours
and
purge
his
soul.
His
work
was
done.
Moving
across
a
small
courtyard
to
the
front
door,
Silas
was
not
surprised
to
find
the
door
unlocked.
He
opened
it
and
stepped
into
the
minimalist
foyer.
A
muted
electronic
chime
sounded
upstairs
as
Silas
stepped
onto
the
carpet.
