herself

back.
"Good
luck,
Robert."
When
Langdon
reached
the
landing
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs,
the
unmistakable
smell
of
linseed
oil
and
plaster
dust
assaulted
his
nostrils.
Ahead,
an
illuminated
SORTIEEXIT
displayed
an
arrow
pointing
down
a
long
corridor.
Langdon
stepped
into
the
hallway.
To
the
right
gaped
a
murky
restoration
studio
out
of
which
peered
an
army
of
statues
in
various
states
of
repair.
To
the
left,
Langdon
saw
a
suite
of
studios
that
resembled
Harvard
art
classrooms
rows
of
easels,
paintings,
palettes,
framing
tools
an
art
assembly
line.
As
he
moved
down
the
hallway,
Langdon
wondered
if
at
any
moment
he
might
awake
with
a
start
in
his
bed
in
Cambridge.
The
entire
evening
had
felt
like
a
bizarre
dream.
I'm
about
to
dash
out
of
the
Louvre
a
fugitive.
Sauniere's
clever
anagrammatic
message
was
still
on
his
mind,
and
Langdon
wondered
what
Sophie
would
find
at
the
Mona
Lisa
if
anything.
She
had
seemed
certain
her
grandfather
meant
for
her
to
visit
the
famous
painting
one
more
time.
As
plausible
an
interpretation
as
this
seemed,
Langdon
felt
haunted
now
by
a
troubling
paradox.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
Sauniere
had
written
Langdon's
name
on
the
floor,
