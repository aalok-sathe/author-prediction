interest,
but
that
topic
was
something
he
would
discuss
with
Sophie
when
they
were
alone.
"So,"
Sophie
said,
"you
lied
to
Captain
Fache."
"What?"
Langdon
demanded.
"You
told
him
you
had
never
corresponded
with
my
grandfather."
"I
didn't!
My
editor
sent
him
a
manuscript."
"Think
about
it,
Robert.
If
Captain
Fache
didn't
find
the
envelope
in
which
your
editor
sent
the

you
sent
it."

"That's
Elizabeth?"
Teabing
grinned.
"Beats
the
bloody
Chunnel."
The
man
in
khakis
hurried
toward
them,
squinting
into
the
headlights.
"Almost
ready,
sir,"
he
called
in
a
British
accent.
"My
apologies
for
the
delay,
but
you
took
me
by
surprise
and

He
stopped
short
as
the
group
unloaded.
He
looked
