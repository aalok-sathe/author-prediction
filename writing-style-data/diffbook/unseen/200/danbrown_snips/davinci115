"His
secretary
set
the
meeting
and
didn't
offer
any
specific
reason,
and
I
didn't
ask.
I
assumed
he'd
heard
I
would
be
lecturing
on
the
pagan
iconography
of
French
cathedrals,
was
interested
in
the
topic,
and
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
meet
for
drinks
after
the
talk."
Sophie
didn't
buy
it.
The
connection
was
flimsy.
Her
grandfather
knew
more
about
pagan
iconography
than
anyone
else
on

Moreover,

an
exceptionally
private
man,
not
someone
prone

with

Sophie
took

now
clouded
with
concern.
"No,
but
considering
what
just
happened"
Sophie
nodded.
Considering
tonight's
events,
she
would
be
a
fool
not
to
be
frightened.
Feeling
drained,
she
walked
to
the
small
plate
glass
window
at
the
far
end
of
the
bathroom
and
gazed
out
in
silence
through
the
mesh
of
alarm
tape
embedded
in
the
glass.
They
were
high
up
forty
feet
at
least.
Sighing,
she
raised
her
eyes
and
gazed
out
at
Paris's
dazzling
landscape.
On
