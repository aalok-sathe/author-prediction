need
to
cooperate,
Agent
Neveu.
We
both
have
a
lot
to
lose
here.
This
is
damage
control.
I
made
errors
in
judgment
last
night,
and
if
those
errors
result
in
the
deaths
of
an
American
professor
and
a
DCPJ
cryptologist,
my
career
will
be
over.
I've
been
trying
to
pull
you
back
into
safety
for
the
last
several
hours."
A
warm
wind
was
now
pushing
through
the
station
as
a
train
approached
with
a
low
rumble.
Sophie
had
every
intention
of
being
on

Langdon

kidnapped
Teabing
inside
the
Temple
Church
and

into
the
station.
"This
is
not
something
to
discuss
on
an
open
line.
You
and
Langdon
will
come
in
now.
For
your
own
well
being!
That
is
a
direct
order!"
Sophie
hung
up
and
dashed
with
Langdon
onto
the
train.
The
immaculate
cabin
of
Teabing's
Hawker
was
now
covered
with
steel
shavings
and
smelled
of
compressed
air
and
propane.
Bezu
Fache
had
sent
