At
the
top
of
the
stairs,
a
form
moved
in
the
shadows,
only
his
silhouette
visible.
"Good
evening,"
Langdon
called
up.
"Sir
Leigh,
may
I
present
Sophie
Neveu."
"An
honor."
Teabing
moved
into
the
light.
"Thank
you
for
having
us,"
Sophie
said,
now
seeing
the
man
wore
metal
leg
braces
and
used
crutches.
He
was
coming
down
one
stair
at
a
time.
"I
realize
it's
quite
late."
"It
is
so
late,
my
dear,
it's
early."
He
laughed.
"Vous
n'etes
pas
Americaine?"
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"Parisienne.
"Your
English
is
superb."
"Thank
you.
I
studied
at
the
Royal
Holloway."
"So
then,
that
explains
it."
Teabing
hobbled
lower
through
the
shadows.
"Perhaps
Robert
told
you
I
schooled
just
down
the
road
at
Oxford."
Teabing
fixed
Langdon
with
a
devilish
smile.
"Of
course,
I
also
applied
to
Harvard
as
my
safety
school."
Their
host
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs,
appearing
to
Sophie
no
more
like
a
knight
than
Sir
Elton
John.
Portly
and
ruby
faced,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
had
bushy
red
hair
and
jovial
hazel
eyes
that
seemed
to
twinkle
as
he
spoke.
He
wore
pleated
pants
and
a
roomy
silk
shirt
under
a
paisley
vest.
Despite
the
aluminum
braces
on
