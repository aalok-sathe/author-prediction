structure
of
the
human
body.
Da
Vinci
actually
exhumed
corpses
to
measure
the
exact
proportions
of
human
bone
structure.
He
was
the
first
to
show
that
the
human
body
is
literally
made
of
building
blocks
whose
proportional
ratios
always
equal
PHI."
Everyone
in
class
gave
him
a
dubious
look.
"Don't
believe
me?"
Langdon
challenged.
"Next
time
you're
in
the
shower,
take
a
tape
measure."
A
couple
of
football
players
snickered.
"Not
just
you
insecure
jocks,"
Langdon
prompted.
"All
of
you.
Guys
and
girls.
Try
it.
Measure
the
distance
from
the
tip
of
your
head
to
the
floor.
Then
divide
that
by
the
distance
from
your
belly
button
to
the
floor.
Guess
what
number
you
get."
"Not
PHI!"
one
of
the
jocks
blurted
out
in
disbelief.
"Yes,
PHI,"
Langdon
replied.
"One
point
six
one
eight.
Want
another
example?
Measure
the
distance
from
your
shoulder
to
your
fingertips,
and
then
divide
it
by
the
distance
from
your
elbow
to
your
fingertips.
PHI
again.
Another?
Hip
to
floor
divided
by
knee
to
floor.
PHI
again.
Finger
joints.
Toes.
Spinal
divisions.
PHI.
PHI.
PHI.
My
friends,
each
of
you
is
a
walking
tribute
to
the
Divine
Proportion.
Even
in
the
darkness,
Langdon
