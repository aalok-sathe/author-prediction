carved
inlay
a
five
petal
rose.
He
had
seen
this
type
of
rose
many
times.
"The
five
petal
rose,"
he
whispered,
"is
a
Priory
symbol
for
the
Holy
Grail."
Sophie
turned
and
looked
at
him.
Langdon
could
see
what
she
was
thinking,
and
he
was
thinking
it
too.
The
dimensions
of
the
box,
the
apparent
weight
of
its
contents,
and
a
Priory
symbol
for
the
Grail
all
seemed
to
imply
one
unfathomable
conclusion.
The
Cup
of
Christ
is
in
this
wooden
box.
Langdon
again
told
himself
it
was
impossible.
"It's
a
perfect
size,"
Sophie
whispered,
"to
hold
a
chalice."
It
can
't
be
a
chalice.
Sophie
pulled
the
box
toward
her
across
the
table,
preparing
to
open
it.
As
she
moved
it,
though,
something
unexpected
happened.
The
box
let
out
an
odd
gurgling
sound.
Langdon
did
a
double
take.
There's
liquid
inside?
Sophie
looked
equally
confused.
"Did
you
just
hear?"
Langdon
nodded,
lost.
"Liquid."
Reaching
forward,
Sophie
slowly
unhooked
the
clasp
and
raised
the
lid.
The
object
inside
was
unlike
anything
Langdon
had
ever
seen.
One
thing
was
immediately
clear
to
both
of
them,
however.
This
was
definitely
not
the
Cup
of
Christ.
"The
police
are
blocking

street,"
