sprang

White

Black

Reaching
over,
Langdon
lifted
the
smaller
cryptex.
It
looked
identical
to
the
first,
except
half
the
size
and
black.
He
heard
the
familiar
gurgle.
Apparently,
the
vial
of
vinegar
they
had
heard
earlier
was
inside
this
smaller
cryptex.
"Well,
Robert,"
Teabing
said,
sliding
the
page
of
vellum
over
to
him.
"You'll
be
pleased
to
hear
that
at
least
we're
flying
in
the
right
direction."
Langdon
examined
the
thick
vellum
sheet.
Written
in
ornate
penmanship
was
another
four
line
verse.
Again,
in
iambic
pentameter.
The
verse
was
cryptic,
but
Langdon
needed
to
read
only
as
far
as
the
first
line
to
realize
that
Teabing's
plan
to
come
to
Britain
was
going
to
pay
off.
IN
LONDON
LIES
A
KNIGHT
A
POPE
INTERRED.
The
remainder
of
the
poem
clearly
implied
that
the
password
for
opening
the
second
cryptex
could
be
found
by
visiting
this
knight's
tomb,
somewhere
in
the
city.
Langdon
turned
excitedly
to
Teabing.
"Do
you
have
any
idea
what
knight
this
poem
is
referring
t0?
Teabing
grinned.
"Not
the
foggiest.
But
I
know
in
precisely
which
crypt
we
should
look."
At
that
moment,
fifteen
miles
ahead
of
them,
six
Kent
police
cars
streaked
