second
gate
opened,
and
the
exit
beckoned.
Except
for
the
police
car
blocking
the
top
of
the
ramp.
Vernet
dabbed
his
brow
and
pulled
forward.
A
lanky
officer
stepped
out
and
waved
him
to
a
stop
a
few
meters
from
the
roadblock.
Four
patrol
cars
were
parked
out
front.
Vernet
stopped.
Pulling
his
driver's
cap
down
farther,
he
effected
as
rough
a
facade
as
his
cultured
upbringing
would
allow.
Not
budging
from
behind
the
wheel,
he
opened
the
door
and
gazed
down
at
the
agent,
whose
face
was
stern
and
sallow.
"Qu'est
ce
qui
se

Vernet
asked,
his
tone
rough.
"Je
suis
Jerome
Collet,

the
agent
said.
"Lieutenant
Police
Judiciaire.
"
He
motioned
to
the
truck's
cargo
hold.
"Qu'est

"Hell

I
know,"
Vernet
replied
in
crude
French.
"I'm
only
a
driver."
Collet
looked
unimpressed.
"We're
looking
for
two
criminals."
Vernet
laughed.
"Then
you
came
to
the
right
spot.
Some
of
these
bastards
I
drive
for
have
so
much
money
they
must
be
criminals."
The
agent
held
up
a
passport
picture
of
Robert
Langdon.
"Was
this
man
in
your
bank
tonight?"
Vernet
shrugged.
"No
clue.
I'm
a
dock
rat.
They
don't
let
