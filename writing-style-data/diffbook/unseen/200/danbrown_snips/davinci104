mind
was
at
this
point
up
for
grabs,
but
at
least
Langdon
now
understood
why
she
was
trying
to
help
him.
P.S.
Find
Robert
Langdon.
She
apparently
believed
the
curator
had
left
her
a
cryptic
postscript
telling
her
to
find
Langdon.
"But
why
do
you
think
his
message
was
for
you?"
"The
Vitruvian
Man,
"
she
said
flatly.
"That
particular
sketch
has
always
been
my
favorite
Da

work.
Tonight
he
used
it
to
catch
my
attention."
"Hold
on.
You're
saying
the
curator
knew

favorite
piece
of
art?"
She
nodded.
"I'm
sorry.
This

Langdon

Langdon
studied
the
beautiful
young
woman
before
him,
well
aware
that
aging
men
in
France
often
took
young
mistresses.
Even
so,
Sophie
Neveu
as
a
"kept
woman"
somehow
didn't
seem
to
fit.
"We
had
a
falling
out
ten
years
ago,"
Sophie
said,
her
voice
a
whisper
now.
"We've
barely
spoken
since.
Tonight,
when
Crypto
got
the
call
that
he
had
been
murdered,
and
I
saw
the
images
