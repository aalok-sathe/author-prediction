original
British
Parliament
convened
in
the
days
before
the
modern
Parliament
building
existed.
It
had
been
years
since
he
had
been
there,
but
he
remembered
it
being
out
through
the
cloister
somewhere.
Taking
several
steps
back
from
the
tomb,
Langdon
peered
around
the
choir
screen
to
his
right,
across
the
nave
to
the
side
opposite
that
which
they
had
descended.
A
gaping
vaulted
passageway
stood
nearby,
with
a
large
sign.

Langdon
and
Sophie
were
jogging
as
they
passed
beneath
the
sign,
moving
too
quickly
to
notice
the
small
announcement
apologizing
that
certain
areas
were
closed
for
renovations.
They
emerged
immediately
into
a
high
walled,
open
roof
courtyard
through
which
morning
rain
was
falling.
Above
them,
the
wind
howled
across
the
opening
with
a
low
drone,
like
someone
blowing
over
the
mouth
of
a
bottle.
Entering
the
narrow,
low
hanging
walkways
that
bordered
the
courtyard
perimeter,
Langdon
felt
the
familiar
uneasiness
he
always
felt
in
enclosed
spaces.
These
walkways
were
called
cloisters,
and
Langdon
noted
with
uneasiness
that
these
particular
cloisters
lived
up
to
their
Latin
ties
to
the
word
claustrophobic.
