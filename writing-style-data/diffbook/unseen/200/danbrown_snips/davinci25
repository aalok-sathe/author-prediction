but
he
never
showed
up."
Fache
scribbled
some
notes
in
a
little
book.
As
they
walked,
Langdon
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
Louvre's
lesser
known
pyramid
La
Pyramide
Inversee
a
huge
inverted
skylight
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
like
a
stalactite
in
an
adjoining
section
of
the
entresol.
Fache
guided
Langdon
up
a
short
set
of
stairs
to
the
mouth
of
an
arched
tunnel,
over
which
a
sign
read:
DENON.
The
Denon
Wing
was
the
most
famous
of
the
Louvre's
three
main
sections.
"Who
requested
tonight's
meeting?"
Fache
asked
suddenly.
"You
or
he?"
The

I
would
be

in
Paris
this
month
and
wanted
to
discuss
something
with
me
while
I
was
here."
"Discuss
what?"
"I
don't
know.
Art,
I
imagine.
We
share
similar
interests."
Fache
looked
skeptical.
"You
have
no
idea
what
your
meeting
was
about?"
Langdon
did
not.
He'd
been
curious
at
the
time
but
had
not
felt
comfortable
demanding
specifics.
The
venerated
Jacques
Sauniere
had
a
renowned
penchant
for
privacy
and
granted
very
few
meetings;
Langdon
