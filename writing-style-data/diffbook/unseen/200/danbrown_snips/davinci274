as
long
as
you
care
to
use
it."
"You
say
keys
are
sometimes
inherited?"
Sophie
asked.
"Indeed.
Your
key
is
like
a
Swiss
numbered
account,
which
are
often
willed
through
generations.
On
our
gold
accounts,
the
shortest
safety
deposit
box
lease
is
fifty
years.
Paid
in
advance.
So

Langdon
stared.
"Did
you
say
fifty
years?"
"At
a
minimum,"
their
host
replied.
"Of

you
can
purchase

all
the
time

in
here
to
review
and
modify
the
contents
of
your
safe
deposit
box,
which
arrives
over
here."
He
walked
them
to
the
far
wall
where
a
wide
conveyor
belt
entered
the
room
in
a
graceful
curve,
vaguely
resembling
a
baggage
claim
carousel.
"You
insert
your
key
in
that

The
man
pointed
to
a
