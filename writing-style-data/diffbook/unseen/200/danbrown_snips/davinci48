blood.
Sauniere's
left
index
finger
was
also
bloody,
apparently
having
been
dipped
into
the
wound
to
create
the
most
unsettling
aspect
of
his
own
macabre
deathbed;
using
his
own
blood
as
ink,
and
employing
his
own
naked
abdomen
as
a
canvas,
Sauniere
had
drawn
a
simple
symbol
on
his
flesh
five
straight
lines
that
intersected
to
form
a
five
pointed
star.
The
pentacle.
The
bloody
star,
centered
on
Sauniere's
navel,
gave
his
corpse
a
distinctly
ghoulish
aura.
The
photo
Langdon
had
seen
was
chilling
enough,
but
now,
witnessing
the
scene
in
person,
Langdon
felt
a
deepening
uneasiness.
He
did
this
to
himself.
"Mr.
Langdon?"
Fache's
dark
eyes
settled
on
him
again.
"It's
a
pentacle,"
Langdon
offered,
his
voice
feeling
hollow
in
the
huge
space.
"One
of
the
oldest
symbols
on
earth.
Used
over
four
thousand
years
before
Christ."
"And
what
does
it
mean?"
Langdon
always
hesitated
when
he
got
this
question.
Telling
someone
what
a
symbol
"meant"
was
like
telling
them
how
a
song
should
make
them
feel
it
was
different
for
all
people.
