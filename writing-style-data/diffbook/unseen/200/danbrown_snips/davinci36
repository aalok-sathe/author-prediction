the
rise.
Tonight
the
battle
will
be
won,
he
thought,
amazed
that
only
months
ago
he
had
felt
powerless
against
the
hands
that
threatened
to
destroy
his
empire.
As
president
general
of
Opus
Dei,
Bishop
Aringarosa
had
spent
the
last
decade
of
his
life
spreading
the
message
of
"God's
Work"
literally,
Opus
Dei.
The
congregation,
founded
in
1928
by
the
Spanish
priest
Josemaria
Escriva,
promoted
a
return
to
conservative
Catholic
values
and
encouraged
its
members
to
make
sweeping
sacrifices
in
their
own
lives
in
order
to
do
the
Work
of
God.
Opus
Dei's
traditionalist
philosophy
initially
had
taken
root
in
Spain
before
Franco's
regime,
but
with
the
1934
publication
of
Josemaria
Escriva's
spiritual
book
The
Way
999
points
of
meditation
for
doing
God's
Work
in
one's
own
life
Escriva's
message
exploded
across
the
world.
Now,
with
over
four
million
copies
of
The
Way
in
circulation
in
forty
two
languages,
Opus
Dei
was
a
global
force.
Its
residence
halls,
teaching
centers,
and
even
universities
could
be
found
in
almost
every
major
metropolis
on
earth.
Opus
Dei
was
the
fastest
growing
and
most
financially
secure
Catholic
organization
in
the
world.
Unfortunately,
Aringarosa
had
learned,
in
an
age
of
religious
cynicism,
cults,
and
