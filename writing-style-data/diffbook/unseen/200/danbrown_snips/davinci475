Jewish
students
always
looked
flabbergasted
when
he
first
told
them
that
the
early
Jewish
tradition
involved
ritualistic
sex.
In
the
Temple,
no
less.
Early
Jews
believed
that
the
Holy
of
Holies
in
Solomon's
Temple
housed
not
only
God
but
also
His
powerful
female
equal,
Shekinah.
Men
seeking
spiritual
wholeness
came
to
the
Temple
to
visit
priestesses
or
hierodules
with
whom
they
made
love
and
experienced
the
divine
through
physical
union.
The
Jewish
tetragrammaton
YHWH
the
sacred
name
of
God
in
fact
derived
from
Jehovah,
an
androgynous
physical
union
between
the
masculine
Jah
and
the
pre
Hebraic
name
for
Eve,
Havah.
"For
the
early
Church,"
Langdon
explained
in
a
soft
voice,
"mankind's
use
of
sex
to
commune
directly
with
God
posed
a
serious
threat
to
the
Catholic
power
base.
It
left
the
Church
out
of
the
loop,
undermining
their
selfproclaimed
status
as
the
sole
conduit
to
God.
For
obvious
reasons,
they
worked
hard
to
demonize
sex
and
recast
it
as
a
disgusting
and
sinful
act.
Other
major
religions
did
the
same."
Sophie
was
silent,
but
Langdon
sensed
she
was
starting
to
understand
her
grandfather
better.
Ironically,
Langdon
had
made
this
same
point
in
a
class
lecture
earlier
this
semester.
