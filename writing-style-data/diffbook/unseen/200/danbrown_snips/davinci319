idling
truck.
"Set
the
box
down."
Sophie
clutched
the
box
to
her
chest.
"You
said
you
and
my
grandfather
were
friends."
"I
have
a
duty
to
protect
your
grandfather's
assets,"
Vernet
replied.
"And
that
is
exactly
what
I
am
doing.
Now
set
the
box
on
the

"My
grandfather
entrusted
this

set

"We
are
your
clients
now,"
Sophie
said.
Vernet's
visage
turned
ice
cold,
an
eerie
transformation.
"Mademoiselle
Neveu,
I
don't
know
how
you
got
that
key
and
account
number
tonight,
but
it
seems
obvious
that
foul
play
was
involved.
Had
I
known
the
extent
of
your
crimes,

would
never

"I
