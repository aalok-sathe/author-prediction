back
the
hearts
of
those
who
felt
the
demands
of
true
Catholicism
had
become
too
inconvenient
in
a
modern
world.
Aringarosa
had
been
using
all
of
his
political
sway
substantial
considering
the
size
of
the
Opus
Dei
constituency
and
their
bankroll
to
persuade
the
Pope
and
his
advisers
that
softening
the
Church's
laws
was
not
only
faithless
and
cowardly,
but
political
suicide.
He
reminded
them
that
previous
tempering
of
Church
law
the
Vatican
II
fiasco
had
left
a
devastating
legacy:
Church
attendance
was
now
lower
than
ever,
donations
were
drying
up,
and
there
were
not
even
enough
Catholic
priests
to
preside
over
their
churches.
People
need
structure
and
direction
from
the
Church,
Aringarosa
insisted,
not
coddling
and
indulgence!
On
that
night,
months
ago,
as
the
Fiat
had
left
the
airport,
Aringarosa
was
surprised
to
find
himself
heading
not
toward
Vatican
City
but
rather
eastward
up
a
sinuous
mountain
road.
"Where
are
we
going?"
he
had
demanded
of
his
driver.
"Alban
Hills,"
the
man
replied.
"Your
meeting
is
at
Castel
Gandolfo."
The
Pope
's
summer
residence
?
Aringarosa
had
never
been,
nor
had
he
ever
desired
to
see
it.
