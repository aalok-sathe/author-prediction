Miss
Neveu
assisted
in
your
escape
from
the
Louvre,
and
we
have
a
man
tied
up
in
the
back
of
the
plane.
Really
now!
We're
all
in
this
together."
"Maybe
a
different
airport?"
Sophie
said.
Teabing
shook
his
head.
"If
we
pull
up
now,
by
the
time
we
get
clearance
anywhere
else,
our
welcoming
party
will
include
army
tanks."

slumped.

were
to
have
any
chance
of

persuade
his
pilot
to
perform
one
highly
irregular
maneuver.

Hawker

Simon
Edwards
Executive
Services
Officer
at
Biggin
Hill
Airport
paced
the
control
tower,
squinting
nervously
at
the
rain
drenched
runway.
He
never
appreciated
being
awoken
early
on
a
Saturday
morning,
but
it
was
particularly
distasteful
that
he
had
been
called
in
to
oversee
the
arrest
of
one
of
his
most
lucrative
clients.
