Remy
said.
"I
will
assist
Silas
from
the
shadows."
"For
your
own
knowledge,
Remy,"
the
Teacher
had
told
him,
"the
tomb
in
question
is
not
in
the
Temple
Church.
So
have
no
fear.
They
are
looking
in
the
wrong
place."
Remy
was
stunned.
"And
you
know
where
the
tomb
is?"
"Of
course.
Later,
I
will

For

If
the
others
figure
out
the
true
location
of
the
tomb
and

Remy
didn't

One

of

Plenty
to
disappear
forever.
Remy
had
pictured
the
beach
towns
on
the
Cote
d'Azur,
where
he
planned
to
live
out
his
days
basking
in
the
sun
and
letting
others
serve
him
for
a
change.
Now,
however,
here
in
the
Temple
Church,
with
Langdon
threatening
to
break
the
keystone,
Remy's
future
was
at
risk.
Unable
to
bear
the
thought
of
coming
this
close
only
to
lose
it
all,
Remy
made
