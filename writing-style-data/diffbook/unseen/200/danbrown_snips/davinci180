told
him
it
would
be
lost
on
this
crowd.
"Hey,
Mr.
Langford,"
a
muscle
bound
man
said.
"Is
it
true
that
the
Mona
Lisa
is
a
picture
of
Da
Vinci
in
drag?
I
heard
that
was
true."
"It's
quite
possible,"
Langdon
said.
"Da
Vinci
was
a
prankster,
and
computerized
analysis
of
the
Mona
Lisa
and
Da
Vinci's
self
portraits
confirm
some
startling
points
of
congruency
in
their
faces.
Whatever
Da
Vinci
was
up
to,"
Langdon
said,
"his
Mona
Lisa
is
neither
male
nor
female.
It
carries
a
subtle
message
of
androgyny.
It
is
a
fusing
of
both."
"You
sure
that's
not
just
some
Harvard
bullshit
way
of
saying
Mona
Lisa
is
one
ugly
chick."
Now
Langdon
laughed.
"You
may
be
right.
But
actually
Da
Vinci
left
a
big
clue
that
the
painting
was
supposed
to
be
androgynous.
Has
anyone
here
ever
heard
of
an
Egyptian
god
named
Anion?"
"Hell
yes!"
the
big
guy
said.
"God
of
masculine
fertility!"
Langdon
was
stunned.
"It
says
so
on
every
box
of
Amon
condoms."
The
muscular
man
gave
a
wide
grin.
"It's
got
a
guy
with
a
ram's
head
on
the
front
and
says
he's
the
Egyptian
god
of
fertility."
Langdon
was
not
familiar
