a
map
of
stone
a
clef
de
voiite
or
keystone
an
engraved
tablet
that
revealed
the
final
resting
place
of
the
brotherhood's
greatest
secret
information
so
powerful
that
its
protection
was
the
reason
for
the
brotherhood's
very
existence.
"When
we
possess
the
keystone,"
the
Teacher
said,
"we
will
be
only
one
step
away."
"We
are
closer
than
you
think.
The
keystone
is
here
in
Paris."
"Paris?
Incredible.
It
is
almost
too
easy."
Silas
relayed
the
earlier
events
of
the
evening
how
all
four
of
his
victims,
moments
before
death,
had
desperately
tried
to
buy
back
their
godless
lives
by
telling
their
secret.
Each
had
told
Silas
the
exact
same
thing
that
the
keystone
was
ingeniously
hidden
at
a
precise
location
inside
one
of
Paris's
ancient
churches
the
Eglise
de
SaintSulpice.
"Inside
a
house
of
the
Lord,"
the
Teacher
exclaimed.
"How
they
mock
us!"
"As
they
have
for
centuries."
The
Teacher
fell
silent,
as
if
letting
the
triumph
of
this
moment
settle
over
him.
Finally,
he
spoke.
"You
have
done
a
great
service
to
God.
We
have
waited
centuries
for
this.
You
must
retrieve
the
stone
for
me.
Immediately.
Tonight.
You
understand
the
stakes."
Silas
knew
the
stakes
were
incalculable,
and
