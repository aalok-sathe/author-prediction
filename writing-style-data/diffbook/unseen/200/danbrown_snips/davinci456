Collet
barely
looked
up
from
the
burning
embers.
"He's
on
the
phone."
"I'm
off
the
phone,"
Fache
snapped,
stalking
into
the
room.
"What
have
you
got?"
The
second
agent
said,
"Sir,
Central
just
heard
from
Andre
Vernet
at
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich.
He
wants
to
talk
to
you
privately.
He
is
changing
his
story."
"Oh?"
Fache
said.
Now
Collet
looked
up.
"Vernet
is
admitting
that
Langdon
and
Neveu
spent
time
inside
his
bank
tonight."
"We
figured
that
out,"
Fache
said.
"Why
did
Vernet
lie
about
it?"
"He
said
he'll
talk
only
to
you,
but
he's
agreed
to
cooperate
fully."
"In
exchange
for
what?"
"For
our
keeping
his
bank's
name
out
of
the
news
and
also
for
helping
him
recover
some
stolen
property.
It
sounds
like
Langdon
and
Neveu
stole
something
from
Sauniere's
account."
"What?"
Collet
blurted.
"How?"
Fache
never
flinched,
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
second
agent.
"What
did
they
steal?"
"Vernet
didn't
elaborate,
but
he
sounds
like
he's
willing
to
do
anything
to
get
it
back."
Collet
tried
to
imagine
how
this
could
happen.
Maybe
Langdon
and
Neveu
had
held
a
bank
employee
at
gunpoint?
Maybe
they
forced
Vernet
to
open
Sauniere's
account
and
facilitate
an
escape
in
