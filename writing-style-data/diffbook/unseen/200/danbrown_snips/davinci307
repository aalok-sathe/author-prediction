could
open
it
up
and
find
my
birthday
card."
"A
lot
of
work
for
a
card."
"No,
the
cards
always
contained
another
riddle
or
clue.
My
grandfather
loved
creating
elaborate
treasure
hunts
around
our
house,
a
string
of
clues
that
eventually
led
to
my
real
gift.
Each
treasure
hunt
was
a
test
of
character
and
merit,
to
ensure
I
earned
my
rewards.
And
the
tests
were
never
simple."
Langdon
eyed
the
device
again,
still
looking
skeptical.
"But
why
not

pry
it
apart?
Or
smash
it?
The
metal
looks
delicate,
and

is
a
soft
rock.
Sophie

"Because
Da

that
if
you
try
to
force
it
open
in

way,
the
information
self
destructs.
Watch."
Sophie
reached
into
the
box
and
carefully
lifted
out
the
cylinder.
"Any
information
to
be
inserted
is
first
written
on
a
papyrus
scroll."
"Not
vellum?"
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"Papyrus.
I
know
sheep's
vellum
was
more
durable
and
more
common
in
those
days,
but
it
had
to
be
papyrus.
The
thinner
the
better."
"Okay."
"Before
the
papyrus
was
inserted
into
the
cryptex's
compartment,
it
was
rolled
around
a
delicate
glass
vial."
