on
the
floor.
"A
Discipline
belt.
He
wore
it
on
his
thigh.
I
took
careful
aim."
Langdon
rubbed
his
head.
He
knew
of
Discipline
belts.
"But
how
did
you
know?"
Teabing
grinned.
"Christianity
is
my
field
of
study,
Robert,
and
there
are
certain
sects
who

hearts
on

sleeves."

were."

and
deeply
dedicated
members
of
the
community.
Not
surprisingly,
the
media
spotlighted
their
spiritual
commitment
only
briefly
before
moving
on
to
the
shock
value
of
the
sect's
more
stringent
"numerary"
members

like
the
monk
now
lying
on
the
floor
before
Langdon.
Teabing
was
looking
closely
at
the
bloody
belt.
"But
why

Opus
