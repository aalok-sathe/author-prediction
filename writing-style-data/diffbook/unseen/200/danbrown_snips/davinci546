grow
hot
and
realized
he
had
wet
himself.
"Listen
carefully,"
the
tuxedoed
man
whispered.
"You
will
exit
this
church
silently,
and
you
will
run.
You
will
not
stop.
Is
that
clear?"
The
boy
nodded
as
best
he
could
with
the
hand
over
his
mouth.
"If
you
call
the
police"
The
tuxedoed
man
pressed
the
gun
to
his
skin.
"I
will
find
you."
The

Silas
drifted

Sophie

their

astonished
and
fearful.
"What?"
Teabing
choked
out.
"What
did
you
do
to
Remy!"
"Your
only
concern,"
Silas
said
calmly,
"is
that
I
leave
here
with
the
keystone."
This
recovery
mission,
as
Remy
had
described
it,
was
to
be
clean
and
simple:
Enter
the
church,
take
the
keystone,
and
walk
out;
no
killing,
no
struggle.
Holding
Sophie
firm,
Silas
dropped
his
hand
