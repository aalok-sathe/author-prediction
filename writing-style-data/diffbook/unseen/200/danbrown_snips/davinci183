"She
told
him."
"What!
Why?"
"Damned
good
question,
but
I
just
heard
a
recording
that
confirms
she
tipped
him
off."
Collet
was
speechless.
What
was
Neveu
thinking?
Fache
had
proof
that
Sophie
had
interfered
with
a
DCPJ
sting
operation?
Sophie
Neveu
was
not
only
going
to
be
fired,
she
was
also
going
to
jail.
"But,
Captain
then
where
is
Langdon
now?"
"Have
any
fire
alarms
gone
off
there?"
"No,
sir."
"And
no
one
has
come
out
under
the
Grand
Gallery
gate?"
"No.
We've
got
a
Louvre
security
officer
on
the
gate.
Just
as
you
requested."
"Okay,
Langdon
must
still
be
inside
the
Grand
Gallery."
"Inside?
But
what
is
he
doing?"
"Is
the
Louvre
security
guard
armed?"
"Yes,
sir.
He's
a
senior
warden."
"Send
him
in,"
Fache
commanded.
"I
can't
get
my
men
back
to
the
perimeter
for
a
few
minutes,
and
I
don't
want
Langdon
breaking
for
an
exit."
Fache
paused.
"And
you'd
better
tell
the
guard
Agent
Neveu
is
probably
in
there
with
him."
"Agent
Neveu
left,
I
thought."
"Did
you
actually
see
her
leave?"
"No,
sir,
but"
"Well,
nobody
on
the
perimeter
saw
her
leave
either.
They
only
saw
her
go
in."
Collet
was
flabbergasted
by
Sophie
Neveu's
