searching
for
the
keystone.
How
they
knew
of
it,
Sister
Sandrine
could
not
imagine,
although
she
knew
she
did
not
have
time
to
think.
The
bloody
monk
was
now
quietly
donning
his
cloak
again,
clutching
his
prize
as
he
moved
toward
the
altar,
toward
the
Bible.
In
breathless
silence,
Sister
Sandrine
left
the
balcony
and
raced
down
the
hall
to
her
quarters.
Getting
on
her
hands
and
knees,
she
reached
beneath
her
wooden
bed
frame
and
retrieved
the
sealed
envelope
she
had
hidden
there
years
ago.
Tearing
it
open,
she
found
four
Paris
phone
numbers.
Trembling,
she
began
to
dial.
Downstairs,
Silas
laid
the
stone
tablet
on
the
altar
and
turned
his
eager
hands
to
the
leather
Bible.
His
long
white
fingers
were
sweating
now
as
he
turned
the
pages.
Flipping
through
the
Old
Testament,
he
found
the
Book
of
Job.
He
located
chapter
thirty
eight.
As
he
ran
his
finger
down
the
column
of
text,
he
anticipated
the
words
he
was
about
to
read.
They
will
lead
the
way!
Finding
verse
number
eleven,
Silas
read
the
text.
It
was
only
seven
words.
Confused,
he
read
it
again,
sensing
something
had
gone
terribly
wrong.
The
verse
simply
read:
HITHERTO
SHALT
