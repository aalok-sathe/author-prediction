this
key
could
have
anything
to
do
with
the
Grail."
"Because
the
Grail
is
supposed
to
be
in
England?"
"Not
only
that.
The
location
of
the
Holy
Grail
is
one
of
the
best
kept
secrets
in
history.
Priory
members
wait
decades
proving
themselves
trustworthy
before
being
elevated
to
the
highest
echelons
of
the
fraternity
and
learning
where
the
Grail
is.
That
secret
is
protected
by
an
intricate
system
of
compartmentalized
knowledge,
and
although
the
Priory
brotherhood
is
very
large,
only
four
members
at
any
given
time
know
where
the
Grail
is
hidden

Grand
Master
and
his
three
senechaux.
The
probability
of
your
grandfather
being
one
of
those
four
top
people
is
very
slim."
My
grandfather
was
one
of
them,
Sophie
thought,
pressing
down
on
the
accelerator.
She
had
an
image
stamped
in
her
memory
that
confirmed
her
grandfather's
status
within
the
brotherhood
beyond
any
doubt.
"And
even
if
your
grandfather
were
in
the
upper
echelon,
he
would
never
be
allowed
to
reveal
anything
to
anyone
outside
the
brotherhood.
It
is
inconceivable
that
he
would
bring
you
into
the
inner
circle."
I've
already
been
there,
Sophie
thought,
picturing
the
ritual
in
the
basement.
She
wondered
if
this
were
the
moment
