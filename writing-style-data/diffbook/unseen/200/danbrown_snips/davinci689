luxury.
They're
giving
me
a
room
at
the
Brunelleschi.
Sophie
smiled
playfully.
"You
presume
a
lot,
Mr.
Langdon."
He
cringed
at
how
it
had
sounded.
"What
I
meant
"I
would
love
nothing
more
than
to
meet
you
in
Florence,
Robert.
But

no
churches,
no

no

promise.
"Right,"
Langdon
managed.
"It's
a
date."

the
blinds.
Is
it
dusk
or
dawn
?
he
wondered.
Langdon's
body
felt
warm
and
deeply
contented.
He
had
slept
the
better
part
of
the
last
two
days.
Sitting
up
slowly
in
bed,
he
now
realized
what
had
awoken
him
the
strangest
thought.
For
days
he
had
been
trying
to
sort
through
a

of
information,
but
