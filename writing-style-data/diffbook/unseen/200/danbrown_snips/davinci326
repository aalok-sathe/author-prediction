his
phone
might
not
have
been
working
properly,
he
feared
what
the
Teacher
might
think
if
he
had
been
repeatedly
phoning
with
no
answer.
He
'11
think
something
is
wrong.
Or
that
I
failed
to
get
the
bonds.
The
bishop
broke
a
light
sweat.
Or
worse
that
I
took
the
money
and
ran!
Even
at
a
modest
sixty
kilometers
an
hour,
the
dangling
front
bumper
of
the
armored
truck
grated
against
the
deserted
suburban
road
with
a
grinding
roar,
spraying
sparks

We've
got
to

could
barely
even

truck's
lone
working
headlight
had
been
knocked
off
center
and
was
casting
a
skewed
sidelong
beam
into
the
woods
beside
the
country
highway.
Apparently

armor
in
this
"armored
truck"
referred
only
to
the
cargo
hold
and
not
the
front
end.
Sophie
sat
in
the
passenger
seat,
staring
blankly
at
the
rosewood
box
on
her
lap.
"Are
you
okay?"
Langdon
asked.
Sophie
looked
shaken.
"Do
you
believe
him?"
"About
the
three
additional
murders?
Absolutely.
It
answers
a
lot
of
questions
the
issue
of
your
grandfather's
desperation
to
pass
on
the
keystone,
as
well
as
the
intensity
