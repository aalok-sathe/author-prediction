Wind
Rose,
it
denoted
the
directions
of
the
thirty
two
winds,
blowing
from
the
directions
of
eight
major
winds,
eight
half
winds,
and
sixteen
quarter
winds.
When
diagrammed
inside
a
circle,
these
thirty
two
points
of
the
compass
perfectly
resembled
a
traditional
thirty
two
petal
rose
bloom.
To
this
day,
the
fundamental
navigational
tool
was
still
known
as
a
Compass
Rose,
its
northernmost
direction
still
marked
by
an
arrowhead
or,
more
commonly,
the
symbol
of
the
fleur
de
lis.
On
a
globe,
a
Rose
Line
also
called
a
meridian
or
longitude
was
any
imaginary
line
drawn
from
the
North
Pole
to
the
South
Pole.
There
were,
of
course,
an
infinite
number
of
Rose
Lines
because
every
point
on
the
globe
could
have
a
longitude
drawn
through
it
connecting
north
and
south
poles.
The
question
for
early
navigators
was
which
of
these
lines
would
be
called
the
Rose
Line
the
zero
longitude
the
line
from
which
all
other
longitudes
on
earth
would
be
measured.
Today
that
line
was
in
Greenwich,
England.
But
it
had
not
always
been.
Long
before
the
establishment
of
Greenwich
as
the
prime
meridian,
the
zero
longitude
of
the
entire
world
had
passed
directly
through
Paris,
and
through
