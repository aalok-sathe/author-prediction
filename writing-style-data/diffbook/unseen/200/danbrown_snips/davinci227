citadel
housed
the
Specula
Vaticana
the
Vatican
Observatory
one
of
the
most
advanced
astronomical
observatories
in
Europe.
Aringarosa
had
never
been
comfortable
with
the
Vatican's
historical
need
to
dabble
in
science.
What
was
the
rationale
for
fusing
science
and
faith?
Unbiased
science
could
not
possibly
be
performed
by
a
man
who
possessed
faith
in
God.
Nor
did
faith
have
any
need
for
physical
confirmation
of
its
beliefs.
Nonetheless,
there
it
is,
he
thought
as
Castel
Gandolfo
came
into
view,
rising
against
a
star
filled
November
sky.
From
the
access
road,
Gandolfo
resembled
a
great
stone
monster
pondering
a
suicidal
leap.
Perched
at
the
very
edge
of
a
cliff,
the
castle
leaned
out
over
the
cradle
of
Italian
civilization
the
valley
where
the
Curiazi
and
Orazi
clans
fought
long
before
the
founding
of
Rome.
Even
in
silhouette,
Gandolfo
was
a
sight
to
behold
an
impressive
example
of
tiered,
defensive
architecture,
echoing
the
potency
of
this
dramatic
cliffside
setting.
Sadly,
Aringarosa
now
saw,
the
Vatican
had
ruined
the
building
by
constructing
two
huge
aluminum
telescope
domes
atop
the
roof,
leaving
this
once
dignified
edifice
looking
like
a
proud
warrior
wearing
a
couple
of
party
hats.
When
Aringarosa
got
out
of
the
car,
