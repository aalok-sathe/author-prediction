but
a
"per
landing
fee"
for
his
frequent
arrivals
and
departures.
Usually,
the
airfield
had
advance
warning
of
his
schedule
and
was
able
to
follow
a
strict
protocol
for
his
arrival.
Teabing
liked
things
just
so.
The
custom
built
Jaguar
stretch
limousine
that
he
kept
in

here
at
Biggin
Hill,
and
the
employees
reaped
the
benefits.
Edwards's
nerves
felt
frayed
now
as
he
watched
the
jet
coming
in.
He
wondered
if
Teabing's
penchant
for
spreading
the
wealth
had
gotten
him
in
trouble
somehow;
the
French
authorities
seemed
very
intent
on
containing
him.
Edwards
had

told

the
charges
