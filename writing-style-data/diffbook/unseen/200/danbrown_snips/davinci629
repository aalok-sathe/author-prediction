carry
out
the
final
phase
of
his
mission.
Westminster
Abbey
had
been
a
short
walk,
and
although
Teabing's
leg
braces,
crutches,
and
gun
had
set
off
the
metal
detector,
the
rent
a
cops
never
knew
what
to
do.
Do
we
ask
him
to
remove
his
braces
and
crawl
through?
Do
we
frisk
his
deformed
body?
Teabing
presented
the
flustered
guards
a
far
easier
solution
an
embossed
card
identifying
him
as
Knight
of
the
Realm.
The
poor
fellows
practically
tripped
over
one
another

him
in.
Now,
eyeing

bewildered
Langdon
and
Neveu,
Teabing

that
would
soon
bring
about
the
demise
of

in
flawless
French,
"vous
ne
trouvezpas
le
Saint
Graal,
c'est
le
Saint
Graal
qui
vous
trouve.
"
He
smiled.
"Our
paths
together
could
not
be
more
clear.
The
Grail
has
found
us."
Silence.
He
spoke
to
them
in
a
whisper
now.
"Listen.
Can
you
hear
it?
The
Grail
is
speaking
to
us
across
the
centuries.
She
is
begging
to
be
saved
from
the
Priory's
