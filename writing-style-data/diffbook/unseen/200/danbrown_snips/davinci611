to
her,
she
was
staring
aghast
at
the
top
of
the
black
marble
sarcophagus.
"Someone
was
here,"
she
whispered,
pointing
to
a
spot
on
the
sarcophagus
near
Newton's
outstretched
right
foot.
Langdon
did
not
understand
her
concern.
A
careless
tourist
had
left
a
charcoal,
grave
rubbing
pencil
on
the
sarcophagus
lid
near
Newton's
foot.
It's
nothing.
Langdon
reached
out
to
pick
it
up,
but
as

the

shifted
on

and

Scrawled

trepidation
that
settled
over
him
upon
seeing
the
words,
Langdon
told
himself
this
was
good
news.
Leigh
is
still
alive.
There
was
another
implication
here
too.
"They
don't
know
the
password
either,"
he
whispered.
Sophie
nodded.
Otherwise
why
make
their
presence
known?
"They
may
want
to
trade
Leigh
for
the
password."
"Or

Langdon
shook
