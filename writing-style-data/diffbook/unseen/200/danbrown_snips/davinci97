"I
wanted
to
warn
you,
Mr.
Langdon"
Sophie
began,
still
catching
her
breath,
"that
you
are
sous
surveillance
cachee.
Under
a
guarded
observation."
As
she
spoke,
her
accented
English
resonated
off
the
tile
walls,
giving
her
voice
a
hollow
quality.
"But
why?"
Langdon
demanded.
Sophie
had
already
given
him
an
explanation
on
the
phone,
but
he
wanted
to
hear
it
from
her
lips.
"Because,"
she
said,
stepping
toward
him,
"Fache's
primary
suspect
in
this
murder
is
you.
Langdon
was
braced
for
the
words,
and
yet
they
still
sounded
utterly
ridiculous.
According
to
Sophie,
Langdon
had
been
called
to
the
Louvre
tonight
not
as
a
symbologist
but
rather
as
a
suspect
and
was
currently
the
unwitting
target
of
one
of
DCPJ's
favorite
interrogation
methods
surveillance
cachee
a
deft
deception
in
which
the
police
calmly
invited
a
suspect
to
a
crime
scene
and
interviewed
him
in
hopes
he
would
get
nervous
and
mistakenly
incriminate
himself.
"Look
in
your
jacket's
left
pocket,"
Sophie
said.
"You'll
find
proof
they
are
watching
you."
Langdon
felt
his
apprehension
rising.
Look
in
my
pocket?
It
sounded
like
some
kind
of
cheap
magic
trick.
"Just
look."
Bewildered,
Langdon
reached
his
hand
into
his
tweed
jacket's
left
pocket
