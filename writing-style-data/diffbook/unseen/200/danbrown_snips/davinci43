guessed,
was
worth
upward
of
two
million
dollars,
and
yet
it
was
lying
on
the
floor
like
a
discarded
poster.
"What
the
devil
is
it
doing
on
the
floor!"
Fache
glowered,
clearly
unmoved.
"This
is
a
crime
scene,
Mr.
Langdon.
We
have
touched
nothing.
That
canvas
was
pulled
from
the
wall
by
the
curator.
It
was
how
he
activated
the
security
system."
Langdon
looked
back
at
the
gate,
trying
to
picture
what
had
happened.
"The
curator
was
attacked
in
his
office,
fled
into
the
Grand
Gallery,
and
activated
the
security
gate
by
pulling
that
painting
from
the
wall.
The
gate
fell
immediately,
sealing
off
all
access.
This
is
the
only
door
in
or
out
of
this
gallery."
Langdon
felt
confused.
"So
the
curator
actually
captured
his
attacker
inside
the
Grand
Gallery?"
Fache
shook
his
head.
"The
security
gate
separated
Sauniere
from
his
attacker.
The
killer
was
locked
out
there
in
the
hallway
and
shot
Sauniere
through
this
gate."
Fache
pointed
toward
an
orange
tag
hanging
from
one
of
the
bars
on
the
gate
under
which
they
had
just
passed.
"The
PTS
team
found
flashback
residue
from
a
gun.
He
fired
through
the
bars.
Sauniere
died
in
here
alone."
