to
know
if
you
sent
any
copies
out
for
blurbs
without
telling
me?"
Faukman
hesitated.
Langdon's
newest
manuscript
an
exploration
of
the
history
of
goddess
worship
included
several
sections
about
Mary
Magdalene
that
were
going
to
raise

not
happy
about
it.
"The
manuscript
was
clean,
Robert,
and
I
wanted
to
surprise
you
with
some
terrific
blurbs."
A
pause.
"Did
you
send
one
to
the
curator
of
the
Paris
Louvre?"
"What
