The
barn's
rear
slider
was
wide
open,
giving
way
to
a
dark,
muddy
slope
of
rugged
fields
that
stretched
out
into
the
night
behind
the
barn.
Collet
ran
to
the
door,
trying
to
see
out
into
the
darkness.
All
he
could
make
out
was
the
faint
shadow
of
a
forest
in
the
distance.
No
headlights.
This
wooded
valley
was
probably
crisscrossed
by
dozens
of
unmapped
fire
roads
and
hunting
trails,
but
Collet
was
confident
his
quarry
would
never
make
the
woods.
"Get
some
men
spread

down
there.
They're
probably

"Urn,
sir?"
The

pointed

a
nearby
pegboard
on
which
hung
several
sets
of
keys.
The
labels
above
the
keys
bore
familiar
names.
DAIMLER
ROLLS
ROYCE

MARTIN
PORSCHE
The
last
peg
was
empty.
When
Collet
read
the
label
above
the
empty
peg,
he
knew
he
was
in
trouble.
The
Range
Rover
was
Java
Black
Pearl,
four
wheel
drive,
standard
transmission,
with
high
strength
polypropylene
lamps,
rear
light
cluster
fittings,
and
the
steering
wheel
on
the
right.
Langdon
was
pleased
he
was
not
driving.
Teabing's
manservant
Remy,
on
orders
from
his
master,
was
doing
an
impressive
job
