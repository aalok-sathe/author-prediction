In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
His
labor's
fruit
a
Holy
wrath
incurred.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
When
Sophie
arrived
at
the
second
group
of
knights,
she
found
that
this
second
group
was
similar
to
the
first.
All
lay
with
varied
body
positions,
wearing
armor
and
swords.
That
was,
all
except
the
tenth
and
final
tomb.
Hurrying
over
to
it,
she
stared
down.
No
pillow.
No
armor.
No
tunic.
No
sword.
"Robert?
Leigh?"
she
called,
her
voice
echoing
around
the
chamber.
"There's
something
missing
over
here."
Both
men
looked
up
and
immediately
began
to
cross
the
room
toward
her.
"An
orb?"
Teabing
called
excitedly.
His
crutches
clicked
out
a
rapid
staccato
as
he
hurried
across
the
room.
"Are
we
missing
an
orb?"
"Not
exactly,"
Sophie
said,
frowning
at
the
tenth
tomb.
"We
seem
to
be
missing
an
entire
knight."
Arriving
beside
her
both
men
gazed
down
in
confusion
at
the
tenth
tomb.
Rather
than
a
knight
lying
in
the
open
air,
this
tomb
was
a
sealed
stone
casket.
The
casket
was
trapezoidal,
tapered
at
the
feet,
widening
toward
the
top,
with
a
peaked
lid.
