since
they
entered
the
building.
He
turned
to
the
docent.
"Do
you
know
what
that
house
is?"
He
nodded,
also
looking
puzzled
that
Sophie
was
going
down
there.
"That's
the
chapel
rectory.
The
chapel
curator
lives
there.
She

Rosslyn

box
in

hand.
Impossible.
Slowly,
Langdon
turned
back
to
the
young
man.
"You
said
your
grandmother
has
a
box
like
this

"Almost

"Where

get

"My
grandfather
made
it
