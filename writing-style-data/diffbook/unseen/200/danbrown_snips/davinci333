Bezu
Fache
always
uses
the
media
to
his
advantage.
He'll
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
move
around
without
being
recognized."
Terrific,
Langdon
thought.
My
French
TV
debut
will
be
on
"Paris
's
Most
Wanted.
"
At
least
Jonas
Faukman
would
be
pleased;
every
time
Langdon
made
the
news,
his
book
sales
jumped.
"Is
this
man
a
good
enough
friend?"
Sophie
asked.
Langdon
doubted
Teabing
was
someone
who
watched
television,
especially
at

still
the

deserved
consideration.

he
would
salivate

"Teabing
could
be
a
powerful
ally,"
Langdon
said.
Depending
on
how

"Fache
probably
will
be
offering
a
monetary
reward."
Langdon
laughed.
"Believe
me,
money
is
the
last
thing
this
guy
needs."
