several
times
onboard
the
jet,
he
had
been
unable
to
extract
any
specific
location.
Now,
as
he
read
the
words
again,
he
processed
them
slowly
and
carefully,
hoping
the
pentametric
rhythms
would
reveal
a
clearer
meaning
now
that
he
was
on
the
ground.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
His
labor's
fruit
a
Holy
wrath
incurred.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
The
language
seemed
simple
enough.
There
was
a
knight
buried
in
London.
A
knight
who
labored
at
something
that
angered
the
Church.
A
knight
whose
tomb
was
missing
an
orb
that
should
be
present.
The
poem's
final
reference
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb
was
a
clear
allusion
to
Mary
Magdalene,
the
Rose
who
bore
the
seed
of
Jesus.
Despite
the
apparent
straightforwardness
of
the
verse,
Langdon
still
had
no
idea
who
this
knight
was
or
where
he
was
buried.
Moreover,
once
they
located
the
tomb,
it
sounded
as
if
they
would
be
searching
for
something
that
was
absent.
The
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb
?
"No
thoughts?"
Teabing
clucked
in
disappointment,
although
Langdon
sensed
the
Royal
Historian
was
enjoying
being
one
up.
