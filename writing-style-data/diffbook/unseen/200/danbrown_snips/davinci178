fact,
one
of
the
world's
most
documented
inside
jokes.
The
painting's
well
documented
collage
of
double
entendres
and
playful
allusions
had
been
revealed
in
most
art
history
tomes,
and
yet,
incredibly,
the
public
at
large
still
considered
her
smile
a
great
mystery.
No
mystery
at
all,
Langdon
thought,
moving
forward
and
watching
as
the
faint
outline
of
the
painting
began
to
take
shape.
No
mystery
at
all.
Most
recently
Langdon
had
shared
the
Mona
Lisa
's
secret
with
a
rather
unlikely
group
a
dozen
inmates
at
the
Essex
County
Penitentiary.
Langdon's
jail
seminar
was
part
of
a
Harvard
outreach
program
attempting
to
bring
education
into
the
prison
system
Culture
for
Convicts,
as
Langdon's
colleagues
liked
to
call
it.
Standing
at
an
overhead
projector
in
a
darkened
penitentiary
library,
Langdon
had
shared
the
Mona
Lisa's
secret
with
the
prisoners
attending
class,
men
whom
he
found
surprisingly
engaged
rough,
but
sharp.
"You
may
notice,"
Langdon
told
them,
walking
up
to
the
projected
image
of
the
Mona
Lisa
on
the
library
wall,
"that
the
background
behind
her
face
is
uneven."
Langdon
motioned
to
the
glaring
discrepancy.
"Da
Vinci
painted
the
horizon
line
on
the
left
significantly
lower
than
the
right."
"He
