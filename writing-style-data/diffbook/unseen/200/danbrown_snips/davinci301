truck,
after
an
unnerving
pause
atop
the
bank
ramp,
had
moved
on,
snaking
left
and
right
for
a
minute
or
two,
and
was
now
accelerating
to
what
felt
like
top
speed.
Beneath
them,
the
bulletproof
tires
hummed
on
smooth
pavement.
Forcing
his
attention
to
the
rosewood
box
in
his
arms,
Langdon
laid
the
precious
bundle
on
the
floor,
unwrapped
his
jacket,
and
extracted
the

Sophie
shifted

position
so
they

societies.
The

The
Knights
of
the
Rosy
Cross.
"Go
ahead,"
Sophie
said.
"Open
it."
Langdon
took
a
deep
breath.
Reaching
for
the
lid,
he
stole
one
more
admiring
glance
at
the
intricate
woodwork
and
then,
unhooking
the
clasp,
he
opened
the
lid,
revealing
the
object
within.
Langdon
had
harbored

fantasies
about
