maneuvering
the
vehicle
across
the
moonlit
fields
behind
Chateau
Villette.
With
no
headlights,
he
had
crossed
an
open
knoll
and
was
now
descending
a
long
slope,
moving
farther
away
from
the
estate.
He
seemed
to
be
heading
toward
a
jagged
silhouette
of
wooded
land
in
the
distance.
Langdon,
cradling
the
keystone,
turned
in
the
passenger
seat
and
eyed
Teabing
and
Sophie
in
the
back
seat.
"How's
your
head,
Robert?"
Sophie
asked,
sounding
concerned.
Langdon
forced
a
pained
smile.
"Better,
thanks."
It
was
killing
him.
Beside
her,
Teabing
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
bound
and
gagged
monk
lying
in
the
cramped
luggage
area
behind
the
back
seat.
Teabing
had
the
monk's
gun
on
his
lap
and
looked
like
an
old
photo
of
a
British
safari
chap
posing
over
his
kill.
"So
glad
you
popped
in
this
evening,
Robert,"
Teabing
said,
grinning
as
if
he
were
having
fun
for
the
first
time
in
years.
"Sorry
to
get
you
involved
in
this,
Leigh."
"Oh,
please,
I've
waited
my
entire
life
to
be
involved."
Teabing
looked
past
Langdon
out
the
windshield
at
the
shadow
of
a
long
hedgerow.
He
tapped
Remy
on
the
shoulder
from
behind.
"Remember,
no
brake
lights.
Use
the
emergency
