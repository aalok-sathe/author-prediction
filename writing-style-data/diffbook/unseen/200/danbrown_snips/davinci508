tune
up."
The
policemen
all
exchanged
looks.
Edwards
winced.
"Very
good,
sir."
"Sir,"
the
Kent
chief
inspector
said,
stepping
forward.
"I
need
to
ask
you
to
stay
onboard
for
another
half
hour
or
so."
Teabing
looked
unamused
as
he
hobbled
down
the
stairs.
"I'm
afraid
that
is
impossible.
I
have
a
medical
appointment."
He
reached
the
tarmac.
"I
cannot
afford
to
miss
it."
The
chief
inspector
repositioned
himself
to
block
Teabing's
progress
away
from
the
plane.
"I
am
here
at
the
orders
of
the
French
Judicial
Police.
They
claim
you
are
transporting
fugitives
from
the
law
on
this
plane."
Teabing
stared
at
the
chief
inspector
a
long
moment,
and
then
burst
out
laughing.
"Is
this
one
of
those
hidden
camera
programs?
Jolly
good!"
The
chief
inspector
never
flinched.
"This
is
serious,
sir.
The
French
police
claim
you
also
may
have
a
hostage
onboard."
Teabing's
manservant
Remy
appeared
in
the
doorway
at
the
top
of
the
stairs.
"I
feel
like
a
hostage
working
for
Sir
Leigh,
but
he
assures
me
I
am
free
to
go."
Remy
checked
his
watch.
"Master,
we
really
are
running
late."
He
nodded
toward
the
Jaguar
stretch
limousine
in
the
far
corner
of
the
hangar.
The
enormous
