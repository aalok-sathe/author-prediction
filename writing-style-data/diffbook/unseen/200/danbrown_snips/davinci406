me,
I
have
been
researching
them
for
decades,
and
I
can't
even
name
one
Priory
member.
It
seems
inconceivable
that
all
three
senechaux
and
the
Grand
Master
could
be
discovered
and
killed
in
one
day.
"I
doubt
the
information
was
gathered
in
a
single
day,"
Sophie
said.
"It
sounds
like
a
well
planned
decapiter.
It's
a
technique
we
use
to
fight
organized
crime
syndicates.
If
DCPJ
wants
to
move
on
a
certain
group,
they
will
silently
listen
and
watch
for
months,
identify
all
the
main
players,
and
then
move
in
and
take
them
all
at
the
same
moment.
Decapitation.
With
no
leadership,
the
group
falls
into
chaos
and
divulges
other
information.
It's
possible
someone
patiently
watched
the
Priory
and
then
attacked,
hoping
the
top
people
would
reveal
the
location
of
the
keystone."
Teabing
looked
unconvinced.
"But
the
brothers
would
never
talk.
They
are
sworn
to
secrecy.
Even
in
the
face
of
death."
"Exactly,"
Langdon
said.
"Meaning,
if
they
never
divulged
the
secret,
and
they
were
killed"
Teabing
gasped.
"Then
the
location
of
the
keystone
would
be
lost
forever!"
"And
with
it,"
Langdon
said,
"the
location
of
the
Holy
Grail."
Teabing's
body
seemed
to
sway
with
the
weight
of
Langdon's
words.
