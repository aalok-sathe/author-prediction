sanctuary
in
New
York
City.
The
Lord
has
provided
me
shelter
and
purpose
in
my
life.
Tonight,
at
last,
Silas
felt
he
had
begun
to
repay
his
debt.
Hurrying
to
the
dresser,
he
found
the
cell
phone
hidden
in
his
bottom
drawer
and
placed
a
call.
"Yes?"

me
what
I
must
know."
Silas
knew
the
information
he
had
gleaned
from
his
victims
would
come
as
a
shock.
"Teacher,
all
four
confirmed
the
existence
of
the
clef
de
voiite
the
legendary
keystone.
He
heard
a
quick
intake
of
breath
over
the
phone
and
could
feel
the
Teacher's
excitement.

Exactly

According

brotherhood
