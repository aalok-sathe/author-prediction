around
you,
Cardinal.
People
have
lost
respect.
The
rigors
of
faith
are
gone.
The
doctrine
has
become
a
buffet
line.
Abstinence,
confession,
communion,
baptism,
mass
take
your
pick
choose
whatever
combination
pleases
you
and
ignore
the
rest.
What
kind
of
spiritual
guidance
is
the
Church
offering?"
"Third
century
laws,"
the
second
cardinal
said,
"cannot
be
applied
to
the
modern
followers
of
Christ.
The
rules
are
not
workable
in
today's
society."
"Well,
they
seem
to
be
working
for
Opus
Dei!"
"Bishop
Aringarosa,"
the
secretariat
said,
his
voice
conclusive.
"Out
of
respect
for
your
organization's
relationship
with
the
previous
Pope,
His
Holiness
will
be
giving
Opus
Dei
six
months
to
voluntarily
break
away
from
the
Vatican.
I
suggest
you
cite
your
differences
of
opinion
with
the
Holy
See
and
establish
yourself
as
your
own
Christian
organization."
"I
refuse!"
Aringarosa
declared.
"And
I'll
tell
him
that
in
person!"
"I'm
afraid
His
Holiness
no
longer
cares
to
meet
with
you."
Aringarosa
stood
up.
"He
would
not
dare
abolish
a
personal
prelature
established
by
a
previous
Pope!"
"I'm
sorry."
The
secretariat's
eyes
did
not
flinch.
"The
Lord
giveth
and
the
Lord
taketh
away."
Aringarosa
had
staggered
from
that
meeting
in
bewilderment
and
panic.
