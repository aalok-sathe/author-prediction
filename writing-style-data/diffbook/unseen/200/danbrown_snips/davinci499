every
shred
of
information
they
could
find
on
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
and
its
president,
Andre
Vernet.
"Seat
belts,
please,"
Teabing's
pilot
announced
as
the
Hawker
731
descended
into
a
gloomy
morning
drizzle.
"We'll
be
landing
in
five
minutes."
Teabing
felt
a
joyous
sense

As

up
and

the
far
side

the
cabin,
then
slid
aside
a
wall
panel
to
reveal
a
discreetly
