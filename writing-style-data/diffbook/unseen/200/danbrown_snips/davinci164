a
doll.
Dejected,
she
opened
the
final
drawer
and
pulled
aside
some
black
clothes
she
had
never
seen
him
wear.
She
was
about
to
close
the
drawer
when
her
eyes
caught
a
glint
of
gold
in
the
back
of
the
drawer.
It
looked
like
a
pocket

chain,
but
she

Her

cross.
This
was
an
even
armed
one,
like
a
plus
sign.
Embossed
in
the
middle
of
the
cross
was
a
strange
symbol
two
letters
intertwined
with
some
kind
of
flowery
design.
"P.S.,"
she
whispered,
scowling
as
she
read
the
letters.
Whatever
could
this
be?
"Sophie?"
her
grandfather
spoke
from
the
doorway.
Startled,
she
spun,
dropping
the
key
on
the
floor
