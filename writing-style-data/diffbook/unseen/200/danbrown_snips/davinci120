and
Fache
was
pacing
like
a
caged
lion.
"Why
did
Crypto
call?"
Collet
now
ventured.
Fache
turned.
"To
tell
us
they
found
no
references
to
Draconian
devils
and
lame
saints."
"That's
all?"
"No,
also
to
tell
us
that
they
had
just
identified
the
numerics
as
Fibonacci
numbers,
but
they
suspected
the
series
was
meaningless."
Collet
was
confused.
"But

already
sent
Agent
Neveu
to
tell
us
that."
Fache

She's
never
seen
a
picture
of
a
dead
body?"
Fache
was
silent
a
moment.
"I
was
not
aware
of
this,
and
it
seems
neither
was
the
director
until
a
coworker
informed
him,
but
apparently
Sophie
Neveu
is
Jacques
Sauniere's
granddaughter."
Collet
was
speechless.
"The
director
said
she
never
once
mentioned
Sauniere
