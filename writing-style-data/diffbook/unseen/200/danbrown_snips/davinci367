reverence
for
the
sacred
feminine."
Sophie
shook
her
head.
"I'm
sorry,
when
you
said
the
Holy
Grail
was
a
person,
I
thought
you
meant
it
was
an
actual
person."
"It
is,"
Langdon
said.
"And
not
just
any
person,"
Teabing
blurted,
clambering
excitedly
to
his
feet.
"A
woman
who
carried
with
her
a
secret
so
powerful
that,
if
revealed,
it
threatened
to
devastate
the
very
foundation
of
Christianity!"
Sophie
looked
overwhelmed.
"Is
this
woman
well
known
in
history?"
"Quite."
Teabing
collected
his
crutches
and
motioned
down
the
hall.
"And
if
we
adjourn
to
the
study,
my
friends,
it
would
be
my
honor
to
show
you
Da
Vinci's
painting
of
her."
Two
rooms
away,
in
the
kitchen,
manservant
Remy
Legaludec
stood
in
silence
before
a
television.
The
news
station
was
broadcasting
photos
of
a
man
and
woman
the
same
two
individuals
to
whom
Remy
had
just
served
tea.
Standing
at
the
roadblock
outside
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich,
Lieutenant
Collet
wondered
what
was
taking
Fache
so
long
to
come
up
with
the
search
warrant.
The
bankers
were
obviously
hiding
something.
They
claimed
Langdon
and
Neveu
had
arrived
earlier
and
were
turned
away
from
the
bank
because
they
did
not
have
proper
account
