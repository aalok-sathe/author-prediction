They
are
simply
letters
written
out
of
order."
Sophie
needed
only
an
instant
to
process
Langdon's
implication,
and
it
seemed
laughably
simple.
"You
think
this
message
is
une
anagramme?"
She
stared
at
him.
"Like
a
word
jumble
from
a
newspaper?"
Langdon
could
see
the
skepticism
on
Sophie's
face
and
certainly
understood.
Few
people
realized
that
anagrams,
despite
being
a
trite
modern
amusement,
had
a
rich
history
of
sacred
symbolism.
The
mystical
teachings
of
the
Kabbala
drew
heavily
on
anagrams
rearranging
the
letters
of
Hebrew
words
to
derive
new
meanings.
French
kings
throughout
the
Renaissance
were
so
convinced
that
anagrams
held
magic
power
that
they
appointed
royal
anagrammatists
to
help
them
make
better
decisions
by
analyzing
words
in
important
documents.
The
Romans
actually
referred
to
the
study
of
anagrams
as
ars
magna
"the
great
art."
Langdon
looked
up
at
Sophie,
locking
eyes
with
her
now.
"Your
grandfather's
meaning
was
right
in
front
of
us
all
along,
and
he
left
us
more
than
enough
clues
to
see
it.
Without
another
word,
Langdon
pulled
a
pen
from
his
jacket
pocket
and
rearranged
the
letters
in
each
line.
O,
Draconian
devil!
Oh,
lame
saint!
was
a
perfect
anagram
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci!
