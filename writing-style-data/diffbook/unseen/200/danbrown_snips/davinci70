children.
And
once
for
shaming
the
good
name
of
the
Catholic
Church.
Collet
had
the
odd
sense
it
was
the
latter
that
angered
Fache
more.
Turning
now
to
his
laptop
computer,
Collet
attended
to
the
other
half
of
his
responsibilities
here
tonight
the
GPS
tracking
system.
The
image
onscreen
revealed
a
detailed
floor
plan
of
the
Denon
Wing,
a
structural
schematic
uploaded
from
the
Louvre
Security
Office.
Letting
his
eyes
trace
the

Deep

Fache

tonight.
Wisely
so.
Robert

off
his
cellular
phone.
Unfortunately,
it
was
an
expensive
model
equipped
with
a
two
way
radio
feature,
which,
contrary
to
his
orders,
was
now
being
used
by
one
of
his
agents
to
page
him.
"Capitaine?"
The
phone
crackled
like
a
walkie
talkie.
Fache
felt
his
teeth
clench
in
rage.
He
could
imagine
nothing
important
enough
that
Collet
would
interrupt
this
surveillance
cachee
