The
ultimate
research
tool,
Langdon
had
heard.
Instant
answers
to
any
religious
historical
question.
He
wondered
what
the
database
would
have
to
say
about
"a
knight
a
Pope
interred."
He
stood
up
and
paced,
wishing
the
train
would
hurry.
At
the
pay
phone,
Sophie's
call
finally
connected
to
the
London
police.
"Snow
Hill
Division,"
the
dispatcher
said.
"How
may
I
direct
your
call?"
"I'm
reporting
a
kidnapping."
Sophie
knew
to
be
concise.
"Name
please?"
Sophie
paused.
"Agent
Sophie
Neveu
with
the
French
Judicial
Police."
The
title
had
the
desired
effect.
"Right
away,
ma'am.
Let
me
get
a
detective
on
the
line
for
you."
As
the
call
went
through,
Sophie
began
wondering
if
the
police
would
even
believe
her
description
of
Teabing's
captors.
A
man
in
a
tuxedo.
How
much
easier
to
identify
could
a
suspect
be?
Even
if
Remy
changed
clothes,
he
was
partnered
with
an
albino
monk.
Impossible
to
miss.
Moreover,
they
had
a
hostage
and
could
not
take
public
transportation.
She
wondered
how
many
Jaguar
stretch
limos
there
could
be
in
London.
Sophie's
connection
to
the
detective
seemed
to
be
taking
forever.
Come
on!
She
could
hear
the
line
clicking
and
buzzing,
as
if
she
was
being
transferred.
