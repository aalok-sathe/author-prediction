years.
Their
ascension
to
grace
was
jump
started
in
1982
when
Pope
John
Paul
II
unexpectedly
elevated
them
to
a
"personal
prelature
of
the
Pope,"
officially
sanctioning
all
of
their
practices.
Suspiciously,
Opus
Dei's
elevation
occurred
the
same
year
the
wealthy
sect
allegedly
had
transferred
almost
one
billion
dollars
into
the
Vatican's
Institute
for
Religious
Works
commonly
known
as
the
Vatican
Bank
bailing
it
out
of
an
embarrassing
bankruptcy.
In
a
second
maneuver
that
raised
eyebrows,
the
Pope
placed
the
founder
of
Opus
Dei
on
the
"fast
track"
for
sainthood,
accelerating
an
often

long
waiting
period
for
canonization
to
a
mere
twenty

feel
that
Opus
Dei's
good
standing
in
Rome
was
suspect,
but
one
did
not
argue
with
the
Holy
See.
"Bishop
Aringarosa
called
to
ask
me
a
favor,"
the
abbe
told
her,
his
voice
nervous.
"One
of
his
numeraries
is
in
Paris
tonight."
As
Sister
Sandrine
listened
to
the
odd
request,
she
felt
a
deepening
confusion.
"I'm
sorry,
you
say
this
visiting
Opus
Dei
numerary
cannot
wait
until
morning?"
"I'm
afraid
not.
His
plane
leaves
very
early.
He
has
always
dreamed
of
seeing
Saint
Sulpice."
"But
