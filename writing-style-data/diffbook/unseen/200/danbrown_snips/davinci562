Fifteen
seconds
passed.
Finally
a
man
came
on
the
line.
"Agent
Neveu?"
Stunned,
Sophie
registered
the
gruff
tone
immediately.
"Agent
Neveu,"
Bezu
Fache
demanded.
"Where
the
hell
are
you?"
Sophie
was
speechless.
Captain
Fache
had
apparently
requested
the
London
police
dispatcher
alert
him
if
Sophie
called
in.
"Listen,"
Fache
said,
speaking
to
her
in
terse
French.
"I
made
a
terrible
mistake
tonight.
Robert

however,
you
and
Langdon
need
to
go
to
the
nearest
London
police
headquarters
for
refuge."
He
knows
I'm
in
London?
What
else
does
Fache
know?
Sophie
heard
what
sounded
like
drilling
or
machinery
in
the
background.
She
also
heard
an
odd

on
the
line.
"Are

Captain?"
Fache's
voice
