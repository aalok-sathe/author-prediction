"Okay,"
Sophie
said,
"but
if
Baphomet
is
the
headstone
praised
by
Templars,
then
we
have
a
new
dilemma."
She
pointed
to
the
dials
on
the
cryptex.
"Baphomet
has
eight
letters.
We
only
have
room
for
five.
Teabing
grinned
broadly.
"My
dear,
this
is
where
the
Atbash
Cipher
comes
into
play"
Langdon
was
impressed.
Teabing
had
just
finished
writing
out
the
entire
twenty
two

Hebrew
alphabet
alef

Teabing
dramatically
mopped
his
brow
and
plowed
on.
"In
formal
Hebrew

the
vowel

not
written.
Therefore,
when
we
write
the
word
Baphomet
using
the
Hebrew
alphabet,
it
will
lose
its

Sophie
blurted.
Teabing
nodded
and
began
writing
again.
"Okay,
here

the
proper
spelling
