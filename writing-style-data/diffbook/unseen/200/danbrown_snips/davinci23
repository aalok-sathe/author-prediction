the
sunken
atrium
beneath
the
glass
pyramid.
As
they
descended,
they
passed
between
two
armed
Judicial
Police
guards
with
machine
guns.
The
message
was
clear:
Nobody
goes
in
or
out
tonight
without
the
blessing
of
Captain
Fache.
Descending
below
ground
level,
Langdon
fought
a
rising
trepidation.
Fache's
presence
was
anything
but
welcoming,
and
the
Louvre
itself
had
an
almost
sepulchral
aura
at
this
hour.
The
staircase,
like
the
aisle
of
a
dark
movie
theater,
was
illuminated
by
subtle
tread
lighting
embedded
in
each
step.
Langdon
could
hear
his
own
footsteps
reverberating
off
the
glass
overhead.
As
he
glanced
up,
he
could
see
the
faint
illuminated
wisps
of
mist
from
the
fountains
fading
away
outside
the
transparent
roof.
"Do
you
approve?"
Fache
asked,
nodding
upward
with
his
broad
chin.
Langdon
sighed,
too
tired
to
play
games.
"Yes,
your
pyramid
is
magnificent."
Fache
grunted.
"A
scar
on
the
face
of
Paris."
Strike
one.
Langdon
sensed
his
host
was
a
hard
man
to
please.
He
wondered
if
Fache
had
any
idea
that
this
pyramid,
at
President
Mitterrand's
explicit
demand,
had
been
constructed
of
exactly
666
panes
of
glass
a
bizarre
request
that
had
always
been
a
hot
topic
among
conspiracy
buffs
who
