On
his
way
out,
he
grabbed
a
driver's
pistol
from
the
rack,
put
in
a
clip,
and
stuffed
it
in
the
holster,
buttoning
his
uniform
over
it.
Returning
to
the
truck,
Vernet
pulled
the
driver's
cap
down
low
and
peered
in
at
Sophie
and
Langdon,
who
were
standing
inside
the
empty
steel
box.
"You'll
want
this
on,"
Vernet
said,
reaching
inside
and
flicking
a
wall
switch
to
illuminate
the
lone
courtesy
bulb
on
the
hold's
ceiling.
"And
you'd
better
sit
down.
Not
a
sound
on
our
way
out
the
gate."
Sophie
and
Langdon
sat
down
on
the
metal
floor.
Langdon
cradled
the
treasure
wadded
in
his
tweed
jacket.
Swinging
the
heavy
doors
closed,
Vernet
locked
them
inside.
Then
he
got
in
behind
the
wheel
and
revved
the
engine.
As
the
armored
truck
lumbered
toward
the
top
of
the
ramp,
Vernet
could
feel
the
sweat
already
collecting
beneath
his
driver's
cap.
He
could
see
there
were
far
more
police
lights
in
front
than
he
had
imagined.
As
the
truck
powered
up
the
ramp,
the
interior
gate
swung
inward
to
let
him
pass.
Vernet
advanced
and
waited
while
the
gate
behind
him
closed
before
pulling
forward
and
tripping
the
next
sensor.
The
