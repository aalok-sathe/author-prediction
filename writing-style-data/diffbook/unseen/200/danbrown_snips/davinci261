to
tell
Langdon
what
she
had
witnessed
that
night
in
the
Normandy
chateau.
For
ten
years
now,
simple
shame
had
kept
her
from
telling
a
soul.
Just
thinking
about
it,
she
shuddered.
Sirens
howled
somewhere
in
the
distance,
and
she
felt
a
thickening
shroud
of
fatigue

Sophie

pointing.
Langdon's
eyes
followed
to
the
structure
ahead.
What
in
the
world?
The
building
was
modern.
A
squat
citadel
with
a
giant,
neon
equal
armed
cross
emblazoned
atop
its
facade.
Beneath
the
cross
were
the
words:
