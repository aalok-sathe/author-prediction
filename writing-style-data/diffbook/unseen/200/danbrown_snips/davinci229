BIBLIOTECA
ASTRONOMICA
Aringarosa
had
heard
of
this
place
the
Vatican's
Astronomy
Library
rumored
to
contain
more
than
twenty
five
thousand
volumes,
including
rare
works
of
Copernicus,
Galileo,
Kepler,
Newton,
and
Secchi.
Allegedly,
it
was
also
the
place
in
which
the
Pope's
highest
officers
held
private
meetings
those
meetings
they
preferred
not
to
hold
within
the
walls
of
Vatican
City.
Approaching
the
door,
Bishop
Aringarosa
would
never
have
imagined
the
shocking
news
he
was
about
to
receive
inside,
or
the
deadly
chain
of
events
it
would
put
into
motion.
It
was
not
until
an
hour
later,
as
he
staggered
from
the
meeting,
that
the
devastating
implications
settled
in.
Six
months
from
now!
he
had
thought.
God
help
us!
Now,
seated
in
the
Fiat,
Bishop
Aringarosa
realized
his
fists
were
clenched
just
thinking
about
that
first
meeting.
He
released
his
grip
and
forced
a
slow
inhalation,
relaxing
his
muscles.
Everything
will
be
fine,
he
told
himself
as
the
Fiat
wound
higher
into
the
mountains.
Still,
he
wished
his
cell
phone
would
ring.
Why
hasn't
the
Teacher
called
me?
Silas
should
have
the
keystone
by
now.
