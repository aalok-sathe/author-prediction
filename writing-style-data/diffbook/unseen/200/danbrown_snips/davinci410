hidden."
He
paused.
"However,
part
of
the
Priory
history
has
always
included
a
plan
to
unveil
the
secret.
With
the
arrival
of
a
specific
date
in
history,
the
brotherhood
plans
to
break
the
silence
and
carry
out
its
ultimate
triumph
by
unveiling
the
Sangreal
documents
to
the
world
and
shouting
the
true
story
of
Jesus
Christ
from
the
mountaintops."
Sophie
stared
at
Teabing
in
silence.
Finally,
she
too
sat
down.
"And
you
think
that
date
is
approaching?
And
the
Church
knows
it?"
"A
speculation,"
Teabing
said,
"but
it
would
certainly
provide
the
Church
motivation
for
an
all
out
attack
to
find
the
documents
before
it
was
too
late.
Langdon
had
the
uneasy
feeling
that
Teabing
was
making
good
sense.
"Do
you
think
the
Church
would
actually
be
capable
of
uncovering
hard
evidence
of
the
Priory's
date?"
"Why
not
if
we're
assuming
the
Church
was
able
to
uncover
the
identities
of
the
Priory
members,
then
certainly
they
could
have
learned
of
their
plans.
And
even
if
they
don't
have
the
exact
date,
their
superstitions
may
be
getting
the
best
of
them."
"Superstitions?"
Sophie
asked.
"In
terms
of
prophecy,"
Teabing
said,
"we
are
currently
in
an
epoch
of
enormous
change.
The
