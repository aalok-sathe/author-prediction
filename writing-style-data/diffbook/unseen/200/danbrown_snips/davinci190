swing,
the
covering
finally
shattered,
and
stone
shards
fell
into
a
hollow
area
beneath
the
floor.
A
compartment!
Quickly
pulling
the
remaining
pieces
from
the
opening,
Silas
gazed
into
the
void.
His
blood
pounded
as
he
knelt
down
before
it.
Raising
his
pale
bare
arm,
he
reached
inside.
At
first
he
felt
nothing.
The
floor
of
the
compartment
was
bare,
smooth
stone.
Then,
feeling
deeper,
reaching
his
arm
in
under
the
Rose
Line,
he
touched
something!
A
thick
stone
tablet.
Getting
his
fingers
around
the
edge,
he
gripped
it
and
gently
lifted
the
tablet
out.
As
he
stood
and
examined
his
find,
he
realized
he
was
holding
a
rough
hewn
stone
slab
with
engraved
words.
He
felt
for
an
instant
like
a
modern
day
Moses.
As
Silas
read
the
words
on
the
tablet,
he
felt
surprise.
He
had
expected
the
keystone
to
be
a
map,
or
a
complex
series
of
directions,
perhaps
even
encoded.
The
keystone,
however,
bore
the
simplest
of
inscriptions.
Job
38:11
A
Bible
verse
?
Silas
was
stunned
with
the
devilish
simplicity.
The
secret
location
of
that
which
they
sought
was
revealed
in
a
Bible
verse?
The
brotherhood
stopped
at
nothing
to
mock
the
righteous!
Job.
