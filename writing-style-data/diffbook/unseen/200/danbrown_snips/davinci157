of
the
pyramidical
apex,
where
it
finally
ceased.
The
Rose
Line,
Silas
thought.
The
brotherhood
hid
the
keystone
at
the
Rose
Line.
Earlier
tonight,
when
Silas
told
the
Teacher
that
the
Priory
keystone
was
hidden
inside
Saint
Sulpice,
the
Teacher
had
sounded
doubtful.
But
when
Silas
added
that
the
brothers
had
all
given
him
a
precise
location,
with
relation
to
a
brass
line
running
through
Saint
Sulpice,
the
Teacher
had
gasped
with
revelation.
"You
speak
of
the
Rose
Line!"
The
Teacher
quickly
told
Silas
of
Saint
Sulpice's
famed
architectural
oddity
a
strip
of
brass
that
segmented
the
sanctuary
on
a
perfect
north
south
axis.
It
was
an
ancient
sundial
of
sorts,
a
vestige
of
the
pagan
temple
that
had
once
stood
on
this
very
spot.
The
sun's
rays,
shining
through
the
oculus
on
the
south
wall,
moved
farther
down
the
line
every
day,
indicating
the
passage
of
time,
from
solstice
to
solstice.
The
north
south
stripe
had
been
known
as
the
Rose
Line.
For
centuries,
the
symbol
of
the
Rose
had
been
associated
with
maps
and
guiding
souls
in
the
proper
direction.
The
Compass
Rose
drawn
on
almost
every
map
indicated
North,
East,
South,
and
West.
Originally
known
as
the
