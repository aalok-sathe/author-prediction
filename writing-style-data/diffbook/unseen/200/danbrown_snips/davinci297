probing
as
if
trying
to
read
Vernet's
mind.
A
drop
of
sweat
was
preparing
to
slide
down
Vernet's
nose.
"You
mind?"
he
said,
wiping
his
nose
with
his
sleeve
and
motioning
to
the
police
car
blocking
his
way.
"I'm
on
a
tight
schedule."
"Do
all
the
drivers
wear
Rolexes?"
the
agent
asked,
pointing
to
Vernet's
wrist.
Vernet
glanced
down
and
saw
the
glistening
band
of
his
absurdly
expensive
watch
peeking
out
from
beneath
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket.
Merde.
"This
piece
of
shit?
Bought
it
for
twenty
euro
from
a
Taiwanese
street
vendor
in
St.
Germain
des
Pres.
I'll
sell
it
to
you
for
forty."
The
agent
paused
and
finally
stepped
aside.
"No
thanks.
Have
a
safe
trip."
Vernet
did
not
breathe
again
until
the
truck
was
a
good
fifty
meters
down
the
street.
And
now
he
had
another
problem.
His
cargo.
Where
do
I
take
them?
Silas
lay
prone
on
the
canvas
mat
in
his
room,
allowing
the
lash
wounds
on
his
back
to
clot
in
the
air.
Tonight's
second
session
with
the
Discipline
had
left
him
dizzy
and
weak.
He
had
yet
to
remove
the
cilice
belt,
and
he
could
feel
the
blood
trickling
down
his
inner
thigh.
