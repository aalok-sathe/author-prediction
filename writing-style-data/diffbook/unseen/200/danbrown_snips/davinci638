the
silence
of
Langdon's
mind.
There
was
no
viable
response,
Langdon
knew.
Answer
yes,
and
he
would
be
selling
out
Sophie.
Answer
no,
and
Teabing
would
have
no
choice
but
to
kill
them
both.
Langdon's
years
in
the
classroom
had
not
imbued
him
with
any
skills
relevant
to
handling
confrontations
at
gunpoint,
but
the
classroom
had
taught
him
something
about
answering
paradoxical
questions.
When
a
question
has
no
correct
answer,
there
is
only
one
honest
response.
The
gray
area
between
yes
and
no.
Silence.
Staring
at
the
cryptex
in
his
hands,
Langdon
chose
simply
to
walk
away.
Without
ever
lifting
his
eyes,
he
stepped
backward,
out
into
the
room's
vast
empty
spaces.
Neutral
ground.
He
hoped
his
focus
on
the
cryptex
signaled
Teabing
that
collaboration
might
be
an
option,
and
that
his
silence
signaled
Sophie
he
had
not
abandoned
her.
All
the
while
buying
time
to
think.
The
act
of
thinking,
Langdon
suspected,
was
exactly
what
Teabing
wanted
him
to
do.
That's
why
he
handed
me
the
cryptex.
So
I
could
feel
the
weight
of
my
decision.
The
British
historian
hoped
the
touch
of
the
Grand
Master's
cryptex
would
make
Langdon
fully
grasp
the
magnitude
of
its
contents,
coaxing
his
