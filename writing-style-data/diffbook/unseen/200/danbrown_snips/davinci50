of
all
people,
would
know
this."
"Sauniere
drew
a
goddess
symbol
on
his
stomach?"
Langdon
had
to
admit,
it
seemed
odd.
"In
its
most
specific
interpretation,
the
pentacle
symbolizes
Venus
the
goddess
of
female
sexual
love
and
beauty."
Fache
eyed
the
naked
man,
and
grunted.
"Early
religion
was
based
on
the
divine
order
of
Nature.
The
goddess
Venus
and
the
planet
Venus
were
one
and
the

goddess
had
a
place

not
to
share
the
pentacle's
most
astonishing

the
graphic
origin
of
its
ties
to
Venus.
As
a
young
astronomy
student,
Langdon
had
been
stunned
to
learn
the
planet
Venus
traced
a
perfect
pentacle
across
the
ecliptic
sky
every
four
years.
So
astonished
were
the
ancients
to
observe
this
phenomenon,
that
Venus
and
her
pentacle
became
symbols
of
perfection,
beauty,
and
the
cyclic
qualities
of
sexual
love.
As
a
tribute
to
the
magic
of
Venus,
the
Greeks
