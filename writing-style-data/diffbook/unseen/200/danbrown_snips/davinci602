moved
into
an
obscure
side
aisle
behind
a
row
of
pilasters.
Langdon
couldn't
shake
the
image
of
Leigh
Teabing
being
held
captive,
probably
tied
up
in
the
back
of
his
own
limousine.
Whoever
had
ordered
the
top
Priory
members
killed
would
not
hesitate
to
eliminate
others
who
stood
in
the
way.
It
seemed
a
cruel
irony
that
Teabing
a
modern
British
knight
was
a
hostage
in
the
search
for
his
own
countryman,
Sir
Isaac
Newton.
"Which
way
is
it?"
Sophie
asked,
looking
around.
The
tomb.
Langdon
had
no

"We

Westminster
Abbey
was
a
tangled
warren
of
mausoleums,

chambers,
and

niches.
Like
the
Louvre's
Grand
Gallery,
it
had
a
lone
point
of
entry
the
door
through
which
they
had
just
passed
easy
to
find
your
way
in,
but
impossible
to
find
your
way
out.
A
literal
tourist
trap,
one
of
Langdon's
befuddled
colleagues
had
called
it.
Keeping
architectural
tradition,
the
abbey
was
laid
out
in
the
shape
of
a
giant
crucifix.
Unlike
most
churches,
however,
it
had
its
entrance
on
the
side,
rather
than
the
standard
rear

the
church
