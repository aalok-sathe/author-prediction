in
Paris
were
progressing,
he
wished
he
could
phone
Silas.
But
he
could
not.
The
Teacher
had
seen
to
that.
"It
is
for
your
own
safety,"
the
Teacher
had
explained,
speaking
in
English
with
a
French
accent.
"I
am
familiar
enough
with
electronic
communications
to
know
they
can
be
intercepted.
The
results
could
be
disastrous
for
you.
Aringarosa
knew
he
was
right.
The
Teacher
seemed
an
exceptionally
careful
man.
He
had
not
revealed
his
own
identity
to
Aringarosa,
and
yet
he
had
proven
himself
a
man
well
worth
obeying.
After
all,
he
had
somehow
obtained
very
secret
information.
The
names
of
the
brotherhood'
s
four
top
members!
This
had
been
one
of
the
coups
that
convinced
the
bishop
the
Teacher
was
truly
capable
of
delivering
the
astonishing
prize
he
claimed
he
could
unearth.
"Bishop,"
the
Teacher
had
told
him,
"I
have
made
all
the
arrangements.
For
my
plan
to
succeed,
you
must
allow
Silas
to
answer
only
to
me
for
several
days.
The
two
of
you
will
not
speak.
I
will
communicate
with
him
through
secure
channels."
"You
will
treat
him
with
respect?"
"A
man
of
faith
deserves
the
highest."
"Excellent.
Then
I
understand.
Silas
and
I
shall
not
speak
