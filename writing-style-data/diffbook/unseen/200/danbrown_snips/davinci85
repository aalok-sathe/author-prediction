of
Spain."
"How
did
I
get
here?"
"Someone
left
you
on
my
doorstep.
You
were
ill.
I
fed
you.
You've
been
here
many
days."
The
ghost
studied
his
young
caretaker.
Years
had
passed
since
anyone
had
shown
any
kindness.
"Thank

Father."

prison
and
freed
many
dangerous
criminals.
His
heart
began
pounding.
The
priest
knows
who
I
am!
The
emotion
he
felt
was
one
he
had
not
felt

accompanied
by
the
fear
of
being

He
jumped
from
his
bed.
