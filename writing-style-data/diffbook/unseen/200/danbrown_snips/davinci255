along
Allee
de
Longchamp,
leaving
the
Garden
of
Earthly
Delights
behind.
"Which
way
is
Rue
Haxo?"
Langdon
asked,
watching
Sophie
edge
the
speedometer
over
a
hundred
kilometers
an
hour.
Sophie's
eyes
remained
focused
on
the
road.
"The
cab
driver
said
it's
adjacent
to
the
Roland
Garros
tennis
stadium.
I
know
that
area."
Langdon
pulled
the
heavy
key
from
his
pocket
again,
feeling
the
weight
in
his
palm.
He
sensed
it
was
an
object
of
enormous
consequence.
Quite
possibly
the
key
to
his
own
freedom.
Earlier,
while
telling
Sophie
about
the
Knights
Templar,
Langdon
had
realized
that
this
key,
in
addition
to
having
the
Priory
seal
embossed
on
it,
possessed
a
more
subtle
tie
to
the
Priory
of
Sion.
The
equal
armed
cruciform
was
symbolic
of
balance
and
harmony
but
also
of
the
Knights
Templar.
Everyone
had
seen
the
paintings
of
Knights
Templar
wearing
white
tunics
emblazoned
with
red
equal
armed
crosses.
Granted,
the
arms
of
the
Templar
cross
were
slightly
flared
at
the
ends,
but
they
were
still
of
equal
length.
A
square
cross.
Just
like
the
one
on
this
key.
Langdon
felt
his
imagination
starting
to
run
wild
as
he
fantasized
about
what
they
might
find.
The
Holy
Grail.
