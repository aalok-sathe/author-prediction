that
I
would
much
prefer
to
receive
the
keystone
from
you
a
man
of
God
rather
than
a
criminal
but
Remy
must
be
dealt
with.
He
disobeyed
my
orders
and
made
a
grave
mistake
that
has
put
our
entire
mission
at
risk.
Silas
felt
a
chill
and
glanced

He

For
your
own
safety,
you
need
to
get
off
the
street

The
police
