sailing
above
Silas's
head,
just
as
he
connected
with
the
officer's
shins,
driving
his
legs
out
from
under
him,
and
sending
the
man
down,
his
head
hitting
the
floor.
The
second
officer
staggered
to
his
feet
in
the
doorway,
and
Silas
drove
a
knee
into
his
groin,
then
went
clambering
over
the
writhing
body
into
the
hall.
Almost
naked,
Silas
hurled
his
pale
body
down
the
staircase.
He
knew
he
had
been
betrayed,
but
by
whom?
When
he
reached
the
foyer,
more
officers
were
surging
through
the
front

Silas
turned
the
other
way
and
dashed
deeper

residence

The

Every
Opus
Dei
building
has

Winding
down
narrow
hallways,
Silas
snaked
through
a
kitchen,
past
terrified
workers,
who
left
to
avoid
the
naked
albino
as
he
knocked
over
bowls
and
silverware,
bursting
into
a
dark
hallway
near
the
boiler
room.
He
now
saw
the
door
he
sought,
an
exit
light
gleaming
at
the
end.
Running
full
speed
through
the
door
out
into
the
rain,
Silas
leapt
off
the
low
landing,
not
seeing
the
officer
coming
the
other
way
until
it
was
too
late.
The
two
men
collided,
Silas's
broad,
naked
shoulder
grinding
