academic
curiosity

overwhelm
all
else,
forcing
him
to
realize
that
failure
to
unlock
the
keystone
would
mean
the
loss
of
history
itself.
With
Sophie
at
gunpoint
across
the
room,
Langdon
feared
that
discovering
the
cryptex's
elusive
password
would
be
his
only
remaining
hope
of
bartering
her
release.
If
I
can
free
the
map,
Teabing
will
negotiate.
Forcing
his
mind
to
this
critical
task,
Langdon
moved
slowly
toward
the
far
windows
allowing
his
mind
to
fill
with
the
numerous
astronomical
images
on
Newton's
tomb.
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
It
speaks
of
Rosy
flesh
and
seeded
womb.
Turning
his
back
to
the
others,
he
walked
toward
the
towering
windows,
searching
for
any
inspiration
in
their
stained
glass
mosaics.
There
was
none.
Place
yourself
in
Sauniere's
mind,
he
urged,
gazing
outward
now
into
College
Garden.
What
would
he
believe
is
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
Newton's
tomb?
Images
of
stars,
comets,
and
planets
twinkled
in
the
falling
rain,
but
Langdon
ignored
them.
Sauniere
was
not
a
man
of
science.
He
was
a
man
of
humanity,
of
art,
of
history.
