himself
might
even
learn
from
it.
To
successfully
hide
bugs
in
some
of
Paris's
most
powerful
offices,
the
British
historian
had
turned
to
the
Greeks.
Trojan
horses.
Some
of
Teabing's
intended
targets
received
lavish
gifts
of
artwork,
others
unwittingly
bid
at
auctions
in
which
Teabing
had
placed
specific
lots.
In
Sauniere's
case,
the
curator
had
received
a
dinner
invitation
to
Chateau
Villette
to
discuss
the
possibility
of
Teabing's
funding
a
new
Da
Vinci
Wing
at
the
Louvre.
Sauniere's
invitation
had
contained
an
innocuous
postscript
expressing
fascination
with
a
robotic
knight
that
Sauniere
was
rumored
to
have
built.
Bring
him
to
dinner,
Teabing
had
suggested.
Sauniere
apparently
had
done
just
that
and
left
the
knight
unattended
long
enough
for
Remy
Legaludec
to
make
one
inconspicuous
addition.
Now,
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
cab,
Fache
closed
his
eyes.
One
more
thing
to
attend
to
before
I
return
to
Paris.
The
St.
Mary's
Hospital
recovery
room
was
sunny.
"You've
impressed
us
all,"
the
nurse
said,
smiling
down
at
him.
"Nothing
short
of
miraculous."
Bishop
Aringarosa
gave
a
weak
smile.
"I
have
always
been
blessed."
The
nurse
finished
puttering,
leaving
the
bishop
alone.
The
sunlight
felt
welcome
and
warm
on
his
face.
