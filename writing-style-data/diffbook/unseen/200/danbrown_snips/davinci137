reeling
back
to
Harvard,
standing
in
front
of
his
"Symbolism
in
Art"
class,
writing
his
favorite
number
on
the
chalkboard.

Langdon
turned
to
face
his
sea
of
eager
students.
"Who
can
tell
me
what
this
number
is?"
A
long
legged
math
major
in
back
raised
his
hand.
"That's
the
number
PHI."
He
pronounced
it
fee.
"Nice
job,
Stettner,"
Langdon
said.
"Everyone,
meet
PHI."
"Not
to
be
confused
with
PI,"
Stettner
added,
grinning.
"As
we
mathematicians
like
to
say:
PHI
is
one
H
of
a
lot
cooler
than
PI
!
Langdon
laughed,
but
nobody
else
seemed
to
get
the
joke.
Stettner
slumped.
"This
number
PHI,"
Langdon
continued,
"one
point
six
one
eight,
is
a
very
important
number
in
art.
Who
can
tell
me
why?"
Stettner
tried
to
redeem
himself.
"Because
it's
so
pretty?"
Everyone
laughed.
"Actually,"
Langdon
said,
"Stettner's
right
again.
PHI
is
generally
considered
the
most
beautiful
number
in
the
universe."
The
laughter
abruptly
stopped,
and
Stettner
gloated.
As
Langdon
loaded
his
slide
projector,
he
explained
that
the
number
PHI
was
derived
from
the
Fibonacci
sequence
a
progression
famous
not
only
because
the
sum
of
adjacent
terms
equaled
the
next
term,
but
because
the
quotients
of
adjacent
terms
