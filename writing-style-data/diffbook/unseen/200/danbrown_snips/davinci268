enormous
metal
brick,
the
edifice
sat
back
from
the
road
with
a
fifteen
foot
tall,
neon,
equilateral
cross
glowing
over
its
facade.
Switzerland's
reputation
for
secrecy
in
banking
had
become
one
of
the
country's
most
lucrative
exports.
Facilities
like
this
had
become
controversial
in
the
art
community
because
they
provided
a
perfect
place
for
art
thieves
to
hide
stolen
goods,
for
years
if
necessary,
until
the
heat
was
off.
Because
deposits
were
protected
from
police
inspection
by
privacy
laws
and
were
attached
to
numbered
accounts
rather
than
people's
names,
thieves
could
rest
easily
knowing
their
stolen
goods
were
safe
and
could
never
be
traced
to
them.
Sophie
stopped
the
taxi
at
an
imposing
gate
that
blocked
the
bank's
driveway
a
cement
lined
ramp
that
descended
beneath
the
building.
A
video
camera
overhead
was
aimed
directly
at
them,
and
Langdon
had
the
feeling
that
this
camera,
unlike
those
at
the
Louvre,
was
authentic.
Sophie
rolled
down
the
window
and
surveyed
the
electronic
podium
on
the
driver's
side.
An
LCD
screen
provided
directions
in
seven
languages.
Topping
the
list
was
English.
INSERT
KEY.
Sophie
took
the
gold
laser
pocked
key
from
her
pocket
and
turned
her
attention
back
to
the
podium.
