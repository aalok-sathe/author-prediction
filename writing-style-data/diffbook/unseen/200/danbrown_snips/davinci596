familiar
sounds
and
should
have
comforted
him.
And
yet
he
felt
a
sudden
and
unexpected
wariness.
Standing,
wearing
only
his
undergarments,
Silas
walked
to
the
window.
Was
I
followed?
The
courtyard
below
was
deserted,
exactly
as
he
had
seen
it
when
he
entered.
He

Silence.
So

Long

Silas
had

Intuition

behind
the
door
as
it
crashed
open.
The
first
police
officer
stormed
through,
swinging
his
gun

then
right
at
what
appeared
an
empty
room.
Before
he
realized
where
Silas
was,
Silas
had
thrown
his
shoulder
into
the
door,
crushing
a
second
officer
as
he
came
through.
As
the
first
officer
