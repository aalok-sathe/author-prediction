coordinates,
some
claimed
they
came
to
search
the
hillside
for
a
hidden
entrance
to
the
vault,
but
most
admitted
they
had
come
simply
to
wander
the
grounds
and
absorb
the
lore
of
the
Holy
Grail.
Although
Langdon
had
never
been
to
Rosslyn
before
now,
he
always
chuckled
when
he
heard
the
chapel
described
as
the
current
home
of
the
Holy
Grail.
Admittedly,
Rosslyn
once
might
have
been
home
to
the
Grail,
long
ago
but
certainly
no
longer.
Far
too
much
attention
had
been
drawn
to
Rosslyn
in
past
decades,
and
sooner
or
later
someone
would
find
a
way
to
break
into
the
vault.
True

academics
agreed
that
Rosslyn
was
a
decoy
one
of
the
devious
dead
ends
the
Priory
crafted
so
convincingly.
Tonight,
however,
with
the
Priory's
keystone
offering
a
verse
that
pointed
directly
to
this
spot,
Langdon
no
longer
felt
so
smug.
A
perplexing
question
had
been
running
through
his
mind
all
day:
Why
would
Sauniere
go
to
such
effort
to
guide
us
to
so
obvious
a
location?
There
seemed
only
one
logical
answer.
There
is
something
about
Rosslyn
we
have
yet
to
understand.
