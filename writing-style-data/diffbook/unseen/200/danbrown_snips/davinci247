something
else,
something
far
more
powerful."
He
paused.
"Something
that
fits
perfectly
with
everything
your
grandfather
has
been
trying
to
tell
us
tonight,
including
all
his
symbologic
references
to
the
sacred
feminine."
Still
unsure,
Sophie
sensed
in
Langdon's
patient
smile
that
he
empathized
with
her
confusion,
and
yet
his
eyes
remained
earnest.
"But
if
the
Holy
Grail
is
not
a
cup,"
she
asked,
"what
is
it?"
Langdon
had
known
this
question
was
coming,
and
yet
he
still
felt
uncertain
exactly
how
to
tell
her.
If
he
did
not
present
the
answer
in
the
proper
historical
background,
Sophie
would
be
left
with
a
vacant
air
of
bewilderment
the
exact
expression
Langdon
had
seen
on
his
own
editor's
face
a
few
months
ago
after
Langdon
handed
him
a
draft
of
the
manuscript
he
was
working
on.
"This
manuscript
claims
what?"
his
editor
had
choked,
setting
down
his
wineglass
and
staring
across
his
half
eaten
power
lunch.
"You
can't
be
serious."
"Serious
enough
to
have
spent
a
year
researching
it."
Prominent
New
York
editor
Jonas
Faukman
tugged
nervously
at
his
goatee.
Faukman
no
doubt
had
heard
some
wild
book
ideas
in
his
illustrious
career,
but
this
one
seemed
to
have
left
the
man
