that
you
have
not
yet
seen.
Fache
has
kept
it
carefully
hidden
from
you."
Langdon
could
only
stare.
"Do
you
recall
the
three
lines
of
text
that
Sauniere
wrote
on
the
floor?"
Langdon
nodded.
The
numbers
and
words
were
imprinted
on
Langdon's
mind.
Sophie's
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
now.
"Unfortunately,
what
you
saw
was
not
the
entire
message.
There
was
a
fourth
line
that
Fache
photographed
and
then
wiped
clean
before
you
arrived.
Although
Langdon
knew
the
soluble
ink
of
a
watermark
stylus
could
easily
be
wiped
away,
he
could
not
imagine
why
Fache
would
erase
evidence.
"The
last
line
of
the
message,"
Sophie
said,
"was
something
Fache
did
not
want
you
to
know
about."
She
paused.
"At
least
not
until
he
was
done
with
you."
Sophie
produced
a
computer
printout
of
a
photo
from
her
sweater
pocket
and
began
unfolding
it.
"Fache
uploaded
images
of
the
crime
scene
to
the
Cryptology
Department
earlier
tonight
in
hopes
we
could
figure
out
what
Sauniere's
message
was
trying
to
say.
This
is
a
photo
of
the
complete
message."
She
handed
the
page
to
Langdon.
Bewildered,
Langdon
looked
at
the
image.
The
close
up
photo
revealed
the
glowing
message
on
the
parquet
