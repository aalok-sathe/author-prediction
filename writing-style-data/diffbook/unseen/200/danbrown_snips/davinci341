British
take
milk."
"Milk,"
Langdon
said.
Silence.
"Sugar?"
Teabing
made
no
reply.
Wait!
Langdon
now
recalled
the
bitter
beverage
he
had
been
served
on
his
last
visit
and
realized
this
question
was
a
trick.
"Lemon!"
he
declared.
"Earl
Grey
with
lemon"
"Indeed."
Teabing
sounded
deeply
amused
now.
"And
finally,
I
must
make
the
most
grave
of
inquiries."
Teabing
paused
and
then
spoke
in
a
solemn
tone.
"In
which
year
did
a
Harvard
sculler
last
outrow
an
Oxford
man
at
Henley?"
Langdon
had
no
idea,
but
he
could
imagine
only
one
reason
the
question
had
been
asked.
"Surely
such
a
travesty
has
never
occurred.
The
gate
clicked
open.
"Your
heart
is
true,
my
friend.
You
may
pass."
"Monsieur
Vernet!"
The
night
manager
of
the
Depository
Bank
of
Zurich
felt
relieved
to
hear
the
bank
president's
voice
on
the
phone.
"Where
did
you
go,
sir?
The
police
are
here,
everyone
is
waiting
for
you!"
"I
have
a
little
problem,"
the
bank
president
said,
sounding
distressed.
"I
need
your
help
right
away."
You
have
more
than
a
little
problem,
the
manager
thought.
The
police
had
entirely
surrounded
the
bank
and
were
threatening
to
have
the
DCPJ
captain
himself
show
up
with
the
warrant
