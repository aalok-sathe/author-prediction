a
stop,
and
the
doors
opened.
Langdon
stepped
quickly
out
into
the
hallway,
eager
for
the
wide
open
space
afforded
by
the
famous
high
ceilings
of
the
Louvre
galleries.
The
world
into
which
he
stepped,
however,
was
nothing
like
he
expected.
Surprised,
Langdon
stopped
short.
Fache
glanced
over.
"I
gather,
Mr.
Langdon,
you
have
never
seen
the
Louvre
after
hours?"
guess
not,
Langdon
thought,
trying

Usually
impeccably
illuminated,
the

were
startlingly
dark
tonight.

at
night
strategically
placed,
low
level,
noninvasive
lights
that
enabled
staff
members
to
navigate
hallways
and
yet
kept
the
paintings
in
relative
darkness
to
slow
the
fading
effects
of
overexposure
to
light.
Tonight,
the
museum
possessed
an
almost
oppressive
quality.
Long
shadows
encroached
everywhere,
and
the
usually
soaring
vaulted
ceilings
appeared
as
a
low,
black
void.
"This
way,"
Fache
said,
turning
sharply
right
and
