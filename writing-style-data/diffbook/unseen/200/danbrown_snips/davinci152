it
on
the
floor
where
he
died?
Why
this
complicated
word
game?"
"Whatever
my
grandfather
was
trying
to
tell
me,
I
don't
think
he
wanted
anyone
else
to
hear
it.
Not
even
the
police."
Clearly,
her
grandfather
had
done
everything
in
his
power
to
send
a
confidential
transmission
directly
to
her.
He
had
written
it

and
told
her
to
find
Robert
Langdon
a
wise

his
code.
"As

hands.
"Go.
Now."
Sophie
gave
him
a
grateful
smile.
"I'll
see
you
at
the
embassy,
Mr.
Langdon."
Langdon
looked
displeased.
"I'll
meet
you
there
on
one
condition,"
he
replied,
his
voice
stern.
She
paused,
startled.
"What's
that?"
"That
you
stop

Sophie

and
