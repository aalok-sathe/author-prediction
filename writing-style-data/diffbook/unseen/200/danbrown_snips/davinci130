idea,
Silas
thought.
As
he
followed
Sister
Sandrine
down
the
main
aisle,
Silas
was
surprised
by
the
austerity
of
the
sanctuary.
Unlike
Notre
Dame
with
its
colorful
frescoes,
gilded
altar
work,
and
warm
wood,
Saint
Sulpice
was
stark
and
cold,
conveying
an
almost
barren
quality
reminiscent
of
the
ascetic
cathedrals
of
Spain.
The
lack
of
decor
made
the
interior
look
even
more
expansive,
and
as
Silas
gazed
up
into
the
soaring
ribbed
vault
of
the
ceiling,
he
imagined
he
was
standing
beneath
the
hull
of
an
enormous
overturned
ship.
A
fitting
image,
he
thought.
The
brotherhood's
ship
was
about
to
be
capsized
forever.
Feeling
eager
to
get
to
work,
Silas
wished
Sister
Sandrine
would
leave
him.
She
was
a
small
woman
whom
Silas
could
incapacitate
easily,
but
he
had
vowed
not
to
use
force
unless
absolutely
necessary.
She
is
a
woman
of
the
cloth,
and
it
is
not
her
fault
the
brotherhood
chose
her
church
as
a
hiding
place
for
their
keystone.
She
should
not
be
punished
for
the
sins
of
others.
"I
am
embarrassed,
Sister,
that
you
were
awoken
on
my
behalf."
"Not
at
all.
You
are
in
Paris
a
short
time.
You
should
not
miss
Saint
Sulpice.
