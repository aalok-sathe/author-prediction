the
keystone
in
French
churches.
Grail
seekers,
familiar
with
the
Priory's
history
of
cryptic
double
talk,
had
concluded
la
clef
de
voute
was
a
literal
keystone
an
architectural
wedge
an
engraved,
encrypted
stone,
inserted
into
a
vaulted
archway
in
a
church.
Beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
In
architecture,
there
was
no
shortage
of
roses.
Rose
windows.
Rosette
reliefs.
And,
of
course,
an
abundance
of
cinquefoils
the
five
petaled
decorative
flowers
often
found
at
the
top
of
archways,
directly

The
map
to
the
Holy
Grail
was
incorporated
high
in
an
archway
of
some
forgotten
church,
mocking
the
blind
churchgoers
who

It
can't
be
part
of
any
ancient
Grail
legend."
"Actually,"
Langdon
replied,
feeling
a
tingle
of
excitement
ripple
through
him,
"the
keystone
is
believed
to
have
been
created
by
the
Priory
sometime
in
the
past
couple
of
decades."
Sophie's
eyes
flashed
disbelief.
"But
if
this
cryptex
reveals
the
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail,
why
would
my
grandfather
give
it
to
me
?
I
have
no
idea
how
