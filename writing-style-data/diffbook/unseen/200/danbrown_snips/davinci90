the
sum
of
the
two
preceding
terms."
Fache
studied
the
numbers.
Each
term
was
indeed
the
sum
of
the
two
previous,
and
yet
Fache
could
not
imagine
what
the
relevance
of
all
this
was
to
Sauniere's
death.
"Mathematician
Leonardo
Fibonacci
created
this
succession
of
numbers
in
the
thirteenth
century.
Obviously
there
can
be
no
coincidence
that
all
of
the
numbers
Sauniere
wrote
on
the
floor
belong
to
Fibonacci's
famous
sequence."
Fache
stared
at
the
young
woman
for
several
moments.
"Fine,
if
there
is
no
coincidence,
would
you
tell
me
why
Jacques
Sauniere
chose
to
do
this.
What
is
he
saying?
What
does
this
mean?"
She
shrugged.
"Absolutely
nothing.
That's
the
point.
It's
a
simplistic
cryptographic
joke.
Like
taking
the
words
of
a
famous
poem
and
shuffling
them
at
random
to
see
if
anyone
recognizes
what
all
the
words
have
in
common."
Fache
took
a
menacing
step
forward,
placing
his
face
only
inches
from
Sophie's.
"I
certainly
hope
you
have
a
much
more
satisfying
explanation
than
that.
Sophie's
soft
features
grew
surprisingly
stern
as
she
leaned
in.
"Captain,
considering
what
you
have
at
stake
here
tonight,
I
thought
you
might
appreciate
knowing
that
Jacques
Sauniere
might
be
playing
games
with
you.
