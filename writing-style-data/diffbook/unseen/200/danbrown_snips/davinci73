he
heard
a
woman's
voice
chime
out
behind
him.
"Excusez
moi,
messieurs.
Langdon
turned
to
see
a
young
woman
approaching.
She
was
moving
down
the
corridor
toward
them
with
long,
fluid
strides
a
haunting
certainty
to
her
gait.
Dressed
casually
in
a
knee
length,
cream
colored
Irish
sweater
over
black
leggings,
she
was
attractive
and
looked
to
be
about
thirty.
Her

Franco
accent.
"It
is
a
pleasure
to
meet
you."
Langdon
took
her
soft
palm
in
his
and
felt
himself
momentarily
fixed
in
her
strong
gaze.
Her
eyes
were
olive
green
incisive
and
clear.
Fache
drew
a
seething
inhalation,
clearly
preparing
to
launch
into
a
reprimand.
"Captain,"
she
said,
turning
quickly
and
beating
him
to
the
punch,
"please
excuse
the
interruption,
but"
