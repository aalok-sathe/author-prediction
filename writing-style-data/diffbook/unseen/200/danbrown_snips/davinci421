crafted
of
interconnecting
lettered
dials.
The
device
seemed
surprisingly
familiar
to
him.
"Designed
from
Da
Vinci's
diaries,"
Sophie
said.
"My
grandfather
made
them
as
a
hobby."
Of
course,
Teabing
realized.
He
had
seen
the
sketches
and
blueprints.
The
key
to
finding
the
Holy
Grail
lies
inside
this
stone.
Teabing
lifted
the
heavy
cryptex
from
the
box,
holding
it
gently.
Although
he
had
no
idea
how
to
open
the
cylinder,
he
sensed
his
own
destiny
lay
inside.
In
moments
of
failure,
Teabing
had
questioned
whether
his
life's
quest
would
ever
be
rewarded.
Now
those
doubts
were
gone
forever.
He
could
hear
the
ancient
words
the
foundation
of
the
Grail
legend:
Vous
ne
trouvezpas
le
Saint
Graal,
c'est
le
Saint
Graal
qui
vous
trouve.
You
do
not
find
the
Grail,
the
Grail
finds
you.
And
tonight,
incredibly,
the
key
to
finding
the
Holy
Grail
had
walked
right
through
his
front
door.
While
Sophie
and
Teabing
sat
with
the
cryptex
and
talked
about
the
vinegar,
the
dials,
and
what
the
password
might
be,
Langdon
carried
the
rosewood
box
across
the
room
to
a
well
lit
table
to
get
a
better
look
at
it.
Something
Teabing
had
just
said
was
now
running
through
Langdon's
