the
radio.
"He's
running
down
Carrousel.
Wait
he's
picking
up
speed.
He's
moving
too
fast!"
Arriving
at
the
partitions,
Fache
snaked
his
way
through
them,
saw
the
rest
room
door,
and
ran
for
it.
The
walkie
talkie
was
barely
audible
now
over
the
alarm.
"He
must
be
in
a
car!
I
think
he's
in
a
car!
I
can't
Collet's
words
were
swallowed
by
the
alarm
as
Fache
finally
burst
into
the
men's
room
with
his
gun
drawn.
Wincing

area.
The
stalls
were
empty.
The
bathroom

Fache's
eyes
moved
immediately
to
the
shattered

to
the
opening
and
looked

the

was
nowhere
to
be
seen.
Fache
could
not
imagine
anyone
risking
a
stunt
like
this.
Certainly
if
he
had
dropped
that
far,
he
would
be
badly
injured.
The
alarm
cut
off
finally,
and
Collet's
voice
became
audible
again
over
the
walkie
talkie.
"moving
south
faster
crossing
the
Seine
on
Pont
du
Carrousel!"
Fache
turned
to
his
left.
The
only
vehicle
on
Pont
du
Carrousel
was
an
enormous
twin
bed

truck
moving

from
the
