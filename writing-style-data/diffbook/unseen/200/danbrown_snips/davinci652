was
late
afternoon
when
the
London
sun
broke
through
and
the
city
began
to
dry.
Bezu
Fache
felt
weary
as
he
emerged
from
the
interrogation
room
and
hailed
a
cab.
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
had
vociferously
proclaimed
his
innocence,
and
yet
from
his
incoherent
rantings
about
the
Holy
Grail,
secret
documents,
and
mysterious
brotherhoods,
Fache
suspected
the
wily
historian
was
setting
the
stage
for
his
lawyers
to
plead
an
insanity
defense.
Sure,
Fache
thought.
Insane.
Teabing
had
displayed
ingenious
precision
in
formulating
a
plan
that
protected
his
innocence
at
every
turn.
He
had
exploited
both
the
Vatican
and
Opus
Dei,
two
groups
that
turned
out
to
be
completely
innocent.
His
dirty
work
had
been
carried
out
unknowingly
by
a
fanatical
monk
and
a
desperate
bishop.
More
clever
still,
Teabing
had
situated
his
electronic
listening
post
in
the
one
place
a
man
with
polio
could
not
possibly
reach.
The
actual
surveillance
had
been
carried
out
by
his
manservant,
Remy
the
lone
person
privy
to
Teabing's
true
identity
now
conveniently
dead
of
an
allergic
reaction.
Hardly
the
handiwork
of
someone
lacking
mental
faculties,
Fache
thought.
The
information
coming
from
Collet
out
of
Chateau
Villette
suggested
that
Teabing's
cunning
ran
so
deep
that
Fache
