this
hardly
counted
as
drinking
before
noon.
Sitting
in
a
plush
bucket
seat,
he
closed
his
eyes,
trying
to
sort
out
what
was
going
on.
The
Kent
police's
blunder
could
cost
me
dearly.
Everyone
was
now
on
the
lookout
for
a
black
Jaguar
limousine.
Fache's
phone
rang,
and
he
wished
for
a
moment's
peace.
"Alio?"
"I'm
en
route
to
London."
It
was
Bishop
Aringarosa.
"I'll
be
arriving
in
an
hour."
Fache
sat
up.
"I
thought
you
were
going
to
Paris."
"I
am
deeply
concerned.
I
have
changed
my
plans."
"You
should
not
have."
"Do
you
have
Silas?"
"No.
His
captors
eluded
the
local
police
before
I
landed."
Aringarosa's
anger
rang
sharply.
"You
assured
me
you
would
stop
that
plane!"
Fache
lowered
his
voice.
"Bishop,
considering
your
situation,
I
recommend
you
not
test
my
patience
today.
I
will
find
Silas
and
the
others
as
soon
as
possible.
Where
are
you
landing?"
"One
moment."
Aringarosa
covered
the
receiver
and
then
came
back.
"The
pilot
is
trying
to
get
clearance
at
Heathrow.
I'm
his
only
passenger,
but
our
redirect
was
unscheduled."
"Tell
him
to
come
to
Biggin
Hill
Executive
Airport
in
Kent.
I'll
get
him
clearance.
If
I'm
not
here
when
you
land,
