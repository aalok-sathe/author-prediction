until
this
is
over."
"I
do
this
to
protect
your
identity,
Silas's
identity,
and
my
investment."
"Your
investment?"
"Bishop,
if
your
own
eagerness
to
keep
abreast
of
progress
puts
you
in
jail,
then
you
will
be
unable
to
pay
me
my
fee."
The
bishop
smiled.
"A
fine
point.
Our
desires
are
in
accord.
Godspeed."
Twenty
million
euro,
the
bishop
thought,
now
gazing
out
the
plane's
window.
The
sum
was
approximately
the
same
number
of
U.S.
dollars.
A
pittance
for
something
so
powerful.
He
felt
a
renewed
confidence
that
the
Teacher
and
Silas
would
not
fail.
Money
and
faith
were
powerful
motivators.
"Une
plaisanterie
numerique?"
Bezu
Fache
was
livid,
glaring
at
Sophie
Neveu
in
disbelief.
A
numeric
joke?
"Your
professional
assessment
of
Sauniere's
code
is
that
it
is
some
kind
of
mathematical
prank?"
Fache
was
in
utter
incomprehension
of
this
woman's
gall.
Not
only
had
she
just
barged
in
on
Fache
without
permission,
but
she
was
now
trying
to
convince
him
that
Sauniere,
in
his
final
moments
of
life,
had
been
inspired
to
leave
a
mathematical
gag?
"This
code,"
Sophie
explained
in
rapid
French,
"is
simplistic
to
the
point
of
absurdity.
Jacques
Sauniere
must
have
known
we
would
see
through
it
