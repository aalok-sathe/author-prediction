car,
looking
back
at
him.
"Are
you
corning?"
She
was
holding
the
rosewood
box,
which
Captain
Fache
had
returned
to
them.
Inside,
both
cryptexes
had
been
reassembled
and
nested
as
they
had
been
found.
The
papyrus
verse
was
locked
safely
at
its
core
minus
the
shattered
vial
of
vinegar.
Making
their
way
up
the
long
gravel
path,
Langdon
and
Sophie
passed
the
famous
west
wall
of
the
chapel.
Casual
visitors
assumed
this
oddly
protruding
wall
was
a
section
of
the
chapel
that
had
not
been
finished.
The
truth,
Langdon
recalled,
was
far
more
intriguing.
The
west
wall
of
Solomon's
Temple.
The
Knights
Templar
had
designed
Rosslyn
Chapel
as
an
exact
architectural
blueprint
of
Solomon's
Temple
in
Jerusalem
complete
with
a
west
wall,
a
narrow
rectangular
sanctuary,
and
a
subterranean
vault
like
the
Holy
of
Holies,
in
which
the
original
nine
knights
had
first
unearthed
their
priceless
treasure.
Langdon
had
to
admit,
there
existed
an
intriguing
symmetry
in
the
idea
of
the
Templars
building
a
modern
Grail
repository
that
echoed
the
Grail's
original
hiding
place.
Rosslyn
Chapel's
entrance
was
more
modest
than
Langdon
expected.
The
small
wooden
door
had
two
iron
hinges
and
a
simple,
oak
sign.
ROSLIN

ancient
spelling,
