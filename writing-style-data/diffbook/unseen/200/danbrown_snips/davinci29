the
lift,
feeling
the
familiar
tingle
of
adrenaline
as
the
doors
slid
shut.
Two
floors.
Ten
seconds.
"You
and
Mr.
Sauniere,"
Fache
said
as
the
lift
began
to
move,
"you
never
spoke
at
all?
Never
corresponded?
Never
sent
each
other
anything
in
the
mail?"
Another
odd
question.
Langdon
shook
his
head.
"No.
Never."
Fache
cocked
his
head,
as
if
making
a
mental
note
of
that
fact.
Saying
nothing,
he
stared
dead
ahead
at
the
chrome
doors.
As
they
ascended,
Langdon
tried
to
focus
on
anything
other
than
the
four
walls
around

he
saw
the
captain's
tie
clip
a
silver
crucifix
with
thirteen
embedded
pieces
of
black
onyx.
Langdon
found
it
vaguely
surprising.
The
symbol
was
known
as
a
crux
gemmata
a
cross
bearing
thirteen
gems
a
Christian
ideogram
for
Christ
and
His
twelve
apostles.
Somehow
Langdon
had
not
expected
the
captain
of
the
French
police
to
broadcast
his
religion
so
openly.
Then
again,
this
was
France;
Christianity
was
not
a
religion
here
so
much
as
a
birthright.
"It's
a
crux
gemmata"
Fache
said
suddenly.
Startled,
Langdon
glanced
up
to
find
Fache's
eyes
on
him
in
the
reflection.
The
elevator
jolted
to
