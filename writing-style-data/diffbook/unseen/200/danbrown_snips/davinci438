although
considering
Langdon
was
being
charged
with
four
murders,
the
banker's
change
of
heart
seemed
understandable.
"This
monk
is
not
working
alone,
Robert,"
Teabing
said,
"and
until
you
learn
who
is
behind
all
this,
you
both
are
in
danger.
The
good
news,
my
friend,
is
that
you
are
now
in
the
position
of
power.
This
monster
behind
me
holds
that
information,
and
whoever
is
pulling
his
strings
has
got
to
be
quite
nervous
right
now."
Remy
was
picking
up
speed,
getting
comfortable
with
the
trail.
They
splashed
through
some
water,
climbed
a
small
rise,
and
began
descending
again.
"Robert,
could
you
be
so
kind
as
to
hand
me
that
phone?"
Teabing
pointed
to
the
car
phone
on
the
dash.
Langdon
handed
it
back,
and
Teabing
dialed
a
number.
He
waited
for
a
very
long
time
before
someone
answered.
"Richard?
Did
I
wake
you?
Of
course,
I
did.
Silly
question.
I'm
sorry.
I
have
a
small
problem.
I'm
feeling
a
bit
off.
Remy
and
I
need
to
pop
up
to
the
Isles
for
my
treatments.
Well,
right
away,
actually.
Sorry
for
the
short
notice.
Can
you
have
Elizabeth
ready
in
about
twenty
minutes?
I
know,
do
the
best
you
can.
