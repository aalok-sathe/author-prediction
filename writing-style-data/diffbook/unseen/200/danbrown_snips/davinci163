ever
use
P.S.
in
any
other
way?
As
a
monogram,
or
maybe
on
stationery
or
a
personal
item?"
The
question
startled
her.
How
would
Robert
know
that?
Sophie
had
indeed
seen
the
initials
P.S.
once
before,
in
a
kind
of
monogram.
It
was
the
day
before
her
ninth
birthday.
She
was
secretly
combing
the
house,
searching
for
hidden
birthday
presents.
Even
then,
she
could
not
bear
secrets
kept
from
her.
What
did
Grand
pere
get
for
me
this
year?
She
dug
through
cupboards
and
drawers.
Did
he
get
me
the
doll
I
wanted?
Where
would
he
hide
it?
Finding
nothing
in
the
entire
house,
Sophie
mustered
the
courage
to
sneak
into
her
grandfather's
bedroom.
The
room
was
off
limits
to
her,
but
her
grandfather
was
downstairs
asleep
on
the
couch.
I'll
just
take
a
fast
peek!
Tiptoeing
across
the
creaky
wood
floor
to
his
closet,
Sophie
peered
on
the
shelves
behind
his
clothing.
Nothing.
Next
she
looked
under
the
bed.
Still
nothing.
Moving
to
his
bureau,
she
opened
the
drawers
and
one
by
one
began
pawing
carefully
through
them.
There
must
be
something
for
me
here!
As
she
reached
the
bottom
drawer,
she
still
had
not
found
any
hint
of
