Sauniere
would
consider
the
pentacle
a
sign
of
the
female
deity.
The
correlation
between
this
symbol
and
the
sacred
feminine
is
widely
known
by
art
historians
and
symbologists."
"Fine.
And
the
use
of
his
own
blood
as
ink?"
"Obviously
he
had
nothing
else
to
write
with."
Fache
was
silent
a
moment.
"Actually,
I
believe
he
used
blood
such
that
the
police
would
follow
certain
forensic
procedures."
"I'm

Langdon's
eyes

tipped
marker.
"Sauniere
was
holding

said,
leaving
Langdon
and

yards
to
a
portable

with
investigation
tools,
cables,
and
assorted
electronic
gear.
"As
I
told
you,"
he
said,
rummaging
around
the
table,
"we
have
touched
nothing.
Are
you
familiar
with
this
kind
of
pen?"
Langdon
knelt
down
farther
to
see
the
pen's
label.
STYLO
DE
LUMIERE
NOIRE.
He
glanced
up
in
surprise.
The
black
light
pen
or

stylus
was
a
specialized
felt
