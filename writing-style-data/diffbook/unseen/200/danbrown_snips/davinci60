a
debt
women
were
doomed
to
pay
for
eternity.
Sadly,
while
most
of
the
Catholic
Church
was
gradually
moving
in
the
right
direction
with
respect
to
women's
rights,
Opus
Dei
threatened
to
reverse
the
progress.
Even
so,
Sister
Sandrine
had
her
orders.
Swinging
her
legs
off
the
bed,
she
stood

Jacques

seemed
as

message
as
any
Langdon
could
imagine.
The

read:

O,

Oh,
lame

Although
Langdon
had
not
the
slightest
idea
what
it
meant,
he
did
understand
Fache's
instinct
that
the
pentacle
had
something
to
do
with
devil
worship.
O,
Draconian

Sauniere
had
