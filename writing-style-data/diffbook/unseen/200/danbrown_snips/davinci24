666
was
the
number
of
Satan.
Langdon
decided
not
to
bring
it
up.
As
they
dropped
farther
into
the
subterranean
foyer,
the
yawning
space
slowly
emerged
from
the
shadows.
Built
fifty
seven
feet
beneath
ground
level,
the
Louvre's
newly
constructed
70,000
square
foot
lobby
spread
out
like
an
endless
grotto.
Constructed
in
warm
ocher
marble
to
be
compatible
with
the
honey
colored
stone
of
the
Louvre
facade
above,
the
subterranean
hall
was
usually

security
for
the
evening."
Langdon
nodded,
moving
quickly
to
keep
pace
with
Fache.
"How
well
did
you
know
Jacques
Sauniere?"
the
captain
asked.
"Actually,
not
at
all.
We'd
never
met."
Fache
looked
surprised.
"Your
first
meeting
was
to
be
tonight?"
"Yes.
We'd
planned
to
meet

the
American
University
reception
following
my
