that
he
might
be
there.
Have
you
seen
him?"
The
numerary
was
startled.
"Yes,
he
is
here.
Is
something
wrong?"
"He
is
there
now?"
"Yes,
upstairs
praying.
What
is
going
on?"
"Leave
him
precisely
where
he
is,"
the
officer
commanded.
"Don't
say
a
word
to
anyone.
I'm
sending
officers
over
right
away.
St.
James's
Park
is
a
sea
of
green
in
the
middle
of
London,
a
public
park
bordering
the
palaces
of
Westminster,
Buckingham,
and
St.
James's.
Once
enclosed
by
King
Henry
VIII
and
stocked
with
deer
for
the
hunt,
St.
James's
Park
is
now
open
to
the
public.
On
sunny
afternoons,
Londoners
picnic
beneath
the
willows
and
feed
the
pond's
resident
pelicans,
whose
ancestors
were
a
gift
to
Charles
II
from
the
Russian
ambassador.
The
Teacher
saw
no
pelicans
today.
The
stormy
weather
had
brought
instead
seagulls
from
the
ocean.
The
lawns
were
covered
with
them
hundreds
of
white
bodies
all
facing
the
same
direction,
patiently
riding
out
the
damp
wind.
Despite
the
morning
fog,
the
park
afforded
splendid
views
of
the
Houses
of
Parliament
and
Big
Ben.
Gazing
across
the
sloping
lawns,
past
the
duck
pond
and
the
delicate
silhouettes
of
the
weeping
willows,
the
Teacher
could
see
