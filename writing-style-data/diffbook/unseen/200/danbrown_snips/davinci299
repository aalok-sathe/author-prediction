as
your
heart
commands."
When
Aringarosa
described
the
opportunity
that
had
presented
itself,
Silas
knew
it
could
only
be
the
hand
of
God
at
work.
Miraculous
fate!
Aringarosa
put
Silas
in
contact
with
the
man
who
had
proposed
the
plan
a
man
who
called
himself
the
Teacher.
Although
the
Teacher
and
Silas
never
met
face
to
face,
each
time
they
spoke
by
phone,
Silas
was
awed,
both
by
the
profundity
of
the
Teacher's
faith
and
by
the
scope
of
his
power.
The
Teacher
seemed
to
be
a
man
who
knew
all,
a
man
with
eyes
and
ears
in
all
places.
How
the
Teacher
gathered
his
information,
Silas
did
not
know,
but
Aringarosa
had
placed
enormous
trust
in
the
Teacher,
and
he
had
told
Silas
to
do
the
same.
"Do
as
the
Teacher
commands
you,"
the
bishop
told
Silas.
"And
we
will
be
victorious."
Victorious.
Silas
now
gazed
at
the
bare
floor
and
feared
victory
had
eluded
them.
The
Teacher
had
been
tricked.
The
keystone
was
a
devious
dead
end.
And
with
the
deception,
all
hope
had
vanished.
Silas
wished
he
could
call
Bishop
Aringarosa
and
warn
him,
but
the
Teacher
had
removed
all
their
lines
of
direct
communication
tonight.
