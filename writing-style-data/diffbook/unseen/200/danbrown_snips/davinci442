arms
were
wrenched
backward
and
heavily
lashed
to
his
ankles
with
kitchen
twine
and
duct
tape.
Every
bump
in
the
road
sent
pain
shooting
through
his
twisted
shoulders.
At
least
his
captors
had
removed
the
cilice.
Unable
to
inhale
through
the
strip
of
tape
over
his
mouth,
he
could
only
breathe
through
his
nostrils,
which
were
slowly
clogging
up
due
to
the
dusty
rear
cargo
area
into
which
he
had
been
crammed.
He
began
coughing.
"I

on
Silas's
mouth.
In
one
fast
motion,
he
tore
it
off.
Silas
felt
as
if
his
lips
had
just
caught
fire,
but
the
air
pouring
into
his
lungs
was
sent
from
God.
"Whom
do
you
work
for?"
the
British
man
demanded.
"I
do
the
work
of
God,"
Silas
spat

the
pain
in
his

woman
had
kicked
