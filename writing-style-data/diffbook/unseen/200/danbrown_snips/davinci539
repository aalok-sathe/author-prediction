I'll
have
a
car
waiting
for
you.
"Thank
you."
"As
I
expressed
when
we
first
spoke,
Bishop,
you
would
do
well
to
remember
that
you
are
not
the
only
man
on
the
verge
of
losing
everything."
You
seek
the
orb
that
ought
be
on
his
tomb.
Each
of
the
carved
knights
within
the
Temple
Church
lay
on
his
back
with
his
head
resting
on
a
rectangular
stone
pillow.
Sophie
felt
a
chill.
The
poem's
reference
to
an
"orb"
conjured
images
of
the
night
in
her
grandfather's
basement.
Hieros
Gamos.
The
orbs.
Sophie
wondered
if
the
ritual
had
been
performed
in
this
very
sanctuary.
The
circular
room
seemed
custom
built
for
such
a
pagan
rite.
A
stone
pew
encircled
a
bare
expanse
of
floor
in
the
middle.
A
theater
in
the
round,
as
Robert
had
called
it.
She
imagined
this
chamber
at
night,
filled
with
masked
people,
chanting
by
torchlight,
all
witnessing
a
"sacred
communion"
in
the
center
of
the
room.
Forcing
the
image
from
her
mind,
she
advanced
with
Langdon
and
Teabing
toward
the
first
group
of
knights.
Despite
Teabing's
insistence
that
their
investigation
should
be
conducted
meticulously,
Sophie
felt
eager
and
pushed
ahead
of
them,
making
a
cursory
walk
