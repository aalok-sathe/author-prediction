reach
because
it
was
chained
to
the
U.S.
Embassy.
Not
tonight,
Fache
told
himself.
There
is
far
too
much
at
stake.
By
the
time
Robert
Langdon
hung
up
the
phone,
he
looked
ill.
"Is
everything
all
right?"
Fache
asked.
Weakly,
Langdon
shook
his
head.
Bad
news
from
home,
Fache
sensed,
noticing
Langdon
was
sweating
slightly
as
Fache
took
back
his
cell
phone.
"An
accident,"
Langdon
stammered,
looking
at
Fache
with
a
strange
expression.
"A
friend"
He
hesitated.
"I'll
need
to
fly
home
first
thing
in
the
morning."
Fache
had
no
doubt
the
shock
on
Langdon's
face
was
genuine,
and
yet
he
sensed
another
emotion
there
too,
as
if
a
distant
fear
were
suddenly
simmering
in
the
American's
eyes.
"I'm
sorry
to
hear
that,"
Fache
said,
watching
Langdon
closely.
"Would
you
like
to
sit
down?"
He
motioned
toward
one
of
the
viewing
benches
in
the
gallery.
Langdon
nodded
absently
and
took
a
few
steps
toward
the
bench.
He
paused,
looking
more
confused
with
every
moment.
"Actually,
I
think
I'd
like
to
use
the
rest
room."
Fache
frowned
inwardly
at
the
delay.
"The
rest
room.
Of
course.
Let's
take
a
break
for
a
few
minutes."
He
motioned
back
down
the
long
hallway
