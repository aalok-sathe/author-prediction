had
been
on
his
mind.
"I
think
I
know
part
of
the
reason
why
your
grandfather
conspired
to
put
us
together.
I
think
there's
something
he
wanted
me
to
explain
to
you."
"The
history
of
the
Holy
Grail
and
Mary
Magdalene
isn't
enough?"
Langdon
felt
uncertain
how
to
proceed.
"The
rift
between
you.
The

to
him
in

in

And

upset
you
enough
that

to
him
since.
I
know
a
fair
amount
about
secret
societies.
It
doesn't
take
the
brains
of
Da

to
guess
what
you
saw."
Sophie
stared.
"Was
it
in
the
spring?"
Langdon
asked.
"Sometime
around
the
equinox?
Mid
March?"
Sophie
looked
out
the
window.
"I
was
on
spring

from
university.
I
came
