had
been
wrong
on
every
account.
Nestled
snugly
inside
the
box's
heavily
padded
interior
of
crimson
silk
lay
an
object
Langdon
could
not
even
begin
to
comprehend.
Crafted
of
polished
white
marble,
it
was
a
stone
cylinder
approximately
the
dimensions
of
a
tennis
ball
can.
More
complicated
than
a
simple
column
of
stone,
however,
the
cylinder
appeared
to
have
been
assembled
in
many
pieces.
Six
doughnutsized
disks
of
marble
had
been
stacked
and
affixed
to
one
another
within
a
delicate
brass
framework.
It
looked
like
some
kind
of
tubular,
multiwheeled
kaleidoscope.
Each
end
of
the
cylinder
was
affixed
with
an
end

making
it
impossible
to
see

Langdon
assumed
the
cylinder
was
hollow.
As
mystifying
as
the
construction
of
the
cylinder
was,
however,
it
was
the
engravings
around
the
tube's
circumference
that
drew
Langdon's
primary
focus.
Each
of
the
six
disks
had
been
carefully
carved
with
the
same
unlikely
series
of
letters
the
entire
alphabet.
The
lettered
cylinder
reminded
Langdon
of
one
of
his
childhood
toys
a
rod
threaded
with
lettered
tumblers
that
could
be
rotated
to
spell
different
words.
"Amazing,
isn't
it?"
Sophie
whispered.
Langdon
glanced
up.
"I
don't
know.
