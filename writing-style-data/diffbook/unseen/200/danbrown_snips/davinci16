didn't
slow.
The
agent
gunned
the
sedan
across
the
junction
and
sped
onto
a
wooded
section
of
Rue
Castiglione,
which
served
as
the
northern
entrance
to
the
famed
Tuileries
Gardens
Paris's
own
version
of
Central
Park.
Most
tourists
mistranslated
Jardins
des
Tuileries
as
relating
to
the
thousands
of
tulips
that
bloomed
here,
but
Tuileries
was
actually
a
literal
reference
to
something
far
less
romantic.
This
park
had
once
been
an
enormous,
polluted
excavation
pit
from
which
Parisian
contractors
mined
clay
to
manufacture
the
city's
famous
red
roofing
tiles
or
tuiles.
As
they
entered
the
deserted
park,
the
agent
reached
under
the
dash
and
turned
off
the
blaring
siren.
Langdon
exhaled,
savoring
the
sudden
quiet.
Outside
the
car,
the
pale
wash
of
halogen
headlights
skimmed
over
the
crushed
gravel
parkway,
the
rugged
whir
of
the
tires
intoning
a
hypnotic
rhythm.
Langdon
had
always
considered
the
Tuileries
to
be
sacred
ground.
These
were
the
gardens
in
which
Claude
Monet
had
experimented
with
form
and
color,
and
literally
inspired
the
birth
of
the
Impressionist
movement.
Tonight,
however,
this
place
held
a
strange
aura
of
foreboding.
The
Citroen
swerved
left
now,
angling
west
down
the
park's
central
boulevard.
Curling
around
a
circular
pond,
the
