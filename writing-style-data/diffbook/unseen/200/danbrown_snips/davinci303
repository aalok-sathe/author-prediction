hell
is
it?"
Now
there
was
a
glint
in
Sophie's
eye.
"My
grandfather
used
to
craft
these
as
a
hobby.
They
were
invented
by
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
Even
in
the
diffuse
light,
Sophie
could
see
Langdon'
s
surprise.
"Da
Vinci?"
he
muttered,
looking
again
at
the
canister.
"Yes.
It's
called
a
cryptex.
According
to
my
grandfather,
the
blueprints
come
from
one
of
Da
Vinci's
secret
diaries."
"What
is
it
for?"
Considering
tonight's
events,
Sophie
knew
the
answer
might
have
some
interesting
implications.
"It's
a
vault,"
she
said.
"For
storing
secret
information."
Langdon's
eyes
widened
further.
Sophie
explained
that
creating
models
of
Da
Vinci's
inventions
was
one
of
her
grandfather's
best
loved
hobbies.
A
talented
craftsman
who
spent
hours
in
his
wood
and
metal
shop,
Jacques
Sauniere
enjoyed
imitating
master
craftsmen
Faberge,
assorted
cloisonne
artisans,
and
the
less
artistic,
but
far
more
practical,
Leonardo
da
Vinci.
Even
a
cursory
glance
through
Da
Vinci's
journals
revealed
why
the
luminary
was
as
notorious
for
his
lack
of
follow
through
as
he
was
famous
for
his
brilliance.
Da
Vinci
had
drawn
up
blueprints
for
hundreds
of
inventions
he
had
never
built.
One
of
Jacques
Sauniere's
favorite
pastimes
was
bringing
Da
Vinci's
more
obscure
brainstorms
