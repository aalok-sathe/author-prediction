sense
at
all.
"Nobody's
here!"
The
entire
first
floor
looked
deserted.
Where
are
all
the
people
?
Heart
racing,
Sophie
ran
to
the
woodshed
and
got
the
spare
key
her
grandfather
kept
hidden
under
the
kindling
box.
She
ran
to
the
front
door
and
let
herself

As
she
stepped
into
the
deserted
foyer,
the
control

Sophie
heard
it.
Muffled
voices.
And
they
seemed
to
be
coming
from
underneath
her.
Sophie
could
not
imagine.
Crouching,
she
put
her
ear
to
the
floor
and
listened.
Yes,
the
sound
was
definitely
coming
from
below.
The
voices
seemed
to
be
singing,
or
chanting?
She
was
frightened.
Almost
more
eerie
than
the
sound
itself
was
the
realization
that
this
house
did
not
even
have
a
