Holy
men
who
had
once
required
sexual
union
with
their
female
counterparts
to
commune
with
God
now
feared
their
natural
sexual
urges
as
the
work
of
the
devil,
collaborating
with
his
favorite
accomplice
woman.
Not
even
the
feminine
association
with
the
left
hand
side
could
escape
the
Church's
defamation.
In
France
and
Italy,
the
words
for
"left"
gauche
and
sinistra
came
to
have
deeply
negative
overtones,
while
their
right

had
become
a
man's

and
the
gods
of
destruction
and
war
were
taking
their
toll.
The
male
ego
had
spent
two
millennia
running
unchecked
by
its
female
counterpart.
The
Priory
of
Sion
believed
that
it
was
this
obliteration
of
the
sacred
feminine
in
modern
life
that
had
caused
what
the
Hopi
Native
Americans
called
koyanisquatsi
"life
out
of
balance"
an
unstable
situation
marked
by
testosterone
fueled
wars,
a
plethora
of
misogynistic
societies,
and
a
growing
disrespect
for
Mother
Earth.
"Robert!"
Sophie
said,
her

yanking

back.
"Someone's
