"That's
strange,
because
my
grandfather
always
told
me
the
Rose
meant
secrecy.
He
used
to
hang
a
rose
on
his
office
door
at
home
when
he
was
having
a
confidential
phone
call
and
didn't
want
me
to
disturb
him.
He
encouraged
me
to
do
the
same."
Sweetie,
her
grandfather
said,
rather
than
lock
each
other
out,
we
can
each
hang
a
rose
lafleur
des
secrets
on
our
door
when
we

learn
to
respect
and
trust
each
other.
Hanging
a
rose
is
an
ancient
Roman
custom.
"Sub

"
Langdon
said.
"The
Romans
hung
a
rose
over

meeting
was
confidential.
Attendees
understood
that
whatever
was
said
under
the
rose
or
sub
rosa
had
to
remain
a
secret."
Langdon
quickly
explained
that
the
Rose's
overtone
of
secrecy
was
not
the
only
reason
the
Priory
used
it
as
a
symbol
for
the
Grail.
Rosa
rugosa,
one
of
the
oldest
species
of
rose,
had
five
petals
and
pentagonal
symmetry,
just
like
the
guiding
star
of
Venus,
giving
the
Rose
strong
iconographic
ties
to
womanhood.
In
addition,
the
Rose
had
close
ties
to
the
concept
of
"true
direction"
and
navigating
one's
way.
