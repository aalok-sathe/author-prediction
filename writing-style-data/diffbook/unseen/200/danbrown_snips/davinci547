from
her
chest,
down
to
her
waist,
slipping
it
inside
her
deep
sweater
pockets,
searching.
He
could
smell
the
soft
fragrance
of
her
hair
through
his
own
alcohol
laced
breath.
"Where
is
it?"
he
whispered.
The
keystone
was
in
her
sweater
pocket
earlier.
So
where
is
it
now?
"It's
over
here,"
Langdon's
deep
voice
resonated
from
across
the
room.
Silas
turned
to
see
Langdon
holding
the
black
cryptex
before
him,
waving
it
back
and
forth
like
a
matador
tempting
a
dumb
animal.
"Set
it
down,"
Silas
demanded.
"Let
Sophie
and
Leigh
leave
the
church,"
Langdon
replied.
"You
and
I
can
settle
this."
Silas
pushed
Sophie
away
from
him
and
aimed
the
gun
at
Langdon,
moving
toward
him.
"Not
a
step
closer,"
Langdon
said.
"Not
until
they
leave
the
building."
"You
are
in
no
position
to
make
demands."
"I
disagree."
Langdon
raised
the
cryptex
high
over
his
head.
"I
will
not
hesitate
to
smash
this
on
the
floor
and
break
the
vial
inside."
Although
Silas
sneered
outwardly
at
the
threat,
he
felt
a
flash
of
fear.
This
was
unexpected.
He
aimed
the
gun
at
Langdon's
head
and
kept
his
voice
as
steady
as
his
hand.
"You
would
never
break
the
keystone.
