was
moaning
now,
struggling
against
his
trusses.
Suddenly,
he
began
kicking
wildly.
Teabing
spun
around
and
aimed
the
pistol
over
the
seat.
"I
can't
imagine
your
complaint,
sir.
You
trespassed
in
my
home
and
planted
a
nasty
welt
on
the
skull
of
a
dear
friend.
I
would
be
well
within
my
rights
to
shoot
you
right
now
and
leave
you
to
rot
in
the
woods."
The
monk
fell
silent.
"Are
you

we
should
have
brought
him?"
Langdon
asked.
"Bloody

my
home."

"The

but
I
am
surprised
that
this
Opus
Dei
character
found
you.
From
all
you've
told
me,
I
can't
imagine
how
this
man
could
have
tailed
you
to
my
home
unless
he
had
a
contact
either
within
the
Judicial
Police
or
within
the
Zurich
Depository."
Langdon
considered
it.
Bezu
Fache
certainly
seemed
intent
on
finding
a
scapegoat
for
tonight's
murders.
And
Vernet
had
turned
on
them
rather
suddenly,
