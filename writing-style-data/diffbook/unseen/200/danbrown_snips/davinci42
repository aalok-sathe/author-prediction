beneath
the
security
gate,
Robert
Langdon
now
stood
just
inside
the
entrance
to
the
Grand
Gallery.
He
was
staring
into
the
mouth
of
a
long,
deep
canyon.
On
either
side
of
the
gallery,
stark
walls
rose
thirty
feet,
evaporating
into
the
darkness
above.
The
reddish
glow
of
the
service
lighting
sifted
upward,
casting
an
unnatural
smolder
across
a
staggering
collection
of
Da
Vincis,
Titians,
and
Caravaggios
that
hung
suspended
from
ceiling
cables.
Still
lifes,
religious
scenes,
and
landscapes
accompanied
portraits
of
nobility
and
politicians.
Although
the
Grand
Gallery
housed
the
Louvre's
most
famous
Italian
art,
many
visitors
felt
the
wing's
most
stunning
offering
was
actually
its
famous
parquet
floor.
Laid
out
in
a
dazzling
geometric
design
of
diagonal
oak
slats,
the
floor
produced
an
ephemeral
optical
illusion
a
multi
dimensional
network
that
gave
visitors
the
sense
they
were
floating
through
the
gallery
on
a
surface
that
changed
with
every
step.
As
Langdon's
gaze
began
to
trace
the
inlay,
his
eyes
stopped
short
on
an
unexpected
object
lying
on
the
floor
just
a
few
yards
to
his
left,
surrounded
by
police
tape.
He
spun
toward
Fache.
"Is
that
a
Caravaggio
on
the
floor?"
Fache
nodded
without
even
looking.
The
painting,
Langdon
