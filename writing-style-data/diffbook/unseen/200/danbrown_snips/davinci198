time
comes,
the
key
will
be
yours.
A
tightness
gripped
her
throat
as
she
realized
that
her
grandfather,
even
in
death,
had
kept
his
promise.
This
key
opens
a
box,
his
voice
was
saying,
where
I
keep
many
secrets.
Sophie
now
realized
that
the
entire
purpose
of
tonight's
word
game
had
been
this
key.
Her
grandfather
had
it
with
him
when
he
was
killed.
Not
wanting
it
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
police,
he
hid
it
behind
this
painting.
Then
he
devised
an
ingenious
treasure
hunt
to
ensure
only
Sophie
would
find
it.
"Au
secours!"
the
guard's
voice
yelled.
Sophie
snatched
the
key
from
behind
the
painting
and
slipped
it
deep
in
her
pocket
along
with
the
UV
penlight.
Peering
out
from
behind
the
canvas,
she
could
see
the
guard
was
still
trying
desperately
to
raise
someone
on
the
walkie
talkie.
He
was
backing
toward
the
entrance,
still
aiming
the
gun
firmly
at
Langdon.
"Au
secours!"
he
shouted
again
into
his
radio.
Static.
He
can
't
transmit,
Sophie
realized,
recalling
that
tourists
with
cell
phones
often
got
frustrated
in
here
when
they
tried
to
call
home
to
brag
about
seeing
the
Mona
Lisa.
The
extra
surveillance
wiring
in
