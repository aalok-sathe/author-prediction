words
crackled
through
the
intercom
on
the
wall,
and
Sophie
jumped.
"If
you
could
join
me
in
the
kitchen
a
moment?"
Teabing
scowled
at
the
ill
timed
intrusion.
He
went
over
to
the
intercom
and
pressed
the
button.
"Remy,
as
you
know,
I
am
busy
with
my
guests.
If
we
need
anything
else
from
the
kitchen
tonight,
we
will
help
ourselves.
Thank
you
and
good
night."
"A
word
with
you
before
I
retire,
sir.
If
you
would."
Teabing
grunted
and
pressed
the
button.
"Make
it
quick,
Remy."
"It
is
a
household
matter,
sir,
hardly
fare
for
guests
to
endure."
Teabing
looked
incredulous.
"And
it
cannot
wait
until
morning?"
"No,
sir.
My
question
won't
take
a
minute."
Teabing
rolled
his
eyes
and
looked
at
Langdon
and
Sophie.
"Sometimes
I
wonder
who
is
serving
whom?"
He
pressed
the
button
again.
"I'll
be
right
there,
Remy.
Can
I
bring
you
anything
when
I
come?"
"Only
freedom
from
oppression,
sir."
"Remy,
you
realize
your
steak
au
poivre
is
the
only
reason
you
still
work
for
me."
"So
you
tell
me,
sir.
So
you
tell
me."
Princess
Sophie.
Sophie
felt
hollow
as
she
listened
to
the
clicking
of
Teabing's
crutches
fade
down
the
hallway.
Numb,
