the
Grail
should
be
unveiled.
In
fact
the
Priory
has
always
maintained
that
the
Grail
should
never
be
unveiled."
"Never?"
Langdon
was
stunned.
"It
is
the
mystery
and
wonderment
that
serve
our
souls,
not
the
Grail
itself.
The
beauty
of
the
Grail
lies
in
her
ethereal
nature."
Marie
Chauvel
gazed
up
at
Rosslyn
now.
"For
some,
the
Grail
is
a
chalice
that
will
bring
them
everlasting
life.
For
others,
it
is
the
quest
for
lost
documents
and
secret
history.
And
for
most,
I
suspect
the
Holy
Grail
is
simply
a
grand
idea
a
glorious
unattainable
treasure
that
somehow,
even
in
today's
world
of
chaos,
inspires
us."
"But
if
the
Sangreal
documents
remain
hidden,
the
story
of
Mary
Magdalene
will
be
lost
forever,"
Langdon
said.
"Will
it?
Look
around
you.
Her
story
is
being
told
in
art,
music,
and
books.
More
so
every
day.
The
pendulum
is
swinging.
We
are
starting
to
sense
the
dangers
of
our
history
and
of
our
destructive
paths.
We
are
beginning
to
sense
the
need
to
restore
the
sacred
feminine."
She
paused.
"You
mentioned
you
are
writing
a
manuscript
about
the
symbols
of
the
sacred
feminine,
are
you
not?"
"I
am."
She
smiled.
"Finish
it,
Mr.
