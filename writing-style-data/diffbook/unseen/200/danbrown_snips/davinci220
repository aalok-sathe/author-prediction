of
Paris?"
"Too
obvious.
Fache
will
check
with
them."
"You
must
know
people.
You
live
here."
"Fache
will
run
my
phone
and
e
mail
records,
talk
to
my
coworkers.
My
contacts
are
compromised,
and
finding
a
hotel
is
no
good
because
they
all
require
identification.
Langdon
wondered
again
if
he
might
have
been
better
off
taking
his
chances
letting
Fache
arrest
him
at
the
Louvre.
"Let's
call
the
embassy.
I
can
explain
the
situation
and
have
the
embassy
send
someone
to
meet
us
somewhere."
"Meet
us?"
Sophie
turned
and
stared
at
him
as
if
he
were
crazy.
"Robert,
you're
dreaming.
Your
embassy
has
no
jurisdiction
except
on
their
own
property.
Sending
someone
to
retrieve
us
would
be
considered
aiding
a
fugitive
of
the
French
government.
It
won't
happen.
If
you
walk
into
your
embassy
and
request
temporary
asylum,
that's
one
thing,
but
asking
them
to
take
action
against
French
law
enforcement
in
the
field?"
She
shook
her
head.
"Call
your
embassy
right
now,
and
they
are
going
to
tell
you
to
avoid
further
damage
and
turn
yourself
over
to
Fache.
Then
they'll
promise
to
pursue
diplomatic
channels
to
get
you
a
fair
trial.

She
gazed
up
the
line
