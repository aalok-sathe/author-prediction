although
he
was
seldom
given
credit.
Sophie's
university
instructors,
while
presenting
computer
encryption
methods
for
securing
data,
praised
modern
cryptologists
like
Zimmerman
and
Schneier
but
failed
to
mention
that
it
was
Leonardo
who
had
invented
one
of
the
first
rudimentary
forms
of
public
key
encryption
centuries
ago.
Sophie's
grandfather,
of
course,
had
been
the
one
to
tell
her
all
about
that.
As
their
armored
truck
roared
down
the
highway,
Sophie
explained
to
Langdon
that
the
cryptex
had
been
Da
Vinci's
solution
to
the
dilemma
of
sending
secure
messages
over
long
distances.
In
an
era
without
telephones
or
e
mail,
anyone
wanting
to
convey
private
information
to
someone
far
away
had
no
option
but
to
write
it
down
and
then
trust
a
messenger
to
carry
the
letter.
Unfortunately,
if
a
messenger
suspected
the
letter
might
contain
valuable
information,
he
could
make
far
more
money
selling
the
information
to
adversaries
than
he
could
delivering
the
letter
properly.
Many
great
minds
in
history
had
invented
cryptologic
solutions
to
the
challenge
of
data
protection:
Julius
Caesar
devised
a
code
writing
scheme
called
the
Caesar
Box;
Mary,
Queen
of
Scots
created
a
transposition
cipher
and
sent
secret
communiques
from
prison;
and
the
brilliant
Arab
scientist
