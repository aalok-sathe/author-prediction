grandfather
died
trying
to
protect?
He
trusted
you,
Robert.
trusted
you!"
Langdon's
blue
eyes
showed
panic
now,
and
Teabing
could
not
help
but
smile
to
see
the
two
of
them
working
against
one
another.
Langdon's
attempts
to
be
gallant
were
more
pathetic
than
anything.
On
the
verge
of
unveiling
one
of
history's
greatest
secrets,
and
he
troubles
himself
with
a
woman
who
has
proven
herself
unworthy
of
the
quest.
"Sophie,"
Langdon
pleaded.
"Please
you
must
leave."
She
shook
her
head.
"Not
unless
you
either
hand
me
the
cryptex
or
smash
it
on
the
floor."
"What?"
Langdon
gasped.
"Robert,
my
grandfather
would
prefer
his
secret
lost
forever
than
see
it
in
the
hands
of
his
murderer."
Sophie's
eyes
looked
as
if
they
would
well
with
tears,
but
they
did
not.
She
stared
directly
back
at
Teabing.
"Shoot
me
if
you
have
to.
I
am
not
leaving
my
grandfather's
legacy
in
your
hands."
Very
well.
Teabing
aimed
the
weapon.
"No!"
Langdon
shouted,
raising
his
arm
and
suspending
the
cryptex
precariously
over
the
hard
stone
floor.
"Leigh,
if
you
even
think
about
it,
I
will
drop
this."
Teabing
laughed.
"That
bluff
worked
on
Remy.
Not
on
me.
I
know
you
better
than
that."
