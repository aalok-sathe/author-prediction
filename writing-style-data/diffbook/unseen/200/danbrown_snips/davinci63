why?"
Langdon
knew
Sauniere
spoke
impeccable
English,
and
yet
the
reason
he
had
chosen
English
as
the
language
in
which
to
write
his
final
words
escaped
Langdon.
He
shrugged.
Fache
motioned
back
to
the
pentacle
on
Sauniere's
abdomen.
"Nothing
to
do
with
devil
worship?
Are
you
still
certain?"
Langdon
was
certain
of
nothing
anymore.
"The
symbology
and

don't
seem
to
coincide.
I'm
sorry

can't
be

more
help."
"Perhaps
this
will
clarify."
Fache
backed

now?"
To

Sauniere
had
apparently
lay

arcs,
essentially
inscribing
himself
inside
a
circle.
In
a
flash,
the
meaning
became
clear.
"The
Vitruvian
Man,
"
Langdon
gasped.
Sauniere
had
created
a
life
sized
replica
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci's
most
famous
sketch.
Considered
the
most
anatomically
correct
drawing
of
its
day,
Da
Vinci's
The
Vitruvian
Man
had
become
a
modern
day
icon
of
culture,
appearing
on
posters,
mouse
pads,
and
T
shirts
around
the
world.
The
celebrated
sketch
consisted
of
a
perfect
circle
in
which
