without
documentation,
accompanying
a
wanted
man,
and
transporting
a
bound
hostage.
If
a
"line
of
reason"
had
ever
existed,
she
had
just
crossed
it.
At
almost
the
speed
of
sound.
Sophie
was
seated
with
Langdon
and
Teabing
near
the
front
of
the
cabin
the
Fan
Jet
Executive
Elite
Design,
according
to
the
gold
medallion
on
the
door.
Their
plush
swivel
chairs
were
bolted
to
tracks
on
the
floor
and
could
be
repositioned
and
locked
around
a
rectangular
hardwood
table.
A
mini
boardroom.
The
dignified
surroundings,
however,
did
little
to
camouflage
the
less
than
dignified
state
of
affairs
in
the
rear
of
the
plane
where,
in
a
separate
seating
area
near
the
rest
room,
Teabing's
manservant
Remy
sat
with
the
pistol
in
hand,
begrudgingly
carrying
out
Teabing's
orders
to
stand
guard
over
the
bloody
monk
who
lay
trussed
at
his
feet
like
a
piece
of
luggage.
"Before
we
turn
our
attention
to
the
keystone,"
Teabing
said,
"I
was
wondering
if
you
would
permit
me
a
few
words."
He
sounded
apprehensive,
like
a
father
about
to
give
the
birds
and
the
bees
lecture
to
his
children.
"My
friends,
I
realize
I
am
but
a
guest
on
this
journey,
and
I
am
honored
