to
frustrate
the
curious
and
bring
a
smirk
to
the
face
of
his
knowing
Mona
Lisa.
"Is
it
possible,"
Sophie
asked,
drawing
Langdon
back,
"that
the
key
you're
holding
unlocks
the
hiding
place
of
the
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon's
laugh
sounded
forced,
even
to
him.
"I
really
can't
imagine.
Besides,
the
Grail
is
believed
to
be
hidden
in
the
United
Kingdom
somewhere,
not
France."
He
gave
her
the
quick
history.
"But
the
Grail
seems
the
only
rational
conclusion,"
she
insisted.
"We
have
an
extremely

and

Rumors
existed
that
the
Priory
had
vowed
someday
to
bring
the
Grail
back
to
France
to
a
final
resting
place,
but
certainly
no
historical
evidence
existed
to
suggest
that
this
indeed
had
happened.
Even
if
the
Priory
had
managed
to
bring
the
Grail
back
to
France,
the
address
24
Rue
Haxo
near
a
tennis
stadium
hardly
sounded
like
a
noble
final
resting
place.
"Sophie,
I
