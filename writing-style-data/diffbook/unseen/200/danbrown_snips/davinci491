wisdom.'
"Yes?"
Teabing
winked.
"In
ancient
Greek,
wisdom
is
spelled
S
O
F
I
A."
Sophie
felt
a
wild
excitement
as
she
cradled
the
cryptex
and
began
dialing
in
the
letters.
An
ancient
word
of
wisdom
frees
this
scroll.
Langdon
and
Teabing
seemed
to
have
stopped
breathing
as
they
looked
on.
S
OF
"Carefully,"
Teabing
urged.
"Ever
so
carefully."
I
A.
Sophie
aligned
the
final
dial.
"Okay,"
she
whispered,
glancing
up
at
the
others.
"I'm
going
to
pull
it
apart."
"Remember
the
vinegar,"
Langdon
whispered
with
fearful
exhilaration.
"Be
careful."
Sophie
knew
that
if
this
cryptex
were
like
those
she
had
opened
in
her
youth,
all
she
would
need
to
do
is
grip
the
cylinder
at
both
ends,
just
beyond
the
dials,
and
pull,
applying
slow,
steady
pressure
in
opposite
directions.
If
the
dials
were
properly
aligned
with
the
password,
then
one
of
the
ends
would
slide
off,
much
like
a
lens
cap,
and
she
could
reach
inside
and
remove
the
rolled
papyrus
document,
which
would
be
wrapped
around
the
vial
of
vinegar.
However,
if
the
password
they
had
entered
were
incorrect,
Sophie's
outward
force
on
the
ends
would
be
transferred
to
a
hinged
lever
inside,
which
would
pivot
downward
