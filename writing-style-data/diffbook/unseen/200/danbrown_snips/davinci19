driver
ignored
the
signs
prohibiting
auto
traffic
on
the
plaza,
revved
the
engine,
and
gunned
the
Citroen
up
over
the
curb.
The
Louvre's
main
entrance
was
visible
now,
rising
boldly
in
the
distance,
encircled
by
seven
triangular
pools
from
which
spouted
illuminated
fountains.
La
Pyramide.
The
new
entrance
to
the
Paris
Louvre
had
become
almost
as
famous
as
the
museum
itself.
The
controversial,
neomodern
glass
pyramid
designed
by
Chinese
born
American
architect
I.
M.
Pei
still
evoked
scorn
from
traditionalists
who
felt
it
destroyed
the
dignity
of
the
Renaissance
courtyard.
Goethe
had
described
architecture
as
frozen
music,
and
Pei's
critics
described
this
pyramid
as
fingernails
on
a
chalkboard.
Progressive
admirers,
though,
hailed
Pei's
seventy
one
foot
tall
transparent
pyramid
as
a
dazzling
synergy
of
ancient
structure
and
modern
method
a
symbolic
link
between
the
old
and
new
helping
usher
the
Louvre
into
the
next
millennium.
"Do
you
like
our
pyramid?"
the
agent
asked.
Langdon
frowned.
The
French,
it
seemed,
loved
to
ask
Americans
this.
It
was
a
loaded
question,
of
course.
Admitting
you
liked
the
pyramid
made
you
a
tasteless
American,
and
expressing
dislike
was
an
insult
to
the
French.
"Mitterrand
was
a
bold
man,"
Langdon
replied,
splitting
the
difference.
