now.
"If
you
don't
take
it
soon,
I'm
afraid
I
shall
drop
it!"
He
swayed
perilously.
Silas
stepped
quickly
forward
to
take
the
stone,
and
as
he
did,
the
man
on
crutches
lost
his
balance.
The
crutch
slid
out
from
under
him,
and
he
began
to
topple
sideways
to
his
right.
No!
Silas
lunged
to
save
the
stone,
lowering
his
weapon
in
the
process.
But
the
keystone
was
moving
away
from
him

As
the
man

crushing
the
barbs
into
his
already
raw
flesh.
Buckling,
Silas
crumpled
to
his
knees,
causing
the
belt
to
cut
deeper
still.
The
pistol
discharged
with
a
deafening
roar,
the
bullet
burying
itself
harmlessly
in
the
floorboards
as
Silas
fell.
Before
he
could
raise
the
gun
and
fire
again,
the
woman's
foot
caught
him
square

the
jaw.
