shouting.
Moments
later,
Vernet
felt
a
cloud
of
dirt
and
exhaust
billowing
over
him.
He
heard
the
crunching
of
tires
on
gravel
and
sat
up
just
in
time
to
see
the
truck's
wide
wheelbase
fail
to
navigate
a
turn.
There
was
a
crash
as
the
front
bumper
clipped
a
tree.
The
engine
roared,
and
the
tree
bent.
Finally,
it
was
the
bumper
that
gave,
tearing
half
off.
The
armored
car
lurched
away,
its
front
bumper

When
the
truck
reached
the
paved

a
shower

was
gone.
The
unmarked
Fiat
sedan
departing
Castel
Gandolfo
snaked
downward
through
the
Alban
Hills
into
the
valley
below.
In
the
back
seat,
Bishop
Aringarosa
smiled,
feeling
the
weight
of
the
bearer
bonds
in
the
briefcase
on
his
lap
and
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
he
and
the
Teacher
could
make
the
exchange.
Twenty
million
euro.
The
sum
would
buy
Aringarosa
power
far
more
valuable
than
that.
As
