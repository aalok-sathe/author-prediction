Andre
would
have
done
anything
to
honor
Jacques's
requests
for
the
care
of
this
box."
Including
shooting
me,
Langdon
recalled,
deciding
not
to
mention
that
he
had
probably
broken
the
poor
man's
nose.
Thinking
of
Paris,
Langdon
flashed
on
the
three
senechaux
who
had
been
killed
the
night
before.
"And
the
Priory?
What
happens
now?"
"The
wheels
are
already
in

Mr.
Langdon.
The
brotherhood
has
endured
for
centuries,
and
it
will
endure
this.
There
are
always
those
waiting
to
move
up
and
rebuild."
All

had
suspected
that

After

the
Priory
had
always
had
women
members.
Four
Grand
Masters
had
been
women.
The
senechaux
were
traditionally
men

guardians
and
yet
women
held
far
more
honored
status
within
the
Priory
and
could
ascend
to
the
highest
post
from
virtually
any
rank.
Langdon
thought
of
Leigh
Teabing
and
Westminster
Abbey.
It
seemed
a
lifetime
ago.
"Was
the
Church
pressuring
your
husband
not
to
release
the
Sangreal
documents
at
the
End
of
Days?"
"Heavens
no.
The
End
of
Days
is
a
legend
of
paranoid
minds.
There
is
nothing
in
the
Priory
doctrine
that
identifies
a
date
