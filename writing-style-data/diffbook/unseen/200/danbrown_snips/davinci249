symbologic
angle.
The
iconographic
evidence
I'm
finding
to
support
the
theory
is,
well,
staggeringly
persuasive."
Faukman
was
still
staring
at
the
list.
"My
God,
one
of
these
books
was
written
by
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
a
British
Royal
Historian."
"Teabing
has
spent
much
of
his
life
studying
the
Holy
Grail.
I've
met
with
him.
He
was
actually
a
big
part
of
my
inspiration.
He's
a
believer,
Jonas,
along
with
all
of
the
others
on
that
list."
"You're
telling
me
all
of
these
historians
actually
believe"
Faukman
swallowed,
apparently
unable
to
say
the
words.
Langdon
grinned
again.
"The
Holy
Grail
is
arguably
the
most
sought
after
treasure
in
human
history.
The
Grail
has
spawned
legends,
wars,
and
lifelong
quests.
Does
it
make
sense
that
it
is
merely
a
cup?
If
so,
then
certainly
other
relics
should
generate
similar
or
greater
interest
the
Crown
of
Thorns,
the
True
Cross
of
the
Crucifixion,
the
Titulus
and
yet,
they
do
not.
Throughout
history,
the
Holy
Grail
has
been
the
most
special."
Langdon
grinned.
"Now
you
know
why."
Faukman
was
still
shaking
his
head.
"But
with
all
these
books
written
about
it,
why
isn't
this
theory
more
widely
known?"
"These
books
can't
possibly
compete
with
centuries
