"so
this
should
be
of
no
surprise."
Langdon
felt
a
deep
chill
as
they
approached
the
body.
Before
him
was
one
of
the
strangest
images
he
had
ever
seen.
The
pallid
corpse
of
Jacques
Sauniere
lay
on
the
parquet
floor
exactly
as
it
appeared
in
the
photograph.
As
Langdon
stood
over
the
body
and
squinted
in
the
harsh
light,
he
reminded
himself
to
his
amazement
that
Sauniere
had
spent
his
last
minutes
of
life
arranging
his
own
body
in
this
strange
fashion.
Sauniere
looked
remarkably
fit
for
a
man
of
his
years
and
all
of
his
musculature
was
in
plain
view.
He
had
stripped
off
every
shred
of
clothing,
placed
it
neatly
on
the
floor,
and
laid
down
on
his
back
in
the
center
of
the
wide
corridor,
perfectly
aligned
with
the
long
axis
of
the
room.
His
arms
and
legs
were
sprawled
outward
in
a
wide
spread
eagle,
like
those
of
a
child
making
a
snow
angel
or,
perhaps
more
appropriately,
like
a
man
being
drawn
and
quartered
by
some
invisible
force.
Just
below
Sauniere's
breastbone,
a
bloody
smear
marked
the
spot
where
the
bullet
had
pierced
his
flesh.
The
wound
had
bled
surprisingly
little,
leaving
only
a
small
