in
a
well
lit
abbey
had
been
formed
during
the
peak
summer
tourist
season.
Today
was
a
rainy
April
morning.
Rather
than
crowds
and
shimmering
stained
glass,
all
Langdon
saw
was
acres
of
desolate
floor
and
shadowy,
empty
alcoves.
"We
passed
through
metal
detectors,"
Sophie
reminded,
apparently
sensing
Langdon's
apprehension.
"If
anyone
is
in
here,
they
can't

felt

to
bring
the

police
with
them,
but
Sophie's
fears
of

put

Unfortunately,
their
only
chance
to
recover
the
keystone
seemed
to
be
here
and
now
at
the
tomb
of
Isaac
Newton.
Whoever
held
the
cryptex
would
have
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
tomb
to
decipher
the
final
clue,
and

not
already
come
and

Sophie
and
Langdon
intended
