"Miss
Neveu?"
She
shook
her
head.
"What
would
you
two
do
without
me?"
Teabing
said.
"Very
well,
I
will
walk
you
through
it.
It's
quite
simple
really.
The
first
line
is
the
key.
Would
you
read
it
please?"
Langdon
read
aloud.
"
'In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.'
"Precisely.
A
knight
a
Pope
interred."
He
eyed
Langdon.
"What
does
that
mean
to
you?"
Langdon
shrugged.
"A
knight
buried
by
a
Pope?
A
knight
whose
funeral
was
presided
over
by
a
Pope?"
Teabing
laughed
loudly.
"Oh,
that's
rich.
Always
the
optimist,
Robert.
Look
at
the
second
line.
This
knight
obviously
did
something
that
incurred
the
Holy
wrath
of
the
Church.
Think
again.
Consider
the
dynamic
between
the
Church
and
the
Knights
Templar.
A
knight
a
Pope
interred?"
"A
knight
a
Pope
killed?"
Sophie
asked.
Teabing
smiled
and
patted
her
knee.
"Well
done,
my
dear.
A
knight
a
Pope
buried.
Or
killed."
Langdon
thought
of
the
notorious
Templar
round
up
in
1307
unlucky
Friday
the
thirteenth
when
Pope
Clement
killed
and
interred
hundreds
of
Knights
Templar.
"But
there
must
be
endless
graves
of
'knights
killed
by
Popes.'
"Aha,
not
so!
"Teabing
said.
"Many
of
them
were
burned
at
the
stake
