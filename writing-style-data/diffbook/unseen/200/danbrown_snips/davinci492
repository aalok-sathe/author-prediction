into
the
cavity
and
apply
pressure
to
the
glass
vial,
eventually
shattering
it
if
she
pulled
too
hard.
Pull
gently,
she
told
herself.
Teabing
and
Langdon
both
leaned
in
as
Sophie
wrapped
her
palms
around
the
ends
of
the
cylinder.
In
the
excitement
of
deciphering
the
code
word,
Sophie
had
almost
forgotten
what
they
expected
to
find
inside.
This
is
the
Priory
keystone.
According
to
Teabing,
it
contained
a
map
to
the
Holy
Grail,
unveiling
the
tomb
of
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
Sangreal
treasure
the
ultimate
treasure
trove
of
secret
truth.
Now
gripping
the
stone
tube,
Sophie
double
checked
that
all
of
the
letters
were
properly
aligned
with
the
indicator.
Then,
slowly,
she
pulled.
Nothing
happened.
She
applied
a
little
more
force.
Suddenly,
the
stone
slid
apart
like
a
well
crafted
telescope.
The
heavy
end
piece
detached
in
her
hand.
Langdon
and
Teabing
almost
jumped
to
their
feet.
Sophie's
heart
rate
climbed
as
she
set
the
end
cap
on
the
table
and
tipped
the
cylinder
to
peer
inside.
A
scroll!
Peering
down
the
hollow
of
the
rolled
paper,
Sophie
could
see
it
had
been
wrapped
around
a
cylindrical
object
the
vial
of
vinegar,
she
assumed.
Strangely,
though,
the
paper
