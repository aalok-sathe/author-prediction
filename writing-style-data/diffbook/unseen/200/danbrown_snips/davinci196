of
the
ordinary.
Not
on
the
floor,
on
the
walls,
or
even
on
the
canvas
itself.
There
must
be
something
here!
Sophie
felt
totally
certain
she
had
deciphered
her
grandfather's
intentions
correctly.
What
else
could
he
possibly
intend?
The
masterpiece
she
was
examining
was
a
five
foot
tall
canvas.
The
bizarre
scene
Da
Vinci
had
painted
included
an
awkwardly
posed
Virgin
Mary
sitting
with
Baby
Jesus,
John
the
Baptist,
and
the
Angel
Uriel
on
a
perilous
outcropping
of
rocks.
When
Sophie
was
a
little
girl,
no
trip

grandfather
dragging
her
across
the
room
to
see
this
second
painting.
Grand

I'm
here!
But
I
don

see
it!
Behind
her,
Sophie
could
hear
the
guard
trying
to
radio
again
for
help.
Think!
She
pictured
the
message
scrawled
on
the
protective
glass
of
the
Mona
Lisa.
So
dark
the
con
of
man.
The
painting
before
her
had
no
protective
glass
on
which
to
write
a
message,
and
Sophie
knew
her
grandfather
would
never
have
defaced
this
masterpiece
by
writing
on
the
painting
itself.
She
paused.
At
least
not
on
the
front.
Her
eyes
shot
upward,
climbing
the
long
cables
that
dangled
from
