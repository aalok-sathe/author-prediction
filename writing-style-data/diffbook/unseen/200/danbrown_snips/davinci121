treatment
for
having
a
famous
grandfather."
No
wonder
she
was
upset
by
the
pictures.
Collet
could
barely
conceive
of
the
unfortunate
coincidence
that
called
in
a
young
woman
to
decipher
a
code
written
by
a
dead
family
member.
Still,
her
actions
made
no
sense.
"But
she
obviously
recognized
the
numbers
as
Fibonacci
numbers
because
she
came
here
and
told
us.
I
don't
understand
why
she
would
leave
the

without
telling
anyone

Collet
could
think
of
only
one
scenario
to
explain

with
his
granddaughter?

so,
what
did
the
message
tell
her?
And
how
did
Langdon
fit
in?
Before
Collet
could
ponder
it
any
further,
the
silence
of
the
deserted
museum
was
shattered
by
an
alarm.
The
bell
sounded
like
it
was
coming
from
inside
the
Grand
Gallery.
"Alarme!
"
one
of
the
agents
yelled,
eyeing
his
feed
from
the
Louvre
security
center.
"Grande
Galerie!
Toilettes
Messieurs!
Fache
wheeled
to
Collet.
"Where's
Langdon?"
"Still
