for
a
moment,
and
then
the
blinking
dot
came
to
an
abrupt
stop
about
ten
yards
outside
the
perimeter
of
the
building.
Fumbling
with
the
controls,
Collet
called
up
a
Paris
street
map
and
recalibrated
the
GPS.
Zooming
in,
he
could
now
see
the
exact
location
of
the
signal.
It
was
no
longer
moving.
It
lay
at
a
dead
stop
in
the
middle
of
Place
du
Carrousel.
Langdon
had
jumped.
Fache
sprinted
down
the
Grand
Gallery
as
Collet's
radio
blared
over
the
distant
sound
of
the
alarm.
"He
jumped!"
Collet
was
yelling.
"I'm
showing
the
signal
out
on
Place
du
Carrousel!
Outside
the
bathroom
window!
And
it's
not
moving
at
all!
Jesus,
I
think
Langdon
has
just
committed
suicide!"
Fache
heard
the
words,
but
they
made
no
sense.
He
kept
running.
The
hallway
seemed
never
ending.
As
he
sprinted
past
Sauniere's
body,
he
set
his
sights
on
the
partitions
at
the
far
end
of
the
Denon
Wing.
The
alarm
was
getting
louder
now.
"Wait!"
Collet's
voice
blared
again
over
the
radio.
"He's
moving!
My
God,
he's
alive.
Langdon's
moving
!
Fache
kept
running,
cursing
the
length
of
the
hallway
with
every
step.
"Langdon's
moving
faster!"
Collet
was
still
yelling
on
