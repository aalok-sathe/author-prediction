Will
Robert
Langdon
and
Sophie
Neveu
be
seeking
accountability
from
your
department?
Will
this
cost
Captain
Fache
his
job?"
Lieutenant
Collet's
smile
was
tired
but
calm.
"It
is
my
experience
that
Captain
Bezu
Fache
seldom
makes
mistakes.
I
have
not
yet
spoken
to
him
on
this
matter,
but
knowing
how
he
operates,
I
suspect
his
public
manhunt
for
Agent
Neveu
and
Mr.
Langdon
was
part
of
a
ruse
to
lure
out
the
real
killer.
The
reporters
exchanged
surprised
looks.
Collet
continued.
"Whether
or
not
Mr.
Langdon
and
Agent
Neveu
were
willing
participants
in
the
sting,
I
do
not
know.
Captain
Fache
tends
to
keep
his
more
creative
methods
to
himself.
All
I
can
confirm
at
this
point
is
that
the
captain
has
successfully
arrested
the
man
responsible,
and
that
Mr.
Langdon
and
Agent
Neveu
are
both
innocent
and
safe."
Fache
had
a
faint
smile
on
his
lips
as
he
turned
back
to
Aringarosa.
"A
good
man,
that
Collet."
Several
moments
passed.
Finally,
Fache
ran
his
hand
over
his
forehead,
slicking
back
his
hair
as
he
gazed
down
at
Aringarosa.
"My
Lord,
before
I
return
to
Paris,
there
is
one
final
matter
I'd
like
to
discuss
your
impromptu
