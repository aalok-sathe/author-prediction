had
already
tried
all
the
obvious
passwords
GRAIL,
GRAAL,
GREAL,
VENUS,
MARIA,
JESUS,
SARAH
but
the
cylinder
had
not
budged.
Far
too
obvious.
Apparently
there
existed
some
other
five
letter
reference
to
the
Rose's
seeded
womb.
The
fact
that
the
word
was
eluding
a
specialist
like
Leigh
Teabing
signified
to
Langdon
that
it
was
no
ordinary
Grail
reference.
"Sir
Leigh?"
Remy
called
over
his
shoulder.
He
was
watching
them
in
the
rearview
mirror
through
the
open
divider.
"You
said
Fleet
Street
is
near
Blackfriars
Bridge?"
"Yes,
take
Victoria
Embankment."
"I'm
sorry.
I'm
not
sure
where
that
is.
We
usually
go
only
to
the
hospital."
Teabing
rolled
his
eyes
at
Langdon
and
Sophie
and
grumbled,
"I
swear,
sometimes
it's
like
baby
sitting
a
child.
One
moment
please.
Help
yourself
to
a
drink
and
savory
snacks."
He
left
them,
clambering
awkwardly
toward
the
open
divider
to
talk
to
Remy.
Sophie
turned
to
Langdon
now,
her
voice
quiet.
"Robert,
nobody
knows
you
and
I
are
in
England."
Langdon
realized
she
was
right.
The
Kent
police
would
tell
Fache
the
plane
was
empty,
and
Fache
would
have
to
assume
they
were
still
in
France.
We
are
invisible.
Leigh's
little
stunt
had
just
bought
