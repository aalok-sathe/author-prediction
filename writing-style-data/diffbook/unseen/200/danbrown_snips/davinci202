were
dead.
And
now,
as
she
called
the
fourth
and
final
number
the
number
she
was
not
supposed
to
call
unless
the
first
three
could
not
be
reached
she
got
an
answering
machine.
The
outgoing
message
offered
no
name
but
simply
asked
the
caller
to
leave
a
message.
"The
floor
panel
has
been
broken!"
she
pleaded
as
she
left
the
message.
"The
other
three
are
dead!"
Sister
Sandrine
did
not
know
the
identities
of
the
four
men
she
protected,
but
the
private
phone
numbers
stashed
beneath
her
bed
were
for
use
on
only
one
condition.
If
that
floor
panel
is
ever
broken,
the
faceless
messenger
had
told
her,
it
means
the
upper
echelon
has
been
breached.
One
of
us
has
been
mortally
threatened
and
been
forced
to
tell
a
desperate
lie.
Call
the
numbers.
Warn
the
others.
Do
not
fail
us
in
this.
It
was
a
silent
alarm.
Foolproof
in
its
simplicity.
The
plan
had
amazed
her
when
she
first
heard
it.
If
the
identity
of
one
brother
was
compromised,
he
could
tell
a
lie
that
would
start
in
motion
a
mechanism
to
warn
the
others.
Tonight,
however,
it
seemed
that
more
than
one
had
been
compromised.
"Please
answer,"
she
