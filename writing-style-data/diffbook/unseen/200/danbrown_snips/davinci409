ask,
who
are
these
men
who
claim
to
speak
the
truth
about
Christ
and
yet
lie
to
cover
up
the
sexual
abuse
of
children
by
their
own
priests?"
Teabing
paused.
"What
happens
to
those
people,
Robert,
if
persuasive
scientific
evidence
comes
out
that
the
Church's
version
of
the
Christ
story
is
inaccurate,
and
that
the
greatest
story
ever
told
is,
in
fact,
the
greatest
story
ever
sold"
Langdon
did
not
respond.
"I'll
tell
you
what
happens
if
the
documents
get
out,"
Teabing
said.
"The
Vatican
faces
a
crisis
of
faith
unprecedented
in
its
two
millennia
history."
After
a
long
silence,
Sophie
said,
"But
if
it
is
the
Church
who
is
responsible
for
this
attack,
why
would
they
act
now?
After
all
these
years?
The
Priory
keeps
the
Sangreal
documents
hidden.
They
pose
no
immediate
threat
to
the
Church."
Teabing
heaved
an
ominous
sigh
and
glanced
at
Langdon.
"Robert,
I
assume
you
are
familiar
with
the
Priory's
final
charge?"
Langdon
felt
his
breath
catch
at
the
thought.
"I
am."
"Miss
Neveu,"
Teabing
said,
"the
Church
and
the
Priory
have
had
a
tacit
understanding
for
years.
That
is,
the
Church
does
not
attack
the
Priory,
and
the
Priory
keeps
the
Sangreal
documents
