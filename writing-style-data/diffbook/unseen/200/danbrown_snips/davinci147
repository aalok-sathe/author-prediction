of
his
anagrams
had
gotten
him
in
trouble
once
when
Sophie
was
a
little
girl.
While
being
interviewed
by
an
American
art
magazine,
Sauniere
had
expressed
his
distaste
for
the
modernist
Cubist
movement
by
noting
that
Picasso's
masterpiece
Les
Demoiselles
d
'Avignon
was
a
perfect
anagram
of
vile
meaningless
doodles.
Picasso
fans
were
not
amused.
"My
grandfather
probably
created
this
Mona
Lisa
anagram
long
ago,"
Sophie
said,
glancing
up
at
Langdon.
And
tonight
he
was
forced
to
use
it
as
a
makeshift
code.
Her
grandfather's
voice
had
called
out
from
beyond
with
chilling
precision.
Leonardo

Why
his
final
words
to

referenced
the
famous
painting,
Sophie
had
no
idea,
but
she
could
think
of
only
one
possibility.
A
disturbing
one.
Those
were
not
his
final
words.
Was
she
supposed
to
visit
the
Mona
Lisa?
Had
her
grandfather
left
her
a
message
there?
The
idea
seemed
perfectly
plausible.
After
all,
the
famous
painting
hung
in
the
Salle
des
Etats
a
private
viewing
chamber
accessible
only
from
the
Grand
Gallery.
In
fact,
Sophie
now
realized,
the
doors
that
opened
into
the
chamber
were
situated
only
twenty
meters
from
where
her
grandfather
had
been
found
dead.
