"Primarily,
the
pentacle
is
a
pagan
religious
symbol."
Fache
nodded.
"Devil
worship."
"No,"
Langdon
corrected,
immediately
realizing
his
choice
of
vocabulary
should
have
been
clearer.
Nowadays,
the
term
pagan
had
become
almost
synonymous
with
devil
worship
a
gross
misconception.
The
word's
roots
actually
reached
back
to
the
Latin
paganus,
meaning
country
dwellers.
"Pagans"
were
literally
unindoctrinated
country
folk
who
clung
to
the
old,
rural
religions
of
Nature
worship.
In
fact,
so
strong
was
the
Church's
fear
of
those
who
lived
in
the
rural
villes
that
the
once
innocuous
word
for
"villager"
villain
came
to
mean
a
wicked
soul.
"The
pentacle,"
Langdon
clarified,
"is
a
pre
Christian
symbol
that
relates
to
Nature
worship.
The
ancients
envisioned
their
world
in
two
halves
masculine
and
feminine.
Their
gods
and
goddesses
worked
to
keep
a
balance
of
power.

When
male
and
female
were
balanced,
there
was
harmony
in
the
world.
When
they
were
unbalanced,
there
was
chaos."
Langdon
motioned
to
Sauniere's

"This
pentacle
is
representative
of
the
female
half
of

concept
religious
historians
call
the
'sacred

or
the
'divine
goddess.'
