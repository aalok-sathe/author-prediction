church
possesses
an
architectural
footprint
matching
that
of
Notre
Dame
to
within
inches.
The
sanctuary
has
played
host
to
the
baptisms
of
the
Marquis
de
Sade
and
Baudelaire,
as
well
as
the
marriage
of
Victor
Hugo.
The
attached
seminary
has
a
well
documented
history
of
unorthodoxy
and
was
once
the
clandestine
meeting
hall
for
numerous
secret
societies.
Tonight,
the
cavernous
nave
of
Saint
Sulpice
was
as
silent
as
a
tomb,
the
only
hint
of
life
the
faint
smell
of
incense
from
mass
earlier
that
evening.
Silas
sensed
an
uneasiness
in
Sister
Sandrine's
demeanor
as
she
led
him
into
the
sanctuary.
He
was
not
surprised
by
this.
Silas
was
accustomed
to
people
being
uncomfortable
with
his
appearance.
"You're
an
American,"
she
said.
"French
by
birth,"
Silas
responded.
"I
had
my
calling
in
Spain,
and
I
now
study
in
the
United
States."
Sister
Sandrine
nodded.
She
was
a
small
woman
with
quiet
eyes.
"And
you
have
never
seen
Saint
Sulpice?"
"I
realize
this
is
almost
a
sin
in
itself."
"She
is
more
beautiful
by
day."
"I
am
certain.
Nonetheless,
I
am
grateful
that
you
would
provide
me
this
opportunity
tonight."
"The
abbe
requested
it.
You
obviously
have
powerful
friends."
You
have
