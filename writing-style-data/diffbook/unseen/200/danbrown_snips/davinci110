men's
room.
What
else
was
I
supposed
to
do
?
She
pictured
her
grandfather's
body,
naked
and
spread
eagle
on
the
floor.
There
was
a
time
when
he
had
meant
the
world
to
her,
yet
tonight,
Sophie
was
surprised
to
feel
almost
no
sadness
for
the
man.
Jacques
Sauniere
was
a
stranger
to
her
now.
Their
relationship
had
evaporated
in
a
single
instant
one
March
night
when
she
was
twenty
two.
Ten
years
ago.
Sophie
had
come
home
a
few
days
early
from
graduate
university
in
England
and
mistakenly
witnessed
her
grandfather
engaged
in
something
Sophie
was
obviously
not
supposed
to
see.
It
was
an
image
she
barely
could
believe
to
this
day.
If
I
hadn't
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
Too
ashamed
and
stunned
to
endure
her
grandfather's
pained
attempts
to
explain,
Sophie
immediately
moved
out
on
her
own,
taking
money
she
had
saved,
and
getting
a
small
flat
with
some
roommates.
She
vowed
never
to
speak
to
anyone
about
what
she
had
seen.
Her
grandfather
tried
desperately
to
reach
her,
sending
cards
and
letters,
begging
Sophie
to
meet
him
so
he
could
explain.
Explain
how!
?
Sophie
never
responded
except
once
to
forbid
him
ever
to
call
