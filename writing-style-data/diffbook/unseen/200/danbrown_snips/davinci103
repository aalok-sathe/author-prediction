and
he
looks
a
lot
better
having
a
suspect
in
custody
already.
Whether
or
not
you
are
guilty,
you
most
certainly
will
be
held
by
DCPJ
until
they
can
figure
out
what
really
happened."
Langdon
felt
like
a
caged
animal.
"Why
are
you
telling
me
all
this?"
"Because,
Mr.
Langdon,
I
believe
you
are
innocent."
Sophie
looked
away
for
a
moment
and
then
back
into
his
eyes.
"And
also
because
it
is
partially
my
fault
that
you're
in
trouble."
"I'm
sorry?
It's
your
fault
Sauniere
is
trying
to
frame
me?"
"Sauniere
wasn't
trying
to
frame
you.
It
was
a
mistake.
That
message
on
the
floor
was
meant
for
me."
Langdon
needed
a
minute
to
process
that
one.
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
"That
message
wasn't
for
the
police.
He
wrote
it
for
me.
I
think
he
was
forced
to
do
everything
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
just
didn't
realize
how
it
would
look
to
the
police."
She
paused.
"The
numbered
code
is
meaningless.
Sauniere
wrote
it
to
make
sure
the
investigation
included
cryptographers,
ensuring
that
would
know
as
soon
as
possible
what
had
happened
to
him."
Langdon
felt
himself
losing
touch
fast.
Whether
or
not
Sophie
Neveu
had
lost
