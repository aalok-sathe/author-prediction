of
the
lid,
positioned
in
the
exact
center.
Langdon
closed
the
lid
and
examined
the
inlaid
symbol
from
the
top.
No
hole.
It
doesn
't
pass
through.
Setting
the
box
on
the
table,
he
looked
around
the
room
and
spied
a
stack
of
papers
with
a
paper
clip
on
it.
Borrowing
the
clip,
he
returned
to
the
box,
opened
it,
and
studied
the
hole
again.
Carefully,
he
unbent
the
paper
clip
and
inserted
one
end
into
the
hole.
He
gave
a
gentle
push.
It
took
almost
no
effort.
He
heard
something
clatter
quietly
onto
the
table.
Langdon
closed
the
lid
to
look.
It
was
a
small
piece
of
wood,
like
a
puzzle
piece.
The
wooden
Rose
had
popped
out
of
the
lid
and
fallen
onto
the
desk.
Speechless,
Langdon
stared
at
the
bare
spot
on
the
lid
where
the
Rose
had
been.
There,
engraved
in
the
wood,
written
in
an
immaculate
hand,
were
four
lines
of
text
in
a
language
he
had
never
seen.
The
characters
look
vaguely
Semitic,
Langdon
thought
to
himself,
and
yet
I
don
't
recognize
the
language!
A
sudden
movement
behind
him
caught
his
attention.
Out
of
nowhere,
a
crushing
blow
to
the
head
knocked
Langdon
