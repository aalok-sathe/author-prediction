the
poem.
Hesitant
to
show
the
entire
poem
to
an
outsider,
Langdon
and
Sophie
had
decided
to
share
just
the
first
two
lines,
those
that
identified
the
knight.
Compartmentalized
cryptography,
Sophie
had
called
it.
When
an
intelligence
agency
intercepted
a
code
containing
sensitive
data,
cryptographers
each
worked
on
a
discrete
section
of
the
code.
This
way,
when
they
broke
it,
no
single
cryptographer
possessed
the
entire
deciphered
message.
In
this
case,
the
precaution
was
probably
excessive;
even
if
this
librarian
saw
the
entire
poem,
identified
the
knight's
tomb,
and
knew
what
orb
was
missing,
the
information
was
useless
without
the
cryptex.
Gettum
sensed
an
urgency
in
the
eyes
of
this
famed
American
scholar,
almost
as
if
his
finding
this
tomb
quickly
were
a
matter
of
critical
importance.
The
green
eyed
woman
accompanying
him
also
seemed
anxious.
Puzzled,
Gettum
put
on
her
glasses
and
examined
the
paper
they
had
just
handed
her.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
His
labor's
fruit
a
Holy
wrath
incurred.
She
glanced
at
her
guests.
"What
is
this?
Some
kind
of
Harvard
scavenger
hunt?"
Langdon's
laugh
sounded
forced.
"Yeah,
something
like
that."
Gettum
paused,
feeling
she
was
not
getting
the
whole
story.
Nonetheless,
she
