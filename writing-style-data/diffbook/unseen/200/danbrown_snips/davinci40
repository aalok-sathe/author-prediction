cell
phone
in
Aringarosa's
cassock
began
vibrating
in
silent
ring
mode.
Despite
airline
regulations
prohibiting
the
use
of
cell
phones
during
flights,
Aringarosa
knew
this
was
a
call
he
could
not
miss.
Only
one
man
possessed
this
number,
the
man
who
had
mailed
Aringarosa
the
phone.
Excited,
the
bishop
answered
quietly.
"Yes?"
"Silas
has
located
the
keystone,"
the
caller
said.
"It
is
in
Paris.
Within
the
Church
of
Saint
Sulpice."
Bishop
Aringarosa
smiled.
"Then
we
are
close."
"We
can
obtain
it
immediately.
But
we
need
your
influence."
"Of
course.
Tell
me
what
to
do."
When
Aringarosa
switched
off
the
phone,
his
heart
was
pounding.
He
gazed
once
again
into
the
void
of
night,
feeling
dwarfed
by
the
events
he
had
put
into
motion.
Five
hundred
miles
away,
the
albino
named
Silas
stood
over
a
small
basin
of
water
and
dabbed
the
blood
from
his
back,
watching
the
patterns
of
red
spinning
in
the
water.
Purge
me
with
hyssop
and
I
shall
be
clean,
he
prayed,
quoting
Psalms.
Wash
me,
and
I
shall
be
whiter
than
snow.
Silas
was
feeling
an
aroused
anticipation
that
he
had
not
felt
since
his
previous
life.
It
both
surprised
and
electrified
him.
For
the
last
