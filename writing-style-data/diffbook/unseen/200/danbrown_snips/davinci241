Knights
discovered
something
down
there
in
the
ruins
something
that
made
them
wealthy
and
powerful
beyond
anyone's
wildest
imagination."
Langdon
quickly
gave
Sophie
the
standard
academic
sketch
of
the
accepted
Knights
Templar
history,
explaining
how
the
Knights
were
in
the
Holy
Land
during
the
Second
Crusade
and
told
King
Baldwin
II
that
they
were
there
to
protect
Christian
pilgrims
on
the
roadways.
Although
unpaid
and
sworn
to
poverty,
the
Knights
told
the
king
they
required
basic
shelter
and
requested
his
permission
to
take
up
residence
in
the
stables
under

Knights
took
up
their
meager
residence
inside
the
devastated
shrine.
The
odd
choice

explained,
had
been
anything

documents

Priory

the
ruins
beneath
the
Holy
of
Holies,
a
sacred
chamber
where
God
Himself
was
believed
to
reside.
Literally,
the
very
center
of
the
Jewish
faith.
For
almost
a
decade,
the
nine
Knights
lived
in
the
ruins,
excavating
in
total
secrecy
through
solid
rock.
Sophie
looked
over.
"And
you
said
they
discovered
something?"
"They
certainly
did,"
Langdon
said,
explaining
how
it
had
taken
nine
years,
