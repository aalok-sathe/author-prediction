I
would
have
obtained
the
keystone
without
complication.
How
was
I
to
imagine
the
Grand
Master
would
go
to
such
ends
to
deceive
me
and
bequeath
the
keystone
to
an
estranged
granddaughter?"
Teabing
looked
at
Sophie
with
disdain.
"Someone
so
unqualified
to
hold
this
knowledge
that
she
required
a
symbologist
baby
sitter."
Teabing
glanced
back
at
Langdon.
"Fortunately,
Robert,
your
involvement
turned
out
to
be
my
saving
grace.
Rather
than
the
keystone
remaining
locked
in
the
depository
bank
forever,
you
extracted
it
and
walked
into
my
home."
Where
else
would
I
run?
Langdon
thought.
The
community
of
Grail
historians
is
small,
and
Teabing
and
I
have
a
history
together.
Teabing
now
looked
smug.
"When
I
learned
Sauniere
left
you
a
dying
message,
I
had
a
pretty
good
idea
you
were
holding
valuable
Priory
information.
Whether
it
was
the
keystone
itself,
or
information
on
where
to
find
it,
I
was
not
sure.
But
with
the
police
on
your
heels,
I
had
a
sneaking
suspicion
you
might
arrive
on
my
doorstep."
Langdon
glared.
"And
if
we
had
not?"
"I
was
formulating
a
plan
to
extend
you
a
helping
hand.
One
way
or
another,
the
keystone
was
coming
to
Chateau
Villette.
The
fact
