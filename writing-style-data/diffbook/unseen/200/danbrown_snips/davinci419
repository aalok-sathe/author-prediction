but
he
knew
it
could
not
be.
"It
seems
obvious,"
the
agent
said,
"that
this
truck
is
how
Langdon
and
Neveu
got
away
from
the
bank."
Collet
was
speechless.
He
thought
of
the
armored
truck
driver
he
had
stopped
at
the
roadblock.
The
Rolex.
His
impatience
to
leave.
never
checked
the
cargo
hold.
Incredulous,
Collet
realized
that
someone
in
the
bank
had
actually
lied
to
DCPJ
about
Langdon
and
Sophie's
whereabouts
and
then
helped
them
escape.
But
who?
And
why?
Collet
wondered
if
maybe
this
were
the
reason
Fache
had
told
him
not
to
take
action
yet.
Maybe
Fache
realized
there
were
more
people
involved
tonight
than
just
Langdon
and
Sophie.
And
if
Langdon
and
Neveu
arrived
in
the
armored
truck,
then
who
drove
the
Audi?
Hundreds
of
miles
to
the
south,
a
chartered
Beechcraft
Baron
58
raced
northward
over
the
Tyrrhenian
Sea.
Despite
calm
skies,
Bishop
Aringarosa
clutched
an
airsickness
bag,
certain
he
could
be
ill
at
any
moment.
His
conversation
with
Paris
had
not
at
all
been
what
he
had
imagined.
Alone
in
the
small
cabin,
Aringarosa
twisted
the
gold
ring
on
his
finger
and
tried
to
ease
his
overwhelming
sense
of
fear
and
desperation.
Everything
in
Paris
