HOLY
GRAIL
THROUGH
TAROT
"Not
surprising,"
Langdon
said
to
Sophie.
"Some
of
our
keywords
have
the
same
names
as
individual
cards."
He
reached
for
the
mouse
to
click
on
a
hyperlink.
"I'm
not
sure
if
your
grandfather
ever
mentioned
it
when
you
played
Tarot
with
him,
Sophie,
but
this
game
is
a
'flash
card
catechism'
into
the
story
of
the
Lost
Bride
and
her
subjugation
by
the
evil
Church."
Sophie
eyed
him,
looking
incredulous.
"I
had
no
idea."
"That's
the
point.
By
teaching
through
a
metaphorical
game,
the
followers
of
the
Grail
disguised
their
message
from
the
watchful
eye
of
the
Church."
Langdon
often
wondered
how
many
modern
card
players
had
any
clue
that
their
four
suits
spades,
hearts,
clubs,
diamonds
were
Grail
related
symbols
that
came
directly
from
Tarot's
four
suits
of
swords,
cups,
scepters,
and
pentacles.
Spades
were
Swords
The
blade.
Male.
Hearts
were
Cups
The
chalice.
Feminine.
Clubs
were
Scepters
The
Royal
Line.
The
flowering
staff.
Diamonds
were
Pentacles
The
goddess.
The
sacred
feminine.
Four
minutes
later,
as
Langdon
began
feeling
fearful
they
would
not
find
what
they
had
come
for,
the
computer
produced
another
hit.
