evidence
bags
on
the
desk.
"And
this?"
The
man
shrugged.
"Force
of
habit.
I
bag
anything
peculiar."
Collet
walked
over.
Peculiar?
"This
Brit's
a
strange
one,"
the
examiner
said.
"Have
a
look
at
this."
He
sifted
through
the
evidence
bags
and
selected
one,
handing
it
to
Collet.
The
photo
showed
the
main
entrance
of
a
Gothic
cathedral
the
traditional,
recessed
archway,
narrowing
through
multiple,
ribbed
layers
to
a
small
doorway.
Collet
studied
the
photo
and
turned.
"This
is
peculiar?"
"Turn
it
over."
On
the
back,
Collet
found
notations
scrawled
in
English,
describing
a
cathedral's
long
hollow
nave
as
a
secret
pagan
tribute
to
a
woman's
womb.
This
was
strange.
The
notation
describing
the
cathedral's
doorway,
however,
was
what
startled
him.
"Hold
on!
He
thinks
a
cathedral's
entrance
represents
a
woman's"
The
examiner
nodded.
"Complete
with
receding
labial
ridges
and
a
nice
little
cinquefoil
clitoris
above
the
doorway."
He
sighed.
"Kind
of
makes
you
want
to
go
back
to
church."
Collet
picked
up
the
second
evidence
bag.
Through
the
plastic,
he
could
see
a
large
glossy
photograph
of
what
appeared
to
be
an
old
document.
The
heading
at
the

"What's
this?"
