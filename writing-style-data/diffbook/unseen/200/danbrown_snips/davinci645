"Do
you,
Leigh?"
Yes
I
do.
Your
poker
face
needs
work,
my
friend.
It
took
me
several
seconds,
but
I
can
see
now
that
you
are
lying.
You
have
no
idea
where
on
Newton
's
tomb
the
answer
lies.
"Truly,
Robert?
You
know
where
on
the
tomb
to
look?"

Langdon's
eyes
was
fleeting
but
Leigh
caught

There
was

The

challenge
would
be
to
persuade
Langdon
to
set
down
the
keystone
so
Teabing
could
safely
end
this
charade.
"A
show
of
faith,"
Teabing
said,
lowering
the
gun
from
Sophie.
"Set
down
the
keystone,
and
we'll
talk."
Langdon
knew
his
lie
had
failed.
He
could
see
the
dark
resolve
in
Teabing's
face
and
knew
the
moment
was
upon
them.
When
I
set
this
