his
lap,
where
he
had
been
protecting
it
during
takeoff.
Now,
as
he
set
the
box
on
the
table,
he
could
sense
Sophie
and
Teabing
leaning
forward
with
anticipation.
Unlatching
the
lid
and
opening
the
box,
Langdon
turned
his
attention
not
to
the
lettered
dials
of
the
cryptex,
but
rather

the
tiny
hole
on
the

of
the

Using
the

text
would

it.
From

Sophie
was
seated
across
the
table,
she
could
not
yet
see
the
text,
but
Langdon's
inability
to
immediately
identify
the
language
surprised
her.
My
grandfather
spoke
a
language
so
obscure
that
even
a
symbologist
can't
identify
it?
She
quickly
realized
she
should
not
find
this
surprising.
This
would
not
be
the
first
secret
Jacques
Sauniere
had
kept
from
his
granddaughter.
Opposite
Sophie,
Leigh
Teabing
felt
ready
to
burst.
Eager

his
chance
