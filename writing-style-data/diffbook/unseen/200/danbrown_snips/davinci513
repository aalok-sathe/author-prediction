rear
of
the
limo's
long
interior,
leaving
the
monk
bound
on
the
floor.
They
settled
onto
the
long
seat
facing
Teabing.
The
Brit
gave
them
both
a
roguish
smile
and
opened
the
cabinet
on
the
limo's
bar.
"Could
I
offer
you
a
drink?
Some
nibblies?
Crisps?
Nuts?
Seltzer?"
Sophie
and
Langdon
both
shook
their
heads.
Teabing
grinned
and
closed
the
bar.
"So
then,
about
this
knight's
tomb"
"Fleet
Street?"
Langdon
asked,
eyeing
Teabing
in
the
back
of
the
limo.
There's
a
crypt
on
Fleet
Street?
So
far,
Leigh
was
being
playfully
cagey
about
where
he
thought
they
would
find
the
"knight's
tomb,"
which,
according
to
the
poem,
would
provide
the
password
for
opening
the
smaller
cryptex.
Teabing
grinned
and
turned
to
Sophie.
"Miss
Neveu,
give
the
Harvard
boy
one
more
shot
at
the
verse,
will
you?"
Sophie
fished
in
her
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
black
cryptex,
which
was
wrapped
in
the
vellum.
Everyone
had
decided
to
leave
the
rosewood
box
and
larger
cryptex
behind
in
the
plane's
strongbox,
carrying
with
them
only
what
they
needed,
the
far
more
portable
and
discreet
black
cryptex.
Sophie
unwrapped
the
vellum
and
handed
the
sheet
to
Langdon.
Although
Langdon
had
read
the
poem
