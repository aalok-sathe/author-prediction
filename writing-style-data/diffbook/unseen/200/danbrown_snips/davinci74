'est
pas
le
moment!"
Fache
sputtered.
"I
tried
to
phone
you."
Sophie
continued
in
English,
as
if
out
of
courtesy
to
Langdon.
"But
your
cell
phone
was
turned
off.
"I
turned
it
off
for
a
reason,"
Fache
hissed.
"I
am
speaking
to
Mr.
Langdon."
"I've
deciphered
the
numeric
code,"
she
said
flatly.
Langdon
felt
a
pulse
of
excitement.
She
broke
the
code
?
Fache
looked
uncertain
how
to
respond.
"Before
I
explain,"
Sophie
said,
"I
have
an
urgent
message
for
Mr.
Langdon."
Fache's
expression
turned
to
one
of
deepening
concern.
"For
Mr.
Langdon?"
She
nodded,
turning
back
to
Langdon.
"You
need
to
contact
the
U.S.
Embassy,
Mr.
Langdon.
They
have
a
message
for
you
from
the
States."
Langdon
reacted
with
surprise,
his
excitement
over
the
code
giving
way
to
a
sudden
ripple
of
concern.
A
message
from
the
States?
He
tried
to
imagine
who
could
be
trying
to
reach
him.
Only
a
few
of
his
colleagues
knew
he
was
in
Paris.
Fache's
broad
jaw
had
tightened
with
the
news.
"The
U.S.
Embassy?"
he
demanded,
sounding
suspicious.
"How
would
they
know
to
find
Mr.
Langdon
here?"
Sophie
shrugged.
"Apparently
they
called
Mr.
Langdon's
hotel,
and
the
concierge
told
them
Mr.
Langdon
