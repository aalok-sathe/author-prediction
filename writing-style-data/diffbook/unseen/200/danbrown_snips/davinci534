his
thighs
now,
and
he
felt
the
onset
of
that
familiar
undertow
of
disorientation
the
body's
defense
mechanism
against
the
pain.
As
the
biting
heat
tore
through
all
of
his
muscles
now,
Silas
clenched
his
eyes
tighter,
determined
that
the
final
image
of
his
life
would
not
be
of
his
own
killer.
Instead
he
pictured
a
younger
Bishop
Aringarosa,
standing
before
the
small
church
in
Spain
the
church
that
he
and
Silas
had
built
with
their
own
hands.
The
beginning
of
my
life.
Silas
felt
as
if
his
body
were
on
fire.
"Take
a
drink,"
the
tuxedoed
man
whispered,
his
accent
French.
"It
will
help
with
your
circulation."
Silas's
eyes
flew
open
in
surprise.
A
blurry
image
was
leaning
over
him,
offering
a
glass
of
liquid.
A
mound
of
shredded
duct
tape
lay
on
the
floor
beside
the
bloodless
knife.
"Drink
this,"
he
repeated.
"The
pain
you
feel
is
the
blood
rushing
into
your
muscles."
Silas
felt
the
fiery
throb
transforming
now
to
a
prickling
sting.
The
vodka
tasted
terrible,
but
he
drank
it,
feeling
grateful.
Fate
had
dealt
Silas
a
healthy
share
of
bad
luck
tonight,
but
God
had
solved
it
all
with
one
miraculous
twist.
God
has
not
