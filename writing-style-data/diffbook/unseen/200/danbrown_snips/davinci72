the
police
force.
The
ministry's
ongoing
foray
into
political
correctness,
Fache
argued,
was
weakening
the
department.
Women
not
only
lacked
the
physicality
necessary
for
police
work,
but
their
mere
presence
posed
a
dangerous
distraction
to
the
men
in
the
field.
As
Fache
had
feared,
Sophie
Neveu
was
proving

At

she
had
a
dogged
determination

the
gallery.
Fache
recoiled
in
disbelief.
"Unacceptable!

For
a
moment,
Robert
Langdon
thought
Bezu
Fache
was
suffering
a
stroke.
The
captain
was
mid
sentence
when
his
jaw
stopped
moving
and
his
eyes
bulged.
His
blistering
gaze
seemed
fixated
on
something
over
Langdon's
shoulder.
