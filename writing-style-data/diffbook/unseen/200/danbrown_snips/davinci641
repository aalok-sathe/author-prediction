privately
with
Langdon
could
mean
only
one
thing.
Langdon'
s
mysterious
manuscript
has
touched
a
nerve
with
the
Priory.
Langdon
has
stumbled
onto
a
truth,
and
Sauniere
fears
its
release.
Teabing
felt
certain
the
Grand
Master
was
summoning
Langdon
to
silence
him.
The
Truth
has

Teabing

I
feel
I
must.
I
just
took
confession
from
a
man
who

"My
