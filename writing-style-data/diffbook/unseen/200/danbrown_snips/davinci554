Not
at
all
what
he
expected.
Andre
Vernet,
according
to
official
records,
was
a
model
citizen.
No
police
record
not
even
a
parking
ticket.
Educated
at
prep
school
and
the
Sorbonne,
he
had
a
cum
laude
degree
in
international
finance.
Interpol
said
Vernet's
name
appeared
in
the
newspapers
from
time
to
time,
but
always
in
a
positive
light.
Apparently
the
man
had
helped
design
the

that
kept

apparently
enjoyed
on
an
exceptionally
high
end
stereo
system
he
had
purchased
several
years
ago.

tonight
from
Interpol
had
been
a
set
of
fingerprints
that
apparently
belonged
to
Teabing's
servant.
The
chief
PTS
examiner
was
reading
the
report
in
a
comfortable
chair
across
the
room.
Collet
looked
over.
"Anything?"
The
examiner
shrugged.
"Prints
belong
to
Remy
Legaludec.
Wanted
for
petty
crime.
Nothing
serious.
Looks
like
he
got
kicked
out
of
university
for
rewiring
phone
jacks
to
get
free
service
later
did
some
petty
theft.
Breaking
and
