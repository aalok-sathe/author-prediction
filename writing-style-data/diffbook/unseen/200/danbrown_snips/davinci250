of
established
history,
especially
when
that
history
is
endorsed
by
the
ultimate
bestseller
of
all
time."
Faukman's
eyes
went
wide.
"Don't
tell
me
Harry
Potter
is
actually
about
the
Holy
Grail."
"I
was
referring
to
the
Bible."
Faukman
cringed.
"I
knew
that."
"Laissez
le!"
Sophie's
shouts
cut
the
air
inside
the
taxi.
"Put
it
down!"
Langdon
jumped
as
Sophie
leaned
forward
over
the
seat
and
yelled
at
the
taxi
driver.
Langdon
could
see
the
driver
was
clutching
his
radio
mouthpiece
and
speaking

Sophie
turned

plunged
her
hand

of
Langdon's

to

back
of
the
driver's
head.

driver
instantly

his
radio,
raising
his
one

hand

"Sophie!"
Langdon
choked.
"What
the
hell"
"Arretez!
"
Sophie
commanded
the
driver.
Trembling,
the
driver
obeyed,
stopping
the
car
and
putting
it
in
park.
It
was
then
that
Langdon
heard
the
metallic
voice
of
the
taxi
company's
dispatcher
coming
from
the
dashboard,
"qui
s'appette
Agent
Sophie
Neveu"
the
radio
crackled.
"Et
un
Americain,
Robert
Langdon"
Langdon's
muscles
turned
rigid.
They
found
us
already?
"Descendez,
