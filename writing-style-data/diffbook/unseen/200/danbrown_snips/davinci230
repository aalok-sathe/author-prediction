his
nerves,
the
bishop
meditated
on
the
purple
amethyst
in
his
ring.
Feeling
the
textures
of
the
mitre
crozier
applique
and
the
facets
of
the
diamonds,
he
reminded
himself
that
this
ring
was
a
symbol
of
power
far
less
than
that
which
he
would
soon
attain.
The
inside
of
Gare
Saint
Lazare
looked
like
every
other
train
station
in
Europe,
a
gaping
indoor
outdoor
cavern
dotted
with
the
usual
suspects
homeless
men
holding
cardboard
signs,
collections
of
bleary
eyed
college
kids
sleeping
on
backpacks
and
zoning
out
to
their
portable
MP3
players,
and
clusters
of
blue
clad
baggage
porters
smoking
cigarettes.
Sophie
raised
her
eyes
to
the
enormous
departure
board
overhead.
The
black
and
white
tabs
reshuffled,
ruffling
downward
as
the
information
refreshed.
When
the
update
was
finished,
Langdon
eyed
the
offerings.
The
topmost
listing
read:
LYON
RAPIDE
3:06
"I
wish
it
left
sooner,"
Sophie
said,
"but
Lyon
will
have
to
do."
Sooner?
Langdon
checked
his
watch
2:59
A.M.
The
train
left
in
seven
minutes
and
they
didn't
even
have
tickets
yet.
Sophie
guided
Langdon
toward
the
ticket
window
and
said,
"Buy
us
two
tickets
with
your
credit
card."
"I
thought
credit
card
usage
could
be
traced
by
"Exactly."
Langdon
