the
Church?
"Who
is
she?"
Sophie
asked.
"That,
my
dear,"
Teabing
replied,
"is
Mary
Magdalene."
Sophie
turned.
"The
prostitute?"
Teabing
drew
a
short
breath,
as
if
the
word
had
injured
him
personally.
"Magdalene
was
no
such
thing.
That
unfortunate
misconception
is
the
legacy
of
a
smear
campaign
launched
by
the
early
Church.
The
Church
needed
to
defame
Mary
Magdalene
in
order
to
cover
up
her
dangerous
secret
her
role
as
the
Holy
Grail."
"Herroe?"
"As
I
mentioned,"
Teabing
clarified,
"the
early
Church
needed
to
convince
the
world
that
the
mortal
prophet
Jesus
was
a
divine
being.
Therefore,
any
gospels
that
described
earthly
aspects
of
Jesus'
life
had
to
be
omitted
from
the
Bible.
Unfortunately
for
the
early
editors,
one
particularly
troubling
earthly
theme
kept
recurring
in
the
gospels.
Mary
Magdalene."
He
paused.
"More
specifically,
her
marriage
to
Jesus
Christ."
"I
beg
your
pardon?"
Sophie's
eyes
moved
to
Langdon
and
then
back
to
Teabing.
"It's
a
matter
of
historical
record,"
Teabing
said,
"and
Da
Vinci
was
certainly
aware
of
that
fact.
The
Last
Supper
practically
shouts
at
the
viewer
that
Jesus
and
Magdalene
were
a
pair.
Sophie
glanced
back
to
the
fresco.
"Notice
that
Jesus
and
Magdalene
are
clothed
as
