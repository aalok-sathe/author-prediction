his
watch
and
looking
more
perturbed
than
worried.
"My
apologies.
Airlines
are
so
unreliable
these
days."
The
priest
mumbled
something
inaudible
and
then
said,
"They
are
waiting
upstairs.
I
will
escort
you
up."
The
library
was
a
vast
square
room
with
dark
wood
from
floor
to
ceiling.
On
all
sides,
towering
bookcases
burgeoned
with
volumes.
The
floor
was
amber
marble
with
black
basalt
trim,
a
handsome
reminder
that
this
building
had
once
been
a
palace.
"Welcome,

a
man's

room.
Aringarosa
tried
to
see

but
the
lights
were

Aringarosa
entered
slowly,
regally
even.
He
could
see
the
shapes
of
three
men
at
a
long
table
on
the
far
side
of
the
room.
The
silhouette
of
the
man
in
the
middle
was
immediately
recognizable
the
obese
Secretariat
Vaticana,
overlord
of
all
legal
matters
within
Vatican
City.
The
other
two
were
high
ranking
Italian
cardinals.
Aringarosa
crossed
the
library
toward
them.
"My
