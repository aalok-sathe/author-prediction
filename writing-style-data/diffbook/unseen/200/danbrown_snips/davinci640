the
Holy
Grail.
Legend
had
always
portrayed
the
Grail
as
a
cruel
mistress,
dancing
in
the
shadows
just
out
of
sight,
whispering
in
your
ear,
luring
you
one
more
step
and
then
evaporating
into
the
mist.
Gazing
out
at
the
rustling
trees
of
College
Garden,
Langdon
sensed
her
playful
presence.
The
signs
were
everywhere.
Like
a
taunting
silhouette
emerging
from
the
fog,
the
branches
of
Britain's
oldest
apple
tree
burgeoned
with
five
petaled
blossoms,
all
glistening
like
Venus.
The
goddess
was
in
the
garden
now.
She
was
dancing
in
the
rain,
singing
songs
of
the
ages,
peeking
out
from
behind
the
bud
filled
branches
as
if
to
remind
Langdon
that
the
fruit
of
knowledge
was
growing
just
beyond
his
reach.
Across
the
room,
Sir
Leigh
Teabing
watched
with
confidence
as
Langdon
gazed
out
the
window
as
if
under
a
spell.
Exactly
as
I
hoped,
Teabing
thought.
He
will
come
around.
For
some
time
now,
Teabing
had
suspected
Langdon
might
hold
the
key
to
the
Grail.
It
was
no
coincidence
that
Teabing
launched
his
plan
into
action
on
the
same
night
Langdon
was
scheduled
to
meet
Jacques
Sauniere.
Listening
in
on
the
curator,
Teabing
was
certain
the
man's
eagerness
to
meet
