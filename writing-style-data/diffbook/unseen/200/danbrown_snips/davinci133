Emerging
from
the
shadows,
Langdon
and
Sophie
moved
stealthily
up
the
deserted
Grand
Gallery
corridor
toward
the
emergency
exit
stairwell.
As
he
moved,
Langdon
felt
like
he
was
trying
to
assemble
a
jigsaw
puzzle
in
the
dark.
The
newest
aspect
of
this
mystery
was
a
deeply
troubling
one:
The
captain
of
the
Judicial
Police
is
trying
to
frame
me
for
murder
"Do
you
think,"
he
whispered,
"that
maybe
Fache
wrote
that
message
on
the
floor?"
Sophie
didn't
even
turn.
"Impossible."
Langdon
wasn't
so
sure.
"He
seems
pretty
intent
on
making
me
look
guilty.
Maybe
he
thought
writing
my
name
on
the
floor
would
help
his
case?"
"The
Fibonacci
sequence?
The
P.S.?
All
the
Da
Vinci
and
goddess
symbolism?
That
had
to
be
my
grandfather."
Langdon
knew
she
was
right.
The
symbolism
of
the
clues
meshed
too
perfectly
the
pentacle,
The
Vitruvian
Man,
Da
Vinci,
the
goddess,
and
even
the
Fibonacci
sequence.
A
coherent
symbolic
set,
as
iconographers
would
call
it.
All
inextricably
tied.
"And
his
phone
call
to
me
this
afternoon,"
Sophie
added.
"He
said
he
had
to
tell
me
something.
I'm
certain
his
message
at
the
Louvre
was
his
final
effort
to
tell
me
something
important,
something
he
thought
