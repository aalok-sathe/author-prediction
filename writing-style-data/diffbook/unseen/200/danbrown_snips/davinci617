said,
"I
never
had
any
intention
of
your
being
involved.
You
came
to
my
home.
You
came
searching
for
me.
"Leigh?"
Langdon
finally
managed.
"What
the
hell
are
you
doing?
We
thought
you
were
in
trouble.
We
came
here
to
help
you!"
"As
I
trusted
you
would,"
he
said.
"We
have

to

Langdon
and
Sophie
seemed
unable
to
tear
their
stunned
gazes
from
the
revolver
aimed

and

"What
are
you
talking
about?"
Langdon
said.
"Betrayed
the
Sangreal?"
"I
discovered
a
terrible
truth,"
Teabing
said,
sighing.
"I
learned
why
the
Sangreal
documents
were
never
revealed
to
the
world.
I
learned
that
the
Priory
had
decided
not
to
release

millennium
passed
without
any
revelation,
why
nothing
happened
as
we
entered

Langdon
drew
