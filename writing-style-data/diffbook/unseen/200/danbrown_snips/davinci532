as
he
inched
deeper
into
the
circular
room.
This
had
to
be
the
place.
In
a
rubbish
strewn
alley
very
close
to
Temple
Church,
Remy
Legaludec
pulled
the
Jaguar
limousine
to
a
stop
behind
a
row
of
industrial
waste
bins.
Killing
the
engine,
he
checked
the
area.
Deserted.
He
got
out
of
the
car,
walked
toward
the
rear,
and
climbed
back
into
the
limousine's
main
cabin
where
the
monk
was.
Sensing
Remy's
presence,
the
monk
in
the
back
emerged
from
a
prayer
like
trance,
his
red
eyes
looking
more
curious
than
fearful.
All
evening
Remy
had
been
impressed
with
this
trussed
man's
ability
to
stay
calm.
After
some
initial
struggles
in
the
Range
Rover,
the
monk
seemed
to
have
accepted
his
plight
and
given
over
his
fate
to
a
higher
power.
Loosening
his
bow
tie,
Remy
unbuttoned
his
high,
starched,
wing
tipped
collar
and
felt
as
if
he
could
breathe
for
the
first
time
in
years.
He
went
to
the
limousine's
wet
bar,
where
he
poured
himself
a
Smirnoff
vodka.
He
drank
it
in
a
single
swallow
and
followed
it
with
a
second.
Soon
I
will
be
a
man
of
leisure.
Searching
the
bar,
Remy
found
a
standard
service
wine
