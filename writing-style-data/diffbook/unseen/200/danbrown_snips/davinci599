worn
away
with
centuries
of
foot
traffic,
leaving
it
to
one's
imagination
whose
relics
might
lie
below
the
tile
in
the
undercroft.
Designed
in
the
style
of
the
great
cathedrals
of
Amiens,
Chartres,
and
Canterbury,
Westminster
Abbey
is
considered
neither
cathedral
nor
parish
church.
It
bears
the
classification
of
royal
peculiar,
subject
only
to
the
Sovereign.
Since
hosting
the
coronation
of
William
the
Conqueror
on
Christmas
Day
in
1066,
the
dazzling
sanctuary
has
witnessed
an
endless
procession
of
royal
ceremonies
and
affairs
of
state
from
the
canonization
of
Edward
the
Confessor,
to
the
marriage
of
Prince
Andrew
and
Sarah
Ferguson,
to
the
funerals
of
Henry
V,
Queen
Elizabeth
I,
and
Lady
Diana.
Even
so,
Robert
Langdon
currently
felt
no
interest
in
any
of
the
abbey's
ancient
history,
save
one
event
the
funeral
of
the
British
knight
Sir
Isaac
Newton.
In
London
lies
a
knight
a
Pope
interred.
Hurrying
through
the
grand
portico
on
the
north
transept,
Langdon
and
Sophie
were
met
by
guards
who
politely
ushered
them
through
the
abbey's
newest
addition
a
large
walk
through
metal
detector
now
present
in
most
historic
buildings
in
London.
They
both
passed
through
without
setting
off
the
alarm
and
continued
to
the
abbey
