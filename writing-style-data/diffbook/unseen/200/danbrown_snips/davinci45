in
Rome.
He
flashed
on
Vittoria
again.
She
had
been
absent
from
his
dreams
for
months.
Langdon
could
not
believe
Rome
had
been
only
a
year
ago;
it
felt
like
decades.
Another
life.
His
last
correspondence
from
Vittoria
had
been
in
December
a
postcard
saying
she
was
headed
to
the
Java
Sea
to
continue
her
research
in
entanglement
physics
something
about
using
satellites
to
track
manta
ray
migrations.
Langdon
had
never
harbored
delusions
that
a
woman
like
Vittoria
Vetra
could
have
been
happy

never
imagined

could
feel.
His
lifelong
affinity
for
bachelorhood
and
the
simple
freedoms
it
allowed
had
been
shaken
somehow
replaced
by
an
unexpected
emptiness
that
seemed
to
have
grown
over
the
past
year.
They
continued
walking
briskly,
yet
Langdon
still
saw
no
corpse.
"Jacques
Sauniere
went
this
far?"
"Mr.
Sauniere
suffered
a
bullet
wound
to
his
stomach.
He
died
very
slowly.
Perhaps
over
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes.
He
was
obviously
a
man
of
great
personal
strength."
Langdon
turned,
appalled.
"Security
took
fifteen
minutes
to
get
here?"
"Of
course
not.
Louvre
security
responded
immediately
to
the
alarm
and
