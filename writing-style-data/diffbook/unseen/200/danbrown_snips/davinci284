are
arriving
as
we
speak."
Sophie
had
no
intention
of
leaving
empty
handed.
"Tell
them
we
came
and
went
already.
If
they
want
to
search
the
bank,
demand
a
search
warrant.
That
will
take
them
time."
"Listen,"
Vernet
said,
"Jacques
was
a
friend,
and
my
bank
does
not
need
this
kind
of
press,
so
for
those
two
reasons,
I
have
no
intention
of
allowing
this
arrest
to
be
made
on
my
premises.
Give
me
a
minute
and
I
will
see
what
I
can
do
to
help
you
leave
the
bank
undetected.
Beyond
that,
I
cannot
get
involved."
He
stood
up
and
hurried
for
the
door.
"Stay
here.
I'll
make
arrangements
and
be
right
back."
"But
the
safe
deposit
box,"
Sophie
declared.
"We
can't
just
leave."
"There's
nothing
I
can
do,"
Vernet
said,
hurrying
out
the
door.
"I'm
sorry."
Sophie
stared
after
him
a
moment,
wondering
if
maybe
the
account
number
was
buried
in
one
of
the
countless
letters
and
packages
her
grandfather
had
sent
her
over
the
years
and
which
she
had
left
unopened.
Langdon
stood
suddenly,
and
Sophie
sensed
an
unexpected
glimmer
of
contentment
in
his
eyes.
"Robert?
You're
smiling."
"Your
grandfather
was
a
genius."
"I'm
sorry?"
"Ten
digits?"
