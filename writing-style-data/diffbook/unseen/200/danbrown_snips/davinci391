her
as
the
progenitor
of
the
royal
line
of
kings.
Countless
scholars
of
that
era
chronicled
Mary
Magdalene's
days
in
France,
including
the
birth
of
Sarah
and
the
subsequent
family
tree."
Sophie
was
startled.
"There
exists
a
family
tree
of
Jesus
Christ?"
"Indeed.
And
it
is
purportedly
one
of
the
cornerstones
of
the
Sangreal
documents.
A
complete
genealogy
of
the
early
descendants
of
Christ."
"But
what
good
is
a
documented
genealogy
of
Christ's
bloodline?"
Sophie
asked.
"It's
not
proof.
Historians
could
not
possibly
confirm
its
authenticity."
Teabing
chuckled.
"No
more
so
than
they
can
confirm
the
authenticity
of
the
Bible.
"Meaning?"
"Meaning
that
history
is
always
written
by
the
winners.
When
two
cultures
clash,
the
loser
is
obliterated,
and
the
winner
writes
the
history
books
books
which
glorify
their
own
cause
and
disparage
the
conquered
foe.
As
Napoleon
once
said,
'What
is
history,
but
a
fable
agreed
upon?'
He
smiled.
"By
its
very
nature,
history
is
always
a
one
sided
account."
Sophie
had
never
thought
of
it
that
way.
"The
Sangreal
documents
simply
tell
the
other
side
of
the
Christ
story.
In
the
end,
which
side
of
the
story
you
believe
becomes
a
matter
of
faith
and
personal
exploration,
