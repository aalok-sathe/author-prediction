the
sacred
feminine

called
unclean.
It
was
man,
not
God,
who
created
the
concept
of
'original
sin,'
whereby
Eve
tasted
of
the
apple
and
caused
the
downfall
of
the
human
race.
Woman,
once
the

giver
of
life,

enemy."
"I
should
add,"
Teabing
chimed,
"that
this
concept
of
woman
as
life
bringer
was
the
foundation
of
ancient

Genesis

end
for
the
goddess."

stories
of
forbidden

to

the

Knights
