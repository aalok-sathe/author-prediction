she
turned
and
faced
Langdon
in
the
deserted
ballroom.
He
was
already
shaking
his
head
as
if
reading
her
mind.
"No,
Sophie,"
he
whispered,
his
eyes
reassuring.
"The
same
thought
crossed
my
mind
when
I
realized
your
grandfather
was
in
the
Priory,
and
you
said
he
wanted
to
tell
you
a
secret
about
your
family.
But
it's
impossible."
Langdon
paused.
"Sauniere
is
not
a
Merovingian
name."
Sophie
wasn't
sure
whether
to
feel
relieved
or
disappointed.
Earlier,
Langdon
had
asked
an
unusual
passing
question
about
Sophie's
mother's
maiden
name.
Chauvel.
The
question
now
made
sense.
"And
Chauvel?"
she
asked,
anxious.
Again
he
shook
his
head.
"I'm
sorry.
I
know
that
would
have
answered
some
questions
for
you.
Only
two
direct
lines
of
Merovingians
remain.
Their
family
names
are
Plantard
and
Saint
Clair.
Both
families
live
in
hiding,
probably
protected
by
the
Priory."
Sophie
repeated
the
names
silently
in
her
mind
and
then
shook
her
head.
There
was
no
one
in
her
family
named
Plantard
or
Saint
Clair.
A
weary
undertow
was
pulling
at
her
now.
She
realized
she
was
no
closer
than
she
had
been
at
the
Louvre
to
understanding
what
truth
her
grandfather
had
wanted
to
reveal
to
her.
Sophie
