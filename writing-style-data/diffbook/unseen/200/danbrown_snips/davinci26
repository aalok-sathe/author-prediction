grateful
simply
for
the
opportunity
to
meet
him.
"Mr.
Langdon,
can
you
at
least
guess
what
our
murder
victim
might
have
wanted
to
discuss
with
you
on
the
night
he
was
killed?
It
might
be
helpful."
The
pointedness
of
the
question
made
Langdon
uncomfortable.
"I
really
can't
imagine.
I
didn't
ask.
I
felt
honored
to
have
been
contacted
at
all.
I'm
an
admirer
of
Mr.
Sauniere's
work.
I
use
his
texts
often
in
my
classes."
Fache
made
note
of
that
fact

The
two
men
were
now
halfway

and
Langdon
could

"So

with
him?"
Fache
asked.
"Yes.

spent
much
of
the
last
year
writing
the
draft
for
a
book
that
deals
with
Mr.
Sauniere's
primary
area
of
expertise.
I
was
looking
forward
to
picking
his
brain."
Fache
glanced
up.
"Pardon?"
The
idiom
apparently
didn't
translate.
"I
was
looking
forward
to
learning
his
thoughts
on
the
topic."
"I
see.
And
what
is
the
topic?"
Langdon
hesitated,
uncertain
exactly
how
to
put
it.
"Essentially,
the
manuscript
is
about
the
iconography
of
goddess
worship
the
concept
of
