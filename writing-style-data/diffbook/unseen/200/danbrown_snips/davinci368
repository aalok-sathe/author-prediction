identification.
So
why
won't
they
let
us
inside
for
a
look?
Finally,
Collet's
cellular
phone
rang.
It
was
the
command
post
at
the
Louvre.
"Do
we
have
a
search
warrant
yet?"
Collet
demanded.
"Forget
about
the
bank,
Lieutenant,"
the
agent
told
him.
"We
just
got
a
tip.
We
have
the
exact
location
where
Langdon
and
Neveu
are
hiding."
Collet
sat
down
hard
on
the
hood
of
his
car.
"You're
kidding."
"I
have
an
address
in
the
suburbs.
Somewhere
near
Versailles."
"Does
Captain
Fache
know?"
"Not
yet.
He's
busy
on
an
important
call."
"I'm
on
my
way.
Have
him
call
as
soon
as
he's
free."
Collet
took
down
the
address
and
jumped
in
his
car.
As
he
peeled
away
from
the
bank,
Collet
realized
he
had
forgotten
to
ask
who
had
tipped
DCPJ
off
to
Langdon's
location.
Not
that
it
mattered.
Collet
had
been
blessed
with
a
chance
to
redeem
his
skepticism
and
earlier
blunders.
He
was
about
to
make
the
most
high
profile
arrest
of
his
career.
Collet
radioed
the
five
cars
accompanying
him.
"No
sirens,
men.
Langdon
can't
know
we're
coming."
Forty
kilometers
away,
a
black
Audi
pulled
off
a
rural
road
and
parked
in
the
shadows
on
the
