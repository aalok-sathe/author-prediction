the
walls
made
it
virtually
impossible
to
get
a
carrier
unless
you
stepped
out
into
the
hall.
The
guard
was
backing
quickly
toward
the
exit
now,
and
Sophie
knew
she
had
to
act
immediately.
Gazing
up
at
the
large
painting
behind
which
she
was
partially
ensconced,
Sophie
realized
that
Leonardo
da
Vinci,
for
the
second
time
tonight,
was
there
to
help.
Another
few
meters,
Grouard
told
himself,
keeping
his
gun
leveled.
"Arretez!
Ouje
la
detruis!"
the
woman's
voice
echoed
across
the
room.
Grouard
glanced

and
stopped
in
his

of
her.
At
five
feet
tall,
the
canvas
almost
entirely
hid
her
body.
Grouard's
first
thought
was
to
wonder
why
the
painting's
trip
wires
hadn't
set
off
alarms,
but
of
course
the
artwork
cable
sensors
had
yet
to
be
reset
tonight.
What
is
she
doing!
When
he
saw
it,
his
blood
went
cold.
The
canvas
started
to
bulge
in
the
middle,
the
fragile
outlines
of
the
Virgin
Mary,
Baby
Jesus,
and
John
the
Baptist
beginning
to
distort.
"Non!"
Grouard
screamed,
