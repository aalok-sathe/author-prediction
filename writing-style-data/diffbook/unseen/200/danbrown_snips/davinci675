know."
The
woman
placed
her
tender
hands
on
Sophie's
shoulders
and
gazed
at
her
with
familiar
eyes.
"Your
grandfather
and
I
were
forced
to
say
so
many
things.
We
did
what
we
thought
was
right.
I'm
so
sorry.
It
was
for
your
own
safety,
princess."
Sophie
heard
her
final
word,
and
immediately
thought
of
her
grandfather,
who
had
called
her
princess
for
so
many
years.
The
sound
of
his
voice
seemed
to
echo
now
in
the
ancient
stones
of
Rosslyn,
settling
through
the
earth
and
reverberating
in
the
unknown
hollows
below.
The
woman
threw
her
arms
around
Sophie,
the
tears
flowing
faster.
"Your
grandfather
wanted
so
badly
to
tell
you
everything.
But
things
were
difficult
between
you
two.
He
tried
so
hard.
There's
so
much
to
explain.
So
very
much
to
explain."
She
kissed
Sophie's
forehead
once
again,
then
whispered
in
her
ear.
"No
more
secrets,
princess.
It's
time
you
learn
the
truth
about
our
family."
Sophie
and
her
grandmother
were
seated
on
the
porch
stairs
in
a
tearful
hug
when
the
young
docent
dashed
across
the
lawn,
his
eyes
shining
with
hope
and
disbelief.
"Sophie?"
Through
her
tears,
Sophie
nodded,
standing.
She
did
not
know
the
young
man's
face,
