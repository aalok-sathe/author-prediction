the
necessary
strength
to
carry
out
that
task."
Sophie
paused.
"I'm
not
sure
that
is
my
decision
to
make."
Teabing's
eyebrows
arched.
"No?
If
not
the
possessor
of
the
keystone,
then
who?"
"The
brotherhood
who
has
successfully
protected
the
secret
for
so
long."
"The
Priory?"
Teabing
looked
skeptical.
"But
how?
The
brotherhood
was
shattered
tonight.
Decapitated,
as
you
so
aptly
put
it.
Whether

has
not
protected
the
truth
all
these
years
to
have
it
gather
dust
until
eternity.
They
have
been
waiting
for
the
right
moment
in
history
to
share
their
secret.
A
time
when
the
world
is
ready
to
handle
the
truth."
"And
you
believe
that
moment
has
arrived?"
Langdon
asked.
"Absolutely.
It
could
not
be
more
obvious.
All
the
historical
signs
are
in

and
