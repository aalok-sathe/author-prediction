remember
what
city
they
were
in
now.
Up
ahead
on
the
street,
a
couple
of
city
policemen
stood
on
the
curb
giving
directions
to
some
confused
tourists.
Sophie
pulled
her
SmartCar
in
behind
the
line
of
taxis
and
parked
in
a
red
zone
despite
plenty
of
legal
parking
across
the
street.
Before
Langdon
could
ask
what
was
going
on,
she
was
out
of
the
car.
She
hurried
to
the
window
of
the
taxi
in
front
of
them
and
began
speaking
to
the
driver.
As
Langdon
got
out
of
the
SmartCar,
he
saw
Sophie
hand
the
taxi
driver
a
big
wad
of
cash.
The
taxi
driver
nodded
and
then,
to
Langdon's
bewilderment,
sped
off
without
them.
"What
happened?"
Langdon
demanded,
joining
Sophie
on
the
curb
as
the
taxi
disappeared.
Sophie
was
already
heading
for
the
train
station
entrance.
"Come
on.
We're
buying
two
tickets
on
the
next
train
out
of
Paris."
Langdon
hurried
along
beside
her.
What
had
begun
as
a
one
mile
dash
to
the
U.S.
Embassy
had
now
become
a
full
fledged
evacuation
from
Paris.
Langdon
was
liking
this
idea
less
and
less.
The
driver
who
collected
Bishop
Aringarosa
from
Leonardo
da
Vinci
International
Airport
pulled
up
in
a
