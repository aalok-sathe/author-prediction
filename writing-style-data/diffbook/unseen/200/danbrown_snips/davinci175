a
three
digit
code,
and
then
listen
to
a
recording.
But
if
Langdon
didn't
phone
the
embassy,
then
who
the
hell
did
he
call?
It
was
at
that
moment,
eyeing
his
cellular
phone,
that
Fache
realized
the
answers
were
in
the
palm
of
his
hand.
Langdon
used
my
phone
to
place
that
call.
Keying
into
the
cell
phone's
menu,
Fache
pulled
up
the
list
of
recently
dialed
numbers
and
found
the
call
Langdon
had
placed.
A
Paris
exchange,
followed
by
the
three
digit
code
454.
Redialing
the
phone
number,
Fache
waited
as
the
line
began
ringing.
Finally
a
woman's
voice
answered.
"Bonjour,

chez
Sophie
Neveu,

the
recording
announced.
"Je
suis
absente
pour
le
moment,
mais"
Fache's
blood
was
boiling
as
he
typed
the
numbers
4
5
4.
Despite
her
monumental
reputation,
the
Mona
Lisa
was
a
mere
thirty
one
inches
by
twenty
one
inches
smaller
even
than
the
posters
of
her
sold
in
the
Louvre
gift
shop.
She
hung
on
the
northwest
wall
of
the
Salle
des
Etats
behind
a
two
inch
thick
pane
of
protective
Plexiglas.
Painted
on
a
poplar
wood
panel,
her
ethereal,
mist
filled
atmosphere
was
attributed
to
Da
Vinci's
mastery
of
the
