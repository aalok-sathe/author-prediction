As
they
ran
across
the
plaza
to
Sophie's
car,
Langdon
could
hear
police
sirens
wailing
in
the
distance.
"That's
it
there,"
Sophie
called,
pointing
to
a
red
snub
nosed
two
seater
parked
on
the
plaza.
She's
kidding,
right?
The
vehicle
was
easily
the
smallest
car
Langdon
had
ever
seen.
"SmartCar,"
she
said.
"A
hundred
kilometers
to
the
liter."
Langdon
had
barely
thrown
himself
into
the
passenger
seat
before
Sophie
gunned
the
SmartCar
up
and
over
a
curb
onto
a
gravel
divider.
He
gripped
the
dash
as
the
car
shot
out
across
a
sidewalk
and
bounced

over
into
the
small
rotary
at
Carrousel

For
an
instant,
Sophie
seemed
to
consider
taking
the
shortcut
across
the
rotary
by
plowing
straight
ahead,
through
the
median's
perimeter
hedge,
and
bisecting
the
large
circle
of
grass
in
the
center.
"No!"
Langdon
shouted,
knowing
the
hedges
around
Carrousel
du
Louvre
were
there
to
hide
the
perilous
chasm
in
the
center
La
Pyramide
Inversee
the
upside
down
pyramid
skylight
he
had
seen
earlier
from
inside
the
museum.
It
was
large
enough
to
swallow
their
Smart
Car
in
a
single
gulp.
Fortunately,
Sophie
decided
on
the
more
conventional
route,
jamming
the
wheel
hard
to
