No,
I
do
not
know
the
answer.
And
I
can
admit
that
freely.
A
true
knight
learns
humility
in
the
face
of
the
Grail.
He
learns
to
obey
the
signs
placed
before
him.
When
I
saw
you
enter
the
abbey,
I
understood.
You
were
here
for
a
reason.
To
help.
I
am
not
looking
for
singular
glory
here.
I
serve
a
far
greater
master
than
my
own
pride.
The
Truth.
Mankind
deserves
to
know
that
truth.
The
Grail
found
us
all,
and
now
she
is
begging
to
be
revealed.
We
must
work
together."
Despite
Teabing's
pleas
for
cooperation
and
trust,
his
gun
remained
trained
on
Sophie
as
Langdon
stepped
forward
and
accepted
the
cold
marble
cylinder.
The
vinegar

as
Langdon
grasped
it
and
stepped
backward.
The
dials
were
still
in
random
order,
and
the
cryptex
remained
locked.
Langdon
eyed
Teabing.
"How
do
you
know
I
won't
smash
it
right
now?"
Teabing's
laugh
was
an
eerie
chortle.
"I
should
have
realized
your
threat
to
break
it
in
the
Temple
Church
was
an
empty
one.
Robert
Langdon
would
never
break
the
keystone.
You
are
an
historian,
Robert.
You
are
holding
the
key
to
two
thousand
years
of
history
the
lost
