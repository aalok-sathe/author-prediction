Silence
at
last.
As
Langdon
walked
toward
the
front
of
the
truck,
he
felt
surprisingly
alert.
Staring
into
the
barrel
of
yet
another
gun
tonight
had
given
him
a
second
wind.
He
took
a
deep
breath
of
nighttime
air
and
tried
to
get
his
wits
about
him.
Accompanying
the
gravity
of
being
a
hunted
man,
Langdon
was
starting
to
feel
the
ponderous
weight
of
responsibility,
the
prospect
that
he
and
Sophie
might
actually
be
holding
an
encrypted
set
of
directions
to
one
of
the
most
enduring
mysteries
of
all
time.
As
if
this
burden
were
not
great
enough,
Langdon
now
realized
that
any
possibility
of
finding
a
way
to
return
the
keystone
to
the
Priory
had
just
evaporated.
News
of
the
three
additional
murders
had
dire
implications.
The
Priory
has
been
infiltrated.
They
are
compromised.
The
brotherhood
was
obviously
being
watched,
or
there
was
a
mole
within
the
ranks.
It
seemed
to
explain
why
Sauniere
might
have
transferred
the
keystone
to
Sophie
and
Langdon
people
outside
the
brotherhood,
people
he
knew
were
not
compromised.
We
can
't
very
well
give
the
keystone
back
to
the
brotherhood.
Even
if
Langdon
had
any
idea
how
to
find
a
Priory
member,
chances
were
