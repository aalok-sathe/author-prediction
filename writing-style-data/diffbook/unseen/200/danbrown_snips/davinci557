immaculately
clean
loft.
"Only
one
set
of
prints
up
here.
We'll
have
an
ID
shortly."
Collet
squinted
through
the
dim
light
toward
the
far
wall.
What
the
hell?
Nestled
against
the
far
wall
sat
an
elaborate
computer
workstation
two
tower
CPUs,
a
flat
screen
video
monitor
with
speakers,
an
array
of
hard
drives,
and
a
multichannel
audio
console
that
appeared
to
have
its
own
filtered
power
supply.
Why
in
the
world
would
anyone
work
all
the
way
up
here?
Collet
moved
toward
the
gear.
"Have
you
examined
the
system?"
"It's
a
listening
post."
Collet
spun.
"Surveillance?"
The
agent
nodded.
"Very
advanced
surveillance."
He
motioned
to
a
long
project
table
strewn
with
electronic
parts,
manuals,
tools,
wires,
soldering
irons,
and
other
electronic
components.
"Someone
clearly
knows
what
he's
doing.
A
lot
of
this
gear
is
as
sophisticated
as
our
own
equipment.
Miniature
microphones,
photoelectric
recharging
cells,
high
capacity
RAM
chips.
He's
even
got
some
of
those
new
nano
drives."
Collet
was
impressed.
"Here's
a
complete
system,"
the
agent
said,
handing
Collet
an
assembly
not
much
larger
than
a
pocket
calculator.
Dangling
off
the
contraption
was
a
foot
long
wire
with
a
stamp
sized
piece
of
wafer
thin
foil
stuck
on
the
