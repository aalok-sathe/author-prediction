Like
Leonardo,
Walt
Disney
loved
infusing
hidden
messages
and
symbolism
in
his
art.
For
the
trained
symbologist,
watching
an
early
Disney
movie
was
like
being
barraged
by
an
avalanche
of
allusion
and
metaphor.
Most
of
Disney's
hidden
messages
dealt
with
religion,
pagan
myth,
and
stories
of
the
subjugated
goddess.
It
was
no
mistake
that
Disney
retold
tales
like
Cinderella,
Sleeping
Beauty,
and
Snow
White
all
of
which
dealt
with
the
incarceration
of
the
sacred
feminine.
Nor
did
one
need
a
background
in
symbolism
to
understand
that
Snow
White
a
princess
who
fell
from
grace
after
partaking
of
a
poisoned
apple
was
a
clear
allusion
to
the
downfall
of
Eve
in
the
Garden
of
Eden.
Or
that
Sleeping
Beauty's
Princess
Aurora
code
named
"Rose"
and
hidden
deep
in
the
forest
to
protect
her
from
the
clutches
of
the
evil
witch
was
the
Grail
story
for
children.
Despite
its
corporate
image,
Disney
still
had
a
savvy,
playful
element
among
its
employees,
and
their
artists
still
amused
themselves
by
inserting
hidden
symbolism
in
Disney
products.
