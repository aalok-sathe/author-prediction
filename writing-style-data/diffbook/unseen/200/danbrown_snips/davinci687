see
she
was
overwhelmed.
The
news
she
had
received
tonight
had
changed
everything
in
her
life.
"Are
you
okay?
It's
a
lot
to
take
in."
She
smiled
quietly.
"I
have
a
family.
That's
where
I'm
going
to
start.
Who
we
are
and
where
we
came
from
will
take
some
time."
Langdon
remained

"Beyond
tonight,
will

reached
over
and,
taking

led
him
out
of
the
chapel.
They
walked
to
a
small
rise
on
the
bluff.
From
here,
the
Scottish
countryside
spread
out
before
them,
suffused
in
a
pale
moonlight
that
sifted
through
the
departing
clouds.
They
stood
in
silence,
holding
hands,
both
of
them
fighting
the
descending
shroud
of
exhaustion.
The
stars
were
just
now
appearing,
but
to
the
east,
a
single
point
of
light
glowed
brighter
than
any
other.
Langdon
smiled
when
he
saw
it.
It
was
Venus.
