the
floor.
A
code
for
her.
Of
this,
she
was
certain.
Despite
not
understanding
the
meaning
of
his
message,
Sophie
was
certain
its
cryptic
nature
was
additional
proof
that
the
words
were
intended
for
her.
Sophie's
passion
and
aptitude
for
cryptography
were
a
product
of
growing
up
with
Jacques
Sauniere
a
fanatic
himself
for
codes,
word
games,
and
puzzles.
How
many
Sundays
did
we
spend
doing
the
cryptograms
and
crosswords
in
the
newspaper?
At
the
age
of
twelve,
Sophie
could
finish
the
he
Monde
crossword
without
any
help,
and
her
grandfather
graduated
her
to
crosswords
in
English,
mathematical
puzzles,
and
substitution
ciphers.
Sophie
devoured
them
all.
Eventually
she
turned
her
passion
into
a
profession
by
becoming
a
codebreaker
for
the
Judicial
Police.
Tonight,
the
cryptographer
in
Sophie
was
forced
to
respect
the
efficiency
with
which
her
grandfather
had
used
a
simple
code
to
unite
two
total
strangers
Sophie
Neveu
and
Robert
Langdon.
The
question
was
why?
Unfortunately,
from
the
bewildered
look
in
Langdon's
eyes,
Sophie
sensed
the
American
had
no
more
idea
than
she
did
why
her
grandfather
had
thrown
them
together.
She
pressed
again.
"You
and
my
grandfather
had
planned
to
meet
tonight.
What
about?"
Langdon
looked
truly
perplexed.
