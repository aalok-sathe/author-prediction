"The
password,"
Sophie
said,
"appears
to
have
something
to
do
with
the
Templars."
She
read
the
text
aloud.
"
'A
headstone
praised
by
Templars
is
the
key.'
"Leigh,"
Langdon
said,
"you're
the
Templar
specialist.
Any
ideas?"
Teabing
was
silent
for
several
seconds
and
then
sighed.
"Well,
a
headstone
is
obviously
a
grave
marker
of
some
sort.
It's
possible
the
poem
is
referencing
a
gravestone
the
Templars
praised
at
the
tomb
of
Magdalene,
but
that
doesn't
help
us
much
because
we
have
no
idea
where
her
tomb
is."
"The
last
line,"
Sophie
said,
"says
that
Atbash
will
reveal
the
truth.
I've
heard
that
word.
Atbash."
"I'm
not
surprised,"
Langdon
replied.
"You
probably
heard
it
in
Cryptology
101.
The
Atbash
Cipher
is
one
of
the
oldest
codes
known
to
man."
Of
course!
Sophie
thought.
The
famous
Hebrew
encoding
system.
The
Atbash
Cipher
had
indeed
been
part
of
Sophie's
early
cryptology
training.
The
cipher
dated
back
to
500
B.C.
and
was
now
used
as
a
classroom
example
of
a
basic
rotational
