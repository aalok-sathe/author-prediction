whispered
in
fear.
"Where
are
you?"
"Hang
up
the
phone,"
a
deep
voice
said
from
the
doorway.
Turning
in
terror,
she
saw
the
massive
monk.
He
was
clutching
the
heavy
iron
candle
stand.
Shaking,
she
set
the
phone
back
in
the
cradle.
"They
are
dead,"
the
monk
said.
"All
four
of
them.
And
they
have
played
me
for
a
fool.
Tell
me
where
the
keystone
is."
"I
don't
know!"
Sister
Sandrine
said
truthfully.
"That
secret
is
guarded
by
others."
Others
who
are
dead!
The
man
advanced,
his
white
fists
gripping
the
iron
stand.
"You
are
a
sister
of
the
Church,
and
yet
you
serve
them?"
"Jesus
had
but
one
true
message,"
Sister
Sandrine
said
defiantly.
"I
cannot
see
that
message
in
Opus
Dei."
A
sudden
explosion
of
rage
erupted
behind
the
monk's
eyes.
He
lunged,
lashing
out
with
the
candle
stand
like
a
club.
As
Sister
Sandrine
fell,
her
last
feeling
was
an
overwhelming
sense
of
foreboding.
All
four
are
dead.
The
precious
truth
is
lost
forever.
The
security
alarm
on
the
west
end
of
the
Denon
Wing
sent
the
pigeons
in
the
nearby
Tuileries
Gardens
scattering
as
Langdon
and
Sophie
dashed
out
of
the
bulkhead
into
the
Paris
night.
