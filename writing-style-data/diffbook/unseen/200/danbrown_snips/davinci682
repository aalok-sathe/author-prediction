Langdon.
Sing
her
song.
The
world
needs
modern
troubadours."
Langdon
fell
silent,
feeling
the
weight
of
her
message
upon
him.
Across
the
open
spaces,
a
new
moon
was
rising
above
the
tree
line.
Turning
his
eyes
toward
Rosslyn,
Langdon
felt
a
boyish
craving
to
know
her
secrets.
Don't
ask,
he
told
himself.
This
is
not
the
moment.
He
glanced
at
the
papyrus
in
Marie's
hand,
and
then
back
at
Rosslyn.
"Ask
the

Langdon,"
Marie
said,
looking
amused.

the
papyrus
in
her
hand.
"Your
husband's
poem
speaks
specifically
of
Rosslyn,
except
it
also
mentions
a
blade
and
chalice
watching
over
the
Grail.
I
didn't
see
any
symbols
of
the
blade
and
chalice
up
there."
"The
blade
and
chalice?"
Marie
asked.
"What
exactly
do
they
look
like?"
Langdon
sensed
she
was
toying
with
him,
but
he
played
along,
quickly
describing
the
symbols.
