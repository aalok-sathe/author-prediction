something
quite
different.
The
Priory
keystone
if
this
was
indeed
what
they
were
holding
was
not
at
all
what
Langdon
had
imagined.
"The
Priory
keystone
is
not
my
specialty,"
Langdon
admitted.
"My
interest
in
the
Holy
Grail
is
primarily
symbologic,
so
I
tend
to
ignore
the
plethora
of
lore
regarding
how
to
actually
find
it."
Sophie's
eyebrows
arched.
"Find
the
Holy
Grail?"
Langdon
gave
an
uneasy
nod,
speaking
his
next
words
carefully.
"Sophie,
according

lore,
the

was
the
only
logical

he
could

An

hidden
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Rose.
The
idea
that
the
cryptex
had
been
designed
by
Leonardo
da
Vinci
former
Grand
Master
of
the
Priory
of
Sion
shone
as
another
tantalizing
indicator
that
this
was
indeed
the
Priory
keystone.
A
former
Grand
Master's
blueprint
brought
to
life
centuries
later
by
another
Priory
member.
The
bond
was
too
palpable
to
dismiss.
For

historians
