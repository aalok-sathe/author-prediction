began
to
stand
up
but
paused,
spying
the
small,
spent
pistol
shell
on
the
floor
beside
the
truck's
precision
crafted
doorsill.
"Stand
up,
and
step
away
from
the
box."
Langdon
paused
a
moment
longer,
eyeing
the
metal
threshold.
Then
he
stood.
As
he
did,
he
discreetly
brushed
the
shell
over
the
edge
onto
the
narrow
ledge
that
was
the
door's
lower
sill.
Fully
upright
now,
Langdon
stepped
backward.
"Return
to
the
back
wall
and
turn
around."
Langdon
obeyed.

Aiming
the
gun
with
his

was

too
heavy.

Turning
his
eyes
back
to
his
captives,
he
calculated
the
risk.
Both
were
a
good
fifteen
feet

at
the
far
end
of
the
cargo
hold,
facing
away
from
him.
Vernet
made
up
his
mind.
Quickly,
he
laid
down
the
gun
on
the
bumper,
lifted
the
box
with
two
hands,
and
set
it
on
the
ground,
immediately
grabbing
the
gun
again
and
aiming
it
back
into
the
hold.
Neither
of
his
prisoners
had
moved.
Perfect.
Now
all
that
remained
was
to
close
and
lock
the
door.
