flash
of
enlightenment
struck
him.
Langdon
set
down
his
empty
can
of
Coke
hard.
"You
won't
believe
this,"
he
said,
turning
to
the
others.
"The
Templar
headstone
I
figured
it
out."
Teabing's
eyes
turned
to
saucers.
"You
know
where
the
headstone
is?"
Langdon
smiled.
"Not
where
it
is.
What
it
is."
Sophie
leaned
in
to
hear.
"I
think
the
headstone
references
a
literal
stone
head,
"
Langdon
explained,
savoring
the
familiar
excitement
of
academic
breakthrough.
"Not
a
grave
marker."
"A
stone
head?"
Teabing
demanded.
Sophie
looked
equally
confused.

Langdon
said,
turning,
"during
the
Inquisition,
the
Church
accused
the
Knights
Templar
of
all
kinds
of
heresies,
right?"
"Correct.
They
fabricated
all
kinds
of
charges.
Sodomy,
urination
on
the
cross,
devil
worship,
quite
a
list."
"And
on
that
list
was
the
worship
of
false
idols,
right?
Specifically,
the
Church
accused
the
Templars
of
secretly
performing
rituals
in
which
they
prayed
to
a
carved
stone
head
the
pagan
god
"Baphomet!"
Teabing
blurted.
"My
heavens,
Robert,
you're
right!
A
headstone
praised
by
Templars!"
Langdon
quickly
explained
to
Sophie
that
Baphomet
was
a
pagan
fertility
god
associated
with
the
creative
force
of
reproduction.
Baphomet's
head
was
represented
as
that
of
a
ram
or
goat,
