but
as
they
embraced,
she
could
feel
the
power
of
the
blood
coursing
through
his
veins
the
blood
she
now
understood
they
shared.
When
Langdon
walked
across
the
lawn
to
join
them,
Sophie
could
not
imagine
that
only
yesterday
she
had
felt
so
alone
in
the
world.
And
now,
somehow,
in
this
foreign
place,
in
the
company

He
turned.
Sophie's
grandmother
emerged,
her
silver
hair
shimmering
in
the
night.
Her
name,
for
the
last
twenty
eight
years
at
least,
was
Marie
Chauvel.
Langdon
gave
a
tired
smile.
"I
thought
I'd

your
family
some
time

Through
the
window,
he
could
see
Sophie
talking
with
her
brother.
