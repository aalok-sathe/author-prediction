end
of
the
tunnel,
Langdon
followed
the
signs
for
the
that
blew
through
the
lone
pillared
wall
that
was
the
cloister's
only
source
of
light.
Another
couple
scurried
past
them
the
other
way,
hurrying
to
get
out
of
the
worsening
weather.
The
cloisters
looked
deserted
now,
admittedly
the
abbey's
least
enticing
section
in
the
wind
and
rain.
Forty
yards
down
the
east
cloister,
an
archway
materialized
on
their
left,
giving
way
to
another
hallway.
Although
this
was
the
entrance
they
were
looking
for,
the
opening
was
cordoned
off
by
a
swag
and
an
official
looking
sign.
CLOSED

RENOVATION
PYX
CHAMBER
ST.
FAITH'S
CHAPEL
The
long,
deserted
corridor
beyond
the
swag
was
littered
with
scaffolding
and
drop
cloths.
Immediately
beyond
the
swag,
Langdon
could
see
the
entrances
to
the
Pyx
Chamber
and
St.
Faith's
Chapel
on
the
right
and
left.
The
entrance
to
the
Chapter
House,
however,
was
much
farther
away,
at
the
far
end
of
the
long
hallway.
Even
from
here,
Langdon
could
see
that
its
heavy
wooden
door
was
wide
open,
and
the
spacious
octagonal
interior
was
bathed
in
a
grayish
natural
light
from
the
room's
enormous
windows
that
looked
out
on
College
Garden.
