of

customs
officials
at
the
receiving
airport."
Fache
checked
his
watch
and
gazed
out
at
the
scattering
of
jets
parked
in
front
of
the
terminal.
"If
they're
going
to
Biggin
Hill,
how
long
until
they
land?"
The
controller
fumbled
through
his
records.
"It's
a
short
flight.
His
plane
could
be
on
the
ground
by
around
six

from
now."
Fache
frowned
and
turned
to
one

a
transport
up

local
police.

British
MI5.

plane

"Just

she
replied.
"And
the
poem.
I
don't
know."
Langdon
was
feeling
the
same
way.
The
hum
of
the
engines
and
the
gentle
rocking
of
the
plane
were
hypnotic,
and
his
head
still
throbbed
where
he'd
been
hit
by
the
monk.
Teabing
was
still
in
the
back
of
the
plane,
and
Langdon
decided
to
take
advantage
of
the
moment
alone
with
Sophie
