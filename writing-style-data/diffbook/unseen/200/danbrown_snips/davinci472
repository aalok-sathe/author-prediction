to
tell
me
about
it?"
"I'd
rather
not."
She
turned
suddenly
back
to
Langdon,
her
eyes
welling
with
emotion.
"I
don't
know
what
I
saw."
"Were
both
men
and
women
present?"
After
a
beat,
she
nodded.
"Dressed
in
white
and
black?"
She
wiped
her
eyes
and
then
nodded,
seeming
to
open
up
a
little.
"The
women
were
in
white
gossamer
gowns
with
golden
shoes.
They
held
golden
orbs.
The
men
wore
black
tunics
and
black
shoes."
Langdon
strained
to
hide
his
emotion,
and
yet
he
could
not
believe
what
he
was
hearing.
Sophie
Neveu
had
unwittingly
witnessed
a
two
thousand
year
old
sacred
ceremony.
"Masks?"
he
asked,
keeping
his
voice
calm.
"Androgynous
masks?"
"Yes.
Everyone.
Identical
masks.
White
on
the
women.
Black
on
the
men."
Langdon
had
read
descriptions
of
this
ceremony
and
understood
its
mystic
roots.
"It's
called
Hieros
Gamos,"
he
said
softly.
"It
dates
back
more
than
two
thousand
years.
Egyptian
priests
and
priestesses
performed
it
regularly
to
celebrate
the
reproductive
power
of
the
female,"
He
paused,
leaning
toward
her.
"And
if
you
witnessed
Hieros
Gamos
without
being
properly
prepared
to
understand
its
meaning,
I
imagine
it
would
be
pretty
shocking."
Sophie
said
nothing.
"Hieros
Gamos
is
Greek,"
