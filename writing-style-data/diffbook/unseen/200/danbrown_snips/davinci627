that
you
delivered
it
into
my
waiting
hands
only
serves
as
proof
that
my
cause
is
just."
"What!"
Langdon
was
appalled.
"Silas
was
supposed
to
break
in
and
steal
the
keystone
from
you
in
Chateau
Villette
thus
removing
you
from
the
equation
without
hurting

and

Remy's
orders
had
been

while
Silas
recovers
the
keystone.
Unfortunately,
Langdon's
threat
to
smash
the
keystone
on
the
chapel
floor
had
caused
Remy
to
panic.
If
only
Remy
had
not
revealed
himself,
Teabing
thought
ruefully,
recalling
his
own
mock
kidnapping.
Remy
was
the
sole
link
to
me,
and
he
showed
his

Fortunately,
Silas
remained
unaware
of
Teabing's
true
identity
and
