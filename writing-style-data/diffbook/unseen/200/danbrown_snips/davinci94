knowing
about
it.
"I
need
to
return
to
Mr.
Sauniere's
office
for
a
moment,"
Fache
said.
"Please
come
find
me
directly,
Mr.
Langdon.
There
is
more
we
need
to
discuss."
Langdon
gave
a
quiet
wave
as
he
disappeared
into
the
darkness.
Turning,
Fache
marched
angrily
in
the
opposite
direction.
Arriving
at
the
gate,
he
slid
under,
exited
the
Grand
Gallery,
marched
down
the
hall,
and
stormed
into
the
command
center
at
Sauniere's
office.
"Who
gave
the
approval
to
let
Sophie
Neveu
into
this
building!"
Fache
bellowed.
Collet
was
the
first
to
answer.
"She
told
the
guards
outside
she'd
broken
the
code."
Fache
looked
around.
"Is
she
gone?"
"She's
not
with
you?"
"She
left."
Fache
glanced
out
at
the
darkened
hallway.
Apparently
Sophie
had
been
in
no
mood
to
stop
by
and
chat
with
the
other
officers
on
her
way
out.
For
a
moment,
Fache
considered
radioing
the
guards
in
the
entresol
and
telling
them
to
stop
Sophie
and
drag
her
back
up
here
before
she
could
leave
the
premises.
He
thought
better
of
it.
That
was
only
his
pride
talking
wanting
the
last
word.
He'd
had
enough
distractions
tonight.
Deal
with
Agent
Neveu
later,
he
told
himself,
already
looking
forward
