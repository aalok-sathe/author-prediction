quite
literally.
Many
of
you
use
his
textbooks
in
class."
The
students
in
the
crowd
nodded
enthusiastically.
"I
had
planned
to
introduce
him
tonight
by
sharing
his
impressive
curriculum
vitae.
However"
She
glanced
playfully
at
Langdon,
who
was
seated
onstage.
"An
audience
member
has
just
handed

She
held

goaded
the
crowd.
"Would
you
like
to
hear
more?"
The
crowd
applauded.
Somebody
stop
her,
Langdon
pleaded
as
she
dove
into
the
article
again.
"Although
Professor
Langdon
might
not
be
considered
hunk
handsome
like
some
of
our
younger
awardees,
this
forty
something
academic
has
more
than
his
share
of
scholarly
allure.

captivating
presence
is

speaking
voice,
