good
that
whoever
stepped
forward
to
take
the
keystone
could
be
the
enemy
himself.
For
the
moment,
at
least,
it
seemed
the
keystone
was
in
Sophie
and
Langdon's
hands,
whether
they
wanted
it
or
not.
The
truck's
front
end
looked
worse
than
Langdon
had
imagined.
The
left
headlight
was
gone,
and
the
right
one
looked
like
an
eyeball
dangling
from
its
socket.
Langdon
straightened
it,
and
it
dislodged
again.
The
only
good
news
was
that
the
front
bumper
had
been
torn
almost
clean
off.
Langdon
gave
it
a
hard
kick
and
sensed
he
might
be
able
to
break
it
off
entirely.
As
he
repeatedly
kicked
the
twisted
metal,
Langdon
recalled
his
earlier
conversation
with
Sophie.
My
grandfather
left
me
a
phone
message,
Sophie
had
told
him.
He
said
he
needed
to
tell
me
the
truth
about
my
family.
At
the
time
it
had
meant
nothing,
but
now,
knowing
the
Priory
of
Sion
was
involved,
Langdon
felt
a
startling
new
possibility
emerge.
The
bumper
broke
off
suddenly
with
a
crash.
Langdon
paused
to
catch
his
breath.
At
least
the
truck
would
no
longer
look
like
a
Fourth
of
July
sparkler.
He
grabbed
the
bumper
and
began
dragging
it
out
of
sight
