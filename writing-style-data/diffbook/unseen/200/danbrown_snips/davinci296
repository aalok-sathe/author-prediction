anywhere
near
the
clients.
You
need
to
go
in
and
ask
the
front
desk."
"Your
bank
is
demanding
a
search
warrant
before
we
can
enter."
Vernet
put
on
a
disgusted
look.
"Administrators.
Don't
get
me
started."
"Open
your
truck,
please."
Collet
motioned
toward
the
cargo
hold.
Vernet
stared
at
the
agent
and
forced
an
obnoxious
laugh.
"Open
the
truck?
You
think
I
have
keys?
You
think
they
trust
us?
You
should
see
the
crap
wages
I
get
paid."
The
agent's
head
tilted
to
one
side,
his
skepticism
evident.
"You're
telling
me
you
don't
have
keys
to
your
own
truck?"
Vernet
shook
his
head.
"Not
the
cargo

Ignition
only.
These
trucks
get
sealed
by
overseers
on
the
loading
dock.
Then
the
truck
sits
in
dock
while
someone
drives
the
cargo
keys
to
the
drop
off.
Once
we
get
the
call
that
the
cargo
keys
are
with
the
recipient,
then
I
get
the
okay
to
drive.
Not
a
second
before.
I
never
know
what
the
hell
I'm
lugging."
"When
was
this
truck
sealed?"
"Must
have
been
hours
ago.
I'm
driving
all
the
way
up
to
St.
Thurial
tonight.
Cargo
keys
are
already
up
there."
The
agent
made
no
response,
