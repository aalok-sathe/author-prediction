tossed
unceremoniously
into
the
Tiber
River.
But
this
poem
refers
to
a
tomb.
A
tomb
in
London.
And
there
are
few
knights
buried
in
London.

He
paused,
eyeing
Langdon
as
if
waiting
for
light
to
dawn.
Finally
he
huffed.
"Robert,
for
heaven's
sake!
The
church
built
in
London
by

"Actually,
it's

Fleet

Teabing
looked

"Thanks."
