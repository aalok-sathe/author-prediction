eternity!
The
chanting
grew
steady
again.
Accelerating.
Thundering
now.
Faster.
The
participants
stepped
inward
and
knelt.
In
that
instant,
Sophie
could
finally
see
what
they
were
all
watching.
On
a
low,
ornate
altar
in
the
center
of
the
circle
lay
a
man.
He
was
naked,
positioned
on
his
back,
and
wearing
a
black
mask.
Sophie
instantly
recognized
his
body
and
the
birthmark
on
his
shoulder.
She
almost
cried
out.
Grand
pere!
This
image
alone
would
have
shocked
Sophie
beyond
belief,
and
yet
there
was
more.
Straddling
her
grandfather
was
a
naked
woman
wearing
a
white
mask,
her
luxuriant
silver
hair
flowing
out
behind
it.
Her
body
was
plump,
far
from
perfect,
and
she
was
gyrating
in
rhythm
to
the
chanting
making
love
to
Sophie's
grandfather.
Sophie
wanted
to
turn
and
run,
but
she
couldn't.
The
stone
walls
of
the
grotto
imprisoned
her
as
the
chanting
rose
to
a
fever
pitch.
The
circle
of
participants
seemed
almost
to
be
singing
now,
the
noise
rising
in
crescendo
to
a
frenzy.
With
a
sudden
roar,
the
entire
room
seemed
to
erupt
in
climax.
Sophie
could
not
breathe.
She
suddenly
realized
she
was
quietly
sobbing.
She
turned
and
staggered
silently
up
the
stairs,
out
