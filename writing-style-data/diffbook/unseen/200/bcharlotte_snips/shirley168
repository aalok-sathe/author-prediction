so."
"You
are
always
vexed
when
you
are
asked
to
come
and
marry
a
couple.
Why?"
"Because
one
does
not
like
to
act
as
accessory
to
the
commission
of
a
piece
of
pure
folly."
Mr.
Helstone
spoke
so
readily,
he
seemed
rather
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
give
his
niece
a
piece
of
his
mind
on
this
point.
Emboldened
by
the
impunity
which
had
hitherto
attended
her
questions,
she
went
a
little
further.
"But

"should
it
be

folly?
If
two
people
like

Caroline's
next
remark;
it
was
a
sense
of
antipathy
to
such
opinions,
and
of
displeasure
at
him
who
held
them.
"One
would
think
you
had
never
been
married,
uncle.
One
would
think
you
were
an
old
bachelor."
"Practically,
I
am
so."
"But
you
have
been
married.
Why
were
you
so
inconsistent
as
to
marry?"
"Every
