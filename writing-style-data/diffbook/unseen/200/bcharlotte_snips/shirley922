was
expected.
His
family
and
Miss
Keeldar
were
assembled
in
the
oak
parlour.
Addressing
the
latter,
he
requested
her
to
step
with
him
into
another
room.
He
wished
to
have
with
her
a
"strictly
private
interview."
She
rose,
asking
no
questions
and
professing
no
surprise.
"Very
well,
sir,"
she
said,
in
the
tone
of
a
determined
person
who
is
informed
that
the
dentist
is
come
to
extract
that
large
double
tooth
of
his,
from
which
he
has
suffered
such
a
purgatory

month
past.
She

her
sewing
and

the
pair
took
seats,
each
in
an
arm
chair,
placed
opposite,
a
few
yards
between
them.
"I
have
been
to
De
Walden
Hall,"
said
Mr.
Sympson.
He
paused.
Miss
Keeldar's
eyes
were
on
the
pretty
white
and
green
carpet.
That
information
required
no
response.
She
gave
none.
"I
have
learned,"
he
went
on
slowly
"I
have
learned
a
circumstance
which
surprises
me."
Resting
her
cheek
on
her
forefinger,
she
waited
to
be
told
what
circumstance.
"It
seems
that
Nunnely
Priory
is
shut
up

the
family
are
gone
back
to
their
place
