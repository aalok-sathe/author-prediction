their
sepulchre
save
now
and
then
to
scare
Joe
Scott,
or
give
a
start
to
some
foreign
correspondent.
Indeed,
a
general
habit
of
reserve
on
whatever
was
important
seemed
bred
in
his
mercantile
blood.
Breakfast
over,
he
went
to
his
counting
house.
Henry,
Joe
Scott's
boy,
brought
in
the
letters
and
the
daily
papers;
Moore
seated
himself
at
his
desk,
broke
the
seals
of
the
documents,
and
glanced
them
over.
They
were
all
short,
but
not,
it
seemed,
sweet
probably
rather
sour,
on

However,
having

stripped
away
the
feathered
top
in
a
brief
spasm
of
finger
fury
(only
finger
fury
his
face
was
placid),
he
dashed
off
a
batch
of
answers,
sealed
them,
and
then
went
out
and
walked
through
the
mill.
On
coming
back
he
sat
down
to
read
his
newspaper.
The
contents
seemed
not
absorbingly
interesting;
he
