and
grateful
to
him,
looked,
as
she
touched
her
guitar,
almost
graceful,
almost
handsome;
her
everyday
fretful
look
was
gone
for
a
moment,
and
was
replaced
by
a
"sourire
plein
de
bonte."
She
sang
the
songs
he
asked
for,
with
feeling;
they
reminded
her
of
a
parent
to
whom
she
had
been
truly
attached;
they
reminded
her
of
her
young
days.
She
observed,
too,
that
Caroline
listened
with
naive
interest;
this
augmented
her
good
humour;
and
the
exclamation
at
the
close
of
the
song,
"I
wish
I
could
sing
and
play
like
Hortense!"
achieved
the
business,
and
rendered
her
charming
for
the
evening.
It
is
true
a
little
lecture
to
Caroline
followed,
on
the
vanity
of
wishing
and
the
duty
of
trying.
"As
Rome,"
it
was
suggested,
"had
not
been
built
in
a
day,
so
neither
had
Mademoiselle
Gerard
Moore's
education
been
completed
in
a
week,
or
by
merely
wishing
to
be
clever.
It
was
effort
that
had
accomplished
that
great
work.
She
was
ever
remarkable
for
her
perseverance,
for
her
industry.
Her
masters
had
remarked
that
it
was
as
delightful
as
it
was
uncommon
to
find
so
much
talent
united
with
so
much
solidity,
and
so
on."
