her
husband;
she
has
not
yet
found
out
that
he
is
hampered
by
a
secret
intrigue
which
prevents
him
from
marrying,
or
that
he
is
a
wolf
in
sheep's
clothing
discoveries
which
she
made
at
an
early
date
after
marriage
concerning
most
of
her
husband's
bachelor
friends,
and

and
whose
plain

occasions
is
carried
to
a
point
calculated,
sometimes,
to
awaken
admiration,
but
oftener
alarm
"pooh!
you
need
not
talk
