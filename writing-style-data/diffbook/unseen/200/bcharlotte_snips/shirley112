with
my
forming
hand
and
almost
motherly
care
she
may
improve.
There
is
about
her
an
occasional
something
a
reserve,
I
think
which
I
do
not
quite
like,
because
it
is
not
sufficiently
girlish
and
submissive;
and
there
are
glimpses
of
an
unsettled
hurry
in
her
nature,
which
put
me
out.
Yet
she
is
usually
most
tranquil,
too
dejected
and
thoughtful
indeed
sometimes.
In
time,
I
doubt
not,
I
shall
make
her
uniformly
sedate
and
decorous,
without
being
unaccountably
pensive.
I
ever
disapprove
what
is
not
intelligible."
"I
don't
understand
your
account
in

What
do
you
mean
by
'unsettled

for
instance?"
"An
example
will,
perhaps,
be
the
most
satisfactory
explanation.
I
sometimes,
you

make
her
read
French

She
has
in
the
course
of
her
lessons
gone
through
much
of
Corneille
and
Racine,
in
a
very
steady,
sober
spirit,
such
as
I
approve.
Occasionally
she
showed,
indeed,
a
degree
of
languor
in
the
perusal
of
those
esteemed
authors,
partaking
rather
of
apathy
than
sobriety;
and
apathy
is
what
I
cannot
tolerate
in
those
who
have
the
benefit
of
my
instructions
besides,
one
should
not
be
apathetic
