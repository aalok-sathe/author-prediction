shall
not
marry
Samuel
Fawthrop
Wynne."
"I
ask
why.
I
must
have
a
reason.
In
all
respects
he
is
more
than
worthy
of
you."
She
stood
on
the
hearth.
She
was
pale
as
the
white
marble
slab
and
cornice
behind
her;
her
eyes
flashed
large,
dilated,
unsmiling.
"And
I
ask
in
what
sense
that
young
man
is

me?"
"He
has
twice

is
a
second

block.
His
views
are
narrow,
his
feelings
are
blunt,
his
tastes
are
coarse,
his
manners
vulgar."
"The
man
is
a
respectable,
wealthy

To
refuse
him
is
presumption
on
your
part."
"I
refuse
point

Cease
to
annoy
me
with
the
subject;
I
forbid
it!"
"Is

your
intention
ever
to
marry;
or
do
you
prefer
celibacy?"
"I
