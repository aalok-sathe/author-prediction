man
just
the
height
of
Robert.
For
one
second
she
thought
it
was
Robert
for
one
second
she
exulted;
but
the
voice
asking
for
Mr.
Helstone
undeceived
her.
That
voice
was
an
Irish
voice,
consequently
not
Moore's,
but
the
curate's
Malone's.
He
was
ushered
into
the
dining
room,
where,
doubtless,
he
speedily
helped
his
rector
to
empty
the
decanters.
It
was
a
fact
to
be
noted,
that
at
whatever
house
in
Briarfield,
Whinbury,
or
Nunnely
one
curate
dropped
in
to
a
meal
dinner
or
tea,
as,
the
case
might
be
another
presently
followed,
often
two
more.
Not
that
they
gave
each
other
the
rendezvous,
but
they
were
usually
all
on
the
run
at
the
same
time;
and
when
Donne,
for
instance,
sought
Malone
at
his
lodgings
and
found
him
not,
he
inquired
whither
he
had
posted,
and
having
learned
of
the
landlady
his
destination,
hastened
with
all
speed
after
him.
The
same
causes
operated
in
the
same
way
with
Sweeting.
Thus
it
chanced
on
that
afternoon
that
Caroline's
ears
were
three
times
tortured
with
the
ringing
of
the
bell
and
the
advent
of
undesired
guests;
for
Donne
followed
Malone,
and
Sweeting
followed
Donne;
and
more
wine
was
ordered
up
from
