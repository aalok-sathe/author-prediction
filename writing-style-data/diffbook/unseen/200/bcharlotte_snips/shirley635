cheerful;
with
her,
at
times,
she
was
tender;
to
her
she
would
impart
her
knowledge,
reveal
glimpses
of
her
experience,
give
her
opportunities
for
guessing
what
life
she
had
lived,
what
cultivation
her
mind
had
received,
of
what
calibre
was
her
intelligence,
how
and
where
her
feelings
were
vulnerable.
To
day,
for
instance,
as
they
walked
along,
Mrs.
Pryor
talked
to
her
companion
about
the
various
birds
singing
in
the
trees,

It
appeared
that
she
had
minutely
studied
the
botany
of
English
fields
and
woods.
Having
reached
the
head
of
the
ravine,
they
sat
down
together
on
a
ledge
of
gray
and
mossy
rock
jutting
from
the
base
of
a
steep
green
hill
which
towered
above
them.
She
looked
round
her,
and
spoke
of
the
neighbourhood
as
she
had
once
before
seen

She
alluded
