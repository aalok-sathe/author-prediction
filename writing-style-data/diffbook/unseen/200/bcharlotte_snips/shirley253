and
neither
father
nor
mother
have
a
spirit
to
compare
with
it.
Partaking
of
the
essence
of
each,
it
will
one
day
be
better
than
either
stronger,
much
purer,
more
aspiring.
Rose
is
a
still,
sometimes
a
stubborn,
girl
now.
Her
mother
wants
to
make
of
her
such
a
woman
as
she
is
herself
a
woman
of
dark
and
dreary
duties;
and
Rose
has
a
mind
full
set,
thick
sown
with
the
germs
of
ideas
her
mother
never
knew.
It
is
agony
to
her
often
to
have
these
ideas
trampled
on
and
repressed.
She
has
never
rebelled
yet;
but
if
hard
driven,
she
will
rebel
one
day,
and
then
it
will
be
once
for
all.
Rose
loves
her
father:
her
father
does
not
rule
her
with
a
rod
of
iron;
he
is
good
to
her.
He
sometimes
fears
she
will
not
live,
so
bright
are
the
sparks
of
intelligence
which,
at
moments,
flash
from
her
glance
and
gleam
in
her
language.
This
idea
makes
him
often
sadly
tender
to
her.
He
has
no
idea
that
little
Jessy
will
die
young,
she
is
so
gay
and
chattering,
arch,
original
even
now;
passionate
when
provoked,
but
most
affectionate
if
caressed;
by
turns
