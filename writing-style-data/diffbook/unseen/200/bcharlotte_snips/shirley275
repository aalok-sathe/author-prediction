fellow,"
he
added,
standing
up
at
the
table,
and
pointing
across
it
to
Matthew
"this
fellow
forgets,
what
every
cottier
in
Briarfield
knows,
that
all
born
of
our
house
have
that
arched
instep
under
which
water
can
flow
proof
that
there
has
not
been
a
slave
of
the
blood
for
three
hundred
years."
"Mountebank!"
said
Matthew.
"Lads,
be
silent!"
exclaimed
Mr.
Yorke.
"Martin,
you
are
a
mischief
maker.
There
would
have
been
no
disturbance
but
for
you."
"Indeed!
Is
that
correct?
Did
I
begin,
or
did
Matthew?
Had
I
spoken
to
him
when
he
accused
me
of
gabbling
like
a
fool?"
"A
presumptuous
fool!"
repeated
Matthew.
Here
Mrs.
Yorke
commenced
rocking
herself
rather
a
portentous
movement
with
her,
as
it
was
occasionally
followed,
especially
when
Matthew
was
worsted
in
a
conflict,
by
a
fit
of
hysterics.
"I
don't
see
why
I
should
bear
insolence
from
Matthew
Yorke,
or
what
right
he
has
to
use
bad
language
to
me,"
observed
Martin.
"He
has
no
right,
my
lad;
but
forgive
your
brother
until
seventy
and
seven
times,"
said
Mr.
Yorke
soothingly.
"Always
alike,
and
theory
and
practice
always
adverse!"
murmured
Martin
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
room.
"Where
art
thou
going,
