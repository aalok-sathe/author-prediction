back
on
her
pillow.
Mrs.
Pryor
found
means
to
steal
quietly
from
the
room.
She
re
entered
it
soon
after,
apparently
as
composed
as
if
she
had
really
not
overheard
this
strange
soliloquy.
The
next
day
several
callers
came.
It
had
become
known
that
Miss
Helstone
was
worse.
Mr.
Hall
and

"Left!
Is
he

from
home?"
It
was
then
explained
that
some

intelligence
about
the
rioters

Birmingham,
and
probably

ere
he
returned.
"He
is
not

Miss
Helstone

"Oh
