for
the
wood.
It
was
yet
but
half
past
three.
It
had
been
a
fine
morning,
but
the
sky
looked
dark
now.
It
was
beginning
to
snow;
the
wind
blew
cold;
the
wood
looked
dismal,
the
old
tree
grim.
Yet
Martin
approved
the
shadow
on
his
path.
He
found
a
charm
in
the
spectral
aspect
of
the
doddered
oak.
He
had
to
wait.
To
and
fro
he
walked,
while
the
flakes
fell
faster;
and
the
wind,
which
at
first
had
but
moaned,
pitifully
howled.
"She

power."
He
continued
his
walk.
"Now,"
he
resumed,
when
a
further
period
had
elapsed,
"if
she
fails
to
come,
I
shall
hate
and
scorn
her."
It
struck
four.
He
heard
the
church
clock
far
away.
A
step
so
quick,
so
light,
that,
but
for
the
rustling
of
leaves,
it
would
scarcely
have
sounded
on
the
wood
walk,
checked
his
impatience.
The
wind
blew
fiercely
now,
