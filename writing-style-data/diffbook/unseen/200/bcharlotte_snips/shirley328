one.
A
doctor
could
do
me
no
good.
I
merely
want
change
of
air
and
scene."
"Well,
if
that
be
the
caprice,
it
shall
be
gratified.
You
shall
go
to
a
watering
place.
I
don't
mind
the
expense.
Fanny
shall
accompany
you."
"But,
uncle,
some
day
I
must
do
something
for
myself;
I
have
no
fortune.
I
had
better
begin
now."
"While
I
live,
you
shall
not
turn
out
as
a
governess,
Caroline.
I
will
not
have
it
said
that
my
niece
is
a
governess."
"But
the
later
in
life
one
makes
a
change
of
that
sort,
uncle,
the
more
difficult
and
painful
it
is.
I
should
wish
to
get
accustomed
to
the
yoke
before
any
habits
of
ease
and
independence
are
formed."
"I
beg
you
will
not
harass
me,
Caroline.
I
mean
to
provide
for
you.
I
have
always
meant
to
provide
for
you.
I
will
purchase
an
annuity.
Bless
me!
I
am
but
fifty
five;
my
health
and
constitution
are
excellent.
There
is
plenty
of
time
to
save
and
take
measures.
Don't
make
yourself
anxious
respecting
the
future.
Is
that
what
frets
you?"
"No,
uncle;
but
I
long
for
a
change."
He
laughed.
"There
speaks
the
woman!"
