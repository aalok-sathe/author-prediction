being
utterly
alone
for
she
had
lost
all
trace
of
her
tribe,
who
had
wandered
leagues
away,
she
knew
not
where
she
went
up
from
the
vale,
to
watch
Day
take
leave
and
Night
arrive.
A
crag
overspread
by
a
tree
was
her
station.
The
oak
roots,
turfed
and
mossed,
gave
a
seat;
the
oak
boughs,
thick
leaved,
wove
a
canopy.
Slow
and
grand
the
Day
withdrew,
passing
in
purple
fire,
and
parting
to
the
farewell
of
a
wild,
low
chorus
from
the
woodlands.
Then
Night
entered,
quiet
as
death.
The
wind
fell,
the
birds
ceased
singing.
Now
every
nest
held
happy
mates,
and
hart
and
hind
slumbered
blissfully
safe
in
their
lair.
The
girl
sat,
her
body
still,
her
soul
astir;
occupied,
however,
rather
in
feeling
than
in
thinking,
in
wishing
than
hoping,
in
imagining
than
projecting.
She
felt
the
world,
the
sky,
the
night,
boundlessly
mighty.
Of
all
things
herself
seemed
to
herself
the
centre
a
small,
forgotten
atom
of
life,
a
spark
of
soul,
emitted
inadvertent
from
the
great
creative
source,
and
now
burning
unmarked
to
waste
in
the
heart
of
a
black
hollow.
She
asked,
was
she
thus
to
burn
out
and
perish,
her
living
light
