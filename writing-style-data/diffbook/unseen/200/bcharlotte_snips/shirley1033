tone
distinct,
round,
and
deep.
"'Still,
I
know
I
shall
be
strangely
placed
with
that
mountain
nymph
Liberty.
She
is,
I
suspect,
akin
to
that
Solitude
which
I
once
wooed,
and
from
which
I
now
seek
a
divorce.
These
Oreads
are
peculiar.
They
come
upon
you
with
an
unearthly
charm,
like
some
starlight
evening;
they
inspire
a
wild
but
not

cannot
live

abstractions.
You,
Miss
Keeldar,
have
sometimes,
in
your
laughing
satire,
called
me
a
material
philosopher,
and
implied
that
I
live
sufficiently
for
the
substantial.
Certainly
I
feel
material
from
head
to
foot;
and
glorious
as
Nature
is,
and
deeply
as
I
worship
her
with
the
solid
powers
of
a
solid
heart,
I
would
rather
behold
her

the
soft
human
eyes
