day.
He
looked
a
little
grave
about
what
had
taken
place
in
Royd
Lane,
and
she
tried
to
smile
him
out
of
his
seriousness.
Miss
Keeldar
sat
near
for
a
wonder,
neither
laughing
nor
talking;
on
the
contrary,
very
still,
and
gazing
round
her
vigilantly.
She
seemed
afraid
lest
some
intruder
should
take
a
seat
she
apparently
wished
to
reserve
next
her
own.
Ever
and

spread
her
satin
dress
over
an

embroidered
handkerchief

often
characterized
her
tones
when
what
she
said
tended
even
remotely
to
stir
some
sweet
secret
source
of
feeling
in
her
heart,
"I
expect
Mr.
Moore.
I
saw
him
last
night,
and
I
made
him
promise
to
come
with
his
sister,
and
to
sit
at
our
table.
He
won't
fail
me,
I
feel
certain;
but
I
apprehend
his
coming
too
late,
and
being
separated
from
us.
Here
is
a
fresh
batch
arriving;
