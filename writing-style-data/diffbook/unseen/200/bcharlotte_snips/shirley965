thought.
If
she
behaves
well,
and
continues
to
suit
me
as
she
has
suited
me
to
day,
I
may
do
her
a
good
turn.
I
rather
relish
the
notion
of
circumventing
my
mother
and
that
ogress
old
Horsfall.
Not
that

advisable
that,

to
the
grammar
school
with
Mark,
he
should
succeed
to
his
father's
arm
chair
by
the
fireside,
and
also
to
his
morning
paper.
This
point
being
satisfactorily
settled,
and
Mark
being
gone
to
Mr.
Summer's
class,
and
Matthew
and
Mr.
Yorke
withdrawn
to
the
counting
house,
three
other
exploits
nay,
four
remained
to
be
achieved.
The
first
of
these
was
to
realize
the
breakfast
he
had
not
yet
tasted,
and
with
which
his
appetite
of
fifteen
could
