her
plans
conscientiously,
perseveringly.
It
was
very
hard
work
at
first
it
was
even
hard
work
to
the
end
but
it
helped
her
to
stem
and
keep
down
anguish;
it
forced
her
to
be
employed;
it
forbade
her
to
brood;
and
gleams
of
satisfaction
chequered
her
gray
life
here
and
there
when
she
found
she
had
done
good,
imparted
pleasure,
or
allayed
suffering.
Yet
I
must
speak
truth.
These
efforts
brought
her
neither
health
of
body
nor
continued
peace
of
mind.
With
them
all
she
wasted,
grew
more
joyless
and
more
wan;
with
them
all
her
memory
kept
harping
on
the
name
of
Robert
Moore;
an
elegy
over
the
past
still
rung
constantly
in
her
ear;
a
funereal
inward
cry
haunted
and
harassed
her;
the
heaviness
of
a
broken
spirit,
and
of
pining
and
palsying
faculties,
settled
slow
on
her
buoyant
youth.
Winter
seemed
conquering
her
spring;
the
mind's
soil
and
its
treasures
were
freezing
gradually
to
barren
stagnation.
Yet
Caroline
refused
tamely
to
succumb.
She
had
native
strength
in
her
girl's
heart,
and
she
used
it.
Men
and
women
never
struggle
so
hard
as
when
they
struggle
alone,
without
witness,
counsellor,
or
confidant,
unencouraged,
unadvised,
and
unpitied.
