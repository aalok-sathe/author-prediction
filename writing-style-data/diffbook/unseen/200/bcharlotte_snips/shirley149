would
be
pleasant
to
go
back
to
the
past,
to
hear
people
that
have
slept
for
generations
in
graves
that
are
perhaps
no
longer
graves
now,
but
gardens
and
fields,
speak
to
us
and
tell
us
their
thoughts,
and
impart
their
ideas."
"Who
shall
be
the
speaker?
What
language
shall
he
utter?
French?"
"Your
French
forefathers
don't
speak
so
sweetly,
nor
so
solemnly,
nor
so
impressively
as
your
English
ancestors,
Robert.
To
night
you
shall
be
entirely
English.
You
shall
read

English
book."
"An
old
English
book?"
"Yes,
an
old
English
book
one
that
you

and
I
will
choose

of
it
that
is
toned
quite
in
harmony
with
something
in
you.
It
shall
waken
your
nature,
fill
your
mind
with
music;
it
shall
pass
like
a
skilful
hand
over
your
heart,
and
make
its
strings
sound.
Your
heart
is
a
lyre,
Robert;
but
the
lot
of
your
life
has
not
been
a
minstrel
to
sweep
it,
and
it
is
often
silent.
Let
glorious
William
come
near
and
touch
it.
You
will
see
how
he
will
draw
the
English
power
and
melody
out
of
its
chords."
"I
must
read
Shakespeare?"
"You
must
have
his
spirit
before
you;
