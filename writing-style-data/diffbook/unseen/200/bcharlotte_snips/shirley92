"Sir,"
said
Mr.
Helstone,
collecting
all
his
dignity
"sir,
the
great
knowledge
of
man
is
to
know
himself,
and
the
bourne
whither
his

steps

"Ay,
ay.
You'll
recollect,
Mr.
Helstone,
that
Ignorance
was
carried
away
from

as
well

to
the

the
merits
of
such
an
encounter,

sufficiently
blackballed
each
