the
Establishment
is
indeed
in
a
poor
way,
and
both
she
and
her
sons
appear
in
the
utmost
need
of
reformation.
Turning
away
distressed
from
minster
tower
and
village
spire
ay,
as
distressed
as
a
churchwarden
who
feels
the
exigence
of
white
wash
and
has
not
wherewithal
to
purchase
lime
I
recall
your
senseless
sarcasms
on
the
'fat
bishops,'
the
'pampered
parsons,'
'old
mother
church,'
etc.
I
remember
your
strictures
on
all
who
differ
from
you,
your
sweeping
condemnation
of
classes
and
individuals,
without
the
slightest
allowance
made
for
circumstances
or
temptations;
and
then,
Mr.
Yorke,
doubt
clutches
my
inmost
heart
as
to
whether
men
exist
clement,
reasonable,
and
just
enough
to
be
entrusted
with
the
task
of
reform.
I
don't
believe
you
are
of
the
number."
"You
have
an
ill
opinion
of
me,
Miss
Shirley.
You
never
told
me
so
much
of
your
mind
before."
"I
never
had
an
opening.
But
I
have
sat
on
Jessy's
stool
by
your
chair
in
the
back
parlour
at
Briarmains,
for
evenings
together,
listening
excitedly
to
your
talk,
half
admiring
what
you
said,
and
half
rebelling
against
it.
I
think
you
a
fine
old
Yorkshireman,
sir.
I
am
proud
to
have
been
born
