he
"could
wish
Mr.
Moore
to
take
a
bit
of
a
walk
up
th'
Hollow.
It
would
do
him
good."
At
this
recommendation
Mr.
Moore
burst
into
a
short
laugh,
and
after
demanding
of
Joe
what
all
this
solicitude
meant,
and
whether
he
took
him
for
a
woman
or
a
child,
seized
the
keys
from
his
hand,
and
shoved
him
by
the
shoulders
out
of
his
presence.
He
called
him
back,
however,
ere
he

Ye'd
see
yoursel'

William's
sorely
changed
fair

They've
selled
most

"He
was
not
a
bad
workman?"
"Ye
never
had
a
better,
sir,
sin'
ye
began
trade."
"And
decent
people
the
whole
family?"
"Niver
dacenter.
Th'
wife's
a
raight
cant
body,
and
as
clean
ye
mught
eat
your
porridge
off
th'
house
floor.
They're
sorely
comed
down.
I
wish
William
could
get
a
job
as
gardener
or
summat
i'
that
way;
he
understands
gardening

wi'

Scotchman
