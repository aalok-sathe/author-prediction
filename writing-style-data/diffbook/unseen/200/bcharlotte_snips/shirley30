regret
extremely
Mr.
Helstone
should
have
thought
it
necessary
to
trouble
you
so
far.
There
was
no
necessity
I
told
him
so
and
on
such
a
night;
but
walk
forwards."
Through
a
dark
apartment,
of
aspect
undistinguishable,
Malone
followed
the
speaker
into
a
light
and
bright
room
within
very
light
and
bright
indeed
it
seemed
to
eyes
which,
for
the
last
hour,
had
been
striving
to
penetrate
the
double
darkness
of
night
and
fog;
but
except
for
its
excellent
fire,
and
for
a
lamp
of
elegant
design
and
vivid
lustre
burning
on
a
table,
it
was
a
very
plain
place.
The
boarded
floor
was
carpetless;
the
three
or
four
stiff
backed,
green
painted
chairs
seemed
once
to
have
furnished
the
kitchen
of
some
farm
house;
a
desk
of
strong,
solid
formation,
the
table
aforesaid,
and
some
framed
sheets
on
the
stone
coloured
walls,
bearing
plans
for
building,
for
gardening,
designs
of
machinery,
etc.,
completed
the
furniture
of
the
place.
Plain
as
it
was,
it
seemed
to
satisfy
Malone,
who,
when
he
had
removed
and
hung
up
his
wet
surtout
and
hat,
drew
one
of
the
rheumatic
looking
chairs
to
the
hearth,
and
set
his
knees
almost
within
the
bars
of
