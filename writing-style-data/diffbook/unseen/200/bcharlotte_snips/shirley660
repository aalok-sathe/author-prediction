table
when
you
read."
"I
will
try,
ma'am,
some
time;
but
it
is
so
comfortable
to
do
as
one
has
always
been
accustomed
to
do."
"My
dear,
let
me
beg
of
you
to
put
that
book
down.
You
are
trying
your
eyes
by
the
doubtful
firelight."
"No,
ma'am,
not
at
all;
my
eyes
are
never
tired."
At
last,
however,
a
pale
light
falls
on
the
page
from
the
window.
She
looks;
the
moon
is
up.
She
closes
the
volume,
rises,
and
walks
through
the
room.
Her
book
has
perhaps
been
a
good
one;
it
has
refreshed,
refilled,
rewarmed
her
heart;
it
has
set
her
brain
astir,
furnished
her
mind
with
pictures.
The
still
parlour,
the
clean
hearth,
the
window
opening
on
the
twilight
sky,
and
showing
its
"sweet
regent,"
new
throned
and
glorious,
suffice
to
make
earth
an
Eden,
life
a
poem,
for
Shirley.
A
still,
deep,
inborn
delight
glows
in
her
young
veins,
unmingled,
untroubled,
not
to
be
reached
or
ravished
by
human
agency,
because
by
no
human
agency
bestowed
the
pure
gift
of
God
to
His
creature,
the
free
dower
of
Nature
to
her
child.
This
joy
gives
her
experience
of
a
genii
life.
Buoyant,
by
green
steps,
