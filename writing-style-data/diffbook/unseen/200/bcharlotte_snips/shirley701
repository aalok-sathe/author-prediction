tying
it
over
her
black
apron,
rushed
eperdue
into
the
kitchen,
whence,
to
speak
truth,
exhaled
an
odour
of
calcined
sweets
rather
strong
than
savoury.
The
mistress
and
maid
had
been
in
full
feud
the
whole
day,
on
the
subject
of
preserving
certain
black
cherries,
hard
as
marbles,
sour
as
sloes.
Sarah
held
that
sugar
was
the
only
orthodox
condiment
to
be
used
in
that
process;
mademoiselle
maintained
and
proved
it
by
the
practice
and
experience
of
her
mother,
grandmother,
and
great
grandmother
that
treacle,
"melasse,"
was
infinitely
preferable.
She
had
committed
an
imprudence
in
leaving
Sarah
in
charge
of
the
preserving
pan,
for
her
want
of
sympathy
in
the
nature
of
its
contents
had
induced
a
degree
of
carelessness
in
watching
their
confection,
whereof
the
result
was
dark
and
cindery
ruin.
Hubbub
followed;
high
upbraiding,
and
sobs
rather
loud
than
deep
or
real.
Caroline,
once
more
turning
to
the
little
mirror,
was
shading
her
ringlets
from
her
cheek
to
smooth
them
under
her
cottage
bonnet,
certain
that
it
would
not
only
be
useless
but
unpleasant
to
stay
longer,
when,
on
the
sudden
opening
of
the
back
door,
there
fell
an
abrupt
calm
in
the
kitchen.
The
tongues
were
checked,
