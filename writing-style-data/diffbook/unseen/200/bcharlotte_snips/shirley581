moving
mass.
The
rioters
were
assembled
in
front
of
the
closed
yard
gates,
and
a
single
figure
stood
within,
apparently
addressing
them.
The
mill
itself
was
perfectly
black
and
still.
There
was
neither
life,
light,
nor
motion
around
it.
"Surely
he
is
prepared.
Surely
that
is
not
Moore
meeting
them
alone?"
whispered
Shirley.
"It
is.
We
must
go
to
him.
I
will
go
to
him."
"That
you
will
not."
"Why
did
I
come,
then?
I
came
only
for
him.
I
shall
join
him."
"Fortunately
it
is
out
of
your
power.
There
is
no
entrance
to
the
yard."
"There
is
a
small
entrance
at
the
back,
besides
the
gates
in
front.
It
opens
by
a
secret
method
which
I
know.
I
will
try
it."
"Not
with
my
leave."
Miss
Keeldar
clasped
her
round
the
waist
with
both
arms
and
held
her
back.
"Not
one
step
shall
you
stir,"
she
went
on
authoritatively.
"At
this
moment
Moore
would
be
both
shocked
and
embarrassed
if
he
saw
either
you
or
me.
Men
never
want
women
near
them
in
time
of
real
danger."
"I
would
not
trouble
I
would
help
him,"
was
the
reply.
"How?
by
inspiring
him
with
heroism?
Pooh!
these
are
not
