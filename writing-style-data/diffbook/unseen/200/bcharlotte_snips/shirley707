the
fine
traits
of
his
brother.
He
had
her
mould
of
mouth
and
chin
all
less
decisive,
accurate,
and
clear
than
those
of
the
young
mill
owner.
His
air,
though
deliberate
and
reflective,
could
scarcely
be
called
prompt
and
acute.
You
felt,
in
sitting
near
and
looking
up
at
him,
that
a
slower
and
probably
a
more
benignant
nature
than
that
of
the
elder
Moore
shed
calm
on
your
impressions.
Robert
perhaps
aware
that
Caroline's
glance
had
wandered
towards
and
dwelt
upon
him,
though
he
had
neither
met
nor
answered
it
put
down
the
book
of
engravings,
and
approaching,
took
a
seat
at
her
side.
She
resumed
her
conversation
with
Louis,
but
while
she
talked
to
him
her
thoughts
were
elsewhere.
Her
heart
beat
on
the
side
from
which
her
face
was
half
averted.
She
acknowledged
a
steady,
manly,
kindly
air
in
Louis;
but
she
bent
before
the
secret
power
of
Robert.
To
be
so
near
him
though
he
was
silent,
though
he
did
not
touch
so
much
as
her
scarf
fringe
or
the
white
hem
of
her
dress
affected
her
like
a
spell.
Had
she
been
obliged
to
speak
to
him
only,
it
would
have
quelled,
but,
at
liberty
