on
the
possession
of
these
qualities
she
peculiarly
piqued
herself.
"You
never
plotted
to
win
a
husband,
I'll
be
bound,"
pursued
Mrs.
Yorke;
"and
you
have
not
the
benefit
of
previous
experience
to
aid
you
in
discovering
when
others
plot."
Caroline
felt
this
kind
language
where
the
benevolent
speaker
intended
she
should
feel
it
in
her
very
heart.
She
could
not
even
parry
the
shafts;
she
was
defenceless
for
the
present.
To
answer
would
have
been
to
avow
that
the
cap
fitted.
Mrs.
Yorke,
looking
at
her
as
she
sat
with
troubled,
downcast
eyes,
and
cheek
burning
painfully,
and
figure
expressing
in
its
bent
attitude
and
unconscious
tremor
all
the
humiliation
and
chagrin
she
experienced,
felt
the
sufferer
was
fair
game.
The
strange
woman
had
a
natural
antipathy
to
a
shrinking,
sensitive
character
a
nervous
temperament;
nor
was
a
pretty,
delicate,
and
youthful
face
a
passport
to
her
affections.
It
was
seldom
she
met
with
all
these
obnoxious
qualities
combined
in
one
individual;
still
more
seldom
she
found
that
individual
at
her
mercy,
under
circumstances
in
which
she
could
crush
her
well.
She
happened
this
afternoon
to
be
specially
bilious
and
morose
as
much
disposed
to
gore
as
any
vicious
