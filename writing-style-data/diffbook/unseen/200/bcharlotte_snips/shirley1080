is
not
at
all
interfering,
and
incapable
of
gossip."
"I
know
her,
Cary.
But
if,
instead
of
being
the
personification
of
reserve
and
discretion,
she
were
something
quite
opposite,
I
should
not
fear
her."
"Yet
she
will
be
your
mother
in
law?"
The
speaker
gave
an
arch
little
nod.
Moore
smiled.
"Louis
and
I
are
not
of
the
order
of
men
who
fear
their
mothers
in
law,
Cary.
Our
foes
never
have
been,
nor
will
be,
those
of
our
own
household.
I
doubt
not
my
mother
in
law
will
make
much
of
me."
"That
she
will
in
her
quiet
way,
you
know.
She
is
not
demonstrative;
and
when
you
see
her
silent,
or
even
cool,
you
must
not
fancy
her
displeased;
it
is
only
a
manner
she
has.
Be
sure
to
let
me
interpret
for
her
whenever
she
puzzles
you;
always
believe
my
account
of
the
matter,
Robert."
"Oh,
implicitly!
Jesting
apart,
I
feel
that
she
and
I
will
suit
on
ne
peut
mieux.
Hortense,
you
know,
is
exquisitely
susceptible
in
our
French
sense
of
the
word
and
not,
perhaps,
always
reasonable
in
her
requirements;
yet,
dear,
honest
girl,
I
never
painfully
wounded
her
feelings
or
had
a
serious
quarrel
