them.
In
Antwerp
I
was
always
treated
with
distinction;
here,
one
would
think
that
when
I
open
my
lips
in
company
I
speak
English
with
a
ridiculous
accent,
whereas
I
am
quite
assured
that
I
pronounce
it
perfectly."
"Hortense,
in
Antwerp
we
were
known
rich;
in
England
we
were
never
known
but
poor."
"Precisely,
and
thus
mercenary
are
mankind.
Again,
dear
brother,
last
Sunday,
if
you
recollect,
was
very
wet;
accordingly
I
went
to
church
in
my
neat
black
sabots,
objects
one
would
not
indeed
wear
in
a
fashionable
city,
but
which
in
the
country
I
have
ever
been
accustomed
to
use
for
walking
in
dirty
roads.
Believe
me,
as
I
paced
up
the
aisle,
composed
and
tranquil,
as
I
am
always,
four
ladies,
and
as
many
gentlemen,
laughed
and
hid
their
faces
behind
their
prayer
books."
"Well,
well!
don't
put
on
the
sabots
again.
I
told
you
before
I
thought
they
were
not
quite
the
thing
for
this
country."
"But,
brother,
they
are
not
common
sabots,
such
as
the
peasantry
wear.
I
tell
you,
they
are
sabots
noirs,
tres
propres,
tres
convenables.
