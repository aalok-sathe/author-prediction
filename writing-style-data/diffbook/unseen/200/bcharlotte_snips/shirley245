mysteries

craft,
as
they
say."
"Now,
then,
you
can
go,
Joe.
You
need
not
stand
there
staring
at
me."
"Ye've
no
orders
to
give,
sir?"
"None,
but
for
you
to
take
yourself
off."
Which
Joe
did
accordingly.
Spring
evenings
are
often
cold
and
raw,
and
though
this
had
been
a
fine
day,
warm
even
in
the
morning
and
meridian
sunshine,
the
air
chilled
at
sunset,
the
ground
crisped,
and
ere
dusk
a
hoar
frost
was
insidiously
stealing
over
growing
grass
and
unfolding
bud.
It
whitened
the
pavement
in

Briarmains
(Mr.

and
broad

which
guarded
the
gable
nearest
the
road,
it
seemed
to
defy
a
spring
night
frost
to
harm
its
still
bare
boughs;
and
so
did
the
leafless
grove
of
walnut
trees
rising
tall
behind
the
house.
In
the
dusk
of
the
moonless
if
starry
night,
lights
from
windows
shone
vividly.
This
was
no
dark
or
lonely
scene,
nor
even
a
silent
one.
Briarmains
stood
near
the
highway.
It
was
rather
an
old
place,
and
