used
probably
in
being
made
to
believe
that
truth
which
was
falsehood.
She
is
not
complaining,
but
she
is
sitting
alone
in
the
snowstorm,
and
you
hear
her
thoughts.
They
are
not
the
thoughts
of
a
model
heroine
under
her
circumstances,
but
they
are
those
of
a
deeply
feeling,
strongly
resentful
peasant
girl.
Anguish
has
driven
her
from
the
ingle
nook
of
home
to
the
white
shrouded
and
icy
hills.
Crouched
under
the
"cauld
drift,"
she
recalls
every
image
of
horror
"the
yellow
wymed
ask,"
"the
hairy
adder,"
"the
auld
moon
bowing
tyke,"
"the
ghaist
at
e'en,",
"the
sour
bullister,"
"the
milk
on
the
taed's
back."
She
hates
these,
but
"waur
she
hates
Robin
a
Ree."
"Oh,
ance
I
lived
happily
by
yon
bonny
burn
The
warld
was
in
love
wi'
me;
But
now
I
maun
sit
'neath
the
cauld
drift
and
mourn,
And
curse
black
Robin
a
Ree!
"Then
whudder
awa,
thou
bitter
biting
blast,
And
sough
through
the
scrunty
tree,
And
smoor
me
up
in
the
snaw
fu'
fast,
And
n'er
let
the
sun
me
see!
"Oh,
never
melt
awa,
thou
wreath
o'
snaw,
That's
sae
kind
in
graving
me;
But
hide
me
frae
the
scorn
and
guffaw
