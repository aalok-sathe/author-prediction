rose

which
bloomed
in
a
quiet
green
nook
at
the
back
of
the
house.
This
plant
had
received
the
refreshing
shower;
she
was
now
resting
a
minute.
Near
the
wall
stood
a
fragment
of
sculptured
stone
a
monkish
relic
once,
perhaps,
the
base
of
a
cross.
She
mounted
it,
that
she
might
better
command
the

She

the
fires
looked
soft,
their
red
flame
bright.
Above
them,
in
the
sky
whence
the
sun
had
vanished,
twinkled
a
silver
point
the
star
of
love.
Caroline
was
not
unhappy
that
evening
far

but
as
she
gazed

sighed,
and
as
she
