have
the
comfort
of
laughing
together
over
works
of
false
sentimentality
and
pompous
pretension.
Few,
Shirley
conceived,
men
or
women
have
the
right
taste
in
poetry,
the
right
sense
for
discriminating
between
what
is
real
and
what
is
false.
She
had
again
and
again
heard
very
clever
people
pronounce
this
or
that
passage,
in
this
or

haply

tinged
with
the
fascinating
hues
of
fancy,
but,
God
knows,
as
different
from
real
poetry
as

gorgeous
and
massy
vase
of

is
from
the
little
cup
of
pure
metal;
or,
to
give
the
reader

milliner's
artificial
wreath
is
from
the
fresh
gathered
lily
of
the
field.

deception
of
the
flashy
dross.
The
minds
of
the
two
girls
being
toned
in
harmony
often
chimed
very
sweetly
together.
One
evening
they
chanced
to
be
alone
in
the
oak
parlour.
They
had
passed
a
long
wet
day
together
without
ennui.
