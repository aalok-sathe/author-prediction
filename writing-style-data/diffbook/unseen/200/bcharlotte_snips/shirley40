we
marry."
"I
don't
know;
I
never
think
about
it.
If
the
gray
mare
is
handsome
and
tractable,
why
not?"
"The
chops
are
done.
Is
the
punch
brewed?"
"There
is
a
glassful.
Taste
it.
When
Joe
Scott
and
his
minions
return
they
shall
have
a
share
of
this,
provided
they
bring
home
the
frames
intact."
Malone
waxed
very
exultant
over
the
supper.
He
laughed
aloud
at
trifles,
made
bad
jokes
and
applauded
them
himself,
and,
in
short,
grew
unmeaningly
noisy.
His
host,
on
the
contrary,
remained
quiet
as
before.
It
is
time,
reader,
that
you
should
have
some
idea
of
the
appearance
of
this
same
host.
I
must
endeavour
to
sketch
him
as
he
sits
at
table.
He
is
what
you
would
probably
call,
at
first
view,
rather
a
strange
looking
man;
for
he
is
thin,
dark,
sallow,
very
foreign
of
aspect,
with
shadowy
hair
carelessly
streaking
his
forehead.
It
appears
that
he
spends
but
little
time
at
his
toilet,
or
he
would
arrange
it
with
more
taste.
He
seems
unconscious
that
his
features
are
fine,
that
they
have
a
southern
symmetry,
clearness,
regularity
in
their
chiselling;
nor
does
a
spectator
become
aware
of
this
advantage
till
he
has
examined
