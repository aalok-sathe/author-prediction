so
many.
You
may
have
a
friendship
for
a
man,
while
he
is
almost
indifferent
to
you.
Much
of
what
cheers
your
life
may
be
dependent
on
him,
while
not
a
feeling
or
interest
of
moment
in
his
eyes
may
have
reference
to
you.
Robert
used
to
be
in
the
habit
of
going
to
London,
sometimes
for
a
week
or
a
fortnight
together.
Well,
while
he
was
away,
I
found

and
if,
with
its
aid,
I
had
been
enabled
to
take
a
view
of
Robert
to
see
where
he
was,
how
occupied
I
should
have
learned,
in
a
startling
manner,
the
width
of
the
chasm
which
gaped
between
such
as
he
and
such
as
I.
I
knew
