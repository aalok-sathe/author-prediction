"You
will
find
a
good
one
in
the
dining
room
sideboard
a
lady's
knife,
light
to
handle,
and
as
sharp
pointed
as
a
poniard."
"It
will
suit
Caroline.
But
you
must
give
me
a
brace
of
pistols.
I
know
you
have
pistols."
"I
have
two
pairs.
One
pair
I
can
place
at
your
disposal.
You
will
find
them
suspended
over
the
mantelpiece
of
my
study
in
cloth
cases."
"Loaded?"
"Yes,

Cock

you

bed.

is
paying

a
great
compliment,
captain,

have

"I
will

care.
You
need
delay
no

Mr.
Helstone.
You
may
go
now.
He
is
gracious
to
me
to
lend
me
his
pistols,"
she
remarked,
as
the
rector
passed
out
at
the
garden
gate.
"But
come,
Lina,"
she
continued,
"let
us
go
in
and
have
some
supper.
I
was
too
much
vexed
at
tea
with
the
vicinage
of
Mr.
Sam
Wynne
to
be
able
to
eat,
and
now
I
am
really
hungry."
Entering
the
house,
they
repaired
to
the
darkened
dining
room,
through
the
open
windows
of
which
apartment
stole
