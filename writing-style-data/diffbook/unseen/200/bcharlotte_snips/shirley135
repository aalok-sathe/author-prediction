in
his
opinion,
as
she
was
still
but
a
child,
she
might
for
the
present
dispense
with
the
fichu,
especially
as
her
curls
were
long,
and
almost
touched
her
shoulders.
There
was
no
appeal
against
Robert's
opinion,
therefore
his
sister
was
compelled
to
yield;
but
she
disapproved
entirely
of
the
piquant
neatness
of
Caroline's
costume,
and
the
ladylike
grace
of
her
appearance.
Something
more
solid
and
homely
she
would
have
considered
"beaucoup
plus
convenable."
The
afternoon
was
devoted
to
sewing.
Mademoiselle,
like
most
Belgian
ladies,
was
specially
skilful
with
her
needle.
She
by
no
means
thought
it
waste
of
time
to
devote
unnumbered
hours
to
fine
embroidery,
sight
destroying
lace
work,
marvellous
netting
and
knitting,
and,
above
all,
to
most
elaborate
stocking
mending.
She
would
give
a
day
to
the
mending
of
two
holes
in
a
stocking
any
time,
and
think
her
"mission"
nobly
fulfilled
when
she
had
accomplished
it.
It
was
another
of
Caroline's
troubles
to
be
condemned
to
learn
this
foreign
style
of
darning,
which
was
done
stitch
by
stitch,
so
as
exactly
to
imitate
the
fabric
of
the
stocking
itself
a
wearifu'
process,
but
considered
by
Hortense
Gerard,
and
by
her
ancestresses
before
her
for
long
generations
