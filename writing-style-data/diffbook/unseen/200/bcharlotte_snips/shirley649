Mr.
that
is,
the
gentleman
I
married
was,
perhaps,
rather
an
exceptional
than
an
average
character.
I
hope,
at
least,
the
experience
of
few
has
been
such
as
mine
was,
or
that
few
have
felt
their
sufferings
as
I
felt
mine.
They
nearly
shook
my
mind;
relief
was
so
hopeless,
redress
so
unattainable.
But,
my
dear,
I
do
not
wish
to
dishearten;
I
only
wish
to
warn
you,
and
to
prove
that
the
single
should
not
be
too
anxious
to
change
their
state,
as
they
may
change
for
the
worse."
"Thank
you,
my
dear
madam.
I
quite
understand
your
kind
intentions,
but
there
is
no
fear
of
my
falling
into
the
error
to
which
you
allude.
I,
at
least,
have
no
thoughts
of
marriage,
and
for
that
reason
I
want
to
make
myself
a
position
by
some
other
means."
"My
dear,
listen
to
me.
On
what
I
am
going
to
say
I
have
carefully
deliberated,
having,
indeed,
revolved
the
subject
in
my
thoughts
ever
since
you
first
mentioned
your
wish
to
obtain
a
situation.
You
know
I
at
present
reside
with
Miss
Keeldar
in
the
capacity
of
companion.
Should
she
marry
(and
that
she
will
marry
ere
long
many
circumstances
