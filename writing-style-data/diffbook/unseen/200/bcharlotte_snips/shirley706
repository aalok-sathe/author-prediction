not
(as
you
know,
reader)
the
Caroline
of
every
day,
thawed
his
reserve,
and
cheered
his
gravity
soon.
He
sat
near
her
and
talked
to
her.
She
already
knew
his
vocation
was
that
of
tuition.
She
learned
now
he
had
for
some
years
been
the
tutor
of
Mr.
Sympson's
son;
that
he
had
been
travelling
with
him,
and
had
accompanied
him
to
the
north.
She
inquired
if
he
liked
his
post,
but
got
a
look
in
reply
which
did
not
invite

license
further
question.
The
look
woke
Caroline's
ready
sympathy.
She
thought
it
a

She

Robert
was
leaning
against
the
wall,
a
little
behind
her,
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
book
of
engravings,
and
probably
listening,
at
the
same
time,
to
the
dialogue
between
her
and
Louis.
"How
could
I
think
them
alike?"
she
asked
herself.
"I
see
now
it
is
Hortense
Louis
resembles,
not
Robert."
And
this
was
in
part
true.
He
had
the
shorter
nose
and
longer
upper
lip
of
his
sister
