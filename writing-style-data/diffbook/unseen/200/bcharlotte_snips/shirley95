indeed!
The
circumstance
of
the
French
having
seized
Antwerp,
where
I
was
born,
does
not
make
me
a
Frenchman."
"Holland,
then?"
"I
am
not
a
Dutchman.
Now
you
are
confounding
Antwerp
with
Amsterdam."
"Flanders?"
"I
scorn
the
insinuation,
Joe!
I
a
Flamand!
Have
I
a
Flemish
face
the
clumsy
nose
standing
out,
the
mean
forehead
falling
back,
the
pale
blue
eyes
'a
fleur
de
tete'?
Am
I
all
body
and
no
legs,
like
a
Flamand?
But
you
don't
know
what
they
are
like,
those
Netherlanders.
Joe,
I'm
an
Anversois.
My
mother
was
an
Anversoise,
though
she
came
of
French
lineage,
which
is
the
reason
I
speak
French."
"But
your
father
war
Yorkshire,
which
maks
ye
a
bit
Yorkshire
too;
and
onybody
may
see
ye're
akin
to
us,
ye're
so
keen
o'
making
brass,
and
getting
forrards."
"Joe,
you're
an
impudent
dog;
but
I've
always
been
accustomed
to
a
boorish
sort
of
insolence
from
my
youth
up.
The
'classe
ouvriere'
that
is,
the
working
people
in
Belgium
bear
themselves
brutally
towards
their
employers;
and
by
brutally,
Joe,
I
mean
brutalement
which,
perhaps,
when
properly
translated,
should
be
roughly."
"We
allus
speak
our
minds
i'
this
country;
and

young
parsons
