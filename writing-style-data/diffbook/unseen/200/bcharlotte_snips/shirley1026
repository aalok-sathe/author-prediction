Henry
to
the
door.
Without
hesitation
I
said,
'Go
where
you
will,
my
boy;
but,
till
I
call
you,
return
not
here.'
"Henry,
I
could
see,
did
not
like
his
dismissal.
That
boy
is
young,
but
a
thinker;
his
meditative
eye
shines
on
me
strangely
sometimes.
He
half
feels
what
links
me
to
Shirley;
he
half
guesses
that
there
is
a
dearer
delight
in
the
reserve
with
which
I
am
treated
than
in
all
the
endearments
he
is
allowed.
The
young,
lame,
half
grown
lion
would
growl
at
me
now
and
then,
because
I
have
tamed
his
lioness
and
am
her
keeper,
did
not
the
habit
of
discipline
and
the
instinct
of
affection
hold
him
subdued.
Go,
Henry;
you
must
learn
to
take
your
share
of
the
bitter
of
life
with
all
of
Adam's
race
that
have
gone
before
or
will
come
after
you.
Your
destiny
can
be
no
exception
to
the
common
lot;
be
grateful
that
your
love
is
overlooked
thus
early,
before
it
can
claim
any
affinity
to
passion.
An
hour's
fret,
a
pang
of
envy,
suffice
to
express
what
you
feel.
Jealousy
hot
as
the
sun
above
the
line,
rage
destructive
as
the
tropic
storm,
the
clime
