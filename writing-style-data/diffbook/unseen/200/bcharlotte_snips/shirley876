to
it
all
mute,
but
majestic.
"Since
that
day
I
called
S.
to
me
in
the
schoolroom,
and
she
came
and
sat
so
near
my
side;
since
she
opened
the
trouble
of
her
mind
to
me,
asked
my
protection,
appealed
to
my
strength
since
that
hour
I
abhor
Solitude.
Cold
abstraction,
fleshless
skeleton,
daughter,
mother,
and
mate
of
Death!
"It
is
pleasant
to
write
about
what
is
near
and
dear
as
the
core
of
my
heart.
None
can
deprive
me
of
this
little
book,
and
through
this
pencil
I
can
say
to
it
what
I
will
say
what
I
dare
utter
to
nothing
living
say
what
I
dare
not
think
aloud.
"We
have
scarcely
encountered
each
other
since
that
evening.
Once,
when
I
was
alone
in
the
drawing
room,
seeking
a
book
of
Henry's,
she
entered,
dressed
for
a
concert
at
Stilbro'.
Shyness
her
shyness,
not
mine
drew
a
silver
veil
between
us.
Much
cant
have
I
heard
and
read
about
'maiden
modesty,'
but,
properly
used,
and
not
hackneyed,
the
words
are
good
and
appropriate
words.
As
she
passed
to
the
window,
after
tacitly
but
gracefully
recognizing
me,
I
could
call
her
nothing
in
my
own
mind
save
'stainless
virgin.'
