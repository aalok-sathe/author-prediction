endured
and
venerated;
where
a
standing
army
was
maintained,
and
a
host
of
lazy
parsons
and
their
pauper
families
were
kept
on
the
fat
of
the
land?"
Mr.
Helstone,
rising
up
and
putting
on
his
shovel
hat,
observed
in
reply,
"that
in
the
course
of
his
life
he
had
met
with
two
or
three
instances
where
sentiments
of
this
sort
had
been
very
bravely
maintained
so
long
as
health,
strength,
and
worldly
prosperity
had
been
the
allies
of
him
who
professed
them;
but
there
came
a
time,"
he
said,
"to
all
men,
'when
the
keepers
of
the
house
should
tremble;
when
they
should
be
afraid
of
that
which
is
high,
and
fear
should
be
in
the
way;'
and
that
time
was
the
test
of
the
advocate
of
anarchy
and
rebellion,
the
enemy
of
religion
and
order.
Ere
now,"
he
affirmed,
"he
had
been
called
upon
to
read
those
prayers
our
church
has
provided
for
the
sick
by
the
miserable
dying
bed
of
one
of
her
most
rancorous
foes;
he
had
seen
such
a
one
stricken
with
remorse,
solicitous
to
discover
a
place
for
repentance,
and
unable
to
find
any,
though
he
sought
it
carefully
with
tears.
He
must
forewarn
Mr.
