stand
it."
"Ye're
a
raight
hard
un!"
returned
the
workman.
"Willn't
ye
gie
us
a
bit
o'
time?
Willn't
ye
consent
to
mak
your
changes
rather
more
slowly?"
"Am
I
the
whole
body
of
clothiers
in
Yorkshire?
Answer
me
that."
"Ye're
yourseln."
"And
only
myself.
And
if
I
stopped
by
the
way
an
instant,
while
others
are
rushing
on,
I
should
be
trodden
down.
If
I
did
as
you
wish
me
to
do,
I
should
be
bankrupt
in
a
month;
and
would
my
bankruptcy
put
bread
into
your
hungry
children's
mouths?
William
Farren,
neither
to
your
dictation
nor
to
that

any
other
will
I
submit.
Talk
to
me
no
more
about
machinery.
I
will
have
my
own
way.
I
shall
get
new
frames
in
to
morrow.
If
you
broke
these,
I
would
still
get
more.
I'll
never
give
in."
Here
the
mill
bell
rang
twelve
o'clock.
It
was
the
dinner
hour.
Moore
abruptly
turned
from
the
deputation
and
re
entered
his
counting
house.
His
last
words
had
left
a
bad,
harsh
impression;
he,
at
least,
had
"failed
in
the
disposing
of
a
chance
he
was
lord
of."
By
speaking
kindly
to
William
Farren
who
was
a
very
honest
man,
