family,
and
they
are
assembled
in
that
farthest
room
to
the
right,
the
back
parlour.
This
is
the
usual
sitting
room
of
an
evening.
Those
windows
would
be
seen
by
daylight
to
be
of
brilliantly
stained
glass,
purple
and
amber
the
predominant
hues,
glittering
round
a
gravely
tinted
medallion
in
the
centre
of
each,
representing
the
suave
head
of
William
Shakespeare,
and
the
serene
one
of
John
Milton.
Some
Canadian
views
hung
on
the
walls
green
forest
and
blue
water
scenery
and
in
the
midst
of
them
blazes
a
night
eruption
of
Vesuvius;
very
ardently
it
glows,
contrasted
with
the
cool
foam
and
azure
of
cataracts,
and
the
dusky
depths
of
woods.
The
fire
illuminating
this
room,
reader,
is
such
as,
if
you
be
a
southern,
you
do
not
often
see
burning
on
the
hearth
of
a
private
apartment.
It
is
a
clear,
hot
coal
fire,
heaped
high
in
the
ample
chimney.
Mr.
Yorke
will
have
such
fires
even
in
warm
summer
weather.
He
sits
beside
it
with
a
book
in
his
hand,
a
little
round
stand
at
his
elbow
supporting
a
candle;
but
he
is
not
reading
he
is
watching
his
children.
Opposite
to
him
sits
his
lady
