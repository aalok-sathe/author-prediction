and
now
when
she
is
quite
alone
in
the
world,
without
brother
or
sister,
or
any
one
to
care
for
her,
how
charitable
she
is
to
the
poor,
as
far
as
her
means
permit!
Still
nobody
thinks
much
of
her,
or
has
pleasure
in
going
to
see
her;
and
how
gentlemen
always
sneer
at
her!"
"They
shouldn't,
miss.
I
believe
she
is
a
good
woman.
But
gentlemen
think
only
of
ladies'
looks."
"I'll
go
and
see
her,"
exclaimed
Caroline,
starting
up;
"and
if
she
asks
me
to

been
to
her?"
Fanny
helped
Miss
Helstone
to
put
away
her
work,
and
afterwards
assisted
her
to
dress.
"You'll
not
be
an
old
maid,
Miss
Caroline,"
she
said,
as
she
tied
the
sash
of
her
brown
silk
frock,
having
previously
smoothed
her
soft,
full,
and
shining
curls;
"there
are
no
signs
of
an
old
maid
about
you."
Caroline
looked
at
the
little
mirror
before
her,
and
she
thought
