There
he
sleeps,
in
that
church.
To
his
dust
I
say
this
night,
what
I
have
never
said
before,
'James,
slumber
peacefully!
See!
your
terrible
debt
is
cancelled!
Look!
I
wipe
out
the
long,
black
account
with
my
own
hand!
James,
your
child
atones.
This

likeness
of
you
this
thing
with
your
perfect

must
have
suffered!"
"O
child,
the
human
heart
can
suffer!
It
can
hold
more
tears
than
the
ocean
holds
waters.
We
never
know
how
deep,
how
wide
it
is,
till
misery
begins
to
unbind
her
clouds,
and
fill
it
with
rushing
blackness."
"Mother,
forget."
"Forget!"
she
said,
with
the
strangest
spectre
of
a
laugh.
"The
north
pole
will
rush
