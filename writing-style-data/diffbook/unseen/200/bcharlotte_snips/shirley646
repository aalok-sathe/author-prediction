for
ever.
It
may
perish
with
the
dawn
of
eternity,
but
it
tortures
through
time
into
its
deepest
night."
"Yes,
it
tortures
through
time,"
agreed
Caroline,
"except
when
it
is
mutual
love."
"Mutual
love!
My
dear,
romances
are
pernicious.
You
do
not
read
them,
I
hope?"
"Sometimes
whenever
I
can
get
them,
indeed.
But
romance
writers
might
know
nothing
of
love,
judging
by
the
way
in
which
they
treat
of
it."
"Nothing
whatever,
my
dear,"
assented
Mrs.
Pryor
eagerly,
"nor
of
marriage;
and
the
false
pictures
they
give
of
those
subjects
cannot
be
too
strongly
condemned.
They
are
not

They
show
you
only
the
green,
tempting
surface
of
the
marsh,
and
give
not
one
faithful
or
truthful
hint
of
the
slough
underneath."
"But
it
is
not
always
slough,"
objected
Caroline.
"There
are
happy
marriages.
Where
affection
is
reciprocal
and
sincere,
and
minds
are
harmonious,
marriage
must
be
happy."
"It
is
never
wholly
happy.
Two
people
can
never
literally
be
as
one.
There
is,
perhaps,
a
possibility
of
content
under
peculiar
circumstances,
such
as
are
seldom
combined;
but
it
is
as
well
not
to
run
the
risk
you
may
make
fatal
mistakes.
Be
satisfied,
my
dear.
Let
