Moore
had
perhaps
caught
the
fever,
which
for
a
few
days
laid
him
low,
in
one
of
the
poor
cottages
of
the
district,
which
he,
his
lame
pupil,
and
Mr.
Hall
were
in
the
habit
of
visiting
together.
At
any
rate
he
sickened,
and
after
opposing
to
the
malady
a
taciturn
resistance
for
a
day
or
two,
was
obliged
to
keep
his
chamber.
He
lay
tossing
on
his
thorny
bed
one
evening,
Henry,
who
would
not
quit
him,
watching
faithfully
beside
him,
when
a
tap
too
light
to
be
that
of
Mrs.
Gill
or
the
housemaid
summoned
young
Sympson
to
the
door.
"How
is
Mr.
Moore
to
night?"
asked
a
low
voice
from
the
dark
gallery.
"Come
in
and
see
him
yourself."
"Is
he
asleep?"
"I
wish
he
could
sleep.
Come
and
speak
to
him,
Shirley."
"He
would
not
like
it."
But
the
speaker
stepped
in,
and
Henry,
seeing
her
hesitate
on
the
threshold,
took
her
hand
and
drew
her
to
the
couch.
The
shaded
light
showed
Miss
Keeldar's
form
but
imperfectly;
yet
it
revealed
her
in
elegant
attire.
There
was
a
party
assembled
below,
including
Sir
Philip
Nunnely;
the
ladies
were
now
in
the
drawing
room,
and
their
hostess
