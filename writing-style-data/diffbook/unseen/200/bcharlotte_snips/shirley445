but
you
are
so
much
better
than
common
you
are
so
different
to
every
day
young
ladies
I
esteem
you,
I
value
you;
you
are
never
a
burden
to
me
never.
Do
you
believe
what
I
say?"
"Partly,"
replied
Miss
Keeldar,
smiling
rather
incredulously;
"but
you
are
a
peculiar
personage.
Quiet
as
you
look,
there
is
both
a
force
and
a
depth
somewhere
within
not
easily
reached
or
appreciated.
Then
you
certainly
are
not
happy."
"And
unhappy
people
are
rarely
good.
Is
that
what
you
mean?"
"Not
at
all.
I
mean
rather
that
unhappy
people
are
often
preoccupied,
and
not
in
the
mood
for
discoursing
with
companions
of
my
nature.
Moreover,
there
is
a
sort
of
unhappiness
which
not
only
depresses,
but
corrodes;
and
that,
I
fear,
is
your
portion.
Will
pity
do
you
any
good,
Lina?
If
it
will,
take
some
from
Shirley;
she
offers
largely,
and
warrants
the
article
genuine."
"Shirley,
I
never
had
a
sister
you
never
had
a
sister;
but
it
flashes
on
me
at
this
moment
how
sisters
feel
towards
each
other
affection
twined
with
their
life,
which
no
shocks
of
feeling
can
uproot,
which
little
quarrels
only
trample
an
instant,
that
it
may
spring
