flower
and
bird.
In
all
the
grandeur
of
these
forests
there
is
repose;
in
all
their
freshness
there
is
tenderness.
The
gentle
charm
vouchsafed
to
flower
and
tree,
bestowed
on
deer
and
dove,
has
not
been
denied
to
the
human
nursling.
All
solitary,
she
has
sprung
up
straight
and
graceful.
Nature
cast
her
features
in
a
fine
mould;
they
have
matured
in
their
pure,
accurate
first
lines,
unaltered
by
the
shocks
of
disease.
No
fierce
dry
blast
has
dealt
rudely
with
the
surface
of
her
frame;
no
burning
sun
has
crisped
or
withered
her
tresses.
Her
form
gleams
ivory
white
through
the
trees;
her
hair
flows
plenteous,
long,
and
glossy;
her
eyes,
not
dazzled
by
vertical
fires,
beam
in
the
shade
large
and
open,
and
full
and
dewy.
Above
those
eyes,
when
the
breeze
bares
her
forehead,
shines
an
expanse
fair
and
ample
a
clear,
candid
page,
whereon
knowledge,
should
knowledge
ever
come,
might
write
a
golden
record.
You
see
in
the
desolate
young
savage
nothing
vicious
or
vacant.
She
haunts
the
wood
harmless
and
thoughtful,
though
of
what
one
so
untaught
can
think
it
is
not
easy
to
divine.
On
the
evening
of
one
summer
day,
before
the
Flood,
