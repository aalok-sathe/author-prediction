candle
shone
from
any
window.
It
was
absolutely
still;
the
rain
running
from
the
eaves,
and
the
rather
wild
but
very
low
whistle
of
the
wind
round
the
chimneys
and
through
the
boughs
were
the
sole
sounds
in
its
neighbourhood.
This
building
passed,
the
fields,
hitherto
flat,
declined
in
a

One

made
the
little
interior
look
clean
and
fresh.
"Mr.
Moore

at
home,
I
suppose?"
"Yes,
sir,
but
he
is
not
in."
"Not
in!
Where
is
