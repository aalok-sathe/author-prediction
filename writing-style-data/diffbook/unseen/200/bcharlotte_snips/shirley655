keep

gentler
fires
than
those
which
smoulder
in
the
fane
of
Nemesis,
it
was
not
easy
to
discover.
He
seldom
went
near
Fieldhead;
if
he
did,
his
visits
were
brief.
If
he
called
at
the
rectory,
it
was
only
to
hold
conferences
with
the
rector
in
his
study.
He
maintained
his
rigid
course
very
steadily.
Meantime
the
history
of
the
year
continued
troubled.
There
was
no
lull
in
the
tempest
of
war;
her
long
hurricane
still
swept
the
Continent.
There
was
not
the
faintest
sign
of
serene
weather,
no
opening
amid
"the
clouds
of
battle
dust
and
smoke,"
no
fall
of
pure
dews
genial
to
the
olive,
no
cessation
of
the
red
rain
which
nourishes
the
baleful
and
glorious
laurel.
Meantime,
Ruin
had
her
sappers
and
miners
at
work
under
Moore's
feet,
and
whether
he
rode
or
walked,
whether
he
only
crossed
his
counting
house
hearth
or
galloped
over
sullen
Rushedge,
he
was
aware
of
a
hollow
echo,
and
felt
the
ground
shake
to
his
tread.
While
the
summer
thus
passed
with
Moore,
how
did
it
lapse
with
Shirley
and
Caroline?
Let
us
first
visit
the
heiress.
How
does
she
look?
Like
a
love
lorn
maiden,
pale
and
pining
