returned
the
rector
"narrow,
selfish,
and
unpatriotic.
The
man
is
eternally
writing
and
speaking
against
the
continuance
of
the
war.
I
have
no
patience
with
him."
"The
war
hurts
his
trade.
I
remember
he
remarked
that
only
yesterday.
But
what
other
objection
have
you
to
him?"
"That
is

"I
am

the

"Robert
Moore
is
my

"Oh,

you
can
tell
me
all
about
him.
Just
give
me
a
sketch
of
his
character."
Insuperable
embarrassment
seized
Caroline
when
this
demand
was
made.
She
could
not,
