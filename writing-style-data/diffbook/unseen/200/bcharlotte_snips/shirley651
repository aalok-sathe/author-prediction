for.
But
never
again
say
I
am
too
kind.
You
pierce
my
heart,
child!"
"But,
my
dear
madam
this
generosity
I
have
no
claim
"
"Hush!
you
must
not
talk
about
it.
There
are
some
things
we
cannot
bear
to
hear.
Oh!
it
is
late
to
begin,
but
I
may
yet
live
a
few
years.
I
can
never
wipe
out
the
past,
but
perhaps
a
brief
space
in
the
future
may
yet
be
mine."
Mrs.
Pryor
seemed
deeply
agitated.
Large
tears
trembled
in
her
eyes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks.
Caroline
kissed
her,
in
her
gentle,
caressing
way,
saying
softly,
"I
love
you
dearly.
Don't
cry."
But
the
lady's
whole
frame
seemed
shaken.
She
sat
down,
bent
her
head
to
her
knee,
and
wept
aloud.
Nothing
could
console
her
till
the
inward
storm
had
had
its
way.
At
last
the
agony
subsided
of
itself.
"Poor
thing!"
she
murmured,
returning
Caroline's
kiss,
"poor
lonely
lamb!
But
come,"
she
added
abruptly
"come;
we
must
go
home."
For
a
short
distance
Mrs.
Pryor
walked
very
fast.
By
degrees,
however,
she
calmed
down
to
her
wonted
manner,
fell
into
her
usual
characteristic
pace
a
peculiar
one,
like
all
her
movements
and
by
the
time
