the
gate.
A
summons
to
luncheon
called
her
in.
She
excused
herself
from
the
meal,
and
went
upstairs.
"Is
not
Shirley
coming
to
luncheon?"
asked
Isabella.
"She
said
she
was
hungry."
An
hour
after,
as
she
did
not
quit
her
chamber,
one
of
her
cousins
went
to
seek
her
there.
She
was
found
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
bed,
her
head
resting
on
her
hand;
she
looked
quite
pale,
very
thoughtful,
almost
sad.
"You
are
not
ill?"
was
the
question
put.
"A
little
sick,"
replied
Miss
Keeldar.
Certainly
she
was
not
a
little
changed
from
what
she
had
been
two
hours
before.
This
change,
accounted
for
only
by
those
three
words,
explained
no
otherwise;
this
change
whencesoever
springing,
effected
in
a
brief
ten
minutes
passed
like
no
light
summer
cloud.
She
talked
when
she
joined
her
friends
at
dinner,
talked
as
usual.
She
remained
with
them
during
the
evening.
When
again
questioned
respecting
her
health,
she
declared
herself
perfectly
recovered.
It
had
been
a
mere
passing
faintness,
a
momentary
sensation,
not
worth
a
thought;
yet
it
was
felt
there
was
a
difference
in
Shirley.
The
next
day
the
day,
the
week,
the
fortnight
after
this
new
and
peculiar
shadow
