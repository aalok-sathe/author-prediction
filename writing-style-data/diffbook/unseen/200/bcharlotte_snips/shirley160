The
half
mile
to
the
rectory
was
soon
traversed.
They
parted
in
the
garden
without
kiss,
scarcely
with
a
pressure
of
hands;
yet
Robert
sent
his
cousin
in
excited
and
joyously
troubled.
He
had
been
singularly
kind
to
her
that
day
not
in
phrase,
compliment,

Caroline

and
at
eighteen
the
true
narrative
of
life
is
yet
to
be
commenced.
Before
that
time
we
sit
listening
to
a
tale,
a
marvellous
fiction,
delightful
sometimes,
and
sad
sometimes,
almost
always
unreal.
Before
that
time
our
world
is
heroic,
