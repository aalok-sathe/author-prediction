lack
of
sympathy
with
your
flock."
"I
hope
not
I
expect
success;
but
we
must
have
money.
There
is
the
paper.
Pray
give
a
handsome
sum."
When
asked
for
money,
Shirley
rarely
held
back.
She
put
down
her
name
for
5.
After
the
300
she
had
lately
given,
and
the
many
smaller
sums
she
was
giving
constantly,
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
at
present
afford.
Donne
looked
at
it,
declared
the
subscription
"shabby,"
and
clamorously
demanded
more.
Miss
Keeldar
flushed
up
with
some
indignation
and
more
astonishment.
"At
present
I
shall
give
no
more,"
said
she.
"Not
give
more!
Why,
I
expected
you
to
head
the
list
with
a
cool
hundred.
With
your
property,
you
should
never
put
down
a
signature
for
less."
She
was
silent.
"In
the
south,"
went
on
Donne,
"a
lady
with
a
thousand
a
year
would
be
ashamed
to
give
five
pounds
for
a
public
object."
Shirley,
so
rarely
haughty,
looked
so
now.
Her
slight
frame
became
nerved;
her
distinguished
face
quickened
with
scorn.
"Strange
remarks?"
said
she
"most
inconsiderate!
Reproach
in
return
for
bounty
is
misplaced."
"Bounty!
Do
you
call
five
pounds
bounty?"
"I
do;
and
bounty
which,
had
I
not
given
it
