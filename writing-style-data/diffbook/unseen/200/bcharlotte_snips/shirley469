the
kitchen.
The
dog
made
a
spring;
the
second
gentleman
turned
tail
and
rushed
after
his
comrade.
The
first
was
already
safe
in
a
bedroom;
he
held
the
door
against
his
fellow
nothing
so
merciless
as
terror.
But
the
other
fugitive
struggled
hard;
the
door
was
about
to
yield
to
his
strength.
"Gentlemen,"
was
uttered
in
Miss
Keeldar's
silvery
but
vibrating
tones,
"spare
my
locks,
if
you
please.
Calm
yourselves!
Come
down!
Look
at
Tartar;
he
won't
harm
a
cat."
She
was
caressing
the
said
Tartar.
He
lay
crouched
at
her
feet,
his
fore
paws
stretched
out,
his
tail
still
in
threatening
agitation,
his
nostrils
snorting,
his
bulldog
eyes
conscious
of
a
dull
fire.
He
was
an
honest,
phlegmatic,
stupid,
but
stubborn
canine
character.
He
loved
his
mistress
and
John
the
man
who
fed
him
but
was
mostly
indifferent
to
the
rest
of
the
world.
Quiet
enough
he
was,
unless
struck
or
threatened
with
a
stick,
and
that
put
a
demon
into
him
at
once.
"Mr.
Malone,
how
do
you
do?"
continued
Shirley,
lifting
up
her
mirth
lit
face
to
the
gallery.
"That
is
not
the
way
to
the
oak
parlour;
that
is
Mrs.
Pryor's
apartment.
Request
your
friend
Mr.
