poor
Hebrew
wanderers
were
afoot.
Few
of
them,
it
is
likely,
had
better
weapons
than
their
shepherds'
crooks
or
their
masons'
building
tools;
their
meek
and
mighty
leader
himself
had
only
his
rod.
But
bethink

Robert
Moore,
right
was
with

parallel.
France
is
Israel,
and
Napoleon
is
Moses.
Europe,
with
her
old
overgorged
empires
and
rotten
dynasties,
is
corrupt
Egypt;
gallant
France
