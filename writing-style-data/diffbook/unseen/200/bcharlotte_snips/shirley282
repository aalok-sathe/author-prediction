on
the
road."
"So
would
I.
Would
you
take
an
ugly
one?"
"Bah!
I
hate
ugliness
and
delight
in
beauty.
My
eyes
and
heart,
Yorke,
take
pleasure
in
a
sweet,
young,
fair
face,
as
they
are
repelled
by
a
grim,
rugged,
meagre
one.
Soft

"I'll

try,
I
tell
you.
Grace
at
least
I
will
have,
and
youth
and
symmetry
yes,
and
what
I
call
beauty."
"And
poverty,
and
a
nursery
full
of
bairns
you
can
neither
clothe
nor
feed,
and
very
soon
an
anxious,
faded
mother;
and
then
bankruptcy,
discredit
a
life
long
struggle."
"Let

alone,
Yorke."
"If
you
are
romantic,
Robert,
