"Look
in

glass
just
behind
you.
Compare
the
face
you
see
there
with
that
of
any
early
rising,
hard
working
milkmaid."
"My
face
is
a
pale
one,
but
it
is
not
sentimental;
and
most
milkmaids,
however
red
and
robust
they
may
be,
are
more
stupid
and
less
practically
fitted
to
make
their
way
in
the
world
than
I
am.
I
think
more,
and
more
correctly,
than
milkmaids
in
general
do;
consequently,
where
they
would
often,
for
want
of
reflection,
act
weakly,
I,
by
dint
of
reflection,
should
act
judiciously."
"Oh
no!
you
would
be
influenced

your
feelings;
you
would
be
guided

impulse."
"Of
course
I
should
often
be
influenced
by
my
feelings.
They
were
given
me
to
that
end.
Whom
my
feelings
teach
me
to
love
I
must
and
shall
love;
and
I
hope,
if
ever
I
have
a
husband
and
children,
my
feelings
will
induce
me
to
love
them.
I
hope,
in
that
case,
all
my
impulses
will
be
strong
in
compelling
me
to
love."
