his
mouth,
withdrew
slowly,
and,
as
Miss
Keeldar
again
intimated
her
intention
to
"give
way"
and
swoon
on
the
spot,
he
turned
on
his
heel,
and
beat
a
heavy
retreat.
Moore
at
last
returned.
Calmly
surveying
the
bustle,
and
somewhat
quizzically
scanning
Shirley's
enigmatical
looking
countenance,
he
remarked
that
in
truth
this
was
the
hottest
end
of
the
room,
that
he
found
a
climate
there
calculated
to
agree
with
none
but
cool
temperaments

whole
turmoil,
in

one
side,
he
installed
himself
where
destiny
evidently
decreed
he
should

features

raised

of
the
mouth
became
straight

wilfulness
and
roguery
gave
place
to
other
expressions;

angular
movements

which
she
had
vexed
the
soul
of
Sam
Wynne
were
conjured
to
rest
as
by
a
charm.
Still
no
gracious
glance
was
cast
on
Moore.
On
the
contrary,
he
was
accused
of
giving
her
a
world
of
trouble,
and
roundly
charged
with
being
the
cause
of
depriving
her
of
the
esteem
of
Mr.
Ramsden
and
the
invaluable
friendship
of
Mr.
Samuel
Wynne.
