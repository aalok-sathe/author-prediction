the
first
place,
though
I
should
stay
till
dark
there
will
be
no
arrival;
because
I
feel
in
my
heart,
Fate
has
written
it
down
in
to
day's
page
of
her
eternal
book,
that
I
am
not
to
have
the
pleasure
I
long
for.
In
the
second
place,
if
he
stepped
in
this
moment,
my
presence
here
would
be
a
chagrin
to
him,
and
the
consciousness
that
it
must
be
so
would
turn
half
my
blood
to
ice.
His
hand
would,
perhaps,
be
loose
and
chill
if
I
put
mine
into
it;
his
eye
would
be
clouded
if
I
sought
its
beam.
I
should
look
up
for
that
kindling,
something
I
have
seen
in
past
days,
when
my
face,
or
my
language,
or
my
disposition
had
at
some
happy
moment
pleased
him;
I
should
discover
only
darkness.
I
had
better
go
home."
She
took
her
bonnet
from
the
table
where
it
lay,
and
was
just
fastening
the
ribbon,
when
Hortense,
directing
her
attention
to
a
splendid
bouquet
of
flowers
in
a
glass
on
the
same
table,
mentioned
that
Miss
Keeldar
had
sent
them
that
morning
from
Fieldhead;
and
went
on
to
comment
on
the
guests
that
lady
was
at
present
