time
was
apparent.
It
might
not
be
the
head
of
a
goddess
indeed
a
screw
of
curl
paper
on
each
side
the
temples
quite
forbade
that
supposition
but
neither
was
it
the
head
of
a
Gorgon;
yet
Malone
seemed
to
take
it
in
the
latter
light.
Big
as
he
was,
he
shrank
bashfully
back
into
the
rain
at
the
view
thereof,
and
saying,
"I'll
go

a
rousing
tattoo.
A
key
turned;
the
door
unclosed.
"Is
it
Joe
Scott?
What
news
of
the
wagons,
Joe?"
"No;
it's
myself.
Mr.
Helstone
would
send
me."
"Oh!
Mr.
Malone."
The
voice
in
uttering
this
name
had
the
slightest
possible
cadence
of
disappointment.
After
a
moment's
pause
it
continued,
politely
but
a
little
formally,
"I
beg

will
come
in,
Mr.
Malone.
