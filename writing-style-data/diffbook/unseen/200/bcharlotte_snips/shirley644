of

include
the
higher
classes
of
society),
are,
in
my
opinion,
indispensable
to
the
well
being
of
every
community.
All
I
mean
to
say,
my
dear,
is
that
you
had
better
not
attempt
to
be
a
governess,
as
the
duties
of
the
position
would
be
too
severe
for
your
constitution.
Not
one
word
of
disrespect
would
I
breathe
towards
either
Mrs.
or
Miss

only,
recalling
my
own

your
work;
you
would
come

if
you
still
had
a

Those
languishing
years
would
follow
of
which
none
but
the
invalid
and
her
immediate
friends
feel
the
heart

and
know
the
burden.
Consumption
or
decline
would
close
the
chapter.
Such
is
the
history
of
many
a
life.
I
would
not
have
it
yours.
My
dear,
we
will
now
walk
about
a
little,
if
you
please."
They
both
rose,
and
slowly
paced
a
green
natural
terrace
bordering
the
chasm.
"My
dear,"
ere
long
again
began
Mrs.
Pryor,
a
sort
of
timid,
embarrassed
abruptness
