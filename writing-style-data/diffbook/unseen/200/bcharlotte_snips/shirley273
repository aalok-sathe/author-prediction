for
thy
fastidious
senses."
Martin
looked
disdain,
but
vouchsafed
no
further
reply.
Meantime
Mark,
who
for
some
minutes
had
been
rummaging
amongst
a
pile
of
books
on
a
side
table,
took
the
word.
He
spoke
in
a
peculiarly
slow,
quiet
voice,
and
with
an
expression
of
still
irony
in
his
face
not
easy
to
describe.
"Mr.
Moore,"
said
he,
"you
think
perhaps
it
was
a
compliment
on
Miss
Caroline
Helstone's
part
to
say
you
were
not
sentimental.
I
thought
you
appeared
confused
when
my
sisters
told
you
the
words,
as
if
you
felt
flattered.
You
turned
red,
just
like
a
certain
vain
little
lad
at
our
school,
who
always
thinks
proper
to
blush
when
he
gets
a
rise
in
the
class.
For
your
benefit,
Mr.
Moore,
I've
been
looking
up
the
word
'sentimental'
in
the
dictionary,
and
I
find
it
to
mean
'tinctured
with
sentiment.'
On
examining
further,
'sentiment'
is
explained
to
be
thought,
idea,
notion.
A
sentimental
man,
then,
is
one
who
has
thoughts,
ideas,
notions;
an
unsentimental
man
is
one
destitute
of
thought,
idea,
or
notion."
And
Mark
stopped.
He
did
not
smile,
he
did
not
look
round
for
admiration.
He
had
said
his
say,
and
was
silent.
