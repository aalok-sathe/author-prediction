no
means
a
more
agreeable
tie;
for
as
his
firm
had
been
connected
with
Moore's
in
business,
it
had
also,
in
some
measure,
been
implicated
in
its
losses.
Thirdly,
he
had
found
Robert
himself
a
sharp
man
of
business.
He
saw
reason
to
anticipate
that
he
would,
in
the
end,
by
one
means
or
another,
make
money;
and
he
respected
both
his
resolution
and
acuteness
perhaps,
also,
his
hardness.
A
fourth
circumstance
which
drew
them
together
was
that
of
Mr.
Yorke
being
one
of
the
guardians
of
the
minor
on
whose
estate
Hollow's
Mill
was
situated;
consequently
Moore,
in
the
course
of
his
alterations
and
improvements,
had
frequent
occasion
to
consult
him.
As
to
the
other
guest
now
present
in
Mr.
Yorke's
parlour,
Mr.
Helstone,
between
him
and
his
host
there
existed
a
double
antipathy
the
antipathy
of
nature
and
that
of
circumstances.
The
free
thinker
hated
the
formalist;
the
lover
of
liberty
detested
the
disciplinarian.
Besides,
it
was
said
that
in
former
years
they
had
been
rival
suitors
of
the
same
lady.
Mr.
Yorke,
as
a
general
rule,
was,
when
young,
noted
for
his
preference
of
sprightly
and
dashing
women:
a
showy
shape
and
air,
a
lively
wit,
a
