over
the
sun
broke
out
genially,
heaven
regained
its
azure,
and
earth
its
green;
the
livid
cholera
tint
had
vanished
from
the
face
of
nature;
the
hills
rose
clear
round
the
horizon,
absolved
from
that
pale
malaria
haze.
Caroline's
youth
could
now
be
of
some
avail
to
her,
and
so
could
her
mother's
nurture.
Both,
crowned
by
God's
blessing,
sent
in
the
pure
west
wind
blowing
soft
as
fresh
through
the
ever
open
chamber
lattice,
rekindled
her
long
languishing
energies.
At
last
Mrs.
Pryor
saw
that
it
was
permitted
to
hope:
a
genuine,
material
convalescence
had
commenced.
It
was
not
merely
Caroline's
smile
which
was
brighter,
or
her
spirits
which
were
cheered,
but
a
certain
look
had
passed
from
her
face
and
eye
a
look
dread
and
indescribable,
but
which
will
easily
be
recalled
by
those
who
have
watched
the
couch
of
dangerous
disease.
Long
before
the
emaciated
outlines
of
her
aspect
began
to
fill,
or
its
departed
colour
to
return,
a
more
subtle
change
took
place;
all
grew
softer
and
warmer.
Instead
of
a
marble
mask
and
glassy
eye,
Mrs.
Pryor
saw
laid
on
the
pillow
a
face
pale
and
wasted
enough,
perhaps
more
haggard
than
the
other
appearance,
