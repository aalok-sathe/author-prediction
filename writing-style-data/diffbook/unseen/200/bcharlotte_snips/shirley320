besieged
her.
Weak
suggestions
whispered
in
her
weary
heart
to
write
to
Robert,
and
say
that
she
was
unhappy
because
she
was
forbidden
to
see
him
and
Hortense,
and
that
she
feared
he
would
withdraw
his
friendship
(not
love)
from
her,
and

One

secret,

and
know

mother
strengthened
daily;
but
with
the
desire
was
coupled
a
doubt,
a
dread
if
she
knew
her,
could
she
love

There
was
cause
for
hesitation,
for
apprehension
on
this
point.
Never
in
her
life
had
she
heard
