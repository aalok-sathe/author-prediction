and
both
inclined
their
heads
towards
the
open
lattice.
They
saw
each
other's
young
faces
by
the
starlight
and
that
dim
June
twilight
which
does
not
wholly
fade
from
the
west
till
dawn
begins
to
break
in
the
east.
"Mr.
Helstone
thinks
we
have
no
idea
which
way
he
is
gone,"
murmured
Miss
Keeldar,
"nor
on
what
errand,
nor

the
air.
They
wrapped
their
scarves
closer
round
them,
resumed
their
bonnets,
which
they
had
removed,
and
again
watched.
Towards
midnight
the
teasing,
monotonous
bark
of
the
house
dog
disturbed
the
quietude
of
their
vigil.
Caroline
rose,
and
made
her
way
noiselessly

the
dark
