was
a
very
orderly,
economical
person.
The
petticoat,
camisole,
and
curl
papers
were
her
morning
costume,
in
which,
of
forenoons,
she
had
always
been
accustomed
to
"go
her
household
ways"
in
her
own
country.
She
did
not
choose
to
adopt
English
fashions
because
she
was
obliged
to
live
in
England;
she
adhered
to
her
old
Belgian
modes,
quite
satisfied
that
there
was
a
merit
in
so
doing.
Mademoiselle
had
an
excellent
opinion
of
herself
an
opinion
not
wholly
undeserved,
for
she
possessed
some
good
and
sterling
qualities;
but
she
rather
over
estimated
the
kind
and
degree
of
these
qualities,
and
quite
left
out
of
the
account
sundry
little
defects
which
accompanied
them.
You
could
never
have
persuaded
her
that
she
was
a
prejudiced
and
narrow
minded
person,
that
she
was
too
susceptible
on
the
subject
of
her
own
dignity
and
importance,
and
too
apt
to
take
offence
about
trifles;
yet
all
this
was
true.
However,
where
her
claims
to
distinction
were
not
opposed,
and
where
her
prejudices
were
not
offended,
she
could
be
kind
and
friendly
enough.
To
her
two
brothers
(for
there
was
another
Gerard
Moore
besides
Robert)
she
was
very
much
attached.
