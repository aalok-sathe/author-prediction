support
and
succour
in
the
depths
of
self
earned
degradation,
and
that
it
was
still
her
hand
which
kept
him
from
utter
destitution.
Miss
Helstone
stayed
the
whole
evening,
omitting
to
pay
her
other
intended
visit;
and
when
she
left
Miss
Mann
it
was
with
the
determination
to
try
in
future
to
excuse
her
faults;
never
again
to
make
light
of
her
peculiarities
or
to
laugh
at
her
plainness;
and,
above
all
things,
not
to
neglect
her,
but
to
come
once
a
week,
and
to
offer
her,
from
one
human
heart
at
least,
the
homage
of
affection
and
respect.
She
felt
she
could
now
sincerely
give
her
a
small
tribute
of
each
feeling.
Caroline,
on
her
return,
told
Fanny
she
was
very
glad
she
had
gone
out,
as
she
felt
much
better
for
the
visit.
The
next
day
she
failed
not
to
seek
Miss
Ainley.
This
lady
was
in
narrower
circumstances
than
Miss
Mann,
and
her
dwelling
was
more
humble.
It
was,
however,
if
possible,
yet
more
exquisitely
clean,
though
the
decayed
gentlewoman
could
not
afford
to
keep
a
servant,
but
waited
on
herself,
and
had
only
the
occasional
assistance
of
a
little
girl
who
lived
in
a
cottage
near.
