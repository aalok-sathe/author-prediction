in
the
court
for
the
chance
of
witnessing
her
return,
and
for
the
dearer
chance
of
receiving
her
in
my
arms
from
the
saddle.
I
have
noticed
(again
it
is
to
this
page
only
I
would
make
the
remark)
that
she
will
never
permit
any
man
but
myself
to
render
her
that
assistance.
I
have
seen
her
politely
decline
Sir
Philip
Nunnely's
aid.
She
is
always
mighty
gentle
with
her
young
baronet,

I
have

conscious
how
my
strength
rejoices
to
serve
her?
I

am
not
her
slave
I
declare
it
but
my
faculties
gather
to
her
beauty,
like
the
genii
to
the
glisten
of
the
lamp.
All
my
knowledge,
all
my
prudence,
all
my
calm,
and
all
my
power
stand
in
her
presence
humbly
waiting
a
task.
How
glad
they
are
when
a
mandate
comes!
What
joy
they
take
in
the
toils
she
assigns!
Does
she
know
it?
"I
have
called
her
careless.
It
is
remarkable
that
