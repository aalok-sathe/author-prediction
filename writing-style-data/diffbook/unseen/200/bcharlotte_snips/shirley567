back
to
Fieldhead?"
"And
what
will
Mrs.
Pryor
do?
she
expects
me
home."
"I
will
send
her
word.
Come,
make
up
your
mind
to
stay.
It
grows
late;
the
dew
falls
heavily.
You
and
Caroline
will
enjoy
each
other's
society,
I
doubt
not."
"I
promise
you,
then,
to
stay
with
Caroline,"
replied
Shirley.
"As
you
say,
we
shall
enjoy
each
other's
society.
We
will
not
be
separated
to
night.
Now,
rejoin
your
old
friend,
and
fear
nothing
for
us."
"If
there
should
chance
to
be
any
disturbance
in
the
night,
captain;
if
you
should
hear
the
picking
of
a
lock,
the
cutting
out
of
a
pane
of
glass,
a
stealthy
tread
of
steps
about
the
house
(and
I
need
not
fear
to
tell
you,
who
bear
a
well
tempered,
mettlesome
heart
under
your
girl's
ribbon
sash,
that
such
little
incidents
are
very
possible
in
the
present
time),
what
would
you
do?"
"Don't
know;
faint,
perhaps
fall
down,
and
have
to
be
picked
up
again.
But,
doctor,
if
you
assign
me
the
post
of
honour,
you
must
give
me
arms.
What
weapons
are
there
in
your
stronghold?"
"You
could
not
wield
a
sword?"
"No;
I
could
manage
the
carving
knife
better."
