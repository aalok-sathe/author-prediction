happy
than
we
are
at
this
day.
Are
they
good?
No,
not
better
than
ourselves.
Their
nature
is
our
nature
human
both.
There
is
one
in
this
tribe
too
often
miserable
a
child
bereaved
of
both
parents.
None
cares
for
this
child.
She
is
fed
sometimes,
but
oftener
forgotten.
A
hut
rarely
receives
her;
the
hollow
tree
and
chill
cavern
are
her
home.
Forsaken,
lost,
and
wandering,
she
lives
more
with
the
wild
beast
and
bird
than
with
her
own
kind.
Hunger
and
cold
are
her
comrades;
sadness
hovers
over,
and
solitude
besets
her
round.
Unheeded
and
unvalued,
she
should
die;
but
she
both
lives
and
grows.
The
green
wilderness
nurses
her,
and
becomes
to
her
a
mother;
feeds
her
on
juicy
berry,
on
saccharine
root
and
nut.
There
is
something
in
the
air
of
this
clime
which
fosters
life
kindly.
There
must
be
something,
too,
in
its
dews
which
heals
with
sovereign
balm.
Its
gentle
seasons
exaggerate
no
passion,
no
sense;
its
temperature
tends
to
harmony;
its
breezes,
you
would
say,
bring
down
from
heaven
the
germ
of
pure
thought
and
purer
feeling.
Not
grotesquely
fantastic
are
the
forms
of
cliff
and
foliage,
not
violently
vivid
the
colouring
of
