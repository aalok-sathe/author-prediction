when
I
came
home.
It
means
a
man
hater."
"What
besides?"
"Hannah
Sykes
said
you
were
a
solemn
puppy."
"Better!"
cried
Mr.
Yorke,
laughing.
"Oh,
excellent!
Hannah!
that's
the
one
with
the
red
hair
a
fine
girl,
but
half
witted."
"She
has
wit
enough
for
me,
it
appears,"
said
Moore.
"A
solemn
puppy,
indeed!
Well,
Rose,
go
on."
"Miss
Pearson
said
she
believed
there
was
a
good
deal
of
affectation
about
you,
and
that
with
your
dark
hair
and
pale
face
you
looked
to
her
like
some
sort
of
a
sentimental
noodle."
Again
Mr.
Yorke
laughed.
Mrs.
Yorke
even
joined
in
this
time.
"You
see
in
what
esteem
you
are
held
behind
your
back,"
said
she;
"yet
I
believe
that
Miss
Pearson
would
like
to
catch
you.
She
set
her
cap
at
you
when
you
first
came
into
the
country,
old
as
she
is."
"And
who
contradicted
her,
Rosy?"
inquired
Moore.
"A
lady
whom
I
don't
know,
because
she
never
visits
here,
though
I
see
her
every
Sunday
at
church.
She
sits
in
the
pew
near
the
pulpit.
I
generally
look
at
her,
instead
of
looking
at
my
prayer
book,
for
she
is
like
