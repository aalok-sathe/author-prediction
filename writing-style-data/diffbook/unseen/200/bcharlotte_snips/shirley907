of
approach.
I
have
joined
the
circle
round
her
seat,
caught
her
eye,
and
mastered
her
attention;
then
we
have
conversed;
and
others,
thinking
me,
perhaps,
peculiarly
privileged,
have
withdrawn
by
degrees,
and
left
us
alone.
Were
we
happy
thus
left?
For
myself,
I
must
say
No.
Always
a
feeling
of
constraint
came
over
me;
always
I
was
disposed
to
be
stern
and
strange.
We
talked
politics
and
business.
No
soft
sense
of
domestic
intimacy
ever
opened
our
hearts,
or
thawed
our
language
and
made
it
flow
easy
and
limpid.
If
we
had
confidences,
they
were
confidences
of
the
counting
house,
not
of
the
heart.
Nothing
in
her
cherished
affection
in
me,
made
me
better,
gentler;
she
only
stirred
my
brain
and
whetted
my
acuteness.
She
never
crept
into
my
heart
or
influenced
its
pulse;
and
for
this
good
reason,
no
doubt,
because
I
had
not
the
secret
of
making
her
love
me."
"Well,
lad,
it
is
a
queer
thing.
I
might
laugh
at
thee,
and
reckon
to
despise
thy
refinements;
but
as
it
is
dark
night
and
we
are
by
ourselves,
I
don't
mind
telling
thee
that
thy
talk
brings
back
a
glimpse
of
my
own
past
life.
