It
was
boyish.
His
features
were
plain
and
slight,
his
hair
sandy,
his
stature
insignificant.
But
she
soon
checked
her
sarcasm
on
this
point;
she
would
even
fire
up
if
any
one
else
made
uncomplimentary
allusion
thereto.
He
had
"a
pleasing
countenance,"
she
affirmed;
"and
there
was
that
in
his
heart
which
was
better
than

the
proportions
of

the
country,
and
quarters
himself
up
in
London
for
weeks
together,
and
by
the
time
he
comes
back
he'll
find
himself
checkmated.
Louis,
'there
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men,
which,
taken
at
the
flood,
leads
on
to
fortune,
but,
once
let
slip,
never
returns
