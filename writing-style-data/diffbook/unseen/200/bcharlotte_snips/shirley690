Lowering
her

charge.
"Your
cousin
Hortense
is
an
excellent
sister,
Miss
Helstone.
Such
ladies
as
come
to
try
their
life's
luck
here
at
Hollow's
Cottage
may,
by
a
very
little
clever
female
artifice,
cajole

a
lesson
on
the
cultivation
of
rectitude,
to
disgust
you
with
craft
and
false
sentiment."
"Do
I
need
this
lesson?"
"Most
young
