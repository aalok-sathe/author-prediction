and
we'll
keep
him.
But
mind,
Rose,
he's
not
so
much
your
friend
as
he
is
mine.
He
is
my
particular
acquaintance;
remember
that!"
And
she
held
up
her
small
hand
with
an
admonitory
gesture.
Rose
was
quite
accustomed
to
be
admonished
by
that
small
hand.
Her
will
daily
bent
itself
to
that
of
the
impetuous
little
Jessy.
She
was
guided,
overruled
by
Jessy
in
a
thousand
things.
On
all
occasions
of
show
and
pleasure
Jessy
took
the
lead,
and
Rose
fell
quietly
into
the
background;
whereas,
when
the
disagreeables
of
life

was
to
be
married;
Rose,
she
decided,
must
be
an
old
maid,
to
live
with
her,
look
after
her
children,
keep
her
house.
This
state
of
things
is
not
uncommon
between
two
sisters,
where
one
is
plain
and
the
other
pretty;
but
in
this
case,
if
there
was
a
difference
in
external
appearance,
Rose
had
the
advantage:
her
face
was
more
regular
featured
than
that
of
the
piquant
