as
yet
far
from
strong?"
"I
assure
you
he
did
not
find
me
weak.
I
did
not
cry
when
he
was
here."
"He
is
about
to
evacuate
Fieldhead
so
he
says.
He
is
now
giving
orders
to
his
family.
He
has
been
in
the
schoolroom
issuing
commands
in
a
manner
which,
I
suppose,
was
a
continuation
of
that
with
which
he
has

"Are

Henry
is
concerned,

the
tenor
of

and
comment
by
and
by,
when
I
have
time
to
bestow
on
them.
At
the
moment
he
came
in
I
was
busied
with
a
note
I
had
got
from
Mr.
Yorke
so
fully
busied
that
I
cut
short
the
interview
with
him
somewhat
abruptly.
I
left
him

Here
is
the
note.
I
wish
you
to
see

It
refers
to
my
brother
Robert."
And
