of
custom
they
are
pale."
"My
chance
is
quite
over,
I
suppose?"
"It
ought
to
be.
But
try;
it
is
worth
trying.
I
call
this
Sir
Philip
milk
and
water.
And
then
he
writes
verses,
they
say
tags
rhymes.
You
are
above
that,
Bob,
at
all
events."
"Would
you
advise
me
to
propose,
late
as
it
is,
Mr.
Yorke
at
the
eleventh
hour?"
"You
can
but
make
the
experiment,
Robert.
If
she
has
a
fancy
for
you
and,
on
my
conscience,
I
believe
she
has
or
had
she
will
forgive
much.
But,
my
lad,
you
are
laughing.
Is
it
at
me?
You
had
better
grin
at
your
own
perverseness.
I
see,
however,
you
laugh
at
the
wrong
side
of
your
mouth.
You
have
as
sour
a
look
at
this
moment
as
one
need
wish
to
see."
"I
have
so
quarrelled
with
myself,
Yorke.
I
have
so
kicked
against
the
pricks,
and
struggled
in
a
strait
waistcoat,
and
dislocated
my
wrists
with
wrenching
them
in
handcuffs,
and
battered
my
hard
head
by
driving
it
against
a
harder
wall."
"Ha!
I'm
glad
to
hear
that.
Sharp
exercise
yon!
I
hope
it
has
done
you
good
ta'en
some
of
the
self
conceit
out
