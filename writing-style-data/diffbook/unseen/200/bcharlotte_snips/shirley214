extracted
from
the
hat
crown,
that
it
was
"raight
dahn
warm
for
Febewerry."
Mr.
Moore
assented
at
least
he
uttered
some
slight
sound,
which,
though
inarticulate,
might
pass
for
an
assent.
The
visitor
now
carefully
deposited
in
the
corner
beside
him
an
official
looking
staff
which
he
bore
in
his
hand;
this

probably

in

morning,"
said
the
fustian
gentleman,
rising
and
doing
as
requested.
"Will
you
tak
naught
yourseln,

Moore?"
