it
is."
"Ye'se
hear,
sir.
If
I
cannot
get
it
off,
there's
eleven
behint
can
help
me.
It
is
a
grand
purpose,
and"
(changing
his
voice
from
a
half
sneer
to
a
whine)
"it's
the
Looard's
own
purpose,
and
that's
better."
"Do
you
want
a
subscription
to
a
new
Ranter's
chapel,
Mr.
Barraclough?
Unless
your
errand
be
something
of
that
sort,
I
cannot
see
what
you
have
to
do
with
it."
"I
hadn't
that
duty
on
my
mind,
sir;
but
as
Providence
has
led
ye
to
mention
the
subject,
I'll
make
it
i'
my
way
to
tak
ony
trifle
ye
may
have
to
spare;
the
smallest
contribution
will
be
acceptable."
With
that
he
doffed
his
hat,
and
held
it
out
as
a
begging
box,
a
brazen
grin
at
the
same
time
crossing
his
countenance.
"If
I
gave
you
sixpence
you
would
drink
it."
Barraclough
uplifted
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
the
whites
of
his
eyes,
evincing
in
the
gesture
a
mere
burlesque
of
hypocrisy.
"You
seem
a
fine
fellow,"
said
Moore,
quite
coolly
and
dryly;
"you
don't
care
for
showing
me
that
you
are
a
double
dyed
hypocrite,
that
your
trade
is
fraud.
You
expect
indeed
to
make
me
