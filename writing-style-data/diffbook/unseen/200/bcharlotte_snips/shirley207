out
his
new
system
with
effect,
if
he
chose
to
improve
it.
Perhaps
he
found
it
easier
to
practise
that
system
in
broad
daylight,
in
his
mill
yard,
amidst
busy
occupations,
than
in
a
quiet
parlour,
disengaged,
at
the
hour
of
eventide.
Fanny
lit
the
candles,
which
before
had
stood
unlit
on
the
table,
brought
writing
materials,
and
left
the
room.
Caroline
was
about
to
follow
her.
Moore,
to
act
consistently,
should
have
let

him
that
I
have
got
a
clue
to
the
identity
of
one,
at
least,
of
the
men
who
broke
my
frames;
that
he
belongs
to
the
same
gang
who
attacked
Sykes
and
Pearson's
dressing
shop,
and
that
I
hope
to
have
him
in
custody
to
