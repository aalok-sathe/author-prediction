at
her
mother
with
an
expression
that
seemed
to
say
she
should
take
that
maxim
in
and
think
it
over
at
her
leisure.
After
two
minutes'
grave
deliberation,
she
asked,
"And
why
especially
girls,
mother?"
"Firstly,
because
I
say
so;
and
secondly,
because
discretion
and
reserve
are
a
girl's
best
wisdom."
"My
dear
madam,"
observed
Moore,
"what
you
say
is
excellent
it
reminds
me,
indeed,
of
my
dear
sister's
observations;
but
really
it
is
not
applicable
to
these
little
ones.
Let
Rose
and
Jessy
talk
to
me
freely,
or
my
chief
pleasure
in
coming
here
is
gone.
I
like
their
prattle;
it
does
me
good."
"Does
it
not?"
asked
Jessy.
"More
good
than
if
the
rough
lads
came
round
you.
You
call
them
rough,
mother,
yourself."
"Yes,
mignonne,
a
thousand
times
more
good.
I
have
rough
lads
enough
about
me
all
day
long,
poulet."
"There
are
plenty
of
people,"
continued
she,
"who
take
notice
of
the
boys.
All
my
uncles
and
aunts
seem
to
think
their
nephews
better
than
their
nieces,
and
when
gentlemen
come
here
to
dine,
it
is
always
Matthew,
and
Mark,
and
Martin
that
are
talked
to,
and
never
Rose
and
me.
Mr.
Moore
is
our
friend,
