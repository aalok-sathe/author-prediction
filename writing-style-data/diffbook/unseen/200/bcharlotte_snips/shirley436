Moore
was
almost
caught.
He
had
to
"dodge"
after
all,
to
coast
round
the
church,
and
finally
to
bend
his
tall
form
behind
the
Wynnes'
ambitious
monument.
There
he
was
forced
to
hide
full
ten
minutes,
kneeling
with
one
knee
on
the
turf,
his
hat
off,
his
curls
bare
to
the
dew,
his
dark
eye
shining,
and
his

this
time,
though
not
absorbed
in
the
tranquil
employment
he
ascribed
to
her,
but
standing
at
her
window
with
fast
throbbing
heart,
peeping
anxiously
from
behind
the
blind,
watching
for
her
uncle
to
re
enter
and
her
cousin
