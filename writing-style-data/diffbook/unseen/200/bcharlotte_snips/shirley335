manner,
or
to
give
her
additional
courage
to
face
strangers,
and
she
quailed,
in
spite
of
self
remonstrance,
as
she
and
her
uncle
walked
up
the
broad,
paved
approach
leading
from
the
gateway
of
Fieldhead
to
its
porch.
She
followed
Mr.
Helstone
reluctantly
through
that
porch
into
the
sombre
old
vestibule
beyond.
Very
sombre
it
was
long,
vast,
and
dark;
one
latticed
window
lit
it
but
dimly.
The
wide
old
chimney
contained
now
no
fire,
for
the
present
warm
weather
needed
it
not;
it
was
filled
instead
with
willow
boughs.
The
gallery
on
high,
opposite
the
entrance,
was
seen
but
in
outline,
so
shadowy
became
this
hall
towards
its
ceiling.
Carved
stags'
heads,
with
real
antlers,
looked
down
grotesquely
from
the
walls.
This
was
neither
a
grand
nor
a
comfortable
house;
within
as
without
it
was
antique,
rambling,
and
incommodious.
A
property
of
a
thousand
a
year
belonged
to
it,
which
property
had
descended,
for
lack
of
male
heirs,
on
a
female.
There
were
mercantile
families
in
the
district
boasting
twice
the
income,
but
the
Keeldars,
by
virtue
of
their
antiquity,
and
their
distinction
of
lords
of
the
manor,
took
the
precedence
of
all.
Mr.
and
Miss
Helstone
were
ushered
