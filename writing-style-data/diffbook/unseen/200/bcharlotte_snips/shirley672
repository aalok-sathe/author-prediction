your
gayest
companions
in
health,
your
tenderest
nurses
in
sickness,
your
most
faithful
prop
in
age."
One
fine
summer
day
that
Caroline
had
spent
entirely
alone
(her
uncle
being
at
Whinbury),
and
whose
long,
bright,
noiseless,
breezeless,
cloudless
hours
(how
many
they
seemed
since
sunrise!)
had
been
to
her
as
desolate
as
if
they
had
gone
over
her
head
in
the
shadowless
and
trackless
wastes
of
Sahara,
instead

of
an
English

A

voice
answered
"Fanny!"
It
issued
from
the
alcove,
and
thither
Fanny
hastened,
a
note
in
her
hand,
which
she
delivered
to
fingers
that
hardly
seemed
to
have
nerve
to
hold
it.
Miss
Helstone
did
not
ask
whence
it
came,
and
she
did
not
look
at
it;
she
let
it
drop
amongst
the
folds
of
her
work.

said
Fanny.
