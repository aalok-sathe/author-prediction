you
think
so;
but
my
character
is
not,
perhaps,
quite
as
legible
to
you
as
a
page
of
the
last
new
novel
might
be."
"That
is
possible.
But
this
sleep
I
should
like
to
woo
it
to
your
pillow,
to
win
for
you
its
favour.
If
I
took
a
book
and
sat
down
and
read
some
pages?
I
can
well
spare
half
an
hour."
"Thank
you,
but
I
will
not
detain
you."
"I
would
read
softly."
"It
would
not
do.
I
am
too
feverish
and
excitable
to
bear
a
soft,
cooing,
vibrating
voice
close
at
my
ear.
You
had
better
leave
me."
"Well,
I
will
go."
"And
no
good
night?"
"Yes,
sir,
yes.
Mr.
Moore,
good
night."
(Exit
Shirley.)
"Henry,
my
boy,
go
to
bed
now;
it
is
time
you
had
some
repose."
"Sir,
it
would
please
me
to
watch
at
your
bedside
all
night."
"Nothing
less
called
for.
I
am
getting
better.
There,
go."
"Give
me
your
blessing,
sir."
"God
bless
you,
my
best
pupil!"
"You
never
call
me
your
dearest
pupil!"
"No,
nor
ever
shall."
Possibly
Miss
Keeldar
resented
her
former
teacher's
rejection
of
her
courtesy.
It
is
certain
she
did
not
repeat
the
offer
of
it.
