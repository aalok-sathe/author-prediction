to
take
her
guitar
and
sing
and
play.
She
then
became
quite
good
natured.
And
as
she
played
with
skill,
and
had
a
well
toned
voice,
it
was
not
disagreeable
to
listen
to
her.
It
would
have
been
absolutely
agreeable,
except
that
her
formal
and
self
important
character
modulated
her
strains,
as
it
impressed
her
manners
and
moulded
her
countenance.
Mr.
Moore,
released
from
the
business
yoke,
was,
if
not
lively
himself,
a
willing
spectator
of
Caroline's
liveliness,
a
complacent
listener
to
her
talk,
a
ready
respondent

Sometimes

he
was
sure
to
be
frozen
up
again;
and
however
much
he
seemed,
in
his
quiet
way,
to
enjoy
these
social
evenings,
he
rarely
contrived
their
recurrence.
This
circumstance
puzzled
the
inexperienced
head
of
his
cousin.
"If
I
had
a
means
of
happiness
at
my
command,"
she
thought,
"I
would
employ
that
means
often.
I
would
keep
it
bright
with
use,
and
not
let
it
lie
for
weeks
aside,
till
it
gets
rusty."
Yet
