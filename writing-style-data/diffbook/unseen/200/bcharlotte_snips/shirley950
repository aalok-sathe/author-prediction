bulk
in
the
estimation
of
others.
Perfectly
cowed
by
the
breadth,
the
height,
the
bone,
and
the
brawn
of
Mrs.
Horsfall,
they
retreated
to
the
back
parlour.
She,
for
her
part,
sat
upstairs
when
she
liked,
and
downstairs
when
she
preferred
it.
She
took
her
dram
three
times
a
day,
and
her
pipe
of
tobacco
four
times.
As
to
Moore,
no
one
now
ventured
to
inquire
about
him.
Mrs.
Horsfall
had
him
at
dry
nurse.
It
was
she
who
was
to
do
for
him,
and
the
general
conjecture
now
ran
that
she
did
for
him
accordingly.
Morning
and
evening
MacTurk
came
to
see
him.
His
case,
thus
complicated
by
a
new
mischance,
was
become
one
of
interest
in
the
surgeon's
eyes.
He
regarded
him
as
a
damaged
piece
of
clockwork,
which
it
would
be
creditable
to
his
skill
to
set
agoing
again.
Graves
and
young
MacTurk
Moore's
sole
other
visitors
contemplated
him
in
the
light
in
which
they
were
wont
to
contemplate
the
occupant
for
the
time
being
of
the
dissecting
room
at
Stilbro'
Infirmary.
Robert
Moore
had
a
pleasant
time
of
it
in
pain,
in
danger,
too
weak
to
move,
almost
too
weak
to
speak,
a
sort
of
giantess
