Joe,
holding
supercilious
theories
about
women
in
general,
resented
greatly,
in
his
secret
soul,
the
fact
of
his
master
and
his
master's
mill
being,
in
a
manner,
under
petticoat
government,
and
had
felt
as
wormwood
and
gall
certain
business
visits
of
the
heiress
to
the
Hollow's
counting
house.
"Because
there
is
nought
agate
that
fits
women
to
be
consarned
in."
"Indeed!
There
is
prayer
and
preaching
agate
in
that
church.
Are
we
not
concerned
in
that?"
"Ye
have
been
present
neither
at
the
prayer
nor
preaching,
ma'am,
if
I
have
observed
aright.
What
I
alluded
to
was
politics.
William
Farren
here
was
touching
on
that
subject,
if
I'm
not
mista'en."
"Well,
what
then?
Politics
are
our
habitual
study,
Joe.
Do
you
know
I
see
a
newspaper
every
day,
and
two
of
a
Sunday?"
"I
should
think
you'll
read
the
marriages,
probably,
miss,
and
the
murders,
and
the
accidents,
and
sich
like?"
"I
read
the
leading
articles,
Joe,
and
the
foreign
intelligence,
and
I
look
over
the
market
prices.
In
short,
I
read
just
what
gentlemen
read."
Joe
looked
as
if
he
thought
this
talk
was
like
the
chattering
of
a
pie.
He
replied
to
it
by
a
disdainful
silence.
"Joe,"
