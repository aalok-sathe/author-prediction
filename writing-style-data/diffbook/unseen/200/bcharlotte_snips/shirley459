Caroline
or
rather,
it
was
to
Caroline's
care
Mr.
Hall
consigned
himself.
He
generally
sought
Caroline
in
every
party
where
she
and
he
happened
to
be.
He
was
not
in
general
a
lady's
man,
though
all
ladies
liked
him;
something
of
a
book
worm
he
was,
near
sighted,
spectacled,
now
and
then
abstracted.
To
old
ladies
he
was
kind
as
a
son.
To
men
of
every
occupation
and
grade
he
was
acceptable.
The
truth,
simplicity,
frankness
of
his
manners,
the
nobleness
of
his
integrity,
the
reality
and
elevation
of
his
piety,
won
him
friends
in
every
grade.
His
poor
clerk
and
sexton
delighted
in
him;
the
noble
patron
of
his
living
esteemed
him
highly.
It
was
only
with
young,
handsome,
fashionable,
and
stylish
ladies
he
felt
a
little
shy.
Being
himself
a
plain
man
plain
in
aspect,
plain
in
manners,
plain
in
speech
he
seemed
to
fear
their
dash,
elegance,
and
airs.
But
Miss
Helstone
had
neither
dash
nor
airs,
and
her
native
elegance
was
of
a
very
quiet
order
quiet
as
the
beauty
of
a
ground
loving
hedge
flower.
He
was
a
fluent,
cheerful,
agreeable
talker.
Caroline
could
talk
too
in
a
tete
a
tete.
She
liked

Hall
