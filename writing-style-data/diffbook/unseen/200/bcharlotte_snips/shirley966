ill
afford
to
dispense;
the
second,
third,
fourth,
to
get
his
mother,
Miss
Moore,
and
Mrs.
Horsfall
successfully
out
of
the
way
before
four
o'clock
that
afternoon.
The
first
was,
for
the
present,
the
most
pressing,
since
the
work
before
him
demanded
an
amount
of
energy
which
the
present
empty
condition
of
his
youthful
stomach
did
not
seem
likely
to
supply.
Martin
knew
the
way
to
the
larder,
and
knowing
this
way
he
took
it.
The
servants
were
in
the
kitchen,
breakfasting
solemnly
with
closed
doors;
his
mother
and
Miss
Moore
were
airing
themselves
on
the
lawn,
and
discussing
the
closed
doors
aforesaid.
Martin,
safe
in
the
larder,
made
fastidious
selection
from
its
stores.
His
breakfast
had
been
delayed;
he
was
determined
it
should
be
recherche.
It
appeared
to
him
that
a
variety
on
his
usual
somewhat
insipid
fare
of
bread
and
milk
was
both
desirable
and
advisable;
the
savoury
and
the
salutary
he
thought
might
be
combined.
There
was
store
of
rosy
apples
laid
in
straw
upon
a
shelf;
he
picked
out
three.
There
was
pastry
upon
a
dish;
he
selected
an
apricot
puff
and
a
damson
tart.
On
the
plain
household
bread
his
eye
did
not
dwell;
but
