in
dialogue
by
a
short
dispute
on
the
subject
of
"cafe
au
lait,"
which
Sarah
said
was
the
queerest
mess
she
ever
saw,
and
a
waste
of
God's
good
gifts,
as
it
was
"the
nature
of
coffee
to
be
boiled
in
water,"
and
which
mademoiselle
affirmed
to
be
"un
breuvage
royal,"
a
thousand
times
too
good
for
the
mean
person
who
objected
to
it.
The
former
occupants
of
the
kitchen
now
withdrew
into
the
parlour.
Before
Hortense
followed
them
thither,
Caroline
had
only
time
again
to
question,
"Not
my
enemy,
Robert?"
And
Moore,
Quaker
like,
had
replied
with
another
query,
"Could
I
be?"
And
then,
seating
himself
at
the
table,
had
settled
Caroline
at
his
side.
Caroline
scarcely
heard
mademoiselle's
explosion
of
wrath
when
she
rejoined
them;
the
long
declamation
about
the
"conduite
indigne
de
cette
mechante
creature"
sounded
in
her
ear
as
confusedly
as
the
agitated
rattling
of
the
china.
Robert
laughed
a
little
at
it,
in
very
subdued
sort,
and
then,
politely
and
calmly
entreating
his
sister
to
be
tranquil,
assured
her
that
if
it
would
yield
her
any
satisfaction,
she
should
have
her
choice
of
an
attendant
amongst
all
the
girls
in
his
mill.
Only
he
feared
