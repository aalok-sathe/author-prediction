an
aunt,
and
two
cousins
from
the
south
a
Mr.,
Mrs.,
and
two
Misses
Sympson,
of
Sympson
Grove,
shire
came
down
upon
her
in
state.
The
laws
of
hospitality
obliged
her
to
give
in,
which
she
did
with
a
facility
which
somewhat
surprised
Caroline,
who
knew
her
to
be
prompt
in
action
and
fertile
in
expedient
where
a
victory
was
to
be
gained
for
her
will.
Miss
Helstone
even
asked
her
how
it
was
she
submitted
so
readily.
She
answered,
old
feelings
had
their
power;
she
had
passed
two
years
of
her
early
youth
at
Sympson
Grove.
"How
did
she
like
her
relatives?"
She
had
nothing
in
common
with
them,
she
replied.
Little
Harry
Sympson,
indeed,
the
sole
son
of
the
family,
was
very
unlike
his
sisters,
and
of
him
she
had
formerly
been
fond;
but
he
was
not
coming
to
Yorkshire
at
least
not
yet.
The
next
Sunday
the
Fieldhead
pew
in
Briarfield
Church
appeared
peopled
with
a
prim,
trim,
fidgety,
elderly
gentleman,
who
shifted
his
spectacles,
and
changed
his
position
every
three
minutes;
a
patient,
placid
looking
elderly
lady
in
brown
satin;
and
two
pattern
young
ladies,
in
pattern
attire,
with
pattern
deportment.
Shirley
had
the
air
of
