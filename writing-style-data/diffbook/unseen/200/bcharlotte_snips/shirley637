"I
do
hope
this
sweet
air
blowing
from
the
hill
will
do
you
good,
my
dear
Caroline.
I
wish
I
could
see
something
more
of
colour
in
these
cheeks;
but
perhaps
you
were
never
florid?"
"I
had
red
cheeks

Miss
Helstone,

the
future

evil
of
the
day
is
sometimes
oppressive
too
oppressive
and
I
long
to
escape
it."
"That
