almost
like
speaking
to
a
parson
to
consult
with
you."
Flattered
and
fawned
upon
as
Shirley
was
just
now,
it
appeared
she
was
not
absolutely
spoiled
that
her
better
nature
did
not
quite
leave
her.
Universal
report
had
indeed
ceased
to
couple
her
name
with
that
of
Moore,
and
this
silence
seemed
sanctioned
by
her
own
apparent
oblivion
of
the
absentee;
but
that
she
had
not
quite
forgotten
him
that
she
still
regarded
him,
if
not
with
love,
yet
with
interest
seemed
proved
by
the
increased
attention
which
at
this
juncture
of
affairs
a
sudden
attack
of
illness
induced
her
to
show
that
tutor
brother
of
Robert's,
to
whom
she
habitually
bore
herself
with
strange
alternations
of
cool
reserve
and
docile
respect
now
sweeping
past
him
in
all
the
dignity
of
the
moneyed
heiress
and
prospective
Lady
Nunnely,
and
anon
accosting
him
as
abashed
school
girls
are
wont
to
accost
their
stern
professors;
bridling
her
neck
of
ivory
and
curling
her
lip
of
carmine,
if
he
encountered
her
glance,
one
minute,
and
the
next
submitting
to
the
grave
rebuke
of
his
eye
with
as
much
contrition
as
if
he
had
the
power
to
inflict
penalties
in
case
of
contumacy.
