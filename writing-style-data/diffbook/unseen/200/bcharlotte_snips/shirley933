in
her
demeanour
to
him;
he
will
never
change
in
his
duty
to
her.
Come,
cease
to
chafe,
uncle,
I'll
tell
you
his
name."
"You
shall
tell
me,
or
"
"Listen!
Arthur
Wellesley,
Lord
Wellington."
Mr.
Sympson
rose
up
furious.
He
bounced
out
of
the
room,
but
immediately
bounced
back
again,
shut
the
door,
and

I
form
no
part
