After
tea
Shirley
reads,
and
she
is
just
about
as
tenacious
of
her
book
as
she
is
lax
of
her
needle.
Her
study
is
the
rug,
her
seat
a
footstool,
or
perhaps
only
the
carpet
at
Mrs.
Pryor's
feet:
there
she
always
learned
her
lessons
when
a
child,
and
old
habits
have
a
strong
power
over
her.
The
tawny
and
lionlike
bulk
of
Tartar
is
ever
stretched
beside
her,
his
negro
muzzle
laid
on
his
fore
paws
straight,
strong,
and
shapely
as
the
limbs
of
an
Alpine
wolf.
One
hand
of
the
mistress
generally
reposes
on
the
loving
serf's
rude
head,
because
if
she
takes
it
away
he
groans
and
is
discontented.
Shirley's
mind
is
given
to
her
book.
She
lifts
not
her
eyes;
she
neither
stirs
nor
speaks
unless,
indeed,
it
be
to
return
a
brief
respectful
answer
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
addresses
deprecatory
phrases
to
her
now
and
then.
"My
dear,
you
had
better
not
have
that
great
dog
so
near
you;
he
is
crushing
the
border
of
your
dress."
"Oh,
it
is
only
muslin.
I
can
put
a
clean
one
on
to
morrow."
"My
dear,
I
wish
you
could
acquire
the
habit
of
sitting
to
a
