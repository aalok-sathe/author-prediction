her
to
bed.
Having
laid
her
down
and
drawn
the
curtain,
she
stood
listening
near.
The
little
couch
trembled,
the
suppressed
sob
stirred
the
air.
A
contraction
as
of
anguish
altered
Mrs.
Pryor's
features;
she
wrung
her
hands;
half
a
groan
escaped
her
lips.
She
now
remembered
that
Tuesday
was
Whinbury
market
day.
Mr.
Moore
must
always
pass
the
rectory
on
his
way
thither,
just
ere
noon
of
that
day.
Caroline
wore
continually
round
her
neck
a
slender
braid
of
silk,
attached
to
which
was
some
trinket.
Mrs.
Pryor
had
seen
the
bit
of
gold
glisten,
but
had
not
yet
obtained
a
fair
view
of
it.
Her
patient
never
parted
with
it.
When
dressed
it
was
hidden
in
her
bosom;
as
she
lay
in
bed
she
always
held
it
in
her
hand.
That
Tuesday
afternoon
the
transient
doze
more
like
lethargy
than
sleep
which
sometimes
abridged
the
long
days,
had
stolen
over
her.
The
weather
was
hot.
While
turning
in
febrile
restlessness,
she
had
pushed
the
coverlets
a
little
aside.
Mrs.
Pryor
bent
to
replace
them.
The
small,
wasted
hand,
lying
nerveless
on
the
sick
girl's
breast,
clasped
as
usual
her
jealously
guarded
treasure.
Those
fingers
whose
attenuation
it
gave
