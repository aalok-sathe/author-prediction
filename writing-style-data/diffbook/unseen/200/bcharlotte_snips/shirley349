in
the
neighbourhood,
with
whose
connections
in
the
south
she
said
she
was
acquainted.
Shirley
soon
withdrew
her
gaze
from
Miss
Helstone's
face.
She
did
not
renew
her
interrogations,
but
returning
to
her
flowers,
proceeded
to
choose
a
nosegay
for
the
rector.
She
presented
it
to
him
as
he
took
leave,
and
received
the
homage
of
a
salute
on
the
hand
in
return.
"Be
sure
you
wear
it
for
my
sake,"
said
she.
"Next
my
heart,
of
course,"
responded
Helstone.
"Mrs.
Pryor,
take
care
of
this
future
magistrate,
this
churchwarden
in
perspective,
this
captain
of
yeomanry,
this
young
squire
of
Briarfield,
in
a
word.
Don't
let
him
exert
himself
too
much;
don't
let
him
break
his
neck
in
hunting;
especially,
let
him
mind
how
he
rides
down
that
dangerous
hill
near
the
Hollow."
"I
like
a
descent,"
said
Shirley;
"I
like
to
clear
it
rapidly;
and
especially
I
like
that
romantic
Hollow
with
all
my
heart."
"Romantic,
with
a
mill
in
it?"
"Romantic
with
a
mill
in
it.
The
old
mill
and
the
white
cottage
are
each
admirable
in
its
way."
"And
the
counting
house,
Mr.
Keeldar?"
"The
counting
house
is
better
than
my
bloom
coloured
drawing
room.
I
adore
