his
prowess
and
rehearsed
his
deeds
many
of
them
interspersing
their
flatteries
with
coarse
invectives
against
the
operative
class
was
a
delectable
sight
for
Mr.
Yorke.
His
heart
tingled
with
the
pleasing
conviction
that
these
gross
eulogiums
shamed
Moore
deeply,
and
made
him
half
scorn
himself
and
his
work.
On
abuse,
on
reproach,
on
calumny,
it
is
easy
to
smile;
but
painful
indeed
is
the
panegyric
of
those
we
contemn.
Often
had
Moore
gazed
with
a
brilliant
countenance
over
howling
crowds
from
a
hostile
hustings.
He
had
breasted
the
storm
of
unpopularity
with
gallant
bearing
and
soul
elate;
but
he
drooped
his
head
under
the
half
bred
tradesmen's
praise,
and
shrank
chagrined
before
their
congratulations.
Yorke
could
not
help
asking
him
how
he
liked
his
supporters,
and
whether
he
did
not
think
they
did
honour
to
his
cause.
"But
it
is
a
pity,
lad,"
he
added,
"that
you
did
not
hang
these
four
samples
of
the
unwashed.
If
you
had
managed
that
feat,
the
gentry
here
would
have
riven
the
horses
out
of
the
coach,
yoked
to
a
score
of
asses,
and
drawn
you
into
Stilbro'
like
a
conquering
general."
Moore
