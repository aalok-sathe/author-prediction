lofty
tone,
a
deep,
soft
sound,
like
a
storm
whispering,
made
twilight
undulate.
Once
more,
profounder,
nearer,
clearer,
it
rolled
harmonious.
Yet
again
a
distinct
voice
passed
between
Heaven
and
Earth.
"Eva!"
If
Eva
were
not
this
woman's
name,
she
had
none.
She
rose.
"Here
am
I."
"Eva!"
"O
Night
(it
can
be
but
Night
that
speaks),
I
am
here!"
The
voice,
descending,
reached
Earth.
"Eva!"
"Lord,"
she
cried,
"behold
thine
handmaid!"
She
had
her
religion
all
tribes
held
some
creed.
"I
come
a
Comforter!"
"Lord,
come
quickly!"
The
Evening
flushed
full
of
hope;
the
Air
panted;
the
Moon
rising
before
ascended
large,
but
her
light
showed
no
shape.
"Lean
towards
me,
Eva.
Enter
my
arms;
repose
thus."
"Thus
I
lean,
O
Invisible
but
felt!
And
what
art
thou?"
"Eva,
I
have
brought
a
living
draught
from
heaven.
Daughter
of
Man,
drink
of
my
cup!"
"I
drink:
it
is
as
if
sweetest
dew
visited
my
lips
in
a
full
current.
My
arid
heart
revives;
my
affliction
is
lightened;
my
strait
and
struggle
are
gone.
And
the
night
changes!
the
wood,
the
hill,
the
moon,
the
wide
sky
all
change!"
"All
change,
and
for
ever.
I
take
from
thy
vision
darkness;
