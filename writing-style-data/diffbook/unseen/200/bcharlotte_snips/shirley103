was
not
verdant,
but
bleached,
as
was
the
grass
on
the
bank,
and
under
the
hedge
in
the
lane.
Three
trees,
gracefully
grouped,
rose
beside
the
cottage.
They
were
not
lofty,
but
having
no
rivals
near,
they
looked
well
and
imposing
where
they
grew.
Such
was
Mr.
Moore's
home
a
snug
nest
for
content
and
contemplation,
but
one
within
which
the
wings
of
action
and
ambition
could
not
long
lie
folded.
Its
air
of
modest
comfort
seemed
to
possess
no
particular
attraction
for
its
owner.
Instead
of
entering
the
house
at
once
he
fetched
a
spade
from
a
little
shed
and
began
to
work
in
the
garden.
For
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
dug
on
uninterrupted.
At
length,
however,
a
window
opened,
and
a
female
voice
called
to
him,
"Eh,
bien!
Tu
ne
dejeunes
pas
ce
matin?"
The
answer,
and
the
rest
of
the
conversation,
was
in
French;
but
as
this
is
an
English
book,
I
shall
translate
it
into
English.
"Is
breakfast
ready,
Hortense?"
"Certainly;
it
has
been
ready
half
an
hour."
"Then
I
am
ready
too.
I
have
a
canine
hunger."
He
threw
down
his
spade,
and
entered
the
house.
The
narrow
passage
conducted
him
to
