It
was
now
on
the
edge
of
dark;
candles
were
not
yet
brought
in;
both,
as
twilight
deepened,
grew
meditative
and
silent.
A
western
wind
roared
high
round
the
hall,
driving
wild
clouds
and
stormy
rain
up
from
the
far
remote
ocean;
all
was

the
antique
lattices,
all

Shirley
sat
at
the
window,
watching
the
rack
in
heaven,
the
mist
on
earth,
listening
to
certain
notes
of
the
gale
that

obeyed
the
fitful
impulse
of
the
wind;
they
swelled
as
its
gusts
rushed
on,
and
died
as
they
wandered
away.
Caroline,
withdrawn
to
the
farthest
and
darkest
end
of
the
room,
her
figure
just
discernible
by
the
ruby
shine
of
the
flameless
fire,
was
pacing
to
and

muttering
to
herself
fragments
of
well
