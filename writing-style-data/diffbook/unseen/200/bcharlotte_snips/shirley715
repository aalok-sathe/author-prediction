all
for
her
friend;
but
seeing
her
change
and
sink
from
time
to
time
when
she
paid
her
visits,
alarm
clutched
her
heart.
She
went
to
Mr.
Helstone
and
expressed
herself
with
so
much
energy
that
that
gentleman
was
at
last
obliged,
however
unwillingly,
to
admit
the
idea
that
his
niece
was
ill
of
something
more
than
a
migraine;
and
when
Mrs.
Pryor
came
and
quietly
demanded
a
physician,
he
said
she
might
send
for
two
if
she
liked.
One
came,
but
that
one
was
an
oracle.
He
delivered
a
dark
saying
of
which
the
future
was
to
solve
the
mystery,
wrote
some
prescriptions,
gave
some
directions
the
whole
with
an
air
of
crushing
authority
pocketed
his
fee,
and
went.
Probably
he
knew
well
enough
he
could
do
no
good,
but
didn't
like
to
say
so.
Still,
no
rumour
of
serious
illness
got
wind
in
the
neighbourhood.
At
Hollow's
Cottage
it
was
thought
that
Caroline
had
only
a
severe
cold,
she
having
written
a
note
to
Hortense
to
that
effect;
and
mademoiselle
contented
herself
with
sending
two
pots
of
currant
jam,
a
recipe
for
a
tisane,
and
a
note
of
advice.
Mrs.
Yorke
being
told
that
a
physician
had
been
