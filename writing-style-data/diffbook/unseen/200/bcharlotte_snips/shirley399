understanding
the
most
convenient
in
the
world,
that
we
shall
each
do
as
we
please."
"How
do
you
please
to
do?"
"Three
nights
in
the
week
I
sleep
in
the
mill
but
I
require
little
rest
and
when
it
is
moonlight
and
mild
I
often
haunt
the
Hollow
till
daybreak."
"When
I
was
a
very
little
girl,
Mr.
Moore,
my
nurse
used
to
tell
me
tales
of
fairies
being
seen
in
that
Hollow.
That
was
before
my
father
built
the
mill,
when
it
was
a
perfectly
solitary
ravine.
You
will
be
falling
under
enchantment."
"I
fear
it
is
done,"
said
Moore,
in
a
low
voice.
"But
there
are
worse
things
than
fairies
to
be
guarded
against,"
pursued
Miss
Keeldar.
"Things
more
perilous,"
he
subjoined.
"Far
more
so.
For
instance,
how
would
you
like
to
meet
Michael
Hartley,
that
mad
Calvinist
and
Jacobin
weaver?
They
say
he
is
addicted
to
poaching,
and
often
goes
abroad
at
night
with
his
gun."
"I
have
already
had
the
luck
to
meet
him.
We
held
a
long
argument
together
one
night.
A
strange
little
incident
it
was;
I
liked
it."
"Liked
it?
I
admire
your
taste!
Michael
is
not
sane.
Where
did
you
meet
him?"
