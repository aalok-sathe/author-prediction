order
the
better
to
talk
it
over,
Mr.
Hall
lifted
the
least
of
the
children
on
to
his
knee,
and
placed
his
hand
on
the
head
of
the
next
least;
but
when
the
small
things
began
to
chatter
to
him
he
bade
them
"Whisht!"
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
grate,
he
regarded
the
handful
of
embers
which
burned
there
very
gravely.
"Sad
times,"
he

"And

any
good
use
of
it?
Could
you
get
into
a
new
way
of
doing
something?"
Farren
did
not

but
his
wife
said
quickly,
"Ay,
I'm

could,
sir.
He's
a
very

our
William.

he'd
