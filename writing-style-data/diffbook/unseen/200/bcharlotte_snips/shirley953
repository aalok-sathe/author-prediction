a
certain
mossy
mound
at
its
root,
convenient
as
a
seat.
Why
is
he
lingering
here?
The
air
is
cold
and
the
time
wears
late.
He
sits
down.
What
is
he
thinking
about?
Does
he
feel
the
chaste
charm
Nature
wears
to
night?
A
pearl
white
moon
smiles
through
the
gray
trees;
does
he
care
for
her
smile?
Impossible
to
say;
for
he
is
silent,
and
his
countenance
does
not
speak.
As
yet
it
is
no
mirror
to
reflect
sensation,
but
rather
a
mask
to
conceal
it.
This
boy
is
a
stripling
of
fifteen
slight,
and
tall
of
his
years.
In
his
face
there
is
as
little
of
amenity
as
of
servility,
his
eye
seems
prepared
to
note
any
incipient
attempt
to
control
or
overreach
him,
and
the
rest
of
his
features
indicate
faculties
alert
for
resistance.
Wise
ushers
avoid
unnecessary
interference
with
that
lad.
To
break
him
in
by
severity
would
be
a
useless
attempt;
to
win
him
by
flattery
would
be
an
effort
worse
than
useless.
He
is
best
let
alone.
Time
will
educate
and
experience
train
him.
Professedly
Martin
Yorke
(it
is
a
young
Yorke,
of
course)
tramples
on
the
name
of
poetry.
Talk
sentiment
to
him,
