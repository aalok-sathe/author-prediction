that
this
damsel
was
said
to
have
three
suitors
Frederic
Murgatroyd,
Jeremiah
Pighills,
and
John
of
Mally's
of
Hannah's
of
Deb's;
and
that
Miss
Mann
had
affirmed
she
knew
for
a
fact
that,
now
the
girl
was
left
in
sole
charge
of
the
cottage,
she
often
had
her
swains
to
meals,
and
entertained
them
with
the
best
the
house
afforded.
It
needed
no
more.
Hortense
could
not
have
lived
another
hour
without
betaking
herself
to
the
scene
of
these
nefarious
transactions,
and
inspecting
the
state
of
matters
in
person.
Mrs.
Horsfall
remained.
Martin,
master
of
the
field
now,
extracted
from
his
mother's
work
basket
a
bunch
of
keys;
with
these
he
opened
the
sideboard
cupboard,
produced
thence
a
black
bottle
and
a
small
glass,
placed
them
on
the
table,
nimbly
mounted
the
stairs,
made
for
Mr.
Moore's
door,
tapped;
the
nurse
opened.
"If
you
please,
ma'am,
you
are
invited
to
step
into
the
back
parlour
and
take
some
refreshment.
You
will
not
be
disturbed;
the
family
are
out."
He
watched
her
down;
he
watched
her
in;
himself
shut
the
door.
He
knew
she
was
safe.
The
hard
work
was
done;
now
for
the
pleasure.
He
snatched
his
cap,
and
away
