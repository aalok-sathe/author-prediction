simple
sentence
very
artlessly,
a
little
timidly,
pronounced;
but
it
chimed
in
harmony
to
the
youth's
nature.
It
stilled
him
like
a
note
of
music.
Martin
had
a
keen
sense
of
his
personality;
he
felt
it
right
and
sensible
that
the
girl
should
discriminate
him
from
his
brothers.
Like
his
father,
he
hated
ceremony.
It
was
acceptable
to
hear
a
lady
address

"and
Rose
and
Jessie?"
"I
suppose
so."
"My
cousin
Hortense
is
still
at
Briarmains?"
"Oh
yes."
Martin
gave
a
comic
half
smile
and
demi
groan.
The
half
smile
was
responded
to
by
the
lady,
who
could
guess
in
what
sort
of
odour
Hortense
was
likely
to
be
held
by
the
young
Yorkes.
"Does
your
mother
like
