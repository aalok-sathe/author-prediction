is
a
most
pleasurable
vexation.
I
delight
to
find
her
at
fault;
and
were
I
always
resident
with
her,
I
am
aware
she
would
be
no
niggard
in
thus
ministering
to
my
enjoyment.
She
would
just
give
me
something
to
do,
to
rectify
a
theme
for
my
tutor
lectures.
I
never
lecture
Henry,
never
feel
disposed
to
do
so.
If
he
does
wrong
and
that
is
very
seldom,
dear,
excellent
lad!
a
word
suffices.
Often
I
do
no
more
than
shake
my
head.
But
the
moment
her
minois
mutin
meets
my
eye,
expostulatory
words
crowd
to
my
lips.
From
a
taciturn
man
I
believe
she
would
transform
me
into
a
talker.
Whence
comes
the
delight
I
take
in
that
talk?
It
puzzles
myself
sometimes.
The
more
crane,
malin,
taquin
is
her
mood,
consequently
the
clearer
occasion
she
gives
me
for
disapprobation,
the
more
I
seek
her,
the
better
I
like
her.
She
is
never
wilder
than
when
equipped
in
her
habit
and
hat,
never
less
manageable
than
when
she
and
Zoe
come
in
fiery
from
a
race
with
the
wind
on
the
hills;
and
I
confess
it
to
this
mute
page
I
may
confess
it
I
have
waited
an
hour
