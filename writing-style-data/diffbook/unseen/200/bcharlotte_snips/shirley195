raise
him
in
the
estimation
of
Miss
Helstone
or
of
any
other
lady
who
heard
him;
whereas
with
her,
at
least,
they
brought
him
to
a
level
below
contempt,
though
sometimes,
indeed,
they
incensed
her;
for,
a
Yorkshire
girl
herself,
she
hated
to
hear
Yorkshire
abused
by
such
a
pitiful
prater;
and
when
wrought
up
to
a
certain
pitch,
she
would
turn
and
say
something
of
which
neither
the
matter
nor
the
manner
recommended
her
to
Mr.
Donne's
good
will.
She
would
tell
him
it
was
no
proof
of
refinement
to
be
ever
scolding
others
for
vulgarity,
and
no
sign
of
a
good
pastor
to
be
eternally
censuring
his
flock.
She
would
ask
him
what
he
had
entered
the
church
for,
since
he
complained
there
were
only
cottages
to
visit,
and
poor
people
to
preach
to
whether
he
had
been
ordained
to
the
ministry
merely
to
wear
soft
clothing
and
sit
in
king's
houses.
These
questions
were
considered
by
all
the
curates
as,
to
the
last
degree,
audacious
and
impious.
Tea
was
a
long
time
in
progress;
all
the
guests
gabbled
as
their
hostess
had
expected
they
would.
Mr.
Helstone,
being
in
excellent
spirits
when,
indeed,
was
he
ever
otherwise
