we
were
alone
I
was
slow
to
disturb
her.
To
sit
with
her
in
sight
was
happiness,
and
the
proper
happiness,
for
early
morning
serene,
incomplete,
but
progressive.
Had
I
been
obtrusive,
I
knew
I
should
have
encountered
rebuff.
'Not
at
home
to
suitors'
was
written
on
her
brow.
Therefore
I
read
on,
stole
now
and
then
a
look,
watched
her
countenance
soften
and
open
as
she
felt
I
respected
her
mood,
and
enjoyed
the
gentle
content
of
the
moment.
"The
distance
between
us
shrank,
and
the
light
hoar
frost
thawed
insensibly.
Ere
an
hour
elapsed
I
was
at
her
side,
watching
her
sew,
gathering
her
sweet
smiles
and
her
merry
words,
which
fell
for
me
abundantly.
We
sat,
as
we
had
a
right
to
sit,
side
by
side;
my
arm
rested
on
her
chair;
I
was
near
enough
to
count
the
stitches
of
her
work,
and
to
discern
the
eye
of
her
needle.
The
door
suddenly
opened.
"I
believe,
if
I
had
just
then
started
from
her,
she
would
have
despised
me.
Thanks
to
the
phlegm
of
my
nature,
I
rarely
start.
When
I
am
well
off,
bien,
comfortable,
I
am
not
soon
stirred.
Bien
I
was
tres
bien
