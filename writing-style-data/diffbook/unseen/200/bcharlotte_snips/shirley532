the
questioner
by
requesting
to
be
conducted
home.
The
poor
invalid
was
already
fatigued.
Her
weariness
made
her
cross
too
cross
almost
to
speak
to
Caroline;
and
besides,
that
young
person's
white
dress
and
lively
look
were
displeasing
in
the
eyes
of
Miss
Mann.

all
others
went

pairs
or
parties;
so
she
approached
a
group
of
her
own
scholars,
great
girls,
or
rather
young
women,
who
were
