different
to
anything
of
which
you
have
an
idea.
I
make
no
pretension
to
be
better
than
my
fellows."
"If
you
did,
I
should
not
esteem
you
so
much.
It
is
because
you
are
modest
that
I
have
such
confidence
in
your
merit."
"Are

"By

"Just
so.
I
am
your
sincere
friend,
Robert."
"And
I
am
what
chance
and
change
shall
make
me,
Lina."
"Not
my
enemy,
however?"
The
answer
was
cut
short
by
Sarah
and
her
mistress
entering
the
kitchen
together
in
some
commotion.
They

been
improving

Moore
and
Miss
Helstone
