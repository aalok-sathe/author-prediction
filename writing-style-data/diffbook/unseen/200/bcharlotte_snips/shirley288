deliberate
but
so
unswerving,
so
circumspect
but
so
certain,
so
"unhasting"
but
so
"unresting;"
when
he
read
Lord
Wellington's
own
dispatches
in
the
columns
of
the
newspapers,
documents
written
by
modesty
to
the
dictation
of
truth
Moore
confessed
at
heart
that
a
power
was
with
the
troops
of
Britain,
of
that
vigilant,
enduring,
genuine,
unostentatious
sort,
which
must
win
victory
to
the
side
it
led,
in
the
end.
In
the
end!
But
that
end,
he
thought,
was
yet
far
off;
and
meantime
he,
Moore,
as
an
individual,
would
be
crushed,
his
hopes
ground
to
dust.
It
was
himself
he
had
to
care
for,
his
hopes
he
had
to
pursue;
and
he
would
fulfil
his
destiny.
He
fulfilled
it
so
vigorously
that
ere
long
he
came
to
a
decisive
rupture
with
his
old
Tory
friend
the
rector.
They
quarrelled
at
a
public
meeting,
and
afterwards
exchanged
some
pungent
letters
in
the
newspapers.
Mr.
Helstone
denounced
Moore
as
a
Jacobin,
ceased
to
see
him,
would
not
even
speak
to
him
when
they
met.
He
intimated
also
to
his
niece,
very
distinctly,
that
her
communications
with
Hollow's
Cottage
must
for
the
present
cease;
she
must
give
up
taking
French
lessons.
