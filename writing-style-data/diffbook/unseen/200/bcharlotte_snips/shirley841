learned
then?
What
new
circumstance?"
"I
have
learned
that
she
has
just
made
her
will."
"Made
her
will?"
The
tutor
and
pupil
were
silent.
"She
told
you
that?"
asked
Moore,
when
some
minutes
had
elapsed.
"She
told
me
quite
cheerfully,
not
as
an
ominous
circumstance,
which
I
felt
it
to
be.
She
said
I
was
the
only
person
besides
her
solicitor,
Pearson
Hall,
and
Mr.
Helstone
and
Mr.
Yorke,
who
knew
anything
about
it;
and
to
me,
she
intimated,
she
wished
specially
to
explain
its
provisions."
"Go
on,
Harry."
"'Because,'
she
said,
looking
down
on
me
with
her
beautiful
eyes
oh!
they
are
beautiful,
Mr.
Moore!
I
love
them!
I
love
her!
She
is
my
star!
Heaven
must
not
claim
her!
She
is
lovely
in
this
world,
and
fitted
for
this
world.
Shirley
is
not
an
angel;
she
is
a
woman,
and
she
shall
live
with
men.
Seraphs
shall
not
have
her!
Mr.
Moore,
if
one
of
the
'sons
of
God,'
with
wings
wide
and
bright
as
the
sky,
blue
and
sounding
as
the
sea,
having
seen
that
she
was
fair,
descended
to
claim
her,
his
claim
should
be
withstood
withstood
by
me
boy
and
cripple
as
I
am."
