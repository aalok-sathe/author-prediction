been
fretting
his
companion
previously,
and
now,
braced
up
by
the
raw
breeze,
and
perhaps
irritated
by
the
sharp
drizzle,
he
began
to
goad
him.
"Does
your
Peninsular
news
please
you
still?"
he
asked.
"What
do
you
mean?"
was
the
surly
demand
of
the
rector.
"I
mean,
have
you
still
faith
in
that
Baal
of
a
Lord
Wellington?"
"And
what
do
you

be
serious
in
what
you
say.
Bonaparte's
marshals
are
great
men,
who
act
under
the
guidance
of
an
omnipotent
master
spirit.
Your
Wellington
is
the
most
humdrum
of
commonplace
martinets,
whose
slow,
mechanical
movements
are
further
cramped
by
an
ignorant
home
government."
"Wellington
is
the
soul
of
England.
Wellington
is
the
right
champion
of
a
good
cause,
the
fit
representative
of
a
powerful,
a
resolute,
a
sensible,
and
an
honest
nation."
"Your
good
cause,

I
