all
those
gentlemen
gather
round
you?
Put
away
reserve
for
once.
Be
frank
with
me."
"Who
can
resist
you?
I
will
be
frank.
To
morrow,
if
there
is
anything
to
relate,
you
shall
hear
it."
"Just
now,"
pleaded
Shirley;
"don't
procrastinate."
"But
I

of
the
head
and
a
gentle,
serious
smile.
He
sought
no

cordial
token.
Again
he
said
"Farewell,"
and
quitted
them
both.
"There!
it
is
over,"
said
Shirley
when
he
was
gone.
"We
have
made
him
bid
us
good
night,
and
yet
not
lost
