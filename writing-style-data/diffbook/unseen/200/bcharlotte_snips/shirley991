a
spiritual
song
a
tall
class
of
young
women
came
quietly
in,
closing
the
procession.
Their
teacher,
having
seen
them
seated,
passed
into
the
rectory
pew.
The
French
gray
cloak
and
small
beaver
bonnet
were
known
to
Martin;
it
was
the
very
costume
his
eyes
had
ached
to
catch.
Miss
Helstone
had
not
suffered
the
storm
to
prove
an
impediment.
After
all,
she
was
come
to
church.
Martin
probably
whispered
his
satisfaction
to
his
hymn
book;
at
any
rate,
he
therewith
hid
his
face
two
minutes.
Satisfied
or
not,
he
had
time
to
get
very
angry
with
her
again
before
the
sermon
was
over.
She
had
never
once
looked
his
way;
at
least
he
had
not
been
so
lucky
as
to
encounter
a
glance.
"If,"
he
said
"if
she
takes
no
notice
of
me,
if
she
shows
I
am
not
in
her
thoughts,
I
shall
have
a
worse,
a
meaner
opinion
of
her
than
ever.
Most
despicable
would
it
be
to
come
for
the
sake
of
those
sheep
faced
Sunday
scholars,
and
not
for
my
sake
or
that
long
skeleton
Moore's."
The
sermon
found
an
end;
the
benediction
was
pronounced;
the
congregation
dispersed.
She
had
not
been
near
him.
Now,
