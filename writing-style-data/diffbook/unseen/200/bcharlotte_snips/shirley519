left
sitting
in
the
ditch.
He
was
a
spirit
merchant
by
trade,
a
leader
of
the
Nonconformists,
and,
it
was
said,
drank
more
water
in
that
one
afternoon
than
he
had
swallowed
for
a
twelvemonth
before.
Mr.
Hall
had
taken
care
of
Caroline,
and
Caroline
of
him.
He
and
Miss
Ainley
made
their
own
quiet
comments
to
each
other
afterwards
on
the
incident.
Miss
Keeldar
and
Mr.
Helstone
shook
hands
heartily
when
they
had
fairly
got
the
whole
party
through
the
lane.
The
curates
began
to
exult,
but
Mr.
Helstone
presently
put
the
curb
on
their
innocent
spirits.
He
remarked
that
they
never
had
sense
to
know
what
to
say,
and
had
better
hold
their
tongues;
and
he
reminded
them
that
the
business
was
none
of
their
managing.
About
half
past
three
the
procession
turned
back,
and
at
four
once
more
regained
the
starting
place.
Long
lines
of
benches
were
arranged
in
the
close
shorn
fields
round
the
school.
There
the
children
were
seated,
and
huge
baskets,
covered
up
with
white
cloths,
and
great
smoking
tin
vessels
were
brought
out.
Ere
the
distribution
of
good
things
commenced,
a
brief
grace
was
pronounced
by
Mr.
Hall
and
sung
by
the
children.
