wife,
over
whom
he
tyrannizes
in
trifles,
guides
him
in
matters
of
importance.
I
have
long
since
earned
her
undying
mother's
gratitude
by
my
devotion
to
her
boy.
In
some
of
Henry's
ailments
I
have
nursed
him
better,
she
said,
than
any
woman
could
nurse.
She
will
never
forget
that.
She
and
her
daughters
quitted
me
to
day,
in
mute
wrath
and
consternation;
but
she
respects
me.
When
Henry
clung
to
my
neck
as
I
lifted
him
into
the
carriage
and
placed
him
by
her
side,
when
I
arranged
her
own
wrapping
to
make
her
warm,
though
she
turned
her
head
from
me,
I
saw
the
tears
start
to
her
eyes.
She
will
but
the
more
zealously
advocate
my
cause
because
she
has
left
me
in
anger.
I
am
glad
of
this
not
for
my
own
sake,
but
for
that
of
my
life
and
idol
my
Shirley."
Once
again
he
writes,
a
week
after:
"I
am
now
at
Stilbro'.
I
have
taken
up
my
temporary
abode
with
a
friend
a
professional
man,
in
whose
business
I
can
be
useful.
Every
day
I
ride
over
to
Fieldhead.
How
long
will
it
be
before
I
can
call
that
place
my
home,
and
