do
it
well.
Fold
it
up;
put
it
carefully
in
your
bag;
then
step
into
the
kitchen
and
desire
Sarah
to
bring
in
the
gouter,
or
tea,
as
you
call
it."
"But
it
has
not
yet
struck
six.
He
may
still
come."
"He
will
not,
I
tell
you.
I
can
calculate
his
movements.
I
understand
my
brother."
Suspense
is
irksome,
disappointment
bitter.
All
the
world
has,
some
time
or
other,
felt
that.
Caroline,
obedient
to
orders,
passed
into
the
kitchen.
Sarah
was
making
a
dress
for
herself
at
the
table.
"You
are
to
bring
in
coffee,"
said
the
young
lady
in
a
spiritless
tone;
and
then
she
leaned
her
arm
and
head
against
the
kitchen
mantelpiece,
and
hung
listlessly
over
the
fire.
"How
low
you
seem,
miss!
But
it's
all
because
your
cousin
keeps
you
so
close
to
work.
It's
a
shame!"
"Nothing
of
the
kind,
Sarah,"
was
the
brief
reply.
"Oh!
but
I
know
it
is.
You're
fit
to
cry
just
this
minute,
for
nothing
else
but
because
you've
sat
still
the
whole
day.
It
would
make
a
kitten
dull
to
be
mewed
up
so."
"Sarah,
does
your
master
often
come
home
early
from
market
when
it
is
wet?"
