He
was
resolved,
he
said,
to
return
home
to
the
Hollow
that
very
afternoon.
Mr.
Yorke,
instead
of
opposing,
aided
and
abetted
him.
The
chaise
was
sent
for,
though
Mrs.
Yorke
declared
the
step
would
be
his
death.
It
came.
Moore,
little
disposed
to
speak,
made
his
purse
do
duty
for
his
tongue.
He
expressed
his
gratitude
to
the
servants
and
to
Mrs.
Horsfall
by
the
chink
of
his
coin.
The
latter
personage
approved
and
understood
this
language
perfectly;
it
made
amends
for
all
previous
contumacy.
She
and
her
patient
parted
the
best
friends
in
the

kitchen
visited
and
soothed,
Moore
betook

to
the
parlour.
He

Mrs.
Yorke

of
her
housemaids.
There
she
sat
plunged
in
sullen
dudgeon,
the
gloomiest
speculations
on
the
depths
of
man's
ingratitude
absorbing
her
thoughts.
He
drew
near
and
bent
over
her;
she
was
obliged
to
look
up,
if
it
were
only
to
bid
him
"avaunt."
There
was
beauty
still
in
his
pale,
wasted
features;
there
was
earnestness
and
a
sort
of
sweetness
for
he
was
smiling
in
his
hollow
eyes.
"Good
bye!"
he
said,
and
as
he
spoke
the
