him
no
longer
"a
mad
girl,"
but
a
"most
sensible
woman."
He
termed
her,
in
confidential
dialogues
with
Mrs.
Sympson,
"a
truly
superior
person;
peculiar,
but
very
clever."
He
treated
her
with
exceeding
deference;
rose
reverently
to
open
and
shut
doors
for
her;
reddened
his
face
and
gave
himself
headaches
with
stooping
to
pick
up
gloves,
handkerchiefs,
and
other
loose
property,
whereof
Shirley
usually
held
but
insecure
tenure.
He
would
cut
mysterious
jokes
about
the
superiority
of
woman's
wit
over
man's
wisdom;
commence
obscure
apologies
for
the
blundering
mistake
he
had
committed
respecting
the
generalship,
the
tactics,
of
"a
personage
not
a
hundred
miles
from
Fieldhead."
In
short,
he
seemed
elate
as
any
"midden
cock
on
pattens."
His
niece
viewed
his
maneauvres
and
received
his
innuendoes
with
phlegm;
apparently
she
did
not
above
half
comprehend
to
what
aim
they
tended.
When
plainly
charged
with
being
the
preferred
of
the
baronet,
she
said
she
believed
he
did
like
her,
and
for
her
part
she
liked
him.
She
had
never
thought
a
man
of
rank
the
only
son
of
a
proud,
fond
mother,
the
only
brother
of
doting
sisters
could
have
so
much
goodness,
and,
on
the
whole,
so
much
sense.
