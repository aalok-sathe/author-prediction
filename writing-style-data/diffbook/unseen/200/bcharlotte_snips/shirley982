me
up."
"I
deserve
to
hear
that
in
a
moment
when
I
can
scarce
lift
my
hand
to
my
head.
I
deserve
it."
"It
is
no
reproach
against
you."
"It
is
a
coal
of
fire
heaped
on
my
head;
and
so
is
every
word
you
address
to
me,
and
every
look
that
lights
your
sweet
face.
Come
still
nearer,
Lina;
and
give
me
your
hand
if
my
thin
fingers
do
not
scare
you."
She
took
those
thin
fingers
between
her
two
little
hands;
she
bent
her
head
et
les
effleura
de
ses
levres.
(I
put
that
in
French
because
the
word
effleurer
is
an
exquisite
word.)
Moore
was
much
moved.
A
large
tear
or
two
coursed
down
his
hollow
cheek.
"I'll
keep
these
things
in
my
heart,
Cary;
that
kiss
I
will
put
by,
and
you
shall
hear
of
it
again
one
day."
"Come
out!"
cried
Martin,
opening
the
door
"come
away;
you
have
had
twenty
minutes
instead
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour."
"She
will
not
stir
yet,
you
hempseed."
"I
dare
not
stay
longer,
Robert."
"Can
you
promise
to
return?"
"No,
she
can't,"
responded
Martin.
"The
thing
mustn't
become
customary.
I
can't
be
troubled.
It's
very
well
for
