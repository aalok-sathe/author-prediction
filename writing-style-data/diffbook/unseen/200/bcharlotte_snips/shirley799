before
them,
and
the
scented
shade
of
gardens
spread
round,
and
the
tall
shelter
of
cliffs
rose
behind
them,
he
would
pull
out
his
last
batch
of
sonnets,
and
read
them
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
emotion.
He
did
not
seem
to
know
that
though
they
might
be
rhyme
they
were
not
poetry.
It
appeared,
by
Shirley's
downcast
eye
and
disturbed
face,
that
she
knew
it,
and
felt
heartily
mortified
by
the
single
foible
of
this
good
and
amiable
gentleman.
Often
she
tried,
as
gently
as
might
be,
to
wean
him
from
this
fanatic
worship
of
the
Muses.
It
was
his
monomania;
on
all
ordinary
subjects
he
was
sensible
enough,
and
fain
was
she
to
engage
him
in
ordinary
topics.
He
questioned
her
sometimes
about
his
place
at
Nunnely;
she
was
but
too
happy
to
answer
his
interrogatories
at
length.
She
never
wearied
of
describing
the
antique
priory,
the
wild
silvan
park,
the
hoary
church
and
hamlet;
nor
did
she
fail
to
counsel
him
to
come
down
and
gather
his
tenantry
about
him
in
his
ancestral
halls.
Somewhat
to
her
surprise,
Sir
Philip
followed
her
advice
to
the
letter,
and
actually,
towards
the
close
of
September,
arrived
at
the
priory.
