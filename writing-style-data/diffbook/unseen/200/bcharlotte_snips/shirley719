pain
to
see
were
now
relaxed
in
sleep.
Mrs.
Pryor
gently
disengaged
the
braid,
drawing
out
a
tiny
locket
a
slight
thing
it
was,
such
as
it
suited
her
small
purse
to
purchase.
Under
its
crystal
face
appeared
a
curl
of
black
hair,
too
short
and
crisp
to
have
been
severed
from
a
female
head.
Some
agitated
movement
occasioned
a
twitch
of
the
silken
chain.
The
sleeper
started
and
woke.
Her
thoughts
were
usually
now
somewhat
scattered
on
waking,
her
look
generally
wandering.
Half
rising,
as
if
in
terror,
she
exclaimed,
"Don't
take
it
from
me,
Robert!
Don't!
It
is
my
last
comfort;
let
me
keep
it.
I
never
tell
any
one
whose
hair
it
is;
I
never
show
it."
Mrs.
Pryor
had
already
disappeared
behind
the
curtain.
Reclining
far
back
in
a
deep
arm
chair
by
the
bedside,
she
was
withdrawn
from
view.
Caroline
looked
abroad
into
the
chamber;
she
thought
it
empty.
As
her
stray
ideas
returned
slowly,
each
folding
its
weak
wings
on
the
mind's
sad
shore,
like
birds
exhausted,
beholding
void,
and
perceiving
silence
round
her,
she
believed
herself
alone.
Collected
she
was
not
yet;
perhaps
healthy
self
possession
and
self
control
were
to
be
hers
