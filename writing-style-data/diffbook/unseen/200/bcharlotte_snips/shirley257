In
a
low
voice
he
pleads,
"Mark
and
Martin,
don't
anger
your
brother."
And
this
is
ever
the
tone
adopted
by
both
parents.
Theoretically,
they
decry
partiality
no
rights
of
primogeniture
are
to
be
allowed
in
that
house;
but
Matthew
is
never
to
be
vexed,
never
to
be
opposed;
they
avert
provocation
from
him
as
assiduously
as
they
would
avert
fire
from
a
barrel
of
gunpowder.
"Concede,

Mark
is
a
bonny
looking
boy,
the
most
regular
featured
of
the
family.
He
is
exceedingly
calm;
his
smile
is
shrewd;
he
can
say
the
driest,
most
cutting
things
in
the
quietest
of
tones.
Despite
his
tranquillity,
a
somewhat
heavy
brow
speaks
temper,
and
reminds
you
that
the
smoothest
waters
are
not
always
the
safest.
Besides,

unmoved,
phlegmatic,
