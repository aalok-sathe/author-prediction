be
assembled
for
a
like
festal
purpose;
the
schools
have
a
grand
treat.
This
morning
there
were
two
marriages
solemnized
in
Briarfield
church
Louis
Gerard
Moore,
Esq.,
late
of
Antwerp,
to
Shirley,
daughter
of
the
late
Charles
Cave
Keeldar,
Esq.,
of
Fieldhead;
Robert
Gerard
Moore,
Esq.,
of
Hollow's
Mill,
to
Caroline,
niece
of
the
Rev.
Matthewson
Helstone,
M.A.,
rector
of
Briarfield.
The
ceremony,
in
the
first
instance,
was
performed
by
Mr.
Helstone,
Hiram
Yorke,
Esq.,
of
Briarmains,
giving
the
bride
away.
In
the
second
instance,
Mr.
Hall,
vicar
of
Nunnely,
officiated.
Amongst
the
bridal
train
the
two
most
noticeable
personages
were
the
youthful
bridesmen,
Henry
Sympson
and
Martin
Yorke.
I
suppose
Robert
Moore's
prophecies
were,
partially
at
least,
fulfilled.
The
other
day
I
passed
up
the
Hollow,
which
tradition
says
was
once
green,
and
lone,
and
wild;
and
there
I
saw
the
manufacturer's
day
dreams
embodied
in
substantial
stone
and
brick
and
ashes
the
cinder
black
highway,
the
cottages,
and
the
cottage
gardens;
there
I
saw
a
mighty
mill,
and
a
chimney
ambitious
as
the
tower
of
Babel.
I
told
my
old
housekeeper
when
I
came
home
where
I
had
been.
"Ay,"
said
she,
"this
world
has
queer
changes.
