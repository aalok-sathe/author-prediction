consideration,
wanting
docility,
but
sound,
spirited,
and
true
bred
as
the
eagle
on
the
cliff
or
the
steed
in
the
steppe.
A
low
tap
is
heard
at
the
parlour
door;
the
boys
have
been
making
such
a
noise
over
their
game,
and
little
Jessy,
besides,
has
been
singing
so
sweet
a
Scotch
song
to
her
father
who
delights
in
Scotch
and
Italian
songs,
and
has
taught
his
musical
little
daughter
some
of
the
best
that
the
ring
at
the
outer
door
was
not
observed.
"Come
in,"
says
Mrs.
Yorke,
in
that
conscientiously
constrained
and
solemnized
voice
of
hers,
which
ever
modulates
itself
to
a
funereal
dreariness
of
tone,
though
the
subject
it
is
exercised
upon
be
but
to
give
orders
for
the
making
of
a
pudding
in
the
kitchen,
to
bid
the
boys
hang
up
their
caps
in
the
hall,
or
to
call
the
girls
to
their
sewing
"come
in!"
And
in
came
Robert
Moore.
Moore's
habitual
gravity,
as
well
as
his
abstemiousness
(for
the
case
of
spirit
decanters
is
never
ordered
up
when
he
pays
an
evening
visit),
has
so
far
recommended
him
to
Mrs.
Yorke
that
she
has
not
yet
made
him
the
subject
of
private
animadversions
with
