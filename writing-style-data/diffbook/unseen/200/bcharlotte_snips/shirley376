nobody
else
had:
she
was
still
such
a
stay,
such
a
counsellor,
so
truthful,
so
kind
in
her
way,
that,
in
Caroline's
idea,
none
once
accustomed
to
her
presence
could
easily
afford
to
dispense
with
it.
As
to
dependency
or
humiliation,
Caroline
did
not
feel
it
in
her
intercourse
with
Shirley,
and
why
should
Mrs.
Pryor?
The
heiress
was
rich
very
rich
compared
with
her
new
friend:
one
possessed
a
clear
thousand
a
year,
the
other
not
a
penny;
and
yet
there
was
a
safe
sense
of
equality
experienced
in
her
society,
never
known
in
that
of
the
ordinary
Briarfield
and
Whinbury
gentry.
The
reason
was,
Shirley's
head
ran
on
other
things
than
money
and
position.
She
was
glad
to
be
independent
as
to
property;
by
fits
she
was
even
elated
at
the
notion
of
being
lady
of
the
manor,
and
having
tenants
and
an
estate.
She
was
especially
tickled
with
an
agreeable
complacency
when
reminded
of
"all
that
property"
down
in
the
Hollow,
"comprising
an
excellent
cloth
mill,
dyehouse,
warehouse,
together
with
the
messuage,
gardens,
and
outbuildings,
termed
Hollow's
Cottage;"
but
her
exultation
being
quite
undisguised
was
singularly
inoffensive;
and,
for
her
serious
thoughts,
they
tended
elsewhere.
