a
large,
servant
like
black
apron,
which
spoiled
everything.
On
no
account
would
mademoiselle
have
appeared
in
her
own
house
without
the
thick
handkerchief
and
the
voluminous
apron.
The
first
was
a
positive
matter
of
morality
it
was
quite
improper
not
to
wear
a
fichu;
the
second
was
the
ensign
of
a
good
housewife
she
appeared
to
think
that
by
means
of
it
she
somehow
effected
a
large
saving
in
her
brother's
income.
She
had,
with
her
own

made
and
presented
to
Caroline
similar
equipments;
and
the
only
serious
quarrel

and
profit
by
these
elegant
presents.
"I
wear
a
high

said
Caroline,
"and
I
should
feel
suffocated
with
a
handkerchief
in
addition;
and
my
short
aprons
do
quite
as
well
as
that
very
long
one.
I
would
rather
make
no
change."
Yet
Hortense,
by
dint
of
perseverance,
would
probably
have
compelled
her
to
make
a
change,
had
not
Mr.
Moore
chanced
to
overhear
a
dispute
on
the
subject,
and
decided
that
Caroline's
little
aprons
would
suffice,
and
that,
