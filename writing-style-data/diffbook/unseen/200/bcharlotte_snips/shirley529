have
offended
either
gentleman
for
the
world,"
she
averred.
"I
have
always
been
accustomed
to
treat
both
with
the
most
respectful
consideration,
and
there,
owing
to
you,
how
they
have
been
used!
I
shall
not
be
happy
till
I
have
made
it
up.
I
never
am
happy
till
I
am
friends
with
my
neighbours.
So
to

I

Sam's
favourite
pointers."

fine
speech

of
gratification,
and
offered
no
apology
for
the
trouble
he
had
given.
His
phlegm
became
him
wonderfully.
It
made
him
look
handsomer,
he
was
so
composed;
it
made
his
vicinage
pleasant,
it
was
so
peace
restoring.
You
would
not
have
thought,
to
look
at
him,
that
he
was
a
poor,
struggling
man
seated
beside
a
rich
woman;
the
calm
of
equality
