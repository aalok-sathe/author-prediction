became
ciphers
in
the
sick
room.
Mrs.
Pryor
made
it
her
domain;
she
performed
all
its
duties;
she
lived
in
it
day
and
night.
The
patient
remonstrated
faintly,
however,
from
the
first,
and
not
at
all
ere
long.
Loneliness
and
gloom
were
now
banished
from
her
bedside;
protection
and
solace
sat
there
instead.
She
and
her
nurse
coalesced
in
wondrous
union.
Caroline
was
usually
pained
to
require
or
receive
much
attendance.
Mrs.
Pryor,
under
ordinary
circumstances,
had
neither
the
habit
nor
the
art
of
performing
little
offices
of
service;
but
all
now
passed
with
such
ease,
so
naturally,
that
the
patient
was
as
willing
to
be
cherished
as
the
nurse
was
bent
on
cherishing;
no
sign
of
weariness
in
the
latter
ever
reminded
the
former
that
she
ought
to
be
anxious.
There
was,
in
fact,
no
very
hard
duty
to
perform;
but
a
hireling
might
have
found
it
hard.
With
all
this
care
it
seemed
strange
the
sick
girl
did
not
get
well;
yet
such
was
the
case.
She
wasted
like
any
snow
wreath
in
thaw;
she
faded
like
any
flower
in
drought.
Miss
Keeldar,
on
whose
thoughts
danger
or
death
seldom
intruded,
had
at
first
entertained
no
fears
