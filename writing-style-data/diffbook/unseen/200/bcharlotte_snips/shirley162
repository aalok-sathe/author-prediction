blood
must
gem
with
red
beads
the
brow
of
the
combatant,
before
the
wreath
of
victory
rustles
over
it.
At
eighteen
we
are
not
aware
of
this.
Hope,
when
she
smiles
on
us,
and
promises
happiness
to
morrow,
is
implicitly
believed;
Love,
when
he
comes
wandering
like
a
lost
angel
to
our
door,
is
at
once
admitted,
welcomed,
embraced.
His
quiver

not

if
his
arrows
penetrate,
their
wound
is
like
a
thrill
of
new
life.
There

no
fears

poison,

no

many,

to

an

good.
In

the
school

experience

to
be
entered,

her
humbling,
crushing,
grinding,

invigorating
lessons

learned.
Alas,
Experience!
No
other
mentor

frozen

face
as
yours,
none
wears
a
robe
so
black,
none
bears
a

none
with
hand

the
novice
so

and
forces
him
