Malone.
Moore
raised
his
hand.
"Chut!"
he
said
in
his
French
fashion,
as
Malone
made
a
noise
with
his
glass.
He
listened
a
moment,
then
rose,
put
his
hat
on,
and
went
out
at
the
counting
house
door.
The
night
was
still,
dark,
and
stagnant:
the
water
yet
rushed
on
full
and
fast;
its
flow
almost
seemed
a
flood
in
the
utter
silence.
Moore's
ear,
however,
caught
another
sound,
very
distant
but
yet
dissimilar,
broken
and
rugged
in
short,
a
sound
of
heavy
wheels
crunching
a
stony
road.
He
returned
to
the
counting
house
and
lit
a
lantern,
with
which
he
walked
down
the
mill
yard,
and
proceeded
to
open
the
gates.
The
big
wagons
were
coming
on;
the
dray
horses'
huge
hoofs
were
heard
splashing
in
the
mud
and
water.
Moore
hailed
them.
"Hey,
Joe
Scott!
Is
all
right?"
Probably
Joe
Scott
was
yet
at
too
great
a
distance
to
hear
the
inquiry.
He
did
not
answer
it.
"Is
all
right,
I
say?"
again
asked
Moore,
when
the
elephant
like
leader's
nose
almost
touched
his.
Some
one
jumped
out
from
the
foremost
wagon
into
the
road;
a
voice
cried
aloud,
"Ay,
ay,
divil;
all's
raight!
We've
smashed
'em."
And
