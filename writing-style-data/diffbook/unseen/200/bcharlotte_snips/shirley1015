as
'I
love
this
man
or
that'
passed
her
lips."
"I
thought
not."
"But
the
feeling
made
its
way
in
spite
of
her,
and
I
saw
it.
She
spoke
of
one
man
in
a
strain
not
to
be
misunderstood.
Her
voice
alone
was
sufficient
testimony.
Having
wrung
from
her
an
opinion
on
your
character,
I
demanded
a
second
opinion
of
another
person
about
whom
I
had
my
conjectures,
though
they
were
the
most
tangled
and
puzzled
conjectures
in
the
world.
I
would
make
her
speak.
I
shook
her,
I
chid
her,
I
pinched
her
fingers
when
she
tried
to
put
me
off
with
gibes
and
jests
in
her
queer
provoking
way,
and
at
last
out
it
came.
The
voice,
I
say,
was
enough;
hardly
raised
above
a
whisper,
and
yet
such
a
soft
vehemence
in
its
tones.
There
was
no
confession,
no
confidence,
in
the
matter.
To
these
things
she
cannot
condescend;
but
I
am
sure
that
man's
happiness
is
dear
to
her
as
her
own
life."
"Who
is
it?"
"I
charged
her
with
the
fact.
She
did
not
deny,
she
did
not
avow,
but
looked
at
me.
I
saw
her
eyes
by
the
snow
gleam.
It
was
quite
enough.
