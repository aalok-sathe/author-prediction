to
effect
a
radical
reform,
which
he
had
executed
as
fast
as
his
very
limited
capital
would
allow;
and
the
narrowness
of
that
capital,
and
consequent
check
on
his
progress,
was
a
restraint
which
galled
his
spirit
sorely.
Moore
ever
wanted
to
push
on.
"Forward"
was
the
device
stamped
upon
his
soul;
but
poverty
curbed
him.
Sometimes
(figuratively)
he
foamed
at
the
mouth
when
the
reins
were
drawn
very
tight.
In
this
state
of
feeling,
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
he
would
deliberate
much
as
to
whether
his
advance
was
or
was
not
prejudicial
to
others.
Not
being
a
native,
nor
for
any
length
of
time
a
resident
of
the
neighbourhood,
he
did
not
sufficiently
care
when
the
new
inventions
threw
the
old
workpeople
out
of
employ.
He
never
asked
himself
where
those
to
whom
he
no
longer
paid
weekly
wages
found
daily
bread;
and
in
this
negligence
he
only
resembled
thousands
besides,
on
whom
the
starving
poor
of
Yorkshire
seemed
to
have
a
closer
claim.
The
period
of
which
I
write
was
an
overshadowed
one
in
British
history,
and
especially
in
the
history
of
the
northern
provinces.
War
was
then
at
its
height.
Europe
was
all
involved
