to
the
commission
of
matrimony,
and
which
Miss
Cave
did
not
find
in
any
of
the
young
wool
staplers,
her
other
adorers.
Mr.
Helstone
neither
had,
nor
professed
to
have,
Mr.
Yorke's
absorbing
passion
for
her.
He
had
none
of
the
humble
reverence
which
seemed
to
subdue
most
of
her
suitors;
he
saw
her
more
as
she
really
was
than
the
rest
did.
He
was,
consequently,
more
master
of
her
and
himself.
She
accepted
him
at
the
first
offer,
and
they
were
married.
Nature
never
intended
Mr.
Helstone
to
make
a
very
good
husband,
especially
to
a
quiet
wife.
He
thought
so
long
as
a
woman
was
silent
nothing
ailed
her,
and
she
wanted
nothing.
If
she
did
not
complain
of
solitude,
solitude,
however
continued,
could
not
be
irksome
to
her.
If
she
did
not
talk
and
put
herself
forward,
express
a
partiality
for
this,
an
aversion
to
that,
she
had
no
partialities
or
aversions,
and
it
was
useless
to
consult
her
tastes.
He
made
no
pretence
of
comprehending
women,
or
comparing
them
with
men.
They
were
a
different,
probably
a
very
inferior,
order
of
existence.
A
wife
could
not
be
her
husband's
companion,
much
less
his
confidante,
much
less
