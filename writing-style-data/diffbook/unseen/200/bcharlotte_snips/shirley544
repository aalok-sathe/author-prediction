observes
our
absence."
"I
will
bear
the
brunt
of
his
wrath;
he
will
not
devour
me.
I
shall
be
sorry
to
miss
his
pungent
speech.
I
know
it
will
be
all
sense
for
the
church,
and
all
causticity
for
schism.
He'll
not
forget
the
battle
of
Royd
Lane.
I
shall
be
sorry
also
to
deprive
you
of
Mr.
Hall's
sincere
friendly
homily,
with
all
its
racy
Yorkshireisms;
but
here
I
must
stay.
The
gray
church
and
grayer
tombs
look
divine
with
this
crimson
gleam
on
them.
Nature
is
now
at
her
evening
prayers;
she
is
kneeling
before
those
red
hills.
I
see
her
prostrate
on
the
great
steps
of
her
altar,
praying
for
a
fair
night
for
mariners
at
sea,
for
travellers
in
deserts,
for
lambs
on
moors,
and
unfledged
birds
in
woods.
Caroline,
I
see
her,
and
I
will
tell
you
what
she
is
like.
She
is
like
what
Eve
was
when
she
and
Adam
stood
alone
on
earth."
"And
that
is
not
Milton's
Eve,
Shirley."
"Milton's
Eve!
Milton's
Eve!
I
repeat.
No,
by
the
pure
Mother
of
God,
she
is
not!
Cary,
we
are
alone;
we
may
speak
what
we
think.
Milton
was
great;
but
was
he
good?
