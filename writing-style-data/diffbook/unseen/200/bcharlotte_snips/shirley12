resulted
in
nothing,
and
that,
on
whatever
terms
the
curates
might
part
to
night,
they
would
be
sure
to
meet
the
best
friends
in
the
world
to
morrow
morning.
As
the
worthy
pair
were
sitting
by
their
kitchen
fire,
listening
to
the
repeated
and
sonorous
contact
of
Malone's
fist
with
the
mahogany
plane
of
the
parlour
table,
and
to
the
consequent
start
and
jingle
of
decanters
and
glasses

I
could

sir?"
"I
want
to
know
first
whether
it
is
worth
my

walking
in.
Whom
have
you

"The
curates,
sir."
"What!
all
of
them?"
"Yes,
sir."
"Been
