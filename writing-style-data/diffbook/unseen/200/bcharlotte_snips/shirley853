you
lost
sleep,
appetite,
and
flesh,"
proceeded
Moore,
"but
your
spirits
are
always
at
ebb.
Besides,
there
is
a
nervous
alarm
in
your
eye,
a
nervous
disquiet
in
your
manner.
These
peculiarities
were
not
formerly
yours."
"Mr.
Moore,
we
will
pause
here.
You
have
exactly
hit
it.
I
am
nervous.
Now,
talk
of
something
else.
What
wet
weather
we
have
steady,
pouring
rain!"
"You
nervous?
Yes;
and
if
Miss
Keeldar
is
nervous,
it
is
not
without
a
cause.
Let
me
reach
it.
Let
me
look
nearer.
The
ailment
is
not
physical.
I
have
suspected
that.
It
came
in
one
moment.
I
know
the
day.
I
noticed
the
change.
Your
pain
is
mental."
"Not
at
all.
It
is
nothing
so
dignified
merely
nervous.
Oh!
dismiss
the
topic."
"When
it
is
exhausted;
not
till
then.
Nervous
alarms
should
always
be
communicated,
that
they
may
be
dissipated.
I
wish
I
had
the
gift
of
persuasion,
and
could
incline
you
to
speak
willingly.
I
believe
confession,
in
your
case,
would
be
half
equivalent
to
cure."
"No,"
said
Shirley
abruptly.
"I
wish
that
were
at
all
probable;
but
I
am
afraid
it
is
not."
She
suspended
her
work
a
moment.
She
was
now
seated.
