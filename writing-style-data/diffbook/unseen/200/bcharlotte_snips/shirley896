When
others
uttered
it
she
changed
countenance
I
know
she
did.
She
pronounced
it
herself
in
the
most
musical
of
her
many
musical
tones.
She
was
cordial
to
me;
she
took
an
interest
in
me;
she
was
anxious
about
me;
she
wished
me
well;
she
sought,
she
seized
every
opportunity
to
benefit
me.
I
considered,
paused,
watched,
weighed,
wondered.
I
could
come
to
but
one
conclusion
this
is
love.
"I
looked
at
her,
Yorke.
I
saw
in
her
youth
and
a
species
of
beauty.
I
saw
power
in
her.
Her
wealth
offered
me
the
redemption
of
my
honour
and
my
standing.
I
owed
her
gratitude.
She
had
aided
me
substantially
and
effectually
by
a
loan
of
five
thousand
pounds.
Could
I
remember
these
things?
Could
I
believe
she
loved
me?
Could
I
hear
wisdom
urge
me
to
marry
her,
and
disregard
every
dear
advantage,
disbelieve
every
flattering
suggestion,
disdain
every
well
weighed
counsel,
turn
and
leave
her?
Young,
graceful,
gracious
my
benefactress,
attached
to
me,
enamoured
of
me.
I
used
to
say
so
to
myself;
dwell
on
the
word;
mouth
it
over
and
over
again;
swell
over
it
with
a
pleasant,
pompous
complacency,
with
an
admiration
dedicated
entirely
to
myself,
