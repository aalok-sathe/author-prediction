right
hand
which
all
this
while
had
lain
hidden
in
Moore's
breast,
reappearing,
held
out
a
pistol.
"Both
barrels
are
loaded,"
said
he.
"I'm
quite
determined!
Keep
off!"
Stepping
backwards,
facing
the
foe
as
he
went,
he
guarded
his
prey
to
the
counting
house.
He
ordered
Joe
Scott
to
pass
in
with
Sugden
and
the
prisoner,
and
to
bolt
the
door
inside.
For
himself,
he
walked
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
front
of
the
mill,
looking
meditatively
on
the
ground,
his
hand
hanging
carelessly
by
his
side,
but
still
holding
the
pistol.
The
eleven
remaining
deputies
watched
him
some
time,
talking
under
their
breath
to
each
other.
At
length
one
of
them
approached.
This
man
looked
very
different
from
either
of
the
two
who
had
previously
spoken;
he
was
hard
favoured,
but
modest
and
manly
looking.
"I've
not
much
faith
i'
Moses
Barraclough,"
said
he,
"and
I
would
speak
a
word
to
you
myseln,
Mr.
Moore.
It's
out
o'
no
ill
will
that
I'm
here,
for
my
part;
it's
just
to
mak
a
effort
to
get
things
straightened,
for
they're
sorely
a
crooked.
Ye
see
we're
ill
off
varry
ill
off;
wer
families
is
poor
and
pined.
We're
thrown
out
