Helstone
lifted

In
an
instant
out
clashed
the
eight
bells
in
the
tower,
loud
swelled
the
sounding
bands,
flute
spoke
and
clarion
answered,
deep
rolled
the
drums,
and
away
they
marched.
The
broad
white
road
unrolled
before
the
long
procession,
the
sun
and
sky
surveyed
it
cloudless,
the
wind
tossed
the
tree

the

of
which
it
was
composed
trod
on
in

all;
but
the
land
would
be
badly
off
without
them.
Britain
would
miss
her
church,
if
that
church
fell.
God
save
it!
God
also
reform
it!
Not
on
combat

nor
of
foemen

this
priest

their
