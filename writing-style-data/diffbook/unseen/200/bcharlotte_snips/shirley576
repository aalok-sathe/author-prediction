Her
heart
was
beating
fast
and
thick;
her
face
was
cold,
her
forehead
damp.
"Thank
God
for
us!"
she
reiterated.
"But
what
will
happen
elsewhere?
They
have
passed
us
by
that
they
may
make
sure
of
others."
"They
have
done
well,"
returned
Shirley,
with
composure.
"The
others
will
defend
themselves.
They
can
do
it.
They
are
prepared
for
them.
With
us
it
is
otherwise.
My
finger
was
on
the
trigger
of
this
pistol.
I
was
quite
ready
to
give
that
man,
if
he
had
entered,
such
a
greeting
as
he
little
calculated
on;
but
behind
him
followed
three
hundred.
I
had
neither
three
hundred
hands
nor
three
hundred
weapons.
I
could
not
have
effectually
protected
either
you,
myself,
or
the
two
poor
women
asleep
under
that
roof.
Therefore
I
again
earnestly
thank
God
for
insult
and
peril
escaped."
After
a
second
pause
she
continued:
"What
is
it
my
duty
and
wisdom
to
do
next?
Not
to
stay
here
inactive,
I
am
glad
to
say,
but,
of
course,
to
walk
over
to
the
Hollow."
"To
the
Hollow,
Shirley?"
"To
the
Hollow.
Will
you
go
with
me?"
"Where
those
men
are
gone?"
"They
have
taken
the
highway;
we
should
not
encounter
them.
