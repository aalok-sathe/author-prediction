morrow.
I
have
not
got
it;
he
would
not
give
it;
he
is
gone.
Strange
that
grief
should
now
almost
choke
me,
because
another
human
being's
eye
has
failed
to
greet
mine."
That
Sunday
evening,
Mr.
Malone
coming,
as
usual,
to
pass
it
with
his
rector,
Caroline
withdrew
after
tea
to
her
chamber.
Fanny,
knowing
her
habits,
had
lit
her
a
cheerful
little
fire,
as
the
weather
was
so
gusty
and
chill.
Closeted
there,
silent
and
solitary,
what
could
she
do
but
think?
She
noiselessly
paced
to
and
fro
the
carpeted
floor,
her
head
drooped,
her
hands
folded.
It
was
irksome
to
sit;
the
current
of
reflection
ran
rapidly
through
her
mind;
to
night
she
was
mutely
excited.
Mute
was
the
room,
mute
the
house.
The
double
door
of
the
study
muffled
the
voices
of
the
gentlemen.
The
servants
were
quiet
in
the
kitchen,
engaged
with
books
their
young
mistress
had
lent
them
books
which
she
had
told
them
were
"fit
for
Sunday
reading."
And
she
herself
had
another
of
the
same
sort
open
on
the
table,
but
she
could
not
read
it.
Its
theology
was
incomprehensible
to
her,
and
her
own
mind
was
too
busy,
teeming,
wandering,
to
listen
