the
disposing
of
those
chances
Which
he
was
lord
of?
or
whether
nature,
Not
to
be
other
than
one
thing,
not
moving
From
the
casque
to
the
cushion,
but
commanding
peace
Even
with
the
same
austerity
and
garb
As
he
controlled
the
war?'"
"Well,
answer
yourself,
Sphinx."
"It
was
a
spice
of
all;
and
you
must
not
be
proud
to
your
workpeople;
you
must
not
neglect
chances
of

"Who

"I

your
scorn
of
low
enemies,
your
resolution
not
'to

mob,'
as
he
says."
"And
