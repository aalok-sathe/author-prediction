partake?"
"Mr.
Hall"
it
was
Mr.
Hall,
and
with
him
was
Louis
Moore,
returned
from
their
walk
"there
is
a
proper
luncheon
laid
out
in
the
dining
room
and
there
are
proper
people
seated
round
it.
You
may
join
that
society
and
share
that
fare
if
you
please;
but
if
your
ill
regulated
tastes
lead
you
to
prefer
ill
regulated
proceedings,
step
in
here,
and
do
as
we
do."
"I
approve
the
perfume,
and
therefore
shall
suffer
myself
to
be
led
by
the
nose,"
returned
Mr.
Hall,
who
presently
entered,
accompanied
by
Louis
Moore.
That
gentleman's
eye
fell
on
his
desk,
pillaged.
"Burglars!"
said
he.
"Henry,
you
merit
the
ferule."
"Give
it
to
Shirley
and
Caroline;
they
did
it,"
was
alleged,
with
more
attention
to
effect
than
truth.
"Traitor
and
false
witness!"
cried
both
the
girls.
"We
never
laid
hands
on
a
thing,
except
in
the
spirit
of
laudable
inquiry!"
"Exactly
so,"
said
Moore,
with
his
rare
smile.
"And
what
have
you
ferreted
out,
in
your
'spirit
of
laudable
inquiry'?"
He
perceived
the
inner
drawer
open.
"This
is
empty,"
said
he.
"Who
has
taken
"
"Here,
here!"
Caroline
hastened
to
say,
and
she
restored
the
little
packet
to
its
place.
