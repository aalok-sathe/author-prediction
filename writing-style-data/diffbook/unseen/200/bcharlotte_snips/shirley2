the
first
dish
set
upon
the
table
shall
be
one
that
a
Catholic
ay,
even
an
Anglo
Catholic
might
eat
on
Good
Friday
in
Passion
Week:
it
shall
be
cold
lentils
and
vinegar
without
oil;
it
shall
be
unleavened
bread
with
bitter
herbs,
and
no
roast
lamb.
Of
late
years,
I
say,
an
abundant
shower
of
curates
has
fallen
upon
the
north
of
England;
but
in
eighteen
hundred
eleven
twelve
that
affluent
rain
had
not
descended.
Curates
were
scarce
then:
there
was
no
Pastoral
Aid
no
Additional
Curates'
Society
to
stretch
a
helping
hand
to
worn
out
old
rectors
and
incumbents,
and
give
them
the
wherewithal
to
pay
a
vigorous
young
colleague
from
Oxford
or
Cambridge.
The
present
successors
of
the
apostles,
disciples
of
Dr.
Pusey
and
tools
of
the
Propaganda,
were
at
that
time
being
hatched
under
cradle
blankets,
or
undergoing
regeneration
by
nursery
baptism
in
wash
hand
basins.
You
could
not
have
guessed
by
looking
at
any
one
of
them
that
the
Italian
ironed
double
frills
of
its
net
cap
surrounded
the
brows
of
a
preordained,
specially
sanctified
successor
of
St.
Paul,
St.
Peter,
or
St.
John;
nor
could
you
have
foreseen
in
the
folds
of
its
long
