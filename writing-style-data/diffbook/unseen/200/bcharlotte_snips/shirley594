nearer.
Let
me
alone,
Shirley.
Do
let
me
cry
a
few
minutes;
it
relieves
me."
Miss
Keeldar,
feeling
her
tremble
in
every
limb,
ceased
to
expostulate
with
her.
She
went
out
of
the
shed,
and
left
her
to
weep
in
peace.
It
was
the
best
plan.
In
a
few
minutes
Caroline
rejoined
her,
much
calmer.
She
said,
with
her
natural,
docile,
gentle
manner,
"Come,
Shirley,
we
will
go
home
now.
I
promise
not
to
try
to
see
Robert
again
till
he
asks
for
me.
I
never
will
try
to
push
myself
on
him.
I
thank
you
for
restraining
me
just
now."
"I
did
it
with
a
good
intention,"
returned
Miss
Keeldar.
"Now,
dear
Lina,"
she
continued,
"let
us
turn
our
faces
to
the
cool
morning
breeze,
and
walk
very
quietly
back
to
the
rectory.
We
will
steal
in
as
we
stole
out.
None
shall
know
where
we
have
been
or
what
we
have
seen
to
night;
neither
taunt
nor
misconstruction
can
consequently
molest
us.
To
morrow
we
will
see
Robert,
and
be
of
good
cheer;
but
I
will
say
no
more,
lest
I
should
begin
to
cry
too.
I
seem
hard
towards
you,
but
I
am
not
so."
