of
pearly
eggs
bedded
in
seaweed;
of
unscared
birds
covering
white
sands
in
happy
flocks."
"And
what
will
become
of
that
inexpressible
weight
you
said
you
had
on
your
mind?"
"I
will
try
to
forget
it
in
speculation
on
the
sway
of
the
whole
great

herd

whales

liquid
thunder

to
be
capsized
by
the

you
expect
to
see
mermaids,
Shirley?"
"One
of
them,
at
any
rate
I
do
not
bargain
for
