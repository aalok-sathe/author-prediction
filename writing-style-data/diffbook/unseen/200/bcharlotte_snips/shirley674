with
braid
for
the
Jew's
basket,
to
hasten
upstairs,
cover
her
curls
with
her
straw
bonnet,
and
throw
round
her
shoulders
the
black
silk
scarf,
whose
simple
drapery
suited
as
well
her
shape
as
its
dark
hue
set
off
the
purity
of
her
dress
and
the
fairness
of
her
face;
glad
was
she
to
escape
for
a
few
hours
the
solitude,
the
sadness,
the
nightmare
of
her
life;
glad
to
run
down
the
green
lane
sloping
to
the
Hollow,
to
scent
the
fragrance
of
hedge
flowers
sweeter
than
the
perfume
of
moss
rose
or
lily.
True,
she
knew
Robert
was
not
at
the
cottage;
but
it
was
delight
to
go
where
he
had
lately
been.
So
long,
so
totally
separated
from
him,
merely
to
see
his
home,
to
enter
the
room
where
he
had
that
morning
sat,
felt
like
a
reunion.
As
such
it
revived
her;
and
then
Illusion
was
again
following
her
in
Peri
mask.
The
soft
agitation
of
wings
caressed
her
cheek,
and
the
air,
breathing
from
the
blue
summer
sky,
bore
a
voice
which
whispered,
"Robert
may
come
home
while
you
are
in
his
house,
and
then,
at
least,
you
may
look
in
his
face
at
least
