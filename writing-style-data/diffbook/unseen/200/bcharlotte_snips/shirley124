vanished.
Hortense,
coming
in
ten
minutes
after,
found,
to
her
surprise,
that
Caroline
had
not
yet
commenced
her
exercise.
Mademoiselle
Moore
had
that
morning
a
somewhat
absent
minded
pupil.
Caroline
forgot,
again
and
again,
the
explanations
which
were
given
to
her.
However,
she
still
bore
with
unclouded
mood
the
chidings
her
inattention
brought
upon
her.
Sitting
in
the
sunshine
near
the
window,
she
seemed
to
receive
with
its
warmth
a
kind
influence,
which

girlish,
light,
and
pliant;
every
curve
was
neat,
every
limb
proportionate;
her
face
was
expressive
and
gentle;
her
eyes
were
handsome,
and
gifted
at
times
with
a
winning
beam
that
stole
into
the
heart,
with
a
language
that
spoke
softly
to
the
affections.
Her
mouth
was
very
pretty;
she
had
a
delicate
skin,
and
a
fine
flow
of
brown
hair,
which
she
knew
how
to
arrange
