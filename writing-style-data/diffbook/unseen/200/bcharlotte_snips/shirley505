followed
Miss
Ainley's
example
in
giving
her
time
and
her
industry
to
sew
for
the
children.
Not
only
is
the
churchyard
full,
but
the
rectory
garden
is
also
thronged.
Pairs
and
parties
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
are
seen
walking
amongst
the
waving
lilacs
and
laburnums.
The
house
also
is
occupied:
at
the
wide
open
parlour
windows
gay
groups
are
standing.
These
are
the
patrons
and
teachers,
who
are
to
swell
the
procession.
In
the
parson's
croft,
behind
the
rectory,
are
the
musicians
of
the
three
parish
bands,
with
their
instruments.
Fanny
and
Eliza,
in
the
smartest
of
caps
and
gowns,
and
the
whitest
of
aprons,
move
amongst
them,
serving
out
quarts
of
ale,
whereof
a
stock
was
brewed
very
sound
and
strong
some
weeks
since
by
the
rector's
orders,
and
under
his
special
superintendence.
Whatever
he
had
a
hand
in
must
be
managed
handsomely.
"Shabby
doings"
of
any
description
were
not
endured
under
his
sanction.
From
the
erection
of
a
public
building,
a
church,
school,
or
court
house,
to
the
cooking
of
a
dinner,
he
still
advocated
the
lordly,
liberal,
and
effective.
Miss
Keeldar
was
like
him
in
this
respect,
and
they
mutually
approved
each
other's
arrangements.
