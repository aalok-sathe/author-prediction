than

"Beautiful
morning,
Moore.
How
do,
my
boy?
Ha!
whom
have
we
here?"
(turning
to
the
personage
with
the
staff).
"Sugden!
What!
you're
going
to
work
directly?
On
my
word,
you
lose
no
time.
But
I
come
to
ask
explanations.
Your
message
was
delivered
to
me.
Are
you

the
desk.
His
master's
answer
to
the
rector's
question
was
a
smile.
Joe
took

Putting
on
a
quiet

look,
he
said,
"It's
a

Mr.
Helstone,
a

of."
"Indeed!
His
name,
Joe?
You

"Only

Moses
Barraclough;
