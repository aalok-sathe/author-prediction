sank
back
satisfied
and
bland
in
his
seat.
Moore,
chary
of
words,
replied
by
a
negative
movement
and
murmur.
"Yah'd
as
good,"
continued
his
visitor;
"it
'uld
set
ye
up
wald
a
sup
o'
this
stuff.
Uncommon
good
hollands.
Ye
get
it
fro'
furrin
parts,
I'se
think?"
"Ay!"
"Tak
my
advice
and
try
a
glass
on't.
Them
lads
'at's
coming
'll
keep
ye
talking,
nob'dy
knows
how
long.
Ye'll
need
propping."

back
o'

trot

hoofs

five
minutes
after,
heard
in
the
yard.
It
stopped,
and
a
well
known
nasal
voice
cried

"Boy"

addressing
Harry
Scott,
who
usually
hung
about
the
premises
from
9
a.m.

5

"take
my
horse
and
lead
him
into
the
stable."

erect,
