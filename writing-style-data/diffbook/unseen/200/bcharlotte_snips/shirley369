present
to
me
you
seem,
you
and
I
will
suit.
I
have
never
in
my
whole
life
been
able
to
talk
to
a
young
lady
as
I
have
talked
to
you
this
morning.
Kiss
me
and
good
bye."
Mrs.
Pryor
seemed
as
well
disposed
to
cultivate
Caroline's
acquaintance
as
Shirley.
She,
who
went
nowhere
else,
called
on
an
early
day
at
the
rectory.
She
came
in
the
afternoon,
when
the
rector
happened
to
be
out.
It
was
rather
a
close
day;
the
heat
of
the
weather
had
flushed
her,
and
she
seemed
fluttered
too
by
the
circumstance
of
entering
a
strange
house,
for
it
appeared
her
habits
were
most
retiring
and
secluded.
When
Miss
Helstone
went
to
her
in
the
dining
room
she
found
her
seated
on
the
sofa,
trembling,
fanning
herself
with
her
handkerchief,
and
seeming
to
contend
with
a
nervous
discomposure
that
threatened
to
become
hysterical.
Caroline
marvelled
somewhat
at
this
unusual
want
of
self
command
in
a
lady
of
her
years,
and
also
at
the
lack
of
real
strength
in
one
who
appeared
almost
robust
for
Mrs.
Pryor
hastened
to
allege
the
fatigue
of
her
walk,
the
heat
of
the
sun,
etc.,
as
reasons
for
her
temporary
