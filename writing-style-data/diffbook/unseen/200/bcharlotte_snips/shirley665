voyage
with
their
owner,
and
undergone
a
storm,
and
whose
pages
were
stained
with
salt
water;
some
mad
Methodist
Magazines,
full
of
miracles
and
apparitions,
of
preternatural
warnings,
ominous
dreams,
and
frenzied
fanaticism;
the
equally
mad
letters
of
Mrs.
Elizabeth
Rowe
from
the
Dead
to
the
Living;
a
few
old
English
classics.
From
these
faded
flowers
Caroline
had
in
her
childhood
extracted
the
honey;
they
were
tasteless
to
her
now.
By
way
of
change,
and
also
of
doing
good,
she
would
sew
make
garments
for
the
poor,
according
to
good
Miss
Ainley's
direction.
Sometimes,
as
she
felt
and
saw
her
tears
fall
slowly
on
her
work,
she
would
wonder
how
the
excellent
woman
who
had
cut
it
out
and
arranged
it
for
her
managed
to
be
so
equably
serene
in
her
solitude.
"I
never
find
Miss
Ainley
oppressed
with
despondency
or
lost
in
grief,"
she
thought;
"yet
her
cottage
is
a
still,
dim
little
place,
and
she
is
without
a
bright
hope
or
near
friend
in
the
world.
I
remember,
though,
she
told
me
once
she
had
tutored
her
thoughts
to
tend
upwards
to
heaven.
She
allowed
there
was,
and
ever
had
been,
little
enjoyment
in
this
world
for
her,
