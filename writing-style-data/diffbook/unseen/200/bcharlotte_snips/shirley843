being
could
do
a
man,
she
said,
that
was
both
gentle
and
brave,
strong
and
merciful
a
man
that
might
not
profess
to
be
pious,
but
she
knew
he
had
the
secret
of
religion
pure
and
undefiled
before
God.
The
spirit
of
love
and
peace
was
with
him.
He
visited
the
fatherless
and
widows
in
their
affliction,
and
kept
himself
unspotted
from
the
world.
Then
she
asked,
'Do
you
approve
what
I
have
done,
Harry?'
I
could
not

Mr.
Moore
allowed
his
pupil
a

to
contend
with
and
master

"When
I
had
signified
my
full
consent

of
her
will,
she
told
me
I
was
a
generous
boy,
and
she
was
proud
of
me.
'And
now,'
she
added,
'in
case
anything
should
happen,
you
will
know
what
to
say
to
Malice
when
she
comes
whispering
hard
things
in
your
ear,
insinuating
that
Shirley
has
wronged
you,
that
she
did
not
love
you.
You
will
know
that
I
did
love
you,
Harry;
that
no
sister
could
have
loved
you
better

own
treasure.'

Moore,
