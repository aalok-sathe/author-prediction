continued
Miss
Keeldar,
"I
never
yet
could
ascertain
properly
whether
you
are
a
Whig
or
a
Tory.
Pray,
which
party
has
the
honour
of
your
alliance?"
"It
is
rayther
difficult
to
explain
where
you
are
sure
not
to
be
understood,"
was
Joe's
haughty
response;
"but
as
to
being
a
Tory,
I'd
as
soon
be
an
old
woman,
or
a
young
one,
which
is
a
more
flimsier
article
still.
It
is
the
Tories
that
carries
on
the
war
and
ruins
trade;
and
if
I
be
of
any
party
though
political
parties
is
all
nonsense
I'm
of
that
which
is
most
favourable
to
peace,
and,
by
consequence,
to
the
mercantile
interests
of
this
here
land."
"So
am
I,
Joe,"
replied
Shirley,
who
had
rather
a
pleasure
in
teasing
the
overlooker,
by
persisting
in
talking
on
subjects
with
which
he
opined
she,
as
a
woman,
had
no
right
to
meddle
"partly,
at
least.
I
have
rather
a
leaning
to
the
agricultural
interest,
too;
as
good
reason
is,
seeing
that
I
don't
desire
England
to
be
under
the
feet
of
France,
and
that
if
a
share
of
my
income
comes
from
Hollow's
Mill,
a
larger
share
comes
from
the
landed
estate
around
it.
