try
the
first
expedient
will
lose
his
esteem
and
win
his
aversion;
if
she
has
sense,
she
will
be
her
own
governor,
and
resolve
to
subdue
and
bring
under
guidance
the
disturbed
realm
of
her
emotions.
She
will
determine
to
look
on
life
steadily,
as
it
is;
to
begin
to
learn
its
severe
truths
seriously,
and
to
study
its
knotty
problems
closely,
conscientiously.
It

had
a
little

the
difficulty
that
occurred
to

her
was,
"How

I
to
get
through
this
day?"
Last
night
she
had
hoped
it
would
be
spent
as
yesterday
was,
that
the
evening
would
be
again
passed
with
happiness
and
Robert.
She
had
learned
her
mistake
this
morning;
and
yet
she
could
not
settle
