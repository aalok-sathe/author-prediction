the
red
grate.
"Comfortable
quarters
you
have
here,
Mr.
Moore;
and
all
snug
to
yourself."
"Yes,
but
my
sister
would
be
glad
to
see
you,
if
you
would
prefer
stepping
into
the
house."
"Oh
no!
The
ladies
are
best
alone,
I
never
was
a
lady's
man.
You
don't
mistake
me
for
my
friend
Sweeting,
do
you,
Mr.
Moore?"
"Sweeting!
Which
of
them
is
that?
The
gentleman
in
the
chocolate
overcoat,
or
the
little
gentleman?"
"The
little
one

in
that

"But

with
one
besides,
for
when
I
and
Donne
urged
him
to
make
a
choice
amongst
the
fair
bevy,
he
named
which
do
you
think?"
With
a
queer,
quiet
smile
Mr.
Moore
replied,
"Dora,
of
course,
or
Harriet."
"Ha!
ha!
you've
an
excellent
guess.
But
what
made
you
hit
on
those
two?"
"Because
they
are
the
tallest,
the
handsomest,
and
Dora,
at
least,
is
the
stoutest;
and
as
your
friend
Mr.
Sweeting
is
but
a
little
slight
figure,
I
