O'
villains
like
Robin
a
Ree!"
But
what
has
been
said
in
the
last
page
or
two
is
not
germane
to
Caroline
Helstone's
feelings,
or
to
the
state
of
things
between
her
and
Robert
Moore.
Robert
had
done
her
no
wrong;
he
had
told
her
no
lie;
it
was
she
that
was
to
blame,
if
any
one
was.
What
bitterness
her
mind
distilled
should
and
would
be
poured
on
her
own
head.
She
had
loved
without
being
asked
to
love
a
natural,
sometimes
an
inevitable
chance,
but
big
with
misery.
Robert,
indeed,
had
sometimes
seemed
to
be
fond
of
her;
but
why?
Because
she
had
made
herself
so
pleasing
to
him,
he
could
not,
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts,
help
testifying
a
state
of
feeling
his
judgment
did
not
approve
nor
his
will
sanction.
He
was
about
to
withdraw
decidedly
from
intimate
communication
with
her,
because
he
did
not
choose
to
have
his
affections
inextricably
entangled,
nor
to
be
drawn,
despite
his
reason,
into
a
marriage
he
believed
imprudent.
Now,
what
was
she
to
do?
To
give
way
to
her
feelings,
or
to
vanquish
them?
To
pursue
him,
or
to
turn
upon
herself?
If
she
is
weak,
she
will
