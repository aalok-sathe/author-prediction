could
not
feel
firmer,
cooler,
more
equal
to
the
demands
of
the
occasion.
"You
are
aware,"
she
began
with
a
trembling
voice,
and
yet
the
most
conscientious
anxiety
to
avoid
exaggeration
in
what
she
was
about
to
say,
"that
a
body
of
rioters
has
attacked
Mr.
Moore's
mill
to
night.
We
heard
the
firing
and
confusion
very
plainly
here;
we
none
of
us
slept.
It
was
a
sad
night.
The
house
has
been
in
great
bustle
all
the
morning
with
people
coming
and
going.
The
servants
have
applied
to
me
for
orders
and
directions,
which
I
really
did
not
feel
warranted
in
giving.
Mr.
Moore
has,
I
believe,
sent
up
for
refreshments
for
the
soldiers
and
others
engaged
in
the
defence,
for
some
conveniences
also
for
the
wounded.
I
could
not
undertake
the
responsibility
of
giving
orders
or
taking
measures.
I
fear
delay
may
have
been
injurious
in
some
instances;
but
this
is
not
my
house.
You
were
absent,
my
dear
Miss
Keeldar.
What
could
I
do?"
"Were
no
refreshments
sent?"
asked
Shirley,
while
her
countenance,
hitherto
so
clear,
propitious,
and
quiet,
even
while
she
was
rating
the
milk
fetchers,
suddenly
turned
dark
and
warm.
"I
think
not,
my
dear."
