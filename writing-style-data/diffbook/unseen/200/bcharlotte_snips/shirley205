and
much
nearer
to
Caroline
than
her
deadened
spirit
suspected.
He
was
at
this
moment
crossing
the
churchyard,
approaching
the
rectory
garden
gate
not,
however,
coming
to
see
his
cousin,
but
intent
solely
on
communicating
a
brief
piece
of
intelligence
to
the
rector.
Yes,
Caroline;
you
hear
the
wire
of
the
bell
vibrate;
it
rings
again
for
the
fifth
time
this
afternoon.
You
start,
and
you
are
certain
now
that
this
must
be
he
of
whom
you
dream.
Why
you
are
so
certain
you
cannot
explain
to
yourself,
but
you
know
it.
You
lean
forward,
listening
eagerly
as
Fanny
opens
the
door.
Right!
That
is
the
voice
low,
with
the
slight
foreign
accent,
but
so
sweet,
as
you
fancy.
You
half
rise.
"Fanny
will
tell
him
Mr.
Helstone
is
with
company,
and
then
he
will
go
away."
Oh!
she
cannot
let
him
go.
In
spite
of
herself,
in
spite
of
her
reason,
she
walks
half
across
the
room;
she
stands
ready
to
dart
out
in
case
the
step
should
retreat;
but
he
enters
the
passage.
"Since
your
master
is
engaged,"
he
says,
"just
show
me
into
the
dining
room.
Bring
me
pen
and
ink.
I
will
write
a
short
note
