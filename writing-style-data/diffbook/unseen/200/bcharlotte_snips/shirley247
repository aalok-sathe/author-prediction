with
burning,
And
fuel,
and
fire!"
Here
followed
an
interval
of
clamorous
prayer,
accompanied
by
fearful
groans.
A
shout
of
"I've
found
liberty!"
"Doad
o'
Bill's
has
fun'
liberty!"
rang
from
the
chapel,
and
out
all
the
assembly
broke
again.
"What
a
mercy
is
this!
What
a
heaven
of
bliss!
How
unspeakably

With

full
heart
it

They
are
born
from
the
skies,
And
gives
glory
to
God
and
the
Lamb!"
The
stanza
which
followed
this,
after
another
and
longer
interregnum
of
shouts,
yells,
ejaculations,
frantic
cries,
agonized
groans,

climax
of
noise
