the
parlour
before
Miss
Keeldar.
He
glanced
at
Miss
Helstone;
he
could
scarcely
bring
himself
to
bend
to
her.
He
glared
on
both
the
ladies.
He
looked
as
if,
had
either
of
them
been
his
wife,
he
would
have
made
a
glorious
husband
at
the
moment.
In
each
hand
he
seemed
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
clutch
one
and
gripe
her
to
death.
However,
Shirley
took
pity.
She
ceased
to
laugh;
and
Caroline
was
too
true
a

and
his
attempts
being
well
received,
he
grew
presently
very
civil
and
quite
himself
again.
He
had
come,
indeed,
for
the
express
purpose
of
making
himself
charming
and
fascinating.
Rough
portents
had
met
him
on
his
first
admission
to
Fieldhead;
but
that
passage
got
over,
charming
and
fascinating
he
resolved
to
be.
Like
March,
having
come
