adorning
the
recess;
and
while
Shirley
was
stooping
to
examine
the
missal
and
the
rosary
on
the
inlaid
shelf,
and
while
the
Misses
Nunnely
indulged
in
a
prolonged
screech,
guiltless
of
expression,
pure
of
originality,
perfectly
conventional
and
absolutely
unmeaning,
Sir
Philip
stooped

was
prying,
he
might
have
found
that
in
Sir
Philip's
face
whereby
to
correct
his
inference.
Ever
shallow,
hasty,
and
positive,
he
went
home
quite
cock
a
hoop.
He
was
not
a
man
that
kept
secrets
well.
When
elate
on
a
subject,
he
could
not
avoid
talking
about
it.
The
next
morning,
having
occasion
to
employ
his
son's
tutor
as
his
secretary,

announce
to
him,
