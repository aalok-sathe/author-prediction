your
shadow
was
a
shape
with
a
white
forehead
and
dark
curls,
and
a
sparkling
necklace
round
its
neck.
But
I
only
just
got
a
glimpse
of
you
and
that
fairy
shadow;
I
did
not
wait
to
hear
you
converse."
"It
appears
you
walk
invisible.
I
noticed
a
ring

you;

only
stand

hedgerows
in
the
evening
after
the
mill
is
shut,
or
at
night
when
I
take
the
watchman's
place,
I
shall

every
little
bird
over
