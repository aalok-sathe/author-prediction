point.
He
had
observed
that
Miss
Keeldar
looked
pensive
and
delicate.
This
new
phase
in
her
demeanour
smote
him
on
his
weak
or
poetic
side.
A
spontaneous
sonnet
brewed
in
his
brain;
and
while
it
was
still
working
there,
one
of
his
sisters
persuaded
his
lady
love
to
sit
down
to
the
piano
and
sing
a
ballad
one
of
Sir
Philip's
own
ballads.

It
chanced
that
Shirley,
the
moment
before,
had
been
gazing
from
a
window

had
seen
that

of
the
domain
broad,
strong,
spreading
oaks,
and
high
towering
heroic
beeches
wrestling
with
the
gale.
Her
ear
had
caught
the
full
roar
of
the
forest
lower
down;
the
swift
rushing
of
clouds,
the
moon,
to
the
eye,
hasting
swifter
still,
had
crossed
her
vision.
She
turned
from
sight
and

if
not
rapt;
wakened,
if
not
inspired.
