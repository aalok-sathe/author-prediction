the
pole
o'
your
tent
amang
us,
Mr.
Moore,
we
lived
i'
peace
and
quietness
yea,
I
may
say,
in
all
loving
kindness.
I
am
not
myself
an
aged
person
as
yet,
but
I
can
remember
as
far
back
as
maybe
some
twenty
year,
when
hand
labour
were
encouraged
and
respected,
and
no
mischief
maker
had
ventured
to
introduce
these
here
machines
which
is
so
pernicious.
Now,
I'm
not
a
cloth
dresser
myself,
but
by
trade
a
tailor.
Howsiver,
my
heart
is
of
a
softish
nature.
I'm
a
very
feeling
man,
and
when
I
see
my
brethren
oppressed,
like
my
great
namesake
of
old,
I
stand
up
for
'em;
for
which
intent
I
this
day
speak
with
you
face
to
face,
and
advises
you
to
part
wi'
your
infernal
machinery,
and
tak
on
more
hands."
"What
if
I
don't
follow
your
advice,
Mr.
Barraclough?"
"The
Looard
pardon
you!
The
Looard
soften
your
heart,
sir!"
"Are
you
in
connection
with
the
Wesleyans
now,
Mr.
Barraclough?"
"Praise
God!
Bless
His
name!
I'm
a
joined
Methody!"
"Which
in
no
respect
prevents
you
from
being
at
the
same
time
a
drunkard
and
a
swindler.
I
saw
you
one
night
a
week
ago
laid
dead
