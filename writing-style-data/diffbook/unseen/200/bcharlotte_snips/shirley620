the
gallery,
looking
contrite,
ashamed,
sorry
as
any
repentant
child.
"How
is
Mrs.
Pryor?"
she
asked.
"Rather
out
of
spirits,"
said
Caroline.
"I
have
behaved
very
shamefully,
very
ungenerously,
very
ungratefully
to
her,"
said
Shirley.
"How
insolent
in
me
to
turn
on
her
thus
for
what,
after
all,
was
no
fault
only
an
excess
of
conscientiousness
on
her
part.
But
I
regret
my
error
most
sincerely.
Tell
her
so,
and
ask
if
she
will
forgive
me."
Caroline
discharged
the
errand
with
heartfelt
pleasure.
Mrs.
Pryor
rose,
came
to
the
door.
She
did
not
like
scenes;
she
dreaded
them
as
all
timid
people
do.
She
said
falteringly,
"Come
in,
my
dear."
Shirley
did
come
in
with
some
impetuosity.
She
threw
her
arms
round
her
governess,
and
while
she
kissed
her
heartily
she
said,
"You
know
you
must
forgive
me,
Mrs.
Pryor.
I
could
not
get
on
at
all
if
there
was
a
misunderstanding
between
you
and
me."
"I
have
nothing
to
forgive,"
was
the
reply.
"We
will
pass
it
over
now,
if
you
please.
The
final
result
of
the
incident
is
that
it
proves
more
plainly
than
ever
how
unequal
I
am
to
certain
crises."
And
that
was
the
painful
feeling
