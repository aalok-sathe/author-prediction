they
show
the
becoming,
decent
self
government
of
our
admirable
rectors.
I
watch
Moore
sometimes,
to
try
and
discover
how
he
can
be
pleased;
but
he
has
not
that
child's
simplicity
about
him.
Did
you
ever
find
out
his
accessible
point,
Caroline?
you
have
seen
more
of
him
than
I."
"It
is
not,
at
any
rate,
that
of
my
uncle
and
Dr.
Boultby,"
returned
Caroline,
smiling.
She
always
felt
a
sort
of
shy
pleasure
in
following
Miss
Keeldar's
lead
respecting
the
discussion
of
her
cousin's
character.
Left
to
herself,
she
would
never
have
touched
on
the
subject;
but
when
invited,
the
temptation
of
talking
about
him
of
whom
she
was
ever
thinking
was
irresistible.

she
added,

really
don't
know
what
it
is,
for
I
never
watched
Robert
in
my
life
but
my
scrutiny
was
presently
baffled
by
finding
he
was
watching
me."
"There
it
is!"
exclaimed
Shirley.
"You
can't
fix
your
eyes
on
him
but
his
presently
flash
on
you.
He
is
never
off
his
guard.
He
won't
give
you
an
advantage.
Even
when
he
does
not
look
at
you,
his
thoughts
seem
to
be
busy
amongst
your
own
thoughts,
tracing
your
words
and
actions
to
their
source,
