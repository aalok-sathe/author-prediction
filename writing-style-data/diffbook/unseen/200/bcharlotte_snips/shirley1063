a
wild
cry
for
sal
volatile
and
burnt
feathers.
"Impossible!"
would
be
pronounced
here;
"untrue!"
would
be
responded
there;
"inartistic!"
would
be
solemnly
decided.
Note
well.
Whenever
you
present
the
actual,
simple
truth,
it
is,
somehow,
always
denounced
as
a
lie
they
disown
it,
cast
it
off,
throw
it
on
the
parish;
whereas
the
product
of
your
own
imagination,
the
mere
figment,
the
sheer
fiction,
is
adopted,
petted,
termed
pretty,
proper,
sweetly
natural
the
little,
spurious
wretch
gets
all
the
comfits,
the
honest,
lawful
bantling
all
the
cuffs.
Such
is
the
way
of
the
world,
Peter;
and
as
you
are
the
legitimate
urchin,
rude,
unwashed,
and
naughty,
you
must
stand
down.
Make
way
for
Mr.
Sweeting.
Here
he
comes,
with
his
lady
on
his
arm
the
most
splendid
and
the
weightiest
woman
in
Yorkshire
Mrs.
Sweeting,
formerly
Miss
Dora
Sykes.
They
were
married
under
the
happiest
auspices,
Mr.
Sweeting
having
been
just
inducted
to
a
comfortable
living,
and
Mr.
Sykes
being
in
circumstances
to
give
Dora
a
handsome
portion.
They
lived
long
and
happily
together,
beloved
by
their
parishioners
and
by
a
numerous
circle
of
friends.
There!
I
think
the
varnish
has
been
put
on
very
nicely.
Advance,
Mr.
Donne.
