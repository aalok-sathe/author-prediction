which
was
a
distinct
thing
from
this
social
benevolence
depending,
indeed,
on
quite
a
different
part
of
her
character.
Miss
Helstone
was
the
choice
of
her
affection
and
intellect;
the
Misses
Pearson,
Sykes,
Wynne,
etc.,
etc.,
only
the
profiteers
by
her
good
nature
and
vivacity.
Donne
happened
to
come
into
the
drawing
room
while
Shirley,
sitting
on
the
sofa,
formed
the
centre
of
a
tolerably
wide
circle.
She
had
already
forgotten
her
exasperation
against
him,
and
she
bowed
and
smiled
good
humouredly.
The
disposition
of
the
man
was
then
seen.
He
knew
neither
how
to
decline
the
advance
with
dignity,
as
one
whose
just
pride
has
been
wounded,
nor
how
to
meet
it
with
frankness,
as
one
who
is
glad
to
forget
and
forgive.
His
punishment
had
impressed
him
with
no
sense
of
shame,
and
he
did
not
experience
that
feeling
on
encountering
his
chastiser.
He
was
not
vigorous
enough
in
evil
to
be
actively
malignant
he
merely
passed
by
sheepishly
with
a
rated,
scowling
look.
Nothing
could
ever
again
reconcile
him
to
his
enemy;
while
no
passion
of
resentment,
for
even
sharper
and
more
ignominious
inflictions,
could
his
lymphatic
nature
know.
"He
was
not
worth
a
scene!"
said
Shirley
