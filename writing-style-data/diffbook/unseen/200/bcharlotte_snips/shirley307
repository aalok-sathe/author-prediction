at
the
door
startled
her,
and
undid
her
day's
work.
She
was
scarcely
pleased,
therefore,
to
see
Miss
Helstone.
She
received
her
with
reserve,
bade
her
be
seated
with
austerity,
and
when
she
got
her
placed
opposite,
she
fixed
her
with
her
eye.
This
was
no
ordinary
doom
to
be
fixed
with
Miss
Mann's
eye.
Robert
Moore
had
undergone
it
once,
and
had
never
forgotten
the
circumstance.
He
considered
it
quite
equal

where
he
had
appeared
in
Caroline's
presence
with
a
very
queer
face,
and
amazed
her
by
demanding
a
cousinly
salute
on
the
spot,
to
rectify
a
damage
that
had
been
done
him.
Certainly
Miss
Mann
had
a
formidable
eye
for
one
of
the
softer
sex.
It
was
prominent,
and
showed
a
great
deal
of
the
white,
and
looked
as
steadily,
as
unwinkingly,
at
you
