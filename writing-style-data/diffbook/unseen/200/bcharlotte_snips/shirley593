Accordingly
Mr.
Moore
and
Mr.
Helstone
went
round
the
yard,
examining
each
prostrate
form.
They
then
gave
directions
to
have
the
wounded
taken
up
and
carried
into
the
mill.
This
duty
being
performed,
Joe
Scott
was
ordered
to
saddle
his
master's
horse
and

triumph.
Is
this
a
time
are
these
causes
for
weeping?"
"You
do
not
know
what
I
have
in
my
heart,"
pleaded
the
other
"what
pain,
what
distraction
nor
whence
it
arises.
I
can
understand
that
you
should
exult

Robert's
greatness
and
goodness;
