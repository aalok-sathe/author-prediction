Samuel
called
of
God
from
his
birth.
He
was
to
be
a
clergyman.
Mr.
and
the
Misses
Sympson,
not
understanding
the
youth,
let
him
much
alone.
Shirley
made
him
her
pet,
and
he
made
Shirley
his
playmate.
In
the
midst
of
this
family
circle,
or
rather
outside
it,
moved
the
tutor
the
satellite.
Yes,
Louis
Moore
was
a
satellite
of
the
house
of
Sympson
connected,
yet
apart;
ever
attendant,
ever
distant.
Each
member
of
that
correct
family
treated
him
with
proper
dignity.
The
father
was
austerely
civil,
sometimes
irritable;
the
mother,
being
a
kind
woman,
was
attentive,
but
formal;
the
daughters
saw
in
him
an
abstraction,
not
a
man.
It
seemed,
by
their
manner,
that
their
brother's
tutor
did
not
live
for
them.
They
were
learned;
so
was
he
but
not
for
them.
They
were
accomplished;
he
had
talents
too,
imperceptible
to
their
senses.
The
most
spirited
sketch
from
his
fingers
was
a
blank
to
their
eyes;
the
most
original
observation
from
his
lips
fell
unheard
on
their
ears.
Nothing
could
exceed
the
propriety
of
their
behaviour.
I
should
have
said
nothing
could
have
equalled
it;
but
I
remember
a
fact
which
strangely
astonished
Caroline
Helstone.
It
was
to
discover
