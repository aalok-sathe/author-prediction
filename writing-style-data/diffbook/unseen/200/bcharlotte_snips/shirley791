consulting
the
mirror,
it
reflected
an
unanimous
vote
against
her.
"You
must
go,"
said
Mr.
Hall,
"and
behave
courteously
too.
You
owe
many
duties
to
society.
It
is
not
permitted
you
to
please
only
yourself."
Louis
Moore
assented
with
a
low
"Hear,
hear!"
Caroline,
approaching
her,
smoothed
her
wavy
curls,
gave
to
her
attire
a
less
artistic
and
more
domestic
grace,
and
Shirley
was
put
out
of
the
room,
protesting
still,
by
a
pouting
lip,
against
her
dismissal.
"There
is
a
curious
charm
about
her,"
observed
Mr.
Hall,
when
she
was
gone.
"And
now,"
he
added,
"I
must
away;
for
Sweeting
is
off
to
see
his
mother,
and
there
are
two
funerals."
"Henry,
get
your
books;
it
is
lesson
time,"
said
Moore,
sitting
down
to
his
desk.
"A
curious
charm!"
repeated
the
pupil,
when
he
and
his
master
were
left
alone.
"True.
Is
she
not
a
kind
of
white
witch?"
he
asked.
"Of
whom
are
you
speaking,
sir?"
"Of
my
cousin
Shirley."
"No
irrelevant
questions;
study
in
silence."
Mr.
Moore
looked
and
spoke
sternly
sourly.
Henry
knew
this
mood.
It
was
a
rare
one
with
his
tutor;
but
when
it
came
he
had
an
awe
of
it.
He
obeyed.
