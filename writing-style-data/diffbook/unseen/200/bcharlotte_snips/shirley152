thus
began
to
read.
The
very
first
scene
in
"Coriolanus"
came
with
smart
relish
to
his
intellectual
palate,
and
still
as
he
read
he
warmed.
He
delivered
the
haughty
speech
of
Caius
Marcius
to
the
starving
citizens
with
unction;
he
did
not
say
he
thought
his
irrational
pride
right,
but
he
seemed
to
feel
it
so.
Caroline
looked
up
at
him
with
a
singular
smile.
"There's

already,"
she
said.
"You

delighted
in.
As
he
advanced,
he
forgot
to
criticise;
it
was
evident
he
appreciated
the
power,
the
truth
of
each
portion;
and,
stepping
out
of
the
narrow
line
of
private
prejudices,
began
to
revel
in
the
large
picture
of
human
nature,
to
feel
the
reality
stamped
upon
the
characters
who
were
speaking
from
that
page
before
him.
He
did
not
read
the
comic
scenes

and
Caroline,
