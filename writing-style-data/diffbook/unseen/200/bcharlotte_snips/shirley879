I
could
not
help
liking
that
Shirley.
Take
from
her
her
education;
take
her
ornaments,
her
sumptuous
dress,
all
extrinsic
advantages;
take
all
grace,
but
such
as
the
symmetry
of
her
form
renders
inevitable;
present
her
to
me
at
a
cottage
door,
in
a
stuff
gown;
let
her
offer
me
there
a
draught
of
water,
with
that
smile,
with
that
warm
good
will
with
which
she
now
dispenses
manorial
hospitality
I
should
like
her.
I
should
wish
to
stay
an
hour;
I
should
linger
to
talk
with
that
rustic.
I
should
not
feel
as
I
now
do;
I
should
find
in
her
nothing
divine;
but
whenever
I
met
the
young
peasant,
it
would
be
with
pleasure;
whenever
I
left
her,
it
would
be
with
regret.
"How
culpably
careless
in
her
to
leave
her
desk
open,
where
I
know
she
has
money!
In
the
lock
hang
the
keys
of
all
her
repositories,
of
her
very
jewel
casket.
There
is
a
purse
in
that
little
satin
bag;
I
see
the
tassel
of
silver
beads
hanging
out.
That
spectacle
would
provoke
my
brother
Robert.
All
her
little
failings
would,
I
know,
be
a
source
of
irritation
to
him.
If
they
vex
me
it
