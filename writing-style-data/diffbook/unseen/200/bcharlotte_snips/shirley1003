had
lit
a
good
fire
in
the
parlour;
she
was
preparing
tea
in
the
kitchen.
"Hortense,"
said
Moore,
as
his
sister
bustled
up
to
help
him
off
with
his
cloak,
"I
am
pleased
to
come
home."
Hortense
did
not
feel
the
peculiar
novelty
of
this
expression
coming
from
her
brother,
who
had
never
before
called
the
cottage
his
home,
and
to
whom
its
narrow

in
your
absence."
"Sister,
I
think
on
this
first
day
of
your
return
home
you
ought
to
have
a
friend
or
so
to
tea,
if
it
were
only
to
see
how
fresh
and
spruce
you
have
made
the
little
place."
"True,
brother.
If
it
were
not
late
I
might
send
for
Miss
Mann."
"So
you
might;
but
it
really
is
too
late
to
disturb
that
