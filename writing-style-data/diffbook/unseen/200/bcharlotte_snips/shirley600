men
more
truly
than
men
read
women.
I'll
prove
that
in
a
magazine
paper
some
day
when
I've
time;
only
it
will
never
be
inserted.
It
will
be
'declined
with
thanks,'
and
left
for
me
at
the
publisher's."
"To
be
sure.
You
could
not
write
cleverly
enough.
You
don't
know
enough.
You
are
not
learned,
Shirley."
"God
knows
I
can't
contradict
you,
Cary;
I'm
as
ignorant
as
a
stone.
There's
one
comfort,
however:
you
are
not
much
better."
They
descended
to
breakfast.
"I
wonder
how
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Hortense
Moore
have
passed
the
night,"
said
Caroline,
as
she
made
the
coffee.
"Selfish
being
that
I
am,
I
never
thought
of
either
of
them
till
just
now.
They
will
have
heard
all
the
tumult,
Fieldhead
and
the
cottage
are
so
near;
and
Hortense
is
timid
in
such
matters
so,
no
doubt,
is
Mrs.
Pryor."
"Take
my
word
for
it,
Lina,
Moore
will
have
contrived
to
get
his
sister
out
of
the
way.
She
went
home
with
Miss
Mann.
He
will
have
quartered
her
there
for
the
night.
As
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
I
own
I
am
uneasy
about
her;
but
in
another
half
hour
we
will
be
with
her."
By
this
time
