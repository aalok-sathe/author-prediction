"'Exactly.
You
have
a
habit
of
calling
yourself
plain.
You
are
sensitive
about
the
cut
of
your
features
because
they
are
not
quite
on
an
Apollo
pattern.
You
abase
them
more
than
is
needful,
in
the
faint
hope
that
others
may
say
a
word
in
their
behalf
which
won't
happen.
Your
face
is
nothing
to
boast
of,
certainly
not
a
pretty
line
nor
a
pretty
tint
to
be
found
therein.'

"'It
looks
like
a
god
of
Egypt
a
great
sand
buried
stone
head;
or
rather
I
will

it
to
nothing
so

It
looks

are
my
mastiff's
cousin.
I
think
you
as
much
like
him
as
a
man
can
be
like
a
dog.'
"'Tartar
is
your
dear
companion.
In
summer,
when
you
rise
early,
and
run
out
into
the
fields
to
wet
your
feet
with
the
dew,
and
freshen
your
cheek
and
uncurl
your
hair
with
the
breeze,
you
always
call
him
to
follow
you.
You
call
him
sometimes
with
a
whistle
that
you
learned
from
me.
In
the
solitude
of
your
wood,
when
you
think
nobody
but
Tartar
is
listening,
you
whistle
the
very
tunes
you
imitated
from
my
lips,
