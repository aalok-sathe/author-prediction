their
disgrace,
not
his.
Mr.
Moore
himself
hates
nobody.
He
only
wants
to
do
his
duty,
and
maintain
his
rights.
You
are
wrong
to
talk
so."
"I
talk
as
I
think.
He
has
a
cold,
unfeeling
heart,
yond'
Moore."
"But,"
interposed
Shirley,
"supposing
Moore
was
driven
from
the
country,
and
his
mill
razed
to
the
ground,
would
people
have
more
work?"
"They'd
have
less.
I
know
that,
and
they
know
that;
and
there
is
many
an
honest
lad
driven
desperate
by
the
certainty
that
whichever
way
he
turns
he
cannot
better
himself;
and
there
is
dishonest
men
plenty
to
guide
them
to
the
devil,
scoundrels
that
reckons
to
be
the
'people's
friends,'
and
that
knows
nought
about
the
people,
and
is
as
insincere
as
Lucifer.
I've
lived
aboon
forty
year
in
the
world,
and
I
believe
that
'the
people'
will
never
have
any
true
friends
but
theirseln
and
them
two
or
three
good
folk
i'
different
stations
that
is
friends
to
all
the
world.
Human
natur',
taking
it
i'
th'
lump,
is
nought
but
selfishness.
It
is
but
excessive
few,
it
is
but
just
an
exception
here
and
there,
now
and
then,
sich
as
ye
two
young
uns
and
me,
