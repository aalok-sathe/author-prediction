"Not
at
all.
You
are
almost
as
good
a
poet
as
he."
"Madam,
you
are
wandering
from
the
point."
"Indeed,
uncle,
I
wanted
to
do
so,
and
I
shall
be
glad
to
lead
you
away
with
me.
Do
not
let
us
get
out
of
temper
with
each
other;
it
is
not
worth
while."
"Out
of
temper,
Miss
Keeldar!
I
should
be
glad
to
know
who
is
out
of
temper."
"I
am
not,
yet."
"If
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
I
am,
I
consider
that
you
are
guilty
of
impertinence."
"You
will
be
soon,
if
you
go
on
at
that
rate."
"There
it
is!
With
your
pert
tongue
you
would
try
the
patience
of
a
Job."
"I
know
I
should."
"No
levity,
miss!
This
is
not
a
laughing
matter.
It
is
an
affair
I
am
resolved
to
probe
thoroughly,
convinced
that
there
is
mischief
at
the
bottom.
You
described
just
now,
with
far
too
much
freedom
for
your
years
and
sex,
the
sort
of
individual
you
would
prefer
as
a
husband.
Pray,
did
you
paint
from
the
life?"
Shirley
opened
her
lips,
but
instead
of
speaking
she
only
glowed
rose
red.
"I
shall
have
an
answer
to
that
question,"
affirmed
Mr.
