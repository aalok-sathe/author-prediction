In

absence
she
sat
or
wandered
alone,
spoke
little,
and
ate

She
furthered
no
preparations
for
her
nuptials;
Louis
was
himself
obliged
to
direct
all
arrangements.
He
was
virtually
master
of
Fieldhead
weeks
before
he
became
so
nominally
the
least
presumptuous,
the
kindest
master
that

a

The

It

that
Miss
