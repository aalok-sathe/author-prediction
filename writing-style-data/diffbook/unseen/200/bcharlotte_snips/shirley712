the
bedside,
one
hand
placed
in
the
other,
gently
rocking
herself
to
and
fro,
in
an
attitude
and
with
a
movement
habitual
to
her.
At
last
she
said,
"I
have
sent
Fanny
to
Fieldhead
to
fetch
a
few
things
for
me,
such
as
I
shall
want
during
a
short
stay
here.
It
is
my
wish
to
remain
with
you
till
you
are
better.
Your
uncle
kindly
permits
my
attendance.
Will
it
to
yourself
be
acceptable,
Caroline?"
"I
am
sorry
you
should
take
such
needless
trouble.
I
do
not
feel
very
ill,
but
I
cannot
refuse
resolutely.
It
will
be
such
comfort
to
know
you
are
in
the
house,
to
see
you
sometimes
in
the
room;
but
don't
confine
yourself
on
my
account,
dear
Mrs.
Pryor.
Fanny
nurses
me
very
well."
Mrs.
Pryor,
bending
over
the
pale
little
sufferer,
was
now
smoothing
the
hair
under
her
cap,
and
gently
raising
her
pillow.
As
she
performed
these
offices,
Caroline,
smiling,
lifted
her
face
to
kiss
her.
"Are
you
free
from
pain?
Are
you
tolerably
at
ease?"
was
inquired
in
a
low,
earnest
voice,
as
the
self
elected
nurse
yielded
to
the
caress.
"I
think
I
am
almost
happy."
"You
wish
to
drink?
