but
also
nothing
could
be
more
vigilant,
assiduous,
untiring.
I
have
intimated
that
she
was
a
peculiar
personage,
and
in
nothing
was
her
peculiarity
more
shown
than
in
the
nature
of
the
interest
she
evinced
for
Caroline.
She
watched
all
her
movements;
she

post;
but
she
soon
found
that
it
needed
but
to
know
both
ladies
to
comprehend
fully
the
enigma.
Every
one,
it
seemed
to
her,
must
like,
must
love,
must
prize

they
knew

No
matter

she
perseveringly
