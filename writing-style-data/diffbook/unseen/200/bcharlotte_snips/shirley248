gaped
to
take
us
in;
Mercy
to
our
rescue
flew,
Broke
the
snare,
and
brought
us
through.
"Here,
as
in
a
lion's
den,
Undevoured
we
still
remain,
Pass
secure
the
watery
flood,
Hanging
on
the
arm
of
God.
"Here
"
(Terrible,
most
distracting
to
the
ear,
was
the
strained
shout
in
which
the
last
stanza
was
given.)
"Here
we
raise
our
voices
higher,
Shout
in
the
refiner's
fire,
Clap
our
hands
amidst
the
flame,
Glory
give
to
Jesus'
name!"
The
roof
of
the
chapel
did
not
fly
off,
which
speaks
volumes
in
praise

its
solid

But
if
Briar
Chapel
seemed
alive,
so
also
did
Briarmains,
though
certainly
the
mansion
appeared
to
enjoy
a
quieter
phase
of
existence
than
the
temple.
Some
of
its
windows
too
were
aglow;
the
lower
casements
opened
upon
the
lawn;
curtains
concealed
the
interior,
and
partly
obscured
the
ray
of
the
candles
which
lit
it,
but
they
did
not
entirely
muffle
the
sound
of
voice
and
laughter.
We
are
privileged
to
enter
that
front
door,
and
to
penetrate
to
the
domestic
sanctum.
It
is
not
the
presence
of
company
which
makes
Mr.
Yorke's
habitation
lively,
for
there
is
none
within
it
save
his
own
