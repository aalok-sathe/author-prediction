the
rescue
party
set
out.
Cheerfulness,
it
would
appear,
is
a
matter
which
depends
fully
as
much
on
the
state
of
things
within
as
on
the
state
of
things
without
and
around
us.
I
make
this
trite
remark,
because
I
happen
to
know
that
Messrs.
Helstone
and
Moore
trotted
forth
from
the
mill
yard
gates,
at
the
head
of
their
very
small
company,
in
the
best
possible
spirits.
When
a
ray
from
a
lantern
(the
three
pedestrians
of
the
party
carried
each
one)
fell
on
Mr.
Moore's
face,
you
could
see
an
unusual,
because
a
lively,
spark
dancing
in
his
eyes,
and
a
new
found
vivacity
mantling
on
his
dark
physiognomy;
and
when
the
rector's
visage
was
illuminated,
his
hard
features
were
revealed
all
agrin
and
ashine
with
glee.
Yet
a
drizzling
night,
a
somewhat
perilous
expedition,
you
would
think
were
not
circumstances
calculated
to
enliven
those
exposed
to
the
wet
and
engaged
in
the
adventure.
If
any
member
or
members
of
the
crew
who
had
been
at
work
on
Stilbro'
Moor
had
caught
a
view
of
this
party,
they
would
have
had
great
pleasure
in
shooting
either
of
the
leaders
from
behind
a
wall:
and
the
leaders
knew
this;
