was
a
bad
and
frivolous
one
at
the
best,
and
most
of
the
works
it
boasted
were
bad
and
frivolous,
highly
injurious
in
their
tendency
to
weak

minds.
He
wondered
(he
remarked
parenthetically)
what
noodle
first
made
it
the
fashion
to
teach
women
French.
Nothing
was
more
improper
for
them.
It
was
like
feeding
a
rickety
child
on
chalk
and
water
gruel.
Caroline
must
give
it
up,
and
give
up
her
cousins

dangerous
people.
Mr.
Helstone
quite
expected
opposition
to
this
order;
he
expected
tears.
Seldom
did
he
trouble
himself
about
Caroline's
movements,

Hollow's
Cottage;

Moore's
occasional
presence
at
the
rectory.

to
make
himself
sociable
and

by
pinching
the
ears
of
an
aged
black
cat,
which
usually
shared
with
Miss
Helstone's
feet
the
accommodation
of
her
footstool,
or
by
borrowing
a
fowling
piece,
and
banging
away
at
a
tool
shed
door
in
the
garden
while
enough
of
daylight
remained
to
show
that
conspicuous
mark,
keeping
the
passage
and
sitting
room
doors
