"C'est
presque
le
Francais
rattrape,
n'est
ce
pas?"
"You
could
not
write
French
as
you
once
could,
I
dare
say?"
"Oh
no!
I
should
make
strange
work
of
my
concords
now."
"You
could
not
compose
the
devoir
of
'La
Premiere
Femme
Savante'?"
"Do
you
still
remember
that
rubbish?"
"Every
line."
"I
doubt
you."
"I
will
engage
to
repeat
it
word
for
word."
"You
would
stop
short
at
the
first
line."
"Challenge
me
to
the

challenge
you."

proceeded
to
recite
the
following.

gave
it

some
readers.
"And
it
came
to
pass,
when
men
began
to
multiply
on
the
face
of
the
earth,
and
daughters
were
born
unto
them,
that
the
sons
of
God
saw
the
daughters
of
men
that
they
were
fair;
and
they
took
them
wives
of
all
which
they
chose."
This
was
in
the
dawn
of
time,
before
the
morning
stars
were
set,
and
while
they
yet
sang
together.
The
epoch
is
so
remote,
the
mists
and
dewy
gray
of
matin
twilight
veil
it
with
so
vague
an
obscurity,
that
all
distinct
feature
of
custom,
all
clear
line
of
locality,
evade
perception
