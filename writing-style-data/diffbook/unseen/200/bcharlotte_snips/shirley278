whom
I
hope
to
transport
a
fellow
who
preaches
at
the
chapel
yonder
sometimes."
"Not
Moses
Barraclough?"
"Yes."
"Ah!
you've
arrested
him?
Good!
Then
out
of
a
scoundrel
you're
going
to
make
a
martyr.
You've
done
a
wise
thing."
"I've
done
a
right
thing.
Well,
the
short
and
the
long
of
it
is,
I'm
determined
to
get
Farren
a
place,
and
I
reckon
on
you
to
give
him
one."
"This
is
cool,
however!"
exclaimed
Mr.
Yorke.
"What
right
have
you
to
reckon
on
me
to
provide
for
your
dismissed
workmen?
What
do
I
know
about
your
Farrens
and
your
Williams?
I've
heard
he's
an
honest
man,
but
am
I
to
support
all
the
honest
men
in
Yorkshire?
You
may
say
that
would
be
no
great
charge
to
undertake;
but
great
or
little,
I'll
none
of
it."
"Come,
Mr.
Yorke,
what
can
you
find
for
him
to
do?"
"I
find!
You'll
make
me
use
language
I'm
not
accustomed
to
use.
I
wish
you
would
go
home.
Here
is
the
door;
set
off."
Moore
sat
down
on
one
of
the
hall
chairs.
"You
can't
give
him
work
in
your
mill
good;
but
you
have
land.
Find
him
some
occupation
on
your
land,
