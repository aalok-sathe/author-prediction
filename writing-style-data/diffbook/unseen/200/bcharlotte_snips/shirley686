the
labour
of
persuading
the
stubborn,
the
constant
burden
and
task
of
training
the
best."
"But
with
love
it
need
not
be
so
very
difficult,"
interposed
Caroline.
"Mothers
love
their
children
most
dearly
almost
better
than
they
love
themselves."
"Fine
talk!
very
sentimental!
There
is
the
rough,
practical
part
of
life
yet
to
come
for
you,
young
miss."
"But,
Mrs.
Yorke,
if
I
take
a
little
baby
into
my
arms
any
poor
woman's
infant,
for
instance
I
feel
that
I
love
that
helpless
thing
quite
peculiarly,
though
I
am
not
its
mother.
I
could
do
almost
anything
for
it
willingly,
if
it
were
delivered
over
entirely
to
my
care
if
it
were
quite
dependent
on
me."
"You
feel!
Yes,
yes!
I
dare
say,
now.
You
are
led
a
great
deal
by
your
feelings,
and
you
think
yourself
a
very
sensitive
personage,
no
doubt.
Are
you
aware
that,
with
all
these
romantic
ideas,
you
have
managed
to
train
your
features
into
an
habitually
lackadaisical
expression,
better
suited
to
a
novel
heroine
than
to
a
woman
who
is
to
make
her
way
in
the
real
world
by
dint
of
common
sense?"
"No;
I
am
not
at
all
aware
of
that,
Mrs.
Yorke."
