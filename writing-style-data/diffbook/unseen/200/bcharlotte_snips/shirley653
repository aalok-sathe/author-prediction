way
of
character,
cash,
and
cleanliness,
to
gain.
These
persons
Moore
hunted
like
any
sleuth
hound,
and
well
he
liked
the
occupation.
Its
excitement
was
of
a
kind
pleasant
to
his
nature.
He
liked
it
better
than
making
cloth.
His
horse
must
have
hated
these
times,
for
it
was
ridden
both
hard
and
often.
He
almost
lived
on
the
road,
and
the
fresh
air
was
as
welcome
to
his
lungs
as
the
policeman's
quest
to
his
mood;
he
preferred
it
to
the
steam
of
dye
houses.
The
magistrates
of
the
district
must
have
dreaded
him.
They
were
slow,
timid
men;
he
liked
both
to
frighten
and
to
rouse
them.
He
liked
to
force
them
to
betray
a
certain
fear,
which
made
them
alike
falter
in
resolve
and
recoil
in
action
the
fear,
simply,
of
assassination.
This,
indeed,
was
the
dread
which
had
hitherto
hampered
every
manufacturer
and
almost
every
public
man
in
the
district.
Helstone
alone
had
ever
repelled
it.
The
old
Cossack
knew
well
he
might
be
shot.
He
knew
there
was
risk;
but
such
death
had
for
his
nerves
no
terrors.
It
would
have
been
his
chosen,
might
he
have
had
a
choice.
Moore
likewise
knew
his
danger.
