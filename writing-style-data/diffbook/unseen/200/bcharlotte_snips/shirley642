"I
remember
I
sighed
as
Miss
Hardman
quitted
my
bedside.
She
caught
the
sound,
and
turning,
said
severely,
'I
fear,
Miss
Grey,
you
have
inherited
in
fullest
measure
the
worst
sin
of
our
fallen
nature
the
sin
of
pride.
You
are
proud,
and
therefore
you
are
ungrateful
too.
Mamma
pays

she
addressed
me
thus;
still,
I
fear
she
was
selfish,
my
dear.
I
would
never
wish
to
speak
ill
of
my
superiors
in
rank,
but
I
think
she
was
a
little
selfish."
"I
remember,"

Mrs.
Pryor,
after
a
pause,
"another
