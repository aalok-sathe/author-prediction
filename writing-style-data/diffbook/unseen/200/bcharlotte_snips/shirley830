soon

away.
Attention,
Henry!
Miss
Keeldar
consents
to
favour
you.
'Voyez
ce
cheval
ardent
et
impetueux,'
so
it
commences."
Miss
Keeldar
did
consent
to
make
the
effort;
but
she
soon
stopped.
"Unless
I
heard
the
whole
repeated
I
cannot
continue
it,"
she
said.
"Yet
it
was
quickly
learned
'soon
gained,
soon
gone,'"
moralized
the
tutor.
He
recited
the
passage
deliberately,
accurately,
with
slow,
impressive
emphasis.
Shirley,
by
degrees,
inclined
her
ear
as
he
went
on.
Her

returned
towards

When
he
ceased,
she

the
periods
as
he
had
delivered

she
reproduced
his
manner,
his
pronunciation,
his
expression.
It
was
now
her
turn
to
petition.
"Recall
'Le
Songe
d'Athalie,'"
she
entreated,
"and
say
it."
He
said
it
for
her.
She
took
it
from
him;
she
found
lively
excitement
in
the
pleasure
of
making
his
language
her
own.
She
asked
for
further
indulgence;
all
the
old
school
pieces
were
revived,
and
with
them
Shirley's
old
school
days.
He
had
gone
through
some
of
the
best
passages
of
Racine
and
Corneille,
and
then
