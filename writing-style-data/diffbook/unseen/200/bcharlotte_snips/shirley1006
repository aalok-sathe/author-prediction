No
longer
crushed,
and
saddened,
and
slow,
and
drooping,
she
looked
like
one
who
had
tasted
the
cordial
of
heart's
ease,
and
been
lifted
on
the
wing
of
hope.
After
tea
Hortense
went
upstairs.
She
had
not
rummaged
her
drawers
for
a
month
past,
and
the
impulse
to
perform
that
operation
was
now
become
resistless.
During
her
absence
the
talk
passed
into
Caroline's
hands.
She
took
it
up
with
ease;
she
fell
into
her
best
tone
of
conversation.
A
pleasing
facility
and
elegance
of
language
gave
fresh
charm
to
familiar

a
new

gently
surprised
and
pleasingly
captivated
the
listener;
unwonted
shades
and
lights
of
expression
elevated
the
young
countenance
with
character,
and
kindled
it
with
animation.
"Caroline,
you
look
as

you
had
heard
good

said
Moore,
after
earnestly
gazing
at
her
for
some
minutes.
"Do
I?"
"I
sent
for
you
this
evening
that
I
might
be
cheered;
but
you
cheer
me
more
than
I
had
calculated."
"I
am
glad
of
that.
And
I
really
cheer
you?"
"You
look
brightly,
move
buoyantly,
speak
musically."
"It
is
pleasant
to
be
here
again."
"Truly
it
is
pleasant;
I
feel
it
so.
And
to
