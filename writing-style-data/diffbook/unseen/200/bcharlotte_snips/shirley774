so
drop
it
henceforward
and
for
ever."
"I
suppose
he
has
more
than
once
behaved
in
this
way,"
thought
Caroline
to
herself,
"and
that
renders
Shirley
so
distant
to
him.
Yet
I
wonder
she
cannot
make
allowance
for
character
and
circumstances.
I
wonder
the
general
modesty,
manliness,
sincerity
of
his
nature

with
her
in
his

The

Them
little
things
wor
like
as
if
they'd
a
keener
sense
nor
grown
up
folks
i'
finding
our
folk's
natures."
Mr.
Hall,
in
answer
to
a
question
of
Miss
Helstone's
as
to
what
he
thought
of
Louis
Moore,
replied
promptly
that
