for
you
why,
I
began
to
flatter
myself
we
were
thoroughly
friends;
that
you
liked
Shirley
almost
as
well
as
Shirley
likes
you,
and
she
does
not
stint
her
regard."
"I
do
like
Shirley.
I
like
her
more
and
more
every
day.
But
that
does
not
make
me
strong
or
happy."
"And
would
it
make
you
strong
or
happy
to
go
and
live
as
a
dependent
amongst
utter
strangers?
It
would
not.
And
the
experiment
must
not
be
tried;
I
tell
you
it
would
fail.
It
is
not
in
your
nature
to
bear
the
desolate
life
governesses
generally
lead;
you
would
fall
ill.
I
won't
hear
of
it."
And
Miss
Keeldar
paused,
having
uttered
this
prohibition
very
decidedly.
Soon
she
recommenced,
still
looking
somewhat
courroucee,
"Why,
it
is
my
daily
pleasure
now
to
look
out
for
the
little
cottage
bonnet
and
the
silk
scarf
glancing
through
the
trees
in
the
lane,
and
to
know
that
my
quiet,
shrewd,
thoughtful
companion
and
monitress
is
coming
back
to
me;
that
I
shall
have
her
sitting
in
the
room
to
look
at,
to
talk
to
or
to
let
alone,
as
she
and
I
please.
This
may
be
a
selfish
sort
of
language
I
