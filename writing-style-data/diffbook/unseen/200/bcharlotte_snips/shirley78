It
is
happy
that
he
can
have
his
own
bliss,
his
own
society
with
his
great
friend
and
goddess
Nature,
quite
independent
of
those
who
find
little
pleasure
in
him,
and
in
whom
he
finds
no
pleasure
at
all.
It
is
just
that
while
the
world
and
circumstances
often
turn
a
dark,
cold
side
to
him
and
properly,
too,
because
he

Even
when

and
pronounce

and
his
art
useless,
he
hears
the
sentence
with
such
a
hard
derision,
such
a
broad,
