value
most.
That
is
to
say
that
I
am
a
traitor
to
all
my
sisters;
that
I
have
acted
as
no
woman
can
act
without
degrading
herself
and
her
sex;
that
I
have
sought
where
the
incorrupt
of
my
kind
naturally
scorn
and
abhor
to
seek.'
She
and
I
were
silent
for
many
a
minute.
'Lucifer,
Star
of
the
Morning,'
she
went
on,
'thou
art
fallen!
You,
once
high
in
my
esteem,
are
hurled
down;
you,
once
intimate
in
my
friendship,
are
cast
out.

had
heard
her
voice
tremble,

calm

would
wait
for
it.
"As
fast,
but
more
quietly
than
before,
the
warm
rain
streamed
down.
There
was
another
sound
in
her
weeping
a
softer,
more
regretful
sound.
While
I
watched,
her
eyes
lifted
to
me
a
gaze
more
reproachful
than
haughty,
more
mournful
than
incensed.
"'O
Moore!'
said
she.
It
was
worse
than
'Et
tu,
Brute!'
"I
relieved
myself
by
what
should
have
been
a
sigh,
but
it
became
a
groan.
A
sense
of
Cain
like
desolation
made
my
breast
