delusion.
But
I
will
write,
and
say
you
advise
his
return."
"Do
not
say
I
advise
his
return,
but
that
his
return
is
advisable."
The
second
bell
rang,
and
Miss
Keeldar
obeyed
its
call.
Louis
Moore
was
used
to
a
quiet
life.
Being
a
quiet
man,
he
endured
it
better
than
most
men
would.
Having
a
large
world
of
his
own
in
his
own
head
and
heart,
he
tolerated
confinement
to
a
small,
still
corner
of
the
real
world
very
patiently.
How
hushed
is
Fieldhead
this
evening!
All
but
Moore
Miss
Keeldar,
the
whole
family
of
the
Sympsons,
even
Henry
are
gone
to
Nunnely.
Sir
Philip
would
have
them
come;
he
wished
to
make
them
acquainted
with
his
mother
and
sisters,
who
are
now
at
the
priory.
Kind
gentleman
as
the
baronet
is,
he
asked
the
tutor
too;
but
the
tutor
would
much
sooner
have
made
an
appointment
with
the
ghost
of
the
Earl
of
Huntingdon
to
meet
him,
and
a
shadowy
ring
of
his
merry
men,
under
the
canopy
of
the
thickest,
blackest,
oldest
oak
in
Nunnely
Forest.
Yes,
he
would
rather
have
appointed
tryst
with
a
phantom
abbess,
or
mist
pale
nun,
among
the
wet
and
weedy
relics
