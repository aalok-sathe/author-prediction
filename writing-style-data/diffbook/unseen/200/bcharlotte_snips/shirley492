though
quiet
aid
of
their
spinster
and
spectacled
lieutenants,
Mary
Ann
Ainley
and
Margaret
Hall,
a
handsome
sum
was
raised;
and
this
being
judiciously
managed,
served
for
the
present
greatly
to
alleviate
the
distress
of
the
unemployed
poor.
The
neighbourhood
seemed
to
grow
calmer.
For
a
fortnight
past
no
cloth
had
been
destroyed;
no
outrage
on
mill
or
mansion
had
been
committed
in
the
three
parishes.
Shirley
was
sanguine
that
the
evil
she
wished
to
avert
was
almost
escaped,
that
the
threatened
storm
was
passing

With
the
approach
of
summer

return
one

With
peace,
what
an
impulse
would
be
given
to
commerce!
Such

tenor
of
her
observations
to
her
tenant,
Gerard
Moore,
whenever
she
met
him
where
they
could
converse;
and
Moore
would
listen
very
quietly
too
quietly
to
satisfy
her.
She
would
then
by
her
impatient
glance
demand
something
more
from
him
some
explanation,
or
at
least
some
additional
remark.
Smiling
in
his
way,
with
that
expression
which
gave
a
remarkable
cast
of
sweetness
to
his
mouth,
while
his
brow
remained
grave,
