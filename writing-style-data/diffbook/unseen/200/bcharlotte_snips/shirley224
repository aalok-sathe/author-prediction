affection;
without
esteem

love
cannot
exist.
Moore,
with
all
his
faults,
might
be
esteemed;
for
he
had
no
moral
scrofula
in
his
mind,
no
hopeless
polluting
taint
such,
for
instance,
as
that
of
falsehood;
neither
was
he
the
slave
of
his
appetites.
The
active
life
to
which
he
had
been
born
and
bred
had
given
him
something
else
to
do
than
to
join
the
futile
chase
of
the
pleasure
hunter.
He
was
a
man
undegraded,
the
disciple
of
reason,
not
the

The

might
be
said
of

Helstone.

for
no

vice
was
lord
of
them;
they
looked
and
were
superior
beings
to
poor
Sykes.
A
sort
of
gathering
and
trampling
sound
was
heard
in
the
yard,
and
then
a
pause.
Moore
walked
to
the
window;
Helstone
followed.
Both
stood
on
one
side,
the
tall
junior
behind
the
under
sized
senior,
looking
forth
carefully,
so
that
they
