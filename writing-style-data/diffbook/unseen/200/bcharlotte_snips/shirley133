in
mademoiselle's
good
graces
for
ever;
a
positive
crime
might
have
been
more
easily
pardoned
than
a
symptom
of
distaste
for
the
foreign
comestibles.
Soon
after
dinner
Caroline
coaxed
her
governess
cousin
upstairs
to
dress.
This
maneauvre
required
management.
To
have
hinted
that
the
jupon,
camisole,
and
curl
papers
were
odious
objects,
or
indeed
other
than
quite
meritorious
points,
would
have
been
a
felony.
Any
premature
attempt
to
urge
their
disappearance
was
therefore
unwise,
and
would
be
likely
to
issue
in
the
persevering
wear
of
them
during
the
whole
day.
Carefully
avoiding
rocks
and
quicksands,
however,
the
pupil,
on
pretence
of
requiring
a
change
of
scene,
contrived
to
get
the
teacher
aloft;
and,
once
in
the
bedroom,
she
persuaded
her
that
it
was
not
worth
while
returning
thither,
and
that
she
might
as
well
make
her
toilet
now;
and
while
mademoiselle
delivered
a
solemn
homily
on
her
own
surpassing
merit
in
disregarding
all
frivolities
of
fashion,
Caroline
denuded
her
of
the
camisole,
invested
her
with
a
decent
gown,
arranged
her
collar,
hair,
etc.,
and
made
her
quite
presentable.
But
Hortense
would
put
the
finishing
touches
herself,
and
these
finishing
touches
consisted
in
a
thick
handkerchief
tied
round
the
throat,
and
