the
widespread
spirit
of
disaffection
against
constituted
authorities
he
regarded
as
the
most
promising
sign
of
the
times;
the
masters,
he
allowed,
were
truly
aggrieved,
but
their
main
grievances
had
been
heaped
on
them
by
a
"corrupt,
base,
and
bloody"
government
(these
were
Mr.
Yorke's
epithets).
Madmen
like
Pitt,
demons
like
Castlereagh,
mischievous
idiots
like
Perceval,

the
tyrants,
the
curses
of

priest

peer

where
a

the
nominal
monarch,
an
unprincipled
debauchee
the

ruler;
where
such
an
insult
to
common

as
hereditary
legislators
was
tolerated;
where
such
