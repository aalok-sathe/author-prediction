in
standing.
I
will
sit
down.
Do
you
feel
unmoved?"
"Hardly
that;
but
I
am
glad
I
came.
We
shall
see
what
transpires
with
our
own
eyes.
We
are
here
on
the
spot,
and
none
know
it.
Instead
of
amazing
the
curate,
the
clothier,
and
the
corn
dealer
with
a
romantic
rush
on
the
stage,
we
stand
alone
with
the
friendly

its
mute
stars,
and
these
whispering
trees,
whose
report
our
friends
will
not
come
to
gather."

Shirley,
the
gates
are
down!
That
crash
was
like
the
felling
of

broken
the
gate.

could
not
be
a
useless
burden
in
his
way;
I
could
be
turned
to
some
account."
"They
come
on!"
cried
Shirley.
"How
steadily
they
march
in!
There
is
discipline
in
their
ranks.
I
will
not
say
there
is
courage
hundreds
against
tens
are
no
proof
of
that
quality

dropped
