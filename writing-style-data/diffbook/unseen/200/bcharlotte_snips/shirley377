the
great,
reverence
the
good,
and
be
joyous
with
the
genial,
was
very
much
the
bent
of
Shirley's
soul:
she
mused,
therefore,
on
the
means
of
following
this
bent
far
oftener
than
she
pondered
on
her
social
superiority.
In
Caroline
Miss
Keeldar
had
first
taken
an
interest
because
she
was
quiet,
retiring,
looked
delicate,
and
seemed
as
if
she
needed
some
one
to
take
care
of
her.
Her
predilection
increased
greatly
when
she
discovered
that
her
own
way
of
thinking
and
talking
was
understood
and
responded
to
by
this
new
acquaintance.
She
had
hardly
expected
it.
Miss
Helstone,
she
fancied,
had
too
pretty
a
face,
manners
and
voice
too
soft,
to
be
anything
out
of
the
common
way
in
mind
and
attainments;
and
she
very
much
wondered
to
see
the
gentle
features
light
up
archly
to
the
reveille
of
a
dry
sally
or
two
risked
by
herself;
and
more
did
she
wonder
to
discover
the
self
won
knowledge
treasured,
and
the
untaught
speculations
working
in
that
girlish,
curl
veiled
head.
Caroline's
instinct
of
taste,
too,
was
like
her
own.
Such
books
as
Miss
Keeldar
had
read
with
the
most
pleasure
were
Miss
Helstone's
delight
also.
They
held
many
aversions
too
