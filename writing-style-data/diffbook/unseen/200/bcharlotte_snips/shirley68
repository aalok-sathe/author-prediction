that
Mr.
Yorke
varied
a
little
in
his
phraseology.
Now
he
spoke
broad
Yorkshire,
and
anon
he
expressed
himself
in
very
pure
English.
His
manner
seemed
liable
to
equal
alternations.
He
could
be
polite
and
affable,
and
he
could
be
blunt
and
rough.
His
station
then
you
could
not
easily
determine
by
his
speech
and
demeanour.
Perhaps
the
appearance
of
his
residence
may
decide
it.
The
men
he
recommended
to
take
the
kitchen
way,
saying
that
he
would
"see
them
served
wi'
summat
to
taste
presently."
The
gentlemen
were
ushered
in
at
the
front
entrance.
They
found
themselves
in
a
matted
hall,
lined
almost
to
the
ceiling
with
pictures.
Through
this
they
were
conducted
to
a
large
parlour,
with
a
magnificent
fire
in
the
grate
the
most
cheerful
of
rooms
it
appeared
as
a
whole,
and
when
you
came
to
examine
details,
the
enlivening
effect
was
not
diminished.
There
was
no
splendour,
but
there
was
taste
everywhere,
unusual
taste
the
taste,
you
would
have
said,
of
a
travelled
man,
a
scholar,
and
a
gentleman.
A
series
of
Italian
views
decked
the
walls.
Each
of
these
was
a
specimen
of
true
art.
A
connoisseur
had
selected
them;
they
were
genuine
and
