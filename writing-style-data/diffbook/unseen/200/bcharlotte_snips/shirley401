returning
from
market,
I
encountered
him
and
Moses
Barraclough,
both
in
an
advanced
stage
of
inebriation.
They
were
praying
in
frantic
sort
at
the
roadside.
They
accosted
me
as
Satan,
bid
me
avaunt,
and
clamoured
to
be
delivered
from
temptation.
Again,
but
a
few
days
ago,
Michael
took
the
trouble
of
appearing
at
the
counting
house
door,
hatless,
in
his
shirt
sleeves
his
coat
and
castor
having
been
detained
at
the
public
house
in
pledge.
He
delivered
himself
of
the
comfortable
message
that
he
could
wish
Mr.
Moore
to
set
his
house
in
order,
as
his
soul
was
likely
shortly
to
be
required
of
him."
"Do
you
make
light
of
these
things?"
"The
poor
man
had
been
drinking
for
weeks,
and
was
in
a
state
bordering
on
delirium
tremens."
"What
then?
He
is
the
more
likely
to
attempt
the
fulfilment
of
his
own
prophecies."
"It
would
not
do
to
permit
incidents
of
this
sort
to
affect
one's
nerves."
"Mr.
Moore,
go
home!"
"So
soon?"
"Pass
straight
down
the
fields,
not
round
by
the
lade
and
plantations."
"It
is
early
yet."
"It
is
late.
For
my
part,
I
am
going
in.
Will
you
promise
me
not
to
wander
in
the
Hollow
