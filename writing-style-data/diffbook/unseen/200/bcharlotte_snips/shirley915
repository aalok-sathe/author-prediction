in
a
crystal
eddy.
"Yorke,"
pursued
Moore,
"ride
on;
I
must
let
him
drink."
Yorke
accordingly
rode
slowly
forwards,
occupying
himself
as
he
advanced
in
discriminating,
amongst
the
many
lights
now
spangling
the
distance,
those
of
Briarmains.
Stilbro'
Moor
was
left
behind;
plantations
rose
dusk
on
either
hand;
they
were
descending
the
hill;
below
them
lay
the
valley
with
its
populous
parish:
they
felt
already
at
home.
Surrounded
no
longer
by
heath,
it
was
not
startling
to
Mr.
Yorke
to
see
a
hat
rise,
and
to
hear
a
voice
speak
behind
the
wall.
The
words,
however,
were
peculiar.
"When
the
wicked
perisheth
there
is
shouting,"
it
said;
and
added,
"As
the
whirlwind
passeth,
so
is
the
wicked
no
more"
(with
a
deeper
growl):
"terrors
take
hold
of
him
as
waters;
hell
is
naked
before
him.
He
shall
die
without
knowledge."
A
fierce
flash
and
sharp
crack
violated
the
calm
of
night.
Yorke,
ere
he
turned,
knew
the
four
convicts
of
Birmingham
were
avenged.
The
die
was
cast.
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
knew
it;
Shirley
knew
it;
Mr.
Sympson
knew
it.
That
evening,
when
all
the
Fieldhead
family
dined
at
Nunnely
Priory,
decided
the
business.
Two
or
three
things
conduced
to
bring
