met
with
since
he
left
Cambridge.
"But
he
is
so
grave,"
objected
Caroline.
"Grave!
the
finest
company
in
the
world!
Full
of
odd,
quiet,
out
of
the
way
humour.
Never
enjoyed
an
excursion
so
much
in
my
life
as
the
one
I
took
with
him
to
the
Lakes.
His
understanding
and
tastes
are
so
superior,
it
does
a
man
good
to
be

"At
Fieldhead
he

"I
don't
think
Miss
Keeldar
likes
him."
"She
doesn't
know
him
she
doesn't
know
him;
otherwise
she
has
sense
enough
to
do
justice
to
his
merits."
"Well,
I
suppose
she
doesn't
know
him,"
mused
Caroline
to
herself,
and
by
this
hypothesis
she
endeavoured
to
account
for
what
seemed
else
unaccountable.
But
such
simple
solution
of
the
difficulty
was
not
left

She
