"He
is
not
ugly,
Shirley,"
pleaded
Caroline;
"he
is
not
ignoble.
He
is
sad;
silence
seals
his

But
I
believe

something

Mr.
Hall
would

I
will
speak
to
him."
He
approached
the
summer
house.
Unconscious
that
it
was
tenanted,
he
sat
down
on
the
step.
Tartar,
now
his
customary
companion,
had
followed
him,
and
he

"Old

said
Louis,
pulling
his
tawny

or

the
mutilated
