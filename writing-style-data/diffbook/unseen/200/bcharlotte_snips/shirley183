Caroline
was
going
to
receive
company,
her
habit
was
to
wring
her
hands
very
nervously,
to
flush
a
little,
and
come
forward
hurriedly
yet
hesitatingly,
wishing
herself
meantime
at
Jericho.
She
was,
at
such
crises,
sadly
deficient
in
finished
manner,
though
she
had
once
been
at
school
a
year.
Accordingly,
on
this
occasion,
her
small
white
hands
sadly
maltreated
each
other,
while
she
stood
up,
waiting
the
entrance
of
Mrs.
Sykes.
In
stalked
that
lady,
a
tall,
bilious
gentlewoman,
who
made
an
ample
and
not
altogether
insincere
profession
of
piety,
and
was
greatly
given
to
hospitality
towards
the
clergy.
In
sailed
her
three
daughters,
a
showy
trio,
being
all
three
well
grown,
and
more
or
less
handsome.
In
English
country
ladies
there
is
this
point
to
be
remarked.
Whether
young
or
old,
pretty
or
plain,
dull
or
sprightly,
they
all
(or
almost
all)
have
a
certain
expression
stamped
on
their
features,
which
seems
to
say,
"I
know
I
do
not
boast
of
it,
but
I
know
that
I
am
the
standard
of
what
is
proper;
let
every
one
therefore
whom
I
approach,
or
who
approaches
me,
keep
a
sharp
lookout,
for
wherein
they
differ
from
me
be
the
same
in
