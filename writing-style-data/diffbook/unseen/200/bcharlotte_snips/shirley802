proved,
indeed,
that
Sir
Philip
liked
her.
Perhaps
he
had
found
in
her
that
"curious
charm"
noticed
by
Mr.
Hall.
He
sought
her
presence
more
and
more,
and
at
last
with
a
frequency
that
attested
it
had
become
to
him
an
indispensable
stimulus.
About
this
time
strange
feelings
hovered
round
Fieldhead;
restless
hopes
and
haggard
anxieties
haunted
some
of
its
rooms.
There
was
an
unquiet
wandering
of
some
of
the
inmates
among
the
still
fields
round
the
mansion;
there
was
a
sense
of
expectancy
that
kept
the
nerves
strained.
One
thing
seemed
clear:
Sir
Philip
was
not
a
man
to
be
despised.
He
was
amiable;
if
not
highly
intellectual,
he
was
intelligent.
Miss
Keeldar
could
not
affirm
of
him,
what
she
had
so
bitterly
affirmed
of
Sam
Wynne,
that
his
feelings
were
blunt,
his
tastes
coarse,
and
his
manners
vulgar.
There
was
sensibility
in
his
nature;
there
was
a
very
real,
if
not
a
very
discriminating,
love
of
the
arts;
there
was
the
English
gentleman
in
all
his
deportment.
As
to
his
lineage
and
wealth,
both
were,
of
course,
far
beyond
her
claims.
His
appearance
had
at
first
elicited
some
laughing
though
not
ill
natured
remarks
from
the
merry
Shirley.
