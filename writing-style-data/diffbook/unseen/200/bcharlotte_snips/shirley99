to
its
opaque
shadows.
Pale
enough
that
ray
was
on
this
particular
morning:
no
colour
tinged
the
east,
no
flush
warmed
it.
To
see
what
a
heavy
lid
day
slowly
lifted,
what
a
wan
glance
she
flung
along
the
hills,
you
would
have
thought
the
sun's
fire
quenched
in
last
night's
floods.
The
breath
of
this
morning
was
chill
as
its
aspect;
a
raw
wind
stirred
the
mass
of
night
cloud,
and
showed,
as
it
slowly
rose,
leaving
a
colourless,
silver
gleaming
ring
all
round
the
horizon,
not
blue
sky,
but
a
stratum
of
paler
vapour
beyond.
It
had
ceased
to
rain,
but
the
earth
was
sodden,
and
the
pools
and
rivulets
were
full.
The
mill
windows
were
alight,
the
bell
still
rung
loud,
and
now
the
little
children
came
running
in,
in
too
great
a
hurry,
let
us
hope,
to
feel
very
much
nipped
by
the
inclement
air;
and
indeed,
by
contrast,
perhaps
the
morning
appeared
rather
favourable
to
them
than
otherwise,
for
they
had
often
come
to
their
work
that
winter
through
snow
storms,
through
heavy
rain,
through
hard
frost.
Mr.
Moore
stood
at
the
entrance
to
watch
them
pass.
He
counted
them
as
they
went
by.
