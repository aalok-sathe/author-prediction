do
we
not?"
"All
of
us
that
have
anything
good
in
our
natures."
"Well,
you
have
Caroline
Helstone."
"Yes.
And
you
have
Mr.
Hall."
"Yes.
Mrs.
Pryor
is
a
wise,
good
woman.
She
can
counsel
you
when
you
need
counsel."
"For
your
part,
you
have
your
brother
Robert."
"For
any
right
hand
defections,
there
is
the
Rev.
Matthewson
Helstone,
M.A.,
to
lean
upon;
for
any
left
hand
fallings
off
there
is
Hiram
Yorke,
Esq.
Both
elders
pay
you
homage."
"I
never
saw
Mrs.
Yorke
so
motherly
to
any
young
man
as
she
is
to
you.
I
don't
know
how
you
have
won
her
heart,
but
she
is
more
tender
to
you
than
she
is
to
her
own
sons.
You
have,
besides,
your
sister
Hortense."
"It
appears
we
are
both
well
provided."
"It
appears
so."
"How
thankful
we
ought
to
be!"
"Yes."
"How
contented!"
"Yes."
"For
my
part,
I
am
almost
contented
just
now,
and
very
thankful.
Gratitude
is
a
divine
emotion.
It
fills
the
heart,
but
not
to
bursting;
it
warms
it,
but
not
to
fever.
I
like
to
taste
leisurely
of
bliss.
Devoured
in
haste,
I
do
not
know
its
flavour."
Still
leaning
on
the
back
of
Miss
Keeldar's
