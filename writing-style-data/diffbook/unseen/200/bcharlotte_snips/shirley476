I
hope
you
won't
take
any
harm."
"That
I
shall,
no
doubt.
He
gave
me
a
turn
I
shall
not
soon
forget.
When
I
sor
him"
(such
was
Mr.
Donne's
pronunciation)
"about
to
spring,
I
thought
I
should
have
fainted."
"Perhaps
you
did
faint
in
the
bedroom;
you
were
a
long
time
there."
"No;
I
bore
up
that
I
might
hold

But

that?
I
declare
the
man
has
told
a
falsehood!
The

is
there!"
And
indeed
Tartar
walked
past
the
glass
door
opening
to
the
garden,
stiff,
tawny,
and
black
muzzled
as
ever.
He
still
seemed
in
bad
humour.
He
was
growling

and
whistling
a
half

being

the
bulldog
side
of
his
ancestry.
