let
them
quite
alone
this
bout,
to
give
them
rope
enough,
certain
that
in
the
end
they
will
hang
themselves."
"Let
them
alone,
will
ye,
Moore?
Do
you
promise
that?"
"Promise!
No.
All
I
mean
to
say
is,
I
shall
give
myself
no
particular
trouble
to
catch
them;
but
if
one
falls
in
my
way

you
reckon
with
them.

will
step
in.
You
will
none
of
you
be
the
worse
of
a
little
refreshment."
Moore
and
Helstone
opposed
this
proposition
as
unnecessary.
It
was,
however,
pressed
on
them
so
courteously,
and
the
night,
besides,
was
so
inclement,
and
the
gleam
from
the
muslin
curtained
windows
of
the
house
before
which
they
had
halted
looked
so
inviting,
that
at
length
they
yielded.
Mr.
Yorke,
after
having
alighted
from
his
gig,
which
he
left
in
charge
of
a
man
who
issued
from
an
outbuilding
on
his
arrival,
led
the
way
in.
It
will
have
been
remarked
