up
a
requisition
on
the
subject,
I
promise
to
head
the
list
of
signatures
with
my
name.
But
you
were
speaking
of
Moore?"
"Ah!
yes.
I
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
understand
Mr.
Moore,
to
know
what
to
think
of
him,
whether
to
like
him
or
not.
He
seems
a
tenant
of
whom
any
proprietor
might
be
proud
and
proud
of
him
I
am,
in
that
sense;
but
as
a
neighbour,
what
is
he?
Again
and
again
I
have
entreated
Mrs.
Pryor
to
say
what
she
thinks
of
him,
but
she
still
evades
returning
a
direct
answer.
I
hope
you
will
be
less
oracular,
Mr.
Helstone,
and
pronounce
at
once.
Do
you
like
him?"
"Not
at
all,
just
now.
His
name
is
entirely
blotted
from
my
good
books."
"What
is
the
matter?
What
has
he
done?"
"My
uncle
and
he
disagree
on
politics,"
interposed
the
low
voice
of
Caroline.
She
had
better
not
have
spoken
just
then.
Having
scarcely
joined
in
the
conversation
before,
it
was
not
apropos
to
do
it
now.
She
felt
this
with
nervous
acuteness
as
soon
as
she
had
spoken,
and
coloured
to
the
eyes.
"What
are
Moore's
politics?"
inquired
Shirley.
"Those
of
a
tradesman,"
