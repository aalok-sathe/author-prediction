and
disdainful
eye
in
short,
our
old
acquaintance,
and
the
rector's
old
enemy,
Mr.
Yorke
the
priest
and
Levite
seized
his
hat,
and
with
the
briefest
of
adieus
to
Miss
Keeldar
and
the
sternest
of
nods
to
her
guest
took
an
abrupt
leave.
Mr.
Yorke
was
in
no
mild
mood,
and
in
no
measured

the
lives
of
far
honester
men
than
themselves."
"What
would
Moore
have
done
if
nobody
had
helped
him?"
asked
Shirley.
"Drunk

he'd
brewed,
eaten
as
he'd
