its
depths
troubled
by
the
reflection.
When
Miss
Ainley
arrived,
she
was
made
kindly
welcome
by
every
one.
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Margaret
Hall
made
room
for
her
on
the
sofa
between
them;
and
when
the
three
were
seated,
they
formed
a
trio
which
the
gay
and
thoughtless
would
have
scorned,
indeed,
as
quite
worthless
and
unattractive
a
middle
aged
widow
and
two
plain,
spectacled
old
maids
yet
which
had
its
own
quiet
value,
as
many
a
suffering
and
friendless
human
being
knew.
Shirley
opened
the
business
and
showed
the
plan.
"I
know
the
hand
which
drew
up
that,"
said
Mr.
Hall,
glancing
at
Miss
Ainley,
and
smiling
benignantly.
His
approbation
was
won
at
once.
Boultby
heard
and
deliberated
with
bent
brow
and
protruded
under
lip.
His
consent
he
considered
too
weighty
to
be
given
in
a
hurry.
Helstone
glanced
sharply
round
with
an
alert,
suspicious
expression,
as
if
he
apprehended
that
female
craft
was
at
work,
and
that
something
in
petticoats
was
somehow
trying
underhand
to
acquire
too
much
influence,
and
make
itself
of
too
much
importance.
Shirley
caught
and
comprehended
the
expression.
"This
scheme
is
nothing,"
said
she
carelessly.
"It
is
only
an
outline
a
mere
suggestion.
You,
gentlemen,
