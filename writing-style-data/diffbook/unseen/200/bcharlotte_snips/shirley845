me
these
family
points."
"Only,
sir,
she
asked
me
whether
I
considered
myself
most
of
a
Keeldar
or
a
Sympson;
and
I
answered
I
was
Keeldar
to
the
core
of
the
heart
and
to
the
marrow
of
the
bones.
She
said
she
was
glad
of
it;
for,
besides
her,
I

the
only
Keeldar

yet.
I
have
the
best
hopes
of
you
both,
with
your
proud
distinctions
a
pair
of
half
fledged
eaglets.
Now,
what
is
your
inference
from
all
you
have
told
me?
Put
it
into
words."
"That
Shirley
thinks
she
is
going
to
die."
"She
referred
to
her
health?"
"Not
