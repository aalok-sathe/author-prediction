have
at
present
to
do.
I
have
told
you
some
of
his
faults,
reader:
as
to
his
good
points,
he
was
one
of
the
most
honourable
and
capable
men
in
Yorkshire;
even
those
who
disliked
him
were
forced
to
respect
him.
He
was
much
beloved
by
the
poor,
because
he
was
thoroughly
kind
and
very
fatherly
to
them.
To
his
workmen
he
was
considerate
and
cordial.
When
he
dismissed
them
from
an
occupation,
he
would
try
to
set
them
on
to
something
else,
or,
if
that
was
impossible,
help
them
to
remove
with
their
families
to
a
district
where
work
might
possibly
be
had.
It
must
also
be
remarked
that
if,
as
sometimes
chanced,
any
individual
amongst
his
"hands"
showed
signs
of
insubordination,
Yorke
who,
like
many
who
abhor
being
controlled,
knew
how
to
control
with
vigour
had
the
secret
of
crushing
rebellion
in
the
germ,
of
eradicating
it
like
a
bad
weed,
so
that
it
never
spread
or
developed
within
the
sphere
of
his
authority.
Such
being
the
happy
state
of
his
own
affairs,
he
felt
himself
at
liberty
to
speak
with
the
utmost
severity
of
those
who
were
differently
situated,
to
ascribe
whatever
was
unpleasant
in
their
position
