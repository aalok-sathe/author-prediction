stooped
a
little
in
walking.
His
countenance,
as
he
came
on,
wore
an
abstracted
and
somewhat
doleful
air;
but
in
approaching
Farren
he
looked
up,
and
then
a
hearty
expression
illuminated
the
preoccupied,
serious
face.
"Is
it
you,
William?
How
are
you?"
he
asked.
"Middling,
Mr.
Hall.
How
are
ye?
Will
ye
step
in
and
rest
ye?"
Mr.
Hall,
whose
name
the
reader
has
seen
mentioned
before
(and
who,
indeed,
was
vicar
of
Nunnely,
of
which
parish
Farren
was
a
native,
and
from
whence
he
had
removed
but
three
years
ago
to
reside
in
Briarfield,
for
the
convenience
of
being
near
Hollow's
Mill,
where
he
had
obtained
work),
entered
the
cottage,
and
having
greeted
the
good
wife
and
the
children,
sat
down.
He
proceeded
to
talk
very
cheerfully
about
the
length
of
time
that
had
elapsed
since
the
family
quitted
his
parish,
the
changes
which
had
occurred
since;
he
answered
questions
touching
his
sister
Margaret,
who
was
inquired
after
with
much
interest;
he
asked
questions
in
his
turn,
and
at
last,
glancing
hastily
and
anxiously
round
through
his
spectacles
(he
wore
spectacles,
for
he
was
short
sighted)
at
the
bare
room,
and
at
the
meagre
and
wan
faces
of
the
