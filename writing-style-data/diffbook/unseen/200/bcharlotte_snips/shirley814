For
one
moment
Shirley
looked
not
quite
certain
whether
she
would
obey
the
request
or
disregard
it.
A
flicker
of
her
eye
beamed
furtive
on
the
professor's
face.
Perhaps
if
he
had
been
looking
at
her
harshly
or
timidly,
or
if
one
undecided
line
had
marked
his
countenance,
she
would
have
rebelled,
and
the
lesson
had
ended
there
and
then;
but
he
was
only
awaiting
her
compliance
as
calm
as
marble,
and
as
cool.
She
threw
the
veil
of
tresses
behind
her
ear.
It
was
well
her
face
owned
an
agreeable
outline,
and
that
her
cheek
possessed
the
polish
and
the
roundness
of
early

contours
might
have
lost
their
grace.
But
what
mattered
that
in
the
present
society?
Neither
Calypso
nor
Eucharis
cared
to
fascinate
Mentor.
She
began
to
read.
The
language
had
become
strange
to
her
tongue;
it
faltered;
the
lecture
flowed
unevenly,
impeded
by
hurried
breath,
broken
by
Anglicized
tones.
She
stopped.
"I
can't
do
it.
Read
me
a
paragraph,
if
you
please,
Mr.
Moore."
What
he
read
she
repeated.
She
caught
his
accent
in
three
minutes.
"Tres
bien,"
was
the
approving
comment
at
the
close
of
the
