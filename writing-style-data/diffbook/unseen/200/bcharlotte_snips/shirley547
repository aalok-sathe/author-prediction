grazing;
a
veil
white
as
an
avalanche
sweeps
from
her
head
to
her
feet,
and
arabesques
of
lightning
flame
on
its
borders.
Under
her
breast
I
see
her
zone,
purple
like
that
horizon;
through
its
blush
shines
the
star
of
evening.
Her
steady
eyes
I
cannot
picture.
They
are
clear,
they
are
deep
as
lakes,
they
are
lifted
and
full
of
worship,
they
tremble
with
the
softness
of
love
and
the
lustre
of
prayer.
Her
forehead
has
the
expanse
of
a
cloud,
and
is
paler
than
the
early
moon,
risen
long
before
dark
gathers.
She
reclines
her
bosom
on
the
ridge
of
Stilbro'
Moor;
her
mighty
hands
are
joined
beneath
it.
So
kneeling,
face
to
face
she
speaks
with
God.
That
Eve
is
Jehovah's
daughter,
as
Adam
was
His
son."
"She
is
very
vague
and
visionary.
Come,
Shirley,
we
ought
to
go
into
church."
"Caroline,
I
will
not;
I
will
stay
out
here
with
my
mother
Eve,
in
these
days
called
Nature.
I
love
her
undying,
mighty
being!
Heaven
may
have
faded
from
her
brow
when
she
fell
in
paradise,
but
all
that
is
glorious
on
earth
shines
there
still.
She
is
taking
me
to
her
bosom,
and
showing
me
