all
cherish
humility
I,
as
you,
my
young
friends;
and
we
may
well
do
it
when
we
look
into
our
own
hearts,
and
see
there
temptations,
inconsistencies,
propensities,
even
we
blush
to
recognize.
And
it
is
not
youth,
nor
good
looks,
nor
grace,
nor
any
gentle
outside
charm
which
makes
either
beauty
or
goodness
in
God's
eyes.
Young
ladies,
when
your
mirror
or
men's
tongues
flatter
you,
remember
that,
in
the
sight
of
her
Maker,
Mary
Ann
Ainley
a
woman
whom
neither
glass
nor
lips
have
ever
panegyrized
is
fairer
and
better
than
either
of
you.
She
is
indeed,"
he
added,
after
a
pause
"she
is
indeed.
You
young
things,
wrapt
up
in
yourselves
and
in
earthly
hopes,
scarcely
live
as
Christ
lived.
Perhaps
you
cannot
do
it
yet,
while
existence
is
so
sweet
and
earth
so
smiling
to
you;
it
would
be
too
much
to
expect.
She,
with
meek
heart
and
due
reverence,
treads
close
in
her
Redeemer's
steps."
Here
the
harsh
voice
of
Donne
broke
in
on
the
mild
tones
of
Mr.
Hall.
"Ahem!"
he
began,
clearing
his
throat
evidently
for
a
speech
of
some
importance
"ahem!
Miss
Keeldar,
your
attention
an
instant,
if
you
please."
"Well,"
said
