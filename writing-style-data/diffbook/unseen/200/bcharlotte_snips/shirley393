has
wrapped
across
her
bust,
and
a
large
bright
gem
glitters
on
the
white
hand
which
confines
it.
Yes,
that
is
Shirley.
Her
companion
then
is,
of
course,
Mrs.
Pryor?
Yes,
if
Mrs.
Pryor
owns
six
feet
of
stature,
and
if
she
has
changed
her
decent
widow's
weeds
for
masculine
disguise.
The
figure
walking
at
Miss
Keeldar's
side
is
a
man
a
tall,
young,
stately
man;
it
is
her
tenant,
Robert
Moore.
The
pair
speak
softly;
their
words
are
not
distinguishable.
To
remain
a
moment
to
gaze
is
not
to
be
an
eavesdropper;
and
as
the
moon
shines
so
clearly
and
their
countenances
are
so
distinctly
apparent,
who
can
resist
the
attraction
of
such
interest?
Caroline,
it
seems,
cannot,
for
she
lingers.
There
was
a
time
when,
on
summer
nights,
Moore
had
been
wont
to
walk
with
his
cousin,
as
he
was
now
walking
with
the
heiress.
Often
had
she
gone
up
the
Hollow
with
him
after
sunset,
to
scent
the
freshness
of
the
earth,
where
a
growth
of
fragrant
herbage
carpeted
a
certain
narrow
terrace,
edging
a
deep
ravine,
from
whose
rifted
gloom
was
heard
a
sound
like
the
spirit
of
the
lonely
watercourse,
moaning
amongst
its
wet
stones,
