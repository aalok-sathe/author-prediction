had
stolen
from
them
to
visit
Henry's
tutor.
Her
pure
white
dress,
her
fair
arms
and
neck,
the
trembling
chainlet
of
gold
circling
her
throat
and
quivering
on
her
breast,
glistened
strangely
amid
the
obscurity
of
the
sickroom.
Her
mien
was
chastened
and
pensive.
She
spoke

"Mr.
Moore,

lips
are
parched.
What
beverage

with
toast
and
water.
I
like
it

Silence
fell

some
minutes.
"Do
you
suffer?
have
