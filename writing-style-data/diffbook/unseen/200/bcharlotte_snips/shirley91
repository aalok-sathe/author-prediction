that
blasphemy
against
God
and
the
king
was
a
deadly
sin,
and
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
'judgment
to
come.'"
Mr.
Yorke
"believed
fully
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
judgment
to
come.
If
it
were
otherwise,
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
how
all
the
scoundrels
who
seemed
triumphant
in
this
world,
who
broke
innocent
hearts
with
impunity,
abused
unmerited
privileges,
were
a
scandal
to
honourable
callings,
took
the
bread
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
poor,
browbeat
the
humble,
and
truckled
meanly
to
the
rich

to
be
properly
paid

in
such

added,
"whenever
he
got
low
spirited
about
such
like
goings

and
their
seeming
success
in
this
mucky
lump
of
a
planet,
he
just
reached
down
t'
owd
book"
(pointing
to
a
great
Bible
in
the
bookcase),
"opened
it
like
at
a
chance,
and
he
was
sure
to
light
of
a
verse
blazing
wi'
a
blue
brimstone
low
that
set
all
straight.
He
knew,"
he
said,
"where
some
folk
war
bound
for,
just
as
weel
as
if
an
angel
wi'
great
white
wings
had
come
in
ower

door
stone
and
