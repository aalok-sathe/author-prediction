to
her
tall
sweetheart
with
the
fullest
confidence
in
his
faith.
"Bonny!"
cried
Mr.
Yorke.
"That's
the
reason
that
he
should
be,
and
proof
that
he
is,
a
scoundrel."
"But
he
looks
too
sorrowful
to
be
false,"
here
interposed
a
quiet
voice
from
behind
the
father's
chair.
"If
he
was
always
laughing,
I
should

name

"Rose,
don't
be
too
forward
to
talk,"
here
interrupted
Mrs.
Yorke,
in
her
usual
kill
joy
fashion,
"nor
Jessy
either.
It
becomes
all
children,
especially
girls,
to
be
silent
in
the
presence
of
their

"Why
