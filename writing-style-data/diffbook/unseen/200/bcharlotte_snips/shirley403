needle
continuously,
ceaselessly,
but
her
brain
worked
faster
than
her
fingers.
Again,
and
more
intensely
than
ever,
she
desired
a
fixed
occupation,
no
matter
how
onerous,
how
irksome.
Her
uncle
must
be
once
more
entreated,
but
first
she
would
consult
Mrs.
Pryor.
Her
head
laboured
to
frame
projects
as
diligently
as
her
hands
to
plait
and
stitch
the
thin
texture
of
the
muslin
summer
dress
spread
on
the
little
white
couch
at
the
foot
of
which
she
sat.
Now
and
then,
while
thus
doubly
occupied,
a
tear
would
fill
her
eyes
and
fall
on
her
busy
hands;
but
this
sign
of
emotion
was
rare
and
quickly
effaced.
The
sharp
pang
passed;
the
dimness
cleared
from
her
vision.
She
would
re
thread
her
needle,
rearrange
tuck
and
trimming,
and
work
on.
Late
in
the
afternoon
she
dressed
herself.
She
reached
Fieldhead,
and
appeared
in
the
oak
parlour
just
as
tea
was
brought
in.
Shirley
asked
her
why
she
came
so
late.
"Because
I
have
been
making
my
dress,"
said
she.
"These
fine
sunny
days
began
to
make
me
ashamed
of
my
winter
merino,
so
I
have
furbished
up
a
lighter
garment."
"In
which
you
look
as
I
like
to
see
you,"
