he,
"the
very
woman!
A
change!
a
change!
Always
fantastical
and
whimsical!
Well,
it's
in
her
sex."
"But
it
is
not
fantasy
and
whim,
uncle."
"What
is
it
then?"
"Necessity,
I
think.
I
feel
weaker
than
formerly.
I
believe
I
should
have
more
to
do."
"Admirable!
She
feels
weak,
and
therefore
she
should
be
set
to

had
escaped
her.
Finding
her
silent,
he
said,
"The
fact
is,
you
don't
know
precisely
what
you
want."
"Only
to
be
a
governess."
"Pooh!
mere
nonsense!
I'll
not
hear

away
and
amuse
