some
fine
charm
to
summer,
some
tranquil
joy
to
autumn,
some
consolation
to
winter,
which
you
do
not
feel.
An
illusion,
of
course;
but
the
fanatics
cling
to
their
dream,
and
would
not
give
it
for
gold.
As
Mr.
Yorke
did
not
possess
poetic
imagination
himself,
he
considered
it
a
most
superfluous
quality
in
others.
Painters
and
musicians
he
could
tolerate,
and
even
encourage,
because
he
could
relish
the
results
of
their
art;
he
could
see
the
charm
of
a
fine
picture,
and
feel
the
pleasure
of
good
music;
but
a
quiet
poet
whatever
force
struggled,
whatever
fire
glowed,
in
his
breast
if
he
could
not
have
played
the
man
in
the
counting
house,
of
the
tradesman
in
the
Piece
Hall,
might
have
lived
despised,
and
died
scorned,
under
the
eyes
of
Hiram
Yorke.
And
as
there
are
many
Hiram
Yorkes
in
the
world,
it
is
well
that
the
true
poet,
quiet
externally
though
he
may
be,
has
often
a
truculent
spirit
under
his
placidity,
and
is
full
of
shrewdness
in
his
meekness,
and
can
measure
the
whole
stature
of
those
who
look
down
on
him,
and
correctly
ascertain
the
weight
and
value
of
the
pursuits
they
disdain
him
for
