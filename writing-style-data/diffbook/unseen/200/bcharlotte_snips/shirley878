her.
Despised
her!
It
was
unutterably
sweet
to
feel
myself
at
once
near
her
and
above
her
to
be
conscious
of
a
natural
right
and
power
to
sustain
her,
as
a
husband
should
sustain
his
wife.
"I
worship
her
perfections;
but
it
is
her
faults,
or
at
least
her
foibles,
that
bring
her
near
to
me,
that
nestle
her
to
my
heart,
that
fold
her
about
with
my
love,
and
that
for
a
most
selfish
but
deeply
natural
reason.
These
faults
are
the
steps
by
which
I
mount
to
ascendency
over
her.
If
she
rose
a
trimmed,
artificial
mound,
without
inequality,
what
vantage
would
she
offer
the
foot?
It
is
the
natural
hill,
with
its
mossy
breaks
and
hollows,
whose
slope
invites
ascent,
whose
summit
it
is
pleasure
to
gain.
"To
leave
metaphor.
It
delights
my
eye
to
look
on
her.
She
suits
me.
If
I
were
a
king
and
she
the
housemaid
that
swept
my
palace
stairs,
across
all
that
space
between
us
my
eye
would
recognize
her
qualities;
a
true
pulse
would
beat
for
her
in
my
heart,
though
an
unspanned
gulf
made
acquaintance
impossible.
If
I
were
a
gentleman,
and
she
waited
on
me
as
a
servant,
