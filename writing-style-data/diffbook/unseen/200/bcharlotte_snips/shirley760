was
not
garrulous.
The
strong
emotion
was
rarely
suffered
to
influence
her
tongue,
and
even
her
eye
refused
it
more
than
a
furtive
and
fitful
conquest.
She
took
Caroline
in
her
arms,
gave
her
one
look,
one
kiss,
then
said,
"You
are
better."
And
a
minute
after,
"I
see
you
are
safe
now;
but
take

God

me?"
she
asked.
"May
I
tell
her
all?"
demanded
Caroline
of
her
mother.
Leave
being
signified
by
a
gesture,
Shirley
was
presently
enlightened
on
what
had
happened
in
her
absence.
"Very
good,"
was
the
cool
comment
"very
good!
But
it
is
no
news
to
me."
"What!
did
you
know?"
"I
guessed
long
since
the
whole
business.
I
have
heard

Pryor's
