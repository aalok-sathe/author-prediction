ten
days,
sneered
at
as
she
would
be
by
all
the
young
coquines
in
your
factory;"
then
softening,
"You
are
very
good,
dear
brother
excuse
my
petulance
but
truly
my
domestic
trials
are
severe,
yet
they
are
probably
my
destiny;
for
I
recollect
that
our
revered
mother
experienced
similar
sufferings,
though
she
had
the
choice
of
all
the
best
servants
in
Antwerp.
Domestics
are
in
all
countries
a
spoiled
and
unruly
set."
Mr.
Moore
had
also
certain
reminiscences
about
the
trials
of
his
revered
mother.
A
good
mother
she
had
been
to
him,
and
he
honoured
her
memory;
but
he
recollected
that
she
kept
a
hot
kitchen
of
it
in
Antwerp,
just
as
his
faithful
sister
did
here
in
England.
Thus,
therefore,
he
let
the
subject
drop,
and
when
the
coffee
service
was
removed,
proceeded
to
console
Hortense
by
fetching
her
music
book
and
guitar;
and
having
arranged
the
ribbon
of
the
instrument
round
her
neck
with
a
quiet
fraternal
kindness
he
knew
to
be
all
powerful
in
soothing
her
most
ruffled
moods,
he
asked
her
to
give
him
some
of
their
mother's
favourite
songs.
Nothing
refines
like
affection.
Family
jarring
vulgarizes;
family
union
elevates.
Hortense,
pleased
with
her
brother,
