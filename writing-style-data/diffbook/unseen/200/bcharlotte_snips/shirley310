of
the
interest
thus
unexpectedly
shown
in
her,
who
usually
met
with
only
coldness
and
ridicule,
by
replying
to
her
candidly.
Communicative
on
her
own
affairs
she
usually
was
not,
because
no
one
cared
to
listen
to
her;
but
to
day
she
became
so,
and
her
confidante
shed
tears
as
she
heard
her
speak,
for
she
told
of
cruel,
slow
wasting,
obstinate
sufferings.
Well
might
she
be
corpse
like;
well
might
she
look
grim,
and
never
smile;
well
might
she
wish
to
avoid
excitement,
to
gain
and
retain
composure!
Caroline,
when
she
knew
all,
acknowledged
that
Miss
Mann
was
rather
to
be
admired
for
fortitude
than
blamed
for
moroseness.
Reader!
when
you
behold
an
aspect
for
whose
constant
gloom
and
frown
you
cannot
account,
whose
unvarying
cloud
exasperates
you
by
its
apparent
causelessness,
be
sure
that
there
is
a
canker
somewhere,
and
a
canker
not
the
less
deeply
corroding
because
concealed.
Miss
Mann
felt
that
she
was
understood
partly,
and
wished
to
be
understood
further;
for,
however
old,
plain,
humble,
desolate,
afflicted
we
may
be,
so
long
as
our
hearts
preserve
the
feeblest
spark
of
life,
they
preserve
also,
shivering
near
that
pale
ember,
a
starved,
ghostly
longing
for
appreciation
