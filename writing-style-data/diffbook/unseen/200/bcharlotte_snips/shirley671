Men
of
England!
look
at
your
poor
girls,
many
of
them
fading
around
you,
dropping
off
in
consumption
or
decline;
or,
what
is
worse,
degenerating
to
sour
old
maids

then
seek
for
them
an

and
an
occupation
which
shall
raise
them
above
the
flirt,
the
maneauvrer,
the
mischief
making

Keep
your
girls'
minds
narrow
and
fettered;
they
will
still
be
a
plague
and
a
care,
sometimes
