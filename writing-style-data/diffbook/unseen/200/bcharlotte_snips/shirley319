was
in
this
position.
Her
sufferings
were
her
only
spur,
and
being
very
real
and
sharp,
they
roused
her
spirit
keenly.
Bent
on
victory
over
a
mortal
pain,
she
did
her
best
to
quell
it.
Never
had
she
been
seen
so
busy,
so
studious,
and,
above
all,
so
active.
She
took
walks
in
all
weathers,
long
walks
in
solitary
directions.
Day
by
day
she
came
back
in
the
evening,
pale
and
wearied
looking,
yet
seemingly
not
fatigued;
for
still,
as
soon
as
she
had
thrown
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl,
she
would,
instead
of
resting,
begin
to
pace
her
apartment.
Sometimes
she
would
not
sit
down
till
she
was
literally
faint.
She
said
she
did
this
to
tire
herself
well,
that
she
might
sleep
soundly
at
night.
But
if
that
was
her
aim
it
was
unattained;
for
at
night,
when
others
slumbered,
she
was
tossing
on
her
pillow,
or
sitting
at
the
foot
of
her
couch
in
the
darkness,
forgetful,
apparently,
of
the
necessity
of
seeking
repose.
Often,
unhappy
girl!
she
was
crying
crying
in
a
sort
of
intolerable
despair,
which,
when
it
rushed
over
her,
smote
down
her
strength,
and
reduced
her
to
childlike
helplessness.
When
thus
prostrate,
