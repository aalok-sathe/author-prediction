the
two
girls
and
the
demure
caps
of
the
elder
ladies,
to
meet
the
winking
glasses
and
gray
pates
of
the
priests.
In
the
discussion
which
ensued,
all
three
gentlemen,
to
their
infinite
credit,
showed
a
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
poor
of
their
parishes
an
even
minute
knowledge
of
their
separate
wants.
Each
rector
knew
where
clothing
was
needed,
where
food
would
be
most
acceptable,
where
money
could
be
bestowed
with
a

of

being
judiciously
laid
out.
Wherever
their
memories
fell

Miss
Ainley
or
Miss
Hall,
if
applied
to,
could
help
them
out;
but
both
ladies
took
care
not
to
speak
unless
spoken

Neither
of
them
wanted
to
be
foremost,
but
each
sincerely
desired
to
be
useful;
and
useful
the
clergy
consented
to
make
them
with
which
boon
they
were
content.
Shirley
stood
behind
the
rectors,
leaning
over
their
shoulders
now
and
then
to
glance
at
the
rules
drawn
up
and
the
list
of
cases
making
out,
listening
to
all
they
said,
and
still
at
intervals
smiling
her
queer
smile
a
smile
not
ill
natured,
but
significant
too
significant
to
be
generally
thought
amiable.
Men
