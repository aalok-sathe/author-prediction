next
it
sank
dim
in
the
socket.
Exhaustion
followed
close
on
excitement.
There
was
always
a
touching
endeavour
to
appear
better,
but
too
often
ability
refused
to
second
will;
too
often
the
attempt
to
bear
up
failed.
The
effort
to
eat,
to
talk,
to
look
cheerful,
was
unsuccessful.
Many
an
hour
passed
during
which
Mrs.
Pryor
feared
that
the
chords
of
life
could
never
more
be
strengthened,
though
the
time
of
their
breaking
might
be
deferred.
During
this
space
the
mother
and
daughter
seemed
left
almost
alone
in
the
neighbourhood.
It
was
the
close
of
August;
the
weather
was
fine
that
is
to
say,
it
was
very
dry
and
very
dusty,
for
an
arid
wind
had
been
blowing
from
the
east
this
month
past;
very
cloudless,
too,
though
a
pale
haze,
stationary
in
the
atmosphere,
seemed
to
rob
of
all
depth
of
tone
the
blue
of
heaven,
of
all
freshness
the
verdure
of
earth,
and
of
all
glow
the
light
of
day.
Almost
every
family
in
Briarfield
was
absent
on
an
excursion.
Miss
Keeldar
and
her
friends
were
at
the
seaside;
so
were
Mrs.
Yorke's
household.
Mr.
Hall
and
Louis
Moore,
between
whom
a
spontaneous
intimacy
seemed
to
have
arisen
