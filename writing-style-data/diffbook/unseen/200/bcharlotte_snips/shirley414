to
be
walking
by
myself
on
deck,
rather
late
of
an
August
evening,
watching
and
being
watched
by
a
full
harvest
moon.
Something
is
to
rise
white
on
the
surface
of
the
sea,
over
which
that
moon
mounts
silent
and
hangs
glorious.
The
object
glitters
and
sinks.
It
rises
again.
I
think
I
hear
it
cry
with
an
articulate
voice;
I
call
you
up
from
the
cabin;
I
show
you
an
image,
fair
as
alabaster,
emerging
from
the
dim
wave.
We
both
see
the
long
hair,
the
lifted
and
foam
white
arm,
the
oval
mirror
brilliant
as
a
star.
It
glides
nearer;
a
human
face
is
plainly
visible
a
face
in
the
style
of
yours
whose
straight,
pure

the
word,
it
is
appropriate)
whose
straight,
pure
lineaments
paleness
does
not
disfigure.
It
looks
at
us,
but
not
with
your
eyes.
I
see
a
preternatural
lure
in
its
wily
glance.
It
beckons.
Were
we
men,
we
should
spring
at
the
sign
the
cold
billow
would
be
dared
for
the
sake
of
the
colder
enchantress;
being
women,
we
stand
safe,
though
not
dreadless.
She
comprehends
our
unmoved
gaze;
she
feels
herself
powerless;
anger
crosses
her
front;
she
cannot
charm,
but
she
