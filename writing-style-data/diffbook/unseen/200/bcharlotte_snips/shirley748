the
result,
probably,
of
harmony
of
views
and
temperament
were
gone
"up
north"
on
a
pedestrian
excursion
to
the
Lakes.
Even
Hortense,
who
would
fain
have
stayed
at
home
and
aided
Mrs.
Pryor
in
nursing
Caroline,
had
been
so
earnestly
entreated
by
Miss
Mann
to
accompany
her
once
more
to
Wormwood
Wells,
in
the
hope
of
alleviating
sufferings
greatly
aggravated
by
the
insalubrious
weather,
that
she
felt
obliged
to
comply;
indeed,
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
refuse
a
request
that
at
once
appealed
to
her
goodness
of
heart,
and,
by
a
confession
of
dependency,
flattered
her
amour
propre.
As
for
Robert,
from
Birmingham
he
had
gone
on
to
London,
where
he
still
sojourned.
So
long
as
the
breath
of
Asiatic
deserts
parched
Caroline's
lips
and
fevered
her
veins,
her
physical
convalescence
could
not
keep
pace
with
her
returning
mental
tranquillity;
but
there
came
a
day
when
the
wind
ceased
to
sob
at
the
eastern
gable
of
the
rectory,
and
at
the
oriel
window
of
the
church.
A
little
cloud
like
a
man's
hand
arose
in
the
west;
gusts
from
the
same
quarter
drove
it
on
and
spread
it
wide;
wet
and
tempest
prevailed
a
while.
When
that
was
