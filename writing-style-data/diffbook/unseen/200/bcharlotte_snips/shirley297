language

Then,
too,
her
imagination
was
full
of
pictures
images
of
Moore,
scenes
where
he
and
she
had
been
together;
winter
fireside
sketches;
a
glowing
landscape
of
a
hot
summer
afternoon
passed
with
him
in
the
bosom
of
Nunnely
Wood;
divine
vignettes
of
mild
spring
or
mellow
autumn
moments,
when
she
had
sat
at
his
side
in
Hollow's
Copse,
listening
to
the
call
of
the
May
cuckoo,
or
sharing
the
September
treasure

a
bird
feeding
its
fledgling.

quite
distinct
in
her
ear;
his
few
caresses
seemed
renewed.
But
these
joys,
being
hollow,
were,
ere
long,
crushed
in.
The
pictures
faded,
the
voice
failed,
the
visionary
clasp
melted
chill
from
her
hand,
and
where
the
warm
seal
of
lips
had
made
impress
on
her
forehead,
it
felt
now
as

a
sleety
rain
drop
had
fallen.
She
