public
will
have
remarked,
ere
this,
that
I
have
thus
far
shown
a
criminal
remissness
in
pursuing,
catching,
and
bringing
to
condign
punishment
the
would
be
assassin
of
Mr.
Robert
Moore.
Here
was
a
fine
opening
to
lead
my
willing
readers
a
dance,
at
once
decorous
and
exciting
a
dance
of
law
and
gospel,
of
the
dungeon,
the
dock,
and
the
"dead
thraw."
You
might
have
liked
it,
reader,
but
I
should
not.
I
and
my
subject
would
presently
have
quarrelled,
and
then
I
should
have
broken
down.
I
was
happy
to
find
that
facts
perfectly
exonerated
me
from
the
attempt.
The
murderer
was
never
punished,
for
the
good
reason
that
he
was
never
caught
the
result
of
the
further
circumstance
that
he
was
never
pursued.
The
magistrates
made
a
shuffling,
as
if
they
were
going
to
rise
and
do
valiant
things;
but
since
Moore
himself,
instead
of
urging
and
leading
them
as
heretofore,
lay
still
on
his
little
cottage
couch,
laughing
in
his
sleeve,
and
sneering
with
every
feature
of
his
pale,
foreign
face,
they
considered
better
of
it,
and
after
fulfilling
certain
indispensable
forms,
prudently
resolved
to
let
the
matter
quietly
drop,
which
they
did.

Moore
