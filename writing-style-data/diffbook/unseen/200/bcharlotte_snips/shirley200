would
neither
drink
it
nor
leave
it.
He
seemed
to
think
that
this
isolated
position
of
his
gave
him
somehow
a
certain
importance,
that
it
was
dignified
and
stately
to
be
the
last,
that
it
was
grand
to
keep
all
the
others
waiting.
So
long
did
he
linger,
that
the
very
urn
died;
it
ceased
to
hiss.
At
length,
however,
the
old
rector
himself,
who
had
hitherto
been
too

engaged
with
Hannah
to
care
for
the

his
movements.

"Let

return

said
he;
which
he
did

and
all
quitted
the
table.
Donne,
nothing
abashed,
still
sat
ten
minutes
quite
alone,
whereupon
Mr.
Helstone
rang
the
bell
for
the
things
to
be
removed.
The
curate
at
length
saw
himself
forced
to
empty
his
cup,
and
to
relinquish
the
role
which,
he
thought,
had
given
him
such
a
felicitous
distinction,
drawing
upon
him
such
flattering
general
notice.
