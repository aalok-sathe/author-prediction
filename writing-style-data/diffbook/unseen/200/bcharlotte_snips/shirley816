and
baffle
research.
It
must
suffice
to
know
that
the
world
then
existed;
that
men
peopled
it;
that
man's
nature,
with
its
passions,
sympathies,
pains,
and
pleasures,
informed
the
planet
and
gave
it
soul.
A
certain
tribe
colonized
a
certain
spot
on
the
globe;
of
what
race
this
tribe
unknown;
in
what
region
that
spot
untold.
We
usually
think
of
the
East
when
we
refer
to
transactions
of
that
date;
but
who
shall
declare
that
there
was
no
life
in
the
West,
the
South,
the
North?
What
is
to
disprove
that
this
tribe,
instead
of
camping
under
palm
groves
in
Asia,
wandered
beneath
island
oak
woods
rooted
in
our
own
seas
of
Europe?
It
is
no
sandy
plain,
nor
any
circumscribed
and
scant
oasis
I
seem
to
realize.
A
forest
valley,
with
rocky
sides
and
brown
profundity
of
shade,
formed
by
tree
crowding
on
tree,
descends
deep
before
me.
Here,
indeed,
dwell
human
beings,
but
so
few,
and
in
alleys
so
thick
branched
and
overarched,
they
are
neither
heard
nor
seen.
Are
they
savage?
Doubtless.
They
live
by
the
crook
and
the
bow;
half
shepherds,
half
hunters,
their
flocks
wander
wild
as
their
prey.
Are
they
happy?
No,
not
more
