I
loosen
from
thy
faculties
fetters!
I
level
in
thy
path
obstacles;
I
with
my
presence
fill
vacancy.
I
claim
as
mine
the
lost
atom
of
life.
I
take
to
myself
the
spark
of
soul
burning
heretofore
forgotten!"
"O
take
me!
O
claim
me!
This
is
a
god."

is
a
son
of
God
one
who

the

Acknowledge

that
Seraph
on
earth
named
Genius."

I
receive
a
revelation.
The
dark
hint,
the
obscure
whisper,
which
have
haunted
me
from
childhood,
are
interpreted.
Thou
art
He

Godborn,
take

thy
bride!"
"Unhumbled,
I

what
is
mine.

the
