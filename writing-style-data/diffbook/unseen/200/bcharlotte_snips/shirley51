and
reflecting.
An
impatient
trampling
of
one
of
the
horses
made
him
presently
look
up.
His
eye
in
the
moment
caught
the
gleam
of
something
white
attached
to
a
part
of
the
harness.
Examined
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
this
proved
to
be
a
folded
paper
a
billet.
It
bore
no
address
without;
within
was
the
superscription:
"To
the
Divil
of
Hollow's
Miln."
We
will
not
copy
the
rest
of
the
orthography,
which
was
very
peculiar,
but
translate
it
into

It

they
have
done
this
deed.
If
you
get
new
machines,
or
if
you
otherwise
go
on
as
you
have
done,
you
shall
hear
from
us
again.
Beware!"
"Hear
from
you
again?
Yes,
I'll
hear
from
you
again,
and
you
shall
hear
from
me.
I'll
speak
to
you
directly.
On
Stilbro'
Moor
you
shall
hear
from
me
in
a
moment."
Having
led
the
wagons
within
the
gates,
he
