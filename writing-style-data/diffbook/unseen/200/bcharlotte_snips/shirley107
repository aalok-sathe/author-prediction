herself.
Accordingly,
as
soon
as
the
said
Robert
was
seated
at
the
breakfast
table,
and
she
had
helped
him
to
a
portion
of
stewed
pears,
and
cut
him
a
good
sized
Belgian
tartine,
she
began
to
pour
out
a
flood
of
amazement
and
horror
at
the
transaction
of
last
night,
the
destruction
of
the
frames.
"Quelle
idee!
to
destroy
them.
Quelle
action
honteuse!
On
voyait
bien
que
les
ouvriers
de
ce
pays
etaient
a
la
fois
betes
et
mechants.
C'etait
absolument
comme
les
domestiques
anglais,
les
servantes
surtout:
rien
d'insupportable
comme
cette
Sara,
par
exemple!"
"She
looks
clean
and
industrious,"
Mr.
Moore
remarked.
"Looks!
I
don't
know
how
she
looks,
and
I
do
not
say
that
she
is
altogether
dirty
or
idle,
mais
elle
est
d'une
insolence!
She
disputed
with
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
yesterday
about
the
cooking
of
the
beef;
she
said
I
boiled
it
to
rags,
that
English
people
would
never
be
able
to
eat
such
a
dish
as
our
bouilli,
that
the
bouillon
was
no
better
than
greasy
warm
water,
and
as
to
the
choucroute,
she
affirms
she
cannot
touch
it!
That
barrel
we
have
in
the
cellar
delightfully
prepared
by
my
own
hands
she
