and
freer
than
the
branch
screened
lattice
of
his
own
apartment,
admitted
unimpeded
the
dark
blue,
the
silver
fleeced,
the
stirring
and
sweeping
vision
of
the
autumn
night
sky.
He
carried
no
candle;
unneeded
was
lamp
or
fire.
The
broad
and
clear
though
cloud
crossed
and
fluctuating
beam
of
the
moon
shone
on
every
floor
and
wall.
Moore
wanders
through
all
the
rooms.
He
seems
following
a
phantom
from
parlour
to
parlour.
In
the
oak
room
he
stops.
This
is
not
chill,
and
polished,
and
fireless
like
the
salon.
The
hearth
is
hot
and
ruddy;
the
cinders
tinkle
in
the
intense
heat
of
their
clear
glow;
near
the
rug
is
a
little
work
table,
a
desk
upon
it,
a
chair
near
it.
Does
the
vision
Moore
has
tracked
occupy
that
chair?
You
would
think
so,
could
you
see
him
standing
before
it.
There
is
as
much
interest
now
in
his
eye,
and
as
much
significance
in
his
face,
as
if
in
this
household
solitude
he
had
found
a
living
companion,
and
was
going
to
speak
to
it.
He
makes
discoveries.
A
bag
a
small
satin
bag
hangs
on
the
chair
back.
The
desk
is
open,
the
keys
are
in
the
