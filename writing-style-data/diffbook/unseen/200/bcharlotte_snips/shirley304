there
were
some
signs.
She
could
see
that
she
was
altered
within
the
last
month;
that
the
hues
of
her
complexion
were
paler,
her
eyes
changed
a
wan
shade
seemed
to
circle
them;
her
countenance
was
dejected
she
was
not,
in
short,
so
pretty
or
so
fresh
as
she
used
to
be.
She
distantly
hinted
this
to
Fanny,
from
whom
she
got
no
direct
answer,
only
a
remark
that
people
did
vary
in
their
looks,
but
that
at
her
age
a
little
falling
away
signified
nothing;
she
would
soon
come
round
again,
and
be
plumper
and
rosier
than
ever.
Having
given
this
assurance,
Fanny
showed
singular
zeal
in
wrapping
her
up
in
warm
shawls
and
handkerchiefs,
till
Caroline,
nearly
smothered
with
the
weight,
was
fain
to
resist
further
additions.
She
paid
her
visits
first
to
Miss
Mann,
for
this
was
the
most
difficult
point.
Miss
Mann
was
certainly
not
quite
a
lovable
person.
Till
now,
Caroline
had
always
unhesitatingly
declared
she
disliked
her,
and
more
than
once
she
had
joined
her
cousin
Robert
in
laughing
at
some
of
her
peculiarities.
Moore
was
not
habitually
given
to
sarcasm,
especially
on
anything
humbler
or
weaker
than
himself;
but
he
had
once
