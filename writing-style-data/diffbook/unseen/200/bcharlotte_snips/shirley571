rather
sit
up
a
little
longer,
if
you
do
not
object,
Shirley.
Here,"
she
continued,
"I
have
brought
the
brace
of
pistols
from
my
uncle's
study.
You
may
examine
them
at
your
leisure."
She
placed
them
on
the
table
before
her
friend.
"Why
would
you
rather
sit
up
longer?"
asked
Miss
Keeldar,
taking
up
the
firearms,
examining
them,
and
again
laying
them
down.
"Because
I
have
a
strange,
excited
feeling
in
my
heart."
"So
have
I."
"Is
this
state
of
sleeplessness
and
restlessness
caused
by
something
electrical
in
the
air,
I
wonder?"
"No;
the
sky
is
clear,
the
stars
numberless.
It
is
a
fine
night."
"But
very
still.
I
hear
the
water
fret
over
its
stony
bed
in
Hollow's
Copse
as
distinctly
as
if
it
ran
below
the
churchyard
wall."
"I
am
glad
it
is
so
still
a
night.
A
moaning
wind
or
rushing
rain
would
vex
me
to
fever
just
now."
"Why,
Shirley?"
"Because
it
would
baffle
my
efforts
to
listen."
"Do
you
listen
towards
the
Hollow?"
"Yes;
it
is
the
only
quarter
whence
we
can
hear
a
sound
just
now."
"The
only
one,
Shirley."
They
both
sat
near
the
window,
and
both
leaned
their
arms
on
the
sill,
