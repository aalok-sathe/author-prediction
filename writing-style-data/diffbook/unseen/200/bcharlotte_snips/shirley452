us
help
each
other
through
seasons
of
want
and
woe
as
well
as
we
can,
without
heeding
in
the
least
the
scruples
of
vain
philosophy."
"But
you
do
help
others,
Shirley.
You
give
a
great
deal
as
it
is."
"Not
enough.
I
must
give
more,
or,
I
tell
you,
my
brother's
blood
will
some
day
be
crying
to
Heaven
against
me.
For,
after
all,
if
political
incendiaries
come
here
to
kindle
conflagration
in
the
neighbourhood,
and
my
property
is
attacked,
I
shall
defend
it
like
a
tigress
I
know
I
shall.
Let
me
listen
to
Mercy
as
long
as
she
is
near
me.
Her
voice
once
drowned
by
the
shout
of
ruffian
defiance,
and
I
shall
be
full
of
impulses
to
resist
and
quell.
If
once
the
poor
gather
and
rise
in
the
form
of
the
mob,
I
shall
turn
against
them
as
an
aristocrat;
if
they
bully
me,
I
must
defy:
if
they
attack,
I
must
resist,
and
I
will."
"You
talk
like
Robert."
"I
feel
like
Robert,
only
more
fierily.
Let
them
meddle
with
Robert,
or
Robert's
mill,
or
Robert's
interests,
and
I
shall
hate
them.
At
present
I
am
no
patrician,
nor
do
I
regard
the
poor
