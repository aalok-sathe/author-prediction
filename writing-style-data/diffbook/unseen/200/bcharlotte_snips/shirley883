expression,
all
insular
grace
and
purity;
but
where
is
there
anything
to
alter,
anything
to
endure,
anything
to
reprimand,
to
be
anxious
about?
There
she
is,
a
lily
of
the
valley,
untinted,
needing
no
tint.
What
change
could
improve
her?
What
pencil
dare
to
paint?
My
sweetheart,
if
I
ever
have
one,
must
bear
nearer
affinity
to
the
rose
a
sweet,
lively
delight
guarded
with
prickly
peril.
My
wife,
if
I
ever
marry,
must
stir
my
great
frame
with
a
sting
now
and
then;
she
must
furnish
use
to
her
husband's
vast
mass
of
patience.
I
was
not
made
so
enduring
to
be
mated
with
a
lamb;
I
should
find
more
congenial
responsibility
in
the
charge
of
a
young
lioness
or
leopardess.
I
like
few
things
sweet
but
what
are
likewise
pungent
few
things
bright
but
what
are
likewise
hot.
I
like
the
summer
day,
whose
sun
makes
fruit
blush
and
corn
blanch.
Beauty
is
never
so
beautiful
as
when,
if
I
tease
it,
it
wreathes
back
on
me
with
spirit.
Fascination
is
never
so
imperial
as
when,
roused
and
half
ireful,
she
threatens
transformation
to
fierceness.
I
fear
I
should
tire
of
the
mute,
monotonous
innocence
of
the
lamb;
