que
mes
amis
ne
s'en
inquietent
pas."
"Tes
amis!
Ou
sont
ils,
tes
amis?"
"Je
fais
echo,
ou
sont
ils?
et
je
suis
fort
aise
que
l'echo
seul
y
repond.
Au
diable
les
amis!
Je
me
souviens
encore
du
moment
ou
mon
pere
et
mes
oncles
Gerard
appellerent
autour
d'eux
leurs
amis,
et
Dieu
sait
si
les
amis
se
sont
empresses
d'accourir
a
leur
secours!
Tenez,
M.
Yorke,
ce
mot,
ami,
m'irrite
trop;
ne
m'en
parlez
plus."
"Comme
tu
voudras."
And
here
Mr.
Yorke
held
his
peace;
and
while
he
sits
leaning
back
in
his
three
cornered
carved
oak
chair,
I
will
snatch
my
opportunity
to
sketch
the
portrait
of
this
French
speaking
Yorkshire
gentleman.
A
Yorkshire
gentleman
he
was,
par
excellence,
in
every
point;
about
fifty
five
years
old,
but
looking
at
first
sight
still
older,
for
his
hair
was
silver
white.
His
forehead
was
broad,
not
high;
his
face
fresh
and
hale;
the
harshness
of
the
north
was
seen
in
his
features,
as
it
was
heard
in
his
voice;
every
trait
was
thoroughly
English
not
a
Norman
line
anywhere;
it
was
an
inelegant,
unclassic,
unaristocratic
mould
of
visage.
Fine
people
would
perhaps
have
called
it
vulgar;
sensible
people
