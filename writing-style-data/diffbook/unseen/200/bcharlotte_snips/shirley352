her
pupil's
off
hand
speeches,
responding,
"My
dear,
do
not
allow
that
habit
of
alluding
to
yourself
as
a
gentleman
to
be
confirmed.
It
is
a
strange
one.
Those
who
do
not
know
you,
hearing
you
speak
thus,
would
think
you
affected
masculine
manners."
Shirley
never
laughed
at
her
former
governess;
even
the
little
formalities
and
harmless
peculiarities
of
that
lady
were
respectable
in
her
eyes.
Had
it
been
otherwise,
she
would
have
proved
herself
a
weak
character
at
once;
for
it
is
only

Therefore

She

lawn
watching
a

of
its
lower
boughs.
Presently
she
began
to
chirrup
to
the
bird;
soon
her
chirrup
grew
clearer;
ere
long
she
was
whistling;
the
whistle
struck
into
a
tune,
and
very
sweetly
and
deftly
it
was
executed.
"My
dear!"
expostulated
Mrs.
Pryor.
"Was
I
whistling?"
said
Shirley.
"I
forgot.
I
beg
your
pardon,
ma'am.
I
had
resolved
to
take
care
not
to
whistle
before
you."
"But,
Miss
Keeldar,
where
did
you
learn
to
whistle?
You
must
have
got
the
habit
since
