folded
his
arms,
and
gazed
into
the
fire;
he
occasionally
turned
his
head
towards
the
window;
he
looked
at
intervals
at
his
watch;
in
short,
his
mind
appeared
preoccupied.
Perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
the
beauty
of
the
weather
for
it
was
a
fine
and
mild
morning
for
the
season
and
wishing
to
be
out
in
the
fields
enjoying
it.
The
door
of
his
counting
house
stood
wide
open.
The
breeze
and
sunshine
entered
freely;
but
the
first
visitant
brought
no
spring
perfume
on
its
wings,
only
an
occasional
sulphur
puff
from
the
soot
thick
column
of
smoke
rushing
sable
from
the
gaunt
mill
chimney.
A
dark
blue
apparition
(that
of
Joe
Scott,
fresh
from
a
dyeing
vat)
appeared
momentarily
at
the
open
door,
uttered
the
words
"He's
comed,
sir,"
and
vanished.
Mr.
Moore
raised
not
his
eyes
from
the
paper.
A
large
man,
broad
shouldered
and
massive
limbed,
clad
in
fustian
garments
and
gray
worsted
stockings,
entered,
who
was
received
with
a
nod,
and
desired
to
take
a
seat,
which
he
did,
making
the
remark,
as
he
removed
his
hat
(a
very
bad
one),
stowed
it
away
under
his
chair,
and
wiped
his
forehead
with
a
spotted
cotton
handkerchief
