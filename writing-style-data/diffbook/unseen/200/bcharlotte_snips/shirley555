you
well
off?"
"Miss
Shirley,
I
am
varry
well
off.
Since
I
got
into
t'
gardening
line,
wi'
Mr.
Yorke's
help,
and
since
Mr.
Hall
(another
o'
t'
raight
sort)
helped
my
wife
to
set
up
a
bit
of
a
shop,
I've
nought
to
complain
of.
My
family

I'll
say

"But
what
can
be
done?
What
more
can
I
do,
for
instance?"
"Do?
Ye
can
do
not
mich,
poor
young
lass!
Ye've
gi'en
your
brass;
ye've
done
well.
If
ye
could
transport
your
tenant,
Mr.
Moore,
to
Botany
Bay,
ye'd
happen
do
better.
Folks
hate
him."
"William,

exclaimed
Caroline

"If
folks
do
hate
