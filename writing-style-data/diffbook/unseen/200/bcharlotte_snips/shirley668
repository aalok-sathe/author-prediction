houseless

poor,

not
ask
for
a
place
and

world;
the
demand
disturbs
the
happy
and

Look
at
the
numerous
families
of
girls
in
this
neighbourhood
the
Armitages,
the
Birtwhistles,
the
Sykeses.
The
brothers
of
these
girls
are
every
one
in
business
or
in
professions;
they
have
something
to
do.
Their
sisters
have
no
earthly

They
are

and
their
minds
and
views
shrink
to
wondrous
narrowness.
The

aim
of

of
them
is
to
be
married,
but
the
majority
will
never
marry;
they
will
die
as
they
now

They
scheme,
they
plot,
they
dress
to
ensnare
husbands.
The
gentlemen
turn
them
into
ridicule;
they
don't
want
them;
they
hold
them
very
cheap.
They
say
I

heard

say

with
sneering
laughs
many
a
time
the
matrimonial
market

overstocked.
Fathers
say
so
