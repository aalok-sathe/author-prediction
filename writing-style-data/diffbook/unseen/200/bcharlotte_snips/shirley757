prize."
"Valuable
and
pretty?"
"Invaluable
and
sweet
to
me."
"Show
it,
mamma.
Is
it
here
or
at
Fieldhead?"
"It
is
talking
to
me
now,
leaning
on
me.
Its
arms
are
round
me."
"Ah,
mamma,
you
mean
your
teasing
daughter,
who
will
never
let
you
alone;
who,
when
you
go

"And

each

Cary?"
"How
miserable
we
should
be!
Mother,
before

I
had
an
apprehension
that
you
were
not
good
that
I
could
not
esteem
you.
That
dread
damped
my
wish
to
see
you.
And
now
my
heart
is
