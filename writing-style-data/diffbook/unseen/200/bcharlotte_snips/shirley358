distinctly."
"That
break
is
a
dell
a
deep,
hollow
cup,
lined
with
turf
as
green
and
short
as
the
sod
of
this
common.
The
very
oldest
of
the
trees,
gnarled
mighty
oaks,
crowd
about
the
brink
of
this
dell.
In
the
bottom
lie
the
ruins
of
a
nunnery."
"We
will
go
you
and
I
alone,
Caroline
to
that
wood,
early
some
fine
summer
morning,
and
spend
a
long
day
there.
We
can
take
pencils
and
sketch
books,
and
any
interesting
reading
book
we
like;
and
of
course
we
shall
take
something
to
eat.
I
have
two
little
baskets,
in
which
Mrs.
Gill,
my
housekeeper,
might
pack
our
provisions,
and
we
could
each
carry
our
own.
It
would
not
tire
you
too
much
to
walk
so
far?"
"Oh
no;
especially
if
we
rested
the
whole
day
in
the
wood.
And
I
know
all
the
pleasantest
spots.
I
know
where
we
could
get
nuts
in
nutting
time;
I
know
where
wild
strawberries
abound;
I
know
certain
lonely,
quite
untrodden
glades,
carpeted
with
strange
mosses,
some
yellow
as
if
gilded,
some
a
sober
gray,
some
gem
green.
I
know
groups
of
trees
that
ravish
the
eye
with
their
perfect,
picture
like
effects
rude
