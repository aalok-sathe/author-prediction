up
his
own
daughter,
if
he
had
had
one;
and
that
is
kindness.
But
I
am
not
fond
of
him.
I
would
rather
be
out
of
his
presence
than
in
it."
"Strange,
when
he
has
the
art
of
making
himself
so
agreeable."
"Yes,
in
company;
but
he
is
stern
and
silent
at
home.
As
he
puts
away
his
cane
and
shovel
hat
in
the
rectory
hall,
so
he

his

"Is

"Oh
yes!
Good
nature
implies
indulgence,
which
he
has
not;
geniality,
warmth
of
heart,
which
he
does
not
own;
and
genuine
justice
is
the
offspring
of
sympathy
and
considerateness,
of
which,
I
can
well
conceive,
my
bronzed
old
friend
is
quite
innocent."
"I
often
wonder,
Shirley,

most
men
