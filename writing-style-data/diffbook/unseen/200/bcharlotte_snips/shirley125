taste;
curls
became
her,
and
she
possessed
them
in
picturesque
profusion.
Her
style
of
dress
announced
taste
in
the
wearer
very
unobtrusive
in
fashion,
far
from
costly
in
material,
but
suitable
in
colour
to
the
fair
complexion
with
which
it
contrasted,
and
in
make
to
the
slight
form
which
it
draped.
Her
present
winter
garb
was
of
merino
the
same
soft
shade
of
brown
as
her
hair;
the
little
collar
round
her
neck
lay
over
a
pink
ribbon,
and
was
fastened
with
a
pink
knot.
She
wore
no
other
decoration.
So
much
for
Caroline
Helstone's
appearance.
As
to
her
character
or
intellect,
if
she
had
any,
they
must
speak
for
themselves
in
due
time.
Her
connections
are
soon
explained.
She
was
the
child
of
parents
separated
soon
after
her
birth,
in
consequence
of
disagreement
of
disposition.
Her
mother
was
the
half
sister
of
Mr.
Moore's
father;
thus,
though
there
was
no
mixture
of
blood,
she
was,
in
a
distant
sense,
the
cousin
of
Robert,
Louis,
and
Hortense.
Her
father
was
the
brother
of
Mr.
Helstone
a
man
of
the
character
friends
desire
not
to
recall,
after
death
has
once
settled
all
earthly
accounts.
He
had
rendered
his
wife
unhappy.
