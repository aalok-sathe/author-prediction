find
little
worthy
of
your
sympathies
in
the
ordinary
world.
The
ordinary
world
every
day
honest
folks
are
better
than
you
think
them,
much
better
than
any
bookish,
romancing
chit
of
a
girl
can
be
who
hardly
ever
puts
her
nose
over
her
uncle
the
parson's
garden
wall."
"Consequently
of
whom
you
know
nothing.
Excuse
me
indeed,
it
does
not
matter
whether
you
excuse
me
or
not
you
have
attacked
me
without
provocation;
I
shall
defend
myself
without
apology.
Of
my
relations
with
my
two
cousins
you
are
ignorant.
In
a
fit
of
ill
humour
you
have
attempted
to
poison
them
by
gratuitous
insinuations,
which
are
far
more
crafty
and
false
than
anything
with
which
you
can
justly
charge
me.
That
I
happen
to
be
pale,
and
sometimes
to
look
diffident,
is
no
business
of
yours;
that
I
am
fond
of
books,
and
indisposed
for
common
gossip,
is
still
less
your
business;
that
I
am
a
'romancing
chit
of
a
girl'
is
a
mere
conjecture
on
your
part.
I
never
romanced
to
you
nor
to
anybody
you
know.
That
I
am
the
parson's
niece
is
not
a
crime,
though
you
may
be
narrow
minded
enough
to
think
it
so.
