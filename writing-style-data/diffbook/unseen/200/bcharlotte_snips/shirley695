for
her
living
honestly,
instead
of
passing
a
useless
life,
and
eating
the
bread
of
idleness
in
the
shape
of
tithes.
Thence
Jessie
passed
to
a
review
of
the
ministry
at
that
time
in
office,
and
a
consideration
of
its
deserts.
She
made
familiar
mention
of
the
names
of
Lord
Castlereagh
and
Mr.
Perceval.
Each
of
these
personages
she
adorned
with
a
character
that
might
have
separately
suited
Moloch
and
Belial.
She
denounced
the
war
as
wholesale
murder,
and
Lord
Wellington
as
a
"hired
butcher."
Her
auditress
listened
with
exceeding
edification.
Jessie
had
something
of
the
genius
of
humour
in
her
nature.
It
was
inexpressibly
comic
to
hear
her
repeating
her
sire's
denunciations
in
his
nervous
northern
Doric;
as
hearty
a
little
Jacobin
as
ever
pent
a
free
mutinous
spirit
in
a
muslin
frock
and
sash.
Not
malignant
by
nature,
her
language
was
not
so
bitter
as
it
was
racy,
and
the
expressive
little
face
gave
a
piquancy
to
every
phrase
which
held
a
beholder's
interest
captive.
Caroline
chid
her
when
she
abused
Lord
Wellington;
but
she
listened
delighted
to
a
subsequent
tirade
against
the
Prince
Regent.
Jessie
quickly
read,
in
the
sparkle
of
her
hearer's
eye
and
the
laughter
