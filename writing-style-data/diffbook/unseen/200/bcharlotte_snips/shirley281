a
family,
like
me,
I
should
think
your
case
pretty
nigh
desperate;
but
the
young
and
unencumbered
have
chances
peculiar
to
themselves.
I
hear
gossip
now
and
then
about
your
being
on
the
eve
of
marriage
with
this
miss
and
that;
but
I
suppose
it
is
none

thousands,
who
would
suit
both

affairs."
"I
wonder
where?"
"Would
you
try
if
you
had
a
chance?"
"I
don't
know.
It
depends
