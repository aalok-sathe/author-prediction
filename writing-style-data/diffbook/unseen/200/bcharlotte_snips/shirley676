cherish

and
that
others
should,
repels
them
with
a
sense
of
crude
romance.
The
first
movement,
in
short,
excited
by
such
discovery
(as
with
many
parents
on
finding
their
children
to
be
in
love)
is
one
of
mixed
impatience
and
contempt.
Reason
if
they
be
rational
people
corrects
the
false
feeling
in
time;
but
if
they
be
irrational,
it
is
never
corrected,
and
the
daughter
or
sister
in
law
is
disliked
to
the
end.
"You
would
expect
to
find
me
alone,
from
what
I
said
in
my
note,"
observed
Miss
Moore,
as
she
conducted
Caroline
towards
the
parlour;
"but
it
was
written
this
morning:
since
dinner,
company
has
come
in."
And
opening
the
door
she
made
visible
an
ample
spread
of
crimson
skirts
overflowing
the
elbow
chair
at
the
fireside,
and
above
them,
presiding
with
dignity,
a
cap
more
awful
than
a
crown.
That
cap
had
never
come
to
the
cottage
under
a
bonnet;
no,
it
had
been
brought
in
a
vast
bag,
or
rather
a
middle
sized
balloon
of
black
silk,
held
wide
with
whalebone.
The
screed,
or
frill
of
the
cap,
stood
a
quarter
of
a
yard
broad
round
the
face
of
the
wearer.
