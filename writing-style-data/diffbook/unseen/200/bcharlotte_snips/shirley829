Moore
paused
on
this
observation
before
he
replied
to
it.
His
look,
at
once
struck
and
meditative,
said,
"A
strange
phrase;
what
may
it
mean?"
He
turned
it
over
in
his
mind,
with
thought
deep
and
slow,
as
some
German
pondering
metaphysics.
"You
mean,"
he
said
at

"that
some
men

repugnance,
and
so
chill
the
kind
heart."
"Ingenious!"
responded
Shirley.
"If

Let
us
begin."
"I
have
forgotten
the
very
first
line."
"Which
I
have
not.
My
memory,
if
a
slow,
is
a
retentive
one.
I
acquire
deliberately
both
knowledge
and
liking.
The
acquisition
grows
into
my
brain,
and
the
sentiment
into
my
breast;
and
it
is
not
