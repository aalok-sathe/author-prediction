be;
but
Moore
is
alone
there.
He
has
sent
all
the
workmen
he
can
trust
to
Stilbro';
there
are
only
two
women
left
about
the
place.
It
would
be
a
nice
opportunity
for
any
of
his
well
wishers
to
pay
him
a
visit,
if
they
knew
how
straight
the
path
was
made
before
them."
"I
am
none
of
his
well
wishers,
sir.
I
don't

does
not
take
place
of
which,
indeed,
I
see
no
signs
yet
it
is
unlikely
this
night
will
pass
quite
tranquilly.
You
know
Moore
has
resolved
to
have
new
machinery,
and
he
expects
two
wagon
loads
of
frames
and
shears
from
Stilbro'
this
evening.
Scott,
the
overlooker,
and
a
few
picked
men
are
gone
to
fetch
them."
"They
will
bring
them
in
safely
and

sir."
