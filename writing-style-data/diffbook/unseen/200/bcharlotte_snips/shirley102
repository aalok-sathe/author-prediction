baskets
which
contained
their
allowance
of
bread.
Let
us
hope
they
have
enough
to
eat;
it
would
be
a
pity
were
it
otherwise.
And
now
at
last
Mr.
Moore
quitted
the
mill
yard,
and
bent
his
steps
to
his
dwelling
house.
It
was
only
a
short
distance
from
the
factory,
but
the
hedge
and
high
bank
on
each
side
of
the
lane
which
conducted
to
it
seemed
to
give
it
something
of
the
appearance
and
feeling
of
seclusion.
It
was
a
small,
whitewashed
place,
with
a
green
porch
over
the
door;
scanty
brown
stalks
showed
in
the
garden
soil
near
this
porch,
and
likewise
beneath
the
windows
stalks
budless
and
flowerless
now,
but
giving
dim
prediction
of
trained
and
blooming
creepers
for
summer
days.
A
grass
plat
and
borders
fronted
the
cottage.
The
borders
presented
only
black
mould
yet,
except
where,
in
sheltered
nooks,
the
first
shoots
of
snowdrop
or
crocus
peeped,
green
as
emerald,
from
the
earth.
The
spring
was
late;
it
had
been
a
severe
and
prolonged
winter;
the
last
deep
snow
had
but
just
disappeared
before
yesterday's
rains;
on
the
hills,
indeed,
white
remnants
of
it
yet
gleamed,
flecking
the
hollows
and
crowning
the
peaks;
the
lawn
