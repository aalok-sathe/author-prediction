it
is
very
seldom
that
the
respectable
people
wear
anything
else
for
walking
in
winter.
Let
any
one
try
to
wade
the
mud
of
the
Flemish
chaussees
in
a
pair
of
Paris
brodequins,
on
m'en
dirait
des
nouvelles!"
"Never
mind
Mons
and
Leuze
and
the
Flemish
chaussees;
do
at
Rome
as
the
Romans
do.
And
as
to
the
camisole
and
jupon,
I
am
not
quite

consequence
than
she
ought
to
be.
At

she
is
modest
and
unassuming:
let

so."
"With
all
my
heart.
Is
she
coming
this

"She
will
come
at

as

to
take
her
French
lesson."
"You
don't
find
that
she
