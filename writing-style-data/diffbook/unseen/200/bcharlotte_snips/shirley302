was;
and
when
the
latter
remarked
that
the
day
was
fine,
and
she
ought
to
take
a
walk,
she
only
said,
"It
is
cold."
"You
are
very
diligent
at
that
sewing,
Miss
Caroline,"
continued
the
girl,
approaching
her
little
table.
"I
am
tired
of
it,
Fanny."
"Then
why
do
you
go
on
with
it?
Put
it

Read,
or
do
something
to
amuse

"It
is

in

house,
Fanny.
Don't
you
think
so?"

see
you."
"But
their
houses
are
dismal:
they
are
both
old
maids.
I
am
certain
old
maids
are
a
very
unhappy
race."
"Not
they,
miss.
They
can't
be
unhappy;
they
take
such
care
of
themselves.
They
are
all
selfish."
"Miss
Ainley
is
not
selfish,
Fanny.
She
is
always
doing
good.
How
devotedly
kind

was
to
her
step
mother
as

as
the
old
lady
lived;
