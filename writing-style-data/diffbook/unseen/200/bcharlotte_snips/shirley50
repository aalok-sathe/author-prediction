there
was
a
run.
The
wagons
stood
still;
they
were
now
deserted.
"Joe
Scott!"
No
Joe
Scott
answered.
"Murgatroyd!
Pighills!
Sykes!"
No
reply.
Mr.
Moore
lifted
his
lantern
and
looked
into
the
vehicles.
There
was
neither
man
nor
machinery;
they
were
empty
and
abandoned.
Now
Mr.
Moore
loved
his
machinery.
He
had
risked
the
last
of
his
capital
on
the
purchase
of
these
frames
and
shears
which
to
night
had
been
expected.
Speculations
most

in
his
life
where
this
determined
spirit
is
to
feel
a
demand
on
its
strength,
when
the
strain
is
to
be
made,
and
the
faculty
must
bear
or
break.
Yet
he
remained
silent,
and
even
motionless;
for
at
the
instant
he
neither
knew
what
to
say
nor
what
to
do.
He
placed
the
lantern
on
the
ground,
and
stood
with
his
arms
folded,
gazing
