she
found
it
all
dark,
Miss
Keeldar
having
extinguished
the
candle.
The
outline
of
her
shape
was
visible
near
the
still
open
window,
leaning
out.
Miss
Helstone
asked
no
questions;
she
stole
to
her
side.
The
dog
recommenced
barking
furiously.
Suddenly
he
stopped,
and
seemed
to
listen.
The
occupants
of
the
dining
room
listened
too,
and
not
merely
now

screen
between

and
this
they
felt
as
the
troop
trod
forwards,
and
seemed
actually
passing
the
rectory.
They
felt
it

when
a
human
voice
though
that
voice
spoke
