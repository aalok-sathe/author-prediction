why;
I
would
not
permit
myself
to
inquire.
I
never
do
indulge
in
scrutiny
either
of
her
language
or
countenance;
for
if
I
did,
I
should
sometimes
forget
common
sense
and
believe
in
romance.
A
strange,
secret
ecstasy
steals
through
my
veins
at
moments.
I'll
not
encourage
I'll
not
remember
it.
I
am
resolved,
as
long
as
may
be,
to
retain
the
right
to

with
Paul,
'I

the
request?
Shall
I
apologize
to
her?
I
could
in
all
humility;
but
would
an
apology
tend
to
place
us
in
the
positions
we
ought
relatively
to
occupy
in
this
matter?
I
must
keep
up
the
professor,
otherwise
I
hear
a
door."
He
waited.
Many
minutes
passed.
"She
will
refuse

Henry
is
entreating
her

she
declines.
My
petition
