in
some
way;
I
can
hardly
bear
it."
"Who
knows
but,
if
we
talk
it
over,
we
may
relieve
it?
What
is
the
cause?
Whom
does
it
concern?"
"The
cause,
sir,
is
Shirley;
it
concerns
Shirley."
"Does
it?
You
think
her
changed?"
"All
who
know
her
think
her
changed
you
too,
Mr.
Moore."
"Not
seriously
no.
I
see
no
alteration
but
such
as
a
favourable
turn
might
repair
in
a
few
weeks;
besides,
her
own
word
must
go
for
something:
she
says
she
is
well."
"There
it
is,
sir.
As
long
as
she
maintained
she
was
well,
I
believed
her.
When
I
was
sad
out
of
her
sight,
I
soon
recovered
spirits
in
her
presence.
Now
"
"Well,
Harry,
now.
Has
she
said
anything
to
you?
You
and
she
were
together
in
the
garden
two
hours
this
morning.
I
saw
her
talking,
and
you
listening.
Now,
my
dear
Harry,
if
Miss
Keeldar
has
said
she
is
ill,
and
enjoined
you
to
keep
her
secret,
do
not
obey
her.
For
her
life's
sake,
avow
everything.
Speak,
my
boy."
"She
say
she
is
ill!
I
believe,
sir,
if
she
were
dying,
she
would
smile,
and
aver,
'Nothing
ails
me.'"
"What
have
you
