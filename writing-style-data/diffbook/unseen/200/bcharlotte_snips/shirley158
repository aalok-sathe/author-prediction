have
made
even
plain
features
striking;
but
there
was
not
the
grievous
defect
of
plainness
to
pardon
in
her
case.
The
sunshine
was
not
shed
on
rough
barrenness;
it
fell
on
soft
bloom.
Each
lineament
was
turned
with
grace;
the
whole
aspect
was
pleasing.
At
the
present
moment
animated,
interested,
touched
she
might
be
called
beautiful.
Such
a
face
was
calculated
to
awaken
not
only
the
calm
sentiment
of
esteem,
the
distant
one
of
admiration,
but
some
feeling
more
tender,
genial,
intimate
friendship,
perhaps,
affection,
interest.
When
she
had
finished,
she
turned
to
Moore,
and
met
his
eye.
"Is
that
pretty
well
repeated?"
she
inquired,
smiling
like
any
happy,
docile
child.
"I
really
don't
know."
"Why
don't
you
know?
Have
you
not
listened?"
"Yes
and
looked.
You
are
fond
of
poetry,
Lina?"
"When
I
meet
with
real
poetry,
I
cannot
rest
till
I
have
learned
it
by
heart,
and
so
made
it
partly
mine."
Mr.
Moore
now
sat
silent
for
several
minutes.
It
struck
nine
o'clock.
Sarah
entered,
and
said
that
Mr.
Helstone's
servant
was
come
for
Miss
Caroline.
"Then
the
evening
is
gone
already,"
she
observed,
"and
it
will
be
long,
I
suppose,
before
I
pass
another
here."
