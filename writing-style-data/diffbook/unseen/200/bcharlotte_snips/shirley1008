old
lady."
"She
is
not
old,
Robert."
"Of
the
young
lady,
then."
"She
does
not
pretend
to
be
young."
"Well,
of
the
matron.
But
you
said
'mamma's'
affection
was
one
thing
that
made
you
happy;
now
for
the
other
thing."
"I
am
glad
you
are
better."
"What
besides?"
"I
am
glad
we
are
friends."
"You
and
I?"
"Yes.
I
once
thought
we
never
should
be."
"Cary,
some
day
I
mean
to
tell
you
a

"I

"Whom
does
it
concern
besides
me?"
She
coloured;
she
hesitated;
she
was
silent.
"Speak,
Cary!
Whom
does
it
concern?"
She
tried
to
utter
a
name,
and
could
not.
"Tell
me;
there
is
none
present
but
ourselves.
Be
frank."
"But
if
I
guess
wrong?"
"I
will
forgive.
Whisper,
Cary."
He
bent
his
ear
to
her
lips.
Still
she
would
not,
or
could
not,
speak
clearly
to
