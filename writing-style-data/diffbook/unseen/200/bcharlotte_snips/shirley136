back,
as
one
of
the
first
"duties
of
a
woman."
She
herself
had
had
a
needle,
cotton,
and
a
fearfully
torn
stocking
put
into
her
hand
while
she
yet
wore
a
child's
coif
on
her
little
black
head;
her
"hauts
faits"
in
the
darning
line
had
been
exhibited
to
company
ere
she
was
six
years
old;
and
when
she
first
discovered
that
Caroline
was
profoundly
ignorant
of
this
most
essential
of
attainments,
she
could
have
wept
with
pity
over
her
miserably
neglected
youth.
No
time
did
she
lose
in
seeking
up
a
hopeless
pair
of
hose,
of
which
the
heels
were
entirely
gone,
and
in
setting
the
ignorant
English
girl
to
repair
the
deficiency.
This
task
had
been
commenced
two
years
ago,
and
Caroline
had
the
stockings
in
her
work
bag
yet.
She
did
a
few
rows
every
day,
by
way
of
penance
for
the
expiation
of
her
sins.
They
were
a
grievous
burden
to
her;
she
would
much
have
liked
to
put
them
in
the
fire;
and
once
Mr.
Moore,
who
had
observed
her
sitting
and
sighing
over
them,
had
proposed
a
private
incremation
in
the
counting
house;
but
to
this
proposal
Caroline
knew
it
would
have
been
impolitic
