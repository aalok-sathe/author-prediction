Council
have
cut
that
off."
Malone
did
not
seem
prepared
to
carry
on
briskly
a
conversation
of
this
sort.
He
began
to
knock
the
heels
of
his
boots
together,
and
to
yawn.
"And
then
to
think,"
continued
Mr.
Moore
who
seemed
too
much
taken
up
with
the
current
of
his
own
thoughts
to
note
the
symptoms
of
his
guest's
ennui
"to
think
that
these
ridiculous
gossips
of
Whinbury
and
Briarfield
will
keep
pestering
one
about
being
married!
As
if
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
in
life
but
to
'pay
attention,'
as
they
say,
to
some
young
lady,
and
then
to
go
to
church
with
her,
and
then
to
start
on
a
bridal
tour,
and
then
to
run
through
a
round
of
visits,
and
then,
I
suppose,
to
be
'having
a
family.'
Oh,
que
le
diable
emporte!"
He
broke
off
the
aspiration
into
which
he
was
launching
with
a
certain
energy,
and
added,
more
calmly,
"I
believe
women
talk
and
think
only
of
these
things,
and
they
naturally
fancy
men's
minds
similarly
occupied."
"Of
course
of
course,"
assented
Malone;
"but
never
mind
them."
And
he
whistled,
looked
impatiently
round,
and
seemed
to
feel
a
great
want
of
something.
