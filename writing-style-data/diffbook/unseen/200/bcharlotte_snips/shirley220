for
them."
"They'll
not
come;
it's
near
noon.
Better
give
it
up.
It
will
excite
bad
feeling
make
a
stir
cause
perhaps
fatal
consequences."
"You
need
not
appear,"
said
Moore.
"I
shall
meet
them
in
the
yard
when
they
come;
you
can
stay
here."
"But
my
name
must
be
seen
in
the
law
proceedings.
A
wife
and
family,
Mr.
Moore
a
wife
and
family
make
a
man
cautious."
Moore
looked
disgusted.
"Give
way,
if
you
please,"
said
he;
"leave
me
to
myself.
I
have
no
objection
to
act
alone;
only
be
assured
you
will
not
find
safety
in
submission.
Your
partner
Pearson
gave
way,
and
conceded,
and
forbore.
Well,
that
did
not
prevent
them
from
attempting
to
shoot
him
in
his
own
house."
"My
dear
sir,
take
a
little
wine
and
water,"
recommended
Mr.
Helstone.
The
wine
and
water
was
hollands
and
water,
as
Mr.
Sykes
discovered
when
he
had
compounded
and
swallowed
a
brimming
tumbler
thereof.
It
transfigured
him
in
two
minutes,
brought
the
colour
back
to
his
face,
and
made
him
at
least
word
valiant.
He
now
announced
that
he
hoped
he
was
above
being
trampled
on
by
the
common
people;
he
was
determined
to
endure
the
insolence
