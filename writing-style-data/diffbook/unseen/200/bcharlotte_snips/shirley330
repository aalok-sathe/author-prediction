herself
as
she
quitted
the
room.
A
week
or
two
passed;
her
bodily
and
mental
health
neither
grew
worse
nor
better.
She
was
now
precisely
in
that
state
when,
if
her
constitution
had
contained
the
seeds
of
consumption,
decline,
or
slow
fever,
those
diseases
would
have
been
rapidly
developed,
and
would
soon
have
carried
her
quietly
from
the
world.
People
never
die
of
love
or
grief
alone,
though
some
die
of
inherent
maladies
which
the
tortures
of
those
passions
prematurely
force
into
destructive
action.
The
sound
by
nature
undergo
these
tortures,
and
are
racked,
shaken,
shattered;
their
beauty
and
bloom
perish,
but
life
remains
untouched.
They
are
brought
to
a
certain
point
of
dilapidation;
they
are
reduced
to
pallor,
debility,
and
emaciation.
People
think,
as
they
see
them
gliding
languidly
about,
that
they
will
soon
withdraw
to
sick
beds,
perish
there,
and
cease
from
among
the
healthy
and
happy.
This
does
not
happen.
They
live
on;
and
though
they
cannot
regain
youth
and
gaiety,
they
may
regain
strength
and
serenity.
The
blossom
which
the
March
wind
nips,
but
fails
to
sweep
away,
may
survive
to
hang
a
withered
apple
on
the
tree
late
into
autumn:
having
braved
the
last
frosts
