allowance
of
beef
and
wine."
"That
will
do.
Where
is
your
sister?"
"Well
cared
for.
I
had
her
securely
domiciled
with
Miss
Mann.
This
very
morning
the
two
set
out
for
Wormwood
Wells
[a
noted
watering
place],
and
will
stay
there
some
weeks."
"So
Mr.
Helstone
domiciled
me
at
the
rectory!
Mighty
clever
you
gentlemen
think
you
are!
I
make
you
heartily
welcome
to
the
idea,
and
hope
its
savour,
as
you
chew
the
cud
of
reflection
upon
it,
gives
you
pleasure.
Acute
and
astute,
why
are
you
not
also
omniscient?
How
is
it
that
events
transpire,
under
your
very
noses,
of
which
you
have
no
suspicion?
It
should
be
so,
otherwise
the
exquisite
gratification
of
outmanoeuvring
you
would
be
unknown.
Ah,
friend,
you
may
search
my
countenance,
but
you
cannot
read
it."
Moore,
indeed,
looked
as
if
he
could
not.
"You
think
me
a
dangerous
specimen
of
my
sex.
Don't
you
now?"
"A
peculiar
one,
at
least."
"But
Caroline
is
she
peculiar?"
"In
her
way
yes."
"Her
way!
What
is
her
way?"
"You
know
her
as
well
as
I
do."
"And
knowing
her,
I
assert
that
she
is
neither
eccentric
nor
difficult
of
control.
Is
she?"
"That
depends
"
