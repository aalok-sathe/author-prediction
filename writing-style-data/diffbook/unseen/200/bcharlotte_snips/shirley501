fearlessly,
then,
on
daisy
and
turf,
and
through
thick
plantations;
she
reached
Fieldhead,
and
penetrated
to
Miss
Keeldar's
dressing
room.
It
was
well
she
had
come,
or
Shirley
would
have
been
too
late.
Instead
of
making
ready
with
all
speed,
she
lay
stretched
on
a
couch,
absorbed
in
reading.
Mrs.
Pryor
stood
near,
vainly
urging
her
to
rise
and
dress.
Caroline
wasted
no
words.
She
immediately
took
the
book
from
her,
and
with
her
own
hands
commenced
the
business
of
disrobing
and
rerobing
her.
Shirley,
indolent
with
the
heat,
and
gay
with
her
youth
and
pleasurable
nature,
wanted
to
talk,
laugh,
and
linger;
but
Caroline,
intent
on
being
in
time,
persevered
in
dressing
her
as
fast
as
fingers
could
fasten
strings
or
insert
pins.
At
length,
as
she
united
a
final
row
of
hooks
and
eyes,
she
found
leisure
to
chide
her,
saying
she
was
very
naughty
to
be
so
unpunctual,
that
she
looked
even
now
the
picture
of
incorrigible
carelessness;
and
so
Shirley
did,
but
a
very
lovely
picture
of
that
tiresome
quality.
She
presented
quite
a
contrast
to
Caroline.
There
was
style
in
every
fold
of
her
dress
and
every
line
of
her
figure.
The
rich
silk
