Rising,
he
went
to
the
window,
opened
it,
and
listened.
He
soon
closed
it.
"It
is
only
the
sound
of
the
wind
rising,"
he
remarked,
"and
the
rivulet
a
little
swollen,
rushing
down
the
hollow.
I
expected
those

night;
but
the
road
seemed
extremely
quiet
as
I
came
along.
I

"You

Redhouse?"
"Yes."
"There
