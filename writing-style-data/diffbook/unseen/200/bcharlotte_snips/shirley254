gentle
and
rattling;
exacting,
yet
generous;
fearless
of
her
mother,
for
instance,
whose
irrationally
hard
and
strict
rule
she
has
often
defied
yet
reliant
on
any
who
will
help
her.
Jessy,
with
her
little
piquant
face,
engaging
prattle,
and
winning
ways,
is
made
to
be
a
pet,
and
her
father's
pet
she
accordingly
is.
It
is
odd
that
the
doll
should
resemble
her
mother
feature
by
feature,
as
Rose
resembles
her
father,
and
yet
the
physiognomy
how
different!
Mr.
Yorke,
if
a
magic
mirror
were
now
held
before
you,
and
if
therein
were
shown
you
your
two
daughters
as
they
will
be
twenty

from
this
night,
what
would
you
think?
The
magic
mirror
is
here:
you
shall
learn
their
destinies
and
first
that
of
your
little
life,
Jessy.
Do
you
know
this
place?
No,
you
never
saw
it;
but
you
recognize
the
nature
of
these
trees,
this
foliage
the
cypress,
the
willow,
the
yew.
Stone
crosses
like
these
are
not
unfamiliar
to
you,
nor
are
these
dim
garlands
of
everlasting
flowers.
Here
is
the
place
green
sod
and
a
gray
marble
headstone.
Jessy
sleeps
below.
She
lived
through
an
April
day;
much
loved
was
she,
much
loving.
She
