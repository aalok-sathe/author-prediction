he
had
left
it
behind
him
in
the
joy
echoing
fields
round
the
school.
What
remained
now
was
his
dark,
quiet,
business
countenance.
As
Shirley
had
said,
a
certain
hardness
characterized
his
air,
while
his
eye
was
excited,
but
austere.
So
much
the
worse
timed
was
the
present
freak
of
Shirley's.
If
he
had
looked
disposed
for
holiday
mirth,
it
would
not
have
mattered
much;
but
now
"I
told
you
not
to
come,"
said
Caroline,
somewhat
bitterly,
to
her
friend.
She
seemed
truly
perturbed.
To
be
intruded
on
Robert
thus,
against
her
will
and
his
expectation,
and
when
he
evidently
would
rather
not
be
delayed,
keenly
annoyed
her.
It
did
not
annoy
Miss
Keeldar
in
the
least.
She
stepped
forward
and
faced
her
tenant,
barring
his
way.
"You
omitted
to
bid
us
good
bye,"
she
said.
"Omitted
to
bid
you
good
bye!
Where
did
you
come
from?
Are
you
fairies?
I
left
two
like
you,
one
in
purple
and
one
in
white,
standing
at
the
top
of
a
bank,
four
fields
off,
but
a
minute
ago."
"You
left
us
there
and
find
us
here.
We
have
been
watching
you,
and
shall
watch
you
still.
You
must
be
questioned
one
day,
