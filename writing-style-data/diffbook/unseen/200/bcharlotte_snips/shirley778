her.
She
spoke
it
quick,
quick
as
quick
as
Mr.
Moore
himself."
"Was
she
obedient?
Did
she
give
trouble?"
"She
gave
plenty
of
trouble,
in
a
way.
She
was
giddy,
but
I
liked
her.
I'm
desperately
fond
of
Shirley."
"Desperately
fond
you
small
simpleton!
You
don't
know
what
you
say."
"I
am
desperately
fond
of
her.
She
is
the
light
of
my
eyes.
I
said
so
to
Mr.
Moore
last
night."
"He
would
reprove
you
for
speaking
with
exaggeration."
"He
didn't.
He
never
reproves
and
reproves,
as
girls'
governesses
do.
He
was
reading,
and
he
only
smiled
into
his
book,
and
said
that
if
Miss
Keeldar
was
no
more
than
that,
she
was
less
than
he
took
her
to
be;
for
I
was
but
a
dim
eyed,
short
sighted
little
chap.
I'm
afraid
I
am
a
poor
unfortunate,
Miss
Caroline
Helstone.
I
am
a
cripple,
you
know."
"Never
mind,
Henry,
you
are
a
very
nice
little
fellow;
and
if
God
has
not
given
you
health
and
strength,
He
has
given
you
a
good
disposition
and
an
excellent
heart
and
brain."
"I
shall
be
despised.
I
sometimes
think
both
Shirley
and
you
despise
me."
"Listen,
Henry.
Generally,
I
don't
like
schoolboys.
