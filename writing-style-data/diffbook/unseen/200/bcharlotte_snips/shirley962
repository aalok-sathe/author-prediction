all,
notwithstanding
the
chops
and
jellies
he
gets,
I
would
not
be
in
his
shoes.
In
fact,
it
is
my
private
opinion
that
she
eats
most
of
what
goes
up
on
the
tray
to
Mr.
Moore.
I
wish
she
may
not
be
starving
him."
Profound
silence
and
meditation
on
Caroline's
part,
and
a
sly
watchfulness
on
Martin's.
"You
never
see
him,
I
suppose,
Martin?"
"I?
No.
I
don't
care

She

you
as
it
is
her
pleasure
to
treat
visitors
now
and
then.
She
behaved
to
you
rudely
and
harshly."
"She
was
not
kind;
for
you
know,
Martin,
we
are
relations,
and
it
is
natural
we
should
take
an
interest
in
Mr.
Moore.
But
here
we
must
part;
we
are
at
your
father's
gate."
"Very
well,
what

that?
I
shall
walk
home
with
you."
"They
will
miss
you,
and
