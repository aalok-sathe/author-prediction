It
war
only
a
bit
of
a
sum
in
practice,
that
our
Harry
would
have
settled
i'
two
minutes.
She
couldn't
do
it.
Mr.
Moore
had
to
show
her
how.
And
when
he
did
show
her,
she
couldn't
understand
him."
"Nonsense,
Joe!"
"Nay,
it's
no
nonsense.
And
Miss
Shirley
there
reckons
to
hearken
to
t'
maister
when
he's
talking
ower
trade,
so
attentive
like,
as
if
she
followed
him
word
for
word,
and
all
war
as
clear
as
a
lady's
looking
glass

her
een;

she's
peeping
and
peeping
out
o'
t'
window
to
see
if
t'
mare
stands
quiet;
and
then
looking
at
a
bit
of
a
splash
on
her
riding
skirt;
and
then
glancing
glegly
round
at
wer
counting
house
cobwebs
and
dust,
and
thinking
what
mucky
folk
we
are,
and
what
a
grand
ride
she'll
have
just
i'
now
ower
Nunnely
Common.
She
hears
no
more
o'
Mr.
Moore's
talk
nor
if
he
spake
Hebrew."
"Joe,
you
are
a
real
slanderer.
I
would
give
you
your
answer,
only
the
people
are
coming
out
of
church.
We
must
leave
you.
Man
of
prejudice,
good
bye.
William,
good
bye.
Children,
