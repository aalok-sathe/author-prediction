looking
at

constellations.
How
closely
she
glided
against
the
banisters!
How
shyly
shone
her
large
eyes
upon
me!
How
evanescent,
fugitive,
fitful
she
looked
slim
and
swift
as
a
northern
streamer!
"I
followed
her
into
the
drawing
room.
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Caroline
Helstone
were
both

looked
at
her.
She
was
very
silent;
I
think
she
never
