out
of

read
these
parts
for
him.
From
her
he
seemed
to
enjoy
them,
and
indeed
she
gave
them
with
a
spirit
no
one
could
have
expected
of
her,
with
a
pithy
expression
with
which
she
seemed
gifted
on
the
spot,
and
for
that
brief
moment
only.
It
may
be
remarked,
in
passing,
that
the
general
character
of
her
conversation
that
evening,
whether
serious
or
sprightly,
grave

something
untaught,
unstudied,

the
flow
of
a
rivulet.

vision
of
the
banished
man
Moore's
spirit
seemed
to
pause.
He
stood
on
the
hearth
of
Aufidius's
hall,
facing
the
image
of
greatness
fallen,
but
greater
than
ever
in
that
low
estate.
He
saw
"the
grim
appearance,"
the
dark
face
"bearing
command
in
it,"
"the
noble
vessel
with
its
tackle
torn."
With
the
revenge
