seat
at
the
little
parlour
window.
From
no
point
of
view
could
the
west
look
so
lovely
as
from
that
lattice
with
the
garland
of
jessamine
round
it,
whose
white
stars
and
green
leaves
seemed
now
but
gray
pencil
outlines
graceful
in
form,
but
colourless
in
tint
against
the
gold
incarnadined
of
a
summer
evening
against
the
fire

Caroline
looked
at
the
wicket

at
last
saw
nay,

Frederick
Murgatroyd
went
by,
carrying
a
pail
of
water;
Joe
Scott
followed,
dangling
on
his
forefinger
the
keys
of
the
mill.
They
were
going
to
lock
up
mill
and
stables
for

"So
