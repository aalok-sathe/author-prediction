England,
if
not
weary,
was
worn
with
long
resistance
yes,
and
half
her
people
were
weary
too,
and
cried
out
for
peace
on
any
terms.
National
honour
was
become
a
mere
empty
name,
of
no
value
in
the
eyes
of
many,
because
their
sight
was
dim
with
famine;
and
for
a
morsel
of
meat
they
would
have
sold
their
birthright.
The
"Orders
in
Council,"
provoked
by
Napoleon's
Milan
and
Berlin
decrees,
and
forbidding
neutral
powers
to
trade
with
France,
had,
by
offending
America,
cut
off
the
principal
market
of
the
Yorkshire
woollen
trade,
and
brought
it
consequently
to
the
verge
of
ruin.
Minor
foreign
markets
were
glutted,
and
would
receive
no
more.
The
Brazils,
Portugal,
Sicily,
were
all
overstocked
by
nearly
two
years'
consumption.
At
this
crisis
certain
inventions
in
machinery
were
introduced
into
the
staple
manufactures
of
the
north,
which,
greatly
reducing
the
number
of
hands
necessary
to
be
employed,
threw
thousands
out
of
work,
and
left
them
without
legitimate
means
of
sustaining
life.
A
bad
harvest
supervened.
Distress
reached
its
climax.
Endurance,
overgoaded,
stretched
the
hand
of
fraternity
to
sedition.
The
throes
of
a
sort
of
moral
earthquake
were
felt
heaving
under
the
hills
of
the
northern
