you
will
not
be
repulsive."
"Miss
Mann
did
not
make
herself,
or
tune
her
voice,
Robert."
"Nature
made
her
in
the
mood
in
which
she
makes
her
briars
and
thorns;
whereas
for
the
creation
of
some
women
she
reserves
the
May
morning
hours,
when
with
light
and
dew
she
wooes
the
primrose
from
the
turf

little
parlour,
Caroline
found
her,
as
she
always

in
the
grate.
She
herself
sat
primly
and
somewhat
grimly
tidy
in
a
cushioned
rocking
chair,
her
hands
busied
with
some
knitting.
This
was
her
favourite
work,
as
it
required
the
least
exertion.
She
scarcely
rose
as
Caroline
entered.
To
avoid
excitement
was
one
of
Miss
Mann's
aims
in
life.
She
had
been
composing
herself
ever
since
she
came
down
in
the
morning,
and

tranquillity
