all
others
he
showed
himself
obstinately
insensible.
Shirley
advanced
to
meet
Messrs.
Hall
and
Sweeting,
shaking
hands
with
them
cordially.
They
were
come
to
tell
her
of
certain
successes
they
had
achieved
that
morning
in
applications
for
subscriptions
to
the
fund.
Mr.
Hall's
eyes
beamed
benignantly
through
his
spectacles,
his
plain
face
looked
positively
handsome
with
goodness;
and
when
Caroline,
seeing
who
was
come,
ran
out
to
meet
him,
and
put
both
her
hands
into
his,
he
gazed
down
on
her
with
a
gentle,
serene,
affectionate
expression
that
gave
him
the
aspect
of
a
smiling
Melanchthon.
Instead
of
re
entering
the
house,
they
strayed
through
the
garden,
the
ladies
walking
one
on
each
side
of
Mr.
Hall.
It
was
a
breezy
sunny
day;
the
air
freshened
the
girls'
cheeks
and
gracefully
dishevelled
their
ringlets.
Both
of
them
looked
pretty
one
gay.
Mr.
Hall
spoke
oftenest
to
his
brilliant
companion,
looked
most
frequently
at
the
quiet
one.
Miss
Keeldar
gathered
handfuls
of
the
profusely
blooming
flowers
whose
perfume
filled
the
enclosure.
She
gave
some
to
Caroline,
telling
her
to
choose
a
nosegay
for
Mr.
Hall;
and
with
her
lap
filled
with
delicate
and
splendid
blossoms,
Caroline
sat
down
on
the
steps
