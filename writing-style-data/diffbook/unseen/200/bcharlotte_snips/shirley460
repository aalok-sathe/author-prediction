to
come
and
take
the
seat
next
her
in
a
party,
and
thus
secure
her
from
Peter
Augustus
Malone,
Joseph
Donne,
or
John
Sykes;
and
Mr.
Hall
never
failed
to
avail
himself
of
this
privilege
when
he
possibly
could.
Such
preference
shown
by
a
single
gentleman
to
a
single
lady
would
certainly,
in
ordinary
cases,
have
set
in
motion
the
tongues
of
the
gossips;
but
Cyril
Hall
was
forty
five
years
old,
slightly
bald,
and
slightly
gray,
and
nobody
ever
said
or
thought
he
was
likely
to
be
married
to
Miss
Helstone.
Nor
did
he
think
so
himself.
He
was
wedded
already
to
his
books
and
his
parish.
His
kind
sister
Margaret,
spectacled
and
learned
like
himself,
made
him
happy
in
his
single
state;
he
considered
it
too
late
to
change.
Besides,
he
had
known
Caroline
as
a
pretty
little
girl.
She
had
sat
on
his
knee
many
a
time;
he
had
bought
her
toys
and
given
her
books;
he
felt
that
her
friendship
for
him
was
mixed
with
a
sort
of
filial
respect;
he
could
not
have
brought
himself
to
attempt
to
give
another
colour
to
her
sentiments,
and
his
serene
mind
could
glass
a
fair
image
without
feeling
