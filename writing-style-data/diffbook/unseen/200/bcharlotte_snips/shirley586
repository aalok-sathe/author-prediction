operative
class.
It
is
difficult
to
be
tolerant,
difficult
to
be
just,
in
such
moments.
Caroline
rose;
Shirley
put
her
arm
round
her:
they
stood
together
as
still
as
the
straight
stems
of
two
trees.
That
yell
was
a
long
one,
and
when
it
ceased
the
night
was
yet
full
of
the
swaying
and
murmuring
of
a
crowd.
"What
next?"
was
the
question
of
the
listeners.
Nothing
came
yet.
The
mill
remained
mute
as
a
mausoleum.
"He
cannot
be
alone!"
whispered
Caroline.
"I
would
stake
all
I
have
that

is
as

responded
Shirley.
Shots

the
rioters.
Had

The
hitherto

flashed
from
its
empty
window

a
volley
of
musketry
pealed
sharp
through
the
Hollow.
"Moore
speaks
at
last!"
said
Shirley,
"and
he
seems
to
have
the
gift
of
tongues.
That
was
not
a
single
voice."
"He
has
been
forbearing.
No
one
can
accuse
him
of
rashness,"
alleged
Caroline.
"Their
discharge
preceded
his.
They
broke
his
gates
and
his
windows.
They
fired
at
his
garrison
before
he
repelled
them."
What
was
going
on
now?
It
seemed
