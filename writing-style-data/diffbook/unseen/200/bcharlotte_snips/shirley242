said
to
them
a
few
brief
but
very
earnest
words
of
religious
consolation
and
exhortation.
With
a
mutual
"God
bless
you,
sir!"
"God
bless
you,
my
friends!"
they
separated.
Messrs.
Helstone
and
Sykes
began
to
be
extremely
jocose
and
congratulatory
with
Mr.
Moore
when
he
returned
to
them
after
dismissing
the
deputation.
He
was
so
quiet,
however,
under
their
compliments
upon
his
firmness,
etc.,
and
wore
a
countenance
so
like
a
still,
dark
day,
equally
beamless
and
breezeless,
that
the
rector,
after
glancing
shrewdly
into
his
eyes,
buttoned
up
his
felicitations
with
his
coat,
and
said
to
Sykes,
whose
senses
were
not
acute
enough
to
enable
him
to
discover
unassisted
where
his
presence
and
conversation
were
a
nuisance,
"Come,
sir;
your
road
and
mine
lie
partly
together.
Had
we
not
better
bear
each
other
company?
We'll
bid
Moore
good
morning,
and
leave
him
to
the
happy
fancies
he
seems
disposed
to
indulge."
"And
where
is
Sugden?"
demanded
Moore,
looking
up.
"Ah,
ha!"
cried
Helstone.
"I've
not
been
quite
idle
while
you
were
busy.
I've
been
helping
you
a
little;
I
flatter
myself
not
injudiciously.
I
thought
it
better
not
to
lose
time;
so,
while
you
were
parleying
with
that
