the
thickening
white
storm
waxed
bewildering;
but
on
she
came,
and
not
dismayed.
"Well,
Martin,"
she
said
eagerly,
"how
is
he?"
"It
is
queer
how
she
thinks
of
him,"
reflected
Martin.
"The
blinding
snow
and
bitter
cold
are
nothing
to
her,
I
believe;
yet
she
is
but
a
'chitty
faced
creature,'
as
my
mother
would
say.
I
could
find
in
my
heart
to
wish
I
had
a
cloak
to
wrap
her
in."
Thus
meditating
to
himself,
he
neglected
to
answer
Miss
Helstone.
"You
have
seen
him?"
"No."
"Oh!
you
promised
you
would."
"I
mean
to
do
better
by
you
than
that.
Didn't
I
say
I
don't
care
to
see
him?"
"But
now
it
will
be
so
long
before
I
get
to
know
any
thing
certain
about
him,
and
I
am
sick
of
waiting.
Martin,
do
see
him,
and
give
him
Caroline
Helstone's
regards,
and
say
she
wished
to
know
how
he
was,
and
if
anything
could
be
done
for
his
comfort."
"I
won't."
"You
are
changed.
You
were
so
friendly
last
night."
"Come,
we
must
not
stand
in
this
wood;
it
is
too
cold."
"But
before
I
go
promise
me
to
come
again
to
morrow
with
news."
"No
such
thing.
