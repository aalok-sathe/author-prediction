why
do
you
not
bear
me
company?
I
only
weep
tears,
delightful
and
soon
wiped
away;
you
might
weep
gall,
if
you
choose."
"Why
should
I
weep
gall?"
"Mateless,
solitary
bird!"
was
the
only
answer.
"And
are
not
you
too
mateless,
Shirley?"
"At

no."
"Oh!
who
nestles
there,
Shirley?"
But
Shirley
only
laughed
gaily
at
this
question,
and
alertly
started
up.
"I

she
said,
"a
mere

Miss
Helstone
was
by
this

which
still
frequently
drew
her
of
an
evening
to
the
field
style
and
the
old
thorn
overlooking
the
Hollow.
One
night,
the
night
after
the
incident
of
the
note,
she
had
been
at
her
usual
post,
watching
for
her
beacon

that
evening
no
lamp
was

She
waited
till

In
