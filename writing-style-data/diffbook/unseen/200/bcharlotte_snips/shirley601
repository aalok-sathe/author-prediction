the
news
of
what
had
happened
at
the
Hollow
was
spread
all
over
the
neighbourhood.
Fanny,
who
had
been
to
Fieldhead
to
fetch
the
milk,
returned
in
panting
haste
with
tidings
that
there
had
been
a
battle
in
the
night
at
Mr.
Moore's
mill,
and
that
some
said
twenty
men
were
killed.
Eliza,
during
Fanny's
absence,
had
been
apprised
by
the
butcher's
boy
that
the
mill
was
burnt
to
the
ground.
Both
women
rushed
into
the
parlour
to
announce
these
terrible
facts
to
the
ladies,
terminating
their
clear
and
accurate
narrative
by
the
assertion
that
they
were
sure
master
must
have
been
in
it
all.
He
and
Thomas,
the
clerk,
they
were
confident,
must
have
gone
last
night
to
join
Mr.
Moore
and
the
soldiers.
Mr.
Malone,
too,
had
not
been
heard
of
at
his
lodgings
since
yesterday
afternoon;
and
Joe
Scott's
wife
and
family
were
in
the
greatest
distress,
wondering
what
had
become
of
their
head.
Scarcely
was
this
information
imparted
when
a
knock
at
the
kitchen
door
announced
the
Fieldhead
errand
boy,
arrived
in
hot
haste,
bearing
a
billet
from
Mrs.
Pryor.
It
was
hurriedly
written,
and
urged
Miss
Keeldar
to
return
directly,
as
the
neighbourhood
and
the
