people
at
church,
and
when
especially
certain
ladies
were
absent,
of
whose
observant
faculties
and
tomahawk
tongues
Caroline
stood
in
awe,
she
had
allowed
her
eye
to
seek
Robert's
pew,
and
to
rest
awhile
on
its
occupant.
He
was
there
alone.
Hortense
had
been
kept
at
home
by
prudent
considerations
relative
to
the
rain
and
a
new
spring
chapeau.
During
the
sermon
he
sat
with
folded
arms
and
eyes
cast
down,
looking
very
sad
and
abstracted.
When
depressed,
the
very
hue
of
his
face
seemed
more
dusk
than
when
he
smiled,
and
to
day
cheek
and
forehead
wore
their
most
tintless

sober
olive.
By
instinct
Caroline
knew,
as
she
examined
that
clouded
countenance,
that
his
thoughts
were
running
in
no
familiar
or
kindly
channel;
that
they
were
far
away,
not
merely
from
her,
but
from
all
which
she
could
comprehend,
or
in
which
she
could
sympathize.
Nothing
that
they
had
ever
talked
of
together
was
now
in
his
mind:
he
was
wrapt
from
her
by
interests
and
responsibilities
in
which
it
was
deemed
such
as
she
could
have
no
part.
Caroline
meditated
in
her
own
way
on
the
subject;
speculated
on
his
feelings,
on
his
life,
on
his
fears,
