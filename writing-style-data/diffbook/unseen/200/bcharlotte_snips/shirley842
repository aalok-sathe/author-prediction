Sympson,
go
on,
when
I
tell
you."
"'Because,'
she
said,
'if
I
made
no
will,
and
died
before
you,
Harry,
all
my
property
would
go
to
you;
and
I
do
not
intend
that
it
should
be
so,
though
your
father
would
like
it.
But
you,'
she
said,
'will
have
his
whole
estate,
which
is
large
larger
than
Fieldhead.
Your
sisters
will
have
nothing;
so
I
have
left
them
some
money,
though
I
do
not
love
them,
both
together,
half
so
much
as
I
love
one
lock
of
your
fair
hair.'
She
said
these
words,
and
she
called
me
her
'darling,'
and
let
me
kiss
her.
She
went
on
to
tell
me
that
she
had
left
Caroline
Helstone
some
money
too;
that
this
manor
house,
with
its
furniture
and
books,
she
had
bequeathed
to
me,
as
she
did
not
choose
to
take
the
old
family
place
from
her
own
blood;
and
that
all
the
rest
of
her
property,
amounting
to
about
twelve
thousand
pounds,
exclusive
of
the
legacies
to
my
sisters
and
Miss
Helstone,
she
had
willed,
not
to
me,
seeing
I
was
already
rich,
but
to
a
good
man,
who
would
make
the
best
use
of
it
that
any
human
