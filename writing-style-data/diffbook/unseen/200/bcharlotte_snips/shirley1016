I
triumphed
over
her
mercilessly."
"What
right
had
you
to
triumph?
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
fancy
free?"
"Whatever
I
am,
Shirley
is
a
bondswoman.
Lioness,
she
has
found
her
captor.
Mistress
she
may
be
of
all
round
her,
but
her
own
mistress
she
is
not."
"So
you
exulted
at
recognizing
a
fellow
slave
in
one
so
fair
and
imperial?"
"I
did;
Robert,
you
say
right,
in
one
so
fair
and
imperial."
"You
confess
it
a
fellow
slave?"
"I
confess
nothing;
but
I
say
that
haughty
Shirley
is
no
more
free
than
was
Hagar."
"And
who,
pray,
is
the
Abraham,
the
hero
of
a
patriarch
who
has
achieved
such
a
conquest?"
"You
still
speak
scornfully,
and
cynically,
and
sorely;
but
I
will
make
you
change
your
note
before
I
have
done
with
you."
"We
will
see
that.
Can
she
marry
this
Cupidon?"
"Cupidon!
he
is
just
about
as
much
a
Cupidon
as
you
are
a
Cyclops."
"Can
she
marry
him?"
"You
will
see."
"I
want
to
know
his
name,
Cary."
"Guess
it."
"Is
it
any
one
in
this
neighbourhood?"
"Yes,
in
Briarfield
parish."
"Then
it
is
some
person
unworthy
of
her.
I
don't
know
a
soul
in
Briarfield
