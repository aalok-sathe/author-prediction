break
till
you
are
gone."
"Martin,
I
trust
you."
"You
never
said
a
better
word.
Let
me
take
your
shawl.
I
will
shake
off
the
snow
and
dry
it
for
you.
You
are
cold
and
wet.
Never
mind;
there
is
a
fire
upstairs.
Are
you
ready?"
"Yes."
"Follow
me."
He
left
his
shoes
on
the
mat,

head
in
soap
suds
in
the
back
kitchen,
so
I
asked
her
to
step
up."
"Up
here,
sir?"
"Up
here,
sir;
but
if
you
object,
she
shall
go
down
again."
"Is
this
