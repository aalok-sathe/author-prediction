circle
about
him
for
the
children
had
come
round
his
knee,
and
the
father
and
mother
stood
before
him
he
said
abruptly,
"And
how
are
you
all?
How
do
you
get
on?"
Mr.
Hall,
be
it
remarked,
though
an
accomplished
scholar,
not
only
spoke
with
a
strong
northern
accent,
but,
on
occasion,
used
freely
north
country
expressions.
"We
get
on
poorly,"
said
William;
"we're
all
out
of
work.
I've
selled
most
o'
t'
household
stuff,
as
ye
may
see;
and
what
we're
to
do
next,
God
knows."
"Has
Mr.
Moore
turned
you
off?"
"He
has
turned
us

and
I've
sich
an
opinion
of
him
now
that
I
think
if
he'd
tak
me
on

to
morrow
I
wouldn't
work
for
him."
"It
is
not

you
to
say
so,
William."
"I
know
it
isn't;
but
I'm
getting
different
to
mysel';
I
feel
I
am
changing.
I
wadn't
heed
if
t'
bairns
and
t'
wife
had
enough
to
live
on;
but
they're
pinched
they're
pined
"
"Well,
my
lad,
and
so
are
you;
I
see
you
are.
These
are
grievous
times;
I
see
suffering
wherever
I
turn.
William,
sit
down.
Grace,
sit
down.
Let
us
talk
it
over."
