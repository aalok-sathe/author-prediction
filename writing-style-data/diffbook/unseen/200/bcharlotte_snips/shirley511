Boultby,
in
short,
was
in
his
glory,
and
in
a
round,
sound
voix
de
poitrine
he
rumbled
out
thanks
for
attentions
and
assurances
of
his
tolerable
health.
Of
Caroline
he
took
no
manner
of
notice
as
she
came
near,
save
to
accept
what
she
offered.
He
did
not
see
her
he
never
did
see
her;
he
hardly
knew
that
such
a
person
existed.
He
saw
the
macaroons,
however,
and
being
fond
of
sweets,
possessed
himself
of
a
small
handful
thereof.
The
wine
Mrs.
Boultby
insisted
on
mingling
with
hot
water,
and
qualifying
with
sugar
and
nutmeg.
Mr.
Hall
stood
near
an
open
window,
breathing
the
fresh
air
and
scent
of
flowers,
and
talking
like
a
brother
to
Miss
Ainley.
To
him
Caroline
turned
her
attention
with
pleasure.
"What
should
she
bring
him?
He
must
not
help
himself
he
must
be
served
by
her."
And
she
provided
herself
with
a
little
salver,
that
she
might
offer
him
variety.
Margaret
Hall
joined
them;
so
did
Miss
Keeldar.
The
four
ladies
stood
round
their
favourite
pastor.
They
also
had
an
idea
that
they
looked
on
the
face
of
an
earthly
angel.
Cyril
Hall
was
their
pope,
