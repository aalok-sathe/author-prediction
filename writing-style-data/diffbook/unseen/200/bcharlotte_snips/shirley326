He
would
have
shown
some
token
of
affection.
In
his
eye,
on
his
lips,
I
should
have
read
comfort;
but
the
chance
is
lost.
The
wind,
the
cloud's
shadow,
does
not
pass
more
silently,
more
emptily
than
he.
I
have
been
mocked,
and
Heaven
is
cruel!"
Thus,
in
the
utter
sickness
of
longing
and
disappointment,
she
went
home.
The
next
morning
at
breakfast,
where
she
appeared
white
cheeked
and
miserable
looking
as
one
who
had
seen
a
ghost,
she
inquired
of
Mr.
Helstone,
"Have
you
any
objection,
uncle,
to
my
inquiring
for
a
situation
in
a
family?"
Her
uncle,
ignorant
as
the
table
supporting
his
coffee
cup
of
all
his
niece
had
undergone
and
was
undergoing,
scarcely
believed
his
ears.
"What
whim
now?"
he
asked.
"Are
you
bewitched?
What
can
you
mean?"
"I
am
not
well,
and
need
a
change,"
she
said.
He
examined
her.
He
discovered
she
had
experienced
a
change,
at
any
rate.
Without
his
being
aware
of
it,
the
rose
had
dwindled
and
faded
to
a
mere
snowdrop;
bloom
had
vanished,
flesh
wasted;
she
sat
before
him
drooping,
colourless,
and
thin.
But
for
the
soft
expression
of
her
brown
eyes,
the
delicate
lines
of
her
features,
and
