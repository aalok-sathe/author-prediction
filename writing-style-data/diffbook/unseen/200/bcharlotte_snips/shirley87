hardly
under
the
sod
when
rumours
began
to
be
rife
in
the
neighbourhood
that
she
had
died
of
a
broken
heart.
These
magnified
quickly
into
reports
of
hard
usage,
and,
finally,
details
of
harsh
treatment
on
the
part
of
her
husband
reports
grossly
untrue,
but
not
the
less
eagerly
received
on
that
account.
Mr.
Yorke
heard
them,
partly
believed
them.
Already,
of
course,
he
had
no
friendly
feeling
to
his
successful
rival.
Though
himself
a
married
man
now,
and
united
to
a
woman
who
seemed
a
complete
contrast
to
Mary
Cave
in
all
respects,
he
could
not
forget
the
great
disappointment
of
his
life;
and
when
he
heard
that
what
would
have
been
so
precious
to
him
had
been
neglected,
perhaps
abused,
by
another,
he
conceived
for
that
other
a
rooted
and
bitter
animosity.
Of
the
nature
and
strength
of
this
animosity
Mr.
Helstone
was
but
half
aware.
He
neither
knew
how
much
Yorke
had
loved
Mary
Cave,
what
he
had
felt
on
losing
her,
nor
was
he
conscious
of
the
calumnies
concerning
his
treatment
of
her,
familiar
to
every
ear
in
the
neighbourhood
but
his
own.
He
believed
political
and
religious
differences
alone
separated
him
and
Mr.
Yorke.
