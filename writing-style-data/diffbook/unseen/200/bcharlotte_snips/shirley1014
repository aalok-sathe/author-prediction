Cary?
Shall
we
not
despise
him
in
our
heart
gentle
but
just,
compassionate
but
upright?"
"Never!
We
will
remember
that
with
what
measure
we
mete
it
shall
be
measured
unto
us,
and
so
we
will
give
no
scorn,
only
affection."
"Which
won't
satisfy,
I
warn
you
of
that.
Something
besides
affection
something
far
stronger,
sweeter,
warmer
will
be
demanded
one
day.
Is
it
there
to
give?"
Caroline
was
moved,
much
moved.
"Be
calm,
Lina,"
said
Moore
soothingly.
"I
have
no
intention,
because
I
have
no
right,
to
perturb
your
mind
now,
nor
for
months
to
come.
Don't
look
as
if
you
would
leave
me.
We
will
make
no
more
agitating
allusions;
we
will
resume
our
gossip.
Do
not
tremble;
look
me
in
the
face.
See
what
a
poor,
pale,
grim
phantom
I
am
more
pitiable
than
formidable."
She
looked
shyly.
"There
is
something
formidable
still,
pale
as
you
are,"
she
said,
as
her
eye
fell
under
his.
"To
return
to
Shirley,"
pursued
Moore:
"is
it
your
opinion
that
she
is
ever
likely
to
marry?"
"She
loves."
"Platonically
theoretically
all
humbug!"
"She
loves
what
I
call
sincerely."
"Did
she
say
so?"
"I
cannot
affirm
that
she
said
so.
No
such
confession
