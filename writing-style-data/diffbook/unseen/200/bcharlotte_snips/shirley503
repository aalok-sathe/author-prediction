walking
as
became
a
beneficed
priest,
under
the
canopy
of
a
shovel
hat,
with
the
dignity
of
an
ample
corporation,
the
embellishment
of
the
squarest
and
vastest
of
black
coats,
and
the
support
of
the
stoutest
of
gold
headed
canes.
As
the
doctor
walked,
he
now
and
then
slightly
flourished
his
cane,
and
inclined
his
shovel
hat
with
a
dogmatical
wag
towards
his
aide
de
camp.
That
aide

camp
Donne,
to
wit
narrow

of
his
shape
was,
compared
to
the
broad
bulk
of
his
principal,
contrived,
notwithstanding,
to
look
every
inch

All
about
him

elevated
chin

his
clerical
black
gaiters,
his
somewhat
short,
strapless
trousers,
and
his
square
toed
shoes.
Walk
on,
Mr.
Donne!
You
have
undergone
scrutiny.
You
think
you
look
well.
Whether
the
white
and
purple
figures
watching
you
from
yonder
hill
think
so
is
another
question.
These
figures
come
running
down
when
the
regiment
has
marched
by.
The
churchyard
is
full
of
children
and
teachers,
all
in
their
very
best
holiday
attire;
and,
distressed
as
is
the
district,
bad
as
are
the
times,
it
is
wonderful
to
see
