built
ere
that
highway
was
cut,
and
when
a
lane
winding
up
through
fields
was
the
only
path
conducting
to
it.
Briarfield
lay
scarce
a
mile
off;
its
hum
was
heard,
its
glare
distinctly
seen.
Briar
Chapel,
a
large,
new,
raw
Wesleyan
place
of
worship,
rose
but
a
hundred
yards
distant;
and
as
there
was
even

travail
and
pain,
This
trembling
and
strife?
Plague,
earthquake,
and
famine,
And
tumult
and

The
wonderful
coming
Of
Jesus

"For
every
fight

The
warrior's
delight

shall
expire:
