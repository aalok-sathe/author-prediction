tyranny,
when
my
tongue
faltered,
and
I
have
almost
let
the
mantle
drop,
and
stood
in
her
presence,
not
master
no
but
something
else.
I
trust
I
shall
never
so
play
the
fool.
It
is
well
for
a
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
to
redden
when
he
meets
her
eye.
He
may
permit
himself
the
indulgence
of
submission.
He
may

underwent
that
test.
Her
farmer
or
her
footman
I
am
not
no
serf
nor
servant

I
ever
been;
but
I
am
poor,
and
it
behoves
me
to
look
to
my
self
respect
not
to
compromise
an
inch
of
it.
What
did
she
mean
by
that
allusion
to
the
cold
