I
do
when
Robert
is
taken
quite
from
me?
Where
shall
I
turn?
My
Robert!
I
wish
I
could
justly
call
him
mine.
But
I
am
poverty
and
incapacity;
Shirley
is
wealth
and
power.
And
she
is
beauty
too,
and
love.
I
cannot
deny
it.
This
is
no
sordid
suit.
She
loves
him
not
with
inferior
feelings.
She
loves,
or
will
love,
as
he
must
feel
proud
to
be
loved.
Not
a
valid
objection
can
be
made.
Let
them
be
married,
then.
But
afterwards
I
shall
be
nothing
to
him.
As
for
being
his
sister,
and
all
that
stuff,
I
despise
it.
I
will
either
be
all
or
nothing
to
a
man
like
Robert;
no
feeble
shuffling
or
false
cant
is
endurable.
Once
let
that
pair
be
united,
and
I
will
certainly
leave
them.
As
for
lingering
about,
playing
the
hypocrite,
and
pretending
to
calm
sentiments
of
friendship,
when
my
soul
will
be
wrung
with
other
feelings,
I
shall
not
descend
to
such
degradation.
As
little
could
I
fill
the
place
of
their
mutual
friend
as
that
of
their
deadly
foe;
as
little
could
I
stand
between
them
as
trample
over
them.
Robert
is
a
first
rate
man
in
my
