the
shams.
And,
mamma,
when
you
get
the
new
one,
mind
you
must
wear
it."
"My
dear,
I
thought
of
the
black
silk
serving
me
as
a
best
dress
for
many
years
yet,
and
I
wished
to
buy
you
several
things."
"Nonsense,
mamma.
My
uncle

And
then
you

like
a
young
lady,
with
such
a
clear,
fine
tone,
and
you
sing
better
than
any
young
lady
I
ever
heard.
Why
do
you
wear
such
dresses
and
bonnets,
mamma,
such
as
nobody
else
