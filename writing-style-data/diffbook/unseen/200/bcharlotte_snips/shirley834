in
that
of
none
except
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Caroline
Helstone.
She
was
civil,
kind,
attentive
even
to
her
cousins;
but
still
she
usually
had
little
to
say
to
them.
In
the
sunny
mood
of
this
particular
morning,
she
contrived
to
entertain
even
the
Misses
Sympson.
Without
deviating
from
her
wonted
rule
of
discussing
with
them
only
ordinary
themes,
she
imparted

fervour
laughed
in
her
gray
English
eye.
Some
directions
necessary
to
be
given
to
her
foreman,
John,
delayed
her
behind
her
cousins
as
they
neared
Fieldhead
on
their
return.
Perhaps
an
interval
of
twenty
minutes
elapsed
between
her
separation
from
them
and
her
re

into
the
house.
In
the
meantime
she

spoken
to
John,
