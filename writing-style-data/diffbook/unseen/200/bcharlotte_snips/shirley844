her
voice,
and
recall
her
look,
my
heart
beats
as
if
it
would
break
its
strings.
She
may
go
to
heaven
before
me
if
God
commands
it,
she
must;
but
the
rest
of
my
life
and
my
life
will
not
be
long,
I
am
glad
of
that
now
shall
be
a
straight,
quick,
thoughtful
journey
in
the
path
her
step
has
pressed.
I
thought
to
enter
the
vault
of
the
Keeldars
before
her.
Should
it
be
otherwise,
lay
my
coffin
by
Shirley's
side."
Moore
answered
him
with
a
weighty
calm,
that
offered
a
strange
contrast
to
the
boy's
perturbed
enthusiasm.
"You
are
wrong,
both
of
you
you
harm
each
other.
If
youth
once
falls
under
the
influence
of
a
shadowy
terror,
it
imagines
there
will
never
be
full
sunlight
again;
its
first
calamity
it
fancies
will
last
a
lifetime.
What
more
did
she
say?
Anything
more?"
"We
settled
one
or
two
family
points
between
ourselves."
"I
should
rather
like
to
know
what
"
"But,
Mr.
Moore,
you
smile.
I
could
not
smile
to
see
Shirley
in
such
a
mood."
"My
boy,
I
am
neither
nervous,
nor
poetic,
nor
inexperienced.
I
see
things
as
they
are;
you
don't
as
yet.
