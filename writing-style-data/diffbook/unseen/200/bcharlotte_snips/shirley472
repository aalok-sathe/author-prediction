a
lamb.
For
the
sake
of
air,
as
it
appeared,
or
perhaps
for
that
of
ready
exit
in
case
of
some
new
emergency
arising,
he
took
his
seat,
not
on
the
sofa,
where
Miss
Keeldar
offered
him
enthronization,
nor
yet
near
the
fireside,
to
which
Caroline,
by
a
friendly
sign,
gently
invited
him,
but
on
a
chair
close

the
door.
Being

he
grew,
after

This
was
to
be
the
graceful
toy
with
which
his
unoccupied
hands
were
to
trifle.
He
went
to
work
with
a
certain
energy.
He
folded
the
red
and
yellow
square
cornerwise;
he
whipped
it
open
with
a
waft;
again
he
folded
it
in
narrower
compass;
he
made
of
it
a
handsome
band.
To
what
purpose
would
he
proceed
to
apply
the
ligature?
