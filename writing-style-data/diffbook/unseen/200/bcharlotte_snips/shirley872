of
that
ruined
sanctuary
of
theirs,
mouldering
in
the
core
of
the
wood.
Louis
Moore
longs
to
have
something
near
him
to
night;
but
not
the
boy
baronet,
nor
his
benevolent
but
stern
mother,
nor
his
patrician
sisters,
nor
one
soul
of
the
Sympsons.
This
night
is
not
calm;
the
equinox
still
struggles
in
its
storms.
The
wild
rains
of
the
day

the
mountains;
and

is
well,
for
to

she
welcomes
eaolus.
Moore,

in
the
schoolroom,
heard
the
storm
roar
round
the
other
gable
and
along
the
hall
front.
This
end
was
sheltered.
He
wanted
no
shelter;
he
desired
no
subdued
sounds
or
screened
position.
"All
the
parlours
are
empty,"
said
he.
"I
am
sick
at
heart
of
this
cell."
He
left
it,
and
went
where

casements,
