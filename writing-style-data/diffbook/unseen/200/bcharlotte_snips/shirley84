ready
tongue,
chiefly
seemed
to
attract
him.
He
never,
however,
proposed
to
any
of
these
brilliant
belles
whose
society
he
sought;
and
all
at
once
he
seriously
fell
in
love
with
and
eagerly
wooed
a
girl
who
presented
a
complete
contrast
to
those
he
had
hitherto
noticed
a
girl
with
the
face
of
a
Madonna;
a
girl
of
living
marble
stillness
personified.
No
matter
that,
when
he
spoke
to
her,
she
only
answered
him
in
monosyllables;
no
matter
that
his
sighs
seemed
unheard,
that
his
glances
were
unreturned,
that
she
never
responded
to
his
opinions,
rarely
smiled
at
his
jests,
paid
him
no
respect
and
no
attention;
no
matter
that
she
seemed
the
opposite
of
everything
feminine
he
had
ever
in
his
whole
life
been
known
to
admire.
For
him
Mary
Cave
was
perfect,
because
somehow,
for
some
reason
no
doubt
he
had
a
reason
he
loved
her.
Mr.
Helstone,
at
that
time
curate
of
Briarfield,
loved
Mary
too
or,
at
any
rate,
he
fancied
her.
Several
others
admired
her,
for
she
was
beautiful
as
a
monumental
angel;
but
the
clergyman
was
preferred
for
his
office's
sake
that
office
probably
investing
him
with
some
of
the
illusion
necessary
to
allure
