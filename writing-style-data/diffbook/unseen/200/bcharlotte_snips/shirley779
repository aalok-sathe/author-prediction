I
have
a
great
horror
of
them.
They
seem
to
me
little
ruffians,
who
take
an
unnatural
delight
in
killing
and
tormenting
birds,
and
insects,
and
kittens,
and
whatever
is
weaker
than
themselves.
But
you
are
so
different
I
am
quite
fond
of
you.
You
have
almost
as
much
sense
as
a
man
(far
more,
God
wot,"
she
muttered
to
herself,
"than

fork.
"What
are
you
two
about,"
she
continued,
"ransacking
Mr.
Moore's
desk?"
"Looking
at
your
old
copy
books,"
returned
Caroline.
"My
old
copy
books?"
"French
exercise

Look

They
must
be
held
precious;
they
are
kept
carefully."
She
showed
the
bundle.
Shirley
snatched
it

she
said.
"I
