"'There
has
been
error
in
what
I
have
done,'
I
said,
'and
it
has
won
me
bitter
wages,
which
I
will
go
and
spend
far
from
her
who
gave
them.'
"I
took
my
hat.
All
the
time
I
could
not
have
borne
to
depart
so,
and

sincere,
and
that
my
wish

In
fact,
in
her
case
self

was
a
chimera.
"At
last
she
extended
her
hand.
For
the
first
time
I
wished
to
take
her
in
my
arms
and
kiss
