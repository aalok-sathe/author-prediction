here
in
shadow,
shrinking
into
concealment,
my
mind
darker
than
my
hiding
place?
I
am
one
of
this
world,
no
spirit
a
poor
doomed
mortal,
who
asks,
in
ignorance
and
hopelessness,
wherefore
she
was
born,
to
what
end
she
lives;
whose
mind
for
ever
runs
on
the
question,
how
she
shall
at
last
encounter,
and
by
whom
be
sustained
through
death.
"This
is
the
worst
passage
I
have
come
to
yet;
still
I
was
quite
prepared
for
it.
I
gave
Robert
up,
and
gave
him
up
to
Shirley,
the
first
day
I
heard
she
was
come,
the
first
moment
I
saw
her
rich,
youthful,
and
lovely.
She
has
him
now.
He
is
her
lover.
She
is
his
darling.
She
will
be
far
more
his
darling
yet
when
they
are
married.
The
more
Robert
knows
of
Shirley
the
more
his
soul
will
cleave
to
her.
They
will
both
be
happy,
and
I
do
not
grudge
them
their
bliss;
but
I
groan
under
my
own
misery.
Some
of
my
suffering
is
very
acute.
Truly
I
ought
not
to
have
been
born;
they
should
have
smothered
me
at
the
first
cry."
Here,
Shirley
stepping
aside
to
gather
a
dewy
flower,
she
and
