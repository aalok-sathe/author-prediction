us
hear.
She
thinks
meanly,
she
feels
contemptuously,
doubtless?"
"She
thinks
of
you
almost
as
highly
as
a
woman
can
think
of
a
man.
You
know
she
can
be
eloquent.
I
yet
feel
in
fancy
the
glow
of
the
language
in
which
her
opinion
was
conveyed."
"But
how
does
she
feel?"
"Till
you
shocked
her
(she
said
you
had
shocked
her,
but
she
would
not
tell
me
how)
she
felt
as
a
sister
feels
towards
a
brother
of
whom
she
is
at
once
fond
and
proud."
"I'll
shock
her
no
more,
Cary,
for
the
shock
rebounded
on
myself
till
I
staggered
again.
But
that
comparison
about
sister
and
brother
is
all
nonsense.
She
is
too
rich
and
proud
to
entertain
fraternal
sentiments
for
me."
"You
don't
know
her,
Robert;
and,
somehow,
I
fancy
now
(I
had
other
ideas
formerly)
that
you
cannot
know
her.
You
and
she
are
not
so
constructed
as
to
be
able
thoroughly
to
understand
each
other."
"It
may
be
so.
I
esteem
her,
I
admire
her;
and
yet
my
impressions
concerning
her
are
harsh
perhaps
uncharitable.
I
believe,
for
instance,
that
she
is
incapable
of
love
"
"Shirley
incapable
of
love!"
"That
she
will
never
marry.
