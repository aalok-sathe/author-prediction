in
the
yard,
some
in
their
shirt
sleeves,
some
in
blue
aprons.
Two
figured
conspicuously
in
the
van
of
the
party.
One,
a
little
dapper
strutting
man
with
a
turned
up
nose;
the
other
a
broad
shouldered
fellow,
distinguished
no
less
by
his
demure
face
and
cat
like,
trustless
eyes
than
by
a
wooden
leg
and
stout
crutch.
There
was
a
kind
of

not
all
you
have
to
say
to
me,
I
suppose?
I
imagine
peace
is
not

purpose?"
"As
to
our
purpose,"
began
Barraclough,
"it's
one
that
may
sound
strange
and
perhaps
foolish
to
ears
like
yours,
for
the
childer
of
this
world
is
wiser
in
their
generation
than
the
childer
of

"To
