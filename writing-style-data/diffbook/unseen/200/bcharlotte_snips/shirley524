busy
with
her
office
for
a
while
to
have
leisure
for
looking
round,
but
the
last
cup
being
filled,
she
threw
a
restless
glance
over
the
room.
There
were
some
ladies
and
several
gentlemen
standing
about
yet
unaccommodated
with
seats.
Amidst
a
group
she
recognized
her
spinster
friend,
Miss
Mann,
whom
the
fine
weather
had
tempted,
or
some
urgent
friend
had
persuaded,
to
leave
her
drear
solitude
for
one
hour
of
social
enjoyment.
Miss
Mann
looked
tired
of
standing;
a
lady
in
a
yellow
bonnet
brought
her
a
chair.
Caroline
knew
well
that
chapeau
en
satin
jaune;
she
knew
the
black
hair,
and
the
kindly
though
rather
opinionated
and
froward
looking
face
under
it;
she
knew
that
robe
de
soie
noire,
she
knew
even
that
schall
gris
de
lin;
she
knew,
in
short,
Hortense
Moore,
and
she
wanted
to
jump
up
and
run
to
her
and
kiss
her
to
give
her
one
embrace
for
her
own
sake
and
two
for
her
brother's.
She
half
rose,
indeed,
with
a
smothered
exclamation,
and
perhaps
for
the
impulse
was
very
strong
she
would
have
run
across
the
room
and
actually
saluted
her;
but
a
hand
replaced
her
in
her
seat,
and
a
voice
