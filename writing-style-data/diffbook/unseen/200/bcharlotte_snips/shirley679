threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
demanded
a
kiss.
"My
mother
is
not
civil
to
you,"
said
the
petitioner,
as
she
received
and
repaid
a
smiling
salute,
"and
Rose
there
takes
no
notice
of
you;
it
is
their
way.
If,
instead
of
you,
a
white
angel,
with
a
crown
of
stars,
had
come
into
the
room,
mother
would
nod
stiffly,
and
Rose
never
lift
her
head
at
all;
but
I
will
be
your
friend
I
have
always
liked
you."
"Jessie,
curb
that
tongue
of
yours,
and
repress
your
forwardness!"
said
Mrs.
Yorke.
"But,
mother,
you
are
so
frozen!"
expostulated
Jessie.
"Miss
Helstone
has
never
done
you
any
harm;
why
can't
you
be
kind
to
her?
You
sit
so
stiff,
and
look
so
cold,
and
speak
so
dry
what
for?
That's
just
the
fashion
in
which
you
treat
Miss
Shirley
Keeldar
and
every
other
young
lady
who
comes
to
our
house.
And
Rose
there
is
such
an
aut
aut
I
have
forgotten
the
word,
but
it
means
a
machine
in
the
shape
of
a
human
being.
However,
between
you,
you
will
drive
every
soul
away
from
Briarmains;
Martin
often
says
so."
"I
am
an
automaton?
Good!
Let
me
alone,
then,"
