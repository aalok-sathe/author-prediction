it
in
the
singing
of
many
birds,
for
which
that
shade
made
a
home.
This
was
no
trodden
way.
The
freshness
of
the
wood
flowers
attested
that
foot
of
man
seldom
pressed
them;
the
abounding
wild
roses
looked
as
if
they
budded,
bloomed,
and
faded
under
the
watch
of
solitude,
as

in
a
sultan's
harem.
Here
you
saw
the
sweet
azure

from
human
habitations,
and
entered
the
still

by
this
one
youthful
friend,
a
propitious
change
seemed
to
steal
over
her
mind
and
beam
in
her
countenance.
When
with
Caroline
and
Caroline
only
her
heart,
you
would
have
