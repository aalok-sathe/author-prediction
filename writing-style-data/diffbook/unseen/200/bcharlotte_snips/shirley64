too
much
occupied
with
their
discourse
to
notice
its
approach
till
it
was
close
upon
them.
"Nah,
maister;
did
th'
wagons
hit
home?"
demanded
a
voice
from
the
vehicle.
"Can
that
be
Joe
Scott?"
"Ay,
ay!"
returned
another
voice;
for
the
gig
contained
two
persons,
as
was
seen
by
the
glimmer
of
its
lamp.
The
men
with
the
lanterns
had
now
fallen
into
the
rear,
or
rather,
the
equestrians

pedestrians.
"Ay,
Mr.
Moore,
it's
Joe
Scott.
I'm

restoring
him
to
you?"

for
I
could
better
have
afforded
to
lose
a
better
man.
That
is
you,
I
suppose,
Mr.
Yorke,
by
your
voice?"
"Ay,
lad,
it's
me.
I
was
coming
home
from
Stilbro'
market,
and
just
as
I
got
to
the
middle
of
the
moor,
and
was
whipping
on
as
swift
as
the
wind
(for
these,
they
say,
are
not
safe
times,
thanks
to
a
bad
government!),
I
heard
a
groan.
I
pulled
up.
Some
would
have
whipt
on
faster;
