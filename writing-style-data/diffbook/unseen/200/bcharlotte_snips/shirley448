and
a
well
filled
purse
before
her.
She
was
looking
mighty
serious,
but
a
little
puzzled.
She
said
she
had
been
"casting
an
eye"
over
the
weekly
expenditure
in
housekeeping
at
the
hall,
trying
to
find
out
where
she
could
retrench;
that
she
had
also
just
given
audience
to
Mrs.
Gill,
the
cook,
and
had
sent
that
person
away
with
a
notion
that
her
(Shirley's)
brain
was
certainly
crazed.
"I
have

to
the
practical
part
I
could
retrench
nothing.
I
had
not
firmness
to
take
off
a
single
pound
of
butter,
or
to
prosecute
to
any
clear
result
an
inquest
into
the
destiny
of
either
dripping,
lard,
bread,
cold
meat,
or
other
kitchen
perquisite
whatever.
I
