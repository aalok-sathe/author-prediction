once
or
twice
before,
but
in
which
he
had
not
hitherto
met
with
the
success
he
doubtless
opined
his
merits
deserved),
approached
a
sofa
on
which
Miss
Helstone
was
seated,
and
depositing
his
great
Irish
frame
near
her,
tried
his
hand
(or
rather
tongue)
at
a
fine
speech
or
two,
accompanied
by
grins
the
most
extraordinary
and
incomprehensible.
In
the
course
of
his
efforts
to
render
himself
agreeable,
he
contrived
to
possess
himself
of
the
two
long
sofa
cushions
and
a
square
one;
with
which,
after
rolling
them
about
for
some
time
with
strange
gestures,
he
managed
to
erect
a
sort
of
barrier
between
himself
and
the
object
of
his
attentions.
Caroline,
quite
willing
that
they
should
be
sundered,
soon
devised
an
excuse
for
stepping
over
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
room,
and
taking
up
a
position
beside
Mrs.
Sykes,
of
which
good
lady
she
entreated
some
instruction
in
a
new
stitch
in
ornamental
knitting,
a
favour
readily
granted;
and
thus
Peter
Augustus
was
thrown
out.
Very
sullenly
did
his
countenance
lower
when
he
saw
himself
abandoned
left
entirely
to
his
own
resources,
on
a
large
sofa,
with
the
charge
of
three
small
cushions
on
his
hands.
The
fact
