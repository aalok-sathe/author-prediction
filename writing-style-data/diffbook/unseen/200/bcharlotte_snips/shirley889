market
day.
Moore
arrived
in
time
to
take
his
usual
place
at
the
market
dinner.
As
something
of
a
stranger,
and
as
a
man
of
note
and
action,
the
assembled
manufacturers
received
him
with
a
certain
distinction.
Some,
who
in
public
would
scarcely
have
dared
to
acknowledge
his
acquaintance,
lest
a
little
of
the
hate
and
vengeance
laid
up
in
store
for
him
should
perchance
have
fallen
on
them,
in
private
hailed
him
as
in
some
sort
their
champion.
When
the
wine
had
circulated,
their
respect
would
have
kindled
to
enthusiasm
had
not
Moore's
unshaken
nonchalance
held
it
in
a
damp,
low,
smouldering
state.
Mr.
Yorke,
the
permanent
president
of
these
dinners,
witnessed
his
young
friend's
bearing
with
exceeding
complacency.
If
one
thing
could
stir
his
temper
or
excite
his
contempt
more
than
another,
it
was
to
see
a
man
befooled
by
flattery
or
elate
with
popularity.
If
one
thing
smoothed,
soothed,
and
charmed
him
especially,
it
was
the
spectacle
of
a
public
character
incapable
of
relishing
his
publicity
incapable,
I
say.
Disdain
would
but
have
incensed;
it
was
indifference
that
appeased
his
rough
spirit.
Robert,
leaning
back
in
his
chair,
quiet
and
almost
surly,
while
