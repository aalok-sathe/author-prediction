whispered
to
her
friend.
And
now
solemn
and
sombre
as
to
their
colour,
though
bland
enough
as
to
their
faces
appeared
at
the
dining
room
door
the
three
rectors.
They
had
hitherto
been
busy
in
the
church,
and
were
now
coming
to
take
some
little
refreshment
for
the
body,
ere
the
march
commenced.
The
large
morocco
covered
easy
chair
had
been
left
vacant
for
Dr.

the
other
ladies
of
his
congregation
were
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left,
expressing
their
hopes
that
he
was
not
fatigued,
their
fears
that
the
day
would
be
too
warm
for
him.
Mrs.
Boultby,
who
held
an
opinion
that
when
her
lord
dropped
asleep
after
a
good
dinner
his
face
became
as
the
face
of
an
angel,

bending
over
him,
tenderly
wiping
some
perspiration,
