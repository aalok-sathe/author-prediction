twining
it
round
her
fingers.
She
took
up
the
theme
again
five
minutes
after,
as
Caroline
fastened
her
dress
and
clasped
her
girdle.
"If
men
could
see
us
as
we
really
are,
they
would
be
a
little
amazed;
but
the
cleverest,
the
acutest
men
are
often
under
an
illusion
about
women.
They
do
not
read
them
in
a
true
light;
they
misapprehend
them,
both
for
good
and
evil.
Their
good
woman
is
a
queer
thing,
half
doll,
half
angel;
their
bad
woman
almost
always
a
fiend.
Then
to
hear
them
fall
into
ecstasies
with
each
other's
creations
worshipping
the
heroine
of
such
a
poem,
novel,
drama
thinking
it
fine,
divine!
Fine
and
divine
it
may
be,
but
often
quite
artificial
false
as
the
rose
in
my
best
bonnet
there.
If
I
spoke
all
I
think
on
this
point,
if
I
gave
my
real
opinion
of
some
first
rate
female
characters
in
first
rate
works,
where
should
I
be?
Dead
under
a
cairn
of
avenging
stones
in
half
an
hour."
"Shirley,
you
chatter
so,
I
can't
fasten
you.
Be
still.
And,
after
all,
authors'
heroines
are
almost
as
good
as
authoresses'
heroes."
"Not

all.
