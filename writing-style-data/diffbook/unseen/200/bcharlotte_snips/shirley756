miserly;
and
yet
you
are
not,
for
you
give
liberally
to
the
poor
and
to
religious
societies
though
your
gifts
are
conveyed
so
secretly
and
quietly
that
they
are
known
to
few
except
the
receivers.
But
I
will
be
your
lady's
maid
myself.
When
I
get
a
little
stronger
I
will
set
to
work,
and
you
must
be
good,
mamma,
and
do
as
I
bid
you."
And
Caroline,
sitting
near
her
mother,
rearranged
her
muslin
handkerchief
and
resmoothed
her
hair.
"My
own
mamma,"
then
she
went
on,
as
if
pleasing
herself
with
the
thought
of
their
relationship,
"who
belongs
to
me,
and
to
whom
I
belong!
I
am
a
rich
girl
now.
I
have
something
I
can
love
well,
and
not
be
afraid
of
loving.
Mamma,
who
gave
you
this
little
brooch?
Let
me
unpin
it
and
look
at
it."
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
usually
shrank
from
meddling
fingers
and
near
approach,
allowed
the
license
complacently.
"Did
papa
give
you
this,
mamma?"
"My
sister
gave
it
me
my
only
sister,
Cary.
Would
that
your
Aunt
Caroline
had
lived
to
see
her
niece!"
"Have
you
nothing
of
papa's
no
trinket,
no
gift
of
his?"
"I
have
one
thing."
"That
you
prize?"
"That
