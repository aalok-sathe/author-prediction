eyes.
I
have
loved,
do
love,
and
must
love
him.
I
would
be
his
wife
if
I
could;
as
I
cannot,
I
must
go
where
I
shall
never
see
him.
There
is
but
one
alternative
to
cleave
to
him
as
if
I
were
a
part
of
him,
or
to
be
sundered
from
him
wide
as
the
two
poles
of
a
sphere.
Sunder
me
then,
Providence.
Part
us
speedily."
Some
such
aspirations
as
these
were
again
working
in
her
mind
late
in
the
afternoon,
when
the
apparition
of
one
of
the
personages
haunting
her
thoughts
passed
the
parlour
window.
Miss
Keeldar
sauntered
slowly
by,
her
gait,
her
countenance,
wearing
that
mixture
of
wistfulness
and
carelessness
which,
when
quiescent,
was
the
wonted
cast
of
her
look
and
character
of
her
bearing.
When
animated,
the
carelessness
quite
vanished,
the
wistfulness
became
blent
with
a
genial
gaiety,
seasoning
the
laugh,
the
smile,
the
glance,
with
a
unique
flavour
of
sentiment,
so
that
mirth
from
her
never
resembled
"the
crackling
of
thorns
under
a
pot."
"What
do
you
mean
by
not
coming
to
see
me
this
afternoon,
as
you
promised?"
was
her
address
to
Caroline
as
she
entered
the
room.
"I
was
not
in
the
