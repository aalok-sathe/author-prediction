entirely
to
their
own
fault,
to
sever
himself
from
the
masters,
and
advocate
freely
the
cause
of
the
operatives.
Mr.
Yorke's
family
was
the
first
and
oldest
in
the
district;
and
he,
though
not
the
wealthiest,
was
one
of
the
most
influential
men.
His
education
had
been
good.
In
his
youth,
before
the
French
Revolution,
he
had
travelled
on
the
Continent.
He
was
an
adept
in
the
French
and
Italian
languages.
During
a
two
years'
sojourn
in
Italy
he
had
collected
many
good
paintings
and
tasteful
rarities,
with
which
his
residence
was
now
adorned.
His
manners,
when
he
liked,
were
those
of
a
finished
gentleman
of
the
old
school;
his
conversation,
when
he
was
disposed
to
please,
was
singularly
interesting
and
original;
and
if
he
usually
expressed
himself
in
the
Yorkshire
dialect,
it
was
because
he
chose
to
do
so,
preferring
his
native
Doric
to
a
more
refined
vocabulary,
"A
Yorkshire
burr,"
he
affirmed,
"was
as
much
better
than
a
cockney's
lisp
as
a
bull's
bellow
than
a
raton's
squeak."
Mr.
Yorke
knew
every
one,
and
was
known
by
every
one,
for
miles
round;
yet
his
intimate
acquaintances
were
very
few.
Himself
thoroughly
original,
he
had
no
taste
for
what
