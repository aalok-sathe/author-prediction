barely
thirty.
There
are
moments
when
life,
for
no
other
reason
than
my
own
youth,
beams
with
sweet
hues
upon
me.
"It
was
time
to
go
to
the
schoolroom.
I
went.
That
same
schoolroom
is
rather
pleasant
in
a
morning.
The
sun
then
shines
through
the
low
lattice;
the
books
are
in
order;
there
are
no
papers
strewn
about;
the
fire

when
there
was
'silence

Her
hair
was
always
dusk
as
night
and
fine
as
silk,
her
neck
was
always
fair,
flexible,
polished;
but
both
have
now
a
new
charm.
The
tresses
are
soft
as
shadow,
the
shoulders
they
fall
on
wear
a
goddess
grace.
Once
I
only
saw
her
beauty,
