her
heart.
Hush,
Caroline!
You
will
see
her
and
feel
as
I
do,
if
we
are
both
silent."
"I
will
humour
your
whim;
but
you
will
begin
talking
again
ere
ten
minutes
are
over."
Miss
Keeldar,
on
whom
the
soft
excitement
of
the
warm
summer
evening
seemed
working
with
unwonted
power,
leaned
against
an
upright
headstone;
she
fixed

would
remember
her
child!
Oh
that
I
might
know
her,
and
knowing,
love
her!"
Such
was
her
aspiration.
The
longing
of
her
childhood
filled
her
soul

in
her
crib,
and
which
fear
of
its

her
heart,
