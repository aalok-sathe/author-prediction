her.
Recollections
of
happy
trysts
of
lovers,
commemorated
in
old
ballads,
returned
on
her
mind;
she
thought
such
tryst
in
such
scene
would
be
blissful.
Where
now
was
Robert?
she
asked.
Not
at
the
Hollow;
she
had
watched
for
his
lamp
long,
and
had
not
seen
it.
She
questioned
within
herself
whether
she
and
Moore
were
ever
destined
to
meet
and
speak
again.
Suddenly
the
door
within
the
stone
porch
of
the
hall
opened,
and
two
men
came
out
one
elderly
and
white
headed,
the
other
young,
dark
haired,
and
tall.
They
passed
across
the
lawn,
out
through
a
portal
in
the
garden
wall.
Caroline
saw
them
cross
the
road,
pass
the
stile,
descend
the
fields;
she
saw
them
disappear.
Robert
Moore
had
passed
before
her
with
his
friend
Mr.
Yorke.
Neither
had
seen
her.
The
apparition
had
been
transient
scarce
seen
ere
gone;
but
its
electric
passage
left
her
veins
kindled,
her
soul
insurgent.
It
found
her
despairing,
it
left
her
desperate
two
different
states.
"Oh,
had
he
but
been
alone!
had
he
but
seen
me!"
was
her
cry.
"He
would
have
said
something.
He
would
have
given
me
his
hand.
He
does,
he
must,
love
me
a
little.
