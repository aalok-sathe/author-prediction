By
the
bye,
do
you
put
your
pencil
to
your
lips
when
you
paint?"
"Sometimes,
uncle,
when
I
forget."
"Then
it
is
that
which
is
poisoning
you.
The
paints
are
deleterious,
child.
There
is
white
lead
and
red
lead,
and
verdigris,
and
gamboge,
and
twenty
other
poisons
in
those
colour
cakes.
Lock
them
up!
lock
them
up!
Get
your
bonnet
on.
I
want
you
to
make
a
call
with
me."
"With
you,
uncle?"
This
question
was
asked
in
a
tone
of
surprise.
She
was
not
accustomed
to
make
calls
with
her
uncle.
She
never
rode
or
walked
out
with
him
on
any
occasion.
"Quick!
quick!
I
am
always
busy,
you
know.
I
have
no
time
to
lose."
She
hurriedly
gathered
up
her
materials,
asking,
meantime,
where
they
were
going.
"To
Fieldhead."
"Fieldhead!
What!
to
see
old
James
Booth,
the
gardener?
Is
he
ill?"
"We
are
going
to
see
Miss
Shirley
Keeldar."
"Miss
Keeldar!
Is
she
coming
to
Yorkshire?
Is
she
at
Fieldhead?"
"She
is.
She
has
been
there
a
week.
I
met
her
at
a
party
last
night
that
party
to
which
you
would
not
go.
I
was
pleased
with
her.
I
choose
that
you
shall
make
her
acquaintance.
