valuable.
Even
by
candle
light
the
bright
clear
skies,
the
soft
distances,
with
blue
air
quivering
between
the
eye
and
the
hills,
the
fresh
tints,
and
well
massed
lights
and
shadows,
charmed
the
view.
The
subjects
were
all
pastoral,
the
scenes
were
all
sunny.
There
was
a
guitar
and
some
music
on
a
sofa;
there
were
cameos,
beautiful
miniatures;
a
set
of
Grecian
looking
vases
on
the
mantelpiece;
there
were
books
well
arranged
in
two
elegant
bookcases.
Mr.
Yorke
bade
his
guests
be
seated.
He
then
rang
for
wine.
To
the
servant
who
brought
it
he
gave
hospitable
orders
for
the
refreshment
of
the
men
in
the
kitchen.
The
rector
remained
standing;
he
seemed
not
to
like
his
quarters;
he
would
not
touch
the
wine
his
host
offered
him.
"E'en
as
you
will,"
remarked
Mr.
Yorke.
"I
reckon
you're
thinking
of
Eastern
customs,
Mr.
Helstone,
and
you'll
not
eat
nor
drink
under
my
roof,
feared
we
suld
be
forced
to
be
friends;
but
I
am
not
so
particular
or
superstitious.
You
might
sup
the
contents
of
that
decanter,
and
you
might
give
me
a
bottle
of
the
best
in
your
own
cellar,
and
I'd
hold
myself
free
to
oppose
you
