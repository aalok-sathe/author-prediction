Who
is
this?
I
see
a
shape
at
my
bedside."
"It
is
myself
it
is
your
friend
your
nurse
your
Lean
your
head
on
my
shoulder.
Collect
yourself."
In
a
lower
tone
"O
God,
take
pity!
Give
her
life,
and
me
strength!
Send
me
courage!
Teach
me
words!"
Some
minutes
passed
in
silence.
The
patient
lay
mute
and
passive
in
the
trembling
arms,
on
the
throbbing
bosom
of
the
nurse.
"I
am
better
now,"
whispered
Caroline
at
last,
"much
better.
I
feel
where
I
am.
This
is
Mrs.
Pryor
near
me.
I
was
dreaming.
I
talk
when
I
wake
up
from
dreams;
people
often
do
in
illness.
How
fast
your
heart
beats,
ma'am!
Do
not
be
afraid."
"It
is
not
fear,
child
only
a
little
anxiety,
which
will
pass.
I
have
brought
you
some
tea,
Cary.
Your
uncle
made
it
himself.
You
know
he
says
he
can
make
a
better
cup
of
tea
than
any
housewife
can.
Taste
it.
He
is
concerned
to
hear
that
you
eat
so
little;
he
would
be
glad
if
you
had
a
better
appetite."
"I
am
thirsty.
Let
me
drink."
She
drank
eagerly.
"What
o'clock
is
it,
ma'am?"
she
asked.
"Past
nine."
"Not
later?
Oh!
