usual;
I
could
not
bear
to
be
out
of
her
presence;
I
returned
to
it,
and
basked
in
it,
like
Tartar
in
the
sun.
If
she
left
the
oak
parlour,
instinctively
I
rose
and
left
it
too.
She
chid
me
for
this
procedure
more
than
once.
I
did
it
with
a
vague,
blundering
idea
of
getting
a
word
with
her
in
the
hall
or
elsewhere.
Yesterday
towards
dusk
I
had
her
to
myself
for
five
minutes
by
the
hall
fire.
We
stood
side
by
side;
she
was
railing
at
me,
and
I
was
enjoying
the
sound
of
her
voice.
The
young
ladies
passed,
and
looked
at
us;
we
did
not
separate.
Ere
long
they
repassed,
and
again
looked.
Mrs.
Sympson
came;
we
did
not
move.
Mr.
Sympson
opened
the
dining
room
door.
Shirley
flashed
him
back
full
payment
for
his
spying
gaze.
She
curled
her
lip
and
tossed
her
tresses.
The
glance
she
gave
was
at
once
explanatory
and
defiant.
It
said:
'I
like
Mr.
Moore's
society,
and
I
dare
you
to
find
fault
with
my
taste.'
"I
asked,
'Do
you
mean
him
to
understand
how
matters
are?'
"'I
do,'
said
she;
'but
I
leave
the
development
to
chance.
