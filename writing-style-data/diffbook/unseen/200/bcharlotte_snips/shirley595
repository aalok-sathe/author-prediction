girls
met
no
living
soul
on
their
way
back
to
the
rectory.
They
let
themselves
in
noiselessly;
they
stole
upstairs
unheard
the
breaking
morning
gave
them
what
light
they
needed.
Shirley
sought
her
couch
immediately;
and
though
the
room
was
strange
for
she
had
never
slept
at
the
rectory
before
and
though
the
recent
scene
was
one
unparalleled
for
excitement
and
terror
by
any
it
had
hitherto
been
her
lot
to
witness,
yet
scarce
was
her
head
laid
on
the
pillow
ere
a
deep,
refreshing
sleep
closed
her
eyes
and
calmed
her
senses.
Perfect
health
was
Shirley's
enviable
portion.
Though
warm
hearted
and
sympathetic,
she
was
not
nervous;
powerful
emotions
could
rouse
and
sway
without
exhausting
her
spirit.
The
tempest
troubled
and
shook
her
while
it
lasted,
but
it
left
her
elasticity
unbent,
and
her
freshness
quite
unblighted.
As
every
day
brought
her
stimulating
emotion,
so
every
night
yielded
her
recreating
rest.
Caroline
now
watched
her
sleeping,
and
read
the
serenity
of
her
mind
in
the
beauty
of
her
happy
countenance.
For
herself,
being
of
a
different
temperament,
she
could
not
sleep.
The
commonplace
excitement
of
the
tea
drinking
and
school
gathering
would
alone
have
sufficed
to
make
her
restless
