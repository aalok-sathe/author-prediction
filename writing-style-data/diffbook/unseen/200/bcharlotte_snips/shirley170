interesting
one
it
chanced
to
be,
as
new
movements
had
just
taken
place
in
the
Peninsula,
and
certain
columns
of
the
journal
were
rich
in
long
dispatches
from
General
Lord
Wellington.
He
little
knew,
meantime,
what
thoughts
were
busy
in
his
niece's
mind
thoughts
the
conversation
of
the
past
half
hour
had
revived
but
not

they
now,
as
disturbed

James
Helstone,
Matthewson
Helstone's
brother.
Rumours
had
reached
her
ear
of
what
that
father's
character
was;
old
servants
