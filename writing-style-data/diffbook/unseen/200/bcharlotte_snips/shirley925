that
letter."
"You
cannot
see
it."
"I
must
and
shall,
ma'am;
I
am
your
guardian."
"Having
ceased
to
be
a
ward,
I
have
no
guardian."
"Ungrateful
being!
Reared
by
me
as
my
own
daughter
"
"Once
more,
uncle,
have
the
kindness
to
keep
to
the
point.
Let
us
both
remain
cool.
For
my
part,
I
do
not
wish
to
get
into
a
passion;
but,
you
know,
once
drive
me
beyond
certain
bounds,
I
care

Listen!
You
have
asked
me
whether
Sir
Philip
made
me
an
offer.
That

is
answered.

"Refused

You
you,
Shirley
Keeldar,
refused
Sir
Philip
Nunnely?"
"I
did."
The
poor
gentleman
bounced
from
his
chair,
and
first
rushed
and
then
trotted
through
the
room.
"There
it
is!
There
it
is!
There
it
is!"
"Sincerely
speaking,
I
am
sorry,
uncle,
you
are
so
disappointed."
Concession,
contrition,
never
do
any
good
with
some
people.
Instead
of
softening
and
conciliating,
they
but
embolden
and
harden
them.
