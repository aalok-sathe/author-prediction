called
a
servant
in
that
voice
save
once
before,
and
that
was
when
she
had
seen
from
the
window
Tartar
in
full
tug
with
two
carriers'
dogs,
each
of
them
a
match
for
him
in
size,
if
not
in
courage,
and
their
masters
standing
by,
encouraging
their
animals,
while
hers
was
unbefriended.
Then
indeed
she
had
summoned
John
as
if
the
Day
of
Judgment
were
at

Nor
had
she
waited
for
the
said
John's
coming,
but
had
walked

eye,
just
above
and

organ
the
vengeful
fangs
were
inserted.
Five
or
six
men
were
presently
on
the
spot
to
help
her,
but
she
never
thanked
one
of
them.
"They
might
have
come
before
if
their
will
had
been

she
said.
She
had
not

for
anybody
during
