with
effective
descriptions
of
stripes
and
scourgings,
I
am
happy
to
be
able
to
inform
him
that
neither
Mr.
Moore
nor
his
overlooker
ever
struck
a
child
in
their
mill.
Joe
had,
indeed,
once
very
severely
flogged
a
son
of
his
own
for
telling
a
lie
and
persisting
in
it;
but,
like
his
employer,
he
was
too
phlegmatic,
too
calm,
as
well
as
too
reasonable
a
man,
to
make
corporal
chastisement
other
than
the
exception
to
his
treatment
of
the
young.
Mr.
Moore
haunted
his
mill,
his
mill
yard,
his
dye
house,
and
his
warehouse
till
the
sickly
dawn
strengthened
into
day.
The
sun
even
rose
at
least
a
white
disc,
clear,
tintless,
and
almost
chill
looking
as
ice,
peeped
over
the
dark
crest
of
a
hill,
changed
to
silver
the
livid
edge
of
the
cloud
above
it,
and
looked
solemnly
down
the
whole
length
of
the
den,
or
narrow
dale,
to
whose
strait
bounds
we
are
at
present
limited.
It
was
eight
o'clock;
the
mill
lights
were
all
extinguished;
the
signal
was
given
for
breakfast;
the
children,
released
for
half
an
hour
from
toil,
betook
themselves
to
the
little
tin
cans
which
held
their
coffee,
and
to
the
small
