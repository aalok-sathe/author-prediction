neither
of
us
would
bear
it.
The
'virtuous
woman,'
again,
had
her
household
up
in
the
very
middle
of
the
night;
she
'got
breakfast
over,'
as
Mrs.
Sykes
says,
before
one
o'clock
a.m.;
but
she
had
something
more
to
do
than
spin
and
give
out
portions.
She
was
a
manufacturer
she
made
fine
linen
and
sold
it;
she
was
an
agriculturist
she
bought
estates
and
planted
vineyards.
That
woman
was
a
manager.
She
was
what
the
matrons
hereabouts
call
'a
clever
woman.'
On
the
whole,
I
like
her
a
good
deal
better
than
Lucretia;
but
I
don't
believe
either
Mr.
Armitage
or
Mr.
Sykes
could
have
got
the
advantage
of
her
in
a
bargain.
Yet
I
like
her.
'Strength
and
honour
were
her
clothing;
the
heart
of
her
husband
safely
trusted
in
her.
She
opened
her
mouth
with
wisdom;
in
her
tongue
was
the
law
of
kindness;
her
children
rose
up
and
called
her
blessed;
her
husband
also
praised
her.'
King
of
Israel!
your
model
of
a
woman
is
a
worthy
model!
But
are
we,
in
these
days,
brought
up
to
be
like
her?
Men
of
Yorkshire!
do
your
daughters
reach
this
royal
standard?
Can
they
reach
it?
Can
you
