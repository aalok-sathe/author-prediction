those
who
came
rather
late
he
said
a
word
of
reprimand,
which
was
a
little
more
sharply
repeated
by
Joe
Scott
when
the
lingerers
reached
the
work
rooms.
Neither
master
nor
overlooker
spoke
savagely.
They
were
not
savage
men
either
of
them,
though
it
appeared
both
were
rigid,
for
they
fined
a
delinquent
who
came
considerably
too
late.
Mr.
Moore
made
him
pay
his
penny
down
ere
he
entered,
and
informed
him
that
the
next
repetition
of
the
fault
would
cost
him
twopence.
Rules,
no
doubt,
are
necessary
in
such
cases,
and
coarse
and
cruel
masters
will
make
coarse
and
cruel
rules,
which,
at
the
time
we
treat
of
at
least,
they
used
sometimes
to
enforce
tyrannically;
but
though
I
describe
imperfect
characters
(every
character
in
this
book
will
be
found
to
be
more
or
less
imperfect,
my
pen
refusing
to
draw
anything
in
the
model
line),
I
have
not
undertaken
to
handle
degraded
or
utterly
infamous
ones.
Child
torturers,
slave
masters
and
drivers,
I
consign
to
the
hands
of
jailers.
The
novelist
may
be
excused
from
sullying
his
page
with
the
record
of
their
deeds.
Instead,
then,
of
harrowing
up
my
reader's
soul
and
delighting
his
organ
of
wonder
