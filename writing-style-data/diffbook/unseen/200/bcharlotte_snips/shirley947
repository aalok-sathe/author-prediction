one
instant.
Mrs.
Yorke
hardened
her
heart,
and
sent
them
packing
not
without
opprobrium.
But
how
was
it
when
Hortense
Moore
came?
Not
so
bad
as
might
have
been
expected.
The
whole
family
of
the
Moores
really
seemed
to
suit
Mrs.
Yorke
so
as
no
other
family
had
ever
suited
her.
Hortense
and
she
possessed
an
exhaustless
mutual
theme
of
conversation
in
the
corrupt
propensities
of
servants.
Their
views
of
this
class
were
similar;
they
watched
them
with
the
same
suspicion,
and
judged
them
with
the
same
severity.
Hortense,
too,
from
the
very
first
showed
no
manner
of
jealousy
of
Mrs.
Yorke's
attentions
to
Robert
she
let
her
keep
the
post
of
nurse
with
little
interference;
and,
for
herself,
found
ceaseless
occupation
in
fidgeting
about
the
house,
holding
the
kitchen
under
surveillance,
reporting
what
passed
there,
and,
in
short,
making
herself
generally
useful.
Visitors
they
both
of
them
agreed
in
excluding
sedulously
from
the
sickroom.
They
held
the
young
mill
owner
captive,
and
hardly
let
the
air
breathe
or
the
sun
shine
on
him.
Mr.
MacTurk,
the
surgeon
to
whom
Moore's
case
had
been
committed,
pronounced
his
wound
of
a
dangerous,
but,
he
trusted,
not
of
a
hopeless
character.
