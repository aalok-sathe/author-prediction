first
he
wished
to
place
with
him
a
nurse
of
his
own
selection;
but
this
neither
Mrs.
Yorke
nor
Hortense
would
hear
of.
They
promised
faithful
observance
of
directions.
He
was
left,
therefore,
for
the
present
in
their
hands.
Doubtless
they
executed
the
trust
to
the
best
of
their
ability;
but
something
got
wrong.
The
bandages
were
displaced
or
tampered
with;
great
loss
of
blood
followed.
MacTurk,
being
summoned,
came
with
steed
afoam.
He
was
one
of
those
surgeons
whom
it
is

to
vex

in
his

it
is
not
necessary
to
strew
the
present
page.
A
bouquet
or
two
of
the
choicest
blossoms
fell
on
the
unperturbed
head
of
one
Mr.
Graves,
a
stony
young
assistant
he
usually
carried
about
with
him;
with
a
second
nosegay
he
gifted
another
young
gentleman
in
his
train
an
interesting
fac
simile
of
himself,
being
indeed
his
own
son;
but
the
full
corbeille
of
blushing
bloom
fell
to
the
lot
of
meddling
womankind,
en
masse.
For
the
best
part
of
one
winter
night
himself
and
satellites
were
busied
about
Moore.
