Love
or
Mammon.
Hercules
holding
the
distaff
was
but
a
faint
type
of
Peter
bearing
the
roses.
He
must
have
thought
this
himself,
for
he
seemed
amazed
at
what
he
had
done.
He
backed
without
a
word;
he
was
going
away
with
a
husky
chuckle
of
self

Miss
Helstone
too
was
smiling.
Moreover,
he
felt
he
was
seen
through,
and
Peter
grew
black
as
a
thunder

When
Shirley
looked
up,
a
fell
eye
was
fastened
on
her.
Malone,
at

had
energy
enough
in
hate.
She
saw
it
in
his
glance.
"Peter
is
