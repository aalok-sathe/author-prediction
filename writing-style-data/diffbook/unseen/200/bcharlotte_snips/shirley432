Gerard
Moore
is
a
hard
dog,
brought
up
to
mill
and
market;
the
person
you
call
your
cousin
Robert
is
sometimes
a
dreamer,
who
lives
elsewhere
than
in
Cloth
hall
and
counting
house."
"Your
two
natures
agree
with
you.
I
think
you
are
looking
in
good
spirits
and
health.
You
have
quite
lost
that

expectation
of
tempest."
"But
you
are
ready
for
a
breeze;
you
are
a
good
seaman,
an
able
commander.
You
are
a
skilful
pilot,
Robert;
you
will
weather
the
storm."
"My
kinswoman
always
thinks
