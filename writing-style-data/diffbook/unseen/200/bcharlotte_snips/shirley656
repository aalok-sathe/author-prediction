for
a
neglectful
swain?
Does
she
sit
the
day
long
bent
over
some
sedentary
task?
Has
she
for
ever
a
book
in
her
hand,
or
sewing
on
her
knee,
and
eyes
only
for
that,
and
words
for
nothing,
and
thoughts
unspoken?
By
no
means.
Shirley
is
all
right.
If
her
wistful
cast
of
physiognomy
is
not
gone,
no
more
is
her
careless
smile.
She
keeps
her
dark
old
manor
house
light
and
bright
with
her
cheery
presence.
The
gallery
and
the
low
ceiled
chambers
that
open
into
it
have
learned
lively
echoes
from
her
voice;
the
dim
entrance
hall,
with
its
one
window,
has
grown
pleasantly
accustomed
to
the
frequent
rustle
of
a
silk
dress,
as
its
wearer
sweeps
across
from
room
to
room,
now
carrying
flowers
to
the
barbarous
peach
bloom
salon,
now
entering
the
dining
room
to
open
its
casements
and
let
in
the
scent
of
mignonette
and
sweet
briar,
anon
bringing
plants
from
the
staircase
window
to
place
in
the
sun
at
the
open
porch
door.
She
takes
her
sewing
occasionally;
but,
by
some
fatality,
she
is
doomed
never
to
sit
steadily
at
it
for
above
five
minutes
at
a
time.
Her
thimble
is
scarcely
fitted
on,
