see
him
even
now."
"Where?"
And
as
Caroline
asked
the
question
she
looked
not
over
the
fields,
but
into
Miss
Keeldar's
eyes,
as
was
her
wont
whenever
Shirley
mentioned
any
object
she
descried
afar.
Her
friend
had
quicker
vision
than
herself,
and
Caroline
seemed
to
think
that
the
secret
of
her
eagle
acuteness
might
be
read
in
her
dark
gray
irides,
or
rather,
perhaps,
she
only
sought
guidance
by
the
direction
of
those
discriminating
and
brilliant
spheres.
"There
is
Moore,"
said
Shirley,
pointing
right
across
the
wide
field
where
a
thousand
children
were
playing,
and
now
nearly
a
thousand
adult
spectators
walking
about.
"There
can
you
miss
the
tall
stature
and
straight
port?
He
looks
amidst
the
set
that
surround
him
like
Eliab
amongst
humbler
shepherds
like
Saul
in
a
war
council;
and
a
war
council
it
is,
if
I
am
not
mistaken."
"Why
so,
Shirley?"
asked
Caroline,
whose
eye
had
at
last
caught
the
object
it
sought.
"Robert
is
just
now
speaking
to
my
uncle,
and
they
are
shaking
hands.
They
are
then
reconciled."
"Reconciled
not
without
good
reason,
depend
on
it
making
common
cause
against
some
common
foe.
And
why,
think
you,
are
Messrs.
Wynne
and
Sykes,
and
