them
away;
and
afterwards
he
said
to
you,
Miss
Shirley,
that
it
was
of
no
use
talking
or
lecturing
now,
but
that
the
tea
things
were
just
brought
into
the
schoolroom,
and
he
was
very
thirsty,
and
he
would
be
glad
if
you
would
leave
your
packing
for
the
present
and
come
and
make
a
cup
of
tea
for
him
and
me.
You
came;
you
would
not
talk
at
first,
but
soon
you
softened
and
grew
cheerful.
Mr.
Moore
began
to
tell
us
about
the
Continent,
the
war,
and
Bonaparte
subjects
we
were
both
fond
of
listening
to.
After
tea
he
said
we
should
neither
of
us
leave
him
that
evening;
he
would
not
let
us
stray
out
of
his
sight,
lest
we
should
again
get
into
mischief.
We
sat
one
on
each
side
of
him.
We
were
so
happy.
I
never
passed
so
pleasant
an
evening.
The
next
day
he
gave
you,
missy,
a
lecture
of
an
hour,
and
wound
it
up
by
marking
you
a
piece
to
learn
in
Bossuet
as
a
punishment
lesson
'Le
Cheval
Dompte.'
You
learned
it
instead
of
packing
up,
Shirley.
We
heard
no
more
of
your
running
away.
Mr.
Moore
used
to
tease
