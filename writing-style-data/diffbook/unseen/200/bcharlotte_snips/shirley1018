extravagances."
"You
have
stolen
my
senses.
Just
now
nothing
will
come
into
my
mind
but
les
litanies
de
la
sainte
Vierge.
Rose
celeste,
reine
des
anges!"
"Tour
d'ivoire,
maison
d'or
is
not
that
the
jargon?
Well,
sit
down
quietly,
and
guess
your
riddle."
"But
'mamma'
charmed
there's
the
puzzle."
"I'll
tell
you
what
mamma
said
when
I

my
dear,
such

Miss
Keeldar's

in
Briarfield
seem
to

of
that
priest.
I
wonder
why;
he
is
bald,
sand
blind,
gray
haired."
"Fanny
will
be
here
to
fetch
me
before
you
have
solved
the
riddle,
if
you
don't
make
haste."
"I'll
guess
no
more
I
am
tired;
and
then
I
don't
care.
Miss
Keeldar
may
marry
le
grand
Turc
for
me."
"Must

must,
and
quickly.
