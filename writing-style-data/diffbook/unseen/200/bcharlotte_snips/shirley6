of
Nunnely
came
to
tea,
remained
to
supper,
occupied
the
spare
bed,
and
favoured
her
with
their
company
to
breakfast
on
Wednesday
morning;
now,
on
Thursday,
they
are
both
here
at
dinner,
and
she
is
almost
certain
they
will
stay
all
night.
"C'en
est
trop,"
she
would
say,
if
she
could
speak
French.
Mr.
Sweeting
is
mincing
the
slice
of
roast
beef
on
his
plate,
and
complaining
that
it
is
very
tough;
Mr.
Donne
says
the
beer
is
flat.
Ay,
that
is
the
worst
of
it:
if
they
would
only
be
civil
Mrs.
Gale
wouldn't
mind
it
so
much,
if
they
would
only
seem
satisfied
with
what
they
get
she
wouldn't
care;
but
"these
young
parsons
is
so
high
and
so
scornful,
they
set
everybody
beneath
their
'fit.'
They
treat
her
with
less
than
civility,
just
because
she
doesn't
keep
a
servant,
but
does
the
work
of
the
house
herself,
as
her
mother
did
afore
her;
then
they
are
always
speaking
against
Yorkshire
ways
and
Yorkshire
folk,"
and
by
that
very
token
Mrs.
Gale
does
not
believe
one
of
them
to
be
a
real
gentleman,
or
come
of
gentle
kin.
"The
old
parsons
is
worth
the
whole
lump
of
college
