unloving

Your
god
rules
at
the
bridal
of
kings;
look
at
your
royal
dynasties!
Your
deity
is
the
deity
of
foreign
aristocracies;
analyze
the
blue
blood
of
Spain!
Your
god
is
the
Hymen
of
France;
what

life?
All
that

decay;
all
declines

and
you
must
associate
no

whirlwind?
I
sweep
your
cobweb
projects
from
my
path,
that
I
may
pass
on
unsullied.
I
am
anchored
on
a
resolve
you
cannot
shake.
My
heart,
my
conscience
shall
dispose
of
my
hand
they
only.
Know
this
