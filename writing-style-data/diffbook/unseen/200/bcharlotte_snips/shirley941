at
Shirley.
"I
shall
be
glad
to
hear
news
of
him.
Is
he
coming
home?"
"He
is
come.
He
is
in
Yorkshire.
Mr.
Yorke
went
yesterday
to
Stilbro'
to
meet
him."
"Mr.
Moore,
something
is
wrong
"
"Did
my
voice
tremble?
He
is
now
at
Briarmains,
and
I
am
going
to
see
him."
"What
has
occurred?"
"If
you
turn
so
pale
I
shall
be
sorry
I
have
spoken.
It
might
have
been
worse.
Robert
is
not
dead,
but
much
hurt."
"O
sir,
it
is
you
who
are
pale.
Sit
down
near
me."
"Read
the
note.
Let
me
open
it."
Miss
Keeldar
read
the
note.
It
briefly
signified
that
last
night
Robert
Moore
had
been
shot
at
from
behind
the
wall
of
Milldean
plantation,
at
the
foot
of
the
Brow;
that
he
was
wounded
severely,
but
it
was
hoped
not
fatally.
Of
the
assassin,
or
assassins,
nothing
was
known;
they
had
escaped.
"No
doubt,"
Mr.
Yorke
observed,
"it
was
done
in
revenge.
It
was
a
pity
ill
will
had
ever
been
raised;
but
that
could
not
be
helped
now."
"He
is
my
only
brother,"
said
Louis,
as
Shirley
returned
the
note.
"I
cannot
hear
unmoved
that
ruffians
have
laid
in
wait
