looked
at
her
hostess.
Shirley
Keeldar
(she
had
no
Christian
name
but
Shirley:
her
parents,
who
had
wished
to
have
a
son,
finding
that,
after
eight
years
of
marriage,
Providence
had
granted
them
only
a
daughter,
bestowed
on
her
the
same
masculine
family
cognomen
they
would
have
bestowed
on
a
boy,
if
with
a
boy
they
had
been
blessed)
Shirley
Keeldar
was
no
ugly
heiress.
She
was
agreeable
to

Her
height
and

she
might

She

like
Caroline.
Clear
and
dark
were
the
characteristics
of
her
aspect
as
to
colour.
Her
face
and
brow
were
clear,
her
eyes
of
the
darkest
gray
(no
green
lights
in
them
transparent,
pure,
neutral
gray),
and
her
hair
of
the
darkest
brown.
Her
features
were
distinguished
by
which
I
do
not
mean
that
they
were
high,
bony,
and
Roman,
being
indeed
rather
small
and
slightly
marked
than
otherwise,
but
only
