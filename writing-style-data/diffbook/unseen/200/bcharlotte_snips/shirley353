came
down
into
Yorkshire.
I
never
knew
you
guilty
of
it
before."
"Oh!
I
learned
to
whistle
a
long
while
ago."
"Who
taught
you?"
"No
one.
I
took
it
up
by
listening,
and
I
had
laid
it
down
again.
But
lately,
yesterday
evening,
as
I
was
coming
up
our
lane,
I
heard
a
gentleman
whistling
that
very
tune
in
the
field
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge,
and
that
reminded
me."
"What
gentleman
was
it?"
"We
have
only
one
gentleman
in
this
region,
ma'am,
and
that
is
Mr.
Moore
at
least
he
is
the
only
gentleman
who
is
not
gray
haired.
My
two
venerable
favourites,
Mr.
Helstone
and
Mr.
Yorke,
it
is
true,
are
fine
old
beaus,
infinitely
better
than
any
of
the
stupid
young
ones."
Mrs.
Pryor
was
silent.
"You
do
not
like
Mr.
Helstone,
ma'am?"
"My
dear,
Mr.
Helstone's
office
secures
him
from
criticism."
"You
generally
contrive
to
leave
the
room
when
he
is
announced."
"Do
you
walk
out
this
morning,
my
dear?"
"Yes,
I
shall
go
to
the
rectory,
and
seek
and
find
Caroline
Helstone,
and
make
her
take
some
exercise.
She
shall
have
a
breezy
walk
over
Nunnely
Common."
"If
you
go
in
that
direction,
