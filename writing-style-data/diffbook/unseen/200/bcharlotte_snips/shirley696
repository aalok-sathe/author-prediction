hovering
round
her
lips,
that
at
last
she
had
hit
on
a
topic
that
pleased.
Many
a
time
had
she
heard
the
fat
"Adonis
of
fifty"
discussed
at
her
father's
breakfast
table,
and
she
now
gave
Mr.
Yorke's
comments
on
the
theme
genuine
as
uttered
by
his
Yorkshire
lips.
But,
Jessie,
I
will
write
about
you
no
more.
This
is
an
autumn
evening,
wet
and
wild.
There
is
only
one
cloud
in
the
sky,
but
it
curtains
it
from
pole
to
pole.
The
wind
cannot
rest;
it
hurries
sobbing
over
hills
of
sullen
outline,
colourless
with
twilight
and
mist.
Rain
has
beat
all
day
on
that
church
tower.
It
rises
dark
from
the
stony
enclosure
of
its
graveyard.
The
nettles,
the
long
grass,
and
the
tombs
all
drip
with
wet.
This
evening
reminds
me
too
forcibly
of
another
evening
some
years
ago
a
howling,
rainy
autumn
evening
too
when
certain
who
had
that
day
performed
a
pilgrimage
to
a
grave
new
made
in
a
heretic
cemetery
sat
near
a
wood
fire
on
the
hearth
of
a
foreign
dwelling.
They
were
merry
and
social,
but
they
each
knew
that
a
gap,
never
to
be
filled,
had
been
made
in
their
circle.
