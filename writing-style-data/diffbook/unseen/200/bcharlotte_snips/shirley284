England
began
to
look
pleasant:
her
fields
grew
green,
her
hills
fresh,
her
gardens
blooming;
but
at
heart
she
was
no
better.
Still
her
poor
were
wretched,
still
their
employers
were
harassed.
Commerce,
in
some
of
its
branches,
seemed
threatened
with
paralysis,
for
the
war
continued;
England's
blood
was
shed
and
her
wealth
lavished
all,
it
seemed,
to
attain
most
inadequate
ends.
Some
tidings
there
were
indeed
occasionally
of
successes
in
the
Peninsula,
but
these
came
in
slowly;
long
intervals
occurred
between,
in
which
no
note
was
heard
but
the
insolent
self
felicitations
of
Bonaparte
on
his
continued
triumphs.
Those
who
suffered
from
the
results
of
the
war
felt
this
tedious,
and,
as
they
thought,
hopeless
struggle
against
what
their
fears
or
their
interests
taught
them
to
regard
as
an
invincible
power,
most
insufferable.
They
demanded
peace
on
any
terms.
Men
like
Yorke
and
Moore
and
there
were
thousands
whom
the
war
placed
where
it
placed
them,
shuddering
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
insisted
on
peace
with
the
energy
of
desperation.
They
held
meetings,
they
made
speeches,
they
got
up
petitions
to
extort
this
boon;
on
what
terms
it
was
made
they
cared
not.
All
men,
taken
singly,
are
