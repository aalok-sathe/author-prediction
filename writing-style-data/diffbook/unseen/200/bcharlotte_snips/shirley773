me
as
for
any
monarch."
"You
take
a
sort
of
harsh,
solitary
triumph
in
drawing
pleasure
out
of
the
elements
and
the
inanimate
and
lower
animate
creation."
"Solitary,
but
not
harsh.
With
animals
I
feel
I
am
Adam's
son,
the
heir
of
him
to
whom
dominion
was
given
over
'every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth.'
Your
dog
likes
and
follows
me.

I

into

yard,

pigeons
from
your
dovecot

and
Shirley

standing
on
the
summer
house

Caroline
saw
her
face
as
she
looked
after
the
rude
tutor.
It
was
pale,
as
if
her
pride
bled
inwardly.
"You
see,"
remarked
Caroline
apologetically,
"his
feelings
are
so
often
hurt
it
makes
him
morose."
"You
see,"
retorted
Shirley,
with
ire,
"he
is
a
topic
on
which
you
and
I
shall
quarrel
if
we
discuss
