Keeldar
and
her
uncle
had
characters
that
would
not
harmonize,
that
never
had
harmonized.
He
was
irritable,
and
she
was
spirited.
He
was
despotic,
and
she
liked
freedom.
He
was
worldly,
and
she,
perhaps,
romantic.
Not
without
purpose
had
he
come
down
to
Yorkshire.
His
mission
was
clear,
and
he
intended
to
discharge
it
conscientiously.
He
anxiously
desired
to
have
his
niece

she
would
consent

it.
The
trial
soon
came.
Mr.
Wynne
proposed
in
form
for
his
son,
Samuel
Fawthrop
Wynne.
"Decidedly
suitable!
most
proper!"
pronounced
Mr.
Sympson.
"A
fine
unencumbered
estate,
real
substance,
good
connections.
It
must
be
done!"
He
sent
for
his
niece
to
the
oak
parlour;
he
shut
himself
up
there
with
her
alone;
he
communicated
the
offer;
he
gave
his
opinion;
he
claimed
her
consent.
It
was
withheld.
"No;
