one
simultaneous
bow,
very
majestic
and
mighty
awful.
A
pause
followed.
This
bow
was
of
a
character
to
ensure
silence
for
the
next
five
minutes,
and
it
did.
Mrs.
Sykes
then
inquired
after
Mr.
Helstone,
and
whether
he
had
had
any
return
of
rheumatism,

the
lips
of
the
four
ladies.
"We
were
all
there,"
said
Miss
Mary
"mamma
and

would
insist
