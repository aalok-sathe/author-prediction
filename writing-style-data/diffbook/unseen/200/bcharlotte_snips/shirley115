was
he
not?
Did
he
not
go
with
you
to
Stilbro'
Moor?"
"Yes,
we
set
out
in
very
martial
style,
Caroline;
but
the
prisoners
we
went
to
rescue
met
us
half
way."
"Of
course
nobody
was
hurt?"
"Why,
no;
only
Joe
Scott's
wrists
were
a
little
galled
with
being
pinioned
too
tightly
behind
his
back."
"You
were
not
there?

the
wagons
when
they
were
attacked?"
"No.
One

fortune

be

nobody
dislikes
Mr.
Yorke
at
least,
poor
people
do
not
dislike
him."
"Therefore
he
would
be
a
protection
to
me,
who
am
hated?"
"Who
are
misunderstood.
That,
probably,
is
the
word.
Shall
you
be
late?
Will
he
be
late,
Cousin
Hortense?"
"It
is
too
probable.
He
has
often
much
business
to
transact
at
Whinbury.
