he
known
how
the
case
really
stood,
he
would
hardly
have
been
induced
by
any
persuasion
to
cross
his
former
rival's
threshold.
Mr.
Yorke
did
not
resume
his
lecture
of
Robert
Moore.
The
conversation
ere
long
recommenced
in
a
more
general
form,
though
still
in
a
somewhat
disputative
tone.
The
unquiet
state
of
the
country,
the
various
depredations
lately
committed
on
mill
property
in
the
district,
supplied
abundant
matter
for
disagreement,
especially
as
each
of
the
three
gentlemen
present
differed
more
or
less
in
his
views
on
these
subjects.
Mr.
Helstone
thought
the
masters
aggrieved,
the
workpeople
unreasonable;
he
condemned
sweepingly
the
widespread
spirit
of
disaffection
against
constituted
authorities,
the
growing
indisposition
to
bear
with
patience
evils
he
regarded
as
inevitable.
The
cures
he
prescribed
were
vigorous
government
interference,
strict
magisterial
vigilance;
when
necessary,
prompt
military
coercion.
Mr.
Yorke
wished
to
know
whether
this
interference,
vigilance,
and
coercion
would
feed
those
who
were
hungry,
give
work
to
those
who
wanted
work,
and
whom
no
man
would
hire.
He
scouted
the
idea
of
inevitable
evils.
He
said
public
patience
was
a
camel,
on
whose
back
the
last
atom
that
could
be
borne
had
already
been
laid,
and
that
resistance
was
now
