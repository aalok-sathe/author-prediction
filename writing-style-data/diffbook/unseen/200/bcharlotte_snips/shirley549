mother
might
come
some
happy
day,
and
send
for
her
to
her
presence,
look
upon
her
fondly
with
loving
eyes,
and
say
to
her
tenderly,
in
a
sweet
voice,
"Caroline,
my
child,
I
have
a
home
for
you;
you
shall
live
with
me.
All
the
love
you
have
needed,
and
not
tasted,
from
infancy,
I
have
saved
for
you
carefully.
Come;
it

cherish

A
noise
on
the
road
roused
Caroline
from
her
filial
hopes,
and
Shirley
from
her
Titan
visions.
They
listened,
and
heard
the
tramp
of
horses.
They
looked,
and
saw
a
glitter
through
the
trees.
They
caught
through
the
foliage
glimpses
of
martial
scarlet;
helm
shone,
plume
waved.
Silent
and
orderly,
six
soldiers
rode
softly

"The

we
saw
this
afternoon,"
whispered
Shirley.
"They
have
been
halting
somewhere
till
now.
They
wish
to
be
as
little
noticed
as
possible,
and
are
seeking
their
rendezvous
at
this
quiet
hour,
while
the
people
are
at
church.
Did
I
not
say
we
should
see
unusual
things
ere
long?"
Scarcely
were
sight
and
sound
of
the
soldiers
lost,
when
another
and
somewhat
different
disturbance
broke
the
night
hush
a
child's
impatient
scream.
They
looked.
A
man
