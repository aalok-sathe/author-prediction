into
the
sea.
All
along,
and
among,
and
above
these
crags
dash
and
flash,
sweep
and
leap,
swells,
wreaths,
drifts
of
snowy
spray.
Some
lone
wanderer
is
out
on
these
rocks,
treading
with
cautious
step
the
wet,
wild
seaweed;
glancing
down
into
hollows
where
the
brine
lies
fathoms
deep
and
emerald
clear,
and
seeing
there
wilder
and
stranger
and
huger
vegetation
than
is
found
on
land,
with
treasure
of
shells
some
green,
some
purple,
some
pearly
clustered
in
the
curls
of
the
snaky
plants.
He
hears
a
cry.
Looking
up
and
forward,
he
sees,
at
the
bleak
point
of
the
reef,
a
tall,
pale
thing
shaped
like
man,
but
made
of
spray
transparent,
tremulous,
awful.
It
stands
not
alone.
They
are
all
human
figures
that
wanton
in
the
rocks
a
crowd
of
foam
women
a
band
of
white,
evanescent
Nereids.
Hush!
Shut
the
book;
hide
it
in
the
satchel.
Martin
hears
a
tread.
He
listens.
No
yes.
Once
more
the
dead
leaves,
lightly
crushed,
rustle
on
the
wood
path.
Martin
watches;
the
trees
part,
and
a
woman
issues
forth.
She
is
a
lady
dressed
in
dark
silk,
a
veil
covering
her
face.
Martin
never
met
a
lady
in
this
wood
