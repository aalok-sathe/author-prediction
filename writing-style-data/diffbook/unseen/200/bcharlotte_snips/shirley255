in
her
brief
life,
shed
tears,
she
had
frequent
sorrows;
she
smiled
between,
gladdening
whatever
saw
her.
Her
death
was
tranquil
and
happy
in
Rose's
guardian
arms,
for
Rose
had
been
her
stay
and
defence
through
many
trials.
The
dying
and
the
watching
English
girls
were
at
that
hour
alone
in
a
foreign
country,
and
the
soil
of
that
country
gave
Jessy
a
grave.
Now,
behold
Rose
two
years
later.
The
crosses
and
garlands
looked
strange,
but
the
hills
and
woods
of
this
landscape
look
still
stranger.
This,
indeed,
is
far
from
England;
remote
must
be
the
shores
which
wear
that
wild,
luxuriant
aspect.
This
is
some
virgin
solitude.
Unknown
birds
flutter
round
the
skirts
of
that
forest;
no
European
river
this,
on
whose
banks
Rose
sits
thinking.
The
little
quiet
Yorkshire
girl
is
a
lonely
emigrant
in
some
region
of
the
southern
hemisphere.
Will
she
ever
come
back?
The
three
eldest
of
the
family
are
all
boys
Matthew,
Mark,
and
Martin.
They
are
seated
together
in
that
corner,
engaged
in
some
game.
Observe
their
three
heads:
much
alike
at
a
first
glance;
at
a
second,
different;
at
a
third,
contrasted.
Dark
haired,
dark
eyed,
red
cheeked
are
the
whole
