for
him,
and
shot
him
down,
like
some
wild
beast
from
behind
a
wall."
"Be
comforted;
be
hopeful.
He
will
get
better
I
know
he
will."
Shirley,
solicitous
to
soothe,
held
her
hand
over
Mr.
Moore's
as
it
lay
on
the
arm
of
the
chair.
She
just
touched
it
lightly,
scarce
palpably.
"Well,
give
me
your
hand,"
he
said.
"It
will
be
for
the
first
time;
it
is
in
a
moment
of
calamity.
Give
it
me."
Awaiting
neither
consent
nor
refusal,
he
took
what
he
asked.
"I
am
going
to
Briarmains
now,"
he
went
on.
"I
want
you
to
step
over
to
the
rectory
and
tell
Caroline
Helstone
what
has
happened.
Will
you
do
this?
She
will
hear
it
best
from
you."
"Immediately,"
said
Shirley,
with
docile
promptitude.
"Ought
I
to
say
that
there
is
no
danger?"
"Say
so."
"You
will
come
back
soon,
and
let
me
know
more?"
"I
will
either
come
or
write."
"Trust
me
for
watching
over
Caroline.
I
will
communicate
with
your
sister
too;
but
doubtless
she
is
already
with
Robert?"
"Doubtless,
or
will
be
soon.
Good
morning
now."
"You
will
bear
up,
come
what
may."
"We
shall
see
that."
Shirley's
fingers
were
obliged
to
withdraw
