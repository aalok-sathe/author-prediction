towards
the
cottage.
Opening
the
door,
he
spoke
a
few
words
quickly
but
quietly
to
two
females
who
ran
to
meet
him
in
the
passage.
He
calmed
the
seeming
alarm
of
one
by
a
brief
palliative
account
of
what
had
taken
place;
to
the
other
he
said,
"Go
into
the
mill,
Sarah
there
is
the
key
and
ring
the
mill
bell
as
loud
as
you
can.
Afterwards
you
will
get
another
lantern
and
help
me
to
light
up
the
front."
Returning
to
his
horses,
he
unharnessed,
fed,
and
stabled
them
with
equal
speed
and
care,
pausing
occasionally,
while
so
occupied,
as
if
to
listen
for
the
mill
bell.
It
clanged
out
presently,
with
irregular
but
loud
and
alarming
din.
The
hurried,
agitated
peal
seemed
more
urgent
than
if
the
summons
had
been
steadily
given
by
a
practised
hand.
On
that
still
night,
at
that
unusual
hour,
it
was
heard
a
long
way
round.
The
guests
in
the
kitchen
of
the
Redhouse
were
startled
by
the
clamour,
and
declaring
that
"there
must
be
summat
more
nor
common
to
do
at
Hollow's
Miln,"
they
called
for
lanterns,
and
hurried
to
the
spot
in
a
body.
And
scarcely
had
they
thronged
into
the
