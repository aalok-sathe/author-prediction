but
where
four
such
natures
as
Mr.
Hall,
David
Sweeting,
Shirley,
and
Caroline
were
assembled
in
health
and
amity,
on
a
green
lawn,
under
a
sunny
sky,
amidst
a
wilderness
of
flowers,
there
could
not
be
ungenial
dullness.
In
the
course
of
conversation
Mr.
Hall
reminded
the
ladies
that
Whitsuntide
was
approaching,
when
the
grand
united
Sunday
school
tea
drinking
and
procession
of
the
three
parishes
of
Briarfield,
Whinbury,
and
Nunnely
were
to
take
place.
Caroline,
he
knew,
would
be
at
her
post
as
teacher,
he
said,
and
he
hoped
Miss
Keeldar
would
not
be
wanting.
He
hoped
she
would
make
her
first
public
appearance
amongst
them
at
that
time.
Shirley
was
not
the
person
to
miss
an
occasion
of
this
sort.
She
liked
festive
excitement,
a
gathering
of
happiness,
a
concentration
and
combination
of
pleasant
details,
a
throng
of
glad
faces,
a
muster
of
elated
hearts.
She
told
Mr.
Hall
they
might
count
on
her
with
security.
She
did
not
know
what
she
would
have
to
do,
but
they
might
dispose
of
her
as
they
pleased.
"And,"
said
Caroline,
"you
will
promise
to
come
to
my
table,
and
to
sit
near
me,
Mr.
Hall?"
"I
shall
not
fail,
Deo
