they
were
to
be
marshalled;
till
four
they
were
to
parade
the
parish;
then
came
the
feast,
and
afterwards
the
meeting,
with
music
and
speechifying
in
the
church.
Why
Briarfield
was
chosen
for
the
point
of
rendezvous
the
scene
of
the
fete
should
be
explained.
It
was
not
because
it
was
the
largest
or
most
populous
parish
Whinbury
far
outdid
it
in
that
respect;
nor
because
it
was
the
oldest,
antique
as
were
the
hoary
church
and
rectory
Nunnely's
low
roofed
temple
and
mossy
parsonage,
buried
both
in
coeval
oaks,
outstanding
sentinels
of
Nunnwood,
were
older
still.
It
was
simply
because
Mr.
Helstone
willed
it
so,
and
Mr.
Helstone's
will
was
stronger
than
that
of
Boultby
or
Hall;
the
former
could
not,
the
latter
would
not,
dispute
a
point
of
precedence
with
their
resolute
and
imperious
brother.
They
let
him
lead
and
rule.
This
notable
anniversary
had
always
hitherto
been
a
trying
day
to
Caroline
Helstone,
because
it
dragged
her
perforce
into
public,
compelling
her
to
face
all
that
was
wealthy,
respectable,
influential
in
the
neighbourhood;
in
whose
presence,
but
for
the
kind
countenance
of
Mr.
Hall,
she
would
have
appeared
unsupported.
Obliged
to
be
conspicuous;
obliged
