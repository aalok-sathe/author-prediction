I
have
yet
a
long
night
before
me.
But
the
tea
has
made
me
strong.
I
will
sit
up."
Mrs.
Pryor
raised
her,
and
arranged
her
pillows.
"Thank
Heaven!
I
am
not
always
equally
miserable,
and
ill,
and
hopeless.
The
afternoon
has
been
bad
since
Hortense
went;
perhaps
the
evening
may
be
better.
It
is
a
fine
night,
I
think?
The
moon
shines
clear."
"Very
fine
a
perfect
summer
night.
The
old
church
tower
gleams
white
almost
as
silver."
"And
does
the
churchyard
look
peaceful?"
"Yes,
and
the
garden
also.
Dew
glistens
on
the
foliage."
"Can
you
see
many
long
weeds
and
nettles
amongst
the
graves?
or
do
they
look
turfy
and
flowery?"
"I
see
closed
daisy
heads
gleaming
like
pearls
on
some
mounds.
Thomas
has
mown
down
the
dock
leaves
and
rank
grass,
and
cleared
all
away."
"I
always
like
that
to
be
done;
it
soothes
one's
mind
to
see
the
place
in
order.
And,
I
dare
say,
within
the
church
just
now
that
moonlight
shines
as
softly
as
in
my
room.
It
will
fall
through
the
east
window
full
on
the
Helstone
monument.
When
I
close
my
eyes
I
seem
to
see
poor
papa's
epitaph
in
black
letters
