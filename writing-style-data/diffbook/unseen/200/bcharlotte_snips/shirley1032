I
know
how
far
I
may
reveal
my
feelings,
and
when
I
must
clasp
the
volume.
I
have
advanced
to
a
certain
distance,
as
far
as
the
true
and
sovereign
and
undegraded
nature
of
my
kind
permits;
now
here
I
stand
rooted.
My
heart
may
break
if
it
is
baffled;
let
it
break.
It
shall
never
dishonour
me;
it
shall
never
dishonour
my
sisterhood
in
me.
Suffering
before
degradation!
death
before
treachery!
"I,
for
my
part,
said,
'If
she
were
poor,
I
would
be
at
her
feet;
if
she
were
lowly,
I
would
take
her
in
my
arms.
Her
gold
and
her
station
are
two
griffins
that
guard
her
on
each
side.
Love
looks
and
longs,
and
dares
not;
Passion
hovers
round,
and
is
kept
at
bay;
Truth
and
Devotion
are
scared.
There
is
nothing
to
lose
in
winning
her,
no
sacrifice
to
make.
It
is
all
clear
gain,
and
therefore
unimaginably
difficult.'
"Difficult
or
not,
something
must
be
done,
something
must
be
said.
I
could
not,
and
would
not,
sit
silent
with
all
that
beauty
modestly
mute
in
my
presence.
I
spoke
thus,
and
still
I
spoke
with
calm.
Quiet
as
my
words
were,
I
could
hear
they
fell
