Seeing
now
the
state
of
matters,
and
that
it
was
desirable
to
effect
a
clearance
of
the
premises,
Shirley
stepped
in
amongst
the
gossiping
groups.
She
bade
them
good
morning
with
a
certain
frank,
tranquil
ease
the
natural
characteristic
of
her
manner
when
she
addressed
numbers,
especially
if
those
numbers
belonged
to
the
working
class;
she
was
cooler
amongst
her
equals,
and
rather
proud
to
those
above
her.
She
then
asked
them
if
they
had
all
got
their
milk
measured
out;
and
understanding
that
they
had,
she
further
observed
that
she
"wondered
what
they
were
waiting
for,
then."
"We're
just
talking
a
bit
over
this
battle
there
has
been
at
your
mill,
mistress,"
replied
a
man.
"Talking
a
bit!
Just
like
you!"
said
Shirley.
"It
is
a
queer
thing
all
the
world
is
so
fond
of
talking
over
events.
You
talk
if
anybody
dies
suddenly;
you
talk
if
a
fire
breaks
out;
you
talk
if
a
mill
owner
fails;
you
talk
if
he's
murdered.
What
good
does
your
talking
do?"
There
is
nothing
the
lower
orders
like
better
than
a
little
downright
good
humoured
rating.
Flattery
they
scorn
very
much;
honest
abuse
they
enjoy.
They
call
it
speaking
plainly,
and
