the
counting
house."
"And
the
trade?
The
cloth,
the
greasy
wool,
the
polluting
dyeing
vats?"
"The
trade
is
to
be
thoroughly
respected."
"And
the
tradesman
is
a
hero?
Good!"
"I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so.
I
thought
the
tradesman
looked
heroic."
Mischief,
spirit,
and
glee
sparkled
all
over
her
face
as
she
thus
bandied
words
with

"Captain
Keeldar,

no
mercantile
blood
in

with
a
joyous
laugh.
"It

Thank

And
waving
her
hand,
white
as
a
lily
and
fine
as
a
fairy's,
she
vanished
within
the
porch,
while
the
rector
and
his
niece
passed
out
through
the
arched
gateway.
Shirley
showed
she
had
been
sincere
in
saying
she
should
be
glad
of
Caroline's
society,
by
frequently
seeking
it;
and,
indeed,
if
she
had

sought
it,
she
would
not
have
had
it,
for
Miss
Helstone
