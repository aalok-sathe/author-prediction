mounted,
and
rode
off,
Moore
laughing
at
their
abrupt
dismissal,
Helstone
deeply
indignant
thereat.
Moore's
good
spirits
were
still
with
him
when
he
rose
next
morning.
He
and
Joe
Scott
had
both
spent
the
night
in
the
mill,
availing
themselves
of
certain
sleeping
accommodations
producible
from
recesses
in
the
front
and
back
counting
houses.
The
master,
always
an
early

Scotland,
and
happen
knaw

on't
as

and
I

to

ye'll
persevere."
"I
do."
"Is
there
mony
o'
your
mak'
i'
your

inquired
Joe,
as
he
folded
up
his
temporary
bed,
and
put
it
away.
