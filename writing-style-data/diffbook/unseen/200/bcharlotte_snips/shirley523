every
place
will
be
taken.
Provoking!"
In
fact,
Mr.
Wynne
the
magistrate,
his
wife,
his
son,
and
his
two
daughters
now
entered
in
high
state.
They
were
Briarfield
gentry.
Of
course
their
place
was
at
the
first
table,
and
being
conducted
thither,
they
filled
up
the
whole
remaining
space.
For
Miss
Keeldar's
comfort,
Mr.
Sam
Wynne
inducted
himself
into
the
very
vacancy
she
had
kept
for
Moore,
planting
himself
solidly
on
her
gown,
her
gloves,
and
her
handkerchief.
Mr.
Sam
was
one
of
the
objects
of
her
aversion,
and
the
more
so
because
he
showed
serious
symptoms
of
an
aim
at
her
hand.
The
old
gentleman,
too,
had
publicly
declared
that
the
Fieldhead
estate
and
the
De
Walden
estate
were
delightfully
contagious
a
malapropism
which
rumour
had
not
failed
to
repeat
to
Shirley.
Caroline's
ears
yet
rung
with
that
thrilling
whisper,
"I
expect
Mr.
Moore,"
her
heart
yet
beat
and
her
cheek
yet
glowed
with
it,
when
a
note
from
the
organ
pealed
above
the
confused
hum
of
the
place.
Dr.
Boultby,
Mr.
Helstone,
and
Mr.
Hall
rose,
so
did
all
present,
and
grace
was
sung
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
music;
and
then
tea
began.
She
was
kept
too
