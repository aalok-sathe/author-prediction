where
you
are."
"Let
them.
I
can
take
care
of
myself,
I
suppose."
Martin
knew
that
he
had
already
incurred
the
penalty
of
a
lecture,
and
dry
bread
for
his
tea.
No
matter;
the
evening
had
furnished
him
with
an
adventure.
It
was
better
than
muffins
and
toast.
He
walked
home
with
Caroline.
On
the
way
he
promised
to
see
Mr.
Moore,
in

cold,
stately
apartment,
seldom
used,
for
the
family
customarily
dined
in
the
back
parlour.
He
stood
before
the
mantelpiece,
and
lifted
his
candle
to
two
pictures
hung
above
female
heads:
one,
a
type
of
serene
beauty,
happy
and
innocent;
the
other,
more
lovely,
