mockery,
want,
craving,
in
that
existence
which
is
given
away
to
others,
for
want
of
something
of
your
own
to
bestow
it
on?
I
suspect
there
is.
Does
virtue
lie
in
abnegation
of
self?
I
do
not
believe
it.
Undue
humility
makes
tyranny;
weak
concession
creates
selfishness.
The
Romish
religion
especially
teaches
renunciation
of
self,
submission
to
others,
and
nowhere
are
found
so
many
grasping
tyrants
as
in
the
ranks
of
the
Romish
priesthood.
Each
human
being
has
his
share
of
rights.
I
suspect
it
would
conduce
to
the
happiness
and
welfare
of
all
if
each
knew
his
allotment,
and
held
to
it
as
tenaciously
as
the
martyr
to
his
creed.
Queer
thoughts
these
that
surge
in
my
mind.
Are
they
right
thoughts?
I
am
not
certain.
"Well,
life
is
short
at
the
best.
Seventy
years,
they
say,
pass
like
a
vapour,
like
a
dream
when
one
awaketh;
and
every
path
trod
by
human
feet
terminates
in
one
bourne
the
grave,
the
little
chink
in
the
surface
of
this
great
globe,
the
furrow
where
the
mighty
husbandman
with
the
scythe
deposits
the
seed
he
has
shaken
from
the
ripe
stem;
and
there
it
falls,
decays,
and
thence
it
springs
again,
