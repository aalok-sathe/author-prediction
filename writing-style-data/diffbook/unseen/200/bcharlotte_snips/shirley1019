Hortense;
come
near,
a
little
nearer,
my
own
Lina.
I
care
for
the
whisper
more
than
the
words."
She
whispered.
Robert
gave
a
start,
a
flash
of
the
eye,
a
brief
laugh.
Miss
Moore
entered,
and
Sarah
followed
behind,
with
information
that
Fanny
was
come.
The
hour

petulant.
"Only
give

word,
and
I'll

"But
