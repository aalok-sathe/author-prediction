twice
happened
to
be
in
the
room
when
Miss
Mann
had
made
a
call
on
his
sister,
and
after
listening
to
her
conversation
and
viewing
her
features
for
a
time,
he
had
gone
out
into
the
garden
where
his
little
cousin
was
tending
some
of
his
favourite
flowers,
and
while
standing
near
and
watching
her
he
had
amused
himself
with
comparing
fair
youth,
delicate
and
attractive,
with
shrivelled
eld,
livid
and
loveless,
and
in
jestingly
repeating
to
a
smiling
girl

Once
on
such
an
occasion
Caroline
had
said
to
him,
looking
up
from
the
luxuriant
creeper
she
was
binding
to
its
frame,
"Ah!
Robert,
you
do
not
like
old
maids.
I,
too,
should
come
under
the
lash
of
your
sarcasm
if
I
were
an
old
maid."
"You
an
old
maid!"
he
had
replied.
"A
piquant
notion
suggested
by
lips
of
that
tint
and
form.
I
can
fancy
you,
though,
at
forty,
quietly
dressed,
pale
and
sunk,
but
still
with
that
straight
nose,
white
forehead,
and
those
soft
eyes.
I
suppose,
too,
you
will
keep
your
voice,
which
has
another
'timbre'
than
that
hard,
deep
organ
of
Miss
Mann's.
Courage,
Cary!
