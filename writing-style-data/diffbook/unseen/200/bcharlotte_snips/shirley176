die,
and
you
will
have
learned
the
great
lesson
how
to
endure
without
a
sob.
For
the
whole
remnant
of
your
life,
if
you
survive
the
test
some,
it
is
said,
die
under
it
you
will
be
stronger,
wiser,
less
sensitive.
This
you
are
not
aware
of,
perhaps,
at
the
time,
and
so
cannot
borrow
courage
of
that
hope.
Nature,
however,
as
has
been
intimated,
is
an
excellent
friend
in
such
cases,
sealing
the
lips,
interdicting
utterance,
commanding
a
placid
dissimulation
a
dissimulation
often
wearing
an
easy
and
gay
mien
at
first,
settling
down
to
sorrow
and
paleness
in
time,
then
passing
away,
and
leaving
a
convenient
stoicism,
not
the
less
fortifying
because
it
is
half
bitter.
Half
bitter!
Is
that
wrong?
No;
it
should
be
bitter:
bitterness
is
strength
it
is
a
tonic.
Sweet,
mild
force
following
acute
suffering
you
find
nowhere;
to
talk
of
it
is
delusion.
There
may
be
apathetic
exhaustion
after
the
rack.
If
energy
remains,
it
will
be
rather
a
dangerous
energy
deadly
when
confronted
with
injustice.
Who
has
read
the
ballad
of
"Puir
Mary
Lee"
that
old
Scotch
ballad,
written
I
know
not
in
what
generation
nor
by
what
hand?
Mary
