they
hated
the
manufacturers

buildings.
In
the
parish
of
Briarfield,
with
which
we
have
at
present
to
do,
Hollow's
Mill
was
the
place
held
most
abominable;
Gerard
Moore,
in
his
double
character
of
semi
foreigner
and
thorough
going
progressist,
the
man
most
abominated.
And
it
perhaps
rather
agreed
with
Moore's
temperament
than
otherwise
to
be
generally
hated,
especially
when
he
believed
the
thing
for
which
he
was
hated
a
right
and
an
expedient
thing;
and
it
was
with
a
sense
of
warlike
excitement
he,
on
this
night,
sat
in
his
counting
house
waiting
the
arrival
of
his
frame
laden
wagons.
Malone's
coming
and
company
were,
it
may
be,
most
unwelcome

He
would
have
preferred
sitting
alone;
for
he
liked
a
silent,
sombre,
unsafe
solitude.
His
watchman's
musket
would
have
been
company
enough
for
him;
the
full
flowing
beck
in
the
den
would
have
delivered
continuously
the
discourse
most
genial
to
his
ear.
With
the
queerest
look
in
the
world
had
the
manufacturer
for
some
ten
minutes
been
watching
the
Irish
curate,
as
the
latter
made
free
with
the
punch,
when
suddenly
that
steady
gray
eye
changed,
as
if
another
vision
came
between
it
and
