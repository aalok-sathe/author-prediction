Mill
from
far
and
near;
and
Joe
Scott
shall
give
them
work,
and
Louis
Moore,
Esq.,
shall
let
them
a
tenement,
and
Mrs.
Gill
shall
mete
them
a
portion
till
the
first
pay
day."
She
smiled
up
in
his
face.
"Such
a
Sunday
school
as
you
will
have,
Cary!
such
collections
as
you
will
get!
such
a
day
school
as
you
and
Shirley
and
Miss
Ainley
will
have
to
manage
between
you!
The
mill
shall
find
salaries
for
a
master
and
mistress,
and
the
squire
or
the
clothier
shall
give
a
treat
once
a
quarter."

offer

extortion

about

kisses.
"Extravagant
day
dreams,"
said
Moore,
with
a
sigh
and

"yet
perhaps
we
may
realize
some
of
them.
Meantime,
the
dew
is
falling.
Mrs.
Moore,
I
shall
take
you
in."
It
is
August.
The
bells
clash
out
again,
not
only
through
Yorkshire,
but
through
England.
From
Spain
the
voice
of
a
trumpet
has
sounded
long;
it
now
waxes
louder
and
louder;
it
proclaims
Salamanca
won.
This
night
is
Briarfield
to
be
illuminated.
On
this
day
the
Fieldhead
tenantry
dine
together;
the
Hollow's
Mill
workpeople
will
