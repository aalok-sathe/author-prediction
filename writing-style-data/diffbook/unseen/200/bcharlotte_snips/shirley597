that
God
had
turned
His
face
from
her.
At
moments
she
was
a
Calvinist,
and,
sinking
into
the
gulf
of
religious
despair,
she
saw
darkening
over
her
the
doom
of
reprobation.
Most
people
have
had
a
period
or
periods
in
their
lives
when
they
have
felt
thus
forsaken
when,
having
long
hoped
against
hope,
and
still
seen
the
day
of
fruition
deferred,
their
hearts
have
truly
sickened
within
them.
This
is
a
terrible
hour,
but
it
is
often
that
darkest
point
which
precedes
the
rise
of
day
that
turn
of
the
year
when
the
icy
January
wind
carries
over
the
waste
at
once
the
dirge
of
departing
winter
and
the
prophecy
of
coming
spring.
The
perishing
birds,
however,
cannot
thus
understand
the
blast
before
which
they
shiver;
and
as
little
can
the
suffering
soul
recognize,
in
the
climax
of
its
affliction,
the
dawn
of
its
deliverance.
Yet,
let
whoever
grieves
still
cling
fast
to
love
and
faith
in
God.
God
will
never
deceive,
never
finally
desert
him.
"Whom
He
loveth,
He
chasteneth."
These
words
are
true,
and
should
not
be
forgotten.
The
household
was
astir
at
last;
the
servants
were
up;
the
shutters
were
opened
below.
