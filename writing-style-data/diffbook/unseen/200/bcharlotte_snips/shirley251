she
agreed
perfectly
well,
yet
he
was
naturally
a
social,
hospitable
man,
an
advocate
for
family
unity;
and
in
his
youth,
as
has
been
said,
he
liked
none
but
lively,
cheerful
women.
Why
he
chose
her,
how
they
contrived
to
suit
each
other,
is
a
problem
puzzling
enough,
but
which
might
soon
be
solved
if
one
had
time
to
go
into
the
analysis
of
the
case.
Suffice
it
here
to
say
that
Yorke
had
a
shadowy
side
as
well
as
a
sunny
side
to
his
character,
and
that
his
shadowy
side
found
sympathy
and
affinity
in
the
whole
of
his
wife's
uniformly
overcast
nature.
For
the
rest,
she
was
a
strong
minded
woman;
never
said
a
weak
or
a
trite
thing;
took
stern,
democratic
views
of
society,
and
rather
cynical
ones
of
human
nature;
considered
herself
perfect
and
safe,
and
the
rest
of
the
world
all
wrong.
Her
main
fault
was
a
brooding,
eternal,
immitigable
suspicion
of
all
men,
things,
creeds,
and
parties;
this
suspicion
was
a
mist
before
her
eyes,
a
false
guide
in
her
path,
wherever
she
looked,
wherever
she
turned.
It
may
be
supposed
that
the
children
of
such
a
pair
were
not
likely
to
turn
out
