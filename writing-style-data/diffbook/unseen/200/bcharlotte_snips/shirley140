he
will
take
his
boots
off
when
he
comes
in.
I
hear
him;
he
is
coming."
"Miss,
you
are
cutting
the
stuff
wrong."
"So
I
am;
but
it
is
only
a
snip.
There
is
no
harm
done."
The
kitchen
door
opened;
Mr.
Moore
entered,
very
wet
and
cold.
Caroline
half
turned
from
her
dressmaking
occupation,
but
renewed
it
for
a
moment,
as
if
to
gain
a
minute's
time

Bent
over
the
dress,
her
face
was
hidden;
there
was
an
attempt

would

to
return

You
expected

"No,

I
dared
not
when
it
rained
so
fast.
And
you
are
wet
and
chilled.
Change
everything.
If
you
took
cold,
I
should
we
should
blame
ourselves
in
some
measure."
"I
am
not
wet
through:
my
riding
coat
is
waterproof.
Dry
shoes
are
all
I
require.
There
the
fire
is
pleasant
after
facing
the
cold
wind
and
rain
for
a
few
miles."

the
kitchen
hearth;
