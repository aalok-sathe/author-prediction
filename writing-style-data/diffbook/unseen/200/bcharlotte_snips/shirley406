painful
step?"
"My
dear,"
said
Mrs.
Pryor,
"you
are
very
young
to
be
a
governess,
and
not
sufficiently
robust.
The
duties
a
governess
undertakes
are
often
severe."
"And
I
believe
I
want
severe
duties
to
occupy
me."
"Occupy
you!"
cried
Shirley.
"When
are
you
idle?
I
never
saw
a
more
industrious
girl
than
you.
You
are
always
at
work.
Come,"
she
continued
"come
and
sit
by
my
side,
and
take
some
tea
to
refresh
you.
You
don't
care
much
for
my
friendship,

you
wish
to
leave
me?"
"Indeed
I

Shirley;
and
I
don't
wish
to
leave
you.
I
shall
never
find
another
friend
so
dear."
At
which
words
Miss
Keeldar
put
her
hand
into
Caroline's
with
an
impulsively
affectionate
movement,
which
was
well
seconded
by
the
expression
of
her
face.
"If
you
think
so,
you
had
better
make
much
of
me,"
she
said,
"and
not
run
away
from
me.
I
hate
to
part
with
those
to
whom
I
am
become
attached.
Mrs.
Pryor
there
sometimes
talks
of
leaving
me,
and
says
I
might
make
a
more
advantageous
connection
than
herself.
I
should
as
soon
think
of
exchanging
an
old
fashioned
mother
for
something
modish
and
stylish.
