and
thirdly,
he
had
too
little
of
the
organs
of
benevolence
and
ideality,
which
took
the
glory
and
softness
from
his
nature,
and
for
him
diminished
those
divine
qualities
throughout
the
universe.
The
want
of
veneration
made
him
intolerant
to
those
above
him
kings
and
nobles
and
priests,
dynasties
and
parliaments
and
establishments,
with
all
their
doings,
most
of
their
enactments,
their
forms,
their
rights,
their
claims,
were
to
him
an
abomination,
all

of
admiring
what
is
admirable;
it
dried
up
a
thousand
pure
sources
of
enjoyment;
it
withered
a
thousand
vivid
pleasures.
He
was
not
irreligious,
though
a
member
of
no
sect;
but
his
religion
could
not
be
that
of
one
who
knows
how
to
venerate.
He
believed
in
God
and
heaven;
but
his
God
and
heaven
were
those
of
a
man
in
whom
awe,
imagination,
and
tenderness
lack.
The
weakness
of
his
powers
of
comparison
made
him
inconsistent;
