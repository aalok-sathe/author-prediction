Her
gaze
said,
"This
woman
is
not
of
mine
or
my
daughters'
kind.
I
object
to
her
as
my
son's
wife."
Her
son,
catching
the
look,
read
its
meaning.
He
grew
alarmed.
What
he
so
wished
to
win
there
was
danger
he
might
lose.
He
must
make
haste.
The
room
they
were
in
had
once
been
a
picture
gallery.
Sir
Philip's
father
Sir
Monckton
had
converted
it
into
a
saloon;
but
still
it
had
a
shadowy,
long
withdrawing
look.
A
deep
recess
with
a
window
a
recess
that
held
one
couch,
one
table,
and
a
fairy
cabinet
formed
a
room
within
a
room.
Two
persons
standing
there
might
interchange
a
dialogue,
and,
so
it
were
neither
long
nor
loud,
none
be
the
wiser.
Sir
Philip
induced
two
of
his
sisters
to
perpetrate
a
duet.
He
gave
occupation
to
the
Misses
Sympson.
The
elder
ladies
were
conversing
together.
He
was
pleased
to
remark
that
meantime
Shirley
rose
to
look
at
the
pictures.
He
had
a
tale
to
tell
about
one
ancestress,
whose
dark
beauty
seemed
as
that
of
a
flower
of
the
south.
He
joined
her,
and
began
to
tell
it.
There
were
mementoes
of
the
same
lady
in
the
cabinet
