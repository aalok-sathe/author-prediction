me
words
one
night;
it
poured
a
strain
which
I
could
have
written
down,
only
I
was
appalled,
and
dared
not
rise
to
seek
pencil
and
paper
by
the
dim
watch
light.
"What
is
that
electricity
they
speak
of,
whose
changes
make
us
well
or
ill,
whose
lack
or
excess
blasts,
whose
even
balance
revives?
What
are
all
those
influences
that
are
about
us
in
the
atmosphere,
that
keep
playing
over
our
nerves
like
fingers
on
stringed
instruments,
and
call
forth
now
a
sweet
note,
and
now
a
wail
now
an
exultant
swell,
and
anon
the
saddest
cadence?
"Where
is
the
other
world?
In
what
will
another
life
consist?
Why
do
I
ask?
Have
I
not
cause
to
think
that
the
hour
is
hasting
but
too
fast
when
the
veil
must
be
rent
for
me?
Do
I
not
know
the
Grand
Mystery
is
likely
to
burst
prematurely
on
me?
Great
Spirit,
in
whose
goodness
I
confide,
whom,
as
my
Father,
I
have
petitioned
night
and
morning
from
early
infancy,
help
the
weak
creation
of
Thy
hands!
Sustain
me
through
the
ordeal
I
dread
and
must
undergo!
Give
me
strength!
Give
me
patience!
Give
me
oh,
give
me
FAITH!"
She
