me
the
hour.
Won't
I
walk
into
that
goose?
and
we'll
try
whether
Matthew
or
I
shall
get
the
largest
cut
of
the
apple
pie
to
day."
Martin
had
planned
well.
He
had
laid
out
a
dexterously
concerted
scheme
for
his
private
amusement.
But
older
and
wiser
schemers
than
he
are
often
doomed
to
see
their
finest
spun
projects
swept
to
annihilation
by
the
sudden
broom
of
Fate,
that
fell
housewife
whose
red
arm
none
can
control.
In
the
present
instance
this
broom
was
manufactured
out
of
the
tough
fibres
of
Moore's
own
stubborn
purpose,
bound
tight
with
his
will.
He
was
now
resuming
his
strength,
and
making
strange
head
against
Mrs.
Horsfall.
Each
morning
he
amazed
that
matron
with
a
fresh
astonishment.
First
he
discharged
her
from
her
valet
duties;
he
would
dress
himself.
Then
he
refused
the
coffee
she
brought
him;
he
would
breakfast
with
the
family.
Lastly,
he
forbade
her
his
chamber.
On
the
same
day,
amidst
the
outcries
of
all
the
women
in
the
place,
he
put
his
head
out
of
doors.
The
morning
after,
he
followed
Mr.
Yorke
to
his
counting
house,
and
requested
an
envoy
to
fetch
a
chaise
from
the
Red
House
Inn.
