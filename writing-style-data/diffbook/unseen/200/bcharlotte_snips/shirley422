her
pupil;
yet
she
reproaches
you
sometimes
for
obeying
your
uncle's
injunctions
too
literally.
Affection,
like
love,
will
be
unjust
now
and
then."
And
Caroline
made
no
answer
to
this
observation;
for
indeed
her
heart
was
troubled,
and
to
her
eyes
she
would
have
raised
her
handkerchief
if
she
had
dared.
If
she
had
dared,
too,
she
would
have
declared
how
the
very
flowers
in
the
garden
of
Hollow's
Cottage
were
dear

this
proximity
had
been
hers
long
since
his
voice
had
addressed
her;
could
she,
with
any
show
of
probability,
even
of
possibility,
have
imagined
that
the
meeting
gave
him
pleasure,
to
her
it
would
have
given
deep
bliss.
Yet,
even
in
doubt
that
it
pleased,
in
dread
that
it
might
annoy
him,
she
received
the
boon
of
the
meeting
as
an
imprisoned
bird
