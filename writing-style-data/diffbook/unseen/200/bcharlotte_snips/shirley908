five
years
ago
I
tried
to
persuade
a
beautiful
woman
to
love
me,
and
she
would
not.
I
had
not
the
key
to
her
nature;
she
was
a
stone
wall
to
me,
doorless
and
windowless."
"But
you
loved
her,
Yorke;
you
worshipped
Mary
Cave.
Your
conduct,
after
all,
was
that
of
a
man
never
of
a
fortune
hunter."
"Ay,
I
did
love
her;
but
then
she
was
beautiful
as
the
moon
we
do
not
see
to
night.
There
is
naught
like
her
in
these
days.
Miss
Helstone,
maybe,
has
a
look
of
her,
but
nobody
else."
"Who
has
a
look
of
her?"
"That
black
coated
tyrant's
niece
that
quiet,
delicate
Miss
Helstone.
Many
a
time
I
have
put
on
my
spectacles
to
look
at
the
lassie
in
church,
because
she
has
gentle
blue
een,
wi'
long
lashes;
and
when
she
sits
in
shadow,
and
is
very
still
and
very
pale,
and
is,
happen,
about
to
fall
asleep
wi'
the
length
of
the
sermon
and
the
heat
of
the
biggin',
she
is
as
like
one
of
Canova's
marbles
as
aught
else."
"Was
Mary
Cave
in
that
style?"
"Far
grander!
less
lass
like
and
flesh
like.
You
wondered
why
she
hadn't
wings
