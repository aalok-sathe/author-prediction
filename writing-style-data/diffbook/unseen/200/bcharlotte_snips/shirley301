when
the
world
has
rolled
round
a
few
times
more.
So
much
for
the
body.
The
soul
meantime
wings
its
long
flight
upward,
folds
its
wings
on
the
brink
of
the
sea
of
fire
and
glass,
and
gazing
down
through
the
burning
clearness,
finds
there
mirrored
the
vision
of
the
Christian's
triple
Godhead
the
sovereign
Father,
the
mediating
Son,
the
Creator
Spirit.

talking
inwardly
in
the
same
strain
looking
forwards,
asking
what
she
was
to
do
with
life.
Fanny,
as
she
passed
in
and
out
of
the
room
occasionally,
intent
on
housemaid
errands,
perceived
that
her
young
mistress
sat
very
still.
She
was
always
in
the
same
place,
always
bent
industriously
over
a
piece
of
work.
She
did
not
lift
her
head
to
speak
