Shirley
could
easily
and
quickly
cement
an
acquaintance.
She
walked
and
talked
with
Sir
Philip;
she,
her
aunt,
and
cousins
sometimes
took
a
sail
in
his
yacht.
She
liked
him
because
she
found
him
kind
and
modest,
and
was
charmed
to
feel
she
had
the
power
to
amuse
him.
One
slight
drawback
there
was
where
is
the
friendship
without
it?
Sir
Philip
had
a
literary
turn.
He
wrote
poetry
sonnets,
stanzas,
ballads.
Perhaps
Miss
Keeldar
thought
him
a
little
too
fond
of
reading
and
reciting
these
compositions;
perhaps
she
wished
the
rhyme
had
possessed
more
accuracy,
the
measure
more
music,
the
tropes
more
freshness,
the
inspiration
more
fire.
At
any
rate,
she
always
winced
when
he
recurred
to
the
subject
of
his
poems,
and
usually
did
her
best
to
divert
the
conversation
into
another
channel.
He
would
beguile
her
to
take
moonlight
walks
with
him
on
the
bridge,
for
the
sole
purpose,
as
it
seemed,
of
pouring
into
her
ear
the
longest
of
his
ballads.
He
would
lead
her
away
to
sequestered
rustic
seats,
whence
the
rush
of
the
surf
to
the
sands
was
heard
soft
and
soothing;
and
when
he
had
her
all
to
himself,
and
the
sea
lay
