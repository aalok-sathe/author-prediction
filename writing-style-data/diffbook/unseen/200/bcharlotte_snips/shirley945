near
her
door
a
half
murdered
man
in
her
best
bed
set
her
straight,
cheered
her
spirits,
gave
her
cap
the
dash
of
a
turban.
Mrs.
Yorke
was
just
the
woman
who,
while
rendering
miserable
the
drudging
life
of
a
simple
maid
servant,
would
nurse
like
a
heroine
a
hospital
full
of
plague
patients.
She
almost
loved
Moore.
Her
tough
heart
almost
yearned
towards
him
when
she
found
him
committed
to
her
charge
left
in
her
arms,
as
dependent
on
her
as
her
youngest
born
in
the
cradle.
Had
she
seen
a
domestic
or
one
of
her
daughters
give
him
a
draught
of
water
or
smooth
his
pillow,
she
would
have
boxed
the
intruder's
ears.
She
chased
Jessie
and
Rose
from
the
upper
realm
of
the
house;
she
forbade
the
housemaids
to
set
their
foot
in
it.
Now,
if
the
accident
had
happened
at
the
rectory
gates,
and
old
Helstone
had
taken
in
the
martyr,
neither
Yorke
nor
his
wife
would
have
pitied
him.
They
would
have
adjudged
him
right
served
for
his
tyranny
and
meddling.
As
it
was,
he
became,
for
the
present,
the
apple
of
their
eye.
Strange!
