was
careful
not
to
put
in
practice
her
own
theory.
Much
as
she
liked
an
evening
visit
to
the
cottage,
she
never
paid
one
unasked.
Often,
indeed,
when
pressed
by
Hortense
to
come,
she
would
refuse,
because
Robert
did
not
second,
or
but
slightly
seconded
the
request.
This
morning
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever,
of
his
own
unprompted
will,
given
her
an
invitation;
and
then
he
had
spoken
so
kindly
that
in
hearing
him
she
had
received
a
sense
of
happiness
sufficient
to
keep
her
glad
for
the
whole
day.
The
morning
passed
as
usual.
Mademoiselle,
ever
breathlessly
busy,
spent
it
in
bustling
from
kitchen
to
parlour,
now
scolding
Sarah,
now
looking
over
Caroline's
exercise
or
hearing
her
repetition
lesson.
However
faultlessly
these
tasks
were
achieved,
she
never
commended:
it
was
a
maxim
with
her
that
praise
is
inconsistent
with
a
teacher's
dignity,
and
that
blame,
in
more
or
less
unqualified
measure,
is
indispensable
to
it.
She
thought
incessant
reprimand,
severe
or
slight,
quite
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
her
authority;
and
if
no
possible
error
was
to
be
found
in
the
lesson,
it
was
the
pupil's
carriage,
or
air,
or
dress,
or
mien,
which
required
correction.
