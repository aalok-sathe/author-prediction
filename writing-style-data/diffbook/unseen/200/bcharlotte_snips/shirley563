'It
is
permitted
to
a
woman
to
teach
and
to
exercise
authority
as
much
as
may
be.
Man,
meantime,
cannot
do
better
than
hold
his
peace;'
and
so
on."
"That
willn't
wash,
miss."
"I
dare
say
it
will.
My
notions
are
dyed
in
faster
colours
than
yours,
Joe.
Mr.
Scott,
you
are
a
thoroughly
dogmatical
person,
and
always
were.
I
like
William
better
than
you."
"Joe
is
well
enough
in
his
own
house,"
said
Shirley.
"I
have
seen
him
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
at
home.
There
is
not
a
better
nor
a
kinder
husband
in
Briarfield.
He
does
not
dogmatize
to
his
wife."
"My
wife
is
a
hard
working,
plain
woman;
time
and
trouble
has
ta'en
all
the
conceit
out
of
her.
But
that
is
not
the
case
with
you,
young
misses.
And
then
you
reckon
to
have
so
much
knowledge;
and
i'
my
thoughts
it's
only
superficial
sort
o'
vanities
you're
acquainted
with.
I
can
tell
happen
a
year
sin'
one
day
Miss
Caroline
coming
into
our
counting
house
when
I
war
packing
up
summat
behind
t'
great
desk,
and
she
didn't
see
me,
and
she
brought
a
slate
wi'
a
sum
on
it
