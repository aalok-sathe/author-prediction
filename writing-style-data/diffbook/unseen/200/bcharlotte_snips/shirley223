Helstone,
with
a
self
satisfied
simper
on
his
lips
and
a
regretful
glisten
in
his
eye.
Moore
looked
as
if
he
should
have
liked
to
fool
him
to
the
top
of
his
bent.
What
would
a
certain
young
kinswoman
of
his
have
said
could
she
have
seen
her
dear,
good,
great
Robert
her
Coriolanus
just
now?
Would
she
have
acknowledged
in
that
mischievous,
sardonic
visage
the
same
face
to
which
she
had
looked
up
with
such
love,
which
had
bent
over
her
with
such
gentleness
last
night?
Was
that
the
man
who
had
spent
so
quiet
an
evening
with
his
sister
and
his
cousin
so
suave
to
one,
so
tender
to
the
other
reading
Shakespeare
and
listening
to
Chenier?
Yes,
it
was
the
same
man,
only
seen
on
a
different
side
a
side
Caroline
had
not
yet
fairly
beheld,
though
perhaps
she
had
enough
sagacity
faintly
to
suspect
its
existence.
Well,
Caroline
had,
doubtless,
her
defective
side
too.
She
was
human.
She
must,
then,
have
been
very
imperfect;
and
had
she
seen
Moore
on
his
very
worst
side,
she
would
probably
have
said
this
to
herself
and
excused
him.
Love
can
excuse
anything
except
meanness;
but
meanness
kills
love,
cripples
