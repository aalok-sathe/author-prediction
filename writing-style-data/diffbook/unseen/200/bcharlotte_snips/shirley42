was
unapt
to
attach
himself
to
parties,
to
sects,
even
to
climes
and
customs;
it
is
not
impossible
that
he
had
a
tendency
to
isolate
his
individual
person
from
any
community
amidst
which
his
lot
might
temporarily
happen
to
be
thrown,
and
that
he
felt
it
to
be
his
best
wisdom
to
push
the
interests
of
Robert
Gerard
Moore,
to
the
exclusion
of
philanthropic
consideration
for
general
interests,
with
which
he
regarded
the
said
Gerard
Moore
as
in
a
great
measure
disconnected.
Trade
was
Mr.
Moore's
hereditary
calling:
the
Gerards
of
Antwerp
had
been
merchants
for
two
centuries
back.
Once
they
had
been
wealthy
merchants;
but
the
uncertainties,
the
involvements,
of
business
had
come
upon
them;
disastrous
speculations
had
loosened
by
degrees
the
foundations
of
their
credit.
The
house
had
stood
on
a
tottering
base
for
a
dozen
years;
and
at
last,
in
the
shock
of
the
French
Revolution,
it
had
rushed
down
a
total
ruin.
In
its
fall
was
involved
the
English
and
Yorkshire
firm
of
Moore,
closely
connected
with
the
Antwerp
house,
and
of
which
one
of
the
partners,
resident
in
Antwerp,
Robert
Moore,
had
married
Hortense
Gerard,
with
the
prospect
of
his
bride
inheriting
her
father
Constantine
