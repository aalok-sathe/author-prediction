all
night;
the
effect
of
the
terrible
drama
which
had
just
been
enacted
before
her
eyes
was
not
likely
to
quit
her
for
days.
It
was
vain
even
to
try
to
retain
a
recumbent
posture;
she
sat
up
by
Shirley's
side,
counting
the
slow
minutes,
and
watching
the
June
sun
mount
the
heavens.
Life
wastes
fast
in
such
vigils
as
Caroline
had
of
late
but
too
often
kept
vigils
during
which
the
mind,
having
no
pleasant
food
to
nourish
it,
no
manna
of
hope,
no
hived
honey
of
joyous
memories,
tries
to
live
on
the
meagre
diet
of
wishes,
and
failing
to
derive
thence
either
delight
or
support,
and
feeling
itself
ready
to
perish
with
craving
want,
turns
to
philosophy,
to
resolution,
to
resignation;
calls
on
all
these
gods
for
aid,
calls
vainly
is
unheard,
unhelped,
and
languishes.
Caroline
was
a
Christian;
therefore
in
trouble
she
framed
many
a
prayer
after
the
Christian
creed,
preferred
it
with
deep
earnestness,
begged
for
patience,
strength,
relief.
This
world,
however,
we
all
know,
is
the
scene
of
trial
and
probation;
and,
for
any
favourable
result
her
petitions
had
yet
wrought,
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
were
unheard
and
unaccepted.
She
believed,
sometimes,
