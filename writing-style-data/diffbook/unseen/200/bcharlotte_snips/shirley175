least
something
like
a
kind
pressure;
it
was
difficult
to
turn
her
eyes
from
his
eyes,
till
his
looks
had
expressed
something
more
and
fonder
than
that
cool
welcome.
A
lover
masculine
so
disappointed
can
speak
and
urge
explanation,
a
lover
feminine
can
say
nothing;
if
she
did,
the
result
would
be
shame
and
anguish,
inward
remorse
for
self
treachery.
Nature
would
brand
such
demonstration
as
a
rebellion
against
her
instincts,
and
would
vindictively
repay
it
afterwards
by
the
thunderbolt
of
self
contempt
smiting
suddenly
in
secret.
Take
the
matter
as
you
find
it:
ask
no
questions,
utter
no
remonstrances;
it
is
your
best
wisdom.
You
expected
bread,
and
you
have
got
a
stone:
break
your
teeth
on
it,
and
don't
shriek
because
the
nerves
are
martyrized;
do
not
doubt
that
your
mental
stomach
if
you
have
such
a
thing
is
strong
as
an
ostrich's;
the
stone
will
digest.
You
held
out
your
hand
for
an
egg,
and
fate
put
into
it
a
scorpion.
Show
no
consternation:
close
your
fingers
firmly
upon
the
gift;
let
it
sting
through
your
palm.
Never
mind;
in
time,
after
your
hand
and
arm
have
swelled
and
quivered
long
with
torture,
the
squeezed
scorpion
will
