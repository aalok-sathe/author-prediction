Jacobinical."
"Very
well,"
said
Caroline
quietly.
She
acquiesced
then.
There
was
no
vexed
flushing
of
the
face,
no
gathering
tears;
the
shadowy
thoughtfulness
which
had
covered
her
features
ere
Mr.
Helstone
spoke
remained
undisturbed;
she
was
obedient.
Yes,
perfectly;
because
the
mandate
coincided
with
her
own
previous
judgment;
because
it
was
now
become
pain
to
her
to
go
to
Hollow's
Cottage;
nothing
met
her
there

disappointment.
Hope
and
love
had
quitted
that
little
tenement,
for
Robert
seemed
to
have
deserted
its

Whenever

in
the
house;
he
lived
in
the
counting
house.
At
church
only
Caroline
had
the
chance
of
seeing
him,
and
there
she
rarely
looked
at
him.
It
was
both
too
much
pain
and
too
much
pleasure
to
look
it
excited
too
much
emotion;
and
that
it
was
all
wasted
emotion

had
learned
