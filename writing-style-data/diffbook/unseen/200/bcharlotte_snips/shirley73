would
have
termed
it
characteristic;
shrewd
people
would
have
delighted
in
it
for
the
pith,
sagacity,
intelligence,
the
rude
yet
real
originality
marked
in
every
lineament,
latent
in
every
furrow.
But
it
was
an
indocile,
a
scornful,
and
a
sarcastic
face
the
face
of
a
man
difficult
to
lead,
and
impossible
to
drive.
His
stature
was
rather
tall,
and
he
was
well
made
and
wiry,
and
had
a
stately
integrity
of
port;
there
was

I
did
not
find

easy
to

or
even

and
with
some
good
feeling
to
Mr.
Moore,
but
you
are
not
thence
to
conclude
that
he
always
spoke
and
thought
justly
and
kindly.
Mr.
Yorke,
in
the
first
place,
was
without
the
organ
of
veneration
a
great
want,
and
which
throws
a
man
wrong
on
every
point
where
veneration
is
required.
Secondly,
he
was
without
the
organ
of
comparison
a
deficiency
which
strips
a
man
of
sympathy;
