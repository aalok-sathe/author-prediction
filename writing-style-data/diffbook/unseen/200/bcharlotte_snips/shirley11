the
signification
of
such
words
as
vele,
firrum,
hellum,
storrum
(so
Mr.
Malone
invariably
pronounced
veil,
firm,
helm,
storm),
and
employing
such
other
methods
of
retaliation
as
the
innate
refinement
of
their
minds
suggested.
This,
of
course,
would
not
do.
Malone,
being
neither
good
natured
nor
phlegmatic,
was
presently
in
a
towering
passion.
He
vociferated,
gesticulated;
Donne
and
Sweeting
laughed.
He
reviled
them
as
Saxons

that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gale
did
not
take
alarm
at
the
noise,
and
send
for
a
constable
to
keep
the
peace.
But
they
were
accustomed
to
such
demonstrations;
they
well
knew
that
the
curates

without
a
little
exercise
of
the

these
clerical
quarrels
