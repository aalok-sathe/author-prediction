had
long
since
lit
the
kitchen
fire,
or
curled
the
maid's
hair
at
Sympson
Grove.
What
made
you
keep
them,
Henry?"
"It
is
not
my
doing.
I
should
not
have
thought
of
it.
It
never
entered
my
head
to
suppose
copy
books
of
value.
Mr.
Moore
put
them
by
in
the
inner
drawer
of
his
desk.
Perhaps
he
forgot
them."
"C'est
cela.
He
forgot
them,
no
doubt,"
echoed
Shirley.
"They
are
extremely
well
written,"
she
observed
complacently.
"What
a
giddy
girl
you
were,
Shirley,
in
those
days!
I
remember
you
so
well.
A
slim,
light
creature
whom,
though
you
were
so
tall,
I
could
lift
off
the
floor.
I
see
you
with
your
long,
countless
curls
on
your
shoulders,
and
your
streaming
sash.
You
used
to
make
Mr.
Moore
lively
that
is,
at
first.
I
believe
you
grieved
him
after
a
while."
Shirley
turned
the
closely
written
pages
and
said
nothing.
Presently
she
observed,
"That
was
written
one
winter
afternoon.
It
was
a
description
of
a
snow
scene."
"I
remember,"
said
Henry.
"Mr.
Moore,
when
he
read
it,
cried,
'Voila
le
Francais
gagne!'
He
said
it
was
well
done.
Afterwards
you
made
him
draw,
in
sepia,
the
landscape
you
described."
