at
every
turn
still
in
every
vestry
meeting
and
justice
meeting
where
we
encountered
one
another."
"It
is
just
what
I
should
expect
of
you,
Mr.
Yorke."
"Does
it
agree
wi'
ye
now,
Mr.
Helstone,
to
be
riding
out
after
rioters,
of
a
wet
night,
at
your
age?"
"It
always
agrees
with
me
to
be
doing
my
duty;
and
in
this
case
my
duty
is
a
thorough
pleasure.
To
hunt
down
vermin
is
a
noble
occupation,
fit
for
an
archbishop."
"Fit
for
ye,
at
ony
rate.
But
where's
t'
curate?

happen
gone
to
visit
some
poor
body
in
a
sick
gird,
or
he's
happen
hunting
down
vermin
in
another
direction."
"He
is
doing
garrison
duty
at
Hollow's
Mill."
"You
left
him
a
sup
o'
wine,
I
hope,
Bob"
(turning
to
Mr.
Moore),
"to
keep
his
courage
up?"
He
did
not
pause
for
an
answer,
but
continued,
quickly,
still
addressing
Moore,
who
had
thrown
himself
into
an
old
fashioned
chair
by
the
fireside
"Move
it,
Robert!
Get
up,
my
lad!
That
place
is
mine.
Take
the
sofa,
or
three
other
chairs,
if
you
will,
but
not
this.
It
belangs
to
me,
and
nob'dy
else."
"Why
are
you
so
particular
