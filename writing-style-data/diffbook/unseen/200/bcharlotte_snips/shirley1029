the
bosom
of
the
Sympson
family
for
ever.
Happily
this
change
does
not
leave
me
stranded;
it
but
hurries
into
premature
execution
designs
long
formed.'
"'No
change
finds
you
off
your
guard.
I
was
sure,
in
your
calm
way,
you
would
be
prepared
for
sudden
mutation.
I
always
think

The
savage

I
think
that

of
you
share
your
hearth
with

your
heart.'
