liked
to
feel
himself
of
use.
"Martin,
before
we
separate,
assure
me
seriously,
and
on
your
word
of
honour,
that
Mr.
Moore
is
better."
"How
very
much
you
think
of
that
Moore!"
"No
but
many
of
his
friends
may
ask
me,
and
I
wish
to
be
able
to
give
an
authentic
answer."
"You
may
tell
them
he
is
well
enough,
only
idle.
You
may
tell
them
that
he
takes
mutton
chops
for
dinner,
and
the
best
of
arrowroot
for
supper.
I
intercepted
a
basin
myself
one
night
on
its
way
upstairs,
and
ate
half
of
it."
"And
who
waits
on
him,
Martin?
who
nurses
him?"
"Nurses
him?
The
great
baby!
Why,
a
woman
as
round
and
big
as
our
largest
water
butt
a
rough,
hard
favoured
old
girl.
I
make
no
doubt
she
leads
him
a
rich
life.
Nobody
else
is
let
near
him.
He
is
chiefly
in
the
dark.
It
is
my
belief
she
knocks
him
about
terribly
in
that
chamber.
I
listen
at
the
wall
sometimes
when
I
am
in
bed,
and
I
think
I
hear
her
thumping
him.
You
should
see
her
fist.
She
could
hold
half
a
dozen
hands
like
yours
in
her
one
palm.
