Donne
to
evacuate.
I
shall
have
the
greatest
pleasure
in
receiving
him
in
a
lower
room."
"Ha!
ha!"
cried
Malone,
in
hollow
laughter,
quitting
the
door,
and
leaning
over
the
massive
balustrade.
"Really
that
animal
alarmed
Donne.
He
is
a
little
timid,"
he
proceeded,
stiffening
himself,
and
walking
trimly
to
the
stairhead.
"I

"It

had

again.
Tartar
seemed
to
think
the
visitor's
descent
effected
with
unwarranted
eclat,
and
accordingly
he
growled
once
more.
Malone,
however,
was
no
coward.
The
spring
of
the
dog
had
taken
him
by
