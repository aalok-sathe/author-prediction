in
an
indirect
way,
by
asking
her
if
the
fire
made
her
too
warm,
placing
a
screen
between
her
chair
and
the
hearth,
closing
a
window
whence
she
imagined
a
draught
proceeded,
and
often
and
restlessly
glancing
at
her.
Shirley
resumed:
"Having
destroyed
your
plan,"
she
said,
"which
I
hope
I
have
done,
I
shall
construct
a
new
one
of
my
own.
Every
summer
I
make
an
excursion.
This
season
I
propose
spending
two
months
either
at
the
Scotch
lochs
or
the
English
lakes
that
is,
I
shall
go
there
provided
you
consent
to
accompany
me.
If
you
refuse,
I
shall
not
stir
a
foot."
"You
are
very
good,
Shirley."
"I
would
be
very
good
if
you
would
let

I
have
every
disposition
to
be
good.
It
is
my
misfortune
and
habit,
I
know,
to
think
of
myself
paramount
to
anybody
else;
but
who
is
not
like
me
in
that
respect?
However,
when
Captain
Keeldar
is
made
comfortable,
accommodated
with
all
he
wants,
including
a
sensible,
genial
comrade,
it
gives
him
a
thorough
pleasure
to
devote
his
spare
efforts
to
making
that
comrade
happy.
And
should
we
not
be
happy,
Caroline,
in
the
Highlands?
We
will
go
to
the
