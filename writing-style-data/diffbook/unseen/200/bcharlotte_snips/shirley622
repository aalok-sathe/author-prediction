nor

Besides,
the
man
has
shown
sound
judgment
and
good
sense
first,
in
being
thoroughly
prepared
for
the
event
which
has
taken
place;
and
subsequently,
when
his
well
concerted
plans
had
secured
him
success,
in
knowing
how
to
use
without
abusing
his
victory.

of
the
magistrates
are

and,

to
acknowledge
his
merits,
will
show
a
more
gracious
mien
than
that
with
which
he
has
hitherto
favoured
us."

to
add

this
speech
some
half
jesting,

serious
warnings
to
Miss
Keeldar
on
the
subject
of
her
rumoured
partiality
for
her
talented
tenant,
when
a
ring
at
the
door,
announcing
another
caller,
checked
his
raillery;
and
as
that
other
caller
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
white

elderly
gentleman,
with
a
rather
truculent
countenance
