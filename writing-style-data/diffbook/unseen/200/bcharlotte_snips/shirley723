a
bad
cold."
After
this
visit,
Mrs.
Pryor
took
care
not
to
approach
Caroline's
couch
for
above
an
hour.
She
heard
her
weep,
and
dared
not
look
on
her
tears.
As
evening
closed
in,
she
brought
her
some
tea.
Caroline,
opening
her
eyes
from
a
moment's
slumber,
viewed
her
nurse
with
an
unrecognizing
glance.
"I
smelt
the
honeysuckles
in
the
glen
this
summer
morning,"
she
said,
"as
I
stood
at
the
counting
house
window."
Strange
words
like
these
from
pallid
lips
pierce
a
loving
listener's
heart
more
poignantly
than
steel.
They
sound
romantic,
perhaps,
in
books;
in
real
life
they
are
harrowing.
"My
darling,
do
you
know
me?"
said
Mrs.
Pryor.
"I
went
in
to
call
Robert
to
breakfast.
I
have
been
with
him
in
the
garden.
He
asked
me
to
go.
A
heavy
dew
has
refreshed
the
flowers.
The
peaches
are
ripening."
"My
darling!
my
darling!"
again
and
again
repeated
the
nurse.
"I
thought
it
was
daylight
long
after
sunrise.
It
looks
dark.
Is
the
moon
now
set?"
That
moon,
lately
risen,
was
gazing
full
and
mild
upon
her.
Floating
in
deep
blue
space,
it
watched
her
unclouded.
"Then
it
is
not
morning?
I
am
not
at
the
cottage?
