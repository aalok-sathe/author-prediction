be
preferable
to
service
under
such
a
master.
He
felt
much
cast
down
almost
hopeless.
On
his
entrance
his
wife
served
out,
in
orderly
sort,
such
dinner
as
she
had
to
give
him
and
the
bairns.
It
was
only
porridge,
and
too

He
cleared

with
his
sleeve,
and
the
melting
mood

a
very
stern
one
followed.
He
still
stood
brooding
in
silence,
when
a
gentleman
in
black
came
