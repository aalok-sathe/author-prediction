her;
when
she
was
seated
with
all
honour
and
deference
at
a
table
with
paper,
pen,
ink,
and
what
was
best
of
all
cash
before
her,
and
requested
to
draw
up
a
regular
plan
for
administering
relief
to
the
destitute
poor
of
Briarfield.
She,
who
knew
them
all,
had
studied
their

acquired

the
condition
of
her
fellow
creatures
around
her.
Shirley

300,
and
at

of
the
money
Miss
Ainley's
eyes
filled
with
joyful
tears;
for
she
already
saw
the
hungry
fed,
the
naked
clothed,
the
sick
comforted
thereby.
She
quickly
drew
up
a
simple,

plan
for
its

assured
them
brighter
times
would
now
come
round,
for
she
doubted

example
would
be
