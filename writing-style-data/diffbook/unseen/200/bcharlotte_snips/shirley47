But,
as
is
usual
in
such
cases,
nobody
took
much
notice.
When
a
food
riot
broke
out
in
a
manufacturing
town,
when
a
gig
mill
was
burnt
to
the
ground,
or
a
manufacturer's
house
was
attacked,
the
furniture
thrown
into
the
streets,
and
the
family
forced
to

lives,
some
local
measures
were

detected,
or
more

to
damage
science
by
discouraging
its
improvements;
the
war
could
not

terminated;
efficient

could
not
be
raised.
There
was
no
help

so
the
unemployed
underwent
