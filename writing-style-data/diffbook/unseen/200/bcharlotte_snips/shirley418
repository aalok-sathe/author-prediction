his
conversation
to
Miss
Keeldar.
"I
went
to
the
barracks,"
he
said,
"and
had
an
interview
with
Colonel
Ryde.
He
approved
my
plans,
and
promised
the
aid
I

Indeed,
he
offered
a
more
numerous
force
than
I
require
half
a
dozen
will
suffice.
I

the
Home
Secretary
in
answer
to
mine.
It
appears
they
are
uneasy
at
the
state
of
matters
here
in
the
north;
they
especially
condemn
the
supineness
and
pusillanimity
