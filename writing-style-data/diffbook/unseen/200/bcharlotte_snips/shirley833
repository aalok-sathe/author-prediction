all
of
them
had
stayed
at
De
Walden
Hall
to
dine.
Shirley
should
once
more
have
made
tea
for
you
and
me,
Mr.
Moore,
and
we
would
have
had
a
happy
evening
of
it."
Moore
was
locking
up
his
desk
and
putting
away
his
St.
Pierre.
"That
was
your
plan,
was
it,
my
boy?"
"Don't
you
approve
it,
sir?"
"I
approve
nothing
utopian.
Look
Life
in
its
iron
face;
stare
Reality
out
of
its
brassy
countenance.
Make
the
tea,
Henry;
I
shall
be
back
in
a
minute."
He
left
the
room;
so
did
Shirley,
by
another
door.
Shirley
probably
got
on
pleasantly
with
Sir
Philip
that
evening,
for
the
next
morning
she
came
down
in
one
of
her
best
moods.
"Who
will
take
a
walk
with
me?"
she
asked,
after
breakfast.
"Isabella
and
Gertrude,
will
you?"
So
rare
was
such
an
invitation
from
Miss
Keeldar
to
her
female
cousins
that
they
hesitated
before
they
accepted
it.
Their
mamma,
however,
signifying
acquiescence
in
the
project,
they
fetched
their
bonnets,
and
the
trio
set
out.
It
did
not
suit
these
three
young
persons
to
be
thrown
much
together.
Miss
Keeldar
liked
the
society
of
few
ladies;
indeed,
she
had
a
cordial
pleasure
