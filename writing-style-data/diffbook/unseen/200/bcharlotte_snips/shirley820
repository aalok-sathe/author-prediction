doing
no
good,
never
seen,
never
needed
a
star
in
an
else
starless
firmament,
which
nor
shepherd,
nor
wanderer,
nor
sage,
nor
priest
tracked
as
a
guide
or
read
as
a
prophecy?
Could
this
be,
she
demanded,
when
the
flame
of
her
intelligence
burned
so
vivid;
when
her
life
beat
so
true,
and
real,
and
potent;
when
something
within
her
stirred
disquieted,
and
restlessly
asserted
a
God
given
strength,
for
which
it
insisted
she
should
find
exercise?
She
gazed
abroad
on
Heaven
and
Evening.
Heaven
and
Evening
gazed
back
on
her.
She
bent
down,
searching
bank,
hill,
river,
spread
dim
below.
All
she
questioned
responded
by
oracles.
She
heard
she
was
impressed;
but
she
could
not
understand.
Above
her
head
she
raised
her
hands
joined
together.
"Guidance
help
comfort
come!"
was
her
cry.
There
was
no
voice,
nor
any
that
answered.
She
waited,
kneeling,
steadfastly
looking
up.
Yonder
sky
was
sealed;
the
solemn
stars
shone
alien
and
remote.
At
last
one
overstretched
chord
of
her
agony
slacked;
she
thought
Something
above
relented;
she
felt
as
if
Something
far
round
drew
nigher;
she
heard
as
if
Silence
spoke.
There
was
no
language,
no
word,
only
a
tone.
Again
a
fine,
full,
