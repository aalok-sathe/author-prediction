history
not
from
herself,
but
from
others.
With
every
detail
of
Mr.
James
Helstone's
career
and
character
I
was
acquainted.
An
afternoon's
sitting
and
conversation
with
Miss
Mann
had
rendered
me
familiar
therewith;
also
he
is
one
of
Mrs.
Yorke's
warning
examples
one
of
the
blood
red
lights
she
hangs
out
to
scare
young
ladies
from
matrimony.
I
believe
I
should
have
been
sceptical
about
the
truth
of
the
portrait
traced
by
such
fingers

these
ladies
take
a

questioned
Mr.
Yorke
on

and
he
said,

handsome,
dissolute,
soft,
treacherous,
courteous,
cruel

Don't

Cary;
we'll
say
no
more
about
it."
"I
am
not
crying,
Shirley;
or
if
I
am,
it
is
nothing.
Go
on;
you
are
no
friend
if
you
withhold
from
me
the
truth.
I
hate
that
false
plan
of
disguising,
mutilating
the
truth."
"Fortunately
I
have
said
pretty
nearly
all
that
I
have
to
say,
except
that
your
uncle
himself
confirmed
Mr.
Yorke's
words;
for
he
