whose
person
the
people
have
been
accustomed
for
fifty
years,
who
know
all
their
ways,
prejudices,
and
preferences
easy,
indeed,
for
you
to
act
so
as
to
avoid
offending
them.
But
Mr.
Moore
came
a
stranger
into
the
district;
he
came
here
poor
and
friendless,
with
nothing
but
his
own
energies
to
back
him,
nothing
but
his
honour,
his
talent,
and
his
industry
to
make
his
way
for
him.
A
monstrous
crime
indeed
that,
under
such
circumstances,
he
could
not
popularize
his
naturally
grave,
quiet
manners
all
at
once;
could
not
be
jocular,
and
free,
and
cordial
with
a
strange
peasantry,
as
you
are
with
your
fellow
townsmen!
An
unpardonable
transgression
that
when
he
introduced
improvements
he
did
not
go
about
the
business
in
quite
the
most
politic
way,
did
not
graduate
his
changes
as
delicately
as
a
rich
capitalist
might
have
done!
For
errors
of
this
sort
is
he
to
be
the
victim
of
mob
outrage?
Is
he
to
be
denied
even
the
privilege
of
defending
himself?
Are
those
who
have
the
hearts
of
men
in
their
breasts
(and
Mr.
Helstone,
say
what
you
will
of
him,
has
such
a
heart)
to
be
reviled
like
malefactors
because
they
stand
