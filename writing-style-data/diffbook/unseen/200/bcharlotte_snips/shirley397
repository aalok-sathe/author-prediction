counteract
or
at
least
be
prepared
for
theirs
that
is
all.
Having
now
given
you
as
clear
an
explanation
as
I
can,
am
I
to
understand
that
for
what
I
propose
doing
I
have
your
approbation?"
"I
shall
stand
by
you
so
long
as
you
remain
on
the
defensive.
Yes."
"Good!
Without
any
aid
even
opposed
or
disapproved
by
you
I
believe
I
should
have
acted
precisely

would
relish
the
execution
of
a
government

for
army

"I

"So

difference
in
your
motives
many
shades,
perhaps.
Shall
I
speak

Mr.
Helstone?
I
will,
if

like."
"Act
as
you
please.
Your
judgment,
Miss
Keeldar,
will
guide
you
accurately.
I
could
rely
on
it
myself
in
a
more
difficult
crisis.
But
I
should
inform
you
Mr.
Helstone
is
somewhat
prejudiced
against
me
at
present."
"I
am
aware
I
have
heard
all
about
