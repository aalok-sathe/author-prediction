which
he
did
a
fortnight
since;
no
wonder
Barraclough,
scamp
and
hypocrite
as
he
is,
should
attract
all
the
weaver
girls
in
their
flowers
and
ribbons,
to
witness
how
much
harder
are
his
knuckles
than
the
wooden
brim
of
his
tub;
as
little
wonder
that
you,
when
you
are
left
to
yourselves,

and

And

the
mighty

"Bah!
weapons
I

pistols
you
gave
me
yourself.
I
never
part
with
them.
I
lay
them
