both
these
personages;
but
by
dint
of
strict
civility
and
well
maintained
distance
they
got
on
very
smoothly.
Towards
the
servants
Mrs.
Pryor's
bearing
was
not
uncourteous,
but
shy,
freezing,
ungenial.
Perhaps
it
was
diffidence
rather
than
pride
which
made
her
appear
so
haughty;
but,
as
was
to
be
expected,
Fanny
and
Eliza
failed
to
make
the
distinction,
and
she
was
unpopular
with
them
accordingly.
She
felt
the
effect
produced;
it
rendered
her
at
times
dissatisfied
with
herself
for
faults
she
could
not
help,
and
with
all
else
dejected,
chill,
and
taciturn.
This
mood
changed
to
Caroline's
influence,
and
to
that
influence
alone.
The
dependent
fondness
of
her
nursling,
the
natural
affection
of
her
child,
came
over
her
suavely.
Her
frost
fell
away,
her
rigidity
unbent;
she
grew
smiling
and
pliant.
Not
that
Caroline
made
any
wordy
profession
of
love
that
would
ill
have
suited
Mrs.
Pryor;
she
would
have
read
therein
the
proof
of
insincerity
but
she
hung
on
her
with
easy
dependence;
she
confided
in
her
with
fearless
reliance.
These
things
contented
the
mother's
heart.
She
liked
to
hear
her
daughter
say,
"Mamma,
do
this;"
"Please,
mamma,
fetch
me
that;"
"Mamma,
read
to
me;"
"Sing
a
little,
mamma."
