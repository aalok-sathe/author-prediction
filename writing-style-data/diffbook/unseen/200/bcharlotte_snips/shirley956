before
nor
any
female,
save,
now
and
then,
a
village
girl
come
to
gather
nuts.
To
night
the
apparition
does
not
displease
him.
He
observes,
as
she
approaches,
that
she
is
neither
old
nor
plain,
but,
on
the
contrary,
very
youthful;
and,
but
that
he
now
recognizes
her
for
one
whom
he
has
often
wilfully
pronounced
ugly,
he
would
deem
that
he
discovered
traits
of
beauty
behind
the
thin
gauze
of
that
veil.
She
passes
him
and
says
nothing.
He
knew
she
would.
All
women
are
proud
monkeys,
and
he

The

glance
on
his

of
Mr.
Yorke's
sons?"
No
human
evidence
would
ever
have
been
able
to
persuade
Martin
Yorke
that
he
blushed
when
thus
addressed;
yet
blush
he
did,
to
the
ears.
"I
am,"
he
said
bluntly,
and
encouraged
himself
to
wonder,
superciliously,
what
would
come
next.
"You
are
Martin,
I
think?"
was
the
observation
that
followed.
It
could
not
have
been
more
felicitous.
It
was
