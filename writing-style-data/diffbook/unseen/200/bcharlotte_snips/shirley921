the
delicious
worldly
fuss
should
pompously
begin.
At
last
there
came
a
letter.
He
himself
handed
it
to
Miss
Keeldar
out
of
the
bag.
He
knew
the
handwriting;
he
knew
the
crest
on
the
seal.
He
did
not
see
it
opened
and
read,
for
Shirley
took
it
to
her
own
room;
nor
did

Again

and
to
ask
an
interpretation;
but
his
dignity
forbade
the
familiarity.
Daniel
himself,
perhaps,
had
his
own
private
difficulties
connected
with
that
baffling
bit
of
translation;
he
looked
like
a
student
for
whom
grammars
are
blank
and
dictionaries
dumb.
Mr.
Sympson
had
been
out,
