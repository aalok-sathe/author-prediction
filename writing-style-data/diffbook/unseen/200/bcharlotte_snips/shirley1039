not
to
be
my
baby.
I
am
not
to
set
him
his
daily
lesson
and
see
that
he
learns
it,
and
give
him
a
sugar
plum
if
he
is
good,
and
a
patient,
pensive,
pathetic
lecture
if
he
is
bad.
But
it
is
like
a
tutor
to
talk
of
the
"satisfaction
of
teaching."
I
suppose
you
think
it
the
finest
employment
in
the
world.
I
don't.
I
reject
it.
Improving
a
husband!
No.
I
shall
insist
upon
my
husband
improving
me,
or
else
we
part.'
"'God
knows
it
is
needed!'
"'What
do
you
mean
by
that,
Mr.
Moore?'
"'What
I
say.
Improvement
is
imperatively
needed.'
"'If
you
were
a
woman
you
would
school
monsieur,
votre
mari,
charmingly.
It
would
just
suit
you;
schooling
is
your
vocation.'
"'May
I
ask
whether,
in
your
present
just
and
gentle
mood,
you
mean
to
taunt
me
with
being
a
tutor?'
"'Yes,
bitterly;
and
with
anything
else
you
please
any
defect
of
which
you
are
painfully
conscious.'
"'With
being
poor,
for
instance?'
"'Of
course;
that
will
sting
you.
You
are
sore
about
your
poverty;
you
brood
over
that.'
"'With
having
nothing
but
a
very
plain
person
to
offer
the
woman
who
may
master
my
heart?'
