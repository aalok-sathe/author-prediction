slow
to
make
fresh
acquaintance.
She
was
always
held
back
by
the
idea
that
people
could
not
want
her,
that
she
could
not
amuse
them;
and
a
brilliant,
happy,
youthful
creature
like
the
heiress
of
Fieldhead
seemed
to
her
too
completely
independent
of
society
so
uninteresting
as
hers
ever
to
find
it
really
welcome.
Shirley
might
be
brilliant,
and
probably
happy
likewise,
but
no
one
is
independent
of
genial
society;
and
though
in
about
a
month
she
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
most
of
the
families
round,
and
was
on
quite
free
and
easy
terms
with
all
the
Misses
Sykes,
and
all
the
Misses
Pearson,
and
the
two
superlative
Misses
Wynne
of
Walden
Hall,
yet,
it
appeared,
she
found
none
amongst
them
very
genial:
she
fraternized
with
none
of
them,
to
use
her
own
words.
If
she
had
had
the
bliss
to
be
really
Shirley
Keeldar,
Esq.,
lord
of
the
manor
of
Briarfield,
there
was
not
a
single
fair
one
in
this
and
the
two
neighbouring
parishes
whom
she
should
have
felt
disposed
to
request
to
become
Mrs.
Keeldar,
lady
of
the
manor.
This
declaration
she
made
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
received
it
very
quietly,
as
she
did
most
of
