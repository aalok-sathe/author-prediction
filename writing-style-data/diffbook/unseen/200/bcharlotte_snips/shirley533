she
was
shy
even
with
them
out
of
school.
They
were
not
more
in
awe
of
her
than
she
of
them.
She
drew
near
them
now,
rather
to
find
protection
in
their
company
than
to
patronize
them
with
her
presence.
By
some
instinct
they
knew
her
weakness,
and
with

her
slight
smiles
and
rather

efforts
to

and
good
breeding

last
quality
being
the
result
of
the
first
which
soon
set
her
at
her
ease.
