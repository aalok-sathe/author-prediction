of
the
working
classes
no
longer;
he
had
considered
of
it,
and
made
up
his
mind
to
go
all
lengths;
if
money
and
spirit
could
put
down
these
rioters,
they
should
be
put
down;
Mr.
Moore
might
do
as
he
liked,
but
he
Christie
Sykes
would
spend
his
last
penny
in
law
before
he
would
be
beaten;
he'd
settle
them,
or
he'd
see.
"Take
another
glass,"
urged
Moore.
Mr.
Sykes
didn't
mind
if
he
did.
This
was
a
cold
morning
(Sugden
had
found
it
a
warm
one);
it
was
necessary
to
be
careful
at
this
season
of
the
year
it
was
proper
to
take
something
to
keep
the
damp
out;
he
had
a
little
cough
already
(here
he
coughed
in
attestation
of
the
fact);
something
of
this
sort
(lifting
the
black
bottle)
was
excellent,
taken
medicinally
(he
poured
the
physic
into
his
tumbler);
he
didn't
make
a
practice
of
drinking
spirits
in
a
morning,
but
occasionally
it
really
was
prudent
to
take
precautions.
"Quite
prudent,
and
take
them
by
all
means,"
urged
the
host.
Mr.
Sykes
now
addressed
Mr.
Helstone,
who
stood
on
the
hearth,
his
shovel
hat
on
his
head,
watching
him
significantly
with
his
little,
keen
eyes.
"You,
