into
a
parlour.
Of
course,
as
was
to
be
expected
in
such
a
Gothic
old
barrack,
this
parlour
was
lined
with
oak:
fine,
dark,
glossy
panels
compassed
the
walls
gloomily
and
grandly.
Very
handsome,
reader,
these
shining
brown
panels
are,
very
mellow
in
colouring
and
tasteful
in
effect,
but
if
you
know
what
a
"spring
clean"
is
very
execrable
and
inhuman.
Whoever,
having
the
bowels
of
humanity,
has
seen
servants
scrubbing
at
these
polished
wooden
walls
with
beeswaxed
cloths
on
a
warm
May
day
must
allow
that
they
are
"intolerable
and
not
to
be
endured;"
and
I
cannot
but
secretly
applaud
the
benevolent
barbarian
who
had
painted
another
and
larger
apartment
of
Fieldhead
the
drawing
room,
to
wit,
formerly
also
an
oak
room
of
a
delicate
pinky
white,
thereby
earning
for
himself
the
character
of
a
Hun,
but
mightily
enhancing
the
cheerfulness
of
that
portion
of
his
abode,
and
saving
future
housemaids
a
world
of
toil.
The
brown
panelled
parlour
was
furnished
all
in
old
style,
and
with
real
old
furniture.
On
each
side
of
the
high
mantelpiece
stood
two
antique
chairs
of
oak,
solid
as
silvan
thrones,
and
in
one
of
these
sat
a
lady.
But
if
this
