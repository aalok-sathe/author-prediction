Louis,
then;
approach
him
let
him
approach.'
"'I
am
cordial,'
said
she,
hovering
aloof
like
a
white
shadow.
"'Your
voice
is
very
sweet
and
very
low,'
I
answered,
quietly
advancing.
'You
seem
subdued,
but
still
startled.'
"'No
quite
calm,
and
afraid
of
nothing,'
she
assured
me.
"'Of
nothing
but
your
votary.'
"I
bent
a
knee
to
the
flags
at
her
feet.
"'You
see
I
am
in
a
new
world,
Mr.
Moore.
I
don't
know
myself;
I
don't
know
you.
But
rise.
When
you
do
so
I
feel
troubled
and
disturbed.'
"I
obeyed.
It
would
not
have
suited
me
to
retain
that
attitude
long.
I
courted
serenity
and
confidence
for
her,
and
not
vainly.
She
trusted
and
clung
to
me
again.
"'Now,
Shirley,'
I
said,
'you
can
conceive
I
am
far
from
happy
in
my
present
uncertain,
unsettled
state.'
"'Oh
yes,
you
are
happy!'
she
cried
hastily.
'You
don't
know
how
happy
you
are.
Any
change
will
be
for
the
worse.'
"'Happy
or
not,
I
cannot
bear
to
go
on
so
much
longer.
You
are
too
generous
to
require
it.'
"'Be
reasonable,
Louis;
be
patient!
I
like
you
because
you
are
patient.'
"'Like
me
no
longer,
then;
love
me
instead.
