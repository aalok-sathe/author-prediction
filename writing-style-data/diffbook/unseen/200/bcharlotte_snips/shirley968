knew
his
ground,
and
pronounced
all
well.
With
the
true
perspicacity
des
ames
elites,
he
at
once
saw
how
this
at
first
sight
untoward
event
might
be
turned
to
excellent
account.
He
saw
how
it
might
be
so
handled
as
to
secure
the
accomplishment
of
his
second
task
namely,
the
disposal

were
the
signals.
They
rushed
at
it.
Martin,
who
usually
made
little
noise
on
these
occasions,
made
a
great
deal
now.
In
flew
the
servants,
Mrs.
Yorke,
Miss
Moore.
No
female
hand
could
separate
them.
Mr.
Yorke
was
summoned.
"Sons,"
said
he,
"one
of
you
must
leave
my
roof
if
this
occurs
again.
I
will
have
no
Cain
and
Abel
strife
here."
Martin
now
allowed
himself
