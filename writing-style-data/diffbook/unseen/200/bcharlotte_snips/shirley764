his
lady
was
a
very
good
woman
patient,
kind,

She
had
been
brought
up
on
a
narrow
system
of
views,
starved
on
a
few
prejudices
a
mere
handful
of
bitter
herbs;
a
few
preferences,
soaked
till
their
natural
flavour
was
extracted,
and
with
no
seasoning
added

code
of

themselves
never

from
its
curious
