went,
he
was
conquered.
"Now,
follow
me!"
exclaimed
Helstone;
"not
at
a
run,
but
at
a
firm,
smart
pace.
Be
steady,
every
child
and
woman
of
you.
Keep
together.
Hold
on
by
each
other's
skirts,
if
necessary."
And
he
strode
on
with
such
a
determined
and
deliberate
gait,
and
was,
besides,
so
well
seconded
by
his
scholars
and
teachers,
who
did
exactly
as
he
told
them,
neither

but
marching
with
cool,
solid
impetus
the
curates,
too,
being
compelled
to
do

breach
of
orders,
the

or
irregular
demonstration
that
the
body
of
Dissenters
were
first
amazed,
then
alarmed,
then
borne
down
and
pressed
back,
and
at
last
forced
to
turn
tail
and
leave
the
outlet
from
Royd
Lane
free.
Boultby
suffered
in
the
onslaught,
but
Helstone
and
Malone,
between
them,
held
him
up,
and
brought
him
through
the
business,
whole
in

though
sorely
tried
