my
dear,
have
the
goodness
to
remind
Miss
Helstone
to
wrap
up
well,
as
there
is
a
fresh
wind,
and
she
appears
to
me
to
require
care."
"You
shall
be
minutely
obeyed,
Mrs.
Pryor.
Meantime,
will
you
not
accompany
us
yourself?"
"No,
my
love;
I
should
be
a
restraint
upon
you.
I
am
stout,
and
cannot
walk
so
quickly
as
you
would
wish
to
do."
Shirley
easily
persuaded
Caroline
to
go
with
her,
and
when
they
were
fairly
out
on
the
quiet
road,
traversing
the
extensive
and
solitary
sweep
of
Nunnely
Common,
she
as
easily
drew
her
into
conversation.
The
first
feelings
of
diffidence
overcome,
Caroline
soon
felt
glad
to
talk
with
Miss
Keeldar.
The
very
first
interchange
of
slight
observations
sufficed
to
give
each
an
idea
of
what
the
other
was.
Shirley
said
she
liked
the
green
sweep
of
the
common
turf,
and,
better
still,
the
heath
on
its
ridges,
for
the
heath
reminded
her
of
moors.
She
had
seen
moors
when
she
was
travelling
on
the
borders
near
Scotland.
She
remembered
particularly
a
district
traversed
one
long
afternoon,
on
a
sultry
but
sunless
day
in
summer.
They
journeyed
from
noon
till
sunset,
over
what
seemed
a
boundless
waste
