Moses!
He
was
the
right
thing
there,
fit
to
head

measures

the
regeneration
of
nations.
It
puzzles
me
to
this
day
how
the
conqueror
of
Lodi
should
have
condescended
to
become
an
emperor,
a
vulgar,
a
stupid
humbug;
and
still
more
how
a
people
who
had
once
called
themselves
republicans
should
have
sunk
again
to
the
grade
of
mere
slaves.
I
despise
France!
If
England
had
gone
as
far
on
the
march
of
civilization
as
France
did,
she
would
hardly
have
retreated
so
shamelessly."
"You
don't
mean
to
say
that
besotted
imperial
France
is
any
worse
than

demanded
Helstone
fiercely.
"I
mean
to
say
nothing,
but
I
can

Mr.
Helstone,
both
about
France
and
England;
and
about
revolutions,
and
regicides,
and
restorations
in
general;
and
about
the
divine
right
of
kings,
which
you
often
stickle
for
in
your
sermons,
and
the
duty
of
non
resistance,
and
the
sanity
of
war,
and
"
Mr.
Moore's
sentence
was
here
cut
short
by
the
rapid
rolling
up
of
a
gig,
and
its
sudden
stoppage
in
the
middle
of
the
road.
Both
he
and
