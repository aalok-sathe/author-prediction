Moore,
what
is
your
business
with
us?
I
thought
you
would
want
us
to
night
me
and
the
hetman
here
(patting
his
pony's
neck),
and
Tom
and
his
charger.
When
I
heard
your
mill
bell
I
could
sit
still
no
longer,
so
I
left
Boultby
to
finish
his
supper
alone.
But
where
is
the
enemy?
I
do
not
see
a
mask
or
a
smutted
face
present;
and
there
is
not
a
pane
of
glass
broken
in
your
windows.
Have
you
had
an
attack,
or
do
you
expect
one?"
"Oh,
not
at
all!
I
have
neither
had
one
nor
expect
one,"
answered
Moore
coolly.
"I
only
ordered
the
bell
to
be
rung
because
I
want
two
or
three
neighbours
to
stay
here
in
the
Hollow
while
I
and
a
couple
or
so
more
go
over
to
Stilbro'
Moor."
"To
Stilbro'
Moor!
What
to
do?
To
meet
the
wagons?"
"The
wagons
are
come
home
an
hour
ago."
"Then
all's
right.
What
more
would
you
have?"
"They
came
home
empty;
and
Joe
Scott
and
company
are
left
on
the
moor,
and
so
are
the
frames.
Read
that
scrawl."
Mr.
Helstone
received
and
perused
the
document
of
which
the
contents
have
before
been
given.
