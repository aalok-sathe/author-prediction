my
son?"
asked
the
father.
"Somewhere
where
I
shall
be
safe
from
insult,
if
in
this
house
I
can
find
any
such
place."
Matthew
laughed
very
insolently.
Martin
threw
a
strange
look
at
him,
and
trembled
through
all
his
slight
lad's
frame;
but
he
restrained
himself.
"I
suppose
there
is
no
objection
to
my
withdrawing?"
he
inquired.
"No.
Go,
my
lad;
but
remember
not
to
bear
malice."
Martin
went,
and
Matthew
sent
another
insolent
laugh
after
him.
Rose,
lifting
her
fair
head
from
Moore's
shoulder,
against
which,
for
a
moment,
it
had
been
resting,
said,
as
she
directed
a
steady
gaze
to
Matthew,
"Martin
is
grieved,
and
you
are
glad;
but
I
would
rather
be
Martin
than
you.
I
dislike
your
nature."
Here
Mr.
Moore,
by
way
of
averting,
or
at
least
escaping,
a
scene
which
a
sob
from
Mrs.
Yorke
warned
him
was
likely
to
come
on
rose,
and
putting
Jessy
off
his
knee,
he
kissed
her
and
Rose,
reminding
them,
at
the
same
time,
to
be
sure
and
come
to
the
Hollow
in
good
time
to
morrow
afternoon;
then,
having
taken
leave
of
his
hostess,
he
said
to
Mr.
Yorke,
"May
I
speak
a
word
with
you?"
and
