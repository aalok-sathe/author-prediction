am
not
cherishing
love
dreams;
I
am
only
thinking
because
I
cannot
sleep.
Of
course,
I
know
he
will
marry
Shirley."
With
returning
silence,
with
the
lull
of
the
chime,
and
the
retreat
of
her
small
untamed
and
unknown
protege,
she
still
resumed
the
dream,
nestling
to
the
vision's
side
listening

crept
to
her
couch,
chill
and
dejected.
"Of

were
her
first
words
when
she
rose
in
the
morning.
"And
he
ought

she
added
firmly.
"But
I
shall
be
forgotten
