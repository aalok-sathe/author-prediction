of
rain
clouds,
gathering
mists,
fitful
sunbeams,
and
what
not."
"Here
is
the
portfolio,"
said
Henry,
bringing
it
in
one
hand
and
leaning
on
his
crutch
with
the
other.
Louis
took
it,
but
he
still
sat
as
if
he
wanted
another
to
speak.
It
seemed
as
if
he
would
not
open
it
unless
the
proud
Shirley
deigned
to
show
herself
interested
in
the
exhibition.
"He
makes
us
wait
to
whet
our
curiosity,"
she
said.
"You
understand
opening
it,"
observed
Louis,
giving
her
the
key.
"You
spoiled
the
lock
for
me
once;
try
now."
He
held
it.
She
opened
it,
and,
monopolizing
the
contents,
had
the
first
view
of
every
sketch
herself.
She
enjoyed
the
treat
if
treat
it
were
in
silence,
without
a
single
comment.
Moore
stood
behind
her
chair
and
looked
over
her
shoulder,
and
when
she
had
done
and
the
others
were
still
gazing,
he
left
his
post
and
paced
through
the
room.
A
carriage
was
heard
in
the
lane
the
gate
bell
rang.
Shirley
started.
"There
are
callers,"
she
said,
"and
I
shall
be
summoned
to
the
room.
A
pretty
figure
as
they
say
I
am
to
receive
company.
I
and
Henry
have
been
in
the
garden
