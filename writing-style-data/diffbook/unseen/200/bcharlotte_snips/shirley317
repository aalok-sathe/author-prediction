only
habit
to
make
it
practicable
and
agreeable
to
any
one.
It
was
despicable,
she
felt,
to
pine
sentimentally,
to
cherish
secret
griefs,
vain
memories,
to
be
inert,
to
waste
youth
in
aching
languor,
to
grow
old
doing
nothing.
"I
will
bestir
myself,"
was
her
resolution,
"and
try
to
be
wise
if
I
cannot
be
good."
She
proceeded
to
make
inquiry
of
Miss
Ainley
if
she
could
help
her
in
anything.
Miss
Ainley,
glad
of
an
assistant,
told
her
that
she
could,
and
indicated
some
poor
families
in
Briarfield
that
it
was
desirable
she
should
visit,
giving
her
likewise,
at
her
further
request,
some
work
to
do
for
certain
poor
women
who
had
many
children,
and
who
were
unskilled
in
using
the
needle
for
themselves.
Caroline
went
home,
laid
her
plans,
and
took
a
resolve
not
to
swerve
from
them.
She
allotted
a
certain
portion
of
her
time
for
her
various
studies,
and
a
certain
portion
for
doing
anything
Miss
Ainley
might
direct
her
to
do.
The
remainder
was
to
be
spent
in
exercise;
not
a
moment
was
to
be
left
for
the
indulgence
of
such
fevered
thoughts
as
had
poisoned
last
Sunday
evening.
To
do
her
justice,
she
executed
