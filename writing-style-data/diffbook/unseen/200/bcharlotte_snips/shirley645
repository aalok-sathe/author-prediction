her
manner
as
she
spoke,
"the
young,
especially
those
to
whom
nature
has
been
favourable,
often
frequently
anticipate
look
forward
to
to
marriage
as
the
end,
the
goal
of
their
hopes."
And
she
stopped.
Caroline
came
to
her
relief
with
promptitude,
showing
a
great
deal
more
self
possession
and
courage
than
herself
on
the
formidable
topic
now
broached.
"They
do,
and
naturally,"
she
replied,
with
a
calm
emphasis
that
startled
Mrs.
Pryor.
"They
look
forward
to
marriage
with
some
one
they
love
as
the
brightest,
the
only
bright
destiny
that
can
await
them.
Are
they
wrong?"
"Oh,
my
dear!"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Pryor,
clasping
her
hands;
and
again
she
paused.
Caroline
turned
a
searching,
an
eager
eye
on
the
face
of
her
friend:
that
face
was
much
agitated.
"My
dear,"
she
murmured,
"life
is
an
illusion."
"But
not
love!
Love
is
real
the
most
real,
the
most
lasting,
the
sweetest
and
yet
the
bitterest
thing
we
know."
"My
dear,
it
is
very
bitter.
It
is
said
to
be
strong
strong
as
death!
Most
of
the
cheats
of
existence
are
strong.
As
to
their
sweetness,
nothing
is
so
transitory;
its
date
is
a
moment,
the
twinkling
of
an
eye.
The
sting
remains
