as
far
as
opposition
to
the
war
party
was
concerned,
that
being
the
question
which
affected
his
own
interest;
and
only
on
that
question
did
he
profess
any
British
politics
at
all.
He
liked
to
infuriate
Helstone
by
declaring
his
belief
in
the
invincibility
of
Bonaparte,
by
taunting
England
and
Europe
with
the
impotence
of
their
efforts
to
withstand
him,
and
by
coolly
advancing

opinion
that
it
was

It

indulging
the
wish
he
felt
to
cane
the
speaker.
Another
thing,
too,
somewhat
allayed
his
disgust
namely,
a
fellow
feeling
for
the
dogged
tone
with
which
these
opinions
were
asserted,
and
a
respect
for
the
consistency
of
Moore's
crabbed
contumacy.
As
the
party
turned
into
the
Stilbro'
road,
they
met
what
little
wind
there
was;
the
rain
dashed
in
their
faces.
