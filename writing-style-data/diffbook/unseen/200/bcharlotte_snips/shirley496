That
sun
rose
broad
on
Whitsuntide.
The
gathering
of
the
schools
was
signalized
by
splendid
weather.
Whit
Tuesday
was
the
great
day,
in
preparation
for
which
the
two
large
schoolrooms
of
Briarfield,
built
by
the
present
rector,
chiefly
at
his
own
expense,
were
cleaned
out,
whitewashed,
repainted,
and
decorated
with
flowers
and
evergreens
some
from
the
rectory
garden,
two
cartloads
from
Fieldhead,
and
a
wheel
barrowful
from
the

stingy
domain
of
De

Mr.

the
piercing

of
these
birds,
and
knew
that
amidst
confusion
of
tongues
they
always
carolled
loudest.
These
tables,
be
it
understood,
were
not
spread
for
the
twelve
hundred
scholars
to
be
assembled
from
the
three
parishes,
but
only
for
the
patrons
and
teachers
of
the
schools.
The
children's
feast
was
to
be
spread
in
the
open
air.
At

the
troops
were
to
come
in;
