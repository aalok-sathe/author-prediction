room,
that
woman
with
the
dove
in
her
hand
at
least
she
has
eyes
like
it,
and
a
nose
too,
a
straight
nose,
that
makes
all
her
face
look,
somehow,
what
I
call
clear."
"And
you
don't
know
her!"
exclaimed
Jessy,
in
a
tone
of
exceeding
surprise.
"That's
so
like
Rose.
Mr.
Moore,
I
often
wonder
in
what
sort
of
a
world
my
sister
lives.
I

it.
Miss
Helstone
was
quite
angry
with
Anne
Pearson.
She
said,
'Robert
Moore
is
neither
affected
nor
sentimental;
you
mistake
his
character
utterly,
or
rather
not
one
of
you
here
knows
anything
about
it.'
Now,
shall
I
tell
you
what
she
is
like?
I
can
tell
what
people
are
like,
and
how
they
are
dressed,

Rose
can."
"Let
us
hear."
"She
is
nice;
