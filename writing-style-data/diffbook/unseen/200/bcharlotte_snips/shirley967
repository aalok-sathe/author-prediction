he
surveyed
with
favour
some
currant
tea
cakes,
and
condescended
to
make
choice
of
one.
Thanks
to
his
clasp
knife,
he
was
able
to
appropriate
a
wing
of
fowl
and
a
slice
of
ham;
a
cantlet
of
cold
custard
pudding
he
thought
would
harmonize
with
these
articles;
and
having
made
this
final
addition
to
his
booty,
he
at
length
sallied

into
the
hall.
He

He
had

amongst
which
the
phrase
"shamming
Abraham"
had
been
very
distinctly
audible,
and
the
succession
to
the
armchair
and
newspaper
had
appeared
to
affect
him
with
mental
spasms.
The
spectacle
now
