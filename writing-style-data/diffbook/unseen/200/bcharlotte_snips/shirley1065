unique.
He
begged
of
high
and
low
of
the
shoeless
cottage
brat
and
the
coroneted
duke.
He
sent
out
begging
letters
far
and
wide
to
old
Queen
Charlotte,
to
the
princesses
her
daughters,
to
her
sons
the
royal
dukes,
to
the
Prince
Regent,
to
Lord
Castlereagh,
to
every
member
of
the
ministry
then
in
office;
and,
what
is
more
remarkable,
he
screwed
something
out
of
every
one
of
these
personages.
It
is
on
record
that
he
got
five
pounds
from
the
close
fisted
old
lady
Queen
Charlotte,
and
two
guineas
from
the
royal
profligate
her
eldest
son.
When
Mr.
Donne
set
out
on
begging
expeditions,
he
armed
himself
in
a
complete
suit
of
brazen
mail.
That
you
had
given
a
hundred
pounds
yesterday
was
with
him
no
reason
why
you
should
not
give
two
hundred
to
day.
He
would
tell
you
so
to
your
face,
and,
ten
to
one,
get
the
money
out
of
you.
People
gave
to
get
rid
of
him.
After
all,
he
did
some
good
with
the
cash.
He
was
useful
in
his
day
and
generation.
Perhaps
I
ought
to
remark
that
on
the
premature
and
sudden
vanishing
of
Mr.
Malone
from
the
stage
of
Briarfield
parish
