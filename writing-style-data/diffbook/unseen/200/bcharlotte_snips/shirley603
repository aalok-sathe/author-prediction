hope
they
will
not
be
too
severe
not
pursue
the
discomfited
too
relentlessly."
"Robert
will
not
be
cruel.
We
saw
that
last
night,"
said
Caroline.
"But
he
will
be
hard,"
retorted
Shirley;
"and
so
will
your
uncle."
As
they
hurried
along
the
meadow
and
plantation
path
to
Fieldhead,
they
saw
the
distant
highway
already
alive
with
an
unwonted
flow
of
equestrians
and
pedestrians,
tending
in
the
direction
of
the
usually
solitary
Hollow.
On
reaching
the
hall,
they
found
the
backyard
gates
open,
and
the
court
and
kitchen
seemed
crowded
with
excited
milk
fetchers
men,
women,
and
children
whom
Mrs.
Gill,
the
housekeeper,
appeared
vainly
persuading
to
take
their
milk
cans
and
depart.
(It
is,
or
was,
by
the
bye,
the
custom
in
the
north
of
England
for
the
cottagers
on
a
country
squire's
estate
to
receive
their
supplies
of
milk
and
butter
from
the
dairy
of
the
manor
house,
on
whose
pastures
a
herd
of
milch
kine
was
usually
fed
for
the
convenience
of
the
neighbourhood.
Miss
Keeldar
owned
such
a
herd
all
deep
dewlapped,
Craven
cows,
reared
on
the
sweet
herbage
and
clear
waters
of
bonny
Airedale;
and
very
proud
she
was
of
their
sleek
aspect
and
high
condition.)
