but
less
awful;
for
it
was
a
sick,
living
girl,
not
a
mere
white
mould
or
rigid
piece
of
statuary.
Now,
too,
she
was
not
always
petitioning
to
drink.
The
words,
"I
am
so
thirsty,"
ceased
to
be
her
plaint.
Sometimes,
when
she
had
swallowed
a
morsel,
she
would
say
it
had
revived
her.
All
descriptions
of
food
were
no
longer
equally
distasteful;
she
could
be
induced,
sometimes,
to
indicate
a
preference.
With
what
trembling
pleasure
and
anxious
care
did
not
her
nurse
prepare
what
was
selected!
How
she
watched
her
as
she
partook
of
it!
Nourishment
brought
strength.
She
could
sit
up.
Then
she
longed
to
breathe
the
fresh
air,
to
revisit
her
flowers,
to
see
how
the
fruit
had
ripened.
Her
uncle,
always
liberal,
had
bought
a
garden
chair
for
her
express
use.
He
carried
her
down
in
his
own
arms,
and
placed
her
in
it
himself,
and
William
Farren
was
there
to
wheel
her
round
the
walks,
to
show
her
what
he
had
done
amongst
her
plants,
to
take
her
directions
for
further
work.
William
and
she
found
plenty
to
talk
about.
They
had
a
dozen
topics
in
common
interesting
to
them,
unimportant
to
the
rest
