clear
and
legible
hand,
the
story
that
has
been
narrated,
the
song
that
has
been
sung
to
her,
and
thus
possess
what
she
was
enabled
to
create.
But
indolent
she
is,
reckless
she
is,
and
most
ignorant;
for
she
does
not
know
her
dreams
are
rare,
her
feelings
peculiar.
She
does
not
know,
has
never
known,
and
will
die
without
knowing,
the
full
value
of
that
spring
whose
bright
fresh
bubbling
in
her
heart
keeps
it
green.
Shirley
takes
life
easily.
Is
not
that
fact
written
in
her
eye?
In
her
good
tempered
moments
is
it
not
as
full
of
lazy
softness
as
in
her
brief
fits
of
anger
it
is
fulgent
with
quick
flashing
fire?
Her
nature
is
in
her
eye.
So
long
as
she
is
calm,
indolence,
indulgence,
humour,
and
tenderness
possess
that
large
gray
sphere;
incense
her,
a
red
ray
pierces
the
dew,
it
quickens
instantly
to
flame.
Ere
the
month
of
July
was
past,
Miss
Keeldar
would
probably
have
started
with
Caroline
on
that
northern
tour
they
had
planned;
but
just
at
that
epoch
an
invasion
befell
Fieldhead.
A
genteel
foraging
party
besieged
Shirley
in
her
castle,
and
compelled
her
to
surrender
at
discretion.
