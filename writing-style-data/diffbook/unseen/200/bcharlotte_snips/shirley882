carelessness
never
compromises
her
refinement.
Indeed,
through
this
very
loophole
of
character,
the
reality,
depth,
genuineness
of
that
refinement
may
be
ascertained.
A
whole
garment
sometimes
covers
meagreness
and
malformation;
through
a
rent
sleeve
a
fair
round
arm
may
be
revealed.
I
have
seen
and
handled
many
of
her
possessions,
because
they
are
frequently
astray.
I
never
saw
anything
that
did
not
proclaim
the
lady
nothing
sordid,
nothing
soiled.
In
one
sense
she
is
as
scrupulous
as,
in
another,
she
is
unthinking.
As
a
peasant
girl,
she
would
go
ever
trim
and
cleanly.
Look
at
the
pure
kid
of
this
little
glove,
at
the
fresh,
unsullied
satin
of
the
bag.

Caroline,
I
fancy,
is
the
soul
of
conscientious
punctuality
and
nice
exactitude.
She
would
precisely
suit
the
domestic
habits
of
a
certain
fastidious
kinsman
of
mine
so
delicate,
dexterous,
quaint,
quick,
quiet
all
done

a
minute,
all
arranged
to
a
strawbreadth.
She
would
suit
Robert.
But
what
could
I
do
with
anything
so
nearly
faultless?
She
is
my
equal,
poor
as
myself.
She
is
certainly
pretty:
