have
heard?"
"About
five
years."
"Well,
my
dear,"
pursued
Mrs.
Pryor,
rising
to
go,
"I
trust
it
is
understood
that
you
will
frequently
come
to
Fieldhead.
I
hope
you
will.
You
must
feel
lonely
here,
having
no
female
relative
in
the
house;
you
must
necessarily
pass
much
of
your
time
in
solitude."
"I
am
inured
to
it.
I
have
grown
up
by
myself.
May
I
arrange
your
shawl
for
you?"
Mrs.
Pryor
submitted
to
be
assisted.
"Should
you
chance
to
require
help
in
your
studies,"
she
said,
"you
may
command
me."
Caroline
expressed
her
sense
of
such
kindness.
"I
hope

you.
I

wish
to

of
use
to
you."
Again
Miss
Helstone
returned
thanks.
She
thought
what
a
kind
heart
was
hidden
under
her
visitor's
seeming
chilliness.
Observing
that
Mrs.
Pryor
again
glanced
with
an
air
of
interest
towards
the
portraits,
as
she
walked
down
the
room,
Caroline
casually
explained:
"The
likeness
that
hangs
near
the
window,
you
will
see,
is
my
uncle,
taken
twenty
years
ago;
the
other,
to
the
left
of
the
mantelpiece,
is
his
brother
James,
my
father."
"They
resemble
each
other
in
some
measure,"
said
Mrs.
Pryor;
"yet
a
difference
