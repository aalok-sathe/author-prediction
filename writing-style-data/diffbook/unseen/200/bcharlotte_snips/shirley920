with
much
flimsy
pomp
of

that
he
had
better
hold
himself
prepared
for
a
return
to
the
south
at
an
early
day,
as
the
important
business
which
had
detained
him
(Mr.
Sympson)
so
long
in
Yorkshire
was
now
on
the
eve
of
fortunate
completion.
His

girdle.
He
was
for
ever
looking
out
of
the
window
and
listening
for
chariot
wheels.
Bluebeard's
wife
