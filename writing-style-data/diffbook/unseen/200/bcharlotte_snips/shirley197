contrary,
demanded
no
respect,
only
flattery.
If
her
admirers
only
told
her
that
she
was
an
angel,
she
would
let
them
treat
her
like
an
idiot.
So
very
credulous
and
frivolous
was
she,
so
very
silly
did
she
become
when
besieged
with
attention,
flattered
and
admired
to
the
proper
degree,
that
there
were
moments
when
Helstone
actually
felt
tempted
to
commit
matrimony
a
second
time,
and
to
try
the
experiment
of
taking
her
for

helpmeet;
but
fortunately
the

left
on

had
once
worn
round
his

evils

existence,
operated
as
a
check
to
his
tenderness,
suppressed
the
sigh
heaving
his
old
iron
lungs,
and
restrained
him
from
whispering
to
Hannah
proposals
it
would
have
been
high
fun
and
great
satisfaction
to
her
to
hear.
It
is
probable
she
would
have
married
him
if
he
had
asked
her;
her
parents
would
have
quite
approved
the
match.
To
them
his
fifty

years,
his
bend
leather

could
have
presented
no
