she
rises
high,
and
glides
all

on

Temptress
terror!
monstrous
likeness
of
ourselves!
Are
you
not
glad,
Caroline,
when
at
last,
and
with
a
wild
shriek,
she
dives?"
"But,
Shirley,
she
is
not
like
us.
We
are
neither
temptresses,
nor
terrors,
nor
monsters."
"Some

while
you
were
talking;
and
is
not
that
the
garden

which
creaks?"
Shirley
stepped
