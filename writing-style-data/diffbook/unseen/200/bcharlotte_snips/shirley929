I
not
say
I
prefer
a
master
one
in
whose
presence
I
shall
feel
obliged
and
disposed
to
be
good;
one
whose
control
my
impatient
temper
must
acknowledge;
a
man
whose
approbation
can
reward,
whose
displeasure
punish
me;
a
man
I
shall
feel
it
impossible
not
to
love,
and
very
possible
to
fear?"
"What
is
there
to
hinder
you
from
doing
all
this
with
Sir
Philip?
He
is
a
baronet
a
man
of
rank,
property,
connections
far
above
yours.
If
you
talk
of
intellect,
he
is
a
poet
he
writes
verses;
which
you,
I
take
it,
cannot
do,
with
all
your
cleverness."
"Neither
his
title,
wealth,
pedigree,
nor
poetry
avail
to
invest
him
with
the
power
I
describe.
These
are
feather
weights;
they
want
ballast.
A
measure
of
sound,
solid,
practical
sense
would
have
stood
him
in
better
stead
with
me."
"You
and
Henry
rave
about
poetry!
You
used
to
catch
fire
like
tinder
on
the
subject
when
you
were
a
girl."
"O
uncle,
there
is
nothing
really
valuable
in
this
world,
there
is
nothing
glorious
in
the
world
to
come
that
is
not
poetry!"
"Marry
a
poet,
then,
in
God's
name!"
"Show
him
me,
and
I
will."
"Sir
Philip."
