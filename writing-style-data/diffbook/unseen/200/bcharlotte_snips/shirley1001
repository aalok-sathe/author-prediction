felt
annoyed
had
he
fondled
a
kitten
in
her
presence.
The
boys
were
standing
about
the
chaise
as
Moore
entered
it;
but
for
them
he
had
no
farewell.
To
Mr.
Yorke
he
only
said,
"You
have
a
good
riddance
of
me.
That
was
an
unlucky
shot
for
you,
Yorke;
it
turned
Briarmains
into
an
hospital.
Come
and
see
me
at
the
cottage
soon."
He
drew
up
the
glass;
the
chaise
rolled
away.
In
half
an
hour
he
alighted
at
his
own
garden
wicket.
Having
paid
the
driver
and
dismissed
the
vehicle,
he
leaned
on
that
wicket
an
instant,
at
once
to
rest
and
to
muse.
"Six
months
ago
I
passed
out
at
this
gate,"
said
he,
"a
proud,
angry,
disappointed
man.
I
come
back
sadder
and
wiser;
weakly
enough,
but
not
worried.
A
cold,
gray,
yet
quiet
world
lies
round
a
world
where,
if
I
hope
little,
I
fear
nothing.
All
slavish
terrors
of
embarrassment
have
left
me.
Let
the
worst
come,
I
can
work,
as
Joe
Scott
does,
for
an
honourable
living;
in
such
doom
I
yet
see
some
hardship
but
no
degradation.
Formerly,
pecuniary
ruin
was
equivalent
in
my
eyes
to
personal
dishonour.
It
is
not
so
now;
