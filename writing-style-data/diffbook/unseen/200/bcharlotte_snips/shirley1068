who
had
shot
him,
and
all
Briarfield
knew.
It
was
no
other
than
Michael
Hartley,
the
half
crazed
weaver
once
before
alluded
to,
a
frantic
Antinomian
in
religion,
and
a
mad
leveller
in
politics.
The
poor
soul
died
of
delirium
tremens
a
year
after
the
attempt
on
Moore,
and
Robert
gave
his
wretched
widow
a
guinea
to
bury
him.
The
winter
is
over
and
gone;
spring
has
followed
with
beamy
and
shadowy,
with
flowery
and
showery
flight.
We
are
now
in
the
heart
of
summer
in
mid
June
the
June
of
1812.
It
is
burning
weather.
The
air
is
deep
azure
and
red
gold.
It
fits
the
time;
it
fits
the
age;
it
fits
the
present
spirit
of
the
nations.
The
nineteenth
century
wantons
in
its
giant
adolescence;
the
Titan
boy
uproots
mountains
in
his
game,
and
hurls
rocks
in
his
wild
sport.
This
summer
Bonaparte
is
in
the
saddle;
he
and
his
host
scour
Russian
deserts.
He
has
with
him
Frenchmen
and
Poles,
Italians
and
children
of
the
Rhine,
six
hundred
thousand
strong.
He
marches
on
old
Moscow.
Under
old
Moscow's
walls
the
rude
Cossack
waits
him.
Barbarian
stoic!
he
waits
without
fear
of
the
boundless
ruin
rolling
on.
