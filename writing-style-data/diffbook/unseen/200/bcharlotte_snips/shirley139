"Never,
hardly;
but
just
to
day,
for
some
reason,
he
has
made
a
difference."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"He
is
come.
I
am
certain
I
saw
Murgatroyd
lead
his
horse
into
the
yard
by
the
back
way,
when
I
went
to
get
some
water
at
the
pump
five

Is

one?"
"Beautiful!
Get
the
coffee
ready.
I'll
finish
cutting
out
that
sleeve
for
you,
and
I'll
give
you
some
trimming
for
it.
I
have
some
narrow
satin
ribbon
of
a
colour
that
will
just
match
it."
"You're
very
kind,
miss."
"Be
quick;
there's
a
good
girl.
But

on
the
hearth:
