it
unjust
to
include
all
poor
working
people
under
the
general
and
insulting
name
of
'the
mob,'
and
continually
to
think
of
them
and
treat
them
haughtily."
"You
are
a
little
democrat,
Caroline.
If
your
uncle
knew,
what
would
he
say?"
"I
rarely
talk
to
my
uncle,
as

and
Hortense,
should
we
love

When

are
sometimes,
can
I
venture
to
be
affectionate
in

"Now,
Lina,
I've

my

both

is
your

Hortense
