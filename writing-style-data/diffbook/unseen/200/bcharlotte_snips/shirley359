oak,
delicate
birch,
glossy
beech,
clustered
in
contrast;
and
ash
trees
stately
as
Saul,
standing
isolated;
and
superannuated
wood
giants
clad
in
bright
shrouds
of
ivy.
Miss
Keeldar,
I
could
guide
you."
"You
would
be
dull
with
me
alone?"
"I
should
not.
I
think
we
should
suit;
and
what
third
person
is
there
whose
presence
would
not
spoil
our
pleasure?"
"Indeed,
I
know
of
none
about
our
own
ages
no
lady
at
least;
and
as
to
gentlemen
"
"An
excursion
becomes
quite
a
different
thing
when
there
are
gentlemen
of
the
party,"
interrupted
Caroline.
"I
agree
with
you
quite
a
different
thing
to
what
we
were
proposing."
"We
were
going
simply
to
see
the
old
trees,
the
old
ruins;
to
pass
a
day
in
old
times,
surrounded
by
olden
silence,
and
above
all
by
quietude."
"You
are
right;
and
the
presence
of
gentlemen
dispels
the
last
charm,
I
think.
If
they
are
of
the
wrong
sort,
like
your
Malones,
and
your
young
Sykes,
and
Wynnes,
irritation
takes
the
place
of
serenity.
If
they
are
of
the
right
sort,
there
is
still
a
change;
I
can
hardly
tell
what
change
one
easy
to
feel,
difficult
to
describe."
"We
forget
Nature,
imprimis."
