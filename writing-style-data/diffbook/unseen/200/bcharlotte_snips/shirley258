happy.
Life
will
never
have
much
joy
in
it
for
Mark.
By
the
time
he
is
five
and
twenty
he
will
wonder
why
people
ever
laugh,
and
think
all
fools
who
seem
merry.
Poetry
will
not
exist
for
Mark,
either
in
literature
or
in
life;
its
best
effusions
will
sound
to
him
mere
rant
and
jargon.
Enthusiasm
will
be
his
aversion
and
contempt.
Mark
will
have
no
youth;
while
he
looks
juvenile
and
blooming,
he
will
be
already
middle
aged
in
mind.
His
body
is
now
fourteen
years
of
age,
but
his
soul
is
already
thirty.
Martin,
the
youngest
of
the
three,
owns
another
nature.
Life
may,
or
may
not,
be
brief
for
him,
but
it
will
certainly
be
brilliant.
He
will
pass
through
all
its
illusions,
half
believe
in
them,
wholly
enjoy
them,
then
outlive
them.
That
boy
is
not
handsome
not
so
handsome
as
either
of
his
brothers.
He
is
plain;
there
is
a
husk
upon
him,
a
dry
shell,
and
he
will
wear
it
till
he
is
near
twenty,
then
he
will
put
it
off.
About
that
period
he
will
make
himself
handsome.
He
will
wear
uncouth
manners
till
that
age,
perhaps
homely
garments;
but
the
chrysalis
