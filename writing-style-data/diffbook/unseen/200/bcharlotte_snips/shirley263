groaned
acquiescence;
but
in
a
minute
she
said,
"I
make
little
account
of
the
wisdom
of
a
Solomon
of
your
age;
it
will
be
upset
by
the
first
fancy
that
crosses
you.
Meantime,
sit
down,
sir.
You
can
talk,
I
suppose,
as
well
sitting
as
standing?"
This
was
her
way
of
inviting
her

blue
sash.
Didn't
he,
father?"
(These
children
were
not
accustomed
to
say
papa
and
mamma;
their
mother
would
allow
no
such
"namby
pamby.")
"Ay,
my
little
lassie,
he
