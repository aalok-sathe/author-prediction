a
ceaseless
talker
when
there
were
only
men
present,
was
usually
tongue
tied
in
the
presence
of
ladies.
Three
phrases,
however,
he
had
ready
cut
and
dried,
which
he
never
failed
to
produce:
1stly.
"Have
you
had
a
walk
to
day,
Miss
Helstone?"
2ndly.
"Have
you
seen
your
cousin
Moore
lately?"

These
three
questions
being
put
and
responded
to,
between
Caroline
and

reigned

With
Donne
it
was
otherwise;
he
was
troublesome,
exasperating.
He
had
a

the

in
these
districts;
murmurings
against
the
disrespectful
conduct
of
the
lower
orders
in
the
north
toward
their
betters;
silly
ridicule
of
the
manner
of
living
in
these
parts
the
want
of
style,
the
absence
of
elegance,
as
if
he,
Donne,
had
been
accustomed
to
very
great
doings
indeed,
an
insinuation
which
his
somewhat
underbred
manner
and
aspect
failed
to
bear
out.
These
strictures,
he
seemed
to
think,
