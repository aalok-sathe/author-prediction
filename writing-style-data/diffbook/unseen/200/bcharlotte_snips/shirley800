He
soon
made
a
call
at
Fieldhead,
and
his
first
visit
was
not
his
last.
He
said
when
he
had
achieved
the
round
of
the
neighbourhood
that
under
no
roof
had
he
found
such
pleasant
shelter
as
beneath
the
massive
oak
beams
of
the
gray
manor
house
of
Briarfield;
a
cramped,
modest
dwelling
enough
compared
with
his
own,
but
he
liked
it.
Presently
it
did
not
suffice
to
sit
with
Shirley
in
her
panelled
parlour,
where
others
came
and
went,
and
where
he
could
rarely
find
a
quiet
moment
to
show
her
the
latest
production
of
his
fertile
muse;
he
must
have
her
out
amongst
the
pleasant
pastures,
and
lead
her
by
the
still
waters.
Tete
a
tete
ramblings
she
shunned,
so
he
made
parties
for
her
to
his
own
grounds,
his
glorious
forest;
to
remoter
scenes
woods
severed
by
the
Wharfe,
vales
watered
by
the
Aire.
Such
assiduity
covered
Miss
Keeldar
with
distinction.
Her
uncle's
prophetic
soul
anticipated
a
splendid
future.
He
already
scented
the
time
afar
off
when,
with
nonchalant
air,
and
left
foot
nursed
on
his
right
knee,
he
should
be
able
to
make
dashingly
familiar
allusion
to
his
"nephew
the
baronet."
Now
his
niece
dawned
upon
