To
my
perception,
a
delicate
splendour
robed
her,
and
the
modesty
of
girlhood
was
her
halo.
I
may
be
the
most
fatuous,
as
I
am
one
of
the
plainest,
of
men,
but
in
truth
that
shyness
of
hers
touched
me
exquisitely;
it
flattered
my
finest
sensations.
I
looked
a

now
looking
up
into
my
face,
and
entreating
me
to
prevent
them
from
smothering
her,
and
to
be
sure
and
give
her
a
strong
narcotic.
I
see
her
confessing
that
she
was
not
so
self

so
independent
of
sympathy,
as
people

see
the
secret
tear
