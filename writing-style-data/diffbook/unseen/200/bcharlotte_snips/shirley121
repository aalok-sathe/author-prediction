a
deep
sigh.
With
this
ejaculation,
indicative
that
she
perceived
a
screw
to
be
loose
somewhere,
but
that
it
was
out
of
her
reach
to
set
it
right,
she
bent
over
her
grammar,
and
sought
the
rule
and
exercise
for
the
day.
"I
suppose
I
am
not
an
affectionate
man,
Caroline.
The
attachment
of
a
very
few
suffices
me."
"If
you
please,
Robert,
will
you
mend

it
in
Skyes's

"You

"More

As
he
finished
mending
the
pens,
a
horse,
saddled
and
bridled,
was
brought
up
to
the
garden

"There,
Fred
