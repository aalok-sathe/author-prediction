trio;
small
English
features
they
all
possess;
all
own
a
blended
resemblance
to
sire
and
mother;
and
yet
a
distinctive
physiognomy,
mark
of
a
separate
character,
belongs
to
each.
I
shall
not
say
much
about
Matthew,
the
first
born
of
the
house,
though
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
gazing
at
him
long,
and
conjecturing
what
qualities
that
visage
hides
or
indicates.
He
is
no
plain
looking
boy:
that
jet
black
hair,
white
brow,
high
coloured
cheek,
those
quick,
dark
eyes,
are
good
points
in
their
way.
How
is
it
that,
look
as
long
as
you
will,
there
is
but
one
object
in
the
room,
and
that
the
most
sinister,
to
which
Matthew's
face
seems
to
bear
an
affinity,
and
of
which,
ever
and
anon,
it
reminds
you
strangely
the
eruption
of
Vesuvius?
Flame
and
shadow
seem
the
component
parts
of
that
lad's
soul
no
daylight
in
it,
and
no
sunshine,
and
no
pure,
cool
moonbeam
ever
shone
there.
He
has
an
English
frame,
but,
apparently,
not
an
English
mind
you
would
say,
an
Italian
stiletto
in
a
sheath
of
British
workmanship.
He
is
crossed
in
the
game
look
at
his
scowl.
Mr.
Yorke
sees
it,
and
what
does
he
say?
