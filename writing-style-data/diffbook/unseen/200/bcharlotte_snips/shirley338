what
was
good
for
the
timid,
took
a
seat
quietly
near
her,
and
began
to
talk
to
her
with
a
gentle
ease,
communicated
for
the
moment
by
the
presence
of
one
less
self
possessed
than
herself.
She
and
this
lady
would,
if
alone,
have
at
once
got
on
extremely
well
together.
The
lady
had
the
clearest
voice
imaginable
infinitely
softer
and
more
tuneful
than
could
have
been
reasonably
expected
from
forty
years
and
a
form
decidedly
inclined
to
embonpoint.
This
voice
Caroline
liked;
it
atoned
for
the
formal,
if
correct,
accent
and
language.
The
lady
would
soon
have
discovered
she
liked
it
and
her,
and
in
ten
minutes
they
would
have
been
friends.
But
Mr.
Helstone
stood
on
the
rug
looking
at
them
both,
looking
especially
at
the
strange
lady
with
his
sarcastic,
keen
eye,
that
clearly
expressed
impatience
of
her
chilly
ceremony,
and
annoyance
at
her
want
of
aplomb.
His
hard
gaze
and
rasping
voice
discomfited
the
lady
more
and
more.
She
tried,
however,
to
get
up
little
speeches
about
the
weather,
the
aspect
of
the
country,
etc.;
but
the
impracticable
Mr.
Helstone
presently
found
himself
somewhat
deaf.
Whatever
she
said
he
affected
not
to
hear
distinctly,
and
she
