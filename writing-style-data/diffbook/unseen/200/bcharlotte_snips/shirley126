reports
which
were
known
to
be
true
concerning
him
had
given
an
air
of
probability
to
those
which
were
falsely
circulated
respecting
his
better
principled
brother.
Caroline
had
never
known
her
mother,
as
she
was
taken
from
her
in
infancy,
and
had
not
since
seen
her;
her
father
died
comparatively
young,
and
her
uncle,
the
rector,
had
for
some
years
been
her
sole
guardian.
He
was
not,
as
we
are
aware,
much
adapted,
either
by
nature
or
habits,
to
have
the
charge
of
a
young
girl.
He
had
taken
little
trouble
about
her
education;
probably
he
would
have
taken
none
if
she,
finding
herself
neglected,
had
not
grown
anxious
on
her
own
account,
and
asked,
every
now
and
then,
for
a
little
attention,
and
for
the
means
of
acquiring
such
amount
of
knowledge
as
could
not
be
dispensed
with.
Still,
she
had
a
depressing
feeling
that
she
was
inferior,
that
her
attainments
were
fewer
than
were
usually
possessed
by
girls
of
her
age
and
station;
and
very
glad
was
she
to
avail
herself
of
the
kind
offer
made
by
her
cousin
Hortense,
soon
after
the
arrival
of
the
latter
at
Hollow's
Mill,
to
teach
her
French
and
fine
needle
work.
