studying
standard
works.
The
other
day
I
put
into
her
hands
a
volume
of
short
fugitive
pieces.
I
sent
her
to
the
window
to
learn
one
by
heart,
and
when
I
looked
up
I
saw
her
turning
the
leaves
over
impatiently,
and
curling
her
lip,
absolutely
with
scorn,
as
she
surveyed
the
little
poems
cursorily.
I
chid
her.
'Ma
cousine,'
said
she,
'tout
cela
m'ennuie
a
la
mort.'
I
told
her
this
was
improper
language.
'Dieu!'
she
exclaimed,
'il
n'y
a
donc
pas
deux
lignes
de
poesie
dans
toute
la
litterature
francaise?'
I
inquired
what
she
meant.
She
begged
my
pardon
with
proper
submission.
Ere
long
she
was
still.
I
saw
her
smiling
to
herself
over
the
book.
She
began
to
learn
assiduously.
In
half
an
hour
she
came
and
stood
before
me,
presented
the
volume,
folded
her
hands,
as
I
always
require
her
to
do,
and
commenced
the
repetition
of
that
short
thing
by
Chenier,
'La
Jeune
Captive.'
If
you
had
heard
the
manner
in
which
she
went
through
this,
and
in
which
she
uttered
a
few
incoherent
comments
when
she
had
done,
you
would
have
known
what
I
meant
by
the
phrase
'unsettled
hurry.'
One
would
have
thought
