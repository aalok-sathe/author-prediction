drunk
by
the
roadside,
as
I
returned
from
Stilbro'
market;
and
while
you
preach
peace,
you
make
it
the
business
of
your
life
to
stir
up
dissension.
You
no
more
sympathize
with
the
poor
who
are
in
distress
than
you
sympathize
with
me.
You
incite
them
to
outrage
for
bad
purposes
of
your
own;
so
does
the
individual
called
Noah
of
Tim's.
You
two
are
restless,
meddling,
impudent
scoundrels,
whose
chief
motive
principle
is
a
selfish
ambition,
as
dangerous
as
it
is
puerile.
The
persons
behind
you
are
some
of
them
honest
though
misguided
men;
but
you
two
I
count
altogether
bad."
Barraclough
was
going

speak.
"Silence!
You
have
had
your
say,
and
now
I
will
have
mine.
As
to
being
dictated
to
by
you,
or
any
Jack,
Jem,
or
Jonathan
on
earth,
I
shall
not
suffer
it
for
a
moment.
You
desire
me
to
quit
the
country;
you
request
me
to
part
with
my
machinery.
In
case
I
refuse,
you
threaten
me.
I
do
refuse
point
blank!
Here
I
stay,
and
by
this
mill
I
stand,
and
into
it
will
I
convey
the
best
machinery
inventors
can
furnish.
What
will
you
do?
The
utmost
you
can
do
and
