only
encourage
disorder,
and
lead
finally
to
sanguinary
outbreaks.
There
is
the
note
I
brought
it
for
your
perusal;
and
there
is
a
batch
of
newspapers,
containing
further
accounts
of
proceedings
in
Nottingham,
Manchester,
and
elsewhere."
He
produced
letters
and
journals,
and
laid
them
before
Miss
Keeldar.
While
she
perused
them

took
his
tea
quietly;
but
though
his
tongue
was
still,

observant
faculties
seemed
by
no
means
off
duty.
Mrs.
Pryor,
sitting
in
the
background,
did
not

two

remained
of
daylight

gilding
of

shape
rose

from
the
dark
panelling
behind.
Shirley's
clear
cheek
was
tinted
yet
with
the
colour
which
had
risen
into
it
a
few
minutes
since.
The
dark
lashes
of
her
eyes
looking
down
as
she
read,
the
dusk
yet
delicate
line
of
her
eyebrows,
the
almost
sable
gloss
of
her
curls,
made
her
heightened
complexion

fine
as
the
bloom
of
a
red
wild
flower
