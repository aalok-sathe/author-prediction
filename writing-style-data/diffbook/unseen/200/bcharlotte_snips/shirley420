There
was
natural
grace
in
her
attitude,
and
there
was
artistic
effect
in
the
ample
and
shining
folds
of
her
silk
dress
an
attire
simply
fashioned,
but
almost
splendid
from
the
shifting
brightness
of
its
dye,
warp
and
woof
being
of
tints
deep
and
changing
as
the
hue
on
a
pheasant's
neck.
A
glancing
bracelet
on

arm
produced
the

of
gold
and
ivory.
There
was
something

picture.
It
is
to
be
supposed
that
Moore
thought
so,
as
his
eye
dwelt
long
on
it,
but
he
seldom
permitted
his
feelings

and
he
preferred
an
undemonstrative,
not
ungentle,
but
serious
aspect
to
any
other.
He
could
not,
by
looking
straight
before
him,
see
Caroline,
as
she
was
close
at
his
side.
It
was
necessary,
therefore,
to
maneauvre
a
little
to
get
her
well
within
the
range
of
his
observation.
He
leaned
back
in
his
chair,
and
looked
down
on
her.
In
Miss
Helstone

he
nor
any
one
else
could
discover
brilliancy.
