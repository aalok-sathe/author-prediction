should
try
to
get
additional
subscriptions,
and
to
form
a
fund;
but
first
she
must
consult
the
clergy.
Yes,
on
that
point
she
was
peremptory.
Mr.
Helstone,
Dr.
Boultby,
Mr.
Hall,
must
be
consulted
(for
not
only
must
Briarfield
be
relieved,
but
Whinbury
and
Nunnely).
It
would,
she
averred,
be
presumption
in
her
to
take
a
single
step
unauthorized
by
them.
The
clergy
were
sacred
beings
in
Miss
Ainley's
eyes;
no
matter
what
might
be
the
insignificance
of
the
individual,
his
station
made
him
holy.
The
very
curates
who,
in
their
trivial
arrogance,
were
hardly
worthy
to
tie
her
patten
strings,
or
carry
her
cotton
umbrella,
or
check
woollen
shawl
she,
in
her
pure,
sincere
enthusiasm,
looked
upon
as
sucking
saints.
No
matter
how
clearly
their
little
vices
and
enormous
absurdities
were
pointed
out
to
her,
she
could
not
see
them;
she
was
blind
to
ecclesiastical
defects;
the
white
surplice
covered
a
multitude
of
sins.
Shirley,
knowing
this
harmless
infatuation
on
the
part
of
her
recently
chosen
prime
minister,
stipulated
expressly
that
the
curates
were
to
have
no
voice
in
the
disposal
of
the
money,
that
their
meddling
fingers
were
not
to
be
inserted
into
the
pie.
