produce
mortal
effects
on
my
constitution.
I
sickened.
The
lady
of
the
house
told
me
coolly
I
was
the
victim
of
'wounded
vanity.'
She
hinted
that
if
I
did
not
make
an
effort
to
quell
my
'ungodly
discontent,'
to
cease
'murmuring
against
God's
appointment,'
and
to
cultivate
the
profound
humility

with
a
manner
it
makes
me
smile
now
to
recall
'but
it
must
be
so.
She'
(Miss
H.)
'had
neither
view,
hope,
nor
wish
to
see
these
things
remedied;
for
in
the
inherent
constitution
of
English
habits,
feelings,
and
prejudices
there
was
no
possibility
that
they
should

Governesses,'
she
observed,
