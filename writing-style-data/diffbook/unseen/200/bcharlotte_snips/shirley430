the
white
sprays
of
hawthorn
I
shall
imagine
glimpses
of
you.
Lina,
you
will
haunt
me."
"I
will
never
be
where
you
would
not
wish
me
to
be,
nor
see
nor
hear
what
you
would
wish
unseen
and
unheard."
"I
shall
see
you
in
my
very
mill
in
broad
daylight.
Indeed,
I
have
seen
you
there
once.
But
a
week
ago
I
was
standing
at
the
top
of
one
of
my
long
rooms;
girls
were
working

sought
had
glided
away;
I
found
myself
between
two
buxom
lasses
in
pinafores."
"I
shall
not
follow
you
into
your
mill,
Robert,
unless
you
call
me
there."
"Nor
is
that
the
only
occasion
on
which
imagination
has
played
me
a
trick.
One
night,
when
I
came
home
late
from
market,
I
walked
into
the
cottage
parlour
thinking
to
find
Hortense;
but
instead
of
her
I
thought
I
found
you.
There
was
no
candle
in
the
room;
my
sister
had
