the
admission
of
sunshine
to
its
cage.
It
was
of
no
use
arguing,
contending
against
the
sense
of
present
happiness;
to
be
near
Robert
was
to
be
revived.
Miss
Keeldar
laid
down
the
papers.
"And
are
you
glad
or
sad
for
all
these
menacing
tidings?"
she
inquired
of
her
tenant.
"Not
precisely
either;
but
I
certainly
am
instructed.
I
see
that
our
only
plan
is
to
be
firm.
I
see
that
efficient
preparation
and
a
resolute
attitude
are
the
best
means
of
averting
bloodshed."
He
then
inquired
if
she
had
observed
some
particular
paragraph,
to
which
she
replied
in
the
negative,
and
he
rose
to
show
it
to
her.
He
continued
the
conversation
standing
before
her.
From
the
tenor
of
what
he
said,
it
appeared
evident
that
they
both
apprehended
disturbances
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Briarfield,
though
in
what
form
they
expected
them
to
break
out
was
not
specified.
Neither
Caroline
nor
Mrs.
Pryor
asked
questions.
The
subject
did
not
appear
to
be
regarded
as
one
ripe
for
free
discussion;
therefore
the
lady
and
her
tenant
were
suffered
to
keep
details
to
themselves,
unimportuned
by
the
curiosity
of
their
listeners.
Miss
Keeldar,
in
speaking
to
Mr.
Moore,
took
