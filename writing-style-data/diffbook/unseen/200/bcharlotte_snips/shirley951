his
keeper,
the
three
surgeons
his
sole
society.
Thus
he
lay
through
the
diminishing
days
and
lengthening
nights
of
the
whole
drear
month
of
November.
In
the
commencement
of
his
captivity
Moore
used
feebly
to
resist
Mrs.
Horsfall.
He
hated
the
sight
of
her
rough
bulk,
and
dreaded
the
contact
of
her
hard
hands;
but
she
taught
him
docility
in
a
trice.
She
made
no
account
whatever
of
his
six
feet,
his
manly
thews
and
sinews;
she
turned
him
in
his
bed
as
another
woman
would
have
turned
a
babe
in
its

When
he
was
good

addressed
him
as
"my

and
"honey,"
and
when
he
was
bad
she
sometimes
shook
him.
Did
he
attempt
to

when
MacTurk
was
there,
she
lifted
her
hand
and
bade
him
"Hush!"
like
a
nurse
checking
a
forward
child.
If
she
had
not
smoked,
if
she
had
not
taken
gin,
it
would
have
been
better,
he
thought;
but
she
did
both.
Once,
in
her
absence,
he
intimated
to
MacTurk
that
"that
woman
was
a
dram
drinker."
"Pooh!
my
dear
sir,
they
are
all
so,"
was
the
reply
he
got
for
his
pains.
"But
Horsfall
has
this
virtue,"
added
the
surgeon
"drunk
