Moore,
for
her
part,
delighted
in
the
task,
because
it
gave
her
importance;
she
liked
to
lord
it
a
little
over
a
docile
yet
quick
pupil.
She
took
Caroline
precisely
at
her
own
estimate,
as
an
irregularly
taught,
even
ignorant
girl;
and
when
she
found
that
she
made
rapid
and
eager
progress,
it
was
to
no
talent,
no
application,
in
the
scholar
she
ascribed
the
improvement,
but
entirely
to
her
own
superior
method
of
teaching.
When
she
found
that
Caroline,
unskilled
in
routine,
had
a
knowledge
of
her
own,
desultory
but
varied,
the
discovery
caused
her
no
surprise,
for
she
still
imagined
that
from
her
conversation
had
the
girl
unawares
gleaned
these
treasures.
She
thought
it
even
when
forced
to
feel
that
her
pupil
knew
much
on
subjects
whereof
she
knew
little.
The
idea
was
not
logical,
but
Hortense
had
perfect
faith
in
it.
Mademoiselle,
who
prided
herself
on
possessing
"un
esprit
positif,"
and
on
entertaining
a
decided
preference
for
dry
studies,
kept
her
young
cousin
to
the
same
as
closely
as
she
could.
She
worked
her
unrelentingly
at
the
grammar
of
the
French
language,
assigning
her,
as
the
most
improving
exercise
she
could
devise,
interminable
"analyses
logiques."
