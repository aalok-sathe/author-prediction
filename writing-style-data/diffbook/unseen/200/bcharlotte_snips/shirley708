to
address
another,
it
excited
her.
Her
discourse
flowed
freely;
it
was
gay,
playful,
eloquent.
The
indulgent
look
and
placid
manner
of
her
auditor
encouraged
her
to
ease;
the
sober
pleasure
expressed
by
his
smile
drew
out
all
that
was
brilliant
in
her
nature.
She
felt
that
this
evening
she
appeared
to
advantage,
and
as
Robert
was
a
spectator,
the
consciousness
contented
her.
Had
he
been
called
away,
collapse
would
at
once
have
succeeded
stimulus.
But
her
enjoyment
was
not
long
to
shine
full
orbed;
a
cloud
soon
crossed
it.
Hortense,
who
for
some
time
had
been
on
the
move
ordering
supper,
and
was
now
clearing
the
little
table
of
some
books,
etc.,
to
make
room
for
the
tray,
called
Robert's
attention
to
the
glass
of
flowers,
the
carmine
and
snow
and
gold
of
whose
petals
looked
radiant
indeed
by
candlelight.
"They
came
from
Fieldhead,"
she
said,
"intended
as
a
gift
to
you,
no
doubt.
We
know
who
is
the
favourite
there;
not
I,
I'm
sure."
It
was
a
wonder
to
hear
Hortense
jest
a
sign
that
her
spirits
were
at
high
water
mark
indeed.
"We
are
to
understand,
then,
that
Robert
is
the
favourite?"
observed
Louis.
"Mon
cher,"
replied
