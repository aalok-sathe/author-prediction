due
time
the
tea
was
spread
forth
in
handsome
style,
and
neither
ham,
tarts,
nor
marmalade
were
wanting
among
its
accompaniments.
The
curates,
summoned
to
this
bounteous
repast,
entered
joyous;
but
at
once,
on
seeing
the
ladies,
of
whose
presence
they
had
not
been
forewarned,
they
came
to
a
stand
in
the
doorway.
Malone
headed
the
party;
he
stopped
short
and
fell
back,
almost
capsizing
Donne,
who
was
behind
him.
Donne,
staggering
three
paces
in
retreat,
sent
little
Sweeting
into
the
arms
of
old
Helstone,
who
brought
up
the
rear.
There
was
some
expostulation,
some
tittering.
Malone
was
desired
to
mind
what
he
was
about,
and
urged
to
push
forward,
which
at
last
he
did,
though
colouring
to
the
top
of
his
peaked
forehead
a
bluish
purple.
Helstone,
advancing,
set
the
shy
curates
aside,
welcomed
all
his
fair
guests,
shook
hands
and
passed
a
jest
with
each,
and
seated
himself
snugly
between
the
lovely
Harriet
and
the
dashing
Hannah.
Miss
Mary
he
requested
to
move
to
the
seat
opposite
to
him,
that
he
might
see
her
if
he
couldn't
be
near
her.
Perfectly
easy
and
gallant,
in
his
way,
were
his
manners
always
to
young
ladies,
and
most
popular
was
