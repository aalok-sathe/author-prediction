borne
from
their
drowning
comrade
by
'the
furious
blast.'"
"You
may
be
right.
Who
told
you
this?"
"And
what
I
say
of
Cowper,
I
should
say
of
Rousseau.
Was
Rousseau
ever
loved?
He
loved
passionately;
but
was
his
passion
ever
returned?
I
am
certain,
never.
And
if
there
were
any
female
Cowpers
and
Rousseaus,
I
should
assert
the
same
of
them."
"Who
told
you
this,
I
ask?
Did
Moore?"
"Why
should
anybody
have
told
me?
Have
I
not
an
instinct?
Can
I
not
divine
by
analogy?
Moore
never
talked
to
me
either
about
Cowper,
or
Rousseau,
or
love.
The
voice
we
hear
in
solitude
told
me
all
I
know
on
these
subjects."
"Do
you
like
characters
of
the
Rousseau
order,
Caroline?"
"Not
at
all,
as
a
whole.
I
sympathize
intensely
with
certain
qualities
they
possess.
Certain
divine
sparks
in
their
nature
dazzle
my
eyes,
and
make
my
soul
glow.
Then,
again,
I
scorn
them.
They
are
made
of
clay
and
gold.
The
refuse
and
the
ore
make
a
mass
of
weakness:
taken
altogether,
I
feel
them
unnatural,
unhealthy,
repulsive."
"I
dare
say
I
should
be
more
tolerant
of
a
Rousseau
than
you
would,
Cary.
Submissive
and
contemplative
yourself,
you
