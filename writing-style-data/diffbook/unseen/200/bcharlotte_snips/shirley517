What
does
Miss
Keeldar
say?"
"She
asks
what
is
it."
"The
Dissenting
and
Methodist
schools,
the
Baptists,
Independents,
and
Wesleyans,
joined
in
unholy
alliance,
and
turning
purposely
into
this
lane
with
the
intention
of
obstructing
our
march
and
driving
us
back."
"Bad
manners!"
said
Shirley,
"and
I
hate
bad
manners.
Of
course,
they
must
have
a
lesson."
"A
lesson
in
politeness,"
suggested
Mr.
Hall,
who
was
ever
for
peace;
"not
an
example
of
rudeness."
Old
Helstone
moved
on.
Quickening
his
step,
he
marched
some
yards
in
advance
of
his
company.
He
had
nearly
reached
the
other
sable
leaders,
when
he
who
appeared
to
act
as
the
hostile
commander
in
chief
a
large,
greasy
man,
with
black
hair
combed
flat
on
his
forehead
called
a
halt.
The
procession
paused.
He
drew
forth
a
hymn
book,
gave
out
a
verse,
set
a
tune,
and
they
all
struck
up
the
most
dolorous
of
canticles.
Helstone
signed
to
his
bands.
They
clashed
out
with
all
the
power
of
brass.
He
desired
them
to
play
"Rule,
Britannia!"
and
ordered
the
children
to
join
in
vocally,
which
they
did
with
enthusiastic
spirit.
The
enemy
was
sung
and
stormed
down,
his
psalm
quelled.
As
far
as
noise
