order
them
to
stay
at
home.
What
do
they
expect
them
to
do
at
home?
If
you
ask,
they
would
answer,
sew
and
cook.
They
expect
them
to
do
this,
and
this
only,
contentedly,
regularly,
uncomplainingly,
all
their
lives
long,
as
if
they
had
no
germs
of
faculties
for
anything
else
a
doctrine
as
reasonable
to
hold
as
it
would
be
that
the
fathers
have
no
faculties
but
for
eating
what
their
daughters
cook
or
for
wearing
what
they
sew.
Could
men
live
so
themselves?
Would
they
not
be
very

there
came
no
relief
to
their
weariness,
but
only
reproaches
at
its
slightest
manifestation,
would
not
their
weariness
ferment
it
time
to
frenzy?
Lucretia,
spinning
at

in
the
midst
of
her
maidens,
and
Solomon's
virtuous
woman
are
often
quoted
as
patterns
of
what
'the
sex,'
as
they
say,
ought
to
be.
I
don't
know.
Lucretia,
I
dare
say,
was
a
most
worthy
sort
of
person,
much
like
my
cousin
Hortense
Moore;
but
she
kept
her
servants
up
very
late.
I
should
not
have
liked
to
be
amongst
the
number
of
the
maidens.
Hortense
would
just
work
me
and
Sarah
in
that
fashion,
if
she
could,
and
