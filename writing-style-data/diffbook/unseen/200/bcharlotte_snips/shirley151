science,
since
we
are
going
to
study?"
"It
appears
so."
"And
you
are
not
going
to
be
French,
and
sceptical,
and
sneering?
You
are
not
going
to
think
it
a
sign
of
wisdom
to
refuse
to
admire?"
"I
don't
know."
"If
you
do,
Robert,
I'll
take
Shakespeare
away;
and
I'll
shrivel
up
within
myself,
and
put
on
my
bonnet
and
go
home."
"Sit
down.
Here
I
begin."
"One
minute,
if
you
please,
brother,"
interrupted
mademoiselle.
"When
the
gentleman
of
a
family
reads,
the
ladies
should
always
sew.
Caroline,
dear
child,
take
your
embroidery.
You
may
get
three
sprigs
done
to
night."
Caroline
looked
dismayed.
"I
can't
see
by
lamp
light;
my
eyes
are
tired,
and
I
can't
do
two
things
well
at
once.
If
I
sew,
I
cannot
listen;
if
I
listen,
I
cannot
sew."
"Fi,
donc!
Quel
enfantillage!"
began
Hortense.
Mr.
Moore,
as
usual,
suavely
interposed.
"Permit
her
to
neglect
the
embroidery
for
this
evening.
I
wish
her
whole
attention
to
be
fixed
on
my
accent;
and
to
ensure
this,
she
must
follow
the
reading
with
her
eyes
she
must
look
at
the
book."
He
placed
it
between
them,
reposed
his
arm
on
the
back
of
Caroline's
chair,
and
