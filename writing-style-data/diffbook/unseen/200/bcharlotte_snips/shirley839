her
land.
Others
conjectured
that
she
was
going
to
be
married,
and
that
the
settlements
were
preparing.
Mr.
Moore
and
Henry
Sympson
were
together
in
the
schoolroom.
The
tutor
was
waiting
for
a
lesson
which
the
pupil
seemed
busy
in
preparing.
"Henry,
make
haste.
The
afternoon
is
getting
on."
"Is
it,
sir?"
"Certainly.
Are
you
nearly
ready
with
that
lesson?"
"No."
"Not
nearly
ready?"
"I
have
not
construed
a
line."
Mr.
Moore
looked
up.
The
boy's
tone
was
rather
peculiar.
"The
task
presents
no
difficulties,
Henry;
or,
if
it
does,
bring
them
to
me.
We
will
work
together."
"Mr.
Moore,
I
can
do
no
work."
"My
boy,
you
are
ill."
"Sir,
I
am
not
worse
in
bodily
health
than
usual,
but
my
heart
is
full."
"Shut
the
book.
Come
hither,
Harry.
Come
to
the
fireside."
Harry
limped
forward.
His
tutor
placed
him
in
a
chair;
his
lips
were
quivering,
his
eyes
brimming.
He
laid
his
crutch
on
the
floor,
bent
down
his
head,
and
wept.
"This
distress
is
not
occasioned
by
physical
pain,
you
say,
Harry?
You
have
a
grief;
tell
it
me."
"Sir,
I
have
such
a
grief
as
I
never
had
before.
I
wish
it
could
be
relieved
