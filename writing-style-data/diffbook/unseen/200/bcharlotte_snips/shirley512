to
them
as
Dr.
Thomas
Boultby
to
his
admirers.
A
throng,
too,
enclosed
the
rector
of
Briarfield
twenty
or
more
pressed
round
him;
and
no
parson
was
ever
more
potent
in
a
circle
than
old
Helstone.
The
curates,
herding
together
after
their
manner,
made
a
constellation
of
three
lesser
planets.
Divers
young
ladies
watched
them
afar
off,
but
ventured
not
nigh.
Mr.
Helstone
produced
his
watch.
"Ten
minutes
to
two,"
he
announced
aloud.
"Time
for
all
to
fall
into
line.
Come."
He
seized
his
shovel
hat
and
marched
away.
All
rose
and
followed
en
masse.
The
twelve
hundred
children
were
drawn
up
in
three
bodies
of
four
hundred
souls
each;
in
the
rear
of
each
regiment
was
stationed
a
band;
between
every
twenty
there
was
an
interval,
wherein
Helstone
posted
the
teachers
in
pairs.
To
the
van
of
the
armies
he
summoned,
"Grace
Boultby
and
Mary
Sykes
lead
out
Whinbury.
"Margaret
Hall
and
Mary
Ann
Ainley
conduct
Nunnely.
"Caroline
Helstone
and
Shirley
Keeldar
head
Briarfield."
Then
again
he
gave
command,
"Mr.
Donne
to
Whinbury;
Mr.
Sweeting
to
Nunnely;
Mr.
Malone
to
Briarfield."
And
these
gentlemen
stepped
up
before
the
lady
generals.
The
rectors
passed
to
the
full
front;
the
parish
