going
to
commit,
a
crime.
It
is
not
my
private
conscience,
you
must
understand,
but
my
landed
proprietor
and
lord
of
the
manor
conscience.
I
have
got
into
the
clutch
of
an
eagle
with
iron
talons.
I
have
fallen
under
a
stern
influence,
which
I
scarcely
approve,
but
cannot
resist.
Something
will
be
done
ere
long,
I
fear,
which
it
by
no
means
pleases
me
to

of.
To

my
mind,
and
to

and
just
ask
that
excellent
person,
Miss
Ainley,
to
step
up
to
Fieldhead.
I
have
some
notion
of
putting
myself
under
her
tuition.
Won't
she
have
a
precious
pupil?
Drop
a
hint
to
her,
Lina,
that,
though
a
well
meaning,
I
am
rather
a
neglected
character,
and
then
she
will
feel
less
scandalized
at
my
ignorance
about
clothing
societies
and
such
things."
On
