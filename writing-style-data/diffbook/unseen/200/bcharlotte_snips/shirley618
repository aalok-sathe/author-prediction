"However,
there
is
nothing
masculine
about
her?"
"Why
lay
such
emphasis
on
her?
Do
you
consider
her
a
contrast,
in
that
respect,
to
yourself?"
"You
do,
no
doubt;
but
that
does
not
signify.
Caroline
is
neither
masculine,
nor
of
what
they
call
the
spirited
order
of
women."
"I
have
seen
her
flash
out."
"So
have
I,
but
not
with
manly
fire.
It
was
a
short,
vivid,
trembling
glow,
that
shot
up,
shone,
vanished
"
"And
left
her
scared
at
her
own
daring.
You
describe
others
besides
Caroline."
"The
point
I
wish
to
establish
is,
that
Miss
Helstone,
though
gentle,
tractable,
and

enough,
is
still
perfectly
capable
of
defying
even
Mr.
Moore's
penetration."
"What
have
you
and
she
been
doing?"
asked
Moore
suddenly.
"Have
you
had
any
breakfast?"
"What
is
your
mutual
mystery?"
"If
you
are
hungry,
Mrs.
Gill
will
give
you
something
to
eat
here.
Step
into
the
oak
parlour,
and
ring
the
bell.
You
will
be
served
as
if
at
an
inn;
or,
if
you
like
better,
go
back
to
the
Hollow."
"The
alternative
is
not
open
to
me;
I
must
go
back.
Good

first
leisure
I
have

will
see
you
again."
