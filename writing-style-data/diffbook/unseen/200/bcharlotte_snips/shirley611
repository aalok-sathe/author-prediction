this
house
contains
is
at
Mr.
Moore's,
Mr.
Helstone's,
and
the
soldiers'
service.
Do
that
first."
While
the
order
was
being
executed,
Shirley
moved
away
from
her
friends,
and
stood
at
the
hall
window,
silent,
unapproachable.
When
Mrs.
Gill
came
back,
she
turned.
The
purple
flush
which
painful
excitement
kindles
on
a
pale
cheek
glowed
on
hers;
the
spark
which
displeasure
lights
in
a
dark
eye
fired
her
glance.
"Let
the
contents
of
the
larder
and
the
wine
cellar
be
brought
up,
put
into
the
hay
carts,
and
driven
down
to
the
Hollow.
If
there
does
not
happen
to
be
much
bread
or
much
meat
in
the
house,
go
to
the
butcher
and
baker,
and
desire
them
to
send
what
they
have.
But
I
will
see
for
myself."
She
moved
off.
"All
will
be
right
soon;
she
will
get
over
it
in
an
hour,"
whispered
Caroline
to
Mrs.
Pryor.
"Go
upstairs,
dear
madam,"
she
added
affectionately,
"and
try
to
be
as
calm
and
easy
as
you
can.
The
truth
is,
Shirley
will
blame
herself
more
than
you
before
the
day
is
over."
By
dint
of
a
few
more
gentle
assurances
and
persuasions,
Miss
Helstone
contrived
to
soothe
the
agitated
lady.
