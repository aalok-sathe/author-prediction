had
spent
with
him
in
a
great
town
somewhere,
when
she
had
had
no
maid
to
dress
her
or
take
care
of
her;
when
she
had
been
shut
up,
day
and
night,
in
a
high
garret
room,
without
a
carpet,
with
a
bare
uncurtained
bed,
and
scarcely
any
other
furniture;
when
he
went
out
early
every
morning,
and
often
forgot
to
return
and
give
her
her
dinner
during
the
day,
and
at
night,
when
he
came
back,
was
like
a
madman,
furious,
terrible,
or
still
more
painful
like
an
idiot,
imbecile,
senseless.
She
knew
she
had
fallen
ill
in
this
place,
and
that
one
night,
when
she
was
very
sick
he
had
come
raving
into
the
room,
and
said
he
would
kill
her,
for
she
was
a
burden
to
him.
Her
screams
had
brought
aid;
and
from
the
moment
she
was
then
rescued
from
him
she
had
never
seen
him,
except
as
a
dead
man
in
his
coffin.
That
was
her
father.
Also
she
had
a
mother,
though
Mr.
Helstone
never
spoke
to
her
of
that
mother,
though
she
could
not
remember
having
seen
her;
but
that
she
was
alive
she
knew.
This
mother
was
then
the
drunkard's
wife.
