man
or
woman
can
ever
find
a
safe
track
through
life's
wilds;
without
it,
how
they
stumble,
how
they
stray!
On
what
forbidden
grounds
do
they
intrude,
down
what
dread
declivities
are
they
hurled!
Caroline,
having
been
convoyed
home
by
Robert,
had
no
wish
to
pass
what
remained
of
the
evening
with
her
uncle.
The
room
in
which
he
sat
was
very
sacred
ground
to
her;
she
seldom
intruded
on
it;
and
to
night
she
kept
aloof
till
the
bell
rang
for

Part
of
the
evening
church
service
was
the
form

all

visiting,
dining
out,
and
what
not!"
"Only
at
the
cottage."
"And
have
you
learned
your
lessons?"
"Yes."
"And
made
a
shirt?"
"Only
part
of
one."
"Well,
that
will
do.
Stick
to
the
needle,
learn
shirt
making
and
gown
making
and
piecrust
making,
and
you'll
be
a
clever
woman
some
day.
Go
to
bed
now.
I'm
busy
with
a
pamphlet

niece
