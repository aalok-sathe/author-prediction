meet
they
quarrel.
It
is
not
religion
the
thing
is
never
named
amongst
them;
theology
they
may
discuss
occasionally,
but
piety
never.
It
is
not
the
love
of
eating
and
drinking:
each
might
have
as
good
a
joint
and
pudding,
tea
as
potent,
and
toast
as
succulent,
at
his
own
lodgings,
as
is
served
to
him
at
his
brother's.
Mrs.
Gale,
Mrs.
Hogg,
and
Mrs.
Whipp
their
respective
landladies
affirm
that
"it
is
just
for
naught
else
but
to
give
folk
trouble."
By
"folk"
the
good
ladies
of
course
mean
themselves,
for
indeed
they
are
kept
in
a
continual
"fry"
by
this
system
of
mutual
invasion.
Mr.
Donne
and
his
guests,
as
I
have
said,
are
at
dinner;
Mrs.
Gale
waits
on
them,
but
a
spark
of
the
hot
kitchen
fire
is
in
her
eye.
She
considers
that
the
privilege
of
inviting
a
friend
to
a
meal
occasionally,
without
additional
charge
(a
privilege
included
in
the
terms
on
which
she
lets
her
lodgings),
has
been
quite
sufficiently
exercised
of
late.
The
present
week
is
yet
but
at
Thursday,
and
on
Monday
Mr.
Malone,
the
curate
of
Briarfield,
came
to
breakfast
and
stayed
dinner;
on
Tuesday
Mr.
Malone
and
Mr.
Sweeting
