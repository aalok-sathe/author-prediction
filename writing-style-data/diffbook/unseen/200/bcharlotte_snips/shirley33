large
as
Fieldhead."
"Do
you
know
what
I
heard,
Moore,
the
other
day?"
"No.
Perhaps
that
I
was
about
to
effect
some
such
change.
Your
Briarfield
gossips
are
capable
of
saying
that
or
sillier
things."
"That
you
were
going
to
take
Fieldhead
on
a
lease
(I
thought
it
looked
a
dismal
place,
by
the
bye,
to

as
I
passed
it),
and
that
it

two
Misses
Wynns
first
the
dark,
then
the
light
one;
now
the
red

Miss
Armitage;
then
the
mature
Ann
Pearson.
At
present
you
throw
on
my
shoulders
all
the
tribe
of
the
Misses
Sykes.
On
what
grounds
this
gossip
rests
God
knows.
I
visit
nowhere;
I
seek
female
society
about
as
assiduously
as
you
do,
Mr.
Malone.
If
ever
I
go
to
Whinbury,
it
is
