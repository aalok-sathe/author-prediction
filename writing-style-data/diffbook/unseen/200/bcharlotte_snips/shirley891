party,
and
took
the
road.
In
less
than
five
minutes
Mr.
Yorke
followed
him.
They
rode
out
of
Stilbro'
together.
It
was
early
to
go
home,
but
yet
it
was
late
in
the
day.
The
last
ray
of
the
sun
had
already
faded
from
the
cloud
edges,
and
the
October
night
was
casting
over
the
moorlands
the
shadow
of
her
approach.
Mr.
Yorke,
moderately
exhilarated
with
his
moderate
libations,
and
not
displeased
to
see
young
Moore
again
in
Yorkshire,
and
to
have
him
for
his
comrade
during
the

he
attacked
Moore
on
his
own
personal
concerns.
"Bob,
I
believe
you
are
worsted,
and
you
deserve
it.
All
was
smooth.
Fortune
had
fallen
in
love
with
you.
She
had
decreed
you
the
first
prize
in
her
wheel
twenty
thousand
pounds;
she
only
required
that
you
should
hold
your
hand
out
and
take
it.
And
what
did
you
do?
You
called
for
a
horse
and
rode
a
hunting
to
Warwickshire.
Your
sweetheart
Fortune,
I
mean
was
perfectly
indulgent.
She
said,
