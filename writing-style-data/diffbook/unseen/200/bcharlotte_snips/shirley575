could
grope
my
way
upstairs,
and
I
know
his
chamber."
"How
would
you
manage
about
the
women
folk?"
"Let
'em
alone
except
they
shrieked,
and
then
I'd
soon
quieten
'em.
I
could
wish
to
find
the
old
chap
asleep.
If
he
waked,
he'd
be
dangerous."
"Has
he
arms?"
"Firearms,
allus
and
allus
loadened."
"Then
you're
a
fool
to
stop
us
here.
A
shot
would
give
the
alarm.
Moore
would
be
on
us
before
we
could
turn
round.
We
should
miss
our
main
object."
"You
might
go
on,
I
tell
you.
I'd
engage
Helstone
alone."
A
pause.
One
of
the
party
dropped
some
weapon,
which
rang
on
the
stone
causeway.
At
this
sound
the
rectory
dog
barked
again
furiously
fiercely.
"That
spoils
all!"
said
the
voice.
"He'll
awake.
A
noise
like
that
might
rouse
the
dead.
You
did
not
say
there
was
a
dog.
Damn
you!
Forward!"
Forward
they
went
tramp,
tramp
with
mustering,
manifold,
slow
filing
tread.
They
were
gone.
Shirley
stood
erect,
looked
over
the
wall,
along
the
road.
"Not
a
soul
remains,"
she
said.
She
stood
and
mused.
"Thank
God!"
was
the
next
observation.
Caroline
repeated
the
ejaculation
not
in
so
steady
a
tone.
She
was
trembling
much.
