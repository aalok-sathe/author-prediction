earnest.
Let
us
have
a
confession
of
faith
on
the
spot."
And
he
took
the
heiress's
two
hands
causing
her
to
let
fall
her
whole
cargo
of
flowers
and
seated
her
by
him
on
the
sofa.
"Say
your
creed,"
he
ordered.
"The
Apostles'
Creed?"
"Yes."
She
said
it
like
a
child.
"Now
for
St.
Athanasius's.
That's
the
test!"
"Let
me
gather
up
my
flowers.
Here

Tartar
coming;

Tartar
was
a
rather
large,
strong,
and
fierce

dog,
very
ugly,

he
was
turning
round
preparatory
to
depositing
his
tawny
bulk
upon
them,
when
Miss
Helstone
and
Miss
Keeldar
simultaneously
stooped
to
the
rescue.
"Thank
you,"
said
the
heiress,
as
she
again
held
out
her
little
apron
for
Caroline
to
heap
the
blossoms
into
it.
"Is
this
your
daughter,
Mr.
Helstone?"
she
asked.
"My
niece
Caroline."
Miss
Keeldar
shook
hands
with
her,
and
then
looked
