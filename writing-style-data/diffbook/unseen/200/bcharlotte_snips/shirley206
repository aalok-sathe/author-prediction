and
leave
it
for
him."
Now,
having
caught
these
words,
and
hearing
him
advance,
Caroline,
if
there
was
a
door
within
the
dining
room,
would
glide
through
it
and
disappear.
She
feels
caught,
hemmed
in;
she
dreads
her
unexpected
presence
may
annoy
him.
A
second
since
she
would
have
flown
to
him;
that
second
past,
she
would
flee
from
him.
She
cannot.
There
is
no
way
of
escape.
The
dining
room
has
but
one
door,
through
which
now
enters
her
cousin.
The
look
of
troubled
surprise

expected
to
see

and
is
gone.
She
has
stammered
a
sort
of
apology:
"I
only

minute
for
a
little
quiet."
There
was
something
so
diffident
and
downcast
in
the
air
and
tone
with
which
she
said
this,
any
one
might
perceive
that
some
saddening
change
had
lately
passed
over
her
prospects,
and
that
the
faculty
of
cheerful
self
possession
had
left
her.
Mr.
Moore,
probably,
remembered
how
she
had
formerly
been
accustomed
to
meet
him
with
gentle
ardour
and
hopeful
confidence.
He
must
have
seen
how
the
check
of
this
morning
had
operated.
Here
was
an
opportunity
for
carrying
