volente,"
said
he.
"I
have
occupied
the
place
on
her
right
hand
at
these
monster
tea
drinkings
for
the
last
six
years,"
he
proceeded,
turning
to
Miss
Keeldar.
"They
made
her
a
Sunday
school
teacher
when
she
was
a
little
girl
of
twelve.
She
is
not
particularly
self
confident
by
nature,
as
you
may
have
observed;
and
the
first
time
she
had
to
'take
a
tray,'
as
the
phrase
is,
and
make
tea
in
public,
there
was
some
piteous
trembling
and
flushing.
I
observed
the
speechless
panic,
the
cups
shaking
in
the
little
hand,
and
the
overflowing
teapot
filled
too
full
from
the
urn.
I
came
to
her
aid,
took
a
seat
near
her,
managed
the
urn
and
the
slop
basin,
and
in
fact
made
the
tea
for
her
like
any
old
woman."
"I
was
very
grateful
to
you,"
interposed
Caroline.
"You
were.
You
told
me
so
with
an
earnest
sincerity
that
repaid
me
well,
inasmuch
as
it
was
not
like
the
majority
of
little
ladies
of
twelve,
whom
you
may
help
and
caress
for
ever
without
their
evincing
any
quicker
sense
of
the
kindness
done
and
meant
than
if
they
were
made
of
wax
and
wood
instead
of
flesh
