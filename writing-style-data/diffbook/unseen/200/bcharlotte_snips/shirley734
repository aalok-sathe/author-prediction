saw
none
knew.
There
was
no
sympathy,
no
redemption,
no
redress!"
"Take
comfort,
mother.
It
is
over
now."
"It
is
over,
and
not
fruitlessly.
I
tried
to
keep
the
word
of
His
patience.
He
kept
me
in
the
days
of
my
anguish.
I
was
afraid
with
terror
I
was
troubled.
Through
great
tribulation
He
brought
me
through
to
a
salvation
revealed
in
this
last
time.
My
fear
had
torment;
He
has
cast
it
out.
He
has
given
me
in
its
stead
perfect
love.
But,
Caroline
"
Thus
she
invoked
her
daughter
after
a
pause.
"Mother!"
"I
charge
you,
when
you
next
look
on
your
father's
monument,
to
respect
the
name
chiselled
there.
To
you
he
did
only
good.
On
you
he
conferred
his
whole
treasure
of
beauties,
nor
added
to
them
one
dark
defect.
All
you
derived
from
him
is
excellent.
You
owe
him
gratitude.
Leave,
between
him
and
me,
the
settlement
of
our
mutual
account.
Meddle
not.
God
is
the
arbiter.
This
world's
laws
never
came
near
us
never!
They
were
powerless
as
a
rotten
bulrush
to
protect
me
impotent
as
idiot
babblings
to
restrain
him!
As
you
said,
it
is
all
over
now;
the
grave
lies
between
us.
