Hortense,
"Robert
c'est
tout
ce
qu'il
y
a
de
plus
precieux
au
monde;
a
cote
de
lui
le
reste
du
genre
humain
n'est
que
du
rebut.
N'ai
je
pas
raison,
mon
enfant?"
she
added,
appealing
to
Caroline.
Caroline
was
obliged
to
reply,
"Yes,"
and
her
beacon
was
quenched.
Her
star
withdrew
as
she
spoke.
"Et
toi,
Robert?"
inquired
Louis.
"When
you
shall
have
an
opportunity,
ask
herself,"
was
the
quiet
answer.
Whether
he
reddened
or
paled
Caroline
did
not
examine.
She
discovered
that
it
was
late,
and
she
must
go
home.
Home
she
would
go;
not
even
Robert
could
detain
her
now.
The
future
sometimes
seems
to
sob
a
low
warning
of
the
events
it
is
bringing
us,
like
some
gathering
though
yet
remote
storm,
which,
in
tones
of
the
wind,
in
flushings
of
the
firmament,
in
clouds
strangely
torn,
announces
a
blast
strong
to
strew
the
sea
with
wrecks;
or
commissioned
to
bring
in
fog
the
yellow
taint
of
pestilence
covering
white
Western
isles
with
the
poisoned
exhalations
of
the
East,
dimming
the
lattices
of
English
homes
with
the
breath
of
Indian
plague.
At
other
times
this
future
bursts
suddenly,
as
if
a
rock
had
rent,
and
in
it
