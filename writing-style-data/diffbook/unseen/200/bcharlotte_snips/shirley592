bear
to
be
restrained."
"What
for?"
"To
speak
to
him,
to
ask
how
he
is,
and
what
I
can
do
for
him."
"To
tease
and
annoy
him;
to
make
a
spectacle
of
yourself
and
him
before
those
soldiers,
Mr.
Malone,
your
uncle,
et
cetera.
Would
he
like
it,
think
you?
Would
you
like
to
remember
it
a
week
hence?"
"Am
I
always
to
be
curbed
and
kept
down?"
demanded
Caroline,
a
little
passionately.
"For
his
sake,
yes;
and
still
more
for
your
own.
I
tell
you,
if
you
showed
yourself
now
you
would
repent
it
an
hour
hence,
and
so
would
Robert."
"You
think
he
would
not
like
it,
Shirley?"
"Far
less
than
he
would
like
our
stopping
him
to
say
good
night,
which
you
were
so
sore
about."
"But
that
was
all
play;
there
was
no
danger."
"And
this
is
serious
work;
he
must
be
unmolested."
"I
only
wish
to
go
to
him
because
he
is
my
cousin
you
understand?"
"I
quite
understand.
But
now,
watch
him.
He
has
bathed
his
forehead,
and
the
blood
has
ceased
trickling.
His
hurt
is
really
a
mere
graze;
I
can
see
it
from
hence.
He
is
going
to
look
after
the
wounded
