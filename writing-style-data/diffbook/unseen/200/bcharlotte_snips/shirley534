afar
her
isolation,
hastened
to
her
side.
"Let
us
go
to
the
top
of
the
fields,"
she
said.
"I
know
you
don't
like
crowds,
Caroline."
"But
it
will
be
depriving
you
of
a
pleasure,
Shirley,
to
take
you
from
all
these
fine
people,
who
court
your
society
so

I
call

"I
don't
wonder
that
your
scholars
like

"Nonsense,
