giving
yourself
too
much
trouble.
I
perceive
our
conjecture
was
correct.
We
are
not
a
regiment,
remember
only
about
half
a
dozen
soldiers
and
as
many
civilians.
Allow
me
to
retrench
something
from
these
too
abundant
supplies."
Miss
Keeldar
blushed,
while
she
laughed
at
her
own
over
eager
generosity
and

For

You

remarked
Moore,
levelling
another
