And
so
you
were
obstinate,
were
you?
I
should
like
to
see
you
obstinate,
I
should.
Wouldn't
I
have
you
in
good
discipline
if
I
owned
you?
Let
me
take
the
umbrella."
"I
can't
stay
two
minutes;
our
dinner
will
be
ready."
"And
so
will
ours;
and
we
have
always
a
hot
dinner
on
Sundays.

the
dyers,

my
mother
repenting

of
her
many
misdeeds
towards
me,
now
I
am
gone."
"Martin,
how
is
Mr.
Moore?"
"That
is
what
you
came
for,
just

say
that
word."
"Come,
