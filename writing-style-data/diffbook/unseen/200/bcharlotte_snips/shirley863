made
her
kind
hearted.
At
this
day
I
can
trust
both
her
integrity,
her
courage,
and
her
affection.
Call
her;
but
keep
my
good
aunt
and
my
timid
cousins
away.
Once
more,
promise."
"I
promise."
"That
is
good
in
you,"
she
said,
looking
up
at
him
as
he
bent
over
her,
and
smiling.
"Is
it
good?
Does
it
comfort?"
"Very
much."
"I
will
be
with

I

Mr.
Moore;
nor
am
I

But
when
I

I
fear
to
impart
it
to
those
I
love,
lest
it
should
pain
them;
and
to
those
whom
I
view
with
indifference
I
cannot
condescend
to
complain.
After
all,
you
should
not
taunt
me
with
being
childish,
for
if
you
were
as
unhappy
as
I
have
been
for
the
last
three
weeks,
you
too
would
want
some
friend."
"We
all
want
a
friend,
