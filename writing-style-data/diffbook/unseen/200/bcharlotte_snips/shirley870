said,
as
she
gathered
up
her
silks,
"have
you
heard
from
your
brother
lately?
Do
you
know
what
he
means
by
staying
in
town
so
long?
Does
he
talk
of
returning?"
"He
talks
of
returning;
but
what
has
caused
his
long
absence
I
cannot
tell.
To
speak
the
truth,
I
thought
none
in
Yorkshire
knew
better
than
yourself
why
he
was
reluctant
to
come
home."
A
crimson
shadow
passed
across
Miss
Keeldar's
cheek.
"Write
to
him
and
urge
him
to
come,"
she
said.
"I
know
there
has
been
no
impolicy
in
protracting
his
absence
thus
far.
It
is
good
to
let
the
mill
stand,
while
trade
is
so
bad;
but
he
must
not
abandon
the
county."
"I
am
aware,"
said
Louis,
"that
he
had
an
interview
with
you
the
evening
before
he
left,
and
I
saw
him
quit
Fieldhead
afterwards.
I
read
his
countenance,
or
tried
to
read
it.
He
turned
from
me.
I
divined
that
he
would
be
long
away.
Some
fine,
slight
fingers
have
a
wondrous
knack
at
pulverizing
a
man's
brittle
pride.
I
suppose
Robert
put
too
much
trust
in
his
manly
beauty
and
native
gentlemanhood.
Those
are
better
off
who,
being
destitute
of
advantage,
cannot
cherish
