He
puts
his
trust
in
a
snow
cloud;
the
wilderness,
the
wind,
and
the
hail
storm
are
his
refuge;
his
allies
are
the
elements
air,
fire,
water.
And
what
are
these?
Three
terrible
archangels
ever
stationed
before
the
throne
of
Jehovah.
They
stand
clothed
in
white,
girdled
with
golden
girdles;
they
uplift
vials,
brimming
with
the
wrath
of
God.
Their
time
is
the
day
of
vengeance;
their
signal,
the
word
of
the
Lord
of
hosts,
"thundering
with
the
voice
of
His
excellency."
"Hast
thou
entered
into
the
treasures
of
the
snow?
or
hast
thou
seen
the
treasures
of
the
hail,
which
I
have
reserved
against
the
time
of
trouble,
against
the
day
of
battle
and
war?
"Go
your
ways.
Pour
out
the
vials
of
the
wrath
of
God
upon
the
earth."
It
is
done.
The
earth
is
scorched
with
fire;
the
sea
becomes
"as
the
blood
of
a
dead
man;"
the
islands
flee
away;
the
mountains
are
not
found.
In
this
year,
Lord
Wellington
assumed
the
reins
in
Spain.
They
made
him
generalissimo,
for
their
own
salvation's
sake.
In
this
year
he
took
Badajos,
he
fought
the
field
of
Vittoria,
he
captured
Pampeluna,
he
stormed
San
Sebastian;
in
this
year
