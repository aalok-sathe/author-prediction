on
the
white
marble.
There
is
plenty
of
room
for
other
inscriptions
underneath."
"William
Farren
came
to
look
after
your
flowers
this
morning.
He
was
afraid,
now
you
cannot
tend
them
yourself,
they
would
be
neglected.
He
has
taken
two
of
your
favourite
plants
home
to
nurse
for
you."
"If
I
were
to
make
a
will,
I
would
leave
William
all
my
plants;
Shirley
my
trinkets
except
one,
which
must
not
be
taken
off
my
neck;
and
you,
ma'am,
my
books."
After
a
pause
"Mrs.
Pryor,
I
feel
a
longing
wish
for
something."
"For
what,
Caroline?"
"You
know
I
always
delight
to
hear
you
sing.
Sing
me
a
hymn
just
now.
Sing
that
hymn
which
begins,
'Our
God,
our
help
in
ages
past,
Our
hope
for
years
to
come,
Our
shelter
from
the
stormy
blast,
Our
refuge,
haven,
home!'"
Mrs.
Pryor
at
once
complied.
No
wonder
Caroline
liked
to
hear
her
sing.
Her
voice,
even
in
speaking,
was
sweet
and
silver
clear;
in
song
it
was
almost
divine.
Neither
flute
nor
dulcimer
has
tones
so
pure.
But
the
tone
was
secondary,
compared
to
the
expression
which
trembled
through
a
tender
vibration
from
a
feeling
heart.
The
servants
in
the
kitchen,
