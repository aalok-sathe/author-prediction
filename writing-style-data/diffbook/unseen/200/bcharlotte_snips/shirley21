right
mind,
do
you
think,
sir?"
inquired
Sweeting
simply.
"Can't
tell,
Davy.
He
may
be
crazed,
or
he
may
be
only
crafty,
or
perhaps
a
little
of
both."
"He
talks
of
seeing
visions,
sir."
"Ay!
He
is
a
very
Ezekiel
or
Daniel
for
visions.
He
came
just
when
I
was
going
to
bed
last
Friday
night
to
describe
one
that
had
been
revealed
to
him
in
Nunnely
Park
that
very
afternoon."
"Tell
it,
sir.
What
was
it?"
urged
Sweeting.
"Davy,
thou
hast
an
enormous
organ
of
wonder
in
thy
cranium.
Malone,
you
see,
has
none.
Neither
murders
nor
visions
interest
him.
See
what
a
big
vacant
Saph
he
looks
at
this
moment."
"Saph!
Who
was
Saph,
sir?"
"I
thought
you
would
not
know.
You
may
find
it
out.
It
is
biblical.
I
know
nothing
more
of
him
than
his
name
and
race;
but
from
a
boy
upwards
I
have
always
attached
a
personality
to
Saph.
Depend
on
it
he
was
honest,
heavy,
and
luckless.
He
met
his
end
at
Gob
by
the
hand
of
Sibbechai."
"But
the
vision,
sir?"
"Davy,
thou
shalt
hear.
Donne
is
biting
his
nails,
and
Malone
yawning,
so
I
will
tell
it
but
to
thee.
Mike
