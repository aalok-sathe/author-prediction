fairest
and
richest.
This
garden
is
none
of
ours,
but
we
enjoy
its
greenness
and
perfume,
don't
we?"
He
sat
silent,
still
caressing
Tartar,
who
slobbered
with
exceeding
affection.
A
faint
twittering
commenced
among
the
trees
round.
Something
fluttered
down
as
light
as
leaves.
They
were
little
birds,
which,
lighting
on
the
sward
at
shy
distance,
hopped
as
if
expectant.
"The
small
brown
elves
actually
remember

the

again
soliloquized
Louis.

never
destitute

something
available
to
throw
to
the
chickens,
young
ducks,
or
sparrows.
She
crumbled

and
bending
over
his
shoulder,
put
the
crumbs
into
his
hand.
"There,"
said
she

"This
September
afternoon
is

observed
Louis
Moore,
as,
not
at

discomposed,
he
calmly
cast
the
crumbs
on
to
the
grass.
"Even

"As
pleasant
