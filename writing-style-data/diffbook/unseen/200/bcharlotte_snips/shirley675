you
may
give
him
your
hand;
perhaps,
for
a
minute,
you
may
sit
beside
him."
"Silence!"
was
her
austere
response;
but
she
loved
the
comforter
and
the
consolation.
Miss
Moore
probably
caught
from
the
window
the
gleam
and
flutter
of
Caroline's
white
attire
through
the
branchy
garden
shrubs,
for
she
advanced
from
the
cottage
porch
to
meet
her.
Straight,
unbending,
phlegmatic
as
usual,
she
came
on.
No
haste
or
ecstasy
was
ever
permitted
to
disorder
the

share
of
this
childlike
joy
was
to
be
placed,
Hortense
would
most
likely
have
felt
both
shocked
and
incensed.
Sisters
do
not
like
young
ladies
to
fall
in
love
with
their
brothers.
It
seems,
if
not
presumptuous,
silly,
weak,
a
delusion,
an
absurd
mistake.
They
do
not
love
these
gentlemen

affection
