you."
"My
cousin
Robert
not
Mr.
Moore."
"Not
a
bit
of
Mr.
Moore.
Caroline
"
Here
the
company
was
heard
rising
in
the
other
room.
The
door
was
opened;
the
pony
carriage
was
ordered;
shawls
and
bonnets
were
demanded;
Mr.
Helstone
called
for
his
niece.
"I
must
go,
Robert."
"Yes,
you
must
go,
or
they
will
come
in
and
find
us
here;
and
I,
rather
than
meet
all
that
host
in
the
passage,
will
take
my
departure
through
the
window.
Luckily
it
opens
like
a
door.
One
minute
only
put
down
the
candle
an
instant
good
night.
I
kiss
you
because
we
are
cousins,
and,
being
cousins,
one
two
three
kisses
are
allowable.
Caroline,
good
night."
The
next
day
Moore
had
risen
before
the
sun,
and
had
taken
a
ride
to
Whinbury
and
back
ere
his
sister
had
made
the
cafe
au
lait
or
cut
the
tartines
for
his
breakfast.
What
business
he
transacted
there
he
kept
to
himself.
Hortense
asked
no
questions:
it
was
not
her
wont
to
comment
on
his
movements,
nor
his
to
render
an
account
of
them.
The
secrets
of
business
complicated
and
often
dismal
mysteries
were
buried
in
his
breast,
and
never
came
out
of
