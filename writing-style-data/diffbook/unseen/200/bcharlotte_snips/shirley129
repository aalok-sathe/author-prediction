go
back
to
the
cottage,
and
then,
while
she
completed
the
exercise,
or
worked
out
the
sum
(for
Mdlle.
Moore
taught
her
arithmetic
too),
she
would
wish
nature
had
made
her
a
boy
instead
of
a
girl,
that
she
might
ask
Robert
to
let
her
be
his
clerk,
and
sit
with
him
in
the
counting
house,
instead
of
sitting
with
Hortense
in
the
parlour.
Occasionally
but
this
happened
very
rarely
she
spent
the
evening
at
Hollow's
Cottage.
Sometimes
during
these
visits
Moore
was
away
attending
a
market;
sometimes
he
was
gone
to
Mr.
Yorke's;
often
he
was
engaged
with
a
male
visitor
in
another
room;
but
sometimes,
too,
he
was
at
home,
disengaged,
free
to
talk
with
Caroline.
When
this
was
the
case,
the
evening
hours
passed
on
wings
of
light;
they
were
gone
before
they
were
counted.
There
was
no
room
in
England
so
pleasant
as
that
small
parlour
when
the
three
cousins
occupied
it.
Hortense,
when
she
was
not
teaching,
or
scolding,
or
cooking,
was
far
from
ill
humoured;
it
was
her
custom
to
relax
towards
evening,
and
to
be
kind
to
her
young
English
kinswoman.
There
was
a
means,
too,
of
rendering
her
delightful,
by
inducing
