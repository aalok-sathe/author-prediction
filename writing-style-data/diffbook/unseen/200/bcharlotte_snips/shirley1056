his
wits,
he
declared
he
would
not.
Repeating
the
former
order,
I
added
a
commission
to
fetch
a
constable.
I
said,
'You
shall
go,
by
fair
means
or
foul.'
"He
threatened
prosecution;
I
cared
for
nothing.
I
had
stood
over
him
once
before,
not
quite
so
fiercely
as
now,
but
full
as
austerely.
It
was
one
night
when
burglars
attempted
the
house
at
Sympson
Grove,
and
in
his
wretched
cowardice
he
would
have
given
a

alarm,
without

not
how.
He
called
for
his
wife
and
daughters
to
come.
I
said
they
should
follow
him
as
soon
as
they
could
prepare.
The
smoke,
the
fume,
the
fret
of
his
demeanour
was
inexpressible,
but
it
was
a
fury
incapable
of
producing
a
deed.
That
man,
properly
handled,
must
ever
remain
impotent.
I
know
he
will
never
touch
me
with
the
law.
I
know
