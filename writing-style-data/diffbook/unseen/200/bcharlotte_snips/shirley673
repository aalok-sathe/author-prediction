no
enchantress,
and
knew
no
magic
spell;
yet
what
she
said
took
almost
magical
effect
on
her
young
mistress.
She
lifted
her
head
with
the
quick
motion
of
revived
sensation;
she
shot,
not
a
languid,
but
a
lifelike,
questioning
glance
at
Fanny.
"Harry
Scott!
who
sent
him?"
"He
came
from
the
Hollow."
The
dropped
note
was
snatched
up
eagerly,
the
seal
was
broken
it
was
read
in
two
seconds.
An
affectionate
billet
from
Hortense,
informing
her
young
cousin
that
she
was
returned
from
Wormwood
Wells;
that
she
was
alone
to
day,
as
Robert
was
gone
to
Whinbury
market;
that
nothing
would
give
her
greater
pleasure
than
to
have
Caroline's
company
to
tea,
and
the
good
lady
added,
she
was
quite
sure
such
a
change
would
be
most
acceptable
and
beneficial
to
Caroline,
who
must
be
sadly
at
a
loss
both
for
safe
guidance
and
improving
society
since
the
misunderstanding
between
Robert
and
Mr.
Helstone
had
occasioned
a
separation
from
her
"meilleure
amie,
Hortense
Gerard
Moore."
In
a
postscript
she
was
urged
to
put
on
her
bonnet
and
run
down
directly.
Caroline
did
not
need
the
injunction.
Glad
was
she
to
lay
by
the
brown
holland
child's
slip
she
was
trimming
