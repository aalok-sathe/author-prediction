will
do
you
good."
"She
is
now
come
of
age,
I
suppose?"
"She
is
come
of
age,
and
will
reside
for
a
time
on
her
property.
I
lectured
her
on
the
subject;
I
showed
her
her
duty.
She
is
not
intractable.
She
is
rather
a
fine
girl;
she
will
teach
you
what
it
is
to
have
a
sprightly
spirit.
Nothing
lackadaisical
about
her."
"I
don't
think
she
will
want
to
see
me,
or
to
have
me
introduced
to
her.
What
good
can
I
do
her?
How
can
I
amuse
her?"
"Pshaw!
Put
your
bonnet
on."
"Is
she
proud,
uncle?"
"Don't
know.
You
hardly
imagine
she
would
show
her
pride
to
me,
I
suppose?
A
chit
like
that
would
scarcely
presume
to
give
herself
airs
with
the
rector
of
her
parish,
however
rich
she
might
be."
"No.
But
how
did
she
behave
to
other
people?"
"Didn't
observe.
She
holds
her
head
high,
and
probably
can
be
saucy
enough
where
she
dare.
She
wouldn't
be
a
woman
otherwise.
There!
Away
now
for
your
bonnet
at
once!"
Not
naturally
very
confident,
a
failure
of
physical
strength
and
a
depression
of
spirits
had
not
tended
to
increase
Caroline's
