heart.
I
know
I
speak
in
an
unknown
tongue;
but
I
feel
indifferent
whether
I
am
comprehended
or
not."
"And
if
this
love
of
yours
should
fall
on
a
beggar?"
"On
a
beggar
it
will
never
fall.
Mendicancy
is
not
estimable."
"On
a
low
clerk,
a
play
actor,
a
play
writer,
or
or
"
"Take
courage,
Mr.
Sympson!
Or
what?"
"Any
literary
scrub,
or
shabby,
whining
artist."
"For
the
scrubby,
shabby,
whining
I
have
no
taste;
for
literature
and
the
arts
I
have.
And
there
I
wonder
how
your
Fawthrop
Wynne
would
suit
me.
He
cannot
write
a
note
without
orthographical
errors;
he
reads
only
a
sporting
paper;
he
was
the
booby
of
Stilbro'
grammar
school!"
"Unladylike
language!
Great
God!
to
what
will
she
come?"
He
lifted
hands
and
eyes.
"Never
to
the
altar
of
Hymen
with
Sam
Wynne."
"To
what
will
she
come?
Why
are
not
the
laws
more
stringent,
that
I
might
compel
her
to
hear
reason?"
"Console
yourself,
uncle.
Were
Britain
a
serfdom
and
you
the
Czar,
you
could
not
compel
me
to
this
step.
I
will
write
to
Mr.
Wynne.
Give
yourself
no
further
trouble
on
the
subject."
