way
through.
The
long
hair,
the
tender
skin,
the
silks
and
the
muslins
suffered;
but
what
was
chiefly
regretted
was
the
impediment
this
difficulty
had
caused
to
speed.
On
the
other
side
they
met
the
beck,
flowing
deep
in
a
rough
bed.
At
this
point
a
narrow
plank
formed
the
only
bridge
across
it.
Shirley
had
trodden
the
plank
successfully
and
fearlessly
many
a
time
before;
Caroline
had
never
yet
dared
to
risk
the
transit.
"I
will
carry
you
across,"
said
Miss
Keeldar.
"You
are
light,
and
I
am
not
weak.
Let
me
try."
"If
I
fall
in,
you
may
fish
me
out,"
was
the
answer,
as
a
grateful
squeeze
compressed
her
hand.
Caroline,
without
pausing,
trod
forward
on
the
trembling
plank
as
if
it
were
a
continuation
of
the
firm
turf.
Shirley,
who
followed,
did
not
cross
it
more
resolutely
or
safely.
In
their
present
humour,
on
their
present
errand,
a
strong
and
foaming
channel
would
have
been
a
barrier
to
neither.
At
the
moment
they
were
above
the
control
either
of
fire
or
water.
All
Stilbro'
Moor,
alight
and
aglow
with
bonfires,
would
not
have
stopped
them,
nor
would
Calder
or
Aire
thundering
in
flood.
Yet
one
sound
