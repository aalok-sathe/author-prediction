her.
One
living
thing
alone,
besides
his
pale,
crippled
scholar,
he
fondled
in
the
house,
and
that
was
the
ruffianly
Tartar,
who,
sullen
and
impracticable
to
others,
acquired
a
singular
partiality
for
him
a
partiality
so
marked
that
sometimes,
when
Moore,
summoned
to
a
meal,
entered
the
room
and
sat
down
unwelcomed,
Tartar
would
rise
from
his
lair
at
Shirley's
feet
and
betake
himself
to
the
taciturn
tutor.
Once
but
once
she
noticed
the
desertion,
and
holding
out
her
white
hand,
and
speaking
softly,
tried
to
coax
him
back.
Tartar
looked,
slavered,
and
sighed,
as
his
manner
was,
but
yet
disregarded
the
invitation,
and
coolly
settled
himself
on
his
haunches
at
Louis
Moore's
side.
That
gentleman
drew
the
dog's
big,
black
muzzled
head
on
to
his
knee,
patted
him,
and
smiled
one
little
smile
to
himself.
An
acute
observer
might
have
remarked,
in
the
course
of
the
same
evening,
that
after
Tartar
had
resumed
his
allegiance
to
Shirley,
and
was
once
more
couched
near
her
footstool,
the
audacious
tutor
by
one
word
and
gesture
fascinated
him
again.
He
pricked
up
his
ears
at
the
word;
he
started
erect
at
the
gesture,
and
came,
with
head
lovingly
depressed,
to
receive
the
