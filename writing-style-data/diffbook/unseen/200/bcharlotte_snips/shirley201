music
was
asked
for.
This
was
Mr.
Sweeting's
chance
for
showing
off.
He
was
eager
to
commence.
He
undertook,
therefore,
the
arduous
task
of
persuading
the
young
ladies
to
favour
the
company
with
an
air
a
song.
Con
amore
he
went
through
the
whole
business
of
begging,
praying,
resisting
excuses,
explaining
away
difficulties,
and
at
last
succeeded
in
persuading
Miss
Harriet
to
allow
herself
to
be
led
to
the

Then
out

They
could
not
accompany
the
ladies
as
he
could;
he
was
about
to
enjoy
a
triumph
over
them.
The
triumph
began.
Malone,
much
chagrined
at
hearing
him
pipe
up
in
most
superior
style,
determined
to
earn
distinction
too,
if
possible,
and
all
at
once

the
character
of
a
swain
