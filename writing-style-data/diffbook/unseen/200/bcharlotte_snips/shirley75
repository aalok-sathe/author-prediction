he
professed
some
excellent
general
doctrines
of
mutual
toleration
and
forbearance,
he
cherished
towards
certain
classes
a
bigoted
antipathy.
He
spoke
of
"parsons"
and
all
who
belonged
to
parsons,
of
"lords"
and
the
appendages
of
lords,
with
a
harshness,
sometimes
an
insolence,
as
unjust
as
it
was
insufferable.
He
could
not
place
himself
in
the
position
of
those
he
vituperated;
he
could
not
compare
their
errors
with
their
temptations,
their
defects
with
their
disadvantages;
he
could
not
realize
the
effect
of
such
and

on
himself
similarly

and
he
would

who
had
acted,
as
he
thought,
ferociously
and
tyrannically.
To
judge
by
his
threats,
he
would
have
employed
arbitrary,
even
cruel,
means
to
advance
the
cause
of
freedom
and
equality.
Equality!
yes,
Mr.
Yorke
talked
about
equality,
but
at
heart
he
was
a
proud
man
very
friendly
to
his
workpeople,
very
good
to
all
who
were
beneath
him,
and
submitted
quietly
to
be
beneath
him,
but
haughty
as
Beelzebub
to
whomsoever
the
world
deemed
(for
he
deemed
no
man)
his
superior.
Revolt
was
in
his
blood:
he
could
not
bear
control;
his
father,
his
grandfather
before
him,
could
