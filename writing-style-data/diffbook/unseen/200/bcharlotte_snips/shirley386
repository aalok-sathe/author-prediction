me."
"Caroline,"
demanded
Miss
Keeldar
abruptly,
"don't
you
wish
you
had
a
profession
a
trade?"
"I
wish
it
fifty
times
a
day.
As
it
is,
I
often
wonder
what
I
came
into
the
world
for.
I
long
to
have
something
absorbing
and
compulsory
to
fill
my
head
and
hands
and
to
occupy
my
thoughts."
"Can
labour
alone
make
a
human
being
happy?"
"No;
but
it
can
give
varieties
of
pain,
and
prevent
us
from
breaking
our
hearts
with
a

torture.
Besides,
successful
labour
has
its
recompense;
a

are
unattractive
and
inelegant
or
not?
Provided
only
they
are
decent,
decorous,
and
neat,
it
is
enough.
The
utmost
which
ought
to
be
required
of
old
maids,
in
the
way
of
appearance,
is
that
they
should
not
absolutely
offend
men's
eyes
as
they
pass
them
in
the
street;
for
the
rest,
they
should
be
allowed,
without
too
much
scorn,
to
be
as
absorbed,
grave,
plain
looking,
and
plain
dressed
as
they
please."
"You
might
