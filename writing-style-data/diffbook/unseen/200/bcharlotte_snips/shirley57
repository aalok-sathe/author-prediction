and
the
fact
is,
being
both
men
of
steely
nerves
and
steady
beating
hearts,
were
elate
with
the
knowledge.
I
am
aware,
reader,
and
you
need
not
remind
me,
that
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
for
a
parson
to
be
warlike;
I
am
aware
that
he
should
be
a
man
of
peace.
I
have
some
faint
outline
of
an
idea
of
what
a
clergyman's
mission
is
amongst
mankind,
and
I
remember
distinctly
whose
servant
he
is,
whose
message
he
delivers,
whose
example
he
should
follow;
yet,
with
all
this,
if
you
are
a
parson
hater,
you
need
not
expect
me
to
go
along
with
you
every
step
of
your
dismal,
downward
tending,
unchristian
road;
you
need
not
expect
me
to
join
in
your
deep
anathemas,
at
once
so
narrow
and
so
sweeping,
in
your
poisonous
rancour,
so
intense
and
so
absurd,
against
"the
cloth;"
to
lift
up
my
eyes
and
hands
with
a
Supplehough,
or
to
inflate
my
lungs
with
a
Barraclough,
in
horror
and
denunciation
of
the
diabolical
rector
of
Briarfield.
He
was
not
diabolical
at
all.
The
evil
simply
was
he
had
missed
his
vocation.
He
should
have
been
a
soldier,
and
circumstances
had
made
him
a
priest.
