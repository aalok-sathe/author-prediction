course,
must
be
paramount,
and
they
might
be
trusted.
They
had
some
experience,
some
sagacity,
and
Mr.
Hall,
at
least,
had
sympathy
and
loving
kindness
for
his
fellow
men;
but
as
for
the
youth
under
them,
they
must
be
set
aside,
kept
down,
and
taught
that
subordination
and
silence
best
became
their
years
and
capacity.
It
was
with
some
horror
Miss
Ainley
heard
this
language.
Caroline,
however,
interposing
with
a
mild
word
or
two
in
praise
of
Mr
Sweeting,
calmed
her
again.
Sweeting
was,
indeed,
her
own
favourite.
She
endeavoured
to
respect
Messrs.
Malone
and
Donne,
but
the
slices
of
sponge
cake
and
glasses
of
cowslip
or
primrose
wine
she
had
at
different
times
administered
to
Sweeting,
when
he
came
to
see
her
in
her
little
cottage,
were
ever
offered
with
sentiments
of
truly
motherly
regard.
The
same
innocuous
collation
she
had
once
presented
to
Malone;
but
that
personage
evinced
such
open
scorn
of
the
offering,
she
had
never
ventured
to
renew
it.
To
Donne
she
always
served
the
treat,
and
was
happy
to
see
his
approbation
of
it
proved
beyond
a
doubt
by
the
fact
of
his
usually
eating
two
pieces
of
cake,
and
putting
a
third
in
his
