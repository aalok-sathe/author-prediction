Sam
Wynne,
are
in
the
drawing
room."
And
he
bowed
and
withdrew.
"The
family
from
De
Walden
Hall!
Couldn't
be
a
worse
set,"
murmured
Shirley.
She
sat
still,
looking
a
little
contumacious,
and
very
much
indisposed
to
stir.
She
was
flushed
with
the
fire.
Her
dark
hair
had
been
more
than
once
dishevelled
by
the
morning
wind
that
day.
Her
attire
was
a
light,
neatly
fitting,
but
amply
flowing
dress
of
muslin;
the
shawl
she
had
worn
in
the
garden
was
still
draped
in
a
careless
fold
round
her.
Indolent,
wilful,
picturesque,
and
singularly
pretty
was
her
aspect
prettier
than
usual,
as
if
some
soft
inward
emotion,
stirred
who
knows
how,
had
given
new
bloom
and
expression
to
her
features.
"Shirley,
Shirley,
you
ought
to
go,"
whispered
Caroline.
"I
wonder
why?"
She
lifted
her
eyes,
and
saw
in
the
glass
over
the
fireplace
both
Mr.
Hall
and
Louis
Moore
gazing
at
her
gravely.
"If,"
she
said,
with
a
yielding
smile
"if
a
majority
of
the
present
company
maintain
that
the
De
Walden
Hall
people
have
claims
on
my
civility,
I
will
subdue
my
inclinations
to
my
duty.
Let
those
who
think
I
ought
to
go
hold
up
their
hands."
