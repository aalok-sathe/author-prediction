or

and
taken
in
bodies,
they
are
intensely
so.
The
British
merchant
is
no
exception
to
this
rule:
the
mercantile
classes
illustrate
it
strikingly.
These
classes
certainly
think
too
exclusively
of
making
money;
they
are
too
oblivious
of
every
national
consideration
but
that
of
extending
England's
that
is,
their
own
commerce.
Chivalrous
feeling,
disinterestedness,
pride
in
honour,
is
too
dead
in
their
hearts.
A
land
ruled
by
them
alone
would
too
often
make
ignominious
submission
not
at
all
from
the
motives
Christ
teaches,
but
rather

the
tradesmen

England

endured
buffets
from
the
French
on

given
to
Napoleon,
and
then
have
politely
offered
him
their
coat

nor
would
they
have
withheld
their
waistcoat
if
urged;
they
would
have
prayed
permission
only
to
retain
their
one
other
garment,
for
the
sake
of
the
purse
in
its
pocket.
Not
one
spark
of
spirit,
not
one
symptom
of
resistance,
would
they
have
shown
till
the
hand
of
the
Corsican
bandit
had
grasped
that
beloved
purse;
then,
perhaps,
transfigured
at
once
into
British
bulldogs,
they
would
