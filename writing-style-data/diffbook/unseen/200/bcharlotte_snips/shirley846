ever
complain
to
your
mother
or
sisters?"
"Never.
She
laughs
at
them
when
they
question
her.
Mr.
Moore,
she
is
a
strange
being,
so
fair
and
girlish
not
a
man
like
woman
at
all,
not
an
Amazon,
and
yet
lifting
her
head
above
both
help
and
sympathy."
"Do
you
know
where
she
is
now,
Henry?
Is
she
in
the
house,
or
riding
out?"
"Surely
not
out,
sir.
It
rains
fast."
"True;
which,
however,
is
no
guarantee
that
she
is
not
at
this
moment
cantering
over
Rushedge.
Of
late
she
has
never
permitted
weather
to
be
a
hindrance
to
her
rides."
"You
remember,
Mr.
Moore,
how
wet
and
stormy
it
was
last
Wednesday
so
wild,
indeed,
that
she
would
not
permit
Zoe
to
be
saddled?
Yet
the
blast
she
thought
too
tempestuous
for
her
mare
she
herself
faced
on
foot;
that
afternoon
she
walked
nearly
as
far
as
Nunnely.
I
asked
her,
when
she
came
in,
if
she
was
not
afraid
of
taking
cold.
'Not
I,'
she
said.
'It
would
be
too
much
good
luck
for
me.
I
don't
know,
Harry,
but
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
me
would
be
to
take
a
good
cold
and
fever,
and
so
