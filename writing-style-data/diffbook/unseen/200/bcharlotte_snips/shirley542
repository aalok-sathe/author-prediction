undemonstrative,"
remarked
Miss
Keeldar.
"Why
did
you
not
give
Moore
your
hand
when
he
offered
you
his?
He
is
your
cousin;
you
like
him.
Are
you
ashamed
to
let
him
perceive
your
affection?"
"He
perceives
all
of
it
that
interests
him.
No
need
to
make
a
display
of
feeling."
"You
are
laconic;
you
would
be
stoical
if
you
could.
Is
love,
in
your
eyes,
a
crime,
Caroline?"
"Love
a
crime!
No,
Shirley;
love
is
a
divine
virtue.
But
why
drag
that
word
into
the
conversation?
It
is
singularly
irrelevant."
"Good!"
pronounced
Shirley.
The
two
girls
paced
the
green
lane
in
silence.
Caroline
first
resumed.
"Obtrusiveness
is
a
crime,
forwardness
is
a
crime,
and
both
disgust;
but
love!
no
purest
angel
need
blush
to
love.
And
when
I
see
or
hear
either
man
or
woman
couple
shame
with
love,
I
know
their
minds
are
coarse,
their
associations
debased.
Many
who
think
themselves
refined
ladies
and
gentlemen,
and
on
whose
lips
the
word
'vulgarity'
is
for
ever
hovering,
cannot
mention
'love'
without
betraying
their
own
innate
and
imbecile
degradation.
It
is
a
low
feeling
in
their
estimation,
connected
only
with
low
ideas
for
them."
"You
describe
three
fourths
of
the
world,
Caroline."
