yard
with
their
gleaming
lights,
when
the
tramp
of
horses
was
heard,
and
a
little
man
in
a
shovel
hat,
sitting
erect
on
the
back
of
a
shaggy
pony,
"rode
lightly
in,"
followed
by
an
aide
de
camp
mounted
on
a
larger
steed.
Mr.
Moore,
meantime,
after
stabling
his
dray
horses,
had
saddled
his
hackney,
and
with
the
aid
of
Sarah,
the
servant,
lit
up
his
mill,
whose
wide
and
long
front
now
glared
one
great
illumination,
throwing
a
sufficient
light
on
the
yard
to
obviate
all
fear
of
confusion
arising
from
obscurity.
Already
a
deep
hum
of
voices
became
audible.
Mr.
Malone
had
at
length
issued
from
the
counting
house,
previously
taking
the
precaution
to
dip
his
head
and
face
in
the
stone
water
jug;
and
this
precaution,
together
with
the
sudden
alarm,
had
nearly
restored
to
him
the
possession
of
those
senses
which
the
punch
had
partially
scattered.
He
stood
with
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head,
and
his
shillelah
grasped
in
his
dexter
fist,
answering
much
at
random
the
questions
of
the
newly
arrived
party
from
the
Redhouse.
Mr.
Moore
now
appeared,
and
was
immediately
confronted
by
the
shovel
hat
and
the
shaggy
pony.
"Well,
