trembled
when
their
hearts
were
so
stirred;
mine
went
to
work
steadily,
and
my
voice,
when
I
called
it
into
exercise,
was
firm.
"'This
day
week
you
will
be
alone
at
Fieldhead,
Miss
Keeldar.'
"'Yes:
I
rather
think
my
uncle's
intention
to
go
is
a
settled
one
now.'
"'He
leaves
you
dissatisfied.'
"'He
is
not
pleased
with
me.'
"'He
departs
as
he
came
no
better
for
his
journey.
This
is
mortifying.'
"'I
trust
the
failure
of
his
plans
will
take
from
him
all
inclination
to
lay
new
ones.'
"'In
his
way
Mr.
Sympson
honestly
wished
you
well.
All
he
has
done
or
intended
to
do
he
believed
to
be
for
the
best.'
"'You
are
kind
to
undertake
the
defence
of
a
man
who
has
permitted
himself
to
treat
you
with
so
much
insolence.'
"'I
never
feel
shocked
at,
or
bear
malice
for,
what
is
spoken
in
character;
and
most
perfectly
in
character
was
that
vulgar
and
violent
onset
against
me,
when
he
had
quitted
you
worsted.'
"'You
cease
now
to
be
Henry's
tutor?'
"'I
shall
be
parted
from
Henry
for
a
while
(if
he
and
I
live
we
shall
meet
again
somehow,
for
we
love
each
other)
and
be
ousted
