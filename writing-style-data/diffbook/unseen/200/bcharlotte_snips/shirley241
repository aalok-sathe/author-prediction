begin
selling
stuff."
"Could
you,
William?"
"Please
God,"
returned
William
deliberately,
"I
could
buy
groceries,
and
bits
o'
tapes,
and
thread,
and
what
I
thought
would
sell,
and
I
could
begin
hawking
at
first."
"And
you
know,
sir,"
interposed
Grace,
"you're
sure
William
would
neither
drink,
nor
idle,
nor
waste,
in
any
way.
He's
my
husband,
and
I
shouldn't
praise
him;
but
I
will
say
there's
not
a
soberer,

man

is."
"Well,
I'll
speak

I'm
quite

to
that."
"Meantime,
there's
a
few
shillings
for
you,
Grace,
just
to
keep
the
pot
boiling
till
custom
comes.
Now,
bairns,
stand
up
in
a
row
and
say
your
catechism,
while
your
mother
goes
and
buys
some
dinner;
for
you've
not
had
much
to
day,
I'll
be
bound.
You
begin,
Ben.
What
is
your
name?"
Mr.
Hall
stayed
till
Grace
came
back;
then
he
hastily
took
his
leave,
shaking
hands
with
both
Farren
and
his
wife.
Just
at
the
door
