eyes
and
carriage
of
some
Miss
Keeldar,
for
instance
these
sounds
awoke,
if
not
a
martial,
yet
a
longing
spirit.
Old
Helstone,
turning
by
chance,
looked
into
her
face;
and
he
laughed,
and
she
laughed
at
him.
"There
is
no
battle
in
prospect,"
he
said;
"our
country
does
not
want
us
to
fight
for
it.
No
foe
or
tyrant
is
questioning
or
threatening
our
liberty.
There

We
are
only
taking
a

your
hand
on
the

slack
the
fire
of
that
spirit.
It
is
not
wanted,
the
more's
the
pity."

desire
or
if
we
are,
we
are
soldiers
of
the
Cross.
Time
has
rolled
back
some
hundreds
of
years,
and
we
are
bound
on
a
pilgrimage
to
Palestine.
But
no;
that
is
too
visionary.
I
need
a
sterner
dream.
We
are
Lowlanders
of
Scotland,
following
a
Covenanting
captain
up
into
the
hills
to
hold
a
meeting
out
of
the
reach
of
persecuting
troopers.
We
know
that
battle
may
follow
prayer;
and
