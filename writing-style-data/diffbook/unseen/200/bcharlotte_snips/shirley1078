to
be
forgiven
as
she
forgives
will
she
pardon
all
I
have
made
her
suffer,
all
that
long
pain
I
have
wickedly
caused
her,
all
that
sickness
of
body
and
mind
she
owed
to
me?
Will
she
forget
what
she
knows
of
my
poor
ambition,
my
sordid
schemes?
Will
she
let
me
expiate
these
things?
Will
she
suffer
me
to
prove
that,
as
I
once

cruelly,
trifled
wantonly,
injured
basely,
I
can
now
love
faithfully,
cherish
fondly,
treasure

him.
"Is

life.
Not
more
jealous

"I
love
you,
too,
Robert,
and
will
take
faithful
care
of
you."
"Will
you
take
faithful
care
of
me?
Faithful
care!
As
if
that
rose
should
promise
to
shelter
from
tempest
this
hard
gray
stone!
But
she
will
care
for
me,
in
her
way.
These
hands
will
be
the
gentle
ministrants
of
every
comfort
I
can
taste.
