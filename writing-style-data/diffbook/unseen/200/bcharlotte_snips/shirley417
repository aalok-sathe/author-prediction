foreign
habits
are
leaving
me
one
by
one."
And
now
he
paid
his
respects
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
and
paid
them
well,
with
a
grave
modesty
that
became
his
age
compared
with
hers.
Then
he
looked
at
Caroline
not,
however,
for
the
first
time:
his
glance
had
fallen
upon
her
before.
He
bent
towards
her
as
she
sat,
gave
her
his
hand,
and
asked

how
she
was.
The
light

the
window
did
not
fall

never
interchanged.
Moore
took
the
empty
chair
near
her,
opposite
Miss
Keeldar.
He
had
placed
himself
well.
His
neighbour,
screened
by
the
very
closeness
of
his
vicinage
from
his
scrutiny,
and
sheltered

by
the
dusk
which
deepened
each
moment,
soon
regained
not
merely
seeming
but
