superior
to
her
present
self,
so
as
to
feel
less
scared
by
their
dignity.
The
sole
means
she
found
of
reviving
the
flagging
discourse
was
by
asking
them
if
they
would
all
stay
to
tea;
and
a
cruel
struggle
it
cost
her
to
perform
this
piece
of
civility.
Mrs.
Sykes
had
begun,
"We
are
much
obliged
to
you,
but
"
when
in
came
Fanny
once
more.
"The
gentlemen
will
stay
the
evening,
ma'am,"
was
the
message
she
brought
from
Mr.
Helstone.
"What
gentlemen
have
you?"
now
inquired
Mrs.
Sykes.
Their
names
were
specified;
she
and
her
daughters
interchanged
glances.
The
curates
were
not
to
them
what
they
were
to
Caroline.
Mr.
Sweeting
was
quite
a
favourite
with
them;
even
Mr.
Malone
rather
so,
because
he
was
a
clergyman.
"Really,
since
you
have
company
already,
I
think
we
will
stay,"
remarked
Mrs.
Sykes.
"We
shall
be
quite
a
pleasant
little
party.
I
always
like
to
meet
the
clergy."
And
now
Caroline
had
to
usher
them
upstairs,
to
help
them
to
unshawl,
smooth
their
hair,
and
make
themselves
smart;
to
reconduct
them
to
the
drawing
room,
to
distribute
amongst
them
books
of
engravings,
or
odd
things
purchased
from
the
Jew
basket.
