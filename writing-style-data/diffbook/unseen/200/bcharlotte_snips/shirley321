sort
of
tacit
antipathy;
an
old
servant,
who
had
lived
with
Mrs.
James
Helstone
for
a
short
time
after
her
marriage,
whenever
she
referred
to
her
former
mistress,
spoke
with
chilling
reserve
sometimes
she
called
her
"queer,"
sometimes
she
said
she
did
not
understand
her.
These
expressions
were
ice
to
the
daughter's
heart;
they
suggested
the
conclusion
that
it
was
perhaps
better
never
to
know
her
parent
than
to
know
her
and
not
like
her.
But
one
project
could
she
frame
whose
execution
seemed
likely
to
bring
her
a
hope
of
relief:
it
was
to
take
a
situation,
to
be
a
governess;
she
could
do
nothing
else.
A
little
incident
brought
her
to
the
point,
when
she
found
courage
to
break
her
design
to
her
uncle.
Her
long
and
late
walks
lay
always,
as
has
been
said,
on
lonely
roads;
but
in
whatever
direction
she
had
rambled
whether
along
the
drear
skirts
of
Stilbro'
Moor
or
over
the
sunny
stretch
of
Nunnely
Common
her
homeward
path
was
still
so
contrived
as
to
lead
her
near
the
Hollow.
She
rarely
descended
the
den,
but
she
visited
its
brink
at
twilight
almost
as
regularly
as
the
stars
rose
over
the
hillcrests.
