conference,
of
which
no
word
was
distinguishable
from
the
dining
room.
"We
must
hear
this,"
said
Shirley.
She
turned,
took
her
pistols
from
the
table,
silently
passed
out
through
the
middle
window
of
the
dining
room,
which
was,
in
fact,
a
glass
door,
stole
down
the
walk
to
the
garden
wall,
and
stood
listening
under
the
lilacs.
Caroline
would
not
have
quitted
the
house
had
she
been
alone,
but
where
Shirley
went
she
would
go.
She
glanced
at
the
weapon
on
the
sideboard,
but
left
it
behind
her,
and
presently
stood
at
her
friend's
side.
They
dared
not
look
over
the
wall,
for
fear
of
being
seen;
they
were
obliged
to
crouch
behind
it.
They
heard
these
words,
"It
looks
a
rambling
old
building.
Who
lives
in
it
besides
the
damned
parson?"
"Only
three
women
his
niece
and
two
servants."
"Do
you
know
where
they
sleep?"
"The
lasses
behind;
the
niece
in
a
front
room."
"And
Helstone?"
"Yonder
is
his
chamber.
He
was
burning
a
light,
but
I
see
none
now."
"Where
would
you
get
in?"
"If
I
were
ordered
to
do
his
job
and
he
desarves
it
I'd
try
yond'
long
window;
it
opens
to
the
dining
room.
