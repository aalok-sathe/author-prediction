dangerous
waters,
sweeter
flowers,
more
tempting
fruits,
wider
plains,
drearier
deserts,
sunnier
fields
than
are
found
in
nature,
overspread
our
enchanted
globe.
What
a
moon
we
gaze
on
before
that
time!
How
the
trembling
of
our
hearts
at
her
aspect
bears
witness
to
its
unutterable
beauty!
As
to
our
sun,
it
is
a
burning
heaven
the
world
of
gods.
At
that
time,
at
eighteen,
drawing
near
the
confines
of
illusive,
void
dreams,
Elf
land
lies
behind
us,
the
shores
of
Reality
rise
in
front.
These
shores
are
yet
distant;
they
look
so
blue,
soft,
gentle,
we
long
to
reach
them.
In
sunshine
we
see
a
greenness
beneath
the
azure,
as
of
spring
meadows;
we
catch
glimpses
of
silver
lines,
and
imagine
the
roll
of
living
waters.
Could
we
but
reach
this
land,
we
think
to
hunger
and
thirst
no
more;
whereas
many
a
wilderness,
and
often
the
flood
of
death,
or
some
stream
of
sorrow
as
cold
and
almost
as
black
as
death,
is
to
be
crossed
ere
true
bliss
can
be
tasted.
Every
joy
that
life
gives
must
be
earned
ere
it
is
secured;
and
how
hardly
earned,
those
only
know
who
have
wrestled
for
great
prizes.
