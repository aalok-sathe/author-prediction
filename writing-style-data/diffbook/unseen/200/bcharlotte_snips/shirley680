said
Rose,
speaking
from
a
corner
where
she
was
sitting
on
the
carpet
at
the
foot
of
a
bookcase,
with
a
volume
spread
open
on
her
knee.
"Miss
Helstone,
how
do
you
do?"
she
added,
directing
a
brief
glance
to
the
person
addressed,
and
then
again
casting
down
her
gray,
remarkable
eyes
on
the
book
and
returning
to
the
study
of
its
pages.
Caroline
stole
a
quiet

book.
It
was
a
romance
of
Mrs.
Radcliffe's
"The
Italian."
Caroline
read
on
with
her,
making
no
remark.
Presently
Rose
showed
her
the
attention
of
asking,
ere
she
turned
the
leaf,
"Are

Caroline
only
nodded.
"Do

inquired
Rose
ere

"Why?"
