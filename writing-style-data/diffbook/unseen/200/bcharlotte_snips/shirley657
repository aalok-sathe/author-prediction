her
needle
scarce
threaded,
when
a
sudden
thought
calls
her
upstairs.
Perhaps
she
goes
to
seek
some
just
then
remembered
old
ivory
backed
needle
book
or
older
china
topped
work
box,
quite
unneeded,
but
which
seems
at
the
moment
indispensable;
perhaps
to
arrange
her
hair,
or
a
drawer
which
she
recollects
to
have
seen
that
morning
in
a
state
of
curious
confusion;
perhaps
only
to
take
a
peep
from
a
particular
window
at
a
particular
view,
whence
Briarfield
church
and
rectory
are
visible,
pleasantly
bowered
in
trees.
She
has
scarcely
returned,
and
again
taken
up
the
slip
of
cambric
or
square
of
half
wrought
canvas,
when
Tartar's
bold
scrape
and
strangled
whistle
are
heard
at
the
porch
door,
and
she
must
run
to
open
it
for
him.
It
is
a
hot
day;
he
comes
in
panting;
she
must
convoy
him
to
the
kitchen,
and
see
with
her
own
eyes
that
his
water
bowl
is
replenished.
Through
the
open
kitchen
door
the
court
is
visible,
all
sunny
and
gay,
and
people
with
turkeys
and
their
poults,
peahens
and
their
chicks,
pearl
flecked
Guinea
fowls,
and
a
bright
variety
of
pure
white,
and
purple
necked,
and
blue
and
cinnamon
plumed
pigeons.
Irresistible
