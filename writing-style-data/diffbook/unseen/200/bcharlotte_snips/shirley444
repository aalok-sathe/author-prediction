matter,"
responded
Miss
Keeldar.
"All
my
comfort,"
she
added
presently,
"is
broken
up
by
his
maneauvres.
He
keeps
intruding
between
you
and
me.
Without
him
we
should
be
good
friends;
but
that
six
feet
of
puppyhood
makes
a
perpetually
recurring
eclipse
of
our
friendship.
Again
and
again
he
crosses
and
obscures
the
disc
I
want
always
to
see
clear;
ever
and
anon
he
renders
me
to
you
a
mere
bore
and
nuisance."
"No,
Shirley,
no."
"He
does.
You
did
not
want
my
society
this
afternoon,
and
I
feel
it
hard.
You
are
naturally
somewhat
reserved,
but
I
am
a
social
personage,
who
cannot
live
alone.
If
we
were
but
left
unmolested,
I
have
that
regard
for
you
that
I
could
bear
you
in
my
presence
for
ever,
and
not
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
do
I
ever
wish
to
be
rid
of
you.
You
cannot
say
as
much
respecting
me."
"Shirley,
I
can
say
anything
you
wish.
Shirley,
I
like
you."
"You
will
wish
me
at
Jericho
to
morrow,
Lina."
"I
shall
not.
I
am
every
day
growing
more
accustomed
to
fonder
of
you.
You
know
I
am
too
English
to
get
up
a
vehement
friendship
all
at
once;
