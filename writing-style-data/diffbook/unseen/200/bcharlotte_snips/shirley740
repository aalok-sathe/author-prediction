fancy
me
a
slim
young
person,
attired
in
scanty
drapery
of
white
muslin,
with
bare
arms,
bracelets
and
necklace
of
beads,
and
hair
disposed
in
round
Grecian
curls
above
my
forehead?"
"You
must,
indeed,
have
been
different.
Mamma,
I
heard
the
front
door
open.
If
it
is
my
uncle
coming
in,
just
ask
him
to

tea?
I
made
it
for
you
just

I
like

"I
drank
it

uncle.
It
did
me

it
has
made
me
quite
alive.
I
have
a
wish
for
company,
so
I
begged
Mrs.
Pryor
to
call
you
in."
The
respected
ecclesiastic
looked
pleased,
and
