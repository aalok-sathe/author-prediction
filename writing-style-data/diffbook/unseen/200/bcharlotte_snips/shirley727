hearing
the
strain,
stole
to
the
stair
foot
to
listen.
Even
old
Helstone,
as
he
walked
in
the
garden,
pondering
over
the
unaccountable
and
feeble
nature
of
women,
stood
still
amongst
his
borders
to
catch
the
mournful
melody
more
distinctly.
Why
it
reminded
him
of
his
forgotten
dead
wife,
he
could
not
tell;
nor
why
it
made
him
more
concerned
than
he
had
hitherto
been
for
Caroline's
fading
girlhood.
He
was
glad
to
recollect
that
he
had
promised
to
pay
Wynne,
the
magistrate,
a
visit
that
evening.
Low
spirits
and
gloomy
thoughts
were
very
much
his
aversion.
When
they
attacked
him
he
usually
found
means
to
make
them
march
in
double
quick
time.
The
hymn
followed
him
faintly
as
he
crossed
the
fields.
He
hastened
his
customary
sharp
pace,
that
he
might
get
beyond
its
reach.
"Thy
word
commands
our
flesh
to
dust,
'Return,
ye
sons
of
men;'
All
nations
rose
from
earth
at
first,
And
turn
to
earth
again.
"A
thousand
ages
in
Thy
sight
Are
like
an
evening
gone
Short
as
the
watch
that
ends
the
night
Before
the
rising
sun.
"Time,
like
an
ever
rolling
stream,
Bears
all
its
sons
away;
They
fly,
forgotten,
as
a
dream
