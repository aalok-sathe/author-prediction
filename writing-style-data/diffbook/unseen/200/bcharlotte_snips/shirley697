They
knew
they
had
lost
something
whose
absence
could
never
be
quite
atoned
for
so
long
as
they
lived;
and
they
knew
that
heavy
falling
rain
was
soaking
into
the
wet
earth
which
covered
their
lost
darling,
and
that
the
sad,
sighing
gale
was
mourning
above
her
buried
head.
The
fire
warmed
them;
life
and
friendship
yet
blessed
them;
but
Jessie
lay
cold,
coffined,
solitary
only
the
sod
screening
her
from
the
storm.
Mrs.
Yorke
folded
up
her
knitting,
cut
short
the
music
lesson
and
the
lecture
on
politics,
and
concluded
her
visit
to
the
cottage,
at
an
hour
early
enough
to
ensure
her
return
to
Briarmains
before
the
blush
of
sunset
should
quite
have
faded
in
heaven,
or
the
path
up
the
fields
have
become
thoroughly
moist
with
evening
dew.
The
lady
and
her
daughters
being
gone,
Caroline
felt
that
she
also
ought
to
resume
her
scarf,
kiss
her
cousin's
cheek,
and
trip
away
homeward.
If
she
lingered
much
later
dusk
would
draw
on,
and
Fanny
would
be
put
to
the
trouble
of
coming
to
fetch
her.
It
was
both
baking
and
ironing
day
at
the
rectory,
she
remembered
Fanny
would
be
busy.
Still,
she
could
not
quit
her
