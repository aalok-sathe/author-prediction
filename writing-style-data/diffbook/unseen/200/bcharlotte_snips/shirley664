a
black
swan
or
a
white
crow
in
the
midst
of
this
party,
and
very
forlorn
was
her
aspect.
Having
brought
her
into
respectable
society,
we
will
leave
her
there
a
while,
and
look
after
Miss
Helstone.
Separated
from
Miss
Keeldar
for
the
present,
as
she
could
not
seek
her
in
the
midst
of
her
fine
relatives,
scared
away
from
Fieldhead
by
the
visiting
commotion
which
the
new
arrivals
occasioned
in
the
neighbourhood,
Caroline
was
limited
once
more
to
the
gray
rectory,
the
solitary
morning
walk
in
remote
by
paths,
the
long,
lonely
afternoon
sitting
in
a
quiet
parlour
which
the
sun
forsook
at
noon,
or
in
the
garden
alcove
where
it
shone
bright,
yet
sad,
on
the
ripening
red
currants
trained
over
the
trellis,
and
on
the
fair
monthly
roses
entwined
between,
and
through
them
fell
chequered
on
Caroline
sitting
in
her
white
summer
dress,
still
as
a
garden
statue.
There
she
read
old
books,
taken
from
her
uncle's
library.
The
Greek
and
Latin
were
of
no
use
to
her,
and
its
collection
of
light
literature
was
chiefly
contained
on
a
shelf
which
had
belonged
to
her
aunt
Mary
some
venerable
Lady's
Magazines,
that
had
once
performed
a
