"Ah!"
said
the
rector,
taking
out
his
snuff
box,
and
administering
to
himself
a
very
long
pinch
"ah!
couldn't
have
supposed
it.
Why,
the
pious
man
never
was
a
workman
of
yours,
Moore.
He's
a
tailor
by
trade."
"And
so
much
the
worse
grudge
I
owe
him,
for
interfering
and
setting
my
discarded
men
against
me."
"And
Moses
was
actually
present
at
the
battle
of
Stilbro'
Moor?
He
went
there,
wooden
leg
and
all?"
"Ay,
sir,"
said
Joe;
"he

objections.
He
courted
Sarah,
Mr.
Moore's
sarvant
lass,
and
so
it
seems
she
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
him;
she
either
didn't
like
his
wooden
leg
or
she'd
some
notion
about
his
being
a
hypocrite.
Happen
(for
women

we
may
say
that

there's

she'd
have
encouraged
him,
in
spite
of
his
leg
and
his
deceit,
just

pass
time
