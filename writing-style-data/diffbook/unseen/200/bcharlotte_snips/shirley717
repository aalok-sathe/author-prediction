pillow,
and
drew
the
coverlets
close
round
her,
as
if
to
shut
out
the
world
and
sun,
of
which
she
was
tired.
More
than
once,
as
she
thus
lay,
a
slight
convulsion
shook
the
sick
bed,
and
a
faint
sob
broke
the
silence
round
it.
These
things
were
not
unnoted
by
Mrs.
Pryor.
One
Tuesday
morning,
as
usual,
she
had
asked
leave
to
rise,
and
now
she
sat
wrapped
in
her
white
dressing
gown,
leaning
forward
in
the
easy
chair,
gazing
steadily
and
patiently
from
the
lattice.
Mrs.
Pryor
was
seated
a
little
behind,
knitting
as
it
seemed,

her
pale,
mournful
brow,
animating
its
languor;
a
light

into
her
faded
eyes,
reviving
their
lustre;
she
half
rose
and
looked
earnestly
out.
Mrs.
Pryor,
drawing
softly
near,
glanced
over
her
shoulder.
From
this
window
was
visible
the
churchyard,
beyond
it
the
road;
and
there,
riding
sharply
by,
appeared
a
horseman.
The
figure
was
not
yet
too
remote
for
recognition.
Mrs.
Pryor
had
long
sight;
she
knew
Mr.
Moore.
Just
as
an
intercepting
rising
ground
concealed
him
from
view,
the
clock
struck
twelve.
"May
I
lie
down
again?"
asked
Caroline.
Her
nurse
