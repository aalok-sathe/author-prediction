Indefatigable
in
her
exertions
where
good
was
to
be
done,
Miss
Ainley
would
immediately
have
set
out
on
a
walk
of
ten
miles
round
to
the
three
rectors,
in
order
to
show
her
plan,
and
humbly
solicit
their
approval;
but
Miss
Keeldar
interdicted
this,
and
proposed,
as
an
amendment,
to
collect
the
clergy
in
a
small
select
reunion
that
evening
at
Fieldhead.
Miss
Ainley
was
to
meet
them,
and
the
plan
was
to
be
discussed
in
full
privy
council.
Shirley
managed
to
get
the
senior
priesthood
together
accordingly,
and
before
the
old
maid's
arrival,
she
had,
further,
talked
all
the
gentlemen
into
the
most
charming
mood
imaginable.
She
herself
had
taken
in
hand
Dr.
Boultby
and
Mr.
Helstone.
The
first
was
a
stubborn
old
Welshman,
hot,
opinionated,
and
obstinate,
but
withal
a
man
who
did
a
great
deal
of
good,
though
not
without
making
some
noise
about
it.
The
latter
we
know.
She
had
rather
a
friendly
feeling
for
both,
especially
for
old
Helstone;
and
it
cost
her
no
trouble
to
be
quite
delightful
to
them.
She
took
them
round
the
garden;
she
gathered
them
flowers;
she
was
like
a
kind
daughter
to
them.
Mr.
Hall
she
left
