therefore,
without
running
the
smallest
danger
of
being
servile;
and
their
unthinking,
easy,
artless
insensibility
was
as
acceptable,
because
as
convenient,
to
Mr.
Yorke
as
that
of
the
chair
he
sat
on,
or
of
the
floor
he
trod.
It
will
have
been
observed
that
he
was
not
quite
uncordial
with
Mr.
Moore.
He
had
two
or
three
reasons
for
entertaining
a
faint
partiality
to
that
gentleman.
It
may
sound
odd,
but
the
first
of
these
was
that
Moore
spoke
English
with
a
foreign,
and
French
with
a
perfectly
pure,
accent;
and
that
his
dark,
thin
face,
with
its
fine
though
rather
wasted
lines,
had
a
most
anti
British
and
anti
Yorkshire
look.
These
points
seem
frivolous,
unlikely
to
influence
a
character
like
Yorke's;
but
the
fact
is
they
recalled
old,
perhaps
pleasurable,
associations
they
brought
back
his
travelling,
his
youthful
days.
He
had
seen,
amidst
Italian
cities
and
scenes,
faces
like
Moore's;
he
had
heard,
in
Parisian
cafes
and
theatres,
voices
like
his.
He
was
young
then,
and
when
he
looked
at
and
listened
to
the
alien,
he
seemed
young
again.
Secondly,
he
had
known
Moore's
father,
and
had
had
dealings
with
him.
That
was
a
more
substantial,
though
by
