scarcely
suit
her,
as
they
were
most
of
them,
he
was
informed,
completely
ignorant
of
household
work;
and
pert
and
self
willed
as
Sarah
was,
she
was,
perhaps,
no
worse
than
the
majority
of
the
women
of
her
class.
Mademoiselle
admitted
the
truth
of
this
conjecture:
according
to
her,
"ces
paysannes
anglaises
etaient
tout
insupportables."
What
would
she
not
give
for
some
"bonne
cuisiniere
anversoise,"
with
the
high
cap,
short
petticoat,
and
decent
sabots
proper
to
her
class
something
better,
indeed,
than
an
insolent
coquette
in
a
flounced
gown,
and
absolutely
without
cap!
(For
Sarah,
it

did
not
partake
the
opinion
of
St.
Paul
that
"it
is
a
shame
for
a
woman
to
go
with
her
head
uncovered;"
but,
holding
rather
a
contrary
doctrine,
resolutely
refused
to
imprison
in
linen
or
muslin
the
plentiful
tresses
of
her
yellow
hair,
which
it
was
her
wont
to
fasten
up
smartly
with
a
comb
behind,
and
on
Sundays
to
wear
curled
in
front.)
"Shall
I
try
and
get
you
an
Antwerp
girl?"
asked
Mr.
Moore,
who,
stern
in
public,
was
on
the
whole
very
kind
in
private.
"Merci
du
cadeau!"
was
the
answer.
"An
