he

throat
his
head?
Should
it
be

or
a
turban?
Neither.
Peter
Augustus
had
an
inventive,
an
original
genius.
He
was
about
to
show
the
ladies
graces
of
action
possessing
at
least
the
charm
of
novelty.
He
sat
on
the
chair
with
his
athletic
Irish
legs
crossed,
and
these
legs,
in
that
attitude,
he
circled
with
the
bandana
and
bound
firmly
together.
It
was
evident
he
felt
this
device
to
be
worth
an
encore;
he
repeated
it
more
than
once.
The
second
performance
sent
Shirley
to
the
window,
to
laugh
her
silent
but
irrepressible
laugh
unseen;
it
turned
Caroline's
head
aside,
that
her
long
curls
might
screen
the
smile
mantling
on
her
features.
Miss
Helstone,
indeed,
was
amused
by
more
than
one
point
in
Peter's
demeanour.
She
was
edified
at
the
complete
though
abrupt
diversion
of
his
homage
from
herself
to
the
heiress.
The
5,000
he
supposed
her
likely
one
day
to
inherit
were
not
to
be
weighed
in
the
balance
against
Miss
Keeldar's
estate
and
hall.
He
took
no
pains
to
conceal
his
calculations
and
tactics.
He
pretended
to
no
gradual
change
of
views;
he
wheeled
about
at
once.
The
pursuit
of
the
