had
their
marriage
been?
Caroline,
turning
from
the
lattice,
whence
she
had
been
watching
the
starlings
(though
without
seeing
them),
in
a
low
voice,
and
with
a
sad,
bitter
tone,
thus
broke
the
silence
of
the
room,
"You
term
marriage
miserable,
I
suppose,
from
what
you
saw
of
my
father
and
mother's.
If
my
mother
suffered
what
I
suffered
when
I
was
with
papa,
she
must
have
had
a
dreadful
life."
Mr.
Helstone,
thus
addressed,
wheeled
about
in
his
chair,
and
looked
over
his
spectacles
at
his
niece.
He
was
taken
aback.
Her
father
and
mother!
What
had
put
it
into
her
head
to
mention
her
father
and
mother,
of
whom
he
had
never,
during
the
twelve
years
she
had
lived
with
him,
spoken
to
her?
That
the
thoughts
were
self
matured,
that
she
had
any
recollections
or
speculations
about
her
parents,
he
could
not
fancy.
"Your
father
and
mother?
Who
has
been
talking
to
you
about
them?"
"Nobody;
but
I
remember
something
of
what
papa
was,
and
I
pity
mamma.
Where
is
she?"
This
"Where
is
she?"
had
been
on
Caroline's
lips
hundreds
of
times
before,
but
till
now
she
had
never
uttered
it.
"I
hardly
know,"
returned
Mr.
