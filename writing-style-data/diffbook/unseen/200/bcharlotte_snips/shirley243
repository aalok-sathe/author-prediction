looking
gentleman
Farren
I
think
his
name
is
I
opened
this
back
window,
shouted
to
Murgatroyd,
who
was
in
the
stable,
to
bring
Mr.
Sykes's
gig
round;
then
I
smuggled
Sugden
and
brother
Moses
wooden
leg
and
all
through
the
aperture,
and
saw
them
mount
the
gig
(always
with
our
good
friend
Sykes's
permission,
of
course).
Sugden
took
the
reins
he
drives
like
Jehu
and

another
quarter
of
an
hour
Barraclough
will
be
safe
in
Stilbro'
jail."
"Very
good;
thank

said
Moore;
"and
good
morning,
gentlemen,"
he
added,
and
so
politely
conducted
them
to
the
door,

his
premises.
He
was
a
taciturn,

He
did

repartee
with
Joe
Scott,
who,
for
his
part,
said
to
his
master
only
just
what
was
absolutely
necessary
to
the
progress
of
business,
but
looked
at
him
a
good
deal
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes,
frequently
came
to
poke
the
counting
house
fire
for
him,
and
once,
as
he
was
locking
up
for
the
day
(the
mill
was
then
working
short
time,
owing
to
the
slackness
of
trade),
observed
that
it
was
a
grand
evening,
and
