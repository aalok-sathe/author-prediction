number
was
Mr.
Sympson.
"I
disappointed?
What
is
it
to
me?
Have
I
an
interest
in
it?
You
would
insinuate,
perhaps,
that
I
have
motives?"
"Most
people
have
motives
of
some
sort
for
their
actions."
"She
accuses
me
to
my
face!
I,
that
have
been
a
parent
to
her,
she
charges
with
bad
motives!"
"Bad
motives
I
did
not
say."
"And

prevaricate;

have

not
bear
that."
"You
read
French.
Your
mind
is
poisoned
with
French
novels.
You
have
imbibed
French
principles."
"The
ground
you
are
treading
now
returns
a
mighty
hollow
sound
under
your
feet.
Beware!"
"It
will
end
in
infamy,
sooner
or
later.
I
have
foreseen
it
all
along."
"Do
you
assert,
sir,
that
something
in
which
I
am
concerned
will
end
in
infamy?"
"That
