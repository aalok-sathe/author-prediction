have
seen
it
if
he
would;
whether
he
did
see
it,
nothing
indicated.
"Good
night!"
she
said,
shaking
like
a
leaf,
offering
her
thin
hand
hastily,
anxious
to
part
from
him
quickly.
"You
are
going
home?"
he
asked,
not
touching
her
hand.
"Yes."
"Is
Fanny
come
for
you?"
"Yes."
"I
may
as
well
accompany
you
a
step
of
the
way;
not
up
to
the
rectory,
though,
lest
my
old
friend
Helstone
should
shoot
me
from
the
window."
He
laughed,
and
took
his
hat.
Caroline
spoke
of
unnecessary
trouble;
he
told
her
to
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl.
She
was
quickly
ready,
and
they
were
soon
both
in
the
open
air.
Moore
drew
her
hand
under
his
arm,
just
in
his
old
manner
that
manner
which
she
ever
felt
to
be
so
kind.
"You
may
run
on,
Fanny,"
he
said
to
the
housemaid;
"we
shall
overtake
you."
And
when
the
girl
had
got
a
little
in
advance,
he
enclosed
Caroline's
hand
in
his,
and
said
he
was
glad
to
find
she
was
a
familiar
guest
at
Fieldhead.
He
hoped
her
intimacy
with
Miss
Keeldar
would
continue;
such
society
would
be
both
pleasant
and
improving.
Caroline
replied
that
she
liked
Shirley.
