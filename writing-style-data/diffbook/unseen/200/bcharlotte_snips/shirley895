There
is
a
sort
of
wild
cat
in
my
breast,
and
I
choose
that
you
shall
hear
how
it
can
yell."
"To
me
it
is
music.
What
grand
voices
you
and
Louis
have!
When
Louis
sings
tones
off
like
a
soft,
deep
bell
I've
felt
myself
tremble
again.
The
night
is
still.
It
listens.
It
is
just
leaning
down
to
you,
like
a
black
priest
to
a
blacker
penitent.
Confess,
lad.
Smooth
naught
down.
Be
candid
as
a
convicted,
justified,
sanctified
Methody
at
an
experience
meeting.
Make
yourself
as
wicked
as
Beelzebub.
It
will
ease
your
mind."
"As
mean
as
Mammon,
you
would
say.
Yorke,
if
I
got
off
horseback
and
laid
myself
down
across
the
road,
would
you
have
the
goodness
to
gallop
over
me,
backwards
and
forwards,
about
twenty
times?"
"Wi'
all
the
pleasure
in
life,
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
a
coroner's
inquest."
"Hiram
Yorke,
I
certainly
believed
she
loved
me.
I
have
seen
her
eyes
sparkle
radiantly
when
she
has
found
me
out
in
a
crowd;
she
has
flushed
up
crimson
when
she
has
offered
me
her
hand,
and
said,
'How
do
you
do,
Mr.
Moore?'
"My
name
had
a
magical
influence
over
her.
