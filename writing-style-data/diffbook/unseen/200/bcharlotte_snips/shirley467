Oh!
I
know
that
sort
of
character,
or
something
in
the
same
style.
It
is
one
that
piques
me
singularly.
How
does
it
affect
you?"
This
question
was
a
specimen
of
one
of
Shirley's
sharp,
sudden
turns.
Caroline
used
to
be
fluttered
by
them
at
first,
but

There

the
bell
and,
by
all
that's
delicious!

then,
except
in
couples?
You
may
have
one,
Lina,
and
you
may
take
your
choice.

hope
I
am
generous
enough.
