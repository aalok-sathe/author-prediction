indeed,
as
Martin
set
his
face
homeward,
he
felt
that
the
sleet
was
sharp
and
the
east
wind
cold.
His
nearest
way
lay
through
some
fields.
It
was
a
dangerous,
because
an
untrodden
way.
He
did
not
care;
he
would
take
it.
Near
the
second
stile
rose
a
clump
of
trees.
Was
that
an
umbrella
waiting
there?
Yes,
an
umbrella,
held
with
evident
difficulty
against
the
blast;
behind

Martin

had
better
strike
a
bargain.
Exchange
me
for
Mrs.
Pryor."
"I
was
not
sure
whether
you
would
come
this
way,
Martin,
but
I
thought
I
would
run
the
chance.
There
is
no
such
thing
as
getting
a
quiet
word
spoken
in
the
church
or
churchyard."
"Will
you
agree?
make
over
Mrs.
Pryor
to
my
mother,
and
put
me
in
her
skirts?"
"As

I
