soothed
almost
as
soon
as
felt.
As
to
the
mother,
she
spent
the
night
like
Jacob
at
Peniel.
Till
break
of
day
she
wrestled
with
God
in
earnest
prayer.
Not
always
do
those
who
dare
such
divine
conflict
prevail.
Night
after
night
the
sweat
of
agony
may
burst
dark
on
the
forehead;
the
supplicant
may
cry
for
mercy
with
that
soundless
voice
the
soul
utters
when
its
appeal
is
to
the
Invisible.
"Spare
my
beloved,"
it
may
implore.
"Heal
my
life's
life.
Rend
not
from
me
what
long
affection
entwines
with
my
whole
nature.
God
of
heaven,
bend,
hear,
be
clement!"
And
after
this
cry
and
strife
the
sun
may
rise
and
see
him
worsted.
That
opening
morn,
which
used
to
salute
him
with
the
whisper
of
zephyrs,
the
carol
of
skylarks,
may
breathe,
as
its
first
accents,
from
the
dear
lips
which
colour
and
heat
have
quitted,
"Oh!
I
have
had
a
suffering
night.
This
morning
I
am
worse.
I
have
tried
to
rise.
I
cannot.
Dreams
I
am
unused
to
have
troubled
me."
Then
the
watcher
approaches
the
patient's
pillow,
and
sees
a
new
and
strange
moulding
of
the
familiar
features,
feels
at
once
that
the
insufferable
moment
