is
out
of
work,
like
many
others,
unfortunately.
Mr.
Grame,
Sir
Philip
Nunnely's
steward,
gave
him
a
job
about
the
priory.
According
to
his
account,
Mike
was
busy
hedging
rather
late
in
the
afternoon,
but
before
dark,
when
he
heard
what
he
thought
was
a
band
at
a
distance
bugles,
fifes,
and
the
sound
of
a
trumpet;
it
came
from
the
forest,
and
he
wondered
that
there
should
be
music
there.
He
looked
up.
All
amongst
the
trees
he
saw
moving
objects,
red,
like
poppies,
or
white,
like
may
blossom.
The
wood
was
full
of
them;
they
poured
out
and
filled
the
park.
He
then
perceived
they
were
soldiers
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands;
but
they
made
no
more
noise
than
a
swarm
of
midges
on
a
summer
evening.
They
formed
in
order,
he
affirmed,
and
marched,
regiment
after
regiment,
across
the
park.
He
followed
them
to
Nunnely
Common;
the
music
still
played
soft
and
distant.
On
the
common
he
watched
them
go
through
a
number
of
evolutions.
A
man
clothed
in
scarlet
stood
in
the
centre
and
directed
them.
They
extended,
he
declared,
over
fifty
acres.
They
were
in
sight
half
an
hour;
then
they
marched
away
quite
silently.
