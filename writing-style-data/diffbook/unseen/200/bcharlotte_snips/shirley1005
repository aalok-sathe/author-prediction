the
kitchen,
quietly
tripped
up
Sarah's
stairs
to
take
off
her
bonnet
and
furs,
and
came
down
as
quietly,
with
her
beautiful
curls
nicely
smoothed,
her
graceful
merino
dress
and
delicate
collar
all
trim
and
spotless,
her
gay
little
work
bag
in
her
hand.
She
lingered
to
exchange
a
few
kindly
words
with
Sarah,
and
to
look
at
the
new
tortoise
shell
kitten
basking
on
the
kitchen
hearth,
and
to
speak
to
the
canary
bird,
which
a
sudden
blaze
from
the
fire
had
startled
on
its
perch;
and
then
she
betook
herself
to
the
parlour.
The
gentle
salutation,
the
friendly
welcome,
were
interchanged
in
such
tranquil
sort
as
befitted
cousins
meeting;
a
sense
of
pleasure,
subtle
and
quiet
as
a
perfume,
diffused
itself
through
the
room;
the
newly
kindled
lamp
burnt
up
bright;
the
tray
and
the
singing
urn
were
brought
in.
"I
am
pleased
to
come
home,"
repeated
Mr.
Moore.
They
assembled
round
the
table.
Hortense
chiefly
talked.
She
congratulated
Caroline
on
the
evident
improvement
in
her
health.
Her
colour
and
her
plump
cheeks
were
returning,
she
remarked.
It
was
true.
There
was
an
obvious
change
in
Miss
Helstone.
All
about
her
seemed
elastic;
depression,
fear,
forlornness,
were
withdrawn.
