the
duties
and
affections
of
wife
and
mother
to
occupy
my
existence.
I
considered,
somehow,
as
a
matter
of
course,
that
I
was
growing
up
to
the
ordinary
destiny,
and
never
troubled
myself
to
seek
any
other;
but
now
I
perceive
plainly
I
may
have
been
mistaken.
Probably
I
shall
be
an
old
maid.
I
shall
live
to
see
Robert
married
to
some
one
else,
some
rich
lady.
I
shall
never
marry.
What
was
I
created
for,
I
wonder?
Where
is
my
place
in
the
world?"
She
mused
again.
"Ah!
I
see,"
she
pursued
presently;
"that
is
the
question
which
most
old
maids
are
puzzled
to
solve.
Other
people
solve
it
for
them
by
saying,
'Your
place
is
to
do
good
to
others,
to
be
helpful
whenever
help
is
wanted.'
That
is
right
in
some
measure,
and
a
very
convenient
doctrine
for
the
people
who
hold
it;
but
I
perceive
that
certain
sets
of
human
beings
are
very
apt
to
maintain
that
other
sets
should
give
up
their
lives
to
them
and
their
service,
and
then
they
requite
them
by
praise;
they
call
them
devoted
and
virtuous.
Is
this
enough?
Is
it
to
live?
Is
there
not
a
terrible
hollowness,
