blue
of
heaven
above,
pours
a
wondrous
descent,
dread
as
the
downrushing
of
stars.
He
has
what
he
asked.
Withdraw
forbear
to
look
I
am
blinded.
I
hear
in
that
fane
an
unspeakable
sound.
Would
that
I
could
not
hear
it!
I
see
an
insufferable
glory
burning
terribly
between
the
pillars.
Gods
be
merciful
and
quench
it!
"A
pious
Argive
enters
to
make
an
early
offering
in
the
cool
dawn

was
thunder
in
the
night;

bolt
fell
here.
The
shrine
is
shivered,
the
marble
pavement

split
and
blackened.

will
be
seen
no
more.

is
the
carriage!
Let
me
lock
up
the
desk
and
pocket
the
keys.
She
will
be
seeking
them
to
morrow;
she
will
have
to
come
to
me.
I
hear
her:
'Mr.
Moore,
have
you
seen
my
keys?'
"So
she
will
say,
in
her
clear
voice,
speaking
with
reluctance,
looking
ashamed,
conscious
that
this
is
the
twentieth
time
of
asking.
I
will
tantalize
her,
keep
her
with
me,
expecting,
doubting;
and
when
I
do
restore
them,
it
shall
not
be
without
a
lecture.
