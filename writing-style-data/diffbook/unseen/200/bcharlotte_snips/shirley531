did
perhaps
he
meant
to
speak
to
her;
but
there
was
yet
a
parting
word
to
exchange
with
Miss
Keeldar,
and
while
it
was
being
uttered
Caroline
had
vanished.
Hortense
received
her
former
pupil
with
a
demeanour
of
more
dignity
than
warmth.
She
had
been
seriously
offended
by
Mr.
Helstone's
proceedings,
and
had
all
along
considered
Caroline
to
blame
in
obeying
her
uncle
too
literally.
"You
are

she
said
austerely,
as
her
pupil
held

get
the
upper

It
did.
Hortense
had
no
sooner
examined
her
face
well,
and
observed
the
change
its
somewhat
wasted
features
betrayed,
than
her
mien
softened.
Kissing
her
on
both
cheeks,
she
asked
anxiously
after
her
health.
Caroline
answered
gaily.
It
would,
however,
have
been
her
lot
to
undergo
a
long
cross
examination,
followed
by
an
endless
lecture
on
this
head,
had
not
Miss
Mann
called
off
the
attention
