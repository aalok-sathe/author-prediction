talking
with
Moore,
Caroline
rejoined
Mrs.
Pryor
upstairs.
She
found
that
lady
deeply
depressed.
She
would
not
say
that
Miss
Keeldar's
hastiness
had
hurt
her
feelings,
but
it
was
evident
an
inward
wound
galled
her.
To
any
but
a
congenial
nature
she
would
have
seemed
insensible
to
the
quiet,
tender
attentions
by
which
Miss
Helstone
sought
to
impart
solace;
but
Caroline
knew
that,
unmoved
or
slightly
moved
as
she
looked,
she
felt,
valued,
and
was
healed
by
them.
"I
am
deficient
in
self
confidence
and
decision,"
she
said
at
last.
"I
always
have
been
deficient
in
those
qualities.
Yet
I
think
Miss
Keeldar
should
have
known
my
character
well
enough
by
this
time
to
be
aware
that
I
always
feel
an
even
painful
solicitude
to
do
right,
to
act
for
the
best.
The
unusual
nature
of
the
demand
on
my
judgment
puzzled
me,
especially
following
the
alarms
of
the
night.
I
could
not
venture
to
act
promptly
for
another;
but
I
trust
no
serious
harm
will
result
from
my
lapse
of
firmness."
A
gentle
knock
was
here
heard
at
the
door.
It
was
half
opened.
"Caroline,
come
here,"
said
a
low
voice.
Miss
Helstone
went
out.
There
stood
Shirley
in
