Men
of
Manchester,
I
beg
your
pardon
for
this
slight
resume
of
warlike
facts,
but
it
is
of
no
consequence.
Lord
Wellington
is,
for
you,
only
a
decayed
old
gentleman
now.
I
rather
think
some
of
you
have
called
him
a
"dotard;"
you
have
taunted
him
with
his
age
and
the
loss
of
his
physical
vigour.
What
fine
heroes
you
are

your
scorn
can
never
break
his
grand
old
heart.

your

in
Council
were
repealed,
and
the
blockaded
ports
thrown
open.
You
know
very
well
such
of
you
as
are
old
enough
to
remember
you
made
Yorkshire
and
Lancashire
shake
with
your
shout
on
that
occasion.
The
ringers
cracked
a
bell
in
Briarfield
belfry;
it
is
dissonant
to
this
day.
The
