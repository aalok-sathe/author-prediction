the
white
surplice
in
which
it
was
hereafter
cruelly
to
exercise
the
souls
of
its
parishioners,
and
strangely
to
nonplus
its
old
fashioned
vicar
by
flourishing
aloft
in
a
pulpit
the
shirt
like
raiment
which
had
never
before
waved
higher
than
the
reading
desk.
Yet
even
in
those
days
of
scarcity
there
were
curates:
the

of
one
John
Gale,
a
small
clothier.
Mr.
Donne
has
kindly
invited
his
brethren
to
regale
with
him.
You
and
I
will
join
the
party,
see
what
is
to
be
seen,
and
hear
what
is
to
be
heard.
At
present,
however,
they
are
