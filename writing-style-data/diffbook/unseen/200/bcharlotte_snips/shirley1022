indeed
to
leave
Fieldhead
just
now.
Things
went
on
for
some
time
pretty
smoothly.
Miss
Keeldar's
health
was
re
established;
her
spirits
resumed
their
flow.
Moore
had
found
means
to
relieve
her
from
every
nervous
apprehension;
and,
indeed,
from
the
moment
of
giving
him
her
confidence,
every
fear
seemed
to
have
taken
wing.
Her
heart
became
as
lightsome,
her
manner

as
those
of
a
little
child,
that,

violently.
Their
assertion
might
or
might
not
be
true.
The
groom
and
gamekeeper
affirmed
to
the
contrary
both
asserting
that,
if
hers
was
not
a
clear
case
of
hydrophobia,
there
was
no
such
disease.
But
to
this
evidence
Louis
Moore
turned
an
incredulous
ear.
He
reported
to
Shirley
only
what
was
encouraging.
She
believed

and,
right
