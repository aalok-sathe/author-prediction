know
it
is
but
it
is
the
language
which
naturally
rises
to
my
lips,
therefore
I
utter
it."
"I
would
write
to
you,
Shirley."
"And
what
are
letters?
Only
a
sort
of
pis
aller.
Drink
some
tea,
Caroline.
Eat
something

nothing.
Laugh
and
be

Miss
Helstone
shook
her
head
and
sighed.
She
felt
what
difficulty
she
would
have
to
persuade
any
one
to
assist
or

There

pecuniary
need
for
her
to
leave
a
comfortable
home
and
"take
a
situation;"
and
there
was
every
probability
that
her
uncle
might,
in
some
way,
permanently
provide
for
her.
So
her
friends
thought,
and,
as
far
as
their
lights
enabled
them
to
see,
they
reasoned
correctly;
but

Caroline's
strange
sufferings,
