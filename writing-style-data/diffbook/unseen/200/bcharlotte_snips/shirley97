wi'
blue
and
black
skins,
that
has
a
long
head,
and
that
can
tell
what
a
fooil
of
a
law
is,
as
well
as
ye

Yorke,

a

better

"You
think
yourself
a
clever
fellow,
I
know,
Scott."
"Ay!
I'm
fairish.
I
can
tell
cheese
fro'
chalk,
and
I'm
varry
weel
aware
that
I've
improved
sich
opportunities
as
I
have
had,
a

better

some
'at

there's
thousands

Yorkshire

me,

"You're
a
great
man
you're
a
sublime
fellow;
but
you're
a
prig,
a
conceited
noodle
with
it
all,
Joe!
You
need
not
to
think
that
because
you've
picked
up
a
little
knowledge
of
practical
mathematics,
and
because
you
have
found
some
scantling
of
the
elements
of
chemistry
at
the
bottom
of
a
dyeing
vat,
that
therefore
you're
a
neglected
man
of
science;
and
you
need
not
to
suppose
that
because
the
course
of
trade
does
not
always
run
smooth,
and
you,
and
such
as
you,
