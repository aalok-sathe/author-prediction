be
served,
having
previously
directed
Mrs.
Gill
to
exercise
her
utmost
skill
in
the
preparation
of
this
repast.
Mr.
Hall
was
no
bon
vivant
he
was
naturally
an
abstemious
man,
indifferent
to
luxury;
but
Boultby
and
Helstone
both
liked
good
cookery.
The
recherche
supper
consequently
put
them
into
excellent
humour.

gone
off
so
well.
"I
rather
like
to
entertain
a
circle
of
gentlemen,"
said
she.
"It
is
amusing
to
observe
how
they
enjoy
a
judiciously
concocted
repast.
For
ourselves,
you
see,
these
choice
wines
and
these
scientific
dishes
are
of
no
importance
to
us;
but
gentlemen
seem
to
retain
something
of
the
naivete
of
children
about
food,

that
is,
