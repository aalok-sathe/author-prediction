those
to
whom
it
was
developed.
She
talked
never
of
herself,
always
of
others.
Their
faults
she
passed
over.
Her
theme
was
their
wants,
which
she
sought
to
supply;
their
sufferings,
which
she
longed
to
alleviate.
She
was
religious,
a
professor
of
religion
what
some
would
call
"a
saint;"
and
she
referred
to
religion
often
in
sanctioned
phrase
in
phrase
which
those
who
possess
a
perception
of
the
ridiculous,
without
owning
the
power
of
exactly
testing
and
truly
judging
character,
would
certainly
have
esteemed
a
proper
subject
for
satire,
a
matter
for
mimicry
and
laughter.
They
would
have
been
hugely
mistaken
for
their
pains.
Sincerity
is
never
ludicrous;
it
is
always
respectable.
Whether
truth
be
it
religious
or
moral
truth
speak
eloquently
and
in
well
chosen
language
or
not,
its
voice
should
be
heard
with
reverence.
Let
those
who
cannot
nicely,
and
with
certainty,
discern
the
difference
between
the
tones
of
hypocrisy
and
those
of
sincerity,
never
presume
to
laugh
at
all,
lest
they
should
have
the
miserable
misfortune
to
laugh
in
the
wrong
place,
and
commit
impiety
when
they
think
they
are
achieving
wit.
