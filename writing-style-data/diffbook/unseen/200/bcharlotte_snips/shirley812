of
heath
bloom,
faded
but
not
withered,
tinged
the
hills.
The
beck
wandered
down
to
the
Hollow,
through
a
silent
district;
no
wind
followed
its
course
or
haunted
its
woody
borders.
Fieldhead
gardens
bore
the
seal
of
gentle
decay.
On
the
walks,
swept
that
morning,
yellow
leaves
had
fluttered
down
again.
Its
time
of
flowers,
and
even
of
fruits,
was
over;
but
a
scantling
of
apples
enriched
the
trees.
Only
a
blossom
here
and
there
expanded
pale

amidst

Shirley
culled
as

the
house.
"Shirley,
Mr.
Moore
would
be
glad
to
see
you
in
the
schoolroom
and
to
hear
you
read
a
little
French,
if
you
have
no
more
urgent
occupation."
The
messenger
delivered
his
commission
very
simply,
as
if
it
were
a
mere
matter
of
course.
"Did
Mr.
Moore
tell
you
to
say
that?"
"Certainly;
why
not?
And
now,
do
come,
and
let

be

were
at
Sympson
Grove.
We
used
