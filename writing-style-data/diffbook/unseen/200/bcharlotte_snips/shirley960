She
leaned
against
a
tree,
trembling,
shuddering,
and
as
pale
as
death.
Martin
contemplated
her
with
inexpressible
curiosity.
In
one
sense
it
was,
as
he
would
have
expressed
it,
"nuts"
to
him
to
see
this.
It
told
him
so
much,
and
he
was
beginning
to
have
a
great
relish

In
another
sense
it
reminded
him
of
what
he
had

Miss
Caroline.
Walk
forward,"
he
urged.
Not
reflecting
that
it
would
be
more
difficult
for
Miss
Helstone
than
for
himself
to
climb
a
wall
or
penetrate
a
hedge,
he
piloted
her
by
a
short
cut
which
led
to
no
gate.
The
consequence
