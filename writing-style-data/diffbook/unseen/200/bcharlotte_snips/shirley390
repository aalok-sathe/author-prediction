she
were
within
call;
no
spectacle
did
she
ask
but
that
of
the
deep
blue
sky,
and
such
cloudlets
as
sailed
afar
and
aloft
across
its
span;
no
sound
but
that
of
the
bee's
hum,
the
leaf's
whisper.
Her
sole
book
in
such
hours
was
the
dim
chronicle
of
memory
or
the
sibyl
page
of
anticipation.
From
her
young
eyes
fell
on
each

round
her
lips
at
moments

Shirley's
cheek
was
wet
as
if
with
dew;
those
fine
eyes
of
hers
shone
humid
and
brimming.
"Shirley,
why
do
you
cry?"
asked
Caroline,
involuntarily
laying
stress
on
you.
Miss
Keeldar
smiled,
and
turned
her
picturesque
head
towards
the
questioner.
"Because
it
pleases
me
mightily
to

heart
is
