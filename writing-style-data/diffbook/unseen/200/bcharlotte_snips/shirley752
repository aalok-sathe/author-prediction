great
gulf
lay
between
her
caste
and
his,
and
that
to
cross
it
or
meet
him
half
way
would
be
to
degrade
herself.
She
gently
asked
Caroline,
"Are
you
not
afraid,
my
dear,
to
converse
with
that
person
so
unreservedly?
He
may
presume,
and
become
troublesomely
garrulous."
"William
presume,
mamma?
You
don't
know
him.
He
never
presumes.
He
is
altogether
too
proud
and
sensitive
to
do
so.
William
has
very
fine
feelings."
And
Mrs.
Pryor
smiled
sceptically
at
the
naive
notion
of
that
rough
handed,
rough
headed,
fustian
clad
clown
having
"fine
feelings."
Farren,
for
his
part,
showed
Mrs.
Pryor
only
a
very
sulky
brow.
He
knew
when
he
was
misjudged,
and
was
apt
to
turn
unmanageable
with
such
as
failed
to
give
him
his
due.
The
evening
restored
Caroline
entirely
to
her
mother,
and
Mrs.
Pryor
liked
the
evening;
for
then,
alone
with
her
daughter,
no
human
shadow
came
between
her
and
what
she
loved.
During
the
day
she
would
have
her
stiff
demeanour
and
cool
moments,
as
was
her
wont.
Between
her
and
Mr.
Helstone
a
very
respectful
but
most
rigidly
ceremonious
intercourse
was
kept
up.
Anything
like
familiarity
would
have
bred
contempt
at
once
in
one
or
