air,
bearing
the
perfume
of
flowers
from
the
garden,
the
very
distant
sound
of
far
retreating
steps
from
the
road,
and
a
soft,
vague
murmur
whose
origin
Caroline
explained
by
the
remark,
uttered
as
she
stood
listening
at
the
casement,
"Shirley,
I

somewhat

sultry
room.
In
returning
she
half
opened
a
drawer,
and
took

it
something

glittered
clear
and
keen

her
hand.

Shirley,
