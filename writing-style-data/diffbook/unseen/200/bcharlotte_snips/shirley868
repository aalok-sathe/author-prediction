to
withdraw.
Pray,
sir,
admire
in
her
hauteur
a
careful
improvement
on
your
own
coolness."
"Conscience,
and
honour,
and
the
most
despotic
necessity
dragged
me
apart
from
her,
and
kept
me
sundered
with
ponderous
fetters.
She
was
free:
she
might
have
been
clement."
"Never

to
compromise
her
self

seek
where
she
had
been
shunned."
"Then
she

and
then
she
would
sometimes
get
a
notion
