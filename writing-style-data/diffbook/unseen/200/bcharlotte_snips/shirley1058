its
mistress
mine?
I
am
not
easy,
not
tranquil;
I
am
tantalized,
sometimes
tortured.
To
see
her
now,
one
would
think
she
had
never
pressed
her
cheek
to
my
shoulder,
or
clung
to
me
with
tenderness
or
trust.
I
feel
unsafe;
she
renders
me
miserable.
I
am
shunned
when
I
visit
her;
she
withdraws
from

reach.
Once
this

I

she
should
lose
me,
as
there
is
risk
I
shall
lose
her.
No;
final
loss
I
do
not
fear,
but
long
delay
"It
is
now
night
midnight.
I
have
spent
the
afternoon
and
evening
at
Fieldhead.
Some
hours
ago
she
passed
me,
coming
down
the
oak
staircase
to
the
hall.
She
did
not
know

was
standing
in
the
twilight,
near
the
staircase
window,
