wishing
to
get
well
will
help
me,
I
shall
not
be
long
sick.
This
morning
I
had
no
reason
and
no
strength
to
wish
it."
Fanny
here
tapped
at
the
door,
and
said
that
supper
was
ready.
"Uncle,
if
you
please,
you
may
send
me
a
little
bit
of
supper
anything
you
like,
from
your
own
plate.
That
is
wiser
than
going
into
hysterics,
is
it
not?"
"It
is
spoken
like
a
sage,
Cary.
See
if
I
don't
cater
for
you
judiciously.
When
women
are
sensible,
and,
above
all,
intelligible,
I
can
get
on
with
them.
It
is
only
the
vague,
superfine
sensations,
and
extremely
wire
drawn
notions,
that
put
me
about.
Let
a
woman
ask
me
to
give
her
an
edible
or
a
wearable
be
the
same
a
roc's
egg
or
the
breastplate
of
Aaron,
a
share
of
St.
John's
locusts
and
honey
or
the
leathern
girdle
about
his
loins
I
can,
at
least,
understand
the
demand;
but
when
they
pine
for
they
know
not
what
sympathy,
sentiment,
some
of
these
indefinite
abstractions
I
can't
do
it;
I
don't
know
it;
I
haven't
got
it.
Madam,
accept
my
arm."
Mrs.
Pryor
signified
that
she
should
stay
with
her
daughter
