not
bear
it,
and
his
children
after
him
never
could.
The
want
of
general
benevolence
made
him
very
impatient
of
imbecility,
and
of
all
faults
which
grated
on
his
strong,
shrewd
nature;
it
left
no
check
to
his
cutting
sarcasm.
As
he
was
not
merciful,
he
would
sometimes
wound
and
wound
again,
without
noticing
how
much
he
hurt,
or
caring
how
deep
he
thrust.
As
to
the
paucity
of
ideality
in
his
mind,
that
can
scarcely
be
called
a
fault:
a
fine
ear
for
music,
a
correct
eye
for
colour
and
form,
left
him
the
quality
of
taste;
and
who
cares
for
imagination?
Who
does
not
think
it
a
rather
dangerous,
senseless
attribute,
akin
to
weakness,
perhaps
partaking
of
frenzy
a
disease
rather
than
a
gift
of
the
mind?
Probably
all
think
it
so
but
those
who
possess,
or
fancy
they
possess,
it.
To
hear
them
speak,
you
would
believe
that
their
hearts
would
be
cold
if
that
elixir
did
not
flow
about
them,
that
their
eyes
would
be
dim
if
that
flame
did
not
refine
their
vision,
that
they
would
be
lonely
if
this
strange
companion
abandoned
them.
You
would
suppose
that
it
imparted
some
glad
hope
to
spring,
