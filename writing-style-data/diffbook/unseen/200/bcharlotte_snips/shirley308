a
steel
ball
soldered
in
her
head;
and
when,
while
looking,
she
began
to
talk
in
an
indescribably
dry,
monotonous
tone
a
tone
without
vibration
or
inflection
you
felt
as
if
a
graven
image
of
some
bad
spirit
were
addressing
you.
But
it
was
all
a
figment
of
fancy,
a
matter
of
surface.
Miss
Mann's
goblin
grimness
scarcely
went
deeper
than
the
angel
sweetness
of
hundreds
of
beauties.
She
was
a
perfectly
honest,
conscientious
woman,
who
had
performed
duties
in
her
day
from
whose
severe
anguish
many
a
human
Peri,
gazelle

rigid
self

made
large
sacrifices
of
time,
money,
health
for
those
who
had
repaid
her
only
by
ingratitude,
and
now
her
main
almost
her
sole
fault
was
that
she
was
censorious.
Censorious
she
certainly
was.
Caroline
had
not
sat
five
minutes
ere
her
hostess,
still
keeping
her
under
the
spell
of
that
dread
and
Gorgon
gaze,
began
flaying
alive
certain
of
the
families
in
the
neighbourhood.
She
went
to
work
at
this
business
in
a
singularly
cool,
deliberate
manner,

surgeon
practising
with
his
scalpel
on
