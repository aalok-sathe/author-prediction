in
a
decent
English
parish,
bring
disgrace
on
those
who
indulge
in
them,
and,
what
is
far
worse,
on
the
sacred
institution
of
which
they
are
merely
the
humble
appendages."
There
was
a
certain
dignity
in
the
little
elderly
gentleman's
manner
of
rebuking
these
youths,
though
it
was
not,
perhaps,
quite
the
dignity
most
appropriate
to
the
occasion.
Mr.
Helstone,
standing
straight
as
a
ramrod,
looking
keen
as
a
kite,
presented,
despite
his
clerical
hat,
black
coat,
and
gaiters,
more
the
air
of
a
veteran
officer
chiding
his
subalterns
than
of
a
venerable
priest
exhorting
his
sons
in
the
faith.
Gospel
mildness,
apostolic
benignity,
never
seemed
to
have
breathed
their
influence
over
that
keen
brown
visage,
but
firmness
had
fixed
the
features,
and
sagacity
had
carved
her
own
lines
about
them.
"I
met
Supplehough,"
he
continued,
"plodding
through
the
mud
this
wet
night,
going
to
preach
at
Milldean
opposition
shop.
As
I
told
you,
I
heard
Barraclough
bellowing
in
the
midst
of
a
conventicle
like
a
possessed
bull;
and
I
find
you,
gentlemen,
tarrying
over
your
half
pint
of
muddy
port
wine,
and
scolding
like
angry
old
women.
No
wonder
Supplehough
should
have
dipped
sixteen
adult
converts
in
a
day
