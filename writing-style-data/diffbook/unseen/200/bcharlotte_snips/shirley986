girls,
would
be
better
at
home;
and
her
decision
that,
instead
of
going
to
church,
they
should
sit
silent
for
two
hours
in
the
back
parlour,
while
Rose
and
Martin
alternately
read
a
succession
of
sermons
John
Wesley's
"Sermons."
John
Wesley,
being
a
reformer
and
an
agitator,

up
from
the
book
which,
