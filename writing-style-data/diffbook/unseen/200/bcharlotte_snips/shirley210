If
I
could
guide
that
benignant
heart,
I
believe
I
should
counsel
it
to
exclude
one
who
does
not
profess
to
have
any
higher
aim
in
life
than
that
of
patching
up
his
broken
fortune,
and
wiping
clean
from
his
bourgeois
scutcheon
the
foul
stain

this
morning,
did

not?"
"What
made
you
think
so?"
"Your
look
your
manner."
"But
look
at
me
now

"Oh!

"Yet
I
am

same,
except
that
I
