were
soon
in
the
midst
of
the
company.
The
former
met
them
very
easily
for
her.
Instead
of
sitting
down
in
a
retired
corner,
or
stealing
away
to
her
own
room
till
the
procession
should
be
marshalled,
according
to
her
wont,
she
moved
through
the
three
parlours,
conversed
and
smiled,
absolutely
spoke
once
or
twice
ere
she
was
spoken
to,
and,
in
short,
seemed
a
new
creature.
It
was
Shirley's
presence
which
thus
transformed
her;
the
view
of
Miss
Keeldar's
air
and
manner
did
her
a
world
of
good.
Shirley
had
no
fear
of
her
kind,
no
tendency
to
shrink
from,
to
avoid
it.
All
human
beings
men,
women,
or
children
whom
low
breeding
or
coarse
presumption
did
not
render
positively
offensive,
were
welcome
enough
to
her
some
much
more
so
than
others,
of
course;
but,
generally
speaking,
till
a
man
had
indisputably
proved
himself
bad
and
a
nuisance,
Shirley
was
willing
to
think
him
good
and
an
acquisition,
and
to
treat
him
accordingly.
This
disposition
made
her
a
general
favourite,
for
it
robbed
her
very
raillery
of
its
sting,
and
gave
her
serious
or
smiling
conversation
a
happy
charm;
nor
did
it
diminish
the
value
of
her
intimate
friendship,
