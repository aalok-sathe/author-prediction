Caroline,
to
whom
the
importance
of
the
emergency
gave
a
certain
energy,
"Fanny
must
run
down
to
Briarfield
and
buy
some
muffins
and
crumpets
and
some
biscuits.
And
don't
be
cross,
Eliza;
we
can't
help
it
now."
"And
which
tea
things
are
we
to
have?"
"Oh,

the
drawing
room.
"Still,"
she
thought,
as
she
paused
at
the
door
ere
opening
it,
"if
Robert
would
but
come
even
now
how
bright
all
would
be!
How
comparatively
easy
the
task
of
amusing
these
people
if
he
were
present!
There
would
be
an
interest
in
hearing
him
talk
(though
he
never
says
much
in
company)
and
in
talking

There
can
be
no
interest
in
hearing

or

them.
