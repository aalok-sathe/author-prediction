my
abundance,
give
abundantly;
and
that
the
donation
may
go
farther,
let
it
be
made
wisely.
To
that
intent,
we
must
introduce
some
clear,
calm,
practical
sense
into
our
councils.
So
go
and
fetch
Miss
Ainley."
Without
another
word
Caroline
put
on
her
bonnet
and
departed.
It
may,
perhaps,
appear
strange
that
neither
she
nor
Shirley
thought
of
consulting
Mrs.
Pryor
on
their
scheme;
but
they
were
wise
in
abstaining.
To
have
consulted
her
and
this
they
knew
by
instinct
would
only
have
been
to
involve
her
in
painful
embarrassment.
She
was
far
better
informed,
better
read,
a
deeper
thinker
than
Miss
Ainley,
but
of
administrative
energy,
of
executive
activity,
she
had
none.
She
would
subscribe
her
own
modest
mite
to
a
charitable
object
willingly
secret
almsgiving
suited
her;
but
in
public
plans,
on
a
large
scale,
she
could
take
no
part;
as
to
originating
them,
that
was
out
of
the
question.
This
Shirley
knew,
and
therefore
she
did
not
trouble
Mrs.
Pryor
by
unavailing
conferences,
which
could
only
remind
her
of
her
own
deficiencies,
and
do
no
good.
It
was
a
bright
day
for
Miss
Ainley
when
she
was
summoned
to
Fieldhead
to
deliberate
on
projects
so
congenial
to
