This
gentleman
turned
out
admirably
far
better
than
either
you
or
I
could
possibly
have
expected,
reader.
He,
too,
married
a
most
sensible,
quiet,
lady
like
little
woman.
The
match
was
the
making
of
him.
He
became
an
exemplary
domestic
character,
and
a
truly
active
parish
priest
(as
a
pastor
he,
to
his
dying
day,
conscientiously
refused
to
act).
The
outside
of
the
cup
and
platter
he
burnished
up
with
the
best
polishing
powder;
the
furniture
of
the
altar
and
temple
he
looked
after
with
the
zeal
of
an
upholsterer,
the
care
of
a
cabinet
maker.
His
little
school,
his
little
church,
his
little
parsonage,
all
owed
their
erection
to
him;
and
they
did
him
credit.
Each
was
a
model
in
its
way.
If
uniformity
and
taste
in
architecture
had
been
the
same
thing
as
consistency
and
earnestness
in
religion,
what
a
shepherd
of
a
Christian
flock
Mr.
Donne
would
have
made!
There
was
one
art
in
the
mastery
of
which
nothing
mortal
ever
surpassed
Mr.
Donne:
it
was
that
of
begging.
By
his
own
unassisted
efforts
he
begged
all
the
money
for
all
his
erections.
In
this
matter
he
had
a
grasp
of
plan,
a
scope
of
action
quite
