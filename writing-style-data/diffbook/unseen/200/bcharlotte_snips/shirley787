at
this
moment.
She
appeared
unconscious
of
the
humility
of
her
present
position;
or
if
conscious,
it
was
only
to
taste
a
charm
in
its
lowliness.
It
did
not
revolt
her
pride
that
the
group
to
whom
she
voluntarily
officiated
as
handmaid
should
include
her
cousin's
tutor.
It
did
not
scare
her
that
while
she
handed
the
bread
and
milk
to
the
rest,
she
had
to
offer
it
to
him
also;
and
Moore
took
his
portion
from
her
hand
as
calmly
as
if
he
had
been
her
equal.
"You
are
overheated
now,"
he
said,
when
she
had
retained
the
fork
for
some
time;
"let
me
relieve
you."
And
he
took
it
from
her
with
a
sort
of
quiet
authority,
to
which
she
submitted
passively,
neither
resisting
him
nor
thanking
him.
"I
should
like
to
see
your
pictures,
Louis,"
said
Caroline,
when
the
sumptuous
luncheon
was
discussed.
"Would
not
you,
Mr.
Hall?"
"To
please
you,
I
should;
but,
for
my
own
part,
I
have
cut
him
as
an
artist.
I
had
enough
of
him
in
that
capacity
in
Cumberland
and
Westmoreland.
Many
a
wetting
we
got
amongst
the
mountains
because
he
would
persist
in
sitting
on
a
camp
stool,
catching
effects
