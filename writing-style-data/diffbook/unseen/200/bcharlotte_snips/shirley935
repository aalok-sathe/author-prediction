till
my
blood
is
up;
you
have
worried
me
till
I
turn
again."
"That
Moore
is
the
brother
of
my
son's
tutor.
Would
you
let
the
usher
call
you
sister?"
Bright
and
broad
shone
Shirley's
eye
as
she
fixed
it
on
her
questioner
now.
"No,
no;
not
for
a
province
of
possession,
not
for
a
century
of
life."
"You
cannot
separate
the
husband
from
his
family."
"What
then?"
"Mr.
Louis
Moore's
sister
you
will
be."
"Mr.
Sympson,
I
am
sick
at
heart
with
all
this
weak
trash;
I
will
bear
no
more.
Your
thoughts
are
not
my
thoughts,
your
aims
are
not
my
aims,
your
gods
are
not
my
gods.
We
do
not
view
things
in
the
same
light;
we
do
not
measure
them
by
the
same
standard;
we
hardly
speak
in
the
same
tongue.
Let
us
part."
"It
is
not,"
she
resumed,
much
excited
"it
is
not
that
I
hate
you;
you
are
a
good
sort
of
man.
Perhaps
you
mean
well
in
your
way.
But
we
cannot
suit;
we
are
ever
at
variance.
You
annoy
me
with
small
meddling,
with
petty
tyranny;
you
exasperate
my
temper,
and
make
and
keep
me
passionate.
As
to
your
small
maxims,
your
