seen
their
eyes
meet
once
only
once.
Some
natures
would
have
taken
pleasure
in
the
glance
then
surprised,
because
there
was
no
harm
and
some
delight
in
it.
It
was
by
no
means
a
glance
of
mutual
intelligence,
for
mutual
love
secrets
existed
not
between
them.
There
was
nothing
then
of
craft
and
concealment
to
offend:
only
Mr.
Moore's
eyes,
looking
into
Caroline's,
felt
they
were
clear
and
gentle;
and
Caroline's
eyes,
encountering
Mr.
Moore's,
confessed
they
were
manly
and
searching.
Each
acknowledged
the
charm
in
his
or
her

Moore
smiled
slightly,
and
Caroline
coloured
as

Mr.
Helstone
could,
on
the
spot,
have
rated
them

They
annoyed
him.
Why?
Impossible
to
say.
If
you
had
asked
him
what
Moore
merited
at
that
moment,
he
would
have
said
a
"horsewhip;"
if
you
had
inquired
into
Caroline's
deserts,
he
would
have
adjudged
her
a
box
on
the
ear;
if
you
had
further
demanded
the
reason
of
such
chastisements,
he
would
have
stormed
against
flirtation
and
love
making,
and
vowed
he
would
have
no
such
folly
going
on
under
his
roof.
These
private
considerations,
combined
with
political
reasons,
fixed
his
resolution
of
separating
the
cousins.
He
