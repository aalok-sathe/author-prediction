Jessy.
Jessy,
however,
was
destined
to
possess,
along
with
sprightly
intelligence
and
vivacious
feeling,
the
gift
of
fascination,
the
power
to
charm
when,
where,
and
whom
she
would.
Rose
was
to
have
a
fine,
generous
soul,
a
noble
intellect
profoundly
cultivated,
a
heart
as
true
as
steel,
but
the
manner
to
attract
was
not
to
be
hers.
"Now,
Rose,
tell
me
the
name
of
this
lady
who
denied
that
I
was
sentimental,"
urged
Mr.
Moore.
Rose
had
no
idea
of
tantalization,
or
she
would
have
held
him
a

She
answered

me.
What
was
she
like?
Where
did
you
see
her?"
"When
Jessy
and
I
went
to
spend
the
day
at
Whinbury
with
Kate
and
Susan
Pearson,
who
were
just
come
home
from
school,
there
was
a
party
at
Mrs.
Pearson's,
and
some
grown
up
ladies
were
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
drawing
room
talking
about
you."
"Did
you
know
none
of
them?"
"Hannah,
and
Harriet,
and
Dora,
and
Mary
Sykes."
"Good.
Were
they
abusing
me,
Rosy?"
"Some
of
them
were.
They
called
you
a
misanthrope.
I
remember
the
word.
I
looked
for
it
in
the
