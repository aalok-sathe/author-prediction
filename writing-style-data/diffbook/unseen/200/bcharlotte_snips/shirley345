Fieldhead
will
be
esteemed
a
favour."
"You
speak
my
sentiments
precisely,
ma'am,"
said
Shirley,
"and
I
thank
you
for
anticipating
me.
Let
me
tell
you,"
she
continued,
turning
again
to
Caroline,
"that
you
also
ought
to
thank
my
governess.
It
is
not
every
one
she
would
welcome
as
she
has
welcomed
you.
You
are
distinguished
more
than
you
think.
This
morning,
as
soon
as
you
are
gone,
I
shall
ask
Mrs.
Pryor's
opinion
of
you.
I
am
apt
to
rely
on
her
judgment
of
character,
for
hitherto
I
have
found
it
wondrous
accurate.
Already
I
foresee
a
favourable
answer
to
my
inquiries.
Do
I
not
guess
rightly,
Mrs.
Pryor?"
"My
dear,
you
said
but
now
you
would
ask
my
opinion
when
Miss
Helstone
was
gone.
I
am
scarcely
likely
to
give
it
in
her
presence."
"No;
and
perhaps
it
will
be
long
enough
before
I
obtain
it.
I
am
sometimes
sadly
tantalized,
Mr.
Helstone,
by
Mrs.
Pryor's
extreme
caution.
Her
judgments
ought
to
be
correct
when
they
come,
for
they
are
often
as
tardy
of
delivery
as
a
Lord
Chancellor's.
On
some
people's
characters
I
cannot
get
her
to
pronounce
a
sentence,
entreat
as
I
may."
Mrs.
Pryor
here
smiled.
