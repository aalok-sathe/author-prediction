me,
William?"
"I
almost
was,
in
a
way.
But
I
forgave
ye
varry
soon.
Ye
meant
well.
Ay,
I
am
proud,
and
so
are
ye;
but
your
pride
and
mine
is
t'
raight
mak
what
we
call
i'
Yorkshire
clean
pride
such
as
Mr.
Malone
and
Mr.
Donne
knows
nought
about.
Theirs
is
mucky
pride.
Now,
I
shall
teach
my
lasses
to

as
proud

lads
to
be
as
proud

myseln;

curates.

talking.

Malone
and
Mr.
Donne
is
almost
too
proud
to
do
aught
for
theirseln;
we
are
almost
too
proud
to
let
anybody
do
aught
for
us.
T'
curates
can
hardly
bide
to
speak
a
civil
word
to
them
they
think
beneath
them;
we
can
hardly
bide
to
tak
an
uncivil
word
fro'
them
that
thinks
themseln
aboon
us."
"Now,
William,
be
humble
enough
to
tell
me
truly
how
you
are
getting
on
in
the
world.
