with
both
her
ears,
could
not
understand.
It
was
very
brief.
A
cry
broke
it
a
sound
of
surprise,
followed
by
the
sound
of
a
kiss;
ejaculations,
but
half
articulate,
succeeded.
"Mon
Dieu!
mon
Dieu!
Est
ce
que
je
m'y
attendais?"
were
the
words

"Et

"Caroline!

called
Hortense,
a
moment
afterwards,
"venez

"Strange,"
commented
Miss
Helstone,
"passing
strange!
What
does
this
unwonted
excitement
about
such
an
every

She
has
not
lost
her
senses,
