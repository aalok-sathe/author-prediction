only
come,
I
can
teach
her
to
the
contrary.
I
would
rather
she
were
a
little
perverse;
it
will
steel
me.
I
prefer
her
cuirassed
in
pride,
armed
with
a
taunt.
Her
scorn
startles
me
from
my
dreams;
I
stand
up
myself.
A
sarcasm
from
her
eyes
or
lips
puts
strength

The
message,

That

her
at
once
in
solemn
accents,
and
with
rigid
mien.
Perhaps
he
would,
had
she
looked
saucy;
but
her
air
never
showed
less
of
cranerie.
A
soft
kind
of
youthful
shyness
depressed
her
eyelid
and
mantled

her
cheek.
The
tutor
stood
silent.
She
made
a
full
