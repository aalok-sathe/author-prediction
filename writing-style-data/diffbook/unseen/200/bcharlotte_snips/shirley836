lingered
on
the
countenance,
in
the
manner
of
Miss
Keeldar.
A
strange
quietude
settled
over
her
look,
her
movements,
her
very
voice.
The
alteration
was
not
so
marked
as
to
court
or
permit
frequent
questioning,
yet
it
was
there,
and
it
would
not
pass
away.
It
hung
over
her
like
a
cloud
which
no
breeze
could
stir
or
disperse.
Soon
it
became
evident
that
to
notice
this
change
was
to
annoy
her.
First
she
shrank
from
remark;
and,
if
persisted
in,
she,
with
her
own
peculiar
hauteur,
repelled
it.
"Was
she
ill?"
The
reply
came
with
decision.
"I
am
not."
"Did
anything
weigh
on
her
mind?
Had
anything
happened
to
affect
her
spirits?"
She
scornfully
ridiculed
the
idea.
"What
did
they
mean
by
spirits?
She
had
no
spirits,
black
or
white,
blue
or
gray,
to
affect."
"Something
must
be
the
matter
she
was
so
altered."
"She
supposed
she
had
a
right
to
alter
at
her
ease.
She
knew
she
was
plainer.
If
it
suited
her
to
grow
ugly,
why
need
others
fret
themselves
on
the
subject?"
"There
must
be
a
cause
for
the
change.
What
was
it?"
She
peremptorily
requested
to
be
let
alone.
Then
she
would
make
every
effort
