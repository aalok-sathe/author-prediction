walked
once
a
day
past
the
house,
just
for
the
satisfaction
of
looking
up
at
your
window,
which
I
could
distinguish
by
the
drawn
curtains.
I
really
dared
not
come
in."
"I
have
wished
for
you,
Caroline."
"I
did
not
know
that;
I
never
dreamt
one
instant
that
you
thought
of
me.
If
I
had
but
most
distantly
imagined
such
a
possibility
"
"Mrs.
Yorke
would
still
have
beaten
you."
"She
would
not.
Stratagem
should
have
been
tried,
if
persuasion
failed.
I
would
have
come
to
the
kitchen
door;
the
servants
should
have
let
me
in,
and
I
would
have
walked
straight
upstairs.
In
fact,
it
was
far
more
the
fear
of
intrusion
the
fear
of
yourself
that
baffled
me
than
the
fear
of
Mrs.
Yorke."
"Only
last
night
I
despaired
of
ever
seeing
you
again.
Weakness
has
wrought
terrible
depression
in
me
terrible
depression."
"And
you
sit
alone?"
"Worse
than
alone."
"But
you
must
be
getting
better,
since
you
can
leave
your
bed?"
"I
doubt
whether
I
shall
live.
I
see
nothing
for
it,
after
such
exhaustion,
but
decline."
"You
you
shall
go
home
to
the
Hollow."
"Dreariness
would
accompany,
nothing
cheerful
come
near
me."
"I
will
alter
this.
