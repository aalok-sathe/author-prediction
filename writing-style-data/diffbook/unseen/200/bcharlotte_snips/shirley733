what
you
were
like,
I
could
have
dropped."
"Mamma,
why?"
"I
trembled
in
your
presence.
I
said,
I
will
never
own
her;
she
shall
never
know
me."
"But
I
said
and
did
nothing
remarkable.
I
felt
a
little
diffident
at
the
thought
of
an
introduction
to
strangers
that
was
all."
"I
soon
saw
you
were
diffident.
That
was
the
first
thing
which
reassured
me.
Had
you
been
rustic,
clownish,
awkward,
I
should
have
been
content."
"You
puzzle
me."
"I
had
reason
to
dread
a
fair
outside,
to
mistrust
a
popular
bearing,
to
shudder
before
distinction,
grace,
and
courtesy.
Beauty
and
affability
had
come
in
my
way
when
I
was
recluse,
desolate,
young,
and
ignorant
a
toil
worn
governess
perishing
of
uncheered
labour,
breaking
down
before
her
time.
These,
Caroline,
when
they
smiled
on
me,
I
mistook
for
angels.
I
followed
them
home;
and
when
into
their
hands
I
had
given
without
reserve
my
whole
chance
of
future
happiness,
it
was
my
lot
to
witness
a
transfiguration
on
the
domestic
hearth
to
see
the
white
mask
lifted,
the
bright
disguise
put
away,
and
opposite
me
sat
down
O
God,
I
have
suffered!"
She
sank
on
the
pillow.
"I
have
suffered!
None
