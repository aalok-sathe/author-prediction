had
been
for
some
time
nodding
over
her
knitting;
fallen
into
a
doze
now,
she
made
no
response
to
the
remark.
"You
would
have
no
objection
to
come
here
oftener
of
an
evening?"
inquired
Robert,
as
he
took
her
folded
mantle
from
the
side
table,
where
it
still
lay,
and
carefully
wrapped
it
round
her.
"I
like
to
come
here;
but
I
have
no
desire
to
be
intrusive.
I
am
not
hinting
to
be
asked;
you
must
understand
that."
"Oh!
I
understand
thee,
child.
You
sometimes
lecture
me
for
wishing
to
be
rich,
Lina;
but
if
I
were
rich,
you
should
live
here
always
at
any
rate,
you
should
live
with
me
wherever
my
habitation
might
be."
"That
would
be
pleasant;
and
if
you
were
poor
ever
so
poor
it
would
still
be
pleasant.
Good
night,
Robert."
"I
promised
to
walk
with
you
up
to
the
rectory."
"I
know
you
did;
but
I
thought
you
had
forgotten,
and
I
hardly
knew
how
to
remind
you,
though
I
wished
to
do
it.
But
would
you
like
to
go?
It
is
a
cold
night,
and
as
Fanny
is
come,
there
is
no
necessity
"
"Here
is
your
muff;
don't
wake
Hortense
come."
