a
Yorkshire
girl
too?"
"I
am
Yorkshire
in
blood
and
birth.
Five
generations
of
my
race
sleep
under
the
aisles
of
Briarfield
Church.
I
drew
my
first
breath
in
the
old
black
hall
behind
us."
Hereupon
Caroline
presented
her
hand,
which
was
accordingly
taken
and
shaken.
"We
are
compatriots,"
said
she.
"Yes,"

Shirley,
with

leaves
are
never
quite
hushed,
and
in
high
wind
a
flood
rushes,
a
sea
thunders
above
you."
"Was
it
not
one
of
Robin
Hood's
haunts?"
"Yes,
and
there
are
mementos
of
him
still
existing.
To
penetrate
into
Nunnwood,
Miss
Keeldar,
is
to
go

back
into

"Yes,
