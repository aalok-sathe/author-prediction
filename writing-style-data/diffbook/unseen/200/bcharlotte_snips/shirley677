flourishing
in
puffs
and
bows
about
the
head,
was
of
the
sort
called
love
ribbon.
There
was
a
good
deal
of
it,
I
may
say,
a
very
great
deal.
Mrs.
Yorke
wore
the
cap
it
became
her;
she
wore
the
gown
also
it
suited
her
no
less.
That
great
lady
was
come
in
a
friendly
way
to
take
tea
with
Miss
Moore.
It
was
almost
as
great
and
as
rare
a
favour
as
if
the
queen
were
to
go
uninvited
to
share
pot
luck
with
one
of
her
subjects.
A
higher
mark
of
distinction
she
could
not
show
she
who
in
general
scorned
visiting
and
tea
drinking,
and
held
cheap
and
stigmatized
as
"gossips"
every
maid
and
matron
of
the
vicinage.
There
was
no
mistake,
however;
Miss
Moore
was
a
favourite
with
her.
She
had
evinced
the
fact
more
than
once
evinced
it
by
stopping
to
speak
to
her
in
the
churchyard
on
Sundays;
by
inviting
her,
almost
hospitably,
to
come
to
Briarmains;
evinced
it
to
day
by
the
grand
condescension
of
a
personal
visit.
Her
reasons
for
the
preference,
as
assigned
by
herself,
were
that
Miss
Moore
was
a
woman
of
steady
deportment,
without
the
least
levity
of
conversation
