Of
late
years
an
abundant
shower
of
curates
has
fallen
upon
the
north
of
England:
they
lie
very
thick
on
the
hills;
every
parish
has
one
or
more
of
them;
they
are
young
enough
to
be
very
active,
and
ought
to
be
doing
a
great
deal
of
good.
But
not
of
late
years
are
we
about
to
speak;
we
are
going
back
to
the
beginning
of
this
century:
late
years
present
years
are
dusty,
sunburnt,
hot,
arid;
we
will
evade
the
noon,
forget
it
in
siesta,
pass
the
midday
in
slumber,
and
dream
of
dawn.
If
you
think,
from
this
prelude,
that
anything
like
a
romance
is
preparing
for
you,
reader,
you
never
were
more
mistaken.
Do
you
anticipate
sentiment,
and
poetry,
and
reverie?
Do
you
expect
passion,
and
stimulus,
and
melodrama?
Calm
your
expectations;
reduce
them
to
a
lowly
standard.
Something
real,
cool,
and
solid
lies
before
you;
something
unromantic
as
Monday
morning,
when
all
who
have
work
wake
with
the
consciousness
that
they
must
rise
and
betake
themselves
thereto.
It
is
not
positively
affirmed
that
you
shall
not
have
a
taste
of
the
exciting,
perhaps
towards
the
middle
and
close
of
the
meal,
but
it
is
resolved
that
