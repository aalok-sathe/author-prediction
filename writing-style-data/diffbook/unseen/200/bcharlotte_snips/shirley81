was
ordinary:
a
racy,
rough
character,
high
or
low,
ever
found
acceptance
with
him;
a
refined,
insipid
personage,
however
exalted
in
station,
was
his
aversion.
He
would
spend
an
hour
any
time
in
talking
freely
with
a
shrewd
workman
of
his
own,
or
with
some
queer,
sagacious
old
woman
amongst
his
cottagers,
when
he
would
have
grudged
a
moment
to
a
commonplace
fine
gentleman
or
to
the
most
fashionable
and
elegant,
if
frivolous,
lady.
His
preferences
on
these
points
he
carried
to
an
extreme,
forgetting
that
there
may
be
amiable
and
even
admirable
characters
amongst
those
who
cannot
be
original.
Yet
he
made
exceptions
to
his
own
rule.
There
was
a
certain
order
of
mind,
plain,
ingenuous,
neglecting
refinement,
almost
devoid
of
intellectuality,
and
quite
incapable
of
appreciating
what
was
intellectual
in
him,
but
which,
at
the
same
time,
never
felt
disgust
at
his
rudeness,
was
not
easily
wounded
by
his
sarcasm,
did
not
closely
analyze
his
sayings,
doings,
or
opinions,
with
which
he
was
peculiarly
at
ease,
and,
consequently,
which
he
peculiarly
preferred.
He
was
lord
amongst
such
characters.
They,
while
submitting
implicitly
to
his
influence,
never
acknowledged,
because
they
never
reflected
on,
his
superiority;
they
were
quite
tractable,
