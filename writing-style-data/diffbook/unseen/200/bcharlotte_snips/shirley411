Highlands.
We
will,
if
you
can
bear
a
sea
voyage,
go
to
the
Isles
the
Hebrides,
the
Shetland,
the
Orkney
Islands.
Would
you
not
like
that?
I
see
you
would.
Mrs.
Pryor,
I
call
you
to
witness.
Her
face
is
all
sunshine
at
the
bare
mention
of
it."
"I
should
like
it
much,"
returned
Caroline,
to
whom,
indeed,
the
notion
of
such
a
tour
was
not
only
pleasant,
but
gloriously
reviving.
Shirley
rubbed
her
hands.
"Come;
I
can
bestow
a

me
speak
respectfully
of
both,
though,
for
I
adore
them),
but,

may
be,
health
to
the
drooping,
strength
to
the
weak,
consolation
to
the
sad.
I
was
determined
to
make
something
of
it
better
than
a
fine
old
house
to
live
in,
than
satin
gowns
to
wear,
better
than
deference
from
acquaintance
and
homage
from
the
poor.
Here
is
to
begin.
This
summer,
Caroline,
Mrs.
Pryor
and
I
go
out
into
the
North
Atlantic,
beyond
the
Shetland,
perhaps
to
the
Faroe
Isles.
We
will
see
seals
in
Suderoe,
and,
