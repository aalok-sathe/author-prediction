the
time
I
was
three
and
twenty
being
then
a
tourist
in
France
and
Italy,
and
the
Lord
knows
where
I
curled
my
hair
every
night
before
I
went
to
bed,
and
wore
a
ring
i'
my
ear,
and
would
have
worn
one
i'
my
nose
if
it
had
been
the
fashion,
and
all
that
I
might
make
myself
pleasing
and
charming
to
the
ladies.
Martin
will
do
the
like."
"Will
I?
Never!
I've
more
sense.
What
a
guy
you
were,
father!
As
to
dressing,
I
make
this
vow:
I'll
never
dress
more
finely
than
as
you
see
me
at
present.
Mr.
Moore,
I'm
clad
in
blue
cloth
from
top
to
toe,
and
they
laugh
at
me,
and
call
me
sailor
at
the
grammar
school.
I
laugh
louder
at
them,
and
say
they
are
all
magpies
and
parrots,
with
their
coats
one
colour,
and
their
waistcoats
another,
and
their
trousers
a
third.
I'll
always
wear
blue
cloth,
and
nothing
but
blue
cloth.
It
is
beneath
a
human
being's
dignity
to
dress
himself
in
parti
coloured
garments."
"Ten
years
hence,
Martin,
no
tailor's
shop
will
have
choice
of
colours
varied
enough
for
thy
exacting
taste;
no
perfumer's
stores
essences
exquisite
enough
