of
a
summer
house.
The
vicar
stood
near
her,
leaning
on
his
cane.
Shirley,
who
could
not
be
inhospitable,
now
called
out
the
neglected
pair
in
the
oak
parlour.
She
convoyed
Donne
past
his
dread
enemy
Tartar,
who,
with
his
nose
on
his
fore

smart,
sensible
little
man,
as
he
was,
putting
it
gallantly
