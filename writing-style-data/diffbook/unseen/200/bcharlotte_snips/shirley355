of
deep
heath,
and
nothing
had
they
seen
but
wild
sheep,
nothing
heard
but
the
cries
of
wild
birds.
"I
know
how
the
heath
would
look
on
such
a
day,"
said
Caroline;
"purple
black
a
deeper
shade
of
the
sky
tint,
and
that
would
be
livid."
"Yes,
quite
livid,
with
brassy
edges
to
the
clouds,
and
here
and
there

white
gleam,
more
ghastly
than
the

the
rain
fell
in
whitening
sheets,
suddenly
they
were
blotted
from
the
prospect;
they
were
washed
from
the
world."
"I
have
seen
such
storms
in
hilly
districts
in
Yorkshire;
and
at
their
riotous
climax,
while
the
sky
was
all
