in
the
same
county
and
parish
as
yourself.
Truthful,
upright,
independent
you
are,
as
a
rock
based
below
seas;
but
also
you
are
harsh,
rude,
narrow,
and
merciless."
"Not
to
the
poor,
lass,
nor
to
the
meek
of
the
earth;
only
to
the
proud
and
high
minded."
"And
what
right
have
you,
sir,
to
make
such
distinctions?
A
prouder,
a
higher
minded
man
than

can
love
their
whole

who
can
forgive
others
for
being
richer,
more
prosperous,
or
more
powerful
than
they
are.
Such
men
may
have
less
originality,
less
force
of
character
than
you,
but
they
are
better
friends
to
mankind."
"And

Mr.

"When
