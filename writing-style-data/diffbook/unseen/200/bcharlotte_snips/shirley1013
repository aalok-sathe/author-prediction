I
imagine
her
jealous
of
compromising
her
pride,
of
relinquishing
her
power,
of
sharing
her
property."
"Shirley
has
hurt
your
amour
propre."
"She
did
hurt
it;
though
I
had
not
an
emotion
of
tenderness,
nor
a
spark
of
passion
for
her."
"Then,
Robert,
it
was
very
wicked
in
you
to
want
to

Caroline,
what

"But
not
perfect.
He
made
