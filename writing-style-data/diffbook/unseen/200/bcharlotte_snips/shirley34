give
Sykes
or
Pearson
a
call
in
their
counting
house,
where
our
discussions
run
on
other
topics
than
matrimony,
and
our
thoughts
are
occupied
with
other
things
than
courtships,
establishments,
dowries.
The
cloth
we
can't
sell,
the
hands
we
can't
employ,
the
mills
we
can't
run,
the
perverse
course
of
events
generally,
which
we
cannot
alter,
fill
our
hearts,
I
take
it,
pretty
well
at
present,
to
the
tolerably
complete
exclusion
of
such
figments
as
love
making,
etc."
"I
go
along
with
you
completely,
Moore.
If
there
is
one
notion
I
hate
more
than
another,
it
is
that
of
marriage
I
mean
marriage
in
the
vulgar
weak
sense,
as
a
mere
matter
of
sentiment
two
beggarly
fools
agreeing
to
unite
their
indigence
by
some
fantastic
tie
of
feeling.
Humbug!
But
an
advantageous
connection,
such
as
can
be
formed
in
consonance
with
dignity
of
views
and
permanency
of
solid
interests,
is
not
so
bad
eh?"
"No,"
responded
Moore,
in
an
absent
manner.
The
subject
seemed
to
have
no
interest
for
him;
he
did
not
pursue
it.
After
sitting
for
some
time
gazing
at
the
fire
with
a
preoccupied
air,
he
suddenly
turned
his
head.
"Hark!"
said
he.
"Did
you
hear
wheels?"
