a
grave
had
opened,
whence
issues
the
body
of
one
that
slept.
Ere
you
are
aware
you
stand
face
to
face
with
a
shrouded
and
unthought
of
calamity
a
new
Lazarus.
Caroline
Helstone
went
home
from
Hollow's
Cottage
in
good
health,
as
she
imagined.
On
waking
the
next
morning
she
felt
oppressed
with
unwonted
languor.
At
breakfast,
at
each
meal
of
the
following
day,
she
missed
all
sense
of
appetite.
Palatable
food
was
as
ashes
and
sawdust
to
her.
"Am
I
ill?"
she
asked,
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass.
Her
eyes
were
bright,
their
pupils
dilated,
her
cheeks
seemed
rosier,
and
fuller
than
usual.
"I
look
well;
why
can
I
not
eat?"
She
felt
a
pulse
beat
fast
in
her
temples;
she
felt,
too,
her
brain
in
strange
activity.
Her
spirits
were
raised;
hundreds
of
busy
and
broken
but
brilliant
thoughts
engaged
her
mind.
A
glow
rested
on
them,
such
as
tinged
her
complexion.
Now
followed
a
hot,
parched,
thirsty,
restless
night.
Towards
morning
one
terrible
dream
seized
her
like
a
tiger;
when
she
woke,
she
felt
and
knew
she
was
ill.
How
she
had
caught
the
fever
(fever
it
was)
she
could
not
tell.
Probably
in
