that
her
cousin
had
absolutely
no
sympathizing
friend
at
Fieldhead;
that
to
Miss
Keeldar
he
was
as
much
a
mere
teacher,
as
little
a
gentleman,
as
little
a
man,
as
to
the
estimable
Misses
Sympson.
What
had
befallen
the
kind
hearted
Shirley
that
she
should
be
so
indifferent
to
the
dreary
position
of
a
fellow
creature
thus
isolated
under
her
roof?
She
was
not,
perhaps,
haughty
to
him,
but
she
never
noticed
him
she
let
him
alone.
He
came
and
went,

recognized
his
existence.
As
to
Louis
Moore
himself,
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
used
to
this
life,
and
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
bear

him,
and
were
unmurmuring
in
their
captivity.
He
never
laughed;
he
seldom
smiled;
he
was
uncomplaining.
He
fulfilled
the
round
of
his
duties
scrupulously.
His
pupil
loved
him;
he
asked
nothing
more
than
civility
from
the
rest
of
the
world.
It
even
appeared
that
he
would
accept
nothing
more
in
that
abode
at
least;
for
when
his
cousin
Caroline
made
gentle
overtures
of
friendship,
he
did
not
encourage
them
he
rather
avoided
than
sought
