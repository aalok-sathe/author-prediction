Gerard's
share
in
the
business.
She
inherited,
as
we
have
seen,
but
his
share
in
the
liabilities
of
the
firm;
and
these
liabilities,
though
duly
set
aside
by
a
composition
with
creditors,
some
said
her
son
Robert
accepted,
in
his
turn,
as
a
legacy,
and
that
he
aspired
one
day
to
discharge
them,
and
to
rebuild
the
fallen
house
of
Gerard
and
Moore
on
a
scale
at
least
equal
to
its
former
greatness.
It
was
even
supposed
that
he
took
by
past
circumstances
much
to
heart;
and
if
a
childhood
passed
at
the
side
of
a
saturnine
mother,
under
foreboding
of
coming
evil,
and
a
manhood
drenched
and
blighted
by
the
pitiless
descent
of
the
storm,
could
painfully
impress
the
mind,
his
probably
was
impressed
in
no
golden
characters.
If,
however,
he
had
a
great
end
of
restoration
in
view,
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
employ
great
means
for
its
attainment.
He
was
obliged
to
be
content
with
the
day
of
small
things.
When
he
came
to
Yorkshire,
he
whose
ancestors
had
owned
warehouses
in
this
seaport,
and
factories
in
that
inland
town,
had
possessed
their
town
house
and
their
country
seat
saw
no
way
open
to
him
