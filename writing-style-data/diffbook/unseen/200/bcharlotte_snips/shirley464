inward

and
truly.
It
is
good
for
women,
especially,
to
be
endowed
with
a
soft
blindness;
to
have
mild,
dim
eyes,
that
never
penetrate
below
the
surface
of
things
that
take
all
for
what
it
seems.
Thousands,
knowing
this,
keep
their
eyelids
drooped
on
system;
but
the
most
downcast
glance
has
its
loophole,
through
which
it
can,
on

life.
I
remember
once
seeing
a
pair
of
blue
eyes,
that
were
usually
thought
sleepy,
secretly

The
world
called
the
owner
of
these
blue
eyes
bonne

I
learned
her
nature

it
off
by
heart
studied
it
in
its
farthest,
most
hidden
recesses.
She
was
the
finest,
deepest,
subtlest
schemer
in
Europe.
When
all
was
at
length
settled
to
Miss
Keeldar's
mind,
and
the
clergy
had
entered
so
fully
into
the

of
her
plans
as
