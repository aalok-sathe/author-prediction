the
couch,
which
had
been
but
a
thorny
one
to
her,
felt
that
revival
of
spirits
which
the
return
of
day,
of
action,
gives
to
all
but
the
wholly
despairing
or
actually
dying.
She
dressed
herself,
as
usual,
carefully,
trying
so
to
arrange
her
hair
and
attire
that
nothing
of
the
forlornness

We

little
conjectured
where

Men,
I
believe,
fancy
women's
minds

like
those
