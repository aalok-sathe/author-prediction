at
once
before
him
pallid,
lifeless,
helpless
this
was
the
very
combination
of
circumstances
to
win
for
the
victim
Mr.
Yorke's
liveliest
interest.
No
other
hand
was
there
to
raise
to
aid,
no
other
voice
to
question
kindly,
no
other
brain
to
concert
measures;
he
had
to
do
it
all
himself.
This
utter
dependence
of
the
speechless,
bleeding
youth
(as
a
youth
he
regarded
him)
on
his
benevolence
secured
that
benevolence
most
effectually.
Well
did
Mr.
Yorke
like
to
have
power,
and
to
use
it.
He
had
now
between
his
hands
power
over
a
fellow
creature's
life.
It
suited
him.
No
less
perfectly
did
it
suit
his
saturnine
better
half.
The
incident
was
quite
in
her
way
and
to
her
taste.
Some
women
would
have
been
terror
struck
to
see
a
gory
man
brought
in
over
their
threshold,
and
laid
down
in
their
hall
in
the
"howe
of
the
night."
There,
you
would
suppose,
was
subject
matter
for
hysterics.
No.
Mrs.
Yorke
went
into
hysterics
when
Jessie
would
not
leave
the
garden
to
come
to
her
knitting,
or
when
Martin
proposed
starting
for
Australia,
with
a
view
to
realize
freedom
and
escape
the
tyranny
of
Matthew;
but
an
attempted
murder
