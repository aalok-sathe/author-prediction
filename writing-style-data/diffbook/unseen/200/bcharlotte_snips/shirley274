"Ma
foi!
mon
ami,"
observed
Mr.
Moore
to
Yorke,
"ce
sont
vraiment
des
enfants
terribles,
que
les
votres!"
Rose,
who
had
been
listening
attentively
to
Mark's
speech,
replied
to
him,
"There
are
different
kinds
of
thoughts,
ideas,
and
notions,"
said
she,
"good
and
bad.
Sentimental
must
refer
to
the
bad,
or
Miss
Helstone
must
have
taken
it
in
that
sense,
for
she
was
not
blaming
Mr.
Moore;
she
was
defending
him."
"That's
my
kind
little
advocate!"
said
Moore,
taking
Rose's
hand.
"She
was
defending
him,"
repeated
Rose,
"as
I
should
have
done
had
I
been
in
her
place,
for
the
other
ladies
seemed
to
speak
spitefully."
"Ladies
always
do
speak
spitefully,"
observed
Martin.
"It
is
the
nature
of
womenites
to
be
spiteful."
Matthew
now,
for
the
first
time,
opened
his
lips.
"What
a
fool
Martin
is,
to
be
always
gabbling
about
what
he
does
not
understand!"
"It
is
my
privilege,
as
a
freeman,
to
gabble
on
whatever
subject
I
like,"
responded
Martin.
"You
use
it,
or
rather
abuse
it,
to
such
an
extent,"
rejoined
the
elder
brother,
"that
you
prove
you
ought
to
have
been
a
slave."
"A
slave!
a
slave!
That
to
a
Yorke,
and
from
a
Yorke!
