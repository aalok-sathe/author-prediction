but
I've
naught
to
fear
that
I
know
of.
I
don't
believe
there's
a
lad
in
these
parts
would
harm
me
at
least,
I'd
give
them
as
good
as
I
got
if
they
offered
to
do
it.
I
said,
'Is
there
aught
wrong
anywhere?'
''Deed
is
there,'
somebody
says,
speaking
out
of
the
ground,
like.
'What's

Be

I
ordered.
'Nobbut
four
on
us
ligging
in
a
ditch,'
says
Joe,
as
quiet

my
penknife;
and
Scott
would
ride
wi'
me,
to
tell
me
all
how
it
happened;
and
t'
others
are
coming
on
as
fast
as
their
feet
will
bring
them."
"Well,
I
am
greatly
obliged
