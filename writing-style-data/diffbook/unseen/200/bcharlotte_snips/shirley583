I
let
you
go.
How
could
you
imagine
it?
It
is
a
shabby
little
figure
of
a
private
soldier;
they
had
posted
him
as
sentinel.
He
is
safe
in
the
mill
now.
I
saw
the
door
open
and
admit
him.
My
mind
grows
easier.
Robert
is
prepared.
Our
warning
would
have
been
superfluous;
and
now
I
am
thankful
we
came
too
late
to
give
it.
It
has
saved
us
the
trouble
of
a
scene.
How
fine
to
have
entered
the
counting
house
toute
eperdue,
and
to
have
found
oneself
in
presence
of
Messrs.
Armitage
and
Ramsden
smoking,
Malone
swaggering,
your
uncle
sneering,
Mr.
Sykes
sipping
a
cordial,
and
Moore
himself
in
his
cold

there

the
mill,
Shirley!"
"Plenty
to
defend
it.
The
soldiers
we
have
twice
seen
to
day
were
going
there,
no
doubt,
and
the
group
we
noticed
surrounding
your
cousin
in
the
fields
will
be
with
him."
"What
are
they
doing
now,
Shirley?
What
is
that
noise?"
"Hatchets
and
crowbars
against
the
yard
gates.
They
are
forcing
them.
Are
you
afraid?"
"No;
but
my
heart
throbs
fast.
I
have
a
difficulty
