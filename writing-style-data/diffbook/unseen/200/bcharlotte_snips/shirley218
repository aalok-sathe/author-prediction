on
'em
do
as
mich,
and
some
o'
t'
bonniest
and
mimmest
looking,
too
ay,
I've
seen
clean,
trim
young
things,
that
looked
as
denty
and
pure
as
daisies,
and
wi'
time
a
body
fun'
'em
out
to
be
nowt
but
stinging,
venomed
nettles."
"Joe's
a
sensible
fellow,"
interjected
Helstone.
"Howsiver,
Sarah
had
another
string
to
her
bow.
Fred
Murgatroyd,
one
of
our
lads,
is
for
her;
and
as
women
judge
men
by
their
faces
and
Fred
has
a
middling
face,
while
Moses
is
none
so
handsome,
as
we
all
knaw
the
lass
took
on
wi'
Fred.

two
three
months
sin',
Murgatroyd
and
Moses
chanced
to
meet
one
Sunday
night;
they'd
both
come
lurking
about
these
premises
wi'
the
notion
of
counselling
Sarah
to
tak
a
bit
of
a
walk
wi'
them.
They
fell
out,
had
a
tussle,
and
Fred
was
worsted,
for
he's
young
and
small,
and
Barraclough,
for
all
he
has
only
one
leg,
is
almost
as
strong
as
Sugden
there
indeed,
anybody
that
hears
him
roaring
at
a
revival
or
a
love
feast
may
be
sure
he's
no
weakling."
"Joe,
you're
insupportable,"
here
broke
in
Mr.
Moore.
"You
spin
out
your
explanation
as
Moses
spins
out
