name
in
my
mother's
family.
I
adopted
it
that
I
might
live
unmolested.
My
married
name
recalled
too
vividly
my
married
life;
I
could
not
bear
it.
Besides,
threats
were
uttered
of
forcing
me
to
return
to
bondage.
It
could
not
be.
Rather
a
bier
for
a
bed,
the
grave
for
a
home.
My
new
name
sheltered
me.
I
resumed
under
its
screen
my
old
occupation
of
teaching.
At
first
it
scarcely
procured
me
the
means
of
sustaining
life;
but
how
savoury
was
hunger
when
I
fasted
in
peace!
How
safe
seemed
the
darkness
and
chill
of
an
unkindled
hearth
when
no
lurid
reflection
from
terror
crimsoned
its
desolation!
How
serene
was
solitude,
when
I
feared
not
the
irruption
of
violence
and
vice!"
"But,
mamma,
you
have
been
in
this
neighbourhood
before.
How
did
it
happen
that
when
you
reappeared
here
with
Miss
Keeldar
you
were
not
recognized?"
"I
only
paid
a
short
visit,
as
a
bride,
twenty
years
ago,
and
then
I
was
very
different
to
what
I
am
now
slender,
almost
as
slender
as
my
daughter
is
at
this
day.
My
complexion,
my
very
features
are
changed;
my
hair,
my
style
of
dress
everything
is
altered.
