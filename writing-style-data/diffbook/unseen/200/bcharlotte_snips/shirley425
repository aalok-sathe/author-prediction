crumb
of
nourishment,
that,
if
freely
given,
would
have
brought
back
abundance
of
life
where
life
was
failing;
but
the
generous
feast
was
snatched
from
her,
spread
before
another,
and
she
remained
but
a
bystander
at
the
banquet.
The
clock
struck
nine;
it
was
Caroline's
time
for
going
home.
She
gathered
up
her
work,
put
the
embroidery,
the
scissors,
the
thimble
into
her
bag.
She
bade
Mrs.

receiving
from
that

"I
have

forgotten."
Her
mind
misgave
her
that
neither
those
plans
nor
any
other
could
permanently
restore
her
mental
tranquillity.
She
turned
to
Robert,
who
stood
close
behind
her.
As
he
looked
up,
the
light
of
the
candles
on
the
mantelpiece
fell
full
on
her
face.
All
its
paleness,
all
its
change,
all
its
forlorn
meaning
were
clearly
revealed.
Robert
had

eyes,
