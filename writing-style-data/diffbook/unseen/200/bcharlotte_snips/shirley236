without
envy
or
hatred
of
those
more
happily
circumstanced
than
himself,
thinking
it
no
hardship
and
no
injustice
to
be
forced
to
live
by
labour,
disposed
to
be
honourably
content

Moore
might

It
seemed
wonderful
how
he
could
turn
from
such
a
man

The
poor
fellow's
face
looked
haggard

dejected,
austere,
but
still
patient.
How

Moore
leave

thus,
with
the
words,
"I'll
never
give
in,"
and
not
a
whisper
of
good
will,
or
hope,
or
aid?
Farren,

times,
a

clean,
pleasant
place,
but
now,
though
still
clean,
very
dreary,
because
so
poor
asked
himself
this
question.
He
concluded
that
the
foreign
mill
owner
was
a
selfish,
an
unfeeling,
and,
he
thought,
too,
a
foolish
man.
It
