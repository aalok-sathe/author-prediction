from
that
chateau
on
the
Scheldt
Miss
Moore
talks
about."
"Martin,"
said
the
softest
whisper
at
the
door,
"don't
be
foolish."
"Is
she
there?"
inquired
Moore
hastily.
He
had
caught
an
imperfect
sound.
"She
is
there,
fit
to
faint.
She
is
standing
on
the
mat,
shocked
at
your
want
of
filial
affection."
"Martin,
you
are
an
evil
cross
between
an
imp
and
a
page.
What
is
she
like?"
"More
like
me
than
you;
for
she
is
young
and
beautiful."
"You
are
to
show
her
forward.
Do
you
hear?"
"Come,
Miss
Caroline."
"Miss
Caroline!"
repeated
Moore.
And
when
Miss
Caroline
entered
she
was
encountered
in
the
middle
of
the
chamber
by
a
tall,
thin,
wasted
figure,
who
took
both
her
hands.
"I
give
you
a
quarter
of
an
hour,"
said
Martin,
as
he
withdrew,
"no
more.
Say
what
you
have
to
say
in
that
time.
Till
it
is
past
I
will
wait
in
the
gallery;
nothing
shall
approach;
I'll
see
you
safe
away.
Should
you
persist
in
staying
longer,
I
leave
you
to
your
fate."
He
shut
the
door.
In
the
gallery
he
was
as
elate
as
a
king.
He
had
never
been
engaged
in
an
adventure
he
liked
so
well,
