another
chapter
to
his
commenced
romance.
He
did
not
yet
know
how
many
commenced
life
romances
are
doomed
never
to
get
beyond
the
first,
or
at
most
the
second
chapter.
His
Saturday
half
holiday
he
spent
in
the
wood
with
his
book
of
fairy
legends,
and
that
other
unwritten
book
of
his
imagination.
Martin
harboured
an
irreligious
reluctance
to
see
the
approach
of
Sunday.
His
father
and
mother,
while
disclaiming
community
with
the
Establishment,
failed
not
duly,
once
on
the
sacred
day,
to
fill
their
large
pew
in
Briarfield
Church
with
the
whole
of
their
blooming
family.
Theoretically,
Mr.
Yorke
placed
all
sects
and
churches
on
a
level.
Mrs.
Yorke
awarded
the
palm
to
Moravians
and
Quakers,
on
account
of
that
crown
of
humility
by
these
worthies
worn.
Neither
of
them
were
ever
known,
however,
to
set
foot
in
a
conventicle.
Martin,
I
say,
disliked
Sunday,
because
the
morning
service
was
long,
and
the
sermon
usually
little
to
his
taste.
This
Saturday
afternoon,
however,
his
woodland
musings
disclosed
to
him
a
new
found
charm
in
the
coming
day.
It
proved
a
day
of
deep
snow
so
deep
that
Mrs.
Yorke
during
breakfast
announced
her
conviction
that

children,
both
