Having
accompanied
her
to
her
apartment,
and
promised
to
rejoin
her
there
when
things
were
settled,
Caroline
left
her
to
see,
as
she
said,
"if
she
could
be
useful."
She
presently
found
that
she
could
be
very
useful;
for
the
retinue
of
servants
at
Fieldhead
was
by
no
means
numerous,
and
just
now
their
mistress
found
plenty
of
occupation
for
all
the
hands
at
her
command,
and
for
her
own
also.
The
delicate
good
nature
and
dexterous
activity
which
Caroline
brought
to
the
aid
of
the
housekeeper
and
maids
all
somewhat
scared
by
their
lady's
unwonted
mood
did
a
world
of
good
at
once;
it
helped
the
assistants
and
appeased
the
directress.
A
chance
glance
and
smile
from
Caroline
moved
Shirley
to
an
answering
smile
directly.
The
former
was
carrying
a
heavy
basket
up
the
cellar
stairs.
"This
is
a
shame!"
cried
Shirley,
running
to
her.
"It
will
strain
your
arm."
She
took
it
from
her,
and
herself
bore
it
out
into
the
yard.
The
cloud
of
temper
was
dispelled
when
she
came
back;
the
flash
in
her
eye
was
melted;
the
shade
on
her
forehead
vanished.
She
resumed
her
usual
cheerful
and
cordial
manner
to
those
about
her,
tempering
