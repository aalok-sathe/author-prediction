it
was
different
to
his
descendants.
He
has
long,
curling
dark
hair;
he
is
carefully
and
cavalierly
dressed.
Having
said
that
he
is
like
me,
I
need
not
add
that
he
is
handsome."
"You
are
not
handsome,
Martin."
"No;
but
wait
awhile
just
let
me
take
my
time.
I
mean
to
begin
from
this
day
to
cultivate,
to
polish,
and
we
shall
see."
"You
are
a
very
strange,
a
very
unaccountable
boy,
Martin.
But
don't
imagine
you
ever
will
be
handsome;
you
cannot."
"I
mean
to
try.
But
we
were
talking
about
Mrs.
Pryor.
She
must
be
the
most
unnatural
mamma
in
existence,
coolly
to
let
her
daughter
come
out
in
this
weather.
Mine
was
in
such
a
rage
because
I
would
go
to
church;
she
was
fit
to
fling
the
kitchen
brush
after
me."
"Mamma
was
very
much
concerned
about
me;
but
I
am
afraid
I
was
obstinate.
I
would
go."
"To
see
me?"
"Exactly;
I
thought
of
nothing
else.
I
greatly
feared
the
snow
would
hinder
you
from
coming.
You
don't
know
how
pleased
I
was
to
see
you
all
by
yourself
in
the
pew."
"I
came
to
fulfil
my
duty,
and
set
the
parish
a
good
example.
