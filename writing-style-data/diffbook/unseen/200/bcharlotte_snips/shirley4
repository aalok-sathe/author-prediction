gentlemen
are
in
the
bloom
of
youth;
they
possess
all
the
activity
of
that
interesting
age
an
activity
which
their
moping
old
vicars
would
fain
turn
into
the
channel
of
their
pastoral
duties,
often
expressing
a
wish
to
see
it
expended
in
a
diligent
superintendence
of
the
schools,
and
in
frequent
visits
to
the
sick
of
their
respective
parishes.
But
the
youthful
Levites
feel
this
to
be
dull
work;
they
prefer
lavishing
their
energies
on
a
course
of
proceeding
which,
though
to
other
eyes
it
appear
more
heavy
with
ennui,
more
cursed
with
monotony,
than
the
toil
of
the
weaver
at
his
loom,
seems
to
yield
them
an
unfailing
supply
of
enjoyment
and
occupation.
I
allude
to
a
rushing
backwards
and
forwards,
amongst
themselves,
to
and
from
their
respective
lodgings
not
a
round,
but
a
triangle
of
visits,
which
they
keep
up
all
the
year
through,
in
winter,
spring,
summer,
and
autumn.
Season
and
weather
make
no
difference;
with
unintelligible
zeal
they
dare
snow
and
hail,
wind
and
rain,
mire
and
dust,
to
go
and
dine,
or
drink
tea,
or
sup
with
each
other.
What
attracts
them
it
would
be
difficult
to
say.
It
is
not
friendship,
for
whenever
they
