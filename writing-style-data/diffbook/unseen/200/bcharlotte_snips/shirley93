broken
my
frames
that
I
have
none
to
spare
for
my
private
acquaintance,
and
still
less
for
such
a
vague
thing
as
a
sect
or
a
government.
But
really,
gentlemen,
you
both
seem
very
bad
by
your
own
showing
worse
than
ever
I
suspected
you
to
be.
I
dare
not
stay
all
night
with
a
rebel
and
blasphemer
like
you,
Yorke;
and
I

dare
ride

with
a
cruel

said
the

"Nay,

have

He
rang
the
bell.
"Deb,"
said
he
to
the
servant
who
answered
it,
"clear
them
folk
out
o'
t'
kitchen,
and
lock
t'
doors,
and
be
off
to
bed.
Here
is
your
way,
gentlemen,"
he
continued
to
his
guests;
and,
lighting
them
through
the
passage,
he
fairly
put
them
out
at
his
front
door.
They
met
their
party
hurrying
out

the
back

horses

the
gate;
