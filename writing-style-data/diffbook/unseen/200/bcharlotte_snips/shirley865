Moore
watched
the
rapid
motion
of
her
fingers,
as
the
green
and
purple
garland
grew
beneath
them.
After
a
prolonged
pause,
he
again
asked,
"Is
the
shadow
quite
gone?"
"Wholly.
As
I
was
two
hours
since,
and
as
I
am
now,
are
two
different
states
of
existence.
I

Mr.
Moore,

Poverty
and
pride
often
go

"That
is

I

Mr.
Moore."
"Immediately.
What

sober

Caprice?"
"Are
