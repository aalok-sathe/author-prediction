sir,
as
a
clergyman,"
said
he,
"may
feel
it
disagreeable
to
be
present
amidst
scenes
of
hurry
and
flurry,
and,
I
may
say,
peril.
I
dare
say
your
nerves
won't
stand
it.
You're
a
man
of
peace,
sir;
but
we
manufacturers,
living
in
the
world,
and
always
in
turmoil,
get
quite

Really,
there's
an
ardour
excited

brief
and
low,
and
by
no
means
insulting,
was
the
response
of
the
rector.
Moore
would
have
pressed
upon
the
heroic
mill
owner
a
third
tumbler,
but
the
clergyman,
who
never
transgressed,
nor
would
suffer
others
in
his
presence
to
transgress,
the
bounds
of
decorum,
checked
him.
"Enough
is
as
good
as
a
feast,
is
it
not,
Mr.
Sykes?"
he
said;
and
Mr.
Sykes
assented,
and
then
sat
and
watched
Joe
Scott
