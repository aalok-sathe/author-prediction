felt
it.
When
I
looked
up
at
him
after
repeating
Chenier's
poem,
his
eyes
(what
handsome
eyes
he
has!)
sent
the
truth
through
my
heart.
Sometimes
I
am
afraid
to
speak
to
him,
lest
I
should
be
too
frank,
lest
I
should
seem
forward
for
I
have
more
than
once
regretted
bitterly
overflowing,
superfluous
words,
and
feared
I
had
said
more
than
he
expected
me
to
say,
and
that
he
would
disapprove
what
he
might
deem
my
indiscretion;
now,
to
night
I
could
have
ventured
to
express
any
thought,
he
was
so
indulgent.
How
kind
he
was
as
we
walked
up
the
lane!
He
does
not
flatter
or
say
foolish
things;
his
love
making
(friendship,
I
mean;
of
course
I
don't
yet
account
him
my
lover,
but
I
hope
he
will
be
so
some
day)
is
not
like
what
we
read
of
in
books,
it
is
far
better
original,
quiet,
manly,
sincere.
I
do
like
him;
I
would
be
an
excellent
wife
to
him
if
he
did
marry
me;
I
would
tell
him
of
his
faults
(for
he
has
a
few
faults),
but
I
would
study
his
comfort,
and
cherish
him,
and
do
my
best
to
make
him
happy.
Now,
