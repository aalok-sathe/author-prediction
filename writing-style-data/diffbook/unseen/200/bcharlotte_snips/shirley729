broken;
you
have
been
so
neglected,
so
repulsed,
left
so
desolate."
"I
believe
grief
is,
and
always
has
been,
my
worst
ailment.
I
sometimes
think
if
an
abundant
gush
of
happiness
came
on
me
I
could
revive
yet."
"Do
you
wish
to
live?"
"I
have
no
object
in
life."
"You
love
me,
Caroline?"
"Very
much
very
truly
inexpressibly
sometimes.
Just
now
I
feel
as
if
I
could
almost
grow
to
your
heart."
"I
will
return
directly,
dear,"
remarked
Mrs.
Pryor,
as
she
laid
Caroline
down.
Quitting
her,
she
glided
to
the
door,
softly
turned
the
key
in
the
lock,
ascertained
that
it
was
fast,
and
came
back.
She
bent
over
her.
She
threw
back
the
curtain
to
admit
the
moonlight
more
freely.
She
gazed
intently
on
her
face.
"Then,
if
you
love
me,"
said
she,
speaking
quickly,
with
an
altered
voice;
"if
you
feel
as
if,
to
use
your
own
words,
you
could
'grow
to
my
heart,'
it
will
be
neither
shock
nor
pain
for
you
to
know
that
that
heart
is
the
source
whence
yours
was
filled;
that
from
my
veins
issued
the
tide
which
flows
in
yours;
that
you
are
mine
my
daughter
my
own
child."
