attired
in
her
neatest
muslin,
to
spend
the
afternoon
at
Fieldhead,
there
to
superintend
certain
millinery
preparations
for
a
great
event,
the
last
appeal
in
these
matters
being
reserved
for
her
unimpeachable
taste.
She
decided
on
the
wreath,
the
veil,
the
dress
to
be
worn
at
the
altar.
She
chose
various
robes
and
fashions
for
more
ordinary
occasions,
without
much
reference
to
the
bride's
opinion
that
lady,
indeed,
being
in
a
somewhat
impracticable
mood.
Louis
had
presaged
difficulties,
and
he
had
found
them
in
fact,
his
mistress
had
shown
herself
exquisitely
provoking,
putting
off
her
marriage
day
by
day,
week
by
week,
month
by
month,
at
first
coaxing
him
with
soft
pretences
of
procrastination,
and
in
the
end
rousing
his
whole
deliberate
but
determined
nature
to
revolt
against
her
tyranny,
at
once
so
sweet
and
so
intolerable.
It
had
needed
a
sort
of
tempest
shock
to
bring
her
to
the
point;
but
there
she
was
at
last,
fettered
to
a
fixed
day.
There
she
lay,
conquered
by
love,
and
bound
with
a
vow.
Thus
vanquished
and
restricted,
she
pined,
like
any
other
chained
denizen
of
deserts.
Her
captor
alone
could
cheer
her;
his
society
only
could
make
amends
for
the
