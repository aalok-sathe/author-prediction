cosy
circle
now
enclosing
the
bright
little
schoolroom
fire.
She
then
took
the
post
of
toaster
general;
and
kneeling
on
the
rug,
fork
in
hand,
fulfilled
her
office
with
dexterity.
Mr.
Hall,
who
relished
any
homely
innovation
on
ordinary
usages,
and
to
whom
the
husky
oatcake
was
from
custom
suave
as
manna,
seemed
in
his
best
spirits.
He
talked
and
laughed
gleefully
now
with
Caroline,
whom
he
had
fixed

his
side,
now
with
Shirley,

He
did

Hall

his
entire
self
possession.
Nobody
there
present
seemed
to
impose
on
him
a
sensation
of
unpleasant
restraint.
Nobody
seemed
a
bore
a
check
a
chill
to
him;
and
yet
there
was
the
cool
and
lofty
Miss
Keeldar
kneeling
before
the
fire,
almost
at
his
feet.
But
Shirley
was
cool
and
lofty
no
