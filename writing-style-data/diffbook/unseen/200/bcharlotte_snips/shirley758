that
I
shall
cure
you.
Mamma,
put
your
work
down;
read
to
me.
I
like
your
southern
accent;
it
is
so
pure,
so
soft.
It
has
no
rugged
burr,
no
nasal
twang,
such
as
almost
every
one's
voice
here
in
the
north
has.
My
uncle
and
Mr.
Hall
say
that
you
are
a
fine
reader,
mamma.
Mr.
Hall
said
he
never
heard
any
lady
read
with
such
propriety
of
expression
or
purity
of
accent."
"I
wish
I
could
reciprocate
the
compliment,
Cary;
but,
really,

first
time
I
heard
your
truly

and
preach

speak
roughly?"
"No.

you
had,
as
I
wished
you
had
looked
unpolished.
Your
father,
Caroline,
naturally
spoke
well,
quite
otherwise
than
your
worthy
uncle
correctly,
gently,
smoothly.
You
inherit
the
gift."
"Poor
papa!
When
he
was
so
agreeable,
why
was
he
not
good?"
"Why
he
was
as
he
was
and
happily
of
that
you,
child,
can
form
no
conception
I
cannot
tell.
It
is
a
deep
mystery.
The
key
is
in
the
hands
of
his
Maker.
There
I
leave
it."
"Mamma,
you
will
keep
