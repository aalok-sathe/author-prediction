lesser
fortune
was
openly
relinquished
for
that
of
the
greater.
On
what
grounds
he
expected
to
succeed
in
his
chase
himself
best
knew;
certainly
not
by
skilful
management.
From
the
length
of
time
that
elapsed,
it
appeared
that
John
had
some
difficulty
in
persuading
Mr.
Donne
to
descend.
At
length,
however,
that
gentleman
appeared;
nor,
as
he
presented
himself
at
the
oak
parlour
door,
did
he
seem
in
the
slightest
degree
ashamed
or
confused
not
a
whit.
Donne,
indeed,
was
of
that
coldly
phlegmatic,
immovably
complacent,
densely
self
satisfied
nature
which
is
insensible
to
shame.
He
had
never
blushed
in
his
life;
no
humiliation
could
abash
him;
his
nerves
were
not
capable
of
sensation
enough
to
stir
his
life
and
make
colour
mount
to
his
cheek;
he
had
no
fire
in
his
blood
and
no
modesty
in
his
soul;
he
was
a
frontless,
arrogant,
decorous
slip
of
the
commonplace
conceited,
inane,
insipid;
and
this
gentleman
had
a
notion
of
wooing
Miss
Keeldar!
He
knew
no
more,
however,
how
to
set
about
the
business
than
if
he
had
been
an
image
carved
in
wood.
He
had
no
idea
of
a
taste
to
be
pleased,
a
heart
to
be
reached
in
courtship.
