The
outside
was,
as
usual,
still
and
shy.
Only
half
of
Moore's
activity
and
resolution
had
been
seen
in
his
defence
of
the
mill;
he
showed
the
other
half
(and
a
terrible
half
it
was)
in
the
indefatigable,
the
relentless
assiduity
with
which
he
pursued
the
leaders
of
the
riot.
The
mob,
the
mere
followers,
he
let
alone.
Perhaps
an
innate
sense

told
him
that

he

him
on

without
notice
or
threat.
The
leaders
he
did
not
know.
They
were
strangers
emissaries
from
the
large
towns.
Most
of
these
were
not
members
of
the
operative
class.
They
were
chiefly
"down
draughts,"
bankrupts,
men
always
in
debt
and
often
in

men
