said
Shirley.
"You
are
a
lady
like
little
person,
Caroline.
Is
she
not,
Mrs.
Pryor?"
Mrs.
Pryor
never
paid
compliments,
and
seldom
indulged
in
remarks,
favourable
or
otherwise,
on
personal
appearance.
On
the
present
occasion
she
only
swept
Caroline's
curls
from
her
cheek
as
she
took
a
seat
near
her,
caressed
the
oval
outline,
and
observed,
"You
get
somewhat
thin,
my

I

extremely

kitchens
there
were
once
enclosed
in
the
churchyard,
and
that
there
are
graves
under
them.
I

"My
dear,
you
are
surely
not
superstitious?"
"No,
Mrs.
Pryor;
but
I
think
I
grow
what
is
called
nervous.
I
see
things
under
a
darker
aspect
than
I
used
to
do.

never
used
to
