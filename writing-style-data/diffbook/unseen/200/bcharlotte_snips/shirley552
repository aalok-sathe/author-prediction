him
books,
to
give
him
plants;
and
they
preferred
his
conversation
far
before
that
of
many
coarse,
hard,
pretentious
people
immeasurably
higher
in
station.
"Who
was
speaking,
William,
when
you
came
out?"
asked
Shirley.
"A
gentleman
ye
set
a
deal
of
store
on,
Miss
Shirley
Mr.
Donne."
"You
look
knowing,
William.
How
did
you
find
out
my
regard
for
Mr.
Donne?"
"Ay,
Miss
Shirley,
there's
a
gleg
light
i'
your
een
sometimes
which
betrays
you.
You
look
raight
down
scornful
sometimes
when
Mr.
Donne
is
by."
"Do
you
like
him
yourself,
William?"
"Me?
I'm
stalled
o'
t'
curates,
and
so
is
t'
wife.
They've
no
manners.
They
talk
to
poor
folk
fair
as
if
they
thought
they
were
beneath
them.
They're
allus
magnifying
their
office.
It
is
a
pity
but
their
office
could
magnify
them;
but
it
does
nought
o'
t'
soart.
I
fair
hate
pride."
"But
you
are
proud
in
your
own
way
yourself,"
interposed
Caroline.
"You
are
what
you
call
house
proud:
you
like
to
have
everything
handsome
about
you.
Sometimes
you
look
as
if
you
were
almost
too
proud
to
take
your
wages.
When
you
were
out
of
work,
you
were
too
proud
to
get
anything
on
