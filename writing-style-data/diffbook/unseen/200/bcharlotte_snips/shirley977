for
no
adventure
had
ever
invested
him
with
so
much
importance
or
inspired
him
with
so
much
interest.
"You
are
come
at
last,"
said
the
meagre
man,
gazing
on
his
visitress
with
hollow
eyes.
"Did
you
expect
me
before?"
"For
a
month,
near
two
months,
we
have
been
very
near;
and
I
have
been
in
sad
pain,
and
danger,
and
misery,
Cary."
"I
could
not
come."
"Couldn't
you?
But
the
rectory
and
Briarmains
are
very
near
not
two
miles
apart."
There
was
pain
and
there
was
pleasure
in
the
girl's
face
as
she
listened
to
these
implied
reproaches.
It
was
sweet,
it
was
bitter
to
defend
herself.
"When
I
say
I
could
not
come,
I
mean
I
could
not
see
you;
for
I
came
with
mamma
the
very
day
we
heard
what
had
happened.
Mr.
MacTurk
then
told
us
it
was
impossible
to
admit
any
stranger."
"But
afterwards
every
fine
afternoon
these
many
weeks
past
I
have
waited
and
listened.
Something
here,
Cary"
laying
his
hand
on
his
breast
"told
me
it
was
impossible
but
that
you
should
think
of
me.
Not
that
I
merit
thought;
but
we
are
old
acquaintance
we
are
cousins."
"I
came
again,
Robert;
mamma
and
