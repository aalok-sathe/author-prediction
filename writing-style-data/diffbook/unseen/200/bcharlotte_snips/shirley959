arrested,
cribbed,
tried,
and
brought
in
for
Botany
Bay,
at
the
very
least."
The
questioner,
perhaps,
did
nor
hear
this
judgment.
She
stood
motionless.
In
two
minutes,
without
another
word,
she
moved
forwards;
no
good
night,
no
further
inquiry.
This
was
not
amusing,
nor
what
Martin
had
calculated
on.
He
expected
something
dramatic
and
demonstrative.
It
was
hardly
worth
while
to
frighten
the
girl
if
she
would
not
entertain
him
in
return.
He
called,
"Miss
Helstone!"
She
did
not
hear
or
turn.
He
hastened
after
and
overtook
her.
"Come;
are
you
uneasy
about
what
I
said?"
"You
know
nothing
about
death,
Martin;
you
are
too
young
for
me
to
talk
to
concerning
such
a
thing."
"Did
you
believe
me?
It's
all
flummery!
Moore
eats
like
three
men.
They
are
always
making
sago
or
tapioca
or
something
good
for
him.
I
never
go
into
the
kitchen
but
there
is
a
saucepan
on
the
fire,
cooking
him
some
dainty.
I
think
I
will
play
the
old
soldier,
and
be
fed
on
the
fat
of
the
land
like
him."
"Martin!
Martin!"
Here
her
voice
trembled,
and
she
stopped.
"It
is
exceedingly
wrong
of
you,
Martin.
You
have
almost
killed
me."
Again
she
stopped.
