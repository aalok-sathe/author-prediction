so
eagerly
to
overcome
or
escape,
they
had
no
idea,
of
her
racked
nights
and
dismal
days
no
suspicion.
It
was
at
once
impossible
and
hopeless
to
explain;
to
wait
and
endure
was
her
only
plan.
Many
that
want
food
and
clothing
have
cheerier
lives
and
brighter
prospects
than
she
had;
many,
harassed
by
poverty,
are
in
a
strait
less
afflictive.
"Now,
is
your
mind
quieted?"
inquired
Shirley.
"Will
you
consent
to
stay
at
home?"
"I
shall
not
leave
it
against
the
approbation
of
my
friends,"
was
the
reply;
"but
I
think
in
time
they
will
be
obliged
to
think
as
I
do."
During
this
conversation
Mrs.
Pryor
looked
far
from
easy.
Her
extreme
habitual
reserve
would
rarely
permit
her
to
talk
freely
or
to
interrogate
others
closely.
She
could
think
a
multitude
of
questions
she
never
ventured
to
put,
give
advice
in
her
mind
which
her
tongue
never
delivered.
Had
she
been
alone
with
Caroline,
she
might
possibly
have
said
something
to
the
point:
Miss
Keeldar's
presence,
accustomed
as
she
was
to
it,
sealed
her
lips.
Now,
as
on
a
thousand
other
occasions,
inexplicable
nervous
scruples
kept
her
back
from
interfering.
She
merely
showed
her
concern
for
Miss
Helstone
