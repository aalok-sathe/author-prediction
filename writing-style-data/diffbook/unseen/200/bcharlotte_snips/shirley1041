or
sing
the
very
songs
you
have
caught
up
by
ear
from
my
voice.
I
do
not
ask
whence
flows
the
feeling
which
you
pour
into
these
songs,
for
I
know
it
flows
out
of
your
heart,
Miss
Keeldar.
In
the
winter
evenings
Tartar
lies
at
your
feet.
You
suffer
him
to
rest
his
head
on
your
perfumed
lap;
you
let
him
couch
on
the
borders
of
your
satin
raiment.
His
rough
hide
is
familiar
with
the
contact
of
your
hand.
I
once
saw
you
kiss
him
on
that
snow
white
beauty
spot
which
stars
his
broad
forehead.
It
is
dangerous
to
say
I
am
like
Tartar;
it
suggests
to
me
a
claim
to
be
treated
like
Tartar.'
"'Perhaps,
sir,
you
can
extort
as
much
from
your
penniless
and
friendless
young
orphan
girl,
when
you
find
her.'
"'Oh
could
I
find
her
such
as
I
image
her!
Something
to
tame
first,
and
teach
afterwards;
to
break
in,
and
then
to
fondle.
To
lift
the
destitute
proud
thing
out
of
poverty;
to
establish
power
over
and
then
to
be
indulgent
to
the
capricious
moods
that
never
were
influenced
and
never
indulged
before;
to
see
her
alternately
irritated
and
subdued
about
