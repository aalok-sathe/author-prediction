and
though
the
beef
was
"tough,"
they
ate
a
great
deal
of
it.
They
swallowed,
too,
a
tolerable
allowance
of
the
"flat
beer,"
while
a
dish
of
Yorkshire
pudding,
and
two
tureens
of
vegetables,
disappeared
like
leaves
before
locusts.
The
cheese,
too,
received
distinguished
marks
of
their
attention;
and
a
"spice
cake,"
which
followed
by
way
of
dessert,
vanished
like
a
vision,
and
was
no
more
found.
Its
elegy
was
chanted
in
the
kitchen
by
Abraham,
Mrs.
Gale's
son
and
heir,
a
youth
of
six
summers;
he
had
reckoned
upon
the
reversion
thereof,
and
when
his
mother
brought
down
the
empty
platter,
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
wept
sore.
The
curates,
meantime,
sat
and
sipped
their
wine,
a
liquor
of
unpretending
vintage,
moderately
enjoyed.
Mr.
Malone,
indeed,
would
much
rather
have
had
whisky;
but
Mr.
Donne,
being
an
Englishman,
did
not
keep
the
beverage.
While
they
sipped
they
argued,
not
on
politics,
nor
on
philosophy,
nor
on
literature
these
topics
were
now,
as
ever,
totally
without
interest
for
them
not
even
on
theology,
practical
or
doctrinal,
but
on
minute
points
of
ecclesiastical
discipline,
frivolities
which
seemed
empty
as
bubbles
to
all
save
themselves.
Mr.
Malone,
who
contrived
to
