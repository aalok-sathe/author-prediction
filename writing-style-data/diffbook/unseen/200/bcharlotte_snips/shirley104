a
small
parlour,
where
a
breakfast
of
coffee
and
bread
and
butter,
with
the
somewhat
un
English
accompaniment
of
stewed
pears,
was
spread
on
the
table.
Over
these
viands
presided
the
lady
who
had
spoken
from
the
window.
I
must
describe
her
before
I
go
any
farther.
She
seemed
a
little
older
than
Mr.
Moore
perhaps
she
was
thirty
five,
tall,
and
proportionately
stout;
she
had
very
black
hair,
for
the
present
twisted
up
in
curl
papers,
a
high
colour
in
her
cheeks,
a
small
nose,
a
pair
of
little
black
eyes.
The
lower
part
of
her
face
was
large
in
proportion
to
the
upper;
her
forehead
was
small
and
rather
corrugated;
she
had
a
fretful
though
not
an
ill
natured
expression
of
countenance;
there
was
something
in
her
whole
appearance
one
felt
inclined
to
be
half
provoked
with
and
half
amused
at.
The
strangest
point
was
her
dress
a
stuff
petticoat
and
a
striped
cotton
camisole.
The
petticoat
was
short,
displaying
well
a
pair
of
feet
and
ankles
which
left
much
to
be
desired
in
the
article
of
symmetry.
You
will
think
I
have
depicted
a
remarkable
slattern,
reader.
Not
at
all.

was
Mr.
Moore's
sister)
