she
was

a

have
purchased
the
whole
stock
than
contributed
a
single
pin

It
ought
perhaps
to
be
explained
in

for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
not
au
fait
to
the
mysteries
of
the
"Jew
basket"
and
"missionary
basket,"
that
these

are
willow
repositories,
of
the
capacity
of
a
good
sized
family
clothes
basket,
dedicated
to
the
purpose
of
conveying
from
house
to

a
monster
collection
of
pin
cushions,
needle
books,
card
racks,
workbags,
articles
of
infant
wear,

made
by
the
willing

of
the
Christian
ladies
of
a
parish,
and
sold
perforce
to
the
heathenish
gentlemen
thereof,
at
prices
unblushingly
exorbitant.
The
proceeds
of
such
compulsory
sales
are
applied
to
the
conversion
of
the
Jews,
the
seeking
up
of
the
ten
missing
tribes,
or
to
the
regeneration
of
the
interesting
coloured
population
of
the
globe.
Each

contributor
takes
it
in
her
turn
to
keep
the
basket
a
month,
to
sew
for
it,
