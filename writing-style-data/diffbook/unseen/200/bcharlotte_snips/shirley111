she
has
more
intimate
opportunities
of
knowing
me.
She
sees
that
I
have
education,
intelligence,
manner,
principles
all,
in
short,
which
belongs
to
a
person
well
born
and
well
bred."
"Are
you
at
all
fond
of
her?"
"For
fond
I
cannot
say.
I
am
not
one
who
is
prone

and,
consequently,
my
friendship
is
the
more

I
perceive
clearly

Caroline
is
not
perfect,
that
there
is
much

be
desired
in
her."
"Give
me
a
last
cup
of
coffee,
and
while
I
am
drinking
it
amuse
me
with
an
account
of
her
faults."
"Dear
brother,
I
am
happy
to
see
you
eat
your
breakfast
with
relish,
after
the
fatiguing
