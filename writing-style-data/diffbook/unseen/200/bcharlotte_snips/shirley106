their
decayed
family,
the
persons
of
both
were
almost
sacred
in
her
eyes.
Of
Louis,
however,
she
knew
less
than
of
Robert.
He
had
been
sent
to
England
when
a
mere
boy,
and
had
received
his
education
at
an
English
school.
His
education
not
being
such
as
to
adapt
him
for
trade,
perhaps,
too,
his
natural
bent
not
inclining
him
to
mercantile
pursuits,
he
had,
when
the
blight
of
hereditary
prospects
rendered
it
necessary
for
him
to
push
his
own
fortune,
adopted
the
very
arduous
and
very
modest
career
of
a
teacher.
He
had
been
usher
in
a
school,
and
was
said
now
to
be
tutor
in
a
private
family.
Hortense,
when
she
mentioned
Louis,
described
him
as
having
what
she
called
"des
moyens,"
but
as
being
too
backward
and
quiet.
Her
praise
of
Robert
was
in
a
different
strain,
less
qualified:
she
was
very
proud
of
him;
she
regarded
him
as
the
greatest
man
in
Europe;
all
he
said
and
did
was
remarkable
in
her
eyes,
and
she
expected
others
to
behold
him
from
the
same
point
of
view;
nothing
could
be
more
irrational,
monstrous,
and
infamous
than
opposition
from
any
quarter
to
Robert,
unless
it
were
opposition
to
