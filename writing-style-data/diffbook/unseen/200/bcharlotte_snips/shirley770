asked
me
who
Henry's
tutor
was,
I
would
have
told
you.
Besides,
I
thought
you
knew."
"I
am
puzzled
about
more
things
than
one
in
this
matter.
You
don't
like
poor
Louis.
Why?
Are
you
impatient
at
what
you
perhaps
consider
his
servile
position?
Do
you
wish
that
Robert's
brother
were
more
highly
placed?"
"Robert's
brother,
indeed!"
was
the
exclamation,
uttered
in
a
tone
like
the
accents
of
scorn;
and
with
a
movement
of
proud
impatience
Shirley
snatched
a
rose
from
a
branch
peeping
through
the
open
lattice.
"Yes,"
repeated
Caroline,
with
mild
firmness,
"Robert's

Moore
of

nature
has
not
given
him
features
so

as
his
kinsman;
but
his
blood
is
as
good,
and
he
is
as
much
a
gentleman
were
he
free."
"Wise,
humble,
pious
Caroline!"
exclaimed
Shirley
ironically.
"Men
and
angels,
hear
her!
We
should
not
despise
plain
features,
nor
a
laborious
yet
honest
occupation,
should
we?
Look
at
the
subject
of
your
panegyric.
He
is
there
in
the
garden,"
she
continued,
pointing
through
an
aperture
in
the
clustering
creepers;
and
by
that
aperture
Louis
Moore
was
visible,
coming
slowly
down
