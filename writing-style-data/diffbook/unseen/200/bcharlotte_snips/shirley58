For
the
rest,
he
was
a
conscientious,
hard
headed,
hard
handed,
brave,
stern,
implacable,
faithful
little
man;
a
man
almost
without
sympathy,
ungentle,
prejudiced,
and
rigid,
but
a
man
true
to
principle,
honourable,
sagacious,
and
sincere.
It
seems
to
me,
reader,
that
you
cannot
always
cut
out
men
to
fit
their
profession,
and
that
you
ought
not
to
curse
them
because
their
profession
sometimes
hangs
on
them
ungracefully.
Nor
will
I
curse
Helstone,
clerical
Cossack
as
he
was.
Yet
he
was
cursed,
and
by
many
of
his
own
parishioners,
as
by
others
he
was
adored
which
is
the
frequent
fate
of
men
who
show
partiality
in
friendship
and
bitterness
in
enmity,
who
are
equally
attached
to
principles
and
adherent
to
prejudices.
Helstone
and
Moore
being
both
in
excellent
spirits,
and
united
for
the
present
in
one
cause,
you
would
expect
that,
as
they
rode
side
by
side,
they
would
converse
amicably.
Oh
no!
These
two
men,
of
hard,
bilious
natures
both,
rarely
came
into
contact
but
they
chafed
each
other's
moods.
Their
frequent
bone
of
contention
was
the
war.
Helstone
was
a
high
Tory
(there
were
Tories
in
those
days),
and
Moore
was
a
bitter
Whig
a
Whig,
at
least,
