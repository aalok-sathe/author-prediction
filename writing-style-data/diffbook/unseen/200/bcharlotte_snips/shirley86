his
stay.
His
wife,
after
a
year
or
two,
was
of
no
great
importance
to
him
in
any
shape;
and
when
she
one
day,
as
he
thought,
suddenly
for
he
had
scarcely
noticed
her
decline
but,
as
others
thought,
gradually,
took
her
leave
of
him
and
of
life,
and
there
was
only
a
still,
beautiful
featured
mould
of
clay
left,
cold
and
white,
in
the
conjugal
couch,
he
felt
his
bereavement
who
shall
say
how
little?
Yet,
perhaps,
more
than
he
seemed
to
feel
it;
for
he
was
not

His
dry

old
housekeeper,
and
likewise

who
had
waited

Mrs.
Helstone
in
her
sickness,
and
who,
perhaps,
had
had
opportunities
of
learning
more
of
the
deceased
lady's
nature,
of
her
capacity
for
feeling
and
loving,
than
her
husband
knew.
They
gossiped
together
over
the
corpse,
related
anecdotes,
with
embellishments
of
her
lingering
decline,
and
its
real
or
supposed
cause.
In
short,
they
worked
each
other
up
to
some
indignation
against
the
austere
little
man,
who
sat
examining
papers
in
an
adjoining
room,
unconscious
of
what
opprobrium
he
was
the
object.
