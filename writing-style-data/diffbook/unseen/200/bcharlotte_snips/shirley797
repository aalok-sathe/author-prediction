with
decorous
dread
if
they
chanced
to
be
left
alone
with
their
audacious
cousin.
But,
as
I
have
said,
a
change
supervened.
Mr.
Sympson
was
appeased
and
his
family
tranquillized.
The
village
of
Nunnely
has
been
alluded
to
its
old
church,
its
forest,
its
monastic
ruins.
It
had
also
its
hall,
called
the
priory
an
older,
a
larger,
a
more
lordly
abode
than
any
Briarfield
or
Whinbury
owned;
and
what
is
more,
it
had
its
man
of
title
its
baronet,
which
neither
Briarfield
nor
Whinbury
could
boast.
This
possession
its
proudest
and
most
prized
had
for
years
been
nominal
only.
The
present
baronet,
a
young
man
hitherto
resident
in
a
distant
province,
was
unknown
on
his
Yorkshire
estate.
During
Miss
Keeldar's
stay
at
the
fashionable
watering
place
of
Cliffbridge,
she
and
her
friends
had
met
with
and
been
introduced
to
Sir
Philip
Nunnely.
They
encountered
him
again
and
again
on
the
sands,
the
cliffs,
in
the
various
walks,
sometimes
at
the
public
balls
of
the
place.
He
seemed
solitary.
His
manner
was
very
unpretending
too
simple
to
be
termed
affable;
rather
timid
than
proud.
He
did
not
condescend
to
their
society;
he
seemed
glad
of
it.
With
any
unaffected
individual
