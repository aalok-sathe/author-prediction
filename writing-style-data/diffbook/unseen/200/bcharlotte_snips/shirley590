number
of
soldiers
and
gentlemen
appeared
at
the
great
door
opening
into
the
yard,
they
quickly
stepped
aside
into
a
shed,
the
deposit
of
old
iron
and
timber,
whence
they
could
see
without
being
seen.
It
was
no
cheering
spectacle.
These
premises
were
now
a
mere
blot
of
desolation
on
the
fresh
front
of
the
summer
dawn.
All
the
copse
up
the
Hollow
was
shady
and
dewy,
the
hill
at
its
head
was
green;
but
just
here,
in
the
centre
of
the
sweet
glen,
Discord,
broken
loose
in
the
night
from
control,
had
beaten
the
ground
with
his
stamping
hoofs,
and
left
it
waste
and
pulverized.
The
mill
yawned
all
ruinous
with
unglazed
frames;
the
yard
was
thickly
bestrewn
with
stones
and
brickbats;
and
close
under
the
mill,
with
the
glittering
fragments
of
the
shattered
windows,
muskets
and
other
weapons
lay
here
and
there.
More
than
one
deep
crimson
stain
was
visible
on
the
gravel,
a
human
body
lay
quiet
on
its
face
near
the
gates,
and
five
or
six
wounded
men
writhed
and
moaned
in
the
bloody
dust.
Miss
Keeldar's
countenance
changed
at
this
view.
It
was
the
after
taste
of
the
battle,
death
and
pain
replacing
excitement
and
