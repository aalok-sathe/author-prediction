near
the
table.
I
looked
at
his
head.
He
has
plenty
of
hair;
on
the
temples
were
many
such
round
curls.
I
thought
he
could
spare
me
one.
I
knew
I
should
like
to
have
it,
and
I
asked
for
it.
He

"Caroline!"
"I

myself
a
fool,
Shirley,
in
some
respects;
I
do
despise

But
I
said
I
would
not
make
you
my
confessor,
for
you
cannot
reciprocate
