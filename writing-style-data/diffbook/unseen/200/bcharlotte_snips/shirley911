turned
her
eyes
from
the
encounter
of
your
own
lest
their
clearness
should
reveal
too
much;
supposing,
in
short,
your
Mary
had
been
not
cold,
but
modest;
not
vacant,
but
reflective;
not
obtuse,
but
sensitive;
not
inane,
but
innocent;
not
prudish,
but
pure,
would
you
have
left
her
to
court
another
woman
for
her
wealth?"
Mr.
Yorke

fervently,

you
would
wish
your
wife
to
love,
would
you
have
left
her?"
"Robert!"
he
lifted
his
arm,
he
held
it
suspended,
and
paused
"Robert!
this
is
a

world,
and
men
are
