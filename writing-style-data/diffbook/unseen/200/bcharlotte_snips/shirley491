in
Yorkshire?
What
more
conclusive
proof
could
be
given
that
he
was
better
than
anything
there?
And
yet
here
was
he
about
to
be
turned
like
a
dog
out
of
a
Yorkshire
garden!
Where,
under
such
circumstances,
was
the
"concatenation
accordingly"?
"Rid
me

closed
the
gates
on
him.
"How

the
pompous
priest
abuse
his
flock!
How
dare
the
lisping
cockney
revile
Yorkshire!"
was
her
sole
observation
on
the
circumstance,
as
she
returned
to
the
table.
Ere
long
the
little
party
broke
up;
Miss
Keeldar's
ruffled
and
darkened
brow,
curled
lip,
and
incensed
eye
gave
no
invitation
to
further
social
enjoyment.
The
fund
prospered.
By
dint
of
Miss
Keeldar's
