was
followed
by
him
from
the
room.
Their
brief
conference
took
place
in
the
hall.
"Have
you
employment
for
a
good
workman?"
asked
Moore.
"A
nonsense
question
in
these
times,
when
you
know
that
every
master
has
many
good
workmen
to
whom
he
cannot
give
full
employment."
"You
must
oblige
me
by
taking
on
this
man,
if

He
only

me
to
give
them
rather
more
time
to
make
my
changes
more
slowly.
You
know
I
cannot
do
that:
straitened
on
all
sides
as
I
am,
I
have
nothing
for
it
but
to
push
on.
I
thought
it
would
be
idle
to
palaver
long
with
them.
I
sent
them
away,
after
arresting
a
rascal
amongst
them,
