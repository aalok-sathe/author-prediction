a
smile,
half
corrective,
half
grateful.
The
slightest
possible
shake
of
the
head
delicately
marked
the
former
quality;
it
is
probable
a
gentle
pressure
indicated
the
latter.
"You
may
sit
where
you
can
now,
Mr.
Moore,"
said
Shirley,
also
smiling.
"You
see
there
is
not
an
inch
of
room
for
you
here;
but
I

space
at

Moore,

to
interchange
greetings
with
other
gentlemen
in

placeless
predicament;

bringing
with
him,
each
time
he
returned,
observations
it
was
necessary
to
whisper
in
her
ear.
Meantime
poor
Sam
Wynne
looked
far
from
comfortable.
His
fair
neighbour,
judging
from
her
movements,
appeared
in
a
mood
the
most
unquiet
and
unaccommodating.
She
would
not
sit
still
two
seconds.
She
was
hot;
she
fanned
herself;
complained
of
want
of
air
and
space.
She
remarked
that,
in
her
opinion,
when
people
had
finished
