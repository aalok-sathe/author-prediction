"If
you
wish
it."
"I
do
wish
it.
May
I
ask
whether
you
consider
life
valueless?"
"By
no
means.
On
the
contrary,
of
late
I
regard
my
life
as
invaluable."
"Of
late?"
"Existence
is
neither
aimless
nor

Fieldhead.
She

Some
gloomy
hours
had
she

in
the
interval.
Most

had
been

apartment,
only

meals,
and
anticipating
inquiries
