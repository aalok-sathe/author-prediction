indisposition;
and
still
as,
with
more
hurry
than
coherence,
she
again
and
again
enumerated
these
causes
of
exhaustion,
Caroline
gently
sought
to
relieve
her
by
opening
her
shawl
and
removing
her
bonnet.
Attentions
of
this
sort
Mrs.
Pryor
would
not
have
accepted
from
every
one.
In
general
she
recoiled
from
touch
or
close
approach
with
a
mixture
of
embarrassment
and
coldness
far
from
flattering

those
who
offered
her
aid.
To
Miss
Helstone's
little
light
hand,
however,
she
yielded

In
a
few
minutes
she
ceased
to
tremble,
and
grew

rarely
opened
her
lips,
or,
if
obliged
to
speak,
she
spoke
under
restraint,
and
consequently
not
well;
in
dialogue
she
was
a
good
converser.
Her
language,
always
a
little
formal,
was
well
chosen;
her
sentiments
were
just;
her
information
was
varied
and
correct.
Caroline
felt
it
pleasant
to
listen
to
her,
more
pleasant
than
she
could
have
anticipated.
On
the
wall
opposite
the
sofa
where
they
sat
hung
three
pictures
the
centre
one,
above
the
mantelpiece,
that
of
a
lady;
the
two
others,
