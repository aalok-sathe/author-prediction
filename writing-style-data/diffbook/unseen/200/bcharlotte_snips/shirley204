the
various
members
of
her
family;
the
missionary
and
Jew
baskets
and
their
contents;
the
late
meeting
at
Nunnely,
and
one
which
was
expected
to
come
off
next
week
at
Whinbury.
Tired
at
length
to
exhaustion,
she
embraced
the
opportunity
of
Mr.
Sweeting
coming
up
to
speak
to
Mrs.
Sykes
to
slip
quietly
out
of
the
apartment,
and
seek
a
moment's
respite

solitude.
She
repaired
to
the
dining
room,
where
the
clear

grate.
The
place
was
empty
and
quiet,
glasses
and
decanters
were
cleared
from
the

chairs
were
put

hearing,
her
vision
weary
with
listening
to
nothing,
and
gazing
on
vacancy.
As
to
her
mind,
that
flew
directly
to
the
Hollow.
It
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
parlour
there,
then
it
passed
to
the
counting
house,
and
wondered
which
spot
was
blessed
by
the
presence
of
Robert.
It
so
happened
that
neither
locality
had
that
honour;
for
Robert
was
half
a
mile
away
from
both,
