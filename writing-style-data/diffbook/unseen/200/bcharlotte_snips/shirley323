heart
might
welcome
her
presence
yet,
that
at
this
moment
he
might
be
willing
to
extend
his
hand
and
draw
her
to
him,
and
shelter
her
at
his
side
as
he
used
to
do.
That
night,
though
she
might
weep
as
usual,
she
would
fancy
her
tears
less
scalding;
the
pillow
they
watered
seemed
a
little
softer;
the
temples
pressed
to
that
pillow
ached
less.
The

from
the
Hollow
to

rectory
wound
near
a
certain
mansion,
the

under
whose

walls
Malone
passed
on
that
night
journey
mentioned
in
an
early
chapter
of
this
work
the
old
and
tenantless
dwelling
yclept
Fieldhead.
Tenantless
by
the
proprietor
it
had
been
for
ten
years,
but
it
was
no
ruin.
Mr.
Yorke
had
seen
it
kept
in
good
repair,
and
an
old
gardener
and
his
wife
had
lived
in
it,
cultivated
the
grounds,
and
maintained
the
house
in
habitable
condition.
If
Fieldhead
had
few
other
merits
as
a
building,
it
might
at
least
be
termed
picturesque.
Its
regular
architecture,
and
the
gray
and
mossy
colouring
communicated
by
time,
gave
it
a
just
claim
to
this
epithet.
