narrow
rules,
your
little
prejudices,
aversions,
dogmas,
bundle
them
off.
Mr.
Sympson,
go,
offer
them
a
sacrifice
to
the
deity
you
worship;
I'll
none
of
them.
I
wash
my
hands
of
the
lot.
I
walk
by
another
creed,
light,
faith,
and
hope
than
you."
"Another
creed!
I
believe
she
is
an
infidel."
"An
infidel
to
your
religion,
an
atheist
to
your
god."
"An
atheist!!!"
"Your
god,
sir,
is
the
world.
In
my
eyes
you
too,
if
not
an
infidel,
are
an
idolater.
I
conceive
that
you
ignorantly
worship;
in
all
things
you
appear
to
me
too
superstitious.
Sir,
your
god,
your
great
Bel,
your
fish
tailed
Dagon,
rises
before
me
as
a
demon.
You,
and
such
as
you,
have
raised
him
to
a
throne,
put
on
him
a
crown,
given
him
a
sceptre.
Behold
how
hideously
he
governs!
See
him
busied
at
the
work
he
likes
best
making
marriages.
He
binds
the
young
to
the
old,
the
strong
to
the
imbecile.
He
stretches
out
the
arm
of
Mezentius,
and
fetters
the
dead
to
the
living.
In
his
realm
there
is
hatred
secret
hatred;
there
is
disgust
unspoken
disgust;
there
is
treachery
family
treachery;
there
is
vice
deep,
deadly
domestic
vice.
