respectably,
how
handsomely
even,
they
have
contrived
to
clothe
themselves.
That
British
love
of
decency
will
work
miracles.
The
poverty
which
reduces
an
Irish
girl
to
rags
is
impotent
to
rob
the
English
girl
of
the
neat
wardrobe
she
knows
necessary
to
her
self
respect.
Besides,
the
lady
of
the
manor
that
Shirley,
now
gazing
with
pleasure
on
this
well
dressed
and
happy
looking
crowd

really
done

practicable
for

characters,
and
under
other
circumstances.
Caroline,
too,
is
pleased,
for
she
also
has
done
good
in
her
small
way
robbed
herself
of
more
than
one
dress,
ribbon,
or
collar
she
could
ill
spare,
to
aid
in
fitting
out
the
scholars
of
her
class;
and

she
could
not
give
money,
