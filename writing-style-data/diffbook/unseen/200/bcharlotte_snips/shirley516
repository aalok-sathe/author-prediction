defiled.
It
was
very
narrow
so
narrow
that
only
two
could
walk
abreast
without
falling
into
the
ditch
which
ran
along
each
side.
They
had
gained
the
middle
of
it,
when
excitement
became
obvious
in
the
clerical
commanders.
Boultby's
spectacles
and
Helstone's
Rehoboam
were
agitated;
the
curates
nudged
each
other;
Mr.
Hall
turned
to
the
ladies
and
smiled.
"What
is
the
matter?"
was
the
demand.
He
pointed
with
his
staff
to
the
end
of
the
lane
before
them.
Lo
and
behold!
another,
an
opposition,
procession
was
there
entering,
headed
also
by
men
in
black,
and
followed
also,
as
they
could
now
hear,
by
music.
"Is
it
our
double?"
asked
Shirley,
"our
manifold
wraith?
Here
is
a
card
turned
up."
"If
you
wanted
a
battle,
you
are
likely
to
get
one
at
least
of
looks,"
whispered
Caroline,
laughing.
"They
shall
not
pass
us!"
cried
the
curates
unanimously;
"we'll
not
give
way!"
"Give
way!"
retorted
Helstone
sternly,
turning
round;
"who
talks
of
giving
way?
You,
boys,
mind
what
you
are
about.
The
ladies,
I
know,
will
be
firm.
I
can
trust
them.
There
is
not
a
churchwoman
here
but
will
stand
her
ground
against
these
folks,
for
the
honour
of
the
Establishment.
