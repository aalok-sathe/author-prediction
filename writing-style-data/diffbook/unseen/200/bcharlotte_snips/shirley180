Moore
again
into
her
society.
He
had
walked
up
after
tea
more
than
once
to
pass
an
hour
with
her
uncle.
The
door
bell
had
rung,
his
voice
had
been
heard
in
the
passage
just
at
twilight,
when
she
little
expected
such
a
pleasure;
and
this
had
happened
twice
after
he
had
treated
her
with
peculiar
reserve;
and
though
he
rarely
talked
to

ennui,
the
occupation
was
insufferably
tedious;
she
opened
her
desk
and
attempted
to
write
a
French
composition
she
wrote
nothing
but
mistakes.
Suddenly
the
door
bell
sharply
rang;
her
heart
leaped;
she
sprang
to
the
drawing
room
door,
opened
it
softly,
peeped
through
the
aperture.
