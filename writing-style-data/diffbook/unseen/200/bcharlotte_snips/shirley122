quitted
the
room,
and
went
out
into
the
garden
ground
behind
the
mill.
A
sweet
fringe
of
young
verdure
and
opening
flowers
snowdrop,
crocus,
even
primrose
bloomed
in
the
sunshine
under
the
hot
wall
of
the
factory
Moore
plucked
here
and
there
a
blossom
and
leaf,
till
he
had
collected
a
little
bouquet.
He
returned
to
the
parlour,
pilfered
a
thread
of
silk
from
his
sister's
work
basket,
tied
the
flowers,
and
laid
them
on
Caroline's
desk.
"Now,
good
morning."
"Thank
you,
Robert.
It
is
pretty;
it
looks,
as
it
lies
there,
like
sparkles
of
sunshine
and
blue
sky.
Good
morning."
He
went
to
the
door,
stopped,
opened
his
lips
as
if
to
speak,
said
nothing,
and
moved
on.
He
passed
through
the
wicket,
and
mounted
his
horse.
In
a
second
he
had
flung
himself
from
his
saddle
again,
transferred
the
reins
to
Murgatroyd,
and
re
entered
the
cottage.
"I
forgot
my
gloves,"
he
said,
appearing
to
take
something
from
the
side
table;
then,
as
an
impromptu
thought,
he
remarked,
"You
have
no
binding
engagement
at
home
perhaps,
Caroline?"
"I
never
have.
Some
children's
socks,
which
Mrs.
Ramsden
has
ordered,
to
knit
for
the
Jew's
basket;
but
they
will
keep."
