"I
choose
to
doubt
their
truth."
"I
am
afraid
that
proves
you
are
already
caught."
"Not
I.
But
if
I
were,
do
you
know
what
soothsayers
I
would
consult?"
"Let
me
hear."
"Neither
man
nor
woman,
elderly
nor
young:
the
little
Irish
beggar
that
comes
barefoot
to
my
door;
the
mouse
that
steals
out
of
the
cranny
in
the
wainscot;
the
bird
that
in
frost
and
snow
pecks
at
my
window
for
a
crumb;
the
dog
that
licks
my
hand
and
sits
beside
my
knee."
"Did
you
ever
see
any
one
who
was
kind
to
such
things?"
"Did
you
ever
see
any
one
whom
such
things
seemed
instinctively
to
follow,
like,
rely
on?"
"We
have
a
black
cat
and
an
old
dog
at
the
rectory.
I
know
somebody
to
whose
knee
that
black
cat
loves
to
climb,
against
whose
shoulder
and
cheek
it
likes
to
purr.
The
old
dog
always
comes
out
of
his
kennel
and
wags
his
tail,
and
whines
affectionately
when
somebody
passes."
"And
what
does
that
somebody
do?"
"He
quietly
strokes
the
cat,
and
lets
her
sit
while
he
conveniently
can;
and
when
he
must
disturb
her
by
rising,
he
puts
her
softly
down,
and
never
flings
