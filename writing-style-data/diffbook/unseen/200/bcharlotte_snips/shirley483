and
nerves.
She
kept
close
to
me,
Miss
Keeldar,
the
rest
of
the
evening,
walking
with
me
over
the
grounds
where
the
children
were
playing;
she
followed
me
into
the
vestry
when
all
were
summoned
into
church;
she
would,
I
believe,
have
mounted
with
me
to
the
pulpit,
had
I
not
taken
the
previous
precaution
of
conducting
her
to
the
rectory
pew."
"And
he
has
been
my
friend
ever
since,"
said
Caroline.
"And
always
sat
at
her
table,
near
her
tray,
and
handed
the
cups
that
is
the
extent
of
my
services.
The
next
thing
I
do
for
her
will
be
to
marry
her
some
day
to
some
curate
or
mill
owner.
But
mind,
Caroline,
I
shall
inquire
about
the
bridegroom's
character;
and
if
he
is
not
a
gentleman
likely
to
render
happy
the
little
girl
who
walked
with
me
hand
in
hand
over
Nunnely
Common,
I
will
not
officiate.
So
take
care."
"The
caution
is
useless.
I
am
not
going
to
be
married.
I
shall
live
single,
like
your
sister
Margaret,
Mr.
Hall."
"Very
well.
You
might
do
worse.
Margaret
is
not
unhappy.
She
has
her
books
for
a
pleasure,
and
her
brother
for
a
care,
and
is
content.
