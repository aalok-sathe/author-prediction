and
unimpaired
even
by
esteem
for
her;
indeed
I
smiled
in
deep
secrecy
at
her
naivete
and
simplicity
in
being
the
first
to
love,
and
to
show
it.
That
whip
of
yours
seems
to
have
a
good
heavy
handle,
Yorke;
you
can
swing
it
about
your
head
and
knock
me
out
of
the
saddle,
if
you
choose.
I
should
rather
relish
a
loundering
whack."

in
her
a
powerful
magnet
to
my
interest
and
vanity.
I
never
felt
as
if
nature
meant
her
to
be
my
other
and
better
self.
When
a
question
on
that
head
rushed
upon
me,
I
flung
it

saying
brutally
