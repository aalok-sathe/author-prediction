him.
Mr.
Moore,
while
enjoying
the
genial
glow,
kept
his
eyes
directed
towards
the
glittering
brasses
on
the
shelf
above.
Chancing
for
an
instant
to
look
down,
his
glance
rested
on
an
uplifted
face,
flushed,
smiling,
happy,
shaded
with
silky
curls,
lit
with
fine
eyes.
Sarah
was
gone
into
the
parlour
with
the
tray;

lecture
from
her
mistress
detained
her
there.
Moore
placed

about
your
frames,
and
your
business,
and
the
war?"
"Not
just

"Are
you
positive
you
don't
feel
Hollow's
Cottage
too
small
for
you,
and
narrow,
and
dismal?"
"At
this
moment,
no."
"Can

affirm
that

are
not
bitter
at

because
rich
and
great
people
forget
you?"
"No
more
questions.
You
are
mistaken
if
you
think

am

curry
favour
with
