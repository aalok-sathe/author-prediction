Miss
Keeldar
even
this
negative
excuse
for
her
prejudice.
One
day
she
chanced
to
be
in
the
schoolroom
with
Henry
Sympson,
whose
amiable
and
affectionate
disposition
had
quickly
recommended
him
to
her
regard.
The
boy
was
busied
about
some
mechanical
contrivance;
his
lameness
made
him
fond
of
sedentary
occupation.
He
began
to
ransack
his
tutor's
desk
for
a
piece
of
wax
or
twine
necessary
to
his
work.
Moore
happened
to
be
absent.
Mr.
Hall,
indeed,
had
called
for
him
to
take
a
long
walk.
Henry
could
not
immediately
find
the
object
of
his
search.
He
rummaged
compartment
after
compartment;
and
at
last,
opening
an
inner
drawer,
he
came
upon
not
a
ball
of
cord
or
a
lump
of
beeswax,
but
a
little
bundle
of
small
marble
coloured
cahiers,
tied
with
tape.
Henry
looked
at
them.
"What
rubbish
Mr.
Moore
stores
up
in
his
desk!"
he
said.
"I
hope
he
won't
keep
my
old
exercises
so
carefully."
"What
is
it?"
"Old
copy
books."
He
threw
the
bundle
to
Caroline.
The
packet
looked
so
neat
externally
her
curiosity
was
excited
to
see
its
contents.
"If
they
are
only
copy
books,
I
suppose
I
may
open
them?"
"Oh
yes,
quite
freely.

Moore's
