again
into
the
heaven
whence
thou
wert
sent."
That
Presence,
invisible
but
mighty,
gathered
her
in
like
a
lamb
to
the
fold;
that
voice,
soft
but
all
pervading,
vibrated
through
her
heart
like
music.
Her
eye
received
no
image;
and
yet
a
sense
visited
her
vision
and
her
brain
as
of
the
serenity
of
stainless
air,
the
power
of
sovereign
seas,
the
majesty
of
marching
stars,
the
energy
of
colliding
elements,
the
rooted
endurance
of
hills
wide
based,
and,
above
all,
as
of
the
lustre
of
heroic
beauty
rushing
victorious
on
the
Night,
vanquishing
its
shadows
like
a
diviner
sun.
Such
was
the
bridal
hour
of
Genius
and
Humanity.
Who
shall
rehearse
the
tale
of
their
after
union?
Who
shall
depict
its
bliss
and
bale?
Who
shall
tell
how
He
between
whom
and
the
Woman
God
put
enmity
forged
deadly
plots
to
break
the
bond
or
defile
its
purity?
Who
shall
record
the
long
strife
between
Serpent
and
Seraph:
How
still
the
Father
of
Lies
insinuated
evil
into
good,
pride
into
wisdom,
grossness
into
glory,
pain
into
bliss,
poison
into
passion?
How
the
"dreadless
Angel"
defied,
resisted,
and
repelled?
How
again
and
again
he
refined
the
polluted
cup,
exalted
the
