Nobody
else
not
one
living
thing
had
ever
so
claimed
her
services,
so
looked
for
help
at
her
hand.
Other
people
were
always
more
or
less
reserved
and
stiff
with
her,
as
she
was
reserved
and
stiff
with
them;
other
people
betrayed
consciousness
of
and
annoyance
at
her
weak
points.
Caroline
no
more
showed
such
wounding
sagacity
or
reproachful
sensitiveness
now
than
she
had
done
when
a
suckling
of
three
months
old.
Yet
Caroline
could
find
fault.
Blind
to
the
constitutional
defects
that
were
incurable,
she
had
her
eyes
wide
open
to
the
acquired
habits
that
were
susceptible
of
remedy.
On
certain
points
she
would
quite
artlessly
lecture
her
parent;
and
that
parent,
instead
of
being
hurt,
felt
a
sensation
of
pleasure
in
discovering
that
the
girl
dared
lecture
her,
that
she
was
so
much
at
home
with
her.
"Mamma,
I
am
determined
you
shall
not
wear
that
old
gown
any
more.
Its
fashion
is
not
becoming;
it
is
too
strait
in
the
skirt.
You
shall
put
on
your
black
silk
every
afternoon.
In
that
you
look
nice;
it
suits
you.
And
you
shall
have
a
black
satin
dress
for
Sundays
a
real
satin,
not
a
satinet
or
any
of
