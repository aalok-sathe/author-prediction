the
wisdom
in
the
world
is
lodged
in
male
skulls?"
"I
think
that
women
are
a
kittle
and
a
froward
generation;
and
I've
a
great
respect
for
the
doctrines
delivered
in
the
second
chapter
of
St.
Paul's
first
Epistle
to
Timothy."
"What
doctrines,
Joe?"
"'Let
the
woman
learn
in
silence,
with
all
subjection.
I
suffer
not
a
woman
to
teach,
nor
to
usurp
authority
over
the
man,
but
to
be
in
silence.
For
Adam
was
first
formed,
then
Eve.'"
"What
has
that
to
do
with
the
business?"
interjected
Shirley.
"That
smacks
of
rights
of
primogeniture.
I'll
bring
it
up
to
Mr.
Yorke
the
first
time
he
inveighs
against
those
rights."
"And,"
continued
Joe
Scott,
"Adam
was
not
deceived,
but
the
woman
being
deceived
was
in
the
transgression."
"More
shame
to
Adam
to
sin
with
his
eyes
open!"
cried
Miss
Keeldar.
"To
confess
the
honest
truth,
Joe,
I
never
was
easy
in
my
mind
concerning
that
chapter.
It
puzzles
me."
"It
is
very
plain,
miss.
He
that
runs
may
read."
"He
may
read
it
in
his
own
fashion,"
remarked
Caroline,
now
joining
in
the
dialogue
for
the
first
time.
"You
allow
the
right
of
private
judgment,
I
suppose,
Joe?"
"My
certy,
