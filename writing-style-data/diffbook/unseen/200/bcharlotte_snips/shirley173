Helstone;
"I
was
little
acquainted
with
her.
I
have
not
heard
from
her
for
years:
but
wherever
she
is,
she
thinks
nothing
of
you;
she
never
inquires
about
you.
I
have
reason
to
believe
she
does
not
wish
to
see
you.
Come,
it
is
school
time.
You
go
to
your
cousin
at
ten,
don't
you?
The
clock
has
struck."
Perhaps
Caroline
would
have
said
more;
but
Fanny,
coming
in,
informed
her
master
that
the
churchwardens
wanted
to
speak
to

on

premises,
in
his
vicinage,
revived
her
somewhat
depressed
spirits
quickly.
Arriving
in
sight
of
the
white
house,
and
within
hearing
of
the
thundering
mill
and
its
rushing
watercourse,
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
Moore
at
his
garden
gate.
There
he
stood,
in
his
belted
Holland
blouse,
a
light
cap
covering
his
head,
which
undress
costume
suited
him.
He
was
looking
down
the
lane,
not

the
direction
of
his
cousin's
