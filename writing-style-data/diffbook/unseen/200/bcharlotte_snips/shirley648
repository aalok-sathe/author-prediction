if
a
rude
finger
had
pressed
a
naked
nerve.
Caroline
felt
she
had
touched
what
would
not
bear
the
slightest
contact.
"My
marriage
was
unhappy,"
said
the
lady,
summoning
courage
at
last;
"but
yet
"
She
hesitated.
"But
yet,"
suggested
Caroline,
"not
immitigably
wretched?"
"Not
in
its
results,
at
least.
No,"
she
added,
in
a
softer
tone;
"God
mingles
something

a
duplicate
or
likely
to
assimilate
with
a
contrast.
I
was
quite
aware
of
my
own
ineligibility;
and
if
I
had
not
been
so
miserable
as
a
governess,
I
never
should
have
married;
and
then
"
Caroline's
eyes
asked
her
to
proceed.
They
entreated
her
to
break
the
thick
cloud
of
despair
