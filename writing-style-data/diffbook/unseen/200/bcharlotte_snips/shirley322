resting
place
was
at
a
certain
stile
under
a
certain
old
thorn.
Thence
she
could
look
down
on
the
cottage,
the
mill,
the
dewy
garden
ground,
the
still,
deep
dam;
thence
was
visible
the
well
known
counting
house
window,
from
whose
panes
at
a
fixed
hour
shot,
suddenly
bright,
the
ray
of
the
well
known
lamp.
Her
errand
was
to
watch
for
this
ray,
her
reward
to
catch
it,
sometimes
sparkling
bright
in
clear
air,
sometimes
shimmering
dim
through
mist,
and

flashing
broken
between
slant
lines

nights
when

promise
of
some
indefinite
hope.
If,
while
she
gazed,
a
shadow
bent
between
the
light
and
lattice,
her
heart
leaped.
That
eclipse
was
Robert;
she
had
seen
him.
She
would
return
home
comforted,
carrying
in
her
mind
a
clearer
vision
of
his
aspect,
a
distincter
recollection
of
his
voice,
his
smile,
his
bearing;
and
blent
with
these
impressions
was
often
a
sweet
persuasion
that,
if
she
could
get
near
him,
