can
remember
the
old
mill
being
built
the
very
first
it
was
in
all
the
district;
and
then
I
can
remember
it
being
pulled
down,
and
going
with
my
lake
lasses
[companions]
to
see
the
foundation
stone
of
the
new
one
laid.
The
two
Mr.
Moores
made
a
great
stir
about
it.
They
were
there,
and
a

of
fine
folk
besides,
and

Mrs.
Louis
was
the
grandest;
she
always
wore
such
handsome

a
body
through.
There
is
no
such
ladies
nowadays."

now;
but
I
can
tell
of
it
clean
different
again,
when
there
was
neither
mill,
nor
cot,
nor
hall,
except
Fieldhead,
within
two
miles
of
it.
I
can
tell,
one
summer
evening,
fifty
years
syne,
my
mother
coming
running
in
just
at
the
edge
of
dark,
almost
fleyed
out
of
her
wits,
saying
she
had
seen
a
fairish
[fairy]
in
Fieldhead
Hollow;
and
that
was
the
last
fairish
