the
church,
carrying
in
his
arms
an
infant
a
robust,
ruddy
little
boy
of
some
two
years
old
roaring
with
all
the
power
of
his
lungs.
He
had
probably
just
awaked
from
a
church
sleep.
Two
little
girls,
of
nine
and
ten,
followed.
The
influence
of
the
fresh
air,
and
the
attraction
of
some
flowers
gathered
from
a
grave,
soon
quieted
the
child.
The
man
sat
down
with
him,
dandling
him
on
his
knee
as
tenderly
as
any
woman;
the
two
little
girls
took
their
places
one
on
each
side.
"Good
evening,
William,"
said
Shirley,
after
due
scrutiny
of
the
man.
He
had
seen
her
before,
and
apparently
was
waiting
to
be
recognized.
He
now
took
off
his
hat,
and
grinned
a
smile
of
pleasure.
He
was
a
rough
headed,
hard
featured
personage,
not
old,
but
very
weather
beaten.
His
attire
was
decent
and
clean;
that
of
his
children
singularly
neat.
It
was
our
old
friend
Farren.
The
young
ladies
approached
him.
"You
are
not
going
into
the
church?"
he
inquired,
gazing
at
them
complacently,
yet
with
a
mixture
of
bashfulness
in
his
look
a
sentiment
not
by
any
means
the
result
of
awe
of
their
station,
but
only
of
