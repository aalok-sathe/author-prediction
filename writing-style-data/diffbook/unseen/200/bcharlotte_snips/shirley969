be
taken
off.
He
had
been
hurt;
he
was
the
youngest
and
slightest.
He
was
quite
cool,
in
no
passion;
he
even
smiled,
content
that
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
labour
he
had
set
himself
was
over.
Once
he
seemed
to
flag
in
the
course
of
the
morning.
"It
is
not
worth
while
to
bother
myself
for
that
Caroline,"
he
remarked.
But
a
quarter

Now

That
lady
was
just
comfortably
settled
to
stocking
mending
in
the
back
parlour,
when
Martin
laying
down
a
book
which,
stretched
on
the
sofa
(he
was
still
indisposed,
according
to
his
own
account),
he
had
been
perusing
in
all
the
voluptuous
ease
of
a
yet
callow
pacha
lazily
introduced
some
discourse
about
Sarah,
the
maid
at
the
Hollow.
In
the
course
of
much
verbal
meandering
he
insinuated
