pastry,
and
ham
on
the
shelves
of
the
larder."
She
stopped,
then
went
on,
"Mother,
the
Lord
who
gave
each
of
us
our
talents
will
come
home
some
day,
and
will
demand
from
all
an
account.
The
teapot,
the
old
stocking
foot,
the
linen
rag,
the
willow
pattern
tureen
will
yield
up
their
barren
deposit
in
many
a
house.
Suffer
your
daughters,
at

to

they
may
be

at
the
Master's

ten
minutes,
her
mother
asked,
"Do
you
think
yourself

a
victim?"
"No,
mother."
"Yet,
as
far
as
I
understood
your
tirade,
it
was
a
protest
against
all
womanly
and
domestic
employment."
"You
misunderstood
it,
mother.
I
should
be
sorry
not
to
learn
to
sew.
You
do
right
to
teach
me,
and
to
make
me
work."
"Even
to
the
mending
of
your
brothers'
stockings
and
the
making
of
sheets?"
"Yes."
"Where

the
use
of
