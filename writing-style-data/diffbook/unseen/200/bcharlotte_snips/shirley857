no
hurry
to
rejoin
them.
As
I
stood
leaning
against
the
gate
pillar,
thinking
some
very
happy
thoughts
about
my
future
life
for
that
morning
I
imagined
that
events
were
beginning
to
turn
as
I
had
long
wished
them
to
turn
"
"Ah!
Nunnely
had
been
with
her
the
evening
before!"
thought
Moore
parenthetically.
"I
heard
a
panting
sound;
a
dog
came
running
up
the
lane.
I
know
most
of
the
dogs
in
this
neighbourhood.
It

pointers.
The
poor
creature
ran

flurried
to
know
me;
and
when
I
attempted
to
pat
her
head,
she
turned
and
snatched
at
my
arm.
She
bit
it
so
as
to
draw
blood,
then
ran
panting
on.
Directly
after,
Mr.
Wynne's
keeper
came
up,
carrying
a
gun.
He
asked
if
I
had
seen
a
dog.
I
told
him
I
had
seen
Pheabe.
