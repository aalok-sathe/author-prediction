singing
softly,
she
listened.
This
was
the
strain:
"Obscurest
night
involved
the
sky,
The
Atlantic
billows
roared,
When
such
a
destined
wretch
as
I,
Washed
headlong
from
on
board,
Of
friends,
of
hope,
of
all
bereft,
His
floating
home
for
ever
left."
Here
the
fragment
stopped,
because
Shirley's
song,
erewhile
somewhat
full
and
thrilling,
had
become
delicately
faint.
"Go
on,"
said
she.
"Then
you
go
on
too.
I
was
only
repeating
'The
Castaway.'"
"I
know.
If
you
can
remember
it
all,
say
it
all."
And
as
it
was
nearly
dark,
and,
after
all,
Miss
Keeldar
was
no
formidable
auditor,
Caroline
went
through
it.
She
went
through
it
as
she
should
have
gone
through
it.
The
wild
sea,
the
drowning
mariner,
the
reluctant
ship
swept
on
in
the
storm,
you
heard
were
realized
by
her;
and
more
vividly
was
realized
the
heart
of
the
poet,
who
did
not
weep
for
"The
Castaway,"
but
who,
in
an
hour
of
tearless
anguish,
traced
a
semblance
to
his
own
God
abandoned
misery
in
the
fate
of
that
man
forsaken
sailor,
and
cried
from
the
depths
where
he
struggled,
"No
voice
divine
the
storm
allayed,
No
light
propitious
shone,
When,
snatched
from
all
effectual
aid,
