not
certain.
Commonplace
young
ladies
can
be
quite
as
hard
as
commonplace
young
gentlemen
quite
as
worldly
and
selfish.
Those
who
suffer
should
always
avoid
them.
Grief
and
calamity
they
despise;
they
seem
to
regard
them
as
the
judgments
of
God
on
the
lowly.
With
them,
to
"love"
is
merely
to
contrive
a
scheme
for
achieving
a
good
match;
to
be
"disappointed"
is
to
have
their
scheme
seen
through
and
frustrated.
They
think
the
feelings
and
projects
of
others
on
the
subject
of
love
similar
to
their
own,
and
judge
them
accordingly.
All
this
Caroline
knew,
partly
by
instinct,
partly
by
observation.
She
regulated
her
conduct
by
her
knowledge,
keeping
her
pale
face
and
wasted
figure
as
much
out
of
sight
as
she
could.
Living
thus
in
complete
seclusion,
she
ceased
to
receive
intelligence
of
the
little
transactions
of
the
neighbourhood.
One
morning
her
uncle
came
into
the
parlour,
where
she
sat
endeavouring
to
find
some
pleasure
in
painting
a
little
group
of
wild
flowers,
gathered
under
a
hedge
at
the
top
of
the
Hollow
fields,
and
said
to
her
in
his
abrupt
manner,
"Come,
child,
you
are
always
stooping
over
palette,
or
book,
or
sampler;
leave
that
tinting
work.
