at
his
bedside,
shut
up
alone
with
him
in
his
chamber,
they
wrought
and
wrangled
over
his
exhausted
frame.
They
three
were
on
one
side
of
the
bed,
and
Death
on
the
other.
The
conflict
was
sharp;
it
lasted
till
day
broke,
when
the
balance
between
the
belligerents
seemed
so
equal
that
both
parties
might
have
claimed
the
victory.
At
dawn
Graves
and
young
MacTurk
were
left
in
charge

the
patient,

the
senior
went
himself
in

bedhead.
That
moment
she
began
her
reign.
Mrs.
Horsfall
had
one
virtue
orders
received
from
MacTurk

obeyed

the
letter.
The
ten
commandments
were
less
binding
in
her
eyes
than
her
surgeon's
dictum.
In
other
respects
she
was
no
woman,
but
a
dragon.
Hortense
Moore
fell
effaced
before
her;
Mrs.
Yorke
withdrew
crushed;
yet
both
these
women
were
personages
of
some
dignity

their
own
estimation,
