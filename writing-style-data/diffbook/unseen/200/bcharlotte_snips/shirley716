summoned,
sneered
at
the
hypochondriac
fancies
of
the
rich
and
idle,
who,
she
said,
having
nothing
but
themselves
to
think
about,
must
needs
send
for
a
doctor
if
only
so
much
as
their
little
finger
ached.
The
"rich
and
idle,"
represented
in
the
person
of
Caroline,
were
meantime
falling
fast
into
a
condition
of
prostration,
whose
quickly
consummated
debility
puzzled
all
who
witnessed
it
except
one;
for
that
one
alone
reflected
how
liable
is
the
undermined
structure
to
sink
in
sudden
ruin.
Sick
people
often
have
fancies
inscrutable
to
ordinary
attendants,
and
Caroline
had
one
which
even
her
tender
nurse
could
not
at
first
explain.
On
a
certain
day
in
the
week,
at
a
certain
hour,
she
would
whether
worse
or
better
entreat
to
be
taken
up
and
dressed,
and
suffered
to
sit
in
her
chair
near
the
window.
This
station
she
would
retain
till
noon
was
past.
Whatever
degree
of
exhaustion
or
debility
her
wan
aspect
betrayed,
she
still
softly
put
off
all
persuasion
to
seek
repose
until
the
church
clock
had
duly
tolled
midday.
The
twelve
strokes
sounded,
she
grew
docile,
and
would
meekly
lie
down.
Returned
to
the
couch,
she
usually
buried
her
face
deep
in
the
