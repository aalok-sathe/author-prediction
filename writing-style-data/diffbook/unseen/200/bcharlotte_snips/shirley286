the
robber's
throat,
and
there
they
would
have
fastened,
and
there
hung,
inveterate,
insatiable,
till
the
treasure
had
been
restored.
Tradesmen,
when
they
speak
against
war,
always
profess
to
hate
it
because
it
is
a
bloody
and
barbarous
proceeding.
You
would
think,
to
hear
them
talk,
that
they
are
peculiarly
civilized
especially
gentle
and
kindly
of
disposition
to
their
fellow
men.
This
is
not
the
case.
Many
of
them
are
extremely
narrow
and
cold
hearted;
have
no
good
feeling
for
any
class
but
their
own;
are
distant,
even
hostile,
to
all
others;
call
them
useless;
seem
to
question
their
right
to
exist;
seem
to
grudge
them
the
very
air
they
breathe,
and
to
think
the
circumstance
of
their
eating,
drinking,
and
living
in
decent
houses
quite
unjustifiable.
They
do
not
know
what
others
do
in
the
way
of
helping,
pleasing,
or
teaching
their
race;
they
will
not
trouble
themselves
to
inquire.
Whoever
is
not
in
trade
is
accused
of
eating
the
bread
of
idleness,
of
passing
a
useless
existence.
Long
may
it
be
ere
England
really
becomes
a
nation
of
shop
keepers!
We
have
already
said
that
Moore
was
no

patriot,

we

also
explained
what
