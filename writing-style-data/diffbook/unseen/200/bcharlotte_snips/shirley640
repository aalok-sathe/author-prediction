graces;'
that
all
their
hearts
were
regenerate,
and
their
spirits
in
a
peculiar
state
of
discipline.
I
was
early
given
to
understand
that
'as
I
was
not
their
equal,'
so
I
could
not
expect
'to
have
their
sympathy.'
It
was
in
no
sort
concealed
from
me
that
I
was
held
a
'burden
and
a
restraint
in
society.'
The
gentlemen,
I
found,
regarded
me
as
a
'tabooed
woman,'
to
whom
'they
were
interdicted
from
granting
the
usual
privileges
of
the
sex,'
and
yet
'who
annoyed
them
by
frequently
crossing
their
path.'
The
ladies
too
made
it
plain
that
they
thought
me
'a
bore.'
The
servants,
it
was
signified,
'detested
me;'
why,
I
could
never
clearly
comprehend.
My
pupils,
I
was
told,
'however
much
they
might
love
me,
and
how
deep
soever
the
interest
I
might
take
in
them,
could
not
be
my
friends.'
It
was
intimated
that
I
must
'live
alone,
and
never
transgress
the
invisible
but
rigid
line
which
established
the
difference
between
me
and
my
employers.'
My
life
in
this
house
was
sedentary,
solitary,
constrained,
joyless,
toilsome.
The
dreadful
crushing
of
the
animal
spirits,
the
ever
prevailing
sense
of
friendlessness
and
homelessness
consequent
on
this
state
of
things
began
