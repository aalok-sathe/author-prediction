and
you
would
be
answered
by
sarcasm.
Here
he
is,
wandering
alone,
waiting
duteously
on
Nature,
while
she
unfolds
a
page
of
stern,
of
silent,
and
of
solemn
poetry
beneath
his
attentive
gaze.
Being
seated,
he
takes
from
his
satchel
a
book
not
the
Latin
grammar,
but
a
contraband
volume
of
fairy
tales.
There
will
be
light
enough
yet
for
an
hour
to
serve
his
keen
young
vision.
Besides,
the
moon
waits
on
him;
her
beam,
dim
and
vague
as
yet,
fills
the
glade
where
he
sits.
He
reads.
He
is
led
into
a
solitary
mountain
region;
all
round
him
is
rude
and
desolate,
shapeless,
and
almost
colourless.
He
hears
bells
tinkle
on
the
wind.
Forth
riding
from
the
formless
folds
of
the
mist
dawns
on
him
the
brightest
vision
a
green
robed
lady,
on
a
snow
white
palfrey.
He
sees
her
dress,
her
gems,
and
her
steed.
She
arrests
him
with
some
mysterious
question.
He
is
spell
bound,
and
must
follow
her
into
fairyland.
A
second
legend
bears
him
to
the
sea
shore.
There
tumbles
in
a
strong
tide,
boiling
at
the
base
of
dizzy
cliffs.
It
rains
and
blows.
A
reef
of
rocks,
black
and
rough,
stretches
far
