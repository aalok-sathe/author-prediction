a
blind,
weak
fool,
and
you
are
acute
and
sensible,
Shirley.
I
will
go
with
you;
I
will
gladly
go
with
you!"
"I
do
not
doubt
it.
You
would
die
blindly
and
meekly
for
me,
but
you
would
intelligently
and
gladly
die
for
Moore.
But,
in
truth,
there
is
no
question
of
death
to
night;
we
run
no
risk
at
all."
Caroline
rapidly
closed
shutter
and
lattice.
"Do
not

that
I
shall
not
have

as
you
can
possibly
run,
Shirley.
Take
my

Let

They

Many

checked
but
did
not
baffle
them.
Shirley
was
surefooted
and
agile;
she
could
spring
like
a
deer
when
she
chose.
Caroline,
more
timid
and
less
dexterous,
fell
once
or
twice,
and
bruised
herself;
but
she
rose
again
directly,
saying
she
was
not
hurt.
A
quickset
hedge
bounded
the
last
field;
they
lost
time
in
seeking
a
gap
in
it.
The
aperture,
when
found,
was
narrow,
but
