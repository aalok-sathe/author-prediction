health
on
your
cheek
and
hope
in
your
eye
is
pleasant,
Cary;
but
what
is
this
hope,
and
what
is
the
source
of
this
sunshine
I
perceive
about
you?"
"For
one
thing,
I
am
happy
in
mamma.
I
love
her
so
much,
and
she
loves
me.
Long
and
tenderly
she
nursed
me.
Now,
when
her
care
has

ripe

judgment,
rich

information,
exhaustless
in
stores

amassed.
Every
day
that
I
live
with
her
I
like
her
better,
I
esteem
her
more
highly,
I
love
her
more
tenderly."
"That
for
one
thing,
then,
Cary.
You
talk
in
