personage
whom
I
might
describe
minutely,
but
I
feel
no
vocation
to
the
task.
I
see
her,
though,
very
plainly
before
me
a
large
woman
of
the
gravest
aspect,
care
on
her
front
and
on
her
shoulders,
but
not
overwhelming,
inevitable
care,
rather
the
sort
of
voluntary,
exemplary
cloud
and
burden
people
ever
carry
who
deem
it
their
duty
to
be
gloomy.
Ah,
well
a
day!
Mrs.
Yorke
had
that
notion,
and
grave
as
Saturn
she
was,
morning,
noon,
and,
night;
and
hard
things
she
thought
if
any
unhappy
wight
especially
of
the
female
sex
who
dared
in
her
presence
to
show
the
light
of
a
gay
heart
on
a
sunny
countenance.
In
her
estimation,
to
be
mirthful
was
to
be
profane,
to
be
cheerful
was
to
be
frivolous.
She
drew
no
distinctions.
Yet
she
was
a
very
good
wife,
a
very
careful
mother,
looked
after
her
children
unceasingly,
was
sincerely
attached
to
her
husband;
only
the
worst
of
it
was,
if
she
could
have
had
her
will,
she
would
not
have
permitted
him
to
have
any
friend
in
the
world
beside
herself.
All
his
relations
were
insupportable
to
her,
and
she
kept
them
at
arm's
length.
Mr.
Yorke
and
