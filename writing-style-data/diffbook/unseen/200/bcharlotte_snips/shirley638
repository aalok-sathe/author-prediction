Mrs.
Pryor
could
not
complete
her
broken
sentences;
she
could
not
manage
to
put
the
question
whether
Mr.
Helstone
was
too
harsh
with
his
niece.
But
Caroline
comprehended.
"Oh,
that
is
nothing,"
she
replied.
"My
uncle
and
I
get
on
very
well.
We
never
quarrel
I
don't
call
him
harsh
he
never
scolds
me.
Sometimes
I
wish
somebody
in
the
world
loved
me,
but
I
cannot
say
that
I
particularly
wish
him
to
have
more
affection
for
me
than
he
has.
As
a
child,
I
should
perhaps
have
felt
the
want
of
attention,
only
the
servants
were
very
kind
to
me;
but
when
people
are
long
indifferent
to
us,
we
grow
indifferent
to
their
indifference.
It
is
my
uncle's
way
not
to
care
for
women
and
girls,
unless
they
be
ladies
that
he
meets
in
company.
He
could
not
alter,
and
I
have
no
wish
that
he
should
alter,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned.
I
believe
it
would
merely
annoy
and
frighten
me
were
he
to
be
affectionate
towards
me
now.
But
you
know,
Mrs.
Pryor,
it
is
scarcely
living
to
measure
time
as
I
do
at
the
rectory.
The
hours
pass,
and
I
get
them
over
