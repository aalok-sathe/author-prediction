but
to
rent
a
cloth
mill
in
an
out
of
the
way
nook
of
an
out
of
the
way
district;
to
take
a
cottage
adjoining
it
for
his
residence,
and
to
add
to
his
possessions,
as
pasture
for
his
horse,
and
space
for
his
cloth
tenters,
a
few
acres
of
the
steep,
rugged
land
that
lined
the
hollow
through
which
his
mill
stream
brawled.
All
this
he
held
at
a
somewhat
high
rent
(for
these
war
times
were
hard,
and
everything
was
dear)
of
the
trustees
of
the
Fieldhead
estate,
then
the
property
of
a
minor.
At
the
time
this
history
commences,
Robert
Moore
had
lived
but
two
years
in
the
district,
during
which
period
he
had
at
least
proved
himself
possessed
of
the
quality
of
activity.
The
dingy
cottage
was
converted
into
a
neat,
tasteful
residence.
Of
part
of
the
rough
land
he
had
made
garden
ground,
which
he
cultivated
with
singular,
even
with
Flemish,
exactness
and
care.
As
to
the
mill,
which
was
an
old
structure,
and
fitted
up
with
old
machinery,
now
become
inefficient
and
out
of
date,
he
had
from
the
first
evinced
the
strongest
contempt
for
all
its
arrangements
and
appointments.
His
aim
had
been
