is
two
months,
I
should
think,
Caroline,
since
you
were
at
the
cottage."
"Since
I
was
within
it
yes."
"Have
you
ever
passed
that
way
in
your
walk?"
"I
have
come
to
the
top
of
the
fields
sometimes
of
an
evening
and
looked
down.
Once
I
saw
Hortense
in
the
garden
watering
her
flowers,
and
I
know

"Did
I?
I

not
see

Was
I
alone?"
"I
saw
you
twice,
and
neither
time
were
you
alone."
"Who
was
my
companion?
Probably
nothing
but
Joe
Scott,
or
my
own
shadow
by
moonlight."
"No;
neither
Joe
Scott
nor
your
shadow,
Robert.
