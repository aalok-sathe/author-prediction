niece.
Shirley,
who
could
never
find
it
in
her
heart
to
be
or
to
seem
inhospitable
(except
in
the
single
instance
of
Mr.
Donne),
begged
the
whole
party
to
stay
a
little
longer.
She
begged
in
such
earnest
it
was
evident
she
wished
it
for
some
reason.
They
took
her
at
her
word.
Indeed,
the
uncle
could
not
bring
himself
to
leave
her
quite
unwatched
at
full
liberty
to
marry
Robert
Moore
as
soon
as
that
gentleman
should
be
able
(Mr.
Sympson
piously
prayed
this
might
never
be
the
case)
to
reassert
his
supposed
pretensions
to
her
hand.
They
all
stayed.
In
his
first
rage
against
all
the
house
of
Moore,
Mr.
Sympson
had
so
conducted
himself
towards
Mr.
Louis
that
that
gentleman
patient
of
labour
or
suffering,
but
intolerant
of
coarse
insolence
had
promptly
resigned
his
post,
and
could
now
be
induced
to
resume
and
retain
it
only
till
such
time
as
the
family
should
quit
Yorkshire.
Mrs.
Sympson's
entreaties
prevailed
with
him
thus
far;
his
own
attachment
to
his
pupil
constituted
an
additional
motive
for
concession;
and
probably
he
had
a
third
motive,
stronger
than
either
of
the
other
two.
Probably
he
would
have
found
it
very
hard
