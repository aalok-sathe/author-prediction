played
the
flute
and
sang
hymns
like
a
seraph,
some
young
ladies
of
his
parish
thought;
sneered
at
as
"the
ladies'
pet;"
teased
about
his
mamma
and
sisters,
for
whom
poor
Mr.
Sweeting
had
some
lingering
regard,
and
of
whom
he
was
foolish
enough
now
and
then
to
speak
in
the
presence
of
the
priestly
Paddy,
from
whose
anatomy
the
bowels
of
natural
affection
had
somehow
been
omitted.
The
victims
met
these
attacks
each
in
his
own
way:
Mr.
Donne
with
a
stilted
self
complacency
and
half
sullen
phlegm,
the
sole
props

otherwise
somewhat

Sweeting
with
the
indifference
of
a
light,
easy
disposition,
which
never
professed
to
have
any
dignity
to
maintain.
When
Malone's
raillery
became
rather
too
offensive,
which
it
soon
did,
they
joined,
in
an
attempt
to
turn
the
tables
on
him
by
asking
him
how
many
boys
had
shouted
"Irish
Peter!"
after
him
as
he
came
along
the
road
that
day
(Malone's
name
was
Peter
the
Rev.
Peter
Augustus
Malone);
requesting
to
be
informed
whether
it
was
the
mode
in
Ireland
for
clergymen
to
carry
loaded
pistols
in
their
pockets,
and
a
shillelah
in
their
hands,
when
they
made
pastoral
visits;
