Keeldar?
Have
you
been
with
me
in
spirit
when
I
did
not
see
you?
Have
you
entered
into
my
day
dreams,
and
beheld
my
brain
labouring
at
its
scheme
of
a
future?'
"She
had
separated
a
slip
of
paper
for
lighting
tapers
a
spill,
as
it
is
called
into
fragments.
She
threw
morsel
by
morsel
into
the
fire,
and
stood
pensively
watching
them
consume.
She
did
not
speak.
"'How
did
you
learn
what
you
seem
to
know
about
my
intentions?'
"'I
know
nothing.
I
am
only
discovering
them
now.
I
spoke
at
hazard.'
"'Your
hazard
sounds
like
divination.
A
tutor
I
will
never
be
again;
never
take
a
pupil
after
Henry
and
yourself;
not
again
will
I
sit
habitually
at
another
man's
table
no
more
be
the
appendage
of
a
family.
I
am
now
a
man
of
thirty;
I
have
never
been
free
since
I
was
a
boy
of
ten.
I
have
such
a
thirst
for
freedom,
such
a
deep
passion
to
know
her
and
call
her
mine,
such
a
day
desire
and
night
longing
to
win
her
and
possess
her,
I
will
not
refuse
to
cross
the
Atlantic
for
her
sake;
her
I
will
follow
deep
into
virgin
woods.
