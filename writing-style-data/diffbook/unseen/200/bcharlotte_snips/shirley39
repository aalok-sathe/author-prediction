two
tumblers.
He
then
produced
a
small
copper
kettle
still
from
the
same
well
stored
recess,
his
cupboard
filled
it
with
water
from
a
large
stone
jar
in
a
corner,
set
it
on
the
fire
beside
the
hissing
gridiron,
got
lemons,
sugar,
and
a

china
punch

was
brewing

doors,
and
tell
your
mistress
to
go
to
bed."
He
returned.

as,
with
his
fine

as
the
embers
over
which
he
bent,
he
assiduously
turned
the
mutton
chops.
"You
are
not
under
petticoat
government,
like
poor
Sweeting,

how
the
fat
spits!
it
has
burnt

Now
you
and
I,
Moore
there's
a
fine
brown
one
for
you,
and

you
and
I

our
stables
