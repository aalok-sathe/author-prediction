visible
from

Their
sole
comment
on
what
they
saw
was
a
cynical
smile
flashed
into
each
other's
stern
eyes.
A
flourishing
oratorical
cough
was
now
heard,
followed
by
the
interjection
"Whisht!"
designed,
as
it
seemed,
to
still
the
hum
of
several
voices.
Moore
opened
his
casement
an
inch
or
two
to
admit
sound
more
freely.
"Joseph
Scott,"
began
a
snuffling
voice
Scott
was
standing
sentinel
at
the
counting
house
door
"might
we
inquire
if
your
master
be
within,
and
is
to
be
spoken
to?"
"He's
within,

Joe

then,
if
you
please"

"you"),
"have
the
goodness
to
tell
him
that
twelve
gentlemen
wants
to
see
him."
"He'd

ax
what
for,"
suggested

"I

weel
tell
him

at
t'

time."
"For
a
purpose,"
was
the
answer.
Joe
entered.
"Please,
sir,
there's
twelve
gentlemen
wants
to
see
ye,
'for
a
purpose.'"
"Good,
Joe;
I'm
their
man.
Sugden,
come
when
I
whistle."
Moore
went
out,
chuckling
dryly.
He
advanced
into
the
yard,
one
hand
in
his
pocket,
the
other
in
his
waistcoat,
his
cap
brim
over
his
eyes,
shading
in
some
measure
their
deep
dancing
ray
of
scorn.
Twelve
men
