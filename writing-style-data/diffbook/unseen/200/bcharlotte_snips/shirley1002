I
know
the
difference.
Ruin
is
an
evil,
but
one
for
which
I
am
prepared;
the
day
of
whose
coming
I
know,
for
I
have
calculated.
I
can
yet
put
it
off
six
months
not
an
hour
longer.
If
things
by
that
time
alter,
which
is
not
probable;
if
fetters,
which
now
seem
indissoluble,
should
be
loosened
from
our
trade
(of
all
things
the
most
unlikely
to
happen),
I
might
conquer
in
this
long
struggle
yet
I
might
good
God!
what
might
I
not
do?
But
the
thought
is
a
brief
madness;
let
me
see
things
with
sane
eyes.
Ruin
will
come,
lay
her
axe
to
my
fortune's
roots,
and
hew
them
down.
I
shall
snatch
a
sapling,
I
shall
cross
the
sea,
and
plant
it
in
American
woods.
Louis
will
go
with
me.
Will
none
but
Louis
go?
I
cannot
tell
I
have
no
right
to
ask."
He
entered
the
house.
It
was
afternoon,
twilight
yet
out
of
doors
starless
and
moonless
twilight;
for
though
keenly
freezing
with
a
dry,
black
frost,
heaven
wore
a
mask
of
clouds
congealed
and
fast
locked.
The
mill
dam
too
was
frozen.
The
Hollow
was
very
still.
Indoors
it
was
already
dark.
