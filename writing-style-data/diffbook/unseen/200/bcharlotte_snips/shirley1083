deliberately,
but
it
will
work
well.
He
will
be
made
magistrate
of
the
district
Shirley
says
he
shall.
She
would
proceed
impetuously
and
prematurely
to
obtain
for
him
this
dignity,
if
he
would
let
her,
but
he
will
not.
As
usual,
he
will
be
in
no
haste.
Ere
he
has
been
master
of
Fieldhead
a
year
all
the
district
will
feel
his
quiet
influence,
and
acknowledge
his
unassuming
superiority.
A
magistrate
is
wanted;
they
will,
in
time,
invest
him
with
the
office
voluntarily
and
unreluctantly.
Everybody
admires
his
future
wife,
and
everybody
will,
in
time,
like
him.
He
is
of
the
pate
generally
approved,
bon
comme
le
pain
daily
bread
for
the
most
fastidious,
good
for
the
infant
and
the
aged,
nourishing
for
the
poor,
wholesome
for
the
rich.
Shirley,
in
spite
of
her
whims
and
oddities,
her
dodges
and
delays,
has
an
infatuated
fondness
for
him.
She
will
one
day
see
him
as
universally
beloved
as
even
she
could
wish.
He
will
also
be
universally
esteemed,
considered,
consulted,
depended
on
too
much
so.
His
advice
will
be
always
judicious,
his
help
always
good
natured.
Ere
long
both
will
be
in
inconvenient
request.
He
will
have
to
impose
restrictions.
