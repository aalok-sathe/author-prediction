She
must
look
after
Shirley,
then,
in
this
matter,
or
her
expected
companion
would
fail
her.
Whit
Tuesday
saw
her
rise
almost
with
the
sun.
She,
Fanny,
and
Eliza
were
busy
the
whole
morning
arranging
the
rectory
parlours
in
first
rate
company
order,
and

cooling
refreshments

Her
simple
bonnet
had
been
trimmed
to
correspond
with
her
sash;

white
crape
suited

dress.
When
ready
she
formed
a
