moonlight
beauty
attracted
her
glance,
and
stayed
her
step
an
instant.
Tree
and
hall
rose
peaceful
under
the
night
sky
and
clear
full
orb;
pearly
paleness
gilded
the
building;
mellow
brown
gloom
bosomed
it
round;
shadows
of
deep
green
brooded
above
its
oak
wreathed
roof.
The
broad
pavement
in
front
shone
pale
also;
it
gleamed
as
if
some
spell
had
transformed
the
dark
granite
to
glistering
Parian.
On
the
silvery
space
slept
two
sable
shadows,
thrown
sharply
defined
from
two
human
figures.
These
figures

seen
were

from

the
trunk
of
the
cedar.

Pryor
and
Shirley?"
Certainly
it
is
Shirley.
Who
else
has
a
shape
so
lithe,
and
proud,
and
graceful?
And
her
face,
too,
is
visible
her
countenance
careless
and
pensive,
and
musing
and
mirthful,
and
mocking
and
tender.
Not
fearing
the
dew,
she
has
not
covered
her
head;
her
curls
are
free
they
veil
her
neck
and
caress
her
shoulder
with
their
tendril
rings.
