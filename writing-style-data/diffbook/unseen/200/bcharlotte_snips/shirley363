be
new
and
unfamiliar
to
them
in
order
to
seem
agreeable
or
estimable
in
their
eyes;
and
whether
it
is
impossible
to
their
natures
to
retain
a
constant
interest
and
affection
for
those
they
see
every
day."
"I
don't
know.
I
can't
clear
up
your
doubts.
I
ponder
over
similar
ones
myself
sometimes.
But,
to
tell
you
a
secret,
if
I
were
convinced
that
they
are
necessarily
and
universally
different
from
us
fickle,
soon
petrifying,
unsympathizing
I
would
never
marry.
I
should
not
like
to
find
out
that
what
I
loved
did
not
love
me,
that
it
was
weary
of
me,
and
that
whatever
effort
I
might
make
to
please
would
hereafter
be
worse
than
useless,
since
it
was
inevitably
in
its
nature
to
change
and
become
indifferent.
That
discovery
once
made,
what
should
I
long
for?
To
go
away,
to
remove
from
a
presence
where
my
society
gave
no
pleasure."
"But
you
could
not
if
you
were
married."
"No,
I
could
not.
There
it
is.
I
could
never
be
my
own
mistress
more.
A
terrible
thought!
It
suffocates
me!
Nothing
irks
me
like
the
idea
of
being
a
burden
and
a
bore
an
inevitable
burden,
a
ceaseless
bore!
Now,
