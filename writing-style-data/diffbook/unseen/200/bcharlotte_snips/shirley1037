I
must
be
proud.'
"'I
have
received
ordinances,
and
own
obligations
stringent
as
yours.'
"We
had
reached
a
critical
point
now,
and
we
halted
and
looked
at
each
other.
She
would
not
give
in,
I
felt.
Beyond
this
I
neither
felt
nor
saw.
A
few
moments
yet
were
mine.
The
end
was
coming
I
heard
its
rush
but
not
come.
I
would
dally,
wait,
talk,
and
when
impulse
urged
I
would
act.
I
am
never
in
a

I
never
was
in
a
hurry
in
my
whole
life.

Keeldar,

are
as

likely
to
marry
as
myself.
I
know
you
have
refused
three
nay,
four
advantageous
offers,
and,
I
believe,
a
fifth.
Have
you
rejected
Sir
Philip
Nunnely?'
"I
put
this
question
suddenly
and

"'Did
you
think
I
should
take
him?'
"'I
thought
you
might.'
"'On
what
grounds,
may
I
ask?'
"'Conformity
of
rank,
age,
pleasing
contrast
of
temper
for
he
is
mild
and
amiable
harmony
of
intellectual
tastes.'
"'A
beautiful
sentence!
Let
us
take
it
to
pieces.
"Conformity
of
rank."
He
is
quite
above
me.
