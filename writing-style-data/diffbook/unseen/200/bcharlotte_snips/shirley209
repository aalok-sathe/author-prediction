in
your
own
language,
there
is
a
Providence
above
all
is
there
not?"
"Yes,
dear
Robert.
May
He
guard
you!"
"And
if
prayers
have
efficacy,
yours
will
benefit
me.
You
pray
for
me
sometimes?"
"Not
sometimes,
Robert.
You,
and
Louis,
and
Hortense
are
always
remembered."
"So
I
have
often
imagined.
It
has
occurred
to
me
when,
weary
and
vexed,
I
have
myself
gone
to
bed
like
a
heathen,
that
another
had
asked
forgiveness
for
my
day,
and
safety
for
my
night.
I
don't
suppose
such
vicarial
piety
will
avail
much,
but
the
petitions
come
out
of
a
sincere
breast,
from
innocent
lips.
They
should
be
acceptable
as
Abel's
offering;
and
doubtless
would
be,
if
the
object
deserved
them."
"Annihilate
that
doubt.
It
is
groundless."
"When
a
man
has
been
brought
up
only
to
make
money,
and
lives
to
make
it,
and
for
nothing
else,
and
scarcely
breathes
any
other
air
than
that
of
mills
and
markets,
it
seems
odd
to
utter
his
name
in
a
prayer,
or
to
mix
his
idea
with
anything
divine;
and
very
strange
it
seems
that
a
good,
pure
heart
should
take
him
in
and
harbour
him,
as
if
he
had
any
claim
to
that
sort
