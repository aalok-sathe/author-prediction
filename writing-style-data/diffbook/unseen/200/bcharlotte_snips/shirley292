to
Caroline
one
evening
as
she
was
sitting
at
work
near
the
drawing
room
window.
Her
face
was
turned
towards
him,
and
the
light
fell
full
upon
it.
It
had
struck
him
a
few
minutes
before
that
she
was
looking
paler
and
quieter
than
she
used
to
look.
It
had
not

him
either
that
Robert
Moore's
name

"Do
you
hear
me?"
he
asked.
"Yes,
uncle."
"Of
course
you
mean
to
attend
to
what
I
say?"
"Yes,
certainly."
"And
