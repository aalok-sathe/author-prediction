again.'
I'd
write
to
Robert,
if
I
were
you,
and
remind
him
of
that."
"Robert
had
views
on
Miss
Keeldar?"
inquired
Louis,
as
if
the
idea
was
new
to
him.
"Views
I
suggested
to
him
myself,
and
views
he
might
have
realized,
for
she
liked
him."
"As
a
neighbour?"
"As

I

I've
naught
to
say.
I'm
a
plain,
practical
man
myself,
and
if
Robert
is
willing
to
give
up
that
royal
prize
to
a
lad
rival
a
puling
slip
of
aristocracy
I
am
quite
agreeable.
At
his
age,
in
his
place,
with
his
inducements,
I
would
have
acted
differently.
Neither
baronet,
nor
duke,
nor
prince
should
have
snatched
my
sweetheart
from
me
without
a
struggle.
But
you
tutors
are
such
solemn
chaps;
