work
wi'
these
frames;
we
can
get
nought
to
do;
we
can
earn
nought.
What
is
to
be
done?
Mun
we
say,
wisht!
and
lig
us
down
and
dee?
Nay;
I've
no
grand
words
at
my
tongue's
end,
Mr.
Moore,
but
I
feel
that
it
wad
be
a
low
principle
for
a

Ye'll
say
that's

So

then,
for
so
much
slacker
will
t'
Parliament
men
be

"Worry
the
Parliament
