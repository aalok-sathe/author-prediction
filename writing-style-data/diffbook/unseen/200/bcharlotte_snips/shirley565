Fieldhead
to
morrow,
and
you
shall
choose
what
you
like
best
out
of
Mrs.
Gill's
store
room."
The
hour
was
now
that
of
dusk.
A
clear
air
favoured
the
kindling
of
the
stars.
"There
will
be
just
light
enough
to
show
me
the
way
home,"
said
Miss
Keeldar,
as
she
prepared
to
take
leave
of
Caroline
at
the
rectory
garden
door.
"You
must
not
go
alone,
Shirley;
Fanny
shall
accompany
you."
"That
she
shall

Of
what
need
I
be
afraid
in
my
own
parish?
I
would
walk
from
Fieldhead
to
the
church
any
fine
midsummer

of
seeing
the
stars
and
the
chance
of
meeting
a
fairy."
"But
just
wait
till
the
crowd
is
cleared
away."
"Agreed.
There
are
the
five
Misses
Armitage
streaming
by.
Here
comes
Mrs.
Sykes's
phaeton,
Mr.
Wynne's
close
carriage,
Mrs.
Birtwhistle's
car.
I
don't
wish
to
go
through
the
ceremony
of
bidding
them
all
good
bye,
so
we
will
step
into
the
garden
and
take
shelter
amongst
the
laburnums
for
an
instant."
The
rectors,
their
curates,
and
their
churchwardens
now
issued
from
the
church
porch.
There
was
a
great
confabulation,
shaking
of
hands,
congratulation
