are
sometimes
short
of
work
and
of
bread,
that
therefore
your
class
are
martyrs,
and
that
the
whole
form
of
government
under
which
you
live
is
wrong.
And,
moreover,
you
need
not
for
a
moment
to
insinuate
that
the
virtues
have
taken
refuge
in
cottages
and
wholly
abandoned
slated
houses.
Let
me
tell
you,
I
particularly
abominate
that
sort
of
trash,
because
I
know
so
well
that
human
nature
is
human
nature
everywhere,
whether
under
tile
or
thatch,
and
that
in
every
specimen
of
human
nature
that
breathes,
vice
and
virtue
are
ever
found
blended,
in
smaller
or
greater
proportions,
and
that
the
proportion
is
not
determined
by
station.
I
have
seen
villains
who
were
rich,
and
I
have
seen
villains
who
were
poor,
and
I
have
seen
villains
who
were
neither
rich
nor
poor,
but
who
had
realized
Agar's
wish,
and
lived
in
fair
and
modest
competency.
The
clock
is
going
to
strike
six.
Away
with
you,
Joe,
and
ring
the
mill
bell."
It
was
now
the
middle
of
the
month
of
February;
by
six
o'clock
therefore
dawn
was
just
beginning
to
steal
on
night,
to
penetrate
with
a
pale
ray
its
brown
obscurity,
and
give
a
demi
translucence
