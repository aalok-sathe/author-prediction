difficult,
in
the
darkness,
to
distinguish;
but
something
terrible,
a
still
renewing
tumult,
was
obvious
fierce
attacks,
desperate
repulses.
The
mill
yard,
the
mill
itself,
was
full
of
battle
movement.
There
was
scarcely
any
cessation
now
of
the
discharge
of
firearms;
and
there
was
struggling,
rushing,
trampling,
and
shouting
between.
The
aim
of
the
assailants
seemed
to
be
to
enter
the
mill,
that
of
the
defenders
to
beat
them
off.
They
heard
the
rebel
leader
cry,
"To
the

lads!"
They
heard
a
voice
retort,
"Come
round;
we
will
meet

"To
the

was
the

"Welcome!
we
shall

was
the
response.
And

the
loudest
rattle
that
had
yet
been

burst
from
the
counting
house

when
the
mass
of
rioters
rushed
up
to
it.
The
voice
that
had
spoken
was
Moore's
own
voice.
They
could
tell
by
its
tones
that
his
soul
was
now
warm
with
the
conflict;
they
could
guess
that
the
fighting
animal
was
roused
in
every
one
of
those
men
there
struggling
together,
and
was
for
the
time
quite
paramount
above
the
rational
human
being.
Both
