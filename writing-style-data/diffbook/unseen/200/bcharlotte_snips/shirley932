better."
"Madam,
it
is
a
question
of
common
sense
and
common
prudence,
not
of
sympathy
and
sentiment,
and
so
on.
Did
you
say
it
was
Mr.
Helstone?"
"Not
precisely,
but
as
near
as
may
be;
they
are
rather
alike."
"I
will
know
the
name;
I
will
have
particulars."
"They
positively
are
rather
alike.
Their
very
faces
are
not
dissimilar
a
pair
of
human
falcons
and
dry,
direct,
decided
both.
But
my
hero
is
the
mightier
of
the
two.
His
mind
has
the
clearness
of
the
deep
sea,
the
patience
of
its
rocks,
the
force
of
its
billows."
"Rant
and
fustian!"
"I
dare
say
he
can
be
harsh
as
a
saw
edge
and
gruff
as
a
hungry
raven."
"Miss
Keeldar,
does
the
person
reside
in
Briarfield?
Answer
me
that."
"Uncle,
I
am
going
to
tell
you;
his
name
is
trembling
on
my
tongue."
"Speak,
girl!"
"That
was
well
said,
uncle.
'Speak,
girl!'
It
is
quite
tragic.
England
has
howled
savagely
against
this
man,
uncle,
and
she
will
one
day
roar
exultingly
over
him.
He
has
been
unscared
by
the
howl,
and
he
will
be
unelated
by
the
shout."
"I
said
she
was
mad.
She
is."
"This
country
will
change
and
change
