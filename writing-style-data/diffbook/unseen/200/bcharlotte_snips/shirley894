of
you?"
"Self
conceit?
What
is
it?
Self
respect,
self
tolerance
even,
what
are
they?
Do
you
sell
the
articles?
Do
you
know
anybody
who
does?
Give
an
indication.
They
would
find
in
me
a
liberal
chapman.
I
would
part
with
my
last
guinea
this
minute
to
buy."
"Is
it
so
with
you,
Robert?
I
find
that
spicy.
I
like
a
man
to
speak
his
mind.
What
has
gone
wrong?"
"The
machinery
of
all
my
nature;
the
whole
enginery
of
this
human
mill;
the
boiler,
which
I
take
to
be
the
heart,
is
fit
to
burst."
"That
suld
be
putten
i'
print;
it's
striking.
It's
almost
blank
verse.
Ye'll
be
jingling
into
poetry
just
e'now.
If
the
afflatus
comes,
give
way,
Robert.
Never
heed
me;
I'll
bear
it
this
whet
[time]."
"Hideous,
abhorrent,
base
blunder!
You
may
commit
in
a
moment
what
you
will
rue
for
years
what
life
cannot
cancel."
"Lad,
go
on.
I
call
it
pie,
nuts,
sugar
candy.
I
like
the
taste
uncommonly.
Go
on.
It
will
do
you
good
to
talk.
The
moor
is
before
us
now,
and
there
is
no
life
for
many
a
mile
round."
"I
will
talk.
I
am
not
ashamed
to
tell.
