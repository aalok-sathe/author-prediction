he
had
a
cause
of
regret
at
this
blissful
moment,
it
was
that
Miss
Dora
happened
to
be
absent
Dora
being
the
one
whom
he
secretly
hoped
one
day
to
call
Mrs.
David
Sweeting,
with
whom
he
dreamt
of
taking
stately
walks,
leading
her
like
an
empress
through
the
village
of
Nunnely;
and
an
empress
she
would
have
been,
if
size
could
make
an
empress.
She
was
vast,
ponderous.
Seen
from
behind,
she

of

but
withal
she

a

face,
and
no
unkindly
character.

with
his
cup
half

of
cold
tea

the
rest
had
finished
and
after
he
himself
had
discussed
such
allowance
of
viands
as
he
felt
competent
to
swallow
long,
indeed,
after
signs
of
impatience
had
been
manifested
all
round
the
board,
till
chairs
were
pushed
back,
till
the
talk
flagged,
till
silence
fell.
Vainly
did
Caroline
inquire
repeatedly
if
he
would
have
another
cup,
if
he
would
take
a
little
hot
tea,
as
that
must
be
cold,
etc.;
