meantime
uncomfortably
open
for
the
convenience
of
running
in
and
out
to
announce
his
failures
and
successes
with
noisy
brusquerie
he
had
observed
that
under
such
entertaining
circumstances
Caroline
had
a
trick
of
disappearing,
tripping
noiselessly
upstairs,
and
remaining
invisible
till
called
down
to
supper.
On
the
other
hand,
when
Robert
Moore
was
the
guest,
though
he
elicited
no
vivacities
from
the
cat,
did
nothing

the
knitting
of
missionary
basket
socks.
She
was

Robert
paid
her
little
attention,
scarcely
ever
addressing
his
discourse
to
her;
but
Mr.
Helstone,
not
being
one
of
those
elderly
gentlemen
who
are
easily

finding
himself
on
all
occasions
extremely
wide

watched
