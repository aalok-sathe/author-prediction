the
Fieldhead
plantations
to
pass;
but
you
will
be
back
by
six
or
before?"
"Certainly
he
will,"
affirmed
Hortense.
"And
now,
my
child,
prepare
your
lessons
for
repetition,
while
I
put
the
peas
to
soak
for
the
puree
at
dinner."
With
this
direction
she
left
the
room.
"You
suspect
I
have
many
enemies,

Caroline,"
said

after

model
of
a
Flemish
school
girl.
What
life

Caroline?
What

your
French,
drawing,
and

accomplishments,
when
they
are
acquired?"

say,
when
they
are
acquired;
for,
as
you
are
aware,
till
Hortense
began
to
teach
me,
I
knew
precious
little.
As

the
life
I
am
destined
