of
the
gilded
cup
of
vice
or
from
the
beggar's
wallet
of
avarice.
We
are
sickened,
degraded;
everything
good
in
us
rebels
against
us;
our
souls
rise
bitterly
indignant
against
our
bodies;
there
is
a
period
of
civil
war;
if
the
soul
has
strength,
it
conquers
and
rules
thereafter."
"What
art
thou
going
to
do
now,
Robert?
What
are
thy
plans?"
"For
my
private
plans,
I'll
keep
them
to
myself
which
is
very
easy,
as
at
present
I
have
none.
No
private
life
is
permitted
a
man
in
my
position
a
man
in
debt.
For
my
public
plans,
my
views
are
a
little
altered.
While
I
was
in
Birmingham
I
looked
a
little
into
reality,
considered
closely
and
at
their
source
the
causes
of
the
present
troubles
of
this
country.
I
did
the
same
in
London.
Unknown,
I
could
go
where
I
pleased,
mix
with
whom
I
would.
I
went
where
there
was
want
of
food,
of
fuel,
of
clothing;
where
there
was
no
occupation
and
no
hope.
I
saw
some,
with
naturally
elevated
tendencies
and
good
feelings,
kept
down
amongst
sordid
privations
and
harassing
griefs.
I
saw
many
originally
low,
and
to
whom
lack
of
education
left
scarcely
anything
