it
may
also
brave
the
first
of

Every
one
noticed
the
change
in
Miss
Helstone's
appearance,
and
most
people
said
she
was
going
to
die.
She
never
thought
so
herself.
She
felt
in
no
dying
case;
she
had
neither
pain
nor
sickness.
Her
appetite
was
diminished;

was
observed

with
more
curiosity
than
sympathy.
Old
ladies
were
always
offering
her
their
advice,
recommending
this
or

nostrum;
young
ladies
looked
at
her
in
a
way
she
understood,
and
from
which
she
shrank.
Their
eyes
said
they
knew
she
had
been
"disappointed,"
