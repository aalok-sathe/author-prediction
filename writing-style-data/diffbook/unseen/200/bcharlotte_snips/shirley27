were
exchanged
for
soft
mud.
He
looked
but
for
certain
landmarks
the
spire
of
Briarfield
Church;
farther
on,
the
lights
of
Redhouse.
This
was
an
inn;
and
when
he
reached
it,
the
glow
of
a
fire
through
a
half
curtained
window,
a
vision
of
glasses
on
a
round
table,
and
of
revellers
on
an
oaken
settle,
had
nearly
drawn
aside
the

course.
He
thought
longingly

cut
across
fields.
These
fields
were
level
and
monotonous.
Malone
took
a
direct
course
through
them,
jumping
hedge
and
wall.
He
passed
but
one
building
here,
and
that
seemed
large
and
hall
like,
though
irregular.
You
could
see
a
high
gable,
then
a
long
front,
then
a
low
gable,
then
a
thick,
lofty
stack
of
chimneys.
There
were
