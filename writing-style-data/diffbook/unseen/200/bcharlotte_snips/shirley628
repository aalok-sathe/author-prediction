Make
you
Prime
Minister
of
England
to
morrow,
and
you
would
have
to
abandon
them.
You
abuse
Moore
for
defending
his
mill.
Had
you
been
in
Moore's
place
you
could
not
with
honour
or
sense
have
acted
otherwise
than
he

You

Mr.
Helstone
for
everything

faults;
he

when
I
hear
the
outbreaks
of
their
small
spite
against
Dissenters;
when
I
witness
their
silly,
narrow
jealousies
and
assumptions;
when
their
palaver
about
forms,
and
traditions,
and
superstitions
is
sounding
in
my
ear;
when
I
behold
their
insolent
carriage

the
poor,

servility

rich
