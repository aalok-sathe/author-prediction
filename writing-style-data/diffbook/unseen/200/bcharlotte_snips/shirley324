stacks,
were
rich
in
crayon
touches
and
sepia
lights
and
shades.
The
trees
behind
were
fine,
bold,
and
spreading;
the
cedar
on
the
lawn
in
front
was
grand;
and
the
granite
urns
on
the
garden
wall,
the
fretted
arch
of
the
gateway,
were,
for
an
artist,
as
the
very
desire
of
the
eye.
One
mild
May
evening
Caroline,
passing
near
about
moonrise,
and
feeling,
though
weary,
unwilling
yet
to
go
home,
where
there
was
only
the
bed
of
thorns
and
the
night
of
grief
to
anticipate,
sat
down
on
the
mossy
ground
near
the
gate,
and
gazed
through
towards
cedar
and
mansion.
It
was
a
still
night
calm,
dewy,
cloudless;
the
gables,
turned
to
the
west,
reflected
the
clear
amber
of
the
horizon
they
faced;
the
oaks
behind
were
black;
the
cedar
was
blacker.
Under
its
dense,
raven
boughs
a
glimpse
of
sky
opened
gravely
blue.
It
was
full
of
the
moon,
which
looked
solemnly
and
mildly
down
on
Caroline
from
beneath
that
sombre
canopy.
She
felt
this
night
and
prospect
mournfully
lovely.
She
wished
she
could
be
happy;
she
wished
she
could
know
inward
peace;
she
wondered
Providence
had
no
pity
on
her,
and
would
not
help
or
console
