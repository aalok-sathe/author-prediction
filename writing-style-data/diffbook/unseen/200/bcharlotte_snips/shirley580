made
them
pause.
Scarce
had
they
set
foot
on
the
solid
opposite
bank
when
a
shot
split
the
air
from
the
north.
One
second
elapsed.
Further
off
burst
a
like
note
in
the
south.
Within
the
space
of
three
minutes
similar
signals
boomed
in
the
east
and
west.
"I
thought

were
dead
at
the
first
explosion,"
observed
Shirley,
drawing
a
long
breath.

the
yard;
they
could
see
the
road
beyond.
And
the
first
glance
in
that
direction
told
Shirley
she
was
right

her
conjecture.
They
were
already
too
