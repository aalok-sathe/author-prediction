you!
What
puts
Mrs.
Pryor
into
your
head?"
"You
call
her
'mamma,'
don't
you?"
"She
is
my
mamma."
"Not
possible
or
so
inefficient,
so
careless
a
mamma;
I
should
make
a
five
times
better
one.
You
may
laugh.
I
have
no
objection
to
see
you
laugh.
Your
teeth
I
hate
ugly
teeth;
but
yours
are
as
pretty
as
a
pearl
necklace,
and
a
necklace
of
which
the
pearls
are
very
fair,
even,
and
well
matched
too."
"Martin,
what
now?
I
thought
the
Yorkes
never
paid
compliments?"
"They
have
not
done
till
this
generation;
but
I
feel
as
if
it
were
my
vocation
to
turn
out
a
new
variety
of
the
Yorke
species.
I
am
rather
tired
of
my
own
ancestors.
We
have
traditions
going
back
for
four
ages
tales
of
Hiram,
which
was
the
son
of
Hiram,
which
was
the
son
of
Samuel,
which
was
the
son
of
John,
which
was
the
son
of
Zerubbabel
Yorke.
All,
from
Zerubbabel
down
to
the
last
Hiram,
were
such
as
you
see
my
father.
Before
that
there
was
a
Godfrey.
We
have
his
picture;
it
hangs
in
Moore's
bedroom;
it
is
like
me.
Of
his
character
we
know
nothing;
but
I
am
sure
