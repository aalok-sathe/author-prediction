Not
only
was
Miss
Ainley
poorer,
but
she
was
even
plainer
than
the
other
old
maid.
In
her
first
youth
she
must
have
been
ugly;
now,
at
the
age
of
fifty,
she
was
very
ugly.
At
first
sight,
all

gentlemen
and
inconsiderate
old

who
declared
her
hideous.
Caroline
was
soon
at
home
in
that
tiny
parlour.
A
kind
hand
took

shawl
and
