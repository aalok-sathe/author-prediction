appreciation
of
their
elegance
and
youth.
Before
gentlemen
such
as
Moore
or
Helstone,
for
instance
William
was
often
a
little
dogged;
with
proud
or
insolent
ladies,
too,
he
was
quite
unmanageable,
sometimes
very
resentful;
but
he
was
most
sensible
of,
most
tractable
to,
good
humour
and
civility.
His
nature
a
stubborn
one
was
repelled
by
inflexibility
in
other
natures;
for
which
reason
he
had
never
been
able
to
like
his
former
master,
Moore;
and
unconscious
of
that
gentleman's
good
opinion
of
himself,
and
of
the
service
he
had
secretly
rendered
him
in
recommending
him
as
gardener
to
Mr.
Yorke,
and
by
this
means
to
other
families
in
the
neighbourhood,
he
continued
to
harbour
a
grudge
against
his
austerity.
Latterly
he
had
often
worked
at
Fieldhead.
Miss
Keeldar's
frank,
hospitable
manners
were
perfectly
charming
to
him.
Caroline
he
had
known
from
her
childhood;
unconsciously
she
was
his
ideal
of
a
lady.
Her
gentle
mien,
step,
gestures,
her
grace
of
person
and
attire,
moved
some
artist
fibres
about
his
peasant
heart.
He
had
a
pleasure
in
looking
at
her,
as
he
had
in
examining
rare
flowers
or
in
seeing
pleasant
landscapes.
Both
the
ladies
liked
William;
it
was
their
delight
to
lend
