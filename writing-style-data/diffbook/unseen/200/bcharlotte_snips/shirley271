but
they
must
come
and
see.
Jessy
was
about
to
reply,
when
one
of
the
boys
unexpectedly
broke
in,
"I
know
that
Miss
Helstone
you
have
all
been
palavering
about.
She's
an
ugly
girl.
I
hate
her.
I
hate
all
womenites.
I
wonder
what
they
were
made
for."
"Martin!"
said
his
father,
for
Martin
it
was.
The
lad
only
answered
by
turning
his
cynical
young
face,
half
arch,
half
truculent,
towards
the
paternal
chair.
"Martin,
my
lad,
thou'rt
a
swaggering

book,
and
deliberately
wrote

"Ten

Martin,
if
thou
and
I
be
both
alive
at
that
day,
I'll
remind
thee
of
that
speech."
"I'll
say
the
same
then.
I
mean
always
to
hate
women.
They're
such
dolls;
they
do
nothing
but
dress
themselves
finely,
and
go
swimming
about
to
be
admired.
I'll
never
marry.
I'll
be
a
bachelor."
"Stick
to
it!
stick
to
it!
Hesther"
(addressing
his
wife),
"I
was
like
him
when
I
was
his
age
a
regular
misogamist;
