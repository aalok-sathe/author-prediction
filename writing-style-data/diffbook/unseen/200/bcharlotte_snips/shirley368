first
of
created
things."
"Above
us?"
"I
would
scorn
to
contend
for
empire
with
him
I
would
scorn
it.
Shall
my
left
hand
dispute
for
precedence
with
my
right?
Shall
my
heart
quarrel
with
my
pulse?
Shall
my
veins
be
jealous
of
the
blood
which
fills
them?"
"Men
and
women,
husbands
and
wives,
quarrel
horribly,
Shirley."
"Poor
things!
Poor,
fallen,
degenerate
things!
God
made

for
another

for
other
feelings."
"But

we
men's
equals,
or
are

ever

I

meet

"I
should
be
glad
to
see
him
any
day.
The

It
degrades

stoop;
it
is
glorious
to
look

What
frets
me
is,
that
when
I
try
to
esteem,
I
am
baffled;
when
religiously
inclined,
there
are
but
false
gods
to
adore.
I
disdain
to
be
a
pagan."
"Miss
Keeldar,
will
you
come
in?
We
are
here
at
the
rectory
gates."
"Not
to
day,
but
to
morrow
I
shall
fetch
you
to
spend
the
evening
with
me.
Caroline
Helstone,
if
you
really
are
