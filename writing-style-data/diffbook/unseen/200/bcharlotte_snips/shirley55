"Hum!
They've
only
served
you
as
they
serve
others.
But,
however,
the
poor
fellows
in
the
ditch
will
be
expecting
help
with
some
impatience.
This
is
a
wet
night
for
such
a
berth.
I
and
Tom
will
go
with
you.
Malone
may
stay
behind
and
take
care
of
the
mill.
What
is
the
matter
with
him?
His
eyes
seem
starting
out
of
his
head."
"He
has
been
eating
a
mutton
chop."
"Indeed!
Peter
Augustus,
be
on
your
guard.
Eat
no
more
mutton
chops
to
night.
You
are
left
here
in
command
of
these
premises
an
honourable
post!"
"Is
anybody
to
stay
with
me?"
"As
many
of
the
present
assemblage
as
choose.
My
lads,
how
many
of
you
will
remain
here,
and
how
many
will
go
a
little
way
with
me
and
Mr.
Moore
on
the
Stilbro'
road,
to
meet
some
men
who
have
been
waylaid
and
assaulted
by
frame
breakers?"
The
small
number
of
three
volunteered
to
go;
the
rest
preferred
staying
behind.
As
Mr.
Moore
mounted
his
horse,
the
rector
asked
him
in
a
low
voice
whether
he
had
locked
up
the
mutton
chops,
so
that
Peter
Augustus
could
not
get
at
them?
The
manufacturer
nodded
an
affirmative,
and
