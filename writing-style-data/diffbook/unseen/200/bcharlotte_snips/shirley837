to
appear
quite
gay,
and
she
seemed
indignant
at
herself
that
she
could
not
perfectly
succeed.
Brief
self
spurning
epithets
burst
from
her
lips
when
alone.
"Fool!
coward!"
she
would
term
herself.
"Poltroon!"
she
would
say,
"if
you
must
tremble,
tremble
in
secret!
Quail
where
no
eye
sees
you!"
"How
dare
you,"
she
would
ask
herself
"how
dare
you
show
your
weakness
and
betray

anxieties?

And

chamber
(she
refused
to
mope,
shut
up
between
four
walls),
but

lies

of
doors,
and
which
she
could
chase,
mounted
on
Zoe,
her
mare.
She
took
long
rides
of
half
a
day.
Her
uncle
disapproved,
but
he
dared
not
remonstrate.
It
was
never
pleasant
to
face
Shirley's
anger,
even
when
she
was
healthy
and
gay;
but
now
that
her
face
showed
thin,
and
her
large
eye
looked
hollow,
there
was
something
in
the
darkening
of
that
face
and
kindling
of
that
eye
