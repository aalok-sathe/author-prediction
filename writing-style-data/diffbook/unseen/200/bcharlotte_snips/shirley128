"analyses"
were
by
no
means
a
source
of
particular
pleasure
to
Caroline;
she
thought
she
could
have
learned
French
just
as
well
without
them,
and
grudged
excessively
the
time
spent
in
pondering
over
"propositions,
principales,
et
incidents;"
in
deciding
the
"incidente
determinative,"
and
the
"incidente
applicative;"
in
examining
whether
the
proposition
was
"pleine,"
"elliptique,"
or
"implicite."
Sometimes
she
lost
herself
in
the
maze,
and
when
so
lost
she
would,
now
and
then
(while
Hortense
was
rummaging
her
drawers
upstairs
an
unaccountable
occupation
in
which
she
spent
a
large
portion
of
each
day,
arranging,
disarranging,
rearranging,
and
counter
arranging),
carry
her
book
to
Robert
in
the
counting
house,
and
get
the
rough
place
made
smooth
by
his
aid.
Mr.
Moore
possessed
a
clear,
tranquil
brain
of
his
own.
Almost
as
soon
as
he
looked
at
Caroline's
little
difficulties
they
seemed
to
dissolve
beneath
his
eye.
In
two
minutes
he
would
explain
all,
in
two
words
give
the
key
to
the
puzzle.
She
thought
if
Hortense
could
only
teach
like
him,
how
much
faster
she
might
learn!
Repaying
him
by
an
admiring
and
grateful
smile,
rather
shed
at
his
feet
than
lifted
to
his
face,
she
would
leave
the
mill
reluctantly
to
