The
result
was
an
unquenchable
scorn
of
the
quarter
whence
such
danger
was
to
be
apprehended.
The
consciousness
that
he
hunted
assassins
was
the
spur
in
his
high
mettled
temper's
flank.
As
for
fear,
he
was
too
proud,
too
hard
natured
(if
you
will),
too
phlegmatic
a
man
to
fear.
Many
a
time
he
rode
belated
over
the
moors,
moonlit
or
moonless

the
case
might
be,
with

environed
him

Four
was

did
not
neglect
his
battered
mill.
Its
reparation
was
esteemed
a
light
task,
carpenters'
and
glaziers'
work
alone
being
needed.
The
rioters
not
having
succeeded
in
effecting
an
entrance,
his
grim
metal
darlings
the
machines
had
escaped
damage.
Whether
during
this
busy
life
whether
while
stern
justice
and
exacting
business
