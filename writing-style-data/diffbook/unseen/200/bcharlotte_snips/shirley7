lads;
they
know
what
belongs
to
good
manners,
and
is
kind
to
high
and
low."
"More
bread!"
cries
Mr.
Malone,
in
a
tone
which,
though
prolonged
but
to
utter
two
syllables,
proclaims
him
at
once
a
native
of
the
land
of
shamrocks
and
potatoes.
Mrs.
Gale
hates
Mr.
Malone
more
than
either
of
the
other
two;
but
she
fears
him
also,
for
he
is
a
tall,
strongly
built
personage,
with
real
Irish
legs
and
arms,
and
a
face
as
genuinely
national
not
the
Milesian
face,
not
Daniel
O'Connell's
style,
but
the
high
featured,
North
American
Indian
sort
of
visage,
which
belongs
to
a
certain
class
of
the
Irish
gentry,
and
has
a
petrified
and
proud
look,
better
suited
to
the
owner
of
an
estate
of
slaves
than
to
the
landlord
of
a
free
peasantry.
Mr.
Malone's
father
termed
himself
a
gentleman:
he
was
poor
and
in
debt,
and
besottedly
arrogant;
and
his
son
was
like
him.
Mrs.
Gale
offered
the
loaf.
"Cut
it,
woman,"
said
her
guest;
and
the
"woman"
cut
it
accordingly.
Had
she
followed
her
inclinations,
she
would
have
cut
the
parson
also;
her
Yorkshire
soul
revolted
absolutely
from
his
manner
of
command.
The
curates
had
good
appetites,
