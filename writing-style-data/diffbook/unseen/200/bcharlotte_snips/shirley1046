Mr.
Moore?
Indeed
and
truly
I
have
lost
them
again;
and
Mrs.
Gill
wants
some
money,
and
I
have
none,
except
this
sixpence.'
"She
took
the
coin
out
of
her
apron
pocket,
and
showed
it
in
her
palm.
I
could
have
trifled
with
her,
but
it
would
not
do;
life
and
death
were
at
stake.
Mastering
at
once
the
sixpence
and
the
hand
that
held
it,
I
demanded,
'Am
I
to
die
without
you,
or
am
I
to
live
for
you?'
"'Do
as
you
please.
Far
be
it
from
me
to
dictate
your
choice.'
"'You
shall
tell
me
with
your
own
lips
whether
you
doom
me
to
exile
or
call
me
to
hope.'
"'Go;
I
can
bear
to
be
left.'
"'Perhaps
I
too
can
bear
to
leave
you.
But
reply,
Shirley,
my
pupil,
my
sovereign
reply.'
"'Die
without
me
if
you
will;
live
for
me
if
you
dare.'
"'I
am
not
afraid
of
you,
my
leopardess.
I
dare
live
for
and
with
you,
from
this
hour
till
my
death.
Now,
then,
I
have
you.
You
are
mine.
I
will
never
let
you
go.
Wherever
my
home
be,
I
have
chosen
my
wife.
If
I
stay
in
England,
in
England
you
