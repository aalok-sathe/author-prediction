house
seemed
likely
to
be
all
in
confusion,
and
orders
would
have
to
be
given
which
the
mistress
of
the
hall
alone
could
regulate.
In
a
postscript
it
was
entreated
that
Miss
Helstone
might
not
be
left
alone
at
the
rectory.
She
had
better,
it
was
suggested,
accompany
Miss
Keeldar.
"There
are
not
two
opinions
on
that
head,"
said
Shirley,
as
she
tied
on
her
own
bonnet,
and
then
ran
to
fetch
Caroline's.
"But

"Your

and
Fanny
and
Eliza
can

and
the
clerk's
wives
to
bear
them
company.
Besides,
of
course,
there
is
no
real
danger
to
be
apprehended
now.
Weeks
will
elapse
before
the
rioters
can
again
rally,
or
plan
any
other
attempt;
and
I
am
much
mistaken
if
Moore
and
Mr.
Helstone
will
not
take
advantage
of
last

outbreak
to
quell
them
altogether.
They
will
frighten
the
authorities
of
Stilbro'
