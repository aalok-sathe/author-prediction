a
stranger
to
Mr.
Moore,"
murmured
Sweeting.
"If
you
never
touched
a
pistol,
try
the
feel
of
it
now,
great
satrap
of
Egypt.
As
to
the
little
minstrel,
he
probably
prefers
encountering
the
Philistines
with
no
other
weapon
than
his
flute.
Get
their
hats,
Peter.
They'll
both
of
'em
go."
"No,
sir;
no,
Mr.
Helstone.
My
mother
wouldn't
like
it,"
pleaded
Sweeting.
"And
I
make
it
a
rule
never
to
get
mixed
up
in
affairs
of
the
kind,"
observed
Donne.
Helstone
smiled
sardonically;
Malone
laughed
a
horse
laugh.
He
then
replaced
his
arms,
took
his
hat
and
cudgel,
and
saying
that
"he
never
felt
more
in
tune
for
a
shindy
in
his
life,
and
that
he
wished
a
score
of
greasy
cloth
dressers
might
beat
up
Moore's
quarters
that
night,"
he
made
his
exit,
clearing
the
stairs
at
a
stride
or
two,
and
making
the
house
shake
with
the
bang
of
the
front
door
behind
him.
The
evening
was
pitch
dark:
star
and
moon
were
quenched
in
gray
rain
clouds
gray
they
would
have
been
by
day;
by
night
they
looked
sable.
Malone
was
not
a
man
given
to
close
observation
of
nature;
her
changes
passed,
for
the
most
part,
