Hortense
seized
her
hand
at
the
parlour
door,
and
leading
her
to
Robert,
who
stood
in
bodily
presence,
tall
and
dark
against
the
one
window,
presented
her
with
a
mixture
of
agitation
and
formality,
as
though
they
had
been
utter
strangers,
and
this
was
their
first
mutual
introduction.
Increasing
puzzle!
He
bowed
rather
awkwardly,
and
turning
from
her
with
a
stranger's
embarrassment,
he
met
the
doubtful

"Well,"
