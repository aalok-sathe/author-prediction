Your
lips
are
parched."
She
held
a
glass
filled
with
some
cooling
beverage
to
her
mouth.
"Have
you
eaten
anything
to
day,
Caroline?"
"I
cannot
eat."
"But
soon
your
appetite
will
return;
it
must
return
that
is,
I
pray
God
it
may."
In
laying
her
again
on
the
couch,
she
encircled
her
in
her
arms;
and
while
so
doing,
by
a
movement
which
seemed
scarcely
voluntary,
she
drew
her
to
her
heart,
and
held
her
close
gathered
an
instant.
"I
shall
hardly
wish
to
get
well,
that
I
may
keep
you
always,"
said
Caroline.
Mrs.
Pryor
did
not
smile
at
this
speech.
Over
her
features
ran
a
tremor,
which
for
some
minutes
she
was
absorbed
in
repressing.
"You
are
more
used
to
Fanny
than
to
me,"
she
remarked
ere
long.
"I
should
think
my
attendance
must
seem
strange,
officious?"
"No;
quite
natural,
and
very
soothing.
You
must
have
been
accustomed
to
wait
on
sick
people,
ma'am.
You
move
about
the
room
so
softly,
and
you
speak
so
quietly,
and
touch
me
so
gently."
"I
am
dexterous
in
nothing,
my
dear.
You
will
often
find
me
awkward,
but
never
negligent."
Negligent,
indeed,
she
was
not.
From
that
hour
Fanny
and
Eliza
