dislike
me.
You
have
no
just
reason
for
disliking
me;
therefore
keep
the
expression
of
your
aversion
to
yourself.
If
at
any
time
in
future
you
evince
it
annoyingly,
I
shall
answer
even
less
scrupulously
than
I
have
done
now."
She
ceased,
and
sat
in
white
and
still
excitement.
She
had
spoken
in
the
clearest
of
tones,
neither
fast
nor
loud;
but
her
silver
accents
thrilled
the
ear.
The
speed
of
the
current
in
her
veins
was
just
then
as

was

she
said,
nodding
her
cap
approvingly,
"She
has
spirit
in
her,
after
all.
Always
speak
as
honestly
as
you
have
done
just
now,"
she
continued,
"and
you'll
do."
"I
repel
a
recommendation
so
offensive,"
was
the
answer,
delivered
in
the
same
pure
key,
with
the
same
clear
look.
"I
reject
counsel
poisoned
by
insinuation.
It
is
my
right
to
speak
as
I
think
proper;
nothing
binds
me
to
converse
as
you
dictate.
So
far
from
always
speaking
as
I
have
done
just
now,
I
shall
never
address
any
one
