the
edge
of
the
bed
and
lean
over
the
pillow;
to
hold
his
brother's
hand,
and
press
his
pale
forehead
with
his
fraternal
lips;
and
Mrs.
Yorke
bore
it
well.
She
suffered
him
to
stay
half
the
day
there;
she
once
suffered
him
to
sit
up
all
night
in
the
chamber;
she
rose
herself
at
five
o'clock
of
a
wet
November
morning,
and
with
her
own
hands
lit
the
kitchen
fire,
and
made
the
brothers
a
breakfast,
and
served
it
to
them
herself.
Majestically
arrayed
in
a
boundless
flannel
wrapper,
a
shawl,
and
her
nightcap,
she
sat
and
watched
them
eat,
as
complacently
as
a
hen
beholds
her
chickens
feed.
Yet
she
gave
the
cook
warning
that
day
for
venturing
to
make
and
carry
up
to
Mr.
Moore
a
basin
of
sago
gruel;
and
the
housemaid
lost
her
favour
because,
when
Mr.
Louis
was
departing,
she
brought
him
his
surtout
aired
from
the
kitchen,
and,
like
a
"forward
piece"
as
she
was,
helped
him
on
with
it,
and
accepted
in
return
a
smile,
a
"Thank
you,
my
girl,"
and
a
shilling.
Two
ladies
called
one
day,
pale
and
anxious,
and
begged
earnestly,
humbly,
to
be
allowed
to
see
Mr.
Moore
