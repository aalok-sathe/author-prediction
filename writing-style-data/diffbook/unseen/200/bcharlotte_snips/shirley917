the
ballad
faithful
love
that
refused
to
abandon
its
object;
love
that
disaster
could
not
shake;
love
that
in
calamity
waxed
fonder,
in
poverty
clung
closer.
The
words
were
set
to
a
fine
old
air;
in
themselves
they
were
simple
and
sweet.
Perhaps,
when
read,
they
wanted
force;
when
well
sung,
they
wanted
nothing.
Shirley
sang
them
well.
She
breathed
into
the
feeling
softness;
she
poured
round
the
passion
force.
Her
voice
was
fine
that
evening,
its
expression
dramatic.
She
impressed
all,
and
charmed
one.
On
leaving
the
instrument
she
went
to
the
fire,
and
sat
down
on
a
seat
semi
stool,
semi
cushion.
The
ladies
were
round
her;
none
of
them
spoke.
The
Misses
Sympson
and
the
Misses
Nunnely
looked
upon
her
as
quiet
poultry
might
look
on
an
egret,
an
ibis,
or
any
other
strange
fowl.
What
made
her
sing
so?
They
never
sang
so.
Was
it
proper
to
sing
with
such
expression,
with
such
originality
so
unlike
a
school
girl?
Decidedly
not.
It
was
strange,
it
was
unusual.
What
was
strange
must
be
wrong;
what
was
unusual
must
be
improper.
Shirley
was
judged.
Moreover,
old
Lady
Nunnely
eyed
her
stonily
from
her
great
chair
by
the
fireside.
