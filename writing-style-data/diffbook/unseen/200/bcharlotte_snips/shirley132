usual
affray
took
place
about
the
dinner,
which
meal,
when
Sarah
at
last
brought
it
into
the
room,
she
almost
flung
upon
the
table,
with
a
look
that
expressed
quite
plainly,
"I
never
dished
such
stuff
i'
my
life
afore;
it's
not
fit
for
dogs."
Notwithstanding
Sarah's
scorn,
it
was
a
savoury
repast
enough.
The
soup
was
a
sort
of
puree
of
dried
peas,
which
mademoiselle
had
prepared
amidst
bitter
lamentations
that
in
this
desolate
country
of
England
no
haricot
beans
were
to
be
had.
Then
came
a
dish
of
meat
nature
unknown,
but
supposed
to
be
miscellaneous
singularly
chopped
up
with
crumbs
of
bread,
seasoned
uniquely
though
not
unpleasantly,
and
baked
in
a
mould
a
queer
but
by
no
means
unpalatable
dish.
Greens,
oddly
bruised,
formed
the
accompanying
vegetable;
and
a
pate
of
fruit,
conserved
after
a
recipe
devised
by
Madame
Gerard
Moore's
"grand'mere,"
and
from
the
taste
of
which
it
appeared
probable
that
"melasse"
had
been
substituted
for
sugar,
completed
the
dinner.
Caroline
had
no
objection
to
this
Belgian
cookery
indeed
she
rather
liked
it
for
a
change;
and
it
was
well
she
did
so,
for
had
she
evinced
any
disrelish
thereof,
such
manifestation
would
have
injured
her
