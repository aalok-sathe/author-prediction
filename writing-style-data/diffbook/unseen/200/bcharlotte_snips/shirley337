Miss
Keeldar,
she
must
have
come
of
age
at
least
some
twenty
years
ago.
She
was
of
matronly
form,
and
though
she
wore
no
cap,
and
possessed
hair
of
quite
an
undimmed
auburn,
shading
small
and
naturally
young
looking
features,
she
had
no
youthful
aspect,
nor
apparently
the
wish
to
assume
it.
You
could
have
wished
her
attire
of
a
newer
fashion.
In
a
well
cut,
well
made
gown
hers
would
have
been
no
uncomely
presence.
It
puzzled
you
to
guess
why
a
garment
of
handsome
materials
should
be
arranged
in
such
scanty
folds,
and
devised
after
such
an
obsolete
mode.
You
felt
disposed
to
set
down
the
wearer
as
somewhat
eccentric
at
once.
This
lady
received
the
visitors
with
a
mixture
of
ceremony
and
diffidence
quite
English.
No
middle
aged
matron
who
was
not
an
Englishwoman
could
evince
precisely
the
same
manner
a
manner
so
uncertain
of
herself,
of
her
own
merits,
of
her
power
to
please,
and
yet
so
anxious
to
be
proper,
and,
if
possible,
rather
agreeable
than
otherwise.
In
the
present
instance,
however,
more
embarrassment
was
shown
than
is
usual
even
with
diffident
Englishwomen.
Miss
Helstone
felt
this,
sympathized
with
the
stranger,
and
knowing
by
experience
