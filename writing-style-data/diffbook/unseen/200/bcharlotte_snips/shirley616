thinking
when
I
inquired
after
the
wounded.
What
damage
have
your
opponents
sustained?"
"One
of
the
rioters,
or
victims
as
you
call
them,
was
killed,
and
six
were
hurt."
"What
have
you
done
with
them?"
"What
you
will
perfectly
approve.
Medical
aid
was
procured
immediately;
and
as
soon
as
we
can
get
a
couple
of
covered
wagons
and
some
clean
straw,
they
will
be
removed
to
Stilbro'."
"Straw!
You

I
will
send
my
wagon
directly,
properly

rioters
as
martyrs,
and

and
especially
Mr.
Helstone,
as
murderers

at
this
moment,
I
believe,
most
assiduously
engaged
in
fitting
it
up
with
feather
beds,
pillows,
bolsters,
blankets,
etc.
The
victims
lack
no
attentions,
I
promise
you.
Mr.
Hall,
your
favourite
parson,
has
been
with
them
ever
since
six
o'clock,
exhorting
them,
praying
with
them,
and
even
waiting
on
them
like
any
nurse;
and
Caroline's
good
friend,
Miss
Ainley,
that
very
plain
old
maid,
sent
in
a
stock
of
lint
and
linen,
something
in
the
proportion

lady's
