you
draw
a

I
never
witness
these
things
but
I
think
of
the
fable
of
Semele
reversed.
"It
is
not
the
daughter
of
Cadmus
I
see,
nor
do
I
realize
her
fatal
longing
to
look
on
Jove
in
the
majesty
of
his
god

It

by
that
lonely
watcher,
brave
and
unshaken

his
fanaticism.
In
the
midst
of
silence,
with
no
preluding
sound,
he
is
wrapped
in
sudden
light.

vast,
