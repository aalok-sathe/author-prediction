to
be?"
"The
wedding."
"Whose
wedding?"
"Only
that
of
Robert
Gerard
Moore,
Esq.,
of
Hollow's
Cottage,
with
Miss
Keeldar,
daughter
and
heiress
of
the
late
Charles
Cave
Keeldar
of
Fieldhead
Hall."
Shirley
gazed
at
the
questioner
with
rising
colour.
But
the
light
in
her
eye
was
not
faltering;
it
shone
steadily
yes,
it
burned
deeply.
"That
is
your
revenge,"
she
said
slowly;
then
added,
"Would
it
be
a
bad
match,
unworthy
of
the
late
Charles
Cave
Keeldar's
representative?"
"My
lass,
Moore
is
a
gentleman;
his
blood
is
pure
and
ancient
as
mine
or
thine."
"And
we
two
set
store
by
ancient
blood?
We
have
family
pride,
though
one
of
us
at
least
is
a
republican?"
Yorke
bowed
as
he
stood
before
her.
His
lips
were
mute,
but
his
eye
confessed
the
impeachment.
Yes,
he
had
family
pride;
you
saw
it
in
his
whole
bearing.
"Moore
is
a
gentleman,"
echoed
Shirley,
lifting
her
head
with
glad
grace.
She
checked
herself.
Words
seemed
crowding
to
her
tongue.
She
would
not
give
them
utterance;
but
her
look
spoke
much
at
the
moment.
What,
Yorke
tried
to
read,
but
could
not.
The
language
was
there,
visible,
but
untranslatable
a
poem,
a
fervid
lyric,
in
