mere
fire
of
dry
sticks,
blazing
up
and
vanishing.
But
we
watch
him,
and
see
him
kind
to
animals,
to
little
children,
to
poor
people.
He
is
kind
to
us
likewise,
good,
considerate.
He
does
not
flatter
women,
but
he
is
patient
with
them,
and
he
seems
to
be
easy
in
their
presence,
and
to
find
their
company
genial.
He
likes
them
not
only
for
vain
and
selfish
reasons,
but
as
we
like
him
because
we
like
him.
Then
we
observe
that
he
is
just,
that
he
always
speaks
the
truth,
that
he
is
conscientious.
We
feel
joy
and
peace
when
he
comes
into
a
room;
we
feel
sadness
and
trouble
when
he
leaves
it.
We
know
that
this
man
has
been
a
kind
son,
that
he
is
a
kind
brother.
Will
any
one
dare
to
tell
me
that
he
will
not
be
a
kind
husband?"
"My
uncle
would
affirm
it
unhesitatingly.
'He
will
be
sick
of
you
in
a
month,'
he
would
say."
"Mrs.
Pryor
would
seriously
intimate
the
same."
"Mrs.
Yorke
and
Miss
Mann
would
darkly
suggest
ditto."
"If
they
are
true
oracles,
it
is
good
never
to
fall
in
love."
"Very
good,
if
you
can
avoid
it."
