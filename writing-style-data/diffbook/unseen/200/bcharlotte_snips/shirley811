as
her
light
step
traversed
the
gallery
in
the
course
of
a
day,
it
did
not
again
pause
at
his
door;
nor
did
her
"cooing,
vibrating
voice"
disturb
a
second
time
the
hush
of
the
sickroom.
A
sickroom,
indeed,
it
soon
ceased
to
be;
Mr.
Moore's
good
constitution
quickly
triumphed
over
his
indisposition.
In
a
few
days
he
shook
it
off,
and
resumed
his
duties
as
tutor.
That
"auld
lang
syne"
had
still
its
authority
both
with
preceptor
and
scholar
was
proved
by
the
manner
in
which
he
sometimes
promptly
passed
the
distance
she
usually
maintained
between
them,
and
put
down
her
high
reserve
with
a
firm,
quiet
hand.
One
afternoon
the
Sympson
family
were
gone
out
to
take
a
carriage
airing.
Shirley,
never
sorry
to
snatch
a
reprieve
from
their
society,
had
remained
behind,
detained
by
business,
as
she
said.
The
business
a
little
letter
writing
was
soon
dispatched
after
the
yard
gates
had
closed
on
the
carriage;
Miss
Keeldar
betook
herself
to
the
garden.
It
was
a
peaceful
autumn
day.
The
gilding
of
the
Indian
summer
mellowed
the
pastures
far
and
wide.
The
russet
woods
stood
ripe
to
be
stripped,
but
were
yet
full
of
leaf.
The
purple
