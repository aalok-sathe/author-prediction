draws
nigh,
knows
that
it
is
God's
will
his
idol
shall
be
broken,
and
bends
his
head,
and
subdues
his
soul
to
the
sentence
he
cannot
avert
and
scarce
can
bear.
Happy
Mrs.
Pryor!
She
was
still
praying,
unconscious
that
the
summer
sun
hung
above
the
hills,
when
her
child
softly
woke
in
her
arms.
No
piteous,
unconscious
moaning
sound
which
so
wastes
our
strength
that,
even
if
we
have
sworn
to
be
firm,
a

into
realms

to
the
living.
Caroline
evidently
remembered
with
clearness
what
had
happened.
"Mamma,
I
have
slept
so
well.
I
only
dreamed
and
woke
twice."
Mrs.
Pryor
rose
with
a
start,
that
her
daughter
might
not
see
the
joyful
tears
called
into
her
eyes
by
that
affectionate
word
"mamma,"
and
the
welcome
assurance
that
followed
it.
For
many
days
the
mother
dared
rejoice
only
with
trembling.
That
first
revival
seemed
like
the
flicker
of
a
dying
lamp.
If
the
flame
streamed
up
bright
one
moment,
