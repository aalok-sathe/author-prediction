the
head
of
her
regiment
as
the
rector's
niece,
and
first
teacher
of
the
first
class;
obliged
to
make
tea
at
the
first
table
for
a
mixed
multitude
of
ladies
and
gentlemen,
and
to
do
all
this
without
the
countenance
of
mother,
aunt,
or
other
chaperon

approach
of

her
social
importance,

never
presuming
upon
it

be
enough
to
give
one
courage
only
to
look
at

The
only
fear
was
lest
the
heiress
should
not
be
punctual
to
tryst.
She
often
had
a
careless
way
of
lingering
behind
time,
and
Caroline
knew
her
uncle
would
not
wait
a
second

any
one.
At

the
church
clock

the
bells
