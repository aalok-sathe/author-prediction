the
kitchen.
No
need
to
give
him
directions;
he
was
always
at
home
everywhere.
Ere
long
he
reappeared,
carrying
a
round
table,
which
he
placed
under
the
cedar;
then
he
collected
six
garden
chairs
from
various
nooks
and
bowers
in
the
grounds,
and
placed
them
in
a
circle.
The
parlour
maid
Miss
Keeldar
kept
no
footman
came
out,
bearing
a
napkin
covered
tray.
Sweeting's
nimble
fingers
aided
in
disposing
glasses,
plates,
knives,
and
forks;
he
assisted
her
too
in
setting
forth
a
neat
luncheon,
consisting
of
cold
chicken,
ham,
and
tarts.
This
sort
of
impromptu
regale
it
was
Shirley's
delight
to
offer
any
chance
guests;
and
nothing
pleased
her
better
than
to
have
an
alert,
obliging
little
friend,
like
Sweeting,
to
run
about
her
hand,
cheerily
receive
and
briskly
execute
her
hospitable
hints.
David
and
she
were
on
the
best
terms
in
the
world;
and
his
devotion
to
the
heiress
was
quite
disinterested,
since
it
prejudiced
in
nothing
his
faithful
allegiance
to
the
magnificent
Dora
Sykes.
The
repast
turned
out
a
very
merry
one.
Donne
and
Malone,
indeed,
contributed
but
little
to
its
vivacity,
the
chief
part
they
played
in
it
being
what
concerned
the
knife,
fork,
and
wine
glass;
