is
fair;
she
has
a
pretty
white
slender
throat;
she
has
long
curls,
not
stiff
ones
they
hang
loose
and
soft,
their
colour
is
brown
but
not
dark;
she
speaks
quietly,
with
a
clear
tone;
she
never
makes
a
bustle
in
moving;
she
often
wears
a
gray
silk
dress;
she
is
neat
all
over
her
gowns,
and
her
shoes,
and
her
gloves
always
fit
her.
She
is
what
I
call
a
lady,
and
when
I
am
as
tall
as
she
is,
I
mean
to
be
like
her.
Shall
I
suit
you
if
I
am?
Will
you
really
marry
me?"
Moore
stroked
Jessy's
hair.
For
a
minute
he
seemed
as
if
he
would
draw
her
nearer
to
him,
but
instead
he
put
her
a
little
farther
off.
"Oh!
you
won't
have
me?
You
push
me
away."
"Why,
Jessy,
you
care
nothing
about
me.
You
never
come
to
see
me
now
at
the
Hollow."
"Because
you
don't
ask
me."
Hereupon
Mr.
Moore
gave
both
the
little
girls
an
invitation
to
pay
him
a
visit
next
day,
promising
that,
as
he
was
going
to
Stilbro'
in
the
morning,
he
would
buy
them
each
a
present,
of
what
nature
he
would
not
then
declare,
