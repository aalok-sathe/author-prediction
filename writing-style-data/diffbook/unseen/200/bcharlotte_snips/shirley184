Mrs.
and
Misses
Sykes,
far
from
being
exceptions
to
this
observation,
were
pointed
illustrations
of
its
truth.
Miss
Mary
a
well
looked,
well
meant,
and,
on
the
whole,
well
dispositioned
girl
wore
her
complacency
with
some
state,
though
without
harshness.
Miss
Harriet
a
beauty
carried
it
more
overbearingly;
she
looked
high
and
cold.
Miss
Hannah,
who
was
conceited,
dashing,
pushing,
flourished
hers
consciously
and
openly.
The
mother
evinced
it
with
the
gravity
proper
to
her
age
and
religious
fame.
The
reception
was
got

somehow.
Caroline
"was
glad
to
see

(an
unmitigated
fib),
hoped
they
were
well,
hoped
Mrs.
Sykes's
cough
was
better
(Mrs.
Sykes
had
had
a
cough
for
the
last
twenty
years),
hoped
the
Misses
Sykes
had
left
their
sisters
at
home
well;
to
which
inquiry
the
Misses
Sykes,
sitting
on
three
chairs
opposite
the
music
stool,
whereon
Caroline
had
undesignedly
come
to
anchor,
after
wavering
for
some
seconds
between
it
and
a
large
arm
chair,
into
which
she
at
length
recollected
she
ought
to
induct
Mrs.
Sykes
and
indeed
that
lady
saved
her
the
trouble
by
depositing
herself
therein

Misses
Sykes
replied

Caroline
