Caroline
hear
of
her
good
works,
but
she
knew
much
of
them
nevertheless.
Her
beneficence
was
the
familiar
topic
of
the
poor
in
Briarfield.
They
were
not
works
of
almsgiving.
The
old
maid
was
too
poor
to
give
much,
though
she
straitened
herself
to
privation
that
she
might
contribute
her
mite
when
needful.
They
were
the
works
of
a
Sister
of
Charity
far
more
difficult
to
perform
than
those
of
a
Lady
Bountiful.
She
would
watch
by
any
sick
bed;
she
seemed
to
fear
no
disease.
She
would
nurse
the
poorest
whom
none
else
would
nurse.
She
was
serene,
humble,
kind,
and
equable
through
everything.
For
this
goodness
she
got
but
little
reward
in
this
life.
Many
of
the
poor
became
so
accustomed
to
her
services
that
they
hardly
thanked
her
for
them.
The
rich
heard
them
mentioned
with
wonder,
but
were
silent,
from
a
sense
of
shame
at
the
difference
between
her
sacrifices
and
their
own.
Many
ladies,
however,
respected
her
deeply.
They
could
not
help
it.
One
gentleman
one
only
gave
her
his
friendship
and
perfect
confidence.
This
was
Mr.
Hall,
the
vicar
of
Nunnely.
He
said,
and
said
truly,
that
her
life
came
nearer
the
life
of
