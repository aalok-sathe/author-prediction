her
better
than
a
simpler
costume;
the
deep
embroidered
scarf
became
her.
She
wore
it
negligently
but
gracefully.
The
wreath
on
her
bonnet
crowned
her
well.
The
attention
to
fashion,
the
tasteful
appliance
of
ornament
in
each
portion
of
her
dress,
were
quite
in
place
with
her.
All
this
suited

like
the
frank
light
in
her
eyes,

rallying
smile

her
lips,

in

for
all
to
assemble.
The
trooping
in
of
numbers,
the
trampling
of
many
steps
and
murmuring
of
many
voices,
were
likewise
audible.
From
a
rising
ground,
they
presently
saw,
on
the
Whinbury
road,
the
Whinbury
school
approaching.
It
numbered
five
hundred
souls.
The
rector
and
curate,
Boultby
and
Donne,
headed

full
canonicals,
