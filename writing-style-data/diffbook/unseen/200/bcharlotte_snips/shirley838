touched
as
well
as
alarmed.
To
all
comparative
strangers
who,
unconscious
of
the
alterations
in
her
spirits,
commented
on
the
alteration
in
her
looks,
she
had
one
reply,
"I
am
perfectly
well;
I
have
not
an
ailment."
And
health,
indeed,
she
must
have
had,
to
be
able
to
bear
the
exposure
to
the
weather
she
now
encountered.
Wet
or
fair,
calm
or
storm,
she
took
her
daily
ride
over
Stilbro'
Moor,
Tartar
keeping
up
at
her
side,
with
his
wolf
like
gallop,
long
and
untiring.
Twice,
three
times,
the
eyes
of
gossips
those
eyes
which
are
everywhere,
in
the
closet
and
on
the
hill
top
noticed
that
instead
of
turning
on
Rushedge,
the
top
ridge
of
Stilbro'
Moor,
she
rode
forwards
all
the
way
to
the
town.
Scouts
were
not
wanting
to
mark
her
destination
there.
It
was
ascertained
that
she
alighted
at
the
door
of
one
Mr.
Pearson
Hall,
a
solicitor,
related
to
the
vicar
of
Nunnely.
This
gentleman
and
his
ancestors
had
been
the
agents
of
the
Keeldar
family
for
generations
back.
Some
people
affirmed
that
Miss
Keeldar
was
become
involved
in
business
speculations
connected
with
Hollow's
Mill
that
she
had
lost
money,
and
was
constrained
to
mortgage
