a
brute
and
such
a
puppy."
"Tut!"
said
the
imperturbable
Yorke,
"you
make
too
much
of
it;
but
still,
I
say,
I
am
capped.
Firstly,
that
she
did
not
love
you;
and
secondly,
that
you
did
not
love
her.
You
are
both
young;
you
are
both
handsome;
you

she
is
so
playful,
pleasant,
and
eloquent.
I
have
watched
her
when
she
was
most
natural,
most
lively,
and
most
lovely;
my
judgment
has
pronounced
her
beautiful.
Beautiful
she
is
at
times,
when
her
mood
and
her
array
partake
of
the
splendid.
I
have
drawn
a
little
nearer,
feeling
that

terms
of
acquaintance
