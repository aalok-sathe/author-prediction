unnoticed
by
him.
He
could
walk
miles
on
the
most
varying
April
day
and
never
see
the
beautiful
dallying
of
earth
and
heaven
never
mark
when
a
sunbeam
kissed
the
hill
tops,
making
them
smile
clear
in
green
light,
or
when
a
shower
wept
over
them,
hiding
their
crests
with
the
low
hanging,
dishevelled
tresses
of
a
cloud.
He
did
not,
therefore,
care
to
contrast
the
sky
as
it
now
appeared
a
muffled,
streaming
vault,
all
black,
save

ask
where
the
constellations

of
the

which
those
white
islets
stud,
and
which
another
ocean,
of
heavier
and
denser
element,
now
rolled
below
and
concealed.
He
just
doggedly
pursued
his
way,
leaning
a
little
forward
as
he
walked,
and
wearing
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head,
as
his
Irish
manner
was.
"Tramp,
tramp,"
he
went
along
the
causeway,
where
the
road
boasted
the
privilege
of
such
an
accommodation;
"splash,
splash,"
through
the
mire
