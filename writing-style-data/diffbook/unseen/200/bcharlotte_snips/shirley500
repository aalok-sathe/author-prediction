picture
in
which
sweetness
of
tint,
purity
of
air,
and
grace
of
mien
atoned
for
the
absence
of
rich
colouring
and
magnificent
contour.
What
her
brown
eye
and
clear
forehead
showed
of
her
mind
was
in
keeping
with
her
dress
and
face
modest,
gentle,
and,
though
pensive,
harmonious.
It
appeared
that
neither
lamb
nor
dove
need
fear
her,
but
would
welcome
rather,
in
her
look
of
simplicity
and
softness,
a
sympathy
with
their
own
natures,
or

them.
After
all,
she
was
an
imperfect,
faulty
human
being,
fair

the
withered

Ainley,
now
putting
on
her
best
black
gown
and
Quaker
drab
shawl
and
bonnet
in
her
own
narrow
cottage
chamber.
Away
Caroline
went,
across
some
very
sequestered
fields
and
through
some
quite
hidden
lanes,
to
Fieldhead.
She
glided
quickly
under
the
green
hedges
and
across
the
greener
leas.
There
was
no
dust,
no
moisture,
to
soil
the
hem
of
her
stainless
garment,
or
to
damp
her
slender
sandal.
After
the
late
rains
all
was
clean,
and
under
the
present
glowing
sun
all
was
dry.
She
