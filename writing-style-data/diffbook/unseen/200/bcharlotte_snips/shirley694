submit
humbly
to
the
superior
sense
of
the
individual
then
addressing
her.
Fortunately
for
her
audience,
she
had
not
harangued
above
ten
minutes
when
Sarah's
entrance
with
the
tea
tray
called
her
attention,
first
to
the
fact
of
that
damsel
having
a
gilt
comb
in
her
hair
and
a
red
necklace
round
her
throat,
and
secondly,
and
subsequently
to
a
pointed
remonstrance,
to
the
duty
of
making
tea.
After
the
meal
Rose
restored
her
to
good
humour
by
bringing
her
guitar
and
asking
for
a
song,
and
afterwards
engaging
her
in
an
intelligent
and
sharp
cross
examination
about
guitar
playing
and
music
in
general.
Jessie,
meantime,
directed
her
assiduities
to
Caroline.
Sitting
on
a
stool
at
her
feet,
she
talked
to
her,
first
about
religion
and
then
about
politics.
Jessie
was
accustomed
at
home
to
drink
in
a
great
deal
of
what
her
father
said
on
these
subjects,
and
afterwards
in
company
to
retail,
with
more
wit
and
fluency
than
consistency
or
discretion,
his
opinions,
antipathies,
and
preferences.
She
rated
Caroline
soundly
for
being
a
member
of
the
Established
Church,
and
for
having
an
uncle
a
clergyman.
She
informed
her
that
she
lived
on
the
country,
and
ought
to
work
