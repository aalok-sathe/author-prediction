will
be
coming
out
to
take
his
usual
sentinel
round,
and
he
always
surveys
the
church
and
churchyard."
"And
if
he
does?
If
it
were
not
for
Fanny,
who
knows
we
are
here,
I
should
find
pleasure
in
dodging
and
eluding
him.
We
could
be
under
the
east
window
when
he
is
at
the
porch;
as
he
came
round
to
the
north
side
we
could
wheel
off
to
the
south;
we
might
at
a
pinch
hide

some

the
monuments.

tall
erection
of
the
Wynnes

screen
us
completely."
"Robert,

to
go;
on
the
contrary,
I

uncle
will
be
terribly
angry.
He

to
see
you
because
you
are
a
Jacobin."
"A
queer
Jacobin!"
"Go,
Robert,
he
is
coming;
I
hear
him
cough."
"Diable!
It
is
strange
what
a
pertinacious
wish
I
feel
to
stay!"
"You
remember
what
he
did
to
Fanny's
"
began
Caroline,
and
stopped
abruptly
short.
"Sweetheart"
was
the
word
that
ought
to
have
followed,
but
she
could
not
utter
it.
It
seemed
calculated
to
suggest
ideas
