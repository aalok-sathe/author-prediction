room,
in
the
way
that
she
only
does,
and
no
other
woman,
and
ejaculated,
'God
bless
me!'
"Yorke,
I
stood
on
the
hearth,
backed
by
the
mantelpiece;
against
it
I
leaned,
and
prepared
for
anything
everything.
I
knew
my
doom,
and
I
knew
myself.
There
was
no
misunderstanding
her
aspect
and
voice.
She
stopped
and
looked
at
me.
"'God
bless
me!'
she
piteously
repeated,
in
that
shocked,
indignant,
yet
saddened
accent.
'You
have
made
a
strange
proposal
strange
from
you;
and
if
you
knew
how
strangely
you
worded
it
and
looked
it,
you
would
be
startled
at
yourself.
You
spoke
like
a
brigand
who
demanded
my
purse
rather
than
like
a
lover
who
asked
my
heart.'
"A
queer
sentence,
was
it
not,
Yorke?
And
I
knew,
as
she
uttered
it,
it
was
true
as
queer.
Her
words
were
a
mirror
in
which
I
saw
myself.
"I
looked
at
her,
dumb
and
wolfish.
She
at
once
enraged
and
shamed
me.
"'Gerard
Moore,
you
know
you
don't
love
Shirley
Keeldar.'
I
might
have
broken
out
into
false
swearing
vowed
that
I
did
love
her;
but
I
could
not
lie
in
her
pure
face.
I
could
not
perjure
myself
in
her
truthful
presence.
