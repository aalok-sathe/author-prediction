We
perished
each
alone!
But
I
beneath
a
rougher
sea,
And
whelmed
in
deeper
gulfs
than
he."
"I
hope
William
Cowper
is
safe
and
calm
in
heaven
now,"
said
Caroline.
"Do
you
pity
what
he
suffered
on
earth?"
asked
Miss
Keeldar.
"Pity
him,
Shirley?
What
can
I
do
else?
He
was
nearly
broken
hearted
when
he
wrote
that
poem,
and
it
almost
breaks
one's
heart
to
read
it.
But
he
found
relief
in
writing
it
I
know
he
did;
and

gift
of
poetry
the
most

allay
emotions
when
their
strength
threatens
harm.
It
seems
to

Shirley,
that
nobody
should
write
poetry
to
exhibit
intellect
or

Who
cares
for
that
sort
of
poetry?
Who
cares
for
learning
who
cares
for
fine
words
in
poetry?
And
who
does
not
care
for
feeling
real
feeling
however
simply,
even
rudely
expressed?"
"It
seems
you
care
for
it,
at
all
events;
and
certainly,
in
hearing
that
poem,
one
discovers
that
Cowper
was
under
an
impulse
strong
as
that
of
the
wind
which
drove
the
ship
an
impulse
which,
while
it
would
not
suffer
him
to
stop
to
add
ornament
to
a
single
stanza,
