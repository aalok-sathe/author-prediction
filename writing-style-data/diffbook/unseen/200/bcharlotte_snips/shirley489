Boultby's

I
approve,

I
repeat,

for

Donne
was
thick
skinned.
He
did
not
feel
all
or
half
that
the
tone,

the
speaker

He
knew

(you
must
excuse
Mr.
Donne's
pronunciation,
reader;
it

very
choice;
he
considered
it
genteel,
and
prided
himself
on
his
southern
accent;
northern
ears
received
with
singular

his
utterance
of
certain
