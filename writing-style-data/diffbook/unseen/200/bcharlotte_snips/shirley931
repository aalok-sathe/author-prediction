Sympson,
assuming
vast
courage
and
consequence
on
the
strength
of
this
symptom
of
confusion.
"It
was
an
historical
picture,
uncle,
from
several
originals."
"Several
originals!
Bless
my
heart!"
"I
have
been
in
love
several
times."
"This
is
cynical."
"With
heroes
of
many
nations."
"What
next
"
"And
philosophers."
"She
is
mad
"
"Don't
ring
the
bell,
uncle;
you
will
alarm
my
aunt."
"Your
poor
dear
aunt,
what
a
niece
has
she!"
"Once
I
loved
Socrates."
"Pooh!
no
trifling,
ma'am."
"I
admired
Themistocles,
Leonidas,
Epaminondas."
"Miss
Keeldar
"
"To
pass
over
a
few
centuries,
Washington
was
a
plain
man,
but
I
liked
him;
but
to
speak
of
the
actual
present
"
"Ah!
the
actual
present."
"To
quit
crude
schoolgirl
fancies,
and
come
to
realities."
"Realities!
That
is
the
test
to
which
you
shall
be
brought,
ma'am."
"To
avow
before
what
altar
I
now
kneel
to
reveal
the
present
idol
of
my
soul
"
"You
will
make
haste
about
it,
if
you
please.
It
is
near
luncheon
time,
and
confess
you
shall."
"Confess
I
must.
My
heart
is
full
of
the
secret.
It
must
be
spoken.
I
only
wish
you
were
Mr.
Helstone
instead
of
Mr.
Sympson;
you
would
sympathize
with
me
