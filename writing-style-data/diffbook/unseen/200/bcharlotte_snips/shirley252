quite
ordinary,
commonplace
beings;
and
they
were
not.
You
see
six
of
them,
reader.
The
youngest
is
a
baby
on
the
mother's
knee.
It
is
all
her
own
yet,
and
that
one
she
has
not
yet
begun
to
doubt,
suspect,
condemn;
it
derives
its
sustenance
from
her,
it
hangs
on
her,
it
clings
to
her,
it
loves
her
above
everything
else
in
the
world.
She
is
sure
of
that,
because,
as
it
lives
by
her,
it
cannot
be
otherwise,
therefore
she
loves
it.
The
two
next
are
girls,
Rose
and
Jessy;
they
are
both
now
at
their
father's
knee;
they
seldom
go
near
their
mother,
except
when
obliged
to
do
so.
Rose,
the
elder,
is
twelve
years
old;
she
is
like
her
father
the
most
like
him
of
the
whole
group
but
it
is
a
granite
head
copied
in
ivory;
all
is
softened
in
colour
and
line.
Yorke
himself
has
a
harsh
face
his
daughter's
is
not
harsh,
neither
is
it
quite
pretty;
it
is
simple,
childlike
in
feature;
the
round
cheeks
bloom:
as
to
the
gray
eyes,
they
are
otherwise
than
childlike;
a
serious
soul
lights
them
a
young
soul
yet,
but
it
will
mature,
if
the
body
lives;
