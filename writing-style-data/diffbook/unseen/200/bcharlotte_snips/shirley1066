(you
cannot
know
how
it
happened,
reader;
your
curiosity
must
be
robbed
to
pay
your
elegant
love
of
the
pretty
and
pleasing),
there
came
as
his
successor
another
Irish
curate,
Mr.
Macarthey.
I
am
happy
to
be
able
to
inform
you,
with
truth,
that
this
gentleman
did
as
much
credit
to
his
country
as
Malone
had
done
it
discredit.
He
proved
himself
as
decent,
decorous,
and
conscientious
as
Peter
was
rampant,
boisterous,
and
This
last
epithet
I
choose
to
suppress,
because
it
would
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag.
He
laboured
faithfully
in
the
parish.
The
schools,
both
Sunday
and
day
schools,
flourished
under
his
sway
like
green
bay
trees.
Being
human,
of
course
he
had
his
faults.
These,
however,
were
proper,
steady
going,
clerical
faults
what
many
would
call
virtues.
The
circumstance
of
finding
himself
invited
to
tea
with
a
Dissenter
would
unhinge
him
for
a
week.
The
spectacle
of
a
Quaker
wearing
his
hat
in
the
church,
the
thought
of
an
unbaptized
fellow
creature
being
interred
with
Christian
rites
these
things
could
make
strange
havoc
in
Mr.
Macarthey's
physical
and
mental
economy.
Otherwise
he
was
sane
and
rational,
diligent
and
charitable.
I
doubt
not
a
justice
loving
