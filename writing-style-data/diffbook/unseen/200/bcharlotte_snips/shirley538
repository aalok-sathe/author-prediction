her
eyes.
"Oh,
that
is
soon
remedied!"
exclaimed
Shirley:
"we'll
make
him
bid
us
good
bye."
"Make
him!
That
is
not
the
same
thing,"
was
the
answer.
"It
shall
be
the
same
thing."
"But
he
is
gone;
you
can't
overtake
him."
"I
know
a
shorter
way
than
that
he
has
taken.
We
will
intercept
him."
"But,
Shirley,
I
would
rather
not
go."
Caroline
said
this
as
Miss
Keeldar
seized
her
arm
and
hurried
her
down
the
fields.
It
was
vain
to
contend.
Nothing
was
so
wilful
as
Shirley
when
she
took
a
whim
into
her
head.
Caroline
found
herself
out
of
sight
of
the
crowd
almost
before
she
was
aware,
and
ushered
into
a
narrow
shady
spot,
embowered
above
with
hawthorns,
and
enamelled
under
foot
with
daisies.
She
took
no
notice
of
the
evening
sun
chequering
the
turf,
nor
was
she
sensible
of
the
pure
incense
exhaling
at
this
hour
from
tree
and
plant;
she
only
heard
the
wicket
opening
at
one
end,
and
knew
Robert
was
approaching.
The
long
sprays
of
the
hawthorns,
shooting
out
before
them,
served
as
a
screen.
They
saw
him
before
he
observed
them.
At
a
glance
Caroline
perceived
that
his
social
hilarity
was
gone;
