are
other
visitors
coming,"
observed
Shirley,
with
that
provoking
coolness
which
the
owners
of
formidable
looking
dogs
are
apt
to
show
while
their
animals
are
all
bristle
and
bay.
Tartar
sprang
down
the
pavement
towards
the
gate,
bellowing
avec
explosion.
His
mistress
quietly
opened
the
glass
door,
and
stepped
out
chirruping
to
him.
His
bellow
was
already
silenced,
and
he
was
lifting
up
his
huge,
blunt,
stupid
head
to
the
new
callers
to
be
patted.
"What!
Tartar,
Tartar!"
said
a
cheery,
rather
boyish
voice,
"don't

know

And
little
Mr.
Sweeting,
whose
conscious
good
nature
made
him
comparatively
fearless
of

no
ill
will
to
him.
He
snuffed
both
the
gentlemen
round,
and
then,
as
if
concluding
that
they
were
harmless,
and
might
be
allowed
to
pass,
he
withdrew
to
the
sunny
front
of
the
hall,
leaving
the
archway
free.
Mr.
Sweeting
followed,
and
would
have
played
with
him;
but
Tartar
took
no
notice
of
his
caresses.
It
was
only
his
mistress's
