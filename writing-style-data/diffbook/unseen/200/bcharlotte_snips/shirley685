and
spouting
about
it,
then?"
"Am
I
to
do
nothing
but
that?
I
will
do
that,
and
then
I
will
do
more.
Now,
mother,
I
have
said
my
say.
I
am
twelve
years
old
at
present,
and
not
till
I
am
sixteen
will
I
speak
again
about
talents.
For
four
years
I
bind
myself
an
industrious
apprentice
to
all
you
can
teach
me."
"You
see
what
my
daughters
are,
Miss
Helstone,"
observed
Mrs.
Yorke;
"how
precociously
wise
in

own
conceits!
'I
would

this,
I
prefer
that'

is
Jessie's

Rose
utters

cry,
'I
will,
and
I
will

"I
render
a
reason,
mother;
besides,
if
my
cry
is
bold,
it
is
only
heard
once
in
a
twelvemonth.
About
each
birthday
the
spirit
moves
me
to
deliver
one
oracle
respecting
my
own
instruction
and
management.
I
utter
it
and
leave
it;
it
is
for
you,
mother,
to
listen
or
not."
"I
would
advise
all
young
ladies,"
pursued
Mrs.
Yorke,
"to
study
the
characters
of
such
children
as
they
chance
to
meet
with
before
they
marry
and
have
any
of
their
own
to
consider
well
how
they
would
like
the
responsibility
of
guiding
the
