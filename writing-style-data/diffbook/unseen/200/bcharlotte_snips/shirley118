I
cannot
tell.
I
suppose
to
keep
my
uncle's
house
till
"
She
hesitated.
"Till
what?
Till
he
dies?"
"No.
How
harsh
to
say
that!
I
never
think
of
his
dying.
He
is
only
fifty
five.
But
till
in
short,
till
events
offer
other
occupations
for
me."
"A
remarkably
vague
prospect!
Are
you
content
with
it?"
"I
used
to
be,
formerly.
Children,
you
know,
have
little
reflection,
or
rather
their
reflections
run
on
ideal
themes.
There
are
moments
now
when
I
am
not
quite
satisfied."
"Why?"
"I
am
making
no
money
earning
nothing."
"You
come
to
the

Lina.
You
too,
then,
wish
to
make
money?"
"I
do.
I
should
like
an
occupation;
and
if
I
were
a
boy,
it
would
not
be
so
difficult
to
find
one.
I
see
such
an
easy,
pleasant
way
of
learning
a
business,
and
making
my
way
in
life."
"Go
on.
Let
us
hear
what
way."
"I
could
be
apprenticed
to
your
trade
the
cloth
trade.
I
could
learn
it
of
you,
as
we
are
distant
relations.
I
would
do
the
counting
house
work,
keep
the
books,
and
write
the
letters,
while
you
went
to
market.
I
know
you
greatly
desire
to
be
rich,
