to
blame,
that
I
can
see,
for
the
state
in
which
things
are;
and
I
cannot
tell,
however
much
I
puzzle
over
it,
how
they
are
to
be
altered
for
the
better;
but
I
feel
there
is
something
wrong
somewhere.
I
believe
single
women
should
have
more
to
do
better
chances
of
interesting
and
profitable
occupation
than
they
possess
now.
And
when
I
speak
thus
I
have
no
impression
that
I
displease
God
by
my
words;
that
I
am
either
impious
or
impatient,
irreligious
or
sacrilegious.
My
consolation
is,
indeed,
that
God
hears
many
a
groan,
and
compassionates
much
grief
which
man
stops
his
ears
against,
or
frowns
on
with
impotent
contempt.
I
say
impotent,
for
I
observe
that
to
such
grievances
as
society
cannot
readily
cure
it
usually
forbids
utterance,
on
pain
of
its
scorn,
this
scorn
being
only
a
sort
of
tinselled
cloak
to
its
deformed
weakness.
People
hate
to
be
reminded
of
ills
they
are
unable
or
unwilling
to
remedy.
Such
reminder,
in
forcing
on
them
a
sense
of
their
own
incapacity,
or
a
more
painful
sense
of
an
obligation
to
make
some
unpleasant
effort,
troubles
their
ease
and
shakes
their
self
complacency.
