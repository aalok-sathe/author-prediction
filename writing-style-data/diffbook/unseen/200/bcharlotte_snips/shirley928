could
not
obey
a
youth
like
Sir
Philip.
Besides,
he
would
never
command
me.
He
would
expect
me
always
to
rule
to
guide
and
I
have
no
taste
whatever
for
the
office."
"You
no
taste
for
swaggering,
and
subduing,
and
ordering,
and
ruling?"
"Not
my
husband;
only
my
uncle."
"Where
is
the
difference?"
"There
is
a
slight
difference
that
is
certain.
And
I
know
full
well
any
man
who
wishes
to
live
in
decent
comfort
with
me
as
a
husband
must
be
able
to
control
me."
"I
wish
you
had
a
real
tyrant."
"A
tyrant
would
not
hold
me
for
a
day,
not
for
an
hour.
I
would
rebel
break
from
him
defy
him."
"Are
you
not
enough
to
bewilder
one's
brain
with
your
self
contradiction?"
"It
is
evident
I
bewilder
your
brain."
"You
talk
of
Sir
Philip
being
young.
He
is
two
and
twenty."
"My
husband
must
be
thirty,
with
the
sense
of
forty."
"You
had
better
pick
out
some
old
man
some
white
headed
or
bald
headed
swain."
"No,
thank
you."
"You
could
lead
some
doting
fool;
you
might
pin
him
to
your
apron."
"I
might
do
that
with
a
boy;
but
it
is
not
my
vocation.
