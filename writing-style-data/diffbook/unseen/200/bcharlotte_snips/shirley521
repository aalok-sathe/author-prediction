from
the
coppers
of
the
rector's
kitchen.
The
profusion
of
flowers
and
evergreens
decorating
the
white
walls,
the
show
of
silver
teapots
and
bright
porcelain
on
the
tables,
the
active
figures,
blithe
faces,
gay
dresses
flitting
about
everywhere,
formed
altogether
a
refreshing
and

curls,
falling

served
almost
in
place
of
a
veil;
and
for
the
rest,
her
muslin
dress
was
fashioned
modestly
as
a
nun's
robe,
enabling
her
thus
to
dispense
with
the
encumbrance
of
a
shawl.
The
room
was
