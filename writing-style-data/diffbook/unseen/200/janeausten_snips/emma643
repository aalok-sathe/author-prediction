certainty
of
its
being
already
formed.
Harriet
behaved
extremely
well
on
the
occasion,
with
great
self
command.
What
ever
she
might
feel
of
brighter
hope,
she
betrayed
nothing.
Emma
was
gratified,
to
observe
such
a
proof
in
her
of
strengthened
character,
and
refrained
from
any
allusion
that
might
endanger
its
maintenance.
They
spoke,
therefore,
of
Mrs.
Churchill's
death
with
mutual
forbearance.
Short
letters
from
Frank
were
received
at
Randalls,
communicating
all
that
was
immediately
important
of
their
state
and
plans.
Mr.
Churchill
was
better
than
could
be
expected;
and
their
first
removal,
on
the
departure
of
the

the
house
of
a
very
old
friend
in
Windsor,
to
whom
Mr.
Churchill
had
been
promising
a
visit
the
last
ten
years.
At

there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
Harriet;
good
wishes
for
the
future
were
all
that
could
yet
be
possible
on
Emma's
side.
It
was
a
more
pressing
concern
to
shew
attention
to
Jane
Fairfax,
whose
prospects
were
closing,
while
Harriet's
opened,
and
whose
engagements
now
allowed
of
no
delay
in
any
one
at
Highbury,
who
wished
to
shew
her
kindness
and
with
Emma
it
was
grown
into
a
first
wish.
She
