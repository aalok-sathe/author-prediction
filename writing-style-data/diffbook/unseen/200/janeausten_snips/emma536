figure,
among
the
bulky
forms
and
stooping
shoulders
of
the
elderly
men,
was
such
as
Emma
felt
must
draw
every
body's
eyes;
and,
excepting
her
own
partner,
there
was
not
one
among
the
whole
row
of
young
men
who
could
be
compared
with
him.
He
moved
a
few
steps
nearer,
and
those
few
steps
were
enough
to
prove
in
how
gentlemanlike
a
manner,
with
what
natural
grace,
he
must
have
danced,

he

take
the
trouble.
Whenever
she
caught
his
eye,
she
forced
him
to
smile;
but
in

he
was
looking
grave.
She
wished

better,
and
could

better.
He
seemed
often
observing
her.
She
must
not
flatter
herself
that
he
thought
of
her

but
if
he
were
criticising
her
behaviour,
she
did
not
feel
afraid.
There
was
nothing
like
flirtation
between
her
and
her
partner.
They
seemed
more
like
cheerful,
easy
friends,
than
lovers.
That
Frank
Churchill
thought
less
of
her
than
he
had
done,
was
indubitable.
The
ball
proceeded
pleasantly.
The
anxious
cares,
the
incessant
attentions
of
Mrs.
Weston,
were
not
thrown
away.
Every
body
seemed
happy;
and
the
praise
of
being
a
delightful
ball,
