own.
But
never
did
she
go
without
Mr.
Woodhouse's
giving
a
gentle
sigh,
and
saying,
"Ah,
poor
Miss
Taylor!
She
would
be
very
glad
to
stay."
There
was
no
recovering
Miss
Taylor
nor
much
likelihood
of
ceasing
to
pity
her;
but
a
few
weeks
brought
some
alleviation
to
Mr.
Woodhouse.
The
compliments
of
his
neighbours
were
over;
he
was
no
longer
teased
by
being
wished
joy
of
so
sorrowful
an
event;
and
the
wedding
cake,
which
had
been
a
great
distress
to
him,
was
all
eat
up.
His
own
stomach
could
bear
nothing
rich,
and
he
could
never
believe
other
people
to
be
different
from
himself.
What
was
unwholesome
to
him
he
regarded
as
unfit
for
any
body;
and
he
had,
therefore,
earnestly
tried
to
dissuade
them
from
having
any
wedding
cake
at
all,
and
when
that
proved
vain,
as
earnestly
tried
to
prevent
any
body's
eating
it.
He
had
been
at
the
pains
of
consulting
Mr.
Perry,
the
apothecary,
on
the
subject.
Mr.
Perry
was
an
intelligent,
gentlemanlike
man,
whose
frequent
visits
were
one
of
the
comforts
of
Mr.
Woodhouse's
life;
and
upon
being
applied
to,
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
(though
it
seemed
rather
against
the
bias
of
