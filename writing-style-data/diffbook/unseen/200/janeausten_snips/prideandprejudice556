Miss
Bennet,
I
insist
on
being
satisfied.
Has
he,
has
my
nephew,
made
you
an
offer
of
marriage?"
"Your
ladyship
has
declared
it
to
be
impossible."
"It
ought
to
be
so;
it
must
be
so,
while
he
retains
the
use
of
his
reason.
But
your
arts
and
allurements
may,

"Miss
Bennet,

you
know
who
I

he
has

entitled
to
know
all
his
dearest
concerns."
"But
you
are
not
entitled
to
know
mine;
nor
will
such
behaviour
as
this,
ever
induce
me
to
be
explicit."
"Let
me
be
rightly
understood.
This
match,
to
which
you
have
the
presumption
to
aspire,
can
never
take
place.
No,
never.
Mr.
Darcy
is
engaged
to
my
daughter.
Now
what
have
you
to
say?"
"Only
this;
that
if
he
is
so,
you
can
have
no
reason
to
suppose
he
will
make
an
offer
to
