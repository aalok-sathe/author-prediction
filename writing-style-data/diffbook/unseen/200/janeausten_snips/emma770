there
was
a
dentist
to
be
consulted;
but,
since
that
business
had
been
over,
she
did
not
appear
to
find
Harriet
different
from
what
she
had
known
her
before.
Isabella,
to
be
sure,
was
no
very
quick
observer;
yet
if
Harriet
had
not
been
equal
to
playing
with
the
children,
it
would
not
have
escaped
her.
Emma's
comforts
and
hopes
were
most
agreeably
carried
on,
by
Harriet's
being
to
stay
longer;
her
fortnight
was
likely
to
be
a

Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Knightley
were
to

August,
and
she
was
invited
to
remain
till
they
could
bring
her
back.
"John
does
not
even
mention

said
Mr.
Knightley.
"Here

to
see
it."
It
was
the
answer
to
the
communication
of
his
intended
marriage.
Emma
accepted
it
with
a
very
eager
hand,
with
an
impatience
all
alive
to
know
what
he
would
say
about
it,
and
not
at
all
checked
by
hearing
that
her
friend
was
unmentioned.
"John
enters
like
a
brother
into
my
happiness,"
continued
Mr.
Knightley,
"but
he
is
no
complimenter;
and
though
I
well
know
him
to
have,
likewise,
a
most
brotherly
affection
for
you,
