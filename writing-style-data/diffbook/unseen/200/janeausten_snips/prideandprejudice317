particularly
to
the
testimony
of
Colonel
Fitzwilliam,
who,
from
our
near
relationship
and
constant
intimacy,
and,
still
more,
as
one
of
the
executors
of
my
father's
will,
has
been
unavoidably
acquainted
with
every
particular
of
these
transactions.
If
your
abhorrence
of
me
should
make
my
assertions
valueless,
you
cannot
be
prevented
by
the
same
cause
from
confiding
in
my
cousin;
and
that
there
may
be
the
possibility
of
consulting
him,
I
shall

to
find

this
letter
in
your
hands
in
the
course
of
the
morning.
I
will
only
add,
God
bless
you.

contents.
But
such
as
they
were,
it
may
well
be
supposed
how
eagerly
she
went
through
them,
and
what
a
contrariety
of
emotion
they
excited.
Her
feelings
as
she
read
were
scarcely
to
be
defined.
With
amazement
did
she
first
understand
that
he
believed
any
apology
to
be
in
his
power;
and
steadfastly
was
she
persuaded,
that
he
could
have
no
explanation
to
give,
which
a
just
sense
of
shame
would
