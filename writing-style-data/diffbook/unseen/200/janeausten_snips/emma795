One
cannot
call
her
fair.
It
is
a
most
uncommon
complexion,
with
her
dark
eye
lashes
and
hair
a
most
distinguishing
complexion!
So
peculiarly
the
lady
in
it.
Just
colour
enough
for
beauty."
"I
have
always
admired
her
complexion,"
replied
Emma,
archly;
"but
do
not
I
remember
the
time
when
you
found
fault
with
her
for
being
so
pale?
When
we

"Oh!
no

"Oh!
no,
no,
no
how
can
you
suspect
me
of
such
a
thing?
I
was
the
most
miserable
wretch!"
"Not
quite
so
miserable
as
to
be
insensible
to
mirth.
I
am
sure
it
was
a
source
of
high
entertainment
to
you,
to
feel
that
you
were
taking
us
all

Perhaps
