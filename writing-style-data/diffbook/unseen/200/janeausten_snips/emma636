however,'
said
she;
'give
it
houseroom
till
Colonel
Campbell
comes
back.
I
shall
talk
about
it
to
him;
he
will
settle
for
me;
he
will
help
me
out
of
all
my
difficulties.'
And
to
this
day,
I
do
believe,
she
knows
not
whether
it
was
his
present
or
his
daughter's."
Now
Emma
was
obliged
to
think
of
the
pianoforte;
and
the
remembrance
of
all
her
former
fanciful
and
unfair
conjectures
was
so
little
pleasing,
that
she
soon
allowed
herself
to
believe
her
visit
had
been
long
enough;
and,
with
a
repetition
of
every
thing
that
she
could
venture
to
say
of
the
good
wishes
which
she
really
felt,
took
leave.
Emma's
pensive
meditations,
as
she
walked
home,
were
not
interrupted;
but
on
entering
the
parlour,
she
found
those
who
must
rouse
her.
Mr.
Knightley
and
Harriet
had
arrived
during
her
absence,
and
were
sitting
with
her
father.
Mr.
Knightley
immediately
got
up,
and
in
a
manner
decidedly
graver
than
usual,
said,
"I
would
not
go
away
without
seeing
you,
but
I
have
no
time
to
spare,
and
therefore
must
now
be
gone
directly.
I
am
going
to
London,
to
spend
a
few
days
with
John
and
Isabella.
Have
you
any
