Miss
Fairfax's
confidence,
and
fancying
herself
acquainted
with
what
was
still
a
secret
to
other
people.
Emma
saw
symptoms
of
it
immediately
in
the
expression
of
her
face;
and
while
paying
her
own
compliments
to
Mrs.
Bates,
and
appearing
to
attend
to
the
good
old
lady's
replies,
she
saw
her
with
a
sort
of
anxious
parade
of
mystery
fold
up
a
letter
which
she
had
apparently

to
Miss
Fairfax,
and
return
it
into
the
purple

admits
our
apology,

is
not

You
see
how
delightfully
she
writes.
Oh!
she
is
a
sweet
creature!
You
would
have
doated
on
her,
had
you
gone.
But
not
a
word
more.
Let
us
be
discreet
quite
on
our
good
behaviour.
Hush!
You
remember
those
lines
I
forget
the
poem
at
this
moment:
"For
when
a
lady's
in
the
case,
"You
know
all
other
things
give
place."
Now
I
say,
my
dear,
in
our
case,
