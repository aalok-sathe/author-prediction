of
affection
for
herself
which
was
now
in
question;
but
there
was
a
hope
(at
times
a
slight
one,
at
times
much
stronger,)
that
Harriet
might
have
deceived
herself,
and
be
overrating
his
regard
for
her.
Wish
it
she
must,
for
his
sake
be
the
consequence
nothing
to
herself,
but
his
remaining
single
all
his
life.
Could
she
be
secure
of
that,
indeed,
of
his
never
marrying
at
all,
she
believed
she
should
be
perfectly
satisfied.
Let
him
but
continue
the
same
Mr.
Knightley
to
her
and
her
father,
the
same
Mr.
Knightley
to
all
the
world;
let
Donwell
and
Hartfield
lose
none
of
their
precious
intercourse
of
friendship
and
confidence,
and
her
peace
would
be
fully
secured.
Marriage,
in
fact,
would
not
do
for
her.
It
would
be
incompatible
with
what
she
owed
to
her
father,
and
with
what
she
felt
for
him.
Nothing
should
separate
her
from
her
father.
She
would
not
marry,
even
if
she
were
asked
by
Mr.
Knightley.
It
must
be
her
ardent
wish
that
Harriet
might
be
disappointed;
and
she
hoped,
that
when
able
to
see
them
together
again,
she
might
at
least
be
able
to
ascertain
what
the
chances
for
it
were.
She
