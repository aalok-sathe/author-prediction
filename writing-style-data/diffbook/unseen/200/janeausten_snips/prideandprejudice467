there
will
probably
be
of
some
duration."
Then
after
a
short
silence
he
continued:
"Lizzy,
I
bear
you
no
ill
will
for
being
justified
in
your
advice
to
me
last
May,
which,
considering
the
event,
shows
some
greatness
of
mind."
They
were
interrupted
by
Miss
Bennet,
who
came
to
fetch
her
mother's
tea.
"This
is
a
parade,"
he
cried,
"which
does
one
good;
it
gives
such
an
elegance
to
misfortune!
Another
day
I
will
do
the
same;
I
will
sit
in
my
library,
in
my
nightcap
and
powdering
gown,
and
give
as
much
trouble
as
I
can;
or,
perhaps,
I
may
defer
it
till
Kitty
runs
away."
"I
am
not
going
to
run
away,
papa,"
said
Kitty
fretfully.
"If
I
should
ever
go
to
Brighton,
I
would
behave
better
than
Lydia."
"You
go
to
Brighton.
I
would
not
trust
you
so
near
it
as
Eastbourne
for
fifty
pounds!
No,
Kitty,
I
have
at
last
learnt
to
be
cautious,
and
you
will
feel
the
effects
of
it.
No
officer
is
ever
to
enter
into
my
house
again,
nor
even
to
pass
through
the
village.
Balls
will
be
absolutely
prohibited,
unless
you
stand
up
with
one
of
your
sisters.
And
you
