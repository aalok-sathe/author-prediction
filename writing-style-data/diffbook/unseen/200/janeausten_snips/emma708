tolerably
in
his
usual
tone,
he
said,
"I
have
never
had
a
high
opinion
of
Frank
Churchill.
I
can
suppose,
however,
that
I
may
have
underrated
him.
My
acquaintance
with
him
has
been
but
trifling.
And
even
if
I
have
not
underrated
him
hitherto,
he
may
yet
turn

With
such
a
woman
he
has
a
chance.
I

whose
happiness
will
be
involved
in
his
good
character
and
conduct,

shall
certainly
wish

"I
have
no

to
be
very
mutually
and
very
sincerely
attached."

"So
early
in
life
at
three
and
twenty
a
period
when,
if
a
man
chuses
a
wife,
he
generally
chuses
ill.
At
three
and
twenty
to
have
drawn
such
a
prize!
What
years
of
felicity
that
man,
in
all
human
calculation,
has
before
him!
Assured
of
the
love
of
such
a
woman
the
disinterested
love,
for
Jane
Fairfax's
character
vouches
for
her
disinterestedness;
every
thing
in
his
favour,
equality
of
situation
I
mean,
as

as
regards
society,
and
