a
lame
carriage
horse
threw
every
thing
into
sad
uncertainty.
It
might
be
weeks,
it
might
be
only
a
few
days,
before
the
horse
were
useable;
but
no
preparations
could
be
ventured
on,
and
it
was
all
melancholy
stagnation.
Mrs.
Elton's
resources
were
inadequate
to
such
an
attack.
"Is
not
this
most
vexatious,

she
cried.
"And
such
weather

If

did
not
begin
seriously,
he
was
obliged
to
proceed
so,
for
his
proposal
was
caught
at
with
delight;
and
the
"Oh!
I
should
like
it
of
all
things,"
was
not
plainer
in
words
than
manner.
Donwell
was
famous
for
its
strawberry
beds,
which
seemed
a
plea
for
the
invitation:
but
no
plea
was
necessary;
cabbage
beds
would
have
been
enough
to
tempt
the
lady,
who
