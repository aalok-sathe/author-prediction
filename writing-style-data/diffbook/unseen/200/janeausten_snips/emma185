an
evening
as
this,
by
any
call
of
duty
or
business,
what
a
hardship
we
should
deem
it;
and
here
are
we,
probably
with
rather
thinner
clothing
than
usual,
setting
forward
voluntarily,
without
excuse,
in
defiance
of
the
voice
of
nature,
which
tells
man,

creatures
into

rooms
and
worse

than
they
might
have
had
at
home."
Emma
did
not
find
herself
equal
to
give
the
pleased
assent,
which
no
doubt
he
was
in
the
habit
of
receiving,
to
emulate
the
"Very
true,
my
love,"
which
must
have
been
usually
administered
by
his
travelling
companion;
but
she
had
resolution
enough
to
refrain
from
making
any
answer

She
could
