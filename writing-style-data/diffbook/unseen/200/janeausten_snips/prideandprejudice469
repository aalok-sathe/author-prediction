letter."
Away
ran
the
girls,
too
eager
to
get
in
to
have
time
for
speech.
They
ran
through
the
vestibule
into
the
breakfast
room;
from
thence
to
the
library;
their
father
was
in
neither;
and
they
were
on
the
point
of
seeking
him
up
stairs
with
their
mother,
when
they
were
met
by
the
butler,
who
said:
"If
you
are
looking
for
my
master,
ma'am,
he
is
walking
towards
the
little
copse."
Upon
this
information,
they
instantly
passed
through
the
hall
once
more,
and
ran
across
the
lawn
after
their
father,
who
was
deliberately
pursuing
his
way
towards
a
small
wood
on
one
side
of
the
paddock.
Jane,
who
was
not
so
light
nor
so
much
in
the
habit
of
running
as
Elizabeth,
soon
lagged
behind,
while
her
sister,
panting
for
breath,
came
up
with
him,
and
eagerly
cried
out:
"Oh,
papa,
what
news
what
news?
Have
you
heard
from
my
uncle?"
"Yes
I
have
had
a
letter
from
him
by
express."
"Well,
and
what
news
does
it
bring
good
or
bad?"
"What
is
there
of
good
to
be
expected?"
said
he,
taking
the
letter
from
his
pocket.
"But
perhaps
you
would
like
to
read
it."
Elizabeth
impatiently
caught
it
