and
indeed
they
particularly
wish
her
to
try
her
native
air,
as
she
has
not
been
quite
so
well
as
usual
lately."
"I
am
concerned
to
hear
of
it.
I
think
they
judge
wisely.
But
Mrs.
Dixon
must
be
very
much
disappointed.
Mrs.
Dixon,
I
understand,
has
no
remarkable
degree
of
personal
beauty;
is
not,
by
any
means,
to
be
compared
with
Miss
Fairfax."
"Oh!
no.
You
are
very
obliging
to
say
such
things
but
certainly
not.
There
is
no
comparison
between
them.
Miss
Campbell
always
was
absolutely
plain
but
extremely
elegant
and
amiable."
"Yes,
that
of
course."
"Jane
caught
a
bad
cold,
poor
thing!
so
long
ago
as
the
7th
of
November,
(as
I
am
going
to
read
to
you,)
and
has
never
been
well
since.
A
long
time,
is
not
it,
for
a
cold
to
hang
upon
her?
She
never
mentioned
it
before,
because
she
would
not
alarm
us.
Just
like
her!
so
considerate!
But
however,
she
is
so
far
from
well,
that
her
kind
friends
the
Campbells
think
she
had
better
come
home,
and
try
an
air
that
always
agrees
with
her;
and
they
have
no
doubt
that
three
or
four
months
at
Highbury
will
entirely
cure
