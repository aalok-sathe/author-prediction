and
his
coming
now,
depends
upon
her
being
willing
to
spare

"Oh,
Mrs.
Churchill;
every
body
knows
Mrs.
Churchill,"
replied
Isabella:
"and
I
am
sure
I
never
think
of
that
poor
young
man
without
the
greatest
compassion.
To
be
constantly
living
with
an
ill
tempered
person,
must
be
dreadful.
It
is
what

of
which
her
own
imagination
had
already
given
her
such
instinctive
knowledge.
But
at
present
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said.
Mr.
Woodhouse
very
soon
followed
them
into
the
drawing
room.
To
be
sitting
long
after
dinner,
was
a
confinement
that
he
could
not
endure.
Neither

conversation
