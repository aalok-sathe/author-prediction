before
she
was
nine
years
old,
his
daughter's
great
fondness
for
her,
and
his
own
wish
of
being
a
real
friend,
united
to
produce
an
offer
from
Colonel
Campbell
of
undertaking
the
whole
charge
of
her
education.
It
was
accepted;
and
from
that
period
Jane
had
belonged
to
Colonel
Campbell's
family,
and
had
lived
with
them
entirely,
only
visiting
her
grandmother
from
time
to
time.
The
plan
was
that
she
should
be
brought
up
for
educating
others;
the
very
few
hundred
pounds
which
she
inherited
from
her
father
making
independence
impossible.
To
provide
for
her
otherwise
was
out
of
Colonel
Campbell's
power;
for
though
his
income,
by
pay
and
appointments,
was
handsome,
his
fortune
was
moderate
and
must
be
all
his
daughter's;
but,
by
giving
her
an
education,
he
hoped
to
be
supplying
the
means
of
respectable
subsistence
hereafter.
Such
was
Jane
Fairfax's
history.
She
had
fallen
into
good
hands,
known
nothing
but
kindness
from
the
Campbells,
and
been
given
an
excellent
education.
Living
constantly
with
right
minded
and
well
informed
people,
her
heart
and
understanding
had
received
every
advantage
of
discipline
and
culture;
and
Colonel
Campbell's
residence
being
in
London,
every
lighter
talent
had
been
done
full
justice
to,
