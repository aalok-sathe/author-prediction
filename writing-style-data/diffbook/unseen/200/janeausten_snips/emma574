and
turned
to
him
for
help.
The
word
was
blunder;
and
as
Harriet
exultingly
proclaimed
it,
there
was
a
blush
on
Jane's
cheek
which
gave
it
a
meaning
not
otherwise
ostensible.
Mr.
Knightley
connected
it
with
the
dream;
but
how
it
could
all
be,
was
beyond
his
comprehension.

his
favourite
could
have
been
so
lain
asleep!
He
feared
there
must
be
some
decided

meet
him
at

These

were

and
given
to
her
with
a
look
sly
and
demure.
He
saw
that
Emma
had

and
found
it
highly
entertaining,
though
it
was
something
which
she
judged
it
proper

censure;
for
she
said,
"Nonsense!
