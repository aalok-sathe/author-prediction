it
an
excellent
improvement?"
She
was
obliged
to
repeat
and
explain
it,
before
it
was
fully
comprehended;
and
then,
being
quite
new,
farther
representations
were
necessary
to
make
it
acceptable.
"No;
he
thought
it
very
far
from
an
improvement
a
very
bad
plan
much
worse
than
the
other.
A
room
at
an
inn
was
always
damp
and
dangerous;
never
properly
aired,
or
fit
to
be
inhabited.
If
they
must
dance,
they
had
better
dance
at
Randalls.
He
had
never
been
in
the
room
at
the
Crown
in
his
life
did
not
know
the
people
who
kept
it
by
sight.
Oh!
no
a
very
bad
plan.
They
would
catch
worse
colds
at
the
Crown
than
anywhere."
"I
was
going
to
observe,
sir,"
said
Frank
Churchill,
"that
one
of
the
great
recommendations
of
this
change
would
be
the
very
little
danger
of
any
body's
catching
cold
so
much
less
danger
at
the
Crown
than
at
Randalls!
Mr.
Perry
might
have
reason
to
regret
the
alteration,
but
nobody
else
could."
"Sir,"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse,
rather
warmly,
"you
are
very
much
mistaken
if
you
suppose
Mr.
Perry
to
be
that
sort
of
character.
Mr.
Perry
is
extremely
concerned
when
any
of
us
are
ill.
