of
both
the
Mr.
Knightleys,
that
when
once
the
event
were
over,
his
distress
would
be
soon
over
too,
she
hesitated
she
could
not
proceed.
In
this
state
of
suspense
they
were
befriended,
not
by
any
sudden
illumination
of
Mr.
Woodhouse's
mind,
or
any
wonderful
change
of
his
nervous
system,
but
by
the
operation
of
the
same
system
in
another
way.
Mrs.
Weston's
poultry
house
was
robbed
one
night
of
all
her
turkeys
evidently
by
the
ingenuity
of
man.
Other
poultry
yards
in
the
neighbourhood
also
suffered.
Pilfering
was
housebreaking
to
Mr.
Woodhouse's
fears.
He
was
very
uneasy;
and
but
for
the
sense
of
his
son
in
law's
protection,
would
have
been
under
wretched
alarm
every
night
of
his
life.
The
strength,
resolution,
and
presence
of
mind
of
the
Mr.
Knightleys,
commanded
his
fullest
dependence.
While
either
of
them
protected
him
and
his,
Hartfield
was
safe.
But
Mr.
John
Knightley
must
be
in
London
again
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
in
November.
The
result
of
this
distress
was,
that,
with
a
much
more
voluntary,
cheerful
consent
than
his
daughter
had
ever
presumed
to
hope
for
at
the
moment,
she
was
able
to
fix
her
wedding
day
and
