widow
of
a
former
vicar
of
Highbury,
was
a
very
old
lady,
almost
past
every
thing
but
tea
and
quadrille.
She
lived
with
her
single
daughter
in
a
very
small
way,
and
was
considered
with
all
the
regard
and
respect
which
a
harmless
old
lady,
under
such
untoward
circumstances,
can
excite.
Her
daughter
enjoyed
a
most
uncommon
degree
of
popularity
for
a
woman
neither
young,
handsome,
rich,
nor
married.
Miss
Bates
stood
in
the
very
worst
predicament
in
the
world
for
having
much
of
the
public
favour;
and
she
had
no
intellectual
superiority
to
make
atonement
to
herself,
or
frighten
those
who
might
hate
her
into
outward
respect.
She
had
never
boasted
either
beauty
or
cleverness.
Her
youth
had
passed
without
distinction,
and
her
middle
of
life
was
devoted
to
the
care
of
a
failing
mother,
and
the
endeavour
to
make
a
small
income
go
as
far
as
possible.
And
yet
she
was
a
happy
woman,
and
a
woman
whom
no
one
named
without
good
will.
It
was
her
own
universal
good
will
and
contented
temper
which
worked
such
wonders.
She
loved
every
body,
was
interested
in
every
body's
happiness,
quicksighted
to
every
body's
merits;
thought
herself
a
most
fortunate
