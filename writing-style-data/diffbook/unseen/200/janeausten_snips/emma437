the
words
which
clothed
it,
the
"beautiful
little
friend,"
suggested
to
her
the
idea
of
Harriet's
succeeding
her
in
his
affections.
Was
it
impossible?
No.
Harriet
undoubtedly
was
greatly
his
inferior
in
understanding;
but
he
had
been
very
much
struck
with
the
loveliness
of
her
face
and
the
warm
simplicity
of
her
manner;
and
all
the
probabilities
of
circumstance
and
connexion
were
in
her
favour.
For
Harriet,
it
would
be
advantageous
and
delightful
indeed.
"I
must
not
dwell
upon
it,"
said
she.
"I
must
not
think
of
it.
I
know
the
danger
of
indulging
such
speculations.
But
stranger
things
have
happened;
and
when
we
cease
to
care
for
each
other
as
we
do
now,
it
will
be
the
means
of
confirming
us
in
that
sort
of
true
disinterested
friendship
which
I
can
already
look
forward
to
with
pleasure."
It
was
well
to
have
a
comfort
in
store
on
Harriet's
behalf,
though
it
might
be
wise
to
let
the
fancy
touch
it
seldom;
for
evil
in
that
quarter
was
at
hand.
As
Frank
Churchill's
arrival
had
succeeded
Mr.
Elton's
engagement
in
the
conversation
of
Highbury,
as
the
latest
interest
had
entirely
borne
down
the
first,
so
now
upon
Frank
Churchill's
disappearance,
