Emma
grieved
that
she
could
not
be
more
openly
just
to
one
important
service
which
his
better
sense
would
have
rendered
her,
to
the
advice
which
would
have
saved
her
from
the
worst
of
all
her
womanly
follies
her
wilful
intimacy
with
Harriet
Smith;
but
it
was
too
tender
a
subject.
She
could
not
enter
on
it.
Harriet
was
very
seldom
mentioned
between
them.
This,
on
his
side,
might
merely
proceed
from
her
not

corresponded
more,
and
that
her
intelligence
would
not
have
rested,
as
it
now
almost
wholly
did,
on
Isabella's
letters.
He
might
observe
that
it
was
so.
The
pain
of
being
obliged
to
practise
concealment
towards
him,
was
very
little
inferior
to
the
pain
of
having
made
Harriet
unhappy.
Isabella
sent
quite
as
good
an
account
of
her
visitor
as
could
be
expected;
on
her
first
arrival
she
had
thought
her
out
of
spirits,
which
appeared
perfectly
natural,
