be
welcome;
he
could
be
sure
of
little
else.
"His
father's
marriage,"
he
said,
"had
been
the
wisest
measure,
every
friend
must
rejoice
in
it;
and
the
family
from
whom
he
had
received
such
a
blessing
must
be
ever
considered
as
having
conferred
the
highest
obligation
on
him."
He
got
as
near
as
he
could
to
thanking
her
for
Miss
Taylor's
merits,
without

Miss
Taylor

formed
Miss
Woodhouse's
character,

Miss
Woodhouse

youth
and
beauty
of
her
person.
"Elegant,
agreeable
manners,
I
was
prepared
for,"
said
he;
"but
I
confess
that,
considering
every
thing,
I
had
not
expected
more
than
a
very
tolerably
well
looking
woman
of
a
certain
age;
I
did
not
know
that
I
was
to
find
a
pretty
young
woman
in
Mrs.
Weston."
"You
cannot
see
too
much
perfection
in
Mrs.
Weston
for
my
feelings,"
said
Emma;
"were
you
to
guess
her
to
be
eighteen,
I
should
listen

pleasure;
