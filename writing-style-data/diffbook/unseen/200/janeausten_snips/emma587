"I
wish
we
had
a
donkey.
The
thing
would
be
for
us
all
to
come
on
donkeys,
Jane,
Miss
Bates,
and
me
and
my
caro
sposo
walking
by.
I
really
must
talk
to
him
about
purchasing
a
donkey.
In
a
country
life
I
conceive
it
to
be
a
sort
of
necessary;
for,
let
a
woman
have
ever
so
many
resources,
it
is
not
possible
for
her
to
be
always
shut
up
at
home;
and
very
long
walks,
you
know
in
summer
there
is
dust,
and
in
winter
there
is
dirt."
"You
will
not
find
either,
between
Donwell
and
Highbury.
Donwell
Lane
is
never
dusty,
and
now
it
is
perfectly
dry.
Come
on
a
donkey,
however,
if
you
prefer
it.
You
can
borrow
Mrs.
Cole's.
I
would
wish
every
thing
to
be
as
much
to
your
taste
as
possible."
"That
I
am
sure
you
would.
Indeed
I
do
you
justice,
my
good
friend.
Under
that
peculiar
sort
of
dry,
blunt
manner,
I
know
you
have
the
warmest
heart.
As
I
tell
Mr.
E.,
you
are
a
thorough
humourist.
Yes,
believe
me,
Knightley,
I
am
fully
sensible
of
your
attention
to
me
in
the
whole
of
this
scheme.
You
have
