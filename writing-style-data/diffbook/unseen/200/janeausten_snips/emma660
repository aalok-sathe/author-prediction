Well,
and
how
did
Mr.
Churchill
take
it?"
"Most
favourably
for
his
nephew

his
consent
with
scarcely
a
difficulty.
Conceive
what
the
events
of
a
week
have
done
in
that
family!
While
poor
Mrs.
Churchill
lived,
I

whom
he
is
just

more
necessary

ever,
that,
as
I
tell
you,
he
could
stay
with
us
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour.
He

very
much
