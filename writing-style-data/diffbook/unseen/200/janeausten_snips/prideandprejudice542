he
went
away,
an
engagement
was
formed,
chiefly
through
his
own
and
Mrs.
Bennet's
means,
for
his
coming
next
morning
to
shoot
with
her
husband.
After
this
day,
Jane
said
no
more
of
her
indifference.
Not
a
word
passed
between
the
sisters
concerning
Bingley;
but
Elizabeth
went
to
bed
in
the
happy
belief
that
all
must
speedily
be
concluded,
unless
Mr.

was
more
communicative,
and
less
eccentric,
than
the
other
had
ever
seen

Bingley
of
course
returned
with
him
to
dinner;
and
in
the
evening
Mrs.
Bennet's
invention
was
again
at
work
to
get
every
body
away
from
him
and
her
daughter.
Elizabeth,
who
had
a
letter
to
write,
went
into
the
breakfast
room
for
that
purpose
