be
more
explicit.
"On
the
very
day
of
my
coming
home
from
Longbourn,
your
uncle
had
a
most
unexpected
visitor.
Mr.
Darcy
called,
and
was
shut
up
with
him
several
hours.
It
was
all
over
before
I
arrived;
so
my
curiosity
was
not
so
dreadfully
racked
as
yours
seems
to
have
been.
He
came
to
tell
Mr.
Gardiner
that
he
had
found
out
where
your
sister
and
Mr.
Wickham
were,
and
that
he
had
seen
and
talked
with
them
both;
Wickham
repeatedly,
Lydia
once.
From
what
I
can
collect,
he
left
Derbyshire
only
one
day
after
ourselves,
and
came
to
town
with
the
resolution
of
hunting
for
them.
The
motive
professed
was
his
conviction
of
its
being
owing
to
himself
that
Wickham's
worthlessness
had
not
been
so
well
known
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
any
young
woman
of
character
to
love
or
confide
in
him.
He
generously
imputed
the
whole
to
his
mistaken
pride,
and
confessed
that
he
had
before
thought
it
beneath
him
to
lay
his
private
actions
open
to
the
world.
His
character
was
to
speak
for
itself.
He
called
it,
therefore,
his
duty
to
step
forward,
and
endeavour
to
remedy
an
evil
which
had
been
brought
