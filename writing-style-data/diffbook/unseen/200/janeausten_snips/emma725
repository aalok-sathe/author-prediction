disposition
to
hope
for
good,
which
no
inheritance
of
houses
or
lands
can
ever
equal
the
value
of.
See
me,
then,
under
these
circumstances,
arriving
on
my
first
visit
to
Randalls;
and
here
I
am
conscious
of
wrong,
for
that
visit
might
have
been
sooner
paid.
You
will
look
back
and
see
that
I
did
not
come
till
Miss
Fairfax
was
in
Highbury;
and
as
you
were
the
person
slighted,
you
will
forgive
me
instantly;
but
I
must
work
on
my
father's
compassion,
by
reminding
him,
that
so
long
as
I
absented
myself
from
his
house,
so
long
I
lost
the
blessing
of
knowing
you.
My
behaviour,
during
the
very
happy
fortnight
which
I
spent
with
you,
did
not,
I
hope,
lay
me
open
to
reprehension,
excepting
on
one
point.
And
now
I
come
to
the
principal,
the
only
important
part
of
my
conduct
while
belonging
to
you,
which
excites
my
own
anxiety,
or
requires
very
solicitous
explanation.
With
the
greatest
respect,
and
the
warmest
friendship,
do
I
mention
Miss
Woodhouse;
my
father
perhaps
will
think
I
ought
to
add,
with
the
deepest
humiliation.
A
few
words
which
dropped
from
him
yesterday
spoke
his
opinion,
and
some
censure
I
acknowledge
