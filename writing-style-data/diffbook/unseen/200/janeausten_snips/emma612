all."
"Oh!
very
well,"
exclaimed
Miss
Bates,
"then
I
need
not
be
uneasy.
'Three
things
very
dull
indeed.'
That
will
just
do
for
me,
you
know.
I
shall
be
sure
to
say
three
dull
things
as
soon
as
ever
I
open
my
mouth,
shan't
I?
(looking
round
with
the
most
good
humoured
dependence
on
every
body's
assent)
Do
not
you
all
think
I
shall?"
Emma
could
not
resist.
"Ah!
ma'am,
but
there
may
be
a
difficulty.
Pardon
me
but
you
will
be
limited
as
to
number
only
three
at
once."
Miss
Bates,
deceived
by
the
mock
ceremony
of
her
manner,
did
not
immediately
catch
her
meaning;
but,
when
it
burst
on
her,
it
could
not
anger,
though
a
slight
blush
shewed
that
it
could
pain
her.
"Ah!
well
to
be
sure.
Yes,
I
see
what
she
means,
(turning
to
Mr.
Knightley,)
and
I
will
try
to
hold
my
tongue.
I
must
make
myself
very
disagreeable,
or
she
would
not
have
said
such
a
thing
to
an
old
friend."
"I
like
your
plan,"
cried
Mr.
Weston.
"Agreed,
agreed.
I
will
do
my
best.
I
am
making
a
conundrum.
How
will
a
conundrum
reckon?"
"Low,
I
am
afraid,
sir,
very
low,"
answered
