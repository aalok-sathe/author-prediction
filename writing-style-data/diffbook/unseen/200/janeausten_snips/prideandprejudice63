a
vast
deal
pleasanter,
is
it
not,
Mr.
Bingley?"
"When
I
am
in
the
country,"
he
replied,
"I
never
wish
to
leave
it;
and
when
I
am
in
town
it
is
pretty
much
the
same.
They
have
each
their
advantages,
and
I
can
be
equally
happy
in
either."
"Aye
that
is
because
you
have
the
right
disposition.
But
that

looking

nobody
said

in

I
believe
there
are
few
neighbourhoods
larger.
I

dine
with
four
and

Nothing
but
concern
for
Elizabeth
could
enable
Bingley
to
keep

countenance.
His
sister
was

and
directed
her
eyes
towards
Mr.

with
a
very
