looked
that
way.
At
length
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said;
the
ladies
drove
on,
and
the
others
returned
into
the
house.
Mr.
Collins
no
sooner
saw
the
two
girls
than
he
began
to
congratulate
them
on
their
good
fortune,

I
rather
expected,
from
my
knowledge
of
her
affability,

it
would
happen.
But
who
could
have
foreseen
such
an
attention
as
this?
Who
could
have
imagined
that
