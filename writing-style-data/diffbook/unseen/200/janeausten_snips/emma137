I
cannot
believe
it."
"I
must
see
somebody
very
superior
to
any
one
I
have
seen
yet,
to
be
tempted;
Mr.
Elton,
you
know,
(recollecting
herself,)
is
out
of
the
question:
and
I
do
not
wish
to
see
any
such
person.
I
would
rather
not
be
tempted.
I
cannot
really
change
for
the
better.
If
I
were
to
marry,
I
must
expect
to
repent
it."
"Dear
me!
it
is
so
odd
to
hear
a
woman
talk
so!"
"I
have
none
of
the
usual
inducements
of
women
to
marry.
Were
I
to
fall
in
love,
indeed,
it
would
be
a
different
thing!
but
I
never
have
been
in
love;
it
is
not
my
way,
or
my
nature;
and
I
do
not
think
I
ever
shall.
And,
without
love,
I
am
sure
I
should
be
a
fool
to
change
such
a
situation
as
mine.
Fortune
I
do
not
want;
employment
I
do
not
want;
consequence
I
do
not
want:
I
believe
few
married
women
are
half
as
much
mistress
of
their
husband's
house
as
I
am
of
Hartfield;
and
never,
never
could
I
expect
to
be
so
truly
beloved
and
important;
so
always
first
and
always
right
in
any
man's
eyes
as
