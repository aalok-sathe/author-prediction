hope
that,
however
inferior
in
spirit
and
gaiety
might
be
the
following
and
every
future
winter
of
her
life
to
the
past,
it
would
yet
find
her
more
rational,
more
acquainted
with
herself,
and
leave
her
less
to
regret
when
it
were
gone.
The
weather
continued
much
the
same
all
the
following
morning;
and
the
same
loneliness,
and
the
same
melancholy,
seemed
to
reign
at
Hartfield
but
in
the
afternoon
it
cleared;
the
wind
changed
into
a
softer
quarter;
the
clouds
were
carried
off;
the
sun
appeared;
it
was

With
all
the
eagerness
which
such
a
transition
gives,
Emma
resolved
to
be
out
of
doors
as

as
possible.
Never
had
the
exquisite
sight,
smell,
sensation
of
nature,
tranquil,
warm,
and
brilliant
after
a
storm,
been
more
attractive
to
her.
She
longed
for
the
serenity
they
might
gradually
introduce;
and
on
Mr.
Perry's
coming
in
soon
after
dinner,
with
a
disengaged
hour
to
give
her
father,
she
lost
no
time
in
hurrying
into
the
shrubbery.
There,
with
spirits
freshened,
and
thoughts
a
little
relieved,
she
had
taken
a
few
turns,
when
she
saw
Mr.
Knightley
passing
through
the
garden
door,
and
coming
towards
her.
It
was
the
first
