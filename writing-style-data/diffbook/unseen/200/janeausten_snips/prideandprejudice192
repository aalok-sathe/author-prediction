guard
his
courtship
from
any
charm
that
could
make
a
woman
wish
for
its
continuance;
and
Miss
Lucas,
who
accepted
him
solely
from
the
pure
and
disinterested
desire
of
an
establishment,
cared
not
how
soon
that
establishment
were
gained.
Sir
William
and
Lady
Lucas
were
speedily
applied
to
for
their
consent;
and
it
was
bestowed
with
a
most
joyful
alacrity.
Mr.
Collins's
present
circumstances
made
it
a
most
eligible
match
for
their
daughter,
to
whom
they
could
give
little
fortune;
and
his
prospects
of
future
wealth
were
exceedingly
fair.
Lady
Lucas
began
directly
to
calculate,
with
more
interest
than
the
matter
had
ever
excited
before,
how
many
years
longer
Mr.
Bennet
was
likely
to
live;
and
Sir
William
gave
it
as
his
decided
opinion,
that
whenever
Mr.
Collins
should
be
in
possession
of
the
Longbourn
estate,
it
would
be
highly
expedient
that
both
he
and
his
wife
should
make
their
appearance
at
St.
James's.
The
whole
family,
in
short,
were
properly
overjoyed
on
the
occasion.
The
younger
girls
formed
hopes
of
coming
out
a
year
or
two
sooner
than
they
might
otherwise
have
done;
and
the
boys
were
relieved
from
their
apprehension
of
Charlotte's
dying
an
old
maid.
