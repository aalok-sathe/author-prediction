I
am
perfectly
comfortable
to
day."
"You
are
comfortable
because
you
are
under
command."
"Your
command?
Yes."
"Perhaps
I
intended
you
to
say
so,
but
I
meant
self
command.
You
had,
somehow
or
other,
broken
bounds
yesterday,
and
run
away
from
your
own
management;
but
to

That
is
your
date.
I
thought
I
had
seen
you
first
in
February."
"Your
gallantry
is
really
unanswerable.
But
(lowering
her
voice)
nobody
speaks
except
ourselves,
and
it
is
rather
too
much
to
be
talking
nonsense
for
the
entertainment
of
seven
silent
people."
"I
say
nothing
of
which
I
am
ashamed,"
replied
he,
with
lively
impudence.
"I
saw
you
