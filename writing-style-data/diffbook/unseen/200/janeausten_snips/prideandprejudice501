Elizabeth
had
the
satisfaction
of
receiving
an
answer
to
her
letter
as
soon
as
she
possibly
could.
She
was
no
sooner
in
possession
of
it
than,
hurrying
into
the
little
copse,
where
she
was
least
likely
to
be
interrupted,
she
sat
down
on
one
of
the
benches
and
prepared
to
be
happy;
for
the
length
of
the
letter
convinced
her
that
it
did
not
contain
a
denial.

"MY

NIECE,

you
know
that
I
had
not
imagined
such
inquiries
to
be
necessary
on
your
side.
If
you
do
not
choose
to
understand
me,
forgive
my
impertinence.
Your
uncle
is
as
much
surprised
as
I
am
and
nothing
but
the
belief
of
your
being
a
party
concerned
would
have
allowed
him
to
act
as
he
has
done.
But
if
you
are
really
innocent
and
ignorant,
I
must
