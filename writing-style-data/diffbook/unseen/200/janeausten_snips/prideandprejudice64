had
been
at
Longbourn
since
her
coming
away.
"Yes,
she
called
yesterday
with
her
father.
What
an
agreeable
man
Sir
William
is,
Mr.
Bingley,
is
not
he?
So
much
the
man
of
fashion!
So
genteel
and
easy!
He
has
always
something
to
say
to

"She
seems
a
very
pleasant
young
woman."
"Oh!
dear,
yes;
but
you
must
own
