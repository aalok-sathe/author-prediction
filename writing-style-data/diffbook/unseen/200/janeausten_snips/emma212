Mr.
Weston's
good
wine,
and
felt
sure
that
he
would
want
to
be
talking
nonsense.
To
restrain
him
as
much
as
might
be,
by
her
own
manners,
she
was
immediately
preparing
to
speak
with
exquisite
calmness
and
gravity
of
the
weather
and
the
night;
but
scarcely
had
she
begun,
scarcely
had
they
passed
the
sweep
gate
and
joined
the
other
carriage,

diffidence,
Mr.

the
lover
of
Harriet,
was
professing
himself

lover.
She
tried
to
stop

he
would
