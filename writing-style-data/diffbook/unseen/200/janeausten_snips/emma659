discovery
of
what
she
was
doing,
of
this
very
project
of
hers,
which
determined
him
to
come
forward
at
once,
own
it
all
to
his
uncle,
throw
himself
on
his
kindness,
and,
in
short,
put
an
end
to
the
miserable
state
of
concealment
that
had
been
carrying
on
so
long."
Emma
began
to
listen
better.
"I
am
to
hear
from
him
soon,"
continued
Mrs.
Weston.
"He

at
parting,
that
he
should
soon
write;

to
be

be
severe,
don't
let
us
be
in
a
hurry
to
condemn
him.
Let
us
have
patience.
I
must
love
him;
and
now
that
I
am
satisfied
on
one
point,
the
one
material
point,
I
am
sincerely
anxious
for
its
all
turning
out
well,
and
ready
to
hope
that
it
may.
They
must
both
have
suffered
a
great
deal
under
such
a
system
of
secresy
and
concealment."
"His
sufferings,"
replied
Emma
dryly,
"do
not
appear
to
