And
as
for
objects
of
interest,
objects
for
the
affections,
which
is
in
truth
the
great
point
of
inferiority,
the
want
of
which
is
really
the
great
evil
to
be
avoided
in
not
marrying,
I
shall
be
very
well
off,
with
all
the
children
of
a
sister
I
love
so
much,
to
care
about.
There
will
be
enough

times
but
are

"Oh!
yes;
we
are
always
forced
to
be
acquainted
whenever
she
comes
to
Highbury.
By
the
bye,
that
is
almost
enough
to
put
one
out
of
conceit
with
a
niece.
Heaven

at

that
I
should
ever
bore
people
half

does
about
