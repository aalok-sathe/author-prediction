to
lay
down
rules
for
it:
you
must
let
it
go
its
own
way.
I
have
no
doubt
of
his
having,
at
times,
considerable
influence;
but
it
may
be
perfectly
impossible
for
him
to
know
beforehand
when
it
will
be."
Emma
listened,
and
then
coolly
said,
"I
shall
not
be

"He
may
have
a

the
other

appeared.
Mr.
Weston
was
chatty
and
convivial,
and
no
friend
to
early
separations
of
any

but
at
last
the
drawing
room
party
did
receive

augmentation.
Mr.
Elton,
in
very
