no
weather
could
keep
entirely
from
them,
"Ah!
Mr.
Knightley,
why
do
not
you
stay
at
home
like
poor
Mr.
Elton?"
These
days
of
confinement
would
have
been,
but
for
her
private
perplexities,
remarkably
comfortable,
as
such
seclusion
exactly
suited
her
brother,
whose
feelings
must
always
be
of
great
importance
to
his
companions;
and
he
had,
besides,
so
thoroughly
cleared
off

and

were
not
detained
long
at
Hartfield.
The
weather
soon
improved

for
those
to
move
who
must
move;
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
having,
as
usual,
tried
to
persuade
his
daughter
to
stay
behind
with
all
her
children,
was
obliged
to
see
the
whole
party
set
off,
and
return
to
his
lamentations
over
the
destiny
of
poor
Isabella;
which

Isabella,
