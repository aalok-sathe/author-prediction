Sucklings
and
little
Bragges,
there
are
not
such
elegant
sweet
children
anywhere.
Jane
will
be
treated
with
such
regard
and
kindness!
It
will
be
nothing
but
pleasure,
a
life
of
pleasure.
And
her
salary!
I
really
cannot
venture
to
name
her
salary
to
you,
Miss
Woodhouse.

Mrs.
Smallridge

poor
mother
does
not
know
how

So

I
try
to
put
