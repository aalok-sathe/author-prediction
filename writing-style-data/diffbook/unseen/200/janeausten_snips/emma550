to
have
borrowed
a
pair
of
scissors
the
night
before
of
Miss
Bates,
and
to
have
forgotten
to
restore
them,
he
had
been
obliged
to
stop
at
her
door,
and
go
in
for
a
few
minutes:
he
was
therefore
later
than
he
had
intended;
and
being
on
foot,
was
unseen
by
the
whole
party
till
almost
close
to
them.
The
terror
which
the
woman
and
boy
had
been
creating
in
Harriet
was
then
their
own
portion.
He
had
left
them
completely
frightened;
and
Harriet
eagerly
clinging
to
him,
and
hardly
able
to
speak,
had
just
strength
enough
to
reach
Hartfield,
before
her
spirits
were
quite
overcome.
It
was
his
idea
to
bring
her
to
Hartfield:
he
had
thought
of
no
other
place.
This
was
the
amount
of
the
whole
story,
of
his
communication
and
of
Harriet's
as
soon
as
she
had
recovered
her
senses
and
speech.
He
dared
not
stay
longer
than
to
see
her
well;
these
several
delays
left
him
not
another
minute
to
lose;
and
Emma
engaging
to
give
assurance
of
her
safety
to
Mrs.
Goddard,
and
notice
of
there
being
such
a
set
of
people
in
the
neighbourhood
to
Mr.
Knightley,
he
set
off,
with
all
the
