had
been
accustomed
to
of
course
he
was
not
wholly
without
apprehension.
When
he
was
speaking
of
it
in
that
way,
I
honestly
said
that
the
world
I
could
give
up
parties,
balls,
plays
for
I
had
no
fear
of
retirement.
Blessed
with
so
many
resources
within
myself,
the
world
was
not
necessary
to
me.
I
could
do
very
well
without
it.
To
those
who
had
no
resources
it
was
a
different
thing;
but
my
resources
made
me
quite
independent.
And
as
to
smaller
sized
rooms
than
I
had
been
used

I
really
could
not
give
it
a

I
hoped
I
was
perfectly
equal
to
any
sacrifice
of
that
description.
Certainly
I
had
been
accustomed
to
every
luxury
at
Maple
Grove;
but
I
did
assure
him
that
two
carriages
were
not
necessary
to
my
happiness,
nor
were
spacious
apartments.
'But,'
said
I,
'to
be
quite
honest,
I
do
not
think
I
can
live
without
something
of
a
musical
society.
I
condition
for
nothing
else;
but
without
music,
life
would
be
a
blank
to
me.'"
"We
cannot
suppose,"
said
Emma,
smiling,
"that
Mr.
Elton
would
hesitate
to
assure
you
of
there
being
a
very
musical
society
in
Highbury;
