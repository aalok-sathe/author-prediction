sale
of
Randalls
was
long
looked
forward
to;
but
he
had
gone
steadily
on,
with
these
objects
in
view,
till
they
were
accomplished.
He
had
made
his
fortune,
bought
his
house,
and
obtained
his
wife;
and
was
beginning
a
new
period
of
existence,
with
every
probability
of
greater
happiness
than
in
any
yet
passed
through.
He
had
never
been
an
unhappy
man;
his
own
temper
had
secured
him
from
that,
even
in
his
first
marriage;
but
his
second
must
shew
him
how
delightful
a
well
judging
and
truly
amiable
woman
could
be,
and
must
give
him
the
pleasantest
proof
of
its
being
a
great
deal
better
to
choose
than
to
be
chosen,
to
excite
gratitude
than
to
feel
it.
He
had
only
himself
to
please
in
his
choice:
his
fortune
was
his
own;
for
as
to
Frank,
it
was
more
than
being
tacitly
brought
up
as
his
uncle's
heir,
it
had
become
so
avowed
an
adoption
as
to
have
him
assume
the
name
of
Churchill
on
coming
of
age.
It
was
most
unlikely,
therefore,
that
he
should
ever
want
his
father's
assistance.
His
father
had
no
apprehension
of
it.
The
aunt
was
a
capricious
woman,
and
governed
her
husband
entirely;
