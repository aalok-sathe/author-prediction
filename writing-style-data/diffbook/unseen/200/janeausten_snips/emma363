with
time
persuade
her
to
any
thing.
One
of
those
points
on
which
his
influence
failed,
he
then
mentioned.
He
had
wanted
very
much
to
go
abroad
had
been
very
eager
indeed
to
be
allowed
to
travel
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it.
This
had
happened
the
year
before.
Now,
he
said,
he
was
beginning
to
have
no
longer
the
same
wish.
The
unpersuadable
point,
which
he
did
not
mention,
Emma
guessed
to
be
good
behaviour
to
his

you
may
now
begin
to
regret
that
you
spent
one
whole
day,
out
of
so
few,
in
having
your
hair
cut."
"No,"
said
he,
smiling,
"that
is
no
subject
of
regret
at
all.
I
have
no
pleasure
in
seeing
my
friends,
unless
I
can
believe
myself
