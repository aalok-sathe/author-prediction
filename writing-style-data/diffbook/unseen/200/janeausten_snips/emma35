not
hurt
you.
Miss
Bates,
let
Emma
help
you
to
a
little
bit
of
tart
a
very
little
bit.
Ours
are
all
apple
tarts.
You
need
not
be
afraid
of
unwholesome
preserves
here.
I
do
not
advise
the
custard.
Mrs.
Goddard,
what
say
you
to
half
a
glass
of
wine?
A
small
half
glass,
put
into
a
tumbler
of
water?
I
do
not
think
it
could
disagree
with
you."
Emma
allowed
her
father
to
talk
but
supplied
her
visitors
in
a
much
more
satisfactory
style,
and
on
the
present
evening
had
particular
pleasure
in
sending
them
away
happy.
The
happiness
of
Miss
Smith
was
quite
equal
to
her
intentions.
Miss
Woodhouse
was
so
great
a
personage
in
Highbury,
that
the
prospect
of
the
introduction
had
given
as
much
panic
as
pleasure;
but
the
humble,
grateful
little
girl
went
off
with
highly
gratified
feelings,
delighted
with
the
affability
with
which
Miss
Woodhouse
had
treated
her
all
the
evening,
and
actually
shaken
hands
with
her
at
last!
Harriet
Smith's
intimacy
at
Hartfield
was
soon
a
settled
thing.
Quick
and
decided
in
her
ways,
Emma
lost
no
time
in
inviting,
encouraging,
and
telling
her
to
come
very
often;
and
as
their
acquaintance
increased,
