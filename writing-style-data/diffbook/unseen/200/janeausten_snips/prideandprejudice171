tormenting
a
respectable
man.
I
would
rather
be
paid
the
compliment
of
being
believed
sincere.
I
thank
you
again
and
again
for
the
honour
you
have
done
me
in
your
proposals,
but
to
accept
them
is
absolutely
impossible.
My
feelings
in
every
respect
forbid
it.
Can
I
speak
plainer?
Do
not
consider
me
now
as
an
elegant
female,
intending
to
plague
you,
but
as
a
rational
creature,
speaking
the
truth
from
her
heart."
"You
are
uniformly
charming!"
cried
he,
with
an
air
of
awkward
gallantry;
"and
I
am
persuaded
that
when
sanctioned
by
the
express
authority
of
both
your
excellent
parents,
my
proposals
will
not
fail
of
being
acceptable."
To
such
perseverance
in
wilful
self
deception
Elizabeth
would
make
no
reply,
and
immediately
and
in
silence
withdrew;
determined,
if
he
persisted
in
considering
her
repeated
refusals
as
flattering
encouragement,
to
apply
to
her
father,
whose
negative
might
be
uttered
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
decisive,
and
whose
behaviour
at
least
could
not
be
mistaken
for
the
affectation
and
coquetry
of
an
elegant
female.
Mr.
Collins
was
not
left
long
to
the
silent
contemplation
of
his
successful
love;
for
Mrs.
Bennet,
having
dawdled
about
in
the
vestibule
to
