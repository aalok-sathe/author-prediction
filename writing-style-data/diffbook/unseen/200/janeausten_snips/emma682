under!
The
blunders,
the
blindness
of
her
own
head
and
heart!
she
sat
still,
she
walked
about,
she
tried
her
own
room,
she
tried
the
shrubbery
in
every
place,
every
posture,
she
perceived
that
she
had
acted
most
weakly;
that
she
had
been
imposed
on
by
others
in
a
most
mortifying
degree;
that
she
had
been
imposing
on
herself
in
a
degree
yet
more
mortifying;
that
she
was
wretched,
and
should
probably
find
this
day
but
the
beginning
of
wretchedness.
To
understand,
thoroughly
understand
her
own
heart,
was
the
first
endeavour.
To
that
point
went
every
leisure
moment
which
her
father's
claims
on
her
allowed,
and
every
moment
of
involuntary
absence
of
mind.
How
long
had
Mr.
Knightley
been
so
dear
to
her,
as
every
feeling
declared
him
now
to
be?
When
had
his
influence,
such
influence
begun?
When
had
he
succeeded
to
that
place
in
her
affection,
which
Frank
Churchill
had
once,
for
a
short
period,
occupied?
She
looked
back;
she
compared
the
two
compared
them,
as
they
had
always
stood
in
her
estimation,
from
the
time
of
the
latter's
becoming
known
to
her
and
as
they
must
at
any
time
have
been
compared
by
her,
had
it
oh!
