for
the
happiness
of
both
that
she
should
employ
the
power,
which
her
fancy
told
her
she
still
possessed,
of
bringing
on
her
the
renewal
of
his
addresses.
It
had
been
settled
in
the
evening
between
the
aunt
and
the
niece,
that
such
a
striking
civility
as
Miss
Darcy's

coming
to
see
them

day
of
her
arrival
at
Pemberley,
for
she
had
reached

left
them
soon
after
breakfast.
The
fishing
scheme
had
been
renewed
the
day
before,
and
a
positive
engagement
made
of
his
meeting
some
of
the
gentlemen
at
Pemberley
before
noon.
Convinced
as
Elizabeth
now
was
that
Miss
Bingley's
dislike
of
her
had
originated
in
jealousy,
she
could
not
help
feeling
how
unwelcome
her
appearance
at
Pemberley
must
be
to
her,
and
was
curious
to
know
with
