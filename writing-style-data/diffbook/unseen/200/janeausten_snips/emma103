may
not
find
offers
of
marriage
flow
in
so
fast,
though
she
is
a
very
pretty
girl.
Men
of
sense,
whatever
you
may
chuse
to
say,
do
not
want
silly
wives.
Men
of
family
would
not
be
very
fond
of
connecting
themselves
with
a
girl
of
such
obscurity
and
most
prudent
men
would
be
afraid
of
the
inconvenience
and
disgrace
they
might
be
involved
in,
when
the
mystery
of
her
parentage
came
to
be
revealed.
Let
her
marry
Robert
Martin,
and
she
is
safe,
respectable,
and
happy
for
ever;
but
if
you
encourage
her
to
expect
to
marry
greatly,
and
teach
her
to
be
satisfied
with
nothing
less
than
a
man
of
consequence
and
large
fortune,
she
may
be
a
parlour
boarder
at
Mrs.
Goddard's
all
the
rest
of
her
life
or,
at
least,
(for
Harriet
Smith
is
a
girl
who
will
marry
somebody
or
other,)
till
she
grow
desperate,
and
is
glad
to
catch
at
the
old
writing
master's
son."
"We
think
so
very
differently
on
this
point,
Mr.
Knightley,
that
there
can
be
no
use
in
canvassing
it.
We
shall
only
be
making
each
other
more
angry.
But
as
to
my
letting
her
marry
Robert
Martin,
it
is
