little
Miss
de
Bourgh
ate,
pressing
her
to
try
some
other
dish,
and
fearing
she
was
indisposed.
Maria
thought
speaking
out
of
the
question,
and
the
gentlemen
did
nothing
but
eat
and
admire.
When
the
ladies
returned
to
the
drawing
room,
there
was
little
to
be
done
but
to
hear
Lady
Catherine
talk,
which
she
did
without
any
intermission
till
coffee
came
in,
delivering
her
opinion
on
every
subject
in
so
decisive
a
manner,
as
proved
that
she
was
not
used
to
have
her
judgement
controverted.
She
inquired
into
Charlotte's
domestic
concerns
familiarly
and
minutely,
gave
her
a
great
deal
of
advice
as
to
the
management
of
them
all;
told
her
how
everything
ought
to
be
regulated
in
so
small
a
family
as
hers,
and
instructed
her
as
to
the
care
of
her
cows
and
her
poultry.
Elizabeth
found
that
nothing
was
beneath
this
great
lady's
attention,
which
could
furnish
her
with
an
occasion
of
dictating
to
others.
In
the
intervals
of
her
discourse
with
Mrs.
Collins,
she
addressed
a
variety
of
questions
to
Maria
and
Elizabeth,
but
especially
to
the
latter,
of
whose
connections
she
knew
the
least,
and
who
she
observed
to
Mrs.
Collins
was
a
very
genteel,
