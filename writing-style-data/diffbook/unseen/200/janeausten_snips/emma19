unreasonable
regrets
at
that
brother's
unreasonable
anger,
nor
from
missing
the
luxuries
of
her
former
home.
They
lived
beyond
their
income,
but
still
it
was
nothing
in
comparison
of
Enscombe:
she
did
not
cease
to
love
her
husband,
but
she
wanted
at
once
to
be
the
wife
of
Captain
Weston,
and
Miss
Churchill
of
Enscombe.
Captain
Weston,
who
had
been
considered,
especially
by
the
Churchills,
as
making
such
an
amazing
match,
was
proved
to
have
much
the
worst
of
the
bargain;
for
when
his
wife
died,
after
a
three
years'
marriage,
he
was
rather
a
poorer
man
than
at
first,
and
with
a
child
to
maintain.
From
the
expense
of
the
child,
however,
he
was
soon
relieved.
The
boy
had,
with
the
additional
softening
claim
of
a
lingering
illness
of
his
mother's,
been
the
means
of
a
sort
of
reconciliation;
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Churchill,
having
no
children
of
their
own,
nor
any
other
young
creature
of
equal
kindred
to
care
for,
offered
to
take
the
whole
charge
of
the
little
Frank
soon
after
her
decease.
Some
scruples
and
some
reluctance
the
widower
father
may
be
supposed
to
have
felt;
but
as
they
were
overcome
by
other
considerations,
the
