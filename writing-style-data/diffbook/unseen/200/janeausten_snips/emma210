subject
as
his
nervous
constitution
allowed;
but
the
alarm
that
had
been
raised
could
not
be
appeased
so
as
to
admit
of
any
comfort
for
him
while
he
continued
at
Randalls.
He
was
satisfied
of
there
being
no
present
danger
in
returning
home,
but
no
assurances
could
convince
him
that
it
was
safe
to
stay;
and
while
the
others
were
variously
urging
and
recommending,
Mr.
Knightley
and
Emma
settled
it
in
a
few
brief
sentences:
thus
"Your
father
will
not
be
easy;
why
do
not
you
go?"
"I
am
ready,
if
the
others
are."
"Shall
I
ring
the
bell?"
"Yes,
do."
And
the
bell
was
rung,
and
the
carriages
spoken
for.
A
few
minutes
more,
and
Emma
hoped
to
see
one
troublesome
companion
deposited
in
his
own
house,
to
get
sober
and
cool,
and
the
other
recover
his
temper
and
happiness
when
this
visit
of
hardship
were
over.
The
carriage
came:
and
Mr.
Woodhouse,
always
the
first
object
on
such
occasions,
was
carefully
attended
to
his
own
by
Mr.
Knightley
and
Mr.
Weston;
but
not
all
that
either
could
say
could
prevent
some
renewal
of
alarm
at
the
sight
of
the
snow
which
had
actually
fallen,
and
the
discovery
of
