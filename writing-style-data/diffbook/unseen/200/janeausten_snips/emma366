how
readily
he
came
into
my
wishes;
and
having
his
approbation,
I
made
my
way
directly
to
Miss
Bates,
to
assure
her
that
the
carriage
would
be
at
her
service
before
it
took
us
home;
for
I
thought
it
would
be
making
her
comfortable
at
once.
Good
soul!
she
was
as
grateful
as
possible,
you
may
be
sure.
'Nobody
was
ever
so
fortunate
as
herself!'
but
with
many,
many
thanks
'there
was
no
occasion
to
trouble
us,
for
Mr.
Knightley's
carriage
had
brought,
and
was
to
take
them
home
again.'
I
was
quite
surprized;
very
glad,
I
am

Such
a
very
kind
attention
and
so
thoughtful
an
attention!
the
sort
of
thing
that
so
few
men
would
think
of.
And,
in
short,
from
knowing
his
usual
ways,
I
am
very
much
inclined
to
think
that
it
was
for
their
accommodation
the
carriage
was
used
at
all.
I
do
suspect
he
would
not
have
had
a
pair
of
horses
for
himself,
and
that
it
was
only
as
an
excuse
for
assisting
them."
"Very
likely,"
said
Emma
"nothing
more
likely.
I
know
no
man
more
likely
than
Mr.
Knightley
to
do
the
sort
of
thing
to
