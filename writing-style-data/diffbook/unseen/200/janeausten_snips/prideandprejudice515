been
such
a
thing
for
me!
The
quiet,
the
retirement
of
such
a
life
would
have
answered
all
my
ideas
of
happiness!
But
it
was
not
to
be.
Did
you
ever
hear
Darcy
mention
the
circumstance,
when
you
were
in
Kent?"
"I
have
heard
from
authority,
which
I
thought
as
good,
that
it
was

when
first
we
talked
of

the
door
of
the
house,
for
she
had
walked
fast

him;
and
unwilling,
for
her
sister's

to
provoke
him,
she
