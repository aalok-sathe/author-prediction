figure
particularly
graceful;
her
size
a
most
becoming
medium,
between
fat
and
thin,
though
a
slight
appearance
of
ill
health
seemed
to
point
out
the
likeliest
evil
of
the
two.
Emma
could
not
but
feel
all
this;
and
then,
her
face
her
features
there
was
more
beauty
in
them
altogether
than
she
had
remembered;
it
was
not
regular,
but
it
was
very
pleasing
beauty.
Her

which,
whether
of
person
or
of
mind,
she
saw
so
little
in
Highbury.
There,
not
to
be
vulgar,
was
distinction,
and
merit.
In
short,
she
sat,
during
the
first
visit,
looking
at
Jane
Fairfax
with
twofold
complacency;
the
sense
of
pleasure
and
the
sense
of
rendering
justice,
and
was
determining
that
she
would
dislike
her
no
longer.
When
she
took

her
history,

her
situation,
