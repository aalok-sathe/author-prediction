over.
She
could
now
look
forward
to
giving
him
that
full
and
perfect
confidence
which
her
disposition
was
most
ready
to
welcome
as
a
duty.
In
the
gayest
and
happiest
spirits
she
set
forward
with
her
father;
not
always
listening,
but
always
agreeing
to
what
he
said;
and,
whether
in
speech
or
silence,
conniving
at
the
comfortable
persuasion
of
his
being
obliged
to
go
to
Randalls
every
day,
or
poor
Mrs.
Weston
would
be
disappointed.
They
arrived.
Mrs.
Weston
was
alone
in
the
drawing
room:
but
hardly
had
they

of
the
baby,
and
Mr.
Woodhouse

the
thanks
for
coming,
which
he
asked
for,
when
a
glimpse
was
caught
through
the
blind,

two
figures
passing
near
the
window.
"It
is
Frank
and
Miss
Fairfax,"
said
Mrs.
Weston.
"I
was
just
going
to
tell
you
of
our
agreeable
surprize
in
seeing
him
arrive
this
morning.
He
stays
till
to
morrow,
and
Miss
Fairfax
has
been
persuaded
to
spend
the
day
with
us.
They
are
coming
in,
I
hope."
In
half
a
minute
they
were
in
the
room.
Emma
was
extremely
glad
to
see
him
but
there
was
a
degree
of
confusion
a
number
of
embarrassing
recollections
on
each
