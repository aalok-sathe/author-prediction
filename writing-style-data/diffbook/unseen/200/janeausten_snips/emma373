the
honour
of
trying
it.
Frank
Churchill,
of
whom,
in
the
eagerness
of
her
conversation
with
Mrs.
Weston,
she
had
been
seeing
nothing,
except
that
he
had
found
a
seat
by
Miss
Fairfax,
followed
Mr.
Cole,
to
add
his
very
pressing
entreaties;
and
as,
in
every
respect,
it
suited
Emma
best
to
lead,
she
gave
a
very
proper
compliance.
She
knew
the
limitations
of
her
own
powers
too
well
to
attempt
more
than
she
could
perform
with
credit;
she
wanted
neither
taste
nor
spirit
in
the
little
things
which
are
generally
acceptable,
and
could
accompany
her
own
voice
well.
One
accompaniment
to
her
song
took
her
agreeably
by
surprize
a
second,
slightly
but
correctly
taken
by
Frank
Churchill.
Her
pardon
was
duly
begged
at
the
close
of
the
song,
and
every
thing
usual
followed.
He
was
accused
of
having
a
delightful
voice,
and
a
perfect
knowledge
of
music;
which
was
properly
denied;
and
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
matter,
and
had
no
voice
at
all,
roundly
asserted.
They
sang
together
once
more;
and
Emma
would
then
resign
her
place
to
Miss
Fairfax,
whose
performance,
both
vocal
and
instrumental,
she
never
could
attempt
to
conceal
from
herself,
was
infinitely
superior
