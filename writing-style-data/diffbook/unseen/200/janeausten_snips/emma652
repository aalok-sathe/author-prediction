the
late
event
at
Richmond
had
brought
forward.
Her
fancy
was
very
active.
Half
a
dozen
natural
children,
perhaps
and
poor
Frank
cut
off!
This,
though
very
undesirable,
would
be
no
matter
of
agony
to
her.
It
inspired
little
more
than
an
animating
curiosity.
"Who
is
that
gentleman
on
horseback?"
said
she,
as
they
proceeded
speaking
more
to
assist
Mr.
Weston
in
keeping
his
secret,
than
with
any
other
view.
"I
do
not
know.
One
of
the
Otways.
Not
Frank;
it
is
not
Frank,
I
assure
you.
You
will
not
see
him.
He
is
half
way
to
Windsor
by
this
time."
"Has
your
son
been
with
you,
then?"
"Oh!
yes
did
not
you
know?
Well,
well,
never
mind."
For
a
moment
he
was
silent;
and
then
added,
in
a
tone
much
more
guarded
and
demure,
"Yes,
Frank
came
over
this
morning,
just
to
ask
us
how
we
did."
They
hurried
on,
and
were
speedily
at
Randalls.
"Well,
my
dear,"
said
he,
as
they
entered
the
room
"I
have
brought
her,
and
now
I
hope
you
will
soon
be
better.
I
shall
leave
you
together.
There
is
no
use
in
delay.
I
shall
not
be
far
off,
if
you
want
me."
