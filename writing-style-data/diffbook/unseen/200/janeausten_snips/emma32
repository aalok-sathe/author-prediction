of
great
sweetness,
and,
before
the
end
of
the
evening,
Emma
was
as
much
pleased
with
her
manners
as
her
person,
and
quite
determined
to
continue
the
acquaintance.
She
was
not
struck
by
any
thing
remarkably
clever
in
Miss
Smith's
conversation,
but
she
found
her
altogether
very
engaging
not
inconveniently
shy,
not
unwilling
to
talk
and
yet
so
far
from
pushing,
shewing
so
proper
and
becoming
a
deference,
seeming
so
pleasantly
grateful
for
being
admitted
to
Hartfield,
and
so
artlessly
impressed
by
the
appearance
of
every
thing
in
so
superior
a
style
to
what
she
had
been
used
to,
that
she
must
have
good
sense,
and
deserve
encouragement.
Encouragement
should
be
given.
Those
soft
blue
eyes,
and
all
those
natural
graces,
should
not
be
wasted
on
the
inferior
society
of
Highbury
and
its
connexions.
The
acquaintance
she
had
already
formed
were
unworthy
of
her.
The
friends
from
whom
she
had
just
parted,
though
very
good
sort
of
people,
must
be
doing
her
harm.
They
were
a
family
of
the
name
of
Martin,
whom
Emma
well
knew
by
character,
as
renting
a
large
farm
of
Mr.
Knightley,
and
residing
in
the
parish
of
Donwell
very
creditably,
she
believed
she
knew
Mr.
