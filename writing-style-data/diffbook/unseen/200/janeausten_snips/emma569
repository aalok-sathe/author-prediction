course
it
must
have
been
a
dream.
I
am
a
great
dreamer.
I
dream
of
every
body
at
Highbury
when
I
am
away
and
when
I
have
gone
through
my
particular
friends,
then
I
begin
dreaming
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Perry."

though,"
observed
his

a
heap
of
absurdities
it
is!

shews
that
Highbury
is
in
your
thoughts
when
you
are
absent.
Emma,
you
are
a
great
dreamer,
I
think?"
Emma
was
out
of
hearing.
She
had
hurried
on
before
her
guests
to
prepare
her
father
for
their
appearance,
and
was
beyond
the
reach

Mr.
Weston's
hint.
"Why,

truth,"
cried
Miss
Bates,
