what
he
was
talking
about,
and
that
he
shewed
a
very
amiable
inclination
to
settle
early
in
life,
and
to
marry,
from
worthy
motives.
He
might
not
be
aware
of
the
inroads
on
domestic
peace
to
be
occasioned
by
no
housekeeper's
room,
or
a
bad
butler's
pantry,
but
no
doubt
he
did
perfectly
feel
that
Enscombe
could
not
make
him
happy,
and
that
whenever
he
were
attached,
he
would
willingly
give
up
much
of
wealth
to
be
allowed
an
early
establishment.
Emma's
very
good
opinion
of
Frank
Churchill
was
a
little
shaken
the
following
day,
by
hearing
that
he
was
gone
off
to
London,
merely
to
have
his
hair
cut.
A
sudden
freak
seemed
to
have
seized
him
at
breakfast,
and
he
had
sent
for
a
chaise
and
set
off,
intending
to
return
to
dinner,
but
with
no
more
important
view
that
appeared
than
having
his
hair
cut.
There
was
certainly
no
harm
in
his
travelling
sixteen
miles
twice
over
on
such
an
errand;
but
there
was
an
air
of
foppery
and
nonsense
in
it
which
she
could
not
approve.
It
did
not
accord
with
the
rationality
of
plan,
the
moderation
in
expense,
or
even
the
unselfish
warmth
of
heart,
