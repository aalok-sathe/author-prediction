on
his
own
judgment
in
so
anxious
a
case,
but
his
reliance
on
mine
made
every
thing
easy.
I
was
obliged
to
confess
one
thing,
which
for
a
time,
and
not
unjustly,
offended
him.
I
could
not
allow
myself
to
conceal
that
your
sister
had
been
in
town
three
months
last
winter,
that
I
had
known
it,
and
purposely
kept

it
was
rather
too
early
to
begin.
In
anticipating
the
happiness
of
Bingley,
which
of
course
was
to
be
inferior
only
to
his
own,
he
continued
the
conversation
till
they
reached
the
house.
In
the
hall
they
parted.
"My
dear
Lizzy,
where
can
you
have
been
walking
to?"
was
a
question
which
Elizabeth
received
from
Jane
as
soon
as
she
entered
their
room,
and
from
all
the
others
when
they
