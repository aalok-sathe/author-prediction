when
she
got
to
Maple
Grove,
he
could
recollect
that
there
were
ladies
just
arriving
to
be
attended
to,
and
with
happy
smiles
must
hurry
away.
Mrs.
Elton
turned
to
Mrs.
Weston.
"I
have
no
doubt
of
its
being
our
carriage
with
Miss
Bates
and
Jane.
Our
coachman
and
horses
are
so
extremely
expeditious!
I
believe
we
drive
faster
than
any
body.
What
a
pleasure
it
is
to
send
one's
carriage
for
a
friend!
I
understand
you
were
so
kind
as
to
offer,
but
another
time
it
will
be
quite
unnecessary.
You
may
be
very
sure
I
shall
always
take
care
of
them."
Miss
Bates
and
Miss
Fairfax,
escorted
by
the
two
gentlemen,
walked
into
the
room;
and
Mrs.
Elton
seemed
to
think
it
as
much
her
duty
as
Mrs.
Weston's
to
receive
them.
Her
gestures
and
movements
might
be
understood
by
any
one
who
looked
on
like
Emma;
but
her
words,
every
body's
words,
were
soon
lost
under
the
incessant
flow
of
Miss
Bates,
who
came
in
talking,
and
had
not
finished
her
speech
under
many
minutes
after
her
being
admitted
into
the
circle
at
the
fire.
As
the
door
opened
she
was
heard,
"So
very
obliging
of
you!
