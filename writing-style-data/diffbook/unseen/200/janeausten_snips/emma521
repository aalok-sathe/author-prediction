were
under
continual
irritation
and
suffering;
and
by
the
ten
days'
end,
her
nephew's
letter
to
Randalls
communicated
a
change
of
plan.
They
were
going
to
remove
immediately
to
Richmond.
Mrs.
Churchill
had
been
recommended
to
the
medical
skill
of
an
eminent
person
there,
and
had
otherwise
a
fancy
for
the
place.
A
ready
furnished
house
in
a
favourite
spot
was
engaged,
and
much
benefit
expected
from
the
change.
Emma
heard
that
Frank
wrote
in
the
highest
spirits
of
this
arrangement,
and
seemed
most
fully
to
appreciate
the
blessing
of
having
two
months
before
him
of
such
near
neighbourhood

many
dear
friends

the
house
was
taken
for
May
and
June.
She
was
told
that
now
he
wrote
with
the
greatest
confidence
of
being
often
with
them,
almost
as
often
as
he
could
even
wish.
Emma
saw
how
Mr.
Weston
understood
these
joyous
prospects.
He
was
considering
her
as
the
source
of
all
the
happiness
they
offered.
She
hoped
it
was
not
so.
Two
months
must
bring
it
to
the
proof.
Mr.
Weston's
own
happiness
was
indisputable.
He
was
quite
delighted.
It
was
the
very
circumstance
he
could
have
wished
for.
Now,
it
would
be
really
having
Frank
