you
will
understand
that
Mr.
Elton
is
the
standard
of
perfection
in
Highbury,
both
in
person
and
mind."
"Very
true,
Miss
Woodhouse,
so
she
will.
He
is
the
very
best
young
man
But,
my
dear
Jane,
if
you
remember,
I
told
you
yesterday
he
was
precisely
the
height
of
Mr.
Perry.
Miss
Hawkins,
I
dare
say,
an
excellent
young
woman.
His
extreme
attention
to
my
mother
wanting
her
to
sit
in
the
vicarage
pew,
that
she
might
hear
the
better,
for
my
mother
is
a
little
deaf,
you
know
it
is
not
much,
but
she
does
not
hear
quite
quick.
Jane
says
that
Colonel
Campbell
is
a
little
deaf.
He
fancied
bathing
might
be
good
for
it
the
warm
bath
but
she
says
it
did
him
no
lasting
benefit.
Colonel
Campbell,
you
know,
is
quite
our
angel.
And
Mr.
Dixon
seems
a
very
charming
young
man,
quite
worthy
of
him.
It
is
such
a
happiness
when
good
people
get
together
and
they
always
do.
Now,
here
will
be
Mr.
Elton
and
Miss
Hawkins;
and
there
are
the
Coles,
such
very
good
people;
and
the
Perrys
I
suppose
there
never
was
a
happier
or
a
better
couple
than
Mr.
and
Mrs.
