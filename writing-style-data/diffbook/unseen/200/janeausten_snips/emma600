be
wearied
in
spirits.
Mine,
I
confess,
are
exhausted.
The
greatest
kindness
you
can
shew
me,
will
be
to
let
me
have
my
own
way,
and
only
say
that
I
am
gone
when
it
is
necessary."
Emma
had
not
another
word
to
oppose.
She
saw
it

and
entering

her
feelings,
promoted
her
quitting
the
house

and

her
safely

horrors,
the
more

Jane
had
not
been
gone
a
quarter
of
an
hour,
and
they
had
only

some
views
of
St.
Mark's
Place,
Venice,
when
Frank
Churchill
entered
the
room.
Emma
had
not
