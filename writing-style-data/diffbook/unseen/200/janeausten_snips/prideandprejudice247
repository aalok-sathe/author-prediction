contentment,
to
understand
her
address
in
guiding,
and
composure
in
bearing
with,
her
husband,
and
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
all
done
very
well.
She
had
also
to
anticipate
how
her
visit
would
pass,
the
quiet
tenor
of
their
usual
employments,
the
vexatious
interruptions
of
Mr.
Collins,
and
the
gaieties
of
their
intercourse
with
Rosings.
A

soon
settled
it

About

day,
as
she
was
in
her
room

for
a

into
the
dining
room,
for
there
is
such
a
sight
to
be
seen!
I
will
not
tell
you
what
it
is.
Make
haste,
and
come
down
this
moment."
Elizabeth
asked
questions
in
vain;
Maria
would
tell
her
nothing
more,
and
down
they
ran
into
the
dining
room,
which
fronted

in
quest
of
