called
the
garden
of
England,
as
well
as
Surry."
"No,
I
fancy
not,"
replied
Mrs.
Elton,
with
a
most
satisfied
smile.
"I
never
heard
any
county
but
Surry
called
so."
Emma
was
silenced.
"My
brother
and
sister
have
promised
us
a
visit
in
the
spring,
or
summer
at
farthest,"
continued
Mrs.
Elton;
"and
that
will
be
our
time
for
exploring.
While
they
are
with
us,
we
shall
explore
a
great
deal,
I
dare
say.
They
will
have
their
barouche
landau,
of
course,
which
holds
four
perfectly;
and
therefore,
without
saying
any
thing
of
our
carriage,
we
should
be
able
to
explore
the
different
beauties
extremely
well.
They
would
hardly
come
in
their
chaise,
I
think,
at
that
season
of
the
year.
Indeed,
when
the
time
draws
on,
I
shall
decidedly
recommend
their
bringing
the
barouche
landau;
it
will
be
so
very
much
preferable.
When
people
come
into
a
beautiful
country
of
this
sort,
you
know,
Miss
Woodhouse,
one
naturally
wishes
them
to
see
as
much
as
possible;
and
Mr.
Suckling
is
extremely
fond
of
exploring.
We
explored
to
King's
Weston
twice
last
summer,
in
that
way,
most
delightfully,
just
after
their
first
having
the
barouche
landau.
You
have
many
parties
