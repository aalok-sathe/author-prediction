it,
I
will
endeavour
to
persuade
them
both."
And
away
he
ran.
Long
before
he
reappeared,
attending
the
short,
neat,
brisk
moving
aunt,
and
her
elegant
niece,
Mrs.
Weston,
like
a
sweet
tempered
woman
and
a
good
wife,
had
examined
the
passage
again,
and
found
the
evils
of
it
much
less
than
she
had
supposed
before
indeed
very
trifling;
and
here
ended
the
difficulties
of
decision.
All
the
rest,
in
speculation
at
least,
was
perfectly
smooth.
All
the
minor
arrangements
of
table
and
chair,
lights
and
music,
tea
and
supper,
made
themselves;
or
were
left
as
mere
trifles
to
be
settled
at
any
time
between
Mrs.
Weston
and
Mrs.
Stokes.
Every
body
invited,
was
certainly
to
come;
Frank
had
already
written
to
Enscombe
to
propose
staying
a
few
days
beyond
his
fortnight,
which
could
not
possibly
be
refused.
And
a
delightful
dance
it
was
to
be.
Most
cordially,
when
Miss
Bates
arrived,
did
she
agree
that
it
must.
As
a
counsellor
she
was
not
wanted;
but
as
an
approver,
(a
much
safer
character,)
she
was
truly
welcome.
Her
approbation,
at
once
general
and
minute,
warm
and
incessant,
could
not
but
please;
and
for
another
half
hour
they
were
all
walking
