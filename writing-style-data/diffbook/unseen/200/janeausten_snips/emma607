any
cold
collation,
or
any
cheerful
Mr.
Weston,
to
remove.
At
first
it
was
downright
dulness
to
Emma.
She
had
never
seen
Frank
Churchill
so
silent
and
stupid.
He
said
nothing
worth
hearing
looked
without
seeing
admired
without
intelligence
listened
without
knowing
what
she
said.
While
he
was
so
dull,
it
was
no
wonder
that
Harriet
should
be
dull
likewise;
and
they
were
both
insufferable.
When
they
all
sat
down
it
was
better;
to
her
taste
a
great
deal
better,
for
Frank
Churchill
grew
talkative
and
gay,
making
her
his
first
object.
Every
distinguishing
attention
that
could
be
paid,
was
paid
to
her.
To
amuse
her,
and
be
agreeable
in
her
eyes,
seemed
all
that
he
cared
for
and
Emma,
glad
to
be
enlivened,
not
sorry
to
be
flattered,
was
gay
and
easy
too,
and
gave
him
all
the
friendly
encouragement,
the
admission
to
be
gallant,
which
she
had
ever
given
in
the
first
and
most
animating
period
of
their
acquaintance;
but
which
now,
in
her
own
estimation,
meant
nothing,
though
in
the
judgment
of
most
people
looking
on
it
must
have
had
such
an
appearance
as
no
English
word
but
flirtation
could
very
well
describe.

Frank
Churchill
