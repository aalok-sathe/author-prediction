the
very
thing
to
please
me."
Mr.
Knightley
had
another
reason
for
avoiding
a
table
in
the
shade.
He
wished
to
persuade
Mr.
Woodhouse,
as
well
as
Emma,
to
join
the
party;
and
he
knew
that
to
have
any
of
them
sitting
down
out
of
doors
to
eat
would
inevitably
make
him
ill.
Mr.
Woodhouse
must
not,
under
the
specious
pretence
of
a
morning
drive,
and
an
hour
or
two
spent
at
Donwell,
be
tempted
away
to
his
misery.
He
was
invited
on
good
faith.
No
lurking
horrors
were
to
upbraid
him
for
his
easy
credulity.
He
did
consent.
He
had
not
been
at
Donwell
for
two
years.
"Some
very
fine
morning,
he,
and
Emma,
and
Harriet,
could
go
very
well;
and
he
could
sit
still
with
Mrs.
Weston,
while
the
dear
girls
walked
about
the
gardens.
He
did
not
suppose
they
could
be
damp
now,
in
the
middle
of
the
day.
He
should
like
to
see
the
old
house
again
exceedingly,
and
should
be
very
happy
to
meet
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Elton,
and
any
other
of
his
neighbours.
He
could
not
see
any
objection
at
all
to
his,
and
Emma's,
and
Harriet's
going
there
some
very
fine
morning.
He
