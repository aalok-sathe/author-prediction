turned
to
her
again
and
seized
her
attention.
"My
mother's
deafness
is
very
trifling
you
see
just
nothing
at
all.
By
only
raising
my
voice,
and
saying
any
thing
two
or
three
times
over,
she
is
sure
to
hear;
but
then
she
is
used
to
my
voice.
But
it
is
very
remarkable
that
she
should
always
hear
Jane
better
than
she
does
me.
Jane
speaks
so
distinct!
However,
she
will
not
find
her
grandmama
at
all
deafer
than
she
was
two
years
ago;
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
at
my
mother's
time
of
life
and
it
really
is
full
two
years,
you
know,
since
she
was
here.
We
never
were
so
long
without
seeing
her
before,
and
as
I
was
telling
Mrs.
Cole,
we
shall
hardly
know
how
to
make
enough
of
her
now."
"Are
you
expecting
Miss
Fairfax
here
soon?"
"Oh
yes;
next
week."
"Indeed!
that
must
be
a
very
great
pleasure."
"Thank
you.
You
are
very
kind.
Yes,
next
week.
Every
body
is
so
surprized;
and
every
body
says
the
same
obliging
things.
I
am
sure
she
will
be
as
happy
to
see
her
friends
at
Highbury,
as
they
can
be
to
see
her.
Yes,
Friday
or
