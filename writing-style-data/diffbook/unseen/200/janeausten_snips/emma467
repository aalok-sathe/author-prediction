either
but
what
is
highly
conciliating.
I
shall
have
her
very
often
indeed
while
they
are
with
me,
and
I
dare
say
we
shall
sometimes
find
a
seat
for
her
in
the
barouche
landau
in
some
of
our
exploring
parties."
"Poor
Jane
Fairfax!"
thought
Emma.
"You
have
not
deserved
this.

and
she
was
left

neither
forced
to
be
the
very
particular
friend
of
Mrs.
Elton,
nor,
under
Mrs.
Elton's
guidance,
the
very
active
patroness
of
Jane
Fairfax,
and
only
sharing
