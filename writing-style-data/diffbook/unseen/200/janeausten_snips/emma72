behind
her
and
watching
every
touch.
She
gave
him
credit
for
stationing
himself
where
he
might
gaze
and
gaze
again
without
offence;
but
was
really
obliged
to
put
an
end
to
it,
and
request
him
to
place
himself
elsewhere.
It
then
occurred
to
her
to
employ
him
in
reading.
"If
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
read
to
them,
it
would
be
a
kindness
indeed!
It
would
amuse
away
the
difficulties
of
her
part,
and
lessen
the
irksomeness
of
Miss
Smith's."
Mr.
Elton
was
only
too
happy.
Harriet
listened,
and
Emma
drew
in
peace.
She
must
allow
him
to
be
still
frequently
coming
to
look;
any
thing
less
would
certainly
have
been
too
little

a
lover;
and
he
was
ready
at
the
smallest
intermission
of
the
pencil,
to
jump
up
and
see
the
progress,
and
be
charmed.
There
was
no
being
displeased
with
such
an
encourager,
for
his
admiration
made
him
discern
a
likeness
almost
before
it
was
possible.
She
could
not
respect
his
eye,
but
his
love
and
his
complaisance
were
unexceptionable.
The
sitting
was
altogether
very
satisfactory;
she
was
quite
enough
pleased
with
the
first
day's
sketch
to
wish
to
go
on.
There
was
no
want
