Mr.
Knightley
called
one
morning,
and
Jane
was
eating
these
apples,
and
we
talked
about
them
and
said
how
much
she
enjoyed
them,
and
he
asked
whether
we
were
not
got
to
the
end
of
our
stock.
'I
am
sure
you
must
be,'
said
he,
'and
I
will
send
you
another
supply;
for
I
have
a
great
many
more
than
I
can
ever
use.
William
Larkins
let
me
keep
a
larger
quantity
than
usual
this
year.
I
will
send
you
some
more,
before
they
get
good
for
nothing.'
So
I
begged
he
would
not
for
really
as
to
ours
being
gone,
I
could
not
absolutely
say
that
we
had
a
great
many
left
it
was
but
half
a
dozen
indeed;
but
they
should
be
all
kept
for
Jane;
and
I
could
not
at
all
bear
that
he
should
be
sending
us
more,
so
liberal
as
he
had
been
already;
and
Jane
said
the
same.
And
when
he
was
gone,
she
almost
quarrelled
with
me
No,
I
should
not
say
quarrelled,
for
we
never
had
a
quarrel
in
our
lives;
but
she
was
quite
distressed
that
I
had
owned
the
apples
were
so
nearly
gone;
she
wished
I
had
made
him
