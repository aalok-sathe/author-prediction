that
she
has
engaged
herself
before
their
return?"
"Yes;
Jane
says
she
is
sure
they
will;
but
yet,
this
is
such
a
situation
as
she
cannot
feel
herself
justified
in
declining.
I
was
so
astonished
when
she
first
told
me
what
she
had
been
saying
to
Mrs.
Elton,
and
when
Mrs.
Elton
at
the
same
moment
came
congratulating
me
upon
it!
It
was
before
tea
stay
no,
it
could
not
be
before
tea,
because
we
were
just
going
to
cards
and
yet
it
was
before
tea,
because
I
remember
thinking
Oh!
no,
now
I
recollect,
now
I
have
it;
something
happened
before
tea,
but
not
that.
Mr.
Elton
was
called
out
of
the
room
before
tea,
old
John
Abdy's
son
wanted
to
speak
with
him.
Poor
old
John,
I
have
a
great
regard
for
him;
he
was
clerk
to
my
poor
father
twenty
seven
years;
and
now,
poor
old
man,
he
is
bed
ridden,
and
very
poorly
with
the
rheumatic
gout
in
his
joints
I
must
go
and
see
him
to
day;
and
so
will
Jane,
I
am
sure,
if
she
gets
out
at
all.
And
poor
John's
son
came
to
talk
to
Mr.
Elton
about
relief
from
the
parish;
