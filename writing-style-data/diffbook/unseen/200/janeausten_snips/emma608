Miss
Woodhouse
flirted
together
excessively."
They
were
laying
themselves
open
to
that
very
phrase
and
to
having
it
sent
off
in
a
letter
to
Maple
Grove
by
one
lady,
to
Ireland
by
another.
Not
that
Emma
was
gay
and
thoughtless
from
any
real
felicity;
it
was
rather
because
she
felt
less
happy
than
she
had
expected.
She
laughed
because
she
was
disappointed;
and

you
were
too

I
was
a
kinder
friend
than
you
deserved.
But
you
were

You
begged
hard
to
be
commanded
to

"Don't
say
I
was

I
was
