could

The
Coles
were
very
respectable
in
their
way,
but
they
ought
to
be
taught
that
it
was
not
for
them
to
arrange
the
terms
on
which
the
superior
families
would
visit
them.
This
lesson,
she
very
much
feared,
they
would
receive
only
from
herself;
she
had
little
hope
of
Mr.
Knightley,
none
of
Mr.
Weston.
But
she
had
made
up
her
mind
how
to
meet
this
presumption
so
many
weeks
before
it
appeared,
that
when
the
insult
came
at
last,
it
found
her
very
differently
affected.
Donwell
and
Randalls
had
received
their
invitation,
and
none
had
come
for
her
father
and
herself;
and
Mrs.
Weston's
accounting
for
it
with
"I
suppose
they
will
not
take
the
liberty
with
you;
they
know
you
do
not
dine
out,"
was
not
quite
sufficient.
She
felt
that
she
should
like
to
have
had
the
power
of
refusal;
and
afterwards,
as
the
idea
of
the
party
to
be
assembled
there,
consisting
precisely
of
those
whose
society
was
dearest
to
her,
occurred
again
and
again,
she
did
not
know
that
she
might
not
have
been
tempted
to
accept.
Harriet
was
to
be
there
in
the
evening,
and
the
Bateses.
They
