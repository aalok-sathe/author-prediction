was
not
a
large
hand,
but
very
clear
and
certainly
strong.
Had
not
Mrs.
Weston
any
letter
about
her
to
produce?"
No,
she
had
heard
from
him
very
lately,
but
having
answered
the
letter,
had
put
it
away.
"If
we
were
in
the
other
room,"
said
Emma,
"if
I
had
my
writing
desk,
I
am
sure
I
could
produce
a
specimen.
I
have
a
note
of
his.
Do
not

Mrs.
Weston,

it
after

convince
Mr.

Miss
Woodhouse,

will,
of

Mrs.

be
spoken
to,
was
ready;
and
before
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
reached
her
with
his
request
to
be
allowed
to
hand
her
into
the
dining
parlour,
was
saying
"Must
I
go
first?
I
really
am
ashamed
of
always
leading
the
way."
Jane's
solicitude
about
fetching
her
own
letters

not

Emma.
She

and
