spirited
beginning
of
your
winter
engagements,
sir.
Something
new
for
your
coachman
and
horses
to
be
making
their
way
through
a
storm
of
snow."
Poor
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
silent
from
consternation;
but
every
body
else
had
something
to
say;
every
body
was
either
surprized
or
not
surprized,
and
had
some
question
to
ask,
or
some
comfort
to
offer.
Mrs.
Weston
and
Emma
tried
earnestly
to
cheer
him
and
turn
his
attention
from
his
son
in

who
was
pursuing

"I
admired
your
resolution

"in
venturing
out
in
such

saw
there
would
be
snow
very
soon.
Every
body
must
have
seen
the
snow
coming
on.
I
admired
your
spirit;
and
I
dare
say
we
shall
get
home
very
well.
Another
hour
or
two's
snow
can
hardly
make
the
road
impassable;
and
we
are
two
carriages;
if
one
is
blown
over
in
the
bleak
part
of
the
common
field
there
will
be
the
other
at
hand.
I
dare
say
we
shall
be
all
safe
at
Hartfield
before
midnight."
Mr.
Weston,
with
triumph
of
a
different
sort,
was
confessing
that
he
had
known
it
to
be
snowing
some
time,
