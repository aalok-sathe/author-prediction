person
with
whom
you
are
to
pass

"You
make
me
laugh,
Charlotte;
but
it
is
not
sound.
You
know
it
is
not
sound,
and
that
you
would
never
act
in
this
way

Occupied
in
observing
Mr.
Bingley's
attentions
to
her
sister,
Elizabeth
was
far

suspecting
that
she
was
herself
becoming
an
object
of
some
interest
in
the
eyes
of

and
in
spite
of
his
asserting
that
her
manners
were
