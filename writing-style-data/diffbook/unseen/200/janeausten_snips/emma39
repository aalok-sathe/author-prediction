a
dozen
people."
For
some
time
she
was
amused,
without
thinking
beyond
the
immediate
cause;
but
as
she
came
to
understand
the
family
better,
other
feelings
arose.
She
had
taken
up
a
wrong
idea,
fancying
it
was
a
mother
and
daughter,
a
son
and
son's
wife,
who
all
lived
together;
but
when
it
appeared
that
the
Mr.
Martin,
who
bore
a
part
in
the
narrative,
and
was
always
mentioned
with
approbation
for
his
great
good
nature
in
doing
something
or
other,
was
a
single
man;
that
there
was
no
young
Mrs.
Martin,
no
wife
in
the
case;
she
did
suspect
danger
to
her
poor
little
friend
from
all
this
hospitality
and
kindness,
and
that,
if
she
were
not
taken
care
of,
she
might
be
required
to
sink
herself
forever.
With
this
inspiriting
notion,
her
questions
increased
in
number
and
meaning;
and
she
particularly
led
Harriet
to
talk
more
of
Mr.
Martin,
and
there
was
evidently
no
dislike
to
it.
Harriet
was
very
ready
to
speak
of
the
share
he
had
had
in
their
moonlight
walks
and
merry
evening
games;
and
dwelt
a
good
deal
upon
his
being
so
very
good
humoured
and
obliging.
He

miles
