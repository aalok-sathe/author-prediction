love
her
really
too
well
to
be
unjust
or
unkind;
but
excuse
me,
Mr.
Knightley,
if
I
take
the
liberty
(I
consider
myself,
you
know,
as
having
somewhat
of
the
privilege
of
speech
that
Emma's
mother
might
have
had)
the
liberty
of
hinting
that
I
do
not
think
any
possible

arise
from
Harriet
Smith's
intimacy

any

of
office."
"Not
at

cried
he;
"I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
it.
It
is
very
good
advice,
and
it
shall
have
a
better
fate
than
your
advice
has
often
found;
for
it
shall
be
attended
to."
"Mrs.
John
Knightley
is
easily
alarmed,
and
might
be
made
unhappy
about
her
sister."
"Be
satisfied,"
said
he,
"I
will
not
raise
any
outcry.
