the
gardens?
She
wished
to
see
the
whole
extent."
The
pertinacity
of
her
friend
seemed
more
than
she
could
bear.
It
was
hot;
and
after
walking
some
time
over
the
gardens
in
a
scattered,
dispersed
way,
scarcely
any
three
together,
they
insensibly
followed
one
another
to
the
delicious
shade
of
a
broad
short
avenue
of
limes,
which
stretching
beyond
the
garden
at
an
equal
distance
from
the
river,
seemed
the
finish
of
the
pleasure
grounds.
It
led
to
nothing;
nothing
but
a
view
at
the
end
over
a
low
stone
wall
with
high
pillars,
which
seemed
intended,
in
their
erection,
to
give
the
appearance
of
an
approach
to
the
house,
which
never
had
been
there.
Disputable,
however,
as
might
be
the
taste
of
such
a
termination,
it
was
in
itself
a
charming
walk,
and
the
view
which
closed
it
extremely
pretty.
The
considerable
slope,
at
nearly
the
foot
of
which
the
Abbey
stood,
gradually
acquired
a
steeper
form
beyond
its
grounds;
and
at
half
a
mile
distant
was
a
bank
of
considerable
abruptness
and
grandeur,
well
clothed
with
wood;
and
at
the
bottom
of
this
bank,
favourably
placed
and
sheltered,
rose
the
Abbey
Mill
Farm,
with
meadows
