wholesome
food,
let
them
run
about
a
great
deal
in
the
summer,
and
in
winter
dressed
their
chilblains
with
her
own
hands.
It
was
no
wonder
that
a
train
of
twenty
young
couple
now
walked
after
her
to
church.
She
was
a
plain,
motherly

her
father
look
comfortable,
and
very
much
pleased
with
herself
for
contriving
things
so

but
the
quiet
prosings
of
three
such
women
made
her
feel
that
every
