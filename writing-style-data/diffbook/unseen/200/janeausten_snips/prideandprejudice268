more
than
once
during
the
time,
but
Mr.
Darcy
they
had
seen
only
at
church.
The
invitation
was
accepted
of
course,
and
at
a
proper
hour
they
joined
the
party
in
Lady
Catherine's
drawing
room.
Her
ladyship
received
them
civilly,
but
it
was
plain
that
their
company
was
by
no
means
so
acceptable
as
when
she
could
get
nobody
else;
and
she
was,
in

and
music,
that
Elizabeth
had
never
been
half
so
well
entertained
in
that
room
before;
and
they
conversed
with
so
much
spirit
and
flow,
as
to
draw
the
attention
of
Lady
Catherine
herself,
as
well
as
of
Mr.
Darcy.
His
eyes
had
been
soon
and
repeatedly
turned
towards
them
with
a
look
of
curiosity;
and
