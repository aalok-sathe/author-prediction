to
me.
It
would
be
such
a
delight
to
have
her
picture!"
"Let
me
entreat
you,"
cried
Mr.
Elton;
"it
would
indeed
be
a
delight!
Let
me
entreat
you,
Miss
Woodhouse,
to
exercise
so
charming
a
talent
in
favour
of
your
friend.
I
know
what
your
drawings
are.
How
could
you
suppose
me
ignorant?
Is
not
this
room
rich
in
specimens
of
your
landscapes

Mrs.
Weston
some
inimitable

her
drawing

you
give
me
such
kind
encouragement,
Mr.
Elton,
I
believe
I
shall
try
what
I

do.
Harriet's
features
are
very
delicate,
which
makes
a
likeness
difficult;
and
yet
there
is
a
peculiarity
in
the
shape
of
the
eye
and
the
lines
about
the
mouth
which
one
ought
to
catch."
"Exactly
so
The
shape
of
the
eye
and
the
lines
about
the
mouth
I
have
not
a
doubt
of
your
success.
Pray,
pray
attempt
it.
As
you
will
do
it,
