agitation
of
meeting
Mr.
Martin.
The
unhappiness
produced
by
the
knowledge
of
that
engagement
had
been
a
little
put
aside
by
Elizabeth
Martin's
calling
at
Mrs.
Goddard's
a
few
days
afterwards.
Harriet
had
not
been
at
home;
but
a
note
had
been
prepared
and
left
for
her,
written
in
the
very
style
to
touch;
a
small
mixture
of
reproach,
with
a
great
deal
of
kindness;
and
till
Mr.
Elton
himself
appeared,
she
had
been
much
occupied
by
it,
continually
pondering
over
what
could
be
done
in
return,
and
wishing
to
do
more
than
she
dared
to
confess.
But
Mr.
Elton,
in
person,
had
driven
away
all
such
cares.
While
he
staid,
the
Martins
were
forgotten;
and
on
the
very
morning
of
his
setting
off
for
Bath
again,
Emma,
to
dissipate
some
of
the
distress
it
occasioned,
judged
it
best
for
her
to
return
Elizabeth
Martin's
visit.
How
that
visit
was
to
be
acknowledged
what
would
be
necessary
and
what
might
be
safest,
had
been
a
point
of
some
doubtful
consideration.
Absolute
neglect
of
the
mother
and
sisters,
when
invited
to
come,
would
be
ingratitude.
It
must
not
be:
and
yet
the
danger
of
a
renewal
of
the
acquaintance
!
