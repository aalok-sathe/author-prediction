of
Mr.
Knightley?"
"To
be
sure
I
am.
I
never
could
have
an
idea
of
any
body
else
and
so
I
thought
you
knew.
When
we
talked
about
him,
it
was
as
clear
as
possible."
"Not
quite,"
returned
Emma,
with
forced
calmness,
"for
all
that
you
then
said,
appeared
to
me
to
relate
to
a
different
person.
I
could
almost
assert
that
you
had
named
Mr.
Frank
Churchill.
I
am
sure
the
service
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
had
rendered
you,
in
protecting
you
from
the
gipsies,
was
spoken
of."
"Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
how
you
do
forget!"
"My
dear
Harriet,
I
perfectly
remember
the
substance
of
what
I
said
on
the
occasion.
I
told
you
that
I
did
not
wonder
at
your
attachment;
that
considering
the
service
he
had
rendered
you,
it
was
extremely
natural:
and
you
agreed
to
it,
expressing
yourself
very
warmly
as
to
your
sense
of
that
service,
and
mentioning
even
what
your
sensations
had
been
in
seeing
him
come
forward
to
your
rescue.
The
impression
of
it
is
strong
on
my
memory."
"Oh,
dear,"
cried
Harriet,
"now
I
recollect
what
you
mean;
but
I
was
thinking
of
something
very
different
at
the
time.
It
was
not
the
gipsies
