The
wisest
and
the
best
of
men
nay,
the
wisest
and
best
of
their
actions
may
be
rendered
ridiculous
by
a
person
whose
first
object
in
life
is
a
joke."
"Certainly,"
replied
Elizabeth
"there
are
such
people,
but
I
hope
I
am
not
one
of
them.
I
hope

a

"Your
examination

Mr.

over,
I
presume,"
said
Miss
Bingley;
"and
pray
what
is
the
result?"
"I
am
perfectly
convinced
by
it
that
Mr.
Darcy
has
no

He
owns
