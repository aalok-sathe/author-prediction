among
her
own
confederates,
spoke
now.
"Such
things
do
occur,
undoubtedly."
She
was
stopped
by
a
cough.
Frank
Churchill
turned
towards
her
to
listen.
"You
were
speaking,"
said
he,
gravely.
She
recovered
her
voice.
"I
was
only
going
to
observe,
that
though
such
unfortunate
circumstances
do
sometimes
occur
both
to
men
and
women,
I
cannot
imagine
them
to
be
very
frequent.
A
hasty
and
imprudent
attachment
may
arise
but
there
is
generally
time
to
recover
from
it
afterwards.
I
would
be
understood
to
mean,
that
it
can
be
only
weak,
irresolute
characters,
(whose
happiness
must
be
always
at
the
mercy
of
chance,)
who
will
suffer
an
unfortunate
acquaintance
to
be
an
inconvenience,
an
oppression
for
ever."
He
made
no
answer;
merely
looked,
and
bowed
in
submission;
and
soon
afterwards
said,
in
a
lively
tone,
"Well,
I
have
so
little
confidence
in
my
own
judgment,
that
whenever
I
marry,
I
hope
some
body
will
chuse
my
wife
for
me.
Will
you?
(turning
to
Emma.)
Will
you
chuse
a
wife
for
me?
I
am
sure
I
should
like
any
body
fixed
on
by
you.
You
provide
for
the
family,
you
know,
(with
a
smile
at
his
father).
Find
some
body
for
me.
