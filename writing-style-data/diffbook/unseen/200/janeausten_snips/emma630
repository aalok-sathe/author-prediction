would
have
stood
out
in
such
a
kind
way
as
she
did,
and
refuse
to
take
Jane's
answer;
but
she
positively
declared
she
would
not
write
any
such
denial
yesterday,
as
Jane
wished
her;
she
would
wait
and,
sure
enough,
yesterday
evening
it
was
all
settled
that
Jane
should
go.
Quite
a
surprize
to
me!
I
had
not
the
least
idea!
Jane
took
Mrs.
Elton
aside,
and
told
her
at
once,
that
upon
thinking
over
the
advantages
of
Mrs.
Smallridge's
situation,
she
had
come
to

I
did
not

upon

hill,
while

were
walking

with
Mr.
Knightley.
'You
must
all
spend
your
evening
with
us,'
said
she
'I
positively
must
have
you
all
come.'"
"Mr.
Knightley
was
there
too,
was
he?"
"No,
not
Mr.
Knightley;
he
declined
it
from
the
first;
and
though
I
thought
he
would
come,
because
Mrs.
Elton
declared
she
would
not
let
him
off,
he
did
not;
but
my
mother,
and
Jane,
and
I,
were
all
there,
and
