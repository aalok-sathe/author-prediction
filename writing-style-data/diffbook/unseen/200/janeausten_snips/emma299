the
grandeur
of
the
connexion
seemed
dependent
on
the
elder
sister,
who
was
very
well
married,
to
a
gentleman
in
a
great
way,
near
Bristol,
who
kept
two
carriages!
That
was
the
wind
up
of
the
history;
that
was
the
glory
of
Miss
Hawkins.
Could
she
but
have
given
Harriet
her
feelings
about
it
all!
She
had
talked
her
into
love;
but,
alas!
she
was
not
so
easily
to
be
talked
out
of
it.
The
charm
of
an
object
to
occupy
the
many
vacancies
of
Harriet's
mind
was
not
to
be

He
might
be
superseded
by

would
have
been
sufficient;
but
nothing
else,
she
feared,
would
cure
her.
Harriet
was
one
of
those,
who,
having
once
begun,
would
be
always
in
love.
And
now,
poor
girl!
she
was
considerably
worse
from
this
reappearance
of
Mr.
Elton.
She
was
always
having
a
glimpse
of
him
somewhere
or
other.
Emma
saw
him
only
once;
but
two
or
three
times
every
day
Harriet
was
sure
just
to
meet
with
him,
or
just
to
miss
him,
just
to
hear
his
voice,
or
see
his
shoulder,
just
to
have
something
