ball,
and
abruptly
reminded
him
of
his
promise;
adding,
that
it
would
be
the
most
shameful
thing
in
the
world
if
he
did
not
keep
it.
His
answer
to
this
sudden
attack
was
delightful
to
their
mother's
ear:
"I
am
perfectly
ready,
I
assure
you,
to
keep
my
engagement;
and
when
your
sister
is
recovered,
you
shall,
if
you
please,
name
the
very
day
of
the
ball.
But
you
would
not
wish
to
be
dancing
when
she
is
ill."
Lydia
declared
herself
satisfied.
"Oh!
yes
it
would
be
much
better
to
wait
till
Jane
was
well,
and
by
that
time
most
likely
Captain
Carter
would
be
at
Meryton
again.
And
when
you
have
given
your
ball,"
she
added,
"I
shall
insist
on
their
giving
one
also.
I
shall
tell
Colonel
Forster
it
will
be
quite
a
shame
if
he
does
not."
Mrs.
Bennet
and
her
daughters
then
departed,
and
Elizabeth
returned
instantly
to
Jane,
leaving
her
own
and
her
relations'
behaviour
to
the
remarks
of
the
two
ladies
and
Mr.
Darcy;
the
latter
of
whom,
however,
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
join
in
their
censure
of
her,
in
spite
of
all
Miss
Bingley's
witticisms
on
fine
eyes.
The
