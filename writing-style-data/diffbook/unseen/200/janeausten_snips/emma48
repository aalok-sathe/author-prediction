without
air.
I
had
imagined
him,
I
confess,
a
degree
or
two
nearer
gentility."
"To
be
sure,"
said
Harriet,
in
a
mortified
voice,
"he
is
not
so
genteel
as
real
gentlemen."
"I
think,
Harriet,
since
your
acquaintance
with
us,
you
have
been
repeatedly
in
the
company
of
some
such
very
real
gentlemen,

struck
by
his
awkward
look
and
abrupt
manner,
and
the
uncouthness
of
a
voice
which
I
heard
to
be
wholly
unmodulated
as
I
stood
here."
"Certainly,
he
is
not
like
Mr.
Knightley.
He
has
not

a
fine
air
and
way
of
walking
as
Mr.
Knightley.
I
see
the
difference
