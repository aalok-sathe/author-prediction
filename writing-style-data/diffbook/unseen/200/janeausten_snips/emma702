intimation
of
his
being
returned
from
London.
She
had
been
thinking
of
him
the
moment
before,
as
unquestionably
sixteen
miles
distant.
There
was
time
only
for
the
quickest
arrangement
of
mind.
She
must
be
collected
and
calm.
In
half
a
minute
they
were
together.
The
"How
d'ye

were
quiet
and
constrained
on
each
side.
She
asked
after
their
mutual

his
plans
to
his
brother,
and
was
pained
by
the
manner
in
which
they
had
been
received.
They
walked
together.
He
was
silent.
She
thought
he
was
often
looking
at
her,
and
trying
for
a
fuller
view
of
her
face
