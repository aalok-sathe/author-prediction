end
of
people's
coming
to
him,
on
some
pretence
or
other.
The
magistrates,
and
overseers,
and
churchwardens,
are
always
wanting
his
opinion.
They
seem
not
able
to
do
any
thing
without
him.
'Upon
my
word,
Mr.
E.,'
I
often
say,
'rather
you
than
I.
I
do
not
know
what
would
become
of
my
crayons

!

soon
as
he
could
disengage
himself
from
Knightley;
but
he
and
Knightley
are
shut
up
together
in
deep
consultation.
Mr.
E.
is
Knightley's
right
hand."
Emma
would
not
have
smiled
for
the
world,
and
only
said,
"Is
Mr.
Elton
gone
on
foot
to
Donwell?
He
will
have
a
hot
walk."
"Oh!
no,
it
is
a
meeting
at
the
Crown,
