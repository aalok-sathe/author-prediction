She
was
as
happy
as
possible
with
the
Martins
in
the
summer.
She
had
no
sense
of
superiority
then.
If
she
has
it
now,
you
have
given
it.
You
have
been
no
friend
to
Harriet
Smith,
Emma.
Robert
Martin
would
never
have
proceeded
so
far,
if
he
had
not
felt
persuaded
of
her
not
being
disinclined
to
him.
I
know
him
well.
He
has
too
much
real
feeling
to
address
any
woman
on
the

passion.
And
as
to
conceit,
he
is
the
farthest
from

It
was
most
convenient
to
Emma
not
to
make
a
direct
reply
to
this
assertion;
she
chose
rather
to
take
up
her
own
line

the
subject
again.
"You

friend
to
Mr.
Martin;
but,
as
I
said
before,
are
unjust
to
Harriet.
Harriet's
claims
to
marry
well
are
not
so
contemptible
as
you
represent
them.
She
is
not
a
clever
girl,
but
she
has
better
sense
than
you
are
aware
of,
and
does
not
deserve
to
have
her
understanding
spoken
of
so
slightingly.
Waiving
that
point,
however,
and
supposing
her
to
be,
as
you
describe
her,
