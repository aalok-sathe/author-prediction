"I
wish
you
would
read
it
with
a
kinder
spirit
towards
him."
"Well,
there
is
feeling
here.
He
does
seem
to
have
suffered
in
finding
her
ill.
Certainly,
I
can
have
no
doubt
of
his
being
fond
of
her.
'Dearer,
much
dearer
than
ever.'
I
hope
he
may
long
continue
to
feel
all
the
value
of
such
a
reconciliation.
He
is
a
very
liberal
thanker,
with
his
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands.
'Happier
than
I
deserve.'
Come,
he
knows
himself
there.
'Miss
Woodhouse
calls
me
the
child
of
good
fortune.'
Those
were
Miss
Woodhouse's
words,
were
they?
And
a
fine
ending
and
there
is
the
letter.
The
child
of
good
fortune!
That
was
your
name
for
him,
was
it?"
"You
do
not
appear
so
well
satisfied
with
his
letter
as
I
am;
but
still
you
must,
at
least
I
hope
you
must,
think
the
better
of
him
for
it.
I
hope
it
does
him
some
service
with
you."
"Yes,
certainly
it
does.
He
has
had
great
faults,
faults
of
inconsideration
and
thoughtlessness;
and
I
am
very
much
of
his
opinion
in
thinking
him
likely
to
be
happier
than
he
deserves:
but
still
as
he
is,
beyond
a
doubt,
really
attached
