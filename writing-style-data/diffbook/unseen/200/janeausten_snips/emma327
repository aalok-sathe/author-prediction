Miss
Woodhouse,
you
were
speaking
to
me,
you
were
saying
something
at
the
very
moment
of
this
burst
of
my
amor
patriae.
Do
not
let
me
lose
it.
I
assure
you
the
utmost
stretch
of
public
fame
would
not
make
me
amends
for
the
loss
of
any
happiness
in
private
life."
"I
merely
asked,
whether
you
had
known
much
of
Miss
Fairfax
and
her
party
at
Weymouth."
"And
now
that
I
understand
your
question,
I
must
pronounce
it
to
be
a
very
unfair
one.
It
is
always
the
lady's
right
to
decide
on
the
degree
of
acquaintance.
Miss
Fairfax
must
already
have
given
her
account.
I
shall
not
commit
myself
by
claiming
more
than
she
may
chuse
to
allow."
"Upon
my
word!
you
answer
as
discreetly
as
she
could
do
herself.
But
her
account
of
every
thing
leaves
so
much
to
be
guessed,
she
is
so
very
reserved,
so
very
unwilling
to
give
the
least
information
about
any
body,
that
I
really
think
you
may
say
what
you
like
of
your
acquaintance
with
her."
"May
I,
indeed?
Then
I
will
speak
the
truth,
and
nothing
suits
me
so
well.
I
met
her
frequently
at
Weymouth.
I
had
known
the
Campbells
