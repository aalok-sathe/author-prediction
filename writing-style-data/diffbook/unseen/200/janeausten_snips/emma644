had
scarcely
a
stronger
regret
than
for
her
past
coldness;
and
the
person,
whom
she
had
been
so
many
months
neglecting,
was
now
the
very
one
on
whom
she
would
have
lavished
every
distinction
of
regard
or
sympathy.
She

possibility
of
her
going
to
Mrs.
Smallridge's
at
the
time
proposed.
Her
health
seemed
for
the
moment
completely
deranged

absolutely
alarming
symptoms,
