their
neighbourhood.
What
were
nine
miles
to
a
young
man?
An
hour's
ride.
He
would
be
always
coming
over.
The
difference
in
that
respect
of
Richmond
and
London
was
enough
to
make
the
whole
difference
of
seeing
him
always
and
seeing
him
never.
Sixteen
miles
nay,
eighteen
it
must
be
full
eighteen
to
Manchester
street
was
a
serious
obstacle.
Were
he
ever
able
to
get
away,
the
day
would
be
spent
in
coming
and
returning.
There
was
no
comfort
in
having
him
in
London;
he
might
as
well
be
at
Enscombe;
but
Richmond
was
the
very
distance
for
easy
intercourse.
Better
than
nearer!
One
good
thing
was
immediately
brought
to
a
certainty
by
this
removal,
the
ball
at
the
Crown.
It
had
not
been
forgotten
before,
but
it
had
been
soon
acknowledged
vain
to
attempt
to
fix
a
day.
Now,
however,
it
was
absolutely
to
be;
every
preparation
was
resumed,
and
very
soon
after
the
Churchills
had
removed
to
Richmond,
a
few
lines
from
Frank,
to
say
that
his
aunt
felt
already
much
better
for
the
change,
and
that
he
had
no
doubt
of
being
able
to
join
them
for
twenty
four
hours
at
any
given
time,
induced
them
to
