into
the
hall,
and
looked
at
neither.
There
was
no
time
for
farther
remark
or
explanation.
The
dream
must
be
borne
with,
and
Mr.
Knightley
must
take
his
seat
with
the
rest
round
the
large
modern
circular
table
which
Emma
had
introduced
at
Hartfield,
and
which
none
but
Emma
could
have
had
power
to
place
there
and
persuade
her
father
to
use,
instead
of
the
small
sized
Pembroke,
on
which
two
of
his
daily
meals
had,
for
forty
years
been
crowded.
Tea
passed
pleasantly,
and
nobody
seemed
in
a
hurry
to
move.
"Miss
Woodhouse,"
said
Frank
Churchill,
after
examining
a
table
behind
him,
which
he
could
reach
as
he
sat,
"have
your
nephews
taken
away
their
alphabets
their
box
of
letters?
It
used
to
stand
here.
Where
is
it?
This
is
a
sort
of
dull
looking
evening,
that
ought
to
be
treated
rather
as
winter
than
summer.
We
had
great
amusement
with
those
letters
one
morning.
I
want
to
puzzle
you
again."
Emma
was
pleased
with
the
thought;
and
producing
the
box,
the
table
was
quickly
scattered
over
with
alphabets,
which
no
one
seemed
so
much
disposed
to
employ
as
their
two
selves.
They
were
rapidly
forming
words
for
each
