long

"I
am
sorry
there
should
be
any
thing
like
doubt
in
the
case,"
replied
Emma;
"but
am
disposed
to
side
with
you,
Mr.
Weston.
If
you
think
he
will
come,
I
shall
think
so
too;
for
you
know
Enscombe."
"Yes
I
have
some
right
to
that
knowledge;
though
I
have
never
been
at
the
place
in
my
life.
She
is
an
odd
woman!
But
I
never
allow
myself
to
speak
ill
of
her,
on
Frank's
account;
for
I
do
believe
her
to
be
very
fond
of
him.
I
used
to
think
she
was
not
capable
of
being
fond
of
any
body,
except
herself:
but
she
has
always
been
kind
to
him
(in
her
way
allowing
for
little
whims
and
caprices,
and
expecting
every
thing
to
be
as
she
likes).
And
it
is
no
small
credit,
in
my
opinion,
to
him,
that
he
should
excite
such
an
affection;
for,
though
I
would
not
say
it
to
any
body
else,
she
has
no
more
heart
than
a
stone
to
people
in
general;
and
the
devil
of
a
temper."
Emma
liked
the
subject
so
well,
that
she
began
upon
it,
to
Mrs.
Weston,
very
soon
after
