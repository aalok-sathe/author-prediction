with
a
glow
of
regard.
She
was
warmly
gratified
and
in
another
moment
still
more
so,
by
a
little
movement
of
more
than
common
friendliness
on
his
part.
He
took
her
hand;
whether
she
had
not
herself
made
the
first
motion,
she
could
not
say
she
might,
perhaps,
have

he
took
her
hand,
pressed
it,
and
certainly
was
on

it
happened,
but
she
thought
nothing
became

more.
It
was

him,
of
so
simple,
yet
so
dignified
a
nature.
She
could
not
but
recall
the
attempt
with
great
satisfaction.
It
spoke
such
perfect
amity.
He
left
them
immediately
afterwards
gone
in
a
moment.
He
always
moved
with
the
alertness
of
a
mind
which
could
neither
be
undecided
nor
dilatory,
but
