conviction
had
been
given,
was
scarcely
the
work
of
a
moment.
I
cannot
blame
myself
for
having
done
thus
much.
There
is
but
one
part
of
my
conduct
in
the
whole
affair
on
which
I
do
not
reflect
with
satisfaction;
it
is
that
I
condescended
to
adopt
the
measures
of
art
so
far
as
to
conceal
from
him
your
sister's
being
in
town.
I
knew
it
myself,
as
it
was
known
to
Miss
Bingley;
but
her
brother
is
even
yet
ignorant
of
it.
That
they
might
have
met
without
ill
consequence
is
perhaps
probable;
but
his
regard
did
not
appear
to
me
enough
extinguished
for
him
to
see
her
without
some
danger.
Perhaps
this
concealment,
this
disguise
was
beneath
me;
it
is
done,
however,
and
it
was
done
for
the
best.
On
this
subject
I
have
nothing
more
to
say,
no
other
apology
to
offer.
If
I
have
wounded
your
sister's
feelings,
it
was
unknowingly
done
and
though
the
motives
which
governed
me
may
to
you
very
naturally
appear
insufficient,
I
have
not
yet
learnt
to
condemn
them.
"With
respect
to
that
other,
more
weighty
accusation,
of
having
injured
Mr.
Wickham,
I
can
only
refute
it
by
laying
before
you
