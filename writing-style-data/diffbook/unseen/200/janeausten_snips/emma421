to
and
fro,
between
the
different
rooms,
some
suggesting,
some
attending,
and
all
in
happy
enjoyment
of
the
future.
The
party
did
not
break
up
without
Emma's
being
positively
secured
for
the
two
first
dances
by
the
hero
of
the
evening,
nor
without
her
overhearing
Mr.
Weston
whisper
to
his
wife,
"He
has
asked
her,
my
dear.
That's
right.
I
knew
he
would!"
One
thing
only
was
wanting
to
make
the
prospect
of
the
ball
completely
satisfactory
to
Emma
its
being
fixed
for
a
day
within
the
granted
term
of
Frank
Churchill's
stay
in
Surry;
for,
in
spite
of
Mr.
Weston's
confidence,
she
could
not
think
it
so
very
impossible
that
the
Churchills
might
not
allow
their
nephew
to
remain
a
day
beyond
his
fortnight.
But
this
was
not
judged
feasible.
The
preparations
must
take
their
time,
nothing
could
be
properly
ready
till
the
third
week
were
entered
on,
and
for
a
few
days
they
must
be
planning,
proceeding
and
hoping
in
uncertainty
at
the
risk
in
her
opinion,
the
great
risk,
of
its
being
all
in
vain.
Enscombe
however
was
gracious,
gracious
in
fact,
if
not
in
word.
His
wish
of
staying
longer
evidently
did
not
please;
but
it
