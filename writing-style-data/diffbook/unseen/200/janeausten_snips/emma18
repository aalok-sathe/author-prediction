his
county,
then
embodied.
Captain
Weston
was
a
general
favourite;
and
when
the
chances
of
his
military
life
had
introduced
him
to
Miss
Churchill,
of
a
great
Yorkshire
family,
and
Miss
Churchill
fell
in
love
with
him,
nobody
was
surprized,
except
her
brother
and
his
wife,
who
had
never
seen
him,
and
who
were
full
of
pride
and
importance,
which
the
connexion
would
offend.
Miss
Churchill,
however,
being
of
age,
and

the
full
command
of
her
fortune
though

Mrs.
Weston
ought
to
have
found
more
in
it,
for
she
had
a
husband
whose
warm
heart
and
sweet
temper
made
him
think
every
thing
due
to
her
in
return
for
the
great
goodness
of
being
in
love
with
him;
but
though
she
had
one
sort
of
spirit,
she
had
not
the
best.
She
had
resolution
enough
to
pursue
her
own
will
in
spite
of
her
brother,
but
not
enough
to
refrain
