Jane
Fairfax
was
quite
ready
to
sit
down
to
the
pianoforte
again.
That
she
was
not
immediately
ready,
Emma
did
suspect
to
arise
from
the
state
of
her
nerves;
she
had
not
yet
possessed
the
instrument
long
enough
to
touch
it
without
emotion;
she
must
reason
herself
into
the
power
of
performance;
and
Emma
could
not
but
pity
such
feelings,
whatever
their
origin,
and
could
not
but
resolve
never
to
expose
them
to
her
neighbour
again.
At
last
Jane
began,
and
though
the
first
bars
were
feebly
given,
the
powers
of
the
instrument
were
gradually
done
full
justice
to.
Mrs.
Weston
had
been
delighted
before,
and
was
delighted
again;
Emma
joined
her
in
all
her
praise;
and
the
pianoforte,
with
every
proper
discrimination,
was
pronounced
to
be
altogether
of
the
highest
promise.
"Whoever
Colonel
Campbell
might
employ,"
said
Frank
Churchill,
with
a
smile
at
Emma,
"the
person
has
not
chosen
ill.
I
heard
a
good
deal
of
Colonel
Campbell's
taste
at
Weymouth;
and
the
softness
of
the
upper
notes
I
am
sure
is
exactly
what
he
and
all
that
party
would
particularly
prize.
I
dare
say,
Miss
Fairfax,
that
he
either
gave
his
friend
very
minute
directions,
or
wrote
to
