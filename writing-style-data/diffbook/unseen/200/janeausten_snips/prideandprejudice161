silence,
was
enjoying
the
scene.
Mr.
Bingley
and
Jane
were
standing
together,
a
little
detached
from
the
rest,
and
talked
only
to
each
other.
Elizabeth
preserved
as
steady
a
silence
as
either
Mrs.
Hurst
or
Miss
Bingley;
and
even
Lydia
was
too
much
fatigued
to
utter
more
than
the
occasional
exclamation
of
"Lord,
how
tired
I
am!"
accompanied
by
a
violent
yawn.
When
at
length
they
arose
to
take
leave,
Mrs.
Bennet
was
most
pressingly
civil
in
her
hope
of
seeing
the
whole
family
soon
at
Longbourn,
and
addressed
herself
especially
to
Mr.
Bingley,
to
assure
him
how
happy
he
would
make
them
by
eating
a
family
dinner
with
them
at
any
time,
without
the
ceremony
of
a
formal
invitation.
Bingley
was
all
grateful
pleasure,
and
he
readily
engaged
for
taking
the
earliest
opportunity
of
waiting
on
her,
after
his
return
from
London,
whither
he
was
obliged
to
go
the
next
day
for
a
short
time.
Mrs.
Bennet
was
perfectly
satisfied,
and
quitted
the
house
under
the
delightful
persuasion
that,
allowing
for
the
necessary
preparations
of
settlements,
new
carriages,
and
wedding
clothes,
she
should
undoubtedly
see
her
daughter
settled
at
Netherfield
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
months.
