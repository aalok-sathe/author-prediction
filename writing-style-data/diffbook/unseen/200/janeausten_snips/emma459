by
the
time
her
father
had
arranged
himself,
after
the
bustle
of
the
Eltons'
departure,
and
was
ready
to
speak,
she
was
very
tolerably
capable
of
attending.
"Well,
my
dear,"
he
deliberately
began,
"considering
we
never
saw
her
before,
she
seems
a
very
pretty
sort
of
young
lady;
and
I
dare
say
she
was
very
much
pleased
with
you.
She
speaks

been
able
to
wait
on
him
and
Mrs.
Elton
on
this
happy
occasion;
I
said
that
I
hoped
I
should
in
the
course
of
the
summer.
But
I
ought
to
have
gone
before.
Not
to
wait
upon
a
bride
is
very
remiss.
Ah!
it
shews
what
a
sad
invalid
I
am!
But
I
do
not

the
corner

Vicarage
Lane."
