than
a
few
first
chapters,
and
the
intention
of
going
on
to
morrow.
It
was
much
easier
to
chat
than
to
study;
much
pleasanter
to
let
her
imagination
range
and
work
at
Harriet's
fortune,
than
to
be
labouring
to
enlarge
her
comprehension
or
exercise
it
on
sober
facts;
and
the
only
literary
pursuit
which
engaged
Harriet
at
present,
the
only
mental
provision
she
was
making
for
the
evening
of
life,
was
the
collecting
and
transcribing
all
the
riddles
of
every
sort
that
she
could
meet
with,
into
a
thin
quarto
of
hot
pressed
paper,
made
up
by
her
friend,
and
ornamented
with
ciphers
and
trophies.
In
this
age
of
literature,
such
collections
on
a
very
grand
scale
are
not
uncommon.
Miss
Nash,
head
teacher
at
Mrs.
Goddard's,
had
written
out
at
least
three
hundred;
and
Harriet,
who
had
taken
the
first
hint
of
it
from
her,
hoped,
with
Miss
Woodhouse's
help,
to
get
a
great
many
more.
Emma
assisted
with
her
invention,
memory
and
taste;
and
as
Harriet
wrote
a
very
pretty
hand,
it
was
likely
to
be
an
arrangement
of
the
first
order,
in
form
as
well
as
quantity.
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
almost
as
much
interested
in
the
business
