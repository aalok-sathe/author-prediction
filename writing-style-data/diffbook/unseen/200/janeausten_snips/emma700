would
be
withdrawn;
and
if
to
these
losses,
the
loss
of
Donwell
were
to
be
added,
what
would
remain
of
cheerful
or
of
rational
society
within
their
reach?
Mr.
Knightley
to
be
no
longer
coming
there
for
his
evening
comfort!
No
longer
walking
in
at
all
hours,
as
if
ever
willing
to
change
his
own
home
for
their's!
How
was
it
to
be
endured?
And
if
he
were
to
be
lost
to
them
for
Harriet's
sake;
if
he
were
to
be
thought
of
hereafter,
as
finding
in
Harriet's
society
all
that
he
wanted;
if
Harriet
were
to
be
the
chosen,
the
first,
the
dearest,
the
friend,
the
wife
to
whom
he
looked
for
all
the
best
blessings
of
existence;
what
could
be
increasing
Emma's
wretchedness
but
the
reflection
never
far
distant
from
her
mind,
that
it
had
been
all
her
own
work?
When
it
came
to
such
a
pitch
as
this,
she
was
not
able
to
refrain
from
a
start,
or
a
heavy
sigh,
or
even
from
walking
about
the
room
for
a
few
seconds
and
the
only
source
whence
any
thing
like
consolation
or
composure
could
be
drawn,
was
in
the
resolution
of
her
own
better
conduct,
and
the
