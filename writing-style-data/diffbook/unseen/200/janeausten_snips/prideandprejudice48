the
occasion's
justifying
her
coming
so
far
alone.
The
latter
was
thinking
only
of
his
breakfast.
Her
inquiries
after
her
sister
were
not
very
favourably
answered.
Miss
Bennet
had
slept
ill,
and
though
up,
was
very
feverish,
and
not
well
enough
to
leave
her
room.
Elizabeth
was
glad
to
be
taken
to
her
immediately;
and
Jane,
who
had
only
been
withheld
by
the
fear
of
giving
alarm
or
inconvenience
from
expressing
in
her
note
how
much
she
longed
for
such
a
visit,
was
delighted
at
her
entrance.
She
was
not
equal,
however,
to
much
conversation,
and
when
Miss
Bingley
left
them

could
attempt
little

expressions
of
gratitude
for
the
extraordinary
kindness

was
treated
with.
Elizabeth
silently
attended
her.
When
breakfast
was

they
were
joined
by
the
sisters;
and
Elizabeth
began
to
like
them
herself,
when
she
saw
how
much
affection
and
solicitude
they
showed
for
Jane.
The
apothecary
came,
and
having
examined
his
patient,
said,
as
might
be
supposed,
that
she
had
caught
a
violent
cold,
and
that
they
must
endeavour
to
get
the
better
of
it;
advised
her
to
return
to
bed,
and
promised
her
some
draughts.
The
advice
was
followed
readily,
for
the
feverish
