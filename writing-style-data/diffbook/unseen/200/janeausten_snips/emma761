Knightley!
Can
you
explain
it?"
Emma
amused
herself
by
protesting
that
it
was
very
extraordinary,
indeed,
and
that
she
had
not
a
syllable
to
say
for
him.
"I
cannot
imagine,"
said
Mrs.
Elton,
(feeling
the
indignity
as
a
wife
ought
to
do,)
"I
cannot
imagine
how
he
could
do
such
a
thing
by
you,
of
all
people
in
the
world!
The
very
last
person
whom
one
should
expect
to
be
forgotten!
My
dear
Mr.
E.,
he
must
have
left
a
message
for
you,
I
am
sure
he
must.
Not
even
Knightley
could
be
so
very
eccentric;
and
his
servants
forgot
it.
Depend
upon
it,
that
was
the
case:
and
very
likely
to
happen
with
the
Donwell
servants,
who
are
all,
I
have
often
observed,
extremely
awkward
and
remiss.
I
am
sure
I
would
not
have
such
a
creature
as
his
Harry
stand
at
our
sideboard
for
any
consideration.
And
as
for
Mrs.
Hodges,
Wright
holds
her
very
cheap
indeed.
She
promised
Wright
a
receipt,
and
never
sent
it."
"I
met
William
Larkins,"
continued
Mr.
Elton,
"as
I
got
near
the
house,
and
he
told
me
I
should
not
find
his
master
at
home,
but
I
did
not
believe
him.
William
