if
she
fall
into
bad
hands,
may
be
teased,
and
kept
at
a
distance
from
those
she
wants
to
be
with;
but
one
cannot
comprehend
a
young
man's
being
under
such
restraint,
as
not
to
be
able
to
spend
a
week
with
his
father,
if
he
likes
it."
"One
ought
to
be
at
Enscombe,
and
know
the
ways
of
the
family,
before
one
decides
upon
what
he
can
do,"
replied
Mrs.
Weston.
"One
ought
to
use
the
same
caution,
perhaps,
in
judging
of
the
conduct
of
any
one
individual
of
any
one
family;
but
Enscombe,
I
believe,
certainly
must
not
be
judged
by
general
rules:
she
is
so
very
unreasonable;
and
every
thing
gives
way
to
her."
"But
she
is
so
fond
of
the
nephew:
he
is
so
very
great
a
favourite.
Now,
according
to
my
idea
of
Mrs.
Churchill,
it
would
be
most
natural,
that
while
she
makes
no
sacrifice
for
the
comfort
of
the
husband,
to
whom
she
owes
every
thing,
while
she
exercises
incessant
caprice
towards
him,
she
should
frequently
be
governed
by
the
nephew,
to
whom
she
owes
nothing
at
all."
"My
dearest
Emma,
do
not
pretend,
with
your
sweet
temper,
to
understand
a
bad
one,
