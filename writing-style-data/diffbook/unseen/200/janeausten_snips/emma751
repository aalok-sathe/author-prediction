half
an
hour
of
this
holiday
of
spirits
in
calling
on
Miss
Fairfax.
She
ought
to
go
and
she
was
longing
to
see
her;
the
resemblance
of
their
present
situations
increasing
every
other
motive
of
goodwill.
It
would
be
a
secret
satisfaction;
but
the
consciousness
of
a
similarity
of
prospect
would
certainly
add
to
the
interest
with
which
she
should
attend
to
any
thing
Jane
might
communicate.
She
went
she
had
driven
once
unsuccessfully
to
the
door,
but
had
not
been
into
the
house
since
the
morning
after
Box
Hill,
when
poor
Jane
had
been
in
such
distress
as
had
filled
her
with
compassion,
though
all
the
worst
of
her
sufferings
had
been
unsuspected.
The
fear
of
being
still
unwelcome,
determined
her,
though
assured
of
their
being
at
home,
to
wait
in
the
passage,
and
send
up
her
name.
She
heard
Patty
announcing
it;
but
no
such
bustle
succeeded
as
poor
Miss
Bates
had
before
made
so
happily
intelligible.
No;
she
heard
nothing
but
the
instant
reply
of,
"Beg
her
to
walk
up;"
and
a
moment
afterwards
she
was
met
on
the
stairs
by
Jane
herself,
coming
eagerly
forward,
as
if
no
other
reception
of
her
were
felt
sufficient.
