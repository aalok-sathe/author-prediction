But
while
so
many
were
devoting
him
to
Emma,
and
Emma
herself
making
him
over
to
Harriet,
Mr.
Knightley
began
to
suspect
him
of
some
inclination
to
trifle
with
Jane
Fairfax.
He
could
not
understand
it;
but
there
were
symptoms
of
intelligence
between
them
he
thought
so
at
least
symptoms
of
admiration
on
his
side,
which,
having
once
observed,
he
could
not
persuade
himself
to
think
entirely

again
in

company,
he
could
not
help
remembering
what
he
had
seen;
nor
could
he
avoid
observations
which,
unless
it
were
like
Cowper
and
his
fire
at
twilight,
"Myself
creating
what
I

him
yet
stronger
suspicion
of
there
being
a
something
of
private
liking,
