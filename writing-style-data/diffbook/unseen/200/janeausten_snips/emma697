her
sense
of
past
injustice
towards
Miss
Fairfax.
She
bitterly
regretted
not
having
sought
a
closer
acquaintance
with
her,
and
blushed
for
the
envious
feelings
which
had
certainly
been,
in
some
measure,
the
cause.
Had
she
followed
Mr.
Knightley's
known
wishes,
in
paying
that
attention
to
Miss
Fairfax,
which
was
every
way
her
due;
had
she
tried
to
know
her
better;
had
she
done
her
part
towards
intimacy;
had
she
endeavoured
to
find
a
friend
there
instead
of
in
Harriet
Smith;
she
must,
in
all
probability,
have
been

education,
had
been
equally
marking
one
as
an
associate
for
her,
to
be
received
with
gratitude;
and
the
other
what
was
she?
Supposing
even
that
they
had
never
become
intimate
friends;
that
she
had
never
been
admitted
into
Miss
Fairfax's
confidence
on
this
important
matter
which
was
most
probable
still,
in
knowing
her
as
she
ought,
and
as
she
might,
she
must
have
been
preserved
from
the
abominable
suspicions
of
an
improper
attachment
to
Mr.
Dixon,
which
she
had
not
only
so
foolishly
fashioned
and
harboured
herself,
but
had
so
unpardonably
imparted;
an
idea
which
she
greatly
feared
had
been
