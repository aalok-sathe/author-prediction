in
the
world
if
he
were
left
to
himself;
and
though
there
was
no
being
attached
to
the
aunt,
he
acknowledged
her
kindness
with
gratitude,
and
seemed
to
mean
always
to
speak
of
her
with
respect.
This
was
all
very
promising;
and,
but
for
such
an
unfortunate
fancy
for
having
his
hair
cut,
there
was
nothing
to
denote
him
unworthy
of
the
distinguished
honour
which
her
imagination
had
given
him;
the
honour,
if
not
of
being
really
in
love
with
her,
of
being
at
least
very
near
it,
and
saved
only
by
her
own
indifference
(for
still
her
resolution
held
of
never
marrying)
the
honour,
in
short,
of
being
marked
out
for
her
by
all
their
joint
acquaintance.
Mr.
Weston,
on
his
side,
added
a
virtue
to
the
account
which
must
have
some
weight.
He
gave
her
to
understand
that
Frank
admired
her
extremely
thought
her
very
beautiful
and
very
charming;
and
with
so
much
to
be
said
for
him
altogether,
she
found
she
must
not
judge
him
harshly.
As
Mrs.
Weston
observed,
"all
young
people
would
have
their
little
whims."
There
was
one
person
among
his
new
acquaintance
in
Surry,
not
so
leniently
disposed.
In
general
he
was
judged,
