would
be
an
excellent
match;
and
only
too
palpably
desirable,
natural,
and
probable,
for
her
to
have
much
merit
in
planning
it.
She
feared
it
was
what
every
body
else
must
think
of
and
predict.
It
was
not
likely,
however,
that
any
body
should
have
equalled
her
in
the
date
of
the
plan,
as
it
had
entered
her
brain
during
the
very
first
evening
of
Harriet's
coming
to
Hartfield.
The
longer
she
considered
it,
the
greater
was
her
sense
of
its
expediency.
Mr.
Elton's
situation
was
most
suitable,
quite
the
gentleman
himself,
and
without
low
connexions;
at
the
same
time,
not
of
any
family
that
could
fairly
object
to
the
doubtful
birth
of
Harriet.
He
had
a
comfortable
home
for
her,
and
Emma
imagined
a
very
sufficient
income;
for
though
the
vicarage
of
Highbury
was
not
large,
he
was
known
to
have
some
independent
property;
and
she
thought
very
highly
of
him
as
a
good
humoured,
well
meaning,
respectable
young
man,
without
any
deficiency
of
useful
understanding
or
knowledge
of
the
world.
She
had
already
satisfied
herself
that
he
thought
Harriet
a
beautiful
girl,
which
she
trusted,
with
such
frequent
meetings
at
Hartfield,
was
foundation
enough
on
his
side;
and
