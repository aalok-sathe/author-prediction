replied,
speaking
very
distinctly,
"that
he
told
me
she
had
accepted
him;
and
that
there
was
no
obscurity,
nothing
doubtful,
in
the
words
he
used;
and
I
think
I
can
give
you
a
proof
that
it
must
be
so.
He
asked
my
opinion
as
to
what
he
was
now
to
do.
He
knew
of
no
one
but
Mrs.
Goddard
to
whom
he
could
apply
for
information
of
her
relations
or
friends.
Could
I
mention
any
thing
more

to
be

to

Mrs.
Goddard?
I
assured
him
that
I
could
not.

he
would
endeavour
to
see
her
in
the
course
of
this
day."
"I
am
perfectly
satisfied,"
replied
Emma,
with
the
brightest
smiles,
"and
most
sincerely
wish
them
happy."
"You
are
materially
changed
since
we
talked
on
this
subject
before."
"I
hope
so
for
at
that
time
I
was
a
fool."
"And
I
am
changed
also;
for
I
am
now
very
willing
to
grant
you
all
Harriet's
good
qualities.
I
have
taken
some
pains
for
your
sake,
and
for
Robert
Martin's
sake,
(whom
I
have
always
had
reason
to
believe
as
much
in
love
with
her
as
ever,)
to
get
acquainted
with
her.
