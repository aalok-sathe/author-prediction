being
able
to
make
their
opinions
the
same.
Harriet
listened
submissively,
and
said
"it
was
very
true
it
was
just
as
Miss
Woodhouse
described
it
was
not
worth
while
to
think
about
them
and
she
would
not
think
about
them
any
longer"
but
no
change
of
subject
could
avail,
and
the
next
half
hour
saw
her
as
anxious
and
restless
about
the
Eltons
as
before.
At
last
Emma
attacked
her
on
another
ground.
"Your
allowing
yourself
to
be
so
occupied
and
so
unhappy
about
Mr.
Elton's
marrying,
Harriet,
is
the
strongest
reproach
you
can
make
me.
You
could
not
give
me
a
greater
reproof
for
the
mistake
I
fell
into.
It
was
all
my
doing,
I
know.
I
have
not
forgotten
it,
I
assure
you.
Deceived
myself,
I
did
very
miserably
deceive
you
and
it
will
be
a
painful
reflection
to
me
for
ever.
Do
not
imagine
me
in
danger
of
forgetting
it."
Harriet
felt
this
too
much
to
utter
more
than
a
few
words
of
eager
exclamation.
Emma
continued,
"I
have
not
said,
exert
yourself
Harriet
for
my
sake;
think
less,
talk
less
of
Mr.
Elton
for
my
sake;
because
for
your
own
sake
rather,
I
would
wish
it
