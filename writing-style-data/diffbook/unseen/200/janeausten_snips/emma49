air
is
so
remarkably
good
that
it
is
not
fair
to
compare
Mr.
Martin
with
him.
You
might
not
see
one
in
a
hundred
with
gentleman
so
plainly
written
as
in
Mr.
Knightley.
But
he
is
not
the
only
gentleman
you
have
been
lately
used
to.
What
say
you
to
Mr.
Weston
and
Mr.
Elton?
Compare
Mr.
Martin
with
either
of
them.
Compare
their
manner
of
carrying
themselves;
of
walking;
of
speaking;
of
being
silent.
You
must
see
the
difference."
"Oh
yes!
there
is
a
great
difference.
But
Mr.
Weston
is
almost
an
old
man.
Mr.
Weston
must
be
between
forty
and
fifty."
"Which
makes
his
good
manners
the
more
valuable.
The
older
a
person
grows,
Harriet,
the
more
important
it
is
that
their
manners
should
not
be
bad;
the
more
glaring
and
disgusting
any
loudness,
or
coarseness,
or
awkwardness
becomes.
What
is
passable
in
youth
is
detestable
in
later
age.
Mr.
Martin
is
now
awkward
and
abrupt;
what
will
he
be
at
Mr.
Weston's
time
of
life?"
"There
is
no
saying,
indeed,"
replied
Harriet
rather
solemnly.
"But
there
may
be
pretty
good
guessing.
He
will
be
a
completely
gross,
vulgar
farmer,
totally
inattentive
to
appearances,
and
thinking
of
nothing
