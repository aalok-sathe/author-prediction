those
kind
relations
to
whom
she
was
so
very
dear:
and
the
Campbells,
whatever
might
be
their
motive
or
motives,
whether
single,
or
double,
or
treble,
gave
the
arrangement
their
ready
sanction,
and
said,
that
they
depended
more
on
a
few
months
spent
in

Why
she

be
a
difficult
question
to
answer;
Mr.
Knightley
had
once
told
her
it
