had
supposed.
Absolutely
insufferable!
Knightley!
I
could
not
have
believed
it.
Knightley!
never
seen
him
in
her
life
before,
and
call
him
Knightley!
and
discover
that
he
is
a
gentleman!
A
little
upstart,
vulgar
being,
with
her
Mr.
E.,
and
her
caro
sposo,
and
her
resources,
and
all

Oh!
what

Frank
Churchill

How
angry
and
how
diverted
he
would
be!
Ah!
there
I
am

How
