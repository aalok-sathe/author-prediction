of
forgetting
Mr.
Elton
for
a
while
made
her
rather
sorry
to
find,
when
they
had
all
taken
their
places,
that
he
was
close
to
her.
The
difficulty
was
great
of
driving
his
strange
insensibility
towards
Harriet,
from
her
mind,
while
he
not
only
sat
at
her
elbow,
but
was
continually
obtruding
his
happy
countenance
on
her
notice,
and
solicitously
addressing
her

every
occasion.
Instead
of
forgetting
him,
his
behaviour
was
such

and
at
last
would
begin
admiring
her
drawings
with
so
much
zeal
and
so
little
knowledge
as
seemed
terribly
like
a
would
be
lover,
and
made
it
some
effort
with
her
to
preserve
her
good
manners.
For
her
own
sake
she
could
not
be
rude;
and
for
Harriet's,
in
the
hope
that
all
would
yet
turn
out
right,
she
was
even
positively
civil;
