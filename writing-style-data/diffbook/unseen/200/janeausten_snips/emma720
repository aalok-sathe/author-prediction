feeling
the
full
weight
of
their
separate
claims;
and
how
to
guard
the
comfort
of
both
to
the
utmost,
was
the
question.
With
respect
to
her
father,
it
was
a
question
soon
answered.
She
hardly
knew
yet
what
Mr.
Knightley
would
ask;
but
a
very
short
parley
with
her
own
heart
produced
the
most
solemn
resolution
of
never
quitting
her
father.
She
even
wept
over
the
idea
of
it,
as
a
sin
of
thought.
While
he
lived,
it
must
be
only
an
engagement;
but
she
flattered
herself,
that
if
divested
of
the
danger
of
drawing
her
away,
it
might
become
an
increase
of
comfort
to
him.
How
to
do
her
best
by
Harriet,
was
of
more
difficult
decision;
how
to
spare
her
from
any
unnecessary
pain;
how
to
make
her
any
possible
atonement;
how
to
appear
least
her
enemy?
On
these
subjects,
her
perplexity
and
distress
were
very
great
and
her
mind
had
to
pass
again
and
again
through
every
bitter
reproach
and
sorrowful
regret
that
had
ever
surrounded
it.
She
could
only
resolve
at
last,
that
she
would
still
avoid
a
meeting
with
her,
and
communicate
all
that
need
be
told
by
letter;
that
it
would
be
inexpressibly
desirable
