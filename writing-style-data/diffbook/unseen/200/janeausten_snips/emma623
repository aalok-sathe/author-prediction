evening
of
back
gammon
with
her
father,
was
felicity
to
it.
There,
indeed,
lay
real
pleasure,
for
there
she
was
giving
up
the
sweetest
hours
of
the
twenty
four
to
his
comfort;
and
feeling
that,
unmerited
as
might
be
the
degree
of
his
fond
affection
and
confiding
esteem,
she
could
not,
in
her
general
conduct,
be
open
to
any
severe
reproach.
As
a
daughter,
she
hoped
she
was
not

She

perhaps,
more
in
thought
than
fact;
scornful,
ungracious.
But
it
should
be
so
no
more.
In
the
warmth
of
true
contrition,
she
would
call
upon
her
the
very
next
morning,
and
it
should
be
the
beginning,
on
her
side,
of
a
regular,
equal,
kindly
intercourse.
She
was
just
as
determined
when
the
morrow
came,
and
went
early,
that
nothing
might
prevent
her.
It
was
not
unlikely,
