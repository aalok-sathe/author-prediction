"Indeed,
the
truth
was,
that
poor
dear
Jane
could
not
bear
to
see
any
body
any
body
at
all
Mrs.
Elton,
indeed,
could
not
be
denied
and
Mrs.
Cole
had
made
such
a
point
and
Mrs.
Perry
had
said
so
much
but,
except
them,
Jane
would
really
see
nobody."
Emma
did
not
want
to
be
classed
with
the
Mrs.
Eltons,
the
Mrs.
Perrys,
and
the
Mrs.
Coles,
who
would
force
themselves
anywhere;
neither
could
she
feel
any

therefore,
and
only
questioned

could
command
(and
never
had
any
body
such
good
neighbours)
was
distasteful.
Emma,
on
reaching
home,
called
the
housekeeper
directly,
to
an
examination
of
her
stores;
and
some
arrowroot
of
very
superior
quality
was
speedily
despatched
to
Miss
Bates
with
a
most
friendly
note.
In
half
an
hour
the
arrowroot
was
returned,
with
a
thousand
thanks
from
Miss
Bates,
but
"dear
Jane
would
not
be
satisfied
without
