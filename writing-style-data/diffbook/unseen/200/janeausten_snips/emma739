Bad.
He
ought
not
to
have
formed
the
engagement.
'His
father's
disposition:'
he
is
unjust,
however,
to
his
father.
Mr.
Weston's
sanguine
temper
was
a
blessing
on
all
his
upright
and
honourable
exertions;
but
Mr.
Weston
earned
every
present
comfort
before
he
endeavoured
to
gain
it.
Very
true;
he
did
not
come
till
Miss
Fairfax
was
here."
"And
I
have
not
forgotten,"
said
Emma,
"how
sure
you
were
that
he
might
have
come
sooner
if
he
would.
You
pass
it
over
very
handsomely
but
you
were
perfectly
right."
"I
was
not
quite
impartial
in
my
judgment,
Emma:
but
yet,
I
think
had
you
not
been
in
the
case
I
should
still
have
distrusted
him."
When
he
came
to
Miss
Woodhouse,
he
was
obliged
to
read
the
whole
of
it
aloud
all
that
related
to
her,
with
a
smile;
a
look;
a
shake
of
the
head;
a
word
or
two
of
assent,
or
disapprobation;
or
merely
of
love,
as
the
subject
required;
concluding,
however,
seriously,
and,
after
steady
reflection,
thus
"Very
bad
though
it
might
have
been
worse.
Playing
a
most
dangerous
game.
Too
much
indebted
to
the
event
for
his
acquittal.
No
judge
of
his
own
manners
by
you.
Always
