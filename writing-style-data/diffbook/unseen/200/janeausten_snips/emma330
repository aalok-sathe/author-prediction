Miss
Campbell,
would
have
been
at
all
agreeable
to
me.
I
could
not
excuse
a
man's
having
more
music
than
love
more
ear
than
eye
a
more
acute
sensibility
to
fine
sounds
than
to
my
feelings.
How
did
Miss
Campbell
appear
to
like
it?"
"It
was
her
very
particular
friend,
you
know."
"Poor
comfort!"
said
Emma,
laughing.
"One
would
rather
have
a
stranger
preferred
than
one's
very
particular
friend
with
a
stranger
it
might
not
recur
again
but
the
misery
of
having
a
very
particular
friend
always
at
hand,
to
do
every
thing
better
than
one
does
oneself!
Poor
Mrs.
Dixon!
Well,
I
am
glad
she
is
gone
to
settle
in
Ireland."
"You
are
right.
It
was
not
very
flattering
to
Miss
Campbell;
but
she
really
did
not
seem
to
feel
it."
"So
much
the
better
or
so
much
the
worse:
I
do
not
know
which.
But
be
it
sweetness
or
be
it
stupidity
in
her
quickness
of
friendship,
or
dulness
of
feeling
there
was
one
person,
I
think,
who
must
have
felt
it:
Miss
Fairfax
herself.
She
must
have
felt
the
improper
and
dangerous
distinction."
"As
to
that
I
do
not
"
"Oh!
do
not
imagine
that
I
expect
