rich,
and
by
refusing
your
hand,
do
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
your
being
otherwise.
In
making
me
the
offer,
you
must
have
satisfied
the
delicacy
of
your
feelings
with
regard
to
my
family,
and
may
take
possession
of
Longbourn
estate
whenever
it
falls,
without
any
self
reproach.
This
matter
may
be
considered,
therefore,
as
finally
settled."
And
rising
as
she
thus
spoke,
she
would
have
quitted
the
room,
had
Mr.

not

I
know

to
be
the
established
custom
of
your
sex
to
reject
a
man
on
the
first
application,
and
perhaps
you
have
even
now
said
as
much
to
encourage
my
suit
as
would
be
consistent
with
the
true
delicacy
of
the
female
character."
"Really,
Mr.
Collins,"
cried
Elizabeth
with
some
warmth,
"you
puzzle
me
exceedingly.
If
what
I
have
hitherto
said
can
appear
to
you
in
the
form
of
encouragement,
I
know
not
how
to
express
my
refusal
in
such
