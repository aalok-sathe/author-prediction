do

any
good!
This
will
certainly
be
the
beginning
of
one
of
our
quarrels
about
Emma,
Mr.
Knightley."
"Perhaps
you
think
I
am
come
on
purpose
to
quarrel
with
you,
knowing
Weston
to
be
out,
and
that
you
must
still
fight
your
own
battle."
"Mr.
Weston
would
undoubtedly
support
me,
if
he
were
here,
for
he
thinks
exactly
as
I
do
on
the
subject.
We
were
speaking
of
it
only
yesterday,
and
agreeing
how
fortunate
it
was
for
Emma,
that
there
should
be
such
a
girl
in
Highbury
for
her
to
associate
with.
Mr.
Knightley,
I
shall
not
allow
you
to
be
a
fair
judge
in
this
case.
You
are
so
much
used
to
live
alone,
that
you
do
not
know
the
value
of
a
companion;
and,
perhaps
no
man
can
be
a
good
judge
of
the
comfort
a
woman
feels
in
the
society
of
one
of
her
own
sex,
after
being
used
to
it
all
her
life.
I
can
imagine
your
objection
to
Harriet
Smith.
She
is
not
the
superior
young
woman
which
Emma's
friend
ought
to
be.
But
on
the
other
hand,
as
Emma
wants
to
see
her
better
informed,
it
will
be
an
inducement
to
