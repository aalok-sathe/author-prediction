see.
He
had
nestled
down
his
head
most
conveniently.
That's
very
like.
I
am
rather
proud
of
little
George.
The
corner
of
the
sofa
is
very
good.
Then
here
is
my
last,"
unclosing
a
pretty
sketch
of
a
gentleman
in
small
size,
whole
length
"my
last
and
my
best
my
brother,
Mr.
John
Knightley.
This
did
not
want
much
of
being
finished,
when
I
put
it
away
in
a
pet,
and
vowed
I
would
never
take
another
likeness.
I
could
not
help
being
provoked;
for
after
all
my
pains,
and
when
I
had
really
made
a
very
good
likeness
of
it
(Mrs.
Weston
and
I
were
quite
agreed
in
thinking
it
very
like)
only
too
handsome
too
flattering
but
that
was
a
fault
on
the
right
side"
after
all
this,
came
poor
dear
Isabella's
cold
approbation
of
"Yes,
it
was
a
little
like
but
to
be
sure
it
did
not
do
him
justice.
We
had
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
persuading
him
to
sit
at
all.
It
was
made
a
great
favour
of;
and
altogether
it
was
more
than
I
could
bear;
and
so
I
never
would
finish
it,
to
have
it
apologised
over
as
an
unfavourable
likeness,
