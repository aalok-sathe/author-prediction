dignity,
he
would
probably
feel
that
the
arguments,
which
to
Elizabeth
had
appeared
weak
and
ridiculous,
contained
much
good
sense
and
solid
reasoning.
If
he
had
been
wavering
before
as
to
what
he
should
do,
which
had
often
seemed
likely,
the
advice
and
entreaty
of
so
near
a
relation
might
settle
every
doubt,
and
determine
him
at
once
to
be
as
happy
as
dignity
unblemished
could
make
him.
In
that
case
he
would
return
no
more.
Lady
Catherine
might
see
him
in
her
way
through
town;
and
his
engagement
to
Bingley
of
coming
again
to
Netherfield
must
give
way.
"If,
therefore,
an
excuse
for
not
keeping
his
promise
should
come
to
his
friend
within
a
few
days,"
she
added,
"I
shall
know
how
to
understand
it.
I
shall
then
give
over
every
expectation,
every
wish
of
his
constancy.
If
he
is
satisfied
with
only
regretting
me,
when
he
might
have
obtained
my
affections
and
hand,
I
shall
soon
cease
to
regret
him
at
all."
The
surprise
of
the
rest
of
the
family,
on
hearing
who
their
visitor
had
been,
was
very
great;
but
they
obligingly
satisfied
it,
with
the
same
kind
of
supposition
which
had
appeased
Mrs.
Bennet's
curiosity;
and
