I
say,
sir,"
turning
to
Mr.
Woodhouse,
"I
think
there
are
few
places
with
such
society
as
Highbury.
I
always
say,
we
are
quite
blessed
in
our
neighbours.
My
dear
sir,
if
there
is
one
thing
my
mother
loves
better
than
another,

pork

roast
loin
of
pork

Miss

the
business

Miss
Campbell's
account
we
shall
not
excuse
your
being
indifferent
about
Mr.
Elton
and
Miss
Hawkins."
"When
I
have
seen
Mr.
Elton,"
replied
Jane,
"I
dare
say
I
shall
be
interested
but
I
believe
it
requires
that

me.
And
as

Miss
Campbell
married,
