days
indeed
have
rendered
a
gentleman's
carriage
perfectly
complete.
One
is
so
fenced
and
guarded
from
the
weather,
that
not
a
breath
of
air
can
find
its
way
unpermitted.
Weather
becomes
absolutely
of
no
consequence.
It
is
a
very
cold
afternoon
but
in
this
carriage
we
know
nothing
of
the
matter.
Ha!
snows
a
little
I
see."
"Yes,"
said
John
Knightley,
"and
I
think
we
shall
have
a
good
deal
of
it."
"Christmas
weather,"
observed
Mr.
Elton.
"Quite
seasonable;
and
extremely
fortunate
we
may
think
ourselves
that
it
did
not
begin
yesterday,
and
prevent
this
day's
party,
which
it
might
very
possibly
have
done,
for
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
hardly
have
ventured
had
there
been
much
snow
on
the
ground;
but
now
it
is
of
no
consequence.
This
is
quite
the
season
indeed
for
friendly
meetings.
At
Christmas
every
body
invites
their
friends
about
them,
and
people
think
little
of
even
the
worst
weather.
I
was
snowed
up
at
a
friend's
house
once
for
a
week.
Nothing
could
be
pleasanter.
I
went
for
only
one
night,
and
could
not
get
away
till
that
very
day
se'nnight."
Mr.
John
Knightley
looked
as
if
he
did
not
comprehend
the
pleasure,
but
said
only,
