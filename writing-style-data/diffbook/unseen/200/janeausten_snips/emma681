venture
to
declare,
that
Mr.
Knightley
is
the
last
man
in
the
world,
who
would
intentionally
give
any
woman
the
idea
of
his
feeling
for
her
more
than
he
really
does."
Harriet
seemed
ready
to
worship
her
friend
for
a
sentence
so
satisfactory;
and
Emma
was
only
saved
from
raptures
and
fondness,
which
at
that
moment
would
have
been
dreadful
penance,
by
the
sound
of
her
father's
footsteps.
He
was
coming
through
the
hall.
Harriet
was
too
much
agitated
to
encounter
him.
"She
could
not
compose

therefore,
she
passed
off
through
another
door
and
the
moment
she
was
gone,
this
was
the
spontaneous
burst
of
Emma's
feelings:
"Oh
God!
that
I
had
never
seen
her!"
The
rest
of
the
day,
the
following
night,
were
hardly
enough
for
her
thoughts.
She
was
bewildered
amidst
the
confusion
of
all
that
had
rushed
on
her
within
the
last
few
hours.
Every
moment
had
brought
a
fresh
surprize;
and
every
surprize
must
be
matter
of
humiliation
to
her.
How
to
understand
it
all!
How
to
understand
the
deceptions
she
had
been
thus
practising
on
herself,
and
living
