I
have
been
so
disappointed."
And
she
leaned
back
in
the
corner,
to
indulge
her
murmurs,
or
to
reason
them
away;
probably
a
little
of
both
such
being
the
commonest
process
of
a
not
ill
disposed
mind.
Presently
the
carriage
stopt;
she
looked
up;
it
was
stopt
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston,
who
were
standing
to
speak
to
her.
There
was
instant
pleasure
in
the
sight
of
them,
and
still
greater
pleasure
was
conveyed
in
sound
for
Mr.
Weston
immediately
accosted
her
with,
"How
d'ye
do?
how
d'ye
do?
We
have
been
sitting
with
your
father
glad
to
see
him
so
well.
Frank
comes
to
morrow
I
had
a
letter
this
morning
we
see
him
to
morrow
by
dinner
time
to
a
certainty
he
is
at
Oxford
to
day,
and
he
comes
for
a
whole
fortnight;
I
knew
it
would
be
so.
If
he
had
come
at
Christmas
he
could
not
have
staid
three
days;
I
was
always
glad
he
did
not
come
at
Christmas;
now
we
are
going
to
have
just
the
right
weather
for
him,
fine,
dry,
settled
weather.
We
shall
enjoy
him
completely;
every
thing
has
turned
out
exactly
as
we
could
wish."
There
was
no
resisting
