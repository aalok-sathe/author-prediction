The
next
was
in
these
words:
"I
do
not
pretend
to
regret
anything
I
shall
leave
in
Hertfordshire,
except
your
society,
my
dearest
friend;
but
we
will
hope,
at
some
future
period,
to
enjoy
many
returns
of
that
delightful
intercourse
we
have
known,
and
in
the
meanwhile
may
lessen
the
pain
of
separation
by
a
very
frequent
and
most
unreserved
correspondence.
I
depend
on
you
for
that."
To
these
highflown
expressions
Elizabeth
listened
with
all
the
insensibility
of
distrust;
and
though
the
suddenness
of
their
removal
surprised
her,
she
saw
nothing
in
it
really
to
lament;
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
their
absence
from
Netherfield
would
prevent
Mr.
Bingley's
being
there;
and
as
to
the
loss
of
their
society,
she
was
persuaded
that
Jane
must
cease
to
regard
it,
in
the
enjoyment
of
his.
"It
is
unlucky,"
said
she,
after
a
short
pause,
"that
you
should
not
be
able
to
see
your
friends
before
they
leave
the
country.
But
may
we
not
hope
that
the
period
of
future
happiness
to
which
Miss
Bingley
looks
forward
may
arrive
earlier
than
she
is
aware,
and
that
the
delightful
intercourse
you
have
known
as
friends
will
be
renewed
with
yet
greater
