could
wish
for.
When
the
Westons
arrived,
the
kindest
looks
of
love,
the
strongest
of
admiration
were
for
her,
from
both
husband
and
wife;
the
son
approached
her
with
a
cheerful
eagerness
which
marked
her
as
his
peculiar
object,
and
at
dinner
she
found
him
seated
by
her
and,
as
she
firmly
believed,
not
without
some
dexterity
on
his
side.
The
party
was
rather
large,
as
it
included
one
other
family,
a
proper
unobjectionable

and,
while
politics
and
Mr.
Elton
were
talked
over,
Emma
could
fairly
surrender
all
her
attention
to
the
pleasantness
of
her
neighbour.
The
first
remote
sound
to
which
she
felt
herself
obliged
to
attend,
was
the
name
of
Jane
Fairfax.
Mrs.
Cole
seemed
to
be
relating
something
of
her
that
was
expected
to
be
very
interesting.
She
listened,
and
found
it
well
worth
listening
to.
