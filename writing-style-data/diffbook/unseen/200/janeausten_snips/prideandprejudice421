forced
him
to
say
what
gave
no
one
any
pain
but
herself.
Mrs.
Gardiner
and
Elizabeth
talked
of
all
that
had
occurred
during
their
visit,
as
they
returned,
except
what
had
particularly
interested
them
both.
The
look
and
behaviour
of
everybody
they
had
seen
were
discussed,
except
of
the
person
who
had
mostly
engaged
their
attention.
They
talked
of
his
sister,
his
friends,

there;
but
on
the
third
her
repining
was
over,
and
her
sister
justified,
by
the
receipt
of
two
letters
from
her
at
once,
on
one
of
which
was
marked
that
it
had
been
missent
elsewhere.
Elizabeth
was
not
surprised
at
it,
as
Jane
had
written
the
direction
remarkably
ill.
They
had
just
