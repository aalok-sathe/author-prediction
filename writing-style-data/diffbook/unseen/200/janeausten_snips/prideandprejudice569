this
land.'
"Can
you
possibly
guess,
Lizzy,
who
is
meant
by
this?
'This
young
gentleman
is
blessed,
in
a
peculiar
way,
with
every
thing
the
heart
of
mortal
can
most
desire,
splendid
property,
noble
kindred,
and
extensive
patronage.
Yet
in
spite
of
all
these
temptations,
let
me
warn
my
cousin
Elizabeth,
and
yourself,
of
what
evils
you
may
incur
by
a
precipitate
closure
with
this
gentleman's
proposals,
which,
of
course,
you
will
be
inclined
to
take
immediate
advantage
of.'
"Have
you
any
idea,
Lizzy,
who
this
gentleman
is?
But
now
it
comes
out:
"'My
motive
for
cautioning
you
is
as

his
aunt,
Lady
Catherine

does
not
look
on
the
match
with
a
friendly
eye.'
"Mr.
Darcy,
you
see,
is
the
man!
Now,
Lizzy,
I
think
I
have
surprised
you.
Could
he,
or
the
Lucases,
have
pitched
on
any
man
within
the
circle
of
our
acquaintance,
whose
name
would
have
given
the
lie
more
effectually
to
what
they
related?
Mr.
Darcy,
who
never
looks
at
any
woman
but
to
see
a
blemish,
and
who
probably
never
looked
at
you
in
his
life!
It
is
admirable!"
Elizabeth
tried
to
join
in
her
father's
