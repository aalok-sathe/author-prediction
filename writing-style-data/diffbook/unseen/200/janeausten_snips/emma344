the
noise."
"But,
my
dear
sir,"
cried
Mr.
Weston,
"if
Emma
comes
away
early,
it
will
be
breaking
up
the
party."
"And
no
great
harm
if
it
does,"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse.
"The
sooner
every
party
breaks
up,
the
better."
"But
you

years."
"No,

account
in
the
world,
Mr.
Weston;
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
reminding
me.
I
should
be
