told
the
girls
what
an
honour
they
might
expect,
adding:
"I
may
thank
you,
Eliza,
for
this
piece
of
civility.
Mr.
Darcy
would
never
have
come
so
soon
to
wait
upon
me."
Elizabeth
had
scarcely
time
to
disclaim
all
right
to
the
compliment,
before
their
approach
was
announced
by
the
door
bell,
and
shortly
afterwards
the
three
gentlemen
entered
the
room.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam,
who
led
the
way,
was
about
thirty,
not
handsome,
but
in
person
and
address
most
truly
the
gentleman.
Mr.
Darcy
looked
just
as
he
had
been
used
to
look
in
Hertfordshire
paid
his
compliments,
with
his
usual
reserve,
to
Mrs.
Collins,
and
whatever
might
be
his
feelings
toward
her
friend,
met
her
with
every
appearance
of
composure.
Elizabeth
merely
curtseyed
to
him
without
saying
a
word.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
entered
into
conversation
directly
with
the
readiness
and
ease
of
a
well
bred
man,
and
talked
very
pleasantly;
but
his
cousin,
after
having
addressed
a
slight
observation
on
the
house
and
garden
to
Mrs.
Collins,
sat
for
some
time
without
speaking
to
anybody.
At
length,
however,
his
civility
was
so
far
awakened
as
to
inquire
of
Elizabeth
after
the
health
of
her
family.
She
answered
him
in
the
usual
