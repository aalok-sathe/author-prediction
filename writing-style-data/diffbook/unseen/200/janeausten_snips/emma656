be
attached
to
him
nay,
was
attached
and
how
it
came
to
cease,
is
perhaps
the
wonder.
Fortunately,
however,
it
did
cease.
I
have
really
for
some
time
past,
for
at
least
these
three
months,
cared
nothing
about
him.
You
may
believe
me,
Mrs.
Weston.
This
is
the
simple
truth."
Mrs.
Weston
kissed
her
with
tears
of
joy;
and
when
she

find
utterance,
assured
her,

on
your
account."
"I
have

and
that
I
should
escape,
may
be
a
matter
of
grateful
wonder
to
you
and
myself.
But
this
does
not
acquit
him,
Mrs.
Weston;
and
I
must
say,
that
I
think
him
greatly
to
blame.
What
right
had
he
to
come
among
us
with
affection
and
faith

and
with
manners
so
very
disengaged?
What
right
had
he
