was
not
exactly
what
she
had
expected;
less
of
the
man
of
the
world
in
some
of
his
notions,
less
of
the
spoiled
child
of
fortune,
therefore
better
than
she
had
expected.
His
ideas
seemed
more
moderate
his
feelings
warmer.
She
was
particularly
struck
by
his
manner
of
considering
Mr.
Elton's
house,
which,
as
well
as
the
church,
he
would
go
and

The

must
be
a
blockhead
who
wanted
more.
Mrs.
Weston
laughed,
and
said
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
talking
about.
Used
only
to
a
large
house
himself,
and
without
ever
thinking
how
many
advantages
and
accommodations
were
attached
to
its
size,
he
could
be
no
judge
of
the
privations
inevitably
belonging
to
a
small
one.
But
Emma,
in
her
own
mind,
determined
that
