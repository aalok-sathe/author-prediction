aimed
at
wounding
more
than
Harriet,"
said
he.
"Emma,
why
is
it
that
they
are
your
enemies?"
He
looked
with
smiling
penetration;
and,
on
receiving
no
answer,
added,
"She
ought
not
to
be
angry
with
you,
I
suspect,
whatever
he
may
be.
To
that
surmise,
you
say
nothing,
of
course;
but
confess,
Emma,
that
you
did
want
him
to
marry
Harriet."
"I
did,"
replied
Emma,
"and
they
cannot
forgive
me."
He
shook
his
head;
but
there
was
a
smile
of
indulgence
with
it,
and
he
only
said,
"I
shall
not
scold
you.
I
leave

own
reflections."
"Can
you
trust

with
such
flatterers?
Does
my
vain
spirit
ever
tell
me
I
am
wrong?"
"Not
your
vain
spirit,
but
your
serious
spirit.
If
one
leads
you
wrong,
I
am
sure
the
other
tells
you
of
it."
"I
do
own
myself
to
have
been
completely
mistaken
in
Mr.
Elton.
There
is
a
littleness
about
him
which
you
discovered,
and
which
I
did
not:
and
I
was
fully
convinced
of
his
being
in
love
with
Harriet.
It
was
through
a
series
of
strange
blunders!"
"And,
in
return
for
your
acknowledging
so
much,
I
will
do
you
the
justice
to
say,
