Yes,
I
immediately
perceive
that
it
must
be
the
joint
present
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Dixon.
We
were
speaking
the
other
day,
you
know,
of
his
being
so
warm
an
admirer
of
her
performance."
"Yes,
and
what
you
told
me
on
that
head,
confirmed
an
idea
which
I
had
entertained
before.
I
do
not
mean
to
reflect
upon
the
good
intentions
of
either
Mr.
Dixon
or
Miss
Fairfax,
but
I
cannot
help
suspecting
either
that,
after
making
his
proposals
to
her
friend,
he
had
the
misfortune
to
fall
in
love
with
her,
or
that
he
became
conscious
of
a
little
attachment
on
her
side.
One
might
guess
twenty
things
without
guessing
exactly
the
right;
but
I
am
sure
there
must
be
a
particular
cause
for
her
chusing
to
come
to
Highbury
instead
of
going
with
the
Campbells
to
Ireland.
Here,
she
must
be
leading
a
life
of
privation
and
penance;
there
it
would
have
been
all
enjoyment.
As
to
the
pretence
of
trying
her
native
air,
I
look
upon
that
as
a
mere
excuse.
In
the
summer
it
might
have
passed;
but
what
can
any
body's
native
air
do
for
them
in
the
months
of
January,
February,
and
March?
Good
