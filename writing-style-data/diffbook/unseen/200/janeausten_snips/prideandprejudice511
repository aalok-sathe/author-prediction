he
was
reduced
to
meet,
frequently
meet,
reason
with,
persuade,
and
finally
bribe,
the
man
whom
he
always
most
wished
to
avoid,
and
whose
very
name
it
was
punishment
to
him
to
pronounce.
He
had
done
all
this
for
a
girl
whom
he
could
neither
regard
nor
esteem.
Her
heart
did
whisper
that
he
had
done
it
for
her.
But
it
was
a
hope
shortly
checked
by
other
considerations,
and
she
soon
felt
that
even
her
vanity
was
insufficient,
when
required
to
depend
on
his
affection
for
her
for
a
woman
who
had
already
refused
him
as
able
to
overcome
a
sentiment
so
natural
as
abhorrence
against
relationship
with
Wickham.
Brother
in
law
of
Wickham!
Every
kind
of
pride
must
revolt
from
the
connection.
He
had,
to
be
sure,
done
much.
She
was
ashamed
to
think
how
much.
But
he
had
given
a
reason
for
his
interference,
which
asked
no
extraordinary
stretch
of
belief.
It
was
reasonable
that
he
should
feel
he
had
been
wrong;
he
had
liberality,
and
he
had
the
means
of
exercising
it;
and
though
she
would
not
place
herself
as
his
principal
inducement,
she
could,
perhaps,
believe
that
remaining
partiality
for
her
might
assist
his
endeavours
