valuable.
They
walked
on,
without
knowing
in
what
direction.
There
was
too
much
to
be
thought,
and
felt,
and
said,
for
attention
to
any
other
objects.
She
soon
learnt
that
they
were
indebted
for
their
present
good
understanding
to
the
efforts
of
his
aunt,
who
did
call
on
him
in
her
return
through
London,
and
there
relate
her
journey
to
Longbourn,
its
motive,
and
the
substance
of
her
conversation
with
Elizabeth;
dwelling
emphatically
on
every

of
the
latter

he,
"as
I
had
scarcely
ever
allowed
myself
to
hope
before.
I
knew
enough
of
your
disposition
to
be
certain
that,
had
you
been
absolutely,
irrevocably
decided
against
me,
you
would
have
acknowledged
it
to
Lady
Catherine,
frankly
and
openly."
Elizabeth
coloured
and
laughed
as
she
replied,
"Yes,
you
know
enough
of
my
frankness
to
believe
me
capable
of
that.
After
abusing
