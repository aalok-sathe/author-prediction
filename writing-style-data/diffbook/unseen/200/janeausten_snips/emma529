No
rain
at
all.
Nothing
to
signify.
I
do
not
care
for
myself.
Quite
thick
shoes.
And
Jane
declares
Well!
(as
soon
as
she
was
within
the
door)
Well!
This
is
brilliant
indeed!
This
is
admirable!
Excellently
contrived,
upon
my
word.
Nothing
wanting.
Could
not
have
imagined
it.
So
well
lighted
up!
Jane,
Jane,
look!
did
you
ever
see
any
thing?
Oh!
Mr.
Weston,
you
must
really
have
had
Aladdin's
lamp.
Good
Mrs.
Stokes
would
not
know
her
own
room
again.
I
saw
her
as
I
came
in;
she
was
standing
in
the
entrance.
'Oh!
Mrs.
Stokes,'
said
I
but
I
had
not
time
for
more."
She
was
now
met
by
Mrs.
Weston.
"Very
well,
I
thank
you,
ma'am.
I
hope
you
are
quite
well.
Very
happy
to
hear
it.
So
afraid
you
might
have
a
headache!
seeing
you
pass
by
so
often,
and
knowing
how
much
trouble
you
must
have.
Delighted
to
hear
it
indeed.
Ah!
dear
Mrs.
Elton,
so
obliged
to
you
for
the
carriage!
excellent
time.
Jane
and
I
quite
ready.
Did
not
keep
the
horses
a
moment.
Most
comfortable
carriage.
Oh!
and
I
am
sure
our
thanks
are
due
to
you,
Mrs.
Weston,
on
that
score.
