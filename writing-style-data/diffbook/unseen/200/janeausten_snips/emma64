with
regard
to
him.
He
talked
of
Harriet,
and
praised
her
so
warmly,
that
she
could
not
suppose
any
thing
wanting
which
a
little
time
would
not
add.
His
perception
of
the
striking
improvement
of
Harriet's
manner,
since
her
introduction
at
Hartfield,
was
not
one
of
the
least
agreeable
proofs
of
his
growing
attachment.
"You
have
given
Miss
Smith
all
that
she
required,"
said
he;
"you
have
made
her
graceful
and
easy.
She
was
a
beautiful
creature
when
she
came
to
you,
but,
in
my
opinion,
the
attractions
you
have
added
are
infinitely
superior
to
what
she
received
from
nature."
"I
am
glad
you
think
I
have
been
useful
to
her;
but
Harriet
only
wanted
drawing
out,
and
receiving
a
few,
very
few
hints.
She
had
all
the
natural
grace
of
sweetness
of
temper
and
artlessness
in
herself.
I
have
done
very
little."
"If
it
were
admissible
to
contradict
a
lady,"
said
the
gallant
Mr.
Elton
"I
have
perhaps
given
her
a
little
more
decision
of
character,
have
taught
her
to
think
on
points
which
had
not
fallen
in
her
way
before."
"Exactly
so;
that
is
what
principally
strikes
me.
So
much
superadded
decision
of
character!
Skilful
has
been
the
