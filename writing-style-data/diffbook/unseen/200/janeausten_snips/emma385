is
no
reason
to
suppose
the
instrument
is
indifferent.
Quite
otherwise
indeed,
if
I
understood
Miss
Fairfax's
opinion
last
night."
"Do
come
with
me,"
said
Mrs.
Weston,
"if
it
be
not
very
disagreeable
to
you.
It
need
not
detain
us
long.
We
will

Hartfield.

settled,
even
to
the
destination
of
the
parcel.
"Should
I

Mrs.
Goddard's,

asked
Mrs.
Ford.
"Yes

Goddard's.
Only
