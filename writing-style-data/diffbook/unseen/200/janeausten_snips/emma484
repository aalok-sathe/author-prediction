Woodhouse,
who
being,
according
to
his
custom
on
such
occasions,
making
the
circle
of
his
guests,
and
paying
his
particular
compliments
to
the
ladies,
was
ending
with
her
and
with
all
his
mildest
urbanity,
said,
"I
am
very
sorry
to
hear,
Miss
Fairfax,
of
your
being
out
this
morning
in
the
rain.
Young
ladies
should
take
care
of
themselves.
Young
ladies
are
delicate
plants.
They
should
take
care
of
their
health
and
their
complexion.
My
dear,
did
you
change
your
stockings?"
"Yes,
sir,
I
did
indeed;
and
I
am
very
much
obliged
by
your
kind
solicitude
about
me."
"My
dear
Miss
Fairfax,
young
ladies
are
very
sure
to
be
cared
for.
I
hope
your
good
grand
mama
and
aunt
are
well.
They
are
some
of
my
very
old
friends.
I
wish
my
health
allowed
me
to
be
a
better
neighbour.
You
do
us
a
great
deal
of
honour
to
day,
I
am
sure.
My
daughter
and
I
are
both
highly
sensible
of
your
goodness,
and
have
the
greatest
satisfaction
in
seeing
you
at
Hartfield."
The
kind
hearted,
polite
old
man
might
then
sit
down
and
feel
that
he
had
done
his
duty,
and
made
every
fair
lady
welcome
and
easy.
