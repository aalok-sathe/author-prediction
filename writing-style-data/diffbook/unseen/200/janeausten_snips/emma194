think
of
it,
she
was
very
strongly
persuaded;
and
though
not
meaning
to
be
induced
by
him,
or
by
any
body
else,
to
give
up
a
situation
which
she
believed
more
replete
with
good
than
any
she
could
change
it
for,
she
had
a
great
curiosity
to
see
him,
a
decided
intention
of
finding
him
pleasant,
of
being
liked
by
him
to
a
certain
degree,
and
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
the
idea
of
their
being
coupled
in
their
friends'
imaginations.
With
such
sensations,
Mr.
Elton's
civilities
were
dreadfully
ill
timed;
but
she
had
the
comfort
of
appearing
very
polite,
while
feeling
very
cross
and
of
thinking
that
the
rest
of
the
visit
could
not
possibly
pass
without
bringing
forward
the
same
information
again,
or
the
substance
of
it,
from
the
open
hearted
Mr.
Weston.
So
it
proved;
for
when
happily
released
from
Mr.
Elton,
and
seated
by
Mr.
Weston,
at
dinner,
he
made
use
of
the
very
first
interval
in
the
cares
of
hospitality,
the
very
first
leisure
from
the
saddle
of
mutton,
to
say
to
her,
"We
want
only
two
more
to
be
just
the
right
number.
I
should
like
to
see
two
more
here,
your
pretty
little
