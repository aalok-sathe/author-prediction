to
do
any
thing
I
wished."
"There
is
hardly
any
desiring
to
refresh
such
a
memory
as
that,"
said
Mr.
Knightley,
feelingly;
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
had
done.
"But
I,"
he
soon
added,
"who
have
had
no
such
charm
thrown
over
my
senses,
must
still
see,
hear,
and
remember.
Emma
is
spoiled
by
being
the
cleverest
of
her
family.
At
ten

talents,
and
must

under
subjection
to
her."
"I
should
have
been
sorry,
Mr.
Knightley,
to
be
dependent
on
your
recommendation,
had
I
quitted
Mr.
Woodhouse's
family
and
wanted
another
situation;
I
do
not
think
you
would
have
spoken
a
good
word
for
me
to
any
body.
I
am
sure
you
always
thought
me
unfit
for
the
office
I
held."
"Yes,"
said
he,
smiling.
"You
are
better
placed
here;
very
fit
for
