unadorned
as
it
was
by
any
such
broad
wreath
of
gallantry,
she
yet
could
discern
the
effect
of
her
influence
and
acknowledge
the
greatest
compliment
perhaps
of
all
conveyed.
Compressed
into
the
very
lowest
vacant
corner
were
these
words
"I
had
not
a
spare
moment
on
Tuesday,
as
you
know,
for
Miss
Woodhouse's
beautiful
little
friend.
Pray
make
my
excuses
and
adieus
to
her."
This,
Emma
could
not
doubt,
was
all
for
herself.
Harriet
was
remembered
only
from
being
her
friend.
His
information
and
prospects
as
to
Enscombe
were
neither
worse
nor
better
than
had
been
anticipated;
Mrs.
Churchill
was
recovering,
and
he
dared
not
yet,
even
in
his
own
imagination,
fix
a
time
for
coming
to
Randalls
again.
Gratifying,
however,
and
stimulative
as
was
the
letter
in
the
material
part,
its
sentiments,
she
yet
found,
when
it
was
folded
up
and
returned
to
Mrs.
Weston,
that
it
had
not
added
any
lasting
warmth,
that
she
could
still
do
without
the
writer,
and
that
he
must
learn
to
do
without
her.
Her
intentions
were
unchanged.
Her
resolution
of
refusal
only
grew
more
interesting
by
the
addition
of
a
scheme
for
his
subsequent
consolation
and
happiness.

recollection

Harriet,
