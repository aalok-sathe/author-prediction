walked
off,
followed
in
half
a
minute
by
Mr.
Knightley.
Mr.
Weston,
his
son,
Emma,
and
Harriet,
only
remained;
and
the
young
man's
spirits
now
rose
to
a
pitch
almost
unpleasant.
Even
Emma
grew
tired
at
last
of
flattery
and
merriment,
and
wished
herself
rather
walking
quietly
about
with
any
of
the
others,
or
sitting
almost
alone,
and
quite
unattended
to,
in
tranquil
observation
of
the
beautiful
views
beneath
her.
The
appearance
of
the
servants
looking
out
for
them
to
give
notice
of
the
carriages
was
a
joyful
sight;
and
even
the
bustle
of
collecting
and
preparing
to
depart,
and
the
solicitude
of
Mrs.
Elton
to
have
her
carriage
first,
were
gladly
endured,
in
the
prospect
of
the
quiet
drive
home
which
was
to
close
the
very
questionable
enjoyments
of
this
day
of
pleasure.
Such
another
scheme,
composed
of
so
many
ill
assorted
people,
she
hoped
never
to
be
betrayed
into
again.
While
waiting
for
the
carriage,
she
found
Mr.
Knightley
by
her
side.
He
looked
around,
as
if
to
see
that
no
one
were
near,
and
then
said,
"Emma,
I
must
once
more
speak
to
you
as
I
have
been
used
to
do:
a
privilege
rather
endured
than
allowed,
