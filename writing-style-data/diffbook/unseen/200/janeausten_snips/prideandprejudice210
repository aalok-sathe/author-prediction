merit,
and
threw
back
the
praise
on
her
sister's
warm
affection.
"Nay,"
said
Elizabeth,
"this
is
not
fair.
You
wish
to
think
all
the
world
respectable,
and
are
hurt
if
I
speak
ill
of
anybody.
I
only
want
to
think
you
perfect,
and
you
set
yourself
against
it.
Do

the
other
is
Charlotte's
marriage.
It
is
unaccountable!
In
every
view
it
is
unaccountable!"
"My
dear
Lizzy,
do
not
give
way
to
such
feelings
as
these.
They
will
ruin
your
happiness.
You
do
not
make
allowance
enough
for
