truth,
and
I
then
fancied
she
was
not
without
suspicion;
but
I
have
no
doubt
of
her
having
since
detected
me,
at
least
in
some
degree.
She
may
not
have
surmised
the
whole,
but
her
quickness
must
have
penetrated
a
part.
I
cannot
doubt
it.
You
will
find,
whenever
the
subject
becomes
freed
from
its
present
restraints,
that
it
did
not
take
her
wholly
by
surprize.
She
frequently
gave
me
hints
of
it.
I
remember
her
telling
me
at
the
ball,
that
I
owed
Mrs.
Elton
gratitude

her
attentions
to
Miss

I

of
my
conduct
towards
her
will
be
admitted
by
you
and
my
father
as
great
extenuation
of
what
you
saw
amiss.
While
you
considered
me
as
having

Emma
Woodhouse,
I
could
deserve
nothing
from
either.
Acquit

here,
and
procure
for
me,
when
it
is
allowable,
the
acquittal
and
good
wishes
of
that
said
Emma
Woodhouse,
whom
I
regard
with
so
much
brotherly
affection,
as
to
long
to
have
her
as
deeply
and
as
happily
in
love
as
myself.
Whatever
strange
things
I
said
or
did
during
that
fortnight,
you
have
now
a
key
to.
