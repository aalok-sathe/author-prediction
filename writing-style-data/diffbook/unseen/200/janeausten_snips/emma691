to
defer
this
ceremonious
call
till
a
little
time
had
passed,
and
Mr.
Churchill
could
be
reconciled
to
the
engagement's
becoming
known;
as,
considering
every
thing,
she
thought
such
a
visit
could
not
be
paid
without
leading
to
reports:
but
Mr.
Weston
had
thought
differently;
he
was
extremely
anxious
to
shew
his
approbation
to
Miss
Fairfax
and
her
family,
and
did
not
conceive
that
any
suspicion
could
be
excited
by
it;
or
if
it
were,
that
it
would
be
of
any
consequence;
for
"such
things,"
he
observed,
"always
got
about."
Emma
smiled,
and
felt
that
Mr.
Weston
had
very
good
reason
for
saying
so.
They
had
gone,
in
short
and
very
great
had
been
the
evident
distress
and
confusion
of
the
lady.
She
had
hardly
been
able
to
speak
a
word,
and
every
look
and
action
had
shewn
how
deeply
she
was
suffering
from
consciousness.
The
quiet,
heart
felt
satisfaction
of
the
old
lady,
and
the
rapturous
delight
of
her
daughter
who
proved
even
too
joyous
to
talk
as
usual,
had
been
a
gratifying,
yet
almost
an
affecting,
scene.
They
were
both
so
truly
respectable
in
their
happiness,
so
disinterested
in
every
sensation;
thought
so
much
of
Jane;
so
much
