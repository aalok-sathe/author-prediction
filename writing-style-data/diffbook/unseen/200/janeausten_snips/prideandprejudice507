either
the
gentleman
or
lady
concerned
in
it
deserved.
But
at
last
your
uncle
was
forced
to
yield,
and
instead
of
being
allowed
to
be
of
use
to
his
niece,
was
forced
to
put
up
with
only
having
the
probable
credit
of
it,
which
went
sorely
against
the
grain;
and
I
really
believe
your
letter
this
morning
gave
him
great
pleasure,
because
it
required
an
explanation
that
would
rob
him
of
his
borrowed
feathers,
and
give
the
praise
where
it
was
due.
But,
Lizzy,
this
must
go
no
farther
than
yourself,
or
Jane
at
most.
"You
know
pretty
well,
I
suppose,
what
has
been
done
for
the
young
people.
His
debts
are
to
be
paid,
amounting,
I
believe,
to
considerably
more
than
a
thousand
pounds,
another
thousand
in
addition
to
her
own
settled
upon
her,
and
his
commission
purchased.
The
reason
why
all
this
was
to
be
done
by
him
alone,
was
such
as
I
have
given
above.
It
was
owing
to
him,
to
his
reserve
and
want
of
proper
consideration,
that
Wickham's
character
had
been
so
misunderstood,
and
consequently
that
he
had
been
received
and
noticed
as
he
was.
Perhaps
there
was
some
truth
in
this;
though
I
doubt
