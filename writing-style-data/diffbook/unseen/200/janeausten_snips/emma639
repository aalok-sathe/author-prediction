now
he
seemed
more
sudden
than
usual
in
his
disappearance.
Emma
could
not
regret
her
having
gone
to
Miss
Bates,
but
she
wished
she
had
left
her
ten
minutes
earlier;
it
would
have
been
a
great
pleasure
to
talk
over
Jane
Fairfax's
situation
with
Mr.
Knightley.
Neither
would
she
regret
that
he
should
be
going
to
Brunswick
Square,
for
she
knew
how
much
his
visit
would
be
enjoyed
but
it
might
have
happened
at
a
better
time
and
to
have
had
longer
notice
of
it,
would
have
been
pleasanter.
They
parted
thorough
friends,
however;
she
could
not
be
deceived
as
to
the
meaning
of
his
countenance,
and
his
unfinished
gallantry;
it
was
all
done
to
assure
her
that
she
had
fully
recovered
his
good
opinion.
He
had
been
sitting
with
them
half
an
hour,
she
found.
It
was
a
pity
that
she
had
not
come
back
earlier!
In
the
hope
of
diverting
her
father's
thoughts
from
the
disagreeableness
of
Mr.
Knightley's
going
to
London;
and
going
so
suddenly;
and
going
on
horseback,
which
she
knew
would
be
all
very
bad;
Emma
communicated
her
news
of
Jane
Fairfax,
and
her
dependence
on
the
effect
was
justified;
it
supplied
a
very
useful
