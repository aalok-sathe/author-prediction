a
low
phaeton
at
the
garden
gate.
"And
is
this
all?"
cried
Elizabeth.
"I
expected
at
least
that
the
pigs
were
got
into
the
garden,
and
here
is
nothing
but
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter."
"La!
my
dear,"
said
Maria,
quite
shocked
at
the
mistake,
"it
is
not
Lady
Catherine.
The
old
lady
is
Mrs.
Jenkinson,
who
lives
with
them;
the
other
is
Miss
de
Bourgh.
Only
look
at
her.
She
is
quite
a
little
creature.
Who
would
have
thought
that
she
could

so
thin
and
small?"
"She
is
abominably

to
keep
Charlotte
out
of

in
all

Why
does
she
not
come

"Oh,
Charlotte
says
she
hardly
ever
does.
It
is
the
greatest
of
favours
when
Miss
de
Bourgh
comes
in."
"I
like
her
appearance,"
said
Elizabeth,
struck
with
other
ideas.
"She
looks
sickly
and
cross.
Yes,
she
will
do
for
him
very
well.
She
will
make
him
a
very
proper
wife."
Mr.
Collins
and
Charlotte
were
both
standing
at
the
gate
in
conversation
with
the
ladies;
and
Sir
William,
to
Elizabeth's
high
diversion,
was
stationed
in
the
doorway,
in
earnest
contemplation
of
the
greatness
before
him,
and
constantly
bowing
whenever
Miss
de
Bourgh
