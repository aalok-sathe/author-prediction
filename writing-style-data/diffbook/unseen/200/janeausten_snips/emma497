be
done
till
the
summer.
For
two
or
three
months
longer
I
shall
remain
where
I
am,
and
as
I
am."
"And
I
am
quite
serious
too,
I
assure
you,"
replied
Mrs.
Elton
gaily,
"in
resolving
to
be
always
on
the
watch,
and
employing
my
friends
to
watch
also,
that
nothing
really
unexceptionable
may
pass
us."
In
this
style
she
ran
on;
never
thoroughly
stopped
by
any
thing
till
Mr.
Woodhouse
came
into
the
room;
her
vanity
had
then
a
change
of
object,
and
Emma
heard
her
saying
in
the
same
half
whisper
to
Jane,
"Here
comes
this
dear
old
beau
of
mine,
I
protest!
Only
think
of
his
gallantry
in
coming
away
before
the
other
men!
what
a
dear
creature
he
is;
I
assure
you
I
like
him
excessively.
I
admire
all
that
quaint,
old
fashioned
politeness;
it
is
much
more
to
my
taste
than
modern
ease;
modern
ease
often
disgusts
me.
But
this
good
old
Mr.
Woodhouse,
I
wish
you
had
heard
his
gallant
speeches
to
me
at
dinner.
Oh!
I
assure
you
I
began
to
think
my
caro
sposo
would
be
absolutely
jealous.
I
fancy
I
am
rather
a
favourite;
he
took
notice
of
my
gown.
