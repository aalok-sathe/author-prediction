the
sofa
for
a
week
together.
In
Frank's
last
letter
she
complained,
he
said,
of
being
too
weak
to
get
into
her
conservatory
without
having
both
his
arm
and
his
uncle's!
This,
you
know,
speaks
a
great
degree
of
weakness
but
now
she
is
so
impatient
to
be
in
town,
that
she
means
to
sleep
only
two
nights
on
the
road.
So
Frank
writes
word.
Certainly,
delicate
ladies
have
very
extraordinary
constitutions,
Mrs.
Elton.
You
must
grant
me
that."
"No,
indeed,
I
shall
grant
you
nothing.
I
always
take
the
part
of
my
own
sex.
I
do
indeed.
I
give
you
notice
You
will
find
me
a
formidable
antagonist
on
that
point.
I
always
stand
up
for
women
and
I
assure
you,
if
you
knew
how
Selina
feels
with
respect
to
sleeping
at
an
inn,
you
would
not
wonder
at
Mrs.
Churchill's
making
incredible
exertions
to
avoid
it.
Selina
says
it
is
quite
horror
to
her
and
I
believe
I
have
caught
a
little
of
her
nicety.
She
always
travels
with
her
own
sheets;
an
excellent
precaution.
Does
Mrs.
Churchill
do
the
same?"
"Depend
upon
it,
Mrs.
Churchill
does
every
thing
that
any
other
fine
lady
ever
did.
Mrs.
Churchill
