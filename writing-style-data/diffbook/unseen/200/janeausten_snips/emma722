the
slightest
inclination
for
thinking
of
any
body
else,
when
a
letter
was
brought
her
from
Randalls
a
very
thick
letter;
she
guessed
what
it
must
contain,
and
deprecated
the
necessity
of
reading
it.
She
was
now
in
perfect
charity
with
Frank
Churchill;
she
wanted
no
explanations,

we
shall
never
materially
disagree
about
the
writer
again;
but
I
will
not
delay
you
by
a
long
preface.
We
are
quite
well.
This
letter
has
been
the
cure
of
all
the
little
nervousness
I
have
been
feeling
lately.
I
did
not
quite
like
your
looks
on
Tuesday,
but
it
was
an
ungenial
morning;
