I

"I
know
you
do;
and
it
is
that
which
makes
the
wonder.
With
your
good
sense,
to
be
so
honestly
blind
to
the
follies
and
nonsense
of
others!
Affectation
of
candour
is
common
enough
one
meets
with
it
everywhere.
But
to
be
candid
without
ostentation
or

mistaken
if
we
shall

find
a
very
charming
neighbour
in
her."
Elizabeth

in
silence,
but
was
not
convinced;
their
behaviour
at
the
assembly
had
not
been
calculated
to
please
in
general;
and
with
more
quickness
of
observation
and
less
pliancy
of
temper
than
her
sister,
and
with
a
judgement
too
unassailed
by
any
attention
to
herself,
she
was
very
little
disposed
to
approve
them.
They
were
in
fact
very
fine
ladies;
not
deficient
in
good
humour
