obliged
to
turn
from
him
for
a
few
minutes,
and
listen
to
Mr.
Cole.
When
Mr.
Cole
had
moved
away,
and
her
attention
could
be
restored
as
before,
she
saw
Frank
Churchill
looking
intently
across
the
room
at
Miss
Fairfax,
who
was
sitting
exactly
opposite.
"What
is
the
matter?"
said
she.
He
started.
"Thank
you
for
rousing
me,"
he
replied.
"I
believe
I
have
been
very
rude;
but
really
Miss
Fairfax
has
done
her
hair
in
so
odd
a
way
so
very
odd
a
way
that
I
cannot
keep
my
eyes
from
her.
I
never
saw
any
thing
so
outree!
Those
curls!
This
must
be
a
fancy
of
her
own.
I
see
nobody
else
looking
like
her!
I
must
go
and
ask
her
whether
it
is
an
Irish
fashion.
Shall
I?
Yes,
I
will
I
declare
I
will
and
you
shall
see
how
she
takes
it;
whether
she
colours."
He
was
gone
immediately;
and
Emma
soon
saw
him
standing
before
Miss
Fairfax,
and
talking
to
her;
but
as
to
its
effect
on
the
young
lady,
as
he
had
improvidently
placed
himself
exactly
between
them,
exactly
in
front
of
Miss
Fairfax,
she
could
absolutely
distinguish
nothing.
Before
he
could
return
to
