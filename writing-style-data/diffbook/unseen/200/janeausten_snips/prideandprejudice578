idea
of
their
being
ever
felt
in
such
a
way."
"I
can
easily
believe
it.
You
thought
me
then
devoid
of
every
proper
feeling,
I
am
sure
you
did.
The
turn
of
your
countenance
I
shall
never
forget,
as
you
said
that
I
could
not

you
in
any
possible

you
to

I

letter.
There
was
one
part

having

power
of
reading
again.

can
remember

expressions
which
might
justly

letter
shall
certainly
be
burnt,
