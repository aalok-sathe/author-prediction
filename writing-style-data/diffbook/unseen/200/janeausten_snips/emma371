he
would
only
talk
louder,
and
drown
her
voice.
But
the
question
is
not,
whether
it
would
be
a
bad
connexion
for
him,
but
whether
he
wishes
it;
and
I
think
he
does.
I
have
heard
him
speak,
and
so
must
you,
so
very
highly
of
Jane
Fairfax!
The
interest
he
takes
in
her
his
anxiety
about
her
health
his
concern
that
she
should
have
no
happier
prospect!
I
have
heard
him
express
himself
so
warmly
on
those
points!
Such
an
admirer
of
her
performance
on
the
pianoforte,
and
of
her
voice!
I
have
heard
him
say
that
he
could
listen
to
her
for
ever.
Oh!
and
I
had
almost
forgotten
one
idea
that
occurred
to
me
this
pianoforte
that
has
been
sent
here
by
somebody
though
we
have
all
been
so
well
satisfied
to
consider
it
a
present
from
the
Campbells,
may
it
not
be
from
Mr.
Knightley?
I
cannot
help
suspecting
him.
I
think
he
is
just
the
person
to
do
it,
even
without
being
in
love."
"Then
it
can
be
no
argument
to
prove
that
he
is
in
love.
But
I
do
not
think
it
is
at
all
a
likely
thing
for
him
to
do.
Mr.
Knightley
