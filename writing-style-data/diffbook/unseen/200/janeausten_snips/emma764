and
artificial!
I
had
always
a
part
to
act.
It
was
a
life
of
deceit!
I
know
that
I
must
have
disgusted
you."
"Pray
say
no
more.
I
feel
that
all
the
apologies
should
be
on
my
side.
Let
us
forgive
each
other
at
once.
We
must
do
whatever
is
to
be
done
quickest,
and
I
think
our
feelings
will
lose
no
time
there.
I
hope
you
have
pleasant
accounts
from
Windsor?"
"Very."
"And
the
next
news,
I
suppose,
will
be,
that
we
are
to
lose
you
just
as
I
begin
to
know
you."
"Oh!
as
to
all
that,
of
course
nothing
can
be
thought
of
yet.
I
am
here
till
claimed
by
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell."
"Nothing
can
be
actually
settled
yet,
perhaps,"
replied
Emma,
smiling
"but,
excuse
me,
it
must
be
thought
of."
The
smile
was
returned
as
Jane
answered,
"You
are
very
right;
it
has
been
thought
of.
And
I
will
own
to
you,
(I
am
sure
it
will
be
safe),
that
so
far
as
our
living
with
Mr.
Churchill
at
Enscombe,
it
is
settled.
There
must
be
three
months,
at
least,
of
deep
mourning;
but
when
they
are
over,
I
imagine
there
will
be
nothing
more
