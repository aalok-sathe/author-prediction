do
not
at
all
blame
them;
of
course
she
heard
every
thing
he
might
be
telling
Miss
Campbell
about
his
own
home
in
Ireland;
and
I
think
she
wrote
us
word
that
he
had
shewn
them
some
drawings
of
the
place,
views
that
he
had
taken
himself.
He
is
a
most
amiable,
charming
young
man,
I
believe.
Jane
was
quite
longing
to
go
to
Ireland,
from

ingenious

animating
suspicion

Considering
the
very
particular
friendship
between
her
and
Mrs.
Dixon,
you
could
hardly
have
expected
her
to
be
excused
from
accompanying
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell."
"Very
true,
very
true,
indeed.
The
very
thing
that
we
have
always
been
rather
afraid
of;
for
we
should
not
have
liked
to
have
her
at
such
a
distance
from
us,
for
months
together
not
able
to
come
if
any
thing
was
to
happen.
But
you
see,
every
thing
