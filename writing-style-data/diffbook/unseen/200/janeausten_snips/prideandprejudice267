way,
and
after
a
moment's
pause,
added:
"My
eldest
sister
has
been
in
town
these
three
months.
Have
you
never
happened
to
see
her
there?"
She
was
perfectly
sensible
that
he
never
had;
but
she
wished
to
see
whether
he
would
betray
any
consciousness
of
what
had
passed
between
the
Bingleys
and
Jane,
and
she
thought
he
looked
a
little
confused
as
he
answered
that
he
had
never
been
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
Miss
Bennet.
The
subject
was
pursued
no
farther,
and
the
gentlemen
soon
afterwards
went
away.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam's
manners
were
very
much
admired
at
the
Parsonage,
and
the
ladies
all
felt
that
he
must
add
considerably
to
the
pleasures
of
their
engagements
at
Rosings.
It
was
some
days,
however,
before
they
received
any
invitation
thither
for
while
there
were
visitors
in
the
house,
they
could
not
be
necessary;
and
it
was
not
till
Easter
day,
almost
a
week
after
the
gentlemen's
arrival,
that
they
were
honoured
by
such
an
attention,
and
then
they
were
merely
asked
on
leaving
church
to
come
there
in
the
evening.
For
the
last
week
they
had
seen
very
little
of
Lady
Catherine
or
her
daughter.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
had
called
at
the
Parsonage
