was
watching
for
the
sound
of
other
carriages,
impatient
to
begin,
or
afraid
of
being
always
near
her.
Mrs.
Elton
was
spoken
of.
"I
think
she
must
be
here
soon,"
said
he.
"I
have
a
great
curiosity
to
see
Mrs.
Elton,
I
have
heard
so
much
of
her.
It
cannot
be
long,
I
think,
before
she
comes."
A
carriage
was
heard.
He
was
on
the
move
immediately;
but
coming
back,
said,
"I
am
forgetting
that
I
am
not
acquainted
with
her.
I
have
never
seen
either
Mr.
or
Mrs.
Elton.
I
have
no
business
to
put
myself
forward."
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Elton
appeared;
and
all

smiles
and
the
proprieties
passed.
"But
Miss
Bates
and
Miss
Fairfax!"
said
Mr.
Weston,
looking
about.
"We
thought
you
were
to
bring
them."
The
mistake
had
been
slight.
The
carriage
was
sent
for
them
now.
Emma
longed
to
know
what
Frank's
first
opinion
of
Mrs.
Elton
might
be;
how
he
was
affected
by
the
studied
elegance
of
her
dress,
and
her
smiles
of
graciousness.
He
was
immediately
qualifying
himself
to
form
an
opinion,
by
giving
her
very
proper
attention,
after
the
introduction
had
passed.
In
a
few
minutes
the
carriage
returned.
Somebody
talked
