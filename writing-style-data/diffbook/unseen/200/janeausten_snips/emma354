did
not
give
her
the
use
of
their
own
instrument
which
must
now
be
shut
up
in
London,
untouched
by
any
body."
"That
is
a
grand
pianoforte,
and
he
might
think
it
too
large
for
Mrs.
Bates's
house."
"You
may
say
what
you
chuse
but
your
countenance
testifies
that
your
thoughts
on
this
subject
are
very
much
like
mine."
"I
do
not
know.
I
rather
believe
you
are
giving
me
more
credit
for
acuteness
than
I
deserve.
I
smile
because
you
smile,
and
shall
probably
suspect
whatever
I
find
you
suspect;
but
at
present
I
do
not
see
what
there
is
to
question.
If
Colonel
Campbell
is
not
the
person,
who
can
be?"
"What
do
you
say
to
Mrs.
Dixon?"
"Mrs.
Dixon!
very
true
indeed.
I
had
not
thought
of
Mrs.
Dixon.
She
must
know
as
well
as
her
father,
how
acceptable
an
instrument
would
be;
and
perhaps
the
mode
of
it,
the
mystery,
the
surprize,
is
more
like
a
young
woman's
scheme
than
an
elderly
man's.
It
is
Mrs.
Dixon,
I
dare
say.
I
told
you
that
your
suspicions
would
guide
mine."
"If
so,
you
must
extend
your
suspicions
and
comprehend
Mr.
Dixon
in
them."
"Mr.
Dixon.
Very
well.
