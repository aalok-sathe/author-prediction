to
the
imperfection
of
the
performance.
When
you
told
Mrs.
Bennet
this
morning
that
if
you
ever
resolved
upon
quitting
Netherfield
you
should
be
gone
in
five
minutes,
you
meant
it
to
be
a
sort
of
panegyric,
of
compliment
to
yourself
and
yet
what
is
there
so
very
laudable
in
a
precipitance
which
must
leave
very
necessary
business
undone,
and
can
be
of
no
real
advantage
to
yourself
or
anyone
else?"
"Nay,"
cried
Bingley,
"this
is
too
much,
to
remember
at

that

the

believed
it;
but
I
am
by
no
means
convinced
that
you
would
be
gone
with
such
celerity.
Your
conduct
would
be
quite
as
dependent
on
chance
as
that
of
any
man
I
know;
and
if,
as
you
were
mounting
your
horse,
a
friend
were
to
say,
'Bingley,
you
had
better
stay
till
next
week,'
you
would
probably
do
it,
you
would
probably
