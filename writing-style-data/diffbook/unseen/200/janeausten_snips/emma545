that
you
would
have
chosen
for
him
better
than
he
has
chosen
for
himself.
Harriet
Smith
has
some
first
rate
qualities,
which
Mrs.
Elton
is
totally
without.
An
unpretending,
single
minded,
artless
girl
infinitely
to
be
preferred
by
any
man
of
sense
and
taste
to
such
a
woman
as
Mrs.
Elton.
I
found
Harriet
more
conversable
than
I
expected."
Emma
was
extremely
gratified.
They
were
interrupted
by
the
bustle
of
Mr.
Weston
calling
on
every
body
to
begin
dancing
again.
"Come
Miss
Woodhouse,
Miss
Otway,
Miss
Fairfax,
what
are
you
all
doing?
Come
Emma,
set
your
companions
the
example.
Every
body
is
lazy!
Every
body
is
asleep!"
"I
am
ready,"
said
Emma,
"whenever
I
am
wanted."
"Whom
are
you
going
to
dance
with?"
asked
Mr.
Knightley.
She
hesitated
a
moment,
and
then
replied,
"With
you,
if
you
will
ask
me."
"Will
you?"
said
he,
offering
his
hand.
"Indeed
I
will.
You
have
shewn
that
you
can
dance,
and
you
know
we
are
not
really
so
much
brother
and
sister
as
to
make
it
at
all
improper."
"Brother
and
sister!
no,
indeed."
This
little
explanation
with
Mr.
Knightley
gave
Emma
considerable
pleasure.
It
was
one
of
the
agreeable
recollections
of
the
