him."
"And
if
I
did,
(which,
however,
I
am
far
from
allowing)
I
should
not
feel
that
I
had
done
wrong.
Mr.
Martin
is
a
very
respectable
young
man,
but
I
cannot
admit
him
to
be
Harriet's
equal;
and
am
rather
surprized
indeed
that
he
should
have
ventured
to
address
her.
By
your
account,
he
does
seem
to
have
had
some
scruples.
It
is
a
pity
that
they
were
ever
got
over."
"Not
Harriet's
equal!"
exclaimed
Mr.
Knightley
loudly
and
warmly;
and
with
calmer
asperity,
added,
a
few
moments
afterwards,
"No,
he
is
not
her
equal
indeed,
for
he
is
as
much
her
superior
in
sense
as
in
situation.
Emma,
your
infatuation
about
that
girl
blinds
you.
What

Harriet
Smith's
claims,
either
of
birth,
nature
or
education,
to
any
connexion
higher
than
Robert
Martin?
She
is
the
natural
daughter
of
nobody
knows
whom,
with
probably
no
settled
provision
at
all,
and
certainly
no
respectable
relations.
She
is
known
only
as
parlour
boarder
at
a
common
school.
She
is
not
a
sensible
girl,
nor
a
girl
of
any
information.
She
has
been
taught
nothing
useful,
and
is
too
young
and
too
simple
to
have
acquired
any
thing
herself.
