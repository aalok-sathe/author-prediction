of
the
ballroom's
being
built,
suppers
had
not
been
in
question;
and
a
small
card
room
adjoining,
was
the
only
addition.
What
was
to
be
done?
This
card
room
would
be
wanted
as
a
card
room
now;
or,
if
cards
were
conveniently
voted
unnecessary
by
their
four
selves,
still
was
it
not
too
small
for
any
comfortable
supper?
Another
room
of
much
better
size
might
be
secured
for
the
purpose;
but
it
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
house,
and
a
long
awkward
passage
must
be
gone
through
to
get
at
it.
This
made
a
difficulty.
Mrs.
Weston
was
afraid
of
draughts
for
the
young
people
in
that
passage;
and
neither
Emma
nor
the
gentlemen
could
tolerate
the
prospect
of
being
miserably
crowded
at
supper.
Mrs.
Weston
proposed
having
no
regular
supper;
merely
sandwiches,
&c.,
set
out
in
the
little
room;
but
that
was
scouted
as
a
wretched
suggestion.
A
private
dance,
without
sitting
down
to
supper,
was
pronounced
an
infamous
fraud
upon
the
rights
of
men
and
women;
and
Mrs.
Weston
must
not
speak
of
it
again.
She
then
took
another
line
of
expediency,
and
looking
into
the
doubtful
room,
observed,
"I
do
not
think
it
is
so
