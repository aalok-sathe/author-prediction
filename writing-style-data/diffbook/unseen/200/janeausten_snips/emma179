not
to
go
out
to
day
and
dissuade
my
father
from
venturing;
but
as
he
has
made
up
his
mind,
and
does
not
seem
to
feel
the
cold
himself,
I
do
not
like
to
interfere,
as
I
know
it
would
be
so
great

of
such

fair
lady,
and
not

to
resist
any
advice
of
her's,
he
had
not
really
the

inclination
to

the
visit;
but

and
busy
in
her

previous
conceptions
and
views
to

was
very
