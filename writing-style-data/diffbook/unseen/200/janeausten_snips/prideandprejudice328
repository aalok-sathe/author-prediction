felt
herself
so
dull
as
to
make
her
very
desirous
of
having
them
all
to
dine
with
her.
Elizabeth
could
not
see
Lady
Catherine
without
recollecting
that,
had
she
chosen
it,
she
might
by
this
time
have
been
presented
to
her
as
her
future
niece;
nor
could
she
think,
without
a
smile,
of
what
her
ladyship's
indignation
would
have
been.
"What
would
she
have
said?
how

she
have
behaved?"
were
questions
with
which

Their
first
subject
was
the

the
Rosings
party.
"I
assure
you,

said
Lady
Catherine;
"I
believe

the
loss
of

But
I

to
me!
They
were
excessively
sorry
to
go!
But
so
they
always
are.
The
dear
Colonel
rallied
his
spirits
tolerably
till
just
at
last;
but
Darcy
seemed
to
feel
it
most
acutely,
more,
I
think,
than
last
year.
His
attachment
to
Rosings
certainly
increases."
Mr.
Collins
had
a
compliment,
and
an
allusion
to
throw

here,
which
were
kindly
smiled

by
the
mother
and
daughter.
Lady
Catherine
observed,
after
dinner,
