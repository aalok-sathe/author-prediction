a
great
part
of
the
conversation
and
but
for
her
acquaintance
with
the
Martins
of
Abbey
Mill
Farm,
it
must
have
been
the
whole.
But
the
Martins
occupied
her
thoughts
a
good
deal;
she
had
spent
two
very
happy
months
with
them,
and
now
loved
to
talk
of
the
pleasures
of
her
visit,
and
describe
the
many
comforts
and
wonders
of
the
place.
Emma
encouraged
her
talkativeness
amused
by
such
a
picture
of
another
set
of
beings,
and
enjoying
the
youthful
simplicity
which
could
speak
with
so
much
exultation
of
Mrs.
Martin's
having
"two
parlours,
two
very
good

one
of
them
quite
as

as
Mrs.
Goddard's
drawing
room;
and
of
her
having

upper
maid
who
had
lived
five
and
twenty
years
with
her;
and
of
their
having
eight
cows,
two
of
them
Alderneys,
and
one
a
little
Welch
cow,
a
very
pretty
little
Welch
cow
indeed;
and
of
Mrs.
Martin's
saying
as
she
was
so
fond
of
it,
it
should
be
called
her
cow;
and
of
their
having
a
very
handsome
summer
house
in
their
garden,
where
some
day
next
year
they
were
all
to
drink
tea:
a
very
handsome
summer
house,
large
enough
to
