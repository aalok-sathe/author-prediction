uttered
that
did
not
relate
to
the
game,
except
when
Mrs.
Jenkinson
expressed
her
fears
of
Miss
de
Bourgh's
being
too
hot
or
too
cold,
or
having
too
much
or
too
little
light.
A
great
deal
more
passed
at
the
other
table.
Lady
Catherine
was
generally
speaking
stating
the
mistakes
of
the
three
others,
or
relating
some
anecdote
of
herself.
Mr.
Collins
was

From
these
instructions
they
were
summoned
by
the
arrival
of
the
coach;
and
with
many
speeches
of
thankfulness
on
Mr.
Collins's
side
and
as
many

they
departed.
As

as
they
had
driven
from
the
door,
Elizabeth
was
called
