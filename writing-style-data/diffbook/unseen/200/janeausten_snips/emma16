open
hearted
man
like
Weston,
and
a
rational,
unaffected
woman
like
Miss
Taylor,
may
be
safely
left
to
manage
their
own
concerns.
You
are
more
likely
to
have
done
harm
to
yourself,
than
good
to
them,
by
interference."
"Emma
never
thinks
of
herself,
if
she
can
do
good
to
others,"
rejoined
Mr.
Woodhouse,
understanding
but
in
part.
"But,
my
dear,
pray
do
not
make
any
more
matches;
they
are
silly
things,
and
break
up
one's
family
circle
grievously."
"Only
one
more,
papa;
only
for
Mr.
Elton.
Poor
Mr.
Elton!
You
like
Mr.
Elton,
papa,
I
must
look
about
for
a
wife
for
him.
There
is
nobody
in
Highbury
who
deserves
him
and
he
has
been
here
a
whole
year,
and
has
fitted
up
his
house
so
comfortably,
that
it
would
be
a
shame
to
have
him
single
any
longer
and
I
thought
when
he
was
joining
their
hands
to
day,
he
looked
so
very
much
as
if
he
would
like
to
have
the
same
kind
office
done
for
him!
I
think
very
well
of
Mr.
Elton,
and
this
is
the
only
way
I
have
of
doing
him
a
service."
"Mr.
Elton
is
a
very
pretty
young
man,
to
be
sure,
