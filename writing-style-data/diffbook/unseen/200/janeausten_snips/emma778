But
here
there
was
nothing
to
be
shifted
off
in
a
wild
speculation
on
the
future.
It
was
all
right,
all
open,
all
equal.
No
sacrifice
on
any
side
worth
the
name.
It
was
a
union
of
the
highest
promise
of
felicity
in
itself,
and
without
one
real,
rational
difficulty
to
oppose
or
delay
it.
Mrs.
Weston,
with
her
baby
on
her
knee,
indulging
in
such
reflections
as
these,
was
one
of
the
happiest
women
in
the
world.
If
any
thing
could
increase
her
delight,
it
was
perceiving
that
the
baby
would
soon
have
outgrown
its
first
set
of
caps.
The
news
was
universally
a
surprize
wherever
it
spread;
and
Mr.
Weston
had
his
five
minutes
share
of
it;
but
five
minutes
were
enough
to
familiarise
the
idea
to
his
quickness
of
mind.
He
saw
the
advantages
of
the
match,
and
rejoiced
in
them
with
all
the
constancy
of
his
wife;
but
the
wonder
of
it
was
very
soon
nothing;
and
by
the
end
of
an
hour
he
was
not
far
from
believing
that
he
had
always
foreseen
it.
"It
is
to
be
a
secret,
I
conclude,"
said
he.
"These
matters
are
always
a
secret,
till
it
is
found
out
