acknowledge
her
false
and
insolent
estimate
of
her
own
but
still,
from
family
attachment
and
habit,
and
thorough
excellence
of
mind,
he
had
loved
her,
and
watched
over
her
from
a
girl,
with
an
endeavour
to
improve
her,
and
an
anxiety
for
her
doing
right,
which
no
other
creature
had
at
all
shared.
In
spite
of
all
her
faults,
she
knew
she
was
dear
to
him;
might
she
not
say,
very
dear?
When
the
suggestions
of
hope,
however,
which
must
follow
here,
presented
themselves,
she
could
not
presume
to
indulge
them.
Harriet
Smith
might
think
herself
not
unworthy
of
being
peculiarly,
exclusively,
passionately
loved
by
Mr.
Knightley.
She
could
not.
She
could
not
flatter
herself
with
any
idea
of
blindness
in
his
attachment
to
her.
She
had
received
a
very
recent
proof
of
its
impartiality.
How
shocked
had
he
been
by
her
behaviour
to
Miss
Bates!
How
directly,
how
strongly
had
he
expressed
himself
to
her
on
the
subject!
Not
too
strongly
for
the
offence
but
far,
far
too
strongly
to
issue
from
any
feeling
softer
than
upright
justice
and
clear
sighted
goodwill.
She
had
no
hope,
nothing
to
deserve
the
name
of
hope,
that
he
could
have
that
sort
