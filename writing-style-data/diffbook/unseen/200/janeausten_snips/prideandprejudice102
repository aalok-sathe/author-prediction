most
elevated
rank,
instead
of
giving
her
consequence,
would
be
adorned
by
her.
These
are
the
kind
of
little
things
which
please
her
ladyship,
and
it
is
a
sort
of
attention
which
I
conceive
myself
peculiarly
bound
to
pay."
"You
judge
very
properly,"
said
Mr.
Bennet,
"and
it
is
happy
for
you
that
you
possess
the
talent
of
flattering
with
delicacy.
May
I
ask
whether
these
pleasing
attentions
proceed
from
the
impulse
of
the
moment,
or
are
the
result
of
previous
study?"
"They
arise
chiefly
from
what
is
passing
at
the
time,
and
though
I
sometimes
amuse
myself
with
suggesting
and
arranging
such
little
elegant
compliments
as
may
be
adapted
to
ordinary
occasions,
I
always
wish
to
give
them
as
unstudied
an
air
as
possible."
Mr.
Bennet's
expectations
were
fully
answered.
His
cousin
was
as
absurd
as
he
had
hoped,
and
he
listened
to
him
with
the
keenest
enjoyment,
maintaining
at
the
same
time
the
most
resolute
composure
of
countenance,
and,
except
in
an
occasional
glance
at
Elizabeth,
requiring
no
partner
in
his
pleasure.
By
tea
time,
however,
the
dose
had
been
enough,
and
Mr.
Bennet
was
glad
to
take
his
guest
into
the
drawing
room
again,
and,
