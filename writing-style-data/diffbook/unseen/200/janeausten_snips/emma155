very
hard
upon
Mr.
Weston
if
she
did
not,
papa.
You
quite
forget
poor
Mr.
Weston."
"I
think,
indeed,"
said
John
Knightley
pleasantly,
"that
Mr.
Weston
has
some
little
claim.
You
and
I,
Emma,
will
venture
to
take
the
part
of
the
poor
husband.
I,
being
a
husband,
and
you
not
being
a
wife,
the
claims
of
the
man
may
very
likely
strike
us
with
equal
force.
As
for

and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
misery
of
her
leaving
Hartfield,
I
should
never
have
thought
of
Miss
Taylor
but
as
the
most
fortunate
woman
in
the
world;
and
as
to
slighting
Mr.
Weston,
that
excellent
Mr.
Weston,
I
think
there
is
nothing
he
does
not
deserve.
I
believe
he
is
one
of
the
very
best
tempered
men
that
ever
existed.
Excepting
yourself
and
your
brother,
I
do
