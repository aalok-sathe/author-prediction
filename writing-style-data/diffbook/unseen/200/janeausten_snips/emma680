the
two
circumstances,
she
did,
after
a
little
reflection,
venture
the
following
question.
"Might
he
not?
Is
not
it
possible,
that
when
enquiring,
as
you
thought,
into
the
state
of
your
affections,
he
might
be
alluding
to
Mr.
Martin
he
might
have
Mr.
Martin's
interest
in

But
Harriet
rejected
the
suspicion

But
now
I
seem
to
feel
that
I
may
deserve
him;
and
that
if
he
does
chuse
me,
it
will
not
be
any
thing
so
very
wonderful."
The
bitter
feelings
occasioned
by
this
speech,
the
many
bitter
feelings,
made
the
utmost
exertion
necessary
on
Emma's
side,
to
enable
her
to
say
