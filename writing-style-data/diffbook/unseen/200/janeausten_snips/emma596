and
Emma
received
a
smile
which
seemed
to
say,
"These
are
my
own
concerns.
I
have
a
right
to
talk
on
such
subjects,
without
being
suspected
of
introducing
Robert
Martin."
She
did
not
suspect
him.
It
was
too
old
a
story.
Robert
Martin
had
probably
ceased
to
think
of
Harriet.
They
took
a
few
turns
together
along
the
walk.
The
shade
was
most
refreshing,
and
Emma
found
it
the
pleasantest
part
of

day.
The
next
remove
was
to
the
house;

his
black
mare.
He
had
expressed
himself
as
to
coming,
with
more
than
common
certainty.
"His
aunt
was
so
much
better,
that
he
had
not
a
doubt
of
getting
over
to
them."
Mrs.
Churchill's
state,
however,
as
many
were
ready
to
remind
her,
was
liable
