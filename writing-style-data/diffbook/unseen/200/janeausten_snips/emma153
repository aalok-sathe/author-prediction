"how
you
must
miss
her!
And
dear
Emma,
too!
What
a
dreadful
loss
to
you
both!
I
have
been
so
grieved
for
you.
I
could
not
imagine
how
you
could
possibly
do
without
her.
It
is
a
sad
change
indeed.
But
I
hope
she
is
pretty
well,
sir."
"Pretty
well,
my
dear
I
hope
pretty
well.
I
do
not
know
but
that
the
place
agrees
with
her
tolerably."
Mr.
John
Knightley
here
asked
Emma
quietly
whether
there
were
any
doubts
of
the
air
of
Randalls.
"Oh!
no
none
in
the
least.
I
never
saw
Mrs.
Weston
better
in
my
life
never
looking
so
well.
Papa
is
only
speaking
his
own
regret."
"Very
much
to
the
honour
of
both,"
was
the
handsome
reply.
"And
do
you
see
her,
sir,
tolerably
often?"
asked
Isabella
in
the
plaintive
tone
which
just
suited
her
father.
Mr.
Woodhouse
hesitated.
"Not
near
so
often,
my
dear,
as
I
could
wish."
"Oh!
papa,
we
have
missed
seeing
them
but
one
entire
day
since
they
married.
Either
in
the
morning
or
evening
of
every
day,
excepting
one,
have
we
seen
either
Mr.
Weston
or
Mrs.
Weston,
and
generally
both,
either
at
Randalls
or
here
and
as
you
may
