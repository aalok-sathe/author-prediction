to
such
a
man.
Mr.
Darcy
was
eyeing
him
with
unrestrained
wonder,
and
when
at
last
Mr.
Collins
allowed
him
time
to
speak,
replied
with
an
air
of
distant
civility.
Mr.
Collins,
however,
was
not
discouraged
from
speaking
again,
and
Mr.
Darcy's
contempt
seemed
abundantly
increasing
with
the
length
of
his
second
speech,
and
at
the
end
of
it
he
only
made
him
a
slight
bow,
and
moved
another
way.
Mr.
Collins
then
returned
to
Elizabeth.
"I
have
no
reason,
I
assure
you,"
said
he,
"to
be
dissatisfied
with
my
reception.
Mr.
Darcy
seemed
much
pleased
with
the
attention.
He
answered
me
with
the
utmost
civility,
and
even
paid
me
the
compliment
of
saying
that
he
was
so
well
convinced
of
Lady
Catherine's
discernment
as
to
be
certain
she
could
never
bestow
a
favour
unworthily.
It
was
really
a
very
handsome
thought.
Upon
the
whole,
I
am
much
pleased
with
him."
As
Elizabeth
had
no
longer
any
interest
of
her
own
to
pursue,
she
turned
her
attention
almost
entirely
on
her
sister
and
Mr.
Bingley;
and
the
train
of
agreeable
reflections
which
her
observations
gave
birth
to,
made
her
perhaps
almost
as
happy
as
Jane.
She
saw
her
in
idea
