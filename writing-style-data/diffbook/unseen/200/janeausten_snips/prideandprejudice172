for
the
end
of
the
conference,
no
sooner
saw
Elizabeth
open
the
door
and
with
quick
step
pass
her
towards
the
staircase,
than
she
entered
the
breakfast
room,
and
congratulated
both
him
and
herself
in
warm
terms
on
the
happy
prospect
of
their
nearer
connection.
Mr.
Collins
received
and
returned
these
felicitations
with
equal
pleasure,
and
then
proceeded
to
relate
the
particulars

"But,

Mr.
Collins,"
she
added,
"that
Lizzy
shall
be
brought
to
reason.
I
will
speak
to
her
about
it
directly.
She
is
a
very
headstrong,
foolish
girl,
and
does
not
know
her
own
interest
but
I
will
make
her
know

"Pardon
me
for
interrupting
you,
madam,"
cried
Mr.
Collins;
"but

she
