she
had
lent
Elizabeth
to
copy,
a
letter
to
herself;
and
this
letter
was
from
him,
from
Mr.
Martin,
and
contained
a
direct
proposal
of
marriage.
"Who
could
have
thought
it?
She
was
so
surprized
she
did
not
know
what
to
do.
Yes,
quite
a
proposal
of
marriage;
and
a
very
good
letter,
at
least
she
thought
so.
And
he
wrote
as
if
he
really
loved
her
very
much
but
she
did
not
know
and
so,
she
was
come
as
fast
as
she
could
to
ask
Miss
Woodhouse
what
she
should
do.
"
Emma
was
half
ashamed
of
her
friend
for
seeming
so
pleased
and
so
doubtful.
"Upon
my
word,"
she
cried,
"the
young
man
is
determined
not
to
lose
any
thing
for
want
of
asking.
He
will
connect
himself
well
if
he
can."
"Will
you
read
the
letter?"
cried
Harriet.
"Pray
do.
I'd
rather
you
would."
Emma
was
not
sorry
to
be
pressed.
She
read,
and
was
surprized.
The
style
of
the
letter
was
much
above
her
expectation.
There
were
not
merely
no
grammatical
errors,
but
as
a
composition
it
would
not
have
disgraced
a
gentleman;
the
language,
though
plain,
was
strong
and
unaffected,
and
the
sentiments
it
conveyed
