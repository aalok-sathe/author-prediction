to
Meryton
to
inquire
if
Mr.
Wickham
were
returned,
and
to
lament
over
his
absence
from
the
Netherfield
ball.
He
joined
them
on
their
entering
the
town,
and
attended
them
to
their
aunt's
where
his
regret
and
vexation,
and
the
concern
of
everybody,
was
well
talked
over.
To
Elizabeth,
however,
he
voluntarily
acknowledged
that
the
necessity
of
his
absence
had
been
self
imposed.
"I
found,"
said
he,
"as
the
time
drew
near
that
I
had
better
not
meet
Mr.
Darcy;
that
to
be
in
the
same
room,
the
same
party
with
him
for
so
many
hours
together,
might
be
more
than
I
could
bear,
and
that
scenes
might
arise
unpleasant
to
more
than
myself."
She
highly
approved
his
forbearance,
and
they
had
leisure
for
a
full
discussion
of
it,
and
for
all
the
commendation
which
they
civilly
bestowed
on
each
other,
as
Wickham
and
another
officer
walked
back
with
them
to
Longbourn,
and
during
the
walk
he
particularly
attended
to
her.
His
accompanying
them
was
a
double
advantage;
she
felt
all
the
compliment
it
offered
to
herself,
and
it
was
most
acceptable
as
an
occasion
of
introducing
him
to
her
father
and
mother.
Soon
after
their
return,
a
letter
was
