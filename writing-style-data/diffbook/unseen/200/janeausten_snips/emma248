on,
and
she
knew
she
was
considered
by
the
very
few
who
presumed
ever
to
see
imperfection
in
her,
as
rather
negligent
in
that
respect,
and
as
not
contributing
what
she
ought
to
the
stock
of
their
scanty
comforts.
She
had
had
many
a
hint
from
Mr.
Knightley
and
some
from
her
own
heart,
as
to
her
deficiency
but
none
were
equal

counteract
the
persuasion
of
its
being
very
disagreeable,

she
made
the
sudden
resolution
of
not
passing
their
door
without
going
in
observing,
as
she
proposed
it
to
Harriet,
that,
as
well
as
she
could
calculate,
they
were
just
now
quite
safe
from
any
letter
from
Jane
Fairfax.
The
house
belonged
to
people
in
business.
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
occupied
the
drawing
room
floor;
and
there,
in
the
very
moderate
sized
apartment,
which
was
every
thing
to
them,
the
visitors
were
most
cordially
and
even
gratefully
welcomed;
the
quiet
neat
old
lady,
who

her
