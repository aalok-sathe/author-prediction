weather,
I
think
every
body
feels
a
north
east
wind.
I
felt
for
your
dear
father
very
much
in
the
storm
of
Tuesday
afternoon
and
yesterday
morning,
but
had
the
comfort
of
hearing
last
night,
by
Mr.
Perry,
that
it
had
not
made
him
ill.
"Yours
ever,
"A.

Mrs.
Weston.]

JULY.
MY
DEAR
MADAM,
"If
I
made
myself
intelligible
yesterday,
this
letter
will
be
expected;
but
expected
or
not,
I
know
it
will
be
read
with
candour
and
indulgence.
You
are
all
goodness,
and
I
believe
there
will
be
need
of
even
all
your
goodness
to
allow
for
some
parts
of
my
past
conduct.
But
I
have
been
forgiven
by
one
who
had
still
more
to
resent.
My
courage
rises
while
I
write.
It
is
very
difficult
for
the
prosperous
to
be
humble.
I
have
already
met
with
such
success
in
two
applications
for
pardon,
that
I
may
be
in
danger
of
thinking
myself
too
sure
of
yours,
and
of
those
among
your
friends
who
have
had
any
ground
of
offence.
You
must
all
endeavour
to
comprehend
the
exact
nature
of
my
situation
when
I
first
arrived
at
Randalls;
you
must
consider
me
as
having
a
secret
