jump."
They
were
permitted
to
go
alone;
and
with
a
cordial
nod
from
one,
and
a
graceful
bow
from
the
other,
the
two
gentlemen
took
leave.
Emma
remained
very
well
pleased
with
this
beginning
of
the
acquaintance,
and
could
now
engage
to
think
of
them
all
at
Randalls
any
hour
of
the
day,
with
full
confidence
in
their
comfort.
The
next
morning
brought
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
again.
He
came
with
Mrs.
Weston,
to
whom
and
to
Highbury
he
seemed
to
take
very
cordially.
He
had

him,
he
should
always
chuse
the
same.
Highbury,
that
airy,
cheerful,
happy
looking
Highbury,
would
be
his
constant
attraction."
Highbury,
with
Mrs.
Weston,
stood
for
Hartfield;
and
she
trusted
to
its
bearing
the
same
construction
with
him.
They
walked
thither
directly.
Emma
had
hardly
expected
them:
for
Mr.
Weston,
who
had
called
in
for
half
a
minute,
in
order
to
hear
that
his
son
was
very
handsome,
knew
nothing
of
their
