the
least
idea
of
his
being
a
weak
young
man:
I
feel
sure
that
he
is
not.
Mr.
Weston
would
not
be
blind
to
folly,
though
in
his
own
son;
but
he
is
very
likely
to
have
a
more
yielding,
complying,
mild
disposition
than
would
suit
your
notions
of
man's
perfection.
I
dare
say
he
has;
and
though
it
may
cut
him
off
from
some
advantages,
it
will
secure
him
many
others."
"Yes;
all
the
advantages
of
sitting
still
when
he
ought
to
move,
and
of
leading
a
life
of
mere
idle
pleasure,
and
fancying
himself
extremely
expert
in
finding
excuses
for
it.
He
can
sit
down
and
write
a
fine
flourishing
letter,
full
of
professions
and
falsehoods,
and
persuade
himself
that
he
has
hit
upon
the
very
best
method
in
the
world
of
preserving
peace
at
home
and
preventing
his
father's
having
any
right
to
complain.
His
letters
disgust
me."
"Your
feelings
are
singular.
They
seem
to
satisfy
every
body
else."
"I
suspect
they
do
not
satisfy
Mrs.
Weston.
They
hardly
can
satisfy
a
woman
of
her
good
sense
and
quick
feelings:
standing
in
a
mother's
place,
but
without
a
mother's
affection
to
blind
her.
It
