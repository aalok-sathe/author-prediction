party,
Harriet
would
be
rather
a
dead
weight
than
otherwise;
but
for
the
poor
girl
herself,
it
seemed
a
peculiarly
cruel
necessity
that
was
to
be
placing
her
in
such
a
state
of
unmerited
punishment.
In
time,
of
course,
Mr.
Knightley
would
be
forgotten,
that
is,
supplanted;
but
this
could
not
be
expected
to
happen
very
early.
Mr.
Knightley
himself
would
be
doing
nothing
to
assist
the
cure;
not
like
Mr.
Elton.
Mr.
Knightley,
always
so
kind,
so
feeling,
so
truly
considerate
for
every
body,
would
never
deserve
to
be
less
worshipped
than
now;
and
it
really
was
too
much
to
hope
even
of
Harriet,
that
she
could
be
in
love
with
more
than
three
men
in
one
year.
It
was
a
very
great
relief
to
Emma
to
find
Harriet
as
desirous
as
herself
to
avoid
a
meeting.
Their
intercourse
was
painful
enough
by
letter.
How
much
worse,
had
they
been
obliged
to
meet!
Harriet
expressed
herself
very
much
as
might
be
supposed,
without
reproaches,
or
apparent
sense
of
ill
usage;
and
yet
Emma
fancied
there
was
a
something
of
resentment,
a
something
bordering
on
it
in
her
style,
which
increased
the
desirableness
of
their
being
separate.
It
might
be
