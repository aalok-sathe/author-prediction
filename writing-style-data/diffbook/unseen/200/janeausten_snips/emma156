equal
for
temper.
I
shall
never
forget
his
flying
Henry's
kite
for
him
that
very
windy
day
last
Easter
and
ever
since
his
particular
kindness
last
September
twelvemonth
in
writing
that
note,
at
twelve
o'clock
at
night,
on
purpose
to
assure
me
that
there
was
no
scarlet
fever
at
Cobham,
I
have
been
convinced
there
could
not
be
a
more
feeling
heart
nor
a
better
man
in
existence.
If
any
body
can
deserve
him,
it
must
be
Miss
Taylor."
"Where
is
the
young
man?"
said
John
Knightley.
"Has
he
been
here
on
this
occasion
or
has
he
not?"
"He
has
not
been
here
yet,"
replied
Emma.
"There
was
a
strong
expectation
of
his
coming
soon
after
the
marriage,
but
it
ended
in
nothing;
and
I
have
not
heard
him
mentioned
lately."
"But
you
should
tell
them
of
the
letter,
my
dear,"
said
her
father.
"He
wrote
a
letter
to
poor
Mrs.
Weston,
to
congratulate
her,
and
a
very
proper,
handsome
letter
it
was.
She
shewed
it
to
me.
I
thought
it
very
well
done
of
him
indeed.
Whether
it
was
his
own
idea
you
know,
one
cannot
tell.
He
is
but
young,
and
his
uncle,
perhaps
"
"My
dear
papa,
