not
opposed.
All
was
safe
and
prosperous;
and
as
the
removal
of
one
solicitude
generally
makes
way
for
another,
Emma,
being
now
certain
of
her
ball,
began
to
adopt
as
the
next
vexation
Mr.
Knightley's
provoking
indifference
about
it.
Either
because
he
did
not
dance
himself,
or
because
the
plan
had
been
formed
without
his
being
consulted,
he
seemed
resolved
that
it
should
not
interest
him,
determined
against
its
exciting
any
present
curiosity,
or
affording
him
any
future
amusement.

her
voluntary
communications

to
say
against
it,
but
that
they
shall
not
chuse
pleasures
for
me.
Oh!
yes,
I
must
be
there;
I
could
not
refuse;
and
I
will
keep
as
much
awake
as
I
can;
but
I
would
rather
be
at
home,
looking
over
William
Larkins's
week's
account;
much
rather,
I
confess.
Pleasure
in
seeing
dancing!
not
I,
indeed
I
never
look
at
it
I
do
not
know
who
does.
Fine
dancing,
I
believe,
like
virtue,
must
be
its
own
reward.
