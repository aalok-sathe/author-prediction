offering
one
argument
in
favour
of
its
propriety."
"To
yield
readily
easily
to
the
persuasion
of
a
friend
is
no
merit
with
you."
"To
yield
without
conviction
is
no
compliment
to
the
understanding
of
either."
"You
appear
to
me,
Mr.
Darcy,
to
allow
nothing

into
it?"
"Will
it
not
be
advisable,
before
we

degree
of
