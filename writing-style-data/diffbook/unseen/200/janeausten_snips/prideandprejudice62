estimable
than
such
a
one
as
yours."
"Lizzy,"
cried
her
mother,
"remember
where
you
are,
and
do
not
run
on
in
the
wild
manner
that
you
are
suffered
to
do
at
home."
"I
did
not
know
before,"
continued
Bingley
immediately,
"that
you

Everybody
was
surprised,
and
Darcy,
after
looking
at
her
for
a
moment,
turned
silently
away.
Mrs.
Bennet,
who
fancied
she
had
gained
a
complete
victory
over
him,
continued
her
triumph.
"I
cannot
