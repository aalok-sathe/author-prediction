and
was
now
forming
all
her
views
of
happiness.
Harriet
was
a
little
distressed
did
look
a
little
foolish
at
first:
but
having
once
owned
that
she
had
been
presumptuous
and
silly,
and
self
deceived,
before,
her
pain
and
confusion
seemed
to
die
away
with
the
words,
and
leave
her
without
a
care

Harriet
had
always
liked
Robert
Martin;
and
that
his
continuing
to
love

been
irresistible.
Beyond

it
must
ever
be
unintelligible
to
Emma.
The
event,
however,
was
most
joyful;
and
every
day
was
giving
her
fresh
reason
for
thinking
so.
Harriet's
parentage
became
known.
She
proved
to
be
the
daughter
of
a
tradesman,
rich
enough
to
afford
her
the
comfortable
maintenance
which
