wanted
to
be
alone
with
Jane,
proposed
their
all
walking
out.
It
was
agreed
to.
Mrs.
Bennet
was
not
in
the
habit
of
walking;
Mary
could
never
spare
time;
but
the
remaining
five
set
off
together.
Bingley
and
Jane,
however,
soon
allowed
the
others
to
outstrip
them.
They
lagged
behind,
while
Elizabeth,
Kitty,
and
Darcy
were
to
entertain
each
other.
Very
little
was
said
by
either;
Kitty
was
too
much
afraid
of
him
to
talk;
Elizabeth
was
secretly
forming
a
desperate
resolution;
and
perhaps
he
might
be
doing
the
same.
They
walked
towards
the
Lucases,
because
Kitty
wished
to
call
upon
Maria;
and
as
Elizabeth
saw
no
occasion
for
making
it
a
general
concern,
when
Kitty
left
them
she
went
boldly
on
with
him
alone.
Now
was
the
moment
for
her
resolution
to
be
executed,
and,
while
her
courage
was
high,
she
immediately
said:
"Mr.
Darcy,
I
am
a
very
selfish
creature;
and,
for
the
sake
of
giving
relief
to
my
own
feelings,
care
not
how
much
I
may
be
wounding
yours.
I
can
no
longer
help
thanking
you
for
your
unexampled
kindness
to
my
poor
sister.
Ever
since
I
have
known
it,
I
have
been
most
anxious
to
acknowledge
