was
an
effort;
especially
as
something
was
going
on
amongst
the
others,
in
the
most
overpowering
period
of
Mr.
Elton's
nonsense,
which
she
particularly
wished
to
listen
to.
She
heard
enough
to
know
that
Mr.
Weston
was
giving
some
information
about
his
son;
she
heard
the
words
"my
son,"
and
"Frank,"
and
"my
son,"
repeated
several
times
over;
and,
from
a
few
other
half
syllables
very
much
suspected
that
he
was
announcing
an
early
visit
from
his
son;
but
before
she
could
quiet
Mr.
Elton,
the
subject
was
so
completely
past
that
any
reviving
question
from
her
would
have
been
awkward.
Now,
it
so
happened
that
in
spite
of
Emma's
resolution
of
never
marrying,
there
was
something
in
the
name,
in
the
idea
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill,
which
always
interested
her.
She
had
frequently
thought
especially
since
his
father's
marriage
with
Miss
Taylor
that
if
she
were
to
marry,
he
was
the
very
person
to
suit
her
in
age,
character
and
condition.
He
seemed
by
this
connexion
between
the
families,
quite
to
belong
to
her.
She
could
not
but
suppose
it
to
be
a
match
that
every
body
who
knew
them
must
think
of.

Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
