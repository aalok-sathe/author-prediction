to
do;
so
she
ran
on
directly,
as
fast
as
she
could,
and
took
shelter
at
Ford's."
Ford's
was
the
principal
woollen
draper,
linen
draper,
and
haberdasher's
shop
united;
the
shop
first
in
size
and
fashion
in
the
place.
"And
so,
there
she
had
set,
without
an
idea
of
any
thing
in
the
world,
full
ten
minutes,
perhaps
when,
all
of
a
sudden,
who
should
come
in
to
be
sure
it
was
so
very
odd!
but
they
always
dealt
at
Ford's
who
should
come
in,
but
Elizabeth
Martin
and
her
brother!
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse!
only
think.
I
thought
I
should
have
fainted.
I
did
not
know
what
to
do.
I
was
sitting
near
the
door
Elizabeth
saw
me
directly;
but
he
did
not;
he
was
busy
with
the
umbrella.
I
am
sure
she
saw
me,
but
she
looked
away
directly,
and
took
no
notice;
and
they
both
went
to
quite
the
farther
end
of
the
shop;
and
I
kept
sitting
near
the
door!
Oh!
dear;
I
was
so
miserable!
I
am
sure
I
must
have
been
as
white
as
my
gown.
I
could
not
go
away
you
know,
because
of
the
rain;
but
I
did
so
wish
myself
anywhere
in
