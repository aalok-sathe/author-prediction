and
Mrs.
Suckling,
the
Highbury
world
were
obliged
to
endure
the
mortification
of
hearing
that
they
could
not
possibly
come
till
the
autumn.
No
such
importation
of
novelties
could
enrich
their
intellectual
stores
at
present.
In
the
daily
interchange
of
news,
they
must
be
again
restricted
to
the
other
topics
with
which
for
a
while
the
Sucklings'
coming
had
been
united,
such
as
the
last
accounts
of
Mrs.
Churchill,
whose
health
seemed
every
day
to
supply
a
different
report,
and
the
situation
of
Mrs.
Weston,
whose
happiness
it
was
to
be
hoped
might
eventually
be
as
much
increased
by
the
arrival
of
a
child,
as
that
of
all
her
neighbours
was
by
the
approach
of
it.
Mrs.
Elton
was
very
much
disappointed.
It
was
the
delay
of
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
parade.
Her
introductions
and
recommendations
must
all
wait,
and
every
projected
party
be
still
only
talked
of.
So
she
thought
at
first;
but
a
little
consideration
convinced
her
that
every
thing
need
not
be
put
off.
Why
should
not
they
explore
to
Box
Hill
though
the
Sucklings
did
not
come?
They
could
go
there
again
with
them
in
the
autumn.
It
was
settled
that
they
should
go
