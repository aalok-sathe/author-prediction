of
every
body,
and
so
little
of
themselves,
that
every
kindly
feeling
was
at
work
for
them.
Miss
Fairfax's
recent
illness
had
offered
a
fair
plea
for
Mrs.
Weston
to
invite
her
to
an
airing;
she
had
drawn
back
and
declined
at
first,
but,
on
being
pressed
had
yielded;
and,
in
the
course
of
their
drive,
Mrs.
Weston
had,
by
gentle
encouragement,
overcome
so

her
embarrassment,
as

Apologies
for
her

such
conversation
must
be
the
greatest
relief
to
her
companion,
pent
up
within
her
own
mind
as
every
thing
had
so
long
been,
and
was
very
much
pleased
with
all
that
she
had
said
on
the
subject.
"On
the
misery
of
what
she
had
suffered,
during
the
concealment
of
so
many
months,"
continued
Mrs.
Weston,
"she
