and
where
they
were
now
to
spend
a
few
days,
was
probably
as
great
an
object
of
her
curiosity
as
all
the
celebrated
beauties
of
Matlock,
Chatsworth,
Dovedale,
or
the
Peak.
Elizabeth
was
excessively
disappointed;
she
had
set
her
heart
on
seeing
the
Lakes,
and
still
thought
there
might
have
been
time
enough.
But
it
was
her
business
to
be
satisfied
and
certainly
her
temper
to
be
happy;
and
all
was
soon
right
again.
With
the
mention
of
Derbyshire
there
were
many
ideas
connected.
It
was
impossible
for
her
to
see
the
word
without
thinking
of
Pemberley
and
its
owner.
"But
surely,"
said
she,
"I
may
enter
his
county
with
impunity,
and
rob
it
of
a
few
petrified
spars
without
his
perceiving
me."
The
period
of
expectation
was
now
doubled.
Four
weeks
were
to
pass
away
before
her
uncle
and
aunt's
arrival.
But
they
did
pass
away,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner,
with
their
four
children,
did
at
length
appear
at
Longbourn.
The
children,
two
girls
of
six
and
eight
years
old,
and
two
younger
boys,
were
to
be
left
under
the
particular
care
of
their
cousin
Jane,
who
was
the
general
favourite,
and
whose
steady
sense
and
sweetness
of
