sort

I
never
shall
forget
his
manner.
And
when
I
brought
out
the
baked
apples
from
the
closet,
and
hoped
our
friends
would
be
so
very
obliging
as
to
take
some,
'Oh!'
said
he
directly,
'there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
fruit
half
so
good,
and
these
are
the
finest
looking
home
baked
apples
I
ever
saw
in
my

That,
you
know,
was
so
very....
And
I
am
sure,
by
his
manner,
it
was
no
compliment.
Indeed
they
are
very

and
Mrs.

and
Mr.
Woodhouse
made

promise
to
have
them
done

Miss
Woodhouse
will
be
so
good
as
not
to
mention
it.
The
apples
themselves
are
the
very
finest
sort
for
baking,
beyond
a
doubt;
all
from
Donwell
some
of
Mr.
Knightley's
most
liberal
supply.
He
sends
us
a
sack
every
year;
and
certainly
there
never
was
such
a
keeping
apple
anywhere
as
one
of
his
trees
I
believe
there
is
two
of
them.
My
mother
says
the
orchard
was
always
famous
in
her
younger
days.
But
I
was
really
quite
