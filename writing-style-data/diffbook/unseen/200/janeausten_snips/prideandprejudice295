with
representing
to
her
the
strength
of
that
attachment
which,
in
spite
of
all
his
endeavours,
he
had
found
impossible
to
conquer;
and
with
expressing
his
hope
that
it
would
now
be
rewarded
by
her
acceptance
of
his
hand.
As
he
said
this,
she
could
easily
see
that
he
had
no
doubt
of
a
favourable
answer.
He
spoke
of
apprehension
and
anxiety,

expressed

security.
Such

thank
you.
But
I

have
never
desired
your
good
opinion,
and
you
have
certainly
bestowed
it
most
unwillingly.
I
am
sorry
to
have
occasioned
pain
to
anyone.
It
has
been
most
unconsciously
done,
however,
and
I
hope
will
be
of
short
duration.
The
feelings
which,
you
tell

have
long

acknowledgment
of
your
