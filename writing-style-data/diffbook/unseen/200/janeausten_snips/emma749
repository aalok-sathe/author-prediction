only
her
own
consciousness;
but
it
seemed
as
if
an
angel
only
could
have
been
quite
without
resentment
under
such
a
stroke.
She
had
no
difficulty
in
procuring
Isabella's
invitation;
and
she
was
fortunate
in
having
a
sufficient
reason
for
asking
it,
without
resorting
to
invention.
There
was
a
tooth
amiss.
Harriet
really
wished,
and
had
wished
some
time,
to
consult
a
dentist.
Mrs.
John
Knightley
was
delighted
to
be
of
use;
any
thing
of
ill
health
was
a
recommendation
to
her
and
though
not
so
fond
of
a
dentist
as
of
a
Mr.
Wingfield,
she
was
quite
eager
to
have
Harriet
under
her
care.
When
it
was
thus
settled
on
her
sister's
side,
Emma
proposed
it
to
her
friend,
and
found
her
very
persuadable.
Harriet
was
to
go;
she
was
invited
for
at
least
a
fortnight;
she
was
to
be
conveyed
in
Mr.
Woodhouse's
carriage.
It
was
all
arranged,
it
was
all
completed,
and
Harriet
was
safe
in
Brunswick
Square.
Now
Emma
could,
indeed,
enjoy
Mr.
Knightley's
visits;
now
she
could
talk,
and
she
could
listen
with
true
happiness,
unchecked
by
that
sense
of
injustice,
of
guilt,
of
something
most
painful,
which
had
haunted
her
when
remembering
how
disappointed
