no
longer
to
be
gained
by
him.
Their
eyes
were
immediately
wandering
up
in
the
street
in
quest
of
the
officers,
and
nothing
less
than
a
very
smart
bonnet
indeed,
or
a
really
new
muslin
in
a
shop
window,
could
recall
them.
But
the
attention
of
every
lady
was
soon
caught
by
a
young
man,
whom
they
had
never
seen
before,
of
most
gentlemanlike
appearance,
walking
with
another
officer
on
the
other
side
of
the
way.
The
officer
was
the
very
Mr.
Denny
concerning
whose
return
from
London
Lydia
came
to
inquire,
and
he
bowed
as
they
passed.
All
were
struck
with
the
stranger's
air,
all
wondered
who
he
could
be;
and
Kitty
and
Lydia,
determined
if
possible
to
find
out,
led
the
way
across
the
street,
under
pretense
of
wanting
something
in
an
opposite
shop,
and
fortunately
had
just
gained
the
pavement
when
the
two
gentlemen,
turning
back,
had
reached
the
same
spot.
Mr.
Denny
addressed
them
directly,
and
entreated
permission
to
introduce
his
friend,
Mr.
Wickham,
who
had
returned
with
him
the
day
before
from
town,
and
he
was
happy
to
say
had
accepted
a
commission
in
their
corps.
This
was
exactly
as
it
should
be;
for
the
