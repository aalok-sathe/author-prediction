would
have
been
desperate
awkwardness;
but
their
straightforward
emotions
left
no
room
for
the
little
zigzags
of
embarrassment.
Without
knowing
when
the
carriage
turned
into
Vicarage
Lane,
or
when
it
stopped,
they
found
themselves,
all
at
once,
at
the
door
of
his
house;
and
he
was
out
before
another
syllable
passed.
Emma
then
felt
it
indispensable
to
wish
him
a
good
night.
The
compliment
was
just
returned,
coldly
and
proudly;
and,
under
indescribable
irritation
of
spirits,
she
was
then
conveyed
to
Hartfield.
There
she
was

her
return
only
were
wanted
to
make
every
thing
go
well:
for
Mr.
John
Knightley,
ashamed
of
his
ill
humour,
was
now
all
kindness
and
attention;
and
so
particularly
solicitous
for
the
comfort
of
her
father,
as
to
seem
if
not
quite
ready
to
join
him
in
a
basin
of
gruel
perfectly
sensible
of
its
being
exceedingly
wholesome;
and
the
day
was
concluding
in
peace
and
