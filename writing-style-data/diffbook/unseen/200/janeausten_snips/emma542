Cox.'
My
dear
sir,
you
are
too
obliging.
Is
there
nobody
you
would
not
rather?
I
am
not
helpless.
Sir,
you
are
most
kind.
Upon
my
word,
Jane
on
one
arm,
and
me
on
the
other!
Stop,
stop,
let
us
stand
a
little
back,
Mrs.
Elton
is
going;
dear
Mrs.
Elton,
how
elegant
she
looks!
Beautiful
lace!
Now
we
all
follow
in
her
train.
Quite
the
queen
of
the
evening!
Well,
here
we
are
at
the
passage.
Two
steps,
Jane,
take
care
of
the
two
steps.
Oh!
no,
there
is
but
one.
Well,
I
was
persuaded
there
were
two.
How
very
odd!
I
was
convinced
there
were
two,
and
there
is
but
one.
I
never
saw
any
thing
equal
to
the
comfort
and
style
Candles
everywhere.
I
was
telling
you
of
your
grandmama,
Jane,
There
was
a
little
disappointment.
The
baked
apples
and
biscuits,
excellent
in
their
way,
you
know;
but
there
was
a
delicate
fricassee
of
sweetbread
and
some
asparagus
brought
in
at
first,
and
good
Mr.
Woodhouse,
not
thinking
the
asparagus
quite
boiled
enough,
sent
it
all
out
again.
Now
there
is
nothing
grandmama
loves
better
than
sweetbread
and
asparagus
so
she
was
rather
disappointed,
but
we
agreed
