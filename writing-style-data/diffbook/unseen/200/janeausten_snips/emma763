have
been
impertinent."
"Oh!"
cried
Jane,
with
a
blush
and
an
hesitation
which
Emma
thought
infinitely
more
becoming
to
her
than
all
the
elegance
of
all
her
usual
composure
"there
would
have
been
no
danger.
The
danger
would
have
been
of
my
wearying
you.
You
could
not
have
gratified
me
more
than
by
expressing
an
interest
.
Indeed,
Miss
Woodhouse,
(speaking
more
collectedly,)
with
the
consciousness
which
I
have
of
misconduct,
very
great
misconduct,
it
is
particularly
consoling
to
me
to
know
that
those
of
my
friends,
whose
good
opinion
is
most
worth
preserving,
are
not
disgusted
to
such
a
degree
as
to
I
have
not
time
for
half
that
I
could
wish
to
say.
I
long
to
make
apologies,
excuses,
to
urge
something
for
myself.
I
feel
it
so
very
due.
But,
unfortunately
in
short,
if
your
compassion
does
not
stand
my
friend
"
"Oh!
you
are
too
scrupulous,
indeed
you
are,"
cried
Emma
warmly,
and
taking
her
hand.
"You
owe
me
no
apologies;
and
every
body
to
whom
you
might
be
supposed
to
owe
them,
is
so
perfectly
satisfied,
so
delighted
even
"
"You
are
very
kind,
but
I
know
what
my
manners
were
to
you.
So
cold
