a
heart
was
near
her,
how
much
might
at
that
moment,
and
at
a
little
distance,
be
enduring
by
the
feelings
which
she
had
led
astray
herself.
The
difference
of
Harriet
at
Mrs.
Goddard's,
or
in
London,
made
perhaps
an
unreasonable
difference
in
Emma's
sensations;
but
she
could
not
think
of
her
in
London
without
objects
of
curiosity
and
employment,
which
must
be
averting
the
past,
and
carrying
her
out
of
herself.
She
would
not
allow
any
other
anxiety
to
succeed
directly
to
the
place
in
her
mind
which
Harriet
had
occupied.
There
was
a
communication
before
her,
one
which
she
only
could
be
competent
to
make
the
confession
of
her
engagement
to
her
father;
but
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
present.
She
had
resolved
to
defer
the
disclosure
till
Mrs.
Weston
were
safe
and
well.
No
additional
agitation
should
be
thrown
at
this
period
among
those
she
loved
and
the
evil
should
not
act
on
herself
by
anticipation
before
the
appointed
time.
A
fortnight,
at
least,
of
leisure
and
peace
of
mind,
to
crown
every
warmer,
but
more
agitating,
delight,
should
be
hers.
She
soon
resolved,
equally
as
a
duty
and
a
pleasure,
to
employ
