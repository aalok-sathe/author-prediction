left
for
it
to
find
her
out.
She
would
be
respectable
and
happy;
and
Emma
admitted
her
to
be
the
luckiest
creature
in
the
world,
to
have
created
so
steady
and
persevering
an
affection
in
such
a
man;
or,
if
not
quite
the
luckiest,
to
yield
only
to
herself.
Harriet,
necessarily
drawn
away
by
her
engagements
with
the
Martins,
was
less
and
less
at
Hartfield;
which
was
not
to
be
regretted.
The
intimacy
between
her
and
Emma
must
sink;
their
friendship
must
change
into
a
calmer
sort
of
goodwill;
and,
fortunately,
what
ought
to
be,
and
must
be,
seemed
already
beginning,
and
in
the
most
gradual,
natural
manner.
Before
the
end
of
September,
Emma
attended
Harriet
to
church,
and
saw
her
hand
bestowed
on
Robert
Martin
with
so
complete
a
satisfaction,
as
no
remembrances,
even
connected
with
Mr.
Elton
as
he
stood
before
them,
could
impair.
Perhaps,
indeed,
at
that
time
she
scarcely
saw
Mr.
Elton,
but
as
the
clergyman
whose
blessing
at
the
altar
might
next
fall
on
herself.
Robert
Martin
and
Harriet
Smith,
the
latest
couple
engaged
of
the
three,
were
the
first
to
be
married.
Jane
Fairfax
had
already
quitted
Highbury,
and
was
restored
to
the
comforts
