would
be
too
greatly
your
superior
in
situation
to
think
of
you.
Is
not
it
so?"
"Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
believe
me
I
have
not
the
presumption
to
suppose
Indeed
I
am
not
so
mad.
But
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
admire
him
at
a
distance
and
to
think
of
his
infinite
superiority
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world,
with
the
gratitude,
wonder,
and
veneration,
which
are
so
proper,
in
me
especially."
"I
am
not
at
all
surprized
at
you,
Harriet.
The
service
he
rendered
you
was
enough
to
warm
your
heart."
"Service!
oh!
it
was
such
an
inexpressible
obligation!
The
very
recollection
of
it,
and
all
that
I
felt
at
the
time
when
I
saw
him
coming
his
noble
look
and
my
wretchedness
before.
Such
a
change!
In
one
moment
such
a
change!
From
perfect
misery
to
perfect
happiness!"
"It
is
very
natural.
It
is
natural,
and
it
is
honourable.
Yes,
honourable,
I
think,
to
chuse
so
well
and
so
gratefully.
But
that
it
will
be
a
fortunate
preference
is
more
than
I
can
promise.
I
do
not
advise
you
to
give
way
to
it,
Harriet.
I
do
not
by
any
means
engage
for
its
being
returned.
