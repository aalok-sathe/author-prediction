all
probability
have
gained
some
news
of
them.
Mr.
Gardiner
left
Longbourn
on
Sunday;
on
Tuesday
his
wife
received
a
letter
from
him;
it
told
them
that,
on
his
arrival,
he
had
immediately
found
out
his
brother,
and
persuaded
him
to
come
to
Gracechurch
Street;
that
Mr.
Bennet
had
been
to
Epsom
and
Clapham,
before
his
arrival,
but
without
gaining
any
satisfactory
information;
and
that
he
was
now
determined
to
inquire
at
all
the
principal
hotels
in
town,
as
Mr.
Bennet
thought
it
possible
they
might
have
gone
to
one
of
them,
on
their
first
coming
to
London,
before
they
procured
lodgings.
Mr.
Gardiner
himself
did
not
expect
any
success
from
this
measure,
but
as
his
brother
was
eager
in
it,
he
meant
to
assist
him
in
pursuing
it.
He
added
that
Mr.
Bennet
seemed
wholly
disinclined
at
present
to
leave
London
and
promised
to
write
again
very
soon.
There
was
also
a
postscript
to
this
effect:
"I
have
written
to
Colonel
Forster
to
desire
him
to
find
out,
if
possible,
from
some
of
the
young
man's
intimates
in
the
regiment,
whether
Wickham
has
any
relations
or
connections
who
would
be
likely
to
know
in
what
part
of
town
he
