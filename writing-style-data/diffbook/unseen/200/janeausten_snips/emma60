I
do
not
think
her
personally
vain.
Considering
how
very
handsome
she
is,
she
appears
to
be
little
occupied
with
it;
her
vanity
lies
another
way.
Mrs.
Weston,
I
am
not
to
be
talked
out
of
my
dislike
of
Harriet
Smith,
or
my
dread
of
its
doing
them
both
harm."
"And
I,
Mr.
Knightley,
am
equally
stout
in
my
confidence
of
its
not
doing
them
any
harm.
With
all
dear
Emma's
little
faults,
she
is
an
excellent
creature.
Where
shall
we
see
a
better
daughter,
or
a
kinder
sister,
or
a
truer
friend?
No,
no;
she
has
qualities
which
may
be
trusted;
she
will
never
lead
any
one
really
wrong;
she
will
make
no
lasting
blunder;
where
Emma
errs
once,
she
is
in
the
right
a
hundred
times."
"Very
well;
I
will
not
plague
you
any
more.
Emma
shall
be
an
angel,
and
I
will
keep
my
spleen
to
myself
till
Christmas
brings
John
and
Isabella.
John
loves
Emma
with
a
reasonable
and
therefore
not
a
blind
affection,
and
Isabella
always
thinks
as
he
does;
except
when
he
is
not
quite
frightened
enough
about
the
children.
I
am
sure
of
having
their
opinions
with
me."
"I
know
that
you
all
