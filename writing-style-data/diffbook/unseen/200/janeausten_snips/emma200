thing
to
him;
and
gladly
did
he
move
to
those
with
whom
he
was
always
comfortable.
While
he
talked
to
Isabella,
however,
Emma
found
an
opportunity
of
saying,
"And
so
you
do
not
consider
this
visit
from
your
son
as
by
any
means
certain.
I
am
sorry
for
it.
The
introduction
must
be
unpleasant,
whenever
it
takes
place;
and
the
sooner
it
could
be
over,
the
better."
"Yes;
and
every
delay
makes
one
more
apprehensive
of
other
delays.
Even
if
this
family,
the
Braithwaites,
are
put
off,
I
am
still
afraid
that
some
excuse
may
be
found
for
disappointing
us.
I
cannot
bear
to
imagine
any
reluctance
on
his
side;
but
I
am
sure
there
is
a
great
wish
on
the
Churchills'
to
keep
him
to
themselves.
There
is
jealousy.
They
are
jealous
even
of
his
regard
for
his
father.
In
short,
I
can
feel
no
dependence
on
his
coming,
and
I
wish
Mr.
Weston
were
less
sanguine."
"He
ought
to
come,"
said
Emma.
"If
he
could
stay
only
a
couple
of
days,
he
ought
to
come;
and
one
can
hardly
conceive
a
young
man's
not
having
it
in
his
power
to
do
as
much
as
that.
A
young
woman,
