in
doubt
as
to
the
purport
of
your
answer.
I
had
imagined
you
were
consulting
me
only
as
to
the
wording
of
it."
Harriet
was
silent.
With
a
little
reserve
of
manner,
Emma
continued:
"You
mean
to
return
a
favourable
answer,
I
collect."
"No,
I
do
not;
that
is,
I
do
not
mean
What
shall
I
do?
What
would
you
advise
me
to
do?
Pray,
dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
tell
me
what
I
ought
to
do."
"I
shall
not
give
you
any
advice,
Harriet.
I
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
This
is
a
point
which
you
must
settle
with
your
feelings."
"I
had
no
notion
that
he
liked
me
so
very
much,"
said
Harriet,
contemplating
the
letter.
For
a
little
while
Emma
persevered
in
her
silence;
but
beginning
to
apprehend
the
bewitching
flattery
of
that
letter
might
be
too
powerful,
she
thought
it
best
to
say,
"I
lay
it
down
as
a
general
rule,
Harriet,
that
if
a
woman
doubts
as
to
whether
she
should
accept
a
man
or
not,
she
certainly
ought
to
refuse
him.
If
she
can
hesitate
as
to
'Yes,'
she
ought
to
say
'No'
directly.
It
is
not
a
state
to
be
safely
entered
into
