madness!"
Emma
listened,
and
looked,
and
soon
perceived
that
Frank
Churchill's
state
might
be
best
defined
by
the
expressive
phrase
of
being
out
of
humour.
Some
people
were
always
cross
when
they
were
hot.
Such
might
be
his
constitution;
and
as
she
knew
that
eating
and
drinking
were
often
the
cure
of
such
incidental
complaints,
she
recommended
his
taking
some
refreshment;
he
would

not
like
a
man
who
is
so
soon
discomposed
by
a
hot
morning.
Harriet's
sweet
easy
temper
will
not
mind
it."
He
was
gone
long
enough
to
have
had
a
very
comfortable
meal,
and
came
back
all
the
better
grown
quite
cool
and,
with
good
manners,
