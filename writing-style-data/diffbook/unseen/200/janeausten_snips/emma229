life
with
those
she
doated
on,
full
of
their
merits,
blind
to
their
faults,
and
always
innocently
busy,
might
have
been
a
model
of
right
feminine
happiness.
The
evening
of
the
very
day
on
which
they
went
brought
a
note
from
Mr.
Elton
to
Mr.
Woodhouse,
a
long,
civil,
ceremonious
note,
to
say,
with
Mr.
Elton's
best
compliments,
"that
he
was
proposing
to
leave
Highbury
the
following
morning
in
his
way
to
Bath;
where,
in
compliance
with
the
pressing
entreaties
of
some
friends,
he
had
engaged
to
spend
a
few
weeks,
and
very
much
regretted
the
impossibility
he
was
under,
from
various
circumstances
of
weather
and
business,
of
taking
a
personal
leave
of
Mr.
Woodhouse,
of
whose
friendly
civilities
he
should
ever
retain
a
grateful
sense
and
had
Mr.
Woodhouse
any
commands,
should
be
happy
to
attend
to
them."
Emma
was
most
agreeably
surprized.
Mr.
Elton's
absence
just
at
this
time
was
the
very
thing
to
be
desired.
She
admired
him
for
contriving
it,
though
not
able
to
give
him
much
credit
for
the
manner
in
which
it
was
announced.
Resentment
could
not
have
been
more
plainly
spoken
than
in
a
civility
to
her
father,
from
which
she
was
so
