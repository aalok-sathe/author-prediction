to
connexion,
there
Emma
was
perfectly
easy;
persuaded,
that
after
all
his
own
vaunted
claims
and
disdain
of
Harriet,
he
had
done
nothing.
On
that
article,
truth
seemed
attainable.
What
she
was,
must
be
uncertain;
but
who
she
was,
might
be
found
out;
and
setting
aside
the
10,000
l.,
it
did
not
appear
that
she
was
at
all
Harriet's
superior.
She
brought
no
name,
no
blood,
no
alliance.
Miss
Hawkins
was
the
youngest
of
the
two
daughters
of
a
Bristol
merchant,
of
course,
he
must
be
called;
but,
as
the
whole
of
the
profits
of
his
mercantile
life
appeared
so
very
moderate,
it
was
not
unfair
to
guess
the
dignity
of
his
line
of
trade
had
been
very
moderate
also.
Part
of
every
winter
she
had
been
used
to
spend
in
Bath;
but
Bristol
was
her
home,
the
very
heart
of
Bristol;
for
though
the
father
and
mother
had
died
some
years
ago,
an
uncle
remained
in
the
law
line
nothing
more
distinctly
honourable
was
hazarded
of
him,
than
that
he
was
in
the
law
line;
and
with
him
the
daughter
had
lived.
Emma
guessed
him
to
be
the
drudge
of
some
attorney,
and
too
stupid
to
rise.
And
all
