Oh!
she
is
absolutely
charming!
You
will
laugh
at
my
warmth
but,
upon
my
word,
I
talk
of
nothing
but
Jane
Fairfax.
And
her
situation
is
so
calculated
to
affect
one!
Miss
Woodhouse,
we
must
exert
ourselves
and

"Oh!
but
dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
she
is
now
in
such
retirement,
such
obscurity,
so
thrown
away.
Whatever
advantages
she
may
