convinced
of
Harriet
Smith's
being
exactly
the
young
friend
she
wanted
exactly
the
something
which
her
home
required.
Such
a
friend
as
Mrs.
Weston
was
out
of
the
question.
Two
such
could
never
be
granted.
Two
such
she
did
not
want.
It
was
quite
a
different
sort
of
thing,
a
sentiment
distinct
and
independent.
Mrs.
Weston
was
the
object
of
a
regard
which
had
its
basis
in
gratitude
and
esteem.
Harriet
would
be
loved
as
one
to
whom
she
could
be
useful.
For
Mrs.
Weston
there
was
nothing
to
be
done;
for
Harriet
every
thing.
Her
first
attempts
at
usefulness
were
in
an
endeavour
to
find
out
who
were
the
parents,
but
Harriet
could
not
tell.
She
was
ready
to
tell
every
thing
in
her
power,
but
on
this
subject
questions
were
vain.
Emma
was
obliged
to
fancy
what
she
liked
but
she
could
never
believe
that
in
the
same
situation
she
should
not
have
discovered
the
truth.
Harriet
had
no
penetration.
She
had
been
satisfied
to
hear
and
believe
just
what
Mrs.
Goddard
chose
to
tell
her;
and
looked
no
farther.
Mrs.
Goddard,
and
the
teachers,
and
the
girls
and
the
affairs
of
the
school
in
general,
formed
