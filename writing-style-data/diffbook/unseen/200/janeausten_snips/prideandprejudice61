indeed,
and
suffers
a
vast
deal,
though
with
the
greatest
patience
in
the
world,
which
is
always
the
way
with
her,
for
she
has,
without
exception,
the
sweetest
temper
I
have
ever
met
with.
I
often
tell
my
other
girls
they
are
nothing
to
her.
You
have
a
sweet
room
here,
Mr.
Bingley,
and
a
charming
prospect
over
the
gravel
walk.
I
do
not
know
a
place
in
the
country
that
is
equal
to
Netherfield.
You
will
not
think
of
quitting
it
in
a
hurry,
I
hope,
though
you
have
but
a
short
lease."
"Whatever
I
do
is
done
in
a

replied
he;
"and
therefore
if
I
should
resolve
to
quit
Netherfield,
I
should
probably
be
off
in
five
minutes.
At
present,
however,
I
consider
myself
as
quite
fixed
here."
"That
is
exactly
what
I
should
have
supposed
of
you,"
said
Elizabeth.
"You
begin
to
comprehend
me,
do
you?"
cried
he,
turning
towards
her.
"Oh!
yes
I
understand
you
perfectly."
"I
wish
I
might
take
this
for
a
compliment;
but
to
be
so
easily
seen
through
I
am
afraid
is
pitiful."
"That
is
as
it
happens.
It
does
not
follow
that
a
deep,
intricate
character
is
more
or
less
