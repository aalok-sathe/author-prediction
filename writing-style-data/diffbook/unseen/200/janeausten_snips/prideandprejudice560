Elizabeth,
"if
your
nephew
does
not
object
to
them,
they
can
be
nothing
to
you."
"Tell
me
once
for
all,
are
you
engaged
to
him?"
Though
Elizabeth
would
not,
for
the
mere
purpose
of
obliging
Lady
Catherine,
have
answered
this
question,
she
could
not
but
say,
after
a
moment's
deliberation:
"I
am
not."
Lady
Catherine
seemed
pleased.
"And
will
you
promise
me,
never
to
enter
into
such
an
engagement?"
"I
will
make
no
promise
of
the
kind."
"Miss
Bennet
I
am
shocked
and
astonished.
I
expected
to
find
a
more
reasonable
young
woman.
But
do
not
deceive
yourself
into
a
belief
that
I
will
ever
recede.
I
shall
not
go
away
till
you
have
given
me
the
assurance
I
require."
"And
I
certainly
never
shall
give
it.
I
am
not
to
be
intimidated
into
anything
so
wholly
unreasonable.
Your
ladyship
wants
Mr.
Darcy
to
marry
your
daughter;
but
would
my
giving
you
the
wished
for
promise
make
their
marriage
at
all
more
probable?
Supposing
him
to
be
attached
to
me,
would
my
refusing
to
accept
his
hand
make
him
wish
to
bestow
it
on
his
cousin?
Allow
me
to
say,
Lady
Catherine,
that
the
arguments
with
which
you
have
supported
