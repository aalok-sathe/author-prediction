rejected
and
mortified
disappointed
in
a
very
sanguine
hope,
after
a
series
of
what
appeared
to
him
strong
encouragement;
and
not
only
losing
the
right
lady,
but
finding
himself
debased
to
the
level
of
a
very
wrong
one.
He
had
gone
away
deeply
offended
he
came
back
engaged
to
another
and
to
another
as
superior,
of

to
the
first,

had
gained
a
woman
of
10,000
l.
or
thereabouts;
and
he
had
gained
her
with
such
delightful
rapidity
the
first
hour
of
introduction
had
been
so
very
soon
followed
by
distinguishing
notice;
the
history
which
he
had
to
give
Mrs.
Cole
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
affair
was
so
glorious
