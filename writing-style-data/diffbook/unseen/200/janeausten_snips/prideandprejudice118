I
might
say
in
any
house
in
the
neighbourhood,
except
Netherfield.
He
is
not
at
all
liked
in
Hertfordshire.
Everybody
is
disgusted
with
his
pride.
You
will
not
find
him
more
favourably
spoken
of
by
anyone."
"I
cannot
pretend
to
be
sorry,"
said
Wickham,
after
a
short
interruption,
"that
he
or
that
any
man
should
not

estimated
beyond

with
him
I

be
in

"I
do
not
at

but
I
heard
nothing
of
his
going
away
when
I
was
at
Netherfield.
I
hope
your
plans
in
favour
of
the
shire
will
not
be
affected
by
his
being
in
the
neighbourhood."
"Oh!
no
it
is
not
for
me
to
be
driven
away
by
Mr.
Darcy.
If
he
wishes

avoid
seeing
me,
