habit
of
regard
for
every
old
acquaintance.
Mr.
John
Knightley
was
a
tall,
gentleman
like,
and
very
clever
man;
rising
in
his
profession,
domestic,
and
respectable
in
his
private
character;
but
with
reserved
manners
which
prevented
his
being
generally
pleasing;
and
capable
of
being
sometimes
out
of
humour.
He
was
not
an
ill
tempered
man,
not
so
often
unreasonably
cross
as
to
deserve
such
a
reproach;
but
his
temper
was
not
his
great
perfection;
and,
indeed,
with
such
a
worshipping
wife,
it
was
hardly
possible
that
any
natural
defects
in
it
should
not
be
increased.
The
extreme
sweetness
of
her
temper
must
hurt
his.
He
had
all
the
clearness
and
quickness
of
mind
which
she
wanted,
and
he
could
sometimes
act
an
ungracious,
or
say
a
severe
thing.
He
was
not
a
great
favourite
with
his
fair
sister
in
law.
Nothing
wrong
in
him
escaped
her.
She
was
quick
in
feeling
the
little
injuries
to
Isabella,
which
Isabella
never
felt
herself.
Perhaps
she
might
have
passed
over
more
had
his
manners
been
flattering
to
Isabella's
sister,
but
they
were
only
those
of
a
calmly
kind
brother
and
friend,
without
praise
and
without
blindness;
but
hardly
any
degree
of
personal
compliment
