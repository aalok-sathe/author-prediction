takes
up
a
notion,
and
runs
away
with
it.
Mr.
Dixon,
you
say,
is
not,
strictly
speaking,
handsome?"
"Handsome!
Oh!
no
far
from
it
certainly
plain.
I
told
you
he
was
plain."
"My
dear,
you
said
that
Miss
Campbell
would
not
allow
him
to
be
plain,
and
that
you
yourself
"
"Oh!
as
for
me,
my
judgment
is
worth
nothing.
Where
I
have
a
regard,
I
always
think
a
person
well
looking.
But
I
gave
what
I
believed
the
general
opinion,
when
I
called
him
plain."
"Well,
my
dear
Jane,
I
believe
we
must
be
running
away.
The
weather
does
not
look
well,
and
grandmama
will
be
uneasy.
You
are
too
obliging,
my
dear
Miss
Woodhouse;
but
we
really
must
take
leave.
This
has
been
a
most
agreeable
piece
of
news
indeed.
I
shall
just
go
round
by
Mrs.
Cole's;
but
I
shall
not
stop
three
minutes:
and,
Jane,
you
had
better
go
home
directly
I
would
not
have
you
out
in
a
shower!
We
think
she
is
the
better
for
Highbury
already.
Thank
you,
we
do
indeed.
I
shall
not
attempt
calling
on
Mrs.
Goddard,
for
I
really
do
not
think
she
cares
for
any
thing
but
boiled
pork:
