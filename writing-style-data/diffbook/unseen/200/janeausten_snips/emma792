They
met
readily
and
smiling,
but
with
a
consciousness
which
at
first
allowed
little
to
be
said;
and
having
all
sat
down
again,
there
was
for
some
time
such
a
blank
in
the
circle,
that
Emma
began
to
doubt
whether
the
wish
now
indulged,
which
she
had
long
felt,
of
seeing
Frank
Churchill
once
more,
and
