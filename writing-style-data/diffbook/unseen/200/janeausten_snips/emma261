out,
quite
frightened,
with
'Bless
me!
poor
Jane
is
ill!'
which
my
mother,
being
on
the
watch,
heard
distinctly,
and
was
sadly
alarmed
at.
However,
when
I
read
on,
I
found
it
was
not
near
so
bad
as
I
had
fancied
at
first;
and
I
make
so

of
it
now
to
her,
that
she
does

But
I
cannot

could
be
so

his
time.
Well,
now
I
have
just
given
you
a
hint
of
what
Jane
writes
about,
we
will
turn
to
her
letter,
and
I
am
sure
she
tells
her
own
story
a
great
deal
better
than
I
can
tell
