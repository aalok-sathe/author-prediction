It
was
but
an
effusion
of
lively
spirits.
At
last
he
was
persuaded
to
move
on
from
the
front
of
the
Crown;
and
being
now
almost
facing
the
house
where
the
Bateses
lodged,
Emma
recollected
his
intended
visit
the
day
before,
and
asked
him
if
he
had
paid
it.
"Yes,
oh!
yes"
he
replied;
"I
was
just
going
to
mention
it.
A
very
successful
visit:
I
saw
all
the
three
ladies;
and

and,
to
my
utter
astonishment,
I
found,
when
he
(finding
me
nowhere
else)
joined
me
there
at
last,
that
I
had
been
actually
sitting
with
them
very
nearly
three
quarters
of
an
hour.
The
good
lady
had
not
given
me
the
possibility
of
escape
