severe
one
it
was.
She
had
to
destroy
all
the
hopes
which
she
had
been
so
industriously
feeding
to
appear
in
the
ungracious
character
of
the
one
preferred
and
acknowledge
herself
grossly
mistaken
and
mis
judging
in
all
her
ideas
on
one
subject,
all
her
observations,
all
her
convictions,
all
her
prophecies
for
the
last
six
weeks.
The
confession
completely
renewed
her
first
shame
and
the
sight
of
Harriet's
tears
made
her
think
that
she
should
never
be
in
charity
with
herself
again.
Harriet
bore
the
intelligence
very
well
blaming
nobody
and
in
every
thing
testifying
such
an
ingenuousness
of
disposition
and
lowly
opinion
of
herself,
as
must
appear
with
particular
advantage
at
that
moment
to
her
friend.
Emma
was
in
the
humour
to
value
simplicity
and
modesty
to
the
utmost;
and
all
that
was
amiable,
all
that
ought
to
be
attaching,
seemed
on
Harriet's
side,
not
her
own.
Harriet
did
not
consider
herself
as
having
any
thing
to
complain
of.
The
affection
of
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Elton
would
have
been
too
great
a
distinction.
She
never
could
have
deserved
him
and
nobody
but
so
partial
and
kind
a
friend
as
Miss
Woodhouse
would
have
thought
it
possible.
