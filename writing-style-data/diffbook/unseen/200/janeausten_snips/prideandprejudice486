benefited
by
it.
She
wanted
to
hear
of
him,
when
there
seemed
the
least
chance
of
gaining
intelligence.
She
was
convinced
that
she
could
have
been
happy
with
him,
when
it
was
no
longer
likely
they
should
meet.
What
a
triumph
for
him,
as
she
often
thought,
could
he
know
that
the
proposals
which
she
had
proudly
spurned
only
four
months
ago,
would
now
have
been
most
gladly
and
gratefully
received!
He
was
as
generous,
she
doubted
not,
as
the
most
generous
of
his
sex;
but
while
he
was
mortal,
there
must
be
a
triumph.
She
began
now
to
comprehend
that
he
was
exactly
the
man
who,
in
disposition
and
talents,
would
most
suit
her.
His
understanding
and
temper,
though
unlike
her
own,
would
have
answered
all
her
wishes.
It
was
an
union
that
must
have
been
to
the
advantage
of
both;
by
her
ease
and
liveliness,
his
mind
might
have
been
softened,
his
manners
improved;
and
from
his
judgement,
information,
and
knowledge
of
the
world,
she
must
have
received
benefit
of
greater
importance.
But
no
such
happy
marriage
could
now
teach
the
admiring
multitude
what
connubial
felicity
really
was.
An
union
of
a
different
tendency,
and
precluding
the
possibility
