the
valley,
the
opposite
hills,
with
the
long
range
of
woods
overspreading
many,
and
occasionally
part
of
the
stream.
Mr.
Gardiner
expressed
a
wish
of
going
round
the
whole
park,
but
feared
it
might
be
beyond
a
walk.
With
a
triumphant
smile
they
were
told
that
it
was
ten
miles
round.
It
settled
the
matter;
and
they
pursued
the
accustomed
circuit;
which
brought
them
again,
after
some
time,
in
a
descent
among
hanging
woods,
to
the
edge
of
the
water,
and
one
of
its
narrowest
parts.
They
crossed
it
by
a
simple
bridge,
in
character
with
the
general
air
of
the
scene;
it
was
a
spot
less
adorned
than
any
they
had
yet
visited;
and
the
valley,
here
contracted
into
a
glen,
allowed
room
only
for
the
stream,
and
a
narrow
walk
amidst
the
rough
coppice
wood
which
bordered
it.
Elizabeth
longed
to
explore
its
windings;
but
when
they
had
crossed
the
bridge,
and
perceived
their
distance
from
the
house,
Mrs.
Gardiner,
who
was
not
a
great
walker,
could
go
no
farther,
and
thought
only
of
returning
to
the
carriage
as
quickly
as
possible.
Her
niece
was,
therefore,
obliged
to
submit,
and
they
took
their
way
towards
the
house
on
