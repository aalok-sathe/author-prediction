blessing!
My
mother's
are
really
very
good
indeed.
Jane
often
says,
when
she
is
here,
'I
am
sure,
grandmama,
you
must
have
had
very
strong
eyes
to
see
as
you
do
and
so
much
fine
work
as
you
have
done
too!
I
only
wish
my
eyes
may
last
me
as
well.'"
All
this
spoken
extremely
fast
obliged
Miss
Bates
to
stop
for
breath;
and
Emma
said
something
very
civil
about
the
excellence
of
Miss
Fairfax's
handwriting.
"You
are
extremely
kind,"
replied
Miss
Bates,
highly
gratified;
"you

are
such

there
is
nobody's
praise
that

Miss
Woodhouse's.
My
mother
does
not

she
is
a
little
deaf
you
know.
Ma'am,"
addressing
her,
"do
you
hear
what
Miss
Woodhouse
is
so
obliging
to
say
about
Jane's
handwriting?"
And
Emma
had
the
advantage
of
hearing
her
own
silly
compliment
repeated
twice
over
before
the
good
old
lady
could
comprehend
it.
She
was
pondering,
in
the
meanwhile,
upon
the
possibility,
without
seeming
very
rude,
of
making
her
escape
from
Jane
Fairfax's
letter,
and
had
almost
resolved
on
hurrying
away
directly
under
some
slight
excuse,
when
Miss
Bates
