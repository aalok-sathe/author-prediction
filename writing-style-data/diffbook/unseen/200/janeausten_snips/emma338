friendly,
liberal,
and
unpretending;
but,
on
the
other
hand,
they
were
of
low
origin,
in
trade,
and
only
moderately
genteel.
On
their
first
coming
into
the
country,
they
had
lived
in
proportion
to
their
income,
quietly,
keeping
little
company,
and
that
little
unexpensively;
but
the
last
year
or
two
had
brought
them
a
considerable
increase
of
means
the
house
in
town
had
yielded
greater
profits,
and
fortune
in
general
had
smiled
on
them.
With
their
wealth,
their
views
increased;
their
want
of
a
larger
house,

inclination
for
more

They
added
to

and
by
this
time
were,
in
fortune
and
style
of

the
family
at
Hartfield.
Their
love
of
society,
and
their
new
dining
room,
prepared
every
body
for
their
keeping
dinner
company;
and
a
few
parties,
chiefly
among
the
single
men,
had
already
taken
place.
The
regular
and
best
families
Emma
could
hardly
suppose
they
would
presume
to
invite
neither
Donwell,
nor
Hartfield,
nor
Randalls.
Nothing
should
tempt
her
to
go,
if
they
did;
and
she
regretted
that
her
father's
known
habits
would
be
giving
her
refusal
less
meaning
than
