do,
because
she
will

The
Coxes
were
wondering
last
night
whether
she
would
get
into
any
great
family.
How
did
you
think
the
Coxes
looked?"
"Just
as
they
always
do
very
vulgar."
"They
told
me
something,"
said
Harriet
rather
hesitatingly;
"but
it
is
nothing
of
any
consequence."
Emma
was
obliged
to
ask
what
they
had
told
her,
though

Mr.
Elton.
"They
told
me

I
thought
I

Anne
Cox
should
be."
"She
said
he
was
very
agreeable
the
day
he
dined
there.
He
sat
by
her
at
dinner.
Miss
Nash
thinks
either
of
the
Coxes
would
be
very
glad
to
marry
him."
"Very
likely.
I
think
they
are,
without
exception,
the
most
vulgar
girls
in
Highbury."
