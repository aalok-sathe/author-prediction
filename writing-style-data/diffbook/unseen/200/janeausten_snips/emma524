before
any
other
persons
came,
that
she
could
not
refuse
him,
and
must
therefore
spend
some
quiet
interval
in
the
young
man's
company.
She
was
to
convey
Harriet,
and
they
drove
to
the
Crown
in
good
time,
the
Randalls
party
just
sufficiently
before
them.
Frank
Churchill
seemed
to
have
been
on
the
watch;
and
though
he
did
not
say
much,
his
eyes
declared
that
he
meant
to
have
a
delightful
evening.
They
all
walked
about
together,
to
see
that
every
thing
was
as
it
should
be;
and
within
a
few
minutes
were
joined
by
the
contents
of
another
carriage,
which
Emma
could
not
hear
the
sound
of
at
first,
without
great
surprize.
"So
unreasonably
early!"
she
was
going
to
exclaim;
but
she
presently
found
that
it
was
a
family
of
old
friends,
who
were
coming,
like
herself,
by
particular
desire,
to
help
Mr.
Weston's
judgment;
and
they
were
so
very
closely
followed
by
another
carriage
of
cousins,
who
had
been
entreated
to
come
early
with
the
same
distinguishing
earnestness,
on
the
same
errand,
that
it
seemed
as
if
half
the
company
might
soon
be
collected
together
for
the
purpose
of
preparatory
inspection.
Emma
perceived
that
her
taste
was
not
the
