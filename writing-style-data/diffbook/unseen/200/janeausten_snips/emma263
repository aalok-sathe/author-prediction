property,
the
charge,
the
consolation,
the
foundling
of
her
grandmother
and
aunt,
there
had
seemed
every
probability
of
her
being
permanently
fixed
there;
of
her
being
taught
only
what
very
limited
means
could
command,
and
growing
up
with
no
advantages
of
connexion
or
improvement,
to
be
engrafted
on
what
nature
had
given
her
in
a
pleasing
person,
good
understanding,
and
warm
hearted,
well
meaning
relations.
But
the
compassionate
feelings
of
a
friend
of
her
father
gave
a
change
to
her
destiny.
This
was
Colonel
Campbell,
who
had
very
highly
regarded
Fairfax,
as
an
excellent
officer
and
most
deserving
young
man;
and
farther,
had
been
indebted
to
him
for
such
attentions,
during
a
severe
camp
fever,
as
he
believed
had
saved
his
life.
These
were
claims
which
he
did
not
learn
to
overlook,
though
some
years
passed
away
from
the
death
of
poor
Fairfax,
before
his
own
return
to
England
put
any
thing
in
his
power.
When
he
did
return,
he
sought
out
the
child
and
took
notice
of
her.
He
was
a
married
man,
with
only
one
living
child,
a
girl,
about
Jane's
age:
and
Jane
became
their
guest,
paying
them
long
visits
and
growing
a
favourite
with
all;
and
