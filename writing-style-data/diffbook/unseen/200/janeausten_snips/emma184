their
way
down,
and
the
sky
had
the
appearance
of
being
so
overcharged
as
to
want
only
a
milder
air
to
produce
a
very
white
world
in
a
very
short
time.
Emma
soon
saw
that
her
companion
was
not
in
the
happiest
humour.
The
preparing
and
the
going
abroad
in
such
weather,
with
the
sacrifice
of
his
children
after
dinner,
were
evils,
were
disagreeables
at
least,
which
Mr.
John
Knightley
did
not
by
any
means
like;
he
anticipated
nothing
in
the
visit
that
could
be
at
all
worth
the
purchase;
and
the
whole
of
their
drive
to
the
vicarage
was
spent
by
him
in
expressing
his
discontent.
"A
man,"
said
he,
"must
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
himself
when
he
asks
people
to
leave
their
own
fireside,
and
encounter
such
a
day
as
this,
for
the
sake
of
coming
to
see
him.
He
must
think
himself
a
most
agreeable
fellow;
I
could
not
do
such
a
thing.
It
is
the
greatest
absurdity
Actually
snowing
at
this
moment!
The
folly
of
not
allowing
people
to
be
comfortable
at
home
and
the
folly
of
people's
not
staying
comfortably
at
home
when
they
can!
If
we
were
obliged
to
go
out
such
