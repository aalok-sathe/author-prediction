day
to
this,
I
never
mentioned
it
to
a
soul
that
I
know
of.
At
the
same
time,
I
will
not
positively
answer
for
my
having
never
dropt
a
hint,
because
I
know
I
do
sometimes
pop
out
a
thing
before
I
am
aware.
I
am
a
talker,
you
know;
I
am
rather
a
talker;
and
now
and
then
I
have
let
a
thing
escape
me
which
I
should
not.
I
am
not
like
Jane;
I
wish
I
were.
I
will
answer
for
it
she
never
betrayed
the
least
thing
in
the
world.
Where
is
she?
Oh!
just
behind.
Perfectly
remember
Mrs.
Perry's
coming.
Extraordinary
dream,
indeed!"
They
were
entering
the
hall.
Mr.
Knightley's
eyes
had
preceded
Miss
Bates's
in
a
glance
at
Jane.
From
Frank
Churchill's
face,
where
he
thought
he
saw
confusion
suppressed
or
laughed
away,
he
had
involuntarily
turned
to
hers;
but
she
was
indeed
behind,
and
too
busy
with
her
shawl.
Mr.
Weston
had
walked
in.
The
two
other
gentlemen
waited
at
the
door
to
let
her
pass.
Mr.
Knightley
suspected
in
Frank
Churchill
the
determination
of
catching
her
eye
he
seemed
watching
her
intently
in
vain,
however,
if
it
were
so
Jane
passed
between
them
