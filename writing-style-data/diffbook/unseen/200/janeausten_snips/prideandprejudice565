to
feel
that
the
marriage
of
her
sister
must
bring
them
more
frequently
together.
And
her
neighbours
at
Lucas
Lodge,
therefore
(for
through
their
communication
with
the
Collinses,
the
report,
she
concluded,
had
reached
Lady
Catherine),
had
only
set
that
down
as
almost
certain
and
immediate,
which
she
had
looked
forward
to
as
possible
at
some
future
time.
In
revolving
Lady
Catherine's
expressions,
however,
she
could
not
help
feeling
some
uneasiness
as
to
the
possible
consequence
of
her
persisting
in
this
interference.
From
what
she
had
said
of
her
resolution
to
prevent
their
marriage,
it
occurred
to
Elizabeth
that
she
must
meditate
an
application
to
her
nephew;
and
how
he
might
take
a
similar
representation
of
the
evils
attached
to
a
connection
with
her,
she
dared
not
pronounce.
She
knew
not
the
exact
degree
of
his
affection
for
his
aunt,
or
his
dependence
on
her
judgment,
but
it
was
natural
to
suppose
that
he
thought
much
higher
of
her
ladyship
than
she
could
do;
and
it
was
certain
that,
in
enumerating
the
miseries
of
a
marriage
with
one,
whose
immediate
connections
were
so
unequal
to
his
own,
his
aunt
would
address
him
on
his
weakest
side.
With
his
notions
of
