and
so
we
breakfasted
at
ten
as
usual;
I
thought
it
would
never
be
over;
for,
by
the
bye,
you
are
to
understand,
that
my
uncle
and
aunt
were
horrid
unpleasant
all
the
time
I
was
with
them.
If
you'll
believe
me,
I
did
not
once
put
my
foot
out
of
doors,
though
I
was
there
a
fortnight.
Not

we
were
beyond
the
hour,
we
could
not
be
married
all

But,
luckily,
he
came
back
again
in
ten
minutes'
time,
and
then
we
all
set
out.
However,
I
recollected
afterwards
that
if
he
had
been
prevented
going,
the
wedding
need
not
be
