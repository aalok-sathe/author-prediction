"My
father
will
be
expecting
us.
I
had
no
intention,
I
thought
I
had
no
power
of
staying
more
than
five
minutes,
when
I
first
entered
the
house.
I
merely
called,
because
I
would
not
pass
the
door
without
inquiring
after
Mrs.
Bates;
but
I

could
be
urged
to
detain
her

She
regained

youngest
daughter.
The

of
Lieut.
Fairfax
of
the
regiment
of
infantry,
and
Miss
Jane
Bates,
had
had
its
day
of
fame
and
pleasure,
hope
and
interest;
but
nothing
now
remained
of
it,
save
the
melancholy
remembrance
of
him
dying
in
action
abroad
of
his
widow
sinking
under
consumption
and
grief
soon
afterwards
and
this
girl.
By

on
losing

she
