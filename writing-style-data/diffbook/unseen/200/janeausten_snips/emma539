up
with
an
old
friend
like
Mrs.
Gilbert."
"Mrs.
Gilbert
does
not
mean
to
dance,
but
there
is
a
young
lady
disengaged
whom
I
should
be
very
glad
to
see
dancing
Miss
Smith."
"Miss
Smith!
oh!
I
had
not
observed.
You
are
extremely
obliging
and
if
I
were
not
an
old
married
man.
But
my
dancing
days
are
over,
Mrs.
Weston.
You
will
excuse
me.
Any
thing
else
I
should
be
most
happy
to
do,
at
your
command
but
my
dancing
days
are
over."
Mrs.
Weston
said
no
more;
and
Emma
could
imagine
with
what
surprize
and
mortification
she
must
be
returning
to
her
seat.
This
was
Mr.
Elton!
the
amiable,
obliging,
gentle
Mr.
Elton.
She
looked
round
for
a
moment;
he
had
joined
Mr.
Knightley
at
a
little
distance,
and
was
arranging
himself
for
settled
conversation,
while
smiles
of
high
glee
passed
between
him
and
his
wife.
She
would
not
look
again.
Her
heart
was
in
a
glow,
and
she
feared
her
face
might
be
as
hot.
In
another
moment
a
happier
sight
caught
her;
Mr.
Knightley
leading
Harriet
to
the
set!
Never
had
she
been
more
surprized,
seldom
more
delighted,
than
at
that
instant.
She
was
all
pleasure
