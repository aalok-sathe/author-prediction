breeding.
I
cannot
imagine
that
she
will
not
be
continually
insulting
her
visitor
with
praise,
encouragement,
and
offers
of
service;
that
she
will
not
be
continually
detailing
her
magnificent
intentions,
from
the
procuring
her
a
permanent
situation
to
the
including
her
in
those
delightful
exploring
parties
which
are
to
take
place
in
the
barouche
landau."
"Jane
Fairfax
has
feeling,"
said
Mr.
Knightley
"I
do
not
accuse
her
of
want
of
feeling.
Her
sensibilities,
I
suspect,
are
strong
and
her
temper
excellent
in
its
power
of
forbearance,
patience,
self
control;
but
it
wants
openness.
She
is
reserved,
more
reserved,
I
think,
than
she
used
to
be
And
I
love
an
open
temper.
No

Cole
alluded

attachment,

I
saw
Jane
Fairfax
and
conversed
with
her,
with
admiration
and
pleasure
always
but
with
no
thought
beyond."
"Well,
Mrs.
Weston,"
said
Emma
triumphantly
when
he
left
them,
"what
do
you
say
now
to
Mr.
Knightley's
marrying
Jane
Fairfax?"
"Why,
really,
dear
Emma,
I
say
that
he
is
so
very
much
occupied
by
the
idea
of
not
being
in
love
with
her,
that
I
should
not
wonder
if
it
were
to
end
