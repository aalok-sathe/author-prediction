as
your
friend.
If
she
has
fancied
otherwise,
her
own
wishes
have
misled
her,
and
I
am
very
sorry
extremely
sorry
But,
Miss
Smith,
indeed!
Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse!
who
can
think
of
Miss
Smith,
when
Miss
Woodhouse
is
near!
No,
upon
my
honour,
there
is
no
unsteadiness
of
character.
I
have
thought
only
of
you.
I
protest
against
having
paid
the
smallest
attention
to
any
one
else.
Every
thing
that
I
have
said
or
done,
for
many
weeks

sole

of
marking
my
adoration
of
yourself.

cannot
really,
seriously,
doubt
it.
No!
(in
an
accent
meant
to
be
insinuating)

am
sure
you
have
seen
and
understood
me."

She
was
too
completely
overpowered
to
be
immediately
able
to
reply:
and
two
moments
of
silence
being
ample
encouragement
for
Mr.
Elton's
sanguine
state
of
mind,
he
tried
to
take
her
hand
again,
as
he
joyously
exclaimed
"Charming
Miss
Woodhouse!
allow
me
to
interpret
this
interesting
silence.
It
confesses
that
you
have
long
understood
me."
"No,
sir,"
cried
Emma,
"it
confesses
no
such
thing.
So
far
