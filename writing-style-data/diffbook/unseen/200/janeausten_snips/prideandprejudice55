the
beauties
of
that
noble
place.
Charles,
when
you
build
your
house,
I
wish
it
may
be
half
as
delightful
as
Pemberley."
"I
wish
it
may."
"But
I
would
really
advise
you
to
make
your
purchase
in
that
neighbourhood,
and
take
Pemberley
for
a
kind
of
model.
There
is
not
a
finer
county
in
England
than
Derbyshire."
"With
all
my
heart;
I
will
buy
Pemberley
itself
if
Darcy
will
sell
it."
"I
am
talking
of
possibilities,
Charles."
"Upon
my
word,
Caroline,
I
should
think
it
more
possible
to
get
Pemberley
by
purchase
than
by
imitation."
Elizabeth
was
so
much
caught
with
what
passed,
as
to
leave
her
very
little
attention
for
her
book;
and
soon
laying
it
wholly
aside,
she
drew
near
the
card
table,
and
stationed
herself
between
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
eldest
sister,
to
observe
the
game.
"Is
Miss
Darcy
much
grown
since
the
spring?"
said
Miss
Bingley;
"will
she
be
as
tall
as
I
am?"
"I
think
she
will.
She
is
now
about
Miss
Elizabeth
Bennet's
height,
or
rather
taller."
"How
I
long
to
see
her
again!
I
never
met
with
anybody
who
delighted
me
so
much.
Such
a
countenance,
such
manners!
And
so
extremely
accomplished
for
