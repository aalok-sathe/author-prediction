I
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
you
could
forget
what
passed
in
this
very
room
about
court
plaister,
one
of
the
very
last
times
we
ever
met
in
it!
It
was
but
a
very
few
days
before
I
had
my
sore
throat
just
before
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Knightley
came
I
think
the
very
evening.
Do
not
you
remember
his
cutting
his
finger
with
your
new
penknife,
and
your
recommending
court
plaister?
But,
as
you
had
none
about
you,
and
knew
I
had,
you
desired
me
to
supply
him;
and
so
I
took
mine
out
and
cut
him
a
piece;
but
it
was
a
great
deal
too
large,
and
he
cut
it
smaller,
and
kept
playing
some
time
with
what
was
left,
before
he
gave
it
back
to
me.
And
so
then,
in
my
nonsense,
I
could
not
help
making
a
treasure
of
it
so
I
put
it
by
never
to
be
used,
and
looked
at
it
now
and
then
as
a
great
treat."
"My
dearest
Harriet!"
cried
Emma,
putting
her
hand
before
her
face,
and
jumping
up,
"you
make
me
more
ashamed
of
myself
than
I
can
bear.
Remember
it?
Aye,
I
remember
it
all
now;
all,
except
