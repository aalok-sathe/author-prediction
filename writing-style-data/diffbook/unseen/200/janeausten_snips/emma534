from
a
frown
to
a
smile
"No,
do
not
tell
me
I
do
not
want
to
know
what
you
mean.
Where
is
my
father?
When
are
we
to
begin
dancing?"
Emma
could
hardly
understand
him;
he
seemed
in
an
odd
humour.
He
walked
off
to
find
his
father,
but
was
quickly
back
again
with
both
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston.
He
had
met
with
them
in
a
little
perplexity,
which
must
be
laid
before
Emma.
It
had
just
occurred
to
Mrs.
Weston
that
Mrs.
Elton
must
be
asked
to
begin
the
ball;
that
she
would
expect
it;
which
interfered
with
all
their
wishes
of
giving
Emma
that
distinction.
Emma
heard
the
sad
truth
with
fortitude.
"And
what
are
we
to
do
for
a
proper
partner
for
her?"
said
Mr.
Weston.
"She
will
think
Frank
ought
to
ask
her."
Frank
turned
instantly
to
Emma,
to
claim
her
former
promise;
and
boasted
himself
an
engaged
man,
which
his
father
looked
his
most
perfect
approbation
of
and
it
then
appeared
that
Mrs.
Weston
was
wanting
him
to
dance
with
Mrs.
Elton
himself,
and
that
their
business
was
to
help
to
persuade
him
into
it,
which
was
done
pretty
soon.
Mr.
Weston
and
Mrs.
Elton
