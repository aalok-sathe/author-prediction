marry."
Emma
had
done.
Her
father
was
growing
nervous,
and
could
not
understand
her.
Her
mind
returned
to
Mrs.
Elton's
offences,
and
long,
very
long,
did
they
occupy
her.
Emma
was
not
required,
by
any
subsequent
discovery,
to
retract
her
ill
opinion
of
Mrs.
Elton.
Her
observation
had
been
pretty
correct.
Such
as
Mrs.
Elton
appeared
to
her
on
this
second
interview,
such
she
appeared
whenever
they
met
again,
self
important,
presuming,
familiar,
ignorant,
and
ill
bred.
She
had
a
little
beauty
and
a
little
accomplishment,
but
so
little
judgment
that
she
thought
herself
coming
with
superior
knowledge
of
the
world,
to
enliven
and
improve
a
country
neighbourhood;
and
conceived
Miss
Hawkins
to
have
held
such
a
place
in
society
as
Mrs.
Elton's
consequence
only
could
surpass.
There
was
no
reason
to
suppose
Mr.
Elton
thought
at
all
differently
from
his
wife.
He
seemed
not
merely
happy
with
her,
but
proud.
He
had
the
air
of
congratulating
himself
on
having
brought
such
a
woman
to
Highbury,
as
not
even
Miss
Woodhouse
could
equal;
and
the
greater
part
of
her
new
acquaintance,
disposed
to
commend,
or
not
in
the
habit
of
judging,
following
the
lead
of
Miss
Bates's
good
will,
or
