to
feel
that
the
first
meeting
was
over,
and
to
give
her
the
impression
of
his
not
being
improved
by
the
mixture
of
pique
and
pretension,
now
spread
over
his
air.
She
was,
in
fact,
beginning
very
much
to
wonder
that
she
had
ever
thought
him
pleasing
at
all;
and
his
sight
was
so
inseparably
connected
with
some
very
disagreeable
feelings,
that,
except
in
a
moral
light,
as
a
penance,
a
lesson,
a
source
of
profitable
humiliation
to
her
own
mind,
she
would
have
been
thankful
to
be
assured
of
never
seeing
him
again.
She
wished
him
very
well;
but
he
gave
her
pain,
and
his
welfare
twenty
miles
off
would
administer
most
satisfaction.
The
pain
of
his
continued
residence
in
Highbury,
however,
must
certainly
be
lessened
by
his
marriage.
Many
vain
solicitudes
would
be
prevented
many
awkwardnesses
smoothed
by
it.
A
Mrs.
Elton
would
be
an
excuse
for
any
change
of
intercourse;
former
intimacy
might
sink
without
remark.
It
would
be
almost
beginning
their
life
of
civility
again.
Of
the
lady,
individually,
Emma
thought
very
little.
She
was
good
enough
for
Mr.
Elton,
no
doubt;
accomplished
enough
for
Highbury
handsome
enough
to
look
plain,
probably,
by
Harriet's
side.
