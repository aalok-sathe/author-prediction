me
read
it
to
him."
Harriet
looked
grave.
"My
dear
Harriet,
you
must
not
refine
too
much
upon
this
charade.
You
will
betray
your
feelings
improperly,
if
you
are
too
conscious
and
too
quick,
and
appear
to
affix
more
meaning,
or
even
quite
all
the
meaning
which
may
be
affixed
to
it.
Do
not
be
overpowered
by
such
a
little
tribute
of
admiration.
If
he
had
been
anxious
for
secrecy,
he
would
not
have
left
the
paper
while
I
was
by;
but
he
rather
pushed
it
towards
me
than
towards
you.
Do
not
let
us
be
too
solemn
on
the
business.
He
has
encouragement
enough
to
proceed,
without
our
sighing
out
our
souls
over
this
charade."
"Oh!
no
I
hope
I
shall
not
be
ridiculous
about
it.
Do
as
you
please."
Mr.
Woodhouse
came
in,
and
very
soon
led
to
the
subject
again,
by
the
recurrence
of
his
very
frequent
inquiry
of
"Well,
my
dears,
how
does
your
book
go
on?
Have
you
got
any
thing
fresh?"
"Yes,
papa;
we
have
something
to
read
you,
something
quite
fresh.
A
piece
of
paper
was
found
on
the
table
this
morning
(dropt,
we
suppose,
by
a
fairy)
containing
a
very
pretty
charade,
