had
begun
by
refusing
to
hear
him.
The
change
had
perhaps
been
somewhat
sudden;
her
proposal
of
taking
another
turn,
her
renewing
the
conversation
which
she
had
just
put
an
end
to,
might
be
a
little
extraordinary!
She
felt
its
inconsistency;
but
Mr.
Knightley
was
so
obliging
as
to
put
up
with
it,
and
seek
no
farther
explanation.
Seldom,
very
seldom,
does
complete
truth
belong
to
any
human
disclosure;
seldom
can
it
happen
that
something
is
not

of
his
own
influence.
He
had
followed
her
into
the
shrubbery
with
no
idea
of
trying
it.
He
had
come,
in
his
anxiety
to
see
how
she
bore
Frank
Churchill's
engagement,
with
no
selfish
view,
no
view
at
all,
but
of
endeavouring,
if
she
allowed
him
an
opening,
to
soothe
or
to
counsel
her.
The
rest
had
been
the
work
of
the
moment,
