think,"
he
replied,
"that
Harriet
Smith
will
soon
have
an
offer
of
marriage,
and
from
a
most
unexceptionable
quarter:
Robert
Martin
is
the
man.
Her
visit
to
Abbey
Mill,
this
summer,
seems
to
have
done
his
business.
He
is
desperately
in
love
and
means
to
marry
her."
"He
is
very
obliging,"
said
Emma;
"but
is
he
sure
that
Harriet
means
to
marry
him?"
"Well,
well,
means
to
make
her
an
offer
then.
Will
that
do?
He
came
to
the
Abbey
two
evenings
ago,
on
purpose
to
consult
me
about
it.
He
knows
I
have
a
thorough
regard
for
him
and
all
his
family,
and,
I
believe,
considers
me
as
one
of
his
best
friends.
He
came
to
ask
me
whether
I
thought
it
would
be
imprudent
in
him
to
settle
so
early;
whether
I
thought
her
too
young:
in
short,
whether
I
approved
his
choice
altogether;
having
some
apprehension
perhaps
of
her
being
considered
(especially
since
your
making
so
much
of
her)
as
in
a
line
of
society
above
him.
I
was
very
much
pleased
with
all
that
he
said.
I
never
hear
better
sense
from
any
one
than
Robert
Martin.
He
always
speaks
to
the
purpose;
open,
straightforward,
and
