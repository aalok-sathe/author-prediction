of
her
beloved
home
with
the
Campbells.
The
Mr.
Churchills
were
also
in
town;
and
they
were
only
waiting
for
November.
The
intermediate
month
was
the
one
fixed
on,
as
far
as
they
dared,
by
Emma
and
Mr.
Knightley.
They
had
determined
that
their
marriage
ought
to
be
concluded
while
John
and
Isabella
were
still
at
Hartfield,
to
allow
them
the
fortnight's
absence
in
a
tour
to
the
seaside,
which
was
the
plan.
John
and
Isabella,
and
every
other
friend,
were
agreed
in
approving
it.
But
Mr.
Woodhouse
how
was
Mr.
Woodhouse
to
be
induced
to
consent?
he,
who
had
never
yet
alluded
to
their
marriage
but
as
a
distant
event.
When
first
sounded
on
the
subject,
he
was
so
miserable,
that
they
were
almost
hopeless.
A
second
allusion,
indeed,
gave
less
pain.
He
began
to
think
it
was
to
be,
and
that
he
could
not
prevent
it
a
very
promising
step
of
the
mind
on
its
way
to
resignation.
Still,
however,
he
was
not
happy.
Nay,
he
appeared
so
much
otherwise,
that
his
daughter's
courage
failed.
She
could
not
bear
to
see
him
suffering,
to
know
him
fancying
himself
neglected;
and
though
her
understanding
almost
acquiesced
in
the
assurance
