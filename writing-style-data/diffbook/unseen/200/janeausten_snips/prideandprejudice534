to
tell
him
that
his
kindness
was
neither
unknown
nor
unfelt
by
the
whole
of
the
family.
She
was
in
hopes
that
the
evening
would
afford
some
opportunity
of
bringing
them
together;
that
the
whole
of
the
visit
would
not
pass
away
without
enabling
them
to
enter
into
something

mere
ceremonious
salutation
attending
his
entrance.
Anxious
and
uneasy,

passed
in
the
drawing

alas!
the

had
crowded

Miss
Bennet
was
making
tea,
and
Elizabeth
pouring
out
the
coffee,

there
was
not
a
single
vacancy
near
her
which
would
admit
of
a
