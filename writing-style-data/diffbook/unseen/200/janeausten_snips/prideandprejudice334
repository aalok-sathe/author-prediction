gave
them
directions
as
to
the
best
method
of
packing,
and
was
so
urgent
on
the
necessity
of
placing
gowns
in
the
only
right
way,
that
Maria
thought
herself
obliged,
on
her
return,
to
undo
all
the
work
of
the
morning,

I
am
very
certain
you
will
not
leave
the
house
without
receiving
her
thanks
for
it.
The
favour
of
your
company
has
been

you.
We

is
