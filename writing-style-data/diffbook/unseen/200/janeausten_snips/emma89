I
know
nothing
of
Mr.
Elton.
No,
my
dear
little
modest
Harriet,
depend
upon
it
the
picture
will
not
be
in
Bond
street
till
just
before
he
mounts
his
horse
to
morrow.
It
is
his
companion
all
this
evening,
his
solace,
his
delight.
It
opens
his
designs
to
his
family,
it
introduces
you
among
them,
it
diffuses
through
the
party
those
pleasantest
feelings
of
our
nature,
eager
curiosity
and
warm
prepossession.
How
cheerful,
how
animated,
how
suspicious,
how
busy
their
imaginations
all
are!"
Harriet
smiled

smiles
grew
stronger.
Harriet
slept
at
Hartfield
that

past
she
had
been
spending
more
than

safest
and
kindest,
to
keep
her
with
them
as
much
as
possible
just
at
present.
She
was
obliged
to
go
the
next
morning
for
an
hour
or
two
to
Mrs.
Goddard's,
but
it
was
then
to
be
settled
that
she
should
return
to
Hartfield,
to
make
a
regular
visit
of
some
days.
While
she
was
gone,
Mr.
Knightley
called,
and
sat
some
time
with
Mr.
Woodhouse
and
Emma,
till
