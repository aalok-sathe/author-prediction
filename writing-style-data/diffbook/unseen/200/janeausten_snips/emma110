Mr.
Perry
had
remonstrated
with
him
about
it,
and
told
him
how
shabby
it
was
in
him,
their
best
player,
to
absent
himself,
and
tried
very
much
to
persuade
him
to
put
off
his
journey
only
one
day;
but
it
would
not
do;
Mr.
Elton
had
been
determined
to
go

had
said
in
a

way
indeed,

and
had
talked
a
great

Mr.
Elton;
and
said,
looking
so
very
significantly
at
her,
"that
she
did
not
pretend
to
understand
what
his
business
might
be,
but
she
only

any
woman
whom
Mr.
Elton
could

Elton
