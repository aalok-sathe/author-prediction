living
in
it
either
too
much
or
too
little.
I
perfectly
understand
your
situation,
however,
Miss
Woodhouse
(looking
towards
Mr.
Woodhouse),
Your
father's
state
of
health
must
be
a
great
drawback.
Why
does
not
he
try
Bath?
Indeed
he
should.
Let
me
recommend
Bath
to
you.
I
assure
you
I
have
no
doubt
of

And
it
is
so
cheerful
a
place,
that
it
could
not
fail
of
being
of
use
to
Mr.
Woodhouse's
spirits,
which,
I
understand,
are
sometimes
much
depressed.
And
as
to
its
recommendations
to
you,
I
fancy
I
need
not
take
much
pains
to
dwell
on
them.
The
advantages
of
Bath
to
the

generally

for
you,
