choice.
If
Jane
repressed
her
for
a
little
time,
she
soon
began
again;
and
though
much
that
passed
between
them
was
in
a
half
whisper,
especially
on
Mrs.
Elton's
side,
there
was
no
avoiding
a
knowledge
of
their
principal
subjects:
The
post
office
catching
cold
fetching
letters
and
friendship,
were
long
under
discussion;
and
to
them
succeeded
one,
which
must
be
at
least
equally
unpleasant
to
Jane
inquiries
whether
she
had
yet
heard
of
any
situation
likely
to
suit
her,
and
professions
of
Mrs.
Elton's
meditated
activity.
"Here
is
April
come!"
said
she,
"I
get
quite
anxious
about
you.
June
will
soon
be
here."
"But
I
have
never
fixed
on
June
or
any
other
month
merely
looked
forward
to
the
summer
in
general."
"But
have
you
really
heard
of
nothing?"
"I
have
not
even
made
any
inquiry;
I
do
not
wish
to
make
any
yet."
"Oh!
my
dear,
we
cannot
begin
too
early;
you
are
not
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
procuring
exactly
the
desirable
thing."
"I
not
aware!"
said
Jane,
shaking
her
head;
"dear
Mrs.
Elton,
who
can
have
thought
of
it
as
I
have
done?"
"But
you
have
not
seen
so
much
of
the
world
as
I
have.
