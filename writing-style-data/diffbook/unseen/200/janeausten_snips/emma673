it
was
not
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
that
I
meant.
No!
(with
some
elevation)
I
was
thinking
of
a
much
more
precious
circumstance
of
Mr.
Knightley's
coming
and
asking
me
to
dance,
when
Mr.
Elton
would
not
stand
up
with
me;
and
when
there
was
no
other
partner
in
the
room.
That

the
kind
action;
that
was
the
noble
benevolence
and
generosity;
that
was
the
service
which
made
me
begin
to

"Good

and

is

She

a

moments.
Emma
could

"I
do
not

Miss
Woodhouse,"
she
resumed,
"that
you
should
feel
a
great
difference
between
the
two,
as

me
or
as
to
any
body.
You
