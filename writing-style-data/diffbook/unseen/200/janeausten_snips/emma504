must
begin
to
exert
ourselves!
Oh!
Mr.
Weston,
I
could
not
have
believed
it
of
you!"
"Aye,
we
men
are
sad
fellows.
You
must
take
care
of
yourself,
Mrs.
Elton.
This
letter
tells
us
it
is
a
short
letter
written
in
a
hurry,
merely
to
give
us
notice
it
tells
us
that
they
are
all
coming
up
to
town
directly,
on
Mrs.
Churchill's
account
she
has
not
been
well
the

winter,
and
thinks
Enscombe
too
cold
for
her
so
they
are
all

without
loss
of

"Indeed!

Yorkshire,
I

Enscombe
is
in
Yorkshire?"
"Yes,
they
are
about

from
London,
a
considerable
journey."
"Yes,
upon

Sixty

miles
farther
than
from
Maple
Grove
to
London.
But
what
is
distance,
Mr.
Weston,
to
people
of
large
fortune?
You
would
be
amazed
to
hear
how
my
brother,
Mr.
Suckling,
sometimes
flies
about.
You
will
hardly
believe
me
but
twice
in
one
week
he
and
Mr.
Bragge
went
to
London
and
back
again
with
four
horses."
"The
evil
of
the
distance
from
Enscombe,"
said
Mr.
Weston,
"is,
that
Mrs.
Churchill,
as
we
understand,
has
not
been
able
to
leave
