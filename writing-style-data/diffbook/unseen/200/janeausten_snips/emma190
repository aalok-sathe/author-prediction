and
pity,)
I
had
no
idea
that
the
law
had
been
so
great
a
slavery.
Well,
sir,
the
time
must
come
when
you
will
be
paid
for
all
this,
when
you
will
have
little
labour
and
great
enjoyment."
"My
first
enjoyment,"
replied
John
Knightley,
as
they
passed
through
the
sweep
gate,
"will
be
to
find
myself
safe
at
Hartfield
again."
Some
change
of
countenance
was
necessary
for
each
gentleman
as
they
walked
into
Mrs.
Weston's
drawing
room;
Mr.
Elton
must
compose
his
joyous
looks,
and
Mr.
John
Knightley
disperse
his
ill
humour.
Mr.
Elton
must
smile
less,
and
Mr.
John
Knightley
more,
to
fit
them
for
the
place.
Emma
only
might
be
as
nature
prompted,
and
shew
herself
just
as
happy
as
she
was.
To
her
it
was
real
enjoyment
to
be
with
the
Westons.
Mr.
Weston
was
a
great
favourite,
and
there
was
not
a
creature
in
the
world
to
whom
she
spoke
with
such
unreserve,
as
to
his
wife;
not
any
one,
to
whom
she
related
with
such
conviction
of
being
listened
to
and
understood,
of
being
always
interesting
and
always
intelligible,
the
little
affairs,
arrangements,
perplexities,
and
pleasures
of
her
father
and
herself.
She
could
tell
nothing
