the
spring
would
not
pass
without
bringing
a
crisis,
an
event,
a
something
to
alter
her
present
composed
and
tranquil
state.
It
was
not
very
long,
though
rather
longer
than
Mr.
Weston
had
foreseen,
before
she
had
the
power
of
forming
some
opinion
of
Frank
Churchill's
feelings.
The
Enscombe
family
were
not
in
town
quite
so
soon
as
had
been
imagined,

same
tenderness
in
the
same
degree.
She
watched
him
well.
It
was
a
clear
thing

was
less
in
love
than
he
had
been.
Absence,
with
the
conviction
probably
of
her
indifference,
