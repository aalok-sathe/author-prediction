Poor
old
Mrs.
Bates,
civil
and
humble
as
usual,
looked
as
if
she
did
not
quite
understand
what
was
going
on.
"I
am
afraid
Jane
is
not
very
well,"
said
she,
"but
I
do
not
know;
they
tell
me

look
and
manner.
A
very
friendly
inquiry
after
Miss
Fairfax,
she
hoped,
might
lead
the
way
to
a
return
of
old
feelings.
The
touch
seemed
immediate.
"Ah!
Miss
Woodhouse,
how
kind
you
are!
I
suppose
you
have
heard
and
are
