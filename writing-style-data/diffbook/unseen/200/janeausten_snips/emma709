and
manners

are
important;
equality
in
every
point
but

and
that

since
the
purity
of
her
heart
is
not
to
be
doubted,
such
as
must
increase
his
felicity,
for
it
will
be
his

bestow
the
only
advantages
she

A
man
would
always
wish
to
give
a
woman

His
friends
are
eager
to
promote
his
happiness.
He
had
used
every
body
ill
and
they
are
all
delighted
to
forgive
him.
He
is
a
fortunate
man
indeed!"
"You
speak
as
if
you
envied
him."
"And
I
do
envy
him,
Emma.
