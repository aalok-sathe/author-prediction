misunderstood
me!
I
know
we
agreed
never
to
name
him
but
considering
how
infinitely
superior
he
is
to
every
body
else,
I
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
that
I
could
be
supposed
to
mean
any
other
person.

Frank
Churchill,
indeed!
I
do
not
know
who
would

if
you
had
not
told
me
that
more
wonderful
things
had
happened;
that
there
had
been
matches
of
greater
disparity
(those
were
your
very
words);
I
should
not
have
dared
to
give
way
to
I
should
not
have
thought
it

of
farther
mistake.
