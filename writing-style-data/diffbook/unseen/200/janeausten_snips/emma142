say
to
Harriet,
as
they
walked
away,
"These
are
the
sights,
Harriet,
to
do
one
good.
How
trifling
they
make
every
thing
else
appear!
I
feel
now
as
if
I
could
think
of
nothing
but
these
poor
creatures
all
the
rest

"Oh!

said
her
companion.
They
walked
on.
The
lane
made
a
slight

and
when
that
bend
was
passed,
Mr.
Elton
was
immediately
in
sight;
and
so
near
as
to
give
Emma
time
only
to
say

very
sudden
trial
of
