a
very
proud,
ill
natured
boy.
Mrs.
Gardiner's
caution
to
Elizabeth
was
punctually
and
kindly
given
on
the
first
favourable
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
alone;
after
honestly
telling
her
what
she
thought,
she
thus
went
on:
"You
are
too
sensible
a
girl,
Lizzy,
to
fall
in
love
merely
because
you
are
warned
against
it;
and,
therefore,
I
am
not

you
to
use
it.
Your
father
would
depend
on
your
resolution
and
good
conduct,
I
am
sure.
You
must
not
disappoint
your
father."
"My
dear
aunt,
this
is
being
serious
indeed."
"Yes,
and
I
hope
to
engage
you
to
be
serious
likewise."
"Well,
then,
you
need
not
be
under
any
alarm.
