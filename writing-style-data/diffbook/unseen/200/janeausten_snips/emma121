it
is
strange;
it
is
out
of
the
common
course
that
what
is
so
evidently,
so
palpably
desirable
what
courts
the
pre
arrangement
of
other
people,
should
so
immediately
shape
itself
into
the
proper
form.
You
and
Mr.
Elton
are
by
situation
called
together;
you
belong
to
one
another
by
every
circumstance
of
your
respective
homes.
Your
marrying
will
be
equal
to
the
match
at
Randalls.
There
does
seem
to
be
a
something
in
the
air
of
Hartfield
which
gives
love
exactly
the
right
direction,
and
sends
it
into
the
very
channel
where
it
ought
to
flow.
The
course
of
true
love
never
did
run
smooth
A
Hartfield
edition
of
Shakespeare
would
have
a
long
note
on
that
passage."
"That
Mr.
Elton
should
really
be
in
love
with
me,
me,
of
all
people,
who
did
not
know
him,
to
speak
to
him,
at
Michaelmas!
And
he,
the
very
handsomest
man
that
ever
was,
and
a
man
that
every
body
looks
up
to,
quite
like
Mr.
Knightley!
His
company
so
sought
after,
that
every
body
says
he
need
not
eat
a
single
meal
by
himself
if
he
does
not
chuse
it;
that
he
has
more
invitations
than
there
are
days
in
