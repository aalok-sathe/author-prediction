all
going
to
sit
down
to
cards,
she
could
not
be
wanted
to
counteract
her
mother's
schemes.
But
on
returning
to
the
drawing
room,
when
her
letter
was
finished,
she
saw,
to
her
infinite
surprise,
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
her
mother
had
been
too
ingenious
for
her.
On
opening
the
door,
she
perceived
her
sister
and
Bingley
standing
together
over
the
hearth,
as
if
engaged
in
earnest
conversation;
and
had
this
led
to
no
suspicion,
the
faces
of
both,
as
they
hastily
turned
round
and
moved
away
from
each
other,
would
have
told
it
all.
Their
situation
was
awkward
enough;
but
hers
she
thought
was
still
worse.
Not
a
syllable
was
uttered
by
either;
and
Elizabeth
was
on
the
point
of
going
away
again,
when
Bingley,
who
as
well
as
the
other
had
sat
down,
suddenly
rose,
and
whispering
a
few
words
to
her
sister,
ran
out
of
the
room.
Jane
could
have
no
reserves
from
Elizabeth,
where
confidence
would
give
pleasure;
and
instantly
embracing
her,
acknowledged,
with
the
liveliest
emotion,
that
she
was
the
happiest
creature
in
the
world.
"'Tis
too
much!"
she
added,
"by
far
too
much.
I
do
not
deserve
it.
Oh!
why
is
not
