too?
Who
had
been
at
pains
to
give
Harriet
notions
of
self
consequence
but
herself?
Who
but
herself
had
taught
her,
that
she
was
to
elevate
herself
if
possible,
and
that
her
claims
were
great
to
a
high
worldly
establishment?
If
Harriet,
from
being
humble,
were
grown

Till

that
she
was
threatened
with
its
loss,
Emma
had
never
known

had
been
only
Isabella
whose
claims
could
be
compared
with
hers,
and
she
had
always
known
exactly
how
far
he
loved
and
esteemed
Isabella.
She
had
herself
been
first
with
him
for
many
years
past.
She
had
not
deserved

she
had
often
been
negligent
or
perverse,
slighting

advice,
or
even
wilfully
opposing
