rather
attentive
than
otherwise
to
them;
but
then,
Mr.
Knightley
did
not
make
due
allowance
for
the
influence
of
a
strong
passion
at
war
with
all
interested
motives.
Mr.
Knightley
saw
no
such
passion,
and
of
course
thought
nothing
of
its
effects;
but
she
saw
too
much
of
it
to
feel
a
doubt
of
its
overcoming
any
hesitations
that
a
reasonable
prudence
might
originally
suggest;
and
more
than
a
reasonable,
becoming
degree
of
prudence,
she
was
very
sure
did
not
belong
to
Mr.
Elton.
Harriet's
cheerful
look
and
manner
established
hers:
she
came
back,
not
to
think
of
Mr.
Martin,
but
to
talk
of
Mr.
Elton.
Miss
Nash
had
been
telling
her
something,
which
she
repeated
immediately
with
great
delight.
Mr.
Perry
had
been
to
Mrs.
Goddard's
to
attend
a
sick
child,
and
Miss
Nash
had
seen
him,
and
he
had
told
Miss
Nash,
that
as
he
was
coming
back
yesterday
from
Clayton
Park,
he
had
met
Mr.
Elton,
and
found
to
his
great
surprize,
that
Mr.
Elton
was
actually
on
his
road
to
London,
and
not
meaning
to
return
till
the
morrow,
though
it
was
the
whist
club
night,
which
he
had
been
never
known
to
miss
before;
and
