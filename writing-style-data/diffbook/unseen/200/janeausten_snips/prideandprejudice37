action
of
doing
a
very
gallant
thing,
and
called
out
to
her:
"My
dear
Miss
Eliza,
why
are
you
not
dancing?
Mr.
Darcy,
you
must
allow
me
to
present
this
young
lady
to
you
as
a
very
desirable
partner.
You
cannot
refuse
to
dance,
I
am
sure
when
so
much
beauty
is
before
you."
And,
taking
her
hand,
he
would

that
I

to

Elizabeth

nor

Sir
William
at
all
shake
her
purpose
by
his
attempt
at
persuasion.
"You
excel
so
much
in
the
dance,
Miss
Eliza,
that
it
is
cruel
to
deny
me
the
happiness
of
seeing
you;
and
though
this
gentleman
dislikes
the
amusement
in
general,
he
can
have
no
objection,
I
am
sure,
to
oblige

Darcy
