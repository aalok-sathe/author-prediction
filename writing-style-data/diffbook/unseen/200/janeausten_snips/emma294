meeting.
It
had
been
serviceable
in
deadening
the
first
shock,
without
retaining
any
influence
to
alarm.
As
Harriet
now
lived,
the
Martins
could
not
get
at
her,
without
seeking
her,
where
hitherto
they
had
wanted
either
the
courage
or
the
condescension
to
seek
her;
for
since
her
refusal
of
the
brother,
the
sisters
never
had
been
at
Mrs.
Goddard's;
and
a
twelvemonth
might
pass
without
their
being
thrown
together
again,
with
any
necessity,
or
even
any
power
of
speech.
Human
nature
is
so
well
disposed
towards
those
who
are
in
interesting
situations,
that
a
young
person,
who
either
marries
or
dies,
is
sure
of
being
kindly
spoken
of.
A
week
had
not
passed
since
Miss
Hawkins's
name
was
first
mentioned
in
Highbury,
before
she
was,
by
some
means
or
other,
discovered
to
have
every
recommendation
of
person
and
mind;
to
be
handsome,
elegant,
highly
accomplished,
and
perfectly
amiable:
and
when
Mr.
Elton
himself
arrived
to
triumph
in
his
happy
prospects,
and
circulate
the
fame
of
her
merits,
there
was
very
little
more
for
him
to
do,
than
to
tell
her
Christian
name,
and
say
whose
music
she
principally
played.
Mr.
Elton
returned,
a
very
happy
man.
He
had
gone
away
