intently;
he
had
at
first
hoped
to
induce
Mr.
Woodhouse
to
remove
with
her
to
Donwell;
he
had
wanted
to
believe
it
feasible,
but
his
knowledge
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
not
suffer
him
to
deceive
himself
long;
and
now
he
confessed
his
persuasion,
that
such
a
transplantation
would
be
a
risk
of
her
father's
comfort,
perhaps
even
of
his
life,
which
must
not
be
hazarded.
Mr.
Woodhouse
taken
from
Hartfield!
No,
he
felt
that
it
ought
not
to
be
attempted.
But
the
plan
which
had
arisen
on
the
sacrifice
of
this,
he
trusted
his
dearest
Emma
would
not
find
in
any
respect

was,
that
he
should
be
received
at
Hartfield;
that
so
long
as
her
father's
happiness
in
other
words,
his
life
required
Hartfield
to
continue
her
home,
it
should
be
his
likewise.
Of
their
all
removing
to
Donwell,
Emma
had
already
had
her
own
passing
thoughts.
Like
him,
she
had
tried
the
scheme
and
rejected
it;
but
such
an
alternative
as
this
had
not
occurred
to
her.
She
was
sensible
of
all
the
affection
it
evinced.
She
felt
that,
in
quitting
Donwell,
he
must
be
sacrificing
a
great
deal
of
independence
of
hours
and
habits;
that
