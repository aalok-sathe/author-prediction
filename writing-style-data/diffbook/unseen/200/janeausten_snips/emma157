he
is
three
and
twenty.
You
forget
how
time
passes."
"Three
and
twenty!
is
he
indeed?
Well,
I
could
not
have
thought
it
and
he
was
but
two
years
old
when
he
lost
his
poor
mother!
Well,
time
does
fly
indeed!
and
my
memory
is
very
bad.
However,
it
was
an
exceeding
good,
pretty
letter,
and
gave
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
a
great
deal
of
pleasure.
I
remember
it
was
written
from
Weymouth,
and
dated
Sept.
28th
and
began,
'My
dear
Madam,'
but
I
forget
how
it
went
on;
and
it
was
signed
'F.
C.
Weston

I
remember
that
perfectly."
"How
very
pleasing
and
proper
of
him!"
cried
the
good
hearted
Mrs.
John
Knightley.
"I
have
no
doubt
of
his
being
a
most
amiable
young
man.
But
how
sad
it
is
that
he
should
not
live
at
home
with
his
father!
There
is
something
so
shocking
in
a
child's
being
taken
away
from
his
parents
and
natural
home!
I
never
could
comprehend
how
Mr.
Weston
could
part
with
him.
To
give
up
one's
child!
I
really
never
could
think
well
of
any
body
who
proposed
such
a
thing
to
any
body
else."
"Nobody
ever
did
think
well
of
the
