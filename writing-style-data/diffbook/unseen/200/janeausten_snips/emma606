a
pleasant
party.
Mr.
Weston
directed
the
whole,
officiating
safely
between
Hartfield
and
the
Vicarage,
and
every
body
was
in
good
time.
Emma
and
Harriet
went
together;
Miss
Bates
and
her
niece,
with
the
Eltons;
the
gentlemen
on
horseback.
Mrs.
Weston
remained
with
Mr.
Woodhouse.
Nothing
was
wanting
but
to
be
happy
when
they
got
there.
Seven
miles
were
travelled
in
expectation
of
enjoyment,
and
every
body
had
a
burst
of
admiration
on
first
arriving;
but
in
the
general
amount
of
the
day
there
was
deficiency.
There
was
a
languor,
a
want
of
spirits,
a
want
of
union,
which
could
not
be
got
over.
They
separated
too
much
into
parties.
The
Eltons
walked
together;
Mr.
Knightley
took
charge
of
Miss
Bates
and
Jane;
and
Emma
and
Harriet
belonged
to
Frank
Churchill.
And
Mr.
Weston
tried,
in
vain,
to
make
them
harmonise
better.
It
seemed
at
first
an
accidental
division,
but
it
never
materially
varied.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Elton,
indeed,
shewed
no
unwillingness
to
mix,
and
be
as
agreeable
as
they
could;
but
during
the
two
whole
hours
that
were
spent
on
the
hill,
there
seemed
a
principle
of
separation,
between
the
other
parties,
too
strong
for
any
fine
prospects,
or
