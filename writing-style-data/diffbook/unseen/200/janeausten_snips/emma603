interest
in
their
employment;
and
regret,
in
a
reasonable
way,
that
he
should
be
so
late.
He
was
not
in
his
best
spirits,
but
seemed
trying
to
improve
them;
and,
at
last,
made
himself
talk
nonsense
very
agreeably.
They
were
looking
over
views
in
Swisserland.
"As
soon
as
my
aunt
gets
well,
I
shall
go
abroad,"
said
he.
"I
shall
never
be
easy
till
I
have
seen
some

these
places.
You
will
have

for
her.
I
have
more
than
half
an
expectation
of
our
all
going
abroad.
I
assure
you
I
have.
I
feel
a
strong
persuasion,
this
morning,
that
I
shall
soon
be
abroad.
I
ought
to
travel.
I
am
tired
of
doing
nothing.
I
want
a
change.
I
am
serious,
Miss
Woodhouse,
whatever
your
penetrating
eyes
may
fancy
I
am
sick
of
England
