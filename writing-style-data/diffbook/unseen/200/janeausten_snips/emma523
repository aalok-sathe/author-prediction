name
as
early
a
day
as
possible.
Mr.
Weston's
ball
was
to
be
a
real
thing.
A
very
few
to
morrows
stood
between
the
young
people
of
Highbury
and
happiness.
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
resigned.
The
time
of
year
lightened
the
evil
to
him.
May
was
better
for
every
thing
than
February.
Mrs.
Bates
was
engaged
to
spend
the
evening
at
Hartfield,
James
had
due
notice,
and
he
sanguinely
hoped
that
neither
dear
little
Henry
nor
dear
little
John
would
have
any
thing
the
matter
with
them,
while
dear
Emma
were
gone.
No
misfortune
occurred,
again
to
prevent
the
ball.
The
day
approached,
the
day
arrived;
and
after
a
morning
of
some
anxious
watching,
Frank
Churchill,
in
all
the
certainty
of
his
own
self,
reached
Randalls
before
dinner,
and
every
thing
was
safe.
No
second
meeting
had
there
yet
been
between
him
and
Emma.
The
room
at
the
Crown
was
to
witness
it;
but
it
would
be
better
than
a
common
meeting
in
a
crowd.
Mr.
Weston
had
been
so
very
earnest
in
his
entreaties
for
her
arriving
there
as
soon
as
possible
after
themselves,
for
the
purpose
of
taking
her
opinion
as
to
the
propriety
and
comfort
of
the
rooms
