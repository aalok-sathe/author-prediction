it
most
prudent
to
go
with
her.
Another
accidental
meeting
with
the
Martins
was
possible,
and
in
her
present
state,
would
be
dangerous.
Harriet,
tempted
by
every
thing
and
swayed
by
half
a
word,
was
always
very
long
at
a
purchase;
and
while
she
was
still
hanging
over
muslins
and
changing
her
mind,
Emma
went
to
the
door
for
amusement.
Much
could
not
be
hoped
from
the
traffic
of
even
the
busiest
part
of
Highbury;
Mr.
Perry
walking
hastily
by,
Mr.
William
Cox
letting
himself
in
at
the
office
door,
Mr.
Cole's
carriage
horses
returning
from
exercise,
or
a
stray
letter
boy
on
an
obstinate
mule,
were
the
liveliest
objects
she
could
presume
to
expect;
and
when
her
eyes
fell
only
on
the
butcher
with
his
tray,
a
tidy
old
woman
travelling
homewards
from
shop
with
her
full
basket,
two
curs
quarrelling
over
a
dirty
bone,
and
a
string
of
dawdling
children
round
the
baker's
little
bow
window
eyeing
the
gingerbread,
she
knew
she
had
no
reason
to
complain,
and
was
amused
enough;
quite
enough
still
to
stand
at
the
door.
A
mind
lively
and
at
ease,
can
do
with
seeing
nothing,
and
can
see
nothing
that
does
not
answer.
