if
his
father
had
not
made
his
appearance?
Mr.
Woodhouse
soon
followed;
and
the
necessity
of
exertion
made
him
composed.
A
very
few
minutes
more,
however,
completed
the
present
trial.
Mr.
Weston,
always
alert
when
business
was
to
be
done,
and
as
incapable
of
procrastinating
any
evil
that

of
foreseeing
any

In
her
letters
I
shall
be
at
dear
Highbury
again."
A
very
friendly
shake
of
the
hand,
a
very
earnest
"Good
bye,"
closed
the
speech,
and
the
door
had
soon
shut
out
Frank
Churchill.
Short

been
the
