You
do
not
know
how
many
candidates
there
always
are
for
the
first
situations.
I
saw
a
vast
deal
of
that
in
the
neighbourhood
round
Maple
Grove.
A
cousin
of
Mr.
Suckling,
Mrs.
Bragge,
had
such
an
infinity
of
applications;
every
body
was
anxious
to
be
in
her
family,
for
she
moves
in
the
first
circle.
Wax
candles
in
the
schoolroom!
You
may
imagine
how
desirable!
Of
all
houses
in
the
kingdom
Mrs.
Bragge's
is
the
one
I
would
most
wish
to
see
you
in."
"Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
are
to
be
in
town
again
by
midsummer,"
said
Jane.
"I
must
spend
some
time
with
them;
I
am
sure
they
will
want
it;
afterwards
I
may
probably
be
glad
to
dispose
of
myself.
But
I
would
not
wish
you
to
take
the
trouble
of
making
any
inquiries
at
present."
"Trouble!
aye,
I
know
your
scruples.
You
are
afraid
of
giving
me
trouble;
but
I
assure
you,
my
dear
Jane,
the
Campbells
can
hardly
be
more
interested
about
you
than
I
am.
I
shall
write
to
Mrs.
Partridge
in
a
day
or
two,
and
shall
give
her
a
strict
charge
to
be
on
the
look
out
for
any
thing
eligible."
"Thank
