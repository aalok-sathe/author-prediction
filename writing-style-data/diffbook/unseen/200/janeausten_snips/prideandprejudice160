engaged
Mr.
Collins's
conversation
to
herself.
She
was
at
least
free
from
the
offense
of
Mr.
Darcy's
further
notice;
though
often
standing
within
a
very
short
distance
of
her,
quite
disengaged,
he
never
came
near
enough
to
speak.
She
felt
it
to
be
the
probable
consequence
of
her
allusions
to
Mr.
Wickham,
and
rejoiced
in
it.
The
Longbourn
party
were
the
last
of
all
the
company
to
depart,
and,
by
a
manoeuvre
of
Mrs.
Bennet,
had
to
wait
for
their
carriage
a

and
were
evidently
impatient
to
have
the
house
to
themselves.
They
repulsed
every
attempt
of
Mrs.
Bennet
at
conversation,
and
by
so
doing
threw
a
languor
over
the
whole
party,
which
was
very
little
relieved
by
the
long
speeches
of
Mr.
Collins,
who
was
complimenting
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
sisters
on
the
elegance
of
their
entertainment,
and
the
hospitality
and
politeness
which
had
marked
their
behaviour
to
their
guests.
Darcy
said
nothing
at
all.
Mr.
Bennet,
