disappointed;
and
at
last
I
was
not
disappointed
either
in
the
object
of
my
journey.
A
great
deal
of
very
reasonable,
very
just
displeasure
I
had
to
persuade
away.
But
it
is
done;
we
are
reconciled,
dearer,
much
dearer,
than
ever,
and
no
moment's
uneasiness
can
ever
occur
between
us
again.
Now,
my
dear
madam,
I
will
release
you;
but
I
could
not
conclude
before.
A
thousand
and
a
thousand
thanks
for
all
the
kindness
you
have
ever
shewn
me,
and
ten
thousand
for
the
attentions
your
heart
will
dictate
towards
her.
If
you
think
me
in
a
way
to
be
happier
than
I
deserve,
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion.
Miss
W.
calls
me
the
child
of
good
fortune.
I
hope
she
is
right.
In
one
respect,
my
good
fortune
is
undoubted,
that
of
being
able
to
subscribe
myself,
Your
obliged
and
affectionate
Son,
F.
C.
WESTON
CHURCHILL.
This
letter
must
make
its
way
to
Emma's
feelings.
She
was
obliged,
in
spite
of
her
previous
determination
to
the
contrary,
to
do
it
all
the
justice
that
Mrs.
Weston
foretold.
As
soon
as
she
came
to
her
own
name,
it
was
irresistible;
every
line
relating
to
herself
was
interesting,
and
