Emma
said
it
would
be
awkward;
Mrs.
Weston
was
in
distress
about
the
supper;
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
opposed
it
earnestly,
on
the
score
of
health.
It
made
him
so
very
unhappy,
indeed,
that
it
could
not
be
persevered
in.
"Oh!
no,"
said
he;
"it
would
be
the
extreme
of
imprudence.
I
could
not
bear
it
for
Emma!
Emma
is
not
strong.
She
would
catch
a
dreadful
cold.
So
would
poor
little
Harriet.
So
you
would
all.
Mrs.
Weston,
you
would
be
quite
laid
up;
do
not
let
them
talk
of
such
a
wild
thing.
Pray
do
not
let
them
talk
of
it.
That
young
man
(speaking
lower)
is
very
thoughtless.
Do
not
tell
his
father,
but
that
young
man
is
not
quite
the
thing.
He
has
been
opening
the
doors
very
often
this
evening,
and
keeping
them
open
very
inconsiderately.
He
does
not
think
of
the
draught.
I
do
not
mean
to
set
you
against
him,
but
indeed
he
is
not
quite
the
thing!"
Mrs.
Weston
was
sorry
for
such
a
charge.
She
knew
the
importance
of
it,
and
said
every
thing
in
her
power
to
do
it
away.
Every
door
was
now
closed,
the
passage
plan
given
up,
and
