passed,
by
the
arrival
of
the
very
persons
of
whom
they
had
been
speaking;
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
sisters
came
to
give
their
personal
invitation
for
the
long
expected
ball
at
Netherfield,
which
was
fixed
for
the
following
Tuesday.
The
two
ladies
were
delighted
to
see
their
dear
friend
again,
called
it
an
age
since
they
had
met,
and
repeatedly
asked
what
she
had
been
doing
with
herself
since
their
separation.
To
the
rest
of
the
family
they
paid
little
attention;
avoiding
Mrs.
Bennet
as
much
as
possible,
saying
not

to
Elizabeth,
and

eager
to
escape
from
Mrs.
Bennet's
civilities.
The
prospect
of
the
Netherfield
ball
was
extremely
agreeable
to
every
female
of
the
family.
Mrs.
Bennet
chose
to
consider
it
as
given
in
compliment
to
her
eldest
daughter,
and
was
particularly
flattered
by
receiving
the
invitation
from
Mr.
Bingley
himself,
instead
of
a
ceremonious
card.
Jane
pictured
to
herself
a
happy
evening
in
the
society
of
her
two
friends,
and
the
attentions
of
their
brother;
and
Elizabeth
thought
