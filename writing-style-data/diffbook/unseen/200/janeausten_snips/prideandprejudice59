in
the
morning,
if
Miss
Bennet
were
not
decidedly
better.
Bingley
was
quite
uncomfortable;
his
sisters
declared
that
they
were
miserable.
They
solaced
their
wretchedness,
however,
by
duets
after
supper,
while
he
could
find
no
better
relief
to
his
feelings
than
by
giving
his
housekeeper
directions
that
every
attention
might
be
paid
to
the
sick
lady
and
her
sister.
Elizabeth
passed
the
chief
of
the
night
in
her
sister's
room,
and
in
the
morning
had
the
pleasure
of
being
able
to
send
a
tolerable
answer
to
the
inquiries
which
she
very
early
received
from
Mr.
Bingley
by
a
housemaid,
and
some
time
afterwards
from
the
two
elegant
ladies
who
waited
on
his
sisters.
In
spite
of
this
amendment,
however,
she
requested
to
have
a
note
sent
to
Longbourn,
desiring
her
mother
to
visit
Jane,
and
form
her
own
judgement
of
her
situation.
The
note
was
immediately
dispatched,
and
its
contents
as
quickly
complied
with.
Mrs.
Bennet,
accompanied
by
her
two
youngest
girls,
reached
Netherfield
soon
after
the
family
breakfast.
Had
she
found
Jane
in
any
apparent
danger,
Mrs.
Bennet
would
have
been
very
miserable;
but
being
satisfied
on
seeing
her
that
her
illness
was
not
alarming,
she
had
no
wish
