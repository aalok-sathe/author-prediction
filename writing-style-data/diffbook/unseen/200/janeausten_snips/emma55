read
more

They
will
read
together.
She
means
it,
I
know."
"Emma
has
been
meaning
to
read
more
ever
since
she
was
twelve
years
old.
I
have
seen
a
great
many
lists
of
her
drawing
up
at
various
times
of
books
that
she
meant
to
read
regularly
through
and
very
good
lists
they
were
very
well
chosen,
and

alphabetically,
and
sometimes
by
some
other
rule.
The

steady
reading
from
Emma.
She
will
never
submit
to
any
thing
requiring
industry
and
patience,
and
a
subjection
of
the
fancy
to
the
understanding.
Where
Miss
Taylor
failed
to
stimulate,
I
may
safely
affirm
that
Harriet
Smith
will
do
nothing.
You
never
could
persuade
her
to
read
half
so
much
as
you
wished.
You
know
you
could
not."
"I
dare
say,"
replied
Mrs.
Weston,
smiling,
"that
I
thought
so

but
since
we
have
parted,
I
can
never
remember
