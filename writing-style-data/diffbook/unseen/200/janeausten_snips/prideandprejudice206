place
in
it!"
"My
dear,
do
not
give
way
to
such
gloomy
thoughts.
Let
us
hope
for
better
things.
Let
us
flatter
ourselves
that
I
may
be
the
survivor."
This
was
not
very
consoling
to
Mrs.
Bennet,
and
therefore,
instead
of
making
any

cannot
bear

should
have
all

to
entail

I
cannot
understand;
and
all

Mr.
Collins
too!
Why
should
he
have
it
more
than
anybody

"I
leave
it
to

to
determine,"
said
Mr.
Bennet.
Miss
Bingley's
letter
arrived,
and
put
an
end
to
doubt.
The
very
first
sentence
conveyed
the
assurance
of
their

London
for

winter,
and
concluded
