of
Mrs.
John
Knightley
and
little
John,
and
he
followed
with
Miss
Smith
and
Henry;
and
that
at
one
time
they
were
in
such
a
crowd,
as
to
make
Miss
Smith
rather
uneasy."
He
stopped.
Emma
dared
not
attempt
any
immediate
reply.
To
speak,
she
was
sure
would
be
to
betray
a
most
unreasonable
degree
of
happiness.
She
must
wait
a
moment,
or
he
would
think
her
mad.
Her
silence
disturbed
him;
and
after
observing
her
a
little
while,
he
added,
"Emma,
my
love,
you
said
that
this
circumstance
would
not
now
make
you
unhappy;
but
I
am
afraid
it
gives
you
more
pain
than
you
expected.
His
situation
is
an
evil
but
you
must
consider
it
as
what
satisfies
your
friend;
and
I
will
answer
for
your
thinking
better
and
better
of
him
as
you
know
him
more.
His
good
sense
and
good
principles
would
delight
you.
As
far
as
the
man
is
concerned,
you
could
not
wish
your
friend
in
better
hands.
His
rank
in
society
I
would
alter
if
I
could,
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
I
assure
you,
Emma.
You
laugh
at
me
about
William
Larkins;
but
I
could
quite
as
ill
spare
Robert
Martin."
