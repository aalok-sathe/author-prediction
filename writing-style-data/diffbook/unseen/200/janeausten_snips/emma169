is
the
matter,
sir?
Did
you
speak
to
me?"
cried
Mr.
John
Knightley,
hearing
his
own
name.
"I
am
sorry
to
find,
my
love,
that
my
father
does
not
think
you
looking
well
but
I
hope
it
is
only
from
being
a
little
fatigued.
I
could
have
wished,
however,
as
you
know,
that
you
had
seen
Mr.
Wingfield
before
you
left
home."
"My
dear
Isabella,"
exclaimed
he
hastily
"pray
do
not
concern
yourself
about
my
looks.
Be
satisfied
with
doctoring
and
coddling
yourself
and
the
children,
and
let
me
look
as
I
chuse."
"I
did
not
thoroughly
understand
what
you
were
telling
your
brother,"
cried
Emma,
"about
your
friend
Mr.
Graham's
intending
to
have
a
bailiff
from
Scotland,
to
look
after
his
new
estate.
What
will
it
answer?
Will
not
the
old
prejudice
be
too
strong?"
And
she
talked
in
this
way
so
long
and
successfully
that,
when
forced
to
give
her
attention
again
to
her
father
and
sister,
she
had
nothing
worse
to
hear
than
Isabella's
kind
inquiry
after
Jane
Fairfax;
and
Jane
Fairfax,
though
no
great
favourite
with
her
in
general,
she
was
at
that
moment
very
happy
to
assist
in
praising.
"That
sweet,
amiable
Jane
Fairfax!"
said
