I
thought
he
would
have
staid
now,
and
it
would
have
been
a
pity
not
to
have
mentioned....
Well,
(returning
to
the
room,)
I
have
not
been
able
to
succeed.
Mr.
Knightley
cannot
stop.
He
is
going
to
Kingston.
He
asked
me
if
he
could
do
any
thing...."
"Yes,"
said
Jane,
"we
heard
his
kind
offers,
we
heard
every
thing."
"Oh!
yes,
my
dear,
I

might,
because
you

the
door
was
open,
and
the
window
was
open,
and
Mr.
Knightley
spoke
loud.
You
must

to
be
sure.

just
mentioned....
Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
must
you
be
going?
You
seem
but
just
come
so
very
obliging
of
you."
Emma
found
it
really
time
to
be
at
home;
the
visit
had
already
lasted
long;
and
on
examining
watches,
so
much
of
the
morning
was
perceived
to
be
gone,
that
Mrs.
Weston
and
her
companion
taking
leave
also,
could
allow
themselves
only
to
walk
with
the
two
young
ladies
to
Hartfield
gates,
before
they
set
off
for
Randalls.
It
may
be
possible
to
do
without
dancing
entirely.
Instances
