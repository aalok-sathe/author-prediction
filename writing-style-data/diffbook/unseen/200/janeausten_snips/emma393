believe
we
had
a
great
many
left.
Oh,
said
I,
my
dear,
I
did
say
as
much
as
I
could.
However,
the
very
same
evening
William
Larkins
came
over
with
a
large
basket
of
apples,
the
same
sort
of
apples,
a
bushel
at
least,
and
I
was
very
much
obliged,
and
went
down
and
spoke
to
William
Larkins
and
said
every
thing,
as
you
may
suppose.
William
Larkins
is
such
an
old
acquaintance!
I
am
always
glad
to
see
him.
But,
however,
I
found
afterwards
from
Patty,
that
William
said
it
was
all
the
apples
of
that
sort
his
master
had;
he
had
brought
them
all
and
now
his
master
had
not
one
left
to
bake
or
boil.
William
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
himself,
he
was
so
pleased
to
think
his
master
had
sold
so
many;
for
William,
you
know,
thinks
more
of
his
master's
profit
than
any
thing;
but
Mrs.
Hodges,
he
said,
was
quite
displeased
at
their
being
all
sent
away.
She
could
not
bear
that
her
master
should
not
be
able
to
have
another
apple
tart
this
spring.
He
told
Patty
this,
but
bid
her
not
mind
it,
and
be
sure
not
to
say
any
