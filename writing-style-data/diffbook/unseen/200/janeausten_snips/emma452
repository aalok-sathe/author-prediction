have
lived
so
secluded
a
life;
and
I
could
immediately
secure
you
some
of
the
best
society
in
the
place.
A
line
from
me
would
bring
you
a
little
host
of
acquaintance;
and
my
particular
friend,
Mrs.
Partridge,
the
lady
I
have
always
resided
with
when
in
Bath,
would
be
most
happy
to
shew
you
any
attentions,
and
would
be
the
very
person
for
you
to
go
into
public

It
was
as
much
as
Emma
could
bear,
without
being
impolite.
The
idea
of
her
being
indebted
to
Mrs.

who,
with
the
help
of
a

just
made
a
shift
to
live!
The
dignity
of
Miss
Woodhouse,
of
Hartfield,
was
sunk
indeed!
She
restrained
herself,
however,
from
any
of
the
reproofs
she
could
have
given,
and
only
thanked
Mrs.
Elton
coolly;
"but
their
going
to
Bath
was
quite
out
of
the
question;
and
she
was
not
perfectly
convinced
that
the
place
might
suit
her
better
than
her
father."
And
then,
to
prevent
farther
outrage
and
indignation,
changed
the
subject
directly.
