Emma
was
most
sincerely
interested.
Her
heart
had
been
long
growing
kinder
towards
Jane;
and
this
picture
of
her
present
sufferings
acted
as
a
cure
of
every
former
ungenerous
suspicion,
and
left
her
nothing
but
pity;
and
the
remembrance
of
the
less
just
and
less
gentle
sensations
of
the
past,
obliged
her
to
admit
that
Jane
might
very

be
as

Miss
Fairfax's
advantage
and
comfort
as

was
to
be

"So

kind!"
replied
Miss
Bates.
"But
you
are
always
kind."
There
was
no
bearing
such
an
"always;"
and
to
break
through
her
dreadful
gratitude,
Emma
made
the
direct
inquiry
of
"Where
may
I
ask?
is
Miss
Fairfax
going?"
"To
a
Mrs.
Smallridge
charming
woman
most
superior
to
have
the
charge
of
her
three

children.
