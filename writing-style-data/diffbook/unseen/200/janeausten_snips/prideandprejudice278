prudential
light
it
is
certainly
a
very
good
match
for
her."
"It
must
be
very
agreeable
for
her
to
be
settled
within
so
easy
a
distance
of
her
own
family
and
friends."
"An
easy
distance,
do
you
call
it?
It
is
nearly
fifty
miles."
"And
what
is
fifty
miles
of
good
road?
Little
more
than
half
a

journey.
Yes,
I

easy
distance."
"I
should
never
have

Hertfordshire.
Anything
beyond
the
very
neighbourhood
of
Longbourn,
I
suppose,
would
appear
far."

which
Elizabeth
fancied
she
understood;
he
must
be
supposing
her
to
be
thinking
of
Jane
and
Netherfield,
and
she
blushed
as
she
answered:
"I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
a
woman
may
not
be
settled
too
near
her
family.
The
far
and
the
near
must
be
relative,
and
depend
on
many
varying
circumstances.
Where
there
is
fortune
to
make
the
expenses
of
travelling
unimportant,
distance
becomes
no
evil.
But
