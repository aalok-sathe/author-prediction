an
ugly
fellow!
I
am
glad
he
is
gone.
I
never
saw
such
a
long
chin
in
my
life.
Well,
but
now
for
my
news;
it
is
about
dear
Wickham;
too
good
for
the
waiter,
is
it
not?
There
is
no
danger
of
Wickham's
marrying
Mary
King.
There's

you!
She
is

Elizabeth
was
shocked
to
think
that,
however
incapable
of
such
coarseness
of
expression
herself,
the
coarseness
of
the
sentiment
was
little
other
than
her
own
breast
had
harboured
and
fancied
liberal!
As
soon
as
all
had
ate,
and
the
elder
ones
paid,
the
carriage
was
ordered;
and
after
some
contrivance,
the
whole
party,
with
all
their
boxes,
work
bags,
and
parcels,
and
the
unwelcome
addition
