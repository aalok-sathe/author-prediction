account
that
attention
to
Randalls
is
doubly
due,
and
she
must
doubly
feel
the
omission.
Had
she
been
a
person
of
consequence
herself,
he
would
have
come
I
dare
say;
and
it
would
not
have
signified
whether
he
did
or
no.
Can
you
think
your
friend
behindhand
in
these
sort
of
considerations?
Do
you
suppose
she
does
not
often
say
all
this
to
herself?
No,
Emma,
your
amiable
young
man
can
be
amiable
only
in
French,
not
in
English.
He
may
be
very
'amiable,'
have
very
good
manners,
and
be
very
agreeable;
but
he
can
have
no
English
delicacy
towards
the
feelings
of
other
people:
nothing
really
amiable
about
him."
"You
seem
determined
to
think
ill
of
him."
"Me!
not
at
all,"
replied
Mr.
Knightley,
rather
displeased;
"I
do
not
want
to
think
ill
of
him.
I
should
be
as
ready
to
acknowledge
his
merits
as
any
other
man;
but
I
hear
of
none,
except
what
are
merely
personal;
that
he
is
well
grown
and
good
looking,
with
smooth,
plausible
manners."
"Well,
if
he
have
nothing
else
to
recommend
him,
he
will
be
a
treasure
at
Highbury.
We
do
not
often
look
upon
fine
young
men,
well
bred
and
agreeable.
