only
to
shew
off
in
higher
style
her
own
very
superior
performance.
She
was,
besides,
which
was
the
worst
of
all,
so
cold,
so
cautious!
There
was
no
getting
at
her
real
opinion.
Wrapt
up
in
a
cloak
of
politeness,
she
seemed
determined
to
hazard
nothing.
She
was
disgustingly,
was
suspiciously
reserved.
If
any
thing
could
be
more,
where
all
was
most,
she
was
more
reserved
on
the
subject
of
Weymouth
and
the
Dixons
than
any
thing.
She
seemed
bent
on
giving
no
real
insight
into
Mr.
Dixon's
character,
or

approbation
and
smoothness;
nothing
delineated
or

It
did
her
no
service
however.
Her
caution
was
thrown
away.
Emma
saw
its
artifice,
and
returned
to
her
first
surmises.
There
probably
was
something
more
to
conceal
than
her
own
preference;
Mr.
Dixon,
perhaps,
had
been
very
near
changing
one
friend
for
the
other,
or
been
fixed
only
to
Miss
Campbell,
for
the
sake
of
the
future
twelve
thousand
pounds.
The
like
reserve
prevailed
on
other
topics.
She
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
had
been
at
Weymouth
at
the
same
time.
It
was
known
that
