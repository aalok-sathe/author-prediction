you
ever
see
such
dancing?
Was
not
it
delightful?
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill;
I
never
saw
any
thing
equal
to
it."
"Oh!
very
delightful
indeed;
I
can
say
nothing
less,
for
I
suppose
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
are
hearing
every
thing
that
passes.
And
(raising
his
voice
still
more)
I
do
not
see
why
Miss
Fairfax
should
not
be
mentioned
too.
I
think
Miss
Fairfax
dances
very
well;
and
Mrs.
Weston
is
the
very
best
country
dance
player,
without
exception,
in
England.
Now,
if
your
friends
have
any
gratitude,
they
will
say
something
pretty
loud
about
you
and
me
in
return;
but
I
cannot
stay
to
hear
it."
"Oh!
Mr.
Knightley,
one
moment
more;
something
of
consequence
so
shocked!
Jane
and
I
are
both
so
shocked
about
the
apples!"
"What
is
the
matter
now?"
"To
think
of
your
sending
us
all
your
store
apples.
You
said
you
had
a
great
many,
and
now
you
have
not
one
left.
We
really
are
so
shocked!
Mrs.
Hodges
may
well
be
angry.
William
Larkins
mentioned
it
here.
You
should
not
have
done
it,
indeed
you
should
not.
Ah!
he
is
off.
He
never
can
bear
to
be
thanked.
But
