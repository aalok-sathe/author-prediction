ever
suggested
it
before,
but
they
felt
that
there
was
no
other
way
of
accounting
for
such
attentions
from
such
a
quarter
than
by
supposing
a
partiality
for
their
niece.
While
these
newly
born
notions
were
passing
in
their
heads,
the
perturbation
of
Elizabeth's
feelings
was
at
every
moment
increasing.
She
was
quite
amazed
at
her
own
discomposure;
but
amongst
other
causes
of
disquiet,
she
dreaded
lest
the
partiality
of
the
brother
should
have
said
too

saw
such
looks

inquiring

in
her
uncle
and
aunt
as
made
everything
worse.
Miss
Darcy
and
her
brother
appeared,
and
this
formidable
introduction
took
place.
With
astonishment
did
Elizabeth
see
that
her
new
acquaintance
was
at
least
as
much
embarrassed
as
herself.
Since
her
being
at
Lambton,
she
had
heard
that
Miss
Darcy
was
exceedingly
proud;
but
the
observation
of
a
very
few
minutes
convinced
her
that
she
was
only
exceedingly
shy.
She
