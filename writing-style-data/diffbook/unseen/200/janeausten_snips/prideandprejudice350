with
the
knowledge
of
your
ill
opinion,
too!
and
having
to
relate
such
a
thing
of
his
sister!
It
is
really
too
distressing.
I
am
sure
you
must
feel
it
so."
"Oh!
no,
my
regret
and
compassion
are
all

"I

so
deficient
in
the
appearance
of
it
as
you
used

"And

I
meant
to
be
uncommonly
clever
in
taking
so
decided
a
dislike
to
