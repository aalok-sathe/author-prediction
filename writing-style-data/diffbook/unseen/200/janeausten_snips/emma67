indeed,
to
use
your
own
words,
be
an
exquisite
possession."
"But
I
am
afraid,
Mr.
Elton,
Harriet
will
not
like
to
sit.
She
thinks
so
little
of
her
own
beauty.
Did
not
you
observe
her
manner
of
answering
me?
How
completely
it
meant,
'why
should
my
picture
be
drawn?'"
"Oh!
yes,
I
observed
it,
I
assure
you.
It
was
not

Harriet

ever
been
finished,

together
on
the
best
size
for
Harriet.
Her
many
beginnings
were
displayed.
Miniatures,
half
lengths,
whole
lengths,
pencil,
crayon,
and
water
colours
had
been
all
tried
in
turn.
She
had
always
wanted
to
do
every
thing,
and
had
made
more
progress
both
in
drawing
and
music
than
many
might
have
done
with
so
little
labour
as
she
would
ever
submit
to.
She
played
and
sang;
and
