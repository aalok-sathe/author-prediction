due
consideration
for
the
advantage
of
all
your
family,
and
if
my
manner
has
been
at
all
reprehensible,
I
here
beg
leave
to
apologise."
The
discussion
of
Mr.
Collins's
offer
was
now
nearly
at
an
end,
and
Elizabeth
had
only
to
suffer
from
the
uncomfortable
feelings
necessarily
attending
it,
and
occasionally
from
some
peevish
allusions
of
her
mother.
As
for
the
gentleman
himself,
his
feelings
were
chiefly
expressed,
not
by
embarrassment
or
dejection,
or
by
trying
to
avoid
her,
but
by
stiffness
of
manner
and
resentful
silence.
He
scarcely
ever
spoke
to
her,
and
the
assiduous
attentions
which
he
had
been
so
sensible
of
himself
were
transferred
for
the
rest
of
the
day
to
Miss
Lucas,
whose
civility
in
listening
to
him
was
a
seasonable
relief
to
them
all,
and
especially
to
her
friend.
The
morrow
produced
no
abatement
of
Mrs.
Bennet's
ill
humour
or
ill
health.
Mr.
Collins
was
also
in
the
same
state
of
angry
pride.
Elizabeth
had
hoped
that
his
resentment
might
shorten
his
visit,
but
his
plan
did
not
appear
in
the
least
affected
by
it.
He
was
always
to
have
gone
on
Saturday,
and
to
Saturday
he
meant
to
stay.
After
breakfast,
the
girls
walked
