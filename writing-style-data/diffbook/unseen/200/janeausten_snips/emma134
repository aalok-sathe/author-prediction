it
very
attentively.
With
the
view
of
passing
off
an
awkward
moment,
Emma
smilingly
said,
"You
must
make
my
apologies
to
your
friend;
but
so
good
a
charade
must
not
be
confined
to
one
or
two.
He
may
be
sure
of
every
woman's
approbation
while
he
writes
with
such
gallantry."
"I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying,"
replied
Mr.
Elton,
though
hesitating
a
good
deal
while
he
spoke;
"I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
at
least
if
my
friend
feels
at
all
as
I
do
I
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
that,
could
he
see
his
little
effusion
honoured
as
I
see
it,
(looking
at
the
book
again,
and
replacing
it
on
the
table),
he
would
consider
it
as
the
proudest
moment
of
his
life."
After
this
speech
he
was
gone
as
soon
as
possible.
Emma
could
not
think
it
too
soon;
for
with
all
his
good
and
agreeable
qualities,
there
was
a
sort
of
parade
in
his
speeches
which
was
very
apt
to
incline
her
to
laugh.
She
ran
away
to
indulge
the
inclination,
leaving
the
tender
and
the
sublime
of
pleasure
to
Harriet's
share.
Though
now
the
middle
of
December,
there
had
yet
been
no
weather
to
prevent
the
