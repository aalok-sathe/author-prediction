at
Netherfield

twelvemonth.
So
near
a
vicinity
to
her
mother
and
Meryton
relations
was
not
desirable
even
to
his
easy
temper,
or
her
affectionate
heart.
The
darling
wish
of
his
sisters
was
then
gratified;
he
bought
an
estate
in
a
neighbouring
county
to
Derbyshire,
and
Jane
and
Elizabeth,
in
addition
to
every
other
source
of
happiness,
were
within
thirty
miles
of
each
other.
Kitty,
to
her
very
material
advantage,
spent
the
chief
of
her
time
with
her
two
elder
sisters.
In
society
so
superior
to
what
she
had
generally
known,
her
improvement
was
great.
She
was
not

of
Lydia's

she
became,
by
proper
attention
and
management,
less
irritable,
less
ignorant,
and
less
insipid.
From
the
further
disadvantage
of
Lydia's
society
she
was
of
course
carefully
kept,
and
though
Mrs.
Wickham
frequently
invited
her
to
come
and
stay
with
her,
with
the
promise
of
balls
and
young
men,
her
father
would
never
consent
to
her
going.
Mary
was
the
only
daughter
who
remained
at
home;
and
she
was
necessarily
drawn
from
the
pursuit
of
accomplishments
by
Mrs.
Bennet's
being
quite
unable
to
sit
alone.
Mary
