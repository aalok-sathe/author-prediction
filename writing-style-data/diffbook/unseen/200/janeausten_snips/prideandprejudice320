a
few
moments,
she
flattered
herself
that
her
wishes
did
not
err.
But
when
she
read
and
re
read
with
the
closest
attention,
the
particulars
immediately
following
of
Wickham's
resigning
all
pretensions
to
the
living,
of
his
receiving
in
lieu
so
considerable
a
sum
as
three
thousand
pounds,
again
was
she
forced
to
hesitate.
She
put
down
the
letter,
weighed
every
circumstance
with
what
she
meant
to
be
impartiality
deliberated
on
the
probability
of
each
statement
but
with
little
success.
On
both
sides
it
was
only
assertion.
Again
she
read

in
it
less
than
infamous,

capable
of

must
make
him
entirely
blameless
throughout
the
whole.
The
extravagance
and
general
profligacy
which
he
scrupled
not
to
lay
at
Mr.
Wickham's
charge,
exceedingly
shocked
her;
the
more
so,
as
she
could
bring
no
proof
of
its
injustice.
She
had
never
heard
of
him
before
his
entrance
into
the
shire
Militia,
in
which
he
had
engaged
at
the
persuasion
of
the
young
man
who,
on
meeting
him
accidentally
in
town,
had
