regular
meeting.
Weston
and
Cole
will
be
there
too;
but
one
is
apt
to
speak
only
of
those
who
lead.
I
fancy
Mr.
E.
and
Knightley
have
every
thing
their
own
way."
"Have
not
you
mistaken
the
day?"
said
Emma.
"I
am
almost
certain
that
the
meeting
at
the
Crown
is
not
till
to

"Oh!

the

on
Mrs.

"I
do
believe,"

"But

proved
by
the
smallness
of
the
school,
which
I
have
heard
you
speak
of,
as
under
the
patronage
of
your
sister
and
Mrs.
Bragge;
the
only
school,
and
not
more
than
five
and
twenty
children."
"Ah!
you
clever
creature,
that's
very

What
