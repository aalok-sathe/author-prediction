a
Weston
in
merit,
and
a
Churchill
in
fortune.
But
Harriet
Smith
I
have
not
half
done
about
Harriet
Smith.
I
think
her
the
very
worst
sort
of
companion
that
Emma
could
possibly
have.
She
knows
nothing
herself,
and
looks
upon
Emma
as
knowing
every
thing.
She
is
a
flatterer
in
all
her
ways;
and
so
much
the
worse,
because
undesigned.
Her
ignorance
is
hourly
flattery.
How
can
Emma
imagine
she
has
any
thing
to
learn
herself,
while
Harriet
is
presenting
such
a
delightful
inferiority?
And
as
for
Harriet,
I
will
venture
to
say
that
she
cannot
gain
by
the
acquaintance.
Hartfield
will
only
put
her
out
of
conceit
with
all
the
other
places
she
belongs
to.
She
will
grow
just
refined
enough
to
be
uncomfortable
with
those
among
whom
birth
and
circumstances
have
placed
her
home.
I
am
much
mistaken
if
Emma's
doctrines
give
any
strength
of
mind,
or
tend
at
all
to
make
a
girl
adapt
herself
rationally
to
the
varieties
of
her
situation
in
life.
They
only
give
a
little
polish."
"I
either
depend
more
upon
Emma's
good
sense
than
you
do,
or
am
more
anxious
for
her
present
comfort;
for
I
cannot
lament
the
acquaintance.
