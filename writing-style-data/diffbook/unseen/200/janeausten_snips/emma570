"if
I
must
speak
on
this
subject,
there
is
no
denying
that
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
might
have
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
did
not
dream
it
I
am
sure
I
have
sometimes
the
oddest
dreams
in
the
world
but
if
I
am
questioned
about
it,
I
must
acknowledge
that
there
was
such
an
idea
last
spring;
for
Mrs.
Perry
herself
mentioned
it
to
my
mother,
and
the
Coles
knew
of
it
as
well
as
ourselves
but
it
was
quite
a
secret,
known
to
nobody

and
only
thought
of
about
three
days.
Mrs.
Perry
was
very
anxious
that
he
should
have
a
carriage,
and
came
to
my
mother
in
great
spirits
one
morning
because
she
thought
she
had
prevailed.
Jane,
don't
you
remember
grandmama's
telling
us
of
it
when
we
got
home?
I
forget
where
we
had
been
walking
to
very
likely
to
Randalls;
yes,
I
think
it
was
to
Randalls.
Mrs.
Perry
was
always
particularly
fond
of
my
mother
indeed
I
do
not
know
who
is
not
and
she
had
mentioned
it
to
her
in
confidence;
she
had
no
objection
to
her
telling
us,
of
course,
but
it
was
not
to
go
beyond:
and,
from
