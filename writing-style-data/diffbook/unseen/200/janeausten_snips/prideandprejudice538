"The
party
seemed
so
well
selected,
so
suitable
one
with
the
other.
I
hope
we
may
often
meet
again."
Elizabeth
smiled.
"Lizzy,
you
must
not
do
so.
You
must
not
suspect
me.
It
mortifies
me.
I
assure
you
that
I
have
now
learnt
to
enjoy
his
conversation
as
an
agreeable
and
sensible
young
man,
without
having
a
wish
beyond
it.
I
am
perfectly
satisfied,
from
what
his
manners
now
are,
that
he
never
had
any
design
of
engaging
my
affection.
It
is
only
that
he
is
blessed
with
greater
sweetness
of
address,
and
a
stronger
desire
of
generally
pleasing,
than
any
other
man."
"You
are
very
cruel,"
said
her
sister,
"you
will
not
let
me
smile,
and
are
provoking
me
to
it
every
moment."
"How
hard
it
is
in
some
cases
to
be
believed!"
"And
how
impossible
in
others!"
"But
why
should
you
wish
to
persuade
me
that
I
feel
more
than
I
acknowledge?"
"That
is
a
question
which
I
hardly
know
how
to
answer.
We
all
love
to
instruct,
though
we
can
teach
only
what
is
not
worth
knowing.
Forgive
me;
and
if
you
persist
in
indifference,
do
not
make
me
your
confidante."
A
few
days
after
this
visit,
