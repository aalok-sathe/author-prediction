of
an
equal
alliance,
as
to
be
addressing
myself
to
Miss
Smith!
No,
madam,
my
visits
to
Hartfield
have
been
for
yourself
only;
and

encouragement
I
received

"Encouragement!
I
give
you
encouragement!
Sir,
you
have
been
entirely
mistaken
in
supposing
it.
I
have
seen
you

and,
I
trust,
will
not
be
lasting.
I
have
no
thoughts
of
matrimony
at
present."

supplication;
and
in
this
state
of
swelling
resentment,
and
mutually
deep
mortification,
they
had
to
continue
together
a
few
minutes
longer,
for
the
fears
of
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
confined
them
to
a
foot
pace.
If
there
had
not
been
so
much
anger,
