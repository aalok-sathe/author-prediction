visiting
an
opposite
milliner,
watching
the
sentinel
on
guard,
and
dressing
a
salad
and
cucumber.
After
welcoming
their
sisters,
they
triumphantly
displayed
a
table
set
out
with
such
cold
meat
as
an
inn
larder
usually
affords,
exclaiming,
"Is
not
this
nice?
Is
not
this
an
agreeable
surprise?"
"And
we
mean
to
treat
you
all,"
added
Lydia,
"but
you
must
lend
us
the
money,
for
we
have
just
spent
ours
at
the
shop
out
there."
Then,
showing
her
purchases
"Look
here,
I
have
bought
this
bonnet.
I
do
not
think
it
is
very
pretty;
but
I
thought
I
might
as
well
buy
it
as
not.
I
shall
pull
it
to
pieces
as
soon
as
I
get
home,
and
see
if
I
can
make
it
up
any
better."
And
when
her
sisters
abused
it
as
ugly,
she
added,
with
perfect
unconcern,
"Oh!
but
there
were
two
or
three
much
uglier
in
the
shop;
and
when
I
have
bought
some
prettier
coloured
satin
to
trim
it
with
fresh,
I
think
it
will
be
very
tolerable.
Besides,
it
will
not
much
signify
what
one
wears
this
summer,
after
the
shire
have
left
Meryton,
and
they
are
going
in
a
fortnight."
"Are
they
indeed!"
cried
