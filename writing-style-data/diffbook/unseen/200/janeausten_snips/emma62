will
keep
my
ill
humour
to
myself.
I
have
a
very
sincere
interest
in
Emma.
Isabella
does
not
seem
more
my
sister;
has
never
excited
a
greater
interest;
perhaps
hardly
so
great.
There
is
an
anxiety,
a
curiosity
in
what
one
feels
for
Emma.
I
wonder
what
will
become
of
her!"
"So
do
I,"
said
Mrs.
Weston
gently,
"very
much."
"She
always
declares
she
will
never
marry,
which,
of
course,
means
just
nothing
at
all.
But
I
have
no
idea
that
she
has
yet
ever
seen
a
man
she
cared
for.
It
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
for
her
to
be
very
much
in
love
with
a
proper
object.
I
should
like
to
see
Emma
in
love,
and
in
some
doubt
of
a
return;
it
would
do
her
good.
But
there
is
nobody
hereabouts
to
attach
her;
and
she
goes
so
seldom
from
home."
"There
does,
indeed,
seem
as
little
to
tempt
her
to
break
her
resolution
at
present,"
said
Mrs.
Weston,
"as
can
well
be;
and
while
she
is
so
happy
at
Hartfield,
I
cannot
wish
her
to
be
forming
any
attachment
which
would
be
creating
such
difficulties
on
poor
Mr.
Woodhouse's
account.
I
do
not
recommend
matrimony
