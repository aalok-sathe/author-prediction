creature,
and
surrounded
with
blessings
in
such
an
excellent
mother,
and
so
many
good
neighbours
and
friends,
and
a
home
that
wanted
for
nothing.
The
simplicity
and
cheerfulness
of
her
nature,
her
contented
and
grateful
spirit,
were
a
recommendation
to
every
body,
and
a
mine
of
felicity
to
herself.
She
was
a
great
talker
upon
little
matters,
which
exactly
suited
Mr.

Goddard
was
the

of
a
School
not
of
a

and
where
girls
might
be
sent
to
be

and
scramble
themselves
into
a
little

without
any
danger
of

Mrs.
Goddard's
school

high
repute
and
very
deservedly;
for
Highbury
was
reckoned
a
particularly
healthy

she
