hold
in
common
sense.
She
is
not
to
pay
for
the
offence
of
others,
by
being
held
below
the
level
of
those
with
whom
she
is
brought
up.
There
can
scarcely
be
a
doubt
that
her
father
is
a
gentleman
and
a
gentleman
of
fortune.
Her
allowance
is
very
liberal;
nothing
has
ever
been
grudged
for
her
improvement
or
comfort.
That
she
is
a
gentleman's
daughter,
is
indubitable
to
me;
that
she
associates
with
gentlemen's
daughters,
no
one,
I
apprehend,
will
deny.
She
is
superior
to
Mr.
Robert
Martin."
"Whoever
might
be
her
parents,"
said
Mr.
Knightley,
"whoever
may
have
had
the
charge
of
her,
it
does
not
appear
to
have
been
any
part
of
their
plan
to
introduce
her
into
what
you
would
call
good
society.
After
receiving
a
very
indifferent
education
she
is
left
in
Mrs.
Goddard's
hands
to
shift
as
she
can;
to
move,
in
short,
in
Mrs.
Goddard's
line,
to
have
Mrs.
Goddard's
acquaintance.
Her
friends
evidently
thought
this
good
enough
for
her;
and
it
was
good
enough.
She
desired
nothing
better
herself.
Till
you
chose
to
turn
her
into
a
friend,
her
mind
had
no
distaste
for
her
own
set,
nor
any
ambition
beyond
it.
