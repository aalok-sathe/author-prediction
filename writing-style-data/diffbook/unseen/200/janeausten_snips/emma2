just
what
she
liked;
highly
esteeming
Miss
Taylor's
judgment,
but
directed
chiefly
by
her
own.
The
real
evils,
indeed,
of
Emma's
situation
were
the
power
of
having
rather
too
much
her
own
way,
and
a
disposition
to
think
a
little
too
well
of
herself;
these
were
the
disadvantages
which
threatened
alloy
to
her
many
enjoyments.
The
danger,
however,
was
at
present
so
unperceived,
that
they
did
not
by
any
means
rank
as
misfortunes
with
her.
Sorrow
came
a
gentle
sorrow
but
not
at
all
in
the
shape
of
any
disagreeable
consciousness.
Miss
Taylor
married.
It
was
Miss
Taylor's
loss
which
first
brought
grief.
It
was
on
the
wedding
day
of
this
beloved
friend
that
Emma
first
sat
in
mournful
thought
of
any
continuance.
The
wedding
over,
and
the
bride
people
gone,
her
father
and
herself
were
left
to
dine
together,
with
no
prospect
of
a
third
to
cheer
a
long
evening.
Her
father
composed
himself
to
sleep
after
dinner,
as
usual,
and
she
had
then
only
to
sit
and
think
of
what
she
had
lost.
The
event
had
every
promise
of
happiness
for
her
friend.
Mr.
Weston
was
a
man
of
unexceptionable
character,
easy
fortune,
suitable
age,
and
pleasant
manners;
