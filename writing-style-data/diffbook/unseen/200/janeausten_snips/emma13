pleasure.
Every
friend
of
Miss
Taylor
must
be
glad
to
have
her
so
happily
married."
"And
you
have
forgotten
one
matter
of
joy
to
me,"
said
Emma,
"and
a
very
considerable
one
that
I
made
the
match
myself.
I
made
the
match,
you
know,
four
years
ago;
and
to
have
it
take
place,
and
be
proved
in
the
right,
when
so
many
people
said
Mr.
Weston
would
never
marry
again,
may
comfort
me
for
any
thing."
Mr.
Knightley
shook
his
head
at
her.
Her
father
fondly
replied,
"Ah!
my
dear,
I
wish
you
would
not
make
matches
and
foretell
things,
for
whatever
you
say
always
comes
to
pass.
Pray
do
not
make
any
more
matches."
"I
promise
you
to
make
none
for
myself,
papa;
but
I
must,
indeed,
for
other
people.
It
is
the
greatest
amusement
in
the
world!
And
after
such
success,
you
know!
Every
body
said
that
Mr.
Weston
would
never
marry
again.
Oh
dear,
no!
Mr.
Weston,
who
had
been
a
widower
so
long,
and
who
seemed
so
perfectly
comfortable
without
a
wife,
so
constantly
occupied
either
in
his
business
in
town
or
among
his
friends
here,
always
acceptable
wherever
he
went,
always
cheerful
Mr.
Weston
need
