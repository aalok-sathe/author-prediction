comes,
not
to
see
Miss
Taylor
here!"
"She
will
not
be
surprized,
papa,
at
least."
"I
do
not
know,
my
dear.
I
am
sure
I
was
very
much
surprized
when
I
first
heard
she
was
going
to
be
married."
"We
must
ask
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
to
dine
with
us,
while
Isabella
is
here."
"Yes,
my
dear,
if
there
is
time.
But
(in
a
very
depressed
tone)
she
is
coming
for
only
one
week.
There
will
not
be
time
for
any
thing."
"It
is
unfortunate
that
they
cannot
stay
longer
but
it
seems
a
case
of
necessity.
Mr.
John
Knightley
must
be
in
town
again
on
the
28th,
and
we
ought
to
be
thankful,
papa,
that
we
are
to
have
the
whole
of
the
time
they
can
give
to
the
country,
that
two
or
three
days
are
not
to
be
taken
out
for
the
Abbey.
Mr.
Knightley
promises
to
give
up
his
claim
this
Christmas
though
you
know
it
is
longer
since
they
were
with
him,
than
with
us."
"It
would
be
very
hard,
indeed,
my
dear,
if
poor
Isabella
were
to
be
anywhere
but
at
Hartfield."
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
never
allow
for
Mr.
Knightley's
claims
on
his
brother,
or
