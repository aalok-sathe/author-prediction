often
did,
to
spend
his
evening
at
Hartfield.
Emma
and
Harriet
were
going
to
walk;
he
joined
them;
and,
on
returning,
they
fell
in
with
a
larger
party,
who,
like
themselves,
judged
it
wisest
to
take
their
exercise
early,
as
the
weather
threatened
rain;
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
and
their
son,
Miss
Bates
and
her
niece,
who
had
accidentally

his
horse.
"By

said
Frank
Churchill
to
Mrs.
Weston
presently,
"what
became
of
Mr.
Perry's
plan
of
setting
up
his
carriage?"
Mrs.
Weston
looked
surprized,
and
said,
"I
did
not
know
that
he
ever
had
any
such
plan."
"Nay,
I
had
