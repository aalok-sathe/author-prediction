deal
of
consideration.
One
cannot
resolve
upon
them
in
a
hurry.
If
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
will
be
so
obliging
as
to
call
here
one
morning,
we
may
talk
it
over,
and
see
what
can
be
done."
"But,
unfortunately,
sir,
my
time
is
so
limited
"
"Oh!"
interrupted
Emma,
"there
will
be
plenty
of
time
for
talking
every
thing
over.
There
is
no
hurry
at
all.
If
it
can
be
contrived
to
be
at
the
Crown,
papa,
it
will
be
very
convenient
for
the
horses.
They
will
be
so
near
their
own
stable."
"So
they
will,
my
dear.
That
is
a
great
thing.
Not
that
James
ever
complains;
but
it
is
right
to
spare
our
horses
when
we
can.
If
I
could
be
sure
of
the
rooms
being
thoroughly
aired
but
is
Mrs.
Stokes
to
be
trusted?
I
doubt
it.
I
do
not
know
her,
even
by
sight."
"I
can
answer
for
every
thing
of
that
nature,
sir,
because
it
will
be
under
Mrs.
Weston's
care.
Mrs.
Weston
undertakes
to
direct
the
whole."
"There,
papa!
Now
you
must
be
satisfied
Our
own
dear
Mrs.
Weston,
who
is
carefulness
itself.
Do
not
you
remember
what
Mr.
Perry
said,
so
many
years
