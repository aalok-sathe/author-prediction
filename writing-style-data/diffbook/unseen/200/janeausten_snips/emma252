pleasure
to
her
a
letter
from
Jane
that
she
can
never
hear
it
often
enough;
so
I
knew
it
could
not
be
far
off,
and
here
it
is,
only
just
under
my
huswife
and
since
you
are
so
kind
as
to
wish
to
hear
what
she
says;
but,
first
of
all,
I
really
must,
in
justice
to
Jane,
apologise
for
her
writing
so
short
a
letter
only
two
pages
you
see
hardly
two
and
in
general
she
fills
the
whole
paper
and
crosses
half.
My
mother
often
wonders
that
I
can
make
it
out
so
well.
She
often
says,
when
the
letter
is
first
opened,
'Well,
Hetty,
now
I
think
you
will
be
put
to
it
to
make
out
all
that
checker
work'
don't
you,
ma'am?
And
then
I
tell
her,
I
am
sure
she
would
contrive
to
make
it
out
herself,
if
she
had
nobody
to
do
it
for
her
every
word
of
it
I
am
sure
she
would
pore
over
it
till
she
had
made
out
every
word.
And,
indeed,
though
my
mother's
eyes
are
not
so
good
as
they
were,
she
can
see
amazingly
well
still,
thank
God!
with
the
help
of
spectacles.
It
is
