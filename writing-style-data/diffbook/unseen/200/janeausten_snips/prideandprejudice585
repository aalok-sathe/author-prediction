down

table.
She
had
only
to
say
in
reply,
that
they
had
wandered
about,
till
she
was
beyond
her
own
knowledge.
She
coloured
as
she
spoke;
but
neither
that,
nor
anything
else,
awakened
a
suspicion
of
the
truth.
The
evening
passed
quietly,
unmarked
by
anything
extraordinary.
The
acknowledged
lovers
talked
and
