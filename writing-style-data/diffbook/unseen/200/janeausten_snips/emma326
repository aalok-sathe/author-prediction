laughed.
"I
cannot
separate
Miss
Fairfax
and
her
complexion."
"Did
you
see
her
often
at
Weymouth?
Were
you
often
in
the
same
society?"
At
this
moment
they
were
approaching
Ford's,
and
he
hastily
exclaimed,
"Ha!
this
must
be
the
very
shop
that
every
body
attends
every
day
of
their
lives,
as
my
father
informs
me.
He
comes
to
Highbury
himself,

in
Highbury.
You
were
very
popular
before
you
came,
because
you
were
Mr.
Weston's
son
but
lay
out
half
a
guinea
at
Ford's,
and
your
popularity
will
stand
upon
your
own
virtues."
They
went
in;
and
while
the
sleek,
well
tied
parcels
of
"Men's
Beavers"
and
"York
Tan"
were
bringing
down
and
displaying
on
the
counter,
he
said
"But
