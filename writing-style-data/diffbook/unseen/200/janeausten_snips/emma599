and
distress.
Some
are
gone
to
the
ponds,
and
some
to
the
lime
walk.
Till
they
all
come
in
I
shall
not
be
missed;
and
when
they
do,
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
say
that
I
am
gone?"
"Certainly,
if
you
wish
it;
but

"But

and
Emma
very
feelingly
replied,
"That
can
be
no
reason
for
your
being
exposed
to
danger
now.
I
must
order
the
carriage.
The
heat
even

You
are
fatigued
already."
"I

but
it
is
