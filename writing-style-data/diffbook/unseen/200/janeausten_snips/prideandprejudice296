explanation."
Mr.
Darcy,
who
was
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
face,
seemed
to
catch
her
words
with
no
less
resentment
than
surprise.
His
complexion
became
pale
with
anger,
and
the
disturbance
of
his
mind
was
visible
in
every
feature.
He
was
struggling
for
the
appearance
of
composure,
and
would
not
open
his
lips
till
he
believed
himself
to
have
attained
it.
The
pause
was
to
Elizabeth's
feelings
dreadful.
At
length,
with
a
voice
of
forced
calmness,
he
said:
"And
this
is
all
the
reply
which
I
am
to
have
the
honour
of
expecting!
I
might,
perhaps,
wish
to
be
informed
why,
with
so
little
endeavour
at
civility,
I
am
thus
rejected.
But
it
is
of
small
importance."
"I
might
as
well
inquire,"
replied
she,
"why
with
so
evident
a
desire
of
offending
and
insulting
me,
you
chose
to
tell
me
that
you
liked
me
against
your
will,
against
your
reason,
and
even
against
your
character?
Was
not
this
some
excuse
for
incivility,
if
I
was
uncivil?
But
I
have
other
provocations.
You
know
I
have.
Had
not
my
feelings
decided
against
you
had
they
been
indifferent,
or
had
they
even
been
favourable,
do
you
think
