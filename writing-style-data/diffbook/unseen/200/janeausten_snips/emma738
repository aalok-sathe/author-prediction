But
that
would
not
do.
Mr.
Weston
was
to
call
in
the
evening,
and
she
must
return
it
by
him.
"I
would
rather
be
talking
to
you,"
he
replied;
"but
as
it
seems
a
matter
of
justice,
it
shall
be
done."
He
began
stopping,
however,
almost
directly
to
say,
"Had
I
been
offered
the
sight
of
one
of
this
gentleman's
letters
to
his
mother
in
law
a
few
months
ago,
Emma,
it
would
not
have
been
taken
with
such
indifference."
He
proceeded
a
little
farther,
reading
to
himself;
and
then,
with
a
smile,
observed,
"Humph!
a
fine
complimentary
opening:
But
it
is
his
way.
One
man's
style
must
not
be
the
rule
of
another's.
We
will
not
be
severe."
"It
will
be
natural
for
me,"
he
added
shortly
afterwards,
"to
speak
my
opinion
aloud
as
I
read.
By
doing
it,
I
shall
feel
that
I
am
near
you.
It
will
not
be
so
great
a
loss
of
time:
but
if
you
dislike
it
"
"Not
at
all.
I
should
wish
it."
Mr.
Knightley
returned
to
his
reading
with
greater
alacrity.
"He
trifles
here,"
said
he,
"as
to
the
temptation.
He
knows
he
is
wrong,
and
has
nothing
rational
to
urge.
