you
know,
and
as
if
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do;
and
so
he
came
and
spoke,
and
I
answered
and
I
stood
for
a
minute,
feeling
dreadfully,
you
know,
one
can't
tell
how;
and
then
I
took
courage,
and
said
it
did
not
rain,
and
I
must
go;
and
so
off
I
set;
and
I
had
not
got
three
yards
from
the
door,
when
he
came
after
me,
only
to
say,
if
I
was
going
to
Hartfield,
he
thought
I
had
much
better
go
round
by
Mr.
Cole's
stables,
for
I
should
find
the
near
way
quite
floated
by
this
rain.
Oh!
dear,
I
thought
it
would
have
been
the
death
of
me!
So
I
said,
I
was
very
much
obliged
to
him:
you
know
I
could
not
do
less;
and
then
he
went
back
to
Elizabeth,
and
I
came
round
by
the
stables
I
believe
I
did
but
I
hardly
knew
where
I
was,
or
any
thing
about
it.
Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
I
would
rather
done
any
thing
than
have
it
happen:
and
yet,
you
know,
there
was
a
sort
of
satisfaction
in
seeing
him
behave
so
pleasantly
and
so
kindly.
And
Elizabeth,
too.
Oh!
Miss
