that
Bingley
had
received
his
sanction
to
be
happy,
had
she
not
seen
his
eyes
likewise
turned
towards
Mr.
Darcy,
with
an
expression
of
half
laughing
alarm.
His
behaviour
to
her
sister
was
such,
during
dinner
time,
as
showed
an
admiration
of
her,
which,
though
more
guarded
than
formerly,
persuaded
Elizabeth,
that
if
left
wholly
to
himself,
Jane's
happiness,
and
his
own,
would
be
speedily
secured.
Though
she
dared
not
depend
upon
the
consequence,
she
yet
received
pleasure
from
observing
his
behaviour.
It
gave
her
all
the
animation
that
her
spirits
could
boast;
for
she
was
in
no
cheerful
humour.
Mr.
Darcy
was
almost
as
far
from
her
as
the
table
could
divide
them.
He
was
on
one
side
of
her
mother.
She
knew
how
little
such
a
situation
would
give
pleasure
to
either,
or
make
either
appear
to
advantage.
She
was
not
near
enough
to
hear
any
of
their
discourse,
but
she
could
see
how
seldom
they
spoke
to
each
other,
and
how
formal
and
cold
was
their
manner
whenever
they
did.
Her
mother's
ungraciousness,
made
the
sense
of
what
they
owed
him
more
painful
to
Elizabeth's
mind;
and
she
would,
at
times,
have
given
anything
to
be
privileged
