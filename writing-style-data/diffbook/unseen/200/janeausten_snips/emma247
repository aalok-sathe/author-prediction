man,
only
because
he
appeared
to
be
of
a
different
disposition
from
himself,
was
unworthy
the
real
liberality
of
mind
which
she
was
always
used
to
acknowledge
in
him;
for
with
all
the
high
opinion
of
himself,
which
she
had
often
laid
to
his
charge,
she
had
never
before
for
a
moment
supposed
it
could
make
him
unjust
to
the

Emma
and
Harriet
had
been
walking
together
one
morning,
and,
in
Emma's
opinion,

and
receiving
no
other
answer
than
a
very
plaintive
"Mr.
Elton
is
so
good
to
the
poor!"
she
found
something
else
must
be
done.
They
were
just
approaching
the
house
where
lived
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates.
She
determined
to
call
upon
them
and
seek
safety
in
numbers.
There
was
always
sufficient
reason
for
such
an
attention;
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
loved
to
be
