her
embarrassment;
and
every
idea
of
the
impropriety
of
her
being
found
there
recurring
to
her
mind,
the
few
minutes
in
which
they
continued
were
some
of
the
most
uncomfortable
in
her
life.
Nor
did
he
seem
much
more
at
ease;
when
he
spoke,
his
accent
had
none
of
its
usual
sedateness;
and
he
repeated
his
inquiries
as
to
the
time
of
her
having
left
Longbourn,
and
of
her
having
stayed
in
Derbyshire,
so
often,
and
in
so
hurried
a
way,
as
plainly
spoke
the
distraction
of
his
thoughts.
At
length
every
idea
seemed
to
fail
him;
and,
after
standing
a
few
moments
without
saying
a
word,
he
suddenly
recollected
himself,
and
took
leave.
The
others
then
joined
her,
and
expressed
admiration
of
his
figure;
but
Elizabeth
heard
not
a
word,
and
wholly
engrossed
by
her
own
feelings,
followed
them
in
silence.
She
was
overpowered
by
shame
and
vexation.
Her
coming
there
was
the
most
unfortunate,
the
most
ill
judged
thing
in
the
world!
How
strange
it
must
appear
to
him!
In
what
a
disgraceful
light
might
it
not
strike
so
vain
a
man!
It
might
seem
as
if
she
had
purposely
thrown
herself
in
his
way
again!
Oh!
why
