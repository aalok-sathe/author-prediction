back
as
well
as
she
could;
but
it
was
all
confusion.
She
had
taken
up
the
idea,
she
supposed,
and
made
every
thing
bend
to
it.
His
manners,
however,
must
have
been
unmarked,
wavering,
dubious,
or
she
could
not
have
been
so
misled.
The
picture!
How
eager
he
had
been
about
the
picture!
and
the
charade!
and
an
hundred
other
circumstances;
how
clearly
they
had
seemed
to
point
at
Harriet.
To
be
sure,
the
charade,
with
its
"ready
wit"
but
then
the
"soft
eyes"
in
fact
it
suited
neither;
it
was
a
jumble
without
taste
or
truth.
Who
could
have
seen
through
such
thick
headed
nonsense?
Certainly
she
had
often,
especially
of
late,
thought
his
manners
to
herself
unnecessarily
gallant;
but
it
had
passed
as
his
way,
as
a
mere
error
of
judgment,
of
knowledge,
of
taste,
as
one
proof
among
others
that
he
had
not
always
lived
in
the
best
society,
that
with
all
the
gentleness
of
his
address,
true
elegance
was
sometimes
wanting;
but,
till
this
very
day,
she
had
never,
for
an
instant,
suspected
it
to
mean
any
thing
but
grateful
respect
to
her
as
Harriet's
friend.
To
Mr.
John
Knightley
was
she
indebted
for
her
first
