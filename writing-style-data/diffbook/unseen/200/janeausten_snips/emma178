together.
Emma
was
just
describing
the
nature
of
her
friend's
complaint;
"a
throat
very
much
inflamed,
with
a
great
deal
of
heat
about
her,
a
quick,
low
pulse,
&c.
and
she
was
sorry
to
find
from
Mrs.
Goddard
that
Harriet
was
liable
to
very
bad
sore
throats,
and
had
often
alarmed
her
with
them."
Mr.

experience
and
care;
but
as
there
must
still
remain
a
degree
of
uneasiness
which
she
could
not
wish
to
reason
away,
which
she
would
rather
feed
and
assist
than
not,
she
added
soon
afterwards
as
if
quite
another
subject,
"It
is
so
cold,
so
very
cold
and
looks
and
feels
so
very
much
like
snow,
that

it
were
to
any

party,
