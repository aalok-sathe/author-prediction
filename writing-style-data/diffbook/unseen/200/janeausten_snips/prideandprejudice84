advantage
in
walking;
if
the
first,
I
would
be
completely
in
your
way,
and
if
the
second,
I
can
admire
you
much
better
as
I
sit
by
the
fire."
"Oh!
shocking!"
cried
Miss
Bingley.
"I
never
heard
anything
so
abominable.
How
shall
we
punish
him
for
such
a
speech?"
"Nothing
so
easy,
if
you
have
but
the
inclination,"
said
Elizabeth.
"We
can
all
plague
and
punish
one
another.
Tease
him
laugh
at
him.
Intimate
as
you
are,
you
must
know
how
it
is
to
be
done."
"But
upon
my
honour,
I
do
not.
I
do
assure
you
that
my
intimacy
has
not
yet
taught
me
that.
Tease
calmness
of
manner
and
presence
of
mind!
No,
no;
I
feel
he
may
defy
us
there.
And
as
to
laughter,
we
will
not
expose
ourselves,
if
you
please,
by
attempting
to
laugh
without
a
subject.
Mr.
Darcy
may
hug
himself."
"Mr.
Darcy
is
not
to
be
laughed
at!"
cried
Elizabeth.
"That
is
an
uncommon
advantage,
and
uncommon
I
hope
it
will
continue,
for
it
would
be
a
great
loss
to
me
to
have
many
such
acquaintances.
I
dearly
love
a
laugh."
"Miss
Bingley,"
said
he,
"has
given
me
more
credit
than
can
be.
