degree
of
credit.
Indeed,
Mr.
Darcy,
it
is
very
ungenerous
in
you
to
mention
all
that
you
knew
to
my
disadvantage
in
Hertfordshire
and,
give
me
leave
to
say,
very
impolitic
too
for
it
is
provoking
me
to
retaliate,
and
such
things
may
come
out
as
will
shock
your
relations
to
hear."
"I
am
not
afraid
of
you,"
said
he,
smilingly.
"Pray
let
me
hear
what
you
have
to
accuse
him
of,"
cried
Colonel
Fitzwilliam.
"I
should
like
to
know
how
he
behaves
among
strangers."
"You
shall
hear
then
but
prepare
yourself
for
something
very
dreadful.
The
first
time
of
my
ever
seeing
him
in
Hertfordshire,
you
must
know,
was
at
a
ball
and
at
this
ball,
what
do
you
think
he
did?
He
danced
only
four
dances,
though
gentlemen
were
scarce;
and,
to
my
certain
knowledge,
more
than
one
young
lady
was
sitting
down
in
want
of
a
partner.
Mr.
Darcy,
you
cannot
deny
the
fact."
"I
had
not
at
that
time
the
honour
of
knowing
any
lady
in
the
assembly
beyond
my
own
party."
"True;
and
nobody
can
ever
be
introduced
in
a
ball
room.
Well,
Colonel
Fitzwilliam,
what
do
I
play
next?
My
fingers
wait
your
orders."
