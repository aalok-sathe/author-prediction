Miss
Smith.
My
first
displays
the
wealth
and
pomp
of
kings,
Lords
of
the
earth!
their
luxury
and
ease.
That
is
court.
Another
view
of
man,
my
second
brings;
Behold
him
there,
the
monarch
of
the
seas!
That
is
ship;
plain
as
it
can
be.
Now
for
the
cream.
But
ah!
united,
(courtship,
you
know,)
what
reverse
we
have!
Man's
boasted
power
and
freedom,
all
are
flown.
Lord
of
the
earth
and
sea,
he
bends
a
slave,
And
woman,
lovely
woman,
reigns
alone.
A
very
proper
compliment!
and
then
follows
the
application,
which
I
think,
my
dear
Harriet,
you
cannot
find
much
difficulty
in
comprehending.
Read
it
in
comfort
to
yourself.
There
can
be
no
doubt
of
its
being
written
for
you
and
to
you."
Harriet
could
not
long
resist
so
delightful
a
persuasion.
She
read
the
concluding
lines,
and
was
all
flutter
and
happiness.
She
could
not
speak.
But
she
was
not
wanted
to
speak.
It
was
enough
for
her
to
feel.
Emma
spoke
for
her.
"There
is
so
pointed,
and
so
particular
a
meaning
in
this
compliment,"
said
she,
"that
I
cannot
have
a
doubt
as
to
Mr.
Elton's
intentions.
You
are
his
object
and
you
will
soon
