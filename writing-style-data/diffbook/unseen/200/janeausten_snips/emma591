washed
by
a
stream,
of
which
the
Abbey,
with
all
the
old
neglect
of
prospect,
had
scarcely
a
sight
and
its
abundance
of
timber
in
rows
and
avenues,
which
neither
fashion
nor
extravagance
had
rooted
up.
The
house
was
larger
than
Hartfield,
and
totally
unlike
it,
covering
a
good
deal
of
ground,
rambling
and
irregular,
with
many
comfortable,
and
one
or
two
handsome
rooms.
It
was
just
what
it
ought
to
be,
and
it
looked
what
it
was
and
Emma
felt
an
increasing
respect
for
it,
as
the
residence
of
a
family
of
such
true
gentility,
untainted
in
blood
and
understanding.
Some
faults
of
temper
John
Knightley
had;
but
Isabella
had
connected
herself
unexceptionably.
She
had
given
them
neither
men,
nor
names,
nor
places,
that
could
raise
a
blush.
These
were
pleasant
feelings,
and
she
walked
about
and
indulged
them
till
it
was
necessary
to
do
as
the
others
did,
and
collect
round
the
strawberry
beds.
The
whole
party
were
assembled,
excepting
Frank
Churchill,
who
was
expected
every
moment
from
Richmond;
and
Mrs.
Elton,
in
all
her
apparatus
of
happiness,
her
large
bonnet
and
her
basket,
was
very
ready
to
lead
the
way
in
gathering,
accepting,
or
talking
strawberries,
and
