and
thirty
hours
after
his
return.
A
sudden
seizure
of
a
different
nature
from
any
thing
foreboded
by
her
general
state,
had
carried
her
off
after
a
short
struggle.
The
great
Mrs.
Churchill
was
no
more.
It
was
felt
as
such
things
must
be
felt.

before
to
be
seriously
ill.
The
event
acquitted
her
of
all
the
fancifulness,
and
all
the
selfishness
of
imaginary
complaints.
"Poor
Mrs.
Churchill!
no
doubt
she
had
been
suffering
a
great
deal:
more
than
any
body
had
ever
supposed

continual
pain
would
try

It
was
a
