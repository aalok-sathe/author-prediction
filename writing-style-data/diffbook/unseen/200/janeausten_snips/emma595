front,
and
the
river
making
a
close
and
handsome
curve
around
it.
It
was
a
sweet
view
sweet
to
the
eye
and
the
mind.
English
verdure,
English
culture,
English
comfort,
seen
under
a
sun
bright,
without
being
oppressive.
In
this
walk
Emma
and
Mr.
Weston
found
all
the
others
assembled;
and
towards
this
view
she
immediately
perceived
Mr.
Knightley
and
Harriet
distinct
from
the
rest,
quietly
leading
the
way.
Mr.
Knightley
and
Harriet!
It
was
an
odd
tete
a
tete;
but
she
was
glad
to
see
it.
There
had
been
a
time
when
he
would
have
scorned
her
as
a
companion,
and
turned
from
her
with
little
ceremony.
Now
they
seemed
in
pleasant
conversation.
There
had
been
a
time
also
when
Emma
would
have
been
sorry
to
see
Harriet
in
a
spot
so
favourable
for
the
Abbey
Mill
Farm;
but
now
she
feared
it
not.
It
might
be
safely
viewed
with
all
its
appendages
of
prosperity
and
beauty,
its
rich
pastures,
spreading
flocks,
orchard
in
blossom,
and
light
column
of
smoke
ascending.
She
joined
them
at
the
wall,
and
found
them
more
engaged
in
talking
than
in
looking
around.
He
was
giving
Harriet
information
as
to
modes
of
agriculture,
etc.
