her
expressions.
'I
will
not
say,
that
since
I
entered
into
the
engagement
I
have
not
had
some
happy
moments;
but
I
can
say,
that
I
have
never
known
the
blessing
of
one
tranquil
hour:'
and
the
quivering
lip,
Emma,
which
uttered
it,
was
an
attestation
that
I
felt
at
my
heart."
"Poor
girl!"
said
Emma.
"She
thinks
herself
wrong,
then,
for
having
consented
to
a
private
engagement?"
"Wrong!
No
one,
I
believe,
can
blame
her
more
than
she
is
disposed
to
blame
herself.
'The
consequence,'
said
she,
'has
been
a
state
of
perpetual
suffering
to
me;
and
so
it
ought.
But
after
all
the
punishment
that
misconduct
can
bring,
it
is
still
not
less
misconduct.
Pain
is
no
expiation.
I
never
can
be
blameless.
I
have
been
acting
contrary
to
all
my
sense
of
right;
and
the
fortunate
turn
that
every
thing
has
taken,
and
the
kindness
I
am
now
receiving,
is
what
my
conscience
tells
me
ought
not
to
be.'
'Do
not
imagine,
madam,'
she
continued,
'that
I
was
taught
wrong.
Do
not
let
any
reflection
fall
on
the
principles
or
the
care
of
the
friends
who
brought
me
up.
The
error
has
been
all
my
own;
and
