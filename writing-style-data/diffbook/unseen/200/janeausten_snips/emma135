young
ladies
from
tolerably
regular
exercise;
and
on
the
morrow,
Emma
had
a
charitable
visit
to
pay
to
a
poor
sick
family,
who
lived
a
little
way
out
of
Highbury.
Their
road
to
this
detached
cottage
was
down
Vicarage
Lane,
a
lane
leading
at
right
angles
from
the
broad,
though
irregular,
main
street
of
the
place;
and,
as
may
be
inferred,
containing
the
blessed
abode
of
Mr.
Elton.
A
few
inferior
dwellings
were
first
to
be
passed,
and
then,
about
a
quarter
of
a

down
the
lane

It
had
no
advantage
of
situation;
but

by
the
present
proprietor;
and,
such
as
it
was,
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
the
two
friends
passing
it
without
a
slackened
pace
and
observing
eyes.
Emma's
remark
was
"There
it
is.
There
go
you
and
your
riddle
book
one
of
these
days."
Harriet's
was
"Oh,
what
a
sweet
house!
How
very
beautiful!
There
are
the
yellow
curtains
that
Miss
Nash
admires
so
much."
"I
do
not
often
walk
this
way
now,"
said
Emma,
as
they
proceeded,
"but
