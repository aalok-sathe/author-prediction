introduced
to
her.
When
the
Campbells
are
returned,
we
shall
meet
them
in
London,
and
continue
there,
I
trust,
till
we
may
carry
her
northward.
But
now,
I
am
at
such
a
distance
from
her
is
not
it
hard,
Miss
Woodhouse?
Till
this
morning,
we
have
not
once
met
since
the
day
of
reconciliation.
Do
not
you
pity
me?"
Emma
spoke
her
pity
so
very
kindly,
that
with
a
sudden
accession
of
gay
thought,
he
cried,
"Ah!
by
the
bye,"
then
sinking
his
voice,
and
looking
demure
for
the
moment
"I
hope
Mr.
Knightley
is
well?"
He
paused.
She
coloured
and
laughed.
"I
know
you
saw
my
letter,
and
think
you
may
remember
my
wish
in
your
favour.
Let
me
return
your
congratulations.
I
assure
you
that
I
have
heard
the
news
with
the
warmest
interest
and
satisfaction.
He
is
a
man
whom
I
cannot
presume
to
praise."
Emma
was
delighted,
and
only
wanted
him
to
go
on
in
the
same
style;
but
his
mind
was
the
next
moment
in
his
own
concerns
and
with
his
own
Jane,
and
his
next
words
were,
"Did
you
ever
see
such
a
skin?
such
smoothness!
such
delicacy!
and
yet
without
being
actually
fair.
