in
his
being
so
at
last.
Do
not
beat
me."
Every
body
in
and
about
Highbury
who
had
ever
visited
Mr.
Elton,
was
disposed
to
pay
him
attention
on
his
marriage.
Dinner
parties
and
evening
parties
were
made
for
him
and
his
lady;
and
invitations
flowed
in
so
fast
that
she
had
soon
the
pleasure
of
apprehending
they
were
never
to
have
a
disengaged
day.
"I
see
how
it
is,"
said
she.
"I
see
what
a
life
I
am
to
lead
among
you.
Upon
my
word
we
shall
be
absolutely
dissipated.
We
really
seem
quite
the
fashion.
If
this
is
living
in
the
country,
it
is
nothing
very
formidable.
From
Monday
next
to
Saturday,
I
assure
you
we
have
not
a
disengaged
day!
A
woman
with
fewer
resources
than
I
have,
need
not
have
been
at
a
loss."
No
invitation
came
amiss
to
her.
Her
Bath
habits
made
evening
parties
perfectly
natural
to
her,
and
Maple
Grove
had
given
her
a
taste
for
dinners.
She
was
a
little
shocked
at
the
want
of
two
drawing
rooms,
at
the
poor
attempt
at
rout
cakes,
and
there
being
no
ice
in
the
Highbury
card
parties.
