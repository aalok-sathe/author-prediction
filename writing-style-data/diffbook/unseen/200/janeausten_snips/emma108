his
own
cause,
gave
alarming
ideas.
The
dread
of
such
a
failure
after
all
became
the
prominent
uneasiness;
and
when
Harriet
appeared,
and
in
very
good
spirits,
and
without
having
any
such
reason
to
give
for
her
long
absence,
she
felt
a
satisfaction
which
settled
her
with
her
own
mind,
and
convinced
her,
that
let
Mr.
Knightley
think
or
say
what
he
would,
she
had
done
nothing
which
woman's
friendship
and
woman's
feelings
would
not
justify.
He
had
frightened
her
a
little
about
Mr.

but
when
she
considered
that

as
herself,
that
he
had
spoken
it
hastily
and
in
anger,
she
was
able
to
believe,
that
he
had
rather
said
what
he
wished
resentfully
to
be
true,
than
what
he
knew
any
thing
about.
He
certainly
might
have
heard
Mr.
Elton
speak
with
more
unreserve
than
she
had
ever
done,
and
Mr.
Elton
might
not
be
of
an
imprudent,
inconsiderate
disposition
