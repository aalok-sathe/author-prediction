likely
the
worthy
Coles.
Upon
my
word,
this
is
charming
to
be
standing
about
among
such
friends!
And
such
a
noble
fire!
I
am
quite
roasted.
No
coffee,
I
thank
you,
for
me
never
take
coffee.
A
little
tea
if
you
please,
sir,
by
and
bye,
no
hurry
Oh!
here
it
comes.
Every
thing
so
good!"
Frank
Churchill
returned
to
his
station
by
Emma;
and
as
soon
as
Miss
Bates
was
quiet,
she
found
herself
necessarily
overhearing
the
discourse
of
Mrs.
Elton
and
Miss
Fairfax,
who
were
standing
a
little
way
behind
her.
He
was
thoughtful.
Whether
he
were
overhearing
too,
she
could
not
determine.
After
a
good
many
compliments
to
Jane
on
her
dress
and
look,
compliments
very
quietly
and
properly
taken,
Mrs.
Elton
was
evidently
wanting
to
be
complimented
herself
and
it
was,
"How
do
you
like
my
gown?
How
do
you
like
my
trimming?
How
has
Wright
done
my
hair?"
with
many
other
relative
questions,
all
answered
with
patient
politeness.
Mrs.
Elton
then
said,
"Nobody
can
think
less
of
dress
in
general
than
I
do
but
upon
such
an
occasion
as
this,
when
every
body's
eyes
are
so
much
upon
me,
and
in
compliment
to
the
Westons
