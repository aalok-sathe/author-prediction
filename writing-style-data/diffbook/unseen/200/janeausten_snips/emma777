a
regard
for
Mr.
Knightley,
as
to
think
he
deserved
even
her
dearest
Emma;
and
it
was
in
every
respect
so
proper,
suitable,
and
unexceptionable
a
connexion,
and
in
one
respect,
one
point
of
the
highest
importance,
so
peculiarly
eligible,
so
singularly
fortunate,
that
now
it
seemed
as
if
Emma
could
not
safely
have
attached
herself
to
any
other
creature,
and
that
she
had
herself
been
the
stupidest
of
beings
in
not
having
thought
of
it,
and
wished
it
long
ago.
How
very
few
of
those
men
in
a
rank
of
life
to
address
Emma
would
have
renounced
their
own
home
for
Hartfield!
And
who
but
Mr.
Knightley
could
know
and
bear
with
Mr.
Woodhouse,
so
as
to
make
such
an
arrangement
desirable!
The
difficulty
of
disposing
of
poor
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
been
always
felt
in
her
husband's
plans
and
her
own,
for
a
marriage
between
Frank
and
Emma.
How
to
settle
the
claims
of
Enscombe
and
Hartfield
had
been
a
continual
impediment
less
acknowledged
by
Mr.
Weston
than
by
herself
but
even
he
had
never
been
able
to
finish
the
subject
better
than
by
saying
"Those
matters
will
take
care
of
themselves;
the
young
people
will
find
a
way."
