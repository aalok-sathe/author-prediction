in
the
parish
adjoining,
the
seat
of
Mr.
Knightley,
comprehended
many
such.
Not
unfrequently,
through
Emma's
persuasion,
he
had
some
of
the
chosen
and
the
best
to
dine
with
him:
but
evening
parties
were
what
he
preferred;
and,
unless
he
fancied
himself
at
any
time
unequal
to
company,
there
was
scarcely
an
evening
in
the
week
in
which
Emma
could
not
make
up
a
card
table
for
him.
Real,
long
standing
regard
brought
the
Westons
and
Mr.
Knightley;
and
by
Mr.
Elton,
a
young
man
living
alone
without
liking
it,
the
privilege
of
exchanging
any
vacant
evening
of
his
own
blank
solitude
for
the
elegancies
and
society
of
Mr.
Woodhouse's
drawing
room,
and
the
smiles
of
his
lovely
daughter,
was
in
no
danger
of
being
thrown
away.
After
these
came
a
second
set;
among
the
most
come
at
able
of
whom
were
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates,
and
Mrs.
Goddard,
three
ladies
almost
always
at
the
service
of
an
invitation
from
Hartfield,
and
who
were
fetched
and
carried
home
so
often,
that
Mr.
Woodhouse
thought
it
no
hardship
for
either
James
or
the
horses.
Had
it
taken
place
only
once
a
year,
it
would
have
been
a
grievance.
