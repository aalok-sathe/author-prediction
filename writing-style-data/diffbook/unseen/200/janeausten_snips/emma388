'wait
half
a
minute,
till
I
have
finished
my
job;'
For,
would
you
believe
it,
Miss
Woodhouse,
there
he
is,
in
the
most
obliging
manner
in
the
world,
fastening
in
the
rivet
of
my
mother's
spectacles.
The
rivet
came
out,
you
know,
this
morning.
So
very
obliging!
For
my
mother
had
no
use
of
her
spectacles
could
not
put
them
on.
And,
by
the
bye,
every
body
ought
to
have
two
pair
of
spectacles;
they
should
indeed.
Jane
said
so.
I
meant
to
take
them
over
to
John
Saunders
the
first
thing
I
did,
but
something
or
other
hindered
me
all
the
morning;
first
one
thing,
then
another,
there
is
no
saying
what,
you
know.
At
one
time
Patty
came
to
say
she
thought
the
kitchen
chimney
wanted
sweeping.
Oh,
said
I,
Patty
do
not
come
with
your
bad
news
to
me.
Here
is
the
rivet
of
your
mistress's
spectacles
out.
Then
the
baked
apples
came
home,
Mrs.
Wallis
sent
them
by
her
boy;
they
are
extremely
civil
and
obliging
to
us,
the
Wallises,
always
I
have
heard
some
people
say
that
Mrs.
Wallis
can
be
uncivil
and
give
a
very
rude
answer,
but
we
have
never
known
any
thing
