my
word,
sir,"
cried
Elizabeth,
"your
hope
is
a
rather
extraordinary
one
after
my
declaration.
I
do
assure
you
that
I
am
not
one
of
those
young
ladies
(if
such
young
ladies
there
are)
who
are
so
daring
as
to
risk
their
happiness
on
the
chance
of
being
asked
a
second
time.
I
am
perfectly
serious
in
my
refusal.
You
could
not
make
me
happy,
and
I
am
convinced
that
I
am
the
last
woman
in
the
world
who
could
make
you
so.
Nay,
were
your
friend
Lady
Catherine
to
know
me,
I
am
persuaded
she
would
find
me
in
every
respect
ill
qualified
for
the
situation."
"Were
it
certain
that
Lady
Catherine
would
think
so,"
said
Mr.
Collins
very
gravely
"but
I
cannot
imagine
that
her
ladyship
would
at
all
disapprove
of
you.
And
you
may
be
certain
when
I
have
the
honour
of
seeing
her
again,
I
shall
speak
in
the
very
highest
terms
of
your
modesty,
economy,
and
other
amiable
qualification."
"Indeed,
Mr.
Collins,
all
praise
of
me
will
be
unnecessary.
You
must
give
me
leave
to
judge
for
myself,
and
pay
me
the
compliment
of
believing
what
I
say.
I
wish
you
very
happy
and
very
