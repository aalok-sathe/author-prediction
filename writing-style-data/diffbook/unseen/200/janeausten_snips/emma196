I
do:
but
she
does
not
know
the
parties
so
well
as
I
do.
The
case,
you
see,
is
(but
this
is
quite
between
ourselves:
I
did
not
mention
a
syllable
of
it
in
the
other
room.
There
are
secrets
in
all
families,
you
know)
The
case
is,
that
a
party
of
friends
are
invited
to
pay
a
visit
at
Enscombe
in
January;
and
that
Frank's
coming
depends
upon
their
being
put
off.
If
they
are
not
put
off,
he
cannot
stir.
But
I
know
they
will,
because
it
is
a
family
that
a
certain
lady,
of
some
consequence,
at
Enscombe,
has
a
particular
dislike
to:
and
though
it
is
thought
necessary
to
invite
them
once
in
two
or
three
years,
they
always
are
put
off
when
it
comes
to
the
point.
I
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
of
the
issue.
I
am
as
confident
of
seeing
Frank
here
before
the
middle
of
January,
as
I
am
of
being
here
myself:
but
your
good
friend
there
(nodding
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
table)
has
so
few
vagaries
herself,
and
has
been
so
little
used
to
them
at
Hartfield,
that
she
cannot
calculate
on
their
effects,
as
I
have
been
