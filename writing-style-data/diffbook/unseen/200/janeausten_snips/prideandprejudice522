says.
Happy
shall
I
be,
when
his
stay
at
Netherfield
is
over!"
"I
wish
I
could
say
anything
to
comfort
you,"
replied
Elizabeth;
"but
it
is
wholly
out
of
my
power.
You
must
feel
it;
and
the
usual
satisfaction
of
preaching
patience
to
a
sufferer
is
denied
me,
because
you
have
always
so
much."
Mr.
Bingley
arrived.
Mrs.
Bennet,
through
the
assistance
of
servants,
contrived
to
have
the
earliest
tidings
of
it,
that
the
period
of
anxiety
and
fretfulness
on
her
side

it
could.
She
counted
the
days
that
must
intervene
before

invitation

to
partake
of
her
joy.
Jane
resolutely
kept
her
place
at
the
table;
but
Elizabeth,
to
satisfy
her
mother,
went
to
the
window
she
looked,
she
saw
Mr.
Darcy
with
him,
and
sat
down
again
by
her
sister.
"There
is
a
gentleman
with
him,
mamma,"
said
Kitty;
"who
can
it
be?"
"Some
acquaintance
or
other,
my
dear,
