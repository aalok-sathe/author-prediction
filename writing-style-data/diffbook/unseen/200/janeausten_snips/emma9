in
and
made
it
unnecessary.
Mr.
Knightley,
a
sensible
man
about
seven
or
eight
and
thirty,
was
not
only
a
very
old
and
intimate
friend
of
the
family,
but
particularly
connected
with
it,
as
the
elder
brother
of
Isabella's
husband.
He
lived
about
a
mile
from
Highbury,
was
a
frequent
visitor,
and
always
welcome,
and
at
this
time
more
welcome
than
usual,
as
coming
directly
from
their
mutual
connexions
in
London.
He
had
returned
to
a
late
dinner,
after
some
days'
absence,
and
now

and

many
inquiries
after
"poor
Isabella"
and
her
children
were
answered
most
satisfactorily.
When
this
was
over,
Mr.
Woodhouse
gratefully
observed,
"It
is
very
kind
of
you,
Mr.
Knightley,
to
come
out
at
this
late
hour
to
call
upon
us.
I
am
afraid
you
must
have
had
a
shocking
walk."
"Not
at
all,
sir.
It
is
a
beautiful
moonlight
night;
and
so
mild
that
I
must
draw
back
from
your
great
fire."
"But
you
must
have
found
it
