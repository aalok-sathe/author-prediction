is
very
good
natured,
and
I
shall
always
feel
much
obliged
to
him,
and
have
a
great
regard
for
but
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
and
you
know,
though
he
may
like
me,
it
does
not
follow
that
I
should
and
certainly
I
must
confess
that
since
my
visiting
here
I
have
seen
people
and
if
one
comes
to
compare
them,
person
and
manners,
there
is
no
comparison
at
all,
one
is
so
very
handsome
and
agreeable.
However,
I
do
really
think
Mr.
Martin
a
very
amiable
young
man,
and
have
a
great
opinion
of
him;
and
his
being
so
much
attached
to
me
and
his
writing
such
a
letter
but
as
to
leaving
you,
it
is
what
I
would
not
do
upon
any
consideration."
"Thank
you,
thank
you,
my
own
sweet
little
friend.
We
will
not
be
parted.
A
woman
is
not
to
marry
a
man
merely
because
she
is
asked,
or
because
he
is
attached
to
her,
and
can
write
a
tolerable
letter."
"Oh
no;
and
it
is
but
a
short
letter
too."
Emma
felt
the
bad
taste
of
her
friend,
but
let
it
pass
with
a
"very
true;
and
it
would
be
a
small
consolation
