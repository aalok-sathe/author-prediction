Mr.
Elton?"
"Mr.
Elton
indeed!"
cried
Harriet
indignantly.
"Oh!
no"
and
Emma
could
just
catch
the
words,
"so
superior
to
Mr.
Elton!"
She
then
took
a
longer
time
for
consideration.
Should
she
proceed
no
farther?
should
she
let
it
pass,
and
seem
to
suspect
nothing?
Perhaps
Harriet
might
think
her
cold
or
angry
if
she
did;
or
perhaps
if
she
were
totally
silent,
it
might
only
drive
Harriet
into
asking
her
to
hear
too
much;
and
against
any
thing
like
such
an
unreserve
as
had
been,
such
an
open
and
frequent
discussion
of
hopes
and
chances,
she
was
perfectly
resolved.
She
believed
it
would
be
wiser
for
her
to
say
and
know
at
once,
all
that
she
meant
to
say
and
know.
Plain
dealing
was
always
best.
She
had
previously
determined
how
far
she
would
proceed,
on
any
application
of
the
sort;
and
it
would
be
safer
for
both,
to
have
the
judicious
law
of
her
own
brain
laid
down
with
speed.
She
was
decided,
and
thus
spoke
"Harriet,
I
will
not
affect
to
be
in
doubt
of
your
meaning.
Your
resolution,
or
rather
your
expectation
of
never
marrying,
results
from
an
idea
that
the
person
whom
you
might
prefer,
