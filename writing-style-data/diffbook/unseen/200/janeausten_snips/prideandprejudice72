go
and
at
another
word,
might
stay
a
month."
"You
have
only
proved
by
this,"
cried
Elizabeth,
"that
Mr.
Bingley
did
not
do
justice
to
his
own
disposition.
You
have
shown
him
off
now
much
more
than
he
did
himself."
"I
am
exceedingly
gratified,"
said
Bingley,
"by
your
converting
what
my
friend
says
into
a
compliment
on
the
sweetness
of
my
temper.
But
I
am
afraid
you
are
giving
it
a
turn
which
that
gentleman
did
by
no
means
intend;
for
he
would
certainly
think
better
of
me,
if
under
such
a
circumstance
I
were
to
give
a
flat
denial,
and
ride
off
as
fast
as
I
could."
"Would
Mr.
Darcy
then
consider
the
rashness
of
your
original
intentions
as
atoned
for
by
your
obstinacy
in
adhering
to
it?"
"Upon
my
word,
I
cannot
exactly
explain
the
matter;
Darcy
must
speak
for
himself."
"You
expect
me
to
account
for
opinions
which
you
choose
to
call
mine,
but
which
I
have
never
acknowledged.
Allowing
the
case,
however,
to
stand
according
to
your
representation,
you
must
remember,
Miss
Bennet,
that
the
friend
who
is
supposed
to
desire
his
return
to
the
house,
and
the
delay
of
his
plan,
has
merely
desired
it,
