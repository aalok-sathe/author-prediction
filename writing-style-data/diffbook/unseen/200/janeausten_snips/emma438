Mr.
Elton's
concerns
were
assuming
the
most
irresistible
form.
His
wedding
day
was
named.
He
would
soon
be
among
them
again;
Mr.
Elton
and
his
bride.
There
was
hardly
time
to
talk
over
the
first
letter
from
Enscombe
before
"Mr.
Elton
and
his
bride"
was
in
every
body's
mouth,
and
Frank
Churchill
was
forgotten.
Emma
grew
sick
at
the
sound.
She
had
had
three
weeks
of
happy
exemption
from
Mr.
Elton;
and
Harriet's
mind,
she
had
been
willing
to
hope,
had
been
lately
gaining
strength.
With
Mr.
Weston's
ball
in
view
at
least,
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
insensibility
to
other
things;
but
it
was
now
too
evident
that
she
had
not
attained
such
a
state
of
composure
as
could
stand
against
the
actual
approach
new
carriage,
bell
ringing,
and
all.
Poor
Harriet
was
in
a
flutter
of
spirits
which
required
all
the
reasonings
and
soothings
and
attentions
of
every
kind
that
Emma
could
give.
Emma
felt
that
she
could
not
do
too
much
for
her,
that
Harriet
had
a
right
to
all
her
ingenuity
and
all
her
patience;
but
it
was
heavy
work
to
be
for
ever
convincing
without
producing
any
effect,
for
ever
agreed
to,
without
