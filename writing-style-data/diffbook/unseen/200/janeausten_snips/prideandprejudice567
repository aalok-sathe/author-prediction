Elizabeth
was
spared
from
much
teasing
on
the
subject.
The
next
morning,
as
she
was
going
downstairs,
she
was
met
by
her
father,
who
came
out
of
his
library
with
a
letter
in
his
hand.
"Lizzy,"
said
he,
"I
was
going
to
look
for
you;
come
into
my
room."
She
followed
him
thither;
and
her
curiosity
to
know
what
he
had
to
tell
her
was
heightened
by
the
supposition
of
its
being
in
some
manner
connected
with
the
letter
he
held.
It
suddenly
struck
her
that
it
might
be
from
Lady
Catherine;
and
she
anticipated
with
dismay
all
the
consequent
explanations.
She
followed
her
father
to
the
fire
place,
and
they
both
sat
down.
He
then
said,
"I
have
received
a
letter
this
morning
that
has
astonished
me
exceedingly.
As
it
principally
concerns
yourself,
you
ought
to
know
its
contents.
I
did
not
know
before,
that
I
had
two
daughters
on
the
brink
of
matrimony.
Let
me
congratulate
you
on
a
very
important
conquest."
The
colour
now
rushed
into
Elizabeth's
cheeks
in
the
instantaneous
conviction
of
its
being
a
letter
from
the
nephew,
instead
of
the
aunt;
and
she
was
undetermined
whether
most
to
be
pleased
that
he
explained
himself
