people,
who
deserved
to
be
made
happy!
And
left
a
name
behind
her
that
would
not
soon
die
away.
Perfect
happiness,
even
in
memory,
is
not
common;
and
there
were
two
points
on
which
she
was
not
quite
easy.
She
doubted
whether
she
had
not
transgressed
the
duty
of
woman
by
woman,
in
betraying
her
suspicions
of
Jane
Fairfax's
feelings
to
Frank
Churchill.
It
was
hardly
right;
but
it
had
been
so
strong
an
idea,
that
it
would
escape
her,
and
his
submission
to
all
that
she
told,
was
a
compliment
to
her
penetration,
which
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
be
quite

that
she
ought
to
have
held
her
tongue.
The
other
circumstance
of
regret
related
also
to
Jane

and
there
she
had
no
doubt.
She
did
unfeignedly
and
unequivocally
regret
the
inferiority
of
her
own
playing
and
singing.
She
did
most
heartily
grieve
over
the
idleness
of
her
childhood
and
sat
down
and
practised
vigorously
an
hour
and
a
half.
She
was
then
interrupted
by
Harriet's
coming
in;
and
if
Harriet's
praise
could
have
satisfied
her,
she
might
soon
have
been
comforted.
"Oh!
if
I
could
but
play
as
well
as
you
and
Miss
Fairfax!"
"Don't
