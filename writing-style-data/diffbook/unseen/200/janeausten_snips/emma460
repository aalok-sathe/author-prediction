say
your
apologies
were
accepted,
sir.
Mr.
Elton
knows
you."
"Yes:
but
a
young
lady
a
bride
I
ought
to
have
paid
my
respects
to
her
if
possible.
It
was
being
very
deficient."
"But,
my
dear
papa,
you
are
no
friend
to
matrimony;
and
therefore
why
should
you

so

to
pay
your

who
they
may."
"Well,
papa,
if
this
is
not
encouragement
to
marry,
I
do
not
know
what
is.
And
I
should
never
have
expected
you
to
be
lending
your
sanction
to
such
vanity
baits
for
poor
young
ladies."
"My
dear,
you
do
not
understand
me.
This
is
a
matter
of
mere
common
politeness
and
good
breeding,
and
has
nothing

with
any
