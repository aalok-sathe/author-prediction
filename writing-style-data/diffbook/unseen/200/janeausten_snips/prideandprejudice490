receive
her
and
her
husband
at
Longbourn,
as
soon
as
they
were
married,
that
he
was
prevailed
on
to
think
as
they
thought,
and
act
as
they
wished.
And
their
mother
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
would
be
able
to
show
her
married
daughter
in

neighbourhood
before
she

and
Jane
and

felt
for

more
than
she
felt

The
carriage
was
sent
to
meet
them
at
,
and
they
were
to
return
in
it
by
dinner
time.
Their
arrival
was
dreaded
by
the
elder
Miss
Bennets,
and
Jane
more
especially,
who
gave
Lydia
the
feelings
which
would

had
she

culprit,
and
was
wretched
in
the
thought
of

sister
