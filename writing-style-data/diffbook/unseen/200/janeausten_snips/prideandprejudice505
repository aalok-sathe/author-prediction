as
to
his
future
situation,
he
could
conjecture
very
little
about
it.
He
must
go
somewhere,
but
he
did
not
know
where,
and
he
knew
he
should
have
nothing
to
live
on.
"Mr.
Darcy
asked
him
why
he
had
not
married
your
sister
at
once.
Though
Mr.
Bennet
was
not
imagined
to
be
very
rich,
he
would
have
been
able
to
do
something
for
him,
and
his
situation
must
have
been
benefited
by
marriage.
But
he
found,
in
reply
to
this

that
Wickham
still
cherished
the
hope
of
more
effectually
making
his
fortune
by
marriage
in
some
other
country.
Under
such
circumstances,
however,
he
was
not
likely
to
be
proof
against
the
temptation
of
immediate

for
there
was

wanted
more

he
could
get;
but
at
length
was
reduced
to
be
reasonable.
"Every
thing
being
settled
between
them,
Mr.
Darcy's
next
step
was
to
make
your
uncle
acquainted
with
it,
and
he
first
called
in
Gracechurch
street
the
evening
before
I
came
home.
But
Mr.
Gardiner
could
not
be
seen,
and
Mr.
Darcy
found,
on
further
inquiry,
that
your
father
was
still
with
him,
but
would
quit
