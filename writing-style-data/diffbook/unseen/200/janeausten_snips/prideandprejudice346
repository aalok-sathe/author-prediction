so
all
the
way,
if
Kitty
had
not
been
sick;
and
when
we
got
to
the
George,
I
do
think
we
behaved
very
handsomely,
for
we
treated
the
other
three
with
the
nicest
cold
luncheon
in
the
world,
and
if
you
would
have
gone,
we
would
have
treated
you
too.
And
then
when
we
came
away
it
was
such
fun!
I
thought
we
never
should
have
got
into
the
coach.
I
was
ready
to

might
have
heard

To
this
Mary
very
gravely
replied,
"Far

the
generality
of
female

But
I
confess
they
would
have
no
charms
for
me
I
should
infinitely
prefer
a
book."
But
of
this
answer
Lydia
heard
not
a
word.
She
seldom
listened
to
anybody
for
more
than
half
a
minute,
and
never
attended
to
Mary
at
all.
In
the
afternoon
Lydia
was
urgent
with
the
rest
of
the
girls
to
walk
to
Meryton,
and
to
see
how
everybody
went
on;
