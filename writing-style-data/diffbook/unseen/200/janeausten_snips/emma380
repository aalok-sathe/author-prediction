class
us
together,
Harriet.
My
playing
is
no
more
like
her's,
than
a
lamp
is
like
sunshine."
"Oh!
dear
I
think
you
play
the
best
of
the
two.
I
think
you
play
quite
as
well
as
she
does.
I
am
sure
I
had
much
rather
hear
you.
Every
body
last
night
said
how
well
you
played."
"Those
who
knew
any
thing
about
it,
must
have
felt
the
difference.
The
truth
is,
Harriet,
that
my
playing
is
just
good
enough
to
be
praised,
but
Jane
Fairfax's
is
much
beyond
it."
"Well,
I
always
shall
think
that
you
play
quite
as
well
as
she
does,
or
that
if
there
is
any
difference
nobody
would
ever
find
it
out.
Mr.
Cole
said
how
much
taste
you
had;
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
talked
a
great
deal
about
your
taste,
and
that
he
valued
taste
much
more
than
execution."
"Ah!
but
Jane
Fairfax
has
them
both,
Harriet."
"Are
you
sure?
I
saw
she
had
execution,
but
I
did
not
know
she
had
any
taste.
Nobody
talked
about
it.
And
I
hate
Italian
singing.
There
is
no
understanding
a
word
of
it.
Besides,
if
she
does
play
so
very
well,
you
know,
it
is
no
more
