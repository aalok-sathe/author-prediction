"but
it
does
not
follow
that
the
interruption
must
be
unwelcome."
"I
should
be
sorry
indeed,
if
it
were.
We
were
always
good
friends;
and
now
we
are
better."
"True.
Are
the
others
coming
out?"
"I
do
not
know.
Mrs.
Bennet
and
Lydia
are
going

she
say?"
"That
you
were
gone
into
the
army,
and
she
was

well.
At
such
