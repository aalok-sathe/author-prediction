His
circumstances,
he
assured
me,
and
I
had
no
difficulty
in
believing
it,
were
exceedingly
bad.
He
had
found
the
law
a
most
unprofitable
study,
and
was
now
absolutely
resolved
on
being
ordained,
if
I
would
present
him
to
the
living
in
question
of
which
he
trusted
there
could
be
little
doubt,
as
he
was
well
assured
that

You

was
dropped.
How

lived
I
know
not.
But
last
summer
he
was
again
most
painfully
obtruded
on
my
notice.
"I
must
now
mention
a
circumstance
which
I
would
wish
to
forget
myself,
and
which
no
obligation
less
than
the
present
should
induce
me
to
unfold
to
any
human
being.
Having
said
thus

no
doubt
of
your
secrecy.
