her
husband,
who
was
fond
of
society,
a
perfect
willingness
to
accept
it,
she
ventured
to
engage
for
her
attendance,
and
the
day
after
the
next
was
fixed
on.
Bingley
expressed
great
pleasure
in
the
certainty
of
seeing
Elizabeth
again,
having
still
a
great
deal
to
say
to
her,
and
many
inquiries
to
make
after
all
their
Hertfordshire
friends.
Elizabeth,
construing
all
this
into
a
wish
of
hearing
her
speak
of
her
sister,
was
pleased,
and
on
this
account,
as
well
as
some
others,
found
herself,
when
their
visitors
left
them,
capable
of
considering
the
last
half
hour
with
some
satisfaction,
though
while
it
was
passing,
the
enjoyment
of
it
had
been
little.
Eager
to
be
alone,
and
fearful
of
inquiries
or
hints
from
her
uncle
and
aunt,
she
stayed
with
them
only
long
enough
to
hear
their
favourable
opinion
of
Bingley,
and
then
hurried
away
to
dress.
But
she
had
no
reason
to
fear
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner's
curiosity;
it
was
not
their
wish
to
force
her
communication.
It
was
evident
that
she
was
much
better
acquainted
with
Mr.
Darcy
than
they
had
before
any
idea
of;
it
was
evident
that
he
was
very
much
in
love
with
her.
