receive
the
completest
proof
of
it.
I
thought
it
must
be
so.
I
thought
I
could
not
be
so
deceived;
but
now,
it
is
clear;
the
state
of
his
mind
is
as
clear
and
decided,
as
my
wishes
on
the
subject
have
been
ever
since
I
knew
you.
Yes,
Harriet,
just
so
long
have
I
been
wanting
the
very
circumstance
to
happen
that
has
happened.
I
could
never
tell
whether
an
attachment
between
you
and
Mr.
Elton
were
most
desirable
or
most
natural.
Its
probability
and
its
eligibility
have
really
so
equalled
each
other!
I
am
very
happy.
I
congratulate
you,
my
dear
Harriet,
with
all
my
heart.
This
is
an
attachment
which
a
woman
may
well
feel
pride
in
creating.
This
is
a
connexion
which
offers
nothing
but
good.
It
will
give
you
every
thing
that
you
want
consideration,
independence,
a
proper
home
it
will
fix
you
in
the
centre
of
all
your
real
friends,
close
to
Hartfield
and
to
me,
and
confirm
our
intimacy
for
ever.
This,
Harriet,
is
an
alliance
which
can
never
raise
a
blush
in
either
of
us."
"Dear
Miss
Woodhouse!"
and
"Dear
Miss
Woodhouse,"
was
all
that
Harriet,
with
many
tender
embraces
could
articulate
