and
his
companions
had
not
expected
to
be
detained
by
any
interest
excited
there;
but
in
passing
it
they
gave
the
history
of
the
large
room
visibly
added;
it
had
been
built
many
years
ago
for
a
ball
room,
and
while
the
neighbourhood
had
been
in
a
particularly
populous,
dancing
state,
had
been
occasionally
used
as
such;
but
such
brilliant
days
had
long
passed
away,
and
now
the
highest
purpose
for
which
it
was
ever
wanted
was
to
accommodate
a
whist
club
established
among
the
gentlemen
and
half
gentlemen
of
the
place.
He
was
immediately
interested.
Its
character
as
a
ball
room
caught
him;
and
instead
of
passing
on,
he
stopt
for
several
minutes
at
the
two
superior
sashed
windows
which
were
open,
to
look
in
and
contemplate
its
capabilities,
and
lament
that
its
original
purpose
should
have
ceased.
He
saw
no
fault
in
the
room,
he
would
acknowledge
none
which
they
suggested.
No,
it
was
long
enough,
broad
enough,
handsome
enough.
It
would
hold
the
very
number
for
comfort.
They
ought
to
have
balls
there
at
least
every
fortnight
through
the
winter.
Why
had
not
Miss
Woodhouse
revived
the
former
good
old
days
of
the
room?
She
