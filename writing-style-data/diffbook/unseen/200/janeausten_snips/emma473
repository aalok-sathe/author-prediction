Knightley.
I
will
say
that
for
you."
He
seemed
hardly
to
hear
her;
he
was
thoughtful
and
in
a
manner
which
shewed
him
not
pleased,
soon
afterwards
said,
"So
you
have
been
settling
that
I
should
marry
Jane
Fairfax?"
"No
indeed
I
have
not.
You
have
scolded
me
too
much
for
match
making,
for
me
to
presume
to
take
such
a
liberty
with
you.
What
I
said
just
now,
meant
nothing.
One
says
those
sort
of
things,
of
course,
without
any
idea
of
a
serious
meaning.
Oh!
no,
upon
my
word
I
have
not
the
smallest
wish
for
your
marrying
Jane
Fairfax
or
Jane
any
body.
You
would
not
come
in
and
sit
with
us
in
this
comfortable
way,
if
you
were
married."
Mr.
Knightley
was
thoughtful
again.
The
result
of
his
reverie
was,
"No,
Emma,
I
do
not
think
the
extent
of
my
admiration
for
her
will
ever
take
me
by
surprize.
I
never
had
a
thought
of
her
in
that
way,
I
assure
you."
And
soon
afterwards,
"Jane
Fairfax
is
a
very
charming
young
woman
but
not
even
Jane
Fairfax
is
perfect.
She
has
a
fault.
She
has
not
the
open
temper
which
a
man
would
wish
for
