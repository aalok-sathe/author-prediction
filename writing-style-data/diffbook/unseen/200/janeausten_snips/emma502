happy.
Her
congratulations
were
warm
and
open;
but
Emma
could
not
speak
so
fluently.
She
was
a
little
occupied
in
weighing
her
own
feelings,
and
trying
to
understand
the
degree
of
her
agitation,
which
she
rather
thought
was
considerable.
Mr.
Weston,
however,
too
eager
to
be
very
observant,
too
communicative
to
want
others
to
talk,
was
very
well
satisfied
with
what
she
did
say,
and
soon
moved
away
to
make
the
rest
of
his

he
would
have
proceeded
to
Miss
Fairfax,
but
she
was
so
deep
in
conversation
with
John
Knightley,
that
it
would
have
been
too
positive
an
interruption;
and
finding
himself
close
to
Mrs.
Elton,
and
her
attention
disengaged,
he
necessarily
began
on
the
subject
with
her.
"I
hope
I
shall
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
my
son
to
you,"
said
Mr.
Weston.
Mrs.
Elton,
very
willing
