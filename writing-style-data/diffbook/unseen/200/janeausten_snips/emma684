much
feared,
on
Mr.
Knightley.
Were
this
most
unequal
of
all
connexions
to
take
place,
on
her
must
rest
all
the
reproach
of
having
given
it
a
beginning;
for
his
attachment,
she
must
believe
to
be
produced
only
by
a
consciousness
of
Harriet's;
and
even
were
this
not
the
case,
he
would
never
have
known
Harriet
at
all
but
for
her
folly.
Mr.
Knightley
and
Harriet
Smith!
It
was
a
union
to
distance
every
wonder
of
the
kind.
The
attachment
of
Frank
Churchill
and
Jane
Fairfax
became
commonplace,
threadbare,
stale
in
the
comparison,
exciting
no
surprize,
presenting
no
disparity,
affording
nothing
to
be
said
or
thought.
Mr.
Knightley
and
Harriet
Smith!
Such
an
elevation
on
her
side!
Such
a
debasement
on
his!
It
was
horrible
to
Emma
to
think
how
it
must
sink
him
in
the
general
opinion,
to
foresee
the
smiles,
the
sneers,
the
merriment
it
would
prompt
at
his
expense;
the
mortification
and
disdain
of
his
brother,
the
thousand
inconveniences
to
himself.
Could
it
be?
No;
it
was
impossible.
And
yet
it
was
far,
very
far,
from
impossible.
Was
it
a
new
circumstance
for
a
man
of
first
rate
abilities
to
be
captivated
by
very
inferior
powers?
