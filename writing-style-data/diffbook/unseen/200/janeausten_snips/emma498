do
you
like
it?
Selina's
choice
handsome,
I
think,
but
I
do
not
know
whether
it
is
not
over
trimmed;
I
have
the
greatest
dislike
to
the
idea
of
being
over
trimmed
quite
a
horror
of
finery.
I
must
put
on
a
few
ornaments
now,
because
it
is
expected
of
me.
A
bride,
you
know,
must
appear
like
a
bride,
but
my
natural
taste
is
all
for
simplicity;
a
simple
style
of
dress
is
so
infinitely
preferable
to
finery.
But
I
am
quite
in
the
minority,
I
believe;
few
people
seem
to
value
simplicity
of
dress,
show
and
finery
are
every
thing.
I
have
some
notion
of
putting
such
a
trimming
as
this
to
my
white
and
silver
poplin.
Do
you
think
it
will
look
well?"
The
whole
party
were
but
just
reassembled
in
the
drawing
room
when
Mr.
Weston
made
his
appearance
among
them.
He
had
returned
to
a
late
dinner,
and
walked
to
Hartfield
as
soon
as
it
was
over.
He
had
been
too
much
expected
by
the
best
judges,
for
surprize
but
there
was
great
joy.
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
almost
as
glad
to
see
him
now,
as
he
would
have
been
sorry
to
see
him
before.
