the
rest
of
the
party
with
whom
he
had
been
travelling.
"They
will
join
me
early
to
morrow,"
he
continued,
"and
among
them
are
some
who
will
claim
an
acquaintance
with
you
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
sisters."
Elizabeth
answered
only
by
a
slight
bow.
Her
thoughts
were
instantly
driven
back
to
the
time
when
Mr.
Bingley's
name
had
been
the
last
mentioned
between
them;
and,
if
she
might
judge
by
his
complexion,
his
mind
was
not
very
differently
engaged.
"There
is
also
one
other
person
in
the
party,"
he
continued
after
a
pause,
"who
more
particularly
wishes
to
be
known
to
you.
Will
you
allow
me,
or
do
I
ask
too
much,
to
introduce
my
sister
to
your
acquaintance
during
your
stay
at
Lambton?"
The
surprise
of
such
an
application
was
great
indeed;
it
was
too
great
for
her
to
know
in
what
manner
she
acceded
to
it.
She
immediately
felt
that
whatever
desire
Miss
Darcy
might
have
of
being
acquainted
with
her
must
be
the
work
of
her
brother,
and,
without
looking
farther,
it
was
satisfactory;
it
was
gratifying
to
know
that
his
resentment
had
not
made
him
think
really
ill
of
her.
They
now
walked
on
in
silence,
