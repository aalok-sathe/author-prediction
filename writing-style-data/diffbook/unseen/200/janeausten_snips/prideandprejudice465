wish
to
be
at
home,
it
was
settled
that
she
and
the
children
should
go
to
London,
at
the
same
time
that
Mr.
Bennet
came
from
it.
The
coach,
therefore,
took
them
the
first
stage
of
their
journey,
and
brought
its
master
back
to
Longbourn.
Mrs.
Gardiner
went
away
in
all
the
perplexity
about
Elizabeth
and
her
Derbyshire
friend
that
had
attended
her
from
that
part
of
the
world.
His
name
had
never
been
voluntarily
mentioned
before
them
by
her
niece;
and
the
kind
of
half
expectation
which
Mrs.
Gardiner
had
formed,
of
their
being
followed
by
a
letter
from
him,
had
ended
in
nothing.
Elizabeth
had
received
none
since
her
return
that
could
come
from
Pemberley.
The
present
unhappy
state
of
the
family
rendered
any
other
excuse
for
the
lowness
of
her
spirits
unnecessary;
nothing,
therefore,
could
be
fairly
conjectured
from
that,
though
Elizabeth,
who
was
by
this
time
tolerably
well
acquainted
with
her
own
feelings,
was
perfectly
aware
that,
had
she
known
nothing
of
Darcy,
she
could
have
borne
the
dread
of
Lydia's
infamy
somewhat
better.
It
would
have
spared
her,
she
thought,
one
sleepless
night
out
of
two.
When
Mr.
Bennet
arrived,
he
had
all
the
