Longbourn
there
would
be
leisure
enough
for
observation.
It
was
not
without
an
effort,
meanwhile,
that
she
could
wait
even
for
Longbourn,
before
she
told
her
sister
of
Mr.
Darcy's
proposals.
To
know
that
she
had
the
power
of
revealing
what
would
so
exceedingly
astonish
Jane,
and
must,
at
the
same
time,
so
highly
gratify
whatever
of
her
own
vanity
she
had
not
yet
been
able
to
reason
away,
was
such
a
temptation
to
openness
as
nothing
could
have
conquered
but
the
state
of
indecision
in
which
she
remained
as
to
the
extent
of
what
she
should
communicate;
and
her
fear,
if
she
once
entered
on
the
subject,
of
being
hurried
into
repeating
something
of
Bingley
which
might
only
grieve
her
sister
further.
It
was
the
second
week
in
May,
in
which
the
three
young
ladies
set
out
together
from
Gracechurch
Street
for
the
town
of
,
in
Hertfordshire;
and,
as
they
drew
near
the
appointed
inn
where
Mr.
Bennet's
carriage
was
to
meet
them,
they
quickly
perceived,
in
token
of
the
coachman's
punctuality,
both
Kitty
and
Lydia
looking
out
of
a
dining
room
up
stairs.
These
two
girls
had
been
above
an
hour
in
the
place,
happily
employed
in
