saying
to
myself,
'Even
Emma,
with
all
her
partiality
for
Harriet,
will
think
this
a
good
match.'"
"I
cannot
help
wondering
at
your
knowing
so
little
of
Emma
as
to
say
any
such
thing.
What!
think
a
farmer,
(and
with
all
his
sense
and
all
his
merit
Mr.
Martin
is
nothing
more,)
a
good
match
for
my
intimate
friend!
Not
regret
her
leaving
Highbury
for
the

marrying
a
man
whom
I

I

may
be
the
richest
of
the
two,
but
he
is
undoubtedly
her
inferior
as
to
rank
in
society.
The
sphere
in
which
she
moves
is
much
above
his.
It
would
be
a
degradation."
"A
degradation
to
illegitimacy
and
ignorance,
to
be
married
to
a
respectable,
intelligent
gentleman
farmer!"
"As
to
the
circumstances
of
her
birth,
though
in
a
legal
sense
she
may
be
called
Nobody,
