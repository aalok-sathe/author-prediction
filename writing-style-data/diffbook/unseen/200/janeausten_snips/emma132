word
now
and
then;
but
he
is
an
affectionate
father
certainly
Mr.
John
Knightley
is
an
affectionate
father.
The
children
are
all
fond
of
him."
"And
then
their
uncle
comes
in,
and
tosses
them
up
to
the
ceiling
in
a
very
frightful
way!"
"But
they
like
it,
papa;
there
is
nothing

is
such
enjoyment
to
them,
that
if
their
uncle
did

lay
down
the
rule
of
their
taking
turns,
whichever
began
would
never
give

"Well,
I
cannot
understand
it."
"That
is
the

papa.

the

cannot
understand
the
pleasures
of

hero
of
this
inimitable
charade
walked
in
again.
Harriet
turned
away;
but
Emma
could
receive
him
with
the
usual
smile,
and
her
quick
eye
soon
discerned
in
his
the
consciousness
of
having
made
a
push
of
having
thrown
a
die;
and
she
imagined
he
was
come
to
see
how
it
might
turn
up.
His
ostensible
reason,
however,
was
to
ask
whether
Mr.
Woodhouse's
party
could
be
made
up
in
