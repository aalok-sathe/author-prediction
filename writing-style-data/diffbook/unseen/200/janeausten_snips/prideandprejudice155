to
be
obliged
to
say
nothing
he
may
not
like

"For
heaven's
sake,
madam,
speak
lower.
What
advantage
can
it
be
for
you
to
offend
Mr.
Darcy?
You
will
never
recommend
yourself
to
his
friend
by
so

Nothing
that
she
could
say,

Her
mother
would
talk

and
Lady

of
delights
which
she
saw
no
likelihood
of
sharing,
was
left
to
the
comforts
of
cold
ham
and
chicken.
Elizabeth
now
began
to
revive.
But
not
long
was
the
interval
of
