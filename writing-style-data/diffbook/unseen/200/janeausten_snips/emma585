"
Mrs.
Weston,
I
suppose,"
interrupted
Mrs.
Elton,
rather
mortified.
"No
Mrs.
Knightley;
and
till
she
is
in
being,
I
will
manage
such
matters
myself."
"Ah!
you
are
an
odd
creature!"
she
cried,
satisfied
to
have
no
one
preferred
to
herself.
"You
are
a
humourist,
and
may
say
what
you
like.
Quite
a
humourist.
Well,
I
shall
bring
Jane
with
me
Jane
and
her
aunt.
The
rest
I
leave
to
you.
I
have
no
objections
at
all
to
meeting
the
Hartfield
family.
Don't
scruple.
I
know
you
are
attached
to
them."
"You
certainly
will
meet
them
if
I
can
prevail;
and
I
shall
call
on
Miss
Bates
in
my
way
home."
"That's
quite
unnecessary;
I
see
Jane
every
day:
but
as
you
like.
It
is
to
be
a
morning
scheme,
you
know,
Knightley;
quite
a
simple
thing.
I
shall
wear
a
large
bonnet,
and
bring
one
of
my
little
baskets
hanging
on
my
arm.
Here,
probably
this
basket
with
pink
ribbon.
Nothing
can
be
more
simple,
you
see.
And
Jane
will
have
such
another.
There

of
gipsy
