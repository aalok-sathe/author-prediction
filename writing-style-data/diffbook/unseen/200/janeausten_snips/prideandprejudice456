as
this,
one
cannot
see
too
little
of
one's
neighbours.
Assistance
is
impossible;
condolence
insufferable.
Let
them
triumph
over
us
at
a
distance,
and
be
satisfied."
She
then
proceeded
to
inquire
into
the
measures
which
her
father
had
intended
to
pursue,
while
in
town,
for
the
recovery
of
his
daughter.
"He
meant
I
believe,"
replied
Jane,
"to
go
to
Epsom,
the
place
where
they
last
changed
horses,
see
the
postilions
and
try
if
anything
could
be
made
out
from
them.
His
principal
object
must
be
to
discover
the
number
of
the
hackney
coach
which
took
them
from
Clapham.
It
had
come
with
a
fare
from
London;
and
as
he
thought
that
the
circumstance
of
a
gentleman
and
lady's
removing
from
one
carriage
into
another
might
be
remarked
he
meant
to
make
inquiries
at
Clapham.
If
he
could
anyhow
discover
at
what
house
the
coachman
had
before
set
down
his
fare,
he
determined
to
make
inquiries
there,
and
hoped
it
might
not
be
impossible
to
find
out
the
stand
and
number
of
the
coach.
I
do
not
know
of
any
other
designs
that
he
had
formed;
but
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
be
gone,
and
his
spirits
so
greatly
