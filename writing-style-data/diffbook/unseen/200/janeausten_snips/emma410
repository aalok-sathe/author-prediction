one
is
unwilling
to
give
the
matter
up.
It
would
be
a
disappointment
to
my
father
and
altogether
I
do
not
know
that
I
am
rather
of
opinion
that
ten
couple
might
stand
here
very
well."
Emma
perceived
that
the
nature
of
his
gallantry
was
a
little
self
willed,
and
that
he
would
rather
oppose
than
lose
the
pleasure
of
dancing
with
her;
but
she
took
the
compliment,
and
forgave
the
rest.
Had
she
intended
ever
to
marry
him,
it
might
have
been
worth
while
to
pause
and
consider,
and
try
to
understand
the
value
of
his
preference,
and
the
character
of
his
temper;
but
for
all
the
purposes
of
their
acquaintance,
he
was
quite
amiable
enough.
Before
the
middle
of
the
next
day,
he
was
at
Hartfield;
and
he
entered
the
room
with
such
an
agreeable
smile
as
certified
the
continuance
of
the
scheme.
It
soon
appeared
that
he
came
to
announce
an
improvement.
"Well,
Miss
Woodhouse,"
he
almost
immediately
began,
"your
inclination
for
dancing
has
not
been
quite
frightened
away,
I
hope,
by
the
terrors
of
my
father's
little
rooms.
I
bring
a
new
proposal
on
the
subject:
a
thought
of
my
father's,
which
waits
only
your
approbation
