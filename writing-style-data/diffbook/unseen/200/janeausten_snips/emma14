if

not
like
it.
Oh
no!
Mr.
Weston
certainly
would
never
marry
again.
Some
people
even
talked
of
a
promise
to
his
wife
on
her
deathbed,
and
others
of
the
son
and
the
uncle
not
letting
him.
All
manner
of
solemn
nonsense
was
talked
on
the
subject,
but
I
believed
none
of
it.
"Ever
since
the
day
about
four
years
ago

Miss
Taylor
and
I
met
with

in
Broadway

it
began
to

gallantry,
and

two
umbrellas

Farmer
Mitchell's,

success
has

this
instance,
dear
papa,
you
cannot
think
that
I
shall
leave
off
match
making."
"I
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
by
'success,'"
said
Mr.
Knightley.
"Success
supposes
endeavour.
Your
time
has
been
properly
and
delicately
spent,
if
you
have
been
endeavouring
for
the
last
four
years
to
bring
about
this
marriage.
A
worthy
employment
for
a
young
lady's
mind!
But
if,
which
I
rather
imagine,

making
the
match,
