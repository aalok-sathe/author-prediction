Mrs.
Elton
had
most
kindly
sent
Jane
a
note,
or
we
should
have
been.
But
two
such
offers
in
one
day!
Never
were
such
neighbours.
I
said
to
my
mother,
'Upon
my
word,
ma'am
.'
Thank
you,
my
mother
is
remarkably
well.
Gone
to
Mr.
Woodhouse's.
I
made
her
take
her
shawl
for
the
evenings
are
not
warm
her
large
new
shawl
Mrs.
Dixon's
wedding
present.
So
kind
of
her
to
think
of
my
mother!
Bought
at
Weymouth,
you
know
Mr.
Dixon's
choice.
There
were
three
others,
Jane
says,
which
they
hesitated
about
some
time.
Colonel
Campbell
rather
preferred
an
olive.
My
dear
Jane,
are
you
sure
you
did
not
wet
your
feet?
It
was
but
a
drop
or
two,
but
I
am
so
afraid:
but
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
was
so
extremely
and
there
was
a
mat
to
step
upon
I
shall
never
forget
his
extreme
politeness.
Oh!
Mr.
Frank
Churchill,
I
must
tell
you
my
mother's
spectacles
have
never
been
in
fault
since;
the
rivet
never
came
out
again.
My
mother
often
talks
of
your
good
nature.
Does
not
she,
Jane?
Do
not
we
often
talk
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill?
Ah!
here's
Miss
Woodhouse.
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
how
do
