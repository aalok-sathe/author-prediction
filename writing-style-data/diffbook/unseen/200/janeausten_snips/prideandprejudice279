the
case
here.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Collins
have
a
comfortable
income,
but
not
such
a
one
as
will
allow
of
frequent
journeys
and
I
am
persuaded
my
friend
would
not
call
herself
near
her
family
under
less
than
half
the

distance."
Mr.
Darcy
drew
his
chair
a

just
returned
from
her
walk.
The
tete

surprised
them.
Mr.
Darcy
related
the
mistake
which
had
occasioned
his
intruding
on
Miss
Bennet,
and
after
sitting
a
few
minutes
longer
without
saying
much
to
anybody,
went
away.
"What
can
be
the
meaning
of
this?"
said
Charlotte,
as
soon
as
he
was
gone.
"My
dear,
Eliza,
he
must
be
in
love
with
you,
