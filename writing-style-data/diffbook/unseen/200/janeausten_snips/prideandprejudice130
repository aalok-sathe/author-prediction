passed
between
Mr.
Wickham
and
herself.
Jane
listened
with
astonishment
and
concern;
she
knew
not
how
to
believe
that
Mr.
Darcy
could
be
so
unworthy
of
Mr.
Bingley's
regard;
and
yet,
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
question
the
veracity
of
a
young
man
of
such
amiable
appearance
as
Wickham.
The
possibility
of
his
having
endured
such
unkindness,
was
enough
to
interest
all
her
tender
feelings;
and
nothing
remained
therefore
to
be
done,
but
to
think
well
of
them
both,
to
defend
the
conduct
of
each,
and
throw
into
the
account
of
accident
or
mistake
whatever
could
not
be
otherwise
explained.
"They
have
both,"
said
she,
"been
deceived,
I
dare
say,
in
some
way
or
other,
of
which
we
can
form
no
idea.
Interested
people
have
perhaps
misrepresented
each
to
the
other.
It
is,
in
short,
impossible
for
us
to
conjecture
the
causes
or
circumstances
which
may
have
alienated
them,
without
actual
blame
on
either
side."
"Very
true,
indeed;
and
now,
my
dear
Jane,
what
have
you
got
to
say
on
behalf
of
the
interested
people
who
have
probably
been
concerned
in
the
business?
Do
clear
them
too,
or
we
shall
be
obliged
to
think
ill
of
somebody."
