so
admired,
nothing
could
be
like
it.
Everybody
said
how
well
she
looked;
and
Mr.
Bingley
thought
her
quite
beautiful,
and
danced
with
her
twice!
Only
think
of
that,
my
dear;
he
actually
danced
with
her
twice!
and
she
was
the
only
creature
in
the
room

he
asked
a

Lizzy,
and

"If
he
had

compassion
for
me,"
cried
her
husband
impatiently,
"he
would
not
have
danced
half
so

For
God's

his
partners.
Oh

he
had
sprained
his

in
the
first
dance!"
