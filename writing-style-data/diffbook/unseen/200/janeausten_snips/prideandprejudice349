a
stroke
was
this
for
poor
Jane!
who
would
willingly
have
gone
through
the
world
without
believing
that
so
much
wickedness
existed
in
the
whole
race
of
mankind,
as
was
here
collected
in
one
individual.
Nor
was
Darcy's
vindication,
though
grateful
to
her
feelings,
capable
of
consoling
her
for
such
discovery.
Most
earnestly
did
she
labour
to
prove
the
probability
of
error,
and
seek
to

involving
the

"This
will
not
do,"
said
Elizabeth;
"you
never
will
be
able
to
make
both
of
them

Take
your
choice,
but
you
must
be
satisfied
with
only

quantity
of
merit
between
them;
just

of
man;
and
of
late
it
has
been
shifting
about
pretty
much.
For
my
part,
I
am
inclined
to
believe
it
all
Darcy's;
but
you
shall
do
as
you
choose."
It
was
some
time,
however,
before
a
smile
could
be
extorted
from
Jane.
"I
do
not
know
when
I
have
been
more
shocked,"
said
she.
"Wickham
so
very
bad!
It
is
almost
past
belief.
And
poor
Mr.
Darcy!
Dear
Lizzy,
only
consider
what
he
must
have
suffered.
Such
a
disappointment!
