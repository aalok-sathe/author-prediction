parents.
They
continued
together
with
unabated
regard
however,
till
the
marriage
of
Miss
Campbell,
who
by
that
chance,
that
luck
which
so
often
defies
anticipation
in
matrimonial
affairs,
giving
attraction
to
what
is
moderate
rather
than
to
what
is
superior,
engaged
the
affections
of
Mr.
Dixon,
a
young
man,
rich
and
agreeable,
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
acquainted;
and
was
eligibly
and
happily
settled,
while
Jane
Fairfax
had
yet
her
bread
to
earn.
This
event
had
very
lately
taken
place;
too
lately
for
any
thing
to
be
yet
attempted
by
her
less
fortunate
friend
towards
entering
on
her
path
of
duty;
though
she
had
now
reached
the
age
which
her
own
judgment
had
fixed
on
for
beginning.
She
had
long
resolved
that
one
and
twenty
should
be
the
period.
With
the
fortitude
of
a
devoted
novitiate,
she
had
resolved
at
one
and
twenty
to
complete
the
sacrifice,
and
retire
from
all
the
pleasures
of
life,
of
rational
intercourse,
equal
society,
peace
and
hope,
to
penance
and
mortification
for
ever.
The
good
sense
of
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
could
not
oppose
such
a
resolution,
though
their
feelings
did.
As
long
as
they
lived,
no
exertions
would
be
necessary,
their
home
