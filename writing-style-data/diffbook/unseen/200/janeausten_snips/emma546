ball,
which
she
walked
about
the
lawn
the
next
morning
to
enjoy.
She
was
extremely
glad
that
they
had
come
to
so
good
an
understanding
respecting
the
Eltons,
and
that
their
opinions
of
both
husband
and
wife
were
so
much
alike;
and
his
praise
of
Harriet,
his
concession
in
her
favour,
was
peculiarly
gratifying.
The
impertinence
of
the
Eltons,
which
for
a
few
minutes
had
threatened
to
ruin
the
rest
of
her
evening,
had
been
the
occasion
of
some
of
its
highest
satisfactions;
and
she
looked
forward
to
another
happy
result
the
cure
of
Harriet's
infatuation.
From
Harriet's
manner
of
speaking
of
the
circumstance
before
they
quitted
the
ballroom,
she
had
strong
hopes.
It
seemed
as
if
her
eyes
were
suddenly
opened,
and
she
were
enabled
to
see
that
Mr.
Elton
was
not
the
superior
creature
she
had
believed
him.
The
fever
was
over,
and
Emma
could
harbour
little
fear
of
the
pulse
being
quickened
again
by
injurious
courtesy.
She
depended
on
the
evil
feelings
of
the
Eltons
for
supplying
all
the
discipline
of
pointed
neglect
that
could
be
farther
requisite.
Harriet
