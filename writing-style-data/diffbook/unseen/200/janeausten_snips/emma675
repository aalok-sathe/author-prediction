Harriet
should
be
in
love
with
Mr.
Knightley,
than
with
Frank
Churchill?
Why
was
the
evil
so
dreadfully
increased
by
Harriet's
having
some
hope
of
a
return?
It
darted
through
her,
with
the
speed
of
an
arrow,
that
Mr.
Knightley
must
marry
no
one
but
herself!
Her
own
conduct,
as
well
as
her
own
heart,
was
before
her
in
the
same
few
minutes.
She
saw
it
all
with
a
clearness
which
had
never
blessed
her
before.
How
improperly
had
she
been
acting
by
Harriet!
How
inconsiderate,
how
indelicate,
how
irrational,
how
unfeeling
had
been
her
conduct!
What
blindness,
what
madness,
had
led
her
on!
It
struck
her
with
dreadful
force,
and
she
was
ready
to
give
it
every
bad
name
in
the
world.
Some
portion
of
respect
for
herself,
however,
in
spite
of
all
these
demerits
some
concern
for
her
own
appearance,
and
a
strong
sense
of
justice
by
Harriet
(there
would
be
no
need
of
compassion
to
the
girl
who
believed
herself
loved
by
Mr.
Knightley
but
justice
required
that
she
should
not
be
made
unhappy
by
any
coldness
now,)
gave
Emma
the
resolution
to
sit
and
endure
farther
with
calmness,
with
even
apparent
kindness.
For
her
own
advantage
