be
paid;
but
his
subsequent
object
was
to
lament
over
himself
for
the
heat
he
was
suffering,
and
the
walk
he
had
had
for
nothing.
"When
I
got
to
Donwell,"
said
he,
"Knightley
could
not
be
found.
Very
odd!
very
unaccountable!
after
the
note
I
sent
him
this
morning,
and
the
message
he
returned,
that
he
should
certainly
be
at
home
till
one."
"Donwell!"
cried
his
wife.
"My
dear
Mr.
E.,
you
have
not
been
to
Donwell!
You
mean
the
Crown;
you
come
from
the
meeting
at
the
Crown."
"No,
no,
that's
to
morrow;
and
I
particularly
wanted
to
see
Knightley
to
day
on
that
very
account.
Such
a
dreadful
broiling
morning!
I
went
over
the
fields
too
(speaking
in
a
tone
of
great
ill
usage,)
which
made
it
so
much
the
worse.
And
then
not
to
find
him
at
home!
I
assure
you
I
am
not
at
all
pleased.
And
no
apology
left,
no
message
for
me.
The
housekeeper
declared
she
knew
nothing
of
my
being
expected.
Very
extraordinary!
And
nobody
knew
at
all
which
way
he
was
gone.
Perhaps
to
Hartfield,
perhaps
to
the
Abbey
Mill,
perhaps
into
his
woods.
Miss
Woodhouse,
this
is
not
like

friend
