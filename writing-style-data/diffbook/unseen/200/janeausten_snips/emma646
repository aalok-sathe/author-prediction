favour
of
such
exercise
for
his
patient.
The
answer
was
only
in
this
short
note:
"Miss
Fairfax's
compliments
and
thanks,
but
is
quite
unequal
to
any
exercise."
Emma
felt
that
her
own
note
had
deserved
something
better;
but
it
was
impossible
to
quarrel
with
words,
whose
tremulous
inequality
shewed
indisposition
so
plainly,
and
she
thought
only
of
how
she
might
best
counteract
this
unwillingness
to
be
seen
or
assisted.
In
spite
of
the
answer,
therefore,
she
ordered
the
carriage,
and
drove
to
Mrs.
Bates's,
in
the
hope
that
Jane
would
be
induced
to
join
her
but
it
would
not
do;
Miss
Bates
came
to
the
carriage
door,
all
gratitude,
and
agreeing
with
her
most
earnestly
in
thinking
an
airing
might
be
of
the
greatest
service
and
every
thing
that
message
could
do
was
tried
but
all
in
vain.
Miss
Bates
was
obliged
to
return
without
success;
Jane
was
quite
unpersuadable;
the
mere
proposal
of
going
out
seemed
to
make
her
worse.
Emma
wished
she
could
have
seen
her,
and
tried
her
own
powers;
but,
almost
before
she
could
hint
the
wish,
Miss
Bates
made
it
appear
that
she
had
promised
her
niece
on
no
account
to
let
Miss
Woodhouse
in.
