all
the
advantages
of
Wickham's
removal
from
the
shire
as
clearly
as
Mr.
Gardiner
could
do.
But
Mrs.
Bennet
was
not
so
well
pleased
with
it.
Lydia's
being
settled
in
the
North,
just
when
she
had
expected
most
pleasure
and
pride
in
her
company,
for
she
had
by
no
means
given
up
her
plan
of
their
residing
in
Hertfordshire,
was
a
severe
disappointment;
and,
besides,
it
was
such
a
pity
that
Lydia
should
be
taken
from
a
regiment
where
she
was
acquainted
with
everybody,
and
had
so
many
favourites.
"She
is
so
fond
of
Mrs.
Forster,"
said
she,
"it
will
be
quite
shocking
to
send
her
away!
And
there
are
several
of
the
young
men,
too,
that
she
likes
very
much.
The
officers
may
not
be
so
pleasant
in
General
's
regiment."
His
daughter's
request,
for
such
it
might
be
considered,
of
being
admitted
into
her
family
again
before
she
set
off
for
the
North,
received
at
first
an
absolute
negative.
But
Jane
and
Elizabeth,
who
agreed
in
wishing,
for
the
sake
of
their
sister's
feelings
and
consequence,
that
she
should
be
noticed
on
her
marriage
by
her
parents,
urged
him
so
earnestly
yet
so
rationally
and
so
mildly,
to
