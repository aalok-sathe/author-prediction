herself
a
saucy
conscious
smile
about
it,
and
found
amusement
in
detecting
the
real
cause
of
that
violent
dislike
of
Mr.
Knightley's
marrying
Jane
Fairfax,
or
any
body
else,
which
at
the
time
she
had
wholly
imputed
to
the
amiable
solicitude
of
the
sister
and
the
aunt.
This
proposal
of
his,
this
plan
of
marrying
and
continuing
at
Hartfield
the
more
she
contemplated
it,
the
more
pleasing
it
became.
His
evils
seemed
to
lessen,
her
own
advantages
to
increase,
their
mutual
good
to
outweigh
every
drawback.
Such
a
companion
for
herself
in
the
periods
of
anxiety
and
cheerlessness
before
her!
Such
a
partner
in
all
those
duties
and
cares
to
which
time
must
be
giving
increase
of
melancholy!
She
would
have
been
too
happy
but
for
poor
Harriet;
but
every
blessing
of
her
own
seemed
to
involve
and
advance
the
sufferings
of
her
friend,
who
must
now
be
even
excluded
from
Hartfield.
The
delightful
family
party
which
Emma
was
securing
for
herself,
poor
Harriet
must,
in
mere
charitable
caution,
be
kept
at
a
distance
from.
She
would
be
a
loser
in
every
way.
Emma
could
not
deplore
her
future
absence
as
any
deduction
from
her
own
enjoyment.
In
such
