see
this
superior
treasure.
It
was
the
end
of
an
old
pencil,
the
part
without
any
lead.
"This
was
really
his,"
said
Harriet.
"Do
not
you
remember
one
morning?
no,
I
dare
say
you
do
not.
But
one
morning
I
forget
exactly
the
day
but
perhaps
it
was
the
Tuesday
or
Wednesday
before
that
evening,
he
wanted
to
make
a
memorandum
in
his

kept
my
eye
on

Emma;
"I

about
spruce
beer.
Oh!
yes
Mr.
Knightley
and
I
both
saying
we
liked
it,
and
Mr.
Elton's
seeming
resolved
to
learn
to
like
it
too.
I
perfectly
remember
it.
Stop;
Mr.
Knightley
was
standing
just
here,
