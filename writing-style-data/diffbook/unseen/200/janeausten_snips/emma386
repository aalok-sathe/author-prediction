please.
But
then,
Mrs.
Goddard
will
want
to
see
it.
And
I
could
take
the
pattern
gown
home
any
day.
But
I
shall
want
the
ribbon
directly
so
it
had
better
go
to
Hartfield
at
least
the
ribbon.
You
could
make
it
into
two
parcels,
Mrs.
Ford,
could
not
you?"
"It
is
not
worth
while,
Harriet,
to
give
Mrs.
Ford
the
trouble
of
two
parcels."
"No
more
it
is."
"No
trouble
in
the
world,
ma'am,"
said
the
obliging
Mrs.
Ford.
"Oh!
but
indeed
I
would
much
rather
have
it
only
in
one.
Then,
if
you
please,
you
shall
send
it
all
to
Mrs.
Goddard's
I
do
not
know
No,
I
think,
Miss
Woodhouse,
I
may
just
as
well
have
it
sent
to
Hartfield,
and
take
it
home
with
me
at
night.
What
do
you
advise?"
"That
you
do
not
give
another
half
second
to
the
subject.
To
Hartfield,
if
you
please,
Mrs.
Ford."
"Aye,
that
will
be
much
best,"
said
Harriet,
quite
satisfied,
"I
should
not
at
all
like
to
have
it
sent
to
Mrs.
Goddard's."
Voices
approached
the
shop
or
rather
one
voice
and
two
ladies:
Mrs.
Weston
and
Miss
Bates
met
them
at
the
door.
"My
dear
Miss
