to
avoid
a
family
circle
was
even
more
desirable
to
such
as
did
think,
than
such
as
did
not.
Wickham's
affection
for
Lydia
was
just
what
Elizabeth
had
expected
to
find
it;
not
equal
to
Lydia's
for
him.
She
had
scarcely
needed
her
present
observation
to
be
satisfied,
from
the
reason
of
things,
that
their
elopement
had
been
brought

in
the
world;
and
she
was
sure
he
would
kill
more
birds
on
the
first

September,
than
any
body
else
in
the
country.
One
morning,
soon
after
their
arrival,
as
she
was
sitting

her
two
elder
sisters,
she
said
to
Elizabeth:
