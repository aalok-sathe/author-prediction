service
to
her,
or
else
it
is
to
be
attributed
to
an
excellent
embrocation
of
Mr.
Wingfield's,
which
we
have
been
applying
at
times
ever
since
August."
"It
is
not
very
likely,
my
dear,
that
bathing
should
have
been
of
use
to
her
and
if
I
had
known
you
were
wanting
an
embrocation,
I
would
have
spoken
to
"You
seem
to
me
to
have
forgotten
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates,"
said
Emma,
"I
have
not
heard
one
inquiry
after
them."
"Oh!
the
good
Bateses
I
am
quite
ashamed
of
myself
but
you
mention
them
in
most
of
your
letters.
I
hope
they
are
quite
well.
Good
old
Mrs.
Bates
I
will
call
upon
her
to
morrow,
and
take
my
children.
They
are
always
so
pleased
to
see
my
children.
And
that
excellent
Miss
Bates!
such
thorough
worthy
people!
How
are
they,
sir?"
"Why,
pretty
well,
my
dear,
upon
the
whole.
But
poor
Mrs.
Bates
had
a
bad
cold
about
a
month
ago."
"How
sorry
I
am!
But
colds
were
never
so
prevalent
as
they
have
been
this
autumn.
Mr.
Wingfield
told
me
that
he
has
never
known
them
more
general
or
heavy
except
when
it
has
been
quite
an
influenza."
"That
