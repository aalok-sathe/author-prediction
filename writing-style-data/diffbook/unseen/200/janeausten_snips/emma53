on
Harriet's
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
the
idea
of
being
preferred
by
him
would
have
all
the
usual
weight
and
efficacy.
And
he
was
really
a
very
pleasing
young
man,
a
young
man
whom
any
woman
not
fastidious
might
like.
He
was
reckoned
very
handsome;
his
person
much
admired
in
general,
though
not
by
her,
there
being
a
want
of
elegance
of
feature
which
she
could
not
dispense
with:
but
the
girl
who
could
be
gratified
by
a
Robert
Martin's
riding
about
the
country
to
get
walnuts
for
her
might
very
well
be
conquered
by
Mr.
Elton's
admiration.
"I
do
not
know
what
your
opinion
may
be,
Mrs.
Weston,"
said
Mr.
Knightley,
"of
this
great
intimacy
between
Emma
and
Harriet
Smith,
but
I
think
it
a
bad
thing."
"A
bad
thing!
Do
you
really
think
it
a
bad
thing?
why
so?"
"I
think
they
will
neither
of
them
do
the
other
any
good."
"You
surprize
me!
Emma
must
do
Harriet
good:
and
by
supplying
her
with
a
new
object
of
interest,
Harriet
may
be
said
to
do
Emma
good.
I
have
been
seeing
their
intimacy
with
the
greatest
pleasure.
How
very
differently
we
feel!
Not
think
they
will
