world,
excepting
that
trunk
and
the
direction,
was
consequently
a
blank.
She
went,
however;
and
when
they
reached
the
farm,
and
she
was
to
be
put
down,
at
the
end
of
the
broad,
neat
gravel
walk,
which
led
between
espalier
apple
trees

again;
and
Miss
Smith

her
summons,
was
with

man.
She
came
solitarily
down
the
gravel
walk
a
Miss
Martin
just

door,
and
parting
with
her
seemingly
