Mr.
Darcy."
She
then
sought
her
eldest
sister,
who
had
undertaken
to
make
inquiries
on
the
same
subject
of
Bingley.
Jane
met
her
with
a
smile
of
such
sweet
complacency,
a
glow
of
such
happy
expression,
as
sufficiently
marked
how
well
she
was
satisfied
with
the
occurrences
of
the
evening.
Elizabeth
instantly
read
her
feelings,
and

whole
of
his
history,
and
is
quite
ignorant
of
the
circumstances
which

good
conduct,
the
probity,
and
honour
of
his
friend,
and
