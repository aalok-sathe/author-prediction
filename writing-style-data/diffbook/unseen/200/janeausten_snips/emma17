and
a
very
good
young
man,
and
I
have
a
great
regard
for
him.
But
if
you
want
to
shew
him
any
attention,
my
dear,
ask
him
to
come
and
dine
with
us
some
day.
That
will
be
a
much
better
thing.
I
dare
say
Mr.
Knightley
will
be
so
kind
as
to
meet
him."
"With
a
great
deal
of
pleasure,
sir,
at
any
time,"
said
Mr.
Knightley,
laughing,
"and
I
agree
with
you
entirely,
that
it
will
be
a
much
better
thing.
Invite
him
to
dinner,
Emma,
and
help
him
to
the

the
fish
and
the
chicken,
but
leave
him
to
chuse
his
own
wife.
Depend
upon
it,
a
man
of
six
or
seven
and
twenty
can
take
care
of
himself."
Mr.
Weston
was
a
native
of
Highbury,
and
born
of
a
respectable
family,
which
for
the
last
two
or
three
generations
had
been
rising
into
gentility
and
property.
He
had
received
a
good
education,
but,
on
succeeding
early
in
life
to
a
small
independence,
had
become
indisposed
for
any
of
the
more
homely
pursuits
in
which
his
brothers
were
engaged,
and
had
satisfied
an
active,
cheerful
mind
and
social
temper
by
entering
into
the
militia
