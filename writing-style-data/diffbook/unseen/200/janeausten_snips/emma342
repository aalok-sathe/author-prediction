summer
evening
are
what
I
would
not
expose
any
body
to.
However,
as
they
are
so
very
desirous
to
have
dear
Emma
dine
with
them,
and
as
you
will
both
be
there,
and
Mr.
Knightley
too,
to
take
care
of
her,
I
cannot
wish
to
prevent
it,
provided
the
weather
be
what
it
ought,
neither
damp,
nor
cold,
nor
windy."
Then
turning
to
Mrs.
Weston,
with
a
look
of
gentle
reproach
"Ah!
Miss
Taylor,
if
you
had
not
married,
you
would
have
staid
at
home
with
me."
"Well,
sir,"
cried
Mr.
Weston,
"as
I
took
Miss
Taylor
away,
it
is
incumbent
on
me
to
supply
her
place,
if
I
can;
and
I
will
step
to
Mrs.
Goddard
in
a
moment,
if
you
wish
it."
But
the
idea
of
any
thing
to
be
done
in
a
moment,
was
increasing,
not
lessening,
Mr.
Woodhouse's
agitation.
The
ladies
knew
better
how
to
allay
it.
Mr.
Weston
must
be
quiet,
and
every
thing
deliberately
arranged.
With
this
treatment,
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
soon
composed
enough
for
talking
as
usual.
"He
should
be
happy
to
see
Mrs.
Goddard.
He
had
a
great
regard
for
Mrs.
Goddard;
and
Emma
should
write
a
line,
and
invite
her.
