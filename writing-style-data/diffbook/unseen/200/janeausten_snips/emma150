maternal
solicitude
for
the
immediate
enjoyment
of
her
little
ones,
and
for
their
having
instantly
all
the
liberty
and
attendance,
all
the
eating
and
drinking,
and
sleeping
and
playing,
which
they
could
possibly
wish
for,
without
the
smallest
delay,
the
children
were
never
allowed
to
be
long
a
disturbance
to
him,
either
in
themselves
or
in
any
restless
attendance
on
them.
Mrs.
John
Knightley
was
a
pretty,
elegant
little
woman,
of
gentle,
quiet
manners,
and
a
disposition
remarkably
amiable
and
affectionate;
wrapt

in
her
family;
a

could
never
see
a
fault
in
any

them.
She
was
not
a

of
strong
understanding
or
any
quickness;
and
with
this
resemblance
of
her
father,
she
inherited
also
much
of
his
constitution;
was
delicate
in
her
own
health,
over
careful
of
that
of
her
children,
had
many
fears
and
many
nerves,
and
was
as
fond
of
her
own
Mr.
Wingfield
in
town
as
her
father
could
be
of
Mr.
Perry.
They
were
alike
too,
in
a
general
benevolence
of
temper,
and
a
