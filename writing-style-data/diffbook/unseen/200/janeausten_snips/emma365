his
chair,
it
was
taken
by
Mrs.
Weston.
"This
is
the
luxury
of
a
large
party,"
said
she:
"one
can
get
near
every
body,
and
say
every
thing.
My
dear
Emma,
I
am
longing
to
talk
to
you.
I
have
been
making
discoveries
and
forming
plans,
just
like
yourself,
and
I
must
tell
them
while
the
idea
is
fresh.
Do
you
know
how
Miss
Bates
and
her
niece
came
here?"
"How?
They
were
invited,
were
not
they?"
"Oh!
yes
but
how
they
were
conveyed
hither?
the
manner
of
their
coming?"
"They
walked,
I
conclude.
How
else
could
they
come?"
"Very
true.
Well,
a
little
while
ago
it
occurred
to
me
how
very
sad
it
would
be
to
have
Jane
Fairfax
walking
home
again,
late
at
night,
and
cold
as
the
nights
are
now.
And
as
I
looked
at
her,
though
I
never
saw
her
appear
to
more
advantage,
it
struck
me
that
she
was
heated,
and
would
therefore
be
particularly
liable
to
take
cold.
Poor
girl!
I
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
it;
so,
as
soon
as
Mr.
Weston
came
into
the
room,
and
I
could
get
at
him,
I
spoke
to
him
about
the
carriage.
You
may
guess
