him
by
Mrs.
Reynolds
was
of
no
trifling
nature.
What
praise
is
more
valuable
than
the
praise
of
an
intelligent
servant?
As
a
brother,
a
landlord,
a
master,
she
considered
how
many
people's
happiness
were
in
his
guardianship!
how
much
of
pleasure
or
pain
was
it
in
his
power
to
bestow!
how
much
of
good
or

had
been
brought
forward
by
the

of
the
housekeeper,
were
consigned
over

the
gardener,
who
met
them
at
the
hall
door.
As
they
walked
across
the
hall
towards
the
river,
Elizabeth
turned
back
to
look
again;
her
uncle
and
aunt
stopped
also,
and
while
the
former
was
conjecturing
as
