have
been
enough.
And
now
she
was
very
conscious
that
she
ought
to
have
prevented
them.
She
felt
that
she
had
been
risking
her
friend's
happiness
on
most
insufficient
grounds.
Common
sense
would
have
directed
her
to
tell
Harriet,
that
she
must
not
allow
herself
to
think
of
him,
and
that
there
were
five
hundred
chances
to
one
against
his
ever
caring
for
her.
"But,
with
common
sense,"
she
added,
"I
am
afraid
I
have
had
little
to
do."
She
was
extremely
angry
with
herself.
If
she
could
not
have
been
angry
with
Frank

it
would
have
been
dreadful.
As
for
Jane
Fairfax,
she
might
at

relieve
her
feelings
from
any
present
solicitude
on
her
account.
Harriet
would
be
anxiety

she
need
no

be
unhappy
about
Jane,
whose
troubles
and
whose
ill
health
having,
of
course,
the
same
origin,
must
be
equally
under
cure.
Her
days
of
insignificance
and
evil
were
over.
She
would
soon
be
well,
and
happy,
and
prosperous.
Emma
could
now
imagine
why
her
own
attentions
had
been
slighted.
This
discovery
laid
many
smaller
matters
open.
No
doubt
it
had
been
from
jealousy.
In
Jane's
eyes
she
had
been
a
rival;
and
