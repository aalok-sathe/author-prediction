Her
tears
fell
abundantly
but
her
grief
was
so
truly
artless,
that
no
dignity
could
have
made
it
more
respectable
in
Emma's
eyes
and
she
listened
to
her
and
tried
to
console
her
with
all
her
heart
and
understanding
really
for
the
time
convinced
that
Harriet
was
the
superior
creature
of
the
two
and
that
to
resemble
her
would
be
more
for
her
own
welfare
and
happiness
than
all
that
genius
or
intelligence
could
do.
It
was
rather
too
late
in
the
day
to
set
about
being
simple
minded
and
ignorant;
but
she
left
her
with
every
previous
resolution
confirmed
of
being
humble
and
discreet,
and
repressing
imagination
all
the
rest
of
her
life.
Her
second
duty
now,
inferior
only
to
her
father's
claims,
was
to
promote
Harriet's
comfort,
and
endeavour
to
prove
her
own
affection
in
some
better
method
than
by
match
making.
She
got
her
to
Hartfield,
and
shewed
her
the
most
unvarying
kindness,
striving
to
occupy
and
amuse
her,
and
by
books
and
conversation,
to
drive
Mr.
Elton
from
her
thoughts.
Time,
she
knew,
must
be
allowed
for
this
being
thoroughly
done;
and
she
could
suppose
herself
but
an
indifferent
judge
of
such
matters
in
general,
and
