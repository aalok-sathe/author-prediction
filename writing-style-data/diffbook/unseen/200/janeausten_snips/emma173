my
dear
sir,
the
difference
of
the
journey;
only
consider
how
great
it
would
have
been.
An
hundred
miles,
perhaps,
instead
of
forty."
"Ah!
my
dear,
as
Perry
says,
where
health
is
at
stake,
nothing
else
should
be
considered;
and
if
one
is
to
travel,
there
is
not
much
to
chuse
between
forty
miles
and
an
hundred.
Better
not
move
at
all,
better
stay
in
London
altogether
than
travel
forty
miles
to
get
into
a
worse
air.
This
is
just
what
Perry
said.
It
seemed
to
him
a
very
ill
judged
measure."
Emma's
attempts
to
stop
her
father
had
been
vain;
and
when
he
had
reached
such
a
point
as
this,
she
could
not
wonder
at
her
brother
in
law's
breaking
out.
"Mr.
Perry,"
said
he,
in
a
voice
of
very
strong
displeasure,
"would
do
as
well
to
keep
his
opinion
till
it
is
asked
for.
Why
does
he
make
it
any
business
of
his,
to
wonder
at
what
I
do?
at
my
taking
my
family
to
one
part
of
the
coast
or
another?
I
may
be
allowed,
I
hope,
the
use
of
my
judgment
as
well
as
Mr.
Perry.
I
want
his
directions
no
more
than
his
drugs."
