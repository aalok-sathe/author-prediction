that
more
than
a
thousand
pounds
would
be
necessary
to
clear
his
expenses
at
Brighton.
He
owed
a
good
deal
in
town,
but
his
debts
of
honour
were
still
more
formidable.
Mr.
Gardiner
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
these
particulars
from
the
Longbourn
family.
Jane
heard

of
this,
she

not
express
so

her
children
expected,
considering
