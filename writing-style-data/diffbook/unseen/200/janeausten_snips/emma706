creature."
"Mr.
Knightley,"
said
Emma,
trying
to
be
lively,
but
really
confused
"I
am
in
a
very
extraordinary
situation.
I
cannot
let
you
continue
in
your
error;
and
yet,
perhaps,
since
my
manners
gave
such
an
impression,
I
have
as

and
allowed
myself
to
appear
pleased.
An
old
story,
probably
a
common
case
and
no
more
than
has
happened
to
hundreds
of
my
sex
before;
and
yet
it
may
not
be
the
more
excusable
