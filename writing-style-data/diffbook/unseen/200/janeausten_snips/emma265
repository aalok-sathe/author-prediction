by
the
attendance
of
first
rate
masters.
Her
disposition
and
abilities
were
equally
worthy
of
all
that
friendship
could
do;
and
at
eighteen
or
nineteen
she
was,
as
far
as
such
an
early
age
can
be
qualified
for
the
care
of
children,
fully
competent
to
the
office
of
instruction
herself;
but
she
was
too
much
beloved
to
be
parted
with.
Neither
father
nor
mother
could
promote,
and
the
daughter
could
not
endure
it.
The
evil
day
was
put
off.
It
was
easy
to
decide
that
she
was
still
too

and
Jane
remained
with
them,
sharing,
as
another
daughter,

the
drawback
of
the
future,

sobering
suggestions
of
her
own
good
understanding
to
remind
her
that
all
this
might
soon
be
over.
The
affection
of
the
whole
family,
the
warm
attachment
of
Miss
Campbell
in
particular,
was
the
more
honourable
to
each
party
from
the
circumstance
of
Jane's
decided
superiority
both
in
beauty
and
acquirements.
That
nature
had
given
it
in
feature
could
not
be
unseen
by
the
young
woman,
nor
could
her
higher
powers
of
