pianoforte,
she
felt
too
much
in
the
secret
herself,
to
think
the
appearance
of
curiosity
or
interest
fair,
and
therefore
purposely
kept
at
a
distance;
but
by
the
others,
the
subject
was
almost
immediately
introduced,
and
she
saw
the
blush
of
consciousness
with
which
congratulations
were
received,

accompanied
the
name

interested
by
the

Emma
could
not

she
plainly
read
in
the
fair
heroine's
countenance.
They

and
the

Frank
Churchill.
In

walked,
the
first
and
the
handsomest;
and
after
paying
his
compliments
en

to
Miss
Bates
and
her
niece,
made
his
way
directly
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
circle,
where
sat
Miss
Woodhouse;
and

could
find
a
seat

would
not
