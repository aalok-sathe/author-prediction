not
six
months
ago!
Emma
could
not
but
picture
it
all,
and
feel
how
justly
they
might
resent,
how
naturally
Harriet
must
suffer.
It
was
a
bad
business.
She
would
have
given
a
great
deal,
or
endured
a
great
deal,
to
have
had
the
Martins
in
a
higher
rank
of
life.
They
were
so
deserving,
that
a
little
higher
should
have
been
enough:
but
as
it
was,
how
could
she
have
done
otherwise?
Impossible!
She
could
not
repent.
They
must
be
separated;
but
there
was
a

and

The
refreshment
of
Randalls
was
absolutely
necessary.
It
was
a
good
scheme;
but
on
driving
to
the
door
they
heard
that
neither
"master
nor
mistress
was
at
home;"
they
had
both
been
out
some
time;
the
man
believed
they
were
gone
to
Hartfield.
"This
is
too
bad,"
cried
Emma,
as
they
turned
away.
"And
now
we
shall
just
miss
them;
too
provoking!
I
do
not
know
