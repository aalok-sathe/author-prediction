unconsciously
so
strong
an
affection.
But
his
pride,
his
abominable
pride
his
shameless
avowal
of
what
he
had
done
with
respect
to
Jane
his
unpardonable
assurance
in
acknowledging,
though
he
could
not
justify
it,
and
the
unfeeling
manner
in
which
he
had
mentioned
Mr.
Wickham,
his
cruelty
towards
whom

employment,
she
resolved,
soon
after
breakfast,
to
indulge
herself
in
air
and
exercise.
She
was
proceeding
directly
to
her
favourite
walk,
when
the
recollection
of
Mr.
Darcy's
sometimes
coming
there
stopped

and
instead
of
entering
the
