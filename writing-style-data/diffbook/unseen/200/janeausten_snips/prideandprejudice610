had
the
highest
opinion
in
the
world
of
Elizabeth;
though
at
first
she
often
listened
with
an
astonishment
bordering
on
alarm
at
her
lively,
sportive,
manner
of
talking
to
her
brother.
He,
who
had
always
inspired
in
herself
a
respect
which
almost
overcame
her
affection,
she
now
saw
the
object
of
open
pleasantry.
Her
mind
received
knowledge
which
had
never
before
fallen
in
her
way.
By
Elizabeth's
instructions,
she
began
to
comprehend
that
a
woman
may
take
liberties
with
her
husband
which
a
brother
will
not
always
allow
in
a
sister
more
than
ten
years
younger
than
himself.
Lady
Catherine
was
extremely
indignant
on
the
marriage
of
her
nephew;
and
as
she
gave
way
to
all
the
genuine
frankness
of
her
character
in
her
reply
to
the
letter
which
announced
its
arrangement,
she
sent
him
language
so
very
abusive,
especially
of
Elizabeth,
that
for
some
time
all
intercourse
was
at
an
end.
But
at
length,
by
Elizabeth's
persuasion,
he
was
prevailed
on
to
overlook
the
offence,
and
seek
a
reconciliation;
and,
after
a
little
further
resistance
on
the
part
of
his
aunt,
her
resentment
gave
way,
either
to
her
affection
for
him,
or
her
curiosity
to
see
how

wife
