sick
of
the
very
name
of
Jane
Fairfax.
Every
letter
from
her
is
read
forty
times
over;
her
compliments
to
all
friends
go
round
and
round
again;
and
if
she
does
but
send
her
aunt
the
pattern
of
a
stomacher,
or
knit
a
pair
of
garters
for
her
grandmother,
one
hears
of
nothing
else
for
a
month.
I
wish
Jane
Fairfax
very
well;
but
she
tires
me
to
death."
They
were
now
approaching
the
cottage,
and
all
idle
topics
were
superseded.
Emma
was
very
compassionate;
and
the
distresses
of
the
poor
were
as
sure
of
relief
from
her
personal
attention
and
kindness,
her
counsel
and
her
patience,
as
from
her
purse.
She
understood
their
ways,
could
allow
for
their
ignorance
and
their
temptations,
had
no
romantic
expectations
of
extraordinary
virtue
from
those
for
whom
education
had
done
so
little;
entered
into
their
troubles
with
ready
sympathy,
and
always
gave
her
assistance
with
as
much
intelligence
as
good
will.
In
the
present
instance,
it
was
sickness
and
poverty
together
which
she
came
to
visit;
and
after
remaining
there
as
long
as
she
could
give
comfort
or
advice,
she
quitted
the
cottage
with
such
an
impression
of
the
scene
as
made
