comfort
is,
I
am
sure
Jane
will
die
of
a
broken
heart;
and
then
he
will
be
sorry
for
what
he
has
done."
But
as
Elizabeth
could
not
receive
comfort
from
any
such
expectation,
she
made
no
answer.
"Well,
Lizzy,"
continued
her
mother,
soon
afterwards,
"and
so
the
Collinses
live
very
comfortable,
do
they?
Well,
well,
I
only
hope
it
will
last.
And
what
sort
of
table
do
they
keep?
Charlotte
is
an
excellent
manager,
I
dare
say.
If
she
is
half
as
sharp
as
her
mother,
she
is
saving
enough.
There
is
nothing
extravagant
in
their
housekeeping,
I
dare
say."
"No,
nothing
at
all."
"A
great
deal
of
good
management,
depend
upon
it.
Yes,
yes,
they
will
take
care
not
to
outrun
their
income.
They
will
never
be
distressed
for
money.
Well,
much
good
may
it
do
them!
And
so,
I
suppose,
they
often
talk
of
having
Longbourn
when
your
father
is
dead.
They
look
upon
it
as
quite
their
own,
I
dare
say,
whenever
that
happens."
"It
was
a
subject
which
they
could
not
mention
before
me."
"No;
it
would
have
been
strange
if
they
had;
but
I
make
no
doubt
they
often
talk
of
it
between
themselves.
