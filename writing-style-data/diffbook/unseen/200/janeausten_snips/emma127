and
we
have
just
copied
it
in."
She
read
it
to
him,
just
as
he
liked
to
have
any
thing
read,
slowly
and
distinctly,
and
two
or
three
times
over,
with
explanations
of
every
part
as
she
proceeded
and
he
was
very
much
pleased,
and,

but
her
memory!
But
I

remember
nothing;
not
even
that
particular
riddle
which
you
have
heard
me
mention;
I
can
only
recollect
the
first
stanza;
and
there
are
several.
Kitty,
a
fair

The
hood
wink'd

I
