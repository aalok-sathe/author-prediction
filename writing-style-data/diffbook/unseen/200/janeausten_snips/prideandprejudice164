amiable
in
my
eyes
had
there
not
been
this
little
unwillingness;
but
allow
me
to
assure
you,
that
I
have
your
respected
mother's
permission
for
this
address.
You
can
hardly
doubt
the
purport
of
my
discourse,
however
your
natural
delicacy
may
lead
you
to
dissemble;
my
attentions
have
been
too
marked
to
be
mistaken.
Almost

as
I
entered

future
life.

I
am

made
Elizabeth
so
near
laughing,
that
she
could
not
use
the
short
pause
he
allowed
in
any
attempt
to
stop
him
further,
and
he
continued:
"My
reasons
for
marrying
are,
first,
that
I
think
it
a
right
thing
for
every
clergyman
in
easy
circumstances
(like
myself)
to
set
the
example
of
matrimony
in
his
parish;
secondly,
that
I
am
convinced
