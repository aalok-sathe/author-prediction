with
doubtful
feelings,
with
half
a
heart.
I
thought
it
my
duty
as
a
friend,
and
older
than
yourself,
to
say
thus
much
to
you.
But
do
not
imagine
that
I
want
to
influence
you."
"Oh!
no,
I
am
sure
you
are
a
great
deal
too
kind
to
but
if
you
would
just
advise
me
what
I
had
best
do
No,
no,
I
do
not
mean
that
As
you
say,
one's
mind
ought
to
be
quite

should
not
be

is
a
very
serious
thing.
It
will
be
safer
to
say
'No,'

Do
you
think
I
had

the
world,"

Emma,
smiling
graciously,
"would
I
advise
you
either
way.
You
must
be
the
best
judge
of
your
own
happiness.
If
you
prefer
Mr.
Martin
to
every
other
person;
if
you
think
him
the
most
agreeable
man
you
have
ever
been
in
company
with,
why
should
you
hesitate?
You
blush,
Harriet.
Does
any
body
else
occur
to
you
at
this
moment
under
such
a
definition?
Harriet,
Harriet,
do
not
deceive
yourself;
do
not
be
run
away
with
by
gratitude
and
compassion.
At
this
moment
whom
are
you
thinking
of?"
