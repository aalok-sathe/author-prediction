walk
about
your
gardens,
and
gather
the
strawberries
ourselves,
and
sit
under
trees;
and
whatever
else
you
may
like
to
provide,
it
is
to
be
all
out
of
doors
a
table
spread
in
the
shade,
you
know.
Every
thing
as
natural
and
simple
as
possible.
Is
not
that
your
idea?"
"Not
quite.
My
idea
of
the
simple
and
the
natural
will
be
to
have
the
table
spread
in
the
dining
room.
The
nature
and
the
simplicity
of
gentlemen
and
ladies,
with
their
servants
and
furniture,
I
think
is
best
observed
by
meals
within
doors.
When
you
are
tired
of
eating
strawberries
in
the
garden,
there
shall
be
cold
meat
in
the
house."
"Well
as
you
please;
only
don't
have
a
great
set
out.
And,
by
the
bye,
can
I
or
my
housekeeper
be
of
any
use
to
you
with
our
opinion?
Pray
be
sincere,
Knightley.
If
you
wish
me
to
talk
to
Mrs.
Hodges,
or
to
inspect
anything
"
"I
have
not
the
least
wish
for
it,
I
thank
you."
"Well
but
if
any
difficulties
should
arise,
my
housekeeper
is
extremely
clever."
"I
will
answer
for
it,
that
mine
thinks
herself
full
as
clever,
and
would
spurn
any
body's
assistance."
