misapply
it
as
you
do."
"To
be
sure!"
cried
she
playfully.
"I
know
that
is
the
feeling
of
you
all.
I
know
that
such
a
girl
as
Harriet
is
exactly
what
every
man
delights
in
what
at
once
bewitches
his
senses
and
satisfies
his
judgment.
Oh!
Harriet
may
pick
and
chuse.
Were
you,
yourself,
ever
to
marry,
she
is
the
very
woman
for
you.
And
is
she,
at
seventeen,
just
entering
into
life,
just
beginning
to
be
known,
to
be
wondered
at
because
she
does
not
accept
the
first
offer
she
receives?
No
pray
let
her
have
time
to
look
about
her."
"I
have
always
thought
it
a
very
foolish
intimacy,"
said
Mr.
Knightley
presently,
"though
I
have
kept
my
thoughts
to
myself;
but
I
now
perceive
that
it
will
be
a
very
unfortunate
one
for
Harriet.
You
will
puff
her
up
with
such
ideas
of
her
own
beauty,
and
of
what
she
has
a
claim
to,
that,
in
a
little
while,
nobody
within
her
reach
will
be
good
enough
for
her.
Vanity
working
on
a
weak
head,
produces
every
sort
of
mischief.
Nothing
so
easy
as
for
a
young
lady
to
raise
her
expectations
too
high.
Miss
Harriet
Smith
