Mrs.
John
Knightley.
"It
is
so
long
since
I
have
seen
her,
except
now
and
then
for
a
moment
accidentally
in
town!
What
happiness
it
must
be
to
her
good
old
grandmother
and
excellent
aunt,
when
she
comes
to
visit
them!
I
always
regret
excessively
on
dear
Emma's
account
that
she
cannot
be
more
at
Highbury;
but
now
their
daughter
is
married,
I
suppose
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
will
not
be
able
to
part
with
her
at
all.
She
would
be
such
a
delightful
companion
for
Emma."
Mr.
Woodhouse
agreed
to
it
all,
but
added,
"Our
little
friend
Harriet
Smith,
however,
is
just
such
another
pretty
kind
of
young
person.
You
will
like
Harriet.
Emma
could
not
have
a
better
companion
than
Harriet."
"I
am
most
happy
to
hear
it
but
only
Jane
Fairfax
one
knows
to
be
so
very
accomplished
and
superior!
and
exactly
Emma's
age."
This
topic
was
discussed
very
happily,
and
others
succeeded
of
similar
moment,
and
passed
away
with
similar
harmony;
but
the
evening
did
not
close
without
a
little
return
of
agitation.
The
gruel
came
and
supplied
a
great
deal
to
be
said
much
praise
and
many
comments
undoubting
decision
of
its
wholesomeness
for
every
