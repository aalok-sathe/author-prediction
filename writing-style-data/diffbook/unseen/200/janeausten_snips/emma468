some
amusement.
Miss
Bates's
gratitude
for
Mrs.
Elton's
attentions
to
Jane
was
in
the
first
style
of
guileless
simplicity
and
warmth.
She
was
quite
one
of
her
worthies
the
most
amiable,
affable,
delightful
woman
just
as
accomplished
and
condescending
as
Mrs.
Elton
meant
to
be
considered.
Emma's
only
surprize
was
that
Jane
Fairfax
should
accept
those
attentions
and
tolerate
Mrs.
Elton
as
she
seemed
to
do.
She
heard
of
her
walking
with
the
Eltons,
sitting
with
the
Eltons,
spending
a
day
with
the
Eltons!
This
was
astonishing!
She
could
not
have
believed
it
possible
that
the
taste
or
the
pride
of
Miss
Fairfax
could
endure
such
society
and
friendship
as
the
Vicarage
had
to
offer.
"She
is
a
riddle,
quite
a
riddle!"
said
she.
"To
chuse
to
remain
here
month
after
month,
under
privations
of
every
sort!
And
now
to
chuse
the
mortification
of
Mrs.
Elton's
notice
and
the
penury
of
her
conversation,
rather
than
return
to
the
superior
companions
who
have
always
loved
her
with
such
real,
generous
affection."
Jane
had
come
to
Highbury
professedly
for
three
months;
the
Campbells
were
gone
to
Ireland
for
three
months;
but
now
the
Campbells
had
promised
their
daughter
to
stay
at
least
