in
silence;
and,
at
last,
on
the
young
lady's
whispering
to
Elizabeth
again,
he
walked
away.
When
the
tea
things
were
removed,
and
the
card
tables
placed,
the
ladies
all
rose,
and
Elizabeth
was
then
hoping
to
be
soon
joined
by
him,
when
all
her
views
were
overthrown
by
seeing
him
fall
a
victim
to
her
mother's
rapacity
for
whist
players,
and
in
a
few
moments
after
seated
with
the
rest
of
the
party.
She
now
lost
every
expectation
of
pleasure.
They
were
confined
for
the
evening
at
different
tables,
and
she
had
nothing
to
hope,
but
that
his
eyes
were
so
often
turned
towards
her
side
of
the
room,
as
to
make
him
play
as
unsuccessfully
as
herself.
Mrs.
Bennet
had
designed
to
keep
the
two
Netherfield
gentlemen
to
supper;
but
their
carriage
was
unluckily
ordered
before
any
of
the
others,
and
she
had
no
opportunity
of
detaining
them.
"Well
girls,"
said
she,
as
soon
as
they
were
left
to
themselves,
"What
say
you
to
the
day?
I
think
every
thing
has
passed
off
uncommonly
well,
I
assure
you.
The
dinner
was
as
well
dressed
as
any
I
ever
saw.
The
venison
was
roasted
to
a
turn
and
everybody
