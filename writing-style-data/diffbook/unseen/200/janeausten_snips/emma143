produced
exertion
and
relief
to
the
sufferers,
it
has
done
all
that
is
truly
important.
If
we
feel
for
the
wretched,
enough
to
do
all
we
can
for
them,
the
rest
is
empty
sympathy,
only
distressing
to
ourselves."
Harriet
could
just
answer,
"Oh!
dear,
yes,"
before
the
gentleman
joined
them.
The
wants
and
sufferings
of
the
poor
family,
however,
were
the
first
subject
on
meeting.
He
had
been
going
to
call
on
them.
His
visit
he
would
now
defer;
but
they
had
a
very
interesting

I
should
not
wonder
if
it

It
must,
if
I
were
not
here.
I
wish
I
were
anywhere
else."
Anxious
to
separate
herself
from
them
as
far
as
she
could,
she
soon
afterwards
took
possession
of
a
narrow
footpath,
a
little
raised
on
one
side
of
the
lane,
leaving
them
