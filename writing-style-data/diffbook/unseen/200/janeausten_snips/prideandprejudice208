that
easiness
of
temper,
that
want
of
proper
resolution,
which
now
made
him
the
slave
of
his
designing
friends,
and
led
him
to
sacrifice
of
his
own
happiness
to
the
caprice
of
their
inclination.
Had
his
own
happiness,
however,
been
the
only
sacrifice,
he
might
have
been
allowed
to
sport
with
it
in
whatever
manner
he
thought
best,
but
her
sister's
was
involved
in
it,
as
she
thought

must
be
sensible
himself.
It
was
a
subject,
in
short,
on
which
reflection
would
be
long
indulged,
and
must
be
unavailing.
She

opinion
of
him
must
be
materially
affected
by
the
difference,
her
sister's
situation
remained
the
same,
her
peace
equally
wounded.
A
day
or
two
passed
before
Jane
had
courage
to
speak
of
her
feelings
to
Elizabeth;
but
at
last,
on
Mrs.
Bennet's
leaving
them
together,
after
a
longer
irritation
than
usual

she
could
not
