there
two
minutes
when
she
found
that
Harriet's
habits
of
dependence
and
imitation
were
bringing
her
up
too,
and
that,
in
short,
they
would
both
be
soon
after
her.
This
would
not
do;
she
immediately
stopped,
under
pretence
of
having
some
alteration
to
make
in
the
lacing
of
her
half
boot,
and
stooping
down
in
complete
occupation
of
the
footpath,
begged
them
to
have
the
goodness
to
walk
on,
and
she
would
follow
in
half
a
minute.
They
did
as
they
were
desired;
and
by
the
time
she
judged
it
reasonable
to
have
done
with
her
boot,
she
had
the
comfort
of
farther
delay
in
her
power,
being
overtaken
by
a
child
from
the
cottage,
setting
out,
according
to
orders,
with
her
pitcher,
to
fetch
broth
from
Hartfield.
To
walk
by
the
side
of
this
child,
and
talk
to
and
question
her,
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world,
or
would
have
been
the
most
natural,
had
she
been
acting
just
then
without
design;
and
by
this
means
the
others
were
still
able
to
keep
ahead,
without
any
obligation
of
waiting
for
her.
She
gained
on
them,
however,
involuntarily:
the
child's
pace
was
quick,
and
theirs
rather
slow;
and
