Their
father
then
went
on
to
the
library
to
write,
and
the
girls
walked
into
the
breakfast
room.
"And
they
are
really
to
be
married!"
cried
Elizabeth,
as
soon
as
they
were
by
themselves.
"How
strange
this
is!
And
for
this
we
are
to
be
thankful.
That
they
should
marry,
small
as
is
their
chance
of
happiness,
and
wretched
as
is
his
character,
we
are
forced
to
rejoice.
Oh,
Lydia!"
"I
comfort
myself
with
thinking,"
replied
Jane,
"that
he
certainly
would
not
marry
Lydia
if
he
had
not
a
real
regard
for
her.
Though
our
kind
uncle
has
done
something
towards
clearing
him,
I
cannot
believe
that
ten
thousand
pounds,
or
anything
like
it,
has
been
advanced.
He
has
children
of
his
own,
and
may
have
more.
How
could
he
spare
half
ten
thousand
pounds?"
"If
he
were
ever
able
to
learn
what
Wickham's
debts
have
been,"
said
Elizabeth,
"and
how
much
is
settled
on
his
side
on
our
sister,
we
shall
exactly
know
what
Mr.
Gardiner
has
done
for
them,
because
Wickham
has
not
sixpence
of
his
own.
The
kindness
of
my
uncle
and
aunt
can
never
be
requited.
