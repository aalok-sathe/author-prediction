no
money,
what
occasion
could
there
be
for
making
love
to
a
girl
whom
he
did
not
care
about,
and
who
was
equally
poor?"
"But
there
seems
an
indelicacy
in
directing
his
attentions
towards
her
so
soon
after
this
event."
"A
man
in
distressed
circumstances
has
not
time
for
all
those
elegant
decorums
which
other
people
may
observe.
If
she
does
not
object
to
it,
why
should
we?"
"Her
not
objecting
does
not
justify
him.
It
only
shows
her
being
deficient
in
something
herself
sense
or
feeling."
"Well,"
cried
Elizabeth,
"have
it
as
you
choose.
He
shall
be
mercenary,
and
she
shall
be
foolish."
"No,
Lizzy,
that
is
what
I
do
not
choose.
I
should
be
sorry,
you
know,
to
think
ill
of
a
young
man
who
has
lived
so
long
in
Derbyshire."
"Oh!
if
that
is
all,
I
have
a
very
poor
opinion
of
young
men
who
live
in
Derbyshire;
and
their
intimate
friends
who
live
in
Hertfordshire
are
not
much
better.
I
am
sick
of
them
all.
Thank
Heaven!
I
am
going
to
morrow
where
I
shall
find
a
man
who
has
not
one
agreeable
quality,
who
has
neither
manner
nor
sense
to
recommend
him.
Stupid
men
are
