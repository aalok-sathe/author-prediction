time,
Mr.
Bingley,
it
is
very
hard
to
have
her
taken
such
a
way
from
me.
They
are
gone
down
to
Newcastle,
a
place
quite
northward,
it
seems,
and
there
they
are
to
stay
I
do
not
know
how
long.
His
regiment
is
there;
for
I
suppose
you
have
heard
of
his
leaving
the
shire,
and
of
his
being
gone
into
the
regulars.
Thank
Heaven!
he
has
some
friends,
though
perhaps
not
so
many
as
he
deserves."
Elizabeth,
who
knew
this
to
be
levelled
at
Mr.
Darcy,
was
in
such
misery
of
shame,
that
she
could
hardly
keep
her
seat.
It
drew
from
her,
however,
the
exertion
of
speaking,
which
nothing
else
had
so
effectually
done
before;
and
she
asked
Bingley
whether
he
meant
to
make
any
stay
in
the
country
at
present.
A
few
weeks,
he
believed.
"When
you
have
killed
all
your
own
birds,
Mr.
Bingley,"
said
her
mother,
"I
beg
you
will
come
here,
and
shoot
as
many
as
you
please
on
Mr.
Bennet's
manor.
I
am
sure
he
will
be
vastly
happy
to
oblige
you,
and
will
save
all
the
best
of
the
covies
for
you."
Elizabeth's
misery
increased,
at
such
unnecessary,
such
officious
attention!
