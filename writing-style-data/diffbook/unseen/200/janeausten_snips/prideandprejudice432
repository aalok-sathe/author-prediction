calls
us
home
immediately.
Conceal
the
unhappy
truth
as
long
as
it
is
possible,
I
know
it
cannot
be
long."
He
readily
assured
her
of
his
secrecy;
again
expressed
his
sorrow
for
her
distress,
wished
it
a
happier
conclusion
than
there
was
at
present
reason
to
hope,
and
leaving
his
compliments
for
her
relations,
with
only
one
serious,
parting
look,
went
away.
As
he
quitted
the
room,
Elizabeth
felt
how
improbable
it
was
that
they
should
ever
see
each
other
again
on
such
terms
of
cordiality
as
had
marked
their
several
meetings
in
Derbyshire;
and
as
she
threw
a
retrospective
glance
over
the
whole
of
their
acquaintance,
so
full
of
contradictions
and
varieties,
sighed
at
the
perverseness
of
those
feelings
which
would
now
have
promoted
its
continuance,
and
would
formerly
have
rejoiced
in
its
termination.
If
gratitude
and
esteem
are
good
foundations
of
affection,
Elizabeth's
change
of
sentiment
will
be
neither
improbable
nor
faulty.
But
if
otherwise
if
regard
springing
from
such
sources
is
unreasonable
or
unnatural,
in
comparison
of
what
is
so
often
described
as
arising
on
a
first
interview
with
its
object,
and
even
before
two
words
have
been
exchanged,
nothing
can
be
said
in
her
defence,
except
