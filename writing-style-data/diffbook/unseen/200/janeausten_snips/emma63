at
present
to
Emma,
though
I
mean
no
slight
to
the
state,
I
assure
you."
Part
of
her
meaning
was
to
conceal
some
favourite
thoughts
of
her
own
and
Mr.
Weston's
on
the
subject,
as
much
as
possible.
There
were
wishes
at
Randalls
respecting
Emma's
destiny,
but
it
was
not
desirable
to
have
them
suspected;
and
the
quiet
transition
which
Mr.
Knightley
soon
afterwards
made
to
"What
does
Weston
think
of
the
weather;
shall
we
have
rain?"
convinced
her
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
or
surmise
about
Hartfield.
Emma
could
not
feel
a
doubt
of
having
given
Harriet's
fancy
a
proper
direction
and
raised
the
gratitude
of
her
young
vanity
to
a
very
good
purpose,
for
she
found
her
decidedly
more
sensible
than
before
of
Mr.
Elton's
being
a
remarkably
handsome
man,
with
most
agreeable
manners;
and
as
she
had
no
hesitation
in
following
up
the
assurance
of
his
admiration
by
agreeable
hints,
she
was
soon
pretty
confident
of
creating
as
much
liking
on
Harriet's
side,
as
there
could
be
any
occasion
for.
She
was
quite
convinced
of
Mr.
Elton's
being
in
the
fairest
way
of
falling
in
love,
if
not
in
love
already.
She
had
no
scruple
