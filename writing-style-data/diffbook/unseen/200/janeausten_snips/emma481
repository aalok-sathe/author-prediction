could
make
her,
he
looked
at
in
silence
wanting
only
to
observe
enough
for
Isabella's
information
but
Miss
Fairfax
was
an
old
acquaintance
and
a
quiet
girl,
and
he
could
talk
to
her.
He
had
met
her
before
breakfast
as
he
was
returning
from
a
walk
with
his
little
boys,
when
it
had
been
just
beginning
to
rain.
It
was
natural
to
have
some

and

to
get
me
out.
A
walk
before
breakfast
does
me
good."
"Not
a
walk
in
the
rain,
I
should
imagine."
"No,
but
it
did
not
absolutely
rain
when
I
set
out."
Mr.
John
Knightley
smiled,
and
replied,
"That
is
to
say,
you
chose
to
have
your
walk,
