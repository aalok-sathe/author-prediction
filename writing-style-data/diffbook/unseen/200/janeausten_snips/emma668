had
promised;
but
still
Harriet
must
be
excepted.
It
was
her
superior
duty.
In
spite
of
her
vexation,
she
could
not
help
feeling
it
almost
ridiculous,
that
she
should
have
the
very
same
distressing
and
delicate
office
to
perform
by
Harriet,
which
Mrs.
Weston
had

by
look
or

whether
Harriet
could
indeed
have
received
any
hint.
"About
Jane
Fairfax.
Did
you
ever
hear
any
thing
so
