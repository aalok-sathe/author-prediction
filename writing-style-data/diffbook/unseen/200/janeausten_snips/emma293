seem
to
have
behaved
extremely
well;
and
it
is
over
and
may
never
can
never,
as
a
first
meeting,
occur
again,
and
therefore
you
need
not
think
about
it."
Harriet
said,
"very
true,"
and
she
"would
not
think
about
it;"
but
still
she
talked
of
it
still
she
could
talk
of
nothing

and
Emma,
at
last,
in
order
to
put
the
Martins
out

her
head,
was
obliged
to
hurry
on
the
news,
which

she
might
have
done
the
day
before,
or
an
hour
before,
its
interest
soon
increased;
and
before
their
first
conversation
was
over,
she
had
talked
herself
into
all
the
sensations
of
curiosity,
wonder
and
regret,
pain
and
pleasure,
as
to
this
fortunate
Miss
Hawkins,
which
could
conduce
to
place
the
Martins
under
proper
subordination
in
her
fancy.
Emma
learned
to
be
rather
glad
that
there
had
been
