to
be
acted
upon.
May
I
hope
for
the
honour
of
your
hand
for
the
two
first
dances
of
this
little
projected
ball,
to
be
given,
not
at
Randalls,
but
at
the
Crown
Inn?"
"The
Crown!"
"Yes;
if
you
and
Mr.
Woodhouse
see
no
objection,
and
I
trust
you
cannot,
my
father
hopes
his
friends
will
be
so
kind
as
to
visit
him
there.
Better
accommodations,
he
can
promise
them,
and
not
a
less
grateful
welcome
than
at
Randalls.
It
is
his
own
idea.
Mrs.
Weston
sees
no
objection
to
it,
provided
you
are
satisfied.
This
is
what
we
all
feel.
Oh!
you
were
perfectly
right!
Ten
couple,
in
either
of
the
Randalls
rooms,
would
have
been
insufferable!
Dreadful!
I
felt
how
right
you
were
the
whole
time,
but
was
too
anxious
for
securing
any
thing
to
like
to
yield.
Is
not
it
a
good
exchange?
You
consent
I
hope
you
consent?"
"It
appears
to
me
a
plan
that
nobody
can
object
to,
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
do
not.
I
think
it
admirable;
and,
as
far
as
I
can
answer
for
myself,
shall
be
most
happy
It
seems
the
only
improvement
that
could
be.
Papa,
do
you
not
think
