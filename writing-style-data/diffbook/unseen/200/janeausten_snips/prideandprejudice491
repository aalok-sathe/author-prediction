endure.
They
came.
The
family
were
assembled
in
the
breakfast
room
to
receive
them.
Smiles
decked
the
face
of
Mrs.
Bennet
as
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door;
her
husband
looked
impenetrably
grave;
her
daughters,
alarmed,
anxious,
uneasy.
Lydia's
voice
was
heard
in
the
vestibule;
the
door
was
thrown
open,
and
she
ran
into
the
room.
Her
mother
stepped
forwards,

Elizabeth
was
disgusted,
and
even
Miss
Bennet
was
shocked.
Lydia
was
Lydia
still;
untamed,
unabashed,
wild,
noisy,
and
fearless.
She
turned
from
sister
to
sister,
demanding
their
congratulations;
and
when
at
length
they
all
sat
down,
looked
eagerly
round
the
room,
took
notice
of
some
little
alteration
in
it,
and
