the
most
favourable
as
to
air."
"Ah!
my
dear,
it
is
not
like
Hartfield.
You
make
the
best
of
it
but
after
you
have
been
a
week
at
Hartfield,
you
are
all
of
you
different
creatures;
you
do
not
look
like
the
same.
Now
I
cannot
say,
that
I
think
you
are
any

you
looking

from
their
journey
and

happiness
of
coming.
I
hope
you
will
think
better
of
their
looks
to
morrow;
for
I
assure
you
Mr.
Wingfield
told
me,
that
he
did
not
believe
he
had
ever
sent
us
off
altogether,
in
such
good
case.
I
trust,
at
least,
that
you
do
not
think
Mr.
Knightley
looking
ill,"
turning
her
eyes
with
affectionate
anxiety
towards
her
husband.
"Middling,
my
dear;
I
cannot
compliment
you.
I
think
Mr.
John
Knightley
very
far
from
looking
well."
