some
time
or
other
do
me
greater
justice
than
you
can
do
now."
While
they
talked,
they
were
advancing
towards
the
carriage;
it
was
ready;
and,
before
she
could
speak
again,
he
had
handed
her
in.
He
had
misinterpreted
the
feelings
which
had
kept
her
face
averted,
and
her
tongue
motionless.
They
were
combined
only
of
anger
against
herself,
mortification,
and
deep
concern.
She
had
not
been

to
speak;
and,
on
entering

appeared
unusual
speed,
they
were
half
way
down
the
hill,
and
every
thing
left
far
behind.
She
was
vexed
beyond
what
could
have
been
expressed
almost
beyond
what
she
could
conceal.
Never
had
she
felt
so
agitated,
mortified,
grieved,
at
any
circumstance
in
her
life.
She
was
most
forcibly
struck.
The
truth
of
this
representation

was
no

She
felt
