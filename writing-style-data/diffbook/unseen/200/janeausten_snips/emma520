only
visit
from
Frank
Churchill
in
the
course
of
ten
days.
He
was
often
hoping,
intending
to
come
but
was
always
prevented.
His
aunt
could
not
bear
to
have
him
leave
her.
Such
was
his
own
account
at
Randall's.
If
he
were
quite
sincere,
if
he
really
tried
to
come,
it
was
to
be
inferred
that
Mrs.
Churchill's
removal
to
London
had
been
of
no
service
to
the
wilful
or
nervous
part
of
her
disorder.
That
she
was
really
ill
was
very
certain;
he
had
declared
himself
convinced
of
it,
at
Randalls.
Though
much
might
be
fancy,
he
could
not
doubt,
when
he
looked
back,
that
she
was
in
a
weaker
state
of
health
than
she
had
been
half
a
year
ago.
He
did
not
believe
it
to
proceed
from
any
thing
that
care
and
medicine
might
not
remove,
or
at
least
that
she
might
not
have
many
years
of
existence
before
her;
but
he
could
not
be
prevailed
on,
by
all
his
father's
doubts,
to
say
that
her
complaints
were
merely
imaginary,
or
that
she
was
as
strong
as
ever.
It
soon
appeared
that
London
was
not
the
place
for
her.
She
could
not
endure
its
noise.
