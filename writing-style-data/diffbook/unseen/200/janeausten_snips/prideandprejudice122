for
such
feelings,
and
thought
him
handsomer
than
ever
as
he
expressed
them.
"But
what,"
said
she,
after
a
pause,
"can
have
been
his
motive?
What
can
have
induced
him
to
behave
so
cruelly?"
"A
thorough,
determined
dislike
of
me
a
dislike
which
I
cannot
but
attribute
in
some
measure
to
jealousy.
Had
the
late
Mr.
Darcy
liked
me
less,
his
son
might
have
borne
with
me
better;
but
his
father's
uncommon
attachment
to
me
irritated
him,
I
believe,
very
early
in
life.
He
had
not
a
temper
to
bear
the
sort
of
competition
in
which
we
stood
the
sort
of
preference
which
was
often
given
me."
"I
had
not
thought
Mr.
Darcy
so
bad
as
this
though
I
have
never
liked
him.
I
had
not
thought
so
very
ill
of
him.
I
had
supposed
him
to
be
despising
his
fellow
creatures
in
general,
but
did
not
suspect
him
of
descending
to
such
malicious
revenge,
such
injustice,
such
inhumanity
as
this."
After
a
few
minutes'
reflection,
however,
she
continued,
"I
do
remember
his
boasting
one
day,
at
Netherfield,
of
the
implacability
of
his
resentments,
of
his
having
an
unforgiving
temper.
His
disposition
must
be
dreadful."
"I
will
not
trust
myself
