who
I
have
no
doubt
are
giving
this
ball
chiefly
to
do
me
honour
I
would
not
wish
to
be
inferior
to
others.
And
I
see
very
few
pearls
in
the
room
except
mine.
So
Frank
Churchill
is
a
capital
dancer,
I
understand.
We
shall
see
if
our
styles
suit.
A
fine
young
man
certainly

Frank

I
like
him
very
well."
At
this
moment
Frank
began
talking
so
vigorously,
that
Emma
could
not

this
moment
telling
Jane,
I
thought
you
would
begin
to
be
impatient
for
tidings
of
us."
"Jane!"
repeated
Frank
Churchill,
with
a
look
of
surprize
and
displeasure.
"That
is
easy
but
Miss
Fairfax
does
not
disapprove
it,
I
suppose."
"How
do
you
like
Mrs.
Elton?"
said
Emma
in
a
whisper.
"Not

"You
are
ungrateful."
"Ungrateful!
What
