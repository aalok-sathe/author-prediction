not
having
done
it
before.
My
total
ignorance
of
the
connection
must
plead
my
apology."
"You
are
not
going
to
introduce
yourself
to
Mr.
Darcy!"
"Indeed
I
am.
I
shall
entreat
his
pardon
for
not
having
done
it
earlier.
I
believe
him
to
be
Lady
Catherine's
nephew.
It
will
be
in
my
power
to
assure
him
that
her
ladyship
was
quite
well
yesterday
se'nnight."
Elizabeth
tried
hard
to
dissuade
him
from
such
a
scheme,
assuring
him
that
Mr.
Darcy
would
consider
his
addressing
him
without
introduction
as
an
impertinent
freedom,
rather
than
a
compliment
to
his
aunt;
that
it
was
not
in
the
least
necessary
there
should
be
any
notice
on
either
side;
and
that
if
it
were,
it
must
belong
to
Mr.
Darcy,
the
superior
in
consequence,
to
begin
the
acquaintance.
Mr.
Collins
listened
to
her
with
the
determined
air
of
following
his
own
inclination,
and,
when
she
ceased
speaking,
replied
thus:
"My
dear
Miss
Elizabeth,
I
have
the
highest
opinion
in
the
world
in
your
excellent
judgement
in
all
matters
within
the
scope
of
your
understanding;
but
permit
me
to
say,
that
there
must
be
a
wide
difference
between
the
established
forms
of
ceremony
amongst
the
laity,
and
