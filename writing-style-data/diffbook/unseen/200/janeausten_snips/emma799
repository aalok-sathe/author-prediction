me!
They
will
sometimes
obtrude
but
how
you
can
court
them!"
He
had
a
great
deal
to
say
in
return,
and
very
entertainingly;
but
Emma's
feelings
were
chiefly
with
Jane,
in
the
argument;
and
on
leaving
Randalls,
and
falling
naturally
into
a
comparison
of
the
two

uncertainty.
A
very

days
brought
the
party
from

and
she
had
no
sooner
an
opportunity
of
being
one
hour
alone
with
Harriet,
than
she
became
perfectly
satisfied
