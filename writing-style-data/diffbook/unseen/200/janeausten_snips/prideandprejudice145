suspend
any
pleasure
of
yours,"
he
coldly
replied.
She
said
no
more,
and
they
went
down
the
other
dance
and
parted
in
silence;
and
on
each
side
dissatisfied,
though
not
to
an
equal
degree,
for
in
Darcy's
breast
there
was
a
tolerably
powerful
feeling
towards
her,
which
soon
procured
her
pardon,
and
directed
all
his
anger
against
another.
They
had
not
long
separated,
when
Miss
Bingley
came
towards
her,
and
with
an
expression
of
civil
disdain
accosted
her:
"So,
Miss
Eliza,
I
hear
you
are
quite
delighted
with
George
Wickham!
Your
sister
has
been
talking
to
me
about
him,
and
asking
me
a
thousand
questions;
and
I
find
that
the
young
man
quite
forgot
to
tell
you,
among
his
other
communication,
that
he
was
the
son
of
old
Wickham,
the
late
Mr.
Darcy's
steward.
Let
me
recommend
you,
however,
as
a
friend,
not
to
give
implicit
confidence
to
all
his
assertions;
for
as
to
Mr.
Darcy's
using
him
ill,
it
is
perfectly
false;
for,
on
the
contrary,
he
has
always
been
remarkably
kind
to
him,
though
George
Wickham
has
treated
Mr.
Darcy
in
a
most
infamous
manner.
I
do
not
know
the
particulars,
but
I
know
very
well
that
Mr.
