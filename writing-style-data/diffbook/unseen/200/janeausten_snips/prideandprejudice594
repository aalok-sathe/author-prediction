his
commission!
So
much
the
better.
It
will
save
me
a
world
of
trouble
and
economy.
Had
it
been
your
uncle's
doing,
I
must
and
would
have
paid
him;
but
these
violent
young
lovers
carry
every
thing
their
own
way.
I
shall
offer
to
pay
him
to
morrow;
he
will
rant
and
storm
about
his
love
for
you,
and

weight;
and,
after
half
an
hour's
quiet
reflection
in
her
own
room,
she
was
able
to
join
the
others
with
tolerable
composure.
Every
thing
was
too
recent
for
gaiety,
but
the
evening
passed
tranquilly
away;
there
was
no
longer
anything
material
to
be
dreaded,
and
the
comfort
of
ease
and
familiarity

When
her
mother
