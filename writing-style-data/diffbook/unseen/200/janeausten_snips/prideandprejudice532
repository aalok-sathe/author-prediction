Jane,
take
care."
"My
dear
Lizzy,
you
cannot
think
me
so
weak,
as
to
be
in
danger
now?"
"I
think
you
are
in
very
great
danger
of
making
him
as
much
in
love
with
you
as
ever."
They
did
not
see
the
gentlemen
again
till
Tuesday;
and
Mrs.
Bennet,
in
the
meanwhile,
was
giving
way
to
all
the
happy
schemes,
which
the
good
humour
and
common
politeness
of
Bingley,
in
half
an
hour's
visit,
had
revived.
On
Tuesday
there
was
a
large
party
assembled
at
Longbourn;
and
the
two
who
were
most
anxiously
expected,
to
the
credit
of
their
punctuality
as
sportsmen,
were
in
very
good

When
they
repaired
to
the
dining
room,
Elizabeth
eagerly
watched
to
see
whether
Bingley
would
take
the
place,
which,
in
all
their
former
parties,
had
belonged
to
him,
by
her
sister.
Her
prudent
mother,
occupied
by
the
same
ideas,
forbore
to
invite
him
to
sit
by
herself.
On
entering
the
room,
he
seemed
to
hesitate;
but
Jane
happened
to
look
round,
and
happened
to
smile:
it
was
decided.
He
placed
himself
by
her.
Elizabeth,
with
a
triumphant
sensation,
looked
towards
his
friend.
He
bore
it
with
noble
indifference,
and
she
would
have
imagined
