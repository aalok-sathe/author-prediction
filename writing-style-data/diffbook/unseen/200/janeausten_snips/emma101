pretty
and
good
natured,
let
me
tell
you,
that
in
the
degree
she
possesses
them,
they
are
not
trivial
recommendations
to
the
world
in
general,
for
she
is,
in
fact,
a
beautiful
girl,
and
must
be
thought
so
by
ninety
nine
people
out
of
an
hundred;
and
till
it
appears
that
men
are
much
more
philosophic
on
the
subject
of
beauty
than
they
are
generally
supposed;
till
they
do
fall
in
love
with
well
informed
minds
instead
of
handsome
faces,
a
girl,
with
such
loveliness
as
Harriet,
has
a
certainty
of
being
admired
and
sought
after,
of
having
the
power
of
chusing
from
among
many,
consequently
a
claim
to
be
nice.
Her
good
nature,
too,
is
not
so
very
slight
a
claim,
comprehending,
as
it
does,
real,
thorough
sweetness
of
temper
and
manner,
a
very
humble
opinion
of
herself,
and
a
great
readiness
to
be
pleased
with
other
people.
I
am
very
much
mistaken
if
your
sex
in
general
would
not
think
such
beauty,
and
such
temper,
the
highest
claims
a
woman
could
possess."
"Upon
my
word,
Emma,
to
hear
you
abusing
the
reason
you
have,
is
almost
enough
to
make
me
think
so
too.
Better
be
without
sense,
than
