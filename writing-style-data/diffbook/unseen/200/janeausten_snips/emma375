His
admiration
was
certainly
very
warm;
yet
she
thought,
but
for
Mrs.
Weston,
it
would
not
have
struck
her.
As
a
sort
of
touchstone,
however,
she
began
to
speak
of
his
kindness
in
conveying
the
aunt
and
niece;
and
though
his
answer
was
in
the
spirit
of
cutting
the
matter
short,
she
believed
it
to
indicate
only
his
disinclination
to
dwell
on
any
kindness
of
his
own.
"I
often
feel
concern,"
said
she,
"that
I
dare
not
make
our
carriage
more
useful
on
such
occasions.
It
is
not
that
I
am
without
the
wish;
but
you
know
how
impossible
my
father
would
deem
it
that
James
should
put
to
for
such
a
purpose."
"Quite
out
of
the
question,
quite
out
of
the
question,"
he
replied;
"but
you
must
often
wish
it,
I
am
sure."
And
he
smiled
with
such
seeming
pleasure
at
the
conviction,
that
she
must
proceed
another
step.
"This
present
from
the
Campbells,"
said
she
"this
pianoforte
is
very
kindly
given."
"Yes,"
he
replied,
and
without
the
smallest
apparent
embarrassment.
"But
they
would
have
done
better
had
they
given
her
notice
of
it.
Surprizes
are
foolish
things.
The
pleasure
is
not
enhanced,
and
the
inconvenience
is
often
considerable.
