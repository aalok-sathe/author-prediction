without
you."
Emma
was
most
happy
to
be
called
to
such
a
council;
and
her
father,
engaging
to
think
it
all
over
while
she
was
gone,
the
two
young
people
set
off
together
without
delay
for
the
Crown.
There
were
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston;
delighted
to
see
her
and
receive
her
approbation,
very
busy
and
very
happy
in
their
different
way;
she,
in
some
little
distress;
and
he,
finding
every
thing
perfect.
"Emma,"
said
she,
"this
paper
is
worse
than
I
expected.
Look!
in
places
you
see
it
is
dreadfully
dirty;
and
the
wainscot
is
more
yellow
and
forlorn
than
any
thing
I
could
have
imagined."
"My
dear,
you
are
too
particular,"
said
her
husband.
"What
does
all
that
signify?
You
will
see
nothing
of
it
by
candlelight.
It
will
be
as
clean
as
Randalls
by
candlelight.
We
never
see
any
thing
of
it
on
our
club
nights."
The
ladies
here
probably
exchanged
looks
which
meant,
"Men
never
know
when
things
are
dirty
or
not;"
and
the
gentlemen
perhaps
thought
each
to
himself,
"Women
will
have
their
little
nonsenses
and
needless
cares."
One
perplexity,
however,
arose,
which
the
gentlemen
did
not
disdain.
It
regarded
a
supper
room.
At
the
time
