not
thinking
of
the
slave
trade,"
replied
Jane;
"governess
trade,
I
assure
you,
was
all
that
I
had
in
view;
widely
different
certainly
as
to
the
guilt
of
those
who
carry
it
on;
but
as
to
the
greater
misery
of
the
victims,
I
do
not
know
where
it
lies.
But
I
only
mean
to
say
that
there
are
advertising
offices,
and
that

of
life."
"You
are
very
obliging;
but
as
to
all
that,
I
am
very
indifferent;
it
would
be
no
object
to
me
to
be
with
the
rich;
my
mortifications,
I
think,
would
only
be
the
greater;
I
should
suffer
more
from
comparison.
A
gentleman's
family
is
all
that
I
should
