idea
on
the
subject,
for
the
first
start
of
its
possibility.
There
was
no
denying
that
those
brothers
had
penetration.
She
remembered
what
Mr.
Knightley
had
once
said
to
her
about
Mr.
Elton,
the
caution
he
had
given,
the
conviction
he
had
professed
that
Mr.
Elton
would
never
marry
indiscreetly;
and
blushed
to
think
how
much
truer
a
knowledge
of
his
character
had
been
there
shewn
than
any
she
had
reached
herself.
It
was
dreadfully
mortifying;
but
Mr.
Elton
was
proving
himself,
in
many
respects,
the
very
reverse
of
what
she
had
meant
and
believed
him;
proud,
assuming,
conceited;
very
full
of
his
own
claims,
and
little
concerned
about
the
feelings
of
others.
Contrary
to
the
usual
course
of
things,
Mr.
Elton's
wanting
to
pay
his
addresses
to
her
had
sunk
him
in
her
opinion.
His
professions
and
his
proposals
did
him
no
service.
She
thought
nothing
of
his
attachment,
and
was
insulted
by
his
hopes.
He
wanted
to
marry
well,
and
having
the
arrogance
to
raise
his
eyes
to
her,
pretended
to
be
in
love;
but
she
was
perfectly
easy
as
to
his
not
suffering
any
disappointment
that
need
be
cared
for.
There
had
been
no
real
affection
either
