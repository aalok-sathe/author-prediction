is,
that
they
were
seen
to
continue
the
London
road.
I
know
not
what
to
think.
After
making
every
possible
inquiry
on
that
side
London,
Colonel
F.
came
on
into
Hertfordshire,
anxiously
renewing
them
at
all
the
turnpikes,
and
at
the
inns
in
Barnet
and
Hatfield,
but
without
any
success
no
such
people
had
been
seen
to
pass
through.
With
the
kindest
concern
he
came
on
to
Longbourn,
and
broke
his
apprehensions
to
us
in
a
manner
most
creditable
to
his
heart.
I
am
sincerely
grieved
for
him
and
Mrs.
F.,
but
no
one
can
throw
any
blame
on
them.
Our
distress,
my
dear
Lizzy,
is
very
great.
My
father
and
mother
believe
the
worst,
but
I
cannot
think
so
ill
of
him.
Many
circumstances
might
make
it
more
eligible
for
them
to
be
married
privately
in
town
than
to
pursue
their
first
plan;
and
even
if
he
could
form
such
a
design
against
a
young
woman
of
Lydia's
connections,
which
is
not
likely,
can
I
suppose
her
so
lost
to
everything?
Impossible!
I
grieve
to
find,
however,
that
Colonel
F.
is
not
disposed
to
depend
upon
their
marriage;
he
shook
his
head
when
I
expressed
my
hopes,
and
said
