letter
with
ease,
cannot
write
ill."
"That
will
not
do
for
a
compliment
to
Darcy,
Caroline,"
cried
her
brother,
"because
he
does
not
write
with
ease.
He
studies
too
much
for
words
of
four
syllables.
Do
not
you,
Darcy?"
"My
style
of
writing
is
very
different
from
yours."
"Oh!"
cried
Miss
Bingley,
"Charles
writes
in
the
most
careless
way
imaginable.
He
leaves
out
half
his
words,
and
blots
the
rest."
"My
ideas
flow
so
rapidly
that
I
have
not
time
to
express
them
by
which
means
my
letters
sometimes
convey
no
ideas
at
all
to
my
correspondents."
"Your
humility,
Mr.
Bingley,"
said
Elizabeth,
"must
disarm
reproof."
"Nothing
is
more
deceitful,"
said
Darcy,
"than
the
appearance
of
humility.
It
is
often
only
carelessness
of
opinion,
and
sometimes
an
indirect
boast."
"And
which
of
the
two
do
you
call
my
little
recent
piece
of
modesty?"
"The
indirect
boast;
for
you
are
really
proud
of
your
defects
in
writing,
because
you
consider
them
as
proceeding
from
a
rapidity
of
thought
and
carelessness
of
execution,
which,
if
not
estimable,
you
think
at
least
highly
interesting.
The
power
of
doing
anything
with
quickness
is
always
prized
much
by
the
possessor,
and
often
without
any
attention
