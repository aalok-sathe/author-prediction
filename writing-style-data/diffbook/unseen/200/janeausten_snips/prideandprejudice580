in
practice,
though
not
in
principle.
As
a
child
I
was
taught
what
was
right,
but
I
was
not
taught
to
correct
my
temper.
I
was
given
good
principles,
but
left
to
follow
them
in
pride
and
conceit.
Unfortunately
an
only
son
(for
many
years
an
only
child),
I
was
spoilt
by
my
parents,
who,
though
good
themselves
(my
father,
particularly,
all
that
was
benevolent
and
amiable),
allowed,
encouraged,
almost
taught
me
to
be
selfish
and
overbearing;
to
care
for
none
beyond
my
own
family
circle;
to
think
meanly
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world;
to
wish
at
least
to
think
meanly
of
their
sense
and
worth
compared
with
my
own.
Such
I
was,
from
eight
to
eight
and
twenty;
and
such
I
might
still
have
been
but
for
you,
dearest,
loveliest
Elizabeth!
What
do
I
not
owe
you!
You
taught
me
a
lesson,
hard
indeed
at
first,
but
most
advantageous.
By
you,
I
was
properly
humbled.
I
came
to
you
without
a
doubt
of
my
reception.
You
showed
me
how
insufficient
were
all
my
pretensions
to
please
a
woman
worthy
of
being
pleased."
"Had
you
then
persuaded
yourself
that
I
should?"
"Indeed
I
had.
What
will
you
think
