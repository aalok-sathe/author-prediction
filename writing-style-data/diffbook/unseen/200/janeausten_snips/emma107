want
to
keep
Harriet
to
myself.
I
have
done
with
match
making
indeed.
I
could
never
hope
to
equal
my
own
doings
at
Randalls.
I
shall
leave
off
while
I
am
well."
"Good
morning
to
you,"
said
he,
rising
and
walking
off
abruptly.
He
was
very
much
vexed.
He
felt
the
disappointment
of
the
young
man,
and
was
mortified
to
have
been
the
means
of
promoting
it,
by
the
sanction
he
had
given;
and
the
part

She
did
not
always
feel
so

herself,
so
entirely
convinced
that
her
opinions
were
right
and
her
adversary's
wrong,
as
Mr.
Knightley.
He
walked
off
in
more
complete
self
approbation
than
he
left
for
her.
She
was
not
so
materially
cast
down,
however,
but
that
a
little
time
and
the
return
of
Harriet
were
very
adequate
restoratives.
Harriet's
staying
away
so
long
was
beginning
to
make
her
uneasy.

of
the
young
man's

to
Mrs.

Harriet
