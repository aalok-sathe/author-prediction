day
in
order
to
bring
her
some
walnuts,
because
she
had
said
how
fond
she
was
of
them,
and
in
every
thing
else
he
was
so
very
obliging.
He
had
his
shepherd's
son
into
the
parlour
one
night
on
purpose
to
sing
to
her.
She
was
very
fond
of
singing.
He
could
sing
a
little
himself.
She
believed
he
was
very
clever,
and
understood
every
thing.
He
had
a
very
fine
flock,
and,
while
she
was
with
them,
he
had
been
bid
more
for
his
wool
than
any
body
in
the
country.
She
believed
every
body
spoke
well
of
him.
His
mother
and
sisters
were
very
fond
of
him.
Mrs.
Martin
had
told
her
one
day
(and
there
was
a
blush
as
she
said
it,)
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
body
to
be
a
better
son,
and
therefore
she
was
sure,
whenever
he
married,
he
would
make
a
good
husband.
Not
that
she
wanted
him
to
marry.
She
was
in
no
hurry
at
all.
"Well
done,
Mrs.
Martin!"
thought
Emma.
"You
know
what
you
are
about."
"And
when
she
had
come
away,
Mrs.
Martin
was
so
very
kind
as
to
send
Mrs.
Goddard
a
beautiful
goose
the
finest
goose
