really
headstrong
and
foolish,
I
know
not
whether
she
would
altogether
be
a
very
desirable
wife
to
a
man
in
my
situation,
who
naturally
looks
for
happiness
in
the
marriage
state.
If
therefore
she
actually
persists
in
rejecting
my
suit,
perhaps

you

immediately;
we
are
all
in
an
uproar.
You
must
come
and
make
Lizzy
marry
Mr.
Collins,
for
she
vows
she
will
not
have

and
if
you
do
not
make
haste
he
will
change
his
mind
and
not
have
her."
