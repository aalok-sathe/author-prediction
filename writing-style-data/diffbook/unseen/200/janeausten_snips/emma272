look
around
in
walking
home,
and
lament
that
Highbury
afforded
no
young
man
worthy
of
giving
her
independence;
nobody
that
she
could
wish
to
scheme
about
for
her.
These
were
charming
feelings
but
not
lasting.
Before
she
had
committed
herself
by
any
public
profession
of
eternal
friendship
for
Jane
Fairfax,
or
done
more
towards
a
recantation
of
past
prejudices
and
errors,
than
saying
to
Mr.
Knightley,
"She
certainly
is
handsome;
she
is
better
than
handsome!"
Jane
had
spent
an
evening
at
Hartfield
with
her
grandmother
and
aunt,
and
every
thing
was
relapsing
much
into
its
usual
state.
Former
provocations
reappeared.
The
aunt
was
as
tiresome
as
ever;
more
tiresome,
because
anxiety
for
her
health
was
now
added
to
admiration
of
her
powers;
and
they
had
to
listen
to
the
description
of
exactly
how
little
bread
and
butter
she
ate
for
breakfast,
and
how
small
a
slice
of
mutton
for
dinner,
as
well
as
to
see
exhibitions
of
new
caps
and
new
workbags
for
her
mother
and
herself;
and
Jane's
offences
rose
again.
They
had
music;
Emma
was
obliged
to
play;
and
the
thanks
and
praise
which
necessarily
followed
appeared
to
her
an
affectation
of
candour,
an
air
of
greatness,
