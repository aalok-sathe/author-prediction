my
wish,"
she
continued,
"to
have
no
reserves
with
you
on
this
subject.
As
I
am
happily
quite
an
altered
creature
in
one
respect,
it
is
very
fit
that
you
should
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
it.
I
do
not
want
to
say
more
than
is
necessary
I
am
too
much
ashamed
of
having
given
way
as
I
have
done,
and
I
dare
say
you
understand
me."
"Yes,"
said
Emma,
"I
hope
I
do."
"How
I
could
so
long
a
time
be
fancying
myself!..."
cried
Harriet,
warmly.
"It
seems
like
madness!
I
can
see
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
him
now.
I
do
not
care
whether
I
meet
him
or
not
except
that
of
the
two
I
had
rather
not
see
him
and
indeed
I
would
go
any
distance
round
to
avoid
him
but
I
do
not
envy
his
wife
in
the
least;
I
neither
admire
her
nor
envy
her,
as
I
have
done:
she
is
very
charming,
I
dare
say,
and
all
that,
but
I
think
her
very
ill
tempered
and
disagreeable
I
shall
never
forget
her
look
the
other
night!
However,
I
assure
you,
Miss
Woodhouse,
I
wish
her
no
evil.
No,
let
them
be
ever
so
happy
