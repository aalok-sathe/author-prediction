less
insupportable
than
those
of
the
generality
of
travellers."
Every
object
in
the
next
day's
journey
was
new
and
interesting
to
Elizabeth;
and
her
spirits
were
in
a
state
of
enjoyment;
for
she
had
seen
her
sister
looking
so
well
as
to
banish
all
fear
for
her
health,
and
the
prospect
of
her
northern
tour
was
a
constant
source
of
delight.
When
they
left
the
high
road
for
the
lane
to
Hunsford,
every
eye
was
in
search
of
the
Parsonage,
and
every
turning
expected
to
bring
it
in
view.
The
palings
of
Rosings
Park
was
their
boundary
on
one
side.
Elizabeth
smiled
at
the
recollection
of
all
that
she
had
heard
of
its
inhabitants.
At
length
the
Parsonage
was
discernible.
The
garden
sloping
to
the
road,
the
house
standing
in
it,
the
green
pales,
and
the
laurel
hedge,
everything
declared
they
were
arriving.
Mr.
Collins
and
Charlotte
appeared
at
the
door,
and
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
small
gate
which
led
by
a
short
gravel
walk
to
the
house,
amidst
the
nods
and
smiles
of
the
whole
party.
In
a
moment
they
were
all
out
of
the
chaise,
rejoicing
at
the
sight
of
each
other.
Mrs.
Collins
welcomed
her
friend
