doubt
that
my
opinion
will
be
decidedly
in
his
favour.
I
have
heard
so
much
in
praise
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill.
At
the
same
time
it
is
fair
to
observe,
that
I
am
one
of
those
who
always
judge
for
themselves,
and
are
by
no
means
implicitly
guided
by
others.
I
give
you
notice
that
as
I
find
your
son,
so
I
shall
judge
of
him.
I
am
no
flatterer."
Mr.
Weston
was
musing.
"I
hope,"
said
he
presently,
"I
have
not
been
severe
upon
poor
Mrs.
Churchill.
If
she
is
ill
I
should
be
sorry
to
do
her
injustice;
but
there
are
some
traits
in
her
character
which
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
speak
of
her
with
the
forbearance
I
could
wish.
You
cannot
be
ignorant,
Mrs.
Elton,
of
my
connexion
with
the
family,
nor
of
the
treatment
I
have
met
with;
and,
between
ourselves,
the
whole
blame
of
it
is
to
be
laid
to
her.
She
was
the
instigator.
Frank's
mother
would
never
have
been
slighted
as
she
was
but
for
her.
Mr.
Churchill
has
pride;
but
his
pride
is
nothing
to
his
wife's:
his
is
a
quiet,
indolent,
gentlemanlike
sort
of
pride
that
would
harm
nobody,
