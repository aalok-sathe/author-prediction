would
leave
it
to
morrow,
if
I
could."
"You
are
sick
of
prosperity
and
indulgence.
Cannot
you
invent
a
few
hardships
for
yourself,
and
be
contented
to
stay?"
"I
sick
of
prosperity
and
indulgence!
You
are
quite
mistaken.
I
do
not
look
upon
myself
as
either
prosperous
or
indulged.
I
am
thwarted
in
every
thing
material.
I
do
not

myself
at

"You
are
not
quite
so
miserable,
though,
as

and

will
do

with
the
rest

"No

shall
not

I
shall
sit
by
you.
You
are
my
best
cure."
"We
are
going
to
Box
Hill
to
morrow;
you
will
join
us.
It
is
not
Swisserland,
but
it
will
be
something
for
a
young
man
so
much
in
want
of
a
change.
You
will
stay,
and
go
with
us?"
"No,
certainly
not;
I
shall
go
home
in
the
cool
of
the
evening."
"But
you
may
come
again
in
the
cool
of
to
morrow
morning."
"No
It
will
not
