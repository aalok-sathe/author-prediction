like
that
any
one
should
share
with
him
in
Isabella's
first
day.
Emma's
sense
of
right
however
had
decided
it;
and
besides
the
consideration
of
what
was
due
to
each
brother,
she
had
particular
pleasure,
from
the
circumstance
of
the
late
disagreement
between
Mr.
Knightley
and
herself,
in
procuring
him
the
proper
invitation.
She
hoped
they
might
now
become
friends
again.
She
thought
it
was
time
to
make
up.
Making
up
indeed
would
not
do.
She
certainly
had
not
been
in
the
wrong,
and
he
would
never
own
that
he
had.
Concession
must
be
out
of
the
question;
but
it
was
time
to
appear
to
forget
that
they
had
ever
quarrelled;
and
she
hoped
it
might
rather
assist
the
restoration
of
friendship,
that
when
he
came
into
the
room
she
had
one
of
the
children
with
her
the
youngest,
a
nice
little
girl
about
eight
months
old,
who
was
now
making
her
first
visit
to
Hartfield,
and
very
happy
to
be
danced
about
in
her
aunt's
arms.
It
did
assist;
for
though
he
began
with
grave
looks
and
short
questions,
he
was
soon
led
on
to
talk
of
them
all
in
the
usual
way,
and
to
take
the
child
out
