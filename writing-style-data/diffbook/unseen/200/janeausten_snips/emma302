much
thinking,
she
could
determine
on
nothing
better,
than
Harriet's
returning
the
visit;
but
in
a
way
that,
if
they
had
understanding,
should
convince
them
that
it
was
to
be
only
a
formal
acquaintance.
She
meant
to
take
her
in
the
carriage,
leave
her
at
the
Abbey
Mill,
while
she
drove
a

her
evil

her
to
the
very
spot
where,
at
that
moment,
a
trunk,
directed
to
The
Rev.
Philip
Elton,
White
Hart,
Bath,
was
to
be
seen
under
the
operation
of
being
lifted
into
the
butcher's
cart,
which
was
to
convey
it
to
