well
might
any
thing
she
could
offer
of
assistance
or
regard
be
repulsed.
An
airing
in
the
Hartfield
carriage
would
have
been
the
rack,
and
arrowroot
from
the
Hartfield
storeroom
must
have
been
poison.
She
understood
it
all;
and
as
far
as
her
mind
could
disengage
itself
from
the
injustice
and
selfishness
of
angry
feelings,
she
acknowledged
that
Jane
Fairfax
would
have
neither
elevation
nor
happiness
beyond
her
desert.
But
poor
Harriet
was
such
an
engrossing
charge!
There
was
little
sympathy
to
be
spared
for
any
body
else.
Emma
was
sadly
fearful
that
this
second
disappointment
would
be
more
severe
than
the
first.
Considering
the
very
superior
claims
of
the
object,
it
ought;
and
judging
by
its
apparently
stronger
effect
on
Harriet's
mind,
producing
reserve
and
self
command,
it
would.
She
must
communicate
the
painful
truth,
however,
and
as
soon
as
possible.
An
injunction
of
secresy
had
been
among
Mr.
Weston's
parting
words.
"For
the
present,
the
whole
affair
was
to
be
completely
a
secret.
Mr.
Churchill
had
made
a
point
of
it,
as
a
token
of
respect
to
the
wife
he
had
so
very
recently
lost;
and
every
body
admitted
it
to
be
no
more
than
due
decorum."
