between
the
houses,
he
unfolded
the
matter
to
an
audience
not
merely
wondering,
but
incredulous;
for
Mrs.
Bennet,
with
more
perseverance
than
politeness,
protested
he
must
be
entirely
mistaken;
and
Lydia,
always
unguarded
and
often
uncivil,
boisterously
exclaimed:
"Good
Lord!
Sir
William,
how
can
you
tell
such
a
story?
Do
not
you
know
that
Mr.
Collins
wants
to
marry
Lizzy?"
Nothing
less
than
the
complaisance
of
a
courtier
could
have
borne
without
anger
such
treatment;
but
Sir
William's
good
breeding
carried
him
through
it
all;
and
though
he
begged
leave
to
be
positive
as
to
the
truth
of
his
information,
he
listened
to
all
their
impertinence
with
the
most
forbearing
courtesy.
Elizabeth,
feeling
it
incumbent
on
her
to
relieve
him
from
so
unpleasant
a
situation,
now
put
herself
forward
to
confirm
his
account,
by
mentioning
her
prior
knowledge
of
it
from
Charlotte
herself;
and
endeavoured
to
put
a
stop
to
the
exclamations
of
her
mother
and
sisters
by
the
earnestness
of
her
congratulations
to
Sir
William,
in
which
she
was
readily
joined
by
Jane,
and
by
making
a
variety
of
remarks
on
the
happiness
that
might
be
expected
from
the
match,
the
excellent
character
of
Mr.
Collins,
and
the
convenient
