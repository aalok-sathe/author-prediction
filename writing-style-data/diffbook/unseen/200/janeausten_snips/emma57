wife,
but
not
at
all
for
a
governess.
But
you
were
preparing
yourself
to
be
an
excellent
wife
all
the
time
you
were
at
Hartfield.
You
might
not
give
Emma
such
a
complete
education
as
your
powers
would
seem
to
promise;
but
you
were
receiving
a
very
good
education
from
her,
on
the
very
material

point
of
submitting
your

however.
Weston
may
grow
cross
from
the
wantonness
of
comfort,
or
his
son
may
plague
him."
"I
hope
not
that.
It
is
not
likely.
No,
Mr.
Knightley,
do
not
foretell
vexation
from
that
quarter."
"Not
I,
indeed.
I
only
name
possibilities.
I
do
not
pretend
to
Emma's
genius
for
foretelling
and
guessing.
I
hope,
with
all
my
heart,
the
young
