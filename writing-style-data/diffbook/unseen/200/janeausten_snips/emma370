I
am
sure
he
does
not.
He
would
do
any
good
to
her,
or
her
family;
but
"
"Well,"
said
Mrs.
Weston,
laughing,
"perhaps
the
greatest
good
he
could
do
them,
would
be
to
give
Jane
such
a
respectable
home."
"If
it
would
be
good
to
her,
I
am
sure
it
would
be
evil
to
himself;
a
very
shameful
and
degrading
connexion.
How
would
he
bear
to
have
Miss
Bates
belonging
to
him?
To
have
her
haunting
the
Abbey,
and
thanking
him
all
day
long
for
his
great
kindness
in
marrying
Jane?
'So
very
kind
and
obliging!
But
he
always
had
been
such
a
very
kind
neighbour!'
And
then
fly
off,
through
half
a
sentence,
to
her
mother's
old
petticoat.
'Not
that
it
was
such
a
very
old
petticoat
either
for
still
it
would
last
a
great
while
and,
indeed,
she
must
thankfully
say
that
their
petticoats
were
all
very
strong.'"
"For
shame,
Emma!
Do
not
mimic
her.
You
divert
me
against
my
conscience.
And,
upon
my
word,
I
do
not
think
Mr.
Knightley
would
be
much
disturbed
by
Miss
Bates.
Little
things
do
not
irritate
him.
She
might
talk
on;
and
if
he
wanted
to
say
any
thing
himself,
