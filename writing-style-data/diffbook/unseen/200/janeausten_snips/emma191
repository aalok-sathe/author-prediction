of
Hartfield,
in
which
Mrs.
Weston
had
not
a
lively
concern;
and
half
an
hour's
uninterrupted
communication
of
all
those
little
matters
on
which
the
daily
happiness
of
private
life
depends,
was
one
of
the
first
gratifications
of
each.
This
was
a
pleasure
which
perhaps
the
whole
day's
visit
might
not
afford,
which
certainly
did
not
belong
to
the
present
half
hour;
but
the
very
sight
of
Mrs.
Weston,
her
smile,
her
touch,
her
voice
was
grateful
to
Emma,
and
she
determined
to
think
as
little
as
possible
of
Mr.
Elton's
oddities,
or
of
any
thing
else
unpleasant,
and
enjoy
all
that
was
enjoyable
to
the
utmost.
The
misfortune
of
Harriet's
cold
had
been
pretty
well
gone
through
before
her
arrival.
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
been
safely
seated
long
enough
to
give
the
history
of
it,
besides
all
the
history
of
his
own
and
Isabella's
coming,
and
of
Emma's
being
to
follow,
and
had
indeed
just
got
to
the
end
of
his
satisfaction
that
James
should
come
and
see
his
daughter,
when
the
others
appeared,
and
Mrs.
Weston,
who
had
been
almost
wholly
engrossed
by
her
attentions
to
him,
was
able
to
turn
away
and
welcome
her
dear
Emma.
