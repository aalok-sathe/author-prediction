her:
"I
dare
say
you
will
find
him
very
agreeable."
"Heaven
forbid!
That
would
be
the
greatest
misfortune
of
all!
To
find
a
man
agreeable
whom
one
is
determined
to
hate!
Do
not
wish
me
such
an
evil."
When
the
dancing
recommenced,
however,
and
Darcy
approached
to
claim
her
hand,
Charlotte
could
not
help
cautioning
her
in
a
whisper,
not
to
be
a
simpleton,
and
allow
her
fancy
for
Wickham
to
make
her
appear
unpleasant
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
ten

consequence.
Elizabeth
made
no

in
her
neighbours'
looks,
their
equal
amazement
in
beholding
it.
They
stood
for
some
time
without
speaking
a
word;
and
she
began
to
imagine
that
their
silence
was
to
last
through
the
two
dances,
and
at
first
was
resolved
not
to
break
it;
till
suddenly
fancying
that
it
would
be
the
greater
punishment
to
her
partner
to
oblige
him
to
talk,
she
made
some
slight
observation
on
the
dance.
He
replied,
and
was
again
silent.
After
a
pause
of
some
minutes,
she
addressed
him
