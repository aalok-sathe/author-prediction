We
must
not
be
nice
and
ask
for
all
the
virtues
into
the
bargain.
Cannot
you
imagine,
Mr.
Knightley,
what
a
sensation
his
coming
will
produce?
There
will
be
but
one
subject
throughout
the
parishes
of
Donwell
and
Highbury;
but
one
interest
one
object
of
curiosity;
it
will
be
all
Mr.
Frank
Churchill;
we
shall
think
and
speak
of
nobody
else."
"You
will
excuse
my
being
so
much
over
powered.
If
I
find
him
conversable,
I
shall
be
glad
of
his
acquaintance;
but
if
he
is
only
a
chattering
coxcomb,
he
will
not
occupy
much
of
my
time
or
thoughts."
"My
idea
of
him
is,
that
he
can
adapt
his
conversation
to
the
taste
of
every
body,
and
has
the
power
as
well
as
the
wish
of
being
universally
agreeable.
To
you,
he
will
talk
of
farming;
to
me,
of
drawing
or
music;
and
so
on
to
every
body,
having
that
general
information
on
all
subjects
which
will
enable
him
to
follow
the
lead,
or
take
the
lead,
just
as
propriety
may
require,
and
to
speak
extremely
well
on
each;
that
is
my
idea
of
him."
"And
mine,"
said
Mr.
Knightley
warmly,
"is,
that
if
he
turn
out
any
thing
