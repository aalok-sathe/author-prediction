walked
to
a
window.
"In
short,"
said
he,
"perhaps,
Miss
Woodhouse
I
think
you
can
hardly
be
quite
without
suspicion"
He
looked
at
her,
as
if
wanting
to
read
her
thoughts.
She
hardly
knew
what
to
say.
It
seemed
like
the
forerunner
of
something
absolutely
serious,
which
she
did
not
wish.
Forcing
herself
to
speak,
therefore,
in
the
hope
of
putting
it
by,
she
calmly
said,
"You
are
quite
in
the
right;
it
was
most
natural
to
pay
your
visit,
then"
He
was
silent.
She
believed
he
was
looking
at
her;
probably
reflecting
on
what
she
had
said,
and
trying
to
understand
the
manner.
She
heard
him
sigh.
It
was
natural
for
him
to
feel
that
he
had
cause
to
sigh.
He
could
not
believe
her
to
be
encouraging
him.
A
few
awkward
moments
passed,
and
he
sat
down
again;
and
in
a
more
determined
manner
said,
"It
was
something
to
feel
that
all
the
rest
of
my
time
might
be
given
to
Hartfield.
My
regard
for
Hartfield
is
most
warm"
He
stopt
again,
rose
again,
and
seemed
quite
embarrassed.
He
was
more
in
love
with
her
than
Emma
had
supposed;
and
who
can
say
how
it
might
have
ended,
