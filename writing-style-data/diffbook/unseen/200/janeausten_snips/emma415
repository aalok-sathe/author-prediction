ago,
when
I
had
the
measles?
'If
Miss
Taylor
undertakes
to
wrap
Miss
Emma
up,
you
need
not
have
any
fears,
sir.'
How
often
have
I
heard
you
speak
of
it
as
such
a
compliment
to
her!"
"Aye,
very
true.
Mr.
Perry
did
say
so.
I
shall
never
forget
it.
Poor
little
Emma!
You
were
very
bad
with
the
measles;
that
is,
you
would
have
been
very
bad,
but
for
Perry's
great
attention.
He
came
four
times
a
day
for
a
week.
He
said,
from
the
first,
it
was
a
very
good
sort
which
was
our
great
comfort;
but
the
measles
are
a
dreadful
complaint.
I
hope
whenever
poor
Isabella's
little
ones
have
the
measles,
she
will
send
for
Perry."
"My
father
and
Mrs.
Weston
are
at
the
Crown
at
this
moment,"
said
Frank
Churchill,
"examining
the
capabilities
of
the
house.
I
left
them
there
and
came
on
to
Hartfield,
impatient
for
your
opinion,
and
hoping
you
might
be
persuaded
to
join
them
and
give
your
advice
on
the
spot.
I
was
desired
to
say
so
from
both.
It
would
be
the
greatest
pleasure
to
them,
if
you
could
allow
me
to
attend
you
there.
They
can
do
nothing
satisfactorily
