He
wanted
her
to
look
up
and
smile;
and
having
now
brought
herself
not
to
smile
too
broadly
she
did
cheerfully
answering,
"You
need
not
be
at
any
pains
to
reconcile
me
to
the
match.
I
think
Harriet
is
doing
extremely
well.
Her
connexions
may
be
worse

his.
In

of
character,
there
can
be
no
doubt

"Upon

I
believe
you
know

as
I
do.
But,
Mr.
Knightley,

she
has
absolutely
and
downright

could
suppose
she
might
