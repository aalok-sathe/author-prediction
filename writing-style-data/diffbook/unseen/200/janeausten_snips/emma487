concurrence
of
my
lord
and
master.
You
know,
Mrs.
Weston,
you
and
I
must
be
cautious
how
we
express
ourselves.
But
I
do
flatter
myself,
my
dear
Jane,
that
my
influence
is
not
entirely
worn
out.
If
I
meet
with
no
insuperable
difficulties
therefore,
consider
that
point
as
settled."
"Excuse
me,"
said
Jane
earnestly,
"I
cannot
by
any
means
consent
to
such
an
arrangement,
so
needlessly
troublesome
to
your
servant.
If
the
errand
were
not
a
pleasure
to
me,
it
could
be
done,
as
it
always
is
when
I
am
not
here,
by
my
grandmama's."
"Oh!
my
dear;
but
so
much
as
Patty
has
to
do!
And
it
is
a
kindness
to
employ
our
men."
Jane
looked
as
if
she
did
not
mean
to
be
conquered;
but
instead
of
answering,
she
began
speaking
again
to
Mr.
John
Knightley.
"The
post
office
is
a
wonderful
establishment!"
said
she.
"The
regularity
and
despatch
of
it!
If
one
thinks
of
all
that
it
has
to
do,
and
all
that
it
does
so
well,
it
is
really
astonishing!"
"It
is
certainly
very
well
regulated."
"So
seldom
that
any
negligence
or
blunder
appears!
So
seldom
that
a
letter,
among
the
thousands
that
are
constantly
passing
