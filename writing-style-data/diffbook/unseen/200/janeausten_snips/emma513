which
is
not
a
place
to
promise
much,
you
know,
Mr.
Weston.
One
has
not
great
hopes
from
Birmingham.
I
always
say
there
is
something
direful
in
the
sound:
but
nothing
more
is
positively
known
of
the
Tupmans,
though
a
good
many
things
I
assure
you
are
suspected;
and
yet
by
their
manners
they
evidently
think
themselves
equal
even
to
my
brother,
Mr.
Suckling,
who
happens
to
be
one
of
their
nearest
neighbours.
It
is
infinitely
too
bad.
Mr.
Suckling,
who
has
been
eleven
years
a
resident
at
Maple
Grove,
and
whose
father
had
it
before
him
I
believe,
at
least
I
am
almost
sure
that
old
Mr.
Suckling
had
completed
the
purchase
before
his
death."
They
were
interrupted.
Tea
was
carrying
round,
and
Mr.
Weston,
having
said
all
that
he
wanted,
soon
took
the
opportunity
of
walking
away.
After
tea,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston,
and
Mr.
Elton
sat
down
with
Mr.
Woodhouse
to
cards.
The
remaining
five
were
left
to
their
own
powers,
and
Emma
doubted
their
getting
on
very
well;
for
Mr.
Knightley
seemed
little
disposed
for
conversation;
Mrs.
Elton
was
wanting
notice,
which
nobody
had
inclination
to
pay,
and
she
was
herself
in
a
worry
of
spirits
