from
whence
they
were
to
set
out
early
the
next
morning.
The
separation
between
her
and
her
family
was
rather
noisy
than
pathetic.
Kitty
was
the
only
one
who
shed
tears;
but
she
did
weep
from
vexation
and
envy.
Mrs.
Bennet
was
diffuse
in
her
good
wishes
for
the
felicity
of
her
daughter,
and
impressive
in
her
injunctions
that
she
should
not
miss
the
opportunity
of
enjoying
herself
as
much
as
possible
advice
which
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
would
be
well
attended
to;
and
in
the
clamorous
happiness
of
Lydia
herself
in
bidding
farewell,
the
more
gentle
adieus
of
her
sisters
were
uttered
without
being
heard.
Had
Elizabeth's
opinion
been
all
drawn

her
own
family,
she
could
not
have
formed
a
very
pleasing
opinion
of
conjugal
felicity
or
domestic
comfort.
Her
father,
captivated
by
youth
and
beauty,
and
that
appearance
of
good
humour
which
youth
and
beauty
generally
give,
had
married
a
woman
whose
weak
understanding
and
illiberal
mind
had
very
early
in
their
marriage
put
an
end
to
all
real
affection
for
her.
Respect,
esteem,
and
confidence
had
vanished
for
ever;
and
all
his
views
of
domestic
happiness
were
overthrown.
But
Mr.
Bennet
was
not
