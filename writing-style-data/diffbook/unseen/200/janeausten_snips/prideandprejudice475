and
countenance,
is
such
a
sacrifice
to
her
advantage
as
years
of
gratitude
cannot
enough
acknowledge.
By
this
time
she
is
actually
with
them!
If
such
goodness
does
not
make
her
miserable
now,
she
will
never
deserve
to
be
happy!
What
a
meeting
for
her,
when
she

"We
must
endeavour
to
forget
all
that
has
passed
on
either
side,"
said
Jane:
"I

replied
Elizabeth,
"as
neither
you,
nor
I,
nor
anybody
can
ever
forget.
It
is
useless
to
talk
of
it."
It
now
occurred
to
the
girls
that
their
mother
was
in
all
likelihood
perfectly
ignorant
of
what
had
happened.
They
went
to
the
library,
therefore,
and
asked
their
father
whether
he
would
not
wish
them
to
make

her.
He
was
writing
and,
without
