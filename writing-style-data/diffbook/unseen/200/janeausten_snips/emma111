Mr.
Knightley
might
quarrel
with
her,
but
Emma
could
not
quarrel
with
herself.
He
was
so
much
displeased,
that
it
was
longer
than
usual
before
he
came
to
Hartfield
again;
and
when
they
did
meet,
his
grave
looks
shewed

not
repent.
On

her
plans

themselves
into
as
strong
and
steady
an
attachment
as
her
youth
and
sort
of
mind
admitted.
Emma
was
soon
perfectly
satisfied
of
Mr.
Martin's
being
no
otherwise
remembered,
than
as
he
furnished
a
contrast
with
Mr.
Elton,
of
the
utmost
advantage
to
the
latter.
Her
views
of
improving
her
little
friend's
