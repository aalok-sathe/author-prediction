gaiety,
that
playfulness
of
disposition,
which,
under
any
other
circumstances,
would,
I
am
sure,
have
been
as
constantly
bewitching
to
me,
as
they
were
at
first.'
She
then
began
to
speak
of
you,
and
of
the
great
kindness
you
had
shewn
her
during
her
illness;
and
with
a
blush
which
shewed
me
how
it
was
all
connected,
desired
me,
whenever
I
had
an
opportunity,
to
thank
you
I
could
not
thank
you
too
much
for
every
wish
and

endeavour
to
do
her
good.

that
you
had
never
received
any
proper
acknowledgment
from
herself."

from
her
scrupulous

could
not
bear
these
thanks;

there

drawn
up
of
the
evil
and
the
good
I
have
done
Miss
Fairfax!
Well
(checking
herself,
and
trying
to
be
more
lively),
this
is
all
to
be
forgotten.
You
are
very
kind
to
bring
me
these
interesting
particulars.
They
shew
her
to
the
greatest
advantage.
I
am
sure
she
is
very
good
I
hope
she
will
be
very
happy.
It
