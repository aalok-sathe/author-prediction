could
take
the
note.
But
first
of
all,
there
must
be
an
answer
written
to
Mrs.
Cole."
"You
will
make
my
excuses,
my
dear,
as
civilly
as
possible.
You
will
say
that
I
am
quite
an
invalid,
and
go
no
where,
and
therefore

decline
their

You
will
get
very

when
tea
is
over."
"But
you
would
not
wish
me
to
come
away
before
I
am
tired,
papa?"
"Oh!
no,
my
love;
but
you
will
soon
be
tired.
There
will
be

people
talking

once.
You
