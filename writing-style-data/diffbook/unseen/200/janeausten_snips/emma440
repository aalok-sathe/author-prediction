to
be
done,
for
the
sake
of
what
is
more
important
than
my
comfort,
a
habit
of
self
command
in
you,
a
consideration
of
what
is
your
duty,
an
attention
to
propriety,
an
endeavour
to
avoid
the
suspicions
of
others,
to
save
your
health
and
credit,
and
restore
your
tranquillity.
These
are
the
motives
which
I
have
been
pressing
on
you.
They
are
very
important
and
sorry
I
am
that
you
cannot
feel
them
sufficiently
to
act
upon
them.
My
being
saved
from
pain
is
a
very
secondary
consideration.
I
want
you
to
save
yourself
from
greater
pain.
Perhaps
I
may
sometimes
have
felt
that
Harriet
would
not
forget
what
was
due
or
rather
what
would
be
kind
by
me."
This
appeal
to
her
affections
did
more
than
all
the
rest.
The
idea
of
wanting
gratitude
and
consideration
for
Miss
Woodhouse,
whom
she
really
loved
extremely,
made
her
wretched
for
a
while,
and
when
the
violence
of
grief
was
comforted
away,
still
remained
powerful
enough
to
prompt
to
what
was
right
and
support
her
in
it
very
tolerably.
"You,
who
have
been
the
best
friend
I
ever
had
in
my
life
Want
gratitude
to
you!
Nobody
is
equal
to
you!
