one
of
the
most
worthless
young
men
in
Great
Britain
to
be
her
husband
might
then
have
rested
in
its
proper
place.
He
was
seriously
concerned
that
a
cause
of
so
little
advantage
to
anyone
should
be
forwarded
at
the
sole
expense
of
his
brother
in
law,
and
he
was
determined,
if
possible,
to
find
out
the
extent
of
his
assistance,
and
to
discharge
the
obligation
as
soon
as
he
could.
When
first
Mr.
Bennet
had
married,
economy
was
held
to
be
perfectly
useless,
for,
of
course,
they
were
to
have
a
son.
The
son
was
to
join
in
cutting
off
the
entail,
as
soon
as
he
should
be
of
age,
and
the
widow
and
younger
children
would
by
that
means
be
provided
for.
Five
daughters
successively
entered
the
world,
but
yet
the
son
was
to
come;
and
Mrs.
Bennet,
for
many
years
after
Lydia's
birth,
had
been
certain
that
he
would.
This
event
had
at
last
been
despaired
of,
but
it
was
then
too
late
to
be
saving.
Mrs.
Bennet
had
no
turn
for
economy,
and
her
husband's
love
of
independence
had
alone
prevented
their
exceeding
their
income.
Five
thousand
pounds
was
settled
by
marriage

Mrs.
Bennet
