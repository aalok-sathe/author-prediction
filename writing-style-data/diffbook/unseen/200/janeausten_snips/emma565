and
refine
her
mind
and
it
must
be
saving
her
from
the
danger
of
degradation.
In
this
state
of
schemes,
and
hopes,
and
connivance,
June
opened
upon
Hartfield.
To
Highbury
in
general
it
brought
no
material
change.
The
Eltons
were
still
talking
of
a
visit
from
the
Sucklings,
and
of
the
use
to
be
made
of
their
barouche
landau;
and
Jane
Fairfax
was
still
at
her
grandmother's;
and
as
the
return
of
the
Campbells
from
Ireland
was
again
delayed,
and
August,
instead
of
Midsummer,
fixed
for
it,
she
was
likely
to
remain
there
full
two
months
longer,
provided
at
least
she
were
able
to
defeat
Mrs.
Elton's
activity
in
her
service,
and
save
herself
from
being
hurried
into
a
delightful
situation
against
her
will.
Mr.
Knightley,
who,
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself,
had
certainly
taken
an
early
dislike
to
Frank
Churchill,
was
only
growing
to
dislike
him
more.
He
began
to
suspect
him
of
some
double
dealing
in
his
pursuit
of
Emma.
That
Emma
was
his
object
appeared
indisputable.
Every
thing
declared
it;
his
own
attentions,
his
father's
hints,
his
mother
in
law's
guarded
silence;
it
was
all
in
unison;
words,
conduct,
discretion,
and
indiscretion,
told
the
same
