of
courtship
much
of
its
pleasure,
it
added
to
the
hope
of
the
future;
and
she
looked
forward
with
delight
to
the
time
when
they
should
be
removed
from
society
so
little
pleasing
to
either,
to
all
the
comfort
and
elegance
of
their
family
party
at
Pemberley.
Happy
for
all
her
maternal
feelings
was
the
day
on
which
Mrs.
Bennet
got
rid
of
her
two
most
deserving
daughters.
With
what
delighted
pride
she
afterwards
visited
Mrs.
Bingley,
and
talked
of
Mrs.
Darcy,
may
be
guessed.
I
wish
I
could
say,
for
the
sake
of
her
family,
that
the
accomplishment
of
her
earnest
desire
in
the
establishment
of
so
many
of
her
children
produced
so
happy
an
effect
as
to
make
her
a
sensible,
amiable,
well
informed
woman
for
the
rest
of
her
life;
though
perhaps
it
was
lucky
for
her
husband,
who
might
not
have
relished
domestic
felicity
in
so
unusual
a
form,
that
she
still
was
occasionally
nervous
and
invariably
silly.
Mr.
Bennet
missed
his
second
daughter
exceedingly;
his
affection
for
her
drew
him
oftener
from
home
than
anything
else
could
do.
He
delighted
in
going
to
Pemberley,
especially
when
he
was
least
expected.
Mr.
Bingley
and
Jane
