not
think
of
mentioning
it
to
any
body
but
you,
but
he
said
you
knew
it."
"What
did
Mr.
Weston
tell
you?"
said
Emma,
still
perplexed.
"Oh!
he
told
me
all
about
it;
that
Jane
Fairfax
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
are
to
be
married,
and
that
they
have
been
privately
engaged
to
one
another
this
long
while.
How
very
odd!"
It
was,
indeed,
so
odd;
Harriet's
behaviour
was
so
extremely
odd,
that
Emma
did
not
know
how
to
understand
it.
Her
character
appeared
absolutely
changed.
She
seemed
to
propose
shewing
no
agitation,
or
disappointment,
or
peculiar
concern
in
the
discovery.
Emma
looked
at
her,
quite
unable
to
speak.
"Had
you
any
idea,"
cried
Harriet,
"of
his
being
in
love
with
her?
You,
perhaps,
might.
You
(blushing
as
she
spoke)
who
can
see
into
every
body's
heart;
but
nobody
else
"
"Upon
my
word,"
said
Emma,
"I
begin
to
doubt
my
having
any
such
talent.
Can
you
seriously
ask
me,
Harriet,
whether
I
imagined
him
attached
to
another
woman
at
the
very
time
that
I
was
tacitly,
if
not
openly
encouraging
you
to
give
way
to
your
own
feelings?
I
never
had
the
slightest
suspicion,
till
within
the
last
hour,
of
