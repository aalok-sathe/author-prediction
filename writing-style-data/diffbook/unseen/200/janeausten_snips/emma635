lines,
containing,
upon
the
whole,
a
tolerable
account
of
Mrs.
Churchill,
and
only
wishing
him
not
to
delay
coming
back
beyond
the
next
morning
early;
but
that
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
having
resolved
to
go
home
directly,
without
waiting
at
all,
and
his
horse
seeming
to
have
got
a
cold,
Tom
had
been
sent
off
immediately
for
the
Crown
chaise,
and
the
ostler
had
stood
out
and
seen
it
pass
by,
the
boy
going
a
good
pace,
and
driving
very
steady.
There
was
nothing
in
all
this
either
to
astonish
or
interest,
and
it
caught
Emma's
attention
only
as
it
united
with
the
subject
which
already
engaged
her
mind.
The
contrast
between
Mrs.
Churchill's
importance
in
the
world,
and
Jane
Fairfax's,
struck
her;
one
was
every
thing,
the
other
nothing
and
she
sat
musing
on
the
difference
of
woman's
destiny,
and
quite
unconscious
on
what
her
eyes
were
fixed,
till
roused
by
Miss
Bates's
saying,
"Aye,
I
see
what
you
are
thinking
of,
the
pianoforte.
What
is
to
become
of
that?
Very
true.
Poor
dear
Jane
was
talking
of
it
just
now.
'You
must
go,'
said
she.
'You
and
I
must
part.
You
will
have
no
business
here.
Let
it
stay,
