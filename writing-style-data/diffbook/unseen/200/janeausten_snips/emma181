way
to
it
and
this
must
be
the
case
with
Mr.
Elton;
a
most
valuable,
amiable,
pleasing
young
man
undoubtedly,
and
very
much
in
love
with
Harriet;
but
still,
he
cannot
refuse
an
invitation,
he
must
dine
out
wherever
he
is
asked.
What
a
strange
thing
love
is!
he
can
see
ready
wit
in
Harriet,
but
will
not
dine
alone
for
her."
Soon
afterwards
Mr.
Elton
quitted
them,
and
she
could
not
but
do
him
the
justice
of
feeling
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
sentiment
in
his
manner
of
naming
Harriet
at
parting;
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
while
assuring
her
that
he
should
call
at
Mrs.
Goddard's
for
news
of
her
fair
friend,
the
last
thing
before
he
prepared
for
the
happiness
of
meeting
her
again,
when
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
give
a
better
report;
and
he
sighed
and
smiled
himself
off
in
a
way
that
left
the
balance
of
approbation
much
in
his
favour.
After
a
few
minutes
of
entire
silence
between
them,
John
Knightley
began
with
"I
never
in
my
life
saw
a
man
more
intent
on
being
agreeable
than
Mr.
Elton.
It
is
downright
labour
to
him
where
ladies
are
concerned.
