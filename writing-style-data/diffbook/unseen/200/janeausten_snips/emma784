party
was
to
be
our
brother
and
sister,
Henry,
John
and
Miss
Smith.
My
friend
Robert
could
not
resist.
They
called
for
him
in
their
way;
were
all
extremely
amused;
and
my
brother
asked
him
to
dine
with
them
the
next
day
which
he
did
and
in
the
course
of
that
visit
(as
I
understand)
he
found
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
Harriet;
and
certainly
did
not
speak
in
vain.
She
made
him,
by
her
acceptance,
as
happy
even
as
he
is
deserving.
He
came
down
by
yesterday's
coach,
and
was
with
me
this
morning
immediately
after
breakfast,
to
report
his
proceedings,
first
on
my
affairs,
and
then
on
his
own.
This
is
all
that
I
can
relate
of
the
how,
where,
and
when.
Your
friend
Harriet
will
make
a
much
longer
history
when
you
see
her.
She
will
give
you
all
the
minute
particulars,
which
only
woman's
language
can
make
interesting.
In
our
communications
we
deal
only
in
the
great.
However,
I
must
say,
that
Robert
Martin's
heart
seemed
for
him,
and
to
me,
very
overflowing;
and
that
he
did
mention,
without
its
being
much
to
the
purpose,
that
on
quitting
their
box
at
Astley's,
my
brother
