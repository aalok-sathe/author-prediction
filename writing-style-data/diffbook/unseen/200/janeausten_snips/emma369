account
for
the
horses.
He
has
a
great
regard
for
the
Bateses,
you
know,
independent
of
Jane
Fairfax
and
is
always
glad
to
shew
them
attention.
My
dear
Mrs.
Weston,
do
not
take
to
match
making.
You
do
it
very
ill.
Jane
Fairfax
mistress
of
the
Abbey!
Oh!
no,
no;
every
feeling
revolts.
For
his
own
sake,
I
would
not
have
him
do
so
mad
a
thing."
"Imprudent,
if
you
please
but
not
mad.
Excepting
inequality
of
fortune,
and
perhaps
a
little
disparity
of
age,
I
can
see
nothing
unsuitable."
"But
Mr.
Knightley
does
not
want
to
marry.
I
am
sure
he
has
not
the
least
idea
of
it.
Do
not
put
it
into
his
head.
Why
should
he
marry?
He
is
as
happy
as
possible
by
himself;
with
his
farm,
and
his
sheep,
and
his
library,
and
all
the
parish
to
manage;
and
he
is
extremely
fond
of
his
brother's
children.
He
has
no
occasion
to
marry,
either
to
fill
up
his
time
or
his
heart."
"My
dear
Emma,
as
long
as
he
thinks
so,
it
is
so;
but
if
he
really
loves
Jane
Fairfax
"
"Nonsense!
He
does
not
care
about
Jane
Fairfax.
In
the
way
of
love,
