rain.
"I
will
see
that
there
are
umbrellas,
sir,"
said
Frank
to
his
father:
"Miss
Bates
must
not
be
forgotten:"
and
away
he
went.
Mr.
Weston
was
following;
but
Mrs.
Elton
detained
him,
to
gratify
him
by
her
opinion
of
his
son;
and
so
briskly
did
she
begin,
that
the
young
man
himself,
though
by
no
means
moving
slowly,
could
hardly
be
out
of
hearing.
"A
very
fine
young
man
indeed,
Mr.
Weston.
You
know
I
candidly
told
you

a
vast
dislike
to
puppies
quite
a
horror
of
them.
They
were
never
tolerated
at
Maple
Grove.
Neither
Mr.
Suckling
nor
me
had
ever
any
patience
with
them;
and
we
used
sometimes
to
say
very
cutting
things!
Selina,
who
is
mild
almost
to
a
fault,
bore
with
them

talked

his
son,
Mr.
Weston's
attention
was
chained;
