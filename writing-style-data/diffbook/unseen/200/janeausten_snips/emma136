then
there
will
be
an
inducement,
and
I
shall
gradually
get
intimately
acquainted
with
all
the
hedges,
gates,
pools
and
pollards
of
this
part
of
Highbury."
Harriet,
she
found,
had
never
in
her
life
been
inside
the
Vicarage,
and
her
curiosity
to
see
it
was
so
extreme,
that,
considering
exteriors
and
probabilities,
Emma
could
only
class
it,
as
a
proof
of
love,
with
Mr.
Elton's
seeing
ready
wit
in
her.
"I
wish
we
could
contrive
it,"
said
she;
"but
I
cannot
think
of
any
tolerable
pretence
for
going
in;
no
servant
that
I
want
to
inquire
about
of
his
housekeeper
no
message
from
my
father."
She
pondered,
but
could
think
of
nothing.
After
a
mutual
silence
of
some
minutes,
Harriet
thus
began
again
"I
do
so
wonder,
Miss
Woodhouse,
that
you
should
not
be
married,
or
going
to
be
married!
so
charming
as
you
are!"
Emma
laughed,
and
replied,
"My
being
charming,
Harriet,
is
not
quite
enough
to
induce
me
to
marry;
I
must
find
other
people
charming
one
other
person
at
least.
And
I
am
not
only,
not
going
to
be
married,
at
present,
but
have
very
little
intention
of
ever
marrying
at
all."
"Ah!
so
you
say;
but
