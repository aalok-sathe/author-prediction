any
thing
really
good
natured,
useful,
considerate,
or
benevolent.
He
is
not
a
gallant
man,
but
he
is
a
very
humane
one;
and
this,
considering
Jane
Fairfax's
ill
health,
would
appear
a
case
of
humanity
to
him;
and
for
an
act
of
unostentatious
kindness,
there
is
nobody
whom
I
would
fix
on
more
than
on
Mr.
Knightley.
I
know
he
had
horses
to
day
for
we
arrived
together;
and
I
laughed
at
him
about
it,
but
he
said
not
a
word
that
could
betray."
"Well,"
said
Mrs.
Weston,
smiling,
"you
give
him
credit
for
more
simple,
disinterested
benevolence
in
this
instance
than
I
do;
for
while
Miss
Bates
was
speaking,
a
suspicion
darted
into
my
head,
and
I
have
never
been
able
to
get
it
out
again.
The
more
I
think
of
it,
the
more
probable
it
appears.
In
short,
I
have
made
a
match
between
Mr.
Knightley
and
Jane
Fairfax.
See
the
consequence
of
keeping
you
company!
What
do
you
say
to
it?"
"Mr.
Knightley
and
Jane
Fairfax!"
exclaimed
Emma.
"Dear
Mrs.
Weston,
how
could
you
think
of
such
a
thing?
Mr.
Knightley!
Mr.
Knightley
must
not
marry!
You
would
not
have
little
Henry
cut
out
from
Donwell?
Oh!
