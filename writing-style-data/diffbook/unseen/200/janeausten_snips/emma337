throughout
the
parishes
of
Donwell
and
Highbury,
with
great
candour;
liberal
allowances
were
made
for
the
little
excesses
of
such
a
handsome
young
man
one
who
smiled
so
often
and
bowed
so
well;
but
there
was
one
spirit
among
them
not
to
be
softened,
from
its
power
of
censure,
by
bows
or
smiles
Mr.
Knightley.
The
circumstance
was
told
him
at
Hartfield;
for
the
moment,
he
was
silent;
but
Emma
heard
him
almost
immediately
afterwards
say
to
himself,
over
a
newspaper
he
held
in
his
hand,
"Hum!
just
the
trifling,
silly
fellow
I
took
him
for."
She
had
half
a
mind
to
resent;
but
an
instant's
observation
convinced
her
that
it
was
really
said
only
to
relieve
his
own
feelings,
and
not
meant
to
provoke;
and
therefore
she
let
it
pass.
Although
in
one
instance
the
bearers
of
not
good
tidings,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston's
visit
this
morning
was
in
another
respect
particularly
opportune.
Something
occurred
while
they
were
at
Hartfield,
to
make
Emma
want
their
advice;
and,
which
was
still
more
lucky,
she
wanted
exactly
the
advice
they
gave.
This
was
the
occurrence:
The
Coles
had
been
settled
some
years
in
Highbury,
and
were
very
good
sort
of
people
