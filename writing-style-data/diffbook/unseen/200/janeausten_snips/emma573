other,
or
for
any
body
else
who
would
be
puzzled.
The
quietness
of
the
game
made
it
particularly
eligible
for
Mr.
Woodhouse,
who
had
often
been
distressed
by
the
more
animated
sort,
which
Mr.
Weston
had
occasionally
introduced,
and
who
now
sat
happily
occupied
in
lamenting,
with
tender
melancholy,
over
the
departure
of
the
"poor
little
boys,"
or
in
fondly
pointing
out,
as
he
took
up
any
stray
letter
near
him,
how
beautifully
Emma
had
written
it.
Frank
Churchill
placed
a
word
before
Miss
Fairfax.
She
gave
a
slight
glance
round
the
table,
and
applied
herself
to
it.
Frank
was
next
to
Emma,
Jane
opposite
to
them
and
Mr.
Knightley
so
placed
as
to
see
them
all;
and
it
was
his
object
to
see
as
much
as
he
could,
with
as
little
apparent
observation.
The
word
was
discovered,
and
with
a
faint
smile
pushed
away.
If
meant
to
be
immediately
mixed
with
the
others,
and
buried
from
sight,
she
should
have
looked
on
the
table
instead
of
looking
just
across,
for
it
was
not
mixed;
and
Harriet,
eager
after
every
fresh
word,
and
finding
out
none,
directly
took
it
up,
and
fell
to
work.
She
was
sitting
by
Mr.
Knightley,
