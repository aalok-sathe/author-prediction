one
only
of
the
household,
and
the
one
whom
they
could
most
trust
should
comprehend
all
her
fears
and
solicitude
on
the
subject.
In
the
dining
room
they
were
soon
joined
by
Mary
and
Kitty,
who
had
been
too
busily
engaged
in
their
separate
apartments
to
make
their
appearance
before.
One
came
from
her
books,
and
the
other
from
her
toilette.
The
faces

will
probably
be
much
talked
of.
But
we
must
stem
the
tide
of
malice,
and
pour
into
the
wounded
bosoms
of
each
other
the
balm
of
sisterly
consolation."
Then,
perceiving
in
Elizabeth
no
inclination
of
replying,
she
added,
"Unhappy
as
the
event
must
be
for
Lydia,
