remembrance,
and
prefer
him
to
every
other
man,
that
all
her
good
sense,
and
all
her
attention
to
the
feelings
of
her
friends,
were
requisite
to
check
the
indulgence
of
those
regrets
which
must
have
been
injurious
to
her
own
health
and
their
tranquillity.
"Well,
Lizzy,"
said
Mrs.
Bennet
one
day,
"what
is
your
opinion
now
of
this
sad
business
of
Jane's?
For
my
part,
I
am
determined
never
to
speak
of
it
again
to
anybody.
I
told
my
sister
Phillips
so
the
other
day.
But
I
cannot
find
out
that
Jane
saw
anything
of
him
in
London.
Well,
he
is
a
very
undeserving
young
man
and
I
do
not
suppose
there's
the
least
chance
in
the
world
of
her
ever
getting
him
now.
There
is
no
talk
of
his
coming
to
Netherfield
again
in
the
summer;
and
I
have
inquired
of
everybody,
too,
who
is
likely
to
know."
"I
do
not
believe
he
will
ever
live
at
Netherfield
any
more."
"Oh
well!
it
is
just
as
he
chooses.
Nobody
wants
him
to
come.
Though
I
shall
always
say
he
used
my
daughter
extremely
ill;
and
if
I
was
her,
I
would
not
have
put
up
with
it.
Well,
my
