be
on
good
terms
again;
though
we
can
never
be
what
we
once
were
to
each
other."
"That
is
the
most
unforgiving
speech,"
said
Elizabeth,
"that
I
ever
heard
you
utter.
Good
girl!
It
would
vex
me,
indeed,
to
see
you
again
the
dupe
of
Miss
Bingley's
pretended
regard."
"Would
you
believe
it,
Lizzy,
that
when
he
went
to
town
last
November,
he
really
loved
me,
and
nothing
but

the
most
generous
and
forgiving
heart
in
the
world,
she
knew
it
was
a
circumstance
which
must
prejudice
her
against
him.
"I
am
certainly
the
most
fortunate
creature
that
ever
existed!"
cried
Jane.
"Oh!
Lizzy,
why
am
I
thus
singled
from
my
family,
and
blessed
above
them
all!
If
I
could
but
see
you
as
happy!
If
there
