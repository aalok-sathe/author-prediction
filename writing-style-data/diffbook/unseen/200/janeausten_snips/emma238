"It
is
not
to
be
conceived
that
a
man
of
three
or
four
and
twenty
should
not
have
liberty
of
mind
or
limb
to
that
amount.
He
cannot
want
money
he
cannot
want
leisure.
We
know,
on
the
contrary,
that
he
has
so
much

both,
that
he

very

the
interior
of
a
family,
can
say
what
the
difficulties
of
any
individual

We
ought

be
acquainted
with
Enscombe,
and
