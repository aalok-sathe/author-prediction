party;
and
in
one
of
the
most
comfortable
rooms
in
the
Abbey,
especially
prepared
for
him
by
a
fire
all
the
morning,
he
was
happily
placed,
quite
at
his
ease,
ready
to
talk
with
pleasure
of
what
had
been
achieved,
and
advise
every
body
to
come
and
sit
down,
and
not
to
heat
themselves.
Mrs.
Weston,
who
seemed
to
have
walked
there
on
purpose
to
be
tired,
and
sit
all
the
time
with
him,
remained,
when
all
the
others
were
invited
or
persuaded
out,
his
patient
listener
and
sympathiser.
It
was
so
long
since
Emma
had
been
at
the
Abbey,
that
as
soon
as
she
was
satisfied
of
her
father's
comfort,
she
was
glad
to
leave
him,
and
look
around
her;
eager
to
refresh
and
correct
her
memory
with
more
particular
observation,
more
exact
understanding
of
a
house
and
grounds
which
must
ever
be
so
interesting
to
her
and
all
her
family.
She
felt
all
the
honest
pride
and
complacency
which
her
alliance
with
the
present
and
future
proprietor
could
fairly
warrant,
as
she
viewed
the
respectable
size
and
style
of
the
building,
its
suitable,
becoming,
characteristic
situation,
low
and
sheltered
its
ample
gardens
stretching
down
to
meadows
