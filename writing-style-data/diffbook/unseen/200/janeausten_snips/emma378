he
was
still
talking
to
Mrs.
Cole.
Emma
had
no
longer
an
alarm
for
Henry;
his
interest
was
yet
safe;
and
she
led
off
the
dance
with
genuine
spirit
and
enjoyment.
Not
more
than
five
couple
could
be
mustered;
but
the
rarity
and
the
suddenness
of
it
made
it
very
delightful,
and
she
found
herself
well
matched
in
a
partner.
They
were
a
couple
worth
looking
at.
Two
dances,
unfortunately,
were
all
that
could
be
allowed.
It
was
growing
late,
and
Miss
Bates
became
anxious
to
get
home,
on
her
mother's
account.
After
some
attempts,
therefore,
to
be
permitted
to
begin
again,
they
were
obliged
to
thank
Mrs.
Weston,
look
sorrowful,
and
have
done.
"Perhaps
it
is
as
well,"
said
Frank
Churchill,
as
he
attended
Emma
to
her
carriage.
"I
must
have
asked
Miss
Fairfax,
and
her
languid
dancing
would
not
have
agreed
with
me,
after
yours."
Emma
did
not
repent
her
condescension
in
going
to
the
Coles.
The
visit
afforded
her
many
pleasant
recollections
the
next
day;
and
all
that
she
might
be
supposed
to
have
lost
on
the
side
of
dignified
seclusion,
must
be
amply
repaid
in
the
splendour
of
popularity.
She
must
have
delighted
the
Coles
worthy
