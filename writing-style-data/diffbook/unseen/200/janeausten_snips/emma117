to
break
off
from
these
very
pleasant
observations,
which
were
otherwise
of
a
sort
to
run
into
great
length,
by
the
eagerness
of
Harriet's
wondering
questions.
"What
can
it
be,
Miss
Woodhouse?
what
can
it
be?
I
have
not
an
idea
I
cannot
guess
it
in
the
least.
What
can
it
possibly
be?
Do
try
to
find
it
out,
Miss
Woodhouse.
Do
help
me.
I
never
saw
any
thing
so
hard.
Is
it
kingdom?
I
wonder
who
the
friend
was
and
who
could
be
the
young
lady.
Do
you
think
it
is
a
good
one?
Can
it
be
woman?
And
woman,
lovely
woman,
reigns
alone.
Can
it
be
Neptune?
Behold
him
there,
the
monarch
of
the
seas!
Or
a
trident?
or
a
mermaid?
or
a
shark?
Oh,
no!
shark
is
only
one
syllable.
It
must
be
very
clever,
or
he
would
not
have
brought
it.
Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
do
you
think
we
shall
ever
find
it
out?"
"Mermaids
and
sharks!
Nonsense!
My
dear
Harriet,
what
are
you
thinking
of?
Where
would
be
the
use
of
his
bringing
us
a
charade
made
by
a
friend
upon
a
mermaid
or
a
shark?
Give
me
the
paper
and
listen.
For
Miss
