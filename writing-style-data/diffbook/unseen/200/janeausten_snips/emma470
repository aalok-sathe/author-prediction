condemn
her
taste
for
what
she
goes
to."
"You
are
right,
Mrs.
Weston,"
said
Mr.
Knightley
warmly,
"Miss
Fairfax
is
as
capable
as
any
of
us
of
forming
a
just
opinion
of
Mrs.
Elton.
Could
she
have
chosen
with
whom
to
associate,
she
would
not
have
chosen
her.
But
(with
a
reproachful
smile
at
Emma)
she
receives
attentions
from
Mrs.
Elton,
which
nobody
else
pays
her."
Emma
felt
that
Mrs.
Weston
was
giving
her
a
momentary
glance;
and
she
was
herself
struck
by
his
warmth.
With
a
faint
blush,
she
presently
replied,
"Such

"I
should
not
wonder,"
said
Mrs.
Weston,
"if
Miss
Fairfax
were
to
have
been
drawn
on
beyond
her
own
inclination,
by
her
aunt's
eagerness
in
accepting
Mrs.
Elton's
civilities
for
her.
Poor
Miss
Bates
may
very
likely
have
committed
her
niece
and
hurried
her
into
a
greater
appearance
of
intimacy
than
her
own
good
sense
would
have
dictated,
in
spite
of
the
very
natural
wish
of
a
little
change."
Both
felt
rather
anxious
to
hear
him
speak
again;
and
after
