pointedly
excluded.
She
had
not
even
a
share
in
his
opening
compliments.
Her
name
was
not
mentioned;
and
there
was
so
striking
a
change
in
all
this,
and
such
an
ill
judged
solemnity
of
leave
taking
in
his
graceful
acknowledgments,
as
she
thought,
at
first,
could
not
escape
her
father's
suspicion.
It
did,
however.
Her
father
was
quite
taken
up
with
the
surprize

so
sudden
a
journey,

his
fears
that
Mr.

now
resolved
to
keep
Harriet
no
longer
in
the
dark.
She
had
reason
to
believe
her
nearly
recovered
from
her
cold,
and
it
was
desirable
that
she
should
have
as
much
time
as
possible
for
getting
the
better

her
other
complaint
before
the
gentleman's
return.
She
