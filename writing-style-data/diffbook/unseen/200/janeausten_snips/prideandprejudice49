symptoms
increased,
and
her
head
ached
acutely.
Elizabeth
did
not
quit
her
room
for
a
moment;
nor
were
the
other
ladies
often
absent;
the
gentlemen
being
out,
they
had,
in
fact,
nothing
to
do
elsewhere.
When
the
clock
struck
three,
Elizabeth
felt
that
she
must
go,
and
very
unwillingly
said
so.
Miss
Bingley
offered
her
the
carriage,
and
she
only
wanted
a
little
pressing
to
accept
it,
when
Jane
testified
such
concern
in
parting
with
her,
that
Miss
Bingley
was
obliged
to
convert
the
offer
of
the
chaise
to
an
invitation
to
remain
at
Netherfield
for
the
present.
Elizabeth
most
thankfully
consented,
and
a
servant
was
dispatched
to
Longbourn
to
acquaint
the
family
with
her
stay
and
bring
back
a
supply
of
clothes.
At
five

the
two
ladies
retired
to
dress,
and
at
half
past
six
Elizabeth
was
summoned
to
dinner.
To
the
civil
inquiries
which
then
poured
in,
and
amongst
which
she
had
the
pleasure
of
distinguishing
the
much
superior
solicitude
of
Mr.
Bingley's,
she
could
not
make
a
very
favourable
answer.
Jane
was
by
no
means
better.
The
sisters,
on
hearing
this,
repeated
three
or
four
times
how
much
they
were
grieved,
how
shocking
it
was
to
