temper.
Those
who
can
barely
live,
and
who
live
perforce
in
a
very
small,
and
generally
very
inferior,
society,
may
well
be
illiberal
and
cross.
This
does
not
apply,
however,
to
Miss
Bates;
she
is
only
too
good
natured
and
too
silly
to
suit
me;
but,
in
general,
she
is
very
much
to
the
taste
of
every
body,
though
single
and
though
poor.
Poverty
certainly
has
not
contracted
her
mind:
I
really
believe,
if
she
had
only
a
shilling
in
the
world,
she
would
be
very
likely
to
give
away
sixpence
of
it;
and
nobody
is
afraid
of
her:
that
is
a
great
charm."
"Dear
me!
but
what
shall
you
do?
how
shall
you
employ
yourself
when
you
grow
old?"
"If
I
know
myself,
Harriet,
mine
is
an
active,
busy
mind,
with
a
great
many
independent
resources;
and
I
do
not
perceive
why
I
should
be
more
in
want
of
employment
at
forty
or
fifty
than
one
and
twenty.
Woman's
usual
occupations
of
hand
and
mind
will
be
as
open
to
me
then
as
they
are
now;
or
with
no
important
variation.
If
I
draw
less,
I
shall
read
more;
if
I
give
up
music,
I
shall
take
to
carpet
