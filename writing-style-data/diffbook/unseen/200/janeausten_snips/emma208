at
Randalls,
while
her
children
were
at
Hartfield,
was
full
in
her
imagination;
and
fancying
the
road
to
be
now
just
passable
for
adventurous
people,
but
in
a
state
that
admitted
no
delay,
she
was
eager
to
have
it
settled,
that
her
father
and
Emma
should
remain
at
Randalls,
while
she
and
her
husband
set
forward
instantly
through
all
the
possible
accumulations
of
drifted
snow
that
might
impede
them.
"You
had
better
order
the
carriage
directly,
my
love,"
said
she;
"I
dare
say
we
shall
be
able
to
get
along,
if
we
set
off
directly;
and
if
we
do
come
to
any
thing
very
bad,
I
can
get
out
and
walk.
I
am
not
at
all
afraid.
I
should
not
mind
walking
half
the
way.
I
could
change
my
shoes,
you
know,
the
moment
I
got
home;
and
it
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
gives
me
cold."
"Indeed!"
replied
he.
"Then,
my
dear
Isabella,
it
is
the
most
extraordinary
sort
of
thing
in
the
world,
for
in
general
every
thing
does
give
you
cold.
Walk
home!
you
are
prettily
shod
for
walking
home,
I
dare
say.
It
will
be
bad
enough
for
the
horses."
Isabella
turned
to
Mrs.
