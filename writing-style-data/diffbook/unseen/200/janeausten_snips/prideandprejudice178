nervous
complaints
can
have
no
great
inclination
for
talking.
Nobody
can
tell
what
I
suffer!
But
it
is
always
so.
Those
who
do
not
complain
are
never
pitied."
Her
daughters
listened
in
silence
to
this
effusion,
sensible
that
any
attempt
to
reason
with
her
or
soothe
her
would
only
increase
the
irritation.
She

therefore,
without

by
the
civility
of
Mr.
Collins,
whose
inquiries
after
herself
and
all
her
family
were
very
minute,
and
then
by
a
little
curiosity,
satisfied
herself
with
walking
to
the
window
and
pretending
not
to
hear.
In
a
doleful
voice
Mrs.
Bennet
began
the
projected
conversation:
"Oh!
