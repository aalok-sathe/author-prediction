engaged
one
day
as
she
walked,
in
perusing
Jane's
last
letter,
and
dwelling
on
some
passages
which
proved
that
Jane
had
not
written
in
spirits,
when,
instead
of
being
again
surprised
by
Mr.
Darcy,
she
saw
on
looking
up
that
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
was
meeting
her.
Putting
away
the
letter
immediately
and
forcing
a
smile,
she
said:
"I
did
not
know
before
that
you
ever
walked
this
way."
"I
have
been
making
the
tour
of
the
park,"
he
replied,
"as
I
generally
do
every
year,
and
intend
to
close
it
with
a
call
at
the
Parsonage.
Are
you
going
much
farther?"
"No,
I
should
have
turned
in
a
moment."
And
accordingly
she
did
turn,
and
they
walked
towards
the
Parsonage
together.
"Do
you
certainly
leave
Kent
on
Saturday?"
said
she.
"Yes
if
Darcy
does
not
put
it
off
again.
But
I
am
at
his
disposal.
He
arranges
the
business
just
as
he
pleases."
"And
if
not
able
to
please
himself
in
the
arrangement,
he
has
at
least
pleasure
in
the
great
power
of
choice.
I
do
not
know
anybody
who
seems
more
to
enjoy
the
power
of
doing
what
he
likes
than
Mr.
Darcy."
"He
likes
to
have
his
own
way
