plan
and
she
gradually
learned
to
consider
it
herself
with
greater
pleasure
as
well
as
greater
certainty.
Absence
had
increased
her
desire
of
seeing
Charlotte
again,
and
weakened
her
disgust
of
Mr.
Collins.
There
was
novelty
in
the
scheme,
and
as,
with
such
a
mother
and
such
uncompanionable
sisters,
home
could
not
be
faultless,
a
little
change
was
not
unwelcome
for
its
own
sake.
The
journey
would
moreover
give
her
a
peep
at
Jane;
and,
in
short,
as
the
time
drew
near,
she
would
have
been
very
sorry
for
any
delay.
Everything,
however,
went
on
smoothly,
and
was
finally
settled
according
to
Charlotte's
first
sketch.
She
was
to
accompany
Sir
William
and
his
second
daughter.
The
improvement
of
spending
a
night
in
London
was
added
in
time,
and
the
plan
became
perfect
as
plan
could
be.
The
only
pain
was
in
leaving
her
father,
who
would
certainly
miss
her,
and
who,
when
it
came
to
the
point,
so
little
liked
her
going,
that
he
told
her
to
write
to
him,
and
almost
promised
to
answer
her
letter.
The
farewell
between
herself
and
Mr.
Wickham
was
perfectly
friendly;
on
his
side
even
more.
His
present
pursuit
could
not
make
him
forget
