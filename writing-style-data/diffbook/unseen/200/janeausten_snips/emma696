fit
that
the
fortune
should
be
on
his
side,
for
I
think
the
merit
will
be
all
on
hers."
Such
a
conclusion
could
not
pass
unanswered
by
Mrs.
Weston.
She
thought
well
of
Frank
in
almost
every
respect;
and,
what
was
more,
she
loved
him
very
much,
and
her
defence
was,
therefore,
earnest.
She
talked
with
a
great
deal
of
reason,
and
at
least
equal
affection
but
she
had
too
much
to
urge
for
Emma's
attention;
it
was
soon
gone
to
Brunswick
Square
or
to
Donwell;
she
forgot
to
attempt
to
listen;
and
when
Mrs.
Weston
ended
with,
"We
have
not
yet
had
the
letter
we
are
so
anxious
for,
you
know,
but
I
hope
it
will
soon
come,"
she
was
obliged
to
pause
before
she
answered,
and
at
last
obliged
to
answer
at
random,
before
she
could
at
all
recollect
what
letter
it
was
which
they
were
so
anxious
for.
"Are
you
well,
my
Emma?"
was
Mrs.
Weston's
parting
question.
"Oh!
perfectly.
I
am
always
well,
you
know.
Be
sure
to
give
me
intelligence
of
the
letter
as
soon
as
possible."
Mrs.
Weston's
communications
furnished
Emma
with
more
food
for
unpleasant
reflection,
by
increasing
her
esteem
and
compassion,
and
