to
her
own.
With
mixed
feelings,
she
seated
herself
at
a
little
distance
from
the
numbers
round
the
instrument,
to
listen.
Frank
Churchill
sang
again.
They
had
sung
together
once
or
twice,
it
appeared,
at
Weymouth.
But
the
sight
of
Mr.
Knightley
among
the
most
attentive,
soon
drew
away
half
Emma's
mind;
and
she
fell
into
a
train
of
thinking
on
the
subject
of
Mrs.
Weston's
suspicions,
to
which
the
sweet
sounds
of
the
united
voices
gave
only
momentary
interruptions.
Her
objections
to
Mr.
Knightley's
marrying
did
not
in
the
least
subside.
She
could
see
nothing
but
evil
in
it.
It
would
be
a
great
disappointment
to
Mr.
John
Knightley;
consequently
to
Isabella.
A
real
injury
to
the
children
a
most
mortifying
change,
and
material
loss
to
them
all;
a
very
great
deduction
from
her
father's
daily
comfort
and,
as
to
herself,
she
could
not
at
all
endure
the
idea
of
Jane
Fairfax
at
Donwell
Abbey.
A
Mrs.
Knightley
for
them
all
to
give
way
to!
No
Mr.
Knightley
must
never
marry.
Little
Henry
must
remain
the
heir
of
Donwell.
Presently
Mr.
Knightley
looked
back,
and
came
and
sat
down
by
her.
They
talked
at
first
only
of
the
performance.
