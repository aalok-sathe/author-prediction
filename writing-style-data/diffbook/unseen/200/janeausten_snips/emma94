very
well
judging.
He
told
me
every
thing;
his
circumstances
and
plans,
and
what
they
all
proposed
doing
in
the
event
of
his
marriage.
He
is
an
excellent
young
man,
both
as
son
and
brother.
I
had
no
hesitation
in
advising
him
to
marry.
He
proved
to
me
that
he
could
afford
it;
and
that
being
the
case,
I
was
convinced
he
could
not
do
better.
I
praised
the
fair
lady
too,
and
altogether
sent
him

If
he
had

may
fairly
suppose,
he
would
not

before
he
spoke
to
the
lady,
and
as
he
does
not
appear
to
have
spoken
yesterday,
it
is
not
unlikely
that
he
should
be
at
Mrs.
Goddard's
to
day;
and
she
may
be
detained
by
a
visitor,
without
thinking
him
at
all
a
tiresome
wretch."
"Pray,
Mr.
Knightley,"
said
Emma,
who
had
been
smiling
to
herself
through
a
great
part
of
this
speech,
"how
