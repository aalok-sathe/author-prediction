ever
read,
I
am
convinced
that
it
is
very
common
indeed;
that
human
nature
is
particularly
prone
to
it,
and
that
there
are
very
few
of
us
who
do
not
cherish
a
feeling
of
self
complacency
on
the
score
of
some
quality
or
other,
real
or
imaginary.
Vanity
and
pride
are
different
things,
though
the
words
are
often
used
synonymously.
A
person
may
be
proud
without
being
vain.
Pride
relates
more
to
our
opinion
of
ourselves,
vanity
to
what
we
would
have
others
think
of
us."
"If
I
were
as
rich
as
Mr.
Darcy,"
cried
a
young
Lucas,
who
came
with
his
sisters,
"I
should
not
care
how
proud
I
was.
I
would
keep
a
pack
of
foxhounds,
and
drink
a
bottle
of
wine
a
day."
"Then
you
would
drink
a
great
deal
more
than
you
ought,"
said
Mrs.
Bennet;
"and
if
I
were
to
see
you
at
it,
I
should
take
away
your
bottle
directly."
The
boy
protested
that
she
should
not;
she
continued
to
declare
that
she
would,
and
the
argument
ended
only
with
the
visit.
The
ladies
of
Longbourn
soon
waited
on
those
of
Netherfield.
The
visit
was
soon
returned
in
due
form.
