so
quick,
from
the
accidental
rencontre,
to
the
dinner
at
Mr.
Green's,
and
the
party
at
Mrs.
Brown's
smiles
and
blushes
rising
in
importance
with
consciousness
and
agitation
richly
scattered
the
lady
had
been
so
easily
impressed
so
sweetly
disposed
had
in
short,
to
use
a
most
intelligible
phrase,
been
so
very
ready
to
have
him,
that
vanity
and
prudence
were
equally
contented.
He
had
caught
both
substance
and
shadow
both
fortune
and
affection,
and
was
just
the
happy
man
he
ought
to
be;
talking
only
of
himself
and
his
own
concerns
expecting
to
be
congratulated
ready
to
be
laughed
at
and,
with
cordial,
fearless
smiles,
now
addressing
all
the
young
ladies
of
the
place,
to
whom,
a
few
weeks
ago,
he
would
have
been
more
cautiously
gallant.
The
wedding
was
no
distant
event,
as
the
parties
had
only
themselves
to
please,
and
nothing
but
the
necessary
preparations
to
wait
for;
and
when
he
set
out
for
Bath
again,
there
was
a
general
expectation,
which
a
certain
glance
of
Mrs.
Cole's
did
not
seem
to
contradict,
that
when
he
next
entered
Highbury
he
would
bring
his
bride.
During
his
present
short
stay,
Emma
had
barely
seen
him;
but
just
enough
