their
whims.
Respect
for
right
conduct
is
felt
by
every
body.
If
he
would
act
in
this
sort
of
manner,
on
principle,
consistently,
regularly,
their
little
minds
would
bend
to
his."
"I
rather
doubt
that.
You
are
very
fond
of
bending
little
minds;
but
where
little
minds
belong
to
rich
people
in
authority,
I
think
they
have
a
knack
of
swelling
out,
till
they
are
quite
as
unmanageable
as
great
ones.
I
can
imagine,
that
if
you,
as
you
are,
Mr.
Knightley,
were
to
be
transported
and
placed
all
at
once
in
Mr.
Frank
Churchill's
situation,
you
would
be
able
to
say
and
do
just
what
you
have
been
recommending
for
him;
and
it
might
have
a
very
good
effect.
The
Churchills
might
not
have
a
word
to
say
in
return;
but
then,
you
would
have
no
habits
of
early
obedience
and
long
observance
to
break
through.
To
him
who
has,
it
might
not
be
so
easy
to
burst
forth
at
once
into
perfect
independence,
and
set
all
their
claims
on
his
gratitude
and
regard
at
nought.
He
may
have
as
strong
a
sense
of
what
would
be
right,
as
you
can
have,
without
being
so
equal,
under
particular
circumstances,
