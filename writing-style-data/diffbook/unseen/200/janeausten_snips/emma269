not
quite
acquit
her.
But
"she
could
never
get
acquainted
with
her:
she
did
not
know
how
it
was,
but
there
was
such
coldness
and
reserve
such
apparent
indifference
whether
she
pleased
or
not
and
then,
her
aunt
was
such
an
eternal
talker!
and
she
was
made
such
a
fuss

by
every

and
now,
when
the
due
visit
was
paid,
on
her
arrival,
after
a
two
years'
interval,
she
was
particularly
struck
with
the
very
appearance
and
manners,
which
for
those
two
whole
years
she
had
been
depreciating.
Jane
Fairfax
was
very
elegant,
remarkably
elegant;
and
she
had
herself
the
highest
value
for
elegance.
Her
height
was
pretty,
just
such
as
almost
every
body
would
think

and
nobody
could
think
very
