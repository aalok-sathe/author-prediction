if
things
are
going
untowardly
one
month,
they
are
sure
to
mend
the
next."
"Very
true,
Mr.
Weston,
perfectly
true.
It
is
just
what
I
used
to
say
to
a
certain
gentleman
in
company
in
the
days
of
courtship,
when,
because
things
did
not

dispel
those
gloomy
ideas
and

him
cheerfuller
views!

quite
in
despair."

of
going
on.
"You
were
mentioning
May.
May
is
the
very
month
which
Mrs.
Churchill
is
ordered,
or
has
ordered
herself,
to
spend
in
some
warmer
place
than
Enscombe
in
short,
to
spend
in
London;
so
that
we
have
the
agreeable
prospect
of
frequent
visits
from
Frank

whole
spring

season

the
year
