have
stopped,
and
left
the
rest
to
time
and
chance.
I
was
introducing
her
into
good
company,
and
giving
her
the
opportunity
of
pleasing
some
one
worth
having;
I
ought
not
to
have
attempted
more.
But
now,
poor
girl,
her
peace
is
cut
up
for
some
time.
I
have
been
but
half
a
friend
to
her;
and
if
she
were
not
to
feel
this
disappointment
so
very
much,
I
am
sure
I
have
not
an
idea
of
any
body
else
who
would
be
at
all
desirable
for
her;
William
Coxe
Oh!
no,
I
could
not
endure
William
Coxe
a
pert
young
lawyer."
She
stopt
to
blush
and
laugh
at
her
own
relapse,
and
then
resumed
a
more
serious,
more
dispiriting
cogitation
upon
what
had
been,
and
might
be,
and
must
be.
The
distressing
explanation
she
had
to
make
to
Harriet,
and
all
that
poor
Harriet
would
be
suffering,
with
the
awkwardness
of
future
meetings,
the
difficulties
of
continuing
or
discontinuing
the
acquaintance,
of
subduing
feelings,
concealing
resentment,
and
avoiding
eclat,
were
enough
to
occupy
her
in
most
unmirthful
reflections
some
time
longer,
and
she
went
to
bed
at
last
with
nothing
settled
but
the
conviction
of
her
having
blundered
most
