second
time,
therefore,
was
very
odd!
Yet
it
did,
and
even
a
third.
It
seemed
like
wilful
ill
nature,
or
a
voluntary
penance,
for
on
these
occasions
it
was
not
merely
a
few
formal
inquiries
and
an
awkward
pause
and
then
away,
but
he
actually
thought
it
necessary
to
turn
back
and
walk
with
her.
He
never
said
a
great
deal,
nor
did
she
give
herself
the
trouble

to
expect
that
whenever
she
came
into
Kent
again
she
would
be
staying
there
too.
His
words
seemed
to
imply
it.
Could
he
have
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
in
his
thoughts?
She
supposed,
if
he
meant
anything,
he
must
mean
an
allusion
to
what
might
arise
in
that
quarter.
It
distressed
her
a
little,
and
she
was
quite
glad
to
find
herself
at
the
gate

the
pales
opposite

Parsonage.
She
