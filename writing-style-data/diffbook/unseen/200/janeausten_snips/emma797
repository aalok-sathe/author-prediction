this
meeting
for
the
world.
I
should
certainly
have
called
at
Hartfield,
had
you
failed
to
come."
The
others
had
been
talking
of
the
child,
Mrs.
Weston
giving
an
account
of
a
little
alarm
she
had
been
under,
the
evening
before,
from
the
infant's
appearing
not
quite
well.
She
believed
she
had
been
foolish,
but
it
had
alarmed
her,
and
she
had
been
within
half
a
minute
of
sending
for
Mr.
Perry.
Perhaps
she
ought
to
be
ashamed,
but
Mr.
Weston
had
been
almost
as
uneasy
as
herself.
In
ten
minutes,
however,
the
child
had
been
perfectly
well
again.
This
was
her
history;
and
particularly
interesting
it
was
to
Mr.
Woodhouse,
who
commended
her
very
much
for
thinking
of
sending
for
Perry,
and
only
regretted
that
she
had
not
done
it.
"She
should
always
send
for
Perry,
if
the
child
appeared
in
the
slightest
degree
disordered,
were
it
only
for
a
moment.
She
could
not
be
too
soon
alarmed,
nor
send
for
Perry
too
often.
It
was
a
pity,
perhaps,
that
he
had
not
come
last
night;
for,
though
the
child
seemed
well
now,
very
well
considering,
it
would
probably
have
been
better
if
Perry
had
seen
it."
