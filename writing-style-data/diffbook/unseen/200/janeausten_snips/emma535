led
the
way,
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss
Woodhouse
followed.
Emma
must
submit
to
stand
second
to
Mrs.
Elton,
though
she
had
always
considered
the
ball
as
peculiarly
for
her.
It
was
almost
enough
to
make
her
think
of
marrying.
Mrs.
Elton
had
undoubtedly
the
advantage,
at
this
time,
in
vanity
completely
gratified;
for
though
she
had
intended
to
begin
with
Frank
Churchill,
she
could
not
lose

the
change.
Mr.
Weston
might
be
his
son's
superior.
In
spite
of
this
little
rub,
however,
Emma
was
smiling
with
enjoyment,

Knightley's
not
dancing
than
by
any
thing
else.
There
he
was,
among
the
standers
by,
where
he
ought
not
to
be;
he
ought
to
be
dancing,
not
classing
himself
with
the
husbands,
and
fathers,
and
whist
players,
who
were
pretending
to
feel
an
interest
in
the
dance
till
their
rubbers
were
made
up,
so
young
as
he
looked!
He
could
not
have
appeared
to
greater
advantage
perhaps
anywhere,
than
where
he
had
placed
himself.
