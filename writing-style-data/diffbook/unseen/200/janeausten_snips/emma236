as
warmly
into
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston's
disappointment,
as
might
naturally
belong
to
their
friendship.
She
was
the
first
to
announce
it
to
Mr.
Knightley;
and
exclaimed
quite
as
much
as
was
necessary,
(or,
being
acting
a
part,
perhaps
rather
more,)
at
the
conduct
of
the
Churchills,
in
keeping
him
away.
She
then
proceeded
to
say
a
good
deal
more
than
she
felt,
of
the
advantage
of
such
an
addition
to
their
confined
society
in
Surry;
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
somebody
new;
the
gala
day
to
Highbury
entire,
which
the
sight
of
him
would
have
made;
and
ending
with
reflections
on
the
Churchills
again,
found
herself
directly
involved
in
a
disagreement
with
Mr.
Knightley;
and,
to
her
great
amusement,
perceived
that
she
was
taking
the
other
side
of
the
question
from
her
real
opinion,
and
making
use
of
Mrs.
Weston's
arguments
against
herself.
"The
Churchills
are
very
likely
in
fault,"
said
Mr.
Knightley,
coolly;
"but
I
dare
say
he
might
come
if
he
would."
"I
do
not
know
why
you
should
say
so.
He
wishes
exceedingly
to
come;
but
his
uncle
and
aunt
will
not
spare
him."
"I
cannot
believe
that
he
has
not
the
power
of
coming,
if
