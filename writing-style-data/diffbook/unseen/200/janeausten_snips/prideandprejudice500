improbable.
She
could
not
bear
such
suspense;
and
hastily
seizing
a
sheet
of
paper,
wrote
a
short
letter
to
her
aunt,
to
request
an
explanation
of
what
Lydia
had
dropt,
if
it
were
compatible
with
the
secrecy
which
had
been
intended.
"You
may
readily
comprehend,"
she
added,
"what

an
honourable
manner,
I

tricks
and
stratagems
to
find

Jane's
delicate
sense

to
