ones

knowing,

all."
"Take
care,
Lizzy;
that
speech
savours
strongly
of
disappointment."
Before
they
were
separated
by
the
conclusion
of
the
play,
she
had
the
unexpected
happiness
of
an
invitation
to
accompany
her
uncle
and
aunt
in
a
tour
of
pleasure
which
they
proposed
taking
in
the
summer.
"We
have
not
determined
how
far
it

said
Mrs.

accurate
idea

We
will
know
where

will
recollect

Lakes,
mountains,

not
be
jumbled

in
our
imaginations;
nor
when
we
attempt
to
describe
any
particular
scene,
