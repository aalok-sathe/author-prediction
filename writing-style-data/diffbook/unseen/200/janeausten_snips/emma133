the
evening
without
him,
or
whether
he
should
be
in
the
smallest
degree
necessary
at
Hartfield.
If
he
were,
every
thing
else
must
give
way;
but
otherwise
his
friend
Cole
had
been
saying
so
much
about
his
dining
with
him
had
made
such
a
point
of
it,
that
he
had
promised
him
conditionally
to
come.
Emma
thanked
him,
but
could
not
allow
of
his
disappointing
his
friend
on
their
account;
her
father
was
sure
of
his
rubber.
He
re
urged
she

declined;
and
he
seemed
then

Of

I
have
not
transcribed
beyond
the
first
eight
lines."
Mr.
Elton
certainly
did
not
very
well
know
what
to
say.
He
looked
rather
doubtingly
rather
confused;
said
something
about
"honour,"
glanced
at
Emma
and
at
Harriet,
and
then
seeing
the
book
open
on
the
table,
took
it
up,
