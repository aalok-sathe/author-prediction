We
are
not
on
friendly
terms,
and
it
always
gives
me
pain
to
meet
him,
but
I
have
no
reason
for
avoiding
him
but
what
I
might
proclaim
before
all
the
world,
a
sense
of
very
great
ill

but
the
delicacy

it
prevented
further
inquiry.
Mr.

on
more
general
topics,
Meryton,
the
neighbourhood,

society,
appearing

intelligible
gallantry.
"It
