be
the
most
insufferable
fellow
breathing!
What!
at
three
and
twenty
to
be
the
king
of
his
company
the
great
man
the
practised
politician,
who
is
to
read
every
body's
character,
and
make
every
body's
talents
conduce
to
the
display
of
his
own
superiority;
to
be
dispensing
his
flatteries

that
he

a

I
never
think
of
from
one
month's
end
to
another,"
said
Mr.
Knightley,
with
a
degree
of
vexation,
which
made
