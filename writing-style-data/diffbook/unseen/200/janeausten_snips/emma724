which
was
to
be
kept
at
all
hazards.
This
was
the
fact.
My
right
to
place
myself
in
a
situation
requiring
such
concealment,
is
another
question.
I
shall
not
discuss
it
here.
For
my
temptation
to
think
it
a
right,
I
refer
every
caviller
to
a
brick
house,
sashed
windows
below,
and
casements
above,
in
Highbury.
I
dared
not
address
her
openly;
my
difficulties
in
the
then
state
of
Enscombe
must
be
too
well
known
to
require
definition;
and
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
prevail,
before
we
parted
at
Weymouth,
and
to
induce
the
most
upright
female
mind
in
the
creation
to
stoop
in
charity
to
a
secret
engagement.
Had
she
refused,
I
should
have
gone
mad.
But
you
will
be
ready
to
say,
what
was
your
hope
in
doing
this?
What
did
you
look
forward
to?
To
any
thing,
every
thing
to
time,
chance,
circumstance,
slow
effects,
sudden
bursts,
perseverance
and
weariness,
health
and
sickness.
Every
possibility
of
good
was
before
me,
and
the
first
of
blessings
secured,
in
obtaining
her
promises
of
faith
and
correspondence.
If
you
need
farther
explanation,
I
have
the
honour,
my
dear
madam,
of
being
your
husband's
son,
and
the
advantage
of
inheriting
a
