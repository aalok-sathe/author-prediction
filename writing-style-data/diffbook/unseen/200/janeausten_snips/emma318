in
conversation;
"then
give
me
leave
to
assure
you
that
you
will
find
her
a
very
agreeable
young
lady.
She
is
staying
here
on
a
visit
to
her
grandmama
and
aunt,
very
worthy
people;
I
have
known
them
all
my
life.
They
will
be
extremely
glad
to
see
you,
I
am
sure;
and
one
of
my
servants
shall
go
with
you
to
shew
you
the
way."
"My
dear
sir,
upon
no
account
in
the
world;
my
father
can
direct
me."
"But
your
father
is
not
going
so
far;
he
is
only
going
to
the
Crown,
quite
on
the
other
side
of
the
street,
and
there
are
a
great
many
houses;
you
might
be
very
much
at
a
loss,
and
it
is
a
very
dirty
walk,
unless
you
keep
on
the
footpath;
but
my
coachman
can
tell
you
where
you
had
best
cross
the
street."
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
still
declined
it,
looking
as
serious
as
he
could,
and
his
father
gave
his
hearty
support
by
calling
out,
"My
good
friend,
this
is
quite
unnecessary;
Frank
knows
a
puddle
of
water
when
he
sees
it,
and
as
to
Mrs.
Bates's,
he
may
get
there
from
the
Crown
in
a
hop,
step,
and
