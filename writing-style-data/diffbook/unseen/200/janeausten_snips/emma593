Mrs.
Elton
and
Jane
Fairfax
were
talking
of.
A
situation,
a
most
desirable
situation,
was
in
question.
Mrs.
Elton
had
received
notice
of
it
that
morning,
and
was
in
raptures.
It
was
not
with
Mrs.
Suckling,
it
was
not
with
Mrs.
Bragge,
but
in
felicity
and
splendour
it
fell
short
only
of
them:
it
was
with
a
cousin
of
Mrs.
Bragge,
an
acquaintance
of
Mrs.

repeating
the
same
motives
which
she
had
been
heard
to
urge
before.
Still
Mrs.
Elton
insisted
on
being
authorised
to
write
an
acquiescence
by
the
morrow's
post.
How
Jane
could
bear
it
at
all,
was
astonishing
to
Emma.
She
did
look
vexed,
she
did
speak
pointedly
and
at
last,
with
a
decision
of
action
unusual
to
her,
proposed
a
removal.
"Should
not
they

Would
not
Mr.
Knightley
