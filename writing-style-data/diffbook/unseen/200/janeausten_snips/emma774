all
the
spirits
she
could
command,
she
prepared
him
first
for
something
strange,
and
then,
in
a
few
words,
said,
that
if
his
consent
and
approbation
could
be
obtained
which,
she
trusted,
would
be
attended
with
no
difficulty,
since
it
was
a
plan
to
promote
the
happiness
of
all
she
and
Mr.
Knightley

marry;
by

would
receive

and
poor
Miss
Taylor.
But
it

not
do.
Emma
hung
about
him
affectionately,
and
smiled,
and
said
it
must
be
so;
and
that
he
must
not
class
her
with
Isabella
and
Mrs.
Weston,
whose
marriages
taking
them
from
Hartfield,
had,
indeed,
made
a
melancholy
