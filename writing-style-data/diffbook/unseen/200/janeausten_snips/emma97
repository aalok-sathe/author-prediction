age
she
can
have
no
experience,
and
with
her
little
wit,
is
not
very
likely
ever
to
have
any
that
can
avail
her.
She
is
pretty,
and
she
is
good
tempered,
and
that
is
all.
My
only
scruple
in
advising
the
match
was
on
his
account,
as
being
beneath
his
deserts,
and
a
bad
connexion
for
him.
I
felt
that,
as
to
fortune,
in
all
probability
he
might
do
much
better;
and
that
as
to
a
rational
companion
or
useful
helpmate,
he
could
not
do
worse.
But
I
could
not
reason
so
to
a
man
in
love,
and
was
willing
to
trust
to
there
being
no
harm
in
her,
to
her
having
that
sort
of
disposition,
which,
in
good
hands,
like
his,
might
be
easily
led
aright
and
turn
out
very
well.
The
advantage
of
the
match
I
felt
to
be
all
on
her
side;
and
had
not
the
smallest
doubt
(nor
have
I
now)
that
there
would
be
a
general
cry
out
upon
her
extreme
good
luck.
Even
your
satisfaction
I
made
sure
of.
It
crossed
my
mind
immediately
that
you
would
not
regret
your
friend's
leaving
Highbury,
for
the
sake
of
her
being
settled
so
well.
