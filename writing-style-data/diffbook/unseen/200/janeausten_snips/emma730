to
lose.
I
should
myself
have
shrunk
from
any
thing
so
hasty,
and
she
would
have
felt
every
scruple
of
mine
with
multiplied
strength
and
refinement.
But
I
had
no
choice.
The
hasty
engagement
she
had
entered
into
with
that
woman
Here,
my
dear
madam,
I
was
obliged
to
leave
off
abruptly,
to
recollect
and
compose
myself.
I
have
been
walking
over
the
country,
and
am
now,
I
hope,
rational
enough
to
make
the
rest
of
my
letter
what
it
ought
to
be.
It
is,
in
fact,
a
most
mortifying
retrospect
for
me.
I
behaved
shamefully.
And
here
I
can
admit,
that
my
manners
to
Miss
W.,
in
being
unpleasant
to
Miss
F.,
were
highly
blameable.
She
disapproved
them,
which
ought
to
have
been
enough.
My
plea
of
concealing
the
truth
she
did
not
think
sufficient.
She
was
displeased;
I
thought
unreasonably
so:
I
thought
her,
on
a
thousand
occasions,
unnecessarily
scrupulous
and
cautious:
I
thought
her
even
cold.
But
she
was
always
right.
If
I
had
followed
her
judgment,
and
subdued
my
spirits
to
the
level
of
what
she
deemed
proper,
I
should
have
escaped
the
greatest
unhappiness
I
have
ever
known.
We
quarrelled.
Do
you
remember
the
morning
