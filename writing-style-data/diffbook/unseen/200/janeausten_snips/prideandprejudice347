opposed
the
scheme.
It
should
not
be
said
that
the
Miss
Bennets
could
not
be
at
home
half
a
day
before
they
were
in
pursuit
of
the
officers.
There
was
another
reason
too
for
her
opposition.
She
dreaded
seeing
Mr.
Wickham
again,
and
was
resolved
to
avoid
it
as
long
as
possible.
The
comfort
to
her
of
the
regiment's
approaching
removal
was
indeed
beyond
expression.
In

they
were
to

time
so
vague
and
equivocal,
that
her
mother,
though
often
disheartened,
had
never
yet
despaired
of
succeeding
at
last.
Elizabeth's
impatience
to
acquaint
Jane
with
what
had
happened
could
no
longer
be
overcome;
and
at
length,
resolving
to
suppress
every
particular
in
which
her
sister
was
concerned,
and
preparing
her
to
be
surprised,
she
