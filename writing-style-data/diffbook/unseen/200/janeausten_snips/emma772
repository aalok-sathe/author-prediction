doing
you
justice.
He
will
think
all
the
happiness,
all
the
advantage,
on
your
side
of
the
question;
all
the
merit
on
mine.
I
wish
I
may
not
sink
into
'poor
Emma'
with
him
at
once.
His
tender
compassion
towards
oppressed
worth
can
go
no

your
father
might
be
half
as

"Yes,
yes

I
am
amused
that
he
should
have
seen
so
far
into
my
feelings.
What
has
he
been
judging

I
am
not
conscious
of
any
difference
in
my
