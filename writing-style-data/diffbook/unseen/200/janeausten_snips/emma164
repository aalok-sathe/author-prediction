After
a
little
more
discourse
in
praise
of
gruel,
with
some
wondering
at
its
not
being
taken
every
evening
by
every
body,
he
proceeded
to
say,
with
an
air
of
grave
reflection,
"It
was
an
awkward
business,
my
dear,
your
spending
the
autumn
at
South
End

here.
I

cried
Emma,
feeling
this

be
an
unsafe
subject,
"I
must
beg
you
not

the
sea.
It
