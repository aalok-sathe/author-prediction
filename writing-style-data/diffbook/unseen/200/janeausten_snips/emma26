inclination)
that
wedding
cake
might
certainly
disagree
with
many
perhaps
with
most
people,
unless
taken
moderately.
With
such
an
opinion,
in
confirmation
of
his
own,
Mr.
Woodhouse
hoped
to
influence
every
visitor
of
the
newly
married
pair;
but
still
the
cake
was
eaten;
and
there
was
no
rest
for
his
benevolent
nerves
till
it
was
all
gone.
There
was
a
strange
rumour
in
Highbury
of
all
the
little
Perrys
being
seen
with
a
slice
of
Mrs.
Weston's
wedding
cake
in
their
hands:
but
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
never
believe
it.
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
fond
of
society
in
his
own
way.
He
liked
very
much
to
have
his
friends
come
and
see
him;
and
from
various
united
causes,
from
his
long
residence
at
Hartfield,
and
his
good
nature,
from
his
fortune,
his
house,
and
his
daughter,
he
could
command
the
visits
of
his
own
little
circle,
in
a
great
measure,
as
he
liked.
He
had
not
much
intercourse
with
any
families
beyond
that
circle;
his
horror
of
late
hours,
and
large
dinner
parties,
made
him
unfit
for
any
acquaintance
but
such
as
would
visit
him
on
his
own
terms.
Fortunately
for
him,
Highbury,
including
Randalls
in
the
same
parish,
and
Donwell
Abbey
