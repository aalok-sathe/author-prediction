was
written,
and
sealed,
and
sent.
The
business
was
finished,
and
Harriet
safe.
She
was
rather
low
all
the
evening,
but
Emma
could
allow
for
her
amiable
regrets,
and
sometimes
relieved
them
by
speaking
of
her
own
affection,
sometimes
by
bringing
forward
the
idea
of
Mr.
Elton.
"I
shall
never
be
invited
to
Abbey
Mill
again,"
was
said
in

draper."
"One
should
be
sorry
to
see
greater
pride
or
refinement
in
the
teacher
of
a
school,
Harriet.
I
dare
say
Miss
Nash
would
envy
you
such
an
opportunity
as
this

Even

eyes.
