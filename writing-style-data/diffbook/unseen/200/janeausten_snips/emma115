have
no
right
to
expose
it
in
any
degree
to
the
public
eye,
but
perhaps
you
may
not
dislike
looking
at
it."
The
speech
was
more
to
Emma
than
to
Harriet,
which
Emma
could
understand.
There
was
deep
consciousness
about
him,
and
he
found
it
easier
to
meet
her
eye
than
her
friend's.
He
was
gone
the
next
moment:
after
another
moment's
pause,
"Take
it,"
said
Emma,
smiling,
and
pushing
the
paper
towards
Harriet
"it
is
for
you.
Take
your
own."
But
Harriet
was
in
a
tremor,
and
could
not
touch
it;
and
Emma,
never
loth
to
be
first,
was
obliged
to
examine
it
herself.
To
Miss
CHARADE.
My
first
displays
the
wealth
and
pomp
of
kings,
Lords
of
the
earth!
their
luxury
and
ease.
Another
view
of
man,
my
second
brings,
Behold
him
there,
the
monarch
of
the
seas!
But
ah!
united,
what
reverse
we
have!
Man's
boasted
power
and
freedom,
all
are
flown;
Lord
of
the
earth
and
sea,
he
bends
a
slave,
And
woman,
lovely
woman,
reigns
alone.
Thy
ready
wit
the
word
will
soon
supply,
May
its
approval
beam
in
that
soft
eye!
She
cast
her
eye
over
it,
pondered,
caught
the
meaning,
read
it
through
