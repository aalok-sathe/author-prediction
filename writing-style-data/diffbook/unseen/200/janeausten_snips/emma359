in
the
drawing
room,
before
the
other
ladies,
in
their
different
divisions,
arrived.
Emma
watched
the
entree
of
her
own
particular
little
friend;
and
if
she
could
not
exult
in
her
dignity
and
grace,
she
could
not
only
love
the
blooming
sweetness
and
the
artless
manner,
but
could
most
heartily
rejoice
in
that
light,
cheerful,
unsentimental
disposition
which
allowed
her
so
many
alleviations
of
pleasure,
in
the
midst
of
the
pangs
of
disappointed
affection.
There
she
sat
and
who
would
have
guessed
how
many
tears
she
had
been
lately
shedding?
To
be
in
company,
nicely
dressed
herself
and
seeing
others
nicely
dressed,
to
sit
and
smile
and
look
pretty,
and
say
nothing,
was
enough
for
the
happiness
of
the
present
hour.
Jane
Fairfax
did
look
and
move
superior;
but
Emma
suspected
she
might
have
been
glad
to
change
feelings
with
Harriet,
very
glad
to
have
purchased
the
mortification
of
having
loved
yes,
of
having
loved
even
Mr.
Elton
in
vain
by
the
surrender
of
all
the
dangerous
pleasure
of
knowing
herself
beloved
by
the
husband
of
her
friend.
In
so
large
a
party
it
was
not
necessary
that
Emma
should
approach
her.
She
did
not
wish
to
speak
of
the
