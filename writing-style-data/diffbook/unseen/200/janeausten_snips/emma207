but
had
not
said
a
word,
lest
it
should
make
Mr.
Woodhouse
uncomfortable,
and
be
an
excuse
for
his
hurrying
away.
As
to
there
being
any
quantity
of
snow
fallen
or
likely
to
fall
to
impede
their
return,
that
was
a
mere
joke;
he
was
afraid
they
would
find
no
difficulty.
He
wished
the
road
might
be
impassable,
that
he
might
be
able
to
keep
them
all
at
Randalls;
and
with
the
utmost
good
will
was
sure
that
accommodation
might
be
found
for
every
body,
calling
on
his
wife
to
agree
with
him,
that
with
a
little
contrivance,
every
body
might
be
lodged,
which
she
hardly
knew
how
to
do,
from
the
consciousness
of
there
being
but
two
spare
rooms
in
the
house.
"What
is
to
be
done,
my
dear
Emma?
what
is
to
be
done?"
was
Mr.
Woodhouse's
first
exclamation,
and
all
that
he
could
say
for
some
time.
To
her
he
looked
for
comfort;
and
her
assurances
of
safety,
her
representation
of
the
excellence
of
the
horses,
and
of
James,
and
of
their
having
so
many
friends
about
them,
revived
him
a
little.
His
eldest
daughter's
alarm
was
equal
to
his
own.
The
horror
of
being
blocked
up
