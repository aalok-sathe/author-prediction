and
gratitude,
both
for
Harriet
and
herself,
and
longed
to
be
thanking
him;
and
though
too
distant
for
speech,
her
countenance
said
much,
as
soon
as
she
could
catch
his
eye
again.
His
dancing
proved
to
be
just
what
she
had
believed
it,
extremely
good;
and
Harriet
would
have
seemed
almost
too
lucky,
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
cruel
state
of
things
before,
and
for
the
very
complete
enjoyment
and
very
high
sense
of
the
distinction
which
her
happy
features
announced.
It
was
not
thrown
away
on
her,
she
bounded
higher
than
ever,
flew
farther
down
the
middle,
and
was
in
a
continual
course
of
smiles.
Mr.
Elton
had
retreated
into
the
card
room,
looking
(Emma
trusted)
very
foolish.
She
did
not
think
he
was
quite
so
hardened
as
his
wife,
though
growing
very
like
her;
she
spoke
some
of
her
feelings,
by
observing
audibly
to
her
partner,
"Knightley
has
taken
pity
on
poor
little
Miss
Smith!
Very
good
natured,
I
declare."
Supper
was
announced.
The
move
began;
and
Miss
Bates
might
be
heard
from
that
moment,
without
interruption,
till
her
being
seated
at
table
and
taking
up
her
spoon.
"Jane,
Jane,
my
dear
Jane,
where
are
you?
