a
very
agreeable
evening
we
had.
Such
kind
friends,
you
know,
Miss
Woodhouse,
one
must
always
find
agreeable,
though
every
body
seemed
rather
fagged
after
the
morning's
party.
Even
pleasure,
you
know,
is
fatiguing
and
I
cannot
say
that
any
of
them
seemed
very
much
to
have
enjoyed
it.
However,
I
shall
always
think
it
a
very
pleasant
party,
and
feel
extremely
obliged
to
the
kind
friends
who
included
me
in
it."
"Miss
Fairfax,

you
were

"I
dare
say
she
had."
"Whenever
the
time
may
come,
it
must
be
unwelcome
to
her
and
all
her
friends
but
I
hope
her
engagement
will
have
every
alleviation
that
is
possible
I
mean,
as
to
the
character
and
manners
of
the
family."
"Thank
you,
dear
Miss
Woodhouse.
Yes,
indeed,
there
is
every
thing
in
the
world
that
can
make
her
happy
in
it.
Except
the
Sucklings
and
Bragges,
there
is
not
such
another
nursery
establishment,
so
liberal
and
elegant,
in
all
Mrs.
Elton's
acquaintance.
Mrs.
Smallridge,
a
most
delightful
woman!
A
style
of
living
almost
equal
to
Maple
Grove
and
as
to
the
children,
except
