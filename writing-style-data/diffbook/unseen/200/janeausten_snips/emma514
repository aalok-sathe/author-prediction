which
would
have
made
her
prefer
being
silent.
Mr.
John
Knightley
proved
more
talkative
than
his
brother.
He
was
to
leave
them
early
the
next
day;
and
he
soon
began
with
"Well,
Emma,
I
do
not
believe
I
have
any
thing
more
to
say
about
the
boys;
but
you
have
your
sister's
letter,
and
every
thing
is
down
at
full
length
there
we
may
be
sure.
My
charge
would
be
much
more
concise
than
her's,
and
probably
not
much
in
the
same
spirit;
all
that
I
have
to
recommend
being
comprised
in,
do
not
spoil
them,
and
do
not
physic
them."
"I
rather
hope
to
satisfy
you
both,"
said
Emma,
"for
I
shall
do
all
in
my
power
to
make
them
happy,
which
will
be
enough
for
Isabella;
and
happiness
must
preclude
false
indulgence
and
physic."
"And
if
you
find
them
troublesome,
you
must
send
them
home
again."
"That
is
very
likely.
You
think
so,
do
not
you?"
"I
hope
I
am
aware
that
they
may
be
too
noisy
for
your
father
or
even
may
be
some
encumbrance
to
you,
if
your
visiting
engagements
continue
to
increase
as
much
as
they
have
done
lately."
"Increase!"
"Certainly;
you
must
be
sensible
