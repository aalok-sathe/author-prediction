sure
I
shall
break
mine,"
said
Lydia.
"If
one
could
but
go
to
Brighton!"
observed
Mrs.
Bennet.
"Oh,
yes!
if
one
could
but
go
to
Brighton!
But
papa
is
so
disagreeable."
"A
little
sea
bathing
would
set
me
up
forever."
"And
my
aunt
Phillips
is
sure
it
would
do
me
a
great
deal
of
good,"
added
Kitty.
Such
were
the
kind
of
lamentations
resounding
perpetually
through
Longbourn
House.
Elizabeth
tried
to
be
diverted
by
them;
but
all
sense
of
pleasure
was
lost
in
shame.
She
felt
anew
the
justice
of
Mr.
Darcy's
objections;
and
never
had
she
been
so
much
disposed
to
pardon
his
interference
in
the
views
of
his
friend.
But
the
gloom
of
Lydia's
prospect
was
shortly
cleared
away;
for
she
received
an
invitation
from
Mrs.
Forster,
the
wife
of
the
colonel
of
the
regiment,
to
accompany
her
to
Brighton.
This
invaluable
friend
was
a
very
young
woman,
and
very
lately
married.
A
resemblance
in
good
humour
and
good
spirits
had
recommended
her
and
Lydia
to
each
other,
and
out
of
their
three
months'
acquaintance
they
had
been
intimate
two.
The
rapture
of
Lydia
on
this
occasion,
her
adoration
of
Mrs.
Forster,
the
delight
of
Mrs.
Bennet,
and
