intend
leaving
her
room
for
a
couple
of
hours
that
evening.
When
the
ladies
removed
after
dinner,
Elizabeth
ran
up
to
her
sister,
and
seeing
her
well
guarded
from
cold,
attended
her
into
the
drawing
room,
where
she
was
welcomed
by
her
two
friends
with
many
professions
of
pleasure;
and
Elizabeth
had
never
seen
them
so
agreeable
as
they
were
during
the
hour
which
passed
before
the
gentlemen
appeared.
Their
powers
of
conversation
were
considerable.
They
could
describe
an
entertainment
with
accuracy,
relate
an
anecdote
with
humour,
and
laugh
at
their
acquaintance
with
spirit.
But
when
the
gentlemen
entered,
Jane
was
no
longer
the
first
object;
Miss
Bingley's
eyes
were
instantly
turned
toward
Darcy,
and
she
had
something
to
say
to
him
before
he
had
advanced
many
steps.
He
addressed
himself
to
Miss
Bennet,
with
a
polite
congratulation;
Mr.
Hurst
also
made
her
a
slight
bow,
and
said
he
was
"very
glad;"
but
diffuseness
and
warmth
remained
for
Bingley's
salutation.
He
was
full
of
joy
and
attention.
The
first
half
hour
was
spent
in
piling
up
the
fire,
lest
she
should
suffer
from
the
change
of
room;
and
she
removed
at
his
desire
to
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace,
