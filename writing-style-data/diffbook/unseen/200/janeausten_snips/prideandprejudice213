Stop

whilst
you
can."
"You
persist,
then,
in
supposing
his
sisters
influence
him?"
"Yes,
in
conjunction
with
his
friend."
"I
cannot
believe
it.
Why
should
they
try
to
influence
him?
They
can
only
wish
his
happiness;
and
if
he
is
attached
to
me,
no
other
woman
can
secure

"Your
first
position
is
false.
They
may
wish
many
things
besides
his

they
may
wish

increase
of
wealth
and

"Beyond
a

they
do
wish
him
to
choose
Miss
Darcy,"
replied
Jane;
"but
this
may
be

better.
But,
whatever
may
be
their
own
wishes,
it
is
very
unlikely
they
should
have
opposed
their
brother's.
What
sister
would
think
herself
at
liberty
to
do
it,
unless
there
were
something
very
objectionable?
If
they
believed
him
attached
to
me,
they
would
not
try
to
part
us;
if
he
were
so,
they
could
not
succeed.
By
supposing
such
an
affection,
you
make
everybody
