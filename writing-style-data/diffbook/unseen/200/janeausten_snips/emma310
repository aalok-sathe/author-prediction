his
very
civil
welcome
and
congratulations,
when
she
appeared,
to
have
her
share
of
surprize,
introduction,
and
pleasure.
The
Frank
Churchill
so
long
talked
of,
so
high
in
interest,
was
actually
before
her
he
was
presented
to
her,
and
she
did
not
think
too
much
had
been
said
in
his
praise;
he
was
a
very
good
looking
young
man;
height,
air,
address,
all
were
unexceptionable,
and
his
countenance
had
a
great
deal
of
the
spirit
and
liveliness
of
his
father's;
he
looked
quick
and
sensible.
She
felt
immediately
that
she
should
like
him;
and
there
was
a
well
bred
ease
of
manner,
and
a
readiness
to
talk,
which
convinced
her
that
he
came
intending
to
be
acquainted
with
her,
and
that
acquainted
they
soon
must
be.
He
had
reached
Randalls
the
evening
before.
She
was
pleased
with
the
eagerness
to
arrive
which
had
made
him
alter
his
plan,
and
travel
earlier,
later,
and
quicker,
that
he
might
gain
half
a
day.
"I
told
you
yesterday,"
cried
Mr.
Weston
with
exultation,
"I
told
you
all
that
he
would
be
here
before
the
time
named.
I
remembered
what
I
used
to
do
myself.
One
cannot
creep
upon
a
journey;
one
cannot
help
