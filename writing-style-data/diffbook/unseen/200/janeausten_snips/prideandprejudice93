"Dear
Sir,
"The
disagreement
subsisting
between
yourself
and
my
late
honoured
father
always
gave
me
much
uneasiness,
and
since
I
have
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
him,
I
have
frequently
wished
to
heal
the
breach;
but
for
some
time
I
was
kept
back
by
my
own
doubts,
fearing
lest
it
might
seem
disrespectful
to
his
memory
for
me
to
be
on
good
terms
with
anyone
with
whom
it
had
always
pleased
him
to
be
at
variance.
'There,
Mrs.
Bennet.'
My
mind,
however,
is
now
made
up
on
the
subject,
for
having
received
ordination
at
Easter,
I
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
be
distinguished
by
the
patronage
of
the
Right
Honourable
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh,
widow
of
Sir
Lewis
de
Bourgh,
whose
bounty
and
beneficence
has
preferred
me
to
the
valuable
rectory
of
this
parish,
where
it
shall
be
my
earnest
endeavour
to
demean
myself
with
grateful
respect
towards
her
ladyship,
and
be
ever
ready
to
perform
those
rites
and
ceremonies
which
are
instituted
by
the
Church
of
England.
As
a
clergyman,
moreover,
I
feel
it
my
duty
to
promote
and
establish
the
blessing
of
peace
in
all
families
within
the
reach
of
my
influence;
and
on
these
grounds
I
