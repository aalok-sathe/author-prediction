By
this
time,
the
walk
in
the
rain
had
reached
Mrs.
Elton,
and
her
remonstrances
now
opened
upon
Jane.
"My
dear
Jane,
what
is
this
I
hear?
Going
to
the
post
office
in
the
rain!
This
must
not
be,
I
assure
you.
You
sad
girl,
how
could
you
do
such
a
thing?
It
is
a
sign
I
was
not
there
to
take
care

Jane
very

assured
her
that

and
persuasively,
"I
certainly
do
feel
tempted
to
give.
Miss
Fairfax,
you
must
not
run
such
risks.
Liable
as
you
have
been
to
severe
colds,
indeed
you
ought
to
be
particularly
careful,
especially
at
this
time
of
year.
The
spring
I
always
think
requires
more
than
common
care.
Better
wait
an
hour
or
two,
or
even
half
a
day
for
your
letters,
than
run
the
risk
of
bringing
on
your
cough
again.
Now
