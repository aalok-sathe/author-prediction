I
hope
you
will
not
find
he
has
outstepped
the
truth
more
than
may
be
pardoned,
in
consideration
of
the
motive."
"No,
indeed,
I
have
no
doubts
at
all
on
that
head.
I
am
delighted
to
find
myself
in
such
a
circle.
I
hope
we
shall
have
many
sweet
little
concerts
together.
I
think,
Miss
Woodhouse,
you
and
I
must
establish
a
musical
club,
and
have
regular
weekly
meetings
at
your
house,
or
ours.
Will

I

of
allies.

an
inducement
to
keep

for
married
women,
you
know
there
is
a
sad
story
against
them,
in
general.
They
are
but
too
apt

give
up
music."
"But
you,
who
are
so
extremely
fond
of
it
there
can
be
no
danger,
surely?"
"I
should
hope
not;
but
really
when
I
look
around
among
my
acquaintance,
I
tremble.
Selina
has
entirely
given
up
music
never
touches
the
instrument
though
she
played
sweetly.
And
the
same
may
be
said
of
Mrs.
Jeffereys
Clara
Partridge,
that

of
the
two
Milmans,
