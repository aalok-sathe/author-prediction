that
half
this
folly
must
be
drunkenness,
and
therefore
could
hope
that
it
might
belong
only
to
the
passing
hour.
Accordingly,
with
a
mixture
of
the
serious
and
the
playful,
which
she
hoped
would
best
suit
his
half
and
half
state,
she
replied,
"I
am
very
much
astonished,
Mr.
Elton.
This
to
me!
you
forget
yourself
you
take
me
for
my
friend

shall
be
happy
to
deliver;

not

or
you
could
not
speak
either
to
me,
or
of
Harriet,
in
such
a
manner.
Command
yourself
enough
to
say
no
more,
and
I
will
endeavour
to
forget
it."
But
Mr.
Elton
had
only
drunk
wine
enough
to
elevate
his
spirits,
not
at
all
to
confuse
his
intellects.
He
perfectly
knew
his
own
meaning;
and
having
warmly
protested
against
her
suspicion
