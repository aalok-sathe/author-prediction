the
world
but
there.
Oh!
dear,
Miss
Woodhouse
well,
at
last,
I
fancy,
he
looked
round
and
saw
me;
for
instead
of
going
on
with
her
buyings,
they
began
whispering
to
one
another.
I
am
sure
they
were
talking
of
me;
and
I
could
not
help
thinking
that
he
was
persuading
her
to
speak
to
me
(do
you
think
he
was,
Miss
Woodhouse?)
for
presently
she
came
forward
came
quite
up
to
me,
and
asked
me
how
I
did,
and
seemed
ready
to
shake
hands,
if
I
would.
She
did
not
do
any
of
it
in
the
same
way
that
she
used;
I
could
see
she
was
altered;
but,
however,
she
seemed
to
try
to
be
very
friendly,
and
we
shook
hands,
and
stood
talking
some
time;
but
I
know
no
more
what
I
said
I
was
in
such
a
tremble!
I
remember
she
said
she
was
sorry
we
never
met
now;
which
I
thought
almost
too
kind!
Dear,
Miss
Woodhouse,
I
was
absolutely
miserable!
By
that
time,
it
was
beginning
to
hold
up,
and
I
was
determined
that
nothing
should
stop
me
from
getting
away
and
then
only
think!
I
found
he
was
coming
up
towards
me
too
slowly
