living
constantly
with
her
father,
and
in
no
house
of
his
own,
there
would
be
much,
very
much,
to
be
borne
with.
She
promised
to
think
of
it,
and
advised
him
to
think
of
it
more;
but
he
was
fully
convinced,
that
no
reflection
could
alter
his
wishes
or
his
opinion
on
the
subject.
He
had
given
it,
he
could
assure
her,
very
long
and
calm
consideration;
he
had
been
walking
away
from
William
Larkins
the
whole
morning,
to
have
his
thoughts
to
himself.
"Ah!
there
is
one
difficulty
unprovided
for,"
cried
Emma.
"I
am
sure
William
Larkins
will
not
like
it.
You
must
get
his
consent
before
you
ask
mine."
She
promised,
however,
to
think
of
it;
and
pretty
nearly
promised,
moreover,
to
think
of
it,
with
the
intention
of
finding
it
a
very
good
scheme.
It
is
remarkable,
that
Emma,
in
the
many,
very
many,
points
of
view
in
which
she
was
now
beginning
to
consider
Donwell
Abbey,
was
never
struck
with
any
sense
of
injury
to
her
nephew
Henry,
whose
rights
as
heir
expectant
had
formerly
been
so
tenaciously
regarded.
Think
she
must
of
the
possible
difference
to
the
poor
little
boy;
and
yet
she
only
gave
