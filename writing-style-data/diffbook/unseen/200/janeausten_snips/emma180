cold,
certainly
very
cold,"
and
walked
on,
rejoicing
in
having
extricated
him
from
Randalls,
and
secured
him
the
power
of
sending
to
inquire
after
Harriet
every
hour
of
the
evening.
"You
do
quite
right,"
said
she;
"we
will
make
your
apologies
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston."
But
hardly
had
she
so
spoken,
when
she
found
her
brother
was
civilly
offering
a
seat
in
his
carriage,
if
the
weather
were
Mr.
Elton's
only
objection,
and
Mr.
Elton
actually
accepting
the
offer
with
much
prompt
satisfaction.
It
was
a
done
thing;
Mr.
Elton
was
to
go,
and
never
had
his
broad
handsome
face
expressed
more
pleasure
than
at
this
moment;
never
had
his
smile
been
stronger,
nor
his
eyes
more
exulting
than
when
he
next
looked
at
her.
"Well,"
said
she
to
herself,
"this
is
most
strange!
After
I
had
got
him
off
so
well,
to
chuse
to
go
into
company,
and
leave
Harriet
ill
behind!
Most
strange
indeed!
But
there
is,
I
believe,
in
many
men,
especially
single
men,
such
an
inclination
such
a
passion
for
dining
out
a
dinner
engagement
is
so
high
in
the
class
of
their
pleasures,
their
employments,
their
dignities,
almost
their
duties,
that
any
thing
