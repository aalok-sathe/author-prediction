to
every
morning
visitor
in
Brunswick
Square;
and,
as
I
said,
I
did
then
forswear
ever
drawing
any
body
again.
But
for
Harriet's
sake,
or
rather
for
my
own,
and
as
there
are
no
husbands
and
wives
in
the
case
at
present,
I
will
break
my
resolution
now."
Mr.
Elton
seemed
very
properly
struck
and
delighted
by
the
idea,
and
was
repeating,
"No
husbands
and
wives
in
the
case
at
present
indeed,
as
you
observe.
Exactly
so.
No
husbands
and
wives,"
with
so
interesting
a
consciousness,
that
Emma
began
to
consider
whether
she
had
not
better
leave
them
together
at
once.
But
as
she
wanted
to
be
drawing,
the
declaration
must
wait
a
little
longer.
She
had
soon
fixed
on
the
size
and
sort
of
portrait.
It
was
to
be
a
whole
length
in
water
colours,
like
Mr.
John
Knightley's,
and
was
destined,
if
she
could
please
herself,
to
hold
a
very
honourable
station
over
the
mantelpiece.
The
sitting
began;
and
Harriet,
smiling
and
blushing,
and
afraid
of
not
keeping
her
attitude
and
countenance,
presented
a
very
sweet
mixture
of
youthful
expression
to
the
steady
eyes
of
the
artist.
But
there
was
no
doing
any
thing,
with
Mr.
Elton
fidgeting
