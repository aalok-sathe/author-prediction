the
popular
qualities,
or
lose
the
influence
of
the
Pemberley
House,
is
a
powerful
motive.
He
has
also
brotherly
pride,
which,
with
some
brotherly
affection,
makes
him
a
very
kind
and
careful
guardian
of
his
sister,
and
you
will
hear
him
generally
cried
up
as
the
most
attentive
and
best
of
brothers."
"What
sort
of
girl
is
Miss
Darcy?"
He
shook
his
head.
"I
wish
I
could
call
her
amiable.
It
gives
me
pain
to
speak
ill
of
a
Darcy.
But
she
is
too
much
like
her
brother
very,
very
proud.
As
a
child,
she
was
affectionate
and
pleasing,
and
extremely
fond
of
me;
and
I
have
devoted
hours
and

to
her
amusement.
But
she
is
nothing
to

now.
She
is
a
handsome
girl,
about
fifteen
or
sixteen,
and,
I
understand,
highly
accomplished.
Since
her
father's
death,
her
home
has
been
London,
where
a
lady
lives
with
her,
and
superintends
her
education."
After
many
pauses
and
many
trials
of
other
subjects,
Elizabeth
could
not
help
reverting
once
more
to
the
first,
and
saying:
"I
am
astonished
at
his
intimacy
with
Mr.
Bingley!
How
can
Mr.
Bingley,
who
seems
good
humour
itself,
and
is,
I
really
believe,
truly
amiable,
