passed
much
as
the
day
before
had
done.
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
had
spent
some
hours
of
the
morning
with
the
invalid,
who
continued,
though
slowly,
to
mend;
and
in
the
evening
Elizabeth
joined
their
party
in
the
drawing
room.
The
loo
table,
however,
did
not
appear.
Mr.
Darcy
was
writing,
and
Miss
Bingley,
seated
near
him,
was
watching
the
progress
of
his
letter
and
repeatedly
calling
off
his
attention
by
messages
to
his
sister.
Mr.
Hurst
and
Mr.
Bingley
were
at
piquet,
and
Mrs.
Hurst
was
observing
their
game.
Elizabeth
took
up
some
needlework,
and
was
sufficiently
amused
in
attending
to
what
passed
between
Darcy
and
his
companion.
The
perpetual
commendations
of
the
lady,
either
on
his
handwriting,
or
on
the
evenness
of
his
lines,
or
on
the
length
of
his
letter,
with
the
perfect
unconcern
with
which
her
praises
were
received,
formed
a
curious
dialogue,
and
was
exactly
in
union
with
her
opinion
of
each.
"How
delighted
Miss
Darcy
will
be
to
receive
such
a
letter!"
He
made
no
answer.
"You
write
uncommonly
fast."
"You
are
mistaken.
I
write
rather
slowly."
"How
many
letters
you
must
have
occasion
to
write
in
the
course
of
a
year!
