will
be
the
object
of
all
my
thoughts
and
cares!
and
if
my
uncle
and
aunt
go
to
town
this
spring
but
I
am
afraid
they
did
not
stir
last
spring
I
am
afraid
it
is
a
custom
gone
for
ever."
"Our
poor
ball
must
be
quite
given
up."
"Ah!
that
ball!
why
did
we
wait
for
any
thing?
why
not
seize
the
pleasure
at
once?
How
often
is
happiness
destroyed
by
preparation,
foolish
preparation!
You
told
us
it
would
be
so.
Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
why
are
you
always
so
right?"
"Indeed,
I
am
very
sorry
to
be
right
in
this
instance.
I
would
much
rather
have
been
merry
than
wise."
"If
I
can
come
again,
we
are
still
to
have
our
ball.
My
father
depends
on
it.
Do
not
forget
your
engagement."
Emma
looked
graciously.
"Such
a
fortnight
as
it
has
been!"
he
continued;
"every
day
more
precious
and
more
delightful
than
the
day
before!
every
day
making
me
less
fit
to
bear
any
other
place.
Happy
those,
who
can
remain
at
Highbury!"
"As
you
do
us
such
ample
justice
now,"
said
Emma,
laughing,
"I
will
venture
to
ask,
whether
you
did
not
come
a
little
doubtfully
at
first?
