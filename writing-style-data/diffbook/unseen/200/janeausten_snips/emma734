be
captious.
We
removed
to
Windsor;
and
two
days
afterwards
I
received
a
parcel
from
her,
my
own
letters
all
returned!
and
a
few
lines
at
the
same
time
by
the
post,
stating
her
extreme
surprize
at
not
having
had
the
smallest
reply
to
her
last;
and
adding,
that
as
silence
on
such
a
point
could
not
be
misconstrued,
and
as
it
must
be
equally
desirable
to
both
to
have
every
subordinate
arrangement
concluded
as
soon
as
possible,
she
now
sent
me,
by
a
safe
conveyance,
all
my
letters,
and
requested,
that
if
I
could
not
directly
command
hers,
so
as
to
send
them
to
Highbury
within
a
week,
I
would
forward
them
after
that
period
to
her
at

in
short,
the
full
direction
to
Mr.
Smallridge's,
near
Bristol,
stared
me
in
the
face.
I
knew
the
name,
the
place,
I
knew
all
about
it,
and
instantly
saw
what
she
had
been
doing.
It
was
perfectly
accordant
with
that
resolution
of
character
which
I
knew
her
to
possess;
and
the
secrecy
she
had
maintained,
as
to
any
such
design
in
her
former
letter,
was
equally
descriptive
of
its
anxious
delicacy.
For
the
world
would
not
she
have
seemed
to
