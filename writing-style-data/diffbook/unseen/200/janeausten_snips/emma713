have
been
a
very
indifferent
lover.
But
you
understand
me.
Yes,
you
see,
you
understand
my
feelings
and
will
return
them
if
you
can.
At
present,
I
ask
only
to
hear,
once
to
hear
your
voice."
While
he
spoke,
Emma's
mind
was
most
busy,
and,
with
all
the
wonderful
velocity
of
thought,
had
been
able
and
yet
without
losing
a
word
to
catch
and
comprehend
the
exact
truth
of
the
whole;
to
see
that
Harriet's
hopes
had
been
entirely
groundless,
a
mistake,
a
delusion,
as
complete
a
delusion
as
any
of
her
own
that
Harriet
was
nothing;
that
she
was
every
thing
herself;
that
what
she
had
been
saying
relative
to
Harriet
had
been
all
taken
as
the
language
of
her
own
feelings;
and
that
her
agitation,
her
doubts,
her
reluctance,
her
discouragement,
had
been
all
received
as
discouragement
from
herself.
And
not
only
was
there
time
for
these
convictions,
with
all
their
glow
of
attendant
happiness;
there
was
time
also
to
rejoice
that
Harriet's
secret
had
not
escaped
her,
and
to
resolve
that
it
need
not,
and
should
not.
It
was
all
the
service
she
could
now
render
her
poor
friend;
for
as
to
any
of
that
heroism
of
