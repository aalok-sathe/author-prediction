so
did
their
satisfaction
in
each
other.
As
a
walking
companion,
Emma
had
very
early
foreseen
how
useful
she
might
find
her.
In
that
respect
Mrs.
Weston's
loss
had
been
important.
Her
father
never
went
beyond
the
shrubbery,
where
two
divisions
of
the
ground
sufficed
him
for
his
long
walk,
or
his
short,
as
the
year
varied;
and
since
Mrs.
Weston's
marriage
her
exercise
had
been
too
much
confined.
She
had
ventured
once
alone
to
Randalls,
but
it
was
not
pleasant;
and
a
Harriet
Smith,
therefore,
one
whom
she
could
summon
at
any
time
to
a
walk,
would
be
a
valuable
addition
to
her
privileges.
But
in
every
respect,
as
she
saw
more
of
her,
she
approved
her,
and
was
confirmed
in
all
her
kind
designs.
Harriet
certainly
was
not
clever,
but
she
had
a
sweet,
docile,
grateful
disposition,
was
totally
free
from
conceit,
and
only
desiring
to
be
guided
by
any
one
she
looked
up
to.
Her
early
attachment
to
herself
was
very
amiable;
and
her
inclination
for
good
company,
and
power
of
appreciating
what
was
elegant
and
clever,
shewed
that
there
was
no
want
of
taste,
though
strength
of
understanding
must
not
be
expected.
Altogether
she
was
