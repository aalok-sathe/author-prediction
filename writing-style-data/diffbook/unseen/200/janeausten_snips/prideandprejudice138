could
not
dwell
long
on
her
spirits;
and
having
told
all
her
griefs
to
Charlotte
Lucas,
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
a
week,
she
was
soon
able
to
make
a
voluntary
transition
to
the
oddities
of
her
cousin,
and
to
point
him
out
to
her
particular
notice.
The
first
two
dances,
however,
brought
a
return
of
distress;
they
were
dances
of
mortification.
Mr.
Collins,
awkward
and
solemn,
apologising
instead
of
attending,
and
often
moving
wrong
without
being
aware
of
it,
gave
her
all
the
shame
and
misery
which
a
disagreeable
partner
for
a
couple
of
dances
can
give.
The
moment
of
her
release
from
him
was
ecstasy.
She
danced
next
with
an
officer,
and
had
the
refreshment
of
talking
of
Wickham,
and
of
hearing
that
he
was
universally
liked.
When
those
dances
were
over,
she
returned
to
Charlotte
Lucas,
and
was
in
conversation
with
her,
when
she
found
herself
suddenly
addressed
by
Mr.
Darcy
who
took
her
so
much
by
surprise
in
his
application
for
her
hand,
that,
without
knowing
what
she
did,
she
accepted
him.
He
walked
away
again
immediately,
and
she
was
left
to
fret
over
her
own
want
of
presence
of
mind;
Charlotte
tried
to
console
