"My
dear
Emma,"
said
he
at
last,
with
earnest
kindness,
"do
you
think
you
perfectly
understand
the
degree
of
acquaintance
between
the
gentleman
and
lady
we
have
been
speaking
of?"
"Between
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
Miss

to
find
that
you
can
vouchsafe
to
let
your
imagination
wander
but
it
will
not
do
very
sorry
to
check
you
in
your
first
essay
but
indeed
it
will
not
do.
There
is
no
admiration
between
them,
I

and

appearances
which
