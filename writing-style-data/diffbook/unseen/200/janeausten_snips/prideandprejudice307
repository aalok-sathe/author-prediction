from
the
evening's
scrutiny,
that
though
she
received
his
attentions
with
pleasure,
she
did
not
invite
them
by
any
participation
of
sentiment.
If
you
have
not
been
mistaken
here,
I
must
have
been
in
error.
Your
superior
knowledge
of
your
sister
must
make
the
latter
probable.
If
it
be
so,
if
I
have
been
misled
by
such
error
to
inflict
pain
on
her,
your
resentment
has
not
been
unreasonable.
But
I
shall
not
scruple
to
assert,
that
the
serenity
of
your
sister's
countenance
and
air
was
such
as
might
have
given
the
most
acute
observer
a
conviction
that,
however
amiable
her
temper,
her
heart
was
not
likely
to
be
easily
touched.
That
I
was
desirous
of
believing
her
indifferent
is
certain
but
I
will
venture
to
say
that
my
investigation
and
decisions
are
not
usually
influenced
by
my
hopes
or
fears.
I
did
not
believe
her
to
be
indifferent
because
I
wished
it;
I
believed
it
on
impartial
conviction,
as
truly
as
I
wished
it
in
reason.
My
objections
to
the
marriage
were
not
merely
those
which
I
last
night
acknowledged
to
have
the
utmost
force
of
passion
to
put
aside,
in
my
own
case;
the
want
of
connection
