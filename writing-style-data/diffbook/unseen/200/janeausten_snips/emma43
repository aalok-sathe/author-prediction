I
know,
indeed,
that
he
is
so,
and,
as
such,
wish
him
well.
What
do
you
imagine
his
age
to
be?"
"He
was
four
and
twenty
the
8th
of
last
June,
and
my
birthday
is
the
23rd
just
a
fortnight
and
a
day's
difference
which
is
very
odd."
"Only
four

That
is
too
young

His
mother
is
perfectly
right
not

he
would
be
thirty
years
old!"
"Well,
and
that
is
as
early
as
most
men
can
afford
to
marry,
who
are
not
born
to
an
independence.
Mr.
Martin,
I
imagine,
has
his
fortune
entirely
to
make

be
at
all

with
the
world.
Whatever
money
he
might
come
into
when
his
father
died,
whatever
his
share
of
the
family
property,
it
is,
I
dare
