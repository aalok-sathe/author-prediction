on
mine;
and
I
returned
the
same
evening
to
Richmond,
though
I
might
have
staid
with
you
till
the
next
morning,
merely
because
I
would
be
as
angry
with
her
as
possible.
Even
then,
I
was
not
such
a
fool
as
not
to
mean
to
be
reconciled
in
time;
but
I
was
the
injured
person,
injured
by
her
coldness,
and
I
went
away
determined
that
she
should
make
the
first
advances.
I
shall
always
congratulate
myself
that
you
were
not
of
the
Box
Hill
party.
Had
you
witnessed
my
behaviour
there,
I
can
hardly
suppose
you
would
ever
have
thought
well
of
me
again.
Its
effect
upon
her
appears
in
the
immediate
resolution
it
produced:
as
soon
as
she
found
I
was
really
gone
from
Randalls,
she
closed
with
the
offer
of
that
officious
Mrs.
Elton;
the
whole
system
of
whose
treatment
of
her,
by
the
bye,
has
ever
filled
me
with
indignation
and
hatred.
I
must
not
quarrel
with
a
spirit
of
forbearance
which
has
been
so
richly
extended
towards
myself;
but,
otherwise,
I
should
loudly
protest
against
the
share
of
it
which
that
woman
has
known.
'Jane,'
indeed!
You
will
observe
that
I
have
not
yet
indulged
myself
