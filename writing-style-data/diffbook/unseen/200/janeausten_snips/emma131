They
are
very
fond
of
being
at
Hartfield,
Harriet."
"I
dare
say
they
are,
sir.
I
am
sure
I
do
not
know
who
is
not."
"Henry
is
a
fine
boy,
but
John
is
very
like
his
mama.
Henry
is
the
eldest,
he
was
named
after
me,
not
after
his

John,
the
second,
is
named
after

Some
people
are
surprized,

were
only
made
for
grandpapas.
I
think
their
father
is
too
rough
with
them
very
often."
"He
appears
rough
to
you,"
said
Emma,
"because
you
are
so
very
gentle
yourself;
but
if
you
could
compare
him
with
other
papas,
you
would
not
think
him
rough.
He
wishes
his
boys
to
be
active

hardy;
and

they
