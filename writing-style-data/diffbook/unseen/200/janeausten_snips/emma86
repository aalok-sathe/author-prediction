to
her,
for
the
clownish
manner
which
might
be
offending
her
every
hour
of
the
day,
to
know
that
her
husband
could
write
a
good
letter."
"Oh!
yes,
very.
Nobody
cares
for
a
letter;
the
thing
is,
to
be
always
happy
with
pleasant
companions.
I
am
quite
determined
to
refuse
him.
But
how
shall
I
do?
What
shall
I
say?"
Emma
assured
her
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
the
answer,
and
advised
its
being
written
directly,
which
was
agreed
to,
in
the
hope
of
her
assistance;
and
though
Emma
continued
to
protest
against
any
assistance
being
wanted,
it
was
in
fact
given
in
the
formation
of
every
sentence.
The
looking
over
his
letter
again,
in
replying
to
it,
had
such
a
softening
tendency,
that
it
was
particularly
necessary
to
brace
her
up
with
a
few
decisive
expressions;
and
she
was
so
very
much
concerned
at
the
idea
of
making
him
unhappy,
and
thought
so
much
of
what
his
mother
and
sisters
would
think
and
say,
and
was
so
anxious
that
they
should
not
fancy
her
ungrateful,
that
Emma
believed
if
the
young
man
had
come
in
her
way
at
that
moment,
he
would
have
been
accepted
after
all.
