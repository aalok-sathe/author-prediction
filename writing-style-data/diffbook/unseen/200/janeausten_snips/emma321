oftener
than
Emma
could
have
supposed.
Some
of
the
objects
of
his
curiosity
spoke
very
amiable
feelings.
He
begged
to
be
shewn
the
house
which
his
father
had
lived
in
so
long,
and
which
had
been
the
home
of
his
father's
father;
and
on
recollecting
that
an
old
woman
who
had
nursed
him
was
still
living,
walked
in
quest
of
her
cottage
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other;
and
though
in
some
points
of
pursuit
or
observation
there
was
no
positive
merit,
they
shewed,
altogether,
a
good
will
towards
Highbury
in
general,
which
must
be
very
like
a
merit
to
those
he
was
with.
Emma
watched
and
decided,
that
with
such
feelings
as
were
now
shewn,
it
could
not
be
fairly
supposed
that
he
had
been
ever
voluntarily
absenting
himself;
that
he
had
not
been
acting
a
part,
or
making
a
parade
of
insincere
professions;
and
that
Mr.
Knightley
certainly
had
not
done
him
justice.
Their
first
pause
was
at
the
Crown
Inn,
an
inconsiderable
house,
though
the
principal
one
of
the
sort,
where
a
couple
of
pair
of
post
horses
were
kept,
more
for
the
convenience
of
the
neighbourhood
than
from
any
run
on
the
road;
