her
nieces,
turned
the
conversation.
When
alone
with
Elizabeth
afterwards,
she
spoke
more
on
the
subject.
"It
seems
likely
to
have
been
a
desirable
match
for
Jane,"
said
she.
"I
am
sorry
it
went
off.
But
these
things
happen
so
often!
A
young
man,
such
as
you
describe
Mr.
Bingley,
so
easily
falls
in
love
with
a
pretty
girl
for
a
few
weeks,
and
when
accident
separates
them,
so
easily
forgets
her,
that
these
sort
of
inconsistencies
are
very
frequent."
"An
excellent
consolation
in
its
way,"
said
Elizabeth,
"but
it
will
not
do
for
us.
We
do
not
suffer
by
accident.
It
does
not
often
happen
that
the
interference
of
friends
will
persuade
a
young
man
of
independent
fortune
to
think
no
more
of
a
girl
whom
he
was
violently
in
love
with
only
a
few
days
before."
"But
that
expression
of
'violently
in
love'
is
so
hackneyed,
so
doubtful,
so
indefinite,
that
it
gives
me
very
little
idea.
It
is
as
often
applied
to
feelings
which
arise
from
a
half
hour's
acquaintance,
as
to
a
real,
strong
attachment.
Pray,
how
violent
was
Mr.
Bingley's
love?"
"I
never
saw
a
more
promising
inclination;
he
was
growing
quite
inattentive
