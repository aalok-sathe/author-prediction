man
might
be
feeling!
It
was
too
wretched!
Such
a
delightful
evening
as
it
would
have
been!
Every
body
so
happy!
and
she
and
her
partner
the
happiest!
"I
said
it
would
be
so,"
was
the
only
consolation.
Her
father's
feelings
were
quite
distinct.
He
thought
principally
of
Mrs.
Churchill's
illness,
and
wanted
to
know
how
she
was
treated;

for
the
first
few
minutes;
and
when
rousing
himself,
it
was
only
to
say,
"Of
all
horrid
things,
leave
taking
is
the
worst."
"But
you
will
come
again,"
said
Emma.
"This
will
not
be
your
only
visit
to
Randalls."
"Ah!
(shaking
his
head)

uncertainty
of
