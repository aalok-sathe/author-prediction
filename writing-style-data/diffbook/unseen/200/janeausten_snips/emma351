dear
part
of
Emma,
her
fancy,
received
an
amusing
supply.
Mrs.
Cole
was
telling
that
she
had
been
calling
on
Miss
Bates,
and
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
had
been
struck
by
the
sight
of
a
pianoforte
a
very
elegant
looking
instrument
not
a
grand,
but
a
large
sized
square
pianoforte;
and
the
substance
of
the
story,
the
end
of
all
the
dialogue
which
ensued
of
surprize,
and
inquiry,
and
congratulations
on
her
side,
and
explanations
on
Miss
Bates's,
was,
that
this
pianoforte
had
arrived
from
Broadwood's
the
day
before,
to
the
great
astonishment
of
both
aunt
and
niece
entirely
unexpected;
that
at
first,
by
Miss
Bates's
account,
Jane
herself
was
quite
at
a
loss,
quite
bewildered
to
think
who
could
possibly
have
ordered
it
but
now,
they
were
both
perfectly
satisfied
that
it
could
be
from
only
one
quarter;
of
course
it
must
be
from
Colonel
Campbell.
"One
can
suppose
nothing
else,"
added
Mrs.
Cole,
"and
I
was
only
surprized
that
there
could
ever
have
been
a
doubt.
But
Jane,
it
seems,
had
a
letter
from
them
very
lately,
and
not
a
word
was
said
about
it.
She
knows
their
ways
best;
but
I
should
not
consider
