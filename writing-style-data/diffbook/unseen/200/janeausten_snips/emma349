we
should
arrive
at
the
same
moment!
for,
if
we
had
met
first
in
the
drawing
room,
I
doubt
whether
you
would
have
discerned
me
to
be
more
of
a
gentleman
than
usual.
You
might
not
have
distinguished
how
I
came,
by
my

or

else.
Now
I
shall
really
be
very
happy
to
walk
into
the
same
room
with
you."
"Nonsensical
girl!"
was
his
reply,
but
not
at
all
in
anger.
Emma
had
as
much
reason
