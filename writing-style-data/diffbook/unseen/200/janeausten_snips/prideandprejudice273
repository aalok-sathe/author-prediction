"Perhaps,"
said
Darcy,
"I
should
have
judged
better,
had
I
sought
an
introduction;
but
I
am
ill
qualified
to
recommend
myself
to
strangers."
"Shall
we
ask
your
cousin
the
reason
of
this?"
said
Elizabeth,
still
addressing
Colonel
Fitzwilliam.
"Shall
we
ask
him
why
a
man
of
sense
and
education,
and
who
has
lived
in
the
world,
is
ill
qualified
to
recommend
himself
to
strangers?"
"I
can
answer
your
question,"
said
Fitzwilliam,
"without
applying
to
him.
It
is
because
he
will
not
give
himself
the
trouble."
"I
certainly
have
not
the
talent
which
some
people
possess,"
said
Darcy,
"of
conversing
easily
with
those
I
have
never
seen
before.
I
cannot
catch
their
tone
of
conversation,
or
appear
interested
in
their
concerns,
as
I
often
see
done."
"My
fingers,"
said
Elizabeth,
"do
not
move
over
this
instrument
in
the
masterly
manner
which
I
see
so
many
women's
do.
They
have
not
the
same
force
or
rapidity,
and
do
not
produce
the
same
expression.
But
then
I
have
always
supposed
it
to
be
my
own
fault
because
I
will
not
take
the
trouble
of
practising.
It
is
not
that
I
do
not
believe
my
fingers
as
capable
as
any
other
woman's
of
superior
