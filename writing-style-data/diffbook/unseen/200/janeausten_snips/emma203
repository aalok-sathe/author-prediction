a
sofa.
He
joined
them
immediately,
and,
with
scarcely
an
invitation,
seated
himself
between
them.
Emma,
in
good
spirits
too,
from
the
amusement
afforded
her
mind
by
the
expectation
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill,
was
willing
to
forget
his
late
improprieties,
and
be
as
well
satisfied
with
him
as
before,
and
on
his
making
Harriet
his
very
first
subject,
was
ready
to
listen
with
most
friendly
smiles.
He
professed
himself
extremely
anxious
about
her
fair
friend
her
fair,
lovely,
amiable
friend.
"Did
she
know?
had
she
heard
any
thing
about
her,
since
their
being
at
Randalls?
he
felt
much
anxiety
he
must
confess
that
the
nature
of
her
complaint
alarmed
him
considerably."
And
in
this
style
he
talked
on
for
some
time
very
properly,
not
much
attending
to
any
answer,
but
altogether
sufficiently
awake
to
the
terror
of
a
bad
sore
throat;
and
Emma
was
quite
in
charity
with
him.
But
at
last
there
seemed
a
perverse
turn;
it
seemed
all
at
once
as
if
he
were
more
afraid
of
its
being
a
bad
sore
throat
on
her
account,
than
on
Harriet's
more
anxious
that
she
should
escape
the
infection,
than
that
there
should
be
no
infection
in
the
complaint.
