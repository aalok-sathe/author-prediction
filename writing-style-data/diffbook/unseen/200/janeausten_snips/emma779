that
every
body
knows
them.
Only
let
me
be
told
when
I
may
speak
out.
I
wonder
whether
Jane
has
any
suspicion."
He
went
to
Highbury
the
next
morning,
and
satisfied
himself
on
that
point.
He
told
her
the
news.
Was
not
she
like
a
daughter,
his
eldest
daughter?
he
must
tell
her;
and
Miss
Bates

It
was
no
more

Donwell,
and
leaving
Hartfield
for
the
John
Knightleys;
and
another
might
predict
disagreements
among
their
servants;
but
yet,
upon
the
whole,
there
was
no
serious
objection
raised,
except
in
one
habitation,
the
Vicarage.
There,
the
surprize
was
not
softened
by
any
satisfaction.
Mr.
