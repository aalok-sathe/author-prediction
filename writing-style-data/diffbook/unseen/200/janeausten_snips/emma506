will
not
be
second
to
any
lady
in
the
land
for"
Mrs.
Elton
eagerly
interposed
with,
"Oh!
Mr.
Weston,
do
not
mistake
me.
Selina
is
no
fine
lady,
I
assure
you.
Do
not
run
away
with
such
an
idea."
"Is
not
she?
Then
she
is
no
rule
for
Mrs.
Churchill,
who
is
as
thorough
a
fine
lady
as
any
body
ever
beheld."
Mrs.
Elton
began
to
think
she
had
been
wrong
in
disclaiming
so
warmly.
It

of
Frank,
and
therefore
I
would
not
speak
ill
of
her.
Besides,
she
is
out
of
health
now;
but
that
indeed,
by
her
own
account,
she
has
always
been.
I
would
not
say
so
to
every
body,
Mrs.
Elton,
but
I
have
not
much
faith
in
Mrs.
Churchill's
illness."
"If
she
is
