for
any
thing
was
welcome
that
might
justify
their
all
three
being
quite
asunder
at
present.
The
weather
was
most
favourable
for
her;
though
Christmas
Day,
she
could
not
go
to
church.
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
have
been
miserable
had
his
daughter
attempted
it,
and
she
was
therefore
safe
from
either
exciting
or
receiving
unpleasant
and
most
unsuitable
ideas.
The
ground
covered
with
snow,
and
the
atmosphere

that
unsettled
state
between

is
of
all

excuses
for
Mr.
Elton's
absenting
himself.
It
was
weather
which
might
fairly
confine
every
body
at
home;
and
though
she
hoped
and
believed
him
to
be
really
taking
comfort
in
some
society
or
other,
it
was
very
pleasant
to
have
her
father
so
well
satisfied
with
his
being
all
alone
in
his
own
house,
too
wise
to
stir
out;
and
to
hear
him
say
to
Mr.
Knightley,
