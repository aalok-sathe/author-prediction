Here
is
your
tippet.
Mrs.
Weston
begs
you
to
put
on
your
tippet.
She
says
she
is
afraid
there
will
be
draughts
in
the
passage,
though
every
thing
has
been
done
One
door
nailed
up
Quantities
of
matting
My
dear
Jane,
indeed
you
must.
Mr.
Churchill,
oh!
you
are
too
obliging!
How
well
you
put
it
on!
so
gratified!
Excellent
dancing
indeed!
Yes,
my
dear,
I
ran
home,
as
I
said
I
should,
to
help
grandmama
to
bed,
and
got
back
again,
and
nobody
missed
me.
I
set
off
without
saying
a
word,
just
as
I
told
you.
Grandmama
was
quite
well,
had
a
charming
evening
with
Mr.
Woodhouse,
a
vast
deal
of
chat,
and
backgammon.
Tea
was
made
downstairs,
biscuits
and
baked
apples
and
wine
before
she
came
away:
amazing
luck
in
some
of
her
throws:
and
she
inquired
a
great
deal
about
you,
how
you
were
amused,
and
who
were
your
partners.
'Oh!'
said
I,
'I
shall
not
forestall
Jane;
I
left
her
dancing
with
Mr.
George
Otway;
she
will
love
to
tell
you
all
about
it
herself
to
morrow:
her
first
partner
was
Mr.
Elton,
I
do
not
know
who
will
ask
her
next,
perhaps
Mr.
William
