Emma
could
not
get
rid
of,
and
which
constituted
the
real
misery
of
the
business
to
her.
Frank
Churchill
had
behaved
very
ill
by
herself
very
ill
in
many
ways,
but
it
was
not
so
much
his
behaviour
as
her
own,
which
made
her
so
angry
with
him.
It
was
the
scrape
which
he
had
drawn
her
into
on
Harriet's
account,
that
gave
the
deepest
hue
to
his
offence.
Poor
Harriet!
to
be
a
second
time
the
dupe
of
her
misconceptions
and
flattery.
Mr.
Knightley
had
spoken
prophetically,
when
he
once
said,
"Emma,
you
have
been
no
friend
to
Harriet
Smith."
She
was
afraid
she
had
done
her
nothing
but
disservice.
It
was
true
that
she
had
not
to
charge
herself,
in
this
instance
as
in
the
former,
with
being
the
sole
and
original
author
of
the
mischief;
with
having
suggested
such
feelings
as
might
otherwise
never
have
entered
Harriet's
imagination;
for
Harriet
had
acknowledged
her
admiration
and
preference
of
Frank
Churchill
before
she
had
ever
given
her
a
hint
on
the
subject;
but
she
felt
completely
guilty
of
having
encouraged
what
she
might
have
repressed.
She
might
have
prevented
the
indulgence
and
increase
of
such
sentiments.
Her
influence
would
