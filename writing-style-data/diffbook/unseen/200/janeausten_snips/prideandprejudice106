settled
choice.
The
next
morning,
however,
made
an
alteration;
for
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour's
tete
a
tete
with
Mrs.
Bennet
before
breakfast,
a
conversation
beginning
with
his
parsonage
house,
and
leading
naturally
to
the
avowal
of
his
hopes,
that
a
mistress
might
be
found
for
it
at
Longbourn,
produced
from
her,
amid
very
complaisant
smiles
and
general
encouragement,
a
caution
against
the
very
Jane
he
had
fixed
on.
"As
to
her
younger
daughters,
she
could
not
take
upon
her
to
say
she
could
not
positively
answer
but
she
did
not
know
of
any
prepossession;
her
eldest
daughter,
she
must
just
mention
she
felt
it
incumbent
on
her
to
hint,
was
likely
to
be
very
soon
engaged."
Mr.
Collins
had
only
to
change
from
Jane
to
Elizabeth
and
it
was
soon
done
done
while
Mrs.
Bennet
was
stirring
the
fire.
Elizabeth,
equally
next
to
Jane
in
birth
and
beauty,
succeeded
her
of
course.
Mrs.
Bennet
treasured
up
the
hint,
and
trusted
that
she
might
soon
have
two
daughters
married;
and
the
man
whom
she
could
not
bear
to
speak
of
the
day
before
was
now
high
in
her
good
graces.
