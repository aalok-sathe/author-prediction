give
me
a
chance
of
being
right,
if
we
think
differently."
"I
have
still
the
advantage
of
you
by
sixteen
years'
experience,
and
by
not
being
a
pretty
young
woman
and
a
spoiled
child.
Come,
my
dear
Emma,
let
us
be
friends,
and
say
no
more
about
it.
Tell
your
aunt,
little
Emma,
that
she
ought
to
set
you
a
better
example
than
to
be
renewing
old
grievances,
and

if
she
were
not
wrong
before,

"That's

she
cried
"very

of
the
argument
have
yet
proved
wrong.
I
only
want
to
know
that
Mr.
Martin
is
not
very,
very
bitterly
disappointed."
"A
man
cannot
be
more
so,"
was
his
short,
full
answer.
"Ah!
Indeed
I
am
very
sorry.
Come,
shake
hands
with
me."
This
had
just
taken
place
and
with
great
cordiality,
when
John
Knightley
made
his
appearance,
and
"How
d'ye
do,
George?"
and
"John,
