brought
the
next
visit
from
Isabella
and
her
husband,
and
their
little
children,
to
fill
the
house,
and
give
her
pleasant
society
again.
Highbury,
the
large
and
populous
village,
almost
amounting
to
a
town,
to
which
Hartfield,
in
spite
of
its
separate
lawn,
and
shrubberies,
and
name,
did
really
belong,
afforded
her
no
equals.
The
Woodhouses
were
first
in
consequence
there.
All
looked
up

She
had
many
acquaintance
in
the

could
be
accepted
in

Miss
Taylor

and
wish

impossible
things,
till
her
father
awoke,
and
made
it
necessary
to
be

spirits
required
support.
He
was
a
nervous
man,
easily
depressed;
fond
of
every
body
that
he
was
used
to,
and
hating
to
part
with
them;
hating
change
of
every
kind.
Matrimony,
as
the
origin
of
change,
was
always
disagreeable;
and
he
was
by
no
means
yet
reconciled
to
his
own
daughter's
marrying,
nor
could
ever
speak
of
her
but
with
compassion,
though
it
had
been
entirely
a
match
of
affection,
