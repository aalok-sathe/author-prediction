dreaded
being
quarrelsome;
her
heroism
reached
only
to
silence.
She
allowed
him
to
talk,
and
arranged
the
glasses,
and
wrapped
herself
up,
without
opening
her
lips.
They
arrived,
the
carriage
turned,
the
step
was
let
down,
and
Mr.
Elton,
spruce,
black,
and
smiling,
was
with
them
instantly.
Emma
thought
with
pleasure
of
some
change
of
subject.
Mr.
Elton
was
all
obligation
and
cheerfulness;
he
was
so
very
cheerful
in
his
civilities
indeed,
that
she
began
to
think
he
must
have
received
a
different
account
of
Harriet
from
what
had
reached
her.
She
had
sent
while
dressing,
and
the
answer
had
been,
"Much
the
same
not
better."
"My
report
from
Mrs.
Goddard's,"
said
she
presently,
"was
not
so
pleasant
as
I
had
hoped
'Not
better'
was
my
answer."
His
face
lengthened
immediately;
and
his
voice
was
the
voice
of
sentiment
as
he
answered.
"Oh!
no
I
am
grieved
to
find
I
was
on
the
point
of
telling
you
that
when
I
called
at
Mrs.
Goddard's
door,
which
I
did
the
very
last
thing
before
I
returned
to
dress,
I
was
told
that
Miss
Smith
was
not
better,
by
no
means
better,
rather
worse.
Very
much
grieved
and
concerned
I
had
flattered
