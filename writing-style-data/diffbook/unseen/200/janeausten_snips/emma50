"Will

indeed?
That
will
be
very
bad."
"How
much
his
business
engrosses
him
already
is
very
plain
from
the
circumstance
of
his
forgetting
to
inquire
for
the
book
you
recommended.
He
was
a

Her

beginning
was,
"In

Mr.
Knightley's
or
Mr.
Weston's.
They
have
more
gentleness.
They
might
be
more
safely
held
up
as
a
pattern.
There
is
an
openness,
a
quickness,
almost
a
bluntness
in
Mr.
Weston,
which
every
