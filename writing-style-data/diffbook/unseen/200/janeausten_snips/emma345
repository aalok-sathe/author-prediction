bilious.
No,
I
would
not
be
the
means
of
giving
them
any
pain.
My
dear
Emma,
we
must
consider
this.
I
am
sure,
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
hurting
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cole,
you
would
stay
a
little
longer
than
you
might
wish.

at
your
usual
time
and
the
idea
of
that
would
entirely
destroy
my
comfort.
You
must
promise
me
not
to
sit
up."
He
did,
on
the
condition
of
some
promises
on
her
side:
such
as
that,
if
she
came
home
cold,
she
would
be
sure
to
warm

if
hungry,
that
she
would
take
something
to
eat;
that
her
own
maid
should
