everybody
as
happy?"
Elizabeth's
congratulations
were
given
with
a
sincerity,
a
warmth,
a
delight,
which
words
could
but
poorly
express.
Every
sentence
of
kindness
was
a
fresh
source
of
happiness
to
Jane.
But
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
stay
with
her
sister,
or
say

months
of
suspense
and
vexation.

said
she,
"is
