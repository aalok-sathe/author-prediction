confess
myself
to
have
been
entirely
deceived
in
Miss
Bingley's
regard
for
me.
But,
my
dear
sister,
though
the
event
has
proved
you
right,
do
not
think
me
obstinate
if
I
still
assert
that,
considering
what
her
behaviour
was,
my
confidence
was
as
natural
as
your
suspicion.
I

comprehend
her
reason

see
me
again,
and
was
in
every
respect
so
altered
a
creature,
that
when
she
went
away
I
was
perfectly
resolved
to
continue
the
acquaintance
no
longer.
I
pity,
though
I
cannot
help
blaming
her.
She
was
very
wrong
in
singling
me
out
as
she
did;
I
can
safely
say
that
every
advance
to
intimacy

her
side.
But
I
pity
