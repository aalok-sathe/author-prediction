"'Tis
an
etiquette
I
despise,"
said
he.
"If
he
wants
our
society,
let
him
seek
it.
He
knows
where
we
live.
I
will
not
spend
my
hours
in
running
after
my
neighbours
every
time
they
go
away
and
come
back
again."
"Well,
all
I

before

did.
As
the
day
of
his
arrival
drew
near,
"I
begin
to
be
sorry
that
he
comes
at
all,"
said
Jane
to
her
sister.
"It
would
be
nothing;
I
could
see
him
with
perfect
indifference,
but
I
can
hardly
bear
to
hear
it
thus
perpetually
talked
of.
My
mother

well;
but
she
