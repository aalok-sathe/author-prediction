He
brought
all
the
music
to
her,
and
they
looked
it
over
together.
Emma
took
the
opportunity
of
whispering,
"You
speak
too
plain.
She
must
understand
you."
"I
hope
she
does.
I
would
have
her
understand
me.
I
am
not
in
the

ashamed
of
my
meaning."
"But

I
am

had
never
taken

the

"I
am

you
did,
and
that
you

I
have
now
a
key
to
all
her
odd
looks
and

at
this
moment
his
favourite."
Shortly
afterwards
Miss

passing
near
the
window,
descried
Mr.
Knightley
on
horse
back
not
far
off.
"Mr.
Knightley
I
declare!
I
must
speak
to
him
if
possible,
just
to
thank
him.
I
will
not
open
the
window
here;
it
would
give
you
all
cold;
but
I
can
go

know.
I

Quite
