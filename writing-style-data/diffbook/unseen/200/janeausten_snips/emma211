a
much
darker
night
than
he
had
been
prepared
for.
"He
was
afraid
they
should
have
a
very
bad
drive.
He
was
afraid
poor
Isabella
would
not
like
it.
And
there
would
be
poor
Emma
in
the
carriage
behind.
He
did
not
know
what
they
had
best
do.
They
must
keep
as
much
together
as
they
could;"
and
James
was
talked
to,
and
given
a
charge
to
go
very
slow
and
wait
for
the
other
carriage.
Isabella
stept
in
after
her
father;
John
Knightley,
forgetting
that
he
did
not
belong
to
their
party,
stept
in
after
his
wife
very
naturally;
so
that
Emma
found,
on
being
escorted
and
followed
into
the
second
carriage
by
Mr.
Elton,
that
the
door
was
to
be
lawfully
shut
on
them,
and
that
they
were
to
have
a
tete
a
tete
drive.
It
would
not
have
been
the
awkwardness
of
a
moment,
it
would
have
been
rather
a
pleasure,
previous
to
the
suspicions
of
this
very
day;
she
could
have
talked
to
him
of
Harriet,
and
the
three
quarters
of
a
mile
would
have
seemed
but
one.
But
now,
she
would
rather
it
had
not
happened.
She
believed
he
had
been
drinking
too
much
of
