long.
A
few
minutes
made
Emma
acquainted
with
the
whole.
Miss
Smith,
and
Miss
Bickerton,
another
parlour
boarder
at
Mrs.
Goddard's,
who
had
been
also
at
the
ball,
had
walked
out
together,
and
taken
a
road,
the
Richmond
road,
which,
though
apparently
public
enough
for
safety,
had
led
them
into
alarm.
About
half
a
mile
beyond
Highbury,
making
a
sudden
turn,
and
deeply
shaded
by
elms
on
each
side,
it
became
for
a
considerable
stretch
very
retired;
and
when
the
young
ladies
had
advanced
some

and
Miss

gave
a
great
scream,
and
calling
on
Harriet
to
follow
her,
ran
up
a
steep
bank,
cleared
a
slight
hedge
at
the
top,
and
made
the
best
of
her
way
by
a
short
cut
back
to
Highbury.
But
poor
Harriet
could
not
follow.
She
had
suffered
very
much
from
cramp
after
dancing,
and
her
first
attempt
to
mount
the
bank
brought
on
such
a
return
of
it
as
made
her
absolutely
powerless
