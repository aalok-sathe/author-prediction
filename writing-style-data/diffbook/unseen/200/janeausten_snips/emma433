the
conclusion
of
every
imaginary
declaration
on
his
side
was
that
she
refused
him.
Their
affection
was
always
to
subside
into
friendship.
Every
thing
tender
and
charming
was
to
mark
their
parting;
but
still
they
were
to
part.
When
she
became
sensible
of
this,
it

her
that
she
could
not
be
very
much

I
do.
I
am
quite
enough
in
love.
I
should
be
sorry
to
be
more."
Upon
the
whole,
she
was
equally
contented
with
her
view
of
his
feelings.
"He
is
undoubtedly
very
