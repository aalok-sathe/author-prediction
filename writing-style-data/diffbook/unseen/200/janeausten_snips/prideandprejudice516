know.
Do
not
let
us
quarrel
about
the
past.
In
future,
I
hope
we
shall
be
always
of
one
mind."
She
held
out
her
hand;
he
kissed
it
with
affectionate
gallantry,
though
he
hardly
knew
how
to
look,
and
they
entered
the
house.
Mr.
Wickham
was
so
perfectly
satisfied
with
this
conversation
that
he
never
again
distressed
himself,
or
provoked
his
dear
sister
Elizabeth,
by
introducing
the
subject
of
it;
and
she
was
pleased
to
find
that
she

of
their

twelvemonth.
"Oh!

dear
Lydia,"
she
cried,
"when
shall
we
meet
again?"
"Oh,
lord!
I
don't
know.
Not
these
two
or
three
years,
perhaps."
"Write
to
me
very
often,
my
dear."
"As
often
as
I
can.
But
you
know
married
women
have
never
much
time
for
writing.
My
sisters
may
write
to
me.
They
will
have
nothing
else
to
do."
Mr.
Wickham's
adieus
were
much

his
wife's.
He
