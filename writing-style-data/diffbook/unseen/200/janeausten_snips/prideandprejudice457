discomposed,
that
I
had
difficulty
in
finding
out
even
so
much
as
this."
The
whole
party
were
in
hopes
of
a
letter
from
Mr.
Bennet
the
next
morning,
but
the
post
came
in
without
bringing
a
single
line
from
him.
His
family
knew
him
to
be,
on
all
common
occasions,
a
most
negligent
and
dilatory
correspondent;
but
at
such
a
time
they
had
hoped
for

They
were

to
conclude
that

to
Longbourn,
as
soon
as
he
could,
to
the
great
consolation
of
his
sister,
who
considered
it
as
the
only
security
for
her
husband's
not
being
killed
in
a
duel.
Mrs.
Gardiner
and
the
children
were
to
remain
in
Hertfordshire
a
few
days
longer,
as
the
former
thought
her
presence
might
be
serviceable
to
her
nieces.
She
shared
in
their
attendance
on
Mrs.
Bennet,
and
