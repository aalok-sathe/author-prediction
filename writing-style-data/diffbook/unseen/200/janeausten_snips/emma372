does
nothing
mysteriously."
"I
have
heard
him
lamenting
her
having
no
instrument
repeatedly;
oftener
than
I
should
suppose
such
a
circumstance
would,
in
the
common
course
of
things,
occur
to
him."
"Very
well;
and
if
he
had
intended
to
give
her
one,
he
would
have
told
her
so."
"There
might
be
scruples
of
delicacy,
my
dear
Emma.
I
have
a
very
strong
notion

Jane
Fairfax."
They
combated
the
point
some
time
longer
in
the
same
way;
Emma
rather
gaining
ground
over
the
mind
of
her
friend;
for
Mrs.
Weston
was
the
most
used
of
the
two
to
yield;
till
a
little
bustle
in
the
room
shewed
them
that
tea
was
over,
and
the
instrument
in
preparation;
and
at
the
same
moment
Mr.
Cole
approaching
to
