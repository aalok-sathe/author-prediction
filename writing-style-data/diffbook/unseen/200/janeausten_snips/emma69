kindest
friend
on
every
occasion.
She
would
sit
whenever
I
asked
her.
There
is
my
sister;
and
really
quite
her
own
little
elegant
figure!
and
the
face
not
unlike.
I
should
have
made
a
good
likeness
of
her,
if
she
would
have
sat
longer,
but
she
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
have
me
draw
her
four
children
that
she
would
not
be
quiet.
Then,
here
come
all
my
attempts
at
three
of
those
four
children;
there
they
are,
Henry
and
John
and
Bella,
from
one
end
of
the
sheet
to
the
other,
and
any
one
of
them
might
do
for
any
one
of
the
rest.
She
was
so
eager
to
have
them
drawn
that
I
could
not
refuse;
but
there
is
no
making
children
of
three
or
four
years
old
stand
still
you
know;
nor
can
it
be
very
easy
to
take
any
likeness
of
them,
beyond
the
air
and
complexion,
unless
they
are
coarser
featured
than
any
of
mama's
children
ever
were.
Here
is
my
sketch
of
the
fourth,
who
was
a
baby.
I
took
him
as
he
was
sleeping
on
the
sofa,
and
it
is
as
strong
a
likeness
of
his
cockade
as
you
would
wish
to
