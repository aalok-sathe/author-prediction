and
was
grateful.
This
point
was
just
arranged,
when
a
visitor
arrived
to
tear
Emma's
thoughts
a
little
from
the
one
subject
which
had
engrossed
them,
sleeping
or
waking,
the
last
twenty
four
hours
Mrs.
Weston,
who
had
been
calling
on
her
daughter
in
law
elect,
and
took
Hartfield
in
her
way
home,
almost
as
much
in
duty
to
Emma
as
in
pleasure
to
herself,
to
relate
all
the
particulars
of
so
interesting
an
interview.
Mr.
Weston
had
accompanied
her
to
Mrs.
Bates's,
and
gone
through
his
share
of
this
essential
attention
most
handsomely;
but
she
having
then
induced
Miss
Fairfax
to
join
her
in
an
airing,
was
now
returned
with
much
more
to
say,
and
much
more
to
say
with
satisfaction,
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
spent
in
Mrs.
Bates's
parlour,
with
all
the
encumbrance
of
awkward
feelings,
could
have
afforded.
A
little
curiosity
Emma
had;
and
she
made
the
most
of
it
while
her
friend
related.
Mrs.
Weston
had
set
off
to
pay
the
visit
in
a
good
deal
of
agitation
herself;
and
in
the
first
place
had
wished
not
to
go
at
all
at
present,
to
be
allowed
merely
to
write
to
Miss
Fairfax
instead,
and
