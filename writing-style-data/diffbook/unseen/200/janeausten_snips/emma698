made
a
subject
of
material
distress
to
the
delicacy
of
Jane's
feelings,
by
the
levity
or
carelessness
of
Frank
Churchill's.
Of
all
the
sources
of
evil
surrounding
the
former,
since
her
coming
to
Highbury,
she
was
persuaded
that
she
must
herself
have
been
the
worst.
She
must
have
been
a
perpetual
enemy.
They
never
could
have
been
all
three
together,
without
her
having
stabbed
Jane
Fairfax's
peace
in
a
thousand
instances;
and
on
Box
Hill,
perhaps,
it
had
been
the
agony
of
a
mind
that
would
bear
no
more.
The
evening
of
this
day
was
very
long,
and
melancholy,
at
Hartfield.
The
weather
added
what
it
could
of
gloom.
A
cold
stormy
rain
set
in,
and
nothing
of
July
appeared
but
in
the
trees
and
shrubs,
which
the
wind
was
despoiling,
and
the
length
of
the
day,
which
only
made
such
cruel
sights
the
longer
visible.
The
weather
affected
Mr.
Woodhouse,
and
he
could
only
be
kept
tolerably
comfortable
by
almost
ceaseless
attention
on
his
daughter's
side,
and
by
exertions
which
had
never
cost
her
half
so
much
before.
It
reminded
her
of
their
first
forlorn
tete
a
tete,
on
the
evening
of
Mrs.
Weston's
wedding
day;
