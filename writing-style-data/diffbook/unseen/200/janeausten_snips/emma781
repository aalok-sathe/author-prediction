A
few
more
to
morrows,
and
the
party
from
London
would
be
arriving.
It
was
an
alarming
change;
and
Emma
was
thinking
of
it
one
morning,
as
what
must
bring
a
great
deal
to
agitate
and
grieve
her,
when
Mr.
Knightley
came
in,
and
distressing
thoughts
were
put
by.
After
the
first
chat
of
pleasure
he
was
silent;
and
then,
in
a
graver
tone,
began
with,
"I
have
something
to
tell
you,
Emma;
some
news."
"Good
or
bad?"
said
she,
quickly,
looking
up
in
his
face.
"I
do
not
know
which
it
ought
to
be
called."
"Oh!
good
I
am
sure.
I
see
it
in
your
countenance.
You
are
trying
not
to
smile."
"I
am
afraid,"
said
he,
composing
his
features,
"I
am
very
much
afraid,
my
dear
Emma,
that
you
will
not
smile
when
you
hear
it."
"Indeed!
but
why
so?
I
can
hardly
imagine
that
any
thing
which
pleases
or
amuses
you,
should
not
please
and
amuse
me
too."
"There
is
one
subject,"
he
replied,
"I
hope
but
one,
on
which
we
do
not
think
alike."
He
paused
a
moment,
again
smiling,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
face.
"Does
nothing
occur
to
you?
Do
not
you
recollect?
