soon
found
that
he
was
not
held
there
in
much
estimation;
for
though
the
chief
of
his
concerns
with
the
son
of
his
patron
were
imperfectly
understood,
it
was
yet
a
well
known
fact
that,
on
his
quitting
Derbyshire,
he
had
left
many
debts
behind
him,
which
Mr.
Darcy
afterwards
discharged.
As
for
Elizabeth,
her
thoughts
were
at
Pemberley
this
evening
more
than
the
last;
and
the
evening,
though
as
it
passed
it
seemed
long,
was
not
long
enough
to
determine
her
feelings
towards
one
in
that
mansion;
and
she
lay
awake
two
whole
hours
endeavouring
to
make
them

She
certainly
did
not
hate

No;
hatred
had
vanished
long

she
had
almost
as
long
been
ashamed
of
ever
feeling
a
dislike
against
him,
that
could
be
so
called.
The
respect
created
by
the
conviction
of
his
valuable
qualities,
though
at
first
unwillingly
admitted,
had
for
some
time
ceased
to
be
repugnant
to
her
feeling;
and
it
was
now
heightened
into
somewhat
of
a
friendlier
nature,
by
the
testimony
so
highly
in
his
favour,
and
bringing
forward
his
disposition
in
so
amiable
a
light,
which
yesterday
had
produced.
But
above
all,
above
respect
and
esteem,
there
