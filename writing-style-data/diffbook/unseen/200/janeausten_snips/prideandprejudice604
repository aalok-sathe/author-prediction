must
sometimes
think
the
pleasure
dearly
bought,
when
she
saw
Mr.
Darcy
exposed
to
all
the
parading
and
obsequious
civility
of
her
husband.
He
bore
it,
however,
with
admirable
calmness.
He
could
even
listen
to
Sir
William
Lucas,
when
he
complimented
him
on
carrying
away
the
brightest
jewel
of
the
country,
and
expressed
his
hopes
of
their
all
meeting
frequently
at
St.
James's,
with
very
decent
composure.
If
he
did
shrug
his
shoulders,
it
was
not
till
Sir
William
was
out
of
sight.
Mrs.
Phillips's
vulgarity
was
another,
and
perhaps
a
greater,
tax
on
his
forbearance;
and
though
Mrs.
Phillips,
as
well
as
her
sister,
stood
in
too
much
awe
of
him
to
speak
with
the
familiarity
which
Bingley's
good
humour
encouraged,
yet,
whenever
she
did
speak,
she
must
be
vulgar.
Nor
was
her
respect
for
him,
though
it
made
her
more
quiet,
at
all
likely
to
make
her
more
elegant.
Elizabeth
did
all
she
could
to
shield
him
from
the
frequent
notice
of
either,
and
was
ever
anxious
to
keep
him
to
herself,
and
to
those
of
her
family
with
whom
he
might
converse
without
mortification;
and
though
the
uncomfortable
feelings
arising
from
all
this
took
from
the
season
