you
be
sorry,
sir?
I
assure
you,
it
did
the
children
a
great
deal
of
good."
"And,
moreover,
if
you
must
go
to
the
sea,
it
had
better
not
have
been
to
South
End.
South
End
is
an
unhealthy
place.
Perry
was
surprized
to
hear
you
had
fixed
upon
South
End."
"I
know
there
is
such
an
idea
with
many
people,
but
indeed
it
is
quite
a
mistake,
sir.
We
all
had
our
health
perfectly
well
there,
never
found
the
least
inconvenience
from
the
mud;
and
Mr.
Wingfield
says
it
is
entirely
a
mistake
to
suppose
the
place
unhealthy;
and
I
am
sure
he
may
be
depended
on,
for
he
thoroughly
understands
the
nature
of
the
air,
and
his
own
brother
and
family
have
been
there
repeatedly."
"You
should
have
gone
to
Cromer,
my
dear,
if
you
went
anywhere.
Perry
was
a
week
at
Cromer
once,
and
he
holds
it
to
be
the
best
of
all
the
sea
bathing
places.
A
fine
open
sea,
he
says,
and
very
pure
air.
And,
by
what
I
understand,
you
might
have
had
lodgings
there
quite
away
from
the
sea
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
very
comfortable.
You
should
have
consulted
Perry."
"But,
