had
walked
in
then,
soon
after
tea,
and
dissipated
every
melancholy
fancy.
Alas!
such
delightful
proofs
of
Hartfield's
attraction,
as
those
sort
of
visits
conveyed,
might
shortly
be
over.
The
picture
which
she
had
then
drawn
of
the
privations
of
the
approaching
winter,
had
proved
erroneous;
no
friends
had
deserted
them,
no
pleasures
had
been
lost.
But
her
present
forebodings
she
feared
would
experience
no
similar
contradiction.
The
prospect
before
her
now,
was
threatening
to
a
degree
that
could
not
be
entirely
dispelled
that
might
not
be
even
partially
brightened.
If
all
took
place
that
might
take
place
among
the
circle
of
her
friends,
Hartfield
must
be
comparatively
deserted;
and
she
left
to
cheer
her
father
with
the
spirits
only
of
ruined
happiness.
The
child
to
be
born
at
Randalls
must
be
a
tie
there
even
dearer
than
herself;
and
Mrs.
Weston's
heart
and
time
would
be
occupied
by
it.
They
should
lose
her;
and,
probably,
in
great
measure,
her
husband
also.
Frank
Churchill
would
return
among
them
no
more;
and
Miss
Fairfax,
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose,
would
soon
cease
to
belong
to
Highbury.
They
would
be
married,
and
settled
either
at
or
near
Enscombe.
All
that
were
good
