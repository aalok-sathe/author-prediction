Fairfax
looking?"
"Ill,
very
ill
that
is,
if
a
young
lady
can
ever
be
allowed
to
look
ill.
But
the
expression
is
hardly
admissible,
Mrs.
Weston,
is
it?
Ladies
can
never
look
ill.
And,
seriously,
Miss
Fairfax
is
naturally
so
pale,
as
almost
always
to
give
the
appearance
of
ill
health.
A
most
deplorable
want
of
complexion."
Emma
would
not
agree
to
this,
and
began
a
warm
defence
of
Miss
Fairfax's
complexion.
"It
was
certainly
never
brilliant,
but
she
would
not
allow
it
to
have
a
sickly
hue
in
general;
and
there
was
a
softness
and
delicacy
in
her
skin
which
gave
peculiar
elegance
to
the
character
of
her
face."
He
listened
with
all
due
deference;
acknowledged
that
he
had
heard
many
people
say
the
same
but
yet
he
must
confess,
that
to
him
nothing
could
make
amends
for
the
want
of
the
fine
glow
of
health.
Where
features
were
indifferent,
a
fine
complexion
gave
beauty
to
them
all;
and
where
they
were
good,
the
effect
was
fortunately
he
need
not
attempt
to
describe
what
the
effect
was.
"Well,"
said
Emma,
"there
is
no
disputing
about
taste.
At
least
you
admire
her
except
her
complexion."
He
shook
his
head
and
