very
much

the
credit
of
the
writer.
It
was
short,
but
expressed
good
sense,
warm
attachment,
liberality,
propriety,
even
delicacy
of
feeling.
She
paused
over
it,
while
Harriet
stood
anxiously
watching
for
her
opinion,
with
a
"Well,
well,"
and
was
at
last
forced
to
add,
"Is
it
a
good
letter?
or
is
it
too
short?"
"Yes,
indeed,
a
very

A
better
written
letter,
