succeeded
without
difficulty,
upon
Mrs.
Elton's
beginning
to
talk
to
him.
A
very
little
quiet
reflection
was
enough
to
satisfy
Emma
as
to
the
nature
of
her
agitation
on
hearing
this
news
of
Frank
Churchill.
She
was
soon
convinced
that
it
was
not
for
herself
she
was
feeling
at
all
apprehensive
or
embarrassed;
it
was
for
him.
Her
own
attachment
had
really
subsided
into
a
mere
nothing;
it
was
not
worth
thinking
of;
but

for
herself
would
be
necessary.
She
did
not
mean
to
have
her
own
affections
entangled
again,
and
it
would
be
incumbent
on
her
to
avoid
any
encouragement
of
his.
She
wished
she
might
be
able
to
keep
him
from
an
absolute
declaration.
That
would
be
so
very
painful
a
conclusion
of
their
present
acquaintance!
and
yet,
she
could
not
help
rather
anticipating
something
decisive.
She
felt
as
