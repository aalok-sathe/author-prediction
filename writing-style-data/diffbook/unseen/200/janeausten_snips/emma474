in
a
wife."
Emma
could
not
but
rejoice
to
hear
that
she
had
a
fault.
"Well,"
said
she,
"and
you
soon
silenced
Mr.
Cole,
I
suppose?"
"Yes,
very
soon.
He
gave
me
a
quiet
hint;
I
told
him
he
was
mistaken;
he
asked
my
pardon
and
said
no
more.
Cole
does
not
want
to
be
wiser
or
wittier
than
his
neighbours."
"In
that
respect
how
unlike
dear
Mrs.
Elton,
who
wants
to
be
wiser
and
wittier
than
all
the
world!
I
wonder
how
she
speaks
of
the
Coles
what
she
calls
them!
How
can
she
find
any
appellation
for
them,
deep
enough
in
familiar
vulgarity?
She
calls
you,
Knightley
what
can
she
do
for
Mr.
Cole?
And
so
I
am
not
to
be
surprized
that
Jane
Fairfax
accepts
her
civilities
and
consents
to
be
with
her.
Mrs.
Weston,
your
argument
weighs
most
with
me.
I
can
much
more
readily
enter
into
the
temptation
of
getting
away
from
Miss
Bates,
than
I
can
believe
in
the
triumph
of
Miss
Fairfax's
mind
over
Mrs.
Elton.
I
have
no
faith
in
Mrs.
Elton's
acknowledging
herself
the
inferior
in
thought,
word,
or
deed;
or
in
her
being
under
any
restraint
beyond
her
own
scanty
