favourable.
Instead
of
answering,
Harriet
turned
away
confused,
and
stood
thoughtfully
by
the
fire;
and
though
the
letter
was
still
in
her
hand,
it
was
now
mechanically
twisted
about
without
regard.
Emma
waited
the
result
with
impatience,
but
not
without
strong
hopes.
At

said
"Miss
Woodhouse,
as
you
will
