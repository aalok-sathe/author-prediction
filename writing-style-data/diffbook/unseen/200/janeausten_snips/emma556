together,
it
will
not
give
me
another
moment's
pang:
and
to
convince
you
that
I
have
been
speaking
truth,
I
am
now
going
to
destroy
what
I
ought
to
have
destroyed
long
ago
what
I
ought
never
to
have
kept
I
know
that
very
well
(blushing
as
she
spoke).
However,
now
I
will
destroy
it
all
and
it
is
my
particular
wish
to
do
it
in
your
presence,
that
you
may
see
how
rational
I
am
grown.
Cannot
you
guess
what
this
parcel
holds?"
said
she,
with
a
conscious
look.
"Not
the
least
in
the
world.
Did
he
ever
give
you
any
thing?"
"No
I
cannot
call
them
gifts;
but
they
are
things
that
I
have
valued
very
much."
She
held
the
parcel
towards
her,
and
Emma
read
the
words
Most
precious
treasures
on
the
top.
Her
curiosity
was
greatly
excited.
Harriet
unfolded
the
parcel,
and
she
looked
on
with
impatience.
Within
abundance
of
silver
paper
was
a
pretty
little
Tunbridge
ware
box,
which
Harriet
opened:
it
was
well
lined
with
the
softest
cotton;
but,
excepting
the
cotton,
Emma
saw
only
a
small
piece
of
court
plaister.
"Now,"
said
Harriet,
"you
must
recollect."
"No,
indeed
I
do
not."
"Dear
me!
