Her
aunt
asked
her,
smilingly,
how
she
liked
it.
The
housekeeper
came
forward,
and
told
them
it
was
a
picture
of
a
young
gentleman,
the
son
of
her
late
master's
steward,
who
had
been
brought
up
by
him
at
his
own
expense.
"He
is
now
gone
into
the
army,"
she

or

Mrs.
Reynolds
respect
for
Elizabeth
seemed
to
increase
on
this
intimation
of
her
knowing
her
master.
"Does
that
young
lady
know
Mr.
Darcy?"
Elizabeth
coloured,
and
said:

think
