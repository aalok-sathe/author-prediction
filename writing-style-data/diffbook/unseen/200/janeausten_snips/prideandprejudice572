even
over
Wickham,
much
as
I
value
the
impudence
and
hypocrisy
of
my
son
in
law.
And
pray,
Lizzy,
what
said
Lady
Catherine
about
this
report?
Did
she
call
to
refuse
her
consent?"
To
this
question
his
daughter
replied
only
with
a
laugh;
and
as
it
had
been
asked
without
the
least
suspicion,
she
was
not
distressed
by
his
repeating
it.
Elizabeth
had
never
been
more
at
a
loss
to
make
her
feelings
appear
what
they
were

It
was
necessary
to
laugh,

of
excuse
from
his
friend,
as
Elizabeth
half
expected
Mr.
Bingley
to
do,
he
was
able
to
bring
Darcy
with
him
to
Longbourn
before
many
days
had
passed
after
Lady
Catherine's
visit.
The
gentlemen
arrived
early;
and,
before
Mrs.
Bennet
had
time
to
tell
him
of
their
having
seen
his
aunt,
of
which
her
daughter
sat
in
momentary
dread,
Bingley,
