Emma,
"but
you
must
not
be
expecting
such
a
very
fine
young
man;
you
have
only
had
my
account
you
know;
I
dare
say
he
is
really
nothing
extraordinary:"
though
his
own
sparkling
eyes
at
the
moment
were
speaking
a
very
different
conviction.
Emma
could
look
perfectly
unconscious
and
innocent,
and
answer
in
a
manner
that
appropriated
nothing.
"Think
of
me
to
morrow,
my
dear
Emma,
about
four
o'clock,"
was
Mrs.
Weston's
parting
injunction;
spoken
with
some
anxiety,
and
meant
only
for
her.
"Four
o'clock!
depend
upon
it
he
will
be
here
by
three,"
was
Mr.
Weston's
quick
amendment;
and
so
ended
a
most
satisfactory
meeting.
Emma's
spirits
were
mounted
quite
up
to
happiness;
every
thing
wore
a
different
air;
James
and
his
horses
seemed
not
half
so
sluggish
as
before.
When
she
looked
at
the
hedges,
she
thought
the
elder
at
least
must
soon
be
coming
out;
and
when
she
turned
round
to
Harriet,
she
saw
something
like
a
look
of
spring,
a
tender
smile
even
there.
"Will
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
pass
through
Bath
as
well
as
Oxford?"
was
a
question,
however,
which
did
not
augur
much.
But
neither
geography
nor
tranquillity
could
come
all
at
once,
and
Emma
