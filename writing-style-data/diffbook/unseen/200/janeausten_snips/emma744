to
Miss
Fairfax,
and
will
soon,
it
may
be
hoped,
have
the
advantage
of
being
constantly
with
her,
I
am
very
ready
to
believe
his
character
will
improve,
and
acquire
from
hers
the
steadiness
and
delicacy
of
principle
that
it
wants.
And
now,
let
me
talk
to
you
of
something
else.
I
have
another
person's
interest
at
present
so
much
at
heart,
that
I
cannot
think
any
longer
about
Frank
Churchill.
Ever
since
I
left
you
this
morning,
Emma,
my
mind
has
been
hard
at
work
on
one
subject."
The
subject

English,
such

woman

was
in

be
able
to
ask
her
to
marry
him,
without
attacking
the
happiness
of
her
father.
Emma's
answer
was
ready
at
the
first
word.
"While
her
dear
father
lived,
any
change
of
condition
must
be
impossible
for
her.
She
could
never
quit
him."
Part
only
of
this
answer,
however,
was
admitted.
The
impossibility
of
her
quitting
her
father,
Mr.
Knightley
felt
as
strongly
as
herself;
but
the
inadmissibility
of
any
other
change,
he
could
not
agree
to.
He
had
been
thinking
it
over
most
deeply,
most
