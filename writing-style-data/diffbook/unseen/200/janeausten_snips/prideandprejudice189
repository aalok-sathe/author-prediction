his
returning
no
more
Elizabeth
treated
with
the
utmost
contempt.
It
appeared
to
her
merely
the
suggestion
of
Caroline's
interested
wishes,
and
she
could
not
for
a
moment
suppose
that
those
wishes,
however
openly
or
artfully
spoken,
could
influence
a
young
man
so
totally
independent
of
everyone.
She
represented
to
her
sister
as
forcibly
as
possible
what
she
felt
on
the
subject,
and
had
soon
the
pleasure
of
seeing
its
happy
effect.
Jane's
temper
was
not
desponding,
and
she
was
gradually
led
to
hope,
though
the
diffidence
of
affection
sometimes
overcame
the
hope,

wish
of
her
heart.
They

that
Mrs.

of
the
family,
without
being
alarmed
on
the
score
of
the
gentleman's
conduct;
but
even
this
partial
communication
gave
her
a
great
deal
of
concern,
and
she
bewailed
it
as
exceedingly
unlucky
that
the
ladies
should
happen
to
go
away
just
as
they
were
all
getting
so
intimate
together.
After
lamenting
it,
however,
at
some
length,
she
had
the
consolation
that
Mr.
Bingley
would
be
soon
down
again
and
soon
dining
at
Longbourn,
and
the
conclusion
of
all
was
the
comfortable
declaration,
that
