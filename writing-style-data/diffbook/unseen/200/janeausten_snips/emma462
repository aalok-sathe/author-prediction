taking
it
for
granted
that
the
bride
must
be
as
clever
and
as
agreeable
as
she
professed
herself,
were
very
well
satisfied;
so
that
Mrs.
Elton's
praise
passed
from
one
mouth
to
another
as
it
ought
to
do,
unimpeded
by
Miss
Woodhouse,
who
readily
continued
her
first
contribution
and
talked
with
a
good
grace
of
her
being
"very
pleasant
and
very
elegantly
dressed."
In
one
respect
Mrs.
Elton
grew
even
worse
than
she
had
appeared
at
first.
Her
feelings
altered
towards
Emma.
Offended,
probably,
by
the
little
encouragement
which
her
proposals
of
intimacy
met
with,
she
drew
back
in
her
turn
and
gradually
became
much
more
cold
and
distant;
and
though
the
effect
was
agreeable,
the
ill
will
which
produced
it
was
necessarily
increasing
Emma's
dislike.
Her
manners,
too
and
Mr.
Elton's,
were
unpleasant
towards
Harriet.
They
were
sneering
and
negligent.
Emma
hoped
it
must
rapidly
work
Harriet's
cure;
but
the
sensations
which
could
prompt
such
behaviour
sunk
them
both
very
much.
It
was
not
to
be
doubted
that
poor
Harriet's
attachment
had
been
an
offering
to
conjugal
unreserve,
and
her
own
share
in
the
story,
under
a
colouring
the
least
favourable
to
her
and
the
most
soothing
to
him,
