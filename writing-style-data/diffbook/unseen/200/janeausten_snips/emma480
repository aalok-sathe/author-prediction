hours
without
falling
in
with
a
dinner
party.
She
comforted
her
father
better
than
she
could
comfort
herself,
by
representing
that
though
he
certainly
would
make
them
nine,
yet
he
always
said
so
little,
that
the
increase
of
noise
would
be
very
immaterial.
She
thought
it
in
reality
a
sad
exchange
for
herself,
to
have
him
with
his

and
the
philosophic
composure
of
her
brother
on
hearing
his
fate,
removed
the
chief
of
even
Emma's
vexation.
The
day
came,
the
party
were
punctually
assembled,
and
Mr.
John
Knightley
seemed
early
to
devote
himself
to
the
business
of
being
agreeable.
Instead
of
drawing
his
brother
