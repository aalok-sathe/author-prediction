to
me
to
find
occasions
for
teasing
and
quarrelling
with
you
as
often
as
may
be;
and
I
shall
begin
directly
by
asking
you
what
made
you
so
unwilling
to
come
to
the
point
at
last.
What
made
you
so
shy
of
me,
when
you
first
called,
and
afterwards
dined
here?
Why,
especially,
when
you
called,
did
you
look
as
if
you
did
not
care
about
me?"
"Because
you
were
grave
and
silent,
and
gave
me
no
encouragement."
"But
I
was
embarrassed."
"And
so
was
I."
"You
might
have
talked
to
me
more
when
you
came
to
dinner."
"A
man
who
had
felt
less,
might."
"How
unlucky
that
you
should
have
a
reasonable
answer
to
give,
and
that
I
should
be
so
reasonable
as
to
admit
it!
But
I
wonder
how
long
you
would
have
gone
on,
if
you
had
been
left
to
yourself.
I
wonder
when
you
would
have
spoken,
if
I
had
not
asked
you!
My
resolution
of
thanking
you
for
your
kindness
to
Lydia
had
certainly
great
effect.
Too
much,
I
am
afraid;
for
what
becomes
of
the
moral,
if
our
comfort
springs
from
a
breach
of
promise?
for
I
ought
not
to
have
mentioned
the
subject.
