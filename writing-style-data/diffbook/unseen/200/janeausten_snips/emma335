which
she
had
believed
herself
to
discern
in
him
yesterday.
Vanity,
extravagance,
love
of
change,
restlessness
of
temper,
which
must
be
doing
something,
good
or
bad;
heedlessness
as
to
the
pleasure
of
his
father
and
Mrs.
Weston,
indifferent
as
to
how
his
conduct
might
appear
in
general;
he
became
liable
to
all
these
charges.
His
father
only
called
him
a
coxcomb,
and
thought
it
a
very
good
story;
but
that
Mrs.
Weston
did
not
like
it,
was
clear
enough,
by
her
passing
it
over
as
quickly
as
possible,
and
making
no
other
comment
than
that
"all
young
people
would
have
their
little
whims."
With
the
exception
of
this
little
blot,
Emma
found
that
his
visit
hitherto
had
given
her
friend
only
good
ideas
of
him.
Mrs.
Weston
was
very
ready
to
say
how
attentive
and
pleasant
a
companion
he
made
himself
how
much
she
saw
to
like
in
his
disposition
altogether.
He
appeared
to
have
a
very
open
temper
certainly
a
very
cheerful
and
lively
one;
she
could
observe
nothing
wrong
in
his
notions,
a
great
deal
decidedly
right;
he
spoke
of
his
uncle
with
warm
regard,
was
fond
of
talking
of
him
said
he
would
be
the
best
man
