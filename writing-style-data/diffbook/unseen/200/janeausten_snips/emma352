their
silence
as
any
reason
for
their
not
meaning
to
make
the
present.
They
might
chuse
to
surprize
her."
Mrs.
Cole
had
many
to
agree
with
her;
every
body
who
spoke
on
the
subject
was
equally
convinced
that
it
must
come
from
Colonel
Campbell,
and
equally
rejoiced
that
such

been
made;
and

Mr.
Cole,
I
really

ashamed
to
look
at
our
new
grand
pianoforte
in
the
drawing
room,
while
I
do
not
know

little
girls,
who
are

perhaps
may
