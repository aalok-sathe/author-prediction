but
she
would
be
ready
to
quarrel
with
you
for
using
such
words.
Don't
let
her
imagine
that
you
have
spoken
of
her
as
a
pretty
young
woman."
"I
hope
I
should
know
better,"
he
replied;
"no,
depend
upon
it,
(with
a
gallant
bow,)
that
in
addressing
Mrs.
Weston
I
should
understand
whom
I
might
praise
without
any
danger

being

Emma
wondered
whether
the
same
suspicion
of
what
might
be
expected
from
their
knowing

She
had
no
doubt
of
what
Mr.
Weston
was
often
thinking
about.
His
quick
eye
she
detected
again
and
again
glancing
towards
them
with
a
happy
expression;
and
even,
when
he
might
have
determined
not
to
look,
she
was
confident
that
he
was
often
listening.
Her
own
father's
perfect
exemption
from
any
thought
of
the
kind,
the
entire
deficiency
