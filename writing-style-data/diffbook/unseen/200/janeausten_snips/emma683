had
it,
by
any
blessed
felicity,
occurred
to
her,
to
institute
the
comparison.
She
saw
that
there
never
had
been
a
time
when
she
did
not
consider
Mr.
Knightley
as
infinitely
the
superior,
or
when
his
regard
for
her
had
not
been
infinitely
the
most
dear.
She
saw,
that
in
persuading
herself,
in
fancying,
in
acting
to
the
contrary,
she
had
been
entirely
under
a
delusion,
totally
ignorant
of
her
own
heart
and,
in
short,
that
she
had
never
really
cared
for
Frank
Churchill
at
all!
This
was
the
conclusion
of
the
first
series
of
reflection.
This
was
the
knowledge
of
herself,
on
the
first
question
of
inquiry,
which
she
reached;
and
without
being
long
in
reaching
it.
She
was
most
sorrowfully
indignant;
ashamed
of
every
sensation
but
the
one
revealed
to
her
her
affection
for
Mr.
Knightley.
Every
other
part
of
her
mind
was
disgusting.
With
insufferable
vanity
had
she
believed
herself
in
the
secret
of
every
body's
feelings;
with
unpardonable
arrogance
proposed
to
arrange
every
body's
destiny.
She
was
proved
to
have
been
universally
mistaken;
and
she
had
not
quite
done
nothing
for
she
had
done
mischief.
She
had
brought
evil
on
Harriet,
on
herself,
and
she
too
