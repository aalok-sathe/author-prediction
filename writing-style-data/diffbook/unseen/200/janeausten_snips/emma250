she
went
through
it
very
well,
with
all
the
interest
and
all
the
commendation
that
could
be
requisite,
and
always
putting
forward
to
prevent
Harriet's
being
obliged
to
say
a
word.
This
she
had
been
prepared
for
when
she
entered
the
house;
but
meant,
having
once
talked
him
handsomely
over,
to
be
no
farther
incommoded
by
any
troublesome
topic,
and
to
wander
at
large
amongst
all
the
Mistresses
and
Misses
of
Highbury,
and
their
card
parties.
She
had
not
been
prepared
to
have
Jane
Fairfax
succeed
Mr.
Elton;
but
he
was
actually
hurried
off
by
Miss
Bates,
she
jumped
away
from
him
at
last
abruptly
to
the
Coles,
to
usher
in
a
letter
from
her
niece.
"Oh!
yes
Mr.
Elton,
I
understand
certainly
as
to
dancing
Mrs.
Cole
was
telling
me
that
dancing
at
the
rooms
at
Bath
was
Mrs.
Cole
was
so
kind
as
to
sit
some
time
with
us,
talking
of
Jane;
for
as
soon
as
she
came
in,
she
began
inquiring
after
her,
Jane
is
so
very
great
a
favourite
there.
Whenever
she
is
with
us,
Mrs.
Cole
does
not
know
how
to
shew
her
kindness
enough;
and
I
must
say
that
Jane
deserves
it
as
much
