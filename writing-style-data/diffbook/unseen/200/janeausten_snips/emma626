very
trying
for
us
to
part
with
her,
after
having
had
her
so
long,
and
she
has
a
dreadful
headache
just
now,
writing
all
the
morning:
such
long
letters,
you
know,
to
be
written
to
Colonel
Campbell,
and
Mrs.
Dixon.
'My
dear,'
said
I,
'you
will
blind
yourself'
for
tears
were
in
her
eyes
perpetually.
One
cannot
wonder,
one
cannot
wonder.
It
is
a
great
change;
and
though
she
is
amazingly
fortunate
such
a
situation,
I
suppose,
as
no
young
woman
before
ever
met
with
on
first
going
out
do
not
think
us
ungrateful,
Miss
Woodhouse,
for
such
surprising
good
fortune
(again
dispersing
her
tears)
but,
poor
dear
soul!
if
you
were
to
see
what
a
headache
she
has.
When
one
is
in
great
pain,
you
know
one
cannot
feel
any
blessing
quite
as
it
may
deserve.
She
is
as
low
as
possible.
To
look
at
her,
nobody
would
think
how
delighted
and
happy
she
is
to
have
secured
such
a
situation.
You
will
excuse
her
not
coming
to
you
she
is
not
able
she
is
gone
into
her
own
room
I
want
her
to
lie
down
upon
the
bed.
'My
dear,'
said
I,
'I
shall
say
you
are
laid
