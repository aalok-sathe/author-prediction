proved
her
to
be
more
truly
well
bred
than
either
of
the
others;
and
between
her
and
Mrs.
Gardiner,
with
occasional
help
from
Elizabeth,
the
conversation
was
carried
on.
Miss
Darcy
looked
as
if
she
wished
for
courage
enough
to
join
in
it;
and
sometimes
did
venture
a
short
sentence
when
there
was
least
danger
of
its
being
heard.
Elizabeth
soon
saw
that
she
was
herself
closely
watched
by
Miss
Bingley,
and
that
she
could
not
speak
a

thoughts
were
employing
her.
She
expected
every

the
gentlemen
would
enter
the
room.
She
wished,
she
feared
that
the
master
of
the
house
might
be
amongst
them;
and
whether
she
wished
or
feared
it
most,
she
could
scarcely
determine.
After
sitting
in
this
manner
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
hearing
Miss
Bingley's
voice,
Elizabeth
was
roused
by
receiving
from
her
a
cold
inquiry
after
the
health
of
her
family.
She
