friend,
Miss
Smith,
and
my
son
and
then
I
should
say
we
were
quite
complete.
I
believe
you
did
not
hear
me
telling
the
others
in
the
drawing
room
that
we
are
expecting
Frank.
I
had
a
letter
from
him
this
morning,
and
he

be
with
us

a

Emma

of
seeing
him
here
about
the
second
week
in
January."
"What
a
very
great
pleasure
it
will
be
to
you!
and
Mrs.
Weston
is
so
anxious
to
be
acquainted
with
him,
that
she
must
be
almost
as
happy
as
yourself."
"Yes,
she
would
be,
but

she
thinks
there
