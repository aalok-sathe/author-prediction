than
she
was
equal
to,
and
that
she
felt
it
so
herself,
though
she
would
not
own
it.
Her
spirits
seemed
overcome.
Her
present
home,
he
could
not
but
observe,
was
unfavourable
to
a
nervous
disorder:
confined
always
to
one
room;
he
could
have
wished
it
otherwise
and
her
good
aunt,
though
his
very
old
friend,
he
must
acknowledge
to

and
quiet
rational
conversation,
even
for
an
hour
or
two,
might
do
her
good;
and
the
following
morning
she
wrote
again
to
say,
in
the
most
feeling
language
she
could
command,
that
she
would
call
for
her
in
the
carriage
at
any
hour

Jane
would
name
