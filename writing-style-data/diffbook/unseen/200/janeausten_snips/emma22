but
it
was
not
in
Mr.
Weston's
nature
to
imagine
that
any
caprice
could
be
strong
enough
to
affect
one
so
dear,
and,
as
he
believed,
so
deservedly
dear.
He
saw
his
son
every
year
in
London,
and
was
proud
of
him;
and
his
fond
report
of
him
as
a
very
fine
young
man
had
made
Highbury
feel
a
sort
of
pride
in
him
too.
He
was
looked
on
as
sufficiently
belonging
to
the
place
to
make
his
merits
and
prospects
a
kind
of
common
concern.
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
was
one
of
the
boasts
of
Highbury,
and
a
lively
curiosity
to
see
him
prevailed,
though
the
compliment
was
so
little
returned
that
he
had
never
been
there
in
his
life.
His
coming
to
visit
his
father
had
been
often
talked
of
but
never
achieved.
Now,
upon
his
father's
marriage,
it
was
very
generally
proposed,
as
a
most
proper
attention,
that
the
visit
should
take
place.
There
was
not
a
dissentient
voice
on
the
subject,
either
when
Mrs.
Perry
drank
tea
with
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates,
or
when
Mrs.
and
Miss
Bates
returned
the
visit.
Now
was
the
time
for
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
to
come
among
them;
and
the
hope
strengthened
