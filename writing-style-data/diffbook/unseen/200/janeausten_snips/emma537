bestowed
till
after
a
ball
has
ceased
to
be,
was
repeatedly
given
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
existence
of
this.
Of
very
important,
very
recordable
events,
it
was
not
more
productive
than
such
meetings
usually
are.
There
was
one,
however,
which
Emma
thought
something
of.
The
two
last
dances
before
supper
were
begun,
and
Harriet
had
no
partner;
the
only
young
lady
sitting
down;
and
so
equal
had
been
hitherto
the
number
of
dancers,
that
how
there
could
be
any
one
disengaged
was
the
wonder!
But
Emma's
wonder
lessened
soon
afterwards,
on
seeing
Mr.
Elton
sauntering
about.
He
would
not
ask
Harriet
to
dance
if
it
were
possible
to
be
avoided:
she
was
sure
he
would
not
and
she
was
expecting
him
every
moment
to
escape
into
the
card
room.
Escape,
however,
was
not
his
plan.
He
came
to
the
part
of
the
room
where
the
sitters
by
were
collected,
spoke
to
some,
and
walked
about
in
front
of
them,
as
if
to
shew
his
liberty,
and
his
resolution
of
maintaining
it.
He
did
not
omit
being
sometimes
directly
before
Miss
Smith,
or
speaking
to
those
who
were
close
to
her.
Emma
saw
it.
She
was
not
yet
dancing;
