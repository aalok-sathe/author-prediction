forward
to
exactly
such
a
close
of
the
present
day,
a
note
was
brought
from
Mrs.
Goddard,
requesting,
in
most
respectful
terms,
to
be
allowed
to
bring
Miss
Smith
with
her;
a
most
welcome
request:
for
Miss
Smith
was
a
girl
of
seventeen,
whom
Emma
knew
very
well
by
sight,
and
had
long
felt
an
interest
in,
on
account
of
her
beauty.
A
very
gracious
invitation
was
returned,
and
the
evening
no
longer
dreaded
by
the
fair
mistress
of
the
mansion.
Harriet
Smith
was
the
natural
daughter
of
somebody.
Somebody
had
placed
her,
several
years
back,
at
Mrs.
Goddard's
school,
and
somebody
had
lately
raised
her
from
the
condition
of
scholar
to
that
of
parlour
boarder.
This
was
all
that
was
generally
known
of
her
history.
She
had
no
visible
friends
but
what
had
been
acquired
at
Highbury,
and
was
now
just
returned
from
a
long
visit
in
the
country
to
some
young
ladies
who
had
been
at
school
there
with
her.
She
was
a
very
pretty
girl,
and
her
beauty
happened
to
be
of
a
sort
which
Emma
particularly
admired.
She
was
short,
plump,
and
fair,
with
a
fine
bloom,
blue
eyes,
light
hair,
regular
features,
and
a
look
