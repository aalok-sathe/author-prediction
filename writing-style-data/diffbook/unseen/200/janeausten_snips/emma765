to
wait
for."
"Thank
you,
thank
you.
This
is
just
what
I
wanted
to
be
assured
of.
Oh!
if
you
knew
how
much
I
love
every
thing
that
is
decided
and
open!
Good
bye,
good
bye."
Mrs.
Weston's
friends
were
all
made
happy
by
her
safety;
and
if
the
satisfaction
of
her
well
doing
could
be
increased
to
Emma,
it
was
by
knowing
her
to
be
the
mother
of
a
little
girl.
She
had
been
decided
in
wishing
for
a
Miss
Weston.
She
would
not
acknowledge
that
it

a

to
Mr.
Weston,
as

grew
older
and
even
Mr.
Weston
might
be
growing
older
ten
years
hence
to
have
his
fireside
enlivened
by
the
sports
and
the
nonsense,
the
freaks
and
the
fancies
of
a
child
never
banished
from
home;
and
Mrs.
Weston
no
one
could
doubt
that
a
daughter
would
be
most
to
her;
and
it
would
be
quite
a
pity
that
any
one
who
so
well
knew
how
to
teach,
should
not
have
