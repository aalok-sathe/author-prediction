adapted
her
for
attending
to
them
in
every
way
teaching
them,
playing
with
them,
and
loving
them.
The
Gardiners
stayed
only
one
night
at
Longbourn,
and
set
off
the
next
morning
with
Elizabeth
in
pursuit
of
novelty
and
amusement.
One
enjoyment
was
certain
that
of
suitableness
of
companions;
a
suitableness
which
comprehended
health
and
temper
to
bear
inconveniences
cheerfulness
to
enhance
every
pleasure
and
affection
and
intelligence,
which
might
supply

among
themselves
if
there
were
disappointments
abroad.
It
is
not
the
object
of
this
work
to
give
a
description
of
Derbyshire,

of

of
the
remarkable

through
which
their
route
thither

Blenheim,
Warwick,
Kenilworth,
Birmingham,
etc.

sufficiently

of
Derbyshire
is

the
present

To
the

Lambton,
the
scene
of
Mrs.
Gardiner's
former
residence,
and
where
she
had
lately
learned
some
acquaintance
still
remained,
they
bent
their
steps,
after
having
seen
all
the
principal
wonders
of
the
country;
and
within
five
miles
of
Lambton,
Elizabeth
found
from
her
aunt
that
Pemberley
was
situated.
It
was
not
in
their
direct
road,
nor
more
than
a
mile
or
two
out
of
it.
