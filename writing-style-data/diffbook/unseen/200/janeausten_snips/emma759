make,
if
we
could
be
shaken
together.
My
liveliness
and
your
solidity
would
produce
perfection.
Not
that
I
presume
to
insinuate,
however,
that
some
people
may
not
think
you
perfection
already.
But
hush!
not
a
word,
if
you
please."
It
seemed
an
unnecessary
caution;
Jane
was
wanting
to
give
her
words,
not
to
Mrs.
Elton,
but
to
Miss
Woodhouse,
as
the
latter
plainly
saw.
The
wish
of
distinguishing
her,
as
far
as
civility
permitted,
was
very
evident,
though

friends,
so
long
before
you
vouchsafe
to
come!
But
you
knew
what
a
dutiful
creature
you
had
to
deal
with.
You
knew
I
should
not
stir
till
my
lord
and
master
appeared.
Here
have
I
been
sitting
this
hour,
giving
these
young
ladies
a
sample
of
true
conjugal
obedience
for
who
can
say,
you
know,
how
soon
it
may
be
wanted?"
Mr.
Elton
was
so
hot
and
tired,
that
all
this
wit
seemed
thrown
away.
His
civilities
to
the
other
ladies
