But
my
feelings
are
not
only
cordial
towards
him;
they
are
even
impartial
towards
Miss
King.
I
cannot
find
out
that
I
hate
her
at
all,
or
that
I
am
in
the
least
unwilling
to
think
her
a
very

young
men
must
have
something
to
live
on
as

as
the
plain."
With
no
greater
events
than
these
in
the
Longbourn
family,
and
otherwise
diversified
by
little

the
walks
to
Meryton,
sometimes
dirty
and
sometimes
cold,
did
January
and
February
pass
away.
March
was
to
take
Elizabeth
to
Hunsford.
She
had
