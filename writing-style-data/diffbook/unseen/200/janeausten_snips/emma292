Woodhouse,
do
talk
to
me
and
make
me
comfortable
again."
Very
sincerely
did
Emma
wish
to
do
so;
but
it
was
not
immediately
in
her
power.
She
was
obliged
to
stop
and
think.
She
was
not
thoroughly
comfortable
herself.
The
young
man's
conduct,
and
his
sister's,
seemed
the
result
of
real
feeling,
and
she
could
not

Of

rise
by
Harriet's
acquaintance:
and
besides,
what
was
the
value
of
Harriet's
description?
So
easily
pleased
so
little
discerning;
what
signified
her
praise?
She
exerted
herself,
and
did
try
to
make
her
comfortable,
by
considering
all
that
had
passed
as
a
mere
trifle,
and
quite
unworthy
of
being
dwelt
