grateful
blessings
that
she
could
utter
for
her
friend
and
herself.
Such
an
adventure
as
this,
a
fine
young
man
and
a
lovely
young
woman
thrown
together
in
such
a
way,
could
hardly
fail
of
suggesting
certain
ideas
to
the
coldest
heart
and
the
steadiest
brain.
So
Emma
thought,
at
least.
Could
a
linguist,
could
a
grammarian,
could
even
a
mathematician
have
seen
what
she
did,

witnessed
their
appearance
together,

sort
had
ever
occurred
before
to
any
young
ladies
in
the
place,
within
her
memory;
no
rencontre,
no
alarm
of
the
kind;
and
now
it
had
happened
to
the
very
person,
and
at
the
very
hour,
when
the
other
very
person
was
chancing
to
pass
by
to
rescue
her!
It
certainly
was
very
extraordinary!
And
knowing,
as
she
did,
the
favourable
state
of
mind
of
each
at
this
period,
