clothes!
I
will
write
to
my
sister
Gardiner
about
them
directly.
Lizzy,
my
dear,
run
down
to
your
father,
and
ask
him
how
much
he
will
give
her.
Stay,
stay,
I
will
go
myself.
Ring
the
bell,
Kitty,
for
Hill.
I
will
put
on
my
things
in
a
moment.
My
dear,
dear
Lydia!
How
merry
we
shall
be
together
when
we
meet!"
Her
eldest
daughter
endeavoured
to
give
some
relief
to
the
violence
of
these

do
it
but
her
own
uncle?
If
he
had
not
had
a
family
of
his
own,
I
and
my
children
must
have
had
all
his
money,
you
know;
and
it
is
the
first
time
we
have
ever
had
anything
from
him,
except
a
few
presents.
Well!
I
am
so
happy!
In
a
short
time
I
shall
have
a
daughter
married.
Mrs.
Wickham!
How
well
it
sounds!
