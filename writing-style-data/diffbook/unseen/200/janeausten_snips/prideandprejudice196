her
younger
girls,
and
Mary
might
have
been
prevailed
on
to
accept
him.
She
rated
his
abilities
much
higher
than
any
of
the
others;
there
was
a
solidity
in
his
reflections
which
often
struck
her,
and
though
by
no
means
so
clever
as
herself,
she
thought
that
if
encouraged
to
read
and
improve
himself
by
such
an
example
as
hers,
he
might
become
a
very
agreeable
companion.
But
on
the
following
morning,
every
hope
of
this
kind
was
done
away.
Miss
Lucas
called
soon
after
breakfast,
and
in
a
private
conference
with
Elizabeth
related
the
event
of
the
day
before.
The
possibility
of
Mr.
Collins's
fancying
himself
in
love
with
her
friend
had
once
occurred
to
Elizabeth
within
the
last
day
or
two;
but
that
Charlotte
could
encourage
him
seemed
almost
as
far
from
possibility
as
she
could
encourage
him
herself,
and
her
astonishment
was
consequently
so
great
as
to
overcome
at
first
the
bounds
of
decorum,
and
she
could
not
help
crying
out:
"Engaged
to
Mr.
Collins!
My
dear
Charlotte
impossible!"
The
steady
countenance
which
Miss
Lucas
had
commanded
in
telling
her
story,
gave
way
to
a
momentary
confusion
here
on
receiving
so
direct
a
reproach;
though,
as
it
