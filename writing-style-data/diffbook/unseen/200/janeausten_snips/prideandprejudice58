was
going
forward.
As
all
conversation
was
thereby
at
an
end,
Elizabeth
soon
afterwards
left
the
room.
"Elizabeth
Bennet,"
said
Miss
Bingley,
when
the
door
was
closed
on
her,
"is
one
of
those
young
ladies
who
seek
to
recommend
themselves
to
the
other
sex
by
undervaluing
their
own;
and
with
many
men,
I
dare
say,
it
succeeds.
But,
in
my
opinion,
it
is
a
paltry
device,
a
very
mean
art."
"Undoubtedly,"
replied
Darcy,
to
whom
this
remark
was
chiefly
addressed,
"there
is
a
meanness
in
all
the
arts
which
ladies
sometimes
condescend
to
employ
for
captivation.
Whatever
bears
affinity
to
cunning
is
despicable."
Miss
Bingley
was
not
so
entirely
satisfied
with
this
reply
as
to
continue
the
subject.
Elizabeth
joined
them
again
only
to
say
that
her
sister
was
worse,
and
that
she
could
not
leave
her.
Bingley
urged
Mr.
Jones
being
sent
for
immediately;
while
his
sisters,
convinced
that
no
country
advice
could
be
of
any
service,
recommended
an
express
to
town
for
one
of
the
most
eminent
physicians.
This
she
would
not
hear
of;
but
she
was
not
so
unwilling
to
comply
with
their
brother's
proposal;
and
it
was
settled
that
Mr.
Jones
should
be
sent
for
early
