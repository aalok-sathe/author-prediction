before
she
went
on.
"Having
understood
as
much,
I
was
rather
astonished
to
find
her
so
very
lady
like!
But
she
is
really
quite
the
gentlewoman."
"Mrs.
Weston's
manners,"
said
Emma,
"were
always
particularly
good.
Their
propriety,
simplicity,
and
elegance,
would
make
them
the
safest
model
for
any
young
woman."
"And
who
do
you
think
came
in
while
we
were
there?"
Emma
was
quite
at
a
loss.
The
tone
implied
some
old
acquaintance
and
how
could
she
possibly
guess?
"Knightley!"

him;
and
I
must
do

the
justice
to
say
that
he
need
not
be
ashamed
of
his
friend.
Knightley
is
quite
the
gentleman.
I
like
him
very
much.
Decidedly,
I
think,
a
very
gentleman
like

Happily,
it
was
now
time
to
