had
been
in
a
very
suffering
state
(so
said
her
husband)
when
writing
to
her
nephew
two
days
before,
though
from
her
usual
unwillingness
to
give
pain,
and
constant
habit
of
never
thinking
of
herself,
she
had
not
mentioned
it;
but
now
she
was
too
ill
to
trifle,
and
must
entreat
him
to
set
off
for
Enscombe
without
delay.
The
substance
of
this
letter
was
forwarded
to
Emma,
in
a
note
from
Mrs.
Weston,
instantly.
As
to
his
going,
it
was
inevitable.
He
must
be
gone
within
a
few
hours,
though
without
feeling
any
real
alarm
for
his
aunt,
to
lessen
his
repugnance.
He
knew
her
illnesses;
they
never
occurred
but
for
her
own
convenience.
Mrs.
Weston
added,
"that
he
could
only
allow
himself
time
to
hurry
to
Highbury,
after
breakfast,
and
take
leave
of
the
few
friends
there
whom
he
could
suppose
to
feel
any
interest
in
him;
and
that
he
might
be
expected
at
Hartfield
very
soon."
This
wretched
note
was
the
finale
of
Emma's
breakfast.
When
once
it
had
been
read,
there
was
no
doing
any
thing,
but
lament
and
exclaim.
The
loss
of
the
ball
the
loss
of
the
young
man
and
all
that
the
young
