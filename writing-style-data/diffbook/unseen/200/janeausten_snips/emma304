understand
the
sort
of
meeting,
and
the
sort
of
pain
it
was
creating.
She
had
seen
only
Mrs.
Martin
and
the
two
girls.
They
had
received
her
doubtingly,
if
not
coolly;
and
nothing
beyond
the
merest
commonplace
had
been
talked
almost
all
the
time
till
just
at
last,
when
Mrs.
Martin's
saying,
all
of
a
sudden,
that
she
thought
Miss
Smith
was
grown,
had
brought
on
a
more
interesting
subject,
and
a
warmer
manner.
In
that
very
room
she
had
been
measured
last
September,
with
her
two
friends.
There
were
the
pencilled
marks
and
memorandums
on
the
wainscot
by
the
window.
He
had
done
it.
They
all
seemed
to
remember
the
day,
the
hour,
the
party,
the
occasion
to
feel
the
same
consciousness,
the
same
regrets
to
be
ready
to
return
to
the
same
good
understanding;
and
they
were
just
growing
again
like
themselves,
(Harriet,
as
Emma
must
suspect,
as
ready
as
the
best
of
them
to
be
cordial
and
happy,)
when
the
carriage
reappeared,
and
all
was
over.
The
style
of
the
visit,
and
the
shortness
of
it,
were
then
felt
to
be
decisive.
Fourteen
minutes
to
be
given
to
those
with
whom
she
had
thankfully
passed
six
weeks
