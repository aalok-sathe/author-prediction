with
the
liveliest
pleasure,
and
Elizabeth
was
more
and
more
satisfied
with
coming
when
she
found
herself
so
affectionately
received.
She
saw
instantly
that
her
cousin's
manners
were
not
altered
by
his
marriage;
his
formal
civility
was
just
what
it
had
been,
and
he
detained
her

They

its
furniture,
he
addressed
himself
particularly

wishing
to
make
her
feel
what
she
had
lost
in
refusing
him.
But
though
everything
seemed
neat
and
comfortable,
she
was
not
able
to
gratify
him
by
any
sigh
of
repentance,
and
rather
looked
with
wonder
