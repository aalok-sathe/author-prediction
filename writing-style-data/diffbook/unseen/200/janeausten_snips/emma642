what
would
Mr.
Churchill
do
without
her?
Mr.
Churchill's
loss
would
be
dreadful
indeed.
Mr.
Churchill
would
never
get
over
it."
Even
Mr.
Weston
shook
his
head,
and
looked
solemn,
and
said,
"Ah!
poor
woman,
who
would
have
thought
it!"
and
resolved,
that
his
mourning
should
be
as
handsome
as
possible;
and
his
wife
sat
sighing
and
moralising
over
her
broad
hems
with
a
commiseration
and
good
sense,
true
and
steady.
How
it
would
affect
Frank
was
among
the
earliest
thoughts
of
both.
It
was
also
a
very
early
speculation
with
Emma.
The
character
of
Mrs.
Churchill,
the
grief
of
her
husband
her
mind
glanced
over
them
both
with
awe
and
compassion
and
then
rested
with
lightened
feelings
on
how
Frank
might
be
affected
by
the
event,
how
benefited,
how
freed.
She
saw
in
a
moment
all
the
possible
good.
Now,
an
attachment
to
Harriet
Smith
would
have
nothing
to
encounter.
Mr.
Churchill,
independent
of
his
wife,
was
feared
by
nobody;
an
easy,
guidable
man,
to
be
persuaded
into
any
thing
by
his
nephew.
All
that
remained
to
be
wished
was,
that
the
nephew
should
form
the
attachment,
as,
with
all
her
goodwill
in
the
cause,
Emma
could
feel
no
