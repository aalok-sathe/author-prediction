obliged
to
leave
the
door
ajar
as
she
found
it;
but
she
fully
intended
that
Mr.
Elton
should
close
it.
It
was
not
closed,
however,
it
still
remained
ajar;
but
by
engaging
the
housekeeper
in
incessant
conversation,
she
hoped
to
make
it
practicable
for
him
to
chuse
his
own
subject
in
the
adjoining
room.
For
ten
minutes
she
could
hear
nothing
but
herself.
It
could
be
protracted
no
longer.
She
was
then
obliged
to
be
finished,
and
make
her
appearance.
The
lovers
were
standing
together
at
one
of
the
windows.
It
had
a
most
favourable
aspect;
and,
for
half
a
minute,
Emma
felt
the
glory
of
having
schemed
successfully.
But
it
would
not
do;
he
had
not
come
to
the

He
had
been
most
agreeable,
most
delightful;
he
had
told
Harriet
that
he
had
seen
them
go
by,
and
had
purposely
followed
them;
other
little
gallantries
and
allusions
had
been
dropt,
but
nothing
serious.
"Cautious,
very
cautious,"
thought
Emma;
"he
advances
inch
by
inch,
and
will
hazard
nothing
till
he
believes
himself
secure."
Still,
however,
though
every
thing
had
not
been
accomplished
by
her
ingenious
device,
she
could
not
but
flatter
herself
that
it
had
been
the
occasion
of
