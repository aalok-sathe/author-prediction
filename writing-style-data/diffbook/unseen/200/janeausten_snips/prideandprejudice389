did
she
come?
Or,
why
did
he
thus
come
a
day
before
he
was
expected?
Had
they
been
only
ten
minutes
sooner,
they
should
have
been
beyond
the
reach
of
his
discrimination;
for
it
was
plain
that
he
was
that

or
his
carriage.
She
blushed
again
and
again
over
the
perverseness
of
the
meeting.
And
his
behaviour,
so
strikingly
altered
what
could
it

he
put
his
letter
into
her
hand!
She
knew
not
what
to
think,
or
how
to
account
for
it.
They
had
now
entered
a
beautiful
walk
by
the
side
of
the
water,
and
every
step
was
bringing
forward
a
nobler
fall
of
ground,
or
a
finer
reach
of
the
woods
to
which
they
were
approaching;
but
it
was
some
time
before
Elizabeth
was
sensible
of
any

it;
and,
