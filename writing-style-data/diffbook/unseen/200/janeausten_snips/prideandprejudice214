wrong,
and
me
most
unhappy.
Do
not
distress
me
by
the
idea.
I
am
not
ashamed
of
having
been
mistaken
or,
at
least,
it
is
light,
it
is
nothing
in
comparison
of
what
I
should
feel
in
thinking
ill
of
him
or
his
sisters.
Let
me
take
it
in
the
best
light,
in
the
light
in
which
it
may
be
understood."
Elizabeth
could
not
oppose
such
a
wish;
and
from
this
time
Mr.
Bingley's
name
was
scarcely
ever
mentioned
between
them.
Mrs.
Bennet
still
continued
to
wonder
and
repine
at
his
returning
no
more,
and
though
a
day
seldom
passed
in
which
Elizabeth
did
not
account
for
it
clearly,
there
was
little
chance
of
her
ever
considering
it
with
less
perplexity.
Her
daughter
endeavoured
to
convince
her
of
what
she
did
not
believe
herself,
that
his
attentions
to
Jane
had
been
merely
the
effect
of
a
common
and
transient
liking,
which
ceased
when
he
saw
her
no
more;
but
though
the
probability
of
the
statement
was
admitted
at
the
time,
she
had
the
same
story
to
repeat
every
day.
Mrs.
Bennet's
best
comfort
was
that
Mr.
Bingley
must
be
down
again
in
the
summer.
Mr.
Bennet
treated
the
matter
differently.
