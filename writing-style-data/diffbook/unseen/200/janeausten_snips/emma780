he
only
hoped
"the
young
lady's
pride
would
now
be
contented;"
and
supposed
"she
had
always
meant
to
catch
Knightley
if
she
could;"
and,
on
the
point
of
living
at
Hartfield,
could
daringly
exclaim,
"Rather
he
than
I!"
But
Mrs.
Elton
was
very
much
discomposed
indeed.
"Poor
Knightley!
poor
fellow!
sad
business
for
him."
She
was
extremely
concerned;
for,
though
very
eccentric,
he
had
a
thousand
good
qualities.
How
could
he
be
so
taken
in?
Did
not
think
him
at
all
in
love
not
in
the
least.
Poor
Knightley!
There
would
be
an
end
of
all
pleasant
intercourse
with
him.
How
happy
he
had
been
to
come
and
dine
with
them
whenever
they
asked
him!
But
that
would
be
all
over
now.
Poor
fellow!
No
more
exploring
parties
to
Donwell
made
for
her.
Oh!
no;
there
would
be
a
Mrs.
Knightley
to
throw
cold
water
on
every
thing.
Extremely
disagreeable!
But
she
was
not
at
all
sorry
that
she
had
abused
the
housekeeper
the
other
day.
Shocking
plan,
living
together.
It
would
never
do.
She
knew
a
family
near
Maple
Grove
who
had
tried
it,
and
been
obliged
to
separate
before
the
end
of
the
first
quarter.
Time
passed
on.
