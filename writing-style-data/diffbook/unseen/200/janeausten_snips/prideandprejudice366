direction,
may
be
of
service,
if
not
to
himself,
to
many
others,
for
it
must
only
deter
him
from
such
foul
misconduct
as
I
have
suffered
by.
I
only
fear
that
the
sort
of
cautiousness
to
which
you,
I
imagine,
have
been
alluding,
is
merely
adopted
on
his
visits
to
his
aunt,
of
whose
good
opinion
and
judgement
he
stands
much
in
awe.
His
fear
of
her
has
always
operated,
I
know,
when
they
were
together;
and
a
good
deal
is
to
be
imputed
to
his
wish
of
forwarding
the
match
with
Miss
de
Bourgh,
which
I
am
certain
he
has
very
much
at
heart."
Elizabeth
could
not
repress
a
smile
at
this,
but
she
answered
only
by
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head.
She
saw
that
he
wanted
to
engage
her
on
the
old
subject
of
his
grievances,
and
she
was
in
no
humour
to
indulge
him.
The
rest
of
the
evening
passed
with
the
appearance,
on
his
side,
of
usual
cheerfulness,
but
with
no
further
attempt
to
distinguish
Elizabeth;
and
they
parted
at
last
with
mutual
civility,
and
possibly
a
mutual
desire
of
never
meeting
again.
When
the
party
broke
up,
Lydia
returned
with
Mrs.
Forster
to
Meryton,
