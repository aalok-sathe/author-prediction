I
should
have
expected
better
judgment
in
Colonel
Campbell."
From
that
moment,
Emma
could
have
taken
her
oath
that
Mr.
Knightley
had
had
no
concern
in
giving
the
instrument.
But
whether
he
were
entirely
free
from
peculiar
attachment
whether
there
were
no
actual
preference
remained
a
little
longer
doubtful.
Towards
the
end
of
Jane's
second
song,
her
voice
grew
thick.
"That
will
do,"
said
he,
when
it
was
finished,
thinking
aloud
"you
have
sung
quite
enough
for
one
evening
now
be
quiet."
Another
song,
however,
was
soon
begged
for.
"One
more;
they
would
not
fatigue
Miss
Fairfax
on
any
account,
and
would
only
ask
for
one
more."
And
Frank
Churchill
was
heard
to
say,
"I
think
you
could
manage
this
without
effort;
the
first
part
is
so
very
trifling.
The
strength
of
the
song
falls
on
the
second."
Mr.
Knightley
grew
angry.
"That
fellow,"
said
he,
indignantly,
"thinks
of
nothing
but
shewing
off
his
own
voice.
This
must
not
be."
And
touching
Miss
Bates,
who
at
that
moment
passed
near
"Miss
Bates,
are
you
mad,
to
let
your
niece
sing
herself
hoarse
in
this
manner?
Go,
and
interfere.
They
have
no
mercy
on
her."
Miss
Bates,
in
her
real
anxiety
