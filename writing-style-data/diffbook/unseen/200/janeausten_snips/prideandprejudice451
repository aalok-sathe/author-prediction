especially
on
Lydia's
side,
but
nothing
to
give
him
any
alarm.
I
am
so
grieved
for
him!
His
behaviour
was
attentive
and
kind
to
the
utmost.
He
was
coming
to
us,
in
order
to
assure
us
of
his
concern,
before
he
had
any
idea
of
their
not
being
gone
to
Scotland:
when
that
apprehension
first
got
abroad,
it
hastened
his

"And
was
Denny

not
one
of
you
entertained
a
doubt,
I
suppose,
of
their
being
really
married?"
"How
was
it
possible
that
such
an
idea
should
enter
our
brains?
I
felt
a
little
uneasy
a
little
fearful
of
my
sister's
happiness
with
him
in
marriage,
because
I
knew
that
his
conduct
had
not
been
always
quite

My
father
and
mother
knew
