till
Midsummer,
and
fresh
invitations
had
arrived
for
her
to
join
them
there.
According
to
Miss
Bates
it
all
came
from
her
Mrs.
Dixon
had
written
most
pressingly.
Would
Jane
but
go,
means
were
to
be
found,
servants
sent,
friends
contrived
no
travelling
difficulty
allowed
to
exist;
but
still
she
had
declined

subject,
before
the
few
who
knew
her
opinion
of
Mrs.
Elton,
Mrs.
Weston
ventured
this
apology
for
Jane.
"We
cannot
suppose
that
she
has
any
great
enjoyment
at
the
Vicarage,
my
dear
Emma
but
it
is
better
than
being
always

Her
aunt
is
a
good

but,
as
a
constant

very
tiresome.
We
must
consider

Miss
Fairfax
