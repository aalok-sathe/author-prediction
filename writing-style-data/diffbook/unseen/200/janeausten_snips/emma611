thing,"
cried
Mrs.
Elton
emphatically,
"which
I
should
not
have
thought
myself
privileged
to
inquire
into.
Though,
perhaps,
as
the
Chaperon
of
the
party
I
never
was
in
any
circle
exploring
parties
young
ladies
married
women
"
Her
mutterings
were
chiefly
to
her
husband;
and
he
murmured,
in
reply,
"Very
true,
my
love,
very
true.
Exactly
so,
indeed
quite
unheard
of
but
some
ladies
say
any
thing.
Better
pass
it
off
as
a
joke.
Every
body
knows
what
is
due
to
you."
"It
will
not
do,"
whispered
Frank
to
Emma;
"they
are
most
of
them
affronted.
I
will
attack
them
with
more
address.
Ladies
and
gentlemen
I
am
ordered
by
Miss
Woodhouse
to
say,
that
she
waives
her
right
of
knowing
exactly
what
you
may
all
be
thinking
of,
and
only
requires
something
very
entertaining
from
each
of
you,
in
a
general
way.
Here
are
seven
of
you,
besides
myself,
(who,
she
is
pleased
to
say,
am
very
entertaining
already,)
and
she
only
demands
from
each
of
you
either
one
thing
very
clever,
be
it
prose
or
verse,
original
or
repeated
or
two
things
moderately
clever
or
three
things
very
dull
indeed,
and
she
engages
to
laugh
heartily
at
them
