agreeable,
he
would
have
talked
to
Mrs.
Long.
But
I
can
guess
how
it
was;
everybody
says
that
he
is
eat
up
with
pride,
and
I
dare
say
he
had
heard
somehow
that
Mrs.
Long
does
not
keep
a
carriage,
and
had
come
to
the
ball
in
a
hack
chaise."
"I
do
not
mind
his
not
talking
to
Mrs.
Long,"
said
Miss
Lucas,
"but
I
wish

with
family,
fortune,
everything
in
his
favour,
should
think
highly
of
himself.
If
I
may
so
express
it,
he
has
a
right
to
be
proud."
"That
is
very
true,"
replied
Elizabeth,
"and
I
could
easily
forgive
his
pride,
if
he
had
not
mortified
mine."
"Pride,"
observed
Mary,
who
piqued
herself
upon
the
solidity
of
her
reflections,
"is
a
very
common
failing,
I
believe.
