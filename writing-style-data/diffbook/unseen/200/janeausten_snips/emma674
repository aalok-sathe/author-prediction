appear
.
But
you
know
they
were
your
own
words,
that
more
wonderful
things
had
happened,
matches
of
greater
disparity
had
taken
place
than
between
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
and
me;
and,
therefore,
it
seems
as
if
such
a
thing
even
as
this,
may
have
occurred
before
and
if
I
should
be
so
fortunate,
beyond
expression,
as
to
if
Mr.
Knightley
should
really
if
he
does
not

I
hope,
dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
you
will

"Yes,"

Harriet
modestly,
but
not
fearfully
"I
must
say
that
I
have."
Emma's
eyes
were
instantly
withdrawn;
and
she
sat
silently
meditating,
in
a
fixed
attitude,
for
a
few
minutes.
A
few
minutes
were
sufficient
for
making
her
acquainted
with
her
own
heart.
A
mind
like
hers,
once
opening
to
suspicion,
made
rapid
progress.
She
touched

admitted
she
acknowledged
the
whole
truth.
Why
was
it
so
much
worse
