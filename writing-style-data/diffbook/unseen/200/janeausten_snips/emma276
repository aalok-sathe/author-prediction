not

I
think
you
understand
me,
therefore."
An
arch
look
expressed
"I
understand
you
well
enough;"
but
she
said
only,
"Miss
Fairfax
is
reserved."
"I
always
told
you
she
was
a
little;
but
you
will
soon
overcome
all
that
part
of
her
reserve
which
ought
to
be
overcome,
all
that
has
its
foundation
in
diffidence.
What
arises
from
discretion
must
be
honoured."

think
her
diffident.
I
do
not
see
it."

dear
Emma,"
said
he,

from

into
one
close
by
her,

me,

that

had
not

pleasant
evening."
"Oh!
no;
I
was
pleased
with
my
own
perseverance
in
asking
questions;
and
amused

think
how
little
information
I

"I
am
disappointed,"
was
his
only
answer.
"I
hope
every
body
had
a
pleasant
evening,"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse,
in
his
quiet
way.
"I
had.
Once,
I
felt
the
fire
rather
too
much;
but
then
I
moved
back
my
chair
a
little,
a
very
little,
and
it
did
not
disturb
me.
Miss
Bates

she

is,

she
