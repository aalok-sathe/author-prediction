will
there
be
good
room
for
five
couple?
I
really
do
not
think
there
will."
On
another,
"And
after
all,
five
couple
are
not
enough
to
make
it
worth
while
to
stand
up.
Five
couple
are
nothing,
when
one
thinks
seriously
about
it.
It
will
not
do
to
invite
five
couple.
It
can
be
allowable
only
as
the
thought
of
the
moment."
Somebody
said
that
Miss
Gilbert
was
expected
at
her
brother's,
and
must
be
invited
with
the
rest.
Somebody
else
believed
Mrs.
Gilbert
would
have
danced
the
other
evening,
if
she
had
been
asked.
A
word
was
put
in
for
a
second
young
Cox;
and
at
last,
Mr.
Weston
naming
one
family
of
cousins
who
must
be
included,
and
another
of
very
old
acquaintance
who
could
not
be
left
out,
it
became
a
certainty
that
the
five
couple
would
be
at
least
ten,
and
a
very
interesting
speculation
in
what
possible
manner
they
could
be
disposed
of.
The
doors
of
the
two
rooms
were
just
opposite
each
other.
"Might
not
they
use
both
rooms,
and
dance
across
the
passage?"
It
seemed
the
best
scheme;
and
yet
it
was
not
so
good
but
that
many
of
them
wanted
a
better.
