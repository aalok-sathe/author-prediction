am
very
glad
I
did
think
of
her.
It
was
very
lucky,
for
I
would
not
have
had
poor
James
think
himself
slighted
upon
any
account;
and
I
am
sure
she
will
make
a
very
good
servant:
she
is
a
civil,
pretty
spoken
girl;
I
have
a
great
opinion
of
her.
Whenever
I
see
her,
she
always
curtseys
and
asks
me
how
I
do,
in
a
very
pretty
manner;
and
when
you
have
had
her
here
to
do
needlework,
I
observe
she
always
turns
the
lock
of
the
door
the
right
way
and
never
bangs
it.
I
am
sure
she
will
be
an
excellent
servant;
and
it
will
be
a
great
comfort
to
poor
Miss
Taylor
to
have
somebody
about
her
that
she
is
used
to
see.
Whenever
James
goes
over
to
see
his
daughter,
you
know,
she
will
be
hearing
of
us.
He
will
be
able
to
tell
her
how
we
all
are."
Emma
spared
no
exertions
to
maintain
this
happier
flow
of
ideas,
and
hoped,
by
the
help
of
backgammon,
to
get
her
father
tolerably
through
the
evening,
and
be
attacked
by
no
regrets
but
her
own.
The
backgammon
table
was
placed;
but

visitor
