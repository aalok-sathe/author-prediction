to
me,
but
it
is
not
your
being
ten
years
older
than
myself
which
makes
the
difference,
it
is
not
age,
but
situation.
You
have
every
body
dearest
to
you
always
at
hand,
I,
probably,
never
shall
again;
and
therefore
till
I
have
outlived
all
my
affections,
a
post
office,
I
think,
must
always
have
power
to
draw
me
out,
in
worse
weather
than
to
day."
"When
I
talked
of
your
being
altered
by
time,
by
the
progress
of
years,"
said
John
Knightley,
"I
meant
to
imply
the
change
of
situation
which
time
usually
brings.
I
consider
one
as
including
the
other.
Time
will
generally
lessen
the
interest
of
every
attachment
not
within
the
daily
circle
but
that
is
not
the
change
I
had
in
view
for
you.
As
an
old
friend,
you
will
allow
me
to
hope,
Miss
Fairfax,
that
ten
years
hence
you
may
have
as
many
concentrated
objects
as
I
have."
It
was
kindly
said,
and
very
far
from
giving
offence.
A
pleasant
"thank
you"
seemed
meant
to
laugh
it
off,
but
a
blush,
a
quivering
lip,
a
tear
in
the
eye,
shewed
that
it
was
felt
beyond
a
laugh.
Her
attention
was
now
claimed
by
Mr.
