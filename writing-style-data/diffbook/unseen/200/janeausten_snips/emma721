to
have
her
removed
just
now
for
a
time
from
Highbury,
and
indulging
in
one
scheme
more
nearly
resolve,
that
it
might
be
practicable
to
get
an
invitation
for
her
to
Brunswick
Square.
Isabella
had
been
pleased
with
Harriet;
and
a
few
weeks
spent
in
London
must
give
her
some
amusement.
She
did
not
think
it
in
Harriet's
nature
to
escape
being
benefited
by
novelty
and
variety,
by
the
streets,
the
shops,
and
the
children.
At
any
rate,
it
would
be
a
proof
of
attention
and
kindness
in
herself,
from
whom
every
thing
was
due;
a
separation
for
the
present;
an
averting
of
the
evil
day,
when
they
must
all
be
together
again.
She
rose
early,
and
wrote
her
letter
to
Harriet;
an
employment
which
left
her
so
very
serious,
so
nearly
sad,
that
Mr.
Knightley,
in
walking
up
to
Hartfield
to
breakfast,
did
not
arrive
at
all
too
soon;
and
half
an
hour
stolen
afterwards
to
go
over
the
same
ground
again
with
him,
literally
and
figuratively,
was
quite
necessary
to
reinstate
her
in
a
proper
share
of
the
happiness
of
the
evening
before.
He
had
not
left
her
long,
by
no
means
long
enough
for
her
to
have
