no
change
in
their
numbers
or
their
comforts
but
for
the
better;
and
she
was
very
sure
that
he
would
be
a
great
deal
the
happier
for
having
Mr.
Knightley
always
at
hand,
when
he
were
once
got
used
to
the
idea.
Did
he
not
love
Mr.
Knightley
very
much?
He
would
not
deny
that
he
did,
she
was
sure.
Whom
did
he
ever
want
to
consult
on
business
but
Mr.
Knightley?
Who
was
so
useful
to
him,
who
so
ready
to
write
his
letters,
who
so
glad
to
assist
him?
Who
so
cheerful,
so
attentive,
so
attached
to
him?

not
he
like
to
have
him
always
on
the
spot?
Yes.
That
was
all
very
true.
Mr.
Knightley
could
not
be
there
too
often;
he
should
be
glad
to
see
him
every
day;
but
they
did
see
him
every
day
as
it
was.
Why
could
not
they
go
on
as
they
had
done?
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
not
be
soon
reconciled;
but
the
worst
was
overcome,
the
idea
was
given;
time
and
continual
repetition
must
do
the
rest.
To
Emma's
entreaties
and
assurances
succeeded
Mr.
Knightley's,
whose
fond
praise
of
her
gave
the
subject
even
a
kind
of
welcome;
and
