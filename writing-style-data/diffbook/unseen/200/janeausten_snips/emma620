I
could
allow
much
for
the
occasional
prevalence
of
the
ridiculous
over
the
good.
Were
she
a
woman
of
fortune,
I
would
leave
every
harmless
absurdity
to
take
its
chance,
I
would
not
quarrel
with
you
for
any
liberties
of
manner.
Were
she
your
equal
in
situation
but,
Emma,
consider
how
far
this
is
from
being
the
case.
She
is
poor;
she
has
sunk
from
the
comforts
she
was
born
to;
and,
if
she
live
to
old
age,
must
probably
sink
more.
Her
situation
should
secure
your
compassion.
It
was
badly
done,
indeed!
You,
whom
she
had
known
from
an
infant,
whom
she
had
seen
grow
up
from
a
period
when
her
notice
was
an
honour,
to
have
you
now,
in
thoughtless
spirits,
and
the
pride
of
the
moment,
laugh
at
her,
humble
her
and
before
her
niece,
too
and
before
others,
many
of
whom
(certainly
some,)
would
be
entirely
guided
by
your
treatment
of
her.
This
is
not
pleasant
to
you,
Emma
and
it
is
very
far
from
pleasant
to
me;
but
I
must,
I
will,
I
will
tell
you
truths
while
I
can;
satisfied
with
proving
myself
your
friend
by
very
faithful
counsel,
and
trusting
that
you
will
