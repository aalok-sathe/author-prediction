spent
at
Donwell?
There
every
little
dissatisfaction
that
had
occurred
before
came
to
a
crisis.
I
was
late;
I
met
her
walking
home
by
herself,
and
wanted
to
walk
with
her,
but
she
would
not
suffer
it.
She
absolutely
refused
to
allow
me,
which
I
then
thought
most
unreasonable.
Now,
however,
I
see
nothing
in
it
but
a
very
natural
and
consistent
degree
of
discretion.
While
I,
to
blind
the
world
to
our
engagement,
was
behaving
one
hour
with
objectionable
particularity
to
another
woman,
was
she
to
be
consenting
the
next
to
a
proposal
which
might
have
made
every
previous
caution
useless?
Had
we
been
met
walking
together
between
Donwell
and
Highbury,
the
truth
must
have
been
suspected.
I
was
mad
enough,
however,
to
resent.
I
doubted
her
affection.
I
doubted
it
more
the
next
day
on
Box
Hill;
when,
provoked
by
such
conduct
on
my
side,
such
shameful,
insolent
neglect
of
her,
and
such
apparent
devotion
to
Miss
W.,
as
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
any
woman
of
sense
to
endure,
she
spoke
her
resentment
in
a
form
of
words
perfectly
intelligible
to
me.
In
short,
my
dear
madam,
it
was
a
quarrel
blameless
on
her
side,
abominable
