married.
It
was
an
encouragement
of
vice;
and
had
I
been
the
rector
of
Longbourn,
I
should
very
strenuously
have
opposed
it.
You
ought
certainly
to
forgive
them,
as
a
Christian,
but
never
to
admit
them
in
your
sight,
or
allow
their
names
to
be
mentioned
in
your
hearing.'

But
it
is
so
strange!"
"Yes
that
is
what
makes
it
amusing.
Had
they
fixed

any
other
man
it
would
have
been
nothing;
but
his
perfect
indifference,
and
your
pointed
dislike,
make
it
so
delightfully
absurd!
Much
as
I
abominate
writing,
I
would
not
give
up
