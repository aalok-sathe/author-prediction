"There
was
just
such
an
informality
in
the
terms
of
the
bequest
as
to
give
me
no
hope
from
law.
A
man
of
honour
could
not
have
doubted
the
intention,
but
Mr.
Darcy
chose
to
doubt
it
or
to
treat
it
as
a
merely
conditional
recommendation,
and
to
assert
that
I
had
forfeited
all
claim
to
it
by
extravagance,
imprudence
in
short
anything
or
nothing.
Certain
it
is,
that
the
living
became
vacant
two
years
ago,
exactly
as
I
was
of
an
age
to
hold
it,
and
that
it
was
given
to
another
man;
and
no
less
certain
is
it,
that
I
cannot
accuse
myself
of
having
really
done
anything
to
deserve
to
lose
it.
I
have
a
warm,
unguarded
temper,
and
I
may
have
spoken
my
opinion
of
him,
and
to
him,
too
freely.
I
can
recall
nothing
worse.
But
the
fact
is,
that
we
are
very
different
sort
of
men,
and
that
he
hates
me."
"This
is
quite
shocking!
He
deserves
to
be
publicly
disgraced."
"Some
time
or
other
he
will
be
but
it
shall
not
be
by
me.
Till
I
can
forget
his
father,
I
can
never
defy
or
expose
him."
