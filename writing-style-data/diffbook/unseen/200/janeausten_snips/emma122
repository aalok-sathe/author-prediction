the
week.
And
so
excellent
in
the
Church!
Miss
Nash
has
put
down
all
the
texts
he
has
ever
preached
from
since
he
came
to
Highbury.
Dear
me!
When
I
look
back
to
the
first
time
I
saw
him!
How
little
did
I
think!
The
two
Abbots
and
I
ran
into
the
front
room
and
peeped
through
the
blind
when
we
heard
he
was
going
by,
and
Miss
Nash
came
and
scolded
us
away,
and
staid
to
look
through
herself;
however,
she
called
me
back
presently,
and
let
me
look
too,
which
was
very
good
natured.
And
how
beautiful
we
thought
he
looked!
He
was
arm
in
arm
with
Mr.
Cole."
"This
is
an
alliance
which,
whoever
whatever
your
friends
may
be,
must
be
agreeable
to
them,
provided
at
least
they
have
common
sense;
and
we
are
not
to
be
addressing
our
conduct
to
fools.
If
they
are
anxious
to
see
you
happily
married,
here
is
a
man
whose
amiable
character
gives
every
assurance
of
it;
if
they
wish
to
have
you
settled
in
the
same
country
and
circle
which
they
have
chosen
to
place
you
in,
here
it
will
be
accomplished;
and
if
their
only
object
is
that
you
