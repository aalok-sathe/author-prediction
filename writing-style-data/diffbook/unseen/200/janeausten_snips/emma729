Let
me
hear
from
you
without
delay;
I
am
impatient
for
a
thousand
particulars.
Remember
how
few
minutes
I
was
at
Randalls,
and
in
how
bewildered,
how
mad
a
state:
and
I
am
not
much
better
yet;
still
insane
either
from
happiness
or
misery.
When
I
think
of
the
kindness
and
favour
I
have
met
with,
of
her
excellence
and
patience,
and
my
uncle's
generosity,
I
am
mad
with
joy:
but
when
I
recollect
all
the
uneasiness
I
occasioned
her,
and
how
little
I
deserve
to
be
forgiven,
I
am
mad
with
anger.
If
I
could
but
see
her
again!
But
I
must
not
propose
it
yet.
My
uncle
has
been
too
good
for
me
to
encroach.
I
must
still
add
to
this
long
letter.
You
have
not
heard
all
that
you
ought
to
hear.
I
could
not
give
any
connected
detail
yesterday;
but
the
suddenness,
and,
in
one
light,
the
unseasonableness
with
which
the
affair
burst
out,
needs
explanation;
for
though
the
event
of
the
26th
ult.,
as
you
will
conclude,
immediately
opened
to
me
the
happiest
prospects,
I
should
not
have
presumed
on
such
early
measures,
but
from
the
very
particular
circumstances,
which
left
me
not
an
hour
