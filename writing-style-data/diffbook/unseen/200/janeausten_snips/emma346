sit
up
for
her;
and
that
Serle
and
the
butler
should
see
that
every
thing
were
safe
in
the
house,
as
usual.
Frank
Churchill
came
back
again;
and
if
he
kept
his
father's
dinner
waiting,
it
was
not
known
at
Hartfield;
for
Mrs.
Weston
was
too
anxious
for
his
being
a
favourite
with
Mr.
Woodhouse,
to
betray
any
imperfection
which
could
be
concealed.
He
came
back,
had
had
his
hair
cut,
and
laughed
at
himself
with
a
very
good
grace,
but
without
seeming
really
at
all
ashamed
of
what
he
had
done.
He
had
no
reason
to
wish
his
hair
longer,
to
conceal
any
confusion
of
face;
no
reason
to
wish
the
money
unspent,
to
improve
his
spirits.
He
was
quite
as
undaunted
and
as
lively
as
ever;
and,
after
seeing
him,
Emma
thus
moralised
to
herself:
"I
do
not
know
whether
it
ought
to
be
so,
but
certainly
silly
things
do
cease
to
be
silly
if
they
are
done
by
sensible
people
in
an
impudent
way.
Wickedness
is
always
wickedness,
but
folly
is
not
always
folly.
It
depends
upon
the
character
of
those
who
handle
it.
Mr.
Knightley,
he
is
not
a
trifling,
silly
young
man.
If
he
were,
