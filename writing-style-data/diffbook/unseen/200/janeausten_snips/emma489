Emma's
hand
is
the
strongest."
"Isabella
and
Emma
both
write
beautifully,"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse;
"and
always
did.
And
so
does
poor
Mrs.
Weston"
with
half
a
sigh
and
half
a
smile
at
her.
"I
never
saw
any
gentleman's
handwriting"
Emma
began,
looking
also
at
Mrs.
Weston;
but
stopped,
on
perceiving
that
Mrs.
Weston
was
attending
to
some
one
else
and
the
pause
gave
her
time
to
reflect,
"Now,
how
am
I
going
to
introduce
him?
Am
I
unequal
to
speaking
his
name
at
once
before
all
these
people?
Is
it
necessary
for
me
to
use
any
roundabout
phrase?
Your
Yorkshire
friend
your
correspondent
in
Yorkshire;
that
would
be
the
way,
I
suppose,
if
I
were
very
bad.
No,
I
can
pronounce
his
name
without
the
smallest
distress.
I
certainly
get
better
and
better.
Now
for
it."
Mrs.
Weston
was
disengaged
and
Emma
began
again
"Mr.
Frank
Churchill
writes
one
of
the
best
gentleman's
hands
I
ever
saw."
"I
do
not
admire
it,"
said
Mr.
Knightley.
"It
is
too
small
wants
strength.
It
is
like
a
woman's
writing."
This
was
not
submitted
to
by
either
lady.
They
vindicated
him
against
the
base
aspersion.
"No,
it
by
no
means
wanted
strength
