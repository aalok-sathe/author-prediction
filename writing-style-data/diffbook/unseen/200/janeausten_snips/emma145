she
was
the
more
concerned
at
it,
from
their
being
evidently
in
a
conversation
which
interested
them.
Mr.
Elton
was
speaking
with
animation,
Harriet
listening
with
a
very
pleased
attention;
and
Emma,
having
sent
the
child
on,
was
beginning
to
think
how
she
might
draw
back
a
little
more,
when
they
both
looked
around,
and
she
was
obliged
to
join
them.
Mr.
Elton
was
still
talking,
still
engaged
in
some
interesting
detail;
and
Emma
experienced
some
disappointment
when
she
found
that
he
was
only
giving
his
fair
companion
an
account
of
the
yesterday's
party
at
his
friend
Cole's,
and
that
she
was
come
in
herself
for
the
Stilton
cheese,
the
north
Wiltshire,
the
butter,
the
celery,
the
beet
root,
and
all
the
dessert.
"This
would
soon
have
led
to
something
better,
of
course,"
was
her
consoling
reflection;
"any
thing
interests
between
those
who
love;
and
any
thing
will
serve
as
introduction
to
what
is
near
the
heart.
If
I
could
but
have
kept
longer
away!"
They
now
walked
on
together
quietly,
till
within
view
of
the
vicarage
pales,
when
a
sudden
resolution,
of
at
least
getting
Harriet
into
the
house,
made
her
again
find
something
very
much
amiss
about
her
