he
made
a
point
of
it.
It
is
too
unlikely,
for
me
to
believe
it
without
proof."
"How
odd
you
are!
What
has
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
done,
to
make
you
suppose
him
such
an
unnatural
creature?"
"I
am
not
supposing
him
at
all
an
unnatural
creature,
in
suspecting
that
he
may
have
learnt
to
be
above
his
connexions,
and
to
care
very
little
for
any
thing
but
his
own
pleasure,
from
living
with
those
who
have
always
set
him
the
example
of
it.
It
is
a
great
deal
more
natural
than
one
could
wish,
that
a
young
man,
brought
up
by
those
who
are
proud,
luxurious,
and
selfish,
should
be
proud,
luxurious,
and
selfish
too.
If
Frank
Churchill
had
wanted
to
see
his
father,
he
would
have
contrived
it
between
September
and
January.
A
man
at
his
age
what
is
he?
three
or
four
and
twenty
cannot
be
without
the
means
of
doing
as
much
as
that.
It
is
impossible."
"That's
easily
said,
and
easily
felt
by
you,
who
have
always
been
your
own
master.
You
are
the
worst
judge
in
the
world,
Mr.
Knightley,
of
the
difficulties
of
dependence.
You
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
have
tempers
