of
that
kind
here,
I
suppose,
Miss
Woodhouse,
every
summer?"
"No;
not
immediately
here.
We
are
rather
out
of
distance
of
the
very
striking
beauties
which
attract
the
sort
of
parties
you
speak
of;
and
we
are
a
very
quiet
set
of
people,
I
believe;
more
disposed
to
stay
at
home
than
engage
in
schemes
of
pleasure."
"Ah!
there
is
nothing
like
staying
at

for
real
comfort.
Nobody
can
be
more
devoted

I
was
quite
a
proverb
for
it
at
Maple
Grove.
Many

Augusta,
I
believe,
with
her
own
good
will,
would
never
stir
beyond
the
park
paling.'
Many
a
time
has
she
said
so;
and
yet
I
am
no
advocate
for
entire
seclusion.
I
think,
on
the
contrary,
when
people
shut
themselves
up
entirely
from
society,
it
is
a
very
bad
thing;
and
that
it
is
much
more
advisable
to
mix

the
world

a
proper
degree,
