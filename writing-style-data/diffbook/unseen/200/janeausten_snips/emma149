bathing
for
the
children,
and
it
was
therefore
many
months
since
they
had
been
seen
in
a
regular
way
by
their
Surry
connexions,
or
seen
at
all
by
Mr.
Woodhouse,
who
could
not
be
induced
to
get
so
far
as
London,
even
for
poor
Isabella's
sake;
and
who
consequently
was
now
most
nervously
and
apprehensively
happy
in
forestalling
this
too
short
visit.
He
thought
much
of
the
evils
of
the
journey
for
her,
and
not
a
little
of
the
fatigues
of
his
own
horses
and
coachman
who
were
to
bring
some
of
the
party
the
last
half
of
the
way;
but
his
alarms
were
needless;
the
sixteen
miles
being
happily
accomplished,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Knightley,
their
five
children,
and
a
competent
number
of
nursery
maids,
all
reaching
Hartfield
in
safety.
The
bustle
and
joy
of
such
an
arrival,
the
many
to
be
talked
to,
welcomed,
encouraged,
and
variously
dispersed
and
disposed
of,
produced
a
noise
and
confusion
which
his
nerves
could
not
have
borne
under
any
other
cause,
nor
have
endured
much
longer
even
for
this;
but
the
ways
of
Hartfield
and
the
feelings
of
her
father
were
so
respected
by
Mrs.
John
Knightley,
that
in
spite
of
