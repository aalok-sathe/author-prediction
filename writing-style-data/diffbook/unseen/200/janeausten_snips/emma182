With
men
he
can
be
rational
and
unaffected,
but
when
he
has
ladies
to
please,
every
feature
works."
"Mr.
Elton's
manners
are
not
perfect,"
replied
Emma;
"but
where
there
is
a
wish
to
please,
one
ought
to
overlook,
and
one
does
overlook
a
great
deal.
Where
a
man
does
his
best
with
only
moderate
powers,
he
will
have
the
advantage
over
negligent
superiority.
There
is
such
perfect
good
temper
and
good
will
in
Mr.
Elton
as
one
cannot
but

said
Mr.
John
Knightley
presently,
with
some
slyness,
"he
seems
to
have
a
great
deal
of
good

replied
with
a
smile
of
astonishment,
"are
you
imagining
me
to
be
Mr.
Elton's

imagination
has
crossed
me,

Emma;
and
if
it
never
occurred
to
you
before,
you
may
as
well
take
it
into
consideration
now."
"Mr.
Elton
in
love
with
me!
What
an
idea!"
"I
do
not
say
it
is
so;
but
you
will
do
well
to
consider
whether
it
is
so
or
not,
and
to
regulate
your
behaviour
accordingly.
I
think
your
manners
to
him
encouraging.
I
speak
as
a
friend,
Emma.
You
had
better
look
about
you,
and
