look.
It
was
all
read,
however,
steadily,
attentively,
and
without
the
smallest
remark;
and,
excepting
one
momentary
glance
at
her,
instantly
withdrawn,
in
the
fear
of
giving
pain
no
remembrance
of
Box
Hill
seemed
to
exist.
"There
is
no
saying
much
for
the
delicacy
of
our
good
friends,
the
Eltons,"
was
his
next
observation.
"His
feelings
are
natural.
What!
actually
resolve
to
break
with
him
entirely!
She
felt
the
engagement
to
be
a
source
of
repentance
and
misery
to
each
she
dissolved
it.
What
a
view
this
gives
of
her
sense
of
his
behaviour!
Well,
he
must
be
a
most
extraordinary

"Nay,
nay,
read
on.
You
will
find
how
very
much
he
suffers."
"I
hope
he
does,"
replied
Mr.
Knightley
coolly,
and
resuming
the
letter.
"'Smallridge!'
What
does
this
mean?
What
is
all
this?"
"She
had
engaged
to
go
as
governess
to
Mrs.
Smallridge's
children
a
dear
friend
of
Mrs.
Elton's
a
neighbour
of
Maple
Grove;
and,
by
the
bye,
I
wonder
how
Mrs.
Elton
bears
the
disappointment?"
"Say
nothing,
my
dear
Emma,
while
you
oblige
me
to
read
not
even
of
Mrs.
Elton.
Only
one
page
more.
I
shall
soon
have
done.
What
a
letter
the
man
writes!"
