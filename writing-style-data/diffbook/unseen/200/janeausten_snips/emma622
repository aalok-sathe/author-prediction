heart.
How
could
she
have
been
so
brutal,
so
cruel
to
Miss
Bates!
How
could
she
have
exposed
herself
to
such
ill
opinion
in
any
one
she
valued!
And
how
suffer
him
to
leave
her
without
saying
one
word
of
gratitude,
of
concurrence,
of
common
kindness!
Time
did
not
compose
her.
As
she
reflected
more,
she
seemed
but
to
feel
it
more.
She
never
had
been
so
depressed.
Happily
it
was

considered
by
the
rest
of
the
party,
she
could
not
tell.
They,
in
their
different
homes,
and
their
different
ways,
might
be
looking
back
on
it
with
pleasure;
but
in
her
view
it
was
a
morning
more
completely
misspent,
more
totally
bare
of
rational
satisfaction
at
the
time,
and
more

be
abhorred
in
recollection,
