Mr.
Weston?
To
Bath,
or
to
Clifton?"
"She
has
taken
it
into
her
head
that
Enscombe
is
too
cold
for
her.
The
fact
is,
I
suppose,
that
she
is
tired
of
Enscombe.
She
has
now
been
a
longer
time
stationary
there,
than

It

retired."
"Aye
like
Maple
Grove,
I
dare

Nothing
can
stand

I

cannot
have
too
many
resources
and
I
feel
very
thankful
that
I
have
so
many
myself
as

"Frank
was
here
in
February
for
a
fortnight."
"So
I
remember

He
