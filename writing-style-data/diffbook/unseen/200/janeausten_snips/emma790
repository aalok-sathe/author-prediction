therefore,
an
immediate
excuse
for
disappearing.
The
joy,
the
gratitude,
the
exquisite
delight
of
her
sensations
may
be
imagined.
The
sole
grievance
and
alloy
thus
removed
in
the
prospect
of
Harriet's
welfare,
she
was
really
in
danger
of
becoming
too
happy
for
security.
What

Now

Every
thing
would
be
a
pleasure.
It
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
know
Robert
Martin.
High
in
the
rank
of
her
most
serious
and
heartfelt
felicities,
was
the
reflection
that
all
necessity
of
concealment
from
Mr.
Knightley
would
soon
be
over.
The
disguise,
equivocation,
mystery,
so
hateful
to
her
to
practise,
might
