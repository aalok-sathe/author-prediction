well
as
her
beauty;
when
she
considered
what
all
this
elegance
was
destined
to,
what
she
was
going
to
sink
from,
how
she
was
going
to
live,
it
seemed
impossible
to
feel
any
thing
but
compassion
and
respect;
especially,
if
to
every
well
known
particular
entitling
her
to
interest,
were
added
the
highly
probable
circumstance
of
an
attachment
to
Mr.
Dixon,
which
she
had
so
naturally
started
to
herself.
In
that
case,
nothing
could
be
more
pitiable
or
more
honourable
than
the
sacrifices
she
had
resolved
on.
Emma
was
very
willing

actions
from
his
wife,
or

any
thing
mischievous
which
her
imagination
had
suggested
at
first.
If
it
were
love,
it
might
be
simple,
single,
successless
love
on
her
side
alone.
She
might
have
been
unconsciously
sucking
in
the
sad
poison,
while
a
sharer
of
his
conversation
with
her
friend;
and
from
the
best,
the
purest
of
motives,
might
now
be
denying
herself
this
visit
to
Ireland,
and
resolving
to
divide
herself
effectually
from
him
and
his
connexions
by
soon
beginning
her
career
of
laborious
duty.
Upon
the
whole,
Emma
left
her
with
such
softened,
charitable
feelings,
as
made
