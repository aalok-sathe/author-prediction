expecting
more
good
than
occurs,
does
not
always
pay
for
its
hopes
by
any
proportionate
depression.
It
soon
flies
over
the
present
failure,
and
begins
to
hope
again.
For
half
an
hour
Mr.
Weston
was
surprized
and
sorry;
but
then
he
began
to
perceive
that
Frank's
coming
two
or
three
months
later
would
be
a
much
better
plan;
better
time
of
year;
better
weather;
and
that
he
would
be
able,
without
any
doubt,
to
stay
considerably
longer
with
them
than
if
he
had
come
sooner.
These
feelings
rapidly
restored
his
comfort,
while
Mrs.
Weston,
of
a
more
apprehensive
disposition,
foresaw
nothing
but
a
repetition
of
excuses
and
delays;
and
after
all
her
concern
for
what
her
husband
was
to
suffer,
suffered
a
great
deal
more
herself.
Emma
was
not
at
this
time
in
a
state
of
spirits
to
care
really
about
Mr.
Frank
Churchill's
not
coming,
except
as
a
disappointment
at
Randalls.
The
acquaintance
at
present
had
no
charm
for
her.
She
wanted,
rather,
to
be
quiet,
and
out
of
temptation;
but
still,
as
it
was
desirable
that
she
should
appear,
in
general,
like
her
usual
self,
she
took
care
to
express
as
much
interest
in
the
circumstance,
