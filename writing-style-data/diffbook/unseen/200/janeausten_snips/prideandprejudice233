Let
me
hear
from
you
very
soon.
Miss
Bingley
said
something
of
his
never
returning
to
Netherfield
again,
of
giving
up
the
house,
but
not
with
any
certainty.
We
had
better
not
mention
it.
I
am
extremely
glad
that
you
have
such
pleasant
accounts
from
our
friends
at
Hunsford.
Pray
go
to
see
them,
with
Sir
William
and
Maria.
I
am
sure
you
will
be
very
comfortable
there.
Yours,
etc."
This
letter
gave
Elizabeth
some
pain;
but
her
spirits
returned
as
she
considered
that
Jane
would
no
longer
be
duped,
by
the
sister
at
least.
All
expectation
from
the
brother
was
now
absolutely
over.
She
would
not
even
wish
for
a
renewal
of
his
attentions.
His
character

review
of
it;
and
as
a
punishment
for
him,
as
well
as
a
possible
advantage
to
Jane,
she
seriously
hoped
he
might
really
soon
marry
Mr.
Darcy's
sister,
as
by
Wickham's
account,
she
would
make
him
abundantly
regret
what
he
had
thrown
away.
Mrs.
Gardiner
about
this
time
reminded
Elizabeth
of
her
promise
concerning
that
gentleman,
and
required
information;
and
Elizabeth
had
such
to
send
as
might
rather
give
contentment
to
her
aunt
than
to
herself.
His
apparent
partiality
had
