he
had,
in
fact,
though
unconsciously,
been
attributing
many
of
his
own
feelings
and
expressions;
but
the
soothing
attentions
of
his
daughters
gradually
removed
the
present
evil,
and
the
immediate
alertness
of
one
brother,
and
better
recollections
of
the
other,
prevented
any
renewal
of
it.
There
could
hardly
be
a
happier
creature
in
the
world
than
Mrs.
John
Knightley,
in
this
short
visit
to
Hartfield,
going
about
every
morning
among
her
old
acquaintance
with
her
five
children,
and
talking
over
what
she
had
done
every
evening
with
her
father
and
sister.
She
had
nothing
to
wish
otherwise,
but
that
the
days
did
not
pass
so
swiftly.
It
was
a
delightful
visit;
perfect,
in
being
much
too
short.
In
general
their
evenings
were
less
engaged
with
friends
than
their
mornings;
but
one
complete
dinner
engagement,
and
out
of
the
house
too,
there
was
no
avoiding,
though
at
Christmas.
Mr.
Weston
would
take
no
denial;
they
must
all
dine
at
Randalls
one
day;
even
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
persuaded
to
think
it
a
possible
thing
in
preference
to
a
division
of
the
party.
How
they
were
all
to
be
conveyed,
he
would
have
made
a
difficulty
if
he
could,
but
as
his
son
