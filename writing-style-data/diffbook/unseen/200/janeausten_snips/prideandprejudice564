looking
woman!
and
her
calling
here
was
prodigiously
civil!
for
she
only
came,
I
suppose,
to
tell
us
the
Collinses
were
well.
She
is
on
her
road
somewhere,
I
dare
say,
and
so,
passing
through
Meryton,
thought
she
might
as
well
call
on
you.
I
suppose
she
had
nothing
particular
to
say
to
you,
Lizzy?"
Elizabeth
was
forced
to
give
into
a
little
falsehood
here;
for
to
acknowledge
the
substance
of
their
conversation
was
impossible.
The
discomposure
of
spirits
which
this
extraordinary
visit
threw
Elizabeth
into,
could
not
be
easily
overcome;
nor
could
she,
for
many
hours,
learn
to
think
of
it
less
than
incessantly.
Lady
Catherine,
it
appeared,
had
actually
taken
the
trouble
of
this
journey
from
Rosings,
for
the
sole
purpose
of
breaking
off
her
supposed
engagement
with
Mr.
Darcy.
It
was
a
rational
scheme,
to
be
sure!
but
from
what
the
report
of
their
engagement
could
originate,
Elizabeth
was
at
a
loss
to
imagine;
till
she
recollected
that
his
being
the
intimate
friend
of
Bingley,
and
her
being
the
sister
of
Jane,
was
enough,
at
a
time
when
the
expectation
of
one
wedding
made
everybody
eager
for
another,
to
supply
the
idea.
She
had
not
herself
forgotten
