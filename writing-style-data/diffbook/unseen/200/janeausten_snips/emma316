immediately
also,
saying,
"As
you
are
going
farther
on
business,
sir,
I
will
take
the
opportunity
of
paying
a
visit,
which
must
be
paid
some
day
or
other,
and
therefore
may
as
well
be
paid
now.
I
have
the
honour
of
being
acquainted
with
a
neighbour
of
yours,
(turning
to
Emma,)
a
lady
residing
in
or
near
Highbury;
a
family
of

name
of
Fairfax.

you
are
acquainted
with
Miss
Fairfax;
I
remember
you
knew
her
at
Weymouth,
and
a
fine
girl
she
is.
Call
upon
her,
by
all
means."
"There
is
no
necessity
for
my
calling
this
morning,"
said
the
young
man;
"another
day
would
do
as
well;
but
there
was
that
degree
of
acquaintance
at
Weymouth

to
day,

to
day.

not

be
done

be
done
too
soon.
