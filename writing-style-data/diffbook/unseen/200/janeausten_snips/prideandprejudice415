answered
with
equal
indifference
and
brevity,
and
the
other
said
no
more.
The
next
variation
which
their
visit
afforded
was
produced
by
the
entrance
of
servants
with
cold
meat,
cake,
and
a
variety
of
all
the
finest
fruits
in
season;
but
this
did
not
take
place
till
after
many
a
significant
look
and
smile
from
Mrs.
Annesley
to
Miss
Darcy
had
been
given,
to
remind
her
of
her
post.
There
was
now
employment
for
the
whole
party
for
though
they
could
not
all
talk,
they
could
all
eat;
and
the
beautiful
pyramids
of
grapes,
nectarines,
and
peaches
soon
collected
them
round
the
table.
While
thus
engaged,
Elizabeth
had
a
fair
opportunity
of
deciding
whether
she
most
feared
or
wished
for
the
appearance
of
Mr.
Darcy,
by
the
feelings
which
prevailed
on
his
entering
the
room;
and
then,
though
but
a
moment
before
she
had
believed
her
wishes
to
predominate,
she
began
to
regret
that
he
came.
He
had
been
some
time
with
Mr.
Gardiner,
who,
with
two
or
three
other
gentlemen
from
the
house,
was
engaged
by
the
river,
and
had
left
him
only
on
learning
that
the
ladies
of
the
family
intended
a
visit
to
Georgiana
that
morning.
