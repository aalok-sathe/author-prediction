leg;
it
is
very
small
and
delicate
Hartfield
pork
is
not
like
any
other
pork
but
still
it
is
pork
and,
my
dear
Emma,
unless
one
could
be
sure
of
their
making
it
into
steaks,
nicely
fried,
as
ours
are
fried,
without
the
smallest
grease,
and
not
roast
it,
for
no
stomach
can
bear
roast
pork
I
think
we
had
better
send
the
leg
do
not
you
think
so,
my
dear?"
"My
dear
papa,
I
sent
the
whole
hind
quarter.
I
knew
you
would
wish
it.
There
will
be
the
leg
to
be
salted,
you
know,
which
is
so
very
nice,
and
the
loin
to
be
dressed
directly
in
any
manner
they
like."
"That's
right,
my
dear,
very
right.
I
had
not
thought
of
it
before,
but
that
is
the
best
way.
They
must
not
over
salt
the
leg;
and
then,
if
it
is
not
over
salted,
and
if
it
is
very
thoroughly
boiled,
just
as
Serle
boils
ours,
and
eaten
very
moderately
of,
with
a
boiled
turnip,
and
a
little
carrot
or
parsnip,
I
do
not
consider
it
unwholesome."
"Emma,"
said
Mr.
Knightley
presently,
"I
have
a
piece
of

for
you.
You
