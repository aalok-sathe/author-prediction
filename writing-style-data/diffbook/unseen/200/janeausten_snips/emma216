from
having
long
understood
you,
I
have
been
in
a
most
complete
error
with
respect
to
your
views,
till
this
moment.
As
to
myself,
I
am
very
sorry
that
you
should
have
been
giving
way
to
any
feelings
Nothing
could
be
farther
from
my
wishes
your
attachment
to
my
friend
Harriet
your
pursuit
of
her,
(pursuit,
it
appeared,)
gave
me
great
pleasure,
and
I
have
been
very
earnestly
wishing
you
success:
but
had
I
supposed
that
she
were
not
your
attraction
to
Hartfield,
I
should
certainly
have
thought
you
judged
ill
in
making
your
visits
so
frequent.
Am
I
to
believe
that
you
have
never
sought
to
recommend
yourself
particularly
to
Miss
Smith?
that
you
have
never
thought
seriously
of
her?"
"Never,
madam,"
cried
he,
affronted
in
his
turn:
"never,
I
assure
you.
I
think
seriously
of
Miss
Smith!
Miss
Smith
is
a
very
good
sort
of
girl;
and
I
should
be
happy
to
see
her
respectably
settled.
I
wish
her
extremely
well:
and,
no
doubt,
there
are
men
who
might
not
object
to
Every
body
has
their
level:
but
as
for
myself,
I
am
not,
I
think,
quite
so
much
at
a
loss.
I
need
not
so
totally
despair
