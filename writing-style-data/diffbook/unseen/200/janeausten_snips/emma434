his
affection
continue,
I
must
be
on
my
guard
not
to
encourage
it.
It
would
be
most
inexcusable
to
do
otherwise,
as
my
own
mind
is
quite
made
up.
Not
that
I
imagine
he
can
think
I
have
been
encouraging
him
hitherto.
No,
if
he
had
believed
me
at
all
to
share
his
feelings,
he
would
not
have
been
so
wretched.
Could
he
have
thought
himself
encouraged,
his
looks
and
language
at
parting
would
have
been
different.
Still,
however,
I
must
be
on
my
guard.
This
is
in
the
supposition
of
his
attachment
continuing
what
it
now
is;
but
I
do
not
know
that
I
expect
it
will;
I
do
not
look
upon
him
to
be
quite
the
sort
of
man
I
do
not
altogether
build
upon
his
steadiness
or
constancy.
His
feelings
are
warm,
but
I
can
imagine
them
rather
changeable.
Every
consideration
of
the
subject,
in
short,
makes
me
thankful
that
my
happiness
is
not
more
deeply
involved.
I
shall
do
very
well
again
after
a
little
while
and
then,
it
will
be
a
good
thing
over;
for
they
say
every
body
is
in
love
once
in
their
lives,
and
I
shall
have
been
let
off
easily."
