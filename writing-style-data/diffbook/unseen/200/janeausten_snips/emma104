impossible;
she
has
refused
him,
and
so
decidedly,
I
think,
as
must
prevent
any
second
application.
She
must
abide
by
the
evil
of
having
refused
him,
whatever
it
may
be;
and
as
to
the
refusal
itself,
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
that
I
might
not
influence
her
a
little;
but
I
assure
you
there
was
very
little
for
me
or
for
any
body
to
do.
His
appearance
is
so
much
against
him,
and
his
manner
so
bad,
that
if
she
ever
were
disposed
to
favour
him,
she
is
not
now.
I
can
imagine,
that
before
she
had
seen
any
body
superior,
she
might
tolerate
him.
He
was
the
brother
of
her
friends,
and
he
took
pains
to
please
her;
and
altogether,
having
seen
nobody
better
(that
must
have
been
his
great
assistant)
she
might
not,
while
she
was
at
Abbey
Mill,
find
him
disagreeable.
But
the
case
is
altered
now.
She
knows
now
what
gentlemen
are;
and
nothing
but
a
gentleman
in
education
and
manner
has
any
chance
with
Harriet."
"Nonsense,
errant
nonsense,
as
ever
was
talked!"
cried
Mr.
Knightley.
"Robert
Martin's
manners
have
sense,
sincerity,
and
good
humour
to
recommend
them;
and
his
mind
has
more
true
gentility
