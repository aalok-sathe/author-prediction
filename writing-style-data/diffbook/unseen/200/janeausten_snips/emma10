damp
and
dirty.
I
wish
you
may
not
catch
cold."
"Dirty,
sir!
Look
at
my
shoes.
Not
a
speck
on
them."
"Well!
that
is
quite
surprising,
for
we
have
had
a
vast
deal
of
rain
here.
It
rained
dreadfully
hard
for

a
great
regard
for
you
and
Emma;
but
when
it
comes

the
question
of
dependence
or

have
only
one

please
than
two."
"Especially
when
one
of
those
two
is
such
a
fanciful,
troublesome
creature!"
said
Emma
playfully.
"That
