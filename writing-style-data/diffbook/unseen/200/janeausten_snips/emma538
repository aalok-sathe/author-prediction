she
was
working
her
way
up
from
the
bottom,
and
had
therefore
leisure
to
look
around,
and
by
only
turning
her
head
a
little
she
saw
it
all.
When
she
was
half
way
up
the
set,
the
whole
group
were
exactly
behind
her,
and
she
would
no
longer
allow
her
eyes
to
watch;
but
Mr.
Elton
was
so
near,
that
she
heard
every
syllable
of
a
dialogue
which
just
then
took
place
between
him
and
Mrs.
Weston;
and
she
perceived
that
his
wife,
who
was
standing
immediately
above
her,
was
not
only
listening
also,
but
even
encouraging
him
by
significant
glances.
The
kind
hearted,
gentle
Mrs.
Weston
had
left
her
seat
to
join
him
and
say,
"Do
not
you
dance,
Mr.
Elton?"
to
which
his
prompt
reply
was,
"Most
readily,
Mrs.
Weston,
if
you
will
dance
with
me."
"Me!
oh!
no
I
would
get
you
a
better
partner
than
myself.
I
am
no
dancer."
"If
Mrs.
Gilbert
wishes
to
dance,"
said
he,
"I
shall
have
great
pleasure,
I
am
sure
for,
though
beginning
to
feel
myself
rather
an
old
married
man,
and
that
my
dancing
days
are
over,
it
would
give
me
very
great
pleasure
at
any
time
to
stand
