for
Jane,
could
hardly
stay
even
to
be
grateful,
before
she
stept
forward
and
put
an
end
to
all
farther
singing.
Here
ceased
the
concert
part
of
the
evening,
for
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Miss
Fairfax
were
the
only
young
lady
performers;
but
soon
(within
five
minutes)
the
proposal
of
dancing
originating
nobody
exactly
knew
where
was
so
effectually
promoted
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cole,
that
every
thing
was
rapidly
clearing
away,
to
give
proper
space.
Mrs.
Weston,
capital
in
her
country
dances,
was
seated,
and
beginning
an
irresistible
waltz;
and
Frank
Churchill,
coming
up
with
most
becoming
gallantry
to
Emma,
had
secured
her
hand,
and
led
her
up
to
the
top.
While
waiting
till
the
other
young
people
could
pair
themselves
off,
Emma
found
time,
in
spite
of
the
compliments
she
was
receiving
on
her
voice
and
her
taste,
to
look
about,
and
see
what
became
of
Mr.
Knightley.
This
would
be
a
trial.
He
was
no
dancer
in
general.
If
he
were
to
be
very
alert
in
engaging
Jane
Fairfax
now,
it
might
augur
something.
There
was
no
immediate
appearance.
No;
he
was
talking
to
Mrs.
Cole
he
was
looking
on
unconcerned;
Jane
was
asked
by
somebody
else,
and
