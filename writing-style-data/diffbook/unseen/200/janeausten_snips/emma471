"Another
thing
must
be
taken
into
consideration
too
Mrs.
Elton
does
not
talk
to
Miss
Fairfax
as
she
speaks
of
her.
We
all
know
the
difference
between
the
pronouns
he
or
she
and
thou,
the
plainest
spoken
amongst
us;
we
all
feel
the
influence
of
a
something
beyond
common
civility

probably
never
fell
in
Mrs.
Elton's
way
before
and
no
degree
of
vanity
can
prevent
her
acknowledging
her
own
comparative
littleness
in
action,
if

in
consciousness."
"I
