And,
besides,
I
must
give
you
a
hint,
Frank;
any
want
of
attention
to
her
here
should
be
carefully
avoided.
You
saw
her
with
the
Campbells,
when
she
was
the
equal
of
every
body
she
mixed
with,
but
here
she
is
with
a
poor
old
grandmother,
who
has
barely
enough
to
live
on.
If
you
do
not
call
early
it
will
be
a
slight."
The
son
looked
convinced.
"I
have
heard
her
speak
of
the
acquaintance,"
said
Emma;
"she
is
a
very
elegant
young
woman."
He
agreed
to
it,
but
with
so
quiet
a
"Yes,"
as
inclined
her
almost
to
doubt
his
real
concurrence;
and
yet
there
must
be
a
very
distinct
sort
of
elegance
for
the
fashionable
world,
if
Jane
Fairfax
could
be
thought
only
ordinarily
gifted
with
it.
"If
you
were
never
particularly
struck
by
her
manners
before,"
said
she,
"I
think
you
will
to
day.
You
will
see
her
to
advantage;
see
her
and
hear
her
no,
I
am
afraid
you
will
not
hear
her
at
all,
for
she
has
an
aunt
who
never
holds
her
tongue."
"You
are
acquainted
with
Miss
Jane
Fairfax,
sir,
are
you?"
said
Mr.
Woodhouse,
always
the
last
to
make
his
way
