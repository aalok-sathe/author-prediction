am
sure!
Well,
I
am
sure
I
shall
be
extremely
glad
to
see
Mr.
Bingley.
But
good
Lord!
how
unlucky!
There
is
not
a
bit
of
fish
to
be
got
to
day.
Lydia,
my
love,
ring
the
bell
I
must
speak
to
Hill
this
moment."
"It
is
not
Mr.
Bingley,"
said
her
husband;
"it
is
a
person
whom
I
never
saw
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life."
This
roused
a
general
astonishment;
and
he
had
the
pleasure
of
being
eagerly
questioned
by
his
wife
and
his
five
daughters
at
once.
After
amusing
himself
some
time
with
their
curiosity,
he
thus
explained:
"About
a
month
ago
I
received
this
letter;
and
about
a
fortnight
ago
I
answered
it,
for
I
thought
it
a
case
of
some
delicacy,
and
requiring
early
attention.
It
is
from
my
cousin,
Mr.
Collins,
who,
when
I
am
dead,
may
turn
you
all
out
of
this
house
as
soon
as
he
pleases."
"Oh!
my
dear,"
cried
his
wife,
"I
cannot
bear
to
hear
that
mentioned.
Pray
do
not
talk
of
that
odious
man.
I
do
think
it
is
the
hardest
thing
in
the
world,
that
your
estate
should
be
entailed
away
from
your
own
children;
and
