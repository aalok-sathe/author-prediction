in
his
letter,
which
promises
well.
I
am
impatient
to
see
him."
"In
point
of
composition,"
said
Mary,
"the
letter
does
not
seem
defective.
The
idea
of
the
olive
branch
perhaps
is
not
wholly
new,
yet
I
think
it
is
well
expressed."
To
Catherine
and
Lydia,
neither
the
letter
nor
its
writer
were
in
any
degree
interesting.
It
was
next
to
impossible
that
their
cousin
should
come
in
a
scarlet
coat,
and
it
was
now
some
weeks
since
they
had
received
pleasure
from
the
society
of
a
man
in
any
other
colour.
As
for
their
mother,
Mr.
Collins's
letter
had
done
away
much
of
her
ill
will,
and
she
was
preparing
to
see
him
with
a
degree
of
composure
which
astonished
her
husband
and
daughters.
Mr.
Collins
was
punctual
to
his
time,
and
was
received
with
great
politeness
by
the
whole
family.
Mr.
Bennet
indeed
said
little;
but
the
ladies
were
ready
enough
to
talk,
and
Mr.
Collins
seemed
neither
in
need
of
encouragement,
nor
inclined
to
be
silent
himself.
He
was
a
tall,
heavy
looking
young
man
of
five
and
twenty.
His
air
was
grave
and
stately,
and
his
manners
were
very
formal.
He
had
not
been
long
seated
