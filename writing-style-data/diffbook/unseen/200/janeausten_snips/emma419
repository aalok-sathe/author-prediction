any
use."
"You
will
get
nothing
to
the
purpose
from
Miss
Bates,"
said
Emma.
"She
will
be
all
delight
and
gratitude,
but
she
will
tell
you
nothing.
She
will
not
even
listen
to
your
questions.
I
see
no
advantage
in
consulting
Miss
Bates."
"But
she
is
so
amusing,
so
extremely
amusing!
I
am
very
fond
of
hearing
Miss
Bates
talk.
And
I
need
not
bring
the
whole
family,
you
know."
Here
Mr.
Weston
joined
them,
and
on
hearing
what
was
proposed,
gave
it
his

"Aye,
do,
Frank.
Go
and
fetch
Miss

scheme,
I
am

and
I
do
not
know
a
properer
person
for
shewing
us
how
to
do
away
difficulties.
Fetch
Miss
Bates.
We
are
growing
a
little
too
nice.
She
is
a
standing
lesson
of
how
to
be
happy.
But
fetch
them
both.
Invite
them
both."
"Both
sir!
Can
the
old
lady?"...
"The
old
lady!
No,
the
young
lady,
to
be
sure.
I
shall
think
you
a
great
blockhead,
Frank,
if
you
bring
the
aunt
without
the
niece."
"Oh!
I
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
I
did
not
immediately
recollect.
Undoubtedly
if
you
wish
