might
be
hers
for
ever;
and
for
their
own
comfort
they
would
have
retained
her
wholly;
but
this
would
be
selfishness:
what
must
be
at
last,
had
better
be
soon.
Perhaps
they
began
to
feel
it
might
have
been
kinder
and
wiser
to
have
resisted
the
temptation
of
any
delay,
and
spared
her
from
a
taste
of
such
enjoyments
of
ease
and
leisure
as
must
now
be
relinquished.
Still,
however,
affection
was
glad
to
catch
at
any
reasonable
excuse
for
not
hurrying
on
the
wretched
moment.
She
had
never
been
quite
well
since
the
time
of
their
daughter's
marriage;
and
till
she
should
have
completely
recovered
her
usual
strength,
they
must
forbid
her
engaging
in
duties,
which,
so
far
from
being
compatible
with
a
weakened
frame
and
varying
spirits,
seemed,
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances,
to
require
something
more
than
human
perfection
of
body
and
mind
to
be
discharged
with
tolerable
comfort.
With
regard
to
her
not
accompanying
them
to
Ireland,
her
account
to
her
aunt
contained
nothing
but
truth,
though
there
might
be
some
truths
not
told.
It
was
her
own
choice
to
give
the
time
of
their
absence
to
Highbury;
to
spend,
perhaps,
her
last
months
of
perfect
