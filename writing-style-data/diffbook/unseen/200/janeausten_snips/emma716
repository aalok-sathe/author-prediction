effect
of
what
he
heard,
on
his
feelings.
The
delightful
assurance
of
her
total
indifference
towards
Frank
Churchill,
of
her
having
a
heart
completely
disengaged
from
him,
had
given
birth
to
the
hope,
that,
in
time,
he
might
gain
her
affection
himself;

precious
certainty
of
being
beloved,
had
cleared
from
each
the
same
degree
of
ignorance,
jealousy,
or
distrust.
On
his
side,
there
had
been
a
long
standing
jealousy,
old
