Churchills,

observed
Mr.
John
Knightley
coolly.
"But
you
need
not
imagine
Mr.
Weston
to
have
felt
what
you
would
feel
in
giving
up
Henry
or
John.
Mr.
Weston
is
rather
an
easy,
cheerful
tempered
man,
than
a
man
of
strong
feelings;
he

She

and
there
was
something
honourable
and
valuable
in
the
strong
domestic
habits,
the
all
sufficiency
of
home
to
himself,
whence
resulted
her
brother's
disposition
to
look
down
on
the
common
rate
of
social
intercourse,
and
those
to
whom
it
was
important.
It
had
a
high
claim
to
forbearance.
Mr.
Knightley
was
