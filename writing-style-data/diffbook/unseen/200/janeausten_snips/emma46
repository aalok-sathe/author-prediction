ignorant,
vulgar
woman,
certainly
I
had
better
not
visit
her,
if
I
can
help
it."
Emma
watched
her
through
the
fluctuations
of
this
speech,
and
saw
no
alarming
symptoms
of
love.
The
young
man
had
been
the
first
admirer,
but
she
trusted
there
was
no
other
hold,
and
that
there
would
be
no
serious

on
Harriet's
side,
to
oppose
any
friendly

They
met
Mr.
Martin
the
very

was
very
neat,
and
he
looked
like
a
sensible
young
man,
but
his
person
had
no
other
advantage;
and
when
he
came
to
be
contrasted
with
gentlemen,
she
thought
he
must
lose
all
the
ground
he
had
gained
in
Harriet's
inclination.
Harriet
was
not
insensible

she
had
voluntarily
noticed

Mr.
Martin
looked
