copied.
Neither
would
Mr.
Knightley's
downright,
decided,
commanding
sort
of
manner,
though
it
suits
him
very
well;
his
figure,
and
look,
and
situation
in
life
seem
to
allow
it;
but
if
any
young
man
were
to
set
about
copying
him,
he
would
not
be
sufferable.
On
the
contrary,
I
think
a
young
man
might
be
very
safely
recommended
to
take
Mr.
Elton
as
a
model.
Mr.
Elton
is
good
humoured,
cheerful,
obliging,
and
gentle.
He
seems
to
me
to

gentle
of
late.
I

used
to
be.
If
he
means
any
thing,
it
must
be
to
please
you.
Did
not
I
tell
you
what
he
said
of
you
the
other
day?"
She
then
repeated
some
warm
personal
praise
which
she
had
drawn
from
Mr.
Elton,
and
now
did
full
justice
to;
and
Harriet
blushed
and
smiled,
and
said
she
had
always
thought
Mr.
Elton
very
agreeable.
Mr.
Elton
was
the
very
person
fixed
on
by
Emma
for
driving
the
young
farmer
out
of
Harriet's
head.
She
thought
