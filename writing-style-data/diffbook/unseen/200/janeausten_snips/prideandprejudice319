be
the
grossest
falsehood!"
and
when
she
had
gone
through
the
whole
letter,
though
scarcely
knowing
anything
of
the
last
page
or
two,
put
it
hastily
away,
protesting
that
she
would
not
regard
it,
that
she
would
never
look
in
it
again.
In
this
perturbed
state
of
mind,
with
thoughts
that
could
rest
on
nothing,
she
walked
on;
but
it
would
not
do;
in
half
a
minute
the
letter
was
unfolded
again,
and
collecting
herself
as
well
as
she
could,
she
again
began
the
mortifying
perusal
of
all
that
related
to
Wickham,
and
commanded
herself
so
far
as
to
examine
the
meaning
of
every
sentence.
The
account
of
his
connection
with
the
Pemberley
family
was
exactly
what
he
had
related
himself;
and
the
kindness
of
the
late
Mr.
Darcy,
though
she
had
not
before
known
its
extent,
agreed
equally
well
with
his
own
words.
So
far
each
recital
confirmed
the
other;
but
when
she
came
to
the
will,
the
difference
was
great.
What
Wickham
had
said
of
the
living
was
fresh
in
her
memory,
and
as
she
recalled
his
very
words,
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
that
there
was
gross
duplicity
on
one
side
or
the
other;
and,
for
