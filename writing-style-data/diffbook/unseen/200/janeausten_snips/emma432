Jane
could
have
attended
it;
and
it
was
charity
to
impute
some
of
her
unbecoming
indifference
to
the
languor
of
ill
health.
Emma
continued
to
entertain
no
doubt
of
her
being
in
love.
Her
ideas
only
varied
as
to
the
how
much.
At
first,
she
thought
it
was
a
good
deal;
and
afterwards,
but
little.
She
had
great
pleasure
in
hearing
Frank
Churchill
talked
of;
and,
for
his
sake,
greater
pleasure
than
ever
in
seeing
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston;
she
was
very
often
thinking
of
him,
and
quite
impatient
for
a
letter,
that
she
might
know
how
he
was,
how
were
his
spirits,
how
was
his
aunt,
and
what
was
the
chance
of
his
coming
to
Randalls
again
this
spring.
But,
on
the
other
hand,
she
could
not
admit
herself
to
be
unhappy,
nor,
after
the
first
morning,
to
be
less
disposed
for
employment
than
usual;
she
was
still
busy
and
cheerful;
and,
pleasing
as
he
was,
she
could
yet
imagine
him
to
have
faults;
and
farther,
though
thinking
of
him
so
much,
and,
as
she
sat
drawing
or
working,
forming
a
thousand
amusing
schemes
for
the
progress
and
close
of
their
attachment,
fancying
interesting
dialogues,
and
inventing
elegant
letters;
