you
please.
My
dear
Isabella,
I
have
not
heard
you
make
one
inquiry
about
Mr.
Perry
yet;
and
he
never
forgets
you."
"Oh!
good
Mr.
Perry
how
is
he,
sir?"
"Why,
pretty
well;
but
not
quite
well.
Poor
Perry
is
bilious,
and
he
has
not
time
to
take
care
of
himself
he
tells
me
he
has
not
time
to
take
care

himself
which

but
he
is
always

anywhere.
But
then
there
is
not
so

"And

I

Mr.
Perry.
I
hope
he
will
be
calling
soon.
He
will
be
so
pleased
to
see
my
little
ones."
"I
hope
he
will
be
here
to
morrow,
for
I
have
a
question
or
two
to
ask
him
about
myself
of
some
consequence.
And,
my
dear,
whenever
he
comes,
you
had
better
let
him
look
at
little
Bella's
throat."
"Oh!
my
dear
sir,
her
throat
is
so
much
better
that
I
have
hardly
any
uneasiness
about
it.
Either
bathing
has
been
of
the
greatest
