Colonel
Forster's.
Kitty
and
me
were
to
spend
the
day
there,
and
Mrs.
Forster
promised
to
have
a
little
dance
in
the
evening;
(by
the
bye,
Mrs.
Forster
and
me
are
such
friends!)
and
so
she
asked
the
two
Harringtons
to
come,
but
Harriet
was
ill,
and
so
Pen
was
forced
to
come
by
herself;
and
then,
what
do
you
think
we
did?
We
dressed
up
Chamberlayne
in
woman's
clothes
on
purpose
to
pass
for
a
lady,
only
think
what
fun!
Not
a
soul
knew
of
it,
but
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Forster,
and
Kitty
and
me,
except
my
aunt,
for
we
were
forced
to
borrow
one
of
her
gowns;
and
you
cannot
imagine
how
well
he
looked!
When
Denny,
and
Wickham,
and
Pratt,
and
two
or
three
more
of
the
men
came
in,
they
did
not
know
him
in
the
least.
Lord!
how
I
laughed!
and
so
did
Mrs.
Forster.
I
thought
I
should
have
died.
And
that
made
the
men
suspect
something,
and
then
they
soon
found
out
what
was
the
matter."
With
such
kinds
of
histories
of
their
parties
and
good
jokes,
did
Lydia,
assisted
by
Kitty's
hints
and
additions,
endeavour
to
amuse
her
companions
all
the
way
