to
Box
Hill.
That
there
was
to
be
such
a
party
had
been
long
generally
known:
it
had
even
given
the
idea
of
another.
Emma
had
never
been
to
Box
Hill;
she
wished
to
see
what
every
body
found
so
well
worth
seeing,
and
she
and
Mr.
Weston
had
agreed
to
chuse
some
fine
morning
and
drive
thither.
Two
or
three
more
of
the
chosen
only
were
to
be
admitted
to
join
them,
and
it
was
to
be
done
in
a
quiet,
unpretending,
elegant
way,
infinitely
superior
to
the
bustle
and
preparation,
the
regular
eating
and
drinking,
and
picnic
parade
of
the
Eltons
and
the
Sucklings.
This
was
so
very
well
understood
between
them,
that
Emma
could
not
but
feel
some
surprise,
and
a
little
displeasure,
on
hearing
from
Mr.
Weston
that
he
had
been
proposing
to
Mrs.
Elton,
as
her
brother
and
sister
had
failed
her,
that
the
two
parties
should
unite,
and
go
together;
and
that
as
Mrs.
Elton
had
very
readily
acceded
to
it,
so
it
was
to
be,
if
she
had
no
objection.
Now,
as
her
objection
was
nothing
but
her
very
great
dislike
of
Mrs.
Elton,
of
which
Mr.
Weston
must
already
be
perfectly
aware,
