In
one
respect
he
is
the
object
of
my
envy."
Emma
could
say
no
more.
They
seemed
to
be
within
half
a
sentence
of
Harriet,
and
her
immediate
feeling
was
to
avert
the
subject,
if
possible.
She
made
her
plan;
she
would
speak
of
something
totally
different
the
children
in
Brunswick
Square;
and
she
only
waited
for
breath
to
begin,
when
Mr.
Knightley
startled
her,
by
saying,
"You
will
not
ask
me
what
is
the
point
of
envy.
You
are
determined,
I
see,
to
have
no
curiosity.
You
are
wise
but
I
cannot
be
wise.
Emma,
I
must
tell
you
what
you
will
not
ask,
though
I
may
wish
it
unsaid
the
next
moment."
"Oh!
then,
don't
speak
it,
don't
speak
it,"
she
eagerly
cried.
"Take
a
little
time,
consider,
do
not
commit
yourself."
"Thank
you,"
said
he,
in
an
accent
of
deep
mortification,
and
not
another
syllable
followed.
Emma
could
not
bear
to
give
him
pain.
He
was
wishing
to
confide
in
her
perhaps
to
consult
her;
cost
her
what
it
would,
she
would
listen.
She
might
assist
his
resolution,
or
reconcile
him
to
it;
she
might
give
just
praise
to
Harriet,
or,
by
representing
to
him
his
own
