Jane
now
came
up.
"Read
it
aloud,"
said
their
father,
"for
I
hardly
know
myself
what
it
is
about."
"Gracechurch
Street,
Monday,
August
2.
"MY
DEAR
BROTHER,
"At
last
I
am
able
to
send
you
some
tidings
of
my
niece,
and
such
as,
upon
the

I
hope

will
give

satisfaction.
Soon

engagements
which
I
have
ventured
to
make
on
your
side,
I
hope
it
will
not
be
long
before
they
are.
All
that
is
required
of
you
is,
to
assure
to
your
daughter,
by
settlement,
her
equal
share
of
the
five
thousand
pounds
secured
among
your
children

the
decease
of
yourself
and
my
sister;
