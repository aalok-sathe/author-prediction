no

The
gipsies
did
not
wait
for
the
operations
of
justice;
they
took
themselves
off
in
a
hurry.
The
young
ladies
of
Highbury
might
have
walked
again
in
safety
before
their
panic
began,
and
the
whole
history
dwindled
soon
into
a
matter
of
little
importance
but
to
Emma
and
her
nephews:
in
her
imagination
it
maintained
its
ground,
and
Henry

of
confession
to
make
and
then,
you
know,
it
will
be
over."
Emma
was
a
good
deal
surprized;
but
begged
her
to
speak.
There
was
a
seriousness
in
Harriet's
manner
which
prepared
her,
quite
as
much
as
her
words,
for
something
more
than
ordinary.
"It
is
my
duty,
