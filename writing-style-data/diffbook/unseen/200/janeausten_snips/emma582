it
was
not
worth
bringing
forward
again:
it
could
not
be
done
without
a
reproof
to
him,
which
would
be
giving
pain
to
his
wife;
and
she
found
herself
therefore
obliged
to
consent
to
an
arrangement
which
she
would
have
done
a
great
deal
to
avoid;
an
arrangement
which
would
probably
expose
her
even
to
the
degradation
of
being
said
to
be
of
Mrs.
Elton's
party!
Every
feeling
was
offended;
and
the
forbearance
of
her

own
amusement.
And
she
is
a
good
natured
woman
after
all.
One
could
not
leave
her
out."
Emma
denied
none
of
it
aloud,
and
agreed
to
none
of
it
in
private.
It
was
now
the
middle
of
June,
and
the
weather
fine;
and
Mrs.
Elton
was
growing
impatient
to
name
the
