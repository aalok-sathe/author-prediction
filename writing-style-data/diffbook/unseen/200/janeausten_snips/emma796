might
have
been
some
amusement
to
myself
in
the
same
situation.
I
think
there
is
a
little
likeness
between
us."
He
bowed.
"If
not
in
our
dispositions,"
she
presently
added,
with
a
look
of
true
sensibility,
"there
is
a
likeness
in
our
destiny;
the
destiny
which
bids
fair
to
connect
us
with
two
characters
so

to
our
own."
"True,

my
aunt's
jewels.
They
are
to
be
new
set.
I
am
resolved
to
have
some
in
an
ornament
for
the
head.
Will
not
it
be
beautiful
in
her
dark
hair?"
"Very
beautiful,
indeed,"
replied
Emma;
and
she
spoke
so
kindly,
that
he
gratefully
burst
out,
"How
delighted
I
am
to
see
you
again!
and
to
see
you
in
such
excellent
looks!
I
would
not
