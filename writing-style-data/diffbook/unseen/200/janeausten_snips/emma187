myself
that
she
must
be
better
after
such
a
cordial
as
I
knew
had
been
given
her
in
the
morning."
Emma
smiled
and
answered
"My
visit
was
of
use
to
the
nervous
part
of
her
complaint,
I
hope;
but
not
even
I
can
charm
away
a
sore
throat;
it
is
a
most
severe
cold
indeed.
Mr.
Perry
has
been
with
her,
as
you
probably
heard."
"Yes
I
imagined
that
is
I
did
not
"
"He

and
I
hope
to

will

accompanied
it
was
really
estimable;
but
it
should
have
lasted
longer.
Emma
was
rather
in
dismay
when
only
half
a
minute
afterwards
he
began
to
speak
of
other
things,
and
in
a
voice
of
the
greatest
alacrity
and
enjoyment.
"What
an
excellent
device,"
said
he,
"the
use
of
a
sheepskin
for
carriages.
How
very
comfortable
they
make
it;
impossible
to
feel
cold
with
such
precautions.
