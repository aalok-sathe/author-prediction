but
I
do
not
think
him
so
plain
now.
One
does
not,
you
know,
after
a
time.
But
did
you
never
see
him?
He
is
in
Highbury
every
now
and
then,
and
he
is
sure
to
ride
through
every
week
in
his
way
to
Kingston.
He
has
passed
you
very
often."
"That
may
be,
and
I
may
have
seen
him
fifty
times,
but
without
having
any
idea
of
his
name.
A
young
farmer,
whether
on
horseback
or
on
foot,
is
the
very
last
sort
of
person
to
raise
my
curiosity.
The
yeomanry
are
precisely
the
order
of
people
with
whom
I
feel
I
can
have
nothing
to
do.
A
degree
or
two
lower,
and
a
creditable
appearance
might
interest
me;
I
might
hope
to
be
useful
to
their
families
in
some
way
or
other.
But
a
farmer
can
need
none
of
my
help,
and
is,
therefore,
in
one
sense,
as
much
above
my
notice
as
in
every
other
he
is
below
it."
"To
be
sure.
Oh
yes!
It
is
not
likely
you
should
ever
have
observed
him;
but
he
knows
you
very
well
indeed
I
mean
by
sight."
"I
have
no
doubt
of
his
being
a
very
respectable
young
man.
