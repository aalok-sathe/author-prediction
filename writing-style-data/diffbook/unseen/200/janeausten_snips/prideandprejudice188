incapable
of
wilfully
deceiving
anyone;
and
all
that
I
can
hope
in
this
case
is
that
she
is
deceiving
herself."
"That
is
right.
You
could
not
have
started
a
more
happy
idea,
since
you
will
not
take
comfort
in
mine.
Believe
her
to
be
deceived,
by
all
means.
You
have
now
done
your
duty
by
her,
and
must
fret
no
longer."
"But,
my
dear
sister,
can
I
be
happy,
even
supposing
the
best,
in
accepting
a
man
whose
sisters
and
friends
are
all
wishing
him
to
marry
elsewhere?"
"You
must
decide
for
yourself,"
said
Elizabeth;
"and
if,
upon
mature
deliberation,
you
find
that
the
misery
of
disobliging
his
two
sisters
is
more
than
equivalent
to
the
happiness
of
being
his
wife,
I
advise
you
by
all
means
to
refuse
him."
"How
can
you
talk
so?"
said
Jane,
faintly
smiling.
"You
must
know
that
though
I
should
be
exceedingly
grieved
at
their
disapprobation,
I
could
not
hesitate."
"I
did
not
think
you
would;
and
that
being
the
case,
I
cannot
consider
your
situation
with
much
compassion."
"But
if
he
returns
no
more
this
winter,
my
choice
will
never
be
required.
A
thousand
things
may
arise
in
six
months!"
