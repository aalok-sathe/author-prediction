was
she
to
bear
the
change?
It
was
true
that
her
friend
was
going
only
half
a
mile
from
them;
but
Emma
was
aware
that
great
must
be
the
difference
between
a
Mrs.
Weston,
only
half
a
mile
from
them,
and
a
Miss
Taylor
in
the
house;
and
with
all
her
advantages,
natural
and
domestic,
she
was
now
in
great
danger
of
suffering
from
intellectual
solitude.
She
dearly
loved
her
father,
but
he
was
no
companion
for
her.
He
could
not
meet
her
in
conversation,
rational
or
playful.
The
evil
of
the
actual
disparity
in
their
ages
(and
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
not
married
early)
was
much
increased
by
his
constitution
and
habits;
for
having
been
a
valetudinarian
all
his
life,
without
activity
of
mind
or
body,
he
was
a
much
older
man
in
ways
than
in
years;
and
though
everywhere
beloved
for
the
friendliness
of
his
heart
and
his
amiable
temper,
his
talents
could
not
have
recommended
him
at
any
time.
Her
sister,
though
comparatively
but
little
removed
by
matrimony,
being
settled
in
London,
only
sixteen
miles
off,
was
much
beyond
her
daily
reach;
and
many
a
long
October
and
November
evening
must
be
struggled
through
at
Hartfield,
before
Christmas
