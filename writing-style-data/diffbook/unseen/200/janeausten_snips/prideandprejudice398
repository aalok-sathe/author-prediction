him
walking
slowly
towards
the
house.
The
observations
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
now
began;
and
each
of
them
pronounced
him
to
be
infinitely
superior
to
anything
they
had
expected.
"He
is
perfectly
well
behaved,
polite,
and
unassuming,"
said
her
uncle.
"There
is
something
a
little
stately
in
him,

replied
her
aunt,
"but
it

his
features
are
perfectly

But
how
came
you
to
tell
me
that
he
was
so
disagreeable?"
Elizabeth
excused
herself
as
well
as
she
could;
said
that
she
had
liked
him
better
when
they
had
met

and
that
she
had
never
seen
him
