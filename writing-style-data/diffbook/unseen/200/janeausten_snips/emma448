not

the
house
the
grounds,
I
assure
you,
as
far
as
I
could
observe,
are
strikingly
like.
The
laurels
at
Maple
Grove
are
in
the
same
profusion
as
here,
and
stand
very
much
in
the
same
way
just
across
the
lawn;
and
I
had
a
glimpse
of
a
fine
large
tree,
with
a
bench
round
it,
which
put
me
so
exactly
in

My

and
therefore
only
said
in
reply,
"When

country,
I
am
afraid

Hartfield.
Surry

"Oh!
yes,
I
am
quite

Surry

"Yes;
but
