and
it
was
hardly
less
inevitable
that
poor
little
Harriet
must
be
asked
to
make
the
eighth:
but
this
invitation
was
not
given
with
equal
satisfaction,
and
on
many
accounts
Emma
was
particularly
pleased
by
Harriet's
begging
to
be
allowed
to
decline
it.
"She
would
rather
not
be
in
his
company
more

she
really
wanted
to
make
the
eighth,
Jane
Fairfax.
Since
her
last
conversation
with
Mrs.
Weston
and
Mr.
Knightley,
she
was
more
conscience
stricken
about
Jane
Fairfax
than
she
had
often
been.
Mr.
Knightley's
words
dwelt
with
her.
He
had
said
that
Jane
Fairfax
received
attentions
from
Mrs.
Elton
which
nobody
else
paid
her.
"This
is
very
true,"
said
she,
