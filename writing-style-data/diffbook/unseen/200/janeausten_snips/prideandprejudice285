very
well,"
replied
Colonel
Fitzwilliam.
"But
so
we
all
do.
It
is
only
that
he
has
better
means
of
having
it
than
many
others,
because
he
is
rich,
and
many
others
are
poor.
I
speak
feelingly.
A
younger
son,
you
know,
must
be
inured
to
self
denial
and
dependence."
"In
my
opinion,
the
younger
son

an
earl
can
know
very
little
of
either.

what

do."
"Our
