more

to
give
them
the
honour
of
his
company."
Upon
the
whole,
she
was
very
persuadable;
and
it
being
briefly
settled
among
themselves
how
it
might
be
done
without
neglecting
his
comfort
how
certainly
Mrs.
Goddard,
if
not
Mrs.
Bates,
might
be
depended

company
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
to
be
talked
into
an
acquiescence
of
his
daughter's
going
out
to
dinner
on
a
day
now
near

never

I
am
sorry
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cole
should
have
done
it.
I
think
it
would
be
much
better
if
they
would
come
in
one
afternoon
next
summer,
and
take
their
tea
with
us
take
us
in
their
afternoon
walk;
which
they
might
do,
as
our
hours
are
so
reasonable,
and
yet
get
home
without
being
out
in
the
damp
of
the
evening.
