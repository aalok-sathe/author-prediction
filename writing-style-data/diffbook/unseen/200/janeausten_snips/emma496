would
take
up
with
any
thing;
but
I
shall
be
a
little
more
nice,
and
I
am
sure
the
good
Campbells
will
be
quite
on
my
side;
with
your
superior
talents,
you
have
a
right
to
move
in
the
first
circle.
Your
musical
knowledge
alone
would
entitle
you
to
name
your
own
terms,
have
as
many
rooms
as
you
like,
and
mix
in
the
family
as
much
as
you
chose;
that
is
I
do
not
know
if
you
knew
the
harp,
you
might
do
all
that,
I
am
very
sure;
but
you
sing
as
well
as
play;
yes,
I
really
believe
you
might,
even
without
the
harp,
stipulate
for
what
you
chose;
and
you
must
and
shall
be
delightfully,
honourably
and
comfortably
settled
before
the
Campbells
or
I
have
any
rest."
"You
may
well
class
the
delight,
the
honour,
and
the
comfort
of
such
a
situation
together,"
said
Jane,
"they
are
pretty
sure
to
be
equal;
however,
I
am
very
serious
in
not
wishing
any
thing
to
be
attempted
at
present
for
me.
I
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
you,
Mrs.
Elton,
I
am
obliged
to
any
body
who
feels
for
me,
but
I
am
quite
serious
in
wishing
nothing
