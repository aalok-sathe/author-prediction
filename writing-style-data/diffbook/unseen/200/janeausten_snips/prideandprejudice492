there.
Wickham
was
not
at
all
more
distressed
than
herself,
but
his
manners
were
always
so
pleasing,
that
had
his
character
and
his
marriage
been
exactly
what
they
ought,
his
smiles
and
his
easy
address,
while
he
claimed

which
she
felt
very
unable
to
equal
in
her
replies.
They

have
the
happiest
memories
in
the
world.
Nothing
of
the
past
was
recollected
with
