paused
and
growing
cooler
in
a
moment,
added,
with
only
sarcastic
dryness,
"If
Mr.
Perry
can
tell
me
how
to
convey
a
wife
and
five
children
a
distance
of
an
hundred
and
thirty
miles
with
no
greater
expense
or
inconvenience
than
a
distance
of
forty,
I
should
be
as
willing
to
prefer
Cromer
to
South
End
as
he
could
himself."
"True,
true,"
cried
Mr.
Knightley,
with
most
ready
interposition
"very
true.
That's
a
consideration
indeed.
But
John,
as
to
what
I
was
telling
you
of
my
idea
of
moving
the
path
to
Langham,
of
turning
it
more
to
the
right
that
it
may
not
cut
through
the
home
meadows,
I
cannot
conceive
any
difficulty.
I
should
not
attempt
it,
if
it
were
to
be
the
means
of
inconvenience
to
the
Highbury
people,
but
if
you
call
to
mind
exactly
the
present
line
of
the
path....
The
only
way
of
proving
it,
however,
will
be
to
turn
to
our
maps.
I
shall
see
you
at
the
Abbey
to
morrow
morning
I
hope,
and
then
we
will
look
them
over,
and
you
shall
give
me
your
opinion."
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
rather
agitated
by
such
harsh
reflections
on
his
friend
Perry,
to
whom
