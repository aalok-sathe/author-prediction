company.
What
shall
we
do
with
him?
Lizzy,
you
must
walk
out
with
him
again,
that
he
may
not
be
in
Bingley's
way."
Elizabeth
could
hardly
help
laughing
at
so
convenient
a
proposal;
yet
was
really
vexed
that
her
mother
should
be
always
giving
him
such
an
epithet.
As
soon
as
they
entered,
Bingley
looked
at
her
so
expressively,
and
shook
hands
with
such
warmth,
as
left
no

it
will
be
too
much

Kitty.
Won't
it,
Kitty?"
Kitty
owned
that
she
had
rather
stay
at
home.
Darcy
professed
a
great
curiosity
to
see
the
view
from
the
Mount,
and
Elizabeth
silently
consented.
As
she
went
up

to
get

Mrs.
Bennet

her,
saying:
"I
am
