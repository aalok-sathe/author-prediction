others
the
most
afflicting
to
a
parent's
mind.
The
death
of
your
daughter
would
have
been
a
blessing
in
comparison
of
this.
And
it
is
the
more
to
be
lamented,
because
there
is
reason
to
suppose
as
my
dear
Charlotte
informs
me,
that
this
licentiousness
of
behaviour
in
your
daughter
has
proceeded
from
a
faulty
degree
of
indulgence;
though,
at
the
same
time,
for
the
consolation
of
yourself
and
Mrs.
Bennet,
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
her
own
disposition
must
be
naturally
bad,
or
she
could
not
be
guilty
of
such
an
enormity,
at
so
early
an
age.
Howsoever
that
may
be,
you
are
grievously
to
be
pitied;
in
which
opinion
I
am
not
only
joined
by
Mrs.
Collins,
but
likewise
by
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter,
to
whom
I
have
related
the
affair.
They
agree
with
me
in
apprehending
that
this
false
step
in
one
daughter
will
be
injurious
to
the
fortunes
of
all
the
others;
for
who,
as
Lady
Catherine
herself
condescendingly
says,
will
connect
themselves
with
such
a
family?
And
this
consideration
leads
me
moreover
to
reflect,
with
augmented
satisfaction,
on
a
certain
event
of
last
November;

had
it
been
otherwise,
