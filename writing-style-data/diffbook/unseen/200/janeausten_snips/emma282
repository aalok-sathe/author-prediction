be
married
to
a
Miss
Hawkins.
By
his
style,
I
should
imagine
it
just
settled."
"Mr.
Elton
going
to
be
married!"
said
Emma,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak.
"He
will
have
every
body's
wishes
for
his
happiness."
"He
is
very
young
to
settle,"
was
Mr.
Woodhouse's
observation.
"He
had
better
not
be
in
a
hurry.
He
seemed
to
me
very
well
off
as
he
was.
We
were
always
glad
to
see
him
at
Hartfield."
"A
new
neighbour
for
us
all,
Miss
Woodhouse!"
said
Miss
Bates,
joyfully;
"my
mother
is
so
pleased!
she
says
she
cannot
bear
to
have
the
poor
old
Vicarage
without
a
mistress.
This
is
great
news,
indeed.
Jane,
you
have
never
seen
Mr.
Elton!
no
wonder
that
you
have
such
a
curiosity
to
see
him."
Jane's
curiosity
did
not
appear
of
that
absorbing
nature
as
wholly
to
occupy
her.
"No
I
have
never
seen
Mr.
Elton,"
she
replied,
starting
on
this
appeal;
"is
he
is
he
a
tall
man?"
"Who
shall
answer
that
question?"
cried
Emma.
"My
father
would
say
'yes,'
Mr.
Knightley
'no;'
and
Miss
Bates
and
I
that
he
is
just
the
happy
medium.
When
you
have
been
here
a
little
longer,
Miss
Fairfax,
