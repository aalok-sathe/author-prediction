was
given
up
to
the
care
and
the
wealth
of
the
Churchills,
and
he
had
only
his
own
comfort
to
seek,
and
his
own
situation
to
improve
as
he
could.
A
complete
change
of
life
became
desirable.
He
quitted
the
militia
and
engaged
in
trade,
having
brothers
already
established
in
a
good
way
in
London,
which
afforded
him
a
favourable
opening.
It

brought
just
employment

easy
competence

to
secure
the
purchase
of
a

which
he
had
always
longed
for
enough
to
marry
a
woman
as
portionless
even
as
Miss
Taylor,
and
to
live
according
to
the
wishes
of
his
own
friendly
and
social
disposition.
It
was
now
some
time
since
Miss
Taylor
had
begun
to
influence
his
schemes;
but
as
it
was
not
the
tyrannic
influence
of
youth
on
youth,
it
had
not
shaken
his
determination
of
never
settling
till
he
could
