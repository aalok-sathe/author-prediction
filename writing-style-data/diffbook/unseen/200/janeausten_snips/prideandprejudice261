cousin
to
give
her
opinion
of
all
that
she
had
seen
at
Rosings,
which,
for
Charlotte's
sake,
she
made
more
favourable
than
it
really
was.
But
her
commendation,
though
costing
her
some
trouble,
could
by
no
means
satisfy
Mr.
Collins,
and
he
was
very
soon
obliged
to
take
her
ladyship's
praise
into
his
own
hands.
Sir
William
stayed
only
a
week
at
Hunsford,
but
his
visit
was
long
enough
to
convince
him
of
his
daughter's
being
most
comfortably
settled,
and
of
her
possessing
such
a
husband
and
such
a
neighbour
as
were
not
often
met
with.
While
Sir
William
was
with
them,
Mr.
Collins
devoted
his
morning
to
driving
him
out
in
his
gig,
and
showing
him
the
country;
but
when
he
went
away,
the
whole
family
returned
to
their
usual
employments,
and
Elizabeth
was
thankful
to
find
that
they
did
not
see
more
of
her
cousin
by
the
alteration,
for
the
chief
of
the
time
between
breakfast
and
dinner
was
now
passed
by
him
either
at
work
in
the
garden
or
in
reading
and
writing,
and
looking
out
of
the
window
in
his
own
book
room,
which
fronted
the
road.
The
room
in
which
the
ladies
sat
was
backwards.
