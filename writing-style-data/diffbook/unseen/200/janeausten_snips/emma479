"at
least
as
far
as
relates
to
me,
which
was
all
that
was
meant
and
it
is
very
shameful.
Of
the
same
age
and
always
knowing
her
I
ought
to
have
been
more
her
friend.
She
will
never
like
me
now.
I
have
neglected
her
too
long.
But
I
will
shew
her
greater
attention
than
I
have
done."
Every
invitation
was
successful.
They
were
all
disengaged
and
all
happy.
The
preparatory
interest
of
this
dinner,
however,
was
not
yet
over.
A
circumstance
rather
unlucky
occurred.
The
two
eldest
little
Knightleys
were
engaged
to
pay
their
grandpapa
and
aunt
a
visit
of
some
weeks
in
the
spring,
and
their
papa
now
proposed
bringing
them,
and
staying
one
whole
day
at
Hartfield
which
one
day
would
be
the
very
day
of
this
party.
His
professional
engagements
did
not
allow
of
his
being
put
off,
but
both
father
and
daughter
were
disturbed
by
its
happening
so.
Mr.
Woodhouse
considered
eight
persons
at
dinner
together
as
the
utmost
that
his
nerves
could
bear
and
here
would
be
a
ninth
and
Emma
apprehended
that
it
would
be
a
ninth
very
much
out
of
humour
at
not
being
able
to
come
even
to
Hartfield
for
forty
