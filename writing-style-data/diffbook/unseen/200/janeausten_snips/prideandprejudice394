and
so
far
from
going
away,
turned
back
with
them,
and
entered
into
conversation
with
Mr.
Gardiner.
Elizabeth
could
not
but
be
pleased,
could
not
but
triumph.
It
was
consoling
that
he
should
know
she
had
some
relations
for
whom
there
was
no
need
to
blush.
She
listened
most
attentively
to
all
that
passed
between
them,
and
gloried
in
every
expression,
every
sentence
of
her
uncle,
which
marked
his
intelligence,
his
taste,
or
his
good
manners.
The
conversation
soon
turned
upon
fishing;
and
she
heard
Mr.
Darcy
invite
him,
with
the
greatest
civility,
to
fish
there
as
often
as
he
chose
while
he
continued
in
the
neighbourhood,
offering
at
the
same
time
to
supply
him
with
fishing
tackle,
and
pointing
out
those
parts
of
the
stream
where
there
was
usually
most
sport.
Mrs.
Gardiner,
who
was
walking
arm
in
arm
with
Elizabeth,
gave
her
a
look
expressive
of
wonder.
Elizabeth
said
nothing,
but
it
gratified
her
exceedingly;
the
compliment
must
be
all
for
herself.
Her
astonishment,
however,
was
extreme,
and
continually
was
she
repeating,
"Why
is
he
so
altered?
From
what
can
it
proceed?
It
cannot
be
for
me
it
cannot
be
for
my
sake
that
his
manners
are
thus
