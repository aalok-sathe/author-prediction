Woodhouse,"
said
the
latter,
"I
am
just
run
across
to
entreat
the
favour
of
you
to
come
and
sit
down
with
us
a
little
while,
and
give
us
your
opinion
of
our
new
instrument;
you
and
Miss
Smith.
How
do
you
do,
Miss
Smith?
Very
well
I
thank
you.
And
I
begged
Mrs.
Weston
to
come
with
me,
that
I
might
be
sure
of
succeeding."
"I
hope
Mrs.
Bates
and
Miss
Fairfax
are
"
"Very
well,
I
am
much
obliged
to
you.
My
mother
is
delightfully
well;
and
Jane
caught
no
cold
last
night.
How
is
Mr.
Woodhouse?
I
am
so
glad
to
hear
such
a
good
account.
Mrs.
Weston
told
me
you
were
here.
Oh!
then,
said
I,
I
must
run
across,
I
am
sure
Miss
Woodhouse
will
allow
me
just
to
run
across
and
entreat
her
to
come
in;
my
mother
will
be
so
very
happy
to
see
her
and
now
we
are
such
a
nice
party,
she
cannot
refuse.
'Aye,
pray
do,'
said
Mr.
Frank
Churchill,
'Miss
Woodhouse's
opinion
of
the
instrument
will
be
worth
having.'
But,
said
I,
I
shall
be
more
sure
of
succeeding
if
one
of
you
will
go
with
me.
'Oh,'
said
he,
