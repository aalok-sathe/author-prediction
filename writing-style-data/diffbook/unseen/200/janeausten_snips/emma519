and
laugh
as
ever,
and
seemed
delighted
to
speak
of
his
former
visit,
and
recur
to
old
stories:
and
he
was
not
without
agitation.
It
was
not
in
his
calmness
that
she
read
his
comparative
difference.
He
was
not
calm;
his
spirits
were
evidently
fluttered;
there
was
restlessness
about
him.
Lively
as
he
was,
it
seemed
a
liveliness
that
did
not
satisfy
himself;
but
what
decided
her
belief
on
the

was
his
staying
only
a

he
wished
to
stay
longer
at
Hartfield,
he
must
hurry
off."
She
had
no
doubt
as
to
his
being
less
in
love
but
neither
his
agitated
spirits,
nor
his
hurrying
away,
seemed
like
a
perfect
cure;
and
she
was
rather
inclined
to
think
it
implied
a
dread
of
her
returning
power,
and
a
discreet
resolution
of
not
trusting
himself
