but
as
for
the
ball,
it
is
quite
a
settled
thing;
and
as
soon
as
Nicholls
has
made
white
soup
enough,
I
shall
send
round
my
cards."
"I
should
like
balls
infinitely
better,"
she
replied,
"if
they
were
carried
on
in
a
different
manner;
but
there
is
something
insufferably
tedious
in
the
usual
process
of
such
a
meeting.
It
would
surely
be
much
more
rational
if
conversation
instead
of
dancing
were
made
the
order
of
the
day."
"Much
more
rational,
my
dear
Caroline,
I
dare
say,
but
it
would
not
be
near
so
much
like
a
ball."
Miss
Bingley
made
no
answer,
and
soon
afterwards
she
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room.
Her
figure
was
elegant,
and
she
walked
well;
but
Darcy,
at
whom
it
was
all
aimed,
was
still
inflexibly
studious.
In
the
desperation
of
her
feelings,
she
resolved
on
one
effort
more,
and,
turning
to
Elizabeth,
said:
"Miss
Eliza
Bennet,
let
me
persuade
you
to
follow
my
example,
and
take
a
turn
about
the
room.
I
assure
you
it
is
very
refreshing
after
sitting
so
long
in
one
attitude."
Elizabeth
was
surprised,
but
agreed
to
it
immediately.
Miss
Bingley
succeeded
no
less
in
the
real
object
of
