than
run
the
risk
of
offending
your
patroness."
"My
dear
sir,"
replied
Mr.
Collins,
"I
am
particularly
obliged
to
you
for
this
friendly
caution,
and
you
may
depend
upon
my
not
taking
so
material
a
step
without
her
ladyship's
concurrence."
"You
cannot
be
too
much
upon
your
guard.
Risk
anything
rather
than
her
displeasure;
and
if
you
find
it
likely
to
be
raised
by
your
coming
to
us
again,
which
I
should
think
exceedingly
probable,
stay
quietly
at
home,
and
be
satisfied
that
we
shall
take
no
offence."
"Believe
me,
my
dear
sir,
my
gratitude
is
warmly
excited
by
such
affectionate
attention;
and
depend
upon
it,
you
will
speedily
receive
from
me
a
letter
of
thanks
for
this,
and
for
every
other
mark
of
your
regard
during
my
stay
in
Hertfordshire.
As
for
my
fair
cousins,
though
my
absence
may
not
be
long
enough
to
render
it
necessary,
I
shall
now
take
the
liberty
of
wishing
them
health
and
happiness,
not
excepting
my
cousin
Elizabeth."
With
proper
civilities
the
ladies
then
withdrew;
all
of
them
equally
surprised
that
he
meditated
a
quick
return.
Mrs.
Bennet
wished
to
understand
by
it
that
he
thought
of
paying
his
addresses
to
one
of
