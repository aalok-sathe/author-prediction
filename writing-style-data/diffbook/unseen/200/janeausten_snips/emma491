all;
and
felt
some
curiosity
to
know
whether
the
wet
walk
of
this
morning
had
produced
any.
She
suspected
that
it
had;
that
it
would
not
have
been
so
resolutely
encountered
but
in
full
expectation
of
hearing
from
some
one
very
dear,
and
that
it
had
not
been
in
vain.
She
thought
there
was
an
air
of
greater
happiness
than
usual
a
glow
both
of
complexion
and
spirits.
She
could
have
made
an
inquiry
or
two,
as
to
the
expedition
and
the
expense
of
the
Irish
mails;
it
was
at
her
tongue's
end
but
she
abstained.
She
was
quite
determined
not
to
utter
a
word
that
should
hurt
Jane
Fairfax's
feelings;
and
they
followed
the
other
ladies
out
of
the
room,
arm
in
arm,
with
an
appearance
of
good
will
highly
becoming
to
the
beauty
and
grace
of
each.
When
the
ladies
returned
to
the
drawing
room
after
dinner,
Emma
found
it
hardly
possible
to
prevent
their
making
two
distinct
parties;
with
so
much
perseverance
in
judging
and
behaving
ill
did
Mrs.
Elton
engross
Jane
Fairfax
and
slight
herself.
She
and
Mrs.
Weston
were
obliged
to
be
almost
always
either
talking
together
or
silent
together.
Mrs.
Elton
left
them
