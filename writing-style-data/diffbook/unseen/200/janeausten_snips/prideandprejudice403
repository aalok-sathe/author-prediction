even
a
word
from
her
beyond
a
monosyllable.
Miss
Darcy
was
tall,
and
on
a
larger
scale
than
Elizabeth;
and,
though
little
more
than
sixteen,
her
figure
was
formed,
and
her
appearance
womanly
and
graceful.
She
was
less
handsome
than
her
brother;
but
there
was
sense
and
good
humour
in
her
face,
and
her
manners
were
perfectly

Elizabeth,

All
Elizabeth's
anger
against
him
had
been
long
done

but
had
she
still
felt
any,
it
could
hardly
have
stood
its
ground
against
the
unaffected
cordiality
with
which
he
expressed
himself
on
seeing
her
again.
He
inquired
in
a
friendly,
though
general
way,
after
her
family,
and
looked
and
spoke

the
same
good
humoured
