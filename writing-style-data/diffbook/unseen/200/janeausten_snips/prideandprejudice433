that
she
had
given
somewhat
of
a
trial
to
the
latter
method
in
her
partiality
for
Wickham,
and
that
its
ill
success
might,
perhaps,
authorise
her
to
seek
the
other
less
interesting
mode
of
attachment.
Be
that
as
it
may,
she
saw
him
go
with
regret;
and
in
this
early
example
of
what
Lydia's
infamy
must
produce,
found
additional
anguish
as
she
reflected
on
that
wretched
business.
Never,
since
reading
Jane's
second
letter,
had
she
entertained
a
hope
of
Wickham's
meaning
to
marry
her.
No
one
but
Jane,
she
thought,
could
flatter
herself
with
such
an
expectation.
Surprise
was
the
least
of
her
feelings
on
this
development.
While
the
contents
of
the
first
letter
remained
in
her
mind,
she
was
all
surprise
all
astonishment
that
Wickham
should
marry
a
girl
whom
it
was
impossible
he
could
marry
for
money;
and
how
Lydia
could
ever
have
attached
him
had
appeared
incomprehensible.
But
now
it
was
all
too
natural.
For
such
an
attachment
as
this
she
might
have
sufficient
charms;
and
though
she
did
not
suppose
Lydia
to
be
deliberately
engaging
in
an
elopement
without
the
intention
of
marriage,
she
had
no
difficulty
in
believing
that
neither
her
virtue
nor
her
understanding
