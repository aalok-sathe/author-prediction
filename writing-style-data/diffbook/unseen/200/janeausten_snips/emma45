not
afraid
of
what
any
body
can
do."
"You
understand
the
force
of
influence
pretty
well,
Harriet;
but
I
would
have
you
so
firmly
established
in
good
society,
as
to
be
independent
even
of
Hartfield
and
Miss
Woodhouse.
I
want
to
see
you
permanently
well
connected,
and
to
that
end
it
will
be
advisable
to
have
as
few
odd
acquaintance
as
may
be;
and,
therefore,
I
say
that
if
you
should
still
be
in
this
country
when
Mr.
Martin
marries,
I
wish
you
may
not
be
drawn
in
by
your
intimacy
with
the
sisters,
to
be
acquainted
with
the
wife,
who
will
probably
be
some
mere
farmer's
daughter,
without
education."
"To
be
sure.
Yes.
Not
that
I
think
Mr.
Martin
would
ever
marry
any
body
but
what
had
had
some
education
and
been
very
well
brought
up.
However,
I
do
not
mean
to
set
up
my
opinion
against
yours
and
I
am
sure
I
shall
not
wish
for
the
acquaintance
of
his
wife.
I
shall
always
have
a
great
regard
for
the
Miss
Martins,
especially
Elizabeth,
and
should
be
very
sorry
to
give
them
up,
for
they
are
quite
as
well
educated
as
me.
But
if
he
marries
a
