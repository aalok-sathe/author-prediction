before
he
complimented
Mrs.
Bennet
on
having
so
fine
a
family
of
daughters;
said
he
had
heard
much
of
their
beauty,
but
that
in
this
instance
fame
had
fallen
short
of
the
truth;
and
added,
that
he
did
not
doubt
her
seeing
them
all
in
due
time
disposed
of
in
marriage.
This
gallantry
was
not
much
to
the
taste
of
some
of
his
hearers;
but
Mrs.
Bennet,
who
quarreled
with
no
compliments,
answered
most
readily.
"You
are
very
kind,
I
am
sure;
and
I
wish
with
all

heart
it
may

to
my
poor
girls,
you
must
confess.
Not
that
I
mean
to
find
fault
with
you,
for
such
things
I
know
are
all
chance
in
this
world.
There
is
no
knowing
how
estates
will
go
when
once
they
come
to
be
entailed."
"I
am
very
sensible,
madam,
of
the
hardship
to
my
fair
cousins,
and
could
say
much
on
the
subject,
but
that
I
am
cautious
of
appearing
forward
and
precipitate.
But
I
can
assure
