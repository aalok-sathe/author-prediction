"Me!
I
should
be
quite
in
the
way.
But,
perhaps
I
may
be
equally
in
the
way
here.
Miss
Woodhouse
looks
as
if
she
did
not
want
me.
My
aunt
always
sends
me
off
when
she
is
shopping.
She
says
I

and
Miss
Woodhouse

said
Emma;
"I

Mrs.
Weston.
She
might
do

A
disagreeable
truth
would
be
palatable
through
her
lips,
but
I
am
the
wretchedest
being
in
the
world
at
a
civil
falsehood."
"I
do
not
believe
any
such

replied
Emma.
"I
am
persuaded
that
