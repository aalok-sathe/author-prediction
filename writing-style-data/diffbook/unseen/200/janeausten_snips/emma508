call
myself
an
addition.
But
perhaps
he
may
never
have
heard
of
there
being
such
a
creature
in
the
world."
This
was
too
loud
a
call
for
a
compliment
to
be
passed
by,
and
Mr.
Weston,
with
a
very
good
grace,
immediately
exclaimed,
"My
dear
madam!
Nobody
but
yourself
could
imagine
such
a

possible.
Not
heard
of
you!
I
believe
Mrs.

believed
me.
He
and
Mrs.
Weston
were

desponding.
'How
could
he
contrive
to
come?
And
how
could
it
be
supposed
that
his
uncle
and
aunt
would
spare
him
again?'
and
so

I
always
felt
that
something
would
happen
in
our
favour;
and
