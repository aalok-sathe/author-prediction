"It
is
only
evident
that
Miss
Bingley
does
not
mean
that
he
should."
"Why
will
you
think
so?
It
must
be
his
own
doing.
He
is
his
own
master.
But
you
do
not
know
all.
I
will
read

the
passage
which

hurts

"Mr.
Darcy
is
impatient
to
see
his
sister;
and,
to
confess
the
truth,
we
are
scarcely

eager
to
meet

and
