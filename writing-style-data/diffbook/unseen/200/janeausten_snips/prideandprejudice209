more
command
over
herself!
She
can
have
no
idea
of
the
pain
she
gives
me
by
her
continual
reflections
on
him.
But
I
will
not
repine.
It
cannot
last
long.
He
will
be
forgot,
and
we
shall
all
be
as
we
were
before."
Elizabeth
looked
at
her
sister
with
incredulous
solicitude,
but
said
nothing.
"You
doubt
me,"
cried
Jane,
slightly
colouring;
"indeed,
you
have
no
reason.
He
may
live
in
my
memory
as
the
most
amiable
man
of
my
acquaintance,
but
that

I
have
nothing

therefore
I
shall
certainly
try

get

With
a
stronger
voice
she
soon
added,
"I
have
this
comfort
immediately,
that
it
has
not
been
more
than
an
error
of
fancy
on
my
side,
and
that
it
has
done
no
harm
to
anyone
but
myself."
"My
dear
Jane!"
exclaimed
Elizabeth,
"you
are
too
good.
Your
sweetness
and
disinterestedness
are
really
angelic;
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
you.
I
feel
as
if
I
had
never
done
you
justice,
or
loved
you
as
you
deserve."
Miss
Bennet
eagerly
disclaimed
