of
this.
You
alluded
to
something
else.
You
mentioned
two
instances.
I
cannot
misunderstand
you,
but
I
entreat
you,
dear
Lizzy,
not
to
pain
me
by
thinking
that
person
to
blame,
and
saying
your
opinion
of
him
is
sunk.
We
must
not
be
so
ready
to
fancy
ourselves
intentionally
injured.
We
must
not
expect
a
lively
young
man
to
be
always
so
guarded
and
circumspect.
It
is
very
often
nothing
but
our
own
vanity
that
deceives
us.
Women
fancy
admiration
means
more
than
it
does."
"And
men
take
care
that
they
should."
"If
it
is
designedly
done,
they
cannot
be
justified;
but
I
have
no
idea
of
there
being
so
much
design
in
the
world
as
some
persons
imagine."
"I
am
far
from
attributing
any
part
of
Mr.
Bingley's
conduct
to
design,"
said
Elizabeth;
"but
without
scheming
to
do
wrong,
or
to
make
others
unhappy,
there
may
be
error,
and
there
may
be
misery.
Thoughtlessness,
want
of
attention
to
other
people's
feelings,
and
want
of
resolution,
will
do
the
business."
"And
do
you
impute
it
to
either
of
those?"
"Yes;
to
the
last.
But
if
I
go
on,
I
shall
displease
you
by
saying
what
I
think
of
persons
you
