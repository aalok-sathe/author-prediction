this
extraordinary
application
have
been
as
frivolous
as
the
application
was
ill
judged.
You
have
widely
mistaken
my
character,
if
you
think
I
can
be
worked
on
by
such
persuasions
as
these.
How
far
your
nephew
might
approve
of
your
interference
in
his
affairs,
I
cannot
tell;
but
you
have
certainly
no

I

to

importuned
no
farther

"Not

if
you

be
my
nephew's
sister?
Is
her
husband,

son
of
his
late
father's
steward,
to
be
his
brother?
Heaven
and
earth!
of
what
are
you
thinking?
Are
the
shades
of
Pemberley

be
thus

"You
can
now
have
nothing
further

she
resentfully
answered.
"You
