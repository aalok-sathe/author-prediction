his
duty.
"Pray,
Emma,"
said
he,
"may
I
ask
in
what
lay
the
great
amusement,
the
poignant
sting
of
the
last
word
given
to
you
and
Miss
Fairfax?
I
saw
the
word,
and
am
curious
to
know
how
it
could
be
so
very
entertaining
to
the
one,
and
so
very
distressing
to
the
other."
Emma
was
extremely
confused.
She
could
not
endure
to
give
him
the
true
explanation;
for
though
her
suspicions
were
by
no
means
removed,
she
was
really
ashamed
of
having
ever
imparted
them.
"Oh!"
she
cried
in
evident
embarrassment,
"it
all
meant
nothing;
a
mere
joke
among
ourselves."
"The
joke,"
he
replied
gravely,
"seemed
confined
to
you
and
Mr.
Churchill."
He
had
hoped
she
would
speak
again,
but
she
did
not.
She
would
rather
busy
herself
about
any
thing
than
speak.
He
sat
a
little
while
in
doubt.
A
variety
of
evils
crossed
his
mind.
Interference
fruitless
interference.
Emma's
confusion,
and
the
acknowledged
intimacy,
seemed
to
declare
her
affection
engaged.
Yet
he
would
speak.
He
owed
it
to
her,
to
risk
any
thing
that
might
be
involved
in
an
unwelcome
interference,
rather
than
her
welfare;
to
encounter
any
thing,
rather
than
the
remembrance
of
neglect
in
such
