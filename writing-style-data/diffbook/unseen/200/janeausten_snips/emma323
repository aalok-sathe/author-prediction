do
any
thing
in
Highbury!
The
want
of
proper
families
in
the
place,
and
the
conviction
that
none
beyond
the
place
and
its
immediate
environs
could
be
tempted
to
attend,
were
mentioned;
but
he
was
not
satisfied.
He
could
not
be
persuaded
that
so
many
good
looking
houses
as
he
saw
around
him,
could
not
furnish
numbers
enough
for
such
a
meeting;
and
even
when
particulars
were
given
and
families
described,
he
was
still
unwilling
to
admit
that
the
inconvenience
of
such
a
mixture
would
be
any
thing,
or
that
there
would
be
the
smallest
difficulty
in
every
body's
returning
into
their
proper
place
the
next
morning.
He
argued
like
a
young
man
very
much
bent
on
dancing;
and
Emma
was
rather
surprized
to
see
the
constitution
of
the
Weston
prevail
so
decidedly
against
the
habits
of
the
Churchills.
He
seemed
to
have
all
the
life
and
spirit,
cheerful
feelings,
and
social
inclinations
of
his
father,
and
nothing
of
the
pride
or
reserve
of
Enscombe.
Of
pride,
indeed,
there
was,
perhaps,
scarcely
enough;
his
indifference
to
a
confusion
of
rank,
bordered
too
much
on
inelegance
of
mind.
He
could
be
no
judge,
however,
of
the
evil
he
was
holding
cheap.
