have
convinced
you
perhaps,
but
I
am
perfectly
convinced
myself
that
Mr.
Dixon
is
a
principal
in
the
business."
"Indeed
you
injure
me
if
you
suppose
me
unconvinced.
Your
reasonings
carry
my
judgment
along
with
them
entirely.
At
first,
while
I
supposed
you
satisfied
that
Colonel
Campbell
was
the
giver,
I
saw
it
only
as
paternal
kindness,
and
thought
it
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world.
But
when
you
mentioned
Mrs.
Dixon,
I
felt
how
much
more
probable
that
it
should
be
the
tribute
of
warm
female
friendship.
And
now
I
can
see
it
in
no
other
light
than
as
an
offering
of
love."

occasion

he

She
said
no
more,
other
subjects
took
their
turn;
and
the
rest
of
the
dinner
passed
away;
the
dessert
succeeded,
the
children
came
in,
and
were
talked
to
and
admired
amid
the
usual
rate
of
conversation;
a
few
clever
things
said,
a
few
downright
silly,
but
by
much
the
larger
proportion
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
nothing
worse
than
everyday
remarks,
dull
repetitions,
old
news,
and
heavy
jokes.
The
ladies
had
not
been
