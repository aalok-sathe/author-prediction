despise
the
place
rather
too
much.
She
questioned
him
as
to
the
society
in
Yorkshire
the
extent
of
the
neighbourhood
about
Enscombe,
and
the
sort;
and
could
make
out
from
his
answers
that,
as
far
as
Enscombe
was
concerned,
there
was
very
little
going
on,
that
their
visitings
were
among
a
range
of
great
families,
none
very
near;
and
that
even
when
days
were
fixed,
and
invitations
accepted,
it
was
an
even
chance
that
Mrs.
Churchill
were
not
in
health
and
spirits
for
going;
that
they
made
a
point
of

address
at
times,
that
he
could
get
away,
or
introduce
an
acquaintance
for
a
night.
She

and
that
Highbury,
taken
at
its
best,
might
reasonably
please
a
young
man
who
had
more
retirement
at
home
than
he
liked.
His
importance
at
Enscombe
was
very
evident.
He
did
not
boast,
but
it
naturally
betrayed
itself,
that
he
had
persuaded
his
aunt
where
his
uncle
could
do
nothing,
and
on
her
laughing
and
noticing
it,
he
owned
that
he
believed
(excepting
one
or
two
points)
he
could
