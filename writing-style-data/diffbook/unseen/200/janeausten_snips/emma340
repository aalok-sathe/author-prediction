it
as
they
walked
about
Highbury
the
day
before,
and
Frank
Churchill
had
most
earnestly
lamented
her
absence.
Might
not
the
evening
end
in
a
dance?
had
been
a
question
of
his.
The
bare
possibility
of
it
acted
as
a
farther
irritation
on
her
spirits;
and
her
being
left
in
solitary
grandeur,
even
supposing
the
omission
to
be
intended
as
a
compliment,
was
but
poor
comfort.
It
was
the
arrival
of
this
very
invitation
while
the
Westons
were
at
Hartfield,
which
made
their
presence
so
acceptable;
for
though
her
first
remark,
on
reading
it,
was
that
"of
course
it
must
be
declined,"
she
so
very
soon
proceeded
to
ask
them
what
they
advised
her
to
do,
that
their
advice
for
her
going
was
most
prompt
and
successful.
She
owned
that,
considering
every
thing,
she
was
not
absolutely
without
inclination
for
the
party.
The
Coles
expressed
themselves
so
properly
there
was
so
much
real
attention
in
the
manner
of
it
so
much
consideration
for
her
father.
"They
would
have
solicited
the
honour
earlier,
but
had
been
waiting
the
arrival
of
a
folding
screen
from
London,
which
they
hoped
might
keep
Mr.
Woodhouse
from
any
draught
of
air,
and
therefore
induce
him
