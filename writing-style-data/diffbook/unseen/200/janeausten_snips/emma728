Highbury,
and
my
business
was
to
get
my
body
thither
as
often
as
might
be,
and
with
the
least
suspicion.
If
you
remember
any
queernesses,
set
them
all
to
the
right
account.
Of
the
pianoforte
so
much
talked
of,
I
feel
it
only
necessary
to
say,
that
its
being
ordered
was
absolutely
unknown
to
Miss
F
,
who
would
never
have
allowed
me
to
send
it,
had
any
choice
been
given
her.
The
delicacy
of
her
mind
throughout
the
whole
engagement,
my
dear
madam,
is
much
beyond
my
power
of
doing
justice
to.
You
will
soon,
I
earnestly
hope,
know
her
thoroughly
yourself.
No
description
can
describe
her.
She
must
tell
you
herself
what
she
is
yet
not
by
word,
for
never
was
there
a
human
creature
who
would
so
designedly
suppress
her
own
merit.
Since
I
began
this
letter,
which
will
be
longer
than
I
foresaw,
I
have
heard
from
her.
She
gives
a
good
account
of
her
own
health;
but
as
she
never
complains,
I
dare
not
depend.
I
want
to
have
your
opinion
of
her
looks.
I
know
you
will
soon
call
on
her;
she
is
living
in
dread
of
the
visit.
Perhaps
it
is
paid
already.
