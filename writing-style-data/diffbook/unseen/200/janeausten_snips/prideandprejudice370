other
period
for
the
commencement
of
actual
felicity
to
have
some
other
point
on
which
her
wishes
and
hopes
might
be
fixed,
and
by
again
enjoying
the
pleasure
of
anticipation,
console
herself
for
the
present,
and
prepare
for
another
disappointment.
Her
tour
to
the
Lakes
was
now
the
object
of
her
happiest
thoughts;
it
was
her
best
consolation
for
all
the
uncomfortable
hours
which
the
discontentedness
of
her
mother
and
Kitty
made
inevitable;
and
could
she
have
included
Jane
in
the
scheme,
every
part
of
it
would
have
been
perfect.
"But
it
is
fortunate,"
thought
she,
"that
I
have
something
to
wish
for.
Were
the
whole
arrangement
complete,
my
disappointment
would
be
certain.
But
here,
by
carrying
with
me
one
ceaseless
source
of
regret
in
my
sister's
absence,
I
may
reasonably
hope
to
have
all
my
expectations
of
pleasure
realised.
A
scheme
of
which
every
part
promises
delight
can
never
be
successful;
and
general
disappointment
is
only
warded
off
by
the
defence
of
some
little
peculiar
vexation."
When
Lydia
went
away
she
promised
to
write
very
often
and
very
minutely
to
her
mother
and
Kitty;
but
her
letters
were
always
long
expected,
and
always
very
short.
