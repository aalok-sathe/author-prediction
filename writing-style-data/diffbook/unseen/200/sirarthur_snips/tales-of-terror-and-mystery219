down
the
street.
In
passing
me,
I
noticed
that
he
cast
an
inquisitive
and
somewhat
malevolent
glance
at
me,
and
I
took
the
incident
as
a
good
omen,
for
his
appearance
was
that
of
a
rejected
candidate,
and
if
he
resented
my
application
it
meant
that
the
vacancy
was
not
yet
filled
up.
Full
of
hope,
I
ascended
the
broad
steps
and
rapped
with
the
heavy
knocker.
A
footman
in
powder
and
livery
opened
the
door.
Clearly
I
was
in
touch
with
the
people
of
wealth
and
fashion.
"Yes,
sir?"
said
the
footman.
"I
came
in
answer
to
"
"Quite
so,
sir,"
said
the
footman.
"Lord
Linchmere
will
see
you
at
once
in
the
library."
Lord
Linchmere!
I
had
vaguely
heard
the
name,
but
could
not
for
the
instant
recall
anything
about
him.
Following
the
footman,
I
was
shown
into
a
large,
book
lined
room
in
which
there
was
seated
behind
a
writing
desk
a
small
man
with
a
pleasant,
clean
shaven,
mobile
face,
and
long
hair
shot
with
grey,
brushed
back
from
his
forehead.
He
looked
me
up
and
down
with
a
very
shrewd,
penetrating
glance,
holding
the
card
which
the
footman
had
given
him
in
his
right
hand.
