him.
He
had
formerly
been
an
intimate
friend
of
the
deceased
man;
but
circumstances,
which
he
would
prefer
not
to
mention,
had
brought
about
a
change
in
his
sentiments.
There
were
several
facts
which
supported
his
innocence.
It
was
certain
that
Dr.
Lana
was
alive
and
in
his
study
at
half
past
eleven
o'clock.
Mrs.
Woods
was
prepared
to
swear
that
it
was
at
that
hour
that
she
had
heard
his
voice.
The
friends
of
the
prisoner
contended
that
it
was
probable
that
at
that
time
Dr.
Lana
was
not
alone.
The
sound
which
had
originally
attracted
the
attention
of
the
housekeeper,
and
her
master's
unusual
impatience
that
she
should
leave
him
in
peace,
seemed
to
point
to
that.
If
this
were
so
then
it
appeared
to
be
probable
that
he
had
met
his
end
between
the
moment
when
the
housekeeper
heard
his
voice
and
the
time
when
Mrs.
Madding
made
her
first
call
and
found
it
impossible
to
attract
his
attention.
But
if
this
were
the
time
of
his
death,
then
it
was
certain
that
Mr.
Arthur
Morton
could
not
be
guilty,
as
it
was
AFTER
this
that
she
had
met
the
young
squire
at
the
gate.
If
