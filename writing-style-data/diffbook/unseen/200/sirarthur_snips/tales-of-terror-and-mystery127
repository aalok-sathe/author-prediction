the
Cat
Walk,
and
one
of
Mrs.
Moulton's.
Four
in
all
during
three
nights.
No
trace
is
left
of
them
at
all,
and
the
countryside
is
buzzing
with
rumours
of
gipsies
and
of
sheep
stealers.
But
there
is
something
more
serious
than
that.
Young
Armitage
has
disappeared
also.
He
left
his
moorland
cottage
early
on
Wednesday
night
and
has
never
been
heard
of
since.
He
was
an
unattached
man,
so
there
is
less
sensation
than
would
otherwise
be
the
case.
The
popular
explanation
is
that
he
owes
money,
and
has
found
a
situation
in
some
other
part
of
the
country,
whence
he
will
presently
write
for
his
belongings.
But
I
have
grave
misgivings.
Is
it
not
much
more
likely
that
the
recent
tragedy
of
the
sheep
has
caused
him
to
take
some
steps
which
may
have
ended
in
his
own
destruction?
He
may,
for
example,
have
lain
in
wait
for
the
creature
and
been
carried
off
by
it
into
the
recesses
of
the
mountains.
What
an
inconceivable
fate
for
a
civilized
Englishman
of
the
twentieth
century!
And
yet
I
feel
that
it
is
possible
and
even
probable.
But
in
that
case,
how
far
am
I
answerable
both
for
his
death
