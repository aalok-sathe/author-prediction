after
learning
that
his
only
course
was
to
take
the
ordinary
slow
train
which
leaves
Liverpool
at
six
o'clock.
At
four
thirty
one
exactly
by
the
station
clock
the
special
train,
containing
the
crippled
Monsieur
Caratal
and
his
gigantic
companion,
steamed
out
of
the
Liverpool
station.
The
line
was
at
that
time
clear,
and
there
should
have
been
no
stoppage
before
Manchester.
The
trains
of
the
London
and
West
Coast
Railway
run
over
the
lines
of
another
company
as
far
as
this
town,
which
should
have
been
reached
by
the
special
rather
before
six
o'clock.
At
a
quarter
after
six
considerable
surprise
and
some
consternation
were
caused
amongst
the
officials
at
Liverpool
by
the
receipt
of
a
telegram
from
Manchester
to
say
that
it
had
not
yet
arrived.
An
inquiry
directed
to
St.
Helens,
which
is
a
third
of
the
way
between
the
two
cities,
elicited
the
following
reply
"To
James
Bland,
Superintendent,
Central
L.
&
W.
C.,
Liverpool.
Special
passed
here
at
4:52,
well
up
to
time.
Dowster,
St.
Helens."
This
telegram
was
received
at
six
forty.
At
six
fifty
a
second
message
was
received
from
Manchester
"No
sign
of
special
as
advised
by
you."
And
then
ten
minutes
