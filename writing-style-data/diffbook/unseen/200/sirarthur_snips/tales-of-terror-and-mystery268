of

life.
But
I
knew
that
this
man
Sparrow
MacCoy
had
a
great
influence
over
Edward
and
my
chance
of
keeping
the
lad
straight
lay
in
breaking
the
connection
between
them.
I
had
a
friend
in
the
New
York
detective
force,
and
through
him
I
kept
a
watch
upon
MacCoy.
When,
within
a
fortnight
of
my
brother's
sailing,
I
heard
that
MacCoy
had
taken
a
berth
in
the
Etruria,
I
was
as
certain
as
if
he
had
told
me
that
he
was
going
over
to

purpose
of
coaxing
Edward
back
again
into
the
ways
that
he
had
left.
In
an
instant
I
had
resolved
to
go
also,
and
to
pit
my
influence
against
MacCoy's.
I
knew
it
was
a
losing
fight,
but
I
thought,
and
my
mother
thought,
that
it
was
my
duty.
We
passed
the
last
night
together
in
prayer
for
my
success,
and
she
gave
me
her
own
Testament
that
my
father
had
given
her
on
the
day
of
their
marriage
in
the
Old
Country,
so
that
I
might
always
wear
it
next
my
heart.
