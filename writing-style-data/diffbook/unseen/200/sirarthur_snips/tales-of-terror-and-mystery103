pocket.
But
Douglas
Stone
was
still
picking
at
the
coverlet.
"You
see
you
have
kept
your
appointment
after
all,"
said
Lord
Sannox.
And
at
that
Douglas
Stone
began
to
laugh.
He
laughed
long
and
loudly.
But
Lord
Sannox
did
not
laugh
now.
Something
like
fear
sharpened
and
hardened
his
features.
He
walked
from
the
room,
and
he
walked
on
tiptoe.
The
old
woman
was
waiting
outside.
"Attend
to
your
mistress
when
she
awakes,"
said
Lord
Sannox.
Then
he
went
down
to
the
street.
The
cab
was
at
the
door,
and
the
driver
raised
his
hand
to
his
hat.
"John,"
said
Lord
Sannox,
"you
will
take
the
doctor
home
first.
He
will
want
leading
downstairs,
I
think.
Tell
his
butler
that
he
has
been
taken
ill
at
a
case."
"Very
good,
sir."
"Then
you
can
take
Lady
Sannox
home."
"And
how
about
yourself,
sir?"
"Oh,
my
address
for
the
next
few
months
will
be
Hotel
di
Roma,
Venice.
Just
see
that
the
letters
are
sent
on.
And
tell
Stevens
to
exhibit
all
the
purple
chrysanthemums
next
Monday,
and
to
wire
me
the
result."
