at
Coltbridge
it
was
I
who
sat
up
in
the
haunted
house.
Is
it
advancing
years
(after
all,
I
am
only
thirty
five),
or
is
it
this
physical
malady
which
has
caused
degeneration?
Certainly
my
heart
quails
when
I
think
of
that
horrible
cavern
in
the
hill,
and
the
certainty
that
it
has
some
monstrous
occupant.
What
shall
I
do?
There
is
not
an
hour
in
the
day
that
I
do
not
debate
the
question.
If
I
say
nothing,
then
the
mystery
remains
unsolved.
If
I
do
say
anything,
then
I
have
the
alternative
of
mad
alarm
over
the
whole
countryside,
or
of
absolute
incredulity
which
may
end
in
consigning
me
to
an
asylum.
On
the
whole,
I
think
that
my
best
course
is
to
wait,
and
to
prepare
for
some
expedition
which
shall
be
more
deliberate
and
better
thought
out
than
the
last.
As
a
first
step
I
have
been
to
Castleton
and
obtained
a
few
essentials
a
large
acetylene
lantern
for
one
thing,
and
a
good
double
barrelled
sporting
rifle
for
another.
The
latter
I
have
hired,
but
I
have
bought
a
dozen
heavy
game
cartridges,
which
would
bring
down
a
rhinoceros.
Now
I
am
ready
