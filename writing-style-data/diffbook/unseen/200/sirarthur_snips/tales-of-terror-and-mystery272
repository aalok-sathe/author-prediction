by
all
that
he
owed
to
my
mother
might
even
now
be
the
salvation
of
him.
My
nerves
were
overstrung,
and
I
lit
a
cigar
to
steady
them.
At
that
moment,
just
as
the
train
was
moving
off,
the
door
of
my
compartment
was
flung
open,
and
there
were
MacCoy
and
my
brother
on
the
platform.
"They
were
both
disguised,
and
with
good
reason,
for
they
knew
that
the

He
said
something,
the
conductor
slammed
the
door,
and
they
were
shown
into
the
next
compartment.
I
tried
to
stop
the
train
so
as
to
follow
them,
but
the
wheels
were
already
moving,
and
it
was
too

carriage.
