came
the
shuffle
and
creak
which
told
of
a
fresh
advance.
My
companion
was
trembling
with
excitement.
His
hand,
which
still
held
my
sleeve,
twitched
like
a
branch
in
the
wind.
"What
is
it?"
I
whispered.
"It's
he!"
"Sir
Thomas?"
"Yes."
"What
does

crouching,
with
the
silhouette
of
a
bulky
and
misshapen
dwarf.
Slowly
the
door
swung
open
with
this
ominous
shape
framed
in
the
centre
of
it.
And
then,
in
an
instant,
the
crouching
figure
shot
up,
there
was
a
tiger
spring
across
the
room
and
thud,
thud,
thud,
came
three
tremendous
blows
from
some
heavy
object
upon
the
bed.
I
was
so
paralysed
with
amazement
