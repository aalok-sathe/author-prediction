ranks
himself,
and
I
believe
that
in
his
youth
he
was
not
above
scaring
crows
in
these
very
fields.
It
is
a
most
lonely
spot,
and
the
walks
are
picturesque
in
the
extreme.
The
farm
consists
of
grazing
land
lying
at
the
bottom
of
an
irregular
valley.
On
each
side
are
the
fantastic
limestone
hills,
formed
of
rock
so
soft
that
you
can
break
it
away
with
your
hands.
All
this
country
is
hollow.
Could
you
strike
it
with
some
gigantic
hammer
it
would
boom
like
a
drum,
or
possibly
cave
in
altogether
and
expose
some
huge
subterranean
sea.
A
great
sea
there
must
surely
be,
for
on
all
sides
the
streams
run
into
the
mountain
itself,
never
to
reappear.
There
are
gaps
everywhere
amid
the
rocks,
and
when
you
pass
through
them
you
find
yourself
in
great
caverns,
which
wind
down
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth.
I
have
a
small
bicycle
lamp,
and
it
is
a
perpetual
joy
to
me
to
carry
it
into
these
weird
solitudes,
and
to
see
the
wonderful
silver
and
black
effect
when
I
throw
its
light
upon
the
stalactites
which
drape
the
lofty
roofs.
Shut
off
the
lamp,
and
you
are
in
the
