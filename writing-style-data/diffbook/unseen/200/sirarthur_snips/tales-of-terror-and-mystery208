stoker
did
his
business
so
clumsily
that
Slater
in
his
struggles
fell
off
the
engine,
and
though
fortune
was
with
us
so
far
that
he
broke
his
neck
in
the
fall,
still
he
remained
as
a
blot
upon
that
which
would
otherwise
have
been
one
of
those
complete
masterpieces
which
are
only
to
be
contemplated
in
silent
admiration.
The
criminal
expert
will
find
in
John
Slater
the
one
flaw
in
all
our
admirable
combinations.
A
man
who
has
had
as
many
triumphs
as
I
can
afford

a
flaw.

or
rather
more

in

which
leads,
or
rather

lead,
to
the
abandoned
Heartsease
mine,
once
one
of
the
largest
coal
mines
in
England.
You
will
ask
how
it
is
that
no
one
saw
the
train
upon
this
unused
line.
I
answer
that
along
its
entire
length
it
runs
through
a
deep
cutting,
and
that,
unless
someone
had
been
on
the
edge
of
that
cutting,
