had
to
answer
or
avoid
the
same
question.
"You've
heard
the
voice,
Colmore?"
said
the
agent.
I
confessed
that
I
had.
"And
what
do
YOU
think
of
it?"
I
shrugged
my
shoulders,
and
remarked
that
it
was
no
business
of
mine.
"Come,
come,
you
are
just
as
curious
as
any
of
us.
Is
it
a
woman
or
not?"
"It
is
certainly
a
woman."
"Which
room
did
you
hear
it
from?"
"From
the
turret
room,
before
the
ceiling
fell."
"But
I
heard
it
from
the
library
only
last
night.
I
passed
the
doors
as
I
was
going
to
bed,
and
I
heard
something
wailing
and
praying
just
as
plainly
as
I
hear
you.
It
may
be
a
woman
"
"Why,
what
else
COULD
it
be?"
He
looked
at
me
hard.
"There
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth,"
said
he.
"If
it
is
a
woman,
how
does
she
get
there?"
"I
don't
know."
"No,
nor
I.
But
if
it
is
the
other
thing
but
there,
for
a
practical
business
man
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
this
is
rather
a
ridiculous
line
of
conversation."
He
turned
away,
but
I
saw
that
he
felt
even
more
than
he
had
said.
