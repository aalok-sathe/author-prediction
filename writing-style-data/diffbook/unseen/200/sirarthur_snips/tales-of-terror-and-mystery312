this
particular
night
Martha
Woods
went
into
the
doctor's
study
at
half
past
nine,
and
found
him
writing
at
his
desk.
She
bade
him
good
night,
sent
the
maid
to
bed,
and
then
occupied
herself
until
a
quarter
to
eleven
in
household
matters.
It
was
striking
eleven
upon
the
hall
clock
when
she
went
to
her
own
room.
She
had
been
there
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
twenty
minutes
when
she
heard
a
cry
or
call,
which
appeared
to
come
from
within
the
house.
She
waited
some
time,
but
it
was
not
repeated.
Much
alarmed,
for
the
sound
was
loud
and
urgent,
she
put
on
a
dressing
gown,
and
ran
at
the
top
of
her
speed
to
the
doctor's
study.
"Who's
there?"
cried
a
voice,
as
she
tapped
at
the
door.
"I
am
here,
sir
Mrs.
Woods."
"I
beg
that
you
will
leave
me
in
peace.
Go
back
to
your
room
this
instant!"
cried
the
voice,
which
was,
to
the
best
of
her
belief,
that
of
her
master.
The
tone
was
so
harsh
and
so
unlike
her
master's
usual
manner,
that
she
was
surprised
and
hurt.
"I
thought
I
heard
you
calling,
sir,"
she
explained,
but
no
answer
