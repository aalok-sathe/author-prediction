someone
had
scraped
all
round
them.
The
stones
were
in
their
places,
but
the
beautiful
gold
work
which
we
had
admired
only
a
few
days
before
had
been
very
clumsily
pulled
about.
"It
looks
to
me,"
said
the
police
inspector,
"as
if
someone
had
been
trying
to
take
out
the
stones."
"My
fear
is,"
said
Mortimer,
"that
he
not
only
tried,
but

these
four
stones
to
be
skilful
imitations
which

will
pledge

reputation
that
all
four
of
these
stones
are
genuine,
and
of
a
most
unusual
degree
of
purity."
The
colour
began
to
come
back
to
my
poor
friend's
frightened
face,
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief.
"Thank
God!"
he
cried.
"Then
what
in
the
world
did
the
thief
want?"
"Probably
he
meant
to
take
the
stones,
but
was
interrupted."
"In
that
case
one
would
expect
