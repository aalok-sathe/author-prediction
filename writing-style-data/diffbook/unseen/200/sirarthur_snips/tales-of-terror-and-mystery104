James
Hardcastle,
who
died
of
phthisis
on
February
4th,
1908,
at
36,
Upper
Coventry
Flats,
South
Kensington.
Those
who
knew
him
best,
while
refusing
to
express
an
opinion
upon
this
particular
statement,
are
unanimous
in
asserting
that
he
was
a
man
of
a
sober
and
scientific
turn
of
mind,
absolutely
devoid
of
imagination,
and
most
unlikely
to
invent
any
abnormal
series
of
events.
The
paper
was
contained
in
an
envelope,
which
was
docketed,
"A
Short
Account
of
the
Circumstances
which
occurred
near
Miss
Allerton's
Farm
in
North
West
Derbyshire
in
the
Spring
of
Last
Year."
The
envelope
was
sealed,
and
on
the
other
side
was
written
in
pencil
DEAR
SEATON,
"It
may
interest,
and
perhaps
pain
you,
to
know
that
the
incredulity
with
which
you
met
my
story
has
prevented
me
from
ever
opening
my
mouth
upon
the
subject
again.
I
leave
this
record
after
my
death,
and
perhaps
strangers
may
be
found
to
have
more
confidence
in
me
than
my
friend."
Inquiry
has
failed
to
elicit
who
this
Seaton
may
have
been.
I
may
add
that
the
visit
of
the
deceased
to
Allerton's
Farm,
and
the
general
nature
of
the
alarm
there,
apart
from
his
particular
explanation,
have
