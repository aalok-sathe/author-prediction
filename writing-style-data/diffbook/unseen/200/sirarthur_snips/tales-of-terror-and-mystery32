go
once
again
before
I
give
my
results
to
the
world.
My
reason
for
this
is
that
I
must
surely
have
something
to
show
by
way
of
proof
before
I
lay
such
a
tale
before
my
fellow
men.
It
is
true
that
others
will
soon
follow
and
will
confirm
what
I
have
said,
and
yet
I
should
wish
to
carry
conviction
from
the
first.
Those
lovely
iridescent
bubbles
of
the
air
should
not
be
hard
to
capture.
They
drift
slowly
upon
their
way,
and
the
swift
monoplane
could
intercept
their
leisurely
course.
It
is
likely
enough
that
they
would
dissolve
in
the
heavier
layers
of
the
atmosphere,
and
that
some
small
heap
of
amorphous
jelly
might
be
all
that
I
should
bring
to
earth
with
me.
And
yet
something
there
would
surely
be
by
which
I
could
substantiate
my
story.
Yes,
I
will
go,
even
if
I
run
a
risk
by
doing
so.
These
purple
horrors
would
not
seem
to
be
numerous.
It
is
probable
that
I
shall
not
see
one.
If
I
do
I
shall
dive
at
once.
At
the
