towards
me.
His
hatred
rose
to
the
height
of
a
mania.
I
had
been
rolling
in
money
in
England,
according
to
his
account,
while
he
had
been
starving
in
South
America.
I
cannot
describe
to
you
the
threats
which
he
uttered
or
the
insults
which
he
poured
upon
me.
My
impression
is,
that
hardships
and
debauchery
had
unhinged
his
reason.
He
paced
about
the
room
like
a
wild
beast,
demanding
drink,
demanding
money,
and
all
in
the
foulest
language.
I
am
a
hot
tempered
man,
but
I
thank
God
that
I
am
able
to
say
that
I
remained
master
of
myself,
and
that
I
never
raised
a

against
him.
My
coolness
only
irritated
him

He
raved,
he
cursed,
he
shook
his
fists
in
my
face,
and
then
suddenly
a
horrible
spasm
passed
over
his
features,
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
side,
and
with
a
loud
cry
he
fell
in
a
heap
at
my
feet.
I
raised
him
up
and
stretched
him
upon
the
sofa,
but
no
answer
came
to
my
exclamations,
and
the
hand
which
I
held
in
mine
was
cold
and
clammy.
His
diseased
heart
had
broken
down.
His
own
violence
had
killed
him.
