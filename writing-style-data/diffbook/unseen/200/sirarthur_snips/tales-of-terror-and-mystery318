young
squire,
was
immediately
arrested.
The
evidence
against
him
was
circumstantial,
but
damning.
He
was
devoted
to
his
sister,
and
it
was
shown
that
since
the
rupture
between
her
and
Dr.
Lana
he
had
been
heard
again
and
again
to
express
himself
in
the
most
vindictive
terms
towards
her
former
lover.
He
had,
as
stated,
been
seen
somewhere
about
eleven
o'clock
entering
the
doctor's
drive
with
a
hunting
crop
in
his
hand.
He
had
then,
according
to
the
theory
of
the
police,
broken
in
upon
the
doctor,
whose
exclamation
of
fear
or
of
anger
had
been
loud
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
Mrs.
Woods.
When
Mrs.
Woods
descended,
Dr.
Lana
had
made
up
his
mind
to
talk
it
over
with
his
visitor,
and
had,
therefore,
sent
his
housekeeper
back
to
her
room.
This
conversation
had
lasted
a
long
time,
had
become
more
and
more
fiery,
and
had
ended
by
a
personal
struggle,
in
which
the
doctor
lost
his
life.
The
fact,
revealed
by
a
post
mortem,
that
his
heart
was
much
diseased
an
ailment
quite
unsuspected
during
his
life
would
make
it
possible
that
death
might
in
his
case
ensue
from
injuries
which
would
not
be
fatal
to
a
