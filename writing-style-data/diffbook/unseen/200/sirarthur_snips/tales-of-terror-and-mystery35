and
an
amusement
for
his
friends.
A
wealthy
man
of
refined
and
eccentric
tastes,
he
had
spent
much
of
his
life
and
fortune
in
gathering
together
what
was
said
to
be
a
unique
private
collection
of
Talmudic,
cabalistic,
and
magical
works,
many
of
them
of
great
rarity
and
value.
His
tastes
leaned
toward
the
marvellous
and
the
monstrous,
and
I
have
heard
that
his
experiments
in
the
direction
of
the
unknown
have
passed
all
the
bounds
of
civilization
and
of
decorum.
To
his
English
friends
he
never
alluded
to
such
matters,
and
took
the
tone
of
the
student
and
virtuoso;
but
a
Frenchman
whose
tastes
were
of
the
same
nature
has
assured
me
that
the
worst
excesses
of
the
black
mass
have
been
perpetrated
in
that
large
and
lofty
hall,
which
is
lined
with
the
shelves
of
his
books,
and
the
cases
of
his
museum.
Dacre's
appearance
was
enough
to
show
that
his
deep
interest
in
these
psychic
matters
was
intellectual
rather
than
spiritual.
There
was
no
trace
of
asceticism
upon
his
heavy
face,
but
there
was
much
mental
force
in
his
huge,
dome
like
skull,
which
curved
upward
from
amongst
his
thinning
locks,
like
a
snowpeak
above
its
fringe
