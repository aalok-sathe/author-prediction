for
my
troglodyte
friend.
Give
me
better
health
and
a
little
spate
of
energy,
and
I
shall
try
conclusions
with
him
yet.
But
who
and
what
is
he?
Ah!
there
is
the
question
which
stands
between
me
and
my
sleep.
How
many
theories
do
I
form,
only
to
discard
each
in
turn!
It
is
all
so
utterly
unthinkable.
And
yet
the
cry,
the
footmark,
the
tread
in
the
cavern
no
reasoning
can
get
past
these
I
think
of
the
old
world
legends
of
dragons
and
of
other
monsters.
Were
they,
perhaps,
not
such
fairy
tales
as
we
have
thought?
Can
it
be
that
there
is
some
fact
which
underlies
them,
and
am
I,
of
all
mortals,
the
one
who
is
chosen
to
expose
it?
May
3.
For
several
days
I
have
been
laid
up
by
the
vagaries
of
an
English
spring,
and
during
those
days
there
have
been
developments,
the
true
and
sinister
meaning
of
which
no
one
can
appreciate
save
myself.
I
may
say
that
we
have
had
cloudy
and
moonless
nights
of
late,
which
according
to
my
information
were
the
seasons
upon
which
sheep
disappeared.
Well,
sheep
have
disappeared.
