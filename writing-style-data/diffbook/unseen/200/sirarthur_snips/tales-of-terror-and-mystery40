"Have
you
included
the
psychology
of
dreams
among
your
learned
studies?"
he
asked.
"I
did
not
even
know
that
there
was
such
a
psychology."
"My
dear
sir,
that
shelf
above
the
gem
case
is
filled
with
volumes,
from
Albertus
Magnus
onward,
which
deal
with
no
other
subject.
It
is
a
science
in

"A
science
of
charlatans!"
"The

reduced
to

When

comes
the
researches
of
our
friends
on
the
bookshelf
yonder
will
no

be
the

the

of
a

"Supposing
that
is
so,
what
has
the
science
of
dreams
to
do
with
a
large,
black,
brass
rimmed
funnel?"
"I
will
tell
you.
You
know
that
I
have
an
agent
who
is
always
on
the
look
out
for
rarities
and
curiosities
for
my
collection.
Some
