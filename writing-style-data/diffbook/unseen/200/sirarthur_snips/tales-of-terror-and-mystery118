to
get
clear
of
the
danger.
There
was
only
one
hope,
and
that
was
that
the
matches
might
dry.
When
I
fell
into
the
river,
only
half
of
me
had
got
thoroughly
wet.
My
left
shoulder
had
remained
above
the
water.
I
took
the
box
of
matches,
therefore,
and
put
it
into
my
left
armpit.
The
moist
air
of
the
cavern
might
possibly
be
counteracted
by
the
heat
of
my
body,
but
even
so,
I
knew
that
I
could
not
hope
to
get
a
light
for
many
hours.
Meanwhile
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait.
By
good
luck
I
had
slipped
several
biscuits
into
my
pocket
before
I
left
the
farm
house.
These
I
now
devoured,
and
washed
them
down
with
a
draught
from
that
wretched
stream
which
had
been
the
cause
of
all
my
misfortunes.
Then
I
felt
about
for
a
comfortable
seat
among
the
rocks,
and,
having
discovered
a
place
where
I
could
get
a
support
for
my
back,
I
stretched
out
my
legs
and
settled
myself
down
to
wait.
I
was
wretchedly
damp
and
cold,
but
I
tried
to
cheer
myself
with
the
reflection
that
modern
science
prescribed
open
windows
and
walks
in
all
weather
