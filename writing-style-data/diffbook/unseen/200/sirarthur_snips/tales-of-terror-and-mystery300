all
the
old
ghost
stories
of
Thorpe
Place
a
new
one
was
being
added
before
our
very
eyes.
It
may
by
this
time
have
taken
its
permanent
place,
for
though
an
explanation
came
to
me,
it
never
reached
the
others.
And
my
explanation
came
in
this
way.
I
had
suffered
a
sleepless
night
from
neuralgia,
and
about
midday
I
had
taken
a
heavy
dose
of
chlorodyne
to
alleviate
the
pain.
At
that
time
I
was
finishing
the
indexing
of
Sir
John
Bollamore's
library,
and
it
was
my
custom
to
work
there
from
five
till
seven.
On
this
particular
day
I
struggled
against
the
double
effect
of
my
bad
night
and
the
narcotic.
I
have
already
mentioned
that
there
was
a
recess
in
the
library,
and
in
this
it
was
my
habit
to
work.
I
settled
down
steadily
to
my
task,
but
my
weariness
overcame
me
and,
falling
back
upon
the
settee,
I
dropped
into
a
heavy
sleep.
How
long
I
slept
I
do
not
know,
but
it
was
quite
dark
when
I
awoke.
Confused
by
the
chlorodyne
which
I
had
taken,
I
lay
motionless
in
a
semi
conscious
state.
The
great
room
with
its
high
walls
covered
with
books
loomed
