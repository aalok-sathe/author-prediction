indicated
a
heartlessness
and
callousness
upon
his
part
which
shocked
many
of
his
friends.
But
in
the
bachelor
circles
of
students
and
artists
in
which
he
preferred
to
move
there
is
no
very
rigid
code
of
honour
in
such
matters,
and
though
a
head
might
be
shaken
or
a
pair
of
shoulders
shrugged
over
the
flight
of
two
and
the
return
of
one,
the
general
sentiment
was
probably
one
of
curiosity
and
perhaps
of
envy
rather
than
of
reprobation.
"Look
here,
Burger,"
said
Kennedy,
looking
hard
at
the
placid
face
of
his
companion,
"I
do
wish
that
you
would
confide
in
me."
As
he
spoke
he
waved
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
a
rug
which
lay
upon
the
floor.
On
the
rug
stood
a
long,
shallow
fruit
basket
of
the
light
wicker
work
which
is
used
in
the
Campagna,
and
this
was
heaped
with
a
litter
of
objects,
inscribed
tiles,
broken
inscriptions,
cracked
mosaics,
torn
papyri,
rusty
metal
ornaments,
which
to
the
uninitiated
might
have
seemed
to
have
come
straight
from
a
dustman's
bin,
but
which
a
specialist
would
have
speedily
recognized
as
unique
of
their
kind.
