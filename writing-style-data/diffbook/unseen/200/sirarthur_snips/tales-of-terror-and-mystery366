business."
A
door
opened
out
of
the
passage
which
was
the
private
entrance
from
his
rooms
into
the
museum.
This
he
opened
softly
with
his
key,
having
first
kicked
off
his
shoes,
an
example
which
I
followed.
We
crept
together
through
room
after
room,
until
the
large
hall
lay
before
us,
with
that
dark
figure
still
stooping
and
working
at
the

case.
With
an

as
cautious
as
his
own
we
closed
in
upon
him,
but
softly

we
went
we
could
not

soldier
suddenly
appear.
Professor
Andreas
saw
him
also,
and
stopped
running,
with
a
gesture
of
despair.
At
the
same
instant
we
each
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder.
"Yes,
yes,
gentlemen,"
he
panted,
"I
will
come
with
you.
To
your
room,
Mr.
Ward
Mortimer,
if
you
please!
I
feel
that
I
owe
you
an
explanation."
My
companion's
indignation
was
so
great
that
