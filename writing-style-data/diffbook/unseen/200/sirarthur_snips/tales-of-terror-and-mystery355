obscure.
However,
there
has
been
no
harm
done,
according
to
Mr.
Purvis."
"I
will
swear
that
those
stones
are
genuine."
"So
that
the
case
appears
to
be
merely
one
of
malicious
damage.
But
none
the
less,
I
should
be
very
glad
to
go
carefully
round
the
premises,
and
to
see
if
we
can
find
any
trace
to
show
us
who
your
visitor
may
have
been."
His
investigation,
which
lasted
all
the
morning,
was
careful
and
intelligent,
but
it
led
in
the
end
to
nothing.
He
pointed
out
to
us
that
there
were
two
possible
entrances
to
the
museum
which
we
had
not
considered.
The
one
was
from
the
cellars
by
a
trap

opening
in
the
passage.
The
other
through
a
skylight
from
the
lumber
room,
overlooking
that
very
chamber
to
which
the
intruder
had
penetrated.
As
neither
the
cellar
nor
the
lumber
room
could
be
entered
unless
the
thief
was
already
within
the
locked
doors,
the
matter
was
not
of
any
practical
importance,
and
the
dust
of
cellar
and
attic
assured
us
that
no
one
had
used
either
one
or
the
other.
Finally,
we
ended
as
we
began,
without
the
slightest
clue
as
to
how,
why,
or
by
