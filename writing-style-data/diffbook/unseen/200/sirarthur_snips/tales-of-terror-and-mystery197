ran
in
this
way:
MY
DEAR
WIFE,
"I
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal,
and
I
find
it
very
hard
to
give
you
up.
The
same
with
Lizzie.
I
try
to
fight
against
it,
but
it
will
always
come
back
to
me.
I
send
you
some
money
which
will
change
into
twenty
English
pounds.
This
should
be
enough
to
bring
both
Lizzie
and
you
across
the
Atlantic,
and
you
will
find
the
Hamburg
boats
which
stop
at
Southampton
very
good
boats,
and
cheaper
than
Liverpool.
If
you
could
come
here
and
stop
at
the
Johnston
House
I
would
try
and
send
you
word
how
to
meet,
but
things
are
very
difficult
with
me
at
present,
and
I
am
not
very
happy,
finding
it
hard
to
give
you
both
up.
So
no
more
at
present,
from
your
loving
husband,
"James
McPherson."
For
a
time
it
was
confidently
anticipated
that
this
letter
would
lead
to
the
clearing
up
of
the
whole
matter,
the
more
so
as
it
was
ascertained
that
a
passenger
who
bore
a
close
resemblance
to
the
missing
guard
had
travelled
from
Southampton
under
the
name
of
Summers
in
the
Hamburg
and
New
York
liner
Vistula,
which
started
upon
the
