of
his
excellent
Matronas.
When
he
had
returned
from
seeing
the
last
of
his
guests
out,
he
drew
a
letter
from
his
dress
jacket
and
sat
down
opposite
to
me.
"This
is
an
anonymous
letter
which
I
received
this
morning,"
said
he.
"I
want
to
read
it
to
you
and
to
have
your
advice."
"You
are
very

to
it
for
what
it
is

was
written
by
one
of
the
limited
number
of
people
who
are
aware
that
you
have
only
one
watchman
at
night."
Ward
Mortimer
handed
me
the
note,
with
a
curious
smile.
"Have
you
an
eye
for
handwriting?"
said
he.
"Now,
look
at
this!"
He
put
another
letter
in
front
of
me.
"Look
at
the
c
in
'congratulate'
and
the
c
in
'committed.'
Look
