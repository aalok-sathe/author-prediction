had
been
under
my
charge,
and
I
remembered
also
the
ingenious
excuses
by
which
this
man
had
made
himself
familiar
with
the
cases
in
which
they
were
kept.
He
was
a
rascal
who
was
planning
some
gigantic
robbery.
How
could
I,
without
striking
my

daughter,
who
was
infatuated

him,
prevent
him
from
carrying
out
any
plan

who
had,
I
believe,
a
real
and
overpowering
affection
for
my
daughter.
As
to
her,
I
could
not
have
believed
that
any
woman
could
be
so
completely
under
the
influence
of
a
man
as
she
was.
His
stronger
nature
seemed
to
entirely
dominate
her.
I
had
not
realized
how

this
was
the
case,
