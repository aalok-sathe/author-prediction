amused
to
learn
that
there
was
one
of
my
agents
in
the
pilot
boat
which
brought
that
steamer
to
its
moorings.
"The
moment
that
Caratal
arrived
in
Liverpool
we
knew
that
he
suspected
danger
and
was
on
his
guard.
He
had
brought
with
him
as
an
escort
a
dangerous
fellow,
named
Gomez,
a
man
who
carried
weapons,
and
was
prepared
to
use
them.
This
fellow
carried
Caratal's
confidential
papers
for
him,
and
was
ready
to
protect
either
them
or
his
master.
The
probability
was
that
Caratal
had
taken
him
into
his
counsel,
and
that
to
remove
Caratal
without
removing
Gomez
would
be
a
mere
waste
of
energy.
It
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
involved
in
a
common
fate,
and
our
plans
to
that
end
were
much
facilitated
by
their
request
for
a
special
train.
On
that
special
train
you
will
understand
that
two
out
of
the
three
servants
of
the
company
were
really
in
our
employ,
at
a
price
which
would
make
them
independent
for
a
lifetime.
I
do
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
English
are
more
honest
than
any
other
nation,
but
I
have
found
them
more
expensive
to
buy.
