the
matter
up,
and
from
being
an
avenger
of
crime
I
found
myself
changed
to
a
conspirator
against
Justice.
The
place
in
which
we
found
ourselves
was
one
of
those
pheasant
preserves
which
are
so
common
in
the
Old
Country,
and
as
we
groped
our
way
through
it
I
found
myself
consulting
the
slayer
of
my
brother
as
to
how
far
it
would
be
possible
to
hush
it
up.
"I
soon
realized
from
what
he
said
that
unless
there
were
some
papers
of
which
we
knew
nothing
in
my
brother's
pockets,
there
was
really
no
possible
means
by
which
the
police
could
identify
him
or
learn
how
he
had
got
there.
His
ticket
was
in
MacCoy's
pocket,
and
so
was
the
ticket
for
some
baggage
which
they
had
left
at
the
depot.
Like
most
Americans,
he
had
found
it
cheaper
and
easier
to
buy
an
outfit
in
London
than
to
bring
one
from
New
York,
so
that
all
his
linen
and
clothes
were
new
and
unmarked.
The
bag,
containing
the
dust
cloak,
which
I
had
thrown
out
of
the
window,
may
have
fallen
among
some
bramble
patch
where
it
is
still
concealed,
or
may
have
been
carried
off
by
some
