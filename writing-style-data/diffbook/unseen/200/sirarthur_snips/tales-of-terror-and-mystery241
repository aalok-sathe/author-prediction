I
stood
motionless
and
staring
until
I
was
aroused
by
a
yell
for
help
from
my
companion.
The
open
door
shed
enough
light
for
me
to
see
the
outline
of
things,
and
there
was
little
Lord
Linchmere
with
his
arms
round
the
neck
of
his
brother
in
law,
holding
bravely
on
to
him
like
a
game
bull
terrier
with
its
teeth
into
a
gaunt
deerhound.
The
tall,
bony
man
dashed
himself
about,
writhing
round
and
round
to
get
a
grip
upon
his
assailant;
but
the
other,
clutching
on
from
behind,
still
kept
his
hold,
though
his
shrill,
frightened
cries
showed
how
unequal
he
felt
the
contest
to
be.
I
sprang
to
the
rescue,
and
the
two
of
us
managed
to
throw
Sir
Thomas
to
the
ground,
though
he
made
his
teeth
meet
in
my
shoulder.
With
all
my
youth
and
weight
and
strength,
it
was
a
desperate
struggle
before
we
could
master
his
frenzied
struggles;
but
at
last
we
secured
his
arms
with
the
waist
cord
of
the
dressing
gown
which
he
was
wearing.
I
was
holding
his
legs
while
Lord
Linchmere
was
endeavouring
to
relight
the
lamp,
when
there
came
the
pattering
of
many
feet
in
the
passage,
and
