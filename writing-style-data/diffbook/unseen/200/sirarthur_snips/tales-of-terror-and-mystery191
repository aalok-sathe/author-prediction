be
disregarded.
Besides
these,
however,
there
are
seven
which
have,
or
have
had,
proper
lines
running
down
and
connecting
with
points
to
the
main
line,
so
as
to
convey
their
produce
from
the
mouth
of
the
mine
to
the
great
centres
of
distribution.
In
every
case
these
lines
are
only
a
few
miles
in
length.
Out
of
the
seven,
four
belong
to
collieries
which
are
worked
out,
or
at
least
to
shafts
which
are
no
longer
used.
These
are
the
Redgauntlet,
Hero,
Slough
of
Despond,
and
Heartsease
mines,
the
latter
having
ten
years
ago
been
one
of
the
principal
mines
in
Lancashire.
These
four
side
lines
may
be
eliminated
from
our
inquiry,
for,
to
prevent
possible
accidents,
the
rails
nearest
to
the
main
line
have
been
taken
up,
and
there
is
no
longer
any
connection.
There
remain
three
other
side
lines
leading
(a)
To
the
Carnstock
Iron
Works;
(b)
To
the
Big
Ben
Colliery;
(c)
To
the
Perseverance
Colliery.
"Of
these
the
Big
Ben
line
is
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long,
and
ends
at
a
dead
wall
of
coal
waiting
removal
from
the
mouth
of
the
mine.
Nothing
had
been
seen
or
heard
there
of
any
