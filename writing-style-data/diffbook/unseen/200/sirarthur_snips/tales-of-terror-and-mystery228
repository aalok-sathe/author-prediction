"I
think
it
would
very
much
better,
sir,
if
you
were
to
trust
me
entirely,"
said
I.
"It
is
impossible
for
me
to
act
effectively,
when
I
do
not
know
what
are
the
objects
which
we
have
in
view,
or
even
where
we
are
going."
"Oh,
as
to
where
we
are
going,
there
need
be
no
mystery
about
that,"
said
he;
"we
are
going
to
Delamere
Court,
the
residence
of
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter,
with
whose
work
you
are
so
conversant.
As
to
the
exact
object
of
our
visit,
I
do
not
know
that
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
anything
would
be
gained,
Dr.
Hamilton,
by
taking
you
into
my
complete
confidence.
I
may
tell
you
that
we
are
acting
I
say
'we,'
because
my
sister,
Lady
Rossiter,
takes
the
same
view
as
myself
with
the
one
object
of
preventing
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
family
scandal.
That
being
so,
you
can
understand
that
I
am
loath
to
give
any
explanations
which
are
not
absolutely
necessary.
It
would
be
a
different
matter,
Dr.
Hamilton,
if
I
were
asking
your
advice.
As
matters
stand,
it
is
only
your
active
help
which
I
need,
and
I
will
indicate
to
you
