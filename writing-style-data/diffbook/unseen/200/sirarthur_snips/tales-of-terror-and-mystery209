the
edge
of
that
cutting.
I
was
there.
And
now
I
will
tell
you
what
I
saw.
"My
assistant
had
remained
at
the
points
in
order
that
he
might
superintend
the
switching
off
of
the
train.
He
had
four
armed
men
with
him,
so
that
if
the
train
ran
off
the
line
we
thought
it
probable,
because
the
points
were
very
rusty
we
might
still
have
resources
to
fall
back
upon.
Having
once
seen
it
safely
on
the
side
line,
he
handed
over
the
responsibility
to
me.
I
was
waiting
at
a
point
which
overlooks
the
mouth
of
the
mine,
and
I
was
also
armed,
as
were
my
two
companions.
Come
what
might,
you
see,
I
was
always
ready.
"The
moment
that
the
train
was
fairly
on
the
side
line,
Smith,
the
stoker,
slowed
down
the
engine,
and
then,
having
turned
it
on
to
the
fullest
speed
again,
he
and
McPherson,
with
my
English
lieutenant,
sprang
off
before
it
was
too
late.
It
may
be
that
it
was
this
slowing
down
which
first
attracted
the
attention
of
the
travellers,
but
the
train
was
running
at
full
speed
again
before
their
heads
appeared
at
the
open
window.
It
makes
me
smile
