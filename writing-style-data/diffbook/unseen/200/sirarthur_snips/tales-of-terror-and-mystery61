spoke
of
his

subject
that
his
face
was
filled
with
life
and
soul.
At
other
times
he
was
silent
and
embarrassed,
too
conscious
of
his
own
limitations
in
larger
subjects,
and
impatient
of
that
small
talk
which
is
the
conventional
refuge
of
those
who
have
no
thoughts
to
express.
And
yet
for
some
years
there
had
been
an
acquaintanceship
which
appeared
to
be
slowly
ripening
into
a
friendship
between
these
two
very
different
rivals.
The
base
and
origin
of
this
lay
in
the
fact
that
in
their
own
studies
each
was
the
only
one
of
the
younger
men
who
had
knowledge
and
enthusiasm
enough
to
properly
appreciate
the
other.
Their
common
interests
and
pursuits
had
brought
them
together,
and
each
had
been
attracted
by
the
other's
knowledge.
And
then
gradually
something
had
been
added
to
this.
Kennedy
had
been
amused
by
the
frankness
and
simplicity
of
his
rival,
while
Burger
in
turn
had
been
fascinated
by
the
brilliancy
and
vivacity
which
had
made
Kennedy
such
a
favourite
in
Roman
society.
I
say
"had,"
because
just
at
the
moment
the
young
Englishman
was
somewhat
under
a
cloud.
A
love
affair,
the
