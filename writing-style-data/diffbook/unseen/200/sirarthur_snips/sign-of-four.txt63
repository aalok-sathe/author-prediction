and
this
time
it
gave
way
with
a
sudden
snap,
and
we
found
ourselves
within
Bartholomew
Sholto's
chamber.
It
appeared
to
have
been
fitted
up
as
a
chemical
laboratory.
A
double
line
of
glass
stoppered
bottles
was
drawn
up
upon
the
wall
opposite
the
door,
and
the
table
was
littered
over
with
Bunsen
burners,
test
tubes,
and
retorts.
In
the
corners
stood
carboys
of
acid
in
wicker
baskets.
One
of
these
appeared
to
leak
or
to

and
plaster,
and
above
them

in
the
ceiling
large
enough
for
a
man
to
pass
through.
At
the
foot
of
the
steps
a
long
coil
of
rope
was
thrown
carelessly
together.
By
the
table,
in
a
wooden
arm
chair,
the
master
of
the
house
was
seated
all
in
a
heap,
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
left
shoulder,
and
that
ghastly,
inscrutable
smile
upon
his
face.
He
was
stiff
and
cold,
and
