by
another
witness
that
the
prisoner
was
aware
that
the
doctor
was
in
the
habit
of
sitting
up
alone
in
this
isolated
wing
of
the
house,
and
that
he
had
chosen
this
very
late
hour
to
call
because
he
knew
that
his
victim
would
then
be
at
his
mercy.
A
servant
at
the
squire's
house
was
compelled
to
admit
that
he
had
heard
his
master
return
about
three
that
morning,
which
corroborated
Mrs.
Madding's
statement
that
she
had
seen
him
among
the
laurel
bushes
near
the
gate
upon
the
occasion
of
her
second
visit.
The
muddy
boots
and
an
alleged
similarity
in
the
footprints
were
duly
dwelt
upon,
and
it
was
felt
when
the
case
for
the
prosecution
had
been
presented
that,
however
circumstantial
it
might
be,
it
was
none
the
less
so
complete
and
so
convincing,
that
the
fate
of
the
prisoner
was
sealed,
unless
something
quite
unexpected
should
be
disclosed
by
the
defence.
It
was
three
o'clock
when
the
prosecution
closed.
At
half
past
four,
when
the
court
rose,
a
new
and
unlooked
for
development
had
occurred.
I
extract
the
incident,
or
part
of
it,
from
the
journal
which
I
have
already
mentioned,
omitting
the
preliminary
observations
of
