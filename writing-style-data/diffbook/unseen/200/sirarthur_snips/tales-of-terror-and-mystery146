was
specially
prepared
upon
his
own
plantation,
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
my
driver's
eulogies
were
justified,
and
that
I
had
never
met
a
more
large
hearted
and
hospitable
man.
But,
in
spite
of
his
cheery
good
nature,
he
was
a
man
with
a
strong
will
and
a
fiery
temper
of

I
had
an
example
upon
the
following
morning.
The

Mrs.
Everard
King
had
conceived
towards
me
was
so
strong,
that
her
manner
at

"Oh,

her
eyes.
"I
am

I
answered,
"that
Mr.
Everard
King
would
tell
me
if
I
were
outstaying
my
welcome."
"What's
this?

said
a
voice,
and
