hypothesis
were
correct,
and
someone
was
with
Dr.
Lana
before
Mrs.
Madding
met
Mr.
Arthur
Morton,
then
who
was
this
someone,
and
what
motives
had
he
for
wishing
evil
to
the
doctor?
It
was
universally
admitted
that
if
the
friends
of
the
accused
could
throw
light
upon
this,
they
would
have
gone
a
long
way
towards
establishing
his
innocence.
But
in
the
meanwhile
it
was
open
to
the
public
to
say
as
they
did
say
that
there
was
no
proof
that
anyone
had
been
there
at

on

proof
that
his
motives
in
going
were
of
a
sinister
kind.
When
Mrs.

called,
the
doctor
might
have
retired
to

as
she
thought
at
the
time,
have
gone
out
and
returned
afterwards
to
find
Mr.
Arthur
Morton
waiting
for
him.
Some
of
the
supporters
of
the
accused
laid
stress
upon
the
fact
that
the
photograph
of
his
sister
Frances,
which
had
been
removed
from
the
doctor's
room,
had
not
been
found
in
her
brother's
possession.
This
argument,
however,
did
not
count
for
much,
as
he
had
ample
time
before
his
arrest
