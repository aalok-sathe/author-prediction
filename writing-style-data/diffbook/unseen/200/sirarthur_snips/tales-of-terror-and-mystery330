Humphrey
was
observed
to
enter
in
a
state
of
emotion,
which
even
his
trained
nerves
could
not
conceal,
and
to
confer
with
the
opposing
counsel.
A
few
hurried
words
words
which
left
a
look
of
amazement
upon
Mr.
Porlock
Carr's
face
passed
between
them,
and
then
the
counsel
for
the
defence,
addressing
the
Judge,
announced
that,
with
the
consent
of
the
prosecution,
the
young
lady
who
had
given
evidence
upon
the
sitting
before
would
not
be
recalled.
The
Judge:
But
you
appear,
Mr.
Humphrey,
to
have
left
matters
in
a
very
unsatisfactory
state.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Perhaps,
my
lord,
my
next
witness
may
help
to
clear
them
up.
The
Judge:
Then
call
your
next
witness.
Mr.
Humphrey:
I
call
Dr.
Aloysius
Lana.
The
learned
counsel
has
made
many
telling
remarks
in
his
day,
but
he
has
certainly
never
produced
such
a
sensation
with
so
short
a
sentence.
The
court
was
simply
stunned
with
amazement
as
the
very
man
whose
fate
had
been
the
subject
of
so
much
contention
appeared
bodily
before
them
in
the
witness
box.
Those
among
the
spectators
who
had
known
him
at
Bishop's
Crossing
saw
him
now,
gaunt
and
thin,
with
deep
lines
of
care
upon
his
face.
