all
this
explanation,
if
you
could
do
it
for
me.
You
remember
that
Testament
that
was
picked
up.
I
always
carried
it
in
my
inside
pocket,
and
it
must
have
come
out
in
my
fall.
I
value
it
very
highly,
for
it
was
the
family
book
with
my
birth
and
my
brother's
marked
by
my
father
in
the
beginning
of
it.
I
wish
you
would
apply
at
the
proper
place
and
have
it
sent
to
me.
It
can
be
of
no
possible
value
to
anyone
else.
If
you
address
it
to
X,
Bassano's
Library,
Broadway,
New
York,
it
is
sure
to
come
to
hand."
The
Japanned
Box
It
WAS
a
curious
thing,
said
the
private
tutor;
one
of
those
grotesque
and
whimsical
incidents
which
occur
to
one
as
one
goes
through
life.
I
lost
the
best
situation
which
I
am
ever
likely
to
have
through
it.
But
I
am
glad
that
I
went
to
Thorpe
Place,
for
I
gained
well,
as
I
tell
you
the
story
you
will
learn
what
I
gained.
I
don't
know
whether
you
are
familiar
with
that
part
of
the
Midlands
which
is
drained
by
the
Avon.
It
is
the
most
English
part
of
England.
