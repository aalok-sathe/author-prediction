I
had
waited,
now
that
it
had
actually
come
I
was
unprepared
for
the
shock.
I
lay
motionless
and
breathless,
whilst
the
great
dark
mass
whisked
by
me
and
was
swallowed
up
in
the
night.
But
now
I
nerved
myself
for
its
return.
No
sound
came
from
the
sleeping
countryside
to
tell
of
the
horror
which
was
loose.
In
no
way
could
I
judge
how
far
off
it
was,
what
it
was
doing,
or
when
it
might
be
back.
But
not
a
second
time
should
my
nerve
fail
me,
not
a
second
time
should
it
pass
unchallenged.
I
swore
it
between
my
clenched
teeth
as
I
laid
my
cocked
rifle
across
the
rock.
And
yet
it
nearly
happened.
There
was
no
warning
of
approach
now
as
the
creature
passed
over
the
grass.
Suddenly,
like
a
dark,
drifting
shadow,
the
huge
bulk
loomed
up
once
more
before
me,
making
for
the
entrance
of
the
cave.
Again
came
that
paralysis
of
volition
which
held
my
crooked
forefinger
impotent
upon
the
trigger.
But
with
a
desperate
effort
I
shook
it
off.
Even
as
the
brushwood
rustled,
and
the
monstrous
beast
blended
with
the
shadow
of
the
Gap,
I
fired
at
the
retreating
form.
