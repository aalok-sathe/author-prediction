duties
were
to
choose
my
subordinates,
to
use
freely
the
power
which
money
gives,
and
to
make
certain
that
Monsieur
Caratal
should
never
arrive
in
Paris.
With
characteristic
energy
I
set
about
my
commission
within
an
hour
of
receiving
my
instructions,
and
the
steps
which
I
took
were
the
very
best
for
the
purpose
which
could
possibly
be
devised.
"A
man
whom
I
could
trust
was
dispatched
instantly
to
South
America
to
travel
home
with
Monsieur

prepared
for

series
of
alternatives
prepared,
one
or
the
other
of
which
must
succeed.
You
must
not
underrate
the
difficulties
of
my
undertaking,
or
imagine
that
a
mere
commonplace
assassination
would
meet
the
case.
We
must
destroy
not
only
Monsieur
Caratal,
but
Monsieur
Caratal's
documents,
and
Monsieur
Caratal's
companions
also,
if
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
communicated
his
secrets
to
them.
And
you
must
remember
that
they
