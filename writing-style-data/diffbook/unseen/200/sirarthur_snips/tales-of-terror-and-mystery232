he.
"It
is
a
rare
thing
for
me
to
meet
anyone
who
takes
an
intelligent
interest
in
such
matters.
People
can
find
time
for
such
trivialities
as
sport
or
society,
and
yet
the
beetles
are
overlooked.
I
can
assure
you
that
the
greater
part
of
the
idiots
in
this
part
of
the
country
are
unaware
that
I
have
ever
written
a
book
at
all
I,
the
first
man
who
ever
described
the
true
function
of
the
elytra.
I
am
glad
to
see
you,
sir,
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
I
can
show
you
some
specimens
which
will
interest
you."
He
stepped
into
the
fly
and
drove
up
with
us
to
the
house,
expounding
to
me
as
we
went
some
recent
researches
which
he
had
made
into
the
anatomy
of
the
lady
bird.
I
have
said
that
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter
wore
a
large
hat
drawn
down
over
his
brows.
As
he
entered
the
hall
he
uncovered
himself,
and
I
was
at
once
aware
of
a
singular
characteristic
which
the
hat
had
concealed.
His
forehead,
which
was
naturally
high,
and
higher
still
on
account
of
receding
hair,
was
in
a
continual
state
of
movement.
Some
nervous
weakness
kept
the
muscles
in
