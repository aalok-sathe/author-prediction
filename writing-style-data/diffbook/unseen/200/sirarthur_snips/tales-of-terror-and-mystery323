there
was
not
one
which
prepared
the
minds
of
the
public
for
the
extraordinary
sequel,
which
caused
so
much
excitement
upon
the
first
day
of
the
trial,
and
came
to
a
climax
upon
the
second.
The
long
files
of
the
Lancaster
Weekly
with
their
report
of
the
case
lie
before
me
as
I
write,
but
I
must
content
myself
with
a
synopsis
of
the
case
up

point
when,
upon
the
evening
of
the
first
day,
the
evidence
of
Miss
Frances
Morton
threw
a
singular
light

the

Mr.
Porlock
Carr,
the
counsel
for

skill,
and
as

was
the
task
which
Mr.
Humphrey,
who
had
been
retained
for
the
defence,
had
before
him.
Several
witnesses
were
put
up
to
swear
to
the
intemperate
expressions
which
the
young
squire
had
been
heard
to
utter
about
the
doctor,
and
the
fiery
manner
in
which
he
resented
the
alleged
ill
treatment
of
his
sister.
Mrs.
Madding
repeated
her
evidence
as
to
the
visit
which
had
been
paid
late
at
night
by
the
prisoner
to
the
deceased,
and
it
was
