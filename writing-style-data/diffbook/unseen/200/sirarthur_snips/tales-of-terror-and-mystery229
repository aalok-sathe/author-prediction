how
you
can
best
give
it."
There
was
nothing
more
to
be
said,
and
a
poor
man
can
put
up
with
a
good
deal
for
twenty
pounds
a
day,
but
I
felt
none
the
less
that
Lord
Linchmere
was
acting
rather
scurvily
towards
me.
He
wished
to
convert

the
time,
and
he
never
opened
his
mouth
until
we
were
close

our
destination.
When
he
did

"Perhaps

"No,
