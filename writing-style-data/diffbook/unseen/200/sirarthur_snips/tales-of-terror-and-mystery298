I
cannot
help
it,
but
can
only
assure
you
that,
improbable
as
it
may
appear,
the
matter
came
about
exactly
as
I
describe
it.
The
first
stage
in
this
denouement
was
that
the
small
room
in
the
turret
became
uninhabitable.
This
occurred
through
the
fall
of
the
worm
eaten
oaken
beam
which
supported
the
ceiling.
Rotten
with
age,
it
snapped
in
the

one
morning,
and
brought
down
a
quantity
of
plaster
with

was
rescued
from
amongst
the
debris

brought
into
the

his
bureau.
Sir
John
took
no
steps

an
opportunity
of
searching
for
that
secret

the
existence
of
which
I
had
surmised.
As
to
the
lady,
I
had
thought
that
this
would
have
brought
her
visits
to
an
end,
had
I
not
one
evening
heard
Mr.
Richards
asking
Mrs.
Stevens
who
the
woman
was
whom
he
had
overheard
talking
to
Sir
John
in
the
library.
I
could
not
catch
her
reply,
but
I
saw
from
her
manner
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
