the
author
of
the
mischief,
but
what
it
was
exactly
which
he
had
done
could
never
be
clearly
formulated
in
words.
Amongst
the
many
suggestions
put
forward
by
various
newspapers
or
private
individuals,
there
were
one
or
two
which
were
feasible
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
public.
One
which
appeared
in
The
Times,
over
the
signature
of
an
amateur
reasoner
of
some
celebrity
at
that
date,
attempted
to
deal
with
the
matter
in
a
critical
and
semi
scientific
manner.
An
extract
must
suffice,
although
the
curious
can
see
the
whole
letter
in
the
issue
of
the

of
July.
"It
is
one
of
the
elementary
principles
of
practical
reasoning,"
he
remarked,
"that
when
the
impossible
has
been
eliminated
the
residuum,
HOWEVER
IMPROBABLE,
must
contain
the
truth.
It
is
certain
that
the
train
left
Kenyon
Junction.
It
is
certain
that
it
did
not
reach
Barton
Moss.
It
is
in
the
highest
degree
unlikely,
but
still
possible,
that
it
may
have
taken
one
of
the
seven
available
side
lines.
It
is
obviously
impossible
for
a
train
to
run
where
there
are
no
rails,
and,
therefore,
we
may
reduce
our
improbables
to
the
three
open
lines,
