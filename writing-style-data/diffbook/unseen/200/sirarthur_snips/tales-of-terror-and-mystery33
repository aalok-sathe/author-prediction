On
the

page
is
written,
in
large,
straggling
writing:
"Forty
three
thousand
feet.
I
shall
never
see
earth
again.
They
are
beneath
me,
three
of
them.
God
help
me;
it
is
a
dreadful
death
to
die!"
Such

the

Statement.
Of
the
man
nothing
has
since
been
seen.
Pieces
of
his
shattered
monoplane
have
been
picked
up
in
the
preserves
of
Mr.

Lushington

monoplane,
but
had
been
overtaken
and
devoured
by
these
horrible
creatures
at
some
spot
in
the
outer
atmosphere
above
the
place
where
the
grim
relics
were
found.
The
picture
of
that
monoplane
skimming
down
the
sky,
with
the
nameless
terrors
flying
as
swiftly
beneath
it
and
cutting
it
off
always

the
earth
