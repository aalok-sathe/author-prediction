The
two
officials
stared
at
each
other
in
amazement.
"This
is
unique
in
my
thirty
years
of
experience,"
said
Mr.
Bland.
"Absolutely
unprecedented
and
inexplicable,
sir.
The
special
has
gone
wrong
between
Kenyon
Junction
and
Barton
Moss."
"And
yet
there
is
no
siding,
so
far
as
my
memory
serves
me,
between
the
two
stations.
The
special
must
have
run
off
the
metals."
"But
how
could
the
four
fifty
parliamentary
pass
over
the
same
line
without
observing
it?"
"There's
no
alternative,
Mr.
Hood.
It
must
be
so.
Possibly
the
local
train
may
have
observed
something
which
may
throw
some
light
upon
the
matter.
We
will
wire
to
Manchester
for
more
information,
and
to
Kenyon
Junction
with
instructions
that
the
line
be
examined
instantly
as
far
as
Barton
Moss."
The
answer
from
Manchester
came
within
a
few
minutes.
"No
