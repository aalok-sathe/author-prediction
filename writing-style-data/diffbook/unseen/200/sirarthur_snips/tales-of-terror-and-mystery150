a
tiger,
but
as
black
and
sleek
as
ebony.
It
was
simply
a
very
enormous
and
very
well
kept
black
cat,
and
it
cuddled
up
and
basked
in
that
yellow
pool
of
light
exactly
as
a
cat
would
do.
It
was
so
graceful,
so
sinewy,
and
so
gently
and
smoothly
diabolical,
that
I
could
not
take
my
eyes
from
the
opening.
"Isn't
he
splendid?"
said
my
host,
enthusiastically.
"Glorious!
I
never
saw
such
a
noble
creature."
"Some
people
call
it
a
black
puma,
but
really
it
is
not
a
puma
at
all.
That
fellow
is
nearly
eleven
feet
from
tail
to
tip.
Four
years
ago
he
was
a
little
ball
of
black
fluff,
with
two
yellow
eyes
staring
out
of
it.
He
was
sold
me
as
a
new
born
cub
up
in
the
wild
country
at
the
head
waters
of
the
Rio
Negro.
They
speared
his
mother
to
death
after
she
had
killed
a
dozen
of
them."
"They
are
ferocious,
then?"
"The
most
absolutely
treacherous
and
bloodthirsty
creatures
upon
earth.
You
talk
about
a
Brazilian
cat
to
an
up
country
Indian,
and
see
him
get
the
jumps.
They
prefer
humans
to
game.
This
fellow
has
never
tasted
living
blood
yet,
