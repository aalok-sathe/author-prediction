rubbish
found
in
a
cupboard
in
an
ancient
house
at
the
back
of
the
Rue
Mathurin,
in
the
Quartier
Latin.
The
dining
room
of
this
old
house
is
decorated
with
a
coat
of
arms,
chevrons,
and
bars
rouge
upon
a
field
argent,
which
prove,
upon
inquiry,
to
be
the
shield
of
Nicholas
de
la
Reynie,
a
high
official
of
King
Louis
XIV.
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
other
articles
in
the
cupboard
date
back
to
the
early
days
of
that
king.
The
inference
is,
therefore,
that
they
were
all
the
property
of
this
Nicholas
de
la
Reynie,
who
was,
as
I
understand,
the
gentleman
specially
concerned
with
the
maintenance
and
execution
of
the
Draconic
laws
of
that
epoch."
"What
then?"
"I
would
ask
you
now
to
take
the
funnel
into
your
hands
once
more
and
to
examine
the
upper
brass
rim.
Can
you
make
out
any
lettering
upon
it?"
There
were
certainly
some
scratches
upon
it,
almost
obliterated
by
time.
The
general
effect
was
of
several
letters,
the
last
of
which
bore
some
resemblance
to
a
B.
"You
make
it
a
B?"
"Yes,
I
do."
"So
do
I.
In
fact,
I
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
it
is
