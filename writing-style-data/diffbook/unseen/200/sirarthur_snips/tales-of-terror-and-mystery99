Stone
took
it
down,
and
picking
his
way
among
the
lumber,
walked
over
to
a
couch
in
the
corner,
on
which
lay
a
woman
dressed
in
the
Turkish
fashion,
with
yashmak
and
veil.
The
lower
part
of
the
face
was
exposed,
and
the
surgeon
saw
a
jagged
cut
which
zigzagged

the
Turk.

is
absolutely
necessary.
Only
the
knife
can
save

"And
yet
I
am
inclined

the
Turk
cried,
angrily.
"Every
