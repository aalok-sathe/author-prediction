faces
had
told
him
the
rest.
In
an
instant
his
chubby,
cheery
face
set
into
an
expression
of
absolute
ferocity.
"Might
I
trouble
you
to
walk
outside,
Marshall?"
said
he.
(I
may
mention
that
my
own
name
is
Marshall
King.)
He
closed
the
door
behind
me,
and
then,
for
an
instant,
I
heard
him
talking
in
a
low
voice
of
concentrated
passion
to
his
wife.
This
gross
breach
of
hospitality
had
evidently
hit
upon
his
tenderest
point.
I
am
no
eavesdropper,
so
I
walked
out
on
to
the
lawn.
Presently
I
heard
a
hurried
step
behind
me,
and
there
was
the
lady,
her
face
pale
with
excitement,
and
her
eyes
red
with
tears.
"My
husband
has
asked
me
to
apologize
to
you,
Mr.
Marshall
King,"
said
she,
standing
with
downcast
eyes
before
me.
"Please
do
not
say
another
word,
Mrs.
King."
Her
dark
eyes
suddenly
blazed
out
at
me.
"You
fool!"
she
hissed,
with
frantic
vehemence,
and
turning
on
her
heel
swept
back
to
the
house.
The
insult
was
so
outrageous,
so
insufferable,
that
I
could
only
stand
staring
after
her
in
bewilderment.
I
was
still
there
when
my
host
joined
me.
He
was
his
cheery,
chubby
self
once
more.
