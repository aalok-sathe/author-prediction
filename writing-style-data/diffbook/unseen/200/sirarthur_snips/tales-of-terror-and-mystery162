everything
was
silent.
The
creature
had
never
moved
during
this
time.
He
lay
still
in
the
corner,
and
his
tail
had
ceased
switching.
This
apparition
of
a
man
adhering
to
his
bars
and
dragged
screaming
across
him
had
apparently
filled
him
with
amazement.
I
saw
his
great
eyes
staring
steadily
at
me.
I
had
dropped
the
lantern
when
I
seized
the
bars,
but
it
still
burned
upon
the
floor,
and
I
made
a
movement
to
grasp
it,
with
some
idea
that
its
light
might
protect
me.
But
the
instant
I
moved,
the
beast
gave
a
deep
and
menacing
growl.
I
stopped
and
stood
still,
quivering
with
fear
in
every
limb.
The
cat
(if
one
may
call
so
fearful
a
creature
by
so
homely
a
name)
was
not
more
than
ten
feet
from
me.
The
eyes
glimmered
like
two
disks
of
phosphorus
in
the
darkness.
They
appalled
and
yet
fascinated
me.
I
could
not
take
my
own
eyes
from
them.
Nature
plays
strange
tricks
with
us
at
such
moments
of
intensity,
and
those
glimmering
lights
waxed
and
waned
with
a
steady
rise
and
fall.
Sometimes
they
seemed
to
be
tiny
points
of
extreme
brilliancy
little
electric
sparks
in
the
black
obscurity
