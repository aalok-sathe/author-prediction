all
the
same,
for
he
had
such
a
way
with
him
that
you
could
refuse
him
nothing.
I
did
all
I
could
to
hold
him
in,
and
he
hated
me
for
my
pains.
"At
last
he
fairly
got
his
head,
and
nothing
that
we
could
do
would
stop
him.
He
got
off
into
New
York,
and
went
rapidly
from
bad
to
worse.
At
first
he
was
only
fast,
and
then
he
was
criminal;
and
then,
at
the
end
of
a
year
or
two,
he
was
one
of
the
most
notorious
young
crooks
in
the
city.
He
had
formed
a
friendship
with
Sparrow
MacCoy,
who
was
at
the
head
of
his
profession
as
a
bunco
steerer,
green
goodsman
and
general
rascal.
They
took
to
card
sharping,
and
frequented
some
of
the
best
hotels
in
New
York.
My
brother
was
an
excellent
actor
(he
might
have
made
an
honest
name
for
himself
if
he
had
chosen),
and
he
would
take
the
parts
of
a
young
Englishman
of
title,
of
a
simple
lad
from
the
West,
or
of
a
college
undergraduate,
whichever
suited
Sparrow
MacCoy's
purpose.
And
then
one
day
he
dressed
himself
as
a
girl,
and
he
carried
it
off
so
well,
