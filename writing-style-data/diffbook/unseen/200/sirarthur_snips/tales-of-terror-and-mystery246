Lady
Rossiter

my
association

Sir

I

The
Man
with
the
Watches
There
are
many
who
will
still
bear
in
mind
the
singular
circumstances
which,
under
the
heading
of
the
Rugby
Mystery,
filled
many

the
tragic

is
most
stimulating
to
the
popular
imagination.
Interest
drooped,
however,
when,
after
weeks
of
fruitless
investigation,
it
was
found
that
no
final
explanation
of
the
facts
was
forthcoming,
and
the
tragedy
seemed
from
that
time
to
the
present
to
have
finally
taken
its
place
in
the
dark
catalogue
of
inexplicable
and
unexpiated
crimes.
