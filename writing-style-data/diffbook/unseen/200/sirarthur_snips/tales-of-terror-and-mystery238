Lord
Linchmere
was
suffering
from
some
singular
delusion,
and
the
result
was
that
on
an
imbecile
pretext
I
was
to
be
deprived
of
my
night's
rest.
Still,
however
absurd,
I
was
determined
to
carry
out
his
injunctions
to
the
letter
as
long
as
I
was
in
his
employment.
I
sat,
therefore,
beside
the
empty
fireplace,
and
listened
to
a
sonorous
chiming
clock
somewhere
down
the
passage
which
gurgled
and
struck
every
quarter
of
an
hour.
It
was
an
endless
vigil.
Save
for
that
single
clock,
an
absolute
silence
reigned
throughout
the
great
house.
A
small
lamp
stood
on
the
table
at
my
elbow,
throwing
a
circle
of
light
round
my
chair,
but
leaving
the
corners
of
the
room
draped
in
shadow.
On
the
bed
Lord
Linchmere
was
breathing
peacefully.
I
envied
him
his
quiet
sleep,
and
again
and
again
my
own
eyelids
drooped,
but
every
time
my
sense
of
duty
came
to
my
help,
and
I
sat
up,
rubbing
my
eyes
and
pinching
myself
with
a
determination
to
see
my
irrational
watch
to
an
end.
And
I
did
so.
From
down
the
passage
came
the
chimes
of
two
o'clock,
and
I
laid
my
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
sleeper.
