to
think
how
bewildered
they
must
have
been.
Picture
to
yourself
your
own
feelings
if,
on
looking
out
of
your
luxurious
carriage,
you
suddenly
perceived
that
the
lines
upon
which
you
ran
were
rusted
and
corroded,
red
and
yellow
with
disuse
and
decay!
What
a
catch
must
have
come
in
their
breath
as
in
a
second
it
flashed
upon
them
that
it
was
not
Manchester
but
Death
which
was
waiting
for

who
smells
the
blood
of
the
slaughter
house.
He
saw
us
standing
on
the
bank,
and
he
beckoned
to
us
like
a
madman.
Then
he
tore
at
his
wrist
and
threw
his
dispatch
box
out
of
the
window
in
our
direction.
Of
course,
his
meaning
was
obvious.
Here
was
the
evidence,
and
they
would
promise
to
be
silent
if
their
lives
