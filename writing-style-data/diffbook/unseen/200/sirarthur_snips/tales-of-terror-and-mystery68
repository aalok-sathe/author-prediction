matter
which
was
the
common
talk
of
Rome,
so
that
you
are
not
really
doing
Miss
Mary
Saunderson
any
injury
by
discussing
her
case
with
me.
But
still,
I
respect
your
scruples;
and
so
good
night!"
"Wait
a
bit,
Burger,"
said
Kennedy,
laying
his
hand
upon
the
other's
arm;
"I
am
very
keen
upon
this
catacomb
business,
and
I
can't

before
his
host
sprang
up
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
making
the
best
of
that
which
cannot
be
helped.
"Hold
on,
old
fellow,"
said
he;
"I
think
you
are
behaving
in
a
most
ridiculous
fashion;
but
still;
if
this
is
your
condition,
I
suppose
that
I
must
submit
