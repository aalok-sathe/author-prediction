could
always
say
at
any
hour
exactly
where
he
would
be.
Twice
in
the
day
he
would
visit
his
study,
once
after
breakfast,
and
once
about
ten
at
night.
You
might
set
your
watch
by
the
slam
of
the
heavy
door.
For
the
rest
of
the
day
he
would
be
in
his
library
save
that
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
afternoon
he
would
take
a
walk
or
a
ride,
which
was
solitary
like
the
rest
of
his
existence.
He
loved
his
children,
and
was
keenly
interested
in
the
progress
of
their
studies,
but
they
were
a
little
awed
by
the
silent,
shaggy
browed
figure,
and
they
avoided
him
as
much
as
they
could.
Indeed,
we
all
did
that.
It
was
some
time
before
I
came
to
know
anything
about
the
circumstances
of
Sir
John
Bollamore's
life,
for
Mrs.
Stevens,
the
housekeeper,
and
Mr.
Richards,
the
land
steward,
were
too
loyal
to
talk
easily
of
their
employer's
affairs.
As
to
the
governess,
she
knew
no
more
than
I
did,
and
our
common
interest
was
one
of
the
causes
which
drew
us
together.
At
last,
however,
an
incident
occurred
which
led
to
a
closer
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Richards
and
a
