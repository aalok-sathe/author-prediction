subtlety,
but
the
smile
was
so
honest,
and
the
eyes
so
frank,
that
one
understood
that
this
was
only
an
indication
of
his
ancestry,
with
no
actual
bearing
upon
his
character.
In
age
and
in
reputation,
he
was
on
the
same
level
as
his
English
companion,
but
his
life
and
his
work
had
both
been
far
more
arduous.
Twelve
years
before,
he
had
come
as
a
poor
student
to
Rome,
and
had
lived
ever
since
upon
some
small
endowment
for
research
which
had
been
awarded
to
him
by
the
University
of
Bonn.
Painfully,

and
doggedly,
with
extraordinary
tenacity

he
had
climbed
from

fame,
until
now
he
was
a
member
of
the
Berlin
Academy,
and
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
shortly
be
promoted
to
the
Chair
of
the
greatest
of
German
Universities.
But
the
singleness
of
purpose
which
had
brought
him
to
the
same
high
level
as
the
rich
and
brilliant
Englishman,
had
caused
him
in
everything
outside
their
work
to
stand
infinitely
below
him.
He
had
never
found
a
pause
in
his
studies
in
which
to
cultivate
the
social
graces.
It
was
