"I
hope
that
my
wife
has
apologized
for
her
foolish
remarks,"
said
he.
"Oh,
yes
yes,
certainly!"
He
put
his
hand
through
my
arm
and
walked
with
me
up
and
down
the
lawn.
"You
must
not
take
it
seriously,"
said
he.
"It
would
grieve
me
inexpressibly
if
you
curtailed
your
visit
by
one
hour.
The
fact
is
there
is
no
reason
why
there
should

are,

think
no
more
of
it."
"No,
no;
certainly
not."
"Then
light
this
cigar
and
come
round
with
me
and
see
my
little
menagerie."
The
whole
afternoon
was
occupied
by
this
inspection,
which
included
all
the
birds,
beasts,
and
even
reptiles
which
he
had
imported.
Some
were
free,
some
in
cages,
a
few
actually
in
the
house.
He
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
his
successes
and
his
failures,
his
births
and
