a
glass
of
rich
port
upon
the
malachite
table
at
his
elbow.
As
he
raised
it
to
his
lips,
he
held
it
up
against
the
lamplight,
and
watched
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
the
tiny
scales
of
beeswing
which
floated
in
its
rich
ruby
depths.
The
fire,
as
it
spurted
up,
threw
fitful
lights
upon
his
bald,
clear
cut
face,
with
its
widely
opened
grey
eyes,

thick
and

had
performed
an

that
day

which
only
two
cases
were
on
record,
and
the
result
had
been
brilliant
beyond
all
expectation.
No
other
man
in
London
would
have
had
the
daring
to
plan,
or
the
skill
to
execute,
such
a
heroic
measure.
But
he
had
promised
Lady
Sannox
to
see
her
that
evening
and
it
was
already
half
past
eight.
His
hand
was
outstretched
to
the
bell
to
order
the
carriage
when
he
heard
the
dull
thud
of
