Armitage.
That
they
could
have
wandered
away
of
their
own
accord
and
disappeared
among
the
mountains
was
an
explanation
to
which
he
would
not
listen.
On
one
occasion
a
pool
of
blood
had
been
found,
and
some
tufts
of
wool.
That
also,
I
pointed
out,
could
be
explained
in
a
perfectly
natural
way.
Further,
the
nights
upon
which
sheep
disappeared
were
invariably
very
dark,
cloudy
nights
with
no
moon.
This
I
met
with
the
obvious
retort
that
those
were
the
nights
which
a
commonplace
sheep
stealer
would
naturally
choose
for
his
work.
On
one
occasion
a
gap
had
been
made
in
a
wall,
and
some
of
the
stones
scattered
for
a
considerable
distance.
Human
agency
again,
in
my
opinion.
Finally,
Armitage
clinched
all
his
arguments
by
telling
me
that
he
had
actually
heard
the
Creature
indeed,
that
anyone
could
hear
it
who
remained
long
enough
at
the
Gap.
It
was
a
distant
roaring
of
an
immense
volume.
I
could
not
but
smile
at
this,
knowing,
as
I
do,
the
strange
reverberations
which
come
out
of
an
underground
water
system
running
amid
the
chasms
of
a
limestone
formation.
My
incredulity
annoyed
Armitage
so
that
he
turned
and
left
me
with
some
