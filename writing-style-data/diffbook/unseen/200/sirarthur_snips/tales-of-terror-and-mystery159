We
passed
quietly
down
the
lamp
lit
Persian
rugged
hall,
and
through
the
door
at
the
farther
end.
All
was
dark
in
the
stone
corridor,
but
a
stable
lantern
hung
on
a
hook,
and
my
host
took
it
down
and
lit
it.
There
was
no
grating

him.
"What

black
devil
he
looks,
doesn't

I
must
give
him
a
little
supper
to
put
him
in
a
better
humour.
Would
you
mind
holding
the
lantern
for
a
moment?"
I
took
it
from
his
hand
and
he
stepped
to
the
door.
