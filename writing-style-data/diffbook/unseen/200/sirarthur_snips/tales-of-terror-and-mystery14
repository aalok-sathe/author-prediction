We
can
at
last
control
our
engines
by

How
they
squeal
and
squeak
and
sob
when
they
are
in
trouble!
All
those
cries
for
help
were
wasted
in
the
old
days,
when

folds
of
vapours
were
swirling

my
face.
It
was
clammily
cold
and
miserable.
But
I
was
above
the
hail
storm,
and
that

The
cloud
was
as
dark
and
thick
