pale,
but
serene.
It
was
a
curious
face,
comely
and
yet
feline,
with
a
subtle
suggestion
of
cruelty
about
the
straight,
strong
little
mouth
and
chubby
jaw.
She
was
draped
in
some
sort
of
loose,
white
gown.
Beside
her
stood
a
thin,
eager
priest,
who
whispered
in
her
ear,
and
continually
raised
a
crucifix
before
her
eyes.
She
turned
her
head
and
looked
fixedly

crucifix
at
the
three
men

removed
first
the
red
carpet,
and
then
the
boards
which
formed
the
dais,
so
as
to
entirely
clear
the
room.
When
this
screen
was
removed
I
saw
some
singular
articles
of
furniture
behind
it.
One
looked
like
a
bed
with
wooden
rollers
at
each
end,
and
a
winch
handle
to
regulate
its
length.
Another
was
a
wooden
