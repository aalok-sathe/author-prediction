later
a
third,
more
bewildering
"Presume
some
mistake
as
to
proposed
running
of
special.
Local
train
from
St.
Helens
timed
to
follow
it
has
just
arrived
and
has
seen
nothing
of
it.
Kindly
wire
advices.
Manchester."
The
matter
was
assuming
a
most
amazing
aspect,
although
in
some
respects
the
last
telegram
was
a
relief
to
the
authorities
at
Liverpool.
If
an
accident
had
occurred
to
the
special,
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
the
local
train
could
have
passed
down
the
same
line
without
observing
it.
And
yet,
what
was
the
alternative?
Where
could
the
train
be?
Had
it
possibly
been
sidetracked
for
some
reason
in
order
to
allow
the
slower
train
to
go
past?
Such
an
explanation
was
possible
if
some
small
repair
had
to
be
effected.
A
telegram
was
dispatched
to
each
of
the
stations
between
St.
Helens
and
Manchester,
and
the
superintendent
and
traffic
manager
waited
in
the
utmost
suspense
at
the
instrument
for
the
series
of
replies
which
would
enable
them
to
say
for
certain
what
had
become
of
the
missing
train.
The
answers
came
back
in
the
order
of
questions,
which
was
the
order
of
the
stations
beginning
at
the
St.
Helens
end
"Special
