man
to
cause
us
to
reconsider
our
conclusions.
According
to
my
theory,
this
man
saw
the
young
fellow
cross
from
one
train
to
the
other,
saw
him
open
the
door,
heard
the
pistol
shot,
saw
the
two
fugitives
spring
out
on
to
the
line,
realized
that
murder
had
been
done,
and
sprang
out
himself
in
pursuit.
Why
he
has
never
been
heard
of
since
whether
he
met
his
own
death
in
the
pursuit,
or
whether,
as
is
more
likely,
he
was
made
to
realize
that
it
was
not
a
case
for
his
interference
is
a
detail
which
we
have
at
present
no
means
of
explaining.
I
acknowledge
that
there
are
some
difficulties
in
the
way.
At
first
sight,
it
might
seem
improbable
that
at
such
a
moment
a
murderer
would
burden
himself
in
his
flight
with
a
brown
leather
bag.
My
answer
is
that
he
was
well
aware
that
if
the
bag
were
found
his
identity
would
be
established.
It
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
take
it
with
him.
My
theory
stands
or
falls
upon
one
point,
and
I
call
upon
the
railway
company
to
make
strict
inquiry
as
to
whether
a
ticket
was
found
unclaimed
in
the
local
