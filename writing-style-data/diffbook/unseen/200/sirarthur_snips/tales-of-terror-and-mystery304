disregard
and
forgive.
What
I
should
never
forgive
would
be
a
disloyal
spying
and
eavesdropping
in
order
to
satisfy
an
illicit
curiosity.
But
of
that,
Mr.
Colmore,
I
acquit
you.
"When
I
was
a
young
man,
sir,
many
years
younger
than
you
are
now,
I
was
launched
upon
town
without
a
friend
or
adviser,
and
with
a
purse
which
brought
only
too
many
false
friends
and
false
advisers
to
my
side.
I
drank
deeply
of
the
wine
of
life
if
there
is
a
man
living
who
has
drunk
more
deeply
he
is
not
a
man
whom
I
envy.
My
purse
suffered,
my
character
suffered,
my
constitution
suffered,
stimulants
became
a
necessity
to
me,
I
was
a
creature
from
whom
my
memory
recoils.
And
it
was
at
that
time,
the
time
of
my
blackest
degradation,
that
God
sent
into
my
life
the
gentlest,
sweetest
spirit
that
ever
descended
as
a
ministering
angel
from
above.
She
loved
me,
broken
as
I
was,
loved
me,
and
spent
her
life
in
making
a
man
once
more
of
that
which
had
degraded
itself
to
the
level
of
the
beasts.
"But
a
fell
disease
struck
her,
and
she
withered
away
before
my
eyes.
In
the
hour
