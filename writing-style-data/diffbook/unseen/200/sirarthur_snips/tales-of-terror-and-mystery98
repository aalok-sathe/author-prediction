merchant
knocked
loudly,
and,
as
he
turned
his
dark
face
towards
the
light,
Douglas
Stone
could
see
that
it
was
contracted
with
anxiety.
A
bolt
was
drawn,
and
an
elderly
woman
with
a
taper
stood
in
the
doorway,
shielding
the
thin
flame
with
her
gnarled
hand.
"Is
all
well?"
gasped
the
merchant.
"She
is
as
you
left
her,
sir."
"She
has
not
spoken?"
"No,
she
is
in
a
deep
sleep."
The
merchant
closed
the
door,
and
Douglas
Stone
walked
down
the
narrow
passage,
glancing
about
him
in
some
surprise
as
he
did
so.
There
was
no
oil
cloth,
no
mat,
no
hat
rack.
Deep
grey
dust
and
heavy
festoons
of
cobwebs
met
his
eyes
everywhere.
Following
the
old
woman
up
the
winding
stair,
his
firm
footfall
echoed
harshly
through
the
silent
house.
There
was
no
carpet.
The
bedroom
was
on
the
second
landing.
Douglas
Stone
followed
the
old
nurse
into
it,
with
the
merchant
at
his
heels.
Here,
at
least,
there
was
furniture
and
to
spare.
The
floor
was
littered
and
the
corners
piled
with
Turkish
cabinets,
inlaid
tables,
coats
of
chain
mail,
strange
pipes,
and
grotesque
weapons.
A
single
small
lamp
stood
upon
a
bracket
on
the
wall.
