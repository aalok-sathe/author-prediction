in
his
other
hand.
This
he
gave
to
the
man
in
black.
At
the
same
moment
one
of
the
varlets
approached
with
a
dark
object
in
his
hand,
which
even
in
my
dream
filled
me
with
a
vague
feeling
of
familiarity.
It
was
a
leathern
filler.
With
horrible
energy
he
thrust
it
but
I
could
stand
no
more.
My
hair
stood
on
end
with
horror.
I
writhed,
I
struggled,
I
broke
through
the
bonds
of
sleep,
and
I
burst
with
a
shriek
into
my
own
life,
and
found
myself
lying
shivering
with
terror
in
the
huge
library,
with
the
moonlight
flooding
through
the
window
and
throwing
strange
silver
and
black
traceries
upon
the
opposite
wall.
Oh,
what
a
blessed
relief
to
feel
that
I
was
back
in
the
nineteenth
century
back
out
of
that
mediaeval
vault
into
a
world
where
men
had
human
hearts
within
their
bosoms.
I
sat
up
on
my
couch,
trembling
in
every
limb,
my
mind
divided
between
thankfulness
and
horror.
To
think
that
such
things
were
ever
done
that
they
could
be
done
without
God
striking
the
villains
dead.
Was
it
all
a
fantasy,
or
did
it
really
stand
for
something
which
had
happened
in
the
