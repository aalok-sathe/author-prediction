to

it.
As
to
the
only
positive
evidence
in
the
case
the
muddy
footmarks
upon
the
floor
they
were
so
blurred
by
the
softness
of
the
carpet
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
any
trustworthy
deduction
from
them.
The
most
that
could
be
said
was
that
their
appearance
was
not
inconsistent
with
the
theory
that
they
were
made
by
the
accused,
and
it
was
further
shown
that
his
boots
were
very

that
night.
There

which
had
preceded
the
crimes
all
combined
to
make
the
affair
one
of
those
dramas
which
absorb
the
whole
interest
of
a
nation.
Throughout
the
three
kingdoms
men
discussed
the
case
of
the
Black
Doctor
of
Bishop's
Crossing,
and
many
were
the
theories
put
forward
to
explain
the
facts;
but
it
may
safely
be
said
that
