but
the
words
were
lost
in
the
bustle
of
the
departure.
Palmer
stepped
into
the
guard's
van,
as
it
came
up
to
him,
and
thought
no
more
of
the
incident.
Twelve
minutes
after
its
departure
the
train
reached
Willesden
Junction,
where
it
stopped
for
a
very
short
interval.
An
examination
of
the
tickets
has
made
it
certain
that
no
one
either
joined
or
left
it
at

time,
and
no

At
5:14
the
journey
to
Manchester
was
resumed,

Rugby
was

a
remarkable
state
of
affairs.
The
smoking
carriage
in
which
the
short,
red
faced
man
with
the
black
beard
had
been
seen
was
now
empty.
Save
for
a
half
smoked
cigar,
there
was
no
trace
whatever
of
its
recent
occupant.
The
door
of
this
carriage
was
fastened.
In
the
next
compartment,
to
which
attention
had
been
originally
drawn,
there
was
no
sign
