Unless
we
get
something
positive
within
the
next
hour
I'll
take
Inspector
Collins,
and
go
down
myself."
And
then
at
last
something
positive
did
occur.
It
took
the
shape
of
another
telegram
from
Kenyon
Junction.
"Regret
to
report
that
the
dead
body
of
John
Slater,
driver
of
the
special
train,
has
just
been
found
among
the
gorse
bushes
at
a
point
two
and
a
quarter
miles
from
the
Junction.
Had
fallen
from
his
engine,
pitched
down
the
embankment,
and
rolled
among
the
bushes.
Injuries
to
his
head,
from
the
fall,
appear
to
be
cause
of
death.
Ground
has
now
been
carefully
examined,
and
there
is
no
trace
of
the
missing
train."
The
country
was,
as
has
already
been
stated,
in
the
throes
of
a
political
crisis,
and
the
attention
of
the
public
was
further
distracted
by
the
important
and
sensational
developments
in
Paris,
where
a
huge
scandal
threatened
to
destroy
the
Government
and
to
wreck
the
reputations
of
many
of
the
leading
men
in
France.
The
papers
were
full
of
these
events,
and
the
singular
disappearance
of
the
special
train
attracted
less
attention
than
would
have
been
the
case
in
more
peaceful
times.
The
grotesque
nature
of
the
event
helped
