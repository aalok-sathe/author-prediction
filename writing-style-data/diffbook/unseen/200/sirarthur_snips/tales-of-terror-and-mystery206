of
my
English
agent
who
is
a
man
with
a
considerable
future
before
him,
unless
some
complaint
of
the
throat
carries
him
off
before
his
time.
He
had
charge
of
all
arrangements
at
Liverpool,
whilst
I
was
stationed
at
the
inn
at
Kenyon,
where
I
awaited
a
cipher
signal
to
act.
When
the
special
was
arranged
for,
my
agent
instantly
telegraphed
to
me
and
warned
me
how
soon
I
should
have
everything
ready.
He
himself
under
the
name
of
Horace
Moore
applied
immediately
for
a
special
also,
in
the
hope
that
he
would
be
sent
down
with
Monsieur
Caratal,
which
might
under
certain
circumstances
have
been
helpful
to
us.
If,
for
example,
our
great
coup
had
failed,
it
would
then
have
become
the
duty
of
my
agent
to
have
shot
them
both
and
destroyed
their
papers.
Caratal
was
on
his
guard,
however,
and
refused
to
admit
any
other
traveller.
My
agent
then
left
the
station,
returned
by
another
entrance,
entered
the
guard's
van
on
the
side
farthest
from
the
platform,
and
travelled
down
with
McPherson
the
guard.
"In
the
meantime
you
will
be
interested
to
know
what
my
movements
were.
Everything
had
been
prepared
for
days
before,
and
only
the
