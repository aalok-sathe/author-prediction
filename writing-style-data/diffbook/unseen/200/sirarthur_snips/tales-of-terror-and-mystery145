manners
on
the
score
of
her
ignorance
of
our
customs.
She
did
not
attempt
to
conceal,
however,
either
then
or
afterwards,
that
I
was
no
very
welcome
visitor
at
Greylands
Court.
Her
actual
words
were,
as
a
rule,
courteous,
but
she
was
the
possessor
of
a
pair
of
particularly
expressive
dark
eyes,
and
I
read
in
them
very
clearly
from
the
first
that
she
heartily
wished
me
back
in
London
once
more.
However,
my
debts
were
too
pressing

had
been
spared
by
him

make
me
comfortable.
My
room
was
a
charming
one.
He
implored
me
to
tell
him
anything
which
could
add
to
my
happiness.
It
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
inform
him
that
a
blank
cheque
would
materially
help
towards
that
end,
but
I
felt
that
it
might
be
premature
in
the
present
state
of
our
acquaintance.
The
dinner
was
excellent,
and
as
we
sat
together
afterwards
over
his
Havanas
and
coffee,
