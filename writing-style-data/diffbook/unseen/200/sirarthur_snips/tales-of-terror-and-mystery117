which
had
impressed
themselves
upon
my
mind
were
high
on
the
wall,
and
not
to
be
found
by
touch.
Still,
I
remembered
in
a
general
way
how
the
sides
were
situated,
and
I
hoped
that
by
groping
my
way
along
them
I
should
at
last
come
to
the
opening
of
the
Roman
tunnel.
Moving
very
slowly,
and
continually
striking
against
the
rocks,
I
set
out
on
this
desperate
quest.
But
I
very
soon
realized
how
impossible
it
was.
In
that
black,
velvety
darkness
one
lost
all
one's
bearings
in
an
instant.
Before
I
had
made
a
dozen
paces,
I
was
utterly
bewildered
as
to
my
whereabouts.
The
rippling
of
the
stream,
which
was
the
one
sound
audible,
showed
me
where
it
lay,
but
the
moment
that
I
left
its
bank
I
was
utterly
lost.
The
idea
of
finding
my
way
back
in
absolute
darkness
through
that
limestone
labyrinth
was
clearly
an
impossible
one.
I
sat
down
upon
a
boulder
and
reflected
upon
my
unfortunate
plight.
I
had
not
told
anyone
that
I
proposed
to
come
to
the
Blue
John
mine,
and
it
was
unlikely
that
a
search
party
would
come
after
me.
Therefore
I
must
trust
to
my
own
resources
