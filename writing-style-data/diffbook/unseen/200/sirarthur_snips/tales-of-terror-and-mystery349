Look
at
the
trick
of
putting
in
a
dash
instead
of
a
stop!"
"They
are
undoubtedly
from
the
same
hand
with
some
attempt
at
disguise
in
the
case
of
this
first
one."
"The
second,"
said
Ward
Mortimer,
"is
the
letter
of
congratulation
which
was
written
to
me
by
Professor
Andreas
upon
my
obtaining
my
appointment."
I
stared
at
him
in
amazement.
Then
I
turned
over
the
letter
in
my
hand,
and
there,
sure

There
could
be
no

in
the
mind
of
anyone
who

you.
If
he
had
any
such
misgivings,
why
could
he
not
come
and
tell
me
direct?"
"Will
you
speak
to
him
about
it?"
"There
again
I
am
in
doubt.
He
might
choose
to
deny
that
he
wrote
it."
"At
any
rate,"
said
I,
"this
warning
is
meant
in
a
friendly
spirit,
and
I
should
certainly
act
upon
it.
