London,
where
it
now
lies.
The
first
two
pages
of
the
manuscript
are
missing.
There
is
also
one
torn
away
at
the
end
of
the
narrative,
though
none
of
these
affect
the
general
coherence
of
the
story.
It
is
conjectured
that
the
missing
opening
is
concerned
with
the
record
of
Mr.
Joyce
Armstrong's
qualifications
as
an
aeronaut,
which
can
be
gathered
from
other
sources
and
are
admitted
to
be
unsurpassed
among
the
air
pilots
of
England.
For
many
years
he
has
been
looked
upon
as
among
the
most
daring
and
the
most
intellectual
of
flying
men,
a
combination
which
has
enabled
him
to
both
invent
and
test
several
new
devices,
including
the
common
gyroscopic
attachment
which
is
known
by
his
name.
The
main
body
of
the
manuscript
is
written
neatly
in
ink,
but
the
last
few
lines
are
in
pencil
and
are
so
ragged
as
to
be
hardly
legible
exactly,
in
fact,
as
they
might
be
expected
to
appear
if
they
were
scribbled
off
hurriedly
from
the
seat
of
a
moving
aeroplane.
There
are,
it
may
be
added,
several
stains,
both
on
the
last
page
and
on
the
outside
cover
which
have
been
pronounced
by
the
Home
Office
experts
to
