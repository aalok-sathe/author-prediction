my
house
in
Wiltshire.
I
rather
think
there
is
a
third
in
the
Homburg
Wiesbaden
district.
"It
was
the
disappearance
of
the
airmen
that
first
set
me
thinking.
Of
course,
everyone
said
that
they
had
fallen
into
the
sea,
but
that
did
not
satisfy
me
at
all.
First,
there
was
Verrier
in
France;
his
machine
was
found
near
Bayonne,
but
they
never
got
his
body.
There
was
the
case
of
Baxter
also,
who
vanished,
though
his
engine
and
some
of
the
iron
fixings
were
found
in
a
wood
in
Leicestershire.
In
that
case,
Dr.
Middleton,
of
Amesbury,
who
was
watching
the
flight
with
a
telescope,
declares
that
just
before
the
clouds
obscured
the
view
he
saw
the
machine,
which
was
at
an
enormous
height,
suddenly
rise
perpendicularly
upwards
in
a
succession
of
jerks
in
a
manner
that
he
would
have
thought
to
be
impossible.
That
was
the
last
seen
of
Baxter.
There
was
a
correspondence
in
the
papers,
but
it
never
led
to
anything.
There
were
several
other
similar
cases,
and
then
there
was
the
death
of
Hay
Connor.
What
a
cackle
there
was
about
an
unsolved
mystery
of
the
air,
and
what
columns
in
the
halfpenny
papers,
and
yet
