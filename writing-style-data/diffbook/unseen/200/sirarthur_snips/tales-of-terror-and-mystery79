the
observation
of
the
student.
"What
would
happen
if
the
light
went
out?"
he
asked,
as
they
hurried
onwards.
"I
have
a
spare
candle
and
a
box
of
matches
in
my
pocket.
By
the
way,
Kennedy,
have
you
any
matches?"
"No;
you
had
better
give
me
some."
"Oh,
that
is
all
right.
There
is
no
chance
of
our
separating."
"How
far
are
we
going?
It
seems
to
me
that
we
have
walked
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
mile."
"More
than
that,
I
think.
There
is
really
no
limit
to
the
tombs
at
least,
I
have
never
been
able
to
find
any.
This
is
a
very
difficult
place,
so
I
think
that
I
will
use
our
ball
of
string."
He
fastened
one
end
of
it
to
a
projecting
stone
and
he
carried
the
coil
in
the
breast
of
his
coat,
paying
it
out
as
he
advanced.
Kennedy
saw
that
it
was
no
unnecessary
precaution,
for
the
passages
had
become
more
complex
and
tortuous
than
ever,
with
a
perfect
network
of
intersecting
corridors.
But
these
all
ended
in
one
large
circular
hall
with
a
square
pedestal
of
tufa
topped
with
a
slab
of
marble
at
one
end
of
it.
"By
Jove!"
