for
me.
I
am
convinced
that
I
could
not
stand
it
any
longer.
It
is
a
nightmare
a
horrible
nightmare
that
I
should
be
arrested
as
a
burglar
in
what
has
been
for
so
long
my
own
museum.
And
yet
I
cannot
blame
you.
You
could
not
have
done
otherwise.
My
hope
always
was
that
I
should
get
it
all
over
before
I
was
detected.
This
would
have
been
my
last
night's
work."
"How
did
you
get
in?"
asked
Mortimer.
"By
taking
a
very
great
liberty
with
your
private
door.
But
the
object
justified
it.
The
object
justified
everything.
You
will
not
be
angry
when
you
know
everything
at
least,
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me.
I
had
a
key
to
your
side
door
and
also
to
the
museum
door.
I
did
not
give
them
up
when
I
left.
And
so
you
see
it
was
not
difficult
for
me
to
let
myself
into
the
museum.
I
used
to
come
in
early
before
the
crowd
had
cleared
from
the
street.
Then
I
hid
myself
in
the
mummy
case,
and
took
refuge
there
whenever
Simpson
came
round.
I
could
always
hear
him
coming.
I
used
to
leave
in
the
same
way
