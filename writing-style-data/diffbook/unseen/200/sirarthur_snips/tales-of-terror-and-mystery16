Then
the
drift
swirled
inwards
again
and
the
great
solitude
was
unbroken.
"Just
after
ten
I
touched
the
lower
edge
of
the
upper
cloud
stratum.
It
consisted
of
fine
diaphanous
vapour
drifting
swiftly
from
the
westwards.
The
wind
had
been
steadily
rising
all
this
time
and
it
was
now
blowing
a
sharp
breeze
twenty
eight
an
hour
by
my
gauge.
Already
it
was
very
cold,
though
my
altimeter
only
marked
nine
thousand.
The
engines
were
working
beautifully,
and
we
went
droning
steadily
upwards.
The
cloud
bank
was
thicker
than
I
had
expected,
but
at
last
it
thinned
out
into
a
golden
mist
before
me,
and
then
in
an
instant
I
had
shot
out
from
it,
and
there
was
an
unclouded
sky
and
a
brilliant
sun
above
my
head
all
blue
and
gold
above,
all
shining
silver
below,
one
vast,
glimmering
plain
as
far
as
my
eyes
could
reach.
It
was
a
quarter
past
ten
o'clock,
and
the
barograph
needle
pointed
to
twelve
thousand
eight
hundred.
Up
I
went
and
up,
my
ears
concentrated
upon
the
deep
purring
of
my
motor,
my
eyes
busy
always
with
the
watch,
the
revolution
indicator,
the
petrol
lever,
and
the
oil
pump.
No
wonder
