With
this
foreword
I
append
his
account
exactly
as
he
left
it.
It
is
in
the
form
of
a
diary,
some
entries
in
which

a

April
17.
Already
I
feel
the
benefit
of
this
wonderful
upland
air.
The
farm
of
the
Allertons
lies
fourteen
hundred
and
twenty
feet
above
sea
level,
so
it
may
well
be
a
bracing
climate.
Beyond
the
usual
morning
cough
I
have
very
little
discomfort,
and,
what
with
the
fresh
milk
and
the
home
grown
mutton,
I
have
every
chance
of
putting
on
weight.
I
think
Saunderson
will
be
pleased.
The
two
Miss
Allertons
are
charmingly
quaint
and
kind,
two
dear
little
hard
working
old
maids,
who
are
ready
to
lavish
all
the
heart
which
might
have
gone
out
to
husband
and
to
children
upon
an
invalid
stranger.
Truly,
the
old
maid
is
a
most
useful
person,
one
of
the
reserve
forces
of
the
community.
They
talk
of
the
superfluous
woman,
but
what
would
the
poor
superfluous
man
do
without
her
kindly
presence?
By
the
way,
in
their
simplicity
they
very
quickly
let
out
the
reason
why
Saunderson
recommended
their
farm.
