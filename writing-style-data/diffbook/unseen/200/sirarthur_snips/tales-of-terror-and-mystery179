I
thought
of
the
time
which
had
elapsed,
and
how
it
coincided
with
my
injuries.
"Then
Lord
Southerton
must
have
died
about
the
same
time
that
I
was
hurt?"
"His
death
occurred
upon
that
very
day."
Summers
looked
hard
at
me
as
I
spoke,
and
I
am
convinced
for
he
was
a
very
shrewd
fellow
that
he
had
guessed
the
true
state
of
the
case.
He
paused
for
a
moment
as
if
awaiting
a
confidence
from
me,
but
I
could
not
see
what

you
are
aware
that
your
cousin
Everard

been

instead
of

who
had
been
torn

pieces
by
this
tiger,
or
whatever
it
was,
then
of
course
he
would
have
been
Lord
Southerton
at
the
present
moment."
"No
doubt,"
said
I.
"And
he
took
such
an
interest
in
it,"
said
Summers.
"I
happen
to
know
that
the
late
Lord
Southerton's
valet
was
in
his
pay,
and
that
he
used
to
have
telegrams
from
him
