now
than
there
was
five
years
ago
when
mother
was
still
living.
But
for
all
that,
I
had
rather
cover
up
our
tracks
all
I
can.
But
I
owe
you
an
explanation,
for
if
your
idea
of
it
was
wrong,
it
was
a
mighty
ingenious
one
all
the
same.
I'll
have
to
go
back
a
little
so
as
you
may
understand
all
about
it.
"My
people
came
from
Bucks,
England,
and
emigrated
to
the
States
in
the
early
fifties.
They
settled
in
Rochester,
in
the
State
of
New
York,
where
my
father
ran
a
large
dry
goods
store.
There
were
only
two
sons:
myself,
James,
and
my
brother,
Edward.
I
was
ten
years
older
than
my
brother,
and
after
my
father
died
I
sort
of
took
the
place
of
a
father
to
him,
as
an
elder
brother
would.
He
was
a
bright,
spirited
boy,
and
just
one
of
the
most
beautiful
creatures
that
ever
lived.
But
there
was
always
a
soft
spot
in
him,
and
it
was
like
mould
in
cheese,
for
it
spread
and
spread,
and
nothing
that
you
could
do
would
stop
it.
Mother
saw
it
just
as
clearly
as
I
did,
but
she
went
on
spoiling
him
