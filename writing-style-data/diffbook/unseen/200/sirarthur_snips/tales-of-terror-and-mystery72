how
about
the
other
man?"
Kennedy
shrugged
his
shoulders.
"I
suppose
it
is
the
survival
of
the
fittest,"
said
he.
"If
he
had
been
the
better
man
she
would
not
have
deserted
him.
Let's
drop
the
subject,
for
I
have
had
enough
of
it!"
"Only
one
other
thing.
How
did
you
get
rid
of
her
in
three
weeks?"
"Well,
we
had
both
cooled
down
a
bit,
you
understand.
She
absolutely
refused,
under

to
come

and
the
whole
thing
became
so
unpleasant
that
really
though
I
missed
her
dreadfully
at
first
I
was
very
glad
to
slip
out
of
it.
Now,
I
rely
upon
you
not
to
repeat
anything
of
what
I
have
said."
"My
dear
Kennedy,
I
should
not
dream
of
repeating
it.
But
all
that
you
say
interests
me
very
much,
for
it
gives
me
an
insight
into
your
way
of
