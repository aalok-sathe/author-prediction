thought
you
would
not
mind
his
accompanying
me."
"I
lead
a
retired
life,
Dr.
Hamilton,
and
my
aversion
to
strangers
grows
upon
me,"
said
our
host.
"I
have
sometimes
thought
that
my
nerves
are
not
so
good
as
they
were.
My
travels
in
search
of
beetles
in
my
younger
days
took
me
into
many
malarious
and
unhealthy
places.
But
a
brother
coleopterist
like
yourself
is
always
a
welcome
guest,
and
I
shall
be
delighted
if
you
will
look
over
my
collection,
which
I
think
that
I
may
without
exaggeration
describe
as
the
best
in
Europe."
And
so
no
doubt
it
was.
He
had
a
huge,
oaken
cabinet
arranged
in
shallow
drawers,
and
here,
neatly
ticketed
and
classified,
were
beetles
from
every
corner
of
the
earth,
black,
brown,
blue,
green,
and
mottled.
Every
now
and
then
as
he
swept
his
hand
over
the
lines
and
lines
of
impaled
insects
he
would
catch
up
some
rare
specimen,
and,
handling
it
with
as
much
delicacy
and
reverence
as
if
it
were
a
precious
relic,
he
would
hold
forth
upon
its
peculiarities
and
the
circumstances
under
which
it
came
into
his
possession.
It
was
evidently
an
unusual
thing
for
him
to
meet
with
a
