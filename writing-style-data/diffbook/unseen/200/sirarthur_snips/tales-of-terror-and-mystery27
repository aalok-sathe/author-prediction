the
air
around
them.
These
air
snakes
were
of
a
very
light
grey
or
smoke
colour,
with
some
darker
lines
within,
which
gave
the
impression
of
a
definite
organism.
One
of
them
whisked
past
my
very
face,
and
I
was
conscious
of
a
cold,
clammy
contact,
but
their
composition
was
so
unsubstantial
that
I
could
not
connect
them
with
any
thought
of
physical
danger,
any
more
than
the
beautiful
bell
like
creatures
which
had
preceded
them.
There
was
no
more
solidity
in
their
frames
than
in
the
floating
spume
from
a

wave.
"But
a
more
terrible
experience
was
in

for
me.
Floating
downwards
from

there
came
a

to
be
hundreds
of
square
feet
in
size.
Though
fashioned
of
some
transparent,
jelly
like
substance,
it
was
none
the
less
of
much
more
definite
outline
and
solid
consistence
than
anything
which
I
had
seen
before.
There
were
more
traces,
too,
of
a
physical
organization,
especially
two
vast,
shadowy,
circular
plates
upon
either
side,
which
may
have
been
eyes,
and
a
perfectly
solid
white
projection
between
