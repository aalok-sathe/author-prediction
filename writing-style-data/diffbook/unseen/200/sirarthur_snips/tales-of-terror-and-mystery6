"Nevertheless,
when
I
dined
at
Rheims
with
Coselli
and
Gustav
Raymond
I
found
that
neither
of
them
was
aware
of
any
particular
danger
in
the
higher
layers
of
the
atmosphere.
I
did
not
actually
say
what
was
in
my
thoughts,
but
I
got
so
near
to
it
that
if
they
had
any
corresponding
idea
they
could
not
have
failed
to
express
it.
But
then
they
are
two
empty,
vainglorious
fellows
with
no
thought
beyond
seeing
their
silly
names
in
the
newspaper.
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
neither
of
them
had
ever
been
much
beyond
the
twenty

Of
course,
men
have
been
higher
than
this
both
in
balloons
and
in
the
ascent
of
mountains.
It
must
be
well
above
that
point
that
the
aeroplane
enters
the
danger
zone
always
presuming
that
my
premonitions
are
correct.
"Aeroplaning
has
been
with
us
now
for
more
than
twenty
years,
and
one
might
well
ask:
Why
should
this
peril
be
only
revealing
itself
in
our
day?
The
answer
is
obvious.
In
the
old
days
of
weak
engines,
when
a
hundred
horse
power
Gnome
or
Green
was
considered
ample
for
every
need,
