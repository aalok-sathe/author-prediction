the
greatest
men
in
France
as
these
ninepins
and
then
this
Monsieur
Caratal
was
the
ball
which
could
be
seen
coming
from
far
away.
If
he
arrived,
then
it
was
pop,
pop,
pop
for
all
of
them.
It
was
determined
that
he
should
not
arrive.
"I
do
not
accuse
them
all
of
being
conscious
of
what
was
to
happen.
There
were,
as
I
have
said,
great
financial
as
well
as
political
interests
at
stake,
and
a
syndicate
was
formed
to
manage
the
business.
Some
subscribed
to
the
syndicate

hardly
understood
what
were

But
others
understood
very

and
they
can
rely
upon
it

I
have
not
forgotten
their
names.
They
had
ample
warning
that
Monsieur
Caratal
was
coming
long
before
he
left
South
America,
and
they
knew
that
the
evidence
which
he
held
would
certainly
mean
ruin
to
all
of
them.
The
syndicate
had
the
command
of
an
unlimited
amount
of
money
absolutely
unlimited,
you
understand.
They
looked
round
for
an
agent
who
was
capable
of
wielding
this
gigantic
power.
The
man
chosen
must
be
inventive,
resolute,
adaptive
a
man
in
a
million.
They
chose
Herbert
de
Lernac,
and
I
admit
that
they
were
right.
