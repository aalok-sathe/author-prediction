it."
There
was
an
absence
of
surprise
in
her
manner
which
suggested
a
new
idea
to
me.
"You
have
heard
it
before,"
I
cried.
"I
could
not
help
it.
My
own
room
is
higher
up
on
the
same
turret.
It
has
happened
frequently."
"Who
can
the
woman
be?"
"I
have
no
idea.
I
had
rather
not
discuss
it."
Her
voice
was
enough
to
show
me
what
she
thought.
But
granting
that
our
employer
led
a
double
and
dubious
life,
who
could
she
be,
this
mysterious
woman
who
kept
him
company
in
the
old
tower?
I
knew
from
my
own
inspection
how
bleak
and
bare
a
room
it
was.
She
certainly
did
not
live
there.
But
in
that
case
where
did
she
come
from?
It
could
not
be
anyone
of
the
household.
They
were
all
under
the
vigilant
eyes
of
Mrs.
Stevens.
The
visitor
must
come
from
without.
But
how?
And
then
suddenly
I
remembered
how
ancient
this
building
was,
and
how
probable
that
some
mediaeval
passage
existed
in
it.
There
is
hardly
an
old
castle
without
one.
The
mysterious
room
was
the
basement
of
the
turret,
so
that
if
there
were
anything
of
the
sort
it
would
open
through
the
