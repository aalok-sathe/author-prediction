in
the
Capitol.
There
are,
as
you
see,
twelve
magnificent
stones,
inscribed
with
mystical
characters.
Counting
from
the
left
hand
top
corner,
the
stones
are
carnelian,
peridot,
emerald,
ruby,
lapis
lazuli,
onyx,
sapphire,
agate,
amethyst,
topaz,
beryl,
and
jasper."
I
was
amazed
at
the
variety
and
beauty
of
the
stones.
"Has
the
breastplate
any
particular
history?"
I
asked.
"It
is
of
great
age
and
of

said
Professor
Andreas.
"Without
being
able
to
make
an
absolute

any
collection
in
Europe.
My
friend,
Captain
Wilson,
here,
is
a
practical
authority
upon
precious
stones,
and
he
would
tell
you
how
pure
these
are."
Captain
Wilson,
a
man
with
a
dark,
hard,
incisive
face,
was
standing
beside
his
fiancee
at
the
other
side
of
the
case.
"Yes,"
said
he,
curtly,
"I
have
never
seen
finer
stones."
"And
the
gold
work
is
also
worthy
of
attention.
The
ancients
excelled
in
"
he
was
apparently
about
to
indicate
the
setting
of
the
stones,
when
Captain
Wilson
interrupted
him.
"You
