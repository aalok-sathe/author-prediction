however,
when
I
reflected
how
absurd
it
was
to
associate
so
huge
and
shapeless
a
mark
with
the
track
of
any
known
animal.
Even
an
elephant
could
not
have
produced
it.
I
determined,
therefore,
that
I
would
not
be
scared
by
vague
and
senseless
fears
from
carrying
out
my
exploration.
Before
proceeding,
I
took
good
note
of
a
curious
rock
formation
in
the
wall
by
which
I
could
recognize
the
entrance
of
the
Roman
tunnel.
The
precaution
was
very
necessary,
for
the
great
cave,
so
far
as
I
could
see
it,
was
intersected
by
passages.
Having
made
sure
of
my
position,
and
reassured
myself
by
examining
my
spare
candles
and
my
matches,
I
advanced
slowly
over
the
rocky
and
uneven
surface
of
the
cavern.
And
now
I
come
to
the
point
where
I
met
with
such
sudden
and
desperate
disaster.
A
stream,
some
twenty
feet
broad,
ran
across
my
path,
and
I
walked
for
some
little
distance
along
the
bank
to
find
a
spot
where
I
could
cross
dry
shod.
Finally,
I
came
to
a
place
where
a
single
flat
boulder
lay
near
the
centre,
which
I
could
reach
in
a
stride.
As
it
chanced,
however,
the
rock
had
been
