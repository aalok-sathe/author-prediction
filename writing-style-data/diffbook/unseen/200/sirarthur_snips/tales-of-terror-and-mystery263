train
through
Harrow
and
King's
Langley
upon
the
18th
of
March.
If
such
a
ticket
were
found
my
case
is
proved.
If
not,
my
theory
may
still
be
the
correct
one,
for
it
is
conceivable
either
that
he
travelled
without
a
ticket
or
that
his
ticket
was
lost."
To
this
elaborate
and
plausible
hypothesis
the
answer
of
the
police
and
of
the
company
was,
first,
that
no
such
ticket
was
found;
secondly,
that
the
slow
train
would
never
run
parallel
to
the
express;
and,
thirdly,
that
the
local
train
had
been
stationary
in
King's
Langley
Station
when
the
express,
going
at
fifty
miles
an
hour,
had
flashed
past
it.
So
perished
the
only
satisfying
explanation,
and
five
years
have
elapsed
without
supplying
a
new
one.
Now,
at
last,
there
comes
a
statement
which
covers
all
the
facts,
and
which
must
be
regarded
as
authentic.
It
took
the
shape
of
a
letter
dated
from
New
York,
and
addressed
to
the
same
criminal
investigator
whose
theory
I
have
quoted.
It
is
given
here
in
extenso,
with
the
exception
of
the
two
opening
paragraphs,
which
are
personal
in
their
nature:
"You'll
excuse
me
if
I'm
not
very
free
with
names.
There's
less
reason
