a
fool
and
a
fool
you
have
been."
She
crept
out
of
the
room,
the
bitter,
singular
woman,
and
I
was
never
destined
to
see
her
again.
With
what
remained
from
her
husband's
property
she
went
back
to
her
native
land,
and
I
have
heard
that
she
afterwards
took
the
veil
at
Pernambuco.
It
was
not
until
I
had
been
back
in
London
for
some
time
that
the
doctors
pronounced
me
to
be
well
enough
to
do
business.
It
was
not
a
very
welcome
permission
to
me,
for
I
feared
that
it
would
be
the
signal
for
an
inrush
of
creditors;
but
it
was
Summers,
my
lawyer,
who
first
took
advantage
of
it.
"I
am
very
glad
to
see
that
your
lordship
is
so
much
better,"
said
he.
"I
have
been
waiting
a
long
time
to
offer
my
congratulations."
"What
do
you
mean,
Summers?
This
is
no
time
for
joking."
"I
mean
what
I
say,"
he
answered.
"You
have
been
Lord
Southerton
for
the
last
six
weeks,
but
we
feared
that
it
would
retard
your
recovery
if
you
were
to
learn
it."
Lord
Southerton!
One
of
the
richest
peers
in
England!
I
could
not
believe
my
ears.
And
then
suddenly
