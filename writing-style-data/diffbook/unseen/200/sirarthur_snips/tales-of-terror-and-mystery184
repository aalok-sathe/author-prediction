a
second
entered
with
a
similar
request.
This
was
a
Mr.
Horace
Moore,
a
gentlemanly
man
of
military
appearance,
who
alleged
that
the
sudden
serious
illness
of
his
wife
in
London
made
it
absolutely
imperative
that
he
should
not
lose
an
instant
in
starting
upon
the
journey.
His
distress
and
anxiety
were
so
evident
that
Mr.
Bland
did
all
that
was
possible
to
meet
his
wishes.
A
second
special
was
out
of
the
question,
as
the
ordinary
local
service
was
already
somewhat
deranged
by
the
first.
There
was
the
alternative,
however,
that
Mr.
Moore
should
share
the
expense
of
Monsieur
Caratal's
train,
and
should
travel
in
the
other
empty
first
class
compartment,
if
Monsieur
Caratal
objected
to
having
him
in
the
one
which
he
occupied.
It
was
difficult
to
see
any
objection
to
such
an
arrangement,
and
yet
Monsieur
Caratal,
upon
the
suggestion
being
made
to
him
by
Mr.
Potter
Hood,
absolutely
refused
to
consider
it
for
an
instant.
The
train
was
his,
he
said,
and
he
would
insist
upon
the
exclusive
use
of
it.
All
argument
failed
to
overcome
his
ungracious
objections,
and
finally
the
plan
had
to
be
abandoned.
Mr.
Horace
Moore
left
the
station
in
great
distress,
