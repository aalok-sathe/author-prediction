In
the
blaze
of
the
gun
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
great
shaggy
mass,
something
with
rough
and
bristling
hair
of
a
withered
grey
colour,
fading
away
to
white
in
its
lower
parts,
the
huge
body
supported
upon
short,
thick,
curving
legs.
I
had
just
that
glance,
and
then
I
heard
the
rattle
of
the
stones
as
the
creature
tore
down
into
its
burrow.
In
an
instant,
with
a
triumphant
revulsion
of
feeling,
I
had
cast
my
fears
to
the
wind,
and
uncovering
my
powerful
lantern,
with
my
rifle
in
my
hand,
I
sprang
down
from
my
rock
and
rushed
after
the
monster
down
the
old
Roman
shaft.
My
splendid
lamp
cast
a
brilliant
flood
of
vivid
light
in
front
of
me,
very
different
from
the
yellow
glimmer
which
had
aided
me
down
the
same
passage
only
twelve
days
before.
As
I
ran,
I
saw
the
great
beast
lurching
along
before
me,
its
huge
bulk
filling
up
the
whole
space
from
wall
to
wall.
Its
hair
looked
like
coarse
faded
oakum,
and
hung
down
in
long,
dense
masses
which
swayed
as
it
moved.
It
was
like
an
enormous
unclipped
sheep
in
its
fleece,
but
in
size
it
was
far
