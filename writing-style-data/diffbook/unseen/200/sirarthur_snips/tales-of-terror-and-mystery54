the
ordinary
and
to
the
extraordinary
question
in
order
that
she
might
be
forced
to
name
her
accomplices,
after
which
she
should
be
carried
in
a
cart
to
the
Place
de
Greve,
there
to
have
her
head
cut
off,
her
body
being
afterwards
burned
and
her
ashes
scattered
to
the
winds.'
"The
date
of
this
entry
is
July
16,
1676."
"It
is
interesting,"
said
I,
"but
not
convincing.
How
do
you
prove
the
two
women
to
be
the
same?"
"I
am
coming
to
that.
The
narrative
goes
on
to
tell
of
the
woman's
behaviour
when
questioned.
'When
the
executioner
approached
her
she
recognized
him
by
the
cords
which
he
held
in
his
hands,
and
she
at
once
held
out
her
own
hands
to
him,
looking
at
him
from
head
to
foot
without
uttering
a
word.'
How's
that?"
"Yes,
it
was
so."
"'She
gazed
without
wincing
upon
the
wooden
horse
and
rings
which
had
twisted
so
many
limbs
and
caused
so
many
shrieks
of
agony.
When
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
three
pails
of
water,
which
were
all
ready
for
her,
she
said
with
a
smile,
"All
that
water
must
have
been
brought
here
for
the
purpose
of
drowning
me,
Monsieur.
