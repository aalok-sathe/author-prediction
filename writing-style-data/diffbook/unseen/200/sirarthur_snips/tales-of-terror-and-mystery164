absurd.
I
knew
that
this
den
was
an
outhouse,
and
that
the
corridor
which
connected
it
with
the
house
was
at
least
a
hundred
feet
long.
Besides,
with
the
gale
thundering
outside,
my
cries
were
not
likely
to
be
heard.
I
had
only
my
own
courage
and
my
own
wits
to
trust
to.
And
then,
with
a
fresh
wave
of
horror,
my
eyes
fell
upon
the
lantern.
The
candle
had
burned
low,
and
was
already
beginning
to

In
ten
minutes
it
would
be
out.
I
had
only
ten
minutes
then
in
which
to
do
something,
for
I
felt
that
if
I
were
once
left
in
the
dark
with
that
fearful
beast

should
be
incapable
of
action.
The
very
thought
of
it
paralysed
me.
I
cast
my
despairing
eyes
round
this
chamber
of
death,
and
they
rested
upon
one
spot
which
seemed
to
promise
I
will
not
say
safety,
but
less
immediate
and
imminent
danger
than
the
open
floor.
I
have
said
that
the
cage
had
a
top
as
well
as
a
front,
and
this
top
was
left
standing
when
the
front
was
wound
through
the
slot
in
the
wall.
It
consisted
of
bars
at
a
few
inches'
interval,
