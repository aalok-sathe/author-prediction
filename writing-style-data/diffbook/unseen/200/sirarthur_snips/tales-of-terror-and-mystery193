fall,
is
a
question
upon
which
I
do
not
feel
qualified
to
offer
an
opinion."
In
conclusion,
the
inspector
offered
his
resignation
to
the
Board,
being
much
nettled
by
an
accusation
of
incompetence
in
the
London
papers.
A
month
elapsed,
during
which
both
the
police
and
the
company
prosecuted
their
inquiries
without
the
slightest
success.
A
reward
was
offered
and
a
pardon
promised
in
case
of
crime,
but
they
were
both
unclaimed.
Every
day
the
public
opened
their
papers
with
the
conviction
that
so
grotesque
a
mystery
would
at

In
broad

upon
a

a
train
with

if
some
master
of
subtle
chemistry
had
volatilized
it
into
gas.
Indeed,
among
the
various
conjectures
which
were
put
forward
in
the
public
Press,
there
were
some
which
seriously
asserted
that
supernatural,
or,
at
least,
preternatural,
agencies
had
been
at
work,
and
that
the
deformed
Monsieur
Caratal
was
probably
a
person
who
was
better
known
under
a
less
polite
name.
Others
fixed
upon
his
swarthy
companion
as
