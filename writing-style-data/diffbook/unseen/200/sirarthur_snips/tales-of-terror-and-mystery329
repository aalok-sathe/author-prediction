Has
anyone
up
to
now
expressed
any
doubt
about
the
matter?
Mr.
Porlock
Carr:
Not
to
my
knowledge.
Mr.
Humphrey:
We
hope
to
make
the
matter
clear.
The
Judge:
Then
the
court
adjourns
until
tomorrow.
This
new
development
of
the
case
excited
the
utmost
interest
among
the
general
public.
Press
comment
was
prevented
by
the
fact
that
the
trial
was

and
who
was
found
in
his
study.
This
letter
which
Miss
Morton
refused
to
produce
was
possibly
a
confession
of
guilt,
and
she
might
find
herself
in
the
terrible
position
of
only
being
able
to
save
her
brother
from
the
gallows
by
the
sacrifice
of
her
former
lover.
The
court
next
morning
was
crammed
to
overflowing,
and
a
murmur
of
excitement
passed
over
it
when
