who
undoubtedly
met
their
end
in
the
manner
described.
The
Joyce
Armstrong
Fragment
was
found
in
the
field
which
is
called
Lower
Haycock,
lying
one
mile
to
the
westward
of
the
village
of
Withyham,
upon
the
Kent
and
Sussex
border.
It
was
on
the
15th
September
last
that
an
agricultural
labourer,
James
Flynn,
in
the
employment
of
Mathew
Dodd,
farmer,
of
the
Chauntry
Farm,
Withyham,
perceived
a
briar
pipe
lying
near
the
footpath
which
skirts
the
hedge
in
Lower
Haycock.
A
few
paces
farther
on
he
picked
up
a
pair
of
broken
binocular
glasses.
Finally,
among
some
nettles
in
the
ditch,
he
caught
sight
of
a
flat,
canvas
backed
book,
which
proved
to
be
a
note
book
with
detachable
leaves,
some
of
which
had
come
loose
and
were
fluttering
along
the
base
of
the
hedge.
These
he
collected,
but
some,
including
the
first,
were
never
recovered,
and
leave
a
deplorable
hiatus
in
this
all
important
statement.
The
note
book
was
taken
by
the
labourer
to
his
master,
who
in
turn
showed
it
to
Dr.
J.
H.
Atherton,
of
Hartfield.
This
gentleman
at
once
recognized
the
need
for
an
expert
examination,
and
the
manuscript
was
forwarded
to
the
Aero
Club
in
