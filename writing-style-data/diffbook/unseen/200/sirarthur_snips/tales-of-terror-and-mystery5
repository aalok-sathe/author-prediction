was
one
manifestation
of
it.
Another
was
the
morbid
effect
which
the
fall
of
Lieutenant
Myrtle
had
upon
his
mind.
Myrtle,
who
was
attempting
the
height
record,
fell
from
an
altitude
of
something
over
thirty
thousand
feet.
Horrible
to
narrate,
his
head
was
entirely
obliterated,
though
his
body
and
limbs
preserved
their
configuration.
At
every
gathering
of
airmen,
Joyce
Armstrong,
according
to
Dangerfield,
would
ask,
with
an
enigmatic
smile:
"And
where,
pray,
is
Myrtle's
head?"
On
another
occasion
after
dinner,
at
the
mess
of
the
Flying
School
on
Salisbury
Plain,
he
started
a
debate
as
to
what
will
be
the
most
permanent
danger
which
airmen
will
have
to
encounter.
Having
listened
to
successive
opinions
as
to
air
pockets,
faulty
construction,
and
over
banking,
he
ended
by
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
refusing
to
put
forward
his
own
views,
though
he
gave
the
impression
that
they
differed
from
any
advanced
by
his
companions.
It
is
worth
remarking
that
after
his
own
complete
disappearance
it
was
found
that
his
private
affairs
were
arranged
with
a
precision
which
may
show
that
he
had
a
strong
premonition
of
disaster.
With
these
essential
explanations
I
will
now
give
the
narrative
exactly
as
it
stands,
