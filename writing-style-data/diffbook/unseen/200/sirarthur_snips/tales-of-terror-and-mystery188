will
have
to
go,"
said
Mr.
Bland,
grimly.
"There
has
been
a
wreck
and
they
have
missed
it.
The
special
has
obviously
run
off
the
metals
without
disturbing
the
line
how
it
could
have
done
so
passes
my
comprehension
but
so
it
must
be,
and
we
shall
have
a
wire
from
Kenyon
or
Barton
Moss
presently
to
say
that
they
have
found
her
at
the
bottom
of
an
embankment."
But
Mr.
Bland's
prophecy
was
not
destined
to
be
fulfilled.
Half
an
hour
passed,
and
then
there
arrived
the
following
message
from
the
station
master
of
Kenyon
Junction
"There
are
no
traces
of
the
missing
special.
It
is
quite
certain
that
she
passed
here,
and
that
she
did
not
arrive
at
Barton
Moss.
We
have
detached
engine
from
goods
train,
and
I
have
myself
ridden
down
the
line,
but
all
is
clear,
and
there
is
no
sign
of
any
accident."
Mr.
Bland
tore
his
hair
in
his
perplexity.
"This
is
rank
lunacy,
Hood!"
he
cried.
"Does
a
train
vanish
into
thin
air
in
England
in
broad
daylight?
The
thing
is
preposterous.
An
engine,
a
tender,
two
carriages,
a
van,
five
human
beings
and
all
lost
on
a
straight
line
of
railway!
