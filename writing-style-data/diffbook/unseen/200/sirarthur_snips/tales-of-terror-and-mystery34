his
sanity
would
prefer
not
to
dwell.
There
are
many,
as
I
am
aware,
who
still
jeer
at
the
facts
which
I
have
here
set
down,
but
even
they
must
admit
that
Joyce
Armstrong
has
disappeared,
and
I
would
commend
to
them
his
own
words:
"This
note
book
may
explain
what
I
am
trying
to
do,
and
how
I
lost
my
life
in
doing
it.
But
no
drivel
about
accidents
or
mysteries,
if
YOU
please."
The
Leather
Funnel
My
friend,
Lionel
Dacre,
lived
in
the
Avenue
de
Wagram,
Paris.
His
house
was
that
small
one,
with
the
iron
railings
and
grass
plot
in
front
of
it,
on
the
left
hand
side
as
you
pass
down
from
the
Arc
de
Triomphe.
I
fancy
that
it
had
been
there
long
before
the
avenue
was
constructed,
for
the
grey
tiles
were
stained
with
lichens,
and
the
walls
were
mildewed
and
discoloured
with
age.
It
looked
a
small
house
from
the
street,
five
windows
in
front,
if
I
remember
right,
but
it
deepened
into
a
single
long
chamber
at
the
back.
It
was
here
that
Dacre
had
that
singular
library
of
occult
literature,
and
the
fantastic
curiosities
which
served
as
a
hobby
for
himself,
