was
there,
and
that
they
had
seen
nothing,
but
it
was
their
custom
to
stand
in
the
middle
between
the
metals,
and
the
open
carriage
door
was
upon
the
far
side,
so
that
it
was
conceivable
that
someone
might
have
alighted
unseen,
as
the
darkness
would
by
that
time
be
drawing
in.
A
steep
embankment
would
instantly
screen
anyone
who
sprang
out
from
the
observation
of
the
navvies.
The
guard
also
deposed
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
movement
upon
the
platform
at
Willesden
Junction,
and
that
though
it
was
certain
that
no
one
had
either
joined
or
left
the
train
there,
it
was
still
quite
possible
that
some
of
the
passengers
might
have
changed
unseen
from
one
compartment
to
another.
It
was
by
no
means
uncommon
for
a
gentleman
to
finish
his
cigar
in
a
smoking
carriage
and
then
to
change
to
a
clearer
atmosphere.
Supposing
that
the
man
with
the
black
beard
had
done
so
at
Willesden
(and
the
half
smoked
cigar
upon
the
floor
seemed
to
favour
the
supposition),
he
would
naturally
go
into
the
nearest
section,
which
would
bring
him
into
the
company
of
the
two
other
actors
in
this
drama.
Thus
the
first
stage
