of
her
agony
it
was
never
of
herself,
of
her
own
sufferings
and
her
own
death
that
she
thought.
It
was
all
of
me.
The
one
pang
which
her
fate
brought
to
her
was
the
fear
that
when
her
influence
was
removed
I
should
revert
to
that
which
I
had
been.
It
was
in
vain
that
I
made
oath
to
her
that
no
drop
of
wine
would
ever
cross
my
lips.
She
knew
only
too
well
the
hold
that
the
devil
had
upon
me
she
who
had
striven
so
to
loosen
it
and
it
haunted
her
night
and
day
the
thought
that
my
soul
might
again
be
within
his
grip.
"It
was
from
some
friend's
gossip
of
the
sick
room
that
she
heard
of
this
invention
this
phonograph
and
with
the
quick
insight
of
a
loving
woman
she
saw
how
she
might
use
it
for
her
ends.
She
sent
me
to
London
to
procure
the
best
which
money
could
buy.
With
her
dying
breath
she
gasped
into
it
the
words
which
have
held
me
straight
ever
since.
Lonely
and
broken,
what
else
have
I
in
all
the
world
to
uphold
me?
But
it
is
enough.
Please
God,
I
shall
face
