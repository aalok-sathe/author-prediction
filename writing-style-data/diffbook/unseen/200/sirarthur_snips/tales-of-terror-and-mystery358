When
I
obeyed
his
summons
I
found
him
pacing
excitedly
up
and
down
the
central
room,
while
the
old
soldier
who
guarded
the
premises
stood
with
military
stiffness
in
a
corner.
"My
dear
Jackson,"
he
cried,
"I
am
so
delighted
that
you
have
come,
for
this
is
a
most
inexplicable
business."
"What
has
happened,
then?"
He
waved
his
hand
towards
the
case
which
contained
the
breastplate.
"Look
at
it,"
said
he.
I
did
so,
and
could
not
restrain
a
cry
of
surprise.
The
setting
of
the
middle
row
of
precious
stones
had
been
profaned
in
the
same
manner
as
the
upper
ones.
Of
the
twelve
jewels
eight
had
been
now
tampered
with
in
this
singular
fashion.
The
setting
of
the
lower
four
was
neat
and
smooth.
The
others
jagged
and
irregular.
"Have
the
stones
been
altered?"
I
asked.
"No,
I
am
certain
that
these
upper
four
are
the
same
which
the
expert
pronounced
to
be
genuine,
for
I
observed
yesterday
that
little
discoloration
on
the
edge
of
the
emerald.
Since
they
have
not
extracted
the
upper
stones,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
the
lower
have
been
transposed.
You
say
that
you
heard
nothing,
Simpson?"
"No,
sir,"
the
commissionaire
answered.
