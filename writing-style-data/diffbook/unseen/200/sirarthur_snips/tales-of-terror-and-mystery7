were
very
restricted.
Now
that
three
hundred
horse
power
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception,
visits
to
the
upper
layers
have
become
easier
and
more
common.
Some
of
us
can
remember
how,
in
our
youth,
Garros
made
a
world
wide
reputation
by
attaining
nineteen
thousand
feet,
and
it
was
considered
a
remarkable
achievement
to
fly
over
the
Alps.
Our
standard
now
has
been
immeasurably
raised,
and
there
are
twenty
high
flights
for
one
in
former
years.
Many
of
them
have
been
undertaken
with
impunity.
The
thirty
thousand
foot
level
has
been
reached
time
after
time
with
no
discomfort
beyond
cold
and
asthma.
What
does
this
prove?
A
visitor
might
descend
upon
this
planet
a
thousand
times
and
never
see
a
tiger.
Yet
tigers
exist,
and
if
he
chanced
to
come
down
into
a
jungle
he
might
be
devoured.
There
are
jungles
of
the
upper
air,
and
there
are
worse
things
than
tigers
which
inhabit
them.
I
believe
in
time
they
will
map
these
jungles
accurately
out.
Even
at
the
present
moment
I
could
name
two
of
them.
One
of
them
lies
over
the
Pau
Biarritz
district
of
France.
Another
is
just
over
my
head
as
I
write
here
