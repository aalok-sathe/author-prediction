Humphrey:
How
do
you
know
it?
Miss
Morton:
Because
Dr.
Lana
is
not
dead.
There
followed
a
prolonged
sensation
in
court,
which
interrupted
the
examination
of
the
witness.
Mr.
Humphrey:
And
how
do
you
know,
Miss
Morton,
that
Dr.
Lana
is
not
dead?
Miss
Morton:
Because
I
have
received
a
letter
from
him
since
the
date
of
his
supposed
death.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Have
you
this
letter?
Miss
Morton:
Yes,
but
I
should
prefer
not
to
show
it.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Have
you
the
envelope?
Miss
Morton:
Yes,
it
is
here.
Mr.
Humphrey:
What
is
the
post
mark?
Miss
Morton:
Liverpool.
Mr.
Humphrey:
And
the
date?
Miss
Morton:
June
the
22nd.
Mr.
Humphrey:
That
being
the
day
after
his
alleged
death.
Are
you
prepared
to
swear
to
this
handwriting,
Miss
Morton?
Miss
Morton:
Certainly.
Mr.
Humphrey:
I
am
prepared
to
call
six
other
witnesses,
my
lord,
to
testify
that
this
letter
is
in
the
writing
of
Doctor
Lana.
The
Judge:
Then
you
must
call
them
tomorrow.
Mr.
Porlock
Carr
(counsel
for
the
prosecution):
In
the
meantime,
my
lord,
we
claim
possession
of
this
document,
so
that
we
may
obtain
expert
evidence
as
to
how
far
it
is
an
imitation
of
the
handwriting
