was
nothing
for
it
but
to
submit.
I
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
sat
down
in
the
arm
chair
beside
the
empty
fireplace.
"I
am
to
remain
on
watch,
then?"
said
I,
ruefully.
"We
will
divide
the
night.
If
you
will
watch
until
two,
I
will
watch
the
remainder."
"Very
good."
"Call
me
at
two
o'clock,
then."
"I
will
do
so."
"Keep
your
ears
open,
and
if
you
hear
any
sounds
wake
me
instantly
instantly,
you
hear?"
"You
can
rely
upon
it."
I
tried
to
look
as
solemn
as
he
did.
"And
for
God's
sake
don't
go
to
sleep,"
said
he,
and
so,
taking
off
only
his
coat,
he
threw
the
coverlet
over
him
and
settled
down
for
the
night.
It
was
a
melancholy
vigil,
and
made
more
so
by
my
own
sense
of
its
folly.
Supposing
that
by
any
chance
Lord
Linchmere
had
cause
to
suspect
that
he
was
subject
to
danger
in
the
house
of
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter,
why
on
earth
could
he
not
lock
his
door
and
so
protect
himself?
His
own
answer
that
he
might
wish
to
be
attacked
was
absurd.
Why
should
he
possibly
wish
to
be
attacked?
And
who
would
wish
to
attack
him?
Clearly,
