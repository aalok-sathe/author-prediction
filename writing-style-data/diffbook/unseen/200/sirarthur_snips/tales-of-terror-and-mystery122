into
the
obscure
depths
of
the
cavern,
I
hurried
in
the
direction
of
the
Roman
passage.
As
I
did
so
I
passed
the
patch
of
mud
on
which
I
had
seen
the
huge
imprint.
Now
I
stood
astonished
before
it,
for
there
were
three
similar
imprints
upon
its
surface,
enormous
in
size,
irregular
in
outline,
of
a
depth
which
indicated
the
ponderous
weight
which
had
left
them.
Then
a
great
terror
surged
over
me.
Stooping
and
shading
my
candle
with
my
hand,
I
ran
in
a
frenzy
of
fear
to
the
rocky
archway,
hastened
up
it,
and
never
stopped
until,
with
weary
feet
and
panting
lungs,
I
rushed
up
the
final
slope
of
stones,
broke
through
the
tangle
of
briars,
and
flung
myself
exhausted
upon
the
soft
grass
under
the
peaceful
light
of
the
stars.
It
was
three
in
the
morning
when
I
reached
the
farm
house,
and
today
I
am
all
unstrung
and
quivering
after
my
terrific
adventure.
As
yet
I
have
told
no
one.
I
must
move
warily
in
the
matter.
What
would
the
poor
lonely
women,
or
the
uneducated
yokels
here
think
of
it
if
I
were
to
tell
them
my
experience?
Let
me
go
to
someone
