supplied
exactly
one
of
those
missing
links
of
social
development
which
are
of
such
interest
to
the
student.
It
was
the
German
who
had
brought
them
in,
and
the
Englishman's
eyes
were
hungry
as
he
looked
at
them.
"I
won't
interfere
with
your
treasure
trove,
but
I
should
very
much
like
to
hear
about
it,"
he
continued,
while
Burger
very
deliberately
lit
a
cigar.
"It
is
evidently
a
discovery
of
the
first
importance.
These
inscriptions
will
make
a
sensation
throughout
Europe."
"For
every
one
here
there
are
a
million
there!"
said
the
German.
"There
are
so
many
that
a
dozen
savants
might
spend
a
lifetime
over
them,
and
build
up
a
reputation
as
solid
as
the
Castle
of
St.
Angelo."
Kennedy
sat
thinking
with
his
fine
forehead
wrinkled
and
his
fingers
playing
with
his
long,
fair
moustache.
"You
have
given
yourself
away,
Burger!"
said
he
at
last.
"Your
words
can
only
apply
to
one
thing.
You
have
discovered
a
new
catacomb."
"I
had
no
doubt
that
you
had
already
come
to
that
conclusion
from
an
examination
of
these
objects."
"Well,
they
certainly
appeared
to
indicate
it,
but
your
last
remarks
make
it
certain.
There
is
no
place
except
a
catacomb
