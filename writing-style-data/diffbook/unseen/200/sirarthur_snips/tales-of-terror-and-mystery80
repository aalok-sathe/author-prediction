cried
Kennedy
in
an
ecstasy,
as
Burger
swung
his
lantern
over
the
marble.
"It
is
a
Christian
altar
probably
the
first
one
in
existence.
Here
is
the
little
consecration
cross
cut
upon
the
corner
of
it.
No
doubt
this
circular
space

Bring

for

all."
But
the
German
had
strolled
away,
and
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
yellow

of
the
hall.
"Do

he
asked.
"There
