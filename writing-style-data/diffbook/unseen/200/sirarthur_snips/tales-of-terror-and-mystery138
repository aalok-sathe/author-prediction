say
that
it
is
impossible.
My
view
is
and
it
was
formed,
as
is
shown
by
my
diary,
before
my
personal
adventure
that
in
this
part
of
England
there
is
a
vast
subterranean
lake
or
sea,
which
is
fed
by
the
great
number
of
streams
which
pass
down
through
the
limestone.
Where
there
is
a
large
collection
of
water
there
must
also
be
some
evaporation,
mists
or
rain,
and
a
possibility
of
vegetation.
This
in
turn
suggests
that
there
may
be
animal
life,
arising,
as
the
vegetable
life
would
also
do,
from
those
seeds
and
types
which
had
been
introduced
at
an
early
period
of
the
world's
history,
when
communication
with
the
outer
air
was
more
easy.
This
place
had
then
developed
a
fauna
and
flora
of
its
own,
including
such
monsters
as
the
one
which
I
had
seen,
which
may
well
have
been
the
old
cave
bear,
enormously
enlarged
and
modified
by
its
new
environment.
For
countless
aeons
the
internal
and
the
external
creation
had
kept
apart,
growing
steadily
away
from
each
other.
Then
there
had
come
some
rift
in
the
depths
of
the
mountain
which
had
enabled
one
creature
to
wander
up
and,
