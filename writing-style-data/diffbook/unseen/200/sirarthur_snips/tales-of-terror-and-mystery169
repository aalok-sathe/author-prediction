presence
had
been
forgotten
or
ignored.
At
last
the
least
faint
glimmer
of
light
came
through
the
windows
I
first
dimly
saw
them
as
two
grey
squares
upon
the
black
wall,
then
grey
turned
to
white,
and
I
could
see
my
terrible
companion
once
more.
And
he,
alas,
could
see
me!
It
was
evident
to
me
at
once
that
he
was
in
a
much
more
dangerous
and
aggressive
mood
than
when
I
had
seen
him
last.
The
cold
of
the
morning
had
irritated
him,
and
he
was
hungry
as
well.
With
a
continual
growl
he
paced
swiftly
up
and
down
the
side
of
the
room
which
was
farthest
from
my
refuge,
his
whiskers
bristling
angrily,
and
his
tail
switching
and
lashing.
As
he
turned
at
the
corners
his
savage
eyes
always
looked
upwards
at
me
with
a
dreadful
menace.
I
knew
then
that
he
meant
to
kill
me.
Yet
I
found
myself
even
at
that
moment
admiring
the
sinuous
grace
of
the
devilish
thing,
its
long,
undulating,
rippling
movements,
the
gloss
of
its
beautiful
flanks,
the
vivid,
palpitating
scarlet
of
the
glistening
tongue
which
hung
from
the
jet
black
muzzle.
And
all
the
time
that
deep,
threatening
growl
was
rising
