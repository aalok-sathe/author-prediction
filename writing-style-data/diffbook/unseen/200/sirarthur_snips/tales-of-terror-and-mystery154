Sometimes
I
imagined
that
it
must
be
the
Turf,
and
sometimes
the
Stock
Exchange,
but
certainly
he
had
some
very
urgent
business
going
forwards
which
was
not
transacted
upon
the
Downs
of
Suffolk.
During
the
six
days
of
my
visit
he
had
never
fewer
than
three
or
four
telegrams
a
day,
and
sometimes
as
many
as
seven
or

I
had
occupied
these
six
days
so
well,
that
by
the
end
of
them
I
had
succeeded
in
getting
upon

own
reminiscences
of
London
life,
which
interested
him
so
much,
that
he
vowed
he
would
come
up
to
Grosvenor
Mansions
and
stay
with
me.
He
was
anxious
to
see
the
faster
side
of
city
life,
and
certainly,
though
I
say
it,
he
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
competent
guide.
It
was
not
until
the
last
day
of
my
visit
