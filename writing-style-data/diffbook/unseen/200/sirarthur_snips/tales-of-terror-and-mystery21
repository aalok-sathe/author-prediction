is
very
clear
to
me
that
the
insensibility
which
came
upon
Glaisher,
and
in
a
lesser
degree
upon
Coxwell,
when,
in
1862,
they
ascended
in
a
balloon
to
the
height
of
thirty
thousand
feet,
was
due
to
the
extreme
speed
with
which
a
perpendicular
ascent
is
made.
Doing
it
at
an
easy
gradient
and
accustoming
oneself
to
the
lessened
barometric
pressure
by
slow
degrees,
there
are
no
such
dreadful
symptoms.
At
the
same
great
height
I
found
that
even
without
my
oxygen
inhaler
I
could
breathe
without
undue
distress.
It
was
bitterly
cold,
however,
and
my
thermometer
was
at
zero,
Fahrenheit.
At
one
thirty
I
was
nearly
seven
miles
above
the
surface
of
the
earth,
and
still
ascending
steadily.
I
found,
however,
that
the
rarefied
air
was
giving
markedly
less
support
to
my
planes,
and
that
my
angle
of
ascent
had
to
be
considerably
lowered
in
consequence.
It
was
already
clear
that
even
with
my
light
weight
and
strong
engine
power
there
was
a
point
in
front
of
me
where
I
should
be
held.
To
make
matters
worse,
one
of
my
sparking
plugs
was
in
trouble
again
and
there
was
intermittent
misfiring
in
the
engine.
My
heart
was
heavy
with
