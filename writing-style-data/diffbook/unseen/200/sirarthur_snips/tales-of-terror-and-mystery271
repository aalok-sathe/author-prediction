fleeced
of
a
large
sum
by
two
confederate
card
sharpers,
and
the
matter
was
in
the
hands
of
Scotland
Yard.
The
first
I
learned
of
it
was
in
the
evening
paper,
and
I
was
at
once
certain
that
my
brother
and
MacCoy
were
back
at
their
old
games.
I
hurried
at
once
to
Edward's
lodgings.
They
told
me
that
he
and
a
tall
gentleman
(whom
I
recognized
as
MacCoy)
had
gone
off
together,
and
that
he
had
left
the
lodgings
and
taken
his
things
with
him.
The
landlady
had
heard
them
give
several
directions
to
the
cabman,
ending
with
Euston
Station,
and
she
had
accidentally
overheard
the
tall
gentleman
saying
something
about
Manchester.
She
believed
that
that
was
their
destination.
"A
glance
at
the
time
table
showed
me
that
the
most
likely
train
was
at
five,
though
there
was
another
at
4:35
which
they
might
have
caught.
I
had
only
time
to
get
the
later
one,
but
found
no
sign
of
them
either
at
the
depot
or
in
the
train.
They
must
have
gone
on
by
the
earlier
one,
so
I
determined
to
follow
them
to
Manchester
and
search
for
them
in
the
hotels
there.
