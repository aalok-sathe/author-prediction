His
reading
table
was
on
his
right,
and
the
strong
lamp
above
it
ringed
it
with
a
very
vivid
circle
of
golden
light.
A
half
rolled
palimpsest
lay
in
the
centre,
and
around
it
were
many
quaint
articles
of
bric
a
brac.
One
of
these
was
a
large
funnel,
such
as
is
used
for
filling
wine
casks.
It
appeared
to
be
made
of
black
wood,
and
to
be
rimmed
with
discoloured
brass.
"That
is
a
curious
thing,"
I
remarked.
"What

the
history

that?"
"Ah!"
said
he,
"it
is

Take
it
in

that
what
I
had
imagined
to
be
wood
was
in
reality
leather,
though
age
had
dried
it
into
an
extreme
hardness.
It
was
a
large
funnel,
and
might
hold
a
quart
when
full.
The
brass
rim
encircled
the
wide
end,
but
the
narrow
was
also
tipped
with
metal.
"What
do
you
make
of
it?"
asked
Dacre.
"I
should
imagine
that
it
belonged
to
some
vintner
or
maltster
in
the
Middle
Ages,"
said
I.
