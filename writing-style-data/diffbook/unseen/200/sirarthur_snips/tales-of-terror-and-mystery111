Armitage's
explanation
is
too
absurd
for
discussion,
and
yet
that
sound
was
certainly
very
strange.
It
still
rings
in
my
ears
as
I
write.
April
20.
In
the
last
three
days
I
have
made
several
expeditions
to
the
Blue
John
Gap,
and
have
even
penetrated
some
short
distance,
but
my
bicycle
lantern
is
so
small
and
weak
that
I
dare
not
trust
myself
very
far.
I
shall
do
the
thing
more
systematically.
I
have
heard
no
sound
at
all,
and
could
almost
believe
that
I
had
been
the
victim
of
some
hallucination
suggested,
perhaps,
by
Armitage's
conversation.
Of
course,
the
whole
idea
is
absurd,
and
yet
I
must
confess
that
those
bushes
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
do
present
an
appearance
as
if
some
heavy
creature
had
forced
its
way
through
them.
I
begin
to
be
keenly
interested.
I
have
said
nothing
to
the
Miss
Allertons,
for
they
are
quite
superstitious
enough
already,
but
I
have
bought
some
candles,
and
mean
to
investigate
for
myself.
I
observed
this
morning
that
among
the
numerous
tufts
of
sheep's
wool
which
lay
among
the
bushes
near
the
cavern
there
was
one
which
was
smeared
with
blood.
Of
course,
my
reason
tells
me
