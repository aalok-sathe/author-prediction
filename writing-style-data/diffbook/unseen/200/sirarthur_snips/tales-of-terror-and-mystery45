which
respond
readily
to
any
impression."
"I
have
never
tested
myself
in
that
direction."
"Then
we
shall
test
you
tonight.
Might
I
ask
you
as
a
very
great
favour,
when
you
occupy
that
couch
tonight,
to
sleep
with
this
old
funnel
placed
by
the
side
of
your
pillow?"
The
request
seemed
to
me
a
grotesque
one;
but
I
have
myself,
in
my
complex
nature,
a
hunger
after
all
which

and
fantastic.
I

I
sat
for
some
little
time
smoking
by
the
smouldering
fire,
and
turning
over
in
my
mind
the
curious
incident
which
had
occurred,
and
the
strange
experience
which
might
lie
before
me.
Sceptical
as
I
was,
there
was
something
impressive
in
the
assurance
of
Dacre's
manner,
and
my
extraordinary
surroundings,
the
huge
room
with
the
strange
and
often
sinister
objects
which
were
hung
round
it,
