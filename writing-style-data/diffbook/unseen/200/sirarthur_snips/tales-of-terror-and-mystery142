only
get
on
terms
with
this
unknown
relative
of
mine,
I
might
pull
through
yet.
For
the
family
credit
he
could
not
let
me
go
entirely
to
the
wall.
I
ordered
my
valet
to
pack
my
valise,
and
I
set
off
the
same
evening
for
Clipton
on
the
Marsh.
After
changing
at
Ipswich,
a
little
local
train
deposited
me
at
a
small,
deserted
station
lying
amidst
a
rolling
grassy
country,
with
a
sluggish
and
winding
river
curving
in
and
out
amidst
the
valleys,
between
high,
silted
banks,
which
showed
that
we
were
within
reach
of
the
tide.
No
carriage
was
awaiting
me
(I
found
afterwards
that
my
telegram
had
been
delayed),
so
I
hired
a
dogcart
at
the
local
inn.
The
driver,
an
excellent
fellow,
was
full
of
my
relative's
praises,
and
I
learned
from
him
that
Mr.
Everard
King
was
already
a
name
to
conjure
with
in
that
part
of
the
county.
He
had
entertained
the
school
children,
he
had
thrown
his
grounds
open
to
visitors,
he
had
subscribed
to
charities
in
short,
his
benevolence
had
been
so
universal
that
my
driver
could
only
account
for
it
on
the
supposition
that
he
had
parliamentary
ambitions.
My
attention
was
drawn
