was
given
to
her.
Mrs.
Woods
looked
at
the
clock
as
she
returned
to
her
room,
and
it
was
then
half
past
eleven.
At
some
period
between
eleven
and
twelve
(she
could
not
be
positive
as
to
the
exact
hour)
a
patient
called
upon
the
doctor
and
was
unable
to
get
any
reply
from
him.
This
late
visitor
was
Mrs.
Madding,
the
wife
of
the
village
grocer,
who
was
dangerously
ill
of
typhoid
fever.
Dr.
Lana
had
asked
her
to
look
in
the
last
thing
and
let
him
know
how
her
husband
was
progressing.
She
observed
that
the
light
was
burning
in
the
study,
but
having
knocked
several
times
at
the
surgery
door
without
response,
she
concluded
that
the
doctor
had
been
called
out,
and
so
returned
home.
There
is
a
short,
winding
drive
with
a
lamp
at
the
end
of
it
leading
down
from
the
house
to
the
road.
As
Mrs.
Madding
emerged
from
the
gate
a
man
was
coming
along
the
footpath.
Thinking
that
it
might
be
Dr.
Lana
returning
from
some
professional
visit,
she
waited
for
him,
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
Mr.
Arthur
Morton,
the
young
squire.
In
the
light
of
the
lamp
