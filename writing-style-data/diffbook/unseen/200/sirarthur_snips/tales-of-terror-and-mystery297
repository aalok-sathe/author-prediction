had
you
done?"
"Done,
sir!
Nothing.
At
least
nothing
to
make
so
much
of.
Just
laid
my
'and
on
that
black
box
of
'is
'adn't
even
opened
it,
when
in
'e
came
and
you
'eard
the
way
'e
went
on.
I've
lost
my
place,
and
glad
I
am
of
it,
for
I
would
never
trust
myself
within
reach
of
'im
again."
So
it
was
the
japanned
box
which
was
the
cause
of
this
outburst
the
box
from
which
he
would
never
permit
himself
to
be
separated.
What
was
the
connection,
or
was
there
any
connection
between
this
and
the
secret
visits
of
the
lady
whose
voice
I
had
overheard?
Sir
John
Bollamore's
wrath
was
enduring
as
well
as
fiery,
for
from
that
day
Mrs.
Brown,
the
charwoman,
vanished
from
our
ken,
and
Thorpe
Place
knew
her
no
more.
And
now
I
wish
to
tell
you
the
singular
chance
which
solved
all
these
strange
questions
and
put
my
employer's
secret
in
my
possession.
The
story
may
leave
you
with
some
lingering
doubts
as
to
whether
my
curiosity
did
not
get
the
better
of
my
honour,
and
whether
I
did
not
condescend
to
play
the
spy.
If
you
choose
to
think
so
