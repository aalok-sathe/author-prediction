nor
was
there
any
sign
of
the
brown
leather
bag
which
the
guard
had
seen
in
the
hand
of
the
tall
gentleman.
A
lady's
parasol
was
found
upon
the
rack,
but
no
other
trace
was
to
be
seen
of
the
travellers
in
either
of
the
sections.
Apart
from
the
crime,
the
question
of
how
or
why
three
passengers
(one
of
them
a
lady)
could
get
out
of
the
train,
and
one
other
get
in
during
the
unbroken
run
between
Willesden
and
Rugby,
was
one
which
excited
the
utmost
curiosity
among
the
general
public,
and
gave
rise
to
much
speculation
in
the
London
Press.
John
Palmer,
the
guard
was
able
at
the
inquest
to
give
some
evidence
which
threw
a
little
light
upon
the
matter.
There
was
a
spot
between
Tring
and
Cheddington,
according
to
his
statement,
where,
on
account
of
some
repairs
to
the
line,
the
train
had
for
a
few
minutes
slowed
down
to
a
pace
not
exceeding
eight
or
ten
miles
an
hour.
At
that
place
it
might
be
possible
for
a
man,
or
even
for
an
exceptionally
active
woman,
to
have
left
the
train
without
serious
injury.
It
was
