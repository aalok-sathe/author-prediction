blackest
darkness.
Turn
it
on,
and
it
is
a
scene
from
the
Arabian
Nights.
But
there
is
one
of
these
strange
openings
in
the
earth
which
has
a
special
interest,
for
it
is
the
handiwork,
not
of
nature,
but
of
man.
I
had
never
heard
of
Blue
John
when
I
came
to
these
parts.
It
is
the
name
given
to
a
peculiar
mineral
of
a
beautiful
purple
shade,
which
is
only
found
at
one
or
two
places
in
the
world.
It
is
so
rare
that
an
ordinary
vase
of
Blue
John
would
be
valued
at
a
great
price.
The
Romans,
with
that
extraordinary
instinct
of
theirs,
discovered
that
it
was
to
be
found
in
this
valley,
and
sank
a
horizontal
shaft
deep
into
the
mountain
side.
The
opening
of
their
mine
has
been
called
Blue
John
Gap,
a
clean
cut
arch
in
the
rock,
the
mouth
all
overgrown
with
bushes.
It
is
a
goodly
passage
which
the
Roman
miners
have
cut,
and
it
intersects
some
of
the
great
water
worn
caves,
so
that
if
you
enter
Blue
John
Gap
you
would
do
well
to
mark
your
steps
and
to
have
a
good
store
of
candles,
or
you
may
never
make
