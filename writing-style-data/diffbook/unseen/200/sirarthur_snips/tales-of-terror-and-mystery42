a
B."
"But
the
nobleman
you
mentioned
would
have
had
R
for
his
initial."
"Exactly!
That's
the
beauty
of
it.
He
owned
this
curious
object,
and
yet
he
had
someone
else's
initials
upon
it.
Why
did
he
do
this?"
"I
can't
imagine;
can
you?"
"Well,
I
might,
perhaps,
guess.
Do
you
observe
something
drawn
a
little
farther
along
the
rim?"
"I
should
say
it
was
a
crown."
"It
is
undoubtedly
a
crown;
but
if
you
examine
it
in
a
good
light,
you
will
convince
yourself
that
it
is
not
an
ordinary
crown.
It
is
a
heraldic
crown
a
badge
of
rank,
and
it
consists
of
an
alternation
of
four
pearls
and
strawberry
leaves,
the
proper
badge
of
a
marquis.
We
may
infer,
therefore,
that
the
person
whose
initials
end
in
B
was
entitled
to
wear
that
coronet."
"Then
this
common
leather
filler
belonged
to
a
marquis?"
Dacre
gave
a
peculiar
smile.
"Or
to
some
member
of
the
family
of
a
marquis,"
said
he.
"So
much
we
have
clearly
gathered
from
this
engraved
rim."
"But
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
dreams?"
I
do
not
know
whether
it
was
from
a
look
upon
Dacre's
face,
or
from
some
subtle
suggestion
