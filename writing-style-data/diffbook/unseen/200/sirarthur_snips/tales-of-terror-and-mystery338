It
may
be
that
I
was
unduly
sensitive,
and
that
I
had
not
made
sufficient
allowance
for
others,
but
my
feelings
were
as
I
describe.
Any
chance
of
getting
away
from
Bishop's
Crossing
and
of
everyone
in
it
would
be
most
welcome
to
me.
And
here
was
such
a
chance
as
I
could
never
have
dared
to
hope
for,
a
chance
which
would
enable
me
to
make
a
clean
break
with
the
past.
"There
was
this
dead
man
lying
upon
the
sofa,
so
like
me
that
save
for
some
little
thickness
and
coarseness
of
the
features
there
was
no
difference
at
all.
No
one
had
seen
him
come
and
no
one
would
miss
him.
We
were
both
clean
shaven,
and
his
hair
was
about
the
same
length
as
my
own.
If
I
changed
clothes
with
him,
then
Dr.
Aloysius
Lana
would
be
found
lying
dead
in
his
study,
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
an
unfortunate
fellow,
and
of
a
blighted
career.
There
was
plenty
of
ready
money
in
the
room,
and
this
I
could
carry
away
with
me
to
help
me
to
start
once
more
in
some
other
land.
In
my
brother's
clothes
I
could
walk
by
night
