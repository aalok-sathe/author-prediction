instant
won't
you?"
He
passed
out,
and
the
door
shut
with
a
sharp
metallic
click
behind
him.
That
hard
crisp
sound
made
my
heart
stand
still.
A
sudden
wave
of
terror
passed
over
me.
A
vague
perception
of
some
monstrous
treachery
turned
me
cold.
I
sprang
to
the
door,
but
there
was
no
handle
upon
the
inner
side.
"Here!"
I
cried.
"Let
me
out!"
"All
right!
Don't
make

said
he,
with
another
hateful
chuckle.
And
then
suddenly
I
heard,
amidst
the
roar
of
the
storm,
the
creak
and
whine
of
the
winch
handle
turning
and
the
rattle
of
the
grating
as
it
passed
through
the
slot.
Great
God,
he
was
letting
loose
the
Brazilian
cat!
In
the
light
of
the
lantern
I
saw
the
bars
sliding
slowly
before
me.
Already
there
was
an
opening
a
foot
wide
at
the
