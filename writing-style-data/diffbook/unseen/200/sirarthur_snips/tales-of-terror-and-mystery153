and
wrenched
at
it,
raising
his
bloody
muzzle
every
now
and
then
to
look
at
us.
It
was
a
malignant
and
yet
fascinating
sight.
"You
can't
wonder
that
I
am
fond
of
him,
can
you?"
said
my
host,
as
we
left
the
room,
"especially
when
you
consider
that
I
have
had
the
rearing
of
him.
It
was
no
joke
bringing
him
over
from
the
centre
of
South
America;
but
here
he
is
safe
and
sound
and,
as
I
have
said,
far
the
most
perfect
specimen
in
Europe.
The
people
at
the
Zoo
are
dying
to
have
him,
but
I
really
can't
part
with
him.
Now,
I
think
that
I
have
inflicted
my
hobby
upon
you
long
enough,
so
we
cannot
do
better
than
follow
Tommy's
example,
and
go
to
our
lunch."
My
South
American
relative
was
so
engrossed
by
his
grounds
and
their
curious
occupants,
that
I
hardly
gave
him
credit
at
first
for
having
any
interests
outside
them.
That
he
had
some,
and
pressing
ones,
was
soon
borne
in
upon
me
by
the
number
of
telegrams
which
he
received.
They
arrived
at
all
hours,
and
were
always
opened
by
him
with
the
utmost
eagerness
and
anxiety
upon
his
face.
