solemnity
into
my
soul.
Finally
I
undressed,
and
turning
out
the
lamp,
I
lay
down.
After
long
tossing
I
fell
asleep.
Let
me
try
to
describe
as
accurately
as
I
can
the
scene
which
came
to
me
in
my
dreams.
It
stands
out
now
in
my
memory
more
clearly
than
anything
which
I
have
seen
with
my
waking
eyes.
There
was
a
room
which
bore
the
appearance
of
a
vault.
Four
spandrels
from
the
corners
ran
up
to
join
a
sharp,
cup
shaped
roof.
The
architecture
was
rough,
but
very
strong.
It
was
evidently
part
of
a
great
building.
Three
men
in
black,
with
curious,
top
heavy,
black
velvet
hats,
sat
in
a
line
upon
a
red
carpeted
dais.
Their
faces
were
very
solemn
and
sad.
On
the
left
stood
two
long
gowned
men
with
port
folios
in
their
hands,
which
seemed
to
be
stuffed
with
papers.
Upon
the
right,
looking
toward
me,
was
a
small
woman
with
blonde
hair
and
singular,
light
blue
eyes
the
eyes
of
a
child.
She
was
past
her
first
youth,
but
could
not
yet
be
called
middle
aged.
Her
figure
was
inclined
to
stoutness
and
her
bearing
was
proud
and
confident.
Her
face
was
