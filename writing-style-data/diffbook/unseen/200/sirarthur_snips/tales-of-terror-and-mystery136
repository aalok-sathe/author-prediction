Johnsons
and
the
like,
may
smile
at
my
narrative,
but
the
poorer
folk
of
the
countryside
had
never
a
doubt
as
to
its
truth.
On
the
day
after
my
recovering
consciousness
they
assembled
in
their
hundreds
round
the
Blue
John
Gap.
As
the
Castleton
Courier
said:
"It
was
useless
for
our
correspondent,
or
for
any
of
the
adventurous
gentlemen
who
had
come
from
Matlock,
Buxton,
and
other
parts,
to
offer
to
descend,
to
explore
the
cave
to
the
end,
and
to
finally
test
the
extraordinary
narrative
of
Dr.
James
Hardcastle.
The
country
people
had
taken
the
matter
into
their
own
hands,
and
from
an
early
hour
of
the
morning
they
had
worked
hard
in
stopping
up
the
entrance
of
the
tunnel.
There
is
a
sharp
slope
where
the
shaft
begins,
and
great
boulders,
rolled
along
by
many
willing
hands,
were
thrust
down
it
until
the
Gap
was
absolutely
sealed.
So
ends
the
episode
which
has
caused
such
excitement
throughout
the
country.
Local
opinion
is
fiercely
divided
upon
the
subject.
On
the
one
hand
are
those
who
point
to
Dr.
Hardcastle's
impaired
health,
and
to
the
possibility
of
cerebral
lesions
of
tubercular
origin
giving
rise
to
strange
hallucinations.
Some
idee
fixe,
