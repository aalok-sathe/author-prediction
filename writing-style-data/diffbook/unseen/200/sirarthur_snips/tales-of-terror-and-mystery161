farther
end.
With
a
scream
I
seized
the
last
bar
with
my
hands
and
pulled
with
the
strength
of
a
madman.
I
WAS
a
madman
with
rage
and
horror.
For
a
minute
or
more
I
held
the
thing
motionless.
I
knew
that
he
was
straining
with
all
his
force
upon
the
handle,
and
that
the
leverage
was
sure
to
overcome
me.
I
gave
inch
by
inch,
my
feet
sliding
along
the
stones,
and
all
the
time
I
begged
and
prayed
this
inhuman
monster
to
save
me
from
this
horrible
death.
I
conjured
him
by
his
kinship.
I
reminded
him
that
I
was
his
guest;
I
begged
to
know
what
harm
I
had
ever
done
him.
His
only
answers
were
the
tugs
and
jerks
upon
the
handle,
each
of
which,
in
spite
of
all
my
struggles,
pulled
another
bar
through
the
opening.
Clinging
and
clutching,
I
was
dragged
across
the
whole
front
of
the
cage,
until
at
last,
with
aching
wrists
and
lacerated
fingers,
I
gave
up
the
hopeless
struggle.
The
grating
clanged
back
as
I
released
it,
and
an
instant
later
I
heard
the
shuffle
of
the
Turkish
slippers
in
the
passage,
and
the
slam
of
the
distant
door.
Then
