the
monster
to
walk.
About
eleven
o'clock
I
went
from
the
farm
house
with
my
lantern
and
my
rifle,
having
first
left
a
note
upon
the
table
of
my
bedroom
in
which
I
said
that,
if
I
were
missing,
search
should
be
made
for
me
in
the
direction
of
the
Gap.
I
made
my
way
to
the
mouth
of
the
Roman
shaft,
and,
having
perched
myself
among
the
rocks
close
to
the
opening,
I
shut
off
my
lantern
and
waited
patiently
with
my
loaded
rifle
ready
to
my
hand.
It
was
a
melancholy
vigil.
All
down
the
winding
valley
I
could
see
the
scattered
lights
of
the
farm
houses,
and
the
church
clock
of
Chapel
le
Dale
tolling
the
hours
came
faintly
to
my
ears.
These
tokens
of
my
fellow
men
served
only
to
make
my
own
position
seem
the
more
lonely,
and
to
call
for
a
greater
effort
to
overcome
the
terror
which
tempted
me
continually
to
get
back
to
the
farm,
and
abandon
for
ever
this
dangerous
quest.
And
yet
there
lies
deep
in
every
man
a
rooted
self
respect
which
makes
it
hard
for
him
to
turn
back
from
that
which
he
has
once
undertaken.
This
feeling
