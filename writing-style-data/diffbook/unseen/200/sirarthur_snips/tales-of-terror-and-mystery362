that
it
would
be
impossible
for
anyone
looking
up
from
below
to
detect
that
he
was
overlooked.
We
cleared
a
small
piece
at
each
corner,
which
gave
us
a
complete
view
of
the
room
beneath
us.
In
the
cold
white
light
of
the
electric
lamps
everything
stood
out
hard
and
clear,
and
I
could
see
the
smallest
detail
of
the
contents
of
the
various
cases.
Such
a
vigil
is
an
excellent
lesson,
since
one
has
no
choice

to
look
hard
at
those
objects
which

usually
pass

had
brought

beneath

stones
scattered
through
the
numerous
cases,

those
wonderful

which
made
up
the
urim
and
thummim
glowed
and
burned
with
a
radiance
which
far
eclipsed
the
others.
I
studied
in
turn
the
tomb
pictures
of
Sicara,
the
friezes
from
Karnak,
the
statues

Memphis,
and
the
inscriptions
of
