ring
for
ever
in
my
ears.
It
came
with
a
curious
faraway
tinkle,
but
every
word
was
clear,
though
faint
very
faint,
for
they
were
the
last
words
of
a
dying
woman.
"I
am
not
really
gone,
John,"
said
the
thin,
gasping
voice.
"I
am
here
at
your
very
elbow,
and
shall
be
until
we
meet
once
more.
I
die
happy
to
think
that
morning
and
night
you
will
hear
my
voice.
Oh,
John,
be
strong,
be
strong,
until
we
meet
again."
I
say
that
I
had
risen
in
order
to
announce
my
presence,
but
I
could
not
do
so
while
the
voice
was
sounding.
I
could
only
remain
half
lying,
half
sitting,
paralysed,
astounded,
listening
to
those
yearning
distant
musical
words.
And
he

was
so
absorbed
that
even
if
I
had
spoken
he
might
not
have
heard
me.
But
with
the
silence
of
the
voice
came
my
half
articulated
apologies
and
explanations.
He
sprang
across
the
room,
switched
on
the
electric
light,
and
in
its
white
glare
I
saw
him,
his
eyes
gleaming
with
anger,
his
face
twisted
with
passion,
as
the
hapless
charwoman
may
have
seen
him
weeks
before.
"Mr.
Colmore!"
he
cried.
"You
here!
What
