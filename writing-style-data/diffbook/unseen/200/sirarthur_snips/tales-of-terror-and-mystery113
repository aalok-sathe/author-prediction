companion
to
share
my
exploration.
Finally,
with
a
return
of
resolution,
I
lit
my
candle,
pushed
my
way
through
the
briars,
and
descended
into
the
rocky
shaft.
It
went
down
at
an
acute
angle
for
some
fifty
feet,
the
floor
being
covered
with
broken
stone.
Thence
there
extended
a
long,
straight
passage
cut
in
the
solid
rock.
I
am
no
geologist,
but
the
lining
of
this
corridor
was
certainly
of
some
harder
material
than
limestone,
for
there
were
points
where
I
could
actually
see

and
obscure.
Finally,
I
came
to
a
spot
where
the
Roman
tunnel
opened
into
a
water
worn
cavern
a
huge
hall,
hung
with
long
white
icicles
of
lime
deposit.
From
this
central
chamber
I
could
dimly
perceive
that
a
number
of
passages
worn
by
the
subterranean
streams
wound
away
into
the
depths
of
the
earth.
I
was
standing
there
wondering
whether
I
had
