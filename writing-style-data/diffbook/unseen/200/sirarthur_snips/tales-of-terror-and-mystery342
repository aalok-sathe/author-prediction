That
another
reconciliation
followed
may
be
judged
from
a
notice
extracted
from
a
prominent
column
in
the
Morning
Post:
"A
marriage
was
solemnized
upon
September
19th,
by
the
Rev.
Stephen
Johnson,
at
the
parish
church
of
Bishop's
Crossing,
between
Aloysius
Xavier
Lana,
son
of
Don
Alfredo
Lana,
formerly
Foreign
Minister
of
the
Argentine
Republic,
and
Frances
Morton,

daughter
of
the
late
James
Morton,
J.P.,
of
Leigh

Bishop's

My
particular
friend,
Ward
Mortimer,

one
of
the
best
men
of
his
day

in
the
inner
room
of
the
Temple
of
Horus,
at
Philae.
With
such
a
record
at
the
age
of
thirty
one,
it
was
felt
that
a
considerable
career
lay
before
him,
and
no
one
was
surprised
when
he
was
elected
to
the
curatorship
of

the
Oriental
College,
and

income
