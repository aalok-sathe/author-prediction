an
impression
upon
his
mind.
But
when
Douglas
Stone
became
the
favourite
all
doubts
as
to
Lord
Sannox's
knowledge
or
ignorance
were
set
for
ever
at
rest.
There
was
no
subterfuge
about
Stone.
In
his
high
handed,
impetuous
fashion,
he
set
all
caution
and
discretion
at
defiance.
The
scandal
became
notorious.
A
learned
body
intimated
that

had
been
struck

dismal
winter's
night,
very
cold
and
gusty,
with
the
wind
whooping
in
the
chimneys
and
blustering
against
the
window
panes.
A
thin
spatter
of
rain
tinkled
on
the
glass
with
each
fresh
sough
of
the
gale,
drowning
for
the
instant
the
dull
gurgle
and
drip
from
the
eaves.
Douglas
Stone
had
finished
