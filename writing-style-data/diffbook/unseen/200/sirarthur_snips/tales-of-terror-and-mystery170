and
rising
in
an
unbroken
crescendo.
I
knew
that
the
crisis
was
at
hand.
It
was
a
miserable
hour
to
meet
such
a
death
so
cold,
so
comfortless,
shivering
in
my
light
dress
clothes
upon
this
gridiron
of
torment
upon
which
I
was
stretched.
I
tried
to
brace
myself
to
it,
to
raise
my
soul
above
it,
and
at

One

I
put
my
hand
forward
until
it
grasped
the
edge
of
the
front,
the
final
bar
which
protruded
through
the
wall.
To
my
surprise
it
came
quite
easily
to
my
jerk.
Of
course
the
difficulty
of
drawing
it
out
arose
from
the
fact
that
I
was
clinging
to
it.
I
pulled
again,
and
three
inches
of
it
came
through.
It
ran
apparently
on
wheels.
I
pulled
again
...
and
