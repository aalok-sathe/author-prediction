how
little
was
ever
done
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
business!
He
came
down
in
a
tremendous
vol
plane
from
an
unknown
height.
He
never
got
off
his
machine
and
died
in
his
pilot's
seat.
Died
of
what?
'Heart
disease,'
said
the
doctors.
Rubbish!
Hay
Connor's
heart
was
as
sound
as
mine
is.
What
did
Venables
say?
Venables
was
the
only
man
who
was
at
his
side
when
he
died.
He
said
that
he
was
shivering
and
looked
like
a
man
who
had
been
badly
scared.
'Died
of
fright,'
said
Venables,
but
could
not
imagine
what
he
was
frightened
about.
Only
said
one
word
to
Venables,
which
sounded
like
'Monstrous.'
They
could
make
nothing
of
that
at
the
inquest.
But
I
could
make
something
of
it.
Monsters!
That
was
the
last
word
of
poor
Harry
Hay
Connor.
And
he
DID
die
of
fright,
just
as
Venables
thought.
"And
then
there
was
Myrtle's
head.
Do
you
really
believe
does
anybody
really
believe
that
a
man's
head
could
be
driven
clean
into
his
body
by
the
force
of
a
fall?
Well,
perhaps
it
may
be
possible,
but
I,
for
one,
have
never
believed
that
it
was
so
with
Myrtle.
And
