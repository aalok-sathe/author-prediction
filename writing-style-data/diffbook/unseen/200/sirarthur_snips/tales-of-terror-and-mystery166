from
some
foul
pot.
It
appeared,
however,
to
be
rather
curious
than
angry.
With
a
sleek
ripple
of
its
long,
black
back
it
rose,
stretched
itself,
and
then
rearing
itself
on
its
hind
legs,
with
one
forepaw
against
the
wall,
it
raised
the
other,
and
drew
its
claws
across
the
wire
meshes
beneath
me.
One
sharp,
white
hook
tore
through
my
trousers
for
I
may
mention
that
I
was
still
in
evening
dress
and
dug
a
furrow
in
my
knee.
It
was
not
meant
as
an
attack,
but
rather
as
an
experiment,
for
upon
my
giving
a
sharp
cry
of
pain
he
dropped
down
again,
and
springing
lightly
into
the
room,
he
began
walking
swiftly
round
it,
looking
up
every
now
and
again
in
my
direction.
For
my
part
I
shuffled
backwards
until
I
lay
with
my
back
against
the
wall,
screwing
myself
into
the
smallest
space
possible.
The
farther
I
got
the
more
difficult
it
was
for
him
to
attack
me.
He
seemed
more
excited
now
that
he
had
begun
to
move
about,
and
he
ran
swiftly
and
noiselessly
round
and
round
the
den,
passing
continually
underneath
the
iron
couch
upon
which
I
lay.
It
was
wonderful
to
see
