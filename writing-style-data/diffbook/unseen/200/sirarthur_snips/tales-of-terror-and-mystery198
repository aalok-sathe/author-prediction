7th

June.
Mrs.
McPherson
and
her
sister
Lizzie
Dolton
went
across
to
New
York
as
directed
and
stayed
for
three
weeks
at
the
Johnston
House,
without
hearing
anything
from
the
missing
man.
It
is
probable
that
some
injudicious
comments
in
the
Press
may
have
warned
him
that
the
police
were
using
them
as
a
bait.
However,
this
may
be,
it
is
certain
that
he
neither
wrote
nor
came,
and
the
women
were
eventually
compelled
to
return
to
Liverpool.
And

the
matter
stood,

has
continued
to
stand
up
to
the
present

upon
the
extraordinary
disappearance
of
the
special
train
which
contained
Monsieur
Caratal
and
his
companion.
Careful
inquiries
into
the
antecedents
of
the
two
travellers
have
only
established
the
fact
that
Monsieur
Caratal
was
well
known
as
a
financier
and
political
agent
in
Central
America,
and
that
during
his
voyage
to
Europe
he
had
betrayed
extraordinary
anxiety
to
reach
Paris.
His
companion,
whose
name
was
entered
upon
the
passenger
lists
as
Eduardo
Gomez,
was
a
man
whose
record
was
a
violent
one,
and
whose
reputation
was
that
