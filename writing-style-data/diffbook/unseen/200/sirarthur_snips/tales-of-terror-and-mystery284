had
his
usually
alone
in
the
library.
Sometimes
he
joined
us
at
dinner,
but
on
the
whole
we
were
just
as
glad
when
he
did
not.
For
he
was
a
very
formidable
person.
Imagine
a
man
six
feet
three
inches
in
height,
majestically
built,
with
a
high
nosed,
aristocratic
face,
brindled
hair,
shaggy
eyebrows,
a
small,
pointed
Mephistophelian
beard,
and
lines
upon
his
brow
and
round
his
eyes
as
deep
as
if
they
had
been
carved
with
a
penknife.
He
had
grey
eyes,
weary,
hopeless
looking
eyes,
proud
and
yet
pathetic,
eyes
which
claimed
your
pity
and
yet
dared
you
to
show
it.
His
back
was
rounded
with
study,
but
otherwise
he
was
as
fine
a
looking
man
of
his
age
five
and
fifty
perhaps
as
any
woman
would
wish
to
look
upon.
But
his
presence
was
not
a
cheerful
one.
He
was
always
courteous,
always
refined,
but
singularly
silent
and
retiring.
I
have
never
lived
so
long
with
any
man
and
known
so
little
of
him.
If
he
were
indoors
he
spent
his
time
either
in
his
own
small
study
in
the
Eastern
Tower,
or
in
the
library
in
the
modern
wing.
So
regular
was
his
routine
that
one
