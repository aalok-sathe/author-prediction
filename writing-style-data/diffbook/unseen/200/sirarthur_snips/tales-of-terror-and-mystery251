the

collar
or
of
the
young
lady
who
accompanied
him.
All
three
passengers
had
disappeared.
On
the
other
hand,
there
was
found
upon
the
floor
of
this
carriage
the
one
in
which
the
tall
traveller
and
the
lady
had
been
a
young
man
fashionably
dressed
and
of
elegant
appearance.
He
lay
with
his
knees
drawn
up,
and
his
head
resting
against
the
farther
door,
an
elbow
upon

A
bullet
had
penetrated
his
heart
and
his
death
must
have
been
instantaneous.
No
one
had

might
help
to
identify
him.
Who
he
was,
whence
he
had
come,
and
how
he
had
met
his
end
were
each
as
great
a
mystery
as

had
occurred
to
the
three
people
who
had
started
an
hour
and
a
half
before
from
Willesden
in
those
two
compartments.
I
have
said
that
there
was
no
personal
property
which
might
help
to
identify
him,
but
it
is
true
that
there
was
one
peculiarity
about
this
unknown
young
man
which
was

commented
