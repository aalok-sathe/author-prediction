carts
of
country
produce
coming
up
to
Rome,
were
the
only
things
which
they
met.
They
swung
along,
with
the
huge
tombs
looming
up
through
the
darkness
upon
each
side
of
them,
until
they
had
come
as
far
as
the
Catacombs
of
St.
Calistus,
and
saw
against
a
rising
moon
the
great
circular
bastion
of
Cecilia
Metella
in
front
of
them.
Then
Burger
stopped
with
his
hand
to
his
side.
"Your
legs
are
longer
than
mine,
and
you
are
more
accustomed
to
walking,"
said
he,
laughing.
"I
think
that
the
place
where
we
turn
off
is
somewhere
here.
Yes,
this
is
it,
round
the
corner
of
the
trattoria.
Now,
it
is
a
very
narrow
path,
so
perhaps
I
had
better
go
in
front
and
you
can
follow."
He
had
lit
his
lantern,
and
by
its
light
they
were
enabled
to
follow
a
narrow
and
devious
track
which
wound
across
the
marshes
of
the
Campagna.
The
great
Aqueduct
of
old
Rome
lay
like
a
monstrous
caterpillar
across
the
moonlit
landscape,
and
their
road
led
them
under
one
of
its
huge
arches,
and
past
the
circle
of
crumbling
bricks
which
marks
the
old
arena.
At
last
Burger
stopped
at
a
solitary
wooden
