of
personal
pride
was
my
salvation
now,
and
it
was
that
alone
which
held
me
fast
when
every
instinct
of
my
nature
was
dragging
me
away.
I
am
glad
now
that
I
had
the
strength.
In
spite
of
all
that
is
has
cost
me,

is

giant
tread.
They
drew

me.
I
heard
the
crashing
of
the
bushes
round
the
entrance,
and
then
dimly
through
the
darkness

was
conscious
of
the
loom
of
some
enormous
