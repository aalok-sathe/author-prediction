and
for
any
other
mishap
which
may
occur?
Surely
with
the
knowledge
I
already
possess
it
must
be
my
duty
to
see
that
something
is
done,
or
if
necessary
to
do
it
myself.
It
must
be
the
latter,
for
this
morning
I
went
down
to
the
local
police
station
and
told
my
story.
The
inspector
entered
it
all
in
a
large
book
and
bowed
me
out
with
commendable
gravity,
but
I
heard
a
burst
of
laughter
before
I
had
got
down
his
garden
path.
No
doubt
he
was

to
his
family.
June
10.
I
am
writing
this,
propped
up
in
bed,
six
weeks
after
my
last
entry
in
this
journal.
I
have
gone
through
a
terrible
shock
both
to
mind
and
body,
arising
from
such
an
experience
as
has
seldom
befallen
a
human
being
before.
But
I
have
attained
my
end.
The
danger
from
the
Terror
which
dwells
in
the
Blue
John
Gap
has
passed
never
to
return.
Thus
much
at
least
I,
a
broken
invalid,
have
done
for
the
common
good.
Let
me
now
recount
what
occurred
as
clearly
as
I
may.
The
night
of
Friday,
May
3rd,
was
dark
and
cloudy
the
very
night
for
