threshold.
A
drop
of
it
would
be
like
blood
to
a
tiger
even
now."
"Then
her
influence
still
holds
him?"
"That
is
the
wonder
of
it.
When
she
died
three
years
ago,
we
all
expected
and
feared
that
he
would
fall
back
into
his
old
ways.
She
feared
it
herself,
and
the
thought
gave
a
terror
to
death,
for
she
was
like
a
guardian
angel
to
that
man,
and
lived
only
for
the
one
purpose.
By
the
way,
did
you
see
a
black
japanned
box
in
his
room?"
"Yes."
"I
fancy
it
contains
her
letters.
If
ever
he
has
occasion
to
be
away,
if
only
for
a
single
night,
he
invariably
takes
his
black
japanned
box
with
him.
Well,
well,
Colmore,
perhaps
I
have
told
you
rather
more
than
I
should,
but
I
shall
expect
you
to
reciprocate
if
anything
of
interest
should
come
to
your
knowledge."
I
could
see
that
the
worthy
man
was
consumed
with
curiosity
and
just
a
little
piqued
that
I,
the
newcomer,
should
have
been
the
first
to
penetrate
into
the
untrodden
chamber.
But
the
fact
raised
me
in
his
esteem,
and
from
that
time
onwards
I
found
myself
upon
more
confidential
terms
with
him.
