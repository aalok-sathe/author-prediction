satisfaction
of
spoiling
his
little
game
for
the
voyage.
The
very
first
night
I
went
into
the
smoking
room,
and
found
him
at
the
head
of
a
card
table,
with
a
half
a
dozen
young
fellows
who
were
carrying
their
full
purses
and
their
empty
skulls
over
to
Europe.
He
was
settling
down
for
his
harvest,
and
a
rich
one
it
would
have
been.
But
I
soon
changed
all

"'Gentlemen,'
said
I,
'are
you
aware
whom
you
are

with?'

he,
with
an

Sparrow
MacCoy,
the
most
notorious
card

his
hand,

that
he
was
under
the
flag
of
the
effete
Old

where
law
and
order
run,
and
Tammany
has
no
pull.
Gaol
and
the
gallows
wait
for
violence
and
murder,
and
there's
no
slipping
out
by
the
back
door
on
board
an
ocean
liner.
"'Prove
your
words,
you
!'
said
he.
"'I
will!'
said
I.
'If
you
will
turn
up
your
right
shirt
sleeve
to
the
shoulder,
I
will
either
prove
my
words
