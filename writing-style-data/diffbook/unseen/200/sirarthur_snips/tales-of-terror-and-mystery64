which
could
contain
so
vast
a
store
of
relics
as
you
describe."
"Quite
so.
There
is
no
mystery
about
that.
I
HAVE
discovered
a
new
catacomb."
"Where?"
"Ah,
that
is
my
secret,
my
dear
Kennedy.
Suffice
it
that
it
is
so
situated
that
there
is
not
one
chance
in
a
million
of
anyone
else
coming
upon
it.
Its
date
is
different
from
that
of
any
known
catacomb,
and
it
has
been
reserved
for
the
burial
of
the
highest
Christians,
so
that
the
remains
and
the
relics
are
quite
different
from
anything
which
has
ever
been
seen
before.
If
I
was
not
aware
of
your
knowledge
and
of
your
energy,
my
friend,
I
would
not
hesitate,
under
the
pledge
of
secrecy,
to
tell
you
everything
about
it.
But
as
it
is
I
think
that
I
must
certainly
prepare
my
own
report
of
the
matter
before
I
expose
myself
to
such
formidable
competition."
Kennedy
loved
his
subject
with
a
love
which
was
almost
a
mania
a
love
which
held
him
true
to
it,
amidst
all
the
distractions
which
come
to
a
wealthy
and
dissipated
young
man.
He
had
ambition,
but
his
ambition
was
secondary
to
his
mere
abstract
joy
and
interest
in
