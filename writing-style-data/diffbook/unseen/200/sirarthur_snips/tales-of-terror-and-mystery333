in
my
early
manhood
I
conceived
a
horror
of
him,
and
that
I
had
good
reason
for
the
aversion
which
filled
me.
My
own
reputation
suffered
from
his
actions,
for
our
close
resemblance
caused
me
to
be
credited
with
many
of
them.
Eventually,
in
a

business,
he
contrived
to
throw

then
at

he
discovered
me.
Some
Liverpool
man
who
visited
Buenos
Ayres
put
him
upon
my
track.
He
had
lost
all
his
money,
and
he
thought
that
he
would
come
over
and
share
mine.
Knowing
my
horror
of
him,
he
rightly
thought
that
I
would
be
willing
to
buy
him

I
received
a
letter
from
him
