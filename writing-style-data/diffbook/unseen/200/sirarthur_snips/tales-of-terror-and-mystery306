her
without
shame
when
He
is
pleased
to
reunite
us!
That
is
my
secret,
Mr.
Colmore,
and
whilst
I
live
I
leave
it
in
your
keeping."
The
Black
Doctor
Bishop's
Crossing
is
a
small
village
lying
ten
miles
in
a
south
westerly
direction
from
Liverpool.
Here
in
the
early
seventies
there
settled
a
doctor
named
Aloysius
Lana.
Nothing
was
known
locally
either
of
his
antecedents
or
of
the
reasons
which
had
prompted
him
to
come
to
this
Lancashire
hamlet.
Two
facts

his
medical
qualification
with
some
distinction
at
Glasgow;
the
other
that
he
came
undoubtedly
of
a
tropical
race,
and
was
so
dark
that
he
might
almost
have
had
a
strain
of
the
Indian
in
his
composition.
His
predominant
features
were,
however,
European,
and
he
possessed
a
stately
courtesy
and
carriage
which
suggested
a
Spanish
extraction.
A
swarthy
skin,
raven
black
hair,
and
dark,
sparkling
eyes
under
a
pair
of
heavily
tufted
brows
made
a
strange
contrast
to
the
flaxen
or
chestnut
rustics
of
England,
and
the
newcomer
was
soon
known
as
"The
Black
Doctor
of
Bishop's
Crossing."
At
first
it
was
a
term
of
ridicule
and
reproach;
