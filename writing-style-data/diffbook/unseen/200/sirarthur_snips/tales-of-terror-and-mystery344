round
the
museum
when
the
Professor
showed
us
the
admirable
collection
which
he
had
cherished
so
long.
The
Professor's
beautiful
daughter
and
a
young
man,
Captain
Wilson,
who
was,
as
I
understood,
soon
to
be
her
husband,
accompanied
us
in
our
inspection.
There
were
fifteen
rooms,
but
the
Babylonian,
the
Syrian,
and
the
central
hall,
which
contained
the
Jewish
and
Egyptian
collection,
were
the
finest
of
all.
Professor
Andreas
was
a
quiet,
dry,
elderly
man,
with
a
clean
shaven
face
and
an
impassive
manner,
but
his
dark
eyes
sparkled
and
his
features
quickened
into
enthusiastic
life
as
he
pointed
out
to
us
the
rarity
and
the
beauty
of
some
of
his
specimens.
His
hand
lingered
so
fondly
over
them,
that
one
could
read
his
pride
in
them
and
the
grief
in
his
heart
now
that
they
were
passing
from
his
care
into
that
of
another.
He
had
shown
us
in
turn
his
mummies,
his
papyri,
his
rare
scarabs,
his
inscriptions,
his
Jewish
relics,
and
his
duplication
of
the
famous
seven
branched
candlestick
of
the
Temple,
which
was
brought
to
Rome
by
Titus,
and
which
is
supposed
by
some
to
be
lying
at
this
instant
in
the
bed
of
the
Tiber.
