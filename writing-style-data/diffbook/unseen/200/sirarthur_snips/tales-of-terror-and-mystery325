the
counsel.
Considerable
sensation
was
caused
in
the
crowded
court
when
the
first
witness
called
for
the
defence
proved
to
be
Miss
Frances
Morton,
the
sister
of
the
prisoner.
Our
readers
will
remember
that
the
young
lady
had
been
engaged
to
Dr.
Lana,
and
that
it

anger
over
the
sudden
termination

She
alluded
to
her
engagement
to
the
doctor,
touched
briefly
upon
its
termination,
which
was
due,
she
said,
to
personal
matters
connected
with
his
family,
and
surprised
the
court
by
asserting
that
she
had
always
considered
her
brother's
resentment
to
be
unreasonable
and
intemperate.
In
answer
to
a
direct
question

her
counsel,
she
