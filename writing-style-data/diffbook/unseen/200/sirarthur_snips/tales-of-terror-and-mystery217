Now,
I
have
already
said
that
I
was
devoted
to
zoology.
Of
all
branches
of
zoology,
the
study
of
insects
was
the
most
attractive
to
me,
and
of
all
insects
beetles
were
the
species
with
which
I
was
most
familiar.
Butterfly
collectors
are
numerous,
but
beetles
are
far
more
varied,
and
more
accessible
in
these
islands
than
are
butterflies.
It
was
this
fact
which
had
attracted
my
attention
to
them,
and
I
had
myself
made
a
collection
which
numbered
some
hundred
varieties.
As
to
the
other
requisites
of
the
advertisement,
I
knew
that
my
nerves
could
be
depended
upon,
and
I
had
won
the
weight
throwing
competition
at
the
inter
hospital
sports.
Clearly,
I
was
the
very
man
for
the
vacancy.
Within
five
minutes
of
my
having
read
the
advertisement
I
was
in
a
cab
and
on
my
was
to
Brook
Street.
As
I
drove,
I
kept
turning
the
matter
over
in
my
head
and
trying
to
make
a
guess
as
to
what
sort
of
employment
it
could
be
which
needed
such
curious
qualifications.
