a
free
hand
for
a
few
nights,
without
inquiry
as
to
my
comings
and
goings.
To
this
end
I
took
a
room
in
Harding
Street
that
very
night,
with
an
intimation
that
I
was
a
Pressman,
and
that
I
should
keep
very
late
hours.
"That
night
I
made
my
way
into
the
museum,
and
I
replaced
four
of
the
stones.
It
was
hard
work,
and
took

When
Simpson
came
round
I
always
heard
his
footsteps,
and
concealed
myself
in
the
mummy

I
had

been.
He
had
replaced
the
setting
so

work
was
rude
and
clumsy.
However,
I
hoped
that
the
plate
might
not
be
carefully
examined,
or
the
roughness
of
the
setting
observed,
until
my
task
was
done.
Next
night
I
replaced
four
more
stones.
And
tonight
I
should
have
finished
my
task
had
it
not
been
for
the
unfortunate
circumstance
which
has
caused
me
to
reveal
so
much
which
I
should
have
wished
to
keep
concealed.
I
appeal
to
you,
gentlemen,
to
your
sense
of
honour
and
of
compassion,
