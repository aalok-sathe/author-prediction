for
ever
upon
my
brain.
He
had
reared
up
on
his
hind
legs
as
a
bear
would
do,
and
stood
above
me,
enormous,
menacing
such
a
creature
as
no
nightmare
had
ever
brought
to
my
imagination.
I
have
said
that
he
reared
like
a
bear,
and
there
was
something
bear
like
if
one
could
conceive
a
bear
which
was
ten
fold
the
bulk
of
any
bear
seen
upon
earth
in
his
whole
pose
and
attitude,
in
his
great
crooked
forelegs
with
their
ivory
white
claws,
in
his
rugged
skin,
and
in
his
red,
gaping
mouth,
fringed
with
monstrous
fangs.
Only
in
one
point
did
he
differ
from
the
bear,
or
from
any
other
creature
which
walks
the
earth,
and
even
at
that
supreme
moment
a
shudder
of
horror
passed
over
me
as
I
observed
that
the
eyes
which
glistened
in
the
glow
of
my
lantern
were
huge,
projecting
bulbs,
white
and
sightless.
For
a
moment
his
great
paws
swung
over
my
head.
The
next
he
fell
forward
upon
me,
I
and
my
broken
lantern
crashed
to
the
earth,
and
I
remember
no
more.
When
I
came
to
myself
I
was
back
in
the
farm
house
of
the
Allertons.
