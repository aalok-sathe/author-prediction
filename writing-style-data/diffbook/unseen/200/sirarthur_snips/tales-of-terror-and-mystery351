for
writing
an
anonymous
warning
letter
to
his
successor
for
that
the
writing
was
his
was
as
certain
to
me
as
if
I
had
seen
him
actually
doing
it.
He
foresaw
some
danger
to
the
collection.
Was
it
because
he
foresaw
it
that
he
abandoned
his
charge
of
it?
But
if
so,
why
should
he
hesitate
to
warn
Mortimer
in
his
own
name?
I
puzzled
and
puzzled
until
at
last
I
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep,
which
carried
me
beyond
my
usual
hour
of
rising.
I
was
aroused
in
a
singular
and
effective
method,
for
about
nine
o'clock
my
friend
Mortimer
rushed
into
my
room
with
an
expression
of
consternation
upon
his
face.
He
was
usually
one
of
the
most
tidy
men
of
my
acquaintance,
but
now
his
collar
was
undone
at
one
end,
his
tie
was
flying,
and
his
hat
at
the
back
of
his
head.
I
read
his
whole
story
in
his
frantic
eyes.
"The
museum
has
been
robbed!"
I
cried,
springing
up
in
bed.
"I
fear
so!
Those
jewels!
The
jewels
of
the
urim
and
thummim!"
he
gasped,
for
he
was
out
of
breath
with
running.
"I'm
going
on
to
the
police
station.
Come
to
the
museum
