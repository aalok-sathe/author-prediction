Burger.
Some
months
ago
Mr.
Kennedy,
the
well
known
English
student,
disappeared
suddenly
from
his
rooms
in
the
Corso,
and
it
was
conjectured
that
his
association
with
a
recent
scandal
had
driven
him
to
leave
Rome.
It
appears
now
that
he
had
in
reality
fallen
a
victim
to
that
fervid
love
of
archaeology
which
had
raised
him
to
a
distinguished
place
among
living
scholars.
His
body
was
discovered
in
the
heart
of
the
new
catacomb,
and
it
was
evident
from
the
condition
of
his
feet
and
boots
that
he
had
tramped
for
days
through
the
tortuous
corridors
which
make
these
subterranean
tombs
so
dangerous
to
explorers.
The
deceased
gentleman
had,
with
inexplicable
rashness,
made
his
way
into
this
labyrinth
without,
as
far
as
can
be
discovered,
taking
with
him
either
candles
or
matches,
so
that
his
sad
fate
was
the
natural
result
of
his
own
temerity.
What
makes
the
matter
more
painful
is
that
Dr.
Julius
Burger
was
an
intimate
friend
of
the
deceased.
His
joy
at
the
extraordinary
find
which
he
has
been
so
fortunate
as
to
make
has
been
greatly
marred
by
the
terrible
fate
of
his
comrade
and
fellow
worker."
