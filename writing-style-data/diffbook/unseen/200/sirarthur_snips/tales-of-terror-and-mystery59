Kennedy
had
often
been
seduced
by
whim
and
pleasure
from
his
studies,
but
his
mind
was
an
incisive
one,
capable
of
long
and
concentrated
efforts
which
ended
in
sharp
reactions

languor.
His
handsome
face,
with
its
high,
white
forehead,
its
aggressive
nose,

Of
a
very

and
his
companion
had
frequently
remarked
how
much
it
suggested
those
old
Roman
busts
which
peered
out
from
the
shadows
in
the
corners
of
his
chamber.
