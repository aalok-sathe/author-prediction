to
detract
from
its
importance,
for
the
papers
were
disinclined
to
believe
the
facts
as
reported
to
them.
More
than
one
of
the
London
journals
treated
the
matter
as
an
ingenious
hoax,
until
the
coroner's
inquest
upon
the
unfortunate
driver
(an
inquest
which
elicited
nothing
of
importance)
convinced
them
of
the
tragedy
of
the
incident.
Mr.
Bland,
accompanied
by
Inspector
Collins,
the
senior
detective
officer
in
the
service
of
the
company,
went
down
to
Kenyon
Junction
the
same
evening,
and
their
research
lasted
throughout
the
following
day,
but
was
attended
with
purely
negative
results.
Not
only
was
no
trace
found
of
the
missing
train,
but
no
conjecture
could
be
put
forward
which
could
possibly
explain
the
facts.
At
the
same
time,
Inspector
Collins's
official
report
(which
lies
before
me
as
I
write)
served
to
show
that
the
possibilities
were
more
numerous
than
might
have
been
expected.
"In
the
stretch
of
railway
between
these
two
points,"
said
he,
"the
country
is
dotted
with
ironworks
and
collieries.
Of
these,
some
are
being
worked
and
some
have
been
abandoned.
There
are
no
fewer
than
twelve
which
have
small
gauge
lines
which
run
trolly
cars
down
to
the
main
line.
These
can,
of
