direction
you
stand.
Could
you
tell
where
I
am?"
"No;
you
seem
to
be
on
every
side
of
me."
"If
it
were
not
for
this
string
which
I
hold
in
my
hand
I
should
not
have
a
notion
which
way
to
go."
"I
dare
say
not.
Strike
a
light,
man,

halt
for

rest
now
and
then,
I
should
like
you
just
to
think
of
Miss
Mary
Saunderson,
and
whether
you
treated
her
quite
fairly."
"You
devil,
what
do
you
mean?"
roared
Kennedy.
He
was
running
about
in
little
circles
and
clasping
at
the
solid
blackness
with
both
hands.
"Good
bye,"
said
the
mocking
voice,
and
it
was
already
at
some
distance.
"I
really
do
not
