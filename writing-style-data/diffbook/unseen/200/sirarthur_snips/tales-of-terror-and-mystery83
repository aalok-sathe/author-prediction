Kennedy,
even
by
your
own
showing
that
you
did
the
right
thing
by
that
girl.
There
was
only
one
little
thing
which
you
appeared
not
to
know,
and
I
can
supply
it.
Miss
Saunderson
was
engaged
to
a
poor
ungainly
devil
of
a
student,
and
his
name
was
Julius
Burger."
There
was
a
rustle
somewhere,
the
vague
sound
of
a
foot
striking
a
stone,
and
then
there
fell
silence
upon
that
old
Christian
church

stagnant,
heavy
silence
which
closed

Kennedy
and
shut
him
in
like
water
round
a
drowning
man.
Some

"One
of
the
most
interesting
discoveries
of
recent
years
is
that
of
the
new
catacomb
in
Rome,
which
lies
some
distance
to
the
east
of
the
well
known
vaults
of
St.
Calixtus.
The
finding
of
this
important
burial
place,
which
is
exceeding
rich
in
most
interesting
early
Christian
remains,
is
due
to
the
energy
and
sagacity
of
Dr.
Julius
Burger,
the
young
German
specialist,
who
is
rapidly
taking
the
first
place
as
an
authority
upon
ancient
Rome.
Although
the
first
to
publish
his
discovery,
it
appears
that
a
less
fortunate
adventurer
had
anticipated
