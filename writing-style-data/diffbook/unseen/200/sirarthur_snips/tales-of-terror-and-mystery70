my
own
experience
that
I
cannot
even
imagine
how
you
set
about
it.
For
example,
if
you
had
loved
this
girl
your
love
could
hardly
disappear
in
three
weeks,
so
I
presume
that
you
could
not
have
loved
her
at
all.
But
if
you
did
not
love
her
why
should
you
make
this
great
scandal
which
has
damaged
you
and
ruined
her?"
Kennedy
looked
moodily
into
the
red
eye
of
the
stove.
"That's
a
logical
way
of
looking
at
it,
certainly,"
said
he.
"Love
is
a
big
word,
and
it
represents
a

how

Kennedy,
why
did
you
do
it?"
"The
adventure
of
the
thing
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it."
"What!
You
are
so
fond
of
adventures!"
"Where
would
the
variety
of
life
be
without
them?
It
was
for
an
adventure
that
I
first
began
to
pay
my
attentions
to
her.
I've
chased
a
good
deal
of

in
my
time,
but
