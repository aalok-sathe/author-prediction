sympathetic
listener,
and
he
talked
and
talked
until
the
spring
evening
had
deepened
into
night,
and
the
gong
announced
that
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner.
All
the
time
Lord
Linchmere
said
nothing,
but
he
stood
at
his
brother
in
law's
elbow,
and
I
caught
him
continually
shooting
curious
little,
questioning
glances
into
his
face.
And
his
own
features
expressed
some
strong
emotion,
apprehension,
sympathy,
expectation:
I
seemed
to
read
them
all.
I
was
sure
that
Lord
Linchmere
was
fearing
something
and
awaiting
something,
but
what
that
something
might
be
I
could
not
imagine.
The
evening
passed
quietly
but
pleasantly,
and
I
should
have
been
entirely
at
my
ease
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
continual
sense
of
tension
upon
the
part
of
Lord
Linchmere.
As
to
our
host,
I
found
that
he
improved
upon
acquaintance.
He
spoke
constantly
with
affection
of
his
absent
wife,
and
also
of
his
little
son,
who
had
recently
been
sent
to
school.
The
house,
he
said,
was
not
the
same
without
them.
If
it
were
not
for
his
scientific
studies,
he
did
not
know
how
he
could
get
through
the
days.
After
dinner
we
smoked
for
some
time
in
the
billiard
room,
