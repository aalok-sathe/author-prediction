the

Perseverance.
Is
there
a
secret
society
of
colliers,
an
English
Camorra,
which
is
capable
of
destroying
both
train
and
passengers?
It
is
improbable,
but
it
is
not
impossible.
I
confess
that
I
am
unable
to
suggest
any
other
solution.
I
should
certainly
advise
the
company
to
direct
all
their
energies
towards
the
observation
of
those
three
lines,
and
of
the
workmen
at
the
end
of
them.
A
careful
supervision
of
the
pawnbrokers'
shops
of
the
district
might
possibly
bring
some
suggestive
facts
to
light."
The
suggestion
coming
from
a
recognized
authority
upon
such
matters
created
considerable
interest,
and
a
fierce
opposition
from
those
who
considered
such
a
statement
to
be
a
preposterous
libel
upon
an
honest
and
deserving
set
of
men.
The
only
answer
to
this
criticism
was
a
challenge
to
the
objectors
to
lay
any
more
feasible
explanations
before
the
public.
In
reply
to
this
two
others
were
forthcoming
(Times,
July
7th
and
9th).
The
first
suggested
that
the
train
might
have
run
off
the
metals
and
be
lying
submerged
in
the
Lancashire
and
Staffordshire
Canal,
which
runs
parallel
to
the
railway
for
some
hundred
of
yards.
This
suggestion
was
thrown
out
of
court
