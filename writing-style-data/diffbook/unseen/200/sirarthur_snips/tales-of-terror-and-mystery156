it
is
unpleasant
to
feel
that
there
is
one
person
in
the
house
who
eagerly
desires
your
departure.
Mrs.
King's
sallow
face
and
forbidding
eyes
had
become
more
and
more
hateful
to
me.
She
was
no
longer
actively
rude
her
fear
of
her
husband
prevented
her
but
she
pushed
her
insane
jealousy
to
the
extent
of
ignoring
me,
never
addressing
me,
and
in
every
way
making
my
stay
at
Greylands
as
uncomfortable
as
she
could.
So
offensive
was
her
manner
during
that
last
day,
that
I
should
certainly
have
left
had
it
not
been
for
that
interview
with
my
host
in
the
evening
which
would,
I
hoped,
retrieve
my
broken
fortunes.
It
was
very
late
when
it
occurred,
for
my
relative,
who
had
been
receiving
even
more
telegrams
than
usual
during
the
day,
went
off
to
his
study
after
dinner,
and
only
emerged
when
the
household
had
retired
to
bed.
I
heard
him
go
round
locking
the
doors,
as
custom
was
of
a
night,
and
finally
he
joined
me
in
the
billiard
room.
His
stout
figure
was
wrapped
in
a
dressing
gown,
and
he
wore
a
pair
of
red
Turkish
slippers
without
any
heels.
Settling
down
into
an
arm
chair,
