not
feel
that
she
had
any
grievance
whatever
against
Dr.
Lana,
and
that
in
her
opinion
he
had
acted
in
a
perfectly
honourable
manner.
Her
brother,
on
an
insufficient
knowledge
of
the
facts,
had
taken
another
view,
and
she
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
that,
in
spite
of
her
entreaties,
he
had
uttered
threats
of
personal
violence
against
the
doctor,
and
had,
upon
the
evening
of
the
tragedy,
announced
his
intention
of
"having
it
out
with
him."
She
had
done
her
best
to
bring
him
to
a
more
reasonable
frame
of
mind,
but
he
was
very
headstrong
where
his
emotions
or
prejudices
were
concerned.
Up
to
this
point
the
young
lady's
evidence
had
appeared
to
make
against
the
prisoner
rather
than
in
his
favour.
The
questions
of
her
counsel,
however,
soon
put
a
very
different
light
upon
the
matter,
and
disclosed
an
unexpected
line
of
defence.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Do
you
believe
your
brother
to
be
guilty
of
this
crime?
The
Judge:
I
cannot
permit
that
question,
Mr.
Humphrey.
We
are
here
to
decide
upon
questions
of
fact
not
of
belief.
Mr.
Humphrey:
Do
you
know
that
your
brother
is
not
guilty
of
the
death
of
Doctor
Lana?
Miss
Morton:
Yes.
Mr.
