'calls
himself'
because
I
have
reason
now
to
believe
that
it
is
not
his
correct
name.
It
would
take
me
too
long
if
I
were
to
describe
all
the
means
by
which
he
obtained
an
introduction
to
me
and
ingratiated
himself
into
my
friendship
and
the
affection
of
my
daughter.
He
brought
letters
from
foreign
colleagues
which
compelled
me
to
show
him
some
attention.
And
then,
by
his
own
attainments,
which
are
considerable,
he
succeeded
in
making
himself
a
very
welcome
visitor
at
my
rooms.
When
I
learned
that
my
daughter's
affections
had
been
gained
by
him,
I
may
have
thought
it
premature,
but
I
certainly
was
not
surprised,
for
he
had
a
charm
of
manner
and
of
conversation
which
would
have
made
him
conspicuous
in
any
society.
"He
was
much
interested
in
Oriental
antiquities,
and
his
knowledge
of
the
subject
justified
his
interest.
Often
when
he
spent
the
evening
with
us
he
would
ask
permission
to
go
down
into
the
museum
and
have
an
opportunity
of
privately
inspecting
the
various
specimens.
You
can
imagine
that
I,
as
an
enthusiast,
was
in
sympathy
with
such
a
request,
and
that
I
felt
no
surprise
at
the
constancy
of
his
visits.
