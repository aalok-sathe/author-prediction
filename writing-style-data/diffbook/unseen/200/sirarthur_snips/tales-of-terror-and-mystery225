the
sum,
and
must
have
showed
my
surprise
upon
my
features.
"It
is
a
rare
combination
of
qualities,
as
must
have
struck
you
when
you
first
read
the
advertisement,"
said
Lord
Linchmere;
"such
varied
gifts
may
well
command
a
high
return,
and
I
do
not
conceal
from
you
that
your
duties
might
be
arduous
or
even
dangerous.
Besides,
it
is
possible
that
one
or
two
days
may
bring
the
matter
to
an
end."
"Please
God!"
sighed
his
sister.
"So
now,
Dr.
Hamilton,
may
I
rely
upon
your
aid?"
"Most
undoubtedly,"
said
I.
"You
have
only
to
tell
me
what
my
duties
are."
"Your
first
duty
will
be
to
return
to
your
home.
You
will
pack
up
whatever
you
may
need
for
a
short
visit
to
the
country.
We
start
together
from
Paddington
Station
at
3:40
this
afternoon."
"Do
we
go
far?"
"As
far
as
Pangbourne.
Meet
me
at
the
bookstall
at
3:30.
I
shall
have
the
tickets.
Goodbye,
Dr.
Hamilton!
And,
by
the
way,
there
are
two
things
which
I
should
be
very
glad
if
you
would
bring
with
you,
in
case
you
have
them.
One
is
your
case
for
collecting
beetles,
and
the
other
is
a
stick,
and
the
