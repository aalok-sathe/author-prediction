a
souvenir
of
the
occasion.
I
have
no
wish
to
publish
these
papers;
but,
still,
it
is
every
man
for
himself
in
this
world,
and
what
else
can
I
do
if
my
friends
will
not
come
to
my
aid
when
I
want
them?
Messieurs,
you
may
believe
that
Herbert
de
Lernac
is
quite
as
formidable
when
he
is
against
you
as
when
he
is
with
you,
and
that
he
is
not
a
man
to
go
to
the
guillotine
until
he
has
seen
that
every
one
of
you
is

for
New
Caledonia.
For
your
own
sake,
if
not

and
General
,
and
Baron

up
the
blanks
for
yourselves
as
you
read

I
promise
you
that
in
the
next
edition
there
will
be
no
blanks
to
fill.
"P.S.
As
I
look
over
my
statement
there
is
only
one
omission
which
I
can
see.
It
concerns
the
unfortunate
man
McPherson,
who
was
foolish
enough
to
write
to
his
wife
and
to
make
an
appointment
with
her
in
New
York.
It
can
be
imagined
that
when
interests
like
ours
were
at
stake,
we
could
not
leave
them
to
the
chance
of
