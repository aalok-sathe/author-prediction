all
sizes,
but
none
so
large
as
the
first.
Some
were
quite
small,
but
the
majority
about
as
big
as
an
average
balloon,
and
with
much
the
same
curvature
at
the
top.
There
was
in
them
a
delicacy
of
texture
and
colouring
which
reminded
me
of
the
finest
Venetian
glass.
Pale
shades
of
pink
and
green
were
the
prevailing
tints,
but
all
had
a
lovely
iridescence
where
the
sun
shimmered
through

forms.
Some
hundreds
of
them

These
were

of
vapour
like
material,
which
turned
and
twisted
with
great
speed,
flying
round
and
round
at
such
a
pace
that
the
eyes
could
hardly
follow
them.
Some
of
these
ghost
like
creatures
were
twenty
or
thirty
feet
long,
but
it
was
difficult
to
tell
their
girth,
for
their
outline
was
