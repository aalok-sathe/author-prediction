and
benevolent,
short
and
stout,
forty
five
years
old,
perhaps,
with
a
round,
good
humoured
face,
burned
brown
with
the
tropical
sun,
and
shot
with
a
thousand
wrinkles.
He
wore
white
linen
clothes,
in
true
planter
style,
with
a
cigar
between
his
lips,
and
a
large
Panama
hat
upon
the
back
of
his
head.
It
was
such
a
figure
as
one
associates
with
a
verandahed
bungalow,
and
it
looked
curiously
out
of
place
in
front
of
this
broad,
stone
English
mansion,
with
its
solid
wings
and
its
Palladio
pillars
before
the
doorway.
"My

he
cried,
glancing
over
his
shoulder;
"my
dear,
here
is
our
guest!
Welcome,
welcome
to
Greylands!
I
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance,
Cousin
Marshall,
and
I
take
it
as
a
great
compliment
that
you
should
honour
this
sleepy
little
country
place
with
your
presence."
Nothing
could
be
more
hearty
than
his
manner,
and
he
set
me
at
my
ease
in
an
instant.
But
it
needed
all
his
cordiality
to
atone
for
the
frigidity
and
even
rudeness
of
his
wife,
a
tall,
haggard
woman,
who
came
forward
at
his
summons.
She
was,
I
believe,
of
Brazilian
extraction,
though
she
spoke
excellent
English,
and
I
excused
her
