had
passed
since
my
terrible
adventure
in
the
Blue
John
Gap.
It
seems
that
I
had
lain
all
night
in
the
cave
insensible
from
concussion
of
the
brain,
with
my
left
arm
and
two
ribs
badly
fractured.
In
the
morning
my
note
had
been
found,
a
search
party
of
a
dozen
farmers
assembled,
and
I
had
been
tracked
down
and
carried
back
to
my
bedroom,
where
I
had
lain
in
high
delirium
ever
since.
There
was,
it
seems,
no
sign
of
the
creature,
and
no
bloodstain
which
would
show
that
my
bullet
had
found
him
as
he
passed.
Save
for
my
own
plight
and
the
marks
upon
the
mud,
there
was
nothing
to
prove
that
what
I
said
was
true.
Six
weeks
have
now
elapsed,
and
I
am
able
to
sit
out
once
more
in
the
sunshine.
Just
opposite
me
is
the
steep
hillside,
grey
with
shaly
rock,
and
yonder
on
its
flank
is
the
dark
cleft
which
marks
the
opening
of
the
Blue
John
Gap.
But
it
is
no
longer
a
source
of
terror.
Never
again
through
that
ill
omened
tunnel
shall
any
strange
shape
flit
out
into
the
world
of
men.
The
educated
and
the
scientific,
