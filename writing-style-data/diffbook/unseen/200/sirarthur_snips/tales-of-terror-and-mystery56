the

"Yes,
I
am
sure

right.
I
can

out

plainly."
"What
I
have
read
to
you
tonight,"
said
Dacre,
"is
the
official
record
of
the
trial
of
Marie
Madeleine
d'Aubray,
Marquise
de
Brinvilliers,
one
of

and
murderers
of
all

I
sat
in
silence,
overwhelmed

the
extraordinary

the
incident,

torture
of
her

to
atone
for
the
horror
of
her
life,
and
that
all
Paris
had
sympathized
with
her
last
moments,
and
blessed
her
as
a
martyr
within
a
few
days
of
the
time
when
they
had
cursed
her
as
a
murderess.
One
objection,
and
one

occurred
to
my
mind.
