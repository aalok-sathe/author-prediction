since
the
house
which
he
occupied
was
a
large
one,
and
it
was
known
that
his
success
in
practice
had
enabled
him
to
save
considerable
sums.
At
first
the
local
matchmakers
were
continually
coupling
his
name
with
one
or
other
of
the
eligible
ladies,
but
as
years
passed
and
Dr.
Lana
remained
unmarried,
it
came
to
be
generally
understood
that
for

side,

father,
James

Morton,
having
been
the
Squire
of
Bishop's
Crossing.
Both
her
parents
were,
however,
dead,
and
she
lived
with
her
only
brother,
Arthur
Morton,
who
had
inherited
the
family
estate.
In
person
Miss
Morton
was
tall
and
stately,
and
she
was
famous
for
her
quick,
impetuous
nature
