able
to
fulfil
my
compact
I
was
living
in
a
cottage
at
Fontainebleau,
and
as
the
evening
trains
were
inconvenient,
he
asked
me
to
spend
the
night
in
his
house.
"I
have
only
that
one
spare
couch,"
said
he,
pointing
to
a
broad
sofa
in
his
large
salon;
"I
hope
that
you
will
manage
to
be
comfortable
there."
It
was
a
singular
bedroom,
with
its
high
walls
of
brown
volumes,
but
there
could
be
no
more
agreeable
furniture
to
a
bookworm
like
myself,
and
there
is
no
scent
so
pleasant
to
my
nostrils
as
that
faint,
subtle
reek
which
comes
from
an
ancient
book.
I
assured
him
that
I
could
desire
no
more
charming
chamber,
and
no
more
congenial
surroundings.
"If
the
fittings
are
neither
convenient
nor
conventional,
they
are
at
least
costly,"
said
he,
looking
round
at
his
shelves.
"I
have
expended
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
money
upon
these
objects
which
surround
you.
Books,
weapons,
gems,
carvings,
tapestries,
images
there
is
hardly
a
thing
here
which
has
not
its
history,
and
it
is
generally
one
worth
telling."
He
was
seated
as
he
spoke
at
one
side
of
the
open
fire
place,
and
I
at
the
other.
