promptly,
fearlessly,
if
I
were
to
have
a
chance
for
life.
In
an
instant
I
had
formed
my
plan.
Pulling
off
my
dress
coat,
I
threw
it
down
over
the
head
of
the
beast.
At
the
same
moment
I
dropped
over
the
edge,
seized
the
end
of
the
front
grating,
and
pulled
it
frantically
out
of
the
wall.
It
came
more
easily
than
I
could
have
expected.
I
rushed
across
the
room,
bearing
it
with
me;
but,
as
I
rushed,
the
accident
of
my
position
put
me
upon
the
outer
side.
Had
it
been
the
other
way,
I
might
have
come
off
scathless.
As
it
was,
there
was
a
moment's
pause
as
I
stopped
it
and
tried
to
pass
in
through
the
opening
which
I
had
left.
That
moment
was
enough
to
give
time
to
the
creature
to
toss
off
the
coat
with
which
I
had
blinded
him
and
to
spring
upon
me.
I
hurled
myself
through
the
gap
and
pulled
the
rails
to
behind
me,
but
he
seized
my
leg
before
I
could
entirely
withdraw
it.
One
stroke
of
that
huge
paw
tore
off
my
calf
as
a
shaving
of
wood
curls
off
before
a
plane.
The
next
moment,
