with
stout
wire
netting
between,
and
it
rested
upon
a
strong
stanchion
at
each
end.
It
stood
now
as
a
great
barred
canopy
over
the
crouching
figure
in
the
corner.
The
space
between
this
iron
shelf
and
the
roof
may
have
been
from
two
or
three
feet.
If
I
could
only
get
up
there,
squeezed
in
between
bars
and
ceiling,
I
should
have
only
one
vulnerable
side.
I
should
be
safe
from
below,
from
behind,
and
from
each
side.
Only
on
the
open
face
of
it
could
I
be
attacked.
There,
it
is
true,
I
had
no
protection
whatever;
but
at
least,
I
should
be
out
of
the
brute's
path
when
he
began
to
pace
about
his
den.
He
would
have
to
come
out
of
his
way
to
reach
me.
It
was
now
or
never,
for
if
once
the
light
were
out
it
would
be
impossible.
With
a
gulp
in
my
throat
I
sprang
up,
seized
the
iron
edge
of
the
top,
and
swung
myself
panting
on
to
it.
I
writhed
in
face
downwards,
and
found
myself
looking
straight
into
the
terrible
eyes
and
yawning
jaws
of
the
cat.
Its
fetid
breath
came
up
into
my
face
like
the
steam
