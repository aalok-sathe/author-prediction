this
night's
work.
"The
case
may
be
made
clear
in
a
very
few
words,"
he
continued,
when
we
were
alone.
"My
poor
brother
in
law
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
upon
earth,
a
loving
husband
and
an
estimable
father,
but
he
comes
from
a
stock
which
is
deeply
tainted
with
insanity.
He
has
more
than

because

injure
those
whom
he
loves
so
dearly.
It
is
often,
as
you
know,
a
characteristic
of
such
maladies
that
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
convince
the
man
who
suffers
from
them
of
their
existence.
"Our
great
object
was,
of

to
get
him
