that
this
box
was
fastened
to
his
wrist
by
a
strap.
No
importance
was
attached
to
the
fact
at
the
time,
but
subsequent
events
endowed
it
with
some
significance.
Monsieur
Caratal
was
shown
up
to
Mr.
Bland's
office,
while
his
companion
remained
outside.
Monsieur
Caratal's
business
was
quickly
dispatched.
He
had
arrived
that
afternoon
from
Central
America.
Affairs
of
the
utmost
importance
demanded
that
he
should
be
in
Paris
without
the
loss
of
an
unnecessary

He
had
missed
the
London

A
special

Money
was
of
no
importance.

was

Bland
struck

traffic
manager,
and
had
the

arranged
in
five

in
three
quarters
of
an
hour.
It
would
take
that
time
to
insure
that
the
line
should
be
clear.
The
powerful
engine
called
Rochdale
(No.
247
on
the
company's
register)
was
attached
to
two
carriages,
with
a
guard's
van
behind.
The
first
carriage
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
decreasing
the
inconvenience
arising
from
the
oscillation.
The
second
was
divided,
as
usual,
into
four
compartments,
