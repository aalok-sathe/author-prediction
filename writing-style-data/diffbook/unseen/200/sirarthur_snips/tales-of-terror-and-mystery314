she
observed
that
his
manner
was
excited,
and
that
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
heavy
hunting
crop.
He
was
turning
in
at
the
gate
when
she
addressed
him.
"The
doctor
is
not
in,
sir,"
said
she.
"How
do
you
know
that?"
he
asked
harshly.
"I
have
been
to
the
surgery
door,
sir."
"I
see
a
light,"
said
the
young
squire,
looking
up
the
drive.
"That
is
in
his
study,
is
it
not?"
"Yes,
sir;
but
I
am
sure
that
he
is
out."
"Well,
he
must
come
in
again,"
said
young
Morton,
and
passed
through
the
gate
while
Mrs.
Madding
went
upon
her
homeward
way.
At
three
o'clock
that
morning
her
husband
suffered
a
sharp
relapse,
and
she
was
so
alarmed
by
his
symptoms
that
she
determined
to
call
the
doctor
without
delay.
As
she
passed
through
the
gate
she
was
surprised
to
see
someone
lurking
among
the
laurel
bushes.
It
was
certainly
a
man,
and
to
the
best
of
her
belief
Mr.
Arthur
Morton.
Preoccupied
with
her
own
troubles,
she
gave
no
particular
attention
to
the
incident,
but
hurried
on
upon
her
errand.
When
she
reached
the
house
she
perceived
to
her
surprise
that
the
light
was
still
burning
