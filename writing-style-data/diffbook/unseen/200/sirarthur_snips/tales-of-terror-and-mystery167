so
great
a
bulk
passing
like
a
shadow,
with
hardly
the
softest
thudding
of
velvety
pads.
The
candle
was
burning
low
so
low
that
I
could
hardly
see
the
creature.
And
then,
with
a
last
flare
and
splutter
it
went
out
altogether.
I
was
alone
with
the
cat
in
the
dark!
It
helps
one
to
face
a
danger
when
one
knows
that
one
has
done
all
that
possibly
can
be
done.
There
is
nothing
for
it
then
but
to
quietly
await
the
result.
In
this
case,
there
was
no
chance
of
safety
anywhere
except
the
precise
spot
where
I
was.
I
stretched
myself
out,
therefore,
and
lay
silently,
almost
breathlessly,
hoping
that
the
beast
might
forget
my
presence
if
I
did
nothing
to
remind
him.
I
reckoned
that
it
must
already
be
two
o'clock.
At
four
it
would
be
full
dawn.
I
had
not
more
than
two
hours
to
wait
for
daylight.
Outside,
the
storm
was
still
raging,
and
the
rain
lashed
continually
against
the
little
windows.
Inside,
the
poisonous
and
fetid
air
was
overpowering.
I
could
neither
hear
nor
see
the
cat.
I
tried
to
think
about
other
things
but
only
one
had
power
enough
to
draw
my
mind
