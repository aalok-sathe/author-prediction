time.
In
his
pockets
were
found
no
fewer
than
six
valuable
gold
watches,
three
in
the
various
pockets
of
his
waist
coat,
one
in
his
ticket
pocket,
one
in
his
breast
pocket,
and
one
small
one
set
in
a
leather
strap
and
fastened
round
his
left
wrist.
The
obvious
explanation
that
the
man
was
a
pickpocket,
and
that
this
was
his
plunder,
was
discounted
by
the
fact
that
all
six
were
of
American
make
and
of
a
type
which
is
rare
in
England.
Three
of
them
bore
the
mark
of
the
Rochester
Watchmaking
Company;
one
was
by
Mason,
of
Elmira;
one
was
unmarked;
and
the
small
one,
which
was
highly
jewelled
and
ornamented,
was
from
Tiffany,
of
New
York.
The
other
contents
of
his
pocket
consisted
of
an
ivory
knife
with
a
corkscrew
by
Rodgers,
of
Sheffield;
a
small,
circular
mirror,
one
inch
in
diameter;
a
readmission
slip
to
the
Lyceum
Theatre;
a
silver
box
full
of
vesta
matches,
and
a
brown
leather
cigar
case
containing
two
cheroots
also
two
pounds
fourteen
shillings
in
money.
It
was
clear,
then,
that
whatever
motives
may
have
led
to
his
death,
robbery
was
not
among
them.
As
already
mentioned,
there
were
no
markings
