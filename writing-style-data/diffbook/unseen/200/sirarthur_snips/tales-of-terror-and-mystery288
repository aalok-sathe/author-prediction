so
regular
and
consistent,
that
an
almost
superstitious
feeling
has
arisen
about
it
in
the
household.
I
assure
you
that
if
I
were
to
repeat
to
you
the
tales
which
are
flying
about,
tales
of
mysterious
visitors
there,
and
of
voices
overheard
by
the
servants,
you
might
suspect
that
Sir
John
had
relapsed
into
his
old
ways."
"Why
do
you
say
relapsed?"
I
asked.
He
looked
at
me
in
surprise.
"Is
it
possible,"
said
he,
"that
Sir
John
Bollamore's
previous
history
is
unknown
to
you?"
"Absolutely."
"You
astound
me.
I
thought
that
every
man
in
England
knew
something
of
his
antecedents.
I
should
not
mention
the
matter
if
it
were
not
that
you
are
now
one
of
ourselves,
and
that
the
facts
might
come
to
your
ears
in
some
harsher
form
if
I
were
silent
upon
them.
I
always
took
it
for
granted
that
you
knew
that
you
were
in
the
service
of
'Devil'
Bollamore."
"But
why
'Devil'?"
I
asked.
"Ah,
you
are
young
and
the
world
moves
fast,
but
twenty
years
ago
the
name
of
'Devil'
Bollamore
was
one
of
the
best
known
in
London.
He
was
the
leader
of
the
fastest
set,
bruiser,
driver,
gambler,
drunkard
