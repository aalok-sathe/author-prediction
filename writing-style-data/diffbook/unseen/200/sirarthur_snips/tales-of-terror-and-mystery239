Instantly
he
was
sitting
up,
with
an
expression
of
the
keenest
interest
upon
his
face.
"You
have
heard
something?"
"No,
sir.
It
is
two
o'clock."
"Very
good.
I
will
watch.
You
can
go
to
sleep."
I
lay
down
under
the
coverlet
as
he
had
done
and
was
soon
unconscious.
My
last
recollection
was
of
that
circle
of
lamplight,
and
of
the
small,
hunched
up
figure
and
strained,
anxious
face
of
Lord
Linchmere
in
the
centre
of
it.
How
long
I
slept
I
do
not
know;
but
I
was
suddenly
aroused
by
a
sharp
tug
at
my
sleeve.
The
room
was
in
darkness,
but
a
hot
smell
of
oil
told
me
that
the
lamp
had
only
that
instant
been
extinguished.
"Quick!
Quick!"
said
Lord
Linchmere's
voice
in
my
ear.
I
sprang
out
of
bed,
he
still
dragging
at
my
arm.
"Over
here!"
he
whispered,
and
pulled
me
into
a
corner
of
the
room.
"Hush!
Listen!"
In
the
silence
of
the
night
I
could
distinctly
hear
that
someone
was
coming
down
the
corridor.
It
was
a
stealthy
step,
faint
and
intermittent,
as
of
a
man
who
paused
cautiously
after
every
stride.
Sometimes
for
half
a
minute
there
was
no
sound,
and
then
