to
be
seen
nothing
but
the
distant,
silver
cloud
plain.
However,
I
got
my
direction
as
best
I
might
and
kept
her
head
straight
to
the
mark.
I
reckoned
that
my
petrol
supply
would
not
last
for
more
than
another
hour
or
so,
but
I
could
afford
to
use
it
to
the
last
drop,
since
a
single
magnificent
vol
plane
could
at

to
the
earth.
"Suddenly
I
was
aware
of
something
new.
The
air
in
front
of
me
had
lost
its

clearness.
It

about
in
wreaths
and

in
the
sunlight.
As
the
monoplane
shot

it,
I
was
aware
of
a
faint
taste
of
oil
upon
my
lips,
and
there
was
a
greasy
scum
upon
the
woodwork
of
the
machine.
Some
infinitely
fine
organic
matter
appeared
to
be
suspended
in
the
atmosphere.
There
was
no
life
there.
It
was
inchoate
and
diffuse,
extending
for
many
square
acres
and
then
fringing
off
into
the
void.
No,
it
was
not
life.
But
might
it
not
be
the
remains
of
life?
Above
