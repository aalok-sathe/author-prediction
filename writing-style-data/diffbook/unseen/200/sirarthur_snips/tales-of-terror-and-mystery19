land
beneath
me
fell
away
to
such
a
distance
that
the
folds
and
hummocks
of
silver
had
all
smoothed
out
into
one
flat,
shining
plain.
But
suddenly
I
had
a
horrible
and
unprecedented
experience.
I
have
known
before
what
it
is
to
be
in
what
our
neighbours
have
called
a
tourbillon,
but
never
on
such
a
scale
as
this.
That
huge,
sweeping
river
of
wind
of
which
I
have
spoken
had,
as
it
appears,
whirlpools
within
it
which
were
as
monstrous
as
itself.
Without
a
moment's
warning
I
was
dragged
suddenly
into
the
heart
of
one.
I
spun
round
for
a
minute
or
two
with
such
velocity
that
I
almost
lost
my
senses,
and
then
fell
suddenly,
left
wing
foremost,
down
the
vacuum
funnel
in
the
centre.
I
dropped
like
a
stone,
and
lost
nearly
a
thousand
feet.
It
was
only
my
belt
that
kept
me
in
my
seat,
and
the
shock
and
breathlessness
left
me
hanging
half
insensible
over
the
side
of
the
fuselage.
But
I
am
always
capable
of
a
supreme
effort
it
is
my
one
great
merit
as
an
aviator.
I
was
conscious
that
the
descent
was
slower.
The
whirlpool
was
a
cone
rather
than
a
funnel,
