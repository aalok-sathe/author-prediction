tramp,
or
may
have
come
into
the
possession
of
the
police,
who
kept
the
incident
to
themselves.
Anyhow,
I
have
seen
nothing
about
it
in
the
London
papers.
As
to
the
watches,
they
were
a
selection
from
those
which
had
been
intrusted
to
him
for
business
purposes.
It
may
have
been
for
the
same
business
purposes
that
he
was
taking
them
to
Manchester,
but
well,
it's
too
late
to
enter
into
that.
"I
don't
blame
the
police
for
being
at
fault.
I
don't
see
how
it
could
have
been
otherwise.
There
was
just
one
little
clue
that
they
might
have
followed
up,
but
it
was
a
small
one.
I
mean
that
small,
circular
mirror
which
was
found
in
my
brother's
pocket.
It
isn't
a
very
common
thing
for
a
young
man
to
carry
about
with
him,
is
it?
But
a
gambler
might
have
told
you
what
such
a
mirror
may
mean
to
a
card
sharper.
If
you
sit
back
a
little
from
the
table,
and
lay
the
mirror,
face
upwards,
upon
your
lap,
you
can
see,
as
you
deal,
every
card
that
you
give
to
your
adversary.
It
is
not
hard
to
say
whether
you
see
a
man
or
raise
