his
actual
engagement
to
Elise,
there
was
hardly
an
evening
which
he
did
not
pass
with
us,
and
an
hour
or
two
were
generally
devoted
to
the
museum.
He
had
the
free
run
of
the
place,
and
when
I
have
been
away
for
the
evening
I
had
no
objection
to
his
doing
whatever
he
wished
here.
This
state
of
things
was
only
terminated
by
the
fact
of
my
resignation
of
my
official
duties
and
my
retirement
to
Norwood,
where
I
hoped
to
have
the
leisure
to
write
a

came
to
me
through
letters
from
my
friends
abroad,
which
showed
me
that
his
introductions
to
me
had
been
forgeries.
Aghast
at
the
revelation,
I
asked
myself
what
motive
this
man
could
originally
have
had
in
practising
this
elaborate
deception
upon
me.
I
was
too
poor
a
man
for
any
fortune
hunter
to
have
marked
me
down.
Why,
then,
had
he
come?
I
