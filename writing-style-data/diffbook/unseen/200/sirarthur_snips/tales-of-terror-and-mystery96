hour
has
passed."
As
they
stepped
out
into
the
darkness,
a
sheet
of
rain
was
driven
in
upon
their
faces,
and
the
hall
lamp,
which
dangled
from
the
arm
of
a
marble
Caryatid,
went
out
with
a
fluff.
Pim,
the
butler,
pushed
the
heavy
door
to,
straining
hard
with
his
shoulder
against
the
wind,
while
the
two
men
groped
their
way
towards
the
yellow
glare
which
showed
where
the
cab
was
waiting.
An
instant
later
they
were
rattling
upon
their
journey.
"Is
it
far?"
asked
Douglas
Stone.
"Oh,
no.
We
have
a
very
little
quiet
place
off
the
Euston
Road."
The
surgeon
pressed
the
spring
of
his
repeater
and
listened
to
the
little
tings
which
told
him
the
hour.
It
was
a
quarter
past
nine.
He
calculated
the
distances,
and
the
short
time
which
it
would
take
him
to
perform
so
trivial
an
operation.
He
ought
to
reach
Lady
Sannox
by
ten
o'clock.
Through
the
fogged
windows
he
saw
the
blurred
gas
lamps
dancing
past,
with
occasionally
the
broader
glare
of
a
shop
front.
The
rain
was
pelting
and
rattling
upon
the
leathern
top
of
the
carriage,
and
the
wheels
swashed
as
they
rolled
through
puddle
and
mud.
