larger
than
the
largest
elephant,
and
its
breadth
seemed
to
be
nearly
as
great
as
its
height.
It
fills
me
with
amazement
now
to
think
that
I
should
have
dared
to
follow
such
a
horror
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth,
but
when
one's
blood
is
up,
and
when
one's
quarry
seems
to
be
flying,
the
old
primeval
hunting
spirit
awakes
and
prudence
is
cast
to
the
wind.
Rifle
in
hand,
I
ran
at
the
top
of
my
speed
upon
the
trail
of
the
monster.
I
had
seen
that
the
creature
was
swift.
Now
I
was
to
find
out
to
my
cost
that
it
was
also
very
cunning.
I
had
imagined
that
it
was
in
panic
flight,
and
that
I
had
only
to
pursue
it.
The
idea
that
it
might
turn
upon
me
never
entered
my
excited
brain.
I
have
already
explained
that
the
passage
down
which
I
was
racing
opened
into
a
great
central
cave.
Into
this
I
rushed,
fearful
lest
I
should
lose
all
trace
of
the
beast.
But
he
had
turned
upon
his
own
traces,
and
in
a
moment
we
were
face
to
face.
That
picture,
seen
in
the
brilliant
white
light
of
the
lantern,
is
etched
