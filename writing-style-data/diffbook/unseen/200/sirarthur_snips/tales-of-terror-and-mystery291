And
now
the
silent
and
majestic
figure
of
my
employer
became
an
object
of
greater
interest
to
me.
I
began
to
understand
that
strangely
human
look
in
his
eyes,
those
deep
lines
upon
his
care
worn
face.
He
was
a
man
who
was
fighting
a
ceaseless
battle,
holding
at
arm's
length,
from
morning
till

a
horrible
adversary

slinks
beside
its

ready
at
any
unguarded
moment
to
spring
at
his
throat.
And
the
dead
woman,
the
woman
who
had
spent
her
life
in
warding
off
this
danger,
took
shape
also
to
my
imagination,
and
I
saw
her
as
a
shadowy
but
beautiful
presence
which
intervened
