my
father,
a
good,
sanguine,
easy
going
man,
had
such
confidence
in
the
wealth
and
benevolence
of
his
bachelor
elder
brother,
Lord
Southerton,
that
he
took
it
for
granted
that
I,
his
only
son,
would
never
be
called
upon
to
earn
a
living
for
myself.
He
imagined
that
if
there
were
not
a
vacancy
for
me
on
the
great
Southerton
Estates,
at
least
there
would
be
found
some
post
in
that
diplomatic
service
which
still
remains
the
special
preserve
of
our
privileged
classes.
He
died
too
early
to
realize
how
false
his
calculations
had
been.
Neither
my
uncle
nor
the
State
took
the
slightest
notice
of
me,
or
showed
any
interest
in
my
career.
An
occasional
brace
of
pheasants,
or
basket
of
hares,
was
all
that
ever
reached
me
to
remind
me
that
I
was
heir
to
Otwell
House
and
one
of
the
richest
estates
in
the
country.
In
the
meantime,
I
found
myself
a
bachelor
and
man
about
town,
living
in
a
suite
of
apartments
in
Grosvenor
Mansions,
with
no
occupation
save
that
of
pigeon
shooting
and
polo
playing
at
Hurlingham.
Month
by
month
I
realized
that
it
was
more
and
more
difficult
to
get
the
brokers
to
renew
