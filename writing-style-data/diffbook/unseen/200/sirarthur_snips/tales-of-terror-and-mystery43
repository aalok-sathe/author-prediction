in
his
manner,
but
a
feeling
of
repulsion,
of
unreasoning
horror,
came
upon
me
as
I
looked
at
the
gnarled
old
lump
of
leather.
"I
have
more
than
once
received
important
information
through
my
dreams,"
said
my
companion
in
the
didactic
manner
which
he
loved
to
affect.
"I
make
it
a
rule
now
when
I
am
in
doubt
upon
any
material
point
to
place
the
article
in
question
beside
me
as
I
sleep,
and
to
hope
for
some
enlightenment.
The
process
does
not
appear
to
me
to
be
very
obscure,
though
it
has
not
yet
received
the
blessing
of
orthodox
science.
According
to
my
theory,
any
object
which
has
been
intimately
associated
with
any
supreme
paroxysm
of
human
emotion,
whether
it
be
joy
or
pain,
will
retain
a
certain
atmosphere
or
association
which
it
is
capable
of
communicating
to
a
sensitive
mind.
By
a
sensitive
mind
I
do
not
mean
an
abnormal
one,
but
such
a
trained
and
educated
mind
as
you
or
I
possess."
"You
mean,
for
example,
that
if
I
slept
beside
that
old
sword
upon
the
wall,
I
might
dream
of
some
bloody
incident
in
which
that
very
sword
took
part?"
"An
excellent
example,
for,
as
