and
finally
went
early
to
bed.
And
then
it
was
that,
for
the
first
time,
the
suspicion
that
Lord
Linchmere
was
a
lunatic
crossed
my
mind.
He
followed
me
into
my
bedroom,
when
our
host
had
retired.
"Doctor,"
said
he,
speaking
in
a
low,
hurried
voice,
"you
must
come
with
me.
You
must
spend
the
night
in
my
bedroom."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"I
prefer
not
to
explain.
But
this
is
part
of
your
duties.
My
room
is
close
by,
and
you
can
return
to
your
own
before
the
servant
calls
you
in
the
morning."
"But
why?"
I
asked.
"Because
I
am
nervous
of
being
alone,"
said
he.
"That's
the
reason,
since
you
must
have
a
reason."
It
seemed
rank
lunacy,
but
the
argument
of
those
twenty
pounds
would
overcome
many
objections.
I
followed
him
to
his
room.
"Well,"
said
I,
"there's
only
room
for
one
in
that
bed."
"Only
one
shall
occupy
it,"
said
he.
"And
the
other?"
"Must
remain
on
watch."
"Why?"
said
I.
"One
would
think
you
expected
to
be
attacked."
"Perhaps
I
do."
"In
that
case,
why
not
lock
your
door?"
"Perhaps
I
WANT
to
be
attacked."
It
looked
more
and
more
like
lunacy.
However,
