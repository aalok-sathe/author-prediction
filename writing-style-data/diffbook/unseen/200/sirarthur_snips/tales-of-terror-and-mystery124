the
station,
therefore,
and
made
my
way
to
the
little
town,
which
is
some
ten
miles
away.
Mr.
Picton
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
importance,
as
his
brass
plate
was
displayed
upon
the
door
of
a
considerable
building
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town.
I
was
about
to
ring
his
bell,
when
some
misgiving
came
into
my
mind,
and,
crossing
to
a
neighbouring
shop,
I
asked
the
man
behind
the
counter
if
he
could
tell
me
anything
of
Mr.
Picton.
"Why,"
said
he,
"he
is
the
best
mad
doctor
in
Derbyshire,
and
yonder
is
his
asylum."
You
can
imagine
that
it
was
not
long
before
I
had
shaken
the
dust
of
Castleton
from
my
feet
and
returned
to
the
farm,
cursing
all
unimaginative
pedants
who
cannot
conceive
that
there
may
be
things
in
creation
which
have
never
yet
chanced
to
come
across
their
mole's
vision.
After
all,
now
that
I
am
cooler,
I
can
afford
to
admit
that
I
have
been
no
more
sympathetic
to
Armitage
than
Dr.
Johnson
has
been
to
me.

When
I
was
a
student
I
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
man
of
courage
and
enterprise.
I
remember
that
when
there
was
a
