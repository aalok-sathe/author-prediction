the
open
air.
Like
all
subterranean
life,
it
had
lost
the
power
of
sight,
but
this
had
no
doubt
been
compensated
for
by
nature
in
other
directions.
Certainly
it
had
some
means
of
finding
its
way
about,
and
of
hunting
down
the
sheep
upon
the
hillside.
As
to
its
choice
of
dark
nights,
it
is
part
of
my
theory
that
light
was
painful
to
those
great
white
eyeballs,
and
that
it
was
only
a
pitch
black
world
which
it
could
tolerate.
Perhaps,
indeed,
it
was
the
glare
of
my
lantern
which
saved
my
life
at
that
awful
moment
when
we
were
face

face.
So
I
read
the
riddle.
I
leave
these
facts
behind
me,
and
if
you
can
explain
them,
do
so;
or
if
you
choose
to
doubt
them,
do
so.
Neither
your
belief
nor
your
incredulity
can
alter
them,
nor
affect
one
whose
task
is
nearly
over.
So
ended
the
strange
narrative
of
Dr.
James
Hardcastle.
The
Brazilian
Cat
It
is
hard
luck
on
a
young
fellow
to
have
expensive
tastes,
great
expectations,
aristocratic
connections,
but
no
actual
money
in
his
pocket,
and
no
profession
by
which
he
may
earn
any.
The
fact
was
