"But
when
I
made
my
round
after
daylight
I
had
a
special
look
at
these
stones,
and
I
saw
at
once
that
someone
had
been
meddling
with
them.
Then
I
called
you,
sir,
and
told
you.
I
was
backwards
and
forwards
all
night,
and
I
never
saw
a
soul
or
heard
a
sound."
"Come
up
and
have
some
breakfast
with
me,"
said
Mortimer,
and
he
took
me
into
his
own
chambers.
"Now,
what
DO
you
think
of
this,
Jackson?"
he
asked.
"It
is
the
most
objectless,
futile,
idiotic
business
that
ever
I
heard
of.
It
can
only
be
the
work
of
a
monomaniac."
"Can
you
put
forward
any
theory?"
A
curious
idea
came
into
my
head.
"This
object
is
a
Jewish
relic
of
great
antiquity
and
sanctity,"
said
I.
"How
about
the
anti
Semitic
movement?
Could
one
conceive
that
a
fanatic
of
that
way
of
thinking
might
desecrate
"
"No,
no,
no!"
cried
Mortimer.
"That
will
never
do!
Such
a
man
might
push
his
lunacy
to
the
length
of
destroying
a
Jewish
relic,
but
why
on
earth
should
he
nibble
round
every
stone
so
carefully
that
he
can
only
do
four
stones
in
a
night?
We
must
have
a
better
