bleeding
and
fainting,
I
was
lying
among
the
foul
straw
with
a
line
of
friendly
bars
between
me
and
the
creature
which
ramped
so
frantically
against
them.
Too
wounded
to
move,
and
too
faint
to
be
conscious
of
fear,
I
could
only
lie,
more
dead
than
alive,
and
watch
it.
It
pressed
its
broad,
black
chest
against
the
bars
and
angled
for
me
with
its
crooked
paws
as
I
have
seen
a
kitten
do
before
a
mouse
trap.
It
ripped
my
clothes,
but,
stretch

I
have
heard
of
the
curious
numbing
effect
produced
by
wounds
from
the
great
carnivora,
and
now
I
was
destined
to
experience
it,
for
I
had
lost
all
sense
of
personality,
and
was
as
interested
in
the
cat's
failure
or
success
as
if
it
were
some
game
which
I
was
watching.
And
then
gradually
my
mind
drifted
away
into
strange
vague
dreams,
always
with
that
black
face
and
red
tongue
coming
back
into
them,
and
so
I
lost
myself
in
the
nirvana
of
delirium,
the
blessed
relief
of
those
who
are
too
sorely
tried.
Tracing
the
course
of
events
afterwards,
I
conclude
that
I
must
