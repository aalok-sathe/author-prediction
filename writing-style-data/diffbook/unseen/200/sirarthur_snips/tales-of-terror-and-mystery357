young
face
was
haggard
and
her
bright
eyes
heavy
with
trouble.
"Father
has
gone
to
Scotland,"
she
said.
"He
seems
to
be
tired,
and
has
had
a
good
deal
to
worry
him.
He
only
left
us
yesterday."
"You
look
a
little
tired
yourself,
Miss
Andreas,"
said
my
friend.
"I
have
been
so
anxious
about
father."
"Can
you
give
me
his
Scotch
address?"
"Yes,
he
is
with
his
brother,
the
Rev.
David
Andreas,
1,
Arran
Villas,
Ardrossan."
Ward
Mortimer
made
a
note
of
the
address,
and
we
left
without
saying
anything
as
to
the
object
of
our
visit.
We
found
ourselves
in
Belmore
Street
in
the
evening
in
exactly
the
same
position
in
which
we
had
been
in
the
morning.
Our
only
clue
was
the
Professor's
letter,
and
my
friend
had
made
up
his
mind
to
start
for
Ardrossan
next
day,
and
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
anonymous
letter,
when
a
new
development
came
to
alter
our
plans.
Very
early
on
the
following
morning
I
was
aroused
from
my
sleep
by
a
tap
upon
my
bedroom
door.
It
was
a
messenger
with
a
note
from
Mortimer.
"Do
come
round,"
it
said;
"the
matter
is
becoming
more
and
more
extraordinary."
