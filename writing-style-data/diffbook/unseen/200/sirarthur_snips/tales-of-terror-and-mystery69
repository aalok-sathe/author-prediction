saying
anything
about
a
girl,
but,
as
you
say,
it
is
all
over
Rome,
and
I
don't
suppose
I
can
tell
you
anything
which
you
do
not
know
already.
What
was
it
you
wanted
to
know?"
The
German
came
back
to
the
stove,
and,
laying
down
his
basket,
he
sank
into
his
chair
once
more.
"May
I
have
another
cigar?"
said
he.
"Thank
you
very
much!
I
never
smoke
when
I
work,
but
I
enjoy
a
chat
much
more
when
I
am
under
the
influence
of
tobacco.
Now,
as
regards
this
young
lady,
with
whom
you
had
this
little
adventure.
What
in
the
world
has
become
of
her?"
"She
is
at
home
with
her
own
people."
"Oh,
really
in
England?"
"Yes."
"What
part
of
England
London?"
"No,
Twickenham."
"You
must
excuse
my
curiosity,
my
dear
Kennedy,
and
you
must
put
it
down
to
my
ignorance
of
the
world.
No
doubt
it
is
quite
a
simple
thing
to
persuade
a
young
lady
to
go
off
with
you
for
three
weeks
or
so,
and
then
to
hand
her
over
to
her
own
family
at
what
did
you
call
the
place?"
"Twickenham."
"Quite
so
at
Twickenham.
But
it
is
something
so
entirely
outside
