an
English
September,
and
there
was
the
hush
and
heaviness
of
impending
rain.
Now
and
then
there
came
sudden
puffs
of
wind
from
the
south
west
one
of
them
so
gusty
and
unexpected
that
it
caught
me
napping
and
turned
me
half
round
for
an
instant.
I
remember
the
time
when
gusts
and
whirls
and
air
pockets
used
to
be
things
of
danger
before
we
learned
to
put
an
overmastering
power
into
our
engines.
Just
as
I
reached
the
cloud
banks,
with
the
altimeter
marking
three
thousand,
down
came
the
rain.
My
word,
how
it
poured!
It
drummed
upon
my
wings
and
lashed
against
my
face,
blurring
my
glasses
so
that
I
could
hardly
see.
I
got
down
on
to
a
low
speed,
for
it
was
painful
to
travel
against
it.
As
I
got
higher
it
became
hail,
and
I
had
to
turn
tail
to
it.
One
of
my
cylinders
was
out
of
action
a
dirty
plug,
I
should
imagine,
but
still
I
was
rising
steadily
with
plenty
of
power.
After
a
bit
the
trouble
passed,
whatever
it
was,
and
I
heard
the
full,
deep
throated
purr
the
ten
singing
as
one.
That's
where
the
beauty
of
our
modern
silencers
