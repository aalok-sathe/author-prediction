your

back
to
the
daylight
again.
I
have
not
yet
gone
deeply
into
it,
but
this
very
day
I
stood
at
the
mouth
of
the
arched
tunnel,
and
peering
down
into
the
black
recesses
beyond,
I
vowed
that
when
my
health
returned
I
would
devote
some
holiday
to
exploring
those
mysterious
depths
and
finding
out
for
myself
how
far
the
Roman
had
penetrated
into
the
Derbyshire
hills.
Strange
how
superstitious
these
countrymen
are!
I
should
have
thought
better
of
young
Armitage,
for
he
is
a
man
of
some
education

and
a

said
he,
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
towards
the
black
vault,
"of
the
Terror
that
lives
in
the
Blue
John
Cave."
How
absurdly
easy
it
is
for
a
legend
to
arise
in
a
lonely
countryside!
I
examined
him
as
to
the
reasons
for
his
weird
belief.
It
seems
that
from
time
to
time
sheep
have
been
missing

the
fields,
carried
