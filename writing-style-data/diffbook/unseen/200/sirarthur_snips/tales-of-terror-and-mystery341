forgiveness.
"It
was
only
last
night
that
I
returned
to
England,
and
during
all
this
time
I
have
heard
nothing
of
the
sensation
which
my
supposed
death
had
caused,
nor
of
the
accusation
that
Mr.
Arthur
Morton
had
been
concerned
in
it.
It
was
in
a
late
evening
paper
that
I
read
an
account
of
the
proceedings
of
yesterday,
and
I
have
come
this
morning
as
fast
as
an
express
train
could
bring
me
to
testify
to
the
truth."
Such
was
the
remarkable
statement
of
Dr.
Aloysius
Lana
which
brought
the
trial
to
a
sudden
termination.
A
subsequent
investigation
corroborated
it
to
the
extent
of
finding
out
the
vessel
in
which
his
brother
Ernest
Lana
had
come
over
from
South
America.
The
ship's
doctor
was
able
to
testify
that
he
had
complained
of
a
weak
heart
during
the
voyage,
and
that
his
symptoms
were
consistent
with
such
a
death
as
was
described.
As
to
Dr.
Aloysius
Lana,
he
returned
to
the
village
from
which
he
had
made
so
dramatic
a
disappearance,
and
a
complete
reconciliation
was
effected
between
him
and
the
young
squire,
the
latter
having
acknowledged
that
he
had
entirely
misunderstood
the
other's
motives
in
withdrawing
from
his
