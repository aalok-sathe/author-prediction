and
she
had
three
medical
students
and
one
engineer
as
lodgers.
I
occupied
the
top
room,
which
was
the
cheapest,
but
cheap
as
it
was
it
was
more
than
I
could
afford.
My
small
resources
were
dwindling
away,
and
every
week
it
became
more
necessary
that
I
should
find
something
to

when
my
eyes
were
caught
by
an
advertisement
at
the
head
of
the
personal
column.
It
was
worded
in
this
way:
