out.
"My
dear
Thomas,
how
are
you?"
said
he,
heartily.
But
the
heartiness
was
by
no
means
reciprocal.
The
owner
of
the
grounds
glared
at
me
over
his
brother
in
law's
shoulder,
and
I
caught
broken
scraps
of
sentences
"well
known
wishes
...
hatred
of
strangers
...
unjustifiable
intrusion
...
perfectly
inexcusable."
Then
there
was
a
muttered
explanation,
and
the
two
of
them
came
over
together
to
the
side
of
the
fly.
"Let
me
present
you
to
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter,
Dr.
Hamilton,"
said
Lord
Linchmere.
"You
will
find
that
you
have
a
strong
community
of
tastes."
I
bowed.
Sir
Thomas
stood
very
stiffly,
looking
at
me
severely
from
under
the
broad
brim
of
his
hat.
"Lord
Linchmere
tells
me
that
you
know
something
about
beetles,"
said
he.
"What
do
you
know
about
beetles?"
"I
know
what
I
have
learned
from
your
work
upon
the
coleoptera,
Sir
Thomas,"
I
answered.
"Give
me
the
names
of
the
better
known
species
of
the
British
scarabaei,"
said
he.
I
had
not
expected
an
examination,
but
fortunately
I
was
ready
for
one.
My
answers
seemed
to
please
him,
for
his
stern
features
relaxed.
"You
appear
to
have
read
my
book
with
some
profit,
sir,"
said
