Dr.
Lana
at
a
garden
party,
and
a
friendship,
which
quickly
ripened
into
love,
sprang
up
between
them.
Nothing
could
exceed
their
devotion
to
each
other.
There
was
some
discrepancy
in
age,
he
being
thirty
seven,
and
she
twenty
four;
but,
save
in
that
one
respect,
there
was
no
possible
objection
to
be
found
with
the
match.
The
engagement
was
in
February,
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
in
August.
Upon
the
3rd
of
June
Dr.
Lana
received
a
letter
from
abroad.
In
a
small
village
the
postmaster
is
also
in
a
position
to
be
the
gossip
master,
and
Mr.
Bankley,
of
Bishop's
Crossing,
had
many
of
the
secrets
of
his
neighbours
in
his
possession.
Of
this
particular
letter
he
remarked
only
that
it
was
in
a
curious
envelope,
that
it
was
in
a
man's
handwriting,
that
the
postscript
was
Buenos
Ayres,
and
the
stamp
of
the
Argentine
Republic.
It
was
the
first
letter
which
he
had
ever
known
Dr.
Lana
to
have
from
abroad
and
this
was
the
reason
why
his
attention
was
particularly
called
to
it
before
he
handed
it
to
the
local
postman.
It
was
delivered
by
the
evening
delivery
of
that
date.
