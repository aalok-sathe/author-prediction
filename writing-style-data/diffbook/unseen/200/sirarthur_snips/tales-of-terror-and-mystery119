for
my
disease.
Gradually,
lulled
by
the
monotonous
gurgle
of
the
stream,
and
by
the
absolute
darkness,
I
sank
into
an
uneasy
slumber.
How
long
this
lasted
I
cannot
say.
It
may
have
been
for
an
hour,
it
may
have
been
for
several.
Suddenly
I
sat
up
on
my
rock
couch,
with
every
nerve
thrilling
and
every
sense
acutely
on
the
alert.
Beyond
all
doubt
I
had
heard
a
sound
some
sound
very
distinct
from
the
gurgling
of
the
waters.
It
had
passed,
but
the
reverberation
of
it
still
lingered
in
my
ear.
Was
it
a
search
party?
They
would
most
certainly
have
shouted,
and
vague

this
sound
was
which
had
wakened

was
very

from
the
human
voice.
I
sat
palpitating
and
hardly
daring
to
breathe.
There
it
was
again!
And
again!
Now
it
had
become
continuous.
It
was
a
tread
yes,
surely
it
was
the
tread
of
some
living
creature.
But
what
a
tread
it
was!
It
gave
one
the
impression
of
enormous
weight
carried
upon
sponge
like
feet,
which
gave
forth
a
muffled
but
ear
filling
sound.
The
darkness
was
as
complete
as
ever,
but
the
tread
was
regular
and
decisive.
And
it
was
