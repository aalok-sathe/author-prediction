of
a
bravo
and
a
bully.
There
was
evidence
to
show,
however,
that
he
was
honestly
devoted
to
the
interests
of
Monsieur
Caratal,
and
that
the
latter,
being
a
man
of
puny
physique,
employed
the
other
as
a
guard
and
protector.
It
may
be
added
that
no
information
came
from
Paris
as
to
what
the
objects
of
Monsieur
Caratal's
hurried
journey
may
have
been.
This
comprises
all
the
facts
of
the
case
up
to
the
publication
in
the
Marseilles
papers
of
the
recent
confession
of
Herbert
de
Lernac,
now
under
sentence
of
death
for
the
murder
of
a
merchant
named
Bonvalot.
This
statement
may
be
literally
translated
as
follows:
"It
is
not
out
of
mere
pride
or
boasting
that
I
give
this
information,
for,
if
that
were
my
object,
I
could
tell
a
dozen
actions
of
mine
which
are
quite
as
splendid;
but
I
do
it
in
order
that
certain
gentlemen
in
Paris
may
understand
that
I,
who
am
able
here
to
tell
about
the
fate
of
Monsieur
Caratal,
can
also
tell
in
whose
interest
and
at
whose
request
the
deed
was
done,
unless
the
reprieve
which
I
am
awaiting
comes
to
me
very
quickly.
Take
warning,
messieurs,
before
it
