idea
occur
to
me
that
people
might
think
that
I
had
been
murdered,
nor
did
I
imagine
that
anyone
might
be
caused
serious
danger
through
this
stratagem
by
which
I
endeavoured
to
gain
a
fresh
start
in
the
world.
On
the
contrary,
it
was
the
thought
of
relieving
others
from
the
burden
of
my
presence
which
was
always
uppermost
in
my
mind.
A
sailing
vessel
was
leaving
Liverpool
that
very
day
for
Corunna,
and
in
this
I
took
my
passage,
thinking
that
the
voyage
would
give
me
time
to
recover
my
balance,
and
to
consider
the
future.
But
before
I
left
my
resolution
softened.
I
bethought
me
that
there
was
one
person
in
the
world
to
whom
I
would
not
cause
an
hour
of
sadness.
She
would
mourn
me
in
her
heart,
however
harsh
and
unsympathetic
her
relatives
might
be.
She
understood
and
appreciated
the
motives
upon
which
I
had
acted,
and
if
the
rest
of
her
family
condemned
me,
she,
at
least,
would
not
forget.
And
so
I
sent
her
a
note
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
to
save
her
from
a
baseless
grief.
If
under
the
pressure
of
events
she
broke
that
seal,
she
has
my
entire
sympathy
