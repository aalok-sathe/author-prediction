the
very
image
of
craft
and
of
caution.
Once
some
sound
in
the
street
struck
him
motionless,
and
he
stood
listening,
with
his
ear
turned,
ready
to
dart
back
to
the
shelter
behind
him.
Then
he
crept
onwards
again
upon
tiptoe,
very,
very
softly
and
slowly,
until
he
had
reached
the
case
in
the
centre
of
the
room.
There
he
took
a
bunch
of
keys
from
his
pocket,
unlocked
the
case,
took
out
the
Jewish
breastplate,
and,
laying

which
he
had
begun.
I
could
realize
from
the
heavy
breathing
of
my
companion,
and
the
twitchings
of
the
hand
which
still
clutched
my
wrist,
the
furious
indignation
which
filled
his
heart
as
he
saw
this
vandalism
in
the
quarter
of
all
others
where
he
could
least
have
expected
it.
He,
the
very
man
who
a
fortnight
before
had
reverently
bent
over
this
unique
relic,
and
who
had
impressed
