come
back
to
that
wonderful
Jewish
relic,
and
my
mind
to
the
singular
mystery
which
surrounded
it.
I
was
lost
in
the
thought
of
it
when
my
companion
suddenly
drew
his
breath
sharply
in,
and
seized
my
arm
in
a
convulsive
grip.
At
the
same
instant
I
saw
what
it
was
which
had
excited
him.
I
have
said
that
against
the
wall
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
doorway
(the
right
hand
side
as
we
looked
at
it,
but
the
left
as
one
entered)
there
stood
a
large
mummy
case.
To
our
unutterable
amazement
it
was
slowly
opening.
Gradually,
gradually
the
lid
was
swinging
back,
and
the
black
slit
which
marked
the
opening
was
becoming
wider
and
wider.
So
gently
and
carefully
was
it
done
that
the
movement
was
almost
imperceptible.
Then,
as
we
breathlessly
watched
it,
a
white
thin
hand
appeared
at
the
opening,
pushing
back
the
painted
lid,
then
another
hand,
and
finally
a
face
a
face
which
was
familiar
to
us
both,
that
of
Professor
Andreas.
Stealthily
he
slunk
out
of
the
mummy
case,
like
a
fox
stealing
from
its
burrow,
his
head
turning
incessantly
to
left
and
to
right,
stepping,
then
pausing,
then
stepping
again,
