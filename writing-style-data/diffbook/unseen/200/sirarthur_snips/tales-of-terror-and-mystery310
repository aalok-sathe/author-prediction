Next
morning
that
is,
upon
the
4th
of
June
Dr.
Lana
called
upon
Miss
Morton,
and
a
long
interview
followed,
from
which
he
was
observed
to
return
in
a
state
of
great
agitation.
Miss
Morton
remained
in
her
room
all
that
day,
and
her
maid
found
her
several
times
in
tears.
In
the
course
of
a
week
it
was
an
open
secret
to
the
whole
village
that
the
engagement
was
at
an
end,
that
Dr.
Lana
had
behaved
shamefully
to
the
young
lady,
and
that
Arthur
Morton,
her
brother,
was
talking
of
horse
whipping
him.
In
what
particular
respect
the
doctor
had
behaved
badly
was
unknown
some
surmised
one
thing
and
some
another;
but
it
was
observed,
and
taken
as
the
obvious
sign
of
a
guilty
conscience,
that
he
would
go
for
miles
round
rather
than
pass
the
windows
of
Leigh
Hall,
and
that
he
gave
up
attending
morning
service
upon
Sundays
where
he
might
have
met
the
young
lady.
There
was
an
advertisement
also
in
the
Lancet
as
to
the
sale
of
a
practice
which
mentioned
no
names,
but
which
was
thought
by
some
to
refer
to
Bishop's
Crossing,
and
to
mean
that
Dr.
Lana
was
thinking
of
abandoning
