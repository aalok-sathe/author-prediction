guard
was
about
to
give
the
customary
signal
to
the
engine
driver
when
he
observed
two
belated
passengers
hurrying
down
the
platform.
The
one
was
an
exceptionally
tall
man,
dressed
in
a
long
black
overcoat
with
astrakhan
collar
and
cuffs.
I
have
already
said
that
the
evening
was
an
inclement
one,
and
the
tall
traveller
had
the
high,
warm
collar
turned
up
to
protect
his
throat
against
the
bitter
March
wind.
He
appeared,
as

as
the
guard
could
judge

the
vigour
and

of
his
youth.
In
one
hand
he
carried
a
brown
leather
Gladstone
bag.
His
companion
was
a
lady,
tall
and
erect,
walking
with
a
vigorous
step
which
outpaced
the
gentleman
beside
her.
She
wore
a
long,
fawn
coloured
dust
cloak,
a
black,
close
fitting
toque,
and
a
dark
veil
which
concealed
the
greater
part
of
her
face.
The
two
might
very
well
have
passed
as
father
and
daughter.
They
walked
swiftly
down
the
line
of
carriages,
glancing
in
at
the
windows,
until
the
guard,
John
Palmer,
overtook
them.
"Now
then,
sir,
look
sharp,
