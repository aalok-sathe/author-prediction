no
signs
of
robbery,
and
the
doctor's
gold
watch
was
safe
in
his
pocket.
He
kept
a
heavy
cash
box
in
the
room,
and
this
was
discovered
to
be
locked
but
empty.
Mrs.
Woods
had
an
impression
that
a
large
sum
was
usually
kept
there,
but
the
doctor
had
paid
a
heavy
corn
bill
in
cash
only
that
very
day,
and
it
was
conjectured
that
it
was
to
this
and
not
to
a
robber
that
the
emptiness
of
the
box
was
due.
One
thing
in
the
room
was
missing
but
that
one
thing
was
suggestive.
The
portrait
of
Miss
Morton,
which
had
always
stood
upon
the
side

had
been
taken
from
its
frame,
and
carried
off.
Mrs.
Woods
had
observed
it
there
when
she
waited
upon
her
employer
that
evening,
and
now
it
was
gone.
On
the
other
hand,
there
was
picked
up
from
the
floor
a
green
eye
patch,
which
the
housekeeper
could
not
remember
to
have
seen
before.
Such
a
patch
might,
however,
be
in
the
possession
of
a
doctor,
and
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
it
was
in
any
way
connected
with
the
crime.
Suspicion
could
only
turn
in
one
direction,
and
