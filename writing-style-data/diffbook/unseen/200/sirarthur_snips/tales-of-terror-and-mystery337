a
long
time
I
sat
as
if
I
were
in
some
dreadful
dream,
staring
at
the
body
of
my
brother.
I
was
aroused
by
the
knocking
of
Mrs.
Woods,
who
had
been
disturbed
by
that
dying
cry.
I
sent
her
away
to
bed.
Shortly
afterwards
a
patient
tapped
at
the
surgery
door,
but
as
I
took
no
notice,
he
or
she
went
off
again.
Slowly
and
gradually
as
I
sat
there
a
plan
was
forming
itself
in
my
head
in
the
curious
automatic
way
in
which
plans
do
form.
When
I
rose
from
my
chair
my
future
movements
were
finally
decided
upon
without
my
having
been
conscious
of
any
process
of
thought.
It
was
an
instinct
which
irresistibly
inclined
me
towards
one
course.
"Ever
since
that
change
in
my
affairs
to
which
I
have
alluded,
Bishop's
Crossing
had
become
hateful
to
me.
My
plans
of
life
had
been
ruined,
and
I
had
met
with
hasty
judgments
and
unkind
treatment
where
I
had
expected
sympathy.
It
is
true
that
any
danger
of
scandal
from
my
brother
had
passed
away
with
his
life;
but
still,
I
was
sore
about
the
past,
and
felt
that
things
could
never
be
as
they
had
been.
