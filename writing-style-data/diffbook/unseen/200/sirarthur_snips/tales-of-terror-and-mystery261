by
no
means
so
perilous
as
it
might
appear.
"Having
now
got
our
young
man,
without
his
ticket,
into
the
carriage
in
which
the
elder
man
and
the
young
woman
are
travelling,
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
that
a
violent
scene
ensued.
It
is
possible
that
the
pair
were
also
Americans,
which
is
the
more
probable
as
the
man
carried
a
weapon
an
unusual
thing
in
England.
If
our
supposition
of
incipient
mania
is
correct,
the
young
man
is
likely
to
have
assaulted
the
other.
As
the
upshot
of
the
quarrel
the
elder
man
shot
the
intruder,
and
then
made
his
escape
from
the
carriage,
taking
the
young
lady
with
him.
We
will
suppose
that
all
this
happened
very
rapidly,
and
that
the
train
was
still
going
at
so
slow
a
pace
that
it
was
not
difficult
for
them
to
leave
it.
A
woman
might
leave
a
train
going
at
eight
miles
an
hour.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
we
know
that
this
woman
DID
do
so.
"And
now
we
have
to
fit
in
the
man
in
the
smoking
carriage.
Presuming
that
we
have,
up
to
this
point,
reconstructed
the
tragedy
correctly,
we
shall
find
nothing
in
this
other
