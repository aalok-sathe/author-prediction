antiquity
and
its
sanctity
upon
us,
was
now
engaged
in
this
outrageous
profanation.
It
was
impossible,
unthinkable
and
yet
there,
in
the
white
glare
of
the
electric
light
beneath
us,
was
that
dark
figure
with
the
bent
grey
head,
and
the
twitching
elbow.
What
inhuman
hypocrisy,
what
hateful
depth
of
malice
against
his
successor
must
underlie
these
sinister
nocturnal
labours.
It
was
painful
to
think
of
and
dreadful

Even
I,

quarters
that
he
opened
his
lips,
and
then
I
saw
by
his
agitated
face
how
deep
was
his
consternation.
"The
abominable
Goth!"
he
cried.
"Could
you
have
believed
it?"
"It
is
amazing."
"He
is
a
villain
or
a
lunatic
one
or
the
other.
We
shall
very
soon
see
which.
Come
with
me,
Jackson,
and
we
shall
get
