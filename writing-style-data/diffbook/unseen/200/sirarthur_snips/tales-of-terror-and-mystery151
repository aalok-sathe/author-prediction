but
when
he
does
he
will
be
a
terror.
At
present
he
won't
stand
anyone
but
me
in
his
den.
Even
Baldwin,
the
groom,
dare
not
go
near
him.
As
to
me,
I
am
his
mother
and
father
in
one."
As
he
spoke
he
suddenly,
to
my
astonishment,
opened
the
door
and
slipped
in,
closing
it
instantly
behind
him.
At
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
huge,
lithe
creature
rose,
yawned
and
rubbed
its
round,
black
head
affectionately
against
his
side,
while
he
patted
and
fondled
it.
"Now,
Tommy,
into
your
cage!"
said
he.
The
monstrous
cat
walked
over
to
one
side
of
the
room
and
coiled
itself
up
under
a
grating.
Everard
King
came
out,
and
taking
the
iron
handle
which
I
have
mentioned,
he
began
to
turn
it.
As
he
did
so
the
line
of
bars
in
the
corridor
began
to
pass
through
a
slot
in
the
wall
and
closed
up
the
front
of
this
grating,
so
as
to
make
an
effective
cage.
When
it
was
in
position
he
opened
the
door
once
more
and
invited
me
into
the
room,
which
was
heavy
with
the
pungent,
musty
smell
peculiar
to
the
great
carnivora.
"That's
how
we
work
it,"
