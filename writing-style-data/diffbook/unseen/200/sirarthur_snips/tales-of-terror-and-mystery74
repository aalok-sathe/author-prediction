"All
right,
Burger!
I
think
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
let
me
into
this
secret,
and
I
promise
you
that
I
will
write
nothing
about
it
until
you
have
published
your
report.
Good
bye
for
the
present!
You
will
find
me
at
the
Gate
at
twelve."
The
cold,
clear
air
was
filled
with
the
musical
chimes
from
that
city
of
clocks
as
Burger,
wrapped
in
an
Italian
overcoat,
with
a
lantern
hanging
from
his
hand,
walked
up
to
the
rendezvous.
Kennedy
stepped
out
of
the
shadow
to
meet
him.
"You
are
ardent
in
work
as
well
as
in
love!"
said
the
German,
laughing.
"Yes;
I
have
been
waiting
here
for
nearly
half
an
hour."
"I
hope
you
left
no
clue
as
to
where
we
were
going."
"Not
such
a
fool!
By
Jove,
I
am
chilled
to
the
bone!
Come
on,
Burger,
let
us
warm
ourselves
by
a
spurt
of
hard
walking."
Their
footsteps
sounded
loud
and
crisp
upon
the
rough
stone
paving
of
the
disappointing
road
which
is
all
that
is
left
of
the
most
famous
highway
of
the
world.
