Then
he
approached
a
case
which
stood
in
the
very
centre
of
the
hall,
and
he
looked
down
through
the
glass
with
reverence
in
his
attitude
and
manner.
"This
is
no
novelty
to
an
expert
like
yourself,
Mr.
Mortimer,"
said
he;
"but
I
daresay
that
your
friend,
Mr.
Jackson,
will
be
interested
to
see
it."
Leaning
over
the
case
I
saw
an
object,
some
five
inches
square,
which
consisted
of
twelve
precious
stones
in
a
framework
of
gold,
with
golden
hooks
at
two
of
the
corners.
The
stones
were
all
varying
in
sort
and
colour,
but
they
were
of
the
same
size.
Their
shapes,
arrangement,
and
gradation
of
tint
made
me
think
of
a
box
of
water
colour
paints.
Each
stone
had
some
hieroglyphic
scratched
upon
its
surface.
"You
have
heard,
Mr.
Jackson,
of
the
urim
and
thummim?"
I
had
heard
the
term,
but
my
idea
of
its
meaning
was
exceedingly
vague.
"The
urim
and
thummim
was
a
name
given
to
the
jewelled
plate
which
lay
upon
the
breast
of
the
high
priest
of
the
Jews.
They
had
a
very
special
feeling
of
reverence
for
it
something
of
the
feeling
which
an
ancient
Roman
might
have
for
the
Sibylline
books
