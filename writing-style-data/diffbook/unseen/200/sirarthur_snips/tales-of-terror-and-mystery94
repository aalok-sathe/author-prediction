all
that
is
known
I
know,
for
my
father
was
in
this
trade
before
me,
and
we
have
had
much
to
do
with
these
poisoned
weapons."
"What
are
the
symptoms?"
"Deep
sleep,
and
death
in
thirty
hours."
"And
you
say
there
is
no
cure.
Why
then
should
you
pay
me
this
considerable
fee?"
"No
drug
can
cure,
but
the
knife
may."
"And
how?"
"The
poison
is
slow
of
absorption.
It
remains
for
hours
in
the
wound."
"Washing,
then,
might
cleanse
it?"
"No
more
than
in
a
snake
bite.
It
is
too
subtle
and
too
deadly."
"Excision
of
the
wound,
then?"
"That
is
it.
If
it
be
on
the
finger,
take
the
finger
off.
So
said
my
father
always.
But
think
of
where
this
wound
is,
and
that
it
is
my
wife.
It
is
dreadful!"
But
familiarity
with
such
grim
matters
may
take
the
finer
edge
from
a
man's
sympathy.
To
Douglas
Stone
this
was
already
an
interesting
case,
and
he
brushed
aside
as
irrelevant
the
feeble
objections
of
the
husband.
"It
appears
to
be
that
or
nothing,"
said
he
brusquely.
"It
is
better
to
lose
a
lip
than
a
life."
"Ah,
yes,
I
know
that
you
are
right.
Well,
well,
