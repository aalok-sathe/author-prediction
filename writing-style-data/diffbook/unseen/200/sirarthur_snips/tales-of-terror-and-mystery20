and
I
had
come
to
the
apex.
With
a
terrific
wrench,
throwing
my
weight
all
to
one
side,
I
levelled
my
planes
and
brought
her
head
away
from
the
wind.
In
an
instant
I
had
shot
out
of
the
eddies
and
was
skimming
down
the
sky.
Then,
shaken
but
victorious,
I
turned
her
nose
up
and
began
once
more
my
steady
grind
on
the
upward
spiral.
I
took
a
large
sweep
to
avoid
the
danger

I
was
safely
above
it.
Just
after
one

I
was
twenty

above
the
sea

To
my
great
joy
I
had

gale,
and
with
every

air
grew
stiller.
On
the
other
hand,
it
was
very
cold,
and
I
was
conscious
of

peculiar
nausea
which
goes
with
rarefaction
of
the
air.
For
the
first
time
I
unscrewed
the
mouth
of
my
oxygen
bag
and
took
an
occasional
whiff
of
the
glorious
gas.
I
could
feel
it
running
like
a
cordial
through
my
veins,
and
I
was
exhilarated
almost
to
the
point
of
drunkenness.
I
shouted
and
sang
as
I
soared
upwards
into
the
cold,
still
outer
world.
