the
matter
was
full
of
difficulty.
He
is
a
recluse
in
his
habits,
and
would
not
see
any
medical
man.
Besides,
it
was
necessary
for
our
purpose
that
the
medical
man
should
convince
himself
of
his
insanity;
and
he
is
sane
as
you
or
I,
save
on
these
very

occasions.
But,
fortunately,
before

warning

The

on
some
pretext,
and
took

in
my
house
in
Brook
Street.
"It

of
Sir
Thomas's
insanity,
without
which
it
was
impossible
to
put
him
where
he
could
do
no
harm.
The
first
problem
was
how
to
get
a
medical
man
into
his
house.
I
bethought
me
of
his
interest
in
beetles,
and
his
love
for
anyone
who
shared
his
tastes.
I
advertised,
