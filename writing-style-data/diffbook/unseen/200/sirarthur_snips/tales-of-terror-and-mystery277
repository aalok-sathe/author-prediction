blood
of
two
of
you
on
my
hands
in
one
day.
You
loved
your
brother,
I've
no
doubt;
but
you
didn't
love
him
a
cent
more
than
I
loved
him,
though
you'll
say
that
I
took
a
queer
way
to
show
it.
Anyhow,
it
seems
a
mighty
empty
world
now
that
he
is
gone,
and
I
don't
care
a
continental
whether
you
give
me
over
to
the
hangman
or
not.'
"He
had
turned
his
ankle
in
the
fall,
and
there
we
sat,
he
with
his
useless
foot,
and
I
with
my
throbbing
head,
and
we
talked
and
talked
until
gradually
my
bitterness
began
to
soften
and
to
turn
into
something
like
sympathy.
What
was
the
use
of
revenging
his
death
upon
a
man
who
was
as
much
stricken
by
that
death
as
I
was?
And
then,
as
my
wits
gradually
returned,
I
began
to
realize
also
that
I
could
do
nothing
against
MacCoy
which
would
not
recoil
upon
my
mother
and
myself.
How
could
we
convict
him
without
a
full
account
of
my
brother's
career
being
made
public
the
very
thing
which
of
all
others
we
wished
to
avoid?
It
was
really
as
much
our
interest
as
his
to
cover
