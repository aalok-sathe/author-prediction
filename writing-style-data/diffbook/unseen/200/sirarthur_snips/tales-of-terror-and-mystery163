then
they
would
widen
and
widen
until
all
that
corner
of
the
room
was
filled
with
their
shifting
and
sinister
light.
And
then
suddenly
they
went
out
altogether.
The
beast
had
closed
its
eyes.
I
do
not
know
whether
there
may
be
any
truth
in
the
old
idea
of
the
dominance
of
the
human
gaze,
or
whether
the
huge
cat
was
simply
drowsy,
but
the
fact
remains
that,
far
from
showing
any
symptom
of
attacking
me,
it
simply
rested
its
sleek,
black
head
upon
its
huge
forepaws
and
seemed
to
sleep.
I
stood,
fearing
to
move
lest
I
should
rouse
it
into
malignant
life
once
more.
But
at
least
I
was
able
to
think
clearly
now
that
the
baleful
eyes
were
off
me.
Here
I
was
shut
up
for
the
night
with
the
ferocious
beast.
My
own
instincts,
to
say
nothing
of
the
words
of
the
plausible
villain
who
laid
this
trap
for
me,
warned
me
that
the
animal
was
as
savage
as
its
master.
How
could
I
stave
it
off
until
morning?
The
door
was
hopeless,
and
so
were
the
narrow,
barred
windows.
There
was
no
shelter
anywhere
in
the
bare,
stone
flagged
room.
To
cry
for
assistance
was
