The
Carnstock
Iron
Works
line
was
blocked
all
day
upon
the
3rd
of
June
by
sixteen
truckloads
of
hematite.
It
is
a
single
line,
and
nothing
could
have
passed.
As
to
the
Perseverance
line,
it
is
a
large
double
line,
which
does
a
considerable
traffic,
for
the
output
of
the
mine
is
very
large.
On
the
3rd
of
June
this
traffic
proceeded
as
usual;
hundreds
of
men
including
a
gang
of
railway
platelayers
were
working
along
the
two
miles
and
a
quarter
which
constitute
the
total
length
of
the
line,
and
it
is
inconceivable
that
an
unexpected
train
could
have
come
down
there
without
attracting
universal
attention.
It
may
be
remarked
in
conclusion
that
this
branch
line
is
nearer
to
St.
Helens
than
the
point
at
which
the
engine
driver
was
discovered,
so
that
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
train
was
past
that
point
before
misfortune
overtook
her.
"As
to
John
Slater,
there
is
no
clue
to
be
gathered
from
his
appearance
or
injuries.
We
can
only
say
that,
so
far
as
we
can
see,
he
met
his
end
by
falling
off
his
engine,
though
why
he
fell,
or
what
became
of
the
engine
after
his
