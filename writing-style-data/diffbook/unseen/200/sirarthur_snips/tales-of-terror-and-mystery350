enough
to
insure
you
against
robbery?"
"I
should
have
thought
so.
The
public
are
only
admitted
from
ten
till
five,
and
there
is
a
guardian
to
every
two
rooms.
He
stands
at
the
door
between
them,
and
so
commands
them
both."
"But
at
night?"
"When
the
public
are
gone,
we
at
once
put
up
the
great
iron
shutters,
which
are
absolutely
burglar
proof.
The
watchman
is
a
capable
fellow.
He
sits
in
the
lodge,
but
he
walks
round
every
three
hours.
We
keep
one
electric
light
burning
in
each
room
all
night."
"It
is
difficult
to
suggest
anything
more
short
of
keeping
your
day
watches
all
night."
"We
could
not
afford
that."
"At
least,
I
should
communicate
with
the
police,
and
have
a
special
constable
put
on
outside
in
Belmore
Street,"
said
I.
"As
to
the
letter,
if
the
writer
wishes
to
be
anonymous,
I
think
he
has
a
right
to
remain
so.
We
must
trust
to
the
future
to
show
some
reason
for
the
curious
course
which
he
has
adopted."
So
we
dismissed
the
subject,
but
all
that
night
after
my
return
to
my
chambers
I
was
puzzling
my
brain
as
to
what
possible
motive
Professor
Andreas
could
have
