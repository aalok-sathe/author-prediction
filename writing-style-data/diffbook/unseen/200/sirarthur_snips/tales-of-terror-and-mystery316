front
door,
roused
Mrs.
Woods,
the
housekeeper,
and
the
two
women
made
their
way
into
the
study,
having
first
dispatched
the
maidservant
to
the
police
station.
At
the
side
of
the
table,
away
from
the
window,
Dr.
Lana
was
discovered
stretched
upon
his
back
and
quite
dead.
It
was
evident
that
he
had
been
subjected
to
violence,
for
one

A

by
the
murderer.
It
was
evident
that
someone
had
entered
by
the
surgery
door,
had
killed
the
doctor,
and
had
then
made
his
escape
unseen.
That
the
assailant
was
a
man
was
certain,
from
the
size
of
the
footprints
and
from
the
nature
of
the
injuries.
But
beyond
that
point
the
police
found
it
very
difficult
