It
would
have
been
very
agreeable
if
we
could
have
done
so,
but
business
is
business.
Besides,
the
train
was
now
as
much
beyond
our
controls
as
theirs.
"He
ceased
howling
when
the
train
rattled
round
the
curve
and
they
saw
the
black
mouth
of
the
mine
yawning
before
them.
We
had
removed
the
boards
which
had
covered
it,
and
we
had
cleared
the
square
entrance.
The
rails
had

coal,
and

but
they
had
both
been
struck
silent
by
what
they
saw.
And
yet
they
could
not
withdraw
their
heads.
The
sight
seemed
to
have
paralysed
them.
"I
had
wondered
how
the
train
running
at
a
great
speed
would
take
the
pit
into
which
I
had
guided
it,
and
I
was
much
interested
in
watching

One
