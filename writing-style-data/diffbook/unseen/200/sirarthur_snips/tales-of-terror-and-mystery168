from
my
terrible
position.
That
was
the
contemplation
of
my
cousin's
villainy,
his
unparalleled
hypocrisy,
his
malignant
hatred
of
me.
Beneath
that
cheerful
face
there
lurked
the
spirit
of
a
mediaeval
assassin.
And
as
I
thought
of
it
I
saw
more
clearly
how
cunningly
the
thing
had
been
arranged.
He
had
apparently
gone
to
bed
with
the
others.
No
doubt
he
had
his
witness
to
prove
it.
Then,
unknown

How

such
a
crime
be
brought
home
to
him?
Suspicion,
perhaps
but
proof,
never!
How
slowly
those
dreadful
two
hours
went
by!
Once
I
heard
a
low,
rasping
sound,
which
I
took
to
be
the
creature
licking
its
own
fur.
Several
times
those
greenish
eyes
gleamed
at
me
through
the
darkness,
but
never
in
a
fixed
stare,
and
my
hopes
grew
stronger
that
