in
the
study.
She
therefore
tapped
at
the
surgery
door.
There
was
no
answer.
She
repeated
the
knocking
several
times
without
effect.
It
appeared
to
her
to
be
unlikely
that
the
doctor
would
either
go
to
bed
or
go
out
leaving
so
brilliant
a
light
behind
him,
and
it
struck
Mrs.
Madding
that
it
was
possible
that
he
might
have
dropped
asleep
in
his
chair.
She
tapped
at
the
study
window,
therefore,
but
without
result.
Then,
finding
that
there
was
an
opening
between
the
curtain
and
the
woodwork,
she
looked
through.
The
small
room
was
brilliantly
lighted
from
a
large
lamp
on
the
central
table,
which
was
littered
with
the
doctor's
books
and
instruments.
No
one
was
visible,
nor
did
she
see
anything
unusual,
except
that
in
the
farther
shadow
thrown
by
the
table
a
dingy
white
glove
was
lying
upon
the
carpet.
And
then
suddenly,
as
her
eyes
became
more
accustomed
to
the
light,
a
boot
emerged
from
the
other
end
of
the
shadow,
and
she
realized,
with
a
thrill
of
horror,
that
what
she
had
taken
to
be
a
glove
was
the
hand
of
a
man,
who
was
prostrate
upon
the
floor.
Understanding
that
something
terrible
had
occurred,
