in
the
other
a
small
chamois
leather
bag.
"Good
evening,"
said
Douglas
Stone,
when
the
butler
had
closed
the
door.
"You
speak
English,
I
presume?"
"Yes,
sir.
I
am
from
Asia
Minor,
but
I
speak
English
when
I
speak
slow."
"You
wanted
me
to
go
out,
I
understand?"
"Yes,
sir.
I
wanted
very
much
that
you
should
see
my
wife."
"I
could
come
in
the
morning,
but
I
have
an
engagement
which
prevents
me
from
seeing
your
wife
tonight."
The
Turk's
answer
was
a
singular
one.
He
pulled
the
string
which
closed
the
mouth
of
the
chamois
leather
bag,
and
poured

of
gold
on
to
the
table.
"There
are
one

"and

promise
you
that
it
will
not
take
you
an
hour.
I
have
a
cab
ready
at
the
door."
Douglas
Stone
glanced
at
his
watch.
An
hour
would
not
make
it
too
late
to
visit
Lady
Sannox.
He
had
been
there
later.
And
the
fee
was
an
extraordinarily
high
one.
He
had
been
pressed
by
his
creditors
lately,
and
he
could
not
afford
to
let
such
a
chance
pass.
He
would
go.
"What
is
the
case?"
he
asked.
"Oh,
it
is
so
