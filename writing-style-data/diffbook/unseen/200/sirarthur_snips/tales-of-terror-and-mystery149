deaths,
and
he
would
cry
out
in
his
delight,
like
a
schoolboy,
when,
as
we
walked,
some
gaudy
bird
would
flutter
up
from
the
grass,
or
some
curious
beast
slink
into
the
cover.
Finally
he
led
me
down
a
corridor
which
extended
from
one
wing
of
the
house.
At
the
end
of
this
there
was
a
heavy
door
with
a
sliding
shutter

"You
will
soon
see
that,"
said
he,
laughing.
"Will
you
kindly
draw
that
shutter
and
look
through?"
I
did
so,
and
found
that
I
was
gazing
into
a
large,
empty
room,
with
stone
flags,
and
small,
barred
windows
upon
the
farther
wall.
In
the
centre
of
this
room,
lying
in
the
middle
of
a
golden
patch
of
sunlight,
there
was
stretched
a
huge
