the
man's
linen,
which
appeared
to
be
new,
and
no
tailor's
name
upon
his
coat.
In
appearance
he
was
young,
short,
smooth
cheeked,
and
delicately
featured.
One
of
his
front
teeth
was
conspicuously
stopped
with
gold.
On
the
discovery
of
the
tragedy
an
examination
was
instantly
made
of
the
tickets
of
all
passengers,
and
the
number
of
the
passengers

It

that
only
three
tickets
were

the
railway
company,
an
exhaustive
inquiry
was
made
into
all
the
circumstances.
That
crime
had
been
committed
was
certain.
The
bullet,
which
appeared
to
have
come
from
a
small
pistol
or
revolver,
had
been
fired
from
some
little
distance,
as
there
was
no
scorching
of
the
clothes.
No
weapon
was
found
in
