soon
had
one
of
the
acutest
brains
in
England
to
assist
me.
I
will
mention
no
names,
but
it
would
be
unjust
to
claim
all
the
credit
for
myself.
My
English
ally
was
worthy
of
such
an
alliance.
He
knew
the
London
and
West
Coast
line
thoroughly,
and
he
had
the
command
of
a
band
of
workers
who
were
trustworthy
and
intelligent.
The
idea
was
his,
and
my
own
judgement
was
only
required
in
the
details.
We
bought
over
several
officials,
amongst
whom
the
most
important
was
James
McPherson,
whom
we
had
ascertained
to
be
the
guard
most
likely
to
be
employed
upon
a
special
train.
Smith,
the
stoker,
was
also
in
our
employ.
John
Slater,
the
engine
driver,
had
been
approached,
but
had
been
found
to
be
obstinate
and
dangerous,
so
we
desisted.
We
had
no
certainty
that
Monsieur
Caratal
would
take
a
special,
but
we
thought
it
very
probable,
for
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
to
him
that
he
should
reach
Paris
without
delay.
It
was
for
this
contingency,
therefore,
that
we
made
special
preparations
preparations
which
were
complete
down
to
the
last
detail
long
before
his
steamer
had
sighted
the
shores
of
England.
