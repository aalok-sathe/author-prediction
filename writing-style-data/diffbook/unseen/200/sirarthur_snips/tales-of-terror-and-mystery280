know
his
cards

It
was
as
much
a
part
of
a
sharper's
outfit
as
the
elastic
clip
upon
Sparrow
MacCoy's
arm.
Taking
that,
in
connection
with
the
recent
frauds
at
the
hotels,
the
police
might

got
hold
of

in
London,
and
I

the
heart
to
tell
her
the
truth.
He

but,
then,
he
never
did
write
at
any
time,

difference.
His
name
was
the
last
upon
her
lips.
"There's
just
one
other
thing
that
