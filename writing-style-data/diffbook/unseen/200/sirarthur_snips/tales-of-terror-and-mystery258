unlikely
the
coincidence
that
conspirators
should
stray
exactly
into
the
very
compartment
in
which
a
spy
was
already
concealed!
Besides,
this
explanation
ignored
the
man
in
the
smoking
carriage,
and
gave
no
reason
at
all
for
his
simultaneous
disappearance.
The
police
had
little
difficulty
in
showing
that
such
a
theory
would
not
cover
the
facts,
but
they
were
unprepared
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
advance
any
alternative
explanation.
There
was
a
letter
in
the
Daily
Gazette,
over
the
signature
of
a
well
known
criminal
investigator,
which
gave
rise
to
considerable
discussion
at
the
time.
He
had
formed
a
hypothesis
which
had
at
least
ingenuity
to
recommend
it,
and
I
cannot
do
better
than
append
it
in
his
own
words.
"Whatever
may
be
the
truth,"
said
he,
"it
must
depend
upon
some
bizarre
and
rare
combination
of
events,
so
we
need
have
no
hesitation
in
postulating
such
events
in
our
explanation.
In
the
absence
of
data
we
must
abandon
the
analytic
or
scientific
method
of
investigation,
and
must
approach
it
in
the
synthetic
fashion.
In
a
word,
instead
of
taking
known
events
and
deducing
from
them
what
has
occurred,
we
must
build
up
a
fanciful
explanation
if
it
will
