century
'black
jacks'
as
they
were
called
which
were
of
the

colour
and
hardness
as
this
filler."
"I
dare
say
the
date
would
be
about
the
same,"
said
Dacre,
"and,
no
doubt,
also,
it
was
used
for
filling
a
vessel
with
liquid.
If
my
suspicions
are
correct,
however,
it
was
a
queer
vintner
who
used
it,
and
a

singular
cask
which
was
filled.
Do

As

lacerated.
It
must
have
taken
some
strength
to
leave
these
marks
on
such
tough
material,
whatever
the
instrument
may
have
been.
But
what
