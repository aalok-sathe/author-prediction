two
gentlemen
down
Regent
Street."
The
man
looked
surprised
and
a
little
embarrassed.
"Why,
there's
no
good
my
telling
you
things,
for
you
seem
to
know
as
much
as
I
do
already,"
said
he.
"The
truth
is
that
the
gentleman
told
me
that
he
was
a
detective
and
that

mentioned?"
"His
name,"
said
the
cabman,
"was

I
seen
my
friend
more

he
sat
in
silent

Then
he
burst
into
a
