was
as
curved
and
cruel
as
the
beak
of
a
vulture.
"The
whole
aspect
of
this
monster
was
formidable
and
threatening,
and
it
kept
changing
its
colour
from
a
very
light
mauve
to
a
dark,
angry
purple
so
thick
that
it
cast
a
shadow
as
it
drifted
between
my
monoplane
and
the
sun.
On
the
upper
curve
of
its
huge
body
there
were
three
great
projections
which
I
can
only
describe
as
enormous
bubbles,
and
I
was
convinced
as
I
looked
at
them
that
they
were
charged
with
some
extremely
light
gas
which
served
to
buoy
up
the
misshapen
and
semi
solid
mass
in
the
rarefied
air.
The
creature
moved
swiftly
along,
keeping
pace
easily
with
the
monoplane,
and
for
twenty
miles
or
more
it
formed
my
horrible
escort,
hovering
over
me
like
a
bird
of
prey
which
is
waiting
to
pounce.
Its
method
of
progression
done
so
swiftly
that
it
was
not
easy
to
follow
was
to
throw
out
a
long,
glutinous
streamer
in
front
of
it,
which
in
turn
seemed
to
draw
forward
the
rest
of
the
writhing
body.
So
elastic
and
gelatinous
was
it
that
never
for
two
successive
minutes
was
it
the
same
shape,
and
yet
