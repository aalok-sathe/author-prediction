sequence
of
events
as
I
reconstruct
them
would
be
after
this
fashion.
This
young
man
with
the
abnormal
number
of
watches
was
alone
in
the
carriage
of
the
slow
train.
His
ticket,
with
his
papers
and
gloves
and
other
things,
was,
we
will
suppose,
on
the
seat
beside
him.
He
was
probably
an
American,
and
also
probably
a
man
of
weak
intellect.
The
excessive
wearing
of
jewellery
is
an
early
symptom
in
some
forms
of
mania.
"As
he
sat
watching
the
carriages
of
the
express
which
were
(on
account
of
the
state
of
the
line)
going
at
the
same
pace
as
himself,
he
suddenly
saw
some
people
in
it
whom
he
knew.
We
will
suppose
for
the
sake
of
our
theory
that
these
people
were
a
woman
whom
he
loved
and
a
man
whom
he
hated
and
who
in
return
hated
him.
The
young
man
was
excitable
and
impulsive.
He
opened
the
door
of
his
carriage,
stepped
from
the
footboard
of
the
local
train
to
the
footboard
of
the
express,
opened
the
other
door,
and
made
his
way
into
the
presence
of
these
two
people.
The
feat
(on
the
supposition
that
the
trains
were
going
at
the
same
pace)
is
