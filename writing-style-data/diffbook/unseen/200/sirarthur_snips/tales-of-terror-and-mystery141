my

or
to
cash
any
further
post
obits
upon
an
unentailed
property.
Ruin
lay
right
across
my
path,
and
every
day
I
saw
it
clearer,
nearer,
and
more
absolutely
unavoidable.
What
made
me
feel
my
own
poverty
the
more
was
that,
apart
from
the
great
wealth
of
Lord
Southerton,
all
my
other
relations
were
fairly
well
to
do.
The
nearest
of
these
was
Everard
King,
my
father's
nephew
and
my
own
first
cousin,
who
had
spent
an
adventurous
life
in
Brazil,
and
had
now
returned
to
this
country
to
settle
down
on
his
fortune.
We
never
knew
how
he
made
his
money,
but
he
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
it,
for
he
bought
the
estate
of
Greylands,
near
Clipton
on
the
Marsh,
in
Suffolk.
For
the
first
year
of
his
residence
in
England
he
took
no
more
notice
of
me
than
my
miserly
uncle;
but
at
last
one
summer
morning,
to
my
very
great
relief
and
joy,
I
received
a
letter
asking
me
to
come
down
that
very
day
and
spend
a
short
visit
at
Greylands
Court.
I
was
expecting
a
rather
long
visit
to
Bankruptcy
Court
at
the
time,
and
this
interruption
seemed
almost
providential.
If
I
could
