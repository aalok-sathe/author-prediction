could
see
that
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
reply.
We
walked
on
each
side
of
the
old
Professor,
the
astonished
commissionaire
bringing
up
the
rear.
When
we
reached
the
violated
case,
Mortimer
stopped
and
examined
the
breastplate.
Already
one
of
the
stones
of
the
lower
row
had
had
its
setting
turned
back
in
the
same
manner
as
the
others.
My

to
understand
matters
as
best
he
could.
The
Professor
sat
down
in
Mortimer's
arm
chair,
and
turned
so
ghastly
a
colour
that
for
the
instant
all
our
resentment
was
changed
to
concern.
A
stiff
glass
of
brandy
brought
the
life
back
to
him
once
more.
"There,
I
am
better
now!"
said
he.
"These
last
few
days
have
been
