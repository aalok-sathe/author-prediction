the
setting
of
these
four
jewels
had
been
tampered
with.
There
remained
one
course
for
Mortimer
to
take,
and
he
took
it.
Leaving
the
police
to
continue
their
fruitless
researches,
he
asked
me
to
accompany
him
that
afternoon
in
a
visit
to
Professor
Andreas.
He
took
with
him
the
two
letters,
and
it
was
his
intention
to
openly
tax
his
predecessor

I
have
mentioned
incidentally
that
the
Professor's
daughter
was
a
very
beautiful
girl.
She
was
a
blonde,
tall
and
graceful,
with
a
skin
of
that
delicate
tint
which
the
French
call
"mat,"
the
colour
of
old
ivory,
or
of
the
lighter
petals
of
the
sulphur
rose.
I
was
shocked,
however,
as
she
entered
the
room
to
see
how
much
she
had
changed
in
the
last
fortnight.
