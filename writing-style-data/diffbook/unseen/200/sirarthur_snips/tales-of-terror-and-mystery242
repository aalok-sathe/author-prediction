the
butler
and
two
footmen,
who
had
been
alarmed
by
the
cries,
rushed
into
the
room.
With
their
aid
we
had
no
further
difficulty
in
securing
our
prisoner,
who
lay
foaming
and
glaring
upon
the
ground.
One
glance
at
his
face
was
enough
to
prove
that
he
was
a
dangerous
maniac,
while
the
short,
heavy
hammer
which
lay
beside
the
bed
showed
how
murderous
had
been
his
intentions.
"Do
not
use
any
violence!"
said
Lord
Linchmere,
as
we
raised
the
struggling
man
to
his
feet.
"He
will
have
a
period
of
stupor
after
this
excitement.
I
believe
that
it
is
coming
on
already."
As
he
spoke
the
convulsions
became
less
violent,
and
the
madman's
head
fell
forward
upon
his
breast,
as
if
he
were
overcome
by
sleep.
We
led
him
down
the
passage
and
stretched
him
upon
his
own
bed,
where
he
lay
unconscious,
breathing
heavily.
"Two
of
you
will
watch
him,"
said
Lord
Linchmere.
"And
now,
Dr.
Hamilton,
if
you
will
return
with
me
to
my
room,
I
will
give
you
the
explanation
which
my
horror
of
scandal
has
perhaps
caused
me
to
delay
too
long.
Come
what
may,
you
will
never
have
cause
to
regret
your
share
in
