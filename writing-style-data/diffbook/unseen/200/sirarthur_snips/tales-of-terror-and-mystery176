had
occurred,
when,
drawn
by
the
death
cries
of
their
master,
they
found
me
behind
the
bars,
and
his
remains
or
what
they
afterwards
discovered
to
be
his
remains
in
the
clutch
of
the
creature
which
he
had
reared.
They
stalled
him
off
with
hot
irons,
and
afterwards
shot
him
through
the
loophole
of
the
door
before
they
could
finally
extricate
me.
I
was
carried
to
my
bedroom,
and
there,
under
the
roof
of
my
would
be
murderer,
I
remained
between
life
and
death
for
several
weeks.
They
had
sent
for
a
surgeon
from
Clipton
and
a
nurse
from
London,
and
in
a
month
I
was
able
to
be
carried
to
the
station,
and
so
conveyed
back
once
more
to
Grosvenor
Mansions.
I
have
one
remembrance
of
that
illness,
which
might
have
been
part
of
the
ever
changing
panorama
conjured
up
by
a
delirious
brain
were
it
not
so
definitely
fixed
in
my
memory.
One
night,
when
the
nurse
was
absent,
the
door
of
my
chamber
opened,
and
a
tall
woman
in
blackest
mourning
slipped
into
the
room.
She
came
across
to
me,
and
as
she
bent
her
sallow
face
I
saw
by
the
faint
gleam
of
the
night
light
