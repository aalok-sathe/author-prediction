of
the
gentleman
whom
we
still
confidently
assert
to
be
deceased.
I
need
not
point
out
that
the
theory
so
unexpectedly
sprung
upon
us
may
prove
to
be
a
very
obvious
device
adopted
by
the
friends
of
the
prisoner
in
order
to
divert
this
inquiry.
I
would
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
young
lady
must,
according
to
her
own
account,
have
possessed
this
letter
during
the
proceedings
at
the
inquest
and
at
the
police
court.
She
desires
us
to
believe
that
she
permitted
these
to
proceed,
although
she
held
in
her
pocket
evidence
which
would
at
any
moment
have
brought
them
to
an
end.
Mr.
Humphrey.
Can
you
explain
this,
Miss
Morton?
Miss
Morton:
Dr.
Lana
desired
his
secret
to
be
preserved.
Mr.
Porlock
Carr:
Then
why
have
you
made
this
public?
Miss
Morton:
To
save
my
brother.
A
murmur
of
sympathy
broke
out
in
court,
which
was
instantly
suppressed
by
the
Judge.
The
Judge:
Admitting
this
line
of
defence,
it
lies
with
you,
Mr.
Humphrey,
to
throw
a
light
upon
who
this
man
is
whose
body
has
been
recognized
by
so
many
friends
and
patients
of
Dr.
Lana
as
being
that
of
the
doctor
himself.
A
Juryman:
