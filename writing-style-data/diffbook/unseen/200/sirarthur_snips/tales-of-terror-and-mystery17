said
to
be
a
fearless
race.
With
so
many
things
to
think
of
there
is
no
time
to
trouble
about
oneself.
About
this
time
I
noted
how
unreliable
is
the
compass
when
above
a
certain
height
from
earth.
At
fifteen
thousand
feet
mine
was
pointing
east
and
a
point
south.
The
sun
and
the
wind
gave
me
my
true
bearings.
"I
had
hoped
to
reach
an
eternal
stillness
in
these

altitudes,
but
with

was
above
little
Wiltshire
that
my
air

and
all
my
labour
might
be
lost
if
I
struck
the
outer
layers
at
some
farther
point.
"When
I
