fuller
knowledge
of
the
life
of
the
man
whom
I
served.
The
immediate
cause
of
this
was
no
less
than
the
falling
of
Master
Percy,
the
youngest
of
my
pupils,
into
the
mill
race,
with
imminent
danger
both
to
his
life
and
to
mine,
since
I
had
to
risk
myself
in
order
to
save
him.
Dripping
and
exhausted
for
I
was
far
more
spent
than
the
child
I
was
making
for
my
room
when
Sir
John,
who
had
heard
the
hubbub,
opened
the
door
of
his
little
study
and
asked
me
what
was
the
matter.
I
told
him
of
the
accident,
but
assured
him
that
his
child
was
in
no
danger,
while
he
listened
with
a
rugged,
immobile
face,
which
expressed
in
its
intense
eyes
and
tightened
lips
all
the
emotion
which
he
tried
to
conceal.
"One
moment!
Step
in
here!
Let
me
have
the
details!"
said
he,
turning
back
through
the
open
door.
And
so
I
found
myself
within
that
little
sanctum,
inside
which,
as
I
afterwards
learned,
no
other
foot
had
for
three
years
been
set
save
that
of
the
old
servant
who
cleaned
it
out.
It
was
a
round
room,
conforming
to
the
shape
of
the
tower
