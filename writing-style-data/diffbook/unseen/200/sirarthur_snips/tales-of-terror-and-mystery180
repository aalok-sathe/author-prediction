how
he
was
getting
on.
That
would
be
about
the
time
when
you
were
down
there.
Was
it
not
strange
that
he
should
wish
to
be
so
well
informed,
since
he
knew
that
he
was
not
the
direct
heir?"
"Very
strange,"
said
I.
"And
now,
Summers,
if
you
will
bring
me
my
bills
and
a
new
cheque
book,
we
will
begin
to
get
things
into
order."
Tales
of
Mystery
The
Lost
Special
The
confession
of
Herbert
de
Lernac,
now
lying
under
sentence
of
death
at
Marseilles,
has
thrown
a
light
upon
one
of
the
most
inexplicable
crimes
of
the
century
an
incident
which
is,
I
believe,
absolutely
unprecedented
in
the
criminal
annals
of
any
country:
Although
there
is
a
reluctance
to
discuss
the
matter
in
official
circles,
and
little
information
has
been
given
to
the
Press,
there
are
still
indications
that
the
statement
of
this
arch
criminal
is
corroborated
by
the
facts,
and
that
we
have
at
last
found
a
solution
for
a
most
astounding
business.
As
the
matter
is
eight
years
old,
and
as
its
importance
was
somewhat
obscured
by
a
political
crisis
which
was
engaging
the
public
attention
at
the
time,
it
may
be
as
well
to
state
