black,
cruel
days
of
the
world's
history?
I
sank
my
throbbing
head
upon
my
shaking
hands.
And
then,
suddenly,
my
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
in
my
bosom,
and
I
could
not
even
scream,
so
great
was
my
terror.
Something
was
advancing
toward
me
through
the
darkness
of
the
room.
It
is
a
horror
coming
upon
a
horror
which
breaks
a
man's
spirit.
I
could
not
reason,
I
could
not
pray;
I
could
only
sit
like
a
frozen
image,
and
glare
at
the
dark
figure
which
was
coming
down
the
great
room.
And
then
it
moved
out
into
the
white
lane
of
moonlight,
and
I
breathed
once
more.
It
was
Dacre,
and
his
face
showed
that
he
was
as
frightened
as
myself.
"Was
that
you?
For
God's
sake
what's
the
matter?"
he
asked
in
a
husky
voice.
"Oh,
Dacre,
I
am
glad
to
see
you!
I
have
been
down
into
hell.
It
was
dreadful."
"Then
it
was
you
who
screamed?"
"I
dare
say
it
was."
"It
rang
through
the
house.
The
servants
are
all
terrified."
He
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
lamp.
"I
think
we
may
get
the
fire
to
burn
up
again,"
he
added,
throwing
some
logs
upon
