"Yes,
I
qualified
in
my
younger
days,
when
there
were
several
lives
between
me
and
the
peerage.
I
have
not
had
occasion
to
practise,
but
I
have
found
it
a
useful
education,
all
the
same.
I
never
regretted
the
years
which
I
devoted
to
medical
study.

A

thin
figure,
curiously
angular
and
bony,
had
emerged
through

gap
in
the
hedge
of
laurels.
In
his
hand
he
held
a
spud,
and
he
wore
gauntleted
gardener's
gloves.
A
broad
