everything
which
concerned
the
old
life
and
history
of
the
city.
He
yearned
to
see
this
new
underworld
which
his
companion
had
discovered.
"Look
here,
Burger,"
said
he,
earnestly,
"I
assure
you
that
you
can
trust
me
most
implicitly
in
the
matter.
Nothing
would
induce
me
to
put
pen
to
paper
about
anything
which
I
see
until
I
have
your
express
permission.
I
quite
understand
your
feeling
and
I
think
it
is
most
natural,
but
you
have
really
nothing
whatever
to
fear
from
me.
On
the
other
hand,
if
you
don't
tell
me
I
shall
make
a
systematic
search,
and
I
shall
most
certainly
discover
it.
In
that
case,
of
course,
I
should
make
what
use
I
liked
of
it,
since
I
should
be
under
no
obligation
to
you."
Burger
smiled
thoughtfully
over
his
cigar.
"I
have
noticed,
friend
Kennedy,"
said
he,
"that
when
I
want
information
over
any
point
you
are
not
always
so
ready
to
supply
it."
"When
did
you
ever
ask
me
anything
that
I
did
not
tell
you?
You
remember,
for
example,
my
giving
you
the
material
for
your
paper
about
the
temple
of
the
Vestals."
"Ah,
well,
that
was
not
a
matter
of
much
importance.
