leaning
eagerly
forward
across
his
desk,
and
there
was
an
expression
of
something
like
anxiety
in
his
eyes.
"I
am
afraid
that
you
do
not
know
about
beetles,"
he
cried.
"On
the
contrary,
sir,
it
is
the
one
scientific
subject
about
which
I
feel
that
I
really
do
know
something."
"I
am
overjoyed

hear
it.
Please
talk

His
eyes

with

London
for
my
purpose.
I

but

difficulty
is
to
lay
one's
hands
upon
him.
I
have
been
extraordinarily
