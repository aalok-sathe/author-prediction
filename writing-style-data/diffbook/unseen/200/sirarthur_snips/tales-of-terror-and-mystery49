his
left
arm,
he
bound
the
woman's
hands
together.
She
held
them
meekly
toward
him
as
he
did
so.
Then
he
took
her
arm
with
a
rough
grip
and
led
her
toward
the
wooden
horse,
which
was
little
higher
than
her
waist.
On
to
this
she
was
lifted
and
laid,
with
her
back
upon
it,
and
her
face
to
the
ceiling,
while
the
priest,
quivering
with
horror,
had
rushed
out
of
the
room.
The
woman's
lips
were
moving
rapidly,
and
though
I
could
hear
nothing
I
knew
that
she
was
praying.
Her
feet
hung
down
on
either
side
of
the
horse,
and
I
saw
that
the
rough
varlets
in
attendance
had
fastened
cords
to
her
ankles
and
secured
the
other
ends
to
iron
rings
in
the
stone
floor.
My
heart
sank
within
me
as
I
saw
these
ominous
preparations,
and
yet
I
was
held
by
the
fascination
of
horror,
and
I
could
not
take
my
eyes
from
the
strange
spectacle.
A
man
had
entered
the
room
with
a
bucket
of
water
in
either
hand.
Another
followed
with
a
third
bucket.
They
were
laid
beside
the
wooden
horse.
The
second
man
had
a
wooden
dipper
a
bowl
with
a
straight
handle
