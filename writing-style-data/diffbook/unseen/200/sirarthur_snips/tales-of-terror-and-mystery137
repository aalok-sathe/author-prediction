according
to
these
gentlemen,
caused
the
doctor
to
wander
down
the
tunnel,
and
a
fall
among
the
rocks
was
sufficient
to
account
for
his
injuries.
On
the
other
hand,
a
legend
of
a
strange
creature
in
the
Gap
has
existed
for
some
months
back,
and
the
farmers
look
upon
Dr.
Hardcastle's
narrative
and
his
personal
injuries
as
a
final
corroboration.
So
the
matter
stands,
and
so
the
matter
will
continue
to
stand,
for
no
definite
solution
seems
to
us
to
be
now
possible.
It

which
could
cover

Perhaps
before
the
Courier
published
these
words
they
would
have
been
wise
to
send
their

to
me.
I
have
thought
the
matter
out,
as
no
one
else
has
occasion
to
do,
and
it
is
possible
that
I
might
have
removed
some
of
the
more
obvious
difficulties
of
the
narrative
and
brought
it
one
degree
nearer
to
scientific
acceptance.
Let
me
then
write
down
the
only
explanation
which
seems
to
me
to
elucidate
what
I
know
to
my
cost
to
have
been
a
series
of
facts.
My
theory
may
seem
to
be
wildly
improbable,
but
at

no
one
can
venture
