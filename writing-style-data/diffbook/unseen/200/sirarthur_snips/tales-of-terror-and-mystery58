stove
which
threw
out
a
zone
of
stuffiness
rather
than
of
warmth.
Outside
under
the
bright
winter
stars
lay
the
modern
Rome,
the
long,
double
chain
of
the
electric
lamps,
the
brilliantly
lighted
cafes,
the
rushing
carriages,
and
the
dense
throng
upon
the
footpaths.
But
inside,
in
the
sumptuous
chamber
of
the
rich
young
English
archaeologist,
there
was
only
old
Rome
to
be
seen.
Cracked
and
timeworn
friezes
hung
upon
the
walls,
grey
old
busts
of
senators
and
soldiers
with
their
fighting
heads
and
their
hard,
cruel
faces
peered
out
from
the
corners.
On
the
centre
table,
amidst
a
litter
of
inscriptions,
fragments,
and
ornaments,
there
stood
the
famous
reconstruction
by
Kennedy
of
the
Baths
of
Caracalla,
which
excited
such
interest
and
admiration
when
it
was
exhibited
in
Berlin.
Amphorae
hung
from
the
ceiling,
and
a
litter
of
curiosities
strewed
the
rich
red
Turkey
carpet.
And
of
them
all
there
was
not
one
which
was
not
of
the
most
unimpeachable
authenticity,
and
of
the
utmost
rarity
and
value;
for
Kennedy,
though
little
more
than
thirty,
had
a
European
reputation
in
this
particular
branch
of
research,
and
was,
moreover,
provided
with
that
long
purse
which
either
proves
to
be
a
fatal
