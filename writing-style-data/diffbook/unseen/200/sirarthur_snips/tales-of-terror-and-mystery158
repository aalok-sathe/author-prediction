perfunctory
and
pointless,
that
I
was
sure
he
had
not
in
the
least
followed
my
remarks.
Every
now
and
then
he
roused
himself
and
put
on
some
show
of
interest,
asking
me
to
repeat
or
to
explain
more
fully,
but
it
was
always
to
sink
once
more
into
the
same
brown
study.
At
last
he
rose
and
threw
the
end
of
his
cigar
into
the
grate.
"I'll
tell
you
what,
my
boy,"
said
he.
"I
never
had
a
head
for
figures,
so
you
will
excuse
me.
You
must
jot
it
all
down
upon
paper,
and
let
me
have
a
note
of
the
amount.
I'll
understand
it
when
I
see
it
in
black
and
white."
The
proposal
was
encouraging.
I
promised
to
do
so.
"And
now
it's
time
we
were
in
bed.
By
Jove,
there's
one
o'clock
striking
in
the
hall."
The
tingling
of
the
chiming
clock
broke
through
the
deep
roar
of
the
gale.
The
wind
was
sweeping
past
with
the
rush
of
a
great
river.
"I
must
see
my
cat
before
I
go
to
bed,"
said
my
host.
"A
high
wind
excites
him.
Will
you
come?"
"Certainly,"
said
I.
"Then
tread
softly
and
don't
speak,
for
everyone
is
asleep."
