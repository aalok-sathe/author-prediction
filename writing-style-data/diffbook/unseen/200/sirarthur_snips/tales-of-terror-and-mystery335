a
dark
patch
over
his
eye,
but
our
features
were
absolutely
the
same.
Then
he
smiled
in
a
sardonic
way
which
had
been
a
trick
of
his
from
his
boyhood,
and
I
knew
that
he
was
the
same
brother
who
had
driven
me
from
my
native
land,
and
brought
disgrace
upon
what
had
been
an
honourable
name.
I
went
to
the
door
and
I
admitted
him.
That
would
be
about
ten
o'clock
that
night.
"When
he
came
into
the
glare
of
the
lamp,
I
saw
at
once
that
he
had
fallen
upon
very
evil
days.
He
had
walked
from
Liverpool,
and
he
was
tired
and
ill.
I
was
quite
shocked
by
the
expression
upon
his
face.
My
medical
knowledge
told
me
that
there
was
some
serious
internal
malady.
He
had
been
drinking
also,
and
his
face
was
bruised
as
the
result
of
a
scuffle
which
he
had
had
with
some
sailors.
It
was
to
cover
his
injured
eye
that
he
wore
this
patch,
which
he
removed
when
he
entered
the
room.
He
was
himself
dressed
in
a
pea
jacket
and
flannel
shirt,
and
his
feet
were
bursting
through
his
boots.
But
his
poverty
had
only
made
him
more
savagely
vindictive
