the
train
is
going,"
said
he.
"First
class,"
the
man
answered.
The
guard
turned
the
handle
of
the
nearest
door.
In
the
carriage
which
he
had
opened,
there
sat
a
small
man
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth.
His
appearance
seems
to
have
impressed
itself
upon
the
guard's
memory,
for
he
was
prepared,
afterwards,
to
describe
or
to
identify
him.
He
was
a
man
of
thirty
four
or
thirty
five
years
of
age,
dressed
in
some
grey
material,
sharp
nosed,
alert,
with
a
ruddy,
weather
beaten
face,
and
a
small,
closely
cropped,
black
beard.
He
glanced
up
as
the
door
was
opened.
The
tall
man
paused
with
his
foot
upon
the
step.
"This
is
a
smoking
compartment.
The
lady
dislikes
smoke,"
said
he,
looking
round
at
the
guard.
"All
right!
Here
you
are,
sir!"
said
John
Palmer.
He
slammed
the
door
of
the
smoking
carriage,
opened
that
of
the
next
one,
which
was
empty,
and
thrust
the
two
travellers
in.
At
the
same
moment
he
sounded
his
whistle
and
the
wheels
of
the
train
began
to
move.
The
man
with
the
cigar
was
at
the
window
of
his
carriage,
and
said
something
to
the
guard
as
he
rolled
past
him,
