The
Horror
of
the
Heights
The
idea
that
the
extraordinary
narrative
which
has
been
called
the
Joyce
Armstrong
Fragment
is
an
elaborate
practical
joke
evolved
by
some
unknown
person,
cursed
by
a
perverted
and
sinister
sense
of
humour,
has
now
been
abandoned
by
all
who
have
examined
the
matter.
The
most
macabre
and
imaginative
of
plotters
would
hesitate
before
linking
his
morbid
fancies
with
the
unquestioned
and
tragic
facts
which
reinforce
the
statement.
Though
the
assertions
contained
in
it
are
amazing
and
even
monstrous,
it
is
none
the
less
forcing
itself
upon
the
general
intelligence
that
they
are
true,
and
that
we
must
readjust
our
ideas
to
the
new
situation.
This
world
of
ours
appears
to
be
separated
by
a
slight
and
precarious
margin
of
safety
from
a
most
singular
and
unexpected
danger.
I
will
endeavour
in
this
narrative,
which
reproduces
the
original
document
in
its
necessarily
somewhat
fragmentary
form,
to
lay
before
the
reader
the
whole
of
the
facts
up
to
date,
prefacing
my
statement
by
saying
that,
if
there
be
any
who
doubt
the
narrative
of
Joyce
Armstrong,
there
can
be
no
question
at
all
as
to
the
facts
concerning
Lieutenant
Myrtle,
R.
N.,
and
Mr.
Hay
Connor,
