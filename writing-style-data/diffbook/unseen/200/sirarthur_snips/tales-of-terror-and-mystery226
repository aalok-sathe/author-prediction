You
may
imagine
that
I
had
plenty
to
think
of
from
the
time
that
I
left
Brook
Street
until
I
set
out
to
meet
Lord
Linchmere
at
Paddington.
The
whole
fantastic
business
kept
arranging
and
rearranging
itself
in
kaleidoscopic
forms
inside

it
had
been
in
the
morning.
He
wore
a
long,
thick
travelling
ulster,
and
I
observed
that
he
carried
a
heavy
blackthorn
cudgel
in
his
hand.
"I
have
the
tickets,"
said
he,
leading
the
way
up
the
platform.
"This
is
