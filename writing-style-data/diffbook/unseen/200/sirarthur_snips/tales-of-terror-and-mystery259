be
consistent
with
known
events.
We
can
then
test
this
explanation
by
any
fresh
facts
which
may
arise.
If
they
all
fit
into
their
places,
the
probability
is
that
we
are
upon
the
right
track,
and
with
each
fresh
fact
this
probability
increases
in
a
geometrical
progression
until
the
evidence
becomes
final
and
convincing.
"Now,
there
is
one
most
remarkable
and
suggestive
fact
which
has
not
met
with
the
attention
which
it
deserves.
There
is
a
local
train
running
through
Harrow
and
King's
Langley,
which
is
timed
in
such
a
way
that
the
express
must
have
overtaken
it
at
or
about
the
period
when
it
eased
down
its
speed
to
eight
miles
an
hour
on
account
of
the
repairs
of
the
line.
The
two
trains
would
at
that
time
be
travelling
in
the
same
direction
at
a
similar
rate
of
speed
and
upon
parallel
lines.
It
is
within
every
one's
experience
how,
under
such
circumstances,
the
occupant
of
each
carriage
can
see
very
plainly
the
passengers
in
the
other
carriages
opposite
to
him.
The
lamps
of
the
express
had
been
lit
at
Willesden,
so
that
each
compartment
was
brightly
illuminated,
and
most
visible
to
an
observer
from
outside.
"Now,
the
