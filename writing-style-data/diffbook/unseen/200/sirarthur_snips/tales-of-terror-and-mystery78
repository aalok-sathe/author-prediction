this
common
centre.
"I
want
you
to
follow
me
closely,
my
friend,"
said
Burger.
"Do
not
loiter
to
look
at
anything
upon
the
way,
for
the
place
to
which
I
will
take
you
contains
all
that
you
can
see,
and
more.
It
will
save
time
for
us
to
go
there
direct."
He
led
the
way
down
one
of
the
corridors,
and
the
Englishman
followed
closely
at

Every
now
and
then
the
passage
bifurcated,
but
Burger
was
evidently
following
some
secret
marks
of

for
he
neither
stopped

Everywhere

the
walls,

The
yellow
light
flickered
over
the
shrivelled
features
of
the
mummies,
and
gleamed
upon
rounded
skulls
and
long,
white
armbones
crossed
over
fleshless
chests.
And
everywhere
as
he
passed
Kennedy
looked
with
wistful
eyes
upon
inscriptions,
funeral
vessels,
pictures,
vestments,
utensils,
all
lying
as
pious
hands
had
placed
them
so
many
centuries
ago.
It
was
apparent
to
him,
even
in
those
hurried,
passing
glances,
that
this
was
the
earliest
and
finest
of
the
catacombs,
containing
such
a
storehouse
of
Roman
remains
as
had
never
before
come
at
one
time
