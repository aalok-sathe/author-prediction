and
certainly

The
fact
that
something
closely
resembling
the
organism
of
malaria
was
discovered
in
this
blood,
and
that
Joyce
Armstrong
is
known
to
have
suffered
from
intermittent
fever,
is
a
remarkable
example
of
the
new
weapons
which
modern
science
has
placed
in
the
hands
of
our
detectives.
And
now
a
word
as
to
the
personality
of
the
author
of
this
epoch

statement.
Joyce
Armstrong,
according
to
the
few
friends
who
really
knew
something
of
the
man,
was
a
poet
and
a
dreamer,
as

a
mechanic

man
of
considerable
wealth,
much
of
which
he
had
spent
in
the
pursuit
of
his
aeronautical
hobby.
He
had
four
private
aeroplanes
in
his
hangars
near
Devizes,
and
is
said
to
have
made
no
fewer
than
one

and
seventy
ascents
in
the
course
of
last
year.
He
was
a
retiring
man
with
dark
moods,
in
which
he
would
avoid
the
society
of
his
fellows.
Captain
Dangerfield,
who
knew
him
better
than
anyone,
says
that
there
were
times
when
his
eccentricity
threatened
to
develop
into
something
more
serious.
