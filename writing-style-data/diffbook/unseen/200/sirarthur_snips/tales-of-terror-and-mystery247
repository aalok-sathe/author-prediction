above
question)
has,
however,
thrown
some
new
and
clear
light
upon
the
matter.
Before
laying
it
before
the
public
it
would
be
as
well,
perhaps,
that
I
should
refresh
their
memories
as
to
the
singular
facts
upon
which
this
commentary
is
founded.
These
facts
were
briefly
as
follows:
At
five
o'clock
on
the
evening
of
the
18th
of
March
in
the
year
already
mentioned
a
train
left
Euston
Station
for
Manchester.
It
was
a
rainy,
squally
day,
which
grew
wilder
as
it
progressed,
so
it
was
by
no
means
the
weather
in
which
anyone
would
travel
who
was
not
driven
to
do
so
by
necessity.
The
train,
however,
is
a
favourite
one
among
Manchester
business
men
who
are
returning
from
town,
for
it
does
the
journey
in
four
hours
and
twenty
minutes,
with
only
three
stoppages
upon
the
way.
In
spite
of
the
inclement
evening
it
was,
therefore,
fairly
well
filled
upon
the
occasion
of
which
I
speak.
The
guard
of
the
train
was
a
tried
servant
of
the
company
a
man
who
had
worked
for
twenty
two
years
without
a
blemish
or
complaint.
His
name
was
John
Palmer.
The
station
clock
was
upon
the
stroke
of
five,
and
the
