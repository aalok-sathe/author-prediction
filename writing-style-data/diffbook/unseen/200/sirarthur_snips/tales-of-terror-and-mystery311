the
scene
of
his
success.
Such
was
the
position
of
affairs
when,
upon
the
evening
of
Monday,
June
21st,
there
came
a
fresh
development
which
changed
what
had
been
a
mere
village
scandal
into
a
tragedy
which
arrested
the
attention
of
the
whole
nation.
Some
detail
is
necessary
to
cause
the
facts
of
that
evening
to
present
their
full
significance.
The
sole
occupants
of
the
doctor's
house
were
his
housekeeper,
an
elderly
and
most
respectable
woman,
named
Martha
Woods,
and
a
young
servant
Mary
Pilling.
The
coachman
and
the
surgery
boy
slept
out.
It
was
the
custom
of
the
doctor
to
sit
at
night
in
his
study,
which
was
next
the
surgery
in
the
wing
of
the
house
which
was
farthest
from
the
servants'
quarters.
This
side
of
the
house
had
a
door
of
its
own
for
the
convenience
of
patients,
so
that
it
was
possible
for
the
doctor
to
admit
and
receive
a
visitor
there
without
the
knowledge
of
anyone.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
when
patients
came
late
it
was
quite
usual
for
him
to
let
them
in
and
out
by
the
surgery
entrance,
for
the
maid
and
the
housekeeper
were
in
the
habit
of
retiring
early.
