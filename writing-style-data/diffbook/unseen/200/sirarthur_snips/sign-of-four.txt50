expected,

welcome,
visitors."
Mr.
Thaddeus
Sholto
ceased,
and
sat
twitching
on
his
luxurious
settee.
We
all
remained
silent,
with
our
thoughts
upon
the
new
development
which
the
mysterious
business
had
taken.
Holmes
was
the
first
to
spring
to
his
feet.
"You
have
done
well,
sir,
from
first
to
last,"
said
he.
"It
is
possible
that
we
may

no
part
of
