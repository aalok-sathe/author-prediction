two
things
upon
you
while
we
travel
down."
And
yet
all
that
he
had
to
impress
upon
me
might
have
been
said
in
a
sentence,
for
it
was
that
I
was
to
remember
that
I
was
there
as
a
protection
to
himself,
and
that
I
was
not
on
any
consideration
to
leave
him
for
an
instant.
This
he
repeated
again
and
again
as
our
journey
drew
to
a
close,
with
an
insistence
which
showed
that
his
nerves
were
thoroughly
shaken.
"Yes,"
he
said
at
last,
in
answer
to
my
looks
rather
than
to
my
words,
"I
AM
nervous,
Dr.
Hamilton.
I
have
always
been
a
timid
man,
and
my
timidity
depends
upon
my
frail
physical
health.
But
my
soul
is
firm,
and
I
can
bring
myself
up
to
face
a
danger
which
a
less
nervous
man
might
shrink
from.
What
I
am
doing
now
is
done
from
no
compulsion,
but
entirely
from
a
sense
of
duty,
and
yet
it
is,
beyond
doubt,
a
desperate
risk.
If
things
should
go
wrong,
I
will
have
some
claims
to
the
title
of
martyr."
This
eternal
reading
of
riddles
was
too
much
for
me.
I
felt
that
I
must
put
a
term
to
it.
