that
of
a
pretty
woman.
There
was
the
piquant
difficulty
of
it
also,
for,
as
she
was
the
companion
of
Lady
Emily
Rood,
it
was
almost
impossible
to
see
her
alone.
On
the
top
of
all
the
other
obstacles
which
attracted
me,
I
learned
from
her
own
lips
very

"What

"Oh,
no,
it
took
about
three
months
of
sapping
and
mining.
But
at
last
I
won
her
over.
She
understood
that
my
judicial
separation
from
my
wife
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
do
the
right
thing
