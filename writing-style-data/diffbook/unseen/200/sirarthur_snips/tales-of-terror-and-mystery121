too
much
horrified
to
move.
I
thought
of
the
sound
which
I
had
heard
coming
from
the
depths
of
the
cave,
of
Armitage's
fears,
of
the
strange
impression
in
the
mud,
and
now
came
this
final
and
absolute
proof
that
there
was
indeed
some
inconceivable
monster,
something
utterly
unearthly
and
dreadful,
which
lurked
in
the
hollow
of
the
mountain.
Of
its
nature
or
form
I
could
frame
no
conception,
save
that
it
was
both
light
footed
and
gigantic.
The
combat
between
my
reason,
which
told
me
that
such
things
could
not
be,
and
my
senses,
which
told
me
that
they
were,
raged
within
me
as
I
lay.
Finally,
I
was
almost
ready
to
persuade
myself
that
this
experience
had
been
part
of
some
evil
dream,
and
that
my
abnormal
condition
might
have
conjured
up
an
hallucination.
But
there
remained
one
final
experience
which
removed
the
last
possibility
of
doubt
from
my
mind.
I
had
taken
my
matches
from
my
armpit
and
felt
them.
They
seemed
perfectly
hard
and
dry.
Stooping
down
into
a
crevice
of
the
rocks,
I
tried
one
of
them.
To
my
delight
it
took
fire
at
once.
I
lit
the
candle,
and,
with
a
terrified
backward
glance
