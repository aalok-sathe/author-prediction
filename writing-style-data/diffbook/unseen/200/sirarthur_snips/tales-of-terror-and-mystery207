finishing
touches
were
needed.
The
side
line
which
we
had
chosen
had
once
joined
the
main
line,
but
it
had
been
disconnected.
We
had
only
to
replace
a
few
rails
to
connect
it
once
more.
These
rails
had
been
laid
down
as
far
as
could
be
done
without
danger
of
attracting
attention,
and
now
it
was
merely
a
case
of
completing
a
juncture
with
the
line,
and
arranging
the
points
as
they
had
been
before.
The
sleepers
had
never
been
removed,
and
the
rails,
fish
plates
and
rivets
were
all
ready,
for
we
had
taken
them
from
a
siding
on
the
abandoned
portion
of
the
line.
With
my
small
but
competent
band
of
workers,
we
had
everything
ready
long
before
the
special
arrived.
When
it
did
arrive,
it
ran
off
upon
the
small
side
line
so
easily
that
the
jolting
of
the
points
appears
to
have
been
entirely
unnoticed
by
the
two
travellers.
"Our
plan
had
been
that
Smith,
the
stoker,
should
chloroform
John
Slater,
the
driver,
so
that
he
should
vanish
with
the
others.
In
this
respect,
and
in
this
respect
only,
our
plans
miscarried
I
except
the
criminal
folly
of
McPherson
in
writing
home
to
his
wife.
