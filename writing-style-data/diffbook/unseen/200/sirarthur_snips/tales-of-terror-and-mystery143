away
from
my
driver's
panegyric
by
the
appearance
of
a
very
beautiful
bird
which
settled
on
a
telegraph
post
beside
the
road.
At
first
I
thought
that
it
was
a
jay,
but
it
was
larger,
with
a
brighter
plumage.
The
driver
accounted
for
its
presence
at
once
by
saying
that
it
belonged
to
the
very
man
whom
we
were
about
to
visit.
It
seems
that
the
acclimatization
of
foreign
creatures
was
one
of
his
hobbies,
and
that
he
had
brought
with
him
from
Brazil
a
number
of
birds
and
beasts
which
he
was
endeavouring
to
rear
in
England.
When
once
we
had
passed
the
gates
of
Greylands
Park
we
had
ample
evidence
of
this
taste
of
his.
Some
small
spotted
deer,
a
curious
wild
pig
known,
I
believe,
as
a
peccary,
a
gorgeously
feathered
oriole,
some
sort
of
armadillo,
and
a
singular
lumbering
in
toed
beast
like
a
very
fat
badger,
were
among
the
creatures
which
I
observed
as
we
drove
along
the
winding
avenue.
Mr.
Everard
King,
my
unknown
cousin,
was
standing
in
person
upon
the
steps
of
his
house,
for
he
had
seen
us
in
the
distance,
and
guessed
that
it
was
I.
His
appearance
was
very
homely
