that
if
sheep
wander
into
such
rocky
places
they
are
likely
to
injure
themselves,
and
yet
somehow
that
splash
of
crimson
gave
me
a
sudden
shock,
and
for
a
moment
I
found
myself
shrinking
back
in
horror
from
the
old
Roman
arch.
A
fetid
breath

my
nerves
grown
more
steady.
Tomorrow
I
trust
that
I
shall
have
gone
more
deeply
into
this
matter.

Let
me
try
and
set
down
as
accurately
as
I
can
my
extraordinary
experience
of
yesterday.
I
started
in
the
afternoon,
and
made
my
way
to
the
Blue

Gap.
I
confess
that
my
misgivings
