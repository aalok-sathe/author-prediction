has
sunk
with
the
fall
in
land,
but
which
still
remains
at
that
ideal
sum
which
is
large
enough
to
encourage
an
investigator,
but
not
so
large
as
to
enervate
him.
There
was
only
one
reason
which
made
Ward
Mortimer's
position
a
little
difficult
at
the
Belmore
Street
Museum,
and
that
was
the
extreme
eminence
of
the
man
whom
he
had
to
succeed.
Professor
Andreas
was
a
profound
scholar
and
a
man
of
European
reputation.
His
lectures
were
frequented
by
students
from
every
part
of
the
world,
and
his
admirable
management
of
the
collection
intrusted
to
his
care
was
a
commonplace
in
all
learned
societies.
There
was,
therefore,
considerable
surprise
when,
at
the
age
of
fifty
five,
he
suddenly
resigned
his
position
and
retired
from
those
duties
which
had
been
both
his
livelihood
and
his
pleasure.
He
and
his
daughter
left
the
comfortable
suite
of
rooms
which
had
formed
his
official
residence
in
connection
with
the
museum,
and
my
friend,
Mortimer,
who
was
a
bachelor,
took
up
his
quarters
there.
On
hearing
of
Mortimer's
appointment
Professor
Andreas
had
written
him
a
very
kindly
and
flattering
congratulatory
letter.
I
was
actually
present
at
their
first
meeting,
and
I
went
with
Mortimer
