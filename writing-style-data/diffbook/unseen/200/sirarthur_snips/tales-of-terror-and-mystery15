I
actually
began
to
slide
backwards.
My
sopped
and
dripping
wings
had
made
me
heavier
than
I
thought,
but
presently
I
was
in
lighter
cloud,
and
soon
had
cleared
the
first
layer.
There
was
a
second
opal
coloured
and
fleecy
at
a
great
height
above
my
head,
a
white,
unbroken
ceiling
above,
and
a
dark,
unbroken
floor
below,
with
the
monoplane
labouring
upwards
upon
a
vast
spiral
between
them.
It
is
deadly
lonely
in
these
cloud
spaces.
Once
a
great
flight
of
some
small
water
birds
went
past
me,
flying
very
fast
to
the
westwards.
The
quick
whir
of
their
wings
and
their
musical
cry
were
cheery
to
my
ear.
I
fancy
that
they
were
teal,
but
I
am
a
wretched
zoologist.
Now
that
we
humans
have
become
birds
we
must
really
learn
to
know
our
brethren
by
sight.
"The
wind
down
beneath
me
whirled
and
swayed
the
broad
cloud
plain.
Once
a
great
eddy
formed
in
it,
a
whirlpool
of
vapour,
and
through
it,
as
down
a
funnel,
I
caught
sight
of
the
distant
world.
A
large
white
biplane
was
passing
at
a
vast
depth
beneath
me.
I
fancy
it
was
the
morning
mail
service
betwixt
Bristol
and
London.
