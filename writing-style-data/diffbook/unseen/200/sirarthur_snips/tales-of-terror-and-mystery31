the
deadly
jungle
of
the
outer
air.
"Once
out
of
danger
I
throttled
my
engine,
for
nothing
tears
a
machine
to
pieces
quicker
than
running
on
full
power
from
a
height.
It
was
a
glorious,
spiral
vol
plane
from
nearly
eight
miles
of
altitude
first,
to
the
level
of
the
silver
cloud
bank,
then
to
that
of
the
storm
cloud
beneath
it,
and
finally,
in
beating
rain,
to
the
surface
of
the
earth.
I
saw
the
Bristol
Channel
beneath
me
as
I
broke
from
the
clouds,
but,
having
still
some
petrol
in
my
tank,
I
got
twenty
miles
inland
before
I
found
myself
stranded
in
a
field
half
a
mile
from
the
village
of
Ashcombe.
There
I
got
three
tins
of
petrol
from
a
passing
motor
car,
and
at
ten
minutes
past
six
that
evening
I
alighted
gently
in
my
own
home
meadow
at
Devizes,
after
such
a
journey
as
no
mortal
upon
earth
has
ever
yet
taken
and
lived
to
tell
the
tale.
I
have
seen
the
beauty
and
I
have
seen
the
horror
of
the
heights
and
greater
beauty
or
greater
horror
than
that
is
not
within
the
ken
of
man.
"And
now
it
is
my
plan
