entered.
"Ask
Lady
Rossiter
to
have
the
goodness
to
step
this
way,"
said
his
lordship,
and
a
few
moments
later
the
lady
was
ushered
into
the
room.
She
was
a
small,
middle
aged
woman,
very
like
Lord
Linchmere
in
appearance,
with
the
same
quick,
alert
features
and
grey
black
hair.
The
expression
of
anxiety,
however,
which
I
had
observed
upon
his
face
was
very
much
more
marked
upon
hers.
Some
great
grief
seemed
to

is
the
very
man
for
our
purpose,
Evelyn,"
said
Lord
Linchmere.
"He
is
actually
a
collector
of
beetles,
and
he
has
written
articles
upon
the
subject."
"Really!"
said
Lady
Rossiter.
"Then
you
must
have
heard
of
my
husband.
Everyone
who
knows
anything
about
beetles
must
have
heard
of
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter."
For
the
first
time
a
thin
little
ray
of
light
