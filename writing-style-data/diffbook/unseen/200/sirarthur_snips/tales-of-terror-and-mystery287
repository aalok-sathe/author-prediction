in
which
it
was
situated,
with
a
low
ceiling,
a
single
narrow,
ivy
wreathed
window,
and
the
simplest
of
furniture.
An
old
carpet,
a
single
chair,
a
deal
table,
and
a
small
shelf
of
books
made
up
the
whole

On
the
table

That
very
afternoon
he
came
to
me,
all

and
walked
up
and

the
garden
path
with
me,
while
my
two
charges
played
tennis
upon
the
lawn
beside
us.
"You
hardly
realize
the
exception
which
has
been
made
in
your
favour,"
said
he.
"That
room
