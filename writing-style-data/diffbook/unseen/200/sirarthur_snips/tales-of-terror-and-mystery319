healthy
man.
Arthur
Morton
had
then
removed
his
sister's
photograph,
and
had
made
his
way
homeward,
stepping
aside
into
the
laurel
bushes
to
avoid
Mrs.
Madding
at
the
gate.
This
was
the
theory
of
the
prosecution,
and
the
case
which
they
presented
was
a
formidable
one.
On
the
other
hand,
there
were
some
strong
points
for
the
defence.
Morton
was
high
spirited
and
impetuous,
like
his
sister,
but
he
was
respected
and
liked
by
everyone,
and
his
frank
and
honest
nature
seemed
to
be
incapable
of
such
a
crime.
His
own
explanation
was
that
he
was
anxious
to
have
a
conversation
with
Dr.
Lana
about
some
urgent
family
matters
(from
first
to
last
he
refused
even
to
mention
the
name
of
his
sister).
He
did
not
attempt
to
deny
that
this
conversation
would
probably
have
been
of
an
unpleasant
nature.
He
had
heard
from
a
patient
that
the
doctor
was
out,
and
he
therefore
waited
until
about
three
in
the
morning
for
his
return,
but
as
he
had
seen
nothing
of
him
up
to
that
hour,
he
had
given
it
up
and
had
returned
home.
As
to
his
death,
he
knew
no
more
about
it
than
the
constable
who
arrested
