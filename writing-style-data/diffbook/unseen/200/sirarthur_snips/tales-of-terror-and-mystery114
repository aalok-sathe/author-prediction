dare
venture
farther
into
this
dangerous
labyrinth,
when
my
eyes
fell
upon
something
at
my
feet
which
strongly
arrested
my
attention.
The
greater
part
of
the
floor
of
the
cavern
was
covered
with
boulders
of
rock
or
with
hard
incrustations
of
lime,
but
at
this
particular
point
there
had
been
a
drip
from
the
distant
roof,
which
had
left
a
patch
of
soft
mud.
In
the
very
centre
of
this
there
was
a
huge
mark
an
ill
defined
blotch,
deep,
broad
and
irregular,
as
if
a
great
boulder
had
fallen
upon
it.
No
loose
stone
lay
near,
however,
nor
was
there
anything
to
account
for
the
impression.
It
was
far
too
large
to
be
caused
by
any
possible
animal,
and
besides,
there
was
only
the
one,
and
the
patch
of
mud
was
of
such
a
size
that
no
reasonable
stride
could
have
covered
it.
As
I
rose
from
the
examination
of
that
singular
mark
and
then
looked
round
into
the
black
shadows
which
hemmed
me
in,
I
must
confess
that
I
felt
for
a
moment
a
most
unpleasant
sinking
of
my
heart,
and
that,
do
what
I
could,
the
candle
trembled
in
my
outstretched
hand.
I
soon
recovered
my
nerve,
