cut
away
and
made
top
heavy
by
the
rush
of
the
stream,
so
that
it
tilted
over
as
I
landed
on
it
and
shot
me
into
the
ice
cold
water.
My
candle
went
out,
and
I
found
myself
floundering
about
in
utter
and
absolute
darkness.
I
staggered
to
my
feet
again,
more
amused
than
alarmed
by
my
adventure.
The
candle
had
fallen
from
my
hand,
and
was
lost
in
the
stream,
but
I
had
two
others
in
my
pocket,
so
that
it
was
of
no
importance.
I
got
one
of
them
ready,
and
drew
out
my
box
of
matches
to
light
it.
Only
then
did
I
realize
my
position.
The
box
had
been
soaked
in
my
fall
into
the
river.
It
was
impossible
to
strike
the
matches.
A
cold
hand
seemed
to
close
round
my
heart
as
I
realized
my
position.
The
darkness
was
opaque
and
horrible.
It
was
so
utter
one
put
one's
hand
up
to
one's
face
as
if
to
press
off
something
solid.
I
stood
still,
and
by
an
effort
I
steadied
myself.
I
tried
to
reconstruct
in
my
mind
a
map
of
the
floor
of
the
cavern
as
I
had
last
seen
it.
Alas!
the
bearings
