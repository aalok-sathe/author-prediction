two
little
boys
of
our
own.
But,
there
I
have
already
revealed
what
it
was
which
I
gained
in
Thorpe
Place!
It
was
a
very,
very
old
house,
incredibly
old
pre
Norman,
some
of
it
and
the
Bollamores
claimed
to
have
lived
in
that
situation
since
long
before
the
Conquest.
It
struck
a
chill
to
my
heart
when
first
I
came
there,
those
enormously
thick
grey
walls,
the
rude
crumbling
stones,
the
smell
as
from
a
sick
animal
which
exhaled
from
the
rotting
plaster
of
the
aged
building.
But
the
modern
wing
was
bright
and
the
garden
was
well
kept.
No
house
could
be
dismal
which
had
a
pretty
girl
inside
it
and
such
a
show
of
roses
in
front.
Apart
from
a
very
complete
staff
of
servants
there
were
only
four
of
us
in
the
household.
These
were
Miss
Witherton,
who
was
at
that
time
four
and
twenty
and
as
pretty
well,
as
pretty
as
Mrs.
Colmore
is
now
myself,
Frank
Colmore,
aged
thirty,
Mrs.
Stevens,
the
housekeeper,
a
dry,
silent
woman,
and
Mr.
Richards,
a
tall
military
looking
man,
who
acted
as
steward
to
the
Bollamore
estates.
We
four
always
had
our
meals
together,
but
