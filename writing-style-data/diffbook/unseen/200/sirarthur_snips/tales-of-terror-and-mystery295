floor.
There
were
numerous
cottages
in
the
immediate
vicinity.
The
other
end
of
the
secret
passage
might
lie
among
some
tangle
of
bramble
in
the
neighbouring
copse.
I
said
nothing
to
anyone,
but
I
felt
that
the
secret
of
my
employer
lay
within
my
power.
And
the
more
convinced
I
was
of
this
the
more
I
marvelled
at
the
manner
in
which
he
concealed
his
true
nature.
Often
as
I
watched
his
austere
figure,
I
asked
myself
if
it
were
indeed
possible
that
such
a
man
should
be
living
this
double
life,
and
I
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
my
suspicions
might
after
all
prove
to
be
ill
founded.
But
there
was
the
female
voice,
there
was
the
secret
nightly
rendezvous
in
the
turret
chamber
how
could
such
facts
admit
of
an
innocent
interpretation.
I
conceived
a
horror
of
the
man.
I
was
filled
with
loathing
at
his
deep,
consistent
hypocrisy.
Only
once
during
all
those
months
did
I
ever
see
him
without
that
sad
but
impassive
mask
which
he
usually
presented
towards
his
fellow
man.
For
an
instant
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
those
volcanic
fires
which
he
had
damped
down
so
long.
The
occasion
was
an
unworthy
one,
