darkly
all
round
me.
A
dim
radiance
from
the
moonlight
came
through
the
farther
window,
and
against
this
lighter
background
I
saw
that
Sir
John
Bollamore
was
sitting
at
his
study
table.
His
well
set
head
and
clearly
cut
profile
were
sharply
outlined
against
the
glimmering
square
behind
him.
He
bent
as
I
watched
him,
and
I
heard
the
sharp
turning
of
a
key
and
the
rasping
of
metal
upon

As
if
in
a
dream
I
was
vaguely

I
was
intruding
upon
his
privacy,
that
he
imagined
himself
to
be
alone
in
the
room.
And
then,
just
as
it
rushed
upon
my
horrified
perceptions,
and
I
had
half
risen
to
announce
my
presence,
I
heard
a
strange,
crisp,
metallic
clicking,
and
then
the
voice.
Yes,
it
was
a
woman's
voice;
there
could
not
be
a
doubt
of
it.
But
a
voice
so
charged
with
entreaty
and
with
yearning
love,
that
