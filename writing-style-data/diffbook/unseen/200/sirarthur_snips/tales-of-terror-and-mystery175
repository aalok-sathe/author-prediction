near
the
bars,
with
his
back
still
towards
me.
"Down,
you
stupid
beast!"
he
roared.
"Down,
sir!
Don't
you
know
your
master?"
Suddenly
even
in
my
bemuddled
brain
a
remembrance
came
of
those
words
of
his
when
he
had
said
that
the
taste
of
blood
would
turn
the
cat
into
a
fiend.
My
blood
had
done
it,
but
he
was
to
pay
the
price.
"Get
away!"
he
screamed.
"Get
away,
you
devil!
Baldwin!
Baldwin!
Oh,
my
God!"
And
then
I
heard

fall,
and
rise,
and
fall

with
a
sound
like
the
ripping

sacking.
His
screams
grew
fainter
until
they
were
lost
in
the
worrying
snarl.
And
then,
after
I
thought
that
he
was
dead,
I
saw,
as
in
a
nightmare,
a
blinded,
tattered,
blood
soaked
figure
running
wildly
round
the
room
and
that
was
the
last
glimpse
which
I
had
of
him
before
I
fainted
once
again.
I
was
many
months
in
my
recovery
in
fact,
I
cannot
say
that
I
have
ever
recovered,
for
to
the
end
of
my
days
I
shall
carry
a
stick
as
a
sign
of
my
night
with
the
Brazilian
cat.
Baldwin,
the
groom,
and
the
other
servants
could
not
