very
man
I
wanted.
A
stout
companion
was
necessary,
for
I
knew
that
the
lunacy
could
only
be
proved
by
a
murderous
assault,
and
I
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
that
assault
would
be
made
upon
myself,
since
he
had
the
warmest
regard
for
me
in
his
moments
of
sanity.
I
think
your
intelligence
will
supply
all
the
rest.
I
did
not
know
that
the
attack
would
come
by
night,
but
I
thought
it
very
probable,
for
the
crises
of
such
cases
usually
do
occur
in
the

of
the

I
am
a
very
nervous
man
myself,
but
I
saw
no
other
way
in
which
I
could
remove
this
terrible
danger
from
my
sister's
life.
I
need
not
ask
you

"Undoubtedly.
But
TWO
signatures
are
necessary."
"You
forget
that
I
am
myself
a
holder
of
a
medical
degree.
I
have
the
papers
on
a
side
table
here,
so
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
sign
them
now,
we
can
have
the
patient
removed
in
the
morning."
So
that
was
my
visit
to
Sir
Thomas
Rossiter,
the
famous
beetle
hunter,
and
that
was
also
my
first
step
