the
published
depth
of
the
canal,
which
was
entirely
insufficient
to
conceal
so
large
an
object.
The
second
correspondent
wrote
calling
attention
to
the
bag
which
appeared
to
be
the
sole
luggage
which
the
travellers
had
brought
with
them,
and
suggesting
that
some
novel
explosive
of
immense
and
pulverizing
power
might
have
been
concealed
in
it.
The
obvious
absurdity,
however,
of
supposing
that
the

train
might
be
blown
to
dust
while
the
metals
remained
uninjured
reduced
any
such
explanation
to
a

The

came
to

Some
doubts
were
expressed
as
to
its
genuine
character
but
Mrs.
McPherson
was
positive
as
to
the
writing,
and
the
fact
that
it
contained
a
remittance
of
a
hundred
dollars
in
five
