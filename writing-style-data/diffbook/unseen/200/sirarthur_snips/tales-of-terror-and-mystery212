actually
jump
it,
and
indeed
it
was
not
very
far
from
doing
so.
Fortunately,
however,
it
fell
short,
and
the
buffers
of
the
engine
struck
the
other
lip
of
the
shaft
with
a
tremendous
crash.
The
funnel
flew
off
into
the
air.
The
tender,
carriages,
and
van
were
all
smashed
up
into
one
jumble,
which,
with
the
remains
of
the
engine,
choked
for
a
minute
or
so
the
mouth
of
the
pit.
Then
something
gave
way
in
the
middle,
and
the
whole
mass
of
green
iron,
smoking
coals,
brass
fittings,
wheels,
wood
work,
and
cushions
all
crumbled
together
and
crashed
down
into
the
mine.
We
heard
the
rattle,
rattle,
rattle,
as
the
debris
struck
against
the
walls,
and
then,
quite
a
long
time
afterwards,
there
came
a
deep
roar
as
the
remains
of
the
train
struck
the
bottom.
The
boiler
may
have
burst,
for
a
sharp
crash
came
after
the
roar,
and
then
a
dense
cloud
of
steam
and
smoke
swirled
up
out
of
the
black
depths,
falling
in
a
spray
as
thick
as
rain
all
round
us.
Then
the
vapour
shredded
off
into
thin
wisps,
which
floated
away
in
the
summer
sunshine,
and
all
was
quiet
again
in
the
