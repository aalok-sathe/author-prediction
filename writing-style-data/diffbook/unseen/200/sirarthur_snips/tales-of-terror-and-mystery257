be
a
mistake,
however,
to
suppose
that
no
theories
were
formed
to
account
for
the
facts.
On
the
contrary,
the
Press,
both
in
England
and
in
America,
teemed
with
suggestions
and
suppositions,
most
of
which
were
obviously
absurd.
The
fact
that
the
watches
were
of
American
make,
and
some
peculiarities
in
connection
with
the
gold
stopping
of
his
front
tooth,
appeared
to
indicate
that
the
deceased
was
a
citizen
of
the
United
States,
though
his
linen,
clothes
and
boots
were
undoubtedly
of
British
manufacture.
It
was
surmised,
by
some,
that
he
was
concealed
under
the
seat,
and
that,
being
discovered,
he
was
for
some
reason,
possibly
because
he
had
overheard
their
guilty
secrets,
put
to
death
by
his
fellow
passengers.
When
coupled
with
generalities
as
to
the
ferocity
and
cunning
of
anarchical
and
other
secret
societies,
this
theory
sounded
as
plausible
as
any.
The
fact
that
he
should
be
without
a
ticket
would
be
consistent
with
the
idea
of
concealment,
and
it
was
well
known
that
women
played
a
prominent
part
in
the
Nihilistic
propaganda.
On
the
other
hand,
it
was
clear,
from
the
guard's
statement,
that
the
man
must
have
been
hidden
there
BEFORE
the
others
arrived,
and
