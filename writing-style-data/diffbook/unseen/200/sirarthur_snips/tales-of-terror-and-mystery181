the
facts
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain
them.
They
are
collated
from
the
Liverpool
papers
of
that
date,
from
the
proceedings
at
the
inquest
upon
John
Slater,
the
engine
driver,
and
from
the
records
of
the
London
and
West
Coast
Railway
Company,
which
have
been
courteously
put
at
my
disposal.
Briefly,
they
are
as
follows:
On
the
3rd
of
June,
1890,
a
gentleman,
who
gave
his
name
as
Monsieur
Louis
Caratal,
desired
an
interview
with
Mr.
James
Bland,
the
superintendent
of
the
London
and
West
Coast
Central
Station
in
Liverpool.
He
was
a
small
man,
middle
aged
and
dark,
with
a
stoop
which
was
so
marked
that
it
suggested
some
deformity
of
the
spine.
He
was
accompanied
by
a
friend,
a
man
of
imposing
physique,
whose
deferential
manner
and
constant
attention
showed
that
his
position
was
one
of
dependence.
This
friend
or
companion,
whose
name
did
not
transpire,
was
certainly
a
foreigner,
and
probably
from
his
swarthy
complexion,
either
a
Spaniard
or
a
South
American.
One
peculiarity
was
observed
in
him.
He
carried
in
his
left
hand
a
small
black,
leather
dispatch
box,
and
it
was
noticed
by
a
sharp
eyed
clerk
in
the
Central
office
