coming
beyond
all
question
in
my
direction.
My
skin
grew
cold,
and
my
hair
stood
on
end
as
I
listened
to
that
steady
and
ponderous
footfall.
There
was
some
creature
there,
and
surely
by
the
speed
of
its
advance,
it
was
one
which
could
see
in
the
dark.
I
crouched
low
on
my
rock
and
tried
to
blend
myself
into
it.
The
steps
grew
nearer
still,
then
stopped,
and
presently
I
was
aware
of
a
loud
lapping
and
gurgling.
The
creature
was
drinking
at
the
stream.
Then
again
there
was
silence,
broken
by
a
succession
of
long
sniffs
and
snorts
of
tremendous
volume
and
energy.
Had
it
caught
the
scent
of
me?
My
own
nostrils
were
filled
by
a
low
fetid
odour,
mephitic
and
abominable.
Then
I
heard
the
steps
again.
They
were
on
my
side
of
the
stream
now.
The
stones
rattled
within
a
few
yards
of
where
I
lay.
Hardly
daring
to
breathe,
I
crouched
upon
my
rock.
Then
the
steps
drew
away.
I
heard
the
splash
as
it
returned
across
the
river,
and
the
sound
died
away
into
the
distance
in
the
direction
from
which
it
had
come.
For
a
long
time
I
lay
upon
the
rock,
