me
to
give
you
my
thanks
for
having
come,
and
to
call
in
some
other
surgeon
before
it
is
too
late."
Douglas
Stone
hesitated.
To
refund
that
hundred
pounds
was
no
pleasant
matter.
But
of
course
if
he

talk
and

thought,
and
there
was
no

wrangling.
Douglas
Stone

bistoury
from
his
case,
opened

and
felt
the
keen
