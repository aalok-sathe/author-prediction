a
first
class,
a
first
class
smoking,
a
second
class,
and
a
second
class
smoking.
The
first
compartment,
which
was
nearest
to
the
engine,
was
the
one
allotted
to
the
travellers.
The
other
three
were
empty.
The
guard
of
the
special
train
was
James
McPherson,
who
had
been
some
years
in
the
service
of
the
company.
The
stoker,
William
Smith,
was
a
new
hand.
Monsieur
Caratal,
upon
leaving
the
superintendent's
office,
rejoined
his
companion,
and
both
of
them
manifested
extreme
impatience
to
be
off.
Having
paid
the
money
asked,
which
amounted
to
fifty

shillings,
at
the
usual
special
rate
of
five
shillings
a
mile,
they
demanded
to
be
shown
the
carriage,
and
at
once
took
their
seats
in
it,
although
they
were
assured
that
the
better
part
of
an
hour
must
elapse
before
the
line
could
be
cleared.
In
the
meantime
a
singular
coincidence
had
occurred
in
the
office
which
Monsieur
Caratal
had
just
quitted.
A
request
for
a
special
is
not
a
very
uncommon
circumstance
in
a
rich
commercial
centre,
but
that
two
should
be
required
upon
the
same
afternoon
was
most
unusual.
It
so
happened,
however,
that
Mr.
Bland
had
hardly
dismissed
the
first
traveller
before
