he
brewed
himself
a
glass
of
grog,
in
which
I
could
not
help
noticing
that
the
whisky
considerably
predominated
over
the
water.
"My
word!"
said
he,
"what
a
night!"
It
was,
indeed.
The
wind
was
howling
and
screaming
round
the
house,
and
the
latticed
windows
rattled
and
shook
as
if
they
were
coming
in.
The
glow
of
the
yellow
lamps
and
the
flavour
of
our
cigars
seemed
the
brighter
and
more
fragrant
for
the
contrast.
"Now,
my
boy,"
said
my
host,
"we
have
the
house
and
the
night
to
ourselves.
Let
me
have
an
idea
of
how
your
affairs
stand,
and
I
will
see
what
can
be
done
to
set
them
in
order.
I
wish
to
hear
every
detail."
Thus
encouraged,
I
entered
into
a
long
exposition,
in
which
all
my
tradesmen
and
creditors
from
my
landlord
to
my
valet,
figured
in
turn.
I
had
notes
in
my
pocket
book,
and
I
marshalled
my
facts,
and
gave,
I
flatter
myself,
a
very
businesslike
statement
of
my
own
unbusinesslike
ways
and
lamentable
position.
I
was
depressed,
however,
to
notice
that
my
companion's
eyes
were
vacant
and
his
attention
elsewhere.
When
he
did
occasionally
throw
out
a
remark
it
was
so
entirely
