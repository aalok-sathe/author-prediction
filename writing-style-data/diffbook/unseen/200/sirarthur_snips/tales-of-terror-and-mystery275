round,'
said
he.
"'Nor
then,
either,'
said
I,
and
taking
the
bag
I
slung
it
with
all
my
force
out
of
the
window.
'Now,'
said
I,
'you'll
never
make
a
Mary
Jane
of
yourself
while
I
can
help
it.
If
nothing
but
that
disguise
stands
between
you
and
a
gaol,
then
to
gaol
you
shall
go.'
"That
was
the
way
to
manage
him.
I
felt
my
advantage
at
once.
His
supple
nature
was
one
which
yielded
to
roughness
far
more
readily
than
to
entreaty.
He
flushed
with
shame,
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears.
But
MacCoy
saw
my
advantage
also,
and
was
determined
that
I
should
not
pursue
it.
"'He's
my
pard,
and
you
shall
not
bully
him,'
he
cried.
"'He's
my
brother,
and
you
shall
not
ruin
him,'
said
I.
'I
believe
a
spell
of
prison
is
the
very
best
way
of
keeping
you
apart,
and
you
shall
have
it,
or
it
will
be
no
fault
of
mine.'
"'Oh,
you
would
squeal,
would
you?'
he
cried,
and
in
an
instant
he
whipped
out
his
revolver.
I
sprang
for
his
hand,
but
saw
that
I
was
too
late,
and
jumped
aside.
At
the
same
instant
he
fired,
and
the
bullet
