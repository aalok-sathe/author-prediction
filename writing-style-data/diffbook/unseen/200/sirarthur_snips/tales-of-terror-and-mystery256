of
the
affair
might
be
surmised
without
any
great
breach
of
probability.
But
what
the
second
stage
had
been,
or
how
the
final
one
had
been
arrived
at,
neither
the
guard
nor
the
experienced
detective
officers
could
suggest.
A
careful
examination
of
the
line
between
Willesden
and
Rugby
resulted
in
one
discovery
which
might
or
might
not
have
a
bearing
upon
the
tragedy.
Near
Tring,
at
the
very
place
where
the
train
slowed
down,
there
was
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
embankment
a
small
pocket
Testament,
very
shabby
and
worn.
It
was
printed
by
the
Bible
Society
of
London,
and
bore
an
inscription:
"From
John
to
Alice.
Jan.
13th,
1856,"
upon
the
fly
leaf.
Underneath
was
written:
"James.
July
4th,
1859,"
and
beneath
that
again:
"Edward.
Nov.
1st,
1869,"
all
the
entries
being
in
the
same
handwriting.
This
was
the
only
clue,
if
it
could
be
called
a
clue,
which
the
police
obtained,
and
the
coroner's
verdict
of
"Murder
by
a
person
or
persons
unknown"
was
the
unsatisfactory
ending
of
a
singular
case.
Advertisement,
rewards,
and
inquiries
proved
equally
fruitless,
and
nothing
could
be
found
which
was
solid
enough
to
form
the
basis
for
a
profitable
investigation.
It
would
