If
I
were
to
question
you
upon
some
intimate
thing
would
you
give
me
an
answer,
I
wonder!
This
new
catacomb
is
a
very
intimate
thing
to
me,
and
I
should
certainly
expect
some
sign
of
confidence
in
return."
"What
you
are
driving
at
I
cannot
imagine,"
said
the
Englishman,
"but
if
you
mean
that
you
will
answer
my
question
about
the
catacomb
if
I
answer
any
question
which
you
may
put
to
me
I
can
assure
you
that
I
will
certainly
do
so."
"Well,
then,"
said
Burger,
leaning
luxuriously
back
in
his
settee,
and
puffing
a
blue
tree
of
cigar
smoke
into
the
air,
"tell
me
all
about
your
relations
with
Miss
Mary
Saunderson."
Kennedy
sprang
up
in
his
chair
and
glared
angrily
at
his
impassive
companion.
"What
the
devil
do
you
mean?"
he
cried.
"What
sort
of
a
question
is
this?
You
may
mean
it
as
a
joke,
but
you
never
made
a
worse
one."
"No,
I
don't
mean
it
as
a
joke,"
said
Burger,
simply.
"I
am
really
rather
interested
in
the
details
of
the
matter.
I
don't
know
much
about
the
world
and
women
and
social
life
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
such
an
incident
