sad
a
one!
So
sad
a
one!
You
have
not,
perhaps
heard
of
the
daggers
of
the
Almohades?"
"Never."
"Ah,
they
are
Eastern
daggers
of
a
great
age
and
of
a
singular
shape,
with
the
hilt
like
what
you
call
a
stirrup.
I
am
a
curiosity
dealer,
you
understand,
and
that
is
why
I
have
come
to
England
from
Smyrna,
but
next
week
I
go
back
once
more.
Many
things
I
brought
with
me,
and
I
have
a
few
things
left,
but
among
them,
to
my
sorrow,
is
one
of
these
daggers."
"You
will
remember
that
I
have
an
appointment,
sir,"
said
the
surgeon,
with
some
irritation;
"pray
confine
yourself
to
the
necessary
details."
"You
will
see
that
it
is
necessary.
Today
my
wife
fell
down
in
a
faint
in
the
room
in
which
I
keep
my
wares,
and
she
cut
her
lower
lip
upon
this
cursed
dagger
of
Almohades."
"I
see,"
said
Douglas
Stone,
rising.
"And
you
wish
me
to
dress
the
wound?"
"No,
no,
it
is
worse
than
that."
"What
then?"
"These
daggers
are
poisoned."
"Poisoned!"
"Yes,
and
there
is
no
man,
East
or
West,
who
can
tell
now
what
is
the
poison
or
what
the
cure.
But
