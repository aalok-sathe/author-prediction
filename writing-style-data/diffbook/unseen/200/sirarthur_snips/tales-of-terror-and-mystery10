'all
slimy
with
grease,'
said
somebody
at
the
inquest.
Queer
that
nobody
got
thinking
after
that!
I
did
but,
then,
I
had
been
thinking
for
a
good
long
time.
I've
made
three
ascents
how
Dangerfield
used
to
chaff
me
about
my
shot
gun
but
I've
never
been
high
enough.
Now,
with
this
new,
light
Paul
Veroner
machine
and
its
one
hundred
and
seventy

Robur,
I
should
easily
touch
the
thirty
thousand
tomorrow.
I'll
have
a
shot
at
the
record.
Maybe
I
shall
have
a
shot
at
something
else
as
well.
Of
course,
it's
dangerous.
If
a
fellow
wants
to
avoid
danger
he
had
best
keep
out
of
flying
altogether
and
subside
finally
into
flannel
slippers
and
a
dressing
gown.
But
I'll
visit
the
air
jungle
tomorrow
and
if
there's
anything
there
I
shall
know
it.
If
I
return,
I'll
find
myself
a
bit
of
a
celebrity.
If
I
don't
this
note
book
may
explain
what
I
am
trying
to
do,
and
how
I
lost
my
life
in
doing
it.
But
no
drivel
about
accidents
or
mysteries,
if
YOU
please.
