subtle
way
he
divined
the
sympathy
which
I
had
for
him,
and
he
showed
in
his
own
silent
fashion
that
he
appreciated
it.
He
even
invited
me
once
to
share
his
afternoon
walk,
and
although
no
word
passed
between
us
on
this
occasion,
it
was
a
mark
of
confidence
which
he
had
never
shown
to
anyone
before.
He
asked
me
also
to
index
his
library
(it
was
one
of
the
best
private
libraries
in
England),
and
I
spent
many
hours
in
the
evening
in
his
presence,
if
not
in
his
society,
he
reading
at
his
desk
and
I
sitting
in
a
recess
by
the
window
reducing
to
order
the
chaos
which
existed
among
his
books.
In
spite
of
these
close
relations
I
was
never
again
asked
to
enter
the
chamber
in
the
turret.
And
then
came
my
revulsion
of
feeling.
A
single
incident
changed
all
my
sympathy
to
loathing,
and
made
me
realize
that
my
employer
still
remained
all
that
he
had
ever
been,
with
the
additional
vice
of
hypocrisy.
What
happened
was
as
follows.
One
evening
Miss
Witherton
had
gone
down
to
Broadway,
the
neighbouring
village,
to
sing
at
a
concert
for
some
charity,
and
I,
according
to
my
