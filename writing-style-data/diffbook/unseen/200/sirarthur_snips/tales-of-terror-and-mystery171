then
the
cat
sprang!
It
was
so
quick,
so
sudden,
that
I
never
saw
it
happen.
I
simply
heard
the
savage
snarl,
and
in
an
instant
afterwards
the
blazing
yellow
eyes,
the
flattened
black
head
with
its
red
tongue
and
flashing
teeth,
were
within
reach
of
me.
The
impact
of
the
creature
shook
the
bars
upon
which
I
lay,
until
I
thought
(as
far
as
I
could
think
of
anything
at
such
a
moment)
that
they
were
coming
down.
The
cat
swayed
there
for
an
instant,
the
head
and
front
paws
quite
close
to
me,
the
hind
paws
clawing
to
find
a
grip
upon
the
edge
of
the
grating.
I
heard
the
claws
rasping
as
they
clung
to
the
wire
netting,
and
the
breath
of
the
beast
made
me
sick.
But
its
bound
had
been
miscalculated.
It
could
not
retain
its
position.
Slowly,
grinning
with
rage,
and
scratching
madly
at
the
bars,
it
swung
backwards
and
dropped
heavily
upon
the
floor.
With
a
growl
it
instantly
faced
round
to
me
and
crouched
for
another
spring.
I
knew
that
the
next
few
moments
would
decide
my
fate.
The
creature
had
learned
by
experience.
It
would
not
miscalculate
again.
I
must
act
