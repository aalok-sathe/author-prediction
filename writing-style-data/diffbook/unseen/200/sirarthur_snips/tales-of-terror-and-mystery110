abruptness.
And
now
comes
the
queer
point
about
the
whole
business.
I
was
still
standing
near
the
mouth
of
the
cave
turning
over
in
my
mind
the
various
statements
of
Armitage,
and
reflecting
how
readily
they
could
be
explained
away,
when
suddenly,
from
the
depth
of
the
tunnel
beside
me,
there
issued
a
most
extraordinary
sound.
How
shall
I
describe
it?
First
of
all,
it
seemed
to
be
a
great
distance
away,
far
down
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth.
Secondly,
in
spite
of
this
suggestion
of
distance,
it
was
very
loud.
Lastly,
it
was
not
a
boom,
nor
a
crash,
such
as
one
would
associate
with
falling
water
or
tumbling
rock,
but
it
was
a
high
whine,
tremulous
and
vibrating,
almost
like
the
whinnying
of
a
horse.
It
was
certainly
a
most
remarkable
experience,
and
one
which
for
a
moment,
I
must
admit,
gave
a
new
significance
to
Armitage's
words.
I
waited
by
the
Blue
John
Gap
for
half
an
hour
or
more,
but
there
was
no
return
of
the
sound,
so
at
last
I
wandered
back
to
the
farmhouse,
rather
mystified
by
what
had
occurred.
Decidedly
I
shall
explore
that
cavern
when
my
strength
is
restored.
Of
course,
