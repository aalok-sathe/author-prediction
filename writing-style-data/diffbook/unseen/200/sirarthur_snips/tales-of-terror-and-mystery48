other
curious
objects,
and
a
number
of
swinging
cords
which
played
over
pulleys.
It
was
not
unlike
a
modern
gymnasium.
When
the
room
had
been
cleared
there
appeared
a
new
figure
upon
the
scene.
This
was
a
tall,
thin
person
clad
in
black,
with
a
gaunt
and
austere
face.
The
aspect
of
the
man
made
me
shudder.
His
clothes
were
all
shining

stains.
He

even
defiant.
But
it
was
very
different
with
the
priest.
His
face
was
ghastly
white,
and
I
saw
the
moisture
glisten
and
run
on
his
high,
sloping
forehead.
He
threw
up
his
hands
in
prayer
and
he
stooped
continually
to
mutter
frantic
words
in
the
lady's
ear.
