who
can
understand
and
advise.
April
25.
I
was
laid
up
in
bed
for
two
days
after
my
incredible
adventure
in
the
cavern.
I
use
the
adjective
with
a
very
definite
meaning,
for
I
have
had
an
experience
since
which
has
shocked
me
almost
as
much
as
the
other.
I
have
said
that
I
was
looking
round
for
someone
who
could
advise
me.
There
is
a
Dr.
Mark
Johnson
who
practices
some
few
miles
away,
to
whom
I
had
a
note
of
recommendation
from
Professor
Saunderson.
To
him
I
drove,
when
I
was
strong
enough
to
get
about,
and
I
recounted
to
him
my
whole
strange
experience.
He
listened
intently,
and
then
carefully
examined
me,
paying
special
attention
to
my
reflexes
and
to
the
pupils
of
my
eyes.
When
he
had
finished,
he
refused
to
discuss
my
adventure,
saying
that
it
was
entirely
beyond
him,
but
he
gave
me
the
card
of
a
Mr.
Picton
at
Castleton,
with
the
advice
that
I
should
instantly
go
to
him
and
tell
him
the
story
exactly
as
I
had
done
to
himself.
He
was,
according
to
my
adviser,
the
very
man
who
was
pre
eminently
suited
to
help
me.
I
went
on
to
