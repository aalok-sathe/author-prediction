them
clear
of
his
premises.
He
was
a
taciturn,
serious
man
the
rest
of
the
day.
He
did
not
even
bandy
a
repartee
with
Joe
Scott,
who,
for
his
part,
said
to
his
master
only
just
what
was
absolutely
necessary
to
the
progress
of
business,
but
looked
at
him
a
good
deal
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes,
frequently
came
to
poke
the
counting
house
fire
for
him,
and
once,
as
he
was
locking
up
for
the
day
(the
mill
was
then
working
short
time,
owing
to
the
slackness
of
trade),
observed
that
it
was
a
grand
evening,
and
he
"could
wish
Mr.
Moore
to
take
a
bit
of
a
walk
up
th'
Hollow.
It
would
do
him
good."
At
this
recommendation
Mr.
Moore
burst
into
a
short
laugh,
and
after
demanding
of
Joe
what
all
this
solicitude
meant,
and
whether
he
took
him
for
a
woman
or
a
child,
seized
the
keys
from
his
hand,
and
shoved
him
by
the
shoulders
out
of
his
presence.
He
called
him
back,
however,
ere
he
had
reached
the
yard
gate.
"Joe,
do
you
know
those
Farrens?
They
are
not
well
off,
I
suppose?"
"They
cannot
be
well
off,
sir,
when
they've
not
had
work
as
a
three
month.
Ye'd
see
yoursel'
'at
William's
sorely
changed
fair
paired.
They've
selled
most
o'
t'
stuff
out
o'
th'
house."
"He
was
not
a
bad
workman?"
"Ye
never
had
a
better,
sir,
sin'
ye
began
trade."
"And
decent
people
the
whole
family?"
"Niver
dacenter.
Th'
wife's
a
raight
cant
body,
and
as
clean
ye
mught
eat
your
porridge
off
th'
house
floor.
They're
sorely
comed
down.
I
wish
William
could
get
a
job
as
gardener
or
summat
i'
that
way;
he
understands
gardening
weel.
He
once
lived
wi'
a
Scotchman
that
tached
him
the
mysteries
o'
that
craft,
as
they
say."
"Now,
then,
you
can
go,
Joe.
You
need
not
stand
there
staring
at
me."
"Ye've
no
orders
to
give,
sir?"
"None,
but
for
you
to
take
yourself
off."
Which
Joe
did
accordingly.
Spring
evenings
are
often
cold
and
raw,
and
though
this
had
been
a
fine
day,
warm
even
in
the
morning
and
meridian
sunshine,
the
air
chilled
at
sunset,
the
ground
crisped,
and
ere
dusk
a
hoar
frost
was
insidiously
stealing
over
growing
grass
and
unfolding
bud.
It
whitened
the
pavement
in
front
of
Briarmains
(Mr.
Yorke's
residence),
and
made
silent
havoc
among
the
tender
plants
in
his
garden,
and
on
the
mossy
level
of
his
lawn.
As
to
that
great
tree,
strong
trunked
and
broad
armed,
which
guarded
the
gable
nearest
the
road,
it
seemed
to
defy
a
spring
night
frost
to
harm
its
still
bare
boughs;
and
so
did
the
leafless
grove
of
walnut
trees
rising
tall
behind
the
house.
In
the
dusk
of
the
moonless
if
starry
night,
lights
from
windows
shone
vividly.
This
was
no
dark
or
lonely
scene,
nor
even
a
silent
one.
Briarmains
stood
near
the
highway.
It
was
rather
an
old
place,
and
had
been
