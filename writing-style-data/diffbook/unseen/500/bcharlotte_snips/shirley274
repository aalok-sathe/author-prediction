make
them
ten
talents
more.
Not
in
the
dust
of
household
drawers
shall
the
coin
be
interred.
I
will
not
deposit
it
in
a
broken
spouted
teapot,
and
shut
it
up
in
a
china
closet
among
tea
things.
I
will
not
commit
it
to
your
work
table
to
be
smothered
in
piles
of
woollen
hose.
I
will
not
prison
it
in
the
linen
press
to
find
shrouds
among
the
sheets.
And
least
of
all,
mother"
(she
got
up
from
the
floor)
"least
of
all
will
I
hide
it
in
a
tureen
of
cold
potatoes,
to
be
ranged
with
bread,
butter,
pastry,
and
ham
on
the
shelves
of
the
larder."
She
stopped,
then
went
on,
"Mother,
the
Lord
who
gave
each
of
us
our
talents
will
come
home
some
day,
and
will
demand
from
all
an
account.
The
teapot,
the
old
stocking
foot,
the
linen
rag,
the
willow
pattern
tureen
will
yield
up
their
barren
deposit
in
many
a
house.
Suffer
your
daughters,
at
least,
to
put
their
money
to
the
exchangers,
that
they
may
be
enabled
at
the
Master's
coming
to
pay
Him
His
own
with
usury."
"Rose,
did
you
bring
your
sampler
with
you,
as
I
told
you?"
"Yes,
mother."
"Sit
down,
and
do
a
line
of
marking."
Rose
sat
down
promptly,
and
wrought
according
to
orders.
After
a
busy
pause
of
ten
minutes,
her
mother
asked,
"Do
you
think
yourself
oppressed
now
a
victim?"
"No,
mother."
"Yet,
as
far
as
I
understood
your
tirade,
it
was
a
protest
against
all
womanly
and
domestic
employment."
"You
misunderstood
it,
mother.
I
should
be
sorry
not
to
learn
to
sew.
You
do
right
to
teach
me,
and
to
make
me
work."
"Even
to
the
mending
of
your
brothers'
stockings
and
the
making
of
sheets?"
"Yes."
"Where
is
the
use
of
ranting
and
spouting
about
it,
then?"
"Am
I
to
do
nothing
but
that?
I
will
do
that,
and
then
I
will
do
more.
Now,
mother,
I
have
said
my
say.
I
am
twelve
years
old
at
present,
and
not
till
I
am
sixteen
will
I
speak
again
about
talents.
For
four
years
I
bind
myself
an
industrious
apprentice
to
all
you
can
teach
me."
"You
see
what
my
daughters
are,
Miss
Helstone,"
observed
Mrs.
Yorke;
"how
precociously
wise
in
their
own
conceits!
'I
would
rather
this,
I
prefer
that'
such
is
Jessie's
cuckoo
song;
while
Rose
utters
the
bolder
cry,
'I
will,
and
I
will
not!'"
"I
render
a
reason,
mother;
besides,
if
my
cry
is
bold,
it
is
only
heard
once
in
a
twelvemonth.
About
each
birthday
the
spirit
moves
me
to
deliver
one
oracle
respecting
my
own
instruction
and
management.
I
utter
it
and
leave
it;
it
is
for
you,
mother,
to
listen
or
not."
"I
would
advise
all
young
ladies,"
pursued
Mrs.
Yorke,
"to
study
the
characters
of
such
children
as
they
chance
to
meet
with
before
they
marry
and
have
any
of
their
own
to
consider
well
how
they
would
like
the
responsibility
of
guiding
the
careless,
