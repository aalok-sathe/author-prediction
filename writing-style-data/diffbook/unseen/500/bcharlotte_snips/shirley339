ever
complain
to
your
mother
or
sisters?"
"Never.
She
laughs
at
them
when
they
question
her.
Mr.
Moore,
she
is
a
strange
being,
so
fair
and
girlish
not
a
man
like
woman
at
all,
not
an
Amazon,
and
yet
lifting
her
head
above
both
help
and
sympathy."
"Do
you
know
where
she
is
now,
Henry?
Is
she
in
the
house,
or
riding
out?"
"Surely
not
out,
sir.
It
rains
fast."
"True;
which,
however,
is
no
guarantee
that
she
is
not
at
this
moment
cantering
over
Rushedge.
Of
late
she
has
never
permitted
weather
to
be
a
hindrance
to
her
rides."
"You
remember,
Mr.
Moore,
how
wet
and
stormy
it
was
last
Wednesday
so
wild,
indeed,
that
she
would
not
permit
Zoe
to
be
saddled?
Yet
the
blast
she
thought
too
tempestuous
for
her
mare
she
herself
faced
on
foot;
that
afternoon
she
walked
nearly
as
far
as
Nunnely.
I
asked
her,
when
she
came
in,
if
she
was
not
afraid
of
taking
cold.
'Not
I,'
she
said.
'It
would
be
too
much
good
luck
for
me.
I
don't
know,
Harry,
but
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
me
would
be
to
take
a
good
cold
and
fever,
and
so
pass
off
like
other
Christians.'
She
is
reckless,
you
see,
sir."
"Reckless
indeed!
Go
and
find
out
where
she
is,
and
if
you
can
get
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
without
attracting
attention,
request
her
to
come
here
a
minute."
"Yes,
sir."
He
snatched
his
crutch,
and
started
up
to
go.
"Harry!"
He
returned.
"Do
not
deliver
the
message
formally.
Word
it
as,
in
former
days,
you
would
have
worded
an
ordinary
summons
to
the
schoolroom."
"I
see,
sir.
She
will
be
more
likely
to
obey."
"And,
Harry
"
"Sir?"
"I
will
call
you
when
I
want
you.
Till
then,
you
are
dispensed
from
lessons."
He
departed.
Mr.
Moore,
left
alone,
rose
from
his
desk.
"I
can
be
very
cool
and
very
supercilious
with
Henry,"
he
said.
"I
can
seem
to
make
light
of
his
apprehensions,
and
look
down
du
haut
de
ma
grandeur
on
his
youthful
ardour.
To
him
I
can
speak
as
if,
in
my
eyes,
they
were
both
children.
Let
me
see
if
I
can
keep
up
the
same
role
with
her.
I
have
known
the
moment
when
I
seemed
about
to
forget
it,
when
Confusion
and
Submission
seemed
about
to
crush
me
with
their
soft
tyranny,
when
my
tongue
faltered,
and
I
have
almost
let
the
mantle
drop,
and
stood
in
her
presence,
not
master
no
but
something
else.
I
trust
I
shall
never
so
play
the
fool.
It
is
well
for
a
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
to
redden
when
he
meets
her
eye.
He
may
permit
himself
the
indulgence
of
submission.
He
may
even,
without
disgrace,
suffer
his
hand
to
tremble
when
it
touches
hers;
but
if
one
of
her
farmers
were
to
show
himself
susceptible
and
sentimental,
he
would
merely
prove
his
need
of
a
strait
waistcoat.
So
far
I
have
always
done
very
