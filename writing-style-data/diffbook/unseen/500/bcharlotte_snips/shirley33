was
ordinary:
a
racy,
rough
character,
high
or
low,
ever
found
acceptance
with
him;
a
refined,
insipid
personage,
however
exalted
in
station,
was
his
aversion.
He
would
spend
an
hour
any
time
in
talking
freely
with
a
shrewd
workman
of
his
own,
or
with
some
queer,
sagacious
old
woman
amongst
his
cottagers,
when
he
would
have
grudged
a
moment
to
a
commonplace
fine
gentleman
or
to
the
most
fashionable
and
elegant,
if
frivolous,
lady.
His
preferences
on
these
points
he
carried
to
an
extreme,
forgetting
that
there
may
be
amiable
and
even
admirable
characters
amongst
those
who
cannot
be
original.
Yet
he
made
exceptions
to
his
own
rule.
There
was
a
certain
order
of
mind,
plain,
ingenuous,
neglecting
refinement,
almost
devoid
of
intellectuality,
and
quite
incapable
of
appreciating
what
was
intellectual
in
him,
but
which,
at
the
same
time,
never
felt
disgust
at
his
rudeness,
was
not
easily
wounded
by
his
sarcasm,
did
not
closely
analyze
his
sayings,
doings,
or
opinions,
with
which
he
was
peculiarly
at
ease,
and,
consequently,
which
he
peculiarly
preferred.
He
was
lord
amongst
such
characters.
They,
while
submitting
implicitly
to
his
influence,
never
acknowledged,
because
they
never
reflected
on,
his
superiority;
they
were
quite
tractable,
therefore,
without
running
the
smallest
danger
of
being
servile;
and
their
unthinking,
easy,
artless
insensibility
was
as
acceptable,
because
as
convenient,
to
Mr.
Yorke
as
that
of
the
chair
he
sat
on,
or
of
the
floor
he
trod.
It
will
have
been
observed
that
he
was
not
quite
uncordial
with
Mr.
Moore.
He
had
two
or
three
reasons
for
entertaining
a
faint
partiality
to
that
gentleman.
It
may
sound
odd,
but
the
first
of
these
was
that
Moore
spoke
English
with
a
foreign,
and
French
with
a
perfectly
pure,
accent;
and
that
his
dark,
thin
face,
with
its
fine
though
rather
wasted
lines,
had
a
most
anti
British
and
anti
Yorkshire
look.
These
points
seem
frivolous,
unlikely
to
influence
a
character
like
Yorke's;
but
the
fact
is
they
recalled
old,
perhaps
pleasurable,
associations
they
brought
back
his
travelling,
his
youthful
days.
He
had
seen,
amidst
Italian
cities
and
scenes,
faces
like
Moore's;
he
had
heard,
in
Parisian
cafes
and
theatres,
voices
like
his.
He
was
young
then,
and
when
he
looked
at
and
listened
to
the
alien,
he
seemed
young
again.
Secondly,
he
had
known
Moore's
father,
and
had
had
dealings
with
him.
That
was
a
more
substantial,
though
by
no
means
a
more
agreeable
tie;
for
as
his
firm
had
been
connected
with
Moore's
in
business,
it
had
also,
in
some
measure,
been
implicated
in
its
losses.
Thirdly,
he
had
found
Robert
himself
a
sharp
man
of
business.
He
saw
reason
to
anticipate
that
he
would,
in
the
end,
by
one
means
or
another,
make
money;
and
he
respected
both
his
resolution
and
acuteness
perhaps,
also,
his
hardness.
A
fourth
circumstance
which
drew
them
together
was
that
of
Mr.
Yorke
being
one
of
the
guardians
of
the
minor
on
whose
estate
Hollow's
Mill
was
situated;
consequently
Moore,
in
the
