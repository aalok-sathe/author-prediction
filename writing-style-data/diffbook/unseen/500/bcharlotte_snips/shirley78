Caroline's
elbow,
to
her
unmitigated
annoyance,
for
she
had
a
peculiar
antipathy
to
Donne,
on
account
of
his
stultified
and
immovable
self
conceit
and
his
incurable
narrowness
of
mind.
Malone,
grinning
most
unmeaningly,
inducted
himself
into
the
corresponding
seat
on
the
other
side.
She
was
thus
blessed
in
a
pair
of
supporters,
neither
of
whom,
she
knew,
would
be
of
any
mortal
use,
whether
for
keeping
up
the
conversation,
handing
cups,
circulating
the
muffins,
or
even
lifting
the
plate
from
the
slop
basin.
Little
Sweeting,
small
and
boyish
as
he
was,
would
have
been
worth
twenty
of
them.
Malone,
though
a
ceaseless
talker
when
there
were
only
men
present,
was
usually
tongue
tied
in
the
presence
of
ladies.
Three
phrases,
however,
he
had
ready
cut
and
dried,
which
he
never
failed
to
produce:
1stly.
"Have
you
had
a
walk
to
day,
Miss
Helstone?"
2ndly.
"Have
you
seen
your
cousin
Moore
lately?"
3rdly.
"Does
your
class
at
the
Sunday
school
keep
up
its
number?"
These
three
questions
being
put
and
responded
to,
between
Caroline
and
Malone
reigned
silence.
With
Donne
it
was
otherwise;
he
was
troublesome,
exasperating.
He
had
a
stock
of
small
talk
on
hand,
at
once
the
most
trite
and
perverse
that
can
well
be
imagined
abuse
of
the
people
of
Briarfield;
of
the
natives
of
Yorkshire
generally;
complaints
of
the
want
of
high
society;
of
the
backward
state
of
civilization
in
these
districts;
murmurings
against
the
disrespectful
conduct
of
the
lower
orders
in
the
north
toward
their
betters;
silly
ridicule
of
the
manner
of
living
in
these
parts
the
want
of
style,
the
absence
of
elegance,
as
if
he,
Donne,
had
been
accustomed
to
very
great
doings
indeed,
an
insinuation
which
his
somewhat
underbred
manner
and
aspect
failed
to
bear
out.
These
strictures,
he
seemed
to
think,
must
raise
him
in
the
estimation
of
Miss
Helstone
or
of
any
other
lady
who
heard
him;
whereas
with
her,
at
least,
they
brought
him
to
a
level
below
contempt,
though
sometimes,
indeed,
they
incensed
her;
for,
a
Yorkshire
girl
herself,
she
hated
to
hear
Yorkshire
abused
by
such
a
pitiful
prater;
and
when
wrought
up
to
a
certain
pitch,
she
would
turn
and
say
something
of
which
neither
the
matter
nor
the
manner
recommended
her
to
Mr.
Donne's
good
will.
She
would
tell
him
it
was
no
proof
of
refinement
to
be
ever
scolding
others
for
vulgarity,
and
no
sign
of
a
good
pastor
to
be
eternally
censuring
his
flock.
She
would
ask
him
what
he
had
entered
the
church
for,
since
he
complained
there
were
only
cottages
to
visit,
and
poor
people
to
preach
to
whether
he
had
been
ordained
to
the
ministry
merely
to
wear
soft
clothing
and
sit
in
king's
houses.
These
questions
were
considered
by
all
the
curates
as,
to
the
last
degree,
audacious
and
impious.
Tea
was
a
long
time
in
progress;
all
the
guests
gabbled
as
their
hostess
had
expected
they
would.
Mr.
Helstone,
being
in
excellent
spirits
when,
indeed,
was
he
ever
otherwise
