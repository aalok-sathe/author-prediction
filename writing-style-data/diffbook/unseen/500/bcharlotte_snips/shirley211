a
smile,
half
corrective,
half
grateful.
The
slightest
possible
shake
of
the
head
delicately
marked
the
former
quality;
it
is
probable
a
gentle
pressure
indicated
the
latter.
"You
may
sit
where
you
can
now,
Mr.
Moore,"
said
Shirley,
also
smiling.
"You
see
there
is
not
an
inch
of
room
for
you
here;
but
I
discern
plenty
of
space
at
Mrs.
Boultby's
table,
between
Miss
Armitage
and
Miss
Birtwhistle.
Go!
John
Sykes
will
be
your
vis
a
vis,
and
you
will
sit
with
your
back
towards
us."
Moore,
however,
preferred
lingering
about
where
he
was.
He
now
and
then
took
a
turn
down
the
long
room,
pausing
in
his
walk
to
interchange
greetings
with
other
gentlemen
in
his
own
placeless
predicament;
but
still
he
came
back
to
the
magnet,
Shirley,
bringing
with
him,
each
time
he
returned,
observations
it
was
necessary
to
whisper
in
her
ear.
Meantime
poor
Sam
Wynne
looked
far
from
comfortable.
His
fair
neighbour,
judging
from
her
movements,
appeared
in
a
mood
the
most
unquiet
and
unaccommodating.
She
would
not
sit
still
two
seconds.
She
was
hot;
she
fanned
herself;
complained
of
want
of
air
and
space.
She
remarked
that,
in
her
opinion,
when
people
had
finished
their
tea
they
ought
to
leave
the
tables,
and
announced
distinctly
that
she
expected
to
faint
if
the
present
state
of
things
continued.
Mr.
Sam
offered
to
accompany
her
into
the
open
air;
just
the
way
to
give
her
her
death
of
cold,
she
alleged.
In
short,
his
post
became
untenable;
and
having
swallowed
his
quantum
of
tea,
he
judged
it
expedient
to
evacuate.
Moore
should
have
been
at
hand,
whereas
he
was
quite
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
room,
deep
in
conference
with
Christopher
Sykes.
A
large
corn
factor,
Timothy
Ramsden,
Esq.,
happened
to
be
nearer;
and
feeling
himself
tired
of
standing,
he
advanced
to
fill
the
vacant
seat.
Shirley's
expedients
did
not
fail
her.
A
sweep
of
her
scarf
upset
her
teacup:
its
contents
were
shared
between
the
bench
and
her
own
satin
dress.
Of
course,
it
became
necessary
to
call
a
waiter
to
remedy
the
mischief.
Mr.
Ramsden,
a
stout,
puffy
gentleman,
as
large
in
person
as
he
was
in
property,
held
aloof
from
the
consequent
commotion.
Shirley,
usually
almost
culpably
indifferent
to
slight
accidents
affecting
dress,
etc.,
now
made
a
commotion
that
might
have
become
the
most
delicate
and
nervous
of
her
sex.
Mr.
Ramsden
opened
his
mouth,
withdrew
slowly,
and,
as
Miss
Keeldar
again
intimated
her
intention
to
"give
way"
and
swoon
on
the
spot,
he
turned
on
his
heel,
and
beat
a
heavy
retreat.
Moore
at
last
returned.
Calmly
surveying
the
bustle,
and
somewhat
quizzically
scanning
Shirley's
enigmatical
looking
countenance,
he
remarked
that
in
truth
this
was
the
hottest
end
of
the
room,
that
he
found
a
climate
there
calculated
to
agree
with
none
but
cool
temperaments
like
his
own;
and
putting
the
waiters,
the
napkins,
the
satin
robe
the
whole
turmoil,
in
short
to
one
side,
he
installed
himself
where
destiny
evidently
decreed
