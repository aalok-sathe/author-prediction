sprang
Saturn,
Hyperion,
Oceanus;
she
bore
Prometheus
"
"Pagan
that
you
are!
what
does
that
signify?"
"I
say,
there
were
giants
on
the
earth
in
those
days
giants
that
strove
to
scale
heaven.
The
first
woman's
breast
that
heaved
with
life
on
this
world
yielded
the
daring
which
could
contend
with
Omnipotence,
the
strength
which
could
bear
a
thousand
years
of
bondage,
the
vitality
which
could
feed
that
vulture
death
through
uncounted
ages,
the
unexhausted
life
and
uncorrupted
excellence,
sisters
to
immortality,
which,
after
millenniums
of
crimes,
struggles,
and
woes,
could
conceive
and
bring
forth
a
Messiah.
The
first
woman
was
heaven
born.
Vast
was
the
heart
whence
gushed
the
well
spring
of
the
blood
of
nations,
and
grand
the
undegenerate
head
where
rested
the
consort
crown
of
creation."
"She
coveted
an
apple,
and
was
cheated
by
a
snake;
but
you
have
got
such
a
hash
of
Scripture
and
mythology
into
your
head
that
there
is
no
making
any
sense
of
you.
You
have
not
yet
told
me
what
you
saw
kneeling
on
those
hills."
"I
saw
I
now
see
a
woman
Titan.
Her
robe
of
blue
air
spreads
to
the
outskirts
of
the
heath,
where
yonder
flock
is
grazing;
a
veil
white
as
an
avalanche
sweeps
from
her
head
to
her
feet,
and
arabesques
of
lightning
flame
on
its
borders.
Under
her
breast
I
see
her
zone,
purple
like
that
horizon;
through
its
blush
shines
the
star
of
evening.
Her
steady
eyes
I
cannot
picture.
They
are
clear,
they
are
deep
as
lakes,
they
are
lifted
and
full
of
worship,
they
tremble
with
the
softness
of
love
and
the
lustre
of
prayer.
Her
forehead
has
the
expanse
of
a
cloud,
and
is
paler
than
the
early
moon,
risen
long
before
dark
gathers.
She
reclines
her
bosom
on
the
ridge
of
Stilbro'
Moor;
her
mighty
hands
are
joined
beneath
it.
So
kneeling,
face
to
face
she
speaks
with
God.
That
Eve
is
Jehovah's
daughter,
as
Adam
was
His
son."
"She
is
very
vague
and
visionary.
Come,
Shirley,
we
ought
to
go
into
church."
"Caroline,
I
will
not;
I
will
stay
out
here
with
my
mother
Eve,
in
these
days
called
Nature.
I
love
her
undying,
mighty
being!
Heaven
may
have
faded
from
her
brow
when
she
fell
in
paradise,
but
all
that
is
glorious
on
earth
shines
there
still.
She
is
taking
me
to
her
bosom,
and
showing
me
her
heart.
Hush,
Caroline!
You
will
see
her
and
feel
as
I
do,
if
we
are
both
silent."
"I
will
humour
your
whim;
but
you
will
begin
talking
again
ere
ten
minutes
are
over."
Miss
Keeldar,
on
whom
the
soft
excitement
of
the
warm
summer
evening
seemed
working
with
unwonted
power,
leaned
against
an
upright
headstone;
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
deep
burning
west,
and
sank
into
a
pleasurable
trance.
Caroline,
going
a
little
apart,
paced
to
and
fro
beneath
the
rectory
garden
wall,
dreaming
too
in
her
way.
Shirley
had
mentioned
the
word
"mother."
That
word
suggested
to
