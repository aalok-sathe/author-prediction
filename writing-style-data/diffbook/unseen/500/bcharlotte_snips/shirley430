paramount
character.
In
all
this
Miss
Keeldar
partly
yielded
to
her
disposition;
but
a
remark
she
made
a
year
afterwards
proved
that
she
partly
also
acted
on
system.
"Louis,"
she
said,
"would
never
have
learned
to
rule
if
she
had
not
ceased
to
govern.
The
incapacity
of
the
sovereign
had
developed
the
powers
of
the
premier."
It
had
been
intended
that
Miss
Helstone
should
act
as
bridesmaid
at
the
approaching
nuptials,
but
Fortune
had
destined
her
another
part.
She
came
home
in
time
to
water
her
plants.
She
had
performed
this
little
task.
The
last
flower
attended
to
was
a
rose
tree,
which
bloomed
in
a
quiet
green
nook
at
the
back
of
the
house.
This
plant
had
received
the
refreshing
shower;
she
was
now
resting
a
minute.
Near
the
wall
stood
a
fragment
of
sculptured
stone
a
monkish
relic
once,
perhaps,
the
base
of
a
cross.
She
mounted
it,
that
she
might
better
command
the
view.
She
had
still
the
watering
pot
in
one
hand;
with
the
other
her
pretty
dress
was
held
lightly
aside,
to
avoid
trickling
drops.
She
gazed
over
the
wall,
along
some
lonely
fields;
beyond
three
dusk
trees,
rising
side
by
side
against
the
sky;
beyond
a
solitary
thorn
at
the
head
of
a
solitary
lane
far
off.
She
surveyed
the
dusk
moors,
where
bonfires
were
kindling.
The
summer
evening
was
warm;
the
bell
music
was
joyous;
the
blue
smoke
of
the
fires
looked
soft,
their
red
flame
bright.
Above
them,
in
the
sky
whence
the
sun
had
vanished,
twinkled
a
silver
point
the
star
of
love.
Caroline
was
not
unhappy
that
evening
far
otherwise;
but
as
she
gazed
she
sighed,
and
as
she
sighed
a
hand
circled
her,
and
rested
quietly
on
her
waist.
Caroline
thought
she
knew
who
had
drawn
near;
she
received
the
touch
unstartled.
"I
am
looking
at
Venus,
mamma.
See,
she
is
beautiful.
How
white
her
lustre
is,
compared
with
the
deep
red
of
the
bonfires!"
The
answer
was
a
closer
caress;
and
Caroline
turned,
and
looked,
not
into
Mrs.
Pryor's
matron
face,
but
up
at
a
dark
manly
visage.
She
dropped
her
watering
pot
and
stepped
down
from
the
pedestal.
"I
have
been
sitting
with
'mamma'
an
hour,"
said
the
intruder.
"I
have
had
a
long
conversation
with
her.
Where,
meantime,
have
you
been?"
"To
Fieldhead.
Shirley
is
as
naughty
as
ever,
Robert.
She
will
neither
say
Yes
nor
No
to
any
question
put.
She
sits
alone.
I
cannot
tell
whether
she
is
melancholy
or
nonchalant.
If
you
rouse
her
or
scold
her,
she
gives
you
a
look,
half
wistful,
half
reckless,
which
sends
you
away
as
queer
and
crazed
as
herself.
What
Louis
will
make
of
her,
I
cannot
tell.
For
my
part,
if
I
were
a
gentleman,
I
think
I
would
not
dare
undertake
her."
"Never
mind
them.
They
were
cut
out
for
each
other.
Louis,
strange
to
say,
likes
her
all
the
better
for
these
freaks.
He
will
manage
her,
if
any
one
can.
She
tries
