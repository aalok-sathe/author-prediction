well.
She
has
sat
near
me,
and
I
have
not
shaken
more
than
my
desk.
I
have
encountered
her
looks
and
smiles
like
why,
like
a
tutor,
as
I
am.
Her
hand
I
never
yet
touched
never
underwent
that
test.
Her
farmer
or
her
footman
I
am
not
no
serf
nor
servant
of
hers
have
I
ever
been;
but
I
am
poor,
and
it
behoves
me
to
look
to
my
self
respect
not
to
compromise
an
inch
of
it.
What
did
she
mean
by
that
allusion
to
the
cold
people
who
petrify
flesh
to
marble?
It
pleased
me
I
hardly
know
why;
I
would
not
permit
myself
to
inquire.
I
never
do
indulge
in
scrutiny
either
of
her
language
or
countenance;
for
if
I
did,
I
should
sometimes
forget
common
sense
and
believe
in
romance.
A
strange,
secret
ecstasy
steals
through
my
veins
at
moments.
I'll
not
encourage
I'll
not
remember
it.
I
am
resolved,
as
long
as
may
be,
to
retain
the
right
to
say
with
Paul,
'I
am
not
mad,
but
speak
forth
the
words
of
truth
and
soberness.'"
He
paused,
listening.
"Will
she
come,
or
will
she
not
come?"
he
inquired.
"How
will
she
take
the
message?
Naively
or
disdainfully?
Like
a
child
or
like
a
queen?
Both
characters
are
in
her
nature.
"If
she
comes,
what
shall
I
say
to
her?
How
account,
firstly,
for
the
freedom
of
the
request?
Shall
I
apologize
to
her?
I
could
in
all
humility;
but
would
an
apology
tend
to
place
us
in
the
positions
we
ought
relatively
to
occupy
in
this
matter?
I
must
keep
up
the
professor,
otherwise
I
hear
a
door."
He
waited.
Many
minutes
passed.
"She
will
refuse
me.
Henry
is
entreating
her
to
come;
she
declines.
My
petition
is
presumption
in
her
eyes.
Let
her
only
come,
I
can
teach
her
to
the
contrary.
I
would
rather
she
were
a
little
perverse;
it
will
steel
me.
I
prefer
her
cuirassed
in
pride,
armed
with
a
taunt.
Her
scorn
startles
me
from
my
dreams;
I
stand
up
myself.
A
sarcasm
from
her
eyes
or
lips
puts
strength
into
every
nerve
and
sinew
I
have.
Some
step
approaches,
and
not
Henry's."
The
door
unclosed;
Miss
Keeldar
came
in.
The
message,
it
appeared,
had
found
her
at
her
needle;
she
brought
her
work
in
her
hand.
That
day
she
had
not
been
riding
out;
she
had
evidently
passed
it
quietly.
She
wore
her
neat
indoor
dress
and
silk
apron.
This
was
no
Thalestris
from
the
fields,
but
a
quiet
domestic
character
from
the
fireside.
Mr.
Moore
had
her
at
advantage.
He
should
have
addressed
her
at
once
in
solemn
accents,
and
with
rigid
mien.
Perhaps
he
would,
had
she
looked
saucy;
but
her
air
never
showed
less
of
cranerie.
A
soft
kind
of
youthful
shyness
depressed
her
eyelid
and
mantled
on
her
cheek.
The
tutor
stood
silent.
She
made
a
full
stop
between
the
door
and
his
desk.
"Did
you
want
me,
sir?"
she
asked.
"I
ventured,
Miss
