Such
was
the
bridal
hour
of
Genius
and
Humanity.
Who
shall
rehearse
the
tale
of
their
after
union?
Who
shall
depict
its
bliss
and
bale?
Who
shall
tell
how
He
between
whom
and
the
Woman
God
put
enmity
forged
deadly
plots
to
break
the
bond
or
defile
its
purity?
Who
shall
record
the
long
strife
between
Serpent
and
Seraph:
How
still
the
Father
of
Lies
insinuated
evil
into
good,
pride
into
wisdom,
grossness
into
glory,
pain
into
bliss,
poison
into
passion?
How
the
"dreadless
Angel"
defied,
resisted,
and
repelled?
How
again
and
again
he
refined
the
polluted
cup,
exalted
the
debased
emotion,
rectified
the
perverted
impulse,
detected
the
lurking
venom,
baffled
the
frontless
temptation
purified,
justified,
watched,
and
withstood?
How,
by
his
patience,
by
his
strength,
by
that
unutterable
excellence
he
held
from
God
his
Origin
this
faithful
Seraph
fought
for
Humanity
a
good
fight
through
time;
and,
when
Time's
course
closed,
and
Death
was
encountered
at
the
end,
barring
with
fleshless
arm
the
portals
of
Eternity,
how
Genius
still
held
close
his
dying
bride,
sustained
her
through
the
agony
of
the
passage,
bore
her
triumphant
into
his
own
home,
Heaven;
restored
her,
redeemed,
to
Jehovah,
her
Maker;
and
at
last,
before
Angel
and
Archangel,
crowned
her
with
the
crown
of
Immortality?
Who
shall
of
these
things
write
the
chronicle?
"I
never
could
correct
that
composition,"
observed
Shirley,
as
Moore
concluded.
"Your
censor
pencil
scored
it
with
condemnatory
lines,
whose
signification
I
strove
vainly
to
fathom."
She
had
taken
a
crayon
from
the
tutor's
desk,
and
was
drawing
little
leaves,
fragments
of
pillars,
broken
crosses,
on
the
margin
of
the
book.
"French
may
be
half
forgotten,
but
the
habits
of
the
French
lesson
are
retained,
I
see,"
said
Louis.
"My
books
would
now,
as
erst,
be
unsafe
with
you.
My
newly
bound
St.
Pierre
would
soon
be
like
my
Racine
Miss
Keeldar,
her
mark,
traced
on
every
page."
Shirley
dropped
her
crayon
as
if
it
burned
her
fingers.
"Tell
me
what
were
the
faults
of
that
devoir?"
she
asked.
"Were
they
grammatical
errors,
or
did
you
object
to
the
substance?"
"I
never
said
that
the
lines
I
drew
were
indications
of
faults
at
all.
You
would
have
it
that
such
was
the
case,
and
I
refrained
from
contradiction."
"What
else
did
they
denote?"
"No
matter
now."
"Mr.
Moore,"
cried
Henry,
"make
Shirley
repeat
some
of
the
pieces
she
used
to
say
so
well
by
heart."
"If
I
ask
for
any,
it
will
be
'Le
Cheval
Dompte,'"
said
Moore,
trimming
with
his
penknife
the
pencil
Miss
Keeldar
had
worn
to
a
stump.
She
turned
aside
her
head;
the
neck,
the
clear
cheek,
forsaken
by
their
natural
veil,
were
seen
to
flush
warm.
"Ah!
she
has
not
forgotten,
you
see,
sir,"
said
Henry,
exultant.
"She
knows
how
naughty
she
was."
A
smile,
which
Shirley
would
not
permit
to
expand,
made
her
lip
tremble;
she
bent
her
face,
and
hid
it
half
with
her
arms,
half
in
her
curls,
which,
as
she
stooped,
