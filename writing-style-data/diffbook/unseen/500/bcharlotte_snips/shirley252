parish
planned
and
persevered
in
by
your
predecessor.
I
wonder
people
cannot
judge
more
fairly
of
each
other
and
themselves.
When
I
hear
Messrs.
Malone
and
Donne
chatter
about
the
authority
of
the
church,
the
dignity
and
claims
of
the
priesthood,
the
deference
due
to
them
as
clergymen;
when
I
hear
the
outbreaks
of
their
small
spite
against
Dissenters;
when
I
witness
their
silly,
narrow
jealousies
and
assumptions;
when
their
palaver
about
forms,
and
traditions,
and
superstitions
is
sounding
in
my
ear;
when
I
behold
their
insolent
carriage
to
the
poor,
their
often
base
servility
to
the
rich
I
think
the
Establishment
is
indeed
in
a
poor
way,
and
both
she
and
her
sons
appear
in
the
utmost
need
of
reformation.
Turning
away
distressed
from
minster
tower
and
village
spire
ay,
as
distressed
as
a
churchwarden
who
feels
the
exigence
of
white
wash
and
has
not
wherewithal
to
purchase
lime
I
recall
your
senseless
sarcasms
on
the
'fat
bishops,'
the
'pampered
parsons,'
'old
mother
church,'
etc.
I
remember
your
strictures
on
all
who
differ
from
you,
your
sweeping
condemnation
of
classes
and
individuals,
without
the
slightest
allowance
made
for
circumstances
or
temptations;
and
then,
Mr.
Yorke,
doubt
clutches
my
inmost
heart
as
to
whether
men
exist
clement,
reasonable,
and
just
enough
to
be
entrusted
with
the
task
of
reform.
I
don't
believe
you
are
of
the
number."
"You
have
an
ill
opinion
of
me,
Miss
Shirley.
You
never
told
me
so
much
of
your
mind
before."
"I
never
had
an
opening.
But
I
have
sat
on
Jessy's
stool
by
your
chair
in
the
back
parlour
at
Briarmains,
for
evenings
together,
listening
excitedly
to
your
talk,
half
admiring
what
you
said,
and
half
rebelling
against
it.
I
think
you
a
fine
old
Yorkshireman,
sir.
I
am
proud
to
have
been
born
in
the
same
county
and
parish
as
yourself.
Truthful,
upright,
independent
you
are,
as
a
rock
based
below
seas;
but
also
you
are
harsh,
rude,
narrow,
and
merciless."
"Not
to
the
poor,
lass,
nor
to
the
meek
of
the
earth;
only
to
the
proud
and
high
minded."
"And
what
right
have
you,
sir,
to
make
such
distinctions?
A
prouder,
a
higher
minded
man
than
yourself
does
not
exist.
You
find
it
easy
to
speak
comfortably
to
your
inferiors;
you
are
too
haughty,
too
ambitious,
too
jealous
to
be
civil
to
those
above
you.
But
you
are
all
alike.
Helstone
also
is
proud
and
prejudiced.
Moore,
though
juster
and
more
considerate
than
either
you
or
the
rector,
is
still
haughty,
stern,
and,
in
a
public
sense,
selfish.
It
is
well
there
are
such
men
as
Mr.
Hall
to
be
found
occasionally
men
of
large
and
kind
hearts,
who
can
love
their
whole
race,
who
can
forgive
others
for
being
richer,
more
prosperous,
or
more
powerful
than
they
are.
Such
men
may
have
less
originality,
less
force
of
character
than
you,
but
they
are
better
friends
to
mankind."
"And
when
is
it
to
be?"
said
Mr.
Yorke,
now
rising.
"When
is
what
