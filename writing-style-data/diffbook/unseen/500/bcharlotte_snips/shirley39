grand
folk
fro'
London
is
shocked
at
wer
'incivility;'
and
we
like
weel
enough
to
gi'e
'em
summat
to
be
shocked
at,
'cause
it's
sport
to
us
to
watch
'em
turn
up
the
whites
o'
their
een,
and
spreed
out
their
bits
o'
hands,
like
as
they're
flayed
wi'
bogards,
and
then
to
hear
'em
say,
nipping
off
their
words
short
like,
'Dear!
dear!
Whet
seveges!
How
very
corse!'"
"You
are
savages,
Joe.
You
don't
suppose
you're
civilized,
do
you?"
"Middling,
middling,
maister.
I
reckon
'at
us
manufacturing
lads
i'
th'
north
is
a
deal
more
intelligent,
and
knaws
a
deal
more
nor
th'
farming
folk
i'
th'
south.
Trade
sharpens
wer
wits;
and
them
that's
mechanics
like
me
is
forced
to
think.
Ye
know,
what
wi'
looking
after
machinery
and
sich
like,
I've
getten
into
that
way
that
when
I
see
an
effect,
I
look
straight
out
for
a
cause,
and
I
oft
lig
hold
on't
to
purpose;
and
then
I
like
reading,
and
I'm
curious
to
knaw
what
them
that
reckons
to
govern
us
aims
to
do
for
us
and
wi'
us.
And
there's
many
'cuter
nor
me;
there's
many
a
one
amang
them
greasy
chaps
'at
smells
o'
oil,
and
amang
them
dyers
wi'
blue
and
black
skins,
that
has
a
long
head,
and
that
can
tell
what
a
fooil
of
a
law
is,
as
well
as
ye
or
old
Yorke,
and
a
deal
better
nor
soft
uns
like
Christopher
Sykes
o'
Whinbury,
and
greet
hectoring
nowts
like
yond'
Irish
Peter,
Helstone's
curate."
"You
think
yourself
a
clever
fellow,
I
know,
Scott."
"Ay!
I'm
fairish.
I
can
tell
cheese
fro'
chalk,
and
I'm
varry
weel
aware
that
I've
improved
sich
opportunities
as
I
have
had,
a
deal
better
nor
some
'at
reckons
to
be
aboon
me;
but
there's
thousands
i'
Yorkshire
that's
as
good
as
me,
and
a
two
three
that's
better."
"You're
a
great
man
you're
a
sublime
fellow;
but
you're
a
prig,
a
conceited
noodle
with
it
all,
Joe!
You
need
not
to
think
that
because
you've
picked
up
a
little
knowledge
of
practical
mathematics,
and
because
you
have
found
some
scantling
of
the
elements
of
chemistry
at
the
bottom
of
a
dyeing
vat,
that
therefore
you're
a
neglected
man
of
science;
and
you
need
not
to
suppose
that
because
the
course
of
trade
does
not
always
run
smooth,
and
you,
and
such
as
you,
are
sometimes
short
of
work
and
of
bread,
that
therefore
your
class
are
martyrs,
and
that
the
whole
form
of
government
under
which
you
live
is
wrong.
And,
moreover,
you
need
not
for
a
moment
to
insinuate
that
the
virtues
have
taken
refuge
in
cottages
and
wholly
abandoned
slated
houses.
Let
me
tell
you,
I
particularly
abominate
that
sort
of
trash,
because
I
know
so
well
that
human
nature
is
human
nature
everywhere,
whether
under
tile
or
thatch,
and
that
in
every
specimen
of
human
nature
that
breathes,
vice
and
virtue
are
ever
found
blended,
in
smaller
or
greater
proportions,
