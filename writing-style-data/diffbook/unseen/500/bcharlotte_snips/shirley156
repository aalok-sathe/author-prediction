and
sets
the
face
on
fire
to
think
of;
one
of
those
small
but
sharp
recollections
that
return,
lacerating
your
self
respect
like
tiny
penknives,
and
forcing
from
your
lips,
as
you
sit
alone,
sudden,
insane
sounding
interjections."
"Caroline!"
"I
do
think
myself
a
fool,
Shirley,
in
some
respects;
I
do
despise
myself.
But
I
said
I
would
not
make
you
my
confessor,
for
you
cannot
reciprocate
foible
for
foible;
you
are
not
weak.
How
steadily
you
watch
me
now!
Turn
aside
your
clear,
strong,
she
eagle
eye;
it
is
an
insult
to
fix
it
on
me
thus."
"What
a
study
of
character
you
are
weak,
certainly,
but
not
in
the
sense
you
think!
Come
in!"
This
was
said
in
answer
to
a
tap
at
the
door.
Miss
Keeldar
happened
to
be
near
it
at
the
moment,
Caroline
at
the
other
end
of
the
room.
She
saw
a
note
put
into
Shirley's
hands,
and
heard
the
words,
"From
Mr.
Moore,
ma'am."
"Bring
candles,"
said
Miss
Keeldar.
Caroline
sat
expectant.
"A
communication
on
business,"
said
the
heiress;
but
when
candles
were
brought,
she
neither
opened
nor
read
it.
The
rector's
Fanny
was
presently
announced,
and
the
rector's
niece
went
home.
In
Shirley's
nature
prevailed
at
times
an
easy
indolence.
There
were
periods
when
she
took
delight
in
perfect
vacancy
of
hand
and
eye
moments
when
her
thoughts,
her
simple
existence,
the
fact
of
the
world
being
around
and
heaven
above
her,
seemed
to
yield
her
such
fullness
of
happiness
that
she
did
not
need
to
lift
a
finger
to
increase
the
joy.
Often,
after
an
active
morning,
she
would
spend
a
sunny
afternoon
in
lying
stirless
on
the
turf,
at
the
foot
of
some
tree
of
friendly
umbrage.
No
society
did
she
need
but
that
of
Caroline,
and
it
sufficed
if
she
were
within
call;
no
spectacle
did
she
ask
but
that
of
the
deep
blue
sky,
and
such
cloudlets
as
sailed
afar
and
aloft
across
its
span;
no
sound
but
that
of
the
bee's
hum,
the
leaf's
whisper.
Her
sole
book
in
such
hours
was
the
dim
chronicle
of
memory
or
the
sibyl
page
of
anticipation.
From
her
young
eyes
fell
on
each
volume
a
glorious
light
to
read
by;
round
her
lips
at
moments
played
a
smile
which
revealed
glimpses
of
the
tale
or
prophecy.
It
was
not
sad,
not
dark.
Fate
had
been
benign
to
the
blissful
dreamer,
and
promised
to
favour
her
yet
again.
In
her
past
were
sweet
passages,
in
her
future
rosy
hopes.
Yet
one
day
when
Caroline
drew
near
to
rouse
her,
thinking
she
had
lain
long
enough,
behold,
as
she
looked
down,
Shirley's
cheek
was
wet
as
if
with
dew;
those
fine
eyes
of
hers
shone
humid
and
brimming.
"Shirley,
why
do
you
cry?"
asked
Caroline,
involuntarily
laying
stress
on
you.
Miss
Keeldar
smiled,
and
turned
her
picturesque
head
towards
the
questioner.
"Because
it
pleases
me
mightily
to
cry,"
she
said.
"My
heart
is
both
sad
and
glad.
But
why,
you
good,
patient
