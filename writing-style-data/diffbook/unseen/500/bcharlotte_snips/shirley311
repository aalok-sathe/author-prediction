Miss
Keeldar
even
this
negative
excuse
for
her
prejudice.
One
day
she
chanced
to
be
in
the
schoolroom
with
Henry
Sympson,
whose
amiable
and
affectionate
disposition
had
quickly
recommended
him
to
her
regard.
The
boy
was
busied
about
some
mechanical
contrivance;
his
lameness
made
him
fond
of
sedentary
occupation.
He
began
to
ransack
his
tutor's
desk
for
a
piece
of
wax
or
twine
necessary
to
his
work.
Moore
happened
to
be
absent.
Mr.
Hall,
indeed,
had
called
for
him
to
take
a
long
walk.
Henry
could
not
immediately
find
the
object
of
his
search.
He
rummaged
compartment
after
compartment;
and
at
last,
opening
an
inner
drawer,
he
came
upon
not
a
ball
of
cord
or
a
lump
of
beeswax,
but
a
little
bundle
of
small
marble
coloured
cahiers,
tied
with
tape.
Henry
looked
at
them.
"What
rubbish
Mr.
Moore
stores
up
in
his
desk!"
he
said.
"I
hope
he
won't
keep
my
old
exercises
so
carefully."
"What
is
it?"
"Old
copy
books."
He
threw
the
bundle
to
Caroline.
The
packet
looked
so
neat
externally
her
curiosity
was
excited
to
see
its
contents.
"If
they
are
only
copy
books,
I
suppose
I
may
open
them?"
"Oh
yes,
quite
freely.
Mr.
Moore's
desk
is
half
mine
for
he
lets
me
keep
all
sorts
of
things
in
it
and
I
give
you
leave."
On
scrutiny
they
proved
to
be
French
compositions,
written
in
a
hand
peculiar
but
compact,
and
exquisitely
clean
and
clear.
The
writing
was
recognizable.
She
scarcely
needed
the
further
evidence
of
the
name
signed
at
the
close
of
each
theme
to
tell
her
whose
they
were.
Yet
that
name
astonished
her
"Shirley
Keeldar,
Sympson
Grove,
shire"
(a
southern
county),
and
a
date
four
years
back.
She
tied
up
the
packet,
and
held
it
in
her
hand,
meditating
over
it.
She
half
felt
as
if,
in
opening
it,
she
had
violated
a
confidence.
"They
are
Shirley's,
you
see,"
said
Henry
carelessly.
"Did
you
give
them
to
Mr.
Moore?
She
wrote
them
with
Mrs.
Pryor,
I
suppose?"
"She
wrote
them
in
my
schoolroom
at
Sympson
Grove,
when
she
lived
with
us
there.
Mr.
Moore
taught
her
French;
it
is
his
native
language."
"I
know.
Was
she
a
good
pupil,
Henry?"
"She
was
a
wild,
laughing
thing,
but
pleasant
to
have
in
the
room.
She
made
lesson
time
charming.
She
learned
fast
you
could
hardly
tell
when
or
how.
French
was
nothing
to
her.
She
spoke
it
quick,
quick
as
quick
as
Mr.
Moore
himself."
"Was
she
obedient?
Did
she
give
trouble?"
"She
gave
plenty
of
trouble,
in
a
way.
She
was
giddy,
but
I
liked
her.
I'm
desperately
fond
of
Shirley."
"Desperately
fond
you
small
simpleton!
You
don't
know
what
you
say."
"I
am
desperately
fond
of
her.
She
is
the
light
of
my
eyes.
I
said
so
to
Mr.
Moore
last
night."
"He
would
reprove
you
for
speaking
with
exaggeration."
"He
didn't.
He
never
reproves
and
reproves,
as
girls'
governesses
do.
He
was
reading,
and
he
only
smiled
into
his
book,
