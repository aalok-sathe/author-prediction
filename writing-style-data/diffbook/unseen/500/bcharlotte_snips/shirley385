liked
to
feel
himself
of
use.
"Martin,
before
we
separate,
assure
me
seriously,
and
on
your
word
of
honour,
that
Mr.
Moore
is
better."
"How
very
much
you
think
of
that
Moore!"
"No
but
many
of
his
friends
may
ask
me,
and
I
wish
to
be
able
to
give
an
authentic
answer."
"You
may
tell
them
he
is
well
enough,
only
idle.
You
may
tell
them
that
he
takes
mutton
chops
for
dinner,
and
the
best
of
arrowroot
for
supper.
I
intercepted
a
basin
myself
one
night
on
its
way
upstairs,
and
ate
half
of
it."
"And
who
waits
on
him,
Martin?
who
nurses
him?"
"Nurses
him?
The
great
baby!
Why,
a
woman
as
round
and
big
as
our
largest
water
butt
a
rough,
hard
favoured
old
girl.
I
make
no
doubt
she
leads
him
a
rich
life.
Nobody
else
is
let
near
him.
He
is
chiefly
in
the
dark.
It
is
my
belief
she
knocks
him
about
terribly
in
that
chamber.
I
listen
at
the
wall
sometimes
when
I
am
in
bed,
and
I
think
I
hear
her
thumping
him.
You
should
see
her
fist.
She
could
hold
half
a
dozen
hands
like
yours
in
her
one
palm.
After
all,
notwithstanding
the
chops
and
jellies
he
gets,
I
would
not
be
in
his
shoes.
In
fact,
it
is
my
private
opinion
that
she
eats
most
of
what
goes
up
on
the
tray
to
Mr.
Moore.
I
wish
she
may
not
be
starving
him."
Profound
silence
and
meditation
on
Caroline's
part,
and
a
sly
watchfulness
on
Martin's.
"You
never
see
him,
I
suppose,
Martin?"
"I?
No.
I
don't
care
to
see
him,
for
my
own
part."
Silence
again.
"Did
not
you
come
to
our
house
once
with
Mrs.
Pryor,
about
five
weeks
since,
to
ask
after
him?"
again
inquired
Martin.
"Yes."
"I
dare
say
you
wished
to
be
shown
upstairs?"
"We
did
wish
it.
We
entreated
it;
but
your
mother
declined."
"Ay!
she
declined.
I
heard
it
all.
She
treated
you
as
it
is
her
pleasure
to
treat
visitors
now
and
then.
She
behaved
to
you
rudely
and
harshly."
"She
was
not
kind;
for
you
know,
Martin,
we
are
relations,
and
it
is
natural
we
should
take
an
interest
in
Mr.
Moore.
But
here
we
must
part;
we
are
at
your
father's
gate."
"Very
well,
what
of
that?
I
shall
walk
home
with
you."
"They
will
miss
you,
and
wonder
where
you
are."
"Let
them.
I
can
take
care
of
myself,
I
suppose."
Martin
knew
that
he
had
already
incurred
the
penalty
of
a
lecture,
and
dry
bread
for
his
tea.
No
matter;
the
evening
had
furnished
him
with
an
adventure.
It
was
better
than
muffins
and
toast.
He
walked
home
with
Caroline.
On
the
way
he
promised
to
see
Mr.
Moore,
in
spite
of
the
dragon
who
guarded
his
chamber,
and
appointed
an
hour
on
the
next
day
when
Caroline
was
to
come
to
Briarmains
Wood
and
get
tidings
of
him.
He
would
meet
her
at
a
certain
tree.
