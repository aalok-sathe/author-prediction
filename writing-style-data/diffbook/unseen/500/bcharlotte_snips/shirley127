Christ
than
that
of
any
other
human
being
he
had
ever
met
with.
You
must
not
think,
reader,
that
ill
sketching
Miss
Ainley's
character
I
depict
a
figment
of
imagination.
No.
We
seek
the
originals
of
such
portraits
in
real
life
only.
Miss
Helstone
studied
well
the
mind
and
heart
now
revealed
to
her.
She
found
no
high
intellect
to
admire
the
old
maid
was
merely
sensible
but
she
discovered
so
much
goodness,
so
much
usefulness,
so
much
mildness,
patience,
truth,
that
she
bent
her
own
mind
before
Miss
Ainley's
in
reverence.
What
was
her
love
of
nature,
what
was
her
sense
of
beauty,
what
were
her
more
varied
and
fervent
emotions,
what
was
her
deeper
power
of
thought,
what
her
wider
capacity
to
comprehend,
compared
to
the
practical
excellence
of
this
good
woman?
Momently,
they
seemed
only
beautiful
forms
of
selfish
delight;
mentally,
she
trod
them
under
foot.
It
is
true
she
still
felt
with
pain
that
the
life
which
made
Miss
Ainley
happy
could
not
make
her
happy.
Pure
and
active
as
it
was,
in
her
heart
she
deemed
it
deeply
dreary,
because
it
was
so
loveless
to
her
ideas,
so
forlorn.
Yet,
doubtless,
she
reflected,
it
needed
only
habit
to
make
it
practicable
and
agreeable
to
any
one.
It
was
despicable,
she
felt,
to
pine
sentimentally,
to
cherish
secret
griefs,
vain
memories,
to
be
inert,
to
waste
youth
in
aching
languor,
to
grow
old
doing
nothing.
"I
will
bestir
myself,"
was
her
resolution,
"and
try
to
be
wise
if
I
cannot
be
good."
She
proceeded
to
make
inquiry
of
Miss
Ainley
if
she
could
help
her
in
anything.
Miss
Ainley,
glad
of
an
assistant,
told
her
that
she
could,
and
indicated
some
poor
families
in
Briarfield
that
it
was
desirable
she
should
visit,
giving
her
likewise,
at
her
further
request,
some
work
to
do
for
certain
poor
women
who
had
many
children,
and
who
were
unskilled
in
using
the
needle
for
themselves.
Caroline
went
home,
laid
her
plans,
and
took
a
resolve
not
to
swerve
from
them.
She
allotted
a
certain
portion
of
her
time
for
her
various
studies,
and
a
certain
portion
for
doing
anything
Miss
Ainley
might
direct
her
to
do.
The
remainder
was
to
be
spent
in
exercise;
not
a
moment
was
to
be
left
for
the
indulgence
of
such
fevered
thoughts
as
had
poisoned
last
Sunday
evening.
To
do
her
justice,
she
executed
her
plans
conscientiously,
perseveringly.
It
was
very
hard
work
at
first
it
was
even
hard
work
to
the
end
but
it
helped
her
to
stem
and
keep
down
anguish;
it
forced
her
to
be
employed;
it
forbade
her
to
brood;
and
gleams
of
satisfaction
chequered
her
gray
life
here
and
there
when
she
found
she
had
done
good,
imparted
pleasure,
or
allayed
suffering.
Yet
I
must
speak
truth.
These
efforts
brought
her
neither
health
of
body
nor
continued
peace
of
mind.
With
them
all
she
wasted,
grew
more
joyless
and
more
wan;
with
them
all
her
memory
kept
harping
on
