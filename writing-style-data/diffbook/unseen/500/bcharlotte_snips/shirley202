was
pragmatical
and
self
complacent,
from
his
turned
up
nose
and
elevated
chin
to
his
clerical
black
gaiters,
his
somewhat
short,
strapless
trousers,
and
his
square
toed
shoes.
Walk
on,
Mr.
Donne!
You
have
undergone
scrutiny.
You
think
you
look
well.
Whether
the
white
and
purple
figures
watching
you
from
yonder
hill
think
so
is
another
question.
These
figures
come
running
down
when
the
regiment
has
marched
by.
The
churchyard
is
full
of
children
and
teachers,
all
in
their
very
best
holiday
attire;
and,
distressed
as
is
the
district,
bad
as
are
the
times,
it
is
wonderful
to
see
how
respectably,
how
handsomely
even,
they
have
contrived
to
clothe
themselves.
That
British
love
of
decency
will
work
miracles.
The
poverty
which
reduces
an
Irish
girl
to
rags
is
impotent
to
rob
the
English
girl
of
the
neat
wardrobe
she
knows
necessary
to
her
self
respect.
Besides,
the
lady
of
the
manor
that
Shirley,
now
gazing
with
pleasure
on
this
well
dressed
and
happy
looking
crowd
has
really
done
them
good.
Her
seasonable
bounty
consoled
many
a
poor
family
against
the
coming
holiday,
and
supplied
many
a
child
with
a
new
frock
or
bonnet
for
the
occasion.
She
knows
it,
and
is
elate
with
the
consciousness
glad
that
her
money,
example,
and
influence
have
really,
substantially,
benefited
those
around
her.
She
cannot
be
charitable
like
Miss
Ainley:
it
is
not
in
her
nature.
It
relieves
her
to
feel
that
there
is
another
way
of
being
charitable,
practicable
for
other
characters,
and
under
other
circumstances.
Caroline,
too,
is
pleased,
for
she
also
has
done
good
in
her
small
way
robbed
herself
of
more
than
one
dress,
ribbon,
or
collar
she
could
ill
spare,
to
aid
in
fitting
out
the
scholars
of
her
class;
and
as
she
could
not
give
money,
she
has
followed
Miss
Ainley's
example
in
giving
her
time
and
her
industry
to
sew
for
the
children.
Not
only
is
the
churchyard
full,
but
the
rectory
garden
is
also
thronged.
Pairs
and
parties
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
are
seen
walking
amongst
the
waving
lilacs
and
laburnums.
The
house
also
is
occupied:
at
the
wide
open
parlour
windows
gay
groups
are
standing.
These
are
the
patrons
and
teachers,
who
are
to
swell
the
procession.
In
the
parson's
croft,
behind
the
rectory,
are
the
musicians
of
the
three
parish
bands,
with
their
instruments.
Fanny
and
Eliza,
in
the
smartest
of
caps
and
gowns,
and
the
whitest
of
aprons,
move
amongst
them,
serving
out
quarts
of
ale,
whereof
a
stock
was
brewed
very
sound
and
strong
some
weeks
since
by
the
rector's
orders,
and
under
his
special
superintendence.
Whatever
he
had
a
hand
in
must
be
managed
handsomely.
"Shabby
doings"
of
any
description
were
not
endured
under
his
sanction.
From
the
erection
of
a
public
building,
a
church,
school,
or
court
house,
to
the
cooking
of
a
dinner,
he
still
advocated
the
lordly,
liberal,
and
effective.
Miss
Keeldar
was
like
him
in
this
respect,
and
they
mutually
approved
each
other's
arrangements.

and
Shirley
