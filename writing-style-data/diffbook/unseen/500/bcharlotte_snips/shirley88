months
sin',
Murgatroyd
and
Moses
chanced
to
meet
one
Sunday
night;
they'd
both
come
lurking
about
these
premises
wi'
the
notion
of
counselling
Sarah
to
tak
a
bit
of
a
walk
wi'
them.
They
fell
out,
had
a
tussle,
and
Fred
was
worsted,
for
he's
young
and
small,
and
Barraclough,
for
all
he
has
only
one
leg,
is
almost
as
strong
as
Sugden
there
indeed,
anybody
that
hears
him
roaring
at
a
revival
or
a
love
feast
may
be
sure
he's
no
weakling."
"Joe,
you're
insupportable,"
here
broke
in
Mr.
Moore.
"You
spin
out
your
explanation
as
Moses
spins
out
his
sermons.
The
long
and
short
of
it
is,
Murgatroyd
was
jealous
of
Barraclough;
and
last
night,
as
he
and
a
friend
took
shelter
in
a
barn
from
a
shower,
they
heard
and
saw
Moses
conferring
with
some
associates
within.
From
their
discourse
it
was
plain
he
had
been
the
leader,
not
only
at
Stilbro'
Moor,
but
in
the
attack
on
Sykes's
property.
Moreover
they
planned
a
deputation
to
wait
on
me
this
morning,
which
the
tailor
is
to
head,
and
which,
in
the
most
religious
and
peaceful
spirit,
is
to
entreat
me
to
put
the
accursed
thing
out
of
my
tent.
I
rode
over
to
Whinbury
this
morning,
got
a
constable
and
a
warrant,
and
I
am
now
waiting
to
give
my
friend
the
reception
he
deserves.
Here,
meantime,
comes
Sykes.
Mr.
Helstone,
you
must
spirit
him
up.
He
feels
timid
at
the
thoughts
of
prosecuting."
A
gig
was
heard
to
roll
into
the
yard.
Mr.
Sykes
entered
a
tall
stout
man
of
about
fifty,
comely
of
feature,
but
feeble
of
physiognomy.
He
looked
anxious.
"Have
they
been?
Are
they
gone?
Have
you
got
him?
Is
it
over?"
he
asked.
"Not
yet,"
returned
Moore
with
phlegm.
"We
are
waiting
for
them."
"They'll
not
come;
it's
near
noon.
Better
give
it
up.
It
will
excite
bad
feeling
make
a
stir
cause
perhaps
fatal
consequences."
"You
need
not
appear,"
said
Moore.
"I
shall
meet
them
in
the
yard
when
they
come;
you
can
stay
here."
"But
my
name
must
be
seen
in
the
law
proceedings.
A
wife
and
family,
Mr.
Moore
a
wife
and
family
make
a
man
cautious."
Moore
looked
disgusted.
"Give
way,
if
you
please,"
said
he;
"leave
me
to
myself.
I
have
no
objection
to
act
alone;
only
be
assured
you
will
not
find
safety
in
submission.
Your
partner
Pearson
gave
way,
and
conceded,
and
forbore.
Well,
that
did
not
prevent
them
from
attempting
to
shoot
him
in
his
own
house."
"My
dear
sir,
take
a
little
wine
and
water,"
recommended
Mr.
Helstone.
The
wine
and
water
was
hollands
and
water,
as
Mr.
Sykes
discovered
when
he
had
compounded
and
swallowed
a
brimming
tumbler
thereof.
It
transfigured
him
in
two
minutes,
brought
the
colour
back
to
his
face,
and
made
him
at
least
word
valiant.
He
now
announced
that
he
hoped
he
was
above
being
trampled
on
by
the
common
people;
he
was
determined
to
endure
the
insolence
