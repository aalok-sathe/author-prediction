hovering
round
her
lips,
that
at
last
she
had
hit
on
a
topic
that
pleased.
Many
a
time
had
she
heard
the
fat
"Adonis
of
fifty"
discussed
at
her
father's
breakfast
table,
and
she
now
gave
Mr.
Yorke's
comments
on
the
theme
genuine
as
uttered
by
his
Yorkshire
lips.
But,
Jessie,
I
will
write
about
you
no
more.
This
is
an
autumn
evening,
wet
and
wild.
There
is
only
one
cloud
in
the
sky,
but
it
curtains
it
from
pole
to
pole.
The
wind
cannot
rest;
it
hurries
sobbing
over
hills
of
sullen
outline,
colourless
with
twilight
and
mist.
Rain
has
beat
all
day
on
that
church
tower.
It
rises
dark
from
the
stony
enclosure
of
its
graveyard.
The
nettles,
the
long
grass,
and
the
tombs
all
drip
with
wet.
This
evening
reminds
me
too
forcibly
of
another
evening
some
years
ago
a
howling,
rainy
autumn
evening
too
when
certain
who
had
that
day
performed
a
pilgrimage
to
a
grave
new
made
in
a
heretic
cemetery
sat
near
a
wood
fire
on
the
hearth
of
a
foreign
dwelling.
They
were
merry
and
social,
but
they
each
knew
that
a
gap,
never
to
be
filled,
had
been
made
in
their
circle.
They
knew
they
had
lost
something
whose
absence
could
never
be
quite
atoned
for
so
long
as
they
lived;
and
they
knew
that
heavy
falling
rain
was
soaking
into
the
wet
earth
which
covered
their
lost
darling,
and
that
the
sad,
sighing
gale
was
mourning
above
her
buried
head.
The
fire
warmed
them;
life
and
friendship
yet
blessed
them;
but
Jessie
lay
cold,
coffined,
solitary
only
the
sod
screening
her
from
the
storm.
Mrs.
Yorke
folded
up
her
knitting,
cut
short
the
music
lesson
and
the
lecture
on
politics,
and
concluded
her
visit
to
the
cottage,
at
an
hour
early
enough
to
ensure
her
return
to
Briarmains
before
the
blush
of
sunset
should
quite
have
faded
in
heaven,
or
the
path
up
the
fields
have
become
thoroughly
moist
with
evening
dew.
The
lady
and
her
daughters
being
gone,
Caroline
felt
that
she
also
ought
to
resume
her
scarf,
kiss
her
cousin's
cheek,
and
trip
away
homeward.
If
she
lingered
much
later
dusk
would
draw
on,
and
Fanny
would
be
put
to
the
trouble
of
coming
to
fetch
her.
It
was
both
baking
and
ironing
day
at
the
rectory,
she
remembered
Fanny
would
be
busy.
Still,
she
could
not
quit
her
seat
at
the
little
parlour
window.
From
no
point
of
view
could
the
west
look
so
lovely
as
from
that
lattice
with
the
garland
of
jessamine
round
it,
whose
white
stars
and
green
leaves
seemed
now
but
gray
pencil
outlines
graceful
in
form,
but
colourless
in
tint
against
the
gold
incarnadined
of
a
summer
evening
against
the
fire
tinged
blue
of
an
August
sky
at
eight
o'clock
p.m.
Caroline
looked
at
the
wicket
gate,
beside
which
holly
oaks
spired
up
tall.
She
looked
at
the
close
hedge
of
privet
and
laurel
fencing
in
the
garden;
her
eyes
longed
to
see
