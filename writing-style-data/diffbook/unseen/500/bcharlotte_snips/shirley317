consulting
the
mirror,
it
reflected
an
unanimous
vote
against
her.
"You
must
go,"
said
Mr.
Hall,
"and
behave
courteously
too.
You
owe
many
duties
to
society.
It
is
not
permitted
you
to
please
only
yourself."
Louis
Moore
assented
with
a
low
"Hear,
hear!"
Caroline,
approaching
her,
smoothed
her
wavy
curls,
gave
to
her
attire
a
less
artistic
and
more
domestic
grace,
and
Shirley
was
put
out
of
the
room,
protesting
still,
by
a
pouting
lip,
against
her
dismissal.
"There
is
a
curious
charm
about
her,"
observed
Mr.
Hall,
when
she
was
gone.
"And
now,"
he
added,
"I
must
away;
for
Sweeting
is
off
to
see
his
mother,
and
there
are
two
funerals."
"Henry,
get
your
books;
it
is
lesson
time,"
said
Moore,
sitting
down
to
his
desk.
"A
curious
charm!"
repeated
the
pupil,
when
he
and
his
master
were
left
alone.
"True.
Is
she
not
a
kind
of
white
witch?"
he
asked.
"Of
whom
are
you
speaking,
sir?"
"Of
my
cousin
Shirley."
"No
irrelevant
questions;
study
in
silence."
Mr.
Moore
looked
and
spoke
sternly
sourly.
Henry
knew
this
mood.
It
was
a
rare
one
with
his
tutor;
but
when
it
came
he
had
an
awe
of
it.
He
obeyed.
Miss
Keeldar
and
her
uncle
had
characters
that
would
not
harmonize,
that
never
had
harmonized.
He
was
irritable,
and
she
was
spirited.
He
was
despotic,
and
she
liked
freedom.
He
was
worldly,
and
she,
perhaps,
romantic.
Not
without
purpose
had
he
come
down
to
Yorkshire.
His
mission
was
clear,
and
he
intended
to
discharge
it
conscientiously.
He
anxiously
desired
to
have
his
niece
married,
to
make
for
her
a
suitable
match,
give
her
in
charge
to
a
proper
husband,
and
wash
his
hands
of
her
for
ever.
The
misfortune
was,
from
infancy
upwards,
Shirley
and
he
had
disagreed
on
the
meaning
of
the
words
"suitable"
and
"proper."
She
never
yet
had
accepted
his
definition;
and
it
was
doubtful
whether,
in
the
most
important
step
of
her
life,
she
would
consent
to
accept
it.
The
trial
soon
came.
Mr.
Wynne
proposed
in
form
for
his
son,
Samuel
Fawthrop
Wynne.
"Decidedly
suitable!
most
proper!"
pronounced
Mr.
Sympson.
"A
fine
unencumbered
estate,
real
substance,
good
connections.
It
must
be
done!"
He
sent
for
his
niece
to
the
oak
parlour;
he
shut
himself
up
there
with
her
alone;
he
communicated
the
offer;
he
gave
his
opinion;
he
claimed
her
consent.
It
was
withheld.
"No;
I
shall
not
marry
Samuel
Fawthrop
Wynne."
"I
ask
why.
I
must
have
a
reason.
In
all
respects
he
is
more
than
worthy
of
you."
She
stood
on
the
hearth.
She
was
pale
as
the
white
marble
slab
and
cornice
behind
her;
her
eyes
flashed
large,
dilated,
unsmiling.
"And
I
ask
in
what
sense
that
young
man
is
worthy
of
me?"
"He
has
twice
your
money,
twice
your
common
sense,
equal
connections,
equal
respectability."
"Had
he
my
money
counted
fivescore
times
I
would
take
no
vow
to
love
him."
"Please
to
state
your
objections."
"He
has
run
a
course
of
despicable,
