nights
ago,"
said
he.
"I
could
not
hear
you
then.
My
attention
is
now
at
your
service.
A
little
renewed
practice
in
French
may
not
be
unprofitable.
Your
accent,
I
have
observed,
begins
to
rust."
"What
book
shall
I
take?"
"Here
are
the
posthumous
works
of
St.
Pierre.
Read
a
few
pages
of
the
'Fragments
de
l'Amazone.'"
She
accepted
the
chair
which
he
had
placed
in
readiness
near
his
own;
the
volume
lay
on
his
desk
there
was
but
one
between
them;
her
sweeping
curls
dropped
so
low
as
to
hide
the
page
from
him.
"Put
back
your
hair,"
he
said.
For
one
moment
Shirley
looked
not
quite
certain
whether
she
would
obey
the
request
or
disregard
it.
A
flicker
of
her
eye
beamed
furtive
on
the
professor's
face.
Perhaps
if
he
had
been
looking
at
her
harshly
or
timidly,
or
if
one
undecided
line
had
marked
his
countenance,
she
would
have
rebelled,
and
the
lesson
had
ended
there
and
then;
but
he
was
only
awaiting
her
compliance
as
calm
as
marble,
and
as
cool.
She
threw
the
veil
of
tresses
behind
her
ear.
It
was
well
her
face
owned
an
agreeable
outline,
and
that
her
cheek
possessed
the
polish
and
the
roundness
of
early
youth,
or,
thus
robbed
of
a
softening
shade,
the
contours
might
have
lost
their
grace.
But
what
mattered
that
in
the
present
society?
Neither
Calypso
nor
Eucharis
cared
to
fascinate
Mentor.
She
began
to
read.
The
language
had
become
strange
to
her
tongue;
it
faltered;
the
lecture
flowed
unevenly,
impeded
by
hurried
breath,
broken
by
Anglicized
tones.
She
stopped.
"I
can't
do
it.
Read
me
a
paragraph,
if
you
please,
Mr.
Moore."
What
he
read
she
repeated.
She
caught
his
accent
in
three
minutes.
"Tres
bien,"
was
the
approving
comment
at
the
close
of
the
piece.
"C'est
presque
le
Francais
rattrape,
n'est
ce
pas?"
"You
could
not
write
French
as
you
once
could,
I
dare
say?"
"Oh
no!
I
should
make
strange
work
of
my
concords
now."
"You
could
not
compose
the
devoir
of
'La
Premiere
Femme
Savante'?"
"Do
you
still
remember
that
rubbish?"
"Every
line."
"I
doubt
you."
"I
will
engage
to
repeat
it
word
for
word."
"You
would
stop
short
at
the
first
line."
"Challenge
me
to
the
experiment."
"I
challenge
you."
He
proceeded
to
recite
the
following.
He
gave
it
in
French,
but
we
must
translate,
on
pain
of
being
unintelligible
to
some
readers.
"And
it
came
to
pass,
when
men
began
to
multiply
on
the
face
of
the
earth,
and
daughters
were
born
unto
them,
that
the
sons
of
God
saw
the
daughters
of
men
that
they
were
fair;
and
they
took
them
wives
of
all
which
they
chose."
This
was
in
the
dawn
of
time,
before
the
morning
stars
were
set,
and
while
they
yet
sang
together.
The
epoch
is
so
remote,
the
mists
and
dewy
gray
of
matin
twilight
veil
it
with
so
vague
an
obscurity,
that
all
distinct
feature
of
custom,
all
clear
line
of
locality,
evade
perception
