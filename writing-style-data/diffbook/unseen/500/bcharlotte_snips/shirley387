ill
afford
to
dispense;
the
second,
third,
fourth,
to
get
his
mother,
Miss
Moore,
and
Mrs.
Horsfall
successfully
out
of
the
way
before
four
o'clock
that
afternoon.
The
first
was,
for
the
present,
the
most
pressing,
since
the
work
before
him
demanded
an
amount
of
energy
which
the
present
empty
condition
of
his
youthful
stomach
did
not
seem
likely
to
supply.
Martin
knew
the
way
to
the
larder,
and
knowing
this
way
he
took
it.
The
servants
were
in
the
kitchen,
breakfasting
solemnly
with
closed
doors;
his
mother
and
Miss
Moore
were
airing
themselves
on
the
lawn,
and
discussing
the
closed
doors
aforesaid.
Martin,
safe
in
the
larder,
made
fastidious
selection
from
its
stores.
His
breakfast
had
been
delayed;
he
was
determined
it
should
be
recherche.
It
appeared
to
him
that
a
variety
on
his
usual
somewhat
insipid
fare
of
bread
and
milk
was
both
desirable
and
advisable;
the
savoury
and
the
salutary
he
thought
might
be
combined.
There
was
store
of
rosy
apples
laid
in
straw
upon
a
shelf;
he
picked
out
three.
There
was
pastry
upon
a
dish;
he
selected
an
apricot
puff
and
a
damson
tart.
On
the
plain
household
bread
his
eye
did
not
dwell;
but
he
surveyed
with
favour
some
currant
tea
cakes,
and
condescended
to
make
choice
of
one.
Thanks
to
his
clasp
knife,
he
was
able
to
appropriate
a
wing
of
fowl
and
a
slice
of
ham;
a
cantlet
of
cold
custard
pudding
he
thought
would
harmonize
with
these
articles;
and
having
made
this
final
addition
to
his
booty,
he
at
length
sallied
forth
into
the
hall.
He
was
already
half
way
across
three
steps
more
would
have
anchored
him
in
the
harbour
of
the
back
parlour
when
the
front
door
opened,
and
there
stood
Matthew.
Better
far
had
it
been
the
Old
Gentleman,
in
full
equipage
of
horns,
hoofs,
and
tail.
Matthew,
sceptic
and
scoffer,
had
already
failed
to
subscribe
a
prompt
belief
in
that
pain
about
the
heart.
He
had
muttered
some
words,
amongst
which
the
phrase
"shamming
Abraham"
had
been
very
distinctly
audible,
and
the
succession
to
the
armchair
and
newspaper
had
appeared
to
affect
him
with
mental
spasms.
The
spectacle
now
before
him
the
apples,
the
tarts,
the
tea
cakes,
the
fowl,
ham,
and
pudding
offered
evidence
but
too
well
calculated
to
inflate
his
opinion
of
his
own
sagacity.
Martin
paused
interdit
one
minute,
one
instant;
the
next
he
knew
his
ground,
and
pronounced
all
well.
With
the
true
perspicacity
des
ames
elites,
he
at
once
saw
how
this
at
first
sight
untoward
event
might
be
turned
to
excellent
account.
He
saw
how
it
might
be
so
handled
as
to
secure
the
accomplishment
of
his
second
task
namely,
the
disposal
of
his
mother.
He
knew
that
a
collision
between
him
and
Matthew
always
suggested
to
Mrs.
Yorke
the
propriety
of
a
fit
of
hysterics.
He
further
knew
that,
on
the
principle
of
calm
succeeding
to
storm,
after
a
morning
of
hysterics
his
mother
was
sure
to
indulge
in
an
