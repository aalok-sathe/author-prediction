Having
met
once
they
must
meet
again."
Briarmains
being
nearer
than
the
Hollow,
Mr.
Yorke
had
conveyed
his
young
comrade
there.
He
had
seen
him
laid
in
the
best
bed
of
the
house,
as
carefully
as
if
he
had
been
one
of
his
own
sons.
The
sight
of
his
blood,
welling
from
the
treacherously
inflicted
wound,
made
him
indeed
the
son
of
the
Yorkshire
gentleman's
heart.
The
spectacle
of
the
sudden
event,
of
the
tall,
straight
shape
prostrated
in
its
pride
across
the
road,
of
the
fine
southern
head
laid
low
in
the
dust,
of
that
youth
in
prime
flung
at
once
before
him
pallid,
lifeless,
helpless
this
was
the
very
combination
of
circumstances
to
win
for
the
victim
Mr.
Yorke's
liveliest
interest.
No
other
hand
was
there
to
raise
to
aid,
no
other
voice
to
question
kindly,
no
other
brain
to
concert
measures;
he
had
to
do
it
all
himself.
This
utter
dependence
of
the
speechless,
bleeding
youth
(as
a
youth
he
regarded
him)
on
his
benevolence
secured
that
benevolence
most
effectually.
Well
did
Mr.
Yorke
like
to
have
power,
and
to
use
it.
He
had
now
between
his
hands
power
over
a
fellow
creature's
life.
It
suited
him.
No
less
perfectly
did
it
suit
his
saturnine
better
half.
The
incident
was
quite
in
her
way
and
to
her
taste.
Some
women
would
have
been
terror
struck
to
see
a
gory
man
brought
in
over
their
threshold,
and
laid
down
in
their
hall
in
the
"howe
of
the
night."
There,
you
would
suppose,
was
subject
matter
for
hysterics.
No.
Mrs.
Yorke
went
into
hysterics
when
Jessie
would
not
leave
the
garden
to
come
to
her
knitting,
or
when
Martin
proposed
starting
for
Australia,
with
a
view
to
realize
freedom
and
escape
the
tyranny
of
Matthew;
but
an
attempted
murder
near
her
door
a
half
murdered
man
in
her
best
bed
set
her
straight,
cheered
her
spirits,
gave
her
cap
the
dash
of
a
turban.
Mrs.
Yorke
was
just
the
woman
who,
while
rendering
miserable
the
drudging
life
of
a
simple
maid
servant,
would
nurse
like
a
heroine
a
hospital
full
of
plague
patients.
She
almost
loved
Moore.
Her
tough
heart
almost
yearned
towards
him
when
she
found
him
committed
to
her
charge
left
in
her
arms,
as
dependent
on
her
as
her
youngest
born
in
the
cradle.
Had
she
seen
a
domestic
or
one
of
her
daughters
give
him
a
draught
of
water
or
smooth
his
pillow,
she
would
have
boxed
the
intruder's
ears.
She
chased
Jessie
and
Rose
from
the
upper
realm
of
the
house;
she
forbade
the
housemaids
to
set
their
foot
in
it.
Now,
if
the
accident
had
happened
at
the
rectory
gates,
and
old
Helstone
had
taken
in
the
martyr,
neither
Yorke
nor
his
wife
would
have
pitied
him.
They
would
have
adjudged
him
right
served
for
his
tyranny
and
meddling.
As
it
was,
he
became,
for
the
present,
the
apple
of
their
eye.
Strange!
Louis
Moore
was
permitted
to
come
to
sit
down
on
