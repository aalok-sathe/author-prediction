moving
mass.
The
rioters
were
assembled
in
front
of
the
closed
yard
gates,
and
a
single
figure
stood
within,
apparently
addressing
them.
The
mill
itself
was
perfectly
black
and
still.
There
was
neither
life,
light,
nor
motion
around
it.
"Surely
he
is
prepared.
Surely
that
is
not
Moore
meeting
them
alone?"
whispered
Shirley.
"It
is.
We
must
go
to
him.
I
will
go
to
him."
"That
you
will
not."
"Why
did
I
come,
then?
I
came
only
for
him.
I
shall
join
him."
"Fortunately
it
is
out
of
your
power.
There
is
no
entrance
to
the
yard."
"There
is
a
small
entrance
at
the
back,
besides
the
gates
in
front.
It
opens
by
a
secret
method
which
I
know.
I
will
try
it."
"Not
with
my
leave."
Miss
Keeldar
clasped
her
round
the
waist
with
both
arms
and
held
her
back.
"Not
one
step
shall
you
stir,"
she
went
on
authoritatively.
"At
this
moment
Moore
would
be
both
shocked
and
embarrassed
if
he
saw
either
you
or
me.
Men
never
want
women
near
them
in
time
of
real
danger."
"I
would
not
trouble
I
would
help
him,"
was
the
reply.
"How?
by
inspiring
him
with
heroism?
Pooh!
these
are
not
the
days
of
chivalry.
It
is
not
a
tilt
at
a
tournament
we
are
going
to
behold,
but
a
struggle
about
money,
and
food,
and
life."
"It
is
natural
that
I
should
be
at
his
side."
"As
queen
of
his
heart?
His
mill
is
his
lady
love,
Cary!
Backed
by
his
factory
and
his
frames,
he
has
all
the
encouragement
he
wants
or
can
know.
It
is
not
for
love
or
beauty,
but
for
ledger
and
broadcloth,
he
is
going
to
break
a
spear.
Don't
be
sentimental;
Robert
is
not
so."
"I
could
help
him;
I
will
seek
him."
"Off
then
I
let
you
go
seek
Moore.
You'll
not
find
him."
She
loosened
her
hold.
Caroline
sped
like
levelled
shaft
from
bent
bow;
after
her
rang
a
jesting,
gibing
laugh.
"Look
well
there
is
no
mistake!"
was
the
warning
given.
But
there
was
a
mistake.
Miss
Helstone
paused,
hesitated,
gazed.
The
figure
had
suddenly
retreated
from
the
gate,
and
was
running
back
hastily
to
the
mill.
"Make
haste,
Lina!"
cried
Shirley;
"meet
him
before
he
enters."
Caroline
slowly
returned.
"It
is
not
Robert,"
she
said.
"It
has
neither
his
height,
form,
nor
bearing."
"I
saw
it
was
not
Robert
when
I
let
you
go.
How
could
you
imagine
it?
It
is
a
shabby
little
figure
of
a
private
soldier;
they
had
posted
him
as
sentinel.
He
is
safe
in
the
mill
now.
I
saw
the
door
open
and
admit
him.
My
mind
grows
easier.
Robert
is
prepared.
Our
warning
would
have
been
superfluous;
and
now
I
am
thankful
we
came
too
late
to
give
it.
It
has
saved
us
the
trouble
of
a
scene.
How
fine
to
have
entered
the
counting
house
toute
eperdue,
and
to
have
found
oneself
in
presence
of
Messrs.
Armitage
and
Ramsden
smoking,
Malone
swaggering,
your
