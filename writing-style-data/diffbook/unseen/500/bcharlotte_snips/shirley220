Caroline's
imagination
not
the
mighty
and
mystical
parent
of
Shirley's
visions,
but
a
gentle
human
form
the
form
she
ascribed
to
her
own
mother,
unknown,
unloved,
but
not
unlonged
for.
"Oh
that
the
day
would
come
when
she
would
remember
her
child!
Oh
that
I
might
know
her,
and
knowing,
love
her!"
Such
was
her
aspiration.
The
longing
of
her
childhood
filled
her
soul
again.
The
desire
which
many
a
night
had
kept
her
awake
in
her
crib,
and
which
fear
of
its
fallacy
had
of
late
years
almost
extinguished,
relit
suddenly,
and
glowed
warm
in
her
heart,
that
her
mother
might
come
some
happy
day,
and
send
for
her
to
her
presence,
look
upon
her
fondly
with
loving
eyes,
and
say
to
her
tenderly,
in
a
sweet
voice,
"Caroline,
my
child,
I
have
a
home
for
you;
you
shall
live
with
me.
All
the
love
you
have
needed,
and
not
tasted,
from
infancy,
I
have
saved
for
you
carefully.
Come;
it
shall
cherish
you
now."
A
noise
on
the
road
roused
Caroline
from
her
filial
hopes,
and
Shirley
from
her
Titan
visions.
They
listened,
and
heard
the
tramp
of
horses.
They
looked,
and
saw
a
glitter
through
the
trees.
They
caught
through
the
foliage
glimpses
of
martial
scarlet;
helm
shone,
plume
waved.
Silent
and
orderly,
six
soldiers
rode
softly
by.
"The
same
we
saw
this
afternoon,"
whispered
Shirley.
"They
have
been
halting
somewhere
till
now.
They
wish
to
be
as
little
noticed
as
possible,
and
are
seeking
their
rendezvous
at
this
quiet
hour,
while
the
people
are
at
church.
Did
I
not
say
we
should
see
unusual
things
ere
long?"
Scarcely
were
sight
and
sound
of
the
soldiers
lost,
when
another
and
somewhat
different
disturbance
broke
the
night
hush
a
child's
impatient
scream.
They
looked.
A
man
issued
from
the
church,
carrying
in
his
arms
an
infant
a
robust,
ruddy
little
boy
of
some
two
years
old
roaring
with
all
the
power
of
his
lungs.
He
had
probably
just
awaked
from
a
church
sleep.
Two
little
girls,
of
nine
and
ten,
followed.
The
influence
of
the
fresh
air,
and
the
attraction
of
some
flowers
gathered
from
a
grave,
soon
quieted
the
child.
The
man
sat
down
with
him,
dandling
him
on
his
knee
as
tenderly
as
any
woman;
the
two
little
girls
took
their
places
one
on
each
side.
"Good
evening,
William,"
said
Shirley,
after
due
scrutiny
of
the
man.
He
had
seen
her
before,
and
apparently
was
waiting
to
be
recognized.
He
now
took
off
his
hat,
and
grinned
a
smile
of
pleasure.
He
was
a
rough
headed,
hard
featured
personage,
not
old,
but
very
weather
beaten.
His
attire
was
decent
and
clean;
that
of
his
children
singularly
neat.
It
was
our
old
friend
Farren.
The
young
ladies
approached
him.
"You
are
not
going
into
the
church?"
he
inquired,
gazing
at
them
complacently,
yet
with
a
mixture
of
bashfulness
in
his
look
a
sentiment
not
by
any
means
the
result
of
awe
of
their
station,
but
only
of
