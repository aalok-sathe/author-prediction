will
be
a
scene.
I
neither
invite
it
nor
fear
it;
only,
you
must
be
present,
for
I
am
inexpressibly
tired
of
facing
him
solus.
I
don't
like
to
see
him
in
a
rage.
He
then
puts
off
all
his
fine
proprieties
and
conventional
disguises,
and
the
real
human
being
below
is
what
you
would
call
commun,
plat,
bas
vilain
et
un
peu
mechant.
His
ideas
are
not
clean,
Mr.
Moore;
they
want
scouring
with
soft
soap
and
fuller's
earth.
I
think,
if
he
could
add
his
imagination
to
the
contents
of
Mrs.
Gill's
bucking
basket,
and
let
her
boil
it
in
her
copper,
with
rain
water
and
bleaching
powder
(I
hope
you
think
me
a
tolerable
laundress),
it
would
do
him
incalculable
good.'
"This
morning,
fancying
I
heard
her
descend
somewhat
early,
I
was
down
instantly.
I
had
not
been
deceived.
There
she
was,
busy
at
work
in
the
breakfast
parlour,
of
which
the
housemaid
was
completing
the
arrangement
and
dusting.
She
had
risen
betimes
to
finish
some
little
keepsake
she
intended
for
Henry.
I
got
only
a
cool
reception,
which
I
accepted
till
the
girl
was
gone,
taking
my
book
to
the
window
seat
very
quietly.
Even
when
we
were
alone
I
was
slow
to
disturb
her.
To
sit
with
her
in
sight
was
happiness,
and
the
proper
happiness,
for
early
morning
serene,
incomplete,
but
progressive.
Had
I
been
obtrusive,
I
knew
I
should
have
encountered
rebuff.
'Not
at
home
to
suitors'
was
written
on
her
brow.
Therefore
I
read
on,
stole
now
and
then
a
look,
watched
her
countenance
soften
and
open
as
she
felt
I
respected
her
mood,
and
enjoyed
the
gentle
content
of
the
moment.
"The
distance
between
us
shrank,
and
the
light
hoar
frost
thawed
insensibly.
Ere
an
hour
elapsed
I
was
at
her
side,
watching
her
sew,
gathering
her
sweet
smiles
and
her
merry
words,
which
fell
for
me
abundantly.
We
sat,
as
we
had
a
right
to
sit,
side
by
side;
my
arm
rested
on
her
chair;
I
was
near
enough
to
count
the
stitches
of
her
work,
and
to
discern
the
eye
of
her
needle.
The
door
suddenly
opened.
"I
believe,
if
I
had
just
then
started
from
her,
she
would
have
despised
me.
Thanks
to
the
phlegm
of
my
nature,
I
rarely
start.
When
I
am
well
off,
bien,
comfortable,
I
am
not
soon
stirred.
Bien
I
was
tres
bien
consequently
immutable.
No
muscle
moved.
I
hardly
looked
to
the
door.
"'Good
morning,
uncle,'
said
she,
addressing
that
personage,
who
paused
on
the
threshold
in
a
state
of
petrifaction.
"'Have
you
been
long
downstairs,
Miss
Keeldar,
and
alone
with
Mr.
Moore?'
"'Yes,
a
very
long
time.
We
both
came
down
early;
it
was
scarcely
light.'
"'The
proceeding
is
improper
'
"'It
was
at
first,
I
was
rather
cross,
and
not
civil;
but
you
will
perceive
that
we
are
now
friends.'
"'I
perceive
more
than
you
would
wish
me
to
perceive.'
"'Hardly,
sir,'
said
I;
'we
have
no
disguises.
Will
you
