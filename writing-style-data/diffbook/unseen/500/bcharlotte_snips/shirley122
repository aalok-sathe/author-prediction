they
are
not
pretty,
and
young,
and
merry!
And
I
will
certainly
call
to
see
Miss
Mann
too.
She
may
not
be
amiable,
but
what
has
made
her
unamiable?
What
has
life
been
to
her?"
Fanny
helped
Miss
Helstone
to
put
away
her
work,
and
afterwards
assisted
her
to
dress.
"You'll
not
be
an
old
maid,
Miss
Caroline,"
she
said,
as
she
tied
the
sash
of
her
brown
silk
frock,
having
previously
smoothed
her
soft,
full,
and
shining
curls;
"there
are
no
signs
of
an
old
maid
about
you."
Caroline
looked
at
the
little
mirror
before
her,
and
she
thought
there
were
some
signs.
She
could
see
that
she
was
altered
within
the
last
month;
that
the
hues
of
her
complexion
were
paler,
her
eyes
changed
a
wan
shade
seemed
to
circle
them;
her
countenance
was
dejected
she
was
not,
in
short,
so
pretty
or
so
fresh
as
she
used
to
be.
She
distantly
hinted
this
to
Fanny,
from
whom
she
got
no
direct
answer,
only
a
remark
that
people
did
vary
in
their
looks,
but
that
at
her
age
a
little
falling
away
signified
nothing;
she
would
soon
come
round
again,
and
be
plumper
and
rosier
than
ever.
Having
given
this
assurance,
Fanny
showed
singular
zeal
in
wrapping
her
up
in
warm
shawls
and
handkerchiefs,
till
Caroline,
nearly
smothered
with
the
weight,
was
fain
to
resist
further
additions.
She
paid
her
visits
first
to
Miss
Mann,
for
this
was
the
most
difficult
point.
Miss
Mann
was
certainly
not
quite
a
lovable
person.
Till
now,
Caroline
had
always
unhesitatingly
declared
she
disliked
her,
and
more
than
once
she
had
joined
her
cousin
Robert
in
laughing
at
some
of
her
peculiarities.
Moore
was
not
habitually
given
to
sarcasm,
especially
on
anything
humbler
or
weaker
than
himself;
but
he
had
once
or
twice
happened
to
be
in
the
room
when
Miss
Mann
had
made
a
call
on
his
sister,
and
after
listening
to
her
conversation
and
viewing
her
features
for
a
time,
he
had
gone
out
into
the
garden
where
his
little
cousin
was
tending
some
of
his
favourite
flowers,
and
while
standing
near
and
watching
her
he
had
amused
himself
with
comparing
fair
youth,
delicate
and
attractive,
with
shrivelled
eld,
livid
and
loveless,
and
in
jestingly
repeating
to
a
smiling
girl
the
vinegar
discourse
of
a
cankered
old
maid.
Once
on
such
an
occasion
Caroline
had
said
to
him,
looking
up
from
the
luxuriant
creeper
she
was
binding
to
its
frame,
"Ah!
Robert,
you
do
not
like
old
maids.
I,
too,
should
come
under
the
lash
of
your
sarcasm
if
I
were
an
old
maid."
"You
an
old
maid!"
he
had
replied.
"A
piquant
notion
suggested
by
lips
of
that
tint
and
form.
I
can
fancy
you,
though,
at
forty,
quietly
dressed,
pale
and
sunk,
but
still
with
that
straight
nose,
white
forehead,
and
those
soft
eyes.
I
suppose,
too,
you
will
keep
your
voice,
which
has
another
'timbre'
than
that
hard,
deep
organ
of
Miss
Mann's.
Courage,
Cary!
