the
baronet
to
a
point.
He
had
observed
that
Miss
Keeldar
looked
pensive
and
delicate.
This
new
phase
in
her
demeanour
smote
him
on
his
weak
or
poetic
side.
A
spontaneous
sonnet
brewed
in
his
brain;
and
while
it
was
still
working
there,
one
of
his
sisters
persuaded
his
lady
love
to
sit
down
to
the
piano
and
sing
a
ballad
one
of
Sir
Philip's
own
ballads.
It
was
the
least
elaborate,
the
least
affected
out
of
all
comparison
the
best
of
his
numerous
efforts.
It
chanced
that
Shirley,
the
moment
before,
had
been
gazing
from
a
window
down
on
the
park.
She
had
seen
that
stormy
moonlight
which
"le
Professeur
Louis"
was
perhaps
at
the
same
instant
contemplating
from
her
own
oak
parlour
lattice;
she
had
seen
the
isolated
trees
of
the
domain
broad,
strong,
spreading
oaks,
and
high
towering
heroic
beeches
wrestling
with
the
gale.
Her
ear
had
caught
the
full
roar
of
the
forest
lower
down;
the
swift
rushing
of
clouds,
the
moon,
to
the
eye,
hasting
swifter
still,
had
crossed
her
vision.
She
turned
from
sight
and
sound
touched,
if
not
rapt;
wakened,
if
not
inspired.
She
sang,
as
requested.
There
was
much
about
love
in
the
ballad
faithful
love
that
refused
to
abandon
its
object;
love
that
disaster
could
not
shake;
love
that
in
calamity
waxed
fonder,
in
poverty
clung
closer.
The
words
were
set
to
a
fine
old
air;
in
themselves
they
were
simple
and
sweet.
Perhaps,
when
read,
they
wanted
force;
when
well
sung,
they
wanted
nothing.
Shirley
sang
them
well.
She
breathed
into
the
feeling
softness;
she
poured
round
the
passion
force.
Her
voice
was
fine
that
evening,
its
expression
dramatic.
She
impressed
all,
and
charmed
one.
On
leaving
the
instrument
she
went
to
the
fire,
and
sat
down
on
a
seat
semi
stool,
semi
cushion.
The
ladies
were
round
her;
none
of
them
spoke.
The
Misses
Sympson
and
the
Misses
Nunnely
looked
upon
her
as
quiet
poultry
might
look
on
an
egret,
an
ibis,
or
any
other
strange
fowl.
What
made
her
sing
so?
They
never
sang
so.
Was
it
proper
to
sing
with
such
expression,
with
such
originality
so
unlike
a
school
girl?
Decidedly
not.
It
was
strange,
it
was
unusual.
What
was
strange
must
be
wrong;
what
was
unusual
must
be
improper.
Shirley
was
judged.
Moreover,
old
Lady
Nunnely
eyed
her
stonily
from
her
great
chair
by
the
fireside.
Her
gaze
said,
"This
woman
is
not
of
mine
or
my
daughters'
kind.
I
object
to
her
as
my
son's
wife."
Her
son,
catching
the
look,
read
its
meaning.
He
grew
alarmed.
What
he
so
wished
to
win
there
was
danger
he
might
lose.
He
must
make
haste.
The
room
they
were
in
had
once
been
a
picture
gallery.
Sir
Philip's
father
Sir
Monckton
had
converted
it
into
a
saloon;
but
still
it
had
a
shadowy,
long
withdrawing
look.
A
deep
recess
with
a
window
a
recess
that
held
one
couch,
one
table,
and
a
fairy
cabinet
formed
a
room
