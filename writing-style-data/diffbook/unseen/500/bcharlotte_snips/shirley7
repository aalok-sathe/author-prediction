in
a
decent
English
parish,
bring
disgrace
on
those
who
indulge
in
them,
and,
what
is
far
worse,
on
the
sacred
institution
of
which
they
are
merely
the
humble
appendages."
There
was
a
certain
dignity
in
the
little
elderly
gentleman's
manner
of
rebuking
these
youths,
though
it
was
not,
perhaps,
quite
the
dignity
most
appropriate
to
the
occasion.
Mr.
Helstone,
standing
straight
as
a
ramrod,
looking
keen
as
a
kite,
presented,
despite
his
clerical
hat,
black
coat,
and
gaiters,
more
the
air
of
a
veteran
officer
chiding
his
subalterns
than
of
a
venerable
priest
exhorting
his
sons
in
the
faith.
Gospel
mildness,
apostolic
benignity,
never
seemed
to
have
breathed
their
influence
over
that
keen
brown
visage,
but
firmness
had
fixed
the
features,
and
sagacity
had
carved
her
own
lines
about
them.
"I
met
Supplehough,"
he
continued,
"plodding
through
the
mud
this
wet
night,
going
to
preach
at
Milldean
opposition
shop.
As
I
told
you,
I
heard
Barraclough
bellowing
in
the
midst
of
a
conventicle
like
a
possessed
bull;
and
I
find
you,
gentlemen,
tarrying
over
your
half
pint
of
muddy
port
wine,
and
scolding
like
angry
old
women.
No
wonder
Supplehough
should
have
dipped
sixteen
adult
converts
in
a
day
which
he
did
a
fortnight
since;
no
wonder
Barraclough,
scamp
and
hypocrite
as
he
is,
should
attract
all
the
weaver
girls
in
their
flowers
and
ribbons,
to
witness
how
much
harder
are
his
knuckles
than
the
wooden
brim
of
his
tub;
as
little
wonder
that
you,
when
you
are
left
to
yourselves,
without
your
rectors
myself,
and
Hall,
and
Boultby
to
back
you,
should
too
often
perform
the
holy
service
of
our
church
to
bare
walls,
and
read
your
bit
of
a
dry
discourse
to
the
clerk,
and
the
organist,
and
the
beadle.
But
enough
of
the
subject.
I
came
to
see
Malone.
I
have
an
errand
unto
thee,
O
captain!"
"What
is
it?"
inquired
Malone
discontentedly.
"There
can
be
no
funeral
to
take
at
this
time
of
day."
"Have
you
any
arms
about
you?"
"Arms,
sir?
yes,
and
legs."
And
he
advanced
the
mighty
members.
"Bah!
weapons
I
mean."
"I
have
the
pistols
you
gave
me
yourself.
I
never
part
with
them.
I
lay
them
ready
cocked
on
a
chair
by
my
bedside
at
night.
I
have
my
blackthorn."
"Very
good.
Will
you
go
to
Hollow's
Mill?"
"What
is
stirring
at
Hollow's
Mill?"
"Nothing
as
yet,
nor
perhaps
will
be;
but
Moore
is
alone
there.
He
has
sent
all
the
workmen
he
can
trust
to
Stilbro';
there
are
only
two
women
left
about
the
place.
It
would
be
a
nice
opportunity
for
any
of
his
well
wishers
to
pay
him
a
visit,
if
they
knew
how
straight
the
path
was
made
before
them."
"I
am
none
of
his
well
wishers,
sir.
I
don't
care
for
him."
"Soh!
Malone,
you
are
afraid."
"You
know
me
better
than
that.
If
I
really
thought
there
was
a
chance
of
a
row
I
would
go:
but
Moore
is
a
strange,
shy
man,
whom
