made
her
face
grow
hot
the
answer
was,
he
was
from
home,
or
he
was
quite
taken
up
with
business.
Hortense
feared
he
was
killing
himself
by
application.
He
scarcely
ever
took
a
meal
in
the
house;
he
lived
in
the
counting
house.
At
church
only
Caroline
had
the
chance
of
seeing
him,
and
there
she
rarely
looked
at
him.
It
was
both
too
much
pain
and
too
much
pleasure
to
look
it
excited
too
much
emotion;
and
that
it
was
all
wasted
emotion
she
had
learned
well
to
comprehend.
Once,
on
a
dark,
wet
Sunday,
when
there
were
few
people
at
church,
and
when
especially
certain
ladies
were
absent,
of
whose
observant
faculties
and
tomahawk
tongues
Caroline
stood
in
awe,
she
had
allowed
her
eye
to
seek
Robert's
pew,
and
to
rest
awhile
on
its
occupant.
He
was
there
alone.
Hortense
had
been
kept
at
home
by
prudent
considerations
relative
to
the
rain
and
a
new
spring
chapeau.
During
the
sermon
he
sat
with
folded
arms
and
eyes
cast
down,
looking
very
sad
and
abstracted.
When
depressed,
the
very
hue
of
his
face
seemed
more
dusk
than
when
he
smiled,
and
to
day
cheek
and
forehead
wore
their
most
tintless
and
sober
olive.
By
instinct
Caroline
knew,
as
she
examined
that
clouded
countenance,
that
his
thoughts
were
running
in
no
familiar
or
kindly
channel;
that
they
were
far
away,
not
merely
from
her,
but
from
all
which
she
could
comprehend,
or
in
which
she
could
sympathize.
Nothing
that
they
had
ever
talked
of
together
was
now
in
his
mind:
he
was
wrapt
from
her
by
interests
and
responsibilities
in
which
it
was
deemed
such
as
she
could
have
no
part.
Caroline
meditated
in
her
own
way
on
the
subject;
speculated
on
his
feelings,
on
his
life,
on
his
fears,
on
his
fate;
mused
over
the
mystery
of
"business,"
tried
to
comprehend
more
about
it
than
had
ever
been
told
her
to
understand
its
perplexities,
liabilities,
duties,
exactions;
endeavoured
to
realize
the
state
of
mind
of
a
"man
of
business,"
to
enter
into
it,
feel
what
he
would
feel,
aspire
to
what
he
would
aspire.
Her
earnest
wish
was
to
see
things
as
they
were,
and
not
to
be
romantic.
By
dint
of
effort
she
contrived
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
light
of
truth
here
and
there,
and
hoped
that
scant
ray
might
suffice
to
guide
her.
"Different,
indeed,"
she
concluded,
"is
Robert's
mental
condition
to
mine.
I
think
only
of
him;
he
has
no
room,
no
leisure,
to
think
of
me.
The
feeling
called
love
is
and
has
been
for
two
years
the
predominant
emotion
of
my
heart
always
there,
always
awake,
always
astir.
Quite
other
feelings
absorb
his
reflections
and
govern
his
faculties.
He
is
rising
now,
going
to
leave
the
church,
for
service
is
over.
Will
he
turn
his
head
towards
this
pew?
No,
not
once.
He
has
not
one
look
for
me.
That
is
hard.
A
kind
glance
would
have
made
me
happy
till
to
