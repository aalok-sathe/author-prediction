suppressed.
"No,"
returned
Shirley,
answering
the
smile;
"Captain
Gerard
Moore,
who
trusts
much
to
the
prowess
of
his
own
right
arm,
I
believe."
"Furnished
with
his
counting
house
ruler,"
added
Moore.
Resuming
his
usual
gravity,
he
went
on:
"I
received
by
this
evening's
post
a
note
from
the
Home
Secretary
in
answer
to
mine.
It
appears
they
are
uneasy
at
the
state
of
matters
here
in
the
north;
they
especially
condemn
the
supineness
and
pusillanimity
of
the
mill
owners.
They
say,
as
I
have
always
said,
that
inaction,
under
present
circumstances,
is
criminal,
and
that
cowardice
is
cruelty,
since
both
can
only
encourage
disorder,
and
lead
finally
to
sanguinary
outbreaks.
There
is
the
note
I
brought
it
for
your
perusal;
and
there
is
a
batch
of
newspapers,
containing
further
accounts
of
proceedings
in
Nottingham,
Manchester,
and
elsewhere."
He
produced
letters
and
journals,
and
laid
them
before
Miss
Keeldar.
While
she
perused
them
he
took
his
tea
quietly;
but
though
his
tongue
was
still,
his
observant
faculties
seemed
by
no
means
off
duty.
Mrs.
Pryor,
sitting
in
the
background,
did
not
come
within
the
range
of
his
glance,
but
the
two
younger
ladies
had
the
full
benefit
thereof.
Miss
Keeldar,
placed
directly
opposite,
was
seen
without
effort.
She
was
the
object
his
eyes,
when
lifted,
naturally
met
first;
and
as
what
remained
of
daylight
the
gilding
of
the
west
was
upon
her,
her
shape
rose
in
relief
from
the
dark
panelling
behind.
Shirley's
clear
cheek
was
tinted
yet
with
the
colour
which
had
risen
into
it
a
few
minutes
since.
The
dark
lashes
of
her
eyes
looking
down
as
she
read,
the
dusk
yet
delicate
line
of
her
eyebrows,
the
almost
sable
gloss
of
her
curls,
made
her
heightened
complexion
look
fine
as
the
bloom
of
a
red
wild
flower
by
contrast.
There
was
natural
grace
in
her
attitude,
and
there
was
artistic
effect
in
the
ample
and
shining
folds
of
her
silk
dress
an
attire
simply
fashioned,
but
almost
splendid
from
the
shifting
brightness
of
its
dye,
warp
and
woof
being
of
tints
deep
and
changing
as
the
hue
on
a
pheasant's
neck.
A
glancing
bracelet
on
her
arm
produced
the
contrast
of
gold
and
ivory.
There
was
something
brilliant
in
the
whole
picture.
It
is
to
be
supposed
that
Moore
thought
so,
as
his
eye
dwelt
long
on
it,
but
he
seldom
permitted
his
feelings
or
his
opinions
to
exhibit
themselves
in
his
face.
His
temperament
boasted
a
certain
amount
of
phlegm,
and
he
preferred
an
undemonstrative,
not
ungentle,
but
serious
aspect
to
any
other.
He
could
not,
by
looking
straight
before
him,
see
Caroline,
as
she
was
close
at
his
side.
It
was
necessary,
therefore,
to
maneauvre
a
little
to
get
her
well
within
the
range
of
his
observation.
He
leaned
back
in
his
chair,
and
looked
down
on
her.
In
Miss
Helstone
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
could
discover
brilliancy.
Sitting
in
the
shade,
without
flowers
or
ornaments,
her
attire
the
modest
muslin
dress,
colourless
but
