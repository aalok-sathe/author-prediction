of
the
moon,
the
changefulness
of
clouds.
I
want
and
will
have
something
different.
This
elfish
splendour
looks
chill
to
my
vision,
and
feels
frozen
to
my
touch.
I
am
not
a
poet;
I
cannot
live
with
abstractions.
You,
Miss
Keeldar,
have
sometimes,
in
your
laughing
satire,
called
me
a
material
philosopher,
and
implied
that
I
live
sufficiently
for
the
substantial.
Certainly
I
feel
material
from
head
to
foot;
and
glorious
as
Nature
is,
and
deeply
as
I
worship
her
with
the
solid
powers
of
a
solid
heart,
I
would
rather
behold
her
through
the
soft
human
eyes
of
a
loved
and
lovely
wife
than
through
the
wild
orbs
of
the
highest
goddess
of
Olympus.'
"'Juno
could
not
cook
a
buffalo
steak
as
you
like
it,'
said
she.
"'She
could
not;
but
I
will
tell
you
who
could
some
young,
penniless,
friendless
orphan
girl.
I
wish
I
could
find
such
a
one
pretty
enough
for
me
to
love,
with
something
of
the
mind
and
heart
suited
to
my
taste;
not
uneducated
honest
and
modest.
I
care
nothing
for
attainments,
but
I
would
fain
have
the
germ
of
those
sweet
natural
powers
which
nothing
acquired
can
rival;
any
temper
Fate
wills
I
can
manage
the
hottest.
To
such
a
creature
as
this
I
should
like
to
be
first
tutor
and
then
husband.
I
would
teach
her
my
language,
my
habits
and
my
principles,
and
then
I
would
reward
her
with
my
love.'
"'Reward
her,
lord
of
the
creation
reward
her!'"
ejaculated
she,
with
a
curled
lip.
"'And
be
repaid
a
thousandfold.'
"'If
she
willed
it,
monseigneur.'
"'And
she
should
will
it.'
"'You
have
stipulated
for
any
temper
Fate
wills.
Compulsion
is
flint
and
a
blow
to
the
metal
of
some
souls.'
"'And
love
the
spark
it
elicits.'
"'Who
cares
for
the
love
that
is
but
a
spark
seen,
flown
upward,
and
gone?'
"'I
must
find
my
orphan
girl.
Tell
me
how,
Miss
Keeldar.'
"'Advertise;
and
be
sure
you
add,
when
you
describe
the
qualifications,
she
must
be
a
good
plain
cook.'
"'I
must
find
her;
and
when
I
do
find
her
I
shall
marry
her.'
"'Not
you!'
and
her
voice
took
a
sudden
accent
of
peculiar
scorn.
"I
liked
this.
I
had
roused
her
from
the
pensive
mood
in
which
I
had
first
found
her.
I
would
stir
her
further.
"'Why
doubt
it?'
"'You
marry!'
"'Yes,
of
course;
nothing
more
evident
than
that
I
can
and
shall.'
"'The
contrary
is
evident,
Mr.
Moore.'
"She
charmed
me
in
this
mood
waxing
disdainful,
half
insulting;
pride,
temper,
derision,
blent
in
her
large
fine
eye,
that
had
just
now
the
look
of
a
merlin's.
"'Favour
me
with
your
reasons
for
such
an
opinion,
Miss
Keeldar.'
"'How
will
you
manage
to
marry,
I
wonder?'
"'I
shall
manage
it
with
ease
and
speed
when
I
find
the
proper
person.'
"'Accept
celibacy!'
(and
she
made
a
gesture
with
her
hand
as
if
she
gave
me
something)
'take
it
as
your
doom!'
"'No;
you
cannot
give
what
I
