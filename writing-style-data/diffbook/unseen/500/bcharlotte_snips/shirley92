to
appreciate
fully
the
uncommon
elegance
of
the
phraseology,
"it
might,
perhaps,
justly
be
said
that
reason
rather
than
peace
is
our
purpose.
We
come,
in
the
first
place,
to
request
you
to
hear
reason;
and
should
you
refuse,
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you,
in
very
decided
terms,
that
measures
will
be
had
resort
to"
(he
meant
recourse)
"which
will
probably
terminate
in
in
bringing
you
to
a
sense
of
the
unwisdom,
of
the
the
foolishness
which
seems
to
guide
and
guard
your
proceedings
as
a
tradesman
in
this
manufacturing
part
of
the
country.
Hem!
Sir,
I
would
beg
to
allude
that
as
a
furriner,
coming
from
a
distant
coast,
another
quarter
and
hemisphere
of
this
globe,
thrown,
as
I
may
say,
a
perfect
outcast
on
these
shores
the
cliffs
of
Albion
you
have
not
that
understanding
of
huz
and
wer
ways
which
might
conduce
to
the
benefit
of
the
working
classes.
If,
to
come
at
once
to
partic'lars,
you'd
consider
to
give
up
this
here
miln,
and
go
without
further
protractions
straight
home
to
where
you
belong,
it
'ud
happen
be
as
well.
I
can
see
naught
ageean
such
a
plan.
What
hev
ye
to
say
tull't,
lads?"
turning
round
to
the
other
members
of
the
deputation,
who
responded
unanimously,
"Hear,
hear!"
"Brayvo,
Noah
o'
Tim's!"
murmured
Joe
Scott,
who
stood
behind
Mr.
Moore.
"Moses'll
niver
beat
that.
Cliffs
o'
Albion,
and
t'
other
hemisphere!
My
certy!
Did
ye
come
fro'
th'
Antarctic
Zone,
maister?
Moses
is
dished."
Moses,
however,
refused
to
be
dished.
He
thought
he
would
try
again.
Casting
a
somewhat
ireful
glance
at
"Noah
o'
Tim's,"
he
launched
out
in
his
turn;
and
now
he
spoke
in
a
serious
tone,
relinquishing
the
sarcasm
which
he
found
had
not
answered.
"Or
iver
you
set
up
the
pole
o'
your
tent
amang
us,
Mr.
Moore,
we
lived
i'
peace
and
quietness
yea,
I
may
say,
in
all
loving
kindness.
I
am
not
myself
an
aged
person
as
yet,
but
I
can
remember
as
far
back
as
maybe
some
twenty
year,
when
hand
labour
were
encouraged
and
respected,
and
no
mischief
maker
had
ventured
to
introduce
these
here
machines
which
is
so
pernicious.
Now,
I'm
not
a
cloth
dresser
myself,
but
by
trade
a
tailor.
Howsiver,
my
heart
is
of
a
softish
nature.
I'm
a
very
feeling
man,
and
when
I
see
my
brethren
oppressed,
like
my
great
namesake
of
old,
I
stand
up
for
'em;
for
which
intent
I
this
day
speak
with
you
face
to
face,
and
advises
you
to
part
wi'
your
infernal
machinery,
and
tak
on
more
hands."
"What
if
I
don't
follow
your
advice,
Mr.
Barraclough?"
"The
Looard
pardon
you!
The
Looard
soften
your
heart,
sir!"
"Are
you
in
connection
with
the
Wesleyans
now,
Mr.
Barraclough?"
"Praise
God!
Bless
His
name!
I'm
a
joined
Methody!"
"Which
in
no
respect
prevents
you
from
being
at
the
same
time
a
drunkard
and
a
swindler.
I
saw
you
one
night
a
week
ago
laid
dead
