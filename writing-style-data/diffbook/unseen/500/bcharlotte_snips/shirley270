would
give
her
greater
pleasure
than
to
have
Caroline's
company
to
tea,
and
the
good
lady
added,
she
was
quite
sure
such
a
change
would
be
most
acceptable
and
beneficial
to
Caroline,
who
must
be
sadly
at
a
loss
both
for
safe
guidance
and
improving
society
since
the
misunderstanding
between
Robert
and
Mr.
Helstone
had
occasioned
a
separation
from
her
"meilleure
amie,
Hortense
Gerard
Moore."
In
a
postscript
she
was
urged
to
put
on
her
bonnet
and
run
down
directly.
Caroline
did
not
need
the
injunction.
Glad
was
she
to
lay
by
the
brown
holland
child's
slip
she
was
trimming
with
braid
for
the
Jew's
basket,
to
hasten
upstairs,
cover
her
curls
with
her
straw
bonnet,
and
throw
round
her
shoulders
the
black
silk
scarf,
whose
simple
drapery
suited
as
well
her
shape
as
its
dark
hue
set
off
the
purity
of
her
dress
and
the
fairness
of
her
face;
glad
was
she
to
escape
for
a
few
hours
the
solitude,
the
sadness,
the
nightmare
of
her
life;
glad
to
run
down
the
green
lane
sloping
to
the
Hollow,
to
scent
the
fragrance
of
hedge
flowers
sweeter
than
the
perfume
of
moss
rose
or
lily.
True,
she
knew
Robert
was
not
at
the
cottage;
but
it
was
delight
to
go
where
he
had
lately
been.
So
long,
so
totally
separated
from
him,
merely
to
see
his
home,
to
enter
the
room
where
he
had
that
morning
sat,
felt
like
a
reunion.
As
such
it
revived
her;
and
then
Illusion
was
again
following
her
in
Peri
mask.
The
soft
agitation
of
wings
caressed
her
cheek,
and
the
air,
breathing
from
the
blue
summer
sky,
bore
a
voice
which
whispered,
"Robert
may
come
home
while
you
are
in
his
house,
and
then,
at
least,
you
may
look
in
his
face
at
least
you
may
give
him
your
hand;
perhaps,
for
a
minute,
you
may
sit
beside
him."
"Silence!"
was
her
austere
response;
but
she
loved
the
comforter
and
the
consolation.
Miss
Moore
probably
caught
from
the
window
the
gleam
and
flutter
of
Caroline's
white
attire
through
the
branchy
garden
shrubs,
for
she
advanced
from
the
cottage
porch
to
meet
her.
Straight,
unbending,
phlegmatic
as
usual,
she
came
on.
No
haste
or
ecstasy
was
ever
permitted
to
disorder
the
dignity
of
her
movements;
but
she
smiled,
well
pleased
to
mark
the
delight
of
her
pupil,
to
feel
her
kiss
and
the
gentle,
genial
strain
of
her
embrace.
She
led
her
tenderly
in,
half
deceived
and
wholly
flattered.
Half
deceived!
had
it
not
been
so
she
would
in
all
probability
have
put
her
to
the
wicket,
and
shut
her
out.
Had
she
known
clearly
to
whose
account
the
chief
share
of
this
childlike
joy
was
to
be
placed,
Hortense
would
most
likely
have
felt
both
shocked
and
incensed.
Sisters
do
not
like
young
ladies
to
fall
in
love
with
their
brothers.
It
seems,
if
not
presumptuous,
silly,
weak,
a
delusion,
an
absurd
mistake.
They
do
not
love
these
gentlemen
whatever
sisterly
affection
they
may
