we
hear
in
solitude
told
me
all
I
know
on
these
subjects."
"Do
you
like
characters
of
the
Rousseau
order,
Caroline?"
"Not
at
all,
as
a
whole.
I
sympathize
intensely
with
certain
qualities
they
possess.
Certain
divine
sparks
in
their
nature
dazzle
my
eyes,
and
make
my
soul
glow.
Then,
again,
I
scorn
them.
They
are
made
of
clay
and
gold.
The
refuse
and
the
ore
make
a
mass
of
weakness:
taken
altogether,
I
feel
them
unnatural,
unhealthy,
repulsive."
"I
dare
say
I
should
be
more
tolerant
of
a
Rousseau
than
you
would,
Cary.
Submissive
and
contemplative
yourself,
you
like
the
stern
and
the
practical.
By
the
way,
you
must
miss
that
Cousin
Robert
of
yours
very
much,
now
that
you
and
he
never
meet."
"I
do."
"And
he
must
miss
you?"
"That
he
does
not."
"I
cannot
imagine,"
pursued
Shirley,
who
had
lately
got
a
habit
of
introducing
Moore's
name
into
the
conversation,
even
when
it
seemed
to
have
no
business
there
"I
cannot
imagine
but
that
he
was
fond
of
you,
since
he
took
so
much
notice
of
you,
talked
to
you,
and
taught
you
so
much."
"He
never
was
fond
of
me;
he
never
professed
to
be
fond
of
me.
He
took
pains
to
prove
that
he
only
just
tolerated
me."
Caroline,
determined
not
to
err
on
the
flattering
side
in
estimating
her
cousin's
regard
for
her,
always
now
habitually
thought
of
it
and
mentioned
it
in
the
most
scanty
measure.
She
had
her
own
reasons
for
being
less
sanguine
than
ever
in
hopeful
views
of
the
future,
less
indulgent
to
pleasurable
retrospections
of
the
past.
"Of
course,
then,"
observed
Miss
Keeldar,
"you
only
just
tolerated
him
in
return?"
"Shirley,
men
and
women
are
so
different;
they
are
in
such
a
different
position.
Women
have
so
few
things
to
think
about,
men
so
many.
You
may
have
a
friendship
for
a
man,
while
he
is
almost
indifferent
to
you.
Much
of
what
cheers
your
life
may
be
dependent
on
him,
while
not
a
feeling
or
interest
of
moment
in
his
eyes
may
have
reference
to
you.
Robert
used
to
be
in
the
habit
of
going
to
London,
sometimes
for
a
week
or
a
fortnight
together.
Well,
while
he
was
away,
I
found
his
absence
a
void.
There
was
something
wanting;
Briarfield
was
duller.
Of
course,
I
had
my
usual
occupations;
still
I
missed
him.
As
I
sat
by
myself
in
the
evenings,
I
used
to
feel
a
strange
certainty
of
conviction
I
cannot
describe,
that
if
a
magician
or
a
genius
had,
at
that
moment,
offered
me
Prince
Ali's
tube
(you
remember
it
in
the
'Arabian
Nights'?),
and
if,
with
its
aid,
I
had
been
enabled
to
take
a
view
of
Robert
to
see
where
he
was,
how
occupied
I
should
have
learned,
in
a
startling
manner,
the
width
of
the
chasm
which
gaped
between
such
as
he
and
such
as
I.
I
knew
that,
however
my
thoughts
might
adhere
to
him,
his
were
effectually
sundered
from
