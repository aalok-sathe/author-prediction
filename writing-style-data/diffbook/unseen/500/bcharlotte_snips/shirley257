ere
long
to
produce
mortal
effects
on
my
constitution.
I
sickened.
The
lady
of
the
house
told
me
coolly
I
was
the
victim
of
'wounded
vanity.'
She
hinted
that
if
I
did
not
make
an
effort
to
quell
my
'ungodly
discontent,'
to
cease
'murmuring
against
God's
appointment,'
and
to
cultivate
the
profound
humility
befitting
my
station,
my
mind
would
very
likely
'go
to
pieces'
on
the
rock
that
wrecked
most
of
my
sisterhood
morbid
self
esteem
and
that
I
should
die
an
inmate
of
a
lunatic
asylum.
"I
said
nothing
to
Mrs.
Hardman
it
would
have
been
useless;
but
to
her
eldest
daughter
I
one
day
dropped
a
few
observations,
which
were
answered
thus.
There
were
hardships,
she
allowed,
in
the
position
of
a
governess.
'Doubtless
they
had
their
trials;
but,'
she
averred,
with
a
manner
it
makes
me
smile
now
to
recall
'but
it
must
be
so.
She'
(Miss
H.)
'had
neither
view,
hope,
nor
wish
to
see
these
things
remedied;
for
in
the
inherent
constitution
of
English
habits,
feelings,
and
prejudices
there
was
no
possibility
that
they
should
be.
Governesses,'
she
observed,
'must
ever
be
kept
in
a
sort
of
isolation.
It
is
the
only
means
of
maintaining
that
distance
which
the
reserve
of
English
manners
and
the
decorum
of
English
families
exact.'
"I
remember
I
sighed
as
Miss
Hardman
quitted
my
bedside.
She
caught
the
sound,
and
turning,
said
severely,
'I
fear,
Miss
Grey,
you
have
inherited
in
fullest
measure
the
worst
sin
of
our
fallen
nature
the
sin
of
pride.
You
are
proud,
and
therefore
you
are
ungrateful
too.
Mamma
pays
you
a
handsome
salary,
and
if
you
had
average
sense
you
would
thankfully
put
up
with
much
that
is
fatiguing
to
do
and
irksome
to
bear,
since
it
is
so
well
made
worth
your
while.'
"Miss
Hardman,
my
love,
was
a
very
strong
minded
young
lady,
of
most
distinguished
talents.
The
aristocracy
are
decidedly
a
very
superior
class,
you
know,
both
physically,
and
morally,
and
mentally;
as
a
high
Tory
I
acknowledge
that.
I
could
not
describe
the
dignity
of
her
voice
and
mien
as
she
addressed
me
thus;
still,
I
fear
she
was
selfish,
my
dear.
I
would
never
wish
to
speak
ill
of
my
superiors
in
rank,
but
I
think
she
was
a
little
selfish."
"I
remember,"
continued
Mrs.
Pryor,
after
a
pause,
"another
of
Miss
H.'s
observations,
which
she
would
utter
with
quite
a
grand
air.
'WE,'
she
would
say
'WE
need
the
imprudences,
extravagances,
mistakes,
and
crimes
of
a
certain
number
of
fathers
to
sow
the
seed
from
which
WE
reap
the
harvest
of
governesses.
The
daughters
of
trades
people,
however
well
educated,
must
necessarily
be
underbred,
and
as
such
unfit
to
be
inmates
of
OUR
dwellings,
or
guardians
of
OUR
children's
minds
and
persons.
WE
shall
ever
prefer
to
place
those
about
OUR
offspring
who
have
been
born
and
bred
with
somewhat
of
the
same
refinement
as
OURSELVES.'"
"Miss
Hardman
must
have
thought
herself
something
better
than
her
fellow
creatures,
