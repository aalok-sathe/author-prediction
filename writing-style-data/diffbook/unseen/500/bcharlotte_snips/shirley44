of
your
mill
chances
to
come
into
the
kitchen
and
find
me
in
my
jupon
and
camisole
preparing
dinner
(for
you
know
I
cannot
trust
Sarah
to
cook
a
single
dish),
she
sneers.
If
I
accept
an
invitation
out
to
tea,
which
I
have
done
once
or
twice,
I
perceive
I
am
put
quite
into
the
background;
I
have
not
that
attention
paid
me
which
decidedly
is
my
due.
Of
what
an
excellent
family
are
the
Gerards,
as
we
know,
and
the
Moores
also!
They
have
a
right
to
claim
a
certain
respect,
and
to
feel
wounded
when
it
is
withheld
from
them.
In
Antwerp
I
was
always
treated
with
distinction;
here,
one
would
think
that
when
I
open
my
lips
in
company
I
speak
English
with
a
ridiculous
accent,
whereas
I
am
quite
assured
that
I
pronounce
it
perfectly."
"Hortense,
in
Antwerp
we
were
known
rich;
in
England
we
were
never
known
but
poor."
"Precisely,
and
thus
mercenary
are
mankind.
Again,
dear
brother,
last
Sunday,
if
you
recollect,
was
very
wet;
accordingly
I
went
to
church
in
my
neat
black
sabots,
objects
one
would
not
indeed
wear
in
a
fashionable
city,
but
which
in
the
country
I
have
ever
been
accustomed
to
use
for
walking
in
dirty
roads.
Believe
me,
as
I
paced
up
the
aisle,
composed
and
tranquil,
as
I
am
always,
four
ladies,
and
as
many
gentlemen,
laughed
and
hid
their
faces
behind
their
prayer
books."
"Well,
well!
don't
put
on
the
sabots
again.
I
told
you
before
I
thought
they
were
not
quite
the
thing
for
this
country."
"But,
brother,
they
are
not
common
sabots,
such
as
the
peasantry
wear.
I
tell
you,
they
are
sabots
noirs,
tres
propres,
tres
convenables.
At
Mons
and
Leuze
cities
not
very
far
removed
from
the
elegant
capital
of
Brussels
it
is
very
seldom
that
the
respectable
people
wear
anything
else
for
walking
in
winter.
Let
any
one
try
to
wade
the
mud
of
the
Flemish
chaussees
in
a
pair
of
Paris
brodequins,
on
m'en
dirait
des
nouvelles!"
"Never
mind
Mons
and
Leuze
and
the
Flemish
chaussees;
do
at
Rome
as
the
Romans
do.
And
as
to
the
camisole
and
jupon,
I
am
not
quite
sure
about
them
either.
I
never
see
an
English
lady
dressed
in
such
garments.
Ask
Caroline
Helstone."
"Caroline!
I
ask
Caroline?
I
consult
her
about
my
dress?
It
is
she
who
on
all
points
should
consult
me.
She
is
a
child."
"She
is
eighteen,
or
at
least
seventeen
old
enough
to
know
all
about
gowns,
petticoats,
and
chaussures."
"Do
not
spoil
Caroline,
I
entreat
you,
brother.
Do
not
make
her
of
more
consequence
than
she
ought
to
be.
At
present
she
is
modest
and
unassuming:
let
us
keep
her
so."
"With
all
my
heart.
Is
she
coming
this
morning?"
"She
will
come
at
ten,
as
usual,
to
take
her
French
lesson."
"You
don't
find
that
she
sneers
at
you,
do
you?"
"She
does
not.
She
appreciates
me
better
than
any
one
else
here;
but
then
