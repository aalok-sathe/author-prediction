pardon
with
proper
submission.
Ere
long
she
was
still.
I
saw
her
smiling
to
herself
over
the
book.
She
began
to
learn
assiduously.
In
half
an
hour
she
came
and
stood
before
me,
presented
the
volume,
folded
her
hands,
as
I
always
require
her
to
do,
and
commenced
the
repetition
of
that
short
thing
by
Chenier,
'La
Jeune
Captive.'
If
you
had
heard
the
manner
in
which
she
went
through
this,
and
in
which
she
uttered
a
few
incoherent
comments
when
she
had
done,
you
would
have
known
what
I
meant
by
the
phrase
'unsettled
hurry.'
One
would
have
thought
Chenier
was
more
moving
than
all
Racine
and
all
Corneille.
You,
brother,
who
have
so
much
sagacity,
will
discern
that
this
disproportionate
preference
argues
an
ill
regulated
mind;
but
she
is
fortunate
in
her
preceptress.
I
will
give
her
a
system,
a
method
of
thought,
a
set
of
opinions;
I
will
give
her
the
perfect
control
and
guidance
of
her
feelings."
"Be
sure
you
do,
Hortense.
Here
she
comes.
That
was
her
shadow
passed
the
window,
I
believe."
"Ah!
truly.
She
is
too
early
half
an
hour
before
her
time.
My
child,
what
brings
you
here
before
I
have
breakfasted?"
This
question
was
addressed
to
an
individual
who
now
entered
the
room,
a
young
girl,
wrapped
in
a
winter
mantle,
the
folds
of
which
were
gathered
with
some
grace
round
an
apparently
slender
figure.
"I
came
in
haste
to
see
how
you
were,
Hortense,
and
how
Robert
was
too.
I
was
sure
you
would
be
both
grieved
by
what
happened
last
night.
I
did
not
hear
till
this
morning.
My
uncle
told
me
at
breakfast."
"Ah!
it
is
unspeakable.
You
sympathize
with
us?
Your
uncle
sympathizes
with
us?"
"My
uncle
is
very
angry
but
he
was
with
Robert,
I
believe,
was
he
not?
Did
he
not
go
with
you
to
Stilbro'
Moor?"
"Yes,
we
set
out
in
very
martial
style,
Caroline;
but
the
prisoners
we
went
to
rescue
met
us
half
way."
"Of
course
nobody
was
hurt?"
"Why,
no;
only
Joe
Scott's
wrists
were
a
little
galled
with
being
pinioned
too
tightly
behind
his
back."
"You
were
not
there?
You
were
not
with
the
wagons
when
they
were
attacked?"
"No.
One
seldom
has
the
fortune
to
be
present
at
occurrences
at
which
one
would
particularly
wish
to
assist."
"Where
are
you
going
this
morning?
I
saw
Murgatroyd
saddling
your
horse
in
the
yard."
"To
Whinbury.
It
is
market
day."
"Mr.
Yorke
is
going
too.
I
met
him
in
his
gig.
Come
home
with
him."
"Why?"
"Two
are
better
than
one,
and
nobody
dislikes
Mr.
Yorke
at
least,
poor
people
do
not
dislike
him."
"Therefore
he
would
be
a
protection
to
me,
who
am
hated?"
"Who
are
misunderstood.
That,
probably,
is
the
word.
Shall
you
be
late?
Will
he
be
late,
Cousin
Hortense?"
"It
is
too
probable.
He
has
often
much
business
to
transact
at
Whinbury.
Have
you
brought
your
exercise
book,
child?"
"Yes.
What
time
will
you
return,
Robert?"
"I
