other
they
tire
of
each
other
in
a
month.
A
yokefellow
is
not
a
companion;
he
or
she
is
a
fellow
sufferer."
It
was
by
no
means
naive
simplicity
which
inspired
Caroline's
next
remark;
it
was
a
sense
of
antipathy
to
such
opinions,
and
of
displeasure
at
him
who
held
them.
"One
would
think
you
had
never
been
married,
uncle.
One
would
think
you
were
an
old
bachelor."
"Practically,
I
am
so."
"But
you
have
been
married.
Why
were
you
so
inconsistent
as
to
marry?"
"Every
man
is
mad
once
or
twice
in
his
life."
"So
you
tired
of
my
aunt,
and
my
aunt
of
you,
and
you
were
miserable
together?"
Mr.
Helstone
pushed
out
his
cynical
lip,
wrinkled
his
brown
forehead,
and
gave
an
inarticulate
grunt.
"Did
she
not
suit
you?
Was
she
not
good
tempered?
Did
you
not
get
used
to
her?
Were
you
not
sorry
when
she
died?"
"Caroline,"
said
Mr.
Helstone,
bringing
his
hand
slowly
down
to
within
an
inch
or
two
of
the
table,
and
then
smiting
it
suddenly
on
the
mahogany,
"understand
this:
it
is
vulgar
and
puerile
to
confound
generals
with
particulars.
In
every
case
there
is
the
rule
and
there
are
the
exceptions.
Your
questions
are
stupid
and
babyish.
Ring
the
bell,
if
you
have
done
breakfast."
The
breakfast
was
taken
away,
and
that
meal
over,
it
was
the
general
custom
of
uncle
and
niece
to
separate,
and
not
to
meet
again
till
dinner;
but
to
day
the
niece,
instead
of
quitting
the
room,
went
to
the
window
seat,
and
sat
down
there.
Mr.
Helstone
looked
round
uneasily
once
or
twice,
as
if
he
wished
her
away;
but
she
was
gazing
from
the
window,
and
did
not
seem
to
mind
him:
so
he
continued
the
perusal
of
his
morning
paper
a
particularly
interesting
one
it
chanced
to
be,
as
new
movements
had
just
taken
place
in
the
Peninsula,
and
certain
columns
of
the
journal
were
rich
in
long
dispatches
from
General
Lord
Wellington.
He
little
knew,
meantime,
what
thoughts
were
busy
in
his
niece's
mind
thoughts
the
conversation
of
the
past
half
hour
had
revived
but
not
generated;
tumultuous
were
they
now,
as
disturbed
bees
in
a
hive,
but
it
was
years
since
they
had
first
made
their
cells
in
her
brain.
She
was
reviewing
his
character,
his
disposition,
repeating
his
sentiments
on
marriage.
Many
a
time
had
she
reviewed
them
before,
and
sounded
the
gulf
between
her
own
mind
and
his;
and
then,
on
the
other
side
of
the
wide
and
deep
chasm,
she
had
seen,
and
she
now
saw,
another
figure
standing
beside
her
uncle's
a
strange
shape,
dim,
sinister,
scarcely
earthly
the
half
remembered
image
of
her
own
father,
James
Helstone,
Matthewson
Helstone's
brother.
Rumours
had
reached
her
ear
of
what
that
father's
character
was;
old
servants
had
dropped
hints;
she
knew,
too,
that
he
was
not
a
good
man,
and
that
he
was
never
kind
to
her.
She
recollected
a
dark
recollection
it
was
some
weeks
that
she
