speeches,
recommendation
to
be
careful
of
the
night
air,
etc.
By
degrees
the
throng
dispersed,
the
carriages
drove
off.
Miss
Keeldar
was
just
emerging
from
her
flowery
refuge
when
Mr.
Helstone
entered
the
garden
and
met
her.
"Oh,
I
want
you!"
he
said.
"I
was
afraid
you
were
already
gone.
Caroline,
come
here."
Caroline
came,
expecting,
as
Shirley
did,
a
lecture
on
not
having
been
visible
at
church.
Other
subjects,
however,
occupied
the
rector's
mind.
"I
shall
not
sleep
at
home
to
night,"
he
continued.
"I
have
just
met
with
an
old
friend,
and
promised
to
accompany
him.
I
shall
return
probably
about
noon
to
morrow.
Thomas,
the
clerk,
is
engaged,
and
I
cannot
get
him
to
sleep
in
the
house,
as
I
usually
do
when
I
am
absent
for
a
night.
Now
"
"Now,"
interrupted
Shirley,
"you
want
me
as
a
gentleman
the
first
gentleman
in
Briarfield,
in
short
to
supply
your
place,
be
master
of
the
rectory
and
guardian
of
your
niece
and
maids
while
you
are
away?"
"Exactly,
captain.
I
thought
the
post
would
suit
you.
Will
you
favour
Caroline
so
far
as
to
be
her
guest
for
one
night?
Will
you
stay
here
instead
of
going
back
to
Fieldhead?"
"And
what
will
Mrs.
Pryor
do?
she
expects
me
home."
"I
will
send
her
word.
Come,
make
up
your
mind
to
stay.
It
grows
late;
the
dew
falls
heavily.
You
and
Caroline
will
enjoy
each
other's
society,
I
doubt
not."
"I
promise
you,
then,
to
stay
with
Caroline,"
replied
Shirley.
"As
you
say,
we
shall
enjoy
each
other's
society.
We
will
not
be
separated
to
night.
Now,
rejoin
your
old
friend,
and
fear
nothing
for
us."
"If
there
should
chance
to
be
any
disturbance
in
the
night,
captain;
if
you
should
hear
the
picking
of
a
lock,
the
cutting
out
of
a
pane
of
glass,
a
stealthy
tread
of
steps
about
the
house
(and
I
need
not
fear
to
tell
you,
who
bear
a
well
tempered,
mettlesome
heart
under
your
girl's
ribbon
sash,
that
such
little
incidents
are
very
possible
in
the
present
time),
what
would
you
do?"
"Don't
know;
faint,
perhaps
fall
down,
and
have
to
be
picked
up
again.
But,
doctor,
if
you
assign
me
the
post
of
honour,
you
must
give
me
arms.
What
weapons
are
there
in
your
stronghold?"
"You
could
not
wield
a
sword?"
"No;
I
could
manage
the
carving
knife
better."
"You
will
find
a
good
one
in
the
dining
room
sideboard
a
lady's
knife,
light
to
handle,
and
as
sharp
pointed
as
a
poniard."
"It
will
suit
Caroline.
But
you
must
give
me
a
brace
of
pistols.
I
know
you
have
pistols."
"I
have
two
pairs.
One
pair
I
can
place
at
your
disposal.
You
will
find
them
suspended
over
the
mantelpiece
of
my
study
in
cloth
cases."
"Loaded?"
"Yes,
but
not
on
the
cock.
Cock
them
before
you
go
to
bed.
It
is
paying
you
a
great
compliment,
captain,
to
lend
you
these.
Were
you
one
of
the
awkward
