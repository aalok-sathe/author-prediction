commonplace
profligacy.
Accept
that
as
the
first
reason
why
I
spurn
him."
"Miss
Keeldar,
you
shock
me!"
"That
conduct
alone
sinks
him
in
a
gulf
of
immeasurable
inferiority.
His
intellect
reaches
no
standard
I
can
esteem:
there
is
a
second
stumbling
block.
His
views
are
narrow,
his
feelings
are
blunt,
his
tastes
are
coarse,
his
manners
vulgar."
"The
man
is
a
respectable,
wealthy
man!
To
refuse
him
is
presumption
on
your
part."
"I
refuse
point
blank!
Cease
to
annoy
me
with
the
subject;
I
forbid
it!"
"Is
it
your
intention
ever
to
marry;
or
do
you
prefer
celibacy?"
"I
deny
your
right
to
claim
an
answer
to
that
question."
"May
I
ask
if
you
expect
some
man
of
title
some
peer
of
the
realm
to
demand
your
hand?"
"I
doubt
if
the
peer
breathes
on
whom
I
would
confer
it."
"Were
there
insanity
in
the
family,
I
should
believe
you
mad.
Your
eccentricity
and
conceit
touch
the
verge
of
frenzy."
"Perhaps,
ere
I
have
finished,
you
will
see
me
over
leap
it."
"I
anticipate
no
less.
Frantic
and
impracticable
girl!
Take
warning!
I
dare
you
to
sully
our
name
by
a
mesalliance!"
"Our
name!
Am
I
called
Sympson?"
"God
be
thanked
that
you
are
not!
But
be
on
your
guard;
I
will
not
be
trifled
with!"
"What,
in
the
name
of
common
law
and
common
sense,
would
you
or
could
you
do
if
my
pleasure
led
me
to
a
choice
you
disapproved?"
"Take
care!
take
care!"
warning
her
with
voice
and
hand
that
trembled
alike.
"Why?
What
shadow
of
power
have
you
over
me?
Why
should
I
fear
you?"
"Take
care,
madam!"
"Scrupulous
care
I
will
take,
Mr.
Sympson.
Before
I
marry
I
am
resolved
to
esteem
to
admire
to
love."
"Preposterous
stuff!
indecorous,
unwomanly!"
"To
love
with
my
whole
heart.
I
know
I
speak
in
an
unknown
tongue;
but
I
feel
indifferent
whether
I
am
comprehended
or
not."
"And
if
this
love
of
yours
should
fall
on
a
beggar?"
"On
a
beggar
it
will
never
fall.
Mendicancy
is
not
estimable."
"On
a
low
clerk,
a
play
actor,
a
play
writer,
or
or
"
"Take
courage,
Mr.
Sympson!
Or
what?"
"Any
literary
scrub,
or
shabby,
whining
artist."
"For
the
scrubby,
shabby,
whining
I
have
no
taste;
for
literature
and
the
arts
I
have.
And
there
I
wonder
how
your
Fawthrop
Wynne
would
suit
me.
He
cannot
write
a
note
without
orthographical
errors;
he
reads
only
a
sporting
paper;
he
was
the
booby
of
Stilbro'
grammar
school!"
"Unladylike
language!
Great
God!
to
what
will
she
come?"
He
lifted
hands
and
eyes.
"Never
to
the
altar
of
Hymen
with
Sam
Wynne."
"To
what
will
she
come?
Why
are
not
the
laws
more
stringent,
that
I
might
compel
her
to
hear
reason?"
"Console
yourself,
uncle.
Were
Britain
a
serfdom
and
you
the
Czar,
you
could
not
compel
me
to
this
step.
I
will
write
to
Mr.
Wynne.
Give
yourself
no
further
trouble
on
the
subject."
