his
frame
laden
wagons.
Malone's
coming
and
company
were,
it
may
be,
most
unwelcome
to
him.
He
would
have
preferred
sitting
alone;
for
he
liked
a
silent,
sombre,
unsafe
solitude.
His
watchman's
musket
would
have
been
company
enough
for
him;
the
full
flowing
beck
in
the
den
would
have
delivered
continuously
the
discourse
most
genial
to
his
ear.
With
the
queerest
look
in
the
world
had
the
manufacturer
for
some
ten
minutes
been
watching
the
Irish
curate,
as
the
latter
made
free
with
the
punch,
when
suddenly
that
steady
gray
eye
changed,
as
if
another
vision
came
between
it
and
Malone.
Moore
raised
his
hand.
"Chut!"
he
said
in
his
French
fashion,
as
Malone
made
a
noise
with
his
glass.
He
listened
a
moment,
then
rose,
put
his
hat
on,
and
went
out
at
the
counting
house
door.
The
night
was
still,
dark,
and
stagnant:
the
water
yet
rushed
on
full
and
fast;
its
flow
almost
seemed
a
flood
in
the
utter
silence.
Moore's
ear,
however,
caught
another
sound,
very
distant
but
yet
dissimilar,
broken
and
rugged
in
short,
a
sound
of
heavy
wheels
crunching
a
stony
road.
He
returned
to
the
counting
house
and
lit
a
lantern,
with
which
he
walked
down
the
mill
yard,
and
proceeded
to
open
the
gates.
The
big
wagons
were
coming
on;
the
dray
horses'
huge
hoofs
were
heard
splashing
in
the
mud
and
water.
Moore
hailed
them.
"Hey,
Joe
Scott!
Is
all
right?"
Probably
Joe
Scott
was
yet
at
too
great
a
distance
to
hear
the
inquiry.
He
did
not
answer
it.
"Is
all
right,
I
say?"
again
asked
Moore,
when
the
elephant
like
leader's
nose
almost
touched
his.
Some
one
jumped
out
from
the
foremost
wagon
into
the
road;
a
voice
cried
aloud,
"Ay,
ay,
divil;
all's
raight!
We've
smashed
'em."
And
there
was
a
run.
The
wagons
stood
still;
they
were
now
deserted.
"Joe
Scott!"
No
Joe
Scott
answered.
"Murgatroyd!
Pighills!
Sykes!"
No
reply.
Mr.
Moore
lifted
his
lantern
and
looked
into
the
vehicles.
There
was
neither
man
nor
machinery;
they
were
empty
and
abandoned.
Now
Mr.
Moore
loved
his
machinery.
He
had
risked
the
last
of
his
capital
on
the
purchase
of
these
frames
and
shears
which
to
night
had
been
expected.
Speculations
most
important
to
his
interests
depended
on
the
results
to
be
wrought
by
them.
Where
were
they?
The
words
"we've
smashed
'em"
rang
in
his
ears.
How
did
the
catastrophe
affect
him?
By
the
light
of
the
lantern
he
held
were
his
features
visible,
relaxing
to
a
singular
smile
the
smile
the
man
of
determined
spirit
wears
when
he
reaches
a
juncture
in
his
life
where
this
determined
spirit
is
to
feel
a
demand
on
its
strength,
when
the
strain
is
to
be
made,
and
the
faculty
must
bear
or
break.
Yet
he
remained
silent,
and
even
motionless;
for
at
the
instant
he
neither
knew
what
to
say
nor
what
to
do.
He
placed
the
lantern
on
the
ground,
and
stood
with
his
arms
folded,
gazing
down
