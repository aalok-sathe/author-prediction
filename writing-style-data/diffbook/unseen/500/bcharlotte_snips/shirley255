compared
its
aspect
with
that
of
other
parts
of
England,
revealing
in
quiet,
unconscious
touches
of
description
a
sense
of
the
picturesque,
an
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
or
commonplace,
a
power
of
comparing
the
wild
with
the
cultured,
the
grand
with
the
tame,
that
gave
to
her
discourse
a
graphic
charm
as
pleasant
as
it
was
unpretending.
The
sort
of
reverent
pleasure
with
which
Caroline
listened
so
sincere,
so
quiet,
yet
so
evident
stirred
the
elder
lady's
faculties
to
gentle
animation.
Rarely,
probably,
had
she,
with
her
chill,
repellent
outside,
her
diffident
mien,
and
incommunicative
habits,
known
what
it
was
to
excite
in
one
whom
she
herself
could
love
feelings
of
earnest
affection
and
admiring
esteem.
Delightful,
doubtless,
was
the
consciousness
that
a
young
girl
towards
whom
it
seemed,
judging
by
the
moved
expression
of
her
eyes
and
features,
her
heart
turned
with
almost
a
fond
impulse,
looked
up
to
her
as
an
instructor,
and
clung
to
her
as
a
friend.
With
a
somewhat
more
marked
accent
of
interest
than
she
often
permitted
herself
to
use,
she
said,
as
she
bent
towards
her
youthful
companion,
and
put
aside
from
her
forehead
a
pale
brown
curl
which
had
strayed
from
the
confining
comb,
"I
do
hope
this
sweet
air
blowing
from
the
hill
will
do
you
good,
my
dear
Caroline.
I
wish
I
could
see
something
more
of
colour
in
these
cheeks;
but
perhaps
you
were
never
florid?"
"I
had
red
cheeks
once,"
returned
Miss
Helstone,
smiling.
"I
remember
a
year
two
years
ago
when
I
used
to
look
in
the
glass,
I
saw
a
different
face
there
to
what
I
see
now
rounder
and
rosier.
But
when
we
are
young,"
added
the
girl
of
eighteen,
"our
minds
are
careless
and
our
lives
easy."
"Do
you,"
continued
Mrs.
Pryor,
mastering
by
an
effort
that
tyrant
timidity
which
made
it
difficult
for
her,
even
under
present
circumstances,
to
attempt
the
scrutiny
of
another's
heart
"do
you,
at
your
age,
fret
yourself
with
cares
for
the
future?
Believe
me,
you
had
better
not.
Let
the
morrow
take
thought
for
the
things
of
itself."
"True,
dear
madam.
It
is
not
over
the
future
I
pine.
The
evil
of
the
day
is
sometimes
oppressive
too
oppressive
and
I
long
to
escape
it."
"That
is
the
evil
of
the
day
that
is
your
uncle
perhaps
is
not
you
find
it
difficult
to
understand
he
does
not
appreciate
"
Mrs.
Pryor
could
not
complete
her
broken
sentences;
she
could
not
manage
to
put
the
question
whether
Mr.
Helstone
was
too
harsh
with
his
niece.
But
Caroline
comprehended.
"Oh,
that
is
nothing,"
she
replied.
"My
uncle
and
I
get
on
very
well.
We
never
quarrel
I
don't
call
him
harsh
he
never
scolds
me.
Sometimes
I
wish
somebody
in
the
world
loved
me,
but
I
cannot
say
that
I
particularly
wish
him
to
have
more
affection
for
me
than
he
has.
As
a
child,
I
should
perhaps
have
felt
the
want
of
attention,
only
the
servants
were
very
