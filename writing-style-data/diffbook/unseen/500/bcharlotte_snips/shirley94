talking
under
their
breath
to
each
other.
At
length
one
of
them
approached.
This
man
looked
very
different
from
either
of
the
two
who
had
previously
spoken;
he
was
hard
favoured,
but
modest
and
manly
looking.
"I've
not
much
faith
i'
Moses
Barraclough,"
said
he,
"and
I
would
speak
a
word
to
you
myseln,
Mr.
Moore.
It's
out
o'
no
ill
will
that
I'm
here,
for
my
part;
it's
just
to
mak
a
effort
to
get
things
straightened,
for
they're
sorely
a
crooked.
Ye
see
we're
ill
off
varry
ill
off;
wer
families
is
poor
and
pined.
We're
thrown
out
o'
work
wi'
these
frames;
we
can
get
nought
to
do;
we
can
earn
nought.
What
is
to
be
done?
Mun
we
say,
wisht!
and
lig
us
down
and
dee?
Nay;
I've
no
grand
words
at
my
tongue's
end,
Mr.
Moore,
but
I
feel
that
it
wad
be
a
low
principle
for
a
reasonable
man
to
starve
to
death
like
a
dumb
cratur.
I
willn't
do't.
I'm
not
for
shedding
blood:
I'd
neither
kill
a
man
nor
hurt
a
man;
and
I'm
not
for
pulling
down
mills
and
breaking
machines
for,
as
ye
say,
that
way
o'
going
on'll
niver
stop
invention;
but
I'll
talk
I'll
mak
as
big
a
din
as
ever
I
can.
Invention
may
be
all
right,
but
I
know
it
isn't
right
for
poor
folks
to
starve.
Them
that
governs
mun
find
a
way
to
help
us;
they
mun
make
fresh
orderations.
Ye'll
say
that's
hard
to
do.
So
mich
louder
mun
we
shout
out
then,
for
so
much
slacker
will
t'
Parliament
men
be
to
set
on
to
a
tough
job."
"Worry
the
Parliament
men
as
much
as
you
please,"
said
Moore;
"but
to
worry
the
mill
owners
is
absurd,
and
I
for
one
won't
stand
it."
"Ye're
a
raight
hard
un!"
returned
the
workman.
"Willn't
ye
gie
us
a
bit
o'
time?
Willn't
ye
consent
to
mak
your
changes
rather
more
slowly?"
"Am
I
the
whole
body
of
clothiers
in
Yorkshire?
Answer
me
that."
"Ye're
yourseln."
"And
only
myself.
And
if
I
stopped
by
the
way
an
instant,
while
others
are
rushing
on,
I
should
be
trodden
down.
If
I
did
as
you
wish
me
to
do,
I
should
be
bankrupt
in
a
month;
and
would
my
bankruptcy
put
bread
into
your
hungry
children's
mouths?
William
Farren,
neither
to
your
dictation
nor
to
that
of
any
other
will
I
submit.
Talk
to
me
no
more
about
machinery.
I
will
have
my
own
way.
I
shall
get
new
frames
in
to
morrow.
If
you
broke
these,
I
would
still
get
more.
I'll
never
give
in."
Here
the
mill
bell
rang
twelve
o'clock.
It
was
the
dinner
hour.
Moore
abruptly
turned
from
the
deputation
and
re
entered
his
counting
house.
His
last
words
had
left
a
bad,
harsh
impression;
he,
at
least,
had
"failed
in
the
disposing
of
a
chance
he
was
lord
of."
By
speaking
kindly
to
William
Farren
who
was
a
very
honest
man,
