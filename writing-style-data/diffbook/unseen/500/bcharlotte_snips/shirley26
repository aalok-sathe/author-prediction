is
any
worse
than
bloody
republican
France?"
demanded
Helstone
fiercely.
"I
mean
to
say
nothing,
but
I
can
think
what
I
please,
you
know,
Mr.
Helstone,
both
about
France
and
England;
and
about
revolutions,
and
regicides,
and
restorations
in
general;
and
about
the
divine
right
of
kings,
which
you
often
stickle
for
in
your
sermons,
and
the
duty
of
non
resistance,
and
the
sanity
of
war,
and
"
Mr.
Moore's
sentence
was
here
cut
short
by
the
rapid
rolling
up
of
a
gig,
and
its
sudden
stoppage
in
the
middle
of
the
road.
Both
he
and
the
rector
had
been
too
much
occupied
with
their
discourse
to
notice
its
approach
till
it
was
close
upon
them.
"Nah,
maister;
did
th'
wagons
hit
home?"
demanded
a
voice
from
the
vehicle.
"Can
that
be
Joe
Scott?"
"Ay,
ay!"
returned
another
voice;
for
the
gig
contained
two
persons,
as
was
seen
by
the
glimmer
of
its
lamp.
The
men
with
the
lanterns
had
now
fallen
into
the
rear,
or
rather,
the
equestrians
of
the
rescue
party
had
outridden
the
pedestrians.
"Ay,
Mr.
Moore,
it's
Joe
Scott.
I'm
bringing
him
back
to
you
in
a
bonny
pickle.
I
fand
him
on
the
top
of
the
moor
yonder,
him
and
three
others.
What
will
you
give
me
for
restoring
him
to
you?"
"Why,
my
thanks,
I
believe;
for
I
could
better
have
afforded
to
lose
a
better
man.
That
is
you,
I
suppose,
Mr.
Yorke,
by
your
voice?"
"Ay,
lad,
it's
me.
I
was
coming
home
from
Stilbro'
market,
and
just
as
I
got
to
the
middle
of
the
moor,
and
was
whipping
on
as
swift
as
the
wind
(for
these,
they
say,
are
not
safe
times,
thanks
to
a
bad
government!),
I
heard
a
groan.
I
pulled
up.
Some
would
have
whipt
on
faster;
but
I've
naught
to
fear
that
I
know
of.
I
don't
believe
there's
a
lad
in
these
parts
would
harm
me
at
least,
I'd
give
them
as
good
as
I
got
if
they
offered
to
do
it.
I
said,
'Is
there
aught
wrong
anywhere?'
''Deed
is
there,'
somebody
says,
speaking
out
of
the
ground,
like.
'What's
to
do?
Be
sharp
and
tell
me,'
I
ordered.
'Nobbut
four
on
us
ligging
in
a
ditch,'
says
Joe,
as
quiet
as
could
be.
I
telled
'em
more
shame
to
'em,
and
bid
them
get
up
and
move
on,
or
I'd
lend
them
a
lick
of
the
gig
whip;
for
my
notion
was
they
were
all
fresh.
'We'd
ha'
done
that
an
hour
sin',
but
we're
teed
wi'
a
bit
o'
band,'
says
Joe.
So
in
a
while
I
got
down
and
loosed
'em
wi'
my
penknife;
and
Scott
would
ride
wi'
me,
to
tell
me
all
how
it
happened;
and
t'
others
are
coming
on
as
fast
as
their
feet
will
bring
them."
"Well,
I
am
greatly
obliged
to
you,
Mr.
Yorke."
"Are
you,
my
lad?
You
know
you're
not.
However,
here
are
the
rest
approaching.
And
here,
by
the
Lord,
is
another
