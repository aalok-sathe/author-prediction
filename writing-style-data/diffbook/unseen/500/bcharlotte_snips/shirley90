sister
and
his
cousin
so
suave
to
one,
so
tender
to
the
other
reading
Shakespeare
and
listening
to
Chenier?
Yes,
it
was
the
same
man,
only
seen
on
a
different
side
a
side
Caroline
had
not
yet
fairly
beheld,
though
perhaps
she
had
enough
sagacity
faintly
to
suspect
its
existence.
Well,
Caroline
had,
doubtless,
her
defective
side
too.
She
was
human.
She
must,
then,
have
been
very
imperfect;
and
had
she
seen
Moore
on
his
very
worst
side,
she
would
probably
have
said
this
to
herself
and
excused
him.
Love
can
excuse
anything
except
meanness;
but
meanness
kills
love,
cripples
even
natural
affection;
without
esteem
true
love
cannot
exist.
Moore,
with
all
his
faults,
might
be
esteemed;
for
he
had
no
moral
scrofula
in
his
mind,
no
hopeless
polluting
taint
such,
for
instance,
as
that
of
falsehood;
neither
was
he
the
slave
of
his
appetites.
The
active
life
to
which
he
had
been
born
and
bred
had
given
him
something
else
to
do
than
to
join
the
futile
chase
of
the
pleasure
hunter.
He
was
a
man
undegraded,
the
disciple
of
reason,
not
the
votary
of
sense.
The
same
might
be
said
of
old
Helstone.
Neither
of
these
two
would
look,
think,
or
speak
a
lie;
for
neither
of
them
had
the
wretched
black
bottle,
which
had
just
been
put
away,
any
charms.
Both
might
boast
a
valid
claim
to
the
proud
title
of
"lord
of
the
creation,"
for
no
animal
vice
was
lord
of
them;
they
looked
and
were
superior
beings
to
poor
Sykes.
A
sort
of
gathering
and
trampling
sound
was
heard
in
the
yard,
and
then
a
pause.
Moore
walked
to
the
window;
Helstone
followed.
Both
stood
on
one
side,
the
tall
junior
behind
the
under
sized
senior,
looking
forth
carefully,
so
that
they
might
not
be
visible
from
without.
Their
sole
comment
on
what
they
saw
was
a
cynical
smile
flashed
into
each
other's
stern
eyes.
A
flourishing
oratorical
cough
was
now
heard,
followed
by
the
interjection
"Whisht!"
designed,
as
it
seemed,
to
still
the
hum
of
several
voices.
Moore
opened
his
casement
an
inch
or
two
to
admit
sound
more
freely.
"Joseph
Scott,"
began
a
snuffling
voice
Scott
was
standing
sentinel
at
the
counting
house
door
"might
we
inquire
if
your
master
be
within,
and
is
to
be
spoken
to?"
"He's
within,
ay,"
said
Joe
nonchalantly.
"Would
you
then,
if
you
please"
(emphasis
on
"you"),
"have
the
goodness
to
tell
him
that
twelve
gentlemen
wants
to
see
him."
"He'd
happen
ax
what
for,"
suggested
Joe.
"I
mught
as
weel
tell
him
that
at
t'
same
time."
"For
a
purpose,"
was
the
answer.
Joe
entered.
"Please,
sir,
there's
twelve
gentlemen
wants
to
see
ye,
'for
a
purpose.'"
"Good,
Joe;
I'm
their
man.
Sugden,
come
when
I
whistle."
Moore
went
out,
chuckling
dryly.
He
advanced
into
the
yard,
one
hand
in
his
pocket,
the
other
in
his
waistcoat,
his
cap
brim
over
his
eyes,
shading
in
some
measure
their
deep
dancing
ray
of
scorn.
Twelve
men
waited
