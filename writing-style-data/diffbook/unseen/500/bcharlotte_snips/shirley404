I
cannot
bear
that
you
should
think
better
of
me
than
I
deserve."
"Well,
but
I
half
know
your
'thing;'
indeed,
I
believe
I
know
all
about
it."
"You
do
not."
"I
believe
I
do."
"Whom
does
it
concern
besides
me?"
She
coloured;
she
hesitated;
she
was
silent.
"Speak,
Cary!
Whom
does
it
concern?"
She
tried
to
utter
a
name,
and
could
not.
"Tell
me;
there
is
none
present
but
ourselves.
Be
frank."
"But
if
I
guess
wrong?"
"I
will
forgive.
Whisper,
Cary."
He
bent
his
ear
to
her
lips.
Still
she
would
not,
or
could
not,
speak
clearly
to
the
point.
Seeing
that
Moore
waited
and
was
resolved
to
hear
something,
she
at
last
said,
"Miss
Keeldar
spent
a
day
at
the
rectory
about
a
week
since.
The
evening
came
on
very
wintry,
and
we
persuaded
her
to
stay
all
night."
"And
you
and
she
curled
your
hair
together?"
"How
do
you
know
that?"
"And
then
you
chattered,
and
she
told
you
"
"It
was
not
at
curling
hair
time,
so
you
are
not
as
wise
as
you
think;
and,
besides,
she
didn't
tell
me."
"You
slept
together
afterwards?"
"We
occupied
the
same
room
and
bed.
We
did
not
sleep
much;
we
talked
the
whole
night
through."
"I'll
be
sworn
you
did!
And
then
it
all
came
out
tant
pis.
I
would
rather
you
had
heard
it
from
myself."
"You
are
quite
wrong.
She
did
not
tell
me
what
you
suspect
she
is
not
the
person
to
proclaim
such
things;
but
yet
I
inferred
something
from
parts
of
her
discourse.
I
gathered
more
from
rumour,
and
I
made
out
the
rest
by
instinct."
"But
if
she
did
not
tell
you
that
I
wanted
to
marry
her
for
the
sake
of
her
money,
and
that
she
refused
me
indignantly
and
scornfully
(you
need
neither
start
nor
blush;
nor
yet
need
you
prick
your
trembling
fingers
with
your
needle.
That
is
the
plain
truth,
whether
you
like
it
or
not)
if
such
was
not
the
subject
of
her
august
confidences,
on
what
point
did
they
turn?
You
say
you
talked
the
whole
night
through;
what
about?"
"About
things
we
never
thoroughly
discussed
before,
intimate
friends
as
we
have
been;
but
you
hardly
expect
I
should
tell
you?"
"Yes,
yes,
Cary;
you
will
tell
me.
You
said
we
were
friends,
and
friends
should
always
confide
in
each
other."
"But
you
are
sure
you
won't
repeat
it?"
"Quite
sure."
"Not
to
Louis?"
"Not
even
to
Louis.
What
does
Louis
care
for
young
ladies'
secrets?"
"Robert,
Shirley
is
a
curious,
magnanimous
being."
"I
dare
say.
I
can
imagine
there
are
both
odd
points
and
grand
points
about
her."
"I
have
found
her
chary
in
showing
her
feelings;
but
when
they
rush
out,
river
like,
and
pass
full
and
powerful
before
you
almost
without
leave
from
her
you
gaze,
wonder;
you
admire,
and
I
think
love
her."
"You
saw
this
spectacle?"
"Yes;
at
dead
of
night,
when
all
the
house
was
silent,
and
starlight
and
