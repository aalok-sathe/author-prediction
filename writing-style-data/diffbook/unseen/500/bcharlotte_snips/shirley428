azure
and
red
gold.
It
fits
the
time;
it
fits
the
age;
it
fits
the
present
spirit
of
the
nations.
The
nineteenth
century
wantons
in
its
giant
adolescence;
the
Titan
boy
uproots
mountains
in
his
game,
and
hurls
rocks
in
his
wild
sport.
This
summer
Bonaparte
is
in
the
saddle;
he
and
his
host
scour
Russian
deserts.
He
has
with
him
Frenchmen
and
Poles,
Italians
and
children
of
the
Rhine,
six
hundred
thousand
strong.
He
marches
on
old
Moscow.
Under
old
Moscow's
walls
the
rude
Cossack
waits
him.
Barbarian
stoic!
he
waits
without
fear
of
the
boundless
ruin
rolling
on.
He
puts
his
trust
in
a
snow
cloud;
the
wilderness,
the
wind,
and
the
hail
storm
are
his
refuge;
his
allies
are
the
elements
air,
fire,
water.
And
what
are
these?
Three
terrible
archangels
ever
stationed
before
the
throne
of
Jehovah.
They
stand
clothed
in
white,
girdled
with
golden
girdles;
they
uplift
vials,
brimming
with
the
wrath
of
God.
Their
time
is
the
day
of
vengeance;
their
signal,
the
word
of
the
Lord
of
hosts,
"thundering
with
the
voice
of
His
excellency."
"Hast
thou
entered
into
the
treasures
of
the
snow?
or
hast
thou
seen
the
treasures
of
the
hail,
which
I
have
reserved
against
the
time
of
trouble,
against
the
day
of
battle
and
war?
"Go
your
ways.
Pour
out
the
vials
of
the
wrath
of
God
upon
the
earth."
It
is
done.
The
earth
is
scorched
with
fire;
the
sea
becomes
"as
the
blood
of
a
dead
man;"
the
islands
flee
away;
the
mountains
are
not
found.
In
this
year,
Lord
Wellington
assumed
the
reins
in
Spain.
They
made
him
generalissimo,
for
their
own
salvation's
sake.
In
this
year
he
took
Badajos,
he
fought
the
field
of
Vittoria,
he
captured
Pampeluna,
he
stormed
San
Sebastian;
in
this
year
he
won
Salamanca.
Men
of
Manchester,
I
beg
your
pardon
for
this
slight
resume
of
warlike
facts,
but
it
is
of
no
consequence.
Lord
Wellington
is,
for
you,
only
a
decayed
old
gentleman
now.
I
rather
think
some
of
you
have
called
him
a
"dotard;"
you
have
taunted
him
with
his
age
and
the
loss
of
his
physical
vigour.
What
fine
heroes
you
are
yourselves!
Men
like
you
have
a
right
to
trample
on
what
is
mortal
in
a
demigod.
Scoff
at
your
ease;
your
scorn
can
never
break
his
grand
old
heart.
But
come,
friends,
whether
Quakers
or
cotton
printers,
let
us
hold
a
peace
congress,
and
let
out
our
venom
quietly.
We
have
been
talking
with
unseemly
zeal
about
bloody
battles
and
butchering
generals;
we
arrive
now
at
a
triumph
in
your
line.
On
the
18th
of
June
1812
the
Orders
in
Council
were
repealed,
and
the
blockaded
ports
thrown
open.
You
know
very
well
such
of
you
as
are
old
enough
to
remember
you
made
Yorkshire
and
Lancashire
shake
with
your
shout
on
that
occasion.
The
ringers
cracked
a
bell
in
Briarfield
belfry;
it
is
dissonant
to
this
day.
The
Association
of
Merchants
and
Manufacturers
dined
together
