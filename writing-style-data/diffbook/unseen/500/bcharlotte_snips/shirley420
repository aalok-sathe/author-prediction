lie
down
till
I
am
fed
with
one
sweet
word.'
"And
at
last
she
gave
it.
"'Dear
Louis,
be
faithful
to
me;
never
leave
me.
I
don't
care
for
life
unless
I
may
pass
it
at
your
side.'
"'Something
more.'
"She
gave
me
a
change;
it
was
not
her
way
to
offer
the
same
dish
twice.
"'Sir,'
she
said,
starting
up,
'at
your
peril
you
ever
again
name
such
sordid
things
as
money,
or
poverty,
or
inequality.
It
will
be
absolutely
dangerous
to
torment
me
with
these
maddening
scruples.
I
defy
you
to
do
it.'
"My
face
grew
hot.
I
did
once
more
wish
I
were
not
so
poor
or
she
were
not
so
rich.
She
saw
the
transient
misery;
and
then,
indeed,
she
caressed
me.
Blent
with
torment,
I
experienced
rapture.
"'Mr.
Moore,'
said
she,
looking
up
with
a
sweet,
open,
earnest
countenance,
'teach
me
and
help
me
to
be
good.
I
do
not
ask
you
to
take
off
my
shoulders
all
the
cares
and
duties
of
property,
but
I
ask
you
to
share
the
burden,
and
to
show
me
how
to
sustain
my
part
well.
Your
judgment
is
well
balanced,
your
heart
is
kind,
your
principles
are
sound.
I
know
you
are
wise;
I
feel
you
are
benevolent;
I
believe
you
are
conscientious.
Be
my
companion
through
life;
be
my
guide
where
I
am
ignorant;
be
my
master
where
I
am
faulty;
be
my
friend
always!'
"'So
help
me
God,
I
will!'"
Yet
again
a
passage
from
the
blank
book
if
you
like,
reader;
if
you
don't
like
it,
pass
it
over:
"The
Sympsons
are
gone,
but
not
before
discovery
and
explanation.
My
manner
must
have
betrayed
something,
or
my
looks.
I
was
quiet,
but
I
forgot
to
be
guarded
sometimes.
I
stayed
longer
in
the
room
than
usual;
I
could
not
bear
to
be
out
of
her
presence;
I
returned
to
it,
and
basked
in
it,
like
Tartar
in
the
sun.
If
she
left
the
oak
parlour,
instinctively
I
rose
and
left
it
too.
She
chid
me
for
this
procedure
more
than
once.
I
did
it
with
a
vague,
blundering
idea
of
getting
a
word
with
her
in
the
hall
or
elsewhere.
Yesterday
towards
dusk
I
had
her
to
myself
for
five
minutes
by
the
hall
fire.
We
stood
side
by
side;
she
was
railing
at
me,
and
I
was
enjoying
the
sound
of
her
voice.
The
young
ladies
passed,
and
looked
at
us;
we
did
not
separate.
Ere
long
they
repassed,
and
again
looked.
Mrs.
Sympson
came;
we
did
not
move.
Mr.
Sympson
opened
the
dining
room
door.
Shirley
flashed
him
back
full
payment
for
his
spying
gaze.
She
curled
her
lip
and
tossed
her
tresses.
The
glance
she
gave
was
at
once
explanatory
and
defiant.
It
said:
'I
like
Mr.
Moore's
society,
and
I
dare
you
to
find
fault
with
my
taste.'
"I
asked,
'Do
you
mean
him
to
understand
how
matters
are?'
"'I
do,'
said
she;
'but
I
leave
the
development
to
chance.
