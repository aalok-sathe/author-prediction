and
leave
it
for
him."
Now,
having
caught
these
words,
and
hearing
him
advance,
Caroline,
if
there
was
a
door
within
the
dining
room,
would
glide
through
it
and
disappear.
She
feels
caught,
hemmed
in;
she
dreads
her
unexpected
presence
may
annoy
him.
A
second
since
she
would
have
flown
to
him;
that
second
past,
she
would
flee
from
him.
She
cannot.
There
is
no
way
of
escape.
The
dining
room
has
but
one
door,
through
which
now
enters
her
cousin.
The
look
of
troubled
surprise
she
expected
to
see
in
his
face
has
appeared
there,
has
shocked
her,
and
is
gone.
She
has
stammered
a
sort
of
apology:
"I
only
left
the
drawing
room
a
minute
for
a
little
quiet."
There
was
something
so
diffident
and
downcast
in
the
air
and
tone
with
which
she
said
this,
any
one
might
perceive
that
some
saddening
change
had
lately
passed
over
her
prospects,
and
that
the
faculty
of
cheerful
self
possession
had
left
her.
Mr.
Moore,
probably,
remembered
how
she
had
formerly
been
accustomed
to
meet
him
with
gentle
ardour
and
hopeful
confidence.
He
must
have
seen
how
the
check
of
this
morning
had
operated.
Here
was
an
opportunity
for
carrying
out
his
new
system
with
effect,
if
he
chose
to
improve
it.
Perhaps
he
found
it
easier
to
practise
that
system
in
broad
daylight,
in
his
mill
yard,
amidst
busy
occupations,
than
in
a
quiet
parlour,
disengaged,
at
the
hour
of
eventide.
Fanny
lit
the
candles,
which
before
had
stood
unlit
on
the
table,
brought
writing
materials,
and
left
the
room.
Caroline
was
about
to
follow
her.
Moore,
to
act
consistently,
should
have
let
her
go;
whereas
he
stood
in
the
doorway,
and,
holding
out
his
hand,
gently
kept
her
back.
He
did
not
ask
her
to
stay,
but
he
would
not
let
her
go.
"Shall
I
tell
my
uncle
you
are
here?"
asked
she,
still
in
the
same
subdued
voice.
"No;
I
can
say
to
you
all
I
had
to
say
to
him.
You
will
be
my
messenger?"
"Yes,
Robert."
"Then
you
may
just
inform
him
that
I
have
got
a
clue
to
the
identity
of
one,
at
least,
of
the
men
who
broke
my
frames;
that
he
belongs
to
the
same
gang
who
attacked
Sykes
and
Pearson's
dressing
shop,
and
that
I
hope
to
have
him
in
custody
to
morrow.
You
can
remember
that?"
"Oh
yes!"
These
two
monosyllables
were
uttered
in
a
sadder
tone
than
ever;
and
as
she
said
them
she
shook
her
head
slightly
and
sighed.
"Will
you
prosecute
him?"
"Doubtless."
"No,
Robert."
"And
why
no,
Caroline?"
"Because
it
will
set
all
the
neighbourhood
against
you
more
than
ever."
"That
is
no
reason
why
I
should
not
do
my
duty,
and
defend
my
property.
This
fellow
is
a
great
scoundrel,
and
ought
to
be
incapacitated
from
perpetrating
further
mischief."
"But
his
accomplices
will
take
revenge
on
you.
You
do
not
know
how
the
people
of
this
country
bear
malice.
It
is
the
boast
of
some
