was
her
whim
to
wish
it;
but
what
means
to
employ
for
her
entertainment
he
knew
not.
He
hemmed
he
fidgeted.
"You'll
be
up
in
a
trice,"
he
observed,
by
way
of
saying
something.
"The
little
weakness
will
soon
pass
off;
and
then
you
must
drink
port
wine
a
pipe,
if
you
can
and
eat
game
and
oysters.
I'll
get
them
for
you,
if
they
are
to
be
had
anywhere.
Bless
me!
we'll
make
you
as
strong
as
Samson
before
we're
done
with
you."
"Who
is
that
lady,
uncle,
standing
beside
you
at
the
bed
foot?"
"Good
God!"
he
ejaculated.
"She's
not
wandering,
is
she,
ma'am?"
Mrs.
Pryor
smiled.
"I
am
wandering
in
a
pleasant
world,"
said
Caroline,
in
a
soft,
happy
voice,
"and
I
want
you
to
tell
me
whether
it
is
real
or
visionary.
What
lady
is
that?
Give
her
a
name,
uncle."
"We
must
have
Dr.
Rile
again,
ma'am;
or
better
still,
MacTurk.
He's
less
of
a
humbug.
Thomas
must
saddle
the
pony
and
go
for
him."
"No;
I
don't
want
a
doctor.
Mamma
shall
be
my
only
physician.
Now,
do
you
understand,
uncle?"
Mr.
Helstone
pushed
up
his
spectacles
from
his
nose
to
his
forehead,
handled
his
snuff
box,
and
administered
to
himself
a
portion
of
the
contents.
Thus
fortified,
he
answered
briefly,
"I
see
daylight.
You've
told
her
then,
ma'am?"
"And
is
it
true?"
demanded
Caroline,
rising
on
her
pillow.
"Is
she
really
my
mother?"
"You
won't
cry,
or
make
any
scene,
or
turn
hysterical,
if
I
answer
Yes?"
"Cry!
I'd
cry
if
you
said
No.
It
would
be
terrible
to
be
disappointed
now.
But
give
her
a
name.
How
do
you
call
her?"
"I
call
this
stout
lady
in
a
quaint
black
dress,
who
looks
young
enough
to
wear
much
smarter
raiment,
if
she
would
I
call
her
Agnes
Helstone.
She
married
my
brother
James,
and
is
his
widow."
"And
my
mother?"
"What
a
little
sceptic
it
is!
Look
at
her
small
face,
Mrs.
Pryor,
scarcely
larger
than
the
palm
of
my
hand,
alive
with
acuteness
and
eagerness."
To
Caroline
"She
had
the
trouble
of
bringing
you
into
the
world
at
any
rate.
Mind
you
show
your
duty
to
her
by
quickly
getting
well,
and
repairing
the
waste
of
these
cheeks.
Heigh
ho!
she
used
to
be
plump.
What
she
has
done
with
it
all
I
can't,
for
the
life
of
me,
divine."
"If
wishing
to
get
well
will
help
me,
I
shall
not
be
long
sick.
This
morning
I
had
no
reason
and
no
strength
to
wish
it."
Fanny
here
tapped
at
the
door,
and
said
that
supper
was
ready.
"Uncle,
if
you
please,
you
may
send
me
a
little
bit
of
supper
anything
you
like,
from
your
own
plate.
That
is
wiser
than
going
into
hysterics,
is
it
not?"
"It
is
spoken
like
a
sage,
Cary.
See
if
I
don't
cater
for
you
judiciously.
When
women
are
sensible,
and,
above
all,
intelligible,
I
can
get
on
with
them.
It
is
only
the
