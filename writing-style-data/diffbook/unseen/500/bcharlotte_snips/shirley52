book
to
Robert
in
the
counting
house,
and
get
the
rough
place
made
smooth
by
his
aid.
Mr.
Moore
possessed
a
clear,
tranquil
brain
of
his
own.
Almost
as
soon
as
he
looked
at
Caroline's
little
difficulties
they
seemed
to
dissolve
beneath
his
eye.
In
two
minutes
he
would
explain
all,
in
two
words
give
the
key
to
the
puzzle.
She
thought
if
Hortense
could
only
teach
like
him,
how
much
faster
she
might
learn!
Repaying
him
by
an
admiring
and
grateful
smile,
rather
shed
at
his
feet
than
lifted
to
his
face,
she
would
leave
the
mill
reluctantly
to
go
back
to
the
cottage,
and
then,
while
she
completed
the
exercise,
or
worked
out
the
sum
(for
Mdlle.
Moore
taught
her
arithmetic
too),
she
would
wish
nature
had
made
her
a
boy
instead
of
a
girl,
that
she
might
ask
Robert
to
let
her
be
his
clerk,
and
sit
with
him
in
the
counting
house,
instead
of
sitting
with
Hortense
in
the
parlour.
Occasionally
but
this
happened
very
rarely
she
spent
the
evening
at
Hollow's
Cottage.
Sometimes
during
these
visits
Moore
was
away
attending
a
market;
sometimes
he
was
gone
to
Mr.
Yorke's;
often
he
was
engaged
with
a
male
visitor
in
another
room;
but
sometimes,
too,
he
was
at
home,
disengaged,
free
to
talk
with
Caroline.
When
this
was
the
case,
the
evening
hours
passed
on
wings
of
light;
they
were
gone
before
they
were
counted.
There
was
no
room
in
England
so
pleasant
as
that
small
parlour
when
the
three
cousins
occupied
it.
Hortense,
when
she
was
not
teaching,
or
scolding,
or
cooking,
was
far
from
ill
humoured;
it
was
her
custom
to
relax
towards
evening,
and
to
be
kind
to
her
young
English
kinswoman.
There
was
a
means,
too,
of
rendering
her
delightful,
by
inducing
her
to
take
her
guitar
and
sing
and
play.
She
then
became
quite
good
natured.
And
as
she
played
with
skill,
and
had
a
well
toned
voice,
it
was
not
disagreeable
to
listen
to
her.
It
would
have
been
absolutely
agreeable,
except
that
her
formal
and
self
important
character
modulated
her
strains,
as
it
impressed
her
manners
and
moulded
her
countenance.
Mr.
Moore,
released
from
the
business
yoke,
was,
if
not
lively
himself,
a
willing
spectator
of
Caroline's
liveliness,
a
complacent
listener
to
her
talk,
a
ready
respondent
to
her
questions.
He
was
something
agreeable
to
sit
near,
to
hover
round,
to
address
and
look
at.
Sometimes
he
was
better
than
this
almost
animated,
quite
gentle
and
friendly.
The
drawback
was
that
by
the
next
morning
he
was
sure
to
be
frozen
up
again;
and
however
much
he
seemed,
in
his
quiet
way,
to
enjoy
these
social
evenings,
he
rarely
contrived
their
recurrence.
This
circumstance
puzzled
the
inexperienced
head
of
his
cousin.
"If
I
had
a
means
of
happiness
at
my
command,"
she
thought,
"I
would
employ
that
means
often.
I
would
keep
it
bright
with
use,
and
not
let
it
lie
for
weeks
aside,
till
it
gets
rusty."
Yet
she
