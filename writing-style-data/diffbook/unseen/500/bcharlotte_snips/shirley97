begin
selling
stuff."
"Could
you,
William?"
"Please
God,"
returned
William
deliberately,
"I
could
buy
groceries,
and
bits
o'
tapes,
and
thread,
and
what
I
thought
would
sell,
and
I
could
begin
hawking
at
first."
"And
you
know,
sir,"
interposed
Grace,
"you're
sure
William
would
neither
drink,
nor
idle,
nor
waste,
in
any
way.
He's
my
husband,
and
I
shouldn't
praise
him;
but
I
will
say
there's
not
a
soberer,
honester
man
i'
England
nor
he
is."
"Well,
I'll
speak
to
one
or
two
friends,
and
I
think
I
can
promise
to
let
him
have
5
in
a
day
or
two
as
a
loan,
ye
mind,
not
a
gift.
He
must
pay
it
back."
"I
understand,
sir.
I'm
quite
agreeable
to
that."
"Meantime,
there's
a
few
shillings
for
you,
Grace,
just
to
keep
the
pot
boiling
till
custom
comes.
Now,
bairns,
stand
up
in
a
row
and
say
your
catechism,
while
your
mother
goes
and
buys
some
dinner;
for
you've
not
had
much
to
day,
I'll
be
bound.
You
begin,
Ben.
What
is
your
name?"
Mr.
Hall
stayed
till
Grace
came
back;
then
he
hastily
took
his
leave,
shaking
hands
with
both
Farren
and
his
wife.
Just
at
the
door
he
said
to
them
a
few
brief
but
very
earnest
words
of
religious
consolation
and
exhortation.
With
a
mutual
"God
bless
you,
sir!"
"God
bless
you,
my
friends!"
they
separated.
Messrs.
Helstone
and
Sykes
began
to
be
extremely
jocose
and
congratulatory
with
Mr.
Moore
when
he
returned
to
them
after
dismissing
the
deputation.
He
was
so
quiet,
however,
under
their
compliments
upon
his
firmness,
etc.,
and
wore
a
countenance
so
like
a
still,
dark
day,
equally
beamless
and
breezeless,
that
the
rector,
after
glancing
shrewdly
into
his
eyes,
buttoned
up
his
felicitations
with
his
coat,
and
said
to
Sykes,
whose
senses
were
not
acute
enough
to
enable
him
to
discover
unassisted
where
his
presence
and
conversation
were
a
nuisance,
"Come,
sir;
your
road
and
mine
lie
partly
together.
Had
we
not
better
bear
each
other
company?
We'll
bid
Moore
good
morning,
and
leave
him
to
the
happy
fancies
he
seems
disposed
to
indulge."
"And
where
is
Sugden?"
demanded
Moore,
looking
up.
"Ah,
ha!"
cried
Helstone.
"I've
not
been
quite
idle
while
you
were
busy.
I've
been
helping
you
a
little;
I
flatter
myself
not
injudiciously.
I
thought
it
better
not
to
lose
time;
so,
while
you
were
parleying
with
that
down
looking
gentleman
Farren
I
think
his
name
is
I
opened
this
back
window,
shouted
to
Murgatroyd,
who
was
in
the
stable,
to
bring
Mr.
Sykes's
gig
round;
then
I
smuggled
Sugden
and
brother
Moses
wooden
leg
and
all
through
the
aperture,
and
saw
them
mount
the
gig
(always
with
our
good
friend
Sykes's
permission,
of
course).
Sugden
took
the
reins
he
drives
like
Jehu
and
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
Barraclough
will
be
safe
in
Stilbro'
jail."
"Very
good;
thank
you,"
said
Moore;
"and
good
morning,
gentlemen,"
he
added,
and
so
politely
conducted
them
to
the
door,
and
saw
