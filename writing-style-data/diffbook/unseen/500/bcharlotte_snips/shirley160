cake,
and
an
ample
measure
of
remonstrances,
expostulations,
and
persuasions.
It
grows
rather
chill."
"I
perceive
you
shiver.
Am
I
acting
wrongly
to
detain
you
here?
Yet
it
is
so
calm
I
even
feel
it
warm
and
society
such
as
yours
is
a
pleasure
to
me
so
rare.
If
you
were
wrapped
in
a
thicker
shawl
"
"I
might
stay
longer,
and
forget
how
late
it
is,
which
would
chagrin
Mrs.
Pryor.
We
keep
early
and
regular
hours
at
Fieldhead,
Mr.
Moore;
and
so,
I
am
sure,
does
your
sister
at
the
cottage."
"Yes;
but
Hortense
and
I
have
an
understanding
the
most
convenient
in
the
world,
that
we
shall
each
do
as
we
please."
"How
do
you
please
to
do?"
"Three
nights
in
the
week
I
sleep
in
the
mill
but
I
require
little
rest
and
when
it
is
moonlight
and
mild
I
often
haunt
the
Hollow
till
daybreak."
"When
I
was
a
very
little
girl,
Mr.
Moore,
my
nurse
used
to
tell
me
tales
of
fairies
being
seen
in
that
Hollow.
That
was
before
my
father
built
the
mill,
when
it
was
a
perfectly
solitary
ravine.
You
will
be
falling
under
enchantment."
"I
fear
it
is
done,"
said
Moore,
in
a
low
voice.
"But
there
are
worse
things
than
fairies
to
be
guarded
against,"
pursued
Miss
Keeldar.
"Things
more
perilous,"
he
subjoined.
"Far
more
so.
For
instance,
how
would
you
like
to
meet
Michael
Hartley,
that
mad
Calvinist
and
Jacobin
weaver?
They
say
he
is
addicted
to
poaching,
and
often
goes
abroad
at
night
with
his
gun."
"I
have
already
had
the
luck
to
meet
him.
We
held
a
long
argument
together
one
night.
A
strange
little
incident
it
was;
I
liked
it."
"Liked
it?
I
admire
your
taste!
Michael
is
not
sane.
Where
did
you
meet
him?"
"In
the
deepest,
shadiest
spot
in
the
glen,
where
the
water
runs
low,
under
brushwood.
We
sat
down
near
that
plank
bridge.
It
was
moonlight,
but
clouded,
and
very
windy.
We
had
a
talk."
"On
politics?"
"And
religion.
I
think
the
moon
was
at
the
full,
and
Michael
was
as
near
crazed
as
possible.
He
uttered
strange
blasphemy
in
his
Antinomian
fashion."
"Excuse
me,
but
I
think
you
must
have
been
nearly
as
mad
as
he,
to
sit
listening
to
him."
"There
is
a
wild
interest
in
his
ravings.
The
man
would
be
half
a
poet,
if
he
were
not
wholly
a
maniac;
and
perhaps
a
prophet,
if
he
were
not
a
profligate.
He
solemnly
informed
me
that
hell
was
foreordained
my
inevitable
portion;
that
he
read
the
mark
of
the
beast
on
my
brow;
that
I
had
been
an
outcast
from
the
beginning.
God's
vengeance,
he
said,
was
preparing
for
me,
and
affirmed
that
in
a
vision
of
the
night
he
had
beheld
the
manner
and
the
instrument
of
my
doom.
I
wanted
to
know
further,
but
he
left
me
with
these
words,
'The
end
is
not
yet.'"
"Have
you
ever
seen
him
since?"
"About
a
month
afterwards,
in
