of
her?"
"That
black
coated
tyrant's
niece
that
quiet,
delicate
Miss
Helstone.
Many
a
time
I
have
put
on
my
spectacles
to
look
at
the
lassie
in
church,
because
she
has
gentle
blue
een,
wi'
long
lashes;
and
when
she
sits
in
shadow,
and
is
very
still
and
very
pale,
and
is,
happen,
about
to
fall
asleep
wi'
the
length
of
the
sermon
and
the
heat
of
the
biggin',
she
is
as
like
one
of
Canova's
marbles
as
aught
else."
"Was
Mary
Cave
in
that
style?"
"Far
grander!
less
lass
like
and
flesh
like.
You
wondered
why
she
hadn't
wings
and
a
crown.
She
was
a
stately,
peaceful
angel
was
my
Mary."
"And
you
could
not
persuade
her
to
love
you?"
"Not
with
all
I
could
do,
though
I
prayed
Heaven
many
a
time,
on
my
bended
knees,
to
help
me."
"Mary
Cave
was
not
what
you
think
her,
Yorke.
I
have
seen
her
picture
at
the
rectory.
She
is
no
angel,
but
a
fair,
regular
featured,
taciturn
looking
woman
rather
too
white
and
lifeless
for
my
taste.
But,
supposing
she
had
been
something
better
than
she
was
"
"Robert,"
interrupted
Yorke,
"I
could
fell
you
off
your
horse
at
this
moment.
However,
I'll
hold
my
hand.
Reason
tells
me
you
are
right
and
I
am
wrong.
I
know
well
enough
that
the
passion
I
still
have
is
only
the
remnant
of
an
illusion.
If
Miss
Cave
had
possessed
either
feeling
or
sense,
she
could
not
have
been
so
perfectly
impassible
to
my
regard
as
she
showed
herself;
she
must
have
preferred
me
to
that
copper
faced
despot."
"Supposing,
Yorke,
she
had
been
educated
(no
women
were
educated
in
those
days);
supposing
she
had
possessed
a
thoughtful,
original
mind,
a
love
of
knowledge,
a
wish
for
information,
which
she
took
an
artless
delight
in
receiving
from
your
lips,
and
having
measured
out
to
her
by
your
hand;
supposing
her
conversation,
when
she
sat
at
your
side,
was
fertile,
varied,
imbued
with
a
picturesque
grace
and
genial
interest,
quiet
flowing
but
clear
and
bounteous;
supposing
that
when
you
stood
near
her
by
chance,
or
when
you
sat
near
her
by
design,
comfort
at
once
became
your
atmosphere,
and
content
your
element;
supposing
that
whenever
her
face
was
under
your
gaze,
or
her
idea
filled
your
thoughts,
you
gradually
ceased
to
be
hard
and
anxious,
and
pure
affection,
love
of
home,
thirst
for
sweet
discourse,
unselfish
longing
to
protect
and
cherish,
replaced
the
sordid,
cankering
calculations
of
your
trade;
supposing,
with
all
this,
that
many
a
time,
when
you
had
been
so
happy
as
to
possess
your
Mary's
little
hand,
you
had
felt
it
tremble
as
you
held
it,
just
as
a
warm
little
bird
trembles
when
you
take
it
from
its
nest;
supposing
you
had
noticed
her
shrink
into
the
background
on
your
entrance
into
a
room,
yet
if
you
sought
her
in
her
retreat
she
welcomed
you
with
the
sweetest
smile
that
ever
lit
a
fair
virgin
face,
and
only
