its
depths
troubled
by
the
reflection.
When
Miss
Ainley
arrived,
she
was
made
kindly
welcome
by
every
one.
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Margaret
Hall
made
room
for
her
on
the
sofa
between
them;
and
when
the
three
were
seated,
they
formed
a
trio
which
the
gay
and
thoughtless
would
have
scorned,
indeed,
as
quite
worthless
and
unattractive
a
middle
aged
widow
and
two
plain,
spectacled
old
maids
yet
which
had
its
own
quiet
value,
as
many
a
suffering
and
friendless
human
being
knew.
Shirley
opened
the
business
and
showed
the
plan.
"I
know
the
hand
which
drew
up
that,"
said
Mr.
Hall,
glancing
at
Miss
Ainley,
and
smiling
benignantly.
His
approbation
was
won
at
once.
Boultby
heard
and
deliberated
with
bent
brow
and
protruded
under
lip.
His
consent
he
considered
too
weighty
to
be
given
in
a
hurry.
Helstone
glanced
sharply
round
with
an
alert,
suspicious
expression,
as
if
he
apprehended
that
female
craft
was
at
work,
and
that
something
in
petticoats
was
somehow
trying
underhand
to
acquire
too
much
influence,
and
make
itself
of
too
much
importance.
Shirley
caught
and
comprehended
the
expression.
"This
scheme
is
nothing,"
said
she
carelessly.
"It
is
only
an
outline
a
mere
suggestion.
You,
gentlemen,
are
requested
to
draw
up
rules
of
your
own."
And
she
directly
fetched
her
writing
case,
smiling
queerly
to
herself
as
she
bent
over
the
table
where
it
stood.
She
produced
a
sheet
of
paper,
a
new
pen,
drew
an
arm
chair
to
the
table,
and
presenting
her
hand
to
old
Helstone,
begged
permission
to
install
him
in
it.
For
a
minute
he
was
a
little
stiff,
and
stood
wrinkling
his
copper
coloured
forehead
strangely.
At
last
he
muttered,
"Well,
you
are
neither
my
wife
nor
my
daughter,
so
I'll
be
led
for
once;
but
mind
I
know
I
am
led.
Your
little
female
maneauvres
don't
blind
me."
"Oh!"
said
Shirley,
dipping
the
pen
in
the
ink,
and
putting
it
into
his
hand,
"you
must
regard
me
as
Captain
Keeldar
to
day.
This
is
quite
a
gentleman's
affair
yours
and
mine
entirely,
doctor"
(so
she
had
dubbed
the
rector).
"The
ladies
there
are
only
to
be
our
aides
de
camp,
and
at
their
peril
they
speak,
till
we
have
settled
the
whole
business."
He
smiled
a
little
grimly,
and
began
to
write.
He
soon
interrupted
himself
to
ask
questions,
and
consult
his
brethren,
disdainfully
lifting
his
glance
over
the
curly
heads
of
the
two
girls
and
the
demure
caps
of
the
elder
ladies,
to
meet
the
winking
glasses
and
gray
pates
of
the
priests.
In
the
discussion
which
ensued,
all
three
gentlemen,
to
their
infinite
credit,
showed
a
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
poor
of
their
parishes
an
even
minute
knowledge
of
their
separate
wants.
Each
rector
knew
where
clothing
was
needed,
where
food
would
be
most
acceptable,
where
money
could
be
bestowed
with
a
probability
of
it
being
judiciously
laid
out.
Wherever
their
memories
fell
short,
Miss
Ainley
or
Miss
Hall,
if
applied
to,
could
help
them
out;
but
both
