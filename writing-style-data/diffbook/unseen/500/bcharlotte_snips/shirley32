his
existence
a
Polar
winter
never
gladdened
by
a
sun.
The
true
poet
is
not
one
whit
to
be
pitied,
and
he
is
apt
to
laugh
in
his
sleeve
when
any
misguided
sympathizer
whines
over
his
wrongs.
Even
when
utilitarians
sit
in
judgment
on
him,
and
pronounce
him
and
his
art
useless,
he
hears
the
sentence
with
such
a
hard
derision,
such
a
broad,
deep,
comprehensive,
and
merciless
contempt
of
the
unhappy
Pharisees
who
pronounce
it,
that
he
is
rather
to
be
chidden
than
condoled
with.
These,
however,
are
not
Mr.
Yorke's
reflections,
and
it
is
with
Mr.
Yorke
we
have
at
present
to
do.
I
have
told
you
some
of
his
faults,
reader:
as
to
his
good
points,
he
was
one
of
the
most
honourable
and
capable
men
in
Yorkshire;
even
those
who
disliked
him
were
forced
to
respect
him.
He
was
much
beloved
by
the
poor,
because
he
was
thoroughly
kind
and
very
fatherly
to
them.
To
his
workmen
he
was
considerate
and
cordial.
When
he
dismissed
them
from
an
occupation,
he
would
try
to
set
them
on
to
something
else,
or,
if
that
was
impossible,
help
them
to
remove
with
their
families
to
a
district
where
work
might
possibly
be
had.
It
must
also
be
remarked
that
if,
as
sometimes
chanced,
any
individual
amongst
his
"hands"
showed
signs
of
insubordination,
Yorke
who,
like
many
who
abhor
being
controlled,
knew
how
to
control
with
vigour
had
the
secret
of
crushing
rebellion
in
the
germ,
of
eradicating
it
like
a
bad
weed,
so
that
it
never
spread
or
developed
within
the
sphere
of
his
authority.
Such
being
the
happy
state
of
his
own
affairs,
he
felt
himself
at
liberty
to
speak
with
the
utmost
severity
of
those
who
were
differently
situated,
to
ascribe
whatever
was
unpleasant
in
their
position
entirely
to
their
own
fault,
to
sever
himself
from
the
masters,
and
advocate
freely
the
cause
of
the
operatives.
Mr.
Yorke's
family
was
the
first
and
oldest
in
the
district;
and
he,
though
not
the
wealthiest,
was
one
of
the
most
influential
men.
His
education
had
been
good.
In
his
youth,
before
the
French
Revolution,
he
had
travelled
on
the
Continent.
He
was
an
adept
in
the
French
and
Italian
languages.
During
a
two
years'
sojourn
in
Italy
he
had
collected
many
good
paintings
and
tasteful
rarities,
with
which
his
residence
was
now
adorned.
His
manners,
when
he
liked,
were
those
of
a
finished
gentleman
of
the
old
school;
his
conversation,
when
he
was
disposed
to
please,
was
singularly
interesting
and
original;
and
if
he
usually
expressed
himself
in
the
Yorkshire
dialect,
it
was
because
he
chose
to
do
so,
preferring
his
native
Doric
to
a
more
refined
vocabulary,
"A
Yorkshire
burr,"
he
affirmed,
"was
as
much
better
than
a
cockney's
lisp
as
a
bull's
bellow
than
a
raton's
squeak."
Mr.
Yorke
knew
every
one,
and
was
known
by
every
one,
for
miles
round;
yet
his
intimate
acquaintances
were
very
few.
Himself
thoroughly
original,
he
had
no
taste
for
what
