done
or
intended
to
do
he
believed
to
be
for
the
best.'
"'You
are
kind
to
undertake
the
defence
of
a
man
who
has
permitted
himself
to
treat
you
with
so
much
insolence.'
"'I
never
feel
shocked
at,
or
bear
malice
for,
what
is
spoken
in
character;
and
most
perfectly
in
character
was
that
vulgar
and
violent
onset
against
me,
when
he
had
quitted
you
worsted.'
"'You
cease
now
to
be
Henry's
tutor?'
"'I
shall
be
parted
from
Henry
for
a
while
(if
he
and
I
live
we
shall
meet
again
somehow,
for
we
love
each
other)
and
be
ousted
from
the
bosom
of
the
Sympson
family
for
ever.
Happily
this
change
does
not
leave
me
stranded;
it
but
hurries
into
premature
execution
designs
long
formed.'
"'No
change
finds
you
off
your
guard.
I
was
sure,
in
your
calm
way,
you
would
be
prepared
for
sudden
mutation.
I
always
think
you
stand
in
the
world
like
a
solitary
but
watchful,
thoughtful
archer
in
a
wood.
And
the
quiver
on
your
shoulder
holds
more
arrows
than
one;
your
bow
is
provided
with
a
second
string.
Such
too
is
your
brother's
wont.
You
two
might
go
forth
homeless
hunters
to
the
loneliest
western
wilds;
all
would
be
well
with
you.
The
hewn
tree
would
make
you
a
hut,
the
cleared
forest
yield
you
fields
from
its
stripped
bosom,
the
buffalo
would
feel
your
rifle
shot,
and
with
lowered
horns
and
hump
pay
homage
at
your
feet.'
"'And
any
Indian
tribe
of
Blackfeet
or
Flatheads
would
afford
us
a
bride,
perhaps?'
"'No'
(hesitating),
'I
think
not.
The
savage
is
sordid.
I
think
that
is,
I
hope
you
would
neither
of
you
share
your
hearth
with
that
to
which
you
could
not
give
your
heart.'
"'What
suggested
the
wild
West
to
your
mind,
Miss
Keeldar?
Have
you
been
with
me
in
spirit
when
I
did
not
see
you?
Have
you
entered
into
my
day
dreams,
and
beheld
my
brain
labouring
at
its
scheme
of
a
future?'
"She
had
separated
a
slip
of
paper
for
lighting
tapers
a
spill,
as
it
is
called
into
fragments.
She
threw
morsel
by
morsel
into
the
fire,
and
stood
pensively
watching
them
consume.
She
did
not
speak.
"'How
did
you
learn
what
you
seem
to
know
about
my
intentions?'
"'I
know
nothing.
I
am
only
discovering
them
now.
I
spoke
at
hazard.'
"'Your
hazard
sounds
like
divination.
A
tutor
I
will
never
be
again;
never
take
a
pupil
after
Henry
and
yourself;
not
again
will
I
sit
habitually
at
another
man's
table
no
more
be
the
appendage
of
a
family.
I
am
now
a
man
of
thirty;
I
have
never
been
free
since
I
was
a
boy
of
ten.
I
have
such
a
thirst
for
freedom,
such
a
deep
passion
to
know
her
and
call
her
mine,
such
a
day
desire
and
night
longing
to
win
her
and
possess
her,
I
will
not
refuse
to
cross
the
Atlantic
for
her
sake;
her
I
will
follow
deep
into
virgin
woods.
