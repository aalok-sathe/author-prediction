gave
the
interpretation
thereof.
It
signifies,
he
intimated,
bloodshed
and
civil
conflict."
"Do
you
credit
it,
sir?"
asked
Sweeting.
"Do
you,
Davy?
But
come,
Malone;
why
are
you
not
off?"
"I
am
rather
surprised,
sir,
you
did
not
stay
with
Moore
yourself.
You
like
this
kind
of
thing."
"So
I
should
have
done,
had
I
not
unfortunately
happened
to
engage
Boultby
to
sup
with
me
on
his
way
home
from
the
Bible
Society
meeting
at
Nunnely.
I
promised
to
send
you
as
my
substitute;
for
which,
by
the
bye,
he
did
not
thank
me.
He
would
much
rather
have
had
me
than
you,
Peter.
Should
there
be
any
real
need
of
help
I
shall
join
you.
The
mill
bell
will
give
warning.
Meantime,
go
unless
(turning
suddenly
to
Messrs.
Sweeting
and
Donne)
unless
Davy
Sweeting
or
Joseph
Donne
prefers
going.
What
do
you
say,
gentlemen?
The
commission
is
an
honourable
one,
not
without
the
seasoning
of
a
little
real
peril;
for
the
country
is
in
a
queer
state,
as
you
all
know,
and
Moore
and
his
mill
and
his
machinery
are
held
in
sufficient
odium.
There
are
chivalric
sentiments,
there
is
high
beating
courage,
under
those
waistcoats
of
yours,
I
doubt
not.
Perhaps
I
am
too
partial
to
my
favourite
Peter.
Little
David
shall
be
the
champion,
or
spotless
Joseph.
Malone,
you
are
but
a
great
floundering
Saul
after
all,
good
only
to
lend
your
armour.
Out
with
your
firearms;
fetch
your
shillelah.
It
is
there
in
the
corner."
With
a
significant
grin
Malone
produced
his
pistols,
offering
one
to
each
of
his
brethren.
They
were
not
readily
seized
on.
With
graceful
modesty
each
gentleman
retired
a
step
from
the
presented
weapon.
"I
never
touch
them.
I
never
did
touch
anything
of
the
kind,"
said
Mr.
Donne.
"I
am
almost
a
stranger
to
Mr.
Moore,"
murmured
Sweeting.
"If
you
never
touched
a
pistol,
try
the
feel
of
it
now,
great
satrap
of
Egypt.
As
to
the
little
minstrel,
he
probably
prefers
encountering
the
Philistines
with
no
other
weapon
than
his
flute.
Get
their
hats,
Peter.
They'll
both
of
'em
go."
"No,
sir;
no,
Mr.
Helstone.
My
mother
wouldn't
like
it,"
pleaded
Sweeting.
"And
I
make
it
a
rule
never
to
get
mixed
up
in
affairs
of
the
kind,"
observed
Donne.
Helstone
smiled
sardonically;
Malone
laughed
a
horse
laugh.
He
then
replaced
his
arms,
took
his
hat
and
cudgel,
and
saying
that
"he
never
felt
more
in
tune
for
a
shindy
in
his
life,
and
that
he
wished
a
score
of
greasy
cloth
dressers
might
beat
up
Moore's
quarters
that
night,"
he
made
his
exit,
clearing
the
stairs
at
a
stride
or
two,
and
making
the
house
shake
with
the
bang
of
the
front
door
behind
him.
The
evening
was
pitch
dark:
star
and
moon
were
quenched
in
gray
rain
clouds
gray
they
would
have
been
by
day;
by
night
they
looked
sable.
Malone
was
not
a
man
given
to
close
observation
of
nature;
her
changes
passed,
for
the
most
part,
