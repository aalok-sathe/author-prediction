perhaps
a
harsh
but
an
effectual
cure
for
her
sufferings.
But
this
judgment,
founded
on
circumstances
she
could
fully
explain
to
none,
least
of
all
to
Shirley,
seemed,
in
all
eyes
but
her
own,
incomprehensible
and
fantastic,
and
was
opposed
accordingly.
There
really
was
no
present
pecuniary
need
for
her
to
leave
a
comfortable
home
and
"take
a
situation;"
and
there
was
every
probability
that
her
uncle
might,
in
some
way,
permanently
provide
for
her.
So
her
friends
thought,
and,
as
far
as
their
lights
enabled
them
to
see,
they
reasoned
correctly;
but
of
Caroline's
strange
sufferings,
which
she
desired
so
eagerly
to
overcome
or
escape,
they
had
no
idea,
of
her
racked
nights
and
dismal
days
no
suspicion.
It
was
at
once
impossible
and
hopeless
to
explain;
to
wait
and
endure
was
her
only
plan.
Many
that
want
food
and
clothing
have
cheerier
lives
and
brighter
prospects
than
she
had;
many,
harassed
by
poverty,
are
in
a
strait
less
afflictive.
"Now,
is
your
mind
quieted?"
inquired
Shirley.
"Will
you
consent
to
stay
at
home?"
"I
shall
not
leave
it
against
the
approbation
of
my
friends,"
was
the
reply;
"but
I
think
in
time
they
will
be
obliged
to
think
as
I
do."
During
this
conversation
Mrs.
Pryor
looked
far
from
easy.
Her
extreme
habitual
reserve
would
rarely
permit
her
to
talk
freely
or
to
interrogate
others
closely.
She
could
think
a
multitude
of
questions
she
never
ventured
to
put,
give
advice
in
her
mind
which
her
tongue
never
delivered.
Had
she
been
alone
with
Caroline,
she
might
possibly
have
said
something
to
the
point:
Miss
Keeldar's
presence,
accustomed
as
she
was
to
it,
sealed
her
lips.
Now,
as
on
a
thousand
other
occasions,
inexplicable
nervous
scruples
kept
her
back
from
interfering.
She
merely
showed
her
concern
for
Miss
Helstone
in
an
indirect
way,
by
asking
her
if
the
fire
made
her
too
warm,
placing
a
screen
between
her
chair
and
the
hearth,
closing
a
window
whence
she
imagined
a
draught
proceeded,
and
often
and
restlessly
glancing
at
her.
Shirley
resumed:
"Having
destroyed
your
plan,"
she
said,
"which
I
hope
I
have
done,
I
shall
construct
a
new
one
of
my
own.
Every
summer
I
make
an
excursion.
This
season
I
propose
spending
two
months
either
at
the
Scotch
lochs
or
the
English
lakes
that
is,
I
shall
go
there
provided
you
consent
to
accompany
me.
If
you
refuse,
I
shall
not
stir
a
foot."
"You
are
very
good,
Shirley."
"I
would
be
very
good
if
you
would
let
me.
I
have
every
disposition
to
be
good.
It
is
my
misfortune
and
habit,
I
know,
to
think
of
myself
paramount
to
anybody
else;
but
who
is
not
like
me
in
that
respect?
However,
when
Captain
Keeldar
is
made
comfortable,
accommodated
with
all
he
wants,
including
a
sensible,
genial
comrade,
it
gives
him
a
thorough
pleasure
to
devote
his
spare
efforts
to
making
that
comrade
happy.
And
should
we
not
be
happy,
Caroline,
in
the
Highlands?
We
will
go
to
the
