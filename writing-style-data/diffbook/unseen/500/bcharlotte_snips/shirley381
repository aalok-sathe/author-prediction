his
keeper,
the
three
surgeons
his
sole
society.
Thus
he
lay
through
the
diminishing
days
and
lengthening
nights
of
the
whole
drear
month
of
November.
In
the
commencement
of
his
captivity
Moore
used
feebly
to
resist
Mrs.
Horsfall.
He
hated
the
sight
of
her
rough
bulk,
and
dreaded
the
contact
of
her
hard
hands;
but
she
taught
him
docility
in
a
trice.
She
made
no
account
whatever
of
his
six
feet,
his
manly
thews
and
sinews;
she
turned
him
in
his
bed
as
another
woman
would
have
turned
a
babe
in
its
cradle.
When
he
was
good
she
addressed
him
as
"my
dear"
and
"honey,"
and
when
he
was
bad
she
sometimes
shook
him.
Did
he
attempt
to
speak
when
MacTurk
was
there,
she
lifted
her
hand
and
bade
him
"Hush!"
like
a
nurse
checking
a
forward
child.
If
she
had
not
smoked,
if
she
had
not
taken
gin,
it
would
have
been
better,
he
thought;
but
she
did
both.
Once,
in
her
absence,
he
intimated
to
MacTurk
that
"that
woman
was
a
dram
drinker."
"Pooh!
my
dear
sir,
they
are
all
so,"
was
the
reply
he
got
for
his
pains.
"But
Horsfall
has
this
virtue,"
added
the
surgeon
"drunk
or
sober,
she
always
remembers
to
obey
me."
At
length
the
latter
autumn
passed;
its
fogs,
its
rains
withdrew
from
England
their
mourning
and
their
tears;
its
winds
swept
on
to
sigh
over
lands
far
away.
Behind
November
came
deep
winter
clearness,
stillness,
frost
accompanying.
A
calm
day
had
settled
into
a
crystalline
evening.
The
world
wore
a
North
Pole
colouring;
all
its
lights
and
tints
looked
like
the
reflets[A]
of
white,
or
violet,
or
pale
green
gems.
The
hills
wore
a
lilac
blue;
the
setting
sun
had
purple
in
its
red;
the
sky
was
ice,
all
silvered
azure;
when
the
stars
rose,
they
were
of
white
crystal,
not
gold;
gray,
or
cerulean,
or
faint
emerald
hues
cool,
pure,
and
transparent
tinged
the
mass
of
the
landscape.
[A]
Find
me
an
English
word
as
good,
reader,
and
I
will
gladly
dispense
with
the
French
word.
"Reflections"
won't
do.
What
is
this
by
itself
in
a
wood
no
longer
green,
no
longer
even
russet,
a
wood
neutral
tint
this
dark
blue
moving
object?
Why,
it
is
a
schoolboy
a
Briarfield
grammar
school
boy
who
has
left
his
companions,
now
trudging
home
by
the
highroad,
and
is
seeking
a
certain
tree,
with
a
certain
mossy
mound
at
its
root,
convenient
as
a
seat.
Why
is
he
lingering
here?
The
air
is
cold
and
the
time
wears
late.
He
sits
down.
What
is
he
thinking
about?
Does
he
feel
the
chaste
charm
Nature
wears
to
night?
A
pearl
white
moon
smiles
through
the
gray
trees;
does
he
care
for
her
smile?
Impossible
to
say;
for
he
is
silent,
and
his
countenance
does
not
speak.
As
yet
it
is
no
mirror
to
reflect
sensation,
but
rather
a
mask
to
conceal
it.
This
boy
is
a
stripling
of
fifteen
slight,
and
tall
of
his
years.
