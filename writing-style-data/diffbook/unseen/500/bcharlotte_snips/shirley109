but
they
must
come
and
see.
Jessy
was
about
to
reply,
when
one
of
the
boys
unexpectedly
broke
in,
"I
know
that
Miss
Helstone
you
have
all
been
palavering
about.
She's
an
ugly
girl.
I
hate
her.
I
hate
all
womenites.
I
wonder
what
they
were
made
for."
"Martin!"
said
his
father,
for
Martin
it
was.
The
lad
only
answered
by
turning
his
cynical
young
face,
half
arch,
half
truculent,
towards
the
paternal
chair.
"Martin,
my
lad,
thou'rt
a
swaggering
whelp
now;
thou
wilt
some
day
be
an
outrageous
puppy.
But
stick
to
those
sentiments
of
thine.
See,
I'll
write
down
the
words
now
i'
my
pocket
book."
(The
senior
took
out
a
morocco
covered
book,
and
deliberately
wrote
therein.)
"Ten
years
hence,
Martin,
if
thou
and
I
be
both
alive
at
that
day,
I'll
remind
thee
of
that
speech."
"I'll
say
the
same
then.
I
mean
always
to
hate
women.
They're
such
dolls;
they
do
nothing
but
dress
themselves
finely,
and
go
swimming
about
to
be
admired.
I'll
never
marry.
I'll
be
a
bachelor."
"Stick
to
it!
stick
to
it!
Hesther"
(addressing
his
wife),
"I
was
like
him
when
I
was
his
age
a
regular
misogamist;
and,
behold!
by
the
time
I
was
three
and
twenty
being
then
a
tourist
in
France
and
Italy,
and
the
Lord
knows
where
I
curled
my
hair
every
night
before
I
went
to
bed,
and
wore
a
ring
i'
my
ear,
and
would
have
worn
one
i'
my
nose
if
it
had
been
the
fashion,
and
all
that
I
might
make
myself
pleasing
and
charming
to
the
ladies.
Martin
will
do
the
like."
"Will
I?
Never!
I've
more
sense.
What
a
guy
you
were,
father!
As
to
dressing,
I
make
this
vow:
I'll
never
dress
more
finely
than
as
you
see
me
at
present.
Mr.
Moore,
I'm
clad
in
blue
cloth
from
top
to
toe,
and
they
laugh
at
me,
and
call
me
sailor
at
the
grammar
school.
I
laugh
louder
at
them,
and
say
they
are
all
magpies
and
parrots,
with
their
coats
one
colour,
and
their
waistcoats
another,
and
their
trousers
a
third.
I'll
always
wear
blue
cloth,
and
nothing
but
blue
cloth.
It
is
beneath
a
human
being's
dignity
to
dress
himself
in
parti
coloured
garments."
"Ten
years
hence,
Martin,
no
tailor's
shop
will
have
choice
of
colours
varied
enough
for
thy
exacting
taste;
no
perfumer's
stores
essences
exquisite
enough
for
thy
fastidious
senses."
Martin
looked
disdain,
but
vouchsafed
no
further
reply.
Meantime
Mark,
who
for
some
minutes
had
been
rummaging
amongst
a
pile
of
books
on
a
side
table,
took
the
word.
He
spoke
in
a
peculiarly
slow,
quiet
voice,
and
with
an
expression
of
still
irony
in
his
face
not
easy
to
describe.
"Mr.
Moore,"
said
he,
"you
think
perhaps
it
was
a
compliment
on
Miss
Caroline
Helstone's
part
to
say
you
were
not
sentimental.
I
thought
you
appeared
confused
when
my
sisters
told
you
the
words,
as
if
you
felt
flattered.
You
turned
red,
just
like
a
