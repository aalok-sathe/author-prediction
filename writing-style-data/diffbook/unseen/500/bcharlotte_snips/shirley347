some
early
hour
of
the
day,
and
see
a
fine,
perfect
rainbow,
bright
with
promise,
gloriously
spanning
the
beclouded
welkin
of
life.
An
hour
afterwards
I
look
again:
half
the
arch
is
gone,
and
the
rest
is
faded.
Still
later,
the
stern
sky
denies
that
it
ever
wore
so
benign
a
symbol
of
hope."
"Well,
Mr.
Moore,
you
should
contend
against
these
changeful
humours.
They
are
your
besetting
sin.
One
never
knows
where
to
have
you."
"Miss
Keeldar,
I
had
once,
for
two
years,
a
pupil
who
grew
very
dear
to
me.
Henry
is
dear,
but
she
was
dearer.
Henry
never
gives
me
trouble;
she
well,
she
did.
I
think
she
vexed
me
twenty
three
hours
out
of
the
twenty
four
"
"She
was
never
with
you
above
three
hours,
or
at
the
most
six
at
a
time."
"She
sometimes
spilled
the
draught
from
my
cup,
and
stole
the
food
from
my
plate;
and
when
she
had
kept
me
unfed
for
a
day
(and
that
did
not
suit
me,
for
I
am
a
man
accustomed
to
take
my
meals
with
reasonable
relish,
and
to
ascribe
due
importance
to
the
rational
enjoyment
of
creature
comforts)
"
"I
know
you
do.
I
can
tell
what
sort
of
dinners
you
like
best
perfectly
well.
I
know
precisely
the
dishes
you
prefer
"
"She
robbed
these
dishes
of
flavour,
and
made
a
fool
of
me
besides.
I
like
to
sleep
well.
In
my
quiet
days,
when
I
was
my
own
man,
I
never
quarrelled
with
the
night
for
being
long,
nor
cursed
my
bed
for
its
thorns.
She
changed
all
this."
"Mr.
Moore
"
"And
having
taken
from
me
peace
of
mind
and
ease
of
life,
she
took
from
me
herself
quite
coolly,
just
as
if,
when
she
was
gone,
the
world
would
be
all
the
same
to
me.
I
knew
I
should
see
her
again
at
some
time.
At
the
end
of
two
years,
it
fell
out
that
we
encountered
again
under
her
own
roof,
where
she
was
mistress.
How
do
you
think
she
bore
herself
towards
me,
Miss
Keeldar?"
"Like
one
who
had
profited
well
by
lessons
learned
from
yourself."
"She
received
me
haughtily.
She
meted
out
a
wide
space
between
us,
and
kept
me
aloof
by
the
reserved
gesture,
the
rare
and
alienated
glance,
the
word
calmly
civil."
"She
was
an
excellent
pupil!
Having
seen
you
distant,
she
at
once
learned
to
withdraw.
Pray,
sir,
admire
in
her
hauteur
a
careful
improvement
on
your
own
coolness."
"Conscience,
and
honour,
and
the
most
despotic
necessity
dragged
me
apart
from
her,
and
kept
me
sundered
with
ponderous
fetters.
She
was
free:
she
might
have
been
clement."
"Never
free
to
compromise
her
self
respect,
to
seek
where
she
had
been
shunned."
"Then
she
was
inconsistent;
she
tantalized
as
before.
When
I
thought
I
had
made
up
my
mind
to
seeing
in
her
only
a
lofty
stranger,
she
would
suddenly
show
me
such
a
glimpse
of
loving
simplicity
she
would
warm
me
with
such
a
