sort
of
tacit
antipathy;
an
old
servant,
who
had
lived
with
Mrs.
James
Helstone
for
a
short
time
after
her
marriage,
whenever
she
referred
to
her
former
mistress,
spoke
with
chilling
reserve
sometimes
she
called
her
"queer,"
sometimes
she
said
she
did
not
understand
her.
These
expressions
were
ice
to
the
daughter's
heart;
they
suggested
the
conclusion
that
it
was
perhaps
better
never
to
know
her
parent
than
to
know
her
and
not
like
her.
But
one
project
could
she
frame
whose
execution
seemed
likely
to
bring
her
a
hope
of
relief:
it
was
to
take
a
situation,
to
be
a
governess;
she
could
do
nothing
else.
A
little
incident
brought
her
to
the
point,
when
she
found
courage
to
break
her
design
to
her
uncle.
Her
long
and
late
walks
lay
always,
as
has
been
said,
on
lonely
roads;
but
in
whatever
direction
she
had
rambled
whether
along
the
drear
skirts
of
Stilbro'
Moor
or
over
the
sunny
stretch
of
Nunnely
Common
her
homeward
path
was
still
so
contrived
as
to
lead
her
near
the
Hollow.
She
rarely
descended
the
den,
but
she
visited
its
brink
at
twilight
almost
as
regularly
as
the
stars
rose
over
the
hillcrests.
Her
resting
place
was
at
a
certain
stile
under
a
certain
old
thorn.
Thence
she
could
look
down
on
the
cottage,
the
mill,
the
dewy
garden
ground,
the
still,
deep
dam;
thence
was
visible
the
well
known
counting
house
window,
from
whose
panes
at
a
fixed
hour
shot,
suddenly
bright,
the
ray
of
the
well
known
lamp.
Her
errand
was
to
watch
for
this
ray,
her
reward
to
catch
it,
sometimes
sparkling
bright
in
clear
air,
sometimes
shimmering
dim
through
mist,
and
anon
flashing
broken
between
slant
lines
of
rain
for
she
came
in
all
weathers.
There
were
nights
when
it
failed
to
appear.
She
knew
then
that
Robert
was
from
home,
and
went
away
doubly
sad;
whereas
its
kindling
rendered
her
elate,
as
though
she
saw
in
it
the
promise
of
some
indefinite
hope.
If,
while
she
gazed,
a
shadow
bent
between
the
light
and
lattice,
her
heart
leaped.
That
eclipse
was
Robert;
she
had
seen
him.
She
would
return
home
comforted,
carrying
in
her
mind
a
clearer
vision
of
his
aspect,
a
distincter
recollection
of
his
voice,
his
smile,
his
bearing;
and
blent
with
these
impressions
was
often
a
sweet
persuasion
that,
if
she
could
get
near
him,
his
heart
might
welcome
her
presence
yet,
that
at
this
moment
he
might
be
willing
to
extend
his
hand
and
draw
her
to
him,
and
shelter
her
at
his
side
as
he
used
to
do.
That
night,
though
she
might
weep
as
usual,
she
would
fancy
her
tears
less
scalding;
the
pillow
they
watered
seemed
a
little
softer;
the
temples
pressed
to
that
pillow
ached
less.
The
shortest
path
from
the
Hollow
to
the
rectory
wound
near
a
certain
mansion,
the
same
under
whose
lone
walls
Malone
passed
on
that
night
journey
mentioned
in
an
early
chapter
of
this
work
