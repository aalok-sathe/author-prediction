you,
Mr.
Sympson,
to
ask
me?"
"I
insist
upon
knowing."
"You
don't
go
the
way
to
know."
"My
family
respectability
shall
not
be
compromised."
"A
good
resolution;
keep
it."
"Madam,
it
is
you
who
shall
keep
it."
"Impossible,
sir,
since
I
form
no
part
of
your
family."
"Do
you
disown
us?"
"I
disdain
your
dictatorship."
"Whom
will
you
marry,
Miss
Keeldar?"
"Not
Mr.
Sam
Wynne,
because
I
scorn
him;
not
Sir
Philip
Nunnely,
because
I
only
esteem
him."
"Whom
have
you
in
your
eye?"
"Four
rejected
candidates."
"Such
obstinacy
could
not
be
unless
you
were
under
improper
influence."
"What
do
you
mean?
There
are
certain
phrases
potent
to
make
my
blood
boil.
Improper
influence!
What
old
woman's
cackle
is
that?"
"Are
you
a
young
lady?"
"I
am
a
thousand
times
better:
I
am
an
honest
woman,
and
as
such
I
will
be
treated."
"Do
you
know"
(leaning
mysteriously
forward,
and
speaking
with
ghastly
solemnity)
"do
you
know
the
whole
neighbourhood
teems
with
rumours
respecting
you
and
a
bankrupt
tenant
of
yours,
the
foreigner
Moore?"
"Does
it?"
"It
does.
Your
name
is
in
every
mouth."
"It
honours
the
lips
it
crosses,
and
I
wish
to
the
gods
it
may
purify
them."
"Is
it
that
person
who
has
power
to
influence
you?"
"Beyond
any
whose
cause
you
have
advocated."
"Is
it
he
you
will
marry?"
"He
is
handsome,
and
manly,
and
commanding."
"You
declare
it
to
my
face!
The
Flemish
knave!
the
low
trader!"
"He
is
talented,
and
venturous,
and
resolute.
Prince
is
on
his
brow,
and
ruler
in
his
bearing."
"She
glories
in
it!
She
conceals
nothing!
No
shame,
no
fear!"
"When
we
speak
the
name
of
Moore,
shame
should
be
forgotten
and
fear
discarded.
The
Moores
know
only
honour
and
courage."
"I
say
she
is
mad."
"You
have
taunted
me
till
my
blood
is
up;
you
have
worried
me
till
I
turn
again."
"That
Moore
is
the
brother
of
my
son's
tutor.
Would
you
let
the
usher
call
you
sister?"
Bright
and
broad
shone
Shirley's
eye
as
she
fixed
it
on
her
questioner
now.
"No,
no;
not
for
a
province
of
possession,
not
for
a
century
of
life."
"You
cannot
separate
the
husband
from
his
family."
"What
then?"
"Mr.
Louis
Moore's
sister
you
will
be."
"Mr.
Sympson,
I
am
sick
at
heart
with
all
this
weak
trash;
I
will
bear
no
more.
Your
thoughts
are
not
my
thoughts,
your
aims
are
not
my
aims,
your
gods
are
not
my
gods.
We
do
not
view
things
in
the
same
light;
we
do
not
measure
them
by
the
same
standard;
we
hardly
speak
in
the
same
tongue.
Let
us
part."
"It
is
not,"
she
resumed,
much
excited
"it
is
not
that
I
hate
you;
you
are
a
good
sort
of
man.
Perhaps
you
mean
well
in
your
way.
But
we
cannot
suit;
we
are
ever
at
variance.
You
annoy
me
with
small
meddling,
with
petty
tyranny;
you
exasperate
my
temper,
and
make
and
keep
me
passionate.
As
to
your
small
maxims,
your
