of
coming
evil,
and
a
manhood
drenched
and
blighted
by
the
pitiless
descent
of
the
storm,
could
painfully
impress
the
mind,
his
probably
was
impressed
in
no
golden
characters.
If,
however,
he
had
a
great
end
of
restoration
in
view,
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
employ
great
means
for
its
attainment.
He
was
obliged
to
be
content
with
the
day
of
small
things.
When
he
came
to
Yorkshire,
he
whose
ancestors
had
owned
warehouses
in
this
seaport,
and
factories
in
that
inland
town,
had
possessed
their
town
house
and
their
country
seat
saw
no
way
open
to
him
but
to
rent
a
cloth
mill
in
an
out
of
the
way
nook
of
an
out
of
the
way
district;
to
take
a
cottage
adjoining
it
for
his
residence,
and
to
add
to
his
possessions,
as
pasture
for
his
horse,
and
space
for
his
cloth
tenters,
a
few
acres
of
the
steep,
rugged
land
that
lined
the
hollow
through
which
his
mill
stream
brawled.
All
this
he
held
at
a
somewhat
high
rent
(for
these
war
times
were
hard,
and
everything
was
dear)
of
the
trustees
of
the
Fieldhead
estate,
then
the
property
of
a
minor.
At
the
time
this
history
commences,
Robert
Moore
had
lived
but
two
years
in
the
district,
during
which
period
he
had
at
least
proved
himself
possessed
of
the
quality
of
activity.
The
dingy
cottage
was
converted
into
a
neat,
tasteful
residence.
Of
part
of
the
rough
land
he
had
made
garden
ground,
which
he
cultivated
with
singular,
even
with
Flemish,
exactness
and
care.
As
to
the
mill,
which
was
an
old
structure,
and
fitted
up
with
old
machinery,
now
become
inefficient
and
out
of
date,
he
had
from
the
first
evinced
the
strongest
contempt
for
all
its
arrangements
and
appointments.
His
aim
had
been
to
effect
a
radical
reform,
which
he
had
executed
as
fast
as
his
very
limited
capital
would
allow;
and
the
narrowness
of
that
capital,
and
consequent
check
on
his
progress,
was
a
restraint
which
galled
his
spirit
sorely.
Moore
ever
wanted
to
push
on.
"Forward"
was
the
device
stamped
upon
his
soul;
but
poverty
curbed
him.
Sometimes
(figuratively)
he
foamed
at
the
mouth
when
the
reins
were
drawn
very
tight.
In
this
state
of
feeling,
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
he
would
deliberate
much
as
to
whether
his
advance
was
or
was
not
prejudicial
to
others.
Not
being
a
native,
nor
for
any
length
of
time
a
resident
of
the
neighbourhood,
he
did
not
sufficiently
care
when
the
new
inventions
threw
the
old
workpeople
out
of
employ.
He
never
asked
himself
where
those
to
whom
he
no
longer
paid
weekly
wages
found
daily
bread;
and
in
this
negligence
he
only
resembled
thousands
besides,
on
whom
the
starving
poor
of
Yorkshire
seemed
to
have
a
closer
claim.
The
period
of
which
I
write
was
an
overshadowed
one
in
British
history,
and
especially
in
the
history
of
the
northern
provinces.
War
was
then
at
its
height.
Europe
was
all
involved
