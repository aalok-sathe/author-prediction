this
house
contains
is
at
Mr.
Moore's,
Mr.
Helstone's,
and
the
soldiers'
service.
Do
that
first."
While
the
order
was
being
executed,
Shirley
moved
away
from
her
friends,
and
stood
at
the
hall
window,
silent,
unapproachable.
When
Mrs.
Gill
came
back,
she
turned.
The
purple
flush
which
painful
excitement
kindles
on
a
pale
cheek
glowed
on
hers;
the
spark
which
displeasure
lights
in
a
dark
eye
fired
her
glance.
"Let
the
contents
of
the
larder
and
the
wine
cellar
be
brought
up,
put
into
the
hay
carts,
and
driven
down
to
the
Hollow.
If
there
does
not
happen
to
be
much
bread
or
much
meat
in
the
house,
go
to
the
butcher
and
baker,
and
desire
them
to
send
what
they
have.
But
I
will
see
for
myself."
She
moved
off.
"All
will
be
right
soon;
she
will
get
over
it
in
an
hour,"
whispered
Caroline
to
Mrs.
Pryor.
"Go
upstairs,
dear
madam,"
she
added
affectionately,
"and
try
to
be
as
calm
and
easy
as
you
can.
The
truth
is,
Shirley
will
blame
herself
more
than
you
before
the
day
is
over."
By
dint
of
a
few
more
gentle
assurances
and
persuasions,
Miss
Helstone
contrived
to
soothe
the
agitated
lady.
Having
accompanied
her
to
her
apartment,
and
promised
to
rejoin
her
there
when
things
were
settled,
Caroline
left
her
to
see,
as
she
said,
"if
she
could
be
useful."
She
presently
found
that
she
could
be
very
useful;
for
the
retinue
of
servants
at
Fieldhead
was
by
no
means
numerous,
and
just
now
their
mistress
found
plenty
of
occupation
for
all
the
hands
at
her
command,
and
for
her
own
also.
The
delicate
good
nature
and
dexterous
activity
which
Caroline
brought
to
the
aid
of
the
housekeeper
and
maids
all
somewhat
scared
by
their
lady's
unwonted
mood
did
a
world
of
good
at
once;
it
helped
the
assistants
and
appeased
the
directress.
A
chance
glance
and
smile
from
Caroline
moved
Shirley
to
an
answering
smile
directly.
The
former
was
carrying
a
heavy
basket
up
the
cellar
stairs.
"This
is
a
shame!"
cried
Shirley,
running
to
her.
"It
will
strain
your
arm."
She
took
it
from
her,
and
herself
bore
it
out
into
the
yard.
The
cloud
of
temper
was
dispelled
when
she
came
back;
the
flash
in
her
eye
was
melted;
the
shade
on
her
forehead
vanished.
She
resumed
her
usual
cheerful
and
cordial
manner
to
those
about
her,
tempering
her
revived
spirits
with
a
little
of
the
softness
of
shame
at
her
previous
unjust
anger.
She
was
still
superintending
the
lading
of
the
cart,
when
a
gentleman
entered
the
yard
and
approached
her
ere
she
was
aware
of
his
presence.
"I
hope
I
see
Miss
Keeldar
well
this
morning?"
he
said,
examining
with
rather
significant
scrutiny
her
still
flushed
face.
She
gave
him
a
look,
and
then
again
bent
to
her
employment
without
reply.
A
pleasant
enough
smile
played
on
her
lips,
but
she
hid
it.
The
gentleman
repeated
his
salutation,
stooping,
that
it
might
reach
her
ear
with
