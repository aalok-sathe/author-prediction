for.
But
never
again
say
I
am
too
kind.
You
pierce
my
heart,
child!"
"But,
my
dear
madam
this
generosity
I
have
no
claim
"
"Hush!
you
must
not
talk
about
it.
There
are
some
things
we
cannot
bear
to
hear.
Oh!
it
is
late
to
begin,
but
I
may
yet
live
a
few
years.
I
can
never
wipe
out
the
past,
but
perhaps
a
brief
space
in
the
future
may
yet
be
mine."
Mrs.
Pryor
seemed
deeply
agitated.
Large
tears
trembled
in
her
eyes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks.
Caroline
kissed
her,
in
her
gentle,
caressing
way,
saying
softly,
"I
love
you
dearly.
Don't
cry."
But
the
lady's
whole
frame
seemed
shaken.
She
sat
down,
bent
her
head
to
her
knee,
and
wept
aloud.
Nothing
could
console
her
till
the
inward
storm
had
had
its
way.
At
last
the
agony
subsided
of
itself.
"Poor
thing!"
she
murmured,
returning
Caroline's
kiss,
"poor
lonely
lamb!
But
come,"
she
added
abruptly
"come;
we
must
go
home."
For
a
short
distance
Mrs.
Pryor
walked
very
fast.
By
degrees,
however,
she
calmed
down
to
her
wonted
manner,
fell
into
her
usual
characteristic
pace
a
peculiar
one,
like
all
her
movements
and
by
the
time
they
reached
Fieldhead
she
had
re
entered
into
herself.
The
outside
was,
as
usual,
still
and
shy.
Only
half
of
Moore's
activity
and
resolution
had
been
seen
in
his
defence
of
the
mill;
he
showed
the
other
half
(and
a
terrible
half
it
was)
in
the
indefatigable,
the
relentless
assiduity
with
which
he
pursued
the
leaders
of
the
riot.
The
mob,
the
mere
followers,
he
let
alone.
Perhaps
an
innate
sense
of
justice
told
him
that
men
misled
by
false
counsel
and
goaded
by
privations
are
not
fit
objects
of
vengeance,
and
that
he
who
would
visit
an
even
violent
act
on
the
bent
head
of
suffering
is
a
tyrant,
not
a
judge.
At
all
events,
though
he
knew
many
of
the
number,
having
recognized
them
during
the
latter
part
of
the
attack
when
day
began
to
dawn,
he
let
them
daily
pass
him
on
street
and
road
without
notice
or
threat.
The
leaders
he
did
not
know.
They
were
strangers
emissaries
from
the
large
towns.
Most
of
these
were
not
members
of
the
operative
class.
They
were
chiefly
"down
draughts,"
bankrupts,
men
always
in
debt
and
often
in
drink,
men
who
had
nothing
to
lose,
and
much,
in
the
way
of
character,
cash,
and
cleanliness,
to
gain.
These
persons
Moore
hunted
like
any
sleuth
hound,
and
well
he
liked
the
occupation.
Its
excitement
was
of
a
kind
pleasant
to
his
nature.
He
liked
it
better
than
making
cloth.
His
horse
must
have
hated
these
times,
for
it
was
ridden
both
hard
and
often.
He
almost
lived
on
the
road,
and
the
fresh
air
was
as
welcome
to
his
lungs
as
the
policeman's
quest
to
his
mood;
he
preferred
it
to
the
steam
of
dye
houses.
The
magistrates
of
the
district
must
have
dreaded
him.
They
were
slow,
timid
men;
