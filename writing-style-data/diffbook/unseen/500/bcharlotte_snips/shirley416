He
is
fond
of
poetry,
and
I
hate
it
'
"'Do
you?
That
is
news.'
"'I
absolutely
shudder
at
the
sight
of
metre
or
at
the
sound
of
rhyme
whenever
I
am
at
the
priory
or
Sir
Philip
at
Fieldhead.
Harmony,
indeed!
When
did
I
whip
up
syllabub
sonnets
or
string
stanzas
fragile
as
fragments
of
glass?
and
when
did
I
betray
a
belief
that
those
penny
beads
were
genuine
brilliants?'
"'You
might
have
the
satisfaction
of
leading
him
to
a
higher
standard,
of
improving
his
tastes.'
"'Leading
and
improving!
teaching
and
tutoring!
bearing
and
forbearing!
Pah!
my
husband
is
not
to
be
my
baby.
I
am
not
to
set
him
his
daily
lesson
and
see
that
he
learns
it,
and
give
him
a
sugar
plum
if
he
is
good,
and
a
patient,
pensive,
pathetic
lecture
if
he
is
bad.
But
it
is
like
a
tutor
to
talk
of
the
"satisfaction
of
teaching."
I
suppose
you
think
it
the
finest
employment
in
the
world.
I
don't.
I
reject
it.
Improving
a
husband!
No.
I
shall
insist
upon
my
husband
improving
me,
or
else
we
part.'
"'God
knows
it
is
needed!'
"'What
do
you
mean
by
that,
Mr.
Moore?'
"'What
I
say.
Improvement
is
imperatively
needed.'
"'If
you
were
a
woman
you
would
school
monsieur,
votre
mari,
charmingly.
It
would
just
suit
you;
schooling
is
your
vocation.'
"'May
I
ask
whether,
in
your
present
just
and
gentle
mood,
you
mean
to
taunt
me
with
being
a
tutor?'
"'Yes,
bitterly;
and
with
anything
else
you
please
any
defect
of
which
you
are
painfully
conscious.'
"'With
being
poor,
for
instance?'
"'Of
course;
that
will
sting
you.
You
are
sore
about
your
poverty;
you
brood
over
that.'
"'With
having
nothing
but
a
very
plain
person
to
offer
the
woman
who
may
master
my
heart?'
"'Exactly.
You
have
a
habit
of
calling
yourself
plain.
You
are
sensitive
about
the
cut
of
your
features
because
they
are
not
quite
on
an
Apollo
pattern.
You
abase
them
more
than
is
needful,
in
the
faint
hope
that
others
may
say
a
word
in
their
behalf
which
won't
happen.
Your
face
is
nothing
to
boast
of,
certainly
not
a
pretty
line
nor
a
pretty
tint
to
be
found
therein.'
"'Compare
it
with
your
own.'
"'It
looks
like
a
god
of
Egypt
a
great
sand
buried
stone
head;
or
rather
I
will
compare
it
to
nothing
so
lofty.
It
looks
like
Tartar.
You
are
my
mastiff's
cousin.
I
think
you
as
much
like
him
as
a
man
can
be
like
a
dog.'
"'Tartar
is
your
dear
companion.
In
summer,
when
you
rise
early,
and
run
out
into
the
fields
to
wet
your
feet
with
the
dew,
and
freshen
your
cheek
and
uncurl
your
hair
with
the
breeze,
you
always
call
him
to
follow
you.
You
call
him
sometimes
with
a
whistle
that
you
learned
from
me.
In
the
solitude
of
your
wood,
when
you
think
nobody
but
Tartar
is
listening,
you
whistle
the
very
tunes
you
imitated
from
my
lips,
