at
present
responsible
for
his
life;
it
shall
not
be
forfeited
for
half
an
hour's
idle
gossip.'
But
I
must
not
tell
you
all
she
said;
it
was
very
disagreeable.
However,
we
came
yet
again
mamma,
Miss
Keeldar,
and
I.
This
time
we
thought
we
should
conquer,
as
we
were
three
against
one,
and
Shirley
was
on
our
side.
But
Mrs.
Yorke
opened
such
a
battery."
Moore
smiled.
"What
did
she
say?"
"Things
that
astonished
us.
Shirley
laughed
at
last;
I
cried;
mamma
was
seriously
annoyed.
We
were
all
three
driven
from
the
field.
Since
that
time
I
have
only
walked
once
a
day
past
the
house,
just
for
the
satisfaction
of
looking
up
at
your
window,
which
I
could
distinguish
by
the
drawn
curtains.
I
really
dared
not
come
in."
"I
have
wished
for
you,
Caroline."
"I
did
not
know
that;
I
never
dreamt
one
instant
that
you
thought
of
me.
If
I
had
but
most
distantly
imagined
such
a
possibility
"
"Mrs.
Yorke
would
still
have
beaten
you."
"She
would
not.
Stratagem
should
have
been
tried,
if
persuasion
failed.
I
would
have
come
to
the
kitchen
door;
the
servants
should
have
let
me
in,
and
I
would
have
walked
straight
upstairs.
In
fact,
it
was
far
more
the
fear
of
intrusion
the
fear
of
yourself
that
baffled
me
than
the
fear
of
Mrs.
Yorke."
"Only
last
night
I
despaired
of
ever
seeing
you
again.
Weakness
has
wrought
terrible
depression
in
me
terrible
depression."
"And
you
sit
alone?"
"Worse
than
alone."
"But
you
must
be
getting
better,
since
you
can
leave
your
bed?"
"I
doubt
whether
I
shall
live.
I
see
nothing
for
it,
after
such
exhaustion,
but
decline."
"You
you
shall
go
home
to
the
Hollow."
"Dreariness
would
accompany,
nothing
cheerful
come
near
me."
"I
will
alter
this.
This
shall
be
altered,
were
there
ten
Mrs.
Yorkes
to
do
battle
with."
"Cary,
you
make
me
smile."
"Do
smile;
smile
again.
Shall
I
tell
you
what
I
should
like?"
"Tell
me
anything
only
keep
talking.
I
am
Saul;
but
for
music
I
should
perish."
"I
should
like
you
to
be
brought
to
the
rectory,
and
given
to
me
and
mamma."
"A
precious
gift!
I
have
not
laughed
since
they
shot
me
till
now."
"Do
you
suffer
pain,
Robert?"
"Not
so
much
pain
now;
but
I
am
hopelessly
weak,
and
the
state
of
my
mind
is
inexpressible
dark,
barren,
impotent.
Do
you
not
read
it
all
in
my
face?
I
look
a
mere
ghost."
"Altered;
yet
I
should
have
known
you
anywhere.
But
I
understand
your
feelings;
I
experienced
something
like
it.
Since
we
met,
I
too
have
been
very
ill."
"Very
ill?"
"I
thought
I
should
die.
The
tale
of
my
life
seemed
told.
Every
night,
just
at
midnight,
I
used
to
wake
from
awful
dreams;
and
the
book
lay
open
before
me
at
the
last
page,
where
was
written
'Finis.'
I
had
strange
feelings."
"You
speak
my
experience."
"I
believed
I
should
never
see
you
again;
and
I
