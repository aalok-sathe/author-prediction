the
parlour
before
Miss
Keeldar.
He
glanced
at
Miss
Helstone;
he
could
scarcely
bring
himself
to
bend
to
her.
He
glared
on
both
the
ladies.
He
looked
as
if,
had
either
of
them
been
his
wife,
he
would
have
made
a
glorious
husband
at
the
moment.
In
each
hand
he
seemed
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
clutch
one
and
gripe
her
to
death.
However,
Shirley
took
pity.
She
ceased
to
laugh;
and
Caroline
was
too
true
a
lady
to
smile
even
at
any
one
under
mortification.
Tartar
was
dismissed;
Peter
Augustus
was
soothed
for
Shirley
had
looks
and
tones
that
might
soothe
a
very
bull.
He
had
sense
to
feel
that,
since
he
could
not
challenge
the
owner
of
the
dog,
he
had
better
be
civil.
And
civil
he
tried
to
be;
and
his
attempts
being
well
received,
he
grew
presently
very
civil
and
quite
himself
again.
He
had
come,
indeed,
for
the
express
purpose
of
making
himself
charming
and
fascinating.
Rough
portents
had
met
him
on
his
first
admission
to
Fieldhead;
but
that
passage
got
over,
charming
and
fascinating
he
resolved
to
be.
Like
March,
having
come
in
like
a
lion,
he
purposed
to
go
out
like
a
lamb.
For
the
sake
of
air,
as
it
appeared,
or
perhaps
for
that
of
ready
exit
in
case
of
some
new
emergency
arising,
he
took
his
seat,
not
on
the
sofa,
where
Miss
Keeldar
offered
him
enthronization,
nor
yet
near
the
fireside,
to
which
Caroline,
by
a
friendly
sign,
gently
invited
him,
but
on
a
chair
close
to
the
door.
Being
no
longer
sullen
or
furious,
he
grew,
after
his
fashion,
constrained
and
embarrassed.
He
talked
to
the
ladies
by
fits
and
starts,
choosing
for
topics
whatever
was
most
intensely
commonplace.
He
sighed
deeply,
significantly,
at
the
close
of
every
sentence;
he
sighed
in
each
pause;
he
sighed
ere
he
opened
his
mouth.
At
last,
finding
it
desirable
to
add
ease
to
his
other
charms,
he
drew
forth
to
aid
him
an
ample
silk
pocket
handkerchief.
This
was
to
be
the
graceful
toy
with
which
his
unoccupied
hands
were
to
trifle.
He
went
to
work
with
a
certain
energy.
He
folded
the
red
and
yellow
square
cornerwise;
he
whipped
it
open
with
a
waft;
again
he
folded
it
in
narrower
compass;
he
made
of
it
a
handsome
band.
To
what
purpose
would
he
proceed
to
apply
the
ligature?
Would
he
wrap
it
about
his
throat
his
head?
Should
it
be
a
comforter
or
a
turban?
Neither.
Peter
Augustus
had
an
inventive,
an
original
genius.
He
was
about
to
show
the
ladies
graces
of
action
possessing
at
least
the
charm
of
novelty.
He
sat
on
the
chair
with
his
athletic
Irish
legs
crossed,
and
these
legs,
in
that
attitude,
he
circled
with
the
bandana
and
bound
firmly
together.
It
was
evident
he
felt
this
device
to
be
worth
an
encore;
he
repeated
it
more
than
once.
The
second
performance
sent
Shirley
to
the
window,
to
laugh
her
silent
but
irrepressible
