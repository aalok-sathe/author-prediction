morrow.
I
have
not
got
it;
he
would
not
give
it;
he
is
gone.
Strange
that
grief
should
now
almost
choke
me,
because
another
human
being's
eye
has
failed
to
greet
mine."
That
Sunday
evening,
Mr.
Malone
coming,
as
usual,
to
pass
it
with
his
rector,
Caroline
withdrew
after
tea
to
her
chamber.
Fanny,
knowing
her
habits,
had
lit
her
a
cheerful
little
fire,
as
the
weather
was
so
gusty
and
chill.
Closeted
there,
silent
and
solitary,
what
could
she
do
but
think?
She
noiselessly
paced
to
and
fro
the
carpeted
floor,
her
head
drooped,
her
hands
folded.
It
was
irksome
to
sit;
the
current
of
reflection
ran
rapidly
through
her
mind;
to
night
she
was
mutely
excited.
Mute
was
the
room,
mute
the
house.
The
double
door
of
the
study
muffled
the
voices
of
the
gentlemen.
The
servants
were
quiet
in
the
kitchen,
engaged
with
books
their
young
mistress
had
lent
them
books
which
she
had
told
them
were
"fit
for
Sunday
reading."
And
she
herself
had
another
of
the
same
sort
open
on
the
table,
but
she
could
not
read
it.
Its
theology
was
incomprehensible
to
her,
and
her
own
mind
was
too
busy,
teeming,
wandering,
to
listen
to
the
language
of
another
mind.
Then,
too,
her
imagination
was
full
of
pictures
images
of
Moore,
scenes
where
he
and
she
had
been
together;
winter
fireside
sketches;
a
glowing
landscape
of
a
hot
summer
afternoon
passed
with
him
in
the
bosom
of
Nunnely
Wood;
divine
vignettes
of
mild
spring
or
mellow
autumn
moments,
when
she
had
sat
at
his
side
in
Hollow's
Copse,
listening
to
the
call
of
the
May
cuckoo,
or
sharing
the
September
treasure
of
nuts
and
ripe
blackberries
a
wild
dessert
which
it
was
her
morning's
pleasure
to
collect
in
a
little
basket,
and
cover
with
green
leaves
and
fresh
blossoms,
and
her
afternoon's
delight
to
administer
to
Moore,
berry
by
berry,
and
nut
by
nut,
like
a
bird
feeding
its
fledgling.
Robert's
features
and
form
were
with
her;
the
sound
of
his
voice
was
quite
distinct
in
her
ear;
his
few
caresses
seemed
renewed.
But
these
joys,
being
hollow,
were,
ere
long,
crushed
in.
The
pictures
faded,
the
voice
failed,
the
visionary
clasp
melted
chill
from
her
hand,
and
where
the
warm
seal
of
lips
had
made
impress
on
her
forehead,
it
felt
now
as
if
a
sleety
rain
drop
had
fallen.
She
returned
from
an
enchanted
region
to
the
real
world:
for
Nunnely
Wood
in
June
she
saw
her
narrow
chamber;
for
the
songs
of
birds
in
alleys
she
heard
the
rain
on
her
casement;
for
the
sigh
of
the
south
wind
came
the
sob
of
the
mournful
east;
and
for
Moore's
manly
companionship
she
had
the
thin
illusion
of
her
own
dim
shadow
on
the
wall.
Turning
from
the
pale
phantom
which
reflected
herself
in
its
outline,
and
her
reverie
in
the
drooped
attitude
of
its
dim
head
and
colourless
tresses,
she
sat
down
inaction
would
suit
the
frame
of
mind
into
which
