at
Stilbro',
and
one
and
all
went
home
in
such
a
plight
as
their
wives
would
never
wish
to
witness
more.
Liverpool
started
and
snorted
like
a
river
horse
roused
amongst
his
reeds
by
thunder.
Some
of
the
American
merchants
felt
threatenings
of
apoplexy,
and
had
themselves
bled
all,
like
wise
men,
at
this
first
moment
of
prosperity,
prepared
to
rush
into
the
bowels
of
speculation,
and
to
delve
new
difficulties,
in
whose
depths
they
might
lose
themselves
at
some
future
day.
Stocks
which
had
been
accumulating
for
years
now
went
off
in
a
moment,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye.
Warehouses
were
lightened,
ships
were
laden;
work
abounded,
wages
rose;
the
good
time
seemed
come.
These
prospects
might
be
delusive,
but
they
were
brilliant
to
some
they
were
even
true.
At
that
epoch,
in
that
single
month
of
June,
many
a
solid
fortune
was
realized.
When
a
whole
province
rejoices,
the
humblest
of
its
inhabitants
tastes
a
festal
feeling;
the
sound
of
public
bells
rouses
the
most
secluded
abode,
as
if
with
a
call
to
be
gay.
And
so
Caroline
Helstone
thought,
when
she
dressed
herself
more
carefully
than
usual
on
the
day
of
this
trading
triumph,
and
went,
attired
in
her
neatest
muslin,
to
spend
the
afternoon
at
Fieldhead,
there
to
superintend
certain
millinery
preparations
for
a
great
event,
the
last
appeal
in
these
matters
being
reserved
for
her
unimpeachable
taste.
She
decided
on
the
wreath,
the
veil,
the
dress
to
be
worn
at
the
altar.
She
chose
various
robes
and
fashions
for
more
ordinary
occasions,
without
much
reference
to
the
bride's
opinion
that
lady,
indeed,
being
in
a
somewhat
impracticable
mood.
Louis
had
presaged
difficulties,
and
he
had
found
them
in
fact,
his
mistress
had
shown
herself
exquisitely
provoking,
putting
off
her
marriage
day
by
day,
week
by
week,
month
by
month,
at
first
coaxing
him
with
soft
pretences
of
procrastination,
and
in
the
end
rousing
his
whole
deliberate
but
determined
nature
to
revolt
against
her
tyranny,
at
once
so
sweet
and
so
intolerable.
It
had
needed
a
sort
of
tempest
shock
to
bring
her
to
the
point;
but
there
she
was
at
last,
fettered
to
a
fixed
day.
There
she
lay,
conquered
by
love,
and
bound
with
a
vow.
Thus
vanquished
and
restricted,
she
pined,
like
any
other
chained
denizen
of
deserts.
Her
captor
alone
could
cheer
her;
his
society
only
could
make
amends
for
the
lost
privilege
of
liberty.
In
his
absence
she
sat
or
wandered
alone,
spoke
little,
and
ate
less.
She
furthered
no
preparations
for
her
nuptials;
Louis
was
himself
obliged
to
direct
all
arrangements.
He
was
virtually
master
of
Fieldhead
weeks
before
he
became
so
nominally
the
least
presumptuous,
the
kindest
master
that
ever
was,
but
with
his
lady
absolute.
She
abdicated
without
a
word
or
a
struggle.
"Go
to
Mr.
Moore,
ask
Mr.
Moore,"
was
her
answer
when
applied
to
for
orders.
Never
was
wooer
of
wealthy
bride
so
thoroughly
absolved
from
the
subaltern
part,
so
inevitably
compelled
to
assume
