she
agreed
perfectly
well,
yet
he
was
naturally
a
social,
hospitable
man,
an
advocate
for
family
unity;
and
in
his
youth,
as
has
been
said,
he
liked
none
but
lively,
cheerful
women.
Why
he
chose
her,
how
they
contrived
to
suit
each
other,
is
a
problem
puzzling
enough,
but
which
might
soon
be
solved
if
one
had
time
to
go
into
the
analysis
of
the
case.
Suffice
it
here
to
say
that
Yorke
had
a
shadowy
side
as
well
as
a
sunny
side
to
his
character,
and
that
his
shadowy
side
found
sympathy
and
affinity
in
the
whole
of
his
wife's
uniformly
overcast
nature.
For
the
rest,
she
was
a
strong
minded
woman;
never
said
a
weak
or
a
trite
thing;
took
stern,
democratic
views
of
society,
and
rather
cynical
ones
of
human
nature;
considered
herself
perfect
and
safe,
and
the
rest
of
the
world
all
wrong.
Her
main
fault
was
a
brooding,
eternal,
immitigable
suspicion
of
all
men,
things,
creeds,
and
parties;
this
suspicion
was
a
mist
before
her
eyes,
a
false
guide
in
her
path,
wherever
she
looked,
wherever
she
turned.
It
may
be
supposed
that
the
children
of
such
a
pair
were
not
likely
to
turn
out
quite
ordinary,
commonplace
beings;
and
they
were
not.
You
see
six
of
them,
reader.
The
youngest
is
a
baby
on
the
mother's
knee.
It
is
all
her
own
yet,
and
that
one
she
has
not
yet
begun
to
doubt,
suspect,
condemn;
it
derives
its
sustenance
from
her,
it
hangs
on
her,
it
clings
to
her,
it
loves
her
above
everything
else
in
the
world.
She
is
sure
of
that,
because,
as
it
lives
by
her,
it
cannot
be
otherwise,
therefore
she
loves
it.
The
two
next
are
girls,
Rose
and
Jessy;
they
are
both
now
at
their
father's
knee;
they
seldom
go
near
their
mother,
except
when
obliged
to
do
so.
Rose,
the
elder,
is
twelve
years
old;
she
is
like
her
father
the
most
like
him
of
the
whole
group
but
it
is
a
granite
head
copied
in
ivory;
all
is
softened
in
colour
and
line.
Yorke
himself
has
a
harsh
face
his
daughter's
is
not
harsh,
neither
is
it
quite
pretty;
it
is
simple,
childlike
in
feature;
the
round
cheeks
bloom:
as
to
the
gray
eyes,
they
are
otherwise
than
childlike;
a
serious
soul
lights
them
a
young
soul
yet,
but
it
will
mature,
if
the
body
lives;
and
neither
father
nor
mother
have
a
spirit
to
compare
with
it.
Partaking
of
the
essence
of
each,
it
will
one
day
be
better
than
either
stronger,
much
purer,
more
aspiring.
Rose
is
a
still,
sometimes
a
stubborn,
girl
now.
Her
mother
wants
to
make
of
her
such
a
woman
as
she
is
herself
a
woman
of
dark
and
dreary
duties;
and
Rose
has
a
mind
full
set,
thick
sown
with
the
germs
of
ideas
her
mother
never
knew.
It
is
agony
to
her
often
to
have
these
ideas
trampled
on
and
repressed.
She
has
never
rebelled
yet;
but
if
