audible.
Mr.
Malone
had
at
length
issued
from
the
counting
house,
previously
taking
the
precaution
to
dip
his
head
and
face
in
the
stone
water
jug;
and
this
precaution,
together
with
the
sudden
alarm,
had
nearly
restored
to
him
the
possession
of
those
senses
which
the
punch
had
partially
scattered.
He
stood
with
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head,
and
his
shillelah
grasped
in
his
dexter
fist,
answering
much
at
random
the
questions
of
the
newly
arrived
party
from
the
Redhouse.
Mr.
Moore
now
appeared,
and
was
immediately
confronted
by
the
shovel
hat
and
the
shaggy
pony.
"Well,
Moore,
what
is
your
business
with
us?
I
thought
you
would
want
us
to
night
me
and
the
hetman
here
(patting
his
pony's
neck),
and
Tom
and
his
charger.
When
I
heard
your
mill
bell
I
could
sit
still
no
longer,
so
I
left
Boultby
to
finish
his
supper
alone.
But
where
is
the
enemy?
I
do
not
see
a
mask
or
a
smutted
face
present;
and
there
is
not
a
pane
of
glass
broken
in
your
windows.
Have
you
had
an
attack,
or
do
you
expect
one?"
"Oh,
not
at
all!
I
have
neither
had
one
nor
expect
one,"
answered
Moore
coolly.
"I
only
ordered
the
bell
to
be
rung
because
I
want
two
or
three
neighbours
to
stay
here
in
the
Hollow
while
I
and
a
couple
or
so
more
go
over
to
Stilbro'
Moor."
"To
Stilbro'
Moor!
What
to
do?
To
meet
the
wagons?"
"The
wagons
are
come
home
an
hour
ago."
"Then
all's
right.
What
more
would
you
have?"
"They
came
home
empty;
and
Joe
Scott
and
company
are
left
on
the
moor,
and
so
are
the
frames.
Read
that
scrawl."
Mr.
Helstone
received
and
perused
the
document
of
which
the
contents
have
before
been
given.
"Hum!
They've
only
served
you
as
they
serve
others.
But,
however,
the
poor
fellows
in
the
ditch
will
be
expecting
help
with
some
impatience.
This
is
a
wet
night
for
such
a
berth.
I
and
Tom
will
go
with
you.
Malone
may
stay
behind
and
take
care
of
the
mill.
What
is
the
matter
with
him?
His
eyes
seem
starting
out
of
his
head."
"He
has
been
eating
a
mutton
chop."
"Indeed!
Peter
Augustus,
be
on
your
guard.
Eat
no
more
mutton
chops
to
night.
You
are
left
here
in
command
of
these
premises
an
honourable
post!"
"Is
anybody
to
stay
with
me?"
"As
many
of
the
present
assemblage
as
choose.
My
lads,
how
many
of
you
will
remain
here,
and
how
many
will
go
a
little
way
with
me
and
Mr.
Moore
on
the
Stilbro'
road,
to
meet
some
men
who
have
been
waylaid
and
assaulted
by
frame
breakers?"
The
small
number
of
three
volunteered
to
go;
the
rest
preferred
staying
behind.
As
Mr.
Moore
mounted
his
horse,
the
rector
asked
him
in
a
low
voice
whether
he
had
locked
up
the
mutton
chops,
so
that
Peter
Augustus
could
not
get
at
them?
The
manufacturer
nodded
an
affirmative,
and
