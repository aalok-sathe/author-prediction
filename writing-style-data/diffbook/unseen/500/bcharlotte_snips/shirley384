out."
"You
need
not.
I
have
got
into
the
track
now.
I
shall
be
right.
Martin"
(a
little
quickly),
"how
is
Mr.
Moore?"
Martin
had
heard
certain
rumours;
it
struck
him
that
it
might
be
amusing
to
make
an
experiment.
"Going
to
die.
Nothing
can
save
him.
All
hope
flung
overboard!"
She
put
her
veil
aside.
She
looked
into
his
eyes,
and
said,
"To
die!"
"To
die.
All
along
of
the
women,
my
mother
and
the
rest.
They
did
something
about
his
bandages
that
finished
everything.
He
would
have
got
better
but
for
them.
I
am
sure
they
should
be
arrested,
cribbed,
tried,
and
brought
in
for
Botany
Bay,
at
the
very
least."
The
questioner,
perhaps,
did
nor
hear
this
judgment.
She
stood
motionless.
In
two
minutes,
without
another
word,
she
moved
forwards;
no
good
night,
no
further
inquiry.
This
was
not
amusing,
nor
what
Martin
had
calculated
on.
He
expected
something
dramatic
and
demonstrative.
It
was
hardly
worth
while
to
frighten
the
girl
if
she
would
not
entertain
him
in
return.
He
called,
"Miss
Helstone!"
She
did
not
hear
or
turn.
He
hastened
after
and
overtook
her.
"Come;
are
you
uneasy
about
what
I
said?"
"You
know
nothing
about
death,
Martin;
you
are
too
young
for
me
to
talk
to
concerning
such
a
thing."
"Did
you
believe
me?
It's
all
flummery!
Moore
eats
like
three
men.
They
are
always
making
sago
or
tapioca
or
something
good
for
him.
I
never
go
into
the
kitchen
but
there
is
a
saucepan
on
the
fire,
cooking
him
some
dainty.
I
think
I
will
play
the
old
soldier,
and
be
fed
on
the
fat
of
the
land
like
him."
"Martin!
Martin!"
Here
her
voice
trembled,
and
she
stopped.
"It
is
exceedingly
wrong
of
you,
Martin.
You
have
almost
killed
me."
Again
she
stopped.
She
leaned
against
a
tree,
trembling,
shuddering,
and
as
pale
as
death.
Martin
contemplated
her
with
inexpressible
curiosity.
In
one
sense
it
was,
as
he
would
have
expressed
it,
"nuts"
to
him
to
see
this.
It
told
him
so
much,
and
he
was
beginning
to
have
a
great
relish
for
discovering
secrets.
In
another
sense
it
reminded
him
of
what
he
had
once
felt
when
he
had
heard
a
blackbird
lamenting
for
her
nestlings,
which
Matthew
had
crushed
with
a
stone,
and
that
was
not
a
pleasant
feeling.
Unable
to
find
anything
very
appropriate
to
say
in
order
to
comfort
her,
he
began
to
cast
about
in
his
mind
what
he
could
do.
He
smiled.
The
lad's
smile
gave
wondrous
transparency
to
his
physiognomy.
"Eureka!"
he
cried.
"I'll
set
all
straight
by
and
by.
You
are
better
now,
Miss
Caroline.
Walk
forward,"
he
urged.
Not
reflecting
that
it
would
be
more
difficult
for
Miss
Helstone
than
for
himself
to
climb
a
wall
or
penetrate
a
hedge,
he
piloted
her
by
a
short
cut
which
led
to
no
gate.
The
consequence
was
he
had
to
help
her
over
some
formidable
obstacles,
and
while
he
railed
at
her
for
helplessness,
he
perfectly
