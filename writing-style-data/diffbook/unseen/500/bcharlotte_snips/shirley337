learned
then?
What
new
circumstance?"
"I
have
learned
that
she
has
just
made
her
will."
"Made
her
will?"
The
tutor
and
pupil
were
silent.
"She
told
you
that?"
asked
Moore,
when
some
minutes
had
elapsed.
"She
told
me
quite
cheerfully,
not
as
an
ominous
circumstance,
which
I
felt
it
to
be.
She
said
I
was
the
only
person
besides
her
solicitor,
Pearson
Hall,
and
Mr.
Helstone
and
Mr.
Yorke,
who
knew
anything
about
it;
and
to
me,
she
intimated,
she
wished
specially
to
explain
its
provisions."
"Go
on,
Harry."
"'Because,'
she
said,
looking
down
on
me
with
her
beautiful
eyes
oh!
they
are
beautiful,
Mr.
Moore!
I
love
them!
I
love
her!
She
is
my
star!
Heaven
must
not
claim
her!
She
is
lovely
in
this
world,
and
fitted
for
this
world.
Shirley
is
not
an
angel;
she
is
a
woman,
and
she
shall
live
with
men.
Seraphs
shall
not
have
her!
Mr.
Moore,
if
one
of
the
'sons
of
God,'
with
wings
wide
and
bright
as
the
sky,
blue
and
sounding
as
the
sea,
having
seen
that
she
was
fair,
descended
to
claim
her,
his
claim
should
be
withstood
withstood
by
me
boy
and
cripple
as
I
am."
"Henry
Sympson,
go
on,
when
I
tell
you."
"'Because,'
she
said,
'if
I
made
no
will,
and
died
before
you,
Harry,
all
my
property
would
go
to
you;
and
I
do
not
intend
that
it
should
be
so,
though
your
father
would
like
it.
But
you,'
she
said,
'will
have
his
whole
estate,
which
is
large
larger
than
Fieldhead.
Your
sisters
will
have
nothing;
so
I
have
left
them
some
money,
though
I
do
not
love
them,
both
together,
half
so
much
as
I
love
one
lock
of
your
fair
hair.'
She
said
these
words,
and
she
called
me
her
'darling,'
and
let
me
kiss
her.
She
went
on
to
tell
me
that
she
had
left
Caroline
Helstone
some
money
too;
that
this
manor
house,
with
its
furniture
and
books,
she
had
bequeathed
to
me,
as
she
did
not
choose
to
take
the
old
family
place
from
her
own
blood;
and
that
all
the
rest
of
her
property,
amounting
to
about
twelve
thousand
pounds,
exclusive
of
the
legacies
to
my
sisters
and
Miss
Helstone,
she
had
willed,
not
to
me,
seeing
I
was
already
rich,
but
to
a
good
man,
who
would
make
the
best
use
of
it
that
any
human
being
could
do
a
man,
she
said,
that
was
both
gentle
and
brave,
strong
and
merciful
a
man
that
might
not
profess
to
be
pious,
but
she
knew
he
had
the
secret
of
religion
pure
and
undefiled
before
God.
The
spirit
of
love
and
peace
was
with
him.
He
visited
the
fatherless
and
widows
in
their
affliction,
and
kept
himself
unspotted
from
the
world.
Then
she
asked,
'Do
you
approve
what
I
have
done,
Harry?'
I
could
not
answer.
My
tears
choked
me,
as
they
do
now."
Mr.
Moore
allowed
his
pupil
a
moment
to
contend
with
and
master
his
