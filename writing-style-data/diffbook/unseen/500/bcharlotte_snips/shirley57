him.
Mr.
Moore,
while
enjoying
the
genial
glow,
kept
his
eyes
directed
towards
the
glittering
brasses
on
the
shelf
above.
Chancing
for
an
instant
to
look
down,
his
glance
rested
on
an
uplifted
face,
flushed,
smiling,
happy,
shaded
with
silky
curls,
lit
with
fine
eyes.
Sarah
was
gone
into
the
parlour
with
the
tray;
a
lecture
from
her
mistress
detained
her
there.
Moore
placed
his
hand
a
moment
on
his
young
cousin's
shoulder,
stooped,
and
left
a
kiss
on
her
forehead.
"Oh!"
said
she,
as
if
the
action
had
unsealed
her
lips,
"I
was
miserable
when
I
thought
you
would
not
come.
I
am
almost
too
happy
now.
Are
you
happy,
Robert?
Do
you
like
to
come
home?"
"I
think
I
do
to
night,
at
least."
"Are
you
certain
you
are
not
fretting
about
your
frames,
and
your
business,
and
the
war?"
"Not
just
now."
"Are
you
positive
you
don't
feel
Hollow's
Cottage
too
small
for
you,
and
narrow,
and
dismal?"
"At
this
moment,
no."
"Can
you
affirm
that
you
are
not
bitter
at
heart
because
rich
and
great
people
forget
you?"
"No
more
questions.
You
are
mistaken
if
you
think
I
am
anxious
to
curry
favour
with
rich
and
great
people.
I
only
want
means
a
position
a
career."
"Which
your
own
talent
and
goodness
shall
win
you.
You
were
made
to
be
great;
you
shall
be
great."
"I
wonder
now,
if
you
spoke
honestly
out
of
your
heart,
what
recipe
you
would
give
me
for
acquiring
this
same
greatness;
but
I
know
it
better
than
you
know
it
yourself.
Would
it
be
efficacious?
Would
it
work?
Yes
poverty,
misery,
bankruptcy.
Oh,
life
is
not
what
you
think
it,
Lina!"
"But
you
are
what
I
think
you."
"I
am
not."
"You
are
better,
then?"
"Far
worse."
"No;
far
better.
I
know
you
are
good."
"How
do
you
know
it?"
"You
look
so,
and
I
feel
you
are
so."
"Where
do
you
feel
it?"
"In
my
heart."
"Ah!
You
judge
me
with
your
heart,
Lina:
you
should
judge
me
with
your
head."
"I
do;
and
then
I
am
quite
proud
of
you.
Robert,
you
cannot
tell
all
my
thoughts
about
you."
Mr.
Moore's
dark
face
mustered
colour;
his
lips
smiled,
and
yet
were
compressed;
his
eyes
laughed,
and
yet
he
resolutely
knit
his
brow.
"Think
meanly
of
me,
Lina,"
said
he.
"Men,
in
general,
are
a
sort
of
scum,
very
different
to
anything
of
which
you
have
an
idea.
I
make
no
pretension
to
be
better
than
my
fellows."
"If
you
did,
I
should
not
esteem
you
so
much.
It
is
because
you
are
modest
that
I
have
such
confidence
in
your
merit."
"Are
you
flattering
me?"
he
demanded,
turning
sharply
upon
her,
and
searching
her
face
with
an
eye
of
acute
penetration.
"No,"
she
said
softly,
laughing
at
his
sudden
quickness.
She
seemed
to
think
it
unnecessary
to
proffer
any
eager
disavowal
of
the
charge.
"You
don't
care
whether
I
think
you
flatter
me
or
not?"
"No."
"You
are
