the
rescue
party
set
out.
Cheerfulness,
it
would
appear,
is
a
matter
which
depends
fully
as
much
on
the
state
of
things
within
as
on
the
state
of
things
without
and
around
us.
I
make
this
trite
remark,
because
I
happen
to
know
that
Messrs.
Helstone
and
Moore
trotted
forth
from
the
mill
yard
gates,
at
the
head
of
their
very
small
company,
in
the
best
possible
spirits.
When
a
ray
from
a
lantern
(the
three
pedestrians
of
the
party
carried
each
one)
fell
on
Mr.
Moore's
face,
you
could
see
an
unusual,
because
a
lively,
spark
dancing
in
his
eyes,
and
a
new
found
vivacity
mantling
on
his
dark
physiognomy;
and
when
the
rector's
visage
was
illuminated,
his
hard
features
were
revealed
all
agrin
and
ashine
with
glee.
Yet
a
drizzling
night,
a
somewhat
perilous
expedition,
you
would
think
were
not
circumstances
calculated
to
enliven
those
exposed
to
the
wet
and
engaged
in
the
adventure.
If
any
member
or
members
of
the
crew
who
had
been
at
work
on
Stilbro'
Moor
had
caught
a
view
of
this
party,
they
would
have
had
great
pleasure
in
shooting
either
of
the
leaders
from
behind
a
wall:
and
the
leaders
knew
this;
and
the
fact
is,
being
both
men
of
steely
nerves
and
steady
beating
hearts,
were
elate
with
the
knowledge.
I
am
aware,
reader,
and
you
need
not
remind
me,
that
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
for
a
parson
to
be
warlike;
I
am
aware
that
he
should
be
a
man
of
peace.
I
have
some
faint
outline
of
an
idea
of
what
a
clergyman's
mission
is
amongst
mankind,
and
I
remember
distinctly
whose
servant
he
is,
whose
message
he
delivers,
whose
example
he
should
follow;
yet,
with
all
this,
if
you
are
a
parson
hater,
you
need
not
expect
me
to
go
along
with
you
every
step
of
your
dismal,
downward
tending,
unchristian
road;
you
need
not
expect
me
to
join
in
your
deep
anathemas,
at
once
so
narrow
and
so
sweeping,
in
your
poisonous
rancour,
so
intense
and
so
absurd,
against
"the
cloth;"
to
lift
up
my
eyes
and
hands
with
a
Supplehough,
or
to
inflate
my
lungs
with
a
Barraclough,
in
horror
and
denunciation
of
the
diabolical
rector
of
Briarfield.
He
was
not
diabolical
at
all.
The
evil
simply
was
he
had
missed
his
vocation.
He
should
have
been
a
soldier,
and
circumstances
had
made
him
a
priest.
For
the
rest,
he
was
a
conscientious,
hard
headed,
hard
handed,
brave,
stern,
implacable,
faithful
little
man;
a
man
almost
without
sympathy,
ungentle,
prejudiced,
and
rigid,
but
a
man
true
to
principle,
honourable,
sagacious,
and
sincere.
It
seems
to
me,
reader,
that
you
cannot
always
cut
out
men
to
fit
their
profession,
and
that
you
ought
not
to
curse
them
because
their
profession
sometimes
hangs
on
them
ungracefully.
Nor
will
I
curse
Helstone,
clerical
Cossack
as
he
was.
Yet
he
was
cursed,
and
by
many
of
his
own
parishioners,
as
by
others
he
was
adored
which
is
the
frequent
fate
