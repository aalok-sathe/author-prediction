He
does
not
dogmatize
to
his
wife."
"My
wife
is
a
hard
working,
plain
woman;
time
and
trouble
has
ta'en
all
the
conceit
out
of
her.
But
that
is
not
the
case
with
you,
young
misses.
And
then
you
reckon
to
have
so
much
knowledge;
and
i'
my
thoughts
it's
only
superficial
sort
o'
vanities
you're
acquainted
with.
I
can
tell
happen
a
year
sin'
one
day
Miss
Caroline
coming
into
our
counting
house
when
I
war
packing
up
summat
behind
t'
great
desk,
and
she
didn't
see
me,
and
she
brought
a
slate
wi'
a
sum
on
it
to
t'
maister.
It
war
only
a
bit
of
a
sum
in
practice,
that
our
Harry
would
have
settled
i'
two
minutes.
She
couldn't
do
it.
Mr.
Moore
had
to
show
her
how.
And
when
he
did
show
her,
she
couldn't
understand
him."
"Nonsense,
Joe!"
"Nay,
it's
no
nonsense.
And
Miss
Shirley
there
reckons
to
hearken
to
t'
maister
when
he's
talking
ower
trade,
so
attentive
like,
as
if
she
followed
him
word
for
word,
and
all
war
as
clear
as
a
lady's
looking
glass
to
her
een;
and
all
t'
while
she's
peeping
and
peeping
out
o'
t'
window
to
see
if
t'
mare
stands
quiet;
and
then
looking
at
a
bit
of
a
splash
on
her
riding
skirt;
and
then
glancing
glegly
round
at
wer
counting
house
cobwebs
and
dust,
and
thinking
what
mucky
folk
we
are,
and
what
a
grand
ride
she'll
have
just
i'
now
ower
Nunnely
Common.
She
hears
no
more
o'
Mr.
Moore's
talk
nor
if
he
spake
Hebrew."
"Joe,
you
are
a
real
slanderer.
I
would
give
you
your
answer,
only
the
people
are
coming
out
of
church.
We
must
leave
you.
Man
of
prejudice,
good
bye.
William,
good
bye.
Children,
come
up
to
Fieldhead
to
morrow,
and
you
shall
choose
what
you
like
best
out
of
Mrs.
Gill's
store
room."
The
hour
was
now
that
of
dusk.
A
clear
air
favoured
the
kindling
of
the
stars.
"There
will
be
just
light
enough
to
show
me
the
way
home,"
said
Miss
Keeldar,
as
she
prepared
to
take
leave
of
Caroline
at
the
rectory
garden
door.
"You
must
not
go
alone,
Shirley;
Fanny
shall
accompany
you."
"That
she
shall
not.
Of
what
need
I
be
afraid
in
my
own
parish?
I
would
walk
from
Fieldhead
to
the
church
any
fine
midsummer
night,
three
hours
later
than
this,
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
seeing
the
stars
and
the
chance
of
meeting
a
fairy."
"But
just
wait
till
the
crowd
is
cleared
away."
"Agreed.
There
are
the
five
Misses
Armitage
streaming
by.
Here
comes
Mrs.
Sykes's
phaeton,
Mr.
Wynne's
close
carriage,
Mrs.
Birtwhistle's
car.
I
don't
wish
to
go
through
the
ceremony
of
bidding
them
all
good
bye,
so
we
will
step
into
the
garden
and
take
shelter
amongst
the
laburnums
for
an
instant."
The
rectors,
their
curates,
and
their
churchwardens
now
issued
from
the
church
porch.
There
was
a
great
confabulation,
shaking
of
hands,
congratulation
on
