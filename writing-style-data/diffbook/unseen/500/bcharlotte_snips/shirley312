and
said
that
if
Miss
Keeldar
was
no
more
than
that,
she
was
less
than
he
took
her
to
be;
for
I
was
but
a
dim
eyed,
short
sighted
little
chap.
I'm
afraid
I
am
a
poor
unfortunate,
Miss
Caroline
Helstone.
I
am
a
cripple,
you
know."
"Never
mind,
Henry,
you
are
a
very
nice
little
fellow;
and
if
God
has
not
given
you
health
and
strength,
He
has
given
you
a
good
disposition
and
an
excellent
heart
and
brain."
"I
shall
be
despised.
I
sometimes
think
both
Shirley
and
you
despise
me."
"Listen,
Henry.
Generally,
I
don't
like
schoolboys.
I
have
a
great
horror
of
them.
They
seem
to
me
little
ruffians,
who
take
an
unnatural
delight
in
killing
and
tormenting
birds,
and
insects,
and
kittens,
and
whatever
is
weaker
than
themselves.
But
you
are
so
different
I
am
quite
fond
of
you.
You
have
almost
as
much
sense
as
a
man
(far
more,
God
wot,"
she
muttered
to
herself,
"than
many
men);
you
are
fond
of
reading,
and
you
can
talk
sensibly
about
what
you
read."
"I
am
fond
of
reading.
I
know
I
have
sense,
and
I
know
I
have
feeling."
Miss
Keeldar
here
entered.
"Henry,"
she
said,
"I
have
brought
your
lunch
here.
I
shall
prepare
it
for
you
myself."
She
placed
on
the
table
a
glass
of
new
milk,
a
plate
of
something
which
looked
not
unlike
leather,
and
a
utensil
which
resembled
a
toasting
fork.
"What
are
you
two
about,"
she
continued,
"ransacking
Mr.
Moore's
desk?"
"Looking
at
your
old
copy
books,"
returned
Caroline.
"My
old
copy
books?"
"French
exercise
books.
Look
here!
They
must
be
held
precious;
they
are
kept
carefully."
She
showed
the
bundle.
Shirley
snatched
it
up.
"Did
not
know
one
was
in
existence,"
she
said.
"I
thought
the
whole
lot
had
long
since
lit
the
kitchen
fire,
or
curled
the
maid's
hair
at
Sympson
Grove.
What
made
you
keep
them,
Henry?"
"It
is
not
my
doing.
I
should
not
have
thought
of
it.
It
never
entered
my
head
to
suppose
copy
books
of
value.
Mr.
Moore
put
them
by
in
the
inner
drawer
of
his
desk.
Perhaps
he
forgot
them."
"C'est
cela.
He
forgot
them,
no
doubt,"
echoed
Shirley.
"They
are
extremely
well
written,"
she
observed
complacently.
"What
a
giddy
girl
you
were,
Shirley,
in
those
days!
I
remember
you
so
well.
A
slim,
light
creature
whom,
though
you
were
so
tall,
I
could
lift
off
the
floor.
I
see
you
with
your
long,
countless
curls
on
your
shoulders,
and
your
streaming
sash.
You
used
to
make
Mr.
Moore
lively
that
is,
at
first.
I
believe
you
grieved
him
after
a
while."
Shirley
turned
the
closely
written
pages
and
said
nothing.
Presently
she
observed,
"That
was
written
one
winter
afternoon.
It
was
a
description
of
a
snow
scene."
"I
remember,"
said
Henry.
"Mr.
Moore,
when
he
read
it,
cried,
'Voila
le
Francais
gagne!'
He
said
it
was
well
done.
Afterwards
you
made
him
draw,
in
sepia,
the
landscape
you
described."
