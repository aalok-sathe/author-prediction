more
facility.
"Well
enough,
if
she
be
good
enough,"
was
the
answer;
"and
so
is
Mr.
Moore
too,
I
dare
say.
To
speak
truth,
I
am
not
anxious
about
him;
some
slight
mischance
would
be
only
his
just
due.
His
conduct
has
been
we
will
say
strange
just
now,
till
we
have
time
to
characterize
it
by
a
more
exact
epithet.
Meantime,
may
I
ask
what
brings
him
here?"
"Mr.
Helstone
and
I
have
just
received
your
message
that
everything
at
Fieldhead
was
at
our
service.
We
judged,
by
the
unlimited
wording
of
the
gracious
intimation,
that
you
would
be
giving
yourself
too
much
trouble.
I
perceive
our
conjecture
was
correct.
We
are
not
a
regiment,
remember
only
about
half
a
dozen
soldiers
and
as
many
civilians.
Allow
me
to
retrench
something
from
these
too
abundant
supplies."
Miss
Keeldar
blushed,
while
she
laughed
at
her
own
over
eager
generosity
and
most
disproportionate
calculations.
Moore
laughed
too,
very
quietly
though;
and
as
quietly
he
ordered
basket
after
basket
to
be
taken
from
the
cart,
and
remanded
vessel
after
vessel
to
the
cellar.
"The
rector
must
hear
of
this,"
he
said;
"he
will
make
a
good
story
of
it.
What
an
excellent
army
contractor
Miss
Keeldar
would
have
been!"
Again
he
laughed,
adding,
"It
is
precisely
as
I
conjectured."
"You
ought
to
be
thankful,"
said
Shirley,
"and
not
mock
me.
What
could
I
do?
How
could
I
gauge
your
appetites
or
number
your
band?
For
aught
I
knew,
there
might
have
been
fifty
of
you
at
least
to
victual.
You
told
me
nothing;
and
then
an
application
to
provision
soldiers
naturally
suggests
large
ideas."
"It
appears
so,"
remarked
Moore,
levelling
another
of
his
keen,
quiet
glances
at
the
discomfited
Shirley.
"Now,"
he
continued,
addressing
the
carter,
"I
think
you
may
take
what
remains
to
the
Hollow.
Your
load
will
be
somewhat
lighter
than
the
one
Miss
Keeldar
destined
you
to
carry."
As
the
vehicle
rumbled
out
of
the
yard,
Shirley,
rallying
her
spirits,
demanded
what
had
become
of
the
wounded.
"There
was
not
a
single
man
hurt
on
our
side,"
was
the
answer.
"You
were
hurt
yourself,
on
the
temples,"
interposed
a
quick,
low
voice
that
of
Caroline,
who,
having
withdrawn
within
the
shade
of
the
door,
and
behind
the
large
person
of
Mrs.
Gill,
had
till
now
escaped
Moore's
notice.
When
she
spoke,
his
eye
searched
the
obscurity
of
her
retreat.
"Are
you
much
hurt?"
she
inquired.
"As
you
might
scratch
your
finger
with
a
needle
in
sewing."
"Lift
your
hair
and
let
us
see."
He
took
his
hat
off,
and
did
as
he
was
bid,
disclosing
only
a
narrow
slip
of
court
plaster.
Caroline
indicated,
by
a
slight
movement
of
the
head,
that
she
was
satisfied,
and
disappeared
within
the
clear
obscure
of
the
interior.
"How
did
she
know
I
was
hurt?"
asked
Moore.
"By
rumour,
no
doubt.
But
it
is
too
good
in
her
to
trouble
herself
about
you.
For
my
part,
it
was
of
your
victims
I
was
