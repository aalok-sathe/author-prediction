find
little
worthy
of
your
sympathies
in
the
ordinary
world.
The
ordinary
world
every
day
honest
folks
are
better
than
you
think
them,
much
better
than
any
bookish,
romancing
chit
of
a
girl
can
be
who
hardly
ever
puts
her
nose
over
her
uncle
the
parson's
garden
wall."
"Consequently
of
whom
you
know
nothing.
Excuse
me
indeed,
it
does
not
matter
whether
you
excuse
me
or
not
you
have
attacked
me
without
provocation;
I
shall
defend
myself
without
apology.
Of
my
relations
with
my
two
cousins
you
are
ignorant.
In
a
fit
of
ill
humour
you
have
attempted
to
poison
them
by
gratuitous
insinuations,
which
are
far
more
crafty
and
false
than
anything
with
which
you
can
justly
charge
me.
That
I
happen
to
be
pale,
and
sometimes
to
look
diffident,
is
no
business
of
yours;
that
I
am
fond
of
books,
and
indisposed
for
common
gossip,
is
still
less
your
business;
that
I
am
a
'romancing
chit
of
a
girl'
is
a
mere
conjecture
on
your
part.
I
never
romanced
to
you
nor
to
anybody
you
know.
That
I
am
the
parson's
niece
is
not
a
crime,
though
you
may
be
narrow
minded
enough
to
think
it
so.
You
dislike
me.
You
have
no
just
reason
for
disliking
me;
therefore
keep
the
expression
of
your
aversion
to
yourself.
If
at
any
time
in
future
you
evince
it
annoyingly,
I
shall
answer
even
less
scrupulously
than
I
have
done
now."
She
ceased,
and
sat
in
white
and
still
excitement.
She
had
spoken
in
the
clearest
of
tones,
neither
fast
nor
loud;
but
her
silver
accents
thrilled
the
ear.
The
speed
of
the
current
in
her
veins
was
just
then
as
swift
as
it
was
viewless.
Mrs.
Yorke
was
not
irritated
at
the
reproof,
worded
with
a
severity
so
simple,
dictated
by
a
pride
so
quiet.
Turning
coolly
to
Miss
Moore,
she
said,
nodding
her
cap
approvingly,
"She
has
spirit
in
her,
after
all.
Always
speak
as
honestly
as
you
have
done
just
now,"
she
continued,
"and
you'll
do."
"I
repel
a
recommendation
so
offensive,"
was
the
answer,
delivered
in
the
same
pure
key,
with
the
same
clear
look.
"I
reject
counsel
poisoned
by
insinuation.
It
is
my
right
to
speak
as
I
think
proper;
nothing
binds
me
to
converse
as
you
dictate.
So
far
from
always
speaking
as
I
have
done
just
now,
I
shall
never
address
any
one
in
a
tone
so
stern
or
in
language
so
harsh,
unless
in
answer
to
unprovoked
insult."
"Mother,
you
have
found
your
match,"
pronounced
little
Jessie,
whom
the
scene
appeared
greatly
to
edify.
Rose
had
heard
the
whole
with
an
unmoved
face.
She
now
said,
"No;
Miss
Helstone
is
not
my
mother's
match,
for
she
allows
herself
to
be
vexed.
My
mother
would
wear
her
out
in
a
few
weeks.
Shirley
Keeldar
manages
better.
Mother,
you
have
never
hurt
Miss
Keeldar's
feelings
yet.
She
wears
armour
under
her
silk
dress
that
you
cannot
penetrate."
Mrs.
Yorke
often
complained
that
her
children
were
