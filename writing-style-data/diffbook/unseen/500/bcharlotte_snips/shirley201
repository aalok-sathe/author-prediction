fearlessly,
then,
on
daisy
and
turf,
and
through
thick
plantations;
she
reached
Fieldhead,
and
penetrated
to
Miss
Keeldar's
dressing
room.
It
was
well
she
had
come,
or
Shirley
would
have
been
too
late.
Instead
of
making
ready
with
all
speed,
she
lay
stretched
on
a
couch,
absorbed
in
reading.
Mrs.
Pryor
stood
near,
vainly
urging
her
to
rise
and
dress.
Caroline
wasted
no
words.
She
immediately
took
the
book
from
her,
and
with
her
own
hands
commenced
the
business
of
disrobing
and
rerobing
her.
Shirley,
indolent
with
the
heat,
and
gay
with
her
youth
and
pleasurable
nature,
wanted
to
talk,
laugh,
and
linger;
but
Caroline,
intent
on
being
in
time,
persevered
in
dressing
her
as
fast
as
fingers
could
fasten
strings
or
insert
pins.
At
length,
as
she
united
a
final
row
of
hooks
and
eyes,
she
found
leisure
to
chide
her,
saying
she
was
very
naughty
to
be
so
unpunctual,
that
she
looked
even
now
the
picture
of
incorrigible
carelessness;
and
so
Shirley
did,
but
a
very
lovely
picture
of
that
tiresome
quality.
She
presented
quite
a
contrast
to
Caroline.
There
was
style
in
every
fold
of
her
dress
and
every
line
of
her
figure.
The
rich
silk
suited
her
better
than
a
simpler
costume;
the
deep
embroidered
scarf
became
her.
She
wore
it
negligently
but
gracefully.
The
wreath
on
her
bonnet
crowned
her
well.
The
attention
to
fashion,
the
tasteful
appliance
of
ornament
in
each
portion
of
her
dress,
were
quite
in
place
with
her.
All
this
suited
her,
like
the
frank
light
in
her
eyes,
the
rallying
smile
about
her
lips,
like
her
shaft
straight
carriage
and
lightsome
step.
Caroline
took
her
hand
when
she
was
dressed,
hurried
her
downstairs,
out
of
doors;
and
thus
they
sped
through
the
fields,
laughing
as
they
went,
and
looking
very
much
like
a
snow
white
dove
and
gem
tinted
bird
of
paradise
joined
in
social
flight.
Thanks
to
Miss
Helstone's
promptitude,
they
arrived
in
good
time.
While
yet
trees
hid
the
church,
they
heard
the
bell
tolling
a
measured
but
urgent
summons
for
all
to
assemble.
The
trooping
in
of
numbers,
the
trampling
of
many
steps
and
murmuring
of
many
voices,
were
likewise
audible.
From
a
rising
ground,
they
presently
saw,
on
the
Whinbury
road,
the
Whinbury
school
approaching.
It
numbered
five
hundred
souls.
The
rector
and
curate,
Boultby
and
Donne,
headed
it
the
former
looming
large
in
full
canonicals,
walking
as
became
a
beneficed
priest,
under
the
canopy
of
a
shovel
hat,
with
the
dignity
of
an
ample
corporation,
the
embellishment
of
the
squarest
and
vastest
of
black
coats,
and
the
support
of
the
stoutest
of
gold
headed
canes.
As
the
doctor
walked,
he
now
and
then
slightly
flourished
his
cane,
and
inclined
his
shovel
hat
with
a
dogmatical
wag
towards
his
aide
de
camp.
That
aide
de
camp
Donne,
to
wit
narrow
as
the
line
of
his
shape
was,
compared
to
the
broad
bulk
of
his
principal,
contrived,
notwithstanding,
to
look
every
inch
a
curate.
