without
envy
or
hatred
of
those
more
happily
circumstanced
than
himself,
thinking
it
no
hardship
and
no
injustice
to
be
forced
to
live
by
labour,
disposed
to
be
honourably
content
if
he
could
but
get
work
to
do
Moore
might
have
made
a
friend.
It
seemed
wonderful
how
he
could
turn
from
such
a
man
without
a
conciliatory
or
a
sympathizing
expression.
The
poor
fellow's
face
looked
haggard
with
want;
he
had
the
aspect
of
a
man
who
had
not
known
what
it
was
to
live
in
comfort
and
plenty
for
weeks,
perhaps
months,
past,
and
yet
there
was
no
ferocity,
no
malignity
in
his
countenance;
it
was
worn,
dejected,
austere,
but
still
patient.
How
could
Moore
leave
him
thus,
with
the
words,
"I'll
never
give
in,"
and
not
a
whisper
of
good
will,
or
hope,
or
aid?
Farren,
as
he
went
home
to
his
cottage
once,
in
better
times,
a
decent,
clean,
pleasant
place,
but
now,
though
still
clean,
very
dreary,
because
so
poor
asked
himself
this
question.
He
concluded
that
the
foreign
mill
owner
was
a
selfish,
an
unfeeling,
and,
he
thought,
too,
a
foolish
man.
It
appeared
to
him
that
emigration,
had
he
only
the
means
to
emigrate,
would
be
preferable
to
service
under
such
a
master.
He
felt
much
cast
down
almost
hopeless.
On
his
entrance
his
wife
served
out,
in
orderly
sort,
such
dinner
as
she
had
to
give
him
and
the
bairns.
It
was
only
porridge,
and
too
little
of
that.
Some
of
the
younger
children
asked
for
more
when
they
had
done
their
portion
an
application
which
disturbed
William
much.
While
his
wife
quieted
them
as
well
as
she
could,
he
left
his
seat
and
went
to
the
door.
He
whistled
a
cheery
stave,
which
did
not,
however,
prevent
a
broad
drop
or
two
(much
more
like
the
"first
of
a
thunder
shower"
than
those
which
oozed
from
the
wound
of
the
gladiator)
from
gathering
on
the
lids
of
his
gray
eyes,
and
plashing
thence
to
the
threshold.
He
cleared
his
vision
with
his
sleeve,
and
the
melting
mood
over,
a
very
stern
one
followed.
He
still
stood
brooding
in
silence,
when
a
gentleman
in
black
came
up
a
clergyman,
it
might
be
seen
at
once,
but
neither
Helstone,
nor
Malone,
nor
Donne,
nor
Sweeting.
He
might
be
forty
years
old;
he
was
plain
looking,
dark
complexioned,
and
already
rather
gray
haired.
He
stooped
a
little
in
walking.
His
countenance,
as
he
came
on,
wore
an
abstracted
and
somewhat
doleful
air;
but
in
approaching
Farren
he
looked
up,
and
then
a
hearty
expression
illuminated
the
preoccupied,
serious
face.
"Is
it
you,
William?
How
are
you?"
he
asked.
"Middling,
Mr.
Hall.
How
are
ye?
Will
ye
step
in
and
rest
ye?"
Mr.
Hall,
whose
name
the
reader
has
seen
mentioned
before
(and
who,
indeed,
was
vicar
of
Nunnely,
of
which
parish
Farren
was
a
native,
and
from
whence
he
had
removed
but
three
years
ago
to
reside
in
Briarfield,
for
the
convenience
of
being
