history
not
from
herself,
but
from
others.
With
every
detail
of
Mr.
James
Helstone's
career
and
character
I
was
acquainted.
An
afternoon's
sitting
and
conversation
with
Miss
Mann
had
rendered
me
familiar
therewith;
also
he
is
one
of
Mrs.
Yorke's
warning
examples
one
of
the
blood
red
lights
she
hangs
out
to
scare
young
ladies
from
matrimony.
I
believe
I
should
have
been
sceptical
about
the
truth
of
the
portrait
traced
by
such
fingers
both
these
ladies
take
a
dark
pleasure
in
offering
to
view
the
dark
side
of
life
but
I
questioned
Mr.
Yorke
on
the
subject,
and
he
said,
'Shirley,
my
woman,
if
you
want
to
know
aught
about
yond'
James
Helstone,
I
can
only
say
he
was
a
man
tiger.
He
was
handsome,
dissolute,
soft,
treacherous,
courteous,
cruel
'
Don't
cry,
Cary;
we'll
say
no
more
about
it."
"I
am
not
crying,
Shirley;
or
if
I
am,
it
is
nothing.
Go
on;
you
are
no
friend
if
you
withhold
from
me
the
truth.
I
hate
that
false
plan
of
disguising,
mutilating
the
truth."
"Fortunately
I
have
said
pretty
nearly
all
that
I
have
to
say,
except
that
your
uncle
himself
confirmed
Mr.
Yorke's
words;
for
he
too
scorns
a
lie,
and
deals
in
none
of
those
conventional
subterfuges
that
are
shabbier
than
lies."
"But
papa
is
dead;
they
should
let
him
alone
now."
"They
should;
and
we
will
let
him
alone.
Cry
away,
Cary;
it
will
do
you
good.
It
is
wrong
to
check
natural
tears.
Besides,
I
choose
to
please
myself
by
sharing
an
idea
that
at
this
moment
beams
in
your
mother's
eye
while
she
looks
at
you.
Every
drop
blots
out
a
sin.
Weep!
your
tears
have
the
virtue
which
the
rivers
of
Damascus
lacked.
Like
Jordan,
they
can
cleanse
a
leprous
memory."
"Madam,"
she
continued,
addressing
Mrs.
Pryor,
"did
you
think
I
could
be
daily
in
the
habit
of
seeing
you
and
your
daughter
together
marking
your
marvellous
similarity
in
many
points,
observing
(pardon
me)
your
irrepressible
emotions
in
the
presence
and
still
more
in
the
absence
of
your
child
and
not
form
my
own
conjectures?
I
formed
them,
and
they
are
literally
correct.
I
shall
begin
to
think
myself
shrewd."
"And
you
said
nothing?"
observed
Caroline,
who
soon
regained
the
quiet
control
of
her
feelings.
"Nothing.
I
had
no
warrant
to
breathe
a
word
on
the
subject.
My
business
it
was
not;
I
abstained
from
making
it
such."
"You
guessed
so
deep
a
secret,
and
did
not
hint
that
you
guessed
it?"
"Is
that
so
difficult?"
"It
is
not
like
you."
"How
do
you
know?"
"You
are
not
reserved;
you
are
frankly
communicative."
"I
may
be
communicative,
yet
know
where
to
stop.
In
showing
my
treasure
I
may
withhold
a
gem
or
two
a
curious,
unbought
graven
stone
an
amulet
of
whose
mystic
glitter
I
rarely
permit
even
myself
a
glimpse.
Good
day."
Caroline
thus
seemed
to
get
a
view
of
Shirley's
character
under
a
novel
aspect.
Ere
long
the
prospect
was
