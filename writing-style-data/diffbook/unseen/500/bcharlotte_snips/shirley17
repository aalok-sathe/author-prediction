him
well,
for
an
anxious
countenance
and
a
hollow,
somewhat
haggard,
outline
of
face
disturb
the
idea
of
beauty
with
one
of
care.
His
eyes
are
large,
and
grave,
and
gray;
their
expression
is
intent
and
meditative,
rather
searching
than
soft,
rather
thoughtful
than
genial.
When
he
parts
his
lips
in
a
smile,
his
physiognomy
is
agreeable
not
that
it
is
frank
or
cheerful
even
then,
but
you
feel
the
influence
of
a
certain
sedate
charm,
suggestive,
whether
truly
or
delusively,
of
a
considerate,
perhaps
a
kind
nature,
of
feelings
that
may
wear
well
at
home
patient,
forbearing,
possibly
faithful
feelings.
He
is
still
young
not
more
than
thirty;
his
stature
is
tall,
his
figure
slender.
His
manner
of
speaking
displeases.
He
has
an
outlandish
accent,
which,
notwithstanding
a
studied
carelessness
of
pronunciation
and
diction,
grates
on
a
British,
and
especially
on
a
Yorkshire,
ear.
Mr.
Moore,
indeed,
was
but
half
a
Briton,
and
scarcely
that.
He
came
of
a
foreign
ancestry
by
the
mother's
side,
and
was
himself
born
and
partly
reared
on
a
foreign
soil.
A
hybrid
in
nature,
it
is
probable
he
had
a
hybrid's
feeling
on
many
points
patriotism
for
one;
it
is
likely
that
he
was
unapt
to
attach
himself
to
parties,
to
sects,
even
to
climes
and
customs;
it
is
not
impossible
that
he
had
a
tendency
to
isolate
his
individual
person
from
any
community
amidst
which
his
lot
might
temporarily
happen
to
be
thrown,
and
that
he
felt
it
to
be
his
best
wisdom
to
push
the
interests
of
Robert
Gerard
Moore,
to
the
exclusion
of
philanthropic
consideration
for
general
interests,
with
which
he
regarded
the
said
Gerard
Moore
as
in
a
great
measure
disconnected.
Trade
was
Mr.
Moore's
hereditary
calling:
the
Gerards
of
Antwerp
had
been
merchants
for
two
centuries
back.
Once
they
had
been
wealthy
merchants;
but
the
uncertainties,
the
involvements,
of
business
had
come
upon
them;
disastrous
speculations
had
loosened
by
degrees
the
foundations
of
their
credit.
The
house
had
stood
on
a
tottering
base
for
a
dozen
years;
and
at
last,
in
the
shock
of
the
French
Revolution,
it
had
rushed
down
a
total
ruin.
In
its
fall
was
involved
the
English
and
Yorkshire
firm
of
Moore,
closely
connected
with
the
Antwerp
house,
and
of
which
one
of
the
partners,
resident
in
Antwerp,
Robert
Moore,
had
married
Hortense
Gerard,
with
the
prospect
of
his
bride
inheriting
her
father
Constantine
Gerard's
share
in
the
business.
She
inherited,
as
we
have
seen,
but
his
share
in
the
liabilities
of
the
firm;
and
these
liabilities,
though
duly
set
aside
by
a
composition
with
creditors,
some
said
her
son
Robert
accepted,
in
his
turn,
as
a
legacy,
and
that
he
aspired
one
day
to
discharge
them,
and
to
rebuild
the
fallen
house
of
Gerard
and
Moore
on
a
scale
at
least
equal
to
its
former
greatness.
It
was
even
supposed
that
he
took
by
past
circumstances
much
to
heart;
and
if
a
childhood
passed
at
the
side
of
a
saturnine
mother,
under
foreboding
