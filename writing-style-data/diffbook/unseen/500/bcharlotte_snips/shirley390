in
the
opposite
direction."
"Put
your
arm
through
mine;
I'll
take
care
of
you."
"But
the
wall
the
hedge
it
is
such
hard
work
climbing,
and
you
are
too
slender
and
young
to
help
me
without
hurting
yourself."
"You
shall
go
through
the
gate."
"But
"
"But,
but
will
you
trust
me
or
not?"
She
looked
into
his
face.
"I
think
I
will.
Anything
rather
than
return
as
anxious
as
I
came."
"I
can't
answer
for
that.
This,
however,
I
promise
you:
be
ruled
by
me,
and
you
shall
see
Moore
yourself."
"See
him
myself?"
"Yourself."
"But,
dear
Martin,
does
he
know?"
"Ah!
I'm
dear
now.
No,
he
doesn't
know."
"And
your
mother
and
the
others?"
"All
is
right."
Caroline
fell
into
a
long,
silent
fit
of
musing,
but
still
she
walked
on
with
her
guide.
They
came
in
sight
of
Briarmains.
"Have
you
made
up
your
mind?"
he
asked.
She
was
silent.
"Decide;
we
are
just
on
the
spot.
I
won't
see
him
that
I
tell
you
except
to
announce
your
arrival."
"Martin,
you
are
a
strange
boy,
and
this
is
a
strange
step;
but
all
I
feel
is
and
has
been,
for
a
long
time,
strange.
I
will
see
him."
"Having
said
that,
you
will
neither
hesitate
nor
retract?"
"No."
"Here
we
are,
then.
Do
not
be
afraid
of
passing
the
parlour
window;
no
one
will
see
you.
My
father
and
Matthew
are
at
the
mill,
Mark
is
at
school,
the
servants
are
in
the
back
kitchen,
Miss
Moore
is
at
the
cottage,
my
mother
in
her
bed,
and
Mrs.
Horsfall
in
paradise.
Observe
I
need
not
ring.
I
open
the
door;
the
hall
is
empty,
the
staircase
quiet;
so
is
the
gallery.
The
whole
house
and
all
its
inhabitants
are
under
a
spell,
which
I
will
not
break
till
you
are
gone."
"Martin,
I
trust
you."
"You
never
said
a
better
word.
Let
me
take
your
shawl.
I
will
shake
off
the
snow
and
dry
it
for
you.
You
are
cold
and
wet.
Never
mind;
there
is
a
fire
upstairs.
Are
you
ready?"
"Yes."
"Follow
me."
He
left
his
shoes
on
the
mat,
mounted
the
stair
unshod.
Caroline
stole
after,
with
noiseless
step.
There
was
a
gallery,
and
there
was
a
passage;
at
the
end
of
that
passage
Martin
paused
before
a
door
and
tapped.
He
had
to
tap
twice
thrice.
A
voice,
known
to
one
listener,
at
last
said,
"Come
in."
The
boy
entered
briskly.
"Mr.
Moore,
a
lady
called
to
inquire
after
you.
None
of
the
women
were
about.
It
is
washing
day,
and
the
maids
are
over
the
crown
of
the
head
in
soap
suds
in
the
back
kitchen,
so
I
asked
her
to
step
up."
"Up
here,
sir?"
"Up
here,
sir;
but
if
you
object,
she
shall
go
down
again."
"Is
this
a
place
or
am
I
a
person
to
bring
a
lady
to,
you
absurd
lad?"
"No;
so
I'll
take
her
off."
"Martin,
you
will
stay
here.
Who
is
she?"
"Your
grandmother
