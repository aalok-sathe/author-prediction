appalled.
She
had
passed
alone
through
protracted
scenes
of
suffering,
exercised
rigid
self
denial,
made
large
sacrifices
of
time,
money,
health
for
those
who
had
repaid
her
only
by
ingratitude,
and
now
her
main
almost
her
sole
fault
was
that
she
was
censorious.
Censorious
she
certainly
was.
Caroline
had
not
sat
five
minutes
ere
her
hostess,
still
keeping
her
under
the
spell
of
that
dread
and
Gorgon
gaze,
began
flaying
alive
certain
of
the
families
in
the
neighbourhood.
She
went
to
work
at
this
business
in
a
singularly
cool,
deliberate
manner,
like
some
surgeon
practising
with
his
scalpel
on
a
lifeless
subject.
She
made
few
distinctions;
she
allowed
scarcely
any
one
to
be
good;
she
dissected
impartially
almost
all
her
acquaintance.
If
her
auditress
ventured
now
and
then
to
put
in
a
palliative
word
she
set
it
aside
with
a
certain
disdain.
Still,
though
thus
pitiless
in
moral
anatomy,
she
was
no
scandal
monger.
She
never
disseminated
really
malignant
or
dangerous
reports.
It
was
not
her
heart
so
much
as
her
temper
that
was
wrong.
Caroline
made
this
discovery
for
the
first
time
to
day,
and
moved
thereby
to
regret
divers
unjust
judgments
she
had
more
than
once
passed
on
the
crabbed
old
maid,
she
began
to
talk
to
her
softly,
not
in
sympathizing
words,
but
with
a
sympathizing
voice.
The
loneliness
of
her
condition
struck
her
visitor
in
a
new
light,
as
did
also
the
character
of
her
ugliness
a
bloodless
pallor
of
complexion,
and
deeply
worn
lines
of
feature.
The
girl
pitied
the
solitary
and
afflicted
woman;
her
looks
told
what
she
felt.
A
sweet
countenance
is
never
so
sweet
as
when
the
moved
heart
animates
it
with
compassionate
tenderness.
Miss
Mann,
seeing
such
a
countenance
raised
to
her,
was
touched
in
her
turn.
She
acknowledged
her
sense
of
the
interest
thus
unexpectedly
shown
in
her,
who
usually
met
with
only
coldness
and
ridicule,
by
replying
to
her
candidly.
Communicative
on
her
own
affairs
she
usually
was
not,
because
no
one
cared
to
listen
to
her;
but
to
day
she
became
so,
and
her
confidante
shed
tears
as
she
heard
her
speak,
for
she
told
of
cruel,
slow
wasting,
obstinate
sufferings.
Well
might
she
be
corpse
like;
well
might
she
look
grim,
and
never
smile;
well
might
she
wish
to
avoid
excitement,
to
gain
and
retain
composure!
Caroline,
when
she
knew
all,
acknowledged
that
Miss
Mann
was
rather
to
be
admired
for
fortitude
than
blamed
for
moroseness.
Reader!
when
you
behold
an
aspect
for
whose
constant
gloom
and
frown
you
cannot
account,
whose
unvarying
cloud
exasperates
you
by
its
apparent
causelessness,
be
sure
that
there
is
a
canker
somewhere,
and
a
canker
not
the
less
deeply
corroding
because
concealed.
Miss
Mann
felt
that
she
was
understood
partly,
and
wished
to
be
understood
further;
for,
however
old,
plain,
humble,
desolate,
afflicted
we
may
be,
so
long
as
our
hearts
preserve
the
feeblest
spark
of
life,
they
preserve
also,
shivering
near
that
pale
ember,
a
starved,
ghostly
longing
for
appreciation
