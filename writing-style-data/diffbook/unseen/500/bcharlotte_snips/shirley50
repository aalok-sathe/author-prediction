good
time.
We
will
have
a
little
reading
in
the
evening.
The
moon
rises
at
half
past
eight,
and
I
will
walk
up
to
the
rectory
with
you
at
nine.
Do
you
agree?"
She
nodded
her
head,
and
her
eyes
lit
up.
Moore
lingered
yet
two
minutes.
He
bent
over
Caroline's
desk
and
glanced
at
her
grammar,
he
fingered
her
pen,
he
lifted
her
bouquet
and
played
with
it;
his
horse
stamped
impatient;
Fred
Murgatroyd
hemmed
and
coughed
at
the
gate,
as
if
he
wondered
what
in
the
world
his
master
was
doing.
"Good
morning,"
again
said
Moore,
and
finally
vanished.
Hortense,
coming
in
ten
minutes
after,
found,
to
her
surprise,
that
Caroline
had
not
yet
commenced
her
exercise.
Mademoiselle
Moore
had
that
morning
a
somewhat
absent
minded
pupil.
Caroline
forgot,
again
and
again,
the
explanations
which
were
given
to
her.
However,
she
still
bore
with
unclouded
mood
the
chidings
her
inattention
brought
upon
her.
Sitting
in
the
sunshine
near
the
window,
she
seemed
to
receive
with
its
warmth
a
kind
influence,
which
made
her
both
happy
and
good.
Thus
disposed,
she
looked
her
best,
and
her
best
was
a
pleasing
vision.
To
her
had
not
been
denied
the
gift
of
beauty.
It
was
not
absolutely
necessary
to
know
her
in
order
to
like
her;
she
was
fair
enough
to
please,
even
at
the
first
view.
Her
shape
suited
her
age:
it
was
girlish,
light,
and
pliant;
every
curve
was
neat,
every
limb
proportionate;
her
face
was
expressive
and
gentle;
her
eyes
were
handsome,
and
gifted
at
times
with
a
winning
beam
that
stole
into
the
heart,
with
a
language
that
spoke
softly
to
the
affections.
Her
mouth
was
very
pretty;
she
had
a
delicate
skin,
and
a
fine
flow
of
brown
hair,
which
she
knew
how
to
arrange
with
taste;
curls
became
her,
and
she
possessed
them
in
picturesque
profusion.
Her
style
of
dress
announced
taste
in
the
wearer
very
unobtrusive
in
fashion,
far
from
costly
in
material,
but
suitable
in
colour
to
the
fair
complexion
with
which
it
contrasted,
and
in
make
to
the
slight
form
which
it
draped.
Her
present
winter
garb
was
of
merino
the
same
soft
shade
of
brown
as
her
hair;
the
little
collar
round
her
neck
lay
over
a
pink
ribbon,
and
was
fastened
with
a
pink
knot.
She
wore
no
other
decoration.
So
much
for
Caroline
Helstone's
appearance.
As
to
her
character
or
intellect,
if
she
had
any,
they
must
speak
for
themselves
in
due
time.
Her
connections
are
soon
explained.
She
was
the
child
of
parents
separated
soon
after
her
birth,
in
consequence
of
disagreement
of
disposition.
Her
mother
was
the
half
sister
of
Mr.
Moore's
father;
thus,
though
there
was
no
mixture
of
blood,
she
was,
in
a
distant
sense,
the
cousin
of
Robert,
Louis,
and
Hortense.
Her
father
was
the
brother
of
Mr.
Helstone
a
man
of
the
character
friends
desire
not
to
recall,
after
death
has
once
settled
all
earthly
accounts.
He
had
rendered
his
wife
unhappy.
