from
the
gaunt
mill
chimney.
A
dark
blue
apparition
(that
of
Joe
Scott,
fresh
from
a
dyeing
vat)
appeared
momentarily
at
the
open
door,
uttered
the
words
"He's
comed,
sir,"
and
vanished.
Mr.
Moore
raised
not
his
eyes
from
the
paper.
A
large
man,
broad
shouldered
and
massive
limbed,
clad
in
fustian
garments
and
gray
worsted
stockings,
entered,
who
was
received
with
a
nod,
and
desired
to
take
a
seat,
which
he
did,
making
the
remark,
as
he
removed
his
hat
(a
very
bad
one),
stowed
it
away
under
his
chair,
and
wiped
his
forehead
with
a
spotted
cotton
handkerchief
extracted
from
the
hat
crown,
that
it
was
"raight
dahn
warm
for
Febewerry."
Mr.
Moore
assented
at
least
he
uttered
some
slight
sound,
which,
though
inarticulate,
might
pass
for
an
assent.
The
visitor
now
carefully
deposited
in
the
corner
beside
him
an
official
looking
staff
which
he
bore
in
his
hand;
this
done,
he
whistled,
probably
by
way
of
appearing
at
his
ease.
"You
have
what
is
necessary,
I
suppose?"
said
Mr.
Moore.
"Ay,
ay!
all's
right."
He
renewed
his
whistling,
Mr.
Moore
his
reading.
The
paper
apparently
had
become
more
interesting.
Presently,
however,
he
turned
to
his
cupboard,
which
was
within
reach
of
his
long
arm,
opened
it
without
rising,
took
out
a
black
bottle
the
same
he
had
produced
for
Malone's
benefit
a
tumbler,
and
a
jug,
placed
them
on
the
table,
and
said
to
his
guest,
"Help
yourself;
there's
water
in
that
jar
in
the
corner."
"I
dunnut
knaw
that
there's
mich
need,
for
all
a
body
is
dry
(thirsty)
in
a
morning,"
said
the
fustian
gentleman,
rising
and
doing
as
requested.
"Will
you
tak
naught
yourseln,
Mr.
Moore?"
he
inquired,
as
with
skilled
hand
he
mixed
a
portion,
and
having
tested
it
by
a
deep
draught,
sank
back
satisfied
and
bland
in
his
seat.
Moore,
chary
of
words,
replied
by
a
negative
movement
and
murmur.
"Yah'd
as
good,"
continued
his
visitor;
"it
'uld
set
ye
up
wald
a
sup
o'
this
stuff.
Uncommon
good
hollands.
Ye
get
it
fro'
furrin
parts,
I'se
think?"
"Ay!"
"Tak
my
advice
and
try
a
glass
on't.
Them
lads
'at's
coming
'll
keep
ye
talking,
nob'dy
knows
how
long.
Ye'll
need
propping."
"Have
you
seen
Mr.
Sykes
this
morning?"
inquired
Moore.
"I
seed
him
a
hauf
an
hour
nay,
happen
a
quarter
of
an
hour
sin',
just
afore
I
set
off.
He
said
he
aimed
to
come
here,
and
I
sudn't
wonder
but
ye'll
have
old
Helstone
too.
I
seed
'em
saddling
his
little
nag
as
I
passed
at
back
o'
t'
rectory."
The
speaker
was
a
true
prophet,
for
the
trot
of
a
little
nag's
hoofs
was,
five
minutes
after,
heard
in
the
yard.
It
stopped,
and
a
well
known
nasal
voice
cried
aloud,
"Boy"
(probably
addressing
Harry
Scott,
who
usually
hung
about
the
premises
from
9
a.m.
to
5
p.m.),
"take
my
horse
and
lead
him
into
the
stable."
Helstone
came
in
marching
nimbly
and
erect,
looking
browner,
keener,
