and
girls,
would
be
better
at
home;
and
her
decision
that,
instead
of
going
to
church,
they
should
sit
silent
for
two
hours
in
the
back
parlour,
while
Rose
and
Martin
alternately
read
a
succession
of
sermons
John
Wesley's
"Sermons."
John
Wesley,
being
a
reformer
and
an
agitator,
had
a
place
both
in
her
own
and
her
husband's
favour.
"Rose
will
do
as
she
pleases,"
said
Martin,
not
looking
up
from
the
book
which,
according
to
his
custom
then
and
in
after
life,
he
was
studying
over
his
bread
and
milk.
"Rose
will
do
as
she
is
told,
and
Martin
too,"
observed
the
mother.
"I
am
going
to
church."
So
her
son
replied,
with
the
ineffable
quietude
of
a
true
Yorke,
who
knows
his
will
and
means
to
have
it,
and
who,
if
pushed
to
the
wall,
will
let
himself
be
crushed
to
death,
provided
no
way
of
escape
can
be
found,
but
will
never
capitulate.
"It
is
not
fit
weather,"
said
the
father.
No
answer.
The
youth
read
studiously;
he
slowly
broke
his
bread
and
sipped
his
milk.
"Martin
hates
to
go
to
church,
but
he
hates
still
more
to
obey,"
said
Mrs.
Yorke.
"I
suppose
I
am
influenced
by
pure
perverseness?"
"Yes,
you
are."
"Mother,
I
am
not."
"By
what,
then,
are
you
influenced?"
"By
a
complication
of
motives,
the
intricacies
of
which
I
should
as
soon
think
of
explaining
to
you
as
I
should
of
turning
myself
inside
out
to
exhibit
the
internal
machinery
of
my
frame."
"Hear
Martin!
hear
him!"
cried
Mr.
Yorke.
"I
must
see
and
have
this
lad
of
mine
brought
up
to
the
bar.
Nature
meant
him
to
live
by
his
tongue.
Hesther,
your
third
son
must
certainly
be
a
lawyer;
he
has
the
stock
in
trade
brass,
self
conceit,
and
words
words
words."
"Some
bread,
Rose,
if
you
please,"
requested
Martin,
with
intense
gravity,
serenity,
phlegm.
The
boy
had
naturally
a
low,
plaintive
voice,
which
in
his
"dour
moods"
rose
scarcely
above
a
lady's
whisper.
The
more
inflexibly
stubborn
the
humour,
the
softer,
the
sadder
the
tone.
He
rang
the
bell,
and
gently
asked
for
his
walking
shoes.
"But,
Martin,"
urged
his
sire,
"there
is
drift
all
the
way;
a
man
could
hardly
wade
through
it.
However,
lad,"
he
continued,
seeing
that
the
boy
rose
as
the
church
bell
began
to
toll,
"this
is
a
case
wherein
I
would
by
no
means
balk
the
obdurate
chap
of
his
will.
Go
to
church
by
all
means.
There
is
a
pitiless
wind,
and
a
sharp,
frozen
sleet,
besides
the
depth
under
foot.
Go
out
into
it,
since
thou
prefers
it
to
a
warm
fireside."
Martin
quietly
assumed
his
cloak,
comforter,
and
cap,
and
deliberately
went
out.
"My
father
has
more
sense
than
my
mother,"
he
pronounced.
"How
women
miss
it!
They
drive
the
nail
into
the
flesh,
thinking
they
are
hammering
away
at
insensate
stone."
He
reached
church
early.
"Now,
if
the
weather
frightens
her
(and
it
is
a
real
December
tempest),
or
if
