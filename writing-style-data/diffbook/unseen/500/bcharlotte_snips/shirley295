Europe
be
locked
into
the
bays
of
Australia
ere
I
forget."
"Hush,
mother!
Rest!
Be
at
peace!"
And
the
child
lulled
the
parent,
as
the
parent
had
erst
lulled
the
child.
At
last
Mrs.
Pryor
wept.
She
then
grew
calmer.
She
resumed
those
tender
cares
agitation
had
for
a
moment
suspended.
Replacing
her
daughter
on
the
couch,
she
smoothed
the
pillow
and
spread
the
sheet.
The
soft
hair
whose
locks
were
loosened
she
rearranged,
the
damp
brow
she
refreshed
with
a
cool,
fragrant
essence.
"Mamma,
let
them
bring
a
candle,
that
I
may
see
you;
and
tell
my
uncle
to
come
into
this
room
by
and
by.
I
want
to
hear
him
say
that
I
am
your
daughter.
And,
mamma,
take
your
supper
here.
Don't
leave
me
for
one
minute
to
night."
"O
Caroline,
it
is
well
you
are
gentle!
You
will
say
to
me,
Go,
and
I
shall
go;
Come,
and
I
shall
come;
Do
this,
and
I
shall
do
it.
You
inherit
a
certain
manner
as
well
as
certain
features.
It
will
always
be
'mamma'
prefacing
a
mandate
softly
spoken,
though,
from
you,
thank
God!
Well,"
she
added,
under
her
breath,
"he
spoke
softly
too,
once,
like
a
flute
breathing
tenderness;
and
then,
when
the
world
was
not
by
to
listen,
discords
that
split
the
nerves
and
curdled
the
blood
sounds
to
inspire
insanity."
"It
seems
so
natural,
mamma,
to
ask
you
for
this
and
that.
I
shall
want
nobody
but
you
to
be
near
me,
or
to
do
anything
for
me.
But
do
not
let
me
be
troublesome.
Check
me
if
I
encroach."
"You
must
not
depend
on
me
to
check
you;
you
must
keep
guard
over
yourself.
I
have
little
moral
courage;
the
want
of
it
is
my
bane.
It
is
that
which
has
made
me
an
unnatural
parent
which
has
kept
me
apart
from
my
child
during
the
ten
years
which
have
elapsed
since
my
husband's
death
left
me
at
liberty
to
claim
her.
It
was
that
which
first
unnerved
my
arms
and
permitted
the
infant
I
might
have
retained
a
while
longer
to
be
snatched
prematurely
from
their
embrace."
"How,
mamma?"
"I
let
you
go
as
a
babe,
because
you
were
pretty,
and
I
feared
your
loveliness,
deeming
it
the
stamp
of
perversity.
They
sent
me
your
portrait,
taken
at
eight
years
old;
that
portrait
confirmed
my
fears.
Had
it
shown
me
a
sunburnt
little
rustic
a
heavy,
blunt
featured,
commonplace
child
I
should
have
hastened
to
claim
you;
but
there,
under
the
silver
paper,
I
saw
blooming
the
delicacy
of
an
aristocratic
flower
'little
lady'
was
written
on
every
trait.
I
had
too
recently
crawled
from
under
the
yoke
of
the
fine
gentleman
escaped
galled,
crushed,
paralyzed,
dying
to
dare
to
encounter
his
still
finer
and
most
fairy
like
representative.
My
sweet
little
lady
overwhelmed
me
with
dismay;
her
air
of
native
elegance
froze
my
very
marrow.
In
my
experience
I
had
not
met
with
truth,
modesty,
good
principle
as
the
concomitants
of
