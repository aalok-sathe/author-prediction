intense
heat
of
their
clear
glow;
near
the
rug
is
a
little
work
table,
a
desk
upon
it,
a
chair
near
it.
Does
the
vision
Moore
has
tracked
occupy
that
chair?
You
would
think
so,
could
you
see
him
standing
before
it.
There
is
as
much
interest
now
in
his
eye,
and
as
much
significance
in
his
face,
as
if
in
this
household
solitude
he
had
found
a
living
companion,
and
was
going
to
speak
to
it.
He
makes
discoveries.
A
bag
a
small
satin
bag
hangs
on
the
chair
back.
The
desk
is
open,
the
keys
are
in
the
lock.
A
pretty
seal,
a
silver
pen,
a
crimson
berry
or
two
of
ripe
fruit
on
a
green
leaf,
a
small,
clean,
delicate
glove
these
trifles
at
once
decorate
and
disarrange
the
stand
they
strew.
Order
forbids
details
in
a
picture
she
puts
them
tidily
away;
but
details
give
charm.
Moore
spoke.
"Her
mark,"
he
said.
"Here
she
has
been
careless,
attractive
thing!
called
away
in
haste,
doubtless,
and
forgetting
to
return
and
put
all
to
rights.
Why
does
she
leave
fascination
in
her
footprints?
Whence
did
she
acquire
the
gift
to
be
heedless
and
never
offend?
There
is
always
something
to
chide
in
her,
and
the
reprimand
never
settles
in
displeasure
on
the
heart,
but,
for
her
lover
or
her
husband,
when
it
had
trickled
a
while
in
words,
would
naturally
melt
from
his
lips
in
a
kiss.
Better
pass
half
an
hour
in
remonstrating
with
her
than
a
day
in
admiring
or
praising
any
other
woman
alive.
Am
I
muttering?
soliloquizing?
Stop
that."
He
did
stop
it.
He
stood
thinking,
and
then
he
made
an
arrangement
for
his
evening's
comfort.
He
dropped
the
curtains
over
the
broad
window
and
regal
moon.
He
shut
out
sovereign
and
court
and
starry
armies;
he
added
fuel
to
the
hot
but
fast
wasting
fire;
he
lit
a
candle,
of
which
there
were
a
pair
on
the
table;
he
placed
another
chair
opposite
that
near
the
workstand;
and
then
he
sat
down.
His
next
movement
was
to
take
from
his
pocket
a
small,
thick
book
of
blank
paper,
to
produce
a
pencil,
and
to
begin
to
write
in
a
cramp,
compact
hand.
Come
near,
by
all
means,
reader.
Do
not
be
shy.
Stoop
over
his
shoulder
fearlessly,
and
read
as
he
scribbles.
"It
is
nine
o'clock;
the
carriage
will
not
return
before
eleven,
I
am
certain.
Freedom
is
mine
till
then;
till
then
I
may
occupy
her
room,
sit
opposite
her
chair,
rest
my
elbow
on
her
table,
have
her
little
mementoes
about
me.
"I
used
rather
to
like
Solitude
to
fancy
her
a
somewhat
quiet
and
serious,
yet
fair
nymph;
an
Oread,
descending
to
me
from
lone
mountain
passes,
something
of
the
blue
mist
of
hills
in
her
array
and
of
their
chill
breeze
in
her
breath,
but
much
also
of
their
solemn
beauty
in
her
mien.
I
once
could
court
her
serenely,
and
imagine
my
heart
easier
when
I
held
her
