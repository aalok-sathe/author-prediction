the
three,
owns
another
nature.
Life
may,
or
may
not,
be
brief
for
him,
but
it
will
certainly
be
brilliant.
He
will
pass
through
all
its
illusions,
half
believe
in
them,
wholly
enjoy
them,
then
outlive
them.
That
boy
is
not
handsome
not
so
handsome
as
either
of
his
brothers.
He
is
plain;
there
is
a
husk
upon
him,
a
dry
shell,
and
he
will
wear
it
till
he
is
near
twenty,
then
he
will
put
it
off.
About
that
period
he
will
make
himself
handsome.
He
will
wear
uncouth
manners
till
that
age,
perhaps
homely
garments;
but
the
chrysalis
will
retain
the
power
of
transfiguring
itself
into
the
butterfly,
and
such
transfiguration
will,
in
due
season,
take
place.
For
a
space
he
will
be
vain,
probably
a
downright
puppy,
eager
for
pleasure
and
desirous
of
admiration,
athirst,
too,
for
knowledge.
He
will
want
all
that
the
world
can
give
him,
both
of
enjoyment
and
lore;
he
will,
perhaps,
take
deep
draughts
at
each
fount.
That
thirst
satisfied,
what
next?
I
know
not.
Martin
might
be
a
remarkable
man.
Whether
he
will
or
not,
the
seer
is
powerless
to
predict:
on
that
subject
there
has
been
no
open
vision.
Take
Mr.
Yorke's
family
in
the
aggregate:
there
is
as
much
mental
power
in
those
six
young
heads,
as
much
originality,
as
much
activity
and
vigour
of
brain,
as
divided
amongst
half
a
dozen
commonplace
broods
would
give
to
each
rather
more
than
an
average
amount
of
sense
and
capacity.
Mr.
Yorke
knows
this,
and
is
proud
of
his
race.
Yorkshire
has
such
families
here
and
there
amongst
her
hills
and
wolds
peculiar,
racy,
vigorous;
of
good
blood
and
strong
brain;
turbulent
somewhat
in
the
pride
of
their
strength,
and
intractable
in
the
force
of
their
native
powers;
wanting
polish,
wanting
consideration,
wanting
docility,
but
sound,
spirited,
and
true
bred
as
the
eagle
on
the
cliff
or
the
steed
in
the
steppe.
A
low
tap
is
heard
at
the
parlour
door;
the
boys
have
been
making
such
a
noise
over
their
game,
and
little
Jessy,
besides,
has
been
singing
so
sweet
a
Scotch
song
to
her
father
who
delights
in
Scotch
and
Italian
songs,
and
has
taught
his
musical
little
daughter
some
of
the
best
that
the
ring
at
the
outer
door
was
not
observed.
"Come
in,"
says
Mrs.
Yorke,
in
that
conscientiously
constrained
and
solemnized
voice
of
hers,
which
ever
modulates
itself
to
a
funereal
dreariness
of
tone,
though
the
subject
it
is
exercised
upon
be
but
to
give
orders
for
the
making
of
a
pudding
in
the
kitchen,
to
bid
the
boys
hang
up
their
caps
in
the
hall,
or
to
call
the
girls
to
their
sewing
"come
in!"
And
in
came
Robert
Moore.
Moore's
habitual
gravity,
as
well
as
his
abstemiousness
(for
the
case
of
spirit
decanters
is
never
ordered
up
when
he
pays
an
evening
visit),
has
so
far
recommended
him
to
Mrs.
Yorke
that
she
has
not
yet
made
him
the
subject
of
private
animadversions
with
