Mr.
Moore?
Indeed
and
truly
I
have
lost
them
again;
and
Mrs.
Gill
wants
some
money,
and
I
have
none,
except
this
sixpence.'
"She
took
the
coin
out
of
her
apron
pocket,
and
showed
it
in
her
palm.
I
could
have
trifled
with
her,
but
it
would
not
do;
life
and
death
were
at
stake.
Mastering
at
once
the
sixpence
and
the
hand
that
held
it,
I
demanded,
'Am
I
to
die
without
you,
or
am
I
to
live
for
you?'
"'Do
as
you
please.
Far
be
it
from
me
to
dictate
your
choice.'
"'You
shall
tell
me
with
your
own
lips
whether
you
doom
me
to
exile
or
call
me
to
hope.'
"'Go;
I
can
bear
to
be
left.'
"'Perhaps
I
too
can
bear
to
leave
you.
But
reply,
Shirley,
my
pupil,
my
sovereign
reply.'
"'Die
without
me
if
you
will;
live
for
me
if
you
dare.'
"'I
am
not
afraid
of
you,
my
leopardess.
I
dare
live
for
and
with
you,
from
this
hour
till
my
death.
Now,
then,
I
have
you.
You
are
mine.
I
will
never
let
you
go.
Wherever
my
home
be,
I
have
chosen
my
wife.
If
I
stay
in
England,
in
England
you
will
stay;
if
I
cross
the
Atlantic,
you
will
cross
it
also.
Our
lives
are
riveted,
our
lots
intertwined.'
"'And
are
we
equal,
then,
sir?
are
we
equal
at
last?'
"'You
are
younger,
frailer,
feebler,
more
ignorant
than
I.'
"'Will
you
be
good
to
me,
and
never
tyrannize?'
"'Will
you
let
me
breathe,
and
not
bewilder
me?
You
must
not
smile
at
present.
The
world
swims
and
changes
round
me.
The
sun
is
a
dizzying
scarlet
blaze,
the
sky
a
violet
vortex
whirling
over
me.'
"I
am
a
strong
man,
but
I
staggered
as
I
spoke.
All
creation
was
exaggerated.
Colour
grew
more
vivid,
motion
more
rapid,
life
itself
more
vital.
I
hardly
saw
her
for
a
moment,
but
I
heard
her
voice
pitilessly
sweet.
She
would
not
subdue
one
of
her
charms
in
compassion.
Perhaps
she
did
not
know
what
I
felt.
"'You
name
me
leopardess.
Remember,
the
leopardess
is
tameless,'
said
she.
"'Tame
or
fierce,
wild
or
subdued,
you
are
mine.'
"'I
am
glad
I
know
my
keeper
and
am
used
to
him.
Only
his
voice
will
I
follow;
only
his
hand
shall
manage
me;
only
at
his
feet
will
I
repose.'
"I
took
her
back
to
her
seat,
and
sat
down
by
her
side.
I
wanted
to
hear
her
speak
again.
I
could
never
have
enough
of
her
voice
and
her
words.
"'How
much
do
you
love
me?'
I
asked.
"'Ah!
you
know.
I
will
not
gratify
you
I
will
not
flatter.'
"'I
don't
know
half
enough;
my
heart
craves
to
be
fed.
If
you
knew
how
hungry
and
ferocious
it
is,
you
would
hasten
to
stay
it
with
a
kind
word
or
two.'
"'Poor
Tartar!'
said
she,
touching
and
patting
my
hand
'poor
fellow,
stalwart
friend,
Shirley's
pet
and
favourite,
lie
down!'
"'But
I
will
