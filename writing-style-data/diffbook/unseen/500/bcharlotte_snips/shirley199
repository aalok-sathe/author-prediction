sun.
That
sun
rose
broad
on
Whitsuntide.
The
gathering
of
the
schools
was
signalized
by
splendid
weather.
Whit
Tuesday
was
the
great
day,
in
preparation
for
which
the
two
large
schoolrooms
of
Briarfield,
built
by
the
present
rector,
chiefly
at
his
own
expense,
were
cleaned
out,
whitewashed,
repainted,
and
decorated
with
flowers
and
evergreens
some
from
the
rectory
garden,
two
cartloads
from
Fieldhead,
and
a
wheel
barrowful
from
the
more
stingy
domain
of
De
Walden,
the
residence
of
Mr.
Wynne.
In
these
schoolrooms
twenty
tables,
each
calculated
to
accommodate
twenty
guests,
were
laid
out,
surrounded
with
benches,
and
covered
with
white
cloths.
Above
them
were
suspended
at
least
some
twenty
cages,
containing
as
many
canaries,
according
to
a
fancy
of
the
district,
specially
cherished
by
Mr.
Helstone's
clerk,
who
delighted
in
the
piercing
song
of
these
birds,
and
knew
that
amidst
confusion
of
tongues
they
always
carolled
loudest.
These
tables,
be
it
understood,
were
not
spread
for
the
twelve
hundred
scholars
to
be
assembled
from
the
three
parishes,
but
only
for
the
patrons
and
teachers
of
the
schools.
The
children's
feast
was
to
be
spread
in
the
open
air.
At
one
o'clock
the
troops
were
to
come
in;
at
two
they
were
to
be
marshalled;
till
four
they
were
to
parade
the
parish;
then
came
the
feast,
and
afterwards
the
meeting,
with
music
and
speechifying
in
the
church.
Why
Briarfield
was
chosen
for
the
point
of
rendezvous
the
scene
of
the
fete
should
be
explained.
It
was
not
because
it
was
the
largest
or
most
populous
parish
Whinbury
far
outdid
it
in
that
respect;
nor
because
it
was
the
oldest,
antique
as
were
the
hoary
church
and
rectory
Nunnely's
low
roofed
temple
and
mossy
parsonage,
buried
both
in
coeval
oaks,
outstanding
sentinels
of
Nunnwood,
were
older
still.
It
was
simply
because
Mr.
Helstone
willed
it
so,
and
Mr.
Helstone's
will
was
stronger
than
that
of
Boultby
or
Hall;
the
former
could
not,
the
latter
would
not,
dispute
a
point
of
precedence
with
their
resolute
and
imperious
brother.
They
let
him
lead
and
rule.
This
notable
anniversary
had
always
hitherto
been
a
trying
day
to
Caroline
Helstone,
because
it
dragged
her
perforce
into
public,
compelling
her
to
face
all
that
was
wealthy,
respectable,
influential
in
the
neighbourhood;
in
whose
presence,
but
for
the
kind
countenance
of
Mr.
Hall,
she
would
have
appeared
unsupported.
Obliged
to
be
conspicuous;
obliged
to
walk
at
the
head
of
her
regiment
as
the
rector's
niece,
and
first
teacher
of
the
first
class;
obliged
to
make
tea
at
the
first
table
for
a
mixed
multitude
of
ladies
and
gentlemen,
and
to
do
all
this
without
the
countenance
of
mother,
aunt,
or
other
chaperon
she,
meantime,
being
a
nervous
person,
who
mortally
feared
publicity
it
will
be
comprehended
that,
under
these
circumstances,
she
trembled
at
the
approach
of
Whitsuntide.
But
this
year
Shirley
was
to
be
with
her,
and
that
changed
the
aspect
of
the
trial
singularly
it
changed
it
utterly.
It
was
a
trial
no
longer
it
