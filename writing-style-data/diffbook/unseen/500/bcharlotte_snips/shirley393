grew
so
thin
as
thin
as
you
are
now.
I
could
do
nothing
for
myself
neither
rise
nor
lie
down;
and
I
could
not
eat.
Yet
you
see
I
am
better."
"Comforter
sad
as
sweet.
I
am
too
feeble
to
say
what
I
feel;
but
while
you
speak
I
do
feel."
"Here
I
am
at
your
side,
where
I
thought
never
more
to
be.
Here
I
speak
to
you.
I
see
you
listen
to
me
willingly
look
at
me
kindly.
Did
I
count
on
that?
I
despaired."
Moore
sighed
a
sigh
so
deep
it
was
nearly
a
groan.
He
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand.
"May
I
be
spared
to
make
some
atonement."
Such
was
his
prayer.
"And
for
what?"
"We
will
not
touch
on
it
now,
Cary;
unmanned
as
I
am,
I
have
not
the
power
to
cope
with
such
a
topic.
Was
Mrs.
Pryor
with
you
during
your
illness?"
"Yes"
Caroline
smiled
brightly
"you
know
she
is
mamma?"
"I
have
heard
Hortense
told
me;
but
that
tale
too
I
will
receive
from
yourself.
Does
she
add
to
your
happiness?"
"What!
mamma?
She
is
dear
to
me;
how
dear
I
cannot
say.
I
was
altogether
weary,
and
she
held
me
up."
"I
deserve
to
hear
that
in
a
moment
when
I
can
scarce
lift
my
hand
to
my
head.
I
deserve
it."
"It
is
no
reproach
against
you."
"It
is
a
coal
of
fire
heaped
on
my
head;
and
so
is
every
word
you
address
to
me,
and
every
look
that
lights
your
sweet
face.
Come
still
nearer,
Lina;
and
give
me
your
hand
if
my
thin
fingers
do
not
scare
you."
She
took
those
thin
fingers
between
her
two
little
hands;
she
bent
her
head
et
les
effleura
de
ses
levres.
(I
put
that
in
French
because
the
word
effleurer
is
an
exquisite
word.)
Moore
was
much
moved.
A
large
tear
or
two
coursed
down
his
hollow
cheek.
"I'll
keep
these
things
in
my
heart,
Cary;
that
kiss
I
will
put
by,
and
you
shall
hear
of
it
again
one
day."
"Come
out!"
cried
Martin,
opening
the
door
"come
away;
you
have
had
twenty
minutes
instead
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour."
"She
will
not
stir
yet,
you
hempseed."
"I
dare
not
stay
longer,
Robert."
"Can
you
promise
to
return?"
"No,
she
can't,"
responded
Martin.
"The
thing
mustn't
become
customary.
I
can't
be
troubled.
It's
very
well
for
once;
I'll
not
have
it
repeated."
"You'll
not
have
it
repeated."
"Hush!
don't
vex
him;
we
could
not
have
met
to
day
but
for
him.
But
I
will
come
again,
if
it
is
your
wish
that
I
should
come."
"It
is
my
wish
my
one
wish
almost
the
only
wish
I
can
feel."
"Come
this
minute.
My
mother
has
coughed,
got
up,
set
her
feet
on
the
floor.
Let
her
only
catch
you
on
the
stairs,
Miss
Caroline.
You're
not
to
bid
him
good
bye"
stepping
between
her
and
Moore
"you
are
to
march."
"My
shawl,
Martin."
"I
have
it.
