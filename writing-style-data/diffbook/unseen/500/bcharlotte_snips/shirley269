help
them
to
reach
it?
Can
you
give
them
a
field
in
which
their
faculties
may
be
exercised
and
grow?
Men
of
England!
look
at
your
poor
girls,
many
of
them
fading
around
you,
dropping
off
in
consumption
or
decline;
or,
what
is
worse,
degenerating
to
sour
old
maids
envious,
back
biting,
wretched,
because
life
is
a
desert
to
them;
or,
what
is
worst
of
all,
reduced
to
strive,
by
scarce
modest
coquetry
and
debasing
artifice,
to
gain
that
position
and
consideration
by
marriage
which
to
celibacy
is
denied.
Fathers!
cannot
you
alter
these
things?
Perhaps
not
all
at
once;
but
consider
the
matter
well
when
it
is
brought
before
you,
receive
it
as
a
theme
worthy
of
thought;
do
not
dismiss
it
with
an
idle
jest
or
an
unmanly
insult.
You
would
wish
to
be
proud
of
your
daughters,
and
not
to
blush
for
them;
then
seek
for
them
an
interest
and
an
occupation
which
shall
raise
them
above
the
flirt,
the
maneauvrer,
the
mischief
making
tale
bearer.
Keep
your
girls'
minds
narrow
and
fettered;
they
will
still
be
a
plague
and
a
care,
sometimes
a
disgrace
to
you.
Cultivate
them
give
them
scope
and
work;
they
will
be
your
gayest
companions
in
health,
your
tenderest
nurses
in
sickness,
your
most
faithful
prop
in
age."
One
fine
summer
day
that
Caroline
had
spent
entirely
alone
(her
uncle
being
at
Whinbury),
and
whose
long,
bright,
noiseless,
breezeless,
cloudless
hours
(how
many
they
seemed
since
sunrise!)
had
been
to
her
as
desolate
as
if
they
had
gone
over
her
head
in
the
shadowless
and
trackless
wastes
of
Sahara,
instead
of
in
the
blooming
garden
of
an
English
home,
she
was
sitting
in
the
alcove
her
task
of
work
on
her
knee,
her
fingers
assiduously
plying
the
needle,
her
eyes
following
and
regulating
their
movements,
her
brain
working
restlessly
when
Fanny
came
to
the
door,
looked
round
over
the
lawn
and
borders,
and
not
seeing
her
whom
she
sought,
called
out,
"Miss
Caroline!"
A
low
voice
answered
"Fanny!"
It
issued
from
the
alcove,
and
thither
Fanny
hastened,
a
note
in
her
hand,
which
she
delivered
to
fingers
that
hardly
seemed
to
have
nerve
to
hold
it.
Miss
Helstone
did
not
ask
whence
it
came,
and
she
did
not
look
at
it;
she
let
it
drop
amongst
the
folds
of
her
work.
"Joe
Scott's
son,
Harry,
brought
it,"
said
Fanny.
The
girl
was
no
enchantress,
and
knew
no
magic
spell;
yet
what
she
said
took
almost
magical
effect
on
her
young
mistress.
She
lifted
her
head
with
the
quick
motion
of
revived
sensation;
she
shot,
not
a
languid,
but
a
lifelike,
questioning
glance
at
Fanny.
"Harry
Scott!
who
sent
him?"
"He
came
from
the
Hollow."
The
dropped
note
was
snatched
up
eagerly,
the
seal
was
broken
it
was
read
in
two
seconds.
An
affectionate
billet
from
Hortense,
informing
her
young
cousin
that
she
was
returned
from
Wormwood
Wells;
that
she
was
alone
to
day,
as
Robert
was
gone
to
Whinbury
market;
that
