at
the
steel!
She
has
dreams
of
her
wild
woods
and
pinings
after
virgin
freedom.
I
wish
Sympson
would
come
again,
and
oblige
her
again
to
entwine
her
arms
about
me.
I
wish
there
was
danger
she
should
lose
me,
as
there
is
risk
I
shall
lose
her.
No;
final
loss
I
do
not
fear,
but
long
delay
"It
is
now
night
midnight.
I
have
spent
the
afternoon
and
evening
at
Fieldhead.
Some
hours
ago
she
passed
me,
coming
down
the
oak
staircase
to
the
hall.
She
did
not
know
I
was
standing
in
the
twilight,
near
the
staircase
window,
looking
at
the
frost
bright
constellations.
How
closely
she
glided
against
the
banisters!
How
shyly
shone
her
large
eyes
upon
me!
How
evanescent,
fugitive,
fitful
she
looked
slim
and
swift
as
a
northern
streamer!
"I
followed
her
into
the
drawing
room.
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Caroline
Helstone
were
both
there;
she
has
summoned
them
to
bear
her
company
awhile.
In
her
white
evening
dress,
with
her
long
hair
flowing
full
and
wavy,
with
her
noiseless
step,
her
pale
cheek,
her
eye
full
of
night
and
lightning,
she
looked,
I
thought,
spirit
like
a
thing
made
of
an
element,
the
child
of
a
breeze
and
a
flame,
the
daughter
of
ray
and
raindrop
a
thing
never
to
be
overtaken,
arrested,
fixed.
I
wished
I
could
avoid
following
her
with
my
gaze
as
she
moved
here
and
there,
but
it
was
impossible.
I
talked
with
the
other
ladies
as
well
as
I
could,
but
still
I
looked
at
her.
She
was
very
silent;
I
think
she
never
spoke
to
me
not
even
when
she
offered
me
tea.
It
happened
that
she
was
called
out
a
minute
by
Mrs.
Gill.
I
passed
into
the
moonlit
hall,
with
the
design
of
getting
a
word
as
she
returned;
nor
in
this
did
I
fail.
"'Miss
Keeldar,
stay
one
instant,'
said
I,
meeting
her.
"'Why?
the
hall
is
too
cold.'
"'It
is
not
cold
for
me;
at
my
side
it
should
not
be
cold
for
you.'
"'But
I
shiver.'
"'With
fear,
I
believe.
What
makes
you
fear
me?
You
are
quiet
and
distant.
Why?'
"'I
may
well
fear
what
looks
like
a
great
dark
goblin
meeting
me
in
the
moonlight.'
"'Do
not
do
not
pass!
Stay
with
me
awhile.
Let
us
exchange
a
few
quiet
words.
It
is
three
days
since
I
spoke
to
you
alone.
Such
changes
are
cruel.'
"'I
have
no
wish
to
be
cruel,'
she
responded,
softly
enough.
Indeed
there
was
softness
in
her
whole
deportment
in
her
face,
in
her
voice;
but
there
was
also
reserve,
and
an
air
fleeting,
evanishing,
intangible.
"'You
certainly
give
me
pain,'
said
I.
'It
is
hardly
a
week
since
you
called
me
your
future
husband
and
treated
me
as
such.
Now
I
am
once
more
the
tutor
for
you.
I
am
addressed
as
Mr.
Moore
and
sir.
Your
lips
have
forgotten
Louis.'
"'No,
Louis,
no.
It
is
an
easy,
liquid
name
not
soon
forgotten.'
"'Be
cordial
to
