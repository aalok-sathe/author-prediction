are
harrowing.
"My
darling,
do
you
know
me?"
said
Mrs.
Pryor.
"I
went
in
to
call
Robert
to
breakfast.
I
have
been
with
him
in
the
garden.
He
asked
me
to
go.
A
heavy
dew
has
refreshed
the
flowers.
The
peaches
are
ripening."
"My
darling!
my
darling!"
again
and
again
repeated
the
nurse.
"I
thought
it
was
daylight
long
after
sunrise.
It
looks
dark.
Is
the
moon
now
set?"
That
moon,
lately
risen,
was
gazing
full
and
mild
upon
her.
Floating
in
deep
blue
space,
it
watched
her
unclouded.
"Then
it
is
not
morning?
I
am
not
at
the
cottage?
Who
is
this?
I
see
a
shape
at
my
bedside."
"It
is
myself
it
is
your
friend
your
nurse
your
Lean
your
head
on
my
shoulder.
Collect
yourself."
In
a
lower
tone
"O
God,
take
pity!
Give
her
life,
and
me
strength!
Send
me
courage!
Teach
me
words!"
Some
minutes
passed
in
silence.
The
patient
lay
mute
and
passive
in
the
trembling
arms,
on
the
throbbing
bosom
of
the
nurse.
"I
am
better
now,"
whispered
Caroline
at
last,
"much
better.
I
feel
where
I
am.
This
is
Mrs.
Pryor
near
me.
I
was
dreaming.
I
talk
when
I
wake
up
from
dreams;
people
often
do
in
illness.
How
fast
your
heart
beats,
ma'am!
Do
not
be
afraid."
"It
is
not
fear,
child
only
a
little
anxiety,
which
will
pass.
I
have
brought
you
some
tea,
Cary.
Your
uncle
made
it
himself.
You
know
he
says
he
can
make
a
better
cup
of
tea
than
any
housewife
can.
Taste
it.
He
is
concerned
to
hear
that
you
eat
so
little;
he
would
be
glad
if
you
had
a
better
appetite."
"I
am
thirsty.
Let
me
drink."
She
drank
eagerly.
"What
o'clock
is
it,
ma'am?"
she
asked.
"Past
nine."
"Not
later?
Oh!
I
have
yet
a
long
night
before
me.
But
the
tea
has
made
me
strong.
I
will
sit
up."
Mrs.
Pryor
raised
her,
and
arranged
her
pillows.
"Thank
Heaven!
I
am
not
always
equally
miserable,
and
ill,
and
hopeless.
The
afternoon
has
been
bad
since
Hortense
went;
perhaps
the
evening
may
be
better.
It
is
a
fine
night,
I
think?
The
moon
shines
clear."
"Very
fine
a
perfect
summer
night.
The
old
church
tower
gleams
white
almost
as
silver."
"And
does
the
churchyard
look
peaceful?"
"Yes,
and
the
garden
also.
Dew
glistens
on
the
foliage."
"Can
you
see
many
long
weeds
and
nettles
amongst
the
graves?
or
do
they
look
turfy
and
flowery?"
"I
see
closed
daisy
heads
gleaming
like
pearls
on
some
mounds.
Thomas
has
mown
down
the
dock
leaves
and
rank
grass,
and
cleared
all
away."
"I
always
like
that
to
be
done;
it
soothes
one's
mind
to
see
the
place
in
order.
And,
I
dare
say,
within
the
church
just
now
that
moonlight
shines
as
softly
as
in
my
room.
It
will
fall
through
the
east
window
full
on
the
Helstone
monument.
When
I
close
my
eyes
I
seem
to
see
poor
papa's
epitaph
in
black
letters
