the
wisdom
in
the
world
is
lodged
in
male
skulls?"
"I
think
that
women
are
a
kittle
and
a
froward
generation;
and
I've
a
great
respect
for
the
doctrines
delivered
in
the
second
chapter
of
St.
Paul's
first
Epistle
to
Timothy."
"What
doctrines,
Joe?"
"'Let
the
woman
learn
in
silence,
with
all
subjection.
I
suffer
not
a
woman
to
teach,
nor
to
usurp
authority
over
the
man,
but
to
be
in
silence.
For
Adam
was
first
formed,
then
Eve.'"
"What
has
that
to
do
with
the
business?"
interjected
Shirley.
"That
smacks
of
rights
of
primogeniture.
I'll
bring
it
up
to
Mr.
Yorke
the
first
time
he
inveighs
against
those
rights."
"And,"
continued
Joe
Scott,
"Adam
was
not
deceived,
but
the
woman
being
deceived
was
in
the
transgression."
"More
shame
to
Adam
to
sin
with
his
eyes
open!"
cried
Miss
Keeldar.
"To
confess
the
honest
truth,
Joe,
I
never
was
easy
in
my
mind
concerning
that
chapter.
It
puzzles
me."
"It
is
very
plain,
miss.
He
that
runs
may
read."
"He
may
read
it
in
his
own
fashion,"
remarked
Caroline,
now
joining
in
the
dialogue
for
the
first
time.
"You
allow
the
right
of
private
judgment,
I
suppose,
Joe?"
"My
certy,
that
I
do!
I
allow
and
claim
it
for
every
line
of
the
holy
Book."
"Women
may
exercise
it
as
well
as
men?"
"Nay.
Women
is
to
take
their
husbands'
opinion,
both
in
politics
and
religion.
It's
wholesomest
for
them."
"Oh!
oh!"
exclaimed
both
Shirley
and
Caroline.
"To
be
sure;
no
doubt
on't,"
persisted
the
stubborn
overlooker.
"Consider
yourself
groaned
down,
and
cried
shame
over,
for
such
a
stupid
observation,"
said
Miss
Keeldar.
"You
might
as
well
say
men
are
to
take
the
opinions
of
their
priests
without
examination.
Of
what
value
would
a
religion
so
adopted
be?
It
would
be
mere
blind,
besotted
superstition."
"And
what
is
your
reading,
Miss
Helstone,
o'
these
words
o'
St.
Paul's?"
"Hem!
I
I
account
for
them
in
this
way.
He
wrote
that
chapter
for
a
particular
congregation
of
Christians,
under
peculiar
circumstances;
and
besides,
I
dare
say,
if
I
could
read
the
original
Greek,
I
should
find
that
many
of
the
words
have
been
wrongly
translated,
perhaps
misapprehended
altogether.
It
would
be
possible,
I
doubt
not,
with
a
little
ingenuity,
to
give
the
passage
quite
a
contrary
turn
to
make
it
say,
'Let
the
woman
speak
out
whenever
she
sees
fit
to
make
an
objection.'
'It
is
permitted
to
a
woman
to
teach
and
to
exercise
authority
as
much
as
may
be.
Man,
meantime,
cannot
do
better
than
hold
his
peace;'
and
so
on."
"That
willn't
wash,
miss."
"I
dare
say
it
will.
My
notions
are
dyed
in
faster
colours
than
yours,
Joe.
Mr.
Scott,
you
are
a
thoroughly
dogmatical
person,
and
always
were.
I
like
William
better
than
you."
"Joe
is
well
enough
in
his
own
house,"
said
Shirley.
"I
have
seen
him
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
at
home.
There
is
not
a
better
nor
a
kinder
husband
in
Briarfield.
