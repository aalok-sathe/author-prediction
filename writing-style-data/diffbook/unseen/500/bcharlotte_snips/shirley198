came
to
my
rescue,
from
what
hand
I
received
the
loan
which
saved
me.
It
is
on
the
strength
of
that
loan
I
am
enabled
to
continue
the
bold
game
which,
a
while
since,
I
feared
I
should
never
play
more.
Total
ruin
I
know
will
follow
loss,
and
I
am
aware
that
gain
is
doubtful;
but
I
am
quite
cheerful.
So
long
as
I
can
be
active,
so
long
as
I
can
strive,
so
long,
in
short,
as
my
hands
are
not
tied,
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
be
depressed.
One
year
nay,
but
six
months
of
the
reign
of
the
olive,
and
I
am
safe;
for,
as
you
say,
peace
will
give
an
impulse
to
commerce.
In
this
you
are
right;
but
as
to
the
restored
tranquillity
of
the
neighbourhood,
as
to
the
permanent
good
effect
of
your
charitable
fund,
I
doubt.
Eleemosynary
relief
never
yet
tranquillized
the
working
classes
it
never
made
them
grateful;
it
is
not
in
human
nature
that
it
should.
I
suppose,
were
all
things
ordered
aright,
they
ought
not
to
be
in
a
position
to
need
that
humiliating
relief;
and
this
they
feel.
We
should
feel
it
were
we
so
placed.
Besides,
to
whom
should
they
be
grateful?
To
you,
to
the
clergy
perhaps,
but
not
to
us
mill
owners.
They
hate
us
worse
than
ever.
Then
the
disaffected
here
are
in
correspondence
with
the
disaffected
elsewhere.
Nottingham
is
one
of
their
headquarters,
Manchester
another,
Birmingham
a
third.
The
subalterns
receive
orders
from
their
chiefs;
they
are
in
a
good
state
of
discipline;
no
blow
is
struck
without
mature
deliberation.
In
sultry
weather
you
have
seen
the
sky
threaten
thunder
day
by
day,
and
yet
night
after
night
the
clouds
have
cleared,
and
the
sun
has
set
quietly;
but
the
danger
was
not
gone
it
was
only
delayed.
The
long
threatening
storm
is
sure
to
break
at
last.
There
is
analogy
between
the
moral
and
physical
atmosphere."
"Well,
Mr.
Moore"
(so
these
conferences
always
ended),
"take
care
of
yourself.
If
you
think
that
I
have
ever
done
you
any
good,
reward
me
by
promising
to
take
care
of
yourself."
"I
do;
I
will
take
close
and
watchful
care.
I
wish
to
live,
not
to
die.
The
future
opens
like
Eden
before
me;
and
still,
when
I
look
deep
into
the
shades
of
my
paradise,
I
see
a
vision
that
I
like
better
than
seraph
or
cherub
glide
across
remote
vistas."
"Do
you?
Pray,
what
vision?"
"I
see
"
The
maid
came
bustling
in
with
the
tea
things.
The
early
part
of
that
May,
as
we
have
seen,
was
fine;
the
middle
was
wet;
but
in
the
last
week,
at
change
of
moon,
it
cleared
again.
A
fresh
wind
swept
off
the
silver
white,
deep
piled
rain
clouds,
bearing
them,
mass
on
mass,
to
the
eastern
horizon,
on
whose
verge
they
dwindled,
and
behind
whose
rim
they
disappeared,
leaving
the
vault
behind
all
pure
blue
space,
ready
for
the
reign
of
the
summer
