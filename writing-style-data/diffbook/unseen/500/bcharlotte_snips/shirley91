in
the
yard,
some
in
their
shirt
sleeves,
some
in
blue
aprons.
Two
figured
conspicuously
in
the
van
of
the
party.
One,
a
little
dapper
strutting
man
with
a
turned
up
nose;
the
other
a
broad
shouldered
fellow,
distinguished
no
less
by
his
demure
face
and
cat
like,
trustless
eyes
than
by
a
wooden
leg
and
stout
crutch.
There
was
a
kind
of
leer
about
his
lips;
he
seemed
laughing
in
his
sleeve
at
some
person
or
thing;
his
whole
air
was
anything
but
that
of
a
true
man.
"Good
morning,
Mr.
Barraclough,"
said
Moore
debonairly,
for
him.
"Peace
be
unto
you!"
was
the
answer,
Mr.
Barraclough
entirely
closing
his
naturally
half
shut
eyes
as
he
delivered
it.
"I'm
obliged
to
you.
Peace
is
an
excellent
thing;
there's
nothing
I
more
wish
for
myself.
But
that
is
not
all
you
have
to
say
to
me,
I
suppose?
I
imagine
peace
is
not
your
purpose?"
"As
to
our
purpose,"
began
Barraclough,
"it's
one
that
may
sound
strange
and
perhaps
foolish
to
ears
like
yours,
for
the
childer
of
this
world
is
wiser
in
their
generation
than
the
childer
of
light."
"To
the
point,
if
you
please,
and
let
me
hear
what
it
is."
"Ye'se
hear,
sir.
If
I
cannot
get
it
off,
there's
eleven
behint
can
help
me.
It
is
a
grand
purpose,
and"
(changing
his
voice
from
a
half
sneer
to
a
whine)
"it's
the
Looard's
own
purpose,
and
that's
better."
"Do
you
want
a
subscription
to
a
new
Ranter's
chapel,
Mr.
Barraclough?
Unless
your
errand
be
something
of
that
sort,
I
cannot
see
what
you
have
to
do
with
it."
"I
hadn't
that
duty
on
my
mind,
sir;
but
as
Providence
has
led
ye
to
mention
the
subject,
I'll
make
it
i'
my
way
to
tak
ony
trifle
ye
may
have
to
spare;
the
smallest
contribution
will
be
acceptable."
With
that
he
doffed
his
hat,
and
held
it
out
as
a
begging
box,
a
brazen
grin
at
the
same
time
crossing
his
countenance.
"If
I
gave
you
sixpence
you
would
drink
it."
Barraclough
uplifted
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
the
whites
of
his
eyes,
evincing
in
the
gesture
a
mere
burlesque
of
hypocrisy.
"You
seem
a
fine
fellow,"
said
Moore,
quite
coolly
and
dryly;
"you
don't
care
for
showing
me
that
you
are
a
double
dyed
hypocrite,
that
your
trade
is
fraud.
You
expect
indeed
to
make
me
laugh
at
the
cleverness
with
which
you
play
your
coarsely
farcical
part,
while
at
the
same
time
you
think
you
are
deceiving
the
men
behind
you."
Moses'
countenance
lowered.
He
saw
he
had
gone
too
far.
He
was
going
to
answer,
when
the
second
leader,
impatient
of
being
hitherto
kept
in
the
background,
stepped
forward.
This
man
did
not
look
like
a
traitor,
though
he
had
an
exceedingly
self
confident
and
conceited
air.
"Mr.
Moore,"
commenced
he,
speaking
also
in
his
throat
and
nose,
and
enunciating
each
word
very
slowly,
as
if
with
a
view
to
giving
his
audience
time
