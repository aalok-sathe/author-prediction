They
are
never
well,
and
their
minds
and
views
shrink
to
wondrous
narrowness.
The
great
wish,
the
sole
aim
of
every
one
of
them
is
to
be
married,
but
the
majority
will
never
marry;
they
will
die
as
they
now
live.
They
scheme,
they
plot,
they
dress
to
ensnare
husbands.
The
gentlemen
turn
them
into
ridicule;
they
don't
want
them;
they
hold
them
very
cheap.
They
say
I
have
heard
them
say
it
with
sneering
laughs
many
a
time
the
matrimonial
market
is
overstocked.
Fathers
say
so
likewise,
and
are
angry
with
their
daughters
when
they
observe
their
maneauvres
they
order
them
to
stay
at
home.
What
do
they
expect
them
to
do
at
home?
If
you
ask,
they
would
answer,
sew
and
cook.
They
expect
them
to
do
this,
and
this
only,
contentedly,
regularly,
uncomplainingly,
all
their
lives
long,
as
if
they
had
no
germs
of
faculties
for
anything
else
a
doctrine
as
reasonable
to
hold
as
it
would
be
that
the
fathers
have
no
faculties
but
for
eating
what
their
daughters
cook
or
for
wearing
what
they
sew.
Could
men
live
so
themselves?
Would
they
not
be
very
weary?
And
when
there
came
no
relief
to
their
weariness,
but
only
reproaches
at
its
slightest
manifestation,
would
not
their
weariness
ferment
it
time
to
frenzy?
Lucretia,
spinning
at
midnight
in
the
midst
of
her
maidens,
and
Solomon's
virtuous
woman
are
often
quoted
as
patterns
of
what
'the
sex,'
as
they
say,
ought
to
be.
I
don't
know.
Lucretia,
I
dare
say,
was
a
most
worthy
sort
of
person,
much
like
my
cousin
Hortense
Moore;
but
she
kept
her
servants
up
very
late.
I
should
not
have
liked
to
be
amongst
the
number
of
the
maidens.
Hortense
would
just
work
me
and
Sarah
in
that
fashion,
if
she
could,
and
neither
of
us
would
bear
it.
The
'virtuous
woman,'
again,
had
her
household
up
in
the
very
middle
of
the
night;
she
'got
breakfast
over,'
as
Mrs.
Sykes
says,
before
one
o'clock
a.m.;
but
she
had
something
more
to
do
than
spin
and
give
out
portions.
She
was
a
manufacturer
she
made
fine
linen
and
sold
it;
she
was
an
agriculturist
she
bought
estates
and
planted
vineyards.
That
woman
was
a
manager.
She
was
what
the
matrons
hereabouts
call
'a
clever
woman.'
On
the
whole,
I
like
her
a
good
deal
better
than
Lucretia;
but
I
don't
believe
either
Mr.
Armitage
or
Mr.
Sykes
could
have
got
the
advantage
of
her
in
a
bargain.
Yet
I
like
her.
'Strength
and
honour
were
her
clothing;
the
heart
of
her
husband
safely
trusted
in
her.
She
opened
her
mouth
with
wisdom;
in
her
tongue
was
the
law
of
kindness;
her
children
rose
up
and
called
her
blessed;
her
husband
also
praised
her.'
King
of
Israel!
your
model
of
a
woman
is
a
worthy
model!
But
are
we,
in
these
days,
brought
up
to
be
like
her?
Men
of
Yorkshire!
do
your
daughters
reach
this
royal
standard?
Can
they
reach
it?
Can
you
