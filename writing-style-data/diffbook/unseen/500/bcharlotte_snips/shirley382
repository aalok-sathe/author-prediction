In
his
face
there
is
as
little
of
amenity
as
of
servility,
his
eye
seems
prepared
to
note
any
incipient
attempt
to
control
or
overreach
him,
and
the
rest
of
his
features
indicate
faculties
alert
for
resistance.
Wise
ushers
avoid
unnecessary
interference
with
that
lad.
To
break
him
in
by
severity
would
be
a
useless
attempt;
to
win
him
by
flattery
would
be
an
effort
worse
than
useless.
He
is
best
let
alone.
Time
will
educate
and
experience
train
him.
Professedly
Martin
Yorke
(it
is
a
young
Yorke,
of
course)
tramples
on
the
name
of
poetry.
Talk
sentiment
to
him,
and
you
would
be
answered
by
sarcasm.
Here
he
is,
wandering
alone,
waiting
duteously
on
Nature,
while
she
unfolds
a
page
of
stern,
of
silent,
and
of
solemn
poetry
beneath
his
attentive
gaze.
Being
seated,
he
takes
from
his
satchel
a
book
not
the
Latin
grammar,
but
a
contraband
volume
of
fairy
tales.
There
will
be
light
enough
yet
for
an
hour
to
serve
his
keen
young
vision.
Besides,
the
moon
waits
on
him;
her
beam,
dim
and
vague
as
yet,
fills
the
glade
where
he
sits.
He
reads.
He
is
led
into
a
solitary
mountain
region;
all
round
him
is
rude
and
desolate,
shapeless,
and
almost
colourless.
He
hears
bells
tinkle
on
the
wind.
Forth
riding
from
the
formless
folds
of
the
mist
dawns
on
him
the
brightest
vision
a
green
robed
lady,
on
a
snow
white
palfrey.
He
sees
her
dress,
her
gems,
and
her
steed.
She
arrests
him
with
some
mysterious
question.
He
is
spell
bound,
and
must
follow
her
into
fairyland.
A
second
legend
bears
him
to
the
sea
shore.
There
tumbles
in
a
strong
tide,
boiling
at
the
base
of
dizzy
cliffs.
It
rains
and
blows.
A
reef
of
rocks,
black
and
rough,
stretches
far
into
the
sea.
All
along,
and
among,
and
above
these
crags
dash
and
flash,
sweep
and
leap,
swells,
wreaths,
drifts
of
snowy
spray.
Some
lone
wanderer
is
out
on
these
rocks,
treading
with
cautious
step
the
wet,
wild
seaweed;
glancing
down
into
hollows
where
the
brine
lies
fathoms
deep
and
emerald
clear,
and
seeing
there
wilder
and
stranger
and
huger
vegetation
than
is
found
on
land,
with
treasure
of
shells
some
green,
some
purple,
some
pearly
clustered
in
the
curls
of
the
snaky
plants.
He
hears
a
cry.
Looking
up
and
forward,
he
sees,
at
the
bleak
point
of
the
reef,
a
tall,
pale
thing
shaped
like
man,
but
made
of
spray
transparent,
tremulous,
awful.
It
stands
not
alone.
They
are
all
human
figures
that
wanton
in
the
rocks
a
crowd
of
foam
women
a
band
of
white,
evanescent
Nereids.
Hush!
Shut
the
book;
hide
it
in
the
satchel.
Martin
hears
a
tread.
He
listens.
No
yes.
Once
more
the
dead
leaves,
lightly
crushed,
rustle
on
the
wood
path.
Martin
watches;
the
trees
part,
and
a
woman
issues
forth.
She
is
a
lady
dressed
in
dark
silk,
a
veil
covering
her
face.
Martin
never
met
a
lady
in
this
wood
