and
that
the
proportion
is
not
determined
by
station.
I
have
seen
villains
who
were
rich,
and
I
have
seen
villains
who
were
poor,
and
I
have
seen
villains
who
were
neither
rich
nor
poor,
but
who
had
realized
Agar's
wish,
and
lived
in
fair
and
modest
competency.
The
clock
is
going
to
strike
six.
Away
with
you,
Joe,
and
ring
the
mill
bell."
It
was
now
the
middle
of
the
month
of
February;
by
six
o'clock
therefore
dawn
was
just
beginning
to
steal
on
night,
to
penetrate
with
a
pale
ray
its
brown
obscurity,
and
give
a
demi
translucence
to
its
opaque
shadows.
Pale
enough
that
ray
was
on
this
particular
morning:
no
colour
tinged
the
east,
no
flush
warmed
it.
To
see
what
a
heavy
lid
day
slowly
lifted,
what
a
wan
glance
she
flung
along
the
hills,
you
would
have
thought
the
sun's
fire
quenched
in
last
night's
floods.
The
breath
of
this
morning
was
chill
as
its
aspect;
a
raw
wind
stirred
the
mass
of
night
cloud,
and
showed,
as
it
slowly
rose,
leaving
a
colourless,
silver
gleaming
ring
all
round
the
horizon,
not
blue
sky,
but
a
stratum
of
paler
vapour
beyond.
It
had
ceased
to
rain,
but
the
earth
was
sodden,
and
the
pools
and
rivulets
were
full.
The
mill
windows
were
alight,
the
bell
still
rung
loud,
and
now
the
little
children
came
running
in,
in
too
great
a
hurry,
let
us
hope,
to
feel
very
much
nipped
by
the
inclement
air;
and
indeed,
by
contrast,
perhaps
the
morning
appeared
rather
favourable
to
them
than
otherwise,
for
they
had
often
come
to
their
work
that
winter
through
snow
storms,
through
heavy
rain,
through
hard
frost.
Mr.
Moore
stood
at
the
entrance
to
watch
them
pass.
He
counted
them
as
they
went
by.
To
those
who
came
rather
late
he
said
a
word
of
reprimand,
which
was
a
little
more
sharply
repeated
by
Joe
Scott
when
the
lingerers
reached
the
work
rooms.
Neither
master
nor
overlooker
spoke
savagely.
They
were
not
savage
men
either
of
them,
though
it
appeared
both
were
rigid,
for
they
fined
a
delinquent
who
came
considerably
too
late.
Mr.
Moore
made
him
pay
his
penny
down
ere
he
entered,
and
informed
him
that
the
next
repetition
of
the
fault
would
cost
him
twopence.
Rules,
no
doubt,
are
necessary
in
such
cases,
and
coarse
and
cruel
masters
will
make
coarse
and
cruel
rules,
which,
at
the
time
we
treat
of
at
least,
they
used
sometimes
to
enforce
tyrannically;
but
though
I
describe
imperfect
characters
(every
character
in
this
book
will
be
found
to
be
more
or
less
imperfect,
my
pen
refusing
to
draw
anything
in
the
model
line),
I
have
not
undertaken
to
handle
degraded
or
utterly
infamous
ones.
Child
torturers,
slave
masters
and
drivers,
I
consign
to
the
hands
of
jailers.
The
novelist
may
be
excused
from
sullying
his
page
with
the
record
of
their
deeds.
Instead,
then,
of
harrowing
up
my
reader's
soul
and
delighting
his
organ
of
wonder
