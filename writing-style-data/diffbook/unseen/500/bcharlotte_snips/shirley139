"Yes,"
said
her
pupil,
"I
know
what
that
smile
means.
You
are
thinking
of
my
gentleman
tenant.
Do
you
know
Mr.
Moore
of
the
Hollow?"
she
asked
Mr.
Helstone.
"Ay!
ay!
Your
tenant
so
he
is.
You
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
him,
no
doubt,
since
you
came?"
"I
have
been
obliged
to
see
him.
There
was
business
to
transact.
Business!
Really
the
word
makes
me
conscious
I
am
indeed
no
longer
a
girl,
but
quite
a
woman
and
something
more.
I
am
an
esquire!
Shirley
Keeldar,
Esquire,
ought
to
be
my
style
and
title.
They
gave
me
a
man's
name;
I
hold
a
man's
position.
It
is
enough
to
inspire
me
with
a
touch
of
manhood;
and
when
I
see
such
people
as
that
stately
Anglo
Belgian
that
Gerard
Moore
before
me,
gravely
talking
to
me
of
business,
really
I
feel
quite
gentlemanlike.
You
must
choose
me
for
your
churchwarden,
Mr.
Helstone,
the
next
time
you
elect
new
ones.
They
ought
to
make
me
a
magistrate
and
a
captain
of
yeomanry.
Tony
Lumpkin's
mother
was
a
colonel,
and
his
aunt
a
justice
of
the
peace.
Why
shouldn't
I
be?"
"With
all
my
heart.
If
you
choose
to
get
up
a
requisition
on
the
subject,
I
promise
to
head
the
list
of
signatures
with
my
name.
But
you
were
speaking
of
Moore?"
"Ah!
yes.
I
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
understand
Mr.
Moore,
to
know
what
to
think
of
him,
whether
to
like
him
or
not.
He
seems
a
tenant
of
whom
any
proprietor
might
be
proud
and
proud
of
him
I
am,
in
that
sense;
but
as
a
neighbour,
what
is
he?
Again
and
again
I
have
entreated
Mrs.
Pryor
to
say
what
she
thinks
of
him,
but
she
still
evades
returning
a
direct
answer.
I
hope
you
will
be
less
oracular,
Mr.
Helstone,
and
pronounce
at
once.
Do
you
like
him?"
"Not
at
all,
just
now.
His
name
is
entirely
blotted
from
my
good
books."
"What
is
the
matter?
What
has
he
done?"
"My
uncle
and
he
disagree
on
politics,"
interposed
the
low
voice
of
Caroline.
She
had
better
not
have
spoken
just
then.
Having
scarcely
joined
in
the
conversation
before,
it
was
not
apropos
to
do
it
now.
She
felt
this
with
nervous
acuteness
as
soon
as
she
had
spoken,
and
coloured
to
the
eyes.
"What
are
Moore's
politics?"
inquired
Shirley.
"Those
of
a
tradesman,"
returned
the
rector
"narrow,
selfish,
and
unpatriotic.
The
man
is
eternally
writing
and
speaking
against
the
continuance
of
the
war.
I
have
no
patience
with
him."
"The
war
hurts
his
trade.
I
remember
he
remarked
that
only
yesterday.
But
what
other
objection
have
you
to
him?"
"That
is
enough."
"He
looks
the
gentleman,
in
my
sense
of
the
term,"
pursued
Shirley,
"and
it
pleases
me
to
think
he
is
such."
Caroline
rent
the
Tyrian
petals
of
the
one
brilliant
flower
in
her
bouquet,
and
answered
in
distinct
tones,
"Decidedly
he
is."
Shirley,
hearing
this
courageous
affirmation,
flashed
an
arch,
