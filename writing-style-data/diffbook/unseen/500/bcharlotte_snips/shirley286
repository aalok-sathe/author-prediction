this
speech.
Over
her
features
ran
a
tremor,
which
for
some
minutes
she
was
absorbed
in
repressing.
"You
are
more
used
to
Fanny
than
to
me,"
she
remarked
ere
long.
"I
should
think
my
attendance
must
seem
strange,
officious?"
"No;
quite
natural,
and
very
soothing.
You
must
have
been
accustomed
to
wait
on
sick
people,
ma'am.
You
move
about
the
room
so
softly,
and
you
speak
so
quietly,
and
touch
me
so
gently."
"I
am
dexterous
in
nothing,
my
dear.
You
will
often
find
me
awkward,
but
never
negligent."
Negligent,
indeed,
she
was
not.
From
that
hour
Fanny
and
Eliza
became
ciphers
in
the
sick
room.
Mrs.
Pryor
made
it
her
domain;
she
performed
all
its
duties;
she
lived
in
it
day
and
night.
The
patient
remonstrated
faintly,
however,
from
the
first,
and
not
at
all
ere
long.
Loneliness
and
gloom
were
now
banished
from
her
bedside;
protection
and
solace
sat
there
instead.
She
and
her
nurse
coalesced
in
wondrous
union.
Caroline
was
usually
pained
to
require
or
receive
much
attendance.
Mrs.
Pryor,
under
ordinary
circumstances,
had
neither
the
habit
nor
the
art
of
performing
little
offices
of
service;
but
all
now
passed
with
such
ease,
so
naturally,
that
the
patient
was
as
willing
to
be
cherished
as
the
nurse
was
bent
on
cherishing;
no
sign
of
weariness
in
the
latter
ever
reminded
the
former
that
she
ought
to
be
anxious.
There
was,
in
fact,
no
very
hard
duty
to
perform;
but
a
hireling
might
have
found
it
hard.
With
all
this
care
it
seemed
strange
the
sick
girl
did
not
get
well;
yet
such
was
the
case.
She
wasted
like
any
snow
wreath
in
thaw;
she
faded
like
any
flower
in
drought.
Miss
Keeldar,
on
whose
thoughts
danger
or
death
seldom
intruded,
had
at
first
entertained
no
fears
at
all
for
her
friend;
but
seeing
her
change
and
sink
from
time
to
time
when
she
paid
her
visits,
alarm
clutched
her
heart.
She
went
to
Mr.
Helstone
and
expressed
herself
with
so
much
energy
that
that
gentleman
was
at
last
obliged,
however
unwillingly,
to
admit
the
idea
that
his
niece
was
ill
of
something
more
than
a
migraine;
and
when
Mrs.
Pryor
came
and
quietly
demanded
a
physician,
he
said
she
might
send
for
two
if
she
liked.
One
came,
but
that
one
was
an
oracle.
He
delivered
a
dark
saying
of
which
the
future
was
to
solve
the
mystery,
wrote
some
prescriptions,
gave
some
directions
the
whole
with
an
air
of
crushing
authority
pocketed
his
fee,
and
went.
Probably
he
knew
well
enough
he
could
do
no
good,
but
didn't
like
to
say
so.
Still,
no
rumour
of
serious
illness
got
wind
in
the
neighbourhood.
At
Hollow's
Cottage
it
was
thought
that
Caroline
had
only
a
severe
cold,
she
having
written
a
note
to
Hortense
to
that
effect;
and
mademoiselle
contented
herself
with
sending
two
pots
of
currant
jam,
a
recipe
for
a
tisane,
and
a
note
of
advice.
Mrs.
Yorke
being
told
that
a
physician
had
been
