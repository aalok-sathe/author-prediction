heard
the
echo
of
his
own
deep
tones
in
the
girl's
voice,
that
modulated
itself
faithfully
on
his.
"Le
chene
et
le
Roseau,"
that
most
beautiful
of
La
Fontaine's
fables,
had
been
recited,
well
recited,
by
the
tutor,
and
the
pupil
had
animatedly
availed
herself
of
the
lesson.
Perhaps
a
simultaneous
feeling
seized
them
now,
that
their
enthusiasm
had
kindled
to
a
glow,
which
the
slight
fuel
of
French
poetry
no
longer
sufficed
to
feed;
perhaps
they
longed
for
a
trunk
of
English
oak
to
be
thrown
as
a
Yule
log
to
the
devouring
flame.
Moore
observed,
"And
these
are
our
best
pieces!
And
we
have
nothing
more
dramatic,
nervous,
natural!"
And
then
he
smiled
and
was
silent.
His
whole
nature
seemed
serenely
alight.
He
stood
on
the
hearth,
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece,
musing
not
unblissfully.
Twilight
was
closing
on
the
diminished
autumn
day.
The
schoolroom
windows
darkened
with
creeping
plants,
from
which
no
high
October
winds
had
as
yet
swept
the
sere
foliage
admitted
scarce
a
gleam
of
sky;
but
the
fire
gave
light
enough
to
talk
by.
And
now
Louis
Moore
addressed
his
pupil
in
French,
and
she
answered
at
first
with
laughing
hesitation
and
in
broken
phrase.
Moore
encouraged
while
he
corrected
her.
Henry
joined
in
the
lesson;
the
two
scholars
stood
opposite
the
master,
their
arms
round
each
other's
waists.
Tartar,
who
long
since
had
craved
and
obtained
admission,
sat
sagely
in
the
centre
of
the
rug,
staring
at
the
blaze
which
burst
fitful
from
morsels
of
coal
among
the
red
cinders.
The
group
were
happy
enough,
but
"Pleasures
are
like
poppies
spread;
You
seize
the
flower
its
bloom
is
shed."
The
dull,
rumbling
sound
of
wheels
was
heard
on
the
pavement
in
the
yard.
"It
is
the
carriage
returned,"
said
Shirley;
"and
dinner
must
be
just
ready,
and
I
am
not
dressed."
A
servant
came
in
with
Mr.
Moore's
candle
and
tea;
for
the
tutor
and
his
pupil
usually
dined
at
luncheon
time.
"Mr.
Sympson
and
the
ladies
are
returned,"
she
said,
"and
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
is
with
them."
"How
you
did
start,
and
how
your
hand
trembled,
Shirley!"
said
Henry,
when
the
maid
had
closed
the
shutter
and
was
gone.
"But
I
know
why
don't
you,
Mr.
Moore?
I
know
what
papa
intends.
He
is
a
little
ugly
man,
that
Sir
Philip.
I
wish
he
had
not
come.
I
wish
sisters
and
all
of
them
had
stayed
at
De
Walden
Hall
to
dine.
Shirley
should
once
more
have
made
tea
for
you
and
me,
Mr.
Moore,
and
we
would
have
had
a
happy
evening
of
it."
Moore
was
locking
up
his
desk
and
putting
away
his
St.
Pierre.
"That
was
your
plan,
was
it,
my
boy?"
"Don't
you
approve
it,
sir?"
"I
approve
nothing
utopian.
Look
Life
in
its
iron
face;
stare
Reality
out
of
its
brassy
countenance.
Make
the
tea,
Henry;
I
shall
be
back
in
a
minute."
He
left
the
room;
so
did
Shirley,
by
another
door.
Shirley
probably
got
