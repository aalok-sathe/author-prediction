seen
their
eyes
meet
once
only
once.
Some
natures
would
have
taken
pleasure
in
the
glance
then
surprised,
because
there
was
no
harm
and
some
delight
in
it.
It
was
by
no
means
a
glance
of
mutual
intelligence,
for
mutual
love
secrets
existed
not
between
them.
There
was
nothing
then
of
craft
and
concealment
to
offend:
only
Mr.
Moore's
eyes,
looking
into
Caroline's,
felt
they
were
clear
and
gentle;
and
Caroline's
eyes,
encountering
Mr.
Moore's,
confessed
they
were
manly
and
searching.
Each
acknowledged
the
charm
in
his
or
her
own
way.
Moore
smiled
slightly,
and
Caroline
coloured
as
slightly.
Mr.
Helstone
could,
on
the
spot,
have
rated
them
both.
They
annoyed
him.
Why?
Impossible
to
say.
If
you
had
asked
him
what
Moore
merited
at
that
moment,
he
would
have
said
a
"horsewhip;"
if
you
had
inquired
into
Caroline's
deserts,
he
would
have
adjudged
her
a
box
on
the
ear;
if
you
had
further
demanded
the
reason
of
such
chastisements,
he
would
have
stormed
against
flirtation
and
love
making,
and
vowed
he
would
have
no
such
folly
going
on
under
his
roof.
These
private
considerations,
combined
with
political
reasons,
fixed
his
resolution
of
separating
the
cousins.
He
announced
his
will
to
Caroline
one
evening
as
she
was
sitting
at
work
near
the
drawing
room
window.
Her
face
was
turned
towards
him,
and
the
light
fell
full
upon
it.
It
had
struck
him
a
few
minutes
before
that
she
was
looking
paler
and
quieter
than
she
used
to
look.
It
had
not
escaped
him
either
that
Robert
Moore's
name
had
never,
for
some
three
weeks
past,
dropped
from
her
lips;
nor
during
the
same
space
of
time
had
that
personage
made
his
appearance
at
the
rectory.
Some
suspicion
of
clandestine
meetings
haunted
his
mind.
Having
but
an
indifferent
opinion
of
women,
he
always
suspected
them.
He
thought
they
needed
constant
watching.
It
was
in
a
tone
dryly
significant
he
desired
her
to
cease
her
daily
visits
to
the
Hollow.
He
expected
a
start,
a
look
of
depreciation.
The
start
he
saw,
but
it
was
a
very
slight
one;
no
look
whatever
was
directed
to
him.
"Do
you
hear
me?"
he
asked.
"Yes,
uncle."
"Of
course
you
mean
to
attend
to
what
I
say?"
"Yes,
certainly."
"And
there
must
be
no
letter
scribbling
to
your
cousin
Hortense
no
intercourse
whatever.
I
do
not
approve
of
the
principles
of
the
family.
They
are
Jacobinical."
"Very
well,"
said
Caroline
quietly.
She
acquiesced
then.
There
was
no
vexed
flushing
of
the
face,
no
gathering
tears;
the
shadowy
thoughtfulness
which
had
covered
her
features
ere
Mr.
Helstone
spoke
remained
undisturbed;
she
was
obedient.
Yes,
perfectly;
because
the
mandate
coincided
with
her
own
previous
judgment;
because
it
was
now
become
pain
to
her
to
go
to
Hollow's
Cottage;
nothing
met
her
there
but
disappointment.
Hope
and
love
had
quitted
that
little
tenement,
for
Robert
seemed
to
have
deserted
its
precincts.
Whenever
she
asked
after
him
which
she
very
seldom
did,
since
the
mere
utterance
of
his
name
