ye.
And
that
day
ye
came
to
our
house,
and
called
me
to
t'
door,
and
offered
me
five
shillings,
which
I
doubt
ye
could
ill
spare
for
ye've
no
fortin',
I
know
that
day
I
war
fair
a
rebel,
a
radical,
an
insurrectionist;
and
ye
made
me
so.
I
thought
it
shameful
that,
willing
and
able
as
I
was
to
work,
I
suld
be
i'
such
a
condition
that
a
young
cratur
about
the
age
o'
my
own
eldest
lass
suld
think
it
needful
to
come
and
offer
me
her
bit
o'
brass."
"I
suppose
you
were
angry
with
me,
William?"
"I
almost
was,
in
a
way.
But
I
forgave
ye
varry
soon.
Ye
meant
well.
Ay,
I
am
proud,
and
so
are
ye;
but
your
pride
and
mine
is
t'
raight
mak
what
we
call
i'
Yorkshire
clean
pride
such
as
Mr.
Malone
and
Mr.
Donne
knows
nought
about.
Theirs
is
mucky
pride.
Now,
I
shall
teach
my
lasses
to
be
as
proud
as
Miss
Shirley
there,
and
my
lads
to
be
as
proud
as
myseln;
but
I
dare
ony
o'
'em
to
be
like
t'
curates.
I'd
lick
little
Michael
if
I
seed
him
show
any
signs
o'
that
feeling."
"What
is
the
difference,
William?"
"Ye
know
t'
difference
weel
enow,
but
ye
want
me
to
get
a
gate
o'
talking.
Mr.
Malone
and
Mr.
Donne
is
almost
too
proud
to
do
aught
for
theirseln;
we
are
almost
too
proud
to
let
anybody
do
aught
for
us.
T'
curates
can
hardly
bide
to
speak
a
civil
word
to
them
they
think
beneath
them;
we
can
hardly
bide
to
tak
an
uncivil
word
fro'
them
that
thinks
themseln
aboon
us."
"Now,
William,
be
humble
enough
to
tell
me
truly
how
you
are
getting
on
in
the
world.
Are
you
well
off?"
"Miss
Shirley,
I
am
varry
well
off.
Since
I
got
into
t'
gardening
line,
wi'
Mr.
Yorke's
help,
and
since
Mr.
Hall
(another
o'
t'
raight
sort)
helped
my
wife
to
set
up
a
bit
of
a
shop,
I've
nought
to
complain
of.
My
family
has
plenty
to
eat
and
plenty
to
wear.
My
pride
makes
me
find
means
to
have
an
odd
pound
now
and
then
against
rainy
days;
for
I
think
I'd
die
afore
I'd
come
to
t'
parish;
and
me
and
mine
is
content.
But
t'
neighbours
is
poor
yet.
I
see
a
great
deal
of
distress."
"And,
consequently,
there
is
still
discontent,
I
suppose?"
inquired
Miss
Keeldar.
"Consequently
ye
say
right
consequently.
In
course,
starving
folk
cannot
be
satisfied
or
settled
folk.
The
country's
not
in
a
safe
condition
I'll
say
so
mich!"
"But
what
can
be
done?
What
more
can
I
do,
for
instance?"
"Do?
Ye
can
do
not
mich,
poor
young
lass!
Ye've
gi'en
your
brass;
ye've
done
well.
If
ye
could
transport
your
tenant,
Mr.
Moore,
to
Botany
Bay,
ye'd
happen
do
better.
Folks
hate
him."
"William,
for
shame!"
exclaimed
Caroline
warmly.
"If
folks
do
hate
him,
it
is
to
