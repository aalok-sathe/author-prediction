near
Hollow's
Mill,
where
he
had
obtained
work),
entered
the
cottage,
and
having
greeted
the
good
wife
and
the
children,
sat
down.
He
proceeded
to
talk
very
cheerfully
about
the
length
of
time
that
had
elapsed
since
the
family
quitted
his
parish,
the
changes
which
had
occurred
since;
he
answered
questions
touching
his
sister
Margaret,
who
was
inquired
after
with
much
interest;
he
asked
questions
in
his
turn,
and
at
last,
glancing
hastily
and
anxiously
round
through
his
spectacles
(he
wore
spectacles,
for
he
was
short
sighted)
at
the
bare
room,
and
at
the
meagre
and
wan
faces
of
the
circle
about
him
for
the
children
had
come
round
his
knee,
and
the
father
and
mother
stood
before
him
he
said
abruptly,
"And
how
are
you
all?
How
do
you
get
on?"
Mr.
Hall,
be
it
remarked,
though
an
accomplished
scholar,
not
only
spoke
with
a
strong
northern
accent,
but,
on
occasion,
used
freely
north
country
expressions.
"We
get
on
poorly,"
said
William;
"we're
all
out
of
work.
I've
selled
most
o'
t'
household
stuff,
as
ye
may
see;
and
what
we're
to
do
next,
God
knows."
"Has
Mr.
Moore
turned
you
off?"
"He
has
turned
us
off;
and
I've
sich
an
opinion
of
him
now
that
I
think
if
he'd
tak
me
on
again
to
morrow
I
wouldn't
work
for
him."
"It
is
not
like
you
to
say
so,
William."
"I
know
it
isn't;
but
I'm
getting
different
to
mysel';
I
feel
I
am
changing.
I
wadn't
heed
if
t'
bairns
and
t'
wife
had
enough
to
live
on;
but
they're
pinched
they're
pined
"
"Well,
my
lad,
and
so
are
you;
I
see
you
are.
These
are
grievous
times;
I
see
suffering
wherever
I
turn.
William,
sit
down.
Grace,
sit
down.
Let
us
talk
it
over."
And
in
order
the
better
to
talk
it
over,
Mr.
Hall
lifted
the
least
of
the
children
on
to
his
knee,
and
placed
his
hand
on
the
head
of
the
next
least;
but
when
the
small
things
began
to
chatter
to
him
he
bade
them
"Whisht!"
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
grate,
he
regarded
the
handful
of
embers
which
burned
there
very
gravely.
"Sad
times,"
he
said,
"and
they
last
long.
It
is
the
will
of
God.
His
will
be
done.
But
He
tries
us
to
the
utmost."
Again
he
reflected.
"You've
no
money,
William,
and
you've
nothing
you
could
sell
to
raise
a
small
sum?"
"No.
I've
selled
t'
chest
o'
drawers,
and
t'
clock,
and
t'
bit
of
a
mahogany
stand,
and
t'
wife's
bonny
tea
tray
and
set
o'
cheeney
'at
she
brought
for
a
portion
when
we
were
wed."
"And
if
somebody
lent
you
a
pound
or
two,
could
you
make
any
good
use
of
it?
Could
you
get
into
a
new
way
of
doing
something?"
Farren
did
not
answer,
but
his
wife
said
quickly,
"Ay,
I'm
sure
he
could,
sir.
He's
a
very
contriving
chap
is
our
William.
If
he'd
two
or
three
pounds
he
could
