I've
heard
he's
an
honest
man,
but
am
I
to
support
all
the
honest
men
in
Yorkshire?
You
may
say
that
would
be
no
great
charge
to
undertake;
but
great
or
little,
I'll
none
of
it."
"Come,
Mr.
Yorke,
what
can
you
find
for
him
to
do?"
"I
find!
You'll
make
me
use
language
I'm
not
accustomed
to
use.
I
wish
you
would
go
home.
Here
is
the
door;
set
off."
Moore
sat
down
on
one
of
the
hall
chairs.
"You
can't
give
him
work
in
your
mill
good;
but
you
have
land.
Find
him
some
occupation
on
your
land,
Mr.
Yorke."
"Bob,
I
thought
you
cared
nothing
about
our
lourdauds
de
paysans.
I
don't
understand
this
change."
"I
do.
The
fellow
spoke
to
me
nothing
but
truth
and
sense.
I
answered
him
just
as
roughly
as
I
did
the
rest,
who
jabbered
mere
gibberish.
I
couldn't
make
distinctions
there
and
then.
His
appearance
told
what
he
had
gone
through
lately
clearer
than
his
words;
but
where
is
the
use
of
explaining?
Let
him
have
work."
"Let
him
have
it
yourself.
If
you
are
so
very
much
in
earnest,
strain
a
point."
"If
there
was
a
point
left
in
my
affairs
to
strain,
I
would
strain
it
till
it
cracked
again;
but
I
received
letters
this
morning
which
showed
me
pretty
clearly
where
I
stand,
and
it
is
not
far
off
the
end
of
the
plank.
My
foreign
market,
at
any
rate,
is
gorged.
If
there
is
no
change
if
there
dawns
no
prospect
of
peace
if
the
Orders
in
Council
are
not,
at
least,
suspended,
so
as
to
open
our
way
in
the
West
I
do
not
know
where
I
am
to
turn.
I
see
no
more
light
than
if
I
were
sealed
in
a
rock,
so
that
for
me
to
pretend
to
offer
a
man
a
livelihood
would
be
to
do
a
dishonest
thing."
"Come,
let
us
take
a
turn
on
the
front.
It
is
a
starlight
night,"
said
Mr.
Yorke.
They
passed
out,
closing
the
front
door
after
them,
and
side
by
side
paced
the
frost
white
pavement
to
and
fro.
"Settle
about
Farren
at
once,"
urged
Mr.
Moore.
"You
have
large
fruit
gardens
at
Yorke
Mills.
He
is
a
good
gardener.
Give
him
work
there."
"Well,
so
be
it.
I'll
send
for
him
to
morrow,
and
we'll
see.
And
now,
my
lad,
you're
concerned
about
the
condition
of
your
affairs?"
"Yes,
a
second
failure
which
I
may
delay,
but
which,
at
this
moment,
I
see
no
way
finally
to
avert
would
blight
the
name
of
Moore
completely;
and
you
are
aware
I
had
fine
intentions
of
paying
off
every
debt
and
re
establishing
the
old
firm
on
its
former
basis."
"You
want
capital
that's
all
you
want."
"Yes;
but
you
might
as
well
say
that
breath
is
all
a
dead
man
wants
to
live."
"I
know
I
know
capital
is
not
to
be
had
for
the
asking;
and
if
you
were
a
married
man,
and
had
