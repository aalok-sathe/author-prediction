rather
sit
up
a
little
longer,
if
you
do
not
object,
Shirley.
Here,"
she
continued,
"I
have
brought
the
brace
of
pistols
from
my
uncle's
study.
You
may
examine
them
at
your
leisure."
She
placed
them
on
the
table
before
her
friend.
"Why
would
you
rather
sit
up
longer?"
asked
Miss
Keeldar,
taking
up
the
firearms,
examining
them,
and
again
laying
them
down.
"Because
I
have
a
strange,
excited
feeling
in
my
heart."
"So
have
I."
"Is
this
state
of
sleeplessness
and
restlessness
caused
by
something
electrical
in
the
air,
I
wonder?"
"No;
the
sky
is
clear,
the
stars
numberless.
It
is
a
fine
night."
"But
very
still.
I
hear
the
water
fret
over
its
stony
bed
in
Hollow's
Copse
as
distinctly
as
if
it
ran
below
the
churchyard
wall."
"I
am
glad
it
is
so
still
a
night.
A
moaning
wind
or
rushing
rain
would
vex
me
to
fever
just
now."
"Why,
Shirley?"
"Because
it
would
baffle
my
efforts
to
listen."
"Do
you
listen
towards
the
Hollow?"
"Yes;
it
is
the
only
quarter
whence
we
can
hear
a
sound
just
now."
"The
only
one,
Shirley."
They
both
sat
near
the
window,
and
both
leaned
their
arms
on
the
sill,
and
both
inclined
their
heads
towards
the
open
lattice.
They
saw
each
other's
young
faces
by
the
starlight
and
that
dim
June
twilight
which
does
not
wholly
fade
from
the
west
till
dawn
begins
to
break
in
the
east.
"Mr.
Helstone
thinks
we
have
no
idea
which
way
he
is
gone,"
murmured
Miss
Keeldar,
"nor
on
what
errand,
nor
with
what
expectations,
nor
how
prepared.
But
I
guess
much;
do
not
you?"
"I
guess
something."
"All
those
gentlemen
your
cousin
Moore
included
think
that
you
and
I
are
now
asleep
in
our
beds,
unconscious."
"Caring
nothing
about
them
hoping
and
fearing
nothing
for
them,"
added
Caroline.
Both
kept
silent
for
full
half
an
hour.
The
night
was
silent
too;
only
the
church
clock
measured
its
course
by
quarters.
Some
words
were
interchanged
about
the
chill
of
the
air.
They
wrapped
their
scarves
closer
round
them,
resumed
their
bonnets,
which
they
had
removed,
and
again
watched.
Towards
midnight
the
teasing,
monotonous
bark
of
the
house
dog
disturbed
the
quietude
of
their
vigil.
Caroline
rose,
and
made
her
way
noiselessly
through
the
dark
passages
to
the
kitchen,
intending
to
appease
him
with
a
piece
of
bread.
She
succeeded.
On
returning
to
the
dining
room
she
found
it
all
dark,
Miss
Keeldar
having
extinguished
the
candle.
The
outline
of
her
shape
was
visible
near
the
still
open
window,
leaning
out.
Miss
Helstone
asked
no
questions;
she
stole
to
her
side.
The
dog
recommenced
barking
furiously.
Suddenly
he
stopped,
and
seemed
to
listen.
The
occupants
of
the
dining
room
listened
too,
and
not
merely
now
to
the
flow
of
the
mill
stream.
There
was
a
nearer,
though
a
muffled,
sound
on
the
road
below
the
churchyard
a
measured,
beating,
approaching
sound
a
dull
tramp
of
marching
feet.
It
drew
near.
Those
who
listened
by
