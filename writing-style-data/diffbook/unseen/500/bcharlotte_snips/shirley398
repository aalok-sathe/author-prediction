my
vocation
to
turn
out
a
new
variety
of
the
Yorke
species.
I
am
rather
tired
of
my
own
ancestors.
We
have
traditions
going
back
for
four
ages
tales
of
Hiram,
which
was
the
son
of
Hiram,
which
was
the
son
of
Samuel,
which
was
the
son
of
John,
which
was
the
son
of
Zerubbabel
Yorke.
All,
from
Zerubbabel
down
to
the
last
Hiram,
were
such
as
you
see
my
father.
Before
that
there
was
a
Godfrey.
We
have
his
picture;
it
hangs
in
Moore's
bedroom;
it
is
like
me.
Of
his
character
we
know
nothing;
but
I
am
sure
it
was
different
to
his
descendants.
He
has
long,
curling
dark
hair;
he
is
carefully
and
cavalierly
dressed.
Having
said
that
he
is
like
me,
I
need
not
add
that
he
is
handsome."
"You
are
not
handsome,
Martin."
"No;
but
wait
awhile
just
let
me
take
my
time.
I
mean
to
begin
from
this
day
to
cultivate,
to
polish,
and
we
shall
see."
"You
are
a
very
strange,
a
very
unaccountable
boy,
Martin.
But
don't
imagine
you
ever
will
be
handsome;
you
cannot."
"I
mean
to
try.
But
we
were
talking
about
Mrs.
Pryor.
She
must
be
the
most
unnatural
mamma
in
existence,
coolly
to
let
her
daughter
come
out
in
this
weather.
Mine
was
in
such
a
rage
because
I
would
go
to
church;
she
was
fit
to
fling
the
kitchen
brush
after
me."
"Mamma
was
very
much
concerned
about
me;
but
I
am
afraid
I
was
obstinate.
I
would
go."
"To
see
me?"
"Exactly;
I
thought
of
nothing
else.
I
greatly
feared
the
snow
would
hinder
you
from
coming.
You
don't
know
how
pleased
I
was
to
see
you
all
by
yourself
in
the
pew."
"I
came
to
fulfil
my
duty,
and
set
the
parish
a
good
example.
And
so
you
were
obstinate,
were
you?
I
should
like
to
see
you
obstinate,
I
should.
Wouldn't
I
have
you
in
good
discipline
if
I
owned
you?
Let
me
take
the
umbrella."
"I
can't
stay
two
minutes;
our
dinner
will
be
ready."
"And
so
will
ours;
and
we
have
always
a
hot
dinner
on
Sundays.
Roast
goose
to
day,
with
apple
pie
and
rice
pudding.
I
always
contrive
to
know
the
bill
of
fare.
Well,
I
like
these
things
uncommonly;
but
I'll
make
the
sacrifice,
if
you
will."
"We
have
a
cold
dinner.
My
uncle
will
allow
no
unnecessary
cooking
on
the
Sabbath.
But
I
must
return;
the
house
would
be
in
commotion
if
I
failed
to
appear."
"So
will
Briarmains,
bless
you!
I
think
I
hear
my
father
sending
out
the
overlooker
and
five
of
the
dyers,
to
look
in
six
directions
for
the
body
of
his
prodigal
son
in
the
snow;
and
my
mother
repenting
her
of
her
many
misdeeds
towards
me,
now
I
am
gone."
"Martin,
how
is
Mr.
Moore?"
"That
is
what
you
came
for,
just
to
say
that
word."
"Come,
tell
me
quickly."
"Hang
him!
he
is
no
worse;
but
as
ill
used
as
ever
