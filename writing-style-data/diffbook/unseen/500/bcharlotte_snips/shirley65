dangerous
waters,
sweeter
flowers,
more
tempting
fruits,
wider
plains,
drearier
deserts,
sunnier
fields
than
are
found
in
nature,
overspread
our
enchanted
globe.
What
a
moon
we
gaze
on
before
that
time!
How
the
trembling
of
our
hearts
at
her
aspect
bears
witness
to
its
unutterable
beauty!
As
to
our
sun,
it
is
a
burning
heaven
the
world
of
gods.
At
that
time,
at
eighteen,
drawing
near
the
confines
of
illusive,
void
dreams,
Elf
land
lies
behind
us,
the
shores
of
Reality
rise
in
front.
These
shores
are
yet
distant;
they
look
so
blue,
soft,
gentle,
we
long
to
reach
them.
In
sunshine
we
see
a
greenness
beneath
the
azure,
as
of
spring
meadows;
we
catch
glimpses
of
silver
lines,
and
imagine
the
roll
of
living
waters.
Could
we
but
reach
this
land,
we
think
to
hunger
and
thirst
no
more;
whereas
many
a
wilderness,
and
often
the
flood
of
death,
or
some
stream
of
sorrow
as
cold
and
almost
as
black
as
death,
is
to
be
crossed
ere
true
bliss
can
be
tasted.
Every
joy
that
life
gives
must
be
earned
ere
it
is
secured;
and
how
hardly
earned,
those
only
know
who
have
wrestled
for
great
prizes.
The
heart's
blood
must
gem
with
red
beads
the
brow
of
the
combatant,
before
the
wreath
of
victory
rustles
over
it.
At
eighteen
we
are
not
aware
of
this.
Hope,
when
she
smiles
on
us,
and
promises
happiness
to
morrow,
is
implicitly
believed;
Love,
when
he
comes
wandering
like
a
lost
angel
to
our
door,
is
at
once
admitted,
welcomed,
embraced.
His
quiver
is
not
seen;
if
his
arrows
penetrate,
their
wound
is
like
a
thrill
of
new
life.
There
are
no
fears
of
poison,
none
of
the
barb
which
no
leech's
hand
can
extract.
That
perilous
passion
an
agony
ever
in
some
of
its
phases;
with
many,
an
agony
throughout
is
believed
to
be
an
unqualified
good.
In
short,
at
eighteen
the
school
of
experience
is
to
be
entered,
and
her
humbling,
crushing,
grinding,
but
yet
purifying
and
invigorating
lessons
are
yet
to
be
learned.
Alas,
Experience!
No
other
mentor
has
so
wasted
and
frozen
a
face
as
yours,
none
wears
a
robe
so
black,
none
bears
a
rod
so
heavy,
none
with
hand
so
inexorable
draws
the
novice
so
sternly
to
his
task,
and
forces
him
with
authority
so
resistless
to
its
acquirement.
It
is
by
your
instructions
alone
that
man
or
woman
can
ever
find
a
safe
track
through
life's
wilds;
without
it,
how
they
stumble,
how
they
stray!
On
what
forbidden
grounds
do
they
intrude,
down
what
dread
declivities
are
they
hurled!
Caroline,
having
been
convoyed
home
by
Robert,
had
no
wish
to
pass
what
remained
of
the
evening
with
her
uncle.
The
room
in
which
he
sat
was
very
sacred
ground
to
her;
she
seldom
intruded
on
it;
and
to
night
she
kept
aloof
till
the
bell
rang
for
prayers.
Part
of
the
evening
church
service
was
the
form
of
worship
observed
in
Mr.
Helstone's
household.
