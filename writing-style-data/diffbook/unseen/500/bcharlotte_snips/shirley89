of
the
working
classes
no
longer;
he
had
considered
of
it,
and
made
up
his
mind
to
go
all
lengths;
if
money
and
spirit
could
put
down
these
rioters,
they
should
be
put
down;
Mr.
Moore
might
do
as
he
liked,
but
he
Christie
Sykes
would
spend
his
last
penny
in
law
before
he
would
be
beaten;
he'd
settle
them,
or
he'd
see.
"Take
another
glass,"
urged
Moore.
Mr.
Sykes
didn't
mind
if
he
did.
This
was
a
cold
morning
(Sugden
had
found
it
a
warm
one);
it
was
necessary
to
be
careful
at
this
season
of
the
year
it
was
proper
to
take
something
to
keep
the
damp
out;
he
had
a
little
cough
already
(here
he
coughed
in
attestation
of
the
fact);
something
of
this
sort
(lifting
the
black
bottle)
was
excellent,
taken
medicinally
(he
poured
the
physic
into
his
tumbler);
he
didn't
make
a
practice
of
drinking
spirits
in
a
morning,
but
occasionally
it
really
was
prudent
to
take
precautions.
"Quite
prudent,
and
take
them
by
all
means,"
urged
the
host.
Mr.
Sykes
now
addressed
Mr.
Helstone,
who
stood
on
the
hearth,
his
shovel
hat
on
his
head,
watching
him
significantly
with
his
little,
keen
eyes.
"You,
sir,
as
a
clergyman,"
said
he,
"may
feel
it
disagreeable
to
be
present
amidst
scenes
of
hurry
and
flurry,
and,
I
may
say,
peril.
I
dare
say
your
nerves
won't
stand
it.
You're
a
man
of
peace,
sir;
but
we
manufacturers,
living
in
the
world,
and
always
in
turmoil,
get
quite
belligerent.
Really,
there's
an
ardour
excited
by
the
thoughts
of
danger
that
makes
my
heart
pant.
When
Mrs.
Sykes
is
afraid
of
the
house
being
attacked
and
broke
open
as
she
is
every
night
I
get
quite
excited.
I
couldn't
describe
to
you,
sir,
my
feelings.
Really,
if
anybody
was
to
come
thieves
or
anything
I
believe
I
should
enjoy
it,
such
is
my
spirit."
The
hardest
of
laughs,
though
brief
and
low,
and
by
no
means
insulting,
was
the
response
of
the
rector.
Moore
would
have
pressed
upon
the
heroic
mill
owner
a
third
tumbler,
but
the
clergyman,
who
never
transgressed,
nor
would
suffer
others
in
his
presence
to
transgress,
the
bounds
of
decorum,
checked
him.
"Enough
is
as
good
as
a
feast,
is
it
not,
Mr.
Sykes?"
he
said;
and
Mr.
Sykes
assented,
and
then
sat
and
watched
Joe
Scott
remove
the
bottle
at
a
sign
from
Helstone,
with
a
self
satisfied
simper
on
his
lips
and
a
regretful
glisten
in
his
eye.
Moore
looked
as
if
he
should
have
liked
to
fool
him
to
the
top
of
his
bent.
What
would
a
certain
young
kinswoman
of
his
have
said
could
she
have
seen
her
dear,
good,
great
Robert
her
Coriolanus
just
now?
Would
she
have
acknowledged
in
that
mischievous,
sardonic
visage
the
same
face
to
which
she
had
looked
up
with
such
love,
which
had
bent
over
her
with
such
gentleness
last
night?
Was
that
the
man
who
had
spent
so
quiet
an
evening
with
his
