the
tropes
more
freshness,
the
inspiration
more
fire.
At
any
rate,
she
always
winced
when
he
recurred
to
the
subject
of
his
poems,
and
usually
did
her
best
to
divert
the
conversation
into
another
channel.
He
would
beguile
her
to
take
moonlight
walks
with
him
on
the
bridge,
for
the
sole
purpose,
as
it
seemed,
of
pouring
into
her
ear
the
longest
of
his
ballads.
He
would
lead
her
away
to
sequestered
rustic
seats,
whence
the
rush
of
the
surf
to
the
sands
was
heard
soft
and
soothing;
and
when
he
had
her
all
to
himself,
and
the
sea
lay
before
them,
and
the
scented
shade
of
gardens
spread
round,
and
the
tall
shelter
of
cliffs
rose
behind
them,
he
would
pull
out
his
last
batch
of
sonnets,
and
read
them
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
emotion.
He
did
not
seem
to
know
that
though
they
might
be
rhyme
they
were
not
poetry.
It
appeared,
by
Shirley's
downcast
eye
and
disturbed
face,
that
she
knew
it,
and
felt
heartily
mortified
by
the
single
foible
of
this
good
and
amiable
gentleman.
Often
she
tried,
as
gently
as
might
be,
to
wean
him
from
this
fanatic
worship
of
the
Muses.
It
was
his
monomania;
on
all
ordinary
subjects
he
was
sensible
enough,
and
fain
was
she
to
engage
him
in
ordinary
topics.
He
questioned
her
sometimes
about
his
place
at
Nunnely;
she
was
but
too
happy
to
answer
his
interrogatories
at
length.
She
never
wearied
of
describing
the
antique
priory,
the
wild
silvan
park,
the
hoary
church
and
hamlet;
nor
did
she
fail
to
counsel
him
to
come
down
and
gather
his
tenantry
about
him
in
his
ancestral
halls.
Somewhat
to
her
surprise,
Sir
Philip
followed
her
advice
to
the
letter,
and
actually,
towards
the
close
of
September,
arrived
at
the
priory.
He
soon
made
a
call
at
Fieldhead,
and
his
first
visit
was
not
his
last.
He
said
when
he
had
achieved
the
round
of
the
neighbourhood
that
under
no
roof
had
he
found
such
pleasant
shelter
as
beneath
the
massive
oak
beams
of
the
gray
manor
house
of
Briarfield;
a
cramped,
modest
dwelling
enough
compared
with
his
own,
but
he
liked
it.
Presently
it
did
not
suffice
to
sit
with
Shirley
in
her
panelled
parlour,
where
others
came
and
went,
and
where
he
could
rarely
find
a
quiet
moment
to
show
her
the
latest
production
of
his
fertile
muse;
he
must
have
her
out
amongst
the
pleasant
pastures,
and
lead
her
by
the
still
waters.
Tete
a
tete
ramblings
she
shunned,
so
he
made
parties
for
her
to
his
own
grounds,
his
glorious
forest;
to
remoter
scenes
woods
severed
by
the
Wharfe,
vales
watered
by
the
Aire.
Such
assiduity
covered
Miss
Keeldar
with
distinction.
Her
uncle's
prophetic
soul
anticipated
a
splendid
future.
He
already
scented
the
time
afar
off
when,
with
nonchalant
air,
and
left
foot
nursed
on
his
right
knee,
he
should
be
able
to
make
dashingly
familiar
allusion
to
his
"nephew
the
baronet."
Now
his
niece
dawned
upon
