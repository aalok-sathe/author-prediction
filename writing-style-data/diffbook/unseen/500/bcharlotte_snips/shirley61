science,
since
we
are
going
to
study?"
"It
appears
so."
"And
you
are
not
going
to
be
French,
and
sceptical,
and
sneering?
You
are
not
going
to
think
it
a
sign
of
wisdom
to
refuse
to
admire?"
"I
don't
know."
"If
you
do,
Robert,
I'll
take
Shakespeare
away;
and
I'll
shrivel
up
within
myself,
and
put
on
my
bonnet
and
go
home."
"Sit
down.
Here
I
begin."
"One
minute,
if
you
please,
brother,"
interrupted
mademoiselle.
"When
the
gentleman
of
a
family
reads,
the
ladies
should
always
sew.
Caroline,
dear
child,
take
your
embroidery.
You
may
get
three
sprigs
done
to
night."
Caroline
looked
dismayed.
"I
can't
see
by
lamp
light;
my
eyes
are
tired,
and
I
can't
do
two
things
well
at
once.
If
I
sew,
I
cannot
listen;
if
I
listen,
I
cannot
sew."
"Fi,
donc!
Quel
enfantillage!"
began
Hortense.
Mr.
Moore,
as
usual,
suavely
interposed.
"Permit
her
to
neglect
the
embroidery
for
this
evening.
I
wish
her
whole
attention
to
be
fixed
on
my
accent;
and
to
ensure
this,
she
must
follow
the
reading
with
her
eyes
she
must
look
at
the
book."
He
placed
it
between
them,
reposed
his
arm
on
the
back
of
Caroline's
chair,
and
thus
began
to
read.
The
very
first
scene
in
"Coriolanus"
came
with
smart
relish
to
his
intellectual
palate,
and
still
as
he
read
he
warmed.
He
delivered
the
haughty
speech
of
Caius
Marcius
to
the
starving
citizens
with
unction;
he
did
not
say
he
thought
his
irrational
pride
right,
but
he
seemed
to
feel
it
so.
Caroline
looked
up
at
him
with
a
singular
smile.
"There's
a
vicious
point
hit
already,"
she
said.
"You
sympathize
with
that
proud
patrician
who
does
not
sympathize
with
his
famished
fellow
men,
and
insults
them.
There,
go
on."
He
proceeded.
The
warlike
portions
did
not
rouse
him
much;
he
said
all
that
was
out
of
date,
or
should
be;
the
spirit
displayed
was
barbarous;
yet
the
encounter
single
handed
between
Marcius
and
Tullus
Aufidius
he
delighted
in.
As
he
advanced,
he
forgot
to
criticise;
it
was
evident
he
appreciated
the
power,
the
truth
of
each
portion;
and,
stepping
out
of
the
narrow
line
of
private
prejudices,
began
to
revel
in
the
large
picture
of
human
nature,
to
feel
the
reality
stamped
upon
the
characters
who
were
speaking
from
that
page
before
him.
He
did
not
read
the
comic
scenes
well;
and
Caroline,
taking
the
book
out
of
his
hand,
read
these
parts
for
him.
From
her
he
seemed
to
enjoy
them,
and
indeed
she
gave
them
with
a
spirit
no
one
could
have
expected
of
her,
with
a
pithy
expression
with
which
she
seemed
gifted
on
the
spot,
and
for
that
brief
moment
only.
It
may
be
remarked,
in
passing,
that
the
general
character
of
her
conversation
that
evening,
whether
serious
or
sprightly,
grave
or
gay,
was
as
of
something
untaught,
unstudied,
intuitive,
fitful
when
once
gone,
no
more
to
be
reproduced
as
it
had
been
than
the
glancing
ray
of
the
meteor,
than
