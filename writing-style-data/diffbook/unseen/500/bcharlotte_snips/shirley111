my
son?"
asked
the
father.
"Somewhere
where
I
shall
be
safe
from
insult,
if
in
this
house
I
can
find
any
such
place."
Matthew
laughed
very
insolently.
Martin
threw
a
strange
look
at
him,
and
trembled
through
all
his
slight
lad's
frame;
but
he
restrained
himself.
"I
suppose
there
is
no
objection
to
my
withdrawing?"
he
inquired.
"No.
Go,
my
lad;
but
remember
not
to
bear
malice."
Martin
went,
and
Matthew
sent
another
insolent
laugh
after
him.
Rose,
lifting
her
fair
head
from
Moore's
shoulder,
against
which,
for
a
moment,
it
had
been
resting,
said,
as
she
directed
a
steady
gaze
to
Matthew,
"Martin
is
grieved,
and
you
are
glad;
but
I
would
rather
be
Martin
than
you.
I
dislike
your
nature."
Here
Mr.
Moore,
by
way
of
averting,
or
at
least
escaping,
a
scene
which
a
sob
from
Mrs.
Yorke
warned
him
was
likely
to
come
on
rose,
and
putting
Jessy
off
his
knee,
he
kissed
her
and
Rose,
reminding
them,
at
the
same
time,
to
be
sure
and
come
to
the
Hollow
in
good
time
to
morrow
afternoon;
then,
having
taken
leave
of
his
hostess,
he
said
to
Mr.
Yorke,
"May
I
speak
a
word
with
you?"
and
was
followed
by
him
from
the
room.
Their
brief
conference
took
place
in
the
hall.
"Have
you
employment
for
a
good
workman?"
asked
Moore.
"A
nonsense
question
in
these
times,
when
you
know
that
every
master
has
many
good
workmen
to
whom
he
cannot
give
full
employment."
"You
must
oblige
me
by
taking
on
this
man,
if
possible."
"My
lad,
I
can
take
on
no
more
hands
to
oblige
all
England."
"It
does
not
signify;
I
must
find
him
a
place
somewhere."
"Who
is
he?"
"William
Farren."
"I
know
William.
A
right
down
honest
man
is
William."
"He
has
been
out
of
work
three
months.
He
has
a
large
family.
We
are
sure
they
cannot
live
without
wages.
He
was
one
of
the
deputation
of
cloth
dressers
who
came
to
me
this
morning
to
complain
and
threaten.
William
did
not
threaten.
He
only
asked
me
to
give
them
rather
more
time
to
make
my
changes
more
slowly.
You
know
I
cannot
do
that:
straitened
on
all
sides
as
I
am,
I
have
nothing
for
it
but
to
push
on.
I
thought
it
would
be
idle
to
palaver
long
with
them.
I
sent
them
away,
after
arresting
a
rascal
amongst
them,
whom
I
hope
to
transport
a
fellow
who
preaches
at
the
chapel
yonder
sometimes."
"Not
Moses
Barraclough?"
"Yes."
"Ah!
you've
arrested
him?
Good!
Then
out
of
a
scoundrel
you're
going
to
make
a
martyr.
You've
done
a
wise
thing."
"I've
done
a
right
thing.
Well,
the
short
and
the
long
of
it
is,
I'm
determined
to
get
Farren
a
place,
and
I
reckon
on
you
to
give
him
one."
"This
is
cool,
however!"
exclaimed
Mr.
Yorke.
"What
right
have
you
to
reckon
on
me
to
provide
for
your
dismissed
workmen?
What
do
I
know
about
your
Farrens
and
your
Williams?
