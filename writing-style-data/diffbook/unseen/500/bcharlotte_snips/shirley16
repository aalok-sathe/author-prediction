mill.
Sometimes
I
am
my
own
watchman.
I
require
little
sleep,
and
it
pleases
me
on
a
fine
night
to
wander
for
an
hour
or
two
with
my
musket
about
the
hollow.
Mr.
Malone,
can
you
cook
a
mutton
chop?"
"Try
me.
I've
done
it
hundreds
of
times
at
college."
"There's
a
dishful,
then,
and
there's
the
gridiron.
Turn
them
quickly.
You
know
the
secret
of
keeping
the
juices
in?"
"Never
fear
me;
you
shall
see.
Hand
a
knife
and
fork,
please."
The
curate
turned
up
his
coat
cuffs,
and
applied
himself
to
the
cookery
with
vigour.
The
manufacturer
placed
on
the
table
plates,
a
loaf
of
bread,
a
black
bottle,
and
two
tumblers.
He
then
produced
a
small
copper
kettle
still
from
the
same
well
stored
recess,
his
cupboard
filled
it
with
water
from
a
large
stone
jar
in
a
corner,
set
it
on
the
fire
beside
the
hissing
gridiron,
got
lemons,
sugar,
and
a
small
china
punch
bowl;
but
while
he
was
brewing
the
punch
a
tap
at
the
door
called
him
away.
"Is
it
you,
Sarah?"
"Yes,
sir.
Will
you
come
to
supper,
please,
sir?"
"No;
I
shall
not
be
in
to
night;
I
shall
sleep
in
the
mill.
So
lock
the
doors,
and
tell
your
mistress
to
go
to
bed."
He
returned.
"You
have
your
household
in
proper
order,"
observed
Malone
approvingly,
as,
with
his
fine
face
ruddy
as
the
embers
over
which
he
bent,
he
assiduously
turned
the
mutton
chops.
"You
are
not
under
petticoat
government,
like
poor
Sweeting,
a
man
whew!
how
the
fat
spits!
it
has
burnt
my
hand
destined
to
be
ruled
by
women.
Now
you
and
I,
Moore
there's
a
fine
brown
one
for
you,
and
full
of
gravy
you
and
I
will
have
no
gray
mares
in
our
stables
when
we
marry."
"I
don't
know;
I
never
think
about
it.
If
the
gray
mare
is
handsome
and
tractable,
why
not?"
"The
chops
are
done.
Is
the
punch
brewed?"
"There
is
a
glassful.
Taste
it.
When
Joe
Scott
and
his
minions
return
they
shall
have
a
share
of
this,
provided
they
bring
home
the
frames
intact."
Malone
waxed
very
exultant
over
the
supper.
He
laughed
aloud
at
trifles,
made
bad
jokes
and
applauded
them
himself,
and,
in
short,
grew
unmeaningly
noisy.
His
host,
on
the
contrary,
remained
quiet
as
before.
It
is
time,
reader,
that
you
should
have
some
idea
of
the
appearance
of
this
same
host.
I
must
endeavour
to
sketch
him
as
he
sits
at
table.
He
is
what
you
would
probably
call,
at
first
view,
rather
a
strange
looking
man;
for
he
is
thin,
dark,
sallow,
very
foreign
of
aspect,
with
shadowy
hair
carelessly
streaking
his
forehead.
It
appears
that
he
spends
but
little
time
at
his
toilet,
or
he
would
arrange
it
with
more
taste.
He
seems
unconscious
that
his
features
are
fine,
that
they
have
a
southern
symmetry,
clearness,
regularity
in
their
chiselling;
nor
does
a
spectator
become
aware
of
this
advantage
till
he
has
examined
