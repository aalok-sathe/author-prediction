Donne.
I
hope
you
won't
take
any
harm."
"That
I
shall,
no
doubt.
He
gave
me
a
turn
I
shall
not
soon
forget.
When
I
sor
him"
(such
was
Mr.
Donne's
pronunciation)
"about
to
spring,
I
thought
I
should
have
fainted."
"Perhaps
you
did
faint
in
the
bedroom;
you
were
a
long
time
there."
"No;
I
bore
up
that
I
might
hold
the
door
fast.
I
was
determined
not
to
let
any
one
enter.
I
thought
I
would
keep
a
barrier
between
me
and
the
enemy."
"But
what
if
your
friend
Mr.
Malone
had
been
worried?"
"Malone
must
take
care
of
himself.
Your
man
persuaded
me
to
come
out
at
last
by
saying
the
dog
was
chained
up
in
his
kennel.
If
I
had
not
been
assured
of
this,
I
would
have
remained
all
day
in
the
chamber.
But
what
is
that?
I
declare
the
man
has
told
a
falsehood!
The
dog
is
there!"
And
indeed
Tartar
walked
past
the
glass
door
opening
to
the
garden,
stiff,
tawny,
and
black
muzzled
as
ever.
He
still
seemed
in
bad
humour.
He
was
growling
again,
and
whistling
a
half
strangled
whistle,
being
an
inheritance
from
the
bulldog
side
of
his
ancestry.
"There
are
other
visitors
coming,"
observed
Shirley,
with
that
provoking
coolness
which
the
owners
of
formidable
looking
dogs
are
apt
to
show
while
their
animals
are
all
bristle
and
bay.
Tartar
sprang
down
the
pavement
towards
the
gate,
bellowing
avec
explosion.
His
mistress
quietly
opened
the
glass
door,
and
stepped
out
chirruping
to
him.
His
bellow
was
already
silenced,
and
he
was
lifting
up
his
huge,
blunt,
stupid
head
to
the
new
callers
to
be
patted.
"What!
Tartar,
Tartar!"
said
a
cheery,
rather
boyish
voice,
"don't
you
know
us?
Good
morning,
old
boy!"
And
little
Mr.
Sweeting,
whose
conscious
good
nature
made
him
comparatively
fearless
of
man,
woman,
child,
or
brute,
came
through
the
gate,
caressing
the
guardian.
His
vicar,
Mr.
Hall,
followed.
He
had
no
fear
of
Tartar
either,
and
Tartar
had
no
ill
will
to
him.
He
snuffed
both
the
gentlemen
round,
and
then,
as
if
concluding
that
they
were
harmless,
and
might
be
allowed
to
pass,
he
withdrew
to
the
sunny
front
of
the
hall,
leaving
the
archway
free.
Mr.
Sweeting
followed,
and
would
have
played
with
him;
but
Tartar
took
no
notice
of
his
caresses.
It
was
only
his
mistress's
hand
whose
touch
gave
him
pleasure;
to
all
others
he
showed
himself
obstinately
insensible.
Shirley
advanced
to
meet
Messrs.
Hall
and
Sweeting,
shaking
hands
with
them
cordially.
They
were
come
to
tell
her
of
certain
successes
they
had
achieved
that
morning
in
applications
for
subscriptions
to
the
fund.
Mr.
Hall's
eyes
beamed
benignantly
through
his
spectacles,
his
plain
face
looked
positively
handsome
with
goodness;
and
when
Caroline,
seeing
who
was
come,
ran
out
to
meet
him,
and
put
both
her
hands
into
his,
he
gazed
down
on
her
with
a
gentle,
serene,
affectionate
expression
that
gave
him
the
aspect
of
a
smiling
Melanchthon.
Instead
of
re
entering
