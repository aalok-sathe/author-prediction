softened
her
eye.
She
raised
her
hand
to
her
chin,
cast
her
gaze
down,
and
seemed
to
think
as
she
waited.
The
servant
announced
Mr.
Moore,
and
Shirley
turned
round
when
Mr.
Moore
appeared
at
the
door.
His
figure
seemed
very
tall
as
he
entered,
and
stood
in
contrast
with
the
three
ladies,
none
of
whom
could
boast
a
stature
much
beyond
the
average.
He
was
looking
well,
better
than
he
had
been
known
to
look
for
the
past
twelve
months.
A
sort
of
renewed
youth
glowed
in
his
eye
and
colour,
and
an
invigorated
hope
and
settled
purpose
sustained
his
bearing.
Firmness
his
countenance
still
indicated,
but
not
austerity.
It
looked
as
cheerful
as
it
was
earnest.
"I
am
just
returned
from
Stilbro',"
he
said
to
Miss
Keeldar,
as
he
greeted
her;
"and
I
thought
I
would
call
to
impart
to
you
the
result
of
my
mission."
"You
did
right
not
to
keep
me
in
suspense,"
she
said,
"and
your
visit
is
well
timed.
Sit
down.
We
have
not
finished
tea.
Are
you
English
enough
to
relish
tea,
or
do
you
faithfully
adhere
to
coffee?"
Moore
accepted
tea.
"I
am
learning
to
be
a
naturalized
Englishman,"
said
he;
"my
foreign
habits
are
leaving
me
one
by
one."
And
now
he
paid
his
respects
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
and
paid
them
well,
with
a
grave
modesty
that
became
his
age
compared
with
hers.
Then
he
looked
at
Caroline
not,
however,
for
the
first
time:
his
glance
had
fallen
upon
her
before.
He
bent
towards
her
as
she
sat,
gave
her
his
hand,
and
asked
her
how
she
was.
The
light
from
the
window
did
not
fall
upon
Miss
Helstone;
her
back
was
turned
towards
it.
A
quiet
though
rather
low
reply,
a
still
demeanour,
and
the
friendly
protection
of
early
twilight
kept
out
of
view
each
traitorous
symptom.
None
could
affirm
that
she
had
trembled
or
blushed,
that
her
heart
had
quaked
or
her
nerves
thrilled;
none
could
prove
emotion;
a
greeting
showing
less
effusion
was
never
interchanged.
Moore
took
the
empty
chair
near
her,
opposite
Miss
Keeldar.
He
had
placed
himself
well.
His
neighbour,
screened
by
the
very
closeness
of
his
vicinage
from
his
scrutiny,
and
sheltered
further
by
the
dusk
which
deepened
each
moment,
soon
regained
not
merely
seeming
but
real
mastery
of
the
feelings
which
had
started
into
insurrection
at
the
first
announcement
of
his
name.
He
addressed
his
conversation
to
Miss
Keeldar.
"I
went
to
the
barracks,"
he
said,
"and
had
an
interview
with
Colonel
Ryde.
He
approved
my
plans,
and
promised
the
aid
I
wanted.
Indeed,
he
offered
a
more
numerous
force
than
I
require
half
a
dozen
will
suffice.
I
don't
intend
to
be
swamped
by
redcoats.
They
are
needed
for
appearance
rather
than
anything
else.
My
main
reliance
is
on
my
own
civilians."
"And
on
their
captain,"
interposed
Shirley.
"What,
Captain
Keeldar?"
inquired
Moore,
slightly
smiling,
and
not
lifting
his
eyes.
The
tone
of
raillery
in
which
he
said
this
was
very
respectful
and
