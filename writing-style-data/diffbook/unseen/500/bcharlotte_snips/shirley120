she
was
now
declining
she
said
to
herself,
"I
have
to
live,
perhaps,
till
seventy
years.
As
far
as
I
know,
I
have
good
health;
half
a
century
of
existence
may
lie
before
me.
How
am
I
to
occupy
it?
What
am
I
to
do
to
fill
the
interval
of
time
which
spreads
between
me
and
the
grave?"
She
reflected.
"I
shall
not
be
married,
it
appears,"
she
continued.
"I
suppose,
as
Robert
does
not
care
for
me,
I
shall
never
have
a
husband
to
love,
nor
little
children
to
take
care
of.
Till
lately
I
had
reckoned
securely
on
the
duties
and
affections
of
wife
and
mother
to
occupy
my
existence.
I
considered,
somehow,
as
a
matter
of
course,
that
I
was
growing
up
to
the
ordinary
destiny,
and
never
troubled
myself
to
seek
any
other;
but
now
I
perceive
plainly
I
may
have
been
mistaken.
Probably
I
shall
be
an
old
maid.
I
shall
live
to
see
Robert
married
to
some
one
else,
some
rich
lady.
I
shall
never
marry.
What
was
I
created
for,
I
wonder?
Where
is
my
place
in
the
world?"
She
mused
again.
"Ah!
I
see,"
she
pursued
presently;
"that
is
the
question
which
most
old
maids
are
puzzled
to
solve.
Other
people
solve
it
for
them
by
saying,
'Your
place
is
to
do
good
to
others,
to
be
helpful
whenever
help
is
wanted.'
That
is
right
in
some
measure,
and
a
very
convenient
doctrine
for
the
people
who
hold
it;
but
I
perceive
that
certain
sets
of
human
beings
are
very
apt
to
maintain
that
other
sets
should
give
up
their
lives
to
them
and
their
service,
and
then
they
requite
them
by
praise;
they
call
them
devoted
and
virtuous.
Is
this
enough?
Is
it
to
live?
Is
there
not
a
terrible
hollowness,
mockery,
want,
craving,
in
that
existence
which
is
given
away
to
others,
for
want
of
something
of
your
own
to
bestow
it
on?
I
suspect
there
is.
Does
virtue
lie
in
abnegation
of
self?
I
do
not
believe
it.
Undue
humility
makes
tyranny;
weak
concession
creates
selfishness.
The
Romish
religion
especially
teaches
renunciation
of
self,
submission
to
others,
and
nowhere
are
found
so
many
grasping
tyrants
as
in
the
ranks
of
the
Romish
priesthood.
Each
human
being
has
his
share
of
rights.
I
suspect
it
would
conduce
to
the
happiness
and
welfare
of
all
if
each
knew
his
allotment,
and
held
to
it
as
tenaciously
as
the
martyr
to
his
creed.
Queer
thoughts
these
that
surge
in
my
mind.
Are
they
right
thoughts?
I
am
not
certain.
"Well,
life
is
short
at
the
best.
Seventy
years,
they
say,
pass
like
a
vapour,
like
a
dream
when
one
awaketh;
and
every
path
trod
by
human
feet
terminates
in
one
bourne
the
grave,
the
little
chink
in
the
surface
of
this
great
globe,
the
furrow
where
the
mighty
husbandman
with
the
scythe
deposits
the
seed
he
has
shaken
from
the
ripe
stem;
and
there
it
falls,
decays,
and
thence
it
springs
again,
