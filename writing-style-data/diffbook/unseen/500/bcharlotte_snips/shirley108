joined
in
this
time.
"You
see
in
what
esteem
you
are
held
behind
your
back,"
said
she;
"yet
I
believe
that
Miss
Pearson
would
like
to
catch
you.
She
set
her
cap
at
you
when
you
first
came
into
the
country,
old
as
she
is."
"And
who
contradicted
her,
Rosy?"
inquired
Moore.
"A
lady
whom
I
don't
know,
because
she
never
visits
here,
though
I
see
her
every
Sunday
at
church.
She
sits
in
the
pew
near
the
pulpit.
I
generally
look
at
her,
instead
of
looking
at
my
prayer
book,
for
she
is
like
a
picture
in
our
dining
room,
that
woman
with
the
dove
in
her
hand
at
least
she
has
eyes
like
it,
and
a
nose
too,
a
straight
nose,
that
makes
all
her
face
look,
somehow,
what
I
call
clear."
"And
you
don't
know
her!"
exclaimed
Jessy,
in
a
tone
of
exceeding
surprise.
"That's
so
like
Rose.
Mr.
Moore,
I
often
wonder
in
what
sort
of
a
world
my
sister
lives.
I
am
sure
she
does
not
live
all
her
time
in
this.
One
is
continually
finding
out
that
she
is
quite
ignorant
of
some
little
matter
which
everybody
else
knows.
To
think
of
her
going
solemnly
to
church
every
Sunday,
and
looking
all
service
time
at
one
particular
person,
and
never
so
much
as
asking
that
person's
name.
She
means
Caroline
Helstone,
the
rector's
niece.
I
remember
all
about
it.
Miss
Helstone
was
quite
angry
with
Anne
Pearson.
She
said,
'Robert
Moore
is
neither
affected
nor
sentimental;
you
mistake
his
character
utterly,
or
rather
not
one
of
you
here
knows
anything
about
it.'
Now,
shall
I
tell
you
what
she
is
like?
I
can
tell
what
people
are
like,
and
how
they
are
dressed,
better
than
Rose
can."
"Let
us
hear."
"She
is
nice;
she
is
fair;
she
has
a
pretty
white
slender
throat;
she
has
long
curls,
not
stiff
ones
they
hang
loose
and
soft,
their
colour
is
brown
but
not
dark;
she
speaks
quietly,
with
a
clear
tone;
she
never
makes
a
bustle
in
moving;
she
often
wears
a
gray
silk
dress;
she
is
neat
all
over
her
gowns,
and
her
shoes,
and
her
gloves
always
fit
her.
She
is
what
I
call
a
lady,
and
when
I
am
as
tall
as
she
is,
I
mean
to
be
like
her.
Shall
I
suit
you
if
I
am?
Will
you
really
marry
me?"
Moore
stroked
Jessy's
hair.
For
a
minute
he
seemed
as
if
he
would
draw
her
nearer
to
him,
but
instead
he
put
her
a
little
farther
off.
"Oh!
you
won't
have
me?
You
push
me
away."
"Why,
Jessy,
you
care
nothing
about
me.
You
never
come
to
see
me
now
at
the
Hollow."
"Because
you
don't
ask
me."
Hereupon
Mr.
Moore
gave
both
the
little
girls
an
invitation
to
pay
him
a
visit
next
day,
promising
that,
as
he
was
going
to
Stilbro'
in
the
morning,
he
would
buy
them
each
a
present,
of
what
nature
he
would
not
then
declare,
