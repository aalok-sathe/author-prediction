the
name
of
Robert
Moore;
an
elegy
over
the
past
still
rung
constantly
in
her
ear;
a
funereal
inward
cry
haunted
and
harassed
her;
the
heaviness
of
a
broken
spirit,
and
of
pining
and
palsying
faculties,
settled
slow
on
her
buoyant
youth.
Winter
seemed
conquering
her
spring;
the
mind's
soil
and
its
treasures
were
freezing
gradually
to
barren
stagnation.
Yet
Caroline
refused
tamely
to
succumb.
She
had
native
strength
in
her
girl's
heart,
and
she
used
it.
Men
and
women
never
struggle
so
hard
as
when
they
struggle
alone,
without
witness,
counsellor,
or
confidant,
unencouraged,
unadvised,
and
unpitied.
Miss
Helstone
was
in
this
position.
Her
sufferings
were
her
only
spur,
and
being
very
real
and
sharp,
they
roused
her
spirit
keenly.
Bent
on
victory
over
a
mortal
pain,
she
did
her
best
to
quell
it.
Never
had
she
been
seen
so
busy,
so
studious,
and,
above
all,
so
active.
She
took
walks
in
all
weathers,
long
walks
in
solitary
directions.
Day
by
day
she
came
back
in
the
evening,
pale
and
wearied
looking,
yet
seemingly
not
fatigued;
for
still,
as
soon
as
she
had
thrown
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl,
she
would,
instead
of
resting,
begin
to
pace
her
apartment.
Sometimes
she
would
not
sit
down
till
she
was
literally
faint.
She
said
she
did
this
to
tire
herself
well,
that
she
might
sleep
soundly
at
night.
But
if
that
was
her
aim
it
was
unattained;
for
at
night,
when
others
slumbered,
she
was
tossing
on
her
pillow,
or
sitting
at
the
foot
of
her
couch
in
the
darkness,
forgetful,
apparently,
of
the
necessity
of
seeking
repose.
Often,
unhappy
girl!
she
was
crying
crying
in
a
sort
of
intolerable
despair,
which,
when
it
rushed
over
her,
smote
down
her
strength,
and
reduced
her
to
childlike
helplessness.
When
thus
prostrate,
temptations
besieged
her.
Weak
suggestions
whispered
in
her
weary
heart
to
write
to
Robert,
and
say
that
she
was
unhappy
because
she
was
forbidden
to
see
him
and
Hortense,
and
that
she
feared
he
would
withdraw
his
friendship
(not
love)
from
her,
and
forget
her
entirely,
and
begging
him
to
remember
her,
and
sometimes
to
write
to
her.
One
or
two
such
letters
she
actually
indited,
but
she
never
sent
them:
shame
and
good
sense
forbade.
At
last
the
life
she
led
reached
the
point
when
it
seemed
she
could
bear
it
no
longer,
that
she
must
seek
and
find
a
change
somehow,
or
her
heart
and
head
would
fail
under
the
pressure
which
strained
them.
She
longed
to
leave
Briarfield,
to
go
to
some
very
distant
place.
She
longed
for
something
else
the
deep,
secret,
anxious
yearning
to
discover
and
know
her
mother
strengthened
daily;
but
with
the
desire
was
coupled
a
doubt,
a
dread
if
she
knew
her,
could
she
love
her?
There
was
cause
for
hesitation,
for
apprehension
on
this
point.
Never
in
her
life
had
she
heard
that
mother
praised;
whoever
mentioned
her
mentioned
her
coolly.
Her
uncle
seemed
to
regard
his
sister
in
law
with
a
