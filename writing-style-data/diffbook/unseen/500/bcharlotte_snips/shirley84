of
them
that
they
can
keep
a
stone
in
their
pocket
seven
years,
turn
it
at
the
end
of
that
time,
keep
it
seven
years
longer,
and
hurl
it
and
hit
their
mark
'at
last.'"
Moore
laughed.
"A
most
pithy
vaunt,"
said
he
"one
that
redounds
vastly
to
the
credit
of
your
dear
Yorkshire
friends.
But
don't
fear
for
me,
Lina.
I
am
on
my
guard
against
these
lamb
like
compatriots
of
yours.
Don't
make
yourself
uneasy
about
me."
"How
can
I
help
it?
You
are
my
cousin.
If
anything
happened
"
She
stopped.
"Nothing
will
happen,
Lina.
To
speak
in
your
own
language,
there
is
a
Providence
above
all
is
there
not?"
"Yes,
dear
Robert.
May
He
guard
you!"
"And
if
prayers
have
efficacy,
yours
will
benefit
me.
You
pray
for
me
sometimes?"
"Not
sometimes,
Robert.
You,
and
Louis,
and
Hortense
are
always
remembered."
"So
I
have
often
imagined.
It
has
occurred
to
me
when,
weary
and
vexed,
I
have
myself
gone
to
bed
like
a
heathen,
that
another
had
asked
forgiveness
for
my
day,
and
safety
for
my
night.
I
don't
suppose
such
vicarial
piety
will
avail
much,
but
the
petitions
come
out
of
a
sincere
breast,
from
innocent
lips.
They
should
be
acceptable
as
Abel's
offering;
and
doubtless
would
be,
if
the
object
deserved
them."
"Annihilate
that
doubt.
It
is
groundless."
"When
a
man
has
been
brought
up
only
to
make
money,
and
lives
to
make
it,
and
for
nothing
else,
and
scarcely
breathes
any
other
air
than
that
of
mills
and
markets,
it
seems
odd
to
utter
his
name
in
a
prayer,
or
to
mix
his
idea
with
anything
divine;
and
very
strange
it
seems
that
a
good,
pure
heart
should
take
him
in
and
harbour
him,
as
if
he
had
any
claim
to
that
sort
of
nest.
If
I
could
guide
that
benignant
heart,
I
believe
I
should
counsel
it
to
exclude
one
who
does
not
profess
to
have
any
higher
aim
in
life
than
that
of
patching
up
his
broken
fortune,
and
wiping
clean
from
his
bourgeois
scutcheon
the
foul
stain
of
bankruptcy."
The
hint,
though
conveyed
thus
tenderly
and
modestly
(as
Caroline
thought),
was
felt
keenly
and
comprehended
clearly.
"Indeed,
I
only
think
or
I
will
only
think
of
you
as
my
cousin,"
was
the
quick
answer.
"I
am
beginning
to
understand
things
better
than
I
did,
Robert,
when
you
first
came
to
England
better
than
I
did
a
week,
a
day
ago.
I
know
it
is
your
duty
to
try
to
get
on,
and
that
it
won't
do
for
you
to
be
romantic;
but
in
future
you
must
not
misunderstand
me
if
I
seem
friendly.
You
misunderstood
me
this
morning,
did
you
not?"
"What
made
you
think
so?"
"Your
look
your
manner."
"But
look
at
me
now
"
"Oh!
you
are
different
now.
At
present
I
dare
speak
to
you."
"Yet
I
am
the
same,
except
that
I
have
left
the
tradesman
behind
me
in
the
Hollow.
Your
kinsman
alone
stands
before
