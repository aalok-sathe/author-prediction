felt
annoyed
had
he
fondled
a
kitten
in
her
presence.
The
boys
were
standing
about
the
chaise
as
Moore
entered
it;
but
for
them
he
had
no
farewell.
To
Mr.
Yorke
he
only
said,
"You
have
a
good
riddance
of
me.
That
was
an
unlucky
shot
for
you,
Yorke;
it
turned
Briarmains
into
an
hospital.
Come
and
see
me
at
the
cottage
soon."
He
drew
up
the
glass;
the
chaise
rolled
away.
In
half
an
hour
he
alighted
at
his
own
garden
wicket.
Having
paid
the
driver
and
dismissed
the
vehicle,
he
leaned
on
that
wicket
an
instant,
at
once
to
rest
and
to
muse.
"Six
months
ago
I
passed
out
at
this
gate,"
said
he,
"a
proud,
angry,
disappointed
man.
I
come
back
sadder
and
wiser;
weakly
enough,
but
not
worried.
A
cold,
gray,
yet
quiet
world
lies
round
a
world
where,
if
I
hope
little,
I
fear
nothing.
All
slavish
terrors
of
embarrassment
have
left
me.
Let
the
worst
come,
I
can
work,
as
Joe
Scott
does,
for
an
honourable
living;
in
such
doom
I
yet
see
some
hardship
but
no
degradation.
Formerly,
pecuniary
ruin
was
equivalent
in
my
eyes
to
personal
dishonour.
It
is
not
so
now;
I
know
the
difference.
Ruin
is
an
evil,
but
one
for
which
I
am
prepared;
the
day
of
whose
coming
I
know,
for
I
have
calculated.
I
can
yet
put
it
off
six
months
not
an
hour
longer.
If
things
by
that
time
alter,
which
is
not
probable;
if
fetters,
which
now
seem
indissoluble,
should
be
loosened
from
our
trade
(of
all
things
the
most
unlikely
to
happen),
I
might
conquer
in
this
long
struggle
yet
I
might
good
God!
what
might
I
not
do?
But
the
thought
is
a
brief
madness;
let
me
see
things
with
sane
eyes.
Ruin
will
come,
lay
her
axe
to
my
fortune's
roots,
and
hew
them
down.
I
shall
snatch
a
sapling,
I
shall
cross
the
sea,
and
plant
it
in
American
woods.
Louis
will
go
with
me.
Will
none
but
Louis
go?
I
cannot
tell
I
have
no
right
to
ask."
He
entered
the
house.
It
was
afternoon,
twilight
yet
out
of
doors
starless
and
moonless
twilight;
for
though
keenly
freezing
with
a
dry,
black
frost,
heaven
wore
a
mask
of
clouds
congealed
and
fast
locked.
The
mill
dam
too
was
frozen.
The
Hollow
was
very
still.
Indoors
it
was
already
dark.
Sarah
had
lit
a
good
fire
in
the
parlour;
she
was
preparing
tea
in
the
kitchen.
"Hortense,"
said
Moore,
as
his
sister
bustled
up
to
help
him
off
with
his
cloak,
"I
am
pleased
to
come
home."
Hortense
did
not
feel
the
peculiar
novelty
of
this
expression
coming
from
her
brother,
who
had
never
before
called
the
cottage
his
home,
and
to
whom
its
narrow
limits
had
always
heretofore
seemed
rather
restrictive
than
protective.
Still,
whatever
contributed
to
his
happiness
pleased
her,
and
she
expressed
herself
to
that
effect.
He
sat
down,
but
soon
rose
again.
He
went
to
the
window;
