the
world.
They
took
a
similar
interest
in
animals,
birds,
insects,
and
plants;
they
held
similar
doctrines
about
humanity
to
the
lower
creation,
and
had
a
similar
turn
for
minute
observation
on
points
of
natural
history.
The
nest
and
proceedings
of
some
ground
bees,
which
had
burrowed
in
the
turf
under
an
old
cherry
tree,
was
one
subject
of
interest;
the
haunts
of
certain
hedge
sparrows,
and
the
welfare
of
certain
pearly
eggs
and
callow
fledglings,
another.
Had
Chambers's
Journal
existed
in
those
days,
it
would
certainly
have
formed
Miss
Helstone's
and
Farren's
favourite
periodical.
She
would
have
subscribed
for
it,
and
to
him
each
number
would
duly
have
been
lent;
both
would
have
put
implicit
faith
and
found
great
savour
in
its
marvellous
anecdotes
of
animal
sagacity.
This
is
a
digression,
but
it
suffices
to
explain
why
Caroline
would
have
no
other
hand
than
William's
to
guide
her
chair,
and
why
his
society
and
conversation
sufficed
to
give
interest
to
her
garden
airings.
Mrs.
Pryor,
walking
near,
wondered
how
her
daughter
could
be
so
much
at
ease
with
a
"man
of
the
people."
She
found
it
impossible
to
speak
to
him
otherwise
than
stiffly.
She
felt
as
if
a
great
gulf
lay
between
her
caste
and
his,
and
that
to
cross
it
or
meet
him
half
way
would
be
to
degrade
herself.
She
gently
asked
Caroline,
"Are
you
not
afraid,
my
dear,
to
converse
with
that
person
so
unreservedly?
He
may
presume,
and
become
troublesomely
garrulous."
"William
presume,
mamma?
You
don't
know
him.
He
never
presumes.
He
is
altogether
too
proud
and
sensitive
to
do
so.
William
has
very
fine
feelings."
And
Mrs.
Pryor
smiled
sceptically
at
the
naive
notion
of
that
rough
handed,
rough
headed,
fustian
clad
clown
having
"fine
feelings."
Farren,
for
his
part,
showed
Mrs.
Pryor
only
a
very
sulky
brow.
He
knew
when
he
was
misjudged,
and
was
apt
to
turn
unmanageable
with
such
as
failed
to
give
him
his
due.
The
evening
restored
Caroline
entirely
to
her
mother,
and
Mrs.
Pryor
liked
the
evening;
for
then,
alone
with
her
daughter,
no
human
shadow
came
between
her
and
what
she
loved.
During
the
day
she
would
have
her
stiff
demeanour
and
cool
moments,
as
was
her
wont.
Between
her
and
Mr.
Helstone
a
very
respectful
but
most
rigidly
ceremonious
intercourse
was
kept
up.
Anything
like
familiarity
would
have
bred
contempt
at
once
in
one
or
both
these
personages;
but
by
dint
of
strict
civility
and
well
maintained
distance
they
got
on
very
smoothly.
Towards
the
servants
Mrs.
Pryor's
bearing
was
not
uncourteous,
but
shy,
freezing,
ungenial.
Perhaps
it
was
diffidence
rather
than
pride
which
made
her
appear
so
haughty;
but,
as
was
to
be
expected,
Fanny
and
Eliza
failed
to
make
the
distinction,
and
she
was
unpopular
with
them
accordingly.
She
felt
the
effect
produced;
it
rendered
her
at
times
dissatisfied
with
herself
for
faults
she
could
not
help,
and
with
all
else
dejected,
chill,
and
taciturn.
This
mood
changed
to
Caroline's
influence,
and
to
