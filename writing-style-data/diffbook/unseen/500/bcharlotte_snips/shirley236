though
Shirley
put
off
their
too
late
arrival
with
a
jest,
and
was
ever
ready
to
satirize
her
own
or
any
other
person's
enthusiasm,
she
would
have
given
a
farm
of
her
best
land
for
a
chance
of
rendering
good
service.
The
chance
was
not
vouchsafed
her;
the
looked
for
juncture
never
came.
It
was
not
likely.
Moore
had
expected
this
attack
for
days,
perhaps
weeks;
he
was
prepared
for
it
at
every
point.
He
had
fortified
and
garrisoned
his
mill,
which
in
itself
was
a
strong
building.
He
was
a
cool,
brave
man;
he
stood
to
the
defence
with
unflinching
firmness.
Those
who
were
with
him
caught
his
spirit,
and
copied
his
demeanour.
The
rioters
had
never
been
so
met
before.
At
other
mills
they
had
attacked
they
had
found
no
resistance;
an
organized,
resolute
defence
was
what
they
never
dreamed
of
encountering.
When
their
leaders
saw
the
steady
fire
kept
up
from
the
mill,
witnessed
the
composure
and
determination
of
its
owner,
heard
themselves
coolly
defied
and
invited
on
to
death,
and
beheld
their
men
falling
wounded
round
them,
they
felt
that
nothing
was
to
be
done
here.
In
haste
they
mustered
their
forces,
drew
them
away
from
the
building.
A
roll
was
called
over,
in
which
the
men
answered
to
figures
instead
of
names.
They
dispersed
wide
over
the
fields,
leaving
silence
and
ruin
behind
them.
The
attack,
from
its
commencement
to
its
termination,
had
not
occupied
an
hour.
Day
was
by
this
time
approaching;
the
west
was
dim,
the
east
beginning
to
gleam.
It
would
have
seemed
that
the
girls
who
had
watched
this
conflict
would
now
wish
to
hasten
to
the
victors,
on
whose
side
all
their
interest
had
been
enlisted;
but
they
only
very
cautiously
approached
the
now
battered
mill,
and
when
suddenly
a
number
of
soldiers
and
gentlemen
appeared
at
the
great
door
opening
into
the
yard,
they
quickly
stepped
aside
into
a
shed,
the
deposit
of
old
iron
and
timber,
whence
they
could
see
without
being
seen.
It
was
no
cheering
spectacle.
These
premises
were
now
a
mere
blot
of
desolation
on
the
fresh
front
of
the
summer
dawn.
All
the
copse
up
the
Hollow
was
shady
and
dewy,
the
hill
at
its
head
was
green;
but
just
here,
in
the
centre
of
the
sweet
glen,
Discord,
broken
loose
in
the
night
from
control,
had
beaten
the
ground
with
his
stamping
hoofs,
and
left
it
waste
and
pulverized.
The
mill
yawned
all
ruinous
with
unglazed
frames;
the
yard
was
thickly
bestrewn
with
stones
and
brickbats;
and
close
under
the
mill,
with
the
glittering
fragments
of
the
shattered
windows,
muskets
and
other
weapons
lay
here
and
there.
More
than
one
deep
crimson
stain
was
visible
on
the
gravel,
a
human
body
lay
quiet
on
its
face
near
the
gates,
and
five
or
six
wounded
men
writhed
and
moaned
in
the
bloody
dust.
Miss
Keeldar's
countenance
changed
at
this
view.
It
was
the
after
taste
of
the
battle,
death
and
pain
replacing
excitement
and
