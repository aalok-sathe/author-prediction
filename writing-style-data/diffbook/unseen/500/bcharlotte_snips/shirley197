in
Yorkshire?
What
more
conclusive
proof
could
be
given
that
he
was
better
than
anything
there?
And
yet
here
was
he
about
to
be
turned
like
a
dog
out
of
a
Yorkshire
garden!
Where,
under
such
circumstances,
was
the
"concatenation
accordingly"?
"Rid
me
of
you
instantly
instantly!"
reiterated
Shirley,
as
he
lingered.
"Madam
a
clergyman!
turn
out
a
clergyman!"
"Off!
Were
you
an
archbishop
you
have
proved
yourself
no
gentleman,
and
must
go.
Quick!"
She
was
quite
resolved.
There
was
no
trifling
with
her.
Besides,
Tartar
was
again
rising;
he
perceived
symptoms
of
a
commotion;
he
manifested
a
disposition
to
join
in.
There
was
evidently
nothing
for
it
but
to
go,
and
Donne
made
his
exodus,
the
heiress
sweeping
him
a
deep
curtsy
as
she
closed
the
gates
on
him.
"How
dare
the
pompous
priest
abuse
his
flock!
How
dare
the
lisping
cockney
revile
Yorkshire!"
was
her
sole
observation
on
the
circumstance,
as
she
returned
to
the
table.
Ere
long
the
little
party
broke
up;
Miss
Keeldar's
ruffled
and
darkened
brow,
curled
lip,
and
incensed
eye
gave
no
invitation
to
further
social
enjoyment.
The
fund
prospered.
By
dint
of
Miss
Keeldar's
example,
the
three
rectors'
vigorous
exertions,
and
the
efficient
though
quiet
aid
of
their
spinster
and
spectacled
lieutenants,
Mary
Ann
Ainley
and
Margaret
Hall,
a
handsome
sum
was
raised;
and
this
being
judiciously
managed,
served
for
the
present
greatly
to
alleviate
the
distress
of
the
unemployed
poor.
The
neighbourhood
seemed
to
grow
calmer.
For
a
fortnight
past
no
cloth
had
been
destroyed;
no
outrage
on
mill
or
mansion
had
been
committed
in
the
three
parishes.
Shirley
was
sanguine
that
the
evil
she
wished
to
avert
was
almost
escaped,
that
the
threatened
storm
was
passing
over.
With
the
approach
of
summer
she
felt
certain
that
trade
would
improve
it
always
did;
and
then
this
weary
war
could
not
last
for
ever;
peace
must
return
one
day.
With
peace,
what
an
impulse
would
be
given
to
commerce!
Such
was
the
usual
tenor
of
her
observations
to
her
tenant,
Gerard
Moore,
whenever
she
met
him
where
they
could
converse;
and
Moore
would
listen
very
quietly
too
quietly
to
satisfy
her.
She
would
then
by
her
impatient
glance
demand
something
more
from
him
some
explanation,
or
at
least
some
additional
remark.
Smiling
in
his
way,
with
that
expression
which
gave
a
remarkable
cast
of
sweetness
to
his
mouth,
while
his
brow
remained
grave,
he
would
answer
to
the
effect
that
himself
too
trusted
in
the
finite
nature
of
the
war;
that
it
was
indeed
on
that
ground
the
anchor
of
his
hopes
was
fixed;
thereon
his
speculations
depended.
"For
you
are
aware,"
he
would
continue,
"that
I
now
work
Hollow's
Mill
entirely
on
speculation.
I
sell
nothing;
there
is
no
market
for
my
goods.
I
manufacture
for
a
future
day.
I
make
myself
ready
to
take
advantage
of
the
first
opening
that
shall
occur.
Three
months
ago
this
was
impossible
to
me;
I
had
exhausted
both
credit
and
capital.
You
well
know
who
