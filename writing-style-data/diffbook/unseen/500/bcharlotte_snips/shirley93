drunk
by
the
roadside,
as
I
returned
from
Stilbro'
market;
and
while
you
preach
peace,
you
make
it
the
business
of
your
life
to
stir
up
dissension.
You
no
more
sympathize
with
the
poor
who
are
in
distress
than
you
sympathize
with
me.
You
incite
them
to
outrage
for
bad
purposes
of
your
own;
so
does
the
individual
called
Noah
of
Tim's.
You
two
are
restless,
meddling,
impudent
scoundrels,
whose
chief
motive
principle
is
a
selfish
ambition,
as
dangerous
as
it
is
puerile.
The
persons
behind
you
are
some
of
them
honest
though
misguided
men;
but
you
two
I
count
altogether
bad."
Barraclough
was
going
to
speak.
"Silence!
You
have
had
your
say,
and
now
I
will
have
mine.
As
to
being
dictated
to
by
you,
or
any
Jack,
Jem,
or
Jonathan
on
earth,
I
shall
not
suffer
it
for
a
moment.
You
desire
me
to
quit
the
country;
you
request
me
to
part
with
my
machinery.
In
case
I
refuse,
you
threaten
me.
I
do
refuse
point
blank!
Here
I
stay,
and
by
this
mill
I
stand,
and
into
it
will
I
convey
the
best
machinery
inventors
can
furnish.
What
will
you
do?
The
utmost
you
can
do
and
this
you
will
never
dare
to
do
is
to
burn
down
my
mill,
destroy
its
contents,
and
shoot
me.
What
then?
Suppose
that
building
was
a
ruin
and
I
was
a
corpse
what
then,
you
lads
behind
these
two
scamps?
Would
that
stop
invention
or
exhaust
science?
Not
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
of
time!
Another
and
better
gig
mill
would
rise
on
the
ruins
of
this,
and
perhaps
a
more
enterprising
owner
come
in
my
place.
Hear
me!
I'll
make
my
cloth
as
I
please,
and
according
to
the
best
lights
I
have.
In
its
manufacture
I
will
employ
what
means
I
choose.
Whoever,
after
hearing
this,
shall
dare
to
interfere
with
me
may
just
take
the
consequences.
An
example
shall
prove
I'm
in
earnest."
He
whistled
shrill
and
loud.
Sugden,
his
staff
and
warrant,
came
on
the
scene.
Moore
turned
sharply
to
Barraclough.
"You
were
at
Stilbro',"
said
he;
"I
have
proof
of
that.
You
were
on
the
moor,
you
wore
a
mask,
you
knocked
down
one
of
my
men
with
your
own
hand
you!
a
preacher
of
the
gospel!
Sugden,
arrest
him!"
Moses
was
captured.
There
was
a
cry
and
a
rush
to
rescue,
but
the
right
hand
which
all
this
while
had
lain
hidden
in
Moore's
breast,
reappearing,
held
out
a
pistol.
"Both
barrels
are
loaded,"
said
he.
"I'm
quite
determined!
Keep
off!"
Stepping
backwards,
facing
the
foe
as
he
went,
he
guarded
his
prey
to
the
counting
house.
He
ordered
Joe
Scott
to
pass
in
with
Sugden
and
the
prisoner,
and
to
bolt
the
door
inside.
For
himself,
he
walked
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
front
of
the
mill,
looking
meditatively
on
the
ground,
his
hand
hanging
carelessly
by
his
side,
but
still
holding
the
pistol.
The
eleven
remaining
deputies
watched
him
some
time,
