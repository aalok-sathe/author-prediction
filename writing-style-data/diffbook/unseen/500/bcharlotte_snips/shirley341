Keeldar,
to
send
for
you
that
is,
to
ask
an
interview
of
a
few
minutes."
She
waited;
she
plied
her
needle.
"Well,
sir"
(not
lifting
her
eyes),
"what
about?"
"Be
seated
first.
The
subject
I
would
broach
is
one
of
some
moment.
Perhaps
I
have
hardly
a
right
to
approach
it.
It
is
possible
I
ought
to
frame
an
apology;
it
is
possible
no
apology
can
excuse
me.
The
liberty
I
have
taken
arises
from
a
conversation
with
Henry.
The
boy
is
unhappy
about
your
health;
all
your
friends
are
unhappy
on
that
subject.
It
is
of
your
health
I
would
speak."
"I
am
quite
well,"
she
said
briefly.
"Yet
changed."
"That
matters
to
none
but
myself.
We
all
change."
"Will
you
sit
down?
Formerly,
Miss
Keeldar,
I
had
some
influence
with
you:
have
I
any
now?
May
I
feel
that
what
I
am
saying
is
not
accounted
positive
presumption?"
"Let
me
read
some
French,
Mr.
Moore,
or
I
will
even
take
a
spell
at
the
Latin
grammar,
and
let
us
proclaim
a
truce
to
all
sanitary
discussions."
"No,
no.
It
is
time
there
were
discussions."
"Discuss
away,
then,
but
do
not
choose
me
for
your
text.
I
am
a
healthy
subject."
"Do
you
not
think
it
wrong
to
affirm
and
reaffirm
what
is
substantially
untrue?"
"I
say
I
am
well.
I
have
neither
cough,
pain,
nor
fever."
"Is
there
no
equivocation
in
that
assertion?
Is
it
the
direct
truth?"
"The
direct
truth."
Louis
Moore
looked
at
her
earnestly.
"I
can
myself,"
he
said,
"trace
no
indications
of
actual
disease.
But
why,
then,
are
you
altered?"
"Am
I
altered?"
"We
will
try.
We
will
seek
a
proof."
"How?"
"I
ask,
in
the
first
place,
do
you
sleep
as
you
used
to?"
"I
do
not;
but
it
is
not
because
I
am
ill."
"Have
you
the
appetite
you
once
had?"
"No;
but
it
is
not
because
I
am
ill."
"You
remember
this
little
ring
fastened
to
my
watch
chain?
It
was
my
mother's,
and
is
too
small
to
pass
the
joint
of
my
little
finger.
You
have
many
a
time
sportively
purloined
it.
It
fitted
your
fore
finger.
Try
now."
She
permitted
the
test.
The
ring
dropped
from
the
wasted
little
hand.
Louis
picked
it
up,
and
reattached
it
to
the
chain.
An
uneasy
flush
coloured
his
brow.
Shirley
again
said,
"It
is
not
because
I
am
ill."
"Not
only
have
you
lost
sleep,
appetite,
and
flesh,"
proceeded
Moore,
"but
your
spirits
are
always
at
ebb.
Besides,
there
is
a
nervous
alarm
in
your
eye,
a
nervous
disquiet
in
your
manner.
These
peculiarities
were
not
formerly
yours."
"Mr.
Moore,
we
will
pause
here.
You
have
exactly
hit
it.
I
am
nervous.
Now,
talk
of
something
else.
What
wet
weather
we
have
steady,
pouring
rain!"
"You
nervous?
Yes;
and
if
Miss
Keeldar
is
nervous,
it
is
not
without
a
cause.
Let
me
reach
it.
Let
me
look
nearer.
The
ailment
is
not
physical.
I
have
suspected
that.
It
came
in
one
moment.
