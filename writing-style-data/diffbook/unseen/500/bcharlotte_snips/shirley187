they
show
the
becoming,
decent
self
government
of
our
admirable
rectors.
I
watch
Moore
sometimes,
to
try
and
discover
how
he
can
be
pleased;
but
he
has
not
that
child's
simplicity
about
him.
Did
you
ever
find
out
his
accessible
point,
Caroline?
you
have
seen
more
of
him
than
I."
"It
is
not,
at
any
rate,
that
of
my
uncle
and
Dr.
Boultby,"
returned
Caroline,
smiling.
She
always
felt
a
sort
of
shy
pleasure
in
following
Miss
Keeldar's
lead
respecting
the
discussion
of
her
cousin's
character.
Left
to
herself,
she
would
never
have
touched
on
the
subject;
but
when
invited,
the
temptation
of
talking
about
him
of
whom
she
was
ever
thinking
was
irresistible.
"But,"
she
added,
"I
really
don't
know
what
it
is,
for
I
never
watched
Robert
in
my
life
but
my
scrutiny
was
presently
baffled
by
finding
he
was
watching
me."
"There
it
is!"
exclaimed
Shirley.
"You
can't
fix
your
eyes
on
him
but
his
presently
flash
on
you.
He
is
never
off
his
guard.
He
won't
give
you
an
advantage.
Even
when
he
does
not
look
at
you,
his
thoughts
seem
to
be
busy
amongst
your
own
thoughts,
tracing
your
words
and
actions
to
their
source,
contemplating
your
motives
at
his
ease.
Oh!
I
know
that
sort
of
character,
or
something
in
the
same
style.
It
is
one
that
piques
me
singularly.
How
does
it
affect
you?"
This
question
was
a
specimen
of
one
of
Shirley's
sharp,
sudden
turns.
Caroline
used
to
be
fluttered
by
them
at
first,
but
she
had
now
got
into
the
way
of
parrying
these
home
thrusts
like
a
little
Quakeress.
"Pique
you?
In
what
way
does
it
pique
you?"
she
said.
"Here
he
comes!"
suddenly
exclaimed
Shirley,
breaking
off,
starting
up
and
running
to
the
window.
"Here
comes
a
diversion.
I
never
told
you
of
a
superb
conquest
I
have
made
lately
made
at
those
parties
to
which
I
can
never
persuade
you
to
accompany
me;
and
the
thing
has
been
done
without
effort
or
intention
on
my
part
that
I
aver.
There
is
the
bell
and,
by
all
that's
delicious!
there
are
two
of
them.
Do
they
never
hunt,
then,
except
in
couples?
You
may
have
one,
Lina,
and
you
may
take
your
choice.
I
hope
I
am
generous
enough.
Listen
to
Tartar!"
The
black
muzzled,
tawny
dog,
a
glimpse
of
which
was
seen
in
the
chapter
which
first
introduced
its
mistress
to
the
reader,
here
gave
tongue
in
the
hall,
amidst
whose
hollow
space
the
deep
bark
resounded
formidably.
A
growl
more
terrible
than
the
bark,
menacing
as
muttered
thunder,
succeeded.
"Listen!"
again
cried
Shirley,
laughing.
"You
would
think
that
the
prelude
to
a
bloody
onslaught.
They
will
be
frightened.
They
don't
know
old
Tartar
as
I
do.
They
are
not
aware
his
uproars
are
all
sound
and
fury,
signifying
nothing!"
Some
bustle
was
heard.
"Down,
sir,
down!"
exclaimed
a
high
toned,
imperious
voice,
and
then
came
a
crack
of
a
cane
or
whip.
Immediately
there
was
a
yell
