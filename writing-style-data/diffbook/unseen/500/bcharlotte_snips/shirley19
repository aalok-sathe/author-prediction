therein.
England,
if
not
weary,
was
worn
with
long
resistance
yes,
and
half
her
people
were
weary
too,
and
cried
out
for
peace
on
any
terms.
National
honour
was
become
a
mere
empty
name,
of
no
value
in
the
eyes
of
many,
because
their
sight
was
dim
with
famine;
and
for
a
morsel
of
meat
they
would
have
sold
their
birthright.
The
"Orders
in
Council,"
provoked
by
Napoleon's
Milan
and
Berlin
decrees,
and
forbidding
neutral
powers
to
trade
with
France,
had,
by
offending
America,
cut
off
the
principal
market
of
the
Yorkshire
woollen
trade,
and
brought
it
consequently
to
the
verge
of
ruin.
Minor
foreign
markets
were
glutted,
and
would
receive
no
more.
The
Brazils,
Portugal,
Sicily,
were
all
overstocked
by
nearly
two
years'
consumption.
At
this
crisis
certain
inventions
in
machinery
were
introduced
into
the
staple
manufactures
of
the
north,
which,
greatly
reducing
the
number
of
hands
necessary
to
be
employed,
threw
thousands
out
of
work,
and
left
them
without
legitimate
means
of
sustaining
life.
A
bad
harvest
supervened.
Distress
reached
its
climax.
Endurance,
overgoaded,
stretched
the
hand
of
fraternity
to
sedition.
The
throes
of
a
sort
of
moral
earthquake
were
felt
heaving
under
the
hills
of
the
northern
counties.
But,
as
is
usual
in
such
cases,
nobody
took
much
notice.
When
a
food
riot
broke
out
in
a
manufacturing
town,
when
a
gig
mill
was
burnt
to
the
ground,
or
a
manufacturer's
house
was
attacked,
the
furniture
thrown
into
the
streets,
and
the
family
forced
to
flee
for
their
lives,
some
local
measures
were
or
were
not
taken
by
the
local
magistracy.
A
ringleader
was
detected,
or
more
frequently
suffered
to
elude
detection;
newspaper
paragraphs
were
written
on
the
subject,
and
there
the
thing
stopped.
As
to
the
sufferers,
whose
sole
inheritance
was
labour,
and
who
had
lost
that
inheritance
who
could
not
get
work,
and
consequently
could
not
get
wages,
and
consequently
could
not
get
bread
they
were
left
to
suffer
on,
perhaps
inevitably
left.
It
would
not
do
to
stop
the
progress
of
invention,
to
damage
science
by
discouraging
its
improvements;
the
war
could
not
be
terminated;
efficient
relief
could
not
be
raised.
There
was
no
help
then;
so
the
unemployed
underwent
their
destiny
ate
the
bread
and
drank
the
waters
of
affliction.
Misery
generates
hate.
These
sufferers
hated
the
machines
which
they
believed
took
their
bread
from
them;
they
hated
the
buildings
which
contained
those
machines;
they
hated
the
manufacturers
who
owned
those
buildings.
In
the
parish
of
Briarfield,
with
which
we
have
at
present
to
do,
Hollow's
Mill
was
the
place
held
most
abominable;
Gerard
Moore,
in
his
double
character
of
semi
foreigner
and
thorough
going
progressist,
the
man
most
abominated.
And
it
perhaps
rather
agreed
with
Moore's
temperament
than
otherwise
to
be
generally
hated,
especially
when
he
believed
the
thing
for
which
he
was
hated
a
right
and
an
expedient
thing;
and
it
was
with
a
sense
of
warlike
excitement
he,
on
this
night,
sat
in
his
counting
house
waiting
the
arrival
of
