empty
platter,
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
wept
sore.
The
curates,
meantime,
sat
and
sipped
their
wine,
a
liquor
of
unpretending
vintage,
moderately
enjoyed.
Mr.
Malone,
indeed,
would
much
rather
have
had
whisky;
but
Mr.
Donne,
being
an
Englishman,
did
not
keep
the
beverage.
While
they
sipped
they
argued,
not
on
politics,
nor
on
philosophy,
nor
on
literature
these
topics
were
now,
as
ever,
totally
without
interest
for
them
not
even
on
theology,
practical
or
doctrinal,
but
on
minute
points
of
ecclesiastical
discipline,
frivolities
which
seemed
empty
as
bubbles
to
all
save
themselves.
Mr.
Malone,
who
contrived
to
secure
two
glasses
of
wine,
when
his
brethren
contented
themselves
with
one,
waxed
by
degrees
hilarious
after
his
fashion;
that
is,
he
grew
a
little
insolent,
said
rude
things
in
a
hectoring
tone,
and
laughed
clamorously
at
his
own
brilliancy.
Each
of
his
companions
became
in
turn
his
butt.
Malone
had
a
stock
of
jokes
at
their
service,
which
he
was
accustomed
to
serve
out
regularly
on
convivial
occasions
like
the
present,
seldom
varying
his
wit;
for
which,
indeed,
there
was
no
necessity,
as
he
never
appeared
to
consider
himself
monotonous,
and
did
not
at
all
care
what
others
thought.
Mr.
Donne
he
favoured
with
hints
about
his
extreme
meagreness,
allusions
to
his
turned
up
nose,
cutting
sarcasms
on
a
certain
threadbare
chocolate
surtout
which
that
gentleman
was
accustomed
to
sport
whenever
it
rained
or
seemed
likely
to
rain,
and
criticisms
on
a
choice
set
of
cockney
phrases
and
modes
of
pronunciation,
Mr.
Donne's
own
property,
and
certainly
deserving
of
remark
for
the
elegance
and
finish
they
communicated
to
his
style.
Mr.
Sweeting
was
bantered
about
his
stature
he
was
a
little
man,
a
mere
boy
in
height
and
breadth
compared
with
the
athletic
Malone;
rallied
on
his
musical
accomplishments
he
played
the
flute
and
sang
hymns
like
a
seraph,
some
young
ladies
of
his
parish
thought;
sneered
at
as
"the
ladies'
pet;"
teased
about
his
mamma
and
sisters,
for
whom
poor
Mr.
Sweeting
had
some
lingering
regard,
and
of
whom
he
was
foolish
enough
now
and
then
to
speak
in
the
presence
of
the
priestly
Paddy,
from
whose
anatomy
the
bowels
of
natural
affection
had
somehow
been
omitted.
The
victims
met
these
attacks
each
in
his
own
way:
Mr.
Donne
with
a
stilted
self
complacency
and
half
sullen
phlegm,
the
sole
props
of
his
otherwise
somewhat
rickety
dignity;
Mr.
Sweeting
with
the
indifference
of
a
light,
easy
disposition,
which
never
professed
to
have
any
dignity
to
maintain.
When
Malone's
raillery
became
rather
too
offensive,
which
it
soon
did,
they
joined,
in
an
attempt
to
turn
the
tables
on
him
by
asking
him
how
many
boys
had
shouted
"Irish
Peter!"
after
him
as
he
came
along
the
road
that
day
(Malone's
name
was
Peter
the
Rev.
Peter
Augustus
Malone);
requesting
to
be
informed
whether
it
was
the
mode
in
Ireland
for
clergymen
to
carry
loaded
pistols
in
their
pockets,
and
a
shillelah
in
their
hands,
when
they
made
pastoral
visits;
inquiring
