turned
her
eyes
from
the
encounter
of
your
own
lest
their
clearness
should
reveal
too
much;
supposing,
in
short,
your
Mary
had
been
not
cold,
but
modest;
not
vacant,
but
reflective;
not
obtuse,
but
sensitive;
not
inane,
but
innocent;
not
prudish,
but
pure,
would
you
have
left
her
to
court
another
woman
for
her
wealth?"
Mr.
Yorke
raised
his
hat,
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief.
"The
moon
is
up,"
was
his
first
not
quite
relevant
remark,
pointing
with
his
whip
across
the
moor.
"There
she
is,
rising
into
the
haze,
staring
at
us
wi'
a
strange
red
glower.
She
is
no
more
silver
than
old
Helstone's
brow
is
ivory.
What
does
she
mean
by
leaning
her
cheek
on
Rushedge
i'
that
way,
and
looking
at
us
wi'
a
scowl
and
a
menace?"
"Yorke,
if
Mary
had
loved
you
silently
yet
faithfully,
chastely
yet
fervently,
as
you
would
wish
your
wife
to
love,
would
you
have
left
her?"
"Robert!"
he
lifted
his
arm,
he
held
it
suspended,
and
paused
"Robert!
this
is
a
queer
world,
and
men
are
made
of
the
queerest
dregs
that
Chaos
churned
up
in
her
ferment.
I
might
swear
sounding
oaths
oaths
that
would
make
the
poachers
think
there
was
a
bittern
booming
in
Bilberry
Moss
that,
in
the
case
you
put,
death
only
should
have
parted
me
from
Mary.
But
I
have
lived
in
the
world
fifty
five
years;
I
have
been
forced
to
study
human
nature;
and,
to
speak
a
dark
truth,
the
odds
are,
if
Mary
had
loved
and
not
scorned
me,
if
I
had
been
secure
of
her
affection,
certain
of
her
constancy,
been
irritated
by
no
doubts,
stung
by
no
humiliations
the
odds
are"
(he
let
his
hand
fall
heavy
on
the
saddle)
"the
odds
are
I
should
have
left
her!"
They
rode
side
by
side
in
silence.
Ere
either
spoke
again
they
were
on
the
other
side
of
Rushedge.
Briarfield
lights
starred
the
purple
skirt
of
the
moor.
Robert,
being
the
youngest,
and
having
less
of
the
past
to
absorb
him
than
his
comrade,
recommenced
first.
"I
believe
I
daily
find
it
proved
that
we
can
get
nothing
in
this
world
worth
keeping,
not
so
much
as
a
principle
or
a
conviction,
except
out
of
purifying
flame
or
through
strengthening
peril.
We
err,
we
fall,
we
are
humbled;
then
we
walk
more
carefully.
We
greedily
eat
and
drink
poison
out
of
the
gilded
cup
of
vice
or
from
the
beggar's
wallet
of
avarice.
We
are
sickened,
degraded;
everything
good
in
us
rebels
against
us;
our
souls
rise
bitterly
indignant
against
our
bodies;
there
is
a
period
of
civil
war;
if
the
soul
has
strength,
it
conquers
and
rules
thereafter."
"What
art
thou
going
to
do
now,
Robert?
What
are
thy
plans?"
"For
my
private
plans,
I'll
keep
them
to
myself
which
is
very
easy,
as
at
present
I
have
none.
No
private
life
is
permitted
a
man
in
my
position
a
man
in
debt.
For
my
public
plans,
my
views
