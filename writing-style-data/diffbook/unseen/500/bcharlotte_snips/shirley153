We
perished
each
alone!
But
I
beneath
a
rougher
sea,
And
whelmed
in
deeper
gulfs
than
he."
"I
hope
William
Cowper
is
safe
and
calm
in
heaven
now,"
said
Caroline.
"Do
you
pity
what
he
suffered
on
earth?"
asked
Miss
Keeldar.
"Pity
him,
Shirley?
What
can
I
do
else?
He
was
nearly
broken
hearted
when
he
wrote
that
poem,
and
it
almost
breaks
one's
heart
to
read
it.
But
he
found
relief
in
writing
it
I
know
he
did;
and
that
gift
of
poetry
the
most
divine
bestowed
on
man
was,
I
believe,
granted
to
allay
emotions
when
their
strength
threatens
harm.
It
seems
to
me,
Shirley,
that
nobody
should
write
poetry
to
exhibit
intellect
or
attainment.
Who
cares
for
that
sort
of
poetry?
Who
cares
for
learning
who
cares
for
fine
words
in
poetry?
And
who
does
not
care
for
feeling
real
feeling
however
simply,
even
rudely
expressed?"
"It
seems
you
care
for
it,
at
all
events;
and
certainly,
in
hearing
that
poem,
one
discovers
that
Cowper
was
under
an
impulse
strong
as
that
of
the
wind
which
drove
the
ship
an
impulse
which,
while
it
would
not
suffer
him
to
stop
to
add
ornament
to
a
single
stanza,
filled
him
with
force
to
achieve
the
whole
with
consummate
perfection.
You
managed
to
recite
it
with
a
steady
voice,
Caroline.
I
wonder
thereat."
"Cowper's
hand
did
not
tremble
in
writing
the
lines.
Why
should
my
voice
falter
in
repeating
them?
Depend
on
it,
Shirley,
no
tear
blistered
the
manuscript
of
'The
Castaway.'
I
hear
in
it
no
sob
of
sorrow,
only
the
cry
of
despair;
but,
that
cry
uttered,
I
believe
the
deadly
spasm
passed
from
his
heart,
that
he
wept
abundantly,
and
was
comforted."
Shirley
resumed
her
ballad
minstrelsy.
Stopping
short,
she
remarked
ere
long,
"One
could
have
loved
Cowper,
if
it
were
only
for
the
sake
of
having
the
privilege
of
comforting
him."
"You
never
would
have
loved
Cowper,"
rejoined
Caroline
promptly.
"He
was
not
made
to
be
loved
by
woman."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"What
I
say.
I
know
there
is
a
kind
of
natures
in
the
world
and
very
noble,
elevated
natures
too
whom
love
never
comes
near.
You
might
have
sought
Cowper
with
the
intention
of
loving
him,
and
you
would
have
looked
at
him,
pitied
him,
and
left
him,
forced
away
by
a
sense
of
the
impossible,
the
incongruous,
as
the
crew
were
borne
from
their
drowning
comrade
by
'the
furious
blast.'"
"You
may
be
right.
Who
told
you
this?"
"And
what
I
say
of
Cowper,
I
should
say
of
Rousseau.
Was
Rousseau
ever
loved?
He
loved
passionately;
but
was
his
passion
ever
returned?
I
am
certain,
never.
And
if
there
were
any
female
Cowpers
and
Rousseaus,
I
should
assert
the
same
of
them."
"Who
told
you
this,
I
ask?
Did
Moore?"
"Why
should
anybody
have
told
me?
Have
I
not
an
instinct?
Can
I
not
divine
by
analogy?
Moore
never
talked
to
me
either
about
Cowper,
or
Rousseau,
or
love.
