monopolizing
the
contents,
had
the
first
view
of
every
sketch
herself.
She
enjoyed
the
treat
if
treat
it
were
in
silence,
without
a
single
comment.
Moore
stood
behind
her
chair
and
looked
over
her
shoulder,
and
when
she
had
done
and
the
others
were
still
gazing,
he
left
his
post
and
paced
through
the
room.
A
carriage
was
heard
in
the
lane
the
gate
bell
rang.
Shirley
started.
"There
are
callers,"
she
said,
"and
I
shall
be
summoned
to
the
room.
A
pretty
figure
as
they
say
I
am
to
receive
company.
I
and
Henry
have
been
in
the
garden
gathering
fruit
half
the
morning.
Oh
for
rest
under
my
own
vine
and
my
own
fig
tree!
Happy
is
the
slave
wife
of
the
Indian
chief,
in
that
she
has
no
drawing
room
duty
to
perform,
but
can
sit
at
ease
weaving
mats,
and
stringing
beads,
and
peacefully
flattening
her
pickaninny's
head
in
an
unmolested
corner
of
her
wigwam.
I'll
emigrate
to
the
western
woods."
Louis
Moore
laughed.
"To
marry
a
White
Cloud
or
a
Big
Buffalo,
and
after
wedlock
to
devote
yourself
to
the
tender
task
of
digging
your
lord's
maize
field
while
he
smokes
his
pipe
or
drinks
fire
water."
Shirley
seemed
about
to
reply,
but
here
the
schoolroom
door
unclosed,
admitting
Mr.
Sympson.
That
personage
stood
aghast
when
he
saw
the
group
around
the
fire.
"I
thought
you
alone,
Miss
Keeldar,"
he
said.
"I
find
quite
a
party."
And
evidently
from
his
shocked,
scandalized
air,
had
he
not
recognized
in
one
of
the
party
a
clergyman,
he
would
have
delivered
an
extempore
philippic
on
the
extraordinary
habits
of
his
niece:
respect
for
the
cloth
arrested
him.
"I
merely
wished
to
announce,"
he
proceeded
coldly,
"that
the
family
from
De
Walden
Hall,
Mr.,
Mrs.,
the
Misses,
and
Mr.
Sam
Wynne,
are
in
the
drawing
room."
And
he
bowed
and
withdrew.
"The
family
from
De
Walden
Hall!
Couldn't
be
a
worse
set,"
murmured
Shirley.
She
sat
still,
looking
a
little
contumacious,
and
very
much
indisposed
to
stir.
She
was
flushed
with
the
fire.
Her
dark
hair
had
been
more
than
once
dishevelled
by
the
morning
wind
that
day.
Her
attire
was
a
light,
neatly
fitting,
but
amply
flowing
dress
of
muslin;
the
shawl
she
had
worn
in
the
garden
was
still
draped
in
a
careless
fold
round
her.
Indolent,
wilful,
picturesque,
and
singularly
pretty
was
her
aspect
prettier
than
usual,
as
if
some
soft
inward
emotion,
stirred
who
knows
how,
had
given
new
bloom
and
expression
to
her
features.
"Shirley,
Shirley,
you
ought
to
go,"
whispered
Caroline.
"I
wonder
why?"
She
lifted
her
eyes,
and
saw
in
the
glass
over
the
fireplace
both
Mr.
Hall
and
Louis
Moore
gazing
at
her
gravely.
"If,"
she
said,
with
a
yielding
smile
"if
a
majority
of
the
present
company
maintain
that
the
De
Walden
Hall
people
have
claims
on
my
civility,
I
will
subdue
my
inclinations
to
my
duty.
Let
those
who
think
I
ought
to
go
hold
up
their
hands."
