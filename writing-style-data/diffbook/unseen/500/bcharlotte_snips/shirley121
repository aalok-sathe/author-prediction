when
the
world
has
rolled
round
a
few
times
more.
So
much
for
the
body.
The
soul
meantime
wings
its
long
flight
upward,
folds
its
wings
on
the
brink
of
the
sea
of
fire
and
glass,
and
gazing
down
through
the
burning
clearness,
finds
there
mirrored
the
vision
of
the
Christian's
triple
Godhead
the
sovereign
Father,
the
mediating
Son,
the
Creator
Spirit.
Such
words,
at
least,
have
been
chosen
to
express
what
is
inexpressible,
to
describe
what
baffles
description.
The
soul's
real
hereafter
who
shall
guess?"
Her
fire
was
decayed
to
its
last
cinder;
Malone
had
departed;
and
now
the
study
bell
rang
for
prayers.
The
next
day
Caroline
had
to
spend
altogether
alone,
her
uncle
being
gone
to
dine
with
his
friend
Dr.
Boultby,
vicar
of
Whinbury.
The
whole
time
she
was
talking
inwardly
in
the
same
strain
looking
forwards,
asking
what
she
was
to
do
with
life.
Fanny,
as
she
passed
in
and
out
of
the
room
occasionally,
intent
on
housemaid
errands,
perceived
that
her
young
mistress
sat
very
still.
She
was
always
in
the
same
place,
always
bent
industriously
over
a
piece
of
work.
She
did
not
lift
her
head
to
speak
to
Fanny,
as
her
custom
was;
and
when
the
latter
remarked
that
the
day
was
fine,
and
she
ought
to
take
a
walk,
she
only
said,
"It
is
cold."
"You
are
very
diligent
at
that
sewing,
Miss
Caroline,"
continued
the
girl,
approaching
her
little
table.
"I
am
tired
of
it,
Fanny."
"Then
why
do
you
go
on
with
it?
Put
it
down.
Read,
or
do
something
to
amuse
you."
"It
is
solitary
in
this
house,
Fanny.
Don't
you
think
so?"
"I
don't
find
it
so,
miss.
Me
and
Eliza
are
company
for
one
another;
but
you
are
quite
too
still.
You
should
visit
more.
Now,
be
persuaded:
go
upstairs
and
dress
yourself
smart,
and
go
and
take
tea,
in
a
friendly
way,
with
Miss
Mann
or
Miss
Ainley.
I
am
certain
either
of
those
ladies
would
be
delighted
to
see
you."
"But
their
houses
are
dismal:
they
are
both
old
maids.
I
am
certain
old
maids
are
a
very
unhappy
race."
"Not
they,
miss.
They
can't
be
unhappy;
they
take
such
care
of
themselves.
They
are
all
selfish."
"Miss
Ainley
is
not
selfish,
Fanny.
She
is
always
doing
good.
How
devotedly
kind
she
was
to
her
step
mother
as
long
as
the
old
lady
lived;
and
now
when
she
is
quite
alone
in
the
world,
without
brother
or
sister,
or
any
one
to
care
for
her,
how
charitable
she
is
to
the
poor,
as
far
as
her
means
permit!
Still
nobody
thinks
much
of
her,
or
has
pleasure
in
going
to
see
her;
and
how
gentlemen
always
sneer
at
her!"
"They
shouldn't,
miss.
I
believe
she
is
a
good
woman.
But
gentlemen
think
only
of
ladies'
looks."
"I'll
go
and
see
her,"
exclaimed
Caroline,
starting
up;
"and
if
she
asks
me
to
stay
to
tea,
I'll
stay.
How
wrong
it
is
to
neglect
people
because
