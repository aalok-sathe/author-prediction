mutinous.
It
was
strange
that
with
all
her
strictness,
with
all
her
"strong
mindedness,"
she
could
gain
no
command
over
them.
A
look
from
their
father
had
more
influence
with
them
than
a
lecture
from
her.
Miss
Moore
to
whom
the
position
of
witness
to
an
altercation
in
which
she
took
no
part
was
highly
displeasing,
as
being
an
unimportant
secondary
post
now
rallying
her
dignity,
prepared
to
utter
a
discourse
which
was
to
prove
both
parties
in
the
wrong,
and
to
make
it
clear
to
each
disputant
that
she
had
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
herself,
and
ought
to
submit
humbly
to
the
superior
sense
of
the
individual
then
addressing
her.
Fortunately
for
her
audience,
she
had
not
harangued
above
ten
minutes
when
Sarah's
entrance
with
the
tea
tray
called
her
attention,
first
to
the
fact
of
that
damsel
having
a
gilt
comb
in
her
hair
and
a
red
necklace
round
her
throat,
and
secondly,
and
subsequently
to
a
pointed
remonstrance,
to
the
duty
of
making
tea.
After
the
meal
Rose
restored
her
to
good
humour
by
bringing
her
guitar
and
asking
for
a
song,
and
afterwards
engaging
her
in
an
intelligent
and
sharp
cross
examination
about
guitar
playing
and
music
in
general.
Jessie,
meantime,
directed
her
assiduities
to
Caroline.
Sitting
on
a
stool
at
her
feet,
she
talked
to
her,
first
about
religion
and
then
about
politics.
Jessie
was
accustomed
at
home
to
drink
in
a
great
deal
of
what
her
father
said
on
these
subjects,
and
afterwards
in
company
to
retail,
with
more
wit
and
fluency
than
consistency
or
discretion,
his
opinions,
antipathies,
and
preferences.
She
rated
Caroline
soundly
for
being
a
member
of
the
Established
Church,
and
for
having
an
uncle
a
clergyman.
She
informed
her
that
she
lived
on
the
country,
and
ought
to
work
for
her
living
honestly,
instead
of
passing
a
useless
life,
and
eating
the
bread
of
idleness
in
the
shape
of
tithes.
Thence
Jessie
passed
to
a
review
of
the
ministry
at
that
time
in
office,
and
a
consideration
of
its
deserts.
She
made
familiar
mention
of
the
names
of
Lord
Castlereagh
and
Mr.
Perceval.
Each
of
these
personages
she
adorned
with
a
character
that
might
have
separately
suited
Moloch
and
Belial.
She
denounced
the
war
as
wholesale
murder,
and
Lord
Wellington
as
a
"hired
butcher."
Her
auditress
listened
with
exceeding
edification.
Jessie
had
something
of
the
genius
of
humour
in
her
nature.
It
was
inexpressibly
comic
to
hear
her
repeating
her
sire's
denunciations
in
his
nervous
northern
Doric;
as
hearty
a
little
Jacobin
as
ever
pent
a
free
mutinous
spirit
in
a
muslin
frock
and
sash.
Not
malignant
by
nature,
her
language
was
not
so
bitter
as
it
was
racy,
and
the
expressive
little
face
gave
a
piquancy
to
every
phrase
which
held
a
beholder's
interest
captive.
Caroline
chid
her
when
she
abused
Lord
Wellington;
but
she
listened
delighted
to
a
subsequent
tirade
against
the
Prince
Regent.
Jessie
quickly
read,
in
the
sparkle
of
her
hearer's
eye
and
the
laughter
