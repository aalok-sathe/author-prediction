another
storm
of
tears
would
fall,
and
then
I
believed
some
calm
and
some
sunshine
must
come,
and
I
would
wait
for
it.
"As
fast,
but
more
quietly
than
before,
the
warm
rain
streamed
down.
There
was
another
sound
in
her
weeping
a
softer,
more
regretful
sound.
While
I
watched,
her
eyes
lifted
to
me
a
gaze
more
reproachful
than
haughty,
more
mournful
than
incensed.
"'O
Moore!'
said
she.
It
was
worse
than
'Et
tu,
Brute!'
"I
relieved
myself
by
what
should
have
been
a
sigh,
but
it
became
a
groan.
A
sense
of
Cain
like
desolation
made
my
breast
ache.
"'There
has
been
error
in
what
I
have
done,'
I
said,
'and
it
has
won
me
bitter
wages,
which
I
will
go
and
spend
far
from
her
who
gave
them.'
"I
took
my
hat.
All
the
time
I
could
not
have
borne
to
depart
so,
and
I
believed
she
would
not
let
me.
Nor
would
she
but
for
the
mortal
pang
I
had
given
her
pride,
that
cowed
her
compassion
and
kept
her
silent.
"I
was
obliged
to
turn
back
of
my
own
accord
when
I
reached
the
door,
to
approach
her,
and
to
say,
'Forgive
me.'
"'I
could,
if
there
was
not
myself
to
forgive
too,'
was
her
reply;
'but
to
mislead
a
sagacious
man
so
far
I
must
have
done
wrong.'
"I
broke
out
suddenly
with
some
declamation
I
do
not
remember.
I
know
that
it
was
sincere,
and
that
my
wish
and
aim
were
to
absolve
her
to
herself.
In
fact,
in
her
case
self
accusation
was
a
chimera.
"At
last
she
extended
her
hand.
For
the
first
time
I
wished
to
take
her
in
my
arms
and
kiss
her.
I
did
kiss
her
hand
many
times.
"'Some
day
we
shall
be
friends
again,'
she
said,
'when
you
have
had
time
to
read
my
actions
and
motives
in
a
true
light,
and
not
so
horribly
to
misinterpret
them.
Time
may
give
you
the
right
key
to
all.
Then,
perhaps,
you
will
comprehend
me,
and
then
we
shall
be
reconciled.'
"Farewell
drops
rolled
slow
down
her
cheeks.
She
wiped
them
away.
"'I
am
sorry
for
what
has
happened
deeply
sorry,'
she
sobbed.
So
was
I,
God
knows!
Thus
were
we
severed."
"A
queer
tale!"
commented
Mr.
Yorke.
"I'll
do
it
no
more,"
vowed
his
companion;
"never
more
will
I
mention
marriage
to
a
woman
unless
I
feel
love.
Henceforth
credit
and
commerce
may
take
care
of
themselves.
Bankruptcy
may
come
when
it
lists.
I
have
done
with
slavish
fear
of
disaster.
I
mean
to
work
diligently,
wait
patiently,
bear
steadily.
Let
the
worst
come,
I
will
take
my
axe
and
an
emigrant's
berth,
and
go
out
with
Louis
to
the
West;
he
and
I
have
settled
it.
No
woman
shall
ever
again
look
at
me
as
Miss
Keeldar
looked,
ever
again
feel
towards
me
as
Miss
Keeldar
felt.
In
no
woman's
presence
will
I
ever
again
stand
at
once
such
a
fool
and
such
a
knave,
such
