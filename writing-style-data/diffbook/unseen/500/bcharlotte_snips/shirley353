in
the
court
for
the
chance
of
witnessing
her
return,
and
for
the
dearer
chance
of
receiving
her
in
my
arms
from
the
saddle.
I
have
noticed
(again
it
is
to
this
page
only
I
would
make
the
remark)
that
she
will
never
permit
any
man
but
myself
to
render
her
that
assistance.
I
have
seen
her
politely
decline
Sir
Philip
Nunnely's
aid.
She
is
always
mighty
gentle
with
her
young
baronet,
mighty
tender
for
his
feelings,
forsooth,
and
of
his
very
thin
skinned
amour
propre.
I
have
marked
her
haughtily
reject
Sam
Wynne's.
Now
I
know
my
heart
knows
it,
for
it
has
felt
it
that
she
resigns
herself
to
me
unreluctantly.
Is
she
conscious
how
my
strength
rejoices
to
serve
her?
I
myself
am
not
her
slave
I
declare
it
but
my
faculties
gather
to
her
beauty,
like
the
genii
to
the
glisten
of
the
lamp.
All
my
knowledge,
all
my
prudence,
all
my
calm,
and
all
my
power
stand
in
her
presence
humbly
waiting
a
task.
How
glad
they
are
when
a
mandate
comes!
What
joy
they
take
in
the
toils
she
assigns!
Does
she
know
it?
"I
have
called
her
careless.
It
is
remarkable
that
her
carelessness
never
compromises
her
refinement.
Indeed,
through
this
very
loophole
of
character,
the
reality,
depth,
genuineness
of
that
refinement
may
be
ascertained.
A
whole
garment
sometimes
covers
meagreness
and
malformation;
through
a
rent
sleeve
a
fair
round
arm
may
be
revealed.
I
have
seen
and
handled
many
of
her
possessions,
because
they
are
frequently
astray.
I
never
saw
anything
that
did
not
proclaim
the
lady
nothing
sordid,
nothing
soiled.
In
one
sense
she
is
as
scrupulous
as,
in
another,
she
is
unthinking.
As
a
peasant
girl,
she
would
go
ever
trim
and
cleanly.
Look
at
the
pure
kid
of
this
little
glove,
at
the
fresh,
unsullied
satin
of
the
bag.
"What
a
difference
there
is
between
S.
and
that
pearl
C.
H.!
Caroline,
I
fancy,
is
the
soul
of
conscientious
punctuality
and
nice
exactitude.
She
would
precisely
suit
the
domestic
habits
of
a
certain
fastidious
kinsman
of
mine
so
delicate,
dexterous,
quaint,
quick,
quiet
all
done
to
a
minute,
all
arranged
to
a
strawbreadth.
She
would
suit
Robert.
But
what
could
I
do
with
anything
so
nearly
faultless?
She
is
my
equal,
poor
as
myself.
She
is
certainly
pretty:
a
little
Raffaelle
head
hers
Raffaelle
in
feature,
quite
English
in
expression,
all
insular
grace
and
purity;
but
where
is
there
anything
to
alter,
anything
to
endure,
anything
to
reprimand,
to
be
anxious
about?
There
she
is,
a
lily
of
the
valley,
untinted,
needing
no
tint.
What
change
could
improve
her?
What
pencil
dare
to
paint?
My
sweetheart,
if
I
ever
have
one,
must
bear
nearer
affinity
to
the
rose
a
sweet,
lively
delight
guarded
with
prickly
peril.
My
wife,
if
I
ever
marry,
must
stir
my
great
frame
with
a
sting
now
and
then;
she
must
furnish
use
to
her
husband's
vast
mass
of
patience.
I
was
not
made
so
