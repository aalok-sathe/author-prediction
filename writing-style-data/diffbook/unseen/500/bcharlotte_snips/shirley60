games
that
only
keep
one's
hands
employed,
don't
we?"
"I
believe
we
do.
Then
shall
we
talk
scandal?"
"About
whom?
Are
we
sufficiently
interested
in
anybody
to
take
a
pleasure
in
pulling
their
character
to
pieces?"
"A
question
that
comes
to
the
point.
For
my
part,
unamiable
as
it
sounds,
I
must
say
no."
"And
I
too.
But
it
is
strange,
though
we
want
no
third
fourth,
I
mean
(she
hastily
and
with
contrition
glanced
at
Hortense),
living
person
among
us
so
selfish
we
are
in
our
happiness
though
we
don't
want
to
think
of
the
present
existing
world,
it
would
be
pleasant
to
go
back
to
the
past,
to
hear
people
that
have
slept
for
generations
in
graves
that
are
perhaps
no
longer
graves
now,
but
gardens
and
fields,
speak
to
us
and
tell
us
their
thoughts,
and
impart
their
ideas."
"Who
shall
be
the
speaker?
What
language
shall
he
utter?
French?"
"Your
French
forefathers
don't
speak
so
sweetly,
nor
so
solemnly,
nor
so
impressively
as
your
English
ancestors,
Robert.
To
night
you
shall
be
entirely
English.
You
shall
read
an
English
book."
"An
old
English
book?"
"Yes,
an
old
English
book
one
that
you
like;
and
I
will
choose
a
part
of
it
that
is
toned
quite
in
harmony
with
something
in
you.
It
shall
waken
your
nature,
fill
your
mind
with
music;
it
shall
pass
like
a
skilful
hand
over
your
heart,
and
make
its
strings
sound.
Your
heart
is
a
lyre,
Robert;
but
the
lot
of
your
life
has
not
been
a
minstrel
to
sweep
it,
and
it
is
often
silent.
Let
glorious
William
come
near
and
touch
it.
You
will
see
how
he
will
draw
the
English
power
and
melody
out
of
its
chords."
"I
must
read
Shakespeare?"
"You
must
have
his
spirit
before
you;
you
must
hear
his
voice
with
your
mind's
ear;
you
must
take
some
of
his
soul
into
yours."
"With
a
view
to
making
me
better?
Is
it
to
operate
like
a
sermon?"
"It
is
to
stir
you,
to
give
you
new
sensations.
It
is
to
make
you
feel
your
life
strongly
not
only
your
virtues,
but
your
vicious,
perverse
points."
"Dieu!
que
dit
elle?"
cried
Hortense,
who
hitherto
had
been
counting
stitches
in
her
knitting,
and
had
not
much
attended
to
what
was
said,
but
whose
ear
these
two
strong
words
caught
with
a
tweak.
"Never
mind
her,
sister;
let
her
talk.
Now
just
let
her
say
anything
she
pleases
to
night.
She
likes
to
come
down
hard
upon
your
brother
sometimes.
It
amuses
me,
so
let
her
alone."
Caroline,
who,
mounted
on
a
chair,
had
been
rummaging
the
bookcase,
returned
with
a
book.
"Here's
Shakespeare,"
she
said,
"and
there's
'Coriolanus.'
Now,
read,
and
discover
by
the
feelings
the
reading
will
give
you
at
once
how
low
and
how
high
you
are."
"Come,
then,
sit
near
me,
and
correct
when
I
mispronounce."
"I
am
to
be
the
teacher
then,
and
you
my
pupil?"
"Ainsi,
soit
il!"
"And
Shakespeare
is
