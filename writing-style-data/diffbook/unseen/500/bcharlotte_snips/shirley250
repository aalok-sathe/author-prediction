the
benefit
of
the
fighting
parsons,
the
"sanguinary,
demoniac"
rector
and
curate.
According
to
him,
the
cup
of
ecclesiastical
guilt
was
now
full
indeed.
"The
church,"
he
said,
"was
in
a
bonny
pickle
now.
It
was
time
it
came
down
when
parsons
took
to
swaggering
amang
soldiers,
blazing
away
wi'
bullet
and
gunpowder,
taking
the
lives
of
far
honester
men
than
themselves."
"What
would
Moore
have
done
if
nobody
had
helped
him?"
asked
Shirley.
"Drunk
as
he'd
brewed,
eaten
as
he'd
baked."
"Which
means
you
would
have
left
him
by
himself
to
face
that
mob.
Good!
He
has
plenty
of
courage,
but
the
greatest
amount
of
gallantry
that
ever
garrisoned
one
human
breast
could
scarce
avail
against
two
hundred."
"He
had
the
soldiers,
those
poor
slaves
who
hire
out
their
own
blood
and
spill
other
folk's
for
money."
"You
abuse
soldiers
almost
as
much
as
you
abuse
clergymen.
All
who
wear
red
coats
are
national
refuse
in
your
eyes,
and
all
who
wear
black
are
national
swindlers.
Mr.
Moore,
according
to
you,
did
wrong
to
get
military
aid,
and
he
did
still
worse
to
accept
of
any
other
aid.
Your
way
of
talking
amounts
to
this:
he
should
have
abandoned
his
mill
and
his
life
to
the
rage
of
a
set
of
misguided
madmen,
and
Mr.
Helstone
and
every
other
gentleman
in
the
parish
should
have
looked
on,
and
seen
the
building
razed
and
its
owner
slaughtered,
and
never
stirred
a
finger
to
save
either."
"If
Moore
had
behaved
to
his
men
from
the
beginning
as
a
master
ought
to
behave,
they
never
would
have
entertained
their
present
feelings
towards
him."
"Easy
for
you
to
talk,"
exclaimed
Miss
Keeldar,
who
was
beginning
to
wax
warm
in
her
tenant's
cause
"you,
whose
family
have
lived
at
Briarmains
for
six
generations,
to
whose
person
the
people
have
been
accustomed
for
fifty
years,
who
know
all
their
ways,
prejudices,
and
preferences
easy,
indeed,
for
you
to
act
so
as
to
avoid
offending
them.
But
Mr.
Moore
came
a
stranger
into
the
district;
he
came
here
poor
and
friendless,
with
nothing
but
his
own
energies
to
back
him,
nothing
but
his
honour,
his
talent,
and
his
industry
to
make
his
way
for
him.
A
monstrous
crime
indeed
that,
under
such
circumstances,
he
could
not
popularize
his
naturally
grave,
quiet
manners
all
at
once;
could
not
be
jocular,
and
free,
and
cordial
with
a
strange
peasantry,
as
you
are
with
your
fellow
townsmen!
An
unpardonable
transgression
that
when
he
introduced
improvements
he
did
not
go
about
the
business
in
quite
the
most
politic
way,
did
not
graduate
his
changes
as
delicately
as
a
rich
capitalist
might
have
done!
For
errors
of
this
sort
is
he
to
be
the
victim
of
mob
outrage?
Is
he
to
be
denied
even
the
privilege
of
defending
himself?
Are
those
who
have
the
hearts
of
men
in
their
breasts
(and
Mr.
Helstone,
say
what
you
will
of
him,
has
such
a
heart)
to
be
reviled
like
malefactors
because
they
stand
