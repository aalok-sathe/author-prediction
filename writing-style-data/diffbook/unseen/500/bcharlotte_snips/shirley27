set
with
lights
in
their
pitchers,
like
the
army
of
Gideon;
and
as
we've
th'
parson
wi',
us
good
evening,
Mr.
Helstone
we'se
do."
Mr.
Helstone
returned
the
salutation
of
the
individual
in
the
gig
very
stiffly
indeed.
That
individual
proceeded,
"We're
eleven
strong
men,
and
there's
both
horses
and
chariots
amang
us.
If
we
could
only
fall
in
wi'
some
of
these
starved
ragamuffins
of
frame
breakers
we
could
win
a
grand
victory.
We
could
iv'ry
one
be
a
Wellington
that
would
please
ye,
Mr.
Helstone
and
sich
paragraphs
as
we
could
contrive
for
t'
papers!
Briarfield
suld
be
famous.
But
we'se
hev
a
column
and
a
half
i'
th'
Stilbro'
Courier
ower
this
job,
as
it
is,
I
dare
say.
I'se
expect
no
less."
"And
I'll
promise
you
no
less,
Mr.
Yorke,
for
I'll
write
the
article
myself,"
returned
the
rector.
"To
be
sure
sartainly!
And
mind
ye
recommend
weel
that
them
'at
brake
t'
bits
o'
frames,
and
teed
Joe
Scott's
legs
wi'
band,
suld
be
hung
without
benefit
o'
clergy.
It's
a
hanging
matter,
or
suld
be.
No
doubt
o'
that."
"If
I
judged
them
I'd
give
them
short
shrift!"
cried
Moore.
"But
I
mean
to
let
them
quite
alone
this
bout,
to
give
them
rope
enough,
certain
that
in
the
end
they
will
hang
themselves."
"Let
them
alone,
will
ye,
Moore?
Do
you
promise
that?"
"Promise!
No.
All
I
mean
to
say
is,
I
shall
give
myself
no
particular
trouble
to
catch
them;
but
if
one
falls
in
my
way
"
"You'll
snap
him
up,
of
course.
Only
you
would
rather
they
would
do
something
worse
than
merely
stop
a
wagon
before
you
reckon
with
them.
Well,
we'll
say
no
more
on
the
subject
at
present.
Here
we
are
at
my
door,
gentlemen,
and
I
hope
you
and
the
men
will
step
in.
You
will
none
of
you
be
the
worse
of
a
little
refreshment."
Moore
and
Helstone
opposed
this
proposition
as
unnecessary.
It
was,
however,
pressed
on
them
so
courteously,
and
the
night,
besides,
was
so
inclement,
and
the
gleam
from
the
muslin
curtained
windows
of
the
house
before
which
they
had
halted
looked
so
inviting,
that
at
length
they
yielded.
Mr.
Yorke,
after
having
alighted
from
his
gig,
which
he
left
in
charge
of
a
man
who
issued
from
an
outbuilding
on
his
arrival,
led
the
way
in.
It
will
have
been
remarked
that
Mr.
Yorke
varied
a
little
in
his
phraseology.
Now
he
spoke
broad
Yorkshire,
and
anon
he
expressed
himself
in
very
pure
English.
His
manner
seemed
liable
to
equal
alternations.
He
could
be
polite
and
affable,
and
he
could
be
blunt
and
rough.
His
station
then
you
could
not
easily
determine
by
his
speech
and
demeanour.
Perhaps
the
appearance
of
his
residence
may
decide
it.
The
men
he
recommended
to
take
the
kitchen
way,
saying
that
he
would
"see
them
served
wi'
summat
to
taste
presently."
The
gentlemen
were
ushered
in
at
the
front
entrance.
They
found
themselves
in
a
