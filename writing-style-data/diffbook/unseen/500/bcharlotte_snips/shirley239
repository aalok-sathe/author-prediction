all
night;
the
effect
of
the
terrible
drama
which
had
just
been
enacted
before
her
eyes
was
not
likely
to
quit
her
for
days.
It
was
vain
even
to
try
to
retain
a
recumbent
posture;
she
sat
up
by
Shirley's
side,
counting
the
slow
minutes,
and
watching
the
June
sun
mount
the
heavens.
Life
wastes
fast
in
such
vigils
as
Caroline
had
of
late
but
too
often
kept
vigils
during
which
the
mind,
having
no
pleasant
food
to
nourish
it,
no
manna
of
hope,
no
hived
honey
of
joyous
memories,
tries
to
live
on
the
meagre
diet
of
wishes,
and
failing
to
derive
thence
either
delight
or
support,
and
feeling
itself
ready
to
perish
with
craving
want,
turns
to
philosophy,
to
resolution,
to
resignation;
calls
on
all
these
gods
for
aid,
calls
vainly
is
unheard,
unhelped,
and
languishes.
Caroline
was
a
Christian;
therefore
in
trouble
she
framed
many
a
prayer
after
the
Christian
creed,
preferred
it
with
deep
earnestness,
begged
for
patience,
strength,
relief.
This
world,
however,
we
all
know,
is
the
scene
of
trial
and
probation;
and,
for
any
favourable
result
her
petitions
had
yet
wrought,
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
were
unheard
and
unaccepted.
She
believed,
sometimes,
that
God
had
turned
His
face
from
her.
At
moments
she
was
a
Calvinist,
and,
sinking
into
the
gulf
of
religious
despair,
she
saw
darkening
over
her
the
doom
of
reprobation.
Most
people
have
had
a
period
or
periods
in
their
lives
when
they
have
felt
thus
forsaken
when,
having
long
hoped
against
hope,
and
still
seen
the
day
of
fruition
deferred,
their
hearts
have
truly
sickened
within
them.
This
is
a
terrible
hour,
but
it
is
often
that
darkest
point
which
precedes
the
rise
of
day
that
turn
of
the
year
when
the
icy
January
wind
carries
over
the
waste
at
once
the
dirge
of
departing
winter
and
the
prophecy
of
coming
spring.
The
perishing
birds,
however,
cannot
thus
understand
the
blast
before
which
they
shiver;
and
as
little
can
the
suffering
soul
recognize,
in
the
climax
of
its
affliction,
the
dawn
of
its
deliverance.
Yet,
let
whoever
grieves
still
cling
fast
to
love
and
faith
in
God.
God
will
never
deceive,
never
finally
desert
him.
"Whom
He
loveth,
He
chasteneth."
These
words
are
true,
and
should
not
be
forgotten.
The
household
was
astir
at
last;
the
servants
were
up;
the
shutters
were
opened
below.
Caroline,
as
she
quitted
the
couch,
which
had
been
but
a
thorny
one
to
her,
felt
that
revival
of
spirits
which
the
return
of
day,
of
action,
gives
to
all
but
the
wholly
despairing
or
actually
dying.
She
dressed
herself,
as
usual,
carefully,
trying
so
to
arrange
her
hair
and
attire
that
nothing
of
the
forlornness
she
felt
at
heart
should
be
visible
externally.
She
looked
as
fresh
as
Shirley
when
both
were
dressed,
only
that
Miss
Keeldar's
eyes
were
lively,
and
Miss
Helstone's
languid.
"To
day
I
shall
have
much
to
say
to
Moore,"
were
Shirley's
first
words;
and
you
could
see
in
