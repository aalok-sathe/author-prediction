The
scheme
led
to
nothing;
still
he
liked
it.
Having
reached
home,
the
dry
bread
and
the
lecture
were
duly
administered
to
him,
and
he
was
dismissed
to
bed
at
an
early
hour.
He
accepted
his
punishment
with
the
toughest
stoicism.
Ere
ascending
to
his
chamber
he
paid
a
secret
visit
to
the
dining
room,
a
still,
cold,
stately
apartment,
seldom
used,
for
the
family
customarily
dined
in
the
back
parlour.
He
stood
before
the
mantelpiece,
and
lifted
his
candle
to
two
pictures
hung
above
female
heads:
one,
a
type
of
serene
beauty,
happy
and
innocent;
the
other,
more
lovely,
but
forlorn
and
desperate.
"She
looked
like
that,"
he
said,
gazing
on
the
latter
sketch,
"when
she
sobbed,
turned
white,
and
leaned
against
the
tree."
"I
suppose,"
he
pursued,
when
he
was
in
his
room,
and
seated
on
the
edge
of
his
pallet
bed
"I
suppose
she
is
what
they
call
'in
love'
yes,
in
love
with
that
long
thing
in
the
next
chamber.
Whisht!
is
that
Horsfall
clattering
him?
I
wonder
he
does
not
yell
out.
It
really
sounds
as
if
she
had
fallen
on
him
tooth
and
nail;
but
I
suppose
she
is
making
the
bed.
I
saw
her
at
it
once.
She
hit
into
the
mattresses
as
if
she
was
boxing.
It
is
queer,
Zillah
(they
call
her
Zillah)
Zillah
Horsfall
is
a
woman,
and
Caroline
Helstone
is
a
woman;
they
are
two
individuals
of
the
same
species
not
much
alike
though.
Is
she
a
pretty
girl,
that
Caroline?
I
suspect
she
is;
very
nice
to
look
at
something
so
clear
in
her
face,
so
soft
in
her
eyes.
I
approve
of
her
looking
at
me;
it
does
me
good.
She
has
long
eyelashes.
Their
shadow
seems
to
rest
where
she
gazes,
and
to
instil
peace
and
thought.
If
she
behaves
well,
and
continues
to
suit
me
as
she
has
suited
me
to
day,
I
may
do
her
a
good
turn.
I
rather
relish
the
notion
of
circumventing
my
mother
and
that
ogress
old
Horsfall.
Not
that
I
like
humouring
Moore;
but
whatever
I
do
I'll
be
paid
for,
and
in
coin
of
my
own
choosing.
I
know
what
reward
I
will
claim
one
displeasing
to
Moore,
and
agreeable
to
myself."
He
turned
into
bed.
It
was
necessary
to
the
arrangement
of
Martin's
plan
that
he
should
stay
at
home
that
day.
Accordingly,
he
found
no
appetite
for
breakfast,
and
just
about
school
time
took
a
severe
pain
about
his
heart,
which
rendered
it
advisable
that,
instead
of
setting
out
to
the
grammar
school
with
Mark,
he
should
succeed
to
his
father's
arm
chair
by
the
fireside,
and
also
to
his
morning
paper.
This
point
being
satisfactorily
settled,
and
Mark
being
gone
to
Mr.
Summer's
class,
and
Matthew
and
Mr.
Yorke
withdrawn
to
the
counting
house,
three
other
exploits
nay,
four
remained
to
be
achieved.
The
first
of
these
was
to
realize
the
breakfast
he
had
not
yet
tasted,
and
with
which
his
appetite
of
fifteen
could
