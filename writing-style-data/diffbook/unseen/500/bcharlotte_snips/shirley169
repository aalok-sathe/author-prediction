for
its
narrow
stripe
of
pale
azure,
her
complexion
unflushed,
unexcited,
the
very
brownness
of
her
hair
and
eyes
invisible
by
this
faint
light,
she
was,
compared
with
the
heiress,
as
a
graceful
pencil
sketch
compared
with
a
vivid
painting.
Since
Robert
had
seen
her
last
a
great
change
had
been
wrought
in
her.
Whether
he
perceived
it
might
not
be
ascertained.
He
said
nothing
to
that
effect.
"How
is
Hortense?"
asked
Caroline
softly.
"Very
well;
but
she
complains
of
being
unemployed.
She
misses
you."
"Tell
her
that
I
miss
her,
and
that
I
write
and
read
a
portion
of
French
every
day."
"She
will
ask
if
you
sent
your
love;
she
is
always
particular
on
that
point.
You
know
she
likes
attention."
"My
best
love
my
very
best.
And
say
to
her
that
whenever
she
has
time
to
write
me
a
little
note
I
shall
be
glad
to
hear
from
her."
"What
if
I
forget?
I
am
not
the
surest
messenger
of
compliments."
"No,
don't
forget,
Robert.
It
is
no
compliment;
it
is
in
good
earnest."
"And
must,
therefore,
be
delivered
punctually."
"If
you
please."
"Hortense
will
be
ready
to
shed
tears.
She
is
tenderhearted
on
the
subject
of
her
pupil;
yet
she
reproaches
you
sometimes
for
obeying
your
uncle's
injunctions
too
literally.
Affection,
like
love,
will
be
unjust
now
and
then."
And
Caroline
made
no
answer
to
this
observation;
for
indeed
her
heart
was
troubled,
and
to
her
eyes
she
would
have
raised
her
handkerchief
if
she
had
dared.
If
she
had
dared,
too,
she
would
have
declared
how
the
very
flowers
in
the
garden
of
Hollow's
Cottage
were
dear
to
her;
how
the
little
parlour
of
that
house
was
her
earthly
paradise;
how
she
longed
to
return
to
it,
as
much
almost
as
the
first
woman,
in
her
exile,
must
have
longed
to
revisit
Eden.
Not
daring,
however,
to
say
these
things,
she
held
her
peace;
she
sat
quiet
at
Robert's
side,
waiting
for
him
to
say
something
more.
It
was
long
since
this
proximity
had
been
hers
long
since
his
voice
had
addressed
her;
could
she,
with
any
show
of
probability,
even
of
possibility,
have
imagined
that
the
meeting
gave
him
pleasure,
to
her
it
would
have
given
deep
bliss.
Yet,
even
in
doubt
that
it
pleased,
in
dread
that
it
might
annoy
him,
she
received
the
boon
of
the
meeting
as
an
imprisoned
bird
would
the
admission
of
sunshine
to
its
cage.
It
was
of
no
use
arguing,
contending
against
the
sense
of
present
happiness;
to
be
near
Robert
was
to
be
revived.
Miss
Keeldar
laid
down
the
papers.
"And
are
you
glad
or
sad
for
all
these
menacing
tidings?"
she
inquired
of
her
tenant.
"Not
precisely
either;
but
I
certainly
am
instructed.
I
see
that
our
only
plan
is
to
be
firm.
I
see
that
efficient
preparation
and
a
resolute
attitude
are
the
best
means
of
averting
bloodshed."
He
then
inquired
if
she
had
observed
some
particular
paragraph,
to
which
she
replied
in
the
