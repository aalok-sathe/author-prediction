all
those
gentlemen
gather
round
you?
Put
away
reserve
for
once.
Be
frank
with
me."
"Who
can
resist
you?
I
will
be
frank.
To
morrow,
if
there
is
anything
to
relate,
you
shall
hear
it."
"Just
now,"
pleaded
Shirley;
"don't
procrastinate."
"But
I
could
only
tell
half
a
tale.
And
my
time
is
limited;
I
have
not
a
moment
to
spare.
Hereafter
I
will
make
amends
for
delay
by
candour."
"But
are
you
going
home?"
"Yes."
"Not
to
leave
it
any
more
to
night?"
"Certainly
not.
At
present,
farewell
to
both
of
you."
He
would
have
taken
Caroline's
hand
and
joined
it
in
the
same
clasp
in
which
he
held
Shirley's,
but
somehow
it
was
not
ready
for
him.
She
had
withdrawn
a
few
steps
apart.
Her
answer
to
Moore's
adieu
was
only
a
slight
bend
of
the
head
and
a
gentle,
serious
smile.
He
sought
no
more
cordial
token.
Again
he
said
"Farewell,"
and
quitted
them
both.
"There!
it
is
over,"
said
Shirley
when
he
was
gone.
"We
have
made
him
bid
us
good
night,
and
yet
not
lost
ground
in
his
esteem,
I
think,
Cary."
"I
hope
not,"
was
the
brief
reply.
"I
consider
you
very
timid
and
undemonstrative,"
remarked
Miss
Keeldar.
"Why
did
you
not
give
Moore
your
hand
when
he
offered
you
his?
He
is
your
cousin;
you
like
him.
Are
you
ashamed
to
let
him
perceive
your
affection?"
"He
perceives
all
of
it
that
interests
him.
No
need
to
make
a
display
of
feeling."
"You
are
laconic;
you
would
be
stoical
if
you
could.
Is
love,
in
your
eyes,
a
crime,
Caroline?"
"Love
a
crime!
No,
Shirley;
love
is
a
divine
virtue.
But
why
drag
that
word
into
the
conversation?
It
is
singularly
irrelevant."
"Good!"
pronounced
Shirley.
The
two
girls
paced
the
green
lane
in
silence.
Caroline
first
resumed.
"Obtrusiveness
is
a
crime,
forwardness
is
a
crime,
and
both
disgust;
but
love!
no
purest
angel
need
blush
to
love.
And
when
I
see
or
hear
either
man
or
woman
couple
shame
with
love,
I
know
their
minds
are
coarse,
their
associations
debased.
Many
who
think
themselves
refined
ladies
and
gentlemen,
and
on
whose
lips
the
word
'vulgarity'
is
for
ever
hovering,
cannot
mention
'love'
without
betraying
their
own
innate
and
imbecile
degradation.
It
is
a
low
feeling
in
their
estimation,
connected
only
with
low
ideas
for
them."
"You
describe
three
fourths
of
the
world,
Caroline."
"They
are
cold
they
are
cowardly
they
are
stupid
on
the
subject,
Shirley!
They
never
loved
they
never
were
loved!"
"Thou
art
right,
Lina.
And
in
their
dense
ignorance
they
blaspheme
living
fire,
seraph
brought
from
a
divine
altar."
"They
confound
it
with
sparks
mounting
from
Tophet."
The
sudden
and
joyous
clash
of
bells
here
stopped
the
dialogue
by
summoning
all
to
the
church.
INTRODUCED.
The
evening
was
still
and
warm;
close
and
sultry
it
even
promised
to
become.
Round
the
descending
sun
the
clouds
glowed
purple;
summer
tints,
rather
Indian
than
English,
suffused
the
horizon,
and
cast
rosy
reflections
