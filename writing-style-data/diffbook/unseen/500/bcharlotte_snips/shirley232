walls?"
"To
night
I
can."
"You
are
afraid
of
hedges,
and
the
beck
which
we
shall
be
forced
to
cross?"
"I
can
cross
it."
They
started;
they
ran.
Many
a
wall
checked
but
did
not
baffle
them.
Shirley
was
surefooted
and
agile;
she
could
spring
like
a
deer
when
she
chose.
Caroline,
more
timid
and
less
dexterous,
fell
once
or
twice,
and
bruised
herself;
but
she
rose
again
directly,
saying
she
was
not
hurt.
A
quickset
hedge
bounded
the
last
field;
they
lost
time
in
seeking
a
gap
in
it.
The
aperture,
when
found,
was
narrow,
but
they
worked
their
way
through.
The
long
hair,
the
tender
skin,
the
silks
and
the
muslins
suffered;
but
what
was
chiefly
regretted
was
the
impediment
this
difficulty
had
caused
to
speed.
On
the
other
side
they
met
the
beck,
flowing
deep
in
a
rough
bed.
At
this
point
a
narrow
plank
formed
the
only
bridge
across
it.
Shirley
had
trodden
the
plank
successfully
and
fearlessly
many
a
time
before;
Caroline
had
never
yet
dared
to
risk
the
transit.
"I
will
carry
you
across,"
said
Miss
Keeldar.
"You
are
light,
and
I
am
not
weak.
Let
me
try."
"If
I
fall
in,
you
may
fish
me
out,"
was
the
answer,
as
a
grateful
squeeze
compressed
her
hand.
Caroline,
without
pausing,
trod
forward
on
the
trembling
plank
as
if
it
were
a
continuation
of
the
firm
turf.
Shirley,
who
followed,
did
not
cross
it
more
resolutely
or
safely.
In
their
present
humour,
on
their
present
errand,
a
strong
and
foaming
channel
would
have
been
a
barrier
to
neither.
At
the
moment
they
were
above
the
control
either
of
fire
or
water.
All
Stilbro'
Moor,
alight
and
aglow
with
bonfires,
would
not
have
stopped
them,
nor
would
Calder
or
Aire
thundering
in
flood.
Yet
one
sound
made
them
pause.
Scarce
had
they
set
foot
on
the
solid
opposite
bank
when
a
shot
split
the
air
from
the
north.
One
second
elapsed.
Further
off
burst
a
like
note
in
the
south.
Within
the
space
of
three
minutes
similar
signals
boomed
in
the
east
and
west.
"I
thought
we
were
dead
at
the
first
explosion,"
observed
Shirley,
drawing
a
long
breath.
"I
felt
myself
hit
in
the
temples,
and
I
concluded
your
heart
was
pierced;
but
the
reiterated
voice
was
an
explanation.
Those
are
signals
it
is
their
way
the
attack
must
be
near.
We
should
have
had
wings.
Our
feet
have
not
borne
us
swiftly
enough."
A
portion
of
the
copse
was
now
to
clear.
When
they
emerged
from
it
the
mill
lay
just
below
them.
They
could
look
down
upon
the
buildings,
the
yard;
they
could
see
the
road
beyond.
And
the
first
glance
in
that
direction
told
Shirley
she
was
right
in
her
conjecture.
They
were
already
too
late
to
give
warning.
It
had
taken
more
time
than
they
calculated
on
to
overcome
the
various
obstacles
which
embarrassed
the
short
cut
across
the
fields.
The
road,
which
should
have
been
white,
was
dark
with
a
