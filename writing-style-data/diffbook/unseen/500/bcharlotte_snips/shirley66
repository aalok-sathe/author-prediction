read
it
in
his
usual
nasal
voice,
clear,
loud,
and
monotonous.
The
rite
over,
his
niece,
according
to
her
wont,
stepped
up
to
him.
"Good
night,
uncle."
"Hey!
You've
been
gadding
abroad
all
day
visiting,
dining
out,
and
what
not!"
"Only
at
the
cottage."
"And
have
you
learned
your
lessons?"
"Yes."
"And
made
a
shirt?"
"Only
part
of
one."
"Well,
that
will
do.
Stick
to
the
needle,
learn
shirt
making
and
gown
making
and
piecrust
making,
and
you'll
be
a
clever
woman
some
day.
Go
to
bed
now.
I'm
busy
with
a
pamphlet
here."
Presently
the
niece
was
enclosed
in
her
small
bedroom,
the
door
bolted,
her
white
dressing
gown
assumed,
her
long
hair
loosened
and
falling
thick,
soft,
and
wavy
to
her
waist;
and
as,
resting
from
the
task
of
combing
it
out,
she
leaned
her
check
on
her
hand
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
carpet,
before
her
rose,
and
close
around
her
drew,
the
visions
we
see
at
eighteen
years.
Her
thoughts
were
speaking
with
her,
speaking
pleasantly,
as
it
seemed,
for
she
smiled
as
she
listened.
She
looked
pretty
meditating
thus;
but
a
brighter
thing
than
she
was
in
that
apartment
the
spirit
of
youthful
Hope.
According
to
this
flattering
prophet,
she
was
to
know
disappointment,
to
feel
chill
no
more;
she
had
entered
on
the
dawn
of
a
summer
day
no
false
dawn,
but
the
true
spring
of
morning
and
her
sun
would
quickly
rise.
Impossible
for
her
now
to
suspect
that
she
was
the
sport
of
delusion;
her
expectations
seemed
warranted,
the
foundation
on
which
they
rested
appeared
solid.
"When
people
love,
the
next
step
is
they
marry,"
was
her
argument.
"Now,
I
love
Robert,
and
I
feel
sure
that
Robert
loves
me.
I
have
thought
so
many
a
time
before;
to
day
I
felt
it.
When
I
looked
up
at
him
after
repeating
Chenier's
poem,
his
eyes
(what
handsome
eyes
he
has!)
sent
the
truth
through
my
heart.
Sometimes
I
am
afraid
to
speak
to
him,
lest
I
should
be
too
frank,
lest
I
should
seem
forward
for
I
have
more
than
once
regretted
bitterly
overflowing,
superfluous
words,
and
feared
I
had
said
more
than
he
expected
me
to
say,
and
that
he
would
disapprove
what
he
might
deem
my
indiscretion;
now,
to
night
I
could
have
ventured
to
express
any
thought,
he
was
so
indulgent.
How
kind
he
was
as
we
walked
up
the
lane!
He
does
not
flatter
or
say
foolish
things;
his
love
making
(friendship,
I
mean;
of
course
I
don't
yet
account
him
my
lover,
but
I
hope
he
will
be
so
some
day)
is
not
like
what
we
read
of
in
books,
it
is
far
better
original,
quiet,
manly,
sincere.
I
do
like
him;
I
would
be
an
excellent
wife
to
him
if
he
did
marry
me;
I
would
tell
him
of
his
faults
(for
he
has
a
few
faults),
but
I
would
study
his
comfort,
and
cherish
him,
and
do
my
best
to
make
him
happy.
Now,
