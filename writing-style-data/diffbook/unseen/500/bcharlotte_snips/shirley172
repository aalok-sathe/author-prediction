outline
of
your
form."
"I
wonder
I
never
encountered
you.
I
occasionally
walk
to
the
top
of
the
Hollow's
fields
after
sunset."
"I
know
you
do.
I
had
almost
spoken
to
you
one
night,
you
passed
so
near
me."
"Did
I?
I
passed
near
you,
and
did
not
see
you!
Was
I
alone?"
"I
saw
you
twice,
and
neither
time
were
you
alone."
"Who
was
my
companion?
Probably
nothing
but
Joe
Scott,
or
my
own
shadow
by
moonlight."
"No;
neither
Joe
Scott
nor
your
shadow,
Robert.
The
first
time
you
were
with
Mr.
Yorke;
and
the
second
time
what
you
call
your
shadow
was
a
shape
with
a
white
forehead
and
dark
curls,
and
a
sparkling
necklace
round
its
neck.
But
I
only
just
got
a
glimpse
of
you
and
that
fairy
shadow;
I
did
not
wait
to
hear
you
converse."
"It
appears
you
walk
invisible.
I
noticed
a
ring
on
your
hand
this
evening;
can
it
be
the
ring
of
Gyges?
Henceforth,
when
sitting
in
the
counting
house
by
myself,
perhaps
at
dead
of
night,
I
shall
permit
myself
to
imagine
that
Caroline
may
be
leaning
over
my
shoulder
reading
with
me
from
the
same
book,
or
sitting
at
my
side
engaged
in
her
own
particular
task,
and
now
and
then
raising
her
unseen
eyes
to
my
face
to
read
there
my
thoughts."
"You
need
fear
no
such
infliction.
I
do
not
come
near
you;
I
only
stand
afar
off,
watching
what
may
become
of
you."
"When
I
walk
out
along
the
hedgerows
in
the
evening
after
the
mill
is
shut,
or
at
night
when
I
take
the
watchman's
place,
I
shall
fancy
the
flutter
of
every
little
bird
over
its
nest,
the
rustle
of
every
leaf,
a
movement
made
by
you;
tree
shadows
will
take
your
shape;
in
the
white
sprays
of
hawthorn
I
shall
imagine
glimpses
of
you.
Lina,
you
will
haunt
me."
"I
will
never
be
where
you
would
not
wish
me
to
be,
nor
see
nor
hear
what
you
would
wish
unseen
and
unheard."
"I
shall
see
you
in
my
very
mill
in
broad
daylight.
Indeed,
I
have
seen
you
there
once.
But
a
week
ago
I
was
standing
at
the
top
of
one
of
my
long
rooms;
girls
were
working
at
the
other
end,
and
amongst
half
a
dozen
of
them,
moving
to
and
fro,
I
seemed
to
see
a
figure
resembling
yours.
It
was
some
effect
of
doubtful
light
or
shade,
or
of
dazzling
sunbeam.
I
walked
up
to
this
group.
What
I
sought
had
glided
away;
I
found
myself
between
two
buxom
lasses
in
pinafores."
"I
shall
not
follow
you
into
your
mill,
Robert,
unless
you
call
me
there."
"Nor
is
that
the
only
occasion
on
which
imagination
has
played
me
a
trick.
One
night,
when
I
came
home
late
from
market,
I
walked
into
the
cottage
parlour
thinking
to
find
Hortense;
but
instead
of
her
I
thought
I
found
you.
There
was
no
candle
in
the
room;
my
sister
had
taken
