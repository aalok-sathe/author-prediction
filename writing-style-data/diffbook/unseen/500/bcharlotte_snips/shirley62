the
tints
of
the
dew
gem,
than
the
colour
or
form
of
the
sunset
cloud,
than
the
fleeting
and
glittering
ripple
varying
the
flow
of
a
rivulet.
Coriolanus
in
glory,
Coriolanus
in
disaster,
Coriolanus
banished,
followed
like
giant
shades
one
after
the
other.
Before
the
vision
of
the
banished
man
Moore's
spirit
seemed
to
pause.
He
stood
on
the
hearth
of
Aufidius's
hall,
facing
the
image
of
greatness
fallen,
but
greater
than
ever
in
that
low
estate.
He
saw
"the
grim
appearance,"
the
dark
face
"bearing
command
in
it,"
"the
noble
vessel
with
its
tackle
torn."
With
the
revenge
of
Caius
Marcius,
Moore
perfectly
sympathized;
he
was
not
scandalized
by
it;
and
again
Caroline
whispered,
"There
I
see
another
glimpse
of
brotherhood
in
error."
The
march
on
Rome,
the
mother's
supplication,
the
long
resistance,
the
final
yielding
of
bad
passions
to
good,
which
ever
must
be
the
case
in
a
nature
worthy
the
epithet
of
noble,
the
rage
of
Aufidius
at
what
he
considered
his
ally's
weakness,
the
death
of
Coriolanus,
the
final
sorrow
of
his
great
enemy
all
scenes
made
of
condensed
truth
and
strength
came
on
in
succession
and
carried
with
them
in
their
deep,
fast
flow
the
heart
and
mind
of
reader
and
listener.
"Now,
have
you
felt
Shakespeare?"
asked
Caroline,
some
ten
minutes
after
her
cousin
had
closed
the
book.
"I
think
so."
"And
have
you
felt
anything
in
Coriolanus
like
you?"
"Perhaps
I
have."
"Was
he
not
faulty
as
well
as
great?"
Moore
nodded.
"And
what
was
his
fault?
What
made
him
hated
by
the
citizens?
What
caused
him
to
be
banished
by
his
countrymen?"
"What
do
you
think
it
was?"
"I
ask
again
'Whether
was
it
pride,
Which
out
of
daily
fortune
ever
taints
The
happy
man?
whether
defect
of
judgment,
To
fail
in
the
disposing
of
those
chances
Which
he
was
lord
of?
or
whether
nature,
Not
to
be
other
than
one
thing,
not
moving
From
the
casque
to
the
cushion,
but
commanding
peace
Even
with
the
same
austerity
and
garb
As
he
controlled
the
war?'"
"Well,
answer
yourself,
Sphinx."
"It
was
a
spice
of
all;
and
you
must
not
be
proud
to
your
workpeople;
you
must
not
neglect
chances
of
soothing
them;
and
you
must
not
be
of
an
inflexible
nature,
uttering
a
request
as
austerely
as
if
it
were
a
command."
"That
is
the
moral
you
tack
to
the
play.
What
puts
such
notions
into
your
head?"
"A
wish
for
your
good,
a
care
for
your
safety,
dear
Robert,
and
a
fear,
caused
by
many
things
which
I
have
heard
lately,
that
you
will
come
to
harm."
"Who
tells
you
these
things?"
"I
hear
my
uncle
talk
about
you.
He
praises
your
hard
spirit,
your
determined
cast
of
mind,
your
scorn
of
low
enemies,
your
resolution
not
'to
truckle
to
the
mob,'
as
he
says."
"And
would
you
have
me
truckle
to
them?"
"No,
not
for
the
world.
I
never
wish
you
to
lower
yourself;
but
somehow
I
cannot
help
thinking
