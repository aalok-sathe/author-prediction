they
were,
they
had
too
much
of
our
own
English
sensibility
to
be
guilty
of
the
coarse
error.
They
stood
round
her
still,
civil,
friendly,
receiving
her
slight
smiles
and
rather
hurried
efforts
to
converse
with
a
good
feeling
and
good
breeding
the
last
quality
being
the
result
of
the
first
which
soon
set
her
at
her
ease.
Mr.
Sam
Wynne
coming
up
with
great
haste,
to
insist
on
the
elder
girls
joining
in
the
game
as
well
as
the
younger
ones,
Caroline
was
again
left
alone.
She
was
meditating
a
quiet
retreat
to
the
house,
when
Shirley,
perceiving
from
afar
her
isolation,
hastened
to
her
side.
"Let
us
go
to
the
top
of
the
fields,"
she
said.
"I
know
you
don't
like
crowds,
Caroline."
"But
it
will
be
depriving
you
of
a
pleasure,
Shirley,
to
take
you
from
all
these
fine
people,
who
court
your
society
so
assiduously,
and
to
whom
you
can,
without
art
or
effort,
make
yourself
so
pleasant."
"Not
quite
without
effort;
I
am
already
tired
of
the
exertion.
It
is
but
insipid,
barren
work,
talking
and
laughing
with
the
good
gentlefolks
of
Briarfield.
I
have
been
looking
out
for
your
white
dress
for
the
last
ten
minutes.
I
like
to
watch
those
I
love
in
a
crowd,
and
to
compare
them
with
others.
I
have
thus
compared
you.
You
resemble
none
of
the
rest,
Lina.
There
are
some
prettier
faces
than
yours
here.
You
are
not
a
model
beauty
like
Harriet
Sykes,
for
instance
beside
her
your
person
appears
almost
insignificant
but
you
look
agreeable,
you
look
reflective,
you
look
what
I
call
interesting."
"Hush,
Shirley!
you
flatter
me."
"I
don't
wonder
that
your
scholars
like
you."
"Nonsense,
Shirley!
Talk
of
something
else."
"We
will
talk
of
Moore,
then,
and
we
will
watch
him.
I
see
him
even
now."
"Where?"
And
as
Caroline
asked
the
question
she
looked
not
over
the
fields,
but
into
Miss
Keeldar's
eyes,
as
was
her
wont
whenever
Shirley
mentioned
any
object
she
descried
afar.
Her
friend
had
quicker
vision
than
herself,
and
Caroline
seemed
to
think
that
the
secret
of
her
eagle
acuteness
might
be
read
in
her
dark
gray
irides,
or
rather,
perhaps,
she
only
sought
guidance
by
the
direction
of
those
discriminating
and
brilliant
spheres.
"There
is
Moore,"
said
Shirley,
pointing
right
across
the
wide
field
where
a
thousand
children
were
playing,
and
now
nearly
a
thousand
adult
spectators
walking
about.
"There
can
you
miss
the
tall
stature
and
straight
port?
He
looks
amidst
the
set
that
surround
him
like
Eliab
amongst
humbler
shepherds
like
Saul
in
a
war
council;
and
a
war
council
it
is,
if
I
am
not
mistaken."
"Why
so,
Shirley?"
asked
Caroline,
whose
eye
had
at
last
caught
the
object
it
sought.
"Robert
is
just
now
speaking
to
my
uncle,
and
they
are
shaking
hands.
They
are
then
reconciled."
"Reconciled
not
without
good
reason,
depend
on
it
making
common
cause
against
some
common
foe.
And
why,
think
you,
are
Messrs.
Wynne
and
Sykes,
and
