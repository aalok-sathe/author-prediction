the
walk.
"He
is
not
ugly,
Shirley,"
pleaded
Caroline;
"he
is
not
ignoble.
He
is
sad;
silence
seals
his
mind.
But
I
believe
him
to
be
intelligent;
and
be
certain,
if
he
had
not
something
very
commendable
in
his
disposition,
Mr.
Hall
would
never
seek
his
society
as
he
does."
Shirley
laughed;
she
laughed
again,
each
time
with
a
slightly
sarcastic
sound.
"Well,
well,"
was
her
comment.
"On
the
plea
of
the
man
being
Cyril
Hall's
friend
and
Robert
Moore's
brother,
we'll
just
tolerate
his
existence;
won't
we,
Cary?
You
believe
him
to
be
intelligent,
do
you?
Not
quite
an
idiot
eh?
Something
commendable
in
his
disposition!
id
est,
not
an
absolute
ruffian.
Good!
Your
representations
have
weight
with
me;
and
to
prove
that
they
have,
should
he
come
this
way
I
will
speak
to
him."
He
approached
the
summer
house.
Unconscious
that
it
was
tenanted,
he
sat
down
on
the
step.
Tartar,
now
his
customary
companion,
had
followed
him,
and
he
couched
across
his
feet.
"Old
boy!"
said
Louis,
pulling
his
tawny
ear,
or
rather
the
mutilated
remains
of
that
organ,
torn
and
chewed
in
a
hundred
battles,
"the
autumn
sun
shines
as
pleasantly
on
us
as
on
the
fairest
and
richest.
This
garden
is
none
of
ours,
but
we
enjoy
its
greenness
and
perfume,
don't
we?"
He
sat
silent,
still
caressing
Tartar,
who
slobbered
with
exceeding
affection.
A
faint
twittering
commenced
among
the
trees
round.
Something
fluttered
down
as
light
as
leaves.
They
were
little
birds,
which,
lighting
on
the
sward
at
shy
distance,
hopped
as
if
expectant.
"The
small
brown
elves
actually
remember
that
I
fed
them
the
other
day,"
again
soliloquized
Louis.
"They
want
some
more
biscuit.
To
day
I
forgot
to
save
a
fragment.
Eager
little
sprites,
I
have
not
a
crumb
for
you."
He
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
drew
it
out
empty.
"A
want
easily
supplied,"
whispered
the
listening
Miss
Keeldar.
She
took
from
her
reticule
a
morsel
of
sweet
cake;
for
that
repository
was
never
destitute
of
something
available
to
throw
to
the
chickens,
young
ducks,
or
sparrows.
She
crumbled
it,
and
bending
over
his
shoulder,
put
the
crumbs
into
his
hand.
"There,"
said
she
"there
is
a
providence
for
the
improvident."
"This
September
afternoon
is
pleasant,"
observed
Louis
Moore,
as,
not
at
all
discomposed,
he
calmly
cast
the
crumbs
on
to
the
grass.
"Even
for
you?"
"As
pleasant
for
me
as
for
any
monarch."
"You
take
a
sort
of
harsh,
solitary
triumph
in
drawing
pleasure
out
of
the
elements
and
the
inanimate
and
lower
animate
creation."
"Solitary,
but
not
harsh.
With
animals
I
feel
I
am
Adam's
son,
the
heir
of
him
to
whom
dominion
was
given
over
'every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth.'
Your
dog
likes
and
follows
me.
When
I
go
into
that
yard,
the
pigeons
from
your
dovecot
flutter
at
my
feet.
Your
mare
in
the
stable
knows
me
as
well
as
it
knows
you,
and
obeys
me
better."
"And
my
roses
smell
sweet
