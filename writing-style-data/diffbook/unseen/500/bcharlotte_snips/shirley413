Mine
it
shall
not
be
to
accept
a
savage
girl
as
a
slave
she
could
not
be
a
wife.
I
know
no
white
woman
whom
I
love
that
would
accompany
me;
but
I
am
certain
Liberty
will
await
me,
sitting
under
a
pine.
When
I
call
her
she
will
come
to
my
loghouse,
and
she
shall
fill
my
arms.'
"She
could
not
hear
me
speak
so
unmoved,
and
she
was
moved.
It
was
right
I
meant
to
move
her.
She
could
not
answer
me,
nor
could
she
look
at
me.
I
should
have
been
sorry
if
she
could
have
done
either.
Her
cheek
glowed
as
if
a
crimson
flower
through
whose
petals
the
sun
shone
had
cast
its
light
upon
it.
On
the
white
lid
and
dark
lashes
of
her
downcast
eye
trembled
all
that
is
graceful
in
the
sense
of
half
painful,
half
pleasing
shame.
"Soon
she
controlled
her
emotion,
and
took
all
her
feelings
under
command.
I
saw
she
had
felt
insurrection,
and
was
waking
to
empire.
She
sat
down.
There
was
that
in
her
face
which
I
could
read.
It
said,
I
see
the
line
which
is
my
limit;
nothing
shall
make
me
pass
it.
I
feel
I
know
how
far
I
may
reveal
my
feelings,
and
when
I
must
clasp
the
volume.
I
have
advanced
to
a
certain
distance,
as
far
as
the
true
and
sovereign
and
undegraded
nature
of
my
kind
permits;
now
here
I
stand
rooted.
My
heart
may
break
if
it
is
baffled;
let
it
break.
It
shall
never
dishonour
me;
it
shall
never
dishonour
my
sisterhood
in
me.
Suffering
before
degradation!
death
before
treachery!
"I,
for
my
part,
said,
'If
she
were
poor,
I
would
be
at
her
feet;
if
she
were
lowly,
I
would
take
her
in
my
arms.
Her
gold
and
her
station
are
two
griffins
that
guard
her
on
each
side.
Love
looks
and
longs,
and
dares
not;
Passion
hovers
round,
and
is
kept
at
bay;
Truth
and
Devotion
are
scared.
There
is
nothing
to
lose
in
winning
her,
no
sacrifice
to
make.
It
is
all
clear
gain,
and
therefore
unimaginably
difficult.'
"Difficult
or
not,
something
must
be
done,
something
must
be
said.
I
could
not,
and
would
not,
sit
silent
with
all
that
beauty
modestly
mute
in
my
presence.
I
spoke
thus,
and
still
I
spoke
with
calm.
Quiet
as
my
words
were,
I
could
hear
they
fell
in
a
tone
distinct,
round,
and
deep.
"'Still,
I
know
I
shall
be
strangely
placed
with
that
mountain
nymph
Liberty.
She
is,
I
suspect,
akin
to
that
Solitude
which
I
once
wooed,
and
from
which
I
now
seek
a
divorce.
These
Oreads
are
peculiar.
They
come
upon
you
with
an
unearthly
charm,
like
some
starlight
evening;
they
inspire
a
wild
but
not
warm
delight;
their
beauty
is
the
beauty
of
spirits;
their
grace
is
not
the
grace
of
life,
but
of
seasons
or
scenes
in
nature.
Theirs
is
the
dewy
bloom
of
morning,
the
languid
flush
of
evening,
the
peace
