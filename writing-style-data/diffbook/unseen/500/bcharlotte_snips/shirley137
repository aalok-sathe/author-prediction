earnest.
Let
us
have
a
confession
of
faith
on
the
spot."
And
he
took
the
heiress's
two
hands
causing
her
to
let
fall
her
whole
cargo
of
flowers
and
seated
her
by
him
on
the
sofa.
"Say
your
creed,"
he
ordered.
"The
Apostles'
Creed?"
"Yes."
She
said
it
like
a
child.
"Now
for
St.
Athanasius's.
That's
the
test!"
"Let
me
gather
up
my
flowers.
Here
is
Tartar
coming;
he
will
tread
upon
them."
Tartar
was
a
rather
large,
strong,
and
fierce
looking
dog,
very
ugly,
being
of
a
breed
between
mastiff
and
bulldog,
who
at
this
moment
entered
through
the
glass
door,
and
posting
directly
to
the
rug,
snuffed
the
fresh
flowers
scattered
there.
He
seemed
to
scorn
them
as
food;
but
probably
thinking
their
velvety
petals
might
be
convenient
as
litter,
he
was
turning
round
preparatory
to
depositing
his
tawny
bulk
upon
them,
when
Miss
Helstone
and
Miss
Keeldar
simultaneously
stooped
to
the
rescue.
"Thank
you,"
said
the
heiress,
as
she
again
held
out
her
little
apron
for
Caroline
to
heap
the
blossoms
into
it.
"Is
this
your
daughter,
Mr.
Helstone?"
she
asked.
"My
niece
Caroline."
Miss
Keeldar
shook
hands
with
her,
and
then
looked
at
her.
Caroline
also
looked
at
her
hostess.
Shirley
Keeldar
(she
had
no
Christian
name
but
Shirley:
her
parents,
who
had
wished
to
have
a
son,
finding
that,
after
eight
years
of
marriage,
Providence
had
granted
them
only
a
daughter,
bestowed
on
her
the
same
masculine
family
cognomen
they
would
have
bestowed
on
a
boy,
if
with
a
boy
they
had
been
blessed)
Shirley
Keeldar
was
no
ugly
heiress.
She
was
agreeable
to
the
eye.
Her
height
and
shape
were
not
unlike
Miss
Helstone's;
perhaps
in
stature
she
might
have
the
advantage
by
an
inch
or
two.
She
was
gracefully
made,
and
her
face,
too,
possessed
a
charm
as
well
described
by
the
word
grace
as
any
other.
It
was
pale
naturally,
but
intelligent,
and
of
varied
expression.
She
was
not
a
blonde,
like
Caroline.
Clear
and
dark
were
the
characteristics
of
her
aspect
as
to
colour.
Her
face
and
brow
were
clear,
her
eyes
of
the
darkest
gray
(no
green
lights
in
them
transparent,
pure,
neutral
gray),
and
her
hair
of
the
darkest
brown.
Her
features
were
distinguished
by
which
I
do
not
mean
that
they
were
high,
bony,
and
Roman,
being
indeed
rather
small
and
slightly
marked
than
otherwise,
but
only
that
they
were,
to
use
a
few
French
words,
"fins,
gracieux,
spirituels"
mobile
they
were
and
speaking;
but
their
changes
were
not
to
be
understood
nor
their
language
interpreted
all
at
once.
She
examined
Caroline
seriously,
inclining
her
head
a
little
to
one
side,
with
a
thoughtful
air.
"You
see
she
is
only
a
feeble
chick,"
observed
Mr.
Helstone.
"She
looks
young
younger
than
I.
How
old
are
you?"
she
inquired
in
a
manner
that
would
have
been
patronizing
if
it
had
not
been
extremely
solemn
and
simple.
"Eighteen
years
and
six
months."
"And
I
am
twenty
one."
She
said
no
