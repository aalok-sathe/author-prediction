built
ere
that
highway
was
cut,
and
when
a
lane
winding
up
through
fields
was
the
only
path
conducting
to
it.
Briarfield
lay
scarce
a
mile
off;
its
hum
was
heard,
its
glare
distinctly
seen.
Briar
Chapel,
a
large,
new,
raw
Wesleyan
place
of
worship,
rose
but
a
hundred
yards
distant;
and
as
there
was
even
now
a
prayer
meeting
being
held
within
its
walls,
the
illumination
of
its
windows
cast
a
bright
reflection
on
the
road,
while
a
hymn
of
a
most
extraordinary
description,
such
as
a
very
Quaker
might
feel
himself
moved
by
the
Spirit
to
dance
to,
roused
cheerily
all
the
echoes
of
the
vicinage.
The
words
were
distinctly
audible
by
snatches.
Here
is
a
quotation
or
two
from
different
strains;
for
the
singers
passed
jauntily
from
hymn
to
hymn
and
from
tune
to
tune,
with
an
ease
and
buoyancy
all
their
own:
"Oh!
who
can
explain
This
struggle
for
life,
This
travail
and
pain,
This
trembling
and
strife?
Plague,
earthquake,
and
famine,
And
tumult
and
war,
The
wonderful
coming
Of
Jesus
declare!
"For
every
fight
Is
dreadful
and
loud:
The
warrior's
delight
Is
slaughter
and
blood,
His
foes
overturning,
Till
all
shall
expire:
And
this
is
with
burning,
And
fuel,
and
fire!"
Here
followed
an
interval
of
clamorous
prayer,
accompanied
by
fearful
groans.
A
shout
of
"I've
found
liberty!"
"Doad
o'
Bill's
has
fun'
liberty!"
rang
from
the
chapel,
and
out
all
the
assembly
broke
again.
"What
a
mercy
is
this!
What
a
heaven
of
bliss!
How
unspeakably
happy
am
I!
Gathered
into
the
fold,
With
Thy
people
enrolled,
With
Thy
people
to
live
and
to
die!
"Oh,
the
goodness
of
God
In
employing
a
clod
His
tribute
of
glory
to
raise;
His
standard
to
bear,
And
with
triumph
declare
His
unspeakable
riches
of
grace!
"Oh,
the
fathomless
love
That
has
deigned
to
approve
And
prosper
the
work
of
my
hands.
With
my
pastoral
crook
I
went
over
the
brook,
And
behold
I
am
spread
into
bands!
"Who,
I
ask
in
amaze,
Hath
begotten
me
these?
And
inquire
from
what
quarter
they
came.
My
full
heart
it
replies,
They
are
born
from
the
skies,
And
gives
glory
to
God
and
the
Lamb!"
The
stanza
which
followed
this,
after
another
and
longer
interregnum
of
shouts,
yells,
ejaculations,
frantic
cries,
agonized
groans,
seemed
to
cap
the
climax
of
noise
and
zeal.
"Sleeping
on
the
brink
of
sin,
Tophet
gaped
to
take
us
in;
Mercy
to
our
rescue
flew,
Broke
the
snare,
and
brought
us
through.
"Here,
as
in
a
lion's
den,
Undevoured
we
still
remain,
Pass
secure
the
watery
flood,
Hanging
on
the
arm
of
God.
"Here
"
(Terrible,
most
distracting
to
the
ear,
was
the
strained
shout
in
which
the
last
stanza
was
given.)
"Here
we
raise
our
voices
higher,
Shout
in
the
refiner's
fire,
Clap
our
hands
amidst
the
flame,
Glory
give
to
Jesus'
name!"
The
roof
of
the
chapel
did
not
fly
off,
which
speaks
volumes
in
praise
of
its
solid
slating.
But
