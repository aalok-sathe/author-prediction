were
soon
in
the
midst
of
the
company.
The
former
met
them
very
easily
for
her.
Instead
of
sitting
down
in
a
retired
corner,
or
stealing
away
to
her
own
room
till
the
procession
should
be
marshalled,
according
to
her
wont,
she
moved
through
the
three
parlours,
conversed
and
smiled,
absolutely
spoke
once
or
twice
ere
she
was
spoken
to,
and,
in
short,
seemed
a
new
creature.
It
was
Shirley's
presence
which
thus
transformed
her;
the
view
of
Miss
Keeldar's
air
and
manner
did
her
a
world
of
good.
Shirley
had
no
fear
of
her
kind,
no
tendency
to
shrink
from,
to
avoid
it.
All
human
beings
men,
women,
or
children
whom
low
breeding
or
coarse
presumption
did
not
render
positively
offensive,
were
welcome
enough
to
her
some
much
more
so
than
others,
of
course;
but,
generally
speaking,
till
a
man
had
indisputably
proved
himself
bad
and
a
nuisance,
Shirley
was
willing
to
think
him
good
and
an
acquisition,
and
to
treat
him
accordingly.
This
disposition
made
her
a
general
favourite,
for
it
robbed
her
very
raillery
of
its
sting,
and
gave
her
serious
or
smiling
conversation
a
happy
charm;
nor
did
it
diminish
the
value
of
her
intimate
friendship,
which
was
a
distinct
thing
from
this
social
benevolence
depending,
indeed,
on
quite
a
different
part
of
her
character.
Miss
Helstone
was
the
choice
of
her
affection
and
intellect;
the
Misses
Pearson,
Sykes,
Wynne,
etc.,
etc.,
only
the
profiteers
by
her
good
nature
and
vivacity.
Donne
happened
to
come
into
the
drawing
room
while
Shirley,
sitting
on
the
sofa,
formed
the
centre
of
a
tolerably
wide
circle.
She
had
already
forgotten
her
exasperation
against
him,
and
she
bowed
and
smiled
good
humouredly.
The
disposition
of
the
man
was
then
seen.
He
knew
neither
how
to
decline
the
advance
with
dignity,
as
one
whose
just
pride
has
been
wounded,
nor
how
to
meet
it
with
frankness,
as
one
who
is
glad
to
forget
and
forgive.
His
punishment
had
impressed
him
with
no
sense
of
shame,
and
he
did
not
experience
that
feeling
on
encountering
his
chastiser.
He
was
not
vigorous
enough
in
evil
to
be
actively
malignant
he
merely
passed
by
sheepishly
with
a
rated,
scowling
look.
Nothing
could
ever
again
reconcile
him
to
his
enemy;
while
no
passion
of
resentment,
for
even
sharper
and
more
ignominious
inflictions,
could
his
lymphatic
nature
know.
"He
was
not
worth
a
scene!"
said
Shirley
to
Caroline.
"What
a
fool
I
was!
To
revenge
on
poor
Donne
his
silly
spite
at
Yorkshire
is
something
like
crushing
a
gnat
for
attacking
the
hide
of
a
rhinoceros.
Had
I
been
a
gentleman,
I
believe
I
should
have
helped
him
off
the
premises
by
dint
of
physical
force.
I
am
glad
now
I
only
employed
the
moral
weapon.
But
he
must
come
near
me
no
more.
I
don't
like
him.
He
irritates
me.
There
is
not
even
amusement
to
be
had
out
of
him.
Malone
is
better
sport."
It
seemed
as
if
Malone
wished
to
justify
the
preference,
