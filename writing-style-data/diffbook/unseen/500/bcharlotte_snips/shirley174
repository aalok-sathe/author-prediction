we
have
reached
the
churchyard.
Then
we
are
to
part
here,
I
suppose.
We
might
have
sat
a
few
minutes
in
the
church
porch,
if
the
girl
had
not
been
with
us.
It
is
so
fine
a
night,
so
summer
mild
and
still,
I
have
no
particular
wish
to
return
yet
to
the
Hollow."
"But
we
cannot
sit
in
the
porch
now,
Robert."
Caroline
said
this
because
Moore
was
turning
her
round
towards
it.
"Perhaps
not.
But
tell
Fanny
to
go
in.
Say
we
are
coming.
A
few
minutes
will
make
no
difference."
The
church
clock
struck
ten.
"My
uncle
will
be
coming
out
to
take
his
usual
sentinel
round,
and
he
always
surveys
the
church
and
churchyard."
"And
if
he
does?
If
it
were
not
for
Fanny,
who
knows
we
are
here,
I
should
find
pleasure
in
dodging
and
eluding
him.
We
could
be
under
the
east
window
when
he
is
at
the
porch;
as
he
came
round
to
the
north
side
we
could
wheel
off
to
the
south;
we
might
at
a
pinch
hide
behind
some
of
the
monuments.
That
tall
erection
of
the
Wynnes
would
screen
us
completely."
"Robert,
what
good
spirits
you
have!
Go!
go!"
added
Caroline
hastily.
"I
hear
the
front
door
"
"I
don't
want
to
go;
on
the
contrary,
I
want
to
stay."
"You
know
my
uncle
will
be
terribly
angry.
He
forbade
me
to
see
you
because
you
are
a
Jacobin."
"A
queer
Jacobin!"
"Go,
Robert,
he
is
coming;
I
hear
him
cough."
"Diable!
It
is
strange
what
a
pertinacious
wish
I
feel
to
stay!"
"You
remember
what
he
did
to
Fanny's
"
began
Caroline,
and
stopped
abruptly
short.
"Sweetheart"
was
the
word
that
ought
to
have
followed,
but
she
could
not
utter
it.
It
seemed
calculated
to
suggest
ideas
she
had
no
intention
to
suggest
ideas
delusive
and
disturbing.
Moore
was
less
scrupulous.
"Fanny's
sweetheart?"
he
said
at
once.
"He
gave
him
a
shower
bath
under
the
pump,
did
he
not?
He'd
do
as
much
for
me,
I
dare
say,
with
pleasure.
I
should
like
to
provoke
the
old
Turk
not,
however,
against
you.
But
he
would
make
a
distinction
between
a
cousin
and
a
lover,
would
he
not?"
"Oh,
he
would
not
think
of
you
in
that
way,
of
course
not;
his
quarrel
with
you
is
entirely
political.
Yet
I
should
not
like
the
breach
to
be
widened,
and
he
is
so
testy.
Here
he
is
at
the
garden
gate.
For
your
own
sake
and
mine,
Robert,
go!"
The
beseeching
words
were
aided
by
a
beseeching
gesture
and
a
more
beseeching
look.
Moore
covered
her
clasped
hands
an
instant
with
his,
answered
her
upward
by
a
downward
gaze,
said
"Good
night!"
and
went.
Caroline
was
in
a
moment
at
the
kitchen
door
behind
Fanny.
The
shadow
of
the
shovel
hat
at
that
very
instant
fell
on
a
moonlit
tomb.
The
rector
emerged,
erect
as
a
cane,
from
his
garden,
and
proceeded
in
slow
march,
his
hands
behind
him,
down
the
