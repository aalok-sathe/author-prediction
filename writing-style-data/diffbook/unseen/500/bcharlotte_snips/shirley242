the
housekeeper,
appeared
vainly
persuading
to
take
their
milk
cans
and
depart.
(It
is,
or
was,
by
the
bye,
the
custom
in
the
north
of
England
for
the
cottagers
on
a
country
squire's
estate
to
receive
their
supplies
of
milk
and
butter
from
the
dairy
of
the
manor
house,
on
whose
pastures
a
herd
of
milch
kine
was
usually
fed
for
the
convenience
of
the
neighbourhood.
Miss
Keeldar
owned
such
a
herd
all
deep
dewlapped,
Craven
cows,
reared
on
the
sweet
herbage
and
clear
waters
of
bonny
Airedale;
and
very
proud
she
was
of
their
sleek
aspect
and
high
condition.)
Seeing
now
the
state
of
matters,
and
that
it
was
desirable
to
effect
a
clearance
of
the
premises,
Shirley
stepped
in
amongst
the
gossiping
groups.
She
bade
them
good
morning
with
a
certain
frank,
tranquil
ease
the
natural
characteristic
of
her
manner
when
she
addressed
numbers,
especially
if
those
numbers
belonged
to
the
working
class;
she
was
cooler
amongst
her
equals,
and
rather
proud
to
those
above
her.
She
then
asked
them
if
they
had
all
got
their
milk
measured
out;
and
understanding
that
they
had,
she
further
observed
that
she
"wondered
what
they
were
waiting
for,
then."
"We're
just
talking
a
bit
over
this
battle
there
has
been
at
your
mill,
mistress,"
replied
a
man.
"Talking
a
bit!
Just
like
you!"
said
Shirley.
"It
is
a
queer
thing
all
the
world
is
so
fond
of
talking
over
events.
You
talk
if
anybody
dies
suddenly;
you
talk
if
a
fire
breaks
out;
you
talk
if
a
mill
owner
fails;
you
talk
if
he's
murdered.
What
good
does
your
talking
do?"
There
is
nothing
the
lower
orders
like
better
than
a
little
downright
good
humoured
rating.
Flattery
they
scorn
very
much;
honest
abuse
they
enjoy.
They
call
it
speaking
plainly,
and
take
a
sincere
delight
in
being
the
objects
thereof.
The
homely
harshness
of
Miss
Keeldar's
salutation
won
her
the
ear
of
the
whole
throng
in
a
second.
"We're
no
war
nor
some
'at
is
aboon
us,
are
we?"
asked
a
man,
smiling.
"Nor
a
whit
better.
You
that
should
be
models
of
industry
are
just
as
gossip
loving
as
the
idle.
Fine,
rich
people
that
have
nothing
to
do
may
be
partly
excused
for
trifling
their
time
away;
you
who
have
to
earn
your
bread
with
the
sweat
of
your
brow
are
quite
inexcusable."
"That's
queer,
mistress.
Suld
we
never
have
a
holiday
because
we
work
hard?"
"Never,"
was
the
prompt
answer;
"unless,"
added
the
"mistress,"
with
a
smile
that
half
belied
the
severity
of
her
speech
"unless
you
knew
how
to
make
a
better
use
of
it
than
to
get
together
over
rum
and
tea
if
you
are
women,
or
over
beer
and
pipes
if
you
are
men,
and
talk
scandal
at
your
neighbours'
expense.
Come,
friends,"
she
added,
changing
at
once
from
bluntness
to
courtesy,
"oblige
me
by
taking
your
cans
and
going
home.
I
expect
several
persons
to
call
to
day,
and
it
will
be
inconvenient
to
