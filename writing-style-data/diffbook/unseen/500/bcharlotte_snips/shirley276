air,
that
Robert
was
at
Whinbury.
Mrs.
Yorke
laughed
her
own
peculiar
short
laugh.
"Straightforward
Miss
Moore!"
said
she
patronizingly.
"It
is
like
you
to
understand
my
question
so
literally
and
answer
it
so
simply.
Your
mind
comprehends
nothing
of
intrigue.
Strange
things
might
go
on
around
you
without
your
being
the
wiser;
you
are
not
of
the
class
the
world
calls
sharp
witted."
These
equivocal
compliments
did
not
seem
to
please
Hortense.
She
drew
herself
up,
puckered
her
black
eyebrows,
but
still
looked
puzzled.
"I
have
ever
been
noted
for
sagacity
and
discernment
from
childhood,"
she
returned;
for,
indeed,
on
the
possession
of
these
qualities
she
peculiarly
piqued
herself.
"You
never
plotted
to
win
a
husband,
I'll
be
bound,"
pursued
Mrs.
Yorke;
"and
you
have
not
the
benefit
of
previous
experience
to
aid
you
in
discovering
when
others
plot."
Caroline
felt
this
kind
language
where
the
benevolent
speaker
intended
she
should
feel
it
in
her
very
heart.
She
could
not
even
parry
the
shafts;
she
was
defenceless
for
the
present.
To
answer
would
have
been
to
avow
that
the
cap
fitted.
Mrs.
Yorke,
looking
at
her
as
she
sat
with
troubled,
downcast
eyes,
and
cheek
burning
painfully,
and
figure
expressing
in
its
bent
attitude
and
unconscious
tremor
all
the
humiliation
and
chagrin
she
experienced,
felt
the
sufferer
was
fair
game.
The
strange
woman
had
a
natural
antipathy
to
a
shrinking,
sensitive
character
a
nervous
temperament;
nor
was
a
pretty,
delicate,
and
youthful
face
a
passport
to
her
affections.
It
was
seldom
she
met
with
all
these
obnoxious
qualities
combined
in
one
individual;
still
more
seldom
she
found
that
individual
at
her
mercy,
under
circumstances
in
which
she
could
crush
her
well.
She
happened
this
afternoon
to
be
specially
bilious
and
morose
as
much
disposed
to
gore
as
any
vicious
"mother
of
the
herd."
Lowering
her
large
head
she
made
a
new
charge.
"Your
cousin
Hortense
is
an
excellent
sister,
Miss
Helstone.
Such
ladies
as
come
to
try
their
life's
luck
here
at
Hollow's
Cottage
may,
by
a
very
little
clever
female
artifice,
cajole
the
mistress
of
the
house,
and
have
the
game
all
in
their
own
hands.
You
are
fond
of
your
cousin's
society,
I
dare
say,
miss?"
"Of
which
cousin's?"
"Oh,
of
the
lady's,
of
course."
"Hortense
is,
and
always
has
been,
most
kind
to
me."
"Every
sister
with
an
eligible
single
brother
is
considered
most
kind
by
her
spinster
friends."
"Mrs.
Yorke,"
said
Caroline,
lifting
her
eyes
slowly,
their
blue
orbs
at
the
same
time
clearing
from
trouble,
and
shining
steady
and
full,
while
the
glow
of
shame
left
her
cheek,
and
its
hue
turned
pale
and
settled
"Mrs.
Yorke,
may
I
ask
what
you
mean?"
"To
give
you
a
lesson
on
the
cultivation
of
rectitude,
to
disgust
you
with
craft
and
false
sentiment."
"Do
I
need
this
lesson?"
"Most
young
ladies
of
the
present
day
need
it.
You
are
quite
a
modern
young
lady
morbid,
delicate,
professing
to
like
retirement;
which
implies,
I
suppose,
that
you
