'Strong
against
tides,
the
enormous
whale
Emerges
as
he
goes.'"
"I
hope
our
bark
will
meet
with
no
such
shoal,
or
herd
as
you
term
it,
Caroline.
(I
suppose
you
fancy
the
sea
mammoths
pasturing
about
the
bases
of
the
'everlasting
hills,'
devouring
strange
provender
in
the
vast
valleys
through
and
above
which
sea
billows
roll.)
I
should
not
like
to
be
capsized
by
the
patriarch
bull."
"I
suppose
you
expect
to
see
mermaids,
Shirley?"
"One
of
them,
at
any
rate
I
do
not
bargain
for
less
and
she
is
to
appear
in
some
such
fashion
as
this.
I
am
to
be
walking
by
myself
on
deck,
rather
late
of
an
August
evening,
watching
and
being
watched
by
a
full
harvest
moon.
Something
is
to
rise
white
on
the
surface
of
the
sea,
over
which
that
moon
mounts
silent
and
hangs
glorious.
The
object
glitters
and
sinks.
It
rises
again.
I
think
I
hear
it
cry
with
an
articulate
voice;
I
call
you
up
from
the
cabin;
I
show
you
an
image,
fair
as
alabaster,
emerging
from
the
dim
wave.
We
both
see
the
long
hair,
the
lifted
and
foam
white
arm,
the
oval
mirror
brilliant
as
a
star.
It
glides
nearer;
a
human
face
is
plainly
visible
a
face
in
the
style
of
yours
whose
straight,
pure
(excuse
the
word,
it
is
appropriate)
whose
straight,
pure
lineaments
paleness
does
not
disfigure.
It
looks
at
us,
but
not
with
your
eyes.
I
see
a
preternatural
lure
in
its
wily
glance.
It
beckons.
Were
we
men,
we
should
spring
at
the
sign
the
cold
billow
would
be
dared
for
the
sake
of
the
colder
enchantress;
being
women,
we
stand
safe,
though
not
dreadless.
She
comprehends
our
unmoved
gaze;
she
feels
herself
powerless;
anger
crosses
her
front;
she
cannot
charm,
but
she
will
appal
us;
she
rises
high,
and
glides
all
revealed
on
the
dark
wave
ridge.
Temptress
terror!
monstrous
likeness
of
ourselves!
Are
you
not
glad,
Caroline,
when
at
last,
and
with
a
wild
shriek,
she
dives?"
"But,
Shirley,
she
is
not
like
us.
We
are
neither
temptresses,
nor
terrors,
nor
monsters."
"Some
of
our
kind,
it
is
said,
are
all
three.
There
are
men
who
ascribe
to
'woman,'
in
general,
such
attributes."
"My
dears,"
here
interrupted
Mrs.
Pryor,
"does
it
not
strike
you
that
your
conversation
for
the
last
ten
minutes
has
been
rather
fanciful?"
"But
there
is
no
harm
in
our
fancies;
is
there,
ma'am?"
"We
are
aware
that
mermaids
do
not
exist;
why
speak
of
them
as
if
they
did?
How
can
you
find
interest
in
speaking
of
a
nonentity?"
"I
don't
know,"
said
Shirley.
"My
dear,
I
think
there
is
an
arrival.
I
heard
a
step
in
the
lane
while
you
were
talking;
and
is
not
that
the
garden
gate
which
creaks?"
Shirley
stepped
to
the
window.
"Yes,
there
is
some
one,"
said
she,
turning
quietly
away;
and
as
she
resumed
her
seat
a
sensitive
flush
animated
her
face,
while
a
trembling
ray
at
once
kindled
and
