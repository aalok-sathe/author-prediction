pretty
well
repeated?"
she
inquired,
smiling
like
any
happy,
docile
child.
"I
really
don't
know."
"Why
don't
you
know?
Have
you
not
listened?"
"Yes
and
looked.
You
are
fond
of
poetry,
Lina?"
"When
I
meet
with
real
poetry,
I
cannot
rest
till
I
have
learned
it
by
heart,
and
so
made
it
partly
mine."
Mr.
Moore
now
sat
silent
for
several
minutes.
It
struck
nine
o'clock.
Sarah
entered,
and
said
that
Mr.
Helstone's
servant
was
come
for
Miss
Caroline.
"Then
the
evening
is
gone
already,"
she
observed,
"and
it
will
be
long,
I
suppose,
before
I
pass
another
here."
Hortense
had
been
for
some
time
nodding
over
her
knitting;
fallen
into
a
doze
now,
she
made
no
response
to
the
remark.
"You
would
have
no
objection
to
come
here
oftener
of
an
evening?"
inquired
Robert,
as
he
took
her
folded
mantle
from
the
side
table,
where
it
still
lay,
and
carefully
wrapped
it
round
her.
"I
like
to
come
here;
but
I
have
no
desire
to
be
intrusive.
I
am
not
hinting
to
be
asked;
you
must
understand
that."
"Oh!
I
understand
thee,
child.
You
sometimes
lecture
me
for
wishing
to
be
rich,
Lina;
but
if
I
were
rich,
you
should
live
here
always
at
any
rate,
you
should
live
with
me
wherever
my
habitation
might
be."
"That
would
be
pleasant;
and
if
you
were
poor
ever
so
poor
it
would
still
be
pleasant.
Good
night,
Robert."
"I
promised
to
walk
with
you
up
to
the
rectory."
"I
know
you
did;
but
I
thought
you
had
forgotten,
and
I
hardly
knew
how
to
remind
you,
though
I
wished
to
do
it.
But
would
you
like
to
go?
It
is
a
cold
night,
and
as
Fanny
is
come,
there
is
no
necessity
"
"Here
is
your
muff;
don't
wake
Hortense
come."
The
half
mile
to
the
rectory
was
soon
traversed.
They
parted
in
the
garden
without
kiss,
scarcely
with
a
pressure
of
hands;
yet
Robert
sent
his
cousin
in
excited
and
joyously
troubled.
He
had
been
singularly
kind
to
her
that
day
not
in
phrase,
compliment,
profession,
but
in
manner,
in
look,
and
in
soft
and
friendly
tones.
For
himself,
he
came
home
grave,
almost
morose.
As
he
stood
leaning
on
his
own
yard
gate,
musing
in
the
watery
moonlight
all
alone,
the
hushed,
dark
mill
before
him,
the
hill
environed
hollow
round,
he
exclaimed,
abruptly,
"This
won't
do!
There's
weakness
there's
downright
ruin
in
all
this.
However,"
he
added,
dropping
his
voice,
"the
frenzy
is
quite
temporary.
I
know
it
very
well;
I
have
had
it
before.
It
will
be
gone
to
morrow."
Caroline
Helstone
was
just
eighteen
years
old,
and
at
eighteen
the
true
narrative
of
life
is
yet
to
be
commenced.
Before
that
time
we
sit
listening
to
a
tale,
a
marvellous
fiction,
delightful
sometimes,
and
sad
sometimes,
almost
always
unreal.
Before
that
time
our
world
is
heroic,
its
inhabitants
half
divine
or
semi
demon;
its
scenes
are
dream
scenes;
darker
woods
and
stranger
hills,
brighter
skies,
