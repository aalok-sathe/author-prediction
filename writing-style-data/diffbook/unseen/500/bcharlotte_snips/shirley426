the
legitimate
urchin,
rude,
unwashed,
and
naughty,
you
must
stand
down.
Make
way
for
Mr.
Sweeting.
Here
he
comes,
with
his
lady
on
his
arm
the
most
splendid
and
the
weightiest
woman
in
Yorkshire
Mrs.
Sweeting,
formerly
Miss
Dora
Sykes.
They
were
married
under
the
happiest
auspices,
Mr.
Sweeting
having
been
just
inducted
to
a
comfortable
living,
and
Mr.
Sykes
being
in
circumstances
to
give
Dora
a
handsome
portion.
They
lived
long
and
happily
together,
beloved
by
their
parishioners
and
by
a
numerous
circle
of
friends.
There!
I
think
the
varnish
has
been
put
on
very
nicely.
Advance,
Mr.
Donne.
This
gentleman
turned
out
admirably
far
better
than
either
you
or
I
could
possibly
have
expected,
reader.
He,
too,
married
a
most
sensible,
quiet,
lady
like
little
woman.
The
match
was
the
making
of
him.
He
became
an
exemplary
domestic
character,
and
a
truly
active
parish
priest
(as
a
pastor
he,
to
his
dying
day,
conscientiously
refused
to
act).
The
outside
of
the
cup
and
platter
he
burnished
up
with
the
best
polishing
powder;
the
furniture
of
the
altar
and
temple
he
looked
after
with
the
zeal
of
an
upholsterer,
the
care
of
a
cabinet
maker.
His
little
school,
his
little
church,
his
little
parsonage,
all
owed
their
erection
to
him;
and
they
did
him
credit.
Each
was
a
model
in
its
way.
If
uniformity
and
taste
in
architecture
had
been
the
same
thing
as
consistency
and
earnestness
in
religion,
what
a
shepherd
of
a
Christian
flock
Mr.
Donne
would
have
made!
There
was
one
art
in
the
mastery
of
which
nothing
mortal
ever
surpassed
Mr.
Donne:
it
was
that
of
begging.
By
his
own
unassisted
efforts
he
begged
all
the
money
for
all
his
erections.
In
this
matter
he
had
a
grasp
of
plan,
a
scope
of
action
quite
unique.
He
begged
of
high
and
low
of
the
shoeless
cottage
brat
and
the
coroneted
duke.
He
sent
out
begging
letters
far
and
wide
to
old
Queen
Charlotte,
to
the
princesses
her
daughters,
to
her
sons
the
royal
dukes,
to
the
Prince
Regent,
to
Lord
Castlereagh,
to
every
member
of
the
ministry
then
in
office;
and,
what
is
more
remarkable,
he
screwed
something
out
of
every
one
of
these
personages.
It
is
on
record
that
he
got
five
pounds
from
the
close
fisted
old
lady
Queen
Charlotte,
and
two
guineas
from
the
royal
profligate
her
eldest
son.
When
Mr.
Donne
set
out
on
begging
expeditions,
he
armed
himself
in
a
complete
suit
of
brazen
mail.
That
you
had
given
a
hundred
pounds
yesterday
was
with
him
no
reason
why
you
should
not
give
two
hundred
to
day.
He
would
tell
you
so
to
your
face,
and,
ten
to
one,
get
the
money
out
of
you.
People
gave
to
get
rid
of
him.
After
all,
he
did
some
good
with
the
cash.
He
was
useful
in
his
day
and
generation.
Perhaps
I
ought
to
remark
that
on
the
premature
and
sudden
vanishing
of
Mr.
Malone
from
the
stage
of
Briarfield
parish
