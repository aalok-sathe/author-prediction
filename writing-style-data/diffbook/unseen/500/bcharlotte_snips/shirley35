his
stay.
His
wife,
after
a
year
or
two,
was
of
no
great
importance
to
him
in
any
shape;
and
when
she
one
day,
as
he
thought,
suddenly
for
he
had
scarcely
noticed
her
decline
but,
as
others
thought,
gradually,
took
her
leave
of
him
and
of
life,
and
there
was
only
a
still,
beautiful
featured
mould
of
clay
left,
cold
and
white,
in
the
conjugal
couch,
he
felt
his
bereavement
who
shall
say
how
little?
Yet,
perhaps,
more
than
he
seemed
to
feel
it;
for
he
was
not
a
man
from
whom
grief
easily
wrung
tears.
His
dry
eyed
and
sober
mourning
scandalized
an
old
housekeeper,
and
likewise
a
female
attendant,
who
had
waited
upon
Mrs.
Helstone
in
her
sickness,
and
who,
perhaps,
had
had
opportunities
of
learning
more
of
the
deceased
lady's
nature,
of
her
capacity
for
feeling
and
loving,
than
her
husband
knew.
They
gossiped
together
over
the
corpse,
related
anecdotes,
with
embellishments
of
her
lingering
decline,
and
its
real
or
supposed
cause.
In
short,
they
worked
each
other
up
to
some
indignation
against
the
austere
little
man,
who
sat
examining
papers
in
an
adjoining
room,
unconscious
of
what
opprobrium
he
was
the
object.
Mrs.
Helstone
was
hardly
under
the
sod
when
rumours
began
to
be
rife
in
the
neighbourhood
that
she
had
died
of
a
broken
heart.
These
magnified
quickly
into
reports
of
hard
usage,
and,
finally,
details
of
harsh
treatment
on
the
part
of
her
husband
reports
grossly
untrue,
but
not
the
less
eagerly
received
on
that
account.
Mr.
Yorke
heard
them,
partly
believed
them.
Already,
of
course,
he
had
no
friendly
feeling
to
his
successful
rival.
Though
himself
a
married
man
now,
and
united
to
a
woman
who
seemed
a
complete
contrast
to
Mary
Cave
in
all
respects,
he
could
not
forget
the
great
disappointment
of
his
life;
and
when
he
heard
that
what
would
have
been
so
precious
to
him
had
been
neglected,
perhaps
abused,
by
another,
he
conceived
for
that
other
a
rooted
and
bitter
animosity.
Of
the
nature
and
strength
of
this
animosity
Mr.
Helstone
was
but
half
aware.
He
neither
knew
how
much
Yorke
had
loved
Mary
Cave,
what
he
had
felt
on
losing
her,
nor
was
he
conscious
of
the
calumnies
concerning
his
treatment
of
her,
familiar
to
every
ear
in
the
neighbourhood
but
his
own.
He
believed
political
and
religious
differences
alone
separated
him
and
Mr.
Yorke.
Had
he
known
how
the
case
really
stood,
he
would
hardly
have
been
induced
by
any
persuasion
to
cross
his
former
rival's
threshold.
Mr.
Yorke
did
not
resume
his
lecture
of
Robert
Moore.
The
conversation
ere
long
recommenced
in
a
more
general
form,
though
still
in
a
somewhat
disputative
tone.
The
unquiet
state
of
the
country,
the
various
depredations
lately
committed
on
mill
property
in
the
district,
supplied
abundant
matter
for
disagreement,
especially
as
each
of
the
three
gentlemen
present
differed
more
or
less
in
his
views
on
these
subjects.
Mr.
Helstone
thought
the
masters
aggrieved,
the
workpeople
unreasonable;
he
condemned
