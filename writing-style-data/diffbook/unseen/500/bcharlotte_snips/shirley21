and
reflecting.
An
impatient
trampling
of
one
of
the
horses
made
him
presently
look
up.
His
eye
in
the
moment
caught
the
gleam
of
something
white
attached
to
a
part
of
the
harness.
Examined
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
this
proved
to
be
a
folded
paper
a
billet.
It
bore
no
address
without;
within
was
the
superscription:
"To
the
Divil
of
Hollow's
Miln."
We
will
not
copy
the
rest
of
the
orthography,
which
was
very
peculiar,
but
translate
it
into
legible
English.
It
ran
thus:
"Your
hellish
machinery
is
shivered
to
smash
on
Stilbro'
Moor,
and
your
men
are
lying
bound
hand
and
foot
in
a
ditch
by
the
roadside.
Take
this
as
a
warning
from
men
that
are
starving,
and
have
starving
wives
and
children
to
go
home
to
when
they
have
done
this
deed.
If
you
get
new
machines,
or
if
you
otherwise
go
on
as
you
have
done,
you
shall
hear
from
us
again.
Beware!"
"Hear
from
you
again?
Yes,
I'll
hear
from
you
again,
and
you
shall
hear
from
me.
I'll
speak
to
you
directly.
On
Stilbro'
Moor
you
shall
hear
from
me
in
a
moment."
Having
led
the
wagons
within
the
gates,
he
hastened
towards
the
cottage.
Opening
the
door,
he
spoke
a
few
words
quickly
but
quietly
to
two
females
who
ran
to
meet
him
in
the
passage.
He
calmed
the
seeming
alarm
of
one
by
a
brief
palliative
account
of
what
had
taken
place;
to
the
other
he
said,
"Go
into
the
mill,
Sarah
there
is
the
key
and
ring
the
mill
bell
as
loud
as
you
can.
Afterwards
you
will
get
another
lantern
and
help
me
to
light
up
the
front."
Returning
to
his
horses,
he
unharnessed,
fed,
and
stabled
them
with
equal
speed
and
care,
pausing
occasionally,
while
so
occupied,
as
if
to
listen
for
the
mill
bell.
It
clanged
out
presently,
with
irregular
but
loud
and
alarming
din.
The
hurried,
agitated
peal
seemed
more
urgent
than
if
the
summons
had
been
steadily
given
by
a
practised
hand.
On
that
still
night,
at
that
unusual
hour,
it
was
heard
a
long
way
round.
The
guests
in
the
kitchen
of
the
Redhouse
were
startled
by
the
clamour,
and
declaring
that
"there
must
be
summat
more
nor
common
to
do
at
Hollow's
Miln,"
they
called
for
lanterns,
and
hurried
to
the
spot
in
a
body.
And
scarcely
had
they
thronged
into
the
yard
with
their
gleaming
lights,
when
the
tramp
of
horses
was
heard,
and
a
little
man
in
a
shovel
hat,
sitting
erect
on
the
back
of
a
shaggy
pony,
"rode
lightly
in,"
followed
by
an
aide
de
camp
mounted
on
a
larger
steed.
Mr.
Moore,
meantime,
after
stabling
his
dray
horses,
had
saddled
his
hackney,
and
with
the
aid
of
Sarah,
the
servant,
lit
up
his
mill,
whose
wide
and
long
front
now
glared
one
great
illumination,
throwing
a
sufficient
light
on
the
yard
to
obviate
all
fear
of
confusion
arising
from
obscurity.
Already
a
deep
hum
of
voices
became
