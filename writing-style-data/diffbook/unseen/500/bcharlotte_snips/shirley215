Armitage
and
Ramsden,
gathered
in
such
a
close
circle
round
them?
And
why
is
Malone
beckoned
to
join
them?
Where
he
is
summoned,
be
sure
a
strong
arm
is
needed."
Shirley,
as
she
watched,
grew
restless;
her
eyes
flashed.
"They
won't
trust
me,"
she
said.
"That
is
always
the
way
when
it
comes
to
the
point."
"What
about?"
"Cannot
you
feel?
There
is
some
mystery
afloat;
some
event
is
expected;
some
preparation
is
to
be
made,
I
am
certain.
I
saw
it
all
in
Mr.
Moore's
manner
this
evening.
He
was
excited,
yet
hard."
"Hard
to
you,
Shirley?"
"Yes,
to
me.
He
often
is
hard
to
me.
We
seldom
converse
tete
a
tete
but
I
am
made
to
feel
that
the
basis
of
his
character
is
not
of
eider
down."
"Yet
he
seemed
to
talk
to
you
softly."
"Did
he
not?
Very
gentle
tones
and
quiet
manner.
Yet
the
man
is
peremptory
and
secret:
his
secrecy
vexes
me."
"Yes,
Robert
is
secret."
"Which
he
has
scarcely
a
right
to
be
with
me,
especially
as
he
commenced
by
giving
me
his
confidence.
Having
done
nothing
to
forfeit
that
confidence,
it
ought
not
to
be
withdrawn;
but
I
suppose
I
am
not
considered
iron
souled
enough
to
be
trusted
in
a
crisis."
"He
fears,
probably,
to
occasion
you
uneasiness."
"An
unnecessary
precaution.
I
am
of
elastic
materials,
not
soon
crushed.
He
ought
to
know
that.
But
the
man
is
proud.
He
has
his
faults,
say
what
you
will,
Lina.
Observe
how
engaged
that
group
appear.
They
do
not
know
we
are
watching
them."
"If
we
keep
on
the
alert,
Shirley,
we
shall
perhaps
find
the
clue
to
their
secret."
"There
will
be
some
unusual
movements
ere
long
perhaps
to
morrow,
possibly
to
night.
But
my
eyes
and
ears
are
wide
open.
Mr.
Moore,
you
shall
be
under
surveillance.
Be
you
vigilant
also,
Lina."
"I
will.
Robert
is
going;
I
saw
him
turn.
I
believe
he
noticed
us.
They
are
shaking
hands."
"Shaking
hands,
with
emphasis,"
added
Shirley,
"as
if
they
were
ratifying
some
solemn
league
and
covenant."
They
saw
Robert
quit
the
group,
pass
through
a
gate,
and
disappear.
"And
he
has
not
bid
us
good
bye,"
murmured
Caroline.
Scarcely
had
the
words
escaped
her
lips
when
she
tried
by
a
smile
to
deny
the
confession
of
disappointment
they
seemed
to
imply.
An
unbidden
suffusion
for
one
moment
both
softened
and
brightened
her
eyes.
"Oh,
that
is
soon
remedied!"
exclaimed
Shirley:
"we'll
make
him
bid
us
good
bye."
"Make
him!
That
is
not
the
same
thing,"
was
the
answer.
"It
shall
be
the
same
thing."
"But
he
is
gone;
you
can't
overtake
him."
"I
know
a
shorter
way
than
that
he
has
taken.
We
will
intercept
him."
"But,
Shirley,
I
would
rather
not
go."
Caroline
said
this
as
Miss
Keeldar
seized
her
arm
and
hurried
her
down
the
fields.
It
was
vain
to
contend.
Nothing
was
so
wilful
as
Shirley
when
she
took
a
whim
into
her
head.
Caroline
found
herself
out
