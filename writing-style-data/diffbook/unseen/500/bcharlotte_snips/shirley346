"Do
we
despise
children?"
"In
fact,
I
am
neither
so
strong,
nor
have
I
such
pride
in
my
strength,
as
people
think,
Mr.
Moore;
nor
am
I
so
regardless
of
sympathy.
But
when
I
have
any
grief,
I
fear
to
impart
it
to
those
I
love,
lest
it
should
pain
them;
and
to
those
whom
I
view
with
indifference
I
cannot
condescend
to
complain.
After
all,
you
should
not
taunt
me
with
being
childish,
for
if
you
were
as
unhappy
as
I
have
been
for
the
last
three
weeks,
you
too
would
want
some
friend."
"We
all
want
a
friend,
do
we
not?"
"All
of
us
that
have
anything
good
in
our
natures."
"Well,
you
have
Caroline
Helstone."
"Yes.
And
you
have
Mr.
Hall."
"Yes.
Mrs.
Pryor
is
a
wise,
good
woman.
She
can
counsel
you
when
you
need
counsel."
"For
your
part,
you
have
your
brother
Robert."
"For
any
right
hand
defections,
there
is
the
Rev.
Matthewson
Helstone,
M.A.,
to
lean
upon;
for
any
left
hand
fallings
off
there
is
Hiram
Yorke,
Esq.
Both
elders
pay
you
homage."
"I
never
saw
Mrs.
Yorke
so
motherly
to
any
young
man
as
she
is
to
you.
I
don't
know
how
you
have
won
her
heart,
but
she
is
more
tender
to
you
than
she
is
to
her
own
sons.
You
have,
besides,
your
sister
Hortense."
"It
appears
we
are
both
well
provided."
"It
appears
so."
"How
thankful
we
ought
to
be!"
"Yes."
"How
contented!"
"Yes."
"For
my
part,
I
am
almost
contented
just
now,
and
very
thankful.
Gratitude
is
a
divine
emotion.
It
fills
the
heart,
but
not
to
bursting;
it
warms
it,
but
not
to
fever.
I
like
to
taste
leisurely
of
bliss.
Devoured
in
haste,
I
do
not
know
its
flavour."
Still
leaning
on
the
back
of
Miss
Keeldar's
chair,
Moore
watched
the
rapid
motion
of
her
fingers,
as
the
green
and
purple
garland
grew
beneath
them.
After
a
prolonged
pause,
he
again
asked,
"Is
the
shadow
quite
gone?"
"Wholly.
As
I
was
two
hours
since,
and
as
I
am
now,
are
two
different
states
of
existence.
I
believe,
Mr.
Moore,
griefs
and
fears
nursed
in
silence
grow
like
Titan
infants."
"You
will
cherish
such
feelings
no
more
in
silence?"
"Not
if
I
dare
speak."
"In
using
the
word
'dare,'
to
whom
do
you
allude?"
"To
you."
"How
is
it
applicable
to
me?"
"On
account
of
your
austerity
and
shyness."
"Why
am
I
austere
and
shy?"
"Because
you
are
proud."
"Why
am
I
proud?"
"I
should
like
to
know.
Will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me?"
"Perhaps,
because
I
am
poor,
for
one
reason.
Poverty
and
pride
often
go
together."
"That
is
such
a
nice
reason.
I
should
be
charmed
to
discover
another
that
would
pair
with
it.
Mate
that
turtle,
Mr.
Moore."
"Immediately.
What
do
you
think
of
marrying
to
sober
Poverty
many
tinted
Caprice?"
"Are
you
capricious?"
"You
are."
"A
libel.
I
am
steady
as
a
rock,
fixed
as
the
polar
star."
"I
look
out
at
