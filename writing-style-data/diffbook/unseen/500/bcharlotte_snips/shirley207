defiled.
It
was
very
narrow
so
narrow
that
only
two
could
walk
abreast
without
falling
into
the
ditch
which
ran
along
each
side.
They
had
gained
the
middle
of
it,
when
excitement
became
obvious
in
the
clerical
commanders.
Boultby's
spectacles
and
Helstone's
Rehoboam
were
agitated;
the
curates
nudged
each
other;
Mr.
Hall
turned
to
the
ladies
and
smiled.
"What
is
the
matter?"
was
the
demand.
He
pointed
with
his
staff
to
the
end
of
the
lane
before
them.
Lo
and
behold!
another,
an
opposition,
procession
was
there
entering,
headed
also
by
men
in
black,
and
followed
also,
as
they
could
now
hear,
by
music.
"Is
it
our
double?"
asked
Shirley,
"our
manifold
wraith?
Here
is
a
card
turned
up."
"If
you
wanted
a
battle,
you
are
likely
to
get
one
at
least
of
looks,"
whispered
Caroline,
laughing.
"They
shall
not
pass
us!"
cried
the
curates
unanimously;
"we'll
not
give
way!"
"Give
way!"
retorted
Helstone
sternly,
turning
round;
"who
talks
of
giving
way?
You,
boys,
mind
what
you
are
about.
The
ladies,
I
know,
will
be
firm.
I
can
trust
them.
There
is
not
a
churchwoman
here
but
will
stand
her
ground
against
these
folks,
for
the
honour
of
the
Establishment.
What
does
Miss
Keeldar
say?"
"She
asks
what
is
it."
"The
Dissenting
and
Methodist
schools,
the
Baptists,
Independents,
and
Wesleyans,
joined
in
unholy
alliance,
and
turning
purposely
into
this
lane
with
the
intention
of
obstructing
our
march
and
driving
us
back."
"Bad
manners!"
said
Shirley,
"and
I
hate
bad
manners.
Of
course,
they
must
have
a
lesson."
"A
lesson
in
politeness,"
suggested
Mr.
Hall,
who
was
ever
for
peace;
"not
an
example
of
rudeness."
Old
Helstone
moved
on.
Quickening
his
step,
he
marched
some
yards
in
advance
of
his
company.
He
had
nearly
reached
the
other
sable
leaders,
when
he
who
appeared
to
act
as
the
hostile
commander
in
chief
a
large,
greasy
man,
with
black
hair
combed
flat
on
his
forehead
called
a
halt.
The
procession
paused.
He
drew
forth
a
hymn
book,
gave
out
a
verse,
set
a
tune,
and
they
all
struck
up
the
most
dolorous
of
canticles.
Helstone
signed
to
his
bands.
They
clashed
out
with
all
the
power
of
brass.
He
desired
them
to
play
"Rule,
Britannia!"
and
ordered
the
children
to
join
in
vocally,
which
they
did
with
enthusiastic
spirit.
The
enemy
was
sung
and
stormed
down,
his
psalm
quelled.
As
far
as
noise
went,
he
was
conquered.
"Now,
follow
me!"
exclaimed
Helstone;
"not
at
a
run,
but
at
a
firm,
smart
pace.
Be
steady,
every
child
and
woman
of
you.
Keep
together.
Hold
on
by
each
other's
skirts,
if
necessary."
And
he
strode
on
with
such
a
determined
and
deliberate
gait,
and
was,
besides,
so
well
seconded
by
his
scholars
and
teachers,
who
did
exactly
as
he
told
them,
neither
running
nor
faltering,
but
marching
with
cool,
solid
impetus
the
curates,
too,
being
compelled
to
do
the
same,
as
they
were
between
two
fires,
Helstone
and
Miss
Keeldar,
both
of
whom
watched
any
