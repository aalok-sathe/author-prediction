sailed
her
three
daughters,
a
showy
trio,
being
all
three
well
grown,
and
more
or
less
handsome.
In
English
country
ladies
there
is
this
point
to
be
remarked.
Whether
young
or
old,
pretty
or
plain,
dull
or
sprightly,
they
all
(or
almost
all)
have
a
certain
expression
stamped
on
their
features,
which
seems
to
say,
"I
know
I
do
not
boast
of
it,
but
I
know
that
I
am
the
standard
of
what
is
proper;
let
every
one
therefore
whom
I
approach,
or
who
approaches
me,
keep
a
sharp
lookout,
for
wherein
they
differ
from
me
be
the
same
in
dress,
manner,
opinion,
principle,
or
practice
therein
they
are
wrong."
Mrs.
and
Misses
Sykes,
far
from
being
exceptions
to
this
observation,
were
pointed
illustrations
of
its
truth.
Miss
Mary
a
well
looked,
well
meant,
and,
on
the
whole,
well
dispositioned
girl
wore
her
complacency
with
some
state,
though
without
harshness.
Miss
Harriet
a
beauty
carried
it
more
overbearingly;
she
looked
high
and
cold.
Miss
Hannah,
who
was
conceited,
dashing,
pushing,
flourished
hers
consciously
and
openly.
The
mother
evinced
it
with
the
gravity
proper
to
her
age
and
religious
fame.
The
reception
was
got
through
somehow.
Caroline
"was
glad
to
see
them"
(an
unmitigated
fib),
hoped
they
were
well,
hoped
Mrs.
Sykes's
cough
was
better
(Mrs.
Sykes
had
had
a
cough
for
the
last
twenty
years),
hoped
the
Misses
Sykes
had
left
their
sisters
at
home
well;
to
which
inquiry
the
Misses
Sykes,
sitting
on
three
chairs
opposite
the
music
stool,
whereon
Caroline
had
undesignedly
come
to
anchor,
after
wavering
for
some
seconds
between
it
and
a
large
arm
chair,
into
which
she
at
length
recollected
she
ought
to
induct
Mrs.
Sykes
and
indeed
that
lady
saved
her
the
trouble
by
depositing
herself
therein
the
Misses
Sykes
replied
to
Caroline
by
one
simultaneous
bow,
very
majestic
and
mighty
awful.
A
pause
followed.
This
bow
was
of
a
character
to
ensure
silence
for
the
next
five
minutes,
and
it
did.
Mrs.
Sykes
then
inquired
after
Mr.
Helstone,
and
whether
he
had
had
any
return
of
rheumatism,
and
whether
preaching
twice
on
a
Sunday
fatigued
him,
and
if
he
was
capable
of
taking
a
full
service
now;
and
on
being
assured
he
was,
she
and
all
her
daughters,
combining
in
chorus,
expressed
their
opinion
that
he
was
"a
wonderful
man
of
his
years."
Pause
second.
Miss
Mary,
getting
up
the
steam
in
her
turn,
asked
whether
Caroline
had
attended
the
Bible
Society
meeting
which
had
been
held
at
Nunnely
last
Thursday
night.
The
negative
answer
which
truth
compelled
Caroline
to
utter
for
last
Thursday
evening
she
had
been
sitting
at
home,
reading
a
novel
which
Robert
had
lent
her
elicited
a
simultaneous
expression
of
surprise
from
the
lips
of
the
four
ladies.
"We
were
all
there,"
said
Miss
Mary
"mamma
and
all
of
us.
We
even
persuaded
papa
to
go.
Hannah
would
insist
upon
it.
But
he
fell
asleep
while
Mr.
Langweilig,
the
German
Moravian
minister,
was
speaking.
I
felt
quite
ashamed,
