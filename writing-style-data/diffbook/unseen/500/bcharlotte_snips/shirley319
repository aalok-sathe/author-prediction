often
takes
the
form
of
repeating
again
and
again
a
similar
stroke
of
luck
in
the
same
quarter.
It
appeared
that
Miss
Keeldar
or
her
fortune
had
by
this
time
made
a
sensation
in
the
district,
and
produced
an
impression
in
quarters
by
her
unthought
of.
No
less
than
three
offers
followed
Mr.
Wynne's,
all
more
or
less
eligible.
All
were
in
succession
pressed
on
her
by
her
uncle,
and
all
in
succession
she
refused.
Yet
amongst
them
was
more
than
one
gentleman
of
unexceptionable
character
as
well
as
ample
wealth.
Many
besides
her
uncle
asked
what
she
meant,
and
whom
she
expected
to
entrap,
that
she
was
so
insolently
fastidious.
At
last
the
gossips
thought
they
had
found
the
key
to
her
conduct,
and
her
uncle
was
sure
of
it;
and
what
is
more,
the
discovery
showed
his
niece
to
him
in
quite
a
new
light,
and
he
changed
his
whole
deportment
to
her
accordingly.
Fieldhead
had
of
late
been
fast
growing
too
hot
to
hold
them
both.
The
suave
aunt
could
not
reconcile
them;
the
daughters
froze
at
the
view
of
their
quarrels.
Gertrude
and
Isabella
whispered
by
the
hour
together
in
their
dressing
room,
and
became
chilled
with
decorous
dread
if
they
chanced
to
be
left
alone
with
their
audacious
cousin.
But,
as
I
have
said,
a
change
supervened.
Mr.
Sympson
was
appeased
and
his
family
tranquillized.
The
village
of
Nunnely
has
been
alluded
to
its
old
church,
its
forest,
its
monastic
ruins.
It
had
also
its
hall,
called
the
priory
an
older,
a
larger,
a
more
lordly
abode
than
any
Briarfield
or
Whinbury
owned;
and
what
is
more,
it
had
its
man
of
title
its
baronet,
which
neither
Briarfield
nor
Whinbury
could
boast.
This
possession
its
proudest
and
most
prized
had
for
years
been
nominal
only.
The
present
baronet,
a
young
man
hitherto
resident
in
a
distant
province,
was
unknown
on
his
Yorkshire
estate.
During
Miss
Keeldar's
stay
at
the
fashionable
watering
place
of
Cliffbridge,
she
and
her
friends
had
met
with
and
been
introduced
to
Sir
Philip
Nunnely.
They
encountered
him
again
and
again
on
the
sands,
the
cliffs,
in
the
various
walks,
sometimes
at
the
public
balls
of
the
place.
He
seemed
solitary.
His
manner
was
very
unpretending
too
simple
to
be
termed
affable;
rather
timid
than
proud.
He
did
not
condescend
to
their
society;
he
seemed
glad
of
it.
With
any
unaffected
individual
Shirley
could
easily
and
quickly
cement
an
acquaintance.
She
walked
and
talked
with
Sir
Philip;
she,
her
aunt,
and
cousins
sometimes
took
a
sail
in
his
yacht.
She
liked
him
because
she
found
him
kind
and
modest,
and
was
charmed
to
feel
she
had
the
power
to
amuse
him.
One
slight
drawback
there
was
where
is
the
friendship
without
it?
Sir
Philip
had
a
literary
turn.
He
wrote
poetry
sonnets,
stanzas,
ballads.
Perhaps
Miss
Keeldar
thought
him
a
little
too
fond
of
reading
and
reciting
these
compositions;
perhaps
she
wished
the
rhyme
had
possessed
more
accuracy,
the
measure
more
music,
