beam
of
reviving
sympathy,
she
would
gladden
an
hour
with
converse
so
gentle,
gay,
and
kindly
that
I
could
no
more
shut
my
heart
on
her
image
than
I
could
close
that
door
against
her
presence.
Explain
why
she
distressed
me
so."
"She
could
not
bear
to
be
quite
outcast;
and
then
she
would
sometimes
get
a
notion
into
her
head,
on
a
cold,
wet
day,
that
the
schoolroom
was
no
cheerful
place,
and
feel
it
incumbent
on
her
to
go
and
see
if
you
and
Henry
kept
up
a
good
fire;
and
once
there,
she
liked
to
stay."
"But
she
should
not
be
changeful.
If
she
came
at
all,
she
should
come
oftener."
"There
is
such
a
thing
as
intrusion."
"To
morrow
you
will
not
be
as
you
are
to
day."
"I
don't
know.
Will
you?"
"I
am
not
mad,
most
noble
Berenice!
We
may
give
one
day
to
dreaming,
but
the
next
we
must
awake;
and
I
shall
awake
to
purpose
the
morning
you
are
married
to
Sir
Philip
Nunnely.
The
fire
shines
on
you
and
me,
and
shows
us
very
clearly
in
the
glass,
Miss
Keeldar;
and
I
have
been
gazing
on
the
picture
all
the
time
I
have
been
talking.
Look
up!
What
a
difference
between
your
head
and
mine!
I
look
old
for
thirty!"
"You
are
so
grave;
you
have
such
a
square
brow;
and
your
face
is
sallow.
I
never
regard
you
as
a
young
man,
nor
as
Robert's
junior."
"Don't
you?
I
thought
not.
Imagine
Robert's
clear
cut,
handsome
face
looking
over
my
shoulder.
Does
not
the
apparition
make
vividly
manifest
the
obtuse
mould
of
my
heavy
traits?
There!"
(he
started),
"I
have
been
expecting
that
wire
to
vibrate
this
last
half
hour."
The
dinner
bell
rang,
and
Shirley
rose.
"Mr.
Moore,"
she
said,
as
she
gathered
up
her
silks,
"have
you
heard
from
your
brother
lately?
Do
you
know
what
he
means
by
staying
in
town
so
long?
Does
he
talk
of
returning?"
"He
talks
of
returning;
but
what
has
caused
his
long
absence
I
cannot
tell.
To
speak
the
truth,
I
thought
none
in
Yorkshire
knew
better
than
yourself
why
he
was
reluctant
to
come
home."
A
crimson
shadow
passed
across
Miss
Keeldar's
cheek.
"Write
to
him
and
urge
him
to
come,"
she
said.
"I
know
there
has
been
no
impolicy
in
protracting
his
absence
thus
far.
It
is
good
to
let
the
mill
stand,
while
trade
is
so
bad;
but
he
must
not
abandon
the
county."
"I
am
aware,"
said
Louis,
"that
he
had
an
interview
with
you
the
evening
before
he
left,
and
I
saw
him
quit
Fieldhead
afterwards.
I
read
his
countenance,
or
tried
to
read
it.
He
turned
from
me.
I
divined
that
he
would
be
long
away.
Some
fine,
slight
fingers
have
a
wondrous
knack
at
pulverizing
a
man's
brittle
pride.
I
suppose
Robert
put
too
much
trust
in
his
manly
beauty
and
native
gentlemanhood.
Those
are
better
off
who,
being
destitute
of
advantage,
cannot
cherish
