Highlands.
We
will,
if
you
can
bear
a
sea
voyage,
go
to
the
Isles
the
Hebrides,
the
Shetland,
the
Orkney
Islands.
Would
you
not
like
that?
I
see
you
would.
Mrs.
Pryor,
I
call
you
to
witness.
Her
face
is
all
sunshine
at
the
bare
mention
of
it."
"I
should
like
it
much,"
returned
Caroline,
to
whom,
indeed,
the
notion
of
such
a
tour
was
not
only
pleasant,
but
gloriously
reviving.
Shirley
rubbed
her
hands.
"Come;
I
can
bestow
a
benefit,"
she
exclaimed.
"I
can
do
a
good
deed
with
my
cash.
My
thousand
a
year
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
dirty
bank
notes
and
jaundiced
guineas
(let
me
speak
respectfully
of
both,
though,
for
I
adore
them),
but,
it
may
be,
health
to
the
drooping,
strength
to
the
weak,
consolation
to
the
sad.
I
was
determined
to
make
something
of
it
better
than
a
fine
old
house
to
live
in,
than
satin
gowns
to
wear,
better
than
deference
from
acquaintance
and
homage
from
the
poor.
Here
is
to
begin.
This
summer,
Caroline,
Mrs.
Pryor
and
I
go
out
into
the
North
Atlantic,
beyond
the
Shetland,
perhaps
to
the
Faroe
Isles.
We
will
see
seals
in
Suderoe,
and,
doubtless,
mermaids
in
Stromoe.
Caroline
is
laughing,
Mrs.
Pryor.
I
made
her
laugh;
I
have
done
her
good."
"I
shall
like
to
go,
Shirley,"
again
said
Miss
Helstone.
"I
long
to
hear
the
sound
of
waves
ocean
waves
and
to
see
them
as
I
have
imagined
them
in
dreams,
like
tossing
banks
of
green
light,
strewed
with
vanishing
and
reappearing
wreaths
of
foam,
whiter
than
lilies.
I
shall
delight
to
pass
the
shores
of
those
lone
rock
islets
where
the
sea
birds
live
and
breed
unmolested.
We
shall
be
on
the
track
of
the
old
Scandinavians
of
the
Norsemen.
We
shall
almost
see
the
shores
of
Norway.
This
is
a
very
vague
delight
that
I
feel,
communicated
by
your
proposal,
but
it
is
a
delight."
"Will
you
think
of
Fitful
Head
now
when
you
lie
awake
at
night,
of
gulls
shrieking
round
it,
and
waves
tumbling
in
upon
it,
rather
than
of
the
graves
under
the
rectory
back
kitchen?"
"I
will
try;
and
instead
of
musing
about
remnants
of
shrouds,
and
fragments
of
coffins,
and
human
bones
and
mould,
I
will
fancy
seals
lying
in
the
sunshine
on
solitary
shores,
where
neither
fisherman
nor
hunter
ever
come;
of
rock
crevices
full
of
pearly
eggs
bedded
in
seaweed;
of
unscared
birds
covering
white
sands
in
happy
flocks."
"And
what
will
become
of
that
inexpressible
weight
you
said
you
had
on
your
mind?"
"I
will
try
to
forget
it
in
speculation
on
the
sway
of
the
whole
great
deep
above
a
herd
of
whales
rushing
through
the
livid
and
liquid
thunder
down
from
the
frozen
zone
a
hundred
of
them,
perhaps,
wallowing,
flashing,
rolling
in
the
wake
of
a
patriarch
bull,
huge
enough
to
have
been
spawned
before
the
Flood,
such
a
creature
as
poor
Smart
had
in
his
mind
when
he
said,
