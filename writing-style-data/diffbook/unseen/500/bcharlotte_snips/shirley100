Chapel
seemed
alive,
so
also
did
Briarmains,
though
certainly
the
mansion
appeared
to
enjoy
a
quieter
phase
of
existence
than
the
temple.
Some
of
its
windows
too
were
aglow;
the
lower
casements
opened
upon
the
lawn;
curtains
concealed
the
interior,
and
partly
obscured
the
ray
of
the
candles
which
lit
it,
but
they
did
not
entirely
muffle
the
sound
of
voice
and
laughter.
We
are
privileged
to
enter
that
front
door,
and
to
penetrate
to
the
domestic
sanctum.
It
is
not
the
presence
of
company
which
makes
Mr.
Yorke's
habitation
lively,
for
there
is
none
within
it
save
his
own
family,
and
they
are
assembled
in
that
farthest
room
to
the
right,
the
back
parlour.
This
is
the
usual
sitting
room
of
an
evening.
Those
windows
would
be
seen
by
daylight
to
be
of
brilliantly
stained
glass,
purple
and
amber
the
predominant
hues,
glittering
round
a
gravely
tinted
medallion
in
the
centre
of
each,
representing
the
suave
head
of
William
Shakespeare,
and
the
serene
one
of
John
Milton.
Some
Canadian
views
hung
on
the
walls
green
forest
and
blue
water
scenery
and
in
the
midst
of
them
blazes
a
night
eruption
of
Vesuvius;
very
ardently
it
glows,
contrasted
with
the
cool
foam
and
azure
of
cataracts,
and
the
dusky
depths
of
woods.
The
fire
illuminating
this
room,
reader,
is
such
as,
if
you
be
a
southern,
you
do
not
often
see
burning
on
the
hearth
of
a
private
apartment.
It
is
a
clear,
hot
coal
fire,
heaped
high
in
the
ample
chimney.
Mr.
Yorke
will
have
such
fires
even
in
warm
summer
weather.
He
sits
beside
it
with
a
book
in
his
hand,
a
little
round
stand
at
his
elbow
supporting
a
candle;
but
he
is
not
reading
he
is
watching
his
children.
Opposite
to
him
sits
his
lady
a
personage
whom
I
might
describe
minutely,
but
I
feel
no
vocation
to
the
task.
I
see
her,
though,
very
plainly
before
me
a
large
woman
of
the
gravest
aspect,
care
on
her
front
and
on
her
shoulders,
but
not
overwhelming,
inevitable
care,
rather
the
sort
of
voluntary,
exemplary
cloud
and
burden
people
ever
carry
who
deem
it
their
duty
to
be
gloomy.
Ah,
well
a
day!
Mrs.
Yorke
had
that
notion,
and
grave
as
Saturn
she
was,
morning,
noon,
and,
night;
and
hard
things
she
thought
if
any
unhappy
wight
especially
of
the
female
sex
who
dared
in
her
presence
to
show
the
light
of
a
gay
heart
on
a
sunny
countenance.
In
her
estimation,
to
be
mirthful
was
to
be
profane,
to
be
cheerful
was
to
be
frivolous.
She
drew
no
distinctions.
Yet
she
was
a
very
good
wife,
a
very
careful
mother,
looked
after
her
children
unceasingly,
was
sincerely
attached
to
her
husband;
only
the
worst
of
it
was,
if
she
could
have
had
her
will,
she
would
not
have
permitted
him
to
have
any
friend
in
the
world
beside
herself.
All
his
relations
were
insupportable
to
her,
and
she
kept
them
at
arm's
length.
Mr.
Yorke
and
