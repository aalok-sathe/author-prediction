me,
and
that
whatever
effort
I
might
make
to
please
would
hereafter
be
worse
than
useless,
since
it
was
inevitably
in
its
nature
to
change
and
become
indifferent.
That
discovery
once
made,
what
should
I
long
for?
To
go
away,
to
remove
from
a
presence
where
my
society
gave
no
pleasure."
"But
you
could
not
if
you
were
married."
"No,
I
could
not.
There
it
is.
I
could
never
be
my
own
mistress
more.
A
terrible
thought!
It
suffocates
me!
Nothing
irks
me
like
the
idea
of
being
a
burden
and
a
bore
an
inevitable
burden,
a
ceaseless
bore!
Now,
when
I
feel
my
company
superfluous,
I
can
comfortably
fold
my
independence
round
me
like
a
mantle,
and
drop
my
pride
like
a
veil,
and
withdraw
to
solitude.
If
married,
that
could
not
be."
"I
wonder
we
don't
all
make
up
our
minds
to
remain
single,"
said
Caroline.
"We
should
if
we
listened
to
the
wisdom
of
experience.
My
uncle
always
speaks
of
marriage
as
a
burden;
and
I
believe
whenever
he
hears
of
a
man
being
married
he
invariably
regards
him
as
a
fool,
or,
at
any
rate,
as
doing
a
foolish
thing."
"But,
Caroline,
men
are
not
all
like
your
uncle.
Surely
not.
I
hope
not."
She
paused
and
mused.
"I
suppose
we
each
find
an
exception
in
the
one
we
love,
till
we
are
married,"
suggested
Caroline.
"I
suppose
so.
And
this
exception
we
believe
to
be
of
sterling
materials.
We
fancy
it
like
ourselves;
we
imagine
a
sense
of
harmony.
We
think
his
voice
gives
the
softest,
truest
promise
of
a
heart
that
will
never
harden
against
us;
we
read
in
his
eyes
that
faithful
feeling
affection.
I
don't
think
we
should
trust
to
what
they
call
passion
at
all,
Caroline.
I
believe
it
is
a
mere
fire
of
dry
sticks,
blazing
up
and
vanishing.
But
we
watch
him,
and
see
him
kind
to
animals,
to
little
children,
to
poor
people.
He
is
kind
to
us
likewise,
good,
considerate.
He
does
not
flatter
women,
but
he
is
patient
with
them,
and
he
seems
to
be
easy
in
their
presence,
and
to
find
their
company
genial.
He
likes
them
not
only
for
vain
and
selfish
reasons,
but
as
we
like
him
because
we
like
him.
Then
we
observe
that
he
is
just,
that
he
always
speaks
the
truth,
that
he
is
conscientious.
We
feel
joy
and
peace
when
he
comes
into
a
room;
we
feel
sadness
and
trouble
when
he
leaves
it.
We
know
that
this
man
has
been
a
kind
son,
that
he
is
a
kind
brother.
Will
any
one
dare
to
tell
me
that
he
will
not
be
a
kind
husband?"
"My
uncle
would
affirm
it
unhesitatingly.
'He
will
be
sick
of
you
in
a
month,'
he
would
say."
"Mrs.
Pryor
would
seriously
intimate
the
same."
"Mrs.
Yorke
and
Miss
Mann
would
darkly
suggest
ditto."
"If
they
are
true
oracles,
it
is
good
never
to
fall
in
love."
"Very
good,
if
you
can
avoid
it."
