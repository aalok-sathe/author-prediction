course
of
his
alterations
and
improvements,
had
frequent
occasion
to
consult
him.
As
to
the
other
guest
now
present
in
Mr.
Yorke's
parlour,
Mr.
Helstone,
between
him
and
his
host
there
existed
a
double
antipathy
the
antipathy
of
nature
and
that
of
circumstances.
The
free
thinker
hated
the
formalist;
the
lover
of
liberty
detested
the
disciplinarian.
Besides,
it
was
said
that
in
former
years
they
had
been
rival
suitors
of
the
same
lady.
Mr.
Yorke,
as
a
general
rule,
was,
when
young,
noted
for
his
preference
of
sprightly
and
dashing
women:
a
showy
shape
and
air,
a
lively
wit,
a
ready
tongue,
chiefly
seemed
to
attract
him.
He
never,
however,
proposed
to
any
of
these
brilliant
belles
whose
society
he
sought;
and
all
at
once
he
seriously
fell
in
love
with
and
eagerly
wooed
a
girl
who
presented
a
complete
contrast
to
those
he
had
hitherto
noticed
a
girl
with
the
face
of
a
Madonna;
a
girl
of
living
marble
stillness
personified.
No
matter
that,
when
he
spoke
to
her,
she
only
answered
him
in
monosyllables;
no
matter
that
his
sighs
seemed
unheard,
that
his
glances
were
unreturned,
that
she
never
responded
to
his
opinions,
rarely
smiled
at
his
jests,
paid
him
no
respect
and
no
attention;
no
matter
that
she
seemed
the
opposite
of
everything
feminine
he
had
ever
in
his
whole
life
been
known
to
admire.
For
him
Mary
Cave
was
perfect,
because
somehow,
for
some
reason
no
doubt
he
had
a
reason
he
loved
her.
Mr.
Helstone,
at
that
time
curate
of
Briarfield,
loved
Mary
too
or,
at
any
rate,
he
fancied
her.
Several
others
admired
her,
for
she
was
beautiful
as
a
monumental
angel;
but
the
clergyman
was
preferred
for
his
office's
sake
that
office
probably
investing
him
with
some
of
the
illusion
necessary
to
allure
to
the
commission
of
matrimony,
and
which
Miss
Cave
did
not
find
in
any
of
the
young
wool
staplers,
her
other
adorers.
Mr.
Helstone
neither
had,
nor
professed
to
have,
Mr.
Yorke's
absorbing
passion
for
her.
He
had
none
of
the
humble
reverence
which
seemed
to
subdue
most
of
her
suitors;
he
saw
her
more
as
she
really
was
than
the
rest
did.
He
was,
consequently,
more
master
of
her
and
himself.
She
accepted
him
at
the
first
offer,
and
they
were
married.
Nature
never
intended
Mr.
Helstone
to
make
a
very
good
husband,
especially
to
a
quiet
wife.
He
thought
so
long
as
a
woman
was
silent
nothing
ailed
her,
and
she
wanted
nothing.
If
she
did
not
complain
of
solitude,
solitude,
however
continued,
could
not
be
irksome
to
her.
If
she
did
not
talk
and
put
herself
forward,
express
a
partiality
for
this,
an
aversion
to
that,
she
had
no
partialities
or
aversions,
and
it
was
useless
to
consult
her
tastes.
He
made
no
pretence
of
comprehending
women,
or
comparing
them
with
men.
They
were
a
different,
probably
a
very
inferior,
order
of
existence.
A
wife
could
not
be
her
husband's
companion,
much
less
his
confidante,
much
less
