seemed
fully
to
warrant
an
observation
made
about
this
time
by
Mr.
Yorke
to
the
tutor,
Louis.
"Yond'
brother
Robert
of
yours
seems
to
me
to
be
either
a
fool
or
a
madman.
Two
months
ago
I
could
have
sworn
he
had
the
game
all
in
his
own
hands;
and
there
he
runs
the
country,
and
quarters
himself
up
in
London
for
weeks
together,
and
by
the
time
he
comes
back
he'll
find
himself
checkmated.
Louis,
'there
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men,
which,
taken
at
the
flood,
leads
on
to
fortune,
but,
once
let
slip,
never
returns
again.'
I'd
write
to
Robert,
if
I
were
you,
and
remind
him
of
that."
"Robert
had
views
on
Miss
Keeldar?"
inquired
Louis,
as
if
the
idea
was
new
to
him.
"Views
I
suggested
to
him
myself,
and
views
he
might
have
realized,
for
she
liked
him."
"As
a
neighbour?"
"As
more
than
that.
I
have
seen
her
change
countenance
and
colour
at
the
mere
mention
of
his
name.
Write
to
the
lad,
I
say,
and
tell
him
to
come
home.
He
is
a
finer
gentleman
than
this
bit
of
a
baronet,
after
all."
"Does
it
not
strike
you,
Mr.
Yorke,
that
for
a
mere
penniless
adventurer
to
aspire
to
a
rich
woman's
hand
is
presumptuous
contemptible?"
"Oh,
if
you
are
for
high
notions
and
double
refined
sentiment,
I've
naught
to
say.
I'm
a
plain,
practical
man
myself,
and
if
Robert
is
willing
to
give
up
that
royal
prize
to
a
lad
rival
a
puling
slip
of
aristocracy
I
am
quite
agreeable.
At
his
age,
in
his
place,
with
his
inducements,
I
would
have
acted
differently.
Neither
baronet,
nor
duke,
nor
prince
should
have
snatched
my
sweetheart
from
me
without
a
struggle.
But
you
tutors
are
such
solemn
chaps;
it
is
almost
like
speaking
to
a
parson
to
consult
with
you."
Flattered
and
fawned
upon
as
Shirley
was
just
now,
it
appeared
she
was
not
absolutely
spoiled
that
her
better
nature
did
not
quite
leave
her.
Universal
report
had
indeed
ceased
to
couple
her
name
with
that
of
Moore,
and
this
silence
seemed
sanctioned
by
her
own
apparent
oblivion
of
the
absentee;
but
that
she
had
not
quite
forgotten
him
that
she
still
regarded
him,
if
not
with
love,
yet
with
interest
seemed
proved
by
the
increased
attention
which
at
this
juncture
of
affairs
a
sudden
attack
of
illness
induced
her
to
show
that
tutor
brother
of
Robert's,
to
whom
she
habitually
bore
herself
with
strange
alternations
of
cool
reserve
and
docile
respect
now
sweeping
past
him
in
all
the
dignity
of
the
moneyed
heiress
and
prospective
Lady
Nunnely,
and
anon
accosting
him
as
abashed
school
girls
are
wont
to
accost
their
stern
professors;
bridling
her
neck
of
ivory
and
curling
her
lip
of
carmine,
if
he
encountered
her
glance,
one
minute,
and
the
next
submitting
to
the
grave
rebuke
of
his
eye
with
as
much
contrition
as
if
he
had
the
power
to
inflict
penalties
in
case
of
contumacy.
Louis
