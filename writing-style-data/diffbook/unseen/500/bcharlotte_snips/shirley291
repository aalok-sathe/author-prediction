on
the
white
marble.
There
is
plenty
of
room
for
other
inscriptions
underneath."
"William
Farren
came
to
look
after
your
flowers
this
morning.
He
was
afraid,
now
you
cannot
tend
them
yourself,
they
would
be
neglected.
He
has
taken
two
of
your
favourite
plants
home
to
nurse
for
you."
"If
I
were
to
make
a
will,
I
would
leave
William
all
my
plants;
Shirley
my
trinkets
except
one,
which
must
not
be
taken
off
my
neck;
and
you,
ma'am,
my
books."
After
a
pause
"Mrs.
Pryor,
I
feel
a
longing
wish
for
something."
"For
what,
Caroline?"
"You
know
I
always
delight
to
hear
you
sing.
Sing
me
a
hymn
just
now.
Sing
that
hymn
which
begins,
'Our
God,
our
help
in
ages
past,
Our
hope
for
years
to
come,
Our
shelter
from
the
stormy
blast,
Our
refuge,
haven,
home!'"
Mrs.
Pryor
at
once
complied.
No
wonder
Caroline
liked
to
hear
her
sing.
Her
voice,
even
in
speaking,
was
sweet
and
silver
clear;
in
song
it
was
almost
divine.
Neither
flute
nor
dulcimer
has
tones
so
pure.
But
the
tone
was
secondary,
compared
to
the
expression
which
trembled
through
a
tender
vibration
from
a
feeling
heart.
The
servants
in
the
kitchen,
hearing
the
strain,
stole
to
the
stair
foot
to
listen.
Even
old
Helstone,
as
he
walked
in
the
garden,
pondering
over
the
unaccountable
and
feeble
nature
of
women,
stood
still
amongst
his
borders
to
catch
the
mournful
melody
more
distinctly.
Why
it
reminded
him
of
his
forgotten
dead
wife,
he
could
not
tell;
nor
why
it
made
him
more
concerned
than
he
had
hitherto
been
for
Caroline's
fading
girlhood.
He
was
glad
to
recollect
that
he
had
promised
to
pay
Wynne,
the
magistrate,
a
visit
that
evening.
Low
spirits
and
gloomy
thoughts
were
very
much
his
aversion.
When
they
attacked
him
he
usually
found
means
to
make
them
march
in
double
quick
time.
The
hymn
followed
him
faintly
as
he
crossed
the
fields.
He
hastened
his
customary
sharp
pace,
that
he
might
get
beyond
its
reach.
"Thy
word
commands
our
flesh
to
dust,
'Return,
ye
sons
of
men;'
All
nations
rose
from
earth
at
first,
And
turn
to
earth
again.
"A
thousand
ages
in
Thy
sight
Are
like
an
evening
gone
Short
as
the
watch
that
ends
the
night
Before
the
rising
sun.
"Time,
like
an
ever
rolling
stream,
Bears
all
its
sons
away;
They
fly,
forgotten,
as
a
dream
Dies
at
the
opening
day.
"Like
flowery
fields,
the
nations
stand,
Fresh
in
the
morning
light;
The
flowers
beneath
the
mower's
hand
Lie
withering
ere
'tis
night.
"Our
God,
our
help
in
ages
past,
Our
hope
for
years
to
come,
Be
Thou
our
guard
while
troubles
last
O
Father,
be
our
home!"
"Now
sing
a
song
a
Scottish
song,"
suggested
Caroline,
when
the
hymn
was
over
"'Ye
banks
and
braes
o'
bonnie
Doon.'"
Again
Mrs.
Pryor
obeyed,
or
essayed
to
obey.
At
the
close
of
the
first
stanza
she
stopped.
She
could
get
no
further.
Her
full
heart
flowed
over.
