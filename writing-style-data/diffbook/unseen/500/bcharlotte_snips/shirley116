to
care
for,
his
hopes
he
had
to
pursue;
and
he
would
fulfil
his
destiny.
He
fulfilled
it
so
vigorously
that
ere
long
he
came
to
a
decisive
rupture
with
his
old
Tory
friend
the
rector.
They
quarrelled
at
a
public
meeting,
and
afterwards
exchanged
some
pungent
letters
in
the
newspapers.
Mr.
Helstone
denounced
Moore
as
a
Jacobin,
ceased
to
see
him,
would
not
even
speak
to
him
when
they
met.
He
intimated
also
to
his
niece,
very
distinctly,
that
her
communications
with
Hollow's
Cottage
must
for
the
present
cease;
she
must
give
up
taking
French
lessons.
The
language,
he
observed,
was
a
bad
and
frivolous
one
at
the
best,
and
most
of
the
works
it
boasted
were
bad
and
frivolous,
highly
injurious
in
their
tendency
to
weak
female
minds.
He
wondered
(he
remarked
parenthetically)
what
noodle
first
made
it
the
fashion
to
teach
women
French.
Nothing
was
more
improper
for
them.
It
was
like
feeding
a
rickety
child
on
chalk
and
water
gruel.
Caroline
must
give
it
up,
and
give
up
her
cousins
too.
They
were
dangerous
people.
Mr.
Helstone
quite
expected
opposition
to
this
order;
he
expected
tears.
Seldom
did
he
trouble
himself
about
Caroline's
movements,
but
a
vague
idea
possessed
him
that
she
was
fond
of
going
to
Hollow's
Cottage;
also
he
suspected
that
she
liked
Robert
Moore's
occasional
presence
at
the
rectory.
The
Cossack
had
perceived
that
whereas
if
Malone
stepped
in
of
an
evening
to
make
himself
sociable
and
charming,
by
pinching
the
ears
of
an
aged
black
cat,
which
usually
shared
with
Miss
Helstone's
feet
the
accommodation
of
her
footstool,
or
by
borrowing
a
fowling
piece,
and
banging
away
at
a
tool
shed
door
in
the
garden
while
enough
of
daylight
remained
to
show
that
conspicuous
mark,
keeping
the
passage
and
sitting
room
doors
meantime
uncomfortably
open
for
the
convenience
of
running
in
and
out
to
announce
his
failures
and
successes
with
noisy
brusquerie
he
had
observed
that
under
such
entertaining
circumstances
Caroline
had
a
trick
of
disappearing,
tripping
noiselessly
upstairs,
and
remaining
invisible
till
called
down
to
supper.
On
the
other
hand,
when
Robert
Moore
was
the
guest,
though
he
elicited
no
vivacities
from
the
cat,
did
nothing
to
it,
indeed,
beyond
occasionally
coaxing
it
from
the
stool
to
his
knee,
and
there
letting
it
purr,
climb
to
his
shoulder,
and
rub
its
head
against
his
cheek;
though
there
was
no
ear
splitting
cracking
off
of
firearms,
no
diffusion
of
sulphurous
gunpowder
perfume,
no
noise,
no
boasting
during
his
stay
that
still
Caroline
sat
in
the
room,
and
seemed
to
find
wondrous
content
in
the
stitching
of
Jew
basket
pin
cushions
and
the
knitting
of
missionary
basket
socks.
She
was
very
quiet,
and
Robert
paid
her
little
attention,
scarcely
ever
addressing
his
discourse
to
her;
but
Mr.
Helstone,
not
being
one
of
those
elderly
gentlemen
who
are
easily
blinded
on
the
contrary,
finding
himself
on
all
occasions
extremely
wide
awake
had
watched
them
when
they
bade
each
other
good
night.
He
had
just
