her
husband;
she
has
not
yet
found
out
that
he
is
hampered
by
a
secret
intrigue
which
prevents
him
from
marrying,
or
that
he
is
a
wolf
in
sheep's
clothing
discoveries
which
she
made
at
an
early
date
after
marriage
concerning
most
of
her
husband's
bachelor
friends,
and
excluded
them
from
her
board
accordingly;
which
part
of
her
conduct,
indeed,
might
be
said
to
have
its
just
and
sensible
as
well
as
its
harsh
side.
"Well,
is
it
you?"
she
says
to
Mr.
Moore,
as
he
comes
up
to
her
and
gives
his
hand.
"What
are
you
roving
about
at
this
time
of
night
for?
You
should
be
at
home."
"Can
a
single
man
be
said
to
have
a
home,
madam?"
he
asks.
"Pooh!"
says
Mrs.
Yorke,
who
despises
conventional
smoothness
quite
as
much
as
her
husband
does,
and
practises
it
as
little,
and
whose
plain
speaking
on
all
occasions
is
carried
to
a
point
calculated,
sometimes,
to
awaken
admiration,
but
oftener
alarm
"pooh!
you
need
not
talk
nonsense
to
me;
a
single
man
can
have
a
home
if
he
likes.
Pray,
does
not
your
sister
make
a
home
for
you?"
"Not
she,"
joined
in
Mr.
Yorke.
"Hortense
is
an
honest
lass.
But
when
I
was
Robert's
age
I
had
five
or
six
sisters,
all
as
decent
and
proper
as
she
is;
but
you
see,
Hesther,
for
all
that
it
did
not
hinder
me
from
looking
out
for
a
wife."
"And
sorely
he
has
repented
marrying
me,"
added
Mrs.
Yorke,
who
liked
occasionally
to
crack
a
dry
jest
against
matrimony,
even
though
it
should
be
at
her
own
expense.
"He
has
repented
it
in
sackcloth
and
ashes,
Robert
Moore,
as
you
may
well
believe
when
you
see
his
punishment"
(here
she
pointed
to
her
children).
"Who
would
burden
themselves
with
such
a
set
of
great,
rough
lads
as
those,
if
they
could
help
it?
It
is
not
only
bringing
them
into
the
world,
though
that
is
bad
enough,
but
they
are
all
to
feed,
to
clothe,
to
rear,
to
settle
in
life.
Young
sir,
when
you
feel
tempted
to
marry,
think
of
our
four
sons
and
two
daughters,
and
look
twice
before
you
leap."
"I
am
not
tempted
now,
at
any
rate.
I
think
these
are
not
times
for
marrying
or
giving
in
marriage."
A
lugubrious
sentiment
of
this
sort
was
sure
to
obtain
Mrs.
Yorke's
approbation.
She
nodded
and
groaned
acquiescence;
but
in
a
minute
she
said,
"I
make
little
account
of
the
wisdom
of
a
Solomon
of
your
age;
it
will
be
upset
by
the
first
fancy
that
crosses
you.
Meantime,
sit
down,
sir.
You
can
talk,
I
suppose,
as
well
sitting
as
standing?"
This
was
her
way
of
inviting
her
guest
to
take
a
chair.
He
had
no
sooner
obeyed
her
than
little
Jessy
jumped
from
her
father's
knee
and
ran
into
Mr.
Moore's
arms,
which
were
very
promptly
held
out
to
receive
her.
"You
talk
of
marrying
him,"
said
she
to
her
mother,
quite
indignantly,
as
