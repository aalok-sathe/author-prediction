at
her
hand.
The
old
gentleman,
too,
had
publicly
declared
that
the
Fieldhead
estate
and
the
De
Walden
estate
were
delightfully
contagious
a
malapropism
which
rumour
had
not
failed
to
repeat
to
Shirley.
Caroline's
ears
yet
rung
with
that
thrilling
whisper,
"I
expect
Mr.
Moore,"
her
heart
yet
beat
and
her
cheek
yet
glowed
with
it,
when
a
note
from
the
organ
pealed
above
the
confused
hum
of
the
place.
Dr.
Boultby,
Mr.
Helstone,
and
Mr.
Hall
rose,
so
did
all
present,
and
grace
was
sung
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
music;
and
then
tea
began.
She
was
kept
too
busy
with
her
office
for
a
while
to
have
leisure
for
looking
round,
but
the
last
cup
being
filled,
she
threw
a
restless
glance
over
the
room.
There
were
some
ladies
and
several
gentlemen
standing
about
yet
unaccommodated
with
seats.
Amidst
a
group
she
recognized
her
spinster
friend,
Miss
Mann,
whom
the
fine
weather
had
tempted,
or
some
urgent
friend
had
persuaded,
to
leave
her
drear
solitude
for
one
hour
of
social
enjoyment.
Miss
Mann
looked
tired
of
standing;
a
lady
in
a
yellow
bonnet
brought
her
a
chair.
Caroline
knew
well
that
chapeau
en
satin
jaune;
she
knew
the
black
hair,
and
the
kindly
though
rather
opinionated
and
froward
looking
face
under
it;
she
knew
that
robe
de
soie
noire,
she
knew
even
that
schall
gris
de
lin;
she
knew,
in
short,
Hortense
Moore,
and
she
wanted
to
jump
up
and
run
to
her
and
kiss
her
to
give
her
one
embrace
for
her
own
sake
and
two
for
her
brother's.
She
half
rose,
indeed,
with
a
smothered
exclamation,
and
perhaps
for
the
impulse
was
very
strong
she
would
have
run
across
the
room
and
actually
saluted
her;
but
a
hand
replaced
her
in
her
seat,
and
a
voice
behind
her
whispered,
"Wait
till
after
tea,
Lina,
and
then
I'll
bring
her
to
you."
And
when
she
could
look
up
she
did,
and
there
was
Robert
himself
close
behind,
smiling
at
her
eagerness,
looking
better
than
she
had
ever
seen
him
look
looking,
indeed,
to
her
partial
eyes,
so
very
handsome
that
she
dared
not
trust
herself
to
hazard
a
second
glance;
for
his
image
struck
on
her
vision
with
painful
brightness,
and
pictured
itself
on
her
memory
as
vividly
as
if
there
daguerreotyped
by
a
pencil
of
keen
lightning.
He
moved
on,
and
spoke
to
Miss
Keeldar.
Shirley,
irritated
by
some
unwelcome
attentions
from
Sam
Wynne,
and
by
the
fact
of
that
gentleman
being
still
seated
on
her
gloves
and
handkerchief
and
probably,
also,
by
Moore's
want
of
punctuality
was
by
no
means
in
good
humour.
She
first
shrugged
her
shoulders
at
him,
and
then
she
said
a
bitter
word
or
two
about
his
"insupportable
tardiness."
Moore
neither
apologized
nor
retorted.
He
stood
near
her
quietly,
as
if
waiting
to
see
whether
she
would
recover
her
temper;
which
she
did
in
little
more
than
three
minutes,
indicating
the
change
by
offering
him
her
hand.
Moore
took
it
with
