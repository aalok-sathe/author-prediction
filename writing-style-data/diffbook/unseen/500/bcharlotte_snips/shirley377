at
Shirley.
"I
shall
be
glad
to
hear
news
of
him.
Is
he
coming
home?"
"He
is
come.
He
is
in
Yorkshire.
Mr.
Yorke
went
yesterday
to
Stilbro'
to
meet
him."
"Mr.
Moore,
something
is
wrong
"
"Did
my
voice
tremble?
He
is
now
at
Briarmains,
and
I
am
going
to
see
him."
"What
has
occurred?"
"If
you
turn
so
pale
I
shall
be
sorry
I
have
spoken.
It
might
have
been
worse.
Robert
is
not
dead,
but
much
hurt."
"O
sir,
it
is
you
who
are
pale.
Sit
down
near
me."
"Read
the
note.
Let
me
open
it."
Miss
Keeldar
read
the
note.
It
briefly
signified
that
last
night
Robert
Moore
had
been
shot
at
from
behind
the
wall
of
Milldean
plantation,
at
the
foot
of
the
Brow;
that
he
was
wounded
severely,
but
it
was
hoped
not
fatally.
Of
the
assassin,
or
assassins,
nothing
was
known;
they
had
escaped.
"No
doubt,"
Mr.
Yorke
observed,
"it
was
done
in
revenge.
It
was
a
pity
ill
will
had
ever
been
raised;
but
that
could
not
be
helped
now."
"He
is
my
only
brother,"
said
Louis,
as
Shirley
returned
the
note.
"I
cannot
hear
unmoved
that
ruffians
have
laid
in
wait
for
him,
and
shot
him
down,
like
some
wild
beast
from
behind
a
wall."
"Be
comforted;
be
hopeful.
He
will
get
better
I
know
he
will."
Shirley,
solicitous
to
soothe,
held
her
hand
over
Mr.
Moore's
as
it
lay
on
the
arm
of
the
chair.
She
just
touched
it
lightly,
scarce
palpably.
"Well,
give
me
your
hand,"
he
said.
"It
will
be
for
the
first
time;
it
is
in
a
moment
of
calamity.
Give
it
me."
Awaiting
neither
consent
nor
refusal,
he
took
what
he
asked.
"I
am
going
to
Briarmains
now,"
he
went
on.
"I
want
you
to
step
over
to
the
rectory
and
tell
Caroline
Helstone
what
has
happened.
Will
you
do
this?
She
will
hear
it
best
from
you."
"Immediately,"
said
Shirley,
with
docile
promptitude.
"Ought
I
to
say
that
there
is
no
danger?"
"Say
so."
"You
will
come
back
soon,
and
let
me
know
more?"
"I
will
either
come
or
write."
"Trust
me
for
watching
over
Caroline.
I
will
communicate
with
your
sister
too;
but
doubtless
she
is
already
with
Robert?"
"Doubtless,
or
will
be
soon.
Good
morning
now."
"You
will
bear
up,
come
what
may."
"We
shall
see
that."
Shirley's
fingers
were
obliged
to
withdraw
from
the
tutor's.
Louis
was
obliged
to
relinquish
that
hand
folded,
clasped,
hidden
in
his
own.
"I
thought
I
should
have
had
to
support
her,"
he
said,
as
he
walked
towards
Briarmains,
"and
it
is
she
who
has
made
me
strong.
That
look
of
pity,
that
gentle
touch!
No
down
was
ever
softer,
no
elixir
more
potent!
It
lay
like
a
snowflake;
it
thrilled
like
lightning.
A
thousand
times
I
have
longed
to
possess
that
hand
to
have
it
in
mine.
I
have
possessed
it;
for
five
minutes
I
held
it.
Her
fingers
and
mine
can
never
be
strangers
more.
