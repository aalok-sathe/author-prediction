to
be?"
"The
wedding."
"Whose
wedding?"
"Only
that
of
Robert
Gerard
Moore,
Esq.,
of
Hollow's
Cottage,
with
Miss
Keeldar,
daughter
and
heiress
of
the
late
Charles
Cave
Keeldar
of
Fieldhead
Hall."
Shirley
gazed
at
the
questioner
with
rising
colour.
But
the
light
in
her
eye
was
not
faltering;
it
shone
steadily
yes,
it
burned
deeply.
"That
is
your
revenge,"
she
said
slowly;
then
added,
"Would
it
be
a
bad
match,
unworthy
of
the
late
Charles
Cave
Keeldar's
representative?"
"My
lass,
Moore
is
a
gentleman;
his
blood
is
pure
and
ancient
as
mine
or
thine."
"And
we
two
set
store
by
ancient
blood?
We
have
family
pride,
though
one
of
us
at
least
is
a
republican?"
Yorke
bowed
as
he
stood
before
her.
His
lips
were
mute,
but
his
eye
confessed
the
impeachment.
Yes,
he
had
family
pride;
you
saw
it
in
his
whole
bearing.
"Moore
is
a
gentleman,"
echoed
Shirley,
lifting
her
head
with
glad
grace.
She
checked
herself.
Words
seemed
crowding
to
her
tongue.
She
would
not
give
them
utterance;
but
her
look
spoke
much
at
the
moment.
What,
Yorke
tried
to
read,
but
could
not.
The
language
was
there,
visible,
but
untranslatable
a
poem,
a
fervid
lyric,
in
an
unknown
tongue.
It
was
not
a
plain
story,
however,
no
simple
gush
of
feeling,
no
ordinary
love
confession
that
was
obvious.
It
was
something
other,
deeper,
more
intricate
than
he
guessed
at.
He
felt
his
revenge
had
not
struck
home.
He
felt
that
Shirley
triumphed.
She
held
him
at
fault,
baffled,
puzzled.
She
enjoyed
the
moment,
not
he.
"And
if
Moore
is
a
gentleman,
you
can
be
only
a
lady;
therefore
"
"Therefore
there
would
be
no
inequality
in
our
union."
"None."
"Thank
you
for
your
approbation.
Will
you
give
me
away
when
I
relinquish
the
name
of
Keeldar
for
that
of
Moore?"
Mr.
Yorke,
instead
of
replying,
gazed
at
her
much
puzzled.
He
could
not
divine
what
her
look
signified
whether
she
spoke
in
earnest
or
in
jest.
There
were
purpose
and
feeling,
banter
and
scoff,
playing,
mingled,
on
her
mobile
lineaments.
"I
don't
understand
thee,"
he
said,
turning
away.
She
laughed.
"Take
courage,
sir;
you
are
not
singular
in
your
ignorance.
But
I
suppose
if
Moore
understands
me
that
will
do,
will
it
not?"
"Moore
may
settle
his
own
matters
henceforward
for
me;
I'll
neither
meddle
nor
make
with
them
further."
A
new
thought
crossed
her.
Her
countenance
changed
magically.
With
a
sudden
darkening
of
the
eye
and
austere
fixing
of
the
features
she
demanded,
"Have
you
been
asked
to
interfere?
Are
you
questioning
me
as
another's
proxy?"
"The
Lord
save
us!
Whoever
weds
thee
must
look
about
him!
Keep
all
your
questions
for
Robert;
I'll
answer
no
more
on
'em.
Good
day,
lassie!"
The
day
being
fine,
or
at
least
fair
for
soft
clouds
curtained
the
sun,
and
a
dim
but
not
chill
or
waterish
haze
slept
blue
on
the
hills
Caroline,

Shirley
was

with

callers,
