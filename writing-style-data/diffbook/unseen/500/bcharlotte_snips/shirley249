which
would
remain
on
Mrs.
Pryor's
mind.
No
effort
of
Shirley's
or
Caroline's
could
efface
it
thence.
She
could
forgive
her
offending
pupil,
not
her
innocent
self.
Miss
Keeldar,
doomed
to
be
in
constant
request
during
the
morning,
was
presently
summoned
downstairs
again.
The
rector
called
first.
A
lively
welcome
and
livelier
reprimand
were
at
his
service.
He
expected
both,
and,
being
in
high
spirits,
took
them
in
equally
good
part.
In
the
course
of
his
brief
visit
he
quite
forgot
to
ask
after
his
niece;
the
riot,
the
rioters,
the
mill,
the
magistrates,
the
heiress,
absorbed
all
his
thoughts
to
the
exclusion
of
family
ties.
He
alluded
to
the
part
himself
and
curate
had
taken
in
the
defence
of
the
Hollow.
"The
vials
of
pharisaical
wrath
will
be
emptied
on
our
heads
for
our
share
in
this
business,"
he
said;
"but
I
defy
every
calumniator.
I
was
there
only
to
support
the
law,
to
play
my
part
as
a
man
and
a
Briton;
which
characters
I
deem
quite
compatible
with
those
of
the
priest
and
Levite,
in
their
highest
sense.
Your
tenant
Moore,"
he
went
on,
"has
won
my
approbation.
A
cooler
commander
I
would
not
wish
to
see,
nor
a
more
determined.
Besides,
the
man
has
shown
sound
judgment
and
good
sense
first,
in
being
thoroughly
prepared
for
the
event
which
has
taken
place;
and
subsequently,
when
his
well
concerted
plans
had
secured
him
success,
in
knowing
how
to
use
without
abusing
his
victory.
Some
of
the
magistrates
are
now
well
frightened,
and,
like
all
cowards,
show
a
tendency
to
be
cruel.
Moore
restrains
them
with
admirable
prudence.
He
has
hitherto
been
very
unpopular
in
the
neighbourhood;
but,
mark
my
words,
the
tide
of
opinion
will
now
take
a
turn
in
his
favour.
People
will
find
out
that
they
have
not
appreciated
him,
and
will
hasten
to
remedy
their
error;
and
he,
when
he
perceives
the
public
disposed
to
acknowledge
his
merits,
will
show
a
more
gracious
mien
than
that
with
which
he
has
hitherto
favoured
us."
Mr.
Helstone
was
about
to
add
to
this
speech
some
half
jesting,
half
serious
warnings
to
Miss
Keeldar
on
the
subject
of
her
rumoured
partiality
for
her
talented
tenant,
when
a
ring
at
the
door,
announcing
another
caller,
checked
his
raillery;
and
as
that
other
caller
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
white
haired
elderly
gentleman,
with
a
rather
truculent
countenance
and
disdainful
eye
in
short,
our
old
acquaintance,
and
the
rector's
old
enemy,
Mr.
Yorke
the
priest
and
Levite
seized
his
hat,
and
with
the
briefest
of
adieus
to
Miss
Keeldar
and
the
sternest
of
nods
to
her
guest
took
an
abrupt
leave.
Mr.
Yorke
was
in
no
mild
mood,
and
in
no
measured
terms
did
he
express
his
opinion
on
the
transaction
of
the
night.
Moore,
the
magistrates,
the
soldiers,
the
mob
leaders,
each
and
all
came
in
for
a
share
of
his
invectives;
but
he
reserved
his
strongest
epithets
and
real
racy
Yorkshire
Doric
adjectives
they
were
for
