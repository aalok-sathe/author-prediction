remainder.
Then
I
am
of
a
peculiar
disposition
I
own
that
far
from
facile,
without
address,
in
some
points
eccentric.
I
ought
never
to
have
married.
Mine
is
not
the
nature
easily
to
find
a
duplicate
or
likely
to
assimilate
with
a
contrast.
I
was
quite
aware
of
my
own
ineligibility;
and
if
I
had
not
been
so
miserable
as
a
governess,
I
never
should
have
married;
and
then
"
Caroline's
eyes
asked
her
to
proceed.
They
entreated
her
to
break
the
thick
cloud
of
despair
which
her
previous
words
had
seemed
to
spread
over
life.
"And
then,
my
dear,
Mr.
that
is,
the
gentleman
I
married
was,
perhaps,
rather
an
exceptional
than
an
average
character.
I
hope,
at
least,
the
experience
of
few
has
been
such
as
mine
was,
or
that
few
have
felt
their
sufferings
as
I
felt
mine.
They
nearly
shook
my
mind;
relief
was
so
hopeless,
redress
so
unattainable.
But,
my
dear,
I
do
not
wish
to
dishearten;
I
only
wish
to
warn
you,
and
to
prove
that
the
single
should
not
be
too
anxious
to
change
their
state,
as
they
may
change
for
the
worse."
"Thank
you,
my
dear
madam.
I
quite
understand
your
kind
intentions,
but
there
is
no
fear
of
my
falling
into
the
error
to
which
you
allude.
I,
at
least,
have
no
thoughts
of
marriage,
and
for
that
reason
I
want
to
make
myself
a
position
by
some
other
means."
"My
dear,
listen
to
me.
On
what
I
am
going
to
say
I
have
carefully
deliberated,
having,
indeed,
revolved
the
subject
in
my
thoughts
ever
since
you
first
mentioned
your
wish
to
obtain
a
situation.
You
know
I
at
present
reside
with
Miss
Keeldar
in
the
capacity
of
companion.
Should
she
marry
(and
that
she
will
marry
ere
long
many
circumstances
induce
me
to
conclude),
I
shall
cease
to
be
necessary
to
her
in
that
capacity.
I
must
tell
you
that
I
possess
a
small
independency,
arising
partly
from
my
own
savings,
and
partly
from
a
legacy
left
me
some
years
since.
Whenever
I
leave
Fieldhead
I
shall
take
a
house
of
my
own.
I
could
not
endure
to
live
in
solitude.
I
have
no
relations
whom
I
care
to
invite
to
close
intimacy;
for,
as
you
must
have
observed,
and
as
I
have
already
avowed,
my
habits
and
tastes
have
their
peculiarities.
To
you,
my
dear,
I
need
not
say
I
am
attached;
with
you
I
am
happier
than
I
have
ever
been
with
any
living
thing"
(this
was
said
with
marked
emphasis).
"Your
society
I
should
esteem
a
very
dear
privilege
an
inestimable
privilege,
a
comfort,
a
blessing.
You
shall
come
to
me,
then.
Caroline,
do
you
refuse
me?
I
hope
you
can
love
me?"
And
with
these
two
abrupt
questions
she
stopped.
"Indeed,
I
do
love
you,"
was
the
reply.
"I
should
like
to
live
with
you.
But
you
are
too
kind."
"All
I
have,"
went
on
Mrs.
Pryor,
"I
would
leave
to
you.
You
should
be
provided
