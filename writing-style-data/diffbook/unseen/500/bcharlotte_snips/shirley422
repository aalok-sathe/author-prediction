permit
me
to
intimate
that
any
further
observations
you
have
to
make
may
as
well
be
addressed
to
me?
Henceforward
I
stand
between
Miss
Keeldar
and
all
annoyance.'
"'You!
What
have
you
to
do
with
Miss
Keeldar?'
"'To
protect,
watch
over,
serve
her.'
"'You,
sir
you,
the
tutor?'
"'Not
one
word
of
insult,
sir,'
interposed
she;
'not
one
syllable
of
disrespect
to
Mr.
Moore
in
this
house.'
"'Do
you
take
his
part?'
"'His
part?
oh
yes!'
"She
turned
to
me
with
a
sudden
fond
movement,
which
I
met
by
circling
her
with
my
arm.
She
and
I
both
rose.
"'Good
Ged!'
was
the
cry
from
the
morning
gown
standing
quivering
at
the
door.
Ged,
I
think,
must
be
the
cognomen
of
Mr.
Sympson's
Lares.
When
hard
pressed
he
always
invokes
this
idol.
"'Come
forward,
uncle;
you
shall
hear
all.
Tell
him
all,
Louis.'
"'I
dare
him
to
speak
the
beggar!
the
knave!
the
specious
hypocrite!
the
vile,
insinuating,
infamous
menial!
Stand
apart
from
my
niece,
sir.
Let
her
go!'
"She
clung
to
me
with
energy.
'I
am
near
my
future
husband,'
she
said.
'Who
dares
touch
him
or
me?'
"'Her
husband!'
He
raised
and
spread
his
hands.
He
dropped
into
a
seat.
"'A
while
ago
you
wanted
much
to
know
whom
I
meant
to
marry.
My
intention
was
then
formed,
but
not
mature
for
communication.
Now
it
is
ripe,
sun
mellowed,
perfect.
Take
the
crimson
peach
take
Louis
Moore!'
"'But'
(savagely)
'you
shall
not
have
him;
he
shall
not
have
you.'
"'I
would
die
before
I
would
have
another.
I
would
die
if
I
might
not
have
him.'
"He
uttered
words
with
which
this
page
shall
never
be
polluted.
"She
turned
white
as
death;
she
shook
all
over;
she
lost
her
strength.
I
laid
her
down
on
the
sofa;
just
looked
to
ascertain
that
she
had
not
fainted
of
which,
with
a
divine
smile,
she
assured
me.
I
kissed
her;
and
then,
if
I
were
to
perish,
I
cannot
give
a
clear
account
of
what
happened
in
the
course
of
the
next
five
minutes.
She
has
since
through
tears,
laughter,
and
trembling
told
me
that
I
turned
terrible,
and
gave
myself
to
the
demon.
She
says
I
left
her,
made
one
bound
across
the
room;
that
Mr.
Sympson
vanished
through
the
door
as
if
shot
from
a
cannon.
I
also
vanished,
and
she
heard
Mrs.
Gill
scream.
"Mrs.
Gill
was
still
screaming
when
I
came
to
my
senses.
I
was
then
in
another
apartment
the
oak
parlour,
I
think.
I
held
Sympson
before
me
crushed
into
a
chair,
and
my
hand
was
on
his
cravat.
His
eyes
rolled
in
his
head;
I
was
strangling
him,
I
think.
The
housekeeper
stood
wringing
her
hands,
entreating
me
to
desist.
I
desisted
that
moment,
and
felt
at
once
as
cool
as
stone.
But
I
told
Mrs.
Gill
to
fetch
the
Red
House
Inn
chaise
instantly,
and
informed
Mr.
Sympson
he
must
depart
from
Fieldhead
the
instant
it
came.
Though
half
frightened
out
