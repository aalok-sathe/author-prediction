miserly;
and
yet
you
are
not,
for
you
give
liberally
to
the
poor
and
to
religious
societies
though
your
gifts
are
conveyed
so
secretly
and
quietly
that
they
are
known
to
few
except
the
receivers.
But
I
will
be
your
lady's
maid
myself.
When
I
get
a
little
stronger
I
will
set
to
work,
and
you
must
be
good,
mamma,
and
do
as
I
bid
you."
And
Caroline,
sitting
near
her
mother,
rearranged
her
muslin
handkerchief
and
resmoothed
her
hair.
"My
own
mamma,"
then
she
went
on,
as
if
pleasing
herself
with
the
thought
of
their
relationship,
"who
belongs
to
me,
and
to
whom
I
belong!
I
am
a
rich
girl
now.
I
have
something
I
can
love
well,
and
not
be
afraid
of
loving.
Mamma,
who
gave
you
this
little
brooch?
Let
me
unpin
it
and
look
at
it."
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
usually
shrank
from
meddling
fingers
and
near
approach,
allowed
the
license
complacently.
"Did
papa
give
you
this,
mamma?"
"My
sister
gave
it
me
my
only
sister,
Cary.
Would
that
your
Aunt
Caroline
had
lived
to
see
her
niece!"
"Have
you
nothing
of
papa's
no
trinket,
no
gift
of
his?"
"I
have
one
thing."
"That
you
prize?"
"That
I
prize."
"Valuable
and
pretty?"
"Invaluable
and
sweet
to
me."
"Show
it,
mamma.
Is
it
here
or
at
Fieldhead?"
"It
is
talking
to
me
now,
leaning
on
me.
Its
arms
are
round
me."
"Ah,
mamma,
you
mean
your
teasing
daughter,
who
will
never
let
you
alone;
who,
when
you
go
into
your
room,
cannot
help
running
to
seek
for
you;
who
follows
you
upstairs
and
down,
like
a
dog."
"Whose
features
still
give
me
such
a
strange
thrill
sometimes.
I
half
fear
your
fair
looks
yet,
child."
"You
don't;
you
can't.
Mamma,
I
am
sorry
papa
was
not
good.
I
do
so
wish
he
had
been.
Wickedness
spoils
and
poisons
all
pleasant
things.
It
kills
love.
If
you
and
I
thought
each
other
wicked,
we
could
not
love
each
other,
could
we?"
"And
if
we
could
not
trust
each
other,
Cary?"
"How
miserable
we
should
be!
Mother,
before
I
knew
you
I
had
an
apprehension
that
you
were
not
good
that
I
could
not
esteem
you.
That
dread
damped
my
wish
to
see
you.
And
now
my
heart
is
elate
because
I
find
you
perfect
almost;
kind,
clever,
nice.
Your
sole
fault
is
that
you
are
old
fashioned,
and
of
that
I
shall
cure
you.
Mamma,
put
your
work
down;
read
to
me.
I
like
your
southern
accent;
it
is
so
pure,
so
soft.
It
has
no
rugged
burr,
no
nasal
twang,
such
as
almost
every
one's
voice
here
in
the
north
has.
My
uncle
and
Mr.
Hall
say
that
you
are
a
fine
reader,
mamma.
Mr.
Hall
said
he
never
heard
any
lady
read
with
such
propriety
of
expression
or
purity
of
accent."
"I
wish
I
could
reciprocate
the
compliment,
Cary;
but,
really,
the
first
time
I
heard
your
truly
excellent
friend
read
and
preach
I
could
not
understand
