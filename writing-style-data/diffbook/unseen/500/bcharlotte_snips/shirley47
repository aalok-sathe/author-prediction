generally
return
at
seven.
Do
you
wish
me
to
be
at
home
earlier?"
"Try
rather
to
be
back
by
six.
It
is
not
absolutely
dark
at
six
now,
but
by
seven
daylight
is
quite
gone."
"And
what
danger
is
to
be
apprehended,
Caroline,
when
daylight
is
gone?
What
peril
do
you
conceive
comes
as
the
companion
of
darkness
for
me?"
"I
am
not
sure
that
I
can
define
my
fears,
but
we
all
have
a
certain
anxiety
at
present
about
our
friends.
My
uncle
calls
these
times
dangerous.
He
says,
too,
that
mill
owners
are
unpopular."
"And
I
am
one
of
the
most
unpopular?
Is
not
that
the
fact?
You
are
reluctant
to
speak
out
plainly,
but
at
heart
you
think
me
liable
to
Pearson's
fate,
who
was
shot
at
not,
indeed,
from
behind
a
hedge,
but
in
his
own
house,
through
his
staircase
window,
as
he
was
going
to
bed."
"Anne
Pearson
showed
me
the
bullet
in
the
chamber
door,"
remarked
Caroline
gravely,
as
she
folded
her
mantle
and
arranged
it
and
her
muff
on
a
side
table.
"You
know,"
she
continued,
"there
is
a
hedge
all
the
way
along
the
road
from
here
to
Whinbury,
and
there
are
the
Fieldhead
plantations
to
pass;
but
you
will
be
back
by
six
or
before?"
"Certainly
he
will,"
affirmed
Hortense.
"And
now,
my
child,
prepare
your
lessons
for
repetition,
while
I
put
the
peas
to
soak
for
the
puree
at
dinner."
With
this
direction
she
left
the
room.
"You
suspect
I
have
many
enemies,
then,
Caroline,"
said
Mr.
Moore,
"and
doubtless
you
know
me
to
be
destitute
of
friends?"
"Not
destitute,
Robert.
There
is
your
sister,
your
brother
Louis,
whom
I
have
never
seen;
there
is
Mr.
Yorke,
and
there
is
my
uncle
besides,
of
course,
many
more."
Robert
smiled.
"You
would
be
puzzled
to
name
your
'many
more,'"
said
he.
"But
show
me
your
exercise
book.
What
extreme
pains
you
take
with
the
writing!
My
sister,
I
suppose,
exacts
this
care.
She
wants
to
form
you
in
all
things
after
the
model
of
a
Flemish
school
girl.
What
life
are
you
destined
for,
Caroline?
What
will
you
do
with
your
French,
drawing,
and
other
accomplishments,
when
they
are
acquired?"
"You
may
well
say,
when
they
are
acquired;
for,
as
you
are
aware,
till
Hortense
began
to
teach
me,
I
knew
precious
little.
As
to
the
life
I
am
destined
for,
I
cannot
tell.
I
suppose
to
keep
my
uncle's
house
till
"
She
hesitated.
"Till
what?
Till
he
dies?"
"No.
How
harsh
to
say
that!
I
never
think
of
his
dying.
He
is
only
fifty
five.
But
till
in
short,
till
events
offer
other
occupations
for
me."
"A
remarkably
vague
prospect!
Are
you
content
with
it?"
"I
used
to
be,
formerly.
Children,
you
know,
have
little
reflection,
or
rather
their
reflections
run
on
ideal
themes.
There
are
moments
now
when
I
am
not
quite
satisfied."
"Why?"
"I
am
making
no
money
earning
nothing."
"You
come
to
the
point,
Lina.
You
