returning
from
market,
I
encountered
him
and
Moses
Barraclough,
both
in
an
advanced
stage
of
inebriation.
They
were
praying
in
frantic
sort
at
the
roadside.
They
accosted
me
as
Satan,
bid
me
avaunt,
and
clamoured
to
be
delivered
from
temptation.
Again,
but
a
few
days
ago,
Michael
took
the
trouble
of
appearing
at
the
counting
house
door,
hatless,
in
his
shirt
sleeves
his
coat
and
castor
having
been
detained
at
the
public
house
in
pledge.
He
delivered
himself
of
the
comfortable
message
that
he
could
wish
Mr.
Moore
to
set
his
house
in
order,
as
his
soul
was
likely
shortly
to
be
required
of
him."
"Do
you
make
light
of
these
things?"
"The
poor
man
had
been
drinking
for
weeks,
and
was
in
a
state
bordering
on
delirium
tremens."
"What
then?
He
is
the
more
likely
to
attempt
the
fulfilment
of
his
own
prophecies."
"It
would
not
do
to
permit
incidents
of
this
sort
to
affect
one's
nerves."
"Mr.
Moore,
go
home!"
"So
soon?"
"Pass
straight
down
the
fields,
not
round
by
the
lade
and
plantations."
"It
is
early
yet."
"It
is
late.
For
my
part,
I
am
going
in.
Will
you
promise
me
not
to
wander
in
the
Hollow
to
night?"
"If
you
wish
it."
"I
do
wish
it.
May
I
ask
whether
you
consider
life
valueless?"
"By
no
means.
On
the
contrary,
of
late
I
regard
my
life
as
invaluable."
"Of
late?"
"Existence
is
neither
aimless
nor
hopeless
to
me
now,
and
it
was
both
three
months
ago.
I
was
then
drowning,
and
rather
wished
the
operation
over.
All
at
once
a
hand
was
stretched
to
me
such
a
delicate
hand
I
scarcely
dared
trust
it;
its
strength,
however,
has
rescued
me
from
ruin."
"Are
you
really
rescued?"
"For
the
time.
Your
assistance
has
given
me
another
chance."
"Live
to
make
the
best
of
it.
Don't
offer
yourself
as
a
target
to
Michael
Hartley;
and
good
night!"
Miss
Helstone
was
under
a
promise
to
spend
the
evening
of
the
next
day
at
Fieldhead.
She
kept
her
promise.
Some
gloomy
hours
had
she
spent
in
the
interval.
Most
of
the
time
had
been
passed
shut
up
in
her
own
apartment,
only
issuing
from
it,
indeed,
to
join
her
uncle
at
meals,
and
anticipating
inquiries
from
Fanny
by
telling
her
that
she
was
busy
altering
a
dress,
and
preferred
sewing
upstairs,
to
avoid
interruption.
She
did
sew.
She
plied
her
needle
continuously,
ceaselessly,
but
her
brain
worked
faster
than
her
fingers.
Again,
and
more
intensely
than
ever,
she
desired
a
fixed
occupation,
no
matter
how
onerous,
how
irksome.
Her
uncle
must
be
once
more
entreated,
but
first
she
would
consult
Mrs.
Pryor.
Her
head
laboured
to
frame
projects
as
diligently
as
her
hands
to
plait
and
stitch
the
thin
texture
of
the
muslin
summer
dress
spread
on
the
little
white
couch
at
the
foot
of
which
she
sat.
Now
and
then,
while
thus
doubly
occupied,
a
tear
would
fill
her
eyes
and
fall
on
her
busy
hands;
but
this
sign
