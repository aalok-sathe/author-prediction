something
more
than
the
shrubs
before
they
turned
from
that
limited
prospect.
They
longed
to
see
a
human
figure,
of
a
certain
mould
and
height,
pass
the
hedge
and
enter
the
gate.
A
human
figure
she
at
last
saw
nay,
two.
Frederick
Murgatroyd
went
by,
carrying
a
pail
of
water;
Joe
Scott
followed,
dangling
on
his
forefinger
the
keys
of
the
mill.
They
were
going
to
lock
up
mill
and
stables
for
the
night,
and
then
betake
themselves
home.
"So
must
I,"
thought
Caroline,
as
she
half
rose
and
sighed.
"This
is
all
folly
heart
breaking
folly,"
she
added.
"In
the
first
place,
though
I
should
stay
till
dark
there
will
be
no
arrival;
because
I
feel
in
my
heart,
Fate
has
written
it
down
in
to
day's
page
of
her
eternal
book,
that
I
am
not
to
have
the
pleasure
I
long
for.
In
the
second
place,
if
he
stepped
in
this
moment,
my
presence
here
would
be
a
chagrin
to
him,
and
the
consciousness
that
it
must
be
so
would
turn
half
my
blood
to
ice.
His
hand
would,
perhaps,
be
loose
and
chill
if
I
put
mine
into
it;
his
eye
would
be
clouded
if
I
sought
its
beam.
I
should
look
up
for
that
kindling,
something
I
have
seen
in
past
days,
when
my
face,
or
my
language,
or
my
disposition
had
at
some
happy
moment
pleased
him;
I
should
discover
only
darkness.
I
had
better
go
home."
She
took
her
bonnet
from
the
table
where
it
lay,
and
was
just
fastening
the
ribbon,
when
Hortense,
directing
her
attention
to
a
splendid
bouquet
of
flowers
in
a
glass
on
the
same
table,
mentioned
that
Miss
Keeldar
had
sent
them
that
morning
from
Fieldhead;
and
went
on
to
comment
on
the
guests
that
lady
was
at
present
entertaining,
on
the
bustling
life
she
had
lately
been
leading;
adding
divers
conjectures
that
she
did
not
very
well
like
it,
and
much
wonderment
that
a
person
who
was
so
fond
of
her
own
way
as
the
heiress
did
not
find
some
means
of
sooner
getting
rid
of
this
cortege
of
relatives.
"But
they
say
she
actually
will
not
let
Mr.
Sympson
and
his
family
go,"
she
added.
"They
wanted
much
to
return
to
the
south
last
week,
to
be
ready
for
the
reception
of
the
only
son,
who
is
expected
home
from
a
tour.
She
insists
that
her
cousin
Henry
shall
come
and
join
his
friends
here
in
Yorkshire.
I
dare
say
she
partly
does
it
to
oblige
Robert
and
myself."
"How
to
oblige
Robert
and
you?"
inquired
Caroline.
"Why,
my
child,
you
are
dull.
Don't
you
know
you
must
often
have
heard
"
"Please,
ma'am,"
said
Sarah,
opening
the
door,
"the
preserves
that
you
told
me
to
boil
in
treacle
the
congfiters,
as
you
call
them
is
all
burnt
to
the
pan."
"Les
confitures!
Elles
sont
brulees?
Ah,
quelle
negligence
coupable!
Coquine
de
cuisiniere,
fille
insupportable!"
And
mademoiselle,
hastily
taking
from
a
drawer
a
large
linen
apron,
and
