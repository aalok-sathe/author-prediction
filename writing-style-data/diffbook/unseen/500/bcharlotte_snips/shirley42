and
began
to
work
in
the
garden.
For
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
dug
on
uninterrupted.
At
length,
however,
a
window
opened,
and
a
female
voice
called
to
him,
"Eh,
bien!
Tu
ne
dejeunes
pas
ce
matin?"
The
answer,
and
the
rest
of
the
conversation,
was
in
French;
but
as
this
is
an
English
book,
I
shall
translate
it
into
English.
"Is
breakfast
ready,
Hortense?"
"Certainly;
it
has
been
ready
half
an
hour."
"Then
I
am
ready
too.
I
have
a
canine
hunger."
He
threw
down
his
spade,
and
entered
the
house.
The
narrow
passage
conducted
him
to
a
small
parlour,
where
a
breakfast
of
coffee
and
bread
and
butter,
with
the
somewhat
un
English
accompaniment
of
stewed
pears,
was
spread
on
the
table.
Over
these
viands
presided
the
lady
who
had
spoken
from
the
window.
I
must
describe
her
before
I
go
any
farther.
She
seemed
a
little
older
than
Mr.
Moore
perhaps
she
was
thirty
five,
tall,
and
proportionately
stout;
she
had
very
black
hair,
for
the
present
twisted
up
in
curl
papers,
a
high
colour
in
her
cheeks,
a
small
nose,
a
pair
of
little
black
eyes.
The
lower
part
of
her
face
was
large
in
proportion
to
the
upper;
her
forehead
was
small
and
rather
corrugated;
she
had
a
fretful
though
not
an
ill
natured
expression
of
countenance;
there
was
something
in
her
whole
appearance
one
felt
inclined
to
be
half
provoked
with
and
half
amused
at.
The
strangest
point
was
her
dress
a
stuff
petticoat
and
a
striped
cotton
camisole.
The
petticoat
was
short,
displaying
well
a
pair
of
feet
and
ankles
which
left
much
to
be
desired
in
the
article
of
symmetry.
You
will
think
I
have
depicted
a
remarkable
slattern,
reader.
Not
at
all.
Hortense
Moore
(she
was
Mr.
Moore's
sister)
was
a
very
orderly,
economical
person.
The
petticoat,
camisole,
and
curl
papers
were
her
morning
costume,
in
which,
of
forenoons,
she
had
always
been
accustomed
to
"go
her
household
ways"
in
her
own
country.
She
did
not
choose
to
adopt
English
fashions
because
she
was
obliged
to
live
in
England;
she
adhered
to
her
old
Belgian
modes,
quite
satisfied
that
there
was
a
merit
in
so
doing.
Mademoiselle
had
an
excellent
opinion
of
herself
an
opinion
not
wholly
undeserved,
for
she
possessed
some
good
and
sterling
qualities;
but
she
rather
over
estimated
the
kind
and
degree
of
these
qualities,
and
quite
left
out
of
the
account
sundry
little
defects
which
accompanied
them.
You
could
never
have
persuaded
her
that
she
was
a
prejudiced
and
narrow
minded
person,
that
she
was
too
susceptible
on
the
subject
of
her
own
dignity
and
importance,
and
too
apt
to
take
offence
about
trifles;
yet
all
this
was
true.
However,
where
her
claims
to
distinction
were
not
opposed,
and
where
her
prejudices
were
not
offended,
she
could
be
kind
and
friendly
enough.
To
her
two
brothers
(for
there
was
another
Gerard
Moore
besides
Robert)
she
was
very
much
attached.

sole
