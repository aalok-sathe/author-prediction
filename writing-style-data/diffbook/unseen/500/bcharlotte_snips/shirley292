"You
are
weeping
at
the
pathos
of
the
air.
Come
here,
and
I
will
comfort
you,"
said
Caroline,
in
a
pitying
accent.
Mrs.
Pryor
came.
She
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
her
patient's
bed,
and
allowed
the
wasted
arms
to
encircle
her.
"You
often
soothe
me;
let
me
soothe
you,"
murmured
the
young
girl,
kissing
her
cheek.
"I
hope,"
she
added,
"it
is
not
for
me
you
weep?"
No
answer
followed.
"Do
you
think
I
shall
not
get
better?
I
do
not
feel
very
ill
only
weak."
"But
your
mind,
Caroline
your
mind
is
crushed.
Your
heart
is
almost
broken;
you
have
been
so
neglected,
so
repulsed,
left
so
desolate."
"I
believe
grief
is,
and
always
has
been,
my
worst
ailment.
I
sometimes
think
if
an
abundant
gush
of
happiness
came
on
me
I
could
revive
yet."
"Do
you
wish
to
live?"
"I
have
no
object
in
life."
"You
love
me,
Caroline?"
"Very
much
very
truly
inexpressibly
sometimes.
Just
now
I
feel
as
if
I
could
almost
grow
to
your
heart."
"I
will
return
directly,
dear,"
remarked
Mrs.
Pryor,
as
she
laid
Caroline
down.
Quitting
her,
she
glided
to
the
door,
softly
turned
the
key
in
the
lock,
ascertained
that
it
was
fast,
and
came
back.
She
bent
over
her.
She
threw
back
the
curtain
to
admit
the
moonlight
more
freely.
She
gazed
intently
on
her
face.
"Then,
if
you
love
me,"
said
she,
speaking
quickly,
with
an
altered
voice;
"if
you
feel
as
if,
to
use
your
own
words,
you
could
'grow
to
my
heart,'
it
will
be
neither
shock
nor
pain
for
you
to
know
that
that
heart
is
the
source
whence
yours
was
filled;
that
from
my
veins
issued
the
tide
which
flows
in
yours;
that
you
are
mine
my
daughter
my
own
child."
"Mrs.
Pryor
"
"My
own
child!"
"That
is
that
means
you
have
adopted
me?"
"It
means
that,
if
I
have
given
you
nothing
else,
I
at
least
gave
you
life;
that
I
bore
you,
nursed
you;
that
I
am
your
true
mother.
No
other
woman
can
claim
the
title;
it
is
mine."
"But
Mrs.
James
Helstone
but
my
father's
wife,
whom
I
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
seen,
she
is
my
mother?"
"She
is
your
mother.
James
Helstone
was
my
husband.
I
say
you
are
mine.
I
have
proved
it.
I
thought
perhaps
you
were
all
his,
which
would
have
been
a
cruel
dispensation
for
me.
I
find
it
is
not
so.
God
permitted
me
to
be
the
parent
of
my
child's
mind.
It
belongs
to
me;
it
is
my
property
my
right.
These
features
are
James's
own.
He
had
a
fine
face
when
he
was
young,
and
not
altered
by
error.
Papa,
my
darling,
gave
you
your
blue
eyes
and
soft
brown
hair;
he
gave
you
the
oval
of
your
face
and
the
regularity
of
your
lineaments
the
outside
he
conferred;
but
the
heart
and
the
brain
are
mine.
The
germs
are
from
me,
and
they
are
improved,
they
are
