gray
haired.
My
two
venerable
favourites,
Mr.
Helstone
and
Mr.
Yorke,
it
is
true,
are
fine
old
beaus,
infinitely
better
than
any
of
the
stupid
young
ones."
Mrs.
Pryor
was
silent.
"You
do
not
like
Mr.
Helstone,
ma'am?"
"My
dear,
Mr.
Helstone's
office
secures
him
from
criticism."
"You
generally
contrive
to
leave
the
room
when
he
is
announced."
"Do
you
walk
out
this
morning,
my
dear?"
"Yes,
I
shall
go
to
the
rectory,
and
seek
and
find
Caroline
Helstone,
and
make
her
take
some
exercise.
She
shall
have
a
breezy
walk
over
Nunnely
Common."
"If
you
go
in
that
direction,
my
dear,
have
the
goodness
to
remind
Miss
Helstone
to
wrap
up
well,
as
there
is
a
fresh
wind,
and
she
appears
to
me
to
require
care."
"You
shall
be
minutely
obeyed,
Mrs.
Pryor.
Meantime,
will
you
not
accompany
us
yourself?"
"No,
my
love;
I
should
be
a
restraint
upon
you.
I
am
stout,
and
cannot
walk
so
quickly
as
you
would
wish
to
do."
Shirley
easily
persuaded
Caroline
to
go
with
her,
and
when
they
were
fairly
out
on
the
quiet
road,
traversing
the
extensive
and
solitary
sweep
of
Nunnely
Common,
she
as
easily
drew
her
into
conversation.
The
first
feelings
of
diffidence
overcome,
Caroline
soon
felt
glad
to
talk
with
Miss
Keeldar.
The
very
first
interchange
of
slight
observations
sufficed
to
give
each
an
idea
of
what
the
other
was.
Shirley
said
she
liked
the
green
sweep
of
the
common
turf,
and,
better
still,
the
heath
on
its
ridges,
for
the
heath
reminded
her
of
moors.
She
had
seen
moors
when
she
was
travelling
on
the
borders
near
Scotland.
She
remembered
particularly
a
district
traversed
one
long
afternoon,
on
a
sultry
but
sunless
day
in
summer.
They
journeyed
from
noon
till
sunset,
over
what
seemed
a
boundless
waste
of
deep
heath,
and
nothing
had
they
seen
but
wild
sheep,
nothing
heard
but
the
cries
of
wild
birds.
"I
know
how
the
heath
would
look
on
such
a
day,"
said
Caroline;
"purple
black
a
deeper
shade
of
the
sky
tint,
and
that
would
be
livid."
"Yes,
quite
livid,
with
brassy
edges
to
the
clouds,
and
here
and
there
a
white
gleam,
more
ghastly
than
the
lurid
tinge,
which,
as
you
looked
at
it,
you
momentarily
expected
would
kindle
into
blinding
lightning."
"Did
it
thunder?"
"It
muttered
distant
peals,
but
the
storm
did
not
break
till
evening,
after
we
had
reached
our
inn
that
inn
being
an
isolated
house
at
the
foot
of
a
range
of
mountains."
"Did
you
watch
the
clouds
come
down
over
the
mountains?"
"I
did.
I
stood
at
the
window
an
hour
watching
them.
The
hills
seemed
rolled
in
a
sullen
mist,
and
when
the
rain
fell
in
whitening
sheets,
suddenly
they
were
blotted
from
the
prospect;
they
were
washed
from
the
world."
"I
have
seen
such
storms
in
hilly
districts
in
Yorkshire;
and
at
their
riotous
climax,
while
the
sky
was
all
cataract,
the
earth
all
flood,
I
have
remembered
the
Deluge."
"It
is
singularly
