he
liked
both
to
frighten
and
to
rouse
them.
He
liked
to
force
them
to
betray
a
certain
fear,
which
made
them
alike
falter
in
resolve
and
recoil
in
action
the
fear,
simply,
of
assassination.
This,
indeed,
was
the
dread
which
had
hitherto
hampered
every
manufacturer
and
almost
every
public
man
in
the
district.
Helstone
alone
had
ever
repelled
it.
The
old
Cossack
knew
well
he
might
be
shot.
He
knew
there
was
risk;
but
such
death
had
for
his
nerves
no
terrors.
It
would
have
been
his
chosen,
might
he
have
had
a
choice.
Moore
likewise
knew
his
danger.
The
result
was
an
unquenchable
scorn
of
the
quarter
whence
such
danger
was
to
be
apprehended.
The
consciousness
that
he
hunted
assassins
was
the
spur
in
his
high
mettled
temper's
flank.
As
for
fear,
he
was
too
proud,
too
hard
natured
(if
you
will),
too
phlegmatic
a
man
to
fear.
Many
a
time
he
rode
belated
over
the
moors,
moonlit
or
moonless
as
the
case
might
be,
with
feelings
far
more
elate,
faculties
far
better
refreshed,
than
when
safety
and
stagnation
environed
him
in
the
counting
house.
Four
was
the
number
of
the
leaders
to
be
accounted
for.
Two,
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight,
were
brought
to
bay
near
Stilbro';
the
remaining
two
it
was
necessary
to
seek
farther
off.
Their
haunts
were
supposed
to
lie
near
Birmingham.
Meantime
the
clothier
did
not
neglect
his
battered
mill.
Its
reparation
was
esteemed
a
light
task,
carpenters'
and
glaziers'
work
alone
being
needed.
The
rioters
not
having
succeeded
in
effecting
an
entrance,
his
grim
metal
darlings
the
machines
had
escaped
damage.
Whether
during
this
busy
life
whether
while
stern
justice
and
exacting
business
claimed
his
energies
and
harassed
his
thoughts
he
now
and
then
gave
one
moment,
dedicated
one
effort,
to
keep
alive
gentler
fires
than
those
which
smoulder
in
the
fane
of
Nemesis,
it
was
not
easy
to
discover.
He
seldom
went
near
Fieldhead;
if
he
did,
his
visits
were
brief.
If
he
called
at
the
rectory,
it
was
only
to
hold
conferences
with
the
rector
in
his
study.
He
maintained
his
rigid
course
very
steadily.
Meantime
the
history
of
the
year
continued
troubled.
There
was
no
lull
in
the
tempest
of
war;
her
long
hurricane
still
swept
the
Continent.
There
was
not
the
faintest
sign
of
serene
weather,
no
opening
amid
"the
clouds
of
battle
dust
and
smoke,"
no
fall
of
pure
dews
genial
to
the
olive,
no
cessation
of
the
red
rain
which
nourishes
the
baleful
and
glorious
laurel.
Meantime,
Ruin
had
her
sappers
and
miners
at
work
under
Moore's
feet,
and
whether
he
rode
or
walked,
whether
he
only
crossed
his
counting
house
hearth
or
galloped
over
sullen
Rushedge,
he
was
aware
of
a
hollow
echo,
and
felt
the
ground
shake
to
his
tread.
While
the
summer
thus
passed
with
Moore,
how
did
it
lapse
with
Shirley
and
Caroline?
Let
us
first
visit
the
heiress.
How
does
she
look?
Like
a
love
lorn
maiden,
pale
and
pining
