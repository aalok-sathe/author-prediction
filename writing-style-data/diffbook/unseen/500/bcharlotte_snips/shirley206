to
do
good.
It
was
a
day
of
happiness
for
rich
and
poor
the
work,
first
of
God,
and
then
of
the
clergy.
Let
England's
priests
have
their
due.
They
are
a
faulty
set
in
some
respects,
being
only
of
common
flesh
and
blood
like
us
all;
but
the
land
would
be
badly
off
without
them.
Britain
would
miss
her
church,
if
that
church
fell.
God
save
it!
God
also
reform
it!
Not
on
combat
bent,
nor
of
foemen
in
search,
was
this
priest
led
and
woman
officered
company;
yet
their
music
played
martial
tunes,
and,
to
judge
by
the
eyes
and
carriage
of
some
Miss
Keeldar,
for
instance
these
sounds
awoke,
if
not
a
martial,
yet
a
longing
spirit.
Old
Helstone,
turning
by
chance,
looked
into
her
face;
and
he
laughed,
and
she
laughed
at
him.
"There
is
no
battle
in
prospect,"
he
said;
"our
country
does
not
want
us
to
fight
for
it.
No
foe
or
tyrant
is
questioning
or
threatening
our
liberty.
There
is
nothing
to
be
done.
We
are
only
taking
a
walk.
Keep
your
hand
on
the
reins,
captain,
and
slack
the
fire
of
that
spirit.
It
is
not
wanted,
the
more's
the
pity."
"Take
your
own
advice,
doctor,"
was
Shirley's
response.
To
Caroline
she
murmured,
"I'll
borrow
of
imagination
what
reality
will
not
give
me.
We
are
not
soldiers
bloodshed
is
not
my
desire
or
if
we
are,
we
are
soldiers
of
the
Cross.
Time
has
rolled
back
some
hundreds
of
years,
and
we
are
bound
on
a
pilgrimage
to
Palestine.
But
no;
that
is
too
visionary.
I
need
a
sterner
dream.
We
are
Lowlanders
of
Scotland,
following
a
Covenanting
captain
up
into
the
hills
to
hold
a
meeting
out
of
the
reach
of
persecuting
troopers.
We
know
that
battle
may
follow
prayer;
and
as
we
believe
that
in
the
worst
issue
of
battle
heaven
must
be
our
reward,
we
are
ready
and
willing
to
redden
the
peat
moss
with
our
blood.
That
music
stirs
my
soul;
it
wakens
all
my
life;
it
makes
my
heart
beat
not
with
its
temperate
daily
pulse,
but
with
a
new,
thrilling
vigour.
I
almost
long
for
danger
for
a
faith,
a
land,
or
at
least
a
lover
to
defend."
"Look,
Shirley!"
interrupted
Caroline.
"What
is
that
red
speck
above
Stilbro'
Brow?
You
have
keener
sight
than
I.
Just
turn
your
eagle
eye
to
it."
Miss
Keeldar
looked.
"I
see,"
she
said;
then
added
presently,
"there
is
a
line
of
red.
They
are
soldiers
cavalry
soldiers,"
she
subjoined
quickly.
"They
ride
fast.
There
are
six
of
them.
They
will
pass
us.
No;
they
have
turned
off
to
the
right.
They
saw
our
procession,
and
avoid
it
by
making
a
circuit.
Where
are
they
going?"
"Perhaps
they
are
only
exercising
their
horses."
"Perhaps
so.
We
see
them
no
more
now."
Mr.
Helstone
here
spoke.
"We
shall
pass
through
Royd
Lane,
to
reach
Nunnely
Common
by
a
short
cut,"
said
he.
And
into
the
straits
of
Royd
Lane
they
accordingly
