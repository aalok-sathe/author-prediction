but
where
four
such
natures
as
Mr.
Hall,
David
Sweeting,
Shirley,
and
Caroline
were
assembled
in
health
and
amity,
on
a
green
lawn,
under
a
sunny
sky,
amidst
a
wilderness
of
flowers,
there
could
not
be
ungenial
dullness.
In
the
course
of
conversation
Mr.
Hall
reminded
the
ladies
that
Whitsuntide
was
approaching,
when
the
grand
united
Sunday
school
tea
drinking
and
procession
of
the
three
parishes
of
Briarfield,
Whinbury,
and
Nunnely
were
to
take
place.
Caroline,
he
knew,
would
be
at
her
post
as
teacher,
he
said,
and
he
hoped
Miss
Keeldar
would
not
be
wanting.
He
hoped
she
would
make
her
first
public
appearance
amongst
them
at
that
time.
Shirley
was
not
the
person
to
miss
an
occasion
of
this
sort.
She
liked
festive
excitement,
a
gathering
of
happiness,
a
concentration
and
combination
of
pleasant
details,
a
throng
of
glad
faces,
a
muster
of
elated
hearts.
She
told
Mr.
Hall
they
might
count
on
her
with
security.
She
did
not
know
what
she
would
have
to
do,
but
they
might
dispose
of
her
as
they
pleased.
"And,"
said
Caroline,
"you
will
promise
to
come
to
my
table,
and
to
sit
near
me,
Mr.
Hall?"
"I
shall
not
fail,
Deo
volente,"
said
he.
"I
have
occupied
the
place
on
her
right
hand
at
these
monster
tea
drinkings
for
the
last
six
years,"
he
proceeded,
turning
to
Miss
Keeldar.
"They
made
her
a
Sunday
school
teacher
when
she
was
a
little
girl
of
twelve.
She
is
not
particularly
self
confident
by
nature,
as
you
may
have
observed;
and
the
first
time
she
had
to
'take
a
tray,'
as
the
phrase
is,
and
make
tea
in
public,
there
was
some
piteous
trembling
and
flushing.
I
observed
the
speechless
panic,
the
cups
shaking
in
the
little
hand,
and
the
overflowing
teapot
filled
too
full
from
the
urn.
I
came
to
her
aid,
took
a
seat
near
her,
managed
the
urn
and
the
slop
basin,
and
in
fact
made
the
tea
for
her
like
any
old
woman."
"I
was
very
grateful
to
you,"
interposed
Caroline.
"You
were.
You
told
me
so
with
an
earnest
sincerity
that
repaid
me
well,
inasmuch
as
it
was
not
like
the
majority
of
little
ladies
of
twelve,
whom
you
may
help
and
caress
for
ever
without
their
evincing
any
quicker
sense
of
the
kindness
done
and
meant
than
if
they
were
made
of
wax
and
wood
instead
of
flesh
and
nerves.
She
kept
close
to
me,
Miss
Keeldar,
the
rest
of
the
evening,
walking
with
me
over
the
grounds
where
the
children
were
playing;
she
followed
me
into
the
vestry
when
all
were
summoned
into
church;
she
would,
I
believe,
have
mounted
with
me
to
the
pulpit,
had
I
not
taken
the
previous
precaution
of
conducting
her
to
the
rectory
pew."
"And
he
has
been
my
friend
ever
since,"
said
Caroline.
"And
always
sat
at
her
table,
near
her
tray,
and
handed
the
cups
that
is
the
extent
of
my
services.
The
next
thing
I
do
for
her
will
