on
hillside,
house
front,
tree
bole,
on
winding
road
and
undulating
pasture
ground.
The
two
girls
came
down
from
the
fields
slowly.
By
the
time
they
reached
the
churchyard
the
bells
were
hushed;
the
multitudes
were
gathered
into
the
church.
The
whole
scene
was
solitary.
"How
pleasant
and
calm
it
is!"
said
Caroline.
"And
how
hot
it
will
be
in
the
church!"
responded
Shirley.
"And
what
a
dreary
long
speech
Dr.
Boultby
will
make!
And
how
the
curates
will
hammer
over
their
prepared
orations!
For
my
part,
I
would
rather
not
enter."
"But
my
uncle
will
be
angry
if
he
observes
our
absence."
"I
will
bear
the
brunt
of
his
wrath;
he
will
not
devour
me.
I
shall
be
sorry
to
miss
his
pungent
speech.
I
know
it
will
be
all
sense
for
the
church,
and
all
causticity
for
schism.
He'll
not
forget
the
battle
of
Royd
Lane.
I
shall
be
sorry
also
to
deprive
you
of
Mr.
Hall's
sincere
friendly
homily,
with
all
its
racy
Yorkshireisms;
but
here
I
must
stay.
The
gray
church
and
grayer
tombs
look
divine
with
this
crimson
gleam
on
them.
Nature
is
now
at
her
evening
prayers;
she
is
kneeling
before
those
red
hills.
I
see
her
prostrate
on
the
great
steps
of
her
altar,
praying
for
a
fair
night
for
mariners
at
sea,
for
travellers
in
deserts,
for
lambs
on
moors,
and
unfledged
birds
in
woods.
Caroline,
I
see
her,
and
I
will
tell
you
what
she
is
like.
She
is
like
what
Eve
was
when
she
and
Adam
stood
alone
on
earth."
"And
that
is
not
Milton's
Eve,
Shirley."
"Milton's
Eve!
Milton's
Eve!
I
repeat.
No,
by
the
pure
Mother
of
God,
she
is
not!
Cary,
we
are
alone;
we
may
speak
what
we
think.
Milton
was
great;
but
was
he
good?
His
brain
was
right;
how
was
his
heart?
He
saw
heaven;
he
looked
down
on
hell.
He
saw
Satan,
and
Sin
his
daughter,
and
Death
their
horrible
offspring.
Angels
serried
before
him
their
battalions;
the
long
lines
of
adamantine
shields
flashed
back
on
his
blind
eyeballs
the
unutterable
splendour
of
heaven.
Devils
gathered
their
legions
in
his
sight;
their
dim,
discrowned,
and
tarnished
armies
passed
rank
and
file
before
him.
Milton
tried
to
see
the
first
woman;
but,
Cary,
he
saw
her
not."
"You
are
bold
to
say
so,
Shirley."
"Not
more
bold
than
faithful.
It
was
his
cook
that
he
saw;
or
it
was
Mrs.
Gill,
as
I
have
seen
her,
making
custards,
in
the
heat
of
summer,
in
the
cool
dairy,
with
rose
trees
and
nasturtiums
about
the
latticed
window,
preparing
a
cold
collation
for
the
rectors
preserves
and
'dulcet
creams;'
puzzled
'what
choice
to
choose
for
delicacy
best;
what
order
so
contrived
as
not
to
mix
tastes,
not
well
joined,
inelegant,
but
bring
taste
after
taste,
upheld
with
kindliest
change.'"
"All
very
well
too,
Shirley."
"I
would
beg
to
remind
him
that
the
first
men
of
the
earth
were
Titans,
and
that
Eve
was
their
mother;
