blue
of
heaven
above,
pours
a
wondrous
descent,
dread
as
the
downrushing
of
stars.
He
has
what
he
asked.
Withdraw
forbear
to
look
I
am
blinded.
I
hear
in
that
fane
an
unspeakable
sound.
Would
that
I
could
not
hear
it!
I
see
an
insufferable
glory
burning
terribly
between
the
pillars.
Gods
be
merciful
and
quench
it!
"A
pious
Argive
enters
to
make
an
early
offering
in
the
cool
dawn
of
morning.
There
was
thunder
in
the
night;
the
bolt
fell
here.
The
shrine
is
shivered,
the
marble
pavement
round
split
and
blackened.
Saturnia's
statue
rises
chaste,
grand,
untouched;
at
her
feet
piled
ashes
lie
pale.
No
priest
remains;
he
who
watched
will
be
seen
no
more.
"There
is
the
carriage!
Let
me
lock
up
the
desk
and
pocket
the
keys.
She
will
be
seeking
them
to
morrow;
she
will
have
to
come
to
me.
I
hear
her:
'Mr.
Moore,
have
you
seen
my
keys?'
"So
she
will
say,
in
her
clear
voice,
speaking
with
reluctance,
looking
ashamed,
conscious
that
this
is
the
twentieth
time
of
asking.
I
will
tantalize
her,
keep
her
with
me,
expecting,
doubting;
and
when
I
do
restore
them,
it
shall
not
be
without
a
lecture.
Here
is
the
bag,
too,
and
the
purse;
the
glove
pen
seal.
She
shall
wring
them
all
out
of
me
slowly
and
separately
only
by
confession,
penitence,
entreaty.
I
never
can
touch
her
hand,
or
a
ringlet
of
her
head,
or
a
ribbon
of
her
dress,
but
I
will
make
privileges
for
myself.
Every
feature
of
her
face,
her
bright
eyes,
her
lips,
shall
go
through
each
change
they
know,
for
my
pleasure
display
each
exquisite
variety
of
glance
and
curve,
to
delight,
thrill,
perhaps
more
hopelessly
to
enchain
me.
If
I
must
be
her
slave,
I
will
not
lose
my
freedom
for
nothing."
He
locked
the
desk,
pocketed
all
the
property,
and
went.
Everybody
said
it
was
high
time
for
Mr.
Moore
to
return
home.
All
Briarfield
wondered
at
his
strange
absence,
and
Whinbury
and
Nunnely
brought
each
its
separate
contribution
of
amazement.
Was
it
known
why
he
stayed
away?
Yes.
It
was
known
twenty
forty
times
over,
there
being
at
least
forty
plausible
reasons
adduced
to
account
for
the
unaccountable
circumstance.
Business
it
was
not
that
the
gossips
agreed.
He
had
achieved
the
business
on
which
he
departed
long
ago.
His
four
ringleaders
he
had
soon
scented
out
and
run
down.
He
had
attended
their
trial,
heard
their
conviction
and
sentence,
and
seen
them
safely
shipped
prior
to
transportation.
This
was
known
at
Briarfield.
The
newspapers
had
reported
it.
The
Stilbro'
Courier
had
given
every
particular,
with
amplifications.
None
applauded
his
perseverance
or
hailed
his
success,
though
the
mill
owners
were
glad
of
it,
trusting
that
the
terrors
of
law
vindicated
would
henceforward
paralyze
the
sinister
valour
of
disaffection.
Disaffection,
however,
was
still
heard
muttering
to
himself.
He
swore
ominous
oaths
over
the
drugged
beer
of
alehouses,
and
drank
strange
toasts
in
fiery
British
gin.
One
report
affirmed
