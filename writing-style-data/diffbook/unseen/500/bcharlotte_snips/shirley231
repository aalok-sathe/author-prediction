Her
heart
was
beating
fast
and
thick;
her
face
was
cold,
her
forehead
damp.
"Thank
God
for
us!"
she
reiterated.
"But
what
will
happen
elsewhere?
They
have
passed
us
by
that
they
may
make
sure
of
others."
"They
have
done
well,"
returned
Shirley,
with
composure.
"The
others
will
defend
themselves.
They
can
do
it.
They
are
prepared
for
them.
With
us
it
is
otherwise.
My
finger
was
on
the
trigger
of
this
pistol.
I
was
quite
ready
to
give
that
man,
if
he
had
entered,
such
a
greeting
as
he
little
calculated
on;
but
behind
him
followed
three
hundred.
I
had
neither
three
hundred
hands
nor
three
hundred
weapons.
I
could
not
have
effectually
protected
either
you,
myself,
or
the
two
poor
women
asleep
under
that
roof.
Therefore
I
again
earnestly
thank
God
for
insult
and
peril
escaped."
After
a
second
pause
she
continued:
"What
is
it
my
duty
and
wisdom
to
do
next?
Not
to
stay
here
inactive,
I
am
glad
to
say,
but,
of
course,
to
walk
over
to
the
Hollow."
"To
the
Hollow,
Shirley?"
"To
the
Hollow.
Will
you
go
with
me?"
"Where
those
men
are
gone?"
"They
have
taken
the
highway;
we
should
not
encounter
them.
The
road
over
the
fields
is
as
safe,
silent,
and
solitary
as
a
path
through
the
air
would
be.
Will
you
go?"
"Yes,"
was
the
answer,
given
mechanically,
not
because
the
speaker
wished
or
was
prepared
to
go,
or,
indeed,
was
otherwise
than
scared
at
the
prospect
of
going,
but
because
she
felt
she
could
not
abandon
Shirley.
"Then
we
must
fasten
up
these
windows,
and
leave
all
as
secure
as
we
can
behind
us.
Do
you
know
what
we
are
going
for,
Cary?"
"Yes
no
because
you
wish
it."
"Is
that
all?
And
are
you
so
obedient
to
a
mere
caprice
of
mine?
What
a
docile
wife
you
would
make
to
a
stern
husband!
The
moon's
face
is
not
whiter
than
yours
at
this
moment,
and
the
aspen
at
the
gate
does
not
tremble
more
than
your
busy
fingers;
and
so,
tractable
and
terror
struck,
and
dismayed
and
devoted,
you
would
follow
me
into
the
thick
of
real
danger!
Cary,
let
me
give
your
fidelity
a
motive.
We
are
going
for
Moore's
sake
to
see
if
we
can
be
of
use
to
him,
to
make
an
effort
to
warn
him
of
what
is
coming."
"To
be
sure!
I
am
a
blind,
weak
fool,
and
you
are
acute
and
sensible,
Shirley.
I
will
go
with
you;
I
will
gladly
go
with
you!"
"I
do
not
doubt
it.
You
would
die
blindly
and
meekly
for
me,
but
you
would
intelligently
and
gladly
die
for
Moore.
But,
in
truth,
there
is
no
question
of
death
to
night;
we
run
no
risk
at
all."
Caroline
rapidly
closed
shutter
and
lattice.
"Do
not
fear
that
I
shall
not
have
breath
to
run
as
fast
as
you
can
possibly
run,
Shirley.
Take
my
hand.
Let
us
go
straight
across
the
fields."
"But
you
cannot
climb
