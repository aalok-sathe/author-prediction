vague,
superfine
sensations,
and
extremely
wire
drawn
notions,
that
put
me
about.
Let
a
woman
ask
me
to
give
her
an
edible
or
a
wearable
be
the
same
a
roc's
egg
or
the
breastplate
of
Aaron,
a
share
of
St.
John's
locusts
and
honey
or
the
leathern
girdle
about
his
loins
I
can,
at
least,
understand
the
demand;
but
when
they
pine
for
they
know
not
what
sympathy,
sentiment,
some
of
these
indefinite
abstractions
I
can't
do
it;
I
don't
know
it;
I
haven't
got
it.
Madam,
accept
my
arm."
Mrs.
Pryor
signified
that
she
should
stay
with
her
daughter
that
evening.
Helstone,
accordingly,
left
them
together.
He
soon
returned,
bringing
a
plate
in
his
own
consecrated
hand.
"This
is
chicken,"
he
said,
"but
we'll
have
partridge
to
morrow.
Lift
her
up,
and
put
a
shawl
over
her.
On
my
word,
I
understand
nursing.
Now,
here
is
the
very
same
little
silver
fork
you
used
when
you
first
came
to
the
rectory.
That
strikes
me
as
being
what
you
may
call
a
happy
thought
a
delicate
attention.
Take
it,
Cary,
and
munch
away
cleverly."
Caroline
did
her
best.
Her
uncle
frowned
to
see
that
her
powers
were
so
limited.
He
prophesied,
however,
great
things
for
the
future;
and
as
she
praised
the
morsel
he
had
brought,
and
smiled
gratefully
in
his
face,
he
stooped
over
her
pillow,
kissed
her,
and
said,
with
a
broken,
rugged
accent,
"Good
night,
bairnie!
God
bless
thee!"
Caroline
enjoyed
such
peaceful
rest
that
night,
circled
by
her
mother's
arms,
and
pillowed
on
her
breast,
that
she
forgot
to
wish
for
any
other
stay;
and
though
more
than
one
feverish
dream
came
to
her
in
slumber,
yet,
when
she
woke
up
panting,
so
happy
and
contented
a
feeling
returned
with
returning
consciousness
that
her
agitation
was
soothed
almost
as
soon
as
felt.
As
to
the
mother,
she
spent
the
night
like
Jacob
at
Peniel.
Till
break
of
day
she
wrestled
with
God
in
earnest
prayer.
Not
always
do
those
who
dare
such
divine
conflict
prevail.
Night
after
night
the
sweat
of
agony
may
burst
dark
on
the
forehead;
the
supplicant
may
cry
for
mercy
with
that
soundless
voice
the
soul
utters
when
its
appeal
is
to
the
Invisible.
"Spare
my
beloved,"
it
may
implore.
"Heal
my
life's
life.
Rend
not
from
me
what
long
affection
entwines
with
my
whole
nature.
God
of
heaven,
bend,
hear,
be
clement!"
And
after
this
cry
and
strife
the
sun
may
rise
and
see
him
worsted.
That
opening
morn,
which
used
to
salute
him
with
the
whisper
of
zephyrs,
the
carol
of
skylarks,
may
breathe,
as
its
first
accents,
from
the
dear
lips
which
colour
and
heat
have
quitted,
"Oh!
I
have
had
a
suffering
night.
This
morning
I
am
worse.
I
have
tried
to
rise.
I
cannot.
Dreams
I
am
unused
to
have
troubled
me."
Then
the
watcher
approaches
the
patient's
pillow,
and
sees
a
new
and
strange
moulding
of
the
familiar
features,
feels
at
once
that
the
insufferable
moment
