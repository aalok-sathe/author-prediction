the
news
of
what
had
happened
at
the
Hollow
was
spread
all
over
the
neighbourhood.
Fanny,
who
had
been
to
Fieldhead
to
fetch
the
milk,
returned
in
panting
haste
with
tidings
that
there
had
been
a
battle
in
the
night
at
Mr.
Moore's
mill,
and
that
some
said
twenty
men
were
killed.
Eliza,
during
Fanny's
absence,
had
been
apprised
by
the
butcher's
boy
that
the
mill
was
burnt
to
the
ground.
Both
women
rushed
into
the
parlour
to
announce
these
terrible
facts
to
the
ladies,
terminating
their
clear
and
accurate
narrative
by
the
assertion
that
they
were
sure
master
must
have
been
in
it
all.
He
and
Thomas,
the
clerk,
they
were
confident,
must
have
gone
last
night
to
join
Mr.
Moore
and
the
soldiers.
Mr.
Malone,
too,
had
not
been
heard
of
at
his
lodgings
since
yesterday
afternoon;
and
Joe
Scott's
wife
and
family
were
in
the
greatest
distress,
wondering
what
had
become
of
their
head.
Scarcely
was
this
information
imparted
when
a
knock
at
the
kitchen
door
announced
the
Fieldhead
errand
boy,
arrived
in
hot
haste,
bearing
a
billet
from
Mrs.
Pryor.
It
was
hurriedly
written,
and
urged
Miss
Keeldar
to
return
directly,
as
the
neighbourhood
and
the
house
seemed
likely
to
be
all
in
confusion,
and
orders
would
have
to
be
given
which
the
mistress
of
the
hall
alone
could
regulate.
In
a
postscript
it
was
entreated
that
Miss
Helstone
might
not
be
left
alone
at
the
rectory.
She
had
better,
it
was
suggested,
accompany
Miss
Keeldar.
"There
are
not
two
opinions
on
that
head,"
said
Shirley,
as
she
tied
on
her
own
bonnet,
and
then
ran
to
fetch
Caroline's.
"But
what
will
Fanny
and
Eliza
do?
And
if
my
uncle
returns?"
"Your
uncle
will
not
return
yet;
he
has
other
fish
to
fry.
He
will
be
galloping
backwards
and
forwards
from
Briarfield
to
Stilbro'
all
day,
rousing
the
magistrates
in
the
court
house
and
the
officers
at
the
barracks;
and
Fanny
and
Eliza
can
have
in
Joe
Scott's
and
the
clerk's
wives
to
bear
them
company.
Besides,
of
course,
there
is
no
real
danger
to
be
apprehended
now.
Weeks
will
elapse
before
the
rioters
can
again
rally,
or
plan
any
other
attempt;
and
I
am
much
mistaken
if
Moore
and
Mr.
Helstone
will
not
take
advantage
of
last
night's
outbreak
to
quell
them
altogether.
They
will
frighten
the
authorities
of
Stilbro'
into
energetic
measures.
I
only
hope
they
will
not
be
too
severe
not
pursue
the
discomfited
too
relentlessly."
"Robert
will
not
be
cruel.
We
saw
that
last
night,"
said
Caroline.
"But
he
will
be
hard,"
retorted
Shirley;
"and
so
will
your
uncle."
As
they
hurried
along
the
meadow
and
plantation
path
to
Fieldhead,
they
saw
the
distant
highway
already
alive
with
an
unwonted
flow
of
equestrians
and
pedestrians,
tending
in
the
direction
of
the
usually
solitary
Hollow.
On
reaching
the
hall,
they
found
the
backyard
gates
open,
and
the
court
and
kitchen
seemed
crowded
with
excited
milk
fetchers
men,
women,
and
children
whom
