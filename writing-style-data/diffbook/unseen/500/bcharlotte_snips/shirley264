by
John,
must
permit
herself
the
treat
of
feeding
them
with
her
own
hand,
under
the
direction
of
her
careful
foreman.
Meantime
John
moots
doubtful
questions
about
the
farming
of
certain
"crofts,"
and
"ings,"
and
"holmes,"
and
his
mistress
is
necessitated
to
fetch
her
garden
hat
a
gipsy
straw
and
accompany
him,
over
stile
and
along
hedgerow,
to
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
agricultural
matter
on
the
spot,
and
with
the
said
"crofts,"
"ings,"
and
"holms"
under
her
eye.
Bright
afternoon
thus
wears
into
soft
evening,
and
she
comes
home
to
a
late
tea,
and
after
tea
she
never
sews.
After
tea
Shirley
reads,
and
she
is
just
about
as
tenacious
of
her
book
as
she
is
lax
of
her
needle.
Her
study
is
the
rug,
her
seat
a
footstool,
or
perhaps
only
the
carpet
at
Mrs.
Pryor's
feet:
there
she
always
learned
her
lessons
when
a
child,
and
old
habits
have
a
strong
power
over
her.
The
tawny
and
lionlike
bulk
of
Tartar
is
ever
stretched
beside
her,
his
negro
muzzle
laid
on
his
fore
paws
straight,
strong,
and
shapely
as
the
limbs
of
an
Alpine
wolf.
One
hand
of
the
mistress
generally
reposes
on
the
loving
serf's
rude
head,
because
if
she
takes
it
away
he
groans
and
is
discontented.
Shirley's
mind
is
given
to
her
book.
She
lifts
not
her
eyes;
she
neither
stirs
nor
speaks
unless,
indeed,
it
be
to
return
a
brief
respectful
answer
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
addresses
deprecatory
phrases
to
her
now
and
then.
"My
dear,
you
had
better
not
have
that
great
dog
so
near
you;
he
is
crushing
the
border
of
your
dress."
"Oh,
it
is
only
muslin.
I
can
put
a
clean
one
on
to
morrow."
"My
dear,
I
wish
you
could
acquire
the
habit
of
sitting
to
a
table
when
you
read."
"I
will
try,
ma'am,
some
time;
but
it
is
so
comfortable
to
do
as
one
has
always
been
accustomed
to
do."
"My
dear,
let
me
beg
of
you
to
put
that
book
down.
You
are
trying
your
eyes
by
the
doubtful
firelight."
"No,
ma'am,
not
at
all;
my
eyes
are
never
tired."
At
last,
however,
a
pale
light
falls
on
the
page
from
the
window.
She
looks;
the
moon
is
up.
She
closes
the
volume,
rises,
and
walks
through
the
room.
Her
book
has
perhaps
been
a
good
one;
it
has
refreshed,
refilled,
rewarmed
her
heart;
it
has
set
her
brain
astir,
furnished
her
mind
with
pictures.
The
still
parlour,
the
clean
hearth,
the
window
opening
on
the
twilight
sky,
and
showing
its
"sweet
regent,"
new
throned
and
glorious,
suffice
to
make
earth
an
Eden,
life
a
poem,
for
Shirley.
A
still,
deep,
inborn
delight
glows
in
her
young
veins,
unmingled,
untroubled,
not
to
be
reached
or
ravished
by
human
agency,
because
by
no
human
agency
bestowed
the
pure
gift
of
God
to
His
creature,
the
free
dower
of
Nature
to
her
child.
This
joy
gives
her
experience
of
a
genii
life.
Buoyant,
by
green
steps,
