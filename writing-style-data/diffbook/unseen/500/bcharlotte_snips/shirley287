summoned,
sneered
at
the
hypochondriac
fancies
of
the
rich
and
idle,
who,
she
said,
having
nothing
but
themselves
to
think
about,
must
needs
send
for
a
doctor
if
only
so
much
as
their
little
finger
ached.
The
"rich
and
idle,"
represented
in
the
person
of
Caroline,
were
meantime
falling
fast
into
a
condition
of
prostration,
whose
quickly
consummated
debility
puzzled
all
who
witnessed
it
except
one;
for
that
one
alone
reflected
how
liable
is
the
undermined
structure
to
sink
in
sudden
ruin.
Sick
people
often
have
fancies
inscrutable
to
ordinary
attendants,
and
Caroline
had
one
which
even
her
tender
nurse
could
not
at
first
explain.
On
a
certain
day
in
the
week,
at
a
certain
hour,
she
would
whether
worse
or
better
entreat
to
be
taken
up
and
dressed,
and
suffered
to
sit
in
her
chair
near
the
window.
This
station
she
would
retain
till
noon
was
past.
Whatever
degree
of
exhaustion
or
debility
her
wan
aspect
betrayed,
she
still
softly
put
off
all
persuasion
to
seek
repose
until
the
church
clock
had
duly
tolled
midday.
The
twelve
strokes
sounded,
she
grew
docile,
and
would
meekly
lie
down.
Returned
to
the
couch,
she
usually
buried
her
face
deep
in
the
pillow,
and
drew
the
coverlets
close
round
her,
as
if
to
shut
out
the
world
and
sun,
of
which
she
was
tired.
More
than
once,
as
she
thus
lay,
a
slight
convulsion
shook
the
sick
bed,
and
a
faint
sob
broke
the
silence
round
it.
These
things
were
not
unnoted
by
Mrs.
Pryor.
One
Tuesday
morning,
as
usual,
she
had
asked
leave
to
rise,
and
now
she
sat
wrapped
in
her
white
dressing
gown,
leaning
forward
in
the
easy
chair,
gazing
steadily
and
patiently
from
the
lattice.
Mrs.
Pryor
was
seated
a
little
behind,
knitting
as
it
seemed,
but,
in
truth,
watching
her.
A
change
crossed
her
pale,
mournful
brow,
animating
its
languor;
a
light
shot
into
her
faded
eyes,
reviving
their
lustre;
she
half
rose
and
looked
earnestly
out.
Mrs.
Pryor,
drawing
softly
near,
glanced
over
her
shoulder.
From
this
window
was
visible
the
churchyard,
beyond
it
the
road;
and
there,
riding
sharply
by,
appeared
a
horseman.
The
figure
was
not
yet
too
remote
for
recognition.
Mrs.
Pryor
had
long
sight;
she
knew
Mr.
Moore.
Just
as
an
intercepting
rising
ground
concealed
him
from
view,
the
clock
struck
twelve.
"May
I
lie
down
again?"
asked
Caroline.
Her
nurse
assisted
her
to
bed.
Having
laid
her
down
and
drawn
the
curtain,
she
stood
listening
near.
The
little
couch
trembled,
the
suppressed
sob
stirred
the
air.
A
contraction
as
of
anguish
altered
Mrs.
Pryor's
features;
she
wrung
her
hands;
half
a
groan
escaped
her
lips.
She
now
remembered
that
Tuesday
was
Whinbury
market
day.
Mr.
Moore
must
always
pass
the
rectory
on
his
way
thither,
just
ere
noon
of
that
day.
Caroline
wore
continually
round
her
neck
a
slender
braid
of
silk,
attached
to
which
was
some
trinket.
Mrs.
Pryor
had
seen
the
bit
of
gold
glisten,
but
had
not
yet
