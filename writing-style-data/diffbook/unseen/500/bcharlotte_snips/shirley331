fell
loose
again.
"Certainly
I
was
a
rebel,"
she
answered.
"A
rebel!"
repeated
Henry.
"Yes;
you
and
papa
had
quarrelled
terribly,
and
you
set
both
him
and
mamma,
and
Mrs.
Pryor,
and
everybody,
at
defiance.
You
said
he
had
insulted
you
"
"He
had
insulted
me,"
interposed
Shirley.
"And
you
wanted
to
leave
Sympson
Grove
directly.
You
packed
your
things
up,
and
papa
threw
them
out
of
your
trunk;
mamma
cried,
Mrs.
Pryor
cried;
they
both
stood
wringing
their
hands
begging
you
to
be
patient;
and
you
knelt
on
the
floor
with
your
things
and
your
up
turned
box
before
you,
looking,
Shirley,
looking
why,
in
one
of
your
passions.
Your
features,
in
such
passions,
are
not
distorted;
they
are
fixed,
but
quite
beautiful.
You
scarcely
look
angry,
only
resolute,
and
in
a
certain
haste;
yet
one
feels
that
at
such
times
an
obstacle
cast
across
your
path
would
be
split
as
with
lightning.
Papa
lost
heart,
and
called
Mr.
Moore."
"Enough,
Henry."
"No,
it
is
not
enough.
I
hardly
know
how
Mr.
Moore
managed,
except
that
I
recollect
he
suggested
to
papa
that
agitation
would
bring
on
his
gout;
and
then
he
spoke
quietly
to
the
ladies,
and
got
them
away;
and
afterwards
he
said
to
you,
Miss
Shirley,
that
it
was
of
no
use
talking
or
lecturing
now,
but
that
the
tea
things
were
just
brought
into
the
schoolroom,
and
he
was
very
thirsty,
and
he
would
be
glad
if
you
would
leave
your
packing
for
the
present
and
come
and
make
a
cup
of
tea
for
him
and
me.
You
came;
you
would
not
talk
at
first,
but
soon
you
softened
and
grew
cheerful.
Mr.
Moore
began
to
tell
us
about
the
Continent,
the
war,
and
Bonaparte
subjects
we
were
both
fond
of
listening
to.
After
tea
he
said
we
should
neither
of
us
leave
him
that
evening;
he
would
not
let
us
stray
out
of
his
sight,
lest
we
should
again
get
into
mischief.
We
sat
one
on
each
side
of
him.
We
were
so
happy.
I
never
passed
so
pleasant
an
evening.
The
next
day
he
gave
you,
missy,
a
lecture
of
an
hour,
and
wound
it
up
by
marking
you
a
piece
to
learn
in
Bossuet
as
a
punishment
lesson
'Le
Cheval
Dompte.'
You
learned
it
instead
of
packing
up,
Shirley.
We
heard
no
more
of
your
running
away.
Mr.
Moore
used
to
tease
you
on
the
subject
for
a
year
afterwards."
"She
never
said
a
lesson
with
greater
spirit,"
subjoined
Moore.
"She
then,
for
the
first
time,
gave
me
the
treat
of
hearing
my
native
tongue
spoken
without
accent
by
an
English
girl."
"She
was
as
sweet
as
summer
cherries
for
a
month
afterwards,"
struck
in
Henry:
"a
good
hearty
quarrel
always
left
Shirley's
temper
better
than
it
found
it."
"You
talk
of
me
as
if
I
were
not
present,"
observed
Miss
Keeldar,
who
had
not
yet
lifted
her
face.
"Are
you
sure
you
are
present?"
asked
Moore.
"There
have
been
moments
since
