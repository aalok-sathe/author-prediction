die,
and
you
will
have
learned
the
great
lesson
how
to
endure
without
a
sob.
For
the
whole
remnant
of
your
life,
if
you
survive
the
test
some,
it
is
said,
die
under
it
you
will
be
stronger,
wiser,
less
sensitive.
This
you
are
not
aware
of,
perhaps,
at
the
time,
and
so
cannot
borrow
courage
of
that
hope.
Nature,
however,
as
has
been
intimated,
is
an
excellent
friend
in
such
cases,
sealing
the
lips,
interdicting
utterance,
commanding
a
placid
dissimulation
a
dissimulation
often
wearing
an
easy
and
gay
mien
at
first,
settling
down
to
sorrow
and
paleness
in
time,
then
passing
away,
and
leaving
a
convenient
stoicism,
not
the
less
fortifying
because
it
is
half
bitter.
Half
bitter!
Is
that
wrong?
No;
it
should
be
bitter:
bitterness
is
strength
it
is
a
tonic.
Sweet,
mild
force
following
acute
suffering
you
find
nowhere;
to
talk
of
it
is
delusion.
There
may
be
apathetic
exhaustion
after
the
rack.
If
energy
remains,
it
will
be
rather
a
dangerous
energy
deadly
when
confronted
with
injustice.
Who
has
read
the
ballad
of
"Puir
Mary
Lee"
that
old
Scotch
ballad,
written
I
know
not
in
what
generation
nor
by
what
hand?
Mary
had
been
ill
used
probably
in
being
made
to
believe
that
truth
which
was
falsehood.
She
is
not
complaining,
but
she
is
sitting
alone
in
the
snowstorm,
and
you
hear
her
thoughts.
They
are
not
the
thoughts
of
a
model
heroine
under
her
circumstances,
but
they
are
those
of
a
deeply
feeling,
strongly
resentful
peasant
girl.
Anguish
has
driven
her
from
the
ingle
nook
of
home
to
the
white
shrouded
and
icy
hills.
Crouched
under
the
"cauld
drift,"
she
recalls
every
image
of
horror
"the
yellow
wymed
ask,"
"the
hairy
adder,"
"the
auld
moon
bowing
tyke,"
"the
ghaist
at
e'en,",
"the
sour
bullister,"
"the
milk
on
the
taed's
back."
She
hates
these,
but
"waur
she
hates
Robin
a
Ree."
"Oh,
ance
I
lived
happily
by
yon
bonny
burn
The
warld
was
in
love
wi'
me;
But
now
I
maun
sit
'neath
the
cauld
drift
and
mourn,
And
curse
black
Robin
a
Ree!
"Then
whudder
awa,
thou
bitter
biting
blast,
And
sough
through
the
scrunty
tree,
And
smoor
me
up
in
the
snaw
fu'
fast,
And
n'er
let
the
sun
me
see!
"Oh,
never
melt
awa,
thou
wreath
o'
snaw,
That's
sae
kind
in
graving
me;
But
hide
me
frae
the
scorn
and
guffaw
O'
villains
like
Robin
a
Ree!"
But
what
has
been
said
in
the
last
page
or
two
is
not
germane
to
Caroline
Helstone's
feelings,
or
to
the
state
of
things
between
her
and
Robert
Moore.
Robert
had
done
her
no
wrong;
he
had
told
her
no
lie;
it
was
she
that
was
to
blame,
if
any
one
was.
What
bitterness
her
mind
distilled
should
and
would
be
poured
on
her
own
head.
She
had
loved
without
being
asked
to
love
a
natural,
sometimes
an
inevitable
chance,
but
big
with
misery.
Robert,
indeed,
had
sometimes
seemed
to
be
fond
of
her;
