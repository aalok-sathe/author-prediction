his
feelings
by
a
little
flowery
language,
with
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
strew
the
present
page.
A
bouquet
or
two
of
the
choicest
blossoms
fell
on
the
unperturbed
head
of
one
Mr.
Graves,
a
stony
young
assistant
he
usually
carried
about
with
him;
with
a
second
nosegay
he
gifted
another
young
gentleman
in
his
train
an
interesting
fac
simile
of
himself,
being
indeed
his
own
son;
but
the
full
corbeille
of
blushing
bloom
fell
to
the
lot
of
meddling
womankind,
en
masse.
For
the
best
part
of
one
winter
night
himself
and
satellites
were
busied
about
Moore.
There
at
his
bedside,
shut
up
alone
with
him
in
his
chamber,
they
wrought
and
wrangled
over
his
exhausted
frame.
They
three
were
on
one
side
of
the
bed,
and
Death
on
the
other.
The
conflict
was
sharp;
it
lasted
till
day
broke,
when
the
balance
between
the
belligerents
seemed
so
equal
that
both
parties
might
have
claimed
the
victory.
At
dawn
Graves
and
young
MacTurk
were
left
in
charge
of
the
patient,
while
the
senior
went
himself
in
search
of
additional
strength,
and
secured
it
in
the
person
of
Mrs.
Horsfall,
the
best
nurse
on
his
staff.
To
this
woman
he
gave
Moore
in
charge,
with
the
sternest
injunctions
respecting
the
responsibility
laid
on
her
shoulders.
She
took
this
responsibility
stolidly,
as
she
did
also
the
easy
chair
at
the
bedhead.
That
moment
she
began
her
reign.
Mrs.
Horsfall
had
one
virtue
orders
received
from
MacTurk
she
obeyed
to
the
letter.
The
ten
commandments
were
less
binding
in
her
eyes
than
her
surgeon's
dictum.
In
other
respects
she
was
no
woman,
but
a
dragon.
Hortense
Moore
fell
effaced
before
her;
Mrs.
Yorke
withdrew
crushed;
yet
both
these
women
were
personages
of
some
dignity
in
their
own
estimation,
and
of
some
bulk
in
the
estimation
of
others.
Perfectly
cowed
by
the
breadth,
the
height,
the
bone,
and
the
brawn
of
Mrs.
Horsfall,
they
retreated
to
the
back
parlour.
She,
for
her
part,
sat
upstairs
when
she
liked,
and
downstairs
when
she
preferred
it.
She
took
her
dram
three
times
a
day,
and
her
pipe
of
tobacco
four
times.
As
to
Moore,
no
one
now
ventured
to
inquire
about
him.
Mrs.
Horsfall
had
him
at
dry
nurse.
It
was
she
who
was
to
do
for
him,
and
the
general
conjecture
now
ran
that
she
did
for
him
accordingly.
Morning
and
evening
MacTurk
came
to
see
him.
His
case,
thus
complicated
by
a
new
mischance,
was
become
one
of
interest
in
the
surgeon's
eyes.
He
regarded
him
as
a
damaged
piece
of
clockwork,
which
it
would
be
creditable
to
his
skill
to
set
agoing
again.
Graves
and
young
MacTurk
Moore's
sole
other
visitors
contemplated
him
in
the
light
in
which
they
were
wont
to
contemplate
the
occupant
for
the
time
being
of
the
dissecting
room
at
Stilbro'
Infirmary.
Robert
Moore
had
a
pleasant
time
of
it
in
pain,
in
danger,
too
weak
to
move,
almost
too
weak
to
speak,
a
sort
of
giantess
