the
gentlemen
into
the
most
charming
mood
imaginable.
She
herself
had
taken
in
hand
Dr.
Boultby
and
Mr.
Helstone.
The
first
was
a
stubborn
old
Welshman,
hot,
opinionated,
and
obstinate,
but
withal
a
man
who
did
a
great
deal
of
good,
though
not
without
making
some
noise
about
it.
The
latter
we
know.
She
had
rather
a
friendly
feeling
for
both,
especially
for
old
Helstone;
and
it
cost
her
no
trouble
to
be
quite
delightful
to
them.
She
took
them
round
the
garden;
she
gathered
them
flowers;
she
was
like
a
kind
daughter
to
them.
Mr.
Hall
she
left
to
Caroline
or
rather,
it
was
to
Caroline's
care
Mr.
Hall
consigned
himself.
He
generally
sought
Caroline
in
every
party
where
she
and
he
happened
to
be.
He
was
not
in
general
a
lady's
man,
though
all
ladies
liked
him;
something
of
a
book
worm
he
was,
near
sighted,
spectacled,
now
and
then
abstracted.
To
old
ladies
he
was
kind
as
a
son.
To
men
of
every
occupation
and
grade
he
was
acceptable.
The
truth,
simplicity,
frankness
of
his
manners,
the
nobleness
of
his
integrity,
the
reality
and
elevation
of
his
piety,
won
him
friends
in
every
grade.
His
poor
clerk
and
sexton
delighted
in
him;
the
noble
patron
of
his
living
esteemed
him
highly.
It
was
only
with
young,
handsome,
fashionable,
and
stylish
ladies
he
felt
a
little
shy.
Being
himself
a
plain
man
plain
in
aspect,
plain
in
manners,
plain
in
speech
he
seemed
to
fear
their
dash,
elegance,
and
airs.
But
Miss
Helstone
had
neither
dash
nor
airs,
and
her
native
elegance
was
of
a
very
quiet
order
quiet
as
the
beauty
of
a
ground
loving
hedge
flower.
He
was
a
fluent,
cheerful,
agreeable
talker.
Caroline
could
talk
too
in
a
tete
a
tete.
She
liked
Mr.
Hall
to
come
and
take
the
seat
next
her
in
a
party,
and
thus
secure
her
from
Peter
Augustus
Malone,
Joseph
Donne,
or
John
Sykes;
and
Mr.
Hall
never
failed
to
avail
himself
of
this
privilege
when
he
possibly
could.
Such
preference
shown
by
a
single
gentleman
to
a
single
lady
would
certainly,
in
ordinary
cases,
have
set
in
motion
the
tongues
of
the
gossips;
but
Cyril
Hall
was
forty
five
years
old,
slightly
bald,
and
slightly
gray,
and
nobody
ever
said
or
thought
he
was
likely
to
be
married
to
Miss
Helstone.
Nor
did
he
think
so
himself.
He
was
wedded
already
to
his
books
and
his
parish.
His
kind
sister
Margaret,
spectacled
and
learned
like
himself,
made
him
happy
in
his
single
state;
he
considered
it
too
late
to
change.
Besides,
he
had
known
Caroline
as
a
pretty
little
girl.
She
had
sat
on
his
knee
many
a
time;
he
had
bought
her
toys
and
given
her
books;
he
felt
that
her
friendship
for
him
was
mixed
with
a
sort
of
filial
respect;
he
could
not
have
brought
himself
to
attempt
to
give
another
colour
to
her
sentiments,
and
his
serene
mind
could
glass
a
fair
image
without
feeling
