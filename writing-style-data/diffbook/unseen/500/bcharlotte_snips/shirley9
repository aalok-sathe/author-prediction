right
mind,
do
you
think,
sir?"
inquired
Sweeting
simply.
"Can't
tell,
Davy.
He
may
be
crazed,
or
he
may
be
only
crafty,
or
perhaps
a
little
of
both."
"He
talks
of
seeing
visions,
sir."
"Ay!
He
is
a
very
Ezekiel
or
Daniel
for
visions.
He
came
just
when
I
was
going
to
bed
last
Friday
night
to
describe
one
that
had
been
revealed
to
him
in
Nunnely
Park
that
very
afternoon."
"Tell
it,
sir.
What
was
it?"
urged
Sweeting.
"Davy,
thou
hast
an
enormous
organ
of
wonder
in
thy
cranium.
Malone,
you
see,
has
none.
Neither
murders
nor
visions
interest
him.
See
what
a
big
vacant
Saph
he
looks
at
this
moment."
"Saph!
Who
was
Saph,
sir?"
"I
thought
you
would
not
know.
You
may
find
it
out.
It
is
biblical.
I
know
nothing
more
of
him
than
his
name
and
race;
but
from
a
boy
upwards
I
have
always
attached
a
personality
to
Saph.
Depend
on
it
he
was
honest,
heavy,
and
luckless.
He
met
his
end
at
Gob
by
the
hand
of
Sibbechai."
"But
the
vision,
sir?"
"Davy,
thou
shalt
hear.
Donne
is
biting
his
nails,
and
Malone
yawning,
so
I
will
tell
it
but
to
thee.
Mike
is
out
of
work,
like
many
others,
unfortunately.
Mr.
Grame,
Sir
Philip
Nunnely's
steward,
gave
him
a
job
about
the
priory.
According
to
his
account,
Mike
was
busy
hedging
rather
late
in
the
afternoon,
but
before
dark,
when
he
heard
what
he
thought
was
a
band
at
a
distance
bugles,
fifes,
and
the
sound
of
a
trumpet;
it
came
from
the
forest,
and
he
wondered
that
there
should
be
music
there.
He
looked
up.
All
amongst
the
trees
he
saw
moving
objects,
red,
like
poppies,
or
white,
like
may
blossom.
The
wood
was
full
of
them;
they
poured
out
and
filled
the
park.
He
then
perceived
they
were
soldiers
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands;
but
they
made
no
more
noise
than
a
swarm
of
midges
on
a
summer
evening.
They
formed
in
order,
he
affirmed,
and
marched,
regiment
after
regiment,
across
the
park.
He
followed
them
to
Nunnely
Common;
the
music
still
played
soft
and
distant.
On
the
common
he
watched
them
go
through
a
number
of
evolutions.
A
man
clothed
in
scarlet
stood
in
the
centre
and
directed
them.
They
extended,
he
declared,
over
fifty
acres.
They
were
in
sight
half
an
hour;
then
they
marched
away
quite
silently.
The
whole
time
he
heard
neither
voice
nor
tread
nothing
but
the
faint
music
playing
a
solemn
march."
"Where
did
they
go,
sir?"
"Towards
Briarfield.
Mike
followed
them.
They
seemed
passing
Fieldhead,
when
a
column
of
smoke,
such
as
might
be
vomited
by
a
park
of
artillery,
spread
noiseless
over
the
fields,
the
road,
the
common,
and
rolled,
he
said,
blue
and
dim,
to
his
very
feet.
As
it
cleared
away
he
looked
again
for
the
soldiers,
but
they
were
vanished;
he
saw
them
no
more.
Mike,
like
a
wise
Daniel
as
he
is,
not
only
rehearsed
the
vision
but
