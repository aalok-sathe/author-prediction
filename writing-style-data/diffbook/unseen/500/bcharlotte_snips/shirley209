score
supplying
hot
water,
brought
from
the
coppers
of
the
rector's
kitchen.
The
profusion
of
flowers
and
evergreens
decorating
the
white
walls,
the
show
of
silver
teapots
and
bright
porcelain
on
the
tables,
the
active
figures,
blithe
faces,
gay
dresses
flitting
about
everywhere,
formed
altogether
a
refreshing
and
lively
spectacle.
Everybody
talked,
not
very
loudly,
but
merrily,
and
the
canary
birds
sang
shrill
in
their
high
hung
cages.
Caroline,
as
the
rector's
niece,
took
her
place
at
one
of
the
three
first
tables;
Mrs.
Boultby
and
Margaret
Hall
officiated
at
the
others.
At
these
tables
the
elite
of
the
company
were
to
be
entertained,
strict
rules
of
equality
not
being
more
in
fashion
at
Briarfield
than
elsewhere.
Miss
Helstone
removed
her
bonnet
and
scarf,
that
she
might
be
less
oppressed
with
the
heat.
Her
long
curls,
falling
on
her
neck,
served
almost
in
place
of
a
veil;
and
for
the
rest,
her
muslin
dress
was
fashioned
modestly
as
a
nun's
robe,
enabling
her
thus
to
dispense
with
the
encumbrance
of
a
shawl.
The
room
was
filling.
Mr.
Hall
had
taken
his
post
beside
Caroline,
who
now,
as
she
rearranged
the
cups
and
spoons
before
her,
whispered
to
him
in
a
low
voice
remarks
on
the
events
of
the
day.
He
looked
a
little
grave
about
what
had
taken
place
in
Royd
Lane,
and
she
tried
to
smile
him
out
of
his
seriousness.
Miss
Keeldar
sat
near
for
a
wonder,
neither
laughing
nor
talking;
on
the
contrary,
very
still,
and
gazing
round
her
vigilantly.
She
seemed
afraid
lest
some
intruder
should
take
a
seat
she
apparently
wished
to
reserve
next
her
own.
Ever
and
anon
she
spread
her
satin
dress
over
an
undue
portion
of
the
bench,
or
laid
her
gloves
or
her
embroidered
handkerchief
upon
it.
Caroline
noticed
this
manege
at
last,
and
asked
her
what
friend
she
expected.
Shirley
bent
towards
her,
almost
touched
her
ear
with
her
rosy
lips,
and
whispered
with
a
musical
softness
that
often
characterized
her
tones
when
what
she
said
tended
even
remotely
to
stir
some
sweet
secret
source
of
feeling
in
her
heart,
"I
expect
Mr.
Moore.
I
saw
him
last
night,
and
I
made
him
promise
to
come
with
his
sister,
and
to
sit
at
our
table.
He
won't
fail
me,
I
feel
certain;
but
I
apprehend
his
coming
too
late,
and
being
separated
from
us.
Here
is
a
fresh
batch
arriving;
every
place
will
be
taken.
Provoking!"
In
fact,
Mr.
Wynne
the
magistrate,
his
wife,
his
son,
and
his
two
daughters
now
entered
in
high
state.
They
were
Briarfield
gentry.
Of
course
their
place
was
at
the
first
table,
and
being
conducted
thither,
they
filled
up
the
whole
remaining
space.
For
Miss
Keeldar's
comfort,
Mr.
Sam
Wynne
inducted
himself
into
the
very
vacancy
she
had
kept
for
Moore,
planting
himself
solidly
on
her
gown,
her
gloves,
and
her
handkerchief.
Mr.
Sam
was
one
of
the
objects
of
her
aversion,
and
the
more
so
because
he
showed
serious
symptoms
of
an
aim
