enduring
to
be
mated
with
a
lamb;
I
should
find
more
congenial
responsibility
in
the
charge
of
a
young
lioness
or
leopardess.
I
like
few
things
sweet
but
what
are
likewise
pungent
few
things
bright
but
what
are
likewise
hot.
I
like
the
summer
day,
whose
sun
makes
fruit
blush
and
corn
blanch.
Beauty
is
never
so
beautiful
as
when,
if
I
tease
it,
it
wreathes
back
on
me
with
spirit.
Fascination
is
never
so
imperial
as
when,
roused
and
half
ireful,
she
threatens
transformation
to
fierceness.
I
fear
I
should
tire
of
the
mute,
monotonous
innocence
of
the
lamb;
I
should
ere
long
feel
as
burdensome
the
nestling
dove
which
never
stirred
in
my
bosom;
but
my
patience
would
exult
in
stilling
the
flutterings
and
training
the
energies
of
the
restless
merlin.
In
managing
the
wild
instincts
of
the
scarce
manageable
bete
fauve
my
powers
would
revel.
"O
my
pupil!
O
Peri!
too
mutinous
for
heaven,
too
innocent
for
hell,
never
shall
I
do
more
than
see,
and
worship,
and
wish
for
thee.
Alas!
knowing
I
could
make
thee
happy,
will
it
be
my
doom
to
see
thee
possessed
by
those
who
have
not
that
power?
"However
kindly
the
hand,
if
it
is
feeble,
it
cannot
bend
Shirley;
and
she
must
be
bent.
It
cannot
curb
her;
and
she
must
be
curbed.
"Beware,
Sir
Philip
Nunnely!
I
never
see
you
walking
or
sitting
at
her
side,
and
observe
her
lips
compressed,
or
her
brow
knit,
in
resolute
endurance
of
some
trait
of
your
character
which
she
neither
admires
nor
likes,
in
determined
toleration
of
some
weakness
she
believes
atoned
for
by
a
virtue,
but
which
annoys
her
despite
that
belief;
I
never
mark
the
grave
glow
of
her
face,
the
unsmiling
sparkle
of
her
eye,
the
slight
recoil
of
her
whole
frame
when
you
draw
a
little
too
near,
and
gaze
a
little
too
expressively,
and
whisper
a
little
too
warmly
I
never
witness
these
things
but
I
think
of
the
fable
of
Semele
reversed.
"It
is
not
the
daughter
of
Cadmus
I
see,
nor
do
I
realize
her
fatal
longing
to
look
on
Jove
in
the
majesty
of
his
god
head.
It
is
a
priest
of
Juno
that
stands
before
me,
watching
late
and
lone
at
a
shrine
in
an
Argive
temple.
For
years
of
solitary
ministry
he
has
lived
on
dreams.
There
is
divine
madness
upon
him.
He
loves
the
idol
he
serves,
and
prays
day
and
night
that
his
frenzy
may
be
fed,
and
that
the
Ox
eyed
may
smile
on
her
votary.
She
has
heard;
she
will
be
propitious.
All
Argos
slumbers.
The
doors
of
the
temple
are
shut;
the
priest
waits
at
the
altar.
"A
shock
of
heaven
and
earth
is
felt
not
by
the
slumbering
city,
only
by
that
lonely
watcher,
brave
and
unshaken
in
his
fanaticism.
In
the
midst
of
silence,
with
no
preluding
sound,
he
is
wrapped
in
sudden
light.
Through
the
roof,
through
the
rent,
wide
yawning,
vast,
white
