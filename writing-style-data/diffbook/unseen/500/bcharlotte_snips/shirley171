have
seen
it
if
he
would;
whether
he
did
see
it,
nothing
indicated.
"Good
night!"
she
said,
shaking
like
a
leaf,
offering
her
thin
hand
hastily,
anxious
to
part
from
him
quickly.
"You
are
going
home?"
he
asked,
not
touching
her
hand.
"Yes."
"Is
Fanny
come
for
you?"
"Yes."
"I
may
as
well
accompany
you
a
step
of
the
way;
not
up
to
the
rectory,
though,
lest
my
old
friend
Helstone
should
shoot
me
from
the
window."
He
laughed,
and
took
his
hat.
Caroline
spoke
of
unnecessary
trouble;
he
told
her
to
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl.
She
was
quickly
ready,
and
they
were
soon
both
in
the
open
air.
Moore
drew
her
hand
under
his
arm,
just
in
his
old
manner
that
manner
which
she
ever
felt
to
be
so
kind.
"You
may
run
on,
Fanny,"
he
said
to
the
housemaid;
"we
shall
overtake
you."
And
when
the
girl
had
got
a
little
in
advance,
he
enclosed
Caroline's
hand
in
his,
and
said
he
was
glad
to
find
she
was
a
familiar
guest
at
Fieldhead.
He
hoped
her
intimacy
with
Miss
Keeldar
would
continue;
such
society
would
be
both
pleasant
and
improving.
Caroline
replied
that
she
liked
Shirley.
"And
there
is
no
doubt
the
liking
is
mutual,"
said
Moore.
"If
she
professes
friendship,
be
certain
she
is
sincere.
She
cannot
feign;
she
scorns
hypocrisy.
And,
Caroline,
are
we
never
to
see
you
at
Hollow's
Cottage
again?"
"I
suppose
not,
unless
my
uncle
should
change
his
mind."
"Are
you
much
alone
now?"
"Yes,
a
good
deal.
I
have
little
pleasure
in
any
society
but
Miss
Keeldar's."
"Have
you
been
quite
well
lately?"
"Quite."
"You
must
take
care
of
yourself.
Be
sure
not
to
neglect
exercise.
Do
you
know
I
fancied
you
somewhat
altered
a
little
fallen
away,
and
pale.
Is
your
uncle
kind
to
you?"
"Yes;
he
is
just
as
he
always
is."
"Not
too
tender,
that
is
to
say
not
too
protective
and
attentive.
And
what
ails
you,
then?
Tell
me,
Lina."
"Nothing,
Robert."
But
her
voice
faltered.
"That
is
to
say,
nothing
that
you
will
tell
me.
I
am
not
to
be
taken
into
confidence.
Separation
is
then
quite
to
estrange
us,
is
it?"
"I
do
not
know.
Sometimes
I
almost
fear
it
is."
"But
it
ought
not
to
have
that
effect.
'Should
auld
acquaintance
be
forgot,
and
days
o'
lang
syne?'"
"Robert,
I
don't
forget."
"It
is
two
months,
I
should
think,
Caroline,
since
you
were
at
the
cottage."
"Since
I
was
within
it
yes."
"Have
you
ever
passed
that
way
in
your
walk?"
"I
have
come
to
the
top
of
the
fields
sometimes
of
an
evening
and
looked
down.
Once
I
saw
Hortense
in
the
garden
watering
her
flowers,
and
I
know
at
what
time
you
light
your
lamp
in
the
counting
house.
I
have
waited
for
it
to
shine
out
now
and
then,
and
I
have
seen
you
bend
between
it
and
the
window.
I
knew
it
was
you;
I
could
almost
trace
the
