me."
"Caroline,"
demanded
Miss
Keeldar
abruptly,
"don't
you
wish
you
had
a
profession
a
trade?"
"I
wish
it
fifty
times
a
day.
As
it
is,
I
often
wonder
what
I
came
into
the
world
for.
I
long
to
have
something
absorbing
and
compulsory
to
fill
my
head
and
hands
and
to
occupy
my
thoughts."
"Can
labour
alone
make
a
human
being
happy?"
"No;
but
it
can
give
varieties
of
pain,
and
prevent
us
from
breaking
our
hearts
with
a
single
tyrant
master
torture.
Besides,
successful
labour
has
its
recompense;
a
vacant,
weary,
lonely,
hopeless
life
has
none."
"But
hard
labour
and
learned
professions,
they
say,
make
women
masculine,
coarse,
unwomanly."
"And
what
does
it
signify
whether
unmarried
and
never
to
be
married
women
are
unattractive
and
inelegant
or
not?
Provided
only
they
are
decent,
decorous,
and
neat,
it
is
enough.
The
utmost
which
ought
to
be
required
of
old
maids,
in
the
way
of
appearance,
is
that
they
should
not
absolutely
offend
men's
eyes
as
they
pass
them
in
the
street;
for
the
rest,
they
should
be
allowed,
without
too
much
scorn,
to
be
as
absorbed,
grave,
plain
looking,
and
plain
dressed
as
they
please."
"You
might
be
an
old
maid
yourself,
Caroline,
you
speak
so
earnestly."
"I
shall
be
one.
It
is
my
destiny.
I
will
never
marry
a
Malone
or
a
Sykes;
and
no
one
else
will
ever
marry
me."
Here
fell
a
long
pause.
Shirley
broke
it.
Again
the
name
by
which
she
seemed
bewitched
was
almost
the
first
on
her
lips.
"Lina
did
not
Moore
call
you
Lina
sometimes?"
"Yes.
It
is
sometimes
used
as
the
abbreviation
of
Caroline
in
his
native
country."
"Well,
Lina,
do
you
remember
my
one
day
noticing
an
inequality
in
your
hair
a
curl
wanting
on
that
right
side
and
your
telling
me
that
it
was
Robert's
fault,
as
he
had
once
cut
therefrom
a
long
lock?"
"Yes."
"If
he
is,
and
always
was,
as
indifferent
to
you
as
you
say,
why
did
he
steal
your
hair?"
"I
don't
know
yes,
I
do.
It
was
my
doing,
not
his.
Everything
of
that
sort
always
was
my
doing.
He
was
going
from
home
to
London,
as
usual;
and
the
night
before
he
went,
I
had
found
in
his
sister's
workbox
a
lock
of
black
hair
a
short,
round
curl.
Hortense
told
me
it
was
her
brother's,
and
a
keepsake.
He
was
sitting
near
the
table.
I
looked
at
his
head.
He
has
plenty
of
hair;
on
the
temples
were
many
such
round
curls.
I
thought
he
could
spare
me
one.
I
knew
I
should
like
to
have
it,
and
I
asked
for
it.
He
said,
on
condition
that
he
might
have
his
choice
of
a
tress
from
my
head.
So
he
got
one
of
my
long
locks
of
hair,
and
I
got
one
of
his
short
ones.
I
keep
his,
but
I
dare
say
he
has
lost
mine.
It
was
my
doing,
and
one
of
those
silly
deeds
it
distresses
the
heart
