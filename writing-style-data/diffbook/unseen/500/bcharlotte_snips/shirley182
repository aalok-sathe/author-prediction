him,
as
you
mean
to
stand
by
him,
till
death."
"And
now,
Lina,
though
your
eyes
don't
flash,
they
glow.
You
drop
your
lids;
but
I
saw
a
kindled
spark.
However,
it
is
not
yet
come
to
fighting.
What
I
want
to
do
is
to
prevent
mischief.
I
cannot
forget,
either
day
or
night,
that
these
embittered
feelings
of
the
poor
against
the
rich
have
been
generated
in
suffering:
they
would
neither
hate
nor
envy
us
if
they
did
not
deem
us
so
much
happier
than
themselves.
To
allay
this
suffering,
and
thereby
lessen
this
hate,
let
me,
out
of
my
abundance,
give
abundantly;
and
that
the
donation
may
go
farther,
let
it
be
made
wisely.
To
that
intent,
we
must
introduce
some
clear,
calm,
practical
sense
into
our
councils.
So
go
and
fetch
Miss
Ainley."
Without
another
word
Caroline
put
on
her
bonnet
and
departed.
It
may,
perhaps,
appear
strange
that
neither
she
nor
Shirley
thought
of
consulting
Mrs.
Pryor
on
their
scheme;
but
they
were
wise
in
abstaining.
To
have
consulted
her
and
this
they
knew
by
instinct
would
only
have
been
to
involve
her
in
painful
embarrassment.
She
was
far
better
informed,
better
read,
a
deeper
thinker
than
Miss
Ainley,
but
of
administrative
energy,
of
executive
activity,
she
had
none.
She
would
subscribe
her
own
modest
mite
to
a
charitable
object
willingly
secret
almsgiving
suited
her;
but
in
public
plans,
on
a
large
scale,
she
could
take
no
part;
as
to
originating
them,
that
was
out
of
the
question.
This
Shirley
knew,
and
therefore
she
did
not
trouble
Mrs.
Pryor
by
unavailing
conferences,
which
could
only
remind
her
of
her
own
deficiencies,
and
do
no
good.
It
was
a
bright
day
for
Miss
Ainley
when
she
was
summoned
to
Fieldhead
to
deliberate
on
projects
so
congenial
to
her;
when
she
was
seated
with
all
honour
and
deference
at
a
table
with
paper,
pen,
ink,
and
what
was
best
of
all
cash
before
her,
and
requested
to
draw
up
a
regular
plan
for
administering
relief
to
the
destitute
poor
of
Briarfield.
She,
who
knew
them
all,
had
studied
their
wants,
had
again
and
again
felt
in
what
way
they
might
best
be
succoured,
could
the
means
of
succour
only
be
found,
was
fully
competent
to
the
undertaking,
and
a
meek
exultation
gladdened
her
kind
heart
as
she
felt
herself
able
to
answer
clearly
and
promptly
the
eager
questions
put
by
the
two
young
girls,
as
she
showed
them
in
her
answers
how
much
and
what
serviceable
knowledge
she
had
acquired
of
the
condition
of
her
fellow
creatures
around
her.
Shirley
placed
at
her
disposal
300,
and
at
sight
of
the
money
Miss
Ainley's
eyes
filled
with
joyful
tears;
for
she
already
saw
the
hungry
fed,
the
naked
clothed,
the
sick
comforted
thereby.
She
quickly
drew
up
a
simple,
sensible
plan
for
its
expenditure;
and
she
assured
them
brighter
times
would
now
come
round,
for
she
doubted
not
the
lady
of
Fieldhead's
example
would
be
followed
by
others.
She
