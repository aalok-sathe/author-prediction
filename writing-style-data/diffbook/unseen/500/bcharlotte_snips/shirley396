that
Mrs.
Pryor
objects
to
her
going
out,
and
I
should
miss
her
after
all,
it
will
vex
me;
but,
tempest
or
tornado,
hail
or
ice,
she
ought
to
come,
and
if
she
has
a
mind
worthy
of
her
eyes
and
features
she
will
come.
She
will
be
here
for
the
chance
of
seeing
me,
as
I
am
here
for
the
chance
of
seeing
her.
She
will
want
to
get
a
word
respecting
her
confounded
sweetheart,
as
I
want
to
get
another
flavour
of
what
I
think
the
essence
of
life
a
taste
of
existence,
with
the
spirit
preserved
in
it,
and
not
evaporated.
Adventure
is
to
stagnation
what
champagne
is
to
flat
porter."
He
looked
round.
The
church
was
cold,
silent,
empty,
but
for
one
old
woman.
As
the
chimes
subsided
and
the
single
bell
tolled
slowly,
another
and
another
elderly
parishioner
came
dropping
in,
and
took
a
humble
station
in
the
free
sittings.
It
is
always
the
frailest,
the
oldest,
and
the
poorest
that
brave
the
worst
weather,
to
prove
and
maintain
their
constancy
to
dear
old
mother
church.
This
wild
morning
not
one
affluent
family
attended,
not
one
carriage
party
appeared
all
the
lined
and
cushioned
pews
were
empty;
only
on
the
bare
oaken
seats
sat
ranged
the
gray
haired
elders
and
feeble
paupers.
"I'll
scorn
her
if
she
doesn't
come,"
muttered
Martin,
shortly
and
savagely,
to
himself.
The
rector's
shovel
hat
had
passed
the
porch.
Mr.
Helstone
and
his
clerk
were
in
the
vestry.
The
bells
ceased
the
reading
desk
was
filled
the
doors
were
closed
the
service
commenced.
Void
stood
the
rectory
pew
she
was
not
there.
Martin
scorned
her.
"Worthless
thing!
vapid
thing!
commonplace
humbug!
Like
all
other
girls
weakly,
selfish,
shallow!"
Such
was
Martin's
liturgy.
"She
is
not
like
our
picture.
Her
eyes
are
not
large
and
expressive;
her
nose
is
not
straight,
delicate,
Hellenic;
her
mouth
has
not
that
charm
I
thought
it
had,
which
I
imagined
could
beguile
me
of
sullenness
in
my
worst
moods.
What
is
she?
A
thread
paper,
a
doll,
a
toy,
a
girl,
in
short."
So
absorbed
was
the
young
cynic
he
forgot
to
rise
from
his
knees
at
the
proper
place,
and
was
still
in
an
exemplary
attitude
of
devotion
when,
the
litany
over,
the
first
hymn
was
given
out.
To
be
so
caught
did
not
contribute
to
soothe
him.
He
started
up
red
(for
he
was
as
sensitive
to
ridicule
as
any
girl).
To
make
the
matter
worse,
the
church
door
had
reopened,
and
the
aisles
were
filling:
patter,
patter,
patter,
a
hundred
little
feet
trotted
in.
It
was
the
Sunday
scholars.
According
to
Briarfield
winter
custom,
these
children
had
till
now
been
kept
where
there
was
a
warm
stove,
and
only
led
into
church
just
before
the
communion
and
sermon.
The
little
ones
were
settled
first,
and
at
last,
when
the
boys
and
the
younger
girls
were
all
arranged
when
the
organ
was
swelling
high,
and
the
choir
and
congregation
were
rising
to
uplift
