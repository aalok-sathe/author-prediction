humour,"
replied
Miss
Helstone,
very
truly.
Shirley
had
already
fixed
on
her
a
penetrating
eye.
"No,"
she
said;
"I
see
you
are
not
in
the
humour
for
loving
me.
You
are
in
one
of
your
sunless,
inclement
moods,
when
one
feels
a
fellow
creature's
presence
is
not
welcome
to
you.
You
have
such
moods.
Are
you
aware
of
it?"
"Do
you
mean
to
stay
long,
Shirley?"
"Yes.
I
am
come
to
have
my
tea,
and
must
have
it
before
I
go.
I
shall
take
the
liberty,
then,
of
removing
my
bonnet,
without
being
asked."
And
this
she
did,
and
then
stood
on
the
rug
with
her
hands
behind
her.
"A
pretty
expression
you
have
in
your
countenance,"
she
went
on,
still
gazing
keenly,
though
not
inimically
rather
indeed
pityingly
at
Caroline.
"Wonderfully
self
supported
you
look,
you
solitude
seeking,
wounded
deer.
Are
you
afraid
Shirley
will
worry
you
if
she
discovers
that
you
are
hurt,
and
that
you
bleed?"
"I
never
do
fear
Shirley."
"But
sometimes
you
dislike
her;
often
you
avoid
her.
Shirley
can
feel
when
she
is
slighted
and
shunned.
If
you
had
not
walked
home
in
the
company
you
did
last
night,
you
would
have
been
a
different
girl
to
day.
What
time
did
you
reach
the
rectory?"
"By
ten."
"Humph!
You
took
three
quarters
of
an
hour
to
walk
a
mile.
Was
it
you,
or
Moore,
who
lingered
so?"
"Shirley,
you
talk
nonsense."
"He
talked
nonsense
that
I
doubt
not;
or
he
looked
it,
which
is
a
thousand
times
worse.
I
see
the
reflection
of
his
eyes
on
your
forehead
at
this
moment.
I
feel
disposed
to
call
him
out,
if
I
could
only
get
a
trustworthy
second.
I
feel
desperately
irritated.
I
felt
so
last
night,
and
have
felt
it
all
day."
"You
don't
ask
me
why,"
she
proceeded,
after
a
pause,
"you
little
silent,
over
modest
thing;
and
you
don't
deserve
that
I
should
pour
out
my
secrets
into
your
lap
without
an
invitation.
Upon
my
word,
I
could
have
found
it
in
my
heart
to
have
dogged
Moore
yesterday
evening
with
dire
intent.
I
have
pistols,
and
can
use
them."
"Stuff,
Shirley!
Which
would
you
have
shot
me
or
Robert?"
"Neither,
perhaps.
Perhaps
myself
more
likely
a
bat
or
a
tree
bough.
He
is
a
puppy,
your
cousin
a
quiet,
serious,
sensible,
judicious,
ambitious
puppy.
I
see
him
standing
before
me,
talking
his
half
stern,
half
gentle
talk,
bearing
me
down
(as
I
am
very
conscious
he
does)
with
his
fixity
of
purpose,
etc.;
and
then
I
have
no
patience
with
him!"
Miss
Keeldar
started
off
on
a
rapid
walk
through
the
room,
repeating
energetically
that
she
had
no
patience
with
men
in
general,
and
with
her
tenant
in
particular.
"You
are
mistaken,"
urged
Caroline,
in
some
anxiety.
"Robert
is
no
puppy
or
male
flirt;
I
can
vouch
for
that."
"You
vouch
for
it!
Do
you
think
I'll
take
your
word
on
the
subject?
There
is
no
one's
testimony
I
would
not
credit
