bonnet
and
summer
shawl,
and
to
take
a
walk
with
her
up
towards
the
narrow
end
of
the
Hollow.
Here
the
opposing
sides
of
the
glen,
approaching
each
other
and
becoming
clothed
with
brushwood
and
stunted
oaks,
formed
a
wooded
ravine,
at
the
bottom
of
which
ran
the
mill
stream,
in
broken,
unquiet
course,
struggling
with
many
stones,
chafing
against
rugged
banks,
fretting
with
gnarled
tree
roots,
foaming,
gurgling,
battling
as
it
went.
Here,
when
you
had
wandered
half
a
mile
from
the
mill,
you
found
a
sense
of
deep
solitude
found
it
in
the
shade
of
unmolested
trees,
received
it
in
the
singing
of
many
birds,
for
which
that
shade
made
a
home.
This
was
no
trodden
way.
The
freshness
of
the
wood
flowers
attested
that
foot
of
man
seldom
pressed
them;
the
abounding
wild
roses
looked
as
if
they
budded,
bloomed,
and
faded
under
the
watch
of
solitude,
as
if
in
a
sultan's
harem.
Here
you
saw
the
sweet
azure
of
blue
bells,
and
recognized
in
pearl
white
blossoms,
spangling
the
grass,
a
humble
type
of
some
starlit
spot
in
space.
Mrs.
Pryor
liked
a
quiet
walk.
She
ever
shunned
high
roads,
and
sought
byways
and
lonely
lanes.
One
companion
she
preferred
to
total
solitude,
for
in
solitude
she
was
nervous;
a
vague
fear
of
annoying
encounters
broke
the
enjoyment
of
quite
lonely
rambles.
But
she
feared
nothing
with
Caroline.
When
once
she
got
away
from
human
habitations,
and
entered
the
still
demesne
of
nature
accompanied
by
this
one
youthful
friend,
a
propitious
change
seemed
to
steal
over
her
mind
and
beam
in
her
countenance.
When
with
Caroline
and
Caroline
only
her
heart,
you
would
have
said,
shook
off
a
burden,
her
brow
put
aside
a
veil,
her
spirits
too
escaped
from
a
restraint.
With
her
she
was
cheerful;
with
her,
at
times,
she
was
tender;
to
her
she
would
impart
her
knowledge,
reveal
glimpses
of
her
experience,
give
her
opportunities
for
guessing
what
life
she
had
lived,
what
cultivation
her
mind
had
received,
of
what
calibre
was
her
intelligence,
how
and
where
her
feelings
were
vulnerable.
To
day,
for
instance,
as
they
walked
along,
Mrs.
Pryor
talked
to
her
companion
about
the
various
birds
singing
in
the
trees,
discriminated
their
species,
and
said
something
about
their
habits
and
peculiarities.
English
natural
history
seemed
familiar
to
her.
All
the
wild
flowers
round
their
path
were
recognized
by
her;
tiny
plants
springing
near
stones
and
peeping
out
of
chinks
in
old
walls
plants
such
as
Caroline
had
scarcely
noticed
before
received
a
name
and
an
intimation
of
their
properties.
It
appeared
that
she
had
minutely
studied
the
botany
of
English
fields
and
woods.
Having
reached
the
head
of
the
ravine,
they
sat
down
together
on
a
ledge
of
gray
and
mossy
rock
jutting
from
the
base
of
a
steep
green
hill
which
towered
above
them.
She
looked
round
her,
and
spoke
of
the
neighbourhood
as
she
had
once
before
seen
it
long
ago.
She
alluded
to
its
changes,
and
