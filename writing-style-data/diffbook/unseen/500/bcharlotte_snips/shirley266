like
her
relatives?"
She
had
nothing
in
common
with
them,
she
replied.
Little
Harry
Sympson,
indeed,
the
sole
son
of
the
family,
was
very
unlike
his
sisters,
and
of
him
she
had
formerly
been
fond;
but
he
was
not
coming
to
Yorkshire
at
least
not
yet.
The
next
Sunday
the
Fieldhead
pew
in
Briarfield
Church
appeared
peopled
with
a
prim,
trim,
fidgety,
elderly
gentleman,
who
shifted
his
spectacles,
and
changed
his
position
every
three
minutes;
a
patient,
placid
looking
elderly
lady
in
brown
satin;
and
two
pattern
young
ladies,
in
pattern
attire,
with
pattern
deportment.
Shirley
had
the
air
of
a
black
swan
or
a
white
crow
in
the
midst
of
this
party,
and
very
forlorn
was
her
aspect.
Having
brought
her
into
respectable
society,
we
will
leave
her
there
a
while,
and
look
after
Miss
Helstone.
Separated
from
Miss
Keeldar
for
the
present,
as
she
could
not
seek
her
in
the
midst
of
her
fine
relatives,
scared
away
from
Fieldhead
by
the
visiting
commotion
which
the
new
arrivals
occasioned
in
the
neighbourhood,
Caroline
was
limited
once
more
to
the
gray
rectory,
the
solitary
morning
walk
in
remote
by
paths,
the
long,
lonely
afternoon
sitting
in
a
quiet
parlour
which
the
sun
forsook
at
noon,
or
in
the
garden
alcove
where
it
shone
bright,
yet
sad,
on
the
ripening
red
currants
trained
over
the
trellis,
and
on
the
fair
monthly
roses
entwined
between,
and
through
them
fell
chequered
on
Caroline
sitting
in
her
white
summer
dress,
still
as
a
garden
statue.
There
she
read
old
books,
taken
from
her
uncle's
library.
The
Greek
and
Latin
were
of
no
use
to
her,
and
its
collection
of
light
literature
was
chiefly
contained
on
a
shelf
which
had
belonged
to
her
aunt
Mary
some
venerable
Lady's
Magazines,
that
had
once
performed
a
sea
voyage
with
their
owner,
and
undergone
a
storm,
and
whose
pages
were
stained
with
salt
water;
some
mad
Methodist
Magazines,
full
of
miracles
and
apparitions,
of
preternatural
warnings,
ominous
dreams,
and
frenzied
fanaticism;
the
equally
mad
letters
of
Mrs.
Elizabeth
Rowe
from
the
Dead
to
the
Living;
a
few
old
English
classics.
From
these
faded
flowers
Caroline
had
in
her
childhood
extracted
the
honey;
they
were
tasteless
to
her
now.
By
way
of
change,
and
also
of
doing
good,
she
would
sew
make
garments
for
the
poor,
according
to
good
Miss
Ainley's
direction.
Sometimes,
as
she
felt
and
saw
her
tears
fall
slowly
on
her
work,
she
would
wonder
how
the
excellent
woman
who
had
cut
it
out
and
arranged
it
for
her
managed
to
be
so
equably
serene
in
her
solitude.
"I
never
find
Miss
Ainley
oppressed
with
despondency
or
lost
in
grief,"
she
thought;
"yet
her
cottage
is
a
still,
dim
little
place,
and
she
is
without
a
bright
hope
or
near
friend
in
the
world.
I
remember,
though,
she
told
me
once
she
had
tutored
her
thoughts
to
tend
upwards
to
heaven.
She
allowed
there
was,
and
ever
had
been,
little
enjoyment
in
this
world
for
her,
