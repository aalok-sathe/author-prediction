exertion.
It
was
the
blackness
the
bright
fire
leaves
when
its
blaze
is
sunk,
its
warmth
failed,
and
its
glow
faded.
"This
is
what
I
wished
to
prevent,"
she
said,
in
a
voice
whose
cadence
betrayed
the
altered
impulse
of
her
heart.
"But
you
could
not
prevent
it;
you
did
your
best
it
was
in
vain,"
said
Caroline
comfortingly.
"Don't
grieve,
Shirley."
"I
am
sorry
for
those
poor
fellows,"
was
the
answer,
while
the
spark
in
her
glance
dissolved
to
dew.
"Are
any
within
the
mill
hurt,
I
wonder?
Is
that
your
uncle?"
"It
is,
and
there
is
Mr.
Malone;
and,
O
Shirley,
there
is
Robert!"
"Well"
(resuming
her
former
tone),
"don't
squeeze
your
fingers
quite
into
my
hand.
I
see.
There
is
nothing
wonderful
in
that.
We
knew
he,
at
least,
was
here,
whoever
might
be
absent."
"He
is
coming
here
towards
us,
Shirley!"
"Towards
the
pump,
that
is
to
say,
for
the
purpose
of
washing
his
hands
and
his
forehead,
which
has
got
a
scratch,
I
perceive."
"He
bleeds,
Shirley.
Don't
hold
me.
I
must
go."
"Not
a
step."
"He
is
hurt,
Shirley!"
"Fiddlestick!"
"But
I
must
go
to
him.
I
wish
to
go
so
much.
I
cannot
bear
to
be
restrained."
"What
for?"
"To
speak
to
him,
to
ask
how
he
is,
and
what
I
can
do
for
him."
"To
tease
and
annoy
him;
to
make
a
spectacle
of
yourself
and
him
before
those
soldiers,
Mr.
Malone,
your
uncle,
et
cetera.
Would
he
like
it,
think
you?
Would
you
like
to
remember
it
a
week
hence?"
"Am
I
always
to
be
curbed
and
kept
down?"
demanded
Caroline,
a
little
passionately.
"For
his
sake,
yes;
and
still
more
for
your
own.
I
tell
you,
if
you
showed
yourself
now
you
would
repent
it
an
hour
hence,
and
so
would
Robert."
"You
think
he
would
not
like
it,
Shirley?"
"Far
less
than
he
would
like
our
stopping
him
to
say
good
night,
which
you
were
so
sore
about."
"But
that
was
all
play;
there
was
no
danger."
"And
this
is
serious
work;
he
must
be
unmolested."
"I
only
wish
to
go
to
him
because
he
is
my
cousin
you
understand?"
"I
quite
understand.
But
now,
watch
him.
He
has
bathed
his
forehead,
and
the
blood
has
ceased
trickling.
His
hurt
is
really
a
mere
graze;
I
can
see
it
from
hence.
He
is
going
to
look
after
the
wounded
men."
Accordingly
Mr.
Moore
and
Mr.
Helstone
went
round
the
yard,
examining
each
prostrate
form.
They
then
gave
directions
to
have
the
wounded
taken
up
and
carried
into
the
mill.
This
duty
being
performed,
Joe
Scott
was
ordered
to
saddle
his
master's
horse
and
Mr.
Helstone's
pony,
and
the
two
gentlemen
rode
away
full
gallop,
to
seek
surgical
aid
in
different
directions.
Caroline
was
not
yet
pacified.
"Shirley,
Shirley,
I
should
have
liked
to
speak
one
word
to
him
before
he
went,"
she
murmured,
while
the
tears
gathered
glittering
in
her
eyes.
"Why
do
you
cry,
Lina?"
asked
Miss
Keeldar
