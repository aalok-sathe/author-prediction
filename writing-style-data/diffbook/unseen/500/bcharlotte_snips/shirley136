liked
it
and
her,
and
in
ten
minutes
they
would
have
been
friends.
But
Mr.
Helstone
stood
on
the
rug
looking
at
them
both,
looking
especially
at
the
strange
lady
with
his
sarcastic,
keen
eye,
that
clearly
expressed
impatience
of
her
chilly
ceremony,
and
annoyance
at
her
want
of
aplomb.
His
hard
gaze
and
rasping
voice
discomfited
the
lady
more
and
more.
She
tried,
however,
to
get
up
little
speeches
about
the
weather,
the
aspect
of
the
country,
etc.;
but
the
impracticable
Mr.
Helstone
presently
found
himself
somewhat
deaf.
Whatever
she
said
he
affected
not
to
hear
distinctly,
and
she
was
obliged
to
go
over
each
elaborately
constructed
nothing
twice.
The
effort
soon
became
too
much
for
her.
She
was
just
rising
in
a
perplexed
flutter,
nervously
murmuring
that
she
knew
not
what
detained
Miss
Keeldar,
that
she
would
go
and
look
for
her,
when
Miss
Keeldar
saved
her
the
trouble
by
appearing.
It
was
to
be
presumed
at
least
that
she
who
now
came
in
through
a
glass
door
from
the
garden
owned
that
name.
There
is
real
grace
in
ease
of
manner,
and
so
old
Helstone
felt
when
an
erect,
slight
girl
walked
up
to
him,
retaining
with
her
left
hand
her
little
silk
apron
full
of
flowers,
and,
giving
him
her
right
hand,
said
pleasantly,
"I
knew
you
would
come
to
see
me,
though
you
do
think
Mr.
Yorke
has
made
me
a
Jacobin.
Good
morning."
"But
we'll
not
have
you
a
Jacobin,"
returned
he.
"No,
Miss
Shirley;
they
shall
not
steal
the
flower
of
my
parish
from
me.
Now
that
you
are
amongst
us,
you
shall
be
my
pupil
in
politics
and
religion;
I'll
teach
you
sound
doctrine
on
both
points."
"Mrs.
Pryor
has
anticipated
you,"
she
replied,
turning
to
the
elder
lady.
"Mrs.
Pryor,
you
know,
was
my
governess,
and
is
still
my
friend;
and
of
all
the
high
and
rigid
Tories
she
is
queen;
of
all
the
stanch
churchwomen
she
is
chief.
I
have
been
well
drilled
both
in
theology
and
history,
I
assure
you,
Mr.
Helstone."
The
rector
immediately
bowed
very
low
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
and
expressed
himself
obliged
to
her.
The
ex
governess
disclaimed
skill
either
in
political
or
religious
controversy,
explained
that
she
thought
such
matters
little
adapted
for
female
minds,
but
avowed
herself
in
general
terms
the
advocate
of
order
and
loyalty,
and,
of
course,
truly
attached
to
the
Establishment.
She
added
she
was
ever
averse
to
change
under
any
circumstances,
and
something
scarcely
audible
about
the
extreme
danger
of
being
too
ready
to
take
up
new
ideas
closed
her
sentence.
"Miss
Keeldar
thinks
as
you
think,
I
hope,
madam."
"Difference
of
age
and
difference
of
temperament
occasion
difference
of
sentiment,"
was
the
reply.
"It
can
scarcely
be
expected
that
the
eager
and
young
should
hold
the
opinions
of
the
cool
and
middle
aged."
"Oh!
oh!
we
are
independent;
we
think
for
ourselves!"
cried
Mr.
Helstone.
"We
are
a
little
Jacobin,
for
anything
I
know
a
little
freethinker,
in
good
