more!
Why,
I
expected
you
to
head
the
list
with
a
cool
hundred.
With
your
property,
you
should
never
put
down
a
signature
for
less."
She
was
silent.
"In
the
south,"
went
on
Donne,
"a
lady
with
a
thousand
a
year
would
be
ashamed
to
give
five
pounds
for
a
public
object."
Shirley,
so
rarely
haughty,
looked
so
now.
Her
slight
frame
became
nerved;
her
distinguished
face
quickened
with
scorn.
"Strange
remarks?"
said
she
"most
inconsiderate!
Reproach
in
return
for
bounty
is
misplaced."
"Bounty!
Do
you
call
five
pounds
bounty?"
"I
do;
and
bounty
which,
had
I
not
given
it
to
Dr.
Boultby's
intended
school,
of
the
erection
of
which
I
approve,
and
in
no
sort
to
his
curate,
who
seems
ill
advised
in
his
manner
of
applying
for,
or
rather
extorting,
subscriptions
bounty,
I
repeat,
which,
but
for
this
consideration,
I
should
instantly
reclaim."
Donne
was
thick
skinned.
He
did
not
feel
all
or
half
that
the
tone,
air,
glance
of
the
speaker
expressed.
He
knew
not
on
what
ground
he
stood.
"Wretched
place
this
Yorkshire,"
he
went
on.
"I
could
never
have
formed
an
idear
of
the
country
had
I
not
seen
it.
And
the
people
rich
and
poor
what
a
set!
How
corse
and
uncultivated!
They
would
be
scouted
in
the
south."
Shirley
leaned
forwards
on
the
table,
her
nostrils
dilating
a
little,
her
taper
fingers
interlaced
and
compressing
each
other
hard.
"The
rich,"
pursued
the
infatuated
and
unconscious
Donne,
"are
a
parcel
of
misers,
never
living
as
persons
with
their
incomes
ought
to
live.
You
scarsley"
(you
must
excuse
Mr.
Donne's
pronunciation,
reader;
it
was
very
choice;
he
considered
it
genteel,
and
prided
himself
on
his
southern
accent;
northern
ears
received
with
singular
sensations
his
utterance
of
certain
words)
"you
scarsley
ever
see
a
fam'ly
where
a
propa
carriage
or
a
reg'la
butla
is
kep;
and
as
to
the
poor
just
look
at
them
when
they
come
crowding
about
the
church
doors
on
the
occasion
of
a
marriage
or
a
funeral,
clattering
in
clogs;
the
men
in
their
shirt
sleeves
and
wool
combers'
aprons,
the
women
in
mob
caps
and
bed
gowns.
They
positively
deserve
that
one
should
turn
a
mad
cow
in
amongst
them
to
rout
their
rabble
ranks.
He
he!
what
fun
it
would
be!"
"There!
you
have
reached
the
climax,"
said
Shirley
quietly.
"You
have
reached
the
climax,"
she
repeated,
turning
her
glowing
glance
towards
him.
"You
cannot
go
beyond
it,
and,"
she
added
with
emphasis,
"you
shall
not,
in
my
house."
Up
she
rose
nobody
could
control
her
now,
for
she
was
exasperated
straight
she
walked
to
her
garden
gates,
wide
she
flung
them
open.
"Walk
through,"
she
said
austerely,
"and
pretty
quickly,
and
set
foot
on
this
pavement
no
more."
Donne
was
astounded.
He
had
thought
all
the
time
he
was
showing
himself
off
to
high
advantage,
as
a
lofty
souled
person
of
the
first
"ton;"
he
imagined
he
was
producing
a
crushing
impression.
Had
he
not
expressed
disdain
of
everything
