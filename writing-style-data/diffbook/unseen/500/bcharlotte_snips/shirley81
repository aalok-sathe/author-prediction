would
be,
had
opened
the
piano,
and
produced
music
books
in
readiness),
music
was
asked
for.
This
was
Mr.
Sweeting's
chance
for
showing
off.
He
was
eager
to
commence.
He
undertook,
therefore,
the
arduous
task
of
persuading
the
young
ladies
to
favour
the
company
with
an
air
a
song.
Con
amore
he
went
through
the
whole
business
of
begging,
praying,
resisting
excuses,
explaining
away
difficulties,
and
at
last
succeeded
in
persuading
Miss
Harriet
to
allow
herself
to
be
led
to
the
instrument.
Then
out
came
the
pieces
of
his
flute
(he
always
carried
them
in
his
pocket,
as
unfailingly
as
he
carried
his
handkerchief).
They
were
screwed
and
arranged,
Malone
and
Donne
meanwhile
herding
together
and
sneering
at
him,
which
the
little
man,
glancing
over
his
shoulder,
saw,
but
did
not
heed
at
all.
He
was
persuaded
their
sarcasm
all
arose
from
envy.
They
could
not
accompany
the
ladies
as
he
could;
he
was
about
to
enjoy
a
triumph
over
them.
The
triumph
began.
Malone,
much
chagrined
at
hearing
him
pipe
up
in
most
superior
style,
determined
to
earn
distinction
too,
if
possible,
and
all
at
once
assuming
the
character
of
a
swain
(which
character
he
had
endeavoured
to
enact
once
or
twice
before,
but
in
which
he
had
not
hitherto
met
with
the
success
he
doubtless
opined
his
merits
deserved),
approached
a
sofa
on
which
Miss
Helstone
was
seated,
and
depositing
his
great
Irish
frame
near
her,
tried
his
hand
(or
rather
tongue)
at
a
fine
speech
or
two,
accompanied
by
grins
the
most
extraordinary
and
incomprehensible.
In
the
course
of
his
efforts
to
render
himself
agreeable,
he
contrived
to
possess
himself
of
the
two
long
sofa
cushions
and
a
square
one;
with
which,
after
rolling
them
about
for
some
time
with
strange
gestures,
he
managed
to
erect
a
sort
of
barrier
between
himself
and
the
object
of
his
attentions.
Caroline,
quite
willing
that
they
should
be
sundered,
soon
devised
an
excuse
for
stepping
over
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
room,
and
taking
up
a
position
beside
Mrs.
Sykes,
of
which
good
lady
she
entreated
some
instruction
in
a
new
stitch
in
ornamental
knitting,
a
favour
readily
granted;
and
thus
Peter
Augustus
was
thrown
out.
Very
sullenly
did
his
countenance
lower
when
he
saw
himself
abandoned
left
entirely
to
his
own
resources,
on
a
large
sofa,
with
the
charge
of
three
small
cushions
on
his
hands.
The
fact
was,
he
felt
disposed
seriously
to
cultivate
acquaintance
with
Miss
Helstone,
because
he
thought,
in
common
with
others,
that
her
uncle
possessed
money,
and
concluded
that,
since
he
had
no
children,
he
would
probably
leave
it
to
his
niece.
Gerard
Moore
was
better
instructed
on
this
point:
he
had
seen
the
neat
church
that
owed
its
origin
to
the
rector's
zeal
and
cash,
and
more
than
once,
in
his
inmost
soul,
had
cursed
an
expensive
caprice
which
crossed
his
wishes.
The
evening
seemed
long
to
one
person
in
that
room.
Caroline
at
intervals
dropped
her
knitting
on
her
lap,
and
