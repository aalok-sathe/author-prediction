on
the
skirts
of
Whinbury,
walk
forward
into
the
little
parlour.
There
they
are
at
dinner.
Allow
me
to
introduce
them
to
you:
Mr.
Donne,
curate
of
Whinbury;
Mr.
Malone,
curate
of
Briarfield;
Mr.
Sweeting,
curate
of
Nunnely.
These
are
Mr.
Donne's
lodgings,
being
the
habitation
of
one
John
Gale,
a
small
clothier.
Mr.
Donne
has
kindly
invited
his
brethren
to
regale
with
him.
You
and
I
will
join
the
party,
see
what
is
to
be
seen,
and
hear
what
is
to
be
heard.
At
present,
however,
they
are
only
eating;
and
while
they
eat
we
will
talk
aside.
These
gentlemen
are
in
the
bloom
of
youth;
they
possess
all
the
activity
of
that
interesting
age
an
activity
which
their
moping
old
vicars
would
fain
turn
into
the
channel
of
their
pastoral
duties,
often
expressing
a
wish
to
see
it
expended
in
a
diligent
superintendence
of
the
schools,
and
in
frequent
visits
to
the
sick
of
their
respective
parishes.
But
the
youthful
Levites
feel
this
to
be
dull
work;
they
prefer
lavishing
their
energies
on
a
course
of
proceeding
which,
though
to
other
eyes
it
appear
more
heavy
with
ennui,
more
cursed
with
monotony,
than
the
toil
of
the
weaver
at
his
loom,
seems
to
yield
them
an
unfailing
supply
of
enjoyment
and
occupation.
I
allude
to
a
rushing
backwards
and
forwards,
amongst
themselves,
to
and
from
their
respective
lodgings
not
a
round,
but
a
triangle
of
visits,
which
they
keep
up
all
the
year
through,
in
winter,
spring,
summer,
and
autumn.
Season
and
weather
make
no
difference;
with
unintelligible
zeal
they
dare
snow
and
hail,
wind
and
rain,
mire
and
dust,
to
go
and
dine,
or
drink
tea,
or
sup
with
each
other.
What
attracts
them
it
would
be
difficult
to
say.
It
is
not
friendship,
for
whenever
they
meet
they
quarrel.
It
is
not
religion
the
thing
is
never
named
amongst
them;
theology
they
may
discuss
occasionally,
but
piety
never.
It
is
not
the
love
of
eating
and
drinking:
each
might
have
as
good
a
joint
and
pudding,
tea
as
potent,
and
toast
as
succulent,
at
his
own
lodgings,
as
is
served
to
him
at
his
brother's.
Mrs.
Gale,
Mrs.
Hogg,
and
Mrs.
Whipp
their
respective
landladies
affirm
that
"it
is
just
for
naught
else
but
to
give
folk
trouble."
By
"folk"
the
good
ladies
of
course
mean
themselves,
for
indeed
they
are
kept
in
a
continual
"fry"
by
this
system
of
mutual
invasion.
Mr.
Donne
and
his
guests,
as
I
have
said,
are
at
dinner;
Mrs.
Gale
waits
on
them,
but
a
spark
of
the
hot
kitchen
fire
is
in
her
eye.
She
considers
that
the
privilege
of
inviting
a
friend
to
a
meal
occasionally,
without
additional
charge
(a
privilege
included
in
the
terms
on
which
she
lets
her
lodgings),
has
been
quite
sufficiently
exercised
of
late.
The
present
week
is
yet
but
at
Thursday,
and
on
Monday
Mr.
Malone,
the
curate
of
Briarfield,
came
to
breakfast
and
stayed
dinner;
on
Tuesday
Mr.
Malone
and
Mr.
Sweeting
