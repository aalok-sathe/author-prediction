with
her
in
my
life."
"No;
you
are
most
generously
considerate,
indeed,
most
tenderly
indulgent
to
her;
and
you
will
be
considerate
with
mamma.
You
are
a
gentleman
all
through,
Robert,
to
the
bone,
and
nowhere
so
perfect
a
gentleman
as
at
your
own
fireside."
"A
eulogium
I
like;
it
is
very
sweet.
I
am
well
pleased
my
Caroline
should
view
me
in
this
light."
"Mamma
just
thinks
of
you
as
I
do."
"Not
quite,
I
hope?"
"She
does
not
want
to
marry
you
don't
be
vain;
but
she
said
to
me
the
other
day,
'My
dear,
Mr.
Moore
has
pleasing
manners;
he
is
one
of
the
few
gentlemen
I
have
seen
who
combine
politeness
with
an
air
of
sincerity.'"
"'Mamma'
is
rather
a
misanthropist,
is
she
not?
Not
the
best
opinion
of
the
sterner
sex?"
"She
forbears
to
judge
them
as
a
whole,
but
she
has
her
exceptions
whom
she
admires
Louis
and
Mr.
Hall,
and,
of
late,
yourself.
She
did
not
like
you
once;
I
knew
that,
because
she
would
never
speak
of
you.
But,
Robert
"
"Well,
what
now?
What
is
the
new
thought?"
"You
have
not
seen
my
uncle
yet?"
"I
have.
'Mamma'
called
him
into
the
room.
He
consents
conditionally.
If
I
prove
that
I
can
keep
a
wife,
I
may
have
her;
and
I
can
keep
her
better
than
he
thinks
better
than
I
choose
to
boast."
"If
you
get
rich
you
will
do
good
with
your
money,
Robert?"
"I
will
do
good;
you
shall
tell
me
how.
Indeed,
I
have
some
schemes
of
my
own,
which
you
and
I
will
talk
about
on
our
own
hearth
one
day.
I
have
seen
the
necessity
of
doing
good;
I
have
learned
the
downright
folly
of
being
selfish.
Caroline,
I
foresee
what
I
will
now
foretell.
This
war
must
ere
long
draw
to
a
close.
Trade
is
likely
to
prosper
for
some
years
to
come.
There
may
be
a
brief
misunderstanding
between
England
and
America,
but
that
will
not
last.
What
would
you
think
if,
one
day
perhaps
ere
another
ten
years
elapse
Louis
and
I
divide
Briarfield
parish
betwixt
us?
Louis,
at
any
rate,
is
certain
of
power
and
property.
He
will
not
bury
his
talents.
He
is
a
benevolent
fellow,
and
has,
besides,
an
intellect
of
his
own
of
no
trifling
calibre.
His
mind
is
slow
but
strong.
It
must
work.
It
may
work
deliberately,
but
it
will
work
well.
He
will
be
made
magistrate
of
the
district
Shirley
says
he
shall.
She
would
proceed
impetuously
and
prematurely
to
obtain
for
him
this
dignity,
if
he
would
let
her,
but
he
will
not.
As
usual,
he
will
be
in
no
haste.
Ere
he
has
been
master
of
Fieldhead
a
year
all
the
district
will
feel
his
quiet
influence,
and
acknowledge
his
unassuming
superiority.
A
magistrate
is
wanted;
they
will,
in
time,
invest
him
with
the
office
voluntarily
and
unreluctantly.
Everybody
admires
his
future
wife,
and
everybody
will,
in
time,
like
him.
He
is
of
