delusion.
But
I
will
write,
and
say
you
advise
his
return."
"Do
not
say
I
advise
his
return,
but
that
his
return
is
advisable."
The
second
bell
rang,
and
Miss
Keeldar
obeyed
its
call.
Louis
Moore
was
used
to
a
quiet
life.
Being
a
quiet
man,
he
endured
it
better
than
most
men
would.
Having
a
large
world
of
his
own
in
his
own
head
and
heart,
he
tolerated
confinement
to
a
small,
still
corner
of
the
real
world
very
patiently.
How
hushed
is
Fieldhead
this
evening!
All
but
Moore
Miss
Keeldar,
the
whole
family
of
the
Sympsons,
even
Henry
are
gone
to
Nunnely.
Sir
Philip
would
have
them
come;
he
wished
to
make
them
acquainted
with
his
mother
and
sisters,
who
are
now
at
the
priory.
Kind
gentleman
as
the
baronet
is,
he
asked
the
tutor
too;
but
the
tutor
would
much
sooner
have
made
an
appointment
with
the
ghost
of
the
Earl
of
Huntingdon
to
meet
him,
and
a
shadowy
ring
of
his
merry
men,
under
the
canopy
of
the
thickest,
blackest,
oldest
oak
in
Nunnely
Forest.
Yes,
he
would
rather
have
appointed
tryst
with
a
phantom
abbess,
or
mist
pale
nun,
among
the
wet
and
weedy
relics
of
that
ruined
sanctuary
of
theirs,
mouldering
in
the
core
of
the
wood.
Louis
Moore
longs
to
have
something
near
him
to
night;
but
not
the
boy
baronet,
nor
his
benevolent
but
stern
mother,
nor
his
patrician
sisters,
nor
one
soul
of
the
Sympsons.
This
night
is
not
calm;
the
equinox
still
struggles
in
its
storms.
The
wild
rains
of
the
day
are
abated;
the
great
single
cloud
disparts
and
rolls
away
from
heaven,
not
passing
and
leaving
a
sea
all
sapphire,
but
tossed
buoyant
before
a
continued,
long
sounding,
high
rushing
moonlight
tempest.
The
moon
reigns
glorious,
glad
of
the
gale,
as
glad
as
if
she
gave
herself
to
his
fierce
caress
with
love.
No
Endymion
will
watch
for
his
goddess
to
night.
There
are
no
flocks
out
on
the
mountains;
and
it
is
well,
for
to
night
she
welcomes
eaolus.
Moore,
sitting
in
the
schoolroom,
heard
the
storm
roar
round
the
other
gable
and
along
the
hall
front.
This
end
was
sheltered.
He
wanted
no
shelter;
he
desired
no
subdued
sounds
or
screened
position.
"All
the
parlours
are
empty,"
said
he.
"I
am
sick
at
heart
of
this
cell."
He
left
it,
and
went
where
the
casements,
larger
and
freer
than
the
branch
screened
lattice
of
his
own
apartment,
admitted
unimpeded
the
dark
blue,
the
silver
fleeced,
the
stirring
and
sweeping
vision
of
the
autumn
night
sky.
He
carried
no
candle;
unneeded
was
lamp
or
fire.
The
broad
and
clear
though
cloud
crossed
and
fluctuating
beam
of
the
moon
shone
on
every
floor
and
wall.
Moore
wanders
through
all
the
rooms.
He
seems
following
a
phantom
from
parlour
to
parlour.
In
the
oak
room
he
stops.
This
is
not
chill,
and
polished,
and
fireless
like
the
salon.
The
hearth
is
hot
and
ruddy;
the
cinders
tinkle
in
the
