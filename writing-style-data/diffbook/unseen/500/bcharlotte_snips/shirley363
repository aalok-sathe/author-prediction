a
brute
and
such
a
puppy."
"Tut!"
said
the
imperturbable
Yorke,
"you
make
too
much
of
it;
but
still,
I
say,
I
am
capped.
Firstly,
that
she
did
not
love
you;
and
secondly,
that
you
did
not
love
her.
You
are
both
young;
you
are
both
handsome;
you
are
both
well
enough
for
wit
and
even
for
temper
take
you
on
the
right
side.
What
ailed
you
that
you
could
not
agree?"
"We
never
have
been,
never
could
be
at
home
with
each
other,
Yorke.
Admire
each
other
as
we
might
at
a
distance,
still
we
jarred
when
we
came
very
near.
I
have
sat
at
one
side
of
a
room
and
observed
her
at
the
other,
perhaps
in
an
excited,
genial
moment,
when
she
had
some
of
her
favourites
round
her
her
old
beaux,
for
instance,
yourself
and
Helstone,
with
whom
she
is
so
playful,
pleasant,
and
eloquent.
I
have
watched
her
when
she
was
most
natural,
most
lively,
and
most
lovely;
my
judgment
has
pronounced
her
beautiful.
Beautiful
she
is
at
times,
when
her
mood
and
her
array
partake
of
the
splendid.
I
have
drawn
a
little
nearer,
feeling
that
our
terms
of
acquaintance
gave
me
the
right
of
approach.
I
have
joined
the
circle
round
her
seat,
caught
her
eye,
and
mastered
her
attention;
then
we
have
conversed;
and
others,
thinking
me,
perhaps,
peculiarly
privileged,
have
withdrawn
by
degrees,
and
left
us
alone.
Were
we
happy
thus
left?
For
myself,
I
must
say
No.
Always
a
feeling
of
constraint
came
over
me;
always
I
was
disposed
to
be
stern
and
strange.
We
talked
politics
and
business.
No
soft
sense
of
domestic
intimacy
ever
opened
our
hearts,
or
thawed
our
language
and
made
it
flow
easy
and
limpid.
If
we
had
confidences,
they
were
confidences
of
the
counting
house,
not
of
the
heart.
Nothing
in
her
cherished
affection
in
me,
made
me
better,
gentler;
she
only
stirred
my
brain
and
whetted
my
acuteness.
She
never
crept
into
my
heart
or
influenced
its
pulse;
and
for
this
good
reason,
no
doubt,
because
I
had
not
the
secret
of
making
her
love
me."
"Well,
lad,
it
is
a
queer
thing.
I
might
laugh
at
thee,
and
reckon
to
despise
thy
refinements;
but
as
it
is
dark
night
and
we
are
by
ourselves,
I
don't
mind
telling
thee
that
thy
talk
brings
back
a
glimpse
of
my
own
past
life.
Twenty
five
years
ago
I
tried
to
persuade
a
beautiful
woman
to
love
me,
and
she
would
not.
I
had
not
the
key
to
her
nature;
she
was
a
stone
wall
to
me,
doorless
and
windowless."
"But
you
loved
her,
Yorke;
you
worshipped
Mary
Cave.
Your
conduct,
after
all,
was
that
of
a
man
never
of
a
fortune
hunter."
"Ay,
I
did
love
her;
but
then
she
was
beautiful
as
the
moon
we
do
not
see
to
night.
There
is
naught
like
her
in
these
days.
Miss
Helstone,
maybe,
has
a
look
of
her,
but
nobody
else."
"Who
has
a
look
