the
labour
of
persuading
the
stubborn,
the
constant
burden
and
task
of
training
the
best."
"But
with
love
it
need
not
be
so
very
difficult,"
interposed
Caroline.
"Mothers
love
their
children
most
dearly
almost
better
than
they
love
themselves."
"Fine
talk!
very
sentimental!
There
is
the
rough,
practical
part
of
life
yet
to
come
for
you,
young
miss."
"But,
Mrs.
Yorke,
if
I
take
a
little
baby
into
my
arms
any
poor
woman's
infant,
for
instance
I
feel
that
I
love
that
helpless
thing
quite
peculiarly,
though
I
am
not
its
mother.
I
could
do
almost
anything
for
it
willingly,
if
it
were
delivered
over
entirely
to
my
care
if
it
were
quite
dependent
on
me."
"You
feel!
Yes,
yes!
I
dare
say,
now.
You
are
led
a
great
deal
by
your
feelings,
and
you
think
yourself
a
very
sensitive
personage,
no
doubt.
Are
you
aware
that,
with
all
these
romantic
ideas,
you
have
managed
to
train
your
features
into
an
habitually
lackadaisical
expression,
better
suited
to
a
novel
heroine
than
to
a
woman
who
is
to
make
her
way
in
the
real
world
by
dint
of
common
sense?"
"No;
I
am
not
at
all
aware
of
that,
Mrs.
Yorke."
"Look
in
the
glass
just
behind
you.
Compare
the
face
you
see
there
with
that
of
any
early
rising,
hard
working
milkmaid."
"My
face
is
a
pale
one,
but
it
is
not
sentimental;
and
most
milkmaids,
however
red
and
robust
they
may
be,
are
more
stupid
and
less
practically
fitted
to
make
their
way
in
the
world
than
I
am.
I
think
more,
and
more
correctly,
than
milkmaids
in
general
do;
consequently,
where
they
would
often,
for
want
of
reflection,
act
weakly,
I,
by
dint
of
reflection,
should
act
judiciously."
"Oh
no!
you
would
be
influenced
by
your
feelings;
you
would
be
guided
by
impulse."
"Of
course
I
should
often
be
influenced
by
my
feelings.
They
were
given
me
to
that
end.
Whom
my
feelings
teach
me
to
love
I
must
and
shall
love;
and
I
hope,
if
ever
I
have
a
husband
and
children,
my
feelings
will
induce
me
to
love
them.
I
hope,
in
that
case,
all
my
impulses
will
be
strong
in
compelling
me
to
love."
Caroline
had
a
pleasure
in
saying
this
with
emphasis;
she
had
a
pleasure
in
daring
to
say
it
in
Mrs.
Yorke's
presence.
She
did
not
care
what
unjust
sarcasm
might
be
hurled
at
her
in
reply.
She
flushed,
not
with
anger
but
excitement,
when
the
ungenial
matron
answered
coolly,
"Don't
waste
your
dramatic
effects.
That
was
well
said
it
was
quite
fine;
but
it
is
lost
on
two
women
an
old
wife
and
an
old
maid.
There
should
have
been
a
disengaged
gentleman
present.
Is
Mr.
Robert
nowhere
hid
behind
the
curtains,
do
you
think,
Miss
Moore?"
Hortense,
who
during
the
chief
part
of
the
conversation
had
been
in
the
kitchen
superintending
the
preparations
for
tea,
did
not
yet
quite
comprehend
the
drift
of
the
discourse.
She
answered,
with
a
puzzled
