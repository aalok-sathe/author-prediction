into
a
parlour.
Of
course,
as
was
to
be
expected
in
such
a
Gothic
old
barrack,
this
parlour
was
lined
with
oak:
fine,
dark,
glossy
panels
compassed
the
walls
gloomily
and
grandly.
Very
handsome,
reader,
these
shining
brown
panels
are,
very
mellow
in
colouring
and
tasteful
in
effect,
but
if
you
know
what
a
"spring
clean"
is
very
execrable
and
inhuman.
Whoever,
having
the
bowels
of
humanity,
has
seen
servants
scrubbing
at
these
polished
wooden
walls
with
beeswaxed
cloths
on
a
warm
May
day
must
allow
that
they
are
"intolerable
and
not
to
be
endured;"
and
I
cannot
but
secretly
applaud
the
benevolent
barbarian
who
had
painted
another
and
larger
apartment
of
Fieldhead
the
drawing
room,
to
wit,
formerly
also
an
oak
room
of
a
delicate
pinky
white,
thereby
earning
for
himself
the
character
of
a
Hun,
but
mightily
enhancing
the
cheerfulness
of
that
portion
of
his
abode,
and
saving
future
housemaids
a
world
of
toil.
The
brown
panelled
parlour
was
furnished
all
in
old
style,
and
with
real
old
furniture.
On
each
side
of
the
high
mantelpiece
stood
two
antique
chairs
of
oak,
solid
as
silvan
thrones,
and
in
one
of
these
sat
a
lady.
But
if
this
were
Miss
Keeldar,
she
must
have
come
of
age
at
least
some
twenty
years
ago.
She
was
of
matronly
form,
and
though
she
wore
no
cap,
and
possessed
hair
of
quite
an
undimmed
auburn,
shading
small
and
naturally
young
looking
features,
she
had
no
youthful
aspect,
nor
apparently
the
wish
to
assume
it.
You
could
have
wished
her
attire
of
a
newer
fashion.
In
a
well
cut,
well
made
gown
hers
would
have
been
no
uncomely
presence.
It
puzzled
you
to
guess
why
a
garment
of
handsome
materials
should
be
arranged
in
such
scanty
folds,
and
devised
after
such
an
obsolete
mode.
You
felt
disposed
to
set
down
the
wearer
as
somewhat
eccentric
at
once.
This
lady
received
the
visitors
with
a
mixture
of
ceremony
and
diffidence
quite
English.
No
middle
aged
matron
who
was
not
an
Englishwoman
could
evince
precisely
the
same
manner
a
manner
so
uncertain
of
herself,
of
her
own
merits,
of
her
power
to
please,
and
yet
so
anxious
to
be
proper,
and,
if
possible,
rather
agreeable
than
otherwise.
In
the
present
instance,
however,
more
embarrassment
was
shown
than
is
usual
even
with
diffident
Englishwomen.
Miss
Helstone
felt
this,
sympathized
with
the
stranger,
and
knowing
by
experience
what
was
good
for
the
timid,
took
a
seat
quietly
near
her,
and
began
to
talk
to
her
with
a
gentle
ease,
communicated
for
the
moment
by
the
presence
of
one
less
self
possessed
than
herself.
She
and
this
lady
would,
if
alone,
have
at
once
got
on
extremely
well
together.
The
lady
had
the
clearest
voice
imaginable
infinitely
softer
and
more
tuneful
than
could
have
been
reasonably
expected
from
forty
years
and
a
form
decidedly
inclined
to
embonpoint.
This
voice
Caroline
liked;
it
atoned
for
the
formal,
if
correct,
accent
and
language.
The
lady
would
soon
have
discovered
she
