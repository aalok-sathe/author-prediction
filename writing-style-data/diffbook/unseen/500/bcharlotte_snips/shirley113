a
family,
like
me,
I
should
think
your
case
pretty
nigh
desperate;
but
the
young
and
unencumbered
have
chances
peculiar
to
themselves.
I
hear
gossip
now
and
then
about
your
being
on
the
eve
of
marriage
with
this
miss
and
that;
but
I
suppose
it
is
none
of
it
true?"
"You
may
well
suppose
that.
I
think
I
am
not
in
a
position
to
be
dreaming
of
marriage.
Marriage!
I
cannot
bear
the
word;
it
sounds
so
silly
and
utopian.
I
have
settled
it
decidedly
that
marriage
and
love
are
superfluities,
intended
only
for
the
rich,
who
live
at
ease,
and
have
no
need
to
take
thought
for
the
morrow;
or
desperations
the
last
and
reckless
joy
of
the
deeply
wretched,
who
never
hope
to
rise
out
of
the
slough
of
their
utter
poverty."
"I
should
not
think
so
if
I
were
circumstanced
as
you
are.
I
should
think
I
could
very
likely
get
a
wife
with
a
few
thousands,
who
would
suit
both
me
and
my
affairs."
"I
wonder
where?"
"Would
you
try
if
you
had
a
chance?"
"I
don't
know.
It
depends
on
in
short,
it
depends
on
many
things."
"Would
you
take
an
old
woman?"
"I'd
rather
break
stones
on
the
road."
"So
would
I.
Would
you
take
an
ugly
one?"
"Bah!
I
hate
ugliness
and
delight
in
beauty.
My
eyes
and
heart,
Yorke,
take
pleasure
in
a
sweet,
young,
fair
face,
as
they
are
repelled
by
a
grim,
rugged,
meagre
one.
Soft
delicate
lines
and
hues
please,
harsh
ones
prejudice
me.
I
won't
have
an
ugly
wife."
"Not
if
she
were
rich?"
"Not
if
she
were
dressed
in
gems.
I
could
not
love
I
could
not
fancy
I
could
not
endure
her.
My
taste
must
have
satisfaction,
or
disgust
would
break
out
in
despotism,
or
worse
freeze
to
utter
iciness."
"What!
Bob,
if
you
married
an
honest,
good
natured,
and
wealthy
lass,
though
a
little
hard
favoured,
couldn't
you
put
up
with
the
high
cheek
bones,
the
rather
wide
mouth,
and
reddish
hair?"
"I'll
never
try,
I
tell
you.
Grace
at
least
I
will
have,
and
youth
and
symmetry
yes,
and
what
I
call
beauty."
"And
poverty,
and
a
nursery
full
of
bairns
you
can
neither
clothe
nor
feed,
and
very
soon
an
anxious,
faded
mother;
and
then
bankruptcy,
discredit
a
life
long
struggle."
"Let
me
alone,
Yorke."
"If
you
are
romantic,
Robert,
and
especially
if
you
are
already
in
love,
it
is
of
no
use
talking."
"I
am
not
romantic.
I
am
stripped
of
romance
as
bare
as
the
white
tenters
in
that
field
are
of
cloth."
"Always
use
such
figures
of
speech,
lad;
I
can
understand
them.
And
there
is
no
love
affair
to
disturb
your
judgment?"
"I
thought
I
had
said
enough
on
that
subject
before.
Love
for
me?
Stuff!"
"Well,
then,
if
you
are
sound
both
in
heart
and
head,
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
profit
by
a
good
chance
if
it
offers;
therefore,
wait
and
see."
"You
are
