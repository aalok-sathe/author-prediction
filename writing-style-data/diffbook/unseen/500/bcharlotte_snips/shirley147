"I
choose
to
doubt
their
truth."
"I
am
afraid
that
proves
you
are
already
caught."
"Not
I.
But
if
I
were,
do
you
know
what
soothsayers
I
would
consult?"
"Let
me
hear."
"Neither
man
nor
woman,
elderly
nor
young:
the
little
Irish
beggar
that
comes
barefoot
to
my
door;
the
mouse
that
steals
out
of
the
cranny
in
the
wainscot;
the
bird
that
in
frost
and
snow
pecks
at
my
window
for
a
crumb;
the
dog
that
licks
my
hand
and
sits
beside
my
knee."
"Did
you
ever
see
any
one
who
was
kind
to
such
things?"
"Did
you
ever
see
any
one
whom
such
things
seemed
instinctively
to
follow,
like,
rely
on?"
"We
have
a
black
cat
and
an
old
dog
at
the
rectory.
I
know
somebody
to
whose
knee
that
black
cat
loves
to
climb,
against
whose
shoulder
and
cheek
it
likes
to
purr.
The
old
dog
always
comes
out
of
his
kennel
and
wags
his
tail,
and
whines
affectionately
when
somebody
passes."
"And
what
does
that
somebody
do?"
"He
quietly
strokes
the
cat,
and
lets
her
sit
while
he
conveniently
can;
and
when
he
must
disturb
her
by
rising,
he
puts
her
softly
down,
and
never
flings
her
from
him
roughly.
He
always
whistles
to
the
dog
and
gives
him
a
caress."
"Does
he?
It
is
not
Robert?"
"But
it
is
Robert."
"Handsome
fellow!"
said
Shirley,
with
enthusiasm.
Her
eyes
sparkled.
"Is
he
not
handsome?
Has
he
not
fine
eyes
and
well
cut
features,
and
a
clear,
princely
forehead?"
"He
has
all
that,
Caroline.
Bless
him!
he
is
both
graceful
and
good."
"I
was
sure
you
would
see
that
he
was.
When
I
first
looked
at
your
face
I
knew
you
would."
"I
was
well
inclined
to
him
before
I
saw
him.
I
liked
him
when
I
did
see
him.
I
admire
him
now.
There
is
charm
in
beauty
for
itself,
Caroline;
when
it
is
blent
with
goodness,
there
is
a
powerful
charm."
"When
mind
is
added,
Shirley?"
"Who
can
resist
it?"
"Remember
my
uncle,
Mesdames
Pryor,
Yorke,
and
Mann."
"Remember
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
of
Egypt.
He
is
a
noble
being.
I
tell
you
when
they
are
good
they
are
the
lords
of
the
creation
they
are
the
sons
of
God.
Moulded
in
their
Maker's
image,
the
minutest
spark
of
His
spirit
lifts
them
almost
above
mortality.
Indisputably,
a
great,
good,
handsome
man
is
the
first
of
created
things."
"Above
us?"
"I
would
scorn
to
contend
for
empire
with
him
I
would
scorn
it.
Shall
my
left
hand
dispute
for
precedence
with
my
right?
Shall
my
heart
quarrel
with
my
pulse?
Shall
my
veins
be
jealous
of
the
blood
which
fills
them?"
"Men
and
women,
husbands
and
wives,
quarrel
horribly,
Shirley."
"Poor
things!
Poor,
fallen,
degenerate
things!
God
made
them
for
another
lot,
for
other
feelings."
"But
are
we
men's
equals,
or
are
we
not?"
"Nothing
ever
charms
me
more
than
when
I
meet
my
superior
one
who
makes
me
sincerely
feel
that
he
is
