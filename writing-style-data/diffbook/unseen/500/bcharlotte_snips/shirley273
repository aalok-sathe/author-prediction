seemed
to
open
with
such
promise
such
foreboding
of
a
most
strange
tale
to
be
unfolded."
"And
in
reading
it
you
feel
as
if
you
were
far
away
from
England
really
in
Italy
under
another
sort
of
sky
that
blue
sky
of
the
south
which
travellers
describe."
"You
are
sensible
of
that,
Rose?"
"It
makes
me
long
to
travel,
Miss
Helstone."
"When
you
are
a
woman,
perhaps,
you
may
be
able
to
gratify
your
wish."
"I
mean
to
make
a
way
to
do
so,
if
one
is
not
made
for
me.
I
cannot
live
always
in
Briarfield.
The
whole
world
is
not
very
large
compared
with
creation.
I
must
see
the
outside
of
our
own
round
planet,
at
least."
"How
much
of
its
outside?"
"First
this
hemisphere
where
we
live;
then
the
other.
I
am
resolved
that
my
life
shall
be
a
life.
Not
a
black
trance
like
the
toad's,
buried
in
marble;
nor
a
long,
slow
death
like
yours
in
Briarfield
rectory."
"Like
mine!
what
can
you
mean,
child?"
"Might
you
not
as
well
be
tediously
dying
as
for
ever
shut
up
in
that
glebe
house
a
place
that,
when
I
pass
it,
always
reminds
me
of
a
windowed
grave?
I
never
see
any
movement
about
the
door.
I
never
hear
a
sound
from
the
wall.
I
believe
smoke
never
issues
from
the
chimneys.
What
do
you
do
there?"
"I
sew,
I
read,
I
learn
lessons."
"Are
you
happy?"
"Should
I
be
happy
wandering
alone
in
strange
countries
as
you
wish
to
do?"
"Much
happier,
even
if
you
did
nothing
but
wander.
Remember,
however,
that
I
shall
have
an
object
in
view;
but
if
you
only
went
on
and
on,
like
some
enchanted
lady
in
a
fairy
tale,
you
might
be
happier
than
now.
In
a
day's
wandering
you
would
pass
many
a
hill,
wood,
and
watercourse,
each
perpetually
altering
in
aspect
as
the
sun
shone
out
or
was
overcast;
as
the
weather
was
wet
or
fair,
dark
or
bright.
Nothing
changes
in
Briarfield
rectory.
The
plaster
of
the
parlour
ceilings,
the
paper
on
the
walls,
the
curtains,
carpets,
chairs,
are
still
the
same."
"Is
change
necessary
to
happiness?"
"Yes."
"Is
it
synonymous
with
it?"
"I
don't
know;
but
I
feel
monotony
and
death
to
be
almost
the
same."
Here
Jessie
spoke.
"Isn't
she
mad?"
she
asked.
"But,
Rose,"
pursued
Caroline,
"I
fear
a
wanderer's
life,
for
me
at
least,
would
end
like
that
tale
you
are
reading
in
disappointment,
vanity,
and
vexation
of
spirit."
"Does
'The
Italian'
so
end?"
"I
thought
so
when
I
read
it."
"Better
to
try
all
things
and
find
all
empty
than
to
try
nothing
and
leave
your
life
a
blank.
To
do
this
is
to
commit
the
sin
of
him
who
buried
his
talent
in
a
napkin
despicable
sluggard!"
"Rose,"
observed
Mrs.
Yorke,
"solid
satisfaction
is
only
to
be
realized
by
doing
one's
duty."
"Right,
mother!
And
if
my
Master
has
given
me
ten
talents,
my
duty
is
to
trade
with
them,
and
