disregarded
the
invitation,
and
coolly
settled
himself
on
his
haunches
at
Louis
Moore's
side.
That
gentleman
drew
the
dog's
big,
black
muzzled
head
on
to
his
knee,
patted
him,
and
smiled
one
little
smile
to
himself.
An
acute
observer
might
have
remarked,
in
the
course
of
the
same
evening,
that
after
Tartar
had
resumed
his
allegiance
to
Shirley,
and
was
once
more
couched
near
her
footstool,
the
audacious
tutor
by
one
word
and
gesture
fascinated
him
again.
He
pricked
up
his
ears
at
the
word;
he
started
erect
at
the
gesture,
and
came,
with
head
lovingly
depressed,
to
receive
the
expected
caress.
As
it
was
given,
the
significant
smile
again
rippled
across
Moore's
quiet
face.
"Shirley,"
said
Caroline
one
day,
as
they
two
were
sitting
alone
in
the
summer
house,
"did
you
know
that
my
cousin
Louis
was
tutor
in
your
uncle's
family
before
the
Sympsons
came
down
here?"
Shirley's
reply
was
not
so
prompt
as
her
responses
usually
were,
but
at
last
she
answered,
"Yes
of
course;
I
knew
it
well."
"I
thought
you
must
have
been
aware
of
the
circumstance."
"Well!
what
then?"
"It
puzzles
me
to
guess
how
it
chanced
that
you
never
mentioned
it
to
me."
"Why
should
it
puzzle
you?"
"It
seems
odd.
I
cannot
account
for
it.
You
talk
a
great
deal
you
talk
freely.
How
was
that
circumstance
never
touched
on?"
"Because
it
never
was,"
and
Shirley
laughed.
"You
are
a
singular
being!"
observed
her
friend.
"I
thought
I
knew
you
quite
well;
I
begin
to
find
myself
mistaken.
You
were
silent
as
the
grave
about
Mrs.
Pryor,
and
now
again
here
is
another
secret.
But
why
you
made
it
a
secret
is
the
mystery
to
me."
"I
never
made
it
a
secret;
I
had
no
reason
for
so
doing.
If
you
had
asked
me
who
Henry's
tutor
was,
I
would
have
told
you.
Besides,
I
thought
you
knew."
"I
am
puzzled
about
more
things
than
one
in
this
matter.
You
don't
like
poor
Louis.
Why?
Are
you
impatient
at
what
you
perhaps
consider
his
servile
position?
Do
you
wish
that
Robert's
brother
were
more
highly
placed?"
"Robert's
brother,
indeed!"
was
the
exclamation,
uttered
in
a
tone
like
the
accents
of
scorn;
and
with
a
movement
of
proud
impatience
Shirley
snatched
a
rose
from
a
branch
peeping
through
the
open
lattice.
"Yes,"
repeated
Caroline,
with
mild
firmness,
"Robert's
brother.
He
is
thus
closely
related
to
Gerard
Moore
of
the
Hollow,
though
nature
has
not
given
him
features
so
handsome
or
an
air
so
noble
as
his
kinsman;
but
his
blood
is
as
good,
and
he
is
as
much
a
gentleman
were
he
free."
"Wise,
humble,
pious
Caroline!"
exclaimed
Shirley
ironically.
"Men
and
angels,
hear
her!
We
should
not
despise
plain
features,
nor
a
laborious
yet
honest
occupation,
should
we?
Look
at
the
subject
of
your
panegyric.
He
is
there
in
the
garden,"
she
continued,
pointing
through
an
aperture
in
the
clustering
creepers;
and
by
that
aperture
Louis
Moore
was
visible,
coming
slowly
down
