matted
hall,
lined
almost
to
the
ceiling
with
pictures.
Through
this
they
were
conducted
to
a
large
parlour,
with
a
magnificent
fire
in
the
grate
the
most
cheerful
of
rooms
it
appeared
as
a
whole,
and
when
you
came
to
examine
details,
the
enlivening
effect
was
not
diminished.
There
was
no
splendour,
but
there
was
taste
everywhere,
unusual
taste
the
taste,
you
would
have
said,
of
a
travelled
man,
a
scholar,
and
a
gentleman.
A
series
of
Italian
views
decked
the
walls.
Each
of
these
was
a
specimen
of
true
art.
A
connoisseur
had
selected
them;
they
were
genuine
and
valuable.
Even
by
candle
light
the
bright
clear
skies,
the
soft
distances,
with
blue
air
quivering
between
the
eye
and
the
hills,
the
fresh
tints,
and
well
massed
lights
and
shadows,
charmed
the
view.
The
subjects
were
all
pastoral,
the
scenes
were
all
sunny.
There
was
a
guitar
and
some
music
on
a
sofa;
there
were
cameos,
beautiful
miniatures;
a
set
of
Grecian
looking
vases
on
the
mantelpiece;
there
were
books
well
arranged
in
two
elegant
bookcases.
Mr.
Yorke
bade
his
guests
be
seated.
He
then
rang
for
wine.
To
the
servant
who
brought
it
he
gave
hospitable
orders
for
the
refreshment
of
the
men
in
the
kitchen.
The
rector
remained
standing;
he
seemed
not
to
like
his
quarters;
he
would
not
touch
the
wine
his
host
offered
him.
"E'en
as
you
will,"
remarked
Mr.
Yorke.
"I
reckon
you're
thinking
of
Eastern
customs,
Mr.
Helstone,
and
you'll
not
eat
nor
drink
under
my
roof,
feared
we
suld
be
forced
to
be
friends;
but
I
am
not
so
particular
or
superstitious.
You
might
sup
the
contents
of
that
decanter,
and
you
might
give
me
a
bottle
of
the
best
in
your
own
cellar,
and
I'd
hold
myself
free
to
oppose
you
at
every
turn
still
in
every
vestry
meeting
and
justice
meeting
where
we
encountered
one
another."
"It
is
just
what
I
should
expect
of
you,
Mr.
Yorke."
"Does
it
agree
wi'
ye
now,
Mr.
Helstone,
to
be
riding
out
after
rioters,
of
a
wet
night,
at
your
age?"
"It
always
agrees
with
me
to
be
doing
my
duty;
and
in
this
case
my
duty
is
a
thorough
pleasure.
To
hunt
down
vermin
is
a
noble
occupation,
fit
for
an
archbishop."
"Fit
for
ye,
at
ony
rate.
But
where's
t'
curate?
He's
happen
gone
to
visit
some
poor
body
in
a
sick
gird,
or
he's
happen
hunting
down
vermin
in
another
direction."
"He
is
doing
garrison
duty
at
Hollow's
Mill."
"You
left
him
a
sup
o'
wine,
I
hope,
Bob"
(turning
to
Mr.
Moore),
"to
keep
his
courage
up?"
He
did
not
pause
for
an
answer,
but
continued,
quickly,
still
addressing
Moore,
who
had
thrown
himself
into
an
old
fashioned
chair
by
the
fireside
"Move
it,
Robert!
Get
up,
my
lad!
That
place
is
mine.
Take
the
sofa,
or
three
other
chairs,
if
you
will,
but
not
this.
It
belangs
to
me,
and
nob'dy
else."
"Why
are
you
so
particular
to
