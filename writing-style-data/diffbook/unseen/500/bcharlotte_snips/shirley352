inequality,
what
vantage
would
she
offer
the
foot?
It
is
the
natural
hill,
with
its
mossy
breaks
and
hollows,
whose
slope
invites
ascent,
whose
summit
it
is
pleasure
to
gain.
"To
leave
metaphor.
It
delights
my
eye
to
look
on
her.
She
suits
me.
If
I
were
a
king
and
she
the
housemaid
that
swept
my
palace
stairs,
across
all
that
space
between
us
my
eye
would
recognize
her
qualities;
a
true
pulse
would
beat
for
her
in
my
heart,
though
an
unspanned
gulf
made
acquaintance
impossible.
If
I
were
a
gentleman,
and
she
waited
on
me
as
a
servant,
I
could
not
help
liking
that
Shirley.
Take
from
her
her
education;
take
her
ornaments,
her
sumptuous
dress,
all
extrinsic
advantages;
take
all
grace,
but
such
as
the
symmetry
of
her
form
renders
inevitable;
present
her
to
me
at
a
cottage
door,
in
a
stuff
gown;
let
her
offer
me
there
a
draught
of
water,
with
that
smile,
with
that
warm
good
will
with
which
she
now
dispenses
manorial
hospitality
I
should
like
her.
I
should
wish
to
stay
an
hour;
I
should
linger
to
talk
with
that
rustic.
I
should
not
feel
as
I
now
do;
I
should
find
in
her
nothing
divine;
but
whenever
I
met
the
young
peasant,
it
would
be
with
pleasure;
whenever
I
left
her,
it
would
be
with
regret.
"How
culpably
careless
in
her
to
leave
her
desk
open,
where
I
know
she
has
money!
In
the
lock
hang
the
keys
of
all
her
repositories,
of
her
very
jewel
casket.
There
is
a
purse
in
that
little
satin
bag;
I
see
the
tassel
of
silver
beads
hanging
out.
That
spectacle
would
provoke
my
brother
Robert.
All
her
little
failings
would,
I
know,
be
a
source
of
irritation
to
him.
If
they
vex
me
it
is
a
most
pleasurable
vexation.
I
delight
to
find
her
at
fault;
and
were
I
always
resident
with
her,
I
am
aware
she
would
be
no
niggard
in
thus
ministering
to
my
enjoyment.
She
would
just
give
me
something
to
do,
to
rectify
a
theme
for
my
tutor
lectures.
I
never
lecture
Henry,
never
feel
disposed
to
do
so.
If
he
does
wrong
and
that
is
very
seldom,
dear,
excellent
lad!
a
word
suffices.
Often
I
do
no
more
than
shake
my
head.
But
the
moment
her
minois
mutin
meets
my
eye,
expostulatory
words
crowd
to
my
lips.
From
a
taciturn
man
I
believe
she
would
transform
me
into
a
talker.
Whence
comes
the
delight
I
take
in
that
talk?
It
puzzles
myself
sometimes.
The
more
crane,
malin,
taquin
is
her
mood,
consequently
the
clearer
occasion
she
gives
me
for
disapprobation,
the
more
I
seek
her,
the
better
I
like
her.
She
is
never
wilder
than
when
equipped
in
her
habit
and
hat,
never
less
manageable
than
when
she
and
Zoe
come
in
fiery
from
a
race
with
the
wind
on
the
hills;
and
I
confess
it
to
this
mute
page
I
may
confess
it
I
have
waited
an
hour
