sweepingly
the
widespread
spirit
of
disaffection
against
constituted
authorities,
the
growing
indisposition
to
bear
with
patience
evils
he
regarded
as
inevitable.
The
cures
he
prescribed
were
vigorous
government
interference,
strict
magisterial
vigilance;
when
necessary,
prompt
military
coercion.
Mr.
Yorke
wished
to
know
whether
this
interference,
vigilance,
and
coercion
would
feed
those
who
were
hungry,
give
work
to
those
who
wanted
work,
and
whom
no
man
would
hire.
He
scouted
the
idea
of
inevitable
evils.
He
said
public
patience
was
a
camel,
on
whose
back
the
last
atom
that
could
be
borne
had
already
been
laid,
and
that
resistance
was
now
a
duty;
the
widespread
spirit
of
disaffection
against
constituted
authorities
he
regarded
as
the
most
promising
sign
of
the
times;
the
masters,
he
allowed,
were
truly
aggrieved,
but
their
main
grievances
had
been
heaped
on
them
by
a
"corrupt,
base,
and
bloody"
government
(these
were
Mr.
Yorke's
epithets).
Madmen
like
Pitt,
demons
like
Castlereagh,
mischievous
idiots
like
Perceval,
were
the
tyrants,
the
curses
of
the
country,
the
destroyers
of
her
trade.
It
was
their
infatuated
perseverance
in
an
unjustifiable,
a
hopeless,
a
ruinous
war,
which
had
brought
the
nation
to
its
present
pass.
It
was
their
monstrously
oppressive
taxation,
it
was
the
infamous
"Orders
in
Council"
the
originators
of
which
deserved
impeachment
and
the
scaffold,
if
ever
public
men
did
that
hung
a
millstone
about
England's
neck.
"But
where
was
the
use
of
talking?"
he
demanded.
"What
chance
was
there
of
reason
being
heard
in
a
land
that
was
king
ridden,
priest
ridden,
peer
ridden;
where
a
lunatic
was
the
nominal
monarch,
an
unprincipled
debauchee
the
real
ruler;
where
such
an
insult
to
common
sense
as
hereditary
legislators
was
tolerated;
where
such
a
humbug
as
a
bench
of
bishops,
such
an
arrogant
abuse
as
a
pampered,
persecuting
established
church
was
endured
and
venerated;
where
a
standing
army
was
maintained,
and
a
host
of
lazy
parsons
and
their
pauper
families
were
kept
on
the
fat
of
the
land?"
Mr.
Helstone,
rising
up
and
putting
on
his
shovel
hat,
observed
in
reply,
"that
in
the
course
of
his
life
he
had
met
with
two
or
three
instances
where
sentiments
of
this
sort
had
been
very
bravely
maintained
so
long
as
health,
strength,
and
worldly
prosperity
had
been
the
allies
of
him
who
professed
them;
but
there
came
a
time,"
he
said,
"to
all
men,
'when
the
keepers
of
the
house
should
tremble;
when
they
should
be
afraid
of
that
which
is
high,
and
fear
should
be
in
the
way;'
and
that
time
was
the
test
of
the
advocate
of
anarchy
and
rebellion,
the
enemy
of
religion
and
order.
Ere
now,"
he
affirmed,
"he
had
been
called
upon
to
read
those
prayers
our
church
has
provided
for
the
sick
by
the
miserable
dying
bed
of
one
of
her
most
rancorous
foes;
he
had
seen
such
a
one
stricken
with
remorse,
solicitous
to
discover
a
place
for
repentance,
and
unable
to
find
any,
though
he
sought
it
carefully
with
tears.
He
must
forewarn
Mr.
