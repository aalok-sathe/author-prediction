will
gabble
when
the
curates
come
in,
and
how
weary
I
shall
grow
with
listening
to
them!
But
I
suppose
I
am
a
selfish
fool.
These
are
very
respectable
gentlefolks.
I
ought,
no
doubt,
to
be
proud
of
their
countenance.
I
don't
say
they
are
not
as
good
as
I
am
far
from
it
but
they
are
different
from
me."
She
went
in.
Yorkshire
people
in
those
days
took
their
tea
round
the
table,
sitting
well
into
it,
with
their
knees
duly
introduced
under
the
mahogany.
It
was
essential
to
have
a
multitude
of
plates
of
bread
and
butter,
varied
in
sorts
and
plentiful
in
quantity.
It
was
thought
proper,
too,
that
on
the
centre
plate
should
stand
a
glass
dish
of
marmalade.
Among
the
viands
was
expected
to
be
found
a
small
assortment
of
cheesecakes
and
tarts.
If
there
was
also
a
plate
of
thin
slices
of
pink
ham
garnished
with
green
parsley,
so
much
the
better.
Eliza,
the
rector's
cook,
fortunately
knew
her
business
as
provider.
She
had
been
put
out
of
humour
a
little
at
first,
when
the
invaders
came
so
unexpectedly
in
such
strength;
but
it
appeared
that
she
regained
her
cheerfulness
with
action,
for
in
due
time
the
tea
was
spread
forth
in
handsome
style,
and
neither
ham,
tarts,
nor
marmalade
were
wanting
among
its
accompaniments.
The
curates,
summoned
to
this
bounteous
repast,
entered
joyous;
but
at
once,
on
seeing
the
ladies,
of
whose
presence
they
had
not
been
forewarned,
they
came
to
a
stand
in
the
doorway.
Malone
headed
the
party;
he
stopped
short
and
fell
back,
almost
capsizing
Donne,
who
was
behind
him.
Donne,
staggering
three
paces
in
retreat,
sent
little
Sweeting
into
the
arms
of
old
Helstone,
who
brought
up
the
rear.
There
was
some
expostulation,
some
tittering.
Malone
was
desired
to
mind
what
he
was
about,
and
urged
to
push
forward,
which
at
last
he
did,
though
colouring
to
the
top
of
his
peaked
forehead
a
bluish
purple.
Helstone,
advancing,
set
the
shy
curates
aside,
welcomed
all
his
fair
guests,
shook
hands
and
passed
a
jest
with
each,
and
seated
himself
snugly
between
the
lovely
Harriet
and
the
dashing
Hannah.
Miss
Mary
he
requested
to
move
to
the
seat
opposite
to
him,
that
he
might
see
her
if
he
couldn't
be
near
her.
Perfectly
easy
and
gallant,
in
his
way,
were
his
manners
always
to
young
ladies,
and
most
popular
was
he
amongst
them;
yet
at
heart
he
neither
respected
nor
liked
the
sex,
and
such
of
them
as
circumstances
had
brought
into
intimate
relation
with
him
had
ever
feared
rather
than
loved
him.
The
curates
were
left
to
shift
for
themselves.
Sweeting,
who
was
the
least
embarrassed
of
the
three,
took
refuge
beside
Mrs.
Sykes,
who,
he
knew,
was
almost
as
fond
of
him
as
if
he
had
been
her
son.
Donne,
after
making
his
general
bow
with
a
grace
all
his
own,
and
saying
in
a
high,
pragmatical
voice,
"How
d'ye
do,
Miss
Helstone?"
dropped
into
a
seat
at
