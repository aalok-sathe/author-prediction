a
scutter
a
run
a
positive
tumult.
"O
Malone,
Malone!"
"Down!
down!
down!"
cried
the
high
voice.
"He
really
is
worrying
them!"
exclaimed
Shirley.
"They
have
struck
him.
A
blow
is
what
he
is
not
used
to,
and
will
not
take."
Out
she
ran.
A
gentleman
was
fleeing
up
the
oak
staircase,
making
for
refuge
in
the
gallery
or
chambers
in
hot
haste;
another
was
backing
fast
to
the
stairfoot,
wildly
flourishing
a
knotty
stick,
at
the
same
time
reiterating,
"Down!
down!
down!"
while
the
tawny
dog
bayed,
bellowed,
howled
at
him,
and
a
group
of
servants
came
bundling
from
the
kitchen.
The
dog
made
a
spring;
the
second
gentleman
turned
tail
and
rushed
after
his
comrade.
The
first
was
already
safe
in
a
bedroom;
he
held
the
door
against
his
fellow
nothing
so
merciless
as
terror.
But
the
other
fugitive
struggled
hard;
the
door
was
about
to
yield
to
his
strength.
"Gentlemen,"
was
uttered
in
Miss
Keeldar's
silvery
but
vibrating
tones,
"spare
my
locks,
if
you
please.
Calm
yourselves!
Come
down!
Look
at
Tartar;
he
won't
harm
a
cat."
She
was
caressing
the
said
Tartar.
He
lay
crouched
at
her
feet,
his
fore
paws
stretched
out,
his
tail
still
in
threatening
agitation,
his
nostrils
snorting,
his
bulldog
eyes
conscious
of
a
dull
fire.
He
was
an
honest,
phlegmatic,
stupid,
but
stubborn
canine
character.
He
loved
his
mistress
and
John
the
man
who
fed
him
but
was
mostly
indifferent
to
the
rest
of
the
world.
Quiet
enough
he
was,
unless
struck
or
threatened
with
a
stick,
and
that
put
a
demon
into
him
at
once.
"Mr.
Malone,
how
do
you
do?"
continued
Shirley,
lifting
up
her
mirth
lit
face
to
the
gallery.
"That
is
not
the
way
to
the
oak
parlour;
that
is
Mrs.
Pryor's
apartment.
Request
your
friend
Mr.
Donne
to
evacuate.
I
shall
have
the
greatest
pleasure
in
receiving
him
in
a
lower
room."
"Ha!
ha!"
cried
Malone,
in
hollow
laughter,
quitting
the
door,
and
leaning
over
the
massive
balustrade.
"Really
that
animal
alarmed
Donne.
He
is
a
little
timid,"
he
proceeded,
stiffening
himself,
and
walking
trimly
to
the
stairhead.
"I
thought
it
better
to
follow,
in
order
to
reassure
him."
"It
appears
you
did.
Well,
come
down,
if
you
please.
John"
(turning
to
her
manservant),
"go
upstairs
and
liberate
Mr.
Donne.
Take
care,
Mr.
Malone;
the
stairs
are
slippery."
In
truth
they
were,
being
of
polished
oak.
The
caution
came
a
little
late
for
Malone.
He
had
slipped
already
in
his
stately
descent,
and
was
only
saved
from
falling
by
a
clutch
at
the
banisters,
which
made
the
whole
structure
creak
again.
Tartar
seemed
to
think
the
visitor's
descent
effected
with
unwarranted
eclat,
and
accordingly
he
growled
once
more.
Malone,
however,
was
no
coward.
The
spring
of
the
dog
had
taken
him
by
surprise,
but
he
passed
him
now
in
suppressed
fury
rather
than
fear.
If
a
look
could
have
strangled
Tartar,
he
would
have
breathed
no
more.
Forgetting
politeness
in
his
sullen
rage,
Malone
pushed
into
