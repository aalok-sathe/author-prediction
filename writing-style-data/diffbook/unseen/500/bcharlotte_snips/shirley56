in
a
spiritless
tone;
and
then
she
leaned
her
arm
and
head
against
the
kitchen
mantelpiece,
and
hung
listlessly
over
the
fire.
"How
low
you
seem,
miss!
But
it's
all
because
your
cousin
keeps
you
so
close
to
work.
It's
a
shame!"
"Nothing
of
the
kind,
Sarah,"
was
the
brief
reply.
"Oh!
but
I
know
it
is.
You're
fit
to
cry
just
this
minute,
for
nothing
else
but
because
you've
sat
still
the
whole
day.
It
would
make
a
kitten
dull
to
be
mewed
up
so."
"Sarah,
does
your
master
often
come
home
early
from
market
when
it
is
wet?"
"Never,
hardly;
but
just
to
day,
for
some
reason,
he
has
made
a
difference."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"He
is
come.
I
am
certain
I
saw
Murgatroyd
lead
his
horse
into
the
yard
by
the
back
way,
when
I
went
to
get
some
water
at
the
pump
five
minutes
since.
He
was
in
the
counting
house
with
Joe
Scott,
I
believe."
"You
are
mistaken."
"What
should
I
be
mistaken
for?
I
know
his
horse
surely?"
"But
you
did
not
see
himself?"
"I
heard
him
speak,
though.
He
was
saying
something
to
Joe
Scott
about
having
settled
all
concerning
ways
and
means,
and
that
there
would
be
a
new
set
of
frames
in
the
mill
before
another
week
passed,
and
that
this
time
he
would
get
four
soldiers
from
Stilbro'
barracks
to
guard
the
wagon."
"Sarah,
are
you
making
a
gown?"
"Yes.
Is
it
a
handsome
one?"
"Beautiful!
Get
the
coffee
ready.
I'll
finish
cutting
out
that
sleeve
for
you,
and
I'll
give
you
some
trimming
for
it.
I
have
some
narrow
satin
ribbon
of
a
colour
that
will
just
match
it."
"You're
very
kind,
miss."
"Be
quick;
there's
a
good
girl.
But
first
put
your
master's
shoes
on
the
hearth:
he
will
take
his
boots
off
when
he
comes
in.
I
hear
him;
he
is
coming."
"Miss,
you
are
cutting
the
stuff
wrong."
"So
I
am;
but
it
is
only
a
snip.
There
is
no
harm
done."
The
kitchen
door
opened;
Mr.
Moore
entered,
very
wet
and
cold.
Caroline
half
turned
from
her
dressmaking
occupation,
but
renewed
it
for
a
moment,
as
if
to
gain
a
minute's
time
for
some
purpose.
Bent
over
the
dress,
her
face
was
hidden;
there
was
an
attempt
to
settle
her
features
and
veil
their
expression,
which
failed.
When
she
at
last
met
Mr.
Moore,
her
countenance
beamed.
"We
had
ceased
to
expect
you.
They
asserted
you
would
not
come,"
she
said.
"But
I
promised
to
return
soon.
You
expected
me,
I
suppose?"
"No,
Robert;
I
dared
not
when
it
rained
so
fast.
And
you
are
wet
and
chilled.
Change
everything.
If
you
took
cold,
I
should
we
should
blame
ourselves
in
some
measure."
"I
am
not
wet
through:
my
riding
coat
is
waterproof.
Dry
shoes
are
all
I
require.
There
the
fire
is
pleasant
after
facing
the
cold
wind
and
rain
for
a
few
miles."
He
stood
on
the
kitchen
hearth;
Caroline
stood
beside
