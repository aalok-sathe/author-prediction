thinking
when
I
inquired
after
the
wounded.
What
damage
have
your
opponents
sustained?"
"One
of
the
rioters,
or
victims
as
you
call
them,
was
killed,
and
six
were
hurt."
"What
have
you
done
with
them?"
"What
you
will
perfectly
approve.
Medical
aid
was
procured
immediately;
and
as
soon
as
we
can
get
a
couple
of
covered
wagons
and
some
clean
straw,
they
will
be
removed
to
Stilbro'."
"Straw!
You
must
have
beds
and
bedding.
I
will
send
my
wagon
directly,
properly
furnished;
and
Mr.
Yorke,
I
am
sure,
will
send
his."
"You
guess
correctly;
he
has
volunteered
already.
And
Mrs.
Yorke
who,
like
you,
seems
disposed
to
regard
the
rioters
as
martyrs,
and
me,
and
especially
Mr.
Helstone,
as
murderers
is
at
this
moment,
I
believe,
most
assiduously
engaged
in
fitting
it
up
with
feather
beds,
pillows,
bolsters,
blankets,
etc.
The
victims
lack
no
attentions,
I
promise
you.
Mr.
Hall,
your
favourite
parson,
has
been
with
them
ever
since
six
o'clock,
exhorting
them,
praying
with
them,
and
even
waiting
on
them
like
any
nurse;
and
Caroline's
good
friend,
Miss
Ainley,
that
very
plain
old
maid,
sent
in
a
stock
of
lint
and
linen,
something
in
the
proportion
of
another
lady's
allowance
of
beef
and
wine."
"That
will
do.
Where
is
your
sister?"
"Well
cared
for.
I
had
her
securely
domiciled
with
Miss
Mann.
This
very
morning
the
two
set
out
for
Wormwood
Wells
[a
noted
watering
place],
and
will
stay
there
some
weeks."
"So
Mr.
Helstone
domiciled
me
at
the
rectory!
Mighty
clever
you
gentlemen
think
you
are!
I
make
you
heartily
welcome
to
the
idea,
and
hope
its
savour,
as
you
chew
the
cud
of
reflection
upon
it,
gives
you
pleasure.
Acute
and
astute,
why
are
you
not
also
omniscient?
How
is
it
that
events
transpire,
under
your
very
noses,
of
which
you
have
no
suspicion?
It
should
be
so,
otherwise
the
exquisite
gratification
of
outmanoeuvring
you
would
be
unknown.
Ah,
friend,
you
may
search
my
countenance,
but
you
cannot
read
it."
Moore,
indeed,
looked
as
if
he
could
not.
"You
think
me
a
dangerous
specimen
of
my
sex.
Don't
you
now?"
"A
peculiar
one,
at
least."
"But
Caroline
is
she
peculiar?"
"In
her
way
yes."
"Her
way!
What
is
her
way?"
"You
know
her
as
well
as
I
do."
"And
knowing
her,
I
assert
that
she
is
neither
eccentric
nor
difficult
of
control.
Is
she?"
"That
depends
"
"However,
there
is
nothing
masculine
about
her?"
"Why
lay
such
emphasis
on
her?
Do
you
consider
her
a
contrast,
in
that
respect,
to
yourself?"
"You
do,
no
doubt;
but
that
does
not
signify.
Caroline
is
neither
masculine,
nor
of
what
they
call
the
spirited
order
of
women."
"I
have
seen
her
flash
out."
"So
have
I,
but
not
with
manly
fire.
It
was
a
short,
vivid,
trembling
glow,
that
shot
up,
shone,
vanished
"
"And
left
her
scared
at
her
own
daring.
You
describe
others
besides
Caroline."
"The
point
I
wish
to
establish
is,
that
Miss
Helstone,
though
gentle,
tractable,
