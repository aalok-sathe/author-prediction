she
was
lifted
lightly
to
his
knee,
"and
he
is
married
now,
or
as
good.
He
promised
that
I
should
be
his
wife
last
summer,
the
first
time
he
saw
me
in
my
new
white
frock
and
blue
sash.
Didn't
he,
father?"
(These
children
were
not
accustomed
to
say
papa
and
mamma;
their
mother
would
allow
no
such
"namby
pamby.")
"Ay,
my
little
lassie,
he
promised;
I'll
bear
witness.
But
make
him
say
it
over
again
now,
Jessy.
Such
as
he
are
only
false
loons."
"He
is
not
false.
He
is
too
bonny
to
be
false,"
said
Jessy,
looking
up
to
her
tall
sweetheart
with
the
fullest
confidence
in
his
faith.
"Bonny!"
cried
Mr.
Yorke.
"That's
the
reason
that
he
should
be,
and
proof
that
he
is,
a
scoundrel."
"But
he
looks
too
sorrowful
to
be
false,"
here
interposed
a
quiet
voice
from
behind
the
father's
chair.
"If
he
was
always
laughing,
I
should
think
he
forgot
promises
soon,
but
Mr.
Moore
never
laughs."
"Your
sentimental
buck
is
the
greatest
cheat
of
all,
Rose,"
remarked
Mr.
Yorke.
"He's
not
sentimental,"
said
Rose.
Mr.
Moore
turned
to
her
with
a
little
surprise,
smiling
at
the
same
time.
"How
do
you
know
I
am
not
sentimental,
Rose?"
"Because
I
heard
a
lady
say
you
were
not."
"Voila,
qui
devient
interessant!"
exclaimed
Mr.
Yorke,
hitching
his
chair
nearer
the
fire.
"A
lady!
That
has
quite
a
romantic
twang.
We
must
guess
who
it
is.
Rosy,
whisper
the
name
low
to
your
father.
Don't
let
him
hear."
"Rose,
don't
be
too
forward
to
talk,"
here
interrupted
Mrs.
Yorke,
in
her
usual
kill
joy
fashion,
"nor
Jessy
either.
It
becomes
all
children,
especially
girls,
to
be
silent
in
the
presence
of
their
elders."
"Why
have
we
tongues,
then?"
asked
Jessy
pertly;
while
Rose
only
looked
at
her
mother
with
an
expression
that
seemed
to
say
she
should
take
that
maxim
in
and
think
it
over
at
her
leisure.
After
two
minutes'
grave
deliberation,
she
asked,
"And
why
especially
girls,
mother?"
"Firstly,
because
I
say
so;
and
secondly,
because
discretion
and
reserve
are
a
girl's
best
wisdom."
"My
dear
madam,"
observed
Moore,
"what
you
say
is
excellent
it
reminds
me,
indeed,
of
my
dear
sister's
observations;
but
really
it
is
not
applicable
to
these
little
ones.
Let
Rose
and
Jessy
talk
to
me
freely,
or
my
chief
pleasure
in
coming
here
is
gone.
I
like
their
prattle;
it
does
me
good."
"Does
it
not?"
asked
Jessy.
"More
good
than
if
the
rough
lads
came
round
you.
You
call
them
rough,
mother,
yourself."
"Yes,
mignonne,
a
thousand
times
more
good.
I
have
rough
lads
enough
about
me
all
day
long,
poulet."
"There
are
plenty
of
people,"
continued
she,
"who
take
notice
of
the
boys.
All
my
uncles
and
aunts
seem
to
think
their
nephews
better
than
their
nieces,
and
when
gentlemen
come
here
to
dine,
it
is
always
Matthew,
and
Mark,
and
Martin
that
are
talked
to,
and
never
Rose
and
me.
Mr.
Moore
is
our
friend,
