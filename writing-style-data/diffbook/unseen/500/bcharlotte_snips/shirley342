I
know
the
day.
I
noticed
the
change.
Your
pain
is
mental."
"Not
at
all.
It
is
nothing
so
dignified
merely
nervous.
Oh!
dismiss
the
topic."
"When
it
is
exhausted;
not
till
then.
Nervous
alarms
should
always
be
communicated,
that
they
may
be
dissipated.
I
wish
I
had
the
gift
of
persuasion,
and
could
incline
you
to
speak
willingly.
I
believe
confession,
in
your
case,
would
be
half
equivalent
to
cure."
"No,"
said
Shirley
abruptly.
"I
wish
that
were
at
all
probable;
but
I
am
afraid
it
is
not."
She
suspended
her
work
a
moment.
She
was
now
seated.
Resting
her
elbow
on
the
table,
she
leaned
her
head
on
her
hand.
Mr.
Moore
looked
as
if
he
felt
he
had
at
last
gained
some
footing
in
this
difficult
path.
She
was
serious,
and
in
her
wish
was
implied
an
important
admission;
after
that
she
could
no
longer
affirm
that
nothing
ailed
her.
The
tutor
allowed
her
some
minutes
for
repose
and
reflection
ere
he
returned
to
the
charge.
Once
his
lips
moved
to
speak,
but
he
thought
better
of
it,
and
prolonged
the
pause.
Shirley
lifted
her
eye
to
his.
Had
he
betrayed
injudicious
emotion,
perhaps
obstinate
persistence
in
silence
would
have
been
the
result;
but
he
looked
calm,
strong,
trustworthy.
"I
had
better
tell
you
than
my
aunt,"
she
said,
"or
than
my
cousins,
or
my
uncle.
They
would
all
make
such
a
bustle,
and
it
is
that
very
bustle
I
dread
the
alarm,
the
flurry,
the
eclat.
In
short,
I
never
liked
to
be
the
centre
of
a
small
domestic
whirlpool.
You
can
bear
a
little
shock
eh?"
"A
great
one,
if
necessary."
Not
a
muscle
of
the
man's
frame
moved,
and
yet
his
large
heart
beat
fast
in
his
deep
chest.
What
was
she
going
to
tell
him?
Was
irremediable
mischief
done?
"Had
I
thought
it
right
to
go
to
you,
I
would
never
have
made
a
secret
of
the
matter
one
moment,"
she
continued.
"I
would
have
told
you
at
once,
and
asked
advice."
"Why
was
it
not
right
to
come
to
me?"
"It
might
be
right
I
do
not
mean
that;
but
I
could
not
do
it.
I
seemed
to
have
no
title
to
trouble
you.
The
mishap
concerned
me
only.
I
wanted
to
keep
it
to
myself,
and
people
will
not
let
me.
I
tell
you,
I
hate
to
be
an
object
of
worrying
attention,
or
a
theme
for
village
gossip.
Besides,
it
may
pass
away
without
result
God
knows!"
Moore,
though
tortured
with
suspense,
did
not
demand
a
quick
explanation.
He
suffered
neither
gesture,
glance,
nor
word
to
betray
impatience.
His
tranquillity
tranquillized
Shirley;
his
confidence
reassured
her.
"Great
effects
may
spring
from
trivial
causes,"
she
remarked,
as
she
loosened
a
bracelet
from
her
wrist.
Then,
unfastening
her
sleeve,
and
partially
turning
it
up,
"Look
here,
Mr.
Moore."
She
showed
a
mark
in
her
white
arm
rather
a
deep
though
healed
up
indentation
something
between
a
burn
and
a
cut.
"I
would
