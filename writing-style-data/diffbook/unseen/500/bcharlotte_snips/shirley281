tying
it
over
her
black
apron,
rushed
eperdue
into
the
kitchen,
whence,
to
speak
truth,
exhaled
an
odour
of
calcined
sweets
rather
strong
than
savoury.
The
mistress
and
maid
had
been
in
full
feud
the
whole
day,
on
the
subject
of
preserving
certain
black
cherries,
hard
as
marbles,
sour
as
sloes.
Sarah
held
that
sugar
was
the
only
orthodox
condiment
to
be
used
in
that
process;
mademoiselle
maintained
and
proved
it
by
the
practice
and
experience
of
her
mother,
grandmother,
and
great
grandmother
that
treacle,
"melasse,"
was
infinitely
preferable.
She
had
committed
an
imprudence
in
leaving
Sarah
in
charge
of
the
preserving
pan,
for
her
want
of
sympathy
in
the
nature
of
its
contents
had
induced
a
degree
of
carelessness
in
watching
their
confection,
whereof
the
result
was
dark
and
cindery
ruin.
Hubbub
followed;
high
upbraiding,
and
sobs
rather
loud
than
deep
or
real.
Caroline,
once
more
turning
to
the
little
mirror,
was
shading
her
ringlets
from
her
cheek
to
smooth
them
under
her
cottage
bonnet,
certain
that
it
would
not
only
be
useless
but
unpleasant
to
stay
longer,
when,
on
the
sudden
opening
of
the
back
door,
there
fell
an
abrupt
calm
in
the
kitchen.
The
tongues
were
checked,
pulled
up
as
with
bit
and
bridle.
"Was
it
was
it
Robert?"
He
often
almost
always
entered
by
the
kitchen
way
on
his
return
from
market.
No;
it
was
only
Joe
Scott,
who,
having
hemmed
significantly
thrice
every
hem
being
meant
as
a
lofty
rebuke
to
the
squabbling
womankind
said,
"Now,
I
thowt
I
heerd
a
crack?"
None
answered.
"And,"
he
continued
pragmatically,
"as
t'
maister's
comed,
and
as
he'll
enter
through
this
hoyle,
I
considered
it
desirable
to
step
in
and
let
ye
know.
A
household
o'
women
is
nivver
fit
to
be
comed
on
wi'out
warning.
Here
he
is.
Walk
forrard,
sir.
They
war
playing
up
queerly,
but
I
think
I've
quietened
'em."
Another
person,
it
was
now
audible,
entered.
Joe
Scott
proceeded
with
his
rebukes.
"What
d'ye
mean
by
being
all
i'
darkness?
Sarah,
thou
quean,
canst
t'
not
light
a
candle?
It
war
sundown
an
hour
syne.
He'll
brak
his
shins
agean
some
o'
yer
pots,
and
tables,
and
stuff.
Tak
tent
o'
this
baking
bowl,
sir;
they've
set
it
i'
yer
way,
fair
as
if
they
did
it
i'
malice."
To
Joe's
observations
succeeded
a
confused
sort
of
pause,
which
Caroline,
though
she
was
listening
with
both
her
ears,
could
not
understand.
It
was
very
brief.
A
cry
broke
it
a
sound
of
surprise,
followed
by
the
sound
of
a
kiss;
ejaculations,
but
half
articulate,
succeeded.
"Mon
Dieu!
mon
Dieu!
Est
ce
que
je
m'y
attendais?"
were
the
words
chiefly
to
be
distinguished.
"Et
tu
te
portes
toujours
bien,
bonne
seaur?"
inquired
another
voice
Robert's,
certainly.
Caroline
was
puzzled.
Obeying
an
impulse
the
wisdom
of
which
she
had
not
time
to
question,
she
escaped
from
the
little
parlour,
by
way
of
leaving
the
coast
clear,
and
running
upstairs
took
up
a
position
at
the
head
