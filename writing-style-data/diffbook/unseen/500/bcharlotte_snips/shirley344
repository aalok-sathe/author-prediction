What
can
I
demand
better
in
this
world
than
to
be
of
use
to
you?"
"I
had
no
claim."
"Monstrous!
And
you
did
nothing?"
"Yes.
I
walked
straight
into
the
laundry,
where
they
are
ironing
most
of
the
week,
now
that
I
have
so
many
guests
in
the
house.
While
the
maid
was
busy
crimping
or
starching,
I
took
an
Italian
iron
from
the
fire,
and
applied
the
light
scarlet
glowing
tip
to
my
arm.
I
bored
it
well
in.
It
cauterized
the
little
wound.
Then
I
went
upstairs."
"I
dare
say
you
never
once
groaned?"
"I
am
sure
I
don't
know.
I
was
very
miserable
not
firm
or
tranquil
at
all,
I
think.
There
was
no
calm
in
my
mind."
"There
was
calm
in
your
person.
I
remember
listening
the
whole
time
we
sat
at
luncheon,
to
hear
if
you
moved
in
the
room
above.
All
was
quiet."
"I
was
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
bed,
wishing
Pheabe
had
not
bitten
me."
"And
alone.
You
like
solitude."
"Pardon
me."
"You
disdain
sympathy."
"Do
I,
Mr.
Moore?"
"With
your
powerful
mind
you
must
feel
independent
of
help,
of
advice,
of
society."
"So
be
it,
since
it
pleases
you."
She
smiled.
She
pursued
her
embroidery
carefully
and
quickly,
but
her
eyelash
twinkled,
and
then
it
glittered,
and
then
a
drop
fell.
Mr.
Moore
leaned
forward
on
his
desk,
moved
his
chair,
altered
his
attitude.
"If
it
is
not
so,"
he
asked,
with
a
peculiar,
mellow
change
in
his
voice,
"how
is
it,
then?"
"I
don't
know."
"You
do
know,
but
you
won't
speak.
All
must
be
locked
up
in
yourself."
"Because
it
is
not
worth
sharing."
"Because
nobody
can
give
the
high
price
you
require
for
your
confidence.
Nobody
is
rich
enough
to
purchase
it.
Nobody
has
the
honour,
the
intellect,
the
power
you
demand
in
your
adviser.
There
is
not
a
shoulder
in
England
on
which
you
would
rest
your
hand
for
support,
far
less
a
bosom
which
you
would
permit
to
pillow
your
head.
Of
course
you
must
live
alone."
"I
can
live
alone,
if
need
be.
But
the
question
is
not
how
to
live,
but
how
to
die
alone.
That
strikes
me
in
a
more
grisly
light."
"You
apprehend
the
effects
of
the
virus?
You
anticipate
an
indefinitely
threatening,
dreadful
doom?"
She
bowed.
"You
are
very
nervous
and
womanish."
"You
complimented
me
two
minutes
since
on
my
powerful
mind."
"You
are
very
womanish.
If
the
whole
affair
were
coolly
examined
and
discussed,
I
feel
assured
it
would
turn
out
that
there
is
no
danger
of
your
dying
at
all."
"Amen!
I
am
very
willing
to
live,
if
it
please
God.
I
have
felt
life
sweet."
"How
can
it
be
otherwise
than
sweet
with
your
endowments
and
nature?
Do
you
truly
expect
that
you
will
be
seized
with
hydrophobia,
and
die
raving
mad?"
"I
expect
it,
and
have
feared
it.
Just
now
I
fear
nothing."
"Nor
do
I,
on
your
account.
I
doubt
whether
the
smallest
particle
