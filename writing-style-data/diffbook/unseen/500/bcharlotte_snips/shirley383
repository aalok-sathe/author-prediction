before
nor
any
female,
save,
now
and
then,
a
village
girl
come
to
gather
nuts.
To
night
the
apparition
does
not
displease
him.
He
observes,
as
she
approaches,
that
she
is
neither
old
nor
plain,
but,
on
the
contrary,
very
youthful;
and,
but
that
he
now
recognizes
her
for
one
whom
he
has
often
wilfully
pronounced
ugly,
he
would
deem
that
he
discovered
traits
of
beauty
behind
the
thin
gauze
of
that
veil.
She
passes
him
and
says
nothing.
He
knew
she
would.
All
women
are
proud
monkeys,
and
he
knows
no
more
conceited
doll
than
that
Caroline
Helstone.
The
thought
is
hardly
hatched
in
his
mind
when
the
lady
retraces
those
two
steps
she
had
got
beyond
him,
and
raising
her
veil,
reposes
her
glance
on
his
face,
while
she
softly
asks,
"Are
you
one
of
Mr.
Yorke's
sons?"
No
human
evidence
would
ever
have
been
able
to
persuade
Martin
Yorke
that
he
blushed
when
thus
addressed;
yet
blush
he
did,
to
the
ears.
"I
am,"
he
said
bluntly,
and
encouraged
himself
to
wonder,
superciliously,
what
would
come
next.
"You
are
Martin,
I
think?"
was
the
observation
that
followed.
It
could
not
have
been
more
felicitous.
It
was
a
simple
sentence
very
artlessly,
a
little
timidly,
pronounced;
but
it
chimed
in
harmony
to
the
youth's
nature.
It
stilled
him
like
a
note
of
music.
Martin
had
a
keen
sense
of
his
personality;
he
felt
it
right
and
sensible
that
the
girl
should
discriminate
him
from
his
brothers.
Like
his
father,
he
hated
ceremony.
It
was
acceptable
to
hear
a
lady
address
him
as
"Martin,"
and
not
Mr.
Martin
or
Master
Martin,
which
form
would
have
lost
her
his
good
graces
for
ever.
Worse,
if
possible,
than
ceremony
was
the
other
extreme
of
slipshod
familiarity.
The
slight
tone
of
bashfulness,
the
scarcely
perceptible
hesitation,
was
considered
perfectly
in
place.
"I
am
Martin,"
he
said.
"Are
your
father
and
mother
well?"
(it
was
lucky
she
did
not
say
papa
and
mamma;
that
would
have
undone
all);
"and
Rose
and
Jessie?"
"I
suppose
so."
"My
cousin
Hortense
is
still
at
Briarmains?"
"Oh
yes."
Martin
gave
a
comic
half
smile
and
demi
groan.
The
half
smile
was
responded
to
by
the
lady,
who
could
guess
in
what
sort
of
odour
Hortense
was
likely
to
be
held
by
the
young
Yorkes.
"Does
your
mother
like
her?"
"They
suit
so
well
about
the
servants
they
can't
help
liking
each
other."
"It
is
cold
to
night."
"Why
are
you
out
so
late?"
"I
lost
my
way
in
this
wood."
Now,
indeed,
Martin
allowed
himself
a
refreshing
laugh
of
scorn.
"Lost
your
way
in
the
mighty
forest
of
Briarmains!
You
deserve
never
more
to
find
it."
"I
never
was
here
before,
and
I
believe
I
am
trespassing
now.
You
might
inform
against
me
if
you
chose,
Martin,
and
have
me
fined.
It
is
your
father's
wood."
"I
should
think
I
knew
that.
But
since
you
are
so
simple
as
to
lose
your
way,
I
will
guide
you
