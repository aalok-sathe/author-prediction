shape
that,
seen
in
a
moonbeam,
lived,
had
a
pulse,
had
movement,
wore
health's
glow
and
youth's
freshness,
turned
cold
and
ghostly
gray,
confronted
with
the
red
of
sunrise.
It
wasted.
She
was
left
solitary
at
last.
She
crept
to
her
couch,
chill
and
dejected.
"Of
course,
I
know
he
will
marry
Shirley,"
were
her
first
words
when
she
rose
in
the
morning.
"And
he
ought
to
marry
her.
She
can
help
him,"
she
added
firmly.
"But
I
shall
be
forgotten
when
they
are
married,"
was
the
cruel
succeeding
thought.
"Oh!
I
shall
be
wholly
forgotten!
And
what
what
shall
I
do
when
Robert
is
taken
quite
from
me?
Where
shall
I
turn?
My
Robert!
I
wish
I
could
justly
call
him
mine.
But
I
am
poverty
and
incapacity;
Shirley
is
wealth
and
power.
And
she
is
beauty
too,
and
love.
I
cannot
deny
it.
This
is
no
sordid
suit.
She
loves
him
not
with
inferior
feelings.
She
loves,
or
will
love,
as
he
must
feel
proud
to
be
loved.
Not
a
valid
objection
can
be
made.
Let
them
be
married,
then.
But
afterwards
I
shall
be
nothing
to
him.
As
for
being
his
sister,
and
all
that
stuff,
I
despise
it.
I
will
either
be
all
or
nothing
to
a
man
like
Robert;
no
feeble
shuffling
or
false
cant
is
endurable.
Once
let
that
pair
be
united,
and
I
will
certainly
leave
them.
As
for
lingering
about,
playing
the
hypocrite,
and
pretending
to
calm
sentiments
of
friendship,
when
my
soul
will
be
wrung
with
other
feelings,
I
shall
not
descend
to
such
degradation.
As
little
could
I
fill
the
place
of
their
mutual
friend
as
that
of
their
deadly
foe;
as
little
could
I
stand
between
them
as
trample
over
them.
Robert
is
a
first
rate
man
in
my
eyes.
I
have
loved,
do
love,
and
must
love
him.
I
would
be
his
wife
if
I
could;
as
I
cannot,
I
must
go
where
I
shall
never
see
him.
There
is
but
one
alternative
to
cleave
to
him
as
if
I
were
a
part
of
him,
or
to
be
sundered
from
him
wide
as
the
two
poles
of
a
sphere.
Sunder
me
then,
Providence.
Part
us
speedily."
Some
such
aspirations
as
these
were
again
working
in
her
mind
late
in
the
afternoon,
when
the
apparition
of
one
of
the
personages
haunting
her
thoughts
passed
the
parlour
window.
Miss
Keeldar
sauntered
slowly
by,
her
gait,
her
countenance,
wearing
that
mixture
of
wistfulness
and
carelessness
which,
when
quiescent,
was
the
wonted
cast
of
her
look
and
character
of
her
bearing.
When
animated,
the
carelessness
quite
vanished,
the
wistfulness
became
blent
with
a
genial
gaiety,
seasoning
the
laugh,
the
smile,
the
glance,
with
a
unique
flavour
of
sentiment,
so
that
mirth
from
her
never
resembled
"the
crackling
of
thorns
under
a
pot."
"What
do
you
mean
by
not
coming
to
see
me
this
afternoon,
as
you
promised?"
was
her
address
to
Caroline
as
she
entered
the
room.
"I
was
not
in
the
