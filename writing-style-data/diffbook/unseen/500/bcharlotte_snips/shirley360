sternly
offered
myself
my
fine
person
with
my
debts,
of
course,
as
a
settlement.
"It
vexed
me,
it
kindled
my
ire,
to
find
that
she
neither
blushed,
trembled,
nor
looked
down.
She
responded,
'I
doubt
whether
I
have
understood
you,
Mr.
Moore.'
"And
I
had
to
go
over
the
whole
proposal
twice,
and
word
it
as
plainly
as
A
B
C,
before
she
would
fully
take
it
in.
And
then,
what
did
she
do?
Instead
of
faltering
a
sweet
Yes,
or
maintaining
a
soft,
confused
silence
(which
would
have
been
as
good),
she
started
up,
walked
twice
fast
through
the
room,
in
the
way
that
she
only
does,
and
no
other
woman,
and
ejaculated,
'God
bless
me!'
"Yorke,
I
stood
on
the
hearth,
backed
by
the
mantelpiece;
against
it
I
leaned,
and
prepared
for
anything
everything.
I
knew
my
doom,
and
I
knew
myself.
There
was
no
misunderstanding
her
aspect
and
voice.
She
stopped
and
looked
at
me.
"'God
bless
me!'
she
piteously
repeated,
in
that
shocked,
indignant,
yet
saddened
accent.
'You
have
made
a
strange
proposal
strange
from
you;
and
if
you
knew
how
strangely
you
worded
it
and
looked
it,
you
would
be
startled
at
yourself.
You
spoke
like
a
brigand
who
demanded
my
purse
rather
than
like
a
lover
who
asked
my
heart.'
"A
queer
sentence,
was
it
not,
Yorke?
And
I
knew,
as
she
uttered
it,
it
was
true
as
queer.
Her
words
were
a
mirror
in
which
I
saw
myself.
"I
looked
at
her,
dumb
and
wolfish.
She
at
once
enraged
and
shamed
me.
"'Gerard
Moore,
you
know
you
don't
love
Shirley
Keeldar.'
I
might
have
broken
out
into
false
swearing
vowed
that
I
did
love
her;
but
I
could
not
lie
in
her
pure
face.
I
could
not
perjure
myself
in
her
truthful
presence.
Besides,
such
hollow
oaths
would
have
been
vain
as
void.
She
would
no
more
have
believed
me
than
she
would
have
believed
the
ghost
of
Judas,
had
he
broken
from
the
night
and
stood
before
her.
Her
female
heart
had
finer
perceptions
than
to
be
cheated
into
mistaking
my
half
coarse,
half
cold
admiration
for
true
throbbing,
manly
love.
"What
next
happened?
you
will
say,
Mr.
Yorke.
"Why,
she
sat
down
in
the
window
seat
and
cried.
She
cried
passionately.
Her
eyes
not
only
rained
but
lightened.
They
flashed,
open,
large,
dark,
haughty,
upon
me.
They
said,
'You
have
pained
me;
you
have
outraged
me;
you
have
deceived
me.'
"She
added
words
soon
to
looks.
"'I
did
respect
I
did
admire
I
did
like
you,'
she
said
'yes,
as
much
as
if
you
were
my
brother;
and
you
you
want
to
make
a
speculation
of
me.
You
would
immolate
me
to
that
mill,
your
Moloch!'
"I
had
the
common
sense
to
abstain
from
any
word
of
excuse,
any
attempt
at
palliation.
I
stood
to
be
scorned.
"Sold
to
the
devil
for
the
time
being,
I
was
certainly
infatuated.
When
I
did
speak,
what
do
you
think
I
said?
"'Whatever
