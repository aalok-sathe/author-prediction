trio;
small
English
features
they
all
possess;
all
own
a
blended
resemblance
to
sire
and
mother;
and
yet
a
distinctive
physiognomy,
mark
of
a
separate
character,
belongs
to
each.
I
shall
not
say
much
about
Matthew,
the
first
born
of
the
house,
though
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
gazing
at
him
long,
and
conjecturing
what
qualities
that
visage
hides
or
indicates.
He
is
no
plain
looking
boy:
that
jet
black
hair,
white
brow,
high
coloured
cheek,
those
quick,
dark
eyes,
are
good
points
in
their
way.
How
is
it
that,
look
as
long
as
you
will,
there
is
but
one
object
in
the
room,
and
that
the
most
sinister,
to
which
Matthew's
face
seems
to
bear
an
affinity,
and
of
which,
ever
and
anon,
it
reminds
you
strangely
the
eruption
of
Vesuvius?
Flame
and
shadow
seem
the
component
parts
of
that
lad's
soul
no
daylight
in
it,
and
no
sunshine,
and
no
pure,
cool
moonbeam
ever
shone
there.
He
has
an
English
frame,
but,
apparently,
not
an
English
mind
you
would
say,
an
Italian
stiletto
in
a
sheath
of
British
workmanship.
He
is
crossed
in
the
game
look
at
his
scowl.
Mr.
Yorke
sees
it,
and
what
does
he
say?
In
a
low
voice
he
pleads,
"Mark
and
Martin,
don't
anger
your
brother."
And
this
is
ever
the
tone
adopted
by
both
parents.
Theoretically,
they
decry
partiality
no
rights
of
primogeniture
are
to
be
allowed
in
that
house;
but
Matthew
is
never
to
be
vexed,
never
to
be
opposed;
they
avert
provocation
from
him
as
assiduously
as
they
would
avert
fire
from
a
barrel
of
gunpowder.
"Concede,
conciliate,"
is
their
motto
wherever
he
is
concerned.
The
republicans
are
fast
making
a
tyrant
of
their
own
flesh
and
blood.
This
the
younger
scions
know
and
feel,
and
at
heart
they
all
rebel
against
the
injustice.
They
cannot
read
their
parents'
motives;
they
only
see
the
difference
of
treatment.
The
dragon's
teeth
are
already
sown
amongst
Mr.
Yorke's
young
olive
branches;
discord
will
one
day
be
the
harvest.
Mark
is
a
bonny
looking
boy,
the
most
regular
featured
of
the
family.
He
is
exceedingly
calm;
his
smile
is
shrewd;
he
can
say
the
driest,
most
cutting
things
in
the
quietest
of
tones.
Despite
his
tranquillity,
a
somewhat
heavy
brow
speaks
temper,
and
reminds
you
that
the
smoothest
waters
are
not
always
the
safest.
Besides,
he
is
too
still,
unmoved,
phlegmatic,
to
be
happy.
Life
will
never
have
much
joy
in
it
for
Mark.
By
the
time
he
is
five
and
twenty
he
will
wonder
why
people
ever
laugh,
and
think
all
fools
who
seem
merry.
Poetry
will
not
exist
for
Mark,
either
in
literature
or
in
life;
its
best
effusions
will
sound
to
him
mere
rant
and
jargon.
Enthusiasm
will
be
his
aversion
and
contempt.
Mark
will
have
no
youth;
while
he
looks
juvenile
and
blooming,
he
will
be
already
middle
aged
in
mind.
His
body
is
now
fourteen
years
of
age,
but
his
soul
is
already
thirty.
Martin,
the
youngest
of
