little
of
Mrs.
Yorke,
and,
as
a
parson's
niece,
was
doubtful
what
sort
of
a
reception
she
might
get.
She
got
a
very
cool
one,
and
was
glad
to
hide
her
discomfiture
by
turning
away
to
take
off
her
bonnet.
Nor,
upon
sitting
down,
was
she
displeased
to
be
immediately
accosted
by
a
little
personage
in
a
blue
frock
and
sash,
who
started
up
like
some
fairy
from
the
side
of
the
great
dame's
chair,
where
she
had
been
sitting
on
a
footstool,
screened
from
view
by
the
folds
of
the
wide
red
gown,
and
running
to
Miss
Helstone,
unceremoniously
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
demanded
a
kiss.
"My
mother
is
not
civil
to
you,"
said
the
petitioner,
as
she
received
and
repaid
a
smiling
salute,
"and
Rose
there
takes
no
notice
of
you;
it
is
their
way.
If,
instead
of
you,
a
white
angel,
with
a
crown
of
stars,
had
come
into
the
room,
mother
would
nod
stiffly,
and
Rose
never
lift
her
head
at
all;
but
I
will
be
your
friend
I
have
always
liked
you."
"Jessie,
curb
that
tongue
of
yours,
and
repress
your
forwardness!"
said
Mrs.
Yorke.
"But,
mother,
you
are
so
frozen!"
expostulated
Jessie.
"Miss
Helstone
has
never
done
you
any
harm;
why
can't
you
be
kind
to
her?
You
sit
so
stiff,
and
look
so
cold,
and
speak
so
dry
what
for?
That's
just
the
fashion
in
which
you
treat
Miss
Shirley
Keeldar
and
every
other
young
lady
who
comes
to
our
house.
And
Rose
there
is
such
an
aut
aut
I
have
forgotten
the
word,
but
it
means
a
machine
in
the
shape
of
a
human
being.
However,
between
you,
you
will
drive
every
soul
away
from
Briarmains;
Martin
often
says
so."
"I
am
an
automaton?
Good!
Let
me
alone,
then,"
said
Rose,
speaking
from
a
corner
where
she
was
sitting
on
the
carpet
at
the
foot
of
a
bookcase,
with
a
volume
spread
open
on
her
knee.
"Miss
Helstone,
how
do
you
do?"
she
added,
directing
a
brief
glance
to
the
person
addressed,
and
then
again
casting
down
her
gray,
remarkable
eyes
on
the
book
and
returning
to
the
study
of
its
pages.
Caroline
stole
a
quiet
gaze
towards
her,
dwelling
on
her
young,
absorbed
countenance,
and
observing
a
certain
unconscious
movement
of
the
mouth
as
she
read
a
movement
full
of
character.
Caroline
had
tact,
and
she
had
fine
instinct.
She
felt
that
Rose
Yorke
was
a
peculiar
child
one
of
the
unique;
she
knew
how
to
treat
her.
Approaching
quietly,
she
knelt
on
the
carpet
at
her
side,
and
looked
over
her
little
shoulder
at
her
book.
It
was
a
romance
of
Mrs.
Radcliffe's
"The
Italian."
Caroline
read
on
with
her,
making
no
remark.
Presently
Rose
showed
her
the
attention
of
asking,
ere
she
turned
the
leaf,
"Are
you
ready?"
Caroline
only
nodded.
"Do
you
like
it?"
inquired
Rose
ere
long.
"Long
since,
when
I
read
it
as
a
child,
I
was
wonderfully
taken
with
it."
"Why?"
"It
