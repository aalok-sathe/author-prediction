a
little
sternly.
"You
ought
to
be
glad
instead
of
sorry.
Robert
has
escaped
any
serious
harm;
he
is
victorious;
he
has
been
cool
and
brave
in
combat;
he
is
now
considerate
in
triumph.
Is
this
a
time
are
these
causes
for
weeping?"
"You
do
not
know
what
I
have
in
my
heart,"
pleaded
the
other
"what
pain,
what
distraction
nor
whence
it
arises.
I
can
understand
that
you
should
exult
in
Robert's
greatness
and
goodness;
so
do
I,
in
one
sense,
but
in
another
I
feel
so
miserable.
I
am
too
far
removed
from
him.
I
used
to
be
nearer.
Let
me
alone,
Shirley.
Do
let
me
cry
a
few
minutes;
it
relieves
me."
Miss
Keeldar,
feeling
her
tremble
in
every
limb,
ceased
to
expostulate
with
her.
She
went
out
of
the
shed,
and
left
her
to
weep
in
peace.
It
was
the
best
plan.
In
a
few
minutes
Caroline
rejoined
her,
much
calmer.
She
said,
with
her
natural,
docile,
gentle
manner,
"Come,
Shirley,
we
will
go
home
now.
I
promise
not
to
try
to
see
Robert
again
till
he
asks
for
me.
I
never
will
try
to
push
myself
on
him.
I
thank
you
for
restraining
me
just
now."
"I
did
it
with
a
good
intention,"
returned
Miss
Keeldar.
"Now,
dear
Lina,"
she
continued,
"let
us
turn
our
faces
to
the
cool
morning
breeze,
and
walk
very
quietly
back
to
the
rectory.
We
will
steal
in
as
we
stole
out.
None
shall
know
where
we
have
been
or
what
we
have
seen
to
night;
neither
taunt
nor
misconstruction
can
consequently
molest
us.
To
morrow
we
will
see
Robert,
and
be
of
good
cheer;
but
I
will
say
no
more,
lest
I
should
begin
to
cry
too.
I
seem
hard
towards
you,
but
I
am
not
so."
The
two
girls
met
no
living
soul
on
their
way
back
to
the
rectory.
They
let
themselves
in
noiselessly;
they
stole
upstairs
unheard
the
breaking
morning
gave
them
what
light
they
needed.
Shirley
sought
her
couch
immediately;
and
though
the
room
was
strange
for
she
had
never
slept
at
the
rectory
before
and
though
the
recent
scene
was
one
unparalleled
for
excitement
and
terror
by
any
it
had
hitherto
been
her
lot
to
witness,
yet
scarce
was
her
head
laid
on
the
pillow
ere
a
deep,
refreshing
sleep
closed
her
eyes
and
calmed
her
senses.
Perfect
health
was
Shirley's
enviable
portion.
Though
warm
hearted
and
sympathetic,
she
was
not
nervous;
powerful
emotions
could
rouse
and
sway
without
exhausting
her
spirit.
The
tempest
troubled
and
shook
her
while
it
lasted,
but
it
left
her
elasticity
unbent,
and
her
freshness
quite
unblighted.
As
every
day
brought
her
stimulating
emotion,
so
every
night
yielded
her
recreating
rest.
Caroline
now
watched
her
sleeping,
and
read
the
serenity
of
her
mind
in
the
beauty
of
her
happy
countenance.
For
herself,
being
of
a
different
temperament,
she
could
not
sleep.
The
commonplace
excitement
of
the
tea
drinking
and
school
gathering
would
alone
have
sufficed
to
make
her
restless
