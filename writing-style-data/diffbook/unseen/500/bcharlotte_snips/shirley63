it
unjust
to
include
all
poor
working
people
under
the
general
and
insulting
name
of
'the
mob,'
and
continually
to
think
of
them
and
treat
them
haughtily."
"You
are
a
little
democrat,
Caroline.
If
your
uncle
knew,
what
would
he
say?"
"I
rarely
talk
to
my
uncle,
as
you
know,
and
never
about
such
things.
He
thinks
everything
but
sewing
and
cooking
above
women's
comprehension,
and
out
of
their
line."
"And
do
you
fancy
you
comprehend
the
subjects
on
which
you
advise
me?"
"As
far
as
they
concern
you,
I
comprehend
them.
I
know
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
be
loved
by
your
workpeople
than
to
be
hated
by
them,
and
I
am
sure
that
kindness
is
more
likely
to
win
their
regard
than
pride.
If
you
were
proud
and
cold
to
me
and
Hortense,
should
we
love
you?
When
you
are
cold
to
me,
as
you
are
sometimes,
can
I
venture
to
be
affectionate
in
return?"
"Now,
Lina,
I've
had
my
lesson
both
in
languages
and
ethics,
with
a
touch
on
politics;
it
is
your
turn.
Hortense
tells
me
you
were
much
taken
by
a
little
piece
of
poetry
you
learned
the
other
day,
a
piece
by
poor
Andre
Chenier
'La
Jeune
Captive.'
Do
you
remember
it
still?"
"I
think
so."
"Repeat
it,
then.
Take
your
time
and
mind
your
accent;
especially
let
us
have
no
English
u's."
Caroline,
beginning
in
a
low,
rather
tremulous
voice,
but
gaining
courage
as
she
proceeded,
repeated
the
sweet
verses
of
Chenier.
The
last
three
stanzas
she
rehearsed
well.
"Mon
beau
voyage
encore
est
si
loin
de
sa
fin!
Je
pars,
et
des
ormeaux
qui
bordent
le
chemin
J'ai
passe
le
premiers
a
peine.
Au
banquet
de
la
vie
a
peine
commence,
Un
instant
seulement
mes
levres
ont
presse
La
coupe
en
mes
mains
encore
pleine.
"Je
ne
suis
qu'au
printemps
je
veux
voir
la
moisson;
Et
comme
le
soleil,
de
saison
en
saison,
Je
veux
achever
mon
annee,
Brillante
sur
ma
tige,
et
l'honneur
du
jardin
Je
n'ai
vu
luire
encore
que
les
feux
du
matin,
Je
veux
achever
ma
journee!"
Moore
listened
at
first
with
his
eyes
cast
down,
but
soon
he
furtively
raised
them.
Leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
could
watch
Caroline
without
her
perceiving
where
his
gaze
was
fixed.
Her
cheek
had
a
colour,
her
eyes
a
light,
her
countenance
an
expression
this
evening
which
would
have
made
even
plain
features
striking;
but
there
was
not
the
grievous
defect
of
plainness
to
pardon
in
her
case.
The
sunshine
was
not
shed
on
rough
barrenness;
it
fell
on
soft
bloom.
Each
lineament
was
turned
with
grace;
the
whole
aspect
was
pleasing.
At
the
present
moment
animated,
interested,
touched
she
might
be
called
beautiful.
Such
a
face
was
calculated
to
awaken
not
only
the
calm
sentiment
of
esteem,
the
distant
one
of
admiration,
but
some
feeling
more
tender,
genial,
intimate
friendship,
perhaps,
affection,
interest.
When
she
had
finished,
she
turned
to
Moore,
and
met
his
eye.
"Is
