had
spent
with
him
in
a
great
town
somewhere,
when
she
had
had
no
maid
to
dress
her
or
take
care
of
her;
when
she
had
been
shut
up,
day
and
night,
in
a
high
garret
room,
without
a
carpet,
with
a
bare
uncurtained
bed,
and
scarcely
any
other
furniture;
when
he
went
out
early
every
morning,
and
often
forgot
to
return
and
give
her
her
dinner
during
the
day,
and
at
night,
when
he
came
back,
was
like
a
madman,
furious,
terrible,
or
still
more
painful
like
an
idiot,
imbecile,
senseless.
She
knew
she
had
fallen
ill
in
this
place,
and
that
one
night,
when
she
was
very
sick
he
had
come
raving
into
the
room,
and
said
he
would
kill
her,
for
she
was
a
burden
to
him.
Her
screams
had
brought
aid;
and
from
the
moment
she
was
then
rescued
from
him
she
had
never
seen
him,
except
as
a
dead
man
in
his
coffin.
That
was
her
father.
Also
she
had
a
mother,
though
Mr.
Helstone
never
spoke
to
her
of
that
mother,
though
she
could
not
remember
having
seen
her;
but
that
she
was
alive
she
knew.
This
mother
was
then
the
drunkard's
wife.
What
had
their
marriage
been?
Caroline,
turning
from
the
lattice,
whence
she
had
been
watching
the
starlings
(though
without
seeing
them),
in
a
low
voice,
and
with
a
sad,
bitter
tone,
thus
broke
the
silence
of
the
room,
"You
term
marriage
miserable,
I
suppose,
from
what
you
saw
of
my
father
and
mother's.
If
my
mother
suffered
what
I
suffered
when
I
was
with
papa,
she
must
have
had
a
dreadful
life."
Mr.
Helstone,
thus
addressed,
wheeled
about
in
his
chair,
and
looked
over
his
spectacles
at
his
niece.
He
was
taken
aback.
Her
father
and
mother!
What
had
put
it
into
her
head
to
mention
her
father
and
mother,
of
whom
he
had
never,
during
the
twelve
years
she
had
lived
with
him,
spoken
to
her?
That
the
thoughts
were
self
matured,
that
she
had
any
recollections
or
speculations
about
her
parents,
he
could
not
fancy.
"Your
father
and
mother?
Who
has
been
talking
to
you
about
them?"
"Nobody;
but
I
remember
something
of
what
papa
was,
and
I
pity
mamma.
Where
is
she?"
This
"Where
is
she?"
had
been
on
Caroline's
lips
hundreds
of
times
before,
but
till
now
she
had
never
uttered
it.
"I
hardly
know,"
returned
Mr.
Helstone;
"I
was
little
acquainted
with
her.
I
have
not
heard
from
her
for
years:
but
wherever
she
is,
she
thinks
nothing
of
you;
she
never
inquires
about
you.
I
have
reason
to
believe
she
does
not
wish
to
see
you.
Come,
it
is
school
time.
You
go
to
your
cousin
at
ten,
don't
you?
The
clock
has
struck."
Perhaps
Caroline
would
have
said
more;
but
Fanny,
coming
in,
informed
her
master
that
the
churchwardens
wanted
to
speak
to
him
in
the
vestry.
He
hastened
to
join
them,
and
his
niece
presently
set
out
for
the
cottage.
