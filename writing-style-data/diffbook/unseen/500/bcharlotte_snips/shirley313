"You
have
not
forgotten,
then,
Hal?"
"Not
at
all.
We
were
all
scolded
that
day
for
not
coming
down
to
tea
when
called.
I
can
remember
my
tutor
sitting
at
his
easel,
and
you
standing
behind
him,
holding
the
candle,
and
watching
him
draw
the
snowy
cliff,
the
pine,
the
deer
couched
under
it,
and
the
half
moon
hung
above."
"Where
are
his
drawings,
Harry?
Caroline
should
see
them."
"In
his
portfolio.
But
it
is
padlocked;
he
has
the
key."
"Ask
him
for
it
when
he
comes
in."
"You
should
ask
him,
Shirley.
You
are
shy
of
him
now.
You
are
grown
a
proud
lady
to
him;
I
notice
that."
"Shirley,
you
are
a
real
enigma,"
whispered
Caroline
in
her
ear.
"What
queer
discoveries
I
make
day
by
day
now!
I
who
thought
I
had
your
confidence.
Inexplicable
creature!
even
this
boy
reproves
you."
"I
have
forgotten
'auld
lang
syne,'
you
see,
Harry,"
said
Miss
Keeldar,
answering
young
Sympson,
and
not
heeding
Caroline.
"Which
you
never
should
have
done.
You
don't
deserve
to
be
a
man's
morning
star
if
you
have
so
short
a
memory."
"A
man's
morning
star,
indeed!
and
by
'a
man'
is
meant
your
worshipful
self,
I
suppose?
Come,
drink
your
new
milk
while
it
is
warm."
The
young
cripple
rose
and
limped
towards
the
fire;
he
had
left
his
crutch
near
the
mantelpiece.
"My
poor
lame
darling!"
murmured
Shirley,
in
her
softest
voice,
aiding
him.
"Whether
do
you
like
me
or
Mr.
Sam
Wynne
best,
Shirley?"
inquired
the
boy,
as
she
settled
him
in
an
arm
chair.
"O
Harry,
Sam
Wynne
is
my
aversion;
you
are
my
pet."
"Me
or
Mr.
Malone?"
"You
again,
a
thousand
times."
"Yet
they
are
great
whiskered
fellows,
six
feet
high
each."
"Whereas,
as
long
as
you
live,
Harry,
you
will
never
be
anything
more
than
a
little
pale
lameter."
"Yes,
I
know."
"You
need
not
be
sorrowful.
Have
I
not
often
told
you
who
was
almost
as
little,
as
pale,
as
suffering
as
you,
and
yet
potent
as
a
giant
and
brave
as
a
lion?"
"Admiral
Horatio?"
"Admiral
Horatio,
Viscount
Nelson,
and
Duke
of
Bronte;
great
at
heart
as
a
Titan;
gallant
and
heroic
as
all
the
world
and
age
of
chivalry;
leader
of
the
might
of
England;
commander
of
her
strength
on
the
deep;
hurler
of
her
thunder
over
the
flood."
"A
great
man.
But
I
am
not
warlike,
Shirley;
and
yet
my
mind
is
so
restless
I
burn
day
and
night
for
what
I
can
hardly
tell
to
be
to
do
to
suffer,
I
think."
"Harry,
it
is
your
mind,
which
is
stronger
and
older
than
your
frame,
that
troubles
you.
It
is
a
captive;
it
lies
in
physical
bondage.
But
it
will
work
its
own
redemption
yet.
Study
carefully
not
only
books
but
the
world.
You
love
nature;
love
her
without
fear.
Be
patient
wait
the
course
of
time.
You
will
not
be
a
soldier
or
a
sailor,
Henry;
but
if
you
live
you
will
be
listen
