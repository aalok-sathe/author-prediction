affability
had
come
in
my
way
when
I
was
recluse,
desolate,
young,
and
ignorant
a
toil
worn
governess
perishing
of
uncheered
labour,
breaking
down
before
her
time.
These,
Caroline,
when
they
smiled
on
me,
I
mistook
for
angels.
I
followed
them
home;
and
when
into
their
hands
I
had
given
without
reserve
my
whole
chance
of
future
happiness,
it
was
my
lot
to
witness
a
transfiguration
on
the
domestic
hearth
to
see
the
white
mask
lifted,
the
bright
disguise
put
away,
and
opposite
me
sat
down
O
God,
I
have
suffered!"
She
sank
on
the
pillow.
"I
have
suffered!
None
saw
none
knew.
There
was
no
sympathy,
no
redemption,
no
redress!"
"Take
comfort,
mother.
It
is
over
now."
"It
is
over,
and
not
fruitlessly.
I
tried
to
keep
the
word
of
His
patience.
He
kept
me
in
the
days
of
my
anguish.
I
was
afraid
with
terror
I
was
troubled.
Through
great
tribulation
He
brought
me
through
to
a
salvation
revealed
in
this
last
time.
My
fear
had
torment;
He
has
cast
it
out.
He
has
given
me
in
its
stead
perfect
love.
But,
Caroline
"
Thus
she
invoked
her
daughter
after
a
pause.
"Mother!"
"I
charge
you,
when
you
next
look
on
your
father's
monument,
to
respect
the
name
chiselled
there.
To
you
he
did
only
good.
On
you
he
conferred
his
whole
treasure
of
beauties,
nor
added
to
them
one
dark
defect.
All
you
derived
from
him
is
excellent.
You
owe
him
gratitude.
Leave,
between
him
and
me,
the
settlement
of
our
mutual
account.
Meddle
not.
God
is
the
arbiter.
This
world's
laws
never
came
near
us
never!
They
were
powerless
as
a
rotten
bulrush
to
protect
me
impotent
as
idiot
babblings
to
restrain
him!
As
you
said,
it
is
all
over
now;
the
grave
lies
between
us.
There
he
sleeps,
in
that
church.
To
his
dust
I
say
this
night,
what
I
have
never
said
before,
'James,
slumber
peacefully!
See!
your
terrible
debt
is
cancelled!
Look!
I
wipe
out
the
long,
black
account
with
my
own
hand!
James,
your
child
atones.
This
living
likeness
of
you
this
thing
with
your
perfect
features
this
one
good
gift
you
gave
me
has
nestled
affectionately
to
my
heart,
and
tenderly
called
me
"mother."
Husband,
rest
forgiven!'"
"Dearest
mother,
that
is
right!
Can
papa's
spirit
hear
us?
Is
he
comforted
to
know
that
we
still
love
him?"
"I
said
nothing
of
love.
I
spoke
of
forgiveness.
Mind
the
truth,
child;
I
said
nothing
of
love!
On
the
threshold
of
eternity,
should
he
be
there
to
see
me
enter,
will
I
maintain
that."
"O
mother,
you
must
have
suffered!"
"O
child,
the
human
heart
can
suffer!
It
can
hold
more
tears
than
the
ocean
holds
waters.
We
never
know
how
deep,
how
wide
it
is,
till
misery
begins
to
unbind
her
clouds,
and
fill
it
with
rushing
blackness."
"Mother,
forget."
"Forget!"
she
said,
with
the
strangest
spectre
of
a
laugh.
"The
north
pole
will
rush
to
the
south,
and
the
headlands
of
