from
that
chateau
on
the
Scheldt
Miss
Moore
talks
about."
"Martin,"
said
the
softest
whisper
at
the
door,
"don't
be
foolish."
"Is
she
there?"
inquired
Moore
hastily.
He
had
caught
an
imperfect
sound.
"She
is
there,
fit
to
faint.
She
is
standing
on
the
mat,
shocked
at
your
want
of
filial
affection."
"Martin,
you
are
an
evil
cross
between
an
imp
and
a
page.
What
is
she
like?"
"More
like
me
than
you;
for
she
is
young
and
beautiful."
"You
are
to
show
her
forward.
Do
you
hear?"
"Come,
Miss
Caroline."
"Miss
Caroline!"
repeated
Moore.
And
when
Miss
Caroline
entered
she
was
encountered
in
the
middle
of
the
chamber
by
a
tall,
thin,
wasted
figure,
who
took
both
her
hands.
"I
give
you
a
quarter
of
an
hour,"
said
Martin,
as
he
withdrew,
"no
more.
Say
what
you
have
to
say
in
that
time.
Till
it
is
past
I
will
wait
in
the
gallery;
nothing
shall
approach;
I'll
see
you
safe
away.
Should
you
persist
in
staying
longer,
I
leave
you
to
your
fate."
He
shut
the
door.
In
the
gallery
he
was
as
elate
as
a
king.
He
had
never
been
engaged
in
an
adventure
he
liked
so
well,
for
no
adventure
had
ever
invested
him
with
so
much
importance
or
inspired
him
with
so
much
interest.
"You
are
come
at
last,"
said
the
meagre
man,
gazing
on
his
visitress
with
hollow
eyes.
"Did
you
expect
me
before?"
"For
a
month,
near
two
months,
we
have
been
very
near;
and
I
have
been
in
sad
pain,
and
danger,
and
misery,
Cary."
"I
could
not
come."
"Couldn't
you?
But
the
rectory
and
Briarmains
are
very
near
not
two
miles
apart."
There
was
pain
and
there
was
pleasure
in
the
girl's
face
as
she
listened
to
these
implied
reproaches.
It
was
sweet,
it
was
bitter
to
defend
herself.
"When
I
say
I
could
not
come,
I
mean
I
could
not
see
you;
for
I
came
with
mamma
the
very
day
we
heard
what
had
happened.
Mr.
MacTurk
then
told
us
it
was
impossible
to
admit
any
stranger."
"But
afterwards
every
fine
afternoon
these
many
weeks
past
I
have
waited
and
listened.
Something
here,
Cary"
laying
his
hand
on
his
breast
"told
me
it
was
impossible
but
that
you
should
think
of
me.
Not
that
I
merit
thought;
but
we
are
old
acquaintance
we
are
cousins."
"I
came
again,
Robert;
mamma
and
I
came
again."
"Did
you?
Come,
that
is
worth
hearing.
Since
you
came
again,
we
will
sit
down
and
talk
about
it."
They
sat
down.
Caroline
drew
her
chair
up
to
his.
The
air
was
now
dark
with
snow;
an
Iceland
blast
was
driving
it
wildly.
This
pair
neither
heard
the
long
"wuthering"
rush,
nor
saw
the
white
burden
it
drifted.
Each
seemed
conscious
but
of
one
thing
the
presence
of
the
other.
"So
mamma
and
you
came
again?"
"And
Mrs.
Yorke
did
treat
us
strangely.
We
asked
to
see
you.
'No,'
said
she,
'not
in
my
house.
I
am
