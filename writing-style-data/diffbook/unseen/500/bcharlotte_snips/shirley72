but
why?
Because
she
had
made
herself
so
pleasing
to
him,
he
could
not,
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts,
help
testifying
a
state
of
feeling
his
judgment
did
not
approve
nor
his
will
sanction.
He
was
about
to
withdraw
decidedly
from
intimate
communication
with
her,
because
he
did
not
choose
to
have
his
affections
inextricably
entangled,
nor
to
be
drawn,
despite
his
reason,
into
a
marriage
he
believed
imprudent.
Now,
what
was
she
to
do?
To
give
way
to
her
feelings,
or
to
vanquish
them?
To
pursue
him,
or
to
turn
upon
herself?
If
she
is
weak,
she
will
try
the
first
expedient
will
lose
his
esteem
and
win
his
aversion;
if
she
has
sense,
she
will
be
her
own
governor,
and
resolve
to
subdue
and
bring
under
guidance
the
disturbed
realm
of
her
emotions.
She
will
determine
to
look
on
life
steadily,
as
it
is;
to
begin
to
learn
its
severe
truths
seriously,
and
to
study
its
knotty
problems
closely,
conscientiously.
It
appeared
she
had
a
little
sense,
for
she
quitted
Robert
quietly,
without
complaint
or
question,
without
the
alteration
of
a
muscle
or
the
shedding
of
a
tear,
betook
herself
to
her
studies
under
Hortense
as
usual,
and
at
dinner
time
went
home
without
lingering.
When
she
had
dined,
and
found
herself
in
the
rectory
drawing
room
alone,
having
left
her
uncle
over
his
temperate
glass
of
port
wine,
the
difficulty
that
occurred
to
and
embarrassed
her
was,
"How
am
I
to
get
through
this
day?"
Last
night
she
had
hoped
it
would
be
spent
as
yesterday
was,
that
the
evening
would
be
again
passed
with
happiness
and
Robert.
She
had
learned
her
mistake
this
morning;
and
yet
she
could
not
settle
down,
convinced
that
no
chance
would
occur
to
recall
her
to
Hollow's
Cottage,
or
to
bring
Moore
again
into
her
society.
He
had
walked
up
after
tea
more
than
once
to
pass
an
hour
with
her
uncle.
The
door
bell
had
rung,
his
voice
had
been
heard
in
the
passage
just
at
twilight,
when
she
little
expected
such
a
pleasure;
and
this
had
happened
twice
after
he
had
treated
her
with
peculiar
reserve;
and
though
he
rarely
talked
to
her
in
her
uncle's
presence,
he
had
looked
at
her
relentingly
as
he
sat
opposite
her
work
table
during
his
stay.
The
few
words
he
had
spoken
to
her
were
comforting;
his
manner
on
bidding
her
good
night
was
genial.
Now,
he
might
come
this
evening,
said
False
Hope.
She
almost
knew
it
was
False
Hope
which
breathed
the
whisper,
and
yet
she
listened.
She
tried
to
read
her
thoughts
wandered;
she
tried
to
sew
every
stitch
she
put
in
was
an
ennui,
the
occupation
was
insufferably
tedious;
she
opened
her
desk
and
attempted
to
write
a
French
composition
she
wrote
nothing
but
mistakes.
Suddenly
the
door
bell
sharply
rang;
her
heart
leaped;
she
sprang
to
the
drawing
room
door,
opened
it
softly,
peeped
through
the
aperture.
Fanny
was
admitting
a
visitor
a
gentleman
