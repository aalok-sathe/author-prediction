uncle
sneering,
Mr.
Sykes
sipping
a
cordial,
and
Moore
himself
in
his
cold
man
of
business
vein!
I
am
glad
we
missed
it
all."
"I
wonder
if
there
are
many
in
the
mill,
Shirley!"
"Plenty
to
defend
it.
The
soldiers
we
have
twice
seen
to
day
were
going
there,
no
doubt,
and
the
group
we
noticed
surrounding
your
cousin
in
the
fields
will
be
with
him."
"What
are
they
doing
now,
Shirley?
What
is
that
noise?"
"Hatchets
and
crowbars
against
the
yard
gates.
They
are
forcing
them.
Are
you
afraid?"
"No;
but
my
heart
throbs
fast.
I
have
a
difficulty
in
standing.
I
will
sit
down.
Do
you
feel
unmoved?"
"Hardly
that;
but
I
am
glad
I
came.
We
shall
see
what
transpires
with
our
own
eyes.
We
are
here
on
the
spot,
and
none
know
it.
Instead
of
amazing
the
curate,
the
clothier,
and
the
corn
dealer
with
a
romantic
rush
on
the
stage,
we
stand
alone
with
the
friendly
night,
its
mute
stars,
and
these
whispering
trees,
whose
report
our
friends
will
not
come
to
gather."
"Shirley,
Shirley,
the
gates
are
down!
That
crash
was
like
the
felling
of
great
trees.
Now
they
are
pouring
through.
They
will
break
down
the
mill
doors
as
they
have
broken
the
gate.
What
can
Robert
do
against
so
many?
Would
to
God
I
were
a
little
nearer
him
could
hear
him
speak
could
speak
to
him!
With
my
will
my
longing
to
serve
him
I
could
not
be
a
useless
burden
in
his
way;
I
could
be
turned
to
some
account."
"They
come
on!"
cried
Shirley.
"How
steadily
they
march
in!
There
is
discipline
in
their
ranks.
I
will
not
say
there
is
courage
hundreds
against
tens
are
no
proof
of
that
quality
but"
(she
dropped
her
voice)
"there
is
suffering
and
desperation
enough
amongst
them.
These
goads
will
urge
them
forwards."
"Forwards
against
Robert;
and
they
hate
him.
Shirley,
is
there
much
danger
they
will
win
the
day?"
"We
shall
see.
Moore
and
Helstone
are
of
'earth's
first
blood'
no
bunglers
no
cravens
"
A
crash
smash
shiver
stopped
their
whispers.
A
simultaneously
hurled
volley
of
stones
had
saluted
the
broad
front
of
the
mill,
with
all
its
windows;
and
now
every
pane
of
every
lattice
lay
in
shattered
and
pounded
fragments.
A
yell
followed
this
demonstration
a
rioters'
yell
a
north
of
England,
a
Yorkshire,
a
West
Riding,
a
West
Riding
clothing
district
of
Yorkshire
rioters'
yell.
You
never
heard
that
sound,
perhaps,
reader?
So
much
the
better
for
your
ears
perhaps
for
your
heart,
since,
if
it
rends
the
air
in
hate
to
yourself,
or
to
the
men
or
principles
you
approve,
the
interests
to
which
you
wish
well,
wrath
wakens
to
the
cry
of
hate;
the
lion
shakes
his
mane,
and
rises
to
the
howl
of
the
hyena;
caste
stands
up,
ireful
against
caste;
and
the
indignant,
wronged
spirit
of
the
middle
rank
bears
down
in
zeal
and
scorn
on
the
famished
and
furious
mass
of
the
