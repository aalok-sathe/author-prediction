more
freshly
when
the
pressure
is
removed;
affection
that
no
passion
can
ultimately
outrival,
with
which
even
love
itself
cannot
do
more
than
compete
in
force
and
truth.
Love
hurts
us
so,
Shirley.
It
is
so
tormenting,
so
racking,
and
it
burns
away
our
strength
with
its
flame.
In
affection
is
no
pain
and
no
fire,
only
sustenance
and
balm.
I
am
supported
and
soothed
when
you
that
is,
you
only
are
near,
Shirley.
Do
you
believe
me
now?"
"I
am
always
easy
of
belief
when
the
creed
pleases
me.
We
really
are
friends,
then,
Lina,
in
spite
of
the
black
eclipse?"
"We
really
are,"
returned
the
other,
drawing
Shirley
towards
her,
and
making
her
sit
down,
"chance
what
may."
"Come,
then;
we
will
talk
of
something
else
than
the
Troubler."
But
at
this
moment
the
rector
came
in,
and
the
"something
else"
of
which
Miss
Keeldar
was
about
to
talk
was
not
again
alluded
to
till
the
moment
of
her
departure.
She
then
delayed
a
few
minutes
in
the
passage
to
say,
"Caroline,
I
wish
to
tell
you
that
I
have
a
great
weight
on
my
mind;
my
conscience
is
quite
uneasy
as
if
I
had
committed,
or
was
going
to
commit,
a
crime.
It
is
not
my
private
conscience,
you
must
understand,
but
my
landed
proprietor
and
lord
of
the
manor
conscience.
I
have
got
into
the
clutch
of
an
eagle
with
iron
talons.
I
have
fallen
under
a
stern
influence,
which
I
scarcely
approve,
but
cannot
resist.
Something
will
be
done
ere
long,
I
fear,
which
it
by
no
means
pleases
me
to
think
of.
To
ease
my
mind,
and
to
prevent
harm
as
far
as
I
can,
I
mean
to
enter
on
a
series
of
good
works.
Don't
be
surprised,
therefore,
if
you
see
me
all
at
once
turn
outrageously
charitable.
I
have
no
idea
how
to
begin,
but
you
must
give
me
some
advice.
We
will
talk
more
on
the
subject
to
morrow;
and
just
ask
that
excellent
person,
Miss
Ainley,
to
step
up
to
Fieldhead.
I
have
some
notion
of
putting
myself
under
her
tuition.
Won't
she
have
a
precious
pupil?
Drop
a
hint
to
her,
Lina,
that,
though
a
well
meaning,
I
am
rather
a
neglected
character,
and
then
she
will
feel
less
scandalized
at
my
ignorance
about
clothing
societies
and
such
things."
On
the
morrow
Caroline
found
Shirley
sitting
gravely
at
her
desk,
with
an
account
book,
a
bundle
of
banknotes,
and
a
well
filled
purse
before
her.
She
was
looking
mighty
serious,
but
a
little
puzzled.
She
said
she
had
been
"casting
an
eye"
over
the
weekly
expenditure
in
housekeeping
at
the
hall,
trying
to
find
out
where
she
could
retrench;
that
she
had
also
just
given
audience
to
Mrs.
Gill,
the
cook,
and
had
sent
that
person
away
with
a
notion
that
her
(Shirley's)
brain
was
certainly
crazed.
"I
have
lectured
her
on
the
duty
of
being
careful,"
said
she,
"in
a
way
quite
new
to
her.
So
eloquent
was
