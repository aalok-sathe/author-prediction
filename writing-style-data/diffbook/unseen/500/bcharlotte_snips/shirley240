her
face
that
life
was
full
of
interest,
expectation,
and
occupation
for
her.
"He
will
have
to
undergo
cross
examination,"
she
added.
"I
dare
say
he
thinks
he
has
outwitted
me
cleverly.
And
this
is
the
way
men
deal
with
women
still
concealing
danger
from
them
thinking,
I
suppose,
to
spare
them
pain.
They
imagined
we
little
knew
where
they
were
to
night.
We
know
they
little
conjectured
where
we
were.
Men,
I
believe,
fancy
women's
minds
something
like
those
of
children.
Now,
that
is
a
mistake."
This
was
said
as
she
stood
at
the
glass,
training
her
naturally
waved
hair
into
curls,
by
twining
it
round
her
fingers.
She
took
up
the
theme
again
five
minutes
after,
as
Caroline
fastened
her
dress
and
clasped
her
girdle.
"If
men
could
see
us
as
we
really
are,
they
would
be
a
little
amazed;
but
the
cleverest,
the
acutest
men
are
often
under
an
illusion
about
women.
They
do
not
read
them
in
a
true
light;
they
misapprehend
them,
both
for
good
and
evil.
Their
good
woman
is
a
queer
thing,
half
doll,
half
angel;
their
bad
woman
almost
always
a
fiend.
Then
to
hear
them
fall
into
ecstasies
with
each
other's
creations
worshipping
the
heroine
of
such
a
poem,
novel,
drama
thinking
it
fine,
divine!
Fine
and
divine
it
may
be,
but
often
quite
artificial
false
as
the
rose
in
my
best
bonnet
there.
If
I
spoke
all
I
think
on
this
point,
if
I
gave
my
real
opinion
of
some
first
rate
female
characters
in
first
rate
works,
where
should
I
be?
Dead
under
a
cairn
of
avenging
stones
in
half
an
hour."
"Shirley,
you
chatter
so,
I
can't
fasten
you.
Be
still.
And,
after
all,
authors'
heroines
are
almost
as
good
as
authoresses'
heroes."
"Not
at
all.
Women
read
men
more
truly
than
men
read
women.
I'll
prove
that
in
a
magazine
paper
some
day
when
I've
time;
only
it
will
never
be
inserted.
It
will
be
'declined
with
thanks,'
and
left
for
me
at
the
publisher's."
"To
be
sure.
You
could
not
write
cleverly
enough.
You
don't
know
enough.
You
are
not
learned,
Shirley."
"God
knows
I
can't
contradict
you,
Cary;
I'm
as
ignorant
as
a
stone.
There's
one
comfort,
however:
you
are
not
much
better."
They
descended
to
breakfast.
"I
wonder
how
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Hortense
Moore
have
passed
the
night,"
said
Caroline,
as
she
made
the
coffee.
"Selfish
being
that
I
am,
I
never
thought
of
either
of
them
till
just
now.
They
will
have
heard
all
the
tumult,
Fieldhead
and
the
cottage
are
so
near;
and
Hortense
is
timid
in
such
matters
so,
no
doubt,
is
Mrs.
Pryor."
"Take
my
word
for
it,
Lina,
Moore
will
have
contrived
to
get
his
sister
out
of
the
way.
She
went
home
with
Miss
Mann.
He
will
have
quartered
her
there
for
the
night.
As
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
I
own
I
am
uneasy
about
her;
but
in
another
half
hour
we
will
be
with
her."
By
this
time
