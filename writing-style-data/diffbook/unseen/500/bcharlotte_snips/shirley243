have
the
avenues
to
the
house
crowded."
Yorkshire
people
are
as
yielding
to
persuasion
as
they
are
stubborn
against
compulsion.
The
yard
was
clear
in
five
minutes.
"Thank
you,
and
good
bye
to
you,
friends,"
said
Shirley,
as
she
closed
the
gates
on
a
quiet
court.
Now,
let
me
hear
the
most
refined
of
cockneys
presume
to
find
fault
with
Yorkshire
manners.
Taken
as
they
ought
to
be,
the
majority
of
the
lads
and
lasses
of
the
West
Riding
are
gentlemen
and
ladies,
every
inch
of
them.
It
is
only
against
the
weak
affectation
and
futile
pomposity
of
a
would
be
aristocrat
they
turn
mutinous.
Entering
by
the
back
way,
the
young
ladies
passed
through
the
kitchen
(or
house,
as
the
inner
kitchen
is
called)
to
the
hall.
Mrs.
Pryor
came
running
down
the
oak
staircase
to
meet
them.
She
was
all
unnerved;
her
naturally
sanguine
complexion
was
pale;
her
usually
placid,
though
timid,
blue
eye
was
wandering,
unsettled,
alarmed.
She
did
not,
however,
break
out
into
any
exclamations,
or
hurried
narrative
of
what
had
happened.
Her
predominant
feeling
had
been
in
the
course
of
the
night,
and
was
now
this
morning,
a
sense
of
dissatisfaction
with
herself
that
she
could
not
feel
firmer,
cooler,
more
equal
to
the
demands
of
the
occasion.
"You
are
aware,"
she
began
with
a
trembling
voice,
and
yet
the
most
conscientious
anxiety
to
avoid
exaggeration
in
what
she
was
about
to
say,
"that
a
body
of
rioters
has
attacked
Mr.
Moore's
mill
to
night.
We
heard
the
firing
and
confusion
very
plainly
here;
we
none
of
us
slept.
It
was
a
sad
night.
The
house
has
been
in
great
bustle
all
the
morning
with
people
coming
and
going.
The
servants
have
applied
to
me
for
orders
and
directions,
which
I
really
did
not
feel
warranted
in
giving.
Mr.
Moore
has,
I
believe,
sent
up
for
refreshments
for
the
soldiers
and
others
engaged
in
the
defence,
for
some
conveniences
also
for
the
wounded.
I
could
not
undertake
the
responsibility
of
giving
orders
or
taking
measures.
I
fear
delay
may
have
been
injurious
in
some
instances;
but
this
is
not
my
house.
You
were
absent,
my
dear
Miss
Keeldar.
What
could
I
do?"
"Were
no
refreshments
sent?"
asked
Shirley,
while
her
countenance,
hitherto
so
clear,
propitious,
and
quiet,
even
while
she
was
rating
the
milk
fetchers,
suddenly
turned
dark
and
warm.
"I
think
not,
my
dear."
"And
nothing
for
the
wounded
no
linen,
no
wine,
no
bedding?"
"I
think
not.
I
cannot
tell
what
Mrs.
Gill
did;
but
it
seemed
impossible
to
me,
at
the
moment,
to
venture
to
dispose
of
your
property
by
sending
supplies
to
soldiers.
Provisions
for
a
company
of
soldiers
sounds
formidable.
How
many
there
are
I
did
not
ask;
but
I
could
not
think
of
allowing
them
to
pillage
the
house,
as
it
were.
I
intended
to
do
what
was
right,
yet
I
did
not
see
the
case
quite
clearly,
I
own."
"It
lies
in
a
nutshell,
notwithstanding.
These
soldiers
have
