painful
step?"
"My
dear,"
said
Mrs.
Pryor,
"you
are
very
young
to
be
a
governess,
and
not
sufficiently
robust.
The
duties
a
governess
undertakes
are
often
severe."
"And
I
believe
I
want
severe
duties
to
occupy
me."
"Occupy
you!"
cried
Shirley.
"When
are
you
idle?
I
never
saw
a
more
industrious
girl
than
you.
You
are
always
at
work.
Come,"
she
continued
"come
and
sit
by
my
side,
and
take
some
tea
to
refresh
you.
You
don't
care
much
for
my
friendship,
then,
that
you
wish
to
leave
me?"
"Indeed
I
do,
Shirley;
and
I
don't
wish
to
leave
you.
I
shall
never
find
another
friend
so
dear."
At
which
words
Miss
Keeldar
put
her
hand
into
Caroline's
with
an
impulsively
affectionate
movement,
which
was
well
seconded
by
the
expression
of
her
face.
"If
you
think
so,
you
had
better
make
much
of
me,"
she
said,
"and
not
run
away
from
me.
I
hate
to
part
with
those
to
whom
I
am
become
attached.
Mrs.
Pryor
there
sometimes
talks
of
leaving
me,
and
says
I
might
make
a
more
advantageous
connection
than
herself.
I
should
as
soon
think
of
exchanging
an
old
fashioned
mother
for
something
modish
and
stylish.
As
for
you
why,
I
began
to
flatter
myself
we
were
thoroughly
friends;
that
you
liked
Shirley
almost
as
well
as
Shirley
likes
you,
and
she
does
not
stint
her
regard."
"I
do
like
Shirley.
I
like
her
more
and
more
every
day.
But
that
does
not
make
me
strong
or
happy."
"And
would
it
make
you
strong
or
happy
to
go
and
live
as
a
dependent
amongst
utter
strangers?
It
would
not.
And
the
experiment
must
not
be
tried;
I
tell
you
it
would
fail.
It
is
not
in
your
nature
to
bear
the
desolate
life
governesses
generally
lead;
you
would
fall
ill.
I
won't
hear
of
it."
And
Miss
Keeldar
paused,
having
uttered
this
prohibition
very
decidedly.
Soon
she
recommenced,
still
looking
somewhat
courroucee,
"Why,
it
is
my
daily
pleasure
now
to
look
out
for
the
little
cottage
bonnet
and
the
silk
scarf
glancing
through
the
trees
in
the
lane,
and
to
know
that
my
quiet,
shrewd,
thoughtful
companion
and
monitress
is
coming
back
to
me;
that
I
shall
have
her
sitting
in
the
room
to
look
at,
to
talk
to
or
to
let
alone,
as
she
and
I
please.
This
may
be
a
selfish
sort
of
language
I
know
it
is
but
it
is
the
language
which
naturally
rises
to
my
lips,
therefore
I
utter
it."
"I
would
write
to
you,
Shirley."
"And
what
are
letters?
Only
a
sort
of
pis
aller.
Drink
some
tea,
Caroline.
Eat
something
you
eat
nothing.
Laugh
and
be
cheerful,
and
stay
at
home."
Miss
Helstone
shook
her
head
and
sighed.
She
felt
what
difficulty
she
would
have
to
persuade
any
one
to
assist
or
sanction
her
in
making
that
change
in
her
life
which
she
believed
desirable.
Might
she
only
follow
her
own
judgment,
she
thought
she
should
be
able
to
find
