me?
You
had
better
grin
at
your
own
perverseness.
I
see,
however,
you
laugh
at
the
wrong
side
of
your
mouth.
You
have
as
sour
a
look
at
this
moment
as
one
need
wish
to
see."
"I
have
so
quarrelled
with
myself,
Yorke.
I
have
so
kicked
against
the
pricks,
and
struggled
in
a
strait
waistcoat,
and
dislocated
my
wrists
with
wrenching
them
in
handcuffs,
and
battered
my
hard
head
by
driving
it
against
a
harder
wall."
"Ha!
I'm
glad
to
hear
that.
Sharp
exercise
yon!
I
hope
it
has
done
you
good
ta'en
some
of
the
self
conceit
out
of
you?"
"Self
conceit?
What
is
it?
Self
respect,
self
tolerance
even,
what
are
they?
Do
you
sell
the
articles?
Do
you
know
anybody
who
does?
Give
an
indication.
They
would
find
in
me
a
liberal
chapman.
I
would
part
with
my
last
guinea
this
minute
to
buy."
"Is
it
so
with
you,
Robert?
I
find
that
spicy.
I
like
a
man
to
speak
his
mind.
What
has
gone
wrong?"
"The
machinery
of
all
my
nature;
the
whole
enginery
of
this
human
mill;
the
boiler,
which
I
take
to
be
the
heart,
is
fit
to
burst."
"That
suld
be
putten
i'
print;
it's
striking.
It's
almost
blank
verse.
Ye'll
be
jingling
into
poetry
just
e'now.
If
the
afflatus
comes,
give
way,
Robert.
Never
heed
me;
I'll
bear
it
this
whet
[time]."
"Hideous,
abhorrent,
base
blunder!
You
may
commit
in
a
moment
what
you
will
rue
for
years
what
life
cannot
cancel."
"Lad,
go
on.
I
call
it
pie,
nuts,
sugar
candy.
I
like
the
taste
uncommonly.
Go
on.
It
will
do
you
good
to
talk.
The
moor
is
before
us
now,
and
there
is
no
life
for
many
a
mile
round."
"I
will
talk.
I
am
not
ashamed
to
tell.
There
is
a
sort
of
wild
cat
in
my
breast,
and
I
choose
that
you
shall
hear
how
it
can
yell."
"To
me
it
is
music.
What
grand
voices
you
and
Louis
have!
When
Louis
sings
tones
off
like
a
soft,
deep
bell
I've
felt
myself
tremble
again.
The
night
is
still.
It
listens.
It
is
just
leaning
down
to
you,
like
a
black
priest
to
a
blacker
penitent.
Confess,
lad.
Smooth
naught
down.
Be
candid
as
a
convicted,
justified,
sanctified
Methody
at
an
experience
meeting.
Make
yourself
as
wicked
as
Beelzebub.
It
will
ease
your
mind."
"As
mean
as
Mammon,
you
would
say.
Yorke,
if
I
got
off
horseback
and
laid
myself
down
across
the
road,
would
you
have
the
goodness
to
gallop
over
me,
backwards
and
forwards,
about
twenty
times?"
"Wi'
all
the
pleasure
in
life,
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
a
coroner's
inquest."
"Hiram
Yorke,
I
certainly
believed
she
loved
me.
I
have
seen
her
eyes
sparkle
radiantly
when
she
has
found
me
out
in
a
crowd;
she
has
flushed
up
crimson
when
she
has
offered
me
her
hand,
and
said,
'How
do
you
do,
Mr.
Moore?'
"My
name
had
a
magical
influence
over
her.
