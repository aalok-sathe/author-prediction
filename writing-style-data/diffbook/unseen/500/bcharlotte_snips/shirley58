so
secure
of
your
own
intentions?"
"I
suppose
so."
"What
are
they,
Caroline?"
"Only
to
ease
my
mind
by
expressing
for
once
part
of
what
I
think,
and
then
to
make
you
better
satisfied
with
yourself."
"By
assuring
me
that
my
kinswoman
is
my
sincere
friend?"
"Just
so.
I
am
your
sincere
friend,
Robert."
"And
I
am
what
chance
and
change
shall
make
me,
Lina."
"Not
my
enemy,
however?"
The
answer
was
cut
short
by
Sarah
and
her
mistress
entering
the
kitchen
together
in
some
commotion.
They
had
been
improving
the
time
which
Mr.
Moore
and
Miss
Helstone
had
spent
in
dialogue
by
a
short
dispute
on
the
subject
of
"cafe
au
lait,"
which
Sarah
said
was
the
queerest
mess
she
ever
saw,
and
a
waste
of
God's
good
gifts,
as
it
was
"the
nature
of
coffee
to
be
boiled
in
water,"
and
which
mademoiselle
affirmed
to
be
"un
breuvage
royal,"
a
thousand
times
too
good
for
the
mean
person
who
objected
to
it.
The
former
occupants
of
the
kitchen
now
withdrew
into
the
parlour.
Before
Hortense
followed
them
thither,
Caroline
had
only
time
again
to
question,
"Not
my
enemy,
Robert?"
And
Moore,
Quaker
like,
had
replied
with
another
query,
"Could
I
be?"
And
then,
seating
himself
at
the
table,
had
settled
Caroline
at
his
side.
Caroline
scarcely
heard
mademoiselle's
explosion
of
wrath
when
she
rejoined
them;
the
long
declamation
about
the
"conduite
indigne
de
cette
mechante
creature"
sounded
in
her
ear
as
confusedly
as
the
agitated
rattling
of
the
china.
Robert
laughed
a
little
at
it,
in
very
subdued
sort,
and
then,
politely
and
calmly
entreating
his
sister
to
be
tranquil,
assured
her
that
if
it
would
yield
her
any
satisfaction,
she
should
have
her
choice
of
an
attendant
amongst
all
the
girls
in
his
mill.
Only
he
feared
they
would
scarcely
suit
her,
as
they
were
most
of
them,
he
was
informed,
completely
ignorant
of
household
work;
and
pert
and
self
willed
as
Sarah
was,
she
was,
perhaps,
no
worse
than
the
majority
of
the
women
of
her
class.
Mademoiselle
admitted
the
truth
of
this
conjecture:
according
to
her,
"ces
paysannes
anglaises
etaient
tout
insupportables."
What
would
she
not
give
for
some
"bonne
cuisiniere
anversoise,"
with
the
high
cap,
short
petticoat,
and
decent
sabots
proper
to
her
class
something
better,
indeed,
than
an
insolent
coquette
in
a
flounced
gown,
and
absolutely
without
cap!
(For
Sarah,
it
appears,
did
not
partake
the
opinion
of
St.
Paul
that
"it
is
a
shame
for
a
woman
to
go
with
her
head
uncovered;"
but,
holding
rather
a
contrary
doctrine,
resolutely
refused
to
imprison
in
linen
or
muslin
the
plentiful
tresses
of
her
yellow
hair,
which
it
was
her
wont
to
fasten
up
smartly
with
a
comb
behind,
and
on
Sundays
to
wear
curled
in
front.)
"Shall
I
try
and
get
you
an
Antwerp
girl?"
asked
Mr.
Moore,
who,
stern
in
public,
was
on
the
whole
very
kind
in
private.
"Merci
du
cadeau!"
was
the
answer.
"An
Antwerp
girl
would
not
stay
here
