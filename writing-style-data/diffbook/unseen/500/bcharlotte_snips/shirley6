good
Churchman,

"
By
way
of
finish
to
this
sentence,
he
passed
through
the
inner
door,
drew
it
after
him,
and
mounted
the
stair.
Again
he
listened
a
few
minutes
when
he
arrived
at
the
upper
room.
Making
entrance
without
warning,
he
stood
before
the
curates.
And
they
were
silent;
they
were
transfixed;
and
so
was
the
invader.
He
a
personage
short
of
stature,
but
straight
of
port,
and
bearing
on
broad
shoulders
a
hawk's
head,
beak,
and
eye,
the
whole
surmounted
by
a
Rehoboam,
or
shovel
hat,
which
he
did
not
seem
to
think
it
necessary
to
lift
or
remove
before
the
presence
in
which
he
then
stood
he
folded
his
arms
on
his
chest
and
surveyed
his
young
friends,
if
friends
they
were,
much
at
his
leisure.
"What!"
he
began,
delivering
his
words
in
a
voice
no
longer
nasal,
but
deep
more
than
deep
a
voice
made
purposely
hollow
and
cavernous
"what!
has
the
miracle
of
Pentecost
been
renewed?
Have
the
cloven
tongues
come
down
again?
Where
are
they?
The
sound
filled
the
whole
house
just
now.
I
heard
the
seventeen
languages
in
full
action:
Parthians,
and
Medes,
and
Elamites,
the
dwellers
in
Mesopotamia,
and
in
Judea,
and
Cappadocia,
in
Pontus
and
Asia,
Phrygia
and
Pamphylia,
in
Egypt
and
in
the
parts
of
Libya
about
Cyrene,
strangers
of
Rome,
Jews
and
proselytes,
Cretes
and
Arabians;
every
one
of
these
must
have
had
its
representative
in
this
room
two
minutes
since."
"I
beg
your
pardon,
Mr.
Helstone,"
began
Mr.
Donne;
"take
a
seat,
pray,
sir.
Have
a
glass
of
wine?"
His
civilities
received
no
answer.
The
falcon
in
the
black
coat
proceeded,
"What
do
I
talk
about
the
gift
of
tongues?
Gift,
indeed!
I
mistook
the
chapter,
and
book,
and
Testament
gospel
for
law,
Acts
for
Genesis,
the
city
of
Jerusalem
for
the
plain
of
Shinar.
It
was
no
gift
but
the
confusion
of
tongues
which
has
gabbled
me
deaf
as
a
post.
You,
apostles?
What!
you
three?
Certainly
not;
three
presumptuous
Babylonish
masons
neither
more
nor
less!"
"I
assure
you,
sir,
we
were
only
having
a
little
chat
together
over
a
glass
of
wine
after
a
friendly
dinner
settling
the
Dissenters!"
"Oh!
settling
the
Dissenters,
were
you?
Was
Malone
settling
the
Dissenters?
It
sounded
to
me
much
more
like
settling
his
co
apostles.
You
were
quarrelling
together,
making
almost
as
much
noise
you
three
alone
as
Moses
Barraclough,
the
preaching
tailor,
and
all
his
hearers
are
making
in
the
Methodist
chapel
down
yonder,
where
they
are
in
the
thick
of
a
revival.
I
know
whose
fault
it
is.
It
is
yours,
Malone."
"Mine,
sir?"
"Yours,
sir.
Donne
and
Sweeting
were
quiet
before
you
came,
and
would
be
quiet
if
you
were
gone.
I
wish,
when
you
crossed
the
Channel,
you
had
left
your
Irish
habits
behind
you.
