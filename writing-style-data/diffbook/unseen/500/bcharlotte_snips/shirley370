way.
My
questions
must
be
answered.
I
will
have
clear,
satisfactory
replies.
I
am
not
to
be
trifled
with.
(Silence.)
"It
is
a
strange
and
an
extraordinary
thing
a
very
singular
a
most
odd
thing!
I
thought
all
was
right,
knew
no
other;
and
there
the
family
are
gone!"
"I
suppose,
sir,
they
had
a
right
to
go."
"Sir
Philip
is
gone!"
(with
emphasis).
Shirley
raised
her
brows.
"Bon
voyage!"
said
she.
"This
will
not
do;
this
must
be
altered,
ma'am."
He
drew
his
chair
forward;
he
pushed
it
back;
he
looked
perfectly
incensed,
and
perfectly
helpless.
"Come,
come
now,
uncle,"
expostulated
Shirley,
"do
not
begin
to
fret
and
fume,
or
we
shall
make
no
sense
of
the
business.
Ask
me
what
you
want
to
know.
I
am
as
willing
to
come
to
an
explanation
as
you.
I
promise
you
truthful
replies."
"I
want
I
demand
to
know,
Miss
Keeldar,
whether
Sir
Philip
has
made
you
an
offer?"
"He
has."
"You
avow
it?"
"I
avow
it.
But
now,
go
on.
Consider
that
point
settled."
"He
made
you
an
offer
that
night
we
dined
at
the
priory?"
"It
is
enough
to
say
that
he
made
it.
Go
on."
"He
proposed
in
the
recess
in
the
room
that
used
to
be
a
picture
gallery
that
Sir
Monckton
converted
into
it
saloon?"
No
answer.
"You
were
both
examining
a
cabinet.
I
saw
it
all.
My
sagacity
was
not
at
fault
it
never
is.
Subsequently
you
received
a
letter
from
him.
On
what
subject
of
what
nature
were
the
contents?"
"No
matter."
"Ma'am,
is
that
the
way
in
which
you
speak
to
me?"
Shirley's
foot
tapped
quick
on
the
carpet.
"There
you
sit,
silent
and
sullen
you
who
promised
truthful
replies."
"Sir,
I
have
answered
you
thus
far.
Proceed."
"I
should
like
to
see
that
letter."
"You
cannot
see
it."
"I
must
and
shall,
ma'am;
I
am
your
guardian."
"Having
ceased
to
be
a
ward,
I
have
no
guardian."
"Ungrateful
being!
Reared
by
me
as
my
own
daughter
"
"Once
more,
uncle,
have
the
kindness
to
keep
to
the
point.
Let
us
both
remain
cool.
For
my
part,
I
do
not
wish
to
get
into
a
passion;
but,
you
know,
once
drive
me
beyond
certain
bounds,
I
care
little
what
I
say
I
am
not
then
soon
checked.
Listen!
You
have
asked
me
whether
Sir
Philip
made
me
an
offer.
That
question
is
answered.
What
do
you
wish
to
know
next?"
"I
desire
to
know
whether
you
accepted
or
refused
him,
and
know
it
I
will."
"Certainly,
you
ought
to
know
it.
I
refused
him."
"Refused
him!
You
you,
Shirley
Keeldar,
refused
Sir
Philip
Nunnely?"
"I
did."
The
poor
gentleman
bounced
from
his
chair,
and
first
rushed
and
then
trotted
through
the
room.
"There
it
is!
There
it
is!
There
it
is!"
"Sincerely
speaking,
I
am
sorry,
uncle,
you
are
so
disappointed."
Concession,
contrition,
never
do
any
good
with
some
people.
Instead
of
softening
and
conciliating,
they
but
embolden
and
harden
them.
Of
that
