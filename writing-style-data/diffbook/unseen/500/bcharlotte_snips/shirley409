niece.
Shirley,
who
could
never
find
it
in
her
heart
to
be
or
to
seem
inhospitable
(except
in
the
single
instance
of
Mr.
Donne),
begged
the
whole
party
to
stay
a
little
longer.
She
begged
in
such
earnest
it
was
evident
she
wished
it
for
some
reason.
They
took
her
at
her
word.
Indeed,
the
uncle
could
not
bring
himself
to
leave
her
quite
unwatched
at
full
liberty
to
marry
Robert
Moore
as
soon
as
that
gentleman
should
be
able
(Mr.
Sympson
piously
prayed
this
might
never
be
the
case)
to
reassert
his
supposed
pretensions
to
her
hand.
They
all
stayed.
In
his
first
rage
against
all
the
house
of
Moore,
Mr.
Sympson
had
so
conducted
himself
towards
Mr.
Louis
that
that
gentleman
patient
of
labour
or
suffering,
but
intolerant
of
coarse
insolence
had
promptly
resigned
his
post,
and
could
now
be
induced
to
resume
and
retain
it
only
till
such
time
as
the
family
should
quit
Yorkshire.
Mrs.
Sympson's
entreaties
prevailed
with
him
thus
far;
his
own
attachment
to
his
pupil
constituted
an
additional
motive
for
concession;
and
probably
he
had
a
third
motive,
stronger
than
either
of
the
other
two.
Probably
he
would
have
found
it
very
hard
indeed
to
leave
Fieldhead
just
now.
Things
went
on
for
some
time
pretty
smoothly.
Miss
Keeldar's
health
was
re
established;
her
spirits
resumed
their
flow.
Moore
had
found
means
to
relieve
her
from
every
nervous
apprehension;
and,
indeed,
from
the
moment
of
giving
him
her
confidence,
every
fear
seemed
to
have
taken
wing.
Her
heart
became
as
lightsome,
her
manner
as
careless,
as
those
of
a
little
child,
that,
thoughtless
of
its
own
life
or
death,
trusts
all
responsibility
to
its
parents.
He
and
William
Farren
through
whose
medium
he
made
inquiries
concerning
the
state
of
Pheabe
agreed
in
asserting
that
the
dog
was
not
mad,
that
it
was
only
ill
usage
which
had
driven
her
from
home;
for
it
was
proved
that
her
master
was
in
the
frequent
habit
of
chastising
her
violently.
Their
assertion
might
or
might
not
be
true.
The
groom
and
gamekeeper
affirmed
to
the
contrary
both
asserting
that,
if
hers
was
not
a
clear
case
of
hydrophobia,
there
was
no
such
disease.
But
to
this
evidence
Louis
Moore
turned
an
incredulous
ear.
He
reported
to
Shirley
only
what
was
encouraging.
She
believed
him;
and,
right
or
wrong,
it
is
certain
that
in
her
case
the
bite
proved
innocuous.
November
passed;
December
came.
The
Sympsons
were
now
really
departing.
It
was
incumbent
on
them
to
be
at
home
by
Christmas.
Their
packages
were
preparing;
they
were
to
leave
in
a
few
days.
One
winter
evening,
during
the
last
week
of
their
stay,
Louis
Moore
again
took
out
his
little
blank
book,
and
discoursed
with
it
as
follows:
"She
is
lovelier
than
ever.
Since
that
little
cloud
was
dispelled
all
the
temporary
waste
and
wanness
have
vanished.
It
was
marvellous
to
see
how
soon
the
magical
energy
of
youth
raised
her
elastic
and
revived
her
blooming.
"After
