all
cherish
humility
I,
as
you,
my
young
friends;
and
we
may
well
do
it
when
we
look
into
our
own
hearts,
and
see
there
temptations,
inconsistencies,
propensities,
even
we
blush
to
recognize.
And
it
is
not
youth,
nor
good
looks,
nor
grace,
nor
any
gentle
outside
charm
which
makes
either
beauty
or
goodness
in
God's
eyes.
Young
ladies,
when
your
mirror
or
men's
tongues
flatter
you,
remember
that,
in
the
sight
of
her
Maker,
Mary
Ann
Ainley
a
woman
whom
neither
glass
nor
lips
have
ever
panegyrized
is
fairer
and
better
than
either
of
you.
She
is
indeed,"
he
added,
after
a
pause
"she
is
indeed.
You
young
things,
wrapt
up
in
yourselves
and
in
earthly
hopes,
scarcely
live
as
Christ
lived.
Perhaps
you
cannot
do
it
yet,
while
existence
is
so
sweet
and
earth
so
smiling
to
you;
it
would
be
too
much
to
expect.
She,
with
meek
heart
and
due
reverence,
treads
close
in
her
Redeemer's
steps."
Here
the
harsh
voice
of
Donne
broke
in
on
the
mild
tones
of
Mr.
Hall.
"Ahem!"
he
began,
clearing
his
throat
evidently
for
a
speech
of
some
importance
"ahem!
Miss
Keeldar,
your
attention
an
instant,
if
you
please."
"Well,"
said
Shirley
nonchalantly,
"what
is
it?
I
listen.
All
of
me
is
ear
that
is
not
eye."
"I
hope
part
of
you
is
hand
also,"
returned
Donne,
in
his
vulgarly
presumptuous
and
familiar
style,
"and
part
purse.
It
is
to
the
hand
and
purse
I
propose
to
appeal.
I
came
here
this
morning
with
a
view
to
beg
of
you
"
"You
should
have
gone
to
Mrs.
Gill;
she
is
my
almoner."
"To
beg
of
you
a
subscription
to
a
school.
I
and
Dr.
Boultby
intend
to
erect
one
in
the
hamlet
of
Ecclefigg,
which
is
under
our
vicarage
of
Whinbury.
The
Baptists
have
got
possession
of
it.
They
have
a
chapel
there,
and
we
want
to
dispute
the
ground."
"But
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
Ecclefigg.
I
possess
no
property
there."
"What
does
that
signify?
You're
a
churchwoman,
ain't
you?"
"Admirable
creature!"
muttered
Shirley,
under
her
breath.
"Exquisite
address!
Fine
style!
What
raptures
he
excites
in
me!"
Then
aloud,
"I
am
a
churchwoman,
certainly."
"Then
you
can't
refuse
to
contribute
in
this
case.
The
population
of
Ecclefigg
are
a
parcel
of
brutes;
we
want
to
civilize
them."
"Who
is
to
be
the
missionary?"
"Myself,
probably."
"You
won't
fail
through
lack
of
sympathy
with
your
flock."
"I
hope
not
I
expect
success;
but
we
must
have
money.
There
is
the
paper.
Pray
give
a
handsome
sum."
When
asked
for
money,
Shirley
rarely
held
back.
She
put
down
her
name
for
5.
After
the
300
she
had
lately
given,
and
the
many
smaller
sums
she
was
giving
constantly,
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
at
present
afford.
Donne
looked
at
it,
declared
the
subscription
"shabby,"
and
clamorously
demanded
more.
Miss
Keeldar
flushed
up
with
some
indignation
and
more
astonishment.
"At
present
I
shall
give
no
more,"
said
she.
"Not
give
