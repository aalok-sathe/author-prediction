the
pate
generally
approved,
bon
comme
le
pain
daily
bread
for
the
most
fastidious,
good
for
the
infant
and
the
aged,
nourishing
for
the
poor,
wholesome
for
the
rich.
Shirley,
in
spite
of
her
whims
and
oddities,
her
dodges
and
delays,
has
an
infatuated
fondness
for
him.
She
will
one
day
see
him
as
universally
beloved
as
even
she
could
wish.
He
will
also
be
universally
esteemed,
considered,
consulted,
depended
on
too
much
so.
His
advice
will
be
always
judicious,
his
help
always
good
natured.
Ere
long
both
will
be
in
inconvenient
request.
He
will
have
to
impose
restrictions.
As
for
me,
if
I
succeed
as
I
intend
to
do,
my
success
will
add
to
his
and
Shirley's
income.
I
can
double
the
value
of
their
mill
property.
I
can
line
yonder
barren
Hollow
with
lines
of
cottages
and
rows
of
cottage
gardens
"
"Robert!
And
root
up
the
copse?"
"The
copse
shall
be
firewood
ere
five
years
elapse.
The
beautiful
wild
ravine
shall
be
a
smooth
descent;
the
green
natural
terrace
shall
be
a
paved
street.
There
shall
be
cottages
in
the
dark
ravine,
and
cottages
on
the
lonely
slopes.
The
rough
pebbled
track
shall
be
an
even,
firm,
broad,
black,
sooty
road,
bedded
with
the
cinders
from
my
mill;
and
my
mill,
Caroline
my
mill
shall
fill
its
present
yard."
"Horrible!
You
will
change
our
blue
hill
country
air
into
the
Stilbro'
smoke
atmosphere."
"I
will
pour
the
waters
of
Pactolus
through
the
valley
of
Briarfield."
"I
like
the
beck
a
thousand
times
better."
"I
will
get
an
Act
for
enclosing
Nunnely
Common,
and
parcelling
it
out
into
farms."
"Stilbro'
Moor,
however,
defies
you,
thank
Heaven!
What
can
you
grow
in
Bilberry
Moss?
What
will
flourish
on
Rushedge?"
"Caroline,
the
houseless,
the
starving,
the
unemployed
shall
come
to
Hollow's
Mill
from
far
and
near;
and
Joe
Scott
shall
give
them
work,
and
Louis
Moore,
Esq.,
shall
let
them
a
tenement,
and
Mrs.
Gill
shall
mete
them
a
portion
till
the
first
pay
day."
She
smiled
up
in
his
face.
"Such
a
Sunday
school
as
you
will
have,
Cary!
such
collections
as
you
will
get!
such
a
day
school
as
you
and
Shirley
and
Miss
Ainley
will
have
to
manage
between
you!
The
mill
shall
find
salaries
for
a
master
and
mistress,
and
the
squire
or
the
clothier
shall
give
a
treat
once
a
quarter."
She
mutely
offered
a
kiss
an
offer
taken
unfair
advantage
of,
to
the
extortion
of
about
a
hundred
kisses.
"Extravagant
day
dreams,"
said
Moore,
with
a
sigh
and
smile,
"yet
perhaps
we
may
realize
some
of
them.
Meantime,
the
dew
is
falling.
Mrs.
Moore,
I
shall
take
you
in."
It
is
August.
The
bells
clash
out
again,
not
only
through
Yorkshire,
but
through
England.
From
Spain
the
voice
of
a
trumpet
has
sounded
long;
it
now
waxes
louder
and
louder;
it
proclaims
Salamanca
won.
This
night
is
Briarfield
to
be
illuminated.
On
this
day
the
Fieldhead
tenantry
dine
together;
the
Hollow's
Mill
workpeople
will
