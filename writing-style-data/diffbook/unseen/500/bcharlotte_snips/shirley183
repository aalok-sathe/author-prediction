should
try
to
get
additional
subscriptions,
and
to
form
a
fund;
but
first
she
must
consult
the
clergy.
Yes,
on
that
point
she
was
peremptory.
Mr.
Helstone,
Dr.
Boultby,
Mr.
Hall,
must
be
consulted
(for
not
only
must
Briarfield
be
relieved,
but
Whinbury
and
Nunnely).
It
would,
she
averred,
be
presumption
in
her
to
take
a
single
step
unauthorized
by
them.
The
clergy
were
sacred
beings
in
Miss
Ainley's
eyes;
no
matter
what
might
be
the
insignificance
of
the
individual,
his
station
made
him
holy.
The
very
curates
who,
in
their
trivial
arrogance,
were
hardly
worthy
to
tie
her
patten
strings,
or
carry
her
cotton
umbrella,
or
check
woollen
shawl
she,
in
her
pure,
sincere
enthusiasm,
looked
upon
as
sucking
saints.
No
matter
how
clearly
their
little
vices
and
enormous
absurdities
were
pointed
out
to
her,
she
could
not
see
them;
she
was
blind
to
ecclesiastical
defects;
the
white
surplice
covered
a
multitude
of
sins.
Shirley,
knowing
this
harmless
infatuation
on
the
part
of
her
recently
chosen
prime
minister,
stipulated
expressly
that
the
curates
were
to
have
no
voice
in
the
disposal
of
the
money,
that
their
meddling
fingers
were
not
to
be
inserted
into
the
pie.
The
rectors,
of
course,
must
be
paramount,
and
they
might
be
trusted.
They
had
some
experience,
some
sagacity,
and
Mr.
Hall,
at
least,
had
sympathy
and
loving
kindness
for
his
fellow
men;
but
as
for
the
youth
under
them,
they
must
be
set
aside,
kept
down,
and
taught
that
subordination
and
silence
best
became
their
years
and
capacity.
It
was
with
some
horror
Miss
Ainley
heard
this
language.
Caroline,
however,
interposing
with
a
mild
word
or
two
in
praise
of
Mr
Sweeting,
calmed
her
again.
Sweeting
was,
indeed,
her
own
favourite.
She
endeavoured
to
respect
Messrs.
Malone
and
Donne,
but
the
slices
of
sponge
cake
and
glasses
of
cowslip
or
primrose
wine
she
had
at
different
times
administered
to
Sweeting,
when
he
came
to
see
her
in
her
little
cottage,
were
ever
offered
with
sentiments
of
truly
motherly
regard.
The
same
innocuous
collation
she
had
once
presented
to
Malone;
but
that
personage
evinced
such
open
scorn
of
the
offering,
she
had
never
ventured
to
renew
it.
To
Donne
she
always
served
the
treat,
and
was
happy
to
see
his
approbation
of
it
proved
beyond
a
doubt
by
the
fact
of
his
usually
eating
two
pieces
of
cake,
and
putting
a
third
in
his
pocket.
Indefatigable
in
her
exertions
where
good
was
to
be
done,
Miss
Ainley
would
immediately
have
set
out
on
a
walk
of
ten
miles
round
to
the
three
rectors,
in
order
to
show
her
plan,
and
humbly
solicit
their
approval;
but
Miss
Keeldar
interdicted
this,
and
proposed,
as
an
amendment,
to
collect
the
clergy
in
a
small
select
reunion
that
evening
at
Fieldhead.
Miss
Ainley
was
to
meet
them,
and
the
plan
was
to
be
discussed
in
full
privy
council.
Shirley
managed
to
get
the
senior
priesthood
together
accordingly,
and
before
the
old
maid's
arrival,
she
had,
further,
talked
all
