afternoon
of
bed.
This
would
accommodate
him
perfectly.
The
collision
duly
took
place
in
the
hall.
A
dry
laugh,
an
insulting
sneer,
a
contemptuous
taunt,
met
by
a
nonchalant
but
most
cutting
reply,
were
the
signals.
They
rushed
at
it.
Martin,
who
usually
made
little
noise
on
these
occasions,
made
a
great
deal
now.
In
flew
the
servants,
Mrs.
Yorke,
Miss
Moore.
No
female
hand
could
separate
them.
Mr.
Yorke
was
summoned.
"Sons,"
said
he,
"one
of
you
must
leave
my
roof
if
this
occurs
again.
I
will
have
no
Cain
and
Abel
strife
here."
Martin
now
allowed
himself
to
be
taken
off.
He
had
been
hurt;
he
was
the
youngest
and
slightest.
He
was
quite
cool,
in
no
passion;
he
even
smiled,
content
that
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
labour
he
had
set
himself
was
over.
Once
he
seemed
to
flag
in
the
course
of
the
morning.
"It
is
not
worth
while
to
bother
myself
for
that
Caroline,"
he
remarked.
But
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
he
was
again
in
the
dining
room,
looking
at
the
head
with
dishevelled
tresses,
and
eyes
turbid
with
despair.
"Yes,"
he
said,
"I
made
her
sob,
shudder,
almost
faint.
I'll
see
her
smile
before
I've
done
with
her;
besides,
I
want
to
outwit
all
these
womenites."
Directly
after
dinner
Mrs.
Yorke
fulfilled
her
son's
calculation
by
withdrawing
to
her
chamber.
Now
for
Hortense.
That
lady
was
just
comfortably
settled
to
stocking
mending
in
the
back
parlour,
when
Martin
laying
down
a
book
which,
stretched
on
the
sofa
(he
was
still
indisposed,
according
to
his
own
account),
he
had
been
perusing
in
all
the
voluptuous
ease
of
a
yet
callow
pacha
lazily
introduced
some
discourse
about
Sarah,
the
maid
at
the
Hollow.
In
the
course
of
much
verbal
meandering
he
insinuated
information
that
this
damsel
was
said
to
have
three
suitors
Frederic
Murgatroyd,
Jeremiah
Pighills,
and
John
of
Mally's
of
Hannah's
of
Deb's;
and
that
Miss
Mann
had
affirmed
she
knew
for
a
fact
that,
now
the
girl
was
left
in
sole
charge
of
the
cottage,
she
often
had
her
swains
to
meals,
and
entertained
them
with
the
best
the
house
afforded.
It
needed
no
more.
Hortense
could
not
have
lived
another
hour
without
betaking
herself
to
the
scene
of
these
nefarious
transactions,
and
inspecting
the
state
of
matters
in
person.
Mrs.
Horsfall
remained.
Martin,
master
of
the
field
now,
extracted
from
his
mother's
work
basket
a
bunch
of
keys;
with
these
he
opened
the
sideboard
cupboard,
produced
thence
a
black
bottle
and
a
small
glass,
placed
them
on
the
table,
nimbly
mounted
the
stairs,
made
for
Mr.
Moore's
door,
tapped;
the
nurse
opened.
"If
you
please,
ma'am,
you
are
invited
to
step
into
the
back
parlour
and
take
some
refreshment.
You
will
not
be
disturbed;
the
family
are
out."
He
watched
her
down;
he
watched
her
in;
himself
shut
the
door.
He
knew
she
was
safe.
The
hard
work
was
done;
now
for
the
pleasure.
He
snatched
his
cap,
and
away
