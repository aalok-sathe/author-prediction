slow
to
make
fresh
acquaintance.
She
was
always
held
back
by
the
idea
that
people
could
not
want
her,
that
she
could
not
amuse
them;
and
a
brilliant,
happy,
youthful
creature
like
the
heiress
of
Fieldhead
seemed
to
her
too
completely
independent
of
society
so
uninteresting
as
hers
ever
to
find
it
really
welcome.
Shirley
might
be
brilliant,
and
probably
happy
likewise,
but
no
one
is
independent
of
genial
society;
and
though
in
about
a
month
she
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
most
of
the
families
round,
and
was
on
quite
free
and
easy
terms
with
all
the
Misses
Sykes,
and
all
the
Misses
Pearson,
and
the
two
superlative
Misses
Wynne
of
Walden
Hall,
yet,
it
appeared,
she
found
none
amongst
them
very
genial:
she
fraternized
with
none
of
them,
to
use
her
own
words.
If
she
had
had
the
bliss
to
be
really
Shirley
Keeldar,
Esq.,
lord
of
the
manor
of
Briarfield,
there
was
not
a
single
fair
one
in
this
and
the
two
neighbouring
parishes
whom
she
should
have
felt
disposed
to
request
to
become
Mrs.
Keeldar,
lady
of
the
manor.
This
declaration
she
made
to
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
received
it
very
quietly,
as
she
did
most
of
her
pupil's
off
hand
speeches,
responding,
"My
dear,
do
not
allow
that
habit
of
alluding
to
yourself
as
a
gentleman
to
be
confirmed.
It
is
a
strange
one.
Those
who
do
not
know
you,
hearing
you
speak
thus,
would
think
you
affected
masculine
manners."
Shirley
never
laughed
at
her
former
governess;
even
the
little
formalities
and
harmless
peculiarities
of
that
lady
were
respectable
in
her
eyes.
Had
it
been
otherwise,
she
would
have
proved
herself
a
weak
character
at
once;
for
it
is
only
the
weak
who
make
a
butt
of
quiet
worth.
Therefore
she
took
her
remonstrance
in
silence.
She
stood
quietly
near
the
window,
looking
at
the
grand
cedar
on
her
lawn
watching
a
bird
on
one
of
its
lower
boughs.
Presently
she
began
to
chirrup
to
the
bird;
soon
her
chirrup
grew
clearer;
ere
long
she
was
whistling;
the
whistle
struck
into
a
tune,
and
very
sweetly
and
deftly
it
was
executed.
"My
dear!"
expostulated
Mrs.
Pryor.
"Was
I
whistling?"
said
Shirley.
"I
forgot.
I
beg
your
pardon,
ma'am.
I
had
resolved
to
take
care
not
to
whistle
before
you."
"But,
Miss
Keeldar,
where
did
you
learn
to
whistle?
You
must
have
got
the
habit
since
you
came
down
into
Yorkshire.
I
never
knew
you
guilty
of
it
before."
"Oh!
I
learned
to
whistle
a
long
while
ago."
"Who
taught
you?"
"No
one.
I
took
it
up
by
listening,
and
I
had
laid
it
down
again.
But
lately,
yesterday
evening,
as
I
was
coming
up
our
lane,
I
heard
a
gentleman
whistling
that
very
tune
in
the
field
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge,
and
that
reminded
me."
"What
gentleman
was
it?"
"We
have
only
one
gentleman
in
this
region,
ma'am,
and
that
is
Mr.
Moore
at
least
he
is
the
only
gentleman
who
is
not
