gave
herself
up
to
a
sort
of
brain
lethargy
closing
her
eyes
and
depressing
her
head
caused
by
what
seemed
to
her
the
unmeaning
hum
around
her,
the
inharmonious,
tasteless
rattle
of
the
piano
keys,
the
squeaking
and
gasping
notes
of
the
flute,
the
laughter
and
mirth
of
her
uncle,
and
Hannah,
and
Mary,
she
could
not
tell
whence
originating,
for
she
heard
nothing
comic
or
gleeful
in
their
discourse;
and
more
than
all,
by
the
interminable
gossip
of
Mrs.
Sykes
murmured
close
at
her
ear,
gossip
which
rang
the
changes
on
four
subjects
her
own
health
and
that
of
the
various
members
of
her
family;
the
missionary
and
Jew
baskets
and
their
contents;
the
late
meeting
at
Nunnely,
and
one
which
was
expected
to
come
off
next
week
at
Whinbury.
Tired
at
length
to
exhaustion,
she
embraced
the
opportunity
of
Mr.
Sweeting
coming
up
to
speak
to
Mrs.
Sykes
to
slip
quietly
out
of
the
apartment,
and
seek
a
moment's
respite
in
solitude.
She
repaired
to
the
dining
room,
where
the
clear
but
now
low
remnant
of
a
fire
still
burned
in
the
grate.
The
place
was
empty
and
quiet,
glasses
and
decanters
were
cleared
from
the
table,
the
chairs
were
put
back
in
their
places,
all
was
orderly.
Caroline
sank
into
her
uncle's
large
easy
chair,
half
shut
her
eyes,
and
rested
herself
rested
at
least
her
limbs,
her
senses,
her
hearing,
her
vision
weary
with
listening
to
nothing,
and
gazing
on
vacancy.
As
to
her
mind,
that
flew
directly
to
the
Hollow.
It
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
parlour
there,
then
it
passed
to
the
counting
house,
and
wondered
which
spot
was
blessed
by
the
presence
of
Robert.
It
so
happened
that
neither
locality
had
that
honour;
for
Robert
was
half
a
mile
away
from
both,
and
much
nearer
to
Caroline
than
her
deadened
spirit
suspected.
He
was
at
this
moment
crossing
the
churchyard,
approaching
the
rectory
garden
gate
not,
however,
coming
to
see
his
cousin,
but
intent
solely
on
communicating
a
brief
piece
of
intelligence
to
the
rector.
Yes,
Caroline;
you
hear
the
wire
of
the
bell
vibrate;
it
rings
again
for
the
fifth
time
this
afternoon.
You
start,
and
you
are
certain
now
that
this
must
be
he
of
whom
you
dream.
Why
you
are
so
certain
you
cannot
explain
to
yourself,
but
you
know
it.
You
lean
forward,
listening
eagerly
as
Fanny
opens
the
door.
Right!
That
is
the
voice
low,
with
the
slight
foreign
accent,
but
so
sweet,
as
you
fancy.
You
half
rise.
"Fanny
will
tell
him
Mr.
Helstone
is
with
company,
and
then
he
will
go
away."
Oh!
she
cannot
let
him
go.
In
spite
of
herself,
in
spite
of
her
reason,
she
walks
half
across
the
room;
she
stands
ready
to
dart
out
in
case
the
step
should
retreat;
but
he
enters
the
passage.
"Since
your
master
is
engaged,"
he
says,
"just
show
me
into
the
dining
room.
Bring
me
pen
and
ink.
I
will
write
a
short
note
