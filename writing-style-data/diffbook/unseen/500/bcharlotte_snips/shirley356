that
Moore
dared
not
come
to
Yorkshire;
he
knew
his
life
was
not
worth
an
hour's
purchase
if
he
did.
"I'll
tell
him
that,"
said
Mr.
Yorke,
when
his
foreman
mentioned
the
rumour;
"and
if
that
does
not
bring
him
home
full
gallop,
nothing
will."
Either
that
or
some
other
motive
prevailed
at
last
to
recall
him.
He
announced
to
Joe
Scott
the
day
he
should
arrive
at
Stilbro',
desiring
his
hackney
to
be
sent
to
the
George
for
his
accommodation;
and
Joe
Scott
having
informed
Mr.
Yorke,
that
gentleman
made
it
in
his
way
to
meet
him.
It
was
market
day.
Moore
arrived
in
time
to
take
his
usual
place
at
the
market
dinner.
As
something
of
a
stranger,
and
as
a
man
of
note
and
action,
the
assembled
manufacturers
received
him
with
a
certain
distinction.
Some,
who
in
public
would
scarcely
have
dared
to
acknowledge
his
acquaintance,
lest
a
little
of
the
hate
and
vengeance
laid
up
in
store
for
him
should
perchance
have
fallen
on
them,
in
private
hailed
him
as
in
some
sort
their
champion.
When
the
wine
had
circulated,
their
respect
would
have
kindled
to
enthusiasm
had
not
Moore's
unshaken
nonchalance
held
it
in
a
damp,
low,
smouldering
state.
Mr.
Yorke,
the
permanent
president
of
these
dinners,
witnessed
his
young
friend's
bearing
with
exceeding
complacency.
If
one
thing
could
stir
his
temper
or
excite
his
contempt
more
than
another,
it
was
to
see
a
man
befooled
by
flattery
or
elate
with
popularity.
If
one
thing
smoothed,
soothed,
and
charmed
him
especially,
it
was
the
spectacle
of
a
public
character
incapable
of
relishing
his
publicity
incapable,
I
say.
Disdain
would
but
have
incensed;
it
was
indifference
that
appeased
his
rough
spirit.
Robert,
leaning
back
in
his
chair,
quiet
and
almost
surly,
while
the
clothiers
and
blanket
makers
vaunted
his
prowess
and
rehearsed
his
deeds
many
of
them
interspersing
their
flatteries
with
coarse
invectives
against
the
operative
class
was
a
delectable
sight
for
Mr.
Yorke.
His
heart
tingled
with
the
pleasing
conviction
that
these
gross
eulogiums
shamed
Moore
deeply,
and
made
him
half
scorn
himself
and
his
work.
On
abuse,
on
reproach,
on
calumny,
it
is
easy
to
smile;
but
painful
indeed
is
the
panegyric
of
those
we
contemn.
Often
had
Moore
gazed
with
a
brilliant
countenance
over
howling
crowds
from
a
hostile
hustings.
He
had
breasted
the
storm
of
unpopularity
with
gallant
bearing
and
soul
elate;
but
he
drooped
his
head
under
the
half
bred
tradesmen's
praise,
and
shrank
chagrined
before
their
congratulations.
Yorke
could
not
help
asking
him
how
he
liked
his
supporters,
and
whether
he
did
not
think
they
did
honour
to
his
cause.
"But
it
is
a
pity,
lad,"
he
added,
"that
you
did
not
hang
these
four
samples
of
the
unwashed.
If
you
had
managed
that
feat,
the
gentry
here
would
have
riven
the
horses
out
of
the
coach,
yoked
to
a
score
of
asses,
and
drawn
you
into
Stilbro'
like
a
conquering
general."
Moore
soon
forsook
the
wine,
broke
from
the
