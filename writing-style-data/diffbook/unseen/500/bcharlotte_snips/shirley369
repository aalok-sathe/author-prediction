the
delicious
worldly
fuss
should
pompously
begin.
At
last
there
came
a
letter.
He
himself
handed
it
to
Miss
Keeldar
out
of
the
bag.
He
knew
the
handwriting;
he
knew
the
crest
on
the
seal.
He
did
not
see
it
opened
and
read,
for
Shirley
took
it
to
her
own
room;
nor
did
he
see
it
answered,
for
she
wrote
her
reply
shut
up,
and
was
very
long
about
it
the
best
part
of
a
day.
He
questioned
her
whether
it
was
answered;
she
responded,
"Yes."
Again
he
waited
waited
in
silence,
absolutely
not
daring
to
speak,
kept
mute
by
something
in
Shirley's
face
a
very
awful
something
inscrutable
to
him
as
the
writing
on
the
wall
to
Belshazzar.
He
was
moved
more
than
once
to
call
Daniel,
in
the
person
of
Louis
Moore,
and
to
ask
an
interpretation;
but
his
dignity
forbade
the
familiarity.
Daniel
himself,
perhaps,
had
his
own
private
difficulties
connected
with
that
baffling
bit
of
translation;
he
looked
like
a
student
for
whom
grammars
are
blank
and
dictionaries
dumb.
Mr.
Sympson
had
been
out,
to
while
away
an
anxious
hour
in
the
society
of
his
friends
at
De
Walden
Hall.
He
returned
a
little
sooner
than
was
expected.
His
family
and
Miss
Keeldar
were
assembled
in
the
oak
parlour.
Addressing
the
latter,
he
requested
her
to
step
with
him
into
another
room.
He
wished
to
have
with
her
a
"strictly
private
interview."
She
rose,
asking
no
questions
and
professing
no
surprise.
"Very
well,
sir,"
she
said,
in
the
tone
of
a
determined
person
who
is
informed
that
the
dentist
is
come
to
extract
that
large
double
tooth
of
his,
from
which
he
has
suffered
such
a
purgatory
this
month
past.
She
left
her
sewing
and
her
thimble
in
the
window
seat,
and
followed
her
uncle
where
he
led.
Shut
into
the
drawing
room,
the
pair
took
seats,
each
in
an
arm
chair,
placed
opposite,
a
few
yards
between
them.
"I
have
been
to
De
Walden
Hall,"
said
Mr.
Sympson.
He
paused.
Miss
Keeldar's
eyes
were
on
the
pretty
white
and
green
carpet.
That
information
required
no
response.
She
gave
none.
"I
have
learned,"
he
went
on
slowly
"I
have
learned
a
circumstance
which
surprises
me."
Resting
her
cheek
on
her
forefinger,
she
waited
to
be
told
what
circumstance.
"It
seems
that
Nunnely
Priory
is
shut
up
that
the
family
are
gone
back
to
their
place
in
shire.
It
seems
that
the
baronet
that
the
baronet
that
Sir
Philip
himself
has
accompanied
his
mother
and
sisters."
"Indeed!"
said
Shirley.
"May
I
ask
if
you
share
the
amazement
with
which
I
received
this
news?"
"No,
sir."
"Is
it
news
to
you?"
"Yes,
sir."
"I
mean
I
mean,"
pursued
Mr.
Sympson,
now
fidgeting
in
his
chair,
quitting
his
hitherto
brief
and
tolerably
clear
phraseology,
and
returning
to
his
customary
wordy,
confused,
irritable
style
"I
mean
to
have
a
thorough
explanation.
I
will
not
be
put
off.
I
I
shall
insist
on
being
heard,
and
on
on
having
my
own
