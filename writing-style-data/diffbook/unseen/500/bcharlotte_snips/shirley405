the
cold
reflection
from
the
snow
glimmered
in
our
chamber,
then
I
saw
Shirley's
heart."
"Her
heart's
core?
Do
you
think
she
showed
you
that?"
"Her
heart's
core."
"And
how
was
it?"
"Like
a
shrine,
for
it
was
holy;
like
snow,
for
it
was
pure;
like
flame,
for
it
was
warm;
like
death,
for
it
was
strong."
"Can
she
love?
tell
me
that."
"What
think
you?"
"She
has
loved
none
that
have
loved
her
yet."
"Who
are
those
that
have
loved
her?"
He
named
a
list
of
gentlemen,
closing
with
Sir
Philip
Nunnely.
"She
has
loved
none
of
these."
"Yet
some
of
them
were
worthy
of
a
woman's
affection."
"Of
some
women's,
but
not
of
Shirley's."
"Is
she
better
than
others
of
her
sex?"
"She
is
peculiar,
and
more
dangerous
to
take
as
a
wife
rashly."
"I
can
imagine
that."
"She
spoke
of
you
"
"Oh,
she
did!
I
thought
you
denied
it."
"She
did
not
speak
in
the
way
you
fancy;
but
I
asked
her,
and
I
would
make
her
tell
me
what
she
thought
of
you,
or
rather
how
she
felt
towards
you.
I
wanted
to
know;
I
had
long
wanted
to
know."
"So
had
I;
but
let
us
hear.
She
thinks
meanly,
she
feels
contemptuously,
doubtless?"
"She
thinks
of
you
almost
as
highly
as
a
woman
can
think
of
a
man.
You
know
she
can
be
eloquent.
I
yet
feel
in
fancy
the
glow
of
the
language
in
which
her
opinion
was
conveyed."
"But
how
does
she
feel?"
"Till
you
shocked
her
(she
said
you
had
shocked
her,
but
she
would
not
tell
me
how)
she
felt
as
a
sister
feels
towards
a
brother
of
whom
she
is
at
once
fond
and
proud."
"I'll
shock
her
no
more,
Cary,
for
the
shock
rebounded
on
myself
till
I
staggered
again.
But
that
comparison
about
sister
and
brother
is
all
nonsense.
She
is
too
rich
and
proud
to
entertain
fraternal
sentiments
for
me."
"You
don't
know
her,
Robert;
and,
somehow,
I
fancy
now
(I
had
other
ideas
formerly)
that
you
cannot
know
her.
You
and
she
are
not
so
constructed
as
to
be
able
thoroughly
to
understand
each
other."
"It
may
be
so.
I
esteem
her,
I
admire
her;
and
yet
my
impressions
concerning
her
are
harsh
perhaps
uncharitable.
I
believe,
for
instance,
that
she
is
incapable
of
love
"
"Shirley
incapable
of
love!"
"That
she
will
never
marry.
I
imagine
her
jealous
of
compromising
her
pride,
of
relinquishing
her
power,
of
sharing
her
property."
"Shirley
has
hurt
your
amour
propre."
"She
did
hurt
it;
though
I
had
not
an
emotion
of
tenderness,
nor
a
spark
of
passion
for
her."
"Then,
Robert,
it
was
very
wicked
in
you
to
want
to
marry
her."
"And
very
mean,
my
little
pastor,
my
pretty
priestess.
I
never
wanted
to
kiss
Miss
Keeldar
in
my
life,
though
she
has
fine
lips,
scarlet
and
round
as
ripe
cherries;
or,
if
I
did
wish
it,
it
was
the
mere
desire
of
the
eye."
"I
doubt,
