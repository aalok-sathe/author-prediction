the
edge
of
the
bed
and
lean
over
the
pillow;
to
hold
his
brother's
hand,
and
press
his
pale
forehead
with
his
fraternal
lips;
and
Mrs.
Yorke
bore
it
well.
She
suffered
him
to
stay
half
the
day
there;
she
once
suffered
him
to
sit
up
all
night
in
the
chamber;
she
rose
herself
at
five
o'clock
of
a
wet
November
morning,
and
with
her
own
hands
lit
the
kitchen
fire,
and
made
the
brothers
a
breakfast,
and
served
it
to
them
herself.
Majestically
arrayed
in
a
boundless
flannel
wrapper,
a
shawl,
and
her
nightcap,
she
sat
and
watched
them
eat,
as
complacently
as
a
hen
beholds
her
chickens
feed.
Yet
she
gave
the
cook
warning
that
day
for
venturing
to
make
and
carry
up
to
Mr.
Moore
a
basin
of
sago
gruel;
and
the
housemaid
lost
her
favour
because,
when
Mr.
Louis
was
departing,
she
brought
him
his
surtout
aired
from
the
kitchen,
and,
like
a
"forward
piece"
as
she
was,
helped
him
on
with
it,
and
accepted
in
return
a
smile,
a
"Thank
you,
my
girl,"
and
a
shilling.
Two
ladies
called
one
day,
pale
and
anxious,
and
begged
earnestly,
humbly,
to
be
allowed
to
see
Mr.
Moore
one
instant.
Mrs.
Yorke
hardened
her
heart,
and
sent
them
packing
not
without
opprobrium.
But
how
was
it
when
Hortense
Moore
came?
Not
so
bad
as
might
have
been
expected.
The
whole
family
of
the
Moores
really
seemed
to
suit
Mrs.
Yorke
so
as
no
other
family
had
ever
suited
her.
Hortense
and
she
possessed
an
exhaustless
mutual
theme
of
conversation
in
the
corrupt
propensities
of
servants.
Their
views
of
this
class
were
similar;
they
watched
them
with
the
same
suspicion,
and
judged
them
with
the
same
severity.
Hortense,
too,
from
the
very
first
showed
no
manner
of
jealousy
of
Mrs.
Yorke's
attentions
to
Robert
she
let
her
keep
the
post
of
nurse
with
little
interference;
and,
for
herself,
found
ceaseless
occupation
in
fidgeting
about
the
house,
holding
the
kitchen
under
surveillance,
reporting
what
passed
there,
and,
in
short,
making
herself
generally
useful.
Visitors
they
both
of
them
agreed
in
excluding
sedulously
from
the
sickroom.
They
held
the
young
mill
owner
captive,
and
hardly
let
the
air
breathe
or
the
sun
shine
on
him.
Mr.
MacTurk,
the
surgeon
to
whom
Moore's
case
had
been
committed,
pronounced
his
wound
of
a
dangerous,
but,
he
trusted,
not
of
a
hopeless
character.
At
first
he
wished
to
place
with
him
a
nurse
of
his
own
selection;
but
this
neither
Mrs.
Yorke
nor
Hortense
would
hear
of.
They
promised
faithful
observance
of
directions.
He
was
left,
therefore,
for
the
present
in
their
hands.
Doubtless
they
executed
the
trust
to
the
best
of
their
ability;
but
something
got
wrong.
The
bandages
were
displaced
or
tampered
with;
great
loss
of
blood
followed.
MacTurk,
being
summoned,
came
with
steed
afoam.
He
was
one
of
those
surgeons
whom
it
is
dangerous
to
vex
abrupt
in
his
best
moods,
in
his
worst
savage.
On
seeing
Moore's
state
he
relieved
