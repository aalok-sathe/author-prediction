I
triumphed
over
her
mercilessly."
"What
right
had
you
to
triumph?
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
fancy
free?"
"Whatever
I
am,
Shirley
is
a
bondswoman.
Lioness,
she
has
found
her
captor.
Mistress
she
may
be
of
all
round
her,
but
her
own
mistress
she
is
not."
"So
you
exulted
at
recognizing
a
fellow
slave
in
one
so
fair
and
imperial?"
"I
did;
Robert,
you
say
right,
in
one
so
fair
and
imperial."
"You
confess
it
a
fellow
slave?"
"I
confess
nothing;
but
I
say
that
haughty
Shirley
is
no
more
free
than
was
Hagar."
"And
who,
pray,
is
the
Abraham,
the
hero
of
a
patriarch
who
has
achieved
such
a
conquest?"
"You
still
speak
scornfully,
and
cynically,
and
sorely;
but
I
will
make
you
change
your
note
before
I
have
done
with
you."
"We
will
see
that.
Can
she
marry
this
Cupidon?"
"Cupidon!
he
is
just
about
as
much
a
Cupidon
as
you
are
a
Cyclops."
"Can
she
marry
him?"
"You
will
see."
"I
want
to
know
his
name,
Cary."
"Guess
it."
"Is
it
any
one
in
this
neighbourhood?"
"Yes,
in
Briarfield
parish."
"Then
it
is
some
person
unworthy
of
her.
I
don't
know
a
soul
in
Briarfield
parish
her
equal."
"Guess."
"Impossible.
I
suppose
she
is
under
a
delusion,
and
will
plunge
into
some
absurdity,
after
all."
Caroline
smiled.
"Do
you
approve
the
choice?"
asked
Moore.
"Quite,
quite."
"Then
I
am
puzzled;
for
the
head
which
owns
this
bounteous
fall
of
hazel
curls
is
an
excellent
little
thinking
machine,
most
accurate
in
its
working.
It
boasts
a
correct,
steady
judgment,
inherited
from
'mamma,'
I
suppose."
"And
I
quite
approve,
and
mamma
was
charmed."
"'Mamma'
charmed
Mrs.
Pryor!
It
can't
be
romantic,
then?"
"It
is
romantic,
but
it
is
also
right."
"Tell
me,
Cary
tell
me
out
of
pity;
I
am
too
weak
to
be
tantalized."
"You
shall
be
tantalized
it
will
do
you
no
harm;
you
are
not
so
weak
as
you
pretend."
"I
have
twice
this
evening
had
some
thoughts
of
falling
on
the
floor
at
your
feet."
"You
had
better
not.
I
shall
decline
to
help
you
up."
"And
worshipping
you
downright.
My
mother
was
a
Roman
Catholic.
You
look
like
the
loveliest
of
her
pictures
of
the
Virgin.
I
think
I
will
embrace
her
faith
and
kneel
and
adore."
"Robert,
Robert,
sit
still;
don't
be
absurd.
I
will
go
to
Hortense
if
you
commit
extravagances."
"You
have
stolen
my
senses.
Just
now
nothing
will
come
into
my
mind
but
les
litanies
de
la
sainte
Vierge.
Rose
celeste,
reine
des
anges!"
"Tour
d'ivoire,
maison
d'or
is
not
that
the
jargon?
Well,
sit
down
quietly,
and
guess
your
riddle."
"But
'mamma'
charmed
there's
the
puzzle."
"I'll
tell
you
what
mamma
said
when
I
told
her.
'Depend
upon
it,
my
dear,
such
a
choice
will
make
the
happiness
of
Miss
Keeldar's
life.'"
"I'll
guess
once,
and
no
more.
It
is
old
Helstone.
She
is
going
to
be
your
aunt."
"I'll
tell
my
uncle;
I'll
tell
Shirley!"
cried
