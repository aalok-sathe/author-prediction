and
baffle
research.
It
must
suffice
to
know
that
the
world
then
existed;
that
men
peopled
it;
that
man's
nature,
with
its
passions,
sympathies,
pains,
and
pleasures,
informed
the
planet
and
gave
it
soul.
A
certain
tribe
colonized
a
certain
spot
on
the
globe;
of
what
race
this
tribe
unknown;
in
what
region
that
spot
untold.
We
usually
think
of
the
East
when
we
refer
to
transactions
of
that
date;
but
who
shall
declare
that
there
was
no
life
in
the
West,
the
South,
the
North?
What
is
to
disprove
that
this
tribe,
instead
of
camping
under
palm
groves
in
Asia,
wandered
beneath
island
oak
woods
rooted
in
our
own
seas
of
Europe?
It
is
no
sandy
plain,
nor
any
circumscribed
and
scant
oasis
I
seem
to
realize.
A
forest
valley,
with
rocky
sides
and
brown
profundity
of
shade,
formed
by
tree
crowding
on
tree,
descends
deep
before
me.
Here,
indeed,
dwell
human
beings,
but
so
few,
and
in
alleys
so
thick
branched
and
overarched,
they
are
neither
heard
nor
seen.
Are
they
savage?
Doubtless.
They
live
by
the
crook
and
the
bow;
half
shepherds,
half
hunters,
their
flocks
wander
wild
as
their
prey.
Are
they
happy?
No,
not
more
happy
than
we
are
at
this
day.
Are
they
good?
No,
not
better
than
ourselves.
Their
nature
is
our
nature
human
both.
There
is
one
in
this
tribe
too
often
miserable
a
child
bereaved
of
both
parents.
None
cares
for
this
child.
She
is
fed
sometimes,
but
oftener
forgotten.
A
hut
rarely
receives
her;
the
hollow
tree
and
chill
cavern
are
her
home.
Forsaken,
lost,
and
wandering,
she
lives
more
with
the
wild
beast
and
bird
than
with
her
own
kind.
Hunger
and
cold
are
her
comrades;
sadness
hovers
over,
and
solitude
besets
her
round.
Unheeded
and
unvalued,
she
should
die;
but
she
both
lives
and
grows.
The
green
wilderness
nurses
her,
and
becomes
to
her
a
mother;
feeds
her
on
juicy
berry,
on
saccharine
root
and
nut.
There
is
something
in
the
air
of
this
clime
which
fosters
life
kindly.
There
must
be
something,
too,
in
its
dews
which
heals
with
sovereign
balm.
Its
gentle
seasons
exaggerate
no
passion,
no
sense;
its
temperature
tends
to
harmony;
its
breezes,
you
would
say,
bring
down
from
heaven
the
germ
of
pure
thought
and
purer
feeling.
Not
grotesquely
fantastic
are
the
forms
of
cliff
and
foliage,
not
violently
vivid
the
colouring
of
flower
and
bird.
In
all
the
grandeur
of
these
forests
there
is
repose;
in
all
their
freshness
there
is
tenderness.
The
gentle
charm
vouchsafed
to
flower
and
tree,
bestowed
on
deer
and
dove,
has
not
been
denied
to
the
human
nursling.
All
solitary,
she
has
sprung
up
straight
and
graceful.
Nature
cast
her
features
in
a
fine
mould;
they
have
matured
in
their
pure,
accurate
first
lines,
unaltered
by
the
shocks
of
disease.
No
fierce
dry
blast
has
dealt
rudely
with
the
surface
of
her
frame;
no
burning
sun
has
crisped
or
withered
her
tresses.
Her
form
gleams
ivory
white
