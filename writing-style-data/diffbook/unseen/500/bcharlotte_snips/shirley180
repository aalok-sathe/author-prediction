I
on
the
text
of
economy
that
I
surprised
myself;
for,
you
see,
it
is
altogether
a
fresh
idea.
I
never
thought,
much
less
spoke,
on
the
subject
till
lately.
But
it
is
all
theory;
for
when
I
came
to
the
practical
part
I
could
retrench
nothing.
I
had
not
firmness
to
take
off
a
single
pound
of
butter,
or
to
prosecute
to
any
clear
result
an
inquest
into
the
destiny
of
either
dripping,
lard,
bread,
cold
meat,
or
other
kitchen
perquisite
whatever.
I
know
we
never
get
up
illuminations
at
Fieldhead,
but
I
could
not
ask
the
meaning
of
sundry
quite
unaccountable
pounds
of
candles.
We
do
not
wash
for
the
parish,
yet
I
viewed
in
silence
items
of
soap
and
bleaching
powder
calculated
to
satisfy
the
solicitude
of
the
most
anxious
inquirer
after
our
position
in
reference
to
those
articles.
Carnivorous
I
am
not,
nor
is
Mrs.
Pryor,
nor
is
Mrs.
Gill
herself,
yet
I
only
hemmed
and
opened
my
eyes
a
little
wide
when
I
saw
butchers'
bills
whose
figures
seemed
to
prove
that
fact
falsehood,
I
mean.
Caroline,
you
may
laugh
at
me,
but
you
can't
change
me.
I
am
a
poltroon
on
certain
points;
I
feel
it.
There
is
a
base
alloy
of
moral
cowardice
in
my
composition.
I
blushed
and
hung
my
head
before
Mrs.
Gill,
when
she
ought
to
have
been
faltering
confessions
to
me.
I
found
it
impossible
to
get
up
the
spirit
even
to
hint,
much
less
to
prove,
to
her
that
she
was
a
cheat.
I
have
no
calm
dignity,
no
true
courage
about
me."
"Shirley,
what
fit
of
self
injustice
is
this?
My
uncle,
who
is
not
given
to
speak
well
of
women,
says
there
are
not
ten
thousand
men
in
England
as
genuinely
fearless
as
you."
"I
am
fearless,
physically;
I
am
never
nervous
about
danger.
I
was
not
startled
from
self
possession
when
Mr.
Wynne's
great
red
bull
rose
with
a
bellow
before
my
face,
as
I
was
crossing
the
cowslip
lea
alone,
stooped
his
begrimed,
sullen
head,
and
made
a
run
at
me;
but
I
was
afraid
of
seeing
Mrs.
Gill
brought
to
shame
and
confusion
of
face.
You
have
twice
ten
times
my
strength
of
mind
on
certain
subjects,
Caroline.
You,
whom
no
persuasion
can
induce
to
pass
a
bull,
however
quiet
he
looks,
would
have
firmly
shown
my
housekeeper
she
had
done
wrong;
then
you
would
have
gently
and
wisely
admonished
her;
and
at
last,
I
dare
say,
provided
she
had
seemed
penitent,
you
would
have
very
sweetly
forgiven
her.
Of
this
conduct
I
am
incapable.
However,
in
spite
of
exaggerated
imposition,
I
still
find
we
live
within
our
means.
I
have
money
in
hand,
and
I
really
must
do
some
good
with
it.
The
Briarfield
poor
are
badly
off;
they
must
be
helped.
What
ought
I
to
do,
think
you,
Lina?
Had
I
not
better
distribute
the
cash
at
once?"
"No,
indeed,
Shirley;
you
will
not
manage
properly.
I
have
often
noticed
that
