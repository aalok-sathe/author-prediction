that
influence
alone.
The
dependent
fondness
of
her
nursling,
the
natural
affection
of
her
child,
came
over
her
suavely.
Her
frost
fell
away,
her
rigidity
unbent;
she
grew
smiling
and
pliant.
Not
that
Caroline
made
any
wordy
profession
of
love
that
would
ill
have
suited
Mrs.
Pryor;
she
would
have
read
therein
the
proof
of
insincerity
but
she
hung
on
her
with
easy
dependence;
she
confided
in
her
with
fearless
reliance.
These
things
contented
the
mother's
heart.
She
liked
to
hear
her
daughter
say,
"Mamma,
do
this;"
"Please,
mamma,
fetch
me
that;"
"Mamma,
read
to
me;"
"Sing
a
little,
mamma."
Nobody
else
not
one
living
thing
had
ever
so
claimed
her
services,
so
looked
for
help
at
her
hand.
Other
people
were
always
more
or
less
reserved
and
stiff
with
her,
as
she
was
reserved
and
stiff
with
them;
other
people
betrayed
consciousness
of
and
annoyance
at
her
weak
points.
Caroline
no
more
showed
such
wounding
sagacity
or
reproachful
sensitiveness
now
than
she
had
done
when
a
suckling
of
three
months
old.
Yet
Caroline
could
find
fault.
Blind
to
the
constitutional
defects
that
were
incurable,
she
had
her
eyes
wide
open
to
the
acquired
habits
that
were
susceptible
of
remedy.
On
certain
points
she
would
quite
artlessly
lecture
her
parent;
and
that
parent,
instead
of
being
hurt,
felt
a
sensation
of
pleasure
in
discovering
that
the
girl
dared
lecture
her,
that
she
was
so
much
at
home
with
her.
"Mamma,
I
am
determined
you
shall
not
wear
that
old
gown
any
more.
Its
fashion
is
not
becoming;
it
is
too
strait
in
the
skirt.
You
shall
put
on
your
black
silk
every
afternoon.
In
that
you
look
nice;
it
suits
you.
And
you
shall
have
a
black
satin
dress
for
Sundays
a
real
satin,
not
a
satinet
or
any
of
the
shams.
And,
mamma,
when
you
get
the
new
one,
mind
you
must
wear
it."
"My
dear,
I
thought
of
the
black
silk
serving
me
as
a
best
dress
for
many
years
yet,
and
I
wished
to
buy
you
several
things."
"Nonsense,
mamma.
My
uncle
gives
me
cash
to
get
what
I
want.
You
know
he
is
generous
enough;
and
I
have
set
my
heart
on
seeing
you
in
a
black
satin.
Get
it
soon,
and
let
it
be
made
by
a
dressmaker
of
my
recommending.
Let
me
choose
the
pattern.
You
always
want
to
disguise
yourself
like
a
grandmother.
You
would
persuade
one
that
you
are
old
and
ugly.
Not
at
all!
On
the
contrary,
when
well
dressed
and
cheerful
you
are
very
comely
indeed;
your
smile
is
so
pleasant,
your
teeth
are
so
white,
your
hair
is
still
such
a
pretty
light
colour.
And
then
you
speak
like
a
young
lady,
with
such
a
clear,
fine
tone,
and
you
sing
better
than
any
young
lady
I
ever
heard.
Why
do
you
wear
such
dresses
and
bonnets,
mamma,
such
as
nobody
else
ever
wears?"
"Does
it
annoy
you,
Caroline?"
"Very
much;
it
vexes
me
even.
People
say
you
are
