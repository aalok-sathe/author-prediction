that
blasphemy
against
God
and
the
king
was
a
deadly
sin,
and
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
'judgment
to
come.'"
Mr.
Yorke
"believed
fully
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
judgment
to
come.
If
it
were
otherwise,
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
how
all
the
scoundrels
who
seemed
triumphant
in
this
world,
who
broke
innocent
hearts
with
impunity,
abused
unmerited
privileges,
were
a
scandal
to
honourable
callings,
took
the
bread
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
poor,
browbeat
the
humble,
and
truckled
meanly
to
the
rich
and
proud,
were
to
be
properly
paid
off
in
such
coin
as
they
had
earned.
But,"
he
added,
"whenever
he
got
low
spirited
about
such
like
goings
on,
and
their
seeming
success
in
this
mucky
lump
of
a
planet,
he
just
reached
down
t'
owd
book"
(pointing
to
a
great
Bible
in
the
bookcase),
"opened
it
like
at
a
chance,
and
he
was
sure
to
light
of
a
verse
blazing
wi'
a
blue
brimstone
low
that
set
all
straight.
He
knew,"
he
said,
"where
some
folk
war
bound
for,
just
as
weel
as
if
an
angel
wi'
great
white
wings
had
come
in
ower
t'
door
stone
and
told
him."
"Sir,"
said
Mr.
Helstone,
collecting
all
his
dignity
"sir,
the
great
knowledge
of
man
is
to
know
himself,
and
the
bourne
whither
his
own
steps
tend."
"Ay,
ay.
You'll
recollect,
Mr.
Helstone,
that
Ignorance
was
carried
away
from
the
very
gates
of
heaven,
borne
through
the
air,
and
thrust
in
at
a
door
in
the
side
of
the
hill
which
led
down
to
hell."
"Nor
have
I
forgotten,
Mr.
Yorke,
that
Vain
Confidence,
not
seeing
the
way
before
him,
fell
into
a
deep
pit,
which
was
on
purpose
there
made
by
the
prince
of
the
grounds,
to
catch
vainglorious
fools
withal,
and
was
dashed
to
pieces
with
his
fall."
"Now,"
interposed
Mr.
Moore,
who
had
hitherto
sat
a
silent
but
amused
spectator
of
this
worldly
combat,
and
whose
indifference
to
the
party
politics
of
the
day,
as
well
as
to
the
gossip
of
the
neighbourhood,
made
him
an
impartial,
if
apathetic,
judge
of
the
merits
of
such
an
encounter,
"you
have
both
sufficiently
blackballed
each
other,
and
proved
how
cordially
you
detest
each
other,
and
how
wicked
you
think
each
other.
For
my
part,
my
hate
is
still
running
in
such
a
strong
current
against
the
fellows
who
have
broken
my
frames
that
I
have
none
to
spare
for
my
private
acquaintance,
and
still
less
for
such
a
vague
thing
as
a
sect
or
a
government.
But
really,
gentlemen,
you
both
seem
very
bad
by
your
own
showing
worse
than
ever
I
suspected
you
to
be.
I
dare
not
stay
all
night
with
a
rebel
and
blasphemer
like
you,
Yorke;
and
I
hardly
dare
ride
home
with
a
cruel
and
tyrannical
ecclesiastic
like
Mr.
Helstone."
"I
am
going,
however,
Mr.
Moore,"
said
the
rector
sternly.
"Come
with
me
or
not,
as
you
please."
"Nay,
he
shall
not
have
the
