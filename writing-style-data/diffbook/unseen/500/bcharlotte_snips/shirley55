back,
as
one
of
the
first
"duties
of
a
woman."
She
herself
had
had
a
needle,
cotton,
and
a
fearfully
torn
stocking
put
into
her
hand
while
she
yet
wore
a
child's
coif
on
her
little
black
head;
her
"hauts
faits"
in
the
darning
line
had
been
exhibited
to
company
ere
she
was
six
years
old;
and
when
she
first
discovered
that
Caroline
was
profoundly
ignorant
of
this
most
essential
of
attainments,
she
could
have
wept
with
pity
over
her
miserably
neglected
youth.
No
time
did
she
lose
in
seeking
up
a
hopeless
pair
of
hose,
of
which
the
heels
were
entirely
gone,
and
in
setting
the
ignorant
English
girl
to
repair
the
deficiency.
This
task
had
been
commenced
two
years
ago,
and
Caroline
had
the
stockings
in
her
work
bag
yet.
She
did
a
few
rows
every
day,
by
way
of
penance
for
the
expiation
of
her
sins.
They
were
a
grievous
burden
to
her;
she
would
much
have
liked
to
put
them
in
the
fire;
and
once
Mr.
Moore,
who
had
observed
her
sitting
and
sighing
over
them,
had
proposed
a
private
incremation
in
the
counting
house;
but
to
this
proposal
Caroline
knew
it
would
have
been
impolitic
to
accede
the
result
could
only
be
a
fresh
pair
of
hose,
probably
in
worse
condition.
She
adhered,
therefore,
to
the
ills
she
knew.
All
the
afternoon
the
two
ladies
sat
and
sewed,
till
the
eyes
and
fingers,
and
even
the
spirits
of
one
of
them,
were
weary.
The
sky
since
dinner
had
darkened;
it
had
begun
to
rain
again,
to
pour
fast.
Secret
fears
began
to
steal
on
Caroline
that
Robert
would
be
persuaded
by
Mr.
Sykes
or
Mr.
Yorke
to
remain
at
Whinbury
till
it
cleared,
and
of
that
there
appeared
no
present
chance.
Five
o'clock
struck,
and
time
stole
on;
still
the
clouds
streamed.
A
sighing
wind
whispered
in
the
roof
trees
of
the
cottage;
day
seemed
already
closing;
the
parlour
fire
shed
on
the
clear
hearth
a
glow
ruddy
as
at
twilight.
"It
will
not
be
fair
till
the
moon
rises,"
pronounced
Mademoiselle
Moore,
"consequently
I
feel
assured
that
my
brother
will
not
return
till
then.
Indeed
I
should
be
sorry
if
he
did.
We
will
have
coffee.
It
would
be
vain
to
wait
for
him."
"I
am
tired.
May
I
leave
my
work
now,
cousin?"
"You
may,
since
it
grows
too
dark
to
see
to
do
it
well.
Fold
it
up;
put
it
carefully
in
your
bag;
then
step
into
the
kitchen
and
desire
Sarah
to
bring
in
the
gouter,
or
tea,
as
you
call
it."
"But
it
has
not
yet
struck
six.
He
may
still
come."
"He
will
not,
I
tell
you.
I
can
calculate
his
movements.
I
understand
my
brother."
Suspense
is
irksome,
disappointment
bitter.
All
the
world
has,
some
time
or
other,
felt
that.
Caroline,
obedient
to
orders,
passed
into
the
kitchen.
Sarah
was
making
a
dress
for
herself
at
the
table.
"You
are
to
bring
in
coffee,"
said
the
young
lady
