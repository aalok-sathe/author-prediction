on
pleasantly
with
Sir
Philip
that
evening,
for
the
next
morning
she
came
down
in
one
of
her
best
moods.
"Who
will
take
a
walk
with
me?"
she
asked,
after
breakfast.
"Isabella
and
Gertrude,
will
you?"
So
rare
was
such
an
invitation
from
Miss
Keeldar
to
her
female
cousins
that
they
hesitated
before
they
accepted
it.
Their
mamma,
however,
signifying
acquiescence
in
the
project,
they
fetched
their
bonnets,
and
the
trio
set
out.
It
did
not
suit
these
three
young
persons
to
be
thrown
much
together.
Miss
Keeldar
liked
the
society
of
few
ladies;
indeed,
she
had
a
cordial
pleasure
in
that
of
none
except
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Caroline
Helstone.
She
was
civil,
kind,
attentive
even
to
her
cousins;
but
still
she
usually
had
little
to
say
to
them.
In
the
sunny
mood
of
this
particular
morning,
she
contrived
to
entertain
even
the
Misses
Sympson.
Without
deviating
from
her
wonted
rule
of
discussing
with
them
only
ordinary
themes,
she
imparted
to
these
themes
an
extraordinary
interest;
the
sparkle
of
her
spirit
glanced
along
her
phrases.
What
made
her
so
joyous?
All
the
cause
must
have
been
in
herself.
The
day
was
not
bright.
It
was
dim
a
pale,
waning
autumn
day.
The
walks
through
the
dun
woods
were
damp;
the
atmosphere
was
heavy,
the
sky
overcast;
and
yet
it
seemed
that
in
Shirley's
heart
lived
all
the
light
and
azure
of
Italy,
as
all
its
fervour
laughed
in
her
gray
English
eye.
Some
directions
necessary
to
be
given
to
her
foreman,
John,
delayed
her
behind
her
cousins
as
they
neared
Fieldhead
on
their
return.
Perhaps
an
interval
of
twenty
minutes
elapsed
between
her
separation
from
them
and
her
re
entrance
into
the
house.
In
the
meantime
she
had
spoken
to
John,
and
then
she
had
lingered
in
the
lane
at
the
gate.
A
summons
to
luncheon
called
her
in.
She
excused
herself
from
the
meal,
and
went
upstairs.
"Is
not
Shirley
coming
to
luncheon?"
asked
Isabella.
"She
said
she
was
hungry."
An
hour
after,
as
she
did
not
quit
her
chamber,
one
of
her
cousins
went
to
seek
her
there.
She
was
found
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
bed,
her
head
resting
on
her
hand;
she
looked
quite
pale,
very
thoughtful,
almost
sad.
"You
are
not
ill?"
was
the
question
put.
"A
little
sick,"
replied
Miss
Keeldar.
Certainly
she
was
not
a
little
changed
from
what
she
had
been
two
hours
before.
This
change,
accounted
for
only
by
those
three
words,
explained
no
otherwise;
this
change
whencesoever
springing,
effected
in
a
brief
ten
minutes
passed
like
no
light
summer
cloud.
She
talked
when
she
joined
her
friends
at
dinner,
talked
as
usual.
She
remained
with
them
during
the
evening.
When
again
questioned
respecting
her
health,
she
declared
herself
perfectly
recovered.
It
had
been
a
mere
passing
faintness,
a
momentary
sensation,
not
worth
a
thought;
yet
it
was
felt
there
was
a
difference
in
Shirley.
The
next
day
the
day,
the
week,
the
fortnight
after
this
new
and
peculiar
shadow
