Henry
to
the
door.
Without
hesitation
I
said,
'Go
where
you
will,
my
boy;
but,
till
I
call
you,
return
not
here.'
"Henry,
I
could
see,
did
not
like
his
dismissal.
That
boy
is
young,
but
a
thinker;
his
meditative
eye
shines
on
me
strangely
sometimes.
He
half
feels
what
links
me
to
Shirley;
he
half
guesses
that
there
is
a
dearer
delight
in
the
reserve
with
which
I
am
treated
than
in
all
the
endearments
he
is
allowed.
The
young,
lame,
half
grown
lion
would
growl
at
me
now
and
then,
because
I
have
tamed
his
lioness
and
am
her
keeper,
did
not
the
habit
of
discipline
and
the
instinct
of
affection
hold
him
subdued.
Go,
Henry;
you
must
learn
to
take
your
share
of
the
bitter
of
life
with
all
of
Adam's
race
that
have
gone
before
or
will
come
after
you.
Your
destiny
can
be
no
exception
to
the
common
lot;
be
grateful
that
your
love
is
overlooked
thus
early,
before
it
can
claim
any
affinity
to
passion.
An
hour's
fret,
a
pang
of
envy,
suffice
to
express
what
you
feel.
Jealousy
hot
as
the
sun
above
the
line,
rage
destructive
as
the
tropic
storm,
the
clime
of
your
sensations
ignores
as
yet.
"I
took
my
usual
seat
at
the
desk,
quite
in
my
usual
way.
I
am
blessed
in
that
power
to
cover
all
inward
ebullition
with
outward
calm.
No
one
who
looks
at
my
slow
face
can
guess
the
vortex
sometimes
whirling
in
my
heart,
and
engulfing
thought
and
wrecking
prudence.
Pleasant
is
it
to
have
the
gift
to
proceed
peacefully
and
powerfully
in
your
course
without
alarming
by
one
eccentric
movement.
It
was
not
my
present
intention
to
utter
one
word
of
love
to
her,
or
to
reveal
one
glimpse
of
the
fire
in
which
I
wasted.
Presumptuous
I
never
have
been;
presumptuous
I
never
will
be.
Rather
than
even
seem
selfish
and
interested,
I
would
resolutely
rise,
gird
my
loins,
part
and
leave
her,
and
seek,
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe,
a
new
life,
cold
and
barren
as
the
rock
the
salt
tide
daily
washes.
My
design
this
morning
was
to
take
of
her
a
near
scrutiny
to
read
a
line
in
the
page
of
her
heart.
Before
I
left
I
determined
to
know
what
I
was
leaving.
"I
had
some
quills
to
make
into
pens.
Most
men's
hands
would
have
trembled
when
their
hearts
were
so
stirred;
mine
went
to
work
steadily,
and
my
voice,
when
I
called
it
into
exercise,
was
firm.
"'This
day
week
you
will
be
alone
at
Fieldhead,
Miss
Keeldar.'
"'Yes:
I
rather
think
my
uncle's
intention
to
go
is
a
settled
one
now.'
"'He
leaves
you
dissatisfied.'
"'He
is
not
pleased
with
me.'
"'He
departs
as
he
came
no
better
for
his
journey.
This
is
mortifying.'
"'I
trust
the
failure
of
his
plans
will
take
from
him
all
inclination
to
lay
new
ones.'
"'In
his
way
Mr.
Sympson
honestly
wished
you
well.
All
he
has
