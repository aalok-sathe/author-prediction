be
to
marry
her
some
day
to
some
curate
or
mill
owner.
But
mind,
Caroline,
I
shall
inquire
about
the
bridegroom's
character;
and
if
he
is
not
a
gentleman
likely
to
render
happy
the
little
girl
who
walked
with
me
hand
in
hand
over
Nunnely
Common,
I
will
not
officiate.
So
take
care."
"The
caution
is
useless.
I
am
not
going
to
be
married.
I
shall
live
single,
like
your
sister
Margaret,
Mr.
Hall."
"Very
well.
You
might
do
worse.
Margaret
is
not
unhappy.
She
has
her
books
for
a
pleasure,
and
her
brother
for
a
care,
and
is
content.
If
ever
you
want
a
home,
if
the
day
should
come
when
Briarfield
rectory
is
yours
no
longer,
come
to
Nunnely
vicarage.
Should
the
old
maid
and
bachelor
be
still
living,
they
will
make
you
tenderly
welcome."
"There
are
your
flowers.
Now,"
said
Caroline,
who
had
kept
the
nosegay
she
had
selected
for
him
till
this
moment,
"you
don't
care
for
a
bouquet,
but
you
must
give
it
to
Margaret;
only
to
be
sentimental
for
once
keep
that
little
forget
me
not,
which
is
a
wild
flower
I
gathered
from
the
grass;
and
to
be
still
more
sentimental
let
me
take
two
or
three
of
the
blue
blossoms
and
put
them
in
my
souvenir."
And
she
took
out
a
small
book
with
enamelled
cover
and
silver
clasp,
wherein,
having
opened
it,
she
inserted
the
flowers,
writing
round
them
in
pencil,
"To
be
kept
for
the
sake
of
the
Rev.
Cyril
Hall,
my
friend.
May
18
."
The
Rev.
Cyril
Hall,
on
his
part,
also
placed
a
sprig
in
safety
between
the
leaves
of
a
pocket
Testament.
He
only
wrote
on
the
margin,
"Caroline."
"Now,"
said
he,
smiling,
"I
trust
we
are
romantic
enough.
Miss
Keeldar,"
he
continued
(the
curates,
by
the
bye,
during
this
conversation,
were
too
much
occupied
with
their
own
jokes
to
notice
what
passed
at
the
other
end
of
the
table),
"I
hope
you
are
laughing
at
this
trait
of
'exaltation'
in
the
old
gray
headed
vicar;
but
the
fact
is,
I
am
so
used
to
comply
with
the
requests
of
this
young
friend
of
yours,
I
don't
know
how
to
refuse
her
when
she
tells
me
to
do
anything.
You
would
say
it
is
not
much
in
my
way
to
traffic
with
flowers
and
forget
me
nots;
but,
you
see,
when
requested
to
be
sentimental,
I
am
obedient."
"He
is
naturally
rather
sentimental,"
remarked
Caroline.
"Margaret
told
me
so,
and
I
know
what
pleases
him."
"That
you
should
be
good
and
happy?
Yes;
that
is
one
of
my
greatest
pleasures.
May
God
long
preserve
to
you
the
blessings
of
peace
and
innocence!
By
which
phrase
I
mean
comparative
innocence;
for
in
His
sight,
I
am
well
aware,
none
are
pure.
What
to
our
human
perceptions
looks
spotless
as
we
fancy
angels,
is
to
Him
but
frailty,
needing
the
blood
of
His
Son
to
cleanse,
and
the
strength
of
His
Spirit
to
sustain.
Let
us
each
and
