beauty.
A
form
so
straight
and
fine,
I
argued,
must
conceal
a
mind
warped
and
cruel.
I
had
little
faith
in
the
power
of
education
to
rectify
such
a
mind;
or
rather,
I
entirely
misdoubted
my
own
ability
to
influence
it.
Caroline,
I
dared
not
undertake
to
rear
you.
I
resolved
to
leave
you
in
your
uncle's
hands.
Matthewson
Helstone
I
knew,
if
an
austere,
was
an
upright
man.
He
and
all
the
world
thought
hardly
of
me
for
my
strange,
unmotherly
resolve,
and
I
deserved
to
be
misjudged."
"Mamma,
why
did
you
call
yourself
Mrs.
Pryor?"
"It
was
a
name
in
my
mother's
family.
I
adopted
it
that
I
might
live
unmolested.
My
married
name
recalled
too
vividly
my
married
life;
I
could
not
bear
it.
Besides,
threats
were
uttered
of
forcing
me
to
return
to
bondage.
It
could
not
be.
Rather
a
bier
for
a
bed,
the
grave
for
a
home.
My
new
name
sheltered
me.
I
resumed
under
its
screen
my
old
occupation
of
teaching.
At
first
it
scarcely
procured
me
the
means
of
sustaining
life;
but
how
savoury
was
hunger
when
I
fasted
in
peace!
How
safe
seemed
the
darkness
and
chill
of
an
unkindled
hearth
when
no
lurid
reflection
from
terror
crimsoned
its
desolation!
How
serene
was
solitude,
when
I
feared
not
the
irruption
of
violence
and
vice!"
"But,
mamma,
you
have
been
in
this
neighbourhood
before.
How
did
it
happen
that
when
you
reappeared
here
with
Miss
Keeldar
you
were
not
recognized?"
"I
only
paid
a
short
visit,
as
a
bride,
twenty
years
ago,
and
then
I
was
very
different
to
what
I
am
now
slender,
almost
as
slender
as
my
daughter
is
at
this
day.
My
complexion,
my
very
features
are
changed;
my
hair,
my
style
of
dress
everything
is
altered.
You
cannot
fancy
me
a
slim
young
person,
attired
in
scanty
drapery
of
white
muslin,
with
bare
arms,
bracelets
and
necklace
of
beads,
and
hair
disposed
in
round
Grecian
curls
above
my
forehead?"
"You
must,
indeed,
have
been
different.
Mamma,
I
heard
the
front
door
open.
If
it
is
my
uncle
coming
in,
just
ask
him
to
step
upstairs,
and
let
me
hear
his
assurance
that
I
am
truly
awake
and
collected,
and
not
dreaming
or
delirious."
The
rector,
of
his
own
accord,
was
mounting
the
stairs,
and
Mrs.
Pryor
summoned
him
to
his
niece's
apartment.
"She's
not
worse,
I
hope?"
he
inquired
hastily.
"I
think
her
better.
She
is
disposed
to
converse;
she
seems
stronger."
"Good!"
said
he,
brushing
quickly
into
the
room.
"Ha,
Cary!
how
do?
Did
you
drink
my
cup
of
tea?
I
made
it
for
you
just
as
I
like
it
myself."
"I
drank
it
every
drop,
uncle.
It
did
me
good;
it
has
made
me
quite
alive.
I
have
a
wish
for
company,
so
I
begged
Mrs.
Pryor
to
call
you
in."
The
respected
ecclesiastic
looked
pleased,
and
yet
embarrassed.
He
was
willing
enough
to
bestow
his
company
on
his
sick
niece
for
ten
minutes,
since
it
