my
arrival
here
when
I
have
been
tempted
to
inquire
of
the
lady
of
Fieldhead
if
she
knew
what
had
become
of
my
former
pupil."
"She
is
here
now."
"I
see
her,
and
humble
enough;
but
I
would
neither
advise
Harry
nor
others
to
believe
too
implicitly
in
the
humility
which
one
moment
can
hide
its
blushing
face
like
a
modest
little
child,
and
the
next
lift
it
pale
and
lofty
as
a
marble
Juno."
"One
man
in
times
of
old,
it
is
said,
imparted
vitality
to
the
statue
he
had
chiselled;
others
may
have
the
contrary
gift
of
turning
life
to
stone."
Moore
paused
on
this
observation
before
he
replied
to
it.
His
look,
at
once
struck
and
meditative,
said,
"A
strange
phrase;
what
may
it
mean?"
He
turned
it
over
in
his
mind,
with
thought
deep
and
slow,
as
some
German
pondering
metaphysics.
"You
mean,"
he
said
at
last,
"that
some
men
inspire
repugnance,
and
so
chill
the
kind
heart."
"Ingenious!"
responded
Shirley.
"If
the
interpretation
pleases
you,
you
are
welcome
to
hold
it
valid.
I
don't
care."
And
with
that
she
raised
her
head,
lofty
in
look
and
statue
like
in
hue,
as
Louis
had
described
it.
"Behold
the
metamorphosis!"
he
said;
"scarce
imagined
ere
it
is
realized:
a
lowly
nymph
develops
to
an
inaccessible
goddess.
But
Henry
must
not
be
disappointed
of
his
recitation,
and
Olympia
will
deign
to
oblige
him.
Let
us
begin."
"I
have
forgotten
the
very
first
line."
"Which
I
have
not.
My
memory,
if
a
slow,
is
a
retentive
one.
I
acquire
deliberately
both
knowledge
and
liking.
The
acquisition
grows
into
my
brain,
and
the
sentiment
into
my
breast;
and
it
is
not
as
the
rapid
springing
produce
which,
having
no
root
in
itself,
flourishes
verdurous
enough
for
a
time,
but
too
soon
falls
withered
away.
Attention,
Henry!
Miss
Keeldar
consents
to
favour
you.
'Voyez
ce
cheval
ardent
et
impetueux,'
so
it
commences."
Miss
Keeldar
did
consent
to
make
the
effort;
but
she
soon
stopped.
"Unless
I
heard
the
whole
repeated
I
cannot
continue
it,"
she
said.
"Yet
it
was
quickly
learned
'soon
gained,
soon
gone,'"
moralized
the
tutor.
He
recited
the
passage
deliberately,
accurately,
with
slow,
impressive
emphasis.
Shirley,
by
degrees,
inclined
her
ear
as
he
went
on.
Her
face,
before
turned
from
him,
returned
towards
him.
When
he
ceased,
she
took
the
word
up
as
if
from
his
lips;
she
took
his
very
tone;
she
seized
his
very
accent;
she
delivered
the
periods
as
he
had
delivered
them;
she
reproduced
his
manner,
his
pronunciation,
his
expression.
It
was
now
her
turn
to
petition.
"Recall
'Le
Songe
d'Athalie,'"
she
entreated,
"and
say
it."
He
said
it
for
her.
She
took
it
from
him;
she
found
lively
excitement
in
the
pleasure
of
making
his
language
her
own.
She
asked
for
further
indulgence;
all
the
old
school
pieces
were
revived,
and
with
them
Shirley's
old
school
days.
He
had
gone
through
some
of
the
best
passages
of
Racine
and
Corneille,
and
then
had
