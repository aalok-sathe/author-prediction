it
has
been
settled
that
I
was
to
be
married
since
I
came
to
Briarfield.
They
have
assigned
me
every
marriageable
single
woman
by
turns
in
the
district.
Now
it
was
the
two
Misses
Wynns
first
the
dark,
then
the
light
one;
now
the
red
haired
Miss
Armitage;
then
the
mature
Ann
Pearson.
At
present
you
throw
on
my
shoulders
all
the
tribe
of
the
Misses
Sykes.
On
what
grounds
this
gossip
rests
God
knows.
I
visit
nowhere;
I
seek
female
society
about
as
assiduously
as
you
do,
Mr.
Malone.
If
ever
I
go
to
Whinbury,
it
is
only
to
give
Sykes
or
Pearson
a
call
in
their
counting
house,
where
our
discussions
run
on
other
topics
than
matrimony,
and
our
thoughts
are
occupied
with
other
things
than
courtships,
establishments,
dowries.
The
cloth
we
can't
sell,
the
hands
we
can't
employ,
the
mills
we
can't
run,
the
perverse
course
of
events
generally,
which
we
cannot
alter,
fill
our
hearts,
I
take
it,
pretty
well
at
present,
to
the
tolerably
complete
exclusion
of
such
figments
as
love
making,
etc."
"I
go
along
with
you
completely,
Moore.
If
there
is
one
notion
I
hate
more
than
another,
it
is
that
of
marriage
I
mean
marriage
in
the
vulgar
weak
sense,
as
a
mere
matter
of
sentiment
two
beggarly
fools
agreeing
to
unite
their
indigence
by
some
fantastic
tie
of
feeling.
Humbug!
But
an
advantageous
connection,
such
as
can
be
formed
in
consonance
with
dignity
of
views
and
permanency
of
solid
interests,
is
not
so
bad
eh?"
"No,"
responded
Moore,
in
an
absent
manner.
The
subject
seemed
to
have
no
interest
for
him;
he
did
not
pursue
it.
After
sitting
for
some
time
gazing
at
the
fire
with
a
preoccupied
air,
he
suddenly
turned
his
head.
"Hark!"
said
he.
"Did
you
hear
wheels?"
Rising,
he
went
to
the
window,
opened
it,
and
listened.
He
soon
closed
it.
"It
is
only
the
sound
of
the
wind
rising,"
he
remarked,
"and
the
rivulet
a
little
swollen,
rushing
down
the
hollow.
I
expected
those
wagons
at
six;
it
is
near
nine
now."
"Seriously,
do
you
suppose
that
the
putting
up
of
this
new
machinery
will
bring
you
into
danger?"
inquired
Malone.
"Helstone
seems
to
think
it
will."
"I
only
wish
the
machines
the
frames
were
safe
here,
and
lodged
within
the
walls
of
this
mill.
Once
put
up,
I
defy
the
frame
breakers.
Let
them
only
pay
me
a
visit
and
take
the
consequences.
My
mill
is
my
castle."
"One
despises
such
low
scoundrels,"
observed
Malone,
in
a
profound
vein
of
reflection.
"I
almost
wish
a
party
would
call
upon
you
to
night;
but
the
road
seemed
extremely
quiet
as
I
came
along.
I
saw
nothing
astir."
"You
came
by
the
Redhouse?"
"Yes."
"There
would
be
nothing
on
that
road.
It
is
in
the
direction
of
Stilbro'
the
risk
lies."
"And
you
think
there
is
risk?"
"What
these
fellows
have
done
to
others
they
may
do
to
me.
There
is
only
this
difference:
most
of
the
