his
wits,
he
declared
he
would
not.
Repeating
the
former
order,
I
added
a
commission
to
fetch
a
constable.
I
said,
'You
shall
go,
by
fair
means
or
foul.'
"He
threatened
prosecution;
I
cared
for
nothing.
I
had
stood
over
him
once
before,
not
quite
so
fiercely
as
now,
but
full
as
austerely.
It
was
one
night
when
burglars
attempted
the
house
at
Sympson
Grove,
and
in
his
wretched
cowardice
he
would
have
given
a
vain
alarm,
without
daring
to
offer
defence.
I
had
then
been
obliged
to
protect
his
family
and
his
abode
by
mastering
himself
and
I
had
succeeded.
I
now
remained
with
him
till
the
chaise
came.
I
marshalled
him
to
it,
he
scolding
all
the
way.
He
was
terribly
bewildered,
as
well
as
enraged.
He
would
have
resisted
me,
but
knew
not
how.
He
called
for
his
wife
and
daughters
to
come.
I
said
they
should
follow
him
as
soon
as
they
could
prepare.
The
smoke,
the
fume,
the
fret
of
his
demeanour
was
inexpressible,
but
it
was
a
fury
incapable
of
producing
a
deed.
That
man,
properly
handled,
must
ever
remain
impotent.
I
know
he
will
never
touch
me
with
the
law.
I
know
his
wife,
over
whom
he
tyrannizes
in
trifles,
guides
him
in
matters
of
importance.
I
have
long
since
earned
her
undying
mother's
gratitude
by
my
devotion
to
her
boy.
In
some
of
Henry's
ailments
I
have
nursed
him
better,
she
said,
than
any
woman
could
nurse.
She
will
never
forget
that.
She
and
her
daughters
quitted
me
to
day,
in
mute
wrath
and
consternation;
but
she
respects
me.
When
Henry
clung
to
my
neck
as
I
lifted
him
into
the
carriage
and
placed
him
by
her
side,
when
I
arranged
her
own
wrapping
to
make
her
warm,
though
she
turned
her
head
from
me,
I
saw
the
tears
start
to
her
eyes.
She
will
but
the
more
zealously
advocate
my
cause
because
she
has
left
me
in
anger.
I
am
glad
of
this
not
for
my
own
sake,
but
for
that
of
my
life
and
idol
my
Shirley."
Once
again
he
writes,
a
week
after:
"I
am
now
at
Stilbro'.
I
have
taken
up
my
temporary
abode
with
a
friend
a
professional
man,
in
whose
business
I
can
be
useful.
Every
day
I
ride
over
to
Fieldhead.
How
long
will
it
be
before
I
can
call
that
place
my
home,
and
its
mistress
mine?
I
am
not
easy,
not
tranquil;
I
am
tantalized,
sometimes
tortured.
To
see
her
now,
one
would
think
she
had
never
pressed
her
cheek
to
my
shoulder,
or
clung
to
me
with
tenderness
or
trust.
I
feel
unsafe;
she
renders
me
miserable.
I
am
shunned
when
I
visit
her;
she
withdraws
from
my
reach.
Once
this
day
I
lifted
her
face,
resolved
to
get
a
full
look
down
her
deep,
dark
eyes.
Difficult
to
describe
what
I
read
there!
Pantheress!
beautiful
forest
born!
wily,
tameless,
peerless
nature!
She
gnaws
her
chain;
I
see
the
white
teeth
working
