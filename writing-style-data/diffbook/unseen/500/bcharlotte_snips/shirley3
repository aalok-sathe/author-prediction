of
Nunnely
came
to
tea,
remained
to
supper,
occupied
the
spare
bed,
and
favoured
her
with
their
company
to
breakfast
on
Wednesday
morning;
now,
on
Thursday,
they
are
both
here
at
dinner,
and
she
is
almost
certain
they
will
stay
all
night.
"C'en
est
trop,"
she
would
say,
if
she
could
speak
French.
Mr.
Sweeting
is
mincing
the
slice
of
roast
beef
on
his
plate,
and
complaining
that
it
is
very
tough;
Mr.
Donne
says
the
beer
is
flat.
Ay,
that
is
the
worst
of
it:
if
they
would
only
be
civil
Mrs.
Gale
wouldn't
mind
it
so
much,
if
they
would
only
seem
satisfied
with
what
they
get
she
wouldn't
care;
but
"these
young
parsons
is
so
high
and
so
scornful,
they
set
everybody
beneath
their
'fit.'
They
treat
her
with
less
than
civility,
just
because
she
doesn't
keep
a
servant,
but
does
the
work
of
the
house
herself,
as
her
mother
did
afore
her;
then
they
are
always
speaking
against
Yorkshire
ways
and
Yorkshire
folk,"
and
by
that
very
token
Mrs.
Gale
does
not
believe
one
of
them
to
be
a
real
gentleman,
or
come
of
gentle
kin.
"The
old
parsons
is
worth
the
whole
lump
of
college
lads;
they
know
what
belongs
to
good
manners,
and
is
kind
to
high
and
low."
"More
bread!"
cries
Mr.
Malone,
in
a
tone
which,
though
prolonged
but
to
utter
two
syllables,
proclaims
him
at
once
a
native
of
the
land
of
shamrocks
and
potatoes.
Mrs.
Gale
hates
Mr.
Malone
more
than
either
of
the
other
two;
but
she
fears
him
also,
for
he
is
a
tall,
strongly
built
personage,
with
real
Irish
legs
and
arms,
and
a
face
as
genuinely
national
not
the
Milesian
face,
not
Daniel
O'Connell's
style,
but
the
high
featured,
North
American
Indian
sort
of
visage,
which
belongs
to
a
certain
class
of
the
Irish
gentry,
and
has
a
petrified
and
proud
look,
better
suited
to
the
owner
of
an
estate
of
slaves
than
to
the
landlord
of
a
free
peasantry.
Mr.
Malone's
father
termed
himself
a
gentleman:
he
was
poor
and
in
debt,
and
besottedly
arrogant;
and
his
son
was
like
him.
Mrs.
Gale
offered
the
loaf.
"Cut
it,
woman,"
said
her
guest;
and
the
"woman"
cut
it
accordingly.
Had
she
followed
her
inclinations,
she
would
have
cut
the
parson
also;
her
Yorkshire
soul
revolted
absolutely
from
his
manner
of
command.
The
curates
had
good
appetites,
and
though
the
beef
was
"tough,"
they
ate
a
great
deal
of
it.
They
swallowed,
too,
a
tolerable
allowance
of
the
"flat
beer,"
while
a
dish
of
Yorkshire
pudding,
and
two
tureens
of
vegetables,
disappeared
like
leaves
before
locusts.
The
cheese,
too,
received
distinguished
marks
of
their
attention;
and
a
"spice
cake,"
which
followed
by
way
of
dessert,
vanished
like
a
vision,
and
was
no
more
found.
Its
elegy
was
chanted
in
the
kitchen
by
Abraham,
Mrs.
Gale's
son
and
heir,
a
youth
of
six
summers;
he
had
reckoned
upon
the
reversion
thereof,
and
when
his
mother
brought
down
the
