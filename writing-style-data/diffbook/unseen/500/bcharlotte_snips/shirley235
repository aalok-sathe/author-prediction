operative
class.
It
is
difficult
to
be
tolerant,
difficult
to
be
just,
in
such
moments.
Caroline
rose;
Shirley
put
her
arm
round
her:
they
stood
together
as
still
as
the
straight
stems
of
two
trees.
That
yell
was
a
long
one,
and
when
it
ceased
the
night
was
yet
full
of
the
swaying
and
murmuring
of
a
crowd.
"What
next?"
was
the
question
of
the
listeners.
Nothing
came
yet.
The
mill
remained
mute
as
a
mausoleum.
"He
cannot
be
alone!"
whispered
Caroline.
"I
would
stake
all
I
have
that
he
is
as
little
alone
as
he
is
alarmed,"
responded
Shirley.
Shots
were
discharged
by
the
rioters.
Had
the
defenders
waited
for
this
signal?
It
seemed
so.
The
hitherto
inert
and
passive
mill
woke;
fire
flashed
from
its
empty
window
frames;
a
volley
of
musketry
pealed
sharp
through
the
Hollow.
"Moore
speaks
at
last!"
said
Shirley,
"and
he
seems
to
have
the
gift
of
tongues.
That
was
not
a
single
voice."
"He
has
been
forbearing.
No
one
can
accuse
him
of
rashness,"
alleged
Caroline.
"Their
discharge
preceded
his.
They
broke
his
gates
and
his
windows.
They
fired
at
his
garrison
before
he
repelled
them."
What
was
going
on
now?
It
seemed
difficult,
in
the
darkness,
to
distinguish;
but
something
terrible,
a
still
renewing
tumult,
was
obvious
fierce
attacks,
desperate
repulses.
The
mill
yard,
the
mill
itself,
was
full
of
battle
movement.
There
was
scarcely
any
cessation
now
of
the
discharge
of
firearms;
and
there
was
struggling,
rushing,
trampling,
and
shouting
between.
The
aim
of
the
assailants
seemed
to
be
to
enter
the
mill,
that
of
the
defenders
to
beat
them
off.
They
heard
the
rebel
leader
cry,
"To
the
back,
lads!"
They
heard
a
voice
retort,
"Come
round;
we
will
meet
you."
"To
the
counting
house!"
was
the
order
again.
"Welcome!
we
shall
have
you
there!"
was
the
response.
And
accordingly
the
fiercest
blaze
that
had
yet
glowed,
the
loudest
rattle
that
had
yet
been
heard,
burst
from
the
counting
house
front
when
the
mass
of
rioters
rushed
up
to
it.
The
voice
that
had
spoken
was
Moore's
own
voice.
They
could
tell
by
its
tones
that
his
soul
was
now
warm
with
the
conflict;
they
could
guess
that
the
fighting
animal
was
roused
in
every
one
of
those
men
there
struggling
together,
and
was
for
the
time
quite
paramount
above
the
rational
human
being.
Both
the
girls
felt
their
faces
glow
and
their
pulses
throb;
both
knew
they
would
do
no
good
by
rushing
down
into
the
melee.
They
desired
neither
to
deal
nor
to
receive
blows;
but
they
could
not
have
run
away
Caroline
no
more
than
Shirley;
they
could
not
have
fainted;
they
could
not
have
taken
their
eyes
from
the
dim,
terrible
scene
from
the
mass
of
cloud,
of
smoke,
the
musket
lightning
for
the
world.
"How
and
when
would
it
end?"
was
the
demand
throbbing
in
their
throbbing
pulses.
"Would
a
juncture
arise
in
which
they
could
be
useful?"
was
what
they
waited
to
see;
for
