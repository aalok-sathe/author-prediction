He
was
now
resuming
his
strength,
and
making
strange
head
against
Mrs.
Horsfall.
Each
morning
he
amazed
that
matron
with
a
fresh
astonishment.
First
he
discharged
her
from
her
valet
duties;
he
would
dress
himself.
Then
he
refused
the
coffee
she
brought
him;
he
would
breakfast
with
the
family.
Lastly,
he
forbade
her
his
chamber.
On
the
same
day,
amidst
the
outcries
of
all
the
women
in
the
place,
he
put
his
head
out
of
doors.
The
morning
after,
he
followed
Mr.
Yorke
to
his
counting
house,
and
requested
an
envoy
to
fetch
a
chaise
from
the
Red
House
Inn.
He
was
resolved,
he
said,
to
return
home
to
the
Hollow
that
very
afternoon.
Mr.
Yorke,
instead
of
opposing,
aided
and
abetted
him.
The
chaise
was
sent
for,
though
Mrs.
Yorke
declared
the
step
would
be
his
death.
It
came.
Moore,
little
disposed
to
speak,
made
his
purse
do
duty
for
his
tongue.
He
expressed
his
gratitude
to
the
servants
and
to
Mrs.
Horsfall
by
the
chink
of
his
coin.
The
latter
personage
approved
and
understood
this
language
perfectly;
it
made
amends
for
all
previous
contumacy.
She
and
her
patient
parted
the
best
friends
in
the
world.
The
kitchen
visited
and
soothed,
Moore
betook
himself
to
the
parlour.
He
had
Mrs.
Yorke
to
appease;
not
quite
so
easy
a
task
as
the
pacification
of
her
housemaids.
There
she
sat
plunged
in
sullen
dudgeon,
the
gloomiest
speculations
on
the
depths
of
man's
ingratitude
absorbing
her
thoughts.
He
drew
near
and
bent
over
her;
she
was
obliged
to
look
up,
if
it
were
only
to
bid
him
"avaunt."
There
was
beauty
still
in
his
pale,
wasted
features;
there
was
earnestness
and
a
sort
of
sweetness
for
he
was
smiling
in
his
hollow
eyes.
"Good
bye!"
he
said,
and
as
he
spoke
the
smile
glittered
and
melted.
He
had
no
iron
mastery
of
his
sensations
now;
a
trifling
emotion
made
itself
apparent
in
his
present
weak
state.
"And
what
are
you
going
to
leave
us
for?"
she
asked.
"We
will
keep
you,
and
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you,
if
you
will
only
stay
till
you
are
stronger."
"Good
bye!"
he
again
said;
and
added,
"You
have
been
a
mother
to
me;
give
your
wilful
son
one
embrace."
Like
a
foreigner,
as
he
was,
he
offered
her
first
one
cheek,
then
the
other.
She
kissed
him.
"What
a
trouble
what
a
burden
I
have
been
to
you!"
he
muttered.
"You
are
the
worst
trouble
now,
headstrong
youth!"
was
the
answer.
"I
wonder
who
is
to
nurse
you
at
Hollow's
Cottage?
Your
sister
Hortense
knows
no
more
about
such
matters
than
a
child."
"Thank
God!
for
I
have
had
nursing
enough
to
last
me
my
life."
Here
the
little
girls
came
in
Jessie
crying,
Rose
quiet
but
grave.
Moore
took
them
out
into
the
hall
to
soothe,
pet,
and
kiss
them.
He
knew
it
was
not
in
their
mother's
nature
to
bear
to
see
any
living
thing
caressed
but
herself.
She
would
have
