it,
is
simply
the
restoration
of
that
filthy,
feeble
Ferdinand
to
a
throne
which
he
disgraced.
Your
fit
representative
of
an
honest
people
is
a
dull
witted
drover,
acting
for
a
duller
witted
farmer;
and
against
these
are
arrayed
victorious
supremacy
and
invincible
genius."
"Against
legitimacy
is
arrayed
usurpation;
against
modest,
single
minded,
righteous,
and
brave
resistance
to
encroachment
is
arrayed
boastful,
double
tongued,
selfish,
and
treacherous
ambition
to
possess.
God
defend
the
right!"
"God
often
defends
the
powerful."
"What!
I
suppose
the
handful
of
Israelites
standing
dryshod
on
the
Asiatic
side
of
the
Red
Sea
was
more
powerful
than
the
host
of
the
Egyptians
drawn
up
on
the
African
side?
Were
they
more
numerous?
Were
they
better
appointed?
Were
they
more
mighty,
in
a
word
eh?
Don't
speak,
or
you'll
tell
a
lie,
Moore;
you
know
you
will.
They
were
a
poor,
overwrought
band
of
bondsmen.
Tyrants
had
oppressed
them
through
four
hundred
years;
a
feeble
mixture
of
women
and
children
diluted
their
thin
ranks;
their
masters,
who
roared
to
follow
them
through
the
divided
flood,
were
a
set
of
pampered
Ethiops,
about
as
strong
and
brutal
as
the
lions
of
Libya.
They
were
armed,
horsed,
and
charioted;
the
poor
Hebrew
wanderers
were
afoot.
Few
of
them,
it
is
likely,
had
better
weapons
than
their
shepherds'
crooks
or
their
masons'
building
tools;
their
meek
and
mighty
leader
himself
had
only
his
rod.
But
bethink
you,
Robert
Moore,
right
was
with
them;
the
God
of
battles
was
on
their
side.
Crime
and
the
lost
archangel
generalled
the
ranks
of
Pharaoh,
and
which
triumphed?
We
know
that
well.
'The
Lord
saved
Israel
that
day
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Egyptians,
and
Israel
saw
the
Egyptians
dead
upon
the
sea
shore'
yea,
'the
depths
covered
them,
they
sank
to
the
bottom
as
a
stone.'
The
right
hand
of
the
Lord
became
glorious
in
power;
the
right
hand
of
the
Lord
dashed
in
pieces
the
enemy!"
"You
are
all
right;
only
you
forget
the
true
parallel.
France
is
Israel,
and
Napoleon
is
Moses.
Europe,
with
her
old
overgorged
empires
and
rotten
dynasties,
is
corrupt
Egypt;
gallant
France
is
the
Twelve
Tribes,
and
her
fresh
and
vigorous
Usurper
the
Shepherd
of
Horeb."
"I
scorn
to
answer
you."
Moore
accordingly
answered
himself
at
least,
he
subjoined
to
what
he
had
just
said
an
additional
observation
in
a
lower
voice.
"Oh,
in
Italy
he
was
as
great
as
any
Moses!
He
was
the
right
thing
there,
fit
to
head
and
organize
measures
for
the
regeneration
of
nations.
It
puzzles
me
to
this
day
how
the
conqueror
of
Lodi
should
have
condescended
to
become
an
emperor,
a
vulgar,
a
stupid
humbug;
and
still
more
how
a
people
who
had
once
called
themselves
republicans
should
have
sunk
again
to
the
grade
of
mere
slaves.
I
despise
France!
If
England
had
gone
as
far
on
the
march
of
civilization
as
France
did,
she
would
hardly
have
retreated
so
shamelessly."
"You
don't
mean
to
say
that
besotted
imperial
France
