the
red
grate.
"Comfortable
quarters
you
have
here,
Mr.
Moore;
and
all
snug
to
yourself."
"Yes,
but
my
sister
would
be
glad
to
see
you,
if
you
would
prefer
stepping
into
the
house."
"Oh
no!
The
ladies
are
best
alone,
I
never
was
a
lady's
man.
You
don't
mistake
me
for
my
friend
Sweeting,
do
you,
Mr.
Moore?"
"Sweeting!
Which
of
them
is
that?
The
gentleman
in
the
chocolate
overcoat,
or
the
little
gentleman?"
"The
little
one
he
of
Nunnely;
the
cavalier
of
the
Misses
Sykes,
with
the
whole
six
of
whom
he
is
in
love,
ha!
ha!"
"Better
be
generally
in
love
with
all
than
specially
with
one,
I
should
think,
in
that
quarter."
"But
he
is
specially
in
love
with
one
besides,
for
when
I
and
Donne
urged
him
to
make
a
choice
amongst
the
fair
bevy,
he
named
which
do
you
think?"
With
a
queer,
quiet
smile
Mr.
Moore
replied,
"Dora,
of
course,
or
Harriet."
"Ha!
ha!
you've
an
excellent
guess.
But
what
made
you
hit
on
those
two?"
"Because
they
are
the
tallest,
the
handsomest,
and
Dora,
at
least,
is
the
stoutest;
and
as
your
friend
Mr.
Sweeting
is
but
a
little
slight
figure,
I
concluded
that,
according
to
a
frequent
rule
in
such
cases,
he
preferred
his
contrast."
"You
are
right;
Dora
it
is.
But
he
has
no
chance,
has
he,
Moore?"
"What
has
Mr.
Sweeting
besides
his
curacy?"
This
question
seemed
to
tickle
Malone
amazingly.
He
laughed
for
full
three
minutes
before
he
answered
it.
"What
has
Sweeting?
Why,
David
has
his
harp,
or
flute,
which
comes
to
the
same
thing.
He
has
a
sort
of
pinchbeck
watch;
ditto,
ring;
ditto,
eyeglass.
That's
what
he
has."
"How
would
he
propose
to
keep
Miss
Sykes
in
gowns
only?"
"Ha!
ha!
Excellent!
I'll
ask
him
that
next
time
I
see
him.
I'll
roast
him
for
his
presumption.
But
no
doubt
he
expects
old
Christopher
Sykes
would
do
something
handsome.
He
is
rich,
is
he
not?
They
live
in
a
large
house."
"Sykes
carries
on
an
extensive
concern."
"Therefore
he
must
be
wealthy,
eh?"
"Therefore
he
must
have
plenty
to
do
with
his
wealth,
and
in
these
times
would
be
about
as
likely
to
think
of
drawing
money
from
the
business
to
give
dowries
to
his
daughters
as
I
should
be
to
dream
of
pulling
down
the
cottage
there,
and
constructing
on
its
ruins
a
house
as
large
as
Fieldhead."
"Do
you
know
what
I
heard,
Moore,
the
other
day?"
"No.
Perhaps
that
I
was
about
to
effect
some
such
change.
Your
Briarfield
gossips
are
capable
of
saying
that
or
sillier
things."
"That
you
were
going
to
take
Fieldhead
on
a
lease
(I
thought
it
looked
a
dismal
place,
by
the
bye,
to
night,
as
I
passed
it),
and
that
it
was
your
intention
to
settle
a
Miss
Sykes
there
as
mistress
to
be
married,
in
short,
ha!
ha!
Now,
which
is
it?
Dora,
I
am
sure.
You
said
she
was
the
handsomest."
"I
wonder
how
often
