number
was
Mr.
Sympson.
"I
disappointed?
What
is
it
to
me?
Have
I
an
interest
in
it?
You
would
insinuate,
perhaps,
that
I
have
motives?"
"Most
people
have
motives
of
some
sort
for
their
actions."
"She
accuses
me
to
my
face!
I,
that
have
been
a
parent
to
her,
she
charges
with
bad
motives!"
"Bad
motives
I
did
not
say."
"And
now
you
prevaricate;
you
have
no
principles!"
"Uncle,
you
tire
me.
I
want
to
go
away."
"Go
you
shall
not!
I
will
be
answered.
What
are
your
intentions,
Miss
Keeldar?"
"In
what
respect?"
"In
respect
of
matrimony?"
"To
be
quiet,
and
to
do
just
as
I
please."
"Just
as
you
please!
The
words
are
to
the
last
degree
indecorous."
"Mr.
Sympson,
I
advise
you
not
to
become
insulting.
You
know
I
will
not
bear
that."
"You
read
French.
Your
mind
is
poisoned
with
French
novels.
You
have
imbibed
French
principles."
"The
ground
you
are
treading
now
returns
a
mighty
hollow
sound
under
your
feet.
Beware!"
"It
will
end
in
infamy,
sooner
or
later.
I
have
foreseen
it
all
along."
"Do
you
assert,
sir,
that
something
in
which
I
am
concerned
will
end
in
infamy?"
"That
it
will
that
it
will.
You
said
just
now
you
would
act
as
you
please.
You
acknowledge
no
rules
no
limitations."
"Silly
stuff,
and
vulgar
as
silly!"
"Regardless
of
decorum,
you
are
prepared
to
fly
in
the
face
of
propriety."
"You
tire
me,
uncle."
"What,
madam
what
could
be
your
reasons
for
refusing
Sir
Philip?"
"At
last
there
is
another
sensible
question;
I
shall
be
glad
to
reply
to
it.
Sir
Philip
is
too
young
for
me.
I
regard
him
as
a
boy.
All
his
relations
his
mother
especially
would
be
annoyed
if
he
married
me.
Such
a
step
would
embroil
him
with
them.
I
am
not
his
equal
in
the
world's
estimation."
"Is
that
all?"
"Our
dispositions
are
not
compatible."
"Why,
a
more
amiable
gentleman
never
breathed."
"He
is
very
amiable
very
excellent
truly
estimable;
but
not
my
master
not
in
one
point.
I
could
not
trust
myself
with
his
happiness.
I
would
not
undertake
the
keeping
of
it
for
thousands.
I
will
accept
no
hand
which
cannot
hold
me
in
check."
"I
thought
you
liked
to
do
as
you
please.
You
are
vastly
inconsistent."
"When
I
promise
to
obey,
it
shall
be
under
the
conviction
that
I
can
keep
that
promise.
I
could
not
obey
a
youth
like
Sir
Philip.
Besides,
he
would
never
command
me.
He
would
expect
me
always
to
rule
to
guide
and
I
have
no
taste
whatever
for
the
office."
"You
no
taste
for
swaggering,
and
subduing,
and
ordering,
and
ruling?"
"Not
my
husband;
only
my
uncle."
"Where
is
the
difference?"
"There
is
a
slight
difference
that
is
certain.
And
I
know
full
well
any
man
who
wishes
to
live
in
decent
comfort
with
me
as
a
husband
must
be
able
to
control
me."
"I
wish
you
had
a
real
tyrant."
"A
tyrant
would
not
hold
me
for
