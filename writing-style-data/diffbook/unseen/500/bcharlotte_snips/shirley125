and
affection.
To
this
extenuated
spectre,
perhaps,
a
crumb
is
not
thrown
once
a
year,
but
when
ahungered
and
athirst
to
famine
when
all
humanity
has
forgotten
the
dying
tenant
of
a
decaying
house
Divine
mercy
remembers
the
mourner,
and
a
shower
of
manna
falls
for
lips
that
earthly
nutriment
is
to
pass
no
more.
Biblical
promises,
heard
first
in
health,
but
then
unheeded,
come
whispering
to
the
couch
of
sickness;
it
is
felt
that
a
pitying
God
watches
what
all
mankind
have
forsaken.
The
tender
compassion
of
Jesus
is
recalled
and
relied
on;
the
faded
eye,
gazing
beyond
time,
sees
a
home,
a
friend,
a
refuge
in
eternity.
Miss
Mann,
drawn
on
by
the
still
attention
of
her
listener,
proceeded
to
allude
to
circumstances
in
her
past
life.
She
spoke
like
one
who
tells
the
truth
simply,
and
with
a
certain
reserve;
she
did
not
boast,
nor
did
she
exaggerate.
Caroline
found
that
the
old
maid
had
been
a
most
devoted
daughter
and
sister,
an
unwearied
watcher
by
lingering
deathbeds;
that
to
prolonged
and
unrelaxing
attendance
on
the
sick
the
malady
that
now
poisoned
her
own
life
owed
its
origin;
that
to
one
wretched
relative
she
had
been
a
support
and
succour
in
the
depths
of
self
earned
degradation,
and
that
it
was
still
her
hand
which
kept
him
from
utter
destitution.
Miss
Helstone
stayed
the
whole
evening,
omitting
to
pay
her
other
intended
visit;
and
when
she
left
Miss
Mann
it
was
with
the
determination
to
try
in
future
to
excuse
her
faults;
never
again
to
make
light
of
her
peculiarities
or
to
laugh
at
her
plainness;
and,
above
all
things,
not
to
neglect
her,
but
to
come
once
a
week,
and
to
offer
her,
from
one
human
heart
at
least,
the
homage
of
affection
and
respect.
She
felt
she
could
now
sincerely
give
her
a
small
tribute
of
each
feeling.
Caroline,
on
her
return,
told
Fanny
she
was
very
glad
she
had
gone
out,
as
she
felt
much
better
for
the
visit.
The
next
day
she
failed
not
to
seek
Miss
Ainley.
This
lady
was
in
narrower
circumstances
than
Miss
Mann,
and
her
dwelling
was
more
humble.
It
was,
however,
if
possible,
yet
more
exquisitely
clean,
though
the
decayed
gentlewoman
could
not
afford
to
keep
a
servant,
but
waited
on
herself,
and
had
only
the
occasional
assistance
of
a
little
girl
who
lived
in
a
cottage
near.
Not
only
was
Miss
Ainley
poorer,
but
she
was
even
plainer
than
the
other
old
maid.
In
her
first
youth
she
must
have
been
ugly;
now,
at
the
age
of
fifty,
she
was
very
ugly.
At
first
sight,
all
but
peculiarly
well
disciplined
minds
were
apt
to
turn
from
her
with
annoyance,
to
conceive
against
her
a
prejudice,
simply
on
the
ground
of
her
unattractive
look.
Then
she
was
prim
in
dress
and
manner;
she
looked,
spoke,
and
moved
the
complete
old
maid.
Her
welcome
to
Caroline
was
formal,
even
in
its
kindness
for
it
was
kind;
but

Helstone
