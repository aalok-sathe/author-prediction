virus
mingled
with
your
blood;
and
if
it
did,
let
me
assure
you
that,
young,
healthy,
faultlessly
sound
as
you
are,
no
harm
will
ensue.
For
the
rest,
I
shall
inquire
whether
the
dog
was
really
mad.
I
hold
she
was
not
mad."
"Tell
nobody
that
she
bit
me."
"Why
should
I,
when
I
believe
the
bite
innocuous
as
a
cut
of
this
penknife?
Make
yourself
easy.
I
am
easy,
though
I
value
your
life
as
much
as
I
do
my
own
chance
of
happiness
in
eternity.
Look
up."
"Why,
Mr.
Moore?"
"I
wish
to
see
if
you
are
cheered.
Put
your
work
down;
raise
your
head."
"There
"
"Look
at
me.
Thank
you.
And
is
the
cloud
broken?"
"I
fear
nothing."
"Is
your
mind
restored
to
its
own
natural
sunny
clime?"
"I
am
very
content;
but
I
want
your
promise."
"Dictate."
"You
know,
in
case
the
worst
I
have
feared
should
happen,
they
will
smother
me.
You
need
not
smile.
They
will;
they
always
do.
My
uncle
will
be
full
of
horror,
weakness,
precipitation;
and
that
is
the
only
expedient
which
will
suggest
itself
to
him.
Nobody
in
the
house
will
be
self
possessed
but
you.
Now
promise
to
befriend
me
to
keep
Mr.
Sympson
away
from
me,
not
to
let
Henry
come
near,
lest
I
should
hurt
him.
Mind
mind
that
you
take
care
of
yourself
too.
But
I
shall
not
injure
you;
I
know
I
shall
not.
Lock
the
chamber
door
against
the
surgeons;
turn
them
out
if
they
get
in.
Let
neither
the
young
nor
the
old
MacTurk
lay
a
finger
on
me;
nor
Mr.
Greaves,
their
colleague;
and
lastly,
if
I
give
trouble,
with
your
own
hand
administer
to
me
a
strong
narcotic
such
a
sure
dose
of
laudanum
as
shall
leave
no
mistake.
Promise
to
do
this."
Moore
left
his
desk,
and
permitted
himself
the
recreation
of
one
or
two
turns
through
the
room.
Stopping
behind
Shirley's
chair,
he
bent
over
her,
and
said,
in
a
low,
emphatic
voice,
"I
promise
all
you
ask
without
comment,
without
reservation."
"If
female
help
is
needed,
call
in
my
housekeeper,
Mrs.
Gill.
Let
her
lay
me
out
if
I
die.
She
is
attached
to
me.
She
wronged
me
again
and
again,
and
again
and
again
I
forgave
her.
She
now
loves
me,
and
would
not
defraud
me
of
a
pin.
Confidence
has
made
her
honest;
forbearance
has
made
her
kind
hearted.
At
this
day
I
can
trust
both
her
integrity,
her
courage,
and
her
affection.
Call
her;
but
keep
my
good
aunt
and
my
timid
cousins
away.
Once
more,
promise."
"I
promise."
"That
is
good
in
you,"
she
said,
looking
up
at
him
as
he
bent
over
her,
and
smiling.
"Is
it
good?
Does
it
comfort?"
"Very
much."
"I
will
be
with
you
I
and
Mrs.
Gill
only
in
any,
in
every
extremity
where
calm
and
fidelity
are
needed.
No
rash
or
coward
hand
shall
meddle."
"Yet
you
think
me
childish?"
"I
do."
"Ah!
you
despise
me."
