through
the
trees;
her
hair
flows
plenteous,
long,
and
glossy;
her
eyes,
not
dazzled
by
vertical
fires,
beam
in
the
shade
large
and
open,
and
full
and
dewy.
Above
those
eyes,
when
the
breeze
bares
her
forehead,
shines
an
expanse
fair
and
ample
a
clear,
candid
page,
whereon
knowledge,
should
knowledge
ever
come,
might
write
a
golden
record.
You
see
in
the
desolate
young
savage
nothing
vicious
or
vacant.
She
haunts
the
wood
harmless
and
thoughtful,
though
of
what
one
so
untaught
can
think
it
is
not
easy
to
divine.
On
the
evening
of
one
summer
day,
before
the
Flood,
being
utterly
alone
for
she
had
lost
all
trace
of
her
tribe,
who
had
wandered
leagues
away,
she
knew
not
where
she
went
up
from
the
vale,
to
watch
Day
take
leave
and
Night
arrive.
A
crag
overspread
by
a
tree
was
her
station.
The
oak
roots,
turfed
and
mossed,
gave
a
seat;
the
oak
boughs,
thick
leaved,
wove
a
canopy.
Slow
and
grand
the
Day
withdrew,
passing
in
purple
fire,
and
parting
to
the
farewell
of
a
wild,
low
chorus
from
the
woodlands.
Then
Night
entered,
quiet
as
death.
The
wind
fell,
the
birds
ceased
singing.
Now
every
nest
held
happy
mates,
and
hart
and
hind
slumbered
blissfully
safe
in
their
lair.
The
girl
sat,
her
body
still,
her
soul
astir;
occupied,
however,
rather
in
feeling
than
in
thinking,
in
wishing
than
hoping,
in
imagining
than
projecting.
She
felt
the
world,
the
sky,
the
night,
boundlessly
mighty.
Of
all
things
herself
seemed
to
herself
the
centre
a
small,
forgotten
atom
of
life,
a
spark
of
soul,
emitted
inadvertent
from
the
great
creative
source,
and
now
burning
unmarked
to
waste
in
the
heart
of
a
black
hollow.
She
asked,
was
she
thus
to
burn
out
and
perish,
her
living
light
doing
no
good,
never
seen,
never
needed
a
star
in
an
else
starless
firmament,
which
nor
shepherd,
nor
wanderer,
nor
sage,
nor
priest
tracked
as
a
guide
or
read
as
a
prophecy?
Could
this
be,
she
demanded,
when
the
flame
of
her
intelligence
burned
so
vivid;
when
her
life
beat
so
true,
and
real,
and
potent;
when
something
within
her
stirred
disquieted,
and
restlessly
asserted
a
God
given
strength,
for
which
it
insisted
she
should
find
exercise?
She
gazed
abroad
on
Heaven
and
Evening.
Heaven
and
Evening
gazed
back
on
her.
She
bent
down,
searching
bank,
hill,
river,
spread
dim
below.
All
she
questioned
responded
by
oracles.
She
heard
she
was
impressed;
but
she
could
not
understand.
Above
her
head
she
raised
her
hands
joined
together.
"Guidance
help
comfort
come!"
was
her
cry.
There
was
no
voice,
nor
any
that
answered.
She
waited,
kneeling,
steadfastly
looking
up.
Yonder
sky
was
sealed;
the
solemn
stars
shone
alien
and
remote.
At
last
one
overstretched
chord
of
her
agony
slacked;
she
thought
Something
above
relented;
she
felt
as
if
Something
far
round
drew
nigher;
she
heard
as
if
Silence
spoke.
There
was
no
language,
no
word,
only
a
tone.
Again
a
fine,
full,
