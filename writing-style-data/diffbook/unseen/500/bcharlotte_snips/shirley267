and
she
looks,
I
suppose,
to
the
bliss
of
the
world
to
come.
So
do
nuns,
with
their
close
cell,
their
iron
lamp,
their
robe
strait
as
a
shroud,
their
bed
narrow
as
a
coffin.
She
says
often
she
has
no
fear
of
death
no
dread
of
the
grave;
no
more,
doubtless,
had
St.
Simeon
Stylites,
lifted
up
terrible
on
his
wild
column
in
the
wilderness;
no
more
has
the
Hindu
votary
stretched
on
his
couch
of
iron
spikes.
Both
these
having
violated
nature,
their
natural
likings
and
antipathies
are
reversed;
they
grow
altogether
morbid.
I
do
fear
death
as
yet,
but
I
believe
it
is
because
I
am
young.
Poor
Miss
Ainley
would
cling
closer
to
life
if
life
had
more
charms
for
her.
God
surely
did
not
create
us
and
cause
us
to
live
with
the
sole
end
of
wishing
always
to
die.
I
believe
in
my
heart
we
were
intended
to
prize
life
and
enjoy
it
so
long
as
we
retain
it.
Existence
never
was
originally
meant
to
be
that
useless,
blank,
pale,
slow
trailing
thing
it
often
becomes
to
many,
and
is
becoming
to
me
among
the
rest.
"Nobody,"
she
went
on
"nobody
in
particular
is
to
blame,
that
I
can
see,
for
the
state
in
which
things
are;
and
I
cannot
tell,
however
much
I
puzzle
over
it,
how
they
are
to
be
altered
for
the
better;
but
I
feel
there
is
something
wrong
somewhere.
I
believe
single
women
should
have
more
to
do
better
chances
of
interesting
and
profitable
occupation
than
they
possess
now.
And
when
I
speak
thus
I
have
no
impression
that
I
displease
God
by
my
words;
that
I
am
either
impious
or
impatient,
irreligious
or
sacrilegious.
My
consolation
is,
indeed,
that
God
hears
many
a
groan,
and
compassionates
much
grief
which
man
stops
his
ears
against,
or
frowns
on
with
impotent
contempt.
I
say
impotent,
for
I
observe
that
to
such
grievances
as
society
cannot
readily
cure
it
usually
forbids
utterance,
on
pain
of
its
scorn,
this
scorn
being
only
a
sort
of
tinselled
cloak
to
its
deformed
weakness.
People
hate
to
be
reminded
of
ills
they
are
unable
or
unwilling
to
remedy.
Such
reminder,
in
forcing
on
them
a
sense
of
their
own
incapacity,
or
a
more
painful
sense
of
an
obligation
to
make
some
unpleasant
effort,
troubles
their
ease
and
shakes
their
self
complacency.
Old
maids,
like
the
houseless
and
unemployed
poor,
should
not
ask
for
a
place
and
an
occupation
in
the
world;
the
demand
disturbs
the
happy
and
rich
it
disturbs
parents.
Look
at
the
numerous
families
of
girls
in
this
neighbourhood
the
Armitages,
the
Birtwhistles,
the
Sykeses.
The
brothers
of
these
girls
are
every
one
in
business
or
in
professions;
they
have
something
to
do.
Their
sisters
have
no
earthly
employment
but
household
work
and
sewing,
no
earthly
pleasure
but
an
unprofitable
visiting,
and
no
hope,
in
all
their
life
to
come,
of
anything
better.
This
stagnant
state
of
things
makes
them
decline
in
health.
