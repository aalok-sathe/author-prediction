indicate
his
mind.
If
you
expect
to
be
treated
to
a
Perfection,
reader,
or
even
to
a
benevolent,
philanthropic
old
gentleman
in
him,
you
are
mistaken.
He
has
spoken
with
some
sense
and
with
some
good
feeling
to
Mr.
Moore,
but
you
are
not
thence
to
conclude
that
he
always
spoke
and
thought
justly
and
kindly.
Mr.
Yorke,
in
the
first
place,
was
without
the
organ
of
veneration
a
great
want,
and
which
throws
a
man
wrong
on
every
point
where
veneration
is
required.
Secondly,
he
was
without
the
organ
of
comparison
a
deficiency
which
strips
a
man
of
sympathy;
and
thirdly,
he
had
too
little
of
the
organs
of
benevolence
and
ideality,
which
took
the
glory
and
softness
from
his
nature,
and
for
him
diminished
those
divine
qualities
throughout
the
universe.
The
want
of
veneration
made
him
intolerant
to
those
above
him
kings
and
nobles
and
priests,
dynasties
and
parliaments
and
establishments,
with
all
their
doings,
most
of
their
enactments,
their
forms,
their
rights,
their
claims,
were
to
him
an
abomination,
all
rubbish;
he
found
no
use
or
pleasure
in
them,
and
believed
it
would
be
clear
gain,
and
no
damage
to
the
world,
if
its
high
places
were
razed,
and
their
occupants
crushed
in
the
fall.
The
want
of
veneration,
too,
made
him
dead
at
heart
to
the
electric
delight
of
admiring
what
is
admirable;
it
dried
up
a
thousand
pure
sources
of
enjoyment;
it
withered
a
thousand
vivid
pleasures.
He
was
not
irreligious,
though
a
member
of
no
sect;
but
his
religion
could
not
be
that
of
one
who
knows
how
to
venerate.
He
believed
in
God
and
heaven;
but
his
God
and
heaven
were
those
of
a
man
in
whom
awe,
imagination,
and
tenderness
lack.
The
weakness
of
his
powers
of
comparison
made
him
inconsistent;
while
he
professed
some
excellent
general
doctrines
of
mutual
toleration
and
forbearance,
he
cherished
towards
certain
classes
a
bigoted
antipathy.
He
spoke
of
"parsons"
and
all
who
belonged
to
parsons,
of
"lords"
and
the
appendages
of
lords,
with
a
harshness,
sometimes
an
insolence,
as
unjust
as
it
was
insufferable.
He
could
not
place
himself
in
the
position
of
those
he
vituperated;
he
could
not
compare
their
errors
with
their
temptations,
their
defects
with
their
disadvantages;
he
could
not
realize
the
effect
of
such
and
such
circumstances
on
himself
similarly
situated,
and
he
would
often
express
the
most
ferocious
and
tyrannical
wishes
regarding
those
who
had
acted,
as
he
thought,
ferociously
and
tyrannically.
To
judge
by
his
threats,
he
would
have
employed
arbitrary,
even
cruel,
means
to
advance
the
cause
of
freedom
and
equality.
Equality!
yes,
Mr.
Yorke
talked
about
equality,
but
at
heart
he
was
a
proud
man
very
friendly
to
his
workpeople,
very
good
to
all
who
were
beneath
him,
and
submitted
quietly
to
be
beneath
him,
but
haughty
as
Beelzebub
to
whomsoever
the
world
deemed
(for
he
deemed
no
man)
his
superior.
Revolt
was
in
his
blood:
he
could
not
bear
control;
his
father,
his
grandfather
before
him,
could
