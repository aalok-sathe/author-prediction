already
have.
Celibacy
has
been
mine
for
thirty
years.
If
you
wish
to
offer
me
a
gift,
a
parting
present,
a
keepsake,
you
must
change
the
boon.'
"'Take
worse,
then!'
"'How
what?'
"I
now
felt,
and
looked,
and
spoke
eagerly.
I
was
unwise
to
quit
my
sheet
anchor
of
calm
even
for
an
instant;
it
deprived
me
of
an
advantage
and
transferred
it
to
her.
The
little
spark
of
temper
dissolved
in
sarcasm,
and
eddied
over
her
countenance
in
the
ripples
of
a
mocking
smile.
"'Take
a
wife
that
has
paid
you
court
to
save
your
modesty,
and
thrust
herself
upon
you
to
spare
your
scruples.'
"'Only
show
me
where.'
"'Any
stout
widow
that
has
had
a
few
husbands
already,
and
can
manage
these
things.'
"'She
must
not
be
rich,
then.
Oh
these
riches!'
"'Never
would
you
have
gathered
the
produce
of
the
gold
bearing
garden.
You
have
not
courage
to
confront
the
sleepless
dragon;
you
have
not
craft
to
borrow
the
aid
of
Atlas.'
"'You
look
hot
and
haughty.'
"'And
you
far
haughtier.
Yours
is
the
monstrous
pride
which
counterfeits
humility.'
"'I
am
a
dependant;
I
know
my
place.'
"'I
am
a
woman;
I
know
mine.'
"'I
am
poor;
I
must
be
proud.'
"'I
have
received
ordinances,
and
own
obligations
stringent
as
yours.'
"We
had
reached
a
critical
point
now,
and
we
halted
and
looked
at
each
other.
She
would
not
give
in,
I
felt.
Beyond
this
I
neither
felt
nor
saw.
A
few
moments
yet
were
mine.
The
end
was
coming
I
heard
its
rush
but
not
come.
I
would
dally,
wait,
talk,
and
when
impulse
urged
I
would
act.
I
am
never
in
a
hurry;
I
never
was
in
a
hurry
in
my
whole
life.
Hasty
people
drink
the
nectar
of
existence
scalding
hot;
I
taste
it
cool
as
dew.
I
proceeded:
'Apparently,
Miss
Keeldar,
you
are
as
little
likely
to
marry
as
myself.
I
know
you
have
refused
three
nay,
four
advantageous
offers,
and,
I
believe,
a
fifth.
Have
you
rejected
Sir
Philip
Nunnely?'
"I
put
this
question
suddenly
and
promptly.
"'Did
you
think
I
should
take
him?'
"'I
thought
you
might.'
"'On
what
grounds,
may
I
ask?'
"'Conformity
of
rank,
age,
pleasing
contrast
of
temper
for
he
is
mild
and
amiable
harmony
of
intellectual
tastes.'
"'A
beautiful
sentence!
Let
us
take
it
to
pieces.
"Conformity
of
rank."
He
is
quite
above
me.
Compare
my
grange
with
his
palace,
if
you
please.
I
am
disdained
by
his
kith
and
kin.
"Suitability
of
age."
We
were
born
in
the
same
year;
consequently
he
is
still
a
boy,
while
I
am
a
woman
ten
years
his
senior
to
all
intents
and
purposes.
"Contrast
of
temper."
Mild
and
amiable,
is
he;
I
what?
Tell
me.'
"'Sister
of
the
spotted,
bright,
quick,
fiery
leopard.'
"'And
you
would
mate
me
with
a
kid
the
millennium
being
yet
millions
of
centuries
from
mankind;
being
yet,
indeed,
an
archangel
high
in
the
seventh
heaven,
uncommissioned
to
descend?
Unjust
barbarian!
"Harmony
of
intellectual
tastes."
