deviation
with
lynx
eyed
vigilance,
and
were
ready,
the
one
with
his
cane,
the
other
with
her
parasol,
to
rebuke
the
slightest
breach
of
orders,
the
least
independent
or
irregular
demonstration
that
the
body
of
Dissenters
were
first
amazed,
then
alarmed,
then
borne
down
and
pressed
back,
and
at
last
forced
to
turn
tail
and
leave
the
outlet
from
Royd
Lane
free.
Boultby
suffered
in
the
onslaught,
but
Helstone
and
Malone,
between
them,
held
him
up,
and
brought
him
through
the
business,
whole
in
limb,
though
sorely
tried
in
wind.
The
fat
Dissenter
who
had
given
out
the
hymn
was
left
sitting
in
the
ditch.
He
was
a
spirit
merchant
by
trade,
a
leader
of
the
Nonconformists,
and,
it
was
said,
drank
more
water
in
that
one
afternoon
than
he
had
swallowed
for
a
twelvemonth
before.
Mr.
Hall
had
taken
care
of
Caroline,
and
Caroline
of
him.
He
and
Miss
Ainley
made
their
own
quiet
comments
to
each
other
afterwards
on
the
incident.
Miss
Keeldar
and
Mr.
Helstone
shook
hands
heartily
when
they
had
fairly
got
the
whole
party
through
the
lane.
The
curates
began
to
exult,
but
Mr.
Helstone
presently
put
the
curb
on
their
innocent
spirits.
He
remarked
that
they
never
had
sense
to
know
what
to
say,
and
had
better
hold
their
tongues;
and
he
reminded
them
that
the
business
was
none
of
their
managing.
About
half
past
three
the
procession
turned
back,
and
at
four
once
more
regained
the
starting
place.
Long
lines
of
benches
were
arranged
in
the
close
shorn
fields
round
the
school.
There
the
children
were
seated,
and
huge
baskets,
covered
up
with
white
cloths,
and
great
smoking
tin
vessels
were
brought
out.
Ere
the
distribution
of
good
things
commenced,
a
brief
grace
was
pronounced
by
Mr.
Hall
and
sung
by
the
children.
Their
young
voices
sounded
melodious,
even
touching,
in
the
open
air.
Large
currant
buns
and
hot,
well
sweetened
tea
were
then
administered
in
the
proper
spirit
of
liberality.
No
stinting
was
permitted
on
this
day,
at
least;
the
rule
for
each
child's
allowance
being
that
it
was
to
have
about
twice
as
much
as
it
could
possibly
eat,
thus
leaving
a
reserve
to
be
carried
home
for
such
as
age,
sickness,
or
other
impediment
prevented
from
coming
to
the
feast.
Buns
and
beer
circulated,
meantime,
amongst
the
musicians
and
church
singers;
afterwards
the
benches
were
removed,
and
they
were
left
to
unbend
their
spirits
in
licensed
play.
A
bell
summoned
the
teachers,
patrons,
and
patronesses
to
the
schoolroom.
Miss
Keeldar,
Miss
Helstone,
and
many
other
ladies
were
already
there,
glancing
over
the
arrangement
of
their
separate
trays
and
tables.
Most
of
the
female
servants
of
the
neighbourhood,
together
with
the
clerks',
the
singers',
and
the
musicians'
wives,
had
been
pressed
into
the
service
of
the
day
as
waiters.
Each
vied
with
the
other
in
smartness
and
daintiness
of
dress,
and
many
handsome
forms
were
seen
amongst
the
younger
ones.
About
half
a
score
were
cutting
bread
and
butter,
another
half
