that
chair,
Mr.
Yorke?"
asked
Moore,
lazily
vacating
the
place
in
obedience
to
orders.
"My
father
war
afore
me,
and
that's
all
t'
answer
I
sall
gie
thee;
and
it's
as
good
a
reason
as
Mr.
Helstone
can
give
for
the
main
feck
o'
his
notions."
"Moore,
are
you
ready
to
go?"
inquired
the
rector.
"Nay;
Robert's
not
ready,
or
rather,
I'm
not
ready
to
part
wi'
him.
He's
an
ill
lad,
and
wants
correcting."
"Why,
sir?
What
have
I
done?"
"Made
thyself
enemies
on
every
hand."
"What
do
I
care
for
that?
What
difference
does
it
make
to
me
whether
your
Yorkshire
louts
hate
me
or
like
me?"
"Ay,
there
it
is.
The
lad
is
a
mak'
of
an
alien
amang
us.
His
father
would
never
have
talked
i'
that
way.
Go
back
to
Antwerp,
where
you
were
born
and
bred,
mauvaise
tete!"
"Mauvaise
tete
vous
meme;
je
ne
fais
que
mon
devoir;
quant
a
vos
lourdauds
de
paysans,
je
m'en
moque!"
"En
ravanche,
mon
garcon,
nos
lourdauds
de
paysans
se
moqueront
de
toi;
sois
en
certain,"
replied
Yorke,
speaking
with
nearly
as
pure
a
French
accent
as
Gerard
Moore.
"C'est
bon!
c'est
bon!
Et
puisque
cela
m'est
egal,
que
mes
amis
ne
s'en
inquietent
pas."
"Tes
amis!
Ou
sont
ils,
tes
amis?"
"Je
fais
echo,
ou
sont
ils?
et
je
suis
fort
aise
que
l'echo
seul
y
repond.
Au
diable
les
amis!
Je
me
souviens
encore
du
moment
ou
mon
pere
et
mes
oncles
Gerard
appellerent
autour
d'eux
leurs
amis,
et
Dieu
sait
si
les
amis
se
sont
empresses
d'accourir
a
leur
secours!
Tenez,
M.
Yorke,
ce
mot,
ami,
m'irrite
trop;
ne
m'en
parlez
plus."
"Comme
tu
voudras."
And
here
Mr.
Yorke
held
his
peace;
and
while
he
sits
leaning
back
in
his
three
cornered
carved
oak
chair,
I
will
snatch
my
opportunity
to
sketch
the
portrait
of
this
French
speaking
Yorkshire
gentleman.
A
Yorkshire
gentleman
he
was,
par
excellence,
in
every
point;
about
fifty
five
years
old,
but
looking
at
first
sight
still
older,
for
his
hair
was
silver
white.
His
forehead
was
broad,
not
high;
his
face
fresh
and
hale;
the
harshness
of
the
north
was
seen
in
his
features,
as
it
was
heard
in
his
voice;
every
trait
was
thoroughly
English
not
a
Norman
line
anywhere;
it
was
an
inelegant,
unclassic,
unaristocratic
mould
of
visage.
Fine
people
would
perhaps
have
called
it
vulgar;
sensible
people
would
have
termed
it
characteristic;
shrewd
people
would
have
delighted
in
it
for
the
pith,
sagacity,
intelligence,
the
rude
yet
real
originality
marked
in
every
lineament,
latent
in
every
furrow.
But
it
was
an
indocile,
a
scornful,
and
a
sarcastic
face
the
face
of
a
man
difficult
to
lead,
and
impossible
to
drive.
His
stature
was
rather
tall,
and
he
was
well
made
and
wiry,
and
had
a
stately
integrity
of
port;
there
was
not
a
suspicion
of
the
clown
about
him
anywhere.
I
did
not
find
it
easy
to
sketch
Mr.
Yorke's
person,
but
it
is
more
difficult
to
