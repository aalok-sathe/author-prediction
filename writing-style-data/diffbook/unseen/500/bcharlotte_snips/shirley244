risked
their
lives
in
defence
of
my
property:
I
suppose
they
have
a
right
to
my
gratitude.
The
wounded
are
our
fellow
creatures:
I
suppose
we
should
aid
them.
Mrs.
Gill!"
She
turned,
and
called
in
a
voice
more
clear
than
soft.
It
rang
through
the
thick
oak
of
the
hall
and
kitchen
doors
more
effectually
than
a
bell's
summons.
Mrs.
Gill,
who
was
deep
in
bread
making,
came
with
hands
and
apron
in
culinary
case,
not
having
dared
to
stop
to
rub
the
dough
from
the
one
or
to
shake
the
flour
from
the
other.
Her
mistress
had
never
called
a
servant
in
that
voice
save
once
before,
and
that
was
when
she
had
seen
from
the
window
Tartar
in
full
tug
with
two
carriers'
dogs,
each
of
them
a
match
for
him
in
size,
if
not
in
courage,
and
their
masters
standing
by,
encouraging
their
animals,
while
hers
was
unbefriended.
Then
indeed
she
had
summoned
John
as
if
the
Day
of
Judgment
were
at
hand.
Nor
had
she
waited
for
the
said
John's
coming,
but
had
walked
out
into
the
lane
bonnetless,
and
after
informing
the
carriers
that
she
held
them
far
less
of
men
than
the
three
brutes
whirling
and
worrying
in
the
dust
before
them,
had
put
her
hands
round
the
thick
neck
of
the
largest
of
the
curs,
and
given
her
whole
strength
to
the
essay
of
choking
it
from
Tartar's
torn
and
bleeding
eye,
just
above
and
below
which
organ
the
vengeful
fangs
were
inserted.
Five
or
six
men
were
presently
on
the
spot
to
help
her,
but
she
never
thanked
one
of
them.
"They
might
have
come
before
if
their
will
had
been
good,"
she
said.
She
had
not
a
word
for
anybody
during
the
rest
of
the
day,
but
sat
near
the
hall
fire
till
evening
watching
and
tending
Tartar,
who
lay
all
gory,
stiff,
and
swelled
on
a
mat
at
her
feet.
She
wept
furtively
over
him
sometimes,
and
murmured
the
softest
words
of
pity
and
endearment,
in
tones
whose
music
the
old,
scarred,
canine
warrior
acknowledged
by
licking
her
hand
or
her
sandal
alternately
with
his
own
red
wounds.
As
to
John,
his
lady
turned
a
cold
shoulder
on
him
for
a
week
afterwards.
Mrs.
Gill,
remembering
this
little
episode,
came
"all
of
a
tremble,"
as
she
said
herself.
In
a
firm,
brief
voice
Miss
Keeldar
proceeded
to
put
questions
and
give
orders.
That
at
such
a
time
Fieldhead
should
have
evinced
the
inhospitality
of
a
miser's
hovel
stung
her
haughty
spirit
to
the
quick;
and
the
revolt
of
its
pride
was
seen
in
the
heaving
of
her
heart,
stirred
stormily
under
the
lace
and
silk
which
veiled
it.
"How
long
is
it
since
that
message
came
from
the
mill?"
"Not
an
hour
yet,
ma'am,"
answered
the
housekeeper
soothingly.
"Not
an
hour!
You
might
almost
as
well
have
said
not
a
day.
They
will
have
applied
elsewhere
by
this
time.
Send
a
man
instantly
down
to
tell
them
that
everything
