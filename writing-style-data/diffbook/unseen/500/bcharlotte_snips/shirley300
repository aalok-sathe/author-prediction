As
for
Robert,
from
Birmingham
he
had
gone
on
to
London,
where
he
still
sojourned.
So
long
as
the
breath
of
Asiatic
deserts
parched
Caroline's
lips
and
fevered
her
veins,
her
physical
convalescence
could
not
keep
pace
with
her
returning
mental
tranquillity;
but
there
came
a
day
when
the
wind
ceased
to
sob
at
the
eastern
gable
of
the
rectory,
and
at
the
oriel
window
of
the
church.
A
little
cloud
like
a
man's
hand
arose
in
the
west;
gusts
from
the
same
quarter
drove
it
on
and
spread
it
wide;
wet
and
tempest
prevailed
a
while.
When
that
was
over
the
sun
broke
out
genially,
heaven
regained
its
azure,
and
earth
its
green;
the
livid
cholera
tint
had
vanished
from
the
face
of
nature;
the
hills
rose
clear
round
the
horizon,
absolved
from
that
pale
malaria
haze.
Caroline's
youth
could
now
be
of
some
avail
to
her,
and
so
could
her
mother's
nurture.
Both,
crowned
by
God's
blessing,
sent
in
the
pure
west
wind
blowing
soft
as
fresh
through
the
ever
open
chamber
lattice,
rekindled
her
long
languishing
energies.
At
last
Mrs.
Pryor
saw
that
it
was
permitted
to
hope:
a
genuine,
material
convalescence
had
commenced.
It
was
not
merely
Caroline's
smile
which
was
brighter,
or
her
spirits
which
were
cheered,
but
a
certain
look
had
passed
from
her
face
and
eye
a
look
dread
and
indescribable,
but
which
will
easily
be
recalled
by
those
who
have
watched
the
couch
of
dangerous
disease.
Long
before
the
emaciated
outlines
of
her
aspect
began
to
fill,
or
its
departed
colour
to
return,
a
more
subtle
change
took
place;
all
grew
softer
and
warmer.
Instead
of
a
marble
mask
and
glassy
eye,
Mrs.
Pryor
saw
laid
on
the
pillow
a
face
pale
and
wasted
enough,
perhaps
more
haggard
than
the
other
appearance,
but
less
awful;
for
it
was
a
sick,
living
girl,
not
a
mere
white
mould
or
rigid
piece
of
statuary.
Now,
too,
she
was
not
always
petitioning
to
drink.
The
words,
"I
am
so
thirsty,"
ceased
to
be
her
plaint.
Sometimes,
when
she
had
swallowed
a
morsel,
she
would
say
it
had
revived
her.
All
descriptions
of
food
were
no
longer
equally
distasteful;
she
could
be
induced,
sometimes,
to
indicate
a
preference.
With
what
trembling
pleasure
and
anxious
care
did
not
her
nurse
prepare
what
was
selected!
How
she
watched
her
as
she
partook
of
it!
Nourishment
brought
strength.
She
could
sit
up.
Then
she
longed
to
breathe
the
fresh
air,
to
revisit
her
flowers,
to
see
how
the
fruit
had
ripened.
Her
uncle,
always
liberal,
had
bought
a
garden
chair
for
her
express
use.
He
carried
her
down
in
his
own
arms,
and
placed
her
in
it
himself,
and
William
Farren
was
there
to
wheel
her
round
the
walks,
to
show
her
what
he
had
done
amongst
her
plants,
to
take
her
directions
for
further
work.
William
and
she
found
plenty
to
talk
about.
They
had
a
dozen
topics
in
common
interesting
to
them,
unimportant
to
the
rest
of
