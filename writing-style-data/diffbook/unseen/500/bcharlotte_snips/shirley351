to
it
all
mute,
but
majestic.
"Since
that
day
I
called
S.
to
me
in
the
schoolroom,
and
she
came
and
sat
so
near
my
side;
since
she
opened
the
trouble
of
her
mind
to
me,
asked
my
protection,
appealed
to
my
strength
since
that
hour
I
abhor
Solitude.
Cold
abstraction,
fleshless
skeleton,
daughter,
mother,
and
mate
of
Death!
"It
is
pleasant
to
write
about
what
is
near
and
dear
as
the
core
of
my
heart.
None
can
deprive
me
of
this
little
book,
and
through
this
pencil
I
can
say
to
it
what
I
will
say
what
I
dare
utter
to
nothing
living
say
what
I
dare
not
think
aloud.
"We
have
scarcely
encountered
each
other
since
that
evening.
Once,
when
I
was
alone
in
the
drawing
room,
seeking
a
book
of
Henry's,
she
entered,
dressed
for
a
concert
at
Stilbro'.
Shyness
her
shyness,
not
mine
drew
a
silver
veil
between
us.
Much
cant
have
I
heard
and
read
about
'maiden
modesty,'
but,
properly
used,
and
not
hackneyed,
the
words
are
good
and
appropriate
words.
As
she
passed
to
the
window,
after
tacitly
but
gracefully
recognizing
me,
I
could
call
her
nothing
in
my
own
mind
save
'stainless
virgin.'
To
my
perception,
a
delicate
splendour
robed
her,
and
the
modesty
of
girlhood
was
her
halo.
I
may
be
the
most
fatuous,
as
I
am
one
of
the
plainest,
of
men,
but
in
truth
that
shyness
of
hers
touched
me
exquisitely;
it
flattered
my
finest
sensations.
I
looked
a
stupid
block,
I
dare
say.
I
was
alive
with
a
life
of
Paradise,
as
she
turned
her
glance
from
my
glance,
and
softly
averted
her
head
to
hide
the
suffusion
of
her
cheek.
"I
know
this
is
the
talk
of
a
dreamer
of
a
rapt,
romantic
lunatic.
I
do
dream.
I
will
dream
now
and
then;
and
if
she
has
inspired
romance
into
my
prosaic
composition,
how
can
I
help
it?
"What
a
child
she
is
sometimes!
What
an
unsophisticated,
untaught
thing!
I
see
her
now
looking
up
into
my
face,
and
entreating
me
to
prevent
them
from
smothering
her,
and
to
be
sure
and
give
her
a
strong
narcotic.
I
see
her
confessing
that
she
was
not
so
self
sufficing,
so
independent
of
sympathy,
as
people
thought.
I
see
the
secret
tear
drop
quietly
from
her
eyelash.
She
said
I
thought
her
childish,
and
I
did.
She
imagined
I
despised
her.
Despised
her!
It
was
unutterably
sweet
to
feel
myself
at
once
near
her
and
above
her
to
be
conscious
of
a
natural
right
and
power
to
sustain
her,
as
a
husband
should
sustain
his
wife.
"I
worship
her
perfections;
but
it
is
her
faults,
or
at
least
her
foibles,
that
bring
her
near
to
me,
that
nestle
her
to
my
heart,
that
fold
her
about
with
my
love,
and
that
for
a
most
selfish
but
deeply
natural
reason.
These
faults
are
the
steps
by
which
I
mount
to
ascendency
over
her.
If
she
rose
a
trimmed,
artificial
mound,
