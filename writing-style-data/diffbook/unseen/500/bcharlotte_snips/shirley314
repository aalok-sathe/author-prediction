to
my
prophecy
you
will
be
an
author,
perhaps
a
poet."
"An
author!
It
is
a
flash
a
flash
of
light
to
me!
I
will
I
will!
I'll
write
a
book
that
I
may
dedicate
it
to
you."
"You
will
write
it
that
you
may
give
your
soul
its
natural
release.
Bless
me!
what
am
I
saying?
more
than
I
understand,
I
believe,
or
can
make
good.
Here,
Hal
here
is
your
toasted
oatcake;
eat
and
live!"
"Willingly!"
here
cried
a
voice
outside
the
open
window.
"I
know
that
fragrance
of
meal
bread.
Miss
Keeldar,
may
I
come
in
and
partake?"
"Mr.
Hall"
it
was
Mr.
Hall,
and
with
him
was
Louis
Moore,
returned
from
their
walk
"there
is
a
proper
luncheon
laid
out
in
the
dining
room
and
there
are
proper
people
seated
round
it.
You
may
join
that
society
and
share
that
fare
if
you
please;
but
if
your
ill
regulated
tastes
lead
you
to
prefer
ill
regulated
proceedings,
step
in
here,
and
do
as
we
do."
"I
approve
the
perfume,
and
therefore
shall
suffer
myself
to
be
led
by
the
nose,"
returned
Mr.
Hall,
who
presently
entered,
accompanied
by
Louis
Moore.
That
gentleman's
eye
fell
on
his
desk,
pillaged.
"Burglars!"
said
he.
"Henry,
you
merit
the
ferule."
"Give
it
to
Shirley
and
Caroline;
they
did
it,"
was
alleged,
with
more
attention
to
effect
than
truth.
"Traitor
and
false
witness!"
cried
both
the
girls.
"We
never
laid
hands
on
a
thing,
except
in
the
spirit
of
laudable
inquiry!"
"Exactly
so,"
said
Moore,
with
his
rare
smile.
"And
what
have
you
ferreted
out,
in
your
'spirit
of
laudable
inquiry'?"
He
perceived
the
inner
drawer
open.
"This
is
empty,"
said
he.
"Who
has
taken
"
"Here,
here!"
Caroline
hastened
to
say,
and
she
restored
the
little
packet
to
its
place.
He
shut
it
up;
he
locked
it
in
with
a
small
key
attached
to
his
watch
guard;
he
restored
the
other
papers
to
order,
closed
the
repository,
and
sat
down
without
further
remark.
"I
thought
you
would
have
scolded
much
more,
sir,"
said
Henry.
"The
girls
deserve
reprimand."
"I
leave
them
to
their
own
consciences."
"It
accuses
them
of
crimes
intended
as
well
as
perpetrated,
sir.
If
I
had
not
been
here,
they
would
have
treated
your
portfolio
as
they
have
done
your
desk;
but
I
told
them
it
was
padlocked."
"And
will
you
have
lunch
with
us?"
here
interposed
Shirley,
addressing
Moore,
and
desirous,
as
it
seemed,
to
turn
the
conversation.
"Certainly,
if
I
may."
"You
will
be
restricted
to
new
milk
and
Yorkshire
oatcake."
"Va
pour
le
lait
frais!"
said
Louis.
"But
for
your
oatcake!"
and
he
made
a
grimace.
"He
cannot
eat
it,"
said
Henry.
"He
thinks
it
is
like
bran,
raised
with
sour
yeast."
"Come,
then;
by
special
dispensation
we
will
allow
him
a
few
cracknels,
but
nothing
less
homely."
The
hostess
rang
the
bell
and
gave
her
frugal
orders,
which
were
presently
executed.
She
herself
measured
out
the
milk,
and
distributed
the
bread
round
