she
has
more
intimate
opportunities
of
knowing
me.
She
sees
that
I
have
education,
intelligence,
manner,
principles
all,
in
short,
which
belongs
to
a
person
well
born
and
well
bred."
"Are
you
at
all
fond
of
her?"
"For
fond
I
cannot
say.
I
am
not
one
who
is
prone
to
take
violent
fancies,
and,
consequently,
my
friendship
is
the
more
to
be
depended
on.
I
have
a
regard
for
her
as
my
relative;
her
position
also
inspires
interest,
and
her
conduct
as
my
pupil
has
hitherto
been
such
as
rather
to
enhance
than
diminish
the
attachment
that
springs
from
other
causes."
"She
behaves
pretty
well
at
lessons?"
"To
me
she
behaves
very
well;
but
you
are
conscious,
brother,
that
I
have
a
manner
calculated
to
repel
over
familiarity,
to
win
esteem,
and
to
command
respect.
Yet,
possessed
of
penetration,
I
perceive
clearly
that
Caroline
is
not
perfect,
that
there
is
much
to
be
desired
in
her."
"Give
me
a
last
cup
of
coffee,
and
while
I
am
drinking
it
amuse
me
with
an
account
of
her
faults."
"Dear
brother,
I
am
happy
to
see
you
eat
your
breakfast
with
relish,
after
the
fatiguing
night
you
have
passed.
Caroline,
then,
is
defective;
but
with
my
forming
hand
and
almost
motherly
care
she
may
improve.
There
is
about
her
an
occasional
something
a
reserve,
I
think
which
I
do
not
quite
like,
because
it
is
not
sufficiently
girlish
and
submissive;
and
there
are
glimpses
of
an
unsettled
hurry
in
her
nature,
which
put
me
out.
Yet
she
is
usually
most
tranquil,
too
dejected
and
thoughtful
indeed
sometimes.
In
time,
I
doubt
not,
I
shall
make
her
uniformly
sedate
and
decorous,
without
being
unaccountably
pensive.
I
ever
disapprove
what
is
not
intelligible."
"I
don't
understand
your
account
in
the
least.
What
do
you
mean
by
'unsettled
hurries,'
for
instance?"
"An
example
will,
perhaps,
be
the
most
satisfactory
explanation.
I
sometimes,
you
are
aware,
make
her
read
French
poetry
by
way
of
practice
in
pronunciation.
She
has
in
the
course
of
her
lessons
gone
through
much
of
Corneille
and
Racine,
in
a
very
steady,
sober
spirit,
such
as
I
approve.
Occasionally
she
showed,
indeed,
a
degree
of
languor
in
the
perusal
of
those
esteemed
authors,
partaking
rather
of
apathy
than
sobriety;
and
apathy
is
what
I
cannot
tolerate
in
those
who
have
the
benefit
of
my
instructions
besides,
one
should
not
be
apathetic
in
studying
standard
works.
The
other
day
I
put
into
her
hands
a
volume
of
short
fugitive
pieces.
I
sent
her
to
the
window
to
learn
one
by
heart,
and
when
I
looked
up
I
saw
her
turning
the
leaves
over
impatiently,
and
curling
her
lip,
absolutely
with
scorn,
as
she
surveyed
the
little
poems
cursorily.
I
chid
her.
'Ma
cousine,'
said
she,
'tout
cela
m'ennuie
a
la
mort.'
I
told
her
this
was
improper
language.
'Dieu!'
she
exclaimed,
'il
n'y
a
donc
pas
deux
lignes
de
poesie
dans
toute
la
litterature
francaise?'
I
inquired
what
she
meant.
She
begged
my
