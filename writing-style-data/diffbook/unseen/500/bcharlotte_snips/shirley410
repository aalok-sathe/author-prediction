breakfast
this
morning,
when
I
had
seen
her,
and
listened
to
her,
and,
so
to
speak,
felt
her,
in
every
sentient
atom
of
my
frame,
I
passed
from
her
sunny
presence
into
the
chill
drawing
room.
Taking
up
a
little
gilt
volume,
I
found
it
to
contain
a
selection
of
lyrics.
I
read
a
poem
or
two;
whether
the
spell
was
in
me
or
in
the
verse
I
know
not,
but
my
heart
filled
genially,
my
pulse
rose.
I
glowed,
notwithstanding
the
frost
air.
I,
too,
am
young
as
yet.
Though
she
said
she
never
considered
me
young,
I
am
barely
thirty.
There
are
moments
when
life,
for
no
other
reason
than
my
own
youth,
beams
with
sweet
hues
upon
me.
"It
was
time
to
go
to
the
schoolroom.
I
went.
That
same
schoolroom
is
rather
pleasant
in
a
morning.
The
sun
then
shines
through
the
low
lattice;
the
books
are
in
order;
there
are
no
papers
strewn
about;
the
fire
is
clear
and
clean;
no
cinders
have
fallen,
no
ashes
accumulated.
I
found
Henry
there,
and
he
had
brought
with
him
Miss
Keeldar.
They
were
together.
"I
said
she
was
lovelier
than
ever.
She
is.
A
fine
rose,
not
deep
but
delicate,
opens
on
her
cheek.
Her
eye,
always
dark,
clear,
and
speaking,
utters
now
a
language
I
cannot
render;
it
is
the
utterance,
seen
not
heard,
through
which
angels
must
have
communed
when
there
was
'silence
in
heaven.'
Her
hair
was
always
dusk
as
night
and
fine
as
silk,
her
neck
was
always
fair,
flexible,
polished;
but
both
have
now
a
new
charm.
The
tresses
are
soft
as
shadow,
the
shoulders
they
fall
on
wear
a
goddess
grace.
Once
I
only
saw
her
beauty,
now
I
feel
it.
"Henry
was
repeating
his
lesson
to
her
before
bringing
it
to
me.
One
of
her
hands
was
occupied
with
the
book;
he
held
the
other.
That
boy
gets
more
than
his
share
of
privileges;
he
dares
caress
and
is
caressed.
What
indulgence
and
compassion
she
shows
him!
Too
much.
If
this
went
on,
Henry
in
a
few
years,
when
his
soul
was
formed,
would
offer
it
on
her
altar,
as
I
have
offered
mine.
"I
saw
her
eyelid
flitter
when
I
came
in,
but
she
did
not
look
up;
now
she
hardly
ever
gives
me
a
glance.
She
seems
to
grow
silent
too;
to
me
she
rarely
speaks,
and
when
I
am
present,
she
says
little
to
others.
In
my
gloomy
moments
I
attribute
this
change
to
indifference,
aversion,
what
not?
In
my
sunny
intervals
I
give
it
another
meaning.
I
say,
were
I
her
equal,
I
could
find
in
this
shyness
coyness,
and
in
that
coyness
love.
As
it
is,
dare
I
look
for
it?
What
could
I
do
with
it
if
found?
"This
morning
I
dared
at
least
contrive
an
hour's
communion
for
her
and
me;
I
dared
not
only
wish
but
will
an
interview
with
her.
I
dared
summon
solitude
to
guard
us.
Very
decidedly
I
called
