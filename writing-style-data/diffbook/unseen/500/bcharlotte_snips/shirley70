the
rectory
to
Hollow's
Mill
inclined
downwards;
she
ran,
therefore,
almost
all
the
way.
Exercise,
the
fresh
air,
the
thought
of
seeing
Robert,
at
least
of
being
on
his
premises,
in
his
vicinage,
revived
her
somewhat
depressed
spirits
quickly.
Arriving
in
sight
of
the
white
house,
and
within
hearing
of
the
thundering
mill
and
its
rushing
watercourse,
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
Moore
at
his
garden
gate.
There
he
stood,
in
his
belted
Holland
blouse,
a
light
cap
covering
his
head,
which
undress
costume
suited
him.
He
was
looking
down
the
lane,
not
in
the
direction
of
his
cousin's
approach.
She
stopped,
withdrawing
a
little
behind
a
willow,
and
studied
his
appearance.
"He
has
not
his
peer,"
she
thought.
"He
is
as
handsome
as
he
is
intelligent.
What
a
keen
eye
he
has!
What
clearly
cut,
spirited
features
thin
and
serious,
but
graceful!
I
do
like
his
face,
I
do
like
his
aspect,
I
do
like
him
so
much
better
than
any
of
those
shuffling
curates,
for
instance
better
than
anybody;
bonny
Robert!"
She
sought
"bonny
Robert's"
presence
speedily.
For
his
part,
when
she
challenged
his
sight,
I
believe
he
would
have
passed
from
before
her
eyes
like
a
phantom,
if
he
could;
but
being
a
tall
fact,
and
no
fiction,
he
was
obliged
to
stand
the
greeting.
He
made
it
brief.
It
was
cousin
like,
brother
like,
friend
like,
anything
but
lover
like.
The
nameless
charm
of
last
night
had
left
his
manner:
he
was
no
longer
the
same
man:
or,
at
any
rate,
the
same
heart
did
not
beat
in
his
breast.
Rude
disappointment,
sharp
cross!
At
first
the
eager
girl
would
not
believe
in
the
change,
though
she
saw
and
felt
it.
It
was
difficult
to
withdraw
her
hand
from
his,
till
he
had
bestowed
at
least
something
like
a
kind
pressure;
it
was
difficult
to
turn
her
eyes
from
his
eyes,
till
his
looks
had
expressed
something
more
and
fonder
than
that
cool
welcome.
A
lover
masculine
so
disappointed
can
speak
and
urge
explanation,
a
lover
feminine
can
say
nothing;
if
she
did,
the
result
would
be
shame
and
anguish,
inward
remorse
for
self
treachery.
Nature
would
brand
such
demonstration
as
a
rebellion
against
her
instincts,
and
would
vindictively
repay
it
afterwards
by
the
thunderbolt
of
self
contempt
smiting
suddenly
in
secret.
Take
the
matter
as
you
find
it:
ask
no
questions,
utter
no
remonstrances;
it
is
your
best
wisdom.
You
expected
bread,
and
you
have
got
a
stone:
break
your
teeth
on
it,
and
don't
shriek
because
the
nerves
are
martyrized;
do
not
doubt
that
your
mental
stomach
if
you
have
such
a
thing
is
strong
as
an
ostrich's;
the
stone
will
digest.
You
held
out
your
hand
for
an
egg,
and
fate
put
into
it
a
scorpion.
Show
no
consternation:
close
your
fingers
firmly
upon
the
gift;
let
it
sting
through
your
palm.
Never
mind;
in
time,
after
your
hand
and
arm
have
swelled
and
quivered
long
with
torture,
the
squeezed
scorpion
will
