renewed;
it
opened
upon
her.
No
sooner
had
she
regained
sufficient
strength
to
bear
a
change
of
scene
the
excitement
of
a
little
society
than
Miss
Keeldar
sued
daily
for
her
presence
at
Fieldhead.
Whether
Shirley
had
become
wearied
of
her
honoured
relatives
is
not
known.
She
did
not
say
she
was;
but
she
claimed
and
retained
Caroline
with
an
eagerness
which
proved
that
an
addition
to
that
worshipful
company
was
not
unwelcome.
The
Sympsons
were
church
people.
Of
course
the
rector's
niece
was
received
by
them
with
courtesy.
Mr.
Sympson
proved
to
be
a
man
of
spotless
respectability,
worrying
temper,
pious
principles,
and
worldly
views;
his
lady
was
a
very
good
woman
patient,
kind,
well
bred.
She
had
been
brought
up
on
a
narrow
system
of
views,
starved
on
a
few
prejudices
a
mere
handful
of
bitter
herbs;
a
few
preferences,
soaked
till
their
natural
flavour
was
extracted,
and
with
no
seasoning
added
in
the
cooking;
some
excellent
principles,
made
up
in
a
stiff
raised
crust
of
bigotry
difficult
to
digest.
Far
too
submissive
was
she
to
complain
of
this
diet
or
to
ask
for
a
crumb
beyond
it.
The
daughters
were
an
example
to
their
sex.
They
were
tall,
with
a
Roman
nose
apiece.
They
had
been
educated
faultlessly.
All
they
did
was
well
done.
History
and
the
most
solid
books
had
cultivated
their
minds.
Principles
and
opinions
they
possessed
which
could
not
be
mended.
More
exactly
regulated
lives,
feelings,
manners,
habits,
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
anywhere.
They
knew
by
heart
a
certain
young
ladies'
schoolroom
code
of
laws
on
language,
demeanour,
etc.;
themselves
never
deviated
from
its
curious
little
pragmatical
provisions,
and
they
regarded
with
secret
whispered
horror
all
deviations
in
others.
The
Abomination
of
Desolation
was
no
mystery
to
them;
they
had
discovered
that
unutterable
Thing
in
the
characteristic
others
call
Originality.
Quick
were
they
to
recognize
the
signs
of
this
evil;
and
wherever
they
saw
its
trace
whether
in
look,
word,
or
deed;
whether
they
read
it
in
the
fresh,
vigorous
style
of
a
book,
or
listened
to
it
in
interesting,
unhackneyed,
pure,
expressive
language
they
shuddered,
they
recoiled.
Danger
was
above
their
heads,
peril
about
their
steps.
What
was
this
strange
thing?
Being
unintelligible
it
must
be
bad.
Let
it
be
denounced
and
chained
up.
Henry
Sympson,
the
only
son
and
youngest
child
of
the
family,
was
a
boy
of
fifteen.
He
generally
kept
with
his
tutor.
When
he
left
him,
he
sought
his
cousin
Shirley.
This
boy
differed
from
his
sisters.
He
was
little,
lame,
and
pale;
his
large
eyes
shone
somewhat
languidly
in
a
wan
orbit.
They
were,
indeed,
usually
rather
dim,
but
they
were
capable
of
illumination.
At
times
they
could
not
only
shine,
but
blaze.
Inward
emotion
could
likewise
give
colour
to
his
cheek
and
decision
to
his
crippled
movements.
Henry's
mother
loved
him;
she
thought
his
peculiarities
were
a
mark
of
election.
He
was
not
like
other
children,
she
allowed.
She
believed
him
regenerate
a
new
