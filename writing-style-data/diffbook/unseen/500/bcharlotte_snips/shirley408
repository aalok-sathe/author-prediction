Caroline,
laughing
gleefully.
"Guess
again,
Robert;
your
blunders
are
charming."
"It
is
the
parson
Hall."
"Indeed,
no;
he
is
mine,
if
you
please."
"Yours!
Ay,
the
whole
generation
of
women
in
Briarfield
seem
to
have
made
an
idol
of
that
priest.
I
wonder
why;
he
is
bald,
sand
blind,
gray
haired."
"Fanny
will
be
here
to
fetch
me
before
you
have
solved
the
riddle,
if
you
don't
make
haste."
"I'll
guess
no
more
I
am
tired;
and
then
I
don't
care.
Miss
Keeldar
may
marry
le
grand
Turc
for
me."
"Must
I
whisper?"
"That
you
must,
and
quickly.
Here
comes
Hortense;
come
near,
a
little
nearer,
my
own
Lina.
I
care
for
the
whisper
more
than
the
words."
She
whispered.
Robert
gave
a
start,
a
flash
of
the
eye,
a
brief
laugh.
Miss
Moore
entered,
and
Sarah
followed
behind,
with
information
that
Fanny
was
come.
The
hour
of
converse
was
over.
Robert
found
a
moment
to
exchange
a
few
more
whispered
sentences.
He
was
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
as
Caroline
descended
after
putting
on
her
shawl.
"Must
I
call
Shirley
a
noble
creature
now?"
he
asked.
"If
you
wish
to
speak
the
truth,
certainly."
"Must
I
forgive
her?"
"Forgive
her?
Naughty
Robert!
Was
she
in
the
wrong,
or
were
you?"
"Must
I
at
length
love
her
downright,
Cary?"
Caroline
looked
keenly
up,
and
made
a
movement
towards
him,
something
between
the
loving
and
the
petulant.
"Only
give
the
word,
and
I'll
try
to
obey
you."
"Indeed,
you
must
not
love
her;
the
bare
idea
is
perverse."
"But
then
she
is
handsome,
peculiarly
handsome.
Hers
is
a
beauty
that
grows
on
you.
You
think
her
but
graceful
when
you
first
see
her;
you
discover
her
to
be
beautiful
when
you
have
known
her
for
a
year."
"It
is
not
you
who
are
to
say
these
things.
Now,
Robert,
be
good."
"O
Cary,
I
have
no
love
to
give.
Were
the
goddess
of
beauty
to
woo
me,
I
could
not
meet
her
advances.
There
is
no
heart
which
I
can
call
mine
in
this
breast."
"So
much
the
better;
you
are
a
great
deal
safer
without.
Good
night."
"Why
must
you
always
go,
Lina,
at
the
very
instant
when
I
most
want
you
to
stay?"
"Because
you
most
wish
to
retain
when
you
are
most
certain
to
lose."
"Listen;
one
other
word.
Take
care
of
your
own
heart
do
you
hear
me?"
"There
is
no
danger."
"I
am
not
convinced
of
that.
The
Platonic
parson,
for
instance."
"Who
Malone?"
"Cyril
Hall.
I
owe
more
than
one
twinge
of
jealousy
to
that
quarter."
"As
to
you,
you
have
been
flirting
with
Miss
Mann.
She
showed
me
the
other
day
a
plant
you
had
given
her.
Fanny,
I
am
ready."
Louis
Moore's
doubts
respecting
the
immediate
evacuation
of
Fieldhead
by
Mr.
Sympson
turned
out
to
be
perfectly
well
founded.
The
very
next
day
after
the
grand
quarrel
about
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
a
sort
of
reconciliation
was
patched
up
between
uncle
and
