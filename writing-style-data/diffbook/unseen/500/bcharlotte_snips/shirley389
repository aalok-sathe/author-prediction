for
the
wood.
It
was
yet
but
half
past
three.
It
had
been
a
fine
morning,
but
the
sky
looked
dark
now.
It
was
beginning
to
snow;
the
wind
blew
cold;
the
wood
looked
dismal,
the
old
tree
grim.
Yet
Martin
approved
the
shadow
on
his
path.
He
found
a
charm
in
the
spectral
aspect
of
the
doddered
oak.
He
had
to
wait.
To
and
fro
he
walked,
while
the
flakes
fell
faster;
and
the
wind,
which
at
first
had
but
moaned,
pitifully
howled.
"She
is
long
in
coming,"
he
muttered,
as
he
glanced
along
the
narrow
track.
"I
wonder,"
he
subjoined,
"what
I
wish
to
see
her
so
much
for?
She
is
not
coming
for
me.
But
I
have
power
over
her,
and
I
want
her
to
come
that
I
may
use
that
power."
He
continued
his
walk.
"Now,"
he
resumed,
when
a
further
period
had
elapsed,
"if
she
fails
to
come,
I
shall
hate
and
scorn
her."
It
struck
four.
He
heard
the
church
clock
far
away.
A
step
so
quick,
so
light,
that,
but
for
the
rustling
of
leaves,
it
would
scarcely
have
sounded
on
the
wood
walk,
checked
his
impatience.
The
wind
blew
fiercely
now,
and
the
thickening
white
storm
waxed
bewildering;
but
on
she
came,
and
not
dismayed.
"Well,
Martin,"
she
said
eagerly,
"how
is
he?"
"It
is
queer
how
she
thinks
of
him,"
reflected
Martin.
"The
blinding
snow
and
bitter
cold
are
nothing
to
her,
I
believe;
yet
she
is
but
a
'chitty
faced
creature,'
as
my
mother
would
say.
I
could
find
in
my
heart
to
wish
I
had
a
cloak
to
wrap
her
in."
Thus
meditating
to
himself,
he
neglected
to
answer
Miss
Helstone.
"You
have
seen
him?"
"No."
"Oh!
you
promised
you
would."
"I
mean
to
do
better
by
you
than
that.
Didn't
I
say
I
don't
care
to
see
him?"
"But
now
it
will
be
so
long
before
I
get
to
know
any
thing
certain
about
him,
and
I
am
sick
of
waiting.
Martin,
do
see
him,
and
give
him
Caroline
Helstone's
regards,
and
say
she
wished
to
know
how
he
was,
and
if
anything
could
be
done
for
his
comfort."
"I
won't."
"You
are
changed.
You
were
so
friendly
last
night."
"Come,
we
must
not
stand
in
this
wood;
it
is
too
cold."
"But
before
I
go
promise
me
to
come
again
to
morrow
with
news."
"No
such
thing.
I
am
much
too
delicate
to
make
and
keep
such
appointments
in
the
winter
season.
If
you
knew
what
a
pain
I
had
in
my
chest
this
morning,
and
how
I
went
without
breakfast,
and
was
knocked
down
besides,
you'd
feel
the
impropriety
of
bringing
me
here
in
the
snow.
Come,
I
say."
"Are
you
really
delicate,
Martin?"
"Don't
I
look
so?"
"You
have
rosy
cheeks."
"That's
hectic.
Will
you
come
or
you
won't?"
"Where?"
"With
me.
I
was
a
fool
not
to
bring
a
cloak.
I
would
have
made
you
cosy."
"You
are
going
home;
my
nearest
road
lies
