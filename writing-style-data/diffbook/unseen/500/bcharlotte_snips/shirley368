within
a
room.
Two
persons
standing
there
might
interchange
a
dialogue,
and,
so
it
were
neither
long
nor
loud,
none
be
the
wiser.
Sir
Philip
induced
two
of
his
sisters
to
perpetrate
a
duet.
He
gave
occupation
to
the
Misses
Sympson.
The
elder
ladies
were
conversing
together.
He
was
pleased
to
remark
that
meantime
Shirley
rose
to
look
at
the
pictures.
He
had
a
tale
to
tell
about
one
ancestress,
whose
dark
beauty
seemed
as
that
of
a
flower
of
the
south.
He
joined
her,
and
began
to
tell
it.
There
were
mementoes
of
the
same
lady
in
the
cabinet
adorning
the
recess;
and
while
Shirley
was
stooping
to
examine
the
missal
and
the
rosary
on
the
inlaid
shelf,
and
while
the
Misses
Nunnely
indulged
in
a
prolonged
screech,
guiltless
of
expression,
pure
of
originality,
perfectly
conventional
and
absolutely
unmeaning,
Sir
Philip
stooped
too,
and
whispered
a
few
hurried
sentences.
At
first
Miss
Keeldar
was
struck
so
still
you
might
have
fancied
that
whisper
a
charm
which
had
changed
her
to
a
statue;
but
she
presently
looked
up
and
answered.
They
parted.
Miss
Keeldar
returned
to
the
fire,
and
resumed
her
seat.
The
baronet
gazed
after
her,
then
went
and
stood
behind
his
sisters.
Mr.
Sympson
Mr.
Sympson
only
had
marked
the
pantomime.
That
gentleman
drew
his
own
conclusions.
Had
he
been
as
acute
as
he
was
meddling,
as
profound
as
he
was
prying,
he
might
have
found
that
in
Sir
Philip's
face
whereby
to
correct
his
inference.
Ever
shallow,
hasty,
and
positive,
he
went
home
quite
cock
a
hoop.
He
was
not
a
man
that
kept
secrets
well.
When
elate
on
a
subject,
he
could
not
avoid
talking
about
it.
The
next
morning,
having
occasion
to
employ
his
son's
tutor
as
his
secretary,
he
must
needs
announce
to
him,
in
mouthing
accents,
and
with
much
flimsy
pomp
of
manner,
that
he
had
better
hold
himself
prepared
for
a
return
to
the
south
at
an
early
day,
as
the
important
business
which
had
detained
him
(Mr.
Sympson)
so
long
in
Yorkshire
was
now
on
the
eve
of
fortunate
completion.
His
anxious
and
laborious
efforts
were
likely,
at
last,
to
be
crowned
with
the
happiest
success.
A
truly
eligible
addition
was
about
to
be
made
to
the
family
connections.
"In
Sir
Philip
Nunnely?"
Louis
Moore
conjectured.
Whereupon
Mr.
Sympson
treated
himself
simultaneously
to
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
a
chuckling
laugh,
checked
only
by
a
sudden
choke
of
dignity,
and
an
order
to
the
tutor
to
proceed
with
business.
For
a
day
or
two
Mr.
Sympson
continued
as
bland
as
oil,
but
also
he
seemed
to
sit
on
pins,
and
his
gait,
when
he
walked,
emulated
that
of
a
hen
treading
a
hot
girdle.
He
was
for
ever
looking
out
of
the
window
and
listening
for
chariot
wheels.
Bluebeard's
wife
Sisera's
mother
were
nothing
to
him.
He
waited
when
the
matter
should
be
opened
in
form,
when
himself
should
be
consulted,
when
lawyers
should
be
summoned,
when
settlement
discussions
and
all
