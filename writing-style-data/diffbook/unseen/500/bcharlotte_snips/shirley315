cosy
circle
now
enclosing
the
bright
little
schoolroom
fire.
She
then
took
the
post
of
toaster
general;
and
kneeling
on
the
rug,
fork
in
hand,
fulfilled
her
office
with
dexterity.
Mr.
Hall,
who
relished
any
homely
innovation
on
ordinary
usages,
and
to
whom
the
husky
oatcake
was
from
custom
suave
as
manna,
seemed
in
his
best
spirits.
He
talked
and
laughed
gleefully
now
with
Caroline,
whom
he
had
fixed
by
his
side,
now
with
Shirley,
and
again
with
Louis
Moore.
And
Louis
met
him
in
congenial
spirit.
He
did
not
laugh
much,
but
he
uttered
in
the
quietest
tone
the
wittiest
things.
Gravely
spoken
sentences,
marked
by
unexpected
turns
and
a
quite
fresh
flavour
and
poignancy,
fell
easily
from
his
lips.
He
proved
himself
to
be
what
Mr.
Hall
had
said
he
was
excellent
company.
Caroline
marvelled
at
his
humour,
but
still
more
at
his
entire
self
possession.
Nobody
there
present
seemed
to
impose
on
him
a
sensation
of
unpleasant
restraint.
Nobody
seemed
a
bore
a
check
a
chill
to
him;
and
yet
there
was
the
cool
and
lofty
Miss
Keeldar
kneeling
before
the
fire,
almost
at
his
feet.
But
Shirley
was
cool
and
lofty
no
longer,
at
least
not
at
this
moment.
She
appeared
unconscious
of
the
humility
of
her
present
position;
or
if
conscious,
it
was
only
to
taste
a
charm
in
its
lowliness.
It
did
not
revolt
her
pride
that
the
group
to
whom
she
voluntarily
officiated
as
handmaid
should
include
her
cousin's
tutor.
It
did
not
scare
her
that
while
she
handed
the
bread
and
milk
to
the
rest,
she
had
to
offer
it
to
him
also;
and
Moore
took
his
portion
from
her
hand
as
calmly
as
if
he
had
been
her
equal.
"You
are
overheated
now,"
he
said,
when
she
had
retained
the
fork
for
some
time;
"let
me
relieve
you."
And
he
took
it
from
her
with
a
sort
of
quiet
authority,
to
which
she
submitted
passively,
neither
resisting
him
nor
thanking
him.
"I
should
like
to
see
your
pictures,
Louis,"
said
Caroline,
when
the
sumptuous
luncheon
was
discussed.
"Would
not
you,
Mr.
Hall?"
"To
please
you,
I
should;
but,
for
my
own
part,
I
have
cut
him
as
an
artist.
I
had
enough
of
him
in
that
capacity
in
Cumberland
and
Westmoreland.
Many
a
wetting
we
got
amongst
the
mountains
because
he
would
persist
in
sitting
on
a
camp
stool,
catching
effects
of
rain
clouds,
gathering
mists,
fitful
sunbeams,
and
what
not."
"Here
is
the
portfolio,"
said
Henry,
bringing
it
in
one
hand
and
leaning
on
his
crutch
with
the
other.
Louis
took
it,
but
he
still
sat
as
if
he
wanted
another
to
speak.
It
seemed
as
if
he
would
not
open
it
unless
the
proud
Shirley
deigned
to
show
herself
interested
in
the
exhibition.
"He
makes
us
wait
to
whet
our
curiosity,"
she
said.
"You
understand
opening
it,"
observed
Louis,
giving
her
the
key.
"You
spoiled
the
lock
for
me
once;
try
now."
He
held
it.
She
opened
it,
and,
