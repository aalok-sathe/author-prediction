Louis,
then;
approach
him
let
him
approach.'
"'I
am
cordial,'
said
she,
hovering
aloof
like
a
white
shadow.
"'Your
voice
is
very
sweet
and
very
low,'
I
answered,
quietly
advancing.
'You
seem
subdued,
but
still
startled.'
"'No
quite
calm,
and
afraid
of
nothing,'
she
assured
me.
"'Of
nothing
but
your
votary.'
"I
bent
a
knee
to
the
flags
at
her
feet.
"'You
see
I
am
in
a
new
world,
Mr.
Moore.
I
don't
know
myself;
I
don't
know
you.
But
rise.
When
you
do
so
I
feel
troubled
and
disturbed.'
"I
obeyed.
It
would
not
have
suited
me
to
retain
that
attitude
long.
I
courted
serenity
and
confidence
for
her,
and
not
vainly.
She
trusted
and
clung
to
me
again.
"'Now,
Shirley,'
I
said,
'you
can
conceive
I
am
far
from
happy
in
my
present
uncertain,
unsettled
state.'
"'Oh
yes,
you
are
happy!'
she
cried
hastily.
'You
don't
know
how
happy
you
are.
Any
change
will
be
for
the
worse.'
"'Happy
or
not,
I
cannot
bear
to
go
on
so
much
longer.
You
are
too
generous
to
require
it.'
"'Be
reasonable,
Louis;
be
patient!
I
like
you
because
you
are
patient.'
"'Like
me
no
longer,
then;
love
me
instead.
Fix
our
marriage
day;
think
of
it
to
night,
and
decide.'
"She
breathed
a
murmur,
inarticulate
yet
expressive;
darted,
or
melted,
from
my
arms
and
I
lost
her."
Yes,
reader,
we
must
settle
accounts
now.
I
have
only
briefly
to
narrate
the
final
fates
of
some
of
the
personages
whose
acquaintance
we
have
made
in
this
narrative,
and
then
you
and
I
must
shake
hands,
and
for
the
present
separate.
Let
us
turn
to
the
curates
to
the
much
loved,
though
long
neglected.
Come
forward,
modest
merit!
Malone,
I
see,
promptly
answers
the
invocation.
He
knows
his
own
description
when
he
hears
it.
No,
Peter
Augustus;
we
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
you.
It
won't
do.
Impossible
to
trust
ourselves
with
the
touching
tale
of
your
deeds
and
destinies.
Are
you
not
aware,
Peter,
that
a
discriminating
public
has
its
crotchets;
that
the
unvarnished
truth
does
not
answer;
that
plain
facts
will
not
digest?
Do
you
not
know
that
the
squeak
of
the
real
pig
is
no
more
relished
now
than
it
was
in
days
of
yore?
Were
I
to
give
the
catastrophe
of
your
life
and
conversation,
the
public
would
sweep
off
in
shrieking
hysterics,
and
there
would
be
a
wild
cry
for
sal
volatile
and
burnt
feathers.
"Impossible!"
would
be
pronounced
here;
"untrue!"
would
be
responded
there;
"inartistic!"
would
be
solemnly
decided.
Note
well.
Whenever
you
present
the
actual,
simple
truth,
it
is,
somehow,
always
denounced
as
a
lie
they
disown
it,
cast
it
off,
throw
it
on
the
parish;
whereas
the
product
of
your
own
imagination,
the
mere
figment,
the
sheer
fiction,
is
adopted,
petted,
termed
pretty,
proper,
sweetly
natural
the
little,
spurious
wretch
gets
all
the
comfits,
the
honest,
lawful
bantling
all
the
cuffs.
Such
is
the
way
of
the
world,
Peter;
and
as
you
are
