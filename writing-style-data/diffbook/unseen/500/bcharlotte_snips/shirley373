Sympson,
assuming
vast
courage
and
consequence
on
the
strength
of
this
symptom
of
confusion.
"It
was
an
historical
picture,
uncle,
from
several
originals."
"Several
originals!
Bless
my
heart!"
"I
have
been
in
love
several
times."
"This
is
cynical."
"With
heroes
of
many
nations."
"What
next
"
"And
philosophers."
"She
is
mad
"
"Don't
ring
the
bell,
uncle;
you
will
alarm
my
aunt."
"Your
poor
dear
aunt,
what
a
niece
has
she!"
"Once
I
loved
Socrates."
"Pooh!
no
trifling,
ma'am."
"I
admired
Themistocles,
Leonidas,
Epaminondas."
"Miss
Keeldar
"
"To
pass
over
a
few
centuries,
Washington
was
a
plain
man,
but
I
liked
him;
but
to
speak
of
the
actual
present
"
"Ah!
the
actual
present."
"To
quit
crude
schoolgirl
fancies,
and
come
to
realities."
"Realities!
That
is
the
test
to
which
you
shall
be
brought,
ma'am."
"To
avow
before
what
altar
I
now
kneel
to
reveal
the
present
idol
of
my
soul
"
"You
will
make
haste
about
it,
if
you
please.
It
is
near
luncheon
time,
and
confess
you
shall."
"Confess
I
must.
My
heart
is
full
of
the
secret.
It
must
be
spoken.
I
only
wish
you
were
Mr.
Helstone
instead
of
Mr.
Sympson;
you
would
sympathize
with
me
better."
"Madam,
it
is
a
question
of
common
sense
and
common
prudence,
not
of
sympathy
and
sentiment,
and
so
on.
Did
you
say
it
was
Mr.
Helstone?"
"Not
precisely,
but
as
near
as
may
be;
they
are
rather
alike."
"I
will
know
the
name;
I
will
have
particulars."
"They
positively
are
rather
alike.
Their
very
faces
are
not
dissimilar
a
pair
of
human
falcons
and
dry,
direct,
decided
both.
But
my
hero
is
the
mightier
of
the
two.
His
mind
has
the
clearness
of
the
deep
sea,
the
patience
of
its
rocks,
the
force
of
its
billows."
"Rant
and
fustian!"
"I
dare
say
he
can
be
harsh
as
a
saw
edge
and
gruff
as
a
hungry
raven."
"Miss
Keeldar,
does
the
person
reside
in
Briarfield?
Answer
me
that."
"Uncle,
I
am
going
to
tell
you;
his
name
is
trembling
on
my
tongue."
"Speak,
girl!"
"That
was
well
said,
uncle.
'Speak,
girl!'
It
is
quite
tragic.
England
has
howled
savagely
against
this
man,
uncle,
and
she
will
one
day
roar
exultingly
over
him.
He
has
been
unscared
by
the
howl,
and
he
will
be
unelated
by
the
shout."
"I
said
she
was
mad.
She
is."
"This
country
will
change
and
change
again
in
her
demeanour
to
him;
he
will
never
change
in
his
duty
to
her.
Come,
cease
to
chafe,
uncle,
I'll
tell
you
his
name."
"You
shall
tell
me,
or
"
"Listen!
Arthur
Wellesley,
Lord
Wellington."
Mr.
Sympson
rose
up
furious.
He
bounced
out
of
the
room,
but
immediately
bounced
back
again,
shut
the
door,
and
resumed
his
seat.
"Ma'am,
you
shall
tell
me
this.
Will
your
principles
permit
you
to
marry
a
man
without
money
a
man
below
you?"
"Never
a
man
below
me."
(In
a
high
voice.)
"Will
you,
Miss
Keeldar,
marry
a
poor
man?"
"What
right
have
