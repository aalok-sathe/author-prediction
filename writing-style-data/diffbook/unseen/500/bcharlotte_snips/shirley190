laugh
unseen;
it
turned
Caroline's
head
aside,
that
her
long
curls
might
screen
the
smile
mantling
on
her
features.
Miss
Helstone,
indeed,
was
amused
by
more
than
one
point
in
Peter's
demeanour.
She
was
edified
at
the
complete
though
abrupt
diversion
of
his
homage
from
herself
to
the
heiress.
The
5,000
he
supposed
her
likely
one
day
to
inherit
were
not
to
be
weighed
in
the
balance
against
Miss
Keeldar's
estate
and
hall.
He
took
no
pains
to
conceal
his
calculations
and
tactics.
He
pretended
to
no
gradual
change
of
views;
he
wheeled
about
at
once.
The
pursuit
of
the
lesser
fortune
was
openly
relinquished
for
that
of
the
greater.
On
what
grounds
he
expected
to
succeed
in
his
chase
himself
best
knew;
certainly
not
by
skilful
management.
From
the
length
of
time
that
elapsed,
it
appeared
that
John
had
some
difficulty
in
persuading
Mr.
Donne
to
descend.
At
length,
however,
that
gentleman
appeared;
nor,
as
he
presented
himself
at
the
oak
parlour
door,
did
he
seem
in
the
slightest
degree
ashamed
or
confused
not
a
whit.
Donne,
indeed,
was
of
that
coldly
phlegmatic,
immovably
complacent,
densely
self
satisfied
nature
which
is
insensible
to
shame.
He
had
never
blushed
in
his
life;
no
humiliation
could
abash
him;
his
nerves
were
not
capable
of
sensation
enough
to
stir
his
life
and
make
colour
mount
to
his
cheek;
he
had
no
fire
in
his
blood
and
no
modesty
in
his
soul;
he
was
a
frontless,
arrogant,
decorous
slip
of
the
commonplace
conceited,
inane,
insipid;
and
this
gentleman
had
a
notion
of
wooing
Miss
Keeldar!
He
knew
no
more,
however,
how
to
set
about
the
business
than
if
he
had
been
an
image
carved
in
wood.
He
had
no
idea
of
a
taste
to
be
pleased,
a
heart
to
be
reached
in
courtship.
His
notion
was,
when
he
should
have
formally
visited
her
a
few
times,
to
write
a
letter
proposing
marriage.
Then
he
calculated
she
would
accept
him
for
love
of
his
office;
then
they
would
be
married;
then
he
should
be
master
of
Fieldhead;
and
he
should
live
very
comfortably,
have
servants
at
his
command,
eat
and
drink
of
the
best,
and
be
a
great
man.
You
would
not
have
suspected
his
intentions
when
he
addressed
his
intended
bride
in
an
impertinent,
injured
tone
"A
very
dangerous
dog
that,
Miss
Keeldar.
I
wonder
you
should
keep
such
an
animal."
"Do
you,
Mr.
Donne?
Perhaps
you
will
wonder
more
when
I
tell
you
I
am
very
fond
of
him."
"I
should
say
you
are
not
serious
in
the
assertion.
Can't
fancy
a
lady
fond
of
that
brute
'tis
so
ugly
a
mere
carter's
dog.
Pray
hang
him."
"Hang
what
I
am
fond
of!"
"And
purchase
in
his
stead
some
sweetly
pooty
pug
or
poodle
something
appropriate
to
the
fair
sex.
Ladies
generally
like
lap
dogs."
"Perhaps
I
am
an
exception."
"Oh,
you
can't
be,
you
know.
All
ladies
are
alike
in
those
matters.
That
is
universally
allowed."
"Tartar
frightened
you
terribly,
Mr.
