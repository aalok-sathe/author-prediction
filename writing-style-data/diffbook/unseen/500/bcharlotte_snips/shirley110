certain
vain
little
lad
at
our
school,
who
always
thinks
proper
to
blush
when
he
gets
a
rise
in
the
class.
For
your
benefit,
Mr.
Moore,
I've
been
looking
up
the
word
'sentimental'
in
the
dictionary,
and
I
find
it
to
mean
'tinctured
with
sentiment.'
On
examining
further,
'sentiment'
is
explained
to
be
thought,
idea,
notion.
A
sentimental
man,
then,
is
one
who
has
thoughts,
ideas,
notions;
an
unsentimental
man
is
one
destitute
of
thought,
idea,
or
notion."
And
Mark
stopped.
He
did
not
smile,
he
did
not
look
round
for
admiration.
He
had
said
his
say,
and
was
silent.
"Ma
foi!
mon
ami,"
observed
Mr.
Moore
to
Yorke,
"ce
sont
vraiment
des
enfants
terribles,
que
les
votres!"
Rose,
who
had
been
listening
attentively
to
Mark's
speech,
replied
to
him,
"There
are
different
kinds
of
thoughts,
ideas,
and
notions,"
said
she,
"good
and
bad.
Sentimental
must
refer
to
the
bad,
or
Miss
Helstone
must
have
taken
it
in
that
sense,
for
she
was
not
blaming
Mr.
Moore;
she
was
defending
him."
"That's
my
kind
little
advocate!"
said
Moore,
taking
Rose's
hand.
"She
was
defending
him,"
repeated
Rose,
"as
I
should
have
done
had
I
been
in
her
place,
for
the
other
ladies
seemed
to
speak
spitefully."
"Ladies
always
do
speak
spitefully,"
observed
Martin.
"It
is
the
nature
of
womenites
to
be
spiteful."
Matthew
now,
for
the
first
time,
opened
his
lips.
"What
a
fool
Martin
is,
to
be
always
gabbling
about
what
he
does
not
understand!"
"It
is
my
privilege,
as
a
freeman,
to
gabble
on
whatever
subject
I
like,"
responded
Martin.
"You
use
it,
or
rather
abuse
it,
to
such
an
extent,"
rejoined
the
elder
brother,
"that
you
prove
you
ought
to
have
been
a
slave."
"A
slave!
a
slave!
That
to
a
Yorke,
and
from
a
Yorke!
This
fellow,"
he
added,
standing
up
at
the
table,
and
pointing
across
it
to
Matthew
"this
fellow
forgets,
what
every
cottier
in
Briarfield
knows,
that
all
born
of
our
house
have
that
arched
instep
under
which
water
can
flow
proof
that
there
has
not
been
a
slave
of
the
blood
for
three
hundred
years."
"Mountebank!"
said
Matthew.
"Lads,
be
silent!"
exclaimed
Mr.
Yorke.
"Martin,
you
are
a
mischief
maker.
There
would
have
been
no
disturbance
but
for
you."
"Indeed!
Is
that
correct?
Did
I
begin,
or
did
Matthew?
Had
I
spoken
to
him
when
he
accused
me
of
gabbling
like
a
fool?"
"A
presumptuous
fool!"
repeated
Matthew.
Here
Mrs.
Yorke
commenced
rocking
herself
rather
a
portentous
movement
with
her,
as
it
was
occasionally
followed,
especially
when
Matthew
was
worsted
in
a
conflict,
by
a
fit
of
hysterics.
"I
don't
see
why
I
should
bear
insolence
from
Matthew
Yorke,
or
what
right
he
has
to
use
bad
language
to
me,"
observed
Martin.
"He
has
no
right,
my
lad;
but
forgive
your
brother
until
seventy
and
seven
times,"
said
Mr.
Yorke
soothingly.
"Always
alike,
and
theory
and
practice
always
adverse!"
murmured
Martin
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
room.
"Where
art
thou
going,
