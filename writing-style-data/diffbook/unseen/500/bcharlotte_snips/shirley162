of
emotion
was
rare
and
quickly
effaced.
The
sharp
pang
passed;
the
dimness
cleared
from
her
vision.
She
would
re
thread
her
needle,
rearrange
tuck
and
trimming,
and
work
on.
Late
in
the
afternoon
she
dressed
herself.
She
reached
Fieldhead,
and
appeared
in
the
oak
parlour
just
as
tea
was
brought
in.
Shirley
asked
her
why
she
came
so
late.
"Because
I
have
been
making
my
dress,"
said
she.
"These
fine
sunny
days
began
to
make
me
ashamed
of
my
winter
merino,
so
I
have
furbished
up
a
lighter
garment."
"In
which
you
look
as
I
like
to
see
you,"
said
Shirley.
"You
are
a
lady
like
little
person,
Caroline.
Is
she
not,
Mrs.
Pryor?"
Mrs.
Pryor
never
paid
compliments,
and
seldom
indulged
in
remarks,
favourable
or
otherwise,
on
personal
appearance.
On
the
present
occasion
she
only
swept
Caroline's
curls
from
her
cheek
as
she
took
a
seat
near
her,
caressed
the
oval
outline,
and
observed,
"You
get
somewhat
thin,
my
love,
and
somewhat
pale.
Do
you
sleep
well?
your
eyes
have
a
languid
look."
And
she
gazed
at
her
anxiously.
"I
sometimes
dream
melancholy
dreams,"
answered
Caroline;
"and
if
I
lie
awake
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
night,
I
am
continually
thinking
of
the
rectory
as
a
dreary
old
place.
You
know
it
is
very
near
the
churchyard.
The
back
part
of
the
house
is
extremely
ancient,
and
it
is
said
that
the
out
kitchens
there
were
once
enclosed
in
the
churchyard,
and
that
there
are
graves
under
them.
I
rather
long
to
leave
the
rectory."
"My
dear,
you
are
surely
not
superstitious?"
"No,
Mrs.
Pryor;
but
I
think
I
grow
what
is
called
nervous.
I
see
things
under
a
darker
aspect
than
I
used
to
do.
I
have
fears
I
never
used
to
have
not
of
ghosts,
but
of
omens
and
disastrous
events;
and
I
have
an
inexpressible
weight
on
my
mind
which
I
would
give
the
world
to
shake
off,
and
I
cannot
do
it."
"Strange!"
cried
Shirley.
"I
never
feel
so."
Mrs.
Pryor
said
nothing.
"Fine
weather,
pleasant
days,
pleasant
scenes,
are
powerless
to
give
me
pleasure,"
continued
Caroline.
"Calm
evenings
are
not
calm
to
me.
Moonlight,
which
I
used
to
think
mild,
now
only
looks
mournful.
Is
this
weakness
of
mind,
Mrs.
Pryor,
or
what
is
it?
I
cannot
help
it.
I
often
struggle
against
it.
I
reason;
but
reason
and
effort
make
no
difference."
"You
should
take
more
exercise,"
said
Mrs.
Pryor.
"Exercise!
I
exercise
sufficiently.
I
exercise
till
I
am
ready
to
drop."
"My
dear,
you
should
go
from
home."
"Mrs.
Pryor,
I
should
like
to
go
from
home,
but
not
on
any
purposeless
excursion
or
visit.
I
wish
to
be
a
governess,
as
you
have
been.
It
would
oblige
me
greatly
if
you
would
speak
to
my
uncle
on
the
subject."
"Nonsense!"
broke
in
Shirley.
"What
an
idea!
Be
a
governess!
Better
be
a
slave
at
once.
Where
is
the
necessity
of
it?
Why
should
you
dream
of
such
a
