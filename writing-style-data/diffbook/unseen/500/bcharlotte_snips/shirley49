a
deep
sigh.
With
this
ejaculation,
indicative
that
she
perceived
a
screw
to
be
loose
somewhere,
but
that
it
was
out
of
her
reach
to
set
it
right,
she
bent
over
her
grammar,
and
sought
the
rule
and
exercise
for
the
day.
"I
suppose
I
am
not
an
affectionate
man,
Caroline.
The
attachment
of
a
very
few
suffices
me."
"If
you
please,
Robert,
will
you
mend
me
a
pen
or
two
before
you
go?"
"First
let
me
rule
your
book,
for
you
always
contrive
to
draw
the
lines
aslant.
There
now.
And
now
for
the
pens.
You
like
a
fine
one,
I
think?"
"Such
as
you
generally
make
for
me
and
Hortense;
not
your
own
broad
points."
"If
I
were
of
Louis's
calling
I
might
stay
at
home
and
dedicate
this
morning
to
you
and
your
studies,
whereas
I
must
spend
it
in
Skyes's
wool
warehouse."
"You
will
be
making
money."
"More
likely
losing
it."
As
he
finished
mending
the
pens,
a
horse,
saddled
and
bridled,
was
brought
up
to
the
garden
gate.
"There,
Fred
is
ready
for
me;
I
must
go.
I'll
take
one
look
to
see
what
the
spring
has
done
in
the
south
border,
too,
first."
He
quitted
the
room,
and
went
out
into
the
garden
ground
behind
the
mill.
A
sweet
fringe
of
young
verdure
and
opening
flowers
snowdrop,
crocus,
even
primrose
bloomed
in
the
sunshine
under
the
hot
wall
of
the
factory
Moore
plucked
here
and
there
a
blossom
and
leaf,
till
he
had
collected
a
little
bouquet.
He
returned
to
the
parlour,
pilfered
a
thread
of
silk
from
his
sister's
work
basket,
tied
the
flowers,
and
laid
them
on
Caroline's
desk.
"Now,
good
morning."
"Thank
you,
Robert.
It
is
pretty;
it
looks,
as
it
lies
there,
like
sparkles
of
sunshine
and
blue
sky.
Good
morning."
He
went
to
the
door,
stopped,
opened
his
lips
as
if
to
speak,
said
nothing,
and
moved
on.
He
passed
through
the
wicket,
and
mounted
his
horse.
In
a
second
he
had
flung
himself
from
his
saddle
again,
transferred
the
reins
to
Murgatroyd,
and
re
entered
the
cottage.
"I
forgot
my
gloves,"
he
said,
appearing
to
take
something
from
the
side
table;
then,
as
an
impromptu
thought,
he
remarked,
"You
have
no
binding
engagement
at
home
perhaps,
Caroline?"
"I
never
have.
Some
children's
socks,
which
Mrs.
Ramsden
has
ordered,
to
knit
for
the
Jew's
basket;
but
they
will
keep."
"Jew's
basket
be
sold!
Never
was
utensil
better
named.
Anything
more
Jewish
than
it
its
contents
and
their
prices
cannot
be
conceived.
But
I
see
something,
a
very
tiny
curl,
at
the
corners
of
your
lip,
which
tells
me
that
you
know
its
merits
as
well
as
I
do.
Forget
the
Jew's
basket,
then,
and
spend
the
day
here
as
a
change.
Your
uncle
won't
break
his
heart
at
your
absence?"
She
smiled.
"No."
"The
old
Cossack!
I
dare
say
not,"
muttered
Moore.
"Then
stay
and
dine
with
Hortense;
she
will
be
glad
of
your
company.
I
shall
return
in
