not
bear
it,
and
his
children
after
him
never
could.
The
want
of
general
benevolence
made
him
very
impatient
of
imbecility,
and
of
all
faults
which
grated
on
his
strong,
shrewd
nature;
it
left
no
check
to
his
cutting
sarcasm.
As
he
was
not
merciful,
he
would
sometimes
wound
and
wound
again,
without
noticing
how
much
he
hurt,
or
caring
how
deep
he
thrust.
As
to
the
paucity
of
ideality
in
his
mind,
that
can
scarcely
be
called
a
fault:
a
fine
ear
for
music,
a
correct
eye
for
colour
and
form,
left
him
the
quality
of
taste;
and
who
cares
for
imagination?
Who
does
not
think
it
a
rather
dangerous,
senseless
attribute,
akin
to
weakness,
perhaps
partaking
of
frenzy
a
disease
rather
than
a
gift
of
the
mind?
Probably
all
think
it
so
but
those
who
possess,
or
fancy
they
possess,
it.
To
hear
them
speak,
you
would
believe
that
their
hearts
would
be
cold
if
that
elixir
did
not
flow
about
them,
that
their
eyes
would
be
dim
if
that
flame
did
not
refine
their
vision,
that
they
would
be
lonely
if
this
strange
companion
abandoned
them.
You
would
suppose
that
it
imparted
some
glad
hope
to
spring,
some
fine
charm
to
summer,
some
tranquil
joy
to
autumn,
some
consolation
to
winter,
which
you
do
not
feel.
An
illusion,
of
course;
but
the
fanatics
cling
to
their
dream,
and
would
not
give
it
for
gold.
As
Mr.
Yorke
did
not
possess
poetic
imagination
himself,
he
considered
it
a
most
superfluous
quality
in
others.
Painters
and
musicians
he
could
tolerate,
and
even
encourage,
because
he
could
relish
the
results
of
their
art;
he
could
see
the
charm
of
a
fine
picture,
and
feel
the
pleasure
of
good
music;
but
a
quiet
poet
whatever
force
struggled,
whatever
fire
glowed,
in
his
breast
if
he
could
not
have
played
the
man
in
the
counting
house,
of
the
tradesman
in
the
Piece
Hall,
might
have
lived
despised,
and
died
scorned,
under
the
eyes
of
Hiram
Yorke.
And
as
there
are
many
Hiram
Yorkes
in
the
world,
it
is
well
that
the
true
poet,
quiet
externally
though
he
may
be,
has
often
a
truculent
spirit
under
his
placidity,
and
is
full
of
shrewdness
in
his
meekness,
and
can
measure
the
whole
stature
of
those
who
look
down
on
him,
and
correctly
ascertain
the
weight
and
value
of
the
pursuits
they
disdain
him
for
not
having
followed.
It
is
happy
that
he
can
have
his
own
bliss,
his
own
society
with
his
great
friend
and
goddess
Nature,
quite
independent
of
those
who
find
little
pleasure
in
him,
and
in
whom
he
finds
no
pleasure
at
all.
It
is
just
that
while
the
world
and
circumstances
often
turn
a
dark,
cold
side
to
him
and
properly,
too,
because
he
first
turns
a
dark,
cold,
careless
side
to
them
he
should
be
able
to
maintain
a
festal
brightness
and
cherishing
glow
in
his
bosom,
which
makes
all
bright
and
genial
for
him;
while
strangers,
perhaps,
deem
