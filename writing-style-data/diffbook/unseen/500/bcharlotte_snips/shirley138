more.
She
had
now
placed
her
flowers
on
the
table,
and
was
busied
in
arranging
them.
"And
St.
Athanasius's
Creed?"
urged
the
rector.
"You
believe
it
all,
don't
you?"
"I
can't
remember
it
quite
all.
I
will
give
you
a
nosegay,
Mr.
Helstone,
when
I
have
given
your
niece
one."
She
had
selected
a
little
bouquet
of
one
brilliant
and
two
or
three
delicate
flowers,
relieved
by
a
spray
of
dark
verdure.
She
tied
it
with
silk
from
her
work
box,
and
placed
it
on
Caroline's
lap;
and
then
she
put
her
hands
behind
her,
and
stood
bending
slightly
towards
her
guest,
still
regarding
her,
in
the
attitude
and
with
something
of
the
aspect
of
a
grave
but
gallant
little
cavalier.
This
temporary
expression
of
face
was
aided
by
the
style
in
which
she
wore
her
hair,
parted
on
one
temple,
and
brushed
in
a
glossy
sweep
above
the
forehead,
whence
it
fell
in
curls
that
looked
natural,
so
free
were
their
wavy
undulations.
"Are
you
tired
with
your
walk?"
she
inquired.
"No
not
in
the
least.
It
is
but
a
short
distance
but
a
mile."
"You
look
pale.
Is
she
always
so
pale?"
she
asked,
turning
to
the
rector.
"She
used
to
be
as
rosy
as
the
reddest
of
your
flowers."
"Why
is
she
altered?
What
has
made
her
pale?
Has
she
been
ill?"
"She
tells
me
she
wants
a
change."
"She
ought
to
have
one.
You
ought
to
give
her
one.
You
should
send
her
to
the
sea
coast."
"I
will,
ere
summer
is
over.
Meantime,
I
intend
her
to
make
acquaintance
with
you,
if
you
have
no
objection."
"I
am
sure
Miss
Keeldar
will
have
no
objection,"
here
observed
Mrs.
Pryor.
"I
think
I
may
take
it
upon
me
to
say
that
Miss
Helstone's
frequent
presence
at
Fieldhead
will
be
esteemed
a
favour."
"You
speak
my
sentiments
precisely,
ma'am,"
said
Shirley,
"and
I
thank
you
for
anticipating
me.
Let
me
tell
you,"
she
continued,
turning
again
to
Caroline,
"that
you
also
ought
to
thank
my
governess.
It
is
not
every
one
she
would
welcome
as
she
has
welcomed
you.
You
are
distinguished
more
than
you
think.
This
morning,
as
soon
as
you
are
gone,
I
shall
ask
Mrs.
Pryor's
opinion
of
you.
I
am
apt
to
rely
on
her
judgment
of
character,
for
hitherto
I
have
found
it
wondrous
accurate.
Already
I
foresee
a
favourable
answer
to
my
inquiries.
Do
I
not
guess
rightly,
Mrs.
Pryor?"
"My
dear,
you
said
but
now
you
would
ask
my
opinion
when
Miss
Helstone
was
gone.
I
am
scarcely
likely
to
give
it
in
her
presence."
"No;
and
perhaps
it
will
be
long
enough
before
I
obtain
it.
I
am
sometimes
sadly
tantalized,
Mr.
Helstone,
by
Mrs.
Pryor's
extreme
caution.
Her
judgments
ought
to
be
correct
when
they
come,
for
they
are
often
as
tardy
of
delivery
as
a
Lord
Chancellor's.
On
some
people's
characters
I
cannot
get
her
to
pronounce
a
sentence,
entreat
as
I
may."
Mrs.
Pryor
here
smiled.
