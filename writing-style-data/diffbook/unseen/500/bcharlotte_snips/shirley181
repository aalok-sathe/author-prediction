your
only
notion
of
charity
is
to
give
shillings
and
half
crowns
in
a
careless,
free
handed
sort
of
way,
which
is
liable
to
continual
abuse.
You
must
have
a
prime
minister,
or
you
will
get
yourself
into
a
series
of
scrapes.
You
suggested
Miss
Ainley
yourself;
to
Miss
Ainley
I
will
apply.
And,
meantime,
promise
to
keep
quiet,
and
not
begin
throwing
away
your
money.
What
a
great
deal
you
have,
Shirley!
You
must
feel
very
rich
with
all
that?"
"Yes;
I
feel
of
consequence.
It
is
not
an
immense
sum,
but
I
feel
responsible
for
its
disposal;
and
really
this
responsibility
weighs
on
my
mind
more
heavily
than
I
could
have
expected.
They
say
that
there
are
some
families
almost
starving
to
death
in
Briarfield.
Some
of
my
own
cottagers
are
in
wretched
circumstances.
I
must
and
will
help
them."
"Some
people
say
we
shouldn't
give
alms
to
the
poor,
Shirley."
"They
are
great
fools
for
their
pains.
For
those
who
are
not
hungry,
it
is
easy
to
palaver
about
the
degradation
of
charity,
and
so
on:
but
they
forget
the
brevity
of
life,
as
well
as
its
bitterness.
We
have
none
of
us
long
to
live.
Let
us
help
each
other
through
seasons
of
want
and
woe
as
well
as
we
can,
without
heeding
in
the
least
the
scruples
of
vain
philosophy."
"But
you
do
help
others,
Shirley.
You
give
a
great
deal
as
it
is."
"Not
enough.
I
must
give
more,
or,
I
tell
you,
my
brother's
blood
will
some
day
be
crying
to
Heaven
against
me.
For,
after
all,
if
political
incendiaries
come
here
to
kindle
conflagration
in
the
neighbourhood,
and
my
property
is
attacked,
I
shall
defend
it
like
a
tigress
I
know
I
shall.
Let
me
listen
to
Mercy
as
long
as
she
is
near
me.
Her
voice
once
drowned
by
the
shout
of
ruffian
defiance,
and
I
shall
be
full
of
impulses
to
resist
and
quell.
If
once
the
poor
gather
and
rise
in
the
form
of
the
mob,
I
shall
turn
against
them
as
an
aristocrat;
if
they
bully
me,
I
must
defy:
if
they
attack,
I
must
resist,
and
I
will."
"You
talk
like
Robert."
"I
feel
like
Robert,
only
more
fierily.
Let
them
meddle
with
Robert,
or
Robert's
mill,
or
Robert's
interests,
and
I
shall
hate
them.
At
present
I
am
no
patrician,
nor
do
I
regard
the
poor
around
me
as
plebeians;
but
if
once
they
violently
wrong
me
or
mine,
and
then
presume
to
dictate
to
us,
I
shall
quite
forget
pity
for
their
wretchedness
and
respect
for
their
poverty,
in
scorn
of
their
ignorance
and
wrath
at
their
insolence."
"Shirley,
how
your
eyes
flash!"
"Because
my
soul
burns.
Would
you,
any
more
than
me,
let
Robert
be
borne
down
by
numbers?"
"If
I
had
your
power
to
aid
Robert,
I
would
use
it
as
you
mean
to
use
it.
If
I
could
be
such
a
friend
to
him
as
you
can
be,
I
would
stand
by
