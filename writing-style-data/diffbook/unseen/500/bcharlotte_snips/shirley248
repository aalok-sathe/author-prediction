and
candid
enough,
is
still
perfectly
capable
of
defying
even
Mr.
Moore's
penetration."
"What
have
you
and
she
been
doing?"
asked
Moore
suddenly.
"Have
you
had
any
breakfast?"
"What
is
your
mutual
mystery?"
"If
you
are
hungry,
Mrs.
Gill
will
give
you
something
to
eat
here.
Step
into
the
oak
parlour,
and
ring
the
bell.
You
will
be
served
as
if
at
an
inn;
or,
if
you
like
better,
go
back
to
the
Hollow."
"The
alternative
is
not
open
to
me;
I
must
go
back.
Good
morning.
The
first
leisure
I
have
I
will
see
you
again."
While
Shirley
was
talking
with
Moore,
Caroline
rejoined
Mrs.
Pryor
upstairs.
She
found
that
lady
deeply
depressed.
She
would
not
say
that
Miss
Keeldar's
hastiness
had
hurt
her
feelings,
but
it
was
evident
an
inward
wound
galled
her.
To
any
but
a
congenial
nature
she
would
have
seemed
insensible
to
the
quiet,
tender
attentions
by
which
Miss
Helstone
sought
to
impart
solace;
but
Caroline
knew
that,
unmoved
or
slightly
moved
as
she
looked,
she
felt,
valued,
and
was
healed
by
them.
"I
am
deficient
in
self
confidence
and
decision,"
she
said
at
last.
"I
always
have
been
deficient
in
those
qualities.
Yet
I
think
Miss
Keeldar
should
have
known
my
character
well
enough
by
this
time
to
be
aware
that
I
always
feel
an
even
painful
solicitude
to
do
right,
to
act
for
the
best.
The
unusual
nature
of
the
demand
on
my
judgment
puzzled
me,
especially
following
the
alarms
of
the
night.
I
could
not
venture
to
act
promptly
for
another;
but
I
trust
no
serious
harm
will
result
from
my
lapse
of
firmness."
A
gentle
knock
was
here
heard
at
the
door.
It
was
half
opened.
"Caroline,
come
here,"
said
a
low
voice.
Miss
Helstone
went
out.
There
stood
Shirley
in
the
gallery,
looking
contrite,
ashamed,
sorry
as
any
repentant
child.
"How
is
Mrs.
Pryor?"
she
asked.
"Rather
out
of
spirits,"
said
Caroline.
"I
have
behaved
very
shamefully,
very
ungenerously,
very
ungratefully
to
her,"
said
Shirley.
"How
insolent
in
me
to
turn
on
her
thus
for
what,
after
all,
was
no
fault
only
an
excess
of
conscientiousness
on
her
part.
But
I
regret
my
error
most
sincerely.
Tell
her
so,
and
ask
if
she
will
forgive
me."
Caroline
discharged
the
errand
with
heartfelt
pleasure.
Mrs.
Pryor
rose,
came
to
the
door.
She
did
not
like
scenes;
she
dreaded
them
as
all
timid
people
do.
She
said
falteringly,
"Come
in,
my
dear."
Shirley
did
come
in
with
some
impetuosity.
She
threw
her
arms
round
her
governess,
and
while
she
kissed
her
heartily
she
said,
"You
know
you
must
forgive
me,
Mrs.
Pryor.
I
could
not
get
on
at
all
if
there
was
a
misunderstanding
between
you
and
me."
"I
have
nothing
to
forgive,"
was
the
reply.
"We
will
pass
it
over
now,
if
you
please.
The
final
result
of
the
incident
is
that
it
proves
more
plainly
than
ever
how
unequal
I
am
to
certain
crises."
And
that
was
the
painful
feeling
