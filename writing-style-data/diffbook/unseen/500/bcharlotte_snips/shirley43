their
decayed
family,
the
persons
of
both
were
almost
sacred
in
her
eyes.
Of
Louis,
however,
she
knew
less
than
of
Robert.
He
had
been
sent
to
England
when
a
mere
boy,
and
had
received
his
education
at
an
English
school.
His
education
not
being
such
as
to
adapt
him
for
trade,
perhaps,
too,
his
natural
bent
not
inclining
him
to
mercantile
pursuits,
he
had,
when
the
blight
of
hereditary
prospects
rendered
it
necessary
for
him
to
push
his
own
fortune,
adopted
the
very
arduous
and
very
modest
career
of
a
teacher.
He
had
been
usher
in
a
school,
and
was
said
now
to
be
tutor
in
a
private
family.
Hortense,
when
she
mentioned
Louis,
described
him
as
having
what
she
called
"des
moyens,"
but
as
being
too
backward
and
quiet.
Her
praise
of
Robert
was
in
a
different
strain,
less
qualified:
she
was
very
proud
of
him;
she
regarded
him
as
the
greatest
man
in
Europe;
all
he
said
and
did
was
remarkable
in
her
eyes,
and
she
expected
others
to
behold
him
from
the
same
point
of
view;
nothing
could
be
more
irrational,
monstrous,
and
infamous
than
opposition
from
any
quarter
to
Robert,
unless
it
were
opposition
to
herself.
Accordingly,
as
soon
as
the
said
Robert
was
seated
at
the
breakfast
table,
and
she
had
helped
him
to
a
portion
of
stewed
pears,
and
cut
him
a
good
sized
Belgian
tartine,
she
began
to
pour
out
a
flood
of
amazement
and
horror
at
the
transaction
of
last
night,
the
destruction
of
the
frames.
"Quelle
idee!
to
destroy
them.
Quelle
action
honteuse!
On
voyait
bien
que
les
ouvriers
de
ce
pays
etaient
a
la
fois
betes
et
mechants.
C'etait
absolument
comme
les
domestiques
anglais,
les
servantes
surtout:
rien
d'insupportable
comme
cette
Sara,
par
exemple!"
"She
looks
clean
and
industrious,"
Mr.
Moore
remarked.
"Looks!
I
don't
know
how
she
looks,
and
I
do
not
say
that
she
is
altogether
dirty
or
idle,
mais
elle
est
d'une
insolence!
She
disputed
with
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
yesterday
about
the
cooking
of
the
beef;
she
said
I
boiled
it
to
rags,
that
English
people
would
never
be
able
to
eat
such
a
dish
as
our
bouilli,
that
the
bouillon
was
no
better
than
greasy
warm
water,
and
as
to
the
choucroute,
she
affirms
she
cannot
touch
it!
That
barrel
we
have
in
the
cellar
delightfully
prepared
by
my
own
hands
she
termed
a
tub
of
hog
wash,
which
means
food
for
pigs.
I
am
harassed
with
the
girl,
and
yet
I
cannot
part
with
her
lest
I
should
get
a
worse.
You
are
in
the
same
position
with
your
workmen,
pauvre
cher
frere!"
"I
am
afraid
you
are
not
very
happy
in
England,
Hortense."
"It
is
my
duty
to
be
happy
where
you
are,
brother;
but
otherwise
there
are
certainly
a
thousand
things
which
make
me
regret
our
native
town.
All
the
world
here
appears
to
me
ill
bred
(mal
eleve).
I
find
my
habits
considered
ridiculous.
If
a
girl
out
