hard
driven,
she
will
rebel
one
day,
and
then
it
will
be
once
for
all.
Rose
loves
her
father:
her
father
does
not
rule
her
with
a
rod
of
iron;
he
is
good
to
her.
He
sometimes
fears
she
will
not
live,
so
bright
are
the
sparks
of
intelligence
which,
at
moments,
flash
from
her
glance
and
gleam
in
her
language.
This
idea
makes
him
often
sadly
tender
to
her.
He
has
no
idea
that
little
Jessy
will
die
young,
she
is
so
gay
and
chattering,
arch,
original
even
now;
passionate
when
provoked,
but
most
affectionate
if
caressed;
by
turns
gentle
and
rattling;
exacting,
yet
generous;
fearless
of
her
mother,
for
instance,
whose
irrationally
hard
and
strict
rule
she
has
often
defied
yet
reliant
on
any
who
will
help
her.
Jessy,
with
her
little
piquant
face,
engaging
prattle,
and
winning
ways,
is
made
to
be
a
pet,
and
her
father's
pet
she
accordingly
is.
It
is
odd
that
the
doll
should
resemble
her
mother
feature
by
feature,
as
Rose
resembles
her
father,
and
yet
the
physiognomy
how
different!
Mr.
Yorke,
if
a
magic
mirror
were
now
held
before
you,
and
if
therein
were
shown
you
your
two
daughters
as
they
will
be
twenty
years
from
this
night,
what
would
you
think?
The
magic
mirror
is
here:
you
shall
learn
their
destinies
and
first
that
of
your
little
life,
Jessy.
Do
you
know
this
place?
No,
you
never
saw
it;
but
you
recognize
the
nature
of
these
trees,
this
foliage
the
cypress,
the
willow,
the
yew.
Stone
crosses
like
these
are
not
unfamiliar
to
you,
nor
are
these
dim
garlands
of
everlasting
flowers.
Here
is
the
place
green
sod
and
a
gray
marble
headstone.
Jessy
sleeps
below.
She
lived
through
an
April
day;
much
loved
was
she,
much
loving.
She
often,
in
her
brief
life,
shed
tears,
she
had
frequent
sorrows;
she
smiled
between,
gladdening
whatever
saw
her.
Her
death
was
tranquil
and
happy
in
Rose's
guardian
arms,
for
Rose
had
been
her
stay
and
defence
through
many
trials.
The
dying
and
the
watching
English
girls
were
at
that
hour
alone
in
a
foreign
country,
and
the
soil
of
that
country
gave
Jessy
a
grave.
Now,
behold
Rose
two
years
later.
The
crosses
and
garlands
looked
strange,
but
the
hills
and
woods
of
this
landscape
look
still
stranger.
This,
indeed,
is
far
from
England;
remote
must
be
the
shores
which
wear
that
wild,
luxuriant
aspect.
This
is
some
virgin
solitude.
Unknown
birds
flutter
round
the
skirts
of
that
forest;
no
European
river
this,
on
whose
banks
Rose
sits
thinking.
The
little
quiet
Yorkshire
girl
is
a
lonely
emigrant
in
some
region
of
the
southern
hemisphere.
Will
she
ever
come
back?
The
three
eldest
of
the
family
are
all
boys
Matthew,
Mark,
and
Martin.
They
are
seated
together
in
that
corner,
engaged
in
some
game.
Observe
their
three
heads:
much
alike
at
a
first
glance;
at
a
second,
different;
at
a
third,
contrasted.
Dark
haired,
dark
eyed,
red
cheeked
are
the
whole
