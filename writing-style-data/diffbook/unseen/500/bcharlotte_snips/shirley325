as
her
light
step
traversed
the
gallery
in
the
course
of
a
day,
it
did
not
again
pause
at
his
door;
nor
did
her
"cooing,
vibrating
voice"
disturb
a
second
time
the
hush
of
the
sickroom.
A
sickroom,
indeed,
it
soon
ceased
to
be;
Mr.
Moore's
good
constitution
quickly
triumphed
over
his
indisposition.
In
a
few
days
he
shook
it
off,
and
resumed
his
duties
as
tutor.
That
"auld
lang
syne"
had
still
its
authority
both
with
preceptor
and
scholar
was
proved
by
the
manner
in
which
he
sometimes
promptly
passed
the
distance
she
usually
maintained
between
them,
and
put
down
her
high
reserve
with
a
firm,
quiet
hand.
One
afternoon
the
Sympson
family
were
gone
out
to
take
a
carriage
airing.
Shirley,
never
sorry
to
snatch
a
reprieve
from
their
society,
had
remained
behind,
detained
by
business,
as
she
said.
The
business
a
little
letter
writing
was
soon
dispatched
after
the
yard
gates
had
closed
on
the
carriage;
Miss
Keeldar
betook
herself
to
the
garden.
It
was
a
peaceful
autumn
day.
The
gilding
of
the
Indian
summer
mellowed
the
pastures
far
and
wide.
The
russet
woods
stood
ripe
to
be
stripped,
but
were
yet
full
of
leaf.
The
purple
of
heath
bloom,
faded
but
not
withered,
tinged
the
hills.
The
beck
wandered
down
to
the
Hollow,
through
a
silent
district;
no
wind
followed
its
course
or
haunted
its
woody
borders.
Fieldhead
gardens
bore
the
seal
of
gentle
decay.
On
the
walks,
swept
that
morning,
yellow
leaves
had
fluttered
down
again.
Its
time
of
flowers,
and
even
of
fruits,
was
over;
but
a
scantling
of
apples
enriched
the
trees.
Only
a
blossom
here
and
there
expanded
pale
and
delicate
amidst
a
knot
of
faded
leaves.
These
single
flowers
the
last
of
their
race
Shirley
culled
as
she
wandered
thoughtfully
amongst
the
beds.
She
was
fastening
into
her
girdle
a
hueless
and
scentless
nosegay,
when
Henry
Sympson
called
to
her
as
he
came
limping
from
the
house.
"Shirley,
Mr.
Moore
would
be
glad
to
see
you
in
the
schoolroom
and
to
hear
you
read
a
little
French,
if
you
have
no
more
urgent
occupation."
The
messenger
delivered
his
commission
very
simply,
as
if
it
were
a
mere
matter
of
course.
"Did
Mr.
Moore
tell
you
to
say
that?"
"Certainly;
why
not?
And
now,
do
come,
and
let
us
once
more
be
as
we
were
at
Sympson
Grove.
We
used
to
have
pleasant
school
hours
in
those
days."
Miss
Keeldar
perhaps
thought
that
circumstances
were
changed
since
then;
however,
she
made
no
remark,
but
after
a
little
reflection
quietly
followed
Henry.
Entering
the
schoolroom,
she
inclined
her
head
with
a
decent
obeisance,
as
had
been
her
wont
in
former
times.
She
removed
her
bonnet,
and
hung
it
up
beside
Henry's
cap.
Louis
Moore
sat
at
his
desk,
turning
the
leaves
of
a
book,
open
before
him,
and
marking
passages
with
his
pencil.
He
just
moved,
in
acknowledgment
of
her
curtsy,
but
did
not
rise.
"You
proposed
to
read
to
me
