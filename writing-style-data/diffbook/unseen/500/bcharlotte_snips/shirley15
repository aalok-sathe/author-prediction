manufacturers
seem
paralyzed
when
they
are
attacked.
Sykes,
for
instance,
when
his
dressing
shop
was
set
on
fire
and
burned
to
the
ground,
when
the
cloth
was
torn
from
his
tenters
and
left
in
shreds
in
the
field,
took
no
steps
to
discover
or
punish
the
miscreants:
he
gave
up
as
tamely
as
a
rabbit
under
the
jaws
of
a
ferret.
Now
I,
if
I
know
myself,
should
stand
by
my
trade,
my
mill,
and
my
machinery."
"Helstone
says
these
three
are
your
gods;
that
the
'Orders
in
Council'
are
with
you
another
name
for
the
seven
deadly
sins;
that
Castlereagh
is
your
Antichrist,
and
the
war
party
his
legions."
"Yes;
I
abhor
all
these
things
because
they
ruin
me.
They
stand
in
my
way.
I
cannot
get
on.
I
cannot
execute
my
plans
because
of
them.
I
see
myself
baffled
at
every
turn
by
their
untoward
effects."
"But
you
are
rich
and
thriving,
Moore?"
"I
am
very
rich
in
cloth
I
cannot
sell.
You
should
step
into
my
warehouse
yonder,
and
observe
how
it
is
piled
to
the
roof
with
pieces.
Roakes
and
Pearson
are
in
the
same
condition.
America
used
to
be
their
market,
but
the
Orders
in
Council
have
cut
that
off."
Malone
did
not
seem
prepared
to
carry
on
briskly
a
conversation
of
this
sort.
He
began
to
knock
the
heels
of
his
boots
together,
and
to
yawn.
"And
then
to
think,"
continued
Mr.
Moore
who
seemed
too
much
taken
up
with
the
current
of
his
own
thoughts
to
note
the
symptoms
of
his
guest's
ennui
"to
think
that
these
ridiculous
gossips
of
Whinbury
and
Briarfield
will
keep
pestering
one
about
being
married!
As
if
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
in
life
but
to
'pay
attention,'
as
they
say,
to
some
young
lady,
and
then
to
go
to
church
with
her,
and
then
to
start
on
a
bridal
tour,
and
then
to
run
through
a
round
of
visits,
and
then,
I
suppose,
to
be
'having
a
family.'
Oh,
que
le
diable
emporte!"
He
broke
off
the
aspiration
into
which
he
was
launching
with
a
certain
energy,
and
added,
more
calmly,
"I
believe
women
talk
and
think
only
of
these
things,
and
they
naturally
fancy
men's
minds
similarly
occupied."
"Of
course
of
course,"
assented
Malone;
"but
never
mind
them."
And
he
whistled,
looked
impatiently
round,
and
seemed
to
feel
a
great
want
of
something.
This
time
Moore
caught
and,
it
appeared,
comprehended
his
demonstrations.
"Mr.
Malone,"
said
he,
"you
must
require
refreshment
after
your
wet
walk.
I
forget
hospitality."
"Not
at
all,"
rejoined
Malone;
but
he
looked
as
if
the
right
nail
was
at
last
hit
on
the
head,
nevertheless.
Moore
rose
and
opened
a
cupboard.
"It
is
my
fancy,"
said
he,
"to
have
every
convenience
within
myself,
and
not
to
be
dependent
on
the
feminity
in
the
cottage
yonder
for
every
mouthful
I
eat
or
every
drop
I
drink.
I
often
spend
the
evening
and
sup
here
alone,
and
sleep
with
Joe
Scott
in
the
