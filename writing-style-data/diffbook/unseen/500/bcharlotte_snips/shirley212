he
should
sit.
Shirley
subsided;
her
features
altered
their
lines;
the
raised
knit
brow
and
inexplicable
curve
of
the
mouth
became
straight
again;
wilfulness
and
roguery
gave
place
to
other
expressions;
and
all
the
angular
movements
with
which
she
had
vexed
the
soul
of
Sam
Wynne
were
conjured
to
rest
as
by
a
charm.
Still
no
gracious
glance
was
cast
on
Moore.
On
the
contrary,
he
was
accused
of
giving
her
a
world
of
trouble,
and
roundly
charged
with
being
the
cause
of
depriving
her
of
the
esteem
of
Mr.
Ramsden
and
the
invaluable
friendship
of
Mr.
Samuel
Wynne.
"Wouldn't
have
offended
either
gentleman
for
the
world,"
she
averred.
"I
have
always
been
accustomed
to
treat
both
with
the
most
respectful
consideration,
and
there,
owing
to
you,
how
they
have
been
used!
I
shall
not
be
happy
till
I
have
made
it
up.
I
never
am
happy
till
I
am
friends
with
my
neighbours.
So
to
morrow
I
must
make
a
pilgrimage
to
Royd
corn
mill,
soothe
the
miller,
and
praise
the
grain;
and
next
day
I
must
call
at
De
Walden
where
I
hate
to
go
and
carry
in
my
reticule
half
an
oatcake
to
give
to
Mr.
Sam's
favourite
pointers."
"You
know
the
surest
path
to
the
heart
of
each
swain,
I
doubt
not,"
said
Moore
quietly.
He
looked
very
content
to
have
at
last
secured
his
present
place;
but
he
made
no
fine
speech
expressive
of
gratification,
and
offered
no
apology
for
the
trouble
he
had
given.
His
phlegm
became
him
wonderfully.
It
made
him
look
handsomer,
he
was
so
composed;
it
made
his
vicinage
pleasant,
it
was
so
peace
restoring.
You
would
not
have
thought,
to
look
at
him,
that
he
was
a
poor,
struggling
man
seated
beside
a
rich
woman;
the
calm
of
equality
stilled
his
aspect;
perhaps
that
calm,
too,
reigned
in
his
soul.
Now
and
then,
from
the
way
in
which
he
looked
down
on
Miss
Keeldar
as
he
addressed
her,
you
would
have
fancied
his
station
towered
above
hers
as
much
as
his
stature
did.
Almost
stern
lights
sometimes
crossed
his
brow
and
gleamed
in
his
eyes.
Their
conversation
had
become
animated,
though
it
was
confined
to
a
low
key;
she
was
urging
him
with
questions
evidently
he
refused
to
her
curiosity
all
the
gratification
it
demanded.
She
sought
his
eye
once
with
hers.
You
read,
in
its
soft
yet
eager
expression,
that
it
solicited
clearer
replies.
Moore
smiled
pleasantly,
but
his
lips
continued
sealed.
Then
she
was
piqued,
and
turned
away;
but
he
recalled
her
attention
in
two
minutes.
He
seemed
making
promises,
which
he
soothed
her
into
accepting
in
lieu
of
information.
It
appeared
that
the
heat
of
the
room
did
not
suit
Miss
Helstone.
She
grew
paler
and
paler
as
the
process
of
tea
making
was
protracted.
The
moment
thanks
were
returned
she
quitted
the
table,
and
hastened
to
follow
her
cousin
Hortense,
who,
with
Miss
Mann,
had
already
sought
the
open
air.
Robert
Moore
had
risen
when
she
