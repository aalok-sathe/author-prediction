on
any
occasion.
"Quick!
quick!
I
am
always
busy,
you
know.
I
have
no
time
to
lose."
She
hurriedly
gathered
up
her
materials,
asking,
meantime,
where
they
were
going.
"To
Fieldhead."
"Fieldhead!
What!
to
see
old
James
Booth,
the
gardener?
Is
he
ill?"
"We
are
going
to
see
Miss
Shirley
Keeldar."
"Miss
Keeldar!
Is
she
coming
to
Yorkshire?
Is
she
at
Fieldhead?"
"She
is.
She
has
been
there
a
week.
I
met
her
at
a
party
last
night
that
party
to
which
you
would
not
go.
I
was
pleased
with
her.
I
choose
that
you
shall
make
her
acquaintance.
It
will
do
you
good."
"She
is
now
come
of
age,
I
suppose?"
"She
is
come
of
age,
and
will
reside
for
a
time
on
her
property.
I
lectured
her
on
the
subject;
I
showed
her
her
duty.
She
is
not
intractable.
She
is
rather
a
fine
girl;
she
will
teach
you
what
it
is
to
have
a
sprightly
spirit.
Nothing
lackadaisical
about
her."
"I
don't
think
she
will
want
to
see
me,
or
to
have
me
introduced
to
her.
What
good
can
I
do
her?
How
can
I
amuse
her?"
"Pshaw!
Put
your
bonnet
on."
"Is
she
proud,
uncle?"
"Don't
know.
You
hardly
imagine
she
would
show
her
pride
to
me,
I
suppose?
A
chit
like
that
would
scarcely
presume
to
give
herself
airs
with
the
rector
of
her
parish,
however
rich
she
might
be."
"No.
But
how
did
she
behave
to
other
people?"
"Didn't
observe.
She
holds
her
head
high,
and
probably
can
be
saucy
enough
where
she
dare.
She
wouldn't
be
a
woman
otherwise.
There!
Away
now
for
your
bonnet
at
once!"
Not
naturally
very
confident,
a
failure
of
physical
strength
and
a
depression
of
spirits
had
not
tended
to
increase
Caroline's
presence
of
mind
and
ease
of
manner,
or
to
give
her
additional
courage
to
face
strangers,
and
she
quailed,
in
spite
of
self
remonstrance,
as
she
and
her
uncle
walked
up
the
broad,
paved
approach
leading
from
the
gateway
of
Fieldhead
to
its
porch.
She
followed
Mr.
Helstone
reluctantly
through
that
porch
into
the
sombre
old
vestibule
beyond.
Very
sombre
it
was
long,
vast,
and
dark;
one
latticed
window
lit
it
but
dimly.
The
wide
old
chimney
contained
now
no
fire,
for
the
present
warm
weather
needed
it
not;
it
was
filled
instead
with
willow
boughs.
The
gallery
on
high,
opposite
the
entrance,
was
seen
but
in
outline,
so
shadowy
became
this
hall
towards
its
ceiling.
Carved
stags'
heads,
with
real
antlers,
looked
down
grotesquely
from
the
walls.
This
was
neither
a
grand
nor
a
comfortable
house;
within
as
without
it
was
antique,
rambling,
and
incommodious.
A
property
of
a
thousand
a
year
belonged
to
it,
which
property
had
descended,
for
lack
of
male
heirs,
on
a
female.
There
were
mercantile
families
in
the
district
boasting
twice
the
income,
but
the
Keeldars,
by
virtue
of
their
antiquity,
and
their
distinction
of
lords
of
the
manor,
took
the
precedence
of
all.
Mr.
and
Miss
Helstone
were
ushered
