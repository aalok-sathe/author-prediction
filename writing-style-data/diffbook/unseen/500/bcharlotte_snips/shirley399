mewed
up,
kept
in
solitary
confinement.
They
mean
to
make
either
an
idiot
or
a
maniac
of
him,
and
take
out
a
commission
of
lunacy.
Horsfall
starves
him;
you
saw
how
thin
he
was."
"You
were
very
good
the
other
day,
Martin."
"What
day?
I
am
always
good
a
model."
"When
will
you
be
so
good
again?"
"I
see
what
you
are
after;
but
you'll
not
wheedle
me
I
am
no
cat's
paw."
"But
it
must
be
done.
It
is
quite
a
right
thing,
and
a
necessary
thing."
"How
you
encroach!
Remember,
I
managed
the
matter
of
my
own
free
will
before."
"And
you
will
again."
"I
won't.
The
business
gave
me
far
too
much
trouble.
I
like
my
ease."
"Mr.
Moore
wishes
to
see
me,
Martin,
and
I
wish
to
see
him."
"I
dare
say"
(coolly).
"It
is
too
bad
of
your
mother
to
exclude
his
friends."
"Tell
her
so."
"His
own
relations."
"Come
and
blow
her
up."
"You
know
that
would
advance
nothing.
Well,
I
shall
stick
to
my
point.
See
him
I
will.
If
you
won't
help
me,
I'll
manage
without
help."
"Do;
there
is
nothing
like
self
reliance,
self
dependence."
"I
have
no
time
to
reason
with
you
now;
but
I
consider
you
provoking.
Good
morning."
Away
she
went,
the
umbrella
shut,
for
she
could
not
carry
it
against
the
wind.
"She
is
not
vapid;
she
is
not
shallow,"
said
Martin.
"I
shall
like
to
watch,
and
mark
how
she
will
work
her
way
without
help.
If
the
storm
were
not
of
snow,
but
of
fire
such
as
came
refreshingly
down
on
the
cities
of
the
plain
she
would
go
through
it
to
procure
five
minutes'
speech
of
that
Moore.
Now,
I
consider
I
have
had
a
pleasant
morning.
The
disappointments
got
time
on;
the
fears
and
fits
of
anger
only
made
that
short
discourse
pleasanter,
when
it
came
at
last.
She
expected
to
coax
me
at
once.
She'll
not
manage
that
in
one
effort.
She
shall
come
again,
again,
and
yet
again.
It
would
please
me
to
put
her
in
a
passion
to
make
her
cry.
I
want
to
discover
how
far
she
will
go
what
she
will
do
and
dare
to
get
her
will.
It
seems
strange
and
new
to
find
one
human
being
thinking
so
much
about
another
as
she
thinks
about
Moore.
But
it
is
time
to
go
home;
my
appetite
tells
me
the
hour.
Won't
I
walk
into
that
goose?
and
we'll
try
whether
Matthew
or
I
shall
get
the
largest
cut
of
the
apple
pie
to
day."
Martin
had
planned
well.
He
had
laid
out
a
dexterously
concerted
scheme
for
his
private
amusement.
But
older
and
wiser
schemers
than
he
are
often
doomed
to
see
their
finest
spun
projects
swept
to
annihilation
by
the
sudden
broom
of
Fate,
that
fell
housewife
whose
red
arm
none
can
control.
In
the
present
instance
this
broom
was
manufactured
out
of
the
tough
fibres
of
Moore's
own
stubborn
purpose,
bound
tight
with
his
will.
