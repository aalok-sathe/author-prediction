"
"They
will
miss
you
below."
"No;
the
gentlemen
are
still
at
table."
"They
will
not
linger
long.
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
is
no
wine
bibber,
and
I
hear
him
just
now
pass
from
the
dining
room
to
the
drawing
room."
"It
is
a
servant."
"It
is
Sir
Philip;
I
know
his
step."
"Your
hearing
is
acute."
"It
is
never
dull,
and
the
sense
seems
sharpened
at
present.
Sir
Philip
was
here
to
tea
last
night.
I
heard
you
sing
to
him
some
song
which
he
had
brought
you.
I
heard
him,
when
he
took
his
departure
at
eleven
o'clock,
call
you
out
on
to
the
pavement,
to
look
at
the
evening
star."
"You
must
be
nervously
sensitive."
"I
heard
him
kiss
your
hand."
"Impossible!"
"No:
my
chamber
is
over
the
hall,
the
window
just
above
the
front
door;
the
sash
was
a
little
raised,
for
I
felt
feverish.
You
stood
ten
minutes
with
him
on
the
steps.
I
heard
your
discourse,
every
word,
and
I
heard
the
salute.
Henry,
give
me
some
water."
"Let
me
give
it
him."
But
he
half
rose
to
take
the
glass
from
young
Sympson,
and
declined
her
attendance.
"And
can
I
do
nothing?"
"Nothing;
for
you
cannot
guarantee
me
a
night's
peaceful
rest,
and
it
is
all
I
at
present
want."
"You
do
not
sleep
well?"
"Sleep
has
left
me."
"Yet
you
said
you
were
not
very
ill?"
"I
am
often
sleepless
when
in
high
health."
"If
I
had
power,
I
would
lap
you
in
the
most
placid
slumber
quite
deep
and
hushed,
without
a
dream."
"Blank
annihilation!
I
do
not
ask
that."
"With
dreams
of
all
you
most
desire."
"Monstrous
delusions!
The
sleep
would
be
delirium,
the
waking
death."
"Your
wishes
are
not
so
chimerical;
you
are
no
visionary."
"Miss
Keeldar,
I
suppose
you
think
so;
but
my
character
is
not,
perhaps,
quite
as
legible
to
you
as
a
page
of
the
last
new
novel
might
be."
"That
is
possible.
But
this
sleep
I
should
like
to
woo
it
to
your
pillow,
to
win
for
you
its
favour.
If
I
took
a
book
and
sat
down
and
read
some
pages?
I
can
well
spare
half
an
hour."
"Thank
you,
but
I
will
not
detain
you."
"I
would
read
softly."
"It
would
not
do.
I
am
too
feverish
and
excitable
to
bear
a
soft,
cooing,
vibrating
voice
close
at
my
ear.
You
had
better
leave
me."
"Well,
I
will
go."
"And
no
good
night?"
"Yes,
sir,
yes.
Mr.
Moore,
good
night."
(Exit
Shirley.)
"Henry,
my
boy,
go
to
bed
now;
it
is
time
you
had
some
repose."
"Sir,
it
would
please
me
to
watch
at
your
bedside
all
night."
"Nothing
less
called
for.
I
am
getting
better.
There,
go."
"Give
me
your
blessing,
sir."
"God
bless
you,
my
best
pupil!"
"You
never
call
me
your
dearest
pupil!"
"No,
nor
ever
shall."
Possibly
Miss
Keeldar
resented
her
former
teacher's
rejection
of
her
courtesy.
It
is
certain
she
did
not
repeat
the
offer
of
it.
