am
aware
of
that;
but
cousins,
if
they
are
stupid,
are
still
more
insupportable
than
strangers,
because
you
cannot
so
easily
keep
them
at
a
distance.
But
your
cousin
is
not
stupid?"
"No;
but
"
"Well?"
"If
the
company
of
fools
irritates,
as
you
say,
the
society
of
clever
men
leaves
its
own
peculiar
pain
also.
Where
the
goodness
or
talent
of
your
friend
is
beyond
and
above
all
doubt,
your
own
worthiness
to
be
his
associate
often
becomes
a
matter
of
question."
"Oh!
there
I
cannot
follow
you.
That
crotchet
is
not
one
I
should
choose
to
entertain
for
an
instant.
I
consider
myself
not
unworthy
to
be
the
associate
of
the
best
of
them
of
gentlemen,
I
mean
though
that
is
saying
a
great
deal.
Where
they
are
good,
they
are
very
good,
I
believe.
Your
uncle,
by
the
bye,
is
not
a
bad
specimen
of
the
elderly
gentleman.
I
am
always
glad
to
see
his
brown,
keen,
sensible
old
face,
either
in
my
own
house
or
any
other.
Are
you
fond
of
him?
Is
he
kind
to
you?
Now,
speak
the
truth."
"He
has
brought
me
up
from
childhood,
I
doubt
not,
precisely
as
he
would
have
brought
up
his
own
daughter,
if
he
had
had
one;
and
that
is
kindness.
But
I
am
not
fond
of
him.
I
would
rather
be
out
of
his
presence
than
in
it."
"Strange,
when
he
has
the
art
of
making
himself
so
agreeable."
"Yes,
in
company;
but
he
is
stern
and
silent
at
home.
As
he
puts
away
his
cane
and
shovel
hat
in
the
rectory
hall,
so
he
locks
his
liveliness
in
his
book
case
and
study
desk:
the
knitted
brow
and
brief
word
for
the
fireside;
the
smile,
the
jest,
the
witty
sally
for
society."
"Is
he
tyrannical?"
"Not
in
the
least.
He
is
neither
tyrannical
nor
hypocritical.
He
is
simply
a
man
who
is
rather
liberal
than
good
natured,
rather
brilliant
than
genial,
rather
scrupulously
equitable
than
truly
just
if
you
can
understand
such
superfine
distinctions."
"Oh
yes!
Good
nature
implies
indulgence,
which
he
has
not;
geniality,
warmth
of
heart,
which
he
does
not
own;
and
genuine
justice
is
the
offspring
of
sympathy
and
considerateness,
of
which,
I
can
well
conceive,
my
bronzed
old
friend
is
quite
innocent."
"I
often
wonder,
Shirley,
whether
most
men
resemble
my
uncle
in
their
domestic
relations;
whether
it
is
necessary
to
be
new
and
unfamiliar
to
them
in
order
to
seem
agreeable
or
estimable
in
their
eyes;
and
whether
it
is
impossible
to
their
natures
to
retain
a
constant
interest
and
affection
for
those
they
see
every
day."
"I
don't
know.
I
can't
clear
up
your
doubts.
I
ponder
over
similar
ones
myself
sometimes.
But,
to
tell
you
a
secret,
if
I
were
convinced
that
they
are
necessarily
and
universally
different
from
us
fickle,
soon
petrifying,
unsympathizing
I
would
never
marry.
I
should
not
like
to
find
out
that
what
I
loved
did
not
love
me,
that
it
was
weary
of
