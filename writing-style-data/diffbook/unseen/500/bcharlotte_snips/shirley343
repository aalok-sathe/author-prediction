not
show
that
to
any
one
in
Briarfield
but
you,
because
you
can
take
it
quietly."
"Certainly
there
is
nothing
in
the
little
mark
to
shock.
Its
history
will
explain."
"Small
as
it
is,
it
has
taken
my
sleep
away,
and
made
me
nervous,
thin,
and
foolish;
because,
on
account
of
that
little
mark,
I
am
obliged
to
look
forward
to
a
possibility
that
has
its
terrors."
The
sleeve
was
readjusted,
the
bracelet
replaced.
"Do
you
know
that
you
try
me?"
he
said,
smiling.
"I
am
a
patient
sort
of
man,
but
my
pulse
is
quickening."
"Whatever
happens,
you
will
befriend
me,
Mr.
Moore?
You
will
give
me
the
benefit
of
your
self
possession,
and
not
leave
me
at
the
mercy
of
agitated
cowards?"
"I
make
no
promise
now.
Tell
me
the
tale,
and
then
exact
what
pledge
you
will."
"It
is
a
very
short
tale.
I
took
a
walk
with
Isabella
and
Gertrude
one
day,
about
three
weeks
ago.
They
reached
home
before
me;
I
stayed
behind
to
speak
to
John.
After
leaving
him,
I
pleased
myself
with
lingering
in
the
lane,
where
all
was
very
still
and
shady.
I
was
tired
of
chattering
to
the
girls,
and
in
no
hurry
to
rejoin
them.
As
I
stood
leaning
against
the
gate
pillar,
thinking
some
very
happy
thoughts
about
my
future
life
for
that
morning
I
imagined
that
events
were
beginning
to
turn
as
I
had
long
wished
them
to
turn
"
"Ah!
Nunnely
had
been
with
her
the
evening
before!"
thought
Moore
parenthetically.
"I
heard
a
panting
sound;
a
dog
came
running
up
the
lane.
I
know
most
of
the
dogs
in
this
neighbourhood.
It
was
Pheabe,
one
of
Mr.
Sam
Wynne's
pointers.
The
poor
creature
ran
with
her
head
down,
her
tongue
hanging
out;
she
looked
as
if
bruised
and
beaten
all
over.
I
called
her.
I
meant
to
coax
her
into
the
house
and
give
her
some
water
and
dinner.
I
felt
sure
she
had
been
ill
used.
Mr.
Sam
often
flogs
his
pointers
cruelly.
She
was
too
flurried
to
know
me;
and
when
I
attempted
to
pat
her
head,
she
turned
and
snatched
at
my
arm.
She
bit
it
so
as
to
draw
blood,
then
ran
panting
on.
Directly
after,
Mr.
Wynne's
keeper
came
up,
carrying
a
gun.
He
asked
if
I
had
seen
a
dog.
I
told
him
I
had
seen
Pheabe.
"'You
had
better
chain
up
Tartar,
ma'am,'
he
said,
'and
tell
your
people
to
keep
within
the
house.
I
am
after
Pheabe
to
shoot
her,
and
the
groom
is
gone
another
way.
She
is
raging
mad.'"
Mr.
Moore
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
folded
his
arms
across
his
chest.
Miss
Keeldar
resumed
her
square
of
silk
canvas,
and
continued
the
creation
of
a
wreath
of
Parmese
violets.
"And
you
told
no
one,
sought
no
help,
no
cure?
You
would
not
come
to
me?"
"I
got
as
far
as
the
schoolroom
door;
there
my
courage
failed.
I
preferred
to
cushion
the
matter."
"Why?
