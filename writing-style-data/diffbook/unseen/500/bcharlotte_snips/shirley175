cemetery.
Moore
was
almost
caught.
He
had
to
"dodge"
after
all,
to
coast
round
the
church,
and
finally
to
bend
his
tall
form
behind
the
Wynnes'
ambitious
monument.
There
he
was
forced
to
hide
full
ten
minutes,
kneeling
with
one
knee
on
the
turf,
his
hat
off,
his
curls
bare
to
the
dew,
his
dark
eye
shining,
and
his
lips
parted
with
inward
laughter
at
his
position;
for
the
rector
meantime
stood
coolly
star
gazing,
and
taking
snuff
within
three
feet
of
him.
It
happened,
however,
that
Mr.
Helstone
had
no
suspicion
whatever
on
his
mind;
for
being
usually
but
vaguely
informed
of
his
niece's
movements,
not
thinking
it
worth
while
to
follow
them
closely,
he
was
not
aware
that
she
had
been
out
at
all
that
day,
and
imagined
her
then
occupied
with
book
or
work
in
her
chamber
where,
indeed,
she
was
by
this
time,
though
not
absorbed
in
the
tranquil
employment
he
ascribed
to
her,
but
standing
at
her
window
with
fast
throbbing
heart,
peeping
anxiously
from
behind
the
blind,
watching
for
her
uncle
to
re
enter
and
her
cousin
to
escape.
And
at
last
she
was
gratified.
She
heard
Mr.
Helstone
come
in;
she
saw
Robert
stride
the
tombs
and
vault
the
wall;
she
then
went
down
to
prayers.
When
she
returned
to
her
chamber,
it
was
to
meet
the
memory
of
Robert.
Slumber's
visitation
was
long
averted.
Long
she
sat
at
her
lattice,
long
gazed
down
on
the
old
garden
and
older
church,
on
the
tombs
laid
out
all
gray
and
calm,
and
clear
in
moonlight.
She
followed
the
steps
of
the
night,
on
its
pathway
of
stars,
far
into
the
"wee
sma'
hours
ayont
the
twal'."
She
was
with
Moore,
in
spirit,
the
whole
time;
she
was
at
his
side;
she
heard
his
voice;
she
gave
her
hand
into
his
hand;
it
rested
warm
in
his
fingers.
When
the
church
clock
struck,
when
any
other
sound
stirred,
when
a
little
mouse
familiar
to
her
chamber
an
intruder
for
which
she
would
never
permit
Fanny
to
lay
a
trap
came
rattling
amongst
the
links
of
her
locket
chain,
her
one
ring,
and
another
trinket
or
two
on
the
toilet
table,
to
nibble
a
bit
of
biscuit
laid
ready
for
it,
she
looked
up,
recalled
momentarily
to
the
real.
Then
she
said
half
aloud,
as
if
deprecating
the
accusation
of
some
unseen
and
unheard
monitor,
"I
am
not
cherishing
love
dreams;
I
am
only
thinking
because
I
cannot
sleep.
Of
course,
I
know
he
will
marry
Shirley."
With
returning
silence,
with
the
lull
of
the
chime,
and
the
retreat
of
her
small
untamed
and
unknown
protege,
she
still
resumed
the
dream,
nestling
to
the
vision's
side
listening
to,
conversing
with
it.
It
paled
at
last.
As
dawn
approached,
the
setting
stars
and
breaking
day
dimmed
the
creation
of
fancy;
the
wakened
song
of
birds
hushed
her
whispers.
The
tale
full
of
fire,
quick
with
interest,
borne
away
by
the
morning
wind,
became
a
vague
murmur.
The
