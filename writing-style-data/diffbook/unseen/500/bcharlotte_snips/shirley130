old
and
tenantless
dwelling
yclept
Fieldhead.
Tenantless
by
the
proprietor
it
had
been
for
ten
years,
but
it
was
no
ruin.
Mr.
Yorke
had
seen
it
kept
in
good
repair,
and
an
old
gardener
and
his
wife
had
lived
in
it,
cultivated
the
grounds,
and
maintained
the
house
in
habitable
condition.
If
Fieldhead
had
few
other
merits
as
a
building,
it
might
at
least
be
termed
picturesque.
Its
regular
architecture,
and
the
gray
and
mossy
colouring
communicated
by
time,
gave
it
a
just
claim
to
this
epithet.
The
old
latticed
windows,
the
stone
porch,
the
walls,
the
roof,
the
chimney
stacks,
were
rich
in
crayon
touches
and
sepia
lights
and
shades.
The
trees
behind
were
fine,
bold,
and
spreading;
the
cedar
on
the
lawn
in
front
was
grand;
and
the
granite
urns
on
the
garden
wall,
the
fretted
arch
of
the
gateway,
were,
for
an
artist,
as
the
very
desire
of
the
eye.
One
mild
May
evening
Caroline,
passing
near
about
moonrise,
and
feeling,
though
weary,
unwilling
yet
to
go
home,
where
there
was
only
the
bed
of
thorns
and
the
night
of
grief
to
anticipate,
sat
down
on
the
mossy
ground
near
the
gate,
and
gazed
through
towards
cedar
and
mansion.
It
was
a
still
night
calm,
dewy,
cloudless;
the
gables,
turned
to
the
west,
reflected
the
clear
amber
of
the
horizon
they
faced;
the
oaks
behind
were
black;
the
cedar
was
blacker.
Under
its
dense,
raven
boughs
a
glimpse
of
sky
opened
gravely
blue.
It
was
full
of
the
moon,
which
looked
solemnly
and
mildly
down
on
Caroline
from
beneath
that
sombre
canopy.
She
felt
this
night
and
prospect
mournfully
lovely.
She
wished
she
could
be
happy;
she
wished
she
could
know
inward
peace;
she
wondered
Providence
had
no
pity
on
her,
and
would
not
help
or
console
her.
Recollections
of
happy
trysts
of
lovers,
commemorated
in
old
ballads,
returned
on
her
mind;
she
thought
such
tryst
in
such
scene
would
be
blissful.
Where
now
was
Robert?
she
asked.
Not
at
the
Hollow;
she
had
watched
for
his
lamp
long,
and
had
not
seen
it.
She
questioned
within
herself
whether
she
and
Moore
were
ever
destined
to
meet
and
speak
again.
Suddenly
the
door
within
the
stone
porch
of
the
hall
opened,
and
two
men
came
out
one
elderly
and
white
headed,
the
other
young,
dark
haired,
and
tall.
They
passed
across
the
lawn,
out
through
a
portal
in
the
garden
wall.
Caroline
saw
them
cross
the
road,
pass
the
stile,
descend
the
fields;
she
saw
them
disappear.
Robert
Moore
had
passed
before
her
with
his
friend
Mr.
Yorke.
Neither
had
seen
her.
The
apparition
had
been
transient
scarce
seen
ere
gone;
but
its
electric
passage
left
her
veins
kindled,
her
soul
insurgent.
It
found
her
despairing,
it
left
her
desperate
two
different
states.
"Oh,
had
he
but
been
alone!
had
he
but
seen
me!"
was
her
cry.
"He
would
have
said
something.
He
would
have
given
me
his
hand.
He
does,
he
must,
love
me
a
little.
