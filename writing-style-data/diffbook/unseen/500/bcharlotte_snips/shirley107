and
we'll
keep
him.
But
mind,
Rose,
he's
not
so
much
your
friend
as
he
is
mine.
He
is
my
particular
acquaintance;
remember
that!"
And
she
held
up
her
small
hand
with
an
admonitory
gesture.
Rose
was
quite
accustomed
to
be
admonished
by
that
small
hand.
Her
will
daily
bent
itself
to
that
of
the
impetuous
little
Jessy.
She
was
guided,
overruled
by
Jessy
in
a
thousand
things.
On
all
occasions
of
show
and
pleasure
Jessy
took
the
lead,
and
Rose
fell
quietly
into
the
background;
whereas,
when
the
disagreeables
of
life
its
work
and
privations
were
in
question,
Rose
instinctively
took
upon
her,
in
addition
to
her
own
share,
what
she
could
of
her
sister's.
Jessy
had
already
settled
it
in
her
mind
that
she,
when
she
was
old
enough,
was
to
be
married;
Rose,
she
decided,
must
be
an
old
maid,
to
live
with
her,
look
after
her
children,
keep
her
house.
This
state
of
things
is
not
uncommon
between
two
sisters,
where
one
is
plain
and
the
other
pretty;
but
in
this
case,
if
there
was
a
difference
in
external
appearance,
Rose
had
the
advantage:
her
face
was
more
regular
featured
than
that
of
the
piquant
little
Jessy.
Jessy,
however,
was
destined
to
possess,
along
with
sprightly
intelligence
and
vivacious
feeling,
the
gift
of
fascination,
the
power
to
charm
when,
where,
and
whom
she
would.
Rose
was
to
have
a
fine,
generous
soul,
a
noble
intellect
profoundly
cultivated,
a
heart
as
true
as
steel,
but
the
manner
to
attract
was
not
to
be
hers.
"Now,
Rose,
tell
me
the
name
of
this
lady
who
denied
that
I
was
sentimental,"
urged
Mr.
Moore.
Rose
had
no
idea
of
tantalization,
or
she
would
have
held
him
a
while
in
doubt.
She
answered
briefly,
"I
can't.
I
don't
know
her
name."
"Describe
her
to
me.
What
was
she
like?
Where
did
you
see
her?"
"When
Jessy
and
I
went
to
spend
the
day
at
Whinbury
with
Kate
and
Susan
Pearson,
who
were
just
come
home
from
school,
there
was
a
party
at
Mrs.
Pearson's,
and
some
grown
up
ladies
were
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
drawing
room
talking
about
you."
"Did
you
know
none
of
them?"
"Hannah,
and
Harriet,
and
Dora,
and
Mary
Sykes."
"Good.
Were
they
abusing
me,
Rosy?"
"Some
of
them
were.
They
called
you
a
misanthrope.
I
remember
the
word.
I
looked
for
it
in
the
dictionary
when
I
came
home.
It
means
a
man
hater."
"What
besides?"
"Hannah
Sykes
said
you
were
a
solemn
puppy."
"Better!"
cried
Mr.
Yorke,
laughing.
"Oh,
excellent!
Hannah!
that's
the
one
with
the
red
hair
a
fine
girl,
but
half
witted."
"She
has
wit
enough
for
me,
it
appears,"
said
Moore.
"A
solemn
puppy,
indeed!
Well,
Rose,
go
on."
"Miss
Pearson
said
she
believed
there
was
a
good
deal
of
affectation
about
you,
and
that
with
your
dark
hair
and
pale
face
you
looked
to
her
like
some
sort
of
a
sentimental
noodle."
Again
Mr.
Yorke
laughed.
Mrs.
Yorke
even
