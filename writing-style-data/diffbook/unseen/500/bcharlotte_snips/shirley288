obtained
a
fair
view
of
it.
Her
patient
never
parted
with
it.
When
dressed
it
was
hidden
in
her
bosom;
as
she
lay
in
bed
she
always
held
it
in
her
hand.
That
Tuesday
afternoon
the
transient
doze
more
like
lethargy
than
sleep
which
sometimes
abridged
the
long
days,
had
stolen
over
her.
The
weather
was
hot.
While
turning
in
febrile
restlessness,
she
had
pushed
the
coverlets
a
little
aside.
Mrs.
Pryor
bent
to
replace
them.
The
small,
wasted
hand,
lying
nerveless
on
the
sick
girl's
breast,
clasped
as
usual
her
jealously
guarded
treasure.
Those
fingers
whose
attenuation
it
gave
pain
to
see
were
now
relaxed
in
sleep.
Mrs.
Pryor
gently
disengaged
the
braid,
drawing
out
a
tiny
locket
a
slight
thing
it
was,
such
as
it
suited
her
small
purse
to
purchase.
Under
its
crystal
face
appeared
a
curl
of
black
hair,
too
short
and
crisp
to
have
been
severed
from
a
female
head.
Some
agitated
movement
occasioned
a
twitch
of
the
silken
chain.
The
sleeper
started
and
woke.
Her
thoughts
were
usually
now
somewhat
scattered
on
waking,
her
look
generally
wandering.
Half
rising,
as
if
in
terror,
she
exclaimed,
"Don't
take
it
from
me,
Robert!
Don't!
It
is
my
last
comfort;
let
me
keep
it.
I
never
tell
any
one
whose
hair
it
is;
I
never
show
it."
Mrs.
Pryor
had
already
disappeared
behind
the
curtain.
Reclining
far
back
in
a
deep
arm
chair
by
the
bedside,
she
was
withdrawn
from
view.
Caroline
looked
abroad
into
the
chamber;
she
thought
it
empty.
As
her
stray
ideas
returned
slowly,
each
folding
its
weak
wings
on
the
mind's
sad
shore,
like
birds
exhausted,
beholding
void,
and
perceiving
silence
round
her,
she
believed
herself
alone.
Collected
she
was
not
yet;
perhaps
healthy
self
possession
and
self
control
were
to
be
hers
no
more;
perhaps
that
world
the
strong
and
prosperous
live
in
had
already
rolled
from
beneath
her
feet
for
ever.
So,
at
least,
it
often
seemed
to
herself.
In
health
she
had
never
been
accustomed
to
think
aloud,
but
now
words
escaped
her
lips
unawares.
"Oh,
I
should
see
him
once
more
before
all
is
over!
Heaven
might
favour
me
thus
far!"
she
cried.
"God
grant
me
a
little
comfort
before
I
die!"
was
her
humble
petition.
"But
he
will
not
know
I
am
ill
till
I
am
gone,
and
he
will
come
when
they
have
laid
me
out,
and
I
am
senseless,
cold,
and
stiff.
"What
can
my
departed
soul
feel
then?
Can
it
see
or
know
what
happens
to
the
clay?
Can
spirits,
through
any
medium,
communicate
with
living
flesh?
Can
the
dead
at
all
revisit
those
they
leave?
Can
they
come
in
the
elements?
Will
wind,
water,
fire,
lend
me
a
path
to
Moore?
"Is
it
for
nothing
the
wind
sounds
almost
articulately
sometimes
sings
as
I
have
lately
heard
it
sing
at
night
or
passes
the
casement
sobbing,
as
if
for
sorrow
to
come?
Does
nothing,
then,
haunt
it,
nothing
inspire
it?
"Why,
it
suggested
to
