not
(as
you
know,
reader)
the
Caroline
of
every
day,
thawed
his
reserve,
and
cheered
his
gravity
soon.
He
sat
near
her
and
talked
to
her.
She
already
knew
his
vocation
was
that
of
tuition.
She
learned
now
he
had
for
some
years
been
the
tutor
of
Mr.
Sympson's
son;
that
he
had
been
travelling
with
him,
and
had
accompanied
him
to
the
north.
She
inquired
if
he
liked
his
post,
but
got
a
look
in
reply
which
did
not
invite
or
license
further
question.
The
look
woke
Caroline's
ready
sympathy.
She
thought
it
a
very
sad
expression
to
pass
over
so
sensible
a
face
as
Louis's;
for
he
had
a
sensible
face,
though
not
handsome,
she
considered,
when
seen
near
Robert's.
She
turned
to
make
the
comparison.
Robert
was
leaning
against
the
wall,
a
little
behind
her,
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
book
of
engravings,
and
probably
listening,
at
the
same
time,
to
the
dialogue
between
her
and
Louis.
"How
could
I
think
them
alike?"
she
asked
herself.
"I
see
now
it
is
Hortense
Louis
resembles,
not
Robert."
And
this
was
in
part
true.
He
had
the
shorter
nose
and
longer
upper
lip
of
his
sister
rather
than
the
fine
traits
of
his
brother.
He
had
her
mould
of
mouth
and
chin
all
less
decisive,
accurate,
and
clear
than
those
of
the
young
mill
owner.
His
air,
though
deliberate
and
reflective,
could
scarcely
be
called
prompt
and
acute.
You
felt,
in
sitting
near
and
looking
up
at
him,
that
a
slower
and
probably
a
more
benignant
nature
than
that
of
the
elder
Moore
shed
calm
on
your
impressions.
Robert
perhaps
aware
that
Caroline's
glance
had
wandered
towards
and
dwelt
upon
him,
though
he
had
neither
met
nor
answered
it
put
down
the
book
of
engravings,
and
approaching,
took
a
seat
at
her
side.
She
resumed
her
conversation
with
Louis,
but
while
she
talked
to
him
her
thoughts
were
elsewhere.
Her
heart
beat
on
the
side
from
which
her
face
was
half
averted.
She
acknowledged
a
steady,
manly,
kindly
air
in
Louis;
but
she
bent
before
the
secret
power
of
Robert.
To
be
so
near
him
though
he
was
silent,
though
he
did
not
touch
so
much
as
her
scarf
fringe
or
the
white
hem
of
her
dress
affected
her
like
a
spell.
Had
she
been
obliged
to
speak
to
him
only,
it
would
have
quelled,
but,
at
liberty
to
address
another,
it
excited
her.
Her
discourse
flowed
freely;
it
was
gay,
playful,
eloquent.
The
indulgent
look
and
placid
manner
of
her
auditor
encouraged
her
to
ease;
the
sober
pleasure
expressed
by
his
smile
drew
out
all
that
was
brilliant
in
her
nature.
She
felt
that
this
evening
she
appeared
to
advantage,
and
as
Robert
was
a
spectator,
the
consciousness
contented
her.
Had
he
been
called
away,
collapse
would
at
once
have
succeeded
stimulus.
But
her
enjoyment
was
not
long
to
shine
full
orbed;
a
cloud
soon
crossed
it.

for
some
time
had
been
on
the
