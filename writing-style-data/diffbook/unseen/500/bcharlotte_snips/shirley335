lingered
on
the
countenance,
in
the
manner
of
Miss
Keeldar.
A
strange
quietude
settled
over
her
look,
her
movements,
her
very
voice.
The
alteration
was
not
so
marked
as
to
court
or
permit
frequent
questioning,
yet
it
was
there,
and
it
would
not
pass
away.
It
hung
over
her
like
a
cloud
which
no
breeze
could
stir
or
disperse.
Soon
it
became
evident
that
to
notice
this
change
was
to
annoy
her.
First
she
shrank
from
remark;
and,
if
persisted
in,
she,
with
her
own
peculiar
hauteur,
repelled
it.
"Was
she
ill?"
The
reply
came
with
decision.
"I
am
not."
"Did
anything
weigh
on
her
mind?
Had
anything
happened
to
affect
her
spirits?"
She
scornfully
ridiculed
the
idea.
"What
did
they
mean
by
spirits?
She
had
no
spirits,
black
or
white,
blue
or
gray,
to
affect."
"Something
must
be
the
matter
she
was
so
altered."
"She
supposed
she
had
a
right
to
alter
at
her
ease.
She
knew
she
was
plainer.
If
it
suited
her
to
grow
ugly,
why
need
others
fret
themselves
on
the
subject?"
"There
must
be
a
cause
for
the
change.
What
was
it?"
She
peremptorily
requested
to
be
let
alone.
Then
she
would
make
every
effort
to
appear
quite
gay,
and
she
seemed
indignant
at
herself
that
she
could
not
perfectly
succeed.
Brief
self
spurning
epithets
burst
from
her
lips
when
alone.
"Fool!
coward!"
she
would
term
herself.
"Poltroon!"
she
would
say,
"if
you
must
tremble,
tremble
in
secret!
Quail
where
no
eye
sees
you!"
"How
dare
you,"
she
would
ask
herself
"how
dare
you
show
your
weakness
and
betray
your
imbecile
anxieties?
Shake
them
off;
rise
above
them.
If
you
cannot
do
this,
hide
them."
And
to
hide
them
she
did
her
best.
She
once
more
became
resolutely
lively
in
company.
When
weary
of
effort
and
forced
to
relax,
she
sought
solitude
not
the
solitude
of
her
chamber
(she
refused
to
mope,
shut
up
between
four
walls),
but
that
wilder
solitude
which
lies
out
of
doors,
and
which
she
could
chase,
mounted
on
Zoe,
her
mare.
She
took
long
rides
of
half
a
day.
Her
uncle
disapproved,
but
he
dared
not
remonstrate.
It
was
never
pleasant
to
face
Shirley's
anger,
even
when
she
was
healthy
and
gay;
but
now
that
her
face
showed
thin,
and
her
large
eye
looked
hollow,
there
was
something
in
the
darkening
of
that
face
and
kindling
of
that
eye
which
touched
as
well
as
alarmed.
To
all
comparative
strangers
who,
unconscious
of
the
alterations
in
her
spirits,
commented
on
the
alteration
in
her
looks,
she
had
one
reply,
"I
am
perfectly
well;
I
have
not
an
ailment."
And
health,
indeed,
she
must
have
had,
to
be
able
to
bear
the
exposure
to
the
weather
she
now
encountered.
Wet
or
fair,
calm
or
storm,
she
took
her
daily
ride
over
Stilbro'
Moor,
Tartar
keeping
up
at
her
side,
with
his
wolf
like
gallop,
long
and
untiring.
Twice,
three
times,
the
eyes
of
gossips
those
eyes
which
are
everywhere,
in
the
closet
