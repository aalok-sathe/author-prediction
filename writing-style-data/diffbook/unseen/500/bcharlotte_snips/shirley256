kind
to
me;
but
when
people
are
long
indifferent
to
us,
we
grow
indifferent
to
their
indifference.
It
is
my
uncle's
way
not
to
care
for
women
and
girls,
unless
they
be
ladies
that
he
meets
in
company.
He
could
not
alter,
and
I
have
no
wish
that
he
should
alter,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned.
I
believe
it
would
merely
annoy
and
frighten
me
were
he
to
be
affectionate
towards
me
now.
But
you
know,
Mrs.
Pryor,
it
is
scarcely
living
to
measure
time
as
I
do
at
the
rectory.
The
hours
pass,
and
I
get
them
over
somehow,
but
I
do
not
live.
I
endure
existence,
but
I
rarely
enjoy
it.
Since
Miss
Keeldar
and
you
came
I
have
been
I
was
going
to
say
happier,
but
that
would
be
untrue."
She
paused.
"How
untrue?
You
are
fond
of
Miss
Keeldar,
are
you
not,
my
dear?"
"Very
fond
of
Shirley.
I
both
like
and
admire
her.
But
I
am
painfully
circumstanced.
For
a
reason
I
cannot
explain
I
want
to
go
away
from
this
place,
and
to
forget
it."
"You
told
me
before
you
wished
to
be
a
governess;
but,
my
dear,
if
you
remember,
I
did
not
encourage
the
idea.
I
have
been
a
governess
myself
great
part
of
my
life.
In
Miss
Keeldar's
acquaintance
I
esteem
myself
most
fortunate.
Her
talents
and
her
really
sweet
disposition
have
rendered
my
office
easy
to
me;
but
when
I
was
young,
before
I
married,
my
trials
were
severe,
poignant.
I
should
not
like
a
I
should
not
like
you
to
endure
similar
ones.
It
was
my
lot
to
enter
a
family
of
considerable
pretensions
to
good
birth
and
mental
superiority,
and
the
members
of
which
also
believed
that
'on
them
was
perceptible'
an
unusual
endowment
of
the
'Christian
graces;'
that
all
their
hearts
were
regenerate,
and
their
spirits
in
a
peculiar
state
of
discipline.
I
was
early
given
to
understand
that
'as
I
was
not
their
equal,'
so
I
could
not
expect
'to
have
their
sympathy.'
It
was
in
no
sort
concealed
from
me
that
I
was
held
a
'burden
and
a
restraint
in
society.'
The
gentlemen,
I
found,
regarded
me
as
a
'tabooed
woman,'
to
whom
'they
were
interdicted
from
granting
the
usual
privileges
of
the
sex,'
and
yet
'who
annoyed
them
by
frequently
crossing
their
path.'
The
ladies
too
made
it
plain
that
they
thought
me
'a
bore.'
The
servants,
it
was
signified,
'detested
me;'
why,
I
could
never
clearly
comprehend.
My
pupils,
I
was
told,
'however
much
they
might
love
me,
and
how
deep
soever
the
interest
I
might
take
in
them,
could
not
be
my
friends.'
It
was
intimated
that
I
must
'live
alone,
and
never
transgress
the
invisible
but
rigid
line
which
established
the
difference
between
me
and
my
employers.'
My
life
in
this
house
was
sedentary,
solitary,
constrained,
joyless,
toilsome.
The
dreadful
crushing
of
the
animal
spirits,
the
ever
prevailing
sense
of
friendlessness
and
homelessness
consequent
on
this
state
of
things
began
