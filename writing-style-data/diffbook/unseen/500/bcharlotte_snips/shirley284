ordering
supper,
and
was
now
clearing
the
little
table
of
some
books,
etc.,
to
make
room
for
the
tray,
called
Robert's
attention
to
the
glass
of
flowers,
the
carmine
and
snow
and
gold
of
whose
petals
looked
radiant
indeed
by
candlelight.
"They
came
from
Fieldhead,"
she
said,
"intended
as
a
gift
to
you,
no
doubt.
We
know
who
is
the
favourite
there;
not
I,
I'm
sure."
It
was
a
wonder
to
hear
Hortense
jest
a
sign
that
her
spirits
were
at
high
water
mark
indeed.
"We
are
to
understand,
then,
that
Robert
is
the
favourite?"
observed
Louis.
"Mon
cher,"
replied
Hortense,
"Robert
c'est
tout
ce
qu'il
y
a
de
plus
precieux
au
monde;
a
cote
de
lui
le
reste
du
genre
humain
n'est
que
du
rebut.
N'ai
je
pas
raison,
mon
enfant?"
she
added,
appealing
to
Caroline.
Caroline
was
obliged
to
reply,
"Yes,"
and
her
beacon
was
quenched.
Her
star
withdrew
as
she
spoke.
"Et
toi,
Robert?"
inquired
Louis.
"When
you
shall
have
an
opportunity,
ask
herself,"
was
the
quiet
answer.
Whether
he
reddened
or
paled
Caroline
did
not
examine.
She
discovered
that
it
was
late,
and
she
must
go
home.
Home
she
would
go;
not
even
Robert
could
detain
her
now.
The
future
sometimes
seems
to
sob
a
low
warning
of
the
events
it
is
bringing
us,
like
some
gathering
though
yet
remote
storm,
which,
in
tones
of
the
wind,
in
flushings
of
the
firmament,
in
clouds
strangely
torn,
announces
a
blast
strong
to
strew
the
sea
with
wrecks;
or
commissioned
to
bring
in
fog
the
yellow
taint
of
pestilence
covering
white
Western
isles
with
the
poisoned
exhalations
of
the
East,
dimming
the
lattices
of
English
homes
with
the
breath
of
Indian
plague.
At
other
times
this
future
bursts
suddenly,
as
if
a
rock
had
rent,
and
in
it
a
grave
had
opened,
whence
issues
the
body
of
one
that
slept.
Ere
you
are
aware
you
stand
face
to
face
with
a
shrouded
and
unthought
of
calamity
a
new
Lazarus.
Caroline
Helstone
went
home
from
Hollow's
Cottage
in
good
health,
as
she
imagined.
On
waking
the
next
morning
she
felt
oppressed
with
unwonted
languor.
At
breakfast,
at
each
meal
of
the
following
day,
she
missed
all
sense
of
appetite.
Palatable
food
was
as
ashes
and
sawdust
to
her.
"Am
I
ill?"
she
asked,
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass.
Her
eyes
were
bright,
their
pupils
dilated,
her
cheeks
seemed
rosier,
and
fuller
than
usual.
"I
look
well;
why
can
I
not
eat?"
She
felt
a
pulse
beat
fast
in
her
temples;
she
felt,
too,
her
brain
in
strange
activity.
Her
spirits
were
raised;
hundreds
of
busy
and
broken
but
brilliant
thoughts
engaged
her
mind.
A
glow
rested
on
them,
such
as
tinged
her
complexion.
Now
followed
a
hot,
parched,
thirsty,
restless
night.
Towards
morning
one
terrible
dream
seized
her
like
a
tiger;
when
she
woke,
she
felt
and
knew
she
was
ill.
How
she
had
caught
the
fever
(fever
it
was)
she
could
not
tell.
Probably
in
her
