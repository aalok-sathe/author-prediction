and
their
countenances
are
so
distinctly
apparent,
who
can
resist
the
attraction
of
such
interest?
Caroline,
it
seems,
cannot,
for
she
lingers.
There
was
a
time
when,
on
summer
nights,
Moore
had
been
wont
to
walk
with
his
cousin,
as
he
was
now
walking
with
the
heiress.
Often
had
she
gone
up
the
Hollow
with
him
after
sunset,
to
scent
the
freshness
of
the
earth,
where
a
growth
of
fragrant
herbage
carpeted
a
certain
narrow
terrace,
edging
a
deep
ravine,
from
whose
rifted
gloom
was
heard
a
sound
like
the
spirit
of
the
lonely
watercourse,
moaning
amongst
its
wet
stones,
and
between
its
weedy
banks,
and
under
its
dark
bower
of
alders.
"But
I
used
to
be
closer
to
him,"
thought
Caroline.
"He
felt
no
obligation
to
treat
me
with
homage;
I
needed
only
kindness.
He
used
to
hold
my
hand;
he
does
not
touch
hers.
And
yet
Shirley
is
not
proud
where
she
loves.
There
is
no
haughtiness
in
her
aspect
now,
only
a
little
in
her
port
what
is
natural
to
and
inseparable
from
her,
what
she
retains
in
her
most
careless
as
in
her
most
guarded
moments.
Robert
must
think,
as
I
think,
that
he
is
at
this
instant
looking
down
on
a
fine
face;
and
he
must
think
it
with
a
man's
brain,
not
with
mine.
She
has
such
generous
yet
soft
fire
in
her
eyes.
She
smiles
what
makes
her
smile
so
sweet?
I
saw
that
Robert
felt
its
beauty,
and
he
must
have
felt
it
with
his
man's
heart,
not
with
my
dim
woman's
perceptions.
They
look
to
me
like
two
great
happy
spirits.
Yonder
silvered
pavement
reminds
me
of
that
white
shore
we
believe
to
be
beyond
the
death
flood.
They
have
reached
it;
they
walk
there
united.
And
what
am
I,
standing
here
in
shadow,
shrinking
into
concealment,
my
mind
darker
than
my
hiding
place?
I
am
one
of
this
world,
no
spirit
a
poor
doomed
mortal,
who
asks,
in
ignorance
and
hopelessness,
wherefore
she
was
born,
to
what
end
she
lives;
whose
mind
for
ever
runs
on
the
question,
how
she
shall
at
last
encounter,
and
by
whom
be
sustained
through
death.
"This
is
the
worst
passage
I
have
come
to
yet;
still
I
was
quite
prepared
for
it.
I
gave
Robert
up,
and
gave
him
up
to
Shirley,
the
first
day
I
heard
she
was
come,
the
first
moment
I
saw
her
rich,
youthful,
and
lovely.
She
has
him
now.
He
is
her
lover.
She
is
his
darling.
She
will
be
far
more
his
darling
yet
when
they
are
married.
The
more
Robert
knows
of
Shirley
the
more
his
soul
will
cleave
to
her.
They
will
both
be
happy,
and
I
do
not
grudge
them
their
bliss;
but
I
groan
under
my
own
misery.
Some
of
my
suffering
is
very
acute.
Truly
I
ought
not
to
have
been
born;
they
should
have
smothered
me
at
the
first
cry."
Here,
Shirley
stepping
aside
to
gather
a
dewy
flower,
she
and
her
