developed
to
excellence.
I
esteem
and
approve
my
child
as
highly
as
I
do
most
fondly
love
her."
"Is
what
I
hear
true?
Is
it
no
dream?"
"I
wish
it
were
as
true
that
the
substance
and
colour
of
health
were
restored
to
your
cheek."
"My
own
mother!
is
she
one
I
can
be
so
fond
of
as
I
can
of
you?
People
generally
did
not
like
her
so
I
have
been
given
to
understand."
"They
told
you
that?
Well,
your
mother
now
tells
you
that,
not
having
the
gift
to
please
people
generally,
for
their
approbation
she
does
not
care.
Her
thoughts
are
centred
in
her
child.
Does
that
child
welcome
or
reject
her?"
"But
if
you
are
my
mother,
the
world
is
all
changed
to
me.
Surely
I
can
live.
I
should
like
to
recover
"
"You
must
recover.
You
drew
life
and
strength
from
my
breast
when
you
were
a
tiny,
fair
infant,
over
whose
blue
eyes
I
used
to
weep,
fearing
I
beheld
in
your
very
beauty
the
sign
of
qualities
that
had
entered
my
heart
like
iron,
and
pierced
through
my
soul
like
a
sword.
Daughter!
we
have
been
long
parted;
I
return
now
to
cherish
you
again."
She
held
her
to
her
bosom;
she
cradled
her
in
her
arms;
she
rocked
her
softly,
as
if
lulling
a
young
child
to
sleep.
"My
mother
my
own
mother!"
The
offspring
nestled
to
the
parent;
that
parent,
feeling
the
endearment
and
hearing
the
appeal,
gathered
her
closer
still.
She
covered
her
with
noiseless
kisses;
she
murmured
love
over
her,
like
a
cushat
fostering
its
young.
There
was
silence
in
the
room
for
a
long
while.
"Does
my
uncle
know?"
"Your
uncle
knows.
I
told
him
when
I
first
came
to
stay
with
you
here."
"Did
you
recognize
me
when
we
first
met
at
Fieldhead?"
"How
could
it
be
otherwise?
Mr.
and
Miss
Helstone
being
announced,
I
was
prepared
to
see
my
child."
"It
was
that,
then,
which
moved
you.
I
saw
you
disturbed."
"You
saw
nothing,
Caroline;
I
can
cover
my
feelings.
You
can
never
tell
what
an
age
of
strange
sensation
I
lived,
during
the
two
minutes
that
elapsed
between
the
report
of
your
name
and
your
entrance.
You
can
never
tell
how
your
look,
mien,
carriage,
shook
me."
"Why?
Were
you
disappointed?"
"What
will
she
be
like?
I
had
asked
myself;
and
when
I
saw
what
you
were
like,
I
could
have
dropped."
"Mamma,
why?"
"I
trembled
in
your
presence.
I
said,
I
will
never
own
her;
she
shall
never
know
me."
"But
I
said
and
did
nothing
remarkable.
I
felt
a
little
diffident
at
the
thought
of
an
introduction
to
strangers
that
was
all."
"I
soon
saw
you
were
diffident.
That
was
the
first
thing
which
reassured
me.
Had
you
been
rustic,
clownish,
awkward,
I
should
have
been
content."
"You
puzzle
me."
"I
had
reason
to
dread
a
fair
outside,
to
mistrust
a
popular
bearing,
to
shudder
before
distinction,
grace,
and
courtesy.
Beauty
