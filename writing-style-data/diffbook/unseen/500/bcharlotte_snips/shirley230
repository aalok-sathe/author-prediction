degrees
comprehended
its
extent.
It
was
not
the
tread
of
two,
nor
of
a
dozen,
nor
of
a
score
of
men;
it
was
the
tread
of
hundreds.
They
could
see
nothing;
the
high
shrubs
of
the
garden
formed
a
leafy
screen
between
them
and
the
road.
To
hear,
however,
was
not
enough,
and
this
they
felt
as
the
troop
trod
forwards,
and
seemed
actually
passing
the
rectory.
They
felt
it
more
when
a
human
voice
though
that
voice
spoke
but
one
word
broke
the
hush
of
the
night.
"Halt!"
A
halt
followed.
The
march
was
arrested.
Then
came
a
low
conference,
of
which
no
word
was
distinguishable
from
the
dining
room.
"We
must
hear
this,"
said
Shirley.
She
turned,
took
her
pistols
from
the
table,
silently
passed
out
through
the
middle
window
of
the
dining
room,
which
was,
in
fact,
a
glass
door,
stole
down
the
walk
to
the
garden
wall,
and
stood
listening
under
the
lilacs.
Caroline
would
not
have
quitted
the
house
had
she
been
alone,
but
where
Shirley
went
she
would
go.
She
glanced
at
the
weapon
on
the
sideboard,
but
left
it
behind
her,
and
presently
stood
at
her
friend's
side.
They
dared
not
look
over
the
wall,
for
fear
of
being
seen;
they
were
obliged
to
crouch
behind
it.
They
heard
these
words,
"It
looks
a
rambling
old
building.
Who
lives
in
it
besides
the
damned
parson?"
"Only
three
women
his
niece
and
two
servants."
"Do
you
know
where
they
sleep?"
"The
lasses
behind;
the
niece
in
a
front
room."
"And
Helstone?"
"Yonder
is
his
chamber.
He
was
burning
a
light,
but
I
see
none
now."
"Where
would
you
get
in?"
"If
I
were
ordered
to
do
his
job
and
he
desarves
it
I'd
try
yond'
long
window;
it
opens
to
the
dining
room.
I
could
grope
my
way
upstairs,
and
I
know
his
chamber."
"How
would
you
manage
about
the
women
folk?"
"Let
'em
alone
except
they
shrieked,
and
then
I'd
soon
quieten
'em.
I
could
wish
to
find
the
old
chap
asleep.
If
he
waked,
he'd
be
dangerous."
"Has
he
arms?"
"Firearms,
allus
and
allus
loadened."
"Then
you're
a
fool
to
stop
us
here.
A
shot
would
give
the
alarm.
Moore
would
be
on
us
before
we
could
turn
round.
We
should
miss
our
main
object."
"You
might
go
on,
I
tell
you.
I'd
engage
Helstone
alone."
A
pause.
One
of
the
party
dropped
some
weapon,
which
rang
on
the
stone
causeway.
At
this
sound
the
rectory
dog
barked
again
furiously
fiercely.
"That
spoils
all!"
said
the
voice.
"He'll
awake.
A
noise
like
that
might
rouse
the
dead.
You
did
not
say
there
was
a
dog.
Damn
you!
Forward!"
Forward
they
went
tramp,
tramp
with
mustering,
manifold,
slow
filing
tread.
They
were
gone.
Shirley
stood
erect,
looked
over
the
wall,
along
the
road.
"Not
a
soul
remains,"
she
said.
She
stood
and
mused.
"Thank
God!"
was
the
next
observation.
Caroline
repeated
the
ejaculation
not
in
so
steady
a
tone.
She
was
trembling
much.
