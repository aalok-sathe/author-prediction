glance
at
the
speaker
from
her
deep,
expressive
eyes.
"You
are
his
friend,
at
any
rate,"
she
said.
"You
defend
him
in
his
absence."
"I
am
both
his
friend
and
his
relative,"
was
the
prompt
reply.
"Robert
Moore
is
my
cousin."
"Oh,
then,
you
can
tell
me
all
about
him.
Just
give
me
a
sketch
of
his
character."
Insuperable
embarrassment
seized
Caroline
when
this
demand
was
made.
She
could
not,
and
did
not,
attempt
to
comply
with
it.
Her
silence
was
immediately
covered
by
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
proceeded
to
address
sundry
questions
to
Mr.
Helstone
regarding
a
family
or
two
in
the
neighbourhood,
with
whose
connections
in
the
south
she
said
she
was
acquainted.
Shirley
soon
withdrew
her
gaze
from
Miss
Helstone's
face.
She
did
not
renew
her
interrogations,
but
returning
to
her
flowers,
proceeded
to
choose
a
nosegay
for
the
rector.
She
presented
it
to
him
as
he
took
leave,
and
received
the
homage
of
a
salute
on
the
hand
in
return.
"Be
sure
you
wear
it
for
my
sake,"
said
she.
"Next
my
heart,
of
course,"
responded
Helstone.
"Mrs.
Pryor,
take
care
of
this
future
magistrate,
this
churchwarden
in
perspective,
this
captain
of
yeomanry,
this
young
squire
of
Briarfield,
in
a
word.
Don't
let
him
exert
himself
too
much;
don't
let
him
break
his
neck
in
hunting;
especially,
let
him
mind
how
he
rides
down
that
dangerous
hill
near
the
Hollow."
"I
like
a
descent,"
said
Shirley;
"I
like
to
clear
it
rapidly;
and
especially
I
like
that
romantic
Hollow
with
all
my
heart."
"Romantic,
with
a
mill
in
it?"
"Romantic
with
a
mill
in
it.
The
old
mill
and
the
white
cottage
are
each
admirable
in
its
way."
"And
the
counting
house,
Mr.
Keeldar?"
"The
counting
house
is
better
than
my
bloom
coloured
drawing
room.
I
adore
the
counting
house."
"And
the
trade?
The
cloth,
the
greasy
wool,
the
polluting
dyeing
vats?"
"The
trade
is
to
be
thoroughly
respected."
"And
the
tradesman
is
a
hero?
Good!"
"I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so.
I
thought
the
tradesman
looked
heroic."
Mischief,
spirit,
and
glee
sparkled
all
over
her
face
as
she
thus
bandied
words
with
the
old
Cossack,
who
almost
equally
enjoyed
the
tilt.
"Captain
Keeldar,
you
have
no
mercantile
blood
in
your
veins.
Why
are
you
so
fond
of
trade?"
"Because
I
am
a
mill
owner,
of
course.
Half
my
income
comes
from
the
works
in
that
Hollow."
"Don't
enter
into
partnership
that's
all."
"You've
put
it
into
my
head!
you've
put
it
into
my
head!"
she
exclaimed,
with
a
joyous
laugh.
"It
will
never
get
out.
Thank
you."
And
waving
her
hand,
white
as
a
lily
and
fine
as
a
fairy's,
she
vanished
within
the
porch,
while
the
rector
and
his
niece
passed
out
through
the
arched
gateway.
Shirley
showed
she
had
been
sincere
in
saying
she
should
be
glad
of
Caroline's
society,
by
frequently
seeking
it;
and,
indeed,
if
she
had
not
sought
it,
she
would
not
have
had
it,
for
Miss
Helstone
was
