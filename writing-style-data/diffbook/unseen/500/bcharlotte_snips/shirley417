or
sing
the
very
songs
you
have
caught
up
by
ear
from
my
voice.
I
do
not
ask
whence
flows
the
feeling
which
you
pour
into
these
songs,
for
I
know
it
flows
out
of
your
heart,
Miss
Keeldar.
In
the
winter
evenings
Tartar
lies
at
your
feet.
You
suffer
him
to
rest
his
head
on
your
perfumed
lap;
you
let
him
couch
on
the
borders
of
your
satin
raiment.
His
rough
hide
is
familiar
with
the
contact
of
your
hand.
I
once
saw
you
kiss
him
on
that
snow
white
beauty
spot
which
stars
his
broad
forehead.
It
is
dangerous
to
say
I
am
like
Tartar;
it
suggests
to
me
a
claim
to
be
treated
like
Tartar.'
"'Perhaps,
sir,
you
can
extort
as
much
from
your
penniless
and
friendless
young
orphan
girl,
when
you
find
her.'
"'Oh
could
I
find
her
such
as
I
image
her!
Something
to
tame
first,
and
teach
afterwards;
to
break
in,
and
then
to
fondle.
To
lift
the
destitute
proud
thing
out
of
poverty;
to
establish
power
over
and
then
to
be
indulgent
to
the
capricious
moods
that
never
were
influenced
and
never
indulged
before;
to
see
her
alternately
irritated
and
subdued
about
twelve
times
in
the
twenty
four
hours;
and
perhaps,
eventually,
when
her
training
was
accomplished,
to
behold
her
the
exemplary
and
patient
mother
of
about
a
dozen
children,
only
now
and
then
lending
little
Louis
a
cordial
cuff
by
way
of
paying
the
interest
of
the
vast
debt
she
owes
his
father.
Oh'
(I
went
on),
'my
orphan
girl
would
give
me
many
a
kiss;
she
would
watch
on
the
threshold
for
my
coming
home
of
an
evening;
she
would
run
into
my
arms;
she
would
keep
my
hearth
as
bright
as
she
would
make
it
warm.
God
bless
the
sweet
idea!
Find
her
I
must.'
"Her
eyes
emitted
an
eager
flash,
her
lips
opened;
but
she
reclosed
them,
and
impetuously
turned
away.
"'Tell
me,
tell
me
where
she
is,
Miss
Keeldar!'
"Another
movement,
all
haughtiness
and
fire
and
impulse.
"'I
must
know.
You
can
tell
me;
you
shall
tell
me.'
"'I
never
will.'
"She
turned
to
leave
me.
Could
I
now
let
her
part
as
she
had
always
parted
from
me?
No.
I
had
gone
too
far
not
to
finish;
I
had
come
too
near
the
end
not
to
drive
home
to
it.
All
the
encumbrance
of
doubt,
all
the
rubbish
of
indecision,
must
be
removed
at
once,
and
the
plain
truth
must
be
ascertained.
She
must
take
her
part,
and
tell
me
what
it
was;
I
must
take
mine
and
adhere
to
it.
"'A
minute,
madam,'
I
said,
keeping
my
hand
on
the
door
handle
before
I
opened
it.
'We
have
had
a
long
conversation
this
morning,
but
the
last
word
has
not
been
spoken
yet.
It
is
yours
to
speak
it.'
"'May
I
pass?'
"'No;
I
guard
the
door.
I
would
almost
rather
die
than
let
you
leave
me
just
now,
without
speaking
the
word
I
demand.'
"'What
