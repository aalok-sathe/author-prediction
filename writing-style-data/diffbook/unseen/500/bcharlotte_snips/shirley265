by
glad
hills,
all
verdure
and
light,
she
reaches
a
station
scarcely
lower
than
that
whence
angels
looked
down
on
the
dreamer
of
Bethel,
and
her
eye
seeks,
and
her
soul
possesses,
the
vision
of
life
as
she
wishes
it.
No,
not
as
she
wishes
it;
she
has
not
time
to
wish.
The
swift
glory
spreads
out,
sweeping
and
kindling,
and
multiplies
its
splendours
faster
than
Thought
can
effect
his
combinations,
faster
than
Aspiration
can
utter
her
longings.
Shirley
says
nothing
while
the
trance
is
upon
her
she
is
quite
mute;
but
if
Mrs.
Pryor
speaks
to
her
now,
she
goes
out
quietly,
and
continues
her
walk
upstairs
in
the
dim
gallery.
If
Shirley
were
not
an
indolent,
a
reckless,
an
ignorant
being,
she
would
take
a
pen
at
such
moments,
or
at
least
while
the
recollection
of
such
moments
was
yet
fresh
on
her
spirit.
She
would
seize,
she
would
fix
the
apparition,
tell
the
vision
revealed.
Had
she
a
little
more
of
the
organ
of
acquisitiveness
in
her
head,
a
little
more
of
the
love
of
property
in
her
nature,
she
would
take
a
good
sized
sheet
of
paper
and
write
plainly
out,
in
her
own
queer
but
clear
and
legible
hand,
the
story
that
has
been
narrated,
the
song
that
has
been
sung
to
her,
and
thus
possess
what
she
was
enabled
to
create.
But
indolent
she
is,
reckless
she
is,
and
most
ignorant;
for
she
does
not
know
her
dreams
are
rare,
her
feelings
peculiar.
She
does
not
know,
has
never
known,
and
will
die
without
knowing,
the
full
value
of
that
spring
whose
bright
fresh
bubbling
in
her
heart
keeps
it
green.
Shirley
takes
life
easily.
Is
not
that
fact
written
in
her
eye?
In
her
good
tempered
moments
is
it
not
as
full
of
lazy
softness
as
in
her
brief
fits
of
anger
it
is
fulgent
with
quick
flashing
fire?
Her
nature
is
in
her
eye.
So
long
as
she
is
calm,
indolence,
indulgence,
humour,
and
tenderness
possess
that
large
gray
sphere;
incense
her,
a
red
ray
pierces
the
dew,
it
quickens
instantly
to
flame.
Ere
the
month
of
July
was
past,
Miss
Keeldar
would
probably
have
started
with
Caroline
on
that
northern
tour
they
had
planned;
but
just
at
that
epoch
an
invasion
befell
Fieldhead.
A
genteel
foraging
party
besieged
Shirley
in
her
castle,
and
compelled
her
to
surrender
at
discretion.
An
uncle,
an
aunt,
and
two
cousins
from
the
south
a
Mr.,
Mrs.,
and
two
Misses
Sympson,
of
Sympson
Grove,
shire
came
down
upon
her
in
state.
The
laws
of
hospitality
obliged
her
to
give
in,
which
she
did
with
a
facility
which
somewhat
surprised
Caroline,
who
knew
her
to
be
prompt
in
action
and
fertile
in
expedient
where
a
victory
was
to
be
gained
for
her
will.
Miss
Helstone
even
asked
her
how
it
was
she
submitted
so
readily.
She
answered,
old
feelings
had
their
power;
she
had
passed
two
years
of
her
early
youth
at
Sympson
Grove.
