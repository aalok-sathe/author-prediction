man
just
the
height
of
Robert.
For
one
second
she
thought
it
was
Robert
for
one
second
she
exulted;
but
the
voice
asking
for
Mr.
Helstone
undeceived
her.
That
voice
was
an
Irish
voice,
consequently
not
Moore's,
but
the
curate's
Malone's.
He
was
ushered
into
the
dining
room,
where,
doubtless,
he
speedily
helped
his
rector
to
empty
the
decanters.
It
was
a
fact
to
be
noted,
that
at
whatever
house
in
Briarfield,
Whinbury,
or
Nunnely
one
curate
dropped
in
to
a
meal
dinner
or
tea,
as,
the
case
might
be
another
presently
followed,
often
two
more.
Not
that
they
gave
each
other
the
rendezvous,
but
they
were
usually
all
on
the
run
at
the
same
time;
and
when
Donne,
for
instance,
sought
Malone
at
his
lodgings
and
found
him
not,
he
inquired
whither
he
had
posted,
and
having
learned
of
the
landlady
his
destination,
hastened
with
all
speed
after
him.
The
same
causes
operated
in
the
same
way
with
Sweeting.
Thus
it
chanced
on
that
afternoon
that
Caroline's
ears
were
three
times
tortured
with
the
ringing
of
the
bell
and
the
advent
of
undesired
guests;
for
Donne
followed
Malone,
and
Sweeting
followed
Donne;
and
more
wine
was
ordered
up
from
the
cellar
into
the
dining
room
(for
though
old
Helstone
chid
the
inferior
priesthood
when
he
found
them
"carousing,"
as
he
called
it,
in
their
own
tents,
yet
at
his
hierarchical
table
he
ever
liked
to
treat
them
to
a
glass
of
his
best),
and
through
the
closed
doors
Caroline
heard
their
boyish
laughter,
and
the
vacant
cackle
of
their
voices.
Her
fear
was
lest
they
should
stay
to
tea,
for
she
had
no
pleasure
in
making
tea
for
that
particular
trio.
What
distinctions
people
draw!
These
three
were
men
young
men
educated
men,
like
Moore;
yet,
for
her,
how
great
the
difference!
Their
society
was
a
bore
his
a
delight.
Not
only
was
she
destined
to
be
favoured
with
their
clerical
company,
but
Fortune
was
at
this
moment
bringing
her
four
other
guests
lady
guests,
all
packed
in
a
pony
phaeton
now
rolling
somewhat
heavily
along
the
road
from
Whinbury:
an
elderly
lady
and
three
of
her
buxom
daughters
were
coming
to
see
her
"in
a
friendly
way,"
as
the
custom
of
that
neighbourhood
was.
Yes,
a
fourth
time
the
bell
clanged.
Fanny
brought
the
present
announcement
to
the
drawing
room,
"Mrs.
Sykes
and
the
three
Misses
Sykes."
When
Caroline
was
going
to
receive
company,
her
habit
was
to
wring
her
hands
very
nervously,
to
flush
a
little,
and
come
forward
hurriedly
yet
hesitatingly,
wishing
herself
meantime
at
Jericho.
She
was,
at
such
crises,
sadly
deficient
in
finished
manner,
though
she
had
once
been
at
school
a
year.
Accordingly,
on
this
occasion,
her
small
white
hands
sadly
maltreated
each
other,
while
she
stood
up,
waiting
the
entrance
of
Mrs.
Sykes.
In
stalked
that
lady,
a
tall,
bilious
gentlewoman,
who
made
an
ample
and
not
altogether
insincere
profession
of
piety,
and
was
greatly
given
to
hospitality
towards
the
clergy.
