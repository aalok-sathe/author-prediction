excused
this.
She
knew
something
of
the
benevolence
of
the
heart
which
beat
under
that
starched
kerchief;
all
the
neighbourhood
at
least
all
the
female
neighbourhood
knew
something
of
it.
No
one
spoke
against
Miss
Ainley
except
lively
young
gentlemen
and
inconsiderate
old
ones,
who
declared
her
hideous.
Caroline
was
soon
at
home
in
that
tiny
parlour.
A
kind
hand
took
from
her
her
shawl
and
bonnet,
and
installed
her
in
the
most
comfortable
seat
near
the
fire.
The
young
and
the
antiquated
woman
were
presently
deep
in
kindly
conversation,
and
soon
Caroline
became
aware
of
the
power
a
most
serene,
unselfish,
and
benignant
mind
could
exercise
over
those
to
whom
it
was
developed.
She
talked
never
of
herself,
always
of
others.
Their
faults
she
passed
over.
Her
theme
was
their
wants,
which
she
sought
to
supply;
their
sufferings,
which
she
longed
to
alleviate.
She
was
religious,
a
professor
of
religion
what
some
would
call
"a
saint;"
and
she
referred
to
religion
often
in
sanctioned
phrase
in
phrase
which
those
who
possess
a
perception
of
the
ridiculous,
without
owning
the
power
of
exactly
testing
and
truly
judging
character,
would
certainly
have
esteemed
a
proper
subject
for
satire,
a
matter
for
mimicry
and
laughter.
They
would
have
been
hugely
mistaken
for
their
pains.
Sincerity
is
never
ludicrous;
it
is
always
respectable.
Whether
truth
be
it
religious
or
moral
truth
speak
eloquently
and
in
well
chosen
language
or
not,
its
voice
should
be
heard
with
reverence.
Let
those
who
cannot
nicely,
and
with
certainty,
discern
the
difference
between
the
tones
of
hypocrisy
and
those
of
sincerity,
never
presume
to
laugh
at
all,
lest
they
should
have
the
miserable
misfortune
to
laugh
in
the
wrong
place,
and
commit
impiety
when
they
think
they
are
achieving
wit.
Not
from
Miss
Ainley's
own
lips
did
Caroline
hear
of
her
good
works,
but
she
knew
much
of
them
nevertheless.
Her
beneficence
was
the
familiar
topic
of
the
poor
in
Briarfield.
They
were
not
works
of
almsgiving.
The
old
maid
was
too
poor
to
give
much,
though
she
straitened
herself
to
privation
that
she
might
contribute
her
mite
when
needful.
They
were
the
works
of
a
Sister
of
Charity
far
more
difficult
to
perform
than
those
of
a
Lady
Bountiful.
She
would
watch
by
any
sick
bed;
she
seemed
to
fear
no
disease.
She
would
nurse
the
poorest
whom
none
else
would
nurse.
She
was
serene,
humble,
kind,
and
equable
through
everything.
For
this
goodness
she
got
but
little
reward
in
this
life.
Many
of
the
poor
became
so
accustomed
to
her
services
that
they
hardly
thanked
her
for
them.
The
rich
heard
them
mentioned
with
wonder,
but
were
silent,
from
a
sense
of
shame
at
the
difference
between
her
sacrifices
and
their
own.
Many
ladies,
however,
respected
her
deeply.
They
could
not
help
it.
One
gentleman
one
only
gave
her
his
friendship
and
perfect
confidence.
This
was
Mr.
Hall,
the
vicar
of
Nunnely.
He
said,
and
said
truly,
that
her
life
came
nearer
the
life
of
