child
why
do
you
not
bear
me
company?
I
only
weep
tears,
delightful
and
soon
wiped
away;
you
might
weep
gall,
if
you
choose."
"Why
should
I
weep
gall?"
"Mateless,
solitary
bird!"
was
the
only
answer.
"And
are
not
you
too
mateless,
Shirley?"
"At
heart
no."
"Oh!
who
nestles
there,
Shirley?"
But
Shirley
only
laughed
gaily
at
this
question,
and
alertly
started
up.
"I
have
dreamed,"
she
said,
"a
mere
day
dream
certainly
bright,
probably
baseless!"
Miss
Helstone
was
by
this
time
free
enough
from
illusions:
she
took
a
sufficiently
grave
view
of
the
future,
and
fancied
she
knew
pretty
well
how
her
own
destiny
and
that
of
some
others
were
tending.
Yet
old
associations
retained
their
influence
over
her,
and
it
was
these
and
the
power
of
habit
which
still
frequently
drew
her
of
an
evening
to
the
field
style
and
the
old
thorn
overlooking
the
Hollow.
One
night,
the
night
after
the
incident
of
the
note,
she
had
been
at
her
usual
post,
watching
for
her
beacon
watching
vainly:
that
evening
no
lamp
was
lit.
She
waited
till
the
rising
of
certain
constellations
warned
her
of
lateness
and
signed
her
away.
In
passing
Fieldhead,
on
her
return,
its
moonlight
beauty
attracted
her
glance,
and
stayed
her
step
an
instant.
Tree
and
hall
rose
peaceful
under
the
night
sky
and
clear
full
orb;
pearly
paleness
gilded
the
building;
mellow
brown
gloom
bosomed
it
round;
shadows
of
deep
green
brooded
above
its
oak
wreathed
roof.
The
broad
pavement
in
front
shone
pale
also;
it
gleamed
as
if
some
spell
had
transformed
the
dark
granite
to
glistering
Parian.
On
the
silvery
space
slept
two
sable
shadows,
thrown
sharply
defined
from
two
human
figures.
These
figures
when
first
seen
were
motionless
and
mute;
presently
they
moved
in
harmonious
step,
and
spoke
low
in
harmonious
key.
Earnest
was
the
gaze
that
scrutinized
them
as
they
emerged
from
behind
the
trunk
of
the
cedar.
"Is
it
Mrs.
Pryor
and
Shirley?"
Certainly
it
is
Shirley.
Who
else
has
a
shape
so
lithe,
and
proud,
and
graceful?
And
her
face,
too,
is
visible
her
countenance
careless
and
pensive,
and
musing
and
mirthful,
and
mocking
and
tender.
Not
fearing
the
dew,
she
has
not
covered
her
head;
her
curls
are
free
they
veil
her
neck
and
caress
her
shoulder
with
their
tendril
rings.
An
ornament
of
gold
gleams
through
the
half
closed
folds
of
the
scarf
she
has
wrapped
across
her
bust,
and
a
large
bright
gem
glitters
on
the
white
hand
which
confines
it.
Yes,
that
is
Shirley.
Her
companion
then
is,
of
course,
Mrs.
Pryor?
Yes,
if
Mrs.
Pryor
owns
six
feet
of
stature,
and
if
she
has
changed
her
decent
widow's
weeds
for
masculine
disguise.
The
figure
walking
at
Miss
Keeldar's
side
is
a
man
a
tall,
young,
stately
man;
it
is
her
tenant,
Robert
Moore.
The
pair
speak
softly;
their
words
are
not
distinguishable.
To
remain
a
moment
to
gaze
is
not
to
be
an
eavesdropper;
and
as
the
moon
shines
so
clearly
