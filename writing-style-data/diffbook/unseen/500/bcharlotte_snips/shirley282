of
the
banisters,
whence
she
could
make
further
observations
ere
presenting
herself.
It
was
considerably
past
sunset
now;
dusk
filled
the
passage,
yet
not
such
deep
dusk
but
that
she
could
presently
see
Robert
and
Hortense
traverse
it.
"Caroline!
Caroline!"
called
Hortense,
a
moment
afterwards,
"venez
voir
mon
frere!"
"Strange,"
commented
Miss
Helstone,
"passing
strange!
What
does
this
unwonted
excitement
about
such
an
every
day
occurrence
as
a
return
from
market
portend?
She
has
not
lost
her
senses,
has
she?
Surely
the
burnt
treacle
has
not
crazed
her?"
She
descended
in
a
subdued
flutter.
Yet
more
was
she
fluttered
when
Hortense
seized
her
hand
at
the
parlour
door,
and
leading
her
to
Robert,
who
stood
in
bodily
presence,
tall
and
dark
against
the
one
window,
presented
her
with
a
mixture
of
agitation
and
formality,
as
though
they
had
been
utter
strangers,
and
this
was
their
first
mutual
introduction.
Increasing
puzzle!
He
bowed
rather
awkwardly,
and
turning
from
her
with
a
stranger's
embarrassment,
he
met
the
doubtful
light
from
the
window.
It
fell
on
his
face,
and
the
enigma
of
the
dream
(a
dream
it
seemed)
was
at
its
height.
She
saw
a
visage
like
and
unlike
Robert,
and
no
Robert.
"What
is
the
matter?"
said
Caroline.
"Is
my
sight
wrong?
Is
it
my
cousin?"
"Certainly
it
is
your
cousin,"
asserted
Hortense.
Then
who
was
this
now
coming
through
the
passage
now
entering
the
room?
Caroline,
looking
round,
met
a
new
Robert
the
real
Robert,
as
she
felt
at
once.
"Well,"
said
he,
smiling
at
her
questioning,
astonished
face,
"which
is
which?"
"Ah,
this
is
you!"
was
the
answer.
He
laughed.
"I
believe
it
is
me.
And
do
you
know
who
he
is?
You
never
saw
him
before,
but
you
have
heard
of
him."
She
had
gathered
her
senses
now.
"It
can
be
only
one
person
your
brother,
since
it
is
so
like
you;
my
other
cousin,
Louis."
"Clever
little
eadipus!
you
would
have
baffled
the
Sphinx!
But
now,
see
us
together.
Change
places;
change
again,
to
confuse
her,
Louis.
Which
is
the
old
love
now,
Lina?"
"As
if
it
were
possible
to
make
a
mistake
when
you
speak!
You
should
have
told
Hortense
to
ask.
But
you
are
not
so
much
alike.
It
is
only
your
height,
your
figure,
and
complexion
that
are
so
similar."
"And
I
am
Robert,
am
I
not?"
asked
the
newcomer,
making
a
first
effort
to
overcome
what
seemed
his
natural
shyness.
Caroline
shook
her
head
gently.
A
soft,
expressive
ray
from
her
eye
beamed
on
the
real
Robert.
It
said
much.
She
was
not
permitted
to
quit
her
cousins
soon.
Robert
himself
was
peremptory
in
obliging
her
to
remain.
Glad,
simple,
and
affable
in
her
demeanour
(glad
for
this
night,
at
least),
in
light,
bright
spirits
for
the
time,
she
was
too
pleasant
an
addition
to
the
cottage
circle
to
be
willingly
parted
with
by
any
of
them.
Louis
seemed
naturally
rather
a
grave,
still,
retiring
man;
but
the
Caroline
of
this
evening,
which
was
