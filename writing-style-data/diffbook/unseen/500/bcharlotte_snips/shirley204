for
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
the
speaker's
mouth
when
Peter
Augustus
came
up,
all
in
grande
tenue,
gloved
and
scented,
with
his
hair
oiled
and
brushed
to
perfection,
and
bearing
in
one
hand
a
huge
bunch
of
cabbage
roses,
five
or
six
in
full
blow.
These
he
presented
to
the
heiress
with
a
grace
to
which
the
most
cunning
pencil
could
do
but
defective
justice.
And
who,
after
this,
could
dare
to
say
that
Peter
was
not
a
lady's
man?
He
had
gathered
and
he
had
given
flowers;
he
had
offered
a
sentimental,
a
poetic
tribute
at
the
shrine
of
Love
or
Mammon.
Hercules
holding
the
distaff
was
but
a
faint
type
of
Peter
bearing
the
roses.
He
must
have
thought
this
himself,
for
he
seemed
amazed
at
what
he
had
done.
He
backed
without
a
word;
he
was
going
away
with
a
husky
chuckle
of
self
satisfaction;
then
he
bethought
himself
to
stop
and
turn,
to
ascertain
by
ocular
testimony
that
he
really
had
presented
a
bouquet.
Yes,
there
were
the
six
red
cabbages
on
the
purple
satin
lap,
a
very
white
hand,
with
some
gold
rings
on
the
fingers,
slightly
holding
them
together,
and
streaming
ringlets,
half
hiding
a
laughing
face,
drooped
over
them.
Only
half
hiding!
Peter
saw
the
laugh;
it
was
unmistakable.
He
was
made
a
joke
of;
his
gallantry,
his
chivalry,
were
the
subject
of
a
jest
for
a
petticoat
for
two
petticoats:
Miss
Helstone
too
was
smiling.
Moreover,
he
felt
he
was
seen
through,
and
Peter
grew
black
as
a
thunder
cloud.
When
Shirley
looked
up,
a
fell
eye
was
fastened
on
her.
Malone,
at
least,
had
energy
enough
in
hate.
She
saw
it
in
his
glance.
"Peter
is
worth
a
scene,
and
shall
have
it,
if
he
likes,
one
day,"
she
whispered
to
her
friend.
And
now
solemn
and
sombre
as
to
their
colour,
though
bland
enough
as
to
their
faces
appeared
at
the
dining
room
door
the
three
rectors.
They
had
hitherto
been
busy
in
the
church,
and
were
now
coming
to
take
some
little
refreshment
for
the
body,
ere
the
march
commenced.
The
large
morocco
covered
easy
chair
had
been
left
vacant
for
Dr.
Boultby.
He
was
put
into
it,
and
Caroline,
obeying
the
instigations
of
Shirley,
who
told
her
now
was
the
time
to
play
the
hostess,
hastened
to
hand
to
her
uncle's
vast,
revered,
and,
on
the
whole,
worthy
friend,
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
plate
of
macaroons.
Boultby's
churchwardens,
patrons
of
the
Sunday
school
both,
as
he
insisted
on
their
being,
were
already
beside
him;
Mrs.
Sykes
and
the
other
ladies
of
his
congregation
were
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left,
expressing
their
hopes
that
he
was
not
fatigued,
their
fears
that
the
day
would
be
too
warm
for
him.
Mrs.
Boultby,
who
held
an
opinion
that
when
her
lord
dropped
asleep
after
a
good
dinner
his
face
became
as
the
face
of
an
angel,
was
bending
over
him,
tenderly
wiping
some
perspiration,
