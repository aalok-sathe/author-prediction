Mrs.
Helstone,
inverting
the
natural
order
of
insect
existence,
would
have
fluttered
through
the
honeymoon
a
bright,
admired
butterfly,
and
crawled
the
rest
of
her
days
a
sordid,
trampled
worm.
Little
Mr.
Sweeting,
seated
between
Mrs.
Sykes
and
Miss
Mary,
both
of
whom
were
very
kind
to
him,
and
having
a
dish
of
tarts
before
him,
and
marmalade
and
crumpet
upon
his
plate,
looked
and
felt
more
content
than
any
monarch.
He
was
fond
of
all
the
Misses
Sykes;
they
were
all
fond
of
him.
He
thought
them
magnificent
girls,
quite
proper
to
mate
with
one
of
his
inches.
If
he
had
a
cause
of
regret
at
this
blissful
moment,
it
was
that
Miss
Dora
happened
to
be
absent
Dora
being
the
one
whom
he
secretly
hoped
one
day
to
call
Mrs.
David
Sweeting,
with
whom
he
dreamt
of
taking
stately
walks,
leading
her
like
an
empress
through
the
village
of
Nunnely;
and
an
empress
she
would
have
been,
if
size
could
make
an
empress.
She
was
vast,
ponderous.
Seen
from
behind,
she
had
the
air
of
a
very
stout
lady
of
forty;
but
withal
she
possessed
a
good
face,
and
no
unkindly
character.
The
meal
at
last
drew
to
a
close.
It
would
have
been
over
long
ago
if
Mr.
Donne
had
not
persisted
in
sitting
with
his
cup
half
full
of
cold
tea
before
him,
long
after
the
rest
had
finished
and
after
he
himself
had
discussed
such
allowance
of
viands
as
he
felt
competent
to
swallow
long,
indeed,
after
signs
of
impatience
had
been
manifested
all
round
the
board,
till
chairs
were
pushed
back,
till
the
talk
flagged,
till
silence
fell.
Vainly
did
Caroline
inquire
repeatedly
if
he
would
have
another
cup,
if
he
would
take
a
little
hot
tea,
as
that
must
be
cold,
etc.;
he
would
neither
drink
it
nor
leave
it.
He
seemed
to
think
that
this
isolated
position
of
his
gave
him
somehow
a
certain
importance,
that
it
was
dignified
and
stately
to
be
the
last,
that
it
was
grand
to
keep
all
the
others
waiting.
So
long
did
he
linger,
that
the
very
urn
died;
it
ceased
to
hiss.
At
length,
however,
the
old
rector
himself,
who
had
hitherto
been
too
pleasantly
engaged
with
Hannah
to
care
for
the
delay,
got
impatient.
"For
whom
are
we
waiting?"
he
asked.
"For
me,
I
believe,"
returned
Donne
complacently,
appearing
to
think
it
much
to
his
credit
that
a
party
should
thus
be
kept
dependent
on
his
movements.
"Tut!"
cried
Helstone.
Then
standing
up,
"Let
us
return
thanks,"
said
he;
which
he
did
forthwith,
and
all
quitted
the
table.
Donne,
nothing
abashed,
still
sat
ten
minutes
quite
alone,
whereupon
Mr.
Helstone
rang
the
bell
for
the
things
to
be
removed.
The
curate
at
length
saw
himself
forced
to
empty
his
cup,
and
to
relinquish
the
role
which,
he
thought,
had
given
him
such
a
felicitous
distinction,
drawing
upon
him
such
flattering
general
notice.
And
now,
in
the
natural
course
of
events
(Caroline,
knowing
how
