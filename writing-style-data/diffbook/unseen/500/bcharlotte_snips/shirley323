Moore
had
perhaps
caught
the
fever,
which
for
a
few
days
laid
him
low,
in
one
of
the
poor
cottages
of
the
district,
which
he,
his
lame
pupil,
and
Mr.
Hall
were
in
the
habit
of
visiting
together.
At
any
rate
he
sickened,
and
after
opposing
to
the
malady
a
taciturn
resistance
for
a
day
or
two,
was
obliged
to
keep
his
chamber.
He
lay
tossing
on
his
thorny
bed
one
evening,
Henry,
who
would
not
quit
him,
watching
faithfully
beside
him,
when
a
tap
too
light
to
be
that
of
Mrs.
Gill
or
the
housemaid
summoned
young
Sympson
to
the
door.
"How
is
Mr.
Moore
to
night?"
asked
a
low
voice
from
the
dark
gallery.
"Come
in
and
see
him
yourself."
"Is
he
asleep?"
"I
wish
he
could
sleep.
Come
and
speak
to
him,
Shirley."
"He
would
not
like
it."
But
the
speaker
stepped
in,
and
Henry,
seeing
her
hesitate
on
the
threshold,
took
her
hand
and
drew
her
to
the
couch.
The
shaded
light
showed
Miss
Keeldar's
form
but
imperfectly;
yet
it
revealed
her
in
elegant
attire.
There
was
a
party
assembled
below,
including
Sir
Philip
Nunnely;
the
ladies
were
now
in
the
drawing
room,
and
their
hostess
had
stolen
from
them
to
visit
Henry's
tutor.
Her
pure
white
dress,
her
fair
arms
and
neck,
the
trembling
chainlet
of
gold
circling
her
throat
and
quivering
on
her
breast,
glistened
strangely
amid
the
obscurity
of
the
sickroom.
Her
mien
was
chastened
and
pensive.
She
spoke
gently.
"Mr.
Moore,
how
are
you
to
night?"
"I
have
not
been
very
ill,
and
am
now
better."
"I
heard
that
you
complained
of
thirst.
I
have
brought
you
some
grapes;
can
you
taste
one?"
"No;
but
I
thank
you
for
remembering
me."
"Just
one."
From
the
rich
cluster
that
filled
a
small
basket
held
in
her
hand
she
severed
a
berry
and
offered
it
to
his
lips.
He
shook
his
head,
and
turned
aside
his
flushed
face.
"But
what,
then,
can
I
bring
you
instead?
You
have
no
wish
for
fruit;
yet
I
see
that
your
lips
are
parched.
What
beverage
do
you
prefer?"
"Mrs.
Gill
supplies
me
with
toast
and
water.
I
like
it
best."
Silence
fell
for
some
minutes.
"Do
you
suffer?
have
you
pain?"
"Very
little."
"What
made
you
ill?"
Silence.
"I
wonder
what
caused
this
fever?
To
what
do
you
attribute
it?"
"Miasma,
perhaps
malaria.
This
is
autumn,
a
season
fertile
in
fevers."
"I
hear
you
often
visit
the
sick
in
Briarfield,
and
Nunnely
too,
with
Mr.
Hall.
You
should
be
on
your
guard;
temerity
is
not
wise."
"That
reminds
me,
Miss
Keeldar,
that
perhaps
you
had
better
not
enter
this
chamber
or
come
near
this
couch.
I
do
not
believe
my
illness
is
infectious.
I
scarcely
fear"
with
a
sort
of
smile
"you
will
take
it;
but
why
should
you
run
even
the
shadow
of
a
risk?
Leave
me."
"Patience,
I
will
go
soon;
but
I
should
like
to
do
something
for
you
before
I
depart
any
little
