dare
you
expect
me
to
say?'
"'What
I
am
dying
and
perishing
to
hear;
what
I
must
and
will
hear;
what
you
dare
not
now
suppress.'
"'Mr.
Moore,
I
hardly
know
what
you
mean.
You
are
not
like
yourself.'
"I
suppose
I
hardly
was
like
my
usual
self,
for
I
scared
her
that
I
could
see.
It
was
right:
she
must
be
scared
to
be
won.
"'You
do
know
what
I
mean,
and
for
the
first
time
I
stand
before
you
myself.
I
have
flung
off
the
tutor,
and
beg
to
introduce
you
to
the
man.
And
remember,
he
is
a
gentleman.'
"She
trembled.
She
put
her
hand
to
mine
as
if
to
remove
it
from
the
lock.
She
might
as
well
have
tried
to
loosen,
by
her
soft
touch,
metal
welded
to
metal.
She
felt
she
was
powerless,
and
receded;
and
again
she
trembled.
"What
change
I
underwent
I
cannot
explain,
but
out
of
her
emotion
passed
into
me
a
new
spirit.
I
neither
was
crushed
nor
elated
by
her
lands
and
gold;
I
thought
not
of
them,
cared
not
for
them.
They
were
nothing
dross
that
could
not
dismay
me.
I
saw
only
herself
her
young
beautiful
form,
the
grace,
the
majesty,
the
modesty
of
her
girlhood.
"'My
pupil,'
I
said.
"'My
master,'
was
the
low
answer.
"'I
have
a
thing
to
tell
you.'
"She
waited
with
declined
brow
and
ringlets
drooped.
"'I
have
to
tell
you
that
for
four
years
you
have
been
growing
into
your
tutor's
heart,
and
that
you
are
rooted
there
now.
I
have
to
declare
that
you
have
bewitched
me,
in
spite
of
sense,
and
experience,
and
difference
of
station
and
estate.
You
have
so
looked,
and
spoken,
and
moved;
so
shown
me
your
faults
and
your
virtues
beauties
rather,
they
are
hardly
so
stern
as
virtues
that
I
love
you
love
you
with
my
life
and
strength.
It
is
out
now.'
"She
sought
what
to
say,
but
could
not
find
a
word.
She
tried
to
rally,
but
vainly.
I
passionately
repeated
that
I
loved
her.
"'Well,
Mr.
Moore,
what
then?'
was
the
answer
I
got,
uttered
in
a
tone
that
would
have
been
petulant
if
it
had
not
faltered.
"'Have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me?
Have
you
no
love
for
me?'
"'A
little
bit.'
"'I
am
not
to
be
tortured.
I
will
not
even
play
at
present.'
"'I
don't
want
to
play;
I
want
to
go.'
"'I
wonder
you
dare
speak
of
going
at
this
moment.
You
go!
What!
with
my
heart
in
your
hand,
to
lay
it
on
your
toilet
and
pierce
it
with
your
pins?
From
my
presence
you
do
not
stir,
out
of
my
reach
you
do
not
stray,
till
I
receive
a
hostage
pledge
for
pledge
your
heart
for
mine.'
"'The
thing
you
want
is
mislaid
lost
some
time
since.
Let
me
go
and
seek
it.'
"'Declare
that
it
is
where
your
keys
often
are
in
my
possession.'
"'You
ought
to
know.
And
where
are
my
keys,
