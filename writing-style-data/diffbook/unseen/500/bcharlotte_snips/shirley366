are
a
little
altered.
While
I
was
in
Birmingham
I
looked
a
little
into
reality,
considered
closely
and
at
their
source
the
causes
of
the
present
troubles
of
this
country.
I
did
the
same
in
London.
Unknown,
I
could
go
where
I
pleased,
mix
with
whom
I
would.
I
went
where
there
was
want
of
food,
of
fuel,
of
clothing;
where
there
was
no
occupation
and
no
hope.
I
saw
some,
with
naturally
elevated
tendencies
and
good
feelings,
kept
down
amongst
sordid
privations
and
harassing
griefs.
I
saw
many
originally
low,
and
to
whom
lack
of
education
left
scarcely
anything
but
animal
wants,
disappointed
in
those
wants,
ahungered,
athirst,
and
desperate
as
famished
animals.
I
saw
what
taught
my
brain
a
new
lesson,
and
filled
my
breast
with
fresh
feelings.
I
have
no
intention
to
profess
more
softness
or
sentiment
than
I
have
hitherto
professed;
mutiny
and
ambition
I
regard
as
I
have
always
regarded
them.
I
should
resist
a
riotous
mob
just
as
heretofore;
I
should
open
on
the
scent
of
a
runaway
ringleader
as
eagerly
as
ever,
and
run
him
down
as
relentlessly,
and
follow
him
up
to
condign
punishment
as
rigorously;
but
I
should
do
it
now
chiefly
for
the
sake
and
the
security
of
those
he
misled.
Something
there
is
to
look
to,
Yorke,
beyond
a
man's
personal
interest,
beyond
the
advancement
of
well
laid
schemes,
beyond
even
the
discharge
of
dishonouring
debts.
To
respect
himself,
a
man
must
believe
he
renders
justice
to
his
fellow
men.
Unless
I
am
more
considerate
to
ignorance,
more
forbearing
to
suffering,
than
I
have
hitherto
been,
I
shall
scorn
myself
as
grossly
unjust.
What
now?"
he
said,
addressing
his
horse,
which,
hearing
the
ripple
of
water,
and
feeling
thirsty,
turned
to
a
wayside
trough,
where
the
moonbeam
was
playing
in
a
crystal
eddy.
"Yorke,"
pursued
Moore,
"ride
on;
I
must
let
him
drink."
Yorke
accordingly
rode
slowly
forwards,
occupying
himself
as
he
advanced
in
discriminating,
amongst
the
many
lights
now
spangling
the
distance,
those
of
Briarmains.
Stilbro'
Moor
was
left
behind;
plantations
rose
dusk
on
either
hand;
they
were
descending
the
hill;
below
them
lay
the
valley
with
its
populous
parish:
they
felt
already
at
home.
Surrounded
no
longer
by
heath,
it
was
not
startling
to
Mr.
Yorke
to
see
a
hat
rise,
and
to
hear
a
voice
speak
behind
the
wall.
The
words,
however,
were
peculiar.
"When
the
wicked
perisheth
there
is
shouting,"
it
said;
and
added,
"As
the
whirlwind
passeth,
so
is
the
wicked
no
more"
(with
a
deeper
growl):
"terrors
take
hold
of
him
as
waters;
hell
is
naked
before
him.
He
shall
die
without
knowledge."
A
fierce
flash
and
sharp
crack
violated
the
calm
of
night.
Yorke,
ere
he
turned,
knew
the
four
convicts
of
Birmingham
were
avenged.
The
die
was
cast.
Sir
Philip
Nunnely
knew
it;
Shirley
knew
it;
Mr.
Sympson
knew
it.
That
evening,
when
all
the
Fieldhead
family
dined
at
Nunnely
Priory,
decided
the
business.
Two
or
three
things
conduced
to
bring
