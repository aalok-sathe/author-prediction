and
on
the
hill
top
noticed
that
instead
of
turning
on
Rushedge,
the
top
ridge
of
Stilbro'
Moor,
she
rode
forwards
all
the
way
to
the
town.
Scouts
were
not
wanting
to
mark
her
destination
there.
It
was
ascertained
that
she
alighted
at
the
door
of
one
Mr.
Pearson
Hall,
a
solicitor,
related
to
the
vicar
of
Nunnely.
This
gentleman
and
his
ancestors
had
been
the
agents
of
the
Keeldar
family
for
generations
back.
Some
people
affirmed
that
Miss
Keeldar
was
become
involved
in
business
speculations
connected
with
Hollow's
Mill
that
she
had
lost
money,
and
was
constrained
to
mortgage
her
land.
Others
conjectured
that
she
was
going
to
be
married,
and
that
the
settlements
were
preparing.
Mr.
Moore
and
Henry
Sympson
were
together
in
the
schoolroom.
The
tutor
was
waiting
for
a
lesson
which
the
pupil
seemed
busy
in
preparing.
"Henry,
make
haste.
The
afternoon
is
getting
on."
"Is
it,
sir?"
"Certainly.
Are
you
nearly
ready
with
that
lesson?"
"No."
"Not
nearly
ready?"
"I
have
not
construed
a
line."
Mr.
Moore
looked
up.
The
boy's
tone
was
rather
peculiar.
"The
task
presents
no
difficulties,
Henry;
or,
if
it
does,
bring
them
to
me.
We
will
work
together."
"Mr.
Moore,
I
can
do
no
work."
"My
boy,
you
are
ill."
"Sir,
I
am
not
worse
in
bodily
health
than
usual,
but
my
heart
is
full."
"Shut
the
book.
Come
hither,
Harry.
Come
to
the
fireside."
Harry
limped
forward.
His
tutor
placed
him
in
a
chair;
his
lips
were
quivering,
his
eyes
brimming.
He
laid
his
crutch
on
the
floor,
bent
down
his
head,
and
wept.
"This
distress
is
not
occasioned
by
physical
pain,
you
say,
Harry?
You
have
a
grief;
tell
it
me."
"Sir,
I
have
such
a
grief
as
I
never
had
before.
I
wish
it
could
be
relieved
in
some
way;
I
can
hardly
bear
it."
"Who
knows
but,
if
we
talk
it
over,
we
may
relieve
it?
What
is
the
cause?
Whom
does
it
concern?"
"The
cause,
sir,
is
Shirley;
it
concerns
Shirley."
"Does
it?
You
think
her
changed?"
"All
who
know
her
think
her
changed
you
too,
Mr.
Moore."
"Not
seriously
no.
I
see
no
alteration
but
such
as
a
favourable
turn
might
repair
in
a
few
weeks;
besides,
her
own
word
must
go
for
something:
she
says
she
is
well."
"There
it
is,
sir.
As
long
as
she
maintained
she
was
well,
I
believed
her.
When
I
was
sad
out
of
her
sight,
I
soon
recovered
spirits
in
her
presence.
Now
"
"Well,
Harry,
now.
Has
she
said
anything
to
you?
You
and
she
were
together
in
the
garden
two
hours
this
morning.
I
saw
her
talking,
and
you
listening.
Now,
my
dear
Harry,
if
Miss
Keeldar
has
said
she
is
ill,
and
enjoined
you
to
keep
her
secret,
do
not
obey
her.
For
her
life's
sake,
avow
everything.
Speak,
my
boy."
"She
say
she
is
ill!
I
believe,
sir,
if
she
were
dying,
she
would
smile,
and
aver,
'Nothing
ails
me.'"
"What
have
you
