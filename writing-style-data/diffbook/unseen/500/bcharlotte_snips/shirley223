their
disgrace,
not
his.
Mr.
Moore
himself
hates
nobody.
He
only
wants
to
do
his
duty,
and
maintain
his
rights.
You
are
wrong
to
talk
so."
"I
talk
as
I
think.
He
has
a
cold,
unfeeling
heart,
yond'
Moore."
"But,"
interposed
Shirley,
"supposing
Moore
was
driven
from
the
country,
and
his
mill
razed
to
the
ground,
would
people
have
more
work?"
"They'd
have
less.
I
know
that,
and
they
know
that;
and
there
is
many
an
honest
lad
driven
desperate
by
the
certainty
that
whichever
way
he
turns
he
cannot
better
himself;
and
there
is
dishonest
men
plenty
to
guide
them
to
the
devil,
scoundrels
that
reckons
to
be
the
'people's
friends,'
and
that
knows
nought
about
the
people,
and
is
as
insincere
as
Lucifer.
I've
lived
aboon
forty
year
in
the
world,
and
I
believe
that
'the
people'
will
never
have
any
true
friends
but
theirseln
and
them
two
or
three
good
folk
i'
different
stations
that
is
friends
to
all
the
world.
Human
natur',
taking
it
i'
th'
lump,
is
nought
but
selfishness.
It
is
but
excessive
few,
it
is
but
just
an
exception
here
and
there,
now
and
then,
sich
as
ye
two
young
uns
and
me,
that,
being
in
a
different
sphere,
can
understand
t'
one
t'
other,
and
be
friends
wi'out
slavishness
o'
one
hand
or
pride
o'
t'
other.
Them
that
reckons
to
be
friends
to
a
lower
class
than
their
own
fro'
political
motives
is
never
to
be
trusted;
they
always
try
to
make
their
inferiors
tools.
For
my
own
part,
I
will
neither
be
patronized
nor
misled
for
no
man's
pleasure.
I've
had
overtures
made
to
me
lately
that
I
saw
were
treacherous,
and
I
flung
'em
back
i'
the
faces
o'
them
that
offered
'em."
"You
won't
tell
us
what
overtures?"
"I
will
not.
It
would
do
no
good.
It
would
mak
no
difference.
Them
they
concerned
can
look
after
theirseln."
"Ay,
we'se
look
after
werseln,"
said
another
voice.
Joe
Scott
had
sauntered
forth
from
the
church
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air,
and
there
he
stood.
"I'll
warrant
ye,
Joe,"
observed
William,
smiling.
"And
I'll
warrant
my
maister,"
was
the
answer.
"Young
ladies,"
continued
Joe,
assuming
a
lordly
air,
"ye'd
better
go
into
th'
house."
"I
wonder
what
for?"
inquired
Shirley,
to
whom
the
overlooker's
somewhat
pragmatical
manners
were
familiar,
and
who
was
often
at
war
with
him;
for
Joe,
holding
supercilious
theories
about
women
in
general,
resented
greatly,
in
his
secret
soul,
the
fact
of
his
master
and
his
master's
mill
being,
in
a
manner,
under
petticoat
government,
and
had
felt
as
wormwood
and
gall
certain
business
visits
of
the
heiress
to
the
Hollow's
counting
house.
"Because
there
is
nought
agate
that
fits
women
to
be
consarned
in."
"Indeed!
There
is
prayer
and
preaching
agate
in
that
church.
Are
we
not
concerned
in
that?"
"Ye
have
been
present
neither
at
the
prayer
nor
preaching,
ma'am,
if
I
have
observed
aright.
What
I
alluded
to
was
politics.
