fresh
faced
servant
opened
it.
By
the
candle
she
held
was
revealed
a
narrow
passage,
terminating
in
a
narrow
stair.
Two
doors
covered
with
crimson
baize,
a
strip
of
crimson
carpet
down
the
steps,
contrasted
with
light
coloured
walls
and
white
floor,
made
the
little
interior
look
clean
and
fresh.
"Mr.
Moore
is
at
home,
I
suppose?"
"Yes,
sir,
but
he
is
not
in."
"Not
in!
Where
is
he
then?"
"At
the
mill
in
the
counting
house."
Here
one
of
the
crimson
doors
opened.
"Are
the
wagons
come,
Sarah?"
asked
a
female
voice,
and
a
female
head
at
the
same
time
was
apparent.
It
might
not
be
the
head
of
a
goddess
indeed
a
screw
of
curl
paper
on
each
side
the
temples
quite
forbade
that
supposition
but
neither
was
it
the
head
of
a
Gorgon;
yet
Malone
seemed
to
take
it
in
the
latter
light.
Big
as
he
was,
he
shrank
bashfully
back
into
the
rain
at
the
view
thereof,
and
saying,
"I'll
go
to
him,"
hurried
in
seeming
trepidation
down
a
short
lane,
across
an
obscure
yard,
towards
a
huge
black
mill.
The
work
hours
were
over;
the
"hands"
were
gone.
The
machinery
was
at
rest,
the
mill
shut
up.
Malone
walked
round
it.
Somewhere
in
its
great
sooty
flank
he
found
another
chink
of
light;
he
knocked
at
another
door,
using
for
the
purpose
the
thick
end
of
his
shillelah,
with
which
he
beat
a
rousing
tattoo.
A
key
turned;
the
door
unclosed.
"Is
it
Joe
Scott?
What
news
of
the
wagons,
Joe?"
"No;
it's
myself.
Mr.
Helstone
would
send
me."
"Oh!
Mr.
Malone."
The
voice
in
uttering
this
name
had
the
slightest
possible
cadence
of
disappointment.
After
a
moment's
pause
it
continued,
politely
but
a
little
formally,
"I
beg
you
will
come
in,
Mr.
Malone.
I
regret
extremely
Mr.
Helstone
should
have
thought
it
necessary
to
trouble
you
so
far.
There
was
no
necessity
I
told
him
so
and
on
such
a
night;
but
walk
forwards."
Through
a
dark
apartment,
of
aspect
undistinguishable,
Malone
followed
the
speaker
into
a
light
and
bright
room
within
very
light
and
bright
indeed
it
seemed
to
eyes
which,
for
the
last
hour,
had
been
striving
to
penetrate
the
double
darkness
of
night
and
fog;
but
except
for
its
excellent
fire,
and
for
a
lamp
of
elegant
design
and
vivid
lustre
burning
on
a
table,
it
was
a
very
plain
place.
The
boarded
floor
was
carpetless;
the
three
or
four
stiff
backed,
green
painted
chairs
seemed
once
to
have
furnished
the
kitchen
of
some
farm
house;
a
desk
of
strong,
solid
formation,
the
table
aforesaid,
and
some
framed
sheets
on
the
stone
coloured
walls,
bearing
plans
for
building,
for
gardening,
designs
of
machinery,
etc.,
completed
the
furniture
of
the
place.
Plain
as
it
was,
it
seemed
to
satisfy
Malone,
who,
when
he
had
removed
and
hung
up
his
wet
surtout
and
hat,
drew
one
of
the
rheumatic
looking
chairs
to
the
hearth,
and
set
his
knees
almost
within
the
bars
of
