When
others
uttered
it
she
changed
countenance
I
know
she
did.
She
pronounced
it
herself
in
the
most
musical
of
her
many
musical
tones.
She
was
cordial
to
me;
she
took
an
interest
in
me;
she
was
anxious
about
me;
she
wished
me
well;
she
sought,
she
seized
every
opportunity
to
benefit
me.
I
considered,
paused,
watched,
weighed,
wondered.
I
could
come
to
but
one
conclusion
this
is
love.
"I
looked
at
her,
Yorke.
I
saw
in
her
youth
and
a
species
of
beauty.
I
saw
power
in
her.
Her
wealth
offered
me
the
redemption
of
my
honour
and
my
standing.
I
owed
her
gratitude.
She
had
aided
me
substantially
and
effectually
by
a
loan
of
five
thousand
pounds.
Could
I
remember
these
things?
Could
I
believe
she
loved
me?
Could
I
hear
wisdom
urge
me
to
marry
her,
and
disregard
every
dear
advantage,
disbelieve
every
flattering
suggestion,
disdain
every
well
weighed
counsel,
turn
and
leave
her?
Young,
graceful,
gracious
my
benefactress,
attached
to
me,
enamoured
of
me.
I
used
to
say
so
to
myself;
dwell
on
the
word;
mouth
it
over
and
over
again;
swell
over
it
with
a
pleasant,
pompous
complacency,
with
an
admiration
dedicated
entirely
to
myself,
and
unimpaired
even
by
esteem
for
her;
indeed
I
smiled
in
deep
secrecy
at
her
naivete
and
simplicity
in
being
the
first
to
love,
and
to
show
it.
That
whip
of
yours
seems
to
have
a
good
heavy
handle,
Yorke;
you
can
swing
it
about
your
head
and
knock
me
out
of
the
saddle,
if
you
choose.
I
should
rather
relish
a
loundering
whack."
"Tak
patience,
Robert,
till
the
moon
rises
and
I
can
see
you.
Speak
plain
out
did
you
love
her
or
not?
I
could
like
to
know.
I
feel
curious."
"Sir
sir
I
say
she
is
very
pretty,
in
her
own
style,
and
very
attractive.
She
has
a
look,
at
times,
of
a
thing
made
out
of
fire
and
air,
at
which
I
stand
and
marvel,
without
a
thought
of
clasping
and
kissing
it.
I
felt
in
her
a
powerful
magnet
to
my
interest
and
vanity.
I
never
felt
as
if
nature
meant
her
to
be
my
other
and
better
self.
When
a
question
on
that
head
rushed
upon
me,
I
flung
it
off,
saying
brutally
I
should
be
rich
with
her
and
ruined
without
her
vowing
I
would
be
practical,
and
not
romantic."
"A
very
sensible
resolve.
What
mischief
came
of
it,
Bob?"
"With
this
sensible
resolve
I
walked
up
to
Fieldhead
one
night
last
August.
It
was
the
very
eve
of
my
departure
for
Birmingham;
for,
you
see,
I
wanted
to
secure
Fortune's
splendid
prize.
I
had
previously
dispatched
a
note
requesting
a
private
interview.
I
found
her
at
home,
and
alone.
"She
received
me
without
embarrassment,
for
she
thought
I
came
on
business.
I
was
embarrassed
enough,
but
determined.
I
hardly
know
how
I
got
the
operation
over;
but
I
went
to
work
in
a
hard,
firm
fashion
frightful
enough,
I
dare
say.
I
