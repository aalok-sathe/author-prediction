appreciation
of
their
elegance
and
youth.
Before
gentlemen
such
as
Moore
or
Helstone,
for
instance
William
was
often
a
little
dogged;
with
proud
or
insolent
ladies,
too,
he
was
quite
unmanageable,
sometimes
very
resentful;
but
he
was
most
sensible
of,
most
tractable
to,
good
humour
and
civility.
His
nature
a
stubborn
one
was
repelled
by
inflexibility
in
other
natures;
for
which
reason
he
had
never
been
able
to
like
his
former
master,
Moore;
and
unconscious
of
that
gentleman's
good
opinion
of
himself,
and
of
the
service
he
had
secretly
rendered
him
in
recommending
him
as
gardener
to
Mr.
Yorke,
and
by
this
means
to
other
families
in
the
neighbourhood,
he
continued
to
harbour
a
grudge
against
his
austerity.
Latterly
he
had
often
worked
at
Fieldhead.
Miss
Keeldar's
frank,
hospitable
manners
were
perfectly
charming
to
him.
Caroline
he
had
known
from
her
childhood;
unconsciously
she
was
his
ideal
of
a
lady.
Her
gentle
mien,
step,
gestures,
her
grace
of
person
and
attire,
moved
some
artist
fibres
about
his
peasant
heart.
He
had
a
pleasure
in
looking
at
her,
as
he
had
in
examining
rare
flowers
or
in
seeing
pleasant
landscapes.
Both
the
ladies
liked
William;
it
was
their
delight
to
lend
him
books,
to
give
him
plants;
and
they
preferred
his
conversation
far
before
that
of
many
coarse,
hard,
pretentious
people
immeasurably
higher
in
station.
"Who
was
speaking,
William,
when
you
came
out?"
asked
Shirley.
"A
gentleman
ye
set
a
deal
of
store
on,
Miss
Shirley
Mr.
Donne."
"You
look
knowing,
William.
How
did
you
find
out
my
regard
for
Mr.
Donne?"
"Ay,
Miss
Shirley,
there's
a
gleg
light
i'
your
een
sometimes
which
betrays
you.
You
look
raight
down
scornful
sometimes
when
Mr.
Donne
is
by."
"Do
you
like
him
yourself,
William?"
"Me?
I'm
stalled
o'
t'
curates,
and
so
is
t'
wife.
They've
no
manners.
They
talk
to
poor
folk
fair
as
if
they
thought
they
were
beneath
them.
They're
allus
magnifying
their
office.
It
is
a
pity
but
their
office
could
magnify
them;
but
it
does
nought
o'
t'
soart.
I
fair
hate
pride."
"But
you
are
proud
in
your
own
way
yourself,"
interposed
Caroline.
"You
are
what
you
call
house
proud:
you
like
to
have
everything
handsome
about
you.
Sometimes
you
look
as
if
you
were
almost
too
proud
to
take
your
wages.
When
you
were
out
of
work,
you
were
too
proud
to
get
anything
on
credit.
But
for
your
children,
I
believe
you
would
rather
have
starved
than
gone
to
the
shops
without
money;
and
when
I
wanted
to
give
you
something,
what
a
difficulty
I
had
in
making
you
take
it!"
"It
is
partly
true,
Miss
Caroline.
Ony
day
I'd
rather
give
than
take,
especially
from
sich
as
ye.
Look
at
t'
difference
between
us.
Ye're
a
little,
young,
slender
lass,
and
I'm
a
great
strong
man;
I'm
rather
more
nor
twice
your
age.
It
is
not
my
part,
then,
I
think,
to
tak
fro'
ye
to
be
under
obligations
(as
they
say)
to
