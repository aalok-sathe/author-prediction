the
light
upstairs
with
her.
The
window
blind
was
not
drawn,
and
broad
moonbeams
poured
through
the
panes.
There
you
were,
Lina,
at
the
casement,
shrinking
a
little
to
one
side
in
an
attitude
not
unusual
with
you.
You
were
dressed
in
white,
as
I
have
seen
you
dressed
at
an
evening
party.
For
half
a
second
your
fresh,
living
face
seemed
turned
towards
me,
looking
at
me;
for
half
a
second
my
idea
was
to
go
and
take
your
hand,
to
chide
you
for
your
long
absence,
and
welcome
your
present
visit.
Two
steps
forward
broke
the
spell.
The
drapery
of
the
dress
changed
outline;
the
tints
of
the
complexion
dissolved,
and
were
formless.
Positively,
as
I
reached
the
spot,
there
was
nothing
left
but
the
sweep
of
a
white
muslin
curtain,
and
a
balsam
plant
in
a
flower
pot,
covered
with
a
flush
of
bloom.
'Sic
transit,'
et
cetera."
"It
was
not
my
wraith,
then?
I
almost
thought
it
was."
"No;
only
gauze,
crockery,
and
pink
blossom
a
sample
of
earthly
illusions."
"I
wonder
you
have
time
for
such
illusions,
occupied
as
your
mind
must
be."
"So
do
I.
But
I
find
in
myself,
Lina,
two
natures
one
for
the
world
and
business,
and
one
for
home
and
leisure.
Gerard
Moore
is
a
hard
dog,
brought
up
to
mill
and
market;
the
person
you
call
your
cousin
Robert
is
sometimes
a
dreamer,
who
lives
elsewhere
than
in
Cloth
hall
and
counting
house."
"Your
two
natures
agree
with
you.
I
think
you
are
looking
in
good
spirits
and
health.
You
have
quite
lost
that
harassed
air
which
it
often
pained
one
to
see
in
your
face
a
few
months
ago."
"Do
you
observe
that?
Certainly
I
am
disentangled
of
some
difficulties.
I
have
got
clear
of
some
shoals,
and
have
more
sea
room."
"And,
with
a
fair
wind,
you
may
now
hope
to
make
a
prosperous
voyage?"
"I
may
hope
it
yes
but
hope
is
deceptive.
There
is
no
controlling
wind
or
wave.
Gusts
and
swells
perpetually
trouble
the
mariner's
course;
he
dare
not
dismiss
from
his
mind
the
expectation
of
tempest."
"But
you
are
ready
for
a
breeze;
you
are
a
good
seaman,
an
able
commander.
You
are
a
skilful
pilot,
Robert;
you
will
weather
the
storm."
"My
kinswoman
always
thinks
the
best
of
me,
but
I
will
take
her
words
for
a
propitious
omen.
I
will
consider
that
in
meeting
her
to
night
I
have
met
with
one
of
those
birds
whose
appearance
is
to
the
sailor
the
harbinger
of
good
luck."
"A
poor
harbinger
of
good
luck
is
she
who
can
do
nothing,
who
has
no
power.
I
feel
my
incapacity.
It
is
of
no
use
saying
I
have
the
will
to
serve
you
when
I
cannot
prove
it.
Yet
I
have
that
will.
I
wish
you
success.
I
wish
you
high
fortune
and
true
happiness."
"When
did
you
ever
wish
me
anything
else?
What
is
Fanny
waiting
for?
I
told
her
to
walk
on.
Oh!
