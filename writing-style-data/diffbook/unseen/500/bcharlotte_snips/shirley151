nobody
else
had:
she
was
still
such
a
stay,
such
a
counsellor,
so
truthful,
so
kind
in
her
way,
that,
in
Caroline's
idea,
none
once
accustomed
to
her
presence
could
easily
afford
to
dispense
with
it.
As
to
dependency
or
humiliation,
Caroline
did
not
feel
it
in
her
intercourse
with
Shirley,
and
why
should
Mrs.
Pryor?
The
heiress
was
rich
very
rich
compared
with
her
new
friend:
one
possessed
a
clear
thousand
a
year,
the
other
not
a
penny;
and
yet
there
was
a
safe
sense
of
equality
experienced
in
her
society,
never
known
in
that
of
the
ordinary
Briarfield
and
Whinbury
gentry.
The
reason
was,
Shirley's
head
ran
on
other
things
than
money
and
position.
She
was
glad
to
be
independent
as
to
property;
by
fits
she
was
even
elated
at
the
notion
of
being
lady
of
the
manor,
and
having
tenants
and
an
estate.
She
was
especially
tickled
with
an
agreeable
complacency
when
reminded
of
"all
that
property"
down
in
the
Hollow,
"comprising
an
excellent
cloth
mill,
dyehouse,
warehouse,
together
with
the
messuage,
gardens,
and
outbuildings,
termed
Hollow's
Cottage;"
but
her
exultation
being
quite
undisguised
was
singularly
inoffensive;
and,
for
her
serious
thoughts,
they
tended
elsewhere.
To
admire
the
great,
reverence
the
good,
and
be
joyous
with
the
genial,
was
very
much
the
bent
of
Shirley's
soul:
she
mused,
therefore,
on
the
means
of
following
this
bent
far
oftener
than
she
pondered
on
her
social
superiority.
In
Caroline
Miss
Keeldar
had
first
taken
an
interest
because
she
was
quiet,
retiring,
looked
delicate,
and
seemed
as
if
she
needed
some
one
to
take
care
of
her.
Her
predilection
increased
greatly
when
she
discovered
that
her
own
way
of
thinking
and
talking
was
understood
and
responded
to
by
this
new
acquaintance.
She
had
hardly
expected
it.
Miss
Helstone,
she
fancied,
had
too
pretty
a
face,
manners
and
voice
too
soft,
to
be
anything
out
of
the
common
way
in
mind
and
attainments;
and
she
very
much
wondered
to
see
the
gentle
features
light
up
archly
to
the
reveille
of
a
dry
sally
or
two
risked
by
herself;
and
more
did
she
wonder
to
discover
the
self
won
knowledge
treasured,
and
the
untaught
speculations
working
in
that
girlish,
curl
veiled
head.
Caroline's
instinct
of
taste,
too,
was
like
her
own.
Such
books
as
Miss
Keeldar
had
read
with
the
most
pleasure
were
Miss
Helstone's
delight
also.
They
held
many
aversions
too
in
common,
and
could
have
the
comfort
of
laughing
together
over
works
of
false
sentimentality
and
pompous
pretension.
Few,
Shirley
conceived,
men
or
women
have
the
right
taste
in
poetry,
the
right
sense
for
discriminating
between
what
is
real
and
what
is
false.
She
had
again
and
again
heard
very
clever
people
pronounce
this
or
that
passage,
in
this
or
that
versifier,
altogether
admirable,
which,
when
she
read,
her
soul
refused
to
acknowledge
as
anything
but
cant,
flourish,
and
tinsel,
or
at
the
best
elaborate
wordiness,
curious,
clever,
learned,
perhaps,
haply
even
tinged
with
the
fascinating
hues
of
fancy,
but,
