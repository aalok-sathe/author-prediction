squad
you
should
not
have
them."
"I
will
take
care.
You
need
delay
no
longer,
Mr.
Helstone.
You
may
go
now.
He
is
gracious
to
me
to
lend
me
his
pistols,"
she
remarked,
as
the
rector
passed
out
at
the
garden
gate.
"But
come,
Lina,"
she
continued,
"let
us
go
in
and
have
some
supper.
I
was
too
much
vexed
at
tea
with
the
vicinage
of
Mr.
Sam
Wynne
to
be
able
to
eat,
and
now
I
am
really
hungry."
Entering
the
house,
they
repaired
to
the
darkened
dining
room,
through
the
open
windows
of
which
apartment
stole
the
evening
air,
bearing
the
perfume
of
flowers
from
the
garden,
the
very
distant
sound
of
far
retreating
steps
from
the
road,
and
a
soft,
vague
murmur
whose
origin
Caroline
explained
by
the
remark,
uttered
as
she
stood
listening
at
the
casement,
"Shirley,
I
hear
the
beck
in
the
Hollow."
Then
she
rang
the
bell,
asked
for
a
candle
and
some
bread
and
milk
Miss
Keeldar's
usual
supper
and
her
own.
Fanny,
when
she
brought
in
the
tray,
would
have
closed
the
windows
and
the
shutters,
but
was
requested
to
desist
for
the
present.
The
twilight
was
too
calm,
its
breath
too
balmy
to
be
yet
excluded.
They
took
their
meal
in
silence.
Caroline
rose
once
to
remove
to
the
window
sill
a
glass
of
flowers
which
stood
on
the
sideboard,
the
exhalation
from
the
blossoms
being
somewhat
too
powerful
for
the
sultry
room.
In
returning
she
half
opened
a
drawer,
and
took
from
it
something
that
glittered
clear
and
keen
in
her
hand.
"You
assigned
this
to
me,
then,
Shirley,
did
you?
It
is
bright,
keen
edged,
finely
tapered;
it
is
dangerous
looking.
I
never
yet
felt
the
impulse
which
could
move
me
to
direct
this
against
a
fellow
creature.
It
is
difficult
to
fancy
that
circumstances
could
nerve
my
arm
to
strike
home
with
this
long
knife."
"I
should
hate
to
do
it,"
replied
Shirley,
"but
I
think
I
could
do
it,
if
goaded
by
certain
exigencies
which
I
can
imagine."
And
Miss
Keeldar
quietly
sipped
her
glass
of
new
milk,
looking
somewhat
thoughtful
and
a
little
pale;
though,
indeed,
when
did
she
not
look
pale?
She
was
never
florid.
The
milk
sipped
and
the
bread
eaten,
Fanny
was
again
summoned.
She
and
Eliza
were
recommended
to
go
to
bed,
which
they
were
quite
willing
to
do,
being
weary
of
the
day's
exertions,
of
much
cutting
of
currant
buns,
and
filling
of
urns
and
teapots,
and
running
backwards
and
forwards
with
trays.
Ere
long
the
maids'
chamber
door
was
heard
to
close.
Caroline
took
a
candle
and
went
quietly
all
over
the
house,
seeing
that
every
window
was
fast
and
every
door
barred.
She
did
not
even
evade
the
haunted
back
kitchen
nor
the
vault
like
cellars.
These
visited,
she
returned.
"There
is
neither
spirit
nor
flesh
in
the
house
at
present,"
she
said,
"which
should
not
be
there.
It
is
now
near
eleven
o'clock,
fully
bedtime;
yet
I
would
