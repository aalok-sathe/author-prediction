male
portraits.
"That
is
a
beautiful
face,"
said
Mrs.
Pryor,
interrupting
a
brief
pause
which
had
followed
half
an
hour's
animated
conversation.
"The
features
may
be
termed
perfect;
no
statuary's
chisel
could
improve
them.
It
is
a
portrait
from
the
life,
I
presume?"
"It
is
a
portrait
of
Mrs.
Helstone."
"Of
Mrs.
Matthewson
Helstone?
Of
your
uncle's
wife?"
"It
is,
and
is
said
to
be
a
good
likeness.
Before
her
marriage
she
was
accounted
the
beauty
of
the
district."
"I
should
say
she
merited
the
distinction.
What
accuracy
in
all
the
lineaments!
It
is,
however,
a
passive
face.
The
original
could
not
have
been
what
is
generally
termed
'a
woman
of
spirit.'"
"I
believe
she
was
a
remarkably
still,
silent
person."
"One
would
scarcely
have
expected,
my
dear,
that
your
uncle's
choice
should
have
fallen
on
a
partner
of
that
description.
Is
he
not
fond
of
being
amused
by
lively
chat?"
"In
company
he
is.
But
he
always
says
he
could
never
do
with
a
talking
wife.
He
must
have
quiet
at
home.
You
go
out
to
gossip,
he
affirms;
you
come
home
to
read
and
reflect."
"Mrs.
Matthewson
lived
but
a
few
years
after
her
marriage,
I
think
I
have
heard?"
"About
five
years."
"Well,
my
dear,"
pursued
Mrs.
Pryor,
rising
to
go,
"I
trust
it
is
understood
that
you
will
frequently
come
to
Fieldhead.
I
hope
you
will.
You
must
feel
lonely
here,
having
no
female
relative
in
the
house;
you
must
necessarily
pass
much
of
your
time
in
solitude."
"I
am
inured
to
it.
I
have
grown
up
by
myself.
May
I
arrange
your
shawl
for
you?"
Mrs.
Pryor
submitted
to
be
assisted.
"Should
you
chance
to
require
help
in
your
studies,"
she
said,
"you
may
command
me."
Caroline
expressed
her
sense
of
such
kindness.
"I
hope
to
have
frequent
conversations
with
you.
I
should
wish
to
be
of
use
to
you."
Again
Miss
Helstone
returned
thanks.
She
thought
what
a
kind
heart
was
hidden
under
her
visitor's
seeming
chilliness.
Observing
that
Mrs.
Pryor
again
glanced
with
an
air
of
interest
towards
the
portraits,
as
she
walked
down
the
room,
Caroline
casually
explained:
"The
likeness
that
hangs
near
the
window,
you
will
see,
is
my
uncle,
taken
twenty
years
ago;
the
other,
to
the
left
of
the
mantelpiece,
is
his
brother
James,
my
father."
"They
resemble
each
other
in
some
measure,"
said
Mrs.
Pryor;
"yet
a
difference
of
character
may
be
traced
in
the
different
mould
of
the
brow
and
mouth."
"What
difference?"
inquired
Caroline,
accompanying
her
to
the
door.
"James
Helstone
that
is,
my
father
is
generally
considered
the
best
looking
of
the
two.
Strangers,
I
remark,
always
exclaim,
'What
a
handsome
man!'
Do
you
think
his
picture
handsome,
Mrs.
Pryor?"
"It
is
much
softer
or
finer
featured
than
that
of
your
uncle."
"But
where
or
what
is
the
difference
of
character
to
which
you
alluded?
Tell
me.
I
wish
to
see
if
you
guess
right."
"My
dear,
your
uncle
is
a
man
of
principle.
His
