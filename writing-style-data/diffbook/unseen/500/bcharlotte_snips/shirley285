late
walk
home,
some
sweet,
poisoned
breeze,
redolent
of
honey
dew
and
miasma,
had
passed
into
her
lungs
and
veins,
and
finding
there
already
a
fever
of
mental
excitement,
and
a
languor
of
long
conflict
and
habitual
sadness,
had
fanned
the
spark
to
flame,
and
left
a
well
lit
fire
behind
it.
It
seemed,
however,
but
a
gentle
fire.
After
two
hot
days
and
worried
nights,
there
was
no
violence
in
the
symptoms,
and
neither
her
uncle,
nor
Fanny,
nor
the
doctor,
nor
Miss
Keeldar,
when
she
called,
had
any
fear
for
her.
A
few
days
would
restore
her,
every
one
believed.
The
few
days
passed,
and
though
it
was
still
thought
it
could
not
long
delay
the
revival
had
not
begun.
Mrs.
Pryor,
who
had
visited
her
daily
being
present
in
her
chamber
one
morning
when
she
had
been
ill
a
fortnight
watched
her
very
narrowly
for
some
minutes.
She
took
her
hand
and
placed
her
finger
on
her
wrist;
then,
quietly
leaving
the
chamber,
she
went
to
Mr.
Helstone's
study.
With
him
she
remained
closeted
a
long
time
half
the
morning.
On
returning
to
her
sick
young
friend,
she
laid
aside
shawl
and
bonnet.
She
stood
awhile
at
the
bedside,
one
hand
placed
in
the
other,
gently
rocking
herself
to
and
fro,
in
an
attitude
and
with
a
movement
habitual
to
her.
At
last
she
said,
"I
have
sent
Fanny
to
Fieldhead
to
fetch
a
few
things
for
me,
such
as
I
shall
want
during
a
short
stay
here.
It
is
my
wish
to
remain
with
you
till
you
are
better.
Your
uncle
kindly
permits
my
attendance.
Will
it
to
yourself
be
acceptable,
Caroline?"
"I
am
sorry
you
should
take
such
needless
trouble.
I
do
not
feel
very
ill,
but
I
cannot
refuse
resolutely.
It
will
be
such
comfort
to
know
you
are
in
the
house,
to
see
you
sometimes
in
the
room;
but
don't
confine
yourself
on
my
account,
dear
Mrs.
Pryor.
Fanny
nurses
me
very
well."
Mrs.
Pryor,
bending
over
the
pale
little
sufferer,
was
now
smoothing
the
hair
under
her
cap,
and
gently
raising
her
pillow.
As
she
performed
these
offices,
Caroline,
smiling,
lifted
her
face
to
kiss
her.
"Are
you
free
from
pain?
Are
you
tolerably
at
ease?"
was
inquired
in
a
low,
earnest
voice,
as
the
self
elected
nurse
yielded
to
the
caress.
"I
think
I
am
almost
happy."
"You
wish
to
drink?
Your
lips
are
parched."
She
held
a
glass
filled
with
some
cooling
beverage
to
her
mouth.
"Have
you
eaten
anything
to
day,
Caroline?"
"I
cannot
eat."
"But
soon
your
appetite
will
return;
it
must
return
that
is,
I
pray
God
it
may."
In
laying
her
again
on
the
couch,
she
encircled
her
in
her
arms;
and
while
so
doing,
by
a
movement
which
seemed
scarcely
voluntary,
she
drew
her
to
her
heart,
and
held
her
close
gathered
an
instant.
"I
shall
hardly
wish
to
get
well,
that
I
may
keep
you
always,"
said
Caroline.
Mrs.
Pryor
did
not
smile
at
