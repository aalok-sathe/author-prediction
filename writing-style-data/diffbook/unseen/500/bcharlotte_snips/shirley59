ten
days,
sneered
at
as
she
would
be
by
all
the
young
coquines
in
your
factory;"
then
softening,
"You
are
very
good,
dear
brother
excuse
my
petulance
but
truly
my
domestic
trials
are
severe,
yet
they
are
probably
my
destiny;
for
I
recollect
that
our
revered
mother
experienced
similar
sufferings,
though
she
had
the
choice
of
all
the
best
servants
in
Antwerp.
Domestics
are
in
all
countries
a
spoiled
and
unruly
set."
Mr.
Moore
had
also
certain
reminiscences
about
the
trials
of
his
revered
mother.
A
good
mother
she
had
been
to
him,
and
he
honoured
her
memory;
but
he
recollected
that
she
kept
a
hot
kitchen
of
it
in
Antwerp,
just
as
his
faithful
sister
did
here
in
England.
Thus,
therefore,
he
let
the
subject
drop,
and
when
the
coffee
service
was
removed,
proceeded
to
console
Hortense
by
fetching
her
music
book
and
guitar;
and
having
arranged
the
ribbon
of
the
instrument
round
her
neck
with
a
quiet
fraternal
kindness
he
knew
to
be
all
powerful
in
soothing
her
most
ruffled
moods,
he
asked
her
to
give
him
some
of
their
mother's
favourite
songs.
Nothing
refines
like
affection.
Family
jarring
vulgarizes;
family
union
elevates.
Hortense,
pleased
with
her
brother,
and
grateful
to
him,
looked,
as
she
touched
her
guitar,
almost
graceful,
almost
handsome;
her
everyday
fretful
look
was
gone
for
a
moment,
and
was
replaced
by
a
"sourire
plein
de
bonte."
She
sang
the
songs
he
asked
for,
with
feeling;
they
reminded
her
of
a
parent
to
whom
she
had
been
truly
attached;
they
reminded
her
of
her
young
days.
She
observed,
too,
that
Caroline
listened
with
naive
interest;
this
augmented
her
good
humour;
and
the
exclamation
at
the
close
of
the
song,
"I
wish
I
could
sing
and
play
like
Hortense!"
achieved
the
business,
and
rendered
her
charming
for
the
evening.
It
is
true
a
little
lecture
to
Caroline
followed,
on
the
vanity
of
wishing
and
the
duty
of
trying.
"As
Rome,"
it
was
suggested,
"had
not
been
built
in
a
day,
so
neither
had
Mademoiselle
Gerard
Moore's
education
been
completed
in
a
week,
or
by
merely
wishing
to
be
clever.
It
was
effort
that
had
accomplished
that
great
work.
She
was
ever
remarkable
for
her
perseverance,
for
her
industry.
Her
masters
had
remarked
that
it
was
as
delightful
as
it
was
uncommon
to
find
so
much
talent
united
with
so
much
solidity,
and
so
on."
Once
on
the
theme
of
her
own
merits,
mademoiselle
was
fluent.
Cradled
at
last
in
blissful
self
complacency,
she
took
her
knitting,
and
sat
down
tranquil.
Drawn
curtains,
a
clear
fire,
a
softly
shining
lamp,
gave
now
to
the
little
parlour
its
best,
its
evening
charm.
It
is
probable
that
the
three
there
present
felt
this
charm.
They
all
looked
happy.
"What
shall
we
do
now,
Caroline?"
asked
Mr.
Moore,
returning
to
his
seat
beside
his
cousin.
"What
shall
we
do,
Robert?"
repeated
she
playfully.
"You
decide."
"Not
play
at
chess?"
"No."
"Nor
draughts,
nor
backgammon?"
"No,
no;
we
both
hate
silent
