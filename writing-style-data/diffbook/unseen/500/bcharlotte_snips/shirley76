the

other

would
rather

himself
at

any

brought
with
"Mrs.
Rouse's
compliments;
and
please,
ma'am,
she
says
it's
your
turn
now."
Miss
Helstone's
duties
of
hostess
performed,
more
anxiously
than
cheerily,
she
betook
herself
to
the
kitchen,
to
hold
a
brief
privy
council
with
Fanny
and
Eliza
about
the
tea.
"What
a
lot
on
'em!"
cried
Eliza,
who
was
cook.
"And
I
put
off
the
baking
to
day
because
I
thought
there
would
be
bread
plenty
to
fit
while
morning.
We
shall
never
have
enow."
"Are
there
any
tea
cakes?"
asked
the
young
mistress.
"Only
three
and
a
loaf.
I
wish
these
fine
folk
would
stay
at
home
till
they're
asked;
and
I
want
to
finish
trimming
my
hat"
(bonnet
she
meant).
"Then,"
suggested
Caroline,
to
whom
the
importance
of
the
emergency
gave
a
certain
energy,
"Fanny
must
run
down
to
Briarfield
and
buy
some
muffins
and
crumpets
and
some
biscuits.
And
don't
be
cross,
Eliza;
we
can't
help
it
now."
"And
which
tea
things
are
we
to
have?"
"Oh,
the
best,
I
suppose.
I'll
get
out
the
silver
service."
And
she
ran
upstairs
to
the
plate
closet,
and
presently
brought
down
teapot,
cream
ewer,
and
sugar
basin.
"And
mun
we
have
th'
urn?"
"Yes;
and
now
get
it
ready
as
quickly
as
you
can,
for
the
sooner
we
have
tea
over
the
sooner
they
will
go
at
least,
I
hope
so.
Heigh
ho!
I
wish
they
were
gone,"
she
sighed,
as
she
returned
to
the
drawing
room.
"Still,"
she
thought,
as
she
paused
at
the
door
ere
opening
it,
"if
Robert
would
but
come
even
now
how
bright
all
would

How
comparatively

the
task
of
amusing
these
people

he
were
present!
There
would
be
an
interest
in
hearing
him
talk
(though
he
never
says
much
in
company)
and
in
talking
in
his
presence.
There
can
be
no
interest

hearing
any
of

or
in
speaking
to
them.
