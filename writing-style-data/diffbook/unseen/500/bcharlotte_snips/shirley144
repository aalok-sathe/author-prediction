Mrs.
Gill,
my
housekeeper,
might
pack
our
provisions,
and
we
could
each
carry
our
own.
It
would
not
tire
you
too
much
to
walk
so
far?"
"Oh
no;
especially
if
we
rested
the
whole
day
in
the
wood.
And
I
know
all
the
pleasantest
spots.
I
know
where
we
could
get
nuts
in
nutting
time;
I
know
where
wild
strawberries
abound;
I
know
certain
lonely,
quite
untrodden
glades,
carpeted
with
strange
mosses,
some
yellow
as
if
gilded,
some
a
sober
gray,
some
gem
green.
I
know
groups
of
trees
that
ravish
the
eye
with
their
perfect,
picture
like
effects
rude
oak,
delicate
birch,
glossy
beech,
clustered
in
contrast;
and
ash
trees
stately
as
Saul,
standing
isolated;
and
superannuated
wood
giants
clad
in
bright
shrouds
of
ivy.
Miss
Keeldar,
I
could
guide
you."
"You
would
be
dull
with
me
alone?"
"I
should
not.
I
think
we
should
suit;
and
what
third
person
is
there
whose
presence
would
not
spoil
our
pleasure?"
"Indeed,
I
know
of
none
about
our
own
ages
no
lady
at
least;
and
as
to
gentlemen
"
"An
excursion
becomes
quite
a
different
thing
when
there
are
gentlemen
of
the
party,"
interrupted
Caroline.
"I
agree
with
you
quite
a
different
thing
to
what
we
were
proposing."
"We
were
going
simply
to
see
the
old
trees,
the
old
ruins;
to
pass
a
day
in
old
times,
surrounded
by
olden
silence,
and
above
all
by
quietude."
"You
are
right;
and
the
presence
of
gentlemen
dispels
the
last
charm,
I
think.
If
they
are
of
the
wrong
sort,
like
your
Malones,
and
your
young
Sykes,
and
Wynnes,
irritation
takes
the
place
of
serenity.
If
they
are
of
the
right
sort,
there
is
still
a
change;
I
can
hardly
tell
what
change
one
easy
to
feel,
difficult
to
describe."
"We
forget
Nature,
imprimis."
"And
then
Nature
forgets
us,
covers
her
vast
calm
brow
with
a
dim
veil,
conceals
her
face,
and
withdraws
the
peaceful
joy
with
which,
if
we
had
been
content
to
worship
her
only,
she
would
have
filled
our
hearts."
"What
does
she
give
us
instead?"
"More
elation
and
more
anxiety;
an
excitement
that
steals
the
hours
away
fast,
and
a
trouble
that
ruffles
their
course."
"Our
power
of
being
happy
lies
a
good
deal
in
ourselves,
I
believe,"
remarked
Caroline
sagely.
"I
have
gone
to
Nunnwood
with
a
large
party
all
the
curates
and
some
other
gentry
of
these
parts,
together
with
sundry
ladies
and
I
found
the
affair
insufferably
tedious
and
absurd;
and
I
have
gone
quite
alone,
or
accompanied
but
by
Fanny,
who
sat
in
the
woodman's
hut
and
sewed,
or
talked
to
the
goodwife,
while
I
roamed
about
and
made
sketches,
or
read;
and
I
have
enjoyed
much
happiness
of
a
quiet
kind
all
day
long.
But
that
was
when
I
was
young
two
years
ago."
"Did
you
ever
go
with
your
cousin,
Robert
Moore?"
"Yes;
once."
"What
sort
of
a
companion
is
he
on
these
occasions?"
"A
cousin,
you
know,
is
different
to
a
stranger."
"I
