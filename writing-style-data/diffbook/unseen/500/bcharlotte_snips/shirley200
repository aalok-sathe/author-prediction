was
almost
an
enjoyment.
Miss
Keeldar
was
better
in
her
single
self
than
a
host
of
ordinary
friends.
Quite
self
possessed,
and
always
spirited
and
easy;
conscious
of
her
social
importance,
yet
never
presuming
upon
it
it
would
be
enough
to
give
one
courage
only
to
look
at
her.
The
only
fear
was
lest
the
heiress
should
not
be
punctual
to
tryst.
She
often
had
a
careless
way
of
lingering
behind
time,
and
Caroline
knew
her
uncle
would
not
wait
a
second
for
any
one.
At
the
moment
of
the
church
clock
tolling
two,
the
bells
would
clash
out
and
the
march
begin.
She
must
look
after
Shirley,
then,
in
this
matter,
or
her
expected
companion
would
fail
her.
Whit
Tuesday
saw
her
rise
almost
with
the
sun.
She,
Fanny,
and
Eliza
were
busy
the
whole
morning
arranging
the
rectory
parlours
in
first
rate
company
order,
and
setting
out
a
collation
of
cooling
refreshments
wine,
fruit,
cakes
on
the
dining
room
sideboard.
Then
she
had
to
dress
in
her
freshest
and
fairest
attire
of
white
muslin:
the
perfect
fineness
of
the
day
and
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
warranted,
and
even
exacted,
such
costume.
Her
new
sash
a
birthday
present
from
Margaret
Hall,
which
she
had
reason
to
believe
Cyril
himself
had
bought,
and
in
return
for
which
she
had
indeed
given
him
a
set
of
cambric
bands
in
a
handsome
case
was
tied
by
the
dexterous
fingers
of
Fanny,
who
took
no
little
pleasure
in
arraying
her
fair
young
mistress
for
the
occasion.
Her
simple
bonnet
had
been
trimmed
to
correspond
with
her
sash;
her
pretty
but
inexpensive
scarf
of
white
crape
suited
her
dress.
When
ready
she
formed
a
picture,
not
bright
enough
to
dazzle,
but
fair
enough
to
interest;
not
brilliantly
striking,
but
very
delicately
pleasing
a
picture
in
which
sweetness
of
tint,
purity
of
air,
and
grace
of
mien
atoned
for
the
absence
of
rich
colouring
and
magnificent
contour.
What
her
brown
eye
and
clear
forehead
showed
of
her
mind
was
in
keeping
with
her
dress
and
face
modest,
gentle,
and,
though
pensive,
harmonious.
It
appeared
that
neither
lamb
nor
dove
need
fear
her,
but
would
welcome
rather,
in
her
look
of
simplicity
and
softness,
a
sympathy
with
their
own
natures,
or
with
the
natures
we
ascribe
to
them.
After
all,
she
was
an
imperfect,
faulty
human
being,
fair
enough
of
form,
hue,
and
array,
but,
as
Cyril
Hall
said,
neither
so
good
nor
so
great
as
the
withered
Miss
Ainley,
now
putting
on
her
best
black
gown
and
Quaker
drab
shawl
and
bonnet
in
her
own
narrow
cottage
chamber.
Away
Caroline
went,
across
some
very
sequestered
fields
and
through
some
quite
hidden
lanes,
to
Fieldhead.
She
glided
quickly
under
the
green
hedges
and
across
the
greener
leas.
There
was
no
dust,
no
moisture,
to
soil
the
hem
of
her
stainless
garment,
or
to
damp
her
slender
sandal.
After
the
late
rains
all
was
clean,
and
under
the
present
glowing
sun
all
was
dry.
She
walked
