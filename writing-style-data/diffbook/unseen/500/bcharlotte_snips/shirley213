did
perhaps
he
meant
to
speak
to
her;
but
there
was
yet
a
parting
word
to
exchange
with
Miss
Keeldar,
and
while
it
was
being
uttered
Caroline
had
vanished.
Hortense
received
her
former
pupil
with
a
demeanour
of
more
dignity
than
warmth.
She
had
been
seriously
offended
by
Mr.
Helstone's
proceedings,
and
had
all
along
considered
Caroline
to
blame
in
obeying
her
uncle
too
literally.
"You
are
a
very
great
stranger,"
she
said
austerely,
as
her
pupil
held
and
pressed
her
hand.
The
pupil
knew
her
too
well
to
remonstrate
or
complain
of
coldness.
She
let
the
punctilious
whim
pass,
sure
that
her
natural
bonte
(I
use
this
French
word
because
it
expresses
just
what
I
mean
neither
goodness
nor
good
nature,
but
something
between
the
two)
would
presently
get
the
upper
hand.
It
did.
Hortense
had
no
sooner
examined
her
face
well,
and
observed
the
change
its
somewhat
wasted
features
betrayed,
than
her
mien
softened.
Kissing
her
on
both
cheeks,
she
asked
anxiously
after
her
health.
Caroline
answered
gaily.
It
would,
however,
have
been
her
lot
to
undergo
a
long
cross
examination,
followed
by
an
endless
lecture
on
this
head,
had
not
Miss
Mann
called
off
the
attention
of
the
questioner
by
requesting
to
be
conducted
home.
The
poor
invalid
was
already
fatigued.
Her
weariness
made
her
cross
too
cross
almost
to
speak
to
Caroline;
and
besides,
that
young
person's
white
dress
and
lively
look
were
displeasing
in
the
eyes
of
Miss
Mann.
The
everyday
garb
of
brown
stuff
or
gray
gingham,
and
the
everyday
air
of
melancholy,
suited
the
solitary
spinster
better;
she
would
hardly
know
her
young
friend
to
night,
and
quitted
her
with
a
cool
nod.
Hortense
having
promised
to
accompany
her
home,
they
departed
together.
Caroline
now
looked
round
for
Shirley.
She
saw
the
rainbow
scarf
and
purple
dress
in
the
centre
of
a
throng
of
ladies,
all
well
known
to
herself,
but
all
of
the
order
whom
she
systematically
avoided
whenever
avoidance
was
possible.
Shyer
at
some
moments
than
at
others,
she
felt
just
now
no
courage
at
all
to
join
this
company.
She
could
not,
however,
stand
alone
where
all
others
went
in
pairs
or
parties;
so
she
approached
a
group
of
her
own
scholars,
great
girls,
or
rather
young
women,
who
were
standing
watching
some
hundreds
of
the
younger
children
playing
at
blind
man's
buff.
Miss
Helstone
knew
these
girls
liked
her,
yet
she
was
shy
even
with
them
out
of
school.
They
were
not
more
in
awe
of
her
than
she
of
them.
She
drew
near
them
now,
rather
to
find
protection
in
their
company
than
to
patronize
them
with
her
presence.
By
some
instinct
they
knew
her
weakness,
and
with
natural
politeness
they
respected
it.
Her
knowledge
commanded
their
esteem
when
she
taught
them;
her
gentleness
attracted
their
regard;
and
because
she
was
what
they
considered
wise
and
good
when
on
duty,
they
kindly
overlooked
her
evident
timidity
when
off.
They
did
not
take
advantage
of
it.
