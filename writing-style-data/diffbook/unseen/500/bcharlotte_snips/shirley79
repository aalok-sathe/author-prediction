in
society,
attractive
female
society?
it
being
only
with
the
one
lady
of
his
own
family
that
he
maintained
a
grim
taciturnity
kept
up
a
brilliant
flow
of
easy
prattle
with
his
right
hand
and
left
hand
neighbours,
and
even
with
his
vis
a
vis,
Miss
Mary;
though,
as
Mary
was
the
most
sensible,
the
least
coquettish,
of
the
three,
to
her
the
elderly
widower
was
the
least
attentive.
At
heart
he
could
not
abide
sense
in
women.
He
liked
to
see
them
as
silly,
as
light
headed,
as
vain,
as
open
to
ridicule
as
possible,
because
they
were
then
in
reality
what
he
held
them
to
be,
and
wished
them
to
be
inferior,
toys
to
play
with,
to
amuse
a
vacant
hour,
and
to
be
thrown
away.
Hannah
was
his
favourite.
Harriet,
though
beautiful,
egotistical,
and
self
satisfied,
was
not
quite
weak
enough
for
him.
She
had
some
genuine
self
respect
amidst
much
false
pride,
and
if
she
did
not
talk
like
an
oracle,
neither
would
she
babble
like
one
crazy;
she
would
not
permit
herself
to
be
treated
quite
as
a
doll,
a
child,
a
plaything;
she
expected
to
be
bent
to
like
a
queen.
Hannah,
on
the
contrary,
demanded
no
respect,
only
flattery.
If
her
admirers
only
told
her
that
she
was
an
angel,
she
would
let
them
treat
her
like
an
idiot.
So
very
credulous
and
frivolous
was
she,
so
very
silly
did
she
become
when
besieged
with
attention,
flattered
and
admired
to
the
proper
degree,
that
there
were
moments
when
Helstone
actually
felt
tempted
to
commit
matrimony
a
second
time,
and
to
try
the
experiment
of
taking
her
for
his
second
helpmeet;
but
fortunately
the
salutary
recollection
of
the
ennuis
of
his
first
marriage,
the
impression
still
left
on
him
of
the
weight
of
the
millstone
he
had
once
worn
round
his
neck,
the
fixity
of
his
feelings
respecting
the
insufferable
evils
of
conjugal
existence,
operated
as
a
check
to
his
tenderness,
suppressed
the
sigh
heaving
his
old
iron
lungs,
and
restrained
him
from
whispering
to
Hannah
proposals
it
would
have
been
high
fun
and
great
satisfaction
to
her
to
hear.
It
is
probable
she
would
have
married
him
if
he
had
asked
her;
her
parents
would
have
quite
approved
the
match.
To
them
his
fifty
five
years,
his
bend
leather
heart,
could
have
presented
no
obstacles;
and
as
he
was
a
rector,
held
an
excellent
living,
occupied
a
good
house,
and
was
supposed
even
to
have
private
property
(though
in
that
the
world
was
mistaken;
every
penny
of
the
5,000
inherited
by
him
from
his
father
had
been
devoted
to
the
building
and
endowing
of
a
new
church
at
his
native
village
in
Lancashire
for
he
could
show
a
lordly
munificence
when
he
pleased,
and
if
the
end
was
to
his
liking,
never
hesitated
about
making
a
grand
sacrifice
to
attain
it)
her
parents,
I
say,
would
have
delivered
Hannah
over
to
his
lovingkindness
and
his
tender
mercies
without
one
scruple;
and
