choice;
he
shall
go
with
you,"
responded
Yorke.
"It's
midnight,
and
past;
and
I'll
have
nob'dy
staying
up
i'
my
house
any
longer.
Ye
mun
all
go."
He
rang
the
bell.
"Deb,"
said
he
to
the
servant
who
answered
it,
"clear
them
folk
out
o'
t'
kitchen,
and
lock
t'
doors,
and
be
off
to
bed.
Here
is
your
way,
gentlemen,"
he
continued
to
his
guests;
and,
lighting
them
through
the
passage,
he
fairly
put
them
out
at
his
front
door.
They
met
their
party
hurrying
out
pell
mell
by
the
back
way.
Their
horses
stood
at
the
gate;
they
mounted,
and
rode
off,
Moore
laughing
at
their
abrupt
dismissal,
Helstone
deeply
indignant
thereat.
Moore's
good
spirits
were
still
with
him
when
he
rose
next
morning.
He
and
Joe
Scott
had
both
spent
the
night
in
the
mill,
availing
themselves
of
certain
sleeping
accommodations
producible
from
recesses
in
the
front
and
back
counting
houses.
The
master,
always
an
early
riser,
was
up
somewhat
sooner
even
than
usual.
He
awoke
his
man
by
singing
a
French
song
as
he
made
his
toilet.
"Ye're
not
custen
dahn,
then,
maister?"
cried
Joe.
"Not
a
stiver,
mon
garcon
which
means,
my
lad.
Get
up,
and
we'll
take
a
turn
through
the
mill
before
the
hands
come
in,
and
I'll
explain
my
future
plans.
We'll
have
the
machinery
yet,
Joseph.
You
never
heard
of
Bruce,
perhaps?"
"And
th'
arrand
(spider)?
Yes,
but
I
hev.
I've
read
th'
history
o'
Scotland,
and
happen
knaw
as
mich
on't
as
ye;
and
I
understand
ye
to
mean
to
say
ye'll
persevere."
"I
do."
"Is
there
mony
o'
your
mak'
i'
your
country?"
inquired
Joe,
as
he
folded
up
his
temporary
bed,
and
put
it
away.
"In
my
country!
Which
is
my
country?"
"Why,
France
isn't
it?"
"Not
it,
indeed!
The
circumstance
of
the
French
having
seized
Antwerp,
where
I
was
born,
does
not
make
me
a
Frenchman."
"Holland,
then?"
"I
am
not
a
Dutchman.
Now
you
are
confounding
Antwerp
with
Amsterdam."
"Flanders?"
"I
scorn
the
insinuation,
Joe!
I
a
Flamand!
Have
I
a
Flemish
face
the
clumsy
nose
standing
out,
the
mean
forehead
falling
back,
the
pale
blue
eyes
'a
fleur
de
tete'?
Am
I
all
body
and
no
legs,
like
a
Flamand?
But
you
don't
know
what
they
are
like,
those
Netherlanders.
Joe,
I'm
an
Anversois.
My
mother
was
an
Anversoise,
though
she
came
of
French
lineage,
which
is
the
reason
I
speak
French."
"But
your
father
war
Yorkshire,
which
maks
ye
a
bit
Yorkshire
too;
and
onybody
may
see
ye're
akin
to
us,
ye're
so
keen
o'
making
brass,
and
getting
forrards."
"Joe,
you're
an
impudent
dog;
but
I've
always
been
accustomed
to
a
boorish
sort
of
insolence
from
my
youth
up.
The
'classe
ouvriere'
that
is,
the
working
people
in
Belgium
bear
themselves
brutally
towards
their
employers;
and
by
brutally,
Joe,
I
mean
brutalement
which,
perhaps,
when
properly
translated,
should
be
roughly."
"We
allus
speak
our
minds
i'
this
country;
and
them
young
parsons
and
