emotion.
He
then
demanded,
"What
else
did
she
say?"
"When
I
had
signified
my
full
consent
to
the
conditions
of
her
will,
she
told
me
I
was
a
generous
boy,
and
she
was
proud
of
me.
'And
now,'
she
added,
'in
case
anything
should
happen,
you
will
know
what
to
say
to
Malice
when
she
comes
whispering
hard
things
in
your
ear,
insinuating
that
Shirley
has
wronged
you,
that
she
did
not
love
you.
You
will
know
that
I
did
love
you,
Harry;
that
no
sister
could
have
loved
you
better
my
own
treasure.'
Mr.
Moore,
sir,
when
I
remember
her
voice,
and
recall
her
look,
my
heart
beats
as
if
it
would
break
its
strings.
She
may
go
to
heaven
before
me
if
God
commands
it,
she
must;
but
the
rest
of
my
life
and
my
life
will
not
be
long,
I
am
glad
of
that
now
shall
be
a
straight,
quick,
thoughtful
journey
in
the
path
her
step
has
pressed.
I
thought
to
enter
the
vault
of
the
Keeldars
before
her.
Should
it
be
otherwise,
lay
my
coffin
by
Shirley's
side."
Moore
answered
him
with
a
weighty
calm,
that
offered
a
strange
contrast
to
the
boy's
perturbed
enthusiasm.
"You
are
wrong,
both
of
you
you
harm
each
other.
If
youth
once
falls
under
the
influence
of
a
shadowy
terror,
it
imagines
there
will
never
be
full
sunlight
again;
its
first
calamity
it
fancies
will
last
a
lifetime.
What
more
did
she
say?
Anything
more?"
"We
settled
one
or
two
family
points
between
ourselves."
"I
should
rather
like
to
know
what
"
"But,
Mr.
Moore,
you
smile.
I
could
not
smile
to
see
Shirley
in
such
a
mood."
"My
boy,
I
am
neither
nervous,
nor
poetic,
nor
inexperienced.
I
see
things
as
they
are;
you
don't
as
yet.
Tell
me
these
family
points."
"Only,
sir,
she
asked
me
whether
I
considered
myself
most
of
a
Keeldar
or
a
Sympson;
and
I
answered
I
was
Keeldar
to
the
core
of
the
heart
and
to
the
marrow
of
the
bones.
She
said
she
was
glad
of
it;
for,
besides
her,
I
was
the
only
Keeldar
left
in
England.
And
then
we
agreed
on
some
matters."
"Well?"
"Well,
sir,
that
if
I
lived
to
inherit
my
father's
estate,
and
her
house,
I
was
to
take
the
name
of
Keeldar,
and
to
make
Fieldhead
my
residence.
Henry
Shirley
Keeldar
I
said
I
would
be
called;
and
I
will.
Her
name
and
her
manor
house
are
ages
old,
and
Sympson
and
Sympson
Grove
are
of
yesterday."
"Come,
you
are
neither
of
you
going
to
heaven
yet.
I
have
the
best
hopes
of
you
both,
with
your
proud
distinctions
a
pair
of
half
fledged
eaglets.
Now,
what
is
your
inference
from
all
you
have
told
me?
Put
it
into
words."
"That
Shirley
thinks
she
is
going
to
die."
"She
referred
to
her
health?"
"Not
once;
but
I
assure
you
she
is
wasting.
Her
hands
are
grown
quite
thin,
and
so
is
her
cheek."
"Does
she
