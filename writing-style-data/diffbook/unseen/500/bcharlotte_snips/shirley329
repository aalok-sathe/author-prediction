lofty
tone,
a
deep,
soft
sound,
like
a
storm
whispering,
made
twilight
undulate.
Once
more,
profounder,
nearer,
clearer,
it
rolled
harmonious.
Yet
again
a
distinct
voice
passed
between
Heaven
and
Earth.
"Eva!"
If
Eva
were
not
this
woman's
name,
she
had
none.
She
rose.
"Here
am
I."
"Eva!"
"O
Night
(it
can
be
but
Night
that
speaks),
I
am
here!"
The
voice,
descending,
reached
Earth.
"Eva!"
"Lord,"
she
cried,
"behold
thine
handmaid!"
She
had
her
religion
all
tribes
held
some
creed.
"I
come
a
Comforter!"
"Lord,
come
quickly!"
The
Evening
flushed
full
of
hope;
the
Air
panted;
the
Moon
rising
before
ascended
large,
but
her
light
showed
no
shape.
"Lean
towards
me,
Eva.
Enter
my
arms;
repose
thus."
"Thus
I
lean,
O
Invisible
but
felt!
And
what
art
thou?"
"Eva,
I
have
brought
a
living
draught
from
heaven.
Daughter
of
Man,
drink
of
my
cup!"
"I
drink:
it
is
as
if
sweetest
dew
visited
my
lips
in
a
full
current.
My
arid
heart
revives;
my
affliction
is
lightened;
my
strait
and
struggle
are
gone.
And
the
night
changes!
the
wood,
the
hill,
the
moon,
the
wide
sky
all
change!"
"All
change,
and
for
ever.
I
take
from
thy
vision
darkness;
I
loosen
from
thy
faculties
fetters!
I
level
in
thy
path
obstacles;
I
with
my
presence
fill
vacancy.
I
claim
as
mine
the
lost
atom
of
life.
I
take
to
myself
the
spark
of
soul
burning
heretofore
forgotten!"
"O
take
me!
O
claim
me!
This
is
a
god."
"This
is
a
son
of
God
one
who
feels
himself
in
the
portion
of
life
that
stirs
you.
He
is
suffered
to
reclaim
his
own,
and
so
to
foster
and
aid
that
it
shall
not
perish
hopeless."
"A
son
of
God!
Am
I
indeed
chosen?"
"Thou
only
in
this
land.
I
saw
thee
that
thou
wert
fair;
I
knew
thee
that
thou
wert
mine.
To
me
it
is
given
to
rescue,
to
sustain,
to
cherish
mine
own.
Acknowledge
in
me
that
Seraph
on
earth
named
Genius."
"My
glorious
Bridegroom!
true
Dayspring
from
on
high!
All
I
would
have
at
last
I
possess.
I
receive
a
revelation.
The
dark
hint,
the
obscure
whisper,
which
have
haunted
me
from
childhood,
are
interpreted.
Thou
art
He
I
sought.
Godborn,
take
me,
thy
bride!"
"Unhumbled,
I
can
take
what
is
mine.
Did
I
not
give
from
the
altar
the
very
flame
which
lit
Eva's
being?
Come
again
into
the
heaven
whence
thou
wert
sent."
That
Presence,
invisible
but
mighty,
gathered
her
in
like
a
lamb
to
the
fold;
that
voice,
soft
but
all
pervading,
vibrated
through
her
heart
like
music.
Her
eye
received
no
image;
and
yet
a
sense
visited
her
vision
and
her
brain
as
of
the
serenity
of
stainless
air,
the
power
of
sovereign
seas,
the
majesty
of
marching
stars,
the
energy
of
colliding
elements,
the
rooted
endurance
of
hills
wide
based,
and,
above
all,
as
of
the
lustre
of
heroic
beauty
rushing
victorious
on
the
Night,
vanquishing
its
shadows
like
a
diviner
sun.
