him
no
longer
"a
mad
girl,"
but
a
"most
sensible
woman."
He
termed
her,
in
confidential
dialogues
with
Mrs.
Sympson,
"a
truly
superior
person;
peculiar,
but
very
clever."
He
treated
her
with
exceeding
deference;
rose
reverently
to
open
and
shut
doors
for
her;
reddened
his
face
and
gave
himself
headaches
with
stooping
to
pick
up
gloves,
handkerchiefs,
and
other
loose
property,
whereof
Shirley
usually
held
but
insecure
tenure.
He
would
cut
mysterious
jokes
about
the
superiority
of
woman's
wit
over
man's
wisdom;
commence
obscure
apologies
for
the
blundering
mistake
he
had
committed
respecting
the
generalship,
the
tactics,
of
"a
personage
not
a
hundred
miles
from
Fieldhead."
In
short,
he
seemed
elate
as
any
"midden
cock
on
pattens."
His
niece
viewed
his
maneauvres
and
received
his
innuendoes
with
phlegm;
apparently
she
did
not
above
half
comprehend
to
what
aim
they
tended.
When
plainly
charged
with
being
the
preferred
of
the
baronet,
she
said
she
believed
he
did
like
her,
and
for
her
part
she
liked
him.
She
had
never
thought
a
man
of
rank
the
only
son
of
a
proud,
fond
mother,
the
only
brother
of
doting
sisters
could
have
so
much
goodness,
and,
on
the
whole,
so
much
sense.
Time
proved,
indeed,
that
Sir
Philip
liked
her.
Perhaps
he
had
found
in
her
that
"curious
charm"
noticed
by
Mr.
Hall.
He
sought
her
presence
more
and
more,
and
at
last
with
a
frequency
that
attested
it
had
become
to
him
an
indispensable
stimulus.
About
this
time
strange
feelings
hovered
round
Fieldhead;
restless
hopes
and
haggard
anxieties
haunted
some
of
its
rooms.
There
was
an
unquiet
wandering
of
some
of
the
inmates
among
the
still
fields
round
the
mansion;
there
was
a
sense
of
expectancy
that
kept
the
nerves
strained.
One
thing
seemed
clear:
Sir
Philip
was
not
a
man
to
be
despised.
He
was
amiable;
if
not
highly
intellectual,
he
was
intelligent.
Miss
Keeldar
could
not
affirm
of
him,
what
she
had
so
bitterly
affirmed
of
Sam
Wynne,
that
his
feelings
were
blunt,
his
tastes
coarse,
and
his
manners
vulgar.
There
was
sensibility
in
his
nature;
there
was
a
very
real,
if
not
a
very
discriminating,
love
of
the
arts;
there
was
the
English
gentleman
in
all
his
deportment.
As
to
his
lineage
and
wealth,
both
were,
of
course,
far
beyond
her
claims.
His
appearance
had
at
first
elicited
some
laughing
though
not
ill
natured
remarks
from
the
merry
Shirley.
It
was
boyish.
His
features
were
plain
and
slight,
his
hair
sandy,
his
stature
insignificant.
But
she
soon
checked
her
sarcasm
on
this
point;
she
would
even
fire
up
if
any
one
else
made
uncomplimentary
allusion
thereto.
He
had
"a
pleasing
countenance,"
she
affirmed;
"and
there
was
that
in
his
heart
which
was
better
than
three
Roman
noses,
than
the
locks
of
Absalom
or
the
proportions
of
Saul."
A
spare
and
rare
shaft
she
still
reserved
for
his
unfortunate
poetic
propensity;
but
even
here
she
would
tolerate
no
irony
save
her
own.
In
short,
matters
had
reached
a
point
which
