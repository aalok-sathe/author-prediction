Samuel
called
of
God
from
his
birth.
He
was
to
be
a
clergyman.
Mr.
and
the
Misses
Sympson,
not
understanding
the
youth,
let
him
much
alone.
Shirley
made
him
her
pet,
and
he
made
Shirley
his
playmate.
In
the
midst
of
this
family
circle,
or
rather
outside
it,
moved
the
tutor
the
satellite.
Yes,
Louis
Moore
was
a
satellite
of
the
house
of
Sympson
connected,
yet
apart;
ever
attendant,
ever
distant.
Each
member
of
that
correct
family
treated
him
with
proper
dignity.
The
father
was
austerely
civil,
sometimes
irritable;
the
mother,
being
a
kind
woman,
was
attentive,
but
formal;
the
daughters
saw
in
him
an
abstraction,
not
a
man.
It
seemed,
by
their
manner,
that
their
brother's
tutor
did
not
live
for
them.
They
were
learned;
so
was
he
but
not
for
them.
They
were
accomplished;
he
had
talents
too,
imperceptible
to
their
senses.
The
most
spirited
sketch
from
his
fingers
was
a
blank
to
their
eyes;
the
most
original
observation
from
his
lips
fell
unheard
on
their
ears.
Nothing
could
exceed
the
propriety
of
their
behaviour.
I
should
have
said
nothing
could
have
equalled
it;
but
I
remember
a
fact
which
strangely
astonished
Caroline
Helstone.
It
was
to
discover
that
her
cousin
had
absolutely
no
sympathizing
friend
at
Fieldhead;
that
to
Miss
Keeldar
he
was
as
much
a
mere
teacher,
as
little
a
gentleman,
as
little
a
man,
as
to
the
estimable
Misses
Sympson.
What
had
befallen
the
kind
hearted
Shirley
that
she
should
be
so
indifferent
to
the
dreary
position
of
a
fellow
creature
thus
isolated
under
her
roof?
She
was
not,
perhaps,
haughty
to
him,
but
she
never
noticed
him
she
let
him
alone.
He
came
and
went,
spoke
or
was
silent,
and
she
rarely
recognized
his
existence.
As
to
Louis
Moore
himself,
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
used
to
this
life,
and
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
bear
it
for
a
time.
His
faculties
seemed
walled
up
in
him,
and
were
unmurmuring
in
their
captivity.
He
never
laughed;
he
seldom
smiled;
he
was
uncomplaining.
He
fulfilled
the
round
of
his
duties
scrupulously.
His
pupil
loved
him;
he
asked
nothing
more
than
civility
from
the
rest
of
the
world.
It
even
appeared
that
he
would
accept
nothing
more
in
that
abode
at
least;
for
when
his
cousin
Caroline
made
gentle
overtures
of
friendship,
he
did
not
encourage
them
he
rather
avoided
than
sought
her.
One
living
thing
alone,
besides
his
pale,
crippled
scholar,
he
fondled
in
the
house,
and
that
was
the
ruffianly
Tartar,
who,
sullen
and
impracticable
to
others,
acquired
a
singular
partiality
for
him
a
partiality
so
marked
that
sometimes,
when
Moore,
summoned
to
a
meal,
entered
the
room
and
sat
down
unwelcomed,
Tartar
would
rise
from
his
lair
at
Shirley's
feet
and
betake
himself
to
the
taciturn
tutor.
Once
but
once
she
noticed
the
desertion,
and
holding
out
her
white
hand,
and
speaking
softly,
tried
to
coax
him
back.
Tartar
looked,
slavered,
and
sighed,
as
his
manner
was,
but
yet
