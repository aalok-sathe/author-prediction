my
superior."
"Did
you
ever
meet
him?"
"I
should
be
glad
to
see
him
any
day.
The
higher
above
me,
so
much
the
better.
It
degrades
to
stoop;
it
is
glorious
to
look
up.
What
frets
me
is,
that
when
I
try
to
esteem,
I
am
baffled;
when
religiously
inclined,
there
are
but
false
gods
to
adore.
I
disdain
to
be
a
pagan."
"Miss
Keeldar,
will
you
come
in?
We
are
here
at
the
rectory
gates."
"Not
to
day,
but
to
morrow
I
shall
fetch
you
to
spend
the
evening
with
me.
Caroline
Helstone,
if
you
really
are
what
at
present
to
me
you
seem,
you
and
I
will
suit.
I
have
never
in
my
whole
life
been
able
to
talk
to
a
young
lady
as
I
have
talked
to
you
this
morning.
Kiss
me
and
good
bye."
Mrs.
Pryor
seemed
as
well
disposed
to
cultivate
Caroline's
acquaintance
as
Shirley.
She,
who
went
nowhere
else,
called
on
an
early
day
at
the
rectory.
She
came
in
the
afternoon,
when
the
rector
happened
to
be
out.
It
was
rather
a
close
day;
the
heat
of
the
weather
had
flushed
her,
and
she
seemed
fluttered
too
by
the
circumstance
of
entering
a
strange
house,
for
it
appeared
her
habits
were
most
retiring
and
secluded.
When
Miss
Helstone
went
to
her
in
the
dining
room
she
found
her
seated
on
the
sofa,
trembling,
fanning
herself
with
her
handkerchief,
and
seeming
to
contend
with
a
nervous
discomposure
that
threatened
to
become
hysterical.
Caroline
marvelled
somewhat
at
this
unusual
want
of
self
command
in
a
lady
of
her
years,
and
also
at
the
lack
of
real
strength
in
one
who
appeared
almost
robust
for
Mrs.
Pryor
hastened
to
allege
the
fatigue
of
her
walk,
the
heat
of
the
sun,
etc.,
as
reasons
for
her
temporary
indisposition;
and
still
as,
with
more
hurry
than
coherence,
she
again
and
again
enumerated
these
causes
of
exhaustion,
Caroline
gently
sought
to
relieve
her
by
opening
her
shawl
and
removing
her
bonnet.
Attentions
of
this
sort
Mrs.
Pryor
would
not
have
accepted
from
every
one.
In
general
she
recoiled
from
touch
or
close
approach
with
a
mixture
of
embarrassment
and
coldness
far
from
flattering
to
those
who
offered
her
aid.
To
Miss
Helstone's
little
light
hand,
however,
she
yielded
tractably,
and
seemed
soothed
by
its
contact.
In
a
few
minutes
she
ceased
to
tremble,
and
grew
quiet
and
tranquil.
Her
usual
manner
being
resumed,
she
proceeded
to
talk
of
ordinary
topics.
In
a
miscellaneous
company
Mrs.
Pryor
rarely
opened
her
lips,
or,
if
obliged
to
speak,
she
spoke
under
restraint,
and
consequently
not
well;
in
dialogue
she
was
a
good
converser.
Her
language,
always
a
little
formal,
was
well
chosen;
her
sentiments
were
just;
her
information
was
varied
and
correct.
Caroline
felt
it
pleasant
to
listen
to
her,
more
pleasant
than
she
could
have
anticipated.
On
the
wall
opposite
the
sofa
where
they
sat
hung
three
pictures
the
centre
one,
above
the
mantelpiece,
that
of
a
lady;
the
two
others,
