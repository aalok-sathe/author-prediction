(you
cannot
know
how
it
happened,
reader;
your
curiosity
must
be
robbed
to
pay
your
elegant
love
of
the
pretty
and
pleasing),
there
came
as
his
successor
another
Irish
curate,
Mr.
Macarthey.
I
am
happy
to
be
able
to
inform
you,
with
truth,
that
this
gentleman
did
as
much
credit
to
his
country
as
Malone
had
done
it
discredit.
He
proved
himself
as
decent,
decorous,
and
conscientious
as
Peter
was
rampant,
boisterous,
and
This
last
epithet
I
choose
to
suppress,
because
it
would
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag.
He
laboured
faithfully
in
the
parish.
The
schools,
both
Sunday
and
day
schools,
flourished
under
his
sway
like
green
bay
trees.
Being
human,
of
course
he
had
his
faults.
These,
however,
were
proper,
steady
going,
clerical
faults
what
many
would
call
virtues.
The
circumstance
of
finding
himself
invited
to
tea
with
a
Dissenter
would
unhinge
him
for
a
week.
The
spectacle
of
a
Quaker
wearing
his
hat
in
the
church,
the
thought
of
an
unbaptized
fellow
creature
being
interred
with
Christian
rites
these
things
could
make
strange
havoc
in
Mr.
Macarthey's
physical
and
mental
economy.
Otherwise
he
was
sane
and
rational,
diligent
and
charitable.
I
doubt
not
a
justice
loving
public
will
have
remarked,
ere
this,
that
I
have
thus
far
shown
a
criminal
remissness
in
pursuing,
catching,
and
bringing
to
condign
punishment
the
would
be
assassin
of
Mr.
Robert
Moore.
Here
was
a
fine
opening
to
lead
my
willing
readers
a
dance,
at
once
decorous
and
exciting
a
dance
of
law
and
gospel,
of
the
dungeon,
the
dock,
and
the
"dead
thraw."
You
might
have
liked
it,
reader,
but
I
should
not.
I
and
my
subject
would
presently
have
quarrelled,
and
then
I
should
have
broken
down.
I
was
happy
to
find
that
facts
perfectly
exonerated
me
from
the
attempt.
The
murderer
was
never
punished,
for
the
good
reason
that
he
was
never
caught
the
result
of
the
further
circumstance
that
he
was
never
pursued.
The
magistrates
made
a
shuffling,
as
if
they
were
going
to
rise
and
do
valiant
things;
but
since
Moore
himself,
instead
of
urging
and
leading
them
as
heretofore,
lay
still
on
his
little
cottage
couch,
laughing
in
his
sleeve,
and
sneering
with
every
feature
of
his
pale,
foreign
face,
they
considered
better
of
it,
and
after
fulfilling
certain
indispensable
forms,
prudently
resolved
to
let
the
matter
quietly
drop,
which
they
did.
Mr.
Moore
knew
who
had
shot
him,
and
all
Briarfield
knew.
It
was
no
other
than
Michael
Hartley,
the
half
crazed
weaver
once
before
alluded
to,
a
frantic
Antinomian
in
religion,
and
a
mad
leveller
in
politics.
The
poor
soul
died
of
delirium
tremens
a
year
after
the
attempt
on
Moore,
and
Robert
gave
his
wretched
widow
a
guinea
to
bury
him.
The
winter
is
over
and
gone;
spring
has
followed
with
beamy
and
shadowy,
with
flowery
and
showery
flight.
We
are
now
in
the
heart
of
summer
in
mid
June
the
June
of
1812.
It
is
burning
weather.
The
air
is
deep
