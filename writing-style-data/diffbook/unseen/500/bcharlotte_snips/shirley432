her.
The
sense
of
her
value
is
here,
in
my
heart;
the
necessity
for
her
society
is
blended
with
my
life.
Not
more
jealous
shall
I
be
of
the
blood
whose
flow
moves
my
pulses
than
of
her
happiness
and
well
being."
"I
love
you,
too,
Robert,
and
will
take
faithful
care
of
you."
"Will
you
take
faithful
care
of
me?
Faithful
care!
As
if
that
rose
should
promise
to
shelter
from
tempest
this
hard
gray
stone!
But
she
will
care
for
me,
in
her
way.
These
hands
will
be
the
gentle
ministrants
of
every
comfort
I
can
taste.
I
know
the
being
I
seek
to
entwine
with
my
own
will
bring
me
a
solace,
a
charity,
a
purity,
to
which,
of
myself,
I
am
a
stranger."
Suddenly
Caroline
was
troubled;
her
lip
quivered.
"What
flutters
my
dove?"
asked
Moore,
as
she
nestled
to
and
then
uneasily
shrank
from
him.
"Poor
mamma!
I
am
all
mamma
has.
Must
I
leave
her?"
"Do
you
know,
I
thought
of
that
difficulty.
I
and
'mamma'
have
discussed
it."
"Tell
me
what
you
wish,
what
you
would
like,
and
I
will
consider
if
it
is
possible
to
consent.
But
I
cannot
desert
her,
even
for
you.
I
cannot
break
her
heart,
even
for
your
sake."
"She
was
faithful
when
I
was
false
was
she
not?
I
never
came
near
your
sick
bed,
and
she
watched
it
ceaselessly."
"What
must
I
do?
Anything
but
leave
her."
"At
my
wish
you
never
shall
leave
her."
"She
may
live
very
near
us?"
"With
us
only
she
will
have
her
own
rooms
and
servant.
For
this
she
stipulates
herself."
"You
know
she
has
an
income,
that,
with
her
habits,
makes
her
quite
independent?"
"She
told
me
that,
with
a
gentle
pride
that
reminded
me
of
somebody
else."
"She
is
not
at
all
interfering,
and
incapable
of
gossip."
"I
know
her,
Cary.
But
if,
instead
of
being
the
personification
of
reserve
and
discretion,
she
were
something
quite
opposite,
I
should
not
fear
her."
"Yet
she
will
be
your
mother
in
law?"
The
speaker
gave
an
arch
little
nod.
Moore
smiled.
"Louis
and
I
are
not
of
the
order
of
men
who
fear
their
mothers
in
law,
Cary.
Our
foes
never
have
been,
nor
will
be,
those
of
our
own
household.
I
doubt
not
my
mother
in
law
will
make
much
of
me."
"That
she
will
in
her
quiet
way,
you
know.
She
is
not
demonstrative;
and
when
you
see
her
silent,
or
even
cool,
you
must
not
fancy
her
displeased;
it
is
only
a
manner
she
has.
Be
sure
to
let
me
interpret
for
her
whenever
she
puzzles
you;
always
believe
my
account
of
the
matter,
Robert."
"Oh,
implicitly!
Jesting
apart,
I
feel
that
she
and
I
will
suit
on
ne
peut
mieux.
Hortense,
you
know,
is
exquisitely
susceptible
in
our
French
sense
of
the
word
and
not,
perhaps,
always
reasonable
in
her
requirements;
yet,
dear,
honest
girl,
I
never
painfully
wounded
her
feelings
or
had
a
serious
quarrel
