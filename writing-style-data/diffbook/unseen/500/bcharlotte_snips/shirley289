me
words
one
night;
it
poured
a
strain
which
I
could
have
written
down,
only
I
was
appalled,
and
dared
not
rise
to
seek
pencil
and
paper
by
the
dim
watch
light.
"What
is
that
electricity
they
speak
of,
whose
changes
make
us
well
or
ill,
whose
lack
or
excess
blasts,
whose
even
balance
revives?
What
are
all
those
influences
that
are
about
us
in
the
atmosphere,
that
keep
playing
over
our
nerves
like
fingers
on
stringed
instruments,
and
call
forth
now
a
sweet
note,
and
now
a
wail
now
an
exultant
swell,
and
anon
the
saddest
cadence?
"Where
is
the
other
world?
In
what
will
another
life
consist?
Why
do
I
ask?
Have
I
not
cause
to
think
that
the
hour
is
hasting
but
too
fast
when
the
veil
must
be
rent
for
me?
Do
I
not
know
the
Grand
Mystery
is
likely
to
burst
prematurely
on
me?
Great
Spirit,
in
whose
goodness
I
confide,
whom,
as
my
Father,
I
have
petitioned
night
and
morning
from
early
infancy,
help
the
weak
creation
of
Thy
hands!
Sustain
me
through
the
ordeal
I
dread
and
must
undergo!
Give
me
strength!
Give
me
patience!
Give
me
oh,
give
me
FAITH!"
She
fell
back
on
her
pillow.
Mrs.
Pryor
found
means
to
steal
quietly
from
the
room.
She
re
entered
it
soon
after,
apparently
as
composed
as
if
she
had
really
not
overheard
this
strange
soliloquy.
The
next
day
several
callers
came.
It
had
become
known
that
Miss
Helstone
was
worse.
Mr.
Hall
and
his
sister
Margaret
arrived.
Both,
after
they
had
been
in
the
sickroom,
quitted
it
in
tears;
they
had
found
the
patient
more
altered
than
they
expected.
Hortense
Moore
came.
Caroline
seemed
stimulated
by
her
presence.
She
assured
her,
smiling,
she
was
not
dangerously
ill;
she
talked
to
her
in
a
low
voice,
but
cheerfully.
During
her
stay,
excitement
kept
up
the
flush
of
her
complexion;
she
looked
better.
"How
is
Mr.
Robert?"
asked
Mrs.
Pryor,
as
Hortense
was
preparing
to
take
leave.
"He
was
very
well
when
he
left."
"Left!
Is
he
gone
from
home?"
It
was
then
explained
that
some
police
intelligence
about
the
rioters
of
whom
he
was
in
pursuit
had,
that
morning,
called
him
away
to
Birmingham,
and
probably
a
fortnight
might
elapse
ere
he
returned.
"He
is
not
aware
that
Miss
Helstone
is
very
ill?"
"Oh
no!
He
thought,
like
me,
that
she
had
only
a
bad
cold."
After
this
visit,
Mrs.
Pryor
took
care
not
to
approach
Caroline's
couch
for
above
an
hour.
She
heard
her
weep,
and
dared
not
look
on
her
tears.
As
evening
closed
in,
she
brought
her
some
tea.
Caroline,
opening
her
eyes
from
a
moment's
slumber,
viewed
her
nurse
with
an
unrecognizing
glance.
"I
smelt
the
honeysuckles
in
the
glen
this
summer
morning,"
she
said,
"as
I
stood
at
the
counting
house
window."
Strange
words
like
these
from
pallid
lips
pierce
a
loving
listener's
heart
more
poignantly
than
steel.
They
sound
romantic,
perhaps,
in
books;
in
real
life
they
