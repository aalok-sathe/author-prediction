He
would
have
shown
some
token
of
affection.
In
his
eye,
on
his
lips,
I
should
have
read
comfort;
but
the
chance
is
lost.
The
wind,
the
cloud's
shadow,
does
not
pass
more
silently,
more
emptily
than
he.
I
have
been
mocked,
and
Heaven
is
cruel!"
Thus,
in
the
utter
sickness
of
longing
and
disappointment,
she
went
home.
The
next
morning
at
breakfast,
where
she
appeared
white
cheeked
and
miserable
looking
as
one
who
had
seen
a
ghost,
she
inquired
of
Mr.
Helstone,
"Have
you
any
objection,
uncle,
to
my
inquiring
for
a
situation
in
a
family?"
Her
uncle,
ignorant
as
the
table
supporting
his
coffee
cup
of
all
his
niece
had
undergone
and
was
undergoing,
scarcely
believed
his
ears.
"What
whim
now?"
he
asked.
"Are
you
bewitched?
What
can
you
mean?"
"I
am
not
well,
and
need
a
change,"
she
said.
He
examined
her.
He
discovered
she
had
experienced
a
change,
at
any
rate.
Without
his
being
aware
of
it,
the
rose
had
dwindled
and
faded
to
a
mere
snowdrop;
bloom
had
vanished,
flesh
wasted;
she
sat
before
him
drooping,
colourless,
and
thin.
But
for
the
soft
expression
of
her
brown
eyes,
the
delicate
lines
of
her
features,
and
the
flowing
abundance
of
her
hair,
she
would
no
longer
have
possessed
a
claim
to
the
epithet
pretty.
"What
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
you?"
he
asked.
"What
is
wrong?
How
are
you
ailing?"
No
answer;
only
the
brown
eyes
filled,
the
faintly
tinted
lips
trembled.
"Look
out
for
a
situation,
indeed!
For
what
situation
are
you
fit?
What
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself?
You
are
not
well."
"I
should
be
well
if
I
went
from
home."
"These
women
are
incomprehensible.
They
have
the
strangest
knack
of
startling
you
with
unpleasant
surprises.
To
day
you
see
them
bouncing,
buxom,
red
as
cherries,
and
round
as
apples;
to
morrow
they
exhibit
themselves
effete
as
dead
weeds,
blanched
and
broken
down.
And
the
reason
of
it
all?
That's
the
puzzle.
She
has
her
meals,
her
liberty,
a
good
house
to
live
in,
and
good
clothes
to
wear,
as
usual.
A
while
since
that
sufficed
to
keep
her
handsome
and
cheery,
and
there
she
sits
now
a
poor,
little,
pale,
puling
chit
enough.
Provoking!
Then
comes
the
question,
What
is
to
be
done?
I
suppose
I
must
send
for
advice.
Will
you
have
a
doctor,
child?"
"No,
uncle,
I
don't
want
one.
A
doctor
could
do
me
no
good.
I
merely
want
change
of
air
and
scene."
"Well,
if
that
be
the
caprice,
it
shall
be
gratified.
You
shall
go
to
a
watering
place.
I
don't
mind
the
expense.
Fanny
shall
accompany
you."
"But,
uncle,
some
day
I
must
do
something
for
myself;
I
have
no
fortune.
I
had
better
begin
now."
"While
I
live,
you
shall
not
turn
out
as
a
governess,
Caroline.
I
will
not
have
it
said
that
my
niece
is
a
governess."
"But
the
later
in
life
one
makes
a
change
of
that
sort,
uncle,
the
