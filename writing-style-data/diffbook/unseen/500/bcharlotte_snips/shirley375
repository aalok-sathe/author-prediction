narrow
rules,
your
little
prejudices,
aversions,
dogmas,
bundle
them
off.
Mr.
Sympson,
go,
offer
them
a
sacrifice
to
the
deity
you
worship;
I'll
none
of
them.
I
wash
my
hands
of
the
lot.
I
walk
by
another
creed,
light,
faith,
and
hope
than
you."
"Another
creed!
I
believe
she
is
an
infidel."
"An
infidel
to
your
religion,
an
atheist
to
your
god."
"An
atheist!!!"
"Your
god,
sir,
is
the
world.
In
my
eyes
you
too,
if
not
an
infidel,
are
an
idolater.
I
conceive
that
you
ignorantly
worship;
in
all
things
you
appear
to
me
too
superstitious.
Sir,
your
god,
your
great
Bel,
your
fish
tailed
Dagon,
rises
before
me
as
a
demon.
You,
and
such
as
you,
have
raised
him
to
a
throne,
put
on
him
a
crown,
given
him
a
sceptre.
Behold
how
hideously
he
governs!
See
him
busied
at
the
work
he
likes
best
making
marriages.
He
binds
the
young
to
the
old,
the
strong
to
the
imbecile.
He
stretches
out
the
arm
of
Mezentius,
and
fetters
the
dead
to
the
living.
In
his
realm
there
is
hatred
secret
hatred;
there
is
disgust
unspoken
disgust;
there
is
treachery
family
treachery;
there
is
vice
deep,
deadly
domestic
vice.
In
his
dominions
children
grow
unloving
between
parents
who
have
never
loved;
infants
are
nursed
on
deception
from
their
very
birth;
they
are
reared
in
an
atmosphere
corrupt
with
lies.
Your
god
rules
at
the
bridal
of
kings;
look
at
your
royal
dynasties!
Your
deity
is
the
deity
of
foreign
aristocracies;
analyze
the
blue
blood
of
Spain!
Your
god
is
the
Hymen
of
France;
what
is
French
domestic
life?
All
that
surrounds
him
hastens
to
decay;
all
declines
and
degenerates
under
his
sceptre.
Your
god
is
a
masked
Death."
"This
language
is
terrible!
My
daughters
and
you
must
associate
no
longer,
Miss
Keeldar;
there
is
danger
in
such
companionship.
Had
I
known
you
a
little
earlier
but,
extraordinary
as
I
thought
you,
I
could
not
have
believed
"
"Now,
sir,
do
you
begin
to
be
aware
that
it
is
useless
to
scheme
for
me;
that
in
doing
so
you
but
sow
the
wind
to
reap
the
whirlwind?
I
sweep
your
cobweb
projects
from
my
path,
that
I
may
pass
on
unsullied.
I
am
anchored
on
a
resolve
you
cannot
shake.
My
heart,
my
conscience
shall
dispose
of
my
hand
they
only.
Know
this
at
last."
Mr.
Sympson
was
becoming
a
little
bewildered.
"Never
heard
such
language!"
he
muttered
again
and
again;
"never
was
so
addressed
in
my
life
never
was
so
used!"
"You
are
quite
confused,
sir.
You
had
better
withdraw,
or
I
will."
He
rose
hastily.
"We
must
leave
this
place;
they
must
pack
up
at
once."
"Do
not
hurry
my
aunt
and
cousins;
give
them
time."
"No
more
intercourse;
she's
not
proper."
He
made
his
way
to
the
door.
He
came
back
for
his
handkerchief.
He
dropped
his
snuff
box,
leaving
the
contents
scattered
on
the
carpet;
he
stumbled
out.
Tartar
lay
outside
across
the
mat;
Mr.
Sympson
