a
day,
not
for
an
hour.
I
would
rebel
break
from
him
defy
him."
"Are
you
not
enough
to
bewilder
one's
brain
with
your
self
contradiction?"
"It
is
evident
I
bewilder
your
brain."
"You
talk
of
Sir
Philip
being
young.
He
is
two
and
twenty."
"My
husband
must
be
thirty,
with
the
sense
of
forty."
"You
had
better
pick
out
some
old
man
some
white
headed
or
bald
headed
swain."
"No,
thank
you."
"You
could
lead
some
doting
fool;
you
might
pin
him
to
your
apron."
"I
might
do
that
with
a
boy;
but
it
is
not
my
vocation.
Did
I
not
say
I
prefer
a
master
one
in
whose
presence
I
shall
feel
obliged
and
disposed
to
be
good;
one
whose
control
my
impatient
temper
must
acknowledge;
a
man
whose
approbation
can
reward,
whose
displeasure
punish
me;
a
man
I
shall
feel
it
impossible
not
to
love,
and
very
possible
to
fear?"
"What
is
there
to
hinder
you
from
doing
all
this
with
Sir
Philip?
He
is
a
baronet
a
man
of
rank,
property,
connections
far
above
yours.
If
you
talk
of
intellect,
he
is
a
poet
he
writes
verses;
which
you,
I
take
it,
cannot
do,
with
all
your
cleverness."
"Neither
his
title,
wealth,
pedigree,
nor
poetry
avail
to
invest
him
with
the
power
I
describe.
These
are
feather
weights;
they
want
ballast.
A
measure
of
sound,
solid,
practical
sense
would
have
stood
him
in
better
stead
with
me."
"You
and
Henry
rave
about
poetry!
You
used
to
catch
fire
like
tinder
on
the
subject
when
you
were
a
girl."
"O
uncle,
there
is
nothing
really
valuable
in
this
world,
there
is
nothing
glorious
in
the
world
to
come
that
is
not
poetry!"
"Marry
a
poet,
then,
in
God's
name!"
"Show
him
me,
and
I
will."
"Sir
Philip."
"Not
at
all.
You
are
almost
as
good
a
poet
as
he."
"Madam,
you
are
wandering
from
the
point."
"Indeed,
uncle,
I
wanted
to
do
so,
and
I
shall
be
glad
to
lead
you
away
with
me.
Do
not
let
us
get
out
of
temper
with
each
other;
it
is
not
worth
while."
"Out
of
temper,
Miss
Keeldar!
I
should
be
glad
to
know
who
is
out
of
temper."
"I
am
not,
yet."
"If
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
I
am,
I
consider
that
you
are
guilty
of
impertinence."
"You
will
be
soon,
if
you
go
on
at
that
rate."
"There
it
is!
With
your
pert
tongue
you
would
try
the
patience
of
a
Job."
"I
know
I
should."
"No
levity,
miss!
This
is
not
a
laughing
matter.
It
is
an
affair
I
am
resolved
to
probe
thoroughly,
convinced
that
there
is
mischief
at
the
bottom.
You
described
just
now,
with
far
too
much
freedom
for
your
years
and
sex,
the
sort
of
individual
you
would
prefer
as
a
husband.
Pray,
did
you
paint
from
the
life?"
Shirley
opened
her
lips,
but
instead
of
speaking
she
only
glowed
rose
red.
"I
shall
have
an
answer
to
that
question,"
affirmed
Mr.
