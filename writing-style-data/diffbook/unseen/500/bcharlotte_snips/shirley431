him,
however.
He
has
had
a
stormy
courtship
for
such
a
calm
character;
but
you
see
it
all
ends
in
victory
for
him.
Caroline,
I
have
sought
you
to
ask
an
audience.
Why
are
those
bells
ringing?"
"For
the
repeal
of
your
terrible
law
the
Orders
you
hate
so
much.
You
are
pleased,
are
you
not?"
"Yesterday
evening
at
this
time
I
was
packing
some
books
for
a
sea
voyage.
They
were
the
only
possessions,
except
some
clothes,
seeds,
roots,
and
tools,
which
I
felt
free
to
take
with
me
to
Canada.
I
was
going
to
leave
you."
"To
leave
me?
To
leave
me?"
Her
little
fingers
fastened
on
his
arm;
she
spoke
and
looked
affrighted.
"Not
now
not
now.
Examine
my
face
yes,
look
at
me
well.
Is
the
despair
of
parting
legible
thereon?"
She
looked
into
an
illuminated
countenance,
whose
characters
were
all
beaming,
though
the
page
itself
was
dusk.
This
face,
potent
in
the
majesty
of
its
traits,
shed
down
on
her
hope,
fondness,
delight.
"Will
the
repeal
do
you
good
much
good,
immediate
good?"
she
inquired.
"The
repeal
of
the
Orders
in
Council
saves
me.
Now
I
shall
not
turn
bankrupt;
now
I
shall
not
give
up
business;
now
I
shall
not
leave
England;
now
I
shall
be
no
longer
poor;
now
I
can
pay
my
debts;
now
all
the
cloth
I
have
in
my
warehouses
will
be
taken
off
my
hands,
and
commissions
given
me
for
much
more.
This
day
lays
for
my
fortunes
a
broad,
firm
foundation,
on
which,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
can
securely
build."
Caroline
devoured
his
words;
she
held
his
hand
in
hers;
she
drew
a
long
breath.
"You
are
saved?
Your
heavy
difficulties
are
lifted?"
"They
are
lifted.
I
breathe.
I
can
act."
"At
last!
Oh,
Providence
is
kind!
Thank
Him,
Robert."
"I
do
thank
Providence."
"And
I
also,
for
your
sake!"
She
looked
up
devoutly.
"Now
I
can
take
more
workmen,
give
better
wages,
lay
wiser
and
more
liberal
plans,
do
some
good,
be
less
selfish.
Now,
Caroline,
I
can
have
a
house
a
home
which
I
can
truly
call
mine
and
now
"
He
paused,
for
his
deep
voice
was
checked.
"And
now,"
he
resumed
"now
I
can
think
of
marriage,
now
I
can
seek
a
wife."
This
was
no
moment
for
her
to
speak.
She
did
not
speak.
"Will
Caroline,
who
meekly
hopes
to
be
forgiven
as
she
forgives
will
she
pardon
all
I
have
made
her
suffer,
all
that
long
pain
I
have
wickedly
caused
her,
all
that
sickness
of
body
and
mind
she
owed
to
me?
Will
she
forget
what
she
knows
of
my
poor
ambition,
my
sordid
schemes?
Will
she
let
me
expiate
these
things?
Will
she
suffer
me
to
prove
that,
as
I
once
deserted
cruelly,
trifled
wantonly,
injured
basely,
I
can
now
love
faithfully,
cherish
fondly,
treasure
tenderly?"
His
hand
was
in
Caroline's
still;
a
gentle
pressure
answered
him.
"Is
Caroline
mine?"
"Caroline
is
yours."
"I
will
prize
