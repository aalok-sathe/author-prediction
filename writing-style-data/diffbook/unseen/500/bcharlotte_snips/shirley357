party,
and
took
the
road.
In
less
than
five
minutes
Mr.
Yorke
followed
him.
They
rode
out
of
Stilbro'
together.
It
was
early
to
go
home,
but
yet
it
was
late
in
the
day.
The
last
ray
of
the
sun
had
already
faded
from
the
cloud
edges,
and
the
October
night
was
casting
over
the
moorlands
the
shadow
of
her
approach.
Mr.
Yorke,
moderately
exhilarated
with
his
moderate
libations,
and
not
displeased
to
see
young
Moore
again
in
Yorkshire,
and
to
have
him
for
his
comrade
during
the
long
ride
home,
took
the
discourse
much
to
himself.
He
touched
briefly,
but
scoffingly,
on
the
trials
and
the
conviction;
he
passed
thence
to
the
gossip
of
the
neighbourhood,
and
ere
long
he
attacked
Moore
on
his
own
personal
concerns.
"Bob,
I
believe
you
are
worsted,
and
you
deserve
it.
All
was
smooth.
Fortune
had
fallen
in
love
with
you.
She
had
decreed
you
the
first
prize
in
her
wheel
twenty
thousand
pounds;
she
only
required
that
you
should
hold
your
hand
out
and
take
it.
And
what
did
you
do?
You
called
for
a
horse
and
rode
a
hunting
to
Warwickshire.
Your
sweetheart
Fortune,
I
mean
was
perfectly
indulgent.
She
said,
'I'll
excuse
him;
he's
young.'
She
waited,
like
'Patience
on
a
monument,'
till
the
chase
was
over
and
the
vermin
prey
run
down.
She
expected
you
would
come
back
then,
and
be
a
good
lad.
You
might
still
have
had
her
first
prize.
"It
capped
her
beyond
expression,
and
me
too,
to
find
that,
instead
of
thundering
home
in
a
breakneck
gallop
and
laying
your
assize
laurels
at
her
feet,
you
coolly
took
coach
up
to
London.
What
you
have
done
there
Satan
knows;
nothing
in
this
world,
I
believe,
but
sat
and
sulked.
Your
face
was
never
lily
fair,
but
it
is
olive
green
now.
You're
not
as
bonny
as
you
were,
man."
"And
who
is
to
have
this
prize
you
talk
so
much
about?"
"Only
a
baronet;
that
is
all.
I
have
not
a
doubt
in
my
own
mind
you've
lost
her.
She
will
be
Lady
Nunnely
before
Christmas."
"Hem!
Quite
probable."
"But
she
need
not
to
have
been.
Fool
of
a
lad!
I
swear
you
might
have
had
her."
"By
what
token,
Mr.
Yorke?"
"By
every
token
by
the
light
of
her
eyes,
the
red
of
her
cheeks.
Red
they
grew
when
your
name
was
mentioned,
though
of
custom
they
are
pale."
"My
chance
is
quite
over,
I
suppose?"
"It
ought
to
be.
But
try;
it
is
worth
trying.
I
call
this
Sir
Philip
milk
and
water.
And
then
he
writes
verses,
they
say
tags
rhymes.
You
are
above
that,
Bob,
at
all
events."
"Would
you
advise
me
to
propose,
late
as
it
is,
Mr.
Yorke
at
the
eleventh
hour?"
"You
can
but
make
the
experiment,
Robert.
If
she
has
a
fancy
for
you
and,
on
my
conscience,
I
believe
she
has
or
had
she
will
forgive
much.
But,
my
lad,
you
are
laughing.
Is
it
at
