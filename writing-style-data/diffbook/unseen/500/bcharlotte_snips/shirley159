companion
turned
into
a
path
that
lay
nearer
the
gate.
Some
of
their
conversation
became
audible.
Caroline
would
not
stay
to
listen.
She
passed
away
noiselessly,
and
the
moonlight
kissed
the
wall
which
her
shadow
had
dimmed.
The

is
privileged
to
remain,
and
try
what
he
can
make
of
the
discourse.
"I
cannot
conceive
why
nature
did
not
give
you
a
bulldog's
head,
for
you
have
all
a
bulldog's
tenacity,"
said
Shirley.
"Not
a
flattering
idea.
Am
I
so
ignoble?"
"And
something
also
you
have
of
the
same
animal's
silent
ways
of
going
about
its
work.
You
give
no
warning;
you
come
noiselessly
behind,
seize
fast,
and
hold
on."
"This
is
guess
work.
You
have
witnessed
no
such
feat
on
my
part.
In
your
presence
I
have
been
no
bulldog."
"Your
very
silence
indicates
your
race.
How
little
you
talk
in
general,
yet
how
deeply
you
scheme!
You
are
far
seeing;
you
are
calculating."
"I
know
the
ways
of
these
people.
I
have
gathered
information
of
their
intentions.
My
note
last
night
informed
you
that
Barraclough's
trial
had
ended
in
his
conviction
and
sentence
to
transportation.
His
associates
will
plot
vengeance.
I
shall
lay
my
plans
so
as
to
counteract
or
at
least
be
prepared
for
theirs
that
is
all.
Having
now
given
you
as
clear
an
explanation
as
I
can,
am
I
to
understand
that
for
what
I
propose
doing
I
have
your
approbation?"
"I
shall
stand
by
you
so
long
as
you
remain
on
the
defensive.
Yes."
"Good!
Without
any
aid
even
opposed
or
disapproved
by
you
I
believe
I
should
have
acted
precisely
as
I
now
intend
to
act,
but
in
another
spirit.
I
now
feel
satisfied.
On
the
whole,
I
relish
the
position."
"I
dare
say
you
do.
That
is
evident.
You
relish
the
work
which
lies
before
you
still
better
than
you
would
relish
the
execution
of
a
government
order
for
army
cloth."
"I
certainly
feel
it
congenial."
"So
would
old
Helstone.
It
is
true
there
is
a
shade
of
difference
in
your
motives
many
shades,
perhaps.
Shall
I
speak
to
Mr.
Helstone?
I
will,
if
you
like."
"Act
as
you
please.
Your
judgment,
Miss
Keeldar,
will
guide
you
accurately.
I
could
rely
on
it
myself
in
a
more
difficult
crisis.
But
I
should
inform
you
Mr.
Helstone
is
somewhat
prejudiced
against
me
at
present."
"I
am
aware
I
have
heard
all
about
your
differences.
Depend
upon
it,
they
will
melt
away.
He
cannot
resist
the
temptation
of
an
alliance
under
present
circumstances."
"I
should
be
glad
to
have
him;
he
is
of
true
metal."
"I
think
so
also."
"An
old
blade,
and
rusty
somewhat,
but
the
edge
and
temper
still
excellent."
"Well,
you
shall
have
him,
Mr.
Moore
that
is,
if
I
can
win
him."
"Whom
can
you
not
win?"
"Perhaps
not
the
rector;
but
I
will
make
the
effort."
"Effort!
He
will
yield
for
a
word
a
smile."
"By
no
means.
It
will
cost
me
several
cups
of
tea,
some
toast
and
