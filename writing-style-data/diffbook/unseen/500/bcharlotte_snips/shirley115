the
robber's
throat,
and
there
they
would
have
fastened,
and
there
hung,
inveterate,
insatiable,
till
the
treasure
had
been
restored.
Tradesmen,
when
they
speak
against
war,
always
profess
to
hate
it
because
it
is
a
bloody
and
barbarous
proceeding.
You
would
think,
to
hear
them
talk,
that
they
are
peculiarly
civilized
especially
gentle
and
kindly
of
disposition
to
their
fellow
men.
This
is
not
the
case.
Many
of
them
are
extremely
narrow
and
cold
hearted;
have
no
good
feeling
for
any
class
but
their
own;
are
distant,
even
hostile,
to
all
others;
call
them
useless;
seem
to
question
their
right
to
exist;
seem
to
grudge
them
the
very
air
they
breathe,
and
to
think
the
circumstance
of
their
eating,
drinking,
and
living
in
decent
houses
quite
unjustifiable.
They
do
not
know
what
others
do
in
the
way
of
helping,
pleasing,
or
teaching
their
race;
they
will
not
trouble
themselves
to
inquire.
Whoever
is
not
in
trade
is
accused
of
eating
the
bread
of
idleness,
of
passing
a
useless
existence.
Long
may
it
be
ere
England
really
becomes
a
nation
of
shop
keepers!
We
have
already
said
that
Moore
was
no
self
sacrificing
patriot,
and
we
have
also
explained
what
circumstances
rendered
him
specially
prone
to
confine
his
attention
and
efforts
to
the
furtherance
of
his
individual
interest;
accordingly,
when
he
felt
himself
urged
a
second
time
to
the
brink
of
ruin,
none
struggled
harder
than
he
against
the
influences
which
would
have
thrust
him
over.
What
he
could
do
towards
stirring
agitation
in
the
north
against
the
war
he
did,
and
he
instigated
others
whose
money
and
connections
gave
them
more
power
than
he
possessed.
Sometimes,
by
flashes,
he
felt
there
was
little
reason
in
the
demands
his
party
made
on
Government.
When
he
heard
of
all
Europe
threatened
by
Bonaparte,
and
of
all
Europe
arming
to
resist
him;
when
he
saw
Russia
menaced,
and
beheld
Russia
rising,
incensed
and
stern,
to
defend
her
frozen
soil,
her
wild
provinces
of
serfs,
her
dark
native
despotism,
from
the
tread,
the
yoke,
the
tyranny
of
a
foreign
victor
he
knew
that
England,
a
free
realm,
could
not
then
depute
her
sons
to
make
concessions
and
propose
terms
to
the
unjust,
grasping
French
leader.
When
news
came
from
time
to
time
of
the
movements
of
that
MAN
then
representing
England
in
the
Peninsula,
of
his
advance
from
success
to
success
that
advance
so
deliberate
but
so
unswerving,
so
circumspect
but
so
certain,
so
"unhasting"
but
so
"unresting;"
when
he
read
Lord
Wellington's
own
dispatches
in
the
columns
of
the
newspapers,
documents
written
by
modesty
to
the
dictation
of
truth
Moore
confessed
at
heart
that
a
power
was
with
the
troops
of
Britain,
of
that
vigilant,
enduring,
genuine,
unostentatious
sort,
which
must
win
victory
to
the
side
it
led,
in
the
end.
In
the
end!
But
that
end,
he
thought,
was
yet
far
off;
and
meantime
he,
Moore,
as
an
individual,
would
be
crushed,
his
hopes
ground
to
dust.
It
was
himself
he
had
