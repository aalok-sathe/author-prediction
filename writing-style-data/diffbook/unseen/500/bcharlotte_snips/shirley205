real
or
imaginary,
from
his
brow.
Boultby,
in
short,
was
in
his
glory,
and
in
a
round,
sound
voix
de
poitrine
he
rumbled
out
thanks
for
attentions
and
assurances
of
his
tolerable
health.
Of
Caroline
he
took
no
manner
of
notice
as
she
came
near,
save
to
accept
what
she
offered.
He
did
not
see
her
he
never
did
see
her;
he
hardly
knew
that
such
a
person
existed.
He
saw
the
macaroons,
however,
and
being
fond
of
sweets,
possessed
himself
of
a
small
handful
thereof.
The
wine
Mrs.
Boultby
insisted
on
mingling
with
hot
water,
and
qualifying
with
sugar
and
nutmeg.
Mr.
Hall
stood
near
an
open
window,
breathing
the
fresh
air
and
scent
of
flowers,
and
talking
like
a
brother
to
Miss
Ainley.
To
him
Caroline
turned
her
attention
with
pleasure.
"What
should
she
bring
him?
He
must
not
help
himself
he
must
be
served
by
her."
And
she
provided
herself
with
a
little
salver,
that
she
might
offer
him
variety.
Margaret
Hall
joined
them;
so
did
Miss
Keeldar.
The
four
ladies
stood
round
their
favourite
pastor.
They
also
had
an
idea
that
they
looked
on
the
face
of
an
earthly
angel.
Cyril
Hall
was
their
pope,
infallible
to
them
as
Dr.
Thomas
Boultby
to
his
admirers.
A
throng,
too,
enclosed
the
rector
of
Briarfield
twenty
or
more
pressed
round
him;
and
no
parson
was
ever
more
potent
in
a
circle
than
old
Helstone.
The
curates,
herding
together
after
their
manner,
made
a
constellation
of
three
lesser
planets.
Divers
young
ladies
watched
them
afar
off,
but
ventured
not
nigh.
Mr.
Helstone
produced
his
watch.
"Ten
minutes
to
two,"
he
announced
aloud.
"Time
for
all
to
fall
into
line.
Come."
He
seized
his
shovel
hat
and
marched
away.
All
rose
and
followed
en
masse.
The
twelve
hundred
children
were
drawn
up
in
three
bodies
of
four
hundred
souls
each;
in
the
rear
of
each
regiment
was
stationed
a
band;
between
every
twenty
there
was
an
interval,
wherein
Helstone
posted
the
teachers
in
pairs.
To
the
van
of
the
armies
he
summoned,
"Grace
Boultby
and
Mary
Sykes
lead
out
Whinbury.
"Margaret
Hall
and
Mary
Ann
Ainley
conduct
Nunnely.
"Caroline
Helstone
and
Shirley
Keeldar
head
Briarfield."
Then
again
he
gave
command,
"Mr.
Donne
to
Whinbury;
Mr.
Sweeting
to
Nunnely;
Mr.
Malone
to
Briarfield."
And
these
gentlemen
stepped
up
before
the
lady
generals.
The
rectors
passed
to
the
full
front;
the
parish
clerks
fell
to
the
extreme
rear.
Helstone
lifted
his
shovel
hat.
In
an
instant
out
clashed
the
eight
bells
in
the
tower,
loud
swelled
the
sounding
bands,
flute
spoke
and
clarion
answered,
deep
rolled
the
drums,
and
away
they
marched.
The
broad
white
road
unrolled
before
the
long
procession,
the
sun
and
sky
surveyed
it
cloudless,
the
wind
tossed
the
tree
boughs
above
it,
and
the
twelve
hundred
children
and
one
hundred
and
forty
adults
of
which
it
was
composed
trod
on
in
time
and
tune,
with
gay
faces
and
glad
hearts.
It
was
a
joyous
scene,
and
a
scene
