I
never
pretend
to
understand;
and
for
the
sake
of
his
sweet
company
only
I
would
not
stir
a
step."
"But
there
is
a
chance
of
a
row;
if
a
positive
riot
does
not
take
place
of
which,
indeed,
I
see
no
signs
yet
it
is
unlikely
this
night
will
pass
quite
tranquilly.
You
know
Moore
has
resolved
to
have
new
machinery,
and
he
expects
two
wagon
loads
of
frames
and
shears
from
Stilbro'
this
evening.
Scott,
the
overlooker,
and
a
few
picked
men
are
gone
to
fetch
them."
"They
will
bring
them
in
safely
and
quietly
enough,
sir."
"Moore
says
so,
and
affirms
he
wants
nobody.
Some
one,
however,
he
must
have,
if
it
were
only
to
bear
evidence
in
case
anything
should
happen.
I
call
him
very
careless.
He
sits
in
the
counting
house
with
the
shutters
unclosed;
he
goes
out
here
and
there
after
dark,
wanders
right
up
the
hollow,
down
Fieldhead
Lane,
among
the
plantations,
just
as
if
he
were
the
darling
of
the
neighbourhood,
or
being,
as
he
is,
its
detestation
bore
a
'charmed
life,'
as
they
say
in
tale
books.
He
takes
no
warning
from
the
fate
of
Pearson,
nor
from
that
of
Armitage
shot,
one
in
his
own
house
and
the
other
on
the
moor."
"But
he
should
take
warning,
sir,
and
use
precautions
too,"
interposed
Mr.
Sweeting;
"and
I
think
he
would
if
he
heard
what
I
heard
the
other
day."
"What
did
you
hear,
Davy?"
"You
know
Mike
Hartley,
sir?"
"The
Antinomian
weaver?
Yes."
"When
Mike
has
been
drinking
for
a
few
weeks
together,
he
generally
winds
up
by
a
visit
to
Nunnely
vicarage,
to
tell
Mr.
Hall
a
piece
of
his
mind
about
his
sermons,
to
denounce
the
horrible
tendency
of
his
doctrine
of
works,
and
warn
him
that
he
and
all
his
hearers
are
sitting
in
outer
darkness."
"Well,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
Moore."
"Besides
being
an
Antinomian,
he
is
a
violent
Jacobin
and
leveller,
sir."
"I
know.
When
he
is
very
drunk,
his
mind
is
always
running
on
regicide.
Mike
is
not
unacquainted
with
history,
and
it
is
rich
to
hear
him
going
over
the
list
of
tyrants
of
whom,
as
he
says,
'the
revenger
of
blood
has
obtained
satisfaction.'
The
fellow
exults
strangely
in
murder
done
on
crowned
heads
or
on
any
head
for
political
reasons.
I
have
already
heard
it
hinted
that
he
seems
to
have
a
queer
hankering
after
Moore.
Is
that
what
you
allude
to,
Sweeting?"
"You
use
the
proper
term,
sir.
Mr.
Hall
thinks
Mike
has
no
personal
hatred
of
Moore.
Mike
says
he
even
likes
to
talk
to
him
and
run
after
him,
but
he
has
a
hankering
that
Moore
should
be
made
an
example
of.
He
was
extolling
him
to
Mr.
Hall
the
other
day
as
the
mill
owner
with
the
most
brains
in
Yorkshire,
and
for
that
reason
he
affirms
Moore
should
be
chosen
as
a
sacrifice,
an
oblation
of
a
sweet
savour.
Is
Mike
Hartley
in
his
