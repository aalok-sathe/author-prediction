fifty
you
will
not
be
repulsive."
"Miss
Mann
did
not
make
herself,
or
tune
her
voice,
Robert."
"Nature
made
her
in
the
mood
in
which
she
makes
her
briars
and
thorns;
whereas
for
the
creation
of
some
women
she
reserves
the
May
morning
hours,
when
with
light
and
dew
she
wooes
the
primrose
from
the
turf
and
the
lily
from
the
wood
moss."
Ushered
into
Miss
Mann's
little
parlour,
Caroline
found
her,
as
she
always
found
her,
surrounded
by
perfect
neatness,
cleanliness,
and
comfort
(after
all,
is
it
not
a
virtue
in
old
maids
that
solitude
rarely
makes
them
negligent
or
disorderly?)
no
dust
on
her
polished
furniture,
none
on
her
carpet,
fresh
flowers
in
the
vase
on
her
table,
a
bright
fire
in
the
grate.
She
herself
sat
primly
and
somewhat
grimly
tidy
in
a
cushioned
rocking
chair,
her
hands
busied
with
some
knitting.
This
was
her
favourite
work,
as
it
required
the
least
exertion.
She
scarcely
rose
as
Caroline
entered.
To
avoid
excitement
was
one
of
Miss
Mann's
aims
in
life.
She
had
been
composing
herself
ever
since
she
came
down
in
the
morning,
and
had
just
attained
a
certain
lethargic
state
of
tranquillity
when
the
visitor's
knock
at
the
door
startled
her,
and
undid
her
day's
work.
She
was
scarcely
pleased,
therefore,
to
see
Miss
Helstone.
She
received
her
with
reserve,
bade
her
be
seated
with
austerity,
and
when
she
got
her
placed
opposite,
she
fixed
her
with
her
eye.
This
was
no
ordinary
doom
to
be
fixed
with
Miss
Mann's
eye.
Robert
Moore
had
undergone
it
once,
and
had
never
forgotten
the
circumstance.
He
considered
it
quite
equal
to
anything
Medusa
could
do.
He
professed
to
doubt
whether,
since
that
infliction,
his
flesh
had
been
quite
what
it
was
before
whether
there
was
not
something
stony
in
its
texture.
The
gaze
had
had
such
an
effect
on
him
as
to
drive
him
promptly
from
the
apartment
and
house;
it
had
even
sent
him
straightway
up
to
the
rectory,
where
he
had
appeared
in
Caroline's
presence
with
a
very
queer
face,
and
amazed
her
by
demanding
a
cousinly
salute
on
the
spot,
to
rectify
a
damage
that
had
been
done
him.
Certainly
Miss
Mann
had
a
formidable
eye
for
one
of
the
softer
sex.
It
was
prominent,
and
showed
a
great
deal
of
the
white,
and
looked
as
steadily,
as
unwinkingly,
at
you
as
if
it
were
a
steel
ball
soldered
in
her
head;
and
when,
while
looking,
she
began
to
talk
in
an
indescribably
dry,
monotonous
tone
a
tone
without
vibration
or
inflection
you
felt
as
if
a
graven
image
of
some
bad
spirit
were
addressing
you.
But
it
was
all
a
figment
of
fancy,
a
matter
of
surface.
Miss
Mann's
goblin
grimness
scarcely
went
deeper
than
the
angel
sweetness
of
hundreds
of
beauties.
She
was
a
perfectly
honest,
conscientious
woman,
who
had
performed
duties
in
her
day
from
whose
severe
anguish
many
a
human
Peri,
gazelle
eyed,
silken
tressed,
and
silver
tongued,
would
have
shrunk
