own
feelings
were,
I
was
persuaded
you
loved
me,
Miss
Keeldar.'
"Beautiful,
was
it
not?
She
sat
quite
confounded.
'Is
it
Robert
Moore
that
speaks?'
I
heard
her
mutter.
'Is
it
a
man
or
something
lower?'
"'Do
you
mean,'
she
asked
aloud
'do
you
mean
you
thought
I
loved
you
as
we
love
those
we
wish
to
marry?'
"It
was
my
meaning,
and
I
said
so.
"'You
conceived
an
idea
obnoxious
to
a
woman's
feelings,'
was
her
answer.
'You
have
announced
it
in
a
fashion
revolting
to
a
woman's
soul.
You
insinuate
that
all
the
frank
kindness
I
have
shown
you
has
been
a
complicated,
a
bold,
and
an
immodest
maneauvre
to
ensnare
a
husband.
You
imply
that
at
last
you
come
here
out
of
pity
to
offer
me
your
hand,
because
I
have
courted
you.
Let
me
say
this:
Your
sight
is
jaundiced;
you
have
seen
wrong.
Your
mind
is
warped;
you
have
judged
wrong.
Your
tongue
betrays
you;
you
now
speak
wrong.
I
never
loved
you.
Be
at
rest
there.
My
heart
is
as
pure
of
passion
for
you
as
yours
is
barren
of
affection
for
me.'
"I
hope
I
was
answered,
Yorke?
"'I
seem
to
be
a
blind,
besotted
sort
of
person,'
was
my
remark.
"'Loved
you!'
she
cried.
'Why,
I
have
been
as
frank
with
you
as
a
sister
never
shunned
you,
never
feared
you.
You
cannot,'
she
affirmed
triumphantly
'you
cannot
make
me
tremble
with
your
coming,
nor
accelerate
my
pulse
by
your
influence.'
"I
alleged
that
often,
when
she
spoke
to
me,
she
blushed,
and
that
the
sound
of
my
name
moved
her.
"'Not
for
your
sake!'
she
declared
briefly.
I
urged
explanation,
but
could
get
none.
"'When
I
sat
beside
you
at
the
school
feast,
did
you
think
I
loved
you
then?
When
I
stopped
you
in
Maythorn
Lane,
did
you
think
I
loved
you
then?
When
I
called
on
you
in
the
counting
house,
when
I
walked
with
you
on
the
pavement,
did
you
think
I
loved
you
then?'
"So
she
questioned
me;
and
I
said
I
did.
"By
the
Lord!
Yorke,
she
rose,
she
grew
tall,
she
expanded
and
refined
almost
to
flame.
There
was
a
trembling
all
through
her,
as
in
live
coal
when
its
vivid
vermilion
is
hottest.
"'That
is
to
say
that
you
have
the
worst
opinion
of
me;
that
you
deny
me
the
possession
of
all
I
value
most.
That
is
to
say
that
I
am
a
traitor
to
all
my
sisters;
that
I
have
acted
as
no
woman
can
act
without
degrading
herself
and
her
sex;
that
I
have
sought
where
the
incorrupt
of
my
kind
naturally
scorn
and
abhor
to
seek.'
She
and
I
were
silent
for
many
a
minute.
'Lucifer,
Star
of
the
Morning,'
she
went
on,
'thou
art
fallen!
You,
once
high
in
my
esteem,
are
hurled
down;
you,
once
intimate
in
my
friendship,
are
cast
out.
Go!'
"I
went
not.
I
had
heard
her
voice
tremble,
seen
her
lip
quiver.
I
knew
