a
very
inferior
creature
and
rather
wondering
at
yourself
for
having
ever
thought
him
at
all
agreeable
before.
Do
not
you
begin
to
feel
that
now?
Were
not
you
struck?
I
am
sure
you
must
have
been
struck
by
his
awkward
look
and
abrupt
manner,
and
the
uncouthness
of
a
voice
which
I
heard
to
be
wholly
unmodulated
as
I
stood
here."
"Certainly,
he
is
not
like
Mr.
Knightley.
He
has
not
such
a
fine
air
and
way
of
walking
as
Mr.
Knightley.
I
see
the
difference
plain
enough.
But
Mr.
Knightley
is
so
very
fine
a
man!"
"Mr.
Knightley's
air
is
so
remarkably
good
that
it
is
not
fair
to
compare
Mr.
Martin
with
him.
You
might
not
see
one
in
a
hundred
with
gentleman
so
plainly
written
as
in
Mr.
Knightley.
But
he
is
not
the
only
gentleman
you
have
been
lately
used
to.
What
say
you
to
Mr.
Weston
and
Mr.
Elton?
Compare
Mr.
Martin
with
either
of
them.
Compare
their
manner
of
carrying
themselves;
of
walking;
of
speaking;
of
being
silent.
You
must
see
the
difference."
"Oh
yes!
there
is
a
great
difference.
But
Mr.
Weston
is
almost
an
old
man.
Mr.
Weston
must
be
between
forty
and
fifty."
"Which
makes
his
good
manners
the
more
valuable.
The
older
a
person
grows,
Harriet,
the
more
important
it
is
that
their
manners
should
not
be
bad;
the
more
glaring
and
disgusting
any
loudness,
or
coarseness,
or
awkwardness
becomes.
What
is
passable
in
youth
is
detestable
in
later
age.
Mr.
Martin
is
now
awkward
and
abrupt;
what
will
he
be
at
Mr.
Weston's
time
of
life?"
"There
is
no
saying,
indeed,"
replied
Harriet
rather
solemnly.
"But
there
may
be
pretty
good
guessing.
He
will
be
a
completely
gross,
vulgar
farmer,
totally
inattentive
to
appearances,
and
thinking
of
nothing
but
profit
and
loss."
"Will
he,
indeed?
That
will
be
very
bad."
"How
much
his
business
engrosses
him
already
is
very
plain
from
the
circumstance
of
his
forgetting
to
inquire
for
the
book
you
recommended.
He
was
a
great
deal
too
full
of
the
market
to
think
of
any
thing
else
which
is
just
as
it
should
be,
for
a
thriving
man.
What
has
he
to
do
with
books?
And
I
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
thrive,
and
be
a
very
rich
man
in
time
and
his
being
illiterate
and
coarse
need
not
disturb
us."
"I
wonder
he
did
not
remember
the
book"
was
all
Harriet's
answer,
and
spoken
with
a
degree
of
grave
displeasure
which
Emma
thought
might
be
safely
left
to
itself.
She,
therefore,
said
no
more
for
some
time.
Her
next
beginning
was,
"In
one
respect,
perhaps,
Mr.
Elton's
manners
are
superior
to
Mr.
Knightley's
or
Mr.
Weston's.
They
have
more
gentleness.
They
might
be
more
safely
held
up
as
a
pattern.
There
is
an
openness,
a
quickness,
almost
a
bluntness
in
Mr.
Weston,
which
every
body
likes
in
him,
because
there
is
so
much
good
humour
with
it
but
that
would
not
do
to
be
