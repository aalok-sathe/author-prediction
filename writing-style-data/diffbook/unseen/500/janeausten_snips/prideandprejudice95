plan
and
she
gradually
learned
to
consider
it
herself
with
greater
pleasure
as
well
as
greater
certainty.
Absence
had
increased
her
desire
of
seeing
Charlotte
again,
and
weakened
her
disgust
of
Mr.
Collins.
There
was
novelty
in
the
scheme,
and
as,
with
such
a
mother
and
such
uncompanionable
sisters,
home
could
not
be
faultless,
a
little
change
was
not
unwelcome
for
its
own
sake.
The
journey
would
moreover
give
her
a
peep
at
Jane;
and,
in
short,
as
the
time
drew
near,
she
would
have
been
very
sorry
for
any
delay.
Everything,
however,
went
on
smoothly,
and
was
finally
settled
according
to
Charlotte's
first
sketch.
She
was
to
accompany
Sir
William
and
his
second
daughter.
The
improvement
of
spending
a
night
in
London
was
added
in
time,
and
the
plan
became
perfect
as
plan
could
be.
The
only
pain
was
in
leaving
her
father,
who
would
certainly
miss
her,
and
who,
when
it
came
to
the
point,
so
little
liked
her
going,
that
he
told
her
to
write
to
him,
and
almost
promised
to
answer
her
letter.
The
farewell
between
herself
and
Mr.
Wickham
was
perfectly
friendly;
on
his
side
even
more.
His
present
pursuit
could
not
make
him
forget
that
Elizabeth
had
been
the
first
to
excite
and
to
deserve
his
attention,
the
first
to
listen
and
to
pity,
the
first
to
be
admired;
and
in
his
manner
of
bidding
her
adieu,
wishing
her
every
enjoyment,
reminding
her
of
what
she
was
to
expect
in
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh,
and
trusting
their
opinion
of
her
their
opinion
of
everybody
would
always
coincide,
there
was
a
solicitude,
an
interest
which
she
felt
must
ever
attach
her
to
him
with
a
most
sincere
regard;
and
she
parted
from
him
convinced
that,
whether
married
or
single,
he
must
always
be
her
model
of
the
amiable
and
pleasing.
Her
fellow
travellers
the
next
day
were
not
of
a
kind
to
make
her
think
him
less
agreeable.
Sir
William
Lucas,
and
his
daughter
Maria,
a
good
humoured
girl,
but
as
empty
headed
as
himself,
had
nothing
to
say
that
could
be
worth
hearing,
and
were
listened
to
with
about
as
much
delight
as
the
rattle
of
the
chaise.
Elizabeth
loved
absurdities,
but
she
had
known
Sir
William's
too
long.
He
could
tell
her
nothing
new
of
the
wonders
of
his
presentation
and
knighthood;
and
his
civilities
were
worn
out,
like
his
information.
It
was
a
journey
of
only
twenty
four
miles,
and
they
began
it
so
early
as
to
be
in
Gracechurch
Street
by
noon.
As
they
drove
to
Mr.
Gardiner's
door,
Jane
was
at
a
drawing
room
window
watching
their
arrival;
when
they
entered
the
passage
she
was
there
to
welcome
them,
and
Elizabeth,
looking
earnestly
in
her
face,
was
pleased
to
see
it
healthful
and
lovely
as
ever.
On
the
stairs
were
a
troop
of
little
boys
and
girls,
whose
eagerness
for
their
cousin's
appearance
would
not
allow
them
to
wait
in
the
drawing
room,
and
whose
shyness,
as
they
had
not
