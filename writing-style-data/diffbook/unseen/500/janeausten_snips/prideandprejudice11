agreeable,
he
would
have
talked
to
Mrs.
Long.
But
I
can
guess
how
it
was;
everybody
says
that
he
is
eat
up
with
pride,
and
I
dare
say
he
had
heard
somehow
that
Mrs.
Long
does
not
keep
a
carriage,
and
had
come
to
the
ball
in
a
hack
chaise."
"I
do
not
mind
his
not
talking
to
Mrs.
Long,"
said
Miss
Lucas,
"but
I
wish
he
had
danced
with
Eliza."
"Another
time,
Lizzy,"
said
her
mother,
"I
would
not
dance
with
him,
if
I
were
you."
"I
believe,
ma'am,
I
may
safely
promise
you
never
to
dance
with
him."
"His
pride,"
said
Miss
Lucas,
"does
not
offend
me
so
much
as
pride
often
does,
because
there
is
an
excuse
for
it.
One
cannot
wonder
that
so
very
fine
a
young
man,
with
family,
fortune,
everything
in
his
favour,
should
think
highly
of
himself.
If
I
may
so
express
it,
he
has
a
right
to
be
proud."
"That
is
very
true,"
replied
Elizabeth,
"and
I
could
easily
forgive
his
pride,
if
he
had
not
mortified
mine."
"Pride,"
observed
Mary,
who
piqued
herself
upon
the
solidity
of
her
reflections,
"is
a
very
common
failing,
I
believe.
By
all
that
I
have
ever
read,
I
am
convinced
that
it
is
very
common
indeed;
that
human
nature
is
particularly
prone
to
it,
and
that
there
are
very
few
of
us
who
do
not
cherish
a
feeling
of
self
complacency
on
the
score
of
some
quality
or
other,
real
or
imaginary.
Vanity
and
pride
are
different
things,
though
the
words
are
often
used
synonymously.
A
person
may
be
proud
without
being
vain.
Pride
relates
more
to
our
opinion
of
ourselves,
vanity
to
what
we
would
have
others
think
of
us."
"If
I
were
as
rich
as
Mr.
Darcy,"
cried
a
young
Lucas,
who
came
with
his
sisters,
"I
should
not
care
how
proud
I
was.
I
would
keep
a
pack
of
foxhounds,
and
drink
a
bottle
of
wine
a
day."
"Then
you
would
drink
a
great
deal
more
than
you
ought,"
said
Mrs.
Bennet;
"and
if
I
were
to
see
you
at
it,
I
should
take
away
your
bottle
directly."
The
boy
protested
that
she
should
not;
she
continued
to
declare
that
she
would,
and
the
argument
ended
only
with
the
visit.
The
ladies
of
Longbourn
soon
waited
on
those
of
Netherfield.
The
visit
was
soon
returned
in
due
form.
Miss
Bennet's
pleasing
manners
grew
on
the
goodwill
of
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley;
and
though
the
mother
was
found
to
be
intolerable,
and
the
younger
sisters
not
worth
speaking
to,
a
wish
of
being
better
acquainted
with
them
was
expressed
towards
the
two
eldest.
By
Jane,
this
attention
was
received
with
the
greatest
pleasure,
but
Elizabeth
still
saw
superciliousness
in
their
treatment
of
everybody,
hardly
excepting
even
her
sister,
and
could
not
like
them;
though
their
kindness
to
Jane,
such
as
it
was,
had
a
value
as
arising
in
all
probability
from
the
influence
of
their
brother's
admiration.
It
was
generally
evident
whenever
