not
wait
for
his
reason.
Mr.
Wickham
did
not
play
at
whist,
and
with
ready
delight
was
he
received
at
the
other
table
between
Elizabeth
and
Lydia.
At
first
there
seemed
danger
of
Lydia's
engrossing
him
entirely,
for
she
was
a
most
determined
talker;
but
being
likewise
extremely
fond
of
lottery
tickets,
she
soon
grew
too
much
interested
in
the
game,
too
eager
in
making
bets
and
exclaiming
after
prizes
to
have
attention
for
anyone
in
particular.
Allowing
for
the
common
demands
of
the
game,
Mr.
Wickham
was
therefore
at
leisure
to
talk
to
Elizabeth,
and
she
was
very
willing
to
hear
him,
though
what
she
chiefly
wished
to
hear
she
could
not
hope
to
be
told
the
history
of
his
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Darcy.
She
dared
not
even
mention
that
gentleman.
Her
curiosity,
however,
was
unexpectedly
relieved.
Mr.
Wickham
began
the
subject
himself.
He
inquired
how
far
Netherfield
was
from
Meryton;
and,
after
receiving
her
answer,
asked
in
a
hesitating
manner
how
long
Mr.
Darcy
had
been
staying
there.
"About
a
month,"
said
Elizabeth;
and
then,
unwilling
to
let
the
subject
drop,
added,
"He
is
a
man
of
very
large
property
in
Derbyshire,
I
understand."
"Yes,"
replied
Mr.
Wickham;
"his
estate
there
is
a
noble
one.
A
clear
ten
thousand
per
annum.
You
could
not
have
met
with
a
person
more
capable
of
giving
you
certain
information
on
that
head
than
myself,
for
I
have
been
connected
with
his
family
in
a
particular
manner
from
my
infancy."
Elizabeth
could
not
but
look
surprised.
"You
may
well
be
surprised,
Miss
Bennet,
at
such
an
assertion,
after
seeing,
as
you
probably
might,
the
very
cold
manner
of
our
meeting
yesterday.
Are
you
much
acquainted
with
Mr.
Darcy?"
"As
much
as
I
ever
wish
to
be,"
cried
Elizabeth
very
warmly.
"I
have
spent
four
days
in
the
same
house
with
him,
and
I
think
him
very
disagreeable."
"I
have
no
right
to
give
my
opinion,"
said
Wickham,
"as
to
his
being
agreeable
or
otherwise.
I
am
not
qualified
to
form
one.
I
have
known
him
too
long
and
too
well
to
be
a
fair
judge.
It
is
impossible
for
me
to
be
impartial.
But
I
believe
your
opinion
of
him
would
in
general
astonish
and
perhaps
you
would
not
express
it
quite
so
strongly
anywhere
else.
Here
you
are
in
your
own
family."
"Upon
my
word,
I
say
no
more
here
than
I
might
say
in
any
house
in
the
neighbourhood,
except
Netherfield.
He
is
not
at
all
liked
in
Hertfordshire.
Everybody
is
disgusted
with
his
pride.
You
will
not
find
him
more
favourably
spoken
of
by
anyone."
"I
cannot
pretend
to
be
sorry,"
said
Wickham,
after
a
short
interruption,
"that
he
or
that
any
man
should
not
be
estimated
beyond
their
deserts;
but
with
him
I
believe
it
does
not
often
happen.
The
world
is
blinded
by
his
fortune
and
consequence,
or
frightened
by
his
high
and
imposing
manners,
and
sees
him
only
as
he
chooses
to
be
seen."
"I
should
