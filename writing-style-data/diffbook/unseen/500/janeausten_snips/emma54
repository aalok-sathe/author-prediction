returned
it
"Oh!
here
is
the
charade
you
were
so
obliging
as
to
leave
with
us;
thank
you
for
the
sight
of
it.
We
admired
it
so
much,
that
I
have
ventured
to
write
it
into
Miss
Smith's
collection.
Your
friend
will
not
take
it
amiss
I
hope.
Of
course
I
have
not
transcribed
beyond
the
first
eight
lines."
Mr.
Elton
certainly
did
not
very
well
know
what
to
say.
He
looked
rather
doubtingly
rather
confused;
said
something
about
"honour,"
glanced
at
Emma
and
at
Harriet,
and
then
seeing
the
book
open
on
the
table,
took
it
up,
and
examined
it
very
attentively.
With
the
view
of
passing
off
an
awkward
moment,
Emma
smilingly
said,
"You
must
make
my
apologies
to
your
friend;
but
so
good
a
charade
must
not
be
confined
to
one
or
two.
He
may
be
sure
of
every
woman's
approbation
while
he
writes
with
such
gallantry."
"I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying,"
replied
Mr.
Elton,
though
hesitating
a
good
deal
while
he
spoke;
"I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
at
least
if
my
friend
feels
at
all
as
I
do
I
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
that,
could
he
see
his
little
effusion
honoured
as
I
see
it,
(looking
at
the
book
again,
and
replacing
it
on
the
table),
he
would
consider
it
as
the
proudest
moment
of
his
life."
After
this
speech
he
was
gone
as
soon
as
possible.
Emma
could
not
think
it
too
soon;
for
with
all
his
good
and
agreeable
qualities,
there
was
a
sort
of
parade
in
his
speeches
which
was
very
apt
to
incline
her
to
laugh.
She
ran
away
to
indulge
the
inclination,
leaving
the
tender
and
the
sublime
of
pleasure
to
Harriet's
share.
Though
now
the
middle
of
December,
there
had
yet
been
no
weather
to
prevent
the
young
ladies
from
tolerably
regular
exercise;
and
on
the
morrow,
Emma
had
a
charitable
visit
to
pay
to
a
poor
sick
family,
who
lived
a
little
way
out
of
Highbury.
Their
road
to
this
detached
cottage
was
down
Vicarage
Lane,
a
lane
leading
at
right
angles
from
the
broad,
though
irregular,
main
street
of
the
place;
and,
as
may
be
inferred,
containing
the
blessed
abode
of
Mr.
Elton.
A
few
inferior
dwellings
were
first
to
be
passed,
and
then,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
lane
rose
the
Vicarage,
an
old
and
not
very
good
house,
almost
as
close
to
the
road
as
it
could
be.
It
had
no
advantage
of
situation;
but
had
been
very
much
smartened
up
by
the
present
proprietor;
and,
such
as
it
was,
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
the
two
friends
passing
it
without
a
slackened
pace
and
observing
eyes.
Emma's
remark
was
"There
it
is.
There
go
you
and
your
riddle
book
one
of
these
days."
Harriet's
was
"Oh,
what
a
sweet
house!
How
very
beautiful!
There
are
the
yellow
curtains
that
Miss
Nash
admires
so
much."
"I
do
not
often
walk
this
way
now,"
said
Emma,
as
they
proceeded,
"but
