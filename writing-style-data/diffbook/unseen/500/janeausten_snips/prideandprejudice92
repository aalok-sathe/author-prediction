the
sake
of
what
had
been,
rather
than
what
was.
Charlotte's
first
letters
were
received
with
a
good
deal
of
eagerness;
there
could
not
but
be
curiosity
to
know
how
she
would
speak
of
her
new
home,
how
she
would
like
Lady
Catherine,
and
how
happy
she
would
dare
pronounce
herself
to
be;
though,
when
the
letters
were
read,
Elizabeth
felt
that
Charlotte
expressed
herself
on
every
point
exactly
as
she
might
have
foreseen.
She
wrote
cheerfully,
seemed
surrounded
with
comforts,
and
mentioned
nothing
which
she
could
not
praise.
The
house,
furniture,
neighbourhood,
and
roads,
were
all
to
her
taste,
and
Lady
Catherine's
behaviour
was
most
friendly
and
obliging.
It
was
Mr.
Collins's
picture
of
Hunsford
and
Rosings
rationally
softened;
and
Elizabeth
perceived
that
she
must
wait
for
her
own
visit
there
to
know
the
rest.
Jane
had
already
written
a
few
lines
to
her
sister
to
announce
their
safe
arrival
in
London;
and
when
she
wrote
again,
Elizabeth
hoped
it
would
be
in
her
power
to
say
something
of
the
Bingleys.
Her
impatience
for
this
second
letter
was
as
well
rewarded
as
impatience
generally
is.
Jane
had
been
a
week
in
town
without
either
seeing
or
hearing
from
Caroline.
She
accounted
for
it,
however,
by
supposing
that
her
last
letter
to
her
friend
from
Longbourn
had
by
some
accident
been
lost.
"My
aunt,"
she
continued,
"is
going
to
morrow
into
that
part
of
the
town,
and
I
shall
take
the
opportunity
of
calling
in
Grosvenor
Street."
She
wrote
again
when
the
visit
was
paid,
and
she
had
seen
Miss
Bingley.
"I
did
not
think
Caroline
in
spirits,"
were
her
words,
"but
she
was
very
glad
to
see
me,
and
reproached
me
for
giving
her
no
notice
of
my
coming
to
London.
I
was
right,
therefore,
my
last
letter
had
never
reached
her.
I
inquired
after
their
brother,
of
course.
He
was
well,
but
so
much
engaged
with
Mr.
Darcy
that
they
scarcely
ever
saw
him.
I
found
that
Miss
Darcy
was
expected
to
dinner.
I
wish
I
could
see
her.
My
visit
was
not
long,
as
Caroline
and
Mrs.
Hurst
were
going
out.
I
dare
say
I
shall
see
them
soon
here."
Elizabeth
shook
her
head
over
this
letter.
It
convinced
her
that
accident
only
could
discover
to
Mr.
Bingley
her
sister's
being
in
town.
Four
weeks
passed
away,
and
Jane
saw
nothing
of
him.
She
endeavoured
to
persuade
herself
that
she
did
not
regret
it;
but
she
could
no
longer
be
blind
to
Miss
Bingley's
inattention.
After
waiting
at
home
every
morning
for
a
fortnight,
and
inventing
every
evening
a
fresh
excuse
for
her,
the
visitor
did
at
last
appear;
but
the
shortness
of
her
stay,
and
yet
more,
the
alteration
of
her
manner
would
allow
Jane
to
deceive
herself
no
longer.
The
letter
which
she
wrote
on
this
occasion
to
her
sister
will
prove
what
she
felt.
"My
dearest
Lizzy
will,
I
am
sure,
be
incapable
of
triumphing
in
her
better
judgement,
at
my
expense,
when
I
