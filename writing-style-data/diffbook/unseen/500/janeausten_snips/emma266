how
much
may
be
said
in
her
situation
for
even
that
error!"
"Much,
indeed!"
cried
Emma
feelingly.
"If
a
woman
can
ever
be
excused
for
thinking
only
of
herself,
it
is
in
a
situation
like
Jane
Fairfax's.
Of
such,
one
may
almost
say,
that
'the
world
is
not
their's,
nor
the
world's
law.'"
She
met
Mr.
Weston
on
his
entrance,
with
a
smiling
countenance,
exclaiming,
"A
very
pretty
trick
you
have
been
playing
me,
upon
my
word!
This
was
a
device,
I
suppose,
to
sport
with
my
curiosity,
and
exercise
my
talent
of
guessing.
But
you
really
frightened
me.
I
thought
you
had
lost
half
your
property,
at
least.
And
here,
instead
of
its
being
a
matter
of
condolence,
it
turns
out
to
be
one
of
congratulation.
I
congratulate
you,
Mr.
Weston,
with
all
my
heart,
on
the
prospect
of
having
one
of
the
most
lovely
and
accomplished
young
women
in
England
for
your
daughter."
A
glance
or
two
between
him
and
his
wife,
convinced
him
that
all
was
as
right
as
this
speech
proclaimed;
and
its
happy
effect
on
his
spirits
was
immediate.
His
air
and
voice
recovered
their
usual
briskness:
he
shook
her
heartily
and
gratefully
by
the
hand,
and
entered
on
the
subject
in
a
manner
to
prove,
that
he
now
only
wanted
time
and
persuasion
to
think
the
engagement
no
very
bad
thing.
His
companions
suggested
only
what
could
palliate
imprudence,
or
smooth
objections;
and
by
the
time
they
had
talked
it
all
over
together,
and
he
had
talked
it
all
over
again
with
Emma,
in
their
walk
back
to
Hartfield,
he
was
become
perfectly
reconciled,
and
not
far
from
thinking
it
the
very
best
thing
that
Frank
could
possibly
have
done.
"Harriet,
poor
Harriet!"
Those
were
the
words;
in
them
lay
the
tormenting
ideas
which
Emma
could
not
get
rid
of,
and
which
constituted
the
real
misery
of
the
business
to
her.
Frank
Churchill
had
behaved
very
ill
by
herself
very
ill
in
many
ways,
but
it
was
not
so
much
his
behaviour
as
her
own,
which
made
her
so
angry
with
him.
It
was
the
scrape
which
he
had
drawn
her
into
on
Harriet's
account,
that
gave
the
deepest
hue
to
his
offence.
Poor
Harriet!
to
be
a
second
time
the
dupe
of
her
misconceptions
and
flattery.
Mr.
Knightley
had
spoken
prophetically,
when
he
once
said,
"Emma,
you
have
been
no
friend
to
Harriet
Smith."
She
was
afraid
she
had
done
her
nothing
but
disservice.
It
was
true
that
she
had
not
to
charge
herself,
in
this
instance
as
in
the
former,
with
being
the
sole
and
original
author
of
the
mischief;
with
having
suggested
such
feelings
as
might
otherwise
never
have
entered
Harriet's
imagination;
for
Harriet
had
acknowledged
her
admiration
and
preference
of
Frank
Churchill
before
she
had
ever
given
her
a
hint
on
the
subject;
but
she
felt
completely
guilty
of
having
encouraged
what
she
might
have
repressed.
She
might
have
prevented
the
indulgence
and
increase
of
such
sentiments.
Her
influence
would
