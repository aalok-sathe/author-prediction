severe
one
it
was.
She
had
to
destroy
all
the
hopes
which
she
had
been
so
industriously
feeding
to
appear
in
the
ungracious
character
of
the
one
preferred
and
acknowledge
herself
grossly
mistaken
and
mis
judging
in
all
her
ideas
on
one
subject,
all
her
observations,
all
her
convictions,
all
her
prophecies
for
the
last
six
weeks.
The
confession
completely
renewed
her
first
shame
and
the
sight
of
Harriet's
tears
made
her
think
that
she
should
never
be
in
charity
with
herself
again.
Harriet
bore
the
intelligence
very
well
blaming
nobody
and
in
every
thing
testifying
such
an
ingenuousness
of
disposition
and
lowly
opinion
of
herself,
as
must
appear
with
particular
advantage
at
that
moment
to
her
friend.
Emma
was
in
the
humour
to
value
simplicity
and
modesty
to
the
utmost;
and
all
that
was
amiable,
all
that
ought
to
be
attaching,
seemed
on
Harriet's
side,
not
her
own.
Harriet
did
not
consider
herself
as
having
any
thing
to
complain
of.
The
affection
of
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Elton
would
have
been
too
great
a
distinction.
She
never
could
have
deserved
him
and
nobody
but
so
partial
and
kind
a
friend
as
Miss
Woodhouse
would
have
thought
it
possible.
Her
tears
fell
abundantly
but
her
grief
was
so
truly
artless,
that
no
dignity
could
have
made
it
more
respectable
in
Emma's
eyes
and
she
listened
to
her
and
tried
to
console
her
with
all
her
heart
and
understanding
really
for
the
time
convinced
that
Harriet
was
the
superior
creature
of
the
two
and
that
to
resemble
her
would
be
more
for
her
own
welfare
and
happiness
than
all
that
genius
or
intelligence
could
do.
It
was
rather
too
late
in
the
day
to
set
about
being
simple
minded
and
ignorant;
but
she
left
her
with
every
previous
resolution
confirmed
of
being
humble
and
discreet,
and
repressing
imagination
all
the
rest
of
her
life.
Her
second
duty
now,
inferior
only
to
her
father's
claims,
was
to
promote
Harriet's
comfort,
and
endeavour
to
prove
her
own
affection
in
some
better
method
than
by
match
making.
She
got
her
to
Hartfield,
and
shewed
her
the
most
unvarying
kindness,
striving
to
occupy
and
amuse
her,
and
by
books
and
conversation,
to
drive
Mr.
Elton
from
her
thoughts.
Time,
she
knew,
must
be
allowed
for
this
being
thoroughly
done;
and
she
could
suppose
herself
but
an
indifferent
judge
of
such
matters
in
general,
and
very
inadequate
to
sympathise
in
an
attachment
to
Mr.
Elton
in
particular;
but
it
seemed
to
her
reasonable
that
at
Harriet's
age,
and
with
the
entire
extinction
of
all
hope,
such
a
progress
might
be
made
towards
a
state
of
composure
by
the
time
of
Mr.
Elton's
return,
as
to
allow
them
all
to
meet
again
in
the
common
routine
of
acquaintance,
without
any
danger
of
betraying
sentiments
or
increasing
them.
Harriet
did
think
him
all
perfection,
and
maintained
the
non
existence
of
any
body
equal
to
him
in
person
or
goodness
and
did,
in
truth,
prove
herself
more
resolutely
