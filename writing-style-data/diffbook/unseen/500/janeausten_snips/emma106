and
farther,
had
been
indebted
to
him
for
such
attentions,
during
a
severe
camp
fever,
as
he
believed
had
saved
his
life.
These
were
claims
which
he
did
not
learn
to
overlook,
though
some
years
passed
away
from
the
death
of
poor
Fairfax,
before
his
own
return
to
England
put
any
thing
in
his
power.
When
he
did
return,
he
sought
out
the
child
and
took
notice
of
her.
He
was
a
married
man,
with
only
one
living
child,
a
girl,
about
Jane's
age:
and
Jane
became
their
guest,
paying
them
long
visits
and
growing
a
favourite
with
all;
and
before
she
was
nine
years
old,
his
daughter's
great
fondness
for
her,
and
his
own
wish
of
being
a
real
friend,
united
to
produce
an
offer
from
Colonel
Campbell
of
undertaking
the
whole
charge
of
her
education.
It
was
accepted;
and
from
that
period
Jane
had
belonged
to
Colonel
Campbell's
family,
and
had
lived
with
them
entirely,
only
visiting
her
grandmother
from
time
to
time.
The
plan
was
that
she
should
be
brought
up
for
educating
others;
the
very
few
hundred
pounds
which
she
inherited
from
her
father
making
independence
impossible.
To
provide
for
her
otherwise
was
out
of
Colonel
Campbell's
power;
for
though
his
income,
by
pay
and
appointments,
was
handsome,
his
fortune
was
moderate
and
must
be
all
his
daughter's;
but,
by
giving
her
an
education,
he
hoped
to
be
supplying
the
means
of
respectable
subsistence
hereafter.
Such
was
Jane
Fairfax's
history.
She
had
fallen
into
good
hands,
known
nothing
but
kindness
from
the
Campbells,
and
been
given
an
excellent
education.
Living
constantly
with
right
minded
and
well
informed
people,
her
heart
and
understanding
had
received
every
advantage
of
discipline
and
culture;
and
Colonel
Campbell's
residence
being
in
London,
every
lighter
talent
had
been
done
full
justice
to,
by
the
attendance
of
first
rate
masters.
Her
disposition
and
abilities
were
equally
worthy
of
all
that
friendship
could
do;
and
at
eighteen
or
nineteen
she
was,
as
far
as
such
an
early
age
can
be
qualified
for
the
care
of
children,
fully
competent
to
the
office
of
instruction
herself;
but
she
was
too
much
beloved
to
be
parted
with.
Neither
father
nor
mother
could
promote,
and
the
daughter
could
not
endure
it.
The
evil
day
was
put
off.
It
was
easy
to
decide
that
she
was
still
too
young;
and
Jane
remained
with
them,
sharing,
as
another
daughter,
in
all
the
rational
pleasures
of
an
elegant
society,
and
a
judicious
mixture
of
home
and
amusement,
with
only
the
drawback
of
the
future,
the
sobering
suggestions
of
her
own
good
understanding
to
remind
her
that
all
this
might
soon
be
over.
The
affection
of
the
whole
family,
the
warm
attachment
of
Miss
Campbell
in
particular,
was
the
more
honourable
to
each
party
from
the
circumstance
of
Jane's
decided
superiority
both
in
beauty
and
acquirements.
That
nature
had
given
it
in
feature
could
not
be
unseen
by
the
young
woman,
nor
could
her
higher
powers
of
mind
be
unfelt
by
the
