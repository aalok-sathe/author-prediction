pretty
and
good
natured,
let
me
tell
you,
that
in
the
degree
she
possesses
them,
they
are
not
trivial
recommendations
to
the
world
in
general,
for
she
is,
in
fact,
a
beautiful
girl,
and
must
be
thought
so
by
ninety
nine
people
out
of
an
hundred;
and
till
it
appears
that
men
are
much
more
philosophic
on
the
subject
of
beauty
than
they
are
generally
supposed;
till
they
do
fall
in
love
with
well
informed
minds
instead
of
handsome
faces,
a
girl,
with
such
loveliness
as
Harriet,
has
a
certainty
of
being
admired
and
sought
after,
of
having
the
power
of
chusing
from
among
many,
consequently
a
claim
to
be
nice.
Her
good
nature,
too,
is
not
so
very
slight
a
claim,
comprehending,
as
it
does,
real,
thorough
sweetness
of
temper
and
manner,
a
very
humble
opinion
of
herself,
and
a
great
readiness
to
be
pleased
with
other
people.
I
am
very
much
mistaken
if
your
sex
in
general
would
not
think
such
beauty,
and
such
temper,
the
highest
claims
a
woman
could
possess."
"Upon
my
word,
Emma,
to
hear
you
abusing
the
reason
you
have,
is
almost
enough
to
make
me
think
so
too.
Better
be
without
sense,
than
misapply
it
as
you
do."
"To
be
sure!"
cried
she
playfully.
"I
know
that
is
the
feeling
of
you
all.
I
know
that
such
a
girl
as
Harriet
is
exactly
what
every
man
delights
in
what
at
once
bewitches
his
senses
and
satisfies
his
judgment.
Oh!
Harriet
may
pick
and
chuse.
Were
you,
yourself,
ever
to
marry,
she
is
the
very
woman
for
you.
And
is
she,
at
seventeen,
just
entering
into
life,
just
beginning
to
be
known,
to
be
wondered
at
because
she
does
not
accept
the
first
offer
she
receives?
No
pray
let
her
have
time
to
look
about
her."
"I
have
always
thought
it
a
very
foolish
intimacy,"
said
Mr.
Knightley
presently,
"though
I
have
kept
my
thoughts
to
myself;
but
I
now
perceive
that
it
will
be
a
very
unfortunate
one
for
Harriet.
You
will
puff
her
up
with
such
ideas
of
her
own
beauty,
and
of
what
she
has
a
claim
to,
that,
in
a
little
while,
nobody
within
her
reach
will
be
good
enough
for
her.
Vanity
working
on
a
weak
head,
produces
every
sort
of
mischief.
Nothing
so
easy
as
for
a
young
lady
to
raise
her
expectations
too
high.
Miss
Harriet
Smith
may
not
find
offers
of
marriage
flow
in
so
fast,
though
she
is
a
very
pretty
girl.
Men
of
sense,
whatever
you
may
chuse
to
say,
do
not
want
silly
wives.
Men
of
family
would
not
be
very
fond
of
connecting
themselves
with
a
girl
of
such
obscurity
and
most
prudent
men
would
be
afraid
of
the
inconvenience
and
disgrace
they
might
be
involved
in,
when
the
mystery
of
her
parentage
came
to
be
revealed.
Let
her
marry
Robert
Martin,
and
she
is
safe,
respectable,
and
happy
for
ever;
but
if
you
encourage
her
to
expect
to
marry
greatly,
and
