seen
her
for
a
twelvemonth,
prevented
their
coming
lower.
All
was
joy
and
kindness.
The
day
passed
most
pleasantly
away;
the
morning
in
bustle
and
shopping,
and
the
evening
at
one
of
the
theatres.
Elizabeth
then
contrived
to
sit
by
her
aunt.
Their
first
object
was
her
sister;
and
she
was
more
grieved
than
astonished
to
hear,
in
reply
to
her
minute
inquiries,
that
though
Jane
always
struggled
to
support
her
spirits,
there
were
periods
of
dejection.
It
was
reasonable,
however,
to
hope
that
they
would
not
continue
long.
Mrs.
Gardiner
gave
her
the
particulars
also
of
Miss
Bingley's
visit
in
Gracechurch
Street,
and
repeated
conversations
occurring
at
different
times
between
Jane
and
herself,
which
proved
that
the
former
had,
from
her
heart,
given
up
the
acquaintance.
Mrs.
Gardiner
then
rallied
her
niece
on
Wickham's
desertion,
and
complimented
her
on
bearing
it
so
well.
"But
my
dear
Elizabeth,"
she
added,
"what
sort
of
girl
is
Miss
King?
I
should
be
sorry
to
think
our
friend
mercenary."
"Pray,
my
dear
aunt,
what
is
the
difference
in
matrimonial
affairs,
between
the
mercenary
and
the
prudent
motive?
Where
does
discretion
end,
and
avarice
begin?
Last
Christmas
you
were
afraid
of
his
marrying
me,
because
it
would
be
imprudent;
and
now,
because
he
is
trying
to
get
a
girl
with
only
ten
thousand
pounds,
you
want
to
find
out
that
he
is
mercenary."
"If
you
will
only
tell
me
what
sort
of
girl
Miss
King
is,
I
shall
know
what
to
think."
"She
is
a
very
good
kind
of
girl,
I
believe.
I
know
no
harm
of
her."
"But
he
paid
her
not
the
smallest
attention
till
her
grandfather's
death
made
her
mistress
of
this
fortune."
"No
why
should
he?
If
it
were
not
allowable
for
him
to
gain
my
affections
because
I
had
no
money,
what
occasion
could
there
be
for
making
love
to
a
girl
whom
he
did
not
care
about,
and
who
was
equally
poor?"
"But
there
seems
an
indelicacy
in
directing
his
attentions
towards
her
so
soon
after
this
event."
"A
man
in
distressed
circumstances
has
not
time
for
all
those
elegant
decorums
which
other
people
may
observe.
If
she
does
not
object
to
it,
why
should
we?"
"Her
not
objecting
does
not
justify
him.
It
only
shows
her
being
deficient
in
something
herself
sense
or
feeling."
"Well,"
cried
Elizabeth,
"have
it
as
you
choose.
He
shall
be
mercenary,
and
she
shall
be
foolish."
"No,
Lizzy,
that
is
what
I
do
not
choose.
I
should
be
sorry,
you
know,
to
think
ill
of
a
young
man
who
has
lived
so
long
in
Derbyshire."
"Oh!
if
that
is
all,
I
have
a
very
poor
opinion
of
young
men
who
live
in
Derbyshire;
and
their
intimate
friends
who
live
in
Hertfordshire
are
not
much
better.
I
am
sick
of
them
all.
Thank
Heaven!
I
am
going
to
morrow
where
I
shall
find
a
man
who
has
not
one
agreeable
quality,
who
has
neither
manner
nor
sense
to
recommend
him.
Stupid
men
are
