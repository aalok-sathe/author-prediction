of
Miss
Fairfax
could
endure
such
society
and
friendship
as
the
Vicarage
had
to
offer.
"She
is
a
riddle,
quite
a
riddle!"
said
she.
"To
chuse
to
remain
here
month
after
month,
under
privations
of
every
sort!
And
now
to
chuse
the
mortification
of
Mrs.
Elton's
notice
and
the
penury
of
her
conversation,
rather
than
return
to
the
superior
companions
who
have
always
loved
her
with
such
real,
generous
affection."
Jane
had
come
to
Highbury
professedly
for
three
months;
the
Campbells
were
gone
to
Ireland
for
three
months;
but
now
the
Campbells
had
promised
their
daughter
to
stay
at
least
till
Midsummer,
and
fresh
invitations
had
arrived
for
her
to
join
them
there.
According
to
Miss
Bates
it
all
came
from
her
Mrs.
Dixon
had
written
most
pressingly.
Would
Jane
but
go,
means
were
to
be
found,
servants
sent,
friends
contrived
no
travelling
difficulty
allowed
to
exist;
but
still
she
had
declined
it!
"She
must
have
some
motive,
more
powerful
than
appears,
for
refusing
this
invitation,"
was
Emma's
conclusion.
"She
must
be
under
some
sort
of
penance,
inflicted
either
by
the
Campbells
or
herself.
There
is
great
fear,
great
caution,
great
resolution
somewhere.
She
is
not
to
be
with
the
Dixons.
The
decree
is
issued
by
somebody.
But
why
must
she
consent
to
be
with
the
Eltons?
Here
is
quite
a
separate
puzzle."
Upon
her
speaking
her
wonder
aloud
on
that
part
of
the
subject,
before
the
few
who
knew
her
opinion
of
Mrs.
Elton,
Mrs.
Weston
ventured
this
apology
for
Jane.
"We
cannot
suppose
that
she
has
any
great
enjoyment
at
the
Vicarage,
my
dear
Emma
but
it
is
better
than
being
always
at
home.
Her
aunt
is
a
good
creature,
but,
as
a
constant
companion,
must
be
very
tiresome.
We
must
consider
what
Miss
Fairfax
quits,
before
we
condemn
her
taste
for
what
she
goes
to."
"You
are
right,
Mrs.
Weston,"
said
Mr.
Knightley
warmly,
"Miss
Fairfax
is
as
capable
as
any
of
us
of
forming
a
just
opinion
of
Mrs.
Elton.
Could
she
have
chosen
with
whom
to
associate,
she
would
not
have
chosen
her.
But
(with
a
reproachful
smile
at
Emma)
she
receives
attentions
from
Mrs.
Elton,
which
nobody
else
pays
her."
Emma
felt
that
Mrs.
Weston
was
giving
her
a
momentary
glance;
and
she
was
herself
struck
by
his
warmth.
With
a
faint
blush,
she
presently
replied,
"Such
attentions
as
Mrs.
Elton's,
I
should
have
imagined,
would
rather
disgust
than
gratify
Miss
Fairfax.
Mrs.
Elton's
invitations
I
should
have
imagined
any
thing
but
inviting."
"I
should
not
wonder,"
said
Mrs.
Weston,
"if
Miss
Fairfax
were
to
have
been
drawn
on
beyond
her
own
inclination,
by
her
aunt's
eagerness
in
accepting
Mrs.
Elton's
civilities
for
her.
Poor
Miss
Bates
may
very
likely
have
committed
her
niece
and
hurried
her
into
a
greater
appearance
of
intimacy
than
her
own
good
sense
would
have
dictated,
in
spite
of
the
very
natural
wish
of
a
little
change."
Both
felt
rather
anxious
to
hear
him
speak
again;
and
after
a
