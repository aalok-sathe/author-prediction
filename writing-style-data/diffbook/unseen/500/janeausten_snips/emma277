to
defer
this
ceremonious
call
till
a
little
time
had
passed,
and
Mr.
Churchill
could
be
reconciled
to
the
engagement's
becoming
known;
as,
considering
every
thing,
she
thought
such
a
visit
could
not
be
paid
without
leading
to
reports:
but
Mr.
Weston
had
thought
differently;
he
was
extremely
anxious
to
shew
his
approbation
to
Miss
Fairfax
and
her
family,
and
did
not
conceive
that
any
suspicion
could
be
excited
by
it;
or
if
it
were,
that
it
would
be
of
any
consequence;
for
"such
things,"
he
observed,
"always
got
about."
Emma
smiled,
and
felt
that
Mr.
Weston
had
very
good
reason
for
saying
so.
They
had
gone,
in
short
and
very
great
had
been
the
evident
distress
and
confusion
of
the
lady.
She
had
hardly
been
able
to
speak
a
word,
and
every
look
and
action
had
shewn
how
deeply
she
was
suffering
from
consciousness.
The
quiet,
heart
felt
satisfaction
of
the
old
lady,
and
the
rapturous
delight
of
her
daughter
who
proved
even
too
joyous
to
talk
as
usual,
had
been
a
gratifying,
yet
almost
an
affecting,
scene.
They
were
both
so
truly
respectable
in
their
happiness,
so
disinterested
in
every
sensation;
thought
so
much
of
Jane;
so
much
of
every
body,
and
so
little
of
themselves,
that
every
kindly
feeling
was
at
work
for
them.
Miss
Fairfax's
recent
illness
had
offered
a
fair
plea
for
Mrs.
Weston
to
invite
her
to
an
airing;
she
had
drawn
back
and
declined
at
first,
but,
on
being
pressed
had
yielded;
and,
in
the
course
of
their
drive,
Mrs.
Weston
had,
by
gentle
encouragement,
overcome
so
much
of
her
embarrassment,
as
to
bring
her
to
converse
on
the
important
subject.
Apologies
for
her
seemingly
ungracious
silence
in
their
first
reception,
and
the
warmest
expressions
of
the
gratitude
she
was
always
feeling
towards
herself
and
Mr.
Weston,
must
necessarily
open
the
cause;
but
when
these
effusions
were
put
by,
they
had
talked
a
good
deal
of
the
present
and
of
the
future
state
of
the
engagement.
Mrs.
Weston
was
convinced
that
such
conversation
must
be
the
greatest
relief
to
her
companion,
pent
up
within
her
own
mind
as
every
thing
had
so
long
been,
and
was
very
much
pleased
with
all
that
she
had
said
on
the
subject.
"On
the
misery
of
what
she
had
suffered,
during
the
concealment
of
so
many
months,"
continued
Mrs.
Weston,
"she
was
energetic.
This
was
one
of
her
expressions.
'I
will
not
say,
that
since
I
entered
into
the
engagement
I
have
not
had
some
happy
moments;
but
I
can
say,
that
I
have
never
known
the
blessing
of
one
tranquil
hour:'
and
the
quivering
lip,
Emma,
which
uttered
it,
was
an
attestation
that
I
felt
at
my
heart."
"Poor
girl!"
said
Emma.
"She
thinks
herself
wrong,
then,
for
having
consented
to
a
private
engagement?"
"Wrong!
No
one,
I
believe,
can
blame
her
more
than
she
is
disposed
to
blame
herself.
'The
consequence,'
said
she,
'has
been
a
state
of
perpetual
suffering
to
me;
and
so
it
