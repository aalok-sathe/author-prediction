living
in
it
either
too
much
or
too
little.
I
perfectly
understand
your
situation,
however,
Miss
Woodhouse
(looking
towards
Mr.
Woodhouse),
Your
father's
state
of
health
must
be
a
great
drawback.
Why
does
not
he
try
Bath?
Indeed
he
should.
Let
me
recommend
Bath
to
you.
I
assure
you
I
have
no
doubt
of
its
doing
Mr.
Woodhouse
good."
"My
father
tried
it
more
than
once,
formerly;
but
without
receiving
any
benefit;
and
Mr.
Perry,
whose
name,
I
dare
say,
is
not
unknown
to
you,
does
not
conceive
it
would
be
at
all
more
likely
to
be
useful
now."
"Ah!
that's
a
great
pity;
for
I
assure
you,
Miss
Woodhouse,
where
the
waters
do
agree,
it
is
quite
wonderful
the
relief
they
give.
In
my
Bath
life,
I
have
seen
such
instances
of
it!
And
it
is
so
cheerful
a
place,
that
it
could
not
fail
of
being
of
use
to
Mr.
Woodhouse's
spirits,
which,
I
understand,
are
sometimes
much
depressed.
And
as
to
its
recommendations
to
you,
I
fancy
I
need
not
take
much
pains
to
dwell
on
them.
The
advantages
of
Bath
to
the
young
are
pretty
generally
understood.
It
would
be
a
charming
introduction
for
you,
who
have
lived
so
secluded
a
life;
and
I
could
immediately
secure
you
some
of
the
best
society
in
the
place.
A
line
from
me
would
bring
you
a
little
host
of
acquaintance;
and
my
particular
friend,
Mrs.
Partridge,
the
lady
I
have
always
resided
with
when
in
Bath,
would
be
most
happy
to
shew
you
any
attentions,
and
would
be
the
very
person
for
you
to
go
into
public
with."
It
was
as
much
as
Emma
could
bear,
without
being
impolite.
The
idea
of
her
being
indebted
to
Mrs.
Elton
for
what
was
called
an
introduction
of
her
going
into
public
under
the
auspices
of
a
friend
of
Mrs.
Elton's
probably
some
vulgar,
dashing
widow,
who,
with
the
help
of
a
boarder,
just
made
a
shift
to
live!
The
dignity
of
Miss
Woodhouse,
of
Hartfield,
was
sunk
indeed!
She
restrained
herself,
however,
from
any
of
the
reproofs
she
could
have
given,
and
only
thanked
Mrs.
Elton
coolly;
"but
their
going
to
Bath
was
quite
out
of
the
question;
and
she
was
not
perfectly
convinced
that
the
place
might
suit
her
better
than
her
father."
And
then,
to
prevent
farther
outrage
and
indignation,
changed
the
subject
directly.
"I
do
not
ask
whether
you
are
musical,
Mrs.
Elton.
Upon
these
occasions,
a
lady's
character
generally
precedes
her;
and
Highbury
has
long
known
that
you
are
a
superior
performer."
"Oh!
no,
indeed;
I
must
protest
against
any
such
idea.
A
superior
performer!
very
far
from
it,
I
assure
you.
Consider
from
how
partial
a
quarter
your
information
came.
I
am
doatingly
fond
of
music
passionately
fond;
and
my
friends
say
I
am
not
entirely
devoid
of
taste;
but
as
to
any
thing
else,
upon
my
honour
my
performance
is
mediocre
to
the
last
degree.
You,
Miss
Woodhouse,
I
well
know,
play
delightfully.
I
