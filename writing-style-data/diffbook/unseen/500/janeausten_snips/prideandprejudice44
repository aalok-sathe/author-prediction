struck
with
the
stranger's
air,
all
wondered
who
he
could
be;
and
Kitty
and
Lydia,
determined
if
possible
to
find
out,
led
the
way
across
the
street,
under
pretense
of
wanting
something
in
an
opposite
shop,
and
fortunately
had
just
gained
the
pavement
when
the
two
gentlemen,
turning
back,
had
reached
the
same
spot.
Mr.
Denny
addressed
them
directly,
and
entreated
permission
to
introduce
his
friend,
Mr.
Wickham,
who
had
returned
with
him
the
day
before
from
town,
and
he
was
happy
to
say
had
accepted
a
commission
in
their
corps.
This
was
exactly
as
it
should
be;
for
the
young
man
wanted
only
regimentals
to
make
him
completely
charming.
His
appearance
was
greatly
in
his
favour;
he
had
all
the
best
part
of
beauty,
a
fine
countenance,
a
good
figure,
and
very
pleasing
address.
The
introduction
was
followed
up
on
his
side
by
a
happy
readiness
of
conversation
a
readiness
at
the
same
time
perfectly
correct
and
unassuming;
and
the
whole
party
were
still
standing
and
talking
together
very
agreeably,
when
the
sound
of
horses
drew
their
notice,
and
Darcy
and
Bingley
were
seen
riding
down
the
street.
On
distinguishing
the
ladies
of
the
group,
the
two
gentlemen
came
directly
towards
them,
and
began
the
usual
civilities.
Bingley
was
the
principal
spokesman,
and
Miss
Bennet
the
principal
object.
He
was
then,
he
said,
on
his
way
to
Longbourn
on
purpose
to
inquire
after
her.
Mr.
Darcy
corroborated
it
with
a
bow,
and
was
beginning
to
determine
not
to
fix
his
eyes
on
Elizabeth,
when
they
were
suddenly
arrested
by
the
sight
of
the
stranger,
and
Elizabeth
happening
to
see
the
countenance
of
both
as
they
looked
at
each
other,
was
all
astonishment
at
the
effect
of
the
meeting.
Both
changed
colour,
one
looked
white,
the
other
red.
Mr.
Wickham,
after
a
few
moments,
touched
his
hat
a
salutation
which
Mr.
Darcy
just
deigned
to
return.
What
could
be
the
meaning
of
it?
It
was
impossible
to
imagine;
it
was
impossible
not
to
long
to
know.
In
another
minute,
Mr.
Bingley,
but
without
seeming
to
have
noticed
what
passed,
took
leave
and
rode
on
with
his
friend.
Mr.
Denny
and
Mr.
Wickham
walked
with
the
young
ladies
to
the
door
of
Mr.
Phillip's
house,
and
then
made
their
bows,
in
spite
of
Miss
Lydia's
pressing
entreaties
that
they
should
come
in,
and
even
in
spite
of
Mrs.
Phillips's
throwing
up
the
parlour
window
and
loudly
seconding
the
invitation.
Mrs.
Phillips
was
always
glad
to
see
her
nieces;
and
the
two
eldest,
from
their
recent
absence,
were
particularly
welcome,
and
she
was
eagerly
expressing
her
surprise
at
their
sudden
return
home,
which,
as
their
own
carriage
had
not
fetched
them,
she
should
have
known
nothing
about,
if
she
had
not
happened
to
see
Mr.
Jones's
shop
boy
in
the
street,
who
had
told
her
that
they
were
not
to
send
any
more
draughts
to
Netherfield
because
the
Miss
Bennets
were
come
away,
when
her
civility
was
claimed
towards
Mr.
Collins
by
