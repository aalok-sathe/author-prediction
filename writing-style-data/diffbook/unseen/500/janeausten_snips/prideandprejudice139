so
all
the
way,
if
Kitty
had
not
been
sick;
and
when
we
got
to
the
George,
I
do
think
we
behaved
very
handsomely,
for
we
treated
the
other
three
with
the
nicest
cold
luncheon
in
the
world,
and
if
you
would
have
gone,
we
would
have
treated
you
too.
And
then
when
we
came
away
it
was
such
fun!
I
thought
we
never
should
have
got
into
the
coach.
I
was
ready
to
die
of
laughter.
And
then
we
were
so
merry
all
the
way
home!
we
talked
and
laughed
so
loud,
that
anybody
might
have
heard
us
ten
miles
off!"
To
this
Mary
very
gravely
replied,
"Far
be
it
from
me,
my
dear
sister,
to
depreciate
such
pleasures!
They
would
doubtless
be
congenial
with
the
generality
of
female
minds.
But
I
confess
they
would
have
no
charms
for
me
I
should
infinitely
prefer
a
book."
But
of
this
answer
Lydia
heard
not
a
word.
She
seldom
listened
to
anybody
for
more
than
half
a
minute,
and
never
attended
to
Mary
at
all.
In
the
afternoon
Lydia
was
urgent
with
the
rest
of
the
girls
to
walk
to
Meryton,
and
to
see
how
everybody
went
on;
but
Elizabeth
steadily
opposed
the
scheme.
It
should
not
be
said
that
the
Miss
Bennets
could
not
be
at
home
half
a
day
before
they
were
in
pursuit
of
the
officers.
There
was
another
reason
too
for
her
opposition.
She
dreaded
seeing
Mr.
Wickham
again,
and
was
resolved
to
avoid
it
as
long
as
possible.
The
comfort
to
her
of
the
regiment's
approaching
removal
was
indeed
beyond
expression.
In
a
fortnight
they
were
to
go
and
once
gone,
she
hoped
there
could
be
nothing
more
to
plague
her
on
his
account.
She
had
not
been
many
hours
at
home
before
she
found
that
the
Brighton
scheme,
of
which
Lydia
had
given
them
a
hint
at
the
inn,
was
under
frequent
discussion
between
her
parents.
Elizabeth
saw
directly
that
her
father
had
not
the
smallest
intention
of
yielding;
but
his
answers
were
at
the
same
time
so
vague
and
equivocal,
that
her
mother,
though
often
disheartened,
had
never
yet
despaired
of
succeeding
at
last.
Elizabeth's
impatience
to
acquaint
Jane
with
what
had
happened
could
no
longer
be
overcome;
and
at
length,
resolving
to
suppress
every
particular
in
which
her
sister
was
concerned,
and
preparing
her
to
be
surprised,
she
related
to
her
the
next
morning
the
chief
of
the
scene
between
Mr.
Darcy
and
herself.
Miss
Bennet's
astonishment
was
soon
lessened
by
the
strong
sisterly
partiality
which
made
any
admiration
of
Elizabeth
appear
perfectly
natural;
and
all
surprise
was
shortly
lost
in
other
feelings.
She
was
sorry
that
Mr.
Darcy
should
have
delivered
his
sentiments
in
a
manner
so
little
suited
to
recommend
them;
but
still
more
was
she
grieved
for
the
unhappiness
which
her
sister's
refusal
must
have
given
him.
"His
being
so
sure
of
succeeding
was
wrong,"
said
she,
"and
certainly
ought
not
to
have
appeared;
but
consider
how
much
it
must
