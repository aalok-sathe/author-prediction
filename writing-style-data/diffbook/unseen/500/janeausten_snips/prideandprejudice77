Lodge
to
throw
himself
at
her
feet.
He
was
anxious
to
avoid
the
notice
of
his
cousins,
from
a
conviction
that
if
they
saw
him
depart,
they
could
not
fail
to
conjecture
his
design,
and
he
was
not
willing
to
have
the
attempt
known
till
its
success
might
be
known
likewise;
for
though
feeling
almost
secure,
and
with
reason,
for
Charlotte
had
been
tolerably
encouraging,
he
was
comparatively
diffident
since
the
adventure
of
Wednesday.
His
reception,
however,
was
of
the
most
flattering
kind.
Miss
Lucas
perceived
him
from
an
upper
window
as
he
walked
towards
the
house,
and
instantly
set
out
to
meet
him
accidentally
in
the
lane.
But
little
had
she
dared
to
hope
that
so
much
love
and
eloquence
awaited
her
there.
In
as
short
a
time
as
Mr.
Collins's
long
speeches
would
allow,
everything
was
settled
between
them
to
the
satisfaction
of
both;
and
as
they
entered
the
house
he
earnestly
entreated
her
to
name
the
day
that
was
to
make
him
the
happiest
of
men;
and
though
such
a
solicitation
must
be
waived
for
the
present,
the
lady
felt
no
inclination
to
trifle
with
his
happiness.
The
stupidity
with
which
he
was
favoured
by
nature
must
guard
his
courtship
from
any
charm
that
could
make
a
woman
wish
for
its
continuance;
and
Miss
Lucas,
who
accepted
him
solely
from
the
pure
and
disinterested
desire
of
an
establishment,
cared
not
how
soon
that
establishment
were
gained.
Sir
William
and
Lady
Lucas
were
speedily
applied
to
for
their
consent;
and
it
was
bestowed
with
a
most
joyful
alacrity.
Mr.
Collins's
present
circumstances
made
it
a
most
eligible
match
for
their
daughter,
to
whom
they
could
give
little
fortune;
and
his
prospects
of
future
wealth
were
exceedingly
fair.
Lady
Lucas
began
directly
to
calculate,
with
more
interest
than
the
matter
had
ever
excited
before,
how
many
years
longer
Mr.
Bennet
was
likely
to
live;
and
Sir
William
gave
it
as
his
decided
opinion,
that
whenever
Mr.
Collins
should
be
in
possession
of
the
Longbourn
estate,
it
would
be
highly
expedient
that
both
he
and
his
wife
should
make
their
appearance
at
St.
James's.
The
whole
family,
in
short,
were
properly
overjoyed
on
the
occasion.
The
younger
girls
formed
hopes
of
coming
out
a
year
or
two
sooner
than
they
might
otherwise
have
done;
and
the
boys
were
relieved
from
their
apprehension
of
Charlotte's
dying
an
old
maid.
Charlotte
herself
was
tolerably
composed.
She
had
gained
her
point,
and
had
time
to
consider
of
it.
Her
reflections
were
in
general
satisfactory.
Mr.
Collins,
to
be
sure,
was
neither
sensible
nor
agreeable;
his
society
was
irksome,
and
his
attachment
to
her
must
be
imaginary.
But
still
he
would
be
her
husband.
Without
thinking
highly
either
of
men
or
matrimony,
marriage
had
always
been
her
object;
it
was
the
only
provision
for
well
educated
young
women
of
small
fortune,
and
however
uncertain
of
giving
happiness,
must
be
their
pleasantest
preservative
from
want.
This
preservative
she
had
now
obtained;
and
at
the
age
