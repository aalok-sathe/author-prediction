very
civil,
but
attended
with
all
the
embarrassment
which,
though
proceeding
from
shyness
and
the
fear
of
doing
wrong,
would
easily
give
to
those
who
felt
themselves
inferior
the
belief
of
her
being
proud
and
reserved.
Mrs.
Gardiner
and
her
niece,
however,
did
her
justice,
and
pitied
her.
By
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
they
were
noticed
only
by
a
curtsey;
and,
on
their
being
seated,
a
pause,
awkward
as
such
pauses
must
always
be,
succeeded
for
a
few
moments.
It
was
first
broken
by
Mrs.
Annesley,
a
genteel,
agreeable
looking
woman,
whose
endeavour
to
introduce
some
kind
of
discourse
proved
her
to
be
more
truly
well
bred
than
either
of
the
others;
and
between
her
and
Mrs.
Gardiner,
with
occasional
help
from
Elizabeth,
the
conversation
was
carried
on.
Miss
Darcy
looked
as
if
she
wished
for
courage
enough
to
join
in
it;
and
sometimes
did
venture
a
short
sentence
when
there
was
least
danger
of
its
being
heard.
Elizabeth
soon
saw
that
she
was
herself
closely
watched
by
Miss
Bingley,
and
that
she
could
not
speak
a
word,
especially
to
Miss
Darcy,
without
calling
her
attention.
This
observation
would
not
have
prevented
her
from
trying
to
talk
to
the
latter,
had
they
not
been
seated
at
an
inconvenient
distance;
but
she
was
not
sorry
to
be
spared
the
necessity
of
saying
much.
Her
own
thoughts
were
employing
her.
She
expected
every
moment
that
some
of
the
gentlemen
would
enter
the
room.
She
wished,
she
feared
that
the
master
of
the
house
might
be
amongst
them;
and
whether
she
wished
or
feared
it
most,
she
could
scarcely
determine.
After
sitting
in
this
manner
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
hearing
Miss
Bingley's
voice,
Elizabeth
was
roused
by
receiving
from
her
a
cold
inquiry
after
the
health
of
her
family.
She
answered
with
equal
indifference
and
brevity,
and
the
other
said
no
more.
The
next
variation
which
their
visit
afforded
was
produced
by
the
entrance
of
servants
with
cold
meat,
cake,
and
a
variety
of
all
the
finest
fruits
in
season;
but
this
did
not
take
place
till
after
many
a
significant
look
and
smile
from
Mrs.
Annesley
to
Miss
Darcy
had
been
given,
to
remind
her
of
her
post.
There
was
now
employment
for
the
whole
party
for
though
they
could
not
all
talk,
they
could
all
eat;
and
the
beautiful
pyramids
of
grapes,
nectarines,
and
peaches
soon
collected
them
round
the
table.
While
thus
engaged,
Elizabeth
had
a
fair
opportunity
of
deciding
whether
she
most
feared
or
wished
for
the
appearance
of
Mr.
Darcy,
by
the
feelings
which
prevailed
on
his
entering
the
room;
and
then,
though
but
a
moment
before
she
had
believed
her
wishes
to
predominate,
she
began
to
regret
that
he
came.
He
had
been
some
time
with
Mr.
Gardiner,
who,
with
two
or
three
other
gentlemen
from
the
house,
was
engaged
by
the
river,
and
had
left
him
only
on
learning
that
the
ladies
of
the
family
intended
a
visit
to
Georgiana
that
morning.
