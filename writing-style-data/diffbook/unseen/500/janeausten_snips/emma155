please.
But
then,
Mrs.
Goddard
will
want
to
see
it.
And
I
could
take
the
pattern
gown
home
any
day.
But
I
shall
want
the
ribbon
directly
so
it
had
better
go
to
Hartfield
at
least
the
ribbon.
You
could
make
it
into
two
parcels,
Mrs.
Ford,
could
not
you?"
"It
is
not
worth
while,
Harriet,
to
give
Mrs.
Ford
the
trouble
of
two
parcels."
"No
more
it
is."
"No
trouble
in
the
world,
ma'am,"
said
the
obliging
Mrs.
Ford.
"Oh!
but
indeed
I
would
much
rather
have
it
only
in
one.
Then,
if
you
please,
you
shall
send
it
all
to
Mrs.
Goddard's
I
do
not
know
No,
I
think,
Miss
Woodhouse,
I
may
just
as
well
have
it
sent
to
Hartfield,
and
take
it
home
with
me
at
night.
What
do
you
advise?"
"That
you
do
not
give
another
half
second
to
the
subject.
To
Hartfield,
if
you
please,
Mrs.
Ford."
"Aye,
that
will
be
much
best,"
said
Harriet,
quite
satisfied,
"I
should
not
at
all
like
to
have
it
sent
to
Mrs.
Goddard's."
Voices
approached
the
shop
or
rather
one
voice
and
two
ladies:
Mrs.
Weston
and
Miss
Bates
met
them
at
the
door.
"My
dear
Miss
Woodhouse,"
said
the
latter,
"I
am
just
run
across
to
entreat
the
favour
of
you
to
come
and
sit
down
with
us
a
little
while,
and
give
us
your
opinion
of
our
new
instrument;
you
and
Miss
Smith.
How
do
you
do,
Miss
Smith?
Very
well
I
thank
you.
And
I
begged
Mrs.
Weston
to
come
with
me,
that
I
might
be
sure
of
succeeding."
"I
hope
Mrs.
Bates
and
Miss
Fairfax
are
"
"Very
well,
I
am
much
obliged
to
you.
My
mother
is
delightfully
well;
and
Jane
caught
no
cold
last
night.
How
is
Mr.
Woodhouse?
I
am
so
glad
to
hear
such
a
good
account.
Mrs.
Weston
told
me
you
were
here.
Oh!
then,
said
I,
I
must
run
across,
I
am
sure
Miss
Woodhouse
will
allow
me
just
to
run
across
and
entreat
her
to
come
in;
my
mother
will
be
so
very
happy
to
see
her
and
now
we
are
such
a
nice
party,
she
cannot
refuse.
'Aye,
pray
do,'
said
Mr.
Frank
Churchill,
'Miss
Woodhouse's
opinion
of
the
instrument
will
be
worth
having.'
But,
said
I,
I
shall
be
more
sure
of
succeeding
if
one
of
you
will
go
with
me.
'Oh,'
said
he,
'wait
half
a
minute,
till
I
have
finished
my
job;'
For,
would
you
believe
it,
Miss
Woodhouse,
there
he
is,
in
the
most
obliging
manner
in
the
world,
fastening
in
the
rivet
of
my
mother's
spectacles.
The
rivet
came
out,
you
know,
this
morning.
So
very
obliging!
For
my
mother
had
no
use
of
her
spectacles
could
not
put
them
on.
And,
by
the
bye,
every
body
ought
to
have
two
pair
of
spectacles;
they
should
indeed.
Jane
said
so.
I
meant
to
take
them
over
to
John
Saunders
the
first
thing
I
did,
but
something
or
other
hindered
me
