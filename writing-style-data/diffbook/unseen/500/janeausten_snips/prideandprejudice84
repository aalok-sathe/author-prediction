regard
had
really
died
away,
or
were
suppressed
by
his
friends'
interference;
whether
he
had
been
aware
of
Jane's
attachment,
or
whether
it
had
escaped
his
observation;
whatever
were
the
case,
though
her
opinion
of
him
must
be
materially
affected
by
the
difference,
her
sister's
situation
remained
the
same,
her
peace
equally
wounded.
A
day
or
two
passed
before
Jane
had
courage
to
speak
of
her
feelings
to
Elizabeth;
but
at
last,
on
Mrs.
Bennet's
leaving
them
together,
after
a
longer
irritation
than
usual
about
Netherfield
and
its
master,
she
could
not
help
saying:
"Oh,
that
my
dear
mother
had
more
command
over
herself!
She
can
have
no
idea
of
the
pain
she
gives
me
by
her
continual
reflections
on
him.
But
I
will
not
repine.
It
cannot
last
long.
He
will
be
forgot,
and
we
shall
all
be
as
we
were
before."
Elizabeth
looked
at
her
sister
with
incredulous
solicitude,
but
said
nothing.
"You
doubt
me,"
cried
Jane,
slightly
colouring;
"indeed,
you
have
no
reason.
He
may
live
in
my
memory
as
the
most
amiable
man
of
my
acquaintance,
but
that
is
all.
I
have
nothing
either
to
hope
or
fear,
and
nothing
to
reproach
him
with.
Thank
God!
I
have
not
that
pain.
A
little
time,
therefore
I
shall
certainly
try
to
get
the
better."
With
a
stronger
voice
she
soon
added,
"I
have
this
comfort
immediately,
that
it
has
not
been
more
than
an
error
of
fancy
on
my
side,
and
that
it
has
done
no
harm
to
anyone
but
myself."
"My
dear
Jane!"
exclaimed
Elizabeth,
"you
are
too
good.
Your
sweetness
and
disinterestedness
are
really
angelic;
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
you.
I
feel
as
if
I
had
never
done
you
justice,
or
loved
you
as
you
deserve."
Miss
Bennet
eagerly
disclaimed
all
extraordinary
merit,
and
threw
back
the
praise
on
her
sister's
warm
affection.
"Nay,"
said
Elizabeth,
"this
is
not
fair.
You
wish
to
think
all
the
world
respectable,
and
are
hurt
if
I
speak
ill
of
anybody.
I
only
want
to
think
you
perfect,
and
you
set
yourself
against
it.
Do
not
be
afraid
of
my
running
into
any
excess,
of
my
encroaching
on
your
privilege
of
universal
good
will.
You
need
not.
There
are
few
people
whom
I
really
love,
and
still
fewer
of
whom
I
think
well.
The
more
I
see
of
the
world,
the
more
am
I
dissatisfied
with
it;
and
every
day
confirms
my
belief
of
the
inconsistency
of
all
human
characters,
and
of
the
little
dependence
that
can
be
placed
on
the
appearance
of
merit
or
sense.
I
have
met
with
two
instances
lately,
one
I
will
not
mention;
the
other
is
Charlotte's
marriage.
It
is
unaccountable!
In
every
view
it
is
unaccountable!"
"My
dear
Lizzy,
do
not
give
way
to
such
feelings
as
these.
They
will
ruin
your
happiness.
You
do
not
make
allowance
enough
for
difference
of
situation
and
temper.
Consider
Mr.
Collins's
respectability,
and
Charlotte's
steady,
prudent
character.
Remember
that
she
is
one
