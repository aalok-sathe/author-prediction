in
his
being
so
at
last.
Do
not
beat
me."
Every
body
in
and
about
Highbury
who
had
ever
visited
Mr.
Elton,
was
disposed
to
pay
him
attention
on
his
marriage.
Dinner
parties
and
evening
parties
were
made
for
him
and
his
lady;
and
invitations
flowed
in
so
fast
that
she
had
soon
the
pleasure
of
apprehending
they
were
never
to
have
a
disengaged
day.
"I
see
how
it
is,"
said
she.
"I
see
what
a
life
I
am
to
lead
among
you.
Upon
my
word
we
shall
be
absolutely
dissipated.
We
really
seem
quite
the
fashion.
If
this
is
living
in
the
country,
it
is
nothing
very
formidable.
From
Monday
next
to
Saturday,
I
assure
you
we
have
not
a
disengaged
day!
A
woman
with
fewer
resources
than
I
have,
need
not
have
been
at
a
loss."
No
invitation
came
amiss
to
her.
Her
Bath
habits
made
evening
parties
perfectly
natural
to
her,
and
Maple
Grove
had
given
her
a
taste
for
dinners.
She
was
a
little
shocked
at
the
want
of
two
drawing
rooms,
at
the
poor
attempt
at
rout
cakes,
and
there
being
no
ice
in
the
Highbury
card
parties.
Mrs.
Bates,
Mrs.
Perry,
Mrs.
Goddard
and
others,
were
a
good
deal
behind
hand
in
knowledge
of
the
world,
but
she
would
soon
shew
them
how
every
thing
ought
to
be
arranged.
In
the
course
of
the
spring
she
must
return
their
civilities
by
one
very
superior
party
in
which
her
card
tables
should
be
set
out
with
their
separate
candles
and
unbroken
packs
in
the
true
style
and
more
waiters
engaged
for
the
evening
than
their
own
establishment
could
furnish,
to
carry
round
the
refreshments
at
exactly
the
proper
hour,
and
in
the
proper
order.
Emma,
in
the
meanwhile,
could
not
be
satisfied
without
a
dinner
at
Hartfield
for
the
Eltons.
They
must
not
do
less
than
others,
or
she
should
be
exposed
to
odious
suspicions,
and
imagined
capable
of
pitiful
resentment.
A
dinner
there
must
be.
After
Emma
had
talked
about
it
for
ten
minutes,
Mr.
Woodhouse
felt
no
unwillingness,
and
only
made
the
usual
stipulation
of
not
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
himself,
with
the
usual
regular
difficulty
of
deciding
who
should
do
it
for
him.
The
persons
to
be
invited,
required
little
thought.
Besides
the
Eltons,
it
must
be
the
Westons
and
Mr.
Knightley;
so
far
it
was
all
of
course
and
it
was
hardly
less
inevitable
that
poor
little
Harriet
must
be
asked
to
make
the
eighth:
but
this
invitation
was
not
given
with
equal
satisfaction,
and
on
many
accounts
Emma
was
particularly
pleased
by
Harriet's
begging
to
be
allowed
to
decline
it.
"She
would
rather
not
be
in
his
company
more
than
she
could
help.
She
was
not
yet
quite
able
to
see
him
and
his
charming
happy
wife
together,
without
feeling
uncomfortable.
If
Miss
Woodhouse
would
not
be
displeased,
she
would
rather
stay
at
home."
It
was
precisely
what
Emma
would
have
wished,
had
she
deemed
it
possible
