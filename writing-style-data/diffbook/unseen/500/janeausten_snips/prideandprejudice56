moment
of
her
release
from
him
was
ecstasy.
She
danced
next
with
an
officer,
and
had
the
refreshment
of
talking
of
Wickham,
and
of
hearing
that
he
was
universally
liked.
When
those
dances
were
over,
she
returned
to
Charlotte
Lucas,
and
was
in
conversation
with
her,
when
she
found
herself
suddenly
addressed
by
Mr.
Darcy
who
took
her
so
much
by
surprise
in
his
application
for
her
hand,
that,
without
knowing
what
she
did,
she
accepted
him.
He
walked
away
again
immediately,
and
she
was
left
to
fret
over
her
own
want
of
presence
of
mind;
Charlotte
tried
to
console
her:
"I
dare
say
you
will
find
him
very
agreeable."
"Heaven
forbid!
That
would
be
the
greatest
misfortune
of
all!
To
find
a
man
agreeable
whom
one
is
determined
to
hate!
Do
not
wish
me
such
an
evil."
When
the
dancing
recommenced,
however,
and
Darcy
approached
to
claim
her
hand,
Charlotte
could
not
help
cautioning
her
in
a
whisper,
not
to
be
a
simpleton,
and
allow
her
fancy
for
Wickham
to
make
her
appear
unpleasant
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
ten
times
his
consequence.
Elizabeth
made
no
answer,
and
took
her
place
in
the
set,
amazed
at
the
dignity
to
which
she
was
arrived
in
being
allowed
to
stand
opposite
to
Mr.
Darcy,
and
reading
in
her
neighbours'
looks,
their
equal
amazement
in
beholding
it.
They
stood
for
some
time
without
speaking
a
word;
and
she
began
to
imagine
that
their
silence
was
to
last
through
the
two
dances,
and
at
first
was
resolved
not
to
break
it;
till
suddenly
fancying
that
it
would
be
the
greater
punishment
to
her
partner
to
oblige
him
to
talk,
she
made
some
slight
observation
on
the
dance.
He
replied,
and
was
again
silent.
After
a
pause
of
some
minutes,
she
addressed
him
a
second
time
with:
"It
is
your
turn
to
say
something
now,
Mr.
Darcy.
I
talked
about
the
dance,
and
you
ought
to
make
some
sort
of
remark
on
the
size
of
the
room,
or
the
number
of
couples."
He
smiled,
and
assured
her
that
whatever
she
wished
him
to
say
should
be
said.
"Very
well.
That
reply
will
do
for
the
present.
Perhaps
by
and
by
I
may
observe
that
private
balls
are
much
pleasanter
than
public
ones.
But
now
we
may
be
silent."
"Do
you
talk
by
rule,
then,
while
you
are
dancing?"
"Sometimes.
One
must
speak
a
little,
you
know.
It
would
look
odd
to
be
entirely
silent
for
half
an
hour
together;
and
yet
for
the
advantage
of
some,
conversation
ought
to
be
so
arranged,
as
that
they
may
have
the
trouble
of
saying
as
little
as
possible."
"Are
you
consulting
your
own
feelings
in
the
present
case,
or
do
you
imagine
that
you
are
gratifying
mine?"
"Both,"
replied
Elizabeth
archly;
"for
I
have
always
seen
a
great
similarity
in
the
turn
of
our
minds.
We
are
each
of
an
unsocial,
taciturn
disposition,
unwilling
to
speak,
unless
we
expect
to
say
something
that
will
amaze
the
