boot,
and
fall
behind
to
arrange
it
once
more.
She
then
broke
the
lace
off
short,
and
dexterously
throwing
it
into
a
ditch,
was
presently
obliged
to
entreat
them
to
stop,
and
acknowledged
her
inability
to
put
herself
to
rights
so
as
to
be
able
to
walk
home
in
tolerable
comfort.
"Part
of
my
lace
is
gone,"
said
she,
"and
I
do
not
know
how
I
am
to
contrive.
I
really
am
a
most
troublesome
companion
to
you
both,
but
I
hope
I
am
not
often
so
ill
equipped.
Mr.
Elton,
I
must
beg
leave
to
stop
at
your
house,
and
ask
your
housekeeper
for
a
bit
of
ribband
or
string,
or
any
thing
just
to
keep
my
boot
on."
Mr.
Elton
looked
all
happiness
at
this
proposition;
and
nothing
could
exceed
his
alertness
and
attention
in
conducting
them
into
his
house
and
endeavouring
to
make
every
thing
appear
to
advantage.
The
room
they
were
taken
into
was
the
one
he
chiefly
occupied,
and
looking
forwards;
behind
it
was
another
with
which
it
immediately
communicated;
the
door
between
them
was
open,
and
Emma
passed
into
it
with
the
housekeeper
to
receive
her
assistance
in
the
most
comfortable
manner.
She
was
obliged
to
leave
the
door
ajar
as
she
found
it;
but
she
fully
intended
that
Mr.
Elton
should
close
it.
It
was
not
closed,
however,
it
still
remained
ajar;
but
by
engaging
the
housekeeper
in
incessant
conversation,
she
hoped
to
make
it
practicable
for
him
to
chuse
his
own
subject
in
the
adjoining
room.
For
ten
minutes
she
could
hear
nothing
but
herself.
It
could
be
protracted
no
longer.
She
was
then
obliged
to
be
finished,
and
make
her
appearance.
The
lovers
were
standing
together
at
one
of
the
windows.
It
had
a
most
favourable
aspect;
and,
for
half
a
minute,
Emma
felt
the
glory
of
having
schemed
successfully.
But
it
would
not
do;
he
had
not
come
to
the
point.
He
had
been
most
agreeable,
most
delightful;
he
had
told
Harriet
that
he
had
seen
them
go
by,
and
had
purposely
followed
them;
other
little
gallantries
and
allusions
had
been
dropt,
but
nothing
serious.
"Cautious,
very
cautious,"
thought
Emma;
"he
advances
inch
by
inch,
and
will
hazard
nothing
till
he
believes
himself
secure."
Still,
however,
though
every
thing
had
not
been
accomplished
by
her
ingenious
device,
she
could
not
but
flatter
herself
that
it
had
been
the
occasion
of
much
present
enjoyment
to
both,
and
must
be
leading
them
forward
to
the
great
event.
Mr.
Elton
must
now
be
left
to
himself.
It
was
no
longer
in
Emma's
power
to
superintend
his
happiness
or
quicken
his
measures.
The
coming
of
her
sister's
family
was
so
very
near
at
hand,
that
first
in
anticipation,
and
then
in
reality,
it
became
henceforth
her
prime
object
of
interest;
and
during
the
ten
days
of
their
stay
at
Hartfield
it
was
not
to
be
expected
she
did
not
herself
expect
that
any
thing
beyond
occasional,
fortuitous
assistance
could
be
afforded
by
her
to
