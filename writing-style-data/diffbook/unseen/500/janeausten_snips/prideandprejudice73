to
Meryton
to
inquire
if
Mr.
Wickham
were
returned,
and
to
lament
over
his
absence
from
the
Netherfield
ball.
He
joined
them
on
their
entering
the
town,
and
attended
them
to
their
aunt's
where
his
regret
and
vexation,
and
the
concern
of
everybody,
was
well
talked
over.
To
Elizabeth,
however,
he
voluntarily
acknowledged
that
the
necessity
of
his
absence
had
been
self
imposed.
"I
found,"
said
he,
"as
the
time
drew
near
that
I
had
better
not
meet
Mr.
Darcy;
that
to
be
in
the
same
room,
the
same
party
with
him
for
so
many
hours
together,
might
be
more
than
I
could
bear,
and
that
scenes
might
arise
unpleasant
to
more
than
myself."
She
highly
approved
his
forbearance,
and
they
had
leisure
for
a
full
discussion
of
it,
and
for
all
the
commendation
which
they
civilly
bestowed
on
each
other,
as
Wickham
and
another
officer
walked
back
with
them
to
Longbourn,
and
during
the
walk
he
particularly
attended
to
her.
His
accompanying
them
was
a
double
advantage;
she
felt
all
the
compliment
it
offered
to
herself,
and
it
was
most
acceptable
as
an
occasion
of
introducing
him
to
her
father
and
mother.
Soon
after
their
return,
a
letter
was
delivered
to
Miss
Bennet;
it
came
from
Netherfield.
The
envelope
contained
a
sheet
of
elegant,
little,
hot
pressed
paper,
well
covered
with
a
lady's
fair,
flowing
hand;
and
Elizabeth
saw
her
sister's
countenance
change
as
she
read
it,
and
saw
her
dwelling
intently
on
some
particular
passages.
Jane
recollected
herself
soon,
and
putting
the
letter
away,
tried
to
join
with
her
usual
cheerfulness
in
the
general
conversation;
but
Elizabeth
felt
an
anxiety
on
the
subject
which
drew
off
her
attention
even
from
Wickham;
and
no
sooner
had
he
and
his
companion
taken
leave,
than
a
glance
from
Jane
invited
her
to
follow
her
up
stairs.
When
they
had
gained
their
own
room,
Jane,
taking
out
the
letter,
said:
"This
is
from
Caroline
Bingley;
what
it
contains
has
surprised
me
a
good
deal.
The
whole
party
have
left
Netherfield
by
this
time,
and
are
on
their
way
to
town
and
without
any
intention
of
coming
back
again.
You
shall
hear
what
she
says."
She
then
read
the
first
sentence
aloud,
which
comprised
the
information
of
their
having
just
resolved
to
follow
their
brother
to
town
directly,
and
of
their
meaning
to
dine
in
Grosvenor
Street,
where
Mr.
Hurst
had
a
house.
The
next
was
in
these
words:
"I
do
not
pretend
to
regret
anything
I
shall
leave
in
Hertfordshire,
except
your
society,
my
dearest
friend;
but
we
will
hope,
at
some
future
period,
to
enjoy
many
returns
of
that
delightful
intercourse
we
have
known,
and
in
the
meanwhile
may
lessen
the
pain
of
separation
by
a
very
frequent
and
most
unreserved
correspondence.
I
depend
on
you
for
that."
To
these
highflown
expressions
Elizabeth
listened
with
all
the
insensibility
of
distrust;
and
though
the
suddenness
of
their
removal
surprised
her,
she
saw
nothing
in
it
really
to
lament;
it
was
not
to
