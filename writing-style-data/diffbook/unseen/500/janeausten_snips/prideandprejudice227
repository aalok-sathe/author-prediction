dignity,
he
would
probably
feel
that
the
arguments,
which
to
Elizabeth
had
appeared
weak
and
ridiculous,
contained
much
good
sense
and
solid
reasoning.
If
he
had
been
wavering
before
as
to
what
he
should
do,
which
had
often
seemed
likely,
the
advice
and
entreaty
of
so
near
a
relation
might
settle
every
doubt,
and
determine
him
at
once
to
be
as
happy
as
dignity
unblemished
could
make
him.
In
that
case
he
would
return
no
more.
Lady
Catherine
might
see
him
in
her
way
through
town;
and
his
engagement
to
Bingley
of
coming
again
to
Netherfield
must
give
way.
"If,
therefore,
an
excuse
for
not
keeping
his
promise
should
come
to
his
friend
within
a
few
days,"
she
added,
"I
shall
know
how
to
understand
it.
I
shall
then
give
over
every
expectation,
every
wish
of
his
constancy.
If
he
is
satisfied
with
only
regretting
me,
when
he
might
have
obtained
my
affections
and
hand,
I
shall
soon
cease
to
regret
him
at
all."
The
surprise
of
the
rest
of
the
family,
on
hearing
who
their
visitor
had
been,
was
very
great;
but
they
obligingly
satisfied
it,
with
the
same
kind
of
supposition
which
had
appeased
Mrs.
Bennet's
curiosity;
and
Elizabeth
was
spared
from
much
teasing
on
the
subject.
The
next
morning,
as
she
was
going
downstairs,
she
was
met
by
her
father,
who
came
out
of
his
library
with
a
letter
in
his
hand.
"Lizzy,"
said
he,
"I
was
going
to
look
for
you;
come
into
my
room."
She
followed
him
thither;
and
her
curiosity
to
know
what
he
had
to
tell
her
was
heightened
by
the
supposition
of
its
being
in
some
manner
connected
with
the
letter
he
held.
It
suddenly
struck
her
that
it
might
be
from
Lady
Catherine;
and
she
anticipated
with
dismay
all
the
consequent
explanations.
She
followed
her
father
to
the
fire
place,
and
they
both
sat
down.
He
then
said,
"I
have
received
a
letter
this
morning
that
has
astonished
me
exceedingly.
As
it
principally
concerns
yourself,
you
ought
to
know
its
contents.
I
did
not
know
before,
that
I
had
two
daughters
on
the
brink
of
matrimony.
Let
me
congratulate
you
on
a
very
important
conquest."
The
colour
now
rushed
into
Elizabeth's
cheeks
in
the
instantaneous
conviction
of
its
being
a
letter
from
the
nephew,
instead
of
the
aunt;
and
she
was
undetermined
whether
most
to
be
pleased
that
he
explained
himself
at
all,
or
offended
that
his
letter
was
not
rather
addressed
to
herself;
when
her
father
continued:
"You
look
conscious.
Young
ladies
have
great
penetration
in
such
matters
as
these;
but
I
think
I
may
defy
even
your
sagacity,
to
discover
the
name
of
your
admirer.
This
letter
is
from
Mr.
Collins."
"From
Mr.
Collins!
and
what
can
he
have
to
say?"
"Something
very
much
to
the
purpose
of
course.
He
begins
with
congratulations
on
the
approaching
nuptials
of
my
eldest
daughter,
of
which,
it
seems,
he
has
been
told
by
some
of
the
good
natured,
gossiping
Lucases.
I
