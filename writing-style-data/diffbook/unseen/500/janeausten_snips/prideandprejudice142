merely
be
able
to
tell
what
Bingley
may
tell
in
a
much
more
agreeable
manner
himself.
The
liberty
of
communication
cannot
be
mine
till
it
has
lost
all
its
value!"
She
was
now,
on
being
settled
at
home,
at
leisure
to
observe
the
real
state
of
her
sister's
spirits.
Jane
was
not
happy.
She
still
cherished
a
very
tender
affection
for
Bingley.
Having
never
even
fancied
herself
in
love
before,
her
regard
had
all
the
warmth
of
first
attachment,
and,
from
her
age
and
disposition,
greater
steadiness
than
most
first
attachments
often
boast;
and
so
fervently
did
she
value
his
remembrance,
and
prefer
him
to
every
other
man,
that
all
her
good
sense,
and
all
her
attention
to
the
feelings
of
her
friends,
were
requisite
to
check
the
indulgence
of
those
regrets
which
must
have
been
injurious
to
her
own
health
and
their
tranquillity.
"Well,
Lizzy,"
said
Mrs.
Bennet
one
day,
"what
is
your
opinion
now
of
this
sad
business
of
Jane's?
For
my
part,
I
am
determined
never
to
speak
of
it
again
to
anybody.
I
told
my
sister
Phillips
so
the
other
day.
But
I
cannot
find
out
that
Jane
saw
anything
of
him
in
London.
Well,
he
is
a
very
undeserving
young
man
and
I
do
not
suppose
there's
the
least
chance
in
the
world
of
her
ever
getting
him
now.
There
is
no
talk
of
his
coming
to
Netherfield
again
in
the
summer;
and
I
have
inquired
of
everybody,
too,
who
is
likely
to
know."
"I
do
not
believe
he
will
ever
live
at
Netherfield
any
more."
"Oh
well!
it
is
just
as
he
chooses.
Nobody
wants
him
to
come.
Though
I
shall
always
say
he
used
my
daughter
extremely
ill;
and
if
I
was
her,
I
would
not
have
put
up
with
it.
Well,
my
comfort
is,
I
am
sure
Jane
will
die
of
a
broken
heart;
and
then
he
will
be
sorry
for
what
he
has
done."
But
as
Elizabeth
could
not
receive
comfort
from
any
such
expectation,
she
made
no
answer.
"Well,
Lizzy,"
continued
her
mother,
soon
afterwards,
"and
so
the
Collinses
live
very
comfortable,
do
they?
Well,
well,
I
only
hope
it
will
last.
And
what
sort
of
table
do
they
keep?
Charlotte
is
an
excellent
manager,
I
dare
say.
If
she
is
half
as
sharp
as
her
mother,
she
is
saving
enough.
There
is
nothing
extravagant
in
their
housekeeping,
I
dare
say."
"No,
nothing
at
all."
"A
great
deal
of
good
management,
depend
upon
it.
Yes,
yes,
they
will
take
care
not
to
outrun
their
income.
They
will
never
be
distressed
for
money.
Well,
much
good
may
it
do
them!
And
so,
I
suppose,
they
often
talk
of
having
Longbourn
when
your
father
is
dead.
They
look
upon
it
as
quite
their
own,
I
dare
say,
whenever
that
happens."
"It
was
a
subject
which
they
could
not
mention
before
me."
"No;
it
would
have
been
strange
if
they
had;
but
I
make
no
doubt
they
often
talk
of
it
between
themselves.
