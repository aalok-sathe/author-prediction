this
wind.
Why
does
she
not
come
in?"
"Oh,
Charlotte
says
she
hardly
ever
does.
It
is
the
greatest
of
favours
when
Miss
de
Bourgh
comes
in."
"I
like
her
appearance,"
said
Elizabeth,
struck
with
other
ideas.
"She
looks
sickly
and
cross.
Yes,
she
will
do
for
him
very
well.
She
will
make
him
a
very
proper
wife."
Mr.
Collins
and
Charlotte
were
both
standing
at
the
gate
in
conversation
with
the
ladies;
and
Sir
William,
to
Elizabeth's
high
diversion,
was
stationed
in
the
doorway,
in
earnest
contemplation
of
the
greatness
before
him,
and
constantly
bowing
whenever
Miss
de
Bourgh
looked
that
way.
At
length
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said;
the
ladies
drove
on,
and
the
others
returned
into
the
house.
Mr.
Collins
no
sooner
saw
the
two
girls
than
he
began
to
congratulate
them
on
their
good
fortune,
which
Charlotte
explained
by
letting
them
know
that
the
whole
party
was
asked
to
dine
at
Rosings
the
next
day.
Mr.
Collins's
triumph,
in
consequence
of
this
invitation,
was
complete.
The
power
of
displaying
the
grandeur
of
his
patroness
to
his
wondering
visitors,
and
of
letting
them
see
her
civility
towards
himself
and
his
wife,
was
exactly
what
he
had
wished
for;
and
that
an
opportunity
of
doing
it
should
be
given
so
soon,
was
such
an
instance
of
Lady
Catherine's
condescension,
as
he
knew
not
how
to
admire
enough.
"I
confess,"
said
he,
"that
I
should
not
have
been
at
all
surprised
by
her
ladyship's
asking
us
on
Sunday
to
drink
tea
and
spend
the
evening
at
Rosings.
I
rather
expected,
from
my
knowledge
of
her
affability,
that
it
would
happen.
But
who
could
have
foreseen
such
an
attention
as
this?
Who
could
have
imagined
that
we
should
receive
an
invitation
to
dine
there
(an
invitation,
moreover,
including
the
whole
party)
so
immediately
after
your
arrival!"
"I
am
the
less
surprised
at
what
has
happened,"
replied
Sir
William,
"from
that
knowledge
of
what
the
manners
of
the
great
really
are,
which
my
situation
in
life
has
allowed
me
to
acquire.
About
the
court,
such
instances
of
elegant
breeding
are
not
uncommon."
Scarcely
anything
was
talked
of
the
whole
day
or
next
morning
but
their
visit
to
Rosings.
Mr.
Collins
was
carefully
instructing
them
in
what
they
were
to
expect,
that
the
sight
of
such
rooms,
so
many
servants,
and
so
splendid
a
dinner,
might
not
wholly
overpower
them.
When
the
ladies
were
separating
for
the
toilette,
he
said
to
Elizabeth
"Do
not
make
yourself
uneasy,
my
dear
cousin,
about
your
apparel.
Lady
Catherine
is
far
from
requiring
that
elegance
of
dress
in
us
which
becomes
herself
and
her
daughter.
I
would
advise
you
merely
to
put
on
whatever
of
your
clothes
is
superior
to
the
rest
there
is
no
occasion
for
anything
more.
Lady
Catherine
will
not
think
the
worse
of
you
for
being
simply
dressed.
She
likes
to
have
the
distinction
of
rank
preserved."
While
they
were
dressing,
he
came
two
or
three
times
to
their
different
