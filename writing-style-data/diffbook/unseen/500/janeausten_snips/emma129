oftener
than
Emma
could
have
supposed.
Some
of
the
objects
of
his
curiosity
spoke
very
amiable
feelings.
He
begged
to
be
shewn
the
house
which
his
father
had
lived
in
so
long,
and
which
had
been
the
home
of
his
father's
father;
and
on
recollecting
that
an
old
woman
who
had
nursed
him
was
still
living,
walked
in
quest
of
her
cottage
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other;
and
though
in
some
points
of
pursuit
or
observation
there
was
no
positive
merit,
they
shewed,
altogether,
a
good
will
towards
Highbury
in
general,
which
must
be
very
like
a
merit
to
those
he
was
with.
Emma
watched
and
decided,
that
with
such
feelings
as
were
now
shewn,
it
could
not
be
fairly
supposed
that
he
had
been
ever
voluntarily
absenting
himself;
that
he
had
not
been
acting
a
part,
or
making
a
parade
of
insincere
professions;
and
that
Mr.
Knightley
certainly
had
not
done
him
justice.
Their
first
pause
was
at
the
Crown
Inn,
an
inconsiderable
house,
though
the
principal
one
of
the
sort,
where
a
couple
of
pair
of
post
horses
were
kept,
more
for
the
convenience
of
the
neighbourhood
than
from
any
run
on
the
road;
and
his
companions
had
not
expected
to
be
detained
by
any
interest
excited
there;
but
in
passing
it
they
gave
the
history
of
the
large
room
visibly
added;
it
had
been
built
many
years
ago
for
a
ball
room,
and
while
the
neighbourhood
had
been
in
a
particularly
populous,
dancing
state,
had
been
occasionally
used
as
such;
but
such
brilliant
days
had
long
passed
away,
and
now
the
highest
purpose
for
which
it
was
ever
wanted
was
to
accommodate
a
whist
club
established
among
the
gentlemen
and
half
gentlemen
of
the
place.
He
was
immediately
interested.
Its
character
as
a
ball
room
caught
him;
and
instead
of
passing
on,
he
stopt
for
several
minutes
at
the
two
superior
sashed
windows
which
were
open,
to
look
in
and
contemplate
its
capabilities,
and
lament
that
its
original
purpose
should
have
ceased.
He
saw
no
fault
in
the
room,
he
would
acknowledge
none
which
they
suggested.
No,
it
was
long
enough,
broad
enough,
handsome
enough.
It
would
hold
the
very
number
for
comfort.
They
ought
to
have
balls
there
at
least
every
fortnight
through
the
winter.
Why
had
not
Miss
Woodhouse
revived
the
former
good
old
days
of
the
room?
She
who
could
do
any
thing
in
Highbury!
The
want
of
proper
families
in
the
place,
and
the
conviction
that
none
beyond
the
place
and
its
immediate
environs
could
be
tempted
to
attend,
were
mentioned;
but
he
was
not
satisfied.
He
could
not
be
persuaded
that
so
many
good
looking
houses
as
he
saw
around
him,
could
not
furnish
numbers
enough
for
such
a
meeting;
and
even
when
particulars
were
given
and
families
described,
he
was
still
unwilling
to
admit
that
the
inconvenience
of
such
a
mixture
would
be
any
thing,
or
that
there
would
be
the
smallest
difficulty
in
every
body's
returning
