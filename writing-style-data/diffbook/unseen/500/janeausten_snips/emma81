if
she
fall
into
bad
hands,
may
be
teased,
and
kept
at
a
distance
from
those
she
wants
to
be
with;
but
one
cannot
comprehend
a
young
man's
being
under
such
restraint,
as
not
to
be
able
to
spend
a
week
with
his
father,
if
he
likes
it."
"One
ought
to
be
at
Enscombe,
and
know
the
ways
of
the
family,
before
one
decides
upon
what
he
can
do,"
replied
Mrs.
Weston.
"One
ought
to
use
the
same
caution,
perhaps,
in
judging
of
the
conduct
of
any
one
individual
of
any
one
family;
but
Enscombe,
I
believe,
certainly
must
not
be
judged
by
general
rules:
she
is
so
very
unreasonable;
and
every
thing
gives
way
to
her."
"But
she
is
so
fond
of
the
nephew:
he
is
so
very
great
a
favourite.
Now,
according
to
my
idea
of
Mrs.
Churchill,
it
would
be
most
natural,
that
while
she
makes
no
sacrifice
for
the
comfort
of
the
husband,
to
whom
she
owes
every
thing,
while
she
exercises
incessant
caprice
towards
him,
she
should
frequently
be
governed
by
the
nephew,
to
whom
she
owes
nothing
at
all."
"My
dearest
Emma,
do
not
pretend,
with
your
sweet
temper,
to
understand
a
bad
one,
or
to
lay
down
rules
for
it:
you
must
let
it
go
its
own
way.
I
have
no
doubt
of
his
having,
at
times,
considerable
influence;
but
it
may
be
perfectly
impossible
for
him
to
know
beforehand
when
it
will
be."
Emma
listened,
and
then
coolly
said,
"I
shall
not
be
satisfied,
unless
he
comes."
"He
may
have
a
great
deal
of
influence
on
some
points,"
continued
Mrs.
Weston,
"and
on
others,
very
little:
and
among
those,
on
which
she
is
beyond
his
reach,
it
is
but
too
likely,
may
be
this
very
circumstance
of
his
coming
away
from
them
to
visit
us."
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
soon
ready
for
his
tea;
and
when
he
had
drank
his
tea
he
was
quite
ready
to
go
home;
and
it
was
as
much
as
his
three
companions
could
do,
to
entertain
away
his
notice
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour,
before
the
other
gentlemen
appeared.
Mr.
Weston
was
chatty
and
convivial,
and
no
friend
to
early
separations
of
any
sort;
but
at
last
the
drawing
room
party
did
receive
an
augmentation.
Mr.
Elton,
in
very
good
spirits,
was
one
of
the
first
to
walk
in.
Mrs.
Weston
and
Emma
were
sitting
together
on
a
sofa.
He
joined
them
immediately,
and,
with
scarcely
an
invitation,
seated
himself
between
them.
Emma,
in
good
spirits
too,
from
the
amusement
afforded
her
mind
by
the
expectation
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill,
was
willing
to
forget
his
late
improprieties,
and
be
as
well
satisfied
with
him
as
before,
and
on
his
making
Harriet
his
very
first
subject,
was
ready
to
listen
with
most
friendly
smiles.
He
professed
himself
extremely
anxious
about
her
fair
friend
her
fair,
lovely,
amiable
friend.
"Did
she
know?
had
she
heard
any
thing
about
her,
since
their
being
at
Randalls?
he
felt
much
anxiety
