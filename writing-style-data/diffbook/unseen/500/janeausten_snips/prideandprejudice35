not,
I
hope,
of
understanding.
My
temper
I
dare
not
vouch
for.
It
is,
I
believe,
too
little
yielding
certainly
too
little
for
the
convenience
of
the
world.
I
cannot
forget
the
follies
and
vices
of
others
so
soon
as
I
ought,
nor
their
offenses
against
myself.
My
feelings
are
not
puffed
about
with
every
attempt
to
move
them.
My
temper
would
perhaps
be
called
resentful.
My
good
opinion
once
lost,
is
lost
forever."
"That
is
a
failing
indeed!"
cried
Elizabeth.
"Implacable
resentment
is
a
shade
in
a
character.
But
you
have
chosen
your
fault
well.
I
really
cannot
laugh
at
it.
You
are
safe
from
me."
"There
is,
I
believe,
in
every
disposition
a
tendency
to
some
particular
evil
a
natural
defect,
which
not
even
the
best
education
can
overcome."
"And
your
defect
is
to
hate
everybody."
"And
yours,"
he
replied
with
a
smile,
"is
willfully
to
misunderstand
them."
"Do
let
us
have
a
little
music,"
cried
Miss
Bingley,
tired
of
a
conversation
in
which
she
had
no
share.
"Louisa,
you
will
not
mind
my
waking
Mr.
Hurst?"
Her
sister
had
not
the
smallest
objection,
and
the
pianoforte
was
opened;
and
Darcy,
after
a
few
moments'
recollection,
was
not
sorry
for
it.
He
began
to
feel
the
danger
of
paying
Elizabeth
too
much
attention.
In
consequence
of
an
agreement
between
the
sisters,
Elizabeth
wrote
the
next
morning
to
their
mother,
to
beg
that
the
carriage
might
be
sent
for
them
in
the
course
of
the
day.
But
Mrs.
Bennet,
who
had
calculated
on
her
daughters
remaining
at
Netherfield
till
the
following
Tuesday,
which
would
exactly
finish
Jane's
week,
could
not
bring
herself
to
receive
them
with
pleasure
before.
Her
answer,
therefore,
was
not
propitious,
at
least
not
to
Elizabeth's
wishes,
for
she
was
impatient
to
get
home.
Mrs.
Bennet
sent
them
word
that
they
could
not
possibly
have
the
carriage
before
Tuesday;
and
in
her
postscript
it
was
added,
that
if
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
sister
pressed
them
to
stay
longer,
she
could
spare
them
very
well.
Against
staying
longer,
however,
Elizabeth
was
positively
resolved
nor
did
she
much
expect
it
would
be
asked;
and
fearful,
on
the
contrary,
as
being
considered
as
intruding
themselves
needlessly
long,
she
urged
Jane
to
borrow
Mr.
Bingley's
carriage
immediately,
and
at
length
it
was
settled
that
their
original
design
of
leaving
Netherfield
that
morning
should
be
mentioned,
and
the
request
made.
The
communication
excited
many
professions
of
concern;
and
enough
was
said
of
wishing
them
to
stay
at
least
till
the
following
day
to
work
on
Jane;
and
till
the
morrow
their
going
was
deferred.
Miss
Bingley
was
then
sorry
that
she
had
proposed
the
delay,
for
her
jealousy
and
dislike
of
one
sister
much
exceeded
her
affection
for
the
other.
The
master
of
the
house
heard
with
real
sorrow
that
they
were
to
go
so
soon,
and
repeatedly
tried
to
persuade
Miss
Bennet
that
it
would
not
be
safe
for
her
that
she
was
not
enough
recovered;
but
Jane
was
firm
