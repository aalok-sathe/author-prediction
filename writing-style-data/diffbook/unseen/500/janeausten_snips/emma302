shall
not
want
opportunities.
And,
in
fact,
you
have
heard
all
the
essential
already.
I
only
wanted
to
prove
to
you
that
Mrs.
S.
admits
our
apology,
and
is
not
offended.
You
see
how
delightfully
she
writes.
Oh!
she
is
a
sweet
creature!
You
would
have
doated
on
her,
had
you
gone.
But
not
a
word
more.
Let
us
be
discreet
quite
on
our
good
behaviour.
Hush!
You
remember
those
lines
I
forget
the
poem
at
this
moment:
"For
when
a
lady's
in
the
case,
"You
know
all
other
things
give
place."
Now
I
say,
my
dear,
in
our
case,
for
lady,
read
mum!
a
word
to
the
wise.
I
am
in
a
fine
flow
of
spirits,
an't
I?
But
I
want
to
set
your
heart
at
ease
as
to
Mrs.
S.
My
representation,
you
see,
has
quite
appeased
her."
And
again,
on
Emma's
merely
turning
her
head
to
look
at
Mrs.
Bates's
knitting,
she
added,
in
a
half
whisper,
"I
mentioned
no
names,
you
will
observe.
Oh!
no;
cautious
as
a
minister
of
state.
I
managed
it
extremely
well."
Emma
could
not
doubt.
It
was
a
palpable
display,
repeated
on
every
possible
occasion.
When
they
had
all
talked
a
little
while
in
harmony
of
the
weather
and
Mrs.
Weston,
she
found
herself
abruptly
addressed
with,
"Do
not
you
think,
Miss
Woodhouse,
our
saucy
little
friend
here
is
charmingly
recovered?
Do
not
you
think
her
cure
does
Perry
the
highest
credit?
(here
was
a
side
glance
of
great
meaning
at
Jane.)
Upon
my
word,
Perry
has
restored
her
in
a
wonderful
short
time!
Oh!
if
you
had
seen
her,
as
I
did,
when
she
was
at
the
worst!"
And
when
Mrs.
Bates
was
saying
something
to
Emma,
whispered
farther,
"We
do
not
say
a
word
of
any
assistance
that
Perry
might
have;
not
a
word
of
a
certain
young
physician
from
Windsor.
Oh!
no;
Perry
shall
have
all
the
credit."
"I
have
scarce
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you,
Miss
Woodhouse,"
she
shortly
afterwards
began,
"since
the
party
to
Box
Hill.
Very
pleasant
party.
But
yet
I
think
there
was
something
wanting.
Things
did
not
seem
that
is,
there
seemed
a
little
cloud
upon
the
spirits
of
some.
So
it
appeared
to
me
at
least,
but
I
might
be
mistaken.
However,
I
think
it
answered
so
far
as
to
tempt
one
to
go
again.
What
say
you
both
to
our
collecting
the
same
party,
and
exploring
to
Box
Hill
again,
while
the
fine
weather
lasts?
It
must
be
the
same
party,
you
know,
quite
the
same
party,
not
one
exception."
Soon
after
this
Miss
Bates
came
in,
and
Emma
could
not
help
being
diverted
by
the
perplexity
of
her
first
answer
to
herself,
resulting,
she
supposed,
from
doubt
of
what
might
be
said,
and
impatience
to
say
every
thing.
"Thank
you,
dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
you
are
all
kindness.
It
is
impossible
to
say
Yes,
indeed,
I
quite
understand
dearest
Jane's
prospects
that
is,
I
do
not
mean.
But
she
is
