Maple
Grove
to
Kings
Weston."
"You
had
better
explore
to
Donwell,"
replied
Mr.
Knightley.
"That
may
be
done
without
horses.
Come,
and
eat
my
strawberries.
They
are
ripening
fast."
If
Mr.
Knightley
did
not
begin
seriously,
he
was
obliged
to
proceed
so,
for
his
proposal
was
caught
at
with
delight;
and
the
"Oh!
I
should
like
it
of
all
things,"
was
not
plainer
in
words
than
manner.
Donwell
was
famous
for
its
strawberry
beds,
which
seemed
a
plea
for
the
invitation:
but
no
plea
was
necessary;
cabbage
beds
would
have
been
enough
to
tempt
the
lady,
who
only
wanted
to
be
going
somewhere.
She
promised
him
again
and
again
to
come
much
oftener
than
he
doubted
and
was
extremely
gratified
by
such
a
proof
of
intimacy,
such
a
distinguishing
compliment
as
she
chose
to
consider
it.
"You
may
depend
upon
me,"
said
she.
"I
certainly
will
come.
Name
your
day,
and
I
will
come.
You
will
allow
me
to
bring
Jane
Fairfax?"
"I
cannot
name
a
day,"
said
he,
"till
I
have
spoken
to
some
others
whom
I
would
wish
to
meet
you."
"Oh!
leave
all
that
to
me.
Only
give
me
a
carte
blanche.
I
am
Lady
Patroness,
you
know.
It
is
my
party.
I
will
bring
friends
with
me."
"I
hope
you
will
bring
Elton,"
said
he:
"but
I
will
not
trouble
you
to
give
any
other
invitations."
"Oh!
now
you
are
looking
very
sly.
But
consider
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
delegating
power
to
me.
I
am
no
young
lady
on
her
preferment.
Married
women,
you
know,
may
be
safely
authorised.
It
is
my
party.
Leave
it
all
to
me.
I
will
invite
your
guests."
"No,"
he
calmly
replied,
"there
is
but
one
married
woman
in
the
world
whom
I
can
ever
allow
to
invite
what
guests
she
pleases
to
Donwell,
and
that
one
is
"
"
Mrs.
Weston,
I
suppose,"
interrupted
Mrs.
Elton,
rather
mortified.
"No
Mrs.
Knightley;
and
till
she
is
in
being,
I
will
manage
such
matters
myself."
"Ah!
you
are
an
odd
creature!"
she
cried,
satisfied
to
have
no
one
preferred
to
herself.
"You
are
a
humourist,
and
may
say
what
you
like.
Quite
a
humourist.
Well,
I
shall
bring
Jane
with
me
Jane
and
her
aunt.
The
rest
I
leave
to
you.
I
have
no
objections
at
all
to
meeting
the
Hartfield
family.
Don't
scruple.
I
know
you
are
attached
to
them."
"You
certainly
will
meet
them
if
I
can
prevail;
and
I
shall
call
on
Miss
Bates
in
my
way
home."
"That's
quite
unnecessary;
I
see
Jane
every
day:
but
as
you
like.
It
is
to
be
a
morning
scheme,
you
know,
Knightley;
quite
a
simple
thing.
I
shall
wear
a
large
bonnet,
and
bring
one
of
my
little
baskets
hanging
on
my
arm.
Here,
probably
this
basket
with
pink
ribbon.
Nothing
can
be
more
simple,
you
see.
And
Jane
will
have
such
another.
There
is
to
be
no
form
or
parade
a
sort
of
gipsy
party.
We
are
to
