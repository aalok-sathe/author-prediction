care
of
them."
Miss
Bates
and
Miss
Fairfax,
escorted
by
the
two
gentlemen,
walked
into
the
room;
and
Mrs.
Elton
seemed
to
think
it
as
much
her
duty
as
Mrs.
Weston's
to
receive
them.
Her
gestures
and
movements
might
be
understood
by
any
one
who
looked
on
like
Emma;
but
her
words,
every
body's
words,
were
soon
lost
under
the
incessant
flow
of
Miss
Bates,
who
came
in
talking,
and
had
not
finished
her
speech
under
many
minutes
after
her
being
admitted
into
the
circle
at
the
fire.
As
the
door
opened
she
was
heard,
"So
very
obliging
of
you!
No
rain
at
all.
Nothing
to
signify.
I
do
not
care
for
myself.
Quite
thick
shoes.
And
Jane
declares
Well!
(as
soon
as
she
was
within
the
door)
Well!
This
is
brilliant
indeed!
This
is
admirable!
Excellently
contrived,
upon
my
word.
Nothing
wanting.
Could
not
have
imagined
it.
So
well
lighted
up!
Jane,
Jane,
look!
did
you
ever
see
any
thing?
Oh!
Mr.
Weston,
you
must
really
have
had
Aladdin's
lamp.
Good
Mrs.
Stokes
would
not
know
her
own
room
again.
I
saw
her
as
I
came
in;
she
was
standing
in
the
entrance.
'Oh!
Mrs.
Stokes,'
said
I
but
I
had
not
time
for
more."
She
was
now
met
by
Mrs.
Weston.
"Very
well,
I
thank
you,
ma'am.
I
hope
you
are
quite
well.
Very
happy
to
hear
it.
So
afraid
you
might
have
a
headache!
seeing
you
pass
by
so
often,
and
knowing
how
much
trouble
you
must
have.
Delighted
to
hear
it
indeed.
Ah!
dear
Mrs.
Elton,
so
obliged
to
you
for
the
carriage!
excellent
time.
Jane
and
I
quite
ready.
Did
not
keep
the
horses
a
moment.
Most
comfortable
carriage.
Oh!
and
I
am
sure
our
thanks
are
due
to
you,
Mrs.
Weston,
on
that
score.
Mrs.
Elton
had
most
kindly
sent
Jane
a
note,
or
we
should
have
been.
But
two
such
offers
in
one
day!
Never
were
such
neighbours.
I
said
to
my
mother,
'Upon
my
word,
ma'am
.'
Thank
you,
my
mother
is
remarkably
well.
Gone
to
Mr.
Woodhouse's.
I
made
her
take
her
shawl
for
the
evenings
are
not
warm
her
large
new
shawl
Mrs.
Dixon's
wedding
present.
So
kind
of
her
to
think
of
my
mother!
Bought
at
Weymouth,
you
know
Mr.
Dixon's
choice.
There
were
three
others,
Jane
says,
which
they
hesitated
about
some
time.
Colonel
Campbell
rather
preferred
an
olive.
My
dear
Jane,
are
you
sure
you
did
not
wet
your
feet?
It
was
but
a
drop
or
two,
but
I
am
so
afraid:
but
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
was
so
extremely
and
there
was
a
mat
to
step
upon
I
shall
never
forget
his
extreme
politeness.
Oh!
Mr.
Frank
Churchill,
I
must
tell
you
my
mother's
spectacles
have
never
been
in
fault
since;
the
rivet
never
came
out
again.
My
mother
often
talks
of
your
good
nature.
Does
not
she,
Jane?
Do
not
we
often
talk
of
Mr.
Frank
Churchill?
Ah!
here's
Miss
Woodhouse.
Dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
how
do
