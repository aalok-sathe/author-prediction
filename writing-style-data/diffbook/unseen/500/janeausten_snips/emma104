sea
at
once,
and
actually
was
all
but
gone,
if
he
had
not,
with
the
greatest
presence
of
mind,
caught
hold
of
her
habit
(I
can
never
think
of
it
without
trembling!)
But
ever
since
we
had
the
history
of
that
day,
I
have
been
so
fond
of
Mr.
Dixon!"
"But,
in
spite
of
all
her
friends'
urgency,
and
her
own
wish
of
seeing
Ireland,
Miss
Fairfax
prefers
devoting
the
time
to
you
and
Mrs.
Bates?"
"Yes
entirely
her
own
doing,
entirely
her
own
choice;
and
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Campbell
think
she
does
quite
right,
just
what
they
should
recommend;
and
indeed
they
particularly
wish
her
to
try
her
native
air,
as
she
has
not
been
quite
so
well
as
usual
lately."
"I
am
concerned
to
hear
of
it.
I
think
they
judge
wisely.
But
Mrs.
Dixon
must
be
very
much
disappointed.
Mrs.
Dixon,
I
understand,
has
no
remarkable
degree
of
personal
beauty;
is
not,
by
any
means,
to
be
compared
with
Miss
Fairfax."
"Oh!
no.
You
are
very
obliging
to
say
such
things
but
certainly
not.
There
is
no
comparison
between
them.
Miss
Campbell
always
was
absolutely
plain
but
extremely
elegant
and
amiable."
"Yes,
that
of
course."
"Jane
caught
a
bad
cold,
poor
thing!
so
long
ago
as
the
7th
of
November,
(as
I
am
going
to
read
to
you,)
and
has
never
been
well
since.
A
long
time,
is
not
it,
for
a
cold
to
hang
upon
her?
She
never
mentioned
it
before,
because
she
would
not
alarm
us.
Just
like
her!
so
considerate!
But
however,
she
is
so
far
from
well,
that
her
kind
friends
the
Campbells
think
she
had
better
come
home,
and
try
an
air
that
always
agrees
with
her;
and
they
have
no
doubt
that
three
or
four
months
at
Highbury
will
entirely
cure
her
and
it
is
certainly
a
great
deal
better
that
she
should
come
here,
than
go
to
Ireland,
if
she
is
unwell.
Nobody
could
nurse
her,
as
we
should
do."
"It
appears
to
me
the
most
desirable
arrangement
in
the
world."
"And
so
she
is
to
come
to
us
next
Friday
or
Saturday,
and
the
Campbells
leave
town
in
their
way
to
Holyhead
the
Monday
following
as
you
will
find
from
Jane's
letter.
So
sudden!
You
may
guess,
dear
Miss
Woodhouse,
what
a
flurry
it
has
thrown
me
in!
If
it
was
not
for
the
drawback
of
her
illness
but
I
am
afraid
we
must
expect
to
see
her
grown
thin,
and
looking
very
poorly.
I
must
tell
you
what
an
unlucky
thing
happened
to
me,
as
to
that.
I
always
make
a
point
of
reading
Jane's
letters
through
to
myself
first,
before
I
read
them
aloud
to
my
mother,
you
know,
for
fear
of
there
being
any
thing
in
them
to
distress
her.
Jane
desired
me
to
do
it,
so
I
always
do:
and
so
I
began
to
day
with
my
usual
caution;
but
no
sooner
did
I
come
to
the
mention
of
her
being
unwell,
than
I
burst
