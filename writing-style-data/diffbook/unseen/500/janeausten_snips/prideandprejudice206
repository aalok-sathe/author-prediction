to
Newcastle.
And
you
saw
the
old
housekeeper,
I
suppose?
Poor
Reynolds,
she
was
always
very
fond
of
me.
But
of
course
she
did
not
mention
my
name
to
you."
"Yes,
she
did."
"And
what
did
she
say?"
"That
you
were
gone
into
the
army,
and
she
was
afraid
had
not
turned
out
well.
At
such
a
distance
as
that,
you
know,
things
are
strangely
misrepresented."
"Certainly,"
he
replied,
biting
his
lips.
Elizabeth
hoped
she
had
silenced
him;
but
he
soon
afterwards
said:
"I
was
surprised
to
see
Darcy
in
town
last
month.
We
passed
each
other
several
times.
I
wonder
what
he
can
be
doing
there."
"Perhaps
preparing
for
his
marriage
with
Miss
de
Bourgh,"
said
Elizabeth.
"It
must
be
something
particular,
to
take
him
there
at
this
time
of
year."
"Undoubtedly.
Did
you
see
him
while
you
were
at
Lambton?
I
thought
I
understood
from
the
Gardiners
that
you
had."
"Yes;
he
introduced
us
to
his
sister."
"And
do
you
like
her?"
"Very
much."
"I
have
heard,
indeed,
that
she
is
uncommonly
improved
within
this
year
or
two.
When
I
last
saw
her,
she
was
not
very
promising.
I
am
very
glad
you
liked
her.
I
hope
she
will
turn
out
well."
"I
dare
say
she
will;
she
has
got
over
the
most
trying
age."
"Did
you
go
by
the
village
of
Kympton?"
"I
do
not
recollect
that
we
did."
"I
mention
it,
because
it
is
the
living
which
I
ought
to
have
had.
A
most
delightful
place!
Excellent
Parsonage
House!
It
would
have
suited
me
in
every
respect."
"How
should
you
have
liked
making
sermons?"
"Exceedingly
well.
I
should
have
considered
it
as
part
of
my
duty,
and
the
exertion
would
soon
have
been
nothing.
One
ought
not
to
repine;
but,
to
be
sure,
it
would
have
been
such
a
thing
for
me!
The
quiet,
the
retirement
of
such
a
life
would
have
answered
all
my
ideas
of
happiness!
But
it
was
not
to
be.
Did
you
ever
hear
Darcy
mention
the
circumstance,
when
you
were
in
Kent?"
"I
have
heard
from
authority,
which
I
thought
as
good,
that
it
was
left
you
conditionally
only,
and
at
the
will
of
the
present
patron."
"You
have.
Yes,
there
was
something
in
that;
I
told
you
so
from
the
first,
you
may
remember."
"I
did
hear,
too,
that
there
was
a
time,
when
sermon
making
was
not
so
palatable
to
you
as
it
seems
to
be
at
present;
that
you
actually
declared
your
resolution
of
never
taking
orders,
and
that
the
business
had
been
compromised
accordingly."
"You
did!
and
it
was
not
wholly
without
foundation.
You
may
remember
what
I
told
you
on
that
point,
when
first
we
talked
of
it."
They
were
now
almost
at
the
door
of
the
house,
for
she
had
walked
fast
to
get
rid
of
him;
and
unwilling,
for
her
sister's
sake,
to
provoke
him,
she
only
said
in
reply,
with
a
good
humoured
smile:
"Come,
Mr.
Wickham,
we
are
brother
and
sister,
you
