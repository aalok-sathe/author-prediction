as
an
offering
of
love."
There
was
no
occasion
to
press
the
matter
farther.
The
conviction
seemed
real;
he
looked
as
if
he
felt
it.
She
said
no
more,
other
subjects
took
their
turn;
and
the
rest
of
the
dinner
passed
away;
the
dessert
succeeded,
the
children
came
in,
and
were
talked
to
and
admired
amid
the
usual
rate
of
conversation;
a
few
clever
things
said,
a
few
downright
silly,
but
by
much
the
larger
proportion
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
nothing
worse
than
everyday
remarks,
dull
repetitions,
old
news,
and
heavy
jokes.
The
ladies
had
not
been
long
in
the
drawing
room,
before
the
other
ladies,
in
their
different
divisions,
arrived.
Emma
watched
the
entree
of
her
own
particular
little
friend;
and
if
she
could
not
exult
in
her
dignity
and
grace,
she
could
not
only
love
the
blooming
sweetness
and
the
artless
manner,
but
could
most
heartily
rejoice
in
that
light,
cheerful,
unsentimental
disposition
which
allowed
her
so
many
alleviations
of
pleasure,
in
the
midst
of
the
pangs
of
disappointed
affection.
There
she
sat
and
who
would
have
guessed
how
many
tears
she
had
been
lately
shedding?
To
be
in
company,
nicely
dressed
herself
and
seeing
others
nicely
dressed,
to
sit
and
smile
and
look
pretty,
and
say
nothing,
was
enough
for
the
happiness
of
the
present
hour.
Jane
Fairfax
did
look
and
move
superior;
but
Emma
suspected
she
might
have
been
glad
to
change
feelings
with
Harriet,
very
glad
to
have
purchased
the
mortification
of
having
loved
yes,
of
having
loved
even
Mr.
Elton
in
vain
by
the
surrender
of
all
the
dangerous
pleasure
of
knowing
herself
beloved
by
the
husband
of
her
friend.
In
so
large
a
party
it
was
not
necessary
that
Emma
should
approach
her.
She
did
not
wish
to
speak
of
the
pianoforte,
she
felt
too
much
in
the
secret
herself,
to
think
the
appearance
of
curiosity
or
interest
fair,
and
therefore
purposely
kept
at
a
distance;
but
by
the
others,
the
subject
was
almost
immediately
introduced,
and
she
saw
the
blush
of
consciousness
with
which
congratulations
were
received,
the
blush
of
guilt
which
accompanied
the
name
of
"my
excellent
friend
Colonel
Campbell."
Mrs.
Weston,
kind
hearted
and
musical,
was
particularly
interested
by
the
circumstance,
and
Emma
could
not
help
being
amused
at
her
perseverance
in
dwelling
on
the
subject;
and
having
so
much
to
ask
and
to
say
as
to
tone,
touch,
and
pedal,
totally
unsuspicious
of
that
wish
of
saying
as
little
about
it
as
possible,
which
she
plainly
read
in
the
fair
heroine's
countenance.
They
were
soon
joined
by
some
of
the
gentlemen;
and
the
very
first
of
the
early
was
Frank
Churchill.
In
he
walked,
the
first
and
the
handsomest;
and
after
paying
his
compliments
en
passant
to
Miss
Bates
and
her
niece,
made
his
way
directly
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
circle,
where
sat
Miss
Woodhouse;
and
till
he
could
find
a
seat
by
her,
would
not
sit
at
all.
Emma
divined
what
every
body
present
