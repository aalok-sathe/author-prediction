disappointed;
and
at
last
I
was
not
disappointed
either
in
the
object
of
my
journey.
A
great
deal
of
very
reasonable,
very
just
displeasure
I
had
to
persuade
away.
But
it
is
done;
we
are
reconciled,
dearer,
much
dearer,
than
ever,
and
no
moment's
uneasiness
can
ever
occur
between
us
again.
Now,
my
dear
madam,
I
will
release
you;
but
I
could
not
conclude
before.
A
thousand
and
a
thousand
thanks
for
all
the
kindness
you
have
ever
shewn
me,
and
ten
thousand
for
the
attentions
your
heart
will
dictate
towards
her.
If
you
think
me
in
a
way
to
be
happier
than
I
deserve,
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion.
Miss
W.
calls
me
the
child
of
good
fortune.
I
hope
she
is
right.
In
one
respect,
my
good
fortune
is
undoubted,
that
of
being
able
to
subscribe
myself,
Your
obliged
and
affectionate
Son,
F.
C.
WESTON
CHURCHILL.
This
letter
must
make
its
way
to
Emma's
feelings.
She
was
obliged,
in
spite
of
her
previous
determination
to
the
contrary,
to
do
it
all
the
justice
that
Mrs.
Weston
foretold.
As
soon
as
she
came
to
her
own
name,
it
was
irresistible;
every
line
relating
to
herself
was
interesting,
and
almost
every
line
agreeable;
and
when
this
charm
ceased,
the
subject
could
still
maintain
itself,
by
the
natural
return
of
her
former
regard
for
the
writer,
and
the
very
strong
attraction
which
any
picture
of
love
must
have
for
her
at
that
moment.
She
never
stopt
till
she
had
gone
through
the
whole;
and
though
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
that
he
had
been
wrong,
yet
he
had
been
less
wrong
than
she
had
supposed
and
he
had
suffered,
and
was
very
sorry
and
he
was
so
grateful
to
Mrs.
Weston,
and
so
much
in
love
with
Miss
Fairfax,
and
she
was
so
happy
herself,
that
there
was
no
being
severe;
and
could
he
have
entered
the
room,
she
must
have
shaken
hands
with
him
as
heartily
as
ever.
She
thought
so
well
of
the
letter,
that
when
Mr.
Knightley
came
again,
she
desired
him
to
read
it.
She
was
sure
of
Mrs.
Weston's
wishing
it
to
be
communicated;
especially
to
one,
who,
like
Mr.
Knightley,
had
seen
so
much
to
blame
in
his
conduct.
"I
shall
be
very
glad
to
look
it
over,"
said
he;
"but
it
seems
long.
I
will
take
it
home
with
me
at
night."
But
that
would
not
do.
Mr.
Weston
was
to
call
in
the
evening,
and
she
must
return
it
by
him.
"I
would
rather
be
talking
to
you,"
he
replied;
"but
as
it
seems
a
matter
of
justice,
it
shall
be
done."
He
began
stopping,
however,
almost
directly
to
say,
"Had
I
been
offered
the
sight
of
one
of
this
gentleman's
letters
to
his
mother
in
law
a
few
months
ago,
Emma,
it
would
not
have
been
taken
with
such
indifference."
He
proceeded
a
little
farther,
reading
to
himself;
and
then,
with
a
smile,
observed,
"Humph!
a
fine
complimentary
opening:
But
