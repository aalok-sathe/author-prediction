those
who
might
hate
her
into
outward
respect.
She
had
never
boasted
either
beauty
or
cleverness.
Her
youth
had
passed
without
distinction,
and
her
middle
of
life
was
devoted
to
the
care
of
a
failing
mother,
and
the
endeavour
to
make
a
small
income
go
as
far
as
possible.
And
yet
she
was
a
happy
woman,
and
a
woman
whom
no
one
named
without
good
will.
It
was
her
own
universal
good
will
and
contented
temper
which
worked
such
wonders.
She
loved
every
body,
was
interested
in
every
body's
happiness,
quicksighted
to
every
body's
merits;
thought
herself
a
most
fortunate
creature,
and
surrounded
with
blessings
in
such
an
excellent
mother,
and
so
many
good
neighbours
and
friends,
and
a
home
that
wanted
for
nothing.
The
simplicity
and
cheerfulness
of
her
nature,
her
contented
and
grateful
spirit,
were
a
recommendation
to
every
body,
and
a
mine
of
felicity
to
herself.
She
was
a
great
talker
upon
little
matters,
which
exactly
suited
Mr.
Woodhouse,
full
of
trivial
communications
and
harmless
gossip.
Mrs.
Goddard
was
the
mistress
of
a
School
not
of
a
seminary,
or
an
establishment,
or
any
thing
which
professed,
in
long
sentences
of
refined
nonsense,
to
combine
liberal
acquirements
with
elegant
morality,
upon
new
principles
and
new
systems
and
where
young
ladies
for
enormous
pay
might
be
screwed
out
of
health
and
into
vanity
but
a
real,
honest,
old
fashioned
Boarding
school,
where
a
reasonable
quantity
of
accomplishments
were
sold
at
a
reasonable
price,
and
where
girls
might
be
sent
to
be
out
of
the
way,
and
scramble
themselves
into
a
little
education,
without
any
danger
of
coming
back
prodigies.
Mrs.
Goddard's
school
was
in
high
repute
and
very
deservedly;
for
Highbury
was
reckoned
a
particularly
healthy
spot:
she
had
an
ample
house
and
garden,
gave
the
children
plenty
of
wholesome
food,
let
them
run
about
a
great
deal
in
the
summer,
and
in
winter
dressed
their
chilblains
with
her
own
hands.
It
was
no
wonder
that
a
train
of
twenty
young
couple
now
walked
after
her
to
church.
She
was
a
plain,
motherly
kind
of
woman,
who
had
worked
hard
in
her
youth,
and
now
thought
herself
entitled
to
the
occasional
holiday
of
a
tea
visit;
and
having
formerly
owed
much
to
Mr.
Woodhouse's
kindness,
felt
his
particular
claim
on
her
to
leave
her
neat
parlour,
hung
round
with
fancy
work,
whenever
she
could,
and
win
or
lose
a
few
sixpences
by
his
fireside.
These
were
the
ladies
whom
Emma
found
herself
very
frequently
able
to
collect;
and
happy
was
she,
for
her
father's
sake,
in
the
power;
though,
as
far
as
she
was
herself
concerned,
it
was
no
remedy
for
the
absence
of
Mrs.
Weston.
She
was
delighted
to
see
her
father
look
comfortable,
and
very
much
pleased
with
herself
for
contriving
things
so
well;
but
the
quiet
prosings
of
three
such
women
made
her
feel
that
every
evening
so
spent
was
indeed
one
of
the
long
evenings
she
had
fearfully
anticipated.
As
she
sat
one
morning,
looking
