to
Box
Hill.
That
there
was
to
be
such
a
party
had
been
long
generally
known:
it
had
even
given
the
idea
of
another.
Emma
had
never
been
to
Box
Hill;
she
wished
to
see
what
every
body
found
so
well
worth
seeing,
and
she
and
Mr.
Weston
had
agreed
to
chuse
some
fine
morning
and
drive
thither.
Two
or
three
more
of
the
chosen
only
were
to
be
admitted
to
join
them,
and
it
was
to
be
done
in
a
quiet,
unpretending,
elegant
way,
infinitely
superior
to
the
bustle
and
preparation,
the
regular
eating
and
drinking,
and
picnic
parade
of
the
Eltons
and
the
Sucklings.
This
was
so
very
well
understood
between
them,
that
Emma
could
not
but
feel
some
surprise,
and
a
little
displeasure,
on
hearing
from
Mr.
Weston
that
he
had
been
proposing
to
Mrs.
Elton,
as
her
brother
and
sister
had
failed
her,
that
the
two
parties
should
unite,
and
go
together;
and
that
as
Mrs.
Elton
had
very
readily
acceded
to
it,
so
it
was
to
be,
if
she
had
no
objection.
Now,
as
her
objection
was
nothing
but
her
very
great
dislike
of
Mrs.
Elton,
of
which
Mr.
Weston
must
already
be
perfectly
aware,
it
was
not
worth
bringing
forward
again:
it
could
not
be
done
without
a
reproof
to
him,
which
would
be
giving
pain
to
his
wife;
and
she
found
herself
therefore
obliged
to
consent
to
an
arrangement
which
she
would
have
done
a
great
deal
to
avoid;
an
arrangement
which
would
probably
expose
her
even
to
the
degradation
of
being
said
to
be
of
Mrs.
Elton's
party!
Every
feeling
was
offended;
and
the
forbearance
of
her
outward
submission
left
a
heavy
arrear
due
of
secret
severity
in
her
reflections
on
the
unmanageable
goodwill
of
Mr.
Weston's
temper.
"I
am
glad
you
approve
of
what
I
have
done,"
said
he
very
comfortably.
"But
I
thought
you
would.
Such
schemes
as
these
are
nothing
without
numbers.
One
cannot
have
too
large
a
party.
A
large
party
secures
its
own
amusement.
And
she
is
a
good
natured
woman
after
all.
One
could
not
leave
her
out."
Emma
denied
none
of
it
aloud,
and
agreed
to
none
of
it
in
private.
It
was
now
the
middle
of
June,
and
the
weather
fine;
and
Mrs.
Elton
was
growing
impatient
to
name
the
day,
and
settle
with
Mr.
Weston
as
to
pigeon
pies
and
cold
lamb,
when
a
lame
carriage
horse
threw
every
thing
into
sad
uncertainty.
It
might
be
weeks,
it
might
be
only
a
few
days,
before
the
horse
were
useable;
but
no
preparations
could
be
ventured
on,
and
it
was
all
melancholy
stagnation.
Mrs.
Elton's
resources
were
inadequate
to
such
an
attack.
"Is
not
this
most
vexatious,
Knightley?"
she
cried.
"And
such
weather
for
exploring!
These
delays
and
disappointments
are
quite
odious.
What
are
we
to
do?
The
year
will
wear
away
at
this
rate,
and
nothing
done.
Before
this
time
last
year
I
assure
you
we
had
had
a
delightful
exploring
party
from
