as
much
as
you
choose,
but
you
will
not
laugh
me
out
of
my
opinion.
My
dearest
Lizzy,
do
but
consider
in
what
a
disgraceful
light
it
places
Mr.
Darcy,
to
be
treating
his
father's
favourite
in
such
a
manner,
one
whom
his
father
had
promised
to
provide
for.
It
is
impossible.
No
man
of
common
humanity,
no
man
who
had
any
value
for
his
character,
could
be
capable
of
it.
Can
his
most
intimate
friends
be
so
excessively
deceived
in
him?
Oh!
no."
"I
can
much
more
easily
believe
Mr.
Bingley's
being
imposed
on,
than
that
Mr.
Wickham
should
invent
such
a
history
of
himself
as
he
gave
me
last
night;
names,
facts,
everything
mentioned
without
ceremony.
If
it
be
not
so,
let
Mr.
Darcy
contradict
it.
Besides,
there
was
truth
in
his
looks."
"It
is
difficult
indeed
it
is
distressing.
One
does
not
know
what
to
think."
"I
beg
your
pardon;
one
knows
exactly
what
to
think."
But
Jane
could
think
with
certainty
on
only
one
point
that
Mr.
Bingley,
if
he
had
been
imposed
on,
would
have
much
to
suffer
when
the
affair
became
public.
The
two
young
ladies
were
summoned
from
the
shrubbery,
where
this
conversation
passed,
by
the
arrival
of
the
very
persons
of
whom
they
had
been
speaking;
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
sisters
came
to
give
their
personal
invitation
for
the
long
expected
ball
at
Netherfield,
which
was
fixed
for
the
following
Tuesday.
The
two
ladies
were
delighted
to
see
their
dear
friend
again,
called
it
an
age
since
they
had
met,
and
repeatedly
asked
what
she
had
been
doing
with
herself
since
their
separation.
To
the
rest
of
the
family
they
paid
little
attention;
avoiding
Mrs.
Bennet
as
much
as
possible,
saying
not
much
to
Elizabeth,
and
nothing
at
all
to
the
others.
They
were
soon
gone
again,
rising
from
their
seats
with
an
activity
which
took
their
brother
by
surprise,
and
hurrying
off
as
if
eager
to
escape
from
Mrs.
Bennet's
civilities.
The
prospect
of
the
Netherfield
ball
was
extremely
agreeable
to
every
female
of
the
family.
Mrs.
Bennet
chose
to
consider
it
as
given
in
compliment
to
her
eldest
daughter,
and
was
particularly
flattered
by
receiving
the
invitation
from
Mr.
Bingley
himself,
instead
of
a
ceremonious
card.
Jane
pictured
to
herself
a
happy
evening
in
the
society
of
her
two
friends,
and
the
attentions
of
their
brother;
and
Elizabeth
thought
with
pleasure
of
dancing
a
great
deal
with
Mr.
Wickham,
and
of
seeing
a
confirmation
of
everything
in
Mr.
Darcy's
look
and
behaviour.
The
happiness
anticipated
by
Catherine
and
Lydia
depended
less
on
any
single
event,
or
any
particular
person,
for
though
they
each,
like
Elizabeth,
meant
to
dance
half
the
evening
with
Mr.
Wickham,
he
was
by
no
means
the
only
partner
who
could
satisfy
them,
and
a
ball
was,
at
any
rate,
a
ball.
And
even
Mary
could
assure
her
family
that
she
had
no
disinclination
for
it.
"While
I
can
have
my
mornings
to
myself,"
said
she,
"it
