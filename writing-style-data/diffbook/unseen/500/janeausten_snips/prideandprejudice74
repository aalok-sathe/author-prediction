be
supposed
that
their
absence
from
Netherfield
would
prevent
Mr.
Bingley's
being
there;
and
as
to
the
loss
of
their
society,
she
was
persuaded
that
Jane
must
cease
to
regard
it,
in
the
enjoyment
of
his.
"It
is
unlucky,"
said
she,
after
a
short
pause,
"that
you
should
not
be
able
to
see
your
friends
before
they
leave
the
country.
But
may
we
not
hope
that
the
period
of
future
happiness
to
which
Miss
Bingley
looks
forward
may
arrive
earlier
than
she
is
aware,
and
that
the
delightful
intercourse
you
have
known
as
friends
will
be
renewed
with
yet
greater
satisfaction
as
sisters?
Mr.
Bingley
will
not
be
detained
in
London
by
them."
"Caroline
decidedly
says
that
none
of
the
party
will
return
into
Hertfordshire
this
winter.
I
will
read
it
to
you:"
"When
my
brother
left
us
yesterday,
he
imagined
that
the
business
which
took
him
to
London
might
be
concluded
in
three
or
four
days;
but
as
we
are
certain
it
cannot
be
so,
and
at
the
same
time
convinced
that
when
Charles
gets
to
town
he
will
be
in
no
hurry
to
leave
it
again,
we
have
determined
on
following
him
thither,
that
he
may
not
be
obliged
to
spend
his
vacant
hours
in
a
comfortless
hotel.
Many
of
my
acquaintances
are
already
there
for
the
winter;
I
wish
that
I
could
hear
that
you,
my
dearest
friend,
had
any
intention
of
making
one
of
the
crowd
but
of
that
I
despair.
I
sincerely
hope
your
Christmas
in
Hertfordshire
may
abound
in
the
gaieties
which
that
season
generally
brings,
and
that
your
beaux
will
be
so
numerous
as
to
prevent
your
feeling
the
loss
of
the
three
of
whom
we
shall
deprive
you."
"It
is
evident
by
this,"
added
Jane,
"that
he
comes
back
no
more
this
winter."
"It
is
only
evident
that
Miss
Bingley
does
not
mean
that
he
should."
"Why
will
you
think
so?
It
must
be
his
own
doing.
He
is
his
own
master.
But
you
do
not
know
all.
I
will
read
you
the
passage
which
particularly
hurts
me.
I
will
have
no
reserves
from
you."
"Mr.
Darcy
is
impatient
to
see
his
sister;
and,
to
confess
the
truth,
we
are
scarcely
less
eager
to
meet
her
again.
I
really
do
not
think
Georgiana
Darcy
has
her
equal
for
beauty,
elegance,
and
accomplishments;
and
the
affection
she
inspires
in
Louisa
and
myself
is
heightened
into
something
still
more
interesting,
from
the
hope
we
dare
entertain
of
her
being
hereafter
our
sister.
I
do
not
know
whether
I
ever
before
mentioned
to
you
my
feelings
on
this
subject;
but
I
will
not
leave
the
country
without
confiding
them,
and
I
trust
you
will
not
esteem
them
unreasonable.
My
brother
admires
her
greatly
already;
he
will
have
frequent
opportunity
now
of
seeing
her
on
the
most
intimate
footing;
her
relations
all
wish
the
connection
as
much
as
his
own;
and
a
sister's
partiality
is
not
misleading
me,
I
think,
when
I
call
Charles
most
capable
