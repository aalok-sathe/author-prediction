told
the
girls
what
an
honour
they
might
expect,
adding:
"I
may
thank
you,
Eliza,
for
this
piece
of
civility.
Mr.
Darcy
would
never
have
come
so
soon
to
wait
upon
me."
Elizabeth
had
scarcely
time
to
disclaim
all
right
to
the
compliment,
before
their
approach
was
announced
by
the
door
bell,
and
shortly
afterwards
the
three
gentlemen
entered
the
room.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam,
who
led
the
way,
was
about
thirty,
not
handsome,
but
in
person
and
address
most
truly
the
gentleman.
Mr.
Darcy
looked
just
as
he
had
been
used
to
look
in
Hertfordshire
paid
his
compliments,
with
his
usual
reserve,
to
Mrs.
Collins,
and
whatever
might
be
his
feelings
toward
her
friend,
met
her
with
every
appearance
of
composure.
Elizabeth
merely
curtseyed
to
him
without
saying
a
word.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
entered
into
conversation
directly
with
the
readiness
and
ease
of
a
well
bred
man,
and
talked
very
pleasantly;
but
his
cousin,
after
having
addressed
a
slight
observation
on
the
house
and
garden
to
Mrs.
Collins,
sat
for
some
time
without
speaking
to
anybody.
At
length,
however,
his
civility
was
so
far
awakened
as
to
inquire
of
Elizabeth
after
the
health
of
her
family.
She
answered
him
in
the
usual
way,
and
after
a
moment's
pause,
added:
"My
eldest
sister
has
been
in
town
these
three
months.
Have
you
never
happened
to
see
her
there?"
She
was
perfectly
sensible
that
he
never
had;
but
she
wished
to
see
whether
he
would
betray
any
consciousness
of
what
had
passed
between
the
Bingleys
and
Jane,
and
she
thought
he
looked
a
little
confused
as
he
answered
that
he
had
never
been
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
Miss
Bennet.
The
subject
was
pursued
no
farther,
and
the
gentlemen
soon
afterwards
went
away.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam's
manners
were
very
much
admired
at
the
Parsonage,
and
the
ladies
all
felt
that
he
must
add
considerably
to
the
pleasures
of
their
engagements
at
Rosings.
It
was
some
days,
however,
before
they
received
any
invitation
thither
for
while
there
were
visitors
in
the
house,
they
could
not
be
necessary;
and
it
was
not
till
Easter
day,
almost
a
week
after
the
gentlemen's
arrival,
that
they
were
honoured
by
such
an
attention,
and
then
they
were
merely
asked
on
leaving
church
to
come
there
in
the
evening.
For
the
last
week
they
had
seen
very
little
of
Lady
Catherine
or
her
daughter.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
had
called
at
the
Parsonage
more
than
once
during
the
time,
but
Mr.
Darcy
they
had
seen
only
at
church.
The
invitation
was
accepted
of
course,
and
at
a
proper
hour
they
joined
the
party
in
Lady
Catherine's
drawing
room.
Her
ladyship
received
them
civilly,
but
it
was
plain
that
their
company
was
by
no
means
so
acceptable
as
when
she
could
get
nobody
else;
and
she
was,
in
fact,
almost
engrossed
by
her
nephews,
speaking
to
them,
especially
to
Darcy,
much
more
than
to
any
other
person
in
the
room.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
seemed
really
glad
to
see
them;
anything
was
a
welcome
relief
to
