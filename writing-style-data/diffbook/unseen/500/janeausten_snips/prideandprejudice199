to
avoid
a
family
circle
was
even
more
desirable
to
such
as
did
think,
than
such
as
did
not.
Wickham's
affection
for
Lydia
was
just
what
Elizabeth
had
expected
to
find
it;
not
equal
to
Lydia's
for
him.
She
had
scarcely
needed
her
present
observation
to
be
satisfied,
from
the
reason
of
things,
that
their
elopement
had
been
brought
on
by
the
strength
of
her
love,
rather
than
by
his;
and
she
would
have
wondered
why,
without
violently
caring
for
her,
he
chose
to
elope
with
her
at
all,
had
she
not
felt
certain
that
his
flight
was
rendered
necessary
by
distress
of
circumstances;
and
if
that
were
the
case,
he
was
not
the
young
man
to
resist
an
opportunity
of
having
a
companion.
Lydia
was
exceedingly
fond
of
him.
He
was
her
dear
Wickham
on
every
occasion;
no
one
was
to
be
put
in
competition
with
him.
He
did
every
thing
best
in
the
world;
and
she
was
sure
he
would
kill
more
birds
on
the
first
of
September,
than
any
body
else
in
the
country.
One
morning,
soon
after
their
arrival,
as
she
was
sitting
with
her
two
elder
sisters,
she
said
to
Elizabeth:
"Lizzy,
I
never
gave
you
an
account
of
my
wedding,
I
believe.
You
were
not
by,
when
I
told
mamma
and
the
others
all
about
it.
Are
not
you
curious
to
hear
how
it
was
managed?"
"No
really,"
replied
Elizabeth;
"I
think
there
cannot
be
too
little
said
on
the
subject."
"La!
You
are
so
strange!
But
I
must
tell
you
how
it
went
off.
We
were
married,
you
know,
at
St.
Clement's,
because
Wickham's
lodgings
were
in
that
parish.
And
it
was
settled
that
we
should
all
be
there
by
eleven
o'clock.
My
uncle
and
aunt
and
I
were
to
go
together;
and
the
others
were
to
meet
us
at
the
church.
Well,
Monday
morning
came,
and
I
was
in
such
a
fuss!
I
was
so
afraid,
you
know,
that
something
would
happen
to
put
it
off,
and
then
I
should
have
gone
quite
distracted.
And
there
was
my
aunt,
all
the
time
I
was
dressing,
preaching
and
talking
away
just
as
if
she
was
reading
a
sermon.
However,
I
did
not
hear
above
one
word
in
ten,
for
I
was
thinking,
you
may
suppose,
of
my
dear
Wickham.
I
longed
to
know
whether
he
would
be
married
in
his
blue
coat."
"Well,
and
so
we
breakfasted
at
ten
as
usual;
I
thought
it
would
never
be
over;
for,
by
the
bye,
you
are
to
understand,
that
my
uncle
and
aunt
were
horrid
unpleasant
all
the
time
I
was
with
them.
If
you'll
believe
me,
I
did
not
once
put
my
foot
out
of
doors,
though
I
was
there
a
fortnight.
Not
one
party,
or
scheme,
or
anything.
To
be
sure
London
was
rather
thin,
but,
however,
the
Little
Theatre
was
open.
Well,
and
so
just
as
the
carriage
came
to
the
door,
my
uncle
was
called
away
upon
business
to
that
horrid
