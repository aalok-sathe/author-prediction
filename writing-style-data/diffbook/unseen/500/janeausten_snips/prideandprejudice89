is
very
improbable
that
they
should
meet
at
all,
unless
he
really
comes
to
see
her."
"And
that
is
quite
impossible;
for
he
is
now
in
the
custody
of
his
friend,
and
Mr.
Darcy
would
no
more
suffer
him
to
call
on
Jane
in
such
a
part
of
London!
My
dear
aunt,
how
could
you
think
of
it?
Mr.
Darcy
may
perhaps
have
heard
of
such
a
place
as
Gracechurch
Street,
but
he
would
hardly
think
a
month's
ablution
enough
to
cleanse
him
from
its
impurities,
were
he
once
to
enter
it;
and
depend
upon
it,
Mr.
Bingley
never
stirs
without
him."
"So
much
the
better.
I
hope
they
will
not
meet
at
all.
But
does
not
Jane
correspond
with
his
sister?
She
will
not
be
able
to
help
calling."
"She
will
drop
the
acquaintance
entirely."
But
in
spite
of
the
certainty
in
which
Elizabeth
affected
to
place
this
point,
as
well
as
the
still
more
interesting
one
of
Bingley's
being
withheld
from
seeing
Jane,
she
felt
a
solicitude
on
the
subject
which
convinced
her,
on
examination,
that
she
did
not
consider
it
entirely
hopeless.
It
was
possible,
and
sometimes
she
thought
it
probable,
that
his
affection
might
be
reanimated,
and
the
influence
of
his
friends
successfully
combated
by
the
more
natural
influence
of
Jane's
attractions.
Miss
Bennet
accepted
her
aunt's
invitation
with
pleasure;
and
the
Bingleys
were
no
otherwise
in
her
thoughts
at
the
same
time,
than
as
she
hoped
by
Caroline's
not
living
in
the
same
house
with
her
brother,
she
might
occasionally
spend
a
morning
with
her,
without
any
danger
of
seeing
him.
The
Gardiners
stayed
a
week
at
Longbourn;
and
what
with
the
Phillipses,
the
Lucases,
and
the
officers,
there
was
not
a
day
without
its
engagement.
Mrs.
Bennet
had
so
carefully
provided
for
the
entertainment
of
her
brother
and
sister,
that
they
did
not
once
sit
down
to
a
family
dinner.
When
the
engagement
was
for
home,
some
of
the
officers
always
made
part
of
it
of
which
officers
Mr.
Wickham
was
sure
to
be
one;
and
on
these
occasions,
Mrs.
Gardiner,
rendered
suspicious
by
Elizabeth's
warm
commendation,
narrowly
observed
them
both.
Without
supposing
them,
from
what
she
saw,
to
be
very
seriously
in
love,
their
preference
of
each
other
was
plain
enough
to
make
her
a
little
uneasy;
and
she
resolved
to
speak
to
Elizabeth
on
the
subject
before
she
left
Hertfordshire,
and
represent
to
her
the
imprudence
of
encouraging
such
an
attachment.
To
Mrs.
Gardiner,
Wickham
had
one
means
of
affording
pleasure,
unconnected
with
his
general
powers.
About
ten
or
a
dozen
years
ago,
before
her
marriage,
she
had
spent
a
considerable
time
in
that
very
part
of
Derbyshire
to
which
he
belonged.
They
had,
therefore,
many
acquaintances
in
common;
and
though
Wickham
had
been
little
there
since
the
death
of
Darcy's
father,
it
was
yet
in
his
power
to
give
her
fresher
intelligence
of
her
former
friends
than
she
had
been
in
the
way
of
procuring.
Mrs.
Gardiner
had
seen
Pemberley,
and
