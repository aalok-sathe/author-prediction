for
some
parts
of
my
past
conduct.
But
I
have
been
forgiven
by
one
who
had
still
more
to
resent.
My
courage
rises
while
I
write.
It
is
very
difficult
for
the
prosperous
to
be
humble.
I
have
already
met
with
such
success
in
two
applications
for
pardon,
that
I
may
be
in
danger
of
thinking
myself
too
sure
of
yours,
and
of
those
among
your
friends
who
have
had
any
ground
of
offence.
You
must
all
endeavour
to
comprehend
the
exact
nature
of
my
situation
when
I
first
arrived
at
Randalls;
you
must
consider
me
as
having
a
secret
which
was
to
be
kept
at
all
hazards.
This
was
the
fact.
My
right
to
place
myself
in
a
situation
requiring
such
concealment,
is
another
question.
I
shall
not
discuss
it
here.
For
my
temptation
to
think
it
a
right,
I
refer
every
caviller
to
a
brick
house,
sashed
windows
below,
and
casements
above,
in
Highbury.
I
dared
not
address
her
openly;
my
difficulties
in
the
then
state
of
Enscombe
must
be
too
well
known
to
require
definition;
and
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
prevail,
before
we
parted
at
Weymouth,
and
to
induce
the
most
upright
female
mind
in
the
creation
to
stoop
in
charity
to
a
secret
engagement.
Had
she
refused,
I
should
have
gone
mad.
But
you
will
be
ready
to
say,
what
was
your
hope
in
doing
this?
What
did
you
look
forward
to?
To
any
thing,
every
thing
to
time,
chance,
circumstance,
slow
effects,
sudden
bursts,
perseverance
and
weariness,
health
and
sickness.
Every
possibility
of
good
was
before
me,
and
the
first
of
blessings
secured,
in
obtaining
her
promises
of
faith
and
correspondence.
If
you
need
farther
explanation,
I
have
the
honour,
my
dear
madam,
of
being
your
husband's
son,
and
the
advantage
of
inheriting
a
disposition
to
hope
for
good,
which
no
inheritance
of
houses
or
lands
can
ever
equal
the
value
of.
See
me,
then,
under
these
circumstances,
arriving
on
my
first
visit
to
Randalls;
and
here
I
am
conscious
of
wrong,
for
that
visit
might
have
been
sooner
paid.
You
will
look
back
and
see
that
I
did
not
come
till
Miss
Fairfax
was
in
Highbury;
and
as
you
were
the
person
slighted,
you
will
forgive
me
instantly;
but
I
must
work
on
my
father's
compassion,
by
reminding
him,
that
so
long
as
I
absented
myself
from
his
house,
so
long
I
lost
the
blessing
of
knowing
you.
My
behaviour,
during
the
very
happy
fortnight
which
I
spent
with
you,
did
not,
I
hope,
lay
me
open
to
reprehension,
excepting
on
one
point.
And
now
I
come
to
the
principal,
the
only
important
part
of
my
conduct
while
belonging
to
you,
which
excites
my
own
anxiety,
or
requires
very
solicitous
explanation.
With
the
greatest
respect,
and
the
warmest
friendship,
do
I
mention
Miss
Woodhouse;
my
father
perhaps
will
think
I
ought
to
add,
with
the
deepest
humiliation.
A
few
words
which
dropped
from
him
yesterday
spoke
his
opinion,
and
some
censure
I
acknowledge
