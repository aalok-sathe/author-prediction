way
to
it
and
this
must
be
the
case
with
Mr.
Elton;
a
most
valuable,
amiable,
pleasing
young
man
undoubtedly,
and
very
much
in
love
with
Harriet;
but
still,
he
cannot
refuse
an
invitation,
he
must
dine
out
wherever
he
is
asked.
What
a
strange
thing
love
is!
he
can
see
ready
wit
in
Harriet,
but
will
not
dine
alone
for
her."
Soon
afterwards
Mr.
Elton
quitted
them,
and
she
could
not
but
do
him
the
justice
of
feeling
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
sentiment
in
his
manner
of
naming
Harriet
at
parting;
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
while
assuring
her
that
he
should
call
at
Mrs.
Goddard's
for
news
of
her
fair
friend,
the
last
thing
before
he
prepared
for
the
happiness
of
meeting
her
again,
when
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
give
a
better
report;
and
he
sighed
and
smiled
himself
off
in
a
way
that
left
the
balance
of
approbation
much
in
his
favour.
After
a
few
minutes
of
entire
silence
between
them,
John
Knightley
began
with
"I
never
in
my
life
saw
a
man
more
intent
on
being
agreeable
than
Mr.
Elton.
It
is
downright
labour
to
him
where
ladies
are
concerned.
With
men
he
can
be
rational
and
unaffected,
but
when
he
has
ladies
to
please,
every
feature
works."
"Mr.
Elton's
manners
are
not
perfect,"
replied
Emma;
"but
where
there
is
a
wish
to
please,
one
ought
to
overlook,
and
one
does
overlook
a
great
deal.
Where
a
man
does
his
best
with
only
moderate
powers,
he
will
have
the
advantage
over
negligent
superiority.
There
is
such
perfect
good
temper
and
good
will
in
Mr.
Elton
as
one
cannot
but
value."
"Yes,"
said
Mr.
John
Knightley
presently,
with
some
slyness,
"he
seems
to
have
a
great
deal
of
good
will
towards
you."
"Me!"
she
replied
with
a
smile
of
astonishment,
"are
you
imagining
me
to
be
Mr.
Elton's
object?"
"Such
an
imagination
has
crossed
me,
I
own,
Emma;
and
if
it
never
occurred
to
you
before,
you
may
as
well
take
it
into
consideration
now."
"Mr.
Elton
in
love
with
me!
What
an
idea!"
"I
do
not
say
it
is
so;
but
you
will
do
well
to
consider
whether
it
is
so
or
not,
and
to
regulate
your
behaviour
accordingly.
I
think
your
manners
to
him
encouraging.
I
speak
as
a
friend,
Emma.
You
had
better
look
about
you,
and
ascertain
what
you
do,
and
what
you
mean
to
do."
"I
thank
you;
but
I
assure
you
you
are
quite
mistaken.
Mr.
Elton
and
I
are
very
good
friends,
and
nothing
more;"
and
she
walked
on,
amusing
herself
in
the
consideration
of
the
blunders
which
often
arise
from
a
partial
knowledge
of
circumstances,
of
the
mistakes
which
people
of
high
pretensions
to
judgment
are
for
ever
falling
into;
and
not
very
well
pleased
with
her
brother
for
imagining
her
blind
and
ignorant,
and
in
want
of
counsel.
He
said
no
more.
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
so
completely
made
up
his
mind
to
