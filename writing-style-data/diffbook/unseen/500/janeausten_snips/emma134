be
shared
with
the
woman
he
loved,
he
could
not
think
any
man
to
be
pitied
for
having
that
house.
There
must
be
ample
room
in
it
for
every
real
comfort.
The
man
must
be
a
blockhead
who
wanted
more.
Mrs.
Weston
laughed,
and
said
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
talking
about.
Used
only
to
a
large
house
himself,
and
without
ever
thinking
how
many
advantages
and
accommodations
were
attached
to
its
size,
he
could
be
no
judge
of
the
privations
inevitably
belonging
to
a
small
one.
But
Emma,
in
her
own
mind,
determined
that
he
did
know
what
he
was
talking
about,
and
that
he
shewed
a
very
amiable
inclination
to
settle
early
in
life,
and
to
marry,
from
worthy
motives.
He
might
not
be
aware
of
the
inroads
on
domestic
peace
to
be
occasioned
by
no
housekeeper's
room,
or
a
bad
butler's
pantry,
but
no
doubt
he
did
perfectly
feel
that
Enscombe
could
not
make
him
happy,
and
that
whenever
he
were
attached,
he
would
willingly
give
up
much
of
wealth
to
be
allowed
an
early
establishment.
Emma's
very
good
opinion
of
Frank
Churchill
was
a
little
shaken
the
following
day,
by
hearing
that
he
was
gone
off
to
London,
merely
to
have
his
hair
cut.
A
sudden
freak
seemed
to
have
seized
him
at
breakfast,
and
he
had
sent
for
a
chaise
and
set
off,
intending
to
return
to
dinner,
but
with
no
more
important
view
that
appeared
than
having
his
hair
cut.
There
was
certainly
no
harm
in
his
travelling
sixteen
miles
twice
over
on
such
an
errand;
but
there
was
an
air
of
foppery
and
nonsense
in
it
which
she
could
not
approve.
It
did
not
accord
with
the
rationality
of
plan,
the
moderation
in
expense,
or
even
the
unselfish
warmth
of
heart,
which
she
had
believed
herself
to
discern
in
him
yesterday.
Vanity,
extravagance,
love
of
change,
restlessness
of
temper,
which
must
be
doing
something,
good
or
bad;
heedlessness
as
to
the
pleasure
of
his
father
and
Mrs.
Weston,
indifferent
as
to
how
his
conduct
might
appear
in
general;
he
became
liable
to
all
these
charges.
His
father
only
called
him
a
coxcomb,
and
thought
it
a
very
good
story;
but
that
Mrs.
Weston
did
not
like
it,
was
clear
enough,
by
her
passing
it
over
as
quickly
as
possible,
and
making
no
other
comment
than
that
"all
young
people
would
have
their
little
whims."
With
the
exception
of
this
little
blot,
Emma
found
that
his
visit
hitherto
had
given
her
friend
only
good
ideas
of
him.
Mrs.
Weston
was
very
ready
to
say
how
attentive
and
pleasant
a
companion
he
made
himself
how
much
she
saw
to
like
in
his
disposition
altogether.
He
appeared
to
have
a
very
open
temper
certainly
a
very
cheerful
and
lively
one;
she
could
observe
nothing
wrong
in
his
notions,
a
great
deal
decidedly
right;
he
spoke
of
his
uncle
with
warm
regard,
was
fond
of
talking
of
him
said
he
would
be
the
best
man
