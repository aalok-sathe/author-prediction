think
of
her,"
said
Emma,
"as
having
ever
been
any
thing
but
my
friend
and
my
dearest
friend."
He
looked
as
if
he
fully
understood
and
honoured
such
a
sentiment.
When
the
gloves
were
bought,
and
they
had
quitted
the
shop
again,
"Did
you
ever
hear
the
young
lady
we
were
speaking
of,
play?"
said
Frank
Churchill.
"Ever
hear
her!"
repeated
Emma.
"You
forget
how
much
she
belongs
to
Highbury.
I
have
heard
her
every
year
of
our
lives
since
we
both
began.
She
plays
charmingly."
"You
think
so,
do
you?
I
wanted
the
opinion
of
some
one
who
could
really
judge.
She
appeared
to
me
to
play
well,
that
is,
with
considerable
taste,
but
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter
myself.
I
am
excessively
fond
of
music,
but
without
the
smallest
skill
or
right
of
judging
of
any
body's
performance.
I
have
been
used
to
hear
her's
admired;
and
I
remember
one
proof
of
her
being
thought
to
play
well:
a
man,
a
very
musical
man,
and
in
love
with
another
woman
engaged
to
her
on
the
point
of
marriage
would
yet
never
ask
that
other
woman
to
sit
down
to
the
instrument,
if
the
lady
in
question
could
sit
down
instead
never
seemed
to
like
to
hear
one
if
he
could
hear
the
other.
That,
I
thought,
in
a
man
of
known
musical
talent,
was
some
proof."
"Proof
indeed!"
said
Emma,
highly
amused.
"Mr.
Dixon
is
very
musical,
is
he?
We
shall
know
more
about
them
all,
in
half
an
hour,
from
you,
than
Miss
Fairfax
would
have
vouchsafed
in
half
a
year."
"Yes,
Mr.
Dixon
and
Miss
Campbell
were
the
persons;
and
I
thought
it
a
very
strong
proof."
"Certainly
very
strong
it
was;
to
own
the
truth,
a
great
deal
stronger
than,
if
I
had
been
Miss
Campbell,
would
have
been
at
all
agreeable
to
me.
I
could
not
excuse
a
man's
having
more
music
than
love
more
ear
than
eye
a
more
acute
sensibility
to
fine
sounds
than
to
my
feelings.
How
did
Miss
Campbell
appear
to
like
it?"
"It
was
her
very
particular
friend,
you
know."
"Poor
comfort!"
said
Emma,
laughing.
"One
would
rather
have
a
stranger
preferred
than
one's
very
particular
friend
with
a
stranger
it
might
not
recur
again
but
the
misery
of
having
a
very
particular
friend
always
at
hand,
to
do
every
thing
better
than
one
does
oneself!
Poor
Mrs.
Dixon!
Well,
I
am
glad
she
is
gone
to
settle
in
Ireland."
"You
are
right.
It
was
not
very
flattering
to
Miss
Campbell;
but
she
really
did
not
seem
to
feel
it."
"So
much
the
better
or
so
much
the
worse:
I
do
not
know
which.
But
be
it
sweetness
or
be
it
stupidity
in
her
quickness
of
friendship,
or
dulness
of
feeling
there
was
one
person,
I
think,
who
must
have
felt
it:
Miss
Fairfax
herself.
She
must
have
felt
the
improper
and
dangerous
distinction."
"As
to
that
I
do
not
"
"Oh!
do
not
imagine
that
I
expect
