avoid
recommending
moderation
to
her,
as
well
in
her
hopes
as
her
fear;
and
after
talking
with
her
in
this
manner
till
dinner
was
on
the
table,
they
all
left
her
to
vent
all
her
feelings
on
the
housekeeper,
who
attended
in
the
absence
of
her
daughters.
Though
her
brother
and
sister
were
persuaded
that
there
was
no
real
occasion
for
such
a
seclusion
from
the
family,
they
did
not
attempt
to
oppose
it,
for
they
knew
that
she
had
not
prudence
enough
to
hold
her
tongue
before
the
servants,
while
they
waited
at
table,
and
judged
it
better
that
one
only
of
the
household,
and
the
one
whom
they
could
most
trust
should
comprehend
all
her
fears
and
solicitude
on
the
subject.
In
the
dining
room
they
were
soon
joined
by
Mary
and
Kitty,
who
had
been
too
busily
engaged
in
their
separate
apartments
to
make
their
appearance
before.
One
came
from
her
books,
and
the
other
from
her
toilette.
The
faces
of
both,
however,
were
tolerably
calm;
and
no
change
was
visible
in
either,
except
that
the
loss
of
her
favourite
sister,
or
the
anger
which
she
had
herself
incurred
in
this
business,
had
given
more
of
fretfulness
than
usual
to
the
accents
of
Kitty.
As
for
Mary,
she
was
mistress
enough
of
herself
to
whisper
to
Elizabeth,
with
a
countenance
of
grave
reflection,
soon
after
they
were
seated
at
table:
"This
is
a
most
unfortunate
affair,
and
will
probably
be
much
talked
of.
But
we
must
stem
the
tide
of
malice,
and
pour
into
the
wounded
bosoms
of
each
other
the
balm
of
sisterly
consolation."
Then,
perceiving
in
Elizabeth
no
inclination
of
replying,
she
added,
"Unhappy
as
the
event
must
be
for
Lydia,
we
may
draw
from
it
this
useful
lesson:
that
loss
of
virtue
in
a
female
is
irretrievable;
that
one
false
step
involves
her
in
endless
ruin;
that
her
reputation
is
no
less
brittle
than
it
is
beautiful;
and
that
she
cannot
be
too
much
guarded
in
her
behaviour
towards
the
undeserving
of
the
other
sex."
Elizabeth
lifted
up
her
eyes
in
amazement,
but
was
too
much
oppressed
to
make
any
reply.
Mary,
however,
continued
to
console
herself
with
such
kind
of
moral
extractions
from
the
evil
before
them.
In
the
afternoon,
the
two
elder
Miss
Bennets
were
able
to
be
for
half
an
hour
by
themselves;
and
Elizabeth
instantly
availed
herself
of
the
opportunity
of
making
any
inquiries,
which
Jane
was
equally
eager
to
satisfy.
After
joining
in
general
lamentations
over
the
dreadful
sequel
of
this
event,
which
Elizabeth
considered
as
all
but
certain,
and
Miss
Bennet
could
not
assert
to
be
wholly
impossible,
the
former
continued
the
subject,
by
saying,
"But
tell
me
all
and
everything
about
it
which
I
have
not
already
heard.
Give
me
further
particulars.
What
did
Colonel
Forster
say?
Had
they
no
apprehension
of
anything
before
the
elopement
took
place?
They
must
have
seen
them
together
for
ever."
"Colonel
Forster
did
own
that
he
had
often
suspected
some
partiality,
