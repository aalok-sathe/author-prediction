a
look
of
escape.
Little
expecting
to
meet
Miss
Woodhouse
so
soon,
there
was
a
start
at
first;
but
Miss
Woodhouse
was
the
very
person
she
was
in
quest
of.
"Will
you
be
so
kind,"
said
she,
"when
I
am
missed,
as
to
say
that
I
am
gone
home?
I
am
going
this
moment.
My
aunt
is
not
aware
how
late
it
is,
nor
how
long
we
have
been
absent
but
I
am
sure
we
shall
be
wanted,
and
I
am
determined
to
go
directly.
I
have
said
nothing
about
it
to
any
body.
It
would
only
be
giving
trouble
and
distress.
Some
are
gone
to
the
ponds,
and
some
to
the
lime
walk.
Till
they
all
come
in
I
shall
not
be
missed;
and
when
they
do,
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
say
that
I
am
gone?"
"Certainly,
if
you
wish
it;
but
you
are
not
going
to
walk
to
Highbury
alone?"
"Yes
what
should
hurt
me?
I
walk
fast.
I
shall
be
at
home
in
twenty
minutes."
"But
it
is
too
far,
indeed
it
is,
to
be
walking
quite
alone.
Let
my
father's
servant
go
with
you.
Let
me
order
the
carriage.
It
can
be
round
in
five
minutes."
"Thank
you,
thank
you
but
on
no
account.
I
would
rather
walk.
And
for
me
to
be
afraid
of
walking
alone!
I,
who
may
so
soon
have
to
guard
others!"
She
spoke
with
great
agitation;
and
Emma
very
feelingly
replied,
"That
can
be
no
reason
for
your
being
exposed
to
danger
now.
I
must
order
the
carriage.
The
heat
even
would
be
danger.
You
are
fatigued
already."
"I
am,"
she
answered
"I
am
fatigued;
but
it
is
not
the
sort
of
fatigue
quick
walking
will
refresh
me.
Miss
Woodhouse,
we
all
know
at
times
what
it
is
to
be
wearied
in
spirits.
Mine,
I
confess,
are
exhausted.
The
greatest
kindness
you
can
shew
me,
will
be
to
let
me
have
my
own
way,
and
only
say
that
I
am
gone
when
it
is
necessary."
Emma
had
not
another
word
to
oppose.
She
saw
it
all;
and
entering
into
her
feelings,
promoted
her
quitting
the
house
immediately,
and
watched
her
safely
off
with
the
zeal
of
a
friend.
Her
parting
look
was
grateful
and
her
parting
words,
"Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
the
comfort
of
being
sometimes
alone!"
seemed
to
burst
from
an
overcharged
heart,
and
to
describe
somewhat
of
the
continual
endurance
to
be
practised
by
her,
even
towards
some
of
those
who
loved
her
best.
"Such
a
home,
indeed!
such
an
aunt!"
said
Emma,
as
she
turned
back
into
the
hall
again.
"I
do
pity
you.
And
the
more
sensibility
you
betray
of
their
just
horrors,
the
more
I
shall
like
you."
Jane
had
not
been
gone
a
quarter
of
an
hour,
and
they
had
only
accomplished
some
views
of
St.
Mark's
Place,
Venice,
when
Frank
Churchill
entered
the
room.
Emma
had
not
been
thinking
of
him,
she
had
forgotten
to
think
of
him
but
she
was
very
glad
