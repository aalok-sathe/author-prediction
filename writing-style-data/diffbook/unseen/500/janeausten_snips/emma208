and
speedily
determine
how
he
was
influenced,
and
how
she
must
act.
They
met
with
the
utmost
friendliness.
There
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
great
pleasure
in
seeing
her.
But
she
had
an
almost
instant
doubt
of
his
caring
for
her
as
he
had
done,
of
his
feeling
the
same
tenderness
in
the
same
degree.
She
watched
him
well.
It
was
a
clear
thing
he
was
less
in
love
than
he
had
been.
Absence,
with
the
conviction
probably
of
her
indifference,
had
produced
this
very
natural
and
very
desirable
effect.
He
was
in
high
spirits;
as
ready
to
talk
and
laugh
as
ever,
and
seemed
delighted
to
speak
of
his
former
visit,
and
recur
to
old
stories:
and
he
was
not
without
agitation.
It
was
not
in
his
calmness
that
she
read
his
comparative
difference.
He
was
not
calm;
his
spirits
were
evidently
fluttered;
there
was
restlessness
about
him.
Lively
as
he
was,
it
seemed
a
liveliness
that
did
not
satisfy
himself;
but
what
decided
her
belief
on
the
subject,
was
his
staying
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour,
and
hurrying
away
to
make
other
calls
in
Highbury.
"He
had
seen
a
group
of
old
acquaintance
in
the
street
as
he
passed
he
had
not
stopped,
he
would
not
stop
for
more
than
a
word
but
he
had
the
vanity
to
think
they
would
be
disappointed
if
he
did
not
call,
and
much
as
he
wished
to
stay
longer
at
Hartfield,
he
must
hurry
off."
She
had
no
doubt
as
to
his
being
less
in
love
but
neither
his
agitated
spirits,
nor
his
hurrying
away,
seemed
like
a
perfect
cure;
and
she
was
rather
inclined
to
think
it
implied
a
dread
of
her
returning
power,
and
a
discreet
resolution
of
not
trusting
himself
with
her
long.
This
was
the
only
visit
from
Frank
Churchill
in
the
course
of
ten
days.
He
was
often
hoping,
intending
to
come
but
was
always
prevented.
His
aunt
could
not
bear
to
have
him
leave
her.
Such
was
his
own
account
at
Randall's.
If
he
were
quite
sincere,
if
he
really
tried
to
come,
it
was
to
be
inferred
that
Mrs.
Churchill's
removal
to
London
had
been
of
no
service
to
the
wilful
or
nervous
part
of
her
disorder.
That
she
was
really
ill
was
very
certain;
he
had
declared
himself
convinced
of
it,
at
Randalls.
Though
much
might
be
fancy,
he
could
not
doubt,
when
he
looked
back,
that
she
was
in
a
weaker
state
of
health
than
she
had
been
half
a
year
ago.
He
did
not
believe
it
to
proceed
from
any
thing
that
care
and
medicine
might
not
remove,
or
at
least
that
she
might
not
have
many
years
of
existence
before
her;
but
he
could
not
be
prevailed
on,
by
all
his
father's
doubts,
to
say
that
her
complaints
were
merely
imaginary,
or
that
she
was
as
strong
as
ever.
It
soon
appeared
that
London
was
not
the
place
for
her.
She
could
not
endure
its
noise.
Her
nerves
