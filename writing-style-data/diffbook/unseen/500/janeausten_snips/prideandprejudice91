All
that
I
can
promise
you,
therefore,
is
not
to
be
in
a
hurry.
I
will
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
believe
myself
his
first
object.
When
I
am
in
company
with
him,
I
will
not
be
wishing.
In
short,
I
will
do
my
best."
"Perhaps
it
will
be
as
well
if
you
discourage
his
coming
here
so
very
often.
At
least,
you
should
not
remind
your
mother
of
inviting
him."
"As
I
did
the
other
day,"
said
Elizabeth
with
a
conscious
smile:
"very
true,
it
will
be
wise
in
me
to
refrain
from
that.
But
do
not
imagine
that
he
is
always
here
so
often.
It
is
on
your
account
that
he
has
been
so
frequently
invited
this
week.
You
know
my
mother's
ideas
as
to
the
necessity
of
constant
company
for
her
friends.
But
really,
and
upon
my
honour,
I
will
try
to
do
what
I
think
to
be
the
wisest;
and
now
I
hope
you
are
satisfied."
Her
aunt
assured
her
that
she
was,
and
Elizabeth
having
thanked
her
for
the
kindness
of
her
hints,
they
parted;
a
wonderful
instance
of
advice
being
given
on
such
a
point,
without
being
resented.
Mr.
Collins
returned
into
Hertfordshire
soon
after
it
had
been
quitted
by
the
Gardiners
and
Jane;
but
as
he
took
up
his
abode
with
the
Lucases,
his
arrival
was
no
great
inconvenience
to
Mrs.
Bennet.
His
marriage
was
now
fast
approaching,
and
she
was
at
length
so
far
resigned
as
to
think
it
inevitable,
and
even
repeatedly
to
say,
in
an
ill
natured
tone,
that
she
"wished
they
might
be
happy."
Thursday
was
to
be
the
wedding
day,
and
on
Wednesday
Miss
Lucas
paid
her
farewell
visit;
and
when
she
rose
to
take
leave,
Elizabeth,
ashamed
of
her
mother's
ungracious
and
reluctant
good
wishes,
and
sincerely
affected
herself,
accompanied
her
out
of
the
room.
As
they
went
downstairs
together,
Charlotte
said:
"I
shall
depend
on
hearing
from
you
very
often,
Eliza."
"That
you
certainly
shall."
"And
I
have
another
favour
to
ask
you.
Will
you
come
and
see
me?"
"We
shall
often
meet,
I
hope,
in
Hertfordshire."
"I
am
not
likely
to
leave
Kent
for
some
time.
Promise
me,
therefore,
to
come
to
Hunsford."
Elizabeth
could
not
refuse,
though
she
foresaw
little
pleasure
in
the
visit.
"My
father
and
Maria
are
coming
to
me
in
March,"
added
Charlotte,
"and
I
hope
you
will
consent
to
be
of
the
party.
Indeed,
Eliza,
you
will
be
as
welcome
as
either
of
them."
The
wedding
took
place;
the
bride
and
bridegroom
set
off
for
Kent
from
the
church
door,
and
everybody
had
as
much
to
say,
or
to
hear,
on
the
subject
as
usual.
Elizabeth
soon
heard
from
her
friend;
and
their
correspondence
was
as
regular
and
frequent
as
it
had
ever
been;
that
it
should
be
equally
unreserved
was
impossible.
Elizabeth
could
never
address
her
without
feeling
that
all
the
comfort
of
intimacy
was
over,
and
though
determined
not
to
slacken
as
a
correspondent,
it
was
for
