again
to
be
quite
certain,
and
quite
mistress
of
the
lines,
and
then
passing
it
to
Harriet,
sat
happily
smiling,
and
saying
to
herself,
while
Harriet
was
puzzling
over
the
paper
in
all
the
confusion
of
hope
and
dulness,
"Very
well,
Mr.
Elton,
very
well
indeed.
I
have
read
worse
charades.
Courtship
a
very
good
hint.
I
give
you
credit
for
it.
This
is
feeling
your
way.
This
is
saying
very
plainly
'Pray,
Miss
Smith,
give
me
leave
to
pay
my
addresses
to
you.
Approve
my
charade
and
my
intentions
in
the
same
glance.'
May
its
approval
beam
in
that
soft
eye!
Harriet
exactly.
Soft
is
the
very
word
for
her
eye
of
all
epithets,
the
justest
that
could
be
given.
Thy
ready
wit
the
word
will
soon
supply.
Humph
Harriet's
ready
wit!
All
the
better.
A
man
must
be
very
much
in
love,
indeed,
to
describe
her
so.
Ah!
Mr.
Knightley,
I
wish
you
had
the
benefit
of
this;
I
think
this
would
convince
you.
For
once
in
your
life
you
would
be
obliged
to
own
yourself
mistaken.
An
excellent
charade
indeed!
and
very
much
to
the
purpose.
Things
must
come
to
a
crisis
soon
now."
She
was
obliged
to
break
off
from
these
very
pleasant
observations,
which
were
otherwise
of
a
sort
to
run
into
great
length,
by
the
eagerness
of
Harriet's
wondering
questions.
"What
can
it
be,
Miss
Woodhouse?
what
can
it
be?
I
have
not
an
idea
I
cannot
guess
it
in
the
least.
What
can
it
possibly
be?
Do
try
to
find
it
out,
Miss
Woodhouse.
Do
help
me.
I
never
saw
any
thing
so
hard.
Is
it
kingdom?
I
wonder
who
the
friend
was
and
who
could
be
the
young
lady.
Do
you
think
it
is
a
good
one?
Can
it
be
woman?
And
woman,
lovely
woman,
reigns
alone.
Can
it
be
Neptune?
Behold
him
there,
the
monarch
of
the
seas!
Or
a
trident?
or
a
mermaid?
or
a
shark?
Oh,
no!
shark
is
only
one
syllable.
It
must
be
very
clever,
or
he
would
not
have
brought
it.
Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
do
you
think
we
shall
ever
find
it
out?"
"Mermaids
and
sharks!
Nonsense!
My
dear
Harriet,
what
are
you
thinking
of?
Where
would
be
the
use
of
his
bringing
us
a
charade
made
by
a
friend
upon
a
mermaid
or
a
shark?
Give
me
the
paper
and
listen.
For
Miss
,
read
Miss
Smith.
My
first
displays
the
wealth
and
pomp
of
kings,
Lords
of
the
earth!
their
luxury
and
ease.
That
is
court.
Another
view
of
man,
my
second
brings;
Behold
him
there,
the
monarch
of
the
seas!
That
is
ship;
plain
as
it
can
be.
Now
for
the
cream.
But
ah!
united,
(courtship,
you
know,)
what
reverse
we
have!
Man's
boasted
power
and
freedom,
all
are
flown.
Lord
of
the
earth
and
sea,
he
bends
a
slave,
And
woman,
lovely
woman,
reigns
alone.
A
very
proper
compliment!
and
then
follows
the
application,
which
I
think,
my
dear
Harriet,
you
cannot
