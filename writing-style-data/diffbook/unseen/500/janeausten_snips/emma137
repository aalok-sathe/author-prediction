the
more
readily
to
give
them
the
honour
of
his
company."
Upon
the
whole,
she
was
very
persuadable;
and
it
being
briefly
settled
among
themselves
how
it
might
be
done
without
neglecting
his
comfort
how
certainly
Mrs.
Goddard,
if
not
Mrs.
Bates,
might
be
depended
on
for
bearing
him
company
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
to
be
talked
into
an
acquiescence
of
his
daughter's
going
out
to
dinner
on
a
day
now
near
at
hand,
and
spending
the
whole
evening
away
from
him.
As
for
his
going,
Emma
did
not
wish
him
to
think
it
possible,
the
hours
would
be
too
late,
and
the
party
too
numerous.
He
was
soon
pretty
well
resigned.
"I
am
not
fond
of
dinner
visiting,"
said
he
"I
never
was.
No
more
is
Emma.
Late
hours
do
not
agree
with
us.
I
am
sorry
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cole
should
have
done
it.
I
think
it
would
be
much
better
if
they
would
come
in
one
afternoon
next
summer,
and
take
their
tea
with
us
take
us
in
their
afternoon
walk;
which
they
might
do,
as
our
hours
are
so
reasonable,
and
yet
get
home
without
being
out
in
the
damp
of
the
evening.
The
dews
of
a
summer
evening
are
what
I
would
not
expose
any
body
to.
However,
as
they
are
so
very
desirous
to
have
dear
Emma
dine
with
them,
and
as
you
will
both
be
there,
and
Mr.
Knightley
too,
to
take
care
of
her,
I
cannot
wish
to
prevent
it,
provided
the
weather
be
what
it
ought,
neither
damp,
nor
cold,
nor
windy."
Then
turning
to
Mrs.
Weston,
with
a
look
of
gentle
reproach
"Ah!
Miss
Taylor,
if
you
had
not
married,
you
would
have
staid
at
home
with
me."
"Well,
sir,"
cried
Mr.
Weston,
"as
I
took
Miss
Taylor
away,
it
is
incumbent
on
me
to
supply
her
place,
if
I
can;
and
I
will
step
to
Mrs.
Goddard
in
a
moment,
if
you
wish
it."
But
the
idea
of
any
thing
to
be
done
in
a
moment,
was
increasing,
not
lessening,
Mr.
Woodhouse's
agitation.
The
ladies
knew
better
how
to
allay
it.
Mr.
Weston
must
be
quiet,
and
every
thing
deliberately
arranged.
With
this
treatment,
Mr.
Woodhouse
was
soon
composed
enough
for
talking
as
usual.
"He
should
be
happy
to
see
Mrs.
Goddard.
He
had
a
great
regard
for
Mrs.
Goddard;
and
Emma
should
write
a
line,
and
invite
her.
James
could
take
the
note.
But
first
of
all,
there
must
be
an
answer
written
to
Mrs.
Cole."
"You
will
make
my
excuses,
my
dear,
as
civilly
as
possible.
You
will
say
that
I
am
quite
an
invalid,
and
go
no
where,
and
therefore
must
decline
their
obliging
invitation;
beginning
with
my
compliments,
of
course.
But
you
will
do
every
thing
right.
I
need
not
tell
you
what
is
to
be
done.
We
must
remember
to
let
James
know
that
the
carriage
will
be
wanted
on
Tuesday.
I
shall
have
no
fears
for
you
with
him.
We
have
never
been
there
