you
do?
Very
well
I
thank
you,
quite
well.
This
is
meeting
quite
in
fairy
land!
Such
a
transformation!
Must
not
compliment,
I
know
(eyeing
Emma
most
complacently)
that
would
be
rude
but
upon
my
word,
Miss
Woodhouse,
you
do
look
how
do
you
like
Jane's
hair?
You
are
a
judge.
She
did
it
all
herself.
Quite
wonderful
how
she
does
her
hair!
No
hairdresser
from
London
I
think
could.
Ah!
Dr.
Hughes
I
declare
and
Mrs.
Hughes.
Must
go
and
speak
to
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Hughes
for
a
moment.
How
do
you
do?
How
do
you
do?
Very
well,
I
thank
you.
This
is
delightful,
is
not
it?
Where's
dear
Mr.
Richard?
Oh!
there
he
is.
Don't
disturb
him.
Much
better
employed
talking
to
the
young
ladies.
How
do
you
do,
Mr.
Richard?
I
saw
you
the
other
day
as
you
rode
through
the
town
Mrs.
Otway,
I
protest!
and
good
Mr.
Otway,
and
Miss
Otway
and
Miss
Caroline.
Such
a
host
of
friends!
and
Mr.
George
and
Mr.
Arthur!
How
do
you
do?
How
do
you
all
do?
Quite
well,
I
am
much
obliged
to
you.
Never
better.
Don't
I
hear
another
carriage?
Who
can
this
be?
very
likely
the
worthy
Coles.
Upon
my
word,
this
is
charming
to
be
standing
about
among
such
friends!
And
such
a
noble
fire!
I
am
quite
roasted.
No
coffee,
I
thank
you,
for
me
never
take
coffee.
A
little
tea
if
you
please,
sir,
by
and
bye,
no
hurry
Oh!
here
it
comes.
Every
thing
so
good!"
Frank
Churchill
returned
to
his
station
by
Emma;
and
as
soon
as
Miss
Bates
was
quiet,
she
found
herself
necessarily
overhearing
the
discourse
of
Mrs.
Elton
and
Miss
Fairfax,
who
were
standing
a
little
way
behind
her.
He
was
thoughtful.
Whether
he
were
overhearing
too,
she
could
not
determine.
After
a
good
many
compliments
to
Jane
on
her
dress
and
look,
compliments
very
quietly
and
properly
taken,
Mrs.
Elton
was
evidently
wanting
to
be
complimented
herself
and
it
was,
"How
do
you
like
my
gown?
How
do
you
like
my
trimming?
How
has
Wright
done
my
hair?"
with
many
other
relative
questions,
all
answered
with
patient
politeness.
Mrs.
Elton
then
said,
"Nobody
can
think
less
of
dress
in
general
than
I
do
but
upon
such
an
occasion
as
this,
when
every
body's
eyes
are
so
much
upon
me,
and
in
compliment
to
the
Westons
who
I
have
no
doubt
are
giving
this
ball
chiefly
to
do
me
honour
I
would
not
wish
to
be
inferior
to
others.
And
I
see
very
few
pearls
in
the
room
except
mine.
So
Frank
Churchill
is
a
capital
dancer,
I
understand.
We
shall
see
if
our
styles
suit.
A
fine
young
man
certainly
is
Frank
Churchill.
I
like
him
very
well."
At
this
moment
Frank
began
talking
so
vigorously,
that
Emma
could
not
but
imagine
he
had
overheard
his
own
praises,
and
did
not
want
to
hear
more;
and
the
voices
of
the
ladies
were
drowned
for
a
