of
young
man
to
get
into
a
scrape
of
that
sort,
and
from
knowing
them
to
have
been
together
the
whole
of
last
summer."
"Did
Mr.
Darcy
give
you
reasons
for
this
interference?"
"I
understood
that
there
were
some
very
strong
objections
against
the
lady."
"And
what
arts
did
he
use
to
separate
them?"
"He
did
not
talk
to
me
of
his
own
arts,"
said
Fitzwilliam,
smiling.
"He
only
told
me
what
I
have
now
told
you."
Elizabeth
made
no
answer,
and
walked
on,
her
heart
swelling
with
indignation.
After
watching
her
a
little,
Fitzwilliam
asked
her
why
she
was
so
thoughtful.
"I
am
thinking
of
what
you
have
been
telling
me,"
said
she.
"Your
cousin's
conduct
does
not
suit
my
feelings.
Why
was
he
to
be
the
judge?"
"You
are
rather
disposed
to
call
his
interference
officious?"
"I
do
not
see
what
right
Mr.
Darcy
had
to
decide
on
the
propriety
of
his
friend's
inclination,
or
why,
upon
his
own
judgement
alone,
he
was
to
determine
and
direct
in
what
manner
his
friend
was
to
be
happy.
But,"
she
continued,
recollecting
herself,
"as
we
know
none
of
the
particulars,
it
is
not
fair
to
condemn
him.
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
there
was
much
affection
in
the
case."
"That
is
not
an
unnatural
surmise,"
said
Fitzwilliam,
"but
it
is
a
lessening
of
the
honour
of
my
cousin's
triumph
very
sadly."
This
was
spoken
jestingly;
but
it
appeared
to
her
so
just
a
picture
of
Mr.
Darcy,
that
she
would
not
trust
herself
with
an
answer,
and
therefore,
abruptly
changing
the
conversation
talked
on
indifferent
matters
until
they
reached
the
Parsonage.
There,
shut
into
her
own
room,
as
soon
as
their
visitor
left
them,
she
could
think
without
interruption
of
all
that
she
had
heard.
It
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
any
other
people
could
be
meant
than
those
with
whom
she
was
connected.
There
could
not
exist
in
the
world
two
men
over
whom
Mr.
Darcy
could
have
such
boundless
influence.
That
he
had
been
concerned
in
the
measures
taken
to
separate
Bingley
and
Jane
she
had
never
doubted;
but
she
had
always
attributed
to
Miss
Bingley
the
principal
design
and
arrangement
of
them.
If
his
own
vanity,
however,
did
not
mislead
him,
he
was
the
cause,
his
pride
and
caprice
were
the
cause,
of
all
that
Jane
had
suffered,
and
still
continued
to
suffer.
He
had
ruined
for
a
while
every
hope
of
happiness
for
the
most
affectionate,
generous
heart
in
the
world;
and
no
one
could
say
how
lasting
an
evil
he
might
have
inflicted.
"There
were
some
very
strong
objections
against
the
lady,"
were
Colonel
Fitzwilliam's
words;
and
those
strong
objections
probably
were,
her
having
one
uncle
who
was
a
country
attorney,
and
another
who
was
in
business
in
London.
"To
Jane
herself,"
she
exclaimed,
"there
could
be
no
possibility
of
objection;
all
loveliness
and
goodness
as
she
is!
her
understanding
excellent,
her
mind
improved,
and
her
manners
captivating.
Neither
could
anything
be
