sooner
did
he
appear
than
Elizabeth
wisely
resolved
to
be
perfectly
easy
and
unembarrassed;
a
resolution
the
more
necessary
to
be
made,
but
perhaps
not
the
more
easily
kept,
because
she
saw
that
the
suspicions
of
the
whole
party
were
awakened
against
them,
and
that
there
was
scarcely
an
eye
which
did
not
watch
his
behaviour
when
he
first
came
into
the
room.
In
no
countenance
was
attentive
curiosity
so
strongly
marked
as
in
Miss
Bingley's,
in
spite
of
the
smiles
which
overspread
her
face
whenever
she
spoke
to
one
of
its
objects;
for
jealousy
had
not
yet
made
her
desperate,
and
her
attentions
to
Mr.
Darcy
were
by
no
means
over.
Miss
Darcy,
on
her
brother's
entrance,
exerted
herself
much
more
to
talk,
and
Elizabeth
saw
that
he
was
anxious
for
his
sister
and
herself
to
get
acquainted,
and
forwarded
as
much
as
possible,
every
attempt
at
conversation
on
either
side.
Miss
Bingley
saw
all
this
likewise;
and,
in
the
imprudence
of
anger,
took
the
first
opportunity
of
saying,
with
sneering
civility:
"Pray,
Miss
Eliza,
are
not
the
shire
Militia
removed
from
Meryton?
They
must
be
a
great
loss
to
your
family."
In
Darcy's
presence
she
dared
not
mention
Wickham's
name;
but
Elizabeth
instantly
comprehended
that
he
was
uppermost
in
her
thoughts;
and
the
various
recollections
connected
with
him
gave
her
a
moment's
distress;
but
exerting
herself
vigorously
to
repel
the
ill
natured
attack,
she
presently
answered
the
question
in
a
tolerably
detached
tone.
While
she
spoke,
an
involuntary
glance
showed
her
Darcy,
with
a
heightened
complexion,
earnestly
looking
at
her,
and
his
sister
overcome
with
confusion,
and
unable
to
lift
up
her
eyes.
Had
Miss
Bingley
known
what
pain
she
was
then
giving
her
beloved
friend,
she
undoubtedly
would
have
refrained
from
the
hint;
but
she
had
merely
intended
to
discompose
Elizabeth
by
bringing
forward
the
idea
of
a
man
to
whom
she
believed
her
partial,
to
make
her
betray
a
sensibility
which
might
injure
her
in
Darcy's
opinion,
and,
perhaps,
to
remind
the
latter
of
all
the
follies
and
absurdities
by
which
some
part
of
her
family
were
connected
with
that
corps.
Not
a
syllable
had
ever
reached
her
of
Miss
Darcy's
meditated
elopement.
To
no
creature
had
it
been
revealed,
where
secrecy
was
possible,
except
to
Elizabeth;
and
from
all
Bingley's
connections
her
brother
was
particularly
anxious
to
conceal
it,
from
the
very
wish
which
Elizabeth
had
long
ago
attributed
to
him,
of
their
becoming
hereafter
her
own.
He
had
certainly
formed
such
a
plan,
and
without
meaning
that
it
should
affect
his
endeavour
to
separate
him
from
Miss
Bennet,
it
is
probable
that
it
might
add
something
to
his
lively
concern
for
the
welfare
of
his
friend.
Elizabeth's
collected
behaviour,
however,
soon
quieted
his
emotion;
and
as
Miss
Bingley,
vexed
and
disappointed,
dared
not
approach
nearer
to
Wickham,
Georgiana
also
recovered
in
time,
though
not
enough
to
be
able
to
speak
any
more.
Her
brother,
whose
eye
she
feared
to
meet,
scarcely
recollected
her
interest
