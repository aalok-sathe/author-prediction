to
her
was
unabated,
I
felt
no
doubt
of
their
happiness
together."
Elizabeth
could
not
help
smiling
at
his
easy
manner
of
directing
his
friend.
"Did
you
speak
from
your
own
observation,"
said
she,
"when
you
told
him
that
my
sister
loved
him,
or
merely
from
my
information
last
spring?"
"From
the
former.
I
had
narrowly
observed
her
during
the
two
visits
which
I
had
lately
made
here;
and
I
was
convinced
of
her
affection."
"And
your
assurance
of
it,
I
suppose,
carried
immediate
conviction
to
him."
"It
did.
Bingley
is
most
unaffectedly
modest.
His
diffidence
had
prevented
his
depending
on
his
own
judgment
in
so
anxious
a
case,
but
his
reliance
on
mine
made
every
thing
easy.
I
was
obliged
to
confess
one
thing,
which
for
a
time,
and
not
unjustly,
offended
him.
I
could
not
allow
myself
to
conceal
that
your
sister
had
been
in
town
three
months
last
winter,
that
I
had
known
it,
and
purposely
kept
it
from
him.
He
was
angry.
But
his
anger,
I
am
persuaded,
lasted
no
longer
than
he
remained
in
any
doubt
of
your
sister's
sentiments.
He
has
heartily
forgiven
me
now."
Elizabeth
longed
to
observe
that
Mr.
Bingley
had
been
a
most
delightful
friend;
so
easily
guided
that
his
worth
was
invaluable;
but
she
checked
herself.
She
remembered
that
he
had
yet
to
learn
to
be
laughed
at,
and
it
was
rather
too
early
to
begin.
In
anticipating
the
happiness
of
Bingley,
which
of
course
was
to
be
inferior
only
to
his
own,
he
continued
the
conversation
till
they
reached
the
house.
In
the
hall
they
parted.
"My
dear
Lizzy,
where
can
you
have
been
walking
to?"
was
a
question
which
Elizabeth
received
from
Jane
as
soon
as
she
entered
their
room,
and
from
all
the
others
when
they
sat
down
to
table.
She
had
only
to
say
in
reply,
that
they
had
wandered
about,
till
she
was
beyond
her
own
knowledge.
She
coloured
as
she
spoke;
but
neither
that,
nor
anything
else,
awakened
a
suspicion
of
the
truth.
The
evening
passed
quietly,
unmarked
by
anything
extraordinary.
The
acknowledged
lovers
talked
and
laughed,
the
unacknowledged
were
silent.
Darcy
was
not
of
a
disposition
in
which
happiness
overflows
in
mirth;
and
Elizabeth,
agitated
and
confused,
rather
knew
that
she
was
happy
than
felt
herself
to
be
so;
for,
besides
the
immediate
embarrassment,
there
were
other
evils
before
her.
She
anticipated
what
would
be
felt
in
the
family
when
her
situation
became
known;
she
was
aware
that
no
one
liked
him
but
Jane;
and
even
feared
that
with
the
others
it
was
a
dislike
which
not
all
his
fortune
and
consequence
might
do
away.
At
night
she
opened
her
heart
to
Jane.
Though
suspicion
was
very
far
from
Miss
Bennet's
general
habits,
she
was
absolutely
incredulous
here.
"You
are
joking,
Lizzy.
This
cannot
be!
engaged
to
Mr.
Darcy!
No,
no,
you
shall
not
deceive
me.
I
know
it
to
be
impossible."
"This
is
a
wretched
beginning
indeed!
My
sole
dependence
was
on
