have
you
all
meet
so!
Our
little
room
so
honoured!"
She
was
in
the
adjoining
chamber
while
she
still
spoke,
and
opening
the
casement
there,
immediately
called
Mr.
Knightley's
attention,
and
every
syllable
of
their
conversation
was
as
distinctly
heard
by
the
others,
as
if
it
had
passed
within
the
same
apartment.
"How
d'
ye
do?
how
d'ye
do?
Very
well,
I
thank
you.
So
obliged
to
you
for
the
carriage
last
night.
We
were
just
in
time;
my
mother
just
ready
for
us.
Pray
come
in;
do
come
in.
You
will
find
some
friends
here."
So
began
Miss
Bates;
and
Mr.
Knightley
seemed
determined
to
be
heard
in
his
turn,
for
most
resolutely
and
commandingly
did
he
say,
"How
is
your
niece,
Miss
Bates?
I
want
to
inquire
after
you
all,
but
particularly
your
niece.
How
is
Miss
Fairfax?
I
hope
she
caught
no
cold
last
night.
How
is
she
to
day?
Tell
me
how
Miss
Fairfax
is."
And
Miss
Bates
was
obliged
to
give
a
direct
answer
before
he
would
hear
her
in
any
thing
else.
The
listeners
were
amused;
and
Mrs.
Weston
gave
Emma
a
look
of
particular
meaning.
But
Emma
still
shook
her
head
in
steady
scepticism.
"So
obliged
to
you!
so
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
carriage,"
resumed
Miss
Bates.
He
cut
her
short
with,
"I
am
going
to
Kingston.
Can
I
do
any
thing
for
you?"
"Oh!
dear,
Kingston
are
you?
Mrs.
Cole
was
saying
the
other
day
she
wanted
something
from
Kingston."
"Mrs.
Cole
has
servants
to
send.
Can
I
do
any
thing
for
you?"
"No,
I
thank
you.
But
do
come
in.
Who
do
you
think
is
here?
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Miss
Smith;
so
kind
as
to
call
to
hear
the
new
pianoforte.
Do
put
up
your
horse
at
the
Crown,
and
come
in."
"Well,"
said
he,
in
a
deliberating
manner,
"for
five
minutes,
perhaps."
"And
here
is
Mrs.
Weston
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
too!
Quite
delightful;
so
many
friends!"
"No,
not
now,
I
thank
you.
I
could
not
stay
two
minutes.
I
must
get
on
to
Kingston
as
fast
as
I
can."
"Oh!
do
come
in.
They
will
be
so
very
happy
to
see
you."
"No,
no;
your
room
is
full
enough.
I
will
call
another
day,
and
hear
the
pianoforte."
"Well,
I
am
so
sorry!
Oh!
Mr.
Knightley,
what
a
delightful
party
last
night;
how
extremely
pleasant.
Did
you
ever
see
such
dancing?
Was
not
it
delightful?
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill;
I
never
saw
any
thing
equal
to
it."
"Oh!
very
delightful
indeed;
I
can
say
nothing
less,
for
I
suppose
Miss
Woodhouse
and
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
are
hearing
every
thing
that
passes.
And
(raising
his
voice
still
more)
I
do
not
see
why
Miss
Fairfax
should
not
be
mentioned
too.
I
think
Miss
Fairfax
dances
very
well;
and
Mrs.
Weston
is
the
very
best
country
dance
player,
without
exception,
in
England.
Now,
if
your
friends
have
any
gratitude,
they
will
say
something
pretty
loud
about
