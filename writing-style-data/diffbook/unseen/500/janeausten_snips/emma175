unadorned
as
it
was
by
any
such
broad
wreath
of
gallantry,
she
yet
could
discern
the
effect
of
her
influence
and
acknowledge
the
greatest
compliment
perhaps
of
all
conveyed.
Compressed
into
the
very
lowest
vacant
corner
were
these
words
"I
had
not
a
spare
moment
on
Tuesday,
as
you
know,
for
Miss
Woodhouse's
beautiful
little
friend.
Pray
make
my
excuses
and
adieus
to
her."
This,
Emma
could
not
doubt,
was
all
for
herself.
Harriet
was
remembered
only
from
being
her
friend.
His
information
and
prospects
as
to
Enscombe
were
neither
worse
nor
better
than
had
been
anticipated;
Mrs.
Churchill
was
recovering,
and
he
dared
not
yet,
even
in
his
own
imagination,
fix
a
time
for
coming
to
Randalls
again.
Gratifying,
however,
and
stimulative
as
was
the
letter
in
the
material
part,
its
sentiments,
she
yet
found,
when
it
was
folded
up
and
returned
to
Mrs.
Weston,
that
it
had
not
added
any
lasting
warmth,
that
she
could
still
do
without
the
writer,
and
that
he
must
learn
to
do
without
her.
Her
intentions
were
unchanged.
Her
resolution
of
refusal
only
grew
more
interesting
by
the
addition
of
a
scheme
for
his
subsequent
consolation
and
happiness.
His
recollection
of
Harriet,
and
the
words
which
clothed
it,
the
"beautiful
little
friend,"
suggested
to
her
the
idea
of
Harriet's
succeeding
her
in
his
affections.
Was
it
impossible?
No.
Harriet
undoubtedly
was
greatly
his
inferior
in
understanding;
but
he
had
been
very
much
struck
with
the
loveliness
of
her
face
and
the
warm
simplicity
of
her
manner;
and
all
the
probabilities
of
circumstance
and
connexion
were
in
her
favour.
For
Harriet,
it
would
be
advantageous
and
delightful
indeed.
"I
must
not
dwell
upon
it,"
said
she.
"I
must
not
think
of
it.
I
know
the
danger
of
indulging
such
speculations.
But
stranger
things
have
happened;
and
when
we
cease
to
care
for
each
other
as
we
do
now,
it
will
be
the
means
of
confirming
us
in
that
sort
of
true
disinterested
friendship
which
I
can
already
look
forward
to
with
pleasure."
It
was
well
to
have
a
comfort
in
store
on
Harriet's
behalf,
though
it
might
be
wise
to
let
the
fancy
touch
it
seldom;
for
evil
in
that
quarter
was
at
hand.
As
Frank
Churchill's
arrival
had
succeeded
Mr.
Elton's
engagement
in
the
conversation
of
Highbury,
as
the
latest
interest
had
entirely
borne
down
the
first,
so
now
upon
Frank
Churchill's
disappearance,
Mr.
Elton's
concerns
were
assuming
the
most
irresistible
form.
His
wedding
day
was
named.
He
would
soon
be
among
them
again;
Mr.
Elton
and
his
bride.
There
was
hardly
time
to
talk
over
the
first
letter
from
Enscombe
before
"Mr.
Elton
and
his
bride"
was
in
every
body's
mouth,
and
Frank
Churchill
was
forgotten.
Emma
grew
sick
at
the
sound.
She
had
had
three
weeks
of
happy
exemption
from
Mr.
Elton;
and
Harriet's
mind,
she
had
been
willing
to
hope,
had
been
lately
gaining
strength.
With
Mr.
Weston's
ball
in
view
at
least,
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
