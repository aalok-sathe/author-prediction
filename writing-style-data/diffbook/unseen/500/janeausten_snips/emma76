very
possibly
have
done,
for
Mr.
Woodhouse
would
hardly
have
ventured
had
there
been
much
snow
on
the
ground;
but
now
it
is
of
no
consequence.
This
is
quite
the
season
indeed
for
friendly
meetings.
At
Christmas
every
body
invites
their
friends
about
them,
and
people
think
little
of
even
the
worst
weather.
I
was
snowed
up
at
a
friend's
house
once
for
a
week.
Nothing
could
be
pleasanter.
I
went
for
only
one
night,
and
could
not
get
away
till
that
very
day
se'nnight."
Mr.
John
Knightley
looked
as
if
he
did
not
comprehend
the
pleasure,
but
said
only,
coolly,
"I
cannot
wish
to
be
snowed
up
a
week
at
Randalls."
At
another
time
Emma
might
have
been
amused,
but
she
was
too
much
astonished
now
at
Mr.
Elton's
spirits
for
other
feelings.
Harriet
seemed
quite
forgotten
in
the
expectation
of
a
pleasant
party.
"We
are
sure
of
excellent
fires,"
continued
he,
"and
every
thing
in
the
greatest
comfort.
Charming
people,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston;
Mrs.
Weston
indeed
is
much
beyond
praise,
and
he
is
exactly
what
one
values,
so
hospitable,
and
so
fond
of
society;
it
will
be
a
small
party,
but
where
small
parties
are
select,
they
are
perhaps
the
most
agreeable
of
any.
Mr.
Weston's
dining
room
does
not
accommodate
more
than
ten
comfortably;
and
for
my
part,
I
would
rather,
under
such
circumstances,
fall
short
by
two
than
exceed
by
two.
I
think
you
will
agree
with
me,
(turning
with
a
soft
air
to
Emma,)
I
think
I
shall
certainly
have
your
approbation,
though
Mr.
Knightley
perhaps,
from
being
used
to
the
large
parties
of
London,
may
not
quite
enter
into
our
feelings."
"I
know
nothing
of
the
large
parties
of
London,
sir
I
never
dine
with
any
body."
"Indeed!
(in
a
tone
of
wonder
and
pity,)
I
had
no
idea
that
the
law
had
been
so
great
a
slavery.
Well,
sir,
the
time
must
come
when
you
will
be
paid
for
all
this,
when
you
will
have
little
labour
and
great
enjoyment."
"My
first
enjoyment,"
replied
John
Knightley,
as
they
passed
through
the
sweep
gate,
"will
be
to
find
myself
safe
at
Hartfield
again."
Some
change
of
countenance
was
necessary
for
each
gentleman
as
they
walked
into
Mrs.
Weston's
drawing
room;
Mr.
Elton
must
compose
his
joyous
looks,
and
Mr.
John
Knightley
disperse
his
ill
humour.
Mr.
Elton
must
smile
less,
and
Mr.
John
Knightley
more,
to
fit
them
for
the
place.
Emma
only
might
be
as
nature
prompted,
and
shew
herself
just
as
happy
as
she
was.
To
her
it
was
real
enjoyment
to
be
with
the
Westons.
Mr.
Weston
was
a
great
favourite,
and
there
was
not
a
creature
in
the
world
to
whom
she
spoke
with
such
unreserve,
as
to
his
wife;
not
any
one,
to
whom
she
related
with
such
conviction
of
being
listened
to
and
understood,
of
being
always
interesting
and
always
intelligible,
the
little
affairs,
arrangements,
perplexities,
and
pleasures
of
her
father
and
herself.
She
could
tell
nothing
