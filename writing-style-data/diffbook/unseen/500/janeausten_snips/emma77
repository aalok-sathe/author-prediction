of
Hartfield,
in
which
Mrs.
Weston
had
not
a
lively
concern;
and
half
an
hour's
uninterrupted
communication
of
all
those
little
matters
on
which
the
daily
happiness
of
private
life
depends,
was
one
of
the
first
gratifications
of
each.
This
was
a
pleasure
which
perhaps
the
whole
day's
visit
might
not
afford,
which
certainly
did
not
belong
to
the
present
half
hour;
but
the
very
sight
of
Mrs.
Weston,
her
smile,
her
touch,
her
voice
was
grateful
to
Emma,
and
she
determined
to
think
as
little
as
possible
of
Mr.
Elton's
oddities,
or
of
any
thing
else
unpleasant,
and
enjoy
all
that
was
enjoyable
to
the
utmost.
The
misfortune
of
Harriet's
cold
had
been
pretty
well
gone
through
before
her
arrival.
Mr.
Woodhouse
had
been
safely
seated
long
enough
to
give
the
history
of
it,
besides
all
the
history
of
his
own
and
Isabella's
coming,
and
of
Emma's
being
to
follow,
and
had
indeed
just
got
to
the
end
of
his
satisfaction
that
James
should
come
and
see
his
daughter,
when
the
others
appeared,
and
Mrs.
Weston,
who
had
been
almost
wholly
engrossed
by
her
attentions
to
him,
was
able
to
turn
away
and
welcome
her
dear
Emma.
Emma's
project
of
forgetting
Mr.
Elton
for
a
while
made
her
rather
sorry
to
find,
when
they
had
all
taken
their
places,
that
he
was
close
to
her.
The
difficulty
was
great
of
driving
his
strange
insensibility
towards
Harriet,
from
her
mind,
while
he
not
only
sat
at
her
elbow,
but
was
continually
obtruding
his
happy
countenance
on
her
notice,
and
solicitously
addressing
her
upon
every
occasion.
Instead
of
forgetting
him,
his
behaviour
was
such
that
she
could
not
avoid
the
internal
suggestion
of
"Can
it
really
be
as
my
brother
imagined?
can
it
be
possible
for
this
man
to
be
beginning
to
transfer
his
affections
from
Harriet
to
me?
Absurd
and
insufferable!"
Yet
he
would
be
so
anxious
for
her
being
perfectly
warm,
would
be
so
interested
about
her
father,
and
so
delighted
with
Mrs.
Weston;
and
at
last
would
begin
admiring
her
drawings
with
so
much
zeal
and
so
little
knowledge
as
seemed
terribly
like
a
would
be
lover,
and
made
it
some
effort
with
her
to
preserve
her
good
manners.
For
her
own
sake
she
could
not
be
rude;
and
for
Harriet's,
in
the
hope
that
all
would
yet
turn
out
right,
she
was
even
positively
civil;
but
it
was
an
effort;
especially
as
something
was
going
on
amongst
the
others,
in
the
most
overpowering
period
of
Mr.
Elton's
nonsense,
which
she
particularly
wished
to
listen
to.
She
heard
enough
to
know
that
Mr.
Weston
was
giving
some
information
about
his
son;
she
heard
the
words
"my
son,"
and
"Frank,"
and
"my
son,"
repeated
several
times
over;
and,
from
a
few
other
half
syllables
very
much
suspected
that
he
was
announcing
an
early
visit
from
his
son;
but
before
she
could
quiet
Mr.
Elton,
the
subject
was
so
completely
past
that
any
reviving
question
from
her
would
have
been
