I
care
for
nobody
as
I
do
for
you!
Oh!
Miss
Woodhouse,
how
ungrateful
I
have
been!"
Such
expressions,
assisted
as
they
were
by
every
thing
that
look
and
manner
could
do,
made
Emma
feel
that
she
had
never
loved
Harriet
so
well,
nor
valued
her
affection
so
highly
before.
"There
is
no
charm
equal
to
tenderness
of
heart,"
said
she
afterwards
to
herself.
"There
is
nothing
to
be
compared
to
it.
Warmth
and
tenderness
of
heart,
with
an
affectionate,
open
manner,
will
beat
all
the
clearness
of
head
in
the
world,
for
attraction,
I
am
sure
it
will.
It
is
tenderness
of
heart
which
makes
my
dear
father
so
generally
beloved
which
gives
Isabella
all
her
popularity.
I
have
it
not
but
I
know
how
to
prize
and
respect
it.
Harriet
is
my
superior
in
all
the
charm
and
all
the
felicity
it
gives.
Dear
Harriet!
I
would
not
change
you
for
the
clearest
headed,
longest
sighted,
best
judging
female
breathing.
Oh!
the
coldness
of
a
Jane
Fairfax!
Harriet
is
worth
a
hundred
such
And
for
a
wife
a
sensible
man's
wife
it
is
invaluable.
I
mention
no
names;
but
happy
the
man
who
changes
Emma
for
Harriet!"
Mrs.
Elton
was
first
seen
at
church:
but
though
devotion
might
be
interrupted,
curiosity
could
not
be
satisfied
by
a
bride
in
a
pew,
and
it
must
be
left
for
the
visits
in
form
which
were
then
to
be
paid,
to
settle
whether
she
were
very
pretty
indeed,
or
only
rather
pretty,
or
not
pretty
at
all.
Emma
had
feelings,
less
of
curiosity
than
of
pride
or
propriety,
to
make
her
resolve
on
not
being
the
last
to
pay
her
respects;
and
she
made
a
point
of
Harriet's
going
with
her,
that
the
worst
of
the
business
might
be
gone
through
as
soon
as
possible.
She
could
not
enter
the
house
again,
could
not
be
in
the
same
room
to
which
she
had
with
such
vain
artifice
retreated
three
months
ago,
to
lace
up
her
boot,
without
recollecting.
A
thousand
vexatious
thoughts
would
recur.
Compliments,
charades,
and
horrible
blunders;
and
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
poor
Harriet
should
not
be
recollecting
too;
but
she
behaved
very
well,
and
was
only
rather
pale
and
silent.
The
visit
was
of
course
short;
and
there
was
so
much
embarrassment
and
occupation
of
mind
to
shorten
it,
that
Emma
would
not
allow
herself
entirely
to
form
an
opinion
of
the
lady,
and
on
no
account
to
give
one,
beyond
the
nothing
meaning
terms
of
being
"elegantly
dressed,
and
very
pleasing."
She
did
not
really
like
her.
She
would
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
find
fault,
but
she
suspected
that
there
was
no
elegance;
ease,
but
not
elegance.
She
was
almost
sure
that
for
a
young
woman,
a
stranger,
a
bride,
there
was
too
much
ease.
Her
person
was
rather
good;
her
face
not
unpretty;
but
neither
feature,
nor
air,
nor
voice,
nor
manner,
were
elegant.
Emma
thought
at
least
it
would
turn
