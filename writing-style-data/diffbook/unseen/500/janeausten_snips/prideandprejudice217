to
speak
to
you,"
took
her
out
of
the
room.
Jane
instantly
gave
a
look
at
Elizabeth
which
spoke
her
distress
at
such
premeditation,
and
her
entreaty
that
she
would
not
give
in
to
it.
In
a
few
minutes,
Mrs.
Bennet
half
opened
the
door
and
called
out:
"Lizzy,
my
dear,
I
want
to
speak
with
you."
Elizabeth
was
forced
to
go.
"We
may
as
well
leave
them
by
themselves
you
know;"
said
her
mother,
as
soon
as
she
was
in
the
hall.
"Kitty
and
I
are
going
up
stairs
to
sit
in
my
dressing
room."
Elizabeth
made
no
attempt
to
reason
with
her
mother,
but
remained
quietly
in
the
hall,
till
she
and
Kitty
were
out
of
sight,
then
returned
into
the
drawing
room.
Mrs.
Bennet's
schemes
for
this
day
were
ineffectual.
Bingley
was
every
thing
that
was
charming,
except
the
professed
lover
of
her
daughter.
His
ease
and
cheerfulness
rendered
him
a
most
agreeable
addition
to
their
evening
party;
and
he
bore
with
the
ill
judged
officiousness
of
the
mother,
and
heard
all
her
silly
remarks
with
a
forbearance
and
command
of
countenance
particularly
grateful
to
the
daughter.
He
scarcely
needed
an
invitation
to
stay
supper;
and
before
he
went
away,
an
engagement
was
formed,
chiefly
through
his
own
and
Mrs.
Bennet's
means,
for
his
coming
next
morning
to
shoot
with
her
husband.
After
this
day,
Jane
said
no
more
of
her
indifference.
Not
a
word
passed
between
the
sisters
concerning
Bingley;
but
Elizabeth
went
to
bed
in
the
happy
belief
that
all
must
speedily
be
concluded,
unless
Mr.
Darcy
returned
within
the
stated
time.
Seriously,
however,
she
felt
tolerably
persuaded
that
all
this
must
have
taken
place
with
that
gentleman's
concurrence.
Bingley
was
punctual
to
his
appointment;
and
he
and
Mr.
Bennet
spent
the
morning
together,
as
had
been
agreed
on.
The
latter
was
much
more
agreeable
than
his
companion
expected.
There
was
nothing
of
presumption
or
folly
in
Bingley
that
could
provoke
his
ridicule,
or
disgust
him
into
silence;
and
he
was
more
communicative,
and
less
eccentric,
than
the
other
had
ever
seen
him.
Bingley
of
course
returned
with
him
to
dinner;
and
in
the
evening
Mrs.
Bennet's
invention
was
again
at
work
to
get
every
body
away
from
him
and
her
daughter.
Elizabeth,
who
had
a
letter
to
write,
went
into
the
breakfast
room
for
that
purpose
soon
after
tea;
for
as
the
others
were
all
going
to
sit
down
to
cards,
she
could
not
be
wanted
to
counteract
her
mother's
schemes.
But
on
returning
to
the
drawing
room,
when
her
letter
was
finished,
she
saw,
to
her
infinite
surprise,
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
her
mother
had
been
too
ingenious
for
her.
On
opening
the
door,
she
perceived
her
sister
and
Bingley
standing
together
over
the
hearth,
as
if
engaged
in
earnest
conversation;
and
had
this
led
to
no
suspicion,
the
faces
of
both,
as
they
hastily
turned
round
and
moved
away
from
each
other,
would
have
told
it
all.
Their
situation
was
