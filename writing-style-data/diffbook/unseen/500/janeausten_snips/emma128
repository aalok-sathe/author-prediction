of
the
street,
and
there
are
a
great
many
houses;
you
might
be
very
much
at
a
loss,
and
it
is
a
very
dirty
walk,
unless
you
keep
on
the
footpath;
but
my
coachman
can
tell
you
where
you
had
best
cross
the
street."
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
still
declined
it,
looking
as
serious
as
he
could,
and
his
father
gave
his
hearty
support
by
calling
out,
"My
good
friend,
this
is
quite
unnecessary;
Frank
knows
a
puddle
of
water
when
he
sees
it,
and
as
to
Mrs.
Bates's,
he
may
get
there
from
the
Crown
in
a
hop,
step,
and
jump."
They
were
permitted
to
go
alone;
and
with
a
cordial
nod
from
one,
and
a
graceful
bow
from
the
other,
the
two
gentlemen
took
leave.
Emma
remained
very
well
pleased
with
this
beginning
of
the
acquaintance,
and
could
now
engage
to
think
of
them
all
at
Randalls
any
hour
of
the
day,
with
full
confidence
in
their
comfort.
The
next
morning
brought
Mr.
Frank
Churchill
again.
He
came
with
Mrs.
Weston,
to
whom
and
to
Highbury
he
seemed
to
take
very
cordially.
He
had
been
sitting
with
her,
it
appeared,
most
companionably
at
home,
till
her
usual
hour
of
exercise;
and
on
being
desired
to
chuse
their
walk,
immediately
fixed
on
Highbury.
"He
did
not
doubt
there
being
very
pleasant
walks
in
every
direction,
but
if
left
to
him,
he
should
always
chuse
the
same.
Highbury,
that
airy,
cheerful,
happy
looking
Highbury,
would
be
his
constant
attraction."
Highbury,
with
Mrs.
Weston,
stood
for
Hartfield;
and
she
trusted
to
its
bearing
the
same
construction
with
him.
They
walked
thither
directly.
Emma
had
hardly
expected
them:
for
Mr.
Weston,
who
had
called
in
for
half
a
minute,
in
order
to
hear
that
his
son
was
very
handsome,
knew
nothing
of
their
plans;
and
it
was
an
agreeable
surprize
to
her,
therefore,
to
perceive
them
walking
up
to
the
house
together,
arm
in
arm.
She
was
wanting
to
see
him
again,
and
especially
to
see
him
in
company
with
Mrs.
Weston,
upon
his
behaviour
to
whom
her
opinion
of
him
was
to
depend.
If
he
were
deficient
there,
nothing
should
make
amends
for
it.
But
on
seeing
them
together,
she
became
perfectly
satisfied.
It
was
not
merely
in
fine
words
or
hyperbolical
compliment
that
he
paid
his
duty;
nothing
could
be
more
proper
or
pleasing
than
his
whole
manner
to
her
nothing
could
more
agreeably
denote
his
wish
of
considering
her
as
a
friend
and
securing
her
affection.
And
there
was
time
enough
for
Emma
to
form
a
reasonable
judgment,
as
their
visit
included
all
the
rest
of
the
morning.
They
were
all
three
walking
about
together
for
an
hour
or
two
first
round
the
shrubberies
of
Hartfield,
and
afterwards
in
Highbury.
He
was
delighted
with
every
thing;
admired
Hartfield
sufficiently
for
Mr.
Woodhouse's
ear;
and
when
their
going
farther
was
resolved
on,
confessed
his
wish
to
be
made
acquainted
with
the
whole
village,
and
found
matter
of
commendation
and
interest
much
