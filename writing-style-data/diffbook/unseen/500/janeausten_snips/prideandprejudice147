direction,
may
be
of
service,
if
not
to
himself,
to
many
others,
for
it
must
only
deter
him
from
such
foul
misconduct
as
I
have
suffered
by.
I
only
fear
that
the
sort
of
cautiousness
to
which
you,
I
imagine,
have
been
alluding,
is
merely
adopted
on
his
visits
to
his
aunt,
of
whose
good
opinion
and
judgement
he
stands
much
in
awe.
His
fear
of
her
has
always
operated,
I
know,
when
they
were
together;
and
a
good
deal
is
to
be
imputed
to
his
wish
of
forwarding
the
match
with
Miss
de
Bourgh,
which
I
am
certain
he
has
very
much
at
heart."
Elizabeth
could
not
repress
a
smile
at
this,
but
she
answered
only
by
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head.
She
saw
that
he
wanted
to
engage
her
on
the
old
subject
of
his
grievances,
and
she
was
in
no
humour
to
indulge
him.
The
rest
of
the
evening
passed
with
the
appearance,
on
his
side,
of
usual
cheerfulness,
but
with
no
further
attempt
to
distinguish
Elizabeth;
and
they
parted
at
last
with
mutual
civility,
and
possibly
a
mutual
desire
of
never
meeting
again.
When
the
party
broke
up,
Lydia
returned
with
Mrs.
Forster
to
Meryton,
from
whence
they
were
to
set
out
early
the
next
morning.
The
separation
between
her
and
her
family
was
rather
noisy
than
pathetic.
Kitty
was
the
only
one
who
shed
tears;
but
she
did
weep
from
vexation
and
envy.
Mrs.
Bennet
was
diffuse
in
her
good
wishes
for
the
felicity
of
her
daughter,
and
impressive
in
her
injunctions
that
she
should
not
miss
the
opportunity
of
enjoying
herself
as
much
as
possible
advice
which
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
would
be
well
attended
to;
and
in
the
clamorous
happiness
of
Lydia
herself
in
bidding
farewell,
the
more
gentle
adieus
of
her
sisters
were
uttered
without
being
heard.
Had
Elizabeth's
opinion
been
all
drawn
from
her
own
family,
she
could
not
have
formed
a
very
pleasing
opinion
of
conjugal
felicity
or
domestic
comfort.
Her
father,
captivated
by
youth
and
beauty,
and
that
appearance
of
good
humour
which
youth
and
beauty
generally
give,
had
married
a
woman
whose
weak
understanding
and
illiberal
mind
had
very
early
in
their
marriage
put
an
end
to
all
real
affection
for
her.
Respect,
esteem,
and
confidence
had
vanished
for
ever;
and
all
his
views
of
domestic
happiness
were
overthrown.
But
Mr.
Bennet
was
not
of
a
disposition
to
seek
comfort
for
the
disappointment
which
his
own
imprudence
had
brought
on,
in
any
of
those
pleasures
which
too
often
console
the
unfortunate
for
their
folly
or
their
vice.
He
was
fond
of
the
country
and
of
books;
and
from
these
tastes
had
arisen
his
principal
enjoyments.
To
his
wife
he
was
very
little
otherwise
indebted,
than
as
her
ignorance
and
folly
had
contributed
to
his
amusement.
This
is
not
the
sort
of
happiness
which
a
man
would
in
general
wish
to
owe
to
his
wife;
but
where
other
powers
of
entertainment
are
wanting,
the
true
philosopher
