you
shall
put
her
and
what
room
there
will
be
for
the
children?"
"Oh!
yes
she
will
have
her
own
room,
of
course;
the
room
she
always
has;
and
there
is
the
nursery
for
the
children,
just
as
usual,
you
know.
Why
should
there
be
any
change?"
"I
do
not
know,
my
dear
but
it
is
so
long
since
she
was
here!
not
since
last
Easter,
and
then
only
for
a
few
days.
Mr.
John
Knightley's
being
a
lawyer
is
very
inconvenient.
Poor
Isabella!
she
is
sadly
taken
away
from
us
all!
and
how
sorry
she
will
be
when
she
comes,
not
to
see
Miss
Taylor
here!"
"She
will
not
be
surprized,
papa,
at
least."
"I
do
not
know,
my
dear.
I
am
sure
I
was
very
much
surprized
when
I
first
heard
she
was
going
to
be
married."
"We
must
ask
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Weston
to
dine
with
us,
while
Isabella
is
here."
"Yes,
my
dear,
if
there
is
time.
But
(in
a
very
depressed
tone)
she
is
coming
for
only
one
week.
There
will
not
be
time
for
any
thing."
"It
is
unfortunate
that
they
cannot
stay
longer
but
it
seems
a
case
of
necessity.
Mr.
John
Knightley
must
be
in
town
again
on
the
28th,
and
we
ought
to
be
thankful,
papa,
that
we
are
to
have
the
whole
of
the
time
they
can
give
to
the
country,
that
two
or
three
days
are
not
to
be
taken
out
for
the
Abbey.
Mr.
Knightley
promises
to
give
up
his
claim
this
Christmas
though
you
know
it
is
longer
since
they
were
with
him,
than
with
us."
"It
would
be
very
hard,
indeed,
my
dear,
if
poor
Isabella
were
to
be
anywhere
but
at
Hartfield."
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
never
allow
for
Mr.
Knightley's
claims
on
his
brother,
or
any
body's
claims
on
Isabella,
except
his
own.
He
sat
musing
a
little
while,
and
then
said,
"But
I
do
not
see
why
poor
Isabella
should
be
obliged
to
go
back
so
soon,
though
he
does.
I
think,
Emma,
I
shall
try
and
persuade
her
to
stay
longer
with
us.
She
and
the
children
might
stay
very
well."
"Ah!
papa
that
is
what
you
never
have
been
able
to
accomplish,
and
I
do
not
think
you
ever
will.
Isabella
cannot
bear
to
stay
behind
her
husband."
This
was
too
true
for
contradiction.
Unwelcome
as
it
was,
Mr.
Woodhouse
could
only
give
a
submissive
sigh;
and
as
Emma
saw
his
spirits
affected
by
the
idea
of
his
daughter's
attachment
to
her
husband,
she
immediately
led
to
such
a
branch
of
the
subject
as
must
raise
them.
"Harriet
must
give
us
as
much
of
her
company
as
she
can
while
my
brother
and
sister
are
here.
I
am
sure
she
will
be
pleased
with
the
children.
We
are
very
proud
of
the
children,
are
not
we,
papa?
I
wonder
which
she
will
think
the
handsomest,
Henry
or
John?"
"Aye,
I
wonder
which
she
will.
Poor
little
dears,
how
glad
they
will
be
