her
thoroughly
yourself.
No
description
can
describe
her.
She
must
tell
you
herself
what
she
is
yet
not
by
word,
for
never
was
there
a
human
creature
who
would
so
designedly
suppress
her
own
merit.
Since
I
began
this
letter,
which
will
be
longer
than
I
foresaw,
I
have
heard
from
her.
She
gives
a
good
account
of
her
own
health;
but
as
she
never
complains,
I
dare
not
depend.
I
want
to
have
your
opinion
of
her
looks.
I
know
you
will
soon
call
on
her;
she
is
living
in
dread
of
the
visit.
Perhaps
it
is
paid
already.
Let
me
hear
from
you
without
delay;
I
am
impatient
for
a
thousand
particulars.
Remember
how
few
minutes
I
was
at
Randalls,
and
in
how
bewildered,
how
mad
a
state:
and
I
am
not
much
better
yet;
still
insane
either
from
happiness
or
misery.
When
I
think
of
the
kindness
and
favour
I
have
met
with,
of
her
excellence
and
patience,
and
my
uncle's
generosity,
I
am
mad
with
joy:
but
when
I
recollect
all
the
uneasiness
I
occasioned
her,
and
how
little
I
deserve
to
be
forgiven,
I
am
mad
with
anger.
If
I
could
but
see
her
again!
But
I
must
not
propose
it
yet.
My
uncle
has
been
too
good
for
me
to
encroach.
I
must
still
add
to
this
long
letter.
You
have
not
heard
all
that
you
ought
to
hear.
I
could
not
give
any
connected
detail
yesterday;
but
the
suddenness,
and,
in
one
light,
the
unseasonableness
with
which
the
affair
burst
out,
needs
explanation;
for
though
the
event
of
the
26th
ult.,
as
you
will
conclude,
immediately
opened
to
me
the
happiest
prospects,
I
should
not
have
presumed
on
such
early
measures,
but
from
the
very
particular
circumstances,
which
left
me
not
an
hour
to
lose.
I
should
myself
have
shrunk
from
any
thing
so
hasty,
and
she
would
have
felt
every
scruple
of
mine
with
multiplied
strength
and
refinement.
But
I
had
no
choice.
The
hasty
engagement
she
had
entered
into
with
that
woman
Here,
my
dear
madam,
I
was
obliged
to
leave
off
abruptly,
to
recollect
and
compose
myself.
I
have
been
walking
over
the
country,
and
am
now,
I
hope,
rational
enough
to
make
the
rest
of
my
letter
what
it
ought
to
be.
It
is,
in
fact,
a
most
mortifying
retrospect
for
me.
I
behaved
shamefully.
And
here
I
can
admit,
that
my
manners
to
Miss
W.,
in
being
unpleasant
to
Miss
F.,
were
highly
blameable.
She
disapproved
them,
which
ought
to
have
been
enough.
My
plea
of
concealing
the
truth
she
did
not
think
sufficient.
She
was
displeased;
I
thought
unreasonably
so:
I
thought
her,
on
a
thousand
occasions,
unnecessarily
scrupulous
and
cautious:
I
thought
her
even
cold.
But
she
was
always
right.
If
I
had
followed
her
judgment,
and
subdued
my
spirits
to
the
level
of
what
she
deemed
proper,
I
should
have
escaped
the
greatest
unhappiness
I
have
ever
known.
We
quarrelled.
Do
you
remember
the
morning
