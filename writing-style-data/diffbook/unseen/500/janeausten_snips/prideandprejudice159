the
rest
of
the
party
with
whom
he
had
been
travelling.
"They
will
join
me
early
to
morrow,"
he
continued,
"and
among
them
are
some
who
will
claim
an
acquaintance
with
you
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
sisters."
Elizabeth
answered
only
by
a
slight
bow.
Her
thoughts
were
instantly
driven
back
to
the
time
when
Mr.
Bingley's
name
had
been
the
last
mentioned
between
them;
and,
if
she
might
judge
by
his
complexion,
his
mind
was
not
very
differently
engaged.
"There
is
also
one
other
person
in
the
party,"
he
continued
after
a
pause,
"who
more
particularly
wishes
to
be
known
to
you.
Will
you
allow
me,
or
do
I
ask
too
much,
to
introduce
my
sister
to
your
acquaintance
during
your
stay
at
Lambton?"
The
surprise
of
such
an
application
was
great
indeed;
it
was
too
great
for
her
to
know
in
what
manner
she
acceded
to
it.
She
immediately
felt
that
whatever
desire
Miss
Darcy
might
have
of
being
acquainted
with
her
must
be
the
work
of
her
brother,
and,
without
looking
farther,
it
was
satisfactory;
it
was
gratifying
to
know
that
his
resentment
had
not
made
him
think
really
ill
of
her.
They
now
walked
on
in
silence,
each
of
them
deep
in
thought.
Elizabeth
was
not
comfortable;
that
was
impossible;
but
she
was
flattered
and
pleased.
His
wish
of
introducing
his
sister
to
her
was
a
compliment
of
the
highest
kind.
They
soon
outstripped
the
others,
and
when
they
had
reached
the
carriage,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
were
half
a
quarter
of
a
mile
behind.
He
then
asked
her
to
walk
into
the
house
but
she
declared
herself
not
tired,
and
they
stood
together
on
the
lawn.
At
such
a
time
much
might
have
been
said,
and
silence
was
very
awkward.
She
wanted
to
talk,
but
there
seemed
to
be
an
embargo
on
every
subject.
At
last
she
recollected
that
she
had
been
travelling,
and
they
talked
of
Matlock
and
Dove
Dale
with
great
perseverance.
Yet
time
and
her
aunt
moved
slowly
and
her
patience
and
her
ideas
were
nearly
worn
out
before
the
tete
a
tete
was
over.
On
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner's
coming
up
they
were
all
pressed
to
go
into
the
house
and
take
some
refreshment;
but
this
was
declined,
and
they
parted
on
each
side
with
utmost
politeness.
Mr.
Darcy
handed
the
ladies
into
the
carriage;
and
when
it
drove
off,
Elizabeth
saw
him
walking
slowly
towards
the
house.
The
observations
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
now
began;
and
each
of
them
pronounced
him
to
be
infinitely
superior
to
anything
they
had
expected.
"He
is
perfectly
well
behaved,
polite,
and
unassuming,"
said
her
uncle.
"There
is
something
a
little
stately
in
him,
to
be
sure,"
replied
her
aunt,
"but
it
is
confined
to
his
air,
and
is
not
unbecoming.
I
can
now
say
with
the
housekeeper,
that
though
some
people
may
call
him
proud,
I
have
seen
nothing
of
it."
"I
was
never
more
surprised
than
by
his
behaviour
to
us.
It
was
