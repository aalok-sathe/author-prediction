to
their
expenses
of
every
sort;
and
by
this
time
were,
in
fortune
and
style
of
living,
second
only
to
the
family
at
Hartfield.
Their
love
of
society,
and
their
new
dining
room,
prepared
every
body
for
their
keeping
dinner
company;
and
a
few
parties,
chiefly
among
the
single
men,
had
already
taken
place.
The
regular
and
best
families
Emma
could
hardly
suppose
they
would
presume
to
invite
neither
Donwell,
nor
Hartfield,
nor
Randalls.
Nothing
should
tempt
her
to
go,
if
they
did;
and
she
regretted
that
her
father's
known
habits
would
be
giving
her
refusal
less
meaning
than
she
could
wish.
The
Coles
were
very
respectable
in
their
way,
but
they
ought
to
be
taught
that
it
was
not
for
them
to
arrange
the
terms
on
which
the
superior
families
would
visit
them.
This
lesson,
she
very
much
feared,
they
would
receive
only
from
herself;
she
had
little
hope
of
Mr.
Knightley,
none
of
Mr.
Weston.
But
she
had
made
up
her
mind
how
to
meet
this
presumption
so
many
weeks
before
it
appeared,
that
when
the
insult
came
at
last,
it
found
her
very
differently
affected.
Donwell
and
Randalls
had
received
their
invitation,
and
none
had
come
for
her
father
and
herself;
and
Mrs.
Weston's
accounting
for
it
with
"I
suppose
they
will
not
take
the
liberty
with
you;
they
know
you
do
not
dine
out,"
was
not
quite
sufficient.
She
felt
that
she
should
like
to
have
had
the
power
of
refusal;
and
afterwards,
as
the
idea
of
the
party
to
be
assembled
there,
consisting
precisely
of
those
whose
society
was
dearest
to
her,
occurred
again
and
again,
she
did
not
know
that
she
might
not
have
been
tempted
to
accept.
Harriet
was
to
be
there
in
the
evening,
and
the
Bateses.
They
had
been
speaking
of
it
as
they
walked
about
Highbury
the
day
before,
and
Frank
Churchill
had
most
earnestly
lamented
her
absence.
Might
not
the
evening
end
in
a
dance?
had
been
a
question
of
his.
The
bare
possibility
of
it
acted
as
a
farther
irritation
on
her
spirits;
and
her
being
left
in
solitary
grandeur,
even
supposing
the
omission
to
be
intended
as
a
compliment,
was
but
poor
comfort.
It
was
the
arrival
of
this
very
invitation
while
the
Westons
were
at
Hartfield,
which
made
their
presence
so
acceptable;
for
though
her
first
remark,
on
reading
it,
was
that
"of
course
it
must
be
declined,"
she
so
very
soon
proceeded
to
ask
them
what
they
advised
her
to
do,
that
their
advice
for
her
going
was
most
prompt
and
successful.
She
owned
that,
considering
every
thing,
she
was
not
absolutely
without
inclination
for
the
party.
The
Coles
expressed
themselves
so
properly
there
was
so
much
real
attention
in
the
manner
of
it
so
much
consideration
for
her
father.
"They
would
have
solicited
the
honour
earlier,
but
had
been
waiting
the
arrival
of
a
folding
screen
from
London,
which
they
hoped
might
keep
Mr.
Woodhouse
from
any
draught
of
air,
and
therefore
induce
him
