of
your
own
attachment
to
Hertfordshire.
Anything
beyond
the
very
neighbourhood
of
Longbourn,
I
suppose,
would
appear
far."
As
he
spoke
there
was
a
sort
of
smile
which
Elizabeth
fancied
she
understood;
he
must
be
supposing
her
to
be
thinking
of
Jane
and
Netherfield,
and
she
blushed
as
she
answered:
"I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
a
woman
may
not
be
settled
too
near
her
family.
The
far
and
the
near
must
be
relative,
and
depend
on
many
varying
circumstances.
Where
there
is
fortune
to
make
the
expenses
of
travelling
unimportant,
distance
becomes
no
evil.
But
that
is
not
the
case
here.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Collins
have
a
comfortable
income,
but
not
such
a
one
as
will
allow
of
frequent
journeys
and
I
am
persuaded
my
friend
would
not
call
herself
near
her
family
under
less
than
half
the
present
distance."
Mr.
Darcy
drew
his
chair
a
little
towards
her,
and
said,
"You
cannot
have
a
right
to
such
very
strong
local
attachment.
You
cannot
have
been
always
at
Longbourn."
Elizabeth
looked
surprised.
The
gentleman
experienced
some
change
of
feeling;
he
drew
back
his
chair,
took
a
newspaper
from
the
table,
and
glancing
over
it,
said,
in
a
colder
voice:
"Are
you
pleased
with
Kent?"
A
short
dialogue
on
the
subject
of
the
country
ensued,
on
either
side
calm
and
concise
and
soon
put
an
end
to
by
the
entrance
of
Charlotte
and
her
sister,
just
returned
from
her
walk.
The
tete
a
tete
surprised
them.
Mr.
Darcy
related
the
mistake
which
had
occasioned
his
intruding
on
Miss
Bennet,
and
after
sitting
a
few
minutes
longer
without
saying
much
to
anybody,
went
away.
"What
can
be
the
meaning
of
this?"
said
Charlotte,
as
soon
as
he
was
gone.
"My
dear,
Eliza,
he
must
be
in
love
with
you,
or
he
would
never
have
called
us
in
this
familiar
way."
But
when
Elizabeth
told
of
his
silence,
it
did
not
seem
very
likely,
even
to
Charlotte's
wishes,
to
be
the
case;
and
after
various
conjectures,
they
could
at
last
only
suppose
his
visit
to
proceed
from
the
difficulty
of
finding
anything
to
do,
which
was
the
more
probable
from
the
time
of
year.
All
field
sports
were
over.
Within
doors
there
was
Lady
Catherine,
books,
and
a
billiard
table,
but
gentlemen
cannot
always
be
within
doors;
and
in
the
nearness
of
the
Parsonage,
or
the
pleasantness
of
the
walk
to
it,
or
of
the
people
who
lived
in
it,
the
two
cousins
found
a
temptation
from
this
period
of
walking
thither
almost
every
day.
They
called
at
various
times
of
the
morning,
sometimes
separately,
sometimes
together,
and
now
and
then
accompanied
by
their
aunt.
It
was
plain
to
them
all
that
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
came
because
he
had
pleasure
in
their
society,
a
persuasion
which
of
course
recommended
him
still
more;
and
Elizabeth
was
reminded
by
her
own
satisfaction
in
being
with
him,
as
well
as
by
his
evident
admiration
of
her,
of
her
former
favourite
George
Wickham;
and
though,
in
