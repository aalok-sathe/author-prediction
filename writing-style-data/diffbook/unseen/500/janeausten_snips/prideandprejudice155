him
by
Mrs.
Reynolds
was
of
no
trifling
nature.
What
praise
is
more
valuable
than
the
praise
of
an
intelligent
servant?
As
a
brother,
a
landlord,
a
master,
she
considered
how
many
people's
happiness
were
in
his
guardianship!
how
much
of
pleasure
or
pain
was
it
in
his
power
to
bestow!
how
much
of
good
or
evil
must
be
done
by
him!
Every
idea
that
had
been
brought
forward
by
the
housekeeper
was
favourable
to
his
character,
and
as
she
stood
before
the
canvas
on
which
he
was
represented,
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
herself,
she
thought
of
his
regard
with
a
deeper
sentiment
of
gratitude
than
it
had
ever
raised
before;
she
remembered
its
warmth,
and
softened
its
impropriety
of
expression.
When
all
of
the
house
that
was
open
to
general
inspection
had
been
seen,
they
returned
downstairs,
and,
taking
leave
of
the
housekeeper,
were
consigned
over
to
the
gardener,
who
met
them
at
the
hall
door.
As
they
walked
across
the
hall
towards
the
river,
Elizabeth
turned
back
to
look
again;
her
uncle
and
aunt
stopped
also,
and
while
the
former
was
conjecturing
as
to
the
date
of
the
building,
the
owner
of
it
himself
suddenly
came
forward
from
the
road,
which
led
behind
it
to
the
stables.
They
were
within
twenty
yards
of
each
other,
and
so
abrupt
was
his
appearance,
that
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
his
sight.
Their
eyes
instantly
met,
and
the
cheeks
of
both
were
overspread
with
the
deepest
blush.
He
absolutely
started,
and
for
a
moment
seemed
immovable
from
surprise;
but
shortly
recovering
himself,
advanced
towards
the
party,
and
spoke
to
Elizabeth,
if
not
in
terms
of
perfect
composure,
at
least
of
perfect
civility.
She
had
instinctively
turned
away;
but
stopping
on
his
approach,
received
his
compliments
with
an
embarrassment
impossible
to
be
overcome.
Had
his
first
appearance,
or
his
resemblance
to
the
picture
they
had
just
been
examining,
been
insufficient
to
assure
the
other
two
that
they
now
saw
Mr.
Darcy,
the
gardener's
expression
of
surprise,
on
beholding
his
master,
must
immediately
have
told
it.
They
stood
a
little
aloof
while
he
was
talking
to
their
niece,
who,
astonished
and
confused,
scarcely
dared
lift
her
eyes
to
his
face,
and
knew
not
what
answer
she
returned
to
his
civil
inquiries
after
her
family.
Amazed
at
the
alteration
of
his
manner
since
they
last
parted,
every
sentence
that
he
uttered
was
increasing
her
embarrassment;
and
every
idea
of
the
impropriety
of
her
being
found
there
recurring
to
her
mind,
the
few
minutes
in
which
they
continued
were
some
of
the
most
uncomfortable
in
her
life.
Nor
did
he
seem
much
more
at
ease;
when
he
spoke,
his
accent
had
none
of
its
usual
sedateness;
and
he
repeated
his
inquiries
as
to
the
time
of
her
having
left
Longbourn,
and
of
her
having
stayed
in
Derbyshire,
so
often,
and
in
so
hurried
a
way,
as
plainly
spoke
the
distraction
of
his
thoughts.
At
length
every
idea
seemed
to
fail
him;
and,
after
standing
