you;
and
I
am
sure
nobody
else
will
believe
me,
if
you
do
not.
Yet,
indeed,
I
am
in
earnest.
I
speak
nothing
but
the
truth.
He
still
loves
me,
and
we
are
engaged."
Jane
looked
at
her
doubtingly.
"Oh,
Lizzy!
it
cannot
be.
I
know
how
much
you
dislike
him."
"You
know
nothing
of
the
matter.
That
is
all
to
be
forgot.
Perhaps
I
did
not
always
love
him
so
well
as
I
do
now.
But
in
such
cases
as
these,
a
good
memory
is
unpardonable.
This
is
the
last
time
I
shall
ever
remember
it
myself."
Miss
Bennet
still
looked
all
amazement.
Elizabeth
again,
and
more
seriously
assured
her
of
its
truth.
"Good
Heaven!
can
it
be
really
so!
Yet
now
I
must
believe
you,"
cried
Jane.
"My
dear,
dear
Lizzy,
I
would
I
do
congratulate
you
but
are
you
certain?
forgive
the
question
are
you
quite
certain
that
you
can
be
happy
with
him?"
"There
can
be
no
doubt
of
that.
It
is
settled
between
us
already,
that
we
are
to
be
the
happiest
couple
in
the
world.
But
are
you
pleased,
Jane?
Shall
you
like
to
have
such
a
brother?"
"Very,
very
much.
Nothing
could
give
either
Bingley
or
myself
more
delight.
But
we
considered
it,
we
talked
of
it
as
impossible.
And
do
you
really
love
him
quite
well
enough?
Oh,
Lizzy!
do
anything
rather
than
marry
without
affection.
Are
you
quite
sure
that
you
feel
what
you
ought
to
do?"
"Oh,
yes!
You
will
only
think
I
feel
more
than
I
ought
to
do,
when
I
tell
you
all."
"What
do
you
mean?"
"Why,
I
must
confess
that
I
love
him
better
than
I
do
Bingley.
I
am
afraid
you
will
be
angry."
"My
dearest
sister,
now
be
serious.
I
want
to
talk
very
seriously.
Let
me
know
every
thing
that
I
am
to
know,
without
delay.
Will
you
tell
me
how
long
you
have
loved
him?"
"It
has
been
coming
on
so
gradually,
that
I
hardly
know
when
it
began.
But
I
believe
I
must
date
it
from
my
first
seeing
his
beautiful
grounds
at
Pemberley."
Another
entreaty
that
she
would
be
serious,
however,
produced
the
desired
effect;
and
she
soon
satisfied
Jane
by
her
solemn
assurances
of
attachment.
When
convinced
on
that
article,
Miss
Bennet
had
nothing
further
to
wish.
"Now
I
am
quite
happy,"
said
she,
"for
you
will
be
as
happy
as
myself.
I
always
had
a
value
for
him.
Were
it
for
nothing
but
his
love
of
you,
I
must
always
have
esteemed
him;
but
now,
as
Bingley's
friend
and
your
husband,
there
can
be
only
Bingley
and
yourself
more
dear
to
me.
But
Lizzy,
you
have
been
very
sly,
very
reserved
with
me.
How
little
did
you
tell
me
of
what
passed
at
Pemberley
and
Lambton!
I
owe
all
that
I
know
of
it
to
another,
not
to
you."
Elizabeth
told
her
the
motives
of
her
secrecy.
She
had
been
unwilling
to
mention
Bingley;
and
the
unsettled
state
