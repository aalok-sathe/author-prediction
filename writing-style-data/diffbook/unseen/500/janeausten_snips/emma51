me
read
it
to
him."
Harriet
looked
grave.
"My
dear
Harriet,
you
must
not
refine
too
much
upon
this
charade.
You
will
betray
your
feelings
improperly,
if
you
are
too
conscious
and
too
quick,
and
appear
to
affix
more
meaning,
or
even
quite
all
the
meaning
which
may
be
affixed
to
it.
Do
not
be
overpowered
by
such
a
little
tribute
of
admiration.
If
he
had
been
anxious
for
secrecy,
he
would
not
have
left
the
paper
while
I
was
by;
but
he
rather
pushed
it
towards
me
than
towards
you.
Do
not
let
us
be
too
solemn
on
the
business.
He
has
encouragement
enough
to
proceed,
without
our
sighing
out
our
souls
over
this
charade."
"Oh!
no
I
hope
I
shall
not
be
ridiculous
about
it.
Do
as
you
please."
Mr.
Woodhouse
came
in,
and
very
soon
led
to
the
subject
again,
by
the
recurrence
of
his
very
frequent
inquiry
of
"Well,
my
dears,
how
does
your
book
go
on?
Have
you
got
any
thing
fresh?"
"Yes,
papa;
we
have
something
to
read
you,
something
quite
fresh.
A
piece
of
paper
was
found
on
the
table
this
morning
(dropt,
we
suppose,
by
a
fairy)
containing
a
very
pretty
charade,
and
we
have
just
copied
it
in."
She
read
it
to
him,
just
as
he
liked
to
have
any
thing
read,
slowly
and
distinctly,
and
two
or
three
times
over,
with
explanations
of
every
part
as
she
proceeded
and
he
was
very
much
pleased,
and,
as
she
had
foreseen,
especially
struck
with
the
complimentary
conclusion.
"Aye,
that's
very
just,
indeed,
that's
very
properly
said.
Very
true.
'Woman,
lovely
woman.'
It
is
such
a
pretty
charade,
my
dear,
that
I
can
easily
guess
what
fairy
brought
it.
Nobody
could
have
written
so
prettily,
but
you,
Emma."
Emma
only
nodded,
and
smiled.
After
a
little
thinking,
and
a
very
tender
sigh,
he
added,
"Ah!
it
is
no
difficulty
to
see
who
you
take
after!
Your
dear
mother
was
so
clever
at
all
those
things!
If
I
had
but
her
memory!
But
I
can
remember
nothing;
not
even
that
particular
riddle
which
you
have
heard
me
mention;
I
can
only
recollect
the
first
stanza;
and
there
are
several.
Kitty,
a
fair
but
frozen
maid,
Kindled
a
flame
I
yet
deplore,
The
hood
wink'd
boy
I
called
to
aid,
Though
of
his
near
approach
afraid,
So
fatal
to
my
suit
before.
And
that
is
all
that
I
can
recollect
of
it
but
it
is
very
clever
all
the
way
through.
But
I
think,
my
dear,
you
said
you
had
got
it."
"Yes,
papa,
it
is
written
out
in
our
second
page.
We
copied
it
from
the
Elegant
Extracts.
It
was
Garrick's,
you
know."
"Aye,
very
true.
I
wish
I
could
recollect
more
of
it.
Kitty,
a
fair
but
frozen
maid.
The
name
makes
me
think
of
poor
Isabella;
for
she
was
very
near
being
christened
Catherine
after
her
grandmama.
I
hope
we
shall
have
her
here
next
week.
Have
you
thought,
my
dear,
where
