at
Netherfield
only
a
twelvemonth.
So
near
a
vicinity
to
her
mother
and
Meryton
relations
was
not
desirable
even
to
his
easy
temper,
or
her
affectionate
heart.
The
darling
wish
of
his
sisters
was
then
gratified;
he
bought
an
estate
in
a
neighbouring
county
to
Derbyshire,
and
Jane
and
Elizabeth,
in
addition
to
every
other
source
of
happiness,
were
within
thirty
miles
of
each
other.
Kitty,
to
her
very
material
advantage,
spent
the
chief
of
her
time
with
her
two
elder
sisters.
In
society
so
superior
to
what
she
had
generally
known,
her
improvement
was
great.
She
was
not
of
so
ungovernable
a
temper
as
Lydia;
and,
removed
from
the
influence
of
Lydia's
example,
she
became,
by
proper
attention
and
management,
less
irritable,
less
ignorant,
and
less
insipid.
From
the
further
disadvantage
of
Lydia's
society
she
was
of
course
carefully
kept,
and
though
Mrs.
Wickham
frequently
invited
her
to
come
and
stay
with
her,
with
the
promise
of
balls
and
young
men,
her
father
would
never
consent
to
her
going.
Mary
was
the
only
daughter
who
remained
at
home;
and
she
was
necessarily
drawn
from
the
pursuit
of
accomplishments
by
Mrs.
Bennet's
being
quite
unable
to
sit
alone.
Mary
was
obliged
to
mix
more
with
the
world,
but
she
could
still
moralize
over
every
morning
visit;
and
as
she
was
no
longer
mortified
by
comparisons
between
her
sisters'
beauty
and
her
own,
it
was
suspected
by
her
father
that
she
submitted
to
the
change
without
much
reluctance.
As
for
Wickham
and
Lydia,
their
characters
suffered
no
revolution
from
the
marriage
of
her
sisters.
He
bore
with
philosophy
the
conviction
that
Elizabeth
must
now
become
acquainted
with
whatever
of
his
ingratitude
and
falsehood
had
before
been
unknown
to
her;
and
in
spite
of
every
thing,
was
not
wholly
without
hope
that
Darcy
might
yet
be
prevailed
on
to
make
his
fortune.
The
congratulatory
letter
which
Elizabeth
received
from
Lydia
on
her
marriage,
explained
to
her
that,
by
his
wife
at
least,
if
not
by
himself,
such
a
hope
was
cherished.
The
letter
was
to
this
effect:
"MY
DEAR
LIZZY,
"I
wish
you
joy.
If
you
love
Mr.
Darcy
half
as
well
as
I
do
my
dear
Wickham,
you
must
be
very
happy.
It
is
a
great
comfort
to
have
you
so
rich,
and
when
you
have
nothing
else
to
do,
I
hope
you
will
think
of
us.
I
am
sure
Wickham
would
like
a
place
at
court
very
much,
and
I
do
not
think
we
shall
have
quite
money
enough
to
live
upon
without
some
help.
Any
place
would
do,
of
about
three
or
four
hundred
a
year;
but
however,
do
not
speak
to
Mr.
Darcy
about
it,
if
you
had
rather
not.
"Yours,
etc."
As
it
happened
that
Elizabeth
had
much
rather
not,
she
endeavoured
in
her
answer
to
put
an
end
to
every
entreaty
and
expectation
of
the
kind.
Such
relief,
however,
as
it
was
in
her
power
to
afford,
by
the
practice
of
what
might
be
called
economy
