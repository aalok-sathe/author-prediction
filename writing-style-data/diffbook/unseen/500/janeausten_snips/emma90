Mr.
Elton
had
first
entered
not
two
years
ago,
to
make
his
way
as
he
could,
without
any
alliances
but
in
trade,
or
any
thing
to
recommend
him
to
notice
but
his
situation
and
his
civility.
But
he
had
fancied
her
in
love
with
him;
that
evidently
must
have
been
his
dependence;
and
after
raving
a
little
about
the
seeming
incongruity
of
gentle
manners
and
a
conceited
head,
Emma
was
obliged
in
common
honesty
to
stop
and
admit
that
her
own
behaviour
to
him
had
been
so
complaisant
and
obliging,
so
full
of
courtesy
and
attention,
as
(supposing
her
real
motive
unperceived)
might
warrant
a
man
of
ordinary
observation
and
delicacy,
like
Mr.
Elton,
in
fancying
himself
a
very
decided
favourite.
If
she
had
so
misinterpreted
his
feelings,
she
had
little
right
to
wonder
that
he,
with
self
interest
to
blind
him,
should
have
mistaken
hers.
The
first
error
and
the
worst
lay
at
her
door.
It
was
foolish,
it
was
wrong,
to
take
so
active
a
part
in
bringing
any
two
people
together.
It
was
adventuring
too
far,
assuming
too
much,
making
light
of
what
ought
to
be
serious,
a
trick
of
what
ought
to
be
simple.
She
was
quite
concerned
and
ashamed,
and
resolved
to
do
such
things
no
more.
"Here
have
I,"
said
she,
"actually
talked
poor
Harriet
into
being
very
much
attached
to
this
man.
She
might
never
have
thought
of
him
but
for
me;
and
certainly
never
would
have
thought
of
him
with
hope,
if
I
had
not
assured
her
of
his
attachment,
for
she
is
as
modest
and
humble
as
I
used
to
think
him.
Oh!
that
I
had
been
satisfied
with
persuading
her
not
to
accept
young
Martin.
There
I
was
quite
right.
That
was
well
done
of
me;
but
there
I
should
have
stopped,
and
left
the
rest
to
time
and
chance.
I
was
introducing
her
into
good
company,
and
giving
her
the
opportunity
of
pleasing
some
one
worth
having;
I
ought
not
to
have
attempted
more.
But
now,
poor
girl,
her
peace
is
cut
up
for
some
time.
I
have
been
but
half
a
friend
to
her;
and
if
she
were
not
to
feel
this
disappointment
so
very
much,
I
am
sure
I
have
not
an
idea
of
any
body
else
who
would
be
at
all
desirable
for
her;
William
Coxe
Oh!
no,
I
could
not
endure
William
Coxe
a
pert
young
lawyer."
She
stopt
to
blush
and
laugh
at
her
own
relapse,
and
then
resumed
a
more
serious,
more
dispiriting
cogitation
upon
what
had
been,
and
might
be,
and
must
be.
The
distressing
explanation
she
had
to
make
to
Harriet,
and
all
that
poor
Harriet
would
be
suffering,
with
the
awkwardness
of
future
meetings,
the
difficulties
of
continuing
or
discontinuing
the
acquaintance,
of
subduing
feelings,
concealing
resentment,
and
avoiding
eclat,
were
enough
to
occupy
her
in
most
unmirthful
reflections
some
time
longer,
and
she
went
to
bed
at
last
with
nothing
settled
but
the
conviction
of
her
having
blundered
most
