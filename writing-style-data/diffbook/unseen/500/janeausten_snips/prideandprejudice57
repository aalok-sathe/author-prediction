whole
room,
and
be
handed
down
to
posterity
with
all
the
eclat
of
a
proverb."
"This
is
no
very
striking
resemblance
of
your
own
character,
I
am
sure,"
said
he.
"How
near
it
may
be
to
mine,
I
cannot
pretend
to
say.
You
think
it
a
faithful
portrait
undoubtedly."
"I
must
not
decide
on
my
own
performance."
He
made
no
answer,
and
they
were
again
silent
till
they
had
gone
down
the
dance,
when
he
asked
her
if
she
and
her
sisters
did
not
very
often
walk
to
Meryton.
She
answered
in
the
affirmative,
and,
unable
to
resist
the
temptation,
added,
"When
you
met
us
there
the
other
day,
we
had
just
been
forming
a
new
acquaintance."
The
effect
was
immediate.
A
deeper
shade
of
hauteur
overspread
his
features,
but
he
said
not
a
word,
and
Elizabeth,
though
blaming
herself
for
her
own
weakness,
could
not
go
on.
At
length
Darcy
spoke,
and
in
a
constrained
manner
said,
"Mr.
Wickham
is
blessed
with
such
happy
manners
as
may
ensure
his
making
friends
whether
he
may
be
equally
capable
of
retaining
them,
is
less
certain."
"He
has
been
so
unlucky
as
to
lose
your
friendship,"
replied
Elizabeth
with
emphasis,
"and
in
a
manner
which
he
is
likely
to
suffer
from
all
his
life."
Darcy
made
no
answer,
and
seemed
desirous
of
changing
the
subject.
At
that
moment,
Sir
William
Lucas
appeared
close
to
them,
meaning
to
pass
through
the
set
to
the
other
side
of
the
room;
but
on
perceiving
Mr.
Darcy,
he
stopped
with
a
bow
of
superior
courtesy
to
compliment
him
on
his
dancing
and
his
partner.
"I
have
been
most
highly
gratified
indeed,
my
dear
sir.
Such
very
superior
dancing
is
not
often
seen.
It
is
evident
that
you
belong
to
the
first
circles.
Allow
me
to
say,
however,
that
your
fair
partner
does
not
disgrace
you,
and
that
I
must
hope
to
have
this
pleasure
often
repeated,
especially
when
a
certain
desirable
event,
my
dear
Eliza
(glancing
at
her
sister
and
Bingley)
shall
take
place.
What
congratulations
will
then
flow
in!
I
appeal
to
Mr.
Darcy:
but
let
me
not
interrupt
you,
sir.
You
will
not
thank
me
for
detaining
you
from
the
bewitching
converse
of
that
young
lady,
whose
bright
eyes
are
also
upbraiding
me."
The
latter
part
of
this
address
was
scarcely
heard
by
Darcy;
but
Sir
William's
allusion
to
his
friend
seemed
to
strike
him
forcibly,
and
his
eyes
were
directed
with
a
very
serious
expression
towards
Bingley
and
Jane,
who
were
dancing
together.
Recovering
himself,
however,
shortly,
he
turned
to
his
partner,
and
said,
"Sir
William's
interruption
has
made
me
forget
what
we
were
talking
of."
"I
do
not
think
we
were
speaking
at
all.
Sir
William
could
not
have
interrupted
two
people
in
the
room
who
had
less
to
say
for
themselves.
We
have
tried
two
or
three
subjects
already
without
success,
and
what
we
are
to
talk
of
next
I
cannot
imagine."
"What
think
you
of
books?"
said
he,
smiling.
"Books
