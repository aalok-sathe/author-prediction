the
wife
of
Mr.
Darcy
must
have
such
extraordinary
sources
of
happiness
necessarily
attached
to
her
situation,
that
she
could,
upon
the
whole,
have
no
cause
to
repine."
"Obstinate,
headstrong
girl!
I
am
ashamed
of
you!
Is
this
your
gratitude
for
my
attentions
to
you
last
spring?
Is
nothing
due
to
me
on
that
score?
Let
us
sit
down.
You
are
to
understand,
Miss
Bennet,
that
I
came
here
with
the
determined
resolution
of
carrying
my
purpose;
nor
will
I
be
dissuaded
from
it.
I
have
not
been
used
to
submit
to
any
person's
whims.
I
have
not
been
in
the
habit
of
brooking
disappointment."
"That
will
make
your
ladyship's
situation
at
present
more
pitiable;
but
it
will
have
no
effect
on
me."
"I
will
not
be
interrupted.
Hear
me
in
silence.
My
daughter
and
my
nephew
are
formed
for
each
other.
They
are
descended,
on
the
maternal
side,
from
the
same
noble
line;
and,
on
the
father's,
from
respectable,
honourable,
and
ancient
though
untitled
families.
Their
fortune
on
both
sides
is
splendid.
They
are
destined
for
each
other
by
the
voice
of
every
member
of
their
respective
houses;
and
what
is
to
divide
them?
The
upstart
pretensions
of
a
young
woman
without
family,
connections,
or
fortune.
Is
this
to
be
endured!
But
it
must
not,
shall
not
be.
If
you
were
sensible
of
your
own
good,
you
would
not
wish
to
quit
the
sphere
in
which
you
have
been
brought
up."
"In
marrying
your
nephew,
I
should
not
consider
myself
as
quitting
that
sphere.
He
is
a
gentleman;
I
am
a
gentleman's
daughter;
so
far
we
are
equal."
"True.
You
are
a
gentleman's
daughter.
But
who
was
your
mother?
Who
are
your
uncles
and
aunts?
Do
not
imagine
me
ignorant
of
their
condition."
"Whatever
my
connections
may
be,"
said
Elizabeth,
"if
your
nephew
does
not
object
to
them,
they
can
be
nothing
to
you."
"Tell
me
once
for
all,
are
you
engaged
to
him?"
Though
Elizabeth
would
not,
for
the
mere
purpose
of
obliging
Lady
Catherine,
have
answered
this
question,
she
could
not
but
say,
after
a
moment's
deliberation:
"I
am
not."
Lady
Catherine
seemed
pleased.
"And
will
you
promise
me,
never
to
enter
into
such
an
engagement?"
"I
will
make
no
promise
of
the
kind."
"Miss
Bennet
I
am
shocked
and
astonished.
I
expected
to
find
a
more
reasonable
young
woman.
But
do
not
deceive
yourself
into
a
belief
that
I
will
ever
recede.
I
shall
not
go
away
till
you
have
given
me
the
assurance
I
require."
"And
I
certainly
never
shall
give
it.
I
am
not
to
be
intimidated
into
anything
so
wholly
unreasonable.
Your
ladyship
wants
Mr.
Darcy
to
marry
your
daughter;
but
would
my
giving
you
the
wished
for
promise
make
their
marriage
at
all
more
probable?
Supposing
him
to
be
attached
to
me,
would
my
refusing
to
accept
his
hand
make
him
wish
to
bestow
it
on
his
cousin?
Allow
me
to
say,
Lady
Catherine,
that
the
arguments
with
which
you
have
supported
