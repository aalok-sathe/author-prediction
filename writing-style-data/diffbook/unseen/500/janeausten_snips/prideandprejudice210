time
after
receiving
his
explanatory
letter.
Both
sisters
were
uncomfortable
enough.
Each
felt
for
the
other,
and
of
course
for
themselves;
and
their
mother
talked
on,
of
her
dislike
of
Mr.
Darcy,
and
her
resolution
to
be
civil
to
him
only
as
Mr.
Bingley's
friend,
without
being
heard
by
either
of
them.
But
Elizabeth
had
sources
of
uneasiness
which
could
not
be
suspected
by
Jane,
to
whom
she
had
never
yet
had
courage
to
shew
Mrs.
Gardiner's
letter,
or
to
relate
her
own
change
of
sentiment
towards
him.
To
Jane,
he
could
be
only
a
man
whose
proposals
she
had
refused,
and
whose
merit
she
had
undervalued;
but
to
her
own
more
extensive
information,
he
was
the
person
to
whom
the
whole
family
were
indebted
for
the
first
of
benefits,
and
whom
she
regarded
herself
with
an
interest,
if
not
quite
so
tender,
at
least
as
reasonable
and
just
as
what
Jane
felt
for
Bingley.
Her
astonishment
at
his
coming
at
his
coming
to
Netherfield,
to
Longbourn,
and
voluntarily
seeking
her
again,
was
almost
equal
to
what
she
had
known
on
first
witnessing
his
altered
behaviour
in
Derbyshire.
The
colour
which
had
been
driven
from
her
face,
returned
for
half
a
minute
with
an
additional
glow,
and
a
smile
of
delight
added
lustre
to
her
eyes,
as
she
thought
for
that
space
of
time
that
his
affection
and
wishes
must
still
be
unshaken.
But
she
would
not
be
secure.
"Let
me
first
see
how
he
behaves,"
said
she;
"it
will
then
be
early
enough
for
expectation."
She
sat
intently
at
work,
striving
to
be
composed,
and
without
daring
to
lift
up
her
eyes,
till
anxious
curiosity
carried
them
to
the
face
of
her
sister
as
the
servant
was
approaching
the
door.
Jane
looked
a
little
paler
than
usual,
but
more
sedate
than
Elizabeth
had
expected.
On
the
gentlemen's
appearing,
her
colour
increased;
yet
she
received
them
with
tolerable
ease,
and
with
a
propriety
of
behaviour
equally
free
from
any
symptom
of
resentment
or
any
unnecessary
complaisance.
Elizabeth
said
as
little
to
either
as
civility
would
allow,
and
sat
down
again
to
her
work,
with
an
eagerness
which
it
did
not
often
command.
She
had
ventured
only
one
glance
at
Darcy.
He
looked
serious,
as
usual;
and,
she
thought,
more
as
he
had
been
used
to
look
in
Hertfordshire,
than
as
she
had
seen
him
at
Pemberley.
But,
perhaps
he
could
not
in
her
mother's
presence
be
what
he
was
before
her
uncle
and
aunt.
It
was
a
painful,
but
not
an
improbable,
conjecture.
Bingley,
she
had
likewise
seen
for
an
instant,
and
in
that
short
period
saw
him
looking
both
pleased
and
embarrassed.
He
was
received
by
Mrs.
Bennet
with
a
degree
of
civility
which
made
her
two
daughters
ashamed,
especially
when
contrasted
with
the
cold
and
ceremonious
politeness
of
her
curtsey
and
address
to
his
friend.
Elizabeth,
particularly,
who
knew
that
her
mother
owed
to
the
latter
the
preservation
of
her
favourite
daughter
from
irremediable
infamy,
was
hurt
and
