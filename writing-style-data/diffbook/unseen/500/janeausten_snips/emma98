excuses
for
it.
He
can
sit
down
and
write
a
fine
flourishing
letter,
full
of
professions
and
falsehoods,
and
persuade
himself
that
he
has
hit
upon
the
very
best
method
in
the
world
of
preserving
peace
at
home
and
preventing
his
father's
having
any
right
to
complain.
His
letters
disgust
me."
"Your
feelings
are
singular.
They
seem
to
satisfy
every
body
else."
"I
suspect
they
do
not
satisfy
Mrs.
Weston.
They
hardly
can
satisfy
a
woman
of
her
good
sense
and
quick
feelings:
standing
in
a
mother's
place,
but
without
a
mother's
affection
to
blind
her.
It
is
on
her
account
that
attention
to
Randalls
is
doubly
due,
and
she
must
doubly
feel
the
omission.
Had
she
been
a
person
of
consequence
herself,
he
would
have
come
I
dare
say;
and
it
would
not
have
signified
whether
he
did
or
no.
Can
you
think
your
friend
behindhand
in
these
sort
of
considerations?
Do
you
suppose
she
does
not
often
say
all
this
to
herself?
No,
Emma,
your
amiable
young
man
can
be
amiable
only
in
French,
not
in
English.
He
may
be
very
'amiable,'
have
very
good
manners,
and
be
very
agreeable;
but
he
can
have
no
English
delicacy
towards
the
feelings
of
other
people:
nothing
really
amiable
about
him."
"You
seem
determined
to
think
ill
of
him."
"Me!
not
at
all,"
replied
Mr.
Knightley,
rather
displeased;
"I
do
not
want
to
think
ill
of
him.
I
should
be
as
ready
to
acknowledge
his
merits
as
any
other
man;
but
I
hear
of
none,
except
what
are
merely
personal;
that
he
is
well
grown
and
good
looking,
with
smooth,
plausible
manners."
"Well,
if
he
have
nothing
else
to
recommend
him,
he
will
be
a
treasure
at
Highbury.
We
do
not
often
look
upon
fine
young
men,
well
bred
and
agreeable.
We
must
not
be
nice
and
ask
for
all
the
virtues
into
the
bargain.
Cannot
you
imagine,
Mr.
Knightley,
what
a
sensation
his
coming
will
produce?
There
will
be
but
one
subject
throughout
the
parishes
of
Donwell
and
Highbury;
but
one
interest
one
object
of
curiosity;
it
will
be
all
Mr.
Frank
Churchill;
we
shall
think
and
speak
of
nobody
else."
"You
will
excuse
my
being
so
much
over
powered.
If
I
find
him
conversable,
I
shall
be
glad
of
his
acquaintance;
but
if
he
is
only
a
chattering
coxcomb,
he
will
not
occupy
much
of
my
time
or
thoughts."
"My
idea
of
him
is,
that
he
can
adapt
his
conversation
to
the
taste
of
every
body,
and
has
the
power
as
well
as
the
wish
of
being
universally
agreeable.
To
you,
he
will
talk
of
farming;
to
me,
of
drawing
or
music;
and
so
on
to
every
body,
having
that
general
information
on
all
subjects
which
will
enable
him
to
follow
the
lead,
or
take
the
lead,
just
as
propriety
may
require,
and
to
speak
extremely
well
on
each;
that
is
my
idea
of
him."
"And
mine,"
said
Mr.
Knightley
warmly,
"is,
that
if
he
turn
out
any
thing
