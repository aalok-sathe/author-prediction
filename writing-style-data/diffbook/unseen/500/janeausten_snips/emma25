love
her
really
too
well
to
be
unjust
or
unkind;
but
excuse
me,
Mr.
Knightley,
if
I
take
the
liberty
(I
consider
myself,
you
know,
as
having
somewhat
of
the
privilege
of
speech
that
Emma's
mother
might
have
had)
the
liberty
of
hinting
that
I
do
not
think
any
possible
good
can
arise
from
Harriet
Smith's
intimacy
being
made
a
matter
of
much
discussion
among
you.
Pray
excuse
me;
but
supposing
any
little
inconvenience
may
be
apprehended
from
the
intimacy,
it
cannot
be
expected
that
Emma,
accountable
to
nobody
but
her
father,
who
perfectly
approves
the
acquaintance,
should
put
an
end
to
it,
so
long
as
it
is
a
source
of
pleasure
to
herself.
It
has
been
so
many
years
my
province
to
give
advice,
that
you
cannot
be
surprized,
Mr.
Knightley,
at
this
little
remains
of
office."
"Not
at
all,"
cried
he;
"I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
it.
It
is
very
good
advice,
and
it
shall
have
a
better
fate
than
your
advice
has
often
found;
for
it
shall
be
attended
to."
"Mrs.
John
Knightley
is
easily
alarmed,
and
might
be
made
unhappy
about
her
sister."
"Be
satisfied,"
said
he,
"I
will
not
raise
any
outcry.
I
will
keep
my
ill
humour
to
myself.
I
have
a
very
sincere
interest
in
Emma.
Isabella
does
not
seem
more
my
sister;
has
never
excited
a
greater
interest;
perhaps
hardly
so
great.
There
is
an
anxiety,
a
curiosity
in
what
one
feels
for
Emma.
I
wonder
what
will
become
of
her!"
"So
do
I,"
said
Mrs.
Weston
gently,
"very
much."
"She
always
declares
she
will
never
marry,
which,
of
course,
means
just
nothing
at
all.
But
I
have
no
idea
that
she
has
yet
ever
seen
a
man
she
cared
for.
It
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
for
her
to
be
very
much
in
love
with
a
proper
object.
I
should
like
to
see
Emma
in
love,
and
in
some
doubt
of
a
return;
it
would
do
her
good.
But
there
is
nobody
hereabouts
to
attach
her;
and
she
goes
so
seldom
from
home."
"There
does,
indeed,
seem
as
little
to
tempt
her
to
break
her
resolution
at
present,"
said
Mrs.
Weston,
"as
can
well
be;
and
while
she
is
so
happy
at
Hartfield,
I
cannot
wish
her
to
be
forming
any
attachment
which
would
be
creating
such
difficulties
on
poor
Mr.
Woodhouse's
account.
I
do
not
recommend
matrimony
at
present
to
Emma,
though
I
mean
no
slight
to
the
state,
I
assure
you."
Part
of
her
meaning
was
to
conceal
some
favourite
thoughts
of
her
own
and
Mr.
Weston's
on
the
subject,
as
much
as
possible.
There
were
wishes
at
Randalls
respecting
Emma's
destiny,
but
it
was
not
desirable
to
have
them
suspected;
and
the
quiet
transition
which
Mr.
Knightley
soon
afterwards
made
to
"What
does
Weston
think
of
the
weather;
shall
we
have
rain?"
convinced
her
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
or
surmise
about
Hartfield.
Emma
could
not
feel
a
doubt
of
having
given
Harriet's
