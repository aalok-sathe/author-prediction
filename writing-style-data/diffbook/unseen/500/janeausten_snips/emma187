could
make
me
regret
having
asked
more
than
Jane
Fairfax
to
partake
of
it.
I
have
no
idea
of
that
sort
of
thing.
It
is
not
likely
that
I
should,
considering
what
I
have
been
used
to.
My
greatest
danger,
perhaps,
in
housekeeping,
may
be
quite
the
other
way,
in
doing
too
much,
and
being
too
careless
of
expense.
Maple
Grove
will
probably
be
my
model
more
than
it
ought
to
be
for
we
do
not
at
all
affect
to
equal
my
brother,
Mr.
Suckling,
in
income.
However,
my
resolution
is
taken
as
to
noticing
Jane
Fairfax.
I
shall
certainly
have
her
very
often
at
my
house,
shall
introduce
her
wherever
I
can,
shall
have
musical
parties
to
draw
out
her
talents,
and
shall
be
constantly
on
the
watch
for
an
eligible
situation.
My
acquaintance
is
so
very
extensive,
that
I
have
little
doubt
of
hearing
of
something
to
suit
her
shortly.
I
shall
introduce
her,
of
course,
very
particularly
to
my
brother
and
sister
when
they
come
to
us.
I
am
sure
they
will
like
her
extremely;
and
when
she
gets
a
little
acquainted
with
them,
her
fears
will
completely
wear
off,
for
there
really
is
nothing
in
the
manners
of
either
but
what
is
highly
conciliating.
I
shall
have
her
very
often
indeed
while
they
are
with
me,
and
I
dare
say
we
shall
sometimes
find
a
seat
for
her
in
the
barouche
landau
in
some
of
our
exploring
parties."
"Poor
Jane
Fairfax!"
thought
Emma.
"You
have
not
deserved
this.
You
may
have
done
wrong
with
regard
to
Mr.
Dixon,
but
this
is
a
punishment
beyond
what
you
can
have
merited!
The
kindness
and
protection
of
Mrs.
Elton!
'Jane
Fairfax
and
Jane
Fairfax.'
Heavens!
Let
me
not
suppose
that
she
dares
go
about,
Emma
Woodhouse
ing
me!
But
upon
my
honour,
there
seems
no
limits
to
the
licentiousness
of
that
woman's
tongue!"
Emma
had
not
to
listen
to
such
paradings
again
to
any
so
exclusively
addressed
to
herself
so
disgustingly
decorated
with
a
"dear
Miss
Woodhouse."
The
change
on
Mrs.
Elton's
side
soon
afterwards
appeared,
and
she
was
left
in
peace
neither
forced
to
be
the
very
particular
friend
of
Mrs.
Elton,
nor,
under
Mrs.
Elton's
guidance,
the
very
active
patroness
of
Jane
Fairfax,
and
only
sharing
with
others
in
a
general
way,
in
knowing
what
was
felt,
what
was
meditated,
what
was
done.
She
looked
on
with
some
amusement.
Miss
Bates's
gratitude
for
Mrs.
Elton's
attentions
to
Jane
was
in
the
first
style
of
guileless
simplicity
and
warmth.
She
was
quite
one
of
her
worthies
the
most
amiable,
affable,
delightful
woman
just
as
accomplished
and
condescending
as
Mrs.
Elton
meant
to
be
considered.
Emma's
only
surprize
was
that
Jane
Fairfax
should
accept
those
attentions
and
tolerate
Mrs.
Elton
as
she
seemed
to
do.
She
heard
of
her
walking
with
the
Eltons,
sitting
with
the
Eltons,
spending
a
day
with
the
Eltons!
This
was
astonishing!
She
could
not
have
believed
it
possible
that
the
taste
or
the
pride
