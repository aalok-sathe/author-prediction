know
what
he
would
say
on
the
subject
of
their
hasty
departure,
she
observed:
"How
very
suddenly
you
all
quitted
Netherfield
last
November,
Mr.
Darcy!
It
must
have
been
a
most
agreeable
surprise
to
Mr.
Bingley
to
see
you
all
after
him
so
soon;
for,
if
I
recollect
right,
he
went
but
the
day
before.
He
and
his
sisters
were
well,
I
hope,
when
you
left
London?"
"Perfectly
so,
I
thank
you."
She
found
that
she
was
to
receive
no
other
answer,
and,
after
a
short
pause
added:
"I
think
I
have
understood
that
Mr.
Bingley
has
not
much
idea
of
ever
returning
to
Netherfield
again?"
"I
have
never
heard
him
say
so;
but
it
is
probable
that
he
may
spend
very
little
of
his
time
there
in
the
future.
He
has
many
friends,
and
is
at
a
time
of
life
when
friends
and
engagements
are
continually
increasing."
"If
he
means
to
be
but
little
at
Netherfield,
it
would
be
better
for
the
neighbourhood
that
he
should
give
up
the
place
entirely,
for
then
we
might
possibly
get
a
settled
family
there.
But,
perhaps,
Mr.
Bingley
did
not
take
the
house
so
much
for
the
convenience
of
the
neighbourhood
as
for
his
own,
and
we
must
expect
him
to
keep
it
or
quit
it
on
the
same
principle."
"I
should
not
be
surprised,"
said
Darcy,
"if
he
were
to
give
it
up
as
soon
as
any
eligible
purchase
offers."
Elizabeth
made
no
answer.
She
was
afraid
of
talking
longer
of
his
friend;
and,
having
nothing
else
to
say,
was
now
determined
to
leave
the
trouble
of
finding
a
subject
to
him.
He
took
the
hint,
and
soon
began
with,
"This
seems
a
very
comfortable
house.
Lady
Catherine,
I
believe,
did
a
great
deal
to
it
when
Mr.
Collins
first
came
to
Hunsford."
"I
believe
she
did
and
I
am
sure
she
could
not
have
bestowed
her
kindness
on
a
more
grateful
object."
"Mr.
Collins
appears
to
be
very
fortunate
in
his
choice
of
a
wife."
"Yes,
indeed,
his
friends
may
well
rejoice
in
his
having
met
with
one
of
the
very
few
sensible
women
who
would
have
accepted
him,
or
have
made
him
happy
if
they
had.
My
friend
has
an
excellent
understanding
though
I
am
not
certain
that
I
consider
her
marrying
Mr.
Collins
as
the
wisest
thing
she
ever
did.
She
seems
perfectly
happy,
however,
and
in
a
prudential
light
it
is
certainly
a
very
good
match
for
her."
"It
must
be
very
agreeable
for
her
to
be
settled
within
so
easy
a
distance
of
her
own
family
and
friends."
"An
easy
distance,
do
you
call
it?
It
is
nearly
fifty
miles."
"And
what
is
fifty
miles
of
good
road?
Little
more
than
half
a
day's
journey.
Yes,
I
call
it
a
very
easy
distance."
"I
should
never
have
considered
the
distance
as
one
of
the
advantages
of
the
match,"
cried
Elizabeth.
"I
should
never
have
said
Mrs.
Collins
was
settled
near
her
family."
"It
is
a
proof
