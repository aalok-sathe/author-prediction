pretty
kind
of
girl.
She
asked
her,
at
different
times,
how
many
sisters
she
had,
whether
they
were
older
or
younger
than
herself,
whether
any
of
them
were
likely
to
be
married,
whether
they
were
handsome,
where
they
had
been
educated,
what
carriage
her
father
kept,
and
what
had
been
her
mother's
maiden
name?
Elizabeth
felt
all
the
impertinence
of
her
questions
but
answered
them
very
composedly.
Lady
Catherine
then
observed,
"Your
father's
estate
is
entailed
on
Mr.
Collins,
I
think.
For
your
sake,"
turning
to
Charlotte,
"I
am
glad
of
it;
but
otherwise
I
see
no
occasion
for
entailing
estates
from
the
female
line.
It
was
not
thought
necessary
in
Sir
Lewis
de
Bourgh's
family.
Do
you
play
and
sing,
Miss
Bennet?"
"A
little."
"Oh!
then
some
time
or
other
we
shall
be
happy
to
hear
you.
Our
instrument
is
a
capital
one,
probably
superior
to
You
shall
try
it
some
day.
Do
your
sisters
play
and
sing?"
"One
of
them
does."
"Why
did
not
you
all
learn?
You
ought
all
to
have
learned.
The
Miss
Webbs
all
play,
and
their
father
has
not
so
good
an
income
as
yours.
Do
you
draw?"
"No,
not
at
all."
"What,
none
of
you?"
"Not
one."
"That
is
very
strange.
But
I
suppose
you
had
no
opportunity.
Your
mother
should
have
taken
you
to
town
every
spring
for
the
benefit
of
masters."
"My
mother
would
have
had
no
objection,
but
my
father
hates
London."
"Has
your
governess
left
you?"
"We
never
had
any
governess."
"No
governess!
How
was
that
possible?
Five
daughters
brought
up
at
home
without
a
governess!
I
never
heard
of
such
a
thing.
Your
mother
must
have
been
quite
a
slave
to
your
education."
Elizabeth
could
hardly
help
smiling
as
she
assured
her
that
had
not
been
the
case.
"Then,
who
taught
you?
who
attended
to
you?
Without
a
governess,
you
must
have
been
neglected."
"Compared
with
some
families,
I
believe
we
were;
but
such
of
us
as
wished
to
learn
never
wanted
the
means.
We
were
always
encouraged
to
read,
and
had
all
the
masters
that
were
necessary.
Those
who
chose
to
be
idle,
certainly
might."
"Aye,
no
doubt;
but
that
is
what
a
governess
will
prevent,
and
if
I
had
known
your
mother,
I
should
have
advised
her
most
strenuously
to
engage
one.
I
always
say
that
nothing
is
to
be
done
in
education
without
steady
and
regular
instruction,
and
nobody
but
a
governess
can
give
it.
It
is
wonderful
how
many
families
I
have
been
the
means
of
supplying
in
that
way.
I
am
always
glad
to
get
a
young
person
well
placed
out.
Four
nieces
of
Mrs.
Jenkinson
are
most
delightfully
situated
through
my
means;
and
it
was
but
the
other
day
that
I
recommended
another
young
person,
who
was
merely
accidentally
mentioned
to
me,
and
the
family
are
quite
delighted
with
her.
Mrs.
Collins,
did
I
tell
you
of
Lady
Metcalf's
calling
yesterday
to
thank
me?
She
finds
Miss
Pope
a
treasure.
'Lady
Catherine,'
