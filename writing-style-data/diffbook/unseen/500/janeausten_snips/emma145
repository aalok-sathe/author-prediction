must
be
thinking.
She
was
his
object,
and
every
body
must
perceive
it.
She
introduced
him
to
her
friend,
Miss
Smith,
and,
at
convenient
moments
afterwards,
heard
what
each
thought
of
the
other.
"He
had
never
seen
so
lovely
a
face,
and
was
delighted
with
her
naivete."
And
she,
"Only
to
be
sure
it
was
paying
him
too
great
a
compliment,
but
she
did
think
there
were
some
looks
a
little
like
Mr.
Elton."
Emma
restrained
her
indignation,
and
only
turned
from
her
in
silence.
Smiles
of
intelligence
passed
between
her
and
the
gentleman
on
first
glancing
towards
Miss
Fairfax;
but
it
was
most
prudent
to
avoid
speech.
He
told
her
that
he
had
been
impatient
to
leave
the
dining
room
hated
sitting
long
was
always
the
first
to
move
when
he
could
that
his
father,
Mr.
Knightley,
Mr.
Cox,
and
Mr.
Cole,
were
left
very
busy
over
parish
business
that
as
long
as
he
had
staid,
however,
it
had
been
pleasant
enough,
as
he
had
found
them
in
general
a
set
of
gentlemanlike,
sensible
men;
and
spoke
so
handsomely
of
Highbury
altogether
thought
it
so
abundant
in
agreeable
families
that
Emma
began
to
feel
she
had
been
used
to
despise
the
place
rather
too
much.
She
questioned
him
as
to
the
society
in
Yorkshire
the
extent
of
the
neighbourhood
about
Enscombe,
and
the
sort;
and
could
make
out
from
his
answers
that,
as
far
as
Enscombe
was
concerned,
there
was
very
little
going
on,
that
their
visitings
were
among
a
range
of
great
families,
none
very
near;
and
that
even
when
days
were
fixed,
and
invitations
accepted,
it
was
an
even
chance
that
Mrs.
Churchill
were
not
in
health
and
spirits
for
going;
that
they
made
a
point
of
visiting
no
fresh
person;
and
that,
though
he
had
his
separate
engagements,
it
was
not
without
difficulty,
without
considerable
address
at
times,
that
he
could
get
away,
or
introduce
an
acquaintance
for
a
night.
She
saw
that
Enscombe
could
not
satisfy,
and
that
Highbury,
taken
at
its
best,
might
reasonably
please
a
young
man
who
had
more
retirement
at
home
than
he
liked.
His
importance
at
Enscombe
was
very
evident.
He
did
not
boast,
but
it
naturally
betrayed
itself,
that
he
had
persuaded
his
aunt
where
his
uncle
could
do
nothing,
and
on
her
laughing
and
noticing
it,
he
owned
that
he
believed
(excepting
one
or
two
points)
he
could
with
time
persuade
her
to
any
thing.
One
of
those
points
on
which
his
influence
failed,
he
then
mentioned.
He
had
wanted
very
much
to
go
abroad
had
been
very
eager
indeed
to
be
allowed
to
travel
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it.
This
had
happened
the
year
before.
Now,
he
said,
he
was
beginning
to
have
no
longer
the
same
wish.
The
unpersuadable
point,
which
he
did
not
mention,
Emma
guessed
to
be
good
behaviour
to
his
father.
"I
have
made
a
most
wretched
discovery,"
said
he,
after
a
short
pause.
"I
have
been
here
a
week
to
