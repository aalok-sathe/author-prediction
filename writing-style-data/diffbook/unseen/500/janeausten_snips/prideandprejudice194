in
size
and
importance.
"Haye
Park
might
do,"
said
she,
"if
the
Gouldings
could
quit
it
or
the
great
house
at
Stoke,
if
the
drawing
room
were
larger;
but
Ashworth
is
too
far
off!
I
could
not
bear
to
have
her
ten
miles
from
me;
and
as
for
Pulvis
Lodge,
the
attics
are
dreadful."
Her
husband
allowed
her
to
talk
on
without
interruption
while
the
servants
remained.
But
when
they
had
withdrawn,
he
said
to
her:
"Mrs.
Bennet,
before
you
take
any
or
all
of
these
houses
for
your
son
and
daughter,
let
us
come
to
a
right
understanding.
Into
one
house
in
this
neighbourhood
they
shall
never
have
admittance.
I
will
not
encourage
the
impudence
of
either,
by
receiving
them
at
Longbourn."
A
long
dispute
followed
this
declaration;
but
Mr.
Bennet
was
firm.
It
soon
led
to
another;
and
Mrs.
Bennet
found,
with
amazement
and
horror,
that
her
husband
would
not
advance
a
guinea
to
buy
clothes
for
his
daughter.
He
protested
that
she
should
receive
from
him
no
mark
of
affection
whatever
on
the
occasion.
Mrs.
Bennet
could
hardly
comprehend
it.
That
his
anger
could
be
carried
to
such
a
point
of
inconceivable
resentment
as
to
refuse
his
daughter
a
privilege
without
which
her
marriage
would
scarcely
seem
valid,
exceeded
all
she
could
believe
possible.
She
was
more
alive
to
the
disgrace
which
her
want
of
new
clothes
must
reflect
on
her
daughter's
nuptials,
than
to
any
sense
of
shame
at
her
eloping
and
living
with
Wickham
a
fortnight
before
they
took
place.
Elizabeth
was
now
most
heartily
sorry
that
she
had,
from
the
distress
of
the
moment,
been
led
to
make
Mr.
Darcy
acquainted
with
their
fears
for
her
sister;
for
since
her
marriage
would
so
shortly
give
the
proper
termination
to
the
elopement,
they
might
hope
to
conceal
its
unfavourable
beginning
from
all
those
who
were
not
immediately
on
the
spot.
She
had
no
fear
of
its
spreading
farther
through
his
means.
There
were
few
people
on
whose
secrecy
she
would
have
more
confidently
depended;
but,
at
the
same
time,
there
was
no
one
whose
knowledge
of
a
sister's
frailty
would
have
mortified
her
so
much
not,
however,
from
any
fear
of
disadvantage
from
it
individually
to
herself,
for,
at
any
rate,
there
seemed
a
gulf
impassable
between
them.
Had
Lydia's
marriage
been
concluded
on
the
most
honourable
terms,
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
Mr.
Darcy
would
connect
himself
with
a
family
where,
to
every
other
objection,
would
now
be
added
an
alliance
and
relationship
of
the
nearest
kind
with
a
man
whom
he
so
justly
scorned.
From
such
a
connection
she
could
not
wonder
that
he
would
shrink.
The
wish
of
procuring
her
regard,
which
she
had
assured
herself
of
his
feeling
in
Derbyshire,
could
not
in
rational
expectation
survive
such
a
blow
as
this.
She
was
humbled,
she
was
grieved;
she
repented,
though
she
hardly
knew
of
what.
She
became
jealous
of
his
esteem,
when
she
could
no
longer
hope
to
be
