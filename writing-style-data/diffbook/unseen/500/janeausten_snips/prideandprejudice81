pronounced
to
be
of
a
most
agreeable
sort;
for
it
gratified
him,
he
said,
to
discover
that
Charlotte
Lucas,
whom
he
had
been
used
to
think
tolerably
sensible,
was
as
foolish
as
his
wife,
and
more
foolish
than
his
daughter!
Jane
confessed
herself
a
little
surprised
at
the
match;
but
she
said
less
of
her
astonishment
than
of
her
earnest
desire
for
their
happiness;
nor
could
Elizabeth
persuade
her
to
consider
it
as
improbable.
Kitty
and
Lydia
were
far
from
envying
Miss
Lucas,
for
Mr.
Collins
was
only
a
clergyman;
and
it
affected
them
in
no
other
way
than
as
a
piece
of
news
to
spread
at
Meryton.
Lady
Lucas
could
not
be
insensible
of
triumph
on
being
able
to
retort
on
Mrs.
Bennet
the
comfort
of
having
a
daughter
well
married;
and
she
called
at
Longbourn
rather
oftener
than
usual
to
say
how
happy
she
was,
though
Mrs.
Bennet's
sour
looks
and
ill
natured
remarks
might
have
been
enough
to
drive
happiness
away.
Between
Elizabeth
and
Charlotte
there
was
a
restraint
which
kept
them
mutually
silent
on
the
subject;
and
Elizabeth
felt
persuaded
that
no
real
confidence
could
ever
subsist
between
them
again.
Her
disappointment
in
Charlotte
made
her
turn
with
fonder
regard
to
her
sister,
of
whose
rectitude
and
delicacy
she
was
sure
her
opinion
could
never
be
shaken,
and
for
whose
happiness
she
grew
daily
more
anxious,
as
Bingley
had
now
been
gone
a
week
and
nothing
more
was
heard
of
his
return.
Jane
had
sent
Caroline
an
early
answer
to
her
letter,
and
was
counting
the
days
till
she
might
reasonably
hope
to
hear
again.
The
promised
letter
of
thanks
from
Mr.
Collins
arrived
on
Tuesday,
addressed
to
their
father,
and
written
with
all
the
solemnity
of
gratitude
which
a
twelvemonth's
abode
in
the
family
might
have
prompted.
After
discharging
his
conscience
on
that
head,
he
proceeded
to
inform
them,
with
many
rapturous
expressions,
of
his
happiness
in
having
obtained
the
affection
of
their
amiable
neighbour,
Miss
Lucas,
and
then
explained
that
it
was
merely
with
the
view
of
enjoying
her
society
that
he
had
been
so
ready
to
close
with
their
kind
wish
of
seeing
him
again
at
Longbourn,
whither
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
return
on
Monday
fortnight;
for
Lady
Catherine,
he
added,
so
heartily
approved
his
marriage,
that
she
wished
it
to
take
place
as
soon
as
possible,
which
he
trusted
would
be
an
unanswerable
argument
with
his
amiable
Charlotte
to
name
an
early
day
for
making
him
the
happiest
of
men.
Mr.
Collins's
return
into
Hertfordshire
was
no
longer
a
matter
of
pleasure
to
Mrs.
Bennet.
On
the
contrary,
she
was
as
much
disposed
to
complain
of
it
as
her
husband.
It
was
very
strange
that
he
should
come
to
Longbourn
instead
of
to
Lucas
Lodge;
it
was
also
very
inconvenient
and
exceedingly
troublesome.
She
hated
having
visitors
in
the
house
while
her
health
was
so
indifferent,
and
lovers
were
of
all
people
the
most
disagreeable.
Such
were
the
gentle
murmurs
