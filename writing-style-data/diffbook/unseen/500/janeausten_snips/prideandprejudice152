they
had
descended,
receiving
increased
abruptness
from
the
distance,
was
a
beautiful
object.
Every
disposition
of
the
ground
was
good;
and
she
looked
on
the
whole
scene,
the
river,
the
trees
scattered
on
its
banks
and
the
winding
of
the
valley,
as
far
as
she
could
trace
it,
with
delight.
As
they
passed
into
other
rooms
these
objects
were
taking
different
positions;
but
from
every
window
there
were
beauties
to
be
seen.
The
rooms
were
lofty
and
handsome,
and
their
furniture
suitable
to
the
fortune
of
its
proprietor;
but
Elizabeth
saw,
with
admiration
of
his
taste,
that
it
was
neither
gaudy
nor
uselessly
fine;
with
less
of
splendour,
and
more
real
elegance,
than
the
furniture
of
Rosings.
"And
of
this
place,"
thought
she,
"I
might
have
been
mistress!
With
these
rooms
I
might
now
have
been
familiarly
acquainted!
Instead
of
viewing
them
as
a
stranger,
I
might
have
rejoiced
in
them
as
my
own,
and
welcomed
to
them
as
visitors
my
uncle
and
aunt.
But
no,"
recollecting
herself
"that
could
never
be;
my
uncle
and
aunt
would
have
been
lost
to
me;
I
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
invite
them."
This
was
a
lucky
recollection
it
saved
her
from
something
very
like
regret.
She
longed
to
inquire
of
the
housekeeper
whether
her
master
was
really
absent,
but
had
not
the
courage
for
it.
At
length
however,
the
question
was
asked
by
her
uncle;
and
she
turned
away
with
alarm,
while
Mrs.
Reynolds
replied
that
he
was,
adding,
"But
we
expect
him
to
morrow,
with
a
large
party
of
friends."
How
rejoiced
was
Elizabeth
that
their
own
journey
had
not
by
any
circumstance
been
delayed
a
day!
Her
aunt
now
called
her
to
look
at
a
picture.
She
approached
and
saw
the
likeness
of
Mr.
Wickham,
suspended,
amongst
several
other
miniatures,
over
the
mantelpiece.
Her
aunt
asked
her,
smilingly,
how
she
liked
it.
The
housekeeper
came
forward,
and
told
them
it
was
a
picture
of
a
young
gentleman,
the
son
of
her
late
master's
steward,
who
had
been
brought
up
by
him
at
his
own
expense.
"He
is
now
gone
into
the
army,"
she
added;
"but
I
am
afraid
he
has
turned
out
very
wild."
Mrs.
Gardiner
looked
at
her
niece
with
a
smile,
but
Elizabeth
could
not
return
it.
"And
that,"
said
Mrs.
Reynolds,
pointing
to
another
of
the
miniatures,
"is
my
master
and
very
like
him.
It
was
drawn
at
the
same
time
as
the
other
about
eight
years
ago."
"I
have
heard
much
of
your
master's
fine
person,"
said
Mrs.
Gardiner,
looking
at
the
picture;
"it
is
a
handsome
face.
But,
Lizzy,
you
can
tell
us
whether
it
is
like
or
not."
Mrs.
Reynolds
respect
for
Elizabeth
seemed
to
increase
on
this
intimation
of
her
knowing
her
master.
"Does
that
young
lady
know
Mr.
Darcy?"
Elizabeth
coloured,
and
said:
"A
little."
"And
do
not
you
think
him
a
very
handsome
gentleman,
ma'am?"
"Yes,
very
handsome."
"I
am
sure
I
know
none
so
handsome;
