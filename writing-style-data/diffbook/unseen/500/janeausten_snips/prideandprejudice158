the
acquaintance
of
some
of
those
very
people
against
whom
his
pride
had
revolted
in
his
offer
to
herself.
"What
will
be
his
surprise,"
thought
she,
"when
he
knows
who
they
are?
He
takes
them
now
for
people
of
fashion."
The
introduction,
however,
was
immediately
made;
and
as
she
named
their
relationship
to
herself,
she
stole
a
sly
look
at
him,
to
see
how
he
bore
it,
and
was
not
without
the
expectation
of
his
decamping
as
fast
as
he
could
from
such
disgraceful
companions.
That
he
was
surprised
by
the
connection
was
evident;
he
sustained
it,
however,
with
fortitude,
and
so
far
from
going
away,
turned
back
with
them,
and
entered
into
conversation
with
Mr.
Gardiner.
Elizabeth
could
not
but
be
pleased,
could
not
but
triumph.
It
was
consoling
that
he
should
know
she
had
some
relations
for
whom
there
was
no
need
to
blush.
She
listened
most
attentively
to
all
that
passed
between
them,
and
gloried
in
every
expression,
every
sentence
of
her
uncle,
which
marked
his
intelligence,
his
taste,
or
his
good
manners.
The
conversation
soon
turned
upon
fishing;
and
she
heard
Mr.
Darcy
invite
him,
with
the
greatest
civility,
to
fish
there
as
often
as
he
chose
while
he
continued
in
the
neighbourhood,
offering
at
the
same
time
to
supply
him
with
fishing
tackle,
and
pointing
out
those
parts
of
the
stream
where
there
was
usually
most
sport.
Mrs.
Gardiner,
who
was
walking
arm
in
arm
with
Elizabeth,
gave
her
a
look
expressive
of
wonder.
Elizabeth
said
nothing,
but
it
gratified
her
exceedingly;
the
compliment
must
be
all
for
herself.
Her
astonishment,
however,
was
extreme,
and
continually
was
she
repeating,
"Why
is
he
so
altered?
From
what
can
it
proceed?
It
cannot
be
for
me
it
cannot
be
for
my
sake
that
his
manners
are
thus
softened.
My
reproofs
at
Hunsford
could
not
work
such
a
change
as
this.
It
is
impossible
that
he
should
still
love
me."
After
walking
some
time
in
this
way,
the
two
ladies
in
front,
the
two
gentlemen
behind,
on
resuming
their
places,
after
descending
to
the
brink
of
the
river
for
the
better
inspection
of
some
curious
water
plant,
there
chanced
to
be
a
little
alteration.
It
originated
in
Mrs.
Gardiner,
who,
fatigued
by
the
exercise
of
the
morning,
found
Elizabeth's
arm
inadequate
to
her
support,
and
consequently
preferred
her
husband's.
Mr.
Darcy
took
her
place
by
her
niece,
and
they
walked
on
together.
After
a
short
silence,
the
lady
first
spoke.
She
wished
him
to
know
that
she
had
been
assured
of
his
absence
before
she
came
to
the
place,
and
accordingly
began
by
observing,
that
his
arrival
had
been
very
unexpected
"for
your
housekeeper,"
she
added,
"informed
us
that
you
would
certainly
not
be
here
till
to
morrow;
and
indeed,
before
we
left
Bakewell,
we
understood
that
you
were
not
immediately
expected
in
the
country."
He
acknowledged
the
truth
of
it
all,
and
said
that
business
with
his
steward
had
occasioned
his
coming
forward
a
few
hours
before
