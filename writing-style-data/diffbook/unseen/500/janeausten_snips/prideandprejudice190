discharged,
and
something
still
to
remain!
Oh!
it
must
be
my
uncle's
doings!
Generous,
good
man,
I
am
afraid
he
has
distressed
himself.
A
small
sum
could
not
do
all
this."
"No,"
said
her
father;
"Wickham's
a
fool
if
he
takes
her
with
a
farthing
less
than
ten
thousand
pounds.
I
should
be
sorry
to
think
so
ill
of
him,
in
the
very
beginning
of
our
relationship."
"Ten
thousand
pounds!
Heaven
forbid!
How
is
half
such
a
sum
to
be
repaid?"
Mr.
Bennet
made
no
answer,
and
each
of
them,
deep
in
thought,
continued
silent
till
they
reached
the
house.
Their
father
then
went
on
to
the
library
to
write,
and
the
girls
walked
into
the
breakfast
room.
"And
they
are
really
to
be
married!"
cried
Elizabeth,
as
soon
as
they
were
by
themselves.
"How
strange
this
is!
And
for
this
we
are
to
be
thankful.
That
they
should
marry,
small
as
is
their
chance
of
happiness,
and
wretched
as
is
his
character,
we
are
forced
to
rejoice.
Oh,
Lydia!"
"I
comfort
myself
with
thinking,"
replied
Jane,
"that
he
certainly
would
not
marry
Lydia
if
he
had
not
a
real
regard
for
her.
Though
our
kind
uncle
has
done
something
towards
clearing
him,
I
cannot
believe
that
ten
thousand
pounds,
or
anything
like
it,
has
been
advanced.
He
has
children
of
his
own,
and
may
have
more.
How
could
he
spare
half
ten
thousand
pounds?"
"If
he
were
ever
able
to
learn
what
Wickham's
debts
have
been,"
said
Elizabeth,
"and
how
much
is
settled
on
his
side
on
our
sister,
we
shall
exactly
know
what
Mr.
Gardiner
has
done
for
them,
because
Wickham
has
not
sixpence
of
his
own.
The
kindness
of
my
uncle
and
aunt
can
never
be
requited.
Their
taking
her
home,
and
affording
her
their
personal
protection
and
countenance,
is
such
a
sacrifice
to
her
advantage
as
years
of
gratitude
cannot
enough
acknowledge.
By
this
time
she
is
actually
with
them!
If
such
goodness
does
not
make
her
miserable
now,
she
will
never
deserve
to
be
happy!
What
a
meeting
for
her,
when
she
first
sees
my
aunt!"
"We
must
endeavour
to
forget
all
that
has
passed
on
either
side,"
said
Jane:
"I
hope
and
trust
they
will
yet
be
happy.
His
consenting
to
marry
her
is
a
proof,
I
will
believe,
that
he
is
come
to
a
right
way
of
thinking.
Their
mutual
affection
will
steady
them;
and
I
flatter
myself
they
will
settle
so
quietly,
and
live
in
so
rational
a
manner,
as
may
in
time
make
their
past
imprudence
forgotten."
"Their
conduct
has
been
such,"
replied
Elizabeth,
"as
neither
you,
nor
I,
nor
anybody
can
ever
forget.
It
is
useless
to
talk
of
it."
It
now
occurred
to
the
girls
that
their
mother
was
in
all
likelihood
perfectly
ignorant
of
what
had
happened.
They
went
to
the
library,
therefore,
and
asked
their
father
whether
he
would
not
wish
them
to
make
it
known
to
her.
He
was
writing
and,
without
raising
his
head,
coolly
