a
motive
within
her
of
goodwill
which
could
not
be
overlooked.
It
was
gratitude;
gratitude,
not
merely
for
having
once
loved
her,
but
for
loving
her
still
well
enough
to
forgive
all
the
petulance
and
acrimony
of
her
manner
in
rejecting
him,
and
all
the
unjust
accusations
accompanying
her
rejection.
He
who,
she
had
been
persuaded,
would
avoid
her
as
his
greatest
enemy,
seemed,
on
this
accidental
meeting,
most
eager
to
preserve
the
acquaintance,
and
without
any
indelicate
display
of
regard,
or
any
peculiarity
of
manner,
where
their
two
selves
only
were
concerned,
was
soliciting
the
good
opinion
of
her
friends,
and
bent
on
making
her
known
to
his
sister.
Such
a
change
in
a
man
of
so
much
pride
exciting
not
only
astonishment
but
gratitude
for
to
love,
ardent
love,
it
must
be
attributed;
and
as
such
its
impression
on
her
was
of
a
sort
to
be
encouraged,
as
by
no
means
unpleasing,
though
it
could
not
be
exactly
defined.
She
respected,
she
esteemed,
she
was
grateful
to
him,
she
felt
a
real
interest
in
his
welfare;
and
she
only
wanted
to
know
how
far
she
wished
that
welfare
to
depend
upon
herself,
and
how
far
it
would
be
for
the
happiness
of
both
that
she
should
employ
the
power,
which
her
fancy
told
her
she
still
possessed,
of
bringing
on
her
the
renewal
of
his
addresses.
It
had
been
settled
in
the
evening
between
the
aunt
and
the
niece,
that
such
a
striking
civility
as
Miss
Darcy's
in
coming
to
see
them
on
the
very
day
of
her
arrival
at
Pemberley,
for
she
had
reached
it
only
to
a
late
breakfast,
ought
to
be
imitated,
though
it
could
not
be
equalled,
by
some
exertion
of
politeness
on
their
side;
and,
consequently,
that
it
would
be
highly
expedient
to
wait
on
her
at
Pemberley
the
following
morning.
They
were,
therefore,
to
go.
Elizabeth
was
pleased;
though
when
she
asked
herself
the
reason,
she
had
very
little
to
say
in
reply.
Mr.
Gardiner
left
them
soon
after
breakfast.
The
fishing
scheme
had
been
renewed
the
day
before,
and
a
positive
engagement
made
of
his
meeting
some
of
the
gentlemen
at
Pemberley
before
noon.
Convinced
as
Elizabeth
now
was
that
Miss
Bingley's
dislike
of
her
had
originated
in
jealousy,
she
could
not
help
feeling
how
unwelcome
her
appearance
at
Pemberley
must
be
to
her,
and
was
curious
to
know
with
how
much
civility
on
that
lady's
side
the
acquaintance
would
now
be
renewed.
On
reaching
the
house,
they
were
shown
through
the
hall
into
the
saloon,
whose
northern
aspect
rendered
it
delightful
for
summer.
Its
windows
opening
to
the
ground,
admitted
a
most
refreshing
view
of
the
high
woody
hills
behind
the
house,
and
of
the
beautiful
oaks
and
Spanish
chestnuts
which
were
scattered
over
the
intermediate
lawn.
In
this
house
they
were
received
by
Miss
Darcy,
who
was
sitting
there
with
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley,
and
the
lady
with
whom
she
lived
in
London.
Georgiana's
reception
of
them
was
